The theorem states that the product of two Gaussian functions centered at $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ is another Gaussian function. The exponent is manipulated by completing the square. The general result is:\n$$ \\exp\\left(-a|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{A}|^{2}\\right) \\exp\\left(-b|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{B}|^{2}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{ab}{a+b}|\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{B}|^{2}\\right) \\exp\\left(-(a+b)\\left|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{P}\\right|^{2}\\right) $$\nwhere the new center $\\mathbf{P}$ is defined as $\\mathbf{P} = \\frac{a\\mathbf{A} + b\\mathbf{B}}{a+b}$.\nIn our case, we have $a=\\alpha_{\\mu}$ and $b=\\alpha_{\\nu}$. Let $p = \\alpha_{\\mu} + \\alpha_{\\nu}$. The new center is $\\mathbf{P} = \\frac{\\alpha_{\\mu}\\mathbf{A} + \\alpha_{\\nu}\\mathbf{B}}{p}$.

The normalization condition for $\\phi_{\\mu}$ is $\\langle\\phi_{\\mu}|\\phi_{\\mu}\\rangle = 1$. This is a specific instance of the overlap integral where $\\nu = \\mu$, which means $\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{B}$, $R_{AB}=0$, and $\\alpha_{\\nu}=\\alpha_{\\mu}$.\n$$ \\langle\\phi_{\\mu}|\\phi_{\\mu}\\rangle = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}} \\left(N_{\\mu} \\exp\\left(-\\alpha_{\\mu}|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{A}|^{2}\\right)\\right)^{2} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r} = 1 $$\n$$ N_{\\mu}^{2} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}} \\exp\\left(-2\\alpha_{\\mu}|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{A}|^{2}\\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r} = 1 $$\nThis is again a 3D Gaussian integral, with an exponent constant of $c=2\\alpha_{\\mu}$.

Each case corresponds to a different internuclear separation $R$ (in Bohr) of $\\text{H}_2$. Your task for each case is to compute the two molecular orbital energies by solving $F \\mathbf{c} = \\varepsilon \\mathbf{c}$, and to report them in ascending order. All energies must be expressed in Hartree and rounded to six decimal places.\n\nTest suite (each case provides $R$, $F$, and $S$; you must ignore $S$ and use only $F$ when computing the eigenvalues):\n\n- Case $1$ ($R = 0.5$ Bohr):\n  - $F^{(1)} = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.5 & -0.8402976848102109 \\\\ -0.8402976848102109 & -0.5 \\end{pmatrix}$\n  - $S^{(1)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.0 & 0.9603402112116696 \\\\ 0.9603402112116696 & 1.0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- Case $2$ ($R = 1.4$ Bohr):\n  - $F^{(2)} = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.5 & -0.658824888663992 \\\\ -0.658824888663992 & -0.5 \\end{pmatrix}$\n  - $S^{(2)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.0 & 0.7529427299017052 \\\\ 0.7529427299017052 & 1.0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- Case $3$ ($R = 2.0$ Bohr):\n  - $F^{(3)} = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.5 & -0.5131462822721565 \\\\ -0.5131462822721565 & -0.5 \\end{pmatrix}$\n  - $S^{(3)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.0 & 0.5864528940253217 \\\\ 0.5864528940253217 & 1.0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- Case $4$ ($R = 4.0$ Bohr):\n  - $F^{(4)} = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.5 & -0.16560390161897155 \\\\ -0.16560390161897155 & -0.5 \\end{pmatrix}$\n  - $S^{(4)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.0 & 0.1892616018502532 \\\\ 0.1892616018502532 & 1.0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nRequirements:\n\n- For each case, compute the two eigenvalues of $F$ (in Hartree), sort them in ascending order, and round each to six decimal places.\n- Aggregate the results of all four cases into a single line: a list of four sublists, each sublist containing the two rounded eigenvalues for that case.\n- Final output format: a single line containing the results as a comma-separated list of sublists with no spaces, for example, $[[a_1,a_2],[b_1,b_2],[c_1,c_2],[d_1,d_2]]$, where each symbol represents a decimal number rounded to six places.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets with no spaces (for example, $[[e_{11},e_{12}],[e_{21},e_{22}],[e_{31},e_{32}],[e_{41},e_{42}]]$).", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated. It presents a well-defined mathematical task within a clear, albeit idealized, scientific context. The problem is self-contained, its parameters are consistent, and it possesses a unique solution. The deliberate use of the physically incorrect assumption that the overlap matrix $S$ is the identity matrix $I$ does not invalidate the problem as a computational exercise; it merely sets the conditions for it. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires solving the Hartree-Fock-Roothaan (HFR) equations for the hydrogen molecule, $H_2$, in a minimal basis. The general form of these equations is the generalized eigenvalue problem:\n$$F \\mathbf{c} = S \\mathbf{c} \\varepsilon$$\nwhere $F$ is the Fock matrix, $S$ is the overlap matrix, $\\mathbf{c}$ is the vector of molecular orbital coefficients, and $\\varepsilon$ represents the orbital energies. The problem instructs us to make the simplifying, though physically incorrect, assumption that the basis functions are orthonormal. This implies setting the overlap matrix $S$ to the identity matrix $I$, which reduces the HFR equation to the standard eigenvalue problem:\n$$F \\mathbf{c} = \\varepsilon \\mathbf{c}$$\nOur task is to find the eigenvalues $\\varepsilon$ for several given $2 \\times 2$ Fock matrices.\n\nFor a general $2 \\times 2$ matrix $M = \\begin{pmatrix} m_{11} & m_{12} \\\\ m_{21} & m_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$, the eigenvalues $\\varepsilon$ are the roots of the characteristic polynomial $\\det(M - \\varepsilon I) = 0$.\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} m_{11} - \\varepsilon & m_{12} \\\\ m_{21} & m_{22} - \\varepsilon \\end{pmatrix} = (m_{11} - \\varepsilon)(m_{22} - \\varepsilon) - m_{12}m_{21} = 0\n$$\nIn this problem, all provided Fock matrices $F$ are real and symmetric, with the specific structure derived from the symmetry of the $H_2$ molecule:\n$$\nF = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ b & a \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $a = -0.5$ and $b$ is a negative real number representing the resonance integral, which depends on the internuclear distance $R$.\n\nThe characteristic equation for this specific form is:\n$$\n(a - \\varepsilon)^2 - b^2 = 0\n$$\nThis leads to a simple analytical solution for the eigenvalues:\n$$\na - \\varepsilon = \\pm b\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon = a \\mp b\n$$\nThe two molecular orbital energies are therefore $\\varepsilon_1 = a - b$ and $\\varepsilon_2 = a + b$. Since $b$ is negative in all given cases, $a+b$ will correspond to the lower energy (bonding) orbital, and $a-b$ will correspond to the higher energy (antibonding) orbital. The task requires reporting them in ascending order, which is $[\\varepsilon_2, \\varepsilon_1]$.\n\nLet us demonstrate the procedure for Case 1 ($R = 0.5$ Bohr):\nThe Fock matrix is given as:\n$$\nF^{(1)} = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.5 & -0.8402976848102109 \\\\ -0.8402976848102109 & -0.5 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nHere, $a = -0.5$ and $b = -0.8402976848102109$.\nThe orbital energies are:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{lower} = a + b = -0.5 + (-0.8402976848102109) = -1.3402976848102109 \\, \\text{Hartree}\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{upper} = a - b = -0.5 - (-0.8402976848102109) = 0.3402976848102109 \\, \\text{Hartree}\n$$\nRounding these values to six decimal places, we obtain $-1.340298$ and $0.340298$.\n\nApplying this same rigorous procedure to all four cases yields the following molecular orbital energies, sorted in ascending order and rounded to six decimal places:\n\nCase $1$ ($R=0.5$ Bohr): $[-1.340298, 0.340298]$\nCase $2$ ($R=1.4$ Bohr): $[-1.158825, 0.158825]$\nCase $3$ ($R=2.0$ Bohr): $[-1.013146, 0.013146]$\nCase $4$ ($R=4.0$ Bohr): $[-0.665604, -0.334396]$\n\nA numerical program will be written to perform these calculations systematically, ensuring precision and adherence to the specified output format. The program will diagonalize each matrix $F^{(i)}$ to find its eigenvalues, sort them, round them, and format the results as requested.
