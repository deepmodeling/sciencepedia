These atomic orbitals are, in turn, described by a set of mathematical functions known as a basis set. A common type of minimal basis set is the STO-3G basis, where STO stands for Slater-Type Orbital. In a minimal basis set, one basis function is used to represent each atomic orbital required to accommodate all the electrons of the neutral atom in its ground state. This includes both core and valence orbitals.\n\nConsider the formaldehyde molecule, which has the chemical formula $\\text{CH}_2\\text{O}$.\n\nCalculate the total number of basis functions required to describe the formaldehyde molecule using a minimal basis set like STO-3G.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of basis functions for the formaldehyde molecule ($\\text{CH}_2\\text{O}$) when described by a minimal basis set. The problem states that a minimal basis set includes one basis function for each occupied core and valence atomic orbital of a neutral atom in its ground state. The total number of basis functions for the molecule is the sum of the basis functions for each of its constituent atoms. The formaldehyde molecule is composed of one carbon atom (C), two hydrogen atoms (H), and one oxygen atom (O).\n\nFirst, we determine the number of basis functions for a single hydrogen atom (H).\nA neutral hydrogen atom has an atomic number of 1. Its ground-state electron configuration is $1s^1$. The only occupied atomic orbital is the $1s$ orbital. Therefore, a minimal basis set for a hydrogen atom requires 1 basis function corresponding to the $1s$ orbital.\n\nNext, we determine the number of basis functions for a single carbon atom (C).\nA neutral carbon atom has an atomic number of 6. Its ground-state electron configuration is $1s^2 2s^2 2p^2$. The occupied atomic orbitals are the $1s$ (core), $2s$ (valence), and the three $2p$ orbitals ($2p_x$, $2p_y$, $2p_z$) (valence). Even though only two electrons are in the $2p$ subshell, all three $p$-orbitals are included to allow for proper bonding description. The set of atomic orbitals is $\\{1s, 2s, 2p_x, 2p_y, 2p_z\\}$. Counting these orbitals gives a total of $1 + 1 + 3 = 5$ basis functions for a carbon atom.\n\nThen, we determine the number of basis functions for a single oxygen atom (O).\nA neutral oxygen atom has an atomic number of 8. Its ground-state electron configuration is $1s^2 2s^2 2p^4$. Similar to carbon, the occupied atomic orbitals are the $1s$ (core), $2s$ (valence), and the three $2p$ orbitals ($2p_x$, $2p_y$, $2p_z$) (valence). The set of atomic orbitals is $\\{1s, 2s, 2p_x, 2p_y, 2p_z\\}$. This gives a total of $1 + 1 + 3 = 5$ basis functions for an oxygen atom.\n\nFinally, we sum the number of basis functions for all atoms in the formaldehyde molecule ($\\text{CH}_2\\text{O}$).\nThe molecule consists of:\n- One carbon atom, which contributes 5 basis functions.\n- Two hydrogen atoms, each contributing 1 basis function, for a total of $2 \\times 1 = 2$ basis functions.\n- One oxygen atom, which contributes 5 basis functions.\n\nThe total number of basis functions is the sum of these contributions:\n$$ \\text{Total basis functions} = (\\text{functions for C}) + 2 \\times (\\text{functions for H}) + (\\text{functions for O}) $$\n$$ \\text{Total basis functions} = 5 + 2 \\times 1 + 5 = 12 $$\nTherefore, a minimal basis set description of the formaldehyde molecule requires 12 basis functions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12}$$", "id": "1380727"}, {"introduction": "While counting basis functions is important, a deeper understanding comes from appreciating their physical character.

A minimal basis set assigns one basis function to each occupied atomic orbital of the isolated atom.\n2.  An STO-$n$G basis set approximates each Slater-type orbital (STO) with a fixed linear combination of $n$ normalized Gaussian-type orbital (GTO) primitives.\n3.

The hypothetical \"STO-$1$G\" is a logical extension of the STO-$n$G scheme to the case where $n=1$.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The question is clearly formulated. It asks for the design and primary flaw of a hypothetical but well-defined entity (STO-$1$G) in comparison to a known standard (STO-$3$G). A unique and meaningful answer can be derived from first principles.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is phrased in objective, technical language, free from ambiguity or subjective content.\n\nThe problem statement does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution and evaluation of options will be performed.\n\nDerivation of the correct answer begins with the fundamental definitions. A Slater-type orbital (for the $1s$ case) has the functional form $\\phi_{STO} \\propto e^{-\\zeta r}$, where $\\zeta$ is the orbital exponent and $r$ is the distance from the nucleus. This function has two critical features:\n1.  A non-zero derivative at the nucleus ($r=0$), which forms a \"cusp\". This is required by the Kato cusp condition for an exact wavefunction.\n2.  An exponential decay, $e^{-\\zeta r}$, at long range ($r \\to \\infty$).\n\nA Gaussian-type orbital has the functional form $\\phi_{GTO} \\propto e^{-\\alpha r^2}$, where $\\alpha$ is the Gaussian exponent. This function has two contrasting features:\n1.  A zero derivative at the nucleus ($r=0$). It has a \"bell\" shape, not a cusp.\n2.  A much faster decay, $e^{-\\alpha r^2}$, at long range.\n\nThe STO-$n$G method constructs an approximation to an STO using a linear combination of $n$ GTOs:\n$$ \\phi_{STO-nG}(r) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i e^{-\\alpha_i r^2} $$\nThe coefficients $d_i$ and exponents $\\alpha_i$ are pre-determined (usually via a least-squares fit) to make the sum of Gaussians mimic the target STO.\n\nIn the case of STO-$3$G ($n=3$), three Gaussians are used. This allows for some flexibility. A \"tight\" Gaussian (large $\\alpha$) can be used to approximate the function near the nucleus, while more \"diffuse\" Gaussians (small $\\alpha$) can be used to model the long-range tail. The combination provides a passable, though still imperfect, approximation of the STO's shape.\n\nNow, consider the hypothetical STO-$1$G basis set. Here, $n=1$. Each STO is approximated by a single GTO:\n$$ \\phi_{STO-1G}(r) = d_1 e^{-\\alpha_1 r^2} $$\nThe coefficient $d_1$ is a normalization constant. This leaves only one parameter, the exponent $\\alpha_1$, to be optimized. The goal is to choose $\\alpha_1$ such that the single Gaussian $e^{-\\alpha_1 r^2}$ is the \"best\" possible fit to the target STO $e^{-\\zeta r}$. This optimization is typically done by minimizing the least-squares difference between the two functions.\n\nThe most significant physical flaw arises directly from the mismatch in the fundamental shapes of the two functions. A single Gaussian function cannot simultaneously satisfy the two key requirements of an STO:\n-   It cannot reproduce the cusp at $r=0$.\n-   Its tail behaviour, $e^{-\\alpha r^2}$, is qualitatively incorrect compared to the STO's $e^{-\\zeta r}$ decay.\n\nWith only one exponent $\\alpha_1$, a compromise must be made. If $\\alpha_1$ is chosen large to model the region near the nucleus, the orbital's tail will decay far too rapidly, leading to a poor description of the valence region and chemical bonding. If $\\alpha_1$ is chosen small to better model the tail, the function will be far too flat near the nucleus, drastically underestimating the electron density there. This fundamental inability to correctly model both the nuclear region and the tail region due to having only a single Gaussian function is the primary source of error. This is a severe lack of *radial flexibility*. Compared to STO-$3$G, which has some limited flexibility to address this trade-off, STO-$1$G is expected to perform extremely poorly, yielding inaccurate electron densities, energies, and molecular geometries.\n\nEvaluation of Options:\n\nA. Use one normalized Gaussian-type orbital (GTO) primitive for each atomic orbital, with a single exponent $\\,\\alpha\\,$ chosen (e.g., by variational fitting or least-squares to a reference Slater exponent) to mimic the corresponding Slater-type orbital (STO). The key physical flaw is the severe lack of radial flexibility: with only one Gaussian $e^{-\\alpha r^2}$ you cannot simultaneously approximate the correct near-nuclear cusp and the correct long-range exponential decay, leading to significantly poorer electron density near nuclei and in bonding regions than STO-$3$G.\nThis option correctly describes the construction of an STO-$1$G basis function as a single GTO with an optimized exponent $\\alpha$. It correctly identifies the primary flaw as the lack of radial flexibility inherent in a single Gaussian, which cannot simultaneously model the nuclear cusp and the long-range tail of an STO. The consequences described—poor electron density near nuclei and in bonding regions—are accurate.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Use one exact Slater-type orbital (STO) per atomic orbital, with a single Slater exponent $\\,\\zeta\\,$ taken from atomic calculations. The key physical flaw is that the basis grossly overestimates electron–electron repulsion integrals because exponential functions yield divergent two-electron integrals at short range compared to STO-$3$G.\nThis option is incorrect for two reasons. First, it describes a basis set of pure STOs, not an STO-$1$G basis set, which by definition uses Gaussian functions to approximate STOs. The entire purpose of the STO-$n$G scheme is to avoid the computational difficulty of integrals over STOs. Second, the claim that two-electron integrals involving STOs are \"divergent\" is false. They are computationally difficult and expensive, but they are finite and well-defined.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Use one normalized Gaussian-type orbital (GTO) primitive per atomic orbital with a very small exponent $\\,\\alpha\\,$ to emphasize the tail region. The key physical flaw is that this choice produces electron density collapse at the nucleus that is more severe than in STO-$3$G.\nThis option makes a specific, but poor, choice for $\\alpha$ (very small). A small exponent creates a very diffuse Gaussian, which is flat near the nucleus. This would lead to a severe *underestimation* of electron density at the nucleus, not a \"collapse\". An electron density collapse (a sharp peak) would require a very large exponent $\\alpha$. The described flaw is the opposite of what would occur.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Use one normalized Gaussian-type orbital (GTO) primitive per atomic orbital with an exponent $\\,\\alpha\\,$ tuned to reproduce the exact electron–nucleus cusp at $r=0$. The key physical flaw is that the resulting orbital has an unphysical long-range decay proportional to $1/r$, unlike STO-$3$G.\nThis option contains two fundamental errors. First, it is mathematically impossible for a GTO, which has zero slope at $r=0$, to reproduce the non-zero slope (cusp) of an STO at $r=0$. Second, the long-range decay of a GTO is Gaussian ($e^{-\\alpha r^2}$), not proportional to $1/r$. The physics described is wrong.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. Use one normalized Gaussian-type orbital (GTO) primitive per atomic orbital with a contraction coefficient optimized for orthonormality. The key physical flaw is that the basis violates orthonormality between basis functions, whereas STO-$3$G maintains exact orthonormality across all atomic orbitals.\nThis option is flawed. For an STO-$1$G basis, there is only one primitive per basis function, so the contraction coefficient is fixed at $1$ (for a normalized primitive). There is no coefficient to optimize. More critically, the premise that STO-$3$G basis functions are orthogonal is false. Atomic orbital basis sets centered on different atoms are in general non-orthogonal. This non-orthogonality (measured by the overlap matrix $S$) is handled computationally during the self-consistent field (SCF) procedure, not by the design of the basis functions themselves.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2457822"}]}
