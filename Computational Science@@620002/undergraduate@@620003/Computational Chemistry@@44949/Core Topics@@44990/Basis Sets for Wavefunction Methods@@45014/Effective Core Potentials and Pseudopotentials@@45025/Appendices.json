Here, the numerator becomes $e^0(0+0+1) - e^{-2Zr_s}(...)$, which is identical to the denominator, yielding $R(Z,0,r_s)=1$. This is correct, as an ECP with a core radius of zero is equivalent to the all-electron calculation.\n\nThis closed-form expression for $R(Z,r_c,r_s)$ is implemented to evaluate the specified test cases.\n\nThe physical interpretation demonstrates the failure of this naive ECP approach. Effective Core Potentials are constructed to reproduce valence properties, such as orbital energies and the spatial distribution of the electron density far from the nucleus. They achieve this by replacing the strong Coulombic potential and the complex effects of the core electrons with a weaker pseudopotential. This procedure yields nodeless valence pseudo-wavefunctions that are computationally convenient but physically incorrect in the core region ($r  r_c$).\n\nProperties such as the Fermi contact interaction, electric field gradients at the nucleus, and Mössbauer isomer shifts depend critically on the electron density and its gradient at or very near the nucleus ($r \\to 0$). The ECP model, by its very design, removes the core electrons and sets the electron density to zero in this critical region. As shown in our calculation for the case $(Z, r_c, r_s) = (1, 0.2, 0.2)$, if the sampling radius $r_s$ is smaller than or equal to the core radius $r_c$, the ECP-based observable is exactly zero. This is a catastrophic failure, producing an infinite relative error compared to the non-zero all-electron result.\n\nEven when $r_c  r_s$, the ECP result is highly sensitive to the artificial parameter $r_c$. For a heavier atom with larger $Z$ (e.g., $Z=10$), the core density is much more concentrated near the nucleus. Removing this density even for a small $r_c$ (e.g., $0.05$ a.u.) leads to a grossly incorrect result, as seen in the test case $(10, 0.05, 0.2)$ which yields an error over $10\\%$. The value of $r_c$ is a parameter of computational convenience, not a physical observable. Any computed property that depends strongly on $r_c$ is, by definition, an unphysical artifact. The conclusion is inescapable: ECPs are fundamentally unsuitable for computing properties that depend on the electron density inside the core region. Attempting to do so is a misuse of the method and leads to nonsensical, arbitrary results.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of computing the ratio R(Z, r_c, r_s) for a set of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    test_cases = [\n        (1, 0.05, 0.2),  # Z, r_c, r_s in atomic units\n        (1, 0.2, 0.2),\n        (6, 0.02, 0.2),\n        (10, 0.05, 0.2),\n        (2, 0.0, 0.2),\n    ]\n\n    def calculate_R(Z, r_c, r_s):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the ratio R for a given set of parameters Z, r_c, and r_s.\n\n        The ratio is defined as:\n        R = [exp(-2*Z*r_c)*P(r_c) - exp(-2*Z*r_s)*P(r_s)] / [1 - exp(-2*Z*r_s)*P(r_s)]\n        where P(r) = (2*Z^2*r^2 + 2*Z*r + 1).\n\n        Args:\n            Z (float): Nuclear charge.\n            r_c (float): Core radius.\n            r_s (float): Smearing radius.\n\n        Returns:\n            float: The calculated ratio R.\n        \"\"\"\n        # If the core radius is greater than or equal to the smearing radius,\n        # the ECP observable integral becomes zero.\n        if r_c = r_s:\n            return 0.0\n\n        # Define a helper function for the polynomial term P(r) = 2*Z^2*r^2 + 2*Z*r + 1\n        def poly(r, Z_val):\n            term1 = 2 * (Z_val * r)**2\n            term2 = 2 * Z_val * r\n            return term1 + term2 + 1\n\n        # Calculate exponential terms\n        exp_rc = np.exp(-2 * Z * r_c)\n        exp_rs = np.exp(-2 * Z * r_s)\n        \n        # Calculate polynomial terms\n        poly_rc = poly(r_c, Z)\n        poly_rs = poly(r_s, Z)\n\n        # Numerator of the ratio R\n        numerator = exp_rc * poly_rc - exp_rs * poly_rs\n        \n        # Denominator of the ratio R\n        denominator = 1.0 - exp_rs * poly_rs\n\n        # It is a mathematical certainty that for r_s  0 the denominator is non-zero.\n        # The integrated probability inside the sphere must be less than 1, so\n        # 4*pi*I_AE  1, which implies 1 - exp(...)*P(...)  0.\n        if denominator == 0:\n            # This case physically corresponds to r_s - infinity, where R-1.\n            # For finite r_s, this should not happen.
