The Pople-style basis sets, like 6-31G, offer a systematic way to construct these sets. The notation provides a recipe for the number of functions used to represent the atomic orbitals of each atom in a molecule.\n\nConsider a single molecule of formaldehyde, which has the chemical formula $CH_2O$. A computational study is planned using the 6-31G basis set. To begin estimating the resources needed, you must first determine the total number of contracted basis functions for the entire molecule.\n\nThe rules for interpreting the 6-31G basis set are as follows:\n*   For any second-row atom (from Lithium to Neon), the core 1s orbital is represented by a single contracted basis function. The valence shell (containing 2s and 2p orbitals) is represented by two sets of functions: an \"inner\" set and an \"outer\" set. The inner set consists of one s-type function and one set of p-type functions. The outer set also consists of one s-type function and one set of p-type functions.\n*   For a Hydrogen atom, its 1s valence orbital is represented by two separate s-type contracted functions.\n*   Note that a \"set of p-type functions\" always includes three distinct functions: $p_x$, $p_y$, and $p_z$.\n\nCalculate the total number of contracted basis functions for one molecule of formaldehyde ($CH_2O$) using the 6-31G basis set.", "solution": "We identify the atoms in formaldehyde CH$_{2}$O: one carbon (C), two hydrogens (H), and one oxygen (O). Carbon and oxygen are second-row atoms.\n\nBy the given 6-31G interpretation:\n- For each second-row atom, the contracted functions are the sum of the core 1s function and the valence split functions. The core contributes $1$ s-type function. Each valence set consists of one s-type function and one set of p-type functions, and each p-set contains $3$ functions ($p_{x}$, $p_{y}$, $p_{z}$). There are two such valence sets (inner and outer).\n- Therefore, for one second-row atom:\n$$\nN_{\\text{second-row}} = 1 + (1 + 3) + (1 + 3) = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\nN_{\\text{C}} = 9,\\quad N_{\\text{O}} = 9.\n$$\n\nFor hydrogen, the 6-31G basis assigns two separate s-type contracted functions to the 1s valence orbital:\n$$\nN_{\\text{H}} = 2.\n$$\nSince there are two hydrogens,\n$$\nN_{\\text{2H}} = 2 \\times N_{\\text{H}} = 2 \\times 2 = 4.\n$$\n\nSumming all contracted basis functions for CH$_{2}$O:\n$$\nN_{\\text{total}} = N_{\\text{C}} + N_{\\text{O}} + N_{\\text{2H}} = 9 + 9 + 4 = 22.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{22}$$", "id": "1398994"}, {"introduction": "Understanding what a computational model *doesn't* account for is as important as knowing what it does. This thought experiment challenges you to apply the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, a cornerstone of quantum chemistry that separates the motion of electrons from that of nuclei. By exploring why standard calculations yield identical electronic energies for isotopes like $H_2$ and $D_2$ at a fixed geometry, you will solidify your understanding of the precise nature of the electronic potential energy surface [@problem_id:1398967].", "problem": "An undergraduate student, Alex, is performing a series of *ab initio* quantum chemistry calculations on hydrogen and its heavier isotope, deuterium. Alex computes the ground-state electronic energy of a single dihydrogen molecule ($H_2$) at a fixed internuclear distance of $R = 0.741$ Angstroms using the 6-31G basis set. Next, Alex performs the exact same calculation for a single dideuterium molecule ($D_2$) at the same internuclear distance $R$, using the same 6-31G basis set and level of theory. To Alex's surprise, the electronic energy obtained for $D_2$ is identical to the electronic energy obtained for $H_2$. Alex knows from spectroscopy that $H_2$ and $D_2$ have different bond dissociation energies and vibrational frequencies, and thus expected the calculation to yield different energies.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for why the electronic energies calculated for $H_2$ and $D_2$ are identical in this computational setup?\n\nA. The 6-31G basis set is a relatively small basis set and lacks the flexibility (e.g., polarization and diffuse functions) required to distinguish between isotopes. A much larger basis set, such as aug-cc-pVQZ, would show a difference in the electronic energies.\n\nB. The electronic Schrödinger equation, as solved in standard quantum chemistry calculations under the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation, depends only on the positions and charges of the nuclei, not their masses. The basis set is used to describe the behavior of the electrons for this fixed nuclear framework.\n\nC. The student's observation is incorrect and likely due to a software error. The difference in nuclear mass leads to a different reduced mass for the molecule, which must alter the electronic wavefunction and therefore the electronic energy, even if the effect is small.\n\nD. The Gaussian functions in the 6-31G basis set are centered on the nuclear positions. Since the mass of deuterium is different from hydrogen, the center of mass of the nucleus is slightly shifted, causing an artifact that coincidentally cancels the expected energy difference.\n\nE. The identity of the calculated energies is an artifact of neglecting the zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE). The total energy, which is the sum of the electronic and vibrational energies, would be different, and modern electronic structure theory is only designed to be accurate for this total energy, not the electronic part alone.", "solution": "We identify the core theoretical framework: in standard quantum chemistry for a fixed nuclear geometry, the electronic energy is obtained by solving the clamped-nuclei (Born-Oppenheimer) electronic Schrödinger equation. The total molecular Hamiltonian can be written as\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\hat{T}_{n} + \\hat{H}_{e}(\\{\\mathbf{r}_{i}\\}; \\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}),\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{T}_{n}$ is the nuclear kinetic energy operator and $\\hat{H}_{e}$ is the electronic Hamiltonian with nuclei treated as fixed point charges at positions $\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}$. Under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, one first solves the electronic eigenproblem\n$$\n\\hat{H}_{e}(\\{\\mathbf{r}_{i}\\}; \\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}) \\Psi_{e} = E_{e}(\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}) \\Psi_{e}.\n$$\nThe explicit form of the clamped-nuclei electronic Hamiltonian is\n$$\n\\hat{H}_{e} = \\sum_{i}^{N_{e}} \\left( -\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2 m_{e}} \\nabla_{i}^{2} \\right)\n- \\sum_{i,A} \\frac{Z_{A} e^{2}}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} |\\mathbf{r}_{i} - \\mathbf{R}_{A}|}\n+ \\sum_{i<j} \\frac{e^{2}}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} |\\mathbf{r}_{i} - \\mathbf{r}_{j}|}\n+ \\sum_{A<B} \\frac{Z_{A} Z_{B} e^{2}}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} |\\mathbf{R}_{A} - \\mathbf{R}_{B}|}.\n$$\nCrucially, $\\hat{H}_{e}$ depends on the electron mass $m_{e}$, the nuclear charges $Z_{A}$, and the nuclear positions $\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}$, but it does not contain the nuclear masses $M_{A}$. The nuclear masses $M_{A}$ appear only in the nuclear kinetic operator\n$$\n\\hat{T}_{n} = - \\sum_{A} \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2 M_{A}} \\nabla_{A}^{2},\n$$\nwhich is not part of the clamped-nuclei electronic problem.\n\nFor $H_2$ and $D_2$ at the same internuclear distance $R$, we have identical nuclear charges ($Z_{A}=1$ for both isotopes) and identical nuclear positions $\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}$. Therefore, the operator $\\hat{H}_{e}$ is identical for $H_2$ and $D_2$. Since the operator is identical, the electronic eigenvalues $E_{e}(\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\})$ are identical for both species when computed at the same geometry and level of theory. A basis set, such as 6-31G, provides an approximate representation of $\\Psi_{e}$ for this fixed nuclear framework; it does not introduce nuclear-mass dependence into $\\hat{H}_{e}$ and hence cannot create an isotope dependence in $E_{e}$ at fixed geometry. Enlarging the basis (for example, to aug-cc-pVQZ) improves the approximation to the same mass-independent eigenvalue and does not break the equality between isotopologues.\n\nThe observed spectroscopic differences (vibrational frequencies and bond dissociation energies including zero-point vibrational energy) arise when solving the nuclear Schrödinger equation on the electronic potential energy surface $E_{e}(\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\})$, where\n$$\n\\hat{T}_{n} \\chi(\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}) + E_{e}(\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}) \\chi(\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}) = E_{\\text{tot}} \\chi(\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}).\n$$\nFor a diatomic molecule, the vibrational level spacings and zero-point energies depend on the reduced mass\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{M_{1} M_{2}}{M_{1} + M_{2}},\n$$\nwhich differs for $H_2$ and $D_2$. Hence vibrational frequencies and total energies including zero-point vibrational energy differ, even though the clamped-nuclei electronic energy $E_{e}$ at a fixed $R$ is the same.\n\nBeyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, there are small corrections such as the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction (DBOC) and mass-polarization terms that introduce a dependence on $M_{A}^{-1}$ into an effective electronic energy. However, standard electronic structure calculations that report the electronic energy at a fixed geometry typically do not include these terms by default, and even if included, they are small corrections; the fundamental mass-independence of $\\hat{H}_{e}$ within the clamped-nuclei framework remains the primary reason for the equality observed here.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is that under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation the electronic energy depends only on nuclear charges and positions, not on nuclear masses. This matches option B. Options A, C, D, and E are incorrect for the following reasons:\n- A is incorrect because basis set size does not introduce nuclear-mass dependence into the clamped-nuclei electronic Hamiltonian; a larger basis would not change the equality across isotopologues at fixed geometry.\n- C is incorrect because, within the standard BO electronic problem, nuclear mass does not alter the electronic wavefunction or energy; any mass dependence arises only beyond BO and is not the default in typical calculations.\n- D is incorrect because Gaussian basis functions are centered on nuclear positions, which are the same; the nuclear center of mass is irrelevant to $\\hat{H}_{e}$ at fixed geometry.\n- E is incorrect as a cause of identical electronic energies: zero-point vibrational energy is a nuclear motion contribution added to $E_{e}$; neglecting it cannot explain the equality of $E_{e}$ itself, and modern electronic structure theory is explicitly designed to compute $E_{e}$ accurately.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1398967"}, {"introduction": "While standard split-valence basis sets are a good starting point, achieving chemical accuracy often requires targeted improvements.

The geometry of H₂O is dominated by the H-O-H bond angle, which is dictated by the electronic environment of the central oxygen atom.\n\n-   **Choice A: Add d-type functions on oxygen.** This is the correct choice. Polarization functions provide angular flexibility. For oxygen, adding `d`-functions allows its valence `p`-orbitals to deform, which is essential for accurately describing the anisotropic electron density of its two bonds and two lone pairs. This has the most significant impact on calculating the correct bent geometry and bond angle.\n\n-   **Choice B: Add p-type functions on hydrogen.** While adding `p`-functions to hydrogen is important for accurately describing bond polarity and is crucial for intermolecular interactions (like hydrogen bonds), their effect on the intramolecular bond angle is secondary to that of polarization functions on the central atom.\n\n-   **Choice C: Add diffuse functions on oxygen.** Diffuse functions are designed to describe very spread-out electron density, which is characteristic of anions or excited states. For describing the covalent bonding and geometry of a neutral ground-state molecule like water, angular flexibility (from polarization functions) is far more critical than adding diffuse functions.\n\n-   **Choice D: Add both d-on-O and p-on-H.** This option is invalid because it violates the problem's constraint of adding \"exactly 1 set\" of polarization functions. The `6-31G(d,p)` basis set, while superior, involves adding two sets.
