This mass difference leads to a separation of timescales: electronic motion is much faster than nuclear motion (vibration and rotation). The problem requires a quantitative verification of this separation for a specific case, the water molecule $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$.\n\nFirst, we define the characteristic time for electronic motion, $\\tau_e$. A natural choice for this timescale is derived from the lowest electronic excitation energy, $\\Delta E$, through the fundamental Planck-Einstein relation, $\\Delta E = h \\nu_e$, where $\\nu_e$ is the frequency of a photon with this energy. The characteristic time is the period corresponding to this frequency:\n$$\n\\tau_e = \\frac{1}{\\nu_e} = \\frac{h}{\\Delta E}\n$$\n\nNext, we define the characteristic time for nuclear motion, specifically the bending vibration, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{vib}}$. This is simply the period of the vibration. We are given the wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$. The relationship between wavenumber, frequency $\\nu_{\\mathrm{vib}}$, and the speed of light $c$ is $\\nu_{\\mathrm{vib}} = c \\tilde{\\nu}$. The period of this vibration is the inverse of its frequency:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{vib}} = \\frac{1}{\\nu_{\\mathrm{vib}}} = \\frac{1}{c \\tilde{\\nu}}\n$$\n\nNow, we can compute the dimensionless ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{vib}}}{\\tau_{e}} = \\frac{1 / (c \\tilde{\\nu})}{h / \\Delta E} = \\frac{\\Delta E}{h c \\tilde{\\nu}}\n$$\nThis ratio directly compares the energy of electronic excitation to the energy of a vibrational quantum. This is equivalent to comparing the associated timescales.\n\nTo perform the calculation, we must ensure all quantities are in a consistent system of units, for which we will use the International System of Units (SI) for energy (Joules, $J$).
