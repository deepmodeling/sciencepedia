It presents a clear, albeit simple, physical scenario for which the composition of the quantum mechanical Hamiltonian is to be analyzed. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe general non-relativistic electronic Hamiltonian operator, $\\hat{H}$, within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation for a system of $N_e$ electrons and $N_A$ nuclei is given by:\n$$ \\hat{H} = \\hat{T}_e + \\hat{V}_{en} + \\hat{V}_{ee} $$\nHere, $\\hat{T}_e$ is the electron kinetic energy operator, $\\hat{V}_{en}$ is the electron-nuclear attraction potential energy operator, and $\\hat{V}_{ee}$ is the electron-electron repulsion potential energy operator.\n\nThe problem also mentions two other terms:\n$1$. The nuclear-nuclear repulsion, $V_{nn}$, which is a constant scalar value within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, not an operator in the electronic Hamiltonian. It contributes to the total energy $E_{\\text{total}} = E_{\\text{electronic}} + V_{nn}$.\n$2$. An external one-body potential, $\\hat{V}_{\\text{ext}}$, which is added to the Hamiltonian if external fields are present: $\\hat{H}' = \\hat{H} + \\hat{V}_{\\text{ext}}$.\n\nThe problem specifies a system with the following properties:\n- A single electron, so the number of electrons is $N_e = 1$.\n- No nuclei, so the number of nuclei is $N_A = 0$.\n- No applied external classical fields, which implies that the external potential function $v_{\\text{ext}}(\\mathbf{r})$ is identically zero for all positions $\\mathbf{r}$.\n\nWe will now evaluate each of the five terms provided in the options under these conditions.\n\nA. Electron–electron repulsion term, $V_{ee} = \\sum_{i<j}\\dfrac{1}{\\lvert \\mathbf r_i - \\mathbf r_j \\rvert}$\nThis term represents the electrostatic repulsion between all unique pairs of electrons. The summation indices $i$ and $j$ run from $1$ to $N_e$, with the constraint $i < j$. In this system, $N_e = 1$. It is impossible to choose two distinct indices $i$ and $j$ from the set $\\{1\\}$ such that $i < j$. The sum is over an empty set of pairs. By definition, a sum over an empty set is $0$. Therefore, the electron-electron repulsion term is identically zero: $V_{ee} = 0$.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nB. Electron–nuclear attraction term, $V_{en} = -\\sum_{i,A}\\dfrac{Z_A}{\\lvert \\mathbf r_i - \\mathbf R_A \\rvert}$\nThis term describes the electrostatic attraction between electrons and nuclei. The summation is over all electrons (index $i$, from $1$ to $N_e$) and all nuclei (index $A$, from $1$ to $N_A$). The problem states there are no nuclei, so $N_A = 0$. The sum over the index $A$ is an empty sum, which evaluates to $0$. Consequently, the entire expression for $V_{en}$ is identically zero: $V_{en} = 0$.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nC. Electron kinetic energy term, $T_e = -\\dfrac{1}{2}\\sum_i \\nabla_i^2$\nThis term represents the kinetic energy of the electrons. The summation is over all electrons, index $i$ running from $1$ to $N_e$. Since $N_e = 1$, the sum contains a single term:\n$$ T_e = -\\dfrac{1}{2}\\nabla_1^2 $$\nThis is the kinetic energy operator for a single electron. This is a non-zero operator. For a free electron, which this system describes, the wavefunction can be a plane wave $\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = A e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}$, and the application of this operator yields the kinetic energy eigenvalue $\\dfrac{k^2}{2}$. This is non-zero as long as the electron is not stationary ($k=0$). The operator itself is not the zero operator. Therefore, this term is not identically $0$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nD. Nuclear–nuclear repulsion term, $V_{nn} = \\sum_{A<B}\\dfrac{Z_A Z_B}{\\lvert \\mathbf R_A - \\mathbf R_B \\rvert}$\nThis term gives the classical electrostatic repulsion energy between all unique pairs of nuclei. The indices $A$ and $B$ run over the set of nuclei, with the constraint $A < B$. The system contains no nuclei, so $N_A = 0$. To form a pair of nuclei requires at least two nuclei. As there are none, the sum is over an empty set of pairs. This empty sum is, by definition, $0$. Therefore, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion energy is identically zero: $V_{nn} = 0$.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nE. One-electron external potential term from classical fields, $V_{\\text{ext}} = \\sum_i v_{\\text{ext}}(\\mathbf r_i)$\nThis term accounts for the interaction of each electron with an external potential, such as one from a classical electric or magnetic field. The sum is over all electrons $i$. For a single electron ($N_e = 1$), this term simplifies to $V_{\\text{ext}} = v_{\\text{ext}}(\\mathbf r_1)$. The problem explicitly states that there are \"no applied external classical fields\". This is equivalent to stating that the potential function $v_{\\text{ext}}(\\mathbf{r})$ is zero for all $\\mathbf{r}$. Therefore, $V_{\\text{ext}}$ is identically $0$.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nIn summary, for a single, isolated electron in free space with no nuclei or external fields, the Hamiltonian consists only of the kinetic energy term. All potential energy terms ($V_{ee}$, $V_{en}$, and $V_{\\text{ext}}$) and the nuclear repulsion constant ($V_{nn}$) are identically zero.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABDE}$$", "id": "2465229"}, {"introduction": "The primary reason that the Schrödinger equation cannot be solved exactly for most atoms and molecules is the electron-electron repulsion term, $\\hat{V}_{ee}$.

According to the Slater-Condon rules, the matrix element of a one-body operator between such determinants is zero. The matrix element is therefore determined solely by the two-electron operator, $\\hat{g}$.\nFor determinants $|ab\\rangle$ and $|pq\\rangle$ that differ by two orbitals ($a \\rightarrow p, b \\rightarrow q$), the matrix element is $\\langle ab|\\hat{g}|pq\\rangle - \\langle ab|\\hat{g}|qp\\rangle$. Here, $a=\\psi_{g\\alpha}, b=\\psi_{g\\beta}, p=\\psi_{u\\alpha}, q=\\psi_{u\\beta}$.\n$$\nH_{gu} = \\langle\\psi_{g\\alpha}\\psi_{g\\beta}|\\hat{g}|\\psi_{u\\alpha}\\psi_{u\\beta}\\rangle - \\langle\\psi_{g\\alpha}\\psi_{g\\beta}|\\hat{g}|\\psi_{u\\beta}\\psi_{u\\alpha}\\rangle\n$$\nThe second term (the \"exchange-like\" term) involves spin integrals $\\langle\\alpha|\\beta\\rangle$ and $\\langle\\beta|\\alpha\\rangle$, which are both zero. So this term vanishes. The first term remains. The spin integration gives $\\langle\\alpha|\\alpha\\rangle\\langle\\beta|\\beta\\rangle = 1$. The remaining spatial integral is:\n$$\nI = \\iint \\phi_{g}(\\mathbf{r}_{1})\\phi_{g}(\\mathbf{r}_{2})\\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r}_{1}-\\mathbf{r}_{2}|}\\,\\phi_{u}(\\mathbf{r}_{1})\\phi_{u}(\\mathbf{r}_{2})\\,d\\mathbf{r}_{1}\\,d\\mathbf{r}_{2}\n$$\nNow we match this integral $I$ to the specific notation provided in the problem:\n$$\n(pq|rs)=\\iint \\phi_{p}(\\mathbf{r}_{1})\\phi_{q}(\\mathbf{r}_{2})\\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r}_{1}-\\mathbf{r}_{2}|}\\,\\phi_{r}(\\mathbf{r}_{1})\\phi_{s}(\\mathbf{r}_{2})\\,d\\mathbf{r}_{1}\\,d\\mathbf{r}_{2}\n$$\nBy setting $p=g, q=u, r=u, s=g$, we get:\n$$\n(gu|ug) = \\iint \\phi_{g}(\\mathbf{r}_{1})\\phi_{u}(\\mathbf{r}_{2})\\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r}_{1}-\\mathbf{r}_{2}|}\\,\\phi_{u}(\\mathbf{r}_{1})\\phi_{g}(\\mathbf{r}_{2})\\,d\\mathbf{r}_{1}\\,d\\mathbf{r}_{2}\n$$\nRearranging the functions in the integrand (which is allowed as they are scalar functions), this becomes:\n$$\n(gu|ug) = \\iint \\left[\\phi_{g}(\\mathbf{r}_{1})\\phi_{u}(\\mathbf{r}_{1})\\right] \\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r}_{1}-\\mathbf{r}_{2}|} \\left[\\phi_{u}(\\mathbf{r}_{2})\\phi_{g}(\\mathbf{r}_{2})\\right]\\,d\\mathbf{r}_{1}\\,d\\mathbf{r}_{2}\n$$\nThis is exactly the integral $I$ we derived from the first term of the Slater-Condon rule. Thus, $H_{gu} = (gu|ug)$.\n\n**Off-diagonal element $H_{ug} = \\langle\\Phi_{u}|\\hat{H}_{e}|\\Phi_{g}\\rangle$**:\nSince the Hamiltonian is Hermitian and the basis functions are real, the matrix representing $\\hat{H}_{e}$ must be symmetric. Thus, $H_{ug} = H_{gu}^* = H_{gu}$ because the integral $(gu|ug)$ is real.\n$$\nH_{ug} = (gu|ug)\n$$\nAssembling the $2 \\times 2$ matrix from these elements gives the final result.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2h_{gg} + (gg|gg) & (gu|ug) \\\\\n(gu|ug) & 2h_{uu} + (uu|uu)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2465206"}]}
