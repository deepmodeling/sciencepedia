Do not include any units.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is found to be scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It describes a standard, solvable problem in atomic physics. We will therefore proceed with a rigorous derivation of the solution.\n\nThe task is to determine the ground-state spin multiplicity of a neutral technetium atom. This requires first determining the ground-state term symbol, $ {}^{2S+1}L_{J} $, from which the spin multiplicity, $2S+1$, is directly obtained. The analysis is based on the electron configuration and the application of Hund's rules within the Russell-Saunders ($LS$) coupling scheme.\n\nFirst, we establish the electronic configuration of a neutral technetium atom. Technetium has an atomic number $Z=43$, which means a neutral atom possesses $43$ electrons. The electronic configuration is built upon the core of the preceding noble gas, Krypton ($\\text{Kr}$, $Z=36$). The remaining $43-36=7$ electrons must be placed in the available $5s$ and $4d$ orbitals. The ground-state electronic configuration for technetium is $[\\text{Kr}] \\, 4d^5 5s^2$.\n\nThe ground-state term symbol is determined by the electrons in open, partially filled subshells. The Krypton core, $[\\text{Kr}]$, consists of completely filled subshells. A completely filled subshell has a total orbital angular momentum $L=0$ and a total spin angular momentum $S=0$, contributing a term of $ {}^1S_0 $. Similarly, the $5s^2$ subshell is also completely filled, and it too contributes $L=0$ and $S=0$. Consequently, these filled subshells do not affect the total angular momentum quantum numbers of the atom, and we can disregard them for the purpose of finding the term symbol. The problem reduces to analyzing the configuration of the partially filled $4d^5$ subshell.\n\nFor the $4d^5$ subshell, the orbital angular momentum quantum number for a single $d$-electron is $l=2$. The magnetic quantum number $m_l$ can take values from $-l$ to $+l$, which are $m_l \\in \\{-2, -1, 0, +1, +2\\}$. There are $2l+1=5$ degenerate $d$-orbitals. We must place $5$ electrons into these $5$ orbitals according to Hund's rules.\n\nHund's First Rule: The state with the maximum total spin quantum number $S$ has the lowest energy. To maximize $S$, the electrons must occupy as many different orbitals as possible with their spins aligned in parallel. In the case of $4d^5$, we have $5$ electrons and $5$ orbitals. The Pauli exclusion principle permits placing one electron in each orbital. To maximize $S$, all five electrons must have parallel spins. We can represent this configuration as:\nOrbital ($m_l$):  $-2$ | $-1$ |  $0$ | $+1$ | $+2$\nSpin ($m_s$):  $\\uparrow$ | $\\uparrow$ | $\\uparrow$ | $\\uparrow$ | $\\uparrow$\nAssuming each spin-up electron has $m_s = +\\frac{1}{2}$, the total spin quantum number $S$ is the sum of the individual spin projections:\n$$S = \\sum m_s = 5 \\times \\left(+\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{5}{2}$$\nThe spin multiplicity is given by the formula $2S+1$. For this configuration, the spin multiplicity is:\n$$2S+1 = 2 \\left( \\frac{5}{2} \\right) + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6$$\n\nHund's Second Rule: For a given multiplicity, the state with the maximum total orbital angular momentum quantum number $L$ has the lowest energy. The value of $L$ is determined from the maximum possible value of the total magnetic quantum number $M_L = \\sum m_l$. For the configuration established by the first rule (one electron in each orbital), the sum of the $m_l$ values is:\n$$M_L = (-2) + (-1) + 0 + (+1) + (+2) = 0$$\nSince this is the only possible arrangement that maximizes $S$, the only possible value for $M_L$ is $0$. Therefore, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $L=0$. The spectroscopic letter corresponding to $L=0$ is $S$.\n\nHund's Third Rule: For a term with given $S$ and $L$, the ground state level is determined by the total angular momentum quantum number $J$. The possible values of $J$ range from $|L-S|$ to $L+S$ in integer steps. With $L=0$ and $S=\\frac{5}{2}$, the only possible value for $J$ is:\n$$J = \\left|0 - \\frac{5}{2}\\right| = \\frac{5}{2} \\quad \\text{to} \\quad 0+\\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{5}{2}$$\nThus, $J$ must be $\\frac{5}{2}$. The third rule states that for subshells that are less than half-filled, the level with minimum $J$ is lowest in energy, while for those more than half-filled, the level with maximum $J$ is lowest. For a precisely half-filled subshell, as is the case here ($4d^5$ in a $d$-shell that can hold $10$ electrons), there is only one possible $J$ value, so this rule is trivially satisfied.\n\nCombining these results, the ground-state term symbol $ {}^{2S+1}L_J $ for technetium is $ {}^6S_{5/2} $.\n\nThe problem explicitly asks for the spin multiplicity, which is the value of $2S+1$. Based on our calculation, this value is $6$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "2463349"}, {"introduction": "Beyond calculating ground states, a deep understanding of electronic structure involves correctly identifying and ordering excited states. This exercise [@problem_id:2463308] presents a common conceptual challenge regarding the first excited state of helium.

The description of the helium ground state configuration ($1s^2$) and its corresponding term symbol ($ {}^1S_0 $) is correct. The theoretical framework invoked—LS coupling, angular momentum addition, and the Pauli principle—are the standard and appropriate tools for determining the electronic states of light atoms. The question asks for a physical explanation for the ordering of excited states, which is a well-posed problem in atomic physics. The problem is self-contained, objective, and does not violate any fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. It is a standard textbook problem.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe ground electronic configuration of the helium atom is $1s^2$. The two electrons occupy the same spatial orbital ($n=1, l=0$). According to the Pauli exclusion principle, the total electronic wavefunction must be antisymmetric with respect to particle exchange. Since the spatial part of the wavefunction for two electrons in the same orbital is symmetric, the spin part must be antisymmetric. An antisymmetric two-electron spin function corresponds to a total spin quantum number $S=0$ (a singlet state). The total orbital angular momentum is $L = l_1+l_2 = 0+0=0$. The spin multiplicity is $2S+1 = 1$. The total angular momentum is $J = L+S=0$. This correctly yields the ground state term symbol $ {}^1S_0 $.\n\nThe first electronically excited state is formed by promoting one electron from the $1s$ orbital to the next available orbital of lowest energy. In any atom, for a given principal quantum number $n$, the energy of subshells increases with the orbital angular momentum quantum number $l$. Therefore, the $2s$ orbital is lower in energy than the $2p$ orbital. The lowest-energy promotion is $1s \\to 2s$, resulting in the excited configuration $1s^1 2s^1$.\n\nFor the $1s^1 2s^1$ configuration, the two electrons are in different spatial orbitals ($n_1=1$, $n_2=2$), so they are non-equivalent. The Pauli principle does not impose restrictions on the symmetry of the spin part of the wavefunction alone.\n\nWe determine the possible terms using LS coupling:\n1.  **Total Orbital Angular Momentum ($L$):** The electrons are in $s$-orbitals, so $l_1=0$ and $l_2=0$. The possible values for the total orbital angular momentum quantum number are given by $L = |l_1 - l_2|, \\dots, l_1 + l_2$. Thus, $L=0$. States with $L=0$ are designated as $S$ terms.\n2.  **Total Spin Angular Momentum ($S$):** Each electron has spin $s=1/2$. The possible values for the total spin quantum number are $S = |s_1 - s_2|, \\dots, s_1 + s_2$, which gives $S = |1/2 - 1/2|, \\dots, 1/2 + 1/2$. Thus, $S=0$ or $S=1$.\n    -   $S=0$ corresponds to a singlet state with multiplicity $2S+1 = 1$.\n    -   $S=1$ corresponds to a triplet state with multiplicity $2S+1 = 3$.\n\nCombining these results, the configuration $1s^1 2s^1$ gives rise to two terms:\n-   For $L=0$ and $S=0$: A $ {}^1S $ term. The total angular momentum is $J = |L-S| = 0$. The full term symbol is $ {}^1S_0 $.\n-   For $L=0$ and $S=1$: A $ {}^3S $ term. The total angular momentum is $J = |L-S| = 1$. The full term symbol is $ {}^3S_1 $.\n\nTo determine which of these states is the \"first\" excited state, we must determine their energy ordering. This is governed by Hund's rules for a given configuration:\n-   **Hund's First Rule:** The term with the maximum spin multiplicity lies lowest in energy.\n\nComparing the $ {}^1S_0 $ state (multiplicity $1$) and the $ {}^3S_1 $ state (multiplicity $3$), Hund's first rule dictates that the $ {}^3S_1 $ state is lower in energy. The physical basis for this rule is the exchange interaction. For the triplet state ($S=1$), the spin wavefunction is symmetric. By the Pauli principle, the spatial wavefunction must be antisymmetric. An antisymmetric spatial wavefunction implies that the probability of finding the two electrons close to each other is reduced, which in turn reduces their coulombic repulsion energy. This stabilization is not present for the singlet state ($S=0$), which has an antisymmetric spin wavefunction and a symmetric spatial wavefunction.\n\nTherefore, for the $1s^1 2s^1$ configuration, the energy ordering is $E({}^3S_1) < E({}^1S_0)$. The first electronically excited state of helium is the $ {}^3S_1 $ state, and the report claiming it is $ {}^1S_0 $ is incorrect.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Promoting one electron from $1s$ to $2s$ gives the open-shell configuration $1s\\,2s$ with possible total spins $S=0$ and $S=1$ and total orbital angular momentum $L=0$. The antisymmetric spatial (symmetric spin) combination is exchange-stabilized, so the triplet $^3S_1$ lies below the singlet $^1S_0$; therefore the first excited state is $^3S_1$, not $^1S_0$.**\nThis statement is a complete and correct exposition of the reasoning. It correctly identifies the lowest-energy promotion to $1s^1 2s^1$, correctly derives the possible $L$ and $S$ values, and correctly applies Hund's first rule and its underlying physical justification (exchange stabilization associated with the symmetric spin/antisymmetric spatial wavefunction of the triplet state) to establish that $ {}^3S_1 $ is lower in energy than $ {}^1S_0 $.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The Pauli exclusion principle forbids a singlet $^1S_0$ term for the $1s\\,2s$ configuration because the electrons have the same orbital angular momentum $l=0$; only triplet states are allowed.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The Pauli exclusion principle applies to equivalent electrons (those with the same $n$ and $l$ quantum numbers). For the $1s^1 2s^1$ configuration, the electrons are non-equivalent because their principal quantum numbers differ ($n_1=1, n_2=2$). Therefore, both singlet ($S=0$) and triplet ($S=1$) spin combinations are allowed. The term $ {}^1S_0 $ is a valid, existing state for this configuration. The premise of the argument is flawed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The lowest-energy promotion must be $1s \\rightarrow 2p$, which necessarily yields a $P$ term with $L=1$, so the first excited term must be $^1P_1$ rather than $^1S_0$ by conservation of angular momentum.**\nThis statement is incorrect for two primary reasons. First, it incorrectly identifies the lowest-energy promotion. Due to shielding and penetration effects, the $2s$ orbital is lower in energy than the $2p$ orbital in a multi-electron atom like helium. The lowest-energy promotion is $1s \\to 2s$. Second, the \"conservation of angular momentum\" is misapplied. This phrase typically refers to selection rules for spectroscopic transitions, but the question concerns the ordering of stationary energy levels, not the dynamics of transitions. While the $ {}^1S_0 \\to {}^1P_1 $ transition is optically allowed and the $ {}^1S_0 \\to {}^3S_1 $ or $ {}^1S_0 \\to {}^1S_0 $ transitions are forbidden, this does not alter the fact that the $ {}^3S_1 $ state has the lowest energy among all excited states.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Because the ground state has $J=0$, selection rules require any excited state to have $J\\neq 0$, which forbids an excited $^1S_0$ term from existing; therefore the report is incorrect for that reason.**\nThis statement fundamentally misinterprets the meaning of selection rules. Selection rules govern the probability of transitions between quantum states (e.g., via absorption or emission of a photon); they do not forbid the existence of the states themselves. The $J=0 \\to J=0$ transition is indeed forbidden for single-photon processes. However, the excited $ {}^1S_0 $ state is a perfectly valid eigenstate of the helium atom's Hamiltonian. Its existence is independent of how it might be populated from the ground state. The argument that the state is \"forbidden from existing\" is a logical fallacy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2463308"}, {"introduction": "The fundamental principles governing term symbols are not confined to isolated atoms; they extend to molecules as well.

It is therefore deemed valid. The solution proceeds as follows.\n\nThe system under consideration is the dinitrogen cation, $\\text{N}_{2}^{+}$. A neutral nitrogen atom, $N$, has an atomic number $Z=7$ and thus possesses $7$ electrons. The neutral homonuclear diatomic molecule, $\\text{N}_{2}$, therefore contains $2 \\times 7 = 14$ electrons. The cation, $\\text{N}_{2}^{+}$, is formed by the removal of one electron, resulting in a total of $13$ electrons.\n\nThe problem specifies the molecular orbital (MO) energy level ordering for homonuclear diatomics with $Z \\leq 7$, which is:\n$$1\\sigma_{g} < 1\\sigma_{u} < 2\\sigma_{g} < 2\\sigma_{u} < 1\\pi_{u} < 3\\sigma_{g} < 1\\pi_{g}^{*} < 3\\sigma_{u}^{*}$$\nWe must populate these orbitals with the $13$ electrons of $\\text{N}_{2}^{+}$ according to the Aufbau principle and the Pauli exclusion principle.

All fully occupied subshells, such as $(\\sigma)^{2}$ and $(\\pi)^{4}$, are closed shells. A closed shell is spherically or cylindrically symmetric and has a total orbital angular momentum projection $\\Lambda=0$ and a total spin angular momentum $S=0$. Consequently, they do not contribute to the final term symbol, which is determined solely by the single electron in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), the $3\\sigma_{g}$ orbital.\n\nWe now determine each component of the term symbol for the $(3\\sigma_{g})^{1}$ configuration.\n\n1.  **Total orbital angular momentum projection, $\\Lambda$**:\n    The quantum number $\\Lambda$ is the absolute value of the sum of the individual projections of orbital angular momentum, $m_{\\lambda}$, onto the internuclear axis: $\\Lambda = |\\sum_{i} m_{\\lambda_{i}}|$. For a single electron in a $\\sigma$ orbital, by definition, $m_{\\lambda}=0$. Therefore, the total $\\Lambda$ is:\n    $$\\Lambda = |0| = 0$$\n    A value of $\\Lambda=0$ corresponds to a $\\Sigma$ state.\n\n2.  **Total spin angular momentum, $S$, and spin multiplicity, $2S+1$**:\n    The total spin quantum number $S$ is the sum of the spin quantum numbers of the unpaired electrons. There is only one electron in the open shell, which has a spin of $s = 1/2$. Thus, the total spin is:\n    $$S = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n    The spin multiplicity is given by the formula $2S+1$. Substituting the value of $S$:\n    $$2S+1 = 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$$\n    This is a doublet state.\n\n3.  **Parity, $\\mathrm{g/u}$**:\n    The overall parity of the electronic state is determined by the product of the parities of the individual occupied orbitals. For any fully occupied orbital (e.g., $(1\\pi_{u})^{4}$), the total parity is always gerade ($g$), as $u \\times u \\times u \\times u = (u \\times u) \\times (u \\times u) = g \\times g = g$. Therefore, the overall parity is determined solely by the parity of the singly occupied orbital. The unpaired electron resides in the $3\\sigma_{g}$ orbital, which has gerade symmetry. Thus, the overall state parity is $g$.\n\n4.  **Reflection symmetry, $\\pm$**:\n    This superscript applies only to $\\Sigma$ states. It describes the symmetry of the total electronic wavefunction upon reflection through an arbitrary plane containing the internuclear axis. For a state arising from a single electron in a $\\sigma$ orbital, the wavefunction is, by definition of a $\\sigma$ orbital, cylindrically symmetric and does not change sign upon such a reflection. This corresponds to a '$+$' symmetry.\n\nCombining these components, the full ground-state term symbol for $\\text{N}_{2}^{+}$ is $ {}^2\\Sigma_g^+ $.\n\nThe problem asks whether the state is paramagnetic or diamagnetic. Paramagnetism arises from the presence of one or more unpaired electrons, whereas diamagnetism corresponds to a state where all electrons are paired. Since the $\\text{N}_{2}^{+}$ cation has one unpaired electron ($S=1/2$), it possesses a net magnetic moment and is therefore paramagnetic.\n\nThe final question asks for the spin multiplicity, $2S+1$, which we have calculated to be $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2463329"}]}
