Since atomic orbitals can be chosen to be real, $(\\psi_{1s}^A)^* = \\psi_{1s}^A$. This function depends on $x^2$, $y^2$, and $z^2$. If we change the sign of $x$ to $-x$, the value of the function remains unchanged:\n$\\psi_{1s}^A(-x, y, z) = \\exp(-\\sqrt{(-x)^2+y^2+z^2}) = \\exp(-\\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}) = \\psi_{1s}^A(x, y, z)$.\nTherefore, the $1s$ orbital is an **even** function with respect to the variable $x$.\n\nThe $2p_x$ orbital on atom B is given by $\\psi_{2p_x}^B \\propto x \\cdot \\exp(-r_B/2) = x \\cdot \\exp(-\\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(z-R)^2}/2)$.

Its symmetry with respect to $x$ is the product of the symmetries of its factors:\n$I(-x, y, z) = \\psi_{1s}^A(-x,y,z) \\cdot \\psi_{2p_x}^B(-x,y,z) = (\\text{even function}) \\cdot (\\text{odd function}) = (\\psi_{1s}^A) \\cdot (-\\psi_{2p_x}^B) = -I(x,y,z)$.\nThe integrand $I(x,y,z)$ is an **odd** function with respect to the variable $x$.\n\nThe integral can be separated as:\n$$S_{AB} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} I(x,y,z) \\, dx \\right] \\, dy \\, dz$$\nWe focus on the innermost integral over $x$. A fundamental theorem of calculus states that the integral of an odd function $f(x)$ over a symmetric interval $[-a, a]$ is zero: $\\int_{-a}^{a} f(x) \\, dx = 0$. Here, our integration domain for $x$ is $(-\\infty, \\infty)$, which is symmetric about $x=0$.\nSince the integrand $I(x,y,z)$ is odd with respect to $x$, the integral over $x$ for any given $y$ and $z$ is zero:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} I(x,y,z) \\, dx = 0 $$\nBecause this inner integral is zero for all values of $y$ and $z$, the entire triple integral $S_{AB}$ must be zero.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\nA. This is incorrect. Different principal quantum numbers do not guarantee zero overlap. For example, the overlap between a $1s$ and a $2s$ orbital is non-zero. The energy difference affects the magnitude of the stabilization energy, not the geometric overlap itself.\nB. This statement is conceptually true but is not the rigorous mathematical reason. It describes the physical consequence of the mathematical property, but it doesn't state the property itself. The \"cancellation\" is a result of integrating an odd function.\nC. This is the correct and precise mathematical explanation. The integrand is an odd function of $x$, and the integration domain $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ is symmetric with respect to $x=0$. This directly leads to the integral being zero.\nD. This is incorrect. Orthogonality of radial functions is only guaranteed for orbitals on the *same* atom if they have different principal quantum numbers but the same angular momentum quantum number. Here, the orbitals are on different atoms, so their radial parts are not generally orthogonal.\nE. This statement uses molecular orbital theory terminology. The interaction between a $s$ orbital and a $p_x$ orbital (where the z-axis is the internuclear axis) is indeed a $\\pi$-type interaction due to the nodal plane of the $p_x$ orbital containing the internuclear axis. While it's true that such interactions lead to zero overlap in this specific orientation, statement C provides the more fundamental mathematical reason *why* this symmetry leads to a zero integral.
