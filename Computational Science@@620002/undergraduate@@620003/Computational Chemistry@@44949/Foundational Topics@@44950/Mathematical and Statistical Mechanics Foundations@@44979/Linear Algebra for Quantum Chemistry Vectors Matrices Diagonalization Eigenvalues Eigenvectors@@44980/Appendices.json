An elegant method is to use a rotation matrix that diagonalizes $\\mathbf{H}$. The eigenvectors are the columns of this rotation matrix. The angle of rotation, $\\theta$, is determined by the condition that the off-diagonal elements of the rotated Hamiltonian become zero. This condition leads to the relation:\n$$\n\\tan(2\\theta) = \\frac{2V}{E_{D} - E_{A}}\n$$\nUsing the provided values:\n$$\n\\tan(2\\theta) = \\frac{2(-0.40)}{-7.50 - (-6.80)} = \\frac{-0.80}{-0.70} = \\frac{8}{7}\n$$\nThe sign of $E_D - E_A$ is negative, and since $\\tan(2\\theta)$ is positive, we can deduce which eigenvalue corresponds to which eigenvector. The two eigenvalues resulting from the diagonalization by rotation are $E_1 = E_{D}\\cos^2\\theta + E_{A}\\sin^2\\theta + 2V\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta$ and $E_2 = E_{D}\\sin^2\\theta + E_{A}\\cos^2\\theta - 2V\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta$.

Since $E_D - E_A < 0$ and $\\tan(2\\theta) > 0$ (implying we can choose $2\\theta$ in the first quadrant where $\\cos(2\\theta) > 0$), we have $E_1 - E_2 < 0$, so $E_1 = E_{-}$.\n\nThe eigenvector corresponding to the lower energy $E_{-}$ is the first column of the rotation matrix, which is $\\mathbf{c}_{-} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$.

This requires determining the action of $\\hat{R}(C_{2})$ on each basis vector.\n\nThe operator $\\hat{R}(C_{2})$ rotates the entire spatial configuration by $\\pi$ radians. The problem states that this rotation exchanges the positions of the hydrogen nuclei $\\mathrm{H_A}$ and $\\mathrm{H_B}$. The basis functions, $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$, are scalar functions (atomic orbitals) centered at these nuclear positions. The action of a spatial transformation operator on a scalar function is to transform its argument. Specifically, $(\\hat{R}\\psi)(\\vec{r}) = \\psi(\\hat{R}^{-1}\\vec{r})$.

Because the $1s$ orbital is spherically symmetric, its functional form is unchanged by rotation about its center. The operation merely translates the center of the orbital from $\\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{A}}$ to $\\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{B}}$. The resulting function is thus identical to the basis function centered at $\\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{B}}$, which is $\\psi_2 = |1s_{\\mathrm{B}}\\rangle$.\n\nTherefore, the action of the operator on the first basis vector is:\n$$ \\hat{R}(C_{2}) |1s_{\\mathrm{A}}\\rangle = |1s_{\\mathrm{B}}\\rangle $$\nIn terms of our basis vector notation:\n$$ \\hat{R}(C_{2}) \\psi_1 = \\psi_2 $$\nSimilarly, applying the operator to $\\psi_2 = |1s_{\\mathrm{B}}\\rangle$ moves its center from $\\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{B}}$ to $\\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{A}}$.
