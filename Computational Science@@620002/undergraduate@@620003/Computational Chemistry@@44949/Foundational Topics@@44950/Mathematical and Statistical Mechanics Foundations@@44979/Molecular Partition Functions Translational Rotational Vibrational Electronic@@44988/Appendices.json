The vibrational quantum number $v$ runs from $0$ up to a maximum value, $v_{\\mathrm{max}}$. This maximum occurs just before the energy spacing between adjacent levels becomes zero or negative. The energy spacing is $\\Delta E_v = E_{v+1} - E_v$. The derivative of $E_v$ with respect to $v$ becoming zero marks the turnover point of the energy levels.\n$$\n\\frac{dE_{v}^{\\mathrm{Morse}}}{dv} = \\hbar\\omega_{e} - 2\\left(v + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\hbar\\omega_{e}x_{e} = 0\n$$\nSolving for $v$ yields $v_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{1}{2x_{e}} - \\frac{1}{2}$. The largest integer quantum number for a bound state is $v_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\lfloor v_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\rfloor$. Using the relation for $x_e$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2x_{e}} = \\frac{2 D_{e}}{\\hbar\\omega_{e}} \\implies v_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2 D_{e}}{\\hbar\\omega_{e}} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right\\rfloor\n$$\nThe partition function is then a finite sum over all bound states from $v=0$ to $v_{\\mathrm{max}}$:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{vib}}^{\\mathrm{Morse}} = \\sum_{v=0}^{v_{\\mathrm{max}}} e^{-\\beta E_{v}^{\\mathrm{Morse}}} = \\sum_{v=0}^{v_{\\mathrm{max}}} \\exp\\left[-\\beta \\left( \\left(v + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\hbar\\omega_{e} - \\left(v + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\frac{(\\hbar\\omega_{e})^2}{4 D_{e}} \\right)\\right]\n$$\nThis sum must be evaluated numerically.\n\n**3. Computational Procedure**\n\nFor each test case $(\\tilde{\\nu}_{e}, D_{e}, T)$:\n1. Define the physical constants: $h, c, k_{\\mathrm{B}}, N_{\\mathrm{A}}$.\n2. Convert inputs to SI units:\n   - $\\tilde{\\nu}_{e, \\mathrm{m}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{e} \\times 100$\n   - $D_{e, \\mathrm{J}} = (D_{e, \\mathrm{kJ/mol}} \\times 1000) / N_{\\mathrm{A}}$\n3. Calculate fundamental parameters:\n   - $\\beta = 1 / (k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)$\n   - $\\hbar\\omega_{e} = h \\times c \\times \\tilde{\\nu}_{e, \\mathrm{m}}$\n4. Calculate $q_{\\mathrm{vib}}^{\\mathrm{Harmonic}}$:\n   - $x = \\beta \\times \\hbar\\omega_{e}$\n   - $q_{\\mathrm{vib}}^{\\mathrm{Harmonic}} = 1 / (2 \\times \\sinh(x/2))$\n5. Calculate $q_{\\mathrm{vib}}^{\\mathrm{Morse}}$:\n   - Determine $v_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\lfloor (2 \\times D_{e, \\mathrm{J}} / \\hbar\\omega_{e}) - 0.5 \\rfloor$.\n   - Initialize $q_{\\mathrm{vib}}^{\\mathrm{Morse}} = 0$.\n   - Loop for $v$ from $0$ to $v_{\\mathrm{max}}$:\n     -  Calculate $E_{v}^{\\mathrm{Morse}} = (v+0.5)\\hbar\\omega_{e} - (v+0.5)^2 (\\hbar\\omega_{e})^2 / (4 D_{e, \\mathrm{J}})$.\n     -  Add $e^{-\\beta E_{v}^{\\mathrm{Morse}}}$ to the sum.\n6. Compute the ratio $R = q_{\\mathrm{vib}}^{\\mathrm{Morse}} / q_{\\mathrm{vib}}^{\\mathrm{Harmonic}}$.\n7. Store and format the result to 8 decimal places.\nThe final output will be a list of these ratios for all test cases.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the ratio of Morse to Harmonic vibrational partition functions.\n    The derivation and implementation follow first principles of statistical mechanics.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Physical Constants in SI units\n    H_PLANCK = 6.62607015e-34  # J*s\n    C_LIGHT = 299792458.0      # m/s\n    K_BOLTZMANN = 1.380649e-23   # J/K\n    N_AVOGADRO = 6.02214076e23  # mol^-1\n    HBAR = H_PLANCK / (2 * np.pi)\n\n    # Test cases: (nu_e_cm^-1, De_kJ/mol, T_K)\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A: general, stiff bond, moderate temperature\n        (2169.813, 1076.0, 1000.0),\n        # Case B: low temperature limit\n        (2169.813, 1076.0, 50.0),\n        # Case C: high temperature\n        (2169.813, 1076.0, 8000.0),\n        # Case D: shallower well, lower frequency, room temperature\n        (500.0, 50.0, 300.0),\n        # Case E: very shallow well, strong anharmonicity\n        (1000.0, 10.0, 1000.0),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for nu_e_cm, de_kj_mol, temp_k in test_cases:\n        # Step 1: Unit Conversions to SI\n        # Convert wavenumber from cm^-1 to m^-1\n        nu_e_m = nu_e_cm * 100.0\n        # Convert dissociation energy from kJ/mol to J/molecule\n        de_j = (de_kj_mol * 1000.0) / N_AVOGADRO\n\n        # Step 2: Calculate fundamental parameters\n        # Beta factor\n        beta = 1.0 / (K_BOLTZMANN * temp_k)\n        # Vibrational energy quantum\n        hbar_omega_e = H_PLANCK * C_LIGHT * nu_e_m\n\n        # Step 3: Calculate Harmonic Oscillator Partition Function\n        # Using the formula q = 1 / (2*sinh(beta*hbar*omega/2))\n        x_ho = beta * hbar_omega_e\n        q_harmonic = 1.0 / (2.0 * np.sinh(x_ho / 2.0))\n\n        # Step 4: Calculate Morse Oscillator Partition Function\n        # Determine the maximum bound vibrational quantum number, v_max\n        # v_max = floor(2*De / (hbar*omega_e) - 0.5)\n        v_max_float = (2.0 * de_j / hbar_omega_e) - 0.5\n        # Ensure v_max is not negative if the well is extremely shallow\n        if v_max_float < 0:\n            v_max = -1 # this will result in an empty sum, q_morse = 0\n        else:\n            v_max = int(np.floor(v_max_float))\n\n        # Numerically sum over all bound states for the Morse oscillator\n        q_morse = 0.0\n        \n        # Pre-calculate a term for efficiency\n        anharmonic_term_factor = (hbar_omega_e**2) / (4.0 * de_j)\n\n        for v in range(v_max + 1):\n            v_plus_half = v + 0.5\n            energy_morse = v_plus_half * hbar_omega_e - (v_plus_half**2) * anharmonic_term_factor\n            q_morse += np.exp(-beta * energy_morse)\n\n        # Step 5: Calculate the ratio R\n        if q_harmonic == 0:\n             # This case is physically unlikely unless T=0, but handle for safety.\n            ratio = np.inf if q_morse > 0 else 0.0\n        else:\n            ratio = q_morse / q_harmonic\n        \n        results.append(f\"{ratio:.8f}\")\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```", "id": "2458704"}]}
