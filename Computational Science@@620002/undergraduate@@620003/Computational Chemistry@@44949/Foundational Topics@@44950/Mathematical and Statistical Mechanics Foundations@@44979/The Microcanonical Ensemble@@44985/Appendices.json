Consider running a classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in the microcanonical (number of particles, volume, energy) (NVE) ensemble, i.e., with fixed $N$, $V$, and $E$, starting from a set of initial conditions that assign different amounts of energy to different vibrational normal modes.

Instead, they remain unequal and reflect their initial values.\n- **Question**: To provide a first-principles explanation for why the equipartition theorem is not observed in this simulation.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem describes a classical harmonic solid, a fundamental model in physics. The concepts of normal modes, the microcanonical ensemble, and the equipartition theorem are cornerstones of classical and statistical mechanics. The observed failure of equipartition in a purely harmonic (integrable) system is a well-established result in the study of ergodicity. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides a completely defined theoretical system (classical harmonic solid), a specific simulation context ($NVE$ MD), clear initial conditions, a precise observation, and a direct question for a physical explanation. It is a well-posed problem.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The provided information is sufficient and self-consistent. The observation (lack of energy redistribution) is the phenomenon to be explained, not a contradiction. The premise of a \"purely quadratic\" potential is the key constraint that dictates the dynamics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It presents a standard, albeit subtle, question regarding the foundations of statistical mechanics. The derivation of the solution can now proceed.\n\n**Principle-Based Derivation**\nThe Hamiltonian for a solid, in terms of atomic displacements from equilibrium positions $\\mathbf{q}$ and conjugate momenta $\\mathbf{p}$, is $H = K(\\mathbf{p}) + U(\\mathbf{q})$. The problem states the potential energy $U(\\mathbf{q})$ is a purely quadratic function of the displacements. This is the definition of a harmonic system.\n\nFor any system with a quadratic potential energy, it is possible to perform a linear canonical transformation from the atomic coordinates $(\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{p})$ to a new set of coordinates and momenta known as normal modes, $(Q_k, P_k)$. In terms of these normal modes, the Hamiltonian for the harmonic solid separates into a sum of independent terms, one for each mode:\n$$H = \\sum_{k=1}^{3N-6} H_k(Q_k, P_k) = \\sum_{k=1}^{3N-6} \\left( \\frac{P_k^2}{2\\mu_k} + \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_k \\omega_k^2 Q_k^2 \\right)$$\nHere, $k$ indexes the normal modes (excluding translations and rotations), $\\omega_k$ is the frequency of the $k$-th mode, and $\\mu_k$ is its reduced mass. Each term $H_k$ is the Hamiltonian of an independent harmonic oscillator.\n\nThe crucial consequence of this separability is that the energy of each individual normal mode, $E_k = H_k$, is a constant of motion. This can be shown using Hamilton's equations. The time derivative of $H_k$ is:\n$$\\frac{dH_k}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial H_k}{\\partial Q_k}\\dot{Q}_k + \\frac{\\partial H_k}{\\partial P_k}\\dot{P}_k$$\nFrom Hamilton's equations for the total Hamiltonian $H$: $\\dot{Q}_k = \\partial H / \\partial P_k$ and $\\dot{P}_k = -\\partial H / \\partial Q_k$. Since $H$ is a sum of $H_j$ and each $H_j$ only depends on $(Q_j, P_j)$, we have $\\partial H / \\partial P_k = \\partial H_k / \\partial P_k$ and $\\partial H / \\partial Q_k = \\partial H_k / \\partial Q_k$. Substituting these into the time derivative gives:\n$$\\frac{dH_k}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial H_k}{\\partial Q_k}\\left(\\frac{\\partial H_k}{\\partial P_k}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial H_k}{\\partial P_k}\\left(-\\frac{\\partial H_k}{\\partial Q_k}\\right) = 0$$\nThus, the energy $E_k$ of each normal mode is individually conserved.\n\nThe equipartition theorem is a result of statistical mechanics, which applies to systems in thermal equilibrium. A fundamental precondition for a system to reach thermal equilibrium from an arbitrary initial state is that it must be ergodic. Ergodicity implies that a system's trajectory in phase space, over a long time, explores the entire constant-energy-hypersurface defined by $E = \\text{const}$.\n\nIn our purely harmonic system, the dynamics are constrained not only by the conservation of total energy, $E = \\sum_k E_k$, but also by the conservation of each individual modal energy, $E_k = \\text{const}$ for all $k$. This means a trajectory is confined to a much smaller subspace (a torus in phase space) defined by the initial set of modal energies $\\{E_k\\}$. The system cannot explore other parts of the constant-$E$ hypersurface that have a different partitioning of energy among the modes. Such a system is called **integrable** and is fundamentally **non-ergodic**.\n\nSince energy cannot be exchanged between the normal modes, an initial non-equilibrium distribution of energy will persist indefinitely. The time-averaged kinetic energy of each mode, $\\langle K_k \\rangle_t$, will simply be half of its fixed total energy, $\\langle K_k \\rangle_t = \\frac{1}{2} E_k$. If the initial $E_k$ values are unequal, the time-averaged kinetic energies will also remain unequal. The system never reaches the microcanonical equilibrium state, and consequently, the equipartition of energy does not occur. The physical mechanism for energy exchange in real solids—anharmonic terms in the potential—is explicitly absent in this idealized model.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. In a purely harmonic solid, the Hamiltonian separates into a sum of independent quadratic normal modes whose individual energies are constants of motion; at very low $E$ the absence of anharmonic coupling renders the dynamics integrable and non-ergodic, so energy cannot redistribute among modes and equipartition fails to emerge.**\nThis statement is a complete and accurate summary of the derivation above. It correctly identifies the separability of the Hamiltonian, the conservation of individual modal energies, the resulting integrability and non-ergodicity of the dynamics, and the consequent failure of energy redistribution, which is the reason for the breakdown of equipartition. The mention of \"very low $E$\" is consistent with the problem statement, as it ensures that any latent anharmonicity present in a real system is not accessed, thus keeping the dynamics purely harmonic.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. At very low energy, quantum zero-point effects freeze out high-frequency vibrations, so classical equipartition cannot hold in NVE.**\nThis explanation invokes quantum mechanics. The problem explicitly specifies a **classical molecular dynamics (MD)** simulation, which obeys classical mechanics. Quantum effects such as zero-point energy and energy quantization are not part of this model. The observed failure of equipartition has a purely classical explanation related to the dynamics of the model itself. While quantum freeze-out is a real phenomenon that causes deviations from classical equipartition in real materials at low temperatures, it is not the explanation for the behavior seen in this specified classical simulation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. In the NVE ensemble the kinetic energy $K$ is exactly constant in time, which prevents exchanges of energy among modes and thus precludes equipartition.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. In the microcanonical ($NVE$) ensemble, the *total* energy $E = K + U$ is conserved, not the kinetic energy $K$ or the potential energy $U$ individually. Energy is continuously exchanged between kinetic and potential forms as the particles oscillate. The total kinetic energy $K(t)$ is\na fluctuating quantity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The microcanonical probability measure on the constant-energy hypersurface assigns zero probability to states with unequal modal energies, so the system cannot reach equipartition starting from unequal initial conditions.**\nThis misrepresents the microcanonical ensemble. The fundamental postulate of this ensemble is that *all accessible microstates* on the constant-energy hypersurface are equally probable. A state with unequal energies in modes is a valid point on this surface. The issue is not that such states have zero probability in the ensemble measure, but that the system's **dynamics** are non-ergodic and cannot access the vast majority of the states on the surface. The trajectory is trapped. The explanation lies in the dynamics, not in an incorrectly stated property of the statistical measure.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Because no thermostat is present in NVE, equipartition cannot occur; a thermostat is strictly necessary for energy to flow among degrees of freedom.**\nThis is a misconception. A thermostat is an algorithm in a simulation to mimic a heat bath (e.g., for an $NVT$ simulation). An isolated ($NVE$) system can and will achieve internal thermal equilibrium and equipartition on its own, provided it is ergodic. The mechanism for internal energy flow is the coupling between degrees of freedom (i.e., anharmonicity in the potential), which leads to chaotic dynamics. A thermostat is not a physically necessary condition for equipartition to arise from internal dynamics.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2465299"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theory to practice, implementing the microcanonical ensemble computationally is done via $NVE$ (constant Number, Volume, and Energy) molecular dynamics simulations.
