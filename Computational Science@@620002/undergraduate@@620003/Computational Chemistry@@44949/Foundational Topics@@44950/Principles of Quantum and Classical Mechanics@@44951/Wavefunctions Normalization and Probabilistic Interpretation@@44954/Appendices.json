It is a standard, well-posed problem in quantum mechanics, requiring the normalization of a given wavefunction.\n\nThe probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics, specifically the Born rule, dictates that the probability density of finding a particle at a position $x$ is given by the modulus squared of its wavefunction, $|\\psi(x)|^2$. For the particle to exist, the total probability of finding it somewhere in the entire allowed domain must be equal to $1$. This is the normalization condition. For the given one-dimensional wavefunction $\\psi(x)$ on the domain $x \\in [0, \\infty)$, this condition is expressed as:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |\\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1 $$\nThe wavefunction is given as $\\psi(x) = N x \\exp(-ax)$, where $N$ is the normalization constant, $a$ is a positive real constant ($a>0$), and $x$ is the position coordinate. We substitute this expression into the normalization integral:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |N x \\exp(-ax)|^2 dx = 1 $$\nThe modulus squared term can be separated. Since $N$ may be a complex number, we write $|N|^2$. The variable $x$ is real and non-negative in the domain of integration, so $|x|^2 = x^2$. The constant $a$ is also real, making the exponential term $\\exp(-ax)$ real. Therefore, $|\\exp(-ax)|^2 = (\\exp(-ax))^2 = \\exp(-2ax)$. The normalization equation simplifies to:\n$$ |N|^2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x^2 \\exp(-2ax) dx = 1 $$\nTo proceed, we must evaluate the definite integral. This integral is a specific case of the general formula related to the Gamma function:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^n \\exp(-ct) dt = \\frac{n!}{c^{n+1}} $$\nwhich is valid for any integer $n \\ge 0$ and any real constant $c > 0$. In our problem, we identify the variable of integration as $t=x$, the power as $n=2$, and the constant in the exponent as $c=2a$. Since it is given that $a>0$, the condition $c>0$ is satisfied. Applying the formula yields:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x^2 \\exp(-2ax) dx = \\frac{2!}{(2a)^{2+1}} = \\frac{2}{(2a)^3} = \\frac{2}{8a^3} = \\frac{1}{4a^3} $$\nNow, we substitute this result back into the normalization equation:\n$$ |N|^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{4a^3} \\right) = 1 $$\nSolving for $|N|^2$, we find:\n$$ |N|^2 = 4a^3 $$\nThis gives the magnitude of the normalization constant:\n$$ |N| = \\sqrt{4a^3} = 2\\sqrt{a^3} = 2a^{3/2} $$\nThe normalization constant $N$ can be any complex number with this magnitude, i.e., $N = 2a^{3/2} \\exp(i\\phi)$ for an arbitrary real phase $\\phi$. However, it is a common and established convention in quantum mechanics to choose the normalization constant to be a real, positive number, as the overall phase of the wavefunction is physically unobservable. Following this convention, we set $\\phi=0$ and obtain the final expression for $N$.\n$$ N = 2a^{3/2} $$\nThis value of $N$ ensures that the total probability of finding the particle along the reaction coordinate from $x=0$ to $x=\\infty$ is exactly $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2a^{3/2}}$$", "id": "2467238"}, {"introduction": "Once a wavefunction is normalized, it becomes a powerful predictive tool.

It is a well-posed problem grounded in the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the probabilistic interpretation of the wavefunction for the hydrogen atom. The formulation is objective, self-contained, and computationally feasible. The task is to construct a Monte Carlo sampler for the ground-state electron distribution and compute specified statistical diagnostics.\n\nThe scientific basis for the solution is the Born interpretation, which states that the probability of finding a particle in a small volume element $dV$ at position $\\vec{x}$ is given by $|\\psi(\\vec{x})|^2 dV$. For the hydrogenic $1s$ orbital, the wavefunction $\\psi_{1s}(r)$ depends only on the radial distance $r = |\\vec{x}|$. The wavefunction is given as:\n$$\n\\psi_{1s}(r) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi} a_0^{3/2}} e^{-r/a_0}\n$$\nwhere $a_0$ is the Bohr radius. The probability density in three-dimensional space is therefore:\n$$\n|\\psi_{1s}(r)|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\pi a_0^3} e^{-2r/a_0}\n$$\nTo devise a sampling algorithm, we express the volume element $dV$ in spherical coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$ as $dV = r^2 \\sin\\theta dr d\\theta d\\phi$. The joint probability density for these coordinates is:\n$$\nP(r, \\theta, \\phi) dr d\\theta d\\phi = |\\psi_{1s}(r)|^2 dV = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\pi a_0^3} e^{-2r/a_0}\\right) r^2 \\sin\\theta dr d\\theta d\\phi\n$$\nThis expression is separable into radial and angular components. The distribution is uniform with respect to the azimuthal angle $\\phi$ over $[0, 2\\pi]$ and is proportional to $\\sin\\theta$ for the polar angle $\\theta$ over $[0, \\pi]$. These correspond to an isotropic distribution of directions in space. The required diagnostics, however, depend only on the radial distance $r$. Therefore, we can integrate out the angular dependence to find the marginal probability distribution for the radius $r$, denoted $P(r)$:\n$$\nP(r) dr = \\left( \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_0^\\pi \\sin\\theta d\\theta \\right) \\frac{1}{\\pi a_0^3} r^2 e^{-2r/a_0} dr\n$$\nThe angular integral evaluates to $(2\\pi)(2) = 4\\pi$.

Consequently, $r = \\rho a_0$ and $dr = a_0 d\\rho$. Substituting these into the radial distribution function yields the probability distribution for $\\rho$:\n$$\nP(\\rho) d\\rho = \\frac{4}{a_0^3} (\\rho a_0)^2 e^{-2(\\rho a_0)/a_0} (a_0 d\\rho) = 4 \\rho^2 e^{-2\\rho} d\\rho\n$$\nThis probability density function for the dimensionless radius $\\rho$, $P(\\rho) = 4\\rho^2 e^{-2\\rho}$, is independent of the Bohr radius $a_0$. Therefore, the value of $a_0$ given in the test cases is not required for the calculation of the requested dimensionless diagnostics.\n\nThe core of the algorithm is to generate random samples from the distribution $P(\\rho)$. This distribution is a specific instance of the Gamma distribution. The probability density function of a Gamma distribution with shape parameter $k$ and scale parameter $\\theta$ is given by:\n$$\nf(x; k, \\theta) = \\frac{x^{k-1} e^{-x/\\theta}}{\\theta^k \\Gamma(k)}\n$$\nwhere $\\Gamma(k)$ is the Gamma function. For our distribution $P(\\rho) = 4\\rho^2 e^{-2\\rho}$, we can identify $k-1=2 \\implies k=3$ and $1/\\theta=2 \\implies \\theta=1/2$. The normalization constant is $\\frac{1}{(1/2)^3 \\Gamma(3)} = \\frac{1}{(1/8) \\cdot 2!} = \\frac{1}{1/4} = 4$, which matches our $P(\\rho)$.\nThus, the dimensionless radius $\\rho$ follows a Gamma distribution with shape $k=3$ and scale $\\theta=0.5$: $\\rho \\sim \\text{Gamma}(k=3, \\theta=0.5)$.\n\nThe most principled and computationally efficient method to sample from this distribution is to use a high-quality random number generator for the Gamma distribution, available in standard scientific computing libraries such as `NumPy`.\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\n1. For each test case, specified by the number of samples $N$, the random seed, and the threshold $\\rho_0 = r_0/a_0$, initialize a random number generator with the given seed to ensure reproducibility.\n2. Generate $N$ random samples, $\\{\\rho_i\\}_{i=1}^N$, from the $\\text{Gamma}(k=3, \\theta=0.5)$ distribution. Each sample $\\rho_i$ represents a measured value of $r/a_0$.\n3.
