A grid point $(i,j)$ is an interior point if $0 < ih < W$, $0 < jh < H$, and it is not the case that $ih \\ge a$ and $jh \\ge b$. Let the total number of such points be $N$.\n$3$. Construct the $N \\times N$ matrix $\\mathbf{A}$. A mapping is established between the 2D grid coordinates $(i,j)$ of the interior points and a 1D linear index $p \\in [0, N-1]$. The matrix elements $A_{p,q}$ are set as follows:\n    - For the diagonal elements, $A_{p,p} = 4$.\n    - For off-diagonal elements, if point $q$ is an adjacent interior neighbor to point $p$, then $A_{p,q} = -1$.\n    - All other elements are $0$.\nThe resulting matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is a real, symmetric, and sparse matrix.\n$4$. Solve the matrix eigenvalue problem $\\mathbf{A}\\vec{v} = \\lambda\\vec{v}$ to find its eigenvalues $\\lambda$. Since we require the lowest energy states, we compute the smallest $k$ eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}$. Standard numerical linear algebra routines, such as those provided by the `SciPy` library, are used for this task.\n$5$. For each eigenvalue $\\lambda_n$, calculate the corresponding energy $E_n$ in Joules using the scaling factor derived above.\n$$E_n \\,[\\mathrm{J}] = \\lambda_n \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m h^2}$$\n$6$. Convert the energies from Joules to electronvolts (eV) by dividing by the elementary charge $q_\\mathrm{e}$:\n$$E_n \\,[\\mathrm{eV}] = \\frac{E_n \\,[\\mathrm{J}]}{q_\\mathrm{e}}$$\nThese numerical values are then rounded to the specified precision to obtain the final answer. For Case $3$, where the cut-out is outside the domain, the geometry reduces to a simple square box, providing a useful validation of the numerical method against a known analytical solution.", "answer": "```python\n# The final answer must be a single, complete, standalone program.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import linalg\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the lowest energy eigenvalues of a quantum particle in a 2D L-bracket box.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Physical constants in SI units\n    HBAR = 1.054571817e-34  # Reduced Planck constant (J*s)\n    M_E = 9.1093837015e-31   # Electron rest mass (kg)\n    Q_E = 1.602176634e-19    # Elementary charge (C), for J to eV conversion\n\n    # Test suite: (W_nm, H_nm, a_nm, b_nm, h_nm, k)\n    test_cases = [\n        (4.0, 4.0, 2.0, 2.0, 0.2, 3),\n        (4.0, 4.0, 3.0, 1.0, 0.2, 3),\n        (4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 0.2, 3),\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n\n    for W_nm, H_nm, a_nm, b_nm, h_nm, k in test_cases:\n        # Step 1: Set up geometry and grid in SI units\n        nm_to_m = 1e-9\n        W = W_nm * nm_to_m\n        H = H_nm * nm_to_m\n        a = a_nm * nm_to_m\n        b = b_nm * nm_to_m\n        h = h_nm * nm_to_m\n\n        # Number of intervals along each axis\n        Nx = int(round(W / h))\n        Ny = int(round(H / h))\n        # Grid index corresponding to the start of the cut-out\n        ax_idx = int(round(a / h))\n        by_idx = int(round(b / h))\n\n        # Step 2: Identify valid interior points and map them to linear indices\n        # Interior grid indices range from 1 to N-1\n        valid_points = []\n        point_map = {}\n        p_idx_counter = 0\n        for j in range(1, Ny):\n            for i in range(1, Nx):\n                # An interior point (i,j) is removed if it falls within the cut-out region\n                # The cut-out is defined by x >= a and y >= b.\n                # In terms of grid indices, this is i*h >= a and j*h >= b.\n                # which is equivalent to i >= ax_idx and j >= by_idx.\n                if not (i >= ax_idx and j >= by_idx):\n                    valid_points.append((i, j))\n                    point_map[(i, j)] = p_idx_counter\n                    p_idx_counter += 1\n        \n        N = len(valid_points)\n        if N == 0:\n            # This case is not expected for the given problems\n            all_results.extend([float('nan')] * k)\n            continue\n\n        # Step 3: Construct the finite difference matrix A (discrete negative Laplacian)\n        A = np.zeros((N, N), dtype=np.float64)\n\n        for p_idx, (i, j) in enumerate(valid_points):\n            # Diagonal element\n            A[p_idx, p_idx] = 4.0\n            \n            # Off-diagonal elements for neighbors\n            for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                neighbor = (i + di, j + dj)\n                if neighbor in point_map:\n                    q_idx = point_map[neighbor]\n                    A[p_idx, q_idx] = -1.0\n        \n        # Step 4: Find the k smallest eigenvalues of A\n        # scipy.linalg.eigh is efficient for symmetric matrices and returns sorted eigenvalues.\n        # We request the first k eigenvalues by index.\n        eigenvalues_A = linalg.eigh(A, eigvals_only=True, subset_by_index=[0, k - 1])\n        \n        # Step 5 & 6: Calculate energies in eV\n        # E_n = lambda_n * (hbar^2 / (2 * m * h^2))\n        energy_factor_J = (HBAR**2) / (2 * M_E * h**2)\n        energy_factor_eV = energy_factor_J / Q_E\n        \n        energies_eV = eigenvalues_A * energy_factor_eV\n        \n        all_results.extend(energies_eV)\n\n    # Format and print the final results\n    formatted_results = [f\"{e:.6f}\" for e in all_results]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2455594"}]}
