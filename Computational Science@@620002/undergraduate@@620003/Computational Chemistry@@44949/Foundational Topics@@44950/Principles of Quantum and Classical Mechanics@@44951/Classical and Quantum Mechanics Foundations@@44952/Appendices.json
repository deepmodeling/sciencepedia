It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to proceed with a solution. The problem concerns a fundamental topic in computational physics: the numerical integration of ordinary differential equations for a Hamiltonian system, specifically the Kepler problem. The goal is to compare the long-term energy conservation of a non-symplectic integrator (Forward Euler) against a symplectic integrator (Velocity Verlet).\n\nThe system under consideration is the planar two-body problem governed by the Hamiltonian\n$$\nH(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{v}) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2}\\,m\\lVert \\mathbf{v} \\rVert^2 \\;-\\; \\frac{\\mu}{\\lVert \\mathbf{r} \\rVert}.\n$$\nWith the given dimensionless units, the gravitational parameter $\\mu$ and mass $m$ are both set to $1$. The equations of motion are\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{r}} = \\mathbf{v}, \\qquad \\dot{\\mathbf{v}} = \\mathbf{a}(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\frac{\\mathbf{r}}{\\lVert \\mathbf{r} \\rVert^3}.\n$$\nThis is a conservative system, meaning the total energy $E = H(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{v})$ is a constant of motion for the exact, continuous-time solution. Any deviation in energy observed in a numerical simulation is an artifact of the integration algorithm. The quantity $\\delta_{\\max}$ is a measure of the integrator's quality with respect to energy conservation.\n\nThe initial conditions are set for an elliptical orbit with semi-major axis $a=1$. The theoretical energy for such an orbit is constant and given by $E = -\\frac{\\mu}{2a}$. With $\\mu=1$ and $a=1$, the initial energy must be $E_0 = -0.5$. The problem provides initial conditions at periapsis, which correctly correspond to this energy value.\n\nWe will now analyze the two numerical methods.\n\nMethod A: Forward Euler\nThe update rules are:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_{n+1} \\;=\\; \\mathbf{r}_n \\;+\\; \\Delta t \\,\\mathbf{v}_n \\\\\n\\mathbf{v}_{n+1} \\;=\\; \\mathbf{v}_n \\;+\\; \\Delta t \\,\\mathbf{a}(\\mathbf{r}_n)\n$$\nThis is an explicit, first-order method. It is not symplectic. For a Hamiltonian system, non-symplectic methods generally fail to conserve energy, even approximately, over long time scales. For oscillatory systems like the Kepler problem, the Forward Euler method typically introduces a systematic drift in energy. The numerical energy $E_n$ will secularly increase, causing the simulated orbit to deviate from the true elliptical path and spiral outwards. The maximum energy deviation $\\delta_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{A}}$ is therefore expected to grow with the total number of integration steps $N$, and can become substantial.\n\nMethod B: Velocity Verlet\nThe update rules are:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_{n+1} \\;=\\; \\mathbf{r}_n \\;+\\; \\Delta t \\,\\mathbf{v}_n \\;+\\; \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\Delta t^2\\,\\mathbf{a}(\\mathbf{r}_n) \\\\\n\\mathbf{v}_{n+1} \\;=\\; \\mathbf{v}_n \\;+\\; \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\Delta t \\,\\big(\\mathbf{a}(\\mathbf{r}_n)+\\mathbf{a}(\\mathbf{r}_{n+1})\\big)\n$$\nThis is a second-order, time-reversible, and symplectic integrator. Symplectic integrators have a crucial property when applied to Hamiltonian systems: they do not conserve the exact Hamiltonian $H$, but they do exactly conserve a nearby \"shadow\" Hamiltonian, $H_{\\Delta t}$, which differs from $H$ by terms of order $\\Delta t^2$ (for a second-order method). As a consequence, the computed energy $E_n$ will not drift secularly but will instead exhibit bounded oscillations around its initial value $E_0$. The amplitude of these oscillations depends on $\\Delta t$, but the error does not accumulate over time. Therefore, we expect the maximum energy deviation $\\delta_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{B}}$ to be significantly smaller than $\\delta_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{A}}$ and to remain stable over long simulation times.\n\nThe algorithm to solve the problem is as follows:\n$1$. For each test case, specified by eccentricity $e$, time step $\\Delta t$, and number of orbits $M$:\n$2$. Calculate the initial conditions. The position is $\\mathbf{r}_0 = (1-e, 0)$ and velocity is $\\mathbf{v}_0 = (0, \\sqrt{(1+e)/(1-e)})$.\n$3$. Calculate the initial energy $E_0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\lVert \\mathbf{v}_0 \\rVert^2 - 1/\\lVert \\mathbf{r}_0 \\rVert$, which should be exactly $-0.5$.\n$4$. Calculate the total number of steps, $N = \\lfloor 2\\pi M / \\Delta t \\rfloor$.\n$5$. For each method (A and B), perform a loop from $n=0$ to $N-1$:\n    a. At each step, update the position $\\mathbf{r}_n$ and velocity $\\mathbf{v}_n$ to $\\mathbf{r}_{n+1}$ and $\\mathbf{v}_{n+1}$ using the respective integration formulas. The acceleration is $\\mathbf{a}(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\mathbf{r} / \\lVert \\mathbf{r} \\rVert^3$.\n    b. Compute the energy $E_{n+1}$ using the new state vectors.\n    c. Compute the relative energy deviation $|E_{n+1} - E_0|/|E_0|$.\n    d. Keep track of the maximum relative deviation found throughout the simulation.\n$6$. After the loop completes, the final maximum relative deviation $\\delta_{\\max}$ is the result for that method and test case.\n$7$. Collect the $6$ results and format them as required.\n\nThis procedure will be implemented in Python using the `numpy` library for efficient vector operations.

The first $N_{\\mathrm{burn}}$ steps constitute the equilibration or \"burn-in\" phase, and the configurations generated are discarded.\n4.  For steps $i$ from $N_{\\mathrm{burn}}$ to $N_{\\mathrm{steps}}-1$ (the production phase), accumulate the value of the potential energy $U^\\star(r^\\star_{i+1})$.\n5.  The estimate for the average potential energy is the arithmetic mean over the production phase:\n$$\n\\langle U^\\star \\rangle \\approx \\frac{1}{N_{\\mathrm{steps}} - N_{\\mathrm{burn}}} \\sum_{i=N_{\\mathrm{burn}}}^{N_{\\mathrm{steps}}-1} U^\\star(r^\\star_{i+1})\n$$\n\nThis procedure will be implemented for each of the four specified test cases.

Each function is a fixed linear combination of three primitive $s$-type Gaussians, centered at one of the protons ($x = \\pm R/2$). This basis has a total of $N_{bf}=2$ functions.\nb) A larger, uncontracted basis (\"cc-pVTZ-like\") comprising eight functions. For each proton, we use three distinct $s$-type Gaussian primitives and one $p$-type polarization function as independent basis functions. This gives $2 \\times (3 + 1) = 8$ basis functions in total, so $N_{bf}=8$.\n\nFor each basis, solving the generalized eigenvalue problem yields a set of energy eigenvalues and corresponding coefficient vectors. The lowest eigenvalue is the variational approximation to the ground state energy, $E_{\\text{approx}}$. The associated eigenvector $\\mathbf{c}$ is used to construct the approximate wavefunction $\\psi_{\\text{approx}}(x) = \\sum_\\nu c_\\nu \\phi_\\nu(x)$. This wavefunction is then normalized on the grid, again using the trapezoidal rule.\n\n**3. Comparison Metrics**\n\nThe quality of each basis set approximation is quantified by two metrics for each given internuclear separation $R$:\n- **Absolute Energy Error**: $|E_{\\text{approx}}(R) - E_{\\text{ref}}(R)|$. According to the variational principle, this error must be non-negative. A smaller value indicates a better approximation of the energy.\n- **Orbital \"One-Minus-Overlap\"**: $1 - \\left|\\int \\psi_{\\text{approx}}(x;R)\\,\\psi_{\\text{ref}}(x;R)\\,dx \\right|$. This measures the deviation of the approximate wavefunction from the reference.
