All criteria for a valid problem are met.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires a systematic derivation of several quantities based on the provided definitions. We will address each part in sequence.\n\nPart 1: The Transformation and its Inverse\nThe transformation from the Cartesian coordinates $(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2)$ to the center-of-mass and relative coordinates $(\\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{cm}}, \\mathbf{r})$ is given by the system of linear vector equations:\n$$ \\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{cm}} = \\frac{m_1}{M} \\mathbf{r}_1 + \\frac{m_2}{M} \\mathbf{r}_2 $$\n$$ \\mathbf{r} = -\\mathbf{r}_1 + \\mathbf{r}_2 $$\nTo find the inverse transformation, we must solve this system for $\\mathbf{r}_1$ and $\\mathbf{r}_2$. From the second equation, we express $\\mathbf{r}_2$ in terms of $\\mathbf{r}_1$ and $\\mathbf{r}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{r}_2 = \\mathbf{r}_1 + \\mathbf{r} $$\nSubstitute this into the first equation for $\\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{cm}}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{cm}} = \\frac{m_1 \\mathbf{r}_1 + m_2 (\\mathbf{r}_1 + \\mathbf{r})}{M} = \\frac{(m_1 + m_2) \\mathbf{r}_1 + m_2 \\mathbf{r}}{M} = \\frac{M \\mathbf{r}_1 + m_2 \\mathbf{r}}{M} = \\mathbf{r}_1 + \\frac{m_2}{M} \\mathbf{r} $$\nSolving for $\\mathbf{r}_1$ yields:\n$$ \\mathbf{r}_1 = \\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{cm}} - \\frac{m_2}{M} \\mathbf{r} $$\nNow, substitute this expression for $\\mathbf{r}_1$ back into the equation for $\\mathbf{r}_2$:\n$$ \\mathbf{r}_2 = \\left(\\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{cm}} - \\frac{m_2}{M} \\mathbf{r}\\right) + \\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{cm}} + \\left(1 - \\frac{m_2}{M}\\right) \\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{cm}} + \\left(\\frac{M - m_2}{M}\\right) \\mathbf{r} $$\nSince $M = m_1 + m_2$, it follows that $M - m_2 = m_1$. Thus,\n$$ \\mathbf{r}_2 = \\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{cm}} + \\frac{m_1}{M} \\mathbf{r} $$\nThe inverse transformation is therefore:\n$$ \\mathbf{r}_1 = \\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{cm}} - \\frac{m_2}{m_1+m_2} \\mathbf{r} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{r}_2 = \\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{cm}} + \\frac{m_1}{m_1+m_2} \\mathbf{r} $$\n\nPart 2: The Jacobian Determinant\nThe transformation is between the set of $6$ scalar coordinates $(x_1, y_1, z_1, x_2, y_2, z_2)$ that constitute $(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2)$ and the set $(X_{\\mathrm{cm}}, Y_{\\mathrm{cm}}, Z_{\\mathrm{cm}}, x, y, z)$ that constitute $(\\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{cm}}, \\mathbf{r})$. The Jacobian matrix $\\mathbf{J}$ is given by the matrix of partial derivatives $\\frac{\\partial(\\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{cm}}, \\mathbf{r})}{\\partial(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2)}$. Due to the component-wise nature of the linear transformation, we can analyze it in terms of $3 \\times 3$ blocks. The Jacobian matrix is:\n$$ \\mathbf{J} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{cm}}}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_1} & \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{cm}}}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_2} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_1} & \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFrom the defining equations of the forward transformation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{cm}}}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_1} = \\frac{m_1}{M} \\mathbf{I}_3 \\quad , \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{cm}}}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_2} = \\frac{m_2}{M} \\mathbf{I}_3 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_1} = -\\mathbf{I}_3 \\quad , \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_2} = \\mathbf{I}_3 $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{I}_3$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix. The $6 \\times 6$ Jacobian matrix is:\n$$ \\mathbf{J} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{m_1}{M} \\mathbf{I}_3 & \\frac{m_2}{M} \\mathbf{I}_3 \\\\ -\\mathbf{I}_3 & \\mathbf{I}_3 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nIt is simpler to compute the determinant of the Jacobian of the inverse transformation, $\\mathbf{J}^{-1} = \\frac{\\partial(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2)}{\\partial(\\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{cm}}, \\mathbf{r})}$, and then use the identity $\\det(\\mathbf{J}) = (\\det(\\mathbf{J}^{-1}))^{-1}$. From the inverse transformation equations:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_1}{\\partial \\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{cm}}} = \\mathbf{I}_3 \\quad , \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_1}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}} = -\\frac{m_2}{M} \\mathbf{I}_3 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_2}{\\partial \\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{cm}}} = \\mathbf{I}_3 \\quad , \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_2}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}} = \\frac{m_1}{M} \\mathbf{I}_3 $$\nSo the Jacobian of the inverse transformation is:\n$$ \\mathbf{J}^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{I}_3 & -\\frac{m_2}{M} \\mathbf{I}_3 \\\\ \\mathbf{I}_3 & \\frac{m_1}{M} \\mathbf{I}_3 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nUsing the formula for the determinant of a block matrix, $\\det \\begin{pmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{pmatrix} = \\det(A) \\det(D - CA^{-1}B)$, with $A = \\mathbf{I}_3, B = -\\frac{m_2}{M} \\mathbf{I}_3, C = \\mathbf{I}_3, D = \\frac{m_1}{M} \\mathbf{I}_3$:\n$$ \\det(\\mathbf{J}^{-1}) = \\det(\\mathbf{I}_3) \\det\\left(\\frac{m_1}{M} \\mathbf{I}_3 - (\\mathbf{I}_3)(\\mathbf{I}_3)^{-1}(-\\frac{m_2}{M}\\mathbf{I}_3)\\right) $$\n$$ \\det(\\mathbf{J}^{-1}) = 1 \\cdot \\det\\left(\\frac{m_1}{M} \\mathbf{I}_3 + \\frac{m_2}{M}\\mathbf{I}_3\\right) = \\det\\left(\\frac{m_1+m_2}{M}\\mathbf{I}_3\\right) = \\det\\left(\\frac{M}{M}\\mathbf{I}_3\\right) = \\det(\\mathbf{I}_3) = 1 $$\nThe Jacobian determinant of the inverse transformation is $1$. Therefore, the Jacobian determinant of the forward transformation is $J = \\det(\\mathbf{J}) = (\\det(\\mathbf{J}^{-1}))^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1$. The absolute value is $|J|=1$.\n\nPart 3: Kinetic Energy, Reduced Mass, and Mass-Weighted Coordinates\nTo express the kinetic energy $T$ in the new coordinates, we differentiate the inverse transformation relations with respect to time:\n$$ \\dot{\\mathbf{r}}_1 = \\dot{\\mathbf{R}}_{\\mathrm{cm}} - \\frac{m_2}{M} \\dot{\\mathbf{r}} $$\n$$ \\dot{\\mathbf{r}}_2 = \\dot{\\mathbf{R}}_{\\mathrm{cm}} + \\frac{m_1}{M} \\dot{\\mathbf{r}} $$\nSubstitute these into the expression for $T$:\n$$ T = \\frac{1}{2} m_1 \\left| \\dot{\\mathbf{R}}_{\\mathrm{cm}} - \\frac{m_2}{M} \\dot{\\mathbf{r}} \\right|^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_2 \\left| \\dot{\\mathbf{R}}_{\\mathrm{cm}} + \\frac{m_1}{M} \\dot{\\mathbf{r}} \\right|^2 $$\nExpanding the squared norms (dot products):\n$$ T = \\frac{1}{2} m_1 \\left( |\\dot{\\mathbf{R}}_{\\mathrm{cm}}|^2 - 2\\frac{m_2}{M}(\\dot{\\mathbf{R}}_{\\mathrm{cm}} \\cdot \\dot{\\mathbf{r}}) + \\frac{m_2^2}{M^2}|\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}|^2 \\right) + \\frac{1}{2} m_2 \\left( |\\dot{\\mathbf{R}}_{\\mathrm{cm}}|^2 + 2\\frac{m_1}{M}(\\dot{\\mathbf{R}}_{\\mathrm{cm}} \\cdot \\dot{\\mathbf{r}}) + \\frac{m_1^2}{M^2}|\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}|^2 \\right) $$\nGroup terms by the types of velocities:\nThe term for $|\\dot{\\mathbf{R}}_{\\mathrm{cm}}|^2$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(m_1+m_2)|\\dot{\\mathbf{R}}_{\\mathrm{cm}}|^2 = \\frac{1}{2}M|\\dot{\\mathbf{R}}_{\\mathrm{cm}}|^2$.\nThe cross-term for $(\\dot{\\mathbf{R}}_{\\mathrm{cm}} \\cdot \\dot{\\mathbf{r}})$ is $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(-2\\frac{m_1m_2}{M} + 2\\frac{m_2m_1}{M}\\right)(\\dot{\\mathbf{R}}_{\\mathrm{cm}} \\cdot \\dot{\\mathbf{r}}) = 0$.\nThe term for $|\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}|^2$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\left( m_1 \\frac{m_2^2}{M^2} + m_2 \\frac{m_1^2}{M^2} \\right) |\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{m_1m_2(m_2+m_1)}{M^2} |\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{m_1m_2 M}{M^2} |\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{m_1m_2}{M} |\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}|^2$.\nWe define the reduced mass $\\mu$ as $\\mu = \\frac{m_1m_2}{m_1+m_2} = \\frac{m_1m_2}{M}$.\nThe kinetic energy separates into two independent terms:\n$$ T = \\frac{1}{2}M|\\dot{\\mathbf{R}}_{\\mathrm{cm}}|^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\mu|\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}|^2 $$\nThe first term is the translational kinetic energy of the entire molecule treated as a point mass $M$ at the center of mass. The second term is the kinetic energy of the internal motion, described by the relative vector $\\mathbf{r}$. The mass associated with this internal motion is the reduced mass, $\\mu$. Thus, $\\mu$ is the effective mass for motion associated with the internuclear separation $R=|\\mathbf{r}|$.\n\nFor a diatomic molecule, a Z-matrix describes the internal geometry with a single coordinate, the bond length $R_{12}$. This is precisely the magnitude $R=|\\mathbf{r}|$ of our relative vector. The kinetic energy expression shows that the internal motion, with effective mass $\\mu$, is dynamically decoupled from the overall translation.\n\nMass-weighted coordinates are constructed to simplify the kinetic energy expression for vibrations. For a general set of internal coordinates $S_k$, the vibrational kinetic energy is $2T_{vib} = \\dot{\\mathbf{S}}^T \\mathbf{G}^{-1} \\dot{\\mathbf{S}}$. For the single stretching coordinate $S_1 = R$, the corresponding Wilson G-matrix element is $G_{11} = \\frac{1}{m_1} + \\frac{1}{m_2} = \\frac{m_1+m_2}{m_1m_2} = \\frac{1}{\\mu}$. The kinetic energy for vibration is $T_{vib} = \\frac{1}{2} G_{11}^{-1} (\\dot{S}_1)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu \\dot{R}^2$. A mass-weighted internal coordinate, $\\mathcal{S}_{stretch}$, is defined such that the kinetic energy has the form $T_{vib} = \\frac{1}{2}\\dot{\\mathcal{S}}_{stretch}^2$. Comparing the two forms, we see that $\\dot{\\mathcal{S}}_{stretch}^2 = \\mu \\dot{R}^2$, which implies $\\mathcal{S}_{stretch} = \\sqrt{\\mu}R$.\nThe corresponding mass-weighted internal coordinate for bond stretching is $\\sqrt{\\mu}R$.\n\nThe problem requires reporting the Jacobian determinant $J$.\n$$ J=1 $$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "2452024"}, {"introduction": "The separation of molecular motion into internal (vibrational) and external (translational and rotational) components is a cornerstone of chemical physics.

The internal coordinates are, by definition, invariant under any translation $\\mathbf{r}_i(t) \\to \\mathbf{r}_i(t) + \\mathbf{T}(t)$. Since the provided data contains no information to fix the molecule's position in space, it is fundamentally impossible to determine $\\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{COM}}(t)$.

Similar to translation, internal coordinates are invariant under rigid rotations. From the internal coordinates, one can construct the molecule's shape and compute properties relative to the molecule's body-fixed frame (such as the moment of inertia tensor in that frame), but one cannot determine the orientation of this body-fixed frame with respect to the external laboratory frame. This information corresponds to the $3$ rotational degrees of freedom that have been discarded. Therefore, the overall rotational orientation is unrecoverable.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D.

From these internal coordinates, it is possible to algorithmically construct a set of relative Cartesian coordinates for all atoms, for instance, by placing the first atom at the origin, the second on an axis, and the third on a plane. Once these relative atomic positions $\\{\\mathbf{r}_i^{\\text{rel}}\\}$ are known for a given time $t$, any pairwise interatomic distance can be calculated as $d_{ij}(t) = ||\\mathbf{r}_i^{\\text{rel}}(t) - \\mathbf{r}_j^{\\text{rel}}(t)||$.

The bond angle, $\\angle(4,3,2)$, is the angle formed by the vectors $\\vec{r}_{34}$ and $\\vec{r}_{32}$.\n$3$. The dihedral angle, $\\tau(4,3,2,1)$, is the angle between two planes: the plane containing atoms $(4,3,2)$ and the plane containing atoms $(3,2,1)$.\n\nThe critical issue arises from the definition of the dihedral angle. A plane is uniquely defined by three non-colinear points. The problem states that atoms $1$, $2$, and $3$ are colinear, as their bond angle $\\angle(1,2,3)$ is $180^\\circ$. Consequently, the three points defining the reference plane $(3,2,1)$ lie on a straight line.\n\nAn infinite number of planes can contain a given line. Thus, the reference plane $(3,2,1)$ is not uniquely defined. As a result, the dihedral angle $\\tau(4,3,2,1)$, which is measured with respect to this undefined plane, is itself undefined.\n\nLet's consider the geometric construction of the position of atom $4$.\n- The distance $r_{43}$ confines atom $4$ to the surface of a sphere of radius $r_{43}$ centered on atom $3$.\n- The angle $\\angle(4,3,2)$ confines atom $4$ to the surface of a cone with its apex at atom $3$ and its axis along the line passing through atoms $2$ and $3$.\n- The intersection of this sphere and cone is a circle, centered on and perpendicular to the axis $1-2-3$.\n\nThe purpose of the dihedral angle is to specify a unique point on this circle. Since $\\tau(4,3,2,1)$ is undefined, there is no information to distinguish one point on the circle from another. Any position for atom $4$ on this circle satisfies the given bond length and bond angle. Therefore, a single set of Z-matrix parameters $(r_{43}, \\angle(4,3,2), \\tau(4,3,2,1))$ corresponds not to a single Cartesian geometry, but to an infinite set of geometries. The mapping from this set of internal coordinates to Cartesian coordinates is non-unique.\n\nThis has a direct mathematical consequence for the **Wilson B-matrix**, which is the Jacobian matrix of the transformation from Cartesian coordinates $\\mathbf{x}$ to internal coordinates $\\mathbf{s}$, where infinitesimally, $d\\mathbf{s} = \\mathbf{B} d\\mathbf{x}$. The non-uniqueness of the internal-to-Cartesian mapping implies that there are non-zero Cartesian displacements $d\\mathbf{x}$ (corresponding to movement of atom $4$ around the circle) that produce zero change in the defined internal coordinates, $d\\mathbf{s} = \\mathbf{0}$. This means that the null space of the $\\mathbf{B}$ matrix is non-trivial, which proves that the $\\mathbf{B}$ matrix is singular (i.e., rank-deficient).\n\nA singular $\\mathbf{B}$ matrix is computationally problematic. For instance, in geometry optimization, many algorithms require the inverse of the force constant matrix transformed into internal coordinates, which depends on the $\\mathbf{G}$ matrix, defined as $\\mathbf{G} = \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{M}^{-1} \\mathbf{B}^T$, where $\\mathbf{M}$ is the diagonal matrix of atomic masses. If $\\mathbf{B}$ is singular, $\\mathbf{G}$ is also singular and cannot be inverted, causing such algorithms to fail. The same issue plagues vibrational frequency calculations.\n\nThe same logic applies to the definition of atom $5$ via the dihedral angle $\\tau(5,3,2,1)$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The dihedral angles for atoms $4$ and $5$ become undefined, so multiple Cartesian realizations correspond to the same internal coordinates, making the Wilson $B$-matrix singular (rank-deficient) and the internal-to-Cartesian mapping non-unique.**\nThis statement correctly identifies all key aspects of the problem. The colinearity of atoms $1, 2, 3$ makes the dihedral angles undefined. This leads to a non-unique mapping from internal to Cartesian coordinates (an infinite number of possible structures). This non-uniqueness is mathematically expressed as a singular (rank-deficient) Wilson B-matrix. This statement is a complete and accurate description of the consequence.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The bond lengths $r_{43}$ and $r_{53}$ are still uniquely determined, but the total potential energy becomes independent of the bond angle $\\angle(4,3,2)$, so optimization proceeds with a flat bending coordinate.**\nThe bond lengths are inputs to the Z-matrix; they are determined by definition. However, the claim that the potential energy becomes independent of the bond angle $\\angle(4,3,2)$ is physically incorrect. Bending a molecule costs energy. The problem lies with the *dihedral* coordinate, not the bending coordinate. The potential energy is certainly a function of the bend angle. Thus, this statement misdiagnoses the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The Z-matrix remains well-defined; a geometry optimizer will automatically rotate the molecule in Cartesian space to remove the colinearity and then interpret the same Z-matrix without ambiguity.**\nThe Z-matrix, as specified, is fundamentally *not* well-defined because it does not map to a unique geometry. A geometry optimizer cannot \"remove the colinearity\" if the equilibrium structure of the molecule is indeed linear (e.g., acetylene). Furthermore, an optimizer works within a given coordinate system; it does not arbitrarily change it. The issue must be resolved by providing a different, valid Z-matrix definition (e.g., using dummy atoms to define the reference plane) or by switching to a coordinate system that does not have this pathology, such as Cartesian coordinates.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Transforming to mass-weighted Cartesian coordinates removes the degeneracy introduced by colinearity, so geometry optimization and vibrational analysis can proceed without numerical issues.**\nMass-weighted coordinates ($q_{i\\alpha} = \\sqrt{m_i} x_{i\\alpha}$) are a mathematical transformation that simplifies the kinetic energy term in the equations of motion. This transformation does not alter the underlying geometry or the relationships between internal and Cartesian coordinates. The problem of the undefined dihedral angle is a geometric one, and it persists regardless of whether coordinates are mass-weighted or not.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Only a mirror-image ambiguity about a plane arises, but the torsional coordinates $\\tau(4,3,2,1)$ and $\\tau(5,3,2,1)$ remain well-defined and distinguishable.**\nThis statement is fundamentally false. The issue is not a simple ambiguity between two values (e.g., $+\\theta$ and $-\\theta$), which would be a mirror-image ambiguity. The torsional coordinates are completely undefined because their reference plane does not exist. There is a continuum of possible positions for atoms $4$ and $5$, not just two.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2451992"}]}
