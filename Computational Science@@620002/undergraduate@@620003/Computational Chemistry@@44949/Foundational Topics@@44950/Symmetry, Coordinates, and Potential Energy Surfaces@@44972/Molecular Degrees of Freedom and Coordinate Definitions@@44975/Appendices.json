Provide your final answer as an integer.", "solution": "The problem statement has been subjected to rigorous validation and is deemed to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on established principles of molecular physics and chemistry, contains all necessary information, and is free of contradictions or ambiguities. Therefore, I will proceed with its solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of vibrational degrees of freedom for the triatomic ion $H_3^+$. The total number of degrees of freedom for a molecule composed of $N$ atoms, treated as point masses, in three-dimensional space is $3N$. This is because each atom's position can be described by three independent Cartesian coordinates ($x$, $y$, $z$).\n\nFor the $H_3^+$ ion, the number of atoms is $N=3$. Thus, the total number of degrees of freedom is:\n$$N_{\\text{total}} = 3N = 3 \\times 3 = 9$$\n\nThese total degrees of freedom can be partitioned into three types of motion for the molecule as a whole: translational, rotational, and vibrational.\n$$N_{\\text{total}} = N_{\\text{trans}} + N_{\\text{rot}} + N_{\\text{vib}}$$\n\nThe number of translational degrees of freedom, $N_{\\text{trans}}$, corresponds to the motion of the molecule's center of mass. In three-dimensional space, there are always $3$ independent directions of translation (e.g., along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes). Therefore:\n$$N_{\\text{trans}} = 3$$\n\nThe number of rotational degrees of freedom, $N_{\\text{rot}}$, depends on the geometry of the molecule.\n- For a **linear** molecule, all atoms lie on a single axis. Rotation about this axis does not change the positions of the nuclei and corresponds to a moment of inertia that is effectively zero. Thus, there are only $2$ rotational degrees of freedom, corresponding to rotation about two axes perpendicular to the internuclear axis.\n- For a **non-linear** molecule, the atoms do not all lie on a single line. The molecule has non-zero moments of inertia about three mutually perpendicular principal axes. Therefore, there are $3$ rotational degrees of freedom.\n\nThe problem states that the stable form of $H_3^+$ is an equilateral triangle. An equilateral triangle is a planar but non-linear arrangement of three atoms. Consequently, the $H_3^+$ ion is a non-linear molecule. The number of rotational degrees of freedom is:\n$$N_{\\text{rot}} = 3$$\n\nThe number of vibrational degrees of freedom, $N_{\\text{vib}}$, represents the internal motions of the atoms relative to each other that change the molecule's shape (bond lengths and angles). This number is what remains after accounting for the rigid-body motions of translation and rotation. We can calculate it by rearranging the partition equation:\n$$N_{\\text{vib}} = N_{\\text{total}} - N_{\\text{trans}} - N_{\\text{rot}}$$\n\nSubstituting the values for a non-linear molecule:\n$$N_{\\text{vib}} = 3N - 3 - 3 = 3N - 6$$\n\nNow, we apply this formula to the $H_3^+$ ion, for which $N=3$:\n$$N_{\\text{vib}} = 3(3) - 6 = 9 - 6 = 3$$\n\nTherefore, the $H_3^+$ ion possesses $3$ vibrational degrees of freedom. These correspond to the symmetric stretch (a breathing mode) and a pair of degenerate asymmetric stretch and bending modes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "2458109"}, {"introduction": "While the rules for counting degrees of freedom are powerful, they sometimes reveal subtleties in molecular structure. Linear molecules represent a special case, and as this practice explores [@problem_id:2458083], a simple count of intuitive internal coordinates like bond lengths and angles may not match the total number of vibrational modes predicted by the $3N-5$ rule.

The formula for the number of vibrational modes of a linear molecule, $3N-5$, is a fundamental result from the theory of molecular vibrations.

This is a standard and non-trivial question in molecular spectroscopy.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is therefore permissible to proceed with a full derivation and analysis.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nA molecule composed of $N$ atoms possesses a total of $3N$ degrees of freedom, corresponding to the $3$ Cartesian coordinates required to specify the position of each atom in space. For $\\text{CO_2}$, with $N=3$, there are $3 \\times 3 = 9$ total degrees of freedom.\n\nThese degrees of freedom are partitioned into translational, rotational, and vibrational motions of the molecule as a whole.\n1.  **Translational Motion**: The motion of the molecule's center of mass. This accounts for $3$ degrees of freedom, corresponding to translation along three mutually orthogonal axes (e.g., $x, y, z$).\n2.  **Rotational Motion**: The rotation of the molecule about its center of mass. For a non-linear molecule, there are $3$ rotational degrees of freedom. However, for a linear molecule like $\\text{CO_2}$, the atoms lie on a single axis. Rotation about this axis does not change the position of any nucleus and therefore has a moment of inertia of zero (in the idealized case). Consequently, this motion is not considered a molecular rotation. A linear molecule has only $2$ rotational degrees of freedom, corresponding to end-over-end rotation about two axes perpendicular to the molecular axis.\n3.  **Vibrational Motion**: The remaining degrees of freedom must correspond to internal vibrations, where the atoms move relative to each other while the center of mass remains fixed and the molecule does not rotate. The number of vibrational degrees of freedom (or normal modes) is therefore:\n    $$ N_{\\text{vib}} = 3N - (\\text{translational}) - (\\text{rotational}) $$\n    For a linear molecule, this is:\n    $$ N_{\\text{vib}} = 3N - 3 - 2 = 3N-5 $$\n    As correctly stated in the problem, for $\\text{CO_2}$ ($N=3$), this gives $N_{\\text{vib}} = 3(3) - 5 = 4$ vibrational modes.\n\nNow, one must analyze the relationship between these modes and the internal coordinates. The problem provides a set of $3$ simple valence internal coordinates: two bond lengths ($r_1$ and $r_2$) and one bond angle ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{OCO}}$).\n\n- **Stretching Modes**: The two bond length coordinates, $r_1$ and $r_2$, can be combined to form two independent normal modes of vibration:\n    - The symmetric stretch ($\\nu_1$), where both bonds lengthen and shorten in phase.\n    - The asymmetric stretch ($\\nu_3$), where one bond lengthens as the other shortens.\n    Thus, the two stretching coordinates account for two of the four vibrational modes.\n\n- **Bending Modes**: The bond angle coordinate, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{OCO}}$, describes the bending of the molecule away from its linear geometry. A change in this angle from $180^\\circ$ represents a bending vibration. However, this bending motion can occur in any plane containing the molecular axis. Let us define the molecular axis as the $z$-axis. The molecule can bend in the $xz$-plane. This motion can be described by one coordinate and constitutes one vibrational mode. Crucially, the molecule can also bend in the $yz$-plane, which is orthogonal to the $xz$-plane. This second bending motion is independent of the first. Due to the axial symmetry of the linear molecule, these two bending motions are energetically equivalent. They have the same vibrational frequency and are said to be **doubly degenerate**.\n\nThe set of $3$ simple internal coordinates ($r_1, r_2, \\theta_{\\mathrm{OCO}}$) is insufficient to describe the full $4$-dimensional space of vibrational motion. The angle $\\theta_{\\mathrm{OCO}}$ describes the magnitude of the bend, but it does not distinguish between a bend in the $xz$-plane and a bend in the $yz$-plane. To fully specify the bending, two coordinates are required, corresponding to the two orthogonal components of the atomic displacements perpendicular to the molecular axis. These two coordinates give rise to the two degenerate bending modes.\n\nTherefore, the four vibrational modes of $\\text{CO_2}$ are the symmetric stretch, the asymmetric stretch, and a pair of degenerate bending modes. The \"fourth\" mode, which is missing from a simple count of the three specified valence coordinates, is the second, orthogonal component of the degenerate bending vibration.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. A second, independent bending motion in a plane orthogonal to the plane used to define $\\theta_{\\mathrm{OCO}}$; the other component of the doubly degenerate bend.**\nThis statement is precisely correct. The bending vibration in a linear molecule is doubly degenerate, corresponding to two orthogonal motions of identical energy. The standard definition of a single bond angle $\\theta_{\\mathrm{OCO}}$ captures only one of these, or more accurately, their combined amplitude. The second independent mode is the other orthogonal component of the bend. This accounts for the fourth vibrational mode.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. A torsional vibration corresponding to twisting about the molecular axis.**\nTorsion involves the relative rotation of groups of atoms about a chemical bond. In a linear molecule like $\\text{CO_2}$, all atoms lie on the internuclear axis. There are no off-axis atoms to twist relative to one another. \"Twisting\" the molecule about its axis does not change the relative positions of the nuclei and is therefore not a vibration. This is fundamentally incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. A rigid translation of the entire molecule along its molecular axis.**\nThis describes a translational degree of freedom, not a vibrational one. Vibrations are *internal* motions, whereas translation moves the entire molecule's center of mass. This has already been accounted for separately from the $3N-5$ vibrational modes.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. A rigid rotation of the entire molecule about its molecular axis.**\nThis describes a rotational degree of freedom. As explained previously, for a linear molecule, rotation about the internuclear axis is not a valid molecular rotation because it does not displace the nuclei. This degree of freedom does not exist in the standard model of molecular motion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. A second symmetric stretch in which both C-O bonds change length in phase, independent of the first symmetric stretch.**\nThe symmetric stretch is a single, non-degenerate normal mode. By definition, a normal mode is an independent, synchronous motion of the atoms. There cannot be two independent symmetric stretch modes. The two bond-stretching coordinates give rise to one symmetric and one asymmetric stretch, and that is all. This statement is a contradiction in terms.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2458083"}, {"introduction": "Moving from abstract counts to concrete representations is a key skill in computational chemistry.

It requests the implementation of a standard coordinate transformation algorithm from internal Z-matrix coordinates to Cartesian coordinates for a triatomic molecule, using a precisely defined reference frame. The provided mathematical formulas and test cases are consistent and scientifically sound.\n\nThe core principle is the conversion of a molecule's geometry, specified by internal coordinates (bond lengths and angles), into a set of Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$ for each atom. This is a fundamental operation in computational chemistry and molecular modeling. Because a non-linear molecule with $N$ atoms has $3N-6$ internal degrees of freedom, a full description in a $3N$-dimensional Cartesian space requires the removal of $6$ degrees of freedom corresponding to global translation and rotation.
