The algorithm operates on a simplex, which is a geometric figure consisting of $n+1$ vertices in an $n$-dimensional space (e.g., a triangle in 2D).\n\nConsider the minimization of a cost function $f(x, y)$ of two variables using the Nelder-Mead algorithm. At a certain iteration, the simplex is defined by three vertices: $v_A = (1, 2)$, $v_B = (5, 4)$, and $v_C = (3, 6)$. The corresponding values of the cost function at these vertices are $f(v_A) = 10$, $f(v_B) = 25$, and $f(v_C) = 15$.\n\nThe first step in a Nelder-Mead iteration is to identify the best (lowest function value), next-worst, and worst (highest function value) vertices. Then, a new test point is generated by \"reflecting\" the worst vertex through the centroid of the remaining vertices.\n\nThe centroid, $v_c$, is calculated as the average of the positions of all vertices except for the worst one. The reflection point, $v_r$, is then computed using the formula $v_r = v_c + \\alpha(v_c - v_{w})$, where $v_{w}$ is the worst vertex and $\\alpha$ is the reflection coefficient. For this problem, use the standard reflection coefficient $\\alpha = 1$.\n\nCalculate the coordinates of the reflection point, $v_r$.

By definition, the best vertex has the lowest function value, the worst has the highest, and the next-worst is the remaining one. Therefore, the best is $v_{A}$, the next-worst is $v_{C}$, and the worst is $v_{B}$ since $25$ is the largest value.\n\nThe centroid $v_{c}$ is computed as the average of the vertices excluding the worst.
