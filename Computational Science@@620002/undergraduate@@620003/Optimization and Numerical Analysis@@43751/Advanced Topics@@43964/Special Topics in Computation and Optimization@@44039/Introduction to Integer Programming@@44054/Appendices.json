The team must have a minimum level of combined expertise in three critical areas: Medicine, Logistics, and Engineering. The goal is to form a team that meets all requirements while minimizing the total annual salary cost.\n\nThe available experts, their area(s) of expertise, and their annual salaries are listed below:\n\n*   Expert 1: Dr. Adams (Medicine) - Salary: $90,000\n*   Expert 2: Dr. Bell (Medicine) - Salary: $85,000\n*   Expert 3: Mr. Carter (Logistics) - Salary: $70,000\n*   Expert 4: Ms. Davis (Engineering) - Salary: $95,000\n*   Expert 5: Dr. Evans (Medicine, Logistics) - Salary: $120,000\n*   Expert 6: Ms. Frost (Logistics, Engineering) - Salary: $135,000\n\nThe composition of the team must satisfy the following minimum requirements:\n*   At least 2 team members must have expertise in Medicine.\n*   At least 2 team members must have expertise in Logistics.\n*   At least 1 team member must have expertise in Engineering.\n\nNote that a single expert with multiple specializations can contribute to satisfying the requirement for each of their areas of expertise. Determine the minimum possible total annual salary cost for a team that meets all the specified requirements. Express your final answer in dollars.", "solution": "Let $x_{i} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ indicate whether expert $i$ is selected, with costs\n$$\n(c_{1},c_{2},c_{3},c_{4},c_{5},c_{6})=(90000,85000,70000,95000,120000,135000).\n$$\nSkill constraints are\n$$\n\\text{Medicine: } x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{5} \\ge 2,\\quad\n\\text{Logistics: } x_{3}+x_{5}+x_{6} \\ge 2,\\quad\n\\text{Engineering: } x_{4}+x_{6} \\ge 1,\n$$\nand the objective is to minimize $\\sum_{i=1}^{6} c_{i}x_{i}$.\n\nFirst, no two-person team can satisfy the requirements. With two members and $\\ge 2$ in Logistics, both must be from $\\{3,5,6\\}$. With $\\ge 2$ in Medicine, both must be from $\\{1,2,5\\}$. Intersecting these, both members would have to be from $\\{5\\}$, which is impossible, or the pair $\\{5,6\\}$; however, $6$ is not Medicine, so $\\{5,6\\}$ yields only one Medicine expert. Therefore, no two-person team is feasible.\n\nConsider three-person teams. The Engineering constraint requires selecting at least one of $\\{4,6\\}$.\n\n1) If $4$ is selected and $6$ is not selected, then to achieve $\\ge 2$ in Logistics using the remaining two slots, we must take $3$ and $5$. This gives exactly one Medicine expert (only $5$), violating $x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{5} \\ge 2$. Hence no feasible three-person team includes $4$ without $6$.\n\n2) If both $4$ and $6$ are selected, then to achieve $\\ge 2$ in Logistics, the third member must be in $\\{3,5\\}$. In either case, the total number of Medicine experts among $\\{4,6,3\\}$ is $0$ and among $\\{4,6,5\\}$ is $1$, so the Medicine requirement fails. Hence no feasible three-person team includes both $4$ and $6$.\n\nTherefore, any feasible three-person team must include $6$ and exclude $4$. With $6$ fixed, the Logistics requirement $x_{3}+x_{5}+x_{6} \\ge 2$ implies that at least one of $\\{3,5\\}$ must also be selected. Since $6$ has no Medicine expertise, to satisfy $x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{5} \\ge 2$ the other two members must include two Medicine experts from $\\{1,2,5\\}$. Combining these, the only feasible pairs to go with $6$ are $\\{1,5\\}$ and $\\{2,5\\}$. Thus the only feasible three-person teams are\n$$\n\\{1,5,6\\} \\text{ with cost } 90000+120000+135000=345000,\n$$\n$$\n\\{2,5,6\\} \\text{ with cost } 85000+120000+135000=340000.\n$$\nAmong three-person teams, the minimum cost is $340000$.\n\nTo confirm global optimality, observe that the four smallest salaries are $70000,85000,90000,95000$, summing to $340000$. The unique four-person team with this cost is $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$, which fails the Logistics requirement (only one Logistics expert). Therefore any feasible four-person team must replace at least one of $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ with either $5$ or $6$, raising the cost to at least\n$$\n70000+85000+90000+120000=365000>340000.\n$$\nAny larger team costs even more.
