For any initial guess on an axis, the first iteration of Newton's method produces a point that is also on an axis, preventing the algorithm from ever moving towards a solution, as the solutions do not lie on an axis.\n\nB.

The point $(0,0)$ is the only location where the Jacobian is singular. An initial guess on an axis that is close to the origin leads to a nearly-singular Jacobian, causing the subsequent iteration to produce a point extremely far from the true solution, indicating poor convergence behavior.\n\nE.

Therefore option E is false.\n\nIt remains to identify the fundamental reason axes are a poor choice for initial guesses. Since\n$$\n\\det J(x,y)=2(x^{2}+y^{2}),\n$$\nthe Jacobian is singular at $(0,0)$ and becomes ill-conditioned when $(x,y)$ is close to the origin. The explicit inverse is\n$$\nJ(x,y)^{-1}=\\frac{1}{2(x^{2}+y^{2})}\\begin{pmatrix}x  2y\\\\ -y  2x\\end{pmatrix},\n$$\nwhose entries scale like $\\frac{1}{x^{2}+y^{2}}$ times linear functions of $x$ and $y$. Near the origin this produces large Newton steps. On the axes in particular, the Newton updates derived above contain terms like $\\frac{3}{x}$ or $\\frac{3}{y}$, which become very large in magnitude when the initial guess is on an axis and close to the origin. This ill-conditioning explains the observed poor performance and is precisely captured by option D.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental reason is that the Jacobian is singular at the origin and nearly singular for axis-aligned initial guesses near the origin, leading to instability and poor convergence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2207871"}]}
