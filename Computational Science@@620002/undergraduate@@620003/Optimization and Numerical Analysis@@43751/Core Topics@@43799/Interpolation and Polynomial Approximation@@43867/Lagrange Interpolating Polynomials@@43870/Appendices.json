This unique polynomial is the Lagrange interpolating polynomial, $P(x)$.\n\nThe given points $(x_i, y_i)$ are collinear and lie on the line $y = mx + c$, with the constraint that $m \\neq 0$. This means that for every point in the set, the coordinates satisfy the relation $y_i = mx_i + c$.\n\nLet's define a new polynomial, $Q(x) = mx + c$.\nFirst, let's determine the degree of $Q(x)$. Since it is a polynomial in the form of a linear equation and the coefficient of the $x$ term, $m$, is explicitly non-zero ($m \\neq 0$), the degree of $Q(x)$ is exactly 1.\n\nNext, let's check if this polynomial $Q(x)$ passes through all the given data points. We can evaluate $Q(x)$ at each of the $x_i$ coordinates:\n$$Q(x_i) = m x_i + c$$\nFrom the problem statement, we know that for each point, $y_i = m x_i + c$. Therefore, we have:\n$$Q(x_i) = y_i$$\nThis is true for all $i = 0, 1, \\dots, n$.

The Lagrange polynomial, $P(x)$, is the *unique* polynomial of degree *at most* $n$ that serves this purpose. Since we have found such a polynomial and proven its uniqueness (as part of the theorem), it must be that $P(x)$ is identical to $Q(x)$.\n$$P(x) = Q(x) = mx + c$$\nThe degree of $P(x)$ is therefore the degree of $mx+c$.

The degree is always 1. Our derivation shows this is correct. The unique polynomial that fits the collinear points is the line itself.\nC. The degree is always 0.

This is incorrect; the uniqueness of the interpolating polynomial ensures there is one specific outcome.\nE. The degree is always 2. This is incorrect.
