The two boundary points, $x_0 = -1$ and $x_2 = 2$, are chosen as fixed nodes. You have the freedom to choose the location of the third node, $x_1 = a$, at any point strictly between the boundaries, i.e., $a \\in (-1, 2)$.\n\nDetermine the value of $a$ that minimizes the maximum absolute value of the nodal polynomial, $\\max_{x \\in [-1, 2]} |\\omega(x)|$.", "solution": "The problem asks us to find the value of $a \\in (-1, 2)$ that minimizes the quantity $M(a) = \\max_{x \\in [-1, 2]} |\\omega(x)|$, where the nodal polynomial $\\omega(x)$ is given by the nodes $x_0 = -1$, $x_1 = a$, and $x_2 = 2$.\n\nThe nodal polynomial is:\n$$\n\\omega(x) = (x - x_0)(x - x_1)(x - x_2) = (x + 1)(x - a)(x - 2)\n$$\nThe optimization problem is to solve:\n$$\n\\min_{a \\in (-1, 2)} \\left( \\max_{x \\in [-1, 2]} |(x + 1)(x - a)(x - 2)| \\right)\n$$\nThe problem is set on an asymmetric interval $[-1, 2]$. It is often simpler to analyze such problems on the symmetric interval $[-1, 1]$. We can achieve this by using an affine transformation that maps a new variable $t \\in [-1, 1]$ to our original variable $x \\in [-1, 2]$.\n\nLet the transformation be $x(t) = mt + b$. We need to find the constants $m$ and $b$. We map the endpoints of the intervals:\n- When $t = -1$, we want $x = -1$: $-1 = m(-1) + b \\implies -1 = -m + b$.\n- When $t = 1$, we want $x = 2$: $2 = m(1) + b \\implies 2 = m + b$.\n\nThis is a system of two linear equations. Adding the two equations gives:\n$$\n(-1) + 2 = (-m + b) + (m + b) \\implies 1 = 2b \\implies b = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting $b = 1/2$ into the second equation gives:\n$$\n2 = m + \\frac{1}{2} \\implies m = 2 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}\n$$\nSo the transformation is $x(t) = \\frac{3}{2}t + \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nNow, we transform the nodal polynomial $\\omega(x)$ into a new polynomial in the variable $t$.\nThe factors of $\\omega(x)$ become:\n$$\nx + 1 = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}t + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 1 = \\frac{3}{2}t + \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}(t + 1)\n$$\n$$\nx - 2 = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}t + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) - 2 = \\frac{3}{2}t - \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}(t - 1)\n$$\nThe middle node $x_1=a$ must also be transformed.

Its local extrema lie between these roots. For the maximum absolute value to be minimized, the magnitudes of the two local extrema must be equal.\n\nLet's analyze the function $\\omega_t(t, a') = (t^2 - 1)(t - a')$.\nThe function $t^2-1$ is an even function of $t$. The term $t-a'$ controls the symmetry of the product.\nIf we choose $a' = 0$, the function becomes $\\omega_t(t, 0) = t(t^2-1) = t^3 - t$. This is an odd function.\nThe local extrema of an odd function symmetric about the origin (as this one is) will have equal and opposite values, meaning their absolute values are equal. To find these extrema, we compute the derivative and set it to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(t^3 - t) = 3t^2 - 1 = 0 \\implies t = \\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\nThe values at these extrema are:\n$\\omega_t(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}) = (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})^3 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{3}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = -\\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{3}}$\n$\\omega_t(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}) = (-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})^3 - (-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}) = -\\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{3}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{3}}$\nThe magnitudes are indeed equal.\n\nIf we choose $a' \\neq 0$, the symmetry is broken. For example, if $a' > 0$, the root at $a'$ shifts to the right. This will cause the local minimum (between $-1$ and $a'$) to become larger in magnitude, while the local maximum (between $a'$ and $1$) becomes smaller in magnitude. Thus, the maximum of the two magnitudes will be larger than for the $a'=0$ case. A symmetric argument holds for $a'  0$. Therefore, the minimum of the maximum absolute values of $\\omega_t(t)$ is achieved when $a'=0$.\n\nThe optimal value for the transformed node is $a' = 0$.\nNow we transform this value back to the original $x$-domain to find the optimal $a$.\nUsing the relation $a = \\frac{3}{2}a' + \\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$\na = \\frac{3}{2}(0) + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThus, the optimal placement of the middle node is at $a = 1/2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "2169678"}]}
