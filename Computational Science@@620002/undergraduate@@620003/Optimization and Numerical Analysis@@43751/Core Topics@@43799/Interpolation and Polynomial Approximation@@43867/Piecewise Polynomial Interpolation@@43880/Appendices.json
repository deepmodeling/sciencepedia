Consider the function $f(x) = x^4$ defined on the interval $[-1, 1]$. We wish to approximate this function using a continuous piecewise linear interpolant, which we denote as $L(x)$. This interpolant is constructed using the nodes $x_0 = -1$, $x_1 = 0$, and $x_2 = 1$. The interpolation error on a given subinterval is defined as the maximum absolute difference between the function and its interpolant on that subinterval, i.e., $\\max |f(x) - L(x)|$.\n\nYour task is to determine on which of the two subintervals, $[-1, 0]$ or $[0, 1]$, the interpolation error is largest.\n\nSelect the correct statement from the options below.\n\nA.

There is insufficient information to determine the result.", "solution": "The problem asks us to construct a piecewise linear interpolant $L(x)$ for the function $f(x) = x^4$ on the interval $[-1, 1]$ using nodes at $x = -1, 0, 1$, and then to compare the maximum interpolation error on the subintervals $[-1, 0]$ and $[0, 1]$.\n\nFirst, we evaluate the function $f(x)$ at the given nodes:\n$f(x_0) = f(-1) = (-1)^4 = 1$\n$f(x_1) = f(0) = 0^4 = 0$\n$f(x_2) = f(1) = 1^4 = 1$\n\nNow, we construct the linear interpolant for each subinterval.\n\n**Subinterval 1: $[-1, 0]$**\nThe linear interpolant, let's call it $L_1(x)$, is the line passing through the points $(x_0, f(x_0)) = (-1, 1)$ and $(x_1, f(x_1)) = (0, 0)$.\nThe slope of this line is $m_1 = \\frac{f(x_1) - f(x_0)}{x_1 - x_0} = \\frac{0 - 1}{0 - (-1)} = -1$.\nUsing the point-slope form with the point $(0, 0)$, the equation of the line is:\n$L_1(x) - 0 = -1(x - 0)$, which simplifies to $L_1(x) = -x$.\n\nThe error function on this subinterval is $E_1(x) = f(x) - L_1(x) = x^4 + x$.\nTo find the maximum absolute error, we need to find the extrema of $E_1(x)$ on $[-1, 0]$. We take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it to zero:\n$E_1'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^4 + x) = 4x^3 + 1$.\nSetting $E_1'(x) = 0$ gives $4x^3 = -1$, so $x^3 = -1/4$.\nThe critical point is $x_c = \\sqrt[3]{-1/4} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{4}}$.\nTo confirm this value is in the interval $[-1, 0]$, we note that since $1  4  8$, we have $1  \\sqrt[3]{4}  2$. Taking the reciprocal gives $1/2  1/\\sqrt[3]{4}  1$, and multiplying by -1 yields $-1  -1/\\sqrt[3]{4}  -1/2$. Thus, the critical point is indeed in the interval $[-1, 0]$.\nThe error at the endpoints of the interval (the nodes) is zero by construction: $E_1(-1) = (-1)^4 + (-1) = 0$ and $E_1(0) = 0^4 + 0 = 0$.\nThe maximum absolute error must therefore occur at the critical point $x_c$.\nThe error at this point is:\n$E_1(x_c) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{4}}\\right)^4 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{4}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4\\sqrt[3]{4}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{4}} = \\frac{1 - 4}{4\\sqrt[3]{4}} = -\\frac{3}{4\\sqrt[3]{4}}$.\nThe maximum absolute error on $[-1, 0]$ is $|E_1(x_c)| = \\frac{3}{4\\sqrt[3]{4}}$.\n\n**Subinterval 2: $[0, 1]$**\nThe linear interpolant, let's call it $L_2(x)$, is the line passing through the points $(x_1, f(x_1)) = (0, 0)$ and $(x_2, f(x_2)) = (1, 1)$.\nThe slope of this line is $m_2 = \\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{1 - 0}{1 - 0} = 1$.\nUsing the point-slope form with the point $(0, 0)$, the equation of the line is:\n$L_2(x) - 0 = 1(x - 0)$, which simplifies to $L_2(x) = x$.\n\nThe error function on this subinterval is $E_2(x) = f(x) - L_2(x) = x^4 - x$.\nTo find the maximum absolute error, we find the extrema of $E_2(x)$ on $[0, 1]$. We take the derivative:\n$E_2'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^4 - x) = 4x^3 - 1$.\nSetting $E_2'(x) = 0$ gives $4x^3 = 1$, so $x^3 = 1/4$.\nThe critical point is $x_d = \\sqrt[3]{1/4} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{4}}$.\nThis value lies in the interval $[0, 1]$.\nThe error at the endpoints is zero: $E_2(0) = 0^4 - 0 = 0$ and $E_2(1) = 1^4 - 1 = 0$.\nThe maximum absolute error must occur at the critical point $x_d$.\nThe error at this point is:\n$E_2(x_d) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{4}}\\right)^4 - \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{4}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4\\sqrt[3]{4}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{4}} = \\frac{1 - 4}{4\\sqrt[3]{4}} = -\\frac{3}{4\\sqrt[3]{4}}$.\nThe maximum absolute error on $[0, 1]$ is $|E_2(x_d)| = \\frac{3}{4\\sqrt[3]{4}}$.\n\n**Comparison**\nThe maximum absolute error on $[-1, 0]$ is $\\frac{3}{4\\sqrt[3]{4}}$.\nThe maximum absolute error on $[0, 1]$ is $\\frac{3}{4\\sqrt[3]{4}}$.\nThe maximum errors on both subintervals are identical.\n\n**Alternative Reasoning using Symmetry**\nThe function $f(x)=x^4$ is an even function, meaning $f(x) = f(-x)$.\nThe nodes are placed symmetrically about $x=0$.\nThe piecewise linear interpolant is $L(x) = -x$ for $x \\in [-1, 0]$ and $L(x) = x$ for $x \\in [0, 1]$. This can be written compactly as $L(x) = |x|$.\nThe function $L(x) = |x|$ is also an even function.\nThe error function $E(x) = f(x) - L(x) = x^4 - |x|$ is the difference of two even functions, which is also an even function.\nFor an even function $E(x)$, the value of $|E(x)|$ is the same as $|E(-x)|$. This means the error distribution is symmetric about $x=0$. Therefore, the maximum error on the interval $[-1, 0]$ must be equal to the maximum error on the interval $[0, 1]$.\n\nBased on both methods of analysis, the maximum error is identical on both subintervals. This corresponds to option C. Option D is incorrect because the error at the node $x=0$ is, by definition of interpolation, zero, which is the minimum error, not the maximum.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2193842"}, {"introduction": "While linear interpolation is useful, its sharp corners or \"kinks\" are undesirable in many applications that require smoothness.
