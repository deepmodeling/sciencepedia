This problem provides a direct, hands-on application of building a Hermite polynomial from the ground up [@problem_id:2177524].", "problem": "A path planning algorithm for a self-driving car is designed to execute a lane change maneuver. The car's lateral displacement from the centerline of its original lane is described by a function $y(t)$, where $t$ is the time elapsed since the maneuver began. The entire maneuver takes a total time $T$ to complete.\n\nThe design specifications for the maneuver are as follows:\n1.  At the start of the maneuver ($t=0$), the car is at the centerline of its original lane.\n2.  At the start of the maneuver ($t=0$), the car is traveling parallel to the lane lines, meaning its initial lateral velocity is zero.\n3.  At the end of the maneuver ($t=T$), the car is at the centerline of the adjacent lane, which is a lateral distance $W$ away.\n4.  At the end of the maneuver ($t=T$), the car is again traveling parallel to the lane lines, so its final lateral velocity is also zero.\n\nTo ensure a smooth transition, the algorithm models the path $y(t)$ using the unique cubic polynomial that satisfies these four conditions.
