Let's verify this for the initial interval $[0, 1]$.\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the function at the endpoints $a=0$ and $b=1$.\nFor $x=a=0$:\n$$f(0) = (0)^5 + (0) - 1 = -1$$\nFor $x=b=1$:\n$$f(1) = (1)^5 + (1) - 1 = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1$$\nSince $f(0) = -1$ (negative) and $f(1) = 1$ (positive), the signs are opposite, and we can confirm that at least one root lies within the interval $[0, 1]$.\n\nStep 2: Perform one iteration of the bisection method.

They have the same sign.\n- Comparing $[c, b] = [0.5, 1]$: $f(0.5)$ is negative and $f(1)$ is positive. They have opposite signs.\n\nTherefore, the root must lie in the interval $[0.5, 1]$.
