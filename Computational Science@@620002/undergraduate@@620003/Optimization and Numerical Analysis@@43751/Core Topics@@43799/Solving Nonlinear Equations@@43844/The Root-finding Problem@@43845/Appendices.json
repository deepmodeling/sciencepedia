This means that starting with $x_0=a$, we get $x_1=b$, and then $x_2=a$, and so on. Mathematically, this is described by the system of equations:\n1. $b = N(a)$\n2. $a = N(b)$\n3. $a \\neq b$\n\nUsing the expression for $N(x)$, we can write this system as:\n1. $b = \\frac{2a^3 - 2}{3a^2 - 2}$\n2. $a = \\frac{2b^3 - 2}{3b^2 - 2}$\n\nThese can be rewritten as:\n1. $b(3a^2 - 2) = 2a^3 - 2$\n2. $a(3b^2 - 2) = 2b^3 - 2$\n\nWhich expands to:\n1. $3a^2b - 2b = 2a^3 - 2$\n2. $3ab^2 - 2a = 2b^3 - 2$\n\nTo solve this system, we can subtract the second equation from the first:\n$(3a^2b - 2b) - (3ab^2 - 2a) = (2a^3 - 2) - (2b^3 - 2)$\n$3ab(a - b) + 2(a - b) = 2(a^3 - b^3)$\n\nSince the points are distinct, $a \\neq b$, so $(a-b) \\neq 0$. We can divide the entire equation by $(a-b)$:\n$3ab + 2 = 2 \\frac{a^3 - b^3}{a - b}$\nUsing the identity $a^3 - b^3 = (a-b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$, we get:\n$3ab + 2 = 2(a^2 + ab + b^2)$\n$3ab + 2 = 2a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2$\nRearranging the terms, we find a relationship between $a$ and $b$:\n$$2a^2 - ab + 2b^2 - 2 = 0$$\n\nLet $S = a+b$ and $P = ab$.

This means $(S-1)$ is a factor of the polynomial.\nUsing polynomial division, we find:\n$(S-1)(2S^2 + 2S - 5) = 0$.\nThe roots for $S$ are $S=1$ and the roots of $2S^2+2S-5=0$. Let's focus on the simple root $S=1$.\n\nIf $S = a+b = 1$, we can find the corresponding product $P = ab$:\n$P = \\frac{2S^2 - 2}{5} = \\frac{2(1)^2 - 2}{5} = \\frac{0}{5} = 0$.\nSo we have $a+b=1$ and $ab=0$.

They are distinct, as required.\n\nThe problem asks for a non-zero initial guess $x_0$ that starts this cycle. We can choose either point of the cycle as the initial guess. If we choose $x_0=0$, the next iterate is $x_1=1$. If we choose $x_0=1$, the next iterate is $x_1=0$.\nSince the problem asks for a non-zero value for $x_0$, we select $x_0=1$.\n\nLet's verify this result.\nIf $x_0=1$:\n$x_1 = N(1) = \\frac{2(1)^3 - 2}{3(1)^2 - 2} = \\frac{2-2}{3-2} = \\frac{0}{1} = 0$.\nNow we compute the next iterate, $x_2$, from $x_1=0$:\n$x_2 = N(0) = \\frac{2(0)^3 - 2}{3(0)^2 - 2} = \\frac{-2}{-2} = 1$.\nSince $x_2=x_0=1$, the sequence is $1, 0, 1, 0, \\dots$, which is a 2-cycle.\nTherefore, a valid non-zero initial guess is 1.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2219740"}]}
