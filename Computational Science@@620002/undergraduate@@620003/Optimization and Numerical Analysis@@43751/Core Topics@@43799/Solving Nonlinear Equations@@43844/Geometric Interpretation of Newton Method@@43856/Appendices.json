By analyzing a function that is both increasing ($f'(x) \\gt 0$) and convex ($f''(x) \\gt 0$), you will discover why the iterates consistently improve upon an initial guess without overshooting the target, a property known as monotonic convergence [@problem_id:2176248].", "problem": "Let $f(x)$ be a twice-differentiable function defined on an open interval $I$.
