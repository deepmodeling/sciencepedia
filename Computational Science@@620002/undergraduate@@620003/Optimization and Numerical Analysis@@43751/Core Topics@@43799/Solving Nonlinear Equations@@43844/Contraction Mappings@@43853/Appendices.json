The process operates in discrete time steps, or cycles. At the start of each cycle $n$ (where $n=0, 1, 2, \\dots$), the concentration level of the chemical is denoted by $x_n$. At the end of the cycle, three-quarters of the mixture is removed and replaced with a pure solvent. Subsequently, a fixed amount of the chemical is added to the reactor, which increases the concentration level by a value of 2. The concentration level for the next cycle, $x_{n+1}$, is then measured. This process can be described by the recurrence relation $x_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{4}x_n + 2$.\n\nIf the reactor initially starts with pure solvent, meaning the concentration level at the start of cycle 0 is $x_0 = 0$, determine the concentration levels at the start of the first four cycles: $x_0, x_1, x_2$, and $x_3$.\n\nProvide your answer as a list of four numbers corresponding to the values of $x_0, x_1, x_2$, and $x_3$.", "solution": "We are given the linear recurrence\n$$\nx_{n+1}=\\frac{1}{4}x_{n}+2\n$$\nwith initial condition $x_{0}=0$.
