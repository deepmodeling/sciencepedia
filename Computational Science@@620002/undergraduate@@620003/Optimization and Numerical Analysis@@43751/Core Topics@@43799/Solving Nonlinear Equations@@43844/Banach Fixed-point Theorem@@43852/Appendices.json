The core idea is to rearrange an equation of the form $f(x)=0$ into an equivalent form $x=g(x)$. A solution to this second equation is called a fixed point of the function $g$.\n\nThe Banach Fixed-Point Theorem provides conditions under which this iteration is guaranteed to succeed. It states that if a function $g(x)$ is a contraction mapping on a closed interval $I=[a,b]$ and it maps the interval into itself (i.e., for every $x \\in I$, $g(x)$ is also in $I$), then $g(x)$ has a unique fixed point in $I$.
