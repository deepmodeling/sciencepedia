The general form of Euler's method for an ODE of the form $y'(t) = f(t, y)$ is:\n$$y_{n+1} = y_n + h f(t_n, y_n)$$\nIn our case, the ODE is $y'(t) = -10y(t)$, so the function is $f(t, y) = -10y$. Substituting this into the Euler formula gives:\n$$y_{n+1} = y_n + h(-10y_n)$$\n\nNext, we can factor out $y_n$ to establish a recurrence relation for the sequence $\\{y_n\\}$:\n$$y_{n+1} = y_n (1 - 10h)$$\nThis equation shows that each term in the sequence is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant factor of $(1 - 10h)$. This is the formula for a geometric progression. We can write an explicit formula for $y_n$ in terms of the initial value $y_0$:\n$$y_n = y_0 (1 - 10h)^n$$\n\nThe problem provides the initial condition $y(0) = 1$, which means $y_0 = 1$. Substituting this into our explicit formula, we get:\n$$y_n = (1 - 10h)^n$$\n\nThe problem defines a non-oscillatory sequence as one where all terms $y_n$ are non-negative, since $y_0$ is positive. For $y_n = (1-10h)^n$ to be non-negative for all $n \\ge 1$, the base of the power, $(1-10h)$, must be non-negative.\nIf $(1-10h)$ were negative, say $(1-10h) = -c$ where $c>0$, then the sequence would be $y_1 = -c$, $y_2 = (-c)^2 = c^2$, $y_3 = (-c)^3 = -c^3$, and so on. The signs of the terms would alternate $(-, +, -, \\dots)$, which is the oscillatory behavior we need to avoid.\nTherefore, the condition for a non-oscillatory sequence is:\n$$1 - 10h \\ge 0$$\n\nNow, we solve this inequality for the step size $h$:\n$$1 \\ge 10h$$\n$$\\frac{1}{10} \\ge h$$\nSo, $h \\le 0.1$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the step size $h$ must be positive, so we have $h > 0$. Combining these conditions, the set of all positive step sizes $h$ for which the sequence $\\{y_n\\}$ is non-oscillatory is given by the interval $(0, 0.1]$.\n\nFinally, the question asks for the supremum of this set. The supremum is the least upper bound of the set.
