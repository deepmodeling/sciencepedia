Which of the following statements provides the correct and most specific physical and mathematical reasoning to reconcile this apparent paradox?\n\nA. The trapezoidal rule is known to be exact for any odd function when integrated over an interval that is symmetric about the origin, and $f(x)=x^3$ is an odd function.\n\nB.

The actual error can be anywhere between zero and this bound, and for this problem, it just happens to be zero by coincidence.\n\nD. The composite error is the sum of errors from each subinterval. The derivation of the simplified global error bound formula implicitly assumes that the second derivative does not change sign in a way that allows for systematic cancellation. For the symmetric subintervals $[-a, 0]$ and $[0, a]$, the error contribution from the first interval is exactly canceled by the error from the second, due to the odd symmetry of the second derivative, $f''(x)=6x$.\n\nE. The error bound formula provided is only valid for functions whose second derivative is non-negative over the interval of integration, a condition which $f(x)=x^3$ violates on $[-a, a]$.", "solution": "First, compute the exact value of the integral.

The composite error is a sum of local errors. For $f(x)=x^{3}$, the second derivative $f''(x)=6x$ is an odd function.
