We calculate it as follows:\n$$ \\Delta x = \\frac{b-a}{n} = \\frac{4-0}{4} = 1 $$\n\nThe interval $[0, 4]$ is thus divided into $n=4$ subintervals, each of width $\\Delta x = 1$.

Let's identify these right endpoints, which we can denote as $x_i$ for $i=1, 2, 3, 4$.\nFor the first subinterval $[0, 1]$, the right endpoint is $x_1 = 1$.\nFor the second subinterval $[1, 2]$, the right endpoint is $x_2 = 2$.\nFor the third subinterval $[2, 3]$, the right endpoint is $x_3 = 3$.\nFor the fourth subinterval $[3, 4]$, the right endpoint is $x_4 = 4$.\n\nThe volume of a single thin cylindrical disk is given by the formula $V_{\\text{disk}} = \\pi (\\text{radius})^2 (\\text{thickness})$.\nFor the $i$-th disk in our approximation, the radius is $R_i = f(x_i) = \\sqrt{x_i}$, and the thickness is $\\Delta x$.\nTherefore, the volume of the $i$-th disk is $V_i = \\pi [f(x_i)]^2 \\Delta x$.\nSubstituting the function $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$, we get:\n$$ V_i = \\pi (\\sqrt{x_i})^2 \\Delta x = \\pi x_i \\Delta x $$\n\nNow, we calculate the volume for each of the four disks using their respective right endpoints and $\\Delta x = 1$:\nThe volume of the first disk, $V_1$ (using $x_1=1$):\n$$ V_1 = \\pi (x_1) \\Delta x = \\pi (1) (1) = \\pi $$\nThe volume of the second disk, $V_2$ (using $x_2=2$):\n$$ V_2 = \\pi (x_2) \\Delta x = \\pi (2) (1) = 2\\pi $$\nThe volume of the third disk, $V_3$ (using $x_3=3$):\n$$ V_3 = \\pi (x_3) \\Delta x = \\pi (3) (1) = 3\\pi $$\nThe volume of the fourth disk, $V_4$ (using $x_4=4$):\n$$ V_4 = \\pi (x_4) \\Delta x = \\pi (4) (1) = 4\\pi $$\n\nThe total approximate volume, $V_{\\text{approx}}$, is the sum of the volumes of these four disks:\n$$ V_{\\text{approx}} = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 + V_4 = \\pi + 2\\pi + 3\\pi + 4\\pi = 10\\pi $$\n\nThis calculation is a right Riemann sum for the volume integral $V = \\int_{0}^{4} \\pi [f(x)]^2 dx$:\n$$ V_{\\text{approx}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\pi [f(x_i)]^2 \\Delta x = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\pi x_i \\Delta x = \\pi \\Delta x \\sum_{i=1}^{4} x_i $$\nWith $\\Delta x = 1$ and $x_i = i$, this becomes:\n$$ V_{\\text{approx}} = \\pi (1) (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) = \\pi (10) = 10\\pi $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10\\pi}$$", "id": "2198231"}, {"introduction": "While Riemann sums provide a way to approximate an integral, a crucial question for any numerical method is: \"How good is the approximation?\" This practice moves beyond simple calculation to an analysis of error and convergence [@problem_id:2198211].
