The process is carried out slowly, so it can be considered quasi-static and isothermal. The force $F$ required to hold the piston at a position $x$ (measured from the closed end of the cylinder) is found to vary according to the law $F(x) = \\frac{k}{x}$, where $k$ is a constant related to the temperature and the amount of gas.\n\nTo move the piston and compress the gas, work must be done. The exact work $W$ done by an external agent to move the piston from an initial position $x_i$ to a final position $x_f$ is given by the integral $W = \\int_{x_i}^{x_f} F(x) dx$.\n\nSuppose the piston is moved from $x_i = 1$ m to $x_f = 3$ m, and the constant $k$ is equal to 1 N路m. You are tasked with finding an approximate value for the work done. The approximation method consists of the following steps:\n1. Divide the total displacement interval $[x_i, x_f]$ into two subintervals of equal length.\n2. For each subinterval, approximate the area under the force-displacement curve by the area of a trapezoid formed by the x-axis, the vertical lines at the subinterval's endpoints, and the straight line segment connecting the force values at these endpoints.\n3.
