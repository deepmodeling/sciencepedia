Present your answer as an ordered pair of numerical values $(Z_{P}^*, Z_{D}^*)$.", "solution": "**Part 1: Formulate and Solve the Primal Problem**\n\nFirst, we formulate the primal linear programming problem (P) based on the information given.\nLet $x_1$ be the number of units of Product A and $x_2$ be the number of units of Product B.\nThe objective is to maximize the total profit, $Z_P$. The profit function is:\n$$Z_P = 3x_1 + 5x_2$$\nThe constraints are based on the available resources (labor and materials).\nLabor constraint: $1x_1 + 2x_2 \\le 10$\nMaterial constraint: $3x_1 + 1x_2 \\le 15$\nAdditionally, the number of units produced cannot be negative:\n$x_1 \\ge 0$, $x_2 \\ge 0$\n\nSo, the primal problem (P) is:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Maximize } & Z_P = 3x_1 + 5x_2 \\\\\n\\text{subject to } & x_1 + 2x_2 \\le 10 \\\\\n& 3x_1 + x_2 \\le 15 \\\\\n& x_1, x_2 \\ge 0\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nWe solve this problem graphically. We plot the boundary lines of the constraints in the first quadrant:\n1. $x_1 + 2x_2 = 10$ (passes through $(10,0)$ and $(0,5)$)\n2. $3x_1 + x_2 = 15$ (passes through $(5,0)$ and $(0,15)$)\n3. $x_1 = 0$ (the vertical axis)\n4. $x_2 = 0$ (the horizontal axis)\n\nThe feasible region is the polygon defined by the vertices where these lines intersect. The vertices are:\n- Vertex O: Intersection of $x_1=0$ and $x_2=0$, which is $(0,0)$.\n- Vertex A: Intersection of $x_1=0$ and $x_1 + 2x_2 = 10$, which gives $2x_2 = 10 \\implies x_2 = 5$. So, A is $(0,5)$.\n- Vertex B: Intersection of $x_2=0$ and $3x_1 + x_2 = 15$, which gives $3x_1 = 15 \\implies x_1 = 5$. So, B is $(5,0)$.\n- Vertex C: Intersection of $x_1 + 2x_2 = 10$ and $3x_1 + x_2 = 15$. From the second equation, $x_2 = 15 - 3x_1$. Substituting this into the first equation:\n$x_1 + 2(15 - 3x_1) = 10$\n$x_1 + 30 - 6x_1 = 10$\n$-5x_1 = -20 \\implies x_1 = 4$\nThen, $x_2 = 15 - 3(4) = 15 - 12 = 3$. So, C is $(4,3)$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the objective function $Z_P = 3x_1 + 5x_2$ at each vertex:\n- At O(0,0): $Z_P = 3(0) + 5(0) = 0$\n- At A(0,5): $Z_P = 3(0) + 5(5) = 25$\n- At B(5,0): $Z_P = 3(5) + 5(0) = 15$\n- At C(4,3): $Z_P = 3(4) + 5(3) = 12 + 15 = 27$\n\nThe maximum value of the objective function is 27, which occurs at $(x_1, x_2) = (4,3)$.\nSo, the optimal value for the primal problem is $Z_{P}^* = 27$.\n\n**Part 2: Formulate and Solve the Dual Problem**\n\nNext, we formulate the dual problem (D). The primal is a maximization problem with '$\\le$' constraints. Its dual will be a minimization problem with '$\\ge$' constraints. Let $y_1$ and $y_2$ be the dual variables associated with the labor and material constraints, respectively.\n\nThe dual problem (D) is:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Minimize } & Z_D = 10y_1 + 15y_2 \\\\\n\\text{subject to } & y_1 + 3y_2 \\ge 3 \\\\\n& 2y_1 + y_2 \\ge 5 \\\\\n& y_1, y_2 \\ge 0\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nWe can also solve this dual problem graphically. We plot the boundary lines of the dual constraints:\n1. $y_1 + 3y_2 = 3$ (passes through $(3,0)$ and $(0,1)$)\n2. $2y_1 + y_2 = 5$ (passes through $(2.5,0)$ and $(0,5)$)\n\nThe feasible region is unbounded above and to the right. Since this is a minimization problem, the optimal solution must lie at one of the vertices of the boundary of the feasible region. The vertices are:\n- Vertex P: Intersection of $y_1=0$ and $2y_1 + y_2 = 5$, giving $y_2 = 5$. So, P is $(0,5)$.\n- Vertex Q: Intersection of $y_2=0$ and $y_1 + 3y_2 = 3$, giving $y_1 = 3$. So, Q is $(3,0)$.\n- Vertex R: Intersection of $y_1 + 3y_2 = 3$ and $2y_1 + y_2 = 5$. From the second equation, $y_2 = 5 - 2y_1$. Substituting into the first:\n$y_1 + 3(5 - 2y_1) = 3$\n$y_1 + 15 - 6y_1 = 3$\n$-5y_1 = -12 \\implies y_1 = \\frac{12}{5}$\nThen, $y_2 = 5 - 2(\\frac{12}{5}) = 5 - \\frac{24}{5} = \\frac{25-24}{5} = \\frac{1}{5}$. So, R is $(\\frac{12}{5}, \\frac{1}{5})$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the dual objective function $Z_D = 10y_1 + 15y_2$ at each vertex:\n- At P(0,5): $Z_D = 10(0) + 15(5) = 75$\n- At Q(3,0): $Z_D = 10(3) + 15(0) = 30$\n- At R($\\frac{12}{5}, \\frac{1}{5}$): $Z_D = 10(\\frac{12}{5}) + 15(\\frac{1}{5}) = 2(12) + 3(1) = 24 + 3 = 27$\n\nThe minimum value of the dual objective function is 27.\nSo, the optimal value for the dual problem is $Z_{D}^* = 27$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe optimal objective value for the primal problem is $Z_{P}^* = 27$, and the optimal objective value for the dual problem is $Z_{D}^* = 27$. As expected from the Strong Duality Theorem, the optimal values are equal.\nThe requested ordered pair is $(Z_{P}^*, Z_{D}^*) = (27, 27)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 27 & 27 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2167651"}, {"introduction": "Once we establish that the primal and dual problems have the same optimal value, how can we check if a proposed solution is indeed optimal without re-solving the entire problem?
