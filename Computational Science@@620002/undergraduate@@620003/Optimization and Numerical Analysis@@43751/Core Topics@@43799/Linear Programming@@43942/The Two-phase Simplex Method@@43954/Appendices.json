To set up Phase I for the two-phase simplex method, we convert all constraints to equalities by introducing slack or surplus variables, and introduce artificial variables only when necessary to form an initial basic feasible solution.\n\nPrinciples for variable introduction:\n- For a constraint of type $\\le$, we add a slack variable with coefficient $+1$ to convert it to equality. This slack variable can serve as an initial basic variable, and no artificial variable is needed.\n- For a constraint of type $\\ge$, we subtract a surplus variable with coefficient $-1$ to convert it to equality. Because the resulting column does not provide a basic variable, we must also add an artificial variable to form the initial basis.\n\nApplying these rules:\n- For the single $\\le$ constraint: add $1$ slack variable; no artificial variable is required.\n- For each of the two $\\ge$ constraints: add $1$ surplus variable and $1$ artificial variable per constraint, totaling $2$ surplus and $2$ artificial variables.\n\nCounting all variables in the Phase I tableau:\n- Original decision variables: $5$.\n- Slack variables: $1$.\n- Surplus variables: $2$.\n- Artificial variables: $2$.\nTherefore, the total number of variables in Phase I is $5 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 10$.\n\nThe order $m$ of the square basis matrix equals the number of basic variables required for the initial basis, which matches the number of functional constraints after conversion to equalities. There are $3$ constraints, thus $m = 3$. Concretely, the initial basic variables can be chosen as the $1$ slack variable from the $\\le$ constraint and the $2$ artificial variables from the $\\ge$ constraints, totaling $3$ basics.\n\nHence, the requested values are the total number of variables $10$ and the basis order $m=3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}10 & 3\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2222351"}, {"introduction": "Once the initial Phase I tableau is correctly set up, the core of the method is an iterative process of pivoting towards a feasible solution.
