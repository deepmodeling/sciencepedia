Let $x_1, x_2, x_3$ represent the duration (in hours) for which each process is run. The total energy consumption, which the plant seeks to minimize, is a linear function of these durations. The objective function to minimize is $E = 4x_1 + 3x_2 + 5x_3$ in units of megawatt-hours (MWh).\n\nFor the chip to function correctly, two quality control specifications must be met. These relate to the minimum required concentration of two types of dopants, P-type and N-type, which are functions of the process durations.\n1.  P-type dopant concentration constraint: $2x_1 + x_2 + 3x_3 \\ge 10$ (in arbitrary concentration units)\n2.  N-type dopant concentration constraint: $x_1 + 2x_2 + x_3 \\ge 12$ (in arbitrary concentration units)\n3.  The durations must be non-negative: $x_1, x_2, x_3 \\ge 0$.\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem using the dual simplex method, you must first set up the initial tableau. The standard form for this method requires converting the `≥` inequalities to `≤` inequalities before adding slack variables ($s_1, s_2$) to form equalities. The tableau should be arranged with the objective function row first, followed by the rows for the two constraints. The columns should represent the variables in the order $x_1, x_2, x_3, s_1, s_2$.\n\nDetermine the location of the first pivot element that would be chosen according to the rules of the dual simplex algorithm. Express your answer as a pair of integers `(row index, column index)`. These indices refer to the position within the matrix of coefficients corresponding to the constraints (i.e., excluding the objective row and the solution/RHS column).
