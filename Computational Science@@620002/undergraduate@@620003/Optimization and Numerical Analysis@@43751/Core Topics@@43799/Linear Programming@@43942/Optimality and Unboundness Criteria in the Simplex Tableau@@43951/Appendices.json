{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The first step in analyzing any simplex tableau is to determine if the current basic feasible solution is optimal. This critical judgment rests on the coefficients of the non-basic variables in the objective function row, often called reduced costs. This exercise challenges you to apply the correct optimality criterion for a maximization problem and to distinguish it from misleading information in the tableau, such as the presence of a degenerate basic variable, which is a basic variable with a value of zero [@problem_id:2192542].", "problem": "In an optimization class, a student is using the simplex method to solve a linear programming problem involving the maximization of an objective function $Z$. The variables $x_1$ and $x_2$ are decision variables, while $s_1$ and $s_2$ are slack variables. After several iterations, the student arrives at the following simplex tableau:\n\n| Basis | $Z$ | $x_1$ | $x_2$ | $s_1$ | $s_2$ | RHS |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| $Z$ | 1 | -2 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 15 |\n| $x_2$ | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 5 |\n| $s_2$ | 0 | 2 | 0 | -2 | 1 | 0 |\n\nBased on this tableau, analyze the state of the solution and select the most accurate statement from the choices below.\n\nA.

The solution is not optimal because there is a negative coefficient in the objective row for a non-basic variable.\n\nD.

The non-basic variables are $x_{1}=0$ and $s_{1}=0$. The current basic feasible solution is therefore $(x_{1},x_{2},s_{1},s_{2})=(0,5,0,0)$, and degeneracy is present because $s_{2}=0$ while basic.\n\nFor a maximization problem, the simplex method is at an optimal solution when all coefficients for non-basic variables in the objective row are non-negative. In the given tableau, the objective row represents the equation $Z - 2x_1 + 3s_1 = 15$. The coefficients for the non-basic variables $x_1$ and $s_1$ are -2 and 3, respectively.\n\nThe coefficient under the non-basic variable $x_1$ is $-2$, which is negative. This indicates that the current solution is not optimal because increasing $x_1$ will increase the objective function value $Z$.\n\nTo rule out unboundedness, we apply the minimum ratio test to the entering column $x_{1}$. The column for $x_1$ has entries $1$ (in the $x_2$ row) and $2$ (in the $s_2$ row). Since there are positive entries in this column, a leaving variable can be determined, and the problem is not unbounded. The ratios are $5/1=5$ and $0/2=0$. A valid leaving variable exists (here $s_2$).\n\nStatements about optimality due to a basic variable being zero are incorrect: a zero-valued basic variable indicates degeneracy, which is allowed and does not imply optimality or invalidity of the tableau.\n\nHence, the correct choice is that the solution is not optimal because there is a negative coefficient in the objective row for a non-basic variable.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2192542"}, {"introduction": "When a solution is not optimal, the simplex algorithm proceeds to find a better one. However, in some cases, the objective function can be improved indefinitely. This practice focuses on identifying the specific signature of an unbounded problem within the simplex tableau, which occurs when an entering variable can be increased without limit while maintaining feasibility [@problem_id:2192487]. Understanding this condition is crucial for correctly terminating the algorithm and interpreting the nature of the model's solution space.", "problem": "Consider a linear programming problem in standard form aimed at maximization, being solved using the simplex method. The current simplex tableau is organized such that row 0 represents the objective function ($z$) and rows 1, 2, and 3 represent the constraints. The objective function has been formulated as $z - \\sum c_j x_j = 0$ and placed in row 0, meaning the reduced cost for variable $x_j$ is its coefficient in this row. The algorithm terminates with an optimal solution when all reduced costs for non-basic variables are non-negative.\n\nAt an intermediate iteration, we are inspecting the column corresponding to a single non-basic variable, $x_k$. Below are five possibilities for the column vector representing $x_k$ in the tableau. In each vector, the top element is the reduced cost from row 0, and the subsequent elements are the constraint coefficients from rows 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n\nWhich one of the following columns for the non-basic variable $x_k$, by itself, provides sufficient evidence to conclude that the maximization problem is unbounded?\n\nA.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3 \\\\\n-1 \\\\\n-4 \\\\\n-2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nB.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-5 \\\\\n2 \\\\\n-3 \\\\\n1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nC.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n-4 \\\\\n2 \\\\\n-1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nD.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-8 \\\\\n-2 \\\\\n-6 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nE.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-10 \\\\\n5 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$", "solution": "For a maximization linear program being solved by the simplex method, two conditions must be met to declare the problem unbounded. First, there must be a non-basic variable that is eligible to enter the basis, meaning its selection would improve the objective function. Second, it must be possible to increase this variable indefinitely without violating any constraints.\n\nAccording to the problem description, the objective row is formulated such that for a maximization problem, an optimal solution is reached when all reduced costs (the coefficients of the non-basic variables in row 0) are non-negative. Consequently, a variable is eligible to enter the basis if its reduced cost is negative.\n\nThe second condition, for unboundedness, relates to the constraint coefficients in the column of the entering variable. Let the entering variable be $x_k$. If all constraint coefficients in the column for $x_k$ (denoted $\\bar{a}_{ik}$) are non-positive (i.e., $\\bar{a}_{ik} \\le 0$ for all constraint rows $i$), then increasing $x_k$ will not cause any current basic variable to decrease. This means $x_k$ can be made arbitrarily large without violating the non-negativity constraints, and thus the objective function is unbounded.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n- Option A: $\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -4 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The reduced cost is $3 \\ge 0$. The variable $x_k$ is not an entering variable, so we cannot conclude unboundedness.\n- Option B: $\\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -3 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The reduced cost is $-5 < 0$, so $x_k$ is an entering variable. However, its column contains positive constraint coefficients (2 and 1). The ratio test would identify a leaving variable, so the problem is not unbounded.\n- Option C: $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -4 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The reduced cost is $0 \\ge 0$. This indicates an alternative optimal solution might exist if the tableau were optimal, but it does not improve the objective. We cannot conclude unboundedness.\n- Option D: $\\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\\\ -2 \\\\ -6 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The reduced cost is $-8 < 0$, so $x_k$ is an entering variable. All constraint coefficients in its column ($-2, -6, 0$) are non-positive. This meets both conditions for unboundedness.\n- Option E: $\\begin{pmatrix} -10 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The reduced cost is $-10 < 0$, so $x_k$ is an entering variable. However, its column contains a positive constraint coefficient (5).

The non-basic variables are those not listed in the \"Basic Variable\" column, which are $x_1$ and $s_1$. The coefficient for $x_1$ is -3, and the coefficient for $s_1$ is 2. Since there is a negative coefficient (-3) for the non-basic variable $x_1$, the current solution is not optimal. Statement (C) is incorrect.\n\n2.  **Select Entering Variable**: To improve the objective function, we must choose a non-basic variable with a negative coefficient in the objective row to enter the basis. Here, $x_1$ is the only choice with a coefficient of -3. Therefore, $x_1$ is the entering variable. Statement (D) is incorrect because the coefficient for $s_1$ is positive (2), so entering $s_1$ would decrease the objective value.\n\n3.  **Select Leaving Variable (Ratio Test)**: To find the leaving variable, we perform the minimum ratio test on the column of the entering variable, $x_1$. We look at the ratios of the Right-Hand Side (RHS) values to the positive coefficients in the $x_1$ column for the constraint rows.\n    *   Row for $x_2$: The coefficient of $x_1$ is -1. Since this is not positive, we ignore this row for the ratio test.\n    *   Row for $s_2$: The coefficient of $x_1$ is 2. This is positive. The ratio is $\\frac{\\text{RHS}}{\\text{coefficient}} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10$.\n\n    Since there is only one eligible row for the ratio test, the minimum ratio is 10, which corresponds to the row of the basic variable $s_2$.

In the column for the entering variable $x_1$, the coefficient in the $s_2$ row is 2, which is positive. Therefore, the problem is not unbounded. Statements (B) and (E) are incorrect. The presence of a negative entry in the entering column does not imply unboundedness; the condition is that *all* entries must be non-positive.\n\nBased on this analysis, the problem is not optimal, $x_1$ is the entering variable, and $s_2$ is the leaving variable.
