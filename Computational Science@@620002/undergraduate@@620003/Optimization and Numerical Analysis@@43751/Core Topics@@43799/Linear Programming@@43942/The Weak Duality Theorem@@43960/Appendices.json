A feasible production and distribution plan (a feasible solution to the primal problem) has been found that results in a total cost of $z = \\$15,750$.\n2.  A separate analysis has yielded a feasible solution for the dual problem, with a corresponding objective function value of $w = \\$16,100$.\n\nBoth solutions are claimed to be feasible for their respective problems. Assuming the principles of linear programming are correct, which of the following statements is the most accurate conclusion that can be drawn from these two reports?\n\nA. Both reports are correct, and the true optimal cost for the company is likely the average of the two values, which is $15,925.\nB. This situation is impossible. An error must have been made in at least one of the reports, as either a claimed \"feasible\" solution is actually infeasible, or an objective value has been miscalculated.\nC. The primal problem is unbounded, meaning the costs can be driven infinitely low, so the reported cost of $15,750 is not the minimum.\nD. The dual problem must be infeasible, as its objective value cannot exceed the cost of any feasible primal solution.\nE.

By weak duality, for any primal feasible $x$ and dual feasible $y$, we have $c^{T}x \\ge b^{T}y$.

The only valid conclusion is that there is an error in at least one report, either in feasibility or in the computation of the objective value. Thus, the most accurate choice is that this situation is impossible as stated.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the average of the two values has no justification in linear programming duality. Option C is incorrect because an unbounded primal (in minimization) would imply the dual is infeasible, contradicting the claim of a feasible dual. Option D is too strong; we cannot conclude the dual must be infeasibleâ€”only that the pair of reported facts is inconsistent. Option E is likewise unjustified; infeasibility of the primal is not implied merely by a lower primal value than a dual value; the contradiction arises from weak duality, not from infeasibility of one specific side.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is that an error must have occurred in at least one of the reports.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2222651"}, {"introduction": "The principles of duality are not confined to linear programming alone.
