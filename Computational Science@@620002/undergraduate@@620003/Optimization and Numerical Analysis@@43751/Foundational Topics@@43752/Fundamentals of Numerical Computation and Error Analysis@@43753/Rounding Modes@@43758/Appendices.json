To conserve power and silicon area, this processor avoids floating-point arithmetic and instead represents all sensor data using a signed 8-bit fixed-point format. This format is defined as Q3.4, which signifies that each 8-bit number includes 1 sign bit, 3 integer bits, and 4 fractional bits.\n\nA new barometric pressure sensor is calibrated to output a normalized value, which can be positive or negative. A specific reading from this sensor is $-0.3$. Before this value can be processed, it must be converted into the Q3.4 binary format. The processor's instruction set architecture provides two distinct rounding modes for this conversion:\n1.  **Truncation (Round toward Zero):** The fractional part of the number is discarded. For example, $5.9$ becomes $5$ and $-5.9$ becomes $-5$.\n2.  **Round-to-Nearest-Even (Convergent Rounding):** The number is rounded to the nearest integer. If the number is exactly halfway between two integers (e.g., has a fractional part of exactly $0.5$), it is rounded to the nearest even integer. For example, $5.5$ rounds to $6$, and $4.5$ rounds to $4$.\n\nDetermine the two 8-bit signed integer values that correspond to the binary patterns representing the sensor reading of $-0.3$ after it is converted using each of the two rounding modes.
