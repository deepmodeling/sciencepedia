You will explore how minor inaccuracies in the dimensions of a drug capsule propagate to a significant uncertainty in its total volume.", "problem": "A pharmaceutical company is designing a new drug delivery capsule. The capsule is modeled as a perfect cylinder of length $L$ with two hemispheres of radius $r$ capping its ends. The total volume of the capsule determines the dosage, so its precision is critical.\n\nThe manufacturing process involves two separate measurement devices. The radius $r$ is measured by a device with a known maximum absolute error of $\\delta_r$. The length of the cylindrical section, $L$, is measured by another device with a known maximum absolute error of $\\delta_L$.\n\nAssuming that the measurement errors for the radius and length are small and independent, derive a symbolic expression for the maximum possible absolute error, $\\delta_V$, in the calculated volume of the capsule. Your expression should be in terms of the nominal dimensions $r$ and $L$, and the measurement errors $\\delta_r$ and $\\delta_L$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the maximum possible absolute error in the volume of a capsule, given the errors in the measurement of its constituent dimensions, the radius $r$ and the length $L$. This is a problem of error propagation. For a function of multiple variables, $V(r, L)$, the total differential provides a linear approximation for the change in the function due to small changes in its variables. The maximum absolute error, $\\delta_V$, can be approximated by summing the contributions from the individual measurement errors:\n\n$$ \\delta_V \\approx \\left| \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial r} \\right| \\delta_r + \\left| \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial L} \\right| \\delta_L $$\n\nHere, $\\delta_r$ and $\\delta_L$ are the given maximum absolute errors in the measurements of $r$ and $L$.\n\nFirst, we must establish the formula for the total volume $V$ of the capsule. The capsule consists of a central cylinder and two hemispherical caps.\nThe volume of the cylindrical part is $V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 L$.\nThe two hemispherical caps together form a single sphere of radius $r$. The volume of this sphere is $V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3$.\nThe total volume $V$ is the sum of these two volumes:\n\n$$ V(r, L) = V_{\\text{cylinder}} + V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\pi r^2 L + \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 $$\n\nNext, we compute the partial derivatives of the volume $V$ with respect to the radius $r$ and the length $L$.\n\nThe partial derivative with respect to $r$ is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( \\pi r^2 L + \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 \\right) = 2 \\pi r L + \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (3r^2) = 2\\pi r L + 4\\pi r^2 $$\n\nThe partial derivative with respect to $L$ is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial L} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial L} \\left( \\pi r^2 L + \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 \\right) = \\pi r^2 $$\n\nSince $r$ and $L$ represent physical dimensions, they must be positive quantities ($r > 0$, $L > 0$). Consequently, both partial derivatives, $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial r} = 2\\pi r L + 4\\pi r^2$ and $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial L} = \\pi r^2$, are always positive. Thus, we can drop the absolute value signs around the partial derivatives in the error propagation formula.\n\nSubstituting the partial derivatives into the formula for $\\delta_V$:\n$$ \\delta_V = \\left( 2\\pi r L + 4\\pi r^2 \\right) \\delta_r + \\left( \\pi r^2 \\right) \\delta_L $$\n\nTo present the final answer in a more compact form, we can factor out common terms. We can factor out $\\pi r$ from the entire expression.\nFrom the first term, factoring out $\\pi r$ gives: $\\pi r (2L + 4r)$.\nFrom the second term, factoring out $\\pi r$ gives: $\\pi r (r)$.\n\nCombining these, we get:\n$$ \\delta_V = \\pi r (2L + 4r) \\delta_r + \\pi r^2 \\delta_L $$\nFactoring $\\pi r$ from the whole expression yields:\n$$ \\delta_V = \\pi r \\left( (2L + 4r) \\delta_r + r \\delta_L \\right) $$\n\nThis is the final expression for the maximum possible absolute error in the volume of the capsule.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\pi r \\left( (2L + 4r) \\delta_r + r \\delta_L \\right)}$$", "id": "2187593"}, {"introduction": "Even with perfect data, the finite precision of computer arithmetic can introduce significant numerical errors.
