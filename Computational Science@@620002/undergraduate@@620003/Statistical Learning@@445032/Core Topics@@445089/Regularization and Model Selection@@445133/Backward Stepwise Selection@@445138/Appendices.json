We select the variable with the largest F-statistic, which is $X_1$. The model is now $\\{X_1\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the second variable to enter.**\nThe current model is $\\{X_1\\}$ with $R^2_{old} = R^2(X_1) = 0.500$. We test adding $X_2$ or $X_3$.\n- For adding $X_2$ to $\\{X_1\\}$: $p_{full}=2$. The full model is $\\{X_1, X_2\\}$ with $R^2_{full}=0.510$.\n  $F_{X_2 | X_1} = \\frac{(R^2(X_1, X_2) - R^2(X_1)) / 1}{(1 - R^2(X_1, X_2)) / (104 - 2 - 1)} = \\frac{(0.510 - 0.500) / 1}{(1 - 0.510) / 101} = \\frac{0.010}{0.490 / 101} \\approx 2.06$\n- For adding $X_3$ to $\\{X_1\\}$: $p_{full}=2$.

Therefore, neither $X_2$ nor $X_3$ can be added to the model. The procedure terminates.\nThe final model from forward selection is $\\{X_1\\}$.\n\n**Backward Elimination Procedure**\n\nBackward elimination starts with the full model containing all predictors and removes them one at a time.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the first variable to remove from the full model.**\nThe starting model is $\\{X_1, X_2, X_3\\}$ with $R^2_{full}=0.700$ and $p_{full}=3$. We test removing each variable. The denominator for all F-tests in this step is $(1 - R^2_{full}) / (n - p_{full} - 1) = (1 - 0.700) / (104 - 3 - 1) = 0.300 / 100 = 0.003$.\n- For removing $X_1$: The reduced model is $\\{X_2, X_3\\}$ with $R^2_{reduced}=0.690$.\n  $F_{rem, X_1} = \\frac{(0.700 - 0.690) / 1}{0.003} = \\frac{0.010}{0.003} \\approx 3.33$\n- For removing $X_2$: The reduced model is $\\{X_1, X_3\\}$ with $R^2_{reduced}=0.510$.\n  $F_{rem, X_2} = \\frac{(0.700 - 0.510) / 1}{0.003} = \\frac{0.190}{0.003} \\approx 63.33$\n- For removing $X_3$: The reduced model is $\\{X_1, X_2\\}$ with $R^2_{reduced}=0.510$.\n  $F_{rem, X_3} = \\frac{(0.700 - 0.510) / 1}{0.003} = \\frac{0.190}{0.003} \\approx 63.33$\n\nWe look for any F-statistics that are less than $F_{crit}=3.94$. Only the test for removing $X_1$ results in an F-statistic ($3.33$) below the critical value. If multiple variables were candidates for removal, we would remove the one with the smallest F-statistic. Here, only $X_1$ is a candidate. So we remove $X_1$.\nThe model is now $\\{X_2, X_3\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the next variable to remove.**\nThe current model is $\\{X_2, X_3\\}$ with $R^2_{full}=0.690$ and $p_{full}=2$. We test removing the remaining variables. The denominator for the F-tests is $(1 - R^2_{full}) / (n - p_{full} - 1) = (1 - 0.690) / (104 - 2 - 1) = 0.310 / 101 \\approx 0.00307$.\n- For removing $X_2$: The reduced model is $\\{X_3\\}$ with $R^2_{reduced}=0.480$.\n  $F_{rem, X_2} = \\frac{(0.690 - 0.480) / 1}{0.310 / 101} = \\frac{0.210}{0.310 / 101} \\approx 68.42$\n- For removing $X_3$: The reduced model is $\\{X_2\\}$ with $R^2_{reduced}=0.480$.\n  $F_{rem, X_3} = \\frac{(0.690 - 0.480) / 1}{0.310 / 101} = \\frac{0.210}{0.310 / 101} \\approx 68.42$\n\nBoth of these F-statistics are much greater than $F_{crit}=3.94$. Therefore, no more variables can be removed from the model. The procedure terminates.\nThe final model from backward elimination is $\\{X_2, X_3\\}$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe forward selection procedure resulted in the model $\\{X_1\\}$. The backward elimination procedure resulted in the model $\\{X_2, X_3\\}$.

This hands-on coding exercise [@problem_id:3101321] demonstrates how backward selection can be deceived into selecting a useless 'leakage' variable. You will implement a simple detection routine based on correlation analysis and see how a leakage-aware workflow leads to a more robust and reliable model.", "problem": "You must write a complete program that constructs synthetic regression datasets and demonstrates how a naive backward stepwise selection can retain a variable that is only predictive due to data leakage, while a leakage-aware preprocessing step can detect and remove such variables before selection. The program must implement both the leakage detection and the backward stepwise selection, and must output results for a specified test suite. All computations must be expressed in purely mathematical and logical terms without external input.\n\nStart from the following foundational base:\n- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression assumes a response vector $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is generated from predictors $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}$ and an intercept via $y = \\beta_0 \\mathbf{1} + X \\beta + \\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2 I_n)$.\n- The OLS estimator minimizes the residual sum of squares (RSS), where $\\mathrm{RSS} = \\lVert y - \\hat{y} \\rVert_2^2$.\n- Under the Gaussian noise model, the maximized log-likelihood can be expressed in terms of $\\mathrm{RSS}$, and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for a model with $k$ parameters (including the intercept) and $n$ observations is $ \\mathrm{BIC} = n \\log\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{RSS}}{n}\\right) + k \\log(n)$. Lower $\\mathrm{BIC}$ indicates a preferred model.\n- Backward stepwise selection begins from a full set of candidate features and at each step evaluates removing each single remaining feature. Remove the feature whose removal yields the smallest BIC if and only if that BIC is strictly smaller than the current BIC. Repeat until no removal reduces BIC. If all features are removed, the model reduces to the intercept-only model.\n- Sample correlation between two vectors $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is the Pearson correlation, which is the covariance divided by the product of standard deviations.\n\nYour program must:\n1) Implement backward stepwise selection driven by BIC:\n   - Given $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}$ and $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, with an intercept always included (not counted among the $p$ candidate features for removal), start from all $p$ features and at each step evaluate removing each single remaining feature. Remove the feature whose removal yields the smallest BIC if and only if that BIC is strictly smaller than the current BIC. Repeat until no removal reduces BIC. If all features are removed, the model reduces to the intercept-only model.\n\n2) Implement a leakage detection routine that flags suspicious variables before selection using only $X$, $y$, and the observation index vector $t = [0, 1, \\dots, n-1]^\\top$:\n   - Rule A (direct label-copy detection): If a single feature $x_j$ has absolute correlation with $y$ greater than a high threshold $\\tau_{\\text{direct}} = 0.995$, flag $x_j$ as leakage.\n   - Rule B (time-proxy detection): If a single feature $x_j$ has absolute correlation with the time index vector $t$ greater than $\\tau_{\\text{time}} = 0.98$ and absolute correlation with $y$ greater than $\\tau_{\\text{time},y} = 0.7$, flag $x_j$ as a likely time-based leakage proxy.\n   - All thresholds $\\tau_{\\text{direct}}$, $\\tau_{\\text{time}}$, and $\\tau_{\\text{time},y}$ are fixed and must be used exactly as specified.\n\n3) For each dataset, run backward selection twice:\n   - Naive selection: on all features, without leakage removal.\n   - Leakage-aware selection: after removing all features flagged by the leakage detection routine, then applying backward selection on the remaining features.\n\n4) Return, for each dataset, a triplet containing:\n   - The list of selected feature indices after naive selection.\n   - The list of selected feature indices after leakage-aware selection.\n   - A boolean indicating whether the designated candidate leakage feature (always the last column of $X$) was flagged by the leakage detection routine.\n\nBoth index lists must refer to the original column indices of $X$ (from $0$ to $p-1$), and must be sorted in increasing order.\n\nDataset generation details (test suite):\n- For all datasets, construct $X$ by horizontally concatenating three blocks: $X = [X_{\\text{true}} \\;|\\; X_{\\text{noise}} \\;|\\; x_{\\text{leak}}]$, where $X_{\\text{true}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times q}$ are true predictors with nonzero coefficients, $X_{\\text{noise}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times r}$ are pure noise predictors, and $x_{\\text{leak}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is the designated candidate leakage feature. The true response is generated as $y = X_{\\text{true}} \\beta + \\varepsilon$ or, in the specified time-trend case, $y = X_{\\text{true}} \\beta + \\gamma \\tilde{t} + \\varepsilon$, where $\\tilde{t}$ is the standardized time index vector with zero mean and unit variance. The noise $\\varepsilon$ is independent Gaussian with standard deviation $\\sigma$. Use an intercept in all regression fits.\n\nProvide the following four datasets with fixed parameters and random seeds for reproducibility:\n- Case $1$ (happy path with direct leakage):\n  - $n = 120$, $q = 2$, $r = 3$, $\\beta = [3.0, -2.0]$, $\\sigma = 1.5$.\n  - Random seed $42$.\n  - Leakage type: direct label copy; construct $x_{\\text{leak}} = y + \\eta$ with $\\eta \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_{\\text{leak}}^2)$ and $\\sigma_{\\text{leak}} = 0.02$.\n- Case $2$ (no leakage, independent candidate):\n  - $n = 100$, $q = 3$, $r = 2$, $\\beta = [1.2, -0.8, 1.5]$, $\\sigma = 2.0$.\n  - Random seed $7$.\n  - Leakage type: random; construct $x_{\\text{leak}} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ independent of everything else.\n- Case $3$ (small sample, many noise features):\n  - $n = 25$, $q = 2$, $r = 6$, $\\beta = [1.0, 0.5]$, $\\sigma = 1.0$.\n  - Random seed $123$.\n  - Leakage type: random; construct $x_{\\text{leak}} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ independent of everything else.\n- Case $4$ (time-proxy leakage via trend):\n  - $n = 150$, $q = 1$, $r = 2$, $\\beta = [1.0]$, $\\sigma = 0.5$.\n  - Random seed $99$.\n  - Let $\\tilde{t}$ be the standardized time index vector. Response $y = X_{\\text{true}} \\beta + \\gamma \\tilde{t} + \\varepsilon$ with $\\gamma = 2.0$.\n  - Leakage type: time proxy; set $x_{\\text{leak}} = \\tilde{t}$.\n\nFor all cases, the entries of $X_{\\text{true}}$ and $X_{\\text{noise}}$ are independent and identically distributed as standard normal random variables, and the designated leakage variable is placed as the last column of $X$ so that its index is $p-1$ where $p = q + r + 1$.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets with no spaces. Each dataset contributes one triplet of the form $[\\text{list\\_before},\\text{list\\_after},\\text{flagged}]$, where the lists contain integers and the flagged value is a boolean. The overall output is therefore a list of these four triplets, for the four datasets, for example, $[[\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot],[\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot],[\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot],[\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot]]$.\n\nNo physical units, angles, or percentages are involved in this problem. All numeric thresholds and parameters must be used exactly as specified. The program must be self-contained, use the specified random seeds, and require no input.", "solution": "The problem posed is valid. It is a well-defined, self-contained, and scientifically grounded exercise in statistical learning, requiring the implementation and comparison of feature selection procedures under different data conditions. All necessary parameters, algorithms, and conditions are explicitly provided, allowing for a unique and verifiable solution.\n\nThe task is to construct a program that demonstrates the fallibility of a naive backward stepwise feature selection algorithm in the presence of data leakage, and how a pre-processing step designed to detect such leakage can rectify this issue. This will be achieved by implementing the necessary statistical components and applying them to four distinct, synthetically generated datasets.\n\nThe solution will be structured as follows: First, we define the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) used for model selection. Second, we formalize the backward stepwise selection algorithm. Third, we specify the heuristics for detecting data leakage. Finally, we outline the procedure for generating the datasets and running the comparative analysis.\n\n**1. Linear Regression and Model Selection**\n\nWe assume the standard linear model where a response vector $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is generated from a design matrix of predictors $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}$ and a random error term $\\varepsilon \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. The model, including an intercept term, is given by:\n$$ y = \\beta_0 \\mathbf{1} + X \\beta + \\varepsilon $$\nwhere $\\beta_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is the intercept, $\\mathbf{1}$ is an $n$-dimensional vector of ones, $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}^p$ is the vector of feature coefficients, and the errors are assumed to be independent and identically distributed, $\\varepsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2 I_n)$.\n\nThe Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method finds the estimates $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ and $\\hat{\\beta}$ that minimize the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS):\n$$ \\mathrm{RSS} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 = \\lVert y - \\hat{y} \\rVert_2^2 $$\nwhere $\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta}_0 \\mathbf{1} + X \\hat{\\beta}$ are the fitted values.\n\nFor model selection among a set of candidate models with varying subsets of predictors, we employ the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The BIC for a model with $k$ estimated parameters (including the intercept) based on $n$ observations is defined as:\n$$ \\mathrm{BIC} = n \\log\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{RSS}}{n}\\right) + k \\log(n) $$\nThe term $n \\log(\\mathrm{RSS}/n)$ is related to the model's goodness-of-fit (maximized log-likelihood), while $k \\log(n)$ is a penalty term for model complexity. A lower BIC value indicates a more parsimonious model that better balances fit and complexity.\n\n**2. Backward Stepwise Selection Algorithm**\n\nBackward stepwise selection is a greedy heuristic algorithm for feature selection. It starts with a model containing all candidate predictors and iteratively removes the least useful predictor until no further removal improves the model quality. The algorithm, driven by BIC, is as follows:\n\nLet $\\mathcal{F}$ be the set of all $p$ candidate feature indices, $\\mathcal{F} = \\{0, 1, \\dots, p-1\\}$.\n1.  **Initialization**: Start with the full model, where the set of active features is $\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{current}} = \\mathcal{F}$. Calculate the BIC for this model, $\\mathrm{BIC}_{\\text{current}}$.\n2.  **Iteration**:\n    a. For each feature $j \\in \\mathcal{S}_{\\text{current}}$, consider a trial model with the feature set $\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{trial}, j} = \\mathcal{S}_{\\text{current}} \\setminus \\{j\\}$. Calculate its corresponding BIC, $\\mathrm{BIC}_{\\text{trial}, j}$.\n    b. Find the feature $j^*$ whose removal results in the largest decrease (i.e., minimum value) in BIC: $j^* = \\arg\\min_{j \\in \\mathcal{S}_{\\text{current}}} \\mathrm{BIC}_{\\text{trial}, j}$. Let the best resulting BIC be $\\mathrm{BIC}_{\\text{best}} = \\mathrm{BIC}_{\\text{trial}, j^*}$.\n    c. **Decision**: If $\\mathrm{BIC}_{\\text{best}}  \\mathrm{BIC}_{\\text{current}}$, the removal is beneficial. Update the active set $\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{current}} \\leftarrow \\mathcal{S}_{\\text{current}} \\setminus \\{j^*\\}$ and update $\\mathrm{BIC}_{\\text{current}} \\leftarrow \\mathrm{BIC}_{\\text{best}}$. Repeat the iteration.\n    d. If $\\mathrm{BIC}_{\\text{best}} \\ge \\mathrm{BIC}_{\\text{current}}$, no single feature removal improves the model. The algorithm terminates.\n3.  **Output**: The final set of selected features is $\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{current}}$. If this set is empty, the final model is the intercept-only model.\n\n**3. Data Leakage Detection**\n\nData leakage occurs when information from outside the modeling process is improperly included in the feature set, often leading to unrealistically high predictive performance. We implement a pre-processing routine to flag and remove suspicious features based on two simple, powerful heuristics. Let $x_j$ be the vector for the $j$-th feature, $y$ be the response vector, and $t = [0, 1, \\dots, n-1]^\\top$ be the observation time index vector. The correlation is the Pearson correlation coefficient.\n\n-   **Rule A (Direct Label-Copy Detection)**: A feature that is a near-perfect copy of the target variable is a classic form of leakage. It is flagged if its absolute correlation with the response is above a high threshold $\\tau_{\\text{direct}}$.\n    $$ |\\text{corr}(x_j, y)|  \\tau_{\\text{direct}} = 0.995 $$\n-   **Rule B (Time-Proxy Detection)**: In time-series or ordered data, a feature might not directly copy the label but could be a proxy for time, which itself might have a strong trend that also drives the response. Such a feature is flagged if it is highly correlated with both the time index and the response.\n    $$ |\\text{corr}(x_j, t)|  \\tau_{\\text{time}} = 0.98 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad |\\text{corr}(x_j, y)|  \\tau_{\\text{time},y} = 0.7 $$\n\n**4. Experimental Procedure**\n\nFor each of the four specified datasets, we perform the following steps:\n1.  **Data Generation**: Synthesize the dataset $(X, y)$ according to its specification, including the number of true predictors ($q$), noise predictors ($r$), regression coefficients ($\\beta$), and the type of leakage for the designated leakage feature $x_{p-1}$. The random number generator is seeded for reproducibility.\n2.  **Naive Selection**: Apply the backward stepwise selection algorithm to the full feature matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}$ and the response vector $y$. The resulting set of selected feature indices is recorded.\n3.  **Leakage-Aware Selection**:\n    a. Apply the leakage detection routine to $(X, y)$ to identify a set of flagged feature indices, $\\mathcal{F}_{\\text{flagged}}$. We record whether the designated leakage feature (index $p-1$) is in this set.\n    b. Create a cleaned feature matrix $X_{\\text{clean}}$ by removing the columns corresponding to $\\mathcal{F}_{\\text{flagged}}$ from $X$.\n    c. Apply backward stepwise selection to $(X_{\\text{clean}}, y)$.\n    d. The indices selected from $X_{\\text{clean}}$ are mapped back to their original indices in $X$. This final set is recorded.\n4.  **Output**: For each dataset, a triplet is assembled, containing the sorted list of indices from naive selection, the sorted list of indices from leakage-aware selection, and a boolean indicating if the designated leakage feature was flagged.\n\nThis comparative analysis is designed to highlight scenarios where the naive approach erroneously retains a leakage variable due to its strong (but spurious) predictive power, while the leakage-aware pre-processing step correctly identifies and removes it, leading to a more robust and generalizable model.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run the entire simulation as specified.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def calculate_bic(X_subset, y):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for a linear model.\n        \n        Args:\n            X_subset: Design matrix for the model.

This principle enhances model interpretability. This advanced practice [@problem_id:3101387] challenges you to modify the standard backward selection algorithm, embedding the hierarchical constraint directly into the removal logic, thereby ensuring the final model is statistically sound and interpretable.", "problem": "You are tasked with implementing a statistically principled backward stepwise selection procedure for a linear regression model with interaction terms while enforcing the strong hierarchical principle. The model includes an intercept, three main effects, and two interactions. The procedure must use a valid statistical test derived from ordinary least squares (OLS) assumptions to decide which term to remove at each step.\n\nBase assumptions and definitions:\n- The data follow the linear model $y = X \\beta + \\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2 I_n)$, $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}$ is the design matrix, $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}^p$ is the coefficient vector, and $I_n$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix.\n- The ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator is the minimizer of the residual sum of squares and, under the Gaussian error model, yields test statistics with known distributions.\n- The strong hierarchical principle: if an interaction term is included, then its corresponding main effects must also be included. Equivalently, a main effect cannot be removed if any included interaction involves it, and an interaction can be considered for removal only when both of its main effects are currently included in the model.\n\nModel structure:\n- Predictors are $X_1, X_2, X_3$ and interactions are $X_1 X_2$ and $X_2 X_3$.\n- The design matrix columns are ordered as follows: index $0$ is the intercept, index $1$ is $X_1$, index $2$ is $X_2$, index $3$ is $X_3$, index $4$ is $X_1 X_2$, and index $5$ is $X_2 X_3$.\n- The intercept (index $0$) must always remain in the model and is never a candidate for removal.\n\nBackward stepwise rule to implement:\n- Start from the full model containing the intercept, all three main effects, and both interactions.\n- At each iteration, form the set of candidates that are eligible for removal under strong hierarchy:\n  - An interaction term (indices $4$ or $5$) is eligible only if its two corresponding main effects are included.\n  - A main effect (indices $1$, $2$, $3$) is eligible only if no interaction currently included involves it.\n- For every eligible single-term removal, compare the current model (full) to the reduced model that removes just that single term, via a valid nested-model F-test derived from first principles (using residual sums of squares).\n- Compute a two-sided decision via the F-statistic and its $p$-value. At each iteration remove the single eligible term with the largest $p$-value provided that this $p$-value is strictly greater than the threshold $\\alpha = 0.01$. If no eligible term has a $p$-value exceeding $\\alpha$, stop.\n\nTest statistic requirement:\n- Your derivation, implementation, and decision rule must start only from the linear model and Gaussian error assumptions. You must derive and use the correct nested-model F-test that compares the change in residual sum of squares to the estimated error variance, taking into account the correct degrees of freedom.\n\nSimulation and test suite:\n- For each test case, generate predictors independently as $X_1, X_2, X_3 \\overset{\\text{i.i.d.}}{\\sim} \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ and construct the interactions $X_1 X_2$ and $X_2 X_3$ deterministically from the simulated main effects.\n- Generate responses as $y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\beta_3 X_3 + \\beta_{12} (X_1 X_2) + \\beta_{23} (X_2 X_3) + \\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2)$ with $\\sigma$ specified below.\n- Use independent random seeds for each test case to ensure deterministic results.\n- Use $n = 400$ and $\\sigma = 0.5$ for all test cases.\n\nProvide and use the following test suite with seeds and true coefficients:\n- Test case T1 (happy path): seed $= 123$, $(\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\beta_2,\\beta_3,\\beta_{12},\\beta_{23}) = (0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.2, 0.0)$.\n- Test case T2 (boundary on interaction removal): seed $= 456$, $(\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\beta_2,\\beta_3,\\beta_{12},\\beta_{23}) = (0, 1.0, 0.8, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0)$.\n- Test case T3 (edge case with one interaction): seed $= 789$, $(\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\beta_2,\\beta_3,\\beta_{12},\\beta_{23}) = (0, 0.0, 0.8, 0.8, 0.0, 1.2)$.\n\nRequired program behavior:\n- Implement the backward stepwise elimination with the strong hierarchical constraints described above and the nested-model F-test at significance level $\\alpha = 0.01$.\n- For each test case, output the final set of included predictors excluding the intercept as a list of integer column indices from $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ in ascending order. For example, if the final model includes $X_1$, $X_2$, and $X_1 X_2$, print $[1,2,4]$ for that test case.\n- The final program output must aggregate the three test results into a single line that is a list of the three lists, in the same order as T1, T2, T3. For example, a valid overall output string would look like: [[1,2,4],[1,2,3],[2,3,5]].\n\nAngle units and physical units do not apply to this problem. All numeric outputs are unitless. Ensure your program produces exactly one line containing the specified aggregate list string and nothing else.", "solution": "The problem requires the implementation of a backward stepwise selection algorithm for a linear regression model, governed by the strong hierarchical principle and using a nested-model F-test for term removal.\n\n**1. Theoretical Framework: The Nested-Model F-Test**\n\nThe foundation of the selection procedure is the F-test for comparing two nested linear models. A reduced model (Model $0$) is said to be nested within a full model (Model $1$) if the predictors of Model $0$ are a subset of the predictors of Model $1$.\n\nThe general linear model is given by:\n$$y = X\\beta + \\varepsilon$$\nwhere $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is the response vector, $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}$ is the design matrix of $p$ predictors (including an intercept), $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}^p$ is the vector of coefficients, and $\\varepsilon \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is the vector of errors. We assume the errors are independent and identically distributed, following a normal distribution, $\\varepsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2 I_n)$.\n\nThe ordinary least squares (OLS) estimate of $\\beta$ is found by minimizing the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS):\n$$\\hat{\\beta} = \\arg\\min_{\\beta} ||y - X\\beta||^2 = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y$$\nThe minimized RSS for a given model with design matrix $X$ is $RSS = ||y - X\\hat{\\beta}||^2$.\n\nTo compare a reduced model (Model $0$) with $p_0$ parameters and a full model (Model $1$) with $p_1$ parameters ($p_1  p_0$), we formulate a null hypothesis $H_0$ that the additional $p_1 - p_0$ coefficients in the full model are all zero. The test statistic is:\n$$F = \\frac{(RSS_0 - RSS_1) / (p_1 - p_0)}{RSS_1 / (n - p_1)}$$\nwhere $RSS_0$ and $RSS_1$ are the residual sums of squares for the reduced and full models, respectively. The term $MSE_1 = RSS_1 / (n - p_1)$ is the mean squared error of the full model, which is an unbiased estimator of the error variance $\\sigma^2$ if the full model is correct.\n\nUnder the null hypothesis $H_0$, this $F$ statistic follows an $F$-distribution with $(p_1 - p_0)$ and $(n - p_1)$ degrees of freedom. A large value of $F$ suggests that the additional predictors in the full model significantly reduce the RSS, leading to a rejection of $H_0$. The decision is made by comparing the test's $p$-value to a pre-defined significance level $\\alpha$.\n\nIn our specific backward selection context, we test the removal of a single term at each step. Thus, $p_1 - p_0 = 1$. The \"full model\" is the current model in the selection process, and the \"reduced model\" is the model with one candidate term removed. The F-statistic for testing the removal of term $j$ is:\n$$F_j = \\frac{RSS_{\\text{reduced}, j} - RSS_{\\text{current}}}{MSE_{\\text{current}}}$$\nwhere $p_{\\text{current}}$ is the number of parameters in the current model. The corresponding $p$-value is calculated from the $F_{1, n - p_{\\text{current}}}$ distribution.\n\n**2. Algorithm: Backward Stepwise Selection with Strong Hierarchy**\n\nThe algorithm starts with the full model and iteratively removes the least significant predictor that is eligible for removal, until no more predictors can be justifiably removed.\n\n**Model Structure:**\nThe full model includes an intercept, three main effects ($X_1, X_2, X_3$), and two interaction terms ($X_1 X_2, X_2 X_3$). The columns of the design matrix are indexed as follows: $0$: intercept, $1$: $X_1$, $2$: $X_2$, $3$: $X_3$, $4$: $X_1 X_2$, $5$: $X_2 X_3$. The intercept term (index $0$) is never removed.\n\n**Strong Hierarchical Principle:**\nThis principle imposes constraints on which terms are eligible for removal:\n1.  A main effect can be removed only if no interaction term currently in the model involves it.\n    -   $X_1$ (index $1$) is eligible for removal only if $X_1 X_2$ (index $4$) is not in the model.\n    -   $X_2$ (index $2$) is eligible for removal only if both $X_1 X_2$ (index $4$) and $X_2 X_3$ (index $5$) are not in the model.\n    -   $X_3$ (index $3$) is eligible for removal only if $X_2 X_3$ (index $5$) is not in the model.\n2.  An interaction term is always eligible for removal. (The stated precondition that its main effects must be included is always satisfied in a backward selection process starting from a hierarchical model).\n\n**Step-by-Step Procedure:**\n1.  **Initialization**: Start with the full set of predictor indices, $S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\n2.  **Iteration**: Repeat the following until a stopping condition is met:\n    a.  **Identify Candidates**: Determine the subset of predictors $C \\subseteq S$ that are eligible for removal according to the strong hierarchical principle.\n    b.  **Test Candidates**: For each predictor index $j \\in C$:\n        i.   Define the current model with predictor indices $S$ (and an intercept). Let its parameter count be $p_{\\text{current}} = |S| + 1$.\n        ii.  Fit this model using OLS and compute its residual sum of squares, $RSS_{\\text{current}}$, and mean squared error, $MSE_{\\text{current}} = RSS_{\\text{current}} / (n - p_{\\text{current}})$.\n        iii. Define the reduced model with predictor indices $S \\setminus \\{j\\}$.\n        iv.  Fit the reduced model and compute its RSS, $RSS_{\\text{reduced}, j}$.\n        v.   Calculate the F-statistic: $F_j = (RSS_{\\text{reduced}, j} - RSS_{\\text{current}}) / MSE_{\\text{current}}$.\n        vi.  Calculate the corresponding $p$-value, $p_j$, from the $F_{1, n-p_{\\text{current}}}$ distribution.\n    c.  **Select for Removal**: Find the predictor $j^*$ with the maximum $p$-value: $j^* = \\arg\\max_{j \\in C} p_j$.\n    d.  **Decision**:\n        i.   If $p_{j^*}  \\alpha$ (where $\\alpha=0.01$), remove the predictor from the model: $S \\leftarrow S \\setminus \\{j^*\\}$. Continue to the next iteration.\n        ii.  If $p_{j^*} \\le \\alpha$, no predictor can be removed. The algorithm terminates.\n3.  **Final Model**: The final set of predictor indices is the set $S$ upon termination.
