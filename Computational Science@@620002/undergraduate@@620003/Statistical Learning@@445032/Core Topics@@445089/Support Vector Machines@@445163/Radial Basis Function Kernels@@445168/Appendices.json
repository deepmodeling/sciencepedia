The givens are:\n- Input data: vectors $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^p$, where $p$ is the number of features (genes).\n- Feature scales: Highly heterogeneous, with some features having magnitudes of order $10^3$ to $10^4$ and others in the range $[0, 1]$.\n- Model: SVM with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel.\n- Kernel definition: $k(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{z}) = \\exp(-\\gamma \\lVert \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{z} \\rVert^2)$, where $\\gamma > 0$ is a fixed parameter.\n- Regularization: A fixed parameter $C > 0$.\n- Critical condition: The features are not normalized or standardized before training.\n- Question: Describe the effect of this lack of scaling on the learned decision boundary.\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a common and critical issue in the practical application of machine learning algorithms, specifically distance-based methods like kernel SVMs. The setup is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities. The terminology is standard in the field of computational biology and machine learning. Thus, the problem is valid, and we may proceed to a solution.\n\nThe core of the analysis lies in the argument of the RBF kernel, which is the squared Euclidean distance between two data points, $\\lVert \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{z} \\rVert^2$. This distance is computed as a sum over all features:\n$$\n\\lVert \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{z} \\rVert^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{p} (x_i - z_i)^2\n$$\nLet us partition the set of feature indices $\\{1, 2, \\dots, p\\}$ into two disjoint sets: $I_{high}$ for high-magnitude features and $I_{low}$ for low-magnitude features.\nThe features in $I_{high}$ have values on the order of $10^3$ to $10^4$. A small relative difference in these features can lead to a very large absolute difference. For instance, if $x_j, z_j \\in I_{high}$ differ by just $1\\%$, say $x_j=5000$ and $z_j=5050$, the squared difference $(x_j - z_j)^2 = 50^2 = 2500$.\nIn contrast, for features in $I_{low}$, with values in $[0, 1]$, the maximum possible squared difference is $(1-0)^2 = 1$.\n\nThe total squared Euclidean distance can be written as:\n$$\n\\lVert \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{z} \\rVert^2 = \\sum_{j \\in I_{high}} (x_j - z_j)^2 + \\sum_{k \\in I_{low}} (x_k - z_k)^2\n$$\nIt is evident that the sum is utterly dominated by the terms from the high-magnitude features. The contribution from the low-magnitude features is numerically negligible in comparison. For any two distinct points $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{z}$ that are not extremely close in the high-scale dimensions, the term $\\sum_{j \\in I_{high}} (x_j - z_j)^2$ will be a very large positive number. Consequently, the entire squared distance $\\lVert \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{z} \\rVert^2$ will be large.\n\nNow, consider the kernel function $k(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{z}) = \\exp(-\\gamma \\lVert \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{z} \\rVert^2)$. Since $\\gamma > 0$ and $\\lVert \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{z} \\rVert^2$ is large for most pairs of points $(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{z})$, the exponent $-\\gamma \\lVert \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{z} \\rVert^2$ will be a large-magnitude negative number. This results in:\n$$\nk(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{z}) \\approx \\exp(-\\text{large positive number}) \\approx 0\n$$\nThe kernel function, which measures a notion of \"similarity,\" will evaluate to almost zero for any pair of points unless they are exceptionally close to each other, specifically in the dimensions corresponding to the high-magnitude features.\n\nThe decision function for a new point $\\mathbf{u}$ is given by $f(\\mathbf{u}) = \\sum_{i \\in \\text{SV}} \\alpha_i y_i k(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{u}) + b$, where $\\mathbf{x}_i$ are the support vectors, $y_i \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$ are their labels, and $\\alpha_i$ are the learned weights. The influence of each support vector $\\mathbf{x}_i$ on the prediction at point $\\mathbf{u}$ is mediated by the kernel value $k(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{u})$. Since this value is near zero unless $\\mathbf{u}$ is in a very small neighborhood of $\\mathbf{x}_i$, each support vector has a highly localized field of influence. This forces the decision boundary to be a complex patchwork of these small spheres of influence. The classifier will essentially try to \"memorize\" the training data by creating a very contorted boundary that is sensitive to minute changes in the high-scale features, while ignoring any information contained in the low-scale features.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n\n**A. The decision boundary is unchanged because the kernel trick makes the classifier invariant to feature scaling.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The RBF kernel's reliance on Euclidean distance makes it highly sensitive to the scale of the input features. Invariance to scaling is not a general property of the kernel trick. Some kernels, like the linear kernel, might be invariant to uniform scaling, but the RBF kernel is a prime example of a function that requires feature normalization for meaningful results.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. The decision boundary becomes dominated by high-magnitude genes: Euclidean distances are governed by those coordinates, making $k(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{z})$ near $0$ unless samples are extremely close in those genes. The classifier becomes very local and highly contorted along high-scale directions, while effectively ignoring low-scale genes.**\nThis statement accurately summarizes our derivation. The high-magnitude features dominate the Euclidean distance. This makes the RBF kernel value approach $0$ for all but the nearest neighbors in the high-dimensional feature subspace. This localization of influence leads to a highly complex, contorted, and over-fitted decision boundary that is effectively blind to the low-magnitude features.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. The decision boundary simplifies to a single linear hyperplane because large-magnitude features cause the RBF kernel to be approximately constant across samples.**\nThis is the opposite of the correct effect. The kernel values are approximately constant, but at a value of $0$, not a non-zero constant. A non-zero constant kernel (or more accurately, a kernel matrix where all off-diagonal elements are similar and close to the diagonal elements) would only arise if $\\gamma$ were extremely small, making the SVM behave like a linear classifier. Large-magnitude features with a fixed $\\gamma > 0$ have the opposite effect: they make the kernel highly non-linear and local.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Regularization implicitly rescales features, so the decision boundary is effectively the same as if all genes had been standardized in advance.**\nThis statement demonstrates a misunderstanding of the role of the regularization parameter $C$. In SVMs, $C$ controls the penalty for misclassifying training examples. It balances margin size against training error. It does not perform any form of feature scaling, either explicit or implicit. The weights $\\alpha_i$ in the dual formulation are associated with data points (support vectors), not with features. Thus, regularization does not compensate for the lack of feature normalization.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2433217"}, {"introduction": "Once your data is properly scaled, the next challenge is to tune the model's hyperparameters to find the right balance between fitting the training data and generalizing to new, unseen data.

The definitions of the SVM objective function and the RBF kernel are mathematically correct. The observed phenomenon—a large discrepancy between training accuracy ($99\\%$) and testing accuracy ($50\\%$)—is a classic case of severe overfitting. For a balanced binary classification task, a test accuracy of $50\\%$ is equivalent to random guessing, indicating a complete failure of the model to generalize. The problem is well-posed, asking for a reasoned deduction about the cause of this overfitting based on the roles of the hyperparameters $C$ and $\\gamma$. The problem statement is self-contained, objective, and internally consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe core of the problem is the vast gap between the training accuracy ($99\\%$) and the test accuracy ($50\\%$). This is a textbook example of severe overfitting, where the model learns the training data, including noise, so perfectly that it fails to generalize to unseen data. With balanced classes, a test accuracy of $50\\%$ indicates that the model's predictive power on new data is no better than chance. We must analyze the roles of the two hyperparameters, $C$ and $\\gamma$, to determine the most probable cause.\n\nThe parameter $C$ is the regularization parameter. It controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing the classification error on the training set.\n- A large $C$ imposes a high penalty on misclassified training examples (those for which $\\xi_i > 0$). This forces the optimizer to find a decision boundary that correctly classifies as many training examples as possible, even if this requires a complex boundary and a small margin. A large $C$ therefore encourages overfitting.\n- A small $C$ imposes a smaller penalty, allowing more training examples to be misclassified in favor of a larger margin. This leads to a simpler, \"softer\" decision boundary and can cause underfitting if $C$ is too small.\n\nThe parameter $\\gamma$ in the RBF kernel, $k(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}') = \\exp(-\\gamma \\lVert \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}' \\rVert^2)$, defines the influence of a single training example.\n- A small $\\gamma$ results in a large radius of influence for each support vector, as the kernel value decreases slowly with distance. The resulting decision boundary is smooth and behaves similarly to a linear classifier. A very small $\\gamma$ can lead to underfitting.\n- A large $\\gamma$ results in a very small radius of influence. The kernel value drops to near zero even for points moderately far from a support vector. This means the decision function is influenced only by points in the immediate vicinity of a support vector. The resulting decision boundary becomes highly complex and non-linear, essentially a collection of small \"islands\" of decision regions centered on the training examples. This allows the model to \"memorize\" the training set, leading to extreme overfitting.\n\nGiven the performance metrics—near-perfect training accuracy and random-chance test accuracy—the model has not just overfit but has completely failed to learn a generalizable pattern. While a large $C$ contributes to overfitting by penalizing training errors, a very large $\\gamma$ provides the mechanism for the extreme \"memorization\" behavior observed. With a large $\\gamma$, each training point can become its own support vector, creating a localized decision region around itself. This perfectly explains how the model could achieve $99\\%$ accuracy on the training set while having no predictive power for test points that do not fall extremely close to one of the training points. Therefore, an excessively large $\\gamma$ is the most direct and compelling explanation for this specific, catastrophic failure mode.\n\nEvaluation of the options:\n\nA. The regularization parameter $C$ is too large, so the model heavily penalizes training errors, shrinks the margin, and overfits the training data.\nThis statement is factually correct. A large $C$ does cause overfitting. However, it does not as directly explain the extreme nature of the performance collapse to $50\\%$ (random chance) as well as the effect of $\\gamma$. It is a contributing cause, but likely not the primary or most impactful one for this particular result.\n\nB. The regularization parameter $C$ is too small, so the model underfits; this explains the $99\\%$ training accuracy but $50\\%$ test accuracy.\nThis statement is contradictory. A small $C$ would lead to underfitting, which would manifest as low training accuracy, not $99\\%$. Therefore, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\nC. The RBF kernel width parameter $\\gamma$ is too large, so $k(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}')$ becomes highly localized and the decision function becomes overly complex, effectively memorizing the training set.\nThis statement accurately describes the effect of a large $\\gamma$. The high localization leads to a model that can perfectly fit the training data's specific arrangement, resulting in near-perfect training accuracy. This same complexity leads to a complete failure to generalize, producing test accuracy no better than random guessing. This is the most precise explanation for the observed performance. This option is **Correct**.\n\nD. The RBF kernel width parameter $\\gamma$ is too small, so the kernel becomes too broad and nearly linear; this explains the $99\\%$ training accuracy but $50\\%$ test accuracy.\nThis statement is contradictory. A small $\\gamma$ leads to a simpler, near-linear model, which would cause underfitting if the true boundary is complex. It would be incapable of achieving $99\\%$ training accuracy on a complex dataset. Therefore, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\nComparing A and C, option C provides a more powerful and specific explanation for the extremity of the observed overfitting.

The stability is quantified by the matrix's spectral condition number. We will investigate two primary sources of ill-conditioning and two corresponding regularization strategies.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental principles. The Gaussian RBF kernel between two points $x_i, x_j \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ is given by\n$$\nK_{ij} = \\exp(-\\gamma \\lVert x_i - x_j \\rVert_2^2)\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma > 0$. The resulting $n \\times n$ matrix $K$ is symmetric and positive semidefinite. The numerical stability of solving linear systems involving $K$, such as in Support Vector Machines or Kernel Ridge Regression, is dictated by its spectral condition number, $\\kappa_2(K) = \\sigma_{\\max}(K) / \\sigma_{\\min}(K)$, where $\\sigma_{\\max}$ and $\\sigma_{\\min}$ are the largest and smallest singular values of $K$. Since $K$ is symmetric positive semidefinite, its singular values are its eigenvalues. A large condition number indicates that the matrix is close to singular and that numerical computations involving it may be unstable. The problem defines a clipped version of this measure, $\\kappa_\\delta(K) = \\sigma_{\\max}(K) / \\max\\{\\sigma_{\\min}(K), \\delta\\}$, with a floor $\\delta = 10^{-15}$ to handle values below machine precision.\n\nTwo primary failure modes for the Gaussian kernel matrix are:\n1.  **Choice of $\\gamma$**:\n    - As $\\gamma \\to 0$, the exponent $-\\gamma \\lVert x_i - x_j \\rVert_2^2 \\to 0$. Consequently, every element $K_{ij} \\to \\exp(0) = 1$. The kernel matrix $K$ approaches the matrix of all ones, $J_n$. This matrix has rank $1$, with one eigenvalue equal to $n$ and $n-1$ eigenvalues equal to $0$. Thus, for very small $\\gamma$, $K$ becomes nearly singular, leading to an extremely large condition number.\n    - As $\\gamma \\to \\infty$, for distinct points $x_i \\neq x_j$, the exponent $-\\gamma \\lVert x_i - x_j \\rVert_2^2 \\to -\\infty$, so the off-diagonal elements $K_{ij} \\to 0$. The diagonal elements remain $K_{ii} = \\exp(0)=1$. Thus, $K$ approaches the identity matrix $I_n$, which is perfectly conditioned ($\\kappa_2(I_n) = 1$). However, if points are very close, the off-diagonal entries may not decay to zero fast enough, or if machine precision limits are reached, they could become numerically zero, potentially isolating points and affecting the spectrum.\n\n2.  **Data Geometry**: If the dataset contains duplicate points, e.g., $x_i = x_k$ for $i \\neq k$, then the $i$-th and $k$-th rows (and columns) of the kernel matrix become identical. This linear dependence makes the matrix $K$ singular for any $\\gamma > 0$, meaning its smallest singular value is exactly $0$.\n\nTwo regularization strategies are proposed to mitigate these issues:\n1.  **Jitter Regularization**: A small positive term $\\epsilon$ is added to the diagonal of $K$, resulting in $K_\\epsilon = K + \\epsilon I_n$. This shifts all eigenvalues of $K$ by $\\epsilon$. If the eigenvalues of $K$ are $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_n \\ge 0$, the eigenvalues of $K_\\epsilon$ are $\\lambda_i + \\epsilon$. This guarantees that the smallest eigenvalue of $K_\\epsilon$ is at least $\\epsilon$, thus bounding the condition number.\n2.  **Bounded-$\\gamma$ Prior**: This approach restricts $\\gamma$ to a pre-defined interval $[\\gamma_{\\min}, \\gamma_{\\max}]$. By clipping candidate $\\gamma$ values, it prevents the use of extreme values that are known to cause ill-conditioning.\n\nWe now proceed to evaluate the seven test cases based on these principles.\n\n**Test Case 1: On $\\mathcal{A}$ with $\\gamma = 10^{-12}$ and no jitter, report the near-singularity boolean.**\nDataset $\\mathcal{A}$ contains duplicate points: $x_5 = x_6 = (0.1, 0.1)$. This implies that for any $\\gamma > 0$, the 5th and 6th rows of the kernel matrix $K$ will be identical. A matrix with linearly dependent rows is singular, meaning its determinant is $0$ and it has at least one zero eigenvalue. Consequently, $\\sigma_{\\min}(K)$ will be $0$ (or a value on the order of machine epsilon in finite precision arithmetic). The near-singularity threshold is $\\tau = 10^{-12}$. Since $\\sigma_{\\min}(K) \\approx 0 < 10^{-12}$, the matrix is declared nearly singular. The result is `True`.\n\n**Test Case 2: On $\\mathcal{A}$ with $\\gamma = 1$ and no jitter, report the near-singularity boolean.**\nAs in the previous case, the presence of duplicate points $x_5=x_6$ in dataset $\\mathcal{A}$ ensures that the kernel matrix $K$ is singular. This property is independent of the value of $\\gamma$ (as long as $\\gamma > 0$). Therefore, $\\sigma_{\\min}(K) \\approx 0$, which is less than the threshold $\\tau=10^{-12}$. The matrix is nearly singular. The result is `True`.\n\n**Test Case 3: On $\\mathcal{A}$ with $\\gamma = 1$ and jitter $\\epsilon = 10^{-6}$, report $\\log_{10}\\kappa_\\delta(K_\\epsilon)$.**\nFrom Test Case 2, we know that for $\\gamma=1$ on dataset $\\mathcal{A}$, the kernel matrix $K$ is singular, so $\\sigma_{\\min}(K) = 0$. Applying jitter regularization forms $K_\\epsilon = K + \\epsilon I_n$. This shifts the eigenvalues of $K$ by $\\epsilon = 10^{-6}$. The smallest singular value (eigenvalue) of $K_\\epsilon$ will be approximately $\\epsilon$. Thus, $\\sigma_{\\min}(K_\\epsilon) \\approx 10^{-6}$. The largest singular value $\\sigma_{\\max}(K_\\epsilon)$ will be $\\sigma_{\\max}(K) + \\epsilon$. The condition number is then $\\kappa_\\delta(K_\\epsilon) \\approx (\\sigma_{\\max}(K)+\\epsilon)/\\epsilon$. We compute this value numerically. The log-condition number will be approximately $\\log_{10}(\\sigma_{\\max}(K) / 10^{-6}) = \\log_{10}(\\sigma_{\\max}(K)) + 6$.\n\n**Test Case 4: On $\\mathcal{B}$ with $\\gamma = 10^{-12}$ and no jitter, report $\\log_{10}\\kappa_\\delta(K)$.**\nDataset $\\mathcal{B}$ contains distinct points, so the matrix is not guaranteed to be singular. However, $\\gamma = 10^{-12}$ is extremely small. As explained in the principles, for $\\gamma \\to 0$, the kernel matrix $K$ approaches the rank-1 matrix of all ones, $J_6$. This matrix will be nearly singular, with one large singular value close to $n=6$ and $n-1=5$ singular values very close to $0$. The smallest singular value, $\\sigma_{\\min}(K)$, is expected to be much smaller than the clipping parameter $\\delta = 10^{-15}$. Therefore, the clipped condition number will be $\\kappa_\\delta(K) = \\sigma_{\\max}(K) / \\delta$. The result will be $\\log_{10}(\\sigma_{\\max}(K)) - \\log_{10}(10^{-15}) \\approx \\log_{10}(6) + 15 \\approx 15.778$.\n\n**Test Case 5: On $\\mathcal{B}$, report the worst-case $\\log_{10}\\kappa_\\delta(K)$ after applying a bounded-$\\gamma$ prior.**\nThe candidate set for $\\gamma$ is $\\{10^{-12}, 10^{-3}, 1, 10^{3}, 10^{12}\\}$. The prior interval is $[\\gamma_{\\min}, \\gamma_{\\max}] = [10^{-3}, 10^{3}]$. Applying the clipping rule $\\gamma_{\\text{clip}} = \\min\\{\\max\\{\\gamma, \\gamma_{\\min}\\}, \\gamma_{\\max}\\}$ to the set gives:\n- $\\gamma=10^{-12} \\to 10^{-3}$\n- $\\gamma=10^{-3} \\to 10^{-3}$\n- $\\gamma=1 \\to 1$\n- $\\gamma=10^{3} \\to 10^{3}$\n- $\\gamma=10^{12} \\to 10^{3}$\nThe effective set of parameters to test is $\\{10^{-3}, 1, 10^{3}\\}$. We compute $\\log_{10}\\kappa_\\delta(K)$ for each of these three $\\gamma$ values and report the maximum. The smallest effective gamma, $\\gamma=10^{-3}$, is expected to yield the highest condition number, as it is closest to the $\\gamma \\to 0$ singular regime.\n\n**Test Case 6: On $\\mathcal{B}$, report the worst-case $\\log_{10}\\kappa_\\delta(K_\\epsilon)$ with jitter.**\nWe use the original candidate set for $\\gamma$, $\\{10^{-12}, 10^{-3}, 1, 10^{3}, 10^{12}\\}$, but apply jitter $\\epsilon = 10^{-6}$ for each case. The jitter prevents the condition number from exploding.\n- For $\\gamma=10^{-12}$, $K \\approx J_6$. The eigenvalues of $K_\\epsilon$ are approximately $\\{6+\\epsilon, \\epsilon, \\epsilon, \\epsilon, \\epsilon, \\epsilon\\}$. So $\\kappa(K_\\epsilon) \\approx (6+\\epsilon)/\\epsilon \\approx 6 \\times 10^6$.\n- For large $\\gamma=10^{12}$, $K \\approx I_6$, so $K_\\epsilon \\approx (1+\\epsilon)I_6$, and $\\kappa(K_\\epsilon) \\approx 1$.\nThe worst-case (maximum) condition number is expected for the smallest $\\gamma$, i.e., $\\gamma=10^{-12}$. We compute the five values of $\\log_{10}\\kappa_\\delta(K_\\epsilon)$ and take the maximum.\n\n**Test Case 7: On $\\mathcal{B}$ with $\\gamma = 10^6$ and no jitter, report $\\log_{10}\\kappa_\\delta(K)$.**\nHere, $\\gamma=10^6$ is very large. Since all points in dataset $\\mathcal{B}$ are distinct, the kernel matrix $K$ will approach the identity matrix $I_6$. The off-diagonal entries $K_{ij} = \\exp(-10^6 \\lVert x_i - x_j \\rVert_2^2)$ will be extremely close to zero. The matrix will be strongly diagonally dominant, with all diagonal entries being $1$. Consequently, its singular values will all be very close to $1$, and its condition number will be close to $1$. The resulting $\\log_{10}\\kappa_\\delta(K)$ will be very close to $0$.\n\nThe implementation will compute these quantities numerically.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n# from scipy is not needed, numpy is sufficient\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem by performing the 7 specified test cases on RBF kernel matrices.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Data and Parameters ---\n    \n    # Dataset A (with duplicate points)\n    X_A = np.array([\n        [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0],\n        [0.1, 0.1], [0.1, 0.1]\n    ])\n    \n    # Dataset B (all distinct points)\n    X_B = np.array([\n        [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0],\n        [0.1, 0.1], [0.9, 0.9]\n    ])\n    \n    # Regularization parameters\n    tau = 1e-12\n    delta = 1e-15\n    epsilon = 1e-6\n    gamma_min = 1e-3\n    gamma_max = 1e3\n\n    # --- Helper Functions ---\n    \n    def get_kernel_matrix(X, gamma):\n        \"\"\"Computes the Gaussian RBF kernel matrix.\"\"\"\n        # Pairwise squared Euclidean distances\n        # Using broadcasting for efficiency: (n, 1, d) - (1, n, d) -> (n, n, d)\n        diffs = X[:, np.newaxis, :] - X[np.newaxis, :, :]\n        sq_dists = np.sum(diffs**2, axis=-1)\n        \n        # Gaussian kernel\n        K = np.exp(-gamma * sq_dists)\n        return K\n\n    def get_log_cond(K, d):\n        \"\"\"Computes the clipped log10 condition number.\"\"\"\n        # Singular values\n        s = np.linalg.svd(K, compute_uv=False)\n        sigma_max = np.max(s)\n        sigma_min = np.min(s)\n        \n        # Clipped condition number\n        kappa_delta = sigma_max / np.maximum(sigma_min, d)\n        \n        return np.log10(kappa_delta)\n        \n    def is_nearly_singular(K, t):\n        \"\"\"Checks if a matrix is nearly singular based on its smallest singular value.\"\"\"\n        s = np.linalg.svd(K, compute_uv=False)\n        sigma_min = np.min(s)\n        return sigma_min < t\n\n    results = []\n\n    # --- Test Suite Execution ---\n\n    # Test 1\n    gamma1 = 1e-12\n    K1 = get_kernel_matrix(X_A, gamma1)\n    results.append(is_nearly_singular(K1, tau))\n\n    # Test 2\n    gamma2 = 1.0\n    K2 = get_kernel_matrix(X_A, gamma2)\n    results.append(is_nearly_singular(K2, tau))\n\n    # Test 3\n    gamma3 = 1.0\n    K3 = get_kernel_matrix(X_A, gamma3)\n    K3_eps = K3 + epsilon * np.eye(K3.shape[0])\n    results.append(get_log_cond(K3_eps, delta))\n\n    # Test 4\n    gamma4 = 1e-12\n    K4 = get_kernel_matrix(X_B, gamma4)\n    results.append(get_log_cond(K4, delta))\n    \n    # Test 5\n    gamma_set = [1e-12, 1e-3, 1.0, 1e3, 1e12]\n    clipped_gammas = [np.clip(g, gamma_min, gamma_max) for g in gamma_set]\n    log_conds5 = []\n    for g in np.unique(clipped_gammas): # Use unique to avoid redundant calculations\n         K5 = get_kernel_matrix(X_B, g)\n         log_conds5.append(get_log_cond(K5, delta))\n    results.append(np.max(log_conds5))\n\n    # Test 6\n    log_conds6 = []\n    for g in gamma_set:\n        K6 = get_kernel_matrix(X_B, g)\n        K6_eps = K6 + epsilon * np.eye(K6.shape[0])\n        log_conds6.append(get_log_cond(K6_eps, delta))\n    results.append(np.max(log_conds6))\n\n    # Test 7\n    gamma7 = 1e6\n    K7 = get_kernel_matrix(X_B, gamma7)\n    results.append(get_log_cond(K7, delta))\n    \n    # --- Final Output ---\n    # Format: [result1,result2,result3,result4,result5,result6,result7]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3165648"}]}
