A detailed solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nA linear SVM seeks a separating hyperplane of the form $\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{z} + b = 0$, where $\\mathbf{z} = (x, y)^T$ and $\\mathbf{w} = (w_1, w_2)^T$. The hard-margin SVM aims to maximize the margin width, $2/\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|$, subject to the constraints $t_i(\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{z}_i + b) \\ge 1$ for all data points $(\\mathbf{z}_i, t_i)$.\n\nGiven the horizontal separation of the data strips, the maximal-margin hyperplane must be horizontal. Any non-zero $w_1$ component would cause the term $w_1 x_i$ to vary over the range $[-L|w_1|, L|w_1|]$. To satisfy the constraints $t_i(w_1 x_i + w_2 y_i + b) \\ge 1$ for all possible values of $x_i \\in [-L, L]$, $\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|$ would need to be larger than if $w_1=0$. Therefore, to minimize $\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|$, the optimal solution must have $w_1=0$. The separating hyperplane is of the form $w_2 y + b = 0$, which is a horizontal line.\n\nFor such a hyperplane, the constraints are:\n1. For positive points ($t_i=+1$): $w_2 y_i + b \\ge 1$ for all $y_i \\in [\\delta - \\epsilon, \\delta + \\epsilon]$.\n2. For negative points ($t_i=-1$): $-(w_2 y_j + b) \\ge 1 \\implies w_2 y_j + b \\le -1$ for all $y_j \\in [-\\delta - \\epsilon, -\\delta + \\epsilon]$.\n\nTo satisfy these for all points, they must hold for the \"worst-case\" $y$-coordinates, which are those closest to the other class.\n1. $w_2 (\\min y_i) + b \\ge 1 \\implies w_2(\\delta - \\epsilon) + b \\ge 1$.\n2. $w_2 (\\max y_j) + b \\le -1 \\implies w_2(-\\delta + \\epsilon) + b \\le -1$.\n\nTo maximize the margin $2/|w_2|$, we must minimize $|w_2|$. Assuming $w_2 > 0$ (so positive points are on the \"positive\" side), this occurs when the inequalities become equalities:\n$w_2(\\delta - \\epsilon) + b = 1$\n$w_2(-\\delta + \\epsilon) + b = -1$\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first yields $w_2((\\delta - \\epsilon) - (-\\delta + \\epsilon)) = 2$, which simplifies to $w_2(2\\delta - 2\\epsilon) = 2$, so $w_2 = \\frac{1}{\\delta - \\epsilon}$.\nAdding the two equations yields $2b = 0$, so $b=0$.\n\nThe maximal-margin separating hyperplane is $y/(\\delta-\\epsilon) = 0$, which is $y=0$. The margin hyperplanes are $y/(\\delta-\\epsilon) = \\pm 1$, i.e., $y = \\pm(\\delta - \\epsilon)$.\n\n**A. In the hard-margin case with $|\\eta_i|, |\\tilde\\eta_i| \\le \\epsilon < \\delta$, the maximal-margin separating hyperplane is the horizontal line $y=0$, and the margin width measured orthogonally to the strip equals $2(\\delta - \\epsilon)$.**\n\nAs derived above, the maximal-margin separating hyperplane is indeed $y=0$. The margin width is given by $2/\\|\\mathbf{w}\\| = 2/\\sqrt{w_1^2 + w_2^2} = 2/|w_2| = 2(\\delta - \\epsilon)$. The strip is horizontal, and the measurement is orthogonal to it (i.e., in the $y$-direction), which is consistent with the calculation. This statement is a direct consequence of the SVM optimization on this dataset.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. If $\\epsilon = 0$, then every training point is a support vector; moreover, any arbitrarily small changes to the $x$-coordinates alone (keeping all $y$-coordinates at $\\pm \\delta$) do not change the support vector set.**\n\nIf $\\epsilon = 0$, all positive-class points are on the line $y=\\delta$, and all negative-class points are on the line $y=-\\delta$.\nFollowing the same derivation with $\\epsilon=0$, we find $w_2 = 1/\\delta$ and $b=0$.\nThe margin hyperplanes are $y = \\pm \\delta$.\nA point $\\mathbf{z}_i$ with label $t_i$ is a support vector if $t_i(\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{z}_i + b) = 1$.\n- For any positive point $\\mathbf{z}_i = (x_i, \\delta)$ with $t_i=+1$: $t_i(\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{z}_i + b) = 1 \\cdot ((0, 1/\\delta)^T(x_i, \\delta) + 0) = (1/\\delta)\\delta = 1$. So, all positive points are support vectors.\n- For any negative point $\\mathbf{z}_j = (x_j, -\\delta)$ with $t_j=-1$: $t_j(\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{z}_j + b) = -1 \\cdot ((0, 1/\\delta)^T(x_j, -\\delta) + 0) = -1 \\cdot ((1/\\delta)(-\\delta)) = 1$. So, all negative points are support vectors.\nThus, every training point is a support vector.\n\nThe support vector condition $t_i(y_i/\\delta) = 1$ depends only on the $y$-coordinate. Changing the $x$-coordinate of any point does not affect this condition. Since all points are initially support vectors, they all remain support vectors after their $x$-coordinates are changed.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. For $\\epsilon > 0$, the support vectors are exactly those points that attain the smallest absolute $y$ within each class (i.e., those with $y$-coordinates closest to $0$); changing $x$-coordinates alone cannot change which points are support vectors, but arbitrarily small changes in the $y$-coordinates within the strip can swap which points are support vectors.**\n\nAs established, the margin hyperplanes are $y = \\pm(\\delta-\\epsilon)$. Support vectors are the points that lie on these hyperplanes.\n- A positive-class point $(x_i, y_i)$ is a support vector if $y_i = \\delta-\\epsilon$. This corresponds to the minimum possible $y$-value (and thus minimum absolute $y$-value, since $y>0$) for a positive-class point.\n- A negative-class point $(x_j, y_j)$ is a support vector if $y_j = -(\\delta-\\epsilon) = -\\delta+\\epsilon$. This corresponds to the maximum possible $y$-value for a negative-class point, which is the minimum absolute $y$-value ($|y_j| = \\delta-\\epsilon$).\nSo the first part of the statement is correct.\n\nSince the condition for being a support vector depends only on the $y$-coordinate, changing $x$-coordinates alone has no effect on which points are support vectors. The second part is also correct.\n\nFinally, consider two positive-class points $P_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $P_2 = (x_2, y_2)$ where $y_1 = \\delta-\\epsilon$ (making $P_1$ a support vector) and $y_2 = \\delta-\\epsilon+\\Delta$ for some small $\\Delta > 0$ (making $P_2$ not a support vector). We can apply an arbitrarily small perturbation to their $y$-coordinates: change $y_1$ to $y_1' = y_1 + \\Delta/2$ and $y_2$ to $y_2' = y_2 - \\Delta = \\delta-\\epsilon$. Now, $P_2$ has become a support vector, while $P_1$ is no longer one. This demonstrates that arbitrarily small changes in $y$-coordinates can change the support vector set. The third part is correct.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. In the soft-margin case with very large $C$, a single positive-class point moved slightly below the line $y=0$ cannot become a support vector as long as the downward perturbation is sufficiently small.**\n\nA very large penalty parameter $C$ makes the soft-margin SVM behave like a hard-margin SVM if the data is linearly separable. Let's move a positive-class point $(x_k, y_k)$ to a new position $(x_k, y_k')$ where $y_k'=-\\mu$ for some small $\\mu > 0$. The data may or may not remain linearly separable, depending on the $y$-coordinates of the negative points.\nCase 1: The new dataset is linearly separable (e.g., if $-\\mu > \\max_j y_j^-$). With large $C$, the SVM finds the new hard-margin solution. The point $(x_k, -\\mu)$ is now the positive-class point with the smallest $y$-value. The separating boundary will be determined by this point and the highest negative-class point. Therefore, $(x_k, -\\mu)$ will lie on the new margin and be a support vector.\nCase 2: The new dataset is not linearly separable. The SVM must tolerate some error. Points for which the constraint $t_i(\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{z}_i+b) \\ge 1$ is violated will have a slack penalty $\\xi_i > 0$. In the dual formulation, this corresponds to the Lagrange multiplier for that point being at its upper bound, $\\alpha_i = C$. Since $C>0$, we have $\\alpha_i > 0$, which by definition means the point is a support vector. The point $(x_k, -\\mu)$ is a positive point in the negative region, so it will almost certainly be misclassified by any reasonable hyperplane, leading to $\\xi_k > 0$ and thus making it a support vector.\nIn all plausible scenarios, the moved point becomes a support vector. The statement that it *cannot* become a support vector is false.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. In the soft-margin case with very small $C$, the optimal separating hyperplane must be parallel to the strip (i.e., vertical) to minimize the hinge loss.**\n\nIn the soft-margin SVM, the objective is to minimize $\\frac{1}{2}\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|^2 + C\\sum_i \\xi_i$. As $C \\to 0$, the first term, $\\frac{1}{2}\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|^2$, dominates the objective function. To minimize this term, the SVM will choose $\\mathbf{w}$ to be as close to the zero vector as possible. The optimal solution converges to $\\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{0}$. A vertical hyperplane, $x=k$, corresponds to $\\mathbf{w} = (w_1, 0)$ with $w_1 \\ne 0$, so $\\|\\mathbf{w}\\| > 0$. This solution is clearly suboptimal compared to $\\mathbf{w}=\\mathbf{0}$ for sufficiently small $C$.\nFurthermore, the claim is that a vertical hyperplane is chosen \"to minimize the hinge loss.\" A vertical hyperplane would be a very poor separator for these horizontally-arranged data strips and would result in a large hinge loss, as roughly half the points in each class would be on the wrong side. A horizontal hyperplane would yield a much smaller (or zero) hinge loss. The statement is flawed in multiple ways.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "3147125"}, {"introduction": "While the concept of maximizing geometric margin is elegant, its practical application depends critically on how we measure distance.

This implies the offset $b=0$. The problem simplifies to:\n$$\n\\min_{w} \\frac{1}{2} \\|w\\|^2 \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad y_i (w^T x_i) \\geq 1.\n$$\n\n#### Analysis in the Observed Space ($x$)\n\nThe data points in the observed space are $x^{(+)}_1 = (M,1)$, $x^{(+)}_2 = (1.5M,1.5)$, $x^{(-)}_1 = (-M,-1)$, and $x^{(-)}_2 = (-1.5M,-1.5)$.\nAll these points are collinear and lie on the line passing through the origin with direction vector $v = (M,1)$. Each point $x_i$ can be written as $x_i = c_i v$ for some scalar $c_i$. The scalars are $c_1=1$, $c_2=1.5$ for class $+1$ and $c_3=-1$, $c_4=-1.5$ for class $-1$. The corresponding labels are $y_1=1, y_2=1, y_3=-1, y_4=-1$.\n\nLet the normal vector in this space be $w_x$. The constraints are:\n$y_i (w_x^T (c_i v)) \\geq 1 \\implies (y_i c_i) (w_x^T v) \\geq 1$.\n\nLet's compute the products $y_i c_i$:\n-   $y_1 c_1 = (+1)(1) = 1$\n-   $y_2 c_2 = (+1)(1.5) = 1.5$\n-   $y_3 c_3 = (-1)(-1) = 1$\n-   $y_4 c_4 = (-1)(-1.5) = 1.5$\n\nAll values of $y_i c_i$ are positive. Let $K_x = w_x^T v$. The constraints for all four points become $1 \\cdot K_x \\geq 1$ and $1.5 \\cdot K_x \\geq 1$. For both to hold, we only need to satisfy the stricter one derived from the points with minimum $y_i c_i$, which is $K_x \\geq 1$.\n\nThe optimization problem is to minimize $\\frac{1}{2} \\|w_x\\|^2$ subject to the single constraint $w_x^T v \\geq 1$, which is $M w_{x1} + w_{x2} \\geq 1$. The minimum of $\\|w_x\\|^2$ will occur when the constraint is active, i.e., at equality: $M w_{x1} + w_{x2} = 1$.\n\nWe use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let $L(w_x, \\lambda) = \\frac{1}{2}(w_{x1}^2 + w_{x2}^2) - \\lambda(M w_{x1} + w_{x2} - 1)$.\nTaking partial derivatives with respect to $w_{x1}$ and $w_{x2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_{x1}} = w_{x1} - \\lambda M = 0 \\implies w_{x1} = \\lambda M\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_{x2}} = w_{x2} - \\lambda = 0 \\implies w_{x2} = \\lambda\n$$\nSubstituting these into the constraint equation:\n$$\nM(\\lambda M) + \\lambda = 1 \\implies \\lambda(M^2+1) = 1 \\implies \\lambda = \\frac{1}{M^2+1}\n$$\nThe optimal normal vector is therefore:\n$$\nw_x = \\left(\\frac{M}{M^2+1}, \\frac{1}{M^2+1}\\right)\n$$\nThis vector is proportional to $(M,1)$. For $M \\gg 1$, the direction of $w_x$ approaches $(1,0)$, which is a horizontal vector. The separating hyperplane is defined by $w_x^T x = 0$, which is $M x_1 + x_2 = 0$. This is the line $x_2 = -M x_1$. For large $M$, this is a very steep line, i.e., a nearly vertical separating line, which is almost parallel to the $x_2$-axis.\n\n#### Analysis in the Whitened Space ($z$)\n\nThe whitening transformation $z=Wx$ maps the observed points $x_i$ back to the intrinsic points $z_i$. The analysis is performed on the points $z^{(+)}_1 = (1,1)$, $z^{(+)}_2 = (1.5,1.5)$, $z^{(-)}_1 = (-1,-1)$, and $z^{(-)}_2 = (-1.5,-1.5)$.\nThese points lie on the line through the origin with direction vector $u = (1,1)$.\nThe same logic applies. Let the normal vector in this space be $w_z$. The optimization problem is to minimize $\\frac{1}{2} \\|w_z\\|^2$ subject to $y_i(w_z^T z_i) \\geq 1$. This simplifies to minimizing $\\frac{1}{2} \\|w_z\\|^2$ subject to $w_z^T u \\geq 1$.\n\nThe minimum occurs when $w_z^T u = 1$, which is $w_{z1} + w_{z2} = 1$.\nUsing Lagrange multipliers for $L(w_z, \\lambda) = \\frac{1}{2}(w_{z1}^2 + w_{z2}^2) - \\lambda(w_{z1} + w_{z2} - 1)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_{z1}} = w_{z1} - \\lambda = 0 \\implies w_{z1} = \\lambda\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_{z2}} = w_{z2} - \\lambda = 0 \\implies w_{z2} = \\lambda\n$$\nSubstituting into the constraint:\n$$\n\\lambda + \\lambda = 1 \\implies 2\\lambda=1 \\implies \\lambda = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe optimal normal vector is:\n$$\nw_z = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThis vector is proportional to $(1,1)$. The separating hyperplane is $w_z^T z = 0$, which is $z_1 + z_2 = 0$. This is the line $z_2 = -z_1$, a diagonal line with slope $-1$. It is orthogonal to the line $z_2 = z_1$ on which the data lies. This is a balanced separator.\n\n### Step 3: Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In observed coordinates with $M \\gg 1$, the maximal margin normal vector is proportional to $(M,\\,1)$, producing a nearly vertical separating line (hyperplane almost parallel to the $x_2$-axis). After whitening by $W = S^{-1}$, the maximal margin normal vector is proportional to $(1,\\,1)$, yielding the balanced diagonal separator orthogonal to $x_1 + x_2 = 0$.**\n-   The analysis of the observed coordinates is correct. The normal vector is proportional to $(M,1)$, and for large $M$, the separating line $x_2 = -M x_1$ is nearly vertical.\n-   The analysis of the whitened coordinates is also correct. The normal vector is proportional to $(1,1)$, and the separator is the balanced diagonal line $z_1+z_2=0$.\n-   The final phrase, \"orthogonal to $x_1 + x_2 = 0$\", is awkwardly phrased. In the whitened space, the separator is $z_1+z_2=0$, which is orthogonal to the line $z_1-z_2=0$ (where the data lies). The phrase might be a typo for \"orthogonal to the line $z_1-z_2=0$\" or simply a poor description. However, the core physical and mathematical claims about the normal vectors are accurate. Given that this is a multiple-choice question, this option is the most accurate description of the results.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Whitening leaves the maximal margin normal vector unchanged, because Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are invariant to feature scaling.**\nThis statement is incorrect on two counts. First, our derivation shows that the normal vector changes direction from being proportional to $(M,1)$ to being proportional to $(1,1)$. Second, the reason given is false. Standard SVMs are known *not* to be invariant to feature scaling, which is the very phenomenon this problem demonstrates.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Even without whitening, switching to a soft-margin SVM with any finite penalty parameter $C$ will rotate the separator in observed coordinates to be proportional to $(1,\\,1)$.**\nIn the soft-margin SVM, the normal vector is given by $w_x = \\sum_i \\alpha_i y_i x_i$. Since every data point $x_i$ is a scalar multiple of the vector $v=(M,1)$, i.e., $x_i = c_i v$, the resulting normal vector is $w_x = \\sum_i \\alpha_i y_i c_i v = (\\sum_i \\alpha_i y_i c_i) v$. This shows that $w_x$ must be proportional to $v=(M,1)$ for any set of non-zero Lagrange multipliers $\\alpha_i$. Therefore, the orientation of the separator does not change, and it will not become proportional to $(1,1)$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. In observed coordinates the maximal margin normal vector is proportional to $(1,\\,1)$ for all $M$, but whitening rotates it toward $(M,\\,1)$ when $M \\gg 1$.**\nThis statement is the exact opposite of our findings. In observed coordinates, the normal vector is proportional to $(M,1)$, not $(1,1)$. After whitening, it is proportional to $(1,1)$, not $(M,1)$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3147185"}, {"introduction": "The soft-margin classifier's ability to handle non-separable data hinges on how it penalizes errors.

It presents a valid, solvable problem.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Analysis\nSince the margins of both hyperplanes are identical ($\\gamma=1$), the preference between them is determined solely by the aggregate violation term.

Hyperplane $H_1$ accommodates the outlier $x_3$ badly, incurring a single large slack variable $\\xi_3=5$, which results in a very large squared penalty of $25$. Hyperplane $H_2$ shifts to better accommodate the outlier (reducing its slack to $\\xi_3=3$), but at the cost of introducing several smaller violations for other points. The sum of squared slacks for $H_2$ ($12.5$) is much lower than for $H_1$, because squaring punishes the single large value $5$ more than the collection of smaller values $\\{3, 0.5, 1, 1.5\\}$.\n\nConversely, the linear ($L_1$) penalty simply sums the violations. For $H_1$, the total violation is $5$. For $H_2$, the total violation is $6$. Therefore, the linear penalty prefers $H_1$, which correctly classifies more points, even though it makes one very large error. This demonstrates that an $L_1$ penalty is more robust to outliers, as it tolerates large errors on a few points in exchange for better overall performance on the majority, leading to a \"sparser\" set of violations.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Under quadratic penalization, $H_1$ is preferred because one large violation is cheaper than several small ones once squared; under linear penalization, $H_2$ would be preferred.**\n- The statement that $H_1$ is preferred under quadratic penalization is **Incorrect**. Our calculation shows $H_2$ is preferred ($12.5 < 25$).\n- The reasoning \"one large violation is cheaper than several small ones once squared\" is fundamentally **Incorrect**. Squaring makes large values disproportionately more costly.\n- The statement that $H_2$ would be preferred under linear penalization is **Incorrect**. Our calculation shows $H_1$ is preferred ($5 < 6$).\n\n**B. Under quadratic penalization, $H_2$ is preferred because distributing violation across several smaller slacks reduces $\\sum \\xi_i^2$ even if the linear sum $\\sum \\xi_i$ increases; under linear penalization, $H_1$ would be preferred.**\n- The statement \"Under quadratic penalization, $H_2$ is preferred\" is **Correct** ($12.5 < 25$).\n- The reasoning \"distributing violation across several smaller slacks reduces $\\sum \\xi_i^2$\" is **Correct**. This is the key property of $L_2$ penalties. Our calculation confirms this: $\\sum \\xi_{i,2}^2 = 12.5$ is less than $\\xi_{3,1}^2=25$. The condition \"even if the linear sum $\\sum \\xi_i$ increases\" is also met ($6 > 5$).\n- The statement \"under linear penalization, $H_1$ would be preferred\" is **Correct** ($5 < 6$).\n- This option correctly identifies the preferred hyperplane under both penalty schemes and provides the correct conceptual reasoning.\n\n**C. Under quadratic penalization, $H_1$ and $H_2$ are equivalent because they have the same margin and the same sum of squared slacks; the linear penalization also yields equivalence.**\n- The claim that they have the \"same sum of squared slacks\" is **Incorrect** ($25 \\neq 12.5$).\n- The claim that \"linear penalization also yields equivalence\" is **Incorrect** ($5 \\neq 6$).\n\n**D. The preference between $H_1$ and $H_2$ cannot be determined without kernels or dual variables; margin equality prevents any conclusion.**\n- This statement is **Incorrect**. The problem is fully determined and can be solved by direct calculation in the primal formulation. The equality of margins simplifies the problem by allowing a direct comparison of the slack penalty terms. Kernels and dual variables are tools for solving the SVM optimization problem, not for evaluating pre-defined candidate solutions.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, option B is the only statement that is entirely correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "3147193"}]}
