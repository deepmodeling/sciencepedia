By constructing a dataset that foils the elbow method and then deforming it to create a clear signal, you will gain an intuitive understanding of the conditions under which this heuristic is truly meaningful.", "problem": "You are given the task of evaluating how the within-cluster sum of squares behaves as the number of clusters varies, and of constructing a dataset that is adversarial for the visual \"elbow\"-based selection of the number of clusters. Consider the classical partitioning method that minimizes the total within-cluster sum of squared Euclidean distances. Let a dataset be a finite set of points $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^n \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$. For a given integer $k \\ge 1$, define the within-cluster sum of squares $W(k)$ as the minimum, over all assignments of points to $k$ clusters and all choices of $k$ centroids, of the sum of squared distances from each point to the centroid of its assigned cluster. That is,\n$$\nW(k) \\equiv \\min_{\\text{partitions into }k\\text{ clusters}} \\sum_{c=1}^k \\sum_{x_i \\in C_c} \\|x_i - \\mu_c\\|_2^2,\n$$\nwhere $C_c$ denotes the $c$-th cluster and $\\mu_c$ is the centroid of $C_c$.\n\nYour program must implement an algorithm to approximate $W(k)$ using the standard Lloyd’s iterative refinement (commonly called $k$-means) with careful initialization. You must then construct an adversarial dataset that flattens the curve $W(k)$ over a specified range of $k$ by placing points on a sphere, and also propose and implement a deterministic deformation of that dataset that reintroduces a visible elbow, explaining why the elbow emerges.\n\nUse a two-dimensional setting $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and a unit circle for the sphere construction. Specifically:\n- Generate $n$ points uniformly spaced on the unit circle with radius $r = 1$ by placing points at angles $\\theta_j = \\frac{2\\pi j}{n}$ for $j = 0, 1, \\dots, n - 1$, interpreted in radians, and mapping to Cartesian coordinates via $x_j = (r \\cos \\theta_j, r \\sin \\theta_j)$.\n- To approximate $W(k)$ for a given dataset, implement Lloyd’s algorithm with $k$-means++ style seeding and multiple restarts. Use squared Euclidean distance $\\|\\cdot\\|_2^2$. Handle empty clusters robustly by reinitializing centroids to farthest points when needed. The algorithm must be deterministic given a fixed random seed.\n\nDefine the following quantitative criteria:\n1. Flatline detection. For a contiguous integer range $\\{k_{\\min}, k_{\\min} + 1, \\dots, k_{\\max}\\}$, compute the sequence $W(k)$ and the normalized successive drops\n$$\n\\Delta(k) = \\frac{W(k) - W(k+1)}{W(1)} \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\{k_{\\min}, \\dots, k_{\\max}-1\\}.\n$$\nDeclare the curve \"flatlined over the range\" if $\\max_{k} \\Delta(k) \\le \\tau$ for a given threshold $\\tau \\in (0,1)$.\n\n2. Elbow detection by discrete curvature. For integer $k \\in \\{2, \\dots, K-1\\}$, define the discrete second difference\n$$\nD(k) = W(k-1) - 2 W(k) + W(k+1).\n$$\nReturn the elbow location $k^\\star$ that maximizes $D(k)$ over $k \\in \\{2, \\dots, K-1\\}$. Ties, if any, must be broken by choosing the smallest $k$.\n\nConstruct the adversarial dataset (points on the circle) and a deformed dataset obtained by anisotropic scaling in the vertical direction by a factor $s \\in (0,1)$, i.e., map each point $(x, y)$ to $(x, s y)$ with $s = 0.5$.\n\nYour program must produce outputs for the test suite specified below. Angles are to be interpreted in radians wherever used.\n\nTest suite:\n- Test case $1$ (adversarial flatline check):\n    - Dataset: $n = 360$ points on the unit circle of radius $r = 1$.\n    - Evaluate $W(k)$ for all integers $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 12\\}$.\n    - Flatline detection range: $k_{\\min} = 6$, $k_{\\max} = 12$.\n    - Threshold: $\\tau = 0.025$.\n    - Output: a boolean indicating whether the curve flatlines over $\\{6, 7, \\dots, 12\\}$ under the above criterion.\n\n- Test case $2$ (elbow after deformation):\n    - Dataset: take the same $n = 360$ circle points of radius $r = 1$, then deform by vertical scaling with factor $s = 0.5$.\n    - Evaluate $W(k)$ for all integers $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 12\\}$.\n    - Use the discrete second difference $D(k)$ to select the elbow $k^\\star$ over $\\{2, 3, \\dots, 11\\}$ as described above.\n    - Output: the integer $k^\\star$.\n\n- Test case $3$ (boundary-range non-flatness check):\n    - Dataset: $n = 360$ points on the unit circle of radius $r = 1$.\n    - Evaluate $W(k)$ for all integers $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 12\\}$.\n    - Flatline detection range: $k_{\\min} = 2$, $k_{\\max} = 5$.\n    - Threshold: $\\tau = 0.03$.\n    - Output: a boolean indicating whether the curve flatlines over $\\{2, 3, 4, 5\\}$ under the above criterion.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., \"[result1,result2,result3]\"). The three results must correspond in order to the outputs of test cases $1$, $2$, and $3$ respectively, and must be of types boolean, integer, and boolean.", "solution": "The present task requires a rigorous examination of the within-cluster sum of squares, denoted as $W(k)$, as a function of the number of clusters $k$. This analysis serves to demonstrate the limitations of the \"elbow method,\" a common heuristic for selecting an optimal $k$, by constructing a dataset for which the method fails and a modification of that dataset for which it succeeds.\n\n### Principle 1: Within-Cluster Sum of Squares and $k$-means Clustering\n\nA dataset is given as a collection of $n$ points $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ in a $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, $\\mathbb{R}^d$. The goal of partitioning-based clustering is to group these points into $k$ distinct, non-empty sets or clusters, $\\{C_1, C_2, \\dots, C_k\\}$, that are collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive.\n\nThe standard objective function for this task is the total within-cluster sum of squares ($WSS$), which measures the compactness of the clusters. For a given partition, it is the sum of squared Euclidean distances from each point to the centroid of its assigned cluster. The centroid $\\mu_c$ of a cluster $C_c$ is its arithmetic mean: $\\mu_c = \\frac{1}{|C_c|} \\sum_{x_i \\in C_c} x_i$.\n\nThe quantity $W(k)$ is defined as the minimum possible $WSS$ over all possible partitions of the data into $k$ clusters:\n$$\nW(k) \\equiv \\min_{\\{C_c\\}_{c=1}^k} \\sum_{c=1}^k \\sum_{x_i \\in C_c} \\|x_i - \\mu_c\\|_2^2\n$$\nFinding the true global minimum of this function is an NP-hard problem. Therefore, iterative heuristic algorithms are employed to find a good local minimum. The most common of these is Lloyd's algorithm, often referred to as the $k$-means algorithm.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Initialization**: Choose $k$ initial centroids. A judicious choice is critical for a good result. The $k$-means++ seeding strategy is a proven method that tends to select well-separated initial centroids, improving both the quality and convergence speed of the algorithm.\n2.  **Iteration**: Repeat the following two steps until convergence.\n    a.  **Assignment Step**: Assign each data point $x_i$ to the cluster $C_c$ corresponding to the nearest centroid $\\mu_c$, i.e., where $\\|x_i - \\mu_c\\|_2^2$ is minimized.\n    b.  **Update Step**: Recalculate the centroid $\\mu_c$ for each cluster as the mean of all points assigned to it.\n3.  **Termination**: The algorithm has converged when the cluster assignments no longer change between iterations.\n\nDue to the algorithm's sensitivity to initial conditions, it is standard practice to run it multiple times with different random initializations (restarts) and select the clustering that yields the minimum $W(k)$.\n\n### Principle 2: The \"Elbow Method\" and its Adversarial Case\n\nThe function $W(k)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $k$. As $k$ increases, points are partitioned into smaller, more numerous clusters, inevitably reducing the sum of squared distances to their respective centroids. $W(1)$ is the total sum of squares of the data with respect to the global mean, and $W(n) = 0$ if all points are distinct.\n\nThe elbow method is a visual heuristic used to estimate a \"good\" value for $k$. One plots $W(k)$ against $k$ and looks for an \"elbow\" point, where the rate of decrease of $W(k)$ sharply abates. The intuition is that this point represents a trade-off between model complexity (more clusters) and explanatory power (lower $WSS$).\n\nAn **adversarial dataset** for this method is one that does not produce a clear elbow. A canonical example is a set of points distributed with high symmetry, such as being uniformly spaced on a sphere. In the specified $\\mathbb{R}^2$ case, we use $n = 360$ points on a unit circle of radius $r = 1$, with coordinates $(r \\cos \\theta_j, r \\sin \\theta_j)$ for angles $\\theta_j = \\frac{2\\pi j}{n}$.\n\nThe rotational symmetry of this dataset means there is no intrinsically \"correct\" number of clusters (other than $k=1$ or $k=n$). The optimal placement of $k$ centroids will tend towards a regular $k$-gon inscribed within the circle. As $k$ increases, the reduction in $W(k)$ is very smooth and gradual. There is no point where adding another cluster provides a disproportionately large benefit, thus the $W(k)$ curve lacks a distinct elbow. This is quantified by the normalized successive drop, $\\Delta(k) = \\frac{W(k) - W(k+1)}{W(1)}$. For the circle data, this value is expected to be small and to change slowly over ranges of $k$, causing the curve to appear \"flatlined\" according to the problem's criterion.\n\n### Principle 3: Reintroducing Structure via Anisotropic Scaling\n\nTo restore a salient elbow, one must break the symmetry of the dataset. The problem proposes an anisotropic scaling transformation, mapping each point $(x, y)$ to $(x, s y)$ with a scaling factor $s = 0.5$. This transforms the unit circle into an ellipse with semi-major axis $1$ along the $x$-axis and semi-minor axis $0.5$ along the $y$-axis.\n\nThis deformation has a critical effect on the point distribution. While the points remain ordered as they were on the circle, the Euclidean distance between consecutive points changes. The points become densely packed near the high-curvature ends of the ellipse at $(\\pm 1, 0)$ and become sparser near the low-curvature top and bottom at $(0, \\pm 0.5)$.\n\nThis creates a clear structural feature: two dense groups of points. A clustering with $k=2$ can effectively capture this structure by placing one centroid in each high-density region. This results in a very significant reduction in $WSS$ when moving from $k=1$ (a single centroid at the origin) to $k=2$. For $k>2$, the subsequent reductions in $WSS$ are less dramatic. This sharp, initial drop followed by a more gradual decrease creates a prominent elbow at $k=2$.\n\nThis visual elbow can be detected quantitatively by finding the maximum of the discrete second difference, $D(k) = W(k-1) - 2W(k) + W(k+1)$. This value is an approximation of the second derivative and is large at points of high convexity, such as an elbow. We thus expect $k^\\star = \\arg\\max_k D(k)$ to be $2$ for the deformed dataset.\n\n### Algorithmic Implementation Strategy\n\nThe solution will be implemented as a Python program structured as follows:\n\n1.  **Data Generation**: A function will generate the two required datasets: $n=360$ points on a unit circle and the anisotropically scaled version of these points.\n2.  **$k$-means Algorithm**: A core function will implement the $k$-means algorithm.\n    -   It will use multiple restarts to ensure a high-quality solution.\n    -   Each run will be initialized using the $k$-means++ seeding method for deterministic and robust behavior, controlled by a master random seed.\n    -   The iterative process will handle empty clusters by re-seeding the empty cluster's centroid to a data point that is farthest from any of the existing non-empty centroids.\n3.  **$W(k)$ Computation**: A wrapper function will compute the entire $W(k)$ curve for a given dataset over the a specified range of $k$ values by repeatedly calling the $k$-means function.\n4.  **Test Case Evaluation**:\n    -   **Flatline Check**: A function will implement the criterion $\\max_{k} \\Delta(k) \\le \\tau$ by computing the normalized drops over the specified range for the circle dataset.\n    -   **Elbow Detection**: A function will compute the discrete second differences $D(k)$ for the deformed dataset and find the $k^\\star$ that maximizes this value, with ties broken by selecting the smaller $k$.\n5.  **Main Execution**: The main part of the script will orchestrate these components to execute the three test cases, collect the results (two booleans and one integer), and print them in the specified format.

The experiment must be implemented as a complete, runnable program. The key objects of interest are the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) and the effect of feature scaling on Euclidean distances.\n\nUse the following foundational base:\n- Euclidean $k$-means minimizes the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) defined by $$W(k) \\;=\\; \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left\\| x_i - \\mu_{\\mathrm{cluster}(i)} \\right\\|_2^2,$$ where $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ is the $i$-th data vector, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{cluster}(i)}$ is the centroid of the cluster to which $x_i$ is assigned, $n$ is the number of samples, $d$ is the number of features, and $k$ is the number of clusters.\n- Feature-wise normalization to unit variance means transforming each feature $j \\in \\{1,\\dots,d\\}$ using $$x_{ij}' \\;=\\; \\frac{x_{ij} - \\bar{x}_j}{s_j},$$ where $\\bar{x}_j$ is the sample mean of feature $j$ and $s_j$ is its sample standard deviation.

The remaining $9$ features are independent Gaussian noise with standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{noise}} = 5$ and zero mean.\n\n- Test Case $3$ (edge case with a zero-variance feature):\n  - Dimensionality $d = 3$.\n  - True number of clusters $c = 3$.\n  - Samples per cluster $n_c = 40$ (total $n = 120$).\n  - Random seed $= 777$.\n  - Cluster construction: Feature $1$ is constant at $0$ for all samples (zero variance).

All numeric answers are integers. Ensure the program is self-contained, deterministic given the specified seeds, and uses only the specified libraries.", "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective computational problem within the domain of statistical learning. All parameters, definitions, and procedures are specified unambiguously, allowing for a unique and reproducible solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds by implementing the specified experiment, which involves several interconnected components: synthetic data generation, feature normalization, a robust implementation of the $k$-means algorithm, and a geometric method for elbow detection.\n\n**1. Foundational Principles**\n\nThe core of the problem lies at the intersection of clustering algorithms and data preprocessing. The Euclidean $k$-means algorithm aims to minimize the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS), an objective function sensitive to the scale of the features.\n\n- **Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS):** For a given number of clusters $k$, the WCSS is defined as\n$$W(k) \\;=\\; \\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\sum_{x_i \\in C_j} \\left\\| x_i - \\mu_j \\right\\|_2^2$$\nwhere $C_j$ is the set of data points in the $j$-th cluster, $\\mu_j$ is the centroid of cluster $C_j$, and $\\| \\cdot \\|_2$ is the Euclidean norm. Since the Euclidean norm sums the squared differences along each dimension, features with larger numerical ranges or variances can disproportionately influence the total distance, potentially masking underlying structure in other features.\n\n- **Feature Normalization:** To mitigate this, features are often scaled. The problem specifies normalization to unit variance (standardization). For each feature $j$, the transformation is\n$$x_{ij}' \\;=\\; \\frac{x_{ij} - \\bar{x}_j}{s_j}$$\nwhere $\\bar{x}_j$ is the sample mean and $s_j$ is the sample standard deviation of feature $j$. The sample standard deviation is calculated as $s_j = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_{ij}-\\bar{x}_j)^2}$. This transformation gives each feature a mean of $0$ and a standard deviation of $1$. The problem specifies that if a feature has zero variance ($s_j = 0$), it should be left unchanged, i.e., $x_{ij}' = x_{ij}$.\n\n**2. Algorithmic Implementation**\n\nThe overall experiment is encapsulated in a program that systematically executes the required steps for each of the three test cases.\n\n- **Data Generation:** For each test case, a synthetic dataset is generated according to the precise specifications using a seeded random number generator (`numpy.random.default_rng`) to ensure reproducibility. The parameters (dimensionality $d$, true clusters $c$, samples per cluster $n_c$, means, and standard deviations) are used to construct data matrices where the clustering structure is known a priori.\n\n- **$k$-means Algorithm:** A robust implementation of Euclidean $k$-means is developed based on Lloyd's algorithm.\n    - **Initialization:** To start an iteration of Lloyd's algorithm, $k$ initial centroids are chosen by randomly selecting $k$ distinct data points from the dataset (Forgy method).\n    - **Iteration:** The algorithm proceeds in two steps:\n        1. **Assignment Step:** Each data point $x_i$ is assigned to the cluster corresponding to the nearest centroid, minimizing $\\| x_i - \\mu_j \\|_2^2$. This is efficiently computed using squared Euclidean distances.\n        2. **Update Step:** The centroid $\\mu_j$ of each cluster is recalculated as the mean of all data points assigned to it. If a cluster becomes empty, its centroid position is retained from the previous iteration to maintain stability and a constant number of clusters.\n    - **Convergence:** The iterative process stops when the centroid positions no longer change between iterations or a maximum number of iterations ($300$) is reached.\n    - **Robustness:** To avoid poor local minima, which are common in $k$-means, the entire Lloyd's algorithm is run $5$ times (restarts) with different random initializations. The clustering that yields the minimum WCSS, $W(k)$, across these restarts is chosen as the result for that value of $k$.\n\n- **Elbow Detection:** The \"elbow\" in the WCSS curve is a heuristic for the optimal number of clusters. The problem defines a deterministic method to locate it.\n    - A series of points $p_k = (k, W(k))$ is generated by running the $k$-means algorithm for each $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, K_{\\max}\\}$.\n    - A straight line $L$ is defined passing through the first point $p_1 = (1, W(1))$ and the last point $p_{K_{\\max}} = (K_{\\max}, W(K_{\\max}))$.\n    - For each intermediate point $p_k$ where $k \\in \\{2, \\dots, K_{\\max}-1\\}$, the perpendicular distance to the line $L$ is calculated. The distance from a point $p_0$ to a line defined by points $p_a$ and $p_b$ can be found using the formula for the area of a parallelogram:\n    $$ \\text{distance} = \\frac{|\\det(\\vec{v}, \\vec{w})|}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|} = \\frac{|v_x w_y - v_y w_x|}{\\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}} $$\n    where $\\vec{v} = p_b - p_a$ and $\\vec{w} = p_0 - p_a$.\n    - The elbow index $\\hat{k}$ is the value of $k$ that maximizes this perpendicular distance.\n\n- **Experimental Procedure:** For each of the three test cases, this entire process is performed twice: once on the raw, unscaled data and once on the data after applying feature-wise normalization to unit variance. The resulting six elbow indices ($\\hat{k}_{1,\\mathrm{raw}}, \\hat{k}_{1,\\mathrm{norm}}, \\hat{k}_{2,\\mathrm{raw}}, \\hat{k}_{2,\\mathrm{norm}}, \\hat{k}_{3,\\mathrm{raw}}, \\hat{k}_{3,\\mathrm{norm}}$) are collected and presented as the final output. The experiment is designed to demonstrate how normalization can either reveal hidden cluster structures (Test Case 1) or obscure them by amplifying noise (Test Case 2), while also correctly handling edge cases like zero-variance features (Test Case 3).", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.spatial.distance import cdist\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements and runs the experiment to quantify the effect of feature normalization\n    on elbow detection in k-means clustering.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def generate_data(case_id, d, c, n_c, rng):\n        \"\"\"Generates synthetic dataset for a given test case.\"\"\"\n        n_total = c * n_c\n        \n        if case_id == 1:\n            # Case 1: Normalization reveals the elbow\n            # Feature 1: High-variance noise\n            # Feature 2: Low-variance signal\n            x1 = rng.normal(loc=0, scale=12, size=n_total)\n            x2 = np.zeros(n_total)\n            means = [-6, 0, 6]\n            sigma_y = 0.6\n            for i, mean in enumerate(means):\n                start, end = i * n_c, (i + 1) * n_c\n                x2[start:end] = rng.normal(loc=mean, scale=sigma_y, size=n_c)\n            X = np.stack((x1, x2), axis=1)\n            \n        elif case_id == 2:\n            # Case 2: Normalization obscures the elbow\n            # Feature 1: Signal\n            # Features 2-10: Moderate-variance noise\n            x_sig = np.zeros(n_total)\n            means = [-12, 0, 12]\n            sigma_sig = 0.5\n            for i, mean in enumerate(means):\n                start, end = i * n_c, (i + 1) * n_c\n                x_sig[start:end] = rng.normal(loc=mean, scale=sigma_sig, size=n_c)\n            \n            x_noise = rng.normal(loc=0, scale=5, size=(n_total, d -

That is, $j = \\arg\\min_{l \\in \\{1,\\dots,k\\}} \\|x_i - \\mu_l\\|^2$.\n3.  **Update Step**: Recalculate each centroid $\\mu_j$ as the mean of all data points assigned to cluster $C_j$.\nThese two steps are repeated until the cluster assignments no longer change. The value of $W(k)$ is guaranteed to be nonincreasing at each iteration. However, the algorithm may converge to a local minimum of the objective function. To mitigate this, the entire process is typically run multiple times ($r$ restarts) with different random initializations, and the solution yielding the lowest $W(k)$ is chosen.\n\nAs the number of clusters $k$ increases, the WCSS $W(k)$ is a nonincreasing function. In the extreme case where $k=n$, each point forms its own cluster, and the WCSS becomes $0$. A plot of $W(k)$ versus $k$ typically shows a sharp initial drop followed by a flattening, forming a shape resembling an \"elbow\". The optimal number of clusters is often heuristically identified as the \"elbow point\", where adding more clusters provides diminishing returns in terms of WCSS reduction.\n\n**The Selection Heuristic**\n\nThe problem defines a specific quantitative rule to locate this elbow. It involves computing the ratio $R(k)$ for $k \\in \\{2, 3, \\dots, K_{\\max}-1\\}$:\n$$\nR(k) \\equiv \\frac{W(k-1) - W(k)}{W(k) - W(k+1)}\n$$\nThe numerator, $W(k-1) - W(k)$, represents the reduction in WCSS achieved by increasing the number of clusters from $k-1$ to $k$. The denominator, $W(k) - W(k+1)$, represents the subsequent reduction from $k$ to $k+1$. A large value of $R(k)$ indicates that the benefit of adding the $k$-th cluster is substantially greater than the benefit of adding the $(k+1)$-th cluster. This is precisely the \"elbow\" condition: the curve of WCSS versus $k$ is much steeper before point $k$ than after it.\n\nThe selection rule is defined as:\n1.  Choose the smallest integer $k \\in \\{2, \\dots, K_{\\max}-1\\}$ for which $R(k) \\ge \\gamma$, where $\\gamma  0$ is a specified threshold.\n2.  If no such $k$ exists, then select the $k$ within the range $\\{2, \\dots, K_{\\max}-1\\}$ that maximizes the ratio $R(k)$. In case of a tie for the maximum value, the smallest $k$ is chosen.\n\nA special case is handled for the denominator: if $W(k) - W(k+1)$ is numerically close to zero (less than or equal to a tolerance of $10^{-12}$), we interpret $R(k)$ as $+\\infty$. This correctly captures the situation where the WCSS has plateaued, making $k$ a strong candidate for the elbow point.\n\n**Algorithmic Procedure**\n\nThe implementation will follow these steps for each test case:\n\n1.  **Data Generation**: For a given separation $s$, per-cluster sample size $n_c$, and dimension $d=2$, generate a dataset of $n=3n_c$ points. The data is drawn from a mixture of three Gaussian distributions with means $\\mu_1 = (-s, 0)$, $\\mu_2 = (s, 0)$, and $\\mu_3 = (0, s)$, and a shared isotropic covariance matrix $\\sigma^2 I_2$ with $\\sigma=1$. A fixed random number generator seed is used to ensure reproducibility.\n\n2.  **WCSS Curve Computation**: For each integer $k$ from $1$ to $K_{\\max}$:\n    a. Initialize a variable `min_wcss` to infinity.\n    b. Perform $r$ independent runs of Lloyd's $k$-means algorithm. For each run:\n        i.   Initialize $k$ centroids by selecting $k$ distinct data points from $X$ at random.\n        ii.  Iteratively perform the assignment and update steps until convergence (i.e., cluster assignments are stable).\n        iii. A critical detail is handling empty clusters. If, during an update step, a cluster has no assigned points, its centroid is reinitialized by selecting a new random data point from $X$. This ensures the number of active clusters remains $k$.\n        iv.  Upon convergence, calculate the WCSS for the final partition.\n        v.   Update `min_wcss = min(min_wcss, current_wcss)`.\n    c. Store the resulting `min_wcss` as the value $W(k)$.\n\n3.  **Optimal $k$ Selection**:\n    a. Using the computed sequence $W(1), W(2), \\dots, W(K_{\\max})$, calculate the ratios $R(k)$ for $k \\in \\{2, \\dots, K_{\\max}-1\\}$ according to the specified formula, including the special handling for near-zero denominators.\n    b. Iterate from $k=2$ to $K_{\\max}-1$ to find the first $k$ that satisfies $R(k) \\ge \\gamma$. If found, this $k$ is the result.\n    c. If the loop completes without finding such a $k$, find the $k$ that maximizes $R(k)$. The tie-breaking rule (smallest $k$) is naturally handled by standard methods for finding the index of a maximum value. This $k$ is then the result.\n\nThis complete procedure is applied to each of the four parameter sets defined in the problem statement.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef run_kmeans(X, k, num_restarts, max_iter, rng):\n    \"\"\"\n    Runs the k-means algorithm with multiple restarts and returns the best result.\n    \n    Args:\n        X (np.ndarray): The data matrix, shape (n_samples, n_features).\n        k (int): The number of clusters.\n        num_restarts (int): The number of times to run k-means with different initializations.\n        max_iter (int): The maximum number of iterations for a single run.\n        rng (np.random.Generator): The random number generator for reproducibility.\n        \n    Returns:\n        float: The minimum WCSS found across all restarts.\n    \"\"\"\n    n_samples, n_features = X.shape\n    min_wcss = np.inf\n\n    for _ in range(num_restarts):\n        # Initialize centroids by choosing k random points from X without replacement\n        initial_indices = rng.choice(n_samples, k, replace=False)\n        centroids = X[initial_indices]\n        \n        prev_assignments = np.zeros(n_samples, dtype=int) - 1\n\n        for iteration in range(max_iter):\n            # Assignment step\n            # Calculate squared Euclidean distances from each point to each centroid\n            # Shape: (n_samples, k)\n            dist_sq = np.sum((X[:, np.newaxis, :] - centroids[np.newaxis, :, :]) ** 2, axis=2)\n            assignments = np.argmin(dist_sq, axis=1)\n\n            # Check for convergence\n            if np.array_equal(assignments, prev_assignments):\n                break\n            prev_assignments = assignments\n\n            # Update step\n            new_centroids = np.zeros((k, n_features))\n            counts = np.zeros(k, dtype=int)\n            \n            # Efficiently sum points for each cluster\n            np.add.at(new_centroids, assignments, X)\n            counts = np.bincount(assignments, minlength=k)\n            \n            non_empty_mask = counts > 0\n            empty_mask = ~non_empty_mask\n            \n            # Calculate means for non-empty clusters\n            new_centroids[non_empty_mask] /= counts[non_empty_mask, np.newaxis]\n            \n            # Handle empty clusters by re-initializing centroids to random data points\n            num_empty = np.sum(empty_mask)\n            if num_empty > 0:\n                random_points_indices = rng.choice(n_samples, num_empty, replace=True)\n                new_centroids[empty_mask] = X[random_points_indices]\n            \n            centroids = new_centroids\n        \n        # Calculate WCSS for the converged clustering\n        current_wcss = 0.0\n        for j in range(k):\n            cluster_points = X[assignments == j]\n            if len(cluster_points) > 0:\n                current_wcss += np.sum((cluster_points - centroids[j]) ** 2)\n        \n        if current_wcss  min_wcss:\n            min_wcss = current_wcss\n            \n    return min_wcss\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run the cluster selection algorithm for all test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Fixed seed for reproducibility\n    rng = np.random.default_rng(seed=12345)\n    max_iter_kmeans = 100 # Set a reasonable max iteration count for Lloyd's\n    den_tolerance = 1e-12\n\n    # (n_c, s, gamma, K_max, r)\n    test_cases = [\n        (200, 4.0, 1.3, 8, 10),\n        (200, 2.5, 1.2, 8, 10),\n        (200, 1.0, 1.2, 8, 10),\n        (200, 0.0, 1.2, 8, 10),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case_params in test_cases:\n        n_c, s, gamma, K_max, r = case_params\n        \n        # 1.
