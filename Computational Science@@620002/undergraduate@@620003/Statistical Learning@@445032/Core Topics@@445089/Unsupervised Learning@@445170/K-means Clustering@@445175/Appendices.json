The algorithm iterates two steps: an assignment step that maps each data point to the nearest centroid using the Euclidean distance in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, and an update step that recomputes each centroid as the arithmetic mean of the points currently assigned to its cluster. Let $n$ denote the number of points, $k$ the number of clusters, $d$ the dimension, and $t$ the number of iterations until convergence (defined as no change in assignments). The fundamental base for analysis should be the following well-tested facts: in each assignment step, for each of the $n$ points, the distance to each of the $k$ centroids in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ is computed using the Euclidean norm, and in each update step, each centroid is updated by computing the mean of the points assigned to it.\n\nTask:\n- Derive the computational complexity of one iteration of Lloyd’s algorithm starting from these facts and the definitions of Euclidean distance and arithmetic mean, and use this derivation to justify the asymptotic complexity $O(n k d t)$ for the total algorithm until convergence.\n- Implement Lloyd’s algorithm for $k$-means clustering as described above, using the Euclidean distance in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ and convergence based on unchanged assignments.

It presents a standard but non-trivial task in algorithm analysis and implementation.\n\n### Part 1: Computational Complexity Derivation\n\nThe total computational complexity of Lloyd's algorithm is the product of the number of iterations, $t$, and the complexity of a single iteration. An iteration consists of two sequential steps: the assignment step and the update step. We derive the complexity of each step based on the provided a priori facts.\n\nLet $n$ be the number of data points, $k$ be the number of clusters, and $d$ be the dimension of the data space $\\mathbb{R}^d$.\n\n**Assignment Step Complexity**\n\nThe problem states that in the assignment step, \"for each of the $n$ points, the distance to each of the $k$ centroids in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ is computed using the Euclidean norm\".\n\n1.  **Distance Calculation**: The Euclidean distance between a data point $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, \\dots, x_d)$ and a centroid $\\mathbf{c} = (c_1, \\dots, c_d)$ is given by $D(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{c}) = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{d} (x_i - c_i)^2}$. To compute this value, we perform:\n    *   $d$ subtractions ($x_i - c_i$).\n    *   $d$ multiplications (squaring).\n    *   $d-1$ additions (summation).\n    *   $1$ square root operation.\n    The total number of arithmetic operations is $d+d+(d-1)+1 = 3d$. Thus, the complexity of a single distance calculation is proportional to the dimension $d$, which is $O(d)$. Note that for the purpose of finding the *nearest* centroid, we can work with the squared Euclidean distance, $D^2(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{c}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{d} (x_i - c_i)^2$, which avoids the computationally more expensive square root operation but has the same $O(d)$ complexity.\n\n2.  **Total Assignment Cost**: For each of the $n$ data points, we compute its distance to all $k$ centroids. This requires $n \\times k$ distance calculations. The total cost for all distance calculations is therefore $n \\times k \\times O(d) = O(nkd)$.\n\n3.  **Finding the Minimum**: For each data point, after computing its distances to the $k$ centroids, we must find the minimum of these $k$ values to determine the assignment. This requires $k-1$ comparisons, an operation of complexity $O(k)$. Since this must be done for all $n$ points, the total complexity for finding all minima is $n \\times O(k) = O(nk)$.\n\n4.  **Overall Assignment Complexity**: The total complexity of the assignment step is the sum of the costs of distance calculations and finding the minima: $O(nkd) + O(nk)$. Since $d \\ge 1$, the $O(nkd)$ term dominates. Therefore, the complexity of the assignment step is $O(nkd)$.\n\n**Update Step Complexity**\n\nThe problem states that in the update step, \"each centroid is updated by computing the mean of the points assigned to it\".\n\n1.  **Mean Calculation**: Let cluster $j$ contain $n_j$ points, denoted $\\{\\mathbf{x}_{j,1}, \\dots, \\mathbf{x}_{j, n_j}\\}$. The new centroid $\\mathbf{c}_j'$ is their arithmetic mean: $\\mathbf{c}_j' = \\frac{1}{n_j} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_j} \\mathbf{x}_{j,i}$.\n    *   To compute the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{n_j} \\mathbf{x}_{j,i}$, we are summing $n_j$ vectors, each of dimension $d$. This requires $(n_j - 1) \\times d$ additions. The complexity is $O(n_j d)$.\n    *   To compute the final mean, we divide the resulting sum vector by the scalar $n_j$. This involves $d$ divisions, an operation of complexity $O(d)$.\n    *   The total complexity to update one centroid for cluster $j$ is $O(n_j d) + O(d) = O(n_j d)$.\n\n2.  **Total Update Cost**: We must perform this update for all $k$ clusters. The total complexity is the sum of the costs for each cluster: $\\sum_{j=1}^{k} O(n_j d)$. This can be written as $O(d \\sum_{j=1}^{k} n_j)$.\n    Since each of the $n$ data points is assigned to exactly one cluster, the sum of the number of points in all clusters is equal to the total number of points: $\\sum_{j=1}^{k} n_j = n$.\n    Therefore, the complexity of the update step is $O(nd)$.\n\nThe special rule for handling empty clusters requires finding the data point with the largest distance to its assigned centroid. This involves a scan through $n$ pre-computed distances, which is an $O(n)$ operation. This cost is incurred only if a cluster is empty and is dominated by the $O(nd)$ cost of the standard update process (since $d \\ge 1$), so it does not alter the asymptotic complexity of the update step.\n\n**Total Complexity**\n\nThe complexity of a single iteration of Lloyd's algorithm is the sum of the complexities of the assignment and update steps:\n$$ C_{\\text{iteration}} = C_{\\text{assignment}} + C_{\\text{update}} = O(nkd) + O(nd) $$\nSince $k \\ge 1$, the term $O(nkd)$ dominates $O(nd)$. Thus, the complexity of one iteration is $O(nkd)$.\n\nIf the algorithm runs for $t$ iterations until convergence, the total computational complexity is:\n$$ C_{\\text{total}} = t \\times C_{\\text{iteration}} = t \\times O(nkd) = O(nkdt) $$\nThis justifies the asymptotic complexity of $O(nkdt)$ for the entire algorithm.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.spatial.distance import cdist\n\ndef lloyds_algorithm(data, k, initial_centroids):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs k-means clustering using Lloyd's algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        data (np.ndarray): The dataset of shape (n, d).\n        k (int): The number of clusters.\n        initial_centroids (np.ndarray): The initial centroids of shape (k, d).\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of iterations 't' until convergence.\n    \"\"\"\n    n, d = data.shape\n    centroids = np.copy(initial_centroids)\n    # Initialize assignments with a sentinel value that won't match any valid assignment\n    assignments = np.full(n, -1, dtype=int)\n    \n    t = 0\n    while True:\n        # --- Assignment Step ---\n        # Compute squared Euclidean distances from each point to each centroid\n        # cdist is efficient for this.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n---\n\n### **Theoretical Derivations**\n\nThis section provides the mathematical derivations required by the problem statement.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Weighted Centroid Update Rule**\n\nThe objective of weighted $k$-means is to find the set of centroids $\\{\\mu_k\\}_{k=1}^K$ and assignments $\\{r_{ik}\\}$ that minimize the within-cluster sum of squared distances, where each point's contribution is scaled by a weight $w_i$. The objective function $J$ is:\n$$\nJ(\\{\\mu_k\\}, \\{r_{ik}\\}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{k=1}^K r_{ik} w_i \\|x_i - \\mu_k\\|^2\n$$\nThe $k$-means algorithm minimizes this function iteratively. In the centroid update step (the M-step), the assignments $\\{r_{ik}\\}$ are fixed, and we seek to find the centroids $\\{\\mu_k\\}$ that minimize $J$. Since the terms for different clusters are independent, we can minimize the objective for each cluster separately.\n\nLet's focus on updating a single centroid, $\\mu_k$. We only need to consider the part of the objective function that depends on $\\mu_k$, which we denote $J_k$:\n$$\nJ_k = \\sum_{i=1}^n r_{ik} w_i \\|x_i - \\mu_k\\|^2\n$$\nHere, $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\\mu_k \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$. The squared Euclidean norm is $\\|x_i - \\mu_k\\|^2 = (x_i - \\mu_k)^T(x_i - \\mu_k)$. To find the minimum, we compute the gradient of $J_k$ with respect to $\\mu_k$ and set it to zero.\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\mu_k} J_k = \\nabla_{\\mu_k} \\sum_{i=1}^n r_{ik} w_i (x_i - \\mu_k)^T(x_i - \\mu_k)\n$$\nUsing the linearity of the gradient operator and the identity $\\nabla_v (u-v)^T(u-v) = -2(u-v)$, we get:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\mu_k} J_k = \\sum_{i=1}^n r_{ik} w_i \\nabla_{\\mu_k} (\\|x_i - \\mu_k\\|^2) = \\sum_{i=1}^n r_{ik} w_i [-2(x_i - \\mu_k)]\n$$\nSetting the gradient to zero to find the optimal $\\mu_k$:\n$$\n-2 \\sum_{i=1}^n r_{ik} w_i (x_i - \\mu_k) = 0\n$$\nAssuming not all points assigned to cluster $k$ have zero weight, we can divide by $-2$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^n r_{ik} w_i x_i - \\sum_{i=1}^n r_{ik} w_i \\mu_k = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n r_{ik} w_i\\right) \\mu_k = \\sum_{i=1}^n r_{ik} w_i x_i\n$$\nSolving for $\\mu_k$, we obtain the centroid update rule:\n$$\n\\mu_k = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n r_{ik} w_i x_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^n r_{ik} w_i}\n$$\nThis shows that the optimal centroid for a cluster is the weighted average of the data points assigned to that cluster. If the denominator is zero (i.e., no points with positive weight are assigned to the cluster), the centroid is undefined and typically left unchanged or re-initialized.\n\n**Explanation of Weight-Independence in the Assignment Step:**\nIn the assignment step (the E-step), the centroids $\\{\\mu_k\\}$ are fixed. For each data point $x_i$, we must assign it to the cluster that minimizes its contribution to the total objective $J$. The contribution of point $x_i$ is $\\sum_{k=1}^K r_{ik} w_i \\|x_i - \\mu_k\\|^2$. Since exactly one $r_{ik}$ is $1$ (and others are $0$), this contribution becomes $w_i \\|x_i - \\mu_c\\|^2$, where $c$ is the index of the assigned cluster.\n\nTo minimize this term for a given point $x_i$, we must choose the cluster index $c$ that minimizes $w_i \\|x_i - \\mu_c\\|^2$.\n- If $w_i > 0$, the weight $w_i$ is a positive constant factor. Minimizing $w_i \\|x_i - \\mu_c\\|^2$ is equivalent to minimizing $\\|x_i - \\mu_c\\|^2$ (or its square root, the Euclidean distance).\n- If $w_i = 0$, the contribution of point $x_i$ to the objective is always zero, regardless of its assignment. The assignment is therefore arbitrary and has no impact on the objective function or subsequent centroid updates.\n\nIn either case, the decision rule for assigning a point to a cluster depends only on finding the nearest centroid in terms of Euclidean distance, not on the specific value of the weight $w_i$.\n\n**2. Proof of Equivalence for Integer Weights**\n\nWe will now prove that for a set of nonnegative integer weights $\\{w_i\\}_{i=1}^n$, the weighted $k$-means objective is identical to the standard (unweighted) $k$-means objective on a dataset where each point $x_i$ is duplicated $w_i$ times.\n\nLet the original dataset be $X = \\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^n$. Let the integer weights be $W = \\{w_i\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $w_i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$.\nConstruct a new, duplicated dataset $X' = \\{x'_j\\}_{j=1}^{N'}$, where $N' = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i$. This new dataset contains $w_i$ copies of each point $x_i$. We can define a mapping $\\phi: \\{1, \\dots, N'\\} \\to \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ such that $x'_j = x_{\\phi(j)}$. The set of indices $j$ that map to a given $i$ (i.e., the preimage $\\phi^{-1}(i)$) has size $|\\phi^{-1}(i)| = w_i$.\n\nThe unweighted $k$-means objective for the duplicated dataset $X'$ is:\n$$\nJ'_{unweighted} = \\sum_{j=1}^{N'} \\sum_{k=1}^K r'_{jk} \\|x'_j - \\mu_k\\|^2\n$$\nwhere $r'_{jk} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ are the hard assignments for the points in $X'$.\n\nFor any point $x'_j$ in the duplicated dataset, its location is $x_{\\phi(j)}$. The cluster assignment for $x'_j$ is determined by finding the centroid $\\mu_k$ that is closest in Euclidean distance. Since all duplicates of a given point $x_i$ are at the same location, they will all be assigned to the same cluster. That is, for any $j_1, j_2$ such that $\\phi(j_1) = \\phi(j_2) = i$, we will have $r'_{j_1,k} = r'_{j_2,k} = r_{ik}$ for all $k=1, \\dots, K$.\n\nWe can now rewrite the objective $J'_{unweighted}$ by grouping the sum over $j$ according to the original points $x_i$:\n$$\nJ'_{unweighted} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j \\in \\phi^{-1}(i)} \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^K r'_{jk} \\|x'_j - \\mu_k\\|^2 \\right)\n$$\nWithin the inner sum over $j \\in \\phi^{-1}(i)$, we know that $x'_j = x_i$ and $r'_{jk} = r_{ik}$. Substituting these in:\n$$\nJ'_{unweighted} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j \\in \\phi^{-1}(i)} \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^K r_{ik} \\|x_i - \\mu_k\\|^2 \\right)\n$$\nThe term $\\sum_{k=1}^K r_{ik} \\|x_i - \\mu_k\\|^2$ is constant for all $j$ in the set $\\phi^{-1}(i)$. The size of this set is $w_i$. Therefore, the sum over $j \\in \\phi^{-1}(i)$ simplifies to multiplying by the size of the set:\n$$\n\\sum_{j \\in \\phi^{-1}(i)} \\left( \\dots \\right) = w_i \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^K r_{ik} \\|x_i - \\mu_k\\|^2 \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $J'_{unweighted}$:\n$$\nJ'_{unweighted} = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^K r_{ik} \\|x_i - \\mu_k\\|^2 \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{k=1}^K r_{ik} w_i \\|x_i - \\mu_k\\|^2\n$$\nThis is precisely the weighted objective function $J_{weighted}$. Since the objective functions are identical, their minimization with respect to $\\{\\mu_k\\}$ must yield the same solution. Thus, the centroid update rule derived from the unweighted objective on the duplicated dataset is equivalent to the weighted update rule on the original dataset, which confirms the conclusion that the centroid updates coincide.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Formalizes, implements, and tests weighted k-means clustering.\n    - Derives weighted centroid updates.\n    - Proves equivalence with duplicated-unweighted data for integer weights.\n    - Runs four test cases to validate theory and measure centroid drift.\n    \"\"\"\n    epsilon = 1e-12\n\n    # Helper function to format results for the final print statement.\n    def format_result(item):\n        if isinstance(item, list):\n            # Format the list of floats to 6 decimal places, no spaces.\n            return f\"[{','.join(f'{x:.6f}' for x in item)}]\"\n        elif isinstance(item, bool):\n            # Python's bool __str__ returns 'True' or 'False'.
