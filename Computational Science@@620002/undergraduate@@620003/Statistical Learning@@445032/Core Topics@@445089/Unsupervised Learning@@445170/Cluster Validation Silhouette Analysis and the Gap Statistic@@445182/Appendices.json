By working through the mathematics, you will gain a concrete understanding of how cluster separation ($\\Delta$), within-cluster spread ($b$), and dimensionality ($d$) influence silhouette scores, and appreciate why the choice of distance metric ($L_1$ versus $L_2$) is critical when dealing with data that has heavy tails.", "problem": "Consider a binary mixture model in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ with two equally likely clusters, denoted $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$. Conditional on cluster membership, coordinates are independent and follow a univariate Laplace distribution with common scale parameter $b>0$. Specifically, for $j \\in \\{2,\\dots,d\\}$, the $j$-th coordinate has distribution $\\mathrm{Laplace}(0,b)$ in both clusters, while for the first coordinate the locations differ: $X_{1} \\mid X \\in \\mathcal{C}_{1} \\sim \\mathrm{Laplace}(-\\Delta/2,b)$ and $Y_{1} \\mid Y \\in \\mathcal{C}_{2} \\sim \\mathrm{Laplace}(+\\Delta/2,b)$ with $\\Delta>0$.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis is performed in the large-sample limit, where averages are replaced by expectations. By linearity of expectation and independence of coordinates, the expected $\\ell_1$ distance between two vectors $U$ and $V$ is the sum of the expected absolute differences of their coordinates: $E[\\|U-V\\|_1] = \\sum_{k=1}^d E[|U_k - V_k|]$.\n\n**1. Calculation of $a_{\\ell_1}$ (Expected Intra-cluster Distance)**\n\nLet $X$ and $X'$ be two independent points drawn from the same cluster, say $\\mathcal{C}_1$.\n$$a_{\\ell_1} = E[\\|X-X'\\|_1] = \\sum_{k=1}^d E[|X_k - X'_k|]$$\nThe location parameter of a Laplace distribution does not affect the expected absolute difference of two i.i.d. samples. That is, if $Z_1, Z_2 \\sim \\text{i.i.d. Laplace}(\\mu, b)$, then $E[|Z_1-Z_2|] = E[|(Z_1-\\mu)-(Z_2-\\mu)|] = E[|U_1-U_2|]$ where $U_1, U_2 \\sim \\text{i.i.d. Laplace}(0, b)$.\nThus, for every coordinate $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, d\\}$, the distribution of $X_k$ and $X'_k$ are i.i.d. Laplace with scale $b$, so $E[|X_k-X'_k|]$ is the same for all $k$.\n\nLet $U, U' \\sim \\text{i.i.d. Laplace}(0, b)$. The difference $W = U-U'$ has a known probability density function, obtained from the convolution of the distributions of $U$ and $-U'$. The density of $W$ is $f_W(w) = \\frac{1}{4b}(1 + |w|/b)e^{-|w|/b}$. We compute the expected absolute difference $E[|W|]$:\n$$ E[|U-U'|] = E[|W|] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |w| f_W(w) dw = 2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} w \\frac{1}{4b}\\left(1 + \\frac{w}{b}\\right)e^{-w/b} dw $$\n$$ = \\frac{1}{2b} \\left( \\int_{0}^{\\infty} w e^{-w/b} dw + \\frac{1}{b} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} w^2 e^{-w/b} dw \\right) $$\nUsing the standard integral identity for the Gamma function, $\\int_0^\\infty x^n e^{-x/a} dx = n! a^{n+1}$:\n- $\\int_0^\\infty w e^{-w/b} dw = 1! b^{1+1} = b^2$\n- $\\int_0^\\infty w^2 e^{-w/b} dw = 2! b^{2+1} = 2b^3$\nSubstituting these results:\n$$ E[|U-U'|] = \\frac{1}{2b} \\left( b^2 + \\frac{1}{b}(2b^3) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2b} (b^2 + 2b^2) = \\frac{3b^2}{2b} = \\frac{3b}{2} $$\nSince this holds for each coordinate, the total expected intra-cluster distance is:\n$$ a_{\\ell_1} = \\sum_{k=1}^d \\frac{3b}{2} = \\frac{3db}{2} $$\n\n**2. Calculation of $b_{\\ell_1}$ (Expected Inter-cluster Distance)**\n\nLet $X$ be a point from $\\mathcal{C}_1$ and $Y$ be a point from $\\mathcal{C}_2$.\n$$ b_{\\ell_1} = E[\\|X-Y\\|_1] = \\sum_{k=1}^d E[|X_k - Y_k|] $$\nFor coordinates $k \\in \\{2, \\dots, d\\}$, $X_k$ and $Y_k$ are i.i.d. $\\mathrm{Laplace}(0,b)$. Thus, for these $d-1$ coordinates:\n$$ E[|X_k - Y_k|] = \\frac{3b}{2} \\quad \\text{for } k=2, \\dots, d $$\nFor the first coordinate, $k=1$, $X_1 \\sim \\mathrm{Laplace}(-\\Delta/2, b)$ and $Y_1 \\sim \\mathrm{Laplace}(\\Delta/2, b)$. Let $U_1 = X_1 + \\Delta/2$ and $V_1 = Y_1 - \\Delta/2$. Then $U_1, V_1 \\sim \\text{i.i.d. Laplace}(0,b)$. The difference $X_1 - Y_1$ can be written as:\n$$ X_1 - Y_1 = (U_1 - \\Delta/2) - (V_1 + \\Delta/2) = (U_1 - V_1) - \\Delta $$\nLet $W = U_1 - V_1$. We need to compute $E[|W-\\Delta|]$. The density of $W$ is $f_W(w)$ as derived before.\n$$ E[|X_1 - Y_1|] = E[|W-\\Delta|] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |w-\\Delta| f_W(w) dw $$\nFor a symmetric random variable $W$, we can use the identity $E[|W-c|] = E[|W|] + 2\\int_0^c (F_W(t)-1/2) dt$. We have $E[|W|] = 3b/2$. We need the CDF of $W$, $F_W(t)$. For $t>0$:\n$$ F_W(t) - \\frac{1}{2} = \\int_0^t f_W(w) dw = \\int_0^t \\frac{1}{4b}\\left(1+\\frac{w}{b}\\right)e^{-w/b} dw $$\n$$ = \\frac{1}{4b} \\left[ -be^{-w/b} \\right]_0^t + \\frac{1}{4b^2} \\left[ -bwe^{-w/b} - b^2e^{-w/b} \\right]_0^t $$\n$$ = \\frac{1}{4}(1-e^{-t/b}) + \\frac{1}{4b^2} (-bte^{-t/b}-b^2e^{-t/b} + b^2) = \\frac{1}{4}(1-e^{-t/b}) + \\frac{1}{4}(1 - (1+t/b)e^{-t/b}) $$\n$$ F_W(t) - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}e^{-t/b} - \\frac{t}{4b}e^{-t/b} $$\nNow we integrate this from $0$ to $\\Delta$:\n$$ 2\\int_0^\\Delta \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}e^{-t/b} - \\frac{t}{4b}e^{-t/b}\\right) dt = \\left[ t + be^{-t/b} - \\frac{1}{2b}\\left(-bte^{-t/b}-b^2e^{-t/b}\\right) \\right]_0^\\Delta $$\n$$ = \\left[ t + be^{-t/b} + \\frac{t}{2}e^{-t/b} + \\frac{b}{2}e^{-t/b} \\right]_0^\\Delta = \\left[ t + \\left(\\frac{3b}{2}+\\frac{t}{2}\\right)e^{-t/b} \\right]_0^\\Delta $$\n$$ = \\left( \\Delta + \\left(\\frac{3b}{2}+\\frac{\\Delta}{2}\\right)e^{-\\Delta/b} \\right) - \\left( 0 + \\frac{3b}{2} \\right) = \\Delta - \\frac{3b}{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2}+\\frac{3b}{2}\\right)e^{-\\Delta/b} $$\nFinally, we add this to $E[|W|]$:\n$$ E[|X_1 - Y_1|] = E[|W-\\Delta|] = \\frac{3b}{2} + \\Delta - \\frac{3b}{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2}+\\frac{3b}{2}\\right)e^{-\\Delta/b} = \\Delta + \\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2}+\\frac{3b}{2}\\right)e^{-\\Delta/b} $$\nThe total expected inter-cluster distance is:\n$$ b_{\\ell_1} = E[|X_1 - Y_1|] + \\sum_{k=2}^d E[|X_k - Y_k|] = \\left( \\Delta + \\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2}+\\frac{3b}{2}\\right)e^{-\\Delta/b} \\right) + (d-1)\\frac{3b}{2} $$\n\n**3. Calculation of the Average Silhouette $\\bar{s}_{\\ell_1}$**\n\nBy the law of large numbers and symmetry, the average silhouette $\\bar{s}_{\\ell_1}$ converges to the silhouette of any representative point. Using the given assumption that $b_{\\ell_1} \\ge a_{\\ell_1}$:\n$$ \\bar{s}_{\\ell_1} = \\frac{b_{\\ell_1} - a_{\\ell_1}}{b_{\\ell_1}} $$\nThe difference is:\n$$ b_{\\ell_1} - a_{\\ell_1} = E[|X_1 - Y_1|] - E[|X_1 - X'_1|] = \\left( \\Delta + \\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2}+\\frac{3b}{2}\\right)e^{-\\Delta/b} \\right) - \\frac{3b}{2} $$\nThe expression for the average silhouette is the ratio of this difference to $b_{\\ell_1}$:\n$$ \\bar{s}_{\\ell_1} = \\frac{\\Delta + (\\frac{\\Delta}{2}+\\frac{3b}{2})e^{-\\Delta/b} - \\frac{3b}{2}}{\\Delta + (\\frac{\\Delta}{2}+\\frac{3b}{2})e^{-\\Delta/b} + (d-1)\\frac{3b}{2}} $$\nTo simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by $2$:\n$$ \\bar{s}_{\\ell_1} = \\frac{2\\Delta + (\\Delta+3b)e^{-\\Delta/b} - 3b}{2\\Delta + (\\Delta+3b)e^{-\\Delta/b} + 3b(d-1)} $$\nDivide numerator and denominator by $b$:\n$$ \\bar{s}_{\\ell_1} = \\frac{2(\\Delta/b) + (\\Delta/b+3)e^{-\\Delta/b} - 3}{2(\\Delta/b) + (\\Delta/b+3)e^{-\\Delta/b} + 3(d-1)} = \\frac{2\\frac{\\Delta}{b} + (\\frac{\\Delta}{b}+3)e^{-\\frac{\\Delta}{b}} - 3}{2\\frac{\\Delta}{b} + (\\frac{\\Delta}{b}+3)e^{-\\frac{\\Delta}{b}} + 3d - 3} $$\nThis expression represents the final simplified form.\n\n**4. Conceptual Comparison of $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ Norms**\n\nReplacing the $\\ell_1$ norm with the $\\ell_2$ norm would qualitatively change the behavior of the silhouette due to the difference in how the norms treat large deviations, which are characteristic of the Laplace distribution's heavy tails.\n\n- **Sensitivity to Tails**: The $\\ell_2$ norm involves squaring differences, whereas the $\\ell_1$ norm takes absolute values. This makes the $\\ell_2$ norm far more sensitive to large deviations (outliers). The Laplace distribution has heavier tails than a Gaussian distribution, meaning large deviations $|X_k-Y_k|$ are more probable. Squaring these large values in the $\\ell_2$ calculation inflates the expected distances, both within ($a_{\\ell_2}$) and between ($b_{\\ell_2}$) clusters.\n\n- **Impact on Signal-to-Noise**: The silhouette coefficient is fundamentally a measure of signal (between-cluster separation) versus noise (within-cluster spread). The separation signal is provided only by the first coordinate, where the means differ by $\\Delta$. The remaining $d-1$ coordinates contribute only to the \"noise\" or spread terms that obscure this separation.\n\n- **Relative Inflation of Noise**: For a Laplace distribution with scale $b$, the variance (relevant for $\\ell_2^2$ distance) is $2b^2$, while the mean absolute deviation from the median (relevant for $\\ell_1$ distance) is $b$. The variance is disproportionately large compared to the mean absolute deviation due to the influence of the tails. Consequently, when summing up the contributions from the $d-1$ non-separating dimensions, the \"noise\" term in the denominator of the silhouette formula grows faster for the $\\ell_2$ norm than for the $\\ell_1$ norm. This larger denominator for the $\\ell_2$ case would lead to a smaller silhouette value, suggesting poorer cluster separation.\n\nIn essence, the $\\ell_1$ norm is more robust to the heavy tails of the Laplace distribution. It provides a clearer signal of the mean-shift separation along the first coordinate, whereas the $\\ell_2$ norm is more influenced by the large variance in all dimensions, which tends to wash out the separation signal, especially as dimensionality $d$ increases.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2\\frac{\\Delta}{b} + \\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{b}+3\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta}{b}\\right) - 3}{2\\frac{\\Delta}{b} + \\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{b}+3\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta}{b}\\right) + 3d - 3}}$$", "id": "3109082"}, {"introduction": "In practice, selecting the optimal number of clusters, $k$, is a balancing act, not a simple maximization problem. This exercise presents a realistic scenario where you must interpret and synthesize results from both silhouette analysis and the Gap statistic to make a well-reasoned decision. You will see how naively maximizing a metric can lead to overfittingâ€”creating many tiny, meaningless clustersâ€”and learn to apply a penalized criterion that formally balances cluster quality against model complexity, leading to a more robust and meaningful result.", "problem": "A data set with $n=120$ observations is clustered by $k$-means for several values of the number of clusters $k \\in \\{3,4,6,8\\}$.

The penalty strength is given as $\\lambda=0.5$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the unpenalized Gap statistic, $\\mathrm{Gap}(k)$, for each $k$:\n- For $k=3$: $\\mathrm{Gap}(3) = \\mathbb{E}^*[\\log W_3] - \\log W_3 = 9.60 - 8.70 = 0.90$.\n- For $k=4$: $\\mathrm{Gap}(4) = \\mathbb{E}^*[\\log W_4] - \\log W_4 = 9.50 - 8.30 = 1.20$.\n- For $k=6$: $\\mathrm{Gap}(6) = \\mathbb{E}^*[\\log W_6] - \\log W_6 = 9.40 - 7.90 = 1.50$.\n- For $k=8$: $\\mathrm{Gap}(8) = \\mathbb{E}^*[\\log W_8] - \\log W_8 = 9.35 - 7.70 = 1.65$.\n\nNext, we calculate the fragmentation penalty term, $\\phi(k)$, for each $k$:\n- For $k=3$: $\\phi(3) = \\sum_{c=1}^{3} \\frac{1}{n_c} = \\frac{1}{42} + \\frac{1}{40} + \\frac{1}{38} \\approx 0.02381 + 0.02500 + 0.02632 = 0.07513$.\n- For $k=4$: $\\phi(4) = \\sum_{c=1}^{4} \\frac{1}{n_c} = \\frac{1}{34} + \\frac{1}{30} + \\frac{1}{28} + \\frac{1}{28} \\approx 0.02941 + 0.03333 + 2 \\times 0.03571 = 0.13416$.\n- For $k=6$: $\\phi(6) = \\sum_{c=1}^{6} \\frac{1}{n_c} = \\frac{1}{34} + \\frac{1}{30} + \\frac{1}{20} + \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{1}{8} \\approx 0.02941 + 0.03333 + 0.05000 + 0.06250 + 0.08333 + 0.12500 = 0.38357$.\n- For $k=8$: $\\phi(8) = \\sum_{c=1}^{8} \\frac{1}{n_c} = \\frac{1}{30} + \\frac{1}{28} + \\frac{1}{20} + \\frac{1}{18} + \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} \\approx 0.03333 + 0.03571 + 0.05000 + 0.05556 + 0.08333 + 0.16667 + 0.25000 + 0.50000 = 1.1746$.\n\nFinally, we compute the penalized Gap statistic, $\\mathrm{Gap}_\\lambda(k) = \\mathrm{Gap}(k) - \\lambda\\,\\phi(k)$, with $\\lambda=0.5$:\n- For $k=3$: $\\mathrm{Gap}_{0.5}(3) = 0.90 - 0.5 \\times 0.07513 \\approx 0.90 - 0.03757 = 0.86243$.\n- For $k=4$: $\\mathrm{Gap}_{0.5}(4) = 1.20 - 0.5 \\times 0.13416 \\approx 1.20 - 0.06708 = 1.13292$.\n- For $k=6$: $\\mathrm{Gap}_{0.5}(6) = 1.50 - 0.5 \\times 0.38357 \\approx 1.50 - 0.19179 = 1.30821$.\n- For $k=8$: $\\mathrm{Gap}_{0.5}(8) = 1.65 - 0.5 \\times 1.1746 \\approx 1.65 - 0.58730 = 1.06270$.\n\nComparing the values of $\\mathrm{Gap}_{0.5}(k)$:\n- $\\mathrm{Gap}_{0.5}(3) \\approx 0.86$\n- $\\mathrm{Gap}_{0.5}(4) \\approx 1.13$\n- $\\mathrm{Gap}_{0.5}(6) \\approx 1.31$ (Maximum)\n- $\\mathrm{Gap}_{0.5}(8) \\approx 1.06$\n\nThe penalized criterion $\\mathrm{Gap}_{0.5}(k)$ is maximized at $k=6$.\n\nThe supporting metrics provide context. For $k=8$, both the average silhouette $\\bar{s}=0.78$ and the unpenalized $\\mathrm{Gap}(8)=1.65$ are maximal. However, the cluster sizes $(30, 28, 20, 18, 12, 6, 4, 2)$ show severe fragmentation, with multiple very small clusters. This is a classic sign of overfitting, where the high $\\bar{s}$ value is artificially inflated by isolating outliers. The penalty term $\\phi(8)$ is very large, correctly identifying this pathology. The penalized score $\\mathrm{Gap}_{0.5}(8)$ is consequently reduced below the score for $k=6$.\n\nFor $k=6$, the cluster sizes are $(34, 30, 20, 16, 12, 8)$. While not perfectly balanced, there are no extremely small clusters as seen for $k=8$. The solution has a high average silhouette ($\\bar{s}=0.70$) and achieves the best balance between explaining within-cluster dispersion (the $\\mathrm{Gap}(k)$ term) and avoiding fragmentation (the $\\phi(k)$ term), as captured by the maximum value of $\\mathrm{Gap}_{0.5}(6)$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Select $k=8$ because it maximizes both $\\bar{s}$ and the unpenalized $\\mathrm{Gap}(k)$; the penalty is unnecessary if $\\bar{s}$ is large.**\nThis statement is flawed. While $k=8$ does maximize $\\bar{s}$ and $\\mathrm{Gap}(k)$, the argument that the penalty is unnecessary is incorrect. The problem statement explicitly provides the penalty to address the known issue that these metrics can be inflated by overfitting, which is strongly suggested by the presence of tiny clusters (sizes $2$, $4$, $6$). The penalized criterion must be used as directed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**B. Select $k=6$ because it maximizes $\\mathrm{Gap}_\\lambda(k)$; its $\\bar{s}$ is high without relying on multiple tiny clusters, indicating good separation without overfitting.**\nOur calculations show that $k=6$ indeed maximizes the specified criterion, $\\mathrm{Gap}_{0.5}(k) \\approx 1.31$. The reasoning provided is also correct: it achieves a high average silhouette ($\\bar{s}=0.70$) and good cluster separation (high $\\mathrm{Gap}(6)$ value) without the pathological fragmentation seen at $k=8$. This represents the best trade-off according to the problem's own methodology.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. Select $k=4$ by the one-standard-error rule for the Gap statistic, since it is the smallest $k$ within one standard error of the maximum.**\nThis option invokes the \"one-standard-error rule\", a heuristic for the Gap statistic. However, the problem does not provide the standard errors ($SE_k$) of the $\\mathbb{E}^*[\\log W_k]$ estimates, which are required to apply this rule. Therefore, this choice is based on information not available in the problem statement and ignores the explicitly defined penalized criterion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Select $k=3$ because it minimizes $\\phi(k)$, fully avoiding tiny clusters even if separation worsens.**\nThis statement correctly notes that $k=3$ minimizes the penalty term $\\phi(k)$ due to its balanced cluster sizes. However, the goal is not to minimize the penalty alone, but to maximize the penalized Gap statistic, $\\mathrm{Gap}_\\lambda(k)$, which balances the penalty against the measure of cluster separation. Choosing $k=3$ is overly conservative and leads to a suboptimal $\\mathrm{Gap}_{0.5}(3)$ value of approximately $0.86$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "3109161"}, {"introduction": "The Gap statistic relies on Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the behavior of a dataset with no inherent clustering.

We will first validate the unbiasedness of the standard estimator and then derive the leading-order bias for the alternative estimator, concluding with proposed corrections.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in statistical learning theory, specifically Monte Carlo estimation and bias-variance analysis. The definitions and objectives are clear, well-posed, and mathematically formalizable. All necessary assumptions, such as the existence and properties of the moments $\\mu_k$ and $\\sigma_k^{2}$, are provided. Thus, the problem is valid.\n\nFirst, we analyze the estimator $\\widehat{\\mathrm{Gap}}_{\\ln}(k) = \\widehat{m}_{\\ln}(k) - \\ln(W_k)$. The term $\\ln(W_k)$ is a constant with respect to the expectation under the null reference model, $\\mathbb{E}^{*}[\\cdot]$, as $W_k$ is computed from the fixed observed data. The bias of the estimator is therefore entirely determined by the bias of $\\widehat{m}_{\\ln}(k) = \\frac{1}{B}\\sum_{b=1}^{B} \\ln(W_{k}^{*(b)})$ as an estimator for the target quantity $\\mathbb{E}^{*}[\\ln(W_k^{*})]$.\n\nLet us compute the expectation of $\\widehat{m}_{\\ln}(k)$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}^{*}\\left[\\widehat{m}_{\\ln}(k)\\right] = \\mathbb{E}^{*}\\left[\\frac{1}{B}\\sum_{b=1}^{B} \\ln\\left(W_{k}^{*(b)}\\right)\\right]\n$$\nBy linearity of expectation, we can move the expectation operator inside the sum:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}^{*}\\left[\\widehat{m}_{\\ln}(k)\\right] = \\frac{1}{B}\\sum_{b=1}^{B} \\mathbb{E}^{*}\\left[\\ln\\left(W_{k}^{*(b)}\\right)\\right]\n$$\nSince the Monte Carlo replicates $\\{W_{k}^{*(b)}\\}_{b=1}^{B}$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), the expectation $\\mathbb{E}^{*}[\\ln(W_k^{*(b)})]$ is the same for all $b$, and is equal to the target parameter $\\mathbb{E}^{*}[\\ln(W_k^{*})]$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}^{*}\\left[\\widehat{m}_{\\ln}(k)\\right] = \\frac{1}{B}\\sum_{b=1}^{B} \\mathbb{E}^{*}\\left[\\ln(W_k^{*})\\right] = \\frac{1}{B} \\cdot B \\cdot \\mathbb{E}^{*}\\left[\\ln(W_k^{*})\\right] = \\mathbb{E}^{*}\\left[\\ln(W_k^{*})\\right]\n$$\nThis demonstrates that $\\widehat{m}_{\\ln}(k)$ is an exactly unbiased estimator for $\\mathbb{E}^{*}[\\ln(W_k^{*})]$. Consequently, $\\widehat{\\mathrm{Gap}}_{\\ln}(k)$ is an exactly unbiased estimator for the target quantity $\\mathbb{E}^{*}[\\ln(W_k^{*})] - \\ln(W_k)$ for any finite $B \\ge 1$. The problem's phrasing of \"approximately unbiased for large $B$\" is thus a slight imprecision; the estimator is, in fact, exactly unbiased.\n\nNext, we analyze the alternative estimator $\\widehat{m}_{\\mathrm{alt}}(k) = \\ln\\Big(\\frac{1}{B}\\sum_{b=1}^{B} W_{k}^{*(b)}\\Big)$. Let $\\bar{W}_k^{*} = \\frac{1}{B}\\sum_{b=1}^{B} W_{k}^{*(b)}$. The estimator is $\\widehat{m}_{\\mathrm{alt}}(k) = \\ln(\\bar{W}_k^{*})$.

To analyze $\\mathbb{E}^{*}[\\ln(\\bar{W}_k^{*})]$, we use a second-order Taylor series expansion of the function $f(x) = \\ln(x)$ around the point $\\mu_k = \\mathbb{E}^{*}[\\bar{W}_k^{*}]$.\nThe derivatives of $f(x)$ are $f'(x) = 1/x$ and $f''(x) = -1/x^2$. The Taylor expansion is:\n$$\nf(x) \\approx f(\\mu_k) + f'(\\mu_k)(x - \\mu_k) + \\frac{1}{2}f''(\\mu_k)(x - \\mu_k)^2\n$$\nSubstituting $x = \\bar{W}_k^{*}$ and the expressions for the function and its derivatives:\n$$\n\\ln(\\bar{W}_k^{*}) \\approx \\ln(\\mu_k) + \\frac{1}{\\mu_k}(\\bar{W}_k^{*} - \\mu_k) - \\frac{1}{2\\mu_k^2}(\\bar{W}_k^{*} - \\mu_k)^2\n$$\nNow, we take the expectation of both sides under the null model:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}^{*}[\\ln(\\bar{W}_k^{*})] \\approx \\mathbb{E}^{*}\\left[ \\ln(\\mu_k) + \\frac{1}{\\mu_k}(\\bar{W}_k^{*} - \\mu_k) - \\frac{1}{2\\mu_k^2}(\\bar{W}_k^{*} - \\mu_k)^2 \\right]\n$$\nUsing the linearity of expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}^{*}[\\ln(\\bar{W}_k^{*})] \\approx \\ln(\\mu_k) + \\frac{1}{\\mu_k}\\mathbb{E}^{*}[(\\bar{W}_k^{*} - \\mu_k)] - \\frac{1}{2\\mu_k^2}\\mathbb{E}^{*}[(\\bar{W}_k^{*} - \\mu_k)^2]\n$$\nThe terms in the expectation are:\n1. $\\mathbb{E}^{*}[(\\bar{W}_k^{*} - \\mu_k)] = \\mathbb{E}^{*}[\\bar{W}_k^{*}] - \\mu_k = \\mu_k - \\mu_k = 0$.\n2. $\\mathbb{E}^{*}[(\\bar{W}_k^{*} - \\mu_k)^2] = \\mathrm{Var}^{*}(\\bar{W}_k^{*})$.\n\nThe variance of the sample mean $\\bar{W}_k^{*}$ of $B$ i.i.d. random variables $W_k^{*(b)}$ (each with variance $\\sigma_k^2$) is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}^{*}(\\bar{W}_k^{*}) = \\mathrm{Var}^{*}\\left(\\frac{1}{B}\\sum_{b=1}^{B} W_{k}^{*(b)}\\right) = \\frac{1}{B^2}\\sum_{b=1}^{B} \\mathrm{Var}^{*}(W_{k}^{*(b)}) = \\frac{1}{B^2}(B \\sigma_k^2) = \\frac{\\sigma_k^2}{B}\n$$\nSubstituting these results back into the expansion for the expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}^{*}[\\ln(\\bar{W}_k^{*})] \\approx \\ln(\\mu_k) + \\frac{1}{\\mu_k}(0) - \\frac{1}{2\\mu_k^2}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_k^2}{B}\\right) = \\ln(\\mu_k) - \\frac{\\sigma_k^2}{2B\\mu_k^2}\n$$\nThe bias is the difference between this expected value and the target value $\\ln(\\mu_k)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Bias}[\\widehat{m}_{\\mathrm{alt}}(k)] = \\mathbb{E}^{*}[\\ln(\\bar{W}_k^{*})] - \\ln(\\mu_k) \\approx -\\frac{\\sigma_k^2}{2B\\mu_k^2}\n$$\nThis expression represents the leading-order bias, which is of order $O(1/B)$. This negative bias is consistent with Jensen's inequality for the concave function $\\ln(\\cdot)$, which states that $\\mathbb{E}[\\ln(X)] \\le \\ln(\\mathbb{E}[X])$.\n\nTo propose practical corrections, we can construct a bias-corrected estimator by subtracting an estimate of this bias from the original estimator. The bias is $-\\frac{\\sigma_k^2}{2B\\mu_k^2}$, so we should add an estimate of $\\frac{\\sigma_k^2}{2B\\mu_k^2}$. We can estimate the unknown moments $\\mu_k$ and $\\sigma_k^2$ from the Monte Carlo samples $\\{W_{k}^{*(b)}\\}_{b=1}^{B}$.

An alternative, more general but computationally intensive, method is to use a resampling technique like the jackknife to estimate and correct for the bias without relying on the analytical derivation.\n\nThe question asks for the single closed-form expression for the leading-order bias of $\\widehat{m}_{\\mathrm{alt}}(k)$.
