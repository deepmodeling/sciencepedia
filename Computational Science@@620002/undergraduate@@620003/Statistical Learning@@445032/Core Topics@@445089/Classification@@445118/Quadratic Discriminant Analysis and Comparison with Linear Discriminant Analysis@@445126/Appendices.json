A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n**Part 1: QDA Posterior and Log-Odds**\nThe posterior probability of class $Y=1$ given an observation $X=x$ is given by Bayes' rule:\n$$p(Y=1 \\mid X=x) = \\frac{p(X=x \\mid Y=1) p(Y=1)}{p(X=x \\mid Y=1) p(Y=1) + p(X=x \\mid Y=2) p(Y=2)}$$\nLet $\\pi_k = p(Y=k)$ be the prior probability for class $k$, and let $f_k(x) = p(X=x \\mid Y=k)$ be the class-conditional probability density. For a Gaussian distribution, this is:\n$$f_k(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma_k^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-\\mu_k)^2}{2\\sigma_k^2}\\right)$$\nThe posterior for class $1$ is:\n$$p(Y=1 \\mid X=x) = \\frac{\\pi_1 f_1(x)}{\\pi_1 f_1(x) + \\pi_2 f_2(x)}$$\nThe log-odds, or logit, is the natural logarithm of the ratio of the posterior probabilities:\n$$\\text{log-odds} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p(Y=1 \\mid X=x)}{p(Y=2 \\mid X=x)}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\frac{\\pi_1 f_1(x)}{\\pi_1 f_1(x) + \\pi_2 f_2(x)}}{\\frac{\\pi_2 f_2(x)}{\\pi_1 f_1(x) + \\pi_2 f_2(x)}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi_1 f_1(x)}{\\pi_2 f_2(x)}\\right)$$\nThis can be expanded as:\n$$\\text{log-odds} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi_1}{\\pi_2}\\right) + \\ln(f_1(x)) - \\ln(f_2(x))$$\nSubstituting the expression for the Gaussian log-density, where $\\ln(f_k(x)) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2\\pi\\sigma_k^2) - \\frac{(x-\\mu_k)^2}{2\\sigma_k^2}$:\n$$\\text{log-odds} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi_1}{\\pi_2}\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2\\pi\\sigma_1^2) - \\frac{(x-\\mu_1)^2}{2\\sigma_1^2} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2\\pi\\sigma_2^2) - \\frac{(x-\\mu_2)^2}{2\\sigma_2^2}\\right)$$\n$$\\text{log-odds} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi_1}{\\pi_2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{\\sigma_1^2}\\right) - \\frac{(x-\\mu_1)^2}{2\\sigma_1^2} + \\frac{(x-\\mu_2)^2}{2\\sigma_2^2}$$\nTo show this is a quadratic function of $x$, we expand the terms involving $x$:\n$$- \\frac{x^2 - 2x\\mu_1 + \\mu_1^2}{2\\sigma_1^2} + \\frac{x^2 - 2x\\mu_2 + \\mu_2^2}{2\\sigma_2^2}$$\nGrouping by powers of $x$, we have:\n$$x^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\sigma_2^2} - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_1^2}\\right) + x \\left(\\frac{\\mu_1}{\\sigma_1^2} - \\frac{\\mu_2}{\\sigma_2^2}\\right) + C$$\nwhere $C$ contains all constant terms. Since the variances are unequal ($\\sigma_1^2 \\neq \\sigma_2^2$), the coefficient of the $x^2$ term, $\\frac{1}{2\\sigma_2^2} - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_1^2}$, is non-zero. Therefore, the log-odds is a quadratic function of $x$.\n\n**Part 2: QDA Decision Thresholds**\nThe decision thresholds are the values of $x$ where the posterior probabilities are equal, which is equivalent to the log-odds being zero.\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi_1}{\\pi_2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{\\sigma_1^2}\\right) - \\frac{(x-\\mu_1)^2}{2\\sigma_1^2} + \\frac{(x-\\mu_2)^2}{2\\sigma_2^2} = 0$$\nWe substitute the given parameters: $\\pi_{1} = 0.7$, $\\pi_{2} = 0.3$, $\\mu_{1} = 0$, $\\sigma_{1}^{2} = 1$, $\\mu_{2} = 3$, $\\sigma_{2}^{2} = 4$.\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{0.7}{0.3}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{4}{1}\\right) - \\frac{(x-0)^2}{2(1)} + \\frac{(x-3)^2}{2(4)} = 0$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{7}{3}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(4) - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^2 - 6x + 9}{8} = 0$$\nSince $\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(4) = \\ln(\\sqrt{4}) = \\ln(2)$, the equation becomes:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{7}{3}\\right) + \\ln(2) - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^2 - 6x + 9}{8} = 0$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right) - \\frac{4x^2}{8} + \\frac{x^2 - 6x + 9}{8} = 0$$\nMultiply by $8$:\n$$8\\ln\\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right) - 4x^2 + x^2 - 6x + 9 = 0$$\n$$-3x^2 - 6x + \\left(9 + 8\\ln\\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right)\\right) = 0$$\n$$3x^2 + 6x - \\left(9 + 8\\ln\\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right)\\right) = 0$$\nWe solve this quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ with $a=3$, $b=6$, and $c = -\\left(9 + 8\\ln\\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right)\\right)$ using the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$x = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{6^2 - 4(3)\\left(-\\left(9 + 8\\ln\\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right)\\right)\\right)}}{2(3)}$$\n$$x = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 + 12\\left(9 + 8\\ln\\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right)\\right)}}{6}$$\n$$x = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 + 108 + 96\\ln\\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right)}}{6}$$\n$$x = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{144 + 96\\ln\\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right)}}{6}$$\nWe can factor out $16$ from the term under the square root:\n$$x = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{16\\left(9 + 6\\ln\\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right)\\right)}}{6} = \\frac{-6 \\pm 4\\sqrt{9 + 6\\ln\\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right)}}{6}$$\n$$x = -1 \\pm \\frac{2}{3}\\sqrt{9 + 6\\ln\\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right)}$$\nThe two thresholds, ordered from smaller to larger, are:\n$$x_1 = -1 - \\frac{2}{3}\\sqrt{9 + 6\\ln\\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right)}$$\n$$x_2 = -1 + \\frac{2}{3}\\sqrt{9 + 6\\ln\\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right)}$$\n\n**Part 3: Asymmetric Decision Regions**\nThe decision regions are asymmetric for two main reasons in this QDA setting:\n1.  **Unequal Variances ($\\sigma_1^2 \\neq \\sigma_2^2$):** This is the fundamental reason for a quadratic boundary. The log-ratio of the Gaussian densities includes an $x^2$ term, resulting in the log-odds being a parabola. A quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ generally has two distinct roots ($x_1, x_2$). In this problem, the coefficient of $x^2$ in the log-odds is negative ($\\frac{1}{2\\sigma_2^2} - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_1^2} = \\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{3}{8}  0$), so the parabola opens downwards. This means class $1$ is predicted for $x \\in [x_1, x_2]$, a finite interval. Class $2$ is predicted for $x \\in (-\\infty, x_1) \\cup (x_2, \\infty)$, a disconnected region composed of two infinite intervals. This inherent difference in the geometric nature of the decision regions (one is a single finite segment, the other is not) constitutes a form of asymmetry.\n2.  **Unequal Priors ($\\pi_1 \\neq \\pi_2$):** The priors influence the constant term of the log-odds through the term $\\ln(\\pi_1 / \\pi_2)$. If the priors are unequal, this term is non-zero, causing a vertical shift of the log-odds parabola. This shift moves the decision boundaries $x_1$ and $x_2$, altering the size of the decision regions. For example, since $\\pi_1=0.7 > \\pi_2=0.3$, the log-prior term is positive, shifting the parabola upwards and thus widening the interval $[x_1, x_2]$ where class $1$ is favored compared to a scenario with equal priors.\n\n**Part 4: LDA Threshold**\nLinear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) assumes a common variance, $\\sigma_1^2 = \\sigma_2^2 = \\sigma^2$. For this part, we are also told to assume equal priors, $\\pi_1 = \\pi_2$.\nThe log-odds equation simplifies significantly. The term $\\ln(\\pi_1/\\pi_2) = \\ln(1) = 0$. The terms involving variance in the log-density ratio also cancel: $\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(\\sigma_2^2/\\sigma_1^2) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(1) = 0$. The log-odds equation becomes:\n$$\\text{log-odds} = - \\frac{(x-\\mu_1)^2}{2\\sigma^2} + \\frac{(x-\\mu_2)^2}{2\\sigma^2} = 0$$\nMultiplying by $2\\sigma^2$ (assuming $\\sigma^2 > 0$):\n$$-(x-\\mu_1)^2 + (x-\\mu_2)^2 = 0$$\n$$(x-\\mu_2)^2 = (x-\\mu_1)^2$$\nThis is a linear equation in $x$:\n$$x^2 - 2x\\mu_2 + \\mu_2^2 = x^2 - 2x\\mu_1 + \\mu_1^2$$\n$$-2x\\mu_2 + \\mu_2^2 = -2x\\mu_1 + \\mu_1^2$$\n$$2x\\mu_1 - 2x\\mu_2 = \\mu_1^2 - \\mu_2^2$$\n$$2x(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2) = (\\mu_1 - \\mu_2)(\\mu_1 + \\mu_2)$$\nAssuming $\\mu_1 \\neq \\mu_2$, we divide by $2(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2)$:\n$$x = \\frac{\\mu_1 + \\mu_2}{2}$$\nThe common variance $\\sigma^2$ indeed cancels. The threshold is simply the midpoint of the two means.

For $\\Sigma(\\rho) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  \\rho \\\\ \\rho  1 \\end{pmatrix}$ with $|\\rho|1$, the inverse is\n$\\Sigma(\\rho)^{-1} = \\dfrac{1}{1 - \\rho^2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -\\rho \\\\ -\\rho  1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThus\n$\\Sigma_1^{-1} = \\dfrac{1}{1 - \\rho^2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -\\rho \\\\ -\\rho  1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\Sigma_2^{-1} = \\dfrac{1}{1 - \\rho^2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  \\rho \\\\ \\rho  1 \\end{pmatrix}$,\nand hence\n$\\Sigma_2^{-1} - \\Sigma_1^{-1} = \\dfrac{1}{1 - \\rho^2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  2\\rho \\\\ 2\\rho  0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\dfrac{2\\rho}{1 - \\rho^2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nTherefore, the decision criterion is based on the sign of $x^\\top (\\Sigma_2^{-1} - \\Sigma_1^{-1}) x = \\dfrac{4\\rho}{1 - \\rho^2} x_1 x_2$.\nThe Bayes rule with equal priors is to predict class 1 if $\\log p_1(x) > \\log p_2(x)$, which simplifies to $x^\\top (\\Sigma_2^{-1} - \\Sigma_1^{-1})x > 0$. Since $\\rho \\in (0,1)$, this is equivalent to $x_1 x_2 > 0$. So class 1 (positive correlation) is predicted for $x_1 x_2 > 0$ and class 2 (negative correlation) for $x_1 x_2  0$. The boundary is $x_1 x_2 = 0$, which corresponds to the axes.\n\nLDA under a common covariance. LDA assumes a common covariance $\\Sigma_p$, typically pooled across classes. With the two class covariances given, the pooled covariance is\n$\\Sigma_p = \\dfrac{1}{2}(\\Sigma_1 + \\Sigma_2) = \\dfrac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  \\rho \\\\ \\rho  1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\dfrac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -\\rho \\\\ -\\rho  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThus, the off-diagonal entries cancel to $0$. The LDA discriminant score for class $k$ has the form (up to an additive constant common to both classes) $\\delta_k(x) = x^\\top \\Sigma_p^{-1} \\mu_k - \\tfrac{1}{2} \\mu_k^\\top \\Sigma_p^{-1} \\mu_k + \\log \\pi_k$. With $\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = 0$ and equal priors, we obtain $\\delta_1(x) = \\delta_2(x)$ for all $x$. Hence, LDA produces a tie everywhere and cannot discriminate; under any tie-breaking that does not use $x$, the expected error is $50\\%$ given equal priors.\n\nError comparison and intuition. The Bayes/QDA classifier separates by the sign of $x_1 x_2$, which aligns with the dependence structure: for a zero-mean bivariate normal with correlation $\\rho > 0$, the probability that $x_1$ and $x_2$ have the same sign is strictly greater than $1/2$; for $\\rho  0$, it is strictly less than $1/2$. A well-known identity for zero-mean bivariate normal gives $\\mathbb{P}(x_1 x_2 > 0) = \\tfrac{1}{2} + \\tfrac{1}{\\pi} \\arcsin(\\rho)$, which is strictly larger than $\\tfrac{1}{2}$ for $\\rho > 0$ and strictly smaller than $\\tfrac{1}{2}$ for $\\rho  0$. Therefore, the Bayes/QDA rule that assigns classes according to the sign of $x_1 x_2$ achieves strictly less than $50\\%$ error, while LDA is stuck at $50\\%$ for this construction.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n- Option A: Our derivation shows the Bayes/QDA boundary is $x_1 x_2 = 0$ and that class 1 is assigned when $x_1 x_2 > 0$ and class 2 when $x_1 x_2  0$. This matches the statement in the option exactly. Verdict: Correct.\n- Option B: The pooled covariance is $\\Sigma_p = I_2$, which discards off-diagonal information. Therefore, LDA does not produce a nontrivial linear boundary such as $x_1 = x_2$; in fact, with equal means and priors, it produces a tie everywhere and no separation. Verdict: Incorrect.\n- Option C: With $\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = 0$, $\\Sigma_p = I_2$, and equal priors, $\\delta_1(x) = \\delta_2(x)$ for all $x$, so LDA ties everywhere and yields an expected error of $50\\%$. Verdict: Correct.\n- Option D: We computed $\\Sigma_p = \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\Sigma_1 + \\Sigma_2) = I_2$, whose off-diagonal entry is $0$. Hence LDA cannot use the correlation difference. Verdict: Correct.\n- Option E: As argued, the Bayes/QDA rule aligns with the sign structure induced by correlation and achieves strictly less than $50\\%$ error for any $\\rho \\in (0,1)$.
