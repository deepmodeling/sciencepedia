Over a series of observations, the analyst records the number of requests per second ($x$) and the corresponding CPU load ($y$) as a percentage. To model this relationship, the analyst proposes a simple linear regression model of the form $y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$.\n\nAfter collecting the data, the analyst computes the following summary statistics, which are essential for determining the least squares regression line:\n- The sum of squared deviations for the number of requests: $S_{xx} = \\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2 = 4.81 \\times 10^4 \\text{ (requests/s)}^2$\n- The sum of the products of deviations for requests and CPU load: $S_{xy} = \\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y}) = 2.15 \\times 10^3 \\text{ percent} \\cdot \\text{(requests/s)}$\n\nUsing these summary statistics, calculate the estimated slope ($\\hat{\\beta}_1$) of the regression line.

The residual, which is the difference between the observed value and the value predicted by the model, is the primary tool for this assessment.
