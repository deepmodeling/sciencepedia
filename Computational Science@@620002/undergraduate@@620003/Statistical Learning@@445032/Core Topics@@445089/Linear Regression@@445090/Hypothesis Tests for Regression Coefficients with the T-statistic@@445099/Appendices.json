The estimate $\\hat\\sigma^2$ is computed from the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS): $\\hat\\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\text{RSS}}{n-2}$.\nFor Model 1, the fitted values are $\\hat y_i = \\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1 x_i$. The OLS intercept is $\\hat\\beta_0 = \\bar y - \\hat\\beta_1 \\bar x$. Thus,\n$$ \\hat y_i = (\\bar y - \\hat\\beta_1 \\bar x) + \\hat\\beta_1 x_i = \\bar y + \\hat\\beta_1(x_i - \\bar x) $$\nFor Model 2, the fitted values are $\\hat y_i^{(z)} = \\hat{\\tilde\\beta}_0 + \\hat\\beta_1^{(z)} z_i$. The OLS intercept is $\\hat{\\tilde\\beta}_0 = \\bar y - \\hat\\beta_1^{(z)} \\bar z$. Since $\\bar z = 0$, we have $\\hat{\\tilde\\beta}_0 = \\bar y$. Thus,\n$$ \\hat y_i^{(z)} = \\bar y + \\hat\\beta_1^{(z)} z_i $$\nNow, substitute the relationships $\\hat\\beta_1^{(z)} = s_x \\hat\\beta_1$ and $z_i = \\frac{x_i - \\bar x}{s_x}$:\n$$ \\hat y_i^{(z)} = \\bar y + (s_x \\hat\\beta_1) \\left( \\frac{x_i - \\bar x}{s_x} \\right) = \\bar y + \\hat\\beta_1(x_i - \\bar x) $$\nWe see that $\\hat y_i^{(z)} = \\hat y_i$. The fitted values are identical for both models. Consequently, the residuals $e_i = y_i - \\hat y_i$ are also identical, the RSS is identical, and the estimated error variance is identical. Let's call it $\\hat\\sigma^2$ for both models.\n\nNow, we can compute the standard errors.\nFor Model 1:\n$$ \\text{SE}(\\hat\\beta_1) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat\\sigma^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar x)^2}} = \\frac{\\hat\\sigma}{\\sqrt{(n-1)s_x^2}} = \\frac{\\hat\\sigma}{s_x \\sqrt{n-1}} $$\nThe $t$-statistic is:\n$$ t_1 = \\frac{\\hat\\beta_1}{\\text{SE}(\\hat\\beta_1)} = \\frac{\\hat\\beta_1 s_x \\sqrt{n-1}}{\\hat\\sigma} $$\nFor Model 2:\n$$ \\text{SE}(\\hat\\beta_1^{(z)}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat\\sigma^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n (z_i - \\bar z)^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat\\sigma^2}{n-1}} = \\frac{\\hat\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n-1}} $$\nThe $t$-statistic is:\n$$ t_1^{(z)} = \\frac{\\hat\\beta_1^{(z)}}{\\text{SE}(\\hat\\beta_1^{(z)})} = \\frac{s_x \\hat\\beta_1}{\\hat\\sigma / \\sqrt{n-1}} = \\frac{\\hat\\beta_1 s_x \\sqrt{n-1}}{\\hat\\sigma} $$\nComparing the final expressions, we see that $t_1^{(z)} = t_1$.\n\n*Alternative Derivation for the t-statistic:*\nThe $t$-statistic for testing the significance of the slope in simple linear regression can also be expressed in terms of the Pearson correlation coefficient $r$ between the predictor and the response:\n$$ t = \\frac{r\\sqrt{n-2}}{\\sqrt{1-r^2}} $$\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient is invariant to separate linear transformations of the two variables. That is, if $X' = aX+b$ and $Y' = cY+d$, then $|\\text{Corr}(X', Y')| = |\\text{Corr}(X, Y)|$. If $a$ and $c$ have the same sign, $\\text{Corr}(X', Y') = \\text{Corr}(X, Y)$.\nIn our case, the response $y$ is unchanged. The predictor is transformed from $x$ to $z$ via $z_i = \\frac{1}{s_x} x_i - \\frac{\\bar x}{s_x}$. This is a linear transformation with a positive scaling factor $\\frac{1}{s_x}$ (since $s_x  0$). Therefore, the correlation between $z$ and $y$ is the same as the correlation between $x$ and $y$:\n$$ r_{zy} = \\text{Corr}(z, y) = \\text{Corr}(x, y) = r_{xy} $$\nSince the $t$-statistic depends only on the sample size $n$ and the correlation coefficient $r$, and both are identical for the two models, the $t$-statistics themselves must be identical.\n$$ t_1 = \\frac{r_{xy}\\sqrt{n-2}}{\\sqrt{1-r_{xy}^2}} = \\frac{r_{zy}\\sqrt{n-2}}{\\sqrt{1-r_{zy}^2}} = t_1^{(z)} $$\nBoth derivations confirm that $t_1^{(z)} = t_1$.\n\nIn summary:\n- $\\hat\\beta_1^{(z)} = s_x \\hat\\beta_1$\n- $t_1^{(z)} = t_1$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $\\hat\\beta_1^{(z)} = s_x \\hat\\beta_1$ and $t_1^{(z)} = t_1$.**\n- The first part, $\\hat\\beta_1^{(z)} = s_x \\hat\\beta_1$, is consistent with our derivation.\n- The second part, $t_1^{(z)} = t_1$, is also consistent with our derivation.\n- This statement is **Correct**.\n\n**B. $\\hat\\beta_1^{(z)} = \\hat\\beta_1/s_x$ and $t_1^{(z)} = t_1$.**\n- The first part, $\\hat\\beta_1^{(z)} = \\hat\\beta_1/s_x$, contradicts our finding that $\\hat\\beta_1^{(z)} = s_x \\hat\\beta_1$.

I will proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the variance of the OLS estimator $\\hat{\\beta}_2$. We are invited to work from first principles, including the idea of orthogonal projections. The Frisch-Waugh-Lovell (FWL) theorem is the relevant principle here. It states that the coefficient $\\hat{\\beta}_2$ in the multiple regression is identical to the coefficient of a simple regression of $Y_{\\perp 1}$ on $x_{2, \\perp 1}$, where $Y_{\\perp 1}$ is the vector of residuals from regressing $Y$ on $x_1$, and $x_{2, \\perp 1}$ is the vector of residuals from regressing $x_2$ on $x_1$.\n\nThe variance of $\\hat{\\beta}_2$ is given by:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_2) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\|\\mathbf{x}_{2, \\perp 1}\\|^2} $$\nwhere $\\|\\mathbf{x}_{2, \\perp 1}\\|^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_{2i, \\perp 1})^2$ is the sum of squared residuals from regressing $\\mathbf{x}_2$ on $\\mathbf{x}_1$.\n\nLet's compute these residuals. The model is $\\mathbf{x}_2 = \\gamma_1 \\mathbf{x}_1 + \\text{error}$. Since the predictors are centered, the intercept is $0$. The OLS estimate for $\\gamma_1$ is $\\hat{\\gamma}_1 = (\\mathbf{x}_1^\\top \\mathbf{x}_1)^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_1^\\top \\mathbf{x}_2$. The residual vector is $\\mathbf{x}_{2, \\perp 1} = \\mathbf{x}_2 - \\hat{\\gamma}_1 \\mathbf{x}_1$.\nUsing the problem's definition $\\mathbf{x}_2 = \\mathbf{x}_1 + \\mathbf{\\delta}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{x}_{2, \\perp 1} = (\\mathbf{x}_1 + \\mathbf{\\delta}) - \\hat{\\gamma}_1 \\mathbf{x}_1 $$\nWait, it is simpler to use the projection matrix formulation. Let $P_1$ be the projection onto the space spanned by $\\mathbf{x}_1$. Then $\\mathbf{x}_{2, \\perp 1} = (I - P_1)\\mathbf{x}_2$.\nSubstituting $\\mathbf{x}_2 = \\mathbf{x}_1 + \\mathbf{\\delta}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{x}_{2, \\perp 1} = (I - P_1)(\\mathbf{x}_1 + \\mathbf{\\delta}) = (I - P_1)\\mathbf{x}_1 + (I - P_1)\\mathbf{\\delta} = \\mathbf{0} + (I - P_1)\\mathbf{\\delta} $$\nThe term $(I - P_1)\\mathbf{x}_1$ is zero because $\\mathbf{x}_1$ is in its own column space. Thus, the residuals of $\\mathbf{x}_2$ on $\\mathbf{x}_1$ are precisely the residuals of $\\mathbf{\\delta}$ on $\\mathbf{x}_1$.\nThe denominator for the variance of $\\hat{\\beta}_2$ is the squared norm of this residual vector:\n$$ \\|\\mathbf{x}_{2, \\perp 1}\\|^2 = \\|(I - P_1)\\mathbf{\\delta}\\|^2 = \\text{RSS}_{\\delta \\sim x_1} $$\nThis is the residual sum of squares from regressing $\\mathbf{\\delta}$ on $\\mathbf{x}_1$. This is the \"component of $\\mathbf{\\delta}$ orthogonal to $\\mathbf{x}_1$\".\n\nThe problem states that $x_1$ and $\\delta$ are independent. In a finite sample, this does not guarantee that the sample correlation is zero (i.e., $\\sum x_{1i}\\delta_i = 0$). However, for this type of theoretical analysis, it is standard to assume sample properties reflect population properties, which implies sample orthogonality. Let's assume $\\sum_{i=1}^n x_{1i}\\delta_i = 0$. This means that in our sample, $\\mathbf{x}_1$ and $\\mathbf{\\delta}$ are orthogonal.\nUnder this standard idealization, the regression of $\\mathbf{\\delta}$ on $\\mathbf{x}_1$ yields a zero coefficient, and the residuals are just $\\mathbf{\\delta}$ itself.\n$$ \\text{If } \\mathbf{x}_1^\\top \\mathbf{\\delta} = 0, \\text{ then } \\mathbf{x}_{2, \\perp 1} = (I-P_1)\\mathbf{\\delta} = \\mathbf{\\delta}. $$\nTherefore, $\\|\\mathbf{x}_{2, \\perp 1}\\|^2 = \\|\\mathbf{\\delta}\\|^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\delta_i^2$.\nSince $\\delta$ is a mean-0 perturbation, its sample variance (using $n$ in the denominator for simplicity, as is common) is $\\frac{1}{n} \\sum \\delta_i^2$. The problem gives this quantity as $\\tau^2 = \\operatorname{Var}(\\delta)$. So, $\\sum \\delta_i^2 = n \\tau^2 = n \\operatorname{Var}(\\delta)$.\n\nThus, under this standard simplification, we have:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_2) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\delta_i^2} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n \\tau^2} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n \\operatorname{Var}(\\delta)} $$\nAs $\\tau^2 \\to 0$, this variance grows without bound.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In this construction with $x_2 = x_1 + \\delta$ and centered predictors, the sampling variance of $\\hat{\\beta}_2$ equals $\\sigma^2 \\big/ \\big(n\\, \\operatorname{Var}(\\delta)\\big)$, so as $\\tau^2 \\to 0$ it diverges.**\n\nAs derived above, under the standard simplifying assumption of sample orthogonality ($\\sum x_{1i}\\delta_i=0$) that is characteristic of such theoretical problems, the variance is precisely $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_2) = \\sigma^2 / (n \\operatorname{Var}(\\delta))$. The quantity $\\operatorname{Var}(\\delta)$ is denoted $\\tau^2$. As $\\tau^2 \\to 0$, the denominator approaches $0$, and thus the variance diverges to infinity. Even without the simplifying assumption, the denominator $\\text{RSS}_{\\delta \\sim x_1}$ is of order $n\\tau^2$, so the conclusion that the variance diverges remains correct. The statement is a correct representation of the effect of near-collinearity.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The variance inflation factor linking $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_2)$ to the univariate regression variance is $(1 - R_2^2)^{-1}$, where $R_2^2$ is from regressing $x_2$ on $x_1$. In this setup $R_2^2 = v_1/(v_1+\\tau^2)$, so the inflation factor equals $(v_1+\\tau^2)/\\tau^2$ and grows without bound as $\\tau^2 \\to 0$.**\n\nThe variance inflation factor for $\\hat{\\beta}_2$ is $\\text{VIF}_2 = (1 - R_2^2)^{-1}$, where $R_2^2$ is the coefficient of determination from regressing $x_2$ on $x_1$.\n$R_2^2$ is defined as the square of the correlation between $x_1$ and $x_2$. For centered variables, $R_2^2= (\\sum x_{1i}x_{2i})^2 / ((\\sum x_{1i}^2)(\\sum x_{2i}^2))$.\nLet's use our simplified quantities:\n- $\\sum x_{1i}^2 = n \\operatorname{Var}(x_1) = n v_1$.\n- $\\sum x_{2i}^2 = \\sum (x_{1i}+\\delta_i)^2 = \\sum x_{1i}^2 + \\sum \\delta_i^2 + 2\\sum x_{1i}\\delta_i = n v_1 + n \\tau^2 + 0 = n(v_1+\\tau^2)$.\n- $\\sum x_{1i}x_{2i} = \\sum x_{1i}(x_{1i}+\\delta_i) = \\sum x_{1i}^2 + \\sum x_{1i}\\delta_i = n v_1 + 0 = n v_1$.\n\nPlugging these in:\n$$ R_2^2 = \\frac{(n v_1)^2}{(n v_1)(n(v_1+\\tau^2))} = \\frac{v_1}{v_1 + \\tau^2} $$\nThis matches the formula in the option. As $\\tau^2 \\to 0$, $R_2^2 \\to v_1/v_1 = 1$, indicating perfect collinearity.\nThe inflation factor is:\n$$ \\text{VIF}_2 = \\frac{1}{1 - R_2^2} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{v_1}{v_1+\\tau^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{(v_1+\\tau^2)-v_1}{v_1+\\tau^2}} = \\frac{v_1+\\tau^2}{\\tau^2} $$\nThis also matches the formula in the option. As $\\tau^2 \\to 0$, the numerator approaches $v_1  0$ and the denominator approaches $0$, so the VIF grows without bound. This statement is entirely correct.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. A model can have $R^2$ arbitrarily close to $1$ because of $x_1$ while the test of $H_0:\\beta_2=0$ yields a small $|t_2|$, since only the component of $x_2$ orthogonal to $x_1$ (namely $\\delta$) informs $\\beta_2$, and its variance is small.**\n\nThis statement provides the conceptual explanation for the phenomenon of multicollinearity.\n1.  **High $R^2$**: If $x_1$ is a strong predictor of $Y$, the overall model $R^2$ can be high regardless of the contribution of $x_2$.\n2.  **Small $|t_2|$**: The $t$-statistic for $\\beta_2$ is $t_2 = \\hat{\\beta}_2 / \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_2)$. As shown in A and B, near-collinearity causes the standard error $\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_2)$ to become very large. Even if the true $\\beta_2$ is non-zero, a large denominator will result in a small $|t_2|$, leading to a failure to reject $H_0: \\beta_2 = 0$.\n3.  **Reason**: The reasoning provided is precisely correct and follows from the FWL theorem. The unique information contributed by $x_2$ for estimating its coefficient $\\beta_2$ is contained in its component orthogonal to $x_1$. We showed this component is $(I-P_1)\\mathbf{\\delta}$. The \"variance\" of this component (its sum of squares) is $\\|\\mathbf{x}_{2, \\perp 1}\\|^2 \\approx n\\tau^2$, which is small when $\\tau^2$ is small. A small amount of information leads to high uncertainty in the estimate, i.e., a large standard error.\nThe statement correctly identifies the classic symptom (high overall $R^2$, low individual $|t|$-statistics) and cause of multicollinearity.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. Because the residual standard error $s$ decreases when more predictors are added, $|t_2|$ must increase when $x_2$ is added to a model that already contains $x_1$.**\n\nThis statement is flawed for two reasons.\n1.  The premise, \"the residual standard error $s$ decreases when more predictors are added,\" is not strictly true. The residual standard error is $s = \\sqrt{\\text{RSS}/(n-p-1)}$. Adding a predictor never increases RSS, but it decreases the degrees of freedom in the denominator $(n-p-1)$. If the reduction in RSS is trivial, $s$ can actually increase.\n2.  More importantly, the conclusion is the opposite of the truth. The $t$-statistic is $t_2 = \\hat{\\beta}_2 / \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_2)$. The standard error is $\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_2) = s / \\sqrt{\\|\\mathbf{x}_{2, \\perp 1}\\|^2}$. In the context of near-collinearity, the denominator term $\\|\\mathbf{x}_{2, \\perp 1}\\|^2$ is very small (approaching $0$). This makes $\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_2)$ very large, which in turn makes $|t_2|$ *small*, not large. The statement makes a claim that directly contradicts the primary effect of multicollinearity.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Near-collinearity induces bias in $\\hat{\\beta}_2$ toward $0$, which is the primary reason $|t_2|$ is small even when $R^2$ is large.**\n\nThis statement misattributes the effect of multicollinearity. The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator is unbiased as long as the Gauss-Markov assumptions hold, which they do in this problem's setup (specifically, $E[\\varepsilon|X]=0$).\nThe expected value of the OLS estimator is $E[\\hat{\\beta}] = \\beta$. This holds regardless of the degree of collinearity, as long as it is not perfect (i.e., $X^\\top X$ is invertible). Near-collinearity does not introduce bias. Instead, it inflates the *variance* of the estimators. The primary reason $|t_2|$ is small is the large standard error (the denominator of the $t$-statistic), not a bias in the estimate $\\hat{\\beta}_2$ (the numerator).\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "3131116"}]}
