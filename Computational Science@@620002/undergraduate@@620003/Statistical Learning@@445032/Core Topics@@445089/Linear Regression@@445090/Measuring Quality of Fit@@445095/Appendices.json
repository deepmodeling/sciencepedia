For linear regression, one of the most critical assumptions is homoscedasticityâ€”the idea that the variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the predictor variables. This exercise challenges you to identify the specific diagnostic plot designed to visually inspect this very assumption, a fundamental skill in applied modeling. [@problem_id:1936312]", "problem": "An analyst is evaluating the fit of a simple linear regression model, given by $Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i + \\epsilon_i$, where the error terms $\\epsilon_i$ are assumed to be independent and identically distributed random variables with a mean of zero and a constant variance $\\sigma^2$. To check the validity of the model's assumptions, the analyst produces a series of diagnostic plots.\n\nOne of these plots is the Scale-Location plot (also known as the Spread-Location plot). This plot graphs the square root of the absolute value of the standardized residuals on the vertical axis against the fitted response values, $\\hat{Y}_i$, on the horizontal axis.\n\nThis specific diagnostic plot is primarily designed to assess which of the following foundational assumptions of the linear regression model?\n\nA. The functional form of the model is linear.\n\nB. The error terms are independent of one another.\n\nC. The error terms have a constant variance (homoscedasticity).\n\nD. The error terms are normally distributed.\n\nE. There is no significant multicollinearity among the predictor variables.", "solution": "We consider the simple linear regression model $Y_{i}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}X_{i}+\\epsilon_{i}$ with $\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_{i}]=0$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(\\epsilon_{i})=\\sigma^{2}$ for all $i$, and independent errors. Let the fitted values be $\\hat{Y}_{i}$ and the ordinary residuals be $e_{i}=Y_{i}-\\hat{Y}_{i}$. In linear regression, the variance of $e_{i}$ under homoscedasticity satisfies $\\operatorname{Var}(e_{i})=\\sigma^{2}(1-h_{ii})$, where $h_{ii}$ are the diagonal elements of the hat matrix, capturing leverage.\n\nStandardized residuals are given by $r_{i}=e_{i}/\\left(\\hat{\\sigma}\\sqrt{1-h_{ii}}\\right)$, where $\\hat{\\sigma}$ is an estimator of $\\sigma$. Under the assumption of constant error variance, we have approximately $\\operatorname{Var}(r_{i})\\approx 1$ and, crucially, there should be no systematic relationship between $\\{|r_{i}|\\}$ (or functions thereof) and the fitted values $\\hat{Y}_{i}$.\n\nThe Scale-Location (Spread-Location) plot graphs $\\sqrt{|r_{i}|}$ against $\\hat{Y}_{i}$. This transformation stabilizes the variance and linearizes the relationship between the spread of residuals and the fitted values. If the assumption of homoscedasticity holds, the conditional spread of $\\sqrt{|r_{i}|}$ should be roughly constant across the range of $\\hat{Y}_{i}$, exhibiting no systematic trend. Conversely, a pattern such as an increasing or decreasing trend (fan shape) indicates heteroscedasticity, i.e., that $\\operatorname{Var}(\\epsilon_{i})$ depends on the level of the fitted values.\n\nTherefore, this diagnostic specifically targets the constant-variance (homoscedasticity) assumption. Other assumptions are assessed by different diagnostics: linearity is commonly checked via residuals versus fitted values (examining the mean structure), normality via a normal Q-Q plot of residuals, independence via residuals versus time or the Durbin-Watson statistic, and multicollinearity via variance inflation factors, which is not addressed by this plot and is not applicable in a simple regression with a single predictor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1936312"}, {"introduction": "In classification tasks, especially with imbalanced datasets, a single accuracy score can be highly misleading.
