The study must begin from the definition of a smoothing spline as the minimizer of a penalized least squares functional. Specifically, consider the space of twice-differentiable functions and the fundamental variational formulation: for given observations $\\{(x_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$ and nonnegative weights $\\{w_i\\}_{i=1}^n$, the smoothing spline estimator $\\hat{f}$ is defined as the minimizer over functions $f$ of the objective\n$$\nJ[f] = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i^2 \\left(y_i - f(x_i)\\right)^2 + \\lambda \\int_{a}^{b} \\left(f''(t)\\right)^2 \\, dt,\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda \\ge 0$ controls smoothness and $[a,b]$ is the training domain. For cubic smoothing splines with natural boundary conditions, the resulting $\\hat{f}$ is a natural cubic spline, which extrapolates linearly outside $[a,b]$. This linear extrapolation can introduce artificial tails when the true function has compact support.\n\nConstruct a program that implements the following protocol in a fully deterministic way.\n\n1) Data-generating process.\n- Define the true compactly supported target function $f^\\star(x)$ by\n$$\nf^\\star(x) = \\max\\left(0, 1 - |x|\\right),\n$$\nwhich has support on $[-1,1]$.\n- Define a deterministic additive disturbance $\\varepsilon(x)$ by\n$$\n\\varepsilon(x) = 0.05 \\sin(13 x) + 0.02 \\cos(7 x),\n$$\nwith angles in radians.\n- Define the training input grid $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ as $n$ equally spaced points on $[-1.2, 1.2]$ with $n = 481$. Define the responses $y_i = f^\\star(x_i) + \\varepsilon(x_i)$.\n\n2) Baseline smoothing spline.\n- Fit a cubic smoothing spline $\\hat{f}_{\\text{base}}$ to $\\{(x_i, y_i)\\}$ using unit weights, with smoothing factor chosen by the test suite described below. Use the standard natural boundary conditions implied by the cubic smoothing spline formulation.\n\n3) Boundary-knot remedy.\n- Form an augmented dataset by adding high-confidence boundary anchors at the known support edges to discourage boundary linear extrapolation from producing nonzero tails. Specifically, add the four anchor points at\n$$\nx = -1.000,\\quad x = -1.000 + 10^{-3},\\quad x = 1.000 - 10^{-3},\\quad x = 1.000,\n$$\nwith responses fixed to $0$. Assign unit weights to the original $n$ training points and a large weight $W = 1000$ to each of the four anchors. Fit a cubic smoothing spline $\\hat{f}_{\\text{anch}}$ to this augmented and weighted dataset using the same smoothing factor as the baseline.\n\n4) Tail metric.\n- To quantify artificial tails due to linear extrapolation beyond the observed range, evaluate each fitted function on the tail regions outside the training domain where no data were used for fitting. Define the two disjoint tail intervals as $[-1.8, -1.2]$ and $[1.2, 1.8]$. On each tail interval, sample $M = 301$ equally spaced points, and define the aggregate tail grid of size $2M$. For any fitted function $\\hat{f}$, define the tail magnitude\n$$\nT(\\hat{f}) = \\frac{1}{2M}\\sum_{j=1}^{2M} \\left| \\hat{f}(z_j) \\right|,\n$$\nwhere $\\{z_j\\}_{j=1}^{2M}$ are the tail grid points concatenated from the two intervals.\n\n5) Output metric.\n- For each test case, compute the ratio\n$$\nR = \\frac{T\\left(\\hat{f}_{\\text{anch}}\\right)}{T\\left(\\hat{f}_{\\text{base}}\\right)},\n$$\nwith the convention that if $T\\left(\\hat{f}_{\\text{base}}\\right)$ equals $0$, replace the denominator by $\\max\\left(T\\left(\\hat{f}_{\\text{base}}\\right), 10^{-12}\\right)$ to avoid division by zero.\n\nTest Suite:\n- Use the following smoothing factors (the second term in the objective above is controlled via the smoothing factor as implemented by the cubic smoothing spline routine; each value yields a different compromise between fidelity and smoothness):\n    - Case A: $s = 0.05$.\n    - Case B: $s = 0.5$.\n    - Case C: $s = 2.0$.\n\nFor each case, run Steps $1$â€“$5$ and record the ratio $R$ as a floating-point number.\n\nFinal Output Format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the three ratios $[R_A, R_B, R_C]$ as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. Each ratio must be rounded to exactly six digits after the decimal point. For example, the output format must look like\n$$\n[\\;0.123456,0.234567,0.345678\\;].\n$$\nNo other text must be printed.", "solution": "The problem asks for a quantitative analysis of artificial tail generation by cubic smoothing splines and a proposed remedy using boundary anchor points. The validation process confirms that the problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and all necessary components are unambiguously defined. The problem is therefore valid. We proceed with the solution protocol.\n\nThe fundamental principle behind a cubic smoothing spline $\\hat{f}$ is the minimization of a penalized sum of squares:\n$$\nJ[f] = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i^2 \\left(y_i - f(x_i)\\right)^2 + \\lambda \\int_{a}^{b} \\left(f''(t)\\right)^2 \\, dt\n$$\nThe first term measures fidelity to the data $\\{(x_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$ with weights $\\{w_i\\}_{i=1}^n$, while the second term penalizes roughness, measured by the integrated squared second derivative. The parameter $\\lambda \\ge 0$ controls the trade-off. The solution to this variational problem with natural boundary conditions, $f''(a) = 0$ and $f''(b) = 0$, is a natural cubic spline. A key characteristic of such a spline is that it extrapolates linearly outside the interval $[a, b]$ defined by the data. When the true function has compact support, this linear extrapolation can introduce non-physical, non-zero tails.\n\nThe implementation will follow the specified steps, using the `scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline` function, which is designed for this purpose. This function uses a smoothing factor $s$ that is related to $\\lambda$; it finds the spline $f$ that minimizes $\\int (f''(t))^2 dt$ subject to the constraint $\\sum_i w_i^2 (y_i - f(x_i))^2 \\le s$.\n\n**Step 1: Data-Generating Process**\nWe first define the components for generating the synthetic data in a deterministic manner.\nThe true regression function is a triangular or \"tent\" function, $f^\\star(x)$, with compact support on $[-1, 1]$:\n$$\nf^\\star(x) = \\max(0, 1 - |x|)\n$$\nA deterministic, high-frequency disturbance, $\\varepsilon(x)$, is added to the true function to simulate noise:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(x) = 0.05 \\sin(13x) + 0.02 \\cos(7x)\n$$\nThe training data consists of $n=481$ points. The inputs $\\{x_i\\}$ are generated as an equally spaced grid over the interval $[-1.2, 1.2]$. The corresponding responses $\\{y_i\\}$ are computed as:\n$$\ny_i = f^\\star(x_i) + \\varepsilon(x_i)\n$$\nThis grid of $x_i$ values intentionally extends beyond the support of $f^\\star(x)$.\n\n**Step 2: Baseline Smoothing Spline**\nFor each smoothing factor $s$ in the test suite $\\{0.05, 0.5, 2.0\\}$, we first fit a baseline cubic smoothing spline, $\\hat{f}_{\\text{base}}$. This is done by applying `UnivariateSpline` to the training data $\\{(x_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^{481}$ with unit weights (i.e., $w_i=1$ for all $i$). The function will extrapolate linearly outside the data interval $[-1.2, 1.2]$. Since the observations $y_i$ for $|x_i| > 1$ are non-zero due to the disturbance $\\varepsilon(x_i)$, the spline is likely to have a non-zero slope at the boundaries $x=\\pm 1.2$, leading to significant artificial tails.\n\n**Step 3: Boundary-Knot Remedy**\nTo counteract the artifact of linear extrapolation, we implement the proposed boundary-knot remedy. We construct an augmented dataset by adding four anchor points at the known edges of the support of $f^\\star(x)$. These points are:\n$$\n(-1.000, 0), \\quad (-1.000 + 10^{-3}, 0), \\quad (1.000 - 10^{-3}, 0), \\quad (1.000, 0)\n$$\nThese anchors serve as high-confidence statements that the function should be zero at and very near its support boundaries. To enforce this, they are assigned a large weight $W=1000$, while the original $n=481$ data points retain their unit weights. A new cubic smoothing spline, $\\hat{f}_{\\text{anch}}$, is fitted to this combined and weighted dataset, using the same smoothing factor $s$ as the corresponding baseline model. The large weights on the anchor points will strongly penalize any deviation from $0$ at these locations, effectively 'anchoring' the spline to the x-axis and thereby suppressing the linear tails. When constructing the input for the spline fitter, the combined data points must be sorted by their $x$-coordinate.\n\n**Step 4: Tail Metric Calculation**\nTo quantify the magnitude of the artificial tails, we define a specific evaluation metric. We create a tail evaluation grid consisting of $2M$ points, where $M=301$. This grid is the union of two disjoint intervals outside the training range: $[-1.8, -1.2]$ and $[1.2, 1.8]$. Let these grid points be denoted by $\\{z_j\\}_{j=1}^{2M}$. For any fitted spline $\\hat{f}$, its tail magnitude $T(\\hat{f})$ is defined as the mean absolute value of the function evaluated on this grid:\n$$\nT(\\hat{f}) = \\frac{1}{2M}\\sum_{j=1}^{2M} | \\hat{f}(z_j) |\n$$\nWe calculate this metric for both the baseline spline, $T(\\hat{f}_{\\text{base}})$, and the anchored spline, $T(\\hat{f}_{\\text{anch}})$.\n\n**Step 5: Output Metric Computation**\nThe effectiveness of the anchoring remedy is measured by the ratio $R$ of the tail magnitudes:\n$$\nR = \\frac{T(\\hat{f}_{\\text{anch}})}{T(\\hat{f}_{\\text{base}})}\n$$\nA ratio $R<1$ signifies a reduction in the artificial tails due to the anchoring procedure. To handle cases where the baseline spline might have zero tails (which is unlikely in this problem but represents good numerical practice), the denominator is floored at a small positive value, $10^{-12}$. This procedure is repeated for each of the three test cases corresponding to $s \\in \\{0.05, 0.5, 2.0\\}$, and the resulting three ratios are reported.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.interpolate import UnivariateSpline\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements the full protocol to compare a baseline smoothing spline\n    with a boundary-knot corrected spline for a function with compact support.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases_s = [\n        0.05,  # Case A\n        0.5,   # Case B\n        2.0,   # Case C\n    ]\n\n    # --- Step 1: Data-generating process (common for all cases) ---\n    \n    # Define the true compactly supported target function f_star(x)\n    def f_star(x):\n        return np.maximum(0, 1 - np.abs(x))\n\n    # Define the deterministic additive disturbance epsilon(x)\n    def epsilon(x):\n        return 0.05 * np.sin(13 * x) + 0.02 * np.cos(7 * x)\n\n    # Define the training input grid {x_i} and responses {y_i}\n    n = 481\n    x_train = np.linspace(-1.2, 1.2, n)\n    y_train = f_star(x_train) + epsilon(x_train)\n    w_train = np.ones(n)\n\n    # --- Step 4 (part 1): Tail metric setup (common for all cases) ---\n    \n    # Define the tail evaluation grid {z_j}\n    M = 301\n    z_left = np.linspace(-1.8, -1.2, M)\n    z_right = np.linspace(1.2, 1.8, M)\n    z_tail = np.concatenate((z_left, z_right))\n\n    # Define the tail magnitude function T(f)\n    def calculate_tail_magnitude(spline, z_grid):\n        return np.mean(np.abs(spline(z_grid)))\n\n    # --- Loop through test cases ---\n    results = []\n    for s_val in test_cases_s:\n        \n        # --- Step 2: Baseline smoothing spline ---\n        # Fit f_base to {(x_i, y_i)} with unit weights.\n        # UnivariateSpline's default for `w` is None, which implies unit weights.\n        f_base = UnivariateSpline(x_train, y_train, s=s_val)\n        \n        # --- Step 3: Boundary-knot remedy ---\n        \n        # Define anchor points and their high weights\n        x_anchor = np.array([-1.0, -1.0 + 1e-3, 1.0 - 1e-3, 1.0])\n        y_anchor = np.array([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0])\n        W = 1000.0\n        w_anchor = np.full(4, W)\n        \n        # Form the augmented dataset\n        x_aug = np.concatenate((x_train, x_anchor))\n        y_aug = np.concatenate((y_train, y_anchor))\n        w_aug = np.concatenate((w_train, w_anchor))\n        \n        # Sort the augmented data by x-values, as required by UnivariateSpline\n        sort_indices = np.argsort(x_aug)\n        x_aug_sorted = x_aug[sort_indices]\n        y_aug_sorted = y_aug[sort_indices]\n        w_aug_sorted = w_aug[sort_indices]\n        \n        # Fit the anchored spline f_anch to the augmented data\n        f_anch = UnivariateSpline(x_aug_sorted, y_aug_sorted, w=w_aug_sorted, s=s_val)\n\n        # --- Step 4 (part 2): Calculate tail magnitudes for this case ---\n        T_base = calculate_tail_magnitude(f_base, z_tail)\n        T_anch = calculate_tail_magnitude(f_anch, z_tail)\n        \n        # --- Step 5: Output metric ---\n        # Calculate the ratio R, avoiding division by zero\n        denominator = max(T_base, 1e-12)\n        R = T_anch / denominator\n        results.append(R)\n\n    # Format the final list of ratios as specified.\n    # Each ratio must be rounded to exactly six digits after the decimal point.\n    formatted_results = [f\"{r:.6f}\" for r in results]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\n# Execute the main function to produce the final output.\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3174194"}, {"introduction": "Every linear smoother, including the smoothing spline, can be understood through its \"equivalent kernel,\" which describes how the estimate at a target point is formed as a weighted average of the observed data.

The core principle is that the smoothing spline estimator $\\hat{\\mathbf{f}}$ at a set of design points $\\mathbf{x} = (x_0, \\dots, x_{n-1})^\\top$ linearly transforms the observed data vector $\\mathbf{y}$, such that $\\hat{\\mathbf{f}} = \\mathbf{S}_\\lambda \\mathbf{y}$. The matrix $\\mathbf{S}_\\lambda$ is known as the smoother matrix or equivalent kernel. The rows of this matrix, $\\mathbf{k}^{(i)}$, determine how the estimate at a single point, $\\hat{f}(x_i)$, is constructed as a weighted average of all observations, $\\hat{f}(x_i) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} S_{\\lambda,ij} y_j$. The shape of these rows (the \"equivalent kernel\") reveals the behavior of the smoother. Adversarial point placements can distort these kernel functions, leading to poor statistical properties such as high bias.\n\nThe step-by-step implementation proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Generate Design Points**: For each of the four test cases, we first generate the vector of $n=51$ design points, $\\mathbf{x}$, on the interval $[0,1]$ according to the specified rule.\n\n2.  **Construct Penalty Matrix $\\mathbf{Q}$**: The penalty term $\\lambda \\int (f'')^2 dt$ is discretized as $\\lambda \\mathbf{f}^\\top \\mathbf{Q} \\mathbf{f}$. The construction of $\\mathbf{Q}$ requires two intermediate matrices, $\\mathbf{D}$ and $\\mathbf{W}$.\n    -   Compute the spacings $h_i = x_{i+1} - x_i$ for $i=0, \\dots, n-2$.\n    -   The $(n-2) \\times n$ matrix $\\mathbf{D}$ is constructed. Its $j$-th row (for $j=0, \\dots, n-3$) contains the coefficients for the finite-difference approximation of the second derivative at the interior point $x_{i}$ where $i=j+1$. The non-zero entries in row $j$ are located at columns $i-1$, $i$, and $i+1$. The coefficients depend on $h_{i-1}$ and $h_i$.\n    -   The $(n-2) \\times (n-2)$ diagonal matrix $\\mathbf{W}$ is constructed.

The problem specifies a clamped open knot vector on the domain $[a, b]$. For a basis with $d$ functions of degree $p$, the knot vector $T$ must contain $d+p+1$ knots. A clamped vector is constructed by repeating the start point $a$ and end point $b$ each $p+1$ times. The remaining $K = (d+p+1) - 2(p+1) = d-p-1$ knots are the interior knots, located in the open interval $(a, b)$.\n\nThe full knot vector $T$ is given by:\n$$\nT = [\\underbrace{a, \\dots, a}_{p+1 \\text{ times}}, t_{p+2}, \\dots, t_{d}, \\underbrace{b, \\dots, b}_{p+1 \\text{ times}}]\n$$\nThe configuration of the $K$ interior knots is specified for each test case:\n- **Uniform knots**: The $K$ knots are placed uniformly in $(a,b)$, at locations $a + i \\cdot \\frac{b-a}{K+1}$ for $i=1, \\dots, K$.\n- **Jittered knots**: Starting with uniform knot positions $u_i = a + i \\cdot \\frac{b-a}{K+1}$, a deterministic sinusoidal jitter is added. A principled choice for a deterministic jitter is to make it a function of the knot's relative position in the interval, i.e., $v_i = u_i + A \\sin(2\\pi (u_i-a)/(b-a))$, with amplitude $A=0.03$.

The problem defines its action as $(\\mathbf{D} \\beta)_i = \\sum_{k=0}^{m} (-1)^k \\binom{m}{k} \\beta_{i+k}$. For this task, $m=2$, so the operator involves coefficients $\\binom{2}{0}=1$, $-\\binom{2}{1}=-2$, and $\\binom{2}{2}=1$.
