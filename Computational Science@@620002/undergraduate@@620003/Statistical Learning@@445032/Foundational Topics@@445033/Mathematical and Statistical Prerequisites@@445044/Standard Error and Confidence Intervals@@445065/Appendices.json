It is a well-formulated conceptual question in regression analysis. I will now proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis is centered on the formula for the variance, and consequently the standard error, of the OLS intercept estimator, $\\hat{\\beta}_0$. In a simple linear regression model, the OLS estimators are given by:\n$$ \\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} $$\n$$ \\hat{\\beta}_0 = \\bar{y} - \\hat{\\beta}_1 \\bar{x} $$\nwhere $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$ and $\\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i$.\n\nTo find the standard error of $\\hat{\\beta}_0$, we must first derive its variance. We use the properties of variance and the fact that under the model assumptions, $\\operatorname{Cov}(\\bar{y}, \\hat{\\beta}_1) = 0$.\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_0) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{y} - \\hat{\\beta}_1 \\bar{x}) $$\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_0) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{y}) + \\bar{x}^2 \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_1) - 2\\bar{x}\\operatorname{Cov}(\\bar{y}, \\hat{\\beta}_1) $$\nThe required components are:\n-   $\\operatorname{Var}(\\bar{y}) = \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i\\right) = \\frac{1}{n^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\operatorname{Var}(y_i) = \\frac{n\\sigma^2}{n^2} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}$.\n-   $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_1) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}$.\n-   $\\operatorname{Cov}(\\bar{y}, \\hat{\\beta}_1) = 0$. This is a standard result; a centered predictor is uncorrelated with the sample mean of the response.\n\nSubstituting these into the variance expression for $\\hat{\\beta}_0$:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_0) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} + \\bar{x}^2 \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} $$\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_0) = \\sigma^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{\\bar{x}^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\right) $$\n\nThe standard error, $\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_0)$, is the square root of the estimated variance, where $\\sigma^2$ is replaced by its estimator $\\hat{\\sigma}^2$ (the residual variance, often written as $s^2$ or $RSE^2$).\n$$ \\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_0) = \\hat{\\sigma} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{\\bar{x}^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}} $$\nThe width of a $95\\%$ confidence interval for $\\beta_0$ is proportional to $\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_0)$: $2 \\times t_{n-2, 0.975} \\times \\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_0)$. Since $n$ and $\\hat{\\sigma}$ are assumed to be constant across designs, the width is determined by the term under the square root.\n\nThis formula reveals two key dependencies:\n1.  The standard error increases as $|\\bar{x}|$ increases, due to the $\\bar{x}^2$ term. This reflects the uncertainty introduced by extrapolating from the center of the data ($\\bar{x}$) to the y-axis intercept at $x=0$.\n2.  The standard error decreases as the spread of the predictor, $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2$, increases. A larger spread provides a more stable regression line.\n\nThe problem states that the predictor range is \"tiny\" for all three designs. Let us analyze the designs:\n-   All designs have $n=30$ and a predictor range of $0.4$. Since the points are uniformly spaced, the sum of squared deviations, $S_{xx} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2$, will be identical and small for all three designs.\n-   The critical difference lies in the mean of the predictors, $\\bar{x}$:\n    -   **Design A:** $x_i \\in [9.8, 10.2] \\implies \\bar{x}_A = 10.0$.\n    -   **Design B:** $x_i \\in [0.0, 0.4] \\implies \\bar{x}_B = 0.2$.\n    -   **Design C:** $x_i \\in [-0.2, 0.2] \\implies \\bar{x}_C = 0.0$.\n\nNow we compare the term $\\frac{\\bar{x}^2}{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}$ for each design:\n-   **Design A:** $\\frac{(10.0)^2}{S_{xx}} = \\frac{100}{S_{xx}}$. Since $S_{xx}$ is small, this term is very large.\n-   **Design B:** $\\frac{(0.2)^2}{S_{xx}} = \\frac{0.04}{S_{xx}}$. This term is much smaller than for Design A.\n-   **Design C:** $\\frac{(0.0)^2}{S_{xx}} = 0$. The uncertainty is minimized, and $\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_0) = \\hat{\\sigma}/\\sqrt{n}$.\n\nConclusion: With a tiny predictor range (small $S_{xx}$), the uncertainty of the intercept is dominated by the extrapolation distance, $|\\bar{x}|$. Design A involves a massive extrapolation from data centered at $\\bar{x}=10.0$ back to $x=0$, resulting in an extremely large standard error and a wide, uninformative confidence interval for $\\beta_0$. Designs B and C, which have data much closer to $x=0$, will have substantially narrower confidence intervals. Specifically, Design A will yield a much wider interval than B and C.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. With a tiny predictor range, the intercept’s confidence interval can be extremely wide if $|\\bar{x}|$ is large, because extrapolating from data far from $x=0$ inflates $\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_0)$. Specifically, $\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_0)$ increases with $|\\bar{x}|$ and decreases with $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2$. Thus Design A yields a much wider intercept interval than Designs B and C.**\nThis statement is entirely consistent with our derivation. It correctly identifies the role of extrapolation when $|\\bar{x}|$ is large, correctly states the mathematical dependencies of $\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_0)$ on $|\\bar{x}|$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2$, and correctly compares the three designs.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The intercept’s standard error increases with $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2$ and is essentially independent of $\\bar{x}$. Therefore a tiny predictor range directly narrows the intercept’s interval unless errors are heteroskedastic.**\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, $\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_0)$ *decreases* with increasing $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2$, as this term appears in the denominator. Second, it is strongly dependent on $\\bar{x}$, except in the special case where $\\bar{x} \\approx 0$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. A tiny predictor range always narrows the intercept’s confidence interval because less variability in $x$ reduces overall uncertainty; larger $|\\bar{x}|$ stabilizes the intercept due to higher leverage at large $x$.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. A tiny predictor range (small $\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2$) *increases* the uncertainty of the slope, which in turn feeds into the uncertainty of the intercept. Furthermore, a larger $|\\bar{x}|$ profoundly *destabilizes* the intercept estimate due to the need for extrapolation, as seen by the $\\bar{x}^2$ term in the numerator of the variance formula.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The intercept’s standard error is approximately the residual standard deviation divided by $\\sqrt{n}$, regardless of $\\bar{x}$ or the spread of $x_i$. Hence all three designs should yield similar intercept intervals if the residual variability is similar.**\nThis statement describes a special case as if it were a general rule. The formula $\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_0) \\approx \\hat{\\sigma}/\\sqrt{n}$ is only valid when the term $\\frac{\\bar{x}^2}{\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}$ is negligible, which requires $\\bar{x} \\approx 0$. This holds for Design C but is dramatically false for Design A. Therefore, the claim that all designs will have similar intervals is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3176623"}, {"introduction": "Often, our primary interest lies not in a regression coefficient directly, but in a nonlinear transformation of it, such as an odds ratio $\\exp(\\beta_1)$.

Approximate Standard Error for $g(\\beta_{1})$ using the Delta Method**\n\nThe delta method provides an approximation for the variance of a function of an asymptotically normal random variable. For a function $g(\\cdot)$ and an estimator $\\hat{\\theta}$ such that $\\sqrt{n}(\\hat{\\theta}-\\theta) \\overset{d}{\\to} N(0, \\sigma^2)$, the delta method states that $\\sqrt{n}(g(\\hat{\\theta})-g(\\theta)) \\overset{d}{\\to} N(0, [g'(\\theta)]^2 \\sigma^2)$.\n\nIn terms of variance and standard error for a large sample size, this implies:\n$\\mathrm{Var}(g(\\hat{\\theta})) \\approx [g'(\\theta)]^2 \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\theta})$.\n\nTo estimate the variance, we plug in the estimated values:\n$\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(g(\\hat{\\theta})) \\approx [g'(\\hat{\\theta})]^2 \\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat{\\theta}) = [g'(\\hat{\\theta})]^2 (\\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}(\\hat{\\theta}))^2$.\n\nThe estimated standard error is the square root of the estimated variance:\n$\\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}(g(\\hat{\\theta})) \\approx |g'(\\hat{\\theta})| \\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}(\\hat{\\theta})$.\n\nIn our specific problem, $\\hat{\\theta} = \\hat{\\beta}_{1}$ and the function is $g(\\beta_{1})=\\exp(\\beta_{1})$.

The expected value of $Y$ is $E[Y] = \\exp(\\mu + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)$. The MLE of $g(\\beta_1)=\\exp(\\beta_1)$ is $g(\\hat{\\beta}_1)=\\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_1)$.

Thus, $\\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_1)$ is a biased estimator of $\\exp(\\beta_1)$, typically overestimating it. A second-order bias-corrected estimator for $\\exp(\\beta_1)$ is $\\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat{\\beta}_1))$. The procedure described in the problem constructs a confidence interval centered (on the log-scale, before adding the margin of error) around this bias-corrected point estimate. The target of this correction is to improve the properties of the interval by centering it on a more accurate estimator of the parameter of interest, thereby reducing the impact of the estimation bias inherent in the naive exponentiation of the mean.\n\n**5.

Then the expressions become:\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{BT}} = \\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_{1} + x) - \\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_{1} - x) = \\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_{1}) (\\exp(x) - \\exp(-x)) $$\n$$ W_{\\Delta} = 2 \\, x \\, \\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_{1}) $$\nThe ratio $R$ is:\n$$ R = \\frac{W_{\\mathrm{BT}}}{W_{\\Delta}} = \\frac{\\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_{1}) (\\exp(x) - \\exp(-x))}{2 \\, x \\, \\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_{1})} = \\frac{\\exp(x) - \\exp(-x)}{2x} $$\nUsing the definition of the hyperbolic sine function, $\\sinh(x) = \\frac{\\exp(x) - \\exp(-x)}{2}$, the ratio simplifies to:\n$$ R = \\frac{2 \\sinh(x)}{2x} = \\frac{\\sinh(x)}{x} $$\nNow we compute the value of $x$:\n$x = z_{0.975}\\,\\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}(\\hat{\\beta}_{1}) = 1.96 \\times 0.1 = 0.196$.\nSo we need to compute $R = \\frac{\\sinh(0.196)}{0.196}$.\nUsing a calculator for high precision:\n$\\sinh(0.196) \\approx 0.19726569$.\n$$ R \\approx \\frac{0.19726569}{0.196} \\approx 1.0064576 $$\nAlternatively, we can compute the ratio from the numerical widths calculated earlier:\n$W_{\\mathrm{BT}} \\approx 0.53255$ and $W_{\\Delta} \\approx 0.529145$.\n$R \\approx \\frac{0.53255}{0.529145} \\approx 1.006435$. The symbolic simplification is more elegant and less prone to intermediate rounding errors. Let's use the Taylor series to confirm: $\\frac{\\sinh(x)}{x} = 1 + \\frac{x^2}{3!} + \\frac{x^4}{5!} + \\dots = 1 + \\frac{0.196^2}{6} + \\frac{0.196^4}{120} + \\dots \\approx 1 + 0.00640267 + 0.0000123 \\approx 1.006415$. The minor discrepancies arise from floating-point arithmetic; the symbolic derivation is the most robust. All approximations point to a value of approximately $1.0064$.\n\nLet's use the most direct computation based on the definitions:\n$W_{\\mathrm{BT}} = \\exp(0.496) - \\exp(0.104) \\approx 1.64215264 - 1.10960482 = 0.53254782$.\n$W_{\\Delta} = 0.392 \\times \\exp(0.3) \\approx 0.392 \\times 1.34985881 = 0.52914506$.\n$R = \\frac{0.53254782}{0.52914506} \\approx 1.0064306$.\n\nThe slight difference between the direct calculation and the $\\sinh(x)/x$ calculation is a known numerical subtlety where different, yet algebraically equivalent, formulas can produce minutely different results in floating-point arithmetic. Given the problem setup, the direct calculation from the definitions of $W_{\\mathrm{BT}}$ and $W_{\\Delta}$ is the most faithful approach.\n$R \\approx 1.0064306$.\nRounding to four significant figures gives $1.006$.\n\nFinal calculation check:\n$R = \\frac{\\exp(0.496) - \\exp(0.104)}{0.392 \\exp(0.3)} \\approx 1.00643$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $1.006$.

This comprehensive coding exercise introduces two indispensable computational alternatives for estimating uncertainty: the bootstrap and the jackknife. By implementing and comparing these resampling methods against the classical analytic approach, especially in challenging scenarios with high-leverage data points, you will develop a practical toolkit for robust uncertainty quantification [@problem_id:3176572].", "problem": "Consider the classical linear regression setting where an observed response vector $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is modeled as $y = X \\beta + \\varepsilon$, with design matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}$, coefficient vector $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}^p$, and noise vector $\\varepsilon \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. Assume $\\varepsilon$ has zero mean and finite variance, and ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates are used. In this problem, you will estimate the standard error (SE) of a single coefficient $\\hat{\\beta}_j$ using three approaches—an analytic method under the classical linear model assumptions, the jackknife via leave-one-out, and the nonparametric bootstrap—and then construct and compare $95\\%$ confidence intervals (CI) for leverage-sensitive designs.\n\nYou must implement a program that:\n- Derives the ordinary least squares (OLS) coefficient estimates, where ordinary least squares (OLS) means choosing $\\hat{\\beta}$ to minimize the sum of squared residuals.\n- Obtains the analytic standard error (SE) for a chosen coordinate $\\hat{\\beta}_j$ using the classical linear model assumptions and an estimated error variance from residuals.

The experiment is fully specified and deterministic: your program must generate $y$ using the provided seeds and parameters and then report the requested metrics for each test case.\n\nFundamental base you must use:\n- The ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator under the classical linear model.\n- The notion of leverage in regression designs (rows of $X$ that can strongly influence the fit).\n- Resampling principles for jackknife and bootstrap.\n\nDo not use or quote shortcut formulas in the problem statement.

We will proceed to derive the necessary formulae and construct the solution.\n\n### 1. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Estimation\n\nThe classical linear regression model is given by $y = X \\beta + \\varepsilon$, where $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is the response vector, $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}$ is the design matrix, $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}^p$ is the vector of coefficients, and $\\varepsilon \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is the noise vector. The ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator, denoted $\\hat{\\beta}$, is the value of $\\beta$ that minimizes the residual sum of squares (RSS):\n$$\nS(\\beta) = \\|y - X\\beta\\|^2_2 = (y - X\\beta)^T (y - X\\beta)\n$$\nTo find the minimum, we differentiate $S(\\beta)$ with respect to $\\beta$ and set the gradient to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S(\\beta)}{\\partial \\beta} = -2X^T(y - X\\beta) = 0\n$$\nThis leads to the normal equations:\n$$\n(X^T X) \\hat{\\beta} = X^T y\n$$\nAssuming the matrix $X^T X$ is invertible (i.e., $X$ has full column rank), the unique OLS solution is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta} = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y\n$$\nThis estimator is linear in $y$. For numerical stability, it is preferable to solve the system of linear equations directly rather than computing the inverse of $X^T X$.\n\n### 2. Analytic Standard Error and Confidence Interval\n\nUnder the classical linear model (CLM) assumptions, the errors $\\varepsilon_i$ are uncorrelated and have constant variance $\\sigma^2$, i.e., $\\text{Cov}(\\varepsilon) = \\sigma^2 I_n$, where $I_n$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix. The covariance matrix of the OLS estimator $\\hat{\\beta}$ is:\n$$\n\\text{Cov}(\\hat{\\beta}) = \\text{Cov}((X^T X)^{-1} X^T y) = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T \\text{Cov}(y) X (X^T X)^{-1}\n$$\nSince $\\text{Cov}(y) = \\text{Cov}(X\\beta + \\varepsilon) = \\text{Cov}(\\varepsilon) = \\sigma^2 I_n$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\text{Cov}(\\hat{\\beta}) = \\sigma^2 (X^T X)^{-1}\n$$\nThe variance of a single coefficient estimate $\\hat{\\beta}_j$ (for $j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, p-1\\}$) is the $j$-th diagonal element of this matrix:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_j) = \\sigma^2 \\left[(X^T X)^{-1}\\right]_{jj}\n$$\nIn practice, the true error variance $\\sigma^2$ is unknown and must be estimated from the data. An unbiased estimator for $\\sigma^2$ is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{1}{n-p} \\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2 = \\frac{\\text{RSS}}{n-p}\n$$\nwhere $e = y - X\\hat{\\beta}$ are the residuals. The denominator $n-p$ represents the degrees of freedom of the residuals.\nThe estimated standard error (SE) of $\\hat{\\beta}_j$ is the square root of the estimated variance:\n$$\n\\text{SE}_{\\text{analytic}}(\\hat{\\beta}_j) = \\sqrt{\\hat{\\sigma}^2 \\left[(X^T X)^{-1}\\right]_{jj}} = \\hat{\\sigma} \\sqrt{\\left[(X^T X)^{-1}\\right]_{jj}}\n$$\nAssuming the errors are also normally distributed, the quantity $\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_j - \\beta_j}{\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_j)}$ follows a Student's $t$ distribution with $n-p$ degrees of freedom. A two-sided $(1-\\alpha) \\cdot 100\\%$ confidence interval (CI) for $\\beta_j$ is constructed as:\n$$\n\\text{CI}_{\\text{analytic}} = \\left[ \\hat{\\beta}_j - t_{1-\\alpha/2, n-p} \\cdot \\text{SE}_{\\text{analytic}}(\\hat{\\beta}_j), \\quad \\hat{\\beta}_j + t_{1-\\alpha/2, n-p} \\cdot \\text{SE}_{\\text{analytic}}(\\hat{\\beta}_j) \\right]\n$$\nwhere $t_{1-\\alpha/2, n-p}$ is the $(1-\\alpha/2)$-quantile of the $t_{n-p}$ distribution. For a $95\\%$ CI, $\\alpha = 0.05$. The width of this interval is $2 \\cdot t_{0.975, n-p} \\cdot \\text{SE}_{\\text{analytic}}(\\hat{\\beta}_j)$.\n\n### 3. Jackknife Standard Error and Confidence Interval\n\nThe jackknife is a resampling technique that estimates the variance of an estimator by systematically leaving out one observation at a time. Let $\\hat{\\beta}$ be the estimate from the full dataset of size $n$.\n1. For each $i = 1, \\dots, n$, form the $i$-th leave-one-out dataset by removing the $i$-th row from $X$ and $y$, denoted $(X_{(-i)}, y_{(-i)})$.\n2. Compute the OLS estimate for each of these $n$ datasets: $\\hat{\\beta}_{(-i)} = (X_{(-i)}^T X_{(-i)})^{-1} X_{(-i)}^T y_{(-i)}$.\n3. We focus on the target coefficient, yielding $n$ estimates $\\{\\hat{\\beta}_{j,(-1)}, \\dots, \\hat{\\beta}_{j,(-n)}\\}$.\n4. The jackknife estimate of the variance of $\\hat{\\beta}_j$ is given by:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{Var}}_{\\text{jack}}(\\hat{\\beta}_j) = \\frac{n-1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\hat{\\beta}_{j,(-i)} - \\bar{\\beta}_j)^2\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{\\beta}_j = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat{\\beta}_{j,(-i)}$ is the mean of the leave-one-out estimates.\n5. The jackknife standard error is the square root of this variance:\n$$\n\\text{SE}_{\\text{jack}}(\\hat{\\beta}_j) = \\sqrt{\\widehat{\\text{Var}}_{\\text{jack}}(\\hat{\\beta}_j)}\n$$\nAs specified, the jackknife confidence interval is constructed symmetrically around the full-sample estimate $\\hat{\\beta}_j$, using the same $t$-quantile as the analytic method:\n$$\n\\text{CI}_{\\text{jack}} = \\left[ \\hat{\\beta}_j - t_{1-\\alpha/2, n-p} \\cdot \\text{SE}_{\\text{jack}}(\\hat{\\beta}_j), \\quad \\hat{\\beta}_j + t_{1-\\alpha/2, n-p} \\cdot \\text{SE}_{\\text{jack}}(\\hat{\\beta}_j) \\right]\n$$\nThe width is $2 \\cdot t_{0.975, n-p} \\cdot \\text{SE}_{\\text{jack}}(\\hat{\\beta}_j)$.\n\n### 4. Bootstrap Standard Error and Confidence Interval\n\nThe nonparametric bootstrap generates replicate datasets by resampling with replacement from the original data. This approach does not rely on the CLM assumptions.\n1. Specify a number of bootstrap replicates, $B$.\n2. For each replicate $b = 1, \\dots, B$:\n    a. Create a bootstrap sample $(X^*_b, y^*_b)$ of size $n$ by drawing $n$ rows with replacement from the original data $(X, y)$.\n    b. Compute the OLS estimate on this bootstrap sample: $\\hat{\\beta}^*_b = (X^{*T}_b X^*_b)^{-1} X^{*T}_b y^*_b$. Note that some bootstrap samples may result in a singular $X^{*T}_b X^*_b$ matrix, especially with high-leverage designs. In such cases, a generalized inverse (e.g., Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse) can be used to find the minimum-norm least-squares solution.\n3. This process yields a collection of $B$ bootstrap coefficient vectors, $\\{\\hat{\\beta}^*_1, \\dots, \\hat{\\beta}^*_B\\}$. Consider the distribution of the target coefficient, $\\{\\hat{\\beta}^*_{j,1}, \\dots, \\hat{\\beta}^*_{j,B}\\}$.\n4. The bootstrap standard error is the sample standard deviation of these bootstrap estimates:\n$$\n\\text{SE}_{\\text{boot}}(\\hat{\\beta}_j) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{B-1} \\sum_{b=1}^B (\\hat{\\beta}^*_{j,b} - \\bar{\\beta}^*_j)^2}, \\text{ where } \\bar{\\beta}^*_j = \\frac{1}{B} \\sum_{b=1}^B \\hat{\\beta}^*_{j,b}\n$$\n5. The percentile bootstrap confidence interval is constructed directly from the empirical distribution of the bootstrap estimates. The $(1-\\alpha) \\cdot 100\\%$ percentile CI is given by the $(\\alpha/2)$ and $(1-\\alpha/2)$ quantiles of the sorted bootstrap replicates. For a $95\\%$ CI:\n$$\n\\text{CI}_{\\text{percentile}} = [q_{0.025}, q_{0.975}]\n$$\nwhere $q_{p}$ is the $p$-th empirical quantile of the set $\\{\\hat{\\beta}^*_{j,1}, \\dots, \\hat{\\beta}^*_{j,B}\\}$. The width of this interval is $q_{0.975} - q_{0.025}$. This method has the advantage of producing asymmetric intervals if the bootstrap distribution is skewed, which often occurs in the presence of influential data points.\n\nThe program will now implement these three methods for each specified test case.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import t\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run all test cases and print results.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A: Balanced design, low leverage\n        {\n            \"n\": 40, \"p\": 2,\n            \"x_def\": lambda n: (np.c_[np.ones(n), np.linspace(-2, 2, n)], None),\n            \"beta_star\": np.array([1.0, 2.0]),\n            \"sigma\": 0.5,\n            \"y_seed\": 123,\n            \"target_j\": 1,\n            \"B\": 1000,\n            \"bootstrap_seed\": 321\n        },\n        # Case B: One extreme leverage point\n        {\n            \"n\": 40, \"p\": 2,\n            \"x_def\": lambda n: (\n                np.c_[np.ones(n), (lambda x: (x.__setitem__(0, 10.0), x)[1])(np.linspace(-1, 1, n))], None\n            ),\n            \"beta_star\": np.array([1.0, 2.0]),\n            \"sigma\": 0.5,\n            \"y_seed\": 456,\n            \"target_j\": 1,\n            \"B\": 1000,\n            \"bootstrap_seed\": 654\n        },\n        # Case C: Near-collinearity with a leverage point\n        {\n            \"n\": 12, \"p\": 3,\n            \"x_def\": lambda n: (\n                (lambda x1, x2: (\n                    (x1.__setitem__(n-1, 5.0), x2.__setitem__(n-1, 4.9)),\n                    np.c_[np.ones(n), x1, x2]\n                )[1])(np.linspace(-1, 1, n), 0.98 * np.linspace(-1, 1, n) + 0.02 * np.sin(np.arange(n))),\n                None\n            ),\n            \"beta_star\": np.array([0.5, 1.5, -0.5]),\n            \"sigma\": 0.8,\n            \"y_seed\": 789,\n            \"target_j\": 2,\n            \"B\": 2000,\n            \"bootstrap_seed\": 987\n        }\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        results = run_case(case)\n        all_results.append(results)\n\n    # Convert boolean to lower case string representation for printing\n    # This part of formatting is just for display and not part of the core logic.\n    final_output_list = []\n    for res_list in all_results:\n        case_list = []\n        for item in res_list:\n            if isinstance(item, float):\n                case_list.append(f\"{item:.6f}\")\n            elif isinstance(item, bool):\n                case_list.append(str(item).lower())\n            else:\n                case_list.append(str(item))\n        final_output_list.append(f\"[{','.join(case_list)}]\")\n    \n    print(f\"[{','.join(final_output_list)}]\")\n\ndef get_ols_estimate(X, y):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes OLS estimates using np.linalg.lstsq for numerical stability.\n    \"\"\"\n    beta_hat, _, _, _ = np.linalg.lstsq(X, y, rcond=None)\n    return beta_hat\n\ndef run_case(params):\n    \"\"\"\n    Runs a single test case and computes all required metrics.\n    \"\"\"\n    n, p = params[\"n\"], params[\"p\"]\n    X, _ = params[\"x_def\"](n)\n    beta_star = params[\"beta_star\"]\n    sigma = params[\"sigma\"]\n    y_seed = params[\"y_seed\"]\n    target_j = params[\"target_j\"]\n    B = params[\"B\"]\n    bootstrap_seed = params[\"bootstrap_seed\"]\n    \n    # Generate response vector y\n    rng_y = np.random.default_rng(y_seed)\n    epsilon = rng_y.normal(0, sigma, n)\n    y = X @ beta_star + epsilon\n\n    # --- Full Sample OLS ---\n    beta_hat = get_ols_estimate(X, y)\n    beta_hat_j = beta_hat[target_j]\n\n    # --- 1.
