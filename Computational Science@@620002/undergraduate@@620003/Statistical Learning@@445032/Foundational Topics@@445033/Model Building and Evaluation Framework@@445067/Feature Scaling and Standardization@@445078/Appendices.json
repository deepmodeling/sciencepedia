Your task is to implement and compare three feature scaling strategies from first principles and quantify how much each strategy preserves the spread of the central mass after scaling.\n\nUse the following definitions as the fundamental base:\n- Given a vector of real numbers $x = (x_1,\\dots,x_n)$, the min-max scaling of $x$ to the interval $[0,1]$ is the transformation $s(x_i) = \\dfrac{x_i - \\min(x)}{\\max(x) - \\min(x)}$. If $\\max(x) = \\min(x)$, define $s(x_i) = 0$ for all $i$ (constant-feature rule).\n- For any $p \\in (0,1)$, the $p$-quantile $Q_p(x)$ of $x$ is the value at cumulative proportion $p$ under a standard piecewise-linear interpolation of order statistics. In code, you must use the linear interpolation method for sample quantiles.\n- Winsorization at lower and upper proportions $p_{\\ell}$ and $p_u$ replaces values below $Q_{p_{\\ell}}(x)$ by $Q_{p_{\\ell}}(x)$ and values above $Q_{p_u}(x)$ by $Q_{p_u}(x)$. Denote the winsorized vector by $w(x)$. Then define the winsorized scaling to $[0,1]$ by $s_{\\mathrm{win}}(x_i) = \\dfrac{w(x_i) - Q_{p_{\\ell}}(x)}{Q_{p_u}(x) - Q_{p_{\\ell}}(x)}$, with the constant-feature rule if $Q_{p_u}(x) = Q_{p_{\\ell}}(x)$.\n- Fixed clipping at bounds $L$ and $U$ replaces values below $L$ by $L$ and values above $U$ by $U$, producing a clipped vector $c(x)$. Then define clipped min-max scaling by $s_{\\mathrm{clip}}(x_i) = \\dfrac{c(x_i) - \\min(c(x))}{\\max(c(x)) - \\min(c(x))}$, with the constant-feature rule if $\\max(c(x)) = \\min(c(x))$.\n\nTo quantify the preservation of central spread after scaling, compute the central width at level $\\alpha \\in (0,0.5)$ as\n$$\nW_{\\alpha}(y) = Q_{1-\\alpha}(y) - Q_{\\alpha}(y),\n$$\nwhere $y$ is the scaled vector and $Q_{p}$ uses the same linear interpolation method as above.

A step-by-step solution will be provided.\n\n### Principle-Based Design\nThe solution will be developed by first establishing the fundamental building blocks as defined in the problem, then composing them to implement the three distinct scaling strategies. The core components are:\n\n1.  **Quantile Calculation**: The foundation of the analysis is the quantile function, $Q_p(x)$, which must use linear interpolation. We will use a standard library function that implements this method.\n2.  **Scaling Function**: A general scaling function will be created to perform the transformation $y \\mapsto \\frac{y - y_{\\min}}{y_{\\max} - y_{\\min}}$. This function will incorporate the \"constant-feature rule,\" returning zeros if $y_{\\min} = y_{\\max}$, to prevent division by zero and adhere to the problem specification.\n3.  **Scaling Strategies**: Each of the three scaling strategies (min-max, winsorized, and clipped) will be implemented as a separate procedure.\n    -   **Min-Max Scaling**: Directly applies the scaling function to the original data vector $x$, using $\\min(x)$ and $\\max(x)$ as the bounds.\n    -   **Winsorized Scaling**: First, it computes the $p_{\\ell}$ and $p_{u}$ quantiles of the data. These quantiles are used to \"winsorize\" the data vector $x$, creating a new vector $w(x)$ where extreme values are replaced by the quantile values. The scaling function is then applied to $w(x)$ using the quantiles $Q_{p_{\\ell}}(x)$ and $Q_{p_u}(x)$ as the bounds.\n    -   **Clipped Scaling**: First, it \"clips\" the data vector $x$ at the fixed lower and upper bounds $L$ and $U$, creating a new vector $c(x)$. The scaling function is then applied to $c(x)$ using its own minimum and maximum values, $\\min(c(x))$ and $\\max(c(x))$, as the bounds.\n4.  **Central Width Metric**: A function will implement the central width calculation, $W_{\\alpha}(y) = Q_{1-\\alpha}(y) - Q_{\\alpha}(y)$, using the same quantile method.\n\nThe main logic will iterate through the provided test cases. For each case, it will apply the three scaling strategies to the dataset and then compute the central width $W_{\\alpha}$ for each of the three resulting scaled vectors. The results will be collected, rounded, and formatted as specified.\n\n### Algorithmic Steps for a Single Case\n\nLet the input be the data vector $x$ and parameters $p_{\\ell}$, $p_u$, $L$, $U$, $\\alpha$.\n\n1.  **For Min-Max Scaling**:\n    a. Let $x_{\\min} = \\min(x)$ and $x_{\\max} = \\max(x)$.\n    b. If $x_{\\max} = x_{\\min}$, $y_{\\text{mm}} = \\vec{0}$. Otherwise, $y_{\\text{mm}} = \\frac{x - x_{\\min}}{x_{\\max} - x_{\\min}}$.\n    c. Compute $W_1 = Q_{1-\\alpha}(y_{\\text{mm}}) - Q_{\\alpha}(y_{\\text{mm}})$.\n\n2.  **For Winsorized Scaling**:\n    a. Compute the quantiles $q_{\\ell} = Q_{p_{\\ell}}(x)$ and $q_u = Q_{p_u}(x)$.\n    b. Create the winsorized vector $w(x)$ by replacing elements of $x$ less than $q_{\\ell}$ with $q_{\\ell}$ and elements greater than $q_u$ with $q_u$.\n    c. If $q_u = q_{\\ell}$, $y_{\\text{win}} = \\vec{0}$. Otherwise, $y_{\\text{win}} = \\frac{w(x) - q_{\\ell}}{q_u - q_{\\ell}}$.\n    d. Compute $W_2 = Q_{1-\\alpha}(y_{\\text{win}}) - Q_{\\alpha}(y_{\\text{win}})$.\n\n3.  **For Fixed Clipping Scaling**:\n    a. Create the clipped vector $c(x)$ by replacing elements of $x$ less than $L$ with $L$ and elements greater than $U$ with $U$.\n    b. Let $c_{\\min} = \\min(c(x))$ and $c_{\\max} = \\max(c(x))$.\n    c. If $c_{\\max} = c_{\\min}$, $y_{\\text{clip}} = \\vec{0}$. Otherwise, $y_{\\text{clip}} = \\frac{c(x) - c_{\\min}}{c_{\\max} - c_{\\min}}$.\n    d. Compute $W_3 = Q_{1-\\alpha}(y_{\\text{clip}}) - Q_{\\alpha}(y_{\\text{clip}})$.\n\n4.  **Return**: The rounded values $[W_1, W_2, W_3]$.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements and compares three feature scaling strategies by quantifying\n    the preservation of central data spread.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"x\": np.array([-100.0, -5.0, -4.0, -3.0, -2.0, -1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 100.0]),\n            \"p_l\": 0.05, \"p_u\": 0.95,\n            \"L\": -10.0, \"U\": 10.0,\n            \"alpha\": 0.1\n        },\n        {\n            \"x\": np.array([-5.0, -4.0, -3.0, -2.0, -1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]),\n            \"p_l\": 0.05, \"p_u\": 0.95,\n            \"L\": -10.0, \"U\": 10.0,\n            \"alpha\": 0.1\n        },\n        {\n            \"x\": np.array([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 100.0]),\n            \"p_l\": 0.05, \"p_u\": 0.95,\n            \"L\": -10.0, \"U\": 10.0,\n            \"alpha\": 0.1\n        },\n        {\n            \"x\": np.array([5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 50.0]),\n            \"p_l\": 0.05, \"p_u\": 0.95,\n            \"L\": -10.0, \"U\": 10.0,\n            \"alpha\": 0.1\n        }\n    ]\n\n    def get_quantile(data, p):\n        \"\"\"Computes quantile using linear interpolation.\"\"\"\n        # numpy.quantile's 'linear' method is the required one.\n        return np.quantile(data, p, method='linear')\n\n    def scale_data(data, low_bound, high_bound):\n        \"\"\"\n        Scales data to [0, 1] using specified bounds, with constant-feature rule.\n        \"\"\"\n        denominator = high_bound - low_bound\n        if np.isclose(denominator, 0):\n            return np.zeros_like(data, dtype=float)\n        return (data - low_bound) / denominator\n\n    def calculate_central_width(scaled_data, alpha):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the central width W_alpha for a scaled vector.\n        \"\"\"\n        q_low = get_quantile(scaled_data, alpha)\n        q_high = get_quantile(scaled_data, 1 - alpha)\n        return q_high - q_low\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        x = case[\"x\"]\n        p_l, p_u = case[\"p_l\"], case[\"p_u\"]\n        L, U = case[\"L\"], case[\"U\"]\n        alpha = case[\"alpha\"]\n\n        # 1.

This exercise [@problem_id:3121571] explores how different preprocessing techniques, including Z-score standardization and min-max scaling, handle these constant features. By implementing these methods from first principles, you will gain insight into potential numerical instabilities and see how a feature-wise constant can gain variance after a sample-wise normalization, a subtle but important distinction in practice.", "problem": "You are to write a complete, runnable program that constructs specific datasets containing zero-variance features and analyzes how different scaling and normalization procedures handle those features. Your program must be entirely self-contained and produce the required single-line output. The analysis will include a downstream check that models expecting nonzero feature variance would pass or fail.\n\nStart from the following fundamental base in probability and linear algebra:\n- The sample mean of a feature dimension is defined by $\\,\\mu_j = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{ij}\\,$ for $\\,j \\in \\{1,\\dots,d\\}\\,$ and $\\,n\\,$ samples in $\\,d\\,$ dimensions.\n- The population variance of a feature dimension is defined by $\\,\\sigma_j^2 = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{ij}-\\mu_j)^2\\,$ (denominator $\\,n\\,$).\n- The standard deviation is $\\,\\sigma_j = \\sqrt{\\sigma_j^2}\\,$.\n- The minimum and maximum of a feature are $\\,\\min_j = \\min_i x_{ij}\\,$ and $\\,\\max_j = \\max_i x_{ij}\\,$.\n- The maximum absolute value of a feature is $\\,m^{\\star}_j = \\max_i |x_{ij}|\\,$.\n- The Euclidean norm of a sample vector $\\,\\mathbf{x}_i\\,$ is $\\,\\lVert \\mathbf{x}_i \\rVert_2 = \\sqrt{\\sum_{j=1}^{d} x_{ij}^2}\\,$.\n\nUsing only these definitions, implement the following four transformations on a dataset $\\,X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}\\,$:\n1. Z-score standardization: center each feature by its mean and scale by its standard deviation.\n2. Min-max scaling to the interval $[0,1]$: shift and scale each feature using its minimum and maximum.\n3. Max-absolute-value scaling: scale each feature by its maximum absolute value so that the transformed feature lies in $[-1,1]$.\n4. Row-wise $\\ell_2$ normalization: scale each sample vector $\\,\\mathbf{x}_i\\,$ to have $\\,\\lVert \\mathbf{x}_i \\rVert_2 = 1\\,$ when possible.\n\nIn all cases where a division by zero would occur due to a zero-variance feature or zero range or zero norm, your implementation must avoid non-finite arithmetic in the transformation itself by following this practical convention: treat the divisor as $\\,1\\,$ for the purpose of computing the transformed values. Note that this convention will map a feature that is constant across all samples to a constant in the transformed data as well, which is consistent for affine per-feature scalers, while row-wise normalization may change a constant feature’s variability depending on whether the row norms vary.\n\nDownstream check to emulate a model expecting nonzero feature variance:\n- For a transformed dataset $\\,Y\\,$ with per-feature variances $\\,\\sigma_j^2(Y)\\,$ and mean $\\,\\mu_j(Y)\\,$, define the standardized Euclidean distance of each sample to the mean by\n$$\nd_i^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\frac{\\left(Y_{ij}-\\mu_j(Y)\\right)^2}{\\sigma_j^2(Y)} \\, .\n$$\n- If any $\\,\\sigma_j^2(Y) = 0\\,$, the model’s computation requires division by zero. For this problem, you must detect this and report that the distances are not finite for that transformation. Your program must explicitly compute the distances using the above expression and then report whether all distances are finite.\n\nTest suite. Your program must evaluate the four transformations on the following three datasets:\n- Dataset A ($n=5$, $d=2$): rows are $[5,0], [5,1], [5,2], [5,3], [5,4]$. The first feature has zero variance; the second varies.\n- Dataset B ($n=3$, $d=2$): rows are $[2,2], [2,2], [2,2]$. All features have zero variance.\n- Dataset C ($n=4$, $d=3$): rows are $[1.0,0,7], [1.0,10,7], [1.0,20,7], [1.001,30,7]$. The first feature has very small variance, the second varies widely, and the third feature is constant nonzero.\n\nFor each dataset and each transformation, compute:\n- The list of per-feature variances of the transformed data, as floating-point numbers.\n- A boolean indicating whether all per-feature variances are strictly greater than $\\,0\\,$.\n- A boolean indicating whether all standardized Euclidean distances to the transformed-data mean are finite.\n\nFinal output format. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. The outer list corresponds to the three datasets in the order A, B, C.

The task is to analyze the behavior of four standard feature scaling methods when applied to datasets containing features with zero or near-zero variance.\n\nThe foundation of this analysis rests on fundamental statistical definitions. For a given dataset $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ with $n$ samples and $d$ features, we define:\n- The sample mean of the $j$-th feature: $\\mu_j = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{ij}$\n- The population variance of the $j$-th feature: $\\sigma_j^2 = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{ij}-\\mu_j)^2$\n- The standard deviation of the $j$-th feature: $\\sigma_j = \\sqrt{\\sigma_j^2}$\n\nWe will implement and analyze four transformations:\n\n1.  **Z-score Standardization**: This transformation centers each feature to have a mean of $0$ and scales it to have a standard deviation of $1$. The formula for the transformed feature $Y_j$ is:\n    $$ Y_j = \\frac{X_j - \\mu_j}{\\sigma_j} $$\n    For a feature with zero variance ($\\sigma_j = 0$), the scaling is ill-defined. The problem specifies a convention: if the divisor is $0$, it should be treated as $1$. Thus, for a constant feature $X_j$, where $\\sigma_j=0$, the transformation becomes $Y_j = X_j - \\mu_j$. Since $X_j$ is constant, all its elements are equal to $\\mu_j$, so $Y_j$ becomes a vector of zeros. The variance of the transformed feature will thus be $0$.\n\n2.  **Min-Max Scaling**: This method scales features to a fixed range, typically $[0, 1]$. The transformation is:\n    $$ Y_j = \\frac{X_j - \\min_j}{\\max_j - \\min_j} $$\n    where $\\min_j = \\min_i x_{ij}$ and $\\max_j = \\max_i x_{ij}$. The term $\\max_j - \\min_j$ is the range of the feature. If a feature is constant, its range is $0$, leading to division by zero. Applying the specified convention, the divisor is replaced by $1$. For a constant feature, $X_j - \\min_j$ is a vector of zeros, so the transformed feature $Y_j$ is also a vector of zeros, having a variance of $0$.\n\n3.  **Max-Absolute-Value Scaling**: This technique scales each feature by its maximum absolute value, $m^{\\star}_j = \\max_i |x_{ij}|$. The transformed data lies in $[-1, 1]$.\n    $$ Y_j = \\frac{X_j}{m^{\\star}_j} $$\n    If a feature consists entirely of zeros, its $m^{\\star}_j$ is $0$. Applying the convention, the division is by $1$, and the feature remains a vector of zeros. If a feature is a non-zero constant, say $c$, then $m^{\\star}_j = |c|$ and the transformed feature becomes a constant vector of `sign(c)`, which also has zero variance.\n\n4.  **Row-wise $\\ell_2$ Normalization**: Unlike the previous methods, this one operates on samples (rows) instead of features (columns). Each sample vector $\\mathbf{x}_i$ is scaled to have a unit Euclidean norm ($\\lVert \\mathbf{x}_i \\rVert_2 = 1$).\n    $$ \\mathbf{y}_i = \\frac{\\mathbf{x}_i}{\\lVert \\mathbf{x}_i \\rVert_2} = \\frac{\\mathbf{x}_i}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{j=1}^{d} x_{ij}^2}} $$\n    If a sample vector is the zero vector, its norm is $0$. The convention treats the divisor as $1$, so the zero vector remains unchanged. A key distinction of this method is that it can induce variance in a feature that was originally constant. If a feature $X_j$ is constant ($x_{ij} = c$ for all $i$), but the row norms $\\lVert \\mathbf{x}_i \\rVert_2$ vary across samples, the transformed feature values $y_{ij} = c / \\lVert \\mathbf{x}_i \\rVert_2$ will also vary. Consequently, the transformed feature will have non-zero variance.\n\nThe downstream check involves computing the squared standardized Euclidean distance for each transformed sample $\\mathbf{y}_i$ to the mean of the transformed data $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(Y)$:\n$$ d_i^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\frac{\\left(Y_{ij}-\\mu_j(Y)\\right)^2}{\\sigma_j^2(Y)} $$\nThis computation is only possible if all feature variances $\\sigma_j^2(Y)$ are strictly positive. If any $\\sigma_j^2(Y) = 0$, the corresponding feature column $Y_j$ is constant and equal to its mean $\\mu_j(Y)$. The term for that feature becomes $\\frac{0}{0}$, which is undefined (resulting in `NaN` in floating-point arithmetic). Therefore, the distances are considered \"not finite\" if and only if at least one feature in the transformed data has zero variance. The boolean check for `all_distances_finite` is thus equivalent to the check for `all_positive_variance`.\n\nThe program will be structured to systematically apply each of the four transformations to the three specified datasets (A, B, C), and for each resulting transformed dataset, it will compute the list of per-feature variances, a boolean indicating if all variances are positive, and a boolean indicating if the standardized distances are finite.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nimport json\n\n# No other libraries are permitted, scipy is allowed but not used.\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to define datasets, apply transformations, analyze results,\n    and print the output in the required format.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = {\n        \"A\": np.array([[5.0, 0.0], [5.0, 1.0], [5.0, 2.0], [5.0, 3.0], [5.0, 4.0]]),\n        \"B\": np.array([[2.0, 2.0], [2.0, 2.0], [2.0, 2.0]]),\n        \"C\": np.array([[1.0, 0.0, 7.0], [1.0, 10.0, 7.0], [1.0, 20.0, 7.0], [1.001, 30.0, 7.0]])\n    }\n    \n    datasets_order = [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"]\n\n    # Transformation functions\n    def z_score_standardization(X):\n        mean = np.mean(X, axis=0)\n        # Population standard deviation (ddof=0 is default)\n        std_dev = np.std(X, axis=0)\n        # Apply convention: if std_dev is 0, divisor is 1.\n        divisors = np.where(std_dev == 0, 1.0, std_dev)\n        return (X - mean) / divisors\n\n    def min_max_scaling(X):\n        min_vals = np.min(X, axis=0)\n        max_vals = np.max(X, axis=0)\n        data_range = max_vals - min_vals\n        # Apply convention: if range is 0, divisor is 1.\n        divisors = np.where(data_range == 0, 1.0, data_range)\n        return (X - min_vals) / divisors\n\n    def max_abs_scaling(X):\n        max_abs_vals = np.max(np.abs(X), axis=0)\n        # Apply convention: if max_abs is 0, divisor is 1.\n        divisors = np.where(max_abs_vals == 0, 1.0, max_abs_vals)\n        return X / divisors\n\n    def l2_normalization(X):\n        # ord=2 for Euclidean norm\n        norms = np.linalg.norm(X, axis=1, ord=2)\n        # Apply convention: if norm is 0, divisor is 1.\n        divisors = np.where(norms == 0, 1.0, norms)\n        # Use np.newaxis for correct broadcasting (n, d) / (n, 1)\n        return X / divisors[:, np.newaxis]\n\n    transformation_funcs = [\n        z_score_standardization,\n        min_max_scaling,\n        max_abs_scaling,\n        l2_normalization\n    ]\n\n    def analyze_transformation(Y):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the required metrics for a transformed dataset Y.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Per-feature population variances (ddof=0 is default)\n        variances = np.var(Y, axis=0)\n        \n        # Check if all variances are strictly greater than 0\n        all_positive_variance = np.all(variances > 0)\n        \n        # The standardized Euclidean distances are finite if and only if all\n        # feature variances are non-zero.\n        all_distances_finite = all_positive_variance\n        \n        return [variances.tolist(), bool(all_positive_variance), bool(all_distances_finite)]\n    \n    # Main processing loop\n    all_results = []\n    for dataset_key in datasets_order:\n        X = test_cases[dataset_key]\n        dataset_results = []\n        for func in transformation_funcs:\n            Y = func(X)\n            analysis = analyze_transformation(Y)\n            dataset_results.append(analysis)\n        all_results.append(dataset_results)\n    \n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # We use json.dumps to get a compact representation and then\n    # replace 'true'/'false' with Python's 'True'/'False'.\n    output_str = json.dumps(all_results, separators=(',', ':'))\n    output_str = output_str.replace('true', 'True').replace('false', 'False')\n    print(output_str)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3121571"}, {"introduction": "Feature scaling is not merely a preliminary data cleaning step; it is deeply intertwined with the behavior of many machine learning models, especially regularized models like Ridge and LASSO where the penalty is applied to the coefficients.

Use only the following foundational base:\n\n- The empirical risk for linear prediction given a design matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ and response vector $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is $R(w) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|y - Xw\\|_2^2$.\n- The $L_1$ norm is $\\|w\\|_1 = \\sum_{j=1}^d |w_j|$.\n- The $L_2$ norm is $\\|w\\|_2 = \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^d w_j^2\\right)^{1/2}$.\n\nYou must derive from these bases the estimators obtained by adding either an $L_1$ or $L_2$ penalty to the empirical risk, and then use those estimators to compute numerical results for a carefully chosen orthogonal design where the effect of scaling can be seen cleanly.

General Solution for Orthogonal Designs**\n\nWe are given the empirical risk for a linear model as $R(w) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|y - Xw\\|_2^2$. Let the design matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ have orthogonal columns $c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_d$, such that $c_i^\\top c_j = 0$ for $i \\neq j$. The term $Xw$ can be expressed as a linear combination of these columns: $Xw = \\sum_{j=1}^d w_j c_j$.\n\nThe empirical risk term can be expanded as:\n$$ \\|y - Xw\\|_2^2 = \\left(y - \\sum_{j=1}^d w_j c_j\\right)^\\top \\left(y - \\sum_{j=1}^d w_j c_j\\right) $$\n$$ = y^\\top y - 2 \\sum_{j=1}^d w_j (y^\\top c_j) + \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^d w_j c_j\\right)^\\top \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^d w_k c_k\\right) $$\nUsing the orthogonality property $c_j^\\top c_k = \\delta_{jk} \\|c_j\\|_2^2$, where $\\delta_{jk}$ is the Kronecker delta, the cross-term simplifies:\n$$ = y^\\top y - 2 \\sum_{j=1}^d w_j (y^\\top c_j) + \\sum_{j=1}^d w_j^2 \\|c_j\\|_2^2 $$\nThis expression is separable with respect to the coefficients $w_j$. We can complete the square for each $w_j$:\n$$ = \\sum_{j=1}^d \\left(w_j^2 \\|c_j\\|_2^2 - 2 w_j (y^\\top c_j)\\right) + y^\\top y $$\n$$ = \\sum_{j=1}^d \\|c_j\\|_2^2 \\left(w_j^2 - 2 w_j \\frac{y^\\top c_j}{\\|c_j\\|_2^2}\\right) + y^\\top y $$\nLet $\\hat{w}_j^{\\text{OLS}} = \\frac{y^\\top c_j}{\\|c_j\\|_2^2}$ be the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimate for the $j$-th coefficient. The expression becomes:\n$$ \\|y - Xw\\|_2^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^d \\|c_j\\|_2^2 (w_j - \\hat{w}_j^{\\text{OLS}})^2 - \\sum_{j=1}^d \\|c_j\\|_2^2 (\\hat{w}_j^{\\text{OLS}})^2 + y^\\top y $$\nSince the last two terms are constant with respect to $w$, minimizing $\\|y - Xw\\|_2^2$ is equivalent to minimizing $\\sum_{j=1}^d \\|c_j\\|_2^2(w_j - \\hat{w}_j^{\\text{OLS}})^2$.\n\nBecause both the Ridge ($L_2$) and LASSO ($L_1$) penalties are also separable, i.e., $\\|w\\|_2^2 = \\sum_j w_j^2$ and $\\|w\\|_1 = \\sum_j |w_j|$, the full regularized objective functions decouple into $d$ independent one-dimensional optimization problems.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Ridge Estimator ($w^{(2)}$)**\n\nThe Ridge objective function is $J_2(w) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|y - Xw\\|_2^2 + \\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\|w\\|_2^2$. For an orthogonal design, we can find the optimal $w_j$ by solving:\n$$ \\min_{w_j} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{2} \\|c_j\\|_2^2 (w_j - \\hat{w}_j^{\\text{OLS}})^2 + \\frac{\\lambda}{2} w_j^2 \\right\\} $$\nThis is a convex and differentiable function of $w_j$. Setting the derivative with respect to $w_j$ to zero yields the minimum:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w_j} J_2 = \\|c_j\\|_2^2 (w_j - \\hat{w}_j^{\\text{OLS}}) + \\lambda w_j = 0 $$\n$$ w_j (\\|c_j\\|_2^2 + \\lambda) = \\|c_j\\|_2^2 \\hat{w}_j^{\\text{OLS}} $$\n$$ w_j^{(2)} = \\frac{\\|c_j\\|_2^2}{\\|c_j\\|_2^2 + \\lambda} \\hat{w}_j^{\\text{OLS}} $$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\hat{w}_j^{\\text{OLS}}$, we get the closed form for the Ridge coefficient:\n$$ w_j^{(2)} = \\frac{\\|c_j\\|_2^2}{\\|c_j\\|_2^2 + \\lambda} \\left(\\frac{y^\\top c_j}{\\|c_j\\|_2^2}\\right) = \\frac{y^\\top c_j}{\\|c_j\\|_2^2 + \\lambda} $$\n\n**3.

We use subgradient calculus. The subgradient of the objective with respect to $w_j$ must contain $0$ at the minimum. The subgradient $\\partial |\\cdot|$ at a point $z$ is $\\text{sgn}(z)$ if $z \\neq 0$ and the interval $[-1, 1]$ if $z=0$.\nThe subgradient condition is:\n$$ 0 \\in \\|c_j\\|_2^2 (w_j - \\hat{w}_j^{\\text{OLS}}) + \\lambda \\, \\partial |w_j| $$\n- If $w_j > 0$: $\\|c_j\\|_2^2 (w_j - \\hat{w}_j^{\\text{OLS}}) + \\lambda = 0 \\implies w_j = \\hat{w}_j^{\\text{OLS}} - \\frac{\\lambda}{\\|c_j\\|_2^2}$. This holds if $\\hat{w}_j^{\\text{OLS}} > \\frac{\\lambda}{\\|c_j\\|_2^2}$.\n- If $w_j < 0$: $\\|c_j\\|_2^2 (w_j - \\hat{w}_j^{\\text{OLS}}) - \\lambda = 0 \\implies w_j = \\hat{w}_j^{\\text{OLS}} + \\frac{\\lambda}{\\|c_j\\|_2^2}$. This holds if $\\hat{w}_j^{\\text{OLS}} < -\\frac{\\lambda}{\\|c_j\\|_2^2}$.\n- If $w_j = 0$: $0 \\in -\\|c_j\\|_2^2 \\hat{w}_j^{\\text{OLS}} + [-\\lambda, \\lambda] \\implies | \\hat{w}_j^{\\text{OLS}} | \\le \\frac{\\lambda}{\\|c_j\\|_2^2}$.\n\nThese three cases define the soft-thresholding operator $S(z, \\gamma) = \\text{sgn}(z) (|z|-\\gamma)_+$, where $(\\cdot)_+ = \\max(\\cdot, 0)$. The solution is:\n$$ w_j^{(1)} = S\\left(\\hat{w}_j^{\\text{OLS}}, \\frac{\\lambda}{\\|c_j\\|_2^2}\\right) = \\text{sgn}(\\hat{w}_j^{\\text{OLS}}) \\left(|\\hat{w}_j^{\\text{OLS}}| - \\frac{\\lambda}{\\|c_j\\|_2^2}\\right)_+ $$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\hat{w}_j^{\\text{OLS}}$:\n$$ w_j^{(1)} = \\text{sgn}\\left(\\frac{y^\\top c_j}{\\|c_j\\|_2^2}\\right) \\left(\\left|\\frac{y^\\top c_j}{\\|c_j\\|_2^2}\\right| - \\frac{\\lambda}{\\|c_j\\|_2^2}\\right)_+ = \\frac{1}{\\|c_j\\|_2^2} \\text{sgn}(y^\\top c_j) (|y^\\top c_j| - \\lambda)_+ $$\n\n**4. Application to the Specific Problem**\n\nWe are given $n=4, d=2$, $\\lambda=0.7$, $y = [1, 0.3, 0, 0]^\\top$, and a scaled design matrix $X(\\alpha) = [\\alpha x_1, x_2]$ where $x_1 = [1, 0, 0, 0]^\\top$ and $x_2 = [0, 1, 0, 0]^\\top$. We need to find the first coefficient, $w_1$, corresponding to the first column $c_1 = \\alpha x_1 = [\\alpha, 0, 0, 0]^\\top$.\n\nFirst, let's compute the necessary quantities for $j=1$:\n- The squared $L_2$ norm of the first column: $\\|c_1\\|_2^2 = (\\alpha x_1)^\\top(\\alpha x_1) = \\alpha^2 \\|x_1\\|_2^2 = \\alpha^2(1^2) = \\alpha^2$.\n- The inner product of $y$ with the first column: $y^\\top c_1 = y^\\top(\\alpha x_1) = \\alpha(y^\\top x_1) = \\alpha([1, 0.3, 0, 0][1, 0, 0, 0]^\\top) = \\alpha(1) = \\alpha$.\n\nNow we substitute these into our derived formulas for $w_1^{(2)}(\\alpha)$ and $w_1^{(1)}(\\alpha)$:\n\n- **Ridge Coefficient $w_1^{(2)}(\\alpha)$**:\n  $$ w_1^{(2)}(\\alpha) = \\frac{y^\\top c_1}{\\|c_1\\|_2^2 + \\lambda} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha^2 + 0.7} $$\n\n- **LASSO Coefficient $w_1^{(1)}(\\alpha)$**:\n  Since $\\alpha > 0$, $y^\\top c_1 = \\alpha > 0$, so $\\text{sgn}(y^\\top c_1) = 1$.\n  $$ w_1^{(1)}(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{\\|c_1\\|_2^2} (|y^\\top c_1| - \\lambda)_+ = \\frac{1}{\\alpha^2} (|\\alpha| - 0.7)_+ = \\frac{(\\alpha - 0.7)_+}{\\alpha^2} $$\n  This explicit form reveals the thresholding behavior. If $\\alpha \\le 0.7$, $w_1^{(1)}(\\alpha) = 0$. If $\\alpha > 0.7$, $w_1^{(1)}(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\alpha - 0.7}{\\alpha^2}$.\n\n**Conclusion on Sensitivity to Scaling**\n\nThe LASSO solution is highly sensitive to the scaling factor $\\alpha$. The condition for the coefficient $w_1$ to be non-zero is $|y^\\top c_1| > \\lambda$, which translates to $\\alpha > 0.7$. The term $y^\\top c_1$ is directly proportional to $\\alpha$. Scaling the feature column down (reducing $\\alpha$) can cause its coefficient to be set exactly to zero. This is a form of automatic feature selection.\n\nIn contrast, the Ridge solution $w_1^{(2)}(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha^2 + 0.7}$ is a smooth function of $\\alpha$. While its value changes with $\\alpha$, it will only be zero if $\\alpha=0$. For any finite $\\lambda > 0$ and any scaling $\\alpha > 0$, the coefficient is non-zero. It shrinks towards zero but is never exactly zeroed out. This demonstrates that LASSO is more sensitive to feature scaling, as scaling can fundamentally change the model structure (by including or excluding a feature), whereas for Ridge it only changes the magnitude of the coefficients smoothly.\n\nThe program below will compute the numerical values for the specified test suite of $\\alpha$ values based on these derived formulas.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes LASSO and Ridge coefficients for a scaled orthogonal design\n    to demonstrate sensitivity to feature scaling.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the test cases and parameters from the problem statement.\n    test_alphas = [0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 5.0]\n    lambda_val = 0.7\n\n    results = []\n    for alpha in test_alphas:\n        # The formulas for the coefficients are derived from first principles\n        # for an orthogonal design, as detailed in the solution text.\n        \n        # 1.
