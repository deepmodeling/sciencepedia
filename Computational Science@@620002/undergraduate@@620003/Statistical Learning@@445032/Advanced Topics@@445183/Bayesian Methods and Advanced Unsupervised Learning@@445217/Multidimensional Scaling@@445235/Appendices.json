It is scientifically grounded in Euclidean geometry and linear algebra, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively formulated.\n\n### Task 1: Geometry-Based Reconstruction\n\nThe problem requires finding the coordinates of an unknown point $P=(x,y)$ given its Euclidean distances to three known anchor points: $A_{1}=(0,0)$, $A_{2}=(3,0)$, and $A_{3}=(0,4)$. The measured distances are $\\|P-A_{1}\\|=\\sqrt{2}$, $\\|P-A_{2}\\|=\\sqrt{5}$, and $\\|P-A_{3}\\|=\\sqrt{10}$.\n\nThe relationship between a point $(x,y)$ and an anchor $(x_i, y_i)$ with distance $d_i$ is given by the equation of a circle:\n$$ (x-x_i)^2 + (y-y_i)^2 = d_i^2 $$\nSubstituting the given values, we obtain a system of three quadratic equations:\n1.  For anchor $A_1=(0,0)$ with distance $\\sqrt{2}$:\n    $$ (x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 = (\\sqrt{2})^2 \\implies x^2 + y^2 = 2 \\quad (1) $$\n2.  For anchor $A_2=(3,0)$ with distance $\\sqrt{5}$:\n    $$ (x-3)^2 + (y-0)^2 = (\\sqrt{5})^2 \\implies x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 = 5 \\quad (2) $$\n3.  For anchor $A_3=(0,4)$ with distance $\\sqrt{10}$:\n    $$ (x-0)^2 + (y-4)^2 = (\\sqrt{10})^2 \\implies x^2 + y^2 - 8y + 16 = 10 \\quad (3) $$\n\nTo solve this system, we can eliminate the quadratic terms ($x^2$ and $y^2$) by subtracting the equations from one another. This procedure generates linear equations representing the radical axes of pairs of circles. The intersection of these lines gives the coordinates of point $P$.\n\nSubtracting equation $(1)$ from equation $(2)$:\n$$ (x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2) - (x^2 + y^2) = 5 - 2 $$\n$$ -6x + 9 = 3 $$\n$$ -6x = -6 $$\n$$ x = 1 $$\n\nSubtracting equation $(1)$ from equation $(3)$:\n$$ (x^2 + y^2 - 8y + 16) - (x^2 + y^2) = 10 - 2 $$\n$$ -8y + 16 = 8 $$\n$$ -8y = -8 $$\n$$ y = 1 $$\n\nThe solution to the linear system is $(x,y) = (1,1)$. To confirm, we must verify that this point satisfies all three original equations:\n1.  $1^2 + 1^2 = 1+1 = 2$. Correct.\n2.  $(1-3)^2 + 1^2 = (-2)^2 + 1 = 4+1 = 5$. Correct.\n3.  $1^2 + (1-4)^2 = 1 + (-3)^2 = 1+9 = 10$. Correct.\n\nThe coordinates of the point $P$ are $(1,1)$.\n\nThe solution is unique because the three anchor points $A_1, A_2, A_3$ are not collinear. The vectors $\\vec{A_1A_2} = (3,0)$ and $\\vec{A_1A_3} = (0,4)$ are linearly independent. The process of subtracting circle equations yields linear equations that define the radical axes. The radical axis of two circles is a line. The first linear equation, $x=1$, is the radical axis of the circles centered at $A_1$ and $A_2$. The second linear equation, $y=1$, is the radical axis of the circles centered at $A_1$ and $A_3$. Since the anchors are non-collinear, the normals to these radical axes are not parallel, which ensures that the lines themselves are not parallel and thus intersect at a single point. This unique intersection is the only point that satisfies all three distance constraints.\n\n### Task 2: Connection to Classical Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)\n\nThis task requires demonstrating the equivalence between the geometric solution (trilateration) and classical MDS. We must first derive the identity $B = -\\frac{1}{2}H D^{2} H = X_{c}X_{c}^{\\top}$ and then verify it with the given data.\n\n**Derivation of the MDS Identity:**\nLet $X$ be an $n \\times p$ matrix where each row $x_i^\\top$ represents the coordinates of a point in $\\mathbb{R}^p$. Let $G = XX^\\top$ be the Gram matrix of inner products, with entries $g_{ij} = x_i^\\top x_j$. The squared Euclidean distance between points $i$ and $j$ is $d_{ij}^2 = \\|x_i - x_j\\|^2 = (x_i-x_j)^\\top(x_i-x_j) = x_i^\\top x_i - 2x_i^\\top x_j + x_j^\\top x_j = g_{ii} + g_{jj} - 2g_{ij}$.\n\nLet the mean-centered coordinates be $X_c = HX$, where $H = I - \\frac{1}{n} \\mathbf{1}\\mathbf{1}^\\top$ is the centering matrix. The centered Gram matrix is $B = X_c X_c^\\top = (HX)(HX)^\\top = H(XX^\\top)H^\\top = HGH$, since $H$ is symmetric ($H=H^\\top$). The entries of $B$ are $b_{ij} = g_{ij} - \\bar{g}_{i.} - \\bar{g}_{.j} + \\bar{g}_{..}$, where the overbar with a dot denotes averaging over that index.\n\nThe core of classical MDS is to recover $B$ from the squared distance matrix $D^2$. Let us analyze the matrix $B_{MDS} = -\\frac{1}{2}H D^2 H$. Its $(i,j)$-th element is given by the double-centering operation on $-\\frac{1}{2}d_{ij}^2$:\n$$ (B_{MDS})_{ij} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left( d_{ij}^2 - \\overline{d^2_{i.}} - \\overline{d^2_{.j}} + \\overline{d^2_{..}} \\right) $$\nWe substitute $d_{ij}^2 = g_{ii} + g_{jj} - 2g_{ij}$ into the terms:\n$$ \\overline{d^2_{i.}} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=1}^n d_{ik}^2 = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=1}^n (g_{ii} + g_{kk} - 2g_{ik}) = g_{ii} + \\frac{1}{n}\\mathrm{Tr}(G) - 2\\bar{g}_{i.} $$\n$$ \\overline{d^2_{.j}} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=1}^n d_{kj}^2 = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=1}^n (g_{kk} + g_{jj} - 2g_{kj}) = \\frac{1}{n}\\mathrm{Tr}(G) + g_{jj} - 2\\bar{g}_{.j} $$\n$$ \\overline{d^2_{..}} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=1}^n \\overline{d^2_{k.}} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=1}^n (g_{kk} + \\frac{1}{n}\\mathrm{Tr}(G) - 2\\bar{g}_{k.}) = \\frac{1}{n}\\mathrm{Tr}(G) + \\frac{1}{n}\\mathrm{Tr}(G) - 2\\bar{g}_{..} = \\frac{2}{n}\\mathrm{Tr}(G) - 2\\bar{g}_{..} $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $(B_{MDS})_{ij}$:\n$$ (B_{MDS})_{ij} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (g_{ii} + g_{jj} - 2g_{ij}) - (g_{ii} + \\frac{\\mathrm{Tr}(G)}{n} - 2\\bar{g}_{i.}) - (\\frac{\\mathrm{Tr}(G)}{n} + g_{jj} - 2\\bar{g}_{.j}) + (\\frac{2\\mathrm{Tr}(G)}{n} - 2\\bar{g}_{..}) \\right] $$\n$$ = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ -2g_{ij} + 2\\bar{g}_{i.} + 2\\bar{g}_{.j} - 2\\bar{g}_{..} \\right] = g_{ij} - \\bar{g}_{i.} - \\bar{g}_{.j} + \\bar{g}_{..} $$\nThis is precisely the $(i,j)$-th entry of $HGH = B$. Thus, $B = -\\frac{1}{2}H D^2 H = X_c X_c^\\top$, which completes the derivation.\n\n**Verification for the Specific Problem:**\nLet the four points be $x_1=A_1=(0,0)$, $x_2=A_2=(3,0)$, $x_3=A_3=(0,4)$, and $x_4=P=(1,1)$.

We will use the component-wise formula. First, we find the row/column means and the grand mean of $D^2$.\nRow sums: $\\{27, 39, 51, 17\\}$. Row means (divide by $n=4$): $\\overline{d^2_{i.}} = \\{\\frac{27}{4}, \\frac{39}{4}, \\frac{51}{4}, \\frac{17}{4}\\}$.\nTotal sum: $27+39+51+17=134$. Grand mean (divide by $n^2=16$): $\\overline{d^2_{..}} = \\frac{134}{16} = \\frac{67}{8}$.\nUsing $b_{ij} = -\\frac{1}{2} ( d_{ij}^2 - \\overline{d^2_{i.}} - \\overline{d^2_{.j}} + \\overline{d^2_{..}} )$:\n- $b_{11} = -\\frac{1}{2}(0 - \\frac{27}{4} - \\frac{27}{4} + \\frac{67}{8}) = -\\frac{1}{2}(-\\frac{108}{8} + \\frac{67}{8}) = -\\frac{1}{2}(-\\frac{41}{8}) = \\frac{41}{16}$.\n- $b_{12} = -\\frac{1}{2}(9 - \\frac{27}{4} - \\frac{39}{4} + \\frac{67}{8}) = -\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{72-54-78+67}{8}) = -\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{7}{8}) = -\\frac{7}{16}$.\n- $b_{13} = -\\frac{1}{2}(16 - \\frac{27}{4} - \\frac{51}{4} + \\frac{67}{8}) = -\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{128-54-102+67}{8}) = -\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{39}{8}) = -\\frac{39}{16}$.\n- $b_{23} = -\\frac{1}{2}(25 - \\frac{39}{4} - \\frac{51}{4} + \\frac{67}{8}) = -\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{200-78-102+67}{8}) = -\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{87}{8}) = -\\frac{87}{16}$.\nContinuing for all elements, we construct the matrix $B$:\n$$ B = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{41}{16} & -\\frac{7}{16} & -\\frac{39}{16} & \\frac{5}{16} \\\\ -\\frac{7}{16} & \\frac{89}{16} & -\\frac{87}{16} & \\frac{5}{16} \\\\ -\\frac{39}{16} & -\\frac{87}{16} & \\frac{137}{16} & -\\frac{11}{16} \\\\ \\frac{5}{16} & \\frac{5}{16} & -\\frac{11}{16} & \\frac{1}{16} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nNow, we compute the centered Gram matrix $X_c X_c^\\top$ directly from the coordinates.\nThe coordinate matrix is $X^\\top = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 3 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 4 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe mean coordinate vector is $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{4}\\sum x_i = \\frac{1}{4}( (0,0)+(3,0)+(0,4)+(1,1) ) = \\frac{1}{4}(4,5) = (1, \\frac{5}{4})$.\nThe centered coordinate vectors $x_{c,i} = x_i - \\bar{x}$ are:\n- $x_{c,1} = (0,0) - (1, \\frac{5}{4}) = (-1, -\\frac{5}{4})$\n- $x_{c,2} = (3,0) - (1, \\frac{5}{4}) = (2, -\\frac{5}{4})$\n- $x_{c,3} = (0,4) - (1, \\frac{5}{4}) = (-1, \\frac{11}{4})$\n- $x_{c,4} = (1,1) - (1, \\frac{5}{4}) = (0, -\\frac{1}{4})$\nThe centered coordinate matrix is $X_c = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -5/4 \\\\ 2 & -5/4 \\\\ -1 & 11/4 \\\\ 0 & -1/4 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe centered Gram matrix is $X_c X_c^\\top$.

The new dissimilarity matrix is $\\Delta'$, with entries $\\delta'_{ij} = a \\delta_{ij}$ for a constant $a > 0$.\n\n**Analysis of Classical MDS**\n\n1.  **Squared Dissimilarities**: Classical MDS operates on the matrix of squared dissimilarities. Let $D^{(2)}$ be the matrix with entries $d^{(2)}_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}^2$. The new matrix of squared dissimilarities, $D^{(2)'}$, has entries $d^{(2)'}_{ij} = (\\delta'_{ij})^2 = (a\\delta_{ij})^2 = a^2 \\delta_{ij}^2 = a^2 d^{(2)}_{ij}$. Thus, $D^{(2)'} = a^2 D^{(2)}$.\n\n2.  **Double Centering**: The Gram matrix $B$ is obtained by double centering the matrix $S = -\\frac{1}{2} D^{(2)}$. The double-centering operation is given by $B = J S J$, where $J = I - \\frac{1}{n} \\mathbf{1}\\mathbf{1}^T$ is the centering matrix ($I$ is the identity matrix, $\\mathbf{1}$ is a column vector of all ones).\n    For the scaled dissimilarities, the corresponding matrix is $S' = -\\frac{1}{2} D^{(2)'} = -\\frac{1}{2} (a^2 D^{(2)}) = a^2 S$.\n    The new Gram matrix $B'$ is:\n    $$ B' = J S' J = J (a^2 S) J = a^2 (J S J) = a^2 B $$\n    So, the new Gram matrix is the original Gram matrix scaled by $a^2$.\n\n3.  **Eigen-decomposition**: Let the eigen-decomposition of $B$ be $B v_k = \\lambda_k v_k$, where $\\lambda_k$ are the eigenvalues and $v_k$ are the corresponding eigenvectors.\n    Now, consider the eigen-decomposition for $B'$:\n    $$ B' v_k = (a^2 B) v_k = a^2 (B v_k) = a^2 (\\lambda_k v_k) = (a^2 \\lambda_k) v_k $$\n    This shows that $B'$ has the same eigenvectors $v_k$ as $B$. The new eigenvalues are $\\lambda'_k = a^2 \\lambda_k$.\n\n4.  **Configuration Coordinates**: The coordinates of the points in a $p$-dimensional embedding are given by the rows of the matrix $X = V_p \\Lambda_p^{1/2}$. Here, $V_p$ is the $n \\times p$ matrix whose columns are the first $p$ eigenvectors (corresponding to the $p$ largest positive eigenvalues), and $\\Lambda_p$ is the $p \\times p$ diagonal matrix of these eigenvalues.\n    The new coordinate matrix $X'$ is:\n    $$ X' = V'_p (\\Lambda'_p)^{1/2} $$\n    Since the eigenvectors are unchanged, $V'_p = V_p$. The new eigenvalue matrix is $\\Lambda'_p = a^2 \\Lambda_p$. Therefore:\n    $$ X' = V_p (a^2 \\Lambda_p)^{1/2} = V_p (a \\Lambda_p^{1/2}) = a (V_p \\Lambda_p^{1/2}) = a X $$\n    The coordinates of the new configuration are the original coordinates scaled by the factor $a$.\n\n**Analysis of Nonmetric MDS**\n\nLet the configuration of $n$ points in a $p$-dimensional space be $X = (x_1, \\dots, x_n)^T$. The interpoint Euclidean distances are $d_{ij}(X) = \\|x_i - x_j\\|$. The disparities $\\hat{d}_{ij}$ are values that are monotonically non-decreasing with the dissimilarities $\\delta_{ij}$.\n\n5.  **Raw (Unnormalized) Stress**: The raw stress objective function is:\n    $$ \\text{Stress}_0(X, \\hat{d}) = \\sum_{i<j} (d_{ij}(X) - \\hat{d}_{ij})^2 $$\n    The goal is to find the configuration $X$ and disparities $\\hat{d}_{ij} = f(\\delta_{ij})$ (for some monotone function $f$) that minimize this quantity. Let the minimum achievable stress for the original problem be $S_0^*$, obtained at $(X^*, \\hat{d}^*)$.\n    $$ S_0^* = \\sum_{i<j} (d_{ij}(X^*) - \\hat{d}^*_{ij})^2 $$\n    For the new problem with $\\delta'_{ij} = a\\delta_{ij}$, we seek to minimize $\\text{Stress}'_0(X', \\hat{d}') = \\sum_{i<j} (d_{ij}(X') - \\hat{d}'_{ij})^2$.\n    Consider the proposed solution $X' = aX^*$ and $\\hat{d}'_{ij} = a\\hat{d}^*_{ij}$.\n    The distances for this new configuration are $d_{ij}(X') = d_{ij}(aX^*) = \\|ax_i^* - ax_j^*\\| = a\\|x_i^* - x_j^*\\| = a d_{ij}(X^*)$.\n    Also, if $\\hat{d}^*_{ij}$ is monotone with $\\delta_{ij}$, then $\\hat{d}'_{ij} = a\\hat{d}^*_{ij}$ is monotone with $\\delta'_{ij} = a\\delta_{ij}$, since $a>0$.\n    The stress value for this proposed solution is:\n    $$ \\sum_{i<j} (a d_{ij}(X^*) - a \\hat{d}^*_{ij})^2 = a^2 \\sum_{i<j} (d_{ij}(X^*) - \\hat{d}^*_{ij})^2 = a^2 S_0^* $$\n    This shows a stress of $a^2 S_0^*$ is achievable. A reverse argument shows that one cannot do better, confirming that the new minimum raw stress is exactly $a^2 S_0^*$.\n\n6.  **Kruskal's Normalized Stress-1**: Kruskal's Stress-$1$ is defined as:\n    $$ \\text{Stress}_1(X, \\hat{d}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i<j} (d_{ij}(X) - \\hat{d}_{ij})^2}{\\sum_{i<j} d_{ij}(X)^2}} $$\n    The minimization is performed over the configuration $X$ and all disparity vectors $\\hat{d}$ that are monotone with the dissimilarities $\\delta$.\n    Let $\\mathcal{M}(\\delta)$ be the set of all vectors $\\hat{d} = (\\hat{d}_{12}, \\hat{d}_{13}, \\dots)$ that are monotone with respect to the ordering of the dissimilarities in $\\delta = (\\delta_{12}, \\delta_{13}, \\dots)$.\n    The minimization problem for the original dissimilarities is:\n    $$ S_1^* = \\min_{X, \\hat{d} \\in \\mathcal{M}(\\delta)} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i<j} (d_{ij}(X) - \\hat{d}_{ij})^2}{\\sum_{i<j} d_{ij}(X)^2}} $$\n    For the scaled dissimilarities $\\delta' = a\\delta$, the corresponding set of monotone vectors is $\\mathcal{M}(\\delta')$. Since $a > 0$, the ordering of dissimilarities is preserved: $\\delta_{ij} < \\delta_{kl} \\Leftrightarrow a\\delta_{ij} < a\\delta_{kl}$. Therefore, the set of allowed disparity vectors is unchanged: $\\mathcal{M}(\\delta) = \\mathcal{M}(\\delta')$.\n    The minimization problem for the scaled dissimilarities is:\n    $$ {S'}_1^* = \\min_{X, \\hat{d} \\in \\mathcal{M}(\\delta')} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i<j} (d_{ij}(X) - \\hat{d}_{ij})^2}{\\sum_{i<j} d_{ij}(X)^2}} $$\n    Since $\\mathcal{M}(\\delta) = \\mathcal{M}(\\delta')$, the two optimization problems are identical. They have the same objective function being minimized over the same domain.\n    Therefore, the optimal Stress-$1$ value is unchanged: ${S'}_1^* = S_1^*$. Furthermore, the set of optimal configurations $X^*$ is also the same. In MDS, solutions are always defined up to translation, rotation, and reflection. For a normalized stress function like Stress-$1$, the objective is also invariant to a global scaling of the configuration $X$ (as the scaling factor cancels from the numerator and denominator), so the optimal configuration is defined up to all similarity transforms, including overall scale.\n\n7.  **Rank Order of Fitted Disparities**: The fitted disparities $\\hat{d}^*_{ij}$ are obtained from the optimal configuration $X^*$ by finding the vector $\\hat{d} \\in \\mathcal{M}(\\delta)$ that is closest to the vector of distances $d(X^*)$ in a least-squares sense (this is the isotonic regression step).\n    As established in the analysis of Stress-$1$, scaling the dissimilarities by $a>0$ does not change the optimal configuration $X^*$ (up to similarity transforms) or the set of constraints $\\mathcal{M}(\\delta)$. Therefore, the isotonic regression problem to find the optimal disparities remains identical: one is regressing the same vector of distances $d(X^*)$ onto the same constraint set $\\mathcal{M}(\\delta)$.\n    Consequently, the optimal disparities are also unchanged: $\\hat{d}'^* = \\hat{d}^*$. If the disparities themselves are identical, their rank order must also be identical.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. In classical MDS, multiplying all dissimilarities by $a$ multiplies all eigenvalues of the double-centered Gram matrix by $a^{2}$, and leaves its eigenvectors unchanged up to sign; consequently, the resulting coordinates are scaled by a factor $a$.**\n_Analysis_: Our derivation in points $1-4$ shows that the new Gram matrix is $B' = a^2 B$. This leads to new eigenvalues $\\lambda'_k = a^2 \\lambda_k$ (multiplied by $a^2$) and unchanged eigenvectors $v'_k=v_k$. The resulting coordinates are $X' = aX$ (scaled by $a$).\n_Verdict_: **Correct**.\n\n**B. In classical MDS, multiplying all dissimilarities by $a$ multiplies all eigenvalues by $a$ while leaving eigenvectors unchanged; consequently, the resulting coordinates are scaled by a factor $\\sqrt{a}$.**\n_Analysis_: This contradicts our derivation. The eigenvalues scale by $a^2$, not $a$. The coordinates scale by $a$, not $\\sqrt{a}$.\n_Verdict_: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. In nonmetric MDS with Kruskal’s normalized Stress-$1$, multiplying all dissimilarities by a positive constant $a$ leaves the optimal Stress-$1$ value unchanged and preserves the optimal configuration up to similarity transforms (translation, rotation, reflection, and overall scale).**\n_Analysis_: Our derivation in point $6$ shows that the optimization problem for Stress-$1$ is invariant to scaling the dissimilarities by $a>0$. The minimum stress value is unchanged, and the optimal configuration is preserved up to transforms that leave the stress value invariant, which for Stress-$1$ are precisely the similarity transforms listed.\n_Verdict_: **Correct**.\n\n**D. In nonmetric MDS with raw (unnormalized) stress, multiplying all dissimilarities by $a$ multiplies the minimal achievable raw stress by $a^{2}$ (for a fixed embedding dimension).**\n_Analysis_: Our derivation in point $5$ shows that the optimal raw stress for the scaled problem is $a^2$ times the original optimal raw stress.\n_Verdict_: **Correct**.\n\n**E. In nonmetric MDS, multiplying all dissimilarities by a positive constant $a$ changes the rank order of the fitted disparities that result from the optimal monotone regression step.**\n_Analysis_: Our derivation in point $7$ shows that for normalized MDS, the optimal disparities are themselves unchanged, because neither the distances from the optimal configuration nor the ordering constraints change. If the disparities are unchanged, their rank order cannot change. This statement claims the rank order changes.\n_Verdict_: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "3150710"}, {"introduction": "Real-world data is rarely perfect, and understanding how an algorithm handles imperfections is crucial for robust analysis.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nFirst, we compute the matrix of dissimilarities $\\Delta = (\\delta_{ij})$ using the given coordinates. The objects are $A(0,0)$, $B(1,0)$, $C(1,0)$, $D(0,1)$, and $E(2,0)$.\n\nThe pairwise Euclidean distances are:\n- $\\delta_{AB} = \\lVert (1,0) - (0,0) \\rVert = 1$\n- $\\delta_{AC} = \\lVert (1,0) - (0,0) \\rVert = 1$\n- $\\delta_{AD} = \\lVert (0,1) - (0,0) \\rVert = 1$\n- $\\delta_{AE} = \\lVert (2,0) - (0,0) \\rVert = 2$\n- $\\delta_{BC} = \\lVert (1,0) - (1,0) \\rVert = 0$\n- $\\delta_{BD} = \\lVert (0,1) - (1,0) \\rVert = \\sqrt{(0-1)^2 + (1-0)^2} = \\sqrt{2}$\n- $\\delta_{BE} = \\lVert (2,0) - (1,0) \\rVert = 1$\n- $\\delta_{CD} = \\lVert (0,1) - (1,0) \\rVert = \\sqrt{2}$\n- $\\delta_{CE} = \\lVert (2,0) - (1,0) \\rVert = 1$\n- $\\delta_{DE} = \\lVert (2,0) - (0,1) \\rVert = \\sqrt{(2-0)^2 + (0-1)^2} = \\sqrt{5}$\n\nThe dissimilarity matrix $\\Delta$ is symmetric with zeros on the diagonal. The upper triangle is:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n- & 0 & 0 & \\sqrt{2} & 1 \\\\\n- & - & 0 & \\sqrt{2} & 1 \\\\\n- & - & - & 0 & \\sqrt{5} \\\\\n- & - & - & - & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nKey observations:\n1.  Objects $B$ and $C$ are indistinguishable based on dissimilarities: $\\delta_{iB} = \\delta_{iC}$ for all $i \\in \\{A, B, C, D, E\\}$.\n2.  There are multiple tied dissimilarities, e.g., $\\delta_{AB} = \\delta_{AC} = \\delta_{AD} = \\delta_{BE} = \\delta_{CE} = 1$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. In classical MDS, forming the double-centered Gram matrix from the squared dissimilarities for this dataset yields identical rows and columns for the duplicate objects $B$ and $C$, so $(\\mathbf{e}_B - \\mathbf{e}_C)$ is a nontrivial null vector. Consequently, any exact fit places $B$ and $C$ at the same coordinates, introducing degeneracy along that direction.**\n\nClassical MDS operates on the matrix of squared dissimilarities, $D^{(2)} = (\\delta_{ij}^2)$. Since $\\delta_{iB} = \\delta_{iC}$ for all $i$, it follows that $\\delta_{iB}^2 = \\delta_{iC}^2$ for all $i$. This means that the column corresponding to object $B$ in the matrix $D^{(2)}$ is identical to the column for object $C$. By symmetry, the rows are also identical.\n\nClassical MDS then computes the Gram matrix (or inner product matrix) $B = -\\frac{1}{2}J D^{(2)} J$, where $J = I - n^{-1}\\mathbf{1}\\mathbf{1}^T$ is the centering matrix. Let the columns of $D^{(2)}$ be $d_1, \\dots, d_n$. The columns of $D^{(2)}J$ are $d_j - \\bar{d}$, where $\\bar{d}$ is the column-wise mean. Since the columns for $B$ and $C$ in $D^{(2)}$ are identical ($d_B=d_C$), their centered versions will also be identical. Applying the left-multiplication by $J$ also preserves this identity for the columns of the final matrix $B$. Thus, the columns $B_B$ and $B_C$ of the Gram matrix $B$ are identical.\n\nThe vector $v = \\mathbf{e}_B - \\mathbf{e}_C$ is a vector with $1$ at position $B$, $-1$ at position $C$, and $0$ elsewhere. Let us compute $Bv$:\n$Bv = B(\\mathbf{e}_B - \\mathbf{e}_C) = B\\mathbf{e}_B - B\\mathbf{e}_C = B_B - B_C$.\nSince we established $B_B = B_C$, it follows that $Bv = 0$. This means $v$ is an eigenvector of $B$ with an eigenvalue of $0$. It is a non-trivial vector in the null space of $B$.\n\nThe coordinates $X$ recovered by classical MDS satisfy $B = XX^T$ (for centered coordinates). If $\\tilde{x}_i$ is the $i$-th row of $X$ (the centered coordinate for object $i$), then $B_{ij} = \\tilde{x}_i \\cdot \\tilde{x}_j$. Since the rows $B$ and $C$ of matrix $B$ are identical, we have $B_{Bi} = B_{Ci}$ for all $i$. This means $\\tilde{x}_B \\cdot \\tilde{x}_i = \\tilde{x}_C \\cdot \\tilde{x}_i$ for all $i$.\nThis implies that $(\\tilde{x}_B - \\tilde{x}_C) \\cdot \\tilde{x}_i = 0$ for all $i$. If the vectors $\\{\\tilde{x}_i\\}$ span the embedding space (which they do by construction), this requires $\\tilde{x}_B - \\tilde{x}_C = 0$, so $\\tilde{x}_B = \\tilde{x}_C$. The recovered centered coordinates are identical, and thus the final non-centered coordinates are also identical.\nThe statement is a precise and accurate description of the consequences of duplicate objects in classical MDS.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. In non-metric MDS with a monotone transformation of dissimilarities, the presence of ties such as $\\delta_{AB} = \\delta_{AC} = \\delta_{AD} = 1$ and $\\delta_{BE} = \\delta_{CE} = 1$ can lead to multiple equivalent minima if ties are not pooled. Enforcing tie-handling by assigning a single fitted disparity per tied group stabilizes the solution without changing the target ranks.**\n\nThis statement addresses non-metric MDS, where the goal is to find a configuration whose distances $d_{ij}$ are monotonic with the original dissimilarities $\\delta_{ij}$. The fitted values that the $d_{ij}$ are compared against are called disparities, $\\hat{d}_{ij}$. The standard approach to handling ties in dissimilarities (the \"primary approach\") only enforces the monotonicity constraint for strictly unequal dissimilarities. That is, if $\\delta_{ij} < \\delta_{kl}$, then $\\hat{d}_{ij} \\le \\hat{d}_{kl}$. If $\\delta_{ij} = \\delta_{kl}$, no constraint is placed on the relationship between $\\hat{d}_{ij}$ and $\\hat{d}_{kl}$. This lack of constraint for tied values can create flat regions or multiple local minima in the stress landscape, as the optimization has extra degrees of freedom, potentially leading to unstable or non-unique solutions.\n\nThe second part of the statement describes the \"secondary approach\" to ties. Here, one enforces the additional constraint that if $\\delta_{ij} = \\delta_{kl}$, then $\\hat{d}_{ij} = \\hat{d}_{kl}$. This is known as pooling ties or using a tie-aware model. By requiring all dissimilarities in a tied group to map to a single disparity value, this method adds constraints to the optimization problem. This generally regularizes the problem, making the stress surface better-behaved and leading to a more stable and unique solution. This procedure does not change the target ranks; it simply refines the definition of monotonicity for tied values.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. A standard and guaranteed-safe remedy for degeneracy is to add independent random jitter of magnitude on the order of the largest dissimilarity (for example, replace each $\\delta_{ij}$ by $\\delta_{ij} + \\epsilon_{ij}$ where $\\epsilon_{ij} \\sim \\text{Uniform}(-2,2)$), which breaks ties while preserving the limiting configuration.**\n\nAdding a small amount of random noise (jitter) is a known heuristic to break ties and avoid some forms of degeneracy. However, the magnitude of this jitter is critical. The largest dissimilarity in this dataset is $\\delta_{DE} = \\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.236$. The proposed jitter is $\\epsilon_{ij} \\sim U(-2, 2)$, which is on the same order of magnitude as the dissimilarities themselves. For instance, the dissimilarity $\\delta_{BC} = 0$ could become $\\delta'_{BC} \\approx 1.9$, while the dissimilarity $\\delta_{AB} = 1$ could become $\\delta'_{AB} \\approx 1 + (-1.9) = -0.9$. Such large perturbations would completely corrupt the data structure. It would not just break ties, but would scramble the rank ordering of the dissimilarities, leading to a configuration that is a solution to a dramatically different problem. The phrase \"preserving the limiting configuration\" is false; the configuration would be based on noise-dominated data. A proper use of jitter would involve noise with a magnitude far smaller than the smallest difference between distinct dissimilarity values.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. A principled way to mitigate degeneracy due to exact duplicates is to merge $B$ and $C$ into a single object with weight $2$ in the stress objective or, equivalently, to average duplicate observations before running MDS, thereby avoiding double-counting identical information.**\n\nSince objects $B$ and $C$ are identical from the perspective of the dissimilarity matrix, they contain redundant information. A principled approach is to address this redundancy. One way is to remove one of the objects (say, $C$) from the dataset, perform MDS on the reduced set $\\{A, B, D, E\\}$, and then assign the resulting coordinate of $B$ to $C$. This is what \"averaging duplicate observations\" effectively reduces to in this case, since $\\delta_{iB} = \\delta_{iC}$ makes any averaging trivial. Another approach, common in weighted MDS, is to treat the duplicate points as a single point with a higher weight (e.g., weight $w_{BC} = 2$) during the optimization of the stress function. Both methods aim to solve the same underlying problem: how to represent the structure accurately without the instability caused by redundant data. While the specific algorithms for weighted MDS and reduced-set MDS are different, they are conceptually equivalent in their goal of correcting for the redundancy. The statement correctly identifies these as \"principled\" ways to handle the issue.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. Duplicates necessarily prevent metric MDS from achieving zero stress in $p=2$ on this dataset, because placing $B$ and $C$ at the same coordinates makes it impossible for both to be at distance $1$ from $E$ simultaneously.**\n\nThe goal of metric MDS is to find a configuration $z_1, \\dots, z_n$ in $\\mathbb{R}^p$ such that the distances $d_{ij} = \\lVert z_i - z_j \\rVert$ are as close as possible to the given dissimilarities $\\delta_{ij}$. A zero-stress solution is achieved if we can find a configuration where $d_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$ for all pairs $(i,j)$. The original dissimilarities $\\delta_{ij}$ were generated from a set of points $x_A, \\dots, x_E$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The target dimension is $p=2$. Therefore, the original configuration $x_A, \\dots, x_E$ is itself a perfect solution. If we choose the new coordinates $z_i = x_i$, then the distances in the new configuration will be identical to the original dissimilarities, i.e., $d_{ij} = \\lVert z_i - z_j \\rVert = \\lVert x_i - x_j \\rVert = \\delta_{ij}$. This configuration achieves a stress of zero.\n\nThe argument presented in the statement is fallacious. It claims that if we place $B$ and $C$ at the same coordinate $z_B=z_C$, it's impossible for both to be at distance $1$ from $E$. In the original configuration (which is a zero-stress solution), we have $z_B = z_C = (1,0)$ and $z_E = (2,0)$. The distance is $\\lVert z_E - z_B \\rVert = \\lVert (2,0) - (1,0) \\rVert = 1$ and $\\lVert z_E - z_C \\rVert = \\lVert (2,0) - (1,0) \\rVert = 1$. Both conditions are satisfied simultaneously. The premise of the argument is demonstrably false.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "3150735"}]}
