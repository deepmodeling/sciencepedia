First, we perform a formal derivation of the gradient of the t-SNE objective function for a general kernel. Second, we analyze this gradient for two specific kernels and evaluate their properties as requested.\n\n### Step 1: General Gradient Derivation\n\nThe objective function to be minimized is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between high-dimensional similarities $p_{ij}$ and low-dimensional similarities $q_{ij}$:\n$$\nC(y) = \\sum_{i \\ne j} p_{ij} \\log\\left(\\frac{p_{ij}}{q_{ij}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $y_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ are the low-dimensional embeddings. The high-dimensional similarities $p_{ij}$ are given as fixed, symmetric ($p_{ij}=p_{ji}$), and normalized such that $\\sum_{i \\ne j} p_{ij} = 1$. The low-dimensional similarities $q_{ij}$ are defined using a differentiable radial kernel $g(r)$:\n$$\nq_{ij} = \\frac{g(r_{ij})}{\\sum_{k \\ne \\ell} g(r_{k\\ell})} = \\frac{g(r_{ij})}{Z}\n$$\nwhere $r_{ij} = \\lVert y_i - y_j \\rVert$ and $Z = \\sum_{k \\ne \\ell} g(r_{k\\ell})$ is the normalization constant.\n\nWe can rewrite the cost function $C(y)$ by separating the terms involving $y$:\n$$\nC(y) = \\sum_{i \\ne j} p_{ij} \\log p_{ij} - \\sum_{i \\ne j} p_{ij} \\log q_{ij}\n$$\nThe first term is constant with respect to $y_i$. Substituting the definition of $q_{ij}$:\n$$\nC(y) = \\text{const} - \\sum_{i \\ne j} p_{ij} \\log \\left( \\frac{g(r_{ij})}{Z} \\right) = \\text{const} - \\sum_{i \\ne j} p_{ij} \\log g(r_{ij}) + \\left(\\sum_{i \\ne j} p_{ij}\\right) \\log Z\n$$\nSince $\\sum_{i \\ne j} p_{ij} = 1$, we have:\n$$\nC(y) = \\text{const} - \\sum_{i \\ne j} p_{ij} \\log g(r_{ij}) + \\log \\left( \\sum_{k \\ne \\ell} g(r_{k\\ell}) \\right)\n$$\nWe seek the negative gradient, or \"force\", $F_i = -\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y_i}$. We compute the gradient $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y_i}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y_i} = -\\sum_{k \\ne \\ell} p_{k\\ell} \\frac{1}{g(r_{k\\ell})} \\frac{\\partial g(r_{k\\ell})}{\\partial y_i} + \\frac{1}{Z} \\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial y_i}\n$$\nThe derivative of a function of a pairwise distance $f(r_{k\\ell})$ with respect to $y_i$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f(r_{k\\ell})}{\\partial y_i} = f'(r_{k\\ell}) \\frac{\\partial r_{k\\ell}}{\\partial y_i} = f'(r_{k\\ell}) \\frac{y_k - y_\\ell}{r_{k\\ell}} (\\delta_{ik} - \\delta_{i\\ell}) = f'(r_{k\\ell}) u_{k\\ell} (\\delta_{ik} - \\delta_{i\\ell})\n$$\nwhere $u_{k\\ell} = (y_k - y_\\ell) / r_{k\\ell}$ is the unit direction vector.\n\nApplying this, the sum in the first term of $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y_i}$ is non-zero only when $k=i$ or $\\ell=i$:\n$$\n-\\sum_{k \\ne \\ell} p_{k\\ell} \\frac{g'(r_{k\\ell})}{g(r_{k\\ell})} u_{k\\ell} (\\delta_{ik} - \\delta_{i\\ell}) = -\\sum_{j \\ne i} p_{ij} \\frac{g'(r_{ij})}{g(r_{ij})} u_{ij} - \\sum_{j \\ne i} p_{ji} \\frac{g'(r_{ji})}{g(r_{ji})} (-u_{ji})\n$$\nUsing $r_{ij}=r_{ji}$ and $u_{ij}=-u_{ji}$, the second part becomes $-\\sum_{j \\ne i} p_{ji} \\frac{g'(r_{ij})}{g(r_{ij})} u_{ij}$. Combining these gives:\n$$\n-\\sum_{j \\ne i} (p_{ij} + p_{ji}) \\frac{g'(r_{ij})}{g(r_{ij})} u_{ij}\n$$\nSimilarly, the derivative of the normalization constant $Z$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial y_i} = \\sum_{k \\ne \\ell} g'(r_{k\\ell}) u_{k\\ell} (\\delta_{ik} - \\delta_{i\\ell}) = \\sum_{j \\ne i} g'(r_{ij})u_{ij} - \\sum_{j \\ne i} g'(r_{ji})u_{ji} = \\sum_{j \\ne i} (g'(r_{ij})u_{ij} - g'(r_{ij})(-u_{ij})) = 2\\sum_{j \\ne i} g'(r_{ij}) u_{ij}\n$$\nCombining all parts, the gradient is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y_i} = -\\sum_{j \\ne i} (p_{ij} + p_{ji}) \\frac{g'(r_{ij})}{g(r_{ij})} u_{ij} + \\frac{2}{Z} \\sum_{j \\ne i} g'(r_{ij}) u_{ij}\n$$\nRearranging the sum:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y_i} = \\sum_{j \\ne i} \\left( \\frac{2 g'(r_{ij})}{Z} - (p_{ij} + p_{ji}) \\frac{g'(r_{ij})}{g(r_{ij})} \\right) u_{ij}\n$$\nThe force $F_i = -\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y_i}$ is therefore:\n$$\nF_i = \\sum_{j \\ne i} \\left( (p_{ij} + p_{ji}) \\frac{g'(r_{ij})}{g(r_{ij})} - \\frac{2 g'(r_{ij})}{Z} \\right) u_{ij}\n$$\nThis expression separates the force on point $y_i$ into a sum of pairwise contributions from other points $y_j$. The term proportional to $(p_{ij}+p_{ji})$ represents attraction, while the term involving $Z$ represents repulsion. Note that $g(r)$ is typically a decreasing function, so $g'(r) < 0$. The attractive term pulls $y_i$ towards $y_j$ (opposite to $u_{ij}$), and the repulsive term pushes $y_i$ away from $y_j$ (along $u_{ij}$).\n\n### Step 2: Far-Neighbor Repulsive Magnitude\n\nIn the far-neighbor regime for a pair $(i, j)$, the high-dimensional similarity is negligible, i.e., $p_{ij} + p_{ji} \\approx 0$. In this case, the attractive part of the force contribution from $y_j$ vanishes. The force simplifies to a purely repulsive component:\n$$\nF_{i \\leftarrow j}^{\\text{far}} \\approx \\left( - \\frac{2 g'(r_{ij})}{Z} \\right) u_{ij}\n$$\nThe radial repulsive magnitude is the magnitude of this force contribution:\n$$\nM(r) = \\left| - \\frac{2 g'(r)}{Z} \\right| = \\frac{2 |g'(r)|}{\\sum_{k \\ne \\ell} g(r_{k\\ell})}\n$$\nWhen analyzing the functional form of the repulsion, $Z$ is treated as a constant factor for a given embedding configuration. Thus, the shape of the repulsive force profile is determined by $|g'(r)|$.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of Specific Kernels\n\nWe now analyze the two specified kernels.\n\n1.  **Student-$t$ kernel**: $g_{\\mathrm{t}}(r) = (1 + r^2)^{-1}$\n    The derivative is $g'_{\\mathrm{t}}(r) = -2r(1 + r^2)^{-2}$.\n    The repulsive magnitude's functional form is $M_{\\mathrm{t}}(r) \\propto |g'_{\\mathrm{t}}(r)| = 2r(1 + r^2)^{-2}$.\n    As $r \\to \\infty$, the asymptotic behavior is $M_{\\mathrm{t}}(r) \\propto r(r^2)^{-2} = r \\cdot r^{-4} = r^{-3}$. This is an algebraic (power-law) decay.\n\n2.  **Laplace kernel**: $g_{\\mathrm{L}}(r) = \\exp(-r)$\n    The derivative is $g'_{\\mathrm{L}}(r) = -\\exp(-r)$.\n    The repulsive magnitude's functional form is $M_{\\mathrm{L}}(r) \\propto |g'_{\\mathrm{L}}(r)| = \\exp(-r)$.\n    As $r \\to \\infty$, this shows an exponential decay.\n\n**Assessment of the Crowding Problem**:\nThe crowding problem in SNE arises when there is insufficient repulsive force to separate points that are far apart in the high-dimensional space. t-SNE mitigates this by using the Student-$t$ kernel, whose algebraic decay ($r^{-3}$) provides a \"heavier tail\" and thus a longer-range repulsive force compared to the exponential decay of a Gaussian kernel used in original SNE.\n\nComparing the Laplace kernel to the Student-$t$ kernel, we find that the repulsive magnitude $M_{\\mathrm{L}}(r) \\propto e^{-r}$ decays exponentially, which is significantly faster than the algebraic decay of $M_{\\mathrm{t}}(r) \\propto r^{-3}$. An exponential decay constitutes a much shorter-range force. Consequently, the Laplace kernel would provide a much weaker repulsion between distant points than the Student-$t$ kernel. This would exacerbate the crowding problem, not alleviate it. The Student-$t$ kernel is superior in this regard due to its heavier-tailed repulsive forces.\n\n### Step 4: Numerical Computations\n\nThe problem requires a series of numerical calculations based on these kernels.\n\n- **Kernels and derivatives**:\n  $|g'_{\\mathrm{t}}(r)| = 2r(1 + r^2)^{-2}$\n  $|g'_{\\mathrm{L}}(r)| = \\exp(-r)$\n\n- **Force-profile ratio**: $R(r) = |g'_{\\mathrm{L}}(r)| / |g'_{\\mathrm{t}}(r)| = \\frac{\\exp(-r)}{2r(1+r^2)^{-2}} = \\frac{\\exp(-r)(1+r^2)^2}{2r}$.\n\n- **Integral difference**: $\\Delta = \\int_{10}^{20} \\exp(-r) \\, dr - \\int_{10}^{20} 2r(1+r^2)^{-2} \\, dr$. These integrals can be computed numerically or analytically.\n  $\\int \\exp(-r) dr = -\\exp(-r)$\n  $\\int 2r(1+r^2)^{-2} dr = -(1+r^2)^{-1}$ (using substitution $u=1+r^2$)\n  $\\Delta = [-\\exp(-r)]_{10}^{20} - [-(1+r^2)^{-1}]_{10}^{20} = (e^{-10} - e^{-20}) - (\\frac{1}{101} - \\frac{1}{401})$.\n\n- **Radii at threshold $\\tau = 10^{-3}$**:\n  $r^\\ast_{\\mathrm{L}}$: Solve $|g'_{\\mathrm{L}}(r)| = e^{-r} = 10^{-3} \\implies r = -\\ln(10^{-3}) = 3\\ln(10)$.\n  $r^\\ast_{\\mathrm{t}}$: Solve $|g'_{\\mathrm{t}}(r)| = \\frac{2r}{(1+r^2)^2} = 10^{-3}$.

The sum thus reduces to:\n$$\n- \\left( \\sum_{j \\neq i} P_{ij} \\frac{1}{q_{ij}} \\frac{\\partial q_{ij}}{\\partial y_i} + \\sum_{j \\neq i} P_{ji} \\frac{1}{q_{ji}} \\frac{\\partial q_{ji}}{\\partial y_i} \\right)\n$$\nSince $P_{ij}=P_{ji}$ and $q_{ij}=q_{ji}$ (and thus $\\partial q_{ij} / \\partial y_i = \\partial q_{ji} / \\partial y_i$), the expression becomes:\n$$\n-2 \\sum_{j \\neq i} P_{ij} \\frac{1}{q_{ij}} \\frac{\\partial q_{ij}}{\\partial y_i}\n$$\nWe compute the derivative of $q_{ij} = (1 + \\|y_i - y_j\\|^2)^{-1}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial q_{ij}}{\\partial y_i} = - (1 + \\|y_i - y_j\\|^2)^{-2} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_i}(\\|y_i - y_j\\|^2) = -q_{ij}^2 \\cdot (2(y_i - y_j))\n$$\nPlugging this back, the first term of the gradient becomes:\n$$\n-2 \\sum_{j \\neq i} P_{ij} \\frac{1}{q_{ij}} (-2q_{ij}^2 (y_i - y_j)) = 4 \\sum_{j \\neq i} P_{ij} q_{ij} (y_i - y_j)\n$$\nSecond term (repulsive forces):\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_i} \\ln(Z) = \\frac{1}{Z} \\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial y_i} = \\frac{1}{Z} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_i} \\left( \\sum_{a \\neq b} q_{ab} \\right)\n$$\nSimilarly, the derivative is non-zero only for terms involving $y_i$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial y_i} = \\sum_{j \\neq i} \\frac{\\partial q_{ij}}{\\partial y_i} + \\sum_{j \\neq i} \\frac{\\partial q_{ji}}{\\partial y_i} = 2 \\sum_{j \\neq i} \\frac{\\partial q_{ij}}{\\partial y_i} = 2 \\sum_{j \\neq i} (-2q_{ij}^2 (y_i - y_j)) = -4 \\sum_{j \\neq i} q_{ij}^2 (y_i - y_j)\n$$\nSo the second term of the gradient is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{Z} \\left( -4 \\sum_{j \\neq i} q_{ij}^2 (y_i - y_j) \\right) = -4 \\sum_{j \\neq i} \\frac{q_{ij}}{Z} q_{ij} (y_i - y_j) = -4 \\sum_{j \\neq i} Q_{ij} q_{ij} (y_i - y_j)\n$$\nCombining both terms, we get the gradient:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y_i} = 4 \\sum_{j \\neq i} P_{ij} q_{ij} (y_i - y_j) - 4 \\sum_{j \\neq i} Q_{ij} q_{ij} (y_i - y_j)\n$$\nThis can be written more compactly as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y_i} = 4 \\sum_{j \\neq i} (P_{ij} - Q_{ij}) q_{ij} (y_i - y_j)\n$$\nTo obtain the final explicit form, we substitute the definitions of $P_{ij}$, $Q_{ij}$, $q_{ij}$, and $W$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y_i} = 4 \\sum_{j \\neq i} \\left( \\frac{w_i p_{j|i} + w_j p_{i|j}}{2 \\sum_{k=1}^N w_k} - \\frac{(1 + \\|y_i - y_j\\|^2)^{-1}}{\\sum_{a \\neq b} (1 + \\|y_a - y_b\\|^2)^{-1}} \\right) \\frac{y_i - y_j}{1 + \\|y_i - y_j\\|^2}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the gradient.\n\nNow, we analyze the effect of the weighting scheme $w_i \\propto 1/f_{c(i)}$, where $f_c$ is the frequency of class $c$. The gradient vector for point $y_i$ is a sum of forces exerted by all other points $y_j$. The term $4 P_{ij} q_{ij} (y_i - y_j)$ represents an attractive force pulling $y_i$ towards $y_j$, with magnitude proportional to $P_{ij}$. The term $-4 Q_{ij} q_{ij} (y_i - y_j)$ represents a repulsive force pushing $y_i$ away from $y_j$.\n\nThe attractive force's magnitude depends on $P_{ij} = \\frac{w_i p_{j|i} + w_j p_{i|j}}{2W}$. With the proposed weighting, points from rare classes receive large weights $w_i$, while points from common classes receive small weights.\nConsider two points $i$ and $j$ from the same rare class. Both $w_i$ and $w_j$ will be large. This increases the value of $P_{ij}$ compared to a non-weighted version (where all $w_i=1$). Consequently, the attractive force between these two points is strengthened.\nConversely, if points $i$ and $j$ belong to the same common class, both $w_i$ and $w_j$ are small, which decreases $P_{ij}$ and weakens their mutual attraction.\n\nThe repulsive forces depend on $Q_{ij}$, which is solely a function of the low-dimensional coordinates $\\{y_k\\}$ and is independent of the weights $\\{w_k\\}$. Therefore, the weighting scheme does not directly alter the repulsive forces.\n\nBy strengthening attraction among rare-class members and weakening it among common-class members, while leaving repulsive forces unchanged, this weighting scheme changes the balance of forces. For a point $i$ in a rare class, the attractive forces from its neighbors (which are likely also in the rare class) become stronger relative to the global repulsive forces. This encourages points from the rare class to form tighter, more distinct clusters in the embedding. For a point in a common class, the attractive forces are weakened, allowing the repulsive forces to have a greater relative effect, which can lead to the common class cluster spreading out more, preventing it from collapsing into a single dense point and dominating the embedding space.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4 \\sum_{j \\neq i} \\left( \\frac{w_i p_{j|i} + w_j p_{i|j}}{2 \\sum_{k=1}^N w_k} - \\frac{\\frac{1}{1 + \\|y_i - y_j\\|^2}}{\\sum_{a \\neq b} \\frac{1}{1 + \\|y_a - y_b\\|^2}} \\right) \\frac{y_i - y_j}{1 + \\|y_i - y_j\\|^2}}\n$$", "id": "3179611"}, {"introduction": "While t-SNE is excellent at revealing local structure, it is not guaranteed to preserve all neighborhoods perfectly, and global distances between clusters can be misleading.

Given a threshold $\\tau \\in [0,1]$, define the set of harmed points as those indices $i$ with $p_i(k) < \\tau$. This can be used to diagnose regions harmed by mechanisms such as early exaggeration or approximation in t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), which are known to potentially disrupt local neighborhoods for some points even when global structure appears reasonable.\n\nUse only the foundational definitions above; do not rely on prepackaged neighbor-preservation or trustworthiness functions. Implement Euclidean distances, deterministic tie-breaking by smaller index, and strict set intersection as stated.

For example, the overall structure must be of the form\n$[[[p^{(1)}_0,\\dots,p^{(1)}_{N-1}],[\\text{harmed}^{(1)}]], [[p^{(2)}_0,\\dots],[\\text{harmed}^{(2)}]], [[p^{(3)}_0,\\dots],[\\text{harmed}^{(3)}]], [[p^{(4)}_0,\\dots],[\\text{harmed}^{(4)}]]]$.", "solution": "The problem requires the computation of a per-point local neighborhood preservation metric for a t-SNE-style embedding. This metric, denoted $p_i(k)$, quantifies the fraction of the $k$-nearest neighbors of a point $x_i$ in a high-dimensional data space $X$ that are also among the $k$-nearest neighbors of its corresponding point $y_i$ in a low-dimensional embedding space $Y$. The objective is to implement a program to calculate the vector of these preservation fractions, $[p_0(k), p_1(k), \\ldots, p_{N-1}(k)]$, and to identify a set of \"harmed\" points for which this preservation fraction falls below a specified tolerance threshold $\\tau$.\n\nThe problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded. All terms are defined with mathematical precision. The data space coordinates are given by the set $X = \\{x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^D\\}_{i=0}^{N-1}$ and the embedding space coordinates by $Y = \\{y_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d\\}_{i=0}^{N-1}$. The distance metric is the standard Euclidean norm, $\\|a-b\\|_2 = \\sqrt{\\sum_{j=1}^m (a_j-b_j)^2}$. A crucial detail is the deterministic tie-breaking rule: when two points are equidistant from a reference point, the point with the smaller index is considered closer. This ensures that the $k$-nearest neighbor sets, $N_k^X(i)$ and $N_k^Y(i)$, are uniquely defined for any point $i$ and any neighborhood size $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, N-1\\}$.\n\nThe per-point neighbor preservation fraction is defined as:\n$$\np_i(k) \\;=\\; \\frac{\\left|\\,N_k^X(i) \\,\\cap\\, N_k^Y(i)\\,\\right|}{k}\n$$\nThis value ranges from $0$ (no neighbors preserved) to $1$ (all $k$ neighbors preserved). The set of harmed points is then defined as all indices $i$ such that $p_i(k) < \\tau$.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure to compute the required outputs for each test case is as follows. For each point $i$ from $0$ to $N-1$:\n\n1.  **Construct Neighbor Lists**:\n    -   For the data space $X$, create a list of tuples $(d_{ij}^X, j)$ for all $j \\neq i$, where $d_{ij}^X = \\|x_i - x_j\\|_2$.\n    -   For the embedding space $Y$, create a list of tuples $(d_{ij}^Y, j)$ for all $j \\neq i$, where $d_{ij}^Y = \\|y_i - y_j\\|_2$.\n\n2.  **Sort and Determine k-NN Sets**:\n    -   Sort the list from the $X$ space based on a primary key of distance $d_{ij}^X$ (ascending) and a secondary key of index $j$ (ascending) to enforce the tie-breaking rule. The set of the first $k$ indices from this sorted list constitutes the $k$-nearest neighbor set $N_k^X(i)$.\n    -   Perform the identical sorting procedure for the list from the $Y$ space to determine the set $N_k^Y(i)$.\n\n3.  **Calculate Preservation Fraction**:\n    -   Compute the intersection of the two sets: $I_i = N_k^X(i) \\cap N_k^Y(i)$.\n    -   Calculate the preservation fraction $p_i(k) = |I_i| / k$.\n\n4.  **Identify Harmed Points**:\n    -   After computing $p_i(k)$ for all $i \\in \\{0, \\ldots, N-1\\}$, compare each $p_i(k)$ to the threshold $\\tau$. The set of harmed indices is $\\{i \\mid p_i(k) < \\tau\\}$.\n\nThis algorithm is applied to each of the four provided test cases.\n\n-   **Test Case 1** ($N=6, k=2, \\tau=1.0$): The embedding $Y^{(1)}$ is a linear scaling of the data $X^{(1)}$, i.e., $y_i = 2x_i$. This transformation preserves the ordering of all inter-point distances. Consequently, for every point $i$, the $k$-nearest neighbors are identical in both spaces: $N_k^X(i) = N_k^Y(i)$. This results in a perfect preservation fraction $p_i(k) = 1.0$ for all $i$. No points are harmed as $p_i(k)$ is not less than $\\tau=1.0$.\n\n-   **Test Case 2** ($N=6, k=2, \\tau=0.75$): The coordinate $y_2=20$ is a significant distortion from the original data's structure, where $x_2=3$ is close to $x_1=1$ and $x_0=0$. This displacement moves point $2$ far away from points $0$ and $1$ in the embedding space $Y$, disrupting their local neighborhoods. Specifically, for point $i=2$, its neighbors in $X$ are $\\{0,1\\}$ but become $\\{3,4\\}$ in $Y$, yielding $p_2(2)=0.0$. Similar disruptions affect the neighborhoods of points $0$ and $1$, leading to $p_0(2)=0.5$ and $p_1(2)=0.5$. The remaining points $3, 4, 5$ are far from the perturbation and retain their neighborhoods, so $p_i(2)=1.0$ for $i \\in \\{3,4,5\\}$. Indices $0, 1, 2$ are harmed as their $p_i(k)$ values are below $\\tau=0.75$.\n\n-   **Test Case 3** ($N=5, k=1, \\tau=1.0$): This case illustrates a local scrambling. In space $X$, the points with indices $0, 1, 2$ form a chain where $1$ is the nearest neighbor of $0$ and $2$, and $0$ is the nearest neighbor of $1$. In space $Y$, point $y_2$ is moved to be very close to $y_0$. This breaks the original neighborhood structure. The nearest neighbor of $y_0$ becomes $y_2$ (not $y_1$), the nearest neighbor of $y_1$ becomes $y_2$ (not $y_0$), and the nearest neighbor of $y_2$ becomes $y_0$ (not $y_1$). In all three cases, the single nearest neighbor is not preserved, so $p_0(1)=p_1(1)=p_2(1)=0.0$. The pair of points $(3,4)$ is distant from this scramble and their mutual nearest-neighbor relationship is preserved, so $p_3(1)=p_4(1)=1.0$. The harmed indices are $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$ as their preservation is less than $\\tau=1.0$.\n\n-   **Test Case 4** ($N=4, k=3, \\tau=1.0$): This is a boundary case where $k=N-1=3$. For any point $i$, its set of neighbors is trivially the set of all other points in the dataset. That is, $N_3^X(i) = N_3^Y(i) = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\} \\setminus \\{i\\}$. The intersection is perfect by definition. Therefore, $p_i(3) = 3/3 = 1.0$ for all $i \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}$.
