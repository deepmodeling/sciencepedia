This state, characterized by a mean-field sensitivity $\\chi = 1$, prevents the exponential growth (explosion) or decay (vanishing) of signal perturbations as they propagate through the network layers.\n\n### Step 1: Derivation of the Mean-Field Sensitivity $\\chi$\n\nWe begin by analyzing the propagation of an infinitesimal perturbation from layer $\\ell-1$ to layer $\\ell$. The pre-activation and activation at layer $\\ell$ are given by:\n$$z^{\\ell} = W^{\\ell} h^{\\ell-1}$$\n$$h^{\\ell} = \\phi(z^{\\ell})$$\nwhere $h^{\\ell-1}$ is the $n$-dimensional activation vector from the previous layer, and $W^{\\ell}$ is the $n \\times n$ weight matrix for layer $\\ell$. The weights $W_{ij}^{\\ell}$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables drawn from a Gaussian distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_w^2/n)$.\n\nAn infinitesimal perturbation $\\delta h^{\\ell-1}$ in the activations of layer $\\ell-1$ induces a perturbation $\\delta z^{\\ell}$ in the pre-activations of layer $\\ell$:\n$$\\delta z^{\\ell} = W^{\\ell} \\delta h^{\\ell-1}$$\nThis, in turn, causes a perturbation $\\delta h^{\\ell}$ in the activations of layer $\\ell$. For infinitesimal perturbations, we can use a first-order Taylor expansion of the activation function $\\phi$:\n$$\\delta h^{\\ell} = \\phi(z^{\\ell} + \\delta z^{\\ell}) - \\phi(z^{\\ell}) \\approx \\phi'(z^{\\ell}) \\odot \\delta z^{\\ell}$$\nwhere $\\odot$ denotes the element-wise (Hadamard) product. In coordinate form, this is $(\\delta h^{\\ell})_i = \\phi'((z^{\\ell})_i) (\\delta z^{\\ell})_i$.\n\nThe mean-field sensitivity $\\chi$ is defined as the ratio of the expected squared norms of the perturbations between consecutive layers in the infinite-width limit ($n \\to \\infty$):\n$$\\chi = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\delta h^{\\ell}\\|^2]}{\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\delta h^{\\ell-1}\\|^2]}$$\nThe expectation $\\mathbb{E}[\\cdot]$ is taken over the distribution of the initial input $h^0$ and the distribution of all network weights.\n\nLet's evaluate the numerator, $\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\delta h^{\\ell}\\|^2]$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\delta h^{\\ell}\\|^2] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} ((\\delta h^{\\ell})_i)^2\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\phi'((z^{\\ell})_i))^2 ((\\delta z^{\\ell})_i)^2\\right]$$\nBy linearity of expectation and noting that all neuron indices $i$ are statistically identical:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\delta h^{\\ell}\\|^2] = n \\, \\mathbb{E}\\left[(\\phi'((z^{\\ell})_i))^2 ((\\delta z^{\\ell})_i)^2\\right]$$\nIn the mean-field (infinite-width) limit, a key phenomenon known as \"chaos\" emerges. The pre-activation $(z^{\\ell})_i = \\sum_j W_{ij}^{\\ell} h_{j}^{\\ell-1}$, being a sum of many weakly correlated terms, becomes a Gaussian random variable by the Central Limit Theorem. Crucially, its distribution becomes independent of the specific realization of the weights that constitute it. This allows us to decouple the expectation over the pre-activation term $\\phi'((z^{\\ell})_i)$ from the perturbation term $(\\delta z^{\\ell})_i$. Let $Z$ be a random variable representing a typical pre-activation, with $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, q_{\\ell})$. The expectation decouples as:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\delta h^{\\ell}\\|^2] = n \\, \\mathbb{E}_{Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, q_{\\ell})}[(\\phi'(Z))^2] \\, \\mathbb{E}[((\\delta z^{\\ell})_i)^2]$$\nNow we evaluate the expectation of the squared pre-activation perturbation, $\\mathbb{E}[((\\delta z^{\\ell})_i)^2]$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[((\\delta z^{\\ell})_i)^2] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} W_{ij}^{\\ell} (\\delta h^{\\ell-1})_j\\right)^2\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{j,k=1}^{n} W_{ij}^{\\ell} W_{ik}^{\\ell} (\\delta h^{\\ell-1})_j (\\delta h^{\\ell-1})_k\\right]$$\nThe weights $W^{\\ell}$ are independent of the perturbation $\\delta h^{\\ell-1}$, so we can separate the expectations. Since the weights are i.i.d. with $\\mathbb{E}[W_{ij}^{\\ell} W_{ik}^{\\ell}] = \\delta_{jk} \\mathrm{Var}(W_{ij}^{\\ell}) = \\delta_{jk} (\\sigma_w^2/n)$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[((\\delta z^{\\ell})_i)^2] = \\sum_{j,k=1}^{n} \\mathbb{E}[W_{ij}^{\\ell} W_{ik}^{\\ell}] \\, \\mathbb{E}[(\\delta h^{\\ell-1})_j (\\delta h^{\\ell-1})_k] = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{\\sigma_w^2}{n} \\mathbb{E}[((\\delta h^{\\ell-1})_j)^2]$$\nAssuming perturbations are uncorrelated across neurons (a consequence of the i.i.d. random structure), and by statistical similarity of all neurons $j$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[((\\delta z^{\\ell})_i)^2] = \\frac{\\sigma_w^2}{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\mathbb{E}[((\\delta h^{\\ell-1})_j)^2] = \\frac{\\sigma_w^2}{n} \\mathbb{E}[\\|\\delta h^{\\ell-1}\\|^2]$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\delta h^{\\ell}\\|^2]$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\delta h^{\\ell}\\|^2] = n \\, \\mathbb{E}_{Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, q_{\\ell})}[(\\phi'(Z))^2] \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_w^2}{n} \\mathbb{E}[\\|\\delta h^{\\ell-1}\\|^2] \\right)$$\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\delta h^{\\ell}\\|^2] = \\sigma_w^2 \\, \\mathbb{E}_{Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, q_{\\ell})}[(\\phi'(Z))^2] \\, \\mathbb{E}[\\|\\delta h^{\\ell-1}\\|^2]$$\nFrom this, we identify the sensitivity $\\chi$:\n$$\\chi = \\sigma_w^2 \\, \\mathbb{E}_{Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, q_{\\ell})}[(\\phi'(Z))^2]$$\n\n### Step 2: Computation of Critical $\\sigma_w^2$ for each Activation Function\n\nThe problem specifies the small-variance regime, $q_{\\ell} \\ll 1$. This implies that the pre-activations $z^{\\ell}$ are concentrated around $0$. We must find the critical value of $\\sigma_w^2$ that results in $\\chi=1$.\n\n**1. Logistic Sigmoid:** $\\phi(x) = \\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-x)}$\nFor a smooth function like the sigmoid, in the limit $q_{\\ell} \\to 0$, the Gaussian distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, q_{\\ell})$ approaches a Dirac delta function at $0$. Thus, the expectation becomes an evaluation at $z=0$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}_{Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, q_{\\ell})}[(\\phi'(Z))^2] \\approx (\\phi'(0))^2$$\nFirst, we find the derivative $\\phi'(x)$:\n$$\\phi'(x) = \\sigma'(x) = \\sigma(x)(1-\\sigma(x)) = \\frac{\\exp(-x)}{(1+\\exp(-x))^2}$$\nAt $x=0$:\n$$\\phi'(0) = \\sigma(0)(1-\\sigma(0)) = \\frac{1}{1+1}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{1+1}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nThe sensitivity is $\\chi \\approx \\sigma_w^2 (\\phi'(0))^2 = \\sigma_w^2 (1/4)^2 = \\sigma_w^2/16$.\nFor marginal stability, $\\chi=1$:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_w^2}{16} = 1 \\implies \\sigma_w^2 = 16$$\n\n**2. Hyperbolic Tangent:** $\\phi(x) = \\tanh(x)$\nThis is also a smooth function, so we use the same approximation as for the sigmoid.\nThe derivative is $\\phi'(x) = 1 - \\tanh^2(x)$.\nAt $x=0$:\n$$\\phi'(0) = 1 - \\tanh^2(0) = 1 - 0^2 = 1$$\nThe sensitivity is $\\chi \\approx \\sigma_w^2 (\\phi'(0))^2 = \\sigma_w^2 (1)^2 = \\sigma_w^2$.\nFor marginal stability, $\\chi=1$:\n$$\\sigma_w^2 = 1$$\nThis is the well-known Glorot/Xavier initialization condition.\n\n**3. Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU):** $\\phi(x) = \\mathrm{ReLU}(x) = \\max\\{0, x\\}$\nThe ReLU function is not differentiable at $x=0$. Its derivative is the Heaviside step function, $\\phi'(x) = H(x)$, which is $1$ for $x0$ and $0$ for $x0$. We cannot use a Taylor expansion around $x=0$. Instead, we must compute the expectation $\\mathbb{E}[(\\phi'(Z))^2]$ directly.\nLet $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, q_{\\ell})$. The derivative squared is $(\\phi'(Z))^2 = (H(Z))^2$. Since $H(Z)$ takes values in $\\{0, 1\\}$, we have $(H(Z))^2 = H(Z)$.\n$$\\mathbb{E}[(\\phi'(Z))^2] = \\mathbb{E}[H(Z)] = P(Z  0)$$\nSince the Gaussian distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, q_{\\ell})$ is symmetric about its mean of $0$, the probability of a draw being positive is exactly $1/2$.\n$$P(Z  0) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi q_{\\ell}}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z^2}{2q_{\\ell}}\\right) dz = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThis result is independent of the variance $q_{\\ell}$ (as long as $q_{\\ell}0$).\nThe sensitivity is $\\chi = \\sigma_w^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}$.\nFor marginal stability, $\\chi=1$:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_w^2}{2} = 1 \\implies \\sigma_w^2 = 2$$\nThis is the well-known He initialization condition.\n\nThe three critical values of $\\sigma_w^2$ for $\\phi = \\sigma$, $\\tanh$, and $\\mathrm{ReLU}$ are $16$, $1$, and $2$, respectively.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n16  1  2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3094645"}, {"introduction": "While proper initialization sets the stage, the choice of activation function has profound consequences during training.

I will now provide the full solution.\n\n### 1. Theoretical Framework\n\nThe problem investigates a single-neuron model defined by the pre-activation function $z = w^\\top x + b$ and the activation function $y_{\\text{hat}} = g(z)$, where $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ is the input, $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ are the weights, and $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is the bias. The model is trained to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss, $L = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N (y_{\\text{hat},i} - y_i)^2$, using full-batch gradient descent.\n\nA curriculum is introduced, where for each epoch $e$, the input $x_i$ is scaled by a factor $s_e$. The pre-activation at epoch $e$ for sample $i$ is therefore $z_i^{(e)} = w^\\top(s_e x_i) + b$. The parameters are updated according to the rules:\n$$ w \\leftarrow w - \\eta \\nabla_w L $$\n$$ b \\leftarrow b - \\eta \\nabla_b L $$\nwhere $\\eta$ is the learning rate.\n\n### 2. Gradient Derivation\n\nTo understand the effect of the curriculum, we derive the gradients of the loss function $L$ with respect to the parameters $w$ and $b$. Using the chain rule for a single sample $i$ at epoch $e$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial L_i}{\\partial w} = \\frac{\\partial L_i}{\\partial y_{\\text{hat},i}} \\frac{\\partial y_{\\text{hat},i}}{\\partial z_i^{(e)}} \\frac{\\partial z_i^{(e)}}{\\partial w} $$\nThe components are:\n- $\\frac{\\partial L_i}{\\partial y_{\\text{hat},i}} = 2(y_{\\text{hat},i} - y_i) = 2(g(z_i^{(e)}) - y_i)$\n- $\\frac{\\partial y_{\\text{hat},i}}{\\partial z_i^{(e)}} = g'(z_i^{(e)})$\n- $\\frac{\\partial z_i^{(e)}}{\\partial w} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w} (w^\\top (s_e x_i) + b) = s_e x_i$\n\nAveraging over the batch of $N$ samples, the gradient for the weight vector $w$ is:\n$$ \\nabla_w L = \\frac{2s_e}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (g(z_i^{(e)}) - y_i) g'(z_i^{(e)}) x_i $$\n\nSimilarly, for the bias $b$, the derivative of the pre-activation is $\\frac{\\partial z_i^{(e)}}{\\partial b} = 1$. The gradient for the bias $b$ is:\n$$ \\nabla_b L = \\frac{2}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (g(z_i^{(e)}) - y_i) g'(z_i^{(e)}) $$\n\nThe key observation is that the curriculum scale $s_e$ acts as a direct multiplier on the weight gradient $\\nabla_w L$, but not on the bias gradient $\\nabla_b L$. Furthermore, $s_e$ influences the value of the pre-activation $z_i^{(e)}$, which in turn affects the crucial derivative term $g'(z_i^{(e)})$.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Activation Function Derivatives\n\nThe term $g'(z)$ determines how much signal from the error is propagated back to the parameters. Its behavior, especially for large $|z|$, is critical.\n\n- **Sigmoid (logistic) function, $\\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$**:\n  Its derivative is $\\sigma'(z) = \\sigma(z)(1 - \\sigma(z))$. For large positive or negative $z$, $\\sigma(z)$ approaches $1$ or $0$, respectively. In both cases, the product $\\sigma(z)(1 - \\sigma(z))$ approaches $0$. This phenomenon, where the gradient becomes extremely small in the \"saturated\" regions of the function, is known as the vanishing gradient problem.\n\n- **Hyperbolic Tangent function, $\\tanh(z)$**:\n  Its derivative is $\\tanh'(z) = 1 - \\tanh^2(z)$. Similar to the sigmoid, as $|z| \\to \\infty$, $\\tanh(z)$ approaches $\\pm 1$, and its derivative $\\tanh'(z)$ approaches $0$. It also suffers from vanishing gradients due to saturation.\n\n- **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), $\\text{ReLU}(z) = \\max(0, z)$**:\n  Its derivative is $\\text{ReLU}'(z) = 1$ for $z  0$ and $0$ for $z  0$. For any positive input, the gradient is constant and does not vanish. This property prevents saturation on the positive side, allowing gradients to flow unimpeded.\n\n### 4. Prediction of Training Dynamics\n\nThe problem specifies an initial state of $w=0_d$ and $b=5.0$. At the first epoch ($e=0$), the pre-activation for any sample is $z_i^{(0)} = w_0^\\top(s_0 x_i) + b_0 = 0 + 5.0 = 5.0$. This large positive bias immediately places the neuron in a regime where the properties of the activation functions are distinct.\n\n- **Test Cases 1 ($\\sigma$, $\\alpha=3.0$) and 2 ($\\tanh$, $\\alpha=3.0$)**:\n  The initial pre-activation $z=5.0$ is in the saturated region for both sigmoid and tanh.\n  $\\sigma'(5.0) \\approx 0.0066$ and $\\tanh'(5.0) \\approx 0.00018$. These gradients are already very small. The curriculum schedule $s_e = 3.0^e$ causes $z_i^{(e)} = s_e(w^\\top x_i) + b$ to grow even larger (assuming $w$ does not become strongly negative), pushing the neuron deeper into saturation. This will drive $g'(z)$ even closer to zero. While the term $s_e$ in $\\nabla_w L$ grows exponentially, the term $g'(z)$ decays exponentially as $z$ increases. The latter effect is dominant, effectively halting learning. We predict a very small loss reduction for sigmoid, and an even smaller one for tanh, as it saturates more quickly.\n\n- **Test Case 3 (ReLU, $\\alpha=3.0$)**:\n  The initial pre-activation $z=5.0$ is in the active region of ReLU, where $\\text{ReLU}'(z) = 1$. The gradient does not vanish. The weight gradient $\\nabla_w L$ is directly proportional to the large and growing scale factor $s_e$. This acts like a large, increasing learning rate for the weights, which, although potentially unstable, should promote rapid learning, especially given the very small base learning rate $\\eta=10^{-6}$. We predict a significant loss reduction.\n\n- **Test Case 4 ($\\sigma$, $s_e=1$)**:\n  This is a control case. The scale is constant. The neuron is still initialized in a saturated state ($z=5.0$), so learning will be slow due to small gradients. However, unlike Case 1, the pre-activations are not actively pushed further into saturation by a growing $s_e$. We predict a low but non-negligible loss reduction, which should be greater than that in Case 1.\n\n- **Test Case 5 (ReLU, $\\alpha=1.5$)**:\n  Similar to Case 3, ReLU avoids the saturation problem. The curriculum scale $s_e = 1.5^e$ is more moderate. This should still provide a powerful learning signal without the same risk of instability as the $\\alpha=3.0$ case. We predict a significant loss reduction, likely comparable to or even better than Case 3 if the more aggressive scaling there causes optimization issues.\n\nIn summary, the expected order of performance (loss reduction ratio $r$) is $r_2  r_1  r_4  r_3 \\approx r_5$. This experiment is designed to empirically demonstrate the consequences of activation function saturation.\n\n### 5. Algorithmic Implementation\n\nThe solution is implemented in Python using the `numpy` library.\n1.  **Data Generation**: A function generates the fixed dataset $(X, y)$ and teacher vector $v$ based on the specified distributions and random seed.\n2.  **Model Components**: Helper functions are defined for the sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU activations and their respective derivatives. a function for MSE loss is also defined.\n3.  **Training Procedure**: A `train` function encapsulates the core logic. It takes the dataset, activation functions, curriculum schedule, and hyperparameters as input. Inside, it initializes weights and bias. It then iterates for the specified number of epochs. In each epoch, it:\n    a. Calculates the current scale $s_e$.\n    b. Computes the pre-activations $z^{(e)}$ using the scaled inputs.\n    c. Calculates the predictions $y_{\\text{hat}}$ and the activation derivative values $g'(z^{(e)})$.\n    d. Computes the gradients $\\nabla_w L$ and $\\nabla_b L$ using the derived matrix-form expressions.\n    e.

A stable equilibrium corresponds to a local minimum of $L(w)$, which can be identified by analyzing the second derivative $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2L}{\\mathrm{d}w^2}$ or by inspecting the local behavior of $L(w)$.\n\nWe analyze each activation function $\\phi$ separately.\n\n**1. Logistic Sigmoid: $\\phi(z) = \\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-z)}$**\n\nThe sigmoid function has the property $\\sigma(-z) = 1 - \\sigma(z)$.

The only critical point is $w = \\theta$.\n\nFor stability, we evaluate the second derivative at $w=\\theta$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2L}{\\mathrm{d}w^2} = (\\tanh'(w))^2 - (\\tanh(\\theta) - \\tanh(w))\\tanh''(w)\n$$\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2L}{\\mathrm{d}w^2}\\right|_{w=\\theta} = (\\tanh'(\\theta))^2 - (\\tanh(\\theta) - \\tanh(\\theta))\\tanh''(\\theta) = (\\tanh'(\\theta))^2\n$$\nSince $\\theta  0$, $\\tanh'(\\theta)  0$, and so $(\\tanh'(\\theta))^2  0$. This indicates a local minimum at $w=\\theta$. Therefore, $w^\\star = \\theta$ is a stable equilibrium point.\n\n**3.

Since $\\theta  0$, this critical point lies in the region $w0$. The second derivative is $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2L}{\\mathrm{d}w^2} = \\frac{1}{2}  0$, so $w = \\theta$ is a local minimum and thus a stable equilibrium.\n\nCase (ii): $w  0$. Here, $\\mathrm{ReLU}(w) = 0$ and $\\mathrm{ReLU}(-w) = -w$.\n$$\nL(w) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left[ (\\theta - 0)^2 + (-w)^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{4}(\\theta^2 + w^2)\n$$\nThe derivative is $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}L}{\\mathrm{d}w} = \\frac{1}{4}(2w) = \\frac{w}{2}$. For $w  0$, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}L}{\\mathrm{d}w}  0$, so there are no critical points in this region. The gradient flow is $\\dot{w} = -L'(w) = -w/2  0$, meaning the state $w$ moves towards $0$.\n\nCase (iii): $w=0$. The function $L(w)$ is not differentiable at $w=0$. We analyze the subgradient. A point $w^\\star$ is a critical point if $0 \\in \\partial L(w^\\star)$, where $\\partial L$ is the subdifferential.\nThe subdifferential at a point of non-differentiability is the interval between the left and right derivatives.\nRight derivative: $\\lim_{w\\to 0^+} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}L}{\\mathrm{d}w} = \\lim_{w\\to 0^+} \\left[-\\frac{1}{2}(\\theta - w)\\right] = -\\frac{\\theta}{2}$.\nLeft derivative: $\\lim_{w\\to 0^-} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}L}{\\mathrm{d}w} = \\lim_{w\\to 0^-} \\frac{w}{2} = 0$.\nThe subdifferential at $w=0$ is $\\partial L(0) = [-\\frac{\\theta}{2}, 0]$. Since $0 \\in [-\\frac{\\theta}{2}, 0]$ (as $\\theta0$), $w=0$ is a critical point.\n\nTo assess the stability of $w=0$, we examine the potential $L(w)$ in its neighborhood.\n$L(0) = \\frac{1}{4}(\\theta^2)$.\nFor a small $w  0$, $L(w) = \\frac{1}{4}(\\theta-w)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}(\\theta^2 - 2\\theta w + w^2)$.\nThe difference is $L(w) - L(0) = \\frac{1}{4}(-2\\theta w + w^2) = \\frac{w}{4}(w-2\\theta)$.\nFor $w \\in (0, 2\\theta)$, this difference is negative, meaning $L(w)  L(0)$. A point cannot be a stable equilibrium if there are nearby points with lower potential energy to which the system can evolve. Since for any small perturbation $\\epsilon0$, $L(\\epsilon)  L(0)$, the system will move away from $w=0$ (specifically, towards $w=\\theta$). Therefore, $w=0$ is an unstable equilibrium.\n\nThe only stable equilibrium for the ReLU activation function is $w^\\star = \\theta$.\n\n**Summary of Results**\n- For $\\phi = \\sigma(z)$, the stable equilibrium is $w^\\star = \\theta$.\n- For $\\phi = \\tanh(z)$, the stable equilibrium is $w^\\star = \\theta$.\n- For $\\phi = \\mathrm{ReLU}(z)$, the stable equilibrium is $w^\\star = \\theta$.\n\nThe ordered triple of stable equilibrium values $w^{\\star}$ in the order $(\\sigma, \\tanh, \\mathrm{ReLU})$ is $(\\theta, \\theta, \\theta)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\theta  \\theta  \\theta\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3094674"}]}
