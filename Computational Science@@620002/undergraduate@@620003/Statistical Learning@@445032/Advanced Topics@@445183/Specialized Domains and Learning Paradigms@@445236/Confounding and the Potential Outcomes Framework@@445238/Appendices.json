We start with the relationship between the observed risk ratio ($\\widehat{RR}$) and the true causal risk ratio ($RR^{\\text{causal}}$). For $\\widehat{RR} > 1$, confounding can inflate the true effect, such that $\\widehat{RR} = RR^{\\text{causal}} \\times B$, where $B$ is a bias factor. To \"explain away\" the effect means to find a confounding scenario where the true causal risk ratio is 1, implying the bias factor $B$ must be equal to the observed risk ratio $\\widehat{RR}$.\n\nThe E-value definition requires finding the minimum strength $E$ for the confounder associations that can achieve this bias. Let $RR_{AU}$ be the risk ratio for the association between the confounder $U$ and the treatment $A$, and $RR_{UY}$ be the risk ratio for the association between the confounder $U$ and the outcome $Y$. The E-value is defined under the \"worst-case\" scenario where we set $RR_{AU} = RR_{UY} = E$.\n\nA key result in sensitivity analysis provides a sharp upper bound on the bias factor $B$ that can be produced by a confounder with these properties. To find the E-value, we set this maximal bias equal to the observed risk ratio $\\widehat{RR}$ and solve for $E$. The specific relationship is:\n$$ \\widehat{RR} = \\frac{E^2}{2E - 1} $$\nOur task is to invert this equation to express $E$ as a function of $\\widehat{RR}$. We can rearrange the equation into a standard quadratic form:\n$$ \\widehat{RR} (2E - 1) = E^2 $$\n$$ 2E\\widehat{RR} - \\widehat{RR} = E^2 $$\n$$ E^2 - 2\\widehat{RR} \\cdot E + \\widehat{RR} = 0 $$\nThis is a quadratic equation in the variable $E$. We can solve for $E$ using the quadratic formula, $E = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=1$, $b=-2\\widehat{RR}$, and $c=\\widehat{RR}$.\n$$ E = \\frac{2\\widehat{RR} \\pm \\sqrt{(-2\\widehat{RR})^2 - 4(1)(\\widehat{RR})}}{2(1)} $$\n$$ E = \\frac{2\\widehat{RR} \\pm \\sqrt{4\\widehat{RR}^2 - 4\\widehat{RR}}}{2} $$\n$$ E = \\frac{2\\widehat{RR} \\pm 2\\sqrt{\\widehat{RR}^2 - \\widehat{RR}}}{2} $$\n$$ E = \\widehat{RR} \\pm \\sqrt{\\widehat{RR}^2 - \\widehat{RR}} $$\nBy definition, a risk ratio must be non-negative, and for confounding to explain away an effect where $\\widehat{RR} > 1$, the confounder strength $E$ must be greater than 1. The smaller root, $\\widehat{RR} - \\sqrt{\\widehat{RR}^2 - \\widehat{RR}}$, is always less than or equal to 1. Therefore, we must take the larger root to find the minimum required confounding strength.\n\nThe closed-form expression for the E-value is:\n$$ E\\text{-value} = \\widehat{RR} + \\sqrt{\\widehat{RR}(\\widehat{RR}-1)} $$\n\n### Calculation\nNow, we compute the E-value for an observed risk ratio $\\widehat{RR} = 1.8$.\n$$ E = 1.8 + \\sqrt{1.8(1.8 - 1)} $$\n$$ E = 1.8 + \\sqrt{1.8 \\times 0.8} $$\n$$ E = 1.8 + \\sqrt{1.44} $$\n$$ E = 1.8 + 1.2 $$\n$$ E = 3.0 $$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, the E-value is $3.000$.\n\n### Interpretation\nAn E-value of $3.000$ for an observed risk ratio of $1.8$ means that for an unmeasured confounder to fully explain away this observed association (i.e., to reduce the true causal risk ratio to $1.0$), it would need to be associated with both the treatment and the outcome with risk ratios of at least $3.0$ each, above and beyond any measured covariates. For instance, the confounder would have to increase the risk of the outcome by a factor of $3.0$ and also be $3.0$ times more prevalent in the treated group than the untreated group (or vice-versa). The plausibility of the confounding explanation can then be assessed by comparing this required strength of association ($E=3.0$) with the strengths of known and established risk factors for the given treatment and outcome.
