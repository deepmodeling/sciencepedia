This exercise is designed to highlight the potential biases introduced by such a naive approach.

Some patients are lost to follow-up or do not experience the event by the end of the observation period; these are recorded as censored observations.\n\nThe observed times for the two groups are as follows, where a + symbol indicates a censored observation:\n- **Group A (New Agent):** 21, 26, 31, 35+, 35+, 35+, 35+, 35+\n- **Group B (Standard Treatment):** 5, 10, 15, 18, 22, 27, 32, 38\n\nA data analyst proposes two different methods to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the survival distributions between the two groups.\n1.

This hands-on coding challenge introduces the stratified log-rank test, a crucial extension that allows us to adjust for such confounders. By implementing a stratified analysis based on a covariate, you will learn a powerful technique to isolate the treatment effect, thereby ensuring a more accurate and robust comparison of survival distributions in complex, real-world scenarios [@problem_id:3185163].", "problem": "You are given two-treatment survival data with right censoring and a single continuous covariate $Z$ that is suspected to modify hazards nonlinearly. Your task is to implement a stratified log-rank comparison of the two treatments, where strata are formed by a nonlinear transformation of $Z$, and then to assess whether any residual treatment differences remain within individual strata.\n\nFundamental base and assumptions:\n- Let the survival function be $S(t)$ and the hazard function be $h(t)$. For each stratum, let the risk set just before time $t$ be $R(t)$, with $n(t)$ individuals at risk and $n_{1}(t)$ at risk in the treatment group labeled $1$.\n- Under the null hypothesis of equal hazards between the two treatments within each stratum, at any distinct event time $t$ (conditional on $R(t)$ and the total number of events $d(t)$ at that time), the number of events attributed to treatment $1$ follows the without-replacement hypergeometric law. Consequently, at each event time, the expected number of treatment-$1$ events is proportional to $n_{1}(t)$, and the variability reflects sampling without replacement (finite population correction). Tied event times must be handled using this without-replacement mechanism.\n\nWhat to compute:\n- Nonlinear stratification: For each test case, transform covariates by $f(Z) = Z^{2}$ and split the data into exactly two strata by the sample median of $f(Z)$ within that test case. Individuals with $f(Z)$ less than or equal to the median belong to the lower stratum, and those with $f(Z)$ strictly greater than the median belong to the upper stratum.\n- Within each stratum, construct a log-rank type score by aggregating across distinct event times $t$ in that stratum: compare the observed count of events in treatment $1$ at time $t$ to its conditional expectation under the null (based on the hypergeometric law), and aggregate the corresponding conditional variances that incorporate the without-replacement finite-sample correction for ties. Let the resulting stratum-level contributions be the sum of observed minus expected, and its variance.\n- Form the overall stratified statistic by summing the observed-minus-expected contributions and their variances across the two strata, and then constructing a single quadratic form that, under the null, is asymptotically chi-square with one degree of freedom. Also compute, for each individual stratum, its own one-degree-of-freedom quadratic form and p-value.\n- Significance threshold: use level $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n- Residual within-stratum assessment: produce a boolean that is true if and only if at least one stratum’s within-stratum p-value is strictly less than $\\alpha$.\n\nImplementation details to respect:\n- Right-censoring: at an event time $t$, the risk set must include all individuals with observed times greater than or equal to $t$. If an individual is censored at time $t$, they are counted in the risk set at time $t$ but contribute no events at $t$.\n- Ties at an event time $t$ must be treated using the without-replacement hypergeometric model for the distribution of events across treatment groups and the corresponding finite population correction in the variance.\n- If a stratum has zero information (for example, no events or degenerate risk sets that make the variance zero), its variance contribution is treated as zero. In such a stratum, the within-stratum statistic is defined to be zero and the p-value to be one.\n\nTest suite:\nImplement your program to compute the required outputs for the following three test cases.

Within-Stratum Log-Rank Calculation**\n\nFor each stratum, we calculate the components of the log-rank test. We iterate through the unique event times observed *within that stratum*. At each distinct event time $t_j$:\n- **Risk Set:** Identify all subjects in the stratum who are \"at risk\" (their observed time is $\\ge t_j$). Let the total number at risk be $n_j$, and the number at risk in the treatment group (group 1) be $n_{1j}$.\n- **Events:** Count the total number of events occurring at time $t_j$, which we call $d_j$. Also count the number of these events that are in the treatment group, $d_{1j}$.\n- **Observed vs. Expected:** The core of the test is comparing the observed events $d_{1j}$ to the expected events under the null hypothesis, $E_j = d_j \\frac{n_{1j}}{n_j}$. The score for this time point is $d_{1j} - E_j$.\n- **Variance:** The variance of this score, accounting for ties (when $d_j > 1$), is calculated using the hypergeometric variance formula: $V_j = d_j \\frac{n_{1j}}{n_j} (1 - \\frac{n_{1j}}{n_j}) \\frac{n_j - d_j}{n_j - 1}$. If $n_j \\le 1$, the variance is 0.\n\n**3. Aggregation and Statistic Construction**\n\nThe scores and variances are summed up within each stratum to get a stratum-level score $(O_k - E_k)$ and variance $V_k$.\n\n- **Overall Stratified Test:** The scores and variances from both strata are summed to get the overall score $O-E = \\sum_k (O_k - E_k)$ and overall variance $V = \\sum_k V_k$. The final stratified chi-square statistic is $S = \\frac{(O - E)^2}{V}$. This statistic is compared to a $\\chi^2$ distribution with 1 degree of freedom to get the overall p-value $P$.\n- **Within-Stratum Assessment:** For each stratum $k$, a local chi-square statistic is calculated as $S_k = \\frac{(O_k - E_k)^2}{V_k}$. The corresponding p-value $P_k$ is found. The boolean flag $B$ is set to `True` if any $P_k  0.05$. If a stratum has $V_k=0$, it provides no information, so its p-value is taken as 1.0.\n\nThe Python code in the answer implements these steps. For each test case, it calculates the required list $[S, P, B]$, rounds the floating-point numbers to six decimal places, and assembles the results into the required output format.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import chi2\n\ndef stratified_log_rank(times: np.ndarray, events: np.ndarray, groups: np.ndarray, z: np.ndarray) - list:\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a stratified log-rank test on survival data.\n\n    Args:\n        times: Array of observed times.\n        events: Array of event indicators (1=event, 0=censored).\n        groups: Array of treatment group labels (0 or 1).\n        z: Array of continuous covariate values.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list containing [S, P, B]:\n        S: The overall stratified chi-square statistic.\n        P: The corresponding p-value.\n        B: A boolean indicating if any stratum has p  0.05.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- 1.
