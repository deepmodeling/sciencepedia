It is a complete, consistent, and formalizable problem within the specified scientific domain.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation and Solution\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts: first, the theoretical derivation of the influence function and variance, and second, the numerical computation using the provided dataset.\n\n**Part 1: Theoretical Derivation**\n\nThe primary goal is to find an asymptotic representation for $\\hat{S}(t) - S(t)$ which reveals the influence of each observation. This leads to the influence function and a formula for the asymptotic variance.\n\n**1.1. Influence Function for the Nelson-Aalen Estimator**\n\nThe Nelson-Aalen (NA) estimator for the cumulative hazard function $\\Lambda(t) = \\int_0^t \\lambda(u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u$ is given by a Stieltjes integral:\n$$\n\\hat{\\Lambda}_{NA}(t) = \\int_0^t \\frac{\\mathrm{d}N(u)}{Y(u)} = \\sum_{j: t_j \\leq t, \\delta_j=1} \\frac{1}{Y(t_j)}\n$$\nwhere $t_j$ are the distinct event times.\n\nTo understand the properties of $\\hat{\\Lambda}_{NA}(t)$, we use counting process theory. For each subject $i$, we define the counting process $N_i(t) = \\mathbf{1}\\{X_i \\leq t, \\Delta_i=1\\}$ and the at-risk process $Y_i(t) = \\mathbf{1}\\{X_i \\geq t\\}$. The process $M_i(t) = N_i(t) - \\int_0^t Y_i(u)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda(u)$ is a zero-mean martingale. The aggregate processes are $N(t) = \\sum_i N_i(t)$ and $Y(t) = \\sum_i Y_i(t)$, and the aggregate martingale is $M(t) = \\sum_i M_i(t)$.\n\nWe can write the difference $\\hat{\\Lambda}_{NA}(t) - \\Lambda(t)$ as:\n$$\n\\hat{\\Lambda}_{NA}(t) - \\Lambda(t) = \\int_0^t \\frac{\\mathrm{d}N(u)}{Y(u)} - \\int_0^t \\mathrm{d}\\Lambda(u) = \\int_0^t \\frac{\\mathrm{d}N(u) - Y(u)\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda(u)}{Y(u)}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\mathrm{d}N(u) = \\mathrm{d}M(u) + Y(u)\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda(u)$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\hat{\\Lambda}_{NA}(t) - \\Lambda(t) = \\int_0^t \\frac{\\mathrm{d}M(u)}{Y(u)} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\int_0^t \\frac{\\mathrm{d}M_i(u)}{Y(u)}\n$$\nFor large $n$, the law of large numbers implies $Y(u)/n \\to \\pi(u) = \\mathbb{P}(X_i \\geq u) = S(u-)P(C_i \\geq u-)$. We can thus approximate $Y(u)$ by $n\\pi(u)$.\n$$\n\\hat{\\Lambda}_{NA}(t) - \\Lambda(t) \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^n \\int_0^t \\frac{\\mathrm{d}M_i(u)}{n\\pi(u)} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\int_0^t \\frac{\\mathrm{d}M_i(u)}{\\pi(u)}\n$$\nThis representation shows that $\\hat{\\Lambda}_{NA}(t) - \\Lambda(t)$ is asymptotically a sum of i.i.d. terms. The influence function (IF) for the $i$-th subject on $\\hat{\\Lambda}_{NA}(t)$ is the term inside the sum:\n$$\nIF_i(\\hat{\\Lambda}_{NA}, t) = \\int_0^t \\frac{\\mathrm{d}M_i(u)}{\\pi(u)} = \\int_0^t \\frac{\\mathrm{d}N_i(u) - Y_i(u)\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda(u)}{\\pi(u)}\n= \\frac{\\Delta_i \\mathbf{1}\\{X_i \\leq t\\}}{\\pi(X_i)} - \\int_0^t \\frac{Y_i(u)\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda(u)}{\\pi(u)}\n$$\n\n**1.2. From Cumulative Hazard to Survival Function**\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier estimator is defined by the product-limit formula:\n$$\n\\hat{S}(t) = \\prod_{u \\leq t} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}N(u)}{Y(u)}\\right)\n$$\nThe true survival function can be expressed as a product-integral of the cumulative hazard: $S(t) = \\prod_{u \\leq t}(1 - \\mathrm{d}\\Lambda(u))$. To find the influence function for $\\hat{S}(t)$, we linearize the estimator. A common method is to first linearize the logarithm:\n$$\n\\ln \\hat{S}(t) = \\sum_{u \\leq t} \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}N(u)}{Y(u)}\\right)\n$$\nUsing a Taylor expansion $\\ln(1-x) \\approx -x$ for small $x$, and noting that $\\mathrm{d}N(u)/Y(u)$ is small, we have:\n$$\n\\ln \\hat{S}(t) \\approx \\sum_{u \\leq t} -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}N(u)}{Y(u)} = -\\hat{\\Lambda}_{NA}(t)\n$$\nSimilarly, $\\ln S(t) = \\sum_{u \\leq t} \\ln(1 - \\mathrm{d}\\Lambda(u)) \\approx -\\int_0^t \\mathrm{d}\\Lambda(u) = -\\Lambda(t)$.\nThis gives the approximation $\\ln \\hat{S}(t) - \\ln S(t) \\approx -(\\hat{\\Lambda}_{NA}(t) - \\Lambda(t))$.\nExponentiating and linearizing $\\exp(x) \\approx 1+x$ yields:\n$$\n\\hat{S}(t) = S(t) \\exp(\\ln \\hat{S}(t) - \\ln S(t)) \\approx S(t) (1 + \\ln \\hat{S}(t) - \\ln S(t)) \\approx S(t) (1 - (\\hat{\\Lambda}_{NA}(t) - \\Lambda(t)))\n$$\nRearranging gives the key relationship:\n$$\n\\hat{S}(t) - S(t) \\approx -S(t) (\\hat{\\Lambda}_{NA}(t) - \\Lambda(t))\n$$\nThis is an application of the functional delta method, where the mapping is $\\phi(\\Lambda) = \\exp(-\\Lambda(t))$ for the continuous case, whose derivative is $-\\exp(-\\Lambda(t))=-S(t)$. A more rigorous argument based on the Duhamel equation confirms this result.\n\nSubstituting the influence function representation for $\\hat{\\Lambda}_{NA}(t)$, we obtain the influence function for $\\hat{S}(t)$:\n$$\nIF_i(\\hat{S}, t) = -S(t) IF_i(\\hat{\\Lambda}_{NA}, t) = -S(t) \\int_0^t \\frac{\\mathrm{d}M_i(u)}{\\pi(u)}\n$$\n\n**1.3. Asymptotic Variance and Greenwood's Formula**\n\nThe asymptotic variance of $\\sqrt{n}(\\hat{S}(t) - S(t))$ is given by the variance of the influence function, $\\mathbb{E}[IF_i(\\hat{S},t)^2]$.\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\sqrt{n}(\\hat{S}(t)-S(t))) \\approx \\mathbb{E}[IF_i(\\hat{S},t)^2] = S(t)^2 \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\left(\\int_0^t \\frac{\\mathrm{d}M_i(u)}{\\pi(u)}\\right)^2 \\right]\n$$\nBy properties of stochastic integrals with respect to martingales, the variance is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^t \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\langle M_i \\rangle_u}{\\pi(u)^2}\\right] = \\int_0^t \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[\\mathrm{d}\\langle M_i \\rangle_u]}{\\pi(u)^2}\n$$\nThe predictable variation is $\\mathrm{d}\\langle M_i \\rangle_u = Y_i(u)(1-\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda(u))\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda(u)$, and its expectation is $\\pi(u)(1-\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda(u))\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda(u)$.\nSo, the asymptotic variance of $\\sqrt{n}(\\hat{S}(t)-S(t))$ is:\n$$\nS(t)^2 \\int_0^t \\frac{(1-\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda(u))\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda(u)}{\\pi(u)}\n$$\nTo estimate this variance from data, we replace the theoretical quantities with their empirical counterparts. The integral becomes a sum over observed event times $t_j$. We use $d_j/Y_j$ to estimate $\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda(t_j)$ and $Y_j/n$ to estimate $\\pi(t_j)$. The estimator for the variance of $\\hat{S}(t)$ (not scaled by $\\sqrt{n}$) is:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{S}(t)) = \\frac{1}{n} \\hat{S}(t)^2 \\left( \\sum_{j: t_j \\leq t} \\frac{(1-d_j/Y_j)(d_j/Y_j)}{Y_j/n} \\right) = \\hat{S}(t)^2 \\sum_{j: t_j \\leq t} \\frac{d_j(Y_j-d_j)}{Y_j^3}\n$$\nThis formula is asymptotically equivalent to Greenwood's formula. Greenwood's formula, derived from a finite-sample (hypergeometric) argument, is generally preferred for its better performance in smaller samples. It is given by:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{Var}}_{GW}(\\hat{S}(t)) = \\hat{S}(t)^2 \\sum_{j: t_j \\leq t} \\frac{d_j}{Y_j(Y_j - d_j)}\n$$\nFor large $Y_j$, $Y_j-d_j \\approx Y_j$, so $\\frac{d_j}{Y_j(Y_j-d_j)} \\approx \\frac{d_j}{Y_j^2}$, which differs from the martingale-based estimate by a factor of $(Y_j-d_j)/Y_j$. Both approaches lead to asymptotically equivalent results, justifying the use of Greenwood's formula as the \"classical large-sample variance\".\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Computation**\n\nWe compute $\\hat{S}(8.0)$ and its variance for the given data. The ordered observed times are $1.5_E, 2.0_C, 3.0_E, 4.0_E, 5.5_C, 6.0_E, 7.0_C, 7.5_E, 8.0_E, 9.0_C$, where $E$ denotes an event and $C$ denotes censoring. The distinct event times are $1.5, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 7.5, 8.0$. Since all event times are unique, the number of events $d_j$ at each event time $t_j$ is $1$.\n\nWe construct the Kaplan-Meier table:\n- $t_j$: distinct event time.\n- $Y_j = Y(t_j)$: number of subjects at risk just before time $t_j$.\n- $d_j$: number of events at time $t_j$.\n\n| Event Time $t_j$ | At Risk $Y_j$ | Events $d_j$ | Survival Factor $(1-d_j/Y_j)$ | KM Estimate $\\hat{S}(t_j)$ | Greenwood Term $\\frac{d_j}{Y_j(Y_j-d_j)}$ |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| $1.5$ | $10$ | $1$ | $1 - \\frac{1}{10} = 0.9$ | $1.0 \\times 0.9 = 0.90$ | $\\frac{1}{10(9)} = \\frac{1}{90}$ |\n| $3.0$ | $8$ | $1$ | $1 - \\frac{1}{8} = 0.875$ | $0.90 \\times 0.875 = 0.7875$ | $\\frac{1}{8(7)} = \\frac{1}{56}$ |\n| $4.0$ | $7$ | $1$ | $1 - \\frac{1}{7} \\approx 0.8571$ | $0.7875 \\times \\frac{6}{7} \\approx 0.675$ | $\\frac{1}{7(6)} = \\frac{1}{42}$ |\n| $6.0$ | $5$ | $1$ | $1 - \\frac{1}{5} = 0.8$ | $0.675 \\times 0.8 = 0.54$ | $\\frac{1}{5(4)} = \\frac{1}{20}$ |\n| $7.5$ | $3$ | $1$ | $1 - \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.6667$ | $0.54 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 0.36$ | $\\frac{1}{3(2)} = \\frac{1}{6}$ |\n| $8.0$ | $2$ | $1$ | $1 - \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$ | $0.36 \\times 0.5 = 0.18$ | $\\frac{1}{2(1)} = \\frac{1}{2}$ |\n\n**2.1.

The power of this model, however, rests on the crucial proportional hazards assumption—that the effect of a covariate is constant over time. This exercise challenges you to think critically about model diagnostics, exploring how to use Schoenfeld residuals to test this key assumption and how to select the right tools for assessing model fit, particularly in the common scenario of heavy censoring [@problem_id:3107112].", "problem": "A clinical study follows $n=200$ patients with covariate vector $X_i$ and event time $T_i$. Because follow-up ends at a fixed administrative time $C_i$, many events are not observed; the observed time is $U_i = \\min(T_i, C_i)$ and the indicator $\\delta_i = \\mathbf{1}\\{T_i \\le C_i\\}$ encodes right-censoring. In this study, approximately $80\\%$ of patients are right-censored, i.e., $\\delta_i=0$ for about $80\\%$ of $i$.\n\nAssume the Cox proportional hazards (PH) model with hazard $\\lambda(t \\mid X_i) = \\lambda_0(t)\\exp(X_i^\\top \\beta)$ is fit, and you wish to use residual-based diagnostics to assess two aspects: (i) the suitability of residuals for detecting covariate functional form under heavy right-censoring (contrasting martingale versus deviance residuals), and (ii) whether a particular coefficient $\\beta_k$ might vary with time, i.e., $\\beta_k(t)$, using Schoenfeld residuals.\n\nBased on the foundational definitions of right-censoring, the hazard function, and the Cox PH model, choose the option that correctly contrasts the behavior of martingale versus deviance residuals under heavy right-censoring and proposes a scientifically valid diagnostic to detect time-varying effects $\\beta_k(t)$ with Schoenfeld residuals.\n\nA. Under heavy right-censoring, martingale residuals are highly skewed with a long negative tail and are bounded above by $1$, so deviance residuals are preferred because they approximately symmetrize the martingale residuals and stabilize their scale. To diagnose a time-varying effect for covariate $X_k$, compute scaled Schoenfeld residuals at event times and regress them on a function of time, such as $\\log(t)$, testing for a nonzero slope; a significant trend indicates that $\\beta_k(t)$ varies with time.\n\nB. Under heavy right-censoring, deviance residuals are more skewed than martingale residuals because many individuals have $0$ observed events; therefore, martingale residuals are preferred. To diagnose time-varying effects, average Schoenfeld residuals across all individuals at each follow-up time and test whether their mean is zero; deviations from zero imply no time-varying effects.\n\nC. Under heavy right-censoring, both martingale and deviance residuals are symmetric with mean zero, so the choice between them does not matter. To diagnose time-varying effects, regress Schoenfeld residuals for $X_k$ on the covariate $X_k$ itself and test whether the slope differs from zero; a nonzero slope indicates time variation in $\\beta_k(t)$.\n\nD. Under heavy right-censoring, martingale residuals tend to cluster tightly around zero, but deviance residuals inflate to very large positive values; therefore, deviance residuals should be avoided. To diagnose time-varying effects, compute Schoenfeld residuals at both event times and censored times and test for independence from $\\log(t)$.", "solution": "The problem statement poses a valid question within the domain of survival analysis and statistical learning, specifically concerning diagnostic procedures for the Cox proportional hazards model. The setup is standard, the terminology is precise, and the context of heavy censoring is a well-defined and common practical challenge. All elements are scientifically grounded and formalizable. We may therefore proceed to a full solution.\n\nThe problem requires an evaluation of two distinct aspects of residual diagnostics for the Cox model:\n1.  The properties and relative suitability of martingale versus deviance residuals under heavy right-censoring for assessing covariate functional form.\n2.  The correct procedure for using Schoenfeld residuals to test for time-varying coefficients, i.e., violations of the proportional hazards (PH) assumption.\n\n**Part 1: Martingale versus Deviance Residuals**\n\nThe martingale residual for subject $i$ in a Cox model is defined as:\n$$M_i = \\delta_i - \\hat{\\Lambda}(U_i \\mid X_i) = \\delta_i - \\hat{\\Lambda}_0(U_i) \\exp(X_i^\\top \\hat{\\beta})$$\nwhere $\\delta_i$ is the event indicator ($1$ if an event occurred, $0$ if censored), $U_i$ is the observed follow-up time, and $\\hat{\\Lambda}(U_i \\mid X_i)$ is the estimated cumulative hazard for subject $i$ at time $U_i$.\n\nThe range of the martingale residual is $(-\\infty, 1]$.\n-   If subject $i$ is censored at time $U_i$, then $\\delta_i = 0$, and the residual is $M_i = -\\hat{\\Lambda}(U_i \\mid X_i)$. This value is always negative.\n-   If subject $i$ experiences an event at time $U_i$, then $\\delta_i = 1$, and the residual is $M_i = 1 - \\hat{\\Lambda}(U_i \\mid X_i)$. This value is typically positive or close to zero, as the cumulative hazard up to most event times is often less than $1$.\n\nThe problem states that approximately $80\\%$ of subjects are right-censored. This implies that about $80\\%$ of the martingale residuals will be negative (corresponding to $\\delta_i = 0$), while only about $20\\%$ correspond to events ($\\delta_i = 1$). This imbalance leads to a highly skewed distribution of martingale residuals, with a mass of negative values and a long negative tail. Such skewed residuals are difficult to interpret visually, for instance, when plotting them against a covariate to check for a non-linear functional form.\n\nDeviance residuals are a transformation of martingale residuals designed to address this skewness. The deviance residual $D_i$ is given by:\n$$D_i = \\text{sign}(M_i) \\sqrt{-2[M_i + \\delta_i \\log(\\delta_i - M_i)]}$$\nwhere the $\\log$ term is handled appropriately for $\\delta_i=0$. This transformation \"symmetrizes\" the distribution of the residuals, making them appear more like the residuals from a standard linear regression model, ideally following a standard normal distribution if the model is correctly specified. By creating a more symmetric, less skewed distribution, deviance residuals are generally considered superior to martingale residuals for graphical diagnostics like detecting non-linearities or identifying outliers, particularly under heavy censoring where the skewness of martingale residuals is most pronounced.\n\n**Part 2: Schoenfeld Residuals for Time-Varying Effects**\n\nThe proportional hazards assumption underlying the Cox model states that the hazard ratio between any two individuals is constant over time. For a specific covariate $X_k$, this means its coefficient $\\beta_k$ is constant. A time-varying coefficient, $\\beta_k(t)$, violates this assumption.\n\nSchoenfeld residuals are specifically designed to diagnose such violations. For each event that occurs at time $t_j$, a Schoenfeld residual is calculated for each covariate $k$. The residual is the difference between the covariate value for the subject $j$ who had the event, $X_{jk}$, and the expected value of that covariate across all subjects in the risk set $R(t_j)$ at that time:\n$$r_{jk} = X_{jk} - E[X_k \\mid R(t_j)] = X_{jk} - \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in R(t_j)} X_{ik} \\exp(X_i^\\top \\hat{\\beta})}{\\sum_{i \\in R(t_j)} \\exp(X_i^\\top \\hat{\\beta})}$$\nCrucially, these residuals are defined **only at event times**.\n\nUnder the PH assumption (i.e., $\\beta_k$ is constant), the expected value of the Schoenfeld residuals for covariate $k$ is zero at all times $t$. Therefore, a plot of the Schoenfeld residuals $r_{jk}$ against time $t_j$ should show a random scatter around zero. If $\\beta_k(t)$ is not constant, a systematic trend will appear in this plot.\n\nA formal test for a time-varying effect involves regressing the (scaled) Schoenfeld residuals on a function of time, $g(t)$. Common choices for $g(t)$ include $t$ itself, or $\\log(t)$ which can be more appropriate for capturing certain patterns of deviation. The model for this test is:\n$$r^*_{jk} = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1 g(t_j) + \\epsilon_j$$\nwhere $r^*_{jk}$ are the scaled Schoenfeld residuals. A statistically significant non-zero slope ($\\gamma_1 \\neq 0$) provides evidence against the PH assumption, suggesting that the effect of covariate $X_k$ varies with time.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Under heavy right-censoring, martingale residuals are highly skewed with a long negative tail and are bounded above by $1$, so deviance residuals are preferred because they approximately symmetrize the martingale residuals and stabilize their scale. To diagnose a time-varying effect for covariate $X_k$, compute scaled Schoenfeld residuals at event times and regress them on a function of time, such as $\\log(t)$, testing for a nonzero slope; a significant trend indicates that $\\beta_k(t)$ varies with time.**\nThis option correctly describes the properties of martingale and deviance residuals under heavy censoring and the rationale for preferring deviance residuals in this context. It also accurately outlines the standard, scientifically valid procedure for testing the proportional hazards assumption using Schoenfeld residuals.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Under heavy right-censoring, deviance residuals are more skewed than martingale residuals because many individuals have $0$ observed events; therefore, martingale residuals are preferred. To diagnose time-varying effects, average Schoenfeld residuals across all individuals at each follow-up time and test whether their mean is zero; deviations from zero imply no time-varying effects.**\nThis option is incorrect on both counts. First, deviance residuals are *less* skewed than martingale residuals by design. Second, the procedure for Schoenfeld residuals is misstated: they are only computed at event times, the test is for a trend over time (not a static mean), and the final clause (\"deviations from zero imply no time-varying effects\") is the reverse of the correct interpretation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Under heavy right-censoring, both martingale and deviance residuals are symmetric with mean zero, so the choice between them does not matter. To diagnose time-varying effects, regress Schoenfeld residuals for $X_k$ on the covariate $X_k$ itself and test whether the slope differs from zero; a nonzero slope indicates time variation in $\\beta_k(t)$.**\nThis option is incorrect. Martingale residuals are not symmetric under heavy censoring. Further, it proposes regressing Schoenfeld residuals on the covariate $X_k$, which is a procedure for checking functional form (linearity), not for testing the proportional hazards assumption (time-invariance). A test for time-variance requires relating the residuals to time.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Under heavy right-censoring, martingale residuals tend to cluster tightly around zero, but deviance residuals inflate to very large positive values; therefore, deviance residuals should be avoided. To diagnose time-varying effects, compute Schoenfeld residuals at both event times and censored times and test for independence from $\\log(t)$.**\nThis option presents a false description of the residuals' behavior. Under heavy censoring, most martingale residuals are large and negative, not clustered at zero. Deviance residuals do not \"inflate to very large positive values\". The description of the Schoenfeld residual test is also fundamentally flawed, as these residuals are not defined at censored times.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on this analysis, only option A provides a correct and coherent account of the statistical concepts and procedures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3107112"}, {"introduction": "Our focus so far has been on right-censored data, but many studies produce interval-censored observations, where an event is only known to have occurred between two follow-up times.

Using the provided PDF:\n$$\nf_i(T_i \\mid \\beta,k) = \\frac{k}{\\lambda_i}\\left(\\frac{T_i}{\\lambda_i}\\right)^{k-1}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\left(\\frac{T_i}{\\lambda_i}\\right)^k\\right)\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm, we get:\n$$\n\\ln f_i(T_i \\mid \\beta,k) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{k}{\\lambda_i}\\right) + (k-1)\\ln\\left(\\frac{T_i}{\\lambda_i}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{T_i}{\\lambda_i}\\right)^k\n$$\n$$\n= \\ln(k) - \\ln(\\lambda_i) + (k-1)(\\ln(T_i) - \\ln(\\lambda_i)) - \\frac{T_i^k}{\\lambda_i^k}\n$$\n$$\n= \\ln(k) - \\ln(\\lambda_i) + (k-1)\\ln(T_i) - (k-1)\\ln(\\lambda_i) - \\frac{T_i^k}{\\lambda_i^k}\n$$\nCombining the terms with $\\ln(\\lambda_i)$:\n$$\n\\ln f_i(T_i \\mid \\beta,k) = \\ln(k) + (k-1)\\ln(T_i) - k\\ln(\\lambda_i) - \\frac{T_i^k}{\\lambda_i^k}\n$$\nWe are given that $\\lambda_i = \\exp(\\mathbf{X}_i^{\\top}\\beta)$.

Let us denote this expectation by $\\mathbb{E}^{(m)}[\\cdot \\mid T_i \\in (L_i,R_i]]$. The expectation is taken over the random variable $T_i$.
