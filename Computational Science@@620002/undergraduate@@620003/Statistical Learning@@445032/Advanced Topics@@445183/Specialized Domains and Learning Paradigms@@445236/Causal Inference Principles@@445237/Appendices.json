The problem states we can assume SUTVA and consistency, which means $Y = Y(T)$. The ATE is $E[Y(1) - Y(0)]$. By the law of total expectation, we can write the ATE as:\n$$ E\\big[Y(1) - Y(0)\\big] = E_X\\Big[E\\big[Y(1) \\mid X\\big] - E\\big[Y(0) \\mid X\\big]\\Big] $$\nThe regression adjustment estimand is defined as:\n$$ \\tau_{adj} = E_X\\Big[E[Y \\mid T=1, X] - E[Y \\mid T=0, X]\\Big] $$\nBy consistency, $E[Y \\mid T=1, X] = E[Y(1) \\mid T=1, X]$ and $E[Y \\mid T=0, X] = E[Y(0) \\mid T=0, X]$.\nFor $\\tau_{adj}$ to be equal to the ATE, we require the conditional ignorability assumption (also known as unconfoundedness or selection on observables) to hold:\n$$ \\big(Y(1), Y(0)\\big) \\perp T \\mid X $$\nThis means that, conditional on the covariates $X$, the treatment assignment $T$ is independent of the potential outcomes. In the language of causal graphs, this is equivalent to stating that the set of covariates $X$ blocks all backdoor paths from the treatment $T$ to the outcome $Y$. A backdoor path is a non-causal path between $T$ and $Y$ that has an arrow into $T$.\n\nThe structural equation for the outcome in all scenarios implies that the true causal effect for any unit is $Y(1) - Y(0) = 2$. Therefore, the true Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is $E[2] = 2$. The problem reduces to checking in which scenarios the regression adjustment estimand $\\tau_{adj}$ is equal to $2$.\n\n### Option A\n- **Setup**: $T$ is fully randomized and independent of $X$. There is no unobserved confounder $U$.\n- **Analysis**: The conditional ignorability assumption $(Y(1), Y(0)) \\perp T \\mid X$ holds because treatment is independent of potential outcomes (which are functions of $X$ and $\\varepsilon$) even without conditioning on $X$. This is a randomized controlled trial. There are no backdoor paths to block. The regression adjustment estimand will recover the true ATE.\n- **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n### Option B\n- **Setup**: The treatment is determined by an unobserved variable $U$, so $T=U$. $U$ also directly affects the outcome $Y$. The observed covariate $X$ is independent of $U$.\n- **Analysis**: $U$ is a confounder, creating a backdoor path $T \\leftarrow U \\rightarrow Y$. Since $U$ is unobserved and the observed covariate $X$ is unrelated to $U$, conditioning on $X$ does not block this path. Conditional ignorability fails. The regression adjustment estimand will be biased. The observed outcome is $Y = 2T + T + \\varepsilon = 3T + \\varepsilon$, leading to an estimated effect of 3, not 2.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n### Option C\n- **Setup**: Similar to Option B, $U$ is an unobserved confounder ($T=U$). We observe a noisy proxy $X$ for $U$.\n- **Analysis**: The backdoor path $T \\leftarrow U \\rightarrow Y$ is still present. Conditioning on a proxy for the confounder, $X$, only partially blocks the backdoor path. This leads to residual confounding. Conditional ignorability fails. The regression adjustment estimand will be biased (it will still be 3, as conditioning on $X$ does not change the expectation of $Y$ given $T=U$).\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n### Option D\n- **Setup**: $U$ is a common cause of $T$ and $Y$. However, $U$ is perfectly observed, as $X=U$.\n- **Analysis**: The backdoor path $T \\leftarrow U \\rightarrow Y$ exists. By conditioning on $X$, we are conditioning on the confounder $U$ itself. This successfully blocks the backdoor path. The conditional ignorability assumption $(Y(1), Y(0)) \\perp T \\mid X$ holds because once we condition on $X=U$, treatment assignment $T$ is independent of the potential outcomes (which are also functions of $U$ and the independent error $\\varepsilon$). The regression adjustment estimand will recover the true ATE.\n- **Verdict**: Correct.\n\nThe scenarios where using the regression function $E[Y \\mid T, X]$ is sufficient to identify the ATE are A and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "3106696"}, {"introduction": "Having established the necessity of adjusting for confounding, we now turn to a powerful method for doing so: Inverse Propensity Weighting (IPW).

IPW Estimator and Trimming**\nThe untrimmed Horvitz-Thompson IPW estimator for the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is unbiased under the stated assumptions. Its expectation is:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{\\tau}_0] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{A Y}{p(X)}\\right] - \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{(1-A)Y}{1-p(X)}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}[Y(1)] - \\mathbb{E}[Y(0)] = \\tau $$\nHowever, its variance can be large if propensity scores $p(X)$ are close to 0 or 1. Clipping the propensity scores at a threshold $t$ replaces $p(X)$ with $p_t(X) = \\min(\\max(p(X), t), 1-t)$. This bounds the inverse probability weights, reducing variance but introducing bias.\n\n**2. Bias Derivation**\nThe expectation of the clipped estimator $\\widehat{\\tau}_t$ is:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{\\tau}_t] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{p(X)}{p_t(X)}m_1(X) - \\frac{1-p(X)}{1-p_t(X)}m_0(X)\\right] $$\nwhere $m_a(X) = \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid A=a, X]$. The bias is the difference between this expectation and the true ATE, $\\tau = \\mathbb{E}[m_1(X) - m_0(X)]$.\n$$ \\mathrm{Bias}(t) = \\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{\\tau}_t] - \\tau = \\mathbb{E}\\left[m_1(X)\\left(\\frac{p(X)}{p_t(X)} - 1\\right) - m_0(X)\\left(\\frac{1-p(X)}{1-p_t(X)} - 1\\right)\\right] $$\nThis formula shows that bias is introduced only in the regions where clipping occurs (i.e., where $p(X) \\neq p_t(X)$).\n\n**3. Adaptive Threshold Selection**\nIn practice, the bias formula is not directly usable as the true outcome models $m_a(X)$ are unknown. We can estimate them from data, for instance, by fitting an OLS model as specified in the problem. By plugging in the estimated models $\\widehat{m}_a(X)$, we get a sample-based estimate of the bias, $\\widehat{\\mathrm{Bias}}(t)$.\nThis allows us to construct a proxy for the Mean Squared Error (MSE):\n$$ \\widehat{\\mathrm{MSE}}_{\\mathrm{proxy}}(t) = \\widehat{\\mathbb{V}}_t + (\\widehat{\\mathrm{Bias}}(t))^2 $$\nwhere $\\widehat{\\mathbb{V}}_t$ is the estimated variance of the clipped estimator. The adaptive threshold $t_{\\mathrm{adapt}}$ is chosen to minimize this proxy MSE, providing a data-driven way to balance the bias-variance trade-off. This is contrasted with an oracle threshold $t_{\\mathrm{oracle}}$ that minimizes the true sample MSE, which is only available in a simulation context.\n\nThe simulation proceeds by generating data for each case, calculating the untrimmed and trimmed estimates, estimating the bias, finding the adaptive and oracle thresholds, and reporting the required performance metrics.
