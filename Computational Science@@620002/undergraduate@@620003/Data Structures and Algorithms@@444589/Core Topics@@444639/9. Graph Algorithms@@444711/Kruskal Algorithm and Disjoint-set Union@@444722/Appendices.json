A forest is an acyclic graph, and a spanning forest of an undirected graph is a subgraph that is a forest and spans all vertices. For a given integer $k$ with $1 \\le k \\le |V|$, a spanning forest with exactly $k$ trees is a spanning subgraph in which there are exactly $k$ connected components and no cycles. Among all such spanning forests with exactly $k$ trees, a minimum spanning forest is one whose total weight, defined as the sum of the weights of its included edges, is minimized.\n\nFundamental definitions to be used:\n- A connected component of a graph is a maximal subset of vertices such that every pair of vertices in the subset is connected by some path using edges in $E$.\n- A spanning tree of a connected component is a minimal connected acyclic subgraph that includes all vertices of that component.\n- The Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, weighted, undirected graph is a spanning tree of minimum total weight.\n- The Disjoint-Set Union (DSU) data structure (also known as Union-Find) maintains a partition of a set into disjoint subsets and supports two operations: find, which returns a representative of the subset containing a given element, and union, which merges the subsets containing two given elements.\n\nTask. Design and implement an algorithm that, given an undirected weighted graph $G=(V,E)$ and an integer $k$, computes the minimum total weight of a spanning forest of $G$ that has exactly $k$ trees, or determines that this is impossible. Your algorithm must:\n- Be justified from first principles using the fundamental definitions above, and must rely on the greedy selection of edges by nondecreasing weight, supported by a Disjoint-Set Union (DSU) to detect and prevent cycles.\n- Correctly detect infeasibility: if the number of connected components of $G$ (when considering all edges in $E$ regardless of weight) is $c$, then it is impossible to achieve exactly $k$ trees when $k < c$.\n\nReturn value convention. For each input instance:\n- If a minimum spanning forest with exactly $k$ trees exists, output the minimum possible total weight as an integer.\n- If it is impossible to obtain exactly $k$ trees, output the integer $-1$.\n\nVertices are labeled by consecutive integers from $0$ to $|V|-1$.

It is a well-posed problem in the field of graph algorithms, a sub-discipline of computer science. All terms are formally defined, the objectives are clear, and the constraints are consistent. The problem is a direct extension of the classic Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem, requiring the construction of a Minimum Spanning Forest (MSF) with a specified number of connected components (trees).\n\nThe solution hinges on a modification of Kruskal's algorithm, a greedy algorithm whose correctness is established by the cut property of MSTs. The core principle is that to connect a graph while minimizing total edge weight, one should always add the cheapest available edge that does not form a cycle.\n\nLet $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected, weighted graph with $|V| = n$ vertices. A forest with no edges consists of $n$ trees, where each vertex is its own tree (a connected component). Adding an edge $(u, v)$ to a forest can have two outcomes:\n1.  If vertices $u$ and $v$ are already in the same connected component (i.e., the same tree), adding the edge $(u, v)$ creates a cycle. This is disallowed in a forest.\n2.  If vertices $u$ and $v$ are in different components, adding the edge $(u, v)$ merges these two components into a single new component. This reduces the total number of trees in the forest by exactly one.\n\nThe task is to find a spanning forest with exactly $k$ trees and minimum total weight. Starting with $n$ vertices and $0$ edges, we have a forest of $n$ trees. To reach a state with $k$ trees, we must perform exactly $n - k$ successful merge operations. Each merge operation corresponds to adding one edge that connects two previously disconnected components.\n\nTo ensure the resulting forest has a minimum total weight, we must make the greediest choice at each step. This means that to perform the $n - k$ merges, we should use the $n - k$ cheapest edges from the graph that do not create cycles. Kruskal's algorithm provides a natural framework for this. By sorting all edges in non-decreasing order of weight and adding them sequentially if they do not form a cycle, we are guaranteed to be selecting the cheapest possible edges to connect components.\n\nThe Disjoint-Set Union (DSU) data structure is the canonical choice for efficiently managing the components of the forest. It provides two essential operations:\n- `find(u)`: Returns a representative for the component containing vertex $u$. Two vertices $u$ and $v$ are in the same component if and only if `find(u)` is equal to `find(v)`.\n- `union(u, v)`: Merges the components containing $u$ and $v$.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: Initialize a DSU data structure with $n$ disjoint sets, one for each vertex in $V$. The number of components, `num_components`, is initialized to $n$. The total weight of the forest, `total_weight`, is initialized to $0$.\n\n2.  **Edge Sorting**: Create a list of all edges in $E$ and sort it in non-decreasing order of edge weights.\n\n3.  **Greedy Selection**: Iterate through the sorted edges $(u, v, w)$. For each edge:\n    a. Check if vertices $u$ and $v$ are already in the same component by comparing `find(u)` and `find(v)`.\n    b. If `find(u)` is not equal to `find(v)`, the edge connects two different components and will not create a cycle. This is a candidate for inclusion in our forest.\n    c. Before adding the edge, check if the desired number of components has already been reached. If `num_components` is equal to $k$, we have already performed the necessary $n-k$ merges. Adding more edges would reduce the number of components below $k$. Therefore, if `num_components == k`, we stop and do not add any more edges.\n    d. If `num_components > k`, we still need to merge components. Add the current edge:\n        i.  Merge the components of $u$ and $v$ using the `union(u, v)` operation.\n        ii. Decrement `num_components` by $1$.\n        iii. Add the edge's weight $w$ to `total_weight`.\n\n4.  **Termination and Result**: The iteration over edges stops either when all edges have been considered or when the forest has been constructed with exactly $k$ components. After the loop terminates:\n    a. If `num_components` equals the target $k$, the algorithm has successfully constructed a minimum spanning forest with $k$ trees. The Minimum Spanning Tree theory guarantees that this greedy procedure yields a minimum total weight. The algorithm returns `total_weight`.\n    b. If `num_components` is greater than $k$, it means that even after using all possible non-cycle-forming edges, we could not reduce the number of components to $k$. This occurs if the original graph $G$ has $c$ connected components, and the target $k$ is less than $c$. It is impossible to form a graph with fewer components than are inherent to its structure. In this case, a solution is impossible, and the algorithm returns $-1$.\n\nThis procedure correctly handles all cases, including graphs with negative weights (as Kruskal's algorithm is correct for these) and disconnected graphs, and it successfully identifies when a solution is infeasible.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Minimum Spanning Forest with k trees problem for a suite of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    class DSU:\n        \"\"\"\n        A Disjoint-Set Union (DSU) data structure with path compression and union by size.\n        \"\"\"\n        def __init__(self, n):\n            self.parent = list(range(n))\n            self.size = [1] * n\n\n        def find(self, i):\n            \"\"\"Finds the representative of the set containing element i with path compression.\"\"\"\n            if self.parent[i] == i:\n                return i\n            self.parent[i] = self.find(self.parent[i])\n            return self.parent[i]\n\n        def union(self, i, j):\n            \"\"\"Merges the sets containing elements i and j using union by size.\"\"\"\n            root_i = self.find(i)\n            root_j = self.find(j)\n            if root_i != root_j:\n                # Union by size: attach smaller tree under root of larger tree\n                if self.size[root_i] < self.size[root_j]:\n                    root_i, root_j = root_j, root_i\n                self.parent[root_j] = root_i\n                self.size[root_i] += self.size[root_j]\n                return True\n            return False\n\n    def compute_msf_k_trees(n, edges, k):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the minimum total weight of a spanning forest with exactly k trees.\n\n        Args:\n            n (int): The number of vertices, labeled 0 to n-1.\n            edges (list of tuples): A list of (u, v, w) tuples representing edges.\n            k (int): The target number of trees in the forest.\n\n        Returns:\n            int: The minimum total weight, or -1 if impossible.\n        \"\"\"\n        if k < 1 or k > n:\n            return -1  # Invalid value of k\n\n        # Sort edges by weight in non-decreasing order\n        edges.sort(key=lambda item: item[2])\n        \n        dsu = DSU(n)\n        total_weight = 0\n        num_components = n\n        \n        for u, v, w in edges:\n            # If we've already reached the target number of components, we're done.\n            if num_components == k:\n                break\n                \n            # If adding the edge merges two components\n            if dsu.union(u, v):\n                total_weight += w\n                num_components -= 1\n        \n        # After iterating through all possible edges, check if we reached the target k.\n        if num_components == k:\n            return total_weight\n        else:\n            # This case occurs if the graph is disconnected into c components and k < c.\n            return -1\n    \n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Test 1 (happy path, connected, k=1)\n        (4, [(0, 1, 1), (1, 2, 2), (2, 3, 3), (0, 3, 4), (0, 2, 5), (1, 3, 6)], 1),\n        # Test 2 (early stopping, same graph, k=2)\n        (4, [(0, 1, 1), (1, 2, 2), (2, 3, 3), (0, 3, 4), (0, 2, 5), (1, 3, 6)], 2),\n        # Test 3 (infeasible, disconnected requires merging components that do not have interconnecting edges)\n        (5, [(0, 1, 10), (2, 3, 1), (3, 4, 1), (2, 4, 5)], 1),\n        # Test 4 (boundary, k=n so zero edges chosen even with negative edges available)\n        (3, [(0, 1, -5), (1, 2, -2)], 3),\n        # Test 5 (negative weights, connected, k=1)\n        (4, [(0, 1, -5), (1, 2, -2), (2, 3, -1), (0, 3, 4), (0, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2)], 1),\n        # Test 6 (ties in edge weights, early stopping, k=3)\n        (4, [(0, 1, 1), (1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 1), (3, 0, 1), (0, 2, 2), (1, 3, 2)], 3),\n        # Test 7 (disconnected but feasible with k=c)\n        (5, [(0, 1, 10), (2, 3, 1), (3, 4, 1), (2, 4, 5)], 2),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for n, E, k in test_cases:\n        # A fresh copy of edges is needed as list.sort is in-place\n        edges_copy = list(E)\n        result = compute_msf_k_trees(n, edges_copy, k)\n        results.append(result)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3243736"}, {"introduction": "A Disjoint-Set Union is not just for tracking connectivity; it can be enhanced to answer complex questions about the components themselves.

This structure will be used for two distinct tasks: constructing a Minimum Spanning Forest (MSF) with Kruskal's algorithm and processing a series of dynamic union and query operations.\n\n### Augmented Disjoint-Set Union (DSU) Data Structure\n\nA standard DSU data structure, also known as a union-find data structure, maintains a collection of disjoint sets. The core operations are `find(i)`, which returns a canonical representative (or root) of the set containing element $i$, and `union(i, j)`, which merges the sets containing elements $i$ and $j$. To achieve near-constant amortized time complexity, `find` is implemented with path compression, and `union` is implemented using an optimization like union by size or union by rank.\n\nThe problem requires augmenting this structure. For each set in the partition, we must maintain two additional properties:\n1.  The sum of the integer values associated with the elements in the set.\n2.  The maximum integer value among all elements in the set.\n\nLet the set of $n$ vertices be $\\{1, ..., n\\}$, with associated integer values $\\{a_1, ..., a_n\\}$.\nOur DSU will be implemented using four arrays, indexed from $1$ to $n$:\n-   `parent[i]`: Stores the parent of element $i$.\n-   `size[i]`: Stores the size of the set if $i$ is the root.\n-   `sums[i]`: Stores the component sum of the set if $i$ is the root.\n-   `max_vals[i]`: Stores the component maximum of the set if $i$ is the root.\n\n**Initialization:**\nFor each element $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, we initialize $n$ disjoint sets:\n-   `parent[i] = i`\n-   `size[i] = 1`\n-   `sums[i] = a_i`\n-   `max_vals[i] = a_i`\n\n**`find(i)` Operation:**\nThis operation finds the root of the set containing element $i$. Path compression is applied by making every node on the find path point directly to the root. This flattens the tree structure, speeding up future operations. The augmented values (sum and max) are only stored at the root, so no updates to them are needed during path compression.\n\n$$\n\\text{find}(i) =\n\\begin{cases}\n    i & \\text{if } \\text{parent}[i] = i \\\\\n    \\text{parent}[i] := \\text{find}(\\text{parent}[i]) & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n**`union(i, j)` Operation:**\nThis operation merges the sets containing elements $i$ and $j$. Let $r_i = \\text{find}(i)$ and $r_j = \\text{find}(j)$ be the roots of their respective sets. If $r_i \\neq r_j$, the sets are merged. We use union by size: the root of the smaller set is attached to the root of the larger set. Assume $\\text{size}[r_i] \\ge \\text{size}[r_j]$.\nThe updates are as follows:\n-   `parent[r_j] = r_i`\n-   `size[r_i] = size[r_i] + size[r_j]`\n-   `sums[r_i] = sums[r_i] + sums[r_j]`\n-   `max_vals[r_i] = \\max(\\text{max\\_vals}[r_i], \\text{max\\_vals}[r_j])`\n\nIf $\\text{size}[r_i] < \\text{size}[r_j]$, the roles of $r_i$ and $r_j$ are reversed.\n\n**`query(i)` Operation:**\nTo find the component sum and maximum for an element $i$, we first find its root $r_i = \\text{find}(i)$. The required values are then simply `sums[r_i]` and `max_vals[r_i]`.\n\n### Task A: Kruskal's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Forest (MSF)\n\nKruskal's algorithm finds an MSF of a weighted, undirected graph $G = (V, E)$. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  Initialize a DSU structure with $|V|$ sets, one for each vertex.\n2.  Create a list of all edges $E$ and sort them in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n3.  Initialize the total MSF weight $W = 0$.\n4.  Iterate through the sorted edges $(u, v)$ with weight $w$.\n5.  For each edge, if $\\text{find}(u) \\neq \\text{find}(v)$, it means $u$ and $v$ are in different components. Adding this edge will not form a cycle. Therefore:\n    a. Add the edge to the MSF.\n    b. Add its weight to the total weight: $W = W + w$.\n    c. Merge the components of $u$ and $v$: $\\text{union}(u, v)$.\n6.  If $\\text{find}(u) = \\text{find}(v)$, adding the edge would create a cycle, so it is discarded.\nAfter all edges are processed, $W$ is the total weight of the MSF.

This advanced exercise asks you to find the second-best Minimum Spanning Tree, a problem that requires moving beyond simple construction. You will need to apply your knowledge of MST properties, particularly the cycle property, to systematically evaluate alternatives and find the next best solution.", "problem": "You are given a connected, undirected, weighted graph $G = (V, E)$ with $|V| = n$ vertices labeled from $0$ to $n - 1$ and $|E| = m$ edges. Each edge $e \\in E$ connects two distinct vertices and has a nonnegative integer weight. A spanning tree $T$ of $G$ is a subgraph that includes all $n$ vertices, is connected, and contains exactly $n - 1$ edges. The total weight of a spanning tree $T$ is the sum of the weights of its edges. The minimum spanning tree (MST) of $G$ is a spanning tree whose total weight is minimal among all spanning trees of $G$. Let the MST weight be denoted by $W^\\star$. Define the second-best minimum spanning tree weight $W^{(2)}$ to be the minimal total weight among all spanning trees whose total weight is strictly greater than $W^\\star$. If no such spanning tree exists (for example, when the graph has exactly one spanning tree and thus no alternative spanning trees), define $W^{(2)} = -1$.\n\nYour task is to develop, from first principles, a program that computes $W^{(2)}$ for a given graph by constructing the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal’s algorithm and Disjoint-Set Union (DSU), also known as the Union-Find data structure, and then determining the minimal strictly greater spanning tree weight via a logically justified method. The foundational base for this derivation must rely on core definitions of spanning trees and well-tested facts such as the cut property and cycle property of minimum spanning trees. No shortcut formulas should be assumed without justification.\n\nInput is not provided interactively; instead, your program must hard-code the following test suite of graphs and produce the aggregated output. For each graph, compute the single integer $W^{(2)}$ as defined above.\n\nTest Suite:\n- Graph $G_1$: $n = 5$ vertices labeled $0, 1, 2, 3, 4$. Edge list with weights (each tuple is $(u, v, w)$):\n  - $(0, 1, 1)$\n  - $(1, 2, 2)$\n  - $(2, 3, 2)$\n  - $(3, 4, 3)$\n  - $(0, 2, 4)$\n  - $(1, 3, 2)$\n  - $(0, 4, 10)$\n  - $(2, 4, 5)$\n- Graph $G_2$: $n = 4$ vertices labeled $0, 1, 2, 3$. Edge list:\n  - $(0, 1, 1)$\n  - $(1, 2, 1)$\n  - $(2, 3, 1)$\n  - $(3, 0, 1)$\n  - $(0, 2, 2)$\n  - $(1, 3, 2)$\n- Graph $G_3$: $n = 4$ vertices labeled $0, 1, 2, 3$. Edge list:\n  - $(0, 1, 5)$\n  - $(1, 2, 6)$\n  - $(2, 3, 7)$\n\nOutput Specification:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (for example, $[x_1, x_2, x_3]$), where $x_i$ is the computed integer $W^{(2)}$ for the $i$-th graph in the test suite, in the same order $G_1$, $G_2$, $G_3$.\n\nNo physical units, angles, or percentage formats are involved in this problem; all outputs are unitless integers as defined above. Ensure the algorithm is universally applicable to any modern programming language and scientifically sound. The program must be self-contained and require no user input, external files, or network access.", "solution": "The problem requires us to compute the second-best minimum spanning tree weight, denoted $W^{(2)}$, for a given connected, undirected, weighted graph $G=(V,E)$. $W^{(2)}$ is defined as the minimum weight among all spanning trees whose weight is strictly greater than the minimum spanning tree (MST) weight, $W^\\star$. If no such tree exists, $W^{(2)}$ is $-1$. The solution must be developed from first principles, utilizing Kruskal's algorithm and a Disjoint-Set Union (DSU) data structure.\n\nOur approach is a two-step process. First, we find an MST of the graph $G$ and its weight $W^\\star$. Second, we systematically generate alternative spanning trees and identify the one with the smallest weight that is strictly greater than $W^\\star$.\n\n**Step 1: Finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**\n\nWe will use Kruskal's algorithm to find an MST. This algorithm operates on a fundamental principle of greedy selection, validated by the cut property of MSTs.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  Create a list of all edges $e \\in E$ in the graph $G$.\n2.  Sort this list of edges in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n3.  Initialize a DSU data structure with $n=|V|$ disjoint sets, one for each vertex. The DSU structure will be used to efficiently detect whether adding an edge creates a cycle.\n4.  Initialize an empty set of edges for our MST, let's call it $T^\\star_{edges}$, and set the total weight $W^\\star$ to $0$.\n5.  Iterate through the sorted list of edges. For each edge $(u, v)$ with weight $w$:\n    *   Check if vertices $u$ and $v$ are already in the same connected component. This is done by querying the DSU: `find(u) == find(v)`.\n    *   If they are in different components, adding the edge $(u, v)$ will not form a cycle. We add it to our MST:\n        *   Add $(u, v, w)$ to $T^\\star_{edges}$.\n        *   Add its weight $w$ to $W^\\star$.\n        *   Merge the components of $u$ and $v$ using the DSU operation: `union(u, v)`.\n    *   If they are already in the same component, adding the edge $(u, v)$ would create a cycle. This edge is not part of our MST and is stored in a separate list of non-MST edges.\n6.  The algorithm terminates when $|T^\\star_{edges}| = n-1$ edges have been added. The resulting set $T^\\star_{edges}$ forms an MST, and its total weight is $W^\\star$.\n\n**Step 2: Finding the Second-Best MST Weight ($W^{(2)}$)**\n\nThe core principle for finding the second-best MST relates to the structure of spanning trees. Any spanning tree $T$ of a graph $G$ can be transformed into any other spanning tree $T'$ through a series of edge-swap operations. A more specific property is that for any given spanning tree $T^\\star$, any other spanning tree $T$ can be obtained by adding an edge $e' \\notin T^\\star$ and removing an edge $e \\in T^\\star$ from the unique cycle created by adding $e'$.\n\nLet $T^\\star$ be the MST we found in Step 1, with weight $W^\\star$. Any other spanning tree must contain at least one edge not in $T^\\star$. Let us consider forming a new spanning tree by taking $T^\\star$, adding one edge $e' = (u,v)$ that is not in $T^\\star$, and removing one edge from $T^\\star$.\n\nAdding the edge $e'=(u,v)$ to the tree $T^\\star$ creates exactly one simple cycle. This cycle consists of the edge $e'$ itself and the unique path in $T^\\star$ connecting vertices $u$ and $v$. To transform this new graph back into a spanning tree, we must break the cycle by removing any one of its edges. To maintain connectivity, the removed edge must be one of the original edges of $T^\\star$ that lies on this cycle.\n\nLet the path in $T^\\star$ from $u$ to $v$ consist of edges $\\{e_1, e_2, \\dots, e_k\\}$. If we remove an edge $e_i$ from this path, we obtain a new spanning tree $T_i$. The weight of this new tree is given by:\n$$W(T_i) = W(T^\\star) - w(e_i) + w(e')$$\nOur goal is to find the minimum of these $W(T_i)$ values, across all possible choices of $e'$ and $e_i$, such that $W(T_i) > W^\\star$. This is equivalent to minimizing the quantity $w(e') - w(e_i)$, subject to $w(e') - w(e_i) > 0$.\n\nThis leads to the following algorithm to find $W^{(2)}$:\n1.  Initialize a variable for the second-best weight, $W_{candidate}^{(2)}$, to a value representing infinity.\n2.  For each edge $e' = (u, v)$ with weight $w(e')$ that was *not* included in the MST (i.e., the non-MST edges identified in Step 1):\n    a. Find the unique path in the MST, $T^\\star$, between vertices $u$ and $v$. This can be accomplished using a graph traversal algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) on the graph formed only by the MST edges.\n    b. For each edge $e_{path}$ on this path, with weight $w(e_{path})$:\n        i.  Consider the new spanning tree formed by adding $e'$ and removing $e_{path}$. Its weight is $W_{new} = W^\\star - w(e_{path}) + w(e')$.\n        ii. If $W_{new} > W^\\star$, this is a valid candidate for the second-best MST. We update our minimum: $W_{candidate}^{(2)} = \\min(W_{candidate}^{(2)}, W_{new})$.\n3.  After iterating through all non-MST edges and all possible swaps, the value $W_{candidate}^{(2)}$ will be our answer.\n4.  If, after checking all possibilities, $W_{candidate}^{(2)}$ remains at its initial infinite value, it signifies that no spanning tree with a weight strictly greater than $W^\\star$ exists. This occurs if the graph has only one spanning tree (as in test case $G_3$), or if all other spanning trees have the same weight as the MST. In this scenario, we set $W^{(2)} = -1$. Otherwise, $W^{(2)} = W_{candidate}^{(2)}$.\n\nThis method is exhaustive and guarantees finding the minimal weight strictly greater than $W^\\star$, as it is constructed from the fundamental properties relating all spanning trees to a given MST.\nThe implementation will require a DSU class with path compression and union-by-size/rank optimizations for Kruskal's algorithm, and an adjacency list representation of the MST to facilitate the path-finding using BFS.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the second-best minimum spanning tree weight for a suite of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    class DSU:\n        \"\"\"\n        Disjoint-Set Union (Union-Find) data structure with path compression and union by size.\n        \"\"\"\n        def __init__(self, n):\n            self.parent = list(range(n))\n            self.size = [1] * n\n\n        def find(self, i):\n            if self.parent[i] == i:\n                return i\n            self.parent[i] = self.find(self.parent[i])\n            return self.parent[i]\n\n        def union(self, i, j):\n            root_i = self.find(i)\n            root_j = self.find(j)\n            if root_i != root_j:\n                if self.size[root_i] < self.size[root_j]:\n                    root_i, root_j = root_j, root_i\n                self.parent[root_j] = root_i\n                self.size[root_i] += self.size[root_j]\n                return True\n            return False\n\n    def find_second_best_mst(n, edges):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the second-best MST weight for a single graph.\n        \"\"\"\n        if not edges or n -
