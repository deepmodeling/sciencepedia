The concepts are mathematically rigorous.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly specified. The algorithm's behavior is unambiguously described. The question asks for the conditions under which this specific algorithm is correct, which is a standard form of analysis in algorithm theory. A unique answer regarding these conditions should exist.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is phrased in objective, mathematical language.

The correctness of the algorithm can be mathematically proven or disproven under given conditions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe problem of minimizing a product of positive weights, $\\min \\prod w(e_i)$, can be transformed into an equivalent problem by applying the natural logarithm, which is a strictly increasing function. Minimizing a value is equivalent to minimizing its logarithm.\n\nLet the cost of a path $P$ be $C(P) = \\prod_{e_i \\in P} w(e_i)$.\nThe logarithm of the cost is $\\ln(C(P)) = \\ln\\left(\\prod_{e_i \\in P} w(e_i)\\right)$.\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this becomes an additive cost:\n$$\n\\ln(C(P)) = \\sum_{e_i \\in P} \\ln(w(e_i)).\n$$\nSo, the problem of finding a path with the minimum product-cost is equivalent to finding a path with the minimum sum-cost in a transformed graph where each edge $e$ has a new weight $w'(e) = \\ln(w(e))$.\n\nThe greedy algorithm described in the problem statement is a multiplicative version of Dijkstra's algorithm. Let's analyze its operations in the logarithmic space.\n-   **Initialization:** $d(s)=1$ becomes $\\ln(d(s)) = \\ln(1) = 0$. For $v \\neq s$, $d(v)=\\infty$ becomes $\\ln(d(v)) = \\infty$. This is the standard initialization for Dijkstra's algorithm.\n-   **Selection:** The algorithm selects the vertex $x$ with the minimum tentative product $d(x)$. Since $\\ln(x)$ is strictly increasing, minimizing $d(x)$ is equivalent to minimizing $\\ln(d(x))$. This selection step is identical to that of the standard Dijkstra's algorithm on the log-transformed costs.\n-   **Relaxation:** The update rule is $d(y) \\leftarrow \\min\\{d(y), d(x) \\cdot w(x,y)\\}$. In the logarithmic space, this is:\n    $$\n    \\ln(d(y)) \\leftarrow \\ln(\\min\\{d(y), d(x) \\cdot w(x,y)\\}) = \\min\\{\\ln(d(y)), \\ln(d(x) \\cdot w(x,y))\\}\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\ln(d(y)) \\leftarrow \\min\\{\\ln(d(y)), \\ln(d(x)) + \\ln(w(x,y))\\}\n    $$\n    This is precisely the relaxation step of the standard Dijkstra's algorithm performed on the log-transformed costs $\\ln(d(\\cdot))$ with edge weights $w'(e) = \\ln(w(e))$.\n\nTherefore, the given multiplicative greedy algorithm is operationally isomorphic to the standard additive Dijkstra's algorithm running on the graph with edge weights $w'(e) = \\ln(w(e))$.\n\nThe standard Dijkstra's algorithm is guaranteed to find the shortest paths from a source to all other vertices if and only if all edge weights in the graph are non-negative.\nThus, the given multiplicative algorithm is correct if and only if all the transformed edge weights $w'(e)$ are non-negative.\nThe condition is:\n$$\nw'(e) \\ge 0 \\quad \\forall e \\in E\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(w(e)) \\ge 0 \\quad \\forall e \\in E\n$$\nExponentiating both sides, we get:\n$$\nw(e) \\ge e^0 \\quad \\forall e \\in E\n$$\n$$\nw(e) \\ge 1 \\quad \\forall e \\in E\n$$\nThis establishes that the necessary and sufficient condition for the multiplicative Dijkstra-style algorithm to be correct is that all edge weights must be greater than or equal to $1$.\n\nIf there exists any edge $e$ with $0 < w(e) < 1$, then its corresponding log-transformed weight $w'(e) = \\ln(w(e))$ will be negative. The standard Dijkstra's algorithm is not guaranteed to work correctly in the presence of negative edge weights, and thus the equivalent multiplicative algorithm is also not guaranteed to work.\n\nLet's construct a counterexample for a case where an edge weight is less than $1$.\nConsider a graph with vertices $\\{s, u, y\\}$ and edges:\n-   $(s, u)$ with weight $w(s,u) = 3$.\n-   $(s, y)$ with weight $w(s,y) = 4$.\n-   $(y, u)$ with weight $w(y,u) = 0.5$.\n\n1.  **Initialize:** $d(s) = 1$, $d(u) = \\infty$, $d(y) = \\infty$. The set of processed vertices is $S = \\emptyset$. Process $s$. $S = \\{s\\}$.\n2.  **Relax edges from $s$**: $d(u) \\leftarrow \\min(\\infty, d(s) \\cdot w(s,u)) = 1 \\cdot 3 = 3$. $d(y) \\leftarrow \\min(\\infty, d(s) \\cdot w(s,y)) = 1 \\cdot 4 = 4$.\n3.  **Select next vertex:** The unprocessed vertices are $u$ and $y$. Their tentative costs are $d(u)=3$ and $d(y)=4$. The minimum is $d(u)=3$. The algorithm selects $u$.\n4.  **Greedy Choice:** The algorithm finalizes the cost from $s$ to $u$ as $d(u)=3$.\n5.  **Validation of the Choice:** Is this the true minimum product-cost? The path $s \\to u$ has cost $3$. However, another path exists: $s \\to y \\to u$. Its cost is $w(s,y) \\cdot w(y,u) = 4 \\cdot 0.5 = 2$.\nThe true minimum cost is $2$, but the algorithm's greedy choice led to a final cost of $3$. The greedy choice was not safe. This failure confirms that the presence of an edge with weight less than $1$ can cause the algorithm to fail.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. It works for all graphs with $w(e)>0$ without any transformation; multiplication in relaxations preserves the greedy-choice property.**\nThis is incorrect. The counterexample provided above ($w(y,u) = 0.5 < 1$) demonstrates a case where the algorithm fails. The greedy choice is not safe in general if weights can be less than $1$.\n\n**B. It works for all graphs with $w(e)>0$ if we transform edge weights by $w'(e)=\\ln w(e)$ and run the standard Dijkstra algorithm on $(V,E)$ with weights $w'$.**\nThis is incorrect. This option describes a different procedure (transform then run standard Dijkstra). But even this procedure is not universally correct. If any original edge weight $w(e)$ is in the interval $(0, 1)$, its transformed weight $w'(e) = \\ln(w(e))$ will be negative. The standard Dijkstra's algorithm is not guaranteed to work correctly on graphs with negative edge weights. The counterexample graph from above, when transformed, would have weights $\\ln(3)$, $\\ln(4)$, and $\\ln(0.5) < 0$. Standard Dijkstra would fail on this transformed graph.\n\n**C. It works exactly when $w(e)\\ge 1$ for all edges $e\\in E$; if any edge has $w(e)<1$, the greedy-choice can fail.**\nThis statement is correct. The phrase \"exactly when\" implies a necessary and sufficient condition.\n-   **Sufficiency:** If all $w(e) \\ge 1$, then all log-transformed weights $\\ln(w(e)) \\ge 0$. The multiplicative algorithm is isomorphic to standard Dijkstra on these non-negative weights, so it is correct.\n-   **Necessity:** The second clause, \"if any edge has $w(e)<1$, the greedy-choice can fail,\" addresses this. Our counterexample confirms that having an edge with weight $w(e) < 1$ can indeed cause the algorithm to fail. Thus, the condition $w(e) \\ge 1$ for all $e$ is not only sufficient but also necessary for the algorithm to be *guaranteed* to be correct on all graphs.\n\n**D. It never works for product minimization, even if all $w(e)\\ge 1$.**\nThis is incorrect. As shown in the analysis for option C, the algorithm is guaranteed to work correctly when all edge weights $w(e) \\ge 1$.\n\n**E. It works whenever the graph has no cycles, regardless of the values of $w(e)>0$.**\nThis is incorrect. The counterexample graph used above is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), as it contains no cycles. The algorithm failed on this DAG because of the edge weight $w(y,u) = 0.5 < 1$. The property of being acyclic does not save the Dijkstra-style greedy approach if its fundamental requirement (non-decreasing path costs, corresponding to $w(e) \\ge 1$) is violated. Shortest paths on DAGs are correctly found using an algorithm based on topological sorting, which processes vertices in an order that guarantees correctness regardless of edge weight signs (as long as they are finite).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "3237567"}, {"introduction": "While the greedy-choice property underpins elegant and efficient algorithms, many problems have no such structure, and a seemingly intuitive greedy strategy can fail.

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a rooted binary tree storing keys such that for every node with key $x$, all keys in its left subtree are strictly less than $x$, and all keys in its right subtree are strictly greater than $x$. The standard BST insertion algorithm is greedy: given a new key $k$, starting from the root, it compares $k$ to the current nodeâ€™s key and moves to the left child if $k$ is smaller or to the right child if $k$ is larger, continuing this local choice until an empty spot is found where $k$ is inserted.\n\nYou will construct two BSTs on $S$ using greedy insertion with two different insertion orders:\n\n1. A degenerate tree obtained by choosing an insertion order that yields a strictly right-skewed tree (a chain). Provide one such insertion order and argue why greedy insertion produces a right-skewed tree for it.\n\n2. A balanced tree obtained by choosing an insertion order that yields a perfectly balanced BST (i.e., a complete binary tree with height $h$ and $2^{h+1}-1$ nodes where all levels are full). Provide one such insertion order and argue why greedy insertion produces a perfectly balanced tree for it.\n\nAssume successful searches are performed uniformly at random over all keys in $S$. The cost of a successful search for a key is defined to be the number of comparisons performed, which equals $d+1$ for a node at depth $d$ (where the root has depth $0$).\n\nCompute the difference between the average number of comparisons for successful search in the degenerate tree and the average number of comparisons for successful search in the balanced tree you constructed. Express your final answer as an exact fraction. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires the construction of two distinct Binary Search Trees (BSTs) from a given set of $15$ keys, $S = \\{2, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 28, 31, 33, 36, 40, 44\\}$, using a greedy insertion algorithm. We must then compute the difference in the average search cost for a successful search between these two trees. The number of keys is $N=15$. The cost of a successful search for a key at depth $d$ is given as $d+1$, where the root is at depth $d=0$. Searches are assumed to be uniformly random over all keys.\n\nFirst, we analyze the construction and cost of a degenerate, right-skewed tree.\nTo create a right-skewed tree, where each node has at most a right child, every newly inserted key must be greater than all keys already in the tree. The greedy BST insertion algorithm places a key $k$ to the right of a node with key $x$ if $k > x$. By repeatedly making this local choice, to build a chain of right children, we must insert the keys in strictly increasing order. The sorted set of keys is $(2, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 28, 31, 33, 36, 40, 44)$.\nTherefore, one such insertion order is: $(2, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 28, 31, 33, 36, 40, 44)$.\nLet's trace the insertion:\n1. Insert $2$: The tree is a single node, the root, with key $2$.\n2. Insert $5$: Since $5 > 2$, it is inserted as the right child of $2$.\n3. Insert $7$: Since $7 > 2$, we move to the right child ($5$). Since $7 > 5$, it is inserted as the right child of $5$.\nThis process continues for all keys. Each new key, being the largest so far, will always traverse the rightmost path from the root and be inserted as the new rightmost leaf. This creates a degenerate tree that is a simple chain to the right.\n\nIn this right-skewed tree, the keys are located at depths $d=0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 14$. The key $2$ is at depth $0$, $5$ is at depth $1$, and so on, up to key $44$ at depth $14$. The search costs ($d+1$) for the $15$ keys are therefore $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 15$.\nSince searches are uniformly distributed, the probability of searching for any specific key is $\\frac{1}{15}$. The average number of comparisons for a successful search, $C_{\\text{degen}}$, is the sum of all individual search costs divided by the number of keys:\n$$C_{\\text{degen}} = \\frac{1}{15} \\sum_{i=1}^{15} i$$\nUsing the formula for the sum of the first $n$ integers, $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$:\n$$C_{\\text{degen}} = \\frac{1}{15} \\left( \\frac{15(15+1)}{2} \\right) = \\frac{16}{2} = 8$$\n\nNext, we analyze the construction and cost of a perfectly balanced BST.\nThe problem defines a perfectly balanced BST as a complete binary tree where all levels are full. The number of nodes in such a tree of height $h$ is $2^{h+1}-1$. Our set has $N=15$ keys, and since $15 = 2^{3+1}-1$, a perfectly balanced BST of height $h=3$ can be formed.\n\nTo construct this tree using greedy insertion, we must choose an insertion order that places the correct keys at the correct positions. The root of a balanced BST must be the median of the sorted keys. The keys in its left and right subtrees must then be recursively structured in the same way. This suggests an insertion order that follows a pre-order traversal of the target balanced tree.\nThe sorted set of keys is $S = (2, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 28, 31, 33, 36, 40, 44)$.\nThe median of $15$ keys is the $\\frac{15+1}{2} = 8$-th key, which is $22$. This will be the root.\nThe left subtree will contain the $7$ keys smaller than $22$: $\\{2, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 20\\}$. Its root will be their median, the $4$-th key, which is $9$.\nThe right subtree will contain the $7$ keys larger than $22$: $\\{25, 28, 31, 33, 36, 40, 44\\}$. Its root will be their median, the $4$-th key ($33$).\nContinuing this logic, we deduce the keys at each level:\n- Depth $d=0$: $\\{22\\}$ ($1$ node)\n- Depth $d=1$: $\\{9, 33\\}$ ($2$ nodes)\n- Depth $d=2$: $\\{5, 15, 28, 40\\}$ ($4$ nodes)\n- Depth $d=3$: $\\{2, 7, 12, 20, 25, 31, 36, 44\\}$ ($8$ nodes)\n\nOne insertion order that creates this tree is the pre-order traversal of the final tree structure: $(22, 9, 5, 2, 7, 15, 12, 20, 33, 28, 25, 31, 40, 36, 44)$. When inserting a key from this sequence, the greedy algorithm will place it in an empty spot. Because we insert the root of each subsequent subtree before any of its children, the empty spot found by the algorithm is precisely the correct position for that key in the perfectly balanced tree.\n\nNow we compute the average search cost, $C_{\\text{bal}}$. The cost is $d+1$.\n- At depth $d=0$: $1$ node with cost $0+1=1$. Total cost: $1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n- At depth $d=1$: $2$ nodes with cost $1+1=2$. Total cost: $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n- At depth $d=2$: $4$ nodes with cost $2+1=3$. Total cost: $4 \\times 3 = 12$.\n- At depth $d=3$: $8$ nodes with cost $3+1=4$. Total cost: $8 \\times 4 = 32$.\nThe total cost for all possible successful searches is the sum of these costs: $1 + 4 + 12 + 32 = 49$.\nThe average search cost is the total cost divided by the number of keys, $N=15$:\n$$C_{\\text{bal}} = \\frac{49}{15}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the difference between the average number of comparisons in the degenerate tree and the balanced tree:\n$$\\text{Difference} = C_{\\text{degen}} - C_{\\text{bal}} = 8 - \\frac{49}{15}$$\nTo subtract, we find a common denominator:\n$$\\text{Difference} = \\frac{8 \\times 15}{15} - \\frac{49}{15} = \\frac{120}{15} - \\frac{49}{15} = \\frac{120 - 49}{15} = \\frac{71}{15}$$\nThe number $71$ is prime and does not divide $15$, so the fraction is in its simplest form.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{71}{15}}$$", "id": "3237674"}]}
