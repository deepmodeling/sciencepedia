The problem is based on established principles.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The modification to the algorithm is clearly specified. The question asks for the asymptotic time complexity, which is a standard measure of algorithm performance. A unique answer for the asymptotic bound can be derived.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, technical language. There are no subjective or ambiguous terms in the core problem description.\n4.  **Complete and Consistent:** The description provides all necessary components to analyze the algorithm's performance: the base algorithm, the specific modification, the constraint on the gap sequence (ending in $1$), and the performance metric to be evaluated (asymptotic time). There are no internal contradictions.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The analysis can proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe performance of standard Shell sort with good gap sequences (achieving sub-quadratic time, e.g., $O(n^{3/2})$, $O(n \\log^2 n)$) relies crucially on a property of the internal sorting primitive: **adaptivity**.\n\n1.  **Standard Shell Sort (with Insertion Sort):**\n    - Insertion sort is an **adaptive** algorithm. Its time complexity for an array of size $m$ is $O(m+I)$, where $I$ is the number of inversions. For a nearly sorted array, $I$ is small, and insertion sort runs in nearly linear time, i.e., close to $O(m)$.\n    - In Shell sort, after an array has been $h_k$-sorted, it exhibits a certain degree of \"sortedness.\" When the next, smaller gap $h_{k+1}$ is used, the interleaved subsequences that need to be sorted are already nearly sorted.\n    - Because insertion sort is adaptive, it can sort these nearly sorted subsequences very efficiently. This efficiency is what allows the total running time to be significantly better than $\\Theta(n^2)$.\n\n2.  **Modified Shell Sort (with Selection Sort):**\n    - Selection sort is a **non-adaptive** algorithm. For an array of size $m$, its time complexity is always $\\Theta(m^2)$, irrespective of the initial order of the elements. This is because it must scan the entire remaining unsorted portion of the array to find the next minimum element, a process it repeats $m-1$ times. The number of comparisons is always $(m-1) + (m-2) + \\dots + 1 = \\frac{m(m-1)}{2}$, which is $\\Theta(m^2)$.\n    - The problem statement specifies that the gap sequence ends with $h_t = 1$.\n    - The final pass of the algorithm is therefore a $1$-sort. A $1$-sort involves sorting one subsequence: the entire array of size $n$.\n    - In this modified algorithm, this final pass is performed by **selection sort**.\n    - The time complexity of applying selection sort to the entire array of size $n$ is $\\Theta(n^2)$. This is true even if the array is already perfectly sorted, as selection sort's performance does not adapt to presortedness.\n    - The total time complexity of the algorithm is the sum of the costs of all passes: $T(n) = \\sum_{i=1}^{t} \\text{Cost}(h_i\\text{-sort})$.\n    - The cost of the final pass is $\\text{Cost}(h_t\\text{-sort}) = \\text{Cost}(1\\text{-sort}) = \\Theta(n^2)$.\n    - Since the cost of the final pass alone is $\\Theta(n^2)$, and the costs of all other passes are non-negative, the total time complexity of the algorithm must be at least $\\Omega(n^2)$.\n    - An upper bound for any pass is also $O(n^2)$, so the total complexity is $\\Theta(n^2)$.\n    - This holds for any input, including average-case random inputs and worst-case inputs, because selection sort's performance is input-independent. The \"sorting\" work done by the earlier passes with $h > 1$ is rendered asymptotically irrelevant because the final pass is non-adaptive and costs $\\Theta(n^2)$ regardless.\n\nThe mention of stability is a distractor. While selection sort is unstable and this change would make the overall algorithm unstable (unlike one using a stable insertion sort), stability is a property of the output permutation, not directly related to the asymptotic time complexity in this context. The dominant factor is the loss of adaptivity.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The asymptotic time bound remains subquadratic for good gap sequences, because $h$-sorting reduces disorder regardless of the $h$-sort’s adaptivity; only stability is affected.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement is fundamentally incorrect. While $h$-sorting does reduce disorder (makes the array $h$-sorted), the key to Shell sort's subquadratic performance is that the sorting primitive for the subsequences (the $h$-sort) must be *adaptive*. Because selection sort is not adaptive, the final pass with $h=1$ will cost $\\Theta(n^2)$ time, which makes the entire algorithm $\\Theta(n^2)$. The benefit of reduced disorder is lost on a non-adaptive final pass.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The algorithm loses adaptivity and runs in $\\Theta(n^2)$ time in both average and worst case for any gap sequence that ends with $h = 1$, since the final $h = 1$ pass with selection sort costs $\\Theta(n^2)$ irrespective of presortedness.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement accurately identifies the core issue. The replacement of insertion sort with selection sort means the algorithm loses adaptivity. As established in the derivation, the final pass for $h=1$ consists of sorting the entire array of size $n$ using selection sort. This single step costs $\\Theta(n^2)$ time regardless of the input's presortedness. This cost dominates the entire algorithm's complexity, making the total run time $\\Theta(n^2)$ for any case (average or worst) and for any gap sequence that terminates at $1$.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The algorithm improves to $\\Theta(n \\log n)$ time because selection sort performs $O(n)$ swaps, and swaps dominate the cost in Shell sort.**\n- **Analysis:** This claim is incorrect on several grounds. First, the algorithm's performance degrades to $\\Theta(n^2)$, it does not improve. Second, in selection sort, the number of comparisons, $\\Theta(m^2)$ for a list of size $m$, dominates the number of swaps, $O(m)$. Therefore, it is incorrect to assume swaps dominate the cost. The best-known average-case complexity for standard Shell sort is much better than $\\Theta(n^2)$ but not as good as $\\Theta(n \\log n)$. This option misidentifies the dominant operation in selection sort and incorrectly concludes an improvement in performance.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The running time becomes $\\Theta\\!\\big(n^2 / \\log n\\big)$ for the original Shell gaps $n/2, n/4, \\dots, 1$, because each $h$-pass costs $\\Theta(n^2 / h)$ and there are $\\Theta(\\log n)$ passes.**\n- **Analysis:** The reasoning in this option is flawed. The cost of an $h$-pass using selection sort is derived from sorting $h$ subsequences, each of size approximately $n/h$. The cost is $h \\times \\Theta((n/h)^2) = \\Theta(n^2/h)$. For Shell's original gaps $h_k \\approx n/2^k$, the total cost is $\\sum_{k=1}^{\\log_2 n} \\Theta(n^2 / (n/2^k)) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\log_2 n} \\Theta(n \\cdot 2^k)$. This is a geometric series whose sum is dominated by the last term, where $k=\\log_2 n$, giving $h=1$. The cost of this last term is $\\Theta(n \\cdot 2^{\\log_2 n}) = \\Theta(n \\cdot n) = \\Theta(n^2)$. Thus, the sum is $\\Theta(n^2)$, not $\\Theta(n^2 / \\log n)$. A simpler argument, as used in the main derivation and in option B, is that the final pass alone costs $\\Theta(n^2)$, which is sufficient to establish the overall complexity.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "3270031"}, {"introduction": "While an adaptive inner sort is the engine, the gap sequence is the conductor's baton, directing the entire sorting process.

You will implement Shell Sort, instrument it to measure key performance metrics, and empirically compare two of the most famous gap sequences—one from Donald Knuth and another from Marcin Ciura—to see for yourself how this theoretical choice translates into tangible performance differences.", "problem": "You are to implement a complete program that measures the operation counts of Shell sort on reverse-sorted arrays using two distinct gap sequences. The goal is to compare the number of element comparisons versus the number of data movements for Ciura's gap sequence and Donald Knuth's gap sequence, and to aggregate the results across multiple array sizes.\n\nStart from the following fundamental base in data structures and algorithms: Shell sort is a generalization of insertion sort that improves performance by first sorting elements far apart using a sequence of gaps and gradually reducing the gap to $1$. For any fixed gap $h$, the algorithm performs insertion sort on the subsequences formed by elements at indices separated by $h$. The correctness of insertion sort relies on its loop invariant: before inserting a selected element (the \"key\") into the left portion, that portion is sorted, and insertion preserves order. This observation extends to Shell sort by applying insertion sort to $h$-spaced subsequences.\n\nThe definitions to be used are as follows:\n- A reverse-sorted array of length $n$ is the array $[n,n-1,\\dots,2,1]$ when $n \\ge 1$, and the empty array when $n=0$.\n- A key comparison is counted each time a comparison between two array elements is evaluated, specifically the predicate $A[j-h] > \\text{temp}$ during the $h$-insertion process. Only element-to-element comparisons are counted; index boundary checks such as $j \\ge h$ are not counted.\n- A data movement is counted as a write to an array index. This includes each shift $A[j] \\leftarrow A[j-h]$ and the final placement $A[j] \\leftarrow \\text{temp}$ on every insertion. Even if no shift occurs and the element is written back to its original position, that write is counted as one data movement.\n- Ciura's gap sequence is defined by the base list $\\{1,4,10,23,57,132,301,701\\}$ and extended multiplicatively for larger $n$ by $h_{\\text{next}}=\\left\\lfloor 2.25 \\cdot h \\right\\rfloor$ until exceeding $n$, then used in descending order with all $h \\le n$.\n- Donald Knuth's gap sequence is defined by $h_0=1$ and $h_{k+1}=3h_k+1$, enumerated until exceeding $n$, and used in descending order with all $h \\le n$.\n\nImplement Shell sort with instrumentation that counts the number of comparisons and the number of data movements as defined above. Apply it to reverse-sorted arrays of the following sizes:\n- $n \\in \\{0,1,8,23,100,1000\\}$.\n\nFor each array size $n$, compute the following seven integers:\n- $n$,\n- $C_{\\text{Ciura}}$, the number of comparisons using Ciura's sequence,\n- $M_{\\text{Ciura}}$, the number of data movements using Ciura's sequence,\n- $C_{\\text{Knuth}}$, the number of comparisons using Knuth's sequence,\n- $M_{\\text{Knuth}}$, the number of data movements using Knuth's sequence,\n- $\\Delta C = C_{\\text{Ciura}} - C_{\\text{Knuth}}$,\n- $\\Delta M = M_{\\text{Ciura}} - M_{\\text{Knuth}}$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective task within the domain of algorithm analysis. The definitions, constraints, and objectives are clear and sufficient to produce a unique, computable solution.\n\nThe problem requires the implementation of the Shell sort algorithm, instrumented to count key comparisons and data movements. This implementation is then applied to reverse-sorted arrays of specified sizes, using two different gap sequences: one by Ciura and one by Donald Knuth. The results are then aggregated and formatted.\n\nThe solution is structured as follows:\n$1$. Implementation of the instrumented Shell sort algorithm.\n$2$. Implementation of the generation logic for the specified gap sequences.\n$3$. Execution of the algorithm for each test case and collation of the results.\n\n**$1$. Instrumented Shell Sort Algorithm**\n\nThe Shell sort algorithm sorts an array $A$ of size $n$ by performing a series of gapped insertion sorts. For a given sequence of gaps $h_k, h_{k-1}, \\dots, h_1=1$ used in descending order, the algorithm iterates through each gap $h$. For each $h$, it effectively performs an insertion sort on $h$ independent subsequences. The elements of these subsequences are at indices $(i, i+h, i+2h, \\dots)$ for starting positions $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, h-1\\}$.\n\nThe core of the algorithm is the $h$-sort pass. For each element $A[i]$ where $i \\ge h$, we treat it as a key to be inserted into the sorted subsequence of elements preceding it at intervals of $h$.\n\nLet $A$ be the array of size $n$. Let `gaps` be the list of gaps in descending order. The procedure is:\nFor each gap $h$ in `gaps`:\n  For each index $i$ from $h$ to $n-1$:\n    $1$. Store the element to be inserted: $\\text{temp} \\leftarrow A[i]$.\n    $2$. Initialize the insertion index: $j \\leftarrow i$.\n    $3$. Shift elements that are larger than `temp` to the right by $h$ positions. While $j \\ge h$ and $A[j-h] > \\text{temp}$:\n       - The comparison $A[j-h] > \\text{temp}$ is counted. Let the total comparison count be $C$. Each time this predicate is evaluated, we increment $C$.\n       - The shift operation $A[j] \\leftarrow A[j-h]$ is a data movement. Let the total movement count be $M$. Each such assignment increments $M$.\n       - Move to the next position for insertion: $j \\leftarrow j - h$.\n    $4$. After the loop, if another comparison occurs that terminates the loop (i.e., $A[j-h] \\le \\text{temp}$), that comparison is also counted.\n    $5$. Place the `temp` element in its correct sorted position: $A[j] \\leftarrow \\text{temp}$. This is the final data movement for the current insertion, so $M$ is incremented.\n\nThe process is instrumented as follows:\n- **Comparison Count ($C$)**: Incremented each time the predicate $A[j-h] > \\text{temp}$ is evaluated.\n- **Data Movement Count ($M$)**: Incremented for each write to the array, which includes every shift $A[j] \\leftarrow A[j-h]$ and the final placement $A[j] \\leftarrow \\text{temp}$.\n\nA copy of the initial reverse-sorted array is created for each of the two gap sequences to ensure that both sorting procedures operate on identical initial data.\n\n**$2$. Gap Sequence Generation**\n\nTwo gap sequences are specified:\n\n**Ciura's Gap Sequence**:\nThis sequence is based on experimental data. The base sequence is $\\{1, 4, 10, 23, 57, 132, 301, 701\\}$. For an array of size $n$, the sequence is extended multiplicatively. The generation proceeds by taking the last generated gap $h_k$ and calculating the next as $h_{k+1} = \\lfloor 2.25 \\cdot h_k \\rfloor$. This extension continues until a gap is generated that exceeds $n$. The final sequence to be used consists of all generated gaps that are less than or equal to $n$, sorted in descending order.\n\nFor a given $n$, the procedure is:\n$1$. Initialize a list of gaps with the base values: `gaps` $\\leftarrow \\{1, 4, 10, 23, 57, 132, 301, 701\\}$.\n$2$. Let $h$ be the largest value in `gaps`.\n$3$. While $h \\le n$, calculate $\\text{next\\_h} \\leftarrow \\lfloor 2.25 \\cdot h \\rfloor$. If $\\text{next\\_h} > h$, append it to `gaps` and update $h \\leftarrow \\text{next\\_h}$. Otherwise, stop extending.\n$4$. Filter the generated list to retain only gaps $g \\le n$.\n$5$. Return the filtered list sorted in descending order.\n\n**Donald Knuth's Gap Sequence**:\nThis sequence is defined by the recurrence relation $h_{k+1} = 3h_k + 1$ with $h_0 = 1$. The sequence is generated up to, but not including, the first value that exceeds the array size $n$.\nThe sequence is $\\{1, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, \\dots\\}$.\n\nFor a given $n$, the procedure is:\n$1$. Initialize `gaps` $\\leftarrow []$ and $h \\leftarrow 1$.\n$2$. While $h \\le n$, append $h$ to `gaps` and update $h \\leftarrow 3h+1$.\n$3$. Return `gaps` sorted in descending order.\n\n**$3$. Experimental Execution and Output**\n\nThe program executes the instrumented Shell sort for each array size $n \\in \\{0, 1, 8, 23, 100, 1000\\}$. For each $n$:\n$1$. A reverse-sorted array $A = [n, n-1, \\dots, 1]$ is created. For $n=0$, $A$ is empty.\n$2$. Ciura's and Knuth's gap sequences are generated for the size $n$.\n$3$. The instrumented sort is run twice on a copy of $A$: once with Ciura's gaps to obtain $C_{\\text{Ciura}}$ and $M_{\\text{Ciura}}$, and once with Knuth's gaps for $C_{\\text{Knuth}}$ and $M_{\\text{Knuth}}$.\n$4$. The differences $\\Delta C = C_{\\text{Ciura}} - C_{\\text{Knuth}}$ and $\\Delta M = M_{\\text{Ciura}} - M_{\\text{Knuth}}$ are calculated.\n$5$.

Implement the insertion process by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements at distance $g_t$ while moving a key leftward until the local invariant holds, and count each such adjacent exchange as one swap.\n- Define the average swaps per inserted position $$a_t = \\begin{cases} \\dfrac{s_t}{n - g_t}  \\text{if } n - g_t  0, \\\\ 0  \\text{if } n - g_t = 0. \\end{cases}$$\n- Choose the next gap $g_{t+1}$ by the following adaptive rule:\n$$\ng_{t+1} = \\begin{cases}\n0  \\text{if } g_t = 1 \\text{ (terminate after this pass)}, \\\\\n\\max\\!\\left(1, \\left\\lfloor \\dfrac{g_t}{4} \\right\\rfloor\\right)  \\text{if } s_t = 0, \\\\\n\\max\\!\\left(1, \\left\\lfloor \\dfrac{g_t}{3} \\right\\rfloor\\right)  \\text{if } 0  a_t  1, \\\\\n\\max\\!\\left(1, \\left\\lfloor \\dfrac{g_t}{2} \\right\\rfloor\\right)  \\text{if } a_t \\ge 1.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis rule reduces the gap more aggressively when little work is needed (few swaps) and more conservatively when much work is needed (many swaps), ensuring a monotone decrease to $g=1$ and termination.\n\nTask:\n- Implement the adaptive Shell Sort described above to sort in ascending order.\n- For each input list, output a list containing the sorted list, the total number of swaps over all passes, and the total number of passes executed (that is, the number of distinct gap values used, including the final pass at gap $g=1$ when applicable).\n- The algorithm must not rely on any external randomness and must be stable with respect to the specified mechanics of gapped insertion by adjacent swaps.\n\nTest suite:\nUse the following lists as input test cases.

No subjective elements are present.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe design of the adaptive Shell Sort algorithm is based on fundamental principles of comparison-based sorting. The algorithm generalizes Insertion Sort, which works by iteratively building a sorted prefix of a list. The core invariant of Insertion Sort is that at each step $i$, the sublist from index $0$ to $i$ is sorted. Shell Sort improves upon this by first sorting elements that are far apart, then progressively reducing the gap between elements being compared and exchanged. This is equivalent to performing Insertion Sort on multiple interleaved sublists. A pass with gap $g$ involves performing an independent Insertion Sort on each of the $g$ sublists formed by elements at indices $k, k+g, k+2g, \\ldots$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, g-1\\}$.\n\nThe algorithm is structured into a main function, `adaptive_shell_sort`, which orchestrates the sorting process, and a helper function, `gapped_insertion_sort`, which executes a single pass for a given gap.\n\nThe main function `adaptive_shell_sort` initializes the total swap count $s_{total}$ and pass count $p_{total}$ to $0$. It handles the trivial edge cases where the list length $n$ is less than or equal to $1$, for which the list is already sorted, and returns $0$ swaps and $0$ passes. For non-trivial cases, it calculates the initial gap $g_0 = \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$. The sorting proceeds in a loop that continues as long as the current gap $g_t  0$.\n\nInside the loop, a single pass is executed:\n$1$. The pass counter $p_{total}$ is incremented.\n$2$. The `gapped_insertion_sort` helper is called with the current list and gap $g_t$. This function sorts the interleaved sublists in-place and returns the number of swaps performed, $s_t$.\n$3$. The pass swap count $s_t$ is added to the total swap count $s_{total}$.\n$4$. The next gap, $g_{t+1}$, is calculated according to the specified adaptive rule. First, the termination condition is checked: if $g_t = 1$, the list is now fully sorted, so the next gap is set to $0$ to exit the loop. Otherwise, $g_{t+1}$ is determined based on the work done in the current pass, measured by $s_t$.\n    - If $s_t = 0$, the list was already $g_t$-sorted, indicating a high degree of order. The gap is reduced aggressively: $g_{t+1} = \\max(1, \\lfloor g_t/4 \\rfloor)$.\n    - If $s_t  0$, the average swaps per inserted element, $a_t = s_t / (n - g_t)$, is calculated. The denominator $n - g_t$ represents the number of elements that are potentially moved during the gapped insertion sort (elements at indices $g_t, \\ldots, n-1$).\n    - If $0  a_t  1$, a moderate amount of work was done. The gap is reduced as $g_{t+1} = \\max(1, \\lfloor g_t/3 \\rfloor)$.\n    - If $a_t \\ge 1$, a significant amount of work was done, suggesting the list was highly disordered relative to the gap. The gap is reduced conservatively to allow for more comparisons in the next pass: $g_{t+1} = \\max(1, \\lfloor g_t/2 \\rfloor)$.\nThe use of $\\max(1, \\ldots)$ ensures the gap does not prematurely become $0$ and that the final pass is always at $g=1$.\n\nThe helper function `gapped_insertion_sort(arr, gap)` implements the sorting for a pass. It iterates through the list from index $i = \\text{gap}$ to $n-1$. For each element `arr[i]`, it is inserted into its correct position within its interleaved sublist. The problem specifies that this insertion must be performed by \"repeatedly swapping adjacent elements at distance $g_t$\". This is implemented by an inner loop that compares `arr[j]` with `arr[j - gap]` and swaps them if they are out of order, decrementing $j$ by `gap` until the element is in its sorted position. Each such swap is counted, and the total is returned.\n\nThe overall process is deterministic and terminates because the gap sequence is strictly decreasing for $g_t  1$ and is bounded below by $1$, eventually reaching $1$ and then $0$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef gapped_insertion_sort(arr, gap):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a gapped insertion sort on the list `arr` for a given `gap`.\n    The list is modified in-place.\n    Returns the total number of swaps performed.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(arr)\n    swaps = 0\n    # Iterate through the elements starting from the first element of the second sub-sequence\n    for i in range(gap, n):\n        # Perform insertion sort for the element at index i into its sub-array.\n        # This is done by repeatedly swapping with the element `gap` positions before it.\n        j = i\n        while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > arr[j]:\n            arr[j], arr[j - gap] = arr[j - gap], arr[j]\n            swaps += 1\n            j -= gap\n    return swaps\n\ndef adaptive_shell_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list of integers using an adaptive Shell Sort algorithm.\n    Returns the sorted list, total swaps, and total passes.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(arr)\n    if n = 1:\n        return arr, 0, 0\n\n    total_swaps = 0\n    total_passes = 0\n    current_gap = n // 2\n\n    while current_gap > 0:\n        total_passes += 1\n        \n        pass_swaps = gapped_insertion_sort(arr, current_gap)\n        total_swaps += pass_swaps\n\n        if current_gap == 1:\n            current_gap = 0  # Terminate after this pass\n        else:\n            s_t = pass_swaps\n            if s_t == 0:\n                current_gap = max(1, current_gap // 4)\n            else:\n                # The problem asks to calculate a_t if n - current_gap > 0\n                # In this loop, since n > 1 and current_gap starts at n // 2 and decreases,\n                # n - current_gap will always be > 0.\n                a_t = s_t / (n - current_gap)\n                if 0  a_t  1:\n                    current_gap = max(1, current_gap // 3)\n                else:  # a_t >= 1 or a_t = 0.
