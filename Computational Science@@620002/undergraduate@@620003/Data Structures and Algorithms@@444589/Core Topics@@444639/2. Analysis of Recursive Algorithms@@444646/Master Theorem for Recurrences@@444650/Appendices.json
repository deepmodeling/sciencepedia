The recurrences are in the standard form $T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)$, for which a systematic method of solution, the Master Theorem, exists. The provided information (recurrence relations, base cases, constraints on $n$) is complete, consistent, and sufficient to derive a unique solution for the asymptotic bounds. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any principles of mathematics or computer science. Therefore, the problem statement is valid.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of Asymptotic Bounds\n\nThe provided recurrences are of the form $T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)$. The asymptotic behavior of such recurrences can be determined using the Master Theorem. The theorem compares the function $f(n)$ to the term $n^{\\log_b a}$, which represents the rate of growth of the number of subproblems.\n\nFor both recurrences, we have $a=4$ and $b=2$. We compute the critical exponent:\n$$\n\\log_b a = \\log_2 4 = 2\n$$\nSo, for both problems, we will compare the non-recursive work term, $f(n)$, to $n^2$.\n\n**Analysis of $T_1(n)$:**\nThe recurrence is $T_1(n)=4\\,T_1(n/2)+n^{1.9}$.\nHere, $f_1(n) = n^{1.9}$.\nWe compare $f_1(n)$ with $n^{\\log_b a} = n^2$.\nThe exponent of $f_1(n)$ is $1.9$, which is less than the critical exponent $2$.\nSpecifically, $f_1(n) = n^{1.9} = O(n^{2 - \\epsilon})$ for some constant $\\epsilon > 0$. For instance, we can choose $\\epsilon = 0.1$, which gives $n^{1.9} = O(n^{1.9})$.\nThis corresponds to **Case 1** of the Master Theorem, which states that if $f(n) = O(n^{\\log_b a - \\epsilon})$, then $T(n) = \\Theta(n^{\\log_b a})$.\nApplying this case, we conclude:\n$$\nT_1(n) = \\Theta(n^2)\n$$\nIn this situation, the growth is dominated by the cost at the leaves of the recursion tree.\n\n**Analysis of $T_2(n)$:**\nThe recurrence is $T_2(n)=4\\,T_2(n/2)+n^{2.1}$.\nHere, $f_2(n) = n^{2.1}$.\nWe compare $f_2(n)$ with $n^{\\log_b a} = n^2$.\nThe exponent of $f_2(n)$ is $2.1$, which is greater than the critical exponent $2$.\nSpecifically, $f_2(n) = n^{2.1} = \\Omega(n^{2 + \\epsilon})$ for some constant $\\epsilon > 0$. For instance, we can choose $\\epsilon = 0.1$, which gives $n^{2.1} = \\Omega(n^{2.1})$.\nThis points to **Case 3** of the Master Theorem. For this case to apply, we must also satisfy the regularity condition: $a f(n/b) \\leq c f(n)$ for some constant $c  1$ and for all sufficiently large $n$.\nLet's verify this condition for $T_2(n)$:\n$$\na f_2(n/b) = 4 \\cdot (n/2)^{2.1} = 4 \\cdot \\frac{n^{2.1}}{2^{2.1}} = \\frac{4}{2^{2.1}} \\cdot n^{2.1}\n$$\nWe require a constant $c = \\frac{4}{2^{2.1}}  1$. Since $2^{2.1} > 2^2 = 4$, the fraction $\\frac{4}{2^{2.1}}$ is indeed less than $1$. The regularity condition is satisfied.\nCase 3 of the Master Theorem states that if $f(n) = \\Omega(n^{\\log_b a + \\epsilon})$ and the regularity condition holds, then $T(n) = \\Theta(f(n))$.\nApplying this case, we conclude:\n$$\nT_2(n) = \\Theta(n^{2.1})\n$$\nIn this situation, the growth is dominated by the cost of the work at the root of the recursion tree.\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n- $T_1(n) = \\Theta(n^2)$\n- $T_2(n) = \\Theta(n^{2.1})$\n\n### Step 3: Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nNow I will evaluate each provided option based on the derived results.\n\n**A. $T_1(n)=\\Theta(n^{2})$ and $T_2(n)=\\Theta(n^{2.1})$, hence $T_2(n)$ asymptotically dominates $T_1(n)$.**\n- The statement $T_1(n)=\\Theta(n^2)$ is correct, as derived from Case 1 of the Master Theorem.\n- The statement $T_2(n)=\\Theta(n^{2.1})$ is correct, as derived from Case 3 of the Master Theorem.\n- The conclusion that \"$T_2(n)$ asymptotically dominates $T_1(n)$\" is also correct. Asymptotic dominance means $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{T_1(n)}{T_2(n)} = 0$.

The function $n^{2.1}$ grows strictly faster than $n^2$.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $T_1(n)=\\Theta(n^{2}\\log n)$ and $T_2(n)=\\Theta(n^{2.1})$, hence $T_2(n)$ asymptotically dominates $T_1(n)$.**\n- The statement $T_1(n)=\\Theta(n^{2}\\log n)$ is incorrect. This solution corresponds to Case 2 of the Master Theorem, which would apply if $f_1(n) = \\Theta(n^2)$. However, $f_1(n) = n^{1.9}$, which is polynomially smaller than $n^2$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $T_1(n)=\\Theta(n^{2})$ and $T_2(n)=\\Theta(n^{2}\\log n)$, hence $T_2(n)$ dominates only by a logarithmic factor.**\n- The statement $T_2(n)=\\Theta(n^2 \\log n)$ is incorrect. This solution corresponds to Case 2 of the Master Theorem, which would apply if $f_2(n) = \\Theta(n^2)$.

As shown by Case 1 analysis, the solution is $\\Theta(n^2)$. The growth is determined by the term $n^{\\log_b a}$, not the non-recursive term $f_1(n)=n^{1.9}$.\n- The claim that \"in both recurrences the non-recursive term determines the growth\" is false because it is not true for $T_1(n)$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. $T_1(n)$ and $T_2(n)$ are both $\\Theta(n^{2})$.**\n- The statement that $T_2(n) = \\Theta(n^2)$ is incorrect. As per our analysis, $T_2(n) = \\Theta(n^{2.1})$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the a-nalysis, option A is the only one that correctly describes the asymptotic behavior of both recurrences and their relationship.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3248627"}, {"introduction": "Having explored scenarios where one cost component dominates the other, we now turn to the critical \"balanced\" case.
