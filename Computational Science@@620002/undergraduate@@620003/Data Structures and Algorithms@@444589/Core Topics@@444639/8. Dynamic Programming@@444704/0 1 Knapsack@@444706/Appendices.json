No rounding is required.", "solution": "The user has provided a valid problem statement.\n\nThe problem is an instance of the classic $0/1$ knapsack problem, which is a well-defined combinatorial optimization problem. The provided data are self-contained and consistent. The request is to apply the standard dynamic programming (DP) algorithm and audit its behavior under a specific condition where the knapsack capacity is smaller than any of the item weights. This is a legitimate and scientifically grounded query to test the understanding of the algorithm's mechanics, particularly its base cases and recurrence logic.\n\nThe $0/1$ knapsack problem is formally stated as follows: given a set of $n$ items, each with a weight $w_i > 0$ and a value $v_i > 0$, and a knapsack of total capacity $W$, the goal is to find the subset of items that maximizes the total value, subject to the constraint that the sum of the weights of the selected items does not exceed $W$.\n\nThe standard dynamic programming solution involves creating a table, which we denote as $dp$, of size $(n+1) \\times (W+1)$. The state $dp(i, j)$ represents the maximum value that can be achieved using a subset of the first $i$ items (from item $1$ to item $i$) with a knapsack of capacity $j$.\n\nThe recurrence relation is defined as:\n$$\ndp(i, j) =\n\\begin{cases}\ndp(i-1, j), & \\text{if } w_i > j \\\\\n\\max(dp(i-1, j), v_i + dp(i-1, j-w_i)), & \\text{if } w_i \\le j\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nfor $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ and $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, W\\}$.\n\nThe base cases for the recurrence are:\n1. $dp(0, j) = 0$ for all $j \\in \\{0, \\dots, W\\}$. This corresponds to having no items to choose from, so the total value is always $0$, regardless of the knapsack capacity.\n2. $dp(i, 0) = 0$ for all $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, n\\}$. This corresponds to a knapsack with capacity $0$, which cannot hold any item with a positive weight, so the total value is always $0$.\n\nThe given problem instance provides the following parameters:\n- Number of items: $n = 5$\n- Knapsack capacity: $W = 6$\n- Item weights: $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (7, 9, 11, 13, 15)$\n- Item values: $(v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5) = (10, 14, 20, 26, 31)$\n\nThe final answer is the value of $dp(n, W) = dp(5, 6)$.\n\nA critical observation for this specific instance is that the weight of every item is greater than the knapsack capacity. The minimum weight is $\\min_{i \\in \\{1, \\dots, 5\\}} w_i = w_1 = 7$. Since $W=6$, it is a fact that for all items $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, 5\\}$, the condition $w_i > W$ holds. Consequently, for any subproblem with capacity $j \\le W$, the condition $w_i > j$ will always be true.\n\nThis means that for all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, 5\\}$ and for all $j \\in \\{0, \\dots, 6\\}$, only the first case of the recurrence relation will ever be invoked:\n$$\ndp(i, j) = dp(i-1, j)\n$$\nThis is because it is impossible to include any item $i$ in a knapsack of capacity $j \\le 6$, as the item's weight $w_i$ is too large. The DP algorithm correctly captures this fact by stating that the best one can do with the first $i$ items is the same as the best one could do with the first $i-1$ items.\n\nLet us construct the DP table for $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, 5\\}$ and $j \\in \\{0, \\dots, 6\\}$ to demonstrate the process as requested.\n\nStep 0: Initialization (Base Cases)\nThe first row ($i=0$) and the first column ($j=0$) of the table are initialized to $0$.\n$dp(0, j) = 0$ for $j \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n$dp(i, 0) = 0$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\n\nStep 1: Consider item 1 ($i=1$)\nThe weight is $w_1 = 7$. For every capacity $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, 6\\}$, we have $w_1 > j$.\nTherefore, for each $j$, we apply $dp(1, j) = dp(0, j)$.\n$dp(1, 1) = dp(0, 1) = 0$\n$dp(1, 2) = dp(0, 2) = 0$\n...\n$dp(1, 6) = dp(0, 6) = 0$\nThe entire row for $i=1$ remains $0$.\n\nStep 2: Consider item 2 ($i=2$)\nThe weight is $w_2 = 9$. For every capacity $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, 6\\}$, we have $w_2 > j$.\nTherefore, for each $j$, we apply $dp(2, j) = dp(1, j)$.\n$dp(2, 1) = dp(1, 1) = 0$\n$dp(2, 2) = dp(1, 2) = 0$\n...\n$dp(2, 6) = dp(1, 6) = 0$\nThe entire row for $i=2$ remains $0$.\n\nThis pattern continues for all subsequent items.\n\nStep 3: Consider item 3 ($i=3$, $w_3=11$). For all $j \\le 6$, $w_3 > j$, so $dp(3, j) = dp(2, j) = 0$.\nStep 4: Consider item 4 ($i=4$, $w_4=13$). For all $j \\le 6$, $w_4 > j$, so $dp(4, j) = dp(3, j) = 0$.\nStep 5: Consider item 5 ($i=5$, $w_5=15$). For all $j \\le 6$, $w_5 > j$, so $dp(5, j) = dp(4, j) = 0$.\n\nThe propagation is straightforward:\n$dp(5, 6) = dp(4, 6)$ since $w_5 = 15 > 6$.\n$dp(4, 6) = dp(3, 6)$ since $w_4 = 13 > 6$.\n$dp(3, 6) = dp(2, 6)$ since $w_3 = 11 > 6$.\n$dp(2, 6) = dp(1, 6)$ since $w_2 = 9 > 6$.\n$dp(1, 6) = dp(0, 6)$ since $w_1 = 7 > 6$.\n\nFrom the base case, we know that $dp(0, 6) = 0$. Therefore, by this recursive chain, $dp(5, 6) = 0$.\n\nThe complete DP table would be a $6 \\times 7$ matrix (for $i=0..5, j=0..6$) entirely filled with zeros. This correctly reflects the fact that no items can be placed in the knapsack. The optimal total value, $V^{\\ast}$, is the value in the cell $dp(n, W) = dp(5, 6)$.\n\nThus, the optimal total value is $0$. The audit of the DP algorithm's behavior confirms that it correctly handles the case where $W < \\min_{i} w_i$ by systematically propagating the zero-value solution from the base case.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3202252"}, {"introduction": "While dynamic programming guarantees an optimal solution for the $0/1$ knapsack problem, it's often tempting to try a simpler, faster \"greedy\" approach.

After pruning the dominated pairs, we obtain the non-dominated frontier for set $B$, which we call $P_B$:\n$P_B = [(0,0), (4,7), (5,9), (8,15), (9,16), (10,19), (11,23), (13,24), (14,26), (15,30), (16,32), (18,34), (19,38), (20,39), (21,42), (23,45), (24,47), (25,49), (26,51), (28,54), (29,57), (30,58), (33,64), (34,66), (38,73)]$\n\n**3. Combine the Two Frontiers**\n\nNow we combine the two frontiers $P_A$ and $P_B$ to find the maximum value. We need to find a pair $(w_A, v_A) \\in P_A$ and a pair $(w_B, v_B) \\in P_B$ that maximizes $v_A + v_B$ subject to $w_A + w_B \\le 50$.\n\nWe can do this efficiently using a two-pointer approach. We iterate through $P_A$ with a pointer `i` (from smallest to largest weight) and through $P_B$ with a pointer `j` (from largest to smallest weight).\n- Initialize `max_value = 0`, `i = 0`, `j = |P_B| - 1`.\n- While `i  |P_A|` and `j >= 0`:\n    - Let $(w_A, v_A) = P_A[i]$ and $(w_B, v_B) = P_B[j]$.\n    - If $w_A + w_B \\le 50$:\n        - This combination is valid. We update `max_value = max(max_value, v_A + v_B)`.\n        - To find a potentially better solution, we try a larger value from set A, so we increment `i`.\n    - Else ($w_A + w_B > 50$):\n        - The combined weight is too high. We need to try a smaller weight from set B, so we decrement `j`.\n\nFollowing this procedure, we find the maximum value. For instance, when we consider the pair $(w_A, v_A) = (26, 52)$ from $P_A$, the best partner from $P_B$ that fits is $(w_B, v_B) = (24, 47)$, since $26+24=50 \\le 50$. The total value is $52 + 47 = 99$. We update `max_value = 99`. After checking all combinations, the maximum value found is $99$.\n\n**Complexity Explanation**\n\nThe meet-in-the-middle algorithm's efficiency comes from splitting the problem.\n- **Time Complexity**: For each half of $n/2$ items, there are $2^{n/2}$ subsets. The number of enumerated subsets dictates the primary workload. Generating these pairs takes $O(2^{n/2})$ time. Sorting these pairs takes $O(2^{n/2} \\log(2^{n/2}))$, which simplifies to $O(n \\cdot 2^{n/2})$. Combining the two pruned lists takes linear time relative to their sizes, $O(2^{n/2})$. The dominant step is typically sorting, making the overall time complexity $O(n \\cdot 2^{n/2})$. This is a significant improvement over the brute-force $O(n \\cdot 2^n)$.\n- **Space Complexity**: We need to store the lists of (weight, value) pairs for each half. The maximum number of stored pairs for each half is $2^{n/2}$. Therefore, the space complexity is $O(2^{n/2})$.\n\nThe maximum achievable total value is $99$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{99}\n$$", "id": "3202355"}]}
