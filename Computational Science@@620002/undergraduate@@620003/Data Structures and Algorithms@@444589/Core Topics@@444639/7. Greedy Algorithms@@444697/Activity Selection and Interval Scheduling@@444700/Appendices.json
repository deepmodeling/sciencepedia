It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive and apply a solution method. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### **Method Derivation**\n\nThe problem is to find a subset of activities of maximum size such that no two activities in the subset overlap. This is a canonical problem that can be solved optimally using a greedy algorithm. The core idea of the greedy strategy is to make a locally optimal choice at each step that leads to a globally optimal solution.\n\nLet the set of all available activities, after filtering by the container interval, be $\\mathcal{A} = \\{a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n\\}$. Each activity $a_i$ is an interval $[s_i, f_i)$. We seek a subset $\\mathcal{S} \\subseteq \\mathcal{A}$ such that for any two distinct activities $a_i, a_j \\in \\mathcal{S}$, they are compatible, and $|\\mathcal{S}|$ is maximized.\n\nThe greedy choice that yields an optimal solution is to always select the activity that finishes earliest. This choice leaves the maximum amount of time available for other activities.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Filter the initial set of candidate activities to retain only those fully contained within the container interval $[S, F)$. An activity $[s, f)$ is valid if $S \\le s < f \\le F$.\n2.  Sort the valid activities in non-decreasing order of their finish times. Let the sorted list be $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_m$.\n3.  Initialize the solution set $\\mathcal{S}$ to be empty. Initialize a variable, $k$, representing the finish time of the last activity added to the schedule. To respect the container start, we can initialize $k$ to $S$.\n4.  Iterate through the sorted activities $a_i = [s_i, f_i)$ from $i=1$ to $m$. If an activity $a_i$ starts at or after the last selected activity finishes (i.e., if $s_i \\ge k$), then it is compatible with the current schedule.\n5.  If $a_i$ is compatible, add it to the solution set $\\mathcal{S}$ and update $k$ to the finish time of $a_i$, i.e., $k = f_i$.\n6.  The size of the final set $\\mathcal{S}$, $|\\mathcal{S}|$, is the maximum number of compatible activities.\n\nThis greedy approach is correct. The proof relies on showing that there is an optimal solution that includes the first activity selected by the greedy algorithm (the one with the earliest finish time). By substituting the first activity of any optimal solution with the greedy choice, we can construct another optimal solution of the same size, thus proving the greedy choice is always part of some optimal solution (the greedy-choice property). The problem then reduces to finding an optimal solution for the subproblem of activities that start after the first one finishes, demonstrating optimal substructure.\n\n### **Application to the Concrete Instance**\n\n**1. Filter Activities:**\nWe filter the given $30$ candidate activities based on the container interval $[2, 19)$.

A set of intervals is pairwise compatible if for any two distinct intervals $(s_i, f_i)$ and $(s_j, f_j)$ in the set, either $f_i \\le s_j$ or $f_j \\le s_i$. This condition implies that compatible intervals do not overlap in time.\n\nA crucial property of a set of pairwise compatible intervals is that they can be ordered into a sequence $I_1, I_2, \\ldots, I_m$ such that their start and finish times are strictly increasing: $s_1 < f_1 \\le s_2 < f_2 \\le \\ldots \\le s_m < f_m$. We will call such an ordered sequence a \"chain\".\n\nThe makespan of a schedule $S$ is defined as $M(S) = \\max_{(s_i,f_i)\\in S} f_i - \\min_{(s_i,f_i)\\in S} s_i$. For a chain of $k$ intervals, $I_1, \\ldots, I_k$, the minimum start time is $s_1$ and the maximum finish time is $f_k$. Thus, the makespan is $f_k - s_1$.\n\nThe problem is therefore equivalent to finding a compatible chain of $k$ intervals that minimizes the difference between the finish time of the last interval and the start time of the first interval.\n\n### Algorithmic Strategy\n\nA brute-force approach of checking all $\\binom{N}{k}$ subsets of intervals for compatibility and makespan is computationally prohibitive. A more efficient strategy is required. We can design an algorithm by systematically exploring all potential optimal schedules. An optimal schedule must have a first interval. Our strategy is to iterate through every interval in the input set, considering each one as the potential first interval of an optimal schedule.\n\nLet's fix an interval $I_{start} = (s_{start}, f_{start})$ as the first interval of a schedule. The makespan for any schedule starting with this interval will be $f_{end} - s_{start}$, where $f_{end}$ is the finish time of the last interval in the schedule. To minimize this makespan for a fixed $s_{start}$, we must find a compatible chain of $k-1$ additional intervals, all starting no earlier than $f_{start}$, such that the finish time of the final interval is minimized.\n\nThis subproblemâ€”finding a chain of a specified length with the earliest possible completion timeâ€”can be solved using a greedy approach. The greedy principle for activity selection dictates that to minimize the finish time, one should always select the next compatible activity that has the earliest finish time. This choice ensures that the resource becomes free as early as possible, maximizing the opportunity for subsequent activities and leading to the earliest possible finish for any given chain length.\n\nBy applying this greedy strategy for each potential starting interval, we are guaranteed to find the globally optimal schedule, as we are exhaustively checking the best possible outcome for every possible start.\n\n### Algorithm\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Preprocessing**: Let the set of $N$ input intervals be $\\mathcal{I}$. Create two sorted versions of this set:\n    *   $\\mathcal{I}_{start}$: The set of intervals sorted by non-decreasing start times.\n    *   $\\mathcal{I}_{finish}$: The set of intervals sorted by non-decreasing finish times.\n    The sorting operations take $O(N \\log N)$ time.\n\n2.  **Initialization**: Initialize a variable, `min_makespan`, to a value representing positive infinity (e.g., a sufficiently large number). This variable will store the minimum makespan found so far.\n\n3.  **Main Loop**: Iterate through each interval $I_i \\in \\mathcal{I}_{start}$, treating it as the potential first interval of a $k$-interval chain. Let $I_i = (s_i, f_i)$.\n\n4.  **Greedy Chain Construction**: For each starting interval $I_i$:\n    a. Initialize a chain with $I_i$. The current chain length is $1$, and the finish time of the last element is $f_{last} = f_i$.\n    b. We need to find $k-1$ more intervals. We do this by iterating through the $\\mathcal{I}_{finish}$ list to make efficient greedy choices.\n    c. For each interval $I_j \\in \\mathcal{I}_{finish}$:\n        i. If the start time $s_j$ of $I_j$ is greater than or equal to $f_{last}$, then $I_j$ is compatible with the current chain.\n        ii. We select $I_j$ as the next interval in our chain. Update $f_{last} = f_j$ and increment the chain length.\n        iii. Because $\\mathcal{I}_{finish}$ is sorted by finish times, this greedy choice is optimal for minimizing the finish time at each step.\n    d. If the chain length reaches $k$:\n        i. A valid schedule of size $k$ has been found. The first interval is $I_i$ and the last is the one just added. Its makespan is $f_{last} - s_i$.\n        ii. Update `min_makespan = min(min_makespan, f_{last} - s_i)`.\n        iii. Since we have found the chain with the earliest possible finish time for the starting interval $I_i$ (due to the greedy selection from $\\mathcal{I}_{finish}$), we can break from the inner loop and proceed to the next potential starting interval.\n\n5.  **Final Result**: After the main loop completes, if `min_makespan` is still infinity, it means no schedule of size $k$ could be formed. In this case, the result is $-1$. Otherwise, the result is the integer value of `min_makespan`.\n\nThis algorithm has a time complexity of $O(N^2)$. The initial sorting takes $O(N \\log N)$. The main loop runs $N$ times, and the inner greedy construction loop can run up to $N$ times in the worst case, leading to an $O(N^2)$ complexity for the search phase.

Each window is an interval on a circle of length $T = 24$ hours. The intervals may wrap around the $0$ boundary (for example, an interval from hour $22$ to hour $3$ spans the late night and early morning). Every interval has a nonnegative integer weight, and the goal is to select a subset of intervals that do not overlap, maximizing the sum of their weights.\n\nFoundational base and definitions:\n- A day is modeled as a circle of circumference $T = 24$, with time measured modulo $24$ in integer hours. Each interval is represented as a half-open arc $[s_i, e_i)$ on the circle, with $s_i, e_i \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,23\\}$. The interval contains its start but excludes its end. If $s_i \\le e_i$, the interval is non-wrapping and corresponds to the linear interval $[s_i, e_i)$ on $[0,24)$. If $s_i  e_i$, the interval is wrapping and corresponds to the union $[s_i,24) \\cup [0, e_i)$.\n- Two intervals are considered non-overlapping if the measure of their intersection on the circle is zero; under the half-open convention, touching exactly at an endpoint is allowed and does not constitute overlap.\n- The problem asks for the maximum possible sum of weights over a set of pairwise non-overlapping intervals. The weights are integers.\n\nFrom these definitions (which are standard for interval scheduling), you must reason from first principles to derive a method that handles circularity correctly. You must not rely on any unestablished shortcut; instead, you must:\n- Ground your approach in the standard linear weighted interval scheduling formulation, which on a line uses sorting by end times and dynamic programming based on predecessor indices.\n- Justify how to reduce the circular problem to one or more linear instances without loss of optimality, using only the definitions above and elementary logical deductions about intervals on a circle.\n\nImplementation requirements:\n- Assume $T = 24$. All interval endpoints $s_i$ and $e_i$ are integers in $[0,24)$, and all weights $w_i$ are nonnegative integers.\n- Interpret every interval as half-open $[s_i, e_i)$ on the circle (start included, end excluded), as specified above.\n- Your program must not read any input. It must evaluate a fixed test suite embedded in the program and print the results in the required format.\n\nTest suite:\nFor each test case, you are given a list of triples $(s_i, e_i, w_i)$, where $s_i$ and $e_i$ are start and end hours, and $w_i$ is the weight. All times are in hours, measured modulo $24$.\n\n- Test case $1$ (mixed wrapping and non-wrapping):\n  $[(1,5,4), (4,7,2), (6,10,4), (11,13,2), (22,3,10), (3,6,3), (13,18,8), (18,22,3), (20,2,9)]$.\n- Test case $2$ (only non-wrapping intervals, linear behavior):\n  $[(0,5,5), (1,2,2), (2,4,4), (4,7,3), (6,9,6), (9,12,5)]$.\n- Test case $3$ (all wrapping intervals; at most one can be chosen):\n  $[(22,2,3), (23,1,5), (20,4,7)]$.\n- Test case $4$ (boundary touching; half-open semantics allow chaining):\n  $[(0,6,1), (6,12,1), (12,18,1), (18,0,1)]$.\n- Test case $5$ (trade-off: heavy non-wrapping chain versus a single heavy wrapping interval):\n  $[(1,8,10), (8,16,10), (16,23,10), (20,3,15)]$.\n\nRequired final output:\n- For each test case, compute a single integer: the maximum achievable total weight under the non-overlap constraint on the $24$-hour circle.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example, $[x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5]$ where $x_k$ is the result for test case $k$.", "solution": "The user wants to solve the weighted interval scheduling problem on a circular timeline.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\n**1.1. Extract Givens**\n\n- **Domain**: Time is modeled on a circle of circumference $T = 24$ hours, with time points in $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$.\n- **Intervals**: Each interval $i$ is a half-open arc $[s_i, e_i)$ with a non-negative integer weight $w_i$.\n    - If $s_i \\le e_i$, the interval is non-wrapping: $[s_i, e_i)$.\n    - If $s_i  e_i$, the interval is wrapping: $[s_i, 24) \\cup [0, e_i)$.\n- **Non-overlapping Condition**: Two intervals are non-overlapping if their intersection on the circle has a measure of zero. Touching at an endpoint is permitted.\n- **Objective**: Find a subset of pairwise non-overlapping intervals that maximizes the sum of their weights.\n- **Methodology Constraint**: The solution must be derived from first principles, starting with the standard linear weighted interval scheduling algorithm and justifying the reduction from the circular case.\n- **Test Suite**: Five specific test cases with interval data $(s_i, e_i, w_i)$ are provided.\n\n**1.2. Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded (Critical)**: The problem is a well-established variant of the interval scheduling problem, a classic topic in computer science algorithms and combinatorial optimization. It is grounded in mathematical logic and algorithmic theory. The problem is valid.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem asks for the maximum of a well-defined objective function (total weight) over a clearly specified feasible set (subsets of non-overlapping intervals). A solution is guaranteed to exist as the number of intervals is finite. The problem is valid.\n- **Objective (Critical)**: The definitions of intervals (wrapping and non-wrapping), non-overlapping, and the objective function are precise, mathematical, and free of ambiguity or subjective interpretation. The problem is valid.\n- **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: The problem is self-contained. All necessary definitions, constraints, and data are provided. There are no contradictions. The problem is valid.\n- **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The problem is a mathematical abstraction and does not model a physical system, so physical feasibility is not a relevant criterion. The parameters are mathematically consistent. The problem is valid.\n\n**1.3. Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard, well-posed problem in algorithm design. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution from First Principles\n\nThe problem is to find the maximum weight subset of non-overlapping intervals on a circle. We begin by stating the established solution for the simpler, linear version of this problem, and then we will demonstrate how the circular problem can be reduced to one or more instances of the linear problem.\n\n**2.1. The Linear Weighted Interval Scheduling (WIS) Problem**\n\nThe standard WIS problem considers a set of $n$ intervals on a line, each with a start time $s_i$, finish time $f_i$, and weight $w_i$. The goal is to find a non-overlapping subset of intervals with maximum total weight. The canonical solution uses dynamic programming.\n\n1.  **Sort**: Sort the intervals based on their finish times in non-decreasing order. Let the sorted intervals be $I_1, I_2, \\dots, I_n$.\n\n2.  **Predecessor Function**: For each interval $I_i$, define $p(i)$ as the index of the latest interval $I_j$ (with $j  i$) that is compatible with $I_i$ (i.e., does not overlap). Formally, $p(i) = \\max(\\{j  i \\mid f_j \\le s_i\\} \\cup \\{-1\\})$. The value $-1$ indicates no such predecessor exists. The $p(i)$ values can be computed efficiently for all $i$ using binary search on the sorted finish times.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Programming Recurrence**: Let $DP[i]$ be the maximum weight of a compatible subset of intervals chosen from the first $i$ intervals $\\{I_1, \\dots, I_i\\}$. The recurrence relation is:\n    $$DP[i] = \\max(w_i + DP[p(i)], DP[i-1])$$\n    where we define $DP[-1] = 0$.\n    - The term $DP[i-1]$ represents the optimal solution for the first $i-1$ intervals, which corresponds to the case where interval $I_i$ is *not* included in the solution.\n    - The term $w_i + DP[p(i)]$ represents the case where interval $I_i$ *is* included. Since $I_i$ is included, no conflicting intervals can be. The optimal choice for the remaining compatible intervals must be the optimal solution for the subproblem defined by intervals up to its latest non-conflicting predecessor, $I_{p(i)}$.\n\nThe solution to the linear WIS problem is the value $DP[n]$.\n\n**2.2. Reduction of Circular WIS to Linear WIS**\n\nThe defining feature of the circular problem is the presence of \"wrapping\" intervals, those where $s_i  e_i$. Let the set of all intervals be $\\mathcal{I}$, which is a union of non-wrapping intervals $\\mathcal{I}_{NW}$ ($s_i \\le e_i$) and wrapping intervals $\\mathcal{I}_W$ ($s_i  e_i$).\n\nA crucial observation is that any two wrapping intervals must overlap. A wrapping interval $[s_i, e_i)$ necessarily covers the point $0$ on the circle (i.e., the interval contains the arc $[T- \\epsilon, T) \\cup [0, \\epsilon)$ for some small $\\epsilon  0$). If two wrapping intervals $[s_1, e_1)$ and $[s_2, e_2)$ were in a solution, their union would be $(\\,[s_1, 24) \\cup [0, e_1)\\,) \\cap (\\,[s_2, 24) \\cup [0, e_2)\\,) \\neq \\emptyset$. Therefore, any valid set of non-overlapping intervals can contain **at most one** wrapping interval.\n\nThis observation allows us to partition the search for the optimal solution into mutually exclusive cases:\n\n**Case 1: The optimal solution contains no wrapping intervals.**\nIf the optimal solution consists solely of non-wrapping intervals from $\\mathcal{I}_{NW}$, then all these intervals lie on the linear segment $[0, T)$. The problem is precisely the linear WIS problem for the set of intervals $\\mathcal{I}_{NW}$ on the timeline $[0, T)$. We can solve this using the dynamic programming method described above. Let the result be $W_{linear}$.\n\n**Case 2: The optimal solution contains exactly one wrapping interval.**\nLet the single chosen wrapping interval be $I_j = [s_j, e_j)$ with weight $w_j$, where $s_j  e_j$. By including $I_j$, we are forbidden from selecting any other interval that overlaps with the arc $[s_j, T) \\cup [0, e_j)$. This effectively removes this arc from the circle, leaving a single continuous linear segment $[e_j, s_j)$ available for scheduling. The remaining intervals in the optimal solution must be chosen from the set of non-wrapping intervals that are entirely contained within this segment.\nLet $\\mathcal{S}_j = \\{ I_k \\in \\mathcal{I}_{NW} \\mid e_j \\le s_k \\text{ and } e_k \\le s_j \\}$. The problem reduces to finding the maximum weight of a compatible subset of $\\mathcal{S}_j$, which is a linear WIS problem on the timeline $[e_j, s_j)$.\nLet $W_{sub,j}$ be the solution to this linear subproblem. The total weight for a solution centered around $I_j$ is then $w_j + W_{sub,j}$.\nSince we do not know which wrapping interval (if any) is in the optimal solution, we must perform this calculation for every wrapping interval $I_j \\in \\mathcal{I}_W$.\n\n**Overall Algorithm**\n\nThe maximum total weight for the circular problem is the maximum value found across all these cases.\n\n1.  Initialize $W_{max} = 0$.\n2.  Solve the linear WIS problem for the set of all non-wrapping intervals $\\mathcal{I}_{NW}$ on the range $[0, T)$. Set $W_{max}$ to this result.\n3.  For each wrapping interval $I_j = [s_j, e_j)$ with weight $w_j$ in $\\mathcal{I}_W$:\n    a. Identify the subset of non-wrapping intervals $\\mathcal{S}_j$ that are fully contained in the linear segment $[e_j, s_j)$.\n    b. Solve the linear WIS problem for the set $\\mathcal{S}_j$. Let the result be $W_{sub,j}$.\n    c. Calculate the candidate maximum weight for this case as $W_{candidate} = w_j + W_{sub,j}$.\n    d. Update $W_{max} = \\max(W_{max}, W_{candidate})$.\n4.  The final result is $W_{max}$.\n\nThis procedure is guaranteed to find the optimal solution because it exhaustively considers all valid structural possibilities for an optimal set of intervals on a circle.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import namedtuple\n\n# Define an Interval tuple for better readability\nInterval = namedtuple('Interval', ['start', 'end', 'weight', 'id'])\n\ndef solve_linear_wis(intervals):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the linear weighted interval scheduling problem using dynamic programming.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not intervals:\n        return 0\n\n    # Sort intervals by their end times.\n    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x.end)\n    n = len(intervals)\n\n    # Extract end times for efficient predecessor search.\n    end_times = [i.end for i in intervals]\n\n    # Precompute predecessors using binary search.\n    # p[i] is the index of the latest interval j  i that is compatible with i.\n    p = [-1] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Find the index of the first interval whose end time is > start time of i.\n        # The predecessor is the one just before that.\n        # np.searchsorted(side='right') finds insertion point to maintain order.\n        # Intervals with end_time = intervals[i].start are compatible.\n        j = np.searchsorted(end_times, intervals[i].start, side='right')\n        if j > 0:\n            p[i] = j - 1\n\n    # DP table: dp[i] = max weight for intervals up to i.\n    dp = [0] * n\n    # Base case\n    dp[0] = intervals[0].weight\n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        # Weight if we include the current interval\n        incl_profit = intervals[i].weight\n        pred_idx = p[i]\n        if pred_idx != -1:\n            incl_profit += dp[pred_idx]\n\n        # Weight if we exclude the current interval\n        excl_profit = dp[i-1]\n\n        dp[i] = max(incl_profit, excl_profit)\n\n    return dp[n-1]\n\ndef solve_circular_wis(intervals_raw):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the circular weighted interval scheduling problem by reducing it to\n    multiple linear WIS problems.\n    \"\"\"\n    T = 24\n    \n    if not intervals_raw:\n        return 0\n        \n    intervals = [Interval(s, e, w, i) for i, (s, e, w) in enumerate(intervals_raw)]\n\n    non_wrapping_intervals = [iv for iv in intervals if iv.start = iv.end]\n    wrapping_intervals = [iv for iv in intervals if iv.start > iv.end]\n\n    # Case 1: Optimal solution uses no wrapping intervals.\n    # This is a standard linear WIS problem on [0, T).\n    max_weight = solve_linear_wis(non_wrapping_intervals.copy())\n\n    # Case 2: Optimal solution uses exactly one wrapping interval.\n    # Iterate through each wrapping interval as the one chosen.\n    for wrap_iv in wrapping_intervals:\n        # If we pick wrap_iv, the remaining available time is the linear\n        # segment [wrap_iv.end, wrap_iv.start).\n        # We need to find the optimal schedule for non-wrapping intervals\n        # that fit entirely within this segment.\n        \n        sub_problem_intervals = []\n        for iv in non_wrapping_intervals:\n            # Check if the interval is fully contained in [wrap_iv.end, wrap_iv.start)\n            if iv.start >= wrap_iv.end and iv.end = wrap_iv.start:\n                sub_problem_intervals.append(iv)\n        \n        sub_problem_weight = solve_linear_wis(sub_problem_intervals)\n        \n        current_total_weight = wrap_iv.weight + sub_problem_weight\n        \n        if current_total_weight > max_weight:\n            max_weight = current_total_weight\n            \n    return max_weight\n\ndef solve():\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Test case 1 (mixed wrapping and non-wrapping)\n        [(1, 5, 4), (4, 7, 2), (6, 10, 4), (11, 13, 2), (22, 3, 10), (3, 6, 3), (13, 18, 8), (18, 22, 3), (20, 2, 9)],\n        # Test case 2 (only non-wrapping intervals, linear behavior)\n        [(0, 5, 5), (1, 2, 2), (2, 4, 4), (4, 7, 3), (6, 9, 6), (9, 12, 5)],\n        # Test case 3 (all wrapping intervals; at most one can be chosen)\n        [(22, 2, 3), (23, 1, 5), (20, 4, 7)],\n        # Test case 4 (boundary touching; half-open semantics allow chaining)\n        [(0, 6, 1), (6, 12, 1), (12, 18, 1), (18, 0, 1)],\n        # Test case 5 (trade-off: heavy non-wrapping chain versus a single heavy wrapping interval)\n        [(1, 8, 10), (8, 16, 10), (16, 23, 10), (20, 3, 15)],\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        result = solve_circular_wis(case)\n        results.append(result)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3203016"}]}
