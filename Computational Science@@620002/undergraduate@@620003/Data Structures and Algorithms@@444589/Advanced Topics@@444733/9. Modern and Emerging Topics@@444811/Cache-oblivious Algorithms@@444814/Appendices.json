The algorithms are described adequately for an asymptotic analysis of their memory access patterns.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The analysis can proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe goal is to determine the asymptotic number of cache misses for each algorithm. A cache miss occurs when a requested memory address is not in the cache, necessitating a transfer of a block of $B$ elements from main memory.\n\n**Analysis of the Naive Transpose Algorithm**\n\nThe algorithm is given by the nested loop structure:\n```\nFor i from 0 to N-1:\n  For j from 0 to N-1:\n    B[j][i] <- A[i][j]\n```\nWe analyze the memory accesses for reading from matrix $A$ and writing to matrix $B$ separately. Both matrices are stored in row-major order, meaning that for an $N \\times N$ matrix $X$, the element $X[r][c]$ is located at a memory offset of $r \\times N + c$ from the matrix's base address.\n\n1.  **Reading from Matrix $A$**:\n    The algorithm accesses elements of $A$ in the order $A[0][0], A[0][1], \\dots, A[0][N-1]$, then $A[1][0], \\dots, A[1][N-1]$, and so on. For any fixed row $i$, the inner loop over $j$ scans the elements $A[i][0], \\dots, A[i][N-1]$. These elements are stored contiguously in memory due to the row-major layout. This is a sequential scan.\n    - Each cache miss brings a block of $B$ elements into the cache.\n    - To read a full row of $N$ elements, $\\lceil N/B \\rceil$ blocks must be transferred.\n    - Since this is done for each of the $N$ rows, the total number of misses for reading all of $A$ is $N \\times \\lceil N/B \\rceil$.\n    - Asymptotically, this is $\\Theta(N^2/B)$. This access pattern exhibits excellent spatial locality.\n\n2.  **Writing to Matrix $B$**:\n    The algorithm writes to elements of $B$ in the order $B[0][0], B[1][0], \\dots, B[N-1][0]$, then $B[0][1], \\dots, B[N-1][1]$, and so on. For any fixed outer-loop index $i$, the inner loop over $j$ writes to the elements $B[0][i], B[1][i], \\dots, B[N-1][i]$. These are the elements of column $i$ of matrix $B$.\n    - In row-major order, the memory address of $B[j][i]$ is `base_B` $+ j \\times N + i$. The address of the next element written, $B[j+1][i]$, is `base_B` $+ (j+1) \\times N + i$.\n    - The stride between consecutive memory accesses is $N$ elements.\n    - The problem assumes $N \\ge \\alpha \\cdot M/B$ for some $\\alpha > 0$. This implies $N$ is large. In typical scenarios for which this kind of analysis is relevant, the size of a single column in memory ($N \\times N$ address space for the whole column, though only $N$ elements) far exceeds the cache size $M$.\n    - When the stride $N$ is larger than the block size $B$, each access `B[j][i]` and `B[j+1][i]` will fall into different cache blocks.\n    - Furthermore, if the total number of distinct blocks touched during the traversal of a column exceeds the cache's capacity ($M/B$), blocks will be evicted before they can be reused. The $j$-th access in the inner loop (for fixed $i$) touches a block. The $(j+1)$-th access touches a block $N$ bytes away. By the time we access enough elements to potentially reuse a block (which does not happen in this access pattern anyway), we would have brought in at least $M/B$ other blocks, causing eviction.\n    - Consequently, each of the $N$ writes to a column causes a cache miss. Since the outer loop runs $N$ times, the total number of misses for writing to $B$ is $N \\times N = N^2$.\n    - Asymptotically, this is $\\Theta(N^2)$. This access pattern exhibits extremely poor spatial locality.\n\n**Total Misses for Naive Transpose**:\nThe total number of block transfers is the sum of misses from reading $A$ and writing to $B$:\n$$ \\text{Total Misses} = \\Theta(N^2/B) + \\Theta(N^2) = \\Theta(N^2) $$\nThe cost of writing to $B$ dominates the overall complexity.\n\n**Analysis of the Cache-Oblivious Transpose Algorithm**\n\nThis algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer strategy. An $N \\times N$ matrix is partitioned into four $(N/2) \\times (N/2)$ submatrices. The transpose is then performed by recursively transposing these submatrices.\nThe recurrence for the number of cache misses, $Q(n)$, for an $n \\times n$ subproblem is as follows:\n- If the subproblem is large and does not fit in the cache, the problem is divided. Transposing an $n \\times n$ matrix involves four recursive calls on $(n/2) \\times (n/2)$ submatrices. So, $Q(n) = 4Q(n/2)$.\n- If the subproblem is small enough to fit in the cache, the recursion effectively stops, and the subproblem is solved with an optimal number of memory transfers.\n\nLet's determine the size of the base case. A recursive subproblem on an $n \\times n$ submatrix needs to access an $n \\times n$ portion of $A$ and an $n \\times n$ portion of $B$. These submatrices are not contiguous blocks of memory. An $n\\times n$ submatrix consists of $n$ separate row segments, each of length $n$.\n- The number of blocks occupied by one such $n \\times n$ submatrix is roughly $n \\times \\lceil n/B \\rceil$. For $n>B$, this is $\\Theta(n^2/B)$. For $n \\le B$, this is $\\Theta(n)$.\n- The base case for the recursion occurs when the subproblem is small enough that its constituent parts (from both $A$ and $B$) fit simultaneously into the cache. This allows the small transpose to be performed with maximal data reuse.\n- Let's find the largest side length $n$ for which an $n \\times n$ subproblem from $A$ and one from $B$ fit in cache. The total number of blocks needed is roughly $2 \\times (n \\cdot \\lceil n/B \\rceil)$. We require this to be less than the cache capacity $M/B$.\n- Using the tall-cache assumption ($M = \\Omega(B^2)$), it's known that the transition happens when the subproblem's data footprint is on the order of the cache size $M$. The footprint is roughly $2n^2$ elements. So, we set $c \\cdot n^2 \\approx M$ for some constant $c$, which gives $n \\approx \\sqrt{M}$. Let's denote this crossover size by $n_0 = \\Theta(\\sqrt{M})$.\n- For a subproblem of size $n \\le n_0$, it fits well within the cache. The number of cache misses to load it once is the number of blocks it occupies, which is $\\Theta(n^2/B)$. So, the base case cost is $Q(n_0) = \\Theta(n_0^2/B)$.\n\nWe can now solve the recurrence for the total number of misses for the original $N \\times N$ problem. The recursion proceeds for $k$ levels until the subproblem size $N/2^k$ is on the order of $n_0$.\n$$ \\frac{N}{2^k} \\approx n_0 \\implies 2^k \\approx \\frac{N}{n_0} \\implies k \\approx \\log_2\\left(\\frac{N}{n_0}\\right) $$\nThe number of misses is $Q(N) = 4^k Q(N/2^k) = 4^k Q(n_0)$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $4^k = (2^k)^2 \\approx (N/n_0)^2$ and $Q(n_0)$:\n$$ Q(N) \\approx \\left(\\frac{N}{n_0}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\Theta\\left(\\frac{n_0^2}{B}\\right) = \\frac{N^2}{n_0^2} \\cdot \\Theta\\left(\\frac{n_0^2}{B}\\right) = \\Theta\\left(\\frac{N^2}{B}\\right) $$\nThe cache-oblivious algorithm achieves an optimal number of memory transfers, equivalent to simply scanning the matrices linearly. It automatically adapts to the cache size without knowing it explicitly.\n\n**Summary of Results**:\n- Naive transpose block transfers: $\\Theta(N^2)$\n- Cache-oblivious transpose block transfers: $\\Theta(N^2/B)$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The naive algorithm incurs $\\Theta(N^2)$ block transfers, while the cache-oblivious algorithm incurs $\\Theta(N^2 / B)$ block transfers.**\nThis option matches our derived results for both algorithms. The naive algorithm's performance is limited by strided writes, leading to $\\Theta(N^2)$ misses. The cache-oblivious algorithm's recursive structure ensures good cache locality at all levels of the memory hierarchy, achieving the optimal $\\Theta(N^2/B)$ misses.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Both the naive and the cache-oblivious algorithms incur $\\Theta(N^2 / B)$ block transfers.**\nThis is incorrect. While it correctly states the complexity for the cache-oblivious algorithm, it incorrectly claims the naive algorithm also achieves this performance. The naive algorithm is significantly less efficient due to its memory access pattern for writing to the destination matrix, as shown in the analysis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The naive algorithm incurs $\\Theta(N^2 / B)$ block transfers for reading $A$ and $\\Theta(N^2 / B)$ for writing $B$, totaling $\\Theta(N^2 / B)$, while the cache-oblivious algorithm incurs $\\Theta(N^2 / (B \\sqrt{M}))$ block transfers.**\nThis option is incorrect for several reasons.\n- For the naive algorithm, it correctly states the read cost but incorrectly states the write cost as $\\Theta(N^2/B)$. The write cost is $\\Theta(N^2)$. Thus the total is $\\Theta(N^2)$, not $\\Theta(N^2/B)$.\n- For the cache-oblivious algorithm, it states a complexity of $\\Theta(N^2 / (B \\sqrt{M}))$. This is the well-known cache-oblivious complexity for matrix *multiplication*, not transposition. As derived, the complexity for transposition is $\\Theta(N^2/B)$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The naive algorithm incurs $\\Theta(N^2)$ block transfers, while the cache-oblivious algorithm incurs $\\Theta((N^2 \\log N) / B)$ block transfers due to recursive overhead.**\nThis option correctly states the complexity for the naive algorithm. However, it incorrectly states the complexity for the cache-oblivious algorithm. The recursive structure does not introduce a logarithmic factor in the cache miss complexity for this problem. The analysis shows that the work is concentrated at the leaves of the recursion tree (the base cases that fit in cache), and summing these up does not produce a $\\log N$ term. The correct complexity is $\\Theta(N^2/B)$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3208160"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how to optimize data movement, we now apply cache-oblivious principles to a more complex computational problem: finding the median of a dataset. This practice [@problem_id:3220337] challenges you to design and analyze a selection algorithm based on the classic \"median-of-medians\" strategy.

Consider the cache-oblivious model under an ideal cache with the tall-cache assumption $M \\geq B^{2}$, where algorithms do not know $M$ or $B$ but are analyzed by the number of Input/Output (I/O) block transfers between disk and cache. A sequential pass over an array of size $x$ incurs exactly $x/B$ block transfers; treat reads and writes symmetrically.\n\nDesign a cache-oblivious selection algorithm that returns the median of the $N$ keys. Use the following fundamental facts and constraints:\n\n- The algorithm must be comparison-based and cache-oblivious, arranging its data access pattern into contiguous subarrays without tuning to $M$ or $B$.\n- For pivot selection, use the “median-of-medians” strategy with groups of $5$ keys: form medians of $5$, recursively select the median of the medians, and use that as the pivot.\n- In median-of-medians with group size $5$, assume the well-tested worst-case shrink property: at least $3N/10$ keys are strictly less than the pivot and at least $3N/10$ keys are strictly greater than the pivot. Therefore, the recursive subproblem that contains the median has size at most $7N/10$.\n- At each recursive level, assume the following concrete I/O costs are incurred by cache-oblivious, contiguous, sequential scans:\n  1. One pass to read the $N$ keys and compute medians of $5$ ($N/B$ transfers).\n  2. One pass to write the $N/5$ medians into a separate contiguous buffer ($(N/5)/B$ transfers).\n  3. Two passes to partition the original $N$ keys around the chosen pivot (aggregate $2N/B$ transfers).\n- The recursive selection over the $N/5$ medians and over the at-most-$7N/10$ partition both follow the same scheme and incur I/Os according to the same assumptions.\n\nStarting only from these facts and from first principles of the external memory I/O model and cache-oblivious design, derive a closed-form upper bound on the total number of block transfers $T(N)$ performed by the algorithm as a function of $N$ and $B$. Your derivation must explicitly set up and solve the appropriate recurrence without using shortcut formulas. Briefly discuss why naive recursion patterns could fail to realize the same bound in a cache-oblivious setting (for example, recursing on both partitions or causing non-sequential access), but your final numeric bound must reflect the algorithm above. Express your final bound as a single analytic expression in $N$ and $B$. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of a closed-form upper bound on the total number of block transfers, denoted as $T(N)$, for a cache-oblivious median selection algorithm on an array of $N$ keys. The algorithm uses the median-of-medians method with groups of size $5$. The analysis is performed in the external memory model with a cache of size $M$ and block size $B$, under the tall-cache assumption $M \\geq B^2$.\n\nFirst, we establish the recurrence relation for $T(N)$. The algorithm proceeds in a recursive fashion. At each step, for a problem of size $N$, the following operations are performed:\n\n1.  **Pivot Selection**:\n    a. The input array of size $N$ is scanned to form $\\lceil N/5 \\rceil$ groups of $5$ keys. The median of each group is computed. This requires one sequential pass over the $N$ keys. The number of I/O transfers for this scan is given as $N/B$.\n    b. The $\\lceil N/5 \\rceil$ medians are collected into a new, contiguous buffer. For simplicity in the analysis of large $N$, we approximate $\\lceil N/5 \\rceil$ by $N/5$. Writing these medians to a new buffer constitutes a sequential pass over the $N/5$ medians, incurring $(N/5)/B$ I/O transfers.\n    c. The algorithm recursively calls itself to find the median of these $N/5$ medians. Let this recursive call's cost be $T(N/5)$. The resulting key is the pivot for the current level.\n\n2.  **Partitioning**:\n    a. The original array of $N$ keys is partitioned around the chosen pivot. This process involves reading the $N$ keys and writing them into two separate output buffers: one for keys smaller than the pivot and one for keys larger than the pivot. This is stated to cost an aggregate of $2N/B$ transfers, which corresponds to one full read pass and one full write pass over the $N$ elements.\n\n3.  **Recursive Subproblem**:\n    a. After partitioning, the algorithm determines which of the two partitions contains the overall median. The problem states that due to the median-of-medians guarantee, the size of this subsequent recursive subproblem is at most $7N/10$. The algorithm is then called recursively on this partition. The cost for this step is at most $T(7N/10)$.\n\nCombining these costs, the total number of block transfers $T(N)$ for a problem of size $N$ is bounded by the sum of the costs of the linear scans and the recursive calls. The cost of linear scans at the current level is the sum of the costs from steps $1a$, $1b$, and $2a$:\n$$ \\text{Linear Scan Cost} = \\frac{N}{B} + \\frac{N/5}{B} + \\frac{2N}{B} = \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{5} + 2\\right)\\frac{N}{B} = \\frac{16}{5}\\frac{N}{B} $$\nTherefore, the recurrence relation for $T(N)$ is:\n$$ T(N) \\le T\\left(\\frac{N}{5}\\right) + T\\left(\\frac{7N}{10}\\right) + \\frac{16}{5}\\frac{N}{B} $$\nThe base case for this recurrence occurs when the problem size $N$ is small enough to fit within a constant number of memory blocks, i.e., $N \\le B$. In this case, the number of I/Os is constant, $T(N) = O(1)$. We are seeking an asymptotic upper bound for large $N$.\n\nWe can solve this linear recurrence by observing that the sum of the fractional sizes of the subproblems is $\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{2}{10} + \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{9}{10} < 1$. This indicates that the work done at each level of recursion decreases geometrically, and the total work is dominated by the work at the top level. The overall complexity should be linear in the scan cost, i.e., $T(N) = O(N/B)$.\n\nTo find the constant factor, we can posit a solution of the form $T(N) \\le k \\frac{N}{B}$ for some constant $k$ and solve for $k$ using substitution.\n$$ k\\frac{N}{B} \\ge T\\left(\\frac{N}{5}\\right) + T\\left(\\frac{7N}{10}\\right) + \\frac{16}{5}\\frac{N}{B} $$\nAssuming the bound holds for the smaller inputs:\n$$ k\\frac{N}{B} \\ge k\\frac{N/5}{B} + k\\frac{7N/10}{B} + \\frac{16}{5}\\frac{N}{B} $$\nFor $N>0$ and $B>0$, we can divide the inequality by $N/B$:\n$$ k \\ge k\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) + k\\left(\\frac{7}{10}\\right) + \\frac{16}{5} $$\n$$ k \\ge k\\left(\\frac{2}{10} + \\frac{7}{10}\\right) + \\frac{16}{5} $$\n$$ k \\ge k\\left(\\frac{9}{10}\\right) + \\frac{16}{5} $$\n$$ k - \\frac{9}{10}k \\ge \\frac{16}{5} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{10}k \\ge \\frac{16}{5} $$\n$$ k \\ge 10 \\cdot \\frac{16}{5} $$\n$$ k \\ge 32 $$\nChoosing the smallest valid integer constant, $k=32$, we get the upper bound $T(N) \\le 32 \\frac{N}{B}$. This demonstrates that the total number of I/O transfers is linear in the number of blocks required to store the data, which is optimal for a problem that must read all its input.\n\nAlternatively, we can sum the work done across all levels of the recursion tree. The total work is the sum of a geometric series:\n$$ T(N) \\le \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{9}{10}\\right)^i \\left(\\frac{16}{5}\\frac{N}{B}\\right) = \\frac{16}{5}\\frac{N}{B} \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{9}{10}\\right)^i $$\nThe sum of the infinite geometric series is $\\frac{1}{1 - 9/10} = 10$.\n$$ T(N) \\le \\frac{16}{5}\\frac{N}{B} \\cdot 10 = 32\\frac{N}{B} $$\nThis confirms our result.\n\nA brief discussion on why naive recursion patterns could fail: The I/O efficiency of this algorithm hinges on its cache-oblivious design, which relies on two key principles. First, the divide-and-conquer approach creates subproblems that eventually become small enough to fit in cache, irrespective of the cache size $M$. Second, all operations on large data sets are structured as sequential scans. A naive recursive algorithm might fail on this second point. For instance, if the recursive calls for the $N/5$ medians and the $7N/10$ partition were to operate on non-contiguous memory locations within a single large array, the memory access pattern would be non-sequential, leading to a high number of cache misses and block transfers. The specified algorithm avoids this by explicitly writing subproblems into new, contiguous buffers, ensuring that each recursive stage processes its data sequentially. Furthermore, recursing on only one partition (the one containing the median) is critical. A naive algorithm that recurses on both partitions, as in a sorting algorithm, would result in a much higher I/O complexity of $O\\left(\\frac{N}{B}\\log_{M/B}\\frac{N}{B}\\right)$, failing to achieve the optimal linear bound for selection.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{32 \\frac{N}{B}}\n$$", "id": "3220337"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice advances from single-run algorithms to the design of persistent, cache-oblivious data structures.

A single \"top\" subtree of height $h_{top} = \\lceil h/2 \\rceil$.\n2.  $2^{\\lceil h/2 \\rceil}$ \"bottom\" subtrees, each of height $h_{bot} = \\lfloor h/2 \\rfloor$.\n\nIn memory, the top subtree is stored contiguously, followed by all the bottom subtrees, each of which is laid out recursively. A query path from a leaf to the root traverses a path of length $h_{bot}$ in one of the bottom subtrees and then a path of length $h_{top}$ in the top subtree. Since the top subtree and the chosen bottom subtree are stored in different, non-contiguous memory regions, the path traversal naturally decomposes into two subproblems corresponding to these two structures.\n\n### Step 3: Recurrence Relation for Block Transfers\nThe total number of block transfers, $W(h)$, is the sum of the block transfers incurred while traversing the path in the bottom subtree and the top subtree. This leads to the following recurrence relation:\n$$W(h) = W(\\lfloor h/2 \\rfloor) + W(\\lceil h/2 \\rceil)$$\nThis recurrence holds as long as the subtrees involved are large enough to be recursively decomposed.\n\n### Step 4: Base Case of the Recurrence\nThe recursion terminates when the subtree becomes small enough. The problem provides a critical property of the vEB layout: \"any subtree of size at most $\\Theta(B)$ occupies $\\Theta(1)$ contiguous blocks\".\n\nA complete binary tree of height $h_{base}$ has a total of $2^{h_{base}+1}-1$ nodes, which is $\\Theta(2^{h_{base}})$ in size. The condition for the base case is when the size of the subtree is on the order of the block size $B$:\n$$\\Theta(2^{h_{base}}) = \\Theta(B)$$\nTaking the logarithm of both sides, we find the height of the base-case subtree:\n$$h_{base} = \\log_2(B) + \\mathcal{O}(1)$$\nFor a subtree of height $h \\le h_{base}$, the entire subtree is stored in $\\Theta(1)$ blocks. A path of length $h$ within this subtree requires at most $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ block transfers. Therefore, the base case for the recurrence is:\n$$W(h) = \\mathcal{O}(1) \\quad \\text{for } h \\le \\log_2(B)$$\n\n### Step 5: Solving the Recurrence\nWe need to solve the recurrence $W(h) = W(\\lfloor h/2 \\rfloor) + W(\\lceil h/2 \\rceil)$ with the base case $W(h_0) = C$ for $h_0 \\le \\log_2(B)$, where $C$ is a constant. For simplicity and leading-term analysis, we can analyze the recurrence for $h$ being a power of two, which does not affect the asymptotic result. Let $h$ be a power of $2$. The recurrence becomes:\n$$W(h) = 2W(h/2)$$\nWe can expand this recurrence:\n$$W(h) = 2W(h/2) = 2(2W(h/4)) = 4W(h/4) = \\dots = 2^k W(h/2^k)$$\nThe recursion stops after $k$ steps when the argument of $W$ reaches the base-case height, $\\log_2(B)$.\n$$ \\frac{h}{2^k} \\approx \\log_2(B) $$\nSolving for the factor $2^k$:\n$$ 2^k \\approx \\frac{h}{\\log_2(B)} $$\nNow, we substitute this back into the expanded recurrence equation. The value of $W$ at the base case, $W(\\log_2(B))$, is a constant $\\mathcal{O}(1)$.\n$$ W(h) \\approx 2^k \\cdot W(\\log_2(B)) \\approx \\frac{h}{\\log_2(B)} \\cdot \\mathcal{O}(1) $$\nThe problem asks for a tight, leading-term expression, dropping all constant multiplicative factors. Therefore, the number of block transfers is:\n$$ W(h) \\approx \\frac{h}{\\log_2(B)} $$\n\n### Step 6: Final Expression\nThe height of the tree $h$ is related to the number of elements $n$ by $h = \\log_2(n)$. Substituting this into our expression for $W(h)$:\n$$ W(n, B) \\approx \\frac{\\log_2(n)}{\\log_2(B)} $$\nUsing the change of base formula for logarithms, $\\log_b(a) = \\frac{\\log_c(a)}{\\log_c(b)}$, we can write this as:\n$$ W(n, B) \\approx \\log_B(n) $$\nFinally, the problem requires the answer to be expressed using natural logarithms ($\\ln$). We apply the change of base formula again:\n$$ \\log_B(n) = \\frac{\\ln(n)}{\\ln(B)} $$\nThis is the required tight, leading-term expression for the worst-case number of block transfers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\ln(n)}{\\ln(B)}}$$", "id": "3220363"}]}
