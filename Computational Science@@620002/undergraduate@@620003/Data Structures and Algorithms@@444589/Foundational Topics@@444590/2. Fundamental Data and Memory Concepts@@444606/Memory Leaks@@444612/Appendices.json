{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To begin our hands-on exploration, we first need a solid model for what a memory leak is and how to measure it. This initial practice establishes a clear framework by simulating a common scenario: a global registry that tracks objects but fails to clean up entries for objects that have been destroyed. By working through this exercise [@problem_id:3252070], you will learn to distinguish between two fundamental types of leaks—unfreed objects and stale data structure entries—and to quantify their impact precisely.", "problem": "You are given a simplified, language-agnostic model of manual memory management designed to capture a common data structure leak pattern: a class constructor registers each newly constructed object’s address in a global static map, but the class destructor does not remove the entry. In this model, each successful construction (allocation) inserts an entry into a global static registry, and each successful destruction frees the object’s memory but leaves behind a stale registry entry. Your task is to implement an algorithm that, for several event sequences, computes three quantities per sequence: the number of bytes still allocated for objects that were never destroyed, the number of bytes leaked by stale global map entries corresponding to objects that were destroyed, and the total of these two quantities.\n\nFundamental base and definitions:\n- Manual heap allocation and deallocation follow the well-tested rule that an allocation increments reserved memory and a deallocation decrements it. A memory leak is defined as allocated memory that remains unfreed when the program terminates. In this problem, we formalize two kinds of leaks:\n  1) Object leak: Objects that were allocated but never destroyed by the end of the sequence.\n  2) Data structure leak: Stale entries left in a global static registry that were supposed to be removed by a destructor but were not.\n- Let $m$ be the fixed overhead in bytes per registry entry. In this problem, $m = 64$.\n- Each event is one of:\n  - ALLOC$(\\text{id}, s)$: allocate a new object with identifier $\\text{id}$ and size $s$ bytes. This is only valid if $\\text{id}$ is not currently alive. On success, the global registry stores one entry for this allocation and the object becomes alive with size $s$.\n  - DELETE$(\\text{id})$: destroy the alive object $\\text{id}$ if it is alive. On success, the object’s $s$ bytes are freed, but the stale registry entry remains because the destructor does not remove it. If $\\text{id}$ is not alive, DELETE has no effect.\n- Let $\\text{Alive}$ be the set of currently alive objects. Let $s(x)$ denote the size in bytes for alive object $x \\in \\text{Alive}$. Let $N_{\\text{stale}}$ be the number of successful DELETE operations in the event sequence (each corresponds to exactly one stale global map entry in this model).\n- The required outputs per sequence are:\n  - Object-leak bytes: $L_{\\text{obj}} = \\sum_{x \\in \\text{Alive}} s(x)$.\n  - Data-structure-leak bytes: $L_{\\text{map}} = m \\cdot N_{\\text{stale}}$.\n  - Total leaked bytes: $L_{\\text{tot}} = L_{\\text{obj}} + L_{\\text{map}}$.\n- All outputs are to be expressed as plain integers representing bytes.\n\nInput and event semantics for testing:\n- You will not read input. Instead, implement your program to evaluate the following six test sequences. Each sequence is a list of events, where ALLOC$(\\text{id}, s)$ has identifier $\\text{id}$ and size $s$ bytes, and DELETE$(\\text{id})$ has only identifier $\\text{id}$.\n- The fixed registry-entry cost is $m = 64$ in all cases.\n\nTest suite:\n1) Happy path with mixed allocations and deletions:\n   - Events: ALLOC$(A, 100)$, ALLOC$(B, 200)$, DELETE$(A)$, ALLOC$(C, 50)$, DELETE$(C)$.\n2) Boundary: empty sequence (no events).\n3) Reuse of identifiers after deletion:\n   - Events: ALLOC$(X, 10)$, DELETE$(X)$, ALLOC$(X, 10)$.\n4) Only allocations, no deletions:\n   - Events: ALLOC$(A, 1)$, ALLOC$(B, 2)$, ALLOC$(C, 3)$.\n5) Multiple deletes and re-allocations stressing stale-entry accumulation:\n   - Events: ALLOC$(D, 70)$, DELETE$(D)$, DELETE$(D)$, ALLOC$(E, 30)$, DELETE$(E)$, ALLOC$(E, 40)$, DELETE$(E)$.\n6) Boundary: delete of a never-allocated identifier:\n   - Events: DELETE$(Z)$.\n\nAlgorithmic requirements:\n- Maintain a mapping of alive identifiers to their sizes. On ALLOC$(\\text{id}, s)$, insert if and only if $\\text{id}$ is not already alive. On DELETE$(\\text{id})$, if $\\text{id}$ is alive, remove it and increment $N_{\\text{stale}}$ by $1$; otherwise, do nothing. At the end of the sequence, compute $L_{\\text{obj}}$, $L_{\\text{map}}$, and $L_{\\text{tot}}$ using the formulas above.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element is itself a three-integer list $[L_{\\text{obj}}, L_{\\text{map}}, L_{\\text{tot}}]$ for each test sequence in order. For example: \"[[a,b,c],[d,e,f],...]\" with all values as integers in bytes.", "solution": "The problem statement is validated as sound. It presents a clear, self-contained, and logically consistent model for analyzing two specific types of memory leaks in a simplified system. The definitions, event semantics, and required calculations are unambiguous and well-posed, allowing for a unique and verifiable solution. The model is a valid abstraction of real-world memory management issues in computer science, specifically within data structures and algorithms, and contains no scientific or factual flaws.\n\nThe core of the problem is to track the state of a system through a sequence of discrete events. The state is defined by two components: the set of currently allocated, or \"alive,\" objects, and a count of stale registry entries created by object destructions. The algorithm will process each event in a given sequence, updating the state accordingly, and then compute the final leak metrics based on the terminal state.\n\n### Algorithmic Design and State Management\n\nFor each test sequence, the system's state is managed using two primary variables:\n1.  A hash map, which we will denote as `alive_objects`, to store the identifiers and sizes of all currently alive objects. The key is the object identifier ($\\text{id}$) and the value is its size ($s$). This data structure provides average-time complexity of $O(1)$ for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations, which is optimal for this task.\n2.  An integer counter, $N_{\\text{stale}}$, initialized to $0$, to track the number of successful `DELETE` operations. Each such operation corresponds to one stale entry in the global registry.\n\nThe fixed overhead per registry entry is given as a constant, $m = 64$ bytes.\n\n### Event Processing Logic\n\nThe algorithm iterates through each event in a sequence, applying the following rules:\n\n1.  **For an `ALLOC$(\\text{id}, s)$` event:** The algorithm first checks if the identifier $\\text{id}$ exists as a key in the `alive_objects` map.\n    - If $\\text{id}$ is **not** present, the allocation is successful. A new entry is added to the map: `alive_objects[id] = s`.\n    - If $\\text{id}$ is already present, the event is invalid as per the problem description (\"only valid if $\\text{id}$ is not currently alive\"), and no change is made to the state.\n\n2.  **For a `DELETE$(\\text{id})$` event:** The algorithm checks if the identifier $\\text{id}$ exists in the `alive_objects` map.\n    - If $\\text{id}$ is present, the deletion is successful. The object is no longer alive, so its entry is removed from the `alive_objects` map. Concurrently, since the faulty destructor leaves a stale entry in the global registry, the counter $N_{\\text{stale}}$ is incremented by $1$.\n    - If $\\text{id}$ is not present, the object is not alive, and the `DELETE` operation has no effect.\n\n### Final Calculation of Memory Leaks\n\nAfter all events in a sequence have been processed, the three required quantities are calculated from the final state of `alive_objects` and $N_{\\text{stale}}$:\n\n1.  **Object-Leak Bytes ($L_{\\text{obj}}$):** This is the memory consumed by objects that were allocated but never destroyed. It is the sum of the sizes of all objects remaining in the `alive_objects` map.\n    $$L_{\\text{obj}} = \\sum_{x \\in \\text{Alive}} s(x) = \\sum_{s_i \\in \\text{values(alive\\_objects)}} s_i$$\n    If `alive_objects` is empty, $L_{\\text{obj}} = 0$.\n\n2.  **Data-Structure-Leak Bytes ($L_{\\text{map}}$):** This is the memory consumed by stale entries in the global registry. Each successful deletion contributes one stale entry of size $m$.\n    $$L_{\\text{map}} = m \\cdot N_{\\text{stale}} = 64 \\cdot N_{\\text{stale}}$$\n\n3.  **Total Leaked Bytes ($L_{\\text{tot}}$):** This is the sum of the two leak types.\n    $$L_{\\text{tot}} = L_{\\text{obj}} + L_{\\text{map}}$$\n\n### Example Trace (Test Case 1)\n\nLet's trace the algorithm with the first test sequence: `ALLOC$(A, 100)$, ALLOC$(B, 200)$, DELETE$(A)$, ALLOC$(C, 50)$, DELETE$(C)$.\n- **Initial state:** `alive_objects` $= \\{\\}$, $N_{\\text{stale}} = 0$.\n- **Event 1: `ALLOC$(A, 100)$`**: `A` is not in `alive_objects`. State becomes: `alive_objects` $= \\{'A': 100\\}$, $N_{\\text{stale}} = 0$.\n- **Event 2: `ALLOC$(B, 200)$`**: `B` is not in `alive_objects`. State becomes: `alive_objects` $= \\{'A': 100, 'B': 200\\}$, $N_{\\text{stale}} = 0$.\n- **Event 3: `DELETE$(A)$`**: `A` is in `alive_objects`. Entry for `A` is removed and $N_{\\text{stale}}$ is incremented. State becomes: `alive_objects` $= \\{'B': 200\\}$, $N_{\\text{stale}} = 1$.\n- **Event 4: `ALLOC$(C, 50)$`**: `C` is not in `alive_objects`. State becomes: `alive_objects` $= \\{'B': 200, 'C': 50\\}$, $N_{\\text{stale}} = 1$.\n- **Event 5: `DELETE$(C)$`**: `C` is in `alive_objects`. Entry for `C` is removed and $N_{\\text{stale}}$ is incremented. State becomes: `alive_objects` $= \\{'B': 200\\}$, $N_{\\text{stale}} = 2$.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n- $L_{\\text{obj}} = s('B') = 200$ bytes.\n- $L_{\\text{map}} = 64 \\cdot N_{\\text{stale}} = 64 \\cdot 2 = 128$ bytes.\n- $L_{\\text{tot}} = 200 + 128 = 328$ bytes.\nThe result for this sequence is $[200, 128, 328]$.

You will see how a seemingly minor flaw in implementing an object's lifecycle rules can lead to significant memory leaks, reinforcing the importance of careful design in object-oriented programming.", "problem": "You are asked to formalize and analyze a controlled memory-leak scenario that arises from a flawed copy assignment operator in a custom smart pointer used inside a standard vector. Your task is to write a complete, runnable program that deterministically simulates the following semantics and produces the specified outputs for a fixed test suite.\n\nConsider a hypothetical custom smart pointer type that manages a heap allocation via a control block with a reference count. The vector stores these smart pointers as elements. The following fundamental base definitions apply:\n\n- A memory leak is the condition where a dynamically allocated block remains unfreed (logically unreachable by the program) at the end of execution.\n- A correct copy assignment for reference-counted ownership should, when assigning from a source element to a destination element, first decrement the destination’s current block reference count and delete the block if the count reaches zero, then increment the source’s block reference count, and finally make the destination point to the same block as the source.\n- A copy construction should only increment the source’s block reference count and point to the same block; it does not delete anything.\n- Destruction of an element should decrement its block reference count and delete the block if the count reaches zero.\n\nIn this exercise, you will simulate a single, specific flaw in the copy assignment operator that is triggered by a particular within-vector assignment direction. The flaw is:\n\n- Let the vector be denoted by $v$, with elements indexed by $0,1,2,\\dots$. When executing $v[i] \\leftarrow v[j]$ (copy assignment), if $j < i$ at the time of assignment (that is, the source element index is strictly less than the destination element index in the same vector), then the flawed operator:\n  - increments the reference count of the source block,\n  - sets $v[i]$ to point to the source block,\n  - but entirely omits decrementing the previous block held by $v[i]$.\n  This omission causes a leak of one logical \"release\" on the previous block, and thus can result in a heap block that is never deleted by the time all elements are destroyed.\n- If $j > i$, the operator behaves correctly: it decrements the destination’s previous block, deleting if the count reaches zero, then increments the source block and updates the destination pointer.\n- If $j = i$, the operator is a no-op (self-assignment).\n- Copy construction always increments the source’s reference count and does not delete anything.\n- Destruction always decrements the held block and deletes it if the count reaches zero.\n- A \"block deletion\" is modeled as occurring exactly when the reference count of that block transitions to zero due to a correct decrement in either a correct assignment or destruction. If, due to the flaw, a decrement is skipped, the block’s count remains artificially high and the block will remain allocated at program end, contributing to the leak count.\n\nYou will write a program that simulates these rules at the level of reference counts and vector indices. You do not need to actually manage memory; instead, your program must count how many allocated blocks remain not deleted (that is, have strictly positive reference counts) after the vector is destroyed at the end of each test case. Each push operation allocates a fresh new block with reference count initially $1$. All copy assignments $v[i] \\leftarrow v[j]$ alias $v[i]$ to the same block as $v[j]$ under the above flawed operator semantics.\n\nYour program should hard-code and execute the following test suite. The vector starts empty in each test case. Operations are written as push$(x)$ for any concrete integer $x$ (the actual numeric value is irrelevant to the allocation identity) and assign$(i,j)$ meaning the copy assignment $v[i] \\leftarrow v[j]$ evaluated under the above rules.\n\nTest Case $1$ (happy path showing leaks due to left-to-right assignments):\n- push$(10)$, push$(20)$, push$(30)$, push$(40)$\n- assign$(1,0)$, assign$(2,1)$, assign$(3,2)$\n\nTest Case $2$ (reverse-direction assignments, no leaks):\n- push$(10)$, push$(20)$, push$(30)$, push$(40)$\n- assign$(2,3)$, assign$(1,2)$, assign$(0,1)$\n\nTest Case $3$ (mixture with repeated aliasing):\n- push$(1)$, push$(2)$, push$(3)$\n- assign$(1,0)$, assign$(1,0)$, assign$(2,1)$\n\nTest Case $4$ (includes self-assignment and a single leak):\n- push$(5)$, push$(6)$, push$(7)$\n- assign$(0,0)$, assign$(2,1)$, assign$(2,0)$\n\nTest Case $5$ (boundary: single element, self-assignment only):\n- push$(42)$\n- assign$(0,0)$\n\nFor each test case, after performing all operations, simulate destroying the vector by destructing its elements in any order (the order does not change the final leak count under the above rules). A block is considered leaked if and only if its reference count is strictly positive after all destructors have run. Your program must compute, for each test case, the total number of leaked blocks and aggregate the results in a single line of output.\n\nRequired final output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line containing the results for Test Cases $1$ through $5$ as a comma-separated list of integers enclosed in square brackets, for example, [result_1,result_2,result_3,result_4,result_5].", "solution": "The user-provided problem has been validated and is determined to be a valid and well-posed problem in the domain of computer science, specifically focusing on memory management, data structures, and algorithms. It provides a clear, self-contained, and logically consistent set of rules for simulating a memory leak scenario caused by a flawed copy assignment operator.\n\nThe problem asks for a deterministic simulation of reference-counted memory management. A custom smart pointer type, when stored in a vector, exhibits a flaw in its copy assignment operator. Our task is to model this system, execute a series of defined operations, and calculate the number of memory blocks that are \"leaked\" (i.e., have a positive reference count after all program objects are destroyed).\n\nTo formalize a solution, we will construct a model of the system's state and define how this state evolves according to the specified operations.\n\n**State Representation**\n\nThe state of the system at any point in time can be fully described by two components:\n$1$. A vector, denoted by $v$. The elements of this vector, $v[i]$, do not store data directly but instead hold identifiers for dynamically allocated memory blocks. Let $v_i$ be the block identifier at index $i$.\n$2$. A data structure to maintain the reference count for each memory block. We can model this as an array or map, $C$, where $C_b$ is the reference count of the block with identifier $b$.\n\nBlock identifiers are unique integers starting from $0$. A new block is allocated for each `push` operation.\n\n**Simulation of Operations**\n\nThe simulation proceeds by executing a sequence of operations that modify the state $(v, C)$.\n\n**1. `push` Operation**\nA `push(x)` operation simulates the allocation of a new memory block and adding a smart pointer to it to the end of the vector.\n- A new, unique block identifier $b_{new}$ is generated.\n- The reference count for this new block is initialized to $1$: $C_{b_{new}} \\leftarrow 1$.\n- The vector $v$ is extended with this new block identifier.\n\n**2. `assign(i, j)` Operation**\nThis operation models the copy assignment $v[i] \\leftarrow v[j]$. The behavior depends on the relationship between the indices $i$ and $j$.\n- Let $b_{src} = v_j$ be the identifier of the block pointed to by the source element.\n- Let $b_{dest\\_old} = v_i$ be the identifier of the block currently pointed to by the destination element.\n\nThe rules are as follows:\n- **Case $j = i$ (Self-Assignment):** The operation is a no-op, and the state $(v, C)$ remains unchanged.\n- **Case $j > i$ (Correct Assignment):** The assignment operator behaves correctly.\n    $1$. The reference count of the block previously held by the destination is decremented: $C_{b_{dest\\_old}} \\leftarrow C_{b_{dest\\_old}} - 1$. If this count becomes $0$, the block is considered deallocated.\n    $2$. The reference count of the source block is incremented: $C_{b_{src}} \\leftarrow C_{b_{src}} + 1$.\n    $3$. The destination element $v_i$ is updated to point to the source block: $v_i \\leftarrow b_{src}$.\n- **Case $j < i$ (Flawed Assignment):** The operator's flaw is triggered.\n    $1$. The reference count of the source block is incremented: $C_{b_{src}} \\leftarrow C_{b_{src}} + 1$.\n    $2$. The destination element $v_i$ is updated to point to the source block: $v_i \\leftarrow b_{src}$.\n    $3$. Critically, the decrement on $C_{b_{dest\\_old}}$ is **omitted**. This is the source of the memory leak. The reference count of the block originally at $v_i$ remains artificially high, potentially preventing its deallocation.\n\n**Finalization and Leak Detection**\n\nAfter all specified `push` and `assign` operations for a test case are completed, we simulate the destruction of the vector $v$. This involves calling the destructor for each smart pointer element within it.\n- For each element $v_k$ in the final state of the vector, its destructor decrements the reference count of the block it points to: $C_{v_k} \\leftarrow C_{v_k} - 1$.\n\nAfter this destruction phase, a memory block $b$ is considered \"leaked\" if and only if its reference count is strictly positive, i.e., $C_b > 0$. The total number of leaked blocks for a test case is the cardinality of the set of all such blocks:\n$$ \\text{Total Leaks} = \\left| \\{ b \\mid C_b > 0 \\} \\right| $$\n\n**Example Walkthrough: Test Case 1**\n- Operations: `push(10)`, `push(20)`, `push(30)`, `push(40)`; `assign(1,0)`, `assign(2,1)`, `assign(3,2)`.\n- **After pushes**:\n    - $v = [0, 1, 2, 3]$\n    - $C = \\{C_0: 1, C_1: 1, C_2: 1, C_3: 1\\}$\n- **`assign(1,0)`**: $j=0 < i=1$ (flawed).\n    - $b_{src}=0$, $b_{dest\\_old}=1$.\n    - $C_0 \\leftarrow C_0 + 1 = 2$.\n    - $v_1 \\leftarrow 0$.\n    - $C_1$ is not decremented.\n    - State: $v = [0, 0, 2, 3]$, $C=\\{C_0: 2, C_1: 1, C_2: 1, C_3: 1\\}$.

Our final practice moves from analysis to diagnostics, challenging you to implement the core logic of a memory profiler. By processing a log of allocations and their corresponding call stacks, you will develop an algorithm to pinpoint the most probable origin of a leak [@problem_id:3252039]. This exercise provides a powerful glimpse into the automated tools and techniques that software engineers use to maintain the health and efficiency of complex systems.", "problem": "You are given a formal model of manual memory management and call stacks in a program. An allocation event records an object identifier, a number of bytes, and a call stack signature, represented as a finite sequence of integer-encoded function identifiers. A deallocation event records an object identifier. The program terminates at a final time. A memory leak is any allocation that has not been paired with a corresponding deallocation by the final time. The goal is to design and implement an algorithm that profiles the origin of leaked memory, defined as the call stack prefix whose descendants collectively account for the largest amount of leaked bytes, in order to pinpoint where the leak most likely originates.\n\nStart from the following fundamental base:\n- Manual memory management uses allocation and deallocation operations. An allocation reserves memory for an object and records metadata. A deallocation releases the reservation. Any allocation not followed by a deallocation before termination is considered leaked.\n- A call stack at the moment of allocation is a finite sequence (top frame first) of function identifiers that are integer-encoded. The sequence represents the path of control that led to the allocation.\n- Aggregation over prefixes of sequences is a standard approach to attributing responsibility in hierarchical data: a prefix accumulates quantities from all sequences that begin with that prefix.\n\nDefinitions and requirements:\n- Let the event log be a finite sequence $E$ of events. An allocation event is a tuple $(\\text{alloc}, o, b, s)$ where $o$ is an object identifier, $b$ is the number of bytes, and $s = \\langle f_1, f_2, \\dots, f_m \\rangle$ is the call stack signature with $m \\ge 1$, each $f_i$ an integer. A deallocation event is $(\\text{free}, o)$.\n- Let $T$ denote program termination. Define the set of leaked allocations $L$ to be all allocations $(o,b,s)$ in $E$ such that there is no corresponding deallocation $(\\text{free}, o)$ appearing after that allocation and before $T$.\n- For any non-empty prefix $p = \\langle f_1, \\dots, f_k \\rangle$ with $1 \\le k \\le m$, define the aggregated leaked bytes attributed to $p$ by\n$$\nB(p) \\;=\\; \\sum_{(o,b,s) \\in L \\;:\\; s \\text{ begins with } p} \\; b.\n$$\n- Define the pinpoint origin $p^\\star$ to be any non-empty prefix that maximizes $B(p)$. In case of ties, choose the one with the smallest length $k$. If a tie still remains, choose the lexicographically smallest sequence (standard lexicographic order on integer sequences).\n- If $L$ is empty, define the pinpoint origin to be the empty list.\n\nYour task is to:\n- Implement a program that, given a fixed test suite of event logs, computes the pinpoint origin $p^\\star$ for each test case according to the above definition.\n\nConstraints and assumptions:\n- Object identifiers are unique for concurrently live allocations. Each $(\\text{free}, o)$ matches the most recent unmatched $(\\text{alloc}, o, b, s)$ in $E$ if present. Event sequences are well-formed and do not contain duplicate allocations of the same $o$ without an intervening $(\\text{free}, o)$.\n- Call stacks are non-empty finite sequences of integers.\n\nTest suite:\n- Test case $1$:\n  - Events: $(\\text{alloc}, 1, 100, \\langle 10, 20, 30 \\rangle)$, $(\\text{alloc}, 2, 200, \\langle 10, 21 \\rangle)$, $(\\text{free}, 1)$, $(\\text{alloc}, 3, 300, \\langle 11, 20 \\rangle)$, then $T$.\n- Test case $2$:\n  - Events: $(\\text{alloc}, 1, 50, \\langle 1 \\rangle)$, $(\\text{free}, 1)$, then $T$.\n- Test case $3$:\n  - Events: $(\\text{alloc}, 1, 100, \\langle 5, 1 \\rangle)$, $(\\text{alloc}, 2, 100, \\langle 5, 1, 2 \\rangle)$, then $T$.\n- Test case $4$:\n  - Events: $(\\text{alloc}, 1, 150, \\langle 7, 10 \\rangle)$, $(\\text{alloc}, 2, 150, \\langle 7, 11 \\rangle)$, $(\\text{alloc}, 3, 300, \\langle 8, 9 \\rangle)$, then $T$.\n\nRequired final output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the pinpoint origins for the four test cases, as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each origin is itself rendered as a list of integers (and the empty origin as an empty list), for example, [[], [1], [2,3]]. Concretely for this problem, the program must output the computed origins for the four provided test cases in this single-line format.", "solution": "The problem statement has been analyzed and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of computer science, specifically memory profiling and algorithmic analysis. The problem is well-posed, providing a formal, objective, and self-contained set of definitions and constraints that uniquely determine a solution for any given input. It is free from logical contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies.\n\nThe task is to identify the \"pinpoint origin\" $p^\\star$ of memory leaks from a log of allocation and deallocation events. An allocation event is given by $(\\text{alloc}, o, b, s)$, where $o$ is an object identifier, $b$ is the number of bytes allocated, and $s = \\langle f_1, f_2, \\dots, f_m \\rangle$ is the call stack signature. A deallocation event is $(\\text{free}, o)$. A memory leak occurs if an allocation for an object $o$ is not matched by a subsequent deallocation before program termination $T$. The pinpoint origin $p^\\star$ is the non-empty call stack prefix that is associated with the maximum total bytes of leaked memory, with specific tie-breaking rules.\n\nThe solution is systematically constructed in three stages:\n1.  **Identification of Leaked Allocations**: First, we must identify the set $L$ of all leaked allocations. This is achieved by processing the event log chronologically. A hash map (dictionary) is used to track currently active allocations, mapping each object identifier $o$ to its allocation details $(b, s)$.\n    -   Upon encountering an allocation event $(\\text{alloc}, o, b, s)$, an entry for $o$ is added to the map.\n    -   Upon encountering a deallocation event $(\\text{free}, o)$, the corresponding entry for $o$ is removed from the map, signifying that the memory has been freed.\n    -   After processing all events up to termination $T$, any remaining entries in the map correspond to leaked allocations. The set $L$ consists of the tuples $(o, b, s)$ for these remaining entries.\n\n2.  **Aggregation of Leaked Bytes over Call Stack Prefixes**: With the set $L$ of leaked allocations identified, the next step is to compute the aggregated leaked bytes $B(p)$ for every non-empty prefix $p$ of every call stack $s$ in $L$. The quantity $B(p)$ is defined as:\n    $$\n    B(p) \\;=\\; \\sum_{(o,b,s) \\in L \\;:\\; s \\text{ begins with } p} \\; b.\n    $$\n    This aggregation can be efficiently performed using a hash map where keys are tuples representing the prefixes and values are the accumulated byte counts. For each leaked allocation $(o, b, s)$, we iterate through all its non-empty prefixes $p_k = \\langle f_1, \\dots, f_k \\rangle$ for $k=1, \\dots, m$. For each such prefix $p_k$, we add the byte count $b$ to the corresponding entry in our aggregation map.\n\n3.  **Determination of the Pinpoint Origin ($p^\\star$)**: The final stage is to find the pinpoint origin $p^\\star$ from the computed prefix aggregations. The problem defines $p^\\star$ as the prefix that maximizes $B(p)$, with the following tie-breaking rules in order of precedence:\n    1.  Maximum value of $B(p)$.\n    2.  Minimum prefix length.\n    3.  Lexicographically smallest prefix sequence.\n\n    If the set of leaks $L$ is empty, $p^\\star$ is defined as the empty list. Otherwise, we can construct a list of candidate tuples $(B(p), \\text{length}(p), p)$ for every prefix $p$ in our aggregation map. By sorting this list, we can systematically apply the selection criteria. The primary sort key is $B(p)$ in descending order. The secondary key is $\\text{length}(p)$ in ascending order. The tertiary key is the prefix $p$ itself, sorted in standard lexicographical ascending order. The prefix from the first element of the sorted list is the desired pinpoint origin $p^\\star$.\n\nThis principled approach guarantees the correct identification of $p^\\star$ according to the problem's formal definition.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the pinpoint memory leak origin for a suite of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each event is a tuple.
