A twice-differentiable function is convex on a convex set if and only if its Hessian matrix is positive semidefinite over that set. The domain $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a convex set. The function is $f(x,y) = x^2$. Its gradient vector is:\n$$\n\\nabla f(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe Hessian matrix is the matrix of second-order partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 f(x,y) = H = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}  \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe Hessian matrix is constant for all $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. To check for positive semidefiniteness, we examine the quadratic form $v^{\\mathsf{T}}Hv$ for an arbitrary vector $v = \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n$$\nv^{\\mathsf{T}}Hv = \\begin{pmatrix} v_1  v_2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2v_1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix} = 2v_1^2\n$$\nSince $v_1^2 \\ge 0$, we have $v^{\\mathsf{T}}Hv = 2v_1^2 \\ge 0$ for all $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. Therefore, the Hessian matrix is positive semidefinite, and the function $f(x,y)=x^2$ is convex on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nNext, we assess the strong convexity of $f$. A differentiable function $f$ is strongly convex on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ if there exists a constant $m  0$ such that for all $z_1, z_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, the following inequality holds:\n$$\nf(z_2) \\ge f(z_1) + \\nabla f(z_1)^{\\mathsf{T}}(z_2 - z_1) + \\frac{m}{2} \\|z_2 - z_1\\|_2^2\n$$\nLet $z_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $z_2 = (x_2, y_2)$. Substituting the expressions for $f$ and its gradient:\n$$\nx_2^2 \\ge x_1^2 + \\begin{pmatrix} 2x_1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_2-x_1 \\\\ y_2-y_1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\frac{m}{2} \\left( (x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2 \\right)\n$$\n$$\nx_2^2 \\ge x_1^2 + 2x_1(x_2-x_1) + \\frac{m}{2} \\left( \\|z_2 - z_1\\|_2^2 \\right)\n$$\n$$\nx_2^2 \\ge x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 - 2x_1^2 + \\frac{m}{2} \\|z_2 - z_1\\|_2^2\n$$\n$$\nx_2^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_1^2 \\ge \\frac{m}{2} \\|z_2 - z_1\\|_2^2\n$$\n$$\n(x_2-x_1)^2 \\ge \\frac{m}{2} \\left( (x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2 \\right)\n$$\nFor $f$ to be strongly convex, this inequality must hold for some constant $m0$ and for all pairs of points $z_1, z_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. To show it is not strongly convex, we need only find a pair of points for which the inequality is violated for any $m0$. Let us choose points with the same $x$-coordinate, for instance, $x_1=x_2=0$. Let $y_1=0$ and $y_2=1$.\nSo, $z_1=(0,0)$ and $z_2=(0,1)$.\nSubstituting these values into the inequality:\n$$\n(0-0)^2 \\ge \\frac{m}{2} \\left( (0-0)^2 + (1-0)^2 \\right)\n$$\n$$\n0 \\ge \\frac{m}{2} \\left( 0 + 1 \\right)\n$$\n$$\n0 \\ge \\frac{m}{2}\n$$\nThis inequality is false for any $m0$. Since the condition for strong convexity must hold for all points in the domain, and we have found a case where it fails for any positive $m$, we conclude that $f(x,y)=x^2$ is not strongly convex on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nPart (b): Strong convexity of $f$ on the affine line $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha,\\beta}$.\n\nWe are tasked with finding the largest constant $m(\\alpha)$ such that $f$ is strongly convex with this parameter when its domain is restricted to the line $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha,\\beta}=\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2: y=\\alpha x+\\beta\\}$.\nLet $z_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $z_2 = (x_2, y_2)$ be two distinct points on the line $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha,\\beta}$. This means $y_1 = \\alpha x_1 + \\beta$ and $y_2 = \\alpha x_2 + \\beta$.\nWe use the first-order inequality for strong convexity:\n$$\nf(z_2) \\ge f(z_1) + \\nabla f(z_1)^{\\mathsf{T}}(z_2 - z_1) + \\frac{m(\\alpha)}{2} \\|z_2 - z_1\\|_2^2\n$$\nWe need to find the largest $m(\\alpha)$ for which this inequality holds for all $z_1, z_2 \\in \\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha,\\beta}$.\nLet us express each term as a function of $x_1$ and $x_2$.\nThe left-hand side is $f(z_2) = x_2^2$.\nThe terms on the right-hand side are:\n$f(z_1) = x_1^2$.\n$\\nabla f(z_1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x_1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe vector difference $z_2-z_1$ is:\n$$\nz_2 - z_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} x_2 - x_1 \\\\ y_2 - y_1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_2 - x_1 \\\\ (\\alpha x_2 + \\beta) - (\\alpha x_1 + \\beta) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_2 - x_1 \\\\ \\alpha(x_2 - x_1) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe inner product term is:\n$$\n\\nabla f(z_1)^{\\mathsf{T}}(z_2 - z_1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x_1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_2 - x_1 \\\\ \\alpha(x_2 - x_1) \\end{pmatrix} = 2x_1(x_2 - x_1)\n$$\nThe squared Euclidean norm is:\n$$\n\\|z_2 - z_1\\|_2^2 = (x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2 = (x_2-x_1)^2 + (\\alpha(x_2-x_1))^2 = (1+\\alpha^2)(x_2-x_1)^2\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions back into the strong convexity inequality:\n$$\nx_2^2 \\ge x_1^2 + 2x_1(x_2 - x_1) + \\frac{m(\\alpha)}{2} (1+\\alpha^2)(x_2-x_1)^2\n$$\nRearranging the terms to isolate the quadratic term in $(x_2-x_1)$:\n$$\nx_2^2 - (x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 - 2x_1^2) \\ge \\frac{m(\\alpha)}{2} (1+\\alpha^2)(x_2-x_1)^2\n$$\n$$\nx_2^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_1^2 \\ge \\frac{m(\\alpha)}{2} (1+\\alpha^2)(x_2-x_1)^2\n$$\n$$\n(x_2-x_1)^2 \\ge \\frac{m(\\alpha)}{2} (1+\\alpha^2)(x_2-x_1)^2\n$$\nThis inequality must hold for all $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.

The process begins with the fundamental definitions of convexity and strong convexity and justifies the method used for this specific function, which is continuously differentiable but not twice differentiable everywhere.\n\nA differentiable function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is defined as convex if its graph lies above all of its tangents. This is formally stated as:\n$$f(y) \\geq f(x) + f'(x)(y-x) \\quad \\forall x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$$\nA function $f$ is said to be strongly convex with modulus $m > 0$ if the function $g(x) = f(x) - \\frac{m}{2}x^2$ is convex. Applying the definition of convexity to $g(x)$, we find that $f$ is $m$-strongly convex if and only if:\n$$f(y) - \\frac{m}{2}y^2 \\geq \\left(f(x) - \\frac{m}{2}x^2\\right) + (f'(x) - mx)(y-x) \\quad \\forall x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$$\nRearranging this inequality gives the standard definition of strong convexity for a differentiable function:\n$$f(y) \\geq f(x) + f'(x)(y-x) + \\frac{m}{2}(y-x)^2 \\quad \\forall x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$$\nAn equivalent characterization for a differentiable function $g(x)$ to be convex is that its first derivative, $g'(x)$, must be a non-decreasing function. For strong convexity of $f$, this means the derivative of $g(x) = f(x) - \\frac{m}{2}x^2$, which is $g'(x) = f'(x) - mx$, must be non-decreasing.\n\nThe problem statement refers to the characterization for twice-differentiable functions, where $f$ is $m$-strongly convex if and only if $f''(x) \\geq m$ for all $x$. This follows directly from the non-decreasing nature of $g'(x)$: if $g'(x)$ is itself differentiable, it is non-decreasing if and only if its derivative is non-negative, i.e., $(g'(x))' = f''(x) - m \\geq 0$.\n\nThe given function $f(x)$ is continuous and, as verified in the problem statement, once differentiable on all of $\\mathbb{R}$. However, it is only piecewise twice-differentiable. Let's compute the first and second derivatives.\nThe function is:\n$$\nf(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\nx^2,  x \\leq -1 \\\\\n-2x - 1,  -1  x  1 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2}x^2 - 3x - \\frac{1}{2},  x \\geq 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe first derivative $f'(x)$ is obtained by differentiating each piece:\n$$\nf'(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n2x,  x  -1 \\\\\n-2,  -1  x  1 \\\\\nx - 3,  x  1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nAt the junction points, the left and right derivatives are:\nAt $x=-1$: $\\lim_{x \\to -1^-} f'(x) = 2(-1) = -2$ and $\\lim_{x \\to -1^+} f'(x) = -2$.\nAt $x=1$: $\\lim_{x \\to 1^-} f'(x) = -2$ and $\\lim_{x \\to 1^+} f'(x) = 1 - 3 = -2$.\nSince the limits match at the junctions, $f'(x)$ is continuous and defined for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, with $f'(-1) = -2$ and $f'(1) = -2$.\nThe second derivative $f''(x)$ exists for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ except at $x=-1$ and $x=1$:\n$$\nf''(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n2,  x  -1 \\\\\n0,  -1  x  1 \\\\\n1,  x  1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFor our function $f$, which is $C^1$ and piecewise $C^2$, the characterization via the second derivative can be adapted. The condition that $g'(x) = f'(x) - mx$ must be non-decreasing still holds. As $g'(x)$ is a continuous and piecewise differentiable function, it is non-decreasing if and only if its derivative is non-negative wherever it exists. The derivative of $g'(x)$ is $g''(x) = f''(x) - m$.\nTherefore, we require $f''(x) - m \\geq 0$, or $f''(x) \\geq m$, for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{-1, 1\\}$.\n\nThe global strong convexity modulus, $m^{\\star}$, is the supremum of all values of $m$ for which $f$ is $m$-strongly convex. To satisfy the condition $f''(x) \\geq m$ for all $x$ where $f''(x)$ is defined, $m$ must be less than or equal to every value that $f''(x)$ takes. This means $m$ must be a lower bound for the set of values of $f''(x)$. The largest such $m$ is the greatest lower bound, or the infimum, of $f''(x)$.\n$$m^{\\star} = \\inf_{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{-1, 1\\}} f''(x)$$\nWe can now compute this value. The values that $f''(x)$ takes on its domain of definition are $2$, $0$, and $1$. The set of values is $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\nThe infimum of this set is:\n$$m^{\\star} = \\inf \\{0, 1, 2\\} = 0$$\nThe global strong convexity modulus for the function $f(x)$ is $m^{\\star}=0$.\n\nBy definition, a function is strongly convex if its strong convexity modulus $m$ is strictly positive ($m0$). Our result, $m^{\\star}=0$, represents the supremum of all $m$ for which $f$ is $m$-strongly convex. This means that for any $m0$, the function $f$ is not $m$-strongly convex. For example, if we test $m=0.5$, the condition $f''(x) \\geq 0.5$ fails on the interval $(-1, 1)$ where $f''(x)=0$. The case $m=0$ corresponds to standard convexity. Thus, the result $m^{\\star}=0$ demonstrates that the function $f$ is convex, but it is not strongly convex.
