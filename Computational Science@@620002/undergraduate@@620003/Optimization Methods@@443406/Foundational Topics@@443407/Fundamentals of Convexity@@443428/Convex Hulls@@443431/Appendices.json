The endpoints of this arc are $A=(-1, 1)$ and $B=(1, 1)$. The convex hull, $\\operatorname{conv}(S)$, is the smallest convex set containing $S$. This is the region bounded below by the parabolic arc $y=x^2$ and above by the line segment connecting the endpoints $A$ and $B$, which is the line $y=1$ for $x \\in [-1,1]$.\n\n**Part 2: Inequality Description for $\\operatorname{conv}(S)$**\n\nThe convex hull $\\operatorname{conv}(S)$ can be described as the set of points $(x,y)$ that satisfy the inequalities:\n$$y \\ge x^{2}$$\n$$y \\le 1$$\nThe condition $x \\in [-1, 1]$ is implied by these two inequalities, since $y \\ge x^2$ and $y \\le 1$ together require $x^2 \\le 1$.\n\n**Part 3: Maximization of $L(x,y) = x - 2y$**\n\nWe seek to solve the optimization problem:\n$$\\max_{(x,y) \\in \\operatorname{conv}(S)} L(x,y) = \\max_{(x,y) \\in \\operatorname{conv}(S)} (x - 2y)$$\nA fundamental result in convex optimization states that the maximum of a linear functional over a compact convex set is always attained at one of its extreme points.

This is known as the McCormick convex envelope. The convex hull is the tightest convex set containing $S$ and is described by the original box constraints on $x$ and $y$ along with four linear inequalities derived from the non-negativity of products of bound differences.\n1.
