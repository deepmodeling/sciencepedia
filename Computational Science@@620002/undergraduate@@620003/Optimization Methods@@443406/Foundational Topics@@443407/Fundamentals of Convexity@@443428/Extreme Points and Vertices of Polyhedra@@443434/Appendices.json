A vertex, or extreme point, is found at the intersection of at least three linearly independent active constraints.\n\nThe polyhedron $\\mathcal{P}$ is defined by the following inequalities:\n1.  $C_1: x_{1} \\geq 0$\n2.  $C_2: x_{2} \\geq 0$\n3.  $C_3: x_{3} \\geq 0$\n4.  $C_4: x_{1} \\leq 1$\n5.  $C_5: x_{2} \\leq 1$\n6.  $C_6: x_{3} \\leq 1$\n7.  $C_7: x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3} \\leq 2$\n8.  $C_8: x_{1} + x_{2} \\leq 2$\n\nFirst, we analyze the constraints to identify any redundancies. A constraint is redundant if it is implied by other constraints. Consider constraints $C_4$ ($x_1 \\leq 1$) and $C_5$ ($x_2 \\leq 1$). Summing these two inequalities yields $x_1 + x_2 \\leq 1 + 1 = 2$, which is exactly constraint $C_8$. Therefore, any point $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ that satisfies $C_4$ and $C_5$ automatically satisfies $C_8$. As all points in $\\mathcal{P}$ must satisfy all constraints, including $C_4$ and $C_5$, the constraint $C_8$ is redundant. Removing it does not alter the polyhedron $\\mathcal{P}$.\n\nThe polyhedron is thus defined by constraints $C_1$ through $C_7$. Geometrically, this is the unit cube defined by $C_1$ through $C_6$ ($0 \\le x_1 \\le 1, 0 \\le x_2 \\le 1, 0 \\le x_3 \\le 1$) truncated by the half-space defined by $C_7$ ($x_1+x_2+x_3 \\le 2$).\n\nTo find the vertices, we must find all points that are solutions to systems of three equality constraints, check for linear independence of the constraint normals, and verify that the solution point satisfies all remaining inequalities.

Any intersection involving $E_8$ will either be infeasible, coincide with an existing vertex, or represent a rank-deficient system.\n-   $\\{E_4, E_5, E_8\\} \\implies x_1=1, x_2=1, x_1+x_2=2$. The normals $(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (1,1,0)$ are linearly dependent. The intersection is the line $(1, 1, z)$, not a point.

The normals $(0,0,1), (1,1,1), (1,1,0)$ are linearly dependent $((1,1,1)-(0,0,1)=(1,1,0))$. This system is rank-deficient, defining the line $x_3=0, x_1+x_2=2$.\n\nAll combinations involving $E_8$ do not generate any new vertices. This confirms the impact of a redundant constraint: while it can be active at a vertex (e.g., at $P_5=(1,1,0)$), it does not introduce new vertices to the polyhedron. The set of vertices is completely determined by the non-redundant constraints.\n\nThe set of unique, feasible vertices is:\n$V = \\{ (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1) \\}$.\nCounting these points, we find there are 7 genuine vertices.\n\nFinal count: The total number of genuine vertices of the polyhedron $\\mathcal{P}$ is the number of unique points found.\nTotal number of vertices = $7$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7}$$", "id": "3127486"}, {"introduction": "While many vertices are \"simple,\" formed by the intersection of exactly $n$ hyperplanes in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, we often encounter \"degenerate\" vertices where more than $n$ constraints are simultaneously active.

This means the seventh inequality is satisfied by all points in the unit cube. Consequently, the seventh inequality is redundant, and the polyhedron $P$ is precisely the unit cube $[0,1]^3$.\n\nTo show $P$ is nonempty, we can exhibit a point in it.

The first equation gives $-x_1=0 \\implies x_1=0$. The second gives $-x_2=0 \\implies x_2=0$. Substituting these into the third gives $-0 - 0 - x_3 = 0 \\implies x_3=0$. The unique solution is again $x=(0,0,0)$.\nThis demonstrates that two different sets of $3$ linearly independent tight constraints define the same degenerate vertex.\n\nFinally, we compute the number of distinct $3$-element bases that define this degenerate vertex. We must find how many $3$-element subsets of the tight constraint indices $I(x)=\\{1,3,5,7\\}$ correspond to linearly independent normal vectors. There are $\\binom{4}{3}=4$ such subsets.

Active Constraints and the Normal Cone**\n\nFirst, we identify which of the five defining inequalities are active (i.e., hold with equality) at the vertex $v = (2,1)$. Let $x=(x_1,x_2)$.\n1. $-x_1 \\leq 0 \\implies -2 \\leq 0$ (inactive)\n2. $-x_2 \\leq 0 \\implies -1 \\leq 0$ (inactive)\n3. $x_1 \\leq 2 \\implies 2 \\leq 2$ (active)\n4. $x_2 \\leq 2 \\implies 1 \\leq 2$ (inactive)\n5. $x_1 + x_2 \\leq 3 \\implies 2 + 1 \\leq 3$ (active)\n\nThe active constraints are $x_1 \\leq 2$ and $x_1+x_2 \\leq 3$. The outward normal vectors of the half-spaces defined by these constraints are the gradients of the functions on the left-hand side.\nFor $x_1 \\leq 2$, the outward normal vector is $n_1 = (1,0)$.\nFor $x_1+x_2 \\leq 3$, the outward normal vector is $n_2 = (1,1)$.\n\nThe normal cone $N_{P}(v)$ at a vertex $v$ of a polyhedron is the conic hull of the outward normal vectors of the constraints that are active at $v$.\nTherefore, the normal cone at $v = (2,1)$ is:\n$$N_{P}(v) = \\text{cone}\\{n_1, n_2\\} = \\{ \\lambda_1 n_1 + \\lambda_2 n_2 \\mid \\lambda_1 \\geq 0, \\lambda_2 \\geq 0 \\}$$\nSubstituting the normal vectors, we get:\n$$N_{P}(v) = \\{ \\lambda_1 (1,0) + \\lambda_2 (1,1) \\mid \\lambda_1 \\geq 0, \\lambda_2 \\geq 0 \\}$$\n$$N_{P}(v) = \\{ (\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2, \\lambda_2) \\mid \\lambda_1 \\geq 0, \\lambda_2 \\geq 0 \\}$$\n\n**2. Construction of the Cost Vector**\n\nFor $v$ to be the *unique* optimizer of $\\max\\{c^{\\top}x : x \\in P\\}$, the cost vector $c$ must lie in the relative interior of the normal cone $N_{P}(v)$. This means that $c$ must be a conic combination of $n_1$ and $n_2$ with strictly positive coefficients.\n$$c = \\lambda_1 n_1 + \\lambda_2 n_2, \\quad \\text{with } \\lambda_1 > 0 \\text{ and } \\lambda_2 > 0$$\nLet $c = (c_1, c_2)$. From the expression for $N_P(v)$, we have $c_1 = \\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2$ and $c_2 = \\lambda_2$.\nThe conditions $\\lambda_1 > 0$ and $\\lambda_2 > 0$ translate to:\n1. $\\lambda_2 > 0 \\implies c_2 > 0$\n2. $\\lambda_1 > 0 \\implies c_1 - \\lambda_2 > 0 \\implies c_1 - c_2 > 0 \\implies c_1 > c_2$\n\nSo, we need to find a cost vector $c=(c_1, c_2)$ with integer entries that satisfies $c_1 > c_2 > 0$. The simplest such choice is to set $c_2 = 1$ and $c_1 = 2$.\nLet's choose the cost vector $c = (2,1)$.\nThis vector corresponds to $\\lambda_2 = 1 > 0$ and $\\lambda_1 = c_1 - c_2 = 2 - 1 = 1 > 0$. Since both coefficients are strictly positive, $c = (2,1)$ lies in the relative interior of $N_{P}(v)$.\n\n**3. Validation of Uniqueness via Perturbation**\n\nTo validate that $v=(2,1)$ is the unique maximizer, we analyze the behavior of the objective function $f(x) = c^{\\top}x = 2x_1 + x_2$ along the feasible directions at $v$. The feasible directions are along the edges of the polyhedron $P$ that emanate from $v$. These edges are formed by the intersection of one active constraint boundary and the interior of the other active constraint's half-space.\n\nThe vertex $v=(2,1)$ lies on the lines $L_1: x_1 = 2$ and $L_2: x_1+x_2 = 3$. The edges of $P$ at $v$ must lie along these lines.\n\nEdge 1: Along $L_1: x_1 = 2$. A point on this edge near $v$ is of the form $(2, 1+\\delta)$ for some small $\\delta$. For this point to be in $P$, it must satisfy all constraints, particularly the other active constraint $x_1+x_2 \\leq 3$.\n$2 + (1+\\delta) \\leq 3 \\implies 3+\\delta \\leq 3 \\implies \\delta \\leq 0$.\nSo, a feasible direction is for decreasing $x_2$. A direction vector for this edge is $d^{(1)} = (0,-1)$.\n\nEdge 2: Along $L_2: x_1+x_2 = 3$. A point on this edge near $v$ is of the form $(2+\\delta, 1-\\delta)$. For this point to be in $P$, it must satisfy $x_1 \\leq 2$.\n$2+\\delta \\leq 2 \\implies \\delta \\leq 0$.\nSo, a feasible direction is for decreasing $x_1$ and increasing $x_2$. A direction vector for this edge is $d^{(2)} = (-1,1)$.\n\nNow we compute the directional derivative of the objective function $f(x)=c^{\\top}x$ in these feasible directions. The directional derivative is given by $c^{\\top}d$. For $v$ to be a unique maximizer, the objective function must strictly decrease along any feasible direction away from $v$. This means $c^{\\top}d$ must be strictly negative for all feasible directions $d$.\n\nFor direction $d^{(1)} = (0,-1)$:\n$$c^{\\top}d^{(1)} = (2,1) \\cdot (0,-1) = 2(0) + 1(-1) = -1$$\nSince $c^{\\top}d^{(1)} < 0$, moving from $v$ along this edge decreases the objective value.\n\nFor direction $d^{(2)} = (-1,1)$:\n$$c^{\\top}d^{(2)} = (2,1) \\cdot (-1,1) = 2(-1) + 1(1) = -2 + 1 = -1$$\nSince $c^{\\top}d^{(2)} < 0$, moving from $v$ along this edge also decreases the objective value.\n\nSince $P$ is a convex set, any feasible point $y \\in P$ different from $v$ can be reached by moving from $v$ in a direction $y-v$ which is a conic combination of the feasible edge directions. That is, for any $y \\in P$, $y-v = \\alpha_1 d^{(1)} + \\alpha_2 d^{(2)} + \\dots$ for $\\alpha_i \\ge 0$. More formally, any point $y \\in P$ near $v$ can be expressed as $v + \\alpha_1 d^{(1)} + \\alpha_2 d^{(2)}$ for small $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2 \\ge 0$. Then $c^\\top(y-v) = \\alpha_1(c^\\top d^{(1)}) + \\alpha_2(c^\\top d^{(2)}) = -\\alpha_1 - \\alpha_2$. As long as $y \\neq v$, at least one $\\alpha_i$ is positive, so $c^\\top(y-v) < 0$, which implies $c^\\top y < c^\\top v$. By convexity, this holds for all $y \\in P, y \\neq v$.\n\nThus, $v=(2,1)$ is the strict and therefore unique maximizer of the linear program $\\max \\{c^{\\top}x : x \\in P\\}$ for the cost vector $c = (2,1)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3127417"}]}
