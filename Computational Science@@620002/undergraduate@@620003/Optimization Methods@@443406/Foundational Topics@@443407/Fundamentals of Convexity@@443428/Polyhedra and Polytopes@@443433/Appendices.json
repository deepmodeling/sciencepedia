The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the theory of linear programming and polyhedral geometry, is well-posed with a complete and consistent setup, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We will address the three tasks in order.\n\nThe first task is to compute the optimal objective value of the LP:\n$$\n\\max\\; c^{\\top}x \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad x \\in P\n$$\nwhere $c = (1,1,1)$ and the set $P \\;=\\; \\{\\, x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\mid x_{1} \\geq 0,\\; x_{2} \\geq 0,\\; x_{3} \\geq 0,\\; x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3} \\leq 1 \\,\\}$.\nThe objective function is $c^{\\top}x = 1 \\cdot x_1 + 1 \\cdot x_2 + 1 \\cdot x_3 = x_1 + x_2 + x_3$.\nThe feasible set $P$ is defined by four linear inequalities. One of these inequalities is $x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3} \\leq 1$. This inequality provides a direct upper bound on the objective function for any feasible point $x \\in P$. Specifically, for any $x \\in P$, the value of the objective function $x_1 + x_2 + x_3$ must be less than or equal to $1$.\nLet $z^* = \\max\\{c^{\\top}x \\mid x \\in P\\}$. We have established that $z^* \\leq 1$. To show that $1$ is indeed the maximum, we must verify that this value is attainable for at least one point in $P$. Consider the point $x^* = (1, 0, 0)$. We check if $x^* \\in P$:\n1. $x_1 = 1 \\geq 0$\n2. $x_2 = 0 \\geq 0$\n3. $x_3 = 0 \\geq 0$\n4. $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 \\leq 1$\nAll four conditions are satisfied, so $x^* \\in P$. The value of the objective function at this point is $c^{\\top}x^* = 1+0+0=1$.\nSince the objective function is bounded above by $1$ and we have found a point in $P$ where the objective value is $1$, we conclude that the optimal objective value is $z^*=1$.\n\nThe second task is to explain why the set of optimizers is a non-vertex face of $P$, using fundamental definitions.\nFirst, we state the relevant definitions. A hyperplane in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a set $H = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\mid a^{\\top}x = \\beta\\}$ for a non-zero vector $a \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and a scalar $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}$. A hyperplane $H$ is called a supporting hyperplane of a polyhedron $P$ if $P \\cap H \\neq \\emptyset$ and $P$ is contained entirely in one of the closed half-spaces defined by $H$ (i.e., $a^{\\top}x \\leq \\beta$ for all $x \\in P$, or $a^{\\top}x \\geq \\beta$ for all $x \\in P$). A subset $F \\subseteq P$ is a face of $P$ if either $F=P$ or $F = P \\cap H$ for some supporting hyperplane $H$ of $P$.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of optimizers for the given LP. By definition, $S = \\{x \\in P \\mid c^{\\top}x = z^*\\}$. From our prior calculation, $z^*=1$ and $c=(1,1,1)$, so $S = \\{x \\in P \\mid x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 1\\}$. Let us define the hyperplane $H^* = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\mid x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 1\\}$. We check if $H^*$ is a supporting hyperplane of $P$:\n1. The intersection $P \\cap H^*$ is non-empty. As shown before, the point $(1,0,0)$ belongs to both $P$ and $H^*$.\n2. The polyhedron $P$ is contained in one of the closed half-spaces defined by $H^*$. By definition of $P$, every point $x \\in P$ satisfies $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 \\leq 1$. This means $P$ is entirely contained in the closed half-space $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\mid x_1 + x_2 + x_3 \\leq 1\\}$.\nBoth conditions are satisfied, so $H^*$ is a supporting hyperplane of $P$. The set of optimizers $S = P \\cap H^*$ is therefore a face of $P$.\n\nTo show that $S$ is a non-vertex face, we examine its properties. A vertex is a face of dimension $0$. The face $S$ is the set of points satisfying all the constraints of $P$ plus the additional equality $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 1$. This gives:\n$$\nS = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\mid x_{1} \\geq 0,\\; x_{2} \\geq 0,\\; x_{3} \\geq 0,\\; x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3} = 1 \\}\n$$\nThis set is the convex hull of the points $(1,0,0)$, $(0,1,0)$, and $(0,0,1)$. These three points are themselves vertices of $P$. Geometrically, $S$ is a triangle in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. The affine hull of $S$ is the plane $x_1+x_2+x_3=1$, which has dimension $2$. Therefore, $S$ is a $2$-dimensional face of $P$. Since its dimension is $2 > 0$, it is not a vertex (a $0$-dimensional face). Thus, the set of optimizers is a non-vertex face.\n\nThe third task is to define non-degeneracy and explain its implications for the nature of the optimal set.\nAn objective vector $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is non-degenerate with respect to a polyhedron $P \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ if the linear program $\\max \\{ c^\\top x \\mid x \\in P \\}$ has a unique optimal solution.\n\nNow, we explain why, under this definition, the optimum cannot lie on any positive-dimensional (non-vertex) face.\nLet $z^* = \\max \\{ c^\\top x \\mid x \\in P \\}$. The set of all optimal solutions, $F^*$, is given by $F^* = \\{ x \\in P \\mid c^\\top x = z^* \\}$. As established, $F^*$ is always a face of the polyhedron $P$.\nIf the objective vector $c$ is non-degenerate, its definition requires that the set of optimal solutions $F^*$ must contain exactly one point. Let this unique solution be $v$, so $F^* = \\{v\\}$.\nBy definition, a vertex of a polyhedron is a face of dimension $0$. A face consisting of a single point is a $0$-dimensional set. Therefore, if $F^*$ contains a single point $v$, then $F^*$ is a $0$-dimensional face of $P$, and $v$ is a vertex of $P$.\nIf the optimum of the LP were to lie on a positive-dimensional face $F'$, this would mean that $F'$ is the set of optimizers, i.e., $F' = F^*$. A face $F'$ with dimension $d > 0$ is a convex set that contains more than one point (in fact, infinitely many). For example, if $x_a$ and $x_b$ are two distinct points in $F'$, then all points on the line segment connecting them, $x_\\lambda = (1-\\lambda)x_a + \\lambda x_b$ for $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$, are also in $F'$ (since faces are convex). All these points $x_\\lambda$ would be optimal solutions, as $c^\\top x_\\lambda = (1-\\lambda)c^\\top x_a + \\lambda c^\\top x_b = (1-\\lambda)z^* + \\lambda z^* = z^*$. The existence of multiple optimal solutions contradicts the definition of a non-degenerate objective, which requires a unique solution.\nTherefore, if $c$ is non-degenerate, the optimal face $F^*$ must have dimension $0$. It must be a single vertex, and it cannot be a positive-dimensional (non-vertex) face.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3162439"}, {"introduction": "Polyhedra can often be understood as \"shadows,\" or projections, of simpler objects in higher dimensions.

It is scientifically grounded in the established theory of convex geometry and optimization, well-posed with clear definitions and objectives, and expressed in objective, formal language. It is a standard, illustrative example in the study of polyhedral combinatorics. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is presented in four parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Integrality of the Polytope $H$**\n\nThe polytope $H$ is defined as the convex hull of the set of points $V_H = \\left\\{(u,v,w) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3} : u \\in \\{0,1\\},\\ v \\in \\{0,1\\},\\ w \\in \\{0,1\\}\\right\\}$. This set consists of the $8$ points:\n$$V_H = \\{(0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), (1,1,1)\\}$$\nBy definition, a polytope is the convex hull of its vertices. Therefore, the set $V_H$ is the vertex set of the polytope $H$.\nA polytope is defined as integral if all of its vertices have coordinates that belong to the integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^n$. For $H \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$, we must check if its vertices lie in $\\mathbb{Z}^3$.\nFor every vertex $(u,v,w) \\in V_H$, the coordinates $u$, $v$, and $w$ are either $0$ or $1$. Both $0$ and $1$ are integers. Thus, all $8$ vertices of $H$ are points in the integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^3$.\nConsequently, by definition, $H$ is an integral polytope.\n\n2.  **Vertex Set of the Polytope $Q$ and its Non-Integrality**\n\nThe polytope $Q$ is the image of the polytope $H$ under the linear projection $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ defined by $\\pi(u,v,w) = \\left(u + \\frac{1}{2}w,\\ v + \\frac{1}{2}w\\right)$.\nSince a linear projection maps a polytope to another polytope, $Q = \\pi(H)$ is a polytope. The vertices of $Q$ are the images of some subset of the vertices of $H$. More formally, if $V_H$ is the vertex set of $H$, then $Q = \\operatorname{conv}(\\pi(V_H))$, and the vertex set of $Q$, denoted $V_Q$, is a subset of $\\pi(V_H)$.\n\nLet's compute the images of the $8$ vertices of $H$ under $\\pi$:\n$p_1 = \\pi(0,0,0) = (0,0)$\n$p_2 = \\pi(1,0,0) = (1,0)$\n$p_3 = \\pi(0,1,0) = (0,1)$\n$p_4 = \\pi(1,1,0) = (1,1)$\n$p_5 = \\pi(0,0,1) = (1/2, 1/2)$\n$p_6 = \\pi(1,0,1) = (3/2, 1/2)$\n$p_7 = \\pi(0,1,1) = (1/2, 3/2)$\n$p_8 = \\pi(1,1,1) = (3/2, 3/2)$\n\nThe set of projected points is $P = \\pi(V_H) = \\{(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1/2, 1/2), (3/2, 1/2), (1/2, 3/2), (3/2, 3/2)\\}$. The polytope $Q$ is the convex hull of these $8$ points.\n\nTo determine the vertices of $Q$, we identify the extreme points in the set $P$. A point is a vertex if it cannot be expressed as a convex combination of other points in $P$.\n- The point $p_4 = (1,1)$ can be written as a convex combination of $p_6$ and $p_7$: $(1,1) = \\frac{1}{2}(3/2, 1/2) + \\frac{1}{2}(1/2, 3/2)$. Thus, $(1,1)$ is not a vertex.\n- The point $p_5 = (1/2, 1/2)$ can be written as a convex combination of $p_1$ and $p_4$: $(1/2, 1/2) = \\frac{1}{2}(0,0) + \\frac{1}{2}(1,1)$. Since $p_4$ is in $\\operatorname{conv}(P)$, $p_5$ is also in the interior of $Q$ and is not a vertex.\n\nThe remaining $6$ points are the vertices of $Q$. We can verify this using the geometric characterization of vertices via supporting hyperplanes. A point $v \\in Q$ is a vertex if there exists a vector $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $c^T v > c^T x$ for all other $x \\in Q$. It is sufficient to check this for $x \\in P$.\n- For $(3/2, 3/2)$: let $c=(1,1)$. $c^T(x,y) = x+y$. The values for the points in $P$ are $\\{0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3\\}$. The maximum value of $3$ is uniquely achieved at $(3/2, 3/2)$. Thus, it is a vertex.\n- For $(3/2, 1/2)$: let $c=(2,-1)$. $c^T(x,y) = 2x-y$. The values for $P$ are $\\{0, 2, -1, 1, 1/2, 5/2, -1/2, 3/2\\}$. The maximum of $5/2$ is uniquely achieved at $(3/2, 1/2)$. Thus, it is a vertex.\n- For $(1,0)$: let $c=(1,-2)$. $c^T(x,y) = x-2y$. The values for $P$ are $\\{0, 1, -2, -1, -1/2, 1/2, -5/2, -3/2\\}$. The maximum of $1$ is uniquely achieved at $(1,0)$. Thus, it is a vertex.\nSimilar arguments with cost vectors $c=(-1,-1)$, $c=(-2,1)$, and $c=(-1,2)$ confirm that $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(1/2, 3/2)$ are also vertices.\n\nThe vertex set of $Q$ is therefore:\n$$V_Q = \\left\\{(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (3/2, 1/2), (1/2, 3/2), (3/2, 3/2)\\right\\}$$\nThe polytope $Q$ is non-integral because it has vertices with non-integer coordinates. For instance, the vertex $(3/2, 1/2)$ has coordinates that are not in $\\mathbb{Z}$. This demonstrates that the projection of an integral polytope is not necessarily integral.\n\n3.  **Number of Vertices with Fractional Coordinates**\n\nWe examine the coordinates of each vertex in $V_Q$ to identify those with at least one non-integer (fractional) coordinate.\n- $(0,0)$: Both coordinates are integers.\n- $(1,0)$: Both coordinates are integers.\n- $(0,1)$: Both coordinates are integers.\n- $(3/2, 1/2)$: Both coordinates, $3/2$ and $1/2$, are non-integers. This vertex has fractional coordinates.\n- $(1/2, 3/2)$: Both coordinates, $1/2$ and $3/2$, are non-integers. This vertex has fractional coordinates.\n- $(3/2, 3/2)$: Both coordinates, $3/2$ and $3/2$, are non-integers. This vertex has fractional coordinates.\n\nCounting these vertices, we find there are $3$ vertices that have at least one fractional coordinate.\n\n4.  **Implication for Extended Formulations**\n\nThis example illustrates a key concept in the use of extended formulations in optimization. The polytope $H \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$ serves as an extended formulation for the polytope $Q \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$. The desirable property of $H$ is its integrality; all its vertices are integer points. This means that optimizing a linear function over $H$ via the simplex method (a linear programming solver) will always yield an integer-valued vertex.\n\nHowever, the property of integrality is not necessarily preserved under linear projection. As demonstrated, optimizing a linear function over $H$ might result in an optimal vertex like $(1,0,1)$. When this integer solution in the extended space is projected back to the original space via $\\pi$, the resulting point is $\\pi(1,0,1) = (3/2, 1/2)$. This projected point is a vertex of $Q$, but it is not an integer point.\n\nThe implication is that while an extended formulation can provide a simpler or more structured representation of a complex polytope (e.g., an integral polytope with a simple inequality description like the unit cube), one cannot assume that the desirable properties of the extended formulation, such as integrality, will carry over to the original polytope. If an optimization problem requires an integer solution in the original space (i.e., over $Q \\cap \\mathbb{Z}^2$), simply solving the problem over the extended integral polytope $H$ and projecting the solution back is not a valid general strategy, as it may yield a fractional solution.

This number is known as the Chvátal-Gomory rank of $P$.

Determination of the Integer Hull ($P_I$)**\n\nThe integer hull of $P$, denoted $P_I$, is defined as the convex hull of the set of all integer points contained in $P$. Formally, $P_I = \\operatorname{conv}\\left(P \\cap \\mathbb{Z}^{2}\\right)$.\n\nFirst, we identify the set of integer points $P \\cap \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$. For a point $(x,y)$ to be in $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, both $x$ and $y$ must be integers. The constraints $x \\ge 0$ and $x \\le 1$ imply that $x$ can only be $0$ or $1$. Similarly, the constraints $y \\ge 0$ and $y \\le 1$ imply that $y$ can only be $0$ or $1$. This gives us four candidate integer points: $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(1,1)$.\n\nWe must check which of these candidates satisfy the final constraint of $P$, which is $x+y \\le \\frac{3}{2}$.\n- For the point $(0,0)$: $0+0 = 0 \\le \\frac{3}{2}$, so $(0,0) \\in P$.\n- For the point $(1,0)$: $1+0 = 1 \\le \\frac{3}{2}$, so $(1,0) \\in P$.\n- For the point $(0,1)$: $0+1 = 1 \\le \\frac{3}{2}$, so $(0,1) \\in P$.\n- For the point $(1,1)$: $1+1 = 2 \\not\\le \\frac{3}{2}$, so $(1,1) \\notin P$.\n\nThus, the set of integer points in $P$ is $P \\cap \\mathbb{Z}^{2} = \\{(0,0), (1,0), (0,1)\\}$.\n\nNext, we find the convex hull of this set of points. Since the three points $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(0,1)$ are not collinear, their convex hull is the triangle with these points as its vertices. The extreme points of $P_I$ are therefore $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(0,1)$.\n\nThe irredundant linear description of this triangle is derived from its boundary edges:\n- The edge connecting $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$ lies on the line $y=0$. Since the triangle is above this line, we have the inequality $y \\ge 0$.\n- The edge connecting $(0,0)$ and $(0,1)$ lies on the line $x=0$. Since the triangle is to the right of this line, we have the inequality $x \\ge 0$.\n- The edge connecting $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ lies on the line $x+y=1$. Since the triangle (and its interior) is on the side of the origin, we have the inequality $x+y \\le 1$.\n\nSo, the integer hull is given by the following set of linear inequalities:\n$$\nP_I = \\left\\{ (x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x \\ge 0, y \\ge 0, x+y \\le 1 \\right\\}.\n$$\n\n**2. The First Chvátal-Gomory Closure ($P_1$)**\n\nThe first Chvátal-Gomory closure, $P_1$, is obtained by adding all valid Chvátal-Gomory (CG) cuts to the linear description of $P$. A CG cut is an inequality of the form $u^{\\top}A \\mathbf{x} \\le \\lfloor u^{\\top} \\mathbf{b} \\rfloor$, derived from a system $A\\mathbf{x} \\le \\mathbf{b}$, where $u$ is a non-negative vector of multipliers chosen such that the vector $u^{\\top}A$ has integer components.\n\nLet's write the constraints of $P$ in the form $A\\mathbf{x} \\le \\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{x} = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}\n\\le\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n3/2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nA CG cut is generated by taking a non-negative linear combination of these inequalities using a multiplier vector $u = (u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4, u_5)^{\\top} \\ge 0$. The combined inequality is $(u_3-u_1+u_5)x + (u_4-u_2+u_5)y \\le u_3+u_4+\\frac{3}{2}u_5$. For this to be the basis of a CG cut, the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ must be integers. The resulting cut is then $(u_3-u_1+u_5)x + (u_4-u_2+u_5)y \\le \\lfloor u_3+u_4+\\frac{3}{2}u_5 \\rfloor$.\n\nTo generate a cut that strengthens the description of $P$, the right-hand side must be \"rounded down\". This can only happen if the value $u^{\\top}\\mathbf{b}$ is not an integer. The only source of non-integrality in the vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is its last component, $b_5 = \\frac{3}{2}$. Therefore, any non-trivial cut must have $u_5 > 0$.\n\nLet's consider the simplest choice that uses the fifth inequality: $u = (0,0,0,0,1)^{\\top}$.\n- The condition $u \\ge 0$ is met.\n- The coefficient vector is $u^{\\top}A = (1,1)$, which is an integer vector.\n- The right-hand side is $u^{\\top}\\mathbf{b} = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n- The CG cut is $1 \\cdot x + 1 \\cdot y \\le \\lfloor \\frac{3}{2} \\rfloor$, which simplifies to $x+y \\le 1$.\n\nThe first closure $P_1$ is the intersection of $P$ with all possible CG cuts. Since $x+y \\le 1$ is a valid CG cut, any point in $P_1$ must satisfy it. This implies $P_1 \\subseteq P \\cap \\{ (x,y) \\mid x+y \\le 1 \\}$. Let's analyze this intersection:\n$$\nP \\cap \\{ (x,y) \\mid x+y \\le 1 \\} = \\left\\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x \\ge 0, y \\ge 0, x \\le 1, y \\le 1, x+y \\le \\tfrac{3}{2}, x+y \\le 1 \\right\\}.\n$$\nWe can immediately see that the constraint $x+y \\le 1$ makes the constraint $x+y \\le \\frac{3}{2}$ redundant. Furthermore, if $x \\ge 0, y \\ge 0,$ and $x+y \\le 1$, then it necessarily follows that $x \\le 1-y \\le 1$ and $y \\le 1-x \\le 1$. Thus, the constraints $x \\le 1$ and $y \\le 1$ are also redundant. The simplified description of the intersection is:\n$$\n\\left\\{ (x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x \\ge 0, y \\ge 0, x+y \\le 1 \\right\\}.\n$$\nThis is precisely the description of the integer hull $P_I$ that we found in the first part. Therefore, we have shown that $P_1 \\subseteq P_I$.\n\nBy construction, any CG cut is valid for all integer points in $P$, i.e., for the set $P \\cap \\mathbb{Z}^2$. Since $P_I$ is the convex hull of these points, any valid CG cut must also be valid for all points in $P_I$. The first closure $P_1$ is the set of points in $P$ satisfying all such cuts. Since points in $P_I$ are in $P$ and satisfy all CG cuts, it must be that $P_I \\subseteq P_1$.\n\nCombining the two inclusions, $P_1 \\subseteq P_I$ and $P_I \\subseteq P_1$, we conclude that $P_1 = P_I$.\n\n**3. Chvátal-Gomory Rank**\n\nThe Chvátal-Gomory rank of a polyhedron $P$ is the smallest integer $k \\ge 0$ such that $P_k = P_I$, where $P_0 = P$ and $P_{i+1} = (P_i)_1$. In our case, we have found that the first Chvátal-Gomory closure $P_1$ is equal to the integer hull $P_I$. This means the process of generating closures terminates after one step.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of Chvátal-Gomory rounds required to obtain the integer hull from $P$ is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3162389"}]}
