We are given the objective function $f(x,y)=x^{2}y^{2}+x^{2}+y^{2}$ and the equality constraint $g(x,y)=x+y=0$. We will follow the specified tasks to find the constrained stationary points and analyze the second-order conditions.\n\nThe first step is to define the Lagrangian function, $L(x, y, \\lambda)$, for this problem. The Lagrangian is given by $L(x, y, \\lambda) = f(x, y) - \\lambda g(x, y)$.\n$$L(x,y,\\lambda) = x^{2}y^{2}+x^{2}+y^{2} - \\lambda(x+y)$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the constraint.\n\n**Task 1: Determine the constrained stationary point(s).**\n\nWe find the stationary points by applying the first-order necessary conditions, which state that the gradient of the Lagrangian with respect to all variables must be zero. These are the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for equality constraints.\n\nThe gradient of the Lagrangian is:\n$$ \\nabla L(x,y,\\lambda) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\lambda} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThis yields the following system of equations:\n1. $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} = 2xy^{2} + 2x - \\lambda = 0$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} = 2x^{2}y + 2y - \\lambda = 0$\n3. $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\lambda} = -(x+y) = 0 \\implies x+y=0$\n\nFrom a purely mathematical viewpoint, the condition on $\\lambda$ is that the gradient with respect to the primal variables is zero, and the final equation is the constraint itself. Setting $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\lambda}=0$ is a convenient way to recover the constraint.\n\nFrom the third equation, we have $y = -x$. We substitute this into the first two equations.\nSubstituting $y=-x$ into equation (1):\n$$ 2x(-x)^{2} + 2x - \\lambda = 0 \\implies 2x^{3} + 2x - \\lambda = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda = 2x^{3} + 2x $$\nSubstituting $y=-x$ into equation (2):\n$$ 2x^{2}(-x) + 2(-x) - \\lambda = 0 \\implies -2x^{3} - 2x - \\lambda = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda = -2x^{3} - 2x $$\n\nEquating the two expressions for $\\lambda$:\n$$ 2x^{3} + 2x = -2x^{3} - 2x $$\n$$ 4x^{3} + 4x = 0 $$\n$$ 4x(x^{2} + 1) = 0 $$\n\nThe term $x^{2}+1$ is always positive for any real number $x$. Therefore, the only real solution is $x=0$.\nIf $x=0$, then $y = -x = 0$.\nWe can find the corresponding value of $\\lambda$ using either expression. For instance, using $\\lambda = 2x^{3} + 2x$, we get $\\lambda = 2(0)^{3} + 2(0) = 0$.\n\nThus, there is a single constrained stationary point $(x^*, y^*) = (0,0)$, with the associated Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda^* = 0$.\n\n**Task 2: Construct the reduced Hessian of the Lagrangian.**\n\nThe second-order conditions involve the Hessian of the Lagrangian with respect to the variables $x$ and $y$, denoted as $\\nabla_{xx}^{2} L$.\nFirst, we compute the second partial derivatives of $L(x,y,\\lambda)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^{2} L}{\\partial x^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(2xy^{2} + 2x - \\lambda) = 2y^{2} + 2 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^{2} L}{\\partial y^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(2x^{2}y + 2y - \\lambda) = 2x^{2} + 2 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^{2} L}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(2xy^{2} + 2x - \\lambda) = 4xy $$\n\nThe Hessian matrix of the Lagrangian is:\n$$ \\nabla_{xx}^{2} L(x,y,\\lambda) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2y^{2}+2 & 4xy \\\\ 4xy & 2x^{2}+2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nNext, we evaluate this Hessian at the stationary point $(x^*, y^*, \\lambda^*) = (0,0,0)$:\n$$ H_L = \\nabla_{xx}^{2} L(0,0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2(0)^{2}+2 & 4(0)(0) \\\\ 4(0)(0) & 2(0)^{2}+2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe reduced Hessian is constructed by projecting this Hessian onto the nullspace of the constraint Jacobian. The constraint Jacobian, $A$, is the transpose of the gradient of the constraint function $g(x,y)$:\n$$ \\nabla g(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ A(x,y) = \\nabla g(x,y)^{T} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe nullspace of $A$ consists of all vectors $v = \\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\end{pmatrix}$ such that $Av=0$, which means $1 \\cdot v_x + 1 \\cdot v_y = 0$, or $v_y = -v_x$. Any vector in the nullspace is a multiple of $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe problem provides an orthonormal basis for this nullspace, which we denote by the matrix $Z$. In this case, the nullspace is one-dimensional, so $Z$ is a column vector:\n$$ Z = z = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe reduced Hessian, $H_R$, is defined as $H_R = Z^{T} H_L Z$. We now compute this product:\n$$ H_R = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) $$\n$$ H_R = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFirst, we perform the multiplication of the first two matrices:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(2)+(-1)(0) & (1)(0)+(-1)(2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow, we multiply this result by the last vector:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = (2)(1) + (-2)(-1) = 2 + 2 = 4 $$\nFinally, we multiply by the scalar factor $\\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$ H_R = \\frac{1}{2} (4) = 2 $$\nThe reduced Hessian is a $1 \\times 1$ matrix, which is the scalar value $2$.\n\n**Task 3: Decide whether the stationary point is a strict local minimum.**\n\nThe second-order sufficient condition for a point $x^*$ to be a strict local minimum is that the reduced Hessian $H_R = Z^{T}(\\nabla_{xx}^{2} L(x^*, \\lambda^*))Z$ is positive definite.\nIn our case, the reduced Hessian is the scalar $2$. A scalar is positive definite if and only if it is a positive number.\nSince $H_R = 2 > 0$, the reduced Hessian is positive definite.\nTherefore, the stationary point $(x^*, y^*) = (0,0)$ is a strict local minimum for the constrained problem.\n\nThe final answer requested is the scalar value of the reduced Hessian obtained in Task 2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3176409"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basic procedure, this exercise explores a more profound concept: how constraints can fundamentally alter the nature of an optimization problem.

A symmetric matrix is indefinite if it has at least one positive eigenvalue and at least one negative eigenvalue. The matrix $Q$ is a diagonal matrix, so its eigenvalues are its diagonal entries. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$, $\\lambda_2 = -1$, and $\\lambda_3 = 2$. Since $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_3$ are positive and $\\lambda_2$ is negative, the matrix $Q$ is, by definition, indefinite. This implies that the quadratic function $f(x)$ is non-convex and has both positive and negative curvature in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Specifically, the quadratic form $x^{\\top}Qx$ is a saddle.\n\n$2$) Next, we identify the set of feasible directions at any feasible point $\\bar{x}$. A point $\\bar{x}$ is feasible if it satisfies the constraint $A\\bar{x} = b$. For a linear equality constraint, the set of feasible directions at any feasible point is the tangent space, which is constant for all feasible points. A direction $d \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is a feasible direction if for a feasible point $\\bar{x}$, the point $\\bar{x}+\\alpha d$ also satisfies the constraint for all sufficiently small scalars $\\alpha$. This requires $A(\\bar{x}+\\alpha d) = b$. Expanding this gives $A\\bar{x} + \\alpha Ad = b$. Since $\\bar{x}$ is feasible, $A\\bar{x} = b$, which simplifies the condition to $\\alpha Ad = 0$. For this to hold for any non-zero $\\alpha$, we must have $Ad=0$. Thus, the set of feasible directions is the null space of the matrix $A$.\nGiven $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, we find the null space by solving $Ad=0$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} d_1 \\\\ d_2 \\\\ d_3 \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\nThis equation simplifies to $d_2 = 0$. The components $d_1$ and $d_3$ can be any real numbers. Therefore, the tangent space, representing the set of all feasible directions, is\n$$ T = \\{ d \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\mid Ad = 0 \\} = \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} d_1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ d_3 \\end{pmatrix} \\mid d_1, d_3 \\in \\mathbb{R} \\right\\} $$\nThis is a $2$-dimensional subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ spanned by the basis vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n$3$) We now examine the curvature of the objective function along these feasible directions. This is determined by the sign of the quadratic form $d^{\\top}Qd$ for any non-zero feasible direction $d \\in T$. Let $d$ be a non-zero vector in the tangent space, so $d = \\begin{pmatrix} d_1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ d_3 \\end{pmatrix}$ where $d_1$ and $d_3$ are not both zero. We compute $d^{\\top}Qd$:\n$$ d^{\\top}Qd = \\begin{pmatrix} d_1 & 0 & d_3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} d_1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ d_3 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ = \\begin{pmatrix} d_1 & 0 & 2d_3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} d_1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ d_3 \\end{pmatrix} = d_1^2 + 2d_3^2 $$\nSince $d_1, d_3 \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $d_1^2 \\ge 0$ and $2d_3^2 \\ge 0$. The sum $d_1^2 + 2d_3^2$ is zero if and only if $d_1 = 0$ and $d_3 = 0$, which corresponds to the zero vector $d=0$. As we are considering non-zero feasible directions, we have $d_1^2 + 2d_3^2 > 0$. This demonstrates that the quadratic form $d^{\\top}Qd$ is strictly positive for all nonzero feasible directions. This means the Hessian of the objective function, $Q$, is positive definite on the tangent space $T$. The negative curvature associated with the eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = -1$ corresponds to the $x_2$ direction. However, the constraint $Ax=b$ (which is $x_2=1$) restricts feasible points to a plane, and feasible directions to the subspace where the second component is zero. This effectively neutralizes the direction of negative curvature, leaving only positive curvature in all allowable directions of movement.\n\n$4$) We derive and solve the first-order necessary conditions for optimality, known as the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for equality constraints. We define the Lagrangian function $L(x, \\lambda) = f(x) - \\lambda (Ax - b)$, where $\\lambda$ is the scalar Lagrange multiplier.\n$$ L(x, \\lambda) = \\frac{1}{2}x^{\\top}Qx + c^{\\top}x - \\lambda(A x - b) $$\nThe first-order necessary conditions for a point $x^{\\star}$ to be a local minimizer are the existence of a multiplier $\\lambda^{\\star}$ such that the gradient of the Lagrangian with respect to $x$ is zero, and the point is feasible:\n$$ \\nabla_x L(x^{\\star}, \\lambda^{\\star}) = Qx^{\\star} + c - A^{\\top}\\lambda^{\\star} = 0 $$\n$$ Ax^{\\star} - b = 0 $$\nSubstituting the given matrices and vectors, we obtain a system of linear equations:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\lambda = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{pmatrix} = 1 $$\nThe feasibility constraint $Ax=b$ gives $x_2 = 1$. The gradient equation yields a system of three scalar equations:\n$1$) $x_1 + 1 = 0 \\implies x_1 = -1$\n$2$) $-x_2 - 2 - \\lambda = 0$\n$3$) $2x_3 + 3 = 0 \\implies x_3 = -\\frac{3}{2}$\nSubstituting $x_2=1$ into the second equation allows us to find the multiplier $\\lambda$:\n$-1 - 2 - \\lambda = 0 \\implies \\lambda = -3$.\nThe candidate optimizer is the point $x^{\\star}$ with components $x_1 = -1$, $x_2 = 1$, and $x_3 = -\\frac{3}{2}$.\n$$ x^{\\star} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -\\frac{3}{2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n$5$) Finally, we verify that $x^{\\star}$ is a strict local minimizer using the second-order sufficient conditions (SOSC). For equality constraints, the SOSC are satisfied at a KKT point $(x^{\\star}, \\lambda^{\\star})$ if the Hessian of the Lagrangian with respect to $x$, evaluated at $x^{\\star}$, is positive definite on the tangent space $T(x^{\\star})$. That is, $d^{\\top} \\nabla_{xx}^2 L(x^{\\star}, \\lambda^{\\star}) d > 0$ for all nonzero $d \\in T(x^{\\star})$.\nThe Hessian of the Lagrangian is $\\nabla_{xx}^2 L(x, \\lambda) = Q$.\nThe SOSC then requires that $d^{\\top}Qd > 0$ for all nonzero $d$ such that $Ad=0$. This is precisely the condition we verified in part $3$). We showed that for any $d \\in T, d \\neq 0$, the quadratic form evaluates to $d^{\\top}Qd = d_1^2 + 2d_3^2 > 0$.\nTo see why this guarantees a strict local minimum, consider a Taylor expansion of $f(x)$ around $x^{\\star}$ along a feasible direction $d \\in T$. For a point $x = x^{\\star} + \\alpha d$, with $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$:\n$$ f(x^{\\star}+\\alpha d) - f(x^{\\star}) = \\alpha \\nabla f(x^{\\star})^{\\top}d + \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha^2 d^{\\top} \\nabla^2 f(x^{\\star}) d + o(\\alpha^2) $$\nFrom the KKT condition $\\nabla_x L(x^{\\star}, \\lambda^{\\star}) = 0$, we have $\\nabla f(x^{\\star}) = A^{\\top}\\lambda^{\\star}$. The first-order term is $\\alpha (A^{\\top}\\lambda^{\\star})^{\\top}d = \\alpha (\\lambda^{\\star})^{\\top} (Ad)$. Since $d \\in T$, we have $Ad=0$, so the first-order term vanishes. The expansion becomes:\n$$ f(x^{\\star}+\\alpha d) - f(x^{\\star}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha^2 d^{\\top} Q d + o(\\alpha^2) $$\nAs established, $d^{\\top}Qd > 0$ for any nonzero $d \\in T$. Thus, for any nonzero $\\alpha$, the term $\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha^2 d^{\\top} Q d$ is strictly positive. For $\\alpha$ sufficiently small, this second-order term dominates the higher-order terms $o(\\alpha^2)$, implying that $f(x^{\\star}+\\alpha d) - f(x^{\\star}) > 0$. This holds for any feasible direction $d$. Consequently, $x^{\\star}$ is a strict local minimizer. The candidate point $x^{\\star} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -\\frac{3}{2} \\end{pmatrix}$ is confirmed to be a strict local minimizer of the constrained problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & -\\frac{3}{2} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3176387"}, {"introduction": "Finally, it is crucial to understand the limitations of our analytical tools.

The point $x^\\star = (0,0)$ must satisfy the constraint $h(x)=0$.\n$h(0,0) = 0$, so the point is feasible.\n\nNext, we establish the Lagrangian function, $L(x, \\lambda) = f(x) + \\lambda h(x)$:\n$$L(x_1, x_2, \\lambda) = x_1^2 + x_2^4 + \\lambda x_1$$\nThe first-order necessary condition states that if $x^\\star$ is a local minimum, then there must exist a Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda^\\star$ such that the gradient of the Lagrangian with respect to $x$ is zero at $(x^\\star, \\lambda^\\star)$, provided $x^\\star$ is a regular point.\nThe gradient of the Lagrangian is:\n$$\\nabla_x L(x, \\lambda) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_1} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x_1 + \\lambda \\\\ 4x_2^3 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nAt the point $x^\\star = (0,0)$, we have:\n$$\\nabla_x L(0,0, \\lambda^\\star) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2(0) + \\lambda^\\star \\\\ 4(0)^3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda^\\star \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nFor the stationarity condition $\\nabla_x L(x^\\star, \\lambda^\\star) = 0$ to hold, we must have $\\lambda^\\star = 0$.\nThe point $x^\\star$ is regular if the gradient of the constraint function at $x^\\star$ is a non-zero vector (and hence linearly independent).\n$$\\nabla h(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nAt $x^\\star = (0,0)$, $\\nabla h(0,0) = (1, 0) \\neq (0,0)$.

Second-Order Conditions**\n\nTo analyze the second-order conditions, we need the Hessian of the Lagrangian and the tangent space at $x^\\star$.\n\nThe tangent space $T(x^\\star)$ is the set of directions $d$ orthogonal to the constraint gradient at $x^\\star$:\n$$T(x^\\star) = \\{ d \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid \\nabla h(x^\\star)^T d = 0 \\}$$\nWith $\\nabla h(x^\\star) = (1,0)$, the condition becomes:\n$$(1, 0) \\begin{pmatrix} d_1 \\\\ d_2 \\end{pmatrix} = d_1 = 0$$\nSo, the tangent space is the set of all vectors of the form $d = (0, d_2)$ where $d_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This is the $x_2$-axis.\n\nNext, we compute the Hessian of the Lagrangian with respect to $x$:\n$$\\nabla_{xx}^2 L(x, \\lambda) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial x_1^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial x_1 \\partial x_2} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial x_2 \\partial x_1} & \\frac{\\partial^2 L}{\\partial x_2^2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 12x_2^2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nWe evaluate this Hessian at the point $(x^\\star, \\lambda^\\star) = ((0,0), 0)$:\n$$\\nabla_{xx}^2 L(x^\\star, \\lambda^\\star) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 12(0)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe second-order conditions involve evaluating the curvature $d^T \\nabla_{xx}^2 L(x^\\star, \\lambda^\\star) d$ for directions $d$ in the tangent space $T(x^\\star)$. Let $d = (0, d_2) \\in T(x^\\star)$.\n$$d^T \\nabla_{xx}^2 L(x^\\star, \\lambda^\\star) d = (0, d_2) \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ d_2 \\end{pmatrix} = (0, d_2) \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 0$$\n\n-   **Second-Order Necessary Condition (SONC):** For $x^\\star$ to be a local minimizer, we must have $d^T \\nabla_{xx}^2 L(x^\\star, \\lambda^\\star) d \\ge 0$ for all $d \\in T(x^\\star)$. Since the value is $0$ for all $d \\in T(x^\\star)$, and $0 \\ge 0$, the SONC is satisfied.\n-   **Second-Order Sufficient Condition (SOSC):** If $d^T \\nabla_{xx}^2 L(x^\\star, \\lambda^\\star) d > 0$ for all non-zero $d \\in T(x^\\star)$, then $x^\\star$ is a strict local minimizer. In our case, for any non-zero vector in the tangent space, e.g., $d=(0,1)$, the curvature is $0$. Since $0$ is not strictly greater than $0$, the SOSC does not hold. The test is inconclusive.\n\n**3. Direct Analysis of the Minimum**\n\nWhen the standard second-order tests are inconclusive, we can analyze the problem more directly. The constraint $x_1 = 0$ confines the problem to the $x_2$-axis. By substituting the constraint into the objective function, the problem becomes:\nMinimize $g(x_2) = f(0, x_2) = 0^2 + x_2^4 = x_2^4$.\nThe point $x^\\star = (0,0)$ corresponds to $x_2=0$ in this reduced, unconstrained problem. The value of the function at this point is $g(0) = 0^4 = 0$.\nFor any other feasible point, which has the form $(0, x_2)$ with $x_2 \\neq 0$, the function value is:\n$$f(0, x_2) = x_2^4 > 0 = f(0,0)$$\nThis inequality shows that any feasible point in any neighborhood of $(0,0)$, other than $(0,0)$ itself, has a strictly greater function value. Therefore, $x^\\star = (0,0)$ is a strict local minimizer (and also a strict global minimizer) of the constrained problem.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The point $x^\\star$ is feasible and satisfies the first-order necessary condition with Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda^\\star = 0$.**\nAs shown in our analysis, $x^\\star=(0,0)$ is feasible as $h(0,0)=0$. The stationary condition $\\nabla_x L(0,0, \\lambda) = (\\lambda, 0) = (0,0)$ is satisfied for $\\lambda=0$. Thus, $x^\\star$ satisfies the first-order necessary condition with $\\lambda^\\star = 0$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The second-order sufficient condition for a strict local minimum holds at $x^\\star$ because the Hessian of the Lagrangian is positive semidefinite on the tangent space.**\nThe second-order sufficient condition requires the Hessian of the Lagrangian to be *positive definite* on the tangent space (i.e., $d^T H d > 0$ for all $d \\in T(x^\\star), d \\neq 0$), not merely positive semidefinite ($d^T H d \\ge 0$). We found that for any non-zero $d \\in T(x^\\star)$, $d^T \\nabla_{xx}^2 L d = 0$, which violates the positive definite requirement. Therefore, the SOSC does not hold. The premise of the statement is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Even though the second-order sufficient condition does not hold, the point $x^\\star$ is a strict local minimizer of the constrained problem.**\nOur analysis confirmed that the SOSC does not hold, making the test inconclusive. However, by substituting the constraint into the objective function, we proved that $x^\\star = (0,0)$ is indeed a strict local minimizer. Both clauses of the statement are true.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. The second-order necessary condition fails at $x^\\star$ because the Hessian of the Lagrangian is zero along the tangent space direction.**\nThe second-order necessary condition (SONC) requires $d^T \\nabla_{xx}^2 L d \\ge 0$ for all $d$ in the tangent space. We calculated this value to be exactly $0$. Since $0 \\ge 0$ is true, the SONC is satisfied. It does not fail.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. There exists $\\varepsilon > 0$ such that any feasible point $(x_1,x_2)$ with $\\|(x_1,x_2)\\| < \\varepsilon$ and $(x_1,x_2) \\neq (0,0)$ satisfies $f(x_1,x_2) > f(0,0)$.**\nThis statement is the formal definition of a strict local minimizer for a constrained problem. A feasible point must satisfy $x_1=0$. Let such a point be $x=(0, x_2)$. The condition $\\|x\\| = \\sqrt{0^2 + x_2^2} = |x_2| < \\varepsilon$ combined with $x \\neq (0,0)$ means $0 < |x_2| < \\varepsilon$. For such points, we evaluate the inequality:\n$$f(0, x_2) > f(0,0)$$\n$$x_2^4 > 0^2 + 0^4$$\n$$x_2^4 > 0$$\nThis is true for any $x_2 \\neq 0$. Therefore, the condition holds for any choice of $\\varepsilon > 0$. Since we established that $x^\\star$ is a strict local minimizer, this definitional statement must be true.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "3176305"}]}
