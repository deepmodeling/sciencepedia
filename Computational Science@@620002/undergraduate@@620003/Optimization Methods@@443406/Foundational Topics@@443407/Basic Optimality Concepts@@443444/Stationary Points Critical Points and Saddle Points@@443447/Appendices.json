Find the Stationary Point**\nA stationary point $(x_0, y_0)$ is a point where the gradient of the function is the zero vector, i.e., $\\nabla f(x_0, y_0) = \\mathbf{0}$. The gradient of $f$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla f(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x+y \\\\ x-2y \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSetting the gradient to zero gives the following system of linear equations:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n2x+y = 0 \\\\\nx-2y = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFrom the second equation, we have $x=2y$. Substituting this into the first equation:\n$$\n2(2y)+y=0 \\implies 4y+y=0 \\implies 5y=0 \\implies y=0\n$$\nSubstituting $y=0$ back into $x=2y$ gives $x=0$.\nThus, the only stationary point is $(0,0)$.\n\n**2. Classify the Stationary Point using the Hessian Matrix**\nThe Hessian matrix $H$ is the matrix of second partial derivatives:\n$$\nH(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe second partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(2x+y) = 2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(2x+y) = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x-2y) = -2\n$$\nSince $f$ is twice continuously differentiable, $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 1$. The Hessian matrix is constant for all $(x,y)$:\n$$\nH = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo classify the stationary point $(0,0)$, we analyze the definiteness of $H$. We do this by finding its eigenvalues, which are the principal curvatures. The characteristic equation is $\\det(H-\\lambda I)=0$:\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 2-\\lambda & 1 \\\\ 1 & -2-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\n$$\n(2-\\lambda)(-2-\\lambda) - (1)(1) = 0\n$$\n$$\n-4-2\\lambda+2\\lambda+\\lambda^2 - 1 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda^2 - 5 = 0 \\implies \\lambda = \\pm\\sqrt{5}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues (principal curvatures) are $\\lambda_1 = \\sqrt{5}$ and $\\lambda_2 = -\\sqrt{5}$. Since one eigenvalue is positive and the other is negative, the Hessian matrix is indefinite. A stationary point with an indefinite Hessian is a saddle point.\n\n**3. Determine the Rotation to Diagonalize the Hessian**\nWe seek an orthogonal rotation matrix $R(\\varphi) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\varphi & -\\sin\\varphi \\\\ \\sin\\varphi & \\cos\\varphi \\end{pmatrix}$ that diagonalizes $H$. The columns of $R(\\varphi)$ must be the normalized eigenvectors of $H$. The transformation is given by $D = R(\\varphi)^\\top H R(\\varphi)$, where $D$ is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.\nThe angle of rotation $\\varphi$ that aligns the coordinate axes with the principal axes of the quadratic form $Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2$ is given by $\\tan(2\\varphi) = \\frac{B}{A-C}$. The quadratic form associated with the Hessian $H = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ b & c \\end{pmatrix}$ is $q(x,y) = ax^2 + 2bxy + cy^2$. For our Hessian $H = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$, we have $a=2$, $b=1$, $c=-2$. The formula for the rotation angle to diagonalize the matrix itself is $\\tan(2\\varphi)=\\frac{2b}{a-c}$.\n$$\n\\tan(2\\varphi) = \\frac{2(1)}{2 - (-2)} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nWe can solve for $\\varphi$. Let us choose $2\\varphi$ to be in the first quadrant, so $\\varphi$ is in $(0, \\pi/4)$. We use the half-angle identity for tangent: $\\tan(2\\varphi) = \\frac{2\\tan\\varphi}{1-\\tan^2\\varphi}$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2\\tan\\varphi}{1-\\tan^2\\varphi}\n$$\n$$\n1-\\tan^2\\varphi = 4\\tan\\varphi\n$$\n$$\n\\tan^2\\varphi + 4\\tan\\varphi - 1 = 0\n$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $\\tan\\varphi$. Using the quadratic formula:\n$$\n\\tan\\varphi = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{4^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16+4}}{2} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2} = \\frac{-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{5}}{2} = -2 \\pm \\sqrt{5}\n$$\nSince we chose $\\varphi \\in (0, \\pi/4)$, $\\tan\\varphi$ must be positive and less than $1$.\nThe value $\\sqrt{5}-2 \\approx 2.236-2=0.236$ satisfies $0 < \\sqrt{5}-2 < 1$.\nThe other value, $-2-\\sqrt{5}$, is negative.\nThus, we must have $\\tan\\varphi = \\sqrt{5}-2$. The rotation angle is $\\varphi = \\arctan(\\sqrt{5}-2)$.\n\n**4. Express Quadratic Form in Rotated Coordinates**\nThe coordinate transformation is given by $\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = R(\\varphi)\\begin{pmatrix} u \\\\ v \\end{pmatrix}$. The quadratic part of the function is the function itself, $f(x,y)=x^2+xy-y^2$. This corresponds to the matrix $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1/2 \\\\ 1/2 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Note that $H=2A$. The quadratic form is $\\mathbf{x}^\\top A \\mathbf{x}$.\nIn the new coordinates $(u,v)$, the quadratic form becomes:\n$$\nf(u,v) = \\left(R(\\varphi)\\begin{pmatrix} u \\\\ v \\end{pmatrix}\\right)^\\top A \\left(R(\\varphi)\\begin{pmatrix} u \\\\ v \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = \\begin{pmatrix} u \\\\ v \\end{pmatrix}^\\top (R(\\varphi)^\\top A R(\\varphi)) \\begin{pmatrix} u \\\\ v \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe matrix $R(\\varphi)^\\top A R(\\varphi)$ is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are the eigenvalues of $A$. The eigenvalues of $A = \\frac{1}{2}H$ are half the eigenvalues of $H$, which are $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ and $-\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\nThus, in the rotated coordinate system, the function is:\n$$\nf(u,v) = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}u^2 - \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}v^2\n$$\nThis form explicitly shows the saddle nature of the function at the origin, with parabolic curvature upwards along the $u$-axis and downwards along the $v$-axis. There is no cross term $uv$.\n\n**Summary of Results**\n- The stationary point is $(0,0)$, which is a saddle point.\n- The principal curvatures are the eigenvalues of the Hessian, which are $\\lambda_{\\text{max}} = \\sqrt{5}$ and $\\lambda_{\\text{min}} = -\\sqrt{5}$.\n- The rotation angle required to diagonalize the Hessian is $\\varphi = \\arctan(\\sqrt{5}-2)$ radians.\n\nThe final answer requires a single row matrix containing the rotation angle $\\varphi$, the larger principal curvature, and the smaller principal curvature, in that order.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\varphi & \\lambda_{\\text{max}} & \\lambda_{\\text{min}} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\arctan(\\sqrt{5}-2) & \\sqrt{5} & -\\sqrt{5} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\arctan(\\sqrt{5}-2) & \\sqrt{5} & -\\sqrt{5} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3184889"}, {"introduction": "The second-derivative test is a powerful tool, but what happens when it yields an inconclusive result?

In all cases on $\\mathcal{C}$ the Hessian is rank-deficient, so the classical second-order test is inconclusive: a positive semidefinite Hessian does not guarantee a local minimum, a negative semidefinite Hessian does not guarantee a local maximum, and a singular Hessian cannot certify a saddle without further analysis.\n\nStep $3$: Classify nonzero critical points $(0,y_{0})$ with $y_{0}\\neq 0$. Fix $y_{0}>0$. Consider any sufficiently small neighborhood of $(0,y_{0})$ in which $y>0$ is maintained, for instance any ball of radius $r$ with $r<y_{0}$. In such a neighborhood, $f(x,y)=x^{2}y\\ge 0$ with equality if and only if $x=0$. Since $f(0,y_{0})=0$, it follows that $(0,y_{0})$ is a local minimum, but not strict, because $f(0,y)=0$ for all $y$ in the neighborhood along the line $x=0$. Similarly, for $y_{0}<0$, in a sufficiently small neighborhood one has $y<0$, so $f(x,y)=x^{2}y\\le 0$, with equality along $x=0$, implying that $(0,y_{0})$ is a local maximum, again non-strict.\n\nStep $4$: Classify the origin using directional tests beyond second order.

The leading-order term in $t$ is of order $t^{3}$, and its directional coefficient is the cubic form\n$$\ng(u_{x},u_{y})=u_{x}^{2}\\,u_{y}.\n$$\nBecause there exist unit directions with $g(u_{x},u_{y})>0$ (for example, $u_{x}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, $u_{y}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$) and also unit directions with $g(u_{x},u_{y})<0$ (for example, $u_{x}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, $u_{y}=-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$), it follows that in every neighborhood of the origin there are points where $f>0$ and points where $f<0$. Therefore, the origin is a saddle point. This conclusion illustrates precisely how the rank-deficiency of the Hessian complicates classification: the vanishing quadratic form forces us to appeal to higher-order (here cubic) directional behavior to detect the change of sign that certifies a saddle.\n\nSummary of classifications:\n- For $(0,y_{0})$ with $y_{0}>0$: local (non-strict) minimum.\n- For $(0,y_{0})$ with $y_{0}<0$: local (non-strict) maximum.\n- For $(0,0)$: saddle point, detected via the directional cubic profile $g(u_{x},u_{y})$.\n\nPer the problem’s reporting requirement, the analytic expression for the leading-order directional profile is $g(u_{x},u_{y})=u_{x}^{2}u_{y}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{u_{x}^{2}u_{y}}$$", "id": "3184903"}, {"introduction": "Most real-world optimization problems involve constraints, which fundamentally changes how we locate and analyze stationary points.

We will use the method of Lagrange multipliers.\n\nFirst, we define the Lagrangian function $L(x_1, x_2, \\lambda)$, which combines the objective function and the constraint:\n$$L(x_1, x_2, \\lambda) = f(x_1, x_2) - \\lambda g(x_1, x_2) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 - \\lambda(x_1x_2 - 1)$$\nThe Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions for a stationary point state that the gradient of the Lagrangian must be zero.
