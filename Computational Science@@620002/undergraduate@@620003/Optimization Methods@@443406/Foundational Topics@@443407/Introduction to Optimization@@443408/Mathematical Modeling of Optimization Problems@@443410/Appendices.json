There are $3$ students, indexed by $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$, and $4$ sections, indexed by $j \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$. The sections occur at these times: section $1$ from $09:00$ to $09:50$, section $2$ from $09:30$ to $10:20$, section $3$ from $10:20$ to $11:10$, and section $4$ from $11:00$ to $11:50$. Two sections that overlap in time cannot be attended by the same student simultaneously. Based on the times given, the pairs of overlapping sections are $(1,2)$, $(2,3)$, and $(3,4)$.\n\nEach student $i$ can enroll in at most $2$ sections in total over the morning.

No rounding is necessary.", "solution": "The problem asks for two parts: first, to formulate an Integer Linear Program (ILP) for a student scheduling problem, and second, to solve the specific instance provided to find the maximum total preference value.\n\nFirst, we formulate the ILP. Let $x_{ij}$ be the binary decision variable such that $x_{ij} = 1$ if student $i$ is assigned to section $j$, and $x_{ij} = 0$ otherwise. The indices are $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ for the students and $j \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ for the sections. The preference weight of student $i$ for section $j$ is denoted by $w_{ij}$.\n\nThe objective is to maximize the sum of preference weights for all assignments made. This is expressed by the objective function $Z$:\n$$ \\text{Maximize } Z = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\sum_{j=1}^{4} w_{ij} x_{ij} $$\n\nThis maximization is subject to several constraints based on the problem description.\n\n1.  **Binary Decision Variables**: The variables $x_{ij}$ must be binary, as a student is either assigned to a section or not.\n    $$ x_{ij} \\in \\{0, 1\\} \\quad \\forall i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}, \\; \\forall j \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} $$\n\n2.  **Student Enrollment Limit**: Each student can enroll in at most $2$ sections.

The problem states the overlapping pairs are $(1,2)$, $(2,3)$, and $(3,4)$. For any student $i$, they can be assigned to at most one section from each pair. This is modeled as:\n    $$ x_{i1} + x_{i2} \\le 1 \\quad \\text{for each } i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $$\n    $$ x_{i2} + x_{i3} \\le 1 \\quad \\text{for each } i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $$\n    $$ x_{i3} + x_{i4} \\le 1 \\quad \\text{for each } i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $$\nThis completes the formulation of the ILP.\n\nNext, we solve the specific instance to find the optimal total preference value. The total number of available slots in all sections is the sum of their capacities: $C_1+C_2+C_3+C_4 = 1+1+2+1 = 5$. The total number of enrollments is also limited by the number of students and their individual limits, which is at most $3 \\times 2 = 6$. The more restrictive limit is the total capacity, so a maximum of $5$ assignments ($x_{ij}=1$) can be made.\n\nAn upper bound on the objective function's value can be established by summing the $5$ highest preference weights.

Their sum gives an upper bound on the total preference value:\n$$ Z_{\\text{upper bound}} = 9 + 9 + 8 + 8 + 7 = 41 $$\nIf a feasible assignment exists that corresponds to these five weights, it must be an optimal solution.

This satisfies the $\\le 2$ limit.\n    - Student $2$: assigned to sections $2$ and $4$, for a total of $2$ sections. This satisfies the $\\le 2$ limit.\n    - Student $3$: assigned to section $3$, for a total of $1$ section. This satisfies the $\\le 2$ limit.\n\n2.  **Section Capacity Constraints**:\n    - Section $1$ ($C_1=1$): one student ($1$) is assigned. This satisfies the capacity.\n    - Section $2$ ($C_2=1$): one student ($2$) is assigned. This satisfies the capacity.\n    - Section $3$ ($C_3=2$): two students ($1$ and $3$) are assigned. This satisfies the capacity.\n    - Section $4$ ($C_4=1$): one student ($2$) is assigned. This satisfies the capacity.\n\n3.  **Conflict Constraints**:\n    - Student $1$ (Sections $1, 3$): Sections $1$ and $3$ do not overlap. The formal constraints are checked: $x_{11}+x_{12} = 1+0 = 1 \\le 1$; $x_{12}+x_{13} = 0+1 = 1 \\le 1$; $x_{13}+x_{14} = 1+0 = 1 \\le 1$.

All are satisfied.\n    - Student $3$ (Section $3$): Only one section is assigned, so no conflict is possible. All conflict constraints for student $3$ are trivially satisfied.\n\nThe proposed assignment is feasible as it satisfies all problem constraints. The value of the objective function for this assignment is the sum of the top $5$ weights, which is $41$. Since we found a feasible solution that achieves the calculated upper bound, this solution is optimal.\n\nThus, the optimal total preference value is $41$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{41}\n$$", "id": "3147876"}, {"introduction": "After exploring discrete decisions, we now turn to problems involving continuous quantities, such as allocating weights or resources.

Since we are minimizing and $\\mu_i$ must be non-negative, we can set $\\mu_i = \\max(0, d_i x_i - \\lambda)$. To model this in a linear fashion, we introduce variables $z_i$ such that $z_i \\ge 0$ and $z_i \\ge d_i x_i - \\lambda$. The minimization will ensure $z_i$ takes on the value $\\max(0, d_i x_i - \\lambda)$.\n\nThe robust capacity constraint is thus equivalent to the following system of linear inequalities involving the original variables $x_i$ and auxiliary continuous variables $\\lambda$ and $z_i$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\underline{w}_i x_i + \\Gamma \\lambda + \\sum_{i=1}^{5} z_i \\le W $$\n$$ z_i \\ge d_i x_i - \\lambda, \\quad \\forall i \\in \\{1, \\dots, 5\\} $$\n$$ z_i \\ge 0, \\quad \\forall i \\in \\{1, \\dots, 5\\} $$\n$$ \\lambda \\ge 0 $$\nThis set of constraints is the robust capacity constraint derived from first principles.\n\n### Task 3: Optimal Value for $\\Gamma=2$\n\nWe need to solve the following mixed-integer linear program (MILP):\n$$ \\text{Maximize} \\quad Z = 12x_1 + 10x_2 + 14x_3 + 16x_4 + 7x_5 $$\nSubject to:\n$$ x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}, \\quad \\forall i \\in \\{1, \\dots, 5\\} $$\nand the robust capacity constraint from Task 2, with given data:\n- $v = (12, 10, 14, 16, 7)$\n- $\\underline{w} = (3, 4, 2, 5, 1)$\n- $\\overline{w} = (5, 4.5, 6, 7, 3)$\n- $d = \\overline{w} - \\underline{w} = (2, 0.5, 4, 2, 2)$\n- $W = 15$ and $\\Gamma = 2$\n\nFor a small problem with $2^5=32$ possible selections, we can find the optimal solution by evaluating the most promising combinations. For any given selection $x$, the robust weight is $\\sum_i \\underline{w}_i x_i + R(x)$, where $R(x)$ is the protection cost. Since $\\Gamma=2$ is an integer, $R(x)$ is the sum of the two largest deviations $\\{d_i\\}$ for which $x_i=1$. If one or zero packages are selected, it is the sum of all their deviations.\n\nLet's test key combinations:\n\n1.  **Selection {3, 4, 5}**: $x=(0,0,1,1,1)$\n    - Value: $v_3+v_4+v_5 = 14+16+7 = 37$.\n    - Nominal weight: $\\underline{w}_3+\\underline{w}_4+\\underline{w}_5 = 2+5+1 = 8$.\n    - Selected deviations: $\\{d_3, d_4, d_5\\} = \\{4, 2, 2\\}$.\n    - Protection cost (sum of 2 largest): $4+2=6$.\n    - Robust weight: $8+6 = 14$.\n    - Feasibility: $14 \\le 15$. This solution is feasible.\n\n2.  **Selection {1, 2, 3}**: $x=(1,1,1,0,0)$\n    - Value: $v_1+v_2+v_3 = 12+10+14=36$.\n    - Nominal weight: $\\underline{w}_1+\\underline{w}_2+\\underline{w}_3 = 3+4+2=9$.\n    - Selected deviations: $\\{d_1, d_2, d_3\\} = \\{2, 0.5, 4\\}$.\n    - Protection cost (sum of 2 largest): $4+2=6$.\n    - Robust weight: $9+6=15$.\n    - Feasibility: $15 \\le 15$. This solution is feasible.\n\n3.  **Selection {1, 4, 5}**: $x=(1,0,0,1,1)$\n    - Value: $v_1+v_4+v_5 = 12+16+7=35$.\n    - Nominal weight: $\\underline{w}_1+\\underline{w}_4+\\underline{w}_5 = 3+5+1=9$.\n    - Selected deviations: $\\{d_1, d_4, d_5\\} = \\{2, 2, 2\\}$.\n    - Protection cost (sum of 2 largest): $2+2=4$.\n    - Robust weight: $9+4=13$.\n    - Feasibility: $13 \\le 15$. This solution is feasible.\n\n4.  **Selection {1, 3, 4}**: $x=(1,0,1,1,0)$\n    - Value: $v_1+v_3+v_4 = 12+14+16=42$.\n    - Nominal weight: $\\underline{w}_1+\\underline{w}_3+\\underline{w}_4 = 3+2+5=10$.\n    - Selected deviations: $\\{d_1, d_3, d_4\\} = \\{2, 4, 2\\}$.\n    - Protection cost (sum of 2 largest): $4+2=6$.\n    - Robust weight: $10+6=16$.\n    - Feasibility: $16 \\le 15$. This solution is infeasible.\n\nSystematic exploration shows that any combination of 4 or 5 packages is infeasible. For example, the combination with the lowest nominal weight among 4-package sets is {1, 2, 3, 5}, with nominal weight $3+4+2+1=10$. The deviations are $\\{2, 0.5, 4, 2\\}$, so the protection cost is $4+2=6$. The robust weight is $10+6=16$, which exceeds the capacity of $15$.\n\nComparing the values of all feasible solutions, the maximum value obtained is from the selection {3, 4, 5}.\n\nThe maximum obtainable total value is $37$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{37}$$", "id": "3147927"}]}
