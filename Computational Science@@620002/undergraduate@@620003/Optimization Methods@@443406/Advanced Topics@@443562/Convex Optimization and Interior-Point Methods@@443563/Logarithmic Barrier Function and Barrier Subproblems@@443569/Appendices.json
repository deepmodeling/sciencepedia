All provided information is consistent and sufficient for deriving a unique solution. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe task is to analyze a logarithmic barrier subproblem for a given linear program. The original constrained problem is:\n$$\n\\text{minimize } f(x,y) = x + y \\\\\n\\text{subject to } x \\geq 0, y \\geq 0, x + y \\leq 1\n$$\nThe barrier subproblem for a parameter $\\mu > 0$ is to minimize the function:\n$$\nF_{\\mu}(x,y) = x + y - \\mu\\left(\\ln x + \\ln y + \\ln(1 - x - y)\\right)\n$$\nover the open convex set $\\mathcal{D} = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : x > 0, y > 0, x + y < 1\\}$.\n\nFirst, we establish that $F_{\\mu}(x,y)$ is strictly convex on its domain $\\mathcal{D}$. The function $F_{\\mu}(x,y)$ is a sum of four component functions: $f_0(x,y) = x+y$, $f_1(x) = -\\mu \\ln x$, $f_2(y) = -\\mu \\ln y$, and $f_3(x,y) = -\\mu \\ln(1-x-y)$.\n1.  The function $f_0(x,y) = x+y$ is linear, and is therefore convex.\n2.  The function $f_1(x) = -\\mu \\ln x$ is a function of $x$ alone. Its second derivative is $f_1''(x) = \\frac{\\mu}{x^2}$. Since $\\mu > 0$ and $x > 0$ on $\\mathcal{D}$, we have $f_1''(x) > 0$. Thus, $f_1(x)$ is a strictly convex function of $x$. As a function of $(x,y)$, it is strictly convex.\n3.  Similarly, $f_2(y) = -\\mu \\ln y$ is a strictly convex function of $y$, and hence a strictly convex function of $(x,y)$.\n4.  The function $f_3(x,y) = -\\mu \\ln(1-x-y)$ is the composition of the convex function $h(z) = -\\mu \\ln z$ and the affine mapping $g(x,y) = 1-x-y$. A composition of a convex function with an affine mapping is convex.\nThe function $F_{\\mu}(x,y)$ is the sum of these four functions. The sum of several convex functions and at least one strictly convex function is strictly convex. Since $F_{\\mu}(x,y)$ includes the strictly convex functions $f_1(x)$ and $f_2(y)$, it is strictly convex on the convex domain $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\nA strictly convex function over a convex domain has at most one minimizer. Since $F_{\\mu}(x,y)$ is differentiable, its unique minimizer $(x_{\\mu}, y_{\\mu})$ must satisfy the first-order optimality condition, where the gradient vanishes: $\\nabla F_{\\mu}(x,y) = 0$.\nThe partial derivatives of $F_{\\mu}(x,y)$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F_{\\mu}}{\\partial x} = 1 - \\frac{\\mu}{x} + \\frac{\\mu}{1 - x - y}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F_{\\mu}}{\\partial y} = 1 - \\frac{\\mu}{y} + \\frac{\\mu}{1 - x - y}\n$$\nSetting the gradient to zero gives the system of equations:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{\\mu}{x} + \\frac{\\mu}{1 - x - y} = 0 \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n1 - \\frac{\\mu}{y} + \\frac{\\mu}{1 - x - y} = 0 \\quad (2)\n$$\nSubtracting equation $(2)$ from $(1)$ gives:\n$$\n\\left(1 - \\frac{\\mu}{x}\\right) - \\left(1 - \\frac{\\mu}{y}\\right) = 0 \\implies -\\frac{\\mu}{x} + \\frac{\\mu}{y} = 0\n$$\nSince $\\mu > 0$, this implies $\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{1}{y}$, which means $x = y$. This is expected from the symmetry of the problem. Substituting $y=x$ into equation $(1)$:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{\\mu}{x} + \\frac{\\mu}{1 - 2x} = 0\n$$\nTo solve for $x$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$\n1 = \\frac{\\mu}{x} - \\frac{\\mu}{1 - 2x} = \\frac{\\mu(1 - 2x) - \\mu x}{x(1 - 2x)} = \\frac{\\mu(1 - 3x)}{x(1 - 2x)}\n$$\nThis leads to the quadratic equation:\n$$\nx(1 - 2x) = \\mu(1 - 3x) \\implies x - 2x^2 = \\mu - 3\\mu x\n$$\n$$\n2x^2 - (1 + 3\\mu)x + \\mu = 0\n$$\nUsing the quadratic formula, the solutions for $x$ are:\n$$\nx = \\frac{(1 + 3\\mu) \\pm \\sqrt{(1 + 3\\mu)^2 - 4(2)\\mu}}{2(2)} = \\frac{1 + 3\\mu \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 6\\mu + 9\\mu^2 - 8\\mu}}{4} = \\frac{1 + 3\\mu \\pm \\sqrt{9\\mu^2 - 2\\mu + 1}}{4}\n$$\nThe domain $\\mathcal{D}$ requires $x > 0$, $y > 0$, and $x+y < 1$. With $x=y$, this simplifies to $x > 0$ and $2x < 1$, i.e., $0 < x < \\frac{1}{2}$. We must select the root that lies in this interval.\nLet's analyze the two roots. For $\\mu > 0$, we have $\\sqrt{9\\mu^2 - 2\\mu + 1} > \\sqrt{9\\mu^2 - 6\\mu + 1} = \\sqrt{(3\\mu-1)^2} = |3\\mu-1|$. For $\\mu \\in (0, 1/3)$, this is $1-3\\mu$.\nThe root with the plus sign is $x_+ = \\frac{1 + 3\\mu + \\sqrt{9\\mu^2 - 2\\mu + 1}}{4}$. For $\\mu \\in (0, 1/3)$, $x_+ > \\frac{1+3\\mu + (1-3\\mu)}{4} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$. This root is outside the required interval.\nThe root with the minus sign is $x_- = \\frac{1 + 3\\mu - \\sqrt{9\\mu^2 - 2\\mu + 1}}{4}$. We check its bounds. Since $1+3\\mu > \\sqrt{(1+3\\mu)^2} = \\sqrt{9\\mu^2+6\\mu+1} > \\sqrt{9\\mu^2-2\\mu+1}$ for $\\mu>0$, the numerator is positive, so $x_->0$. As established, $x_-$ is also less than $1/2$. Thus, this is the correct solution.\nSo, the unique minimizer is $(x_{\\mu}, y_{\\mu})$ where $x_{\\mu} = y_{\\mu} = \\frac{1 + 3\\mu - \\sqrt{9\\mu^2 - 2\\mu + 1}}{4}$.\nTo obtain a more convenient form, we can rationalize the numerator:\n$$\nx_{\\mu} = \\frac{(1 + 3\\mu - \\sqrt{9\\mu^2 - 2\\mu + 1})(1 + 3\\mu + \\sqrt{9\\mu^2 - 2\\mu + 1})}{4(1 + 3\\mu + \\sqrt{9\\mu^2 - 2\\mu + 1})}\n$$\n$$\nx_{\\mu} = \\frac{(1+3\\mu)^2 - (9\\mu^2 - 2\\mu + 1)}{4(1 + 3\\mu + \\sqrt{9\\mu^2 - 2\\mu + 1})} = \\frac{1+6\\mu+9\\mu^2 - 9\\mu^2 + 2\\mu - 1}{4(1 + 3\\mu + \\sqrt{9\\mu^2 - 2\\mu + 1})}\n$$\n$$\nx_{\\mu} = \\frac{8\\mu}{4(1 + 3\\mu + \\sqrt{9\\mu^2 - 2\\mu + 1})} = \\frac{2\\mu}{1 + 3\\mu + \\sqrt{9\\mu^2 - 2\\mu + 1}}\n$$\nThus, the unique minimizer is $(x_{\\mu}, y_{\\mu})$ with $x_{\\mu} = y_{\\mu} = \\frac{2\\mu}{1 + 3\\mu + \\sqrt{9\\mu^2 - 2\\mu + 1}}$.\n\nFinally, we find the optimum of the original problem and verify the limit. The original problem is to minimize $f(x,y)=x+y$ over the feasible set, which is a triangle with vertices $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(0,1)$. Since $x \\geq 0$ and $y \\geq 0$, the minimum value of $x+y$ is $0$, which is achieved uniquely at the point $(x^{\\star}, y^{\\star}) = (0,0)$.\nNow we take the limit of our solution as $\\mu \\to 0^+$:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\mu \\to 0^+} x_{\\mu} = \\lim_{\\mu \\to 0^+} \\frac{2\\mu}{1 + 3\\mu + \\sqrt{9\\mu^2 - 2\\mu + 1}} = \\frac{2(0)}{1 + 3(0) + \\sqrt{9(0)^2 - 2(0) + 1}} = \\frac{0}{1+1} = 0\n$$\nSince $y_{\\mu} = x_{\\mu}$, we also have $\\lim_{\\mu \\to 0^+} y_{\\mu} = 0$. Therefore, $\\lim_{\\mu \\to 0^+} (x_{\\mu}, y_{\\mu}) = (0,0) = (x^{\\star}, y^{\\star})$, which verifies that the central path converges to the optimal solution of the original problem.\n\nThe problem asks for the closed-form expression for the unique minimizer $(x_{\\mu}, y_{\\mu})$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2\\mu}{1 + 3\\mu + \\sqrt{9\\mu^2 - 2\\mu + 1}} & \\frac{2\\mu}{1 + 3\\mu + \\sqrt{9\\mu^2 - 2\\mu + 1}} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3145963"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how the central path is defined, we now turn to a practical question: how does an algorithm follow this path without leaving the feasible region?

It does not violate any scientific principles, is mathematically formalizable, and is objective.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Maximal Feasible Step Bound $\\alpha^{\\star}$**\n\nThe condition for the updated point $x^{+} = x + \\alpha \\Delta x$ to remain strictly feasible is that for every constraint $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}$, the inequality $b_i - a_i^{\\top} x^{+} > 0$ must hold. For $\\alpha > 0$, we have:\n$$b_i - a_i^{\\top}(x + \\alpha \\Delta x) > 0$$\nBy linearity of the dot product, this can be expanded to:\n$$b_i - a_i^{\\top}x - \\alpha (a_i^{\\top} \\Delta x) > 0$$\nLet $s_i(x) = b_i - a_i^{\\top}x$ denote the slack for the $i$-th constraint at the current point $x$. By the premise of an interior-point iteration, $s_i(x) > 0$ for all $i$. Substituting this definition, the inequality becomes:\n$$s_i(x) - \\alpha (a_i^{\\top} \\Delta x) > 0$$\nTo find the valid range for $\\alpha$, we analyze this inequality based on the sign of the term $a_i^{\\top} \\Delta x$.\n\nCase 1: $a_i^{\\top} \\Delta x \\leq 0$.\nIn this case, for any $\\alpha > 0$, the term $-\\alpha (a_i^{\\top} \\Delta x)$ is non-negative. Since $s_i(x) > 0$ by assumption, the inequality $s_i(x) - \\alpha (a_i^{\\top} \\Delta x) \\geq s_i(x) > 0$ is satisfied for all $\\alpha > 0$. This means that if the search direction $\\Delta x$ moves parallel to or away from the $i$-th constraint boundary, strict feasibility of that constraint is maintained for any positive step size. Thus, such a constraint imposes no upper bound on $\\alpha$.\n\nCase 2: $a_i^{\\top} \\Delta x > 0$.\nThis case corresponds to the search direction pointing towards the $i$-th constraint boundary. We can rearrange the inequality to solve for $\\alpha$:\n$$s_i(x) > \\alpha (a_i^{\\top} \\Delta x)$$\n$$\\alpha < \\frac{s_i(x)}{a_i^{\\top} \\Delta x}$$\nThis establishes an upper bound on $\\alpha$ for each constraint $i$ for which $a_i^{\\top} \\Delta x > 0$.\n\nTo ensure that the updated point $x^{+}$ is strictly feasible with respect to *all* constraints simultaneously, the step size $\\alpha$ must satisfy the most restrictive of these upper bounds. Therefore, $\\alpha$ must be strictly less than the minimum of all such ratios. The set of valid step sizes $\\alpha > 0$ is characterized by the interval $(0, \\alpha^{\\star})$, where $\\alpha^{\\star}$ is the supremum of this set. The supremum is given by:\n$$\\alpha^{\\star} = \\min_{i \\,:\\, a_i^{\\top} \\Delta x > 0} \\left\\{ \\frac{s_i(x)}{a_i^{\\top} \\Delta x} \\right\\} = \\min_{i \\,:\\, a_i^{\\top} \\Delta x > 0} \\left\\{ \\frac{b_i - a_i^{\\top} x}{a_i^{\\top} \\Delta x} \\right\\}$$\nIf the set $\\{i \\mid a_i^{\\top} \\Delta x > 0\\}$ is empty, then no constraint imposes an upper bound on $\\alpha$, and we define $\\alpha^{\\star} = +\\infty$.\n\n**Evaluation for the Concrete Data**\n\nWe now apply this formula to the provided data:\n- $x = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\Delta x = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- Constraints: $a_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, b_1 = 4$; $a_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, b_2 = 3$; $a_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, b_3 = 5$.\n\nFor each constraint $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, we calculate the numerator $b_i - a_i^{\\top}x$ and the denominator $a_i^{\\top} \\Delta x$.\n\nConstraint $i=1$:\n- Numerator: $b_1 - a_1^{\\top}x = 4 - \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = 4 - 1 = 3$.\n- Denominator: $a_1^{\\top} \\Delta x = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- Since the denominator is positive ($a_1^{\\top} \\Delta x = \\frac{1}{2} > 0$), this constraint imposes a bound.

This means I need to find the minimizer $x(\\mu)$ of $\\varphi_\\mu(x)$ by setting its gradient to zero.\n    *   First, write out the function $\\varphi_\\mu(x)$:\n        $$ \\varphi_\\mu(x) = c^\\top x - \\mu \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\log s_i(x) $$\n        $$ \\varphi_\\mu(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}^\\top \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{bmatrix} - \\mu \\left( \\log(x_1) + \\log(1-x_1) + \\log(x_2) + \\log(1-x_2) \\right) $$\n        $$ \\varphi_\\mu(x) = x_1 - \\mu \\log(x_1) - \\mu \\log(1-x_1) - \\mu \\log(x_2) - \\mu \\log(1-x_2) $$\n    *   Now, compute the gradient of $\\varphi_\\mu(x)$ with respect to $x = (x_1, x_2)$:\n        $$ \\nabla \\varphi_\\mu(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial \\varphi_\\mu}{\\partial x_1} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\varphi_\\mu}{\\partial x_2} \\end{bmatrix} $$\n        $$ \\frac{\\partial \\varphi_\\mu}{\\partial x_1} = 1 - \\mu \\frac{1}{x_1} - \\mu \\frac{-1}{1-x_1} = 1 - \\frac{\\mu}{x_1} + \\frac{\\mu}{1-x_1} $$\n        $$ \\frac{\\partial \\varphi_\\mu}{\\partial x_2} = 0 - \\mu \\frac{1}{x_2} - \\mu \\frac{-1}{1-x_2} = -\\frac{\\mu}{x_2} + \\frac{\\mu}{1-x_2} $$\n    *   Set the gradient to zero to find the first-order optimality conditions for $x(\\mu)$:\n        $$ \\nabla \\varphi_\\mu(x(\\mu)) = \\mathbf{0} $$\n        This gives a system of two equations for $x_1(\\mu)$ and $x_2(\\mu)$:\n        1.  $1 - \\frac{\\mu}{x_1(\\mu)} + \\frac{\\mu}{1-x_1(\\mu)} = 0$\n        2.  $-\\frac{\\mu}{x_2(\\mu)} + \\frac{\\mu}{1-x_2(\\mu)} = 0$\n    *   Solve the system of equations.\n        *   Let's start with equation (2). Since $\\mu > 0$, we can divide by $-\\mu$:\n            $$ \\frac{1}{x_2(\\mu)} - \\frac{1}{1-x_2(\\mu)} = 0 $$\n            $$ \\frac{1}{x_2(\\mu)} = \\frac{1}{1-x_2(\\mu)} $$\n            $$ 1 - x_2(\\mu) = x_2(\\mu) $$\n            $$ 1 = 2 x_2(\\mu) $$\n            $$ x_2(\\mu) = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n            This holds for all $\\mu > 0$. The $x_2$ component of the central path is constant. This makes physical sense: the objective function $c^\\top x = x_1$ has no dependence on $x_2$. The barrier function for $x_2$ is symmetric around $x_2 = 1/2$, namely $-\\mu(\\log(x_2) + \\log(1-x_2))$. The minimum of this symmetric barrier term is exactly at the center of the interval $[0,1]$, which is $1/2$. Since there is no \"pull\" from the objective function in the $x_2$ direction, the minimizer will be at the center of the interval for $x_2$.\n\n        *   Now solve equation (1) for $x_1(\\mu)$:\n            $$ 1 = \\frac{\\mu}{x_1(\\mu)} - \\frac{\\mu}{1-x_1(\\mu)} $$\n            $$ 1 = \\mu \\left( \\frac{(1-x_1(\\mu)) - x_1(\\mu)}{x_1(\\mu)(1-x_1(\\mu))} \\right) $$\n            $$ 1 = \\mu \\frac{1 - 2x_1(\\mu)}{x_1(\\mu) - x_1(\\mu)^2} $$\n            $$ x_1(\\mu) - x_1(\\mu)^2 = \\mu(1 - 2x_1(\\mu)) $$\n            $$ x_1(\\mu)^2 - x_1(\\mu) + \\mu(1 - 2x_1(\\mu)) = 0 $$\n            $$ x_1(\\mu)^2 + (-1 - 2\\mu) x_1(\\mu) + \\mu = 0 $$\n            This is a quadratic equation in $x_1(\\mu)$. Let's use the quadratic formula to solve for $x_1(\\mu)$:\n            $$ x_1(\\mu) = \\frac{-(-1-2\\mu) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1-2\\mu)^2 - 4(1)(\\mu)}}{2(1)} $$\n            $$ x_1(\\mu) = \\frac{1+2\\mu \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4\\mu + 4\\mu^2 - 4\\mu}}{2} $$\n            $$ x_1(\\mu) = \\frac{1+2\\mu \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4\\mu^2}}{2} $$\n            Since $x_1(\\mu)$ must be in the interval $(0, 1)$, we need to choose the correct sign.\n            Let's analyze the two possible solutions:\n            *   $x_1^{(+)} = \\frac{1+2\\mu + \\sqrt{1 + 4\\mu^2}}{2}$. For $\\mu > 0$, $\\sqrt{1+4\\mu^2} > \\sqrt{1} = 1$. So, $1+2\\mu+\\sqrt{1+4\\mu^2} > 1+2\\mu+1 = 2+2\\mu > 2$. Thus, $x_1^{(+)} > \\frac{2+2\\mu}{2} = 1+\\mu > 1$. This solution is outside the feasible region $\\operatorname{int}(\\mathcal{P})$.\n            *   $x_1^{(-)} = \\frac{1+2\\mu - \\sqrt{1 + 4\\mu^2}}{2}$. For $\\mu > 0$, we have $1 < \\sqrt{1+4\\mu^2}$. Also, $(1+2\\mu)^2 = 1+4\\mu+4\\mu^2 > 1+4\\mu^2$, which implies $\\sqrt{1+4\\mu^2} < 1+2\\mu$. Therefore, $1+2\\mu - (1+2\\mu) < 1+2\\mu - \\sqrt{1+4\\mu^2} < 1+2\\mu - 1$, which simplifies to $0 < 1+2\\mu - \\sqrt{1+4\\mu^2} < 2\\mu$. Dividing by $2$, we get $0 < x_1^{(-)} < \\mu$. Since $\\mu$ is typically small and we are interested in $\\mu \\to 0$, this solution is valid as it lies in $(0,1)$. Hence, this is the correct root.\n            $$ x_1(\\mu) = \\frac{1+2\\mu - \\sqrt{1 + 4\\mu^2}}{2} $$\n\n    *   Now, we determine the limit of the central path $x(\\mu) = (x_1(\\mu), x_2(\\mu))$ as $\\mu \\downarrow 0$.\n        *   We already established $x_2(\\mu) = 1/2$ for all $\\mu > 0$, so $\\lim_{\\mu \\downarrow 0} x_2(\\mu) = 1/2$.\n        *   For $x_1(\\mu)$, we take the limit:\n            $$ \\lim_{\\mu \\downarrow 0} x_1(\\mu) = \\lim_{\\mu \\downarrow 0} \\frac{1+2\\mu - \\sqrt{1 + 4\\mu^2}}{2} = \\frac{1+2(0) - \\sqrt{1 + 4(0)^2}}{2} = \\frac{1-1}{2} = 0 $$\n    *   Combining the results, the central path limit is:\n        $$ x^* = \\lim_{\\mu \\downarrow 0} x(\\mu) = \\left( \\lim_{\\mu \\downarrow 0} x_1(\\mu), \\lim_{\\mu \\downarrow 0} x_2(\\mu) \\right) = \\left(0, \\frac{1}{2}\\right) $$\n    *   This limit point $x^* = (0, 1/2)$ is not a vertex of the polytope $\\mathcal{P}$, whose vertices are $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, $(1,1)$, and $(0,1)$.\n    *   The optimal solution set for the original linear program $\\min \\{x_1 : 0 \\le x_1 \\le 1, 0 \\le x_2 \\le 1\\}$ is the set of points where $x_1$ achieves its minimum value of $0$. This set is the line segment $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : x_1 = 0, 0 \\le x_2 \\le 1\\}$, which is the left face of the unit square. This optimal set has dimension $1$, which is a case of non-unique optimal solutions.\n    *   The limit point of the central path, $(0, 1/2)$, is the analytic center of this optimal face. The analytic center of the 1D polytope $\\{x_2 : 0 \\le x_2 \\le 1\\}$ is the point that minimizes $-\\log(x_2)-\\log(1-x_2)$, which is $x_2=1/2$.\n    *   Now we examine the strict complementarity condition at the limit. The limit point pair $(x^*, y^*)$ must satisfy the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. The dual variables associated with the central path are $y_i(\\mu) = \\mu/s_i(x(\\mu))$. We find their limit as $\\mu \\downarrow 0$.\n        *   $x(\\mu) = (x_1(\\mu), 1/2)$, where $x_1(\\mu) \\approx \\mu$ for small $\\mu$.\n        *   $s_1(x(\\mu)) = x_1(\\mu) \\approx \\mu$.\n        *   $s_2(x(\\mu)) = 1-x_1(\\mu) \\approx 1-\\mu$.\n        *   $s_3(x(\\mu)) = x_2(\\mu) = 1/2$.\n        *   $s_4(x(\\mu)) = 1-x_2(\\mu) = 1/2$.\n        The limits of the dual variables are:\n        *   $y_1^* = \\lim_{\\mu \\downarrow 0} y_1(\\mu) = \\lim_{\\mu \\downarrow 0} \\frac{\\mu}{s_1(x(\\mu))} = \\lim_{\\mu \\downarrow 0} \\frac{\\mu}{\\mu - \\mu^2 + O(\\mu^3)} = 1$.\n        *   $y_2^* = \\lim_{\\mu \\downarrow 0} y_2(\\mu) = \\lim_{\\mu \\downarrow 0} \\frac{\\mu}{s_2(x(\\mu))} = \\lim_{\\mu \\downarrow 0} \\frac{\\mu}{1-\\mu} = 0$.\n        *   $y_3^* = \\lim_{\\mu \\downarrow 0} y_3(\\mu) = \\lim_{\\mu \\downarrow 0} \\frac{\\mu}{s_3(x(\\mu))} = \\lim_{\\mu \\downarrow 0} \\frac{\\mu}{1/2} = 0$.\n        *   $y_4^* = \\lim_{\\mu \\downarrow 0} y_4(\\mu) = \\lim_{\\mu \\downarrow 0} \\frac{\\mu}{s_4(x(\\mu))} = \\lim_{\\mu \\downarrow 0} \\frac{\\mu}{1/2} = 0$.\n        So the limit dual solution is $y^* = (1, 0, 0, 0)$. The slacks at the primal limit $x^*=(0,1/2)$ are $s(x^*) = (0, 1, 1/2, 1/2)$.\n        Strict complementarity requires that for each $i$, $y_i^* + s_i(x^*) > 0$.\n        *   $i=1: y_1^*+s_1(x^*) = 1+0=1 > 0$.\n        *   $i=2: y_2^*+s_2(x^*) = 0+1=1 > 0$.\n        *   $i=3: y_3^*+s_3(x^*) = 0+1/2=1/2 > 0$.\n        *   $i=4: y_4^*+s_4(x^*) = 0+1/2=1/2 > 0$.\n        Strict complementarity holds in the limit.\n\nEvaluation of Options:\nA. The central path satisfies $x_2(\\mu) = \\tfrac{1}{2}$ for all $\\mu > 0$ and $x_1(\\mu) \\to 0$ as $\\mu \\downarrow 0$, so $x(\\mu) \\to (0,\\tfrac{1}{2})$, the analytic center of the optimal face $\\{x \\in \\mathcal{P} : x_1 = 0\\}$. This non-vertex limit occurs because the optimal set has positive dimension (degeneracy in the sense of multiple optimal solutions), not because strict complementarity fails; in fact, strict complementarity holds in the limit.\n- **Verdict: Correct.** Our derivation confirms every part of this statement. The path converges to $(0, 1/2)$, which is the analytic center of the optimal face. The cause is the positive dimension of the optimal set. Our analysis also proved that strict complementarity holds.\n\nB. The central path converges to the vertex $(0,0)$ because the barrier promotes corner solutions and strict complementarity forces all active constraints to meet at a vertex.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.** The limit is $(0, 1/2)$, not $(0,0)$. The barrier function keeps solutions in the interior, it does not \"promote corner solutions\". Strict complementarity does not require solutions to be vertices, as demonstrated by this problem.\n\nC. The central path has no limit as $\\mu \\downarrow 0$ because the linear objective is not strictly convex, so the barrier subproblems do not define a convergent path.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.** The central path has a well-defined limit $(0, 1/2)$. The barrier subproblem objective function $\\varphi_\\mu(x)$ is strictly convex for any $\\mu > 0$ because the Hessian of the logarithmic barrier term is positive definite, ensuring a unique minimizer $x(\\mu)$ for each $\\mu > 0$ and thus a unique central path.\n\nD. The limit point of the central path depends on the starting point used by the numerical algorithm; different initializations produce different points on the optimal face.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.** The central path is a theoretical construct, uniquely defined by the minimizers of $\\varphi_\\mu(x)$. It does not depend on a numerical algorithm or a starting point. This statement confuses the theoretical path with a practical algorithm's trajectory.\n\nE. The central path converges to $(0,1)$ because, along the optimal face, the barrier repels the interior and pushes the solution toward the corner most aligned with the objective direction.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.** The limit is $(0, 1/2)$, not $(0,1)$. The barrier term for $x_2$, which is $-\\mu(\\log(x_2)+\\log(1-x_2))$, is symmetric and its influence centers the solution at $x_2=1/2$ along the optimal face, as the objective function has no component in the $x_2$ direction.
