For this problem, we perform cyclic updates on each coordinate $x_i$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$. A single iteration of BCD, denoted by a counter $t$, consists of one such full cycle of $n$ updates.\n\nFor a quadratic potential $\\Phi(x)$, the minimization with respect to a single coordinate $x_i$ can be performed exactly. To find the optimal value for $x_i$ while holding $x_j$ fixed for all $j \\neq i$, we solve the stationarity condition for the $i$-th coordinate:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Phi(x)}{\\partial x_i} = 0\n$$\nThe $i$-th component of the gradient $\\nabla \\Phi(x) = Qx+c$ is:\n$$\n(\\nabla \\Phi(x))_i = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} Q_{ij} x_j + c_i = Q_{ii} x_i + \\sum_{j \\neq i} Q_{ij} x_j + c_i\n$$\nSetting this to zero and solving for $x_i$ gives the update rule for the new value of coordinate $i$:\n$$\nx_i^{\\text{new}} = - \\frac{1}{Q_{ii}} \\left( \\sum_{j \\neq i} Q_{ij} x_j + c_i \\right)\n$$\nSince $Q$ is positive definite, its diagonal entries $Q_{ii}$ are all positive, ensuring the division is well-defined. Our implementation updates the coordinates of the vector $x$ sequentially within a cycle. This method is equivalent to the Gauss-Seidel method for solving the linear system $Qx = -c$. The algorithm starts from an initial point $x^{(0)}$ and terminates when the Euclidean distance to the true equilibrium, $\\lVert x^{(t)} - x^\\star \\rVert_2$, falls below a tolerance $\\varepsilon$, or a maximum number of cycles $T_{\\max}$ is reached.\n\n**3. Simultaneous Gradient Descent (GD)**\n\nSimultaneous Gradient Descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm that updates all components of the vector $x$ at the same time. The update is performed by taking a step in the direction opposite to the gradient of the potential function.\n\nThe update rule for an iteration $t$ with a fixed step-size $\\alpha > 0$ is:\n$$\nx^{(t+1)} = x^{(t)} - \\alpha \\nabla \\Phi(x^{(t)})\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the gradient, we get:\n$$\nx^{(t+1)} = x^{(t)} - \\alpha (Q x^{(t)} + c)\n$$\nFor GD to converge to the unique minimizer of a convex quadratic function, the step-size $\\alpha$ must be in the range $0 < \\alpha < 2/\\lambda_{\\max}(Q)$, where $\\lambda_{\\max}(Q)$ is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix $Q$. If $\\alpha$ is chosen outside this range, the algorithm may oscillate or diverge. The test suite includes a case where $\\alpha$ is deliberately chosen to be too large, leading to non-convergence. The stopping condition is the same as for BCD: $\\lVert x^{(t)} - x^\\star \\rVert_2 \\le \\varepsilon$ or the iteration count $t$ reaches the maximum budget $T_{\\max}$.\n\nThe implemented program consists of two primary functions, one for each algorithm, which take the problem parameters and return the number of iterations required for convergence. A main script iterates through the provided test cases, computes the exact solution $x^\\star$, runs a simulation for both BCD and GD, and formats the resulting iteration counts as specified.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef run_bcd(Q, c, x0, x_star, eps, T_max):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs Block Coordinate Descent on the quadratic potential Phi(x).\n    An iteration is one full cycle of n coordinate updates.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = Q.shape[0]\n    x_bcd = x0.copy()\n\n    # If the initial point is already within tolerance, it takes 0 iterations.\n    if np.linalg.norm(x_bcd - x_star) <= eps:\n        return 0\n\n    for t in range(1, T_max + 1):\n        for i in range(n):\n            # The update for x[i] is to exactly minimize Phi along the i-th axis.\n            # This is found by setting the i-th partial derivative to 0:\n            # (Qx)_i + c_i = 0 => Q_ii * x_i + sum_{j!=i} Q_ij * x_j + c_i = 0\n            # We use the most recently updated values of x (Gauss-Seidel style).\n            non_diag_sum = Q[i, :] @ x_bcd - Q[i, i] * x_bcd[i]\n            x_bcd[i] = -(non_diag_sum + c[i]) / Q[i, i]\n\n        # Check for convergence after each full cycle\n        if np.linalg.norm(x_bcd - x_star) <= eps:\n            return t\n    \n    return T_max\n\ndef run_gd(Q, c, x0, x_star, alpha, eps, T_max):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a fixed-step Simultaneous Gradient Descent on the potential Phi(x).\n    \"\"\"\n    x_gd = x0.copy()\n\n    # If the initial point is already within tolerance, it takes 0 iterations.\n    if np.linalg.norm(x_gd - x_star) <= eps:\n        return 0\n\n    for t in range(1, T_max + 1):\n        # Gradient of Phi(x) is nabla_Phi = Qx + c\n        grad = Q @ x_gd + c\n        \n        # Update step\n        x_gd = x_gd - alpha * grad\n        \n        # Check for convergence after each step\n        if np.linalg.norm(x_gd - x_star) <= eps:\n            return t\n        \n    return T_max\n\ndef solve():\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Test case 1\n        {\n            \"Q\": np.array([[3.0, 1.0, 0.0], [1.0, 4.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0, 2.0]]),\n            \"c\": np.array([-1.0, 2.0, -3.0]),\n            \"x0\": np.array([5.0, -4.0, 3.0]),\n            \"alpha\": 0.2,\n            \"eps\": 1e-6,\n            \"T_max\": 10000\n        },\n        # Test case 2\n        {\n            \"Q\": np.array([[1e-3, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0, 0.99], [0.0, 0.99, 1.0]]),\n            \"c\": np.array([0.1, -2.0, 1.0]),\n            \"x0\": np.array([3.0, -2.0, 4.0]),\n            \"alpha\": 0.5,\n            \"eps\": 1e-6,\n            \"T_max\": 10000\n        },\n        # Test case 3\n        {\n            \"Q\": np.array([[10.0, 2.0, 0.0], [2.0, 1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.5]]),\n            \"c\": np.array([5.0, -3.0, 1.0]),\n            \"x0\": np.array([-1.0, 5.0, 2.0]),\n            \"alpha\": 0.3,\n            \"eps\": 1e-6,\n            \"T_max\": 2000\n        },\n        # Test case 4\n        {\n            \"Q\": np.array([[2.0, -0.8], [-0.8, 1.5]]),\n            \"c\": np.array([-1.0, 2.5]),\n            \"x0\": np.array([10.0, -10.0]),\n            \"alpha\": 0.7,\n            \"eps\": 1e-6,\n            \"T_max\": 10000\n        }\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        Q, c, x0 = case[\"Q\"], case[\"c\"], case[\"x0\"]\n        alpha, eps, T_max = case[\"alpha\"], case[\"eps\"], case[\"T_max\"]\n\n        # 1.
