The parameters $c_1$ and $c_2$ are positive constants known as the cognitive and social coefficients, respectively, which control the influence of the personal and global best positions.

Thus, the relative influence of the personal-best attraction versus the global-best attraction is controlled directly by the magnitudes of $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$.\n\nFor Parameter Set A, $c_{1}\\gg c_{2}$. Therefore, for each particle $i$, the dominant pull in the velocity update is toward its own best $p_{i}$, since\n$$c_{1}r_{1}\\|p_{i}-x_{i}(t)\\|\\gg c_{2}r_{2}\\|p_{g}-x_{i}(t)\\|$$\nwhenever the distances are comparable, due to the coefficient disparity. Consequently, particles tend to exploit around their personal bests with relatively weak coupling to the swarmâ€™s global best. This promotes formation of multiple clusters, each around different $p_{i}$, and limits information sharing, a known cause of stagnation where particles settle near various local optima without coordinated convergence.\n\nFor Parameter Set B, $c_{2}\\gg c_{1}$. Then the social term dominates, and for each particle\n$$c_{2}r_{2}\\|p_{g}-x_{i}(t)\\|\\gg c_{1}r_{1}\\|p_{i}-x_{i}(t)\\|.$$\nThe strong attraction toward $p_{g}$ causes rapid contraction of the swarm toward the current global best. In non-convex landscapes with many local minima, this strong social pull frequently leads to the entire swarm collapsing prematurely around a single suboptimal local minimum (premature convergence), since exploration driven by the cognitive term is weak.\n\nTherefore, under Set A (high $c_{1}$, low $c_{2}$) the likely behavior is stagnation with clustering at multiple distinct local optima, and under Set B (low $c_{1}$, high $c_{2}$) the likely behavior is premature convergence to a single suboptimal local minimum. Among the options, this corresponds to choice B.\n\nNo other listed behavior aligns with these parameter regimes: uncontrolled divergence (option C) is not implied by increasing either $c_{1}$ or $c_{2}$ alone under fixed $w$, aimless wandering (option D) contradicts the strong attraction terms, and rapid efficient convergence to the true global minimum (option E) is not generally guaranteed in high-dimensional, multimodal landscapes with such imbalanced coefficients.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2176755"}, {"introduction": "While PSO relies on a velocity-based update, other metaheuristics like Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Differential Evolution (DE) use different mechanisms to generate new candidate solutions.
