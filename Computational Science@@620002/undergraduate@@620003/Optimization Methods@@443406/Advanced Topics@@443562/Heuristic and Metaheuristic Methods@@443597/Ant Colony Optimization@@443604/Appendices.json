The initial condition at the start, before any iterations, is given as:\n$$\n\\tau^{(0)} = \\tau_0\n$$\nThe problem states that in each iteration, a fixed fraction $\\rho$ of the current pheromone evaporates. The amount of pheromone that evaporates during iteration $k+1$ is $\\rho \\tau^{(k)}$. Consequently, the amount of pheromone remaining is the initial amount at the start of the iteration minus the evaporated amount.

The pheromone matrix, $\\mathcal{T} = [\\tau_{ij}]$, is initialized to a constant value $\\tau_0$ for all edges, with $\\tau_{ii}=0$. A global best tour, $\\mathcal{B}$, and its length, $L_{\\mathcal{B}}$, are initialized to a null state and infinity, respectively. All random choices are governed by a pseudo-random number generator initialized with the specified seed to ensure reproducibility for each test case.\n\n**2. Iterative Tour Construction and Improvement**\nThe core of the algorithm is a loop that runs for a fixed number of iterations, $T$. In each iteration, a colony of $m$ ants independently constructs solutions.\n\n- **Tour Construction**: Each ant begins at a uniformly random starting city. From its current city $i$, it selects the next city $j$ from the set of unvisited cities, $\\mathcal{J}_i$. The choice is probabilistic, guided by a combination of the pheromone trail $\\tau_{ij}$ and the heuristic information $\\eta_{ij}$. The transition probability is given by:\n$$p_{ij} = \\frac{[\\tau_{ij}]^{\\alpha}[\\eta_{ij}]^{\\beta}}{\\sum_{\\ell \\in \\mathcal{J}_i} [\\tau_{i\\ell}]^{\\alpha}[\\eta_{i\\ell}]^{\\beta}}$$\nThis process is repeated until a complete Hamiltonian cycle (a tour) is formed. This construction method embodies the fundamental ACO principle of biased random exploration, where past successful choices (stronger pheromone) and locally optimal choices (shorter distance) are favored.\n\n- **Local Search (Bounded 2-Opt)**: After an ant constructs a tour, it is improved using a 2-Opt local search. A 2-Opt move on a tour involves selecting two non-adjacent edges, say $(t_i, t_{i+1})$ and $(t_j, t_{j+1})$, removing them, and reconnecting the two resulting paths to form a new, valid tour. This is equivalent to reversing the segment of the tour between city $t_{i+1}$ and city $t_j$. The move is accepted only if it results in a strict decrease in the total tour length. The problem specifies a first-improvement strategy: candidate moves are scanned in a deterministic order, and the first valid improving move found is accepted. The entire scanning process is then restarted. This is repeated until a maximum of $k$ improvements have been made, or a full scan reveals no further improving moves (a 2-opt local optimum is reached). For $k=0$, this step is skipped. Introducing local search hybridizes the global search nature of ACO with a powerful local exploitation mechanism, generally leading to higher-quality solutions.\n\n**3. Pheromone Update**\nAfter all $m$ ants have completed their (potentially improved) tours in an iteration, the pheromone trails are updated. This learning mechanism is crucial for guiding subsequent ants.\n- **Evaporation**: All pheromone values are uniformly decreased: $\\tau_{ij} \\leftarrow (1-\\rho)\\tau_{ij}$. This mimics the natural decay of pheromone and helps the colony to \"forget\" poor choices and avoid premature convergence to a suboptimal region of the search space.\n- **Deposition**: Each of the $m$ ants deposits a quantity of pheromone on the edges of its final tour. The amount deposited is inversely proportional to the tour's length, $L$: $\\Delta\\tau_{ij} = Q/L$. Shorter tours result in a larger pheromone deposit, reinforcing the edges that constitute good solutions. The update rule is:\n$$\\tau_{ij} \\leftarrow \\tau_{ij} + \\sum_{a=1}^{m} \\Delta\\tau_{ij}^a$$\nwhere $\\Delta\\tau_{ij}^a = Q/L_a$ if edge $(i,j)$ is in the tour of ant $a$, and $0$ otherwise.\n\nThroughout this process, the globally best tour found by any ant in any iteration, $\\mathcal{B}$, is stored along with its length $L_{\\mathcal{B}}$.\n\n**4. Final Metric Calculation (SNR)**\nAfter the final iteration, the algorithm terminates. The final pheromone matrix $\\mathcal{T}$ and the best-so-far tour $\\mathcal{B}$ are used to compute the Signal-to-Noise Ratio. Let $E(\\mathcal{B})$ be the set of (undirected) edges in the best tour.\n- The \"signal\" $\\overline{\\tau}_{\\text{on}}$ is the average pheromone level on the edges belonging to the best tour:\n$$\\overline{\\tau}_{\\text{on}} = \\frac{1}{|E(\\mathcal{B})|} \\sum_{(i,j) \\in E(\\mathcal{B})} \\tau_{ij}$$\n- The \"noise\" $\\overline{\\tau}_{\\text{off}}$ is the average pheromone level on all other edges:\n$$\\overline{\\tau}_{\\text{off}} = \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{E}| - |E(\\mathcal{B})|} \\sum_{(i,j) \\in \\mathcal{E} \\setminus E(\\mathcal{B})} \\tau_{ij}$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{E}$ is the set of all possible edges in the graph. The SNR is their ratio, $\\mathrm{SNR} = \\overline{\\tau}_{\\text{on}} / \\overline{\\tau}_{\\text{off}}$, which quantifies the degree to which the collective learning process has concentrated pheromone on the optimal path. A higher SNR indicates stronger convergence and a clearer \"signal\" for the best solution.\n\nThis entire procedure is repeated for each value of $k$ in the test suite, with the random number generator being re-initialized for each case to ensure fair comparison.", "answer": "```python\n# The final answer must be a single, complete, standalone program.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main entry point to solve the problem.\n    It iterates through the test cases for k and prints the final result.\n    \"\"\"\n    problem_data = {\n        'coords': np.array([\n            (0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 5.0), (5.0, 2.0), (6.0, 6.0), (2.0, 7.0),\n            (8.0, 3.0), (7.0, 9.0), (3.5, 8.0), (9.0, 1.0), (4.0, 4.0),\n            (0.5, 9.5), (9.5, 9.5)\n        ]),\n        'params': {\n            'n_ants': 12, 'n_iterations': 40, 'alpha': 1.0, 'beta': 2.0,\n            'rho': 0.5, 'Q': 1.0, 'tau0': 1.0, 'seed': 42\n        },\n        'test_cases_k': [0, 1, 3, 100],\n        'epsilon': 1e-12\n    }\n\n    results = []\n    for k in problem_data['test_cases_k']:\n        snr = run_aco_simulation(k, problem_data)\n        results.append(f\"{snr:.6f}\")\n    \n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\ndef calculate_distance_matrix(coords):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Euclidean distance matrix between cities.\"\"\"\n    n_cities = len(coords)\n    dist_matrix = np.zeros((n_cities, n_cities))\n    for i in range(n_cities):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n_cities):\n            dist = np.linalg.norm(coords[i] -
