The derivation will proceed from first principles, as requested.\n\nFirst, we establish the requisite definitions. A function $f: C \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined on a convex set $C \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n$ is said to be a convex function if for any two points $x_1, x_2 \\in C$ and for any scalar $\\lambda \\in [0, 1]$, the following inequality holds:\n$$f(\\lambda x_1 + (1-\\lambda)x_2) \\le \\lambda f(x_1) + (1-\\lambda)f(x_2)$$\nThe convex hull of a set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n$, denoted $\\text{conv}(S)$, is the smallest convex set that contains $S$. It is the intersection of all convex sets containing $S$.\n\nThe optimization problem is to find the global minimum of the objective function $J(x) = (\\min\\{M, x^2\\} - b)^2$ over the interval $x \\in [l, u]$. The function $J(x)$ is non-convex due to the term $\\min\\{M, x^2\\}$. To apply convex optimization techniques, we reformulate the problem by introducing an auxiliary variable $y$. The original problem is equivalent to:\n$$ \\min_{x,y} (y-b)^2 $$\nsubject to:\n$$ y = \\min\\{M, x^2\\} $$\n$$ x \\in [l, u] $$\nThe equality constraint can be decomposed into a set of constraints that define the feasible region in the $(x,y)$-space:\n$$ y = x^2 $$\n$$ y \\le M $$\n$$ l \\le x \\le u $$\nThe constraint $y=x^2$ is non-convex. In the context of branch and bound, we seek a lower bound on the objective function over the domain defined by $x \\in [l, u]$. This is achieved by replacing the non-convex feasible region with a larger, convex region known as a convex relaxation. The key is to relax the non-convex constraint $y=x^2$.\n\nThe set of points satisfying $y=x^2$ for $x \\in [l, u]$ is the graph of the parabola over this interval. The function $f(x)=x^2$ is a convex function. The tightest convex relaxation of its graph is its convex hull. For a convex function $f(x)$ over an interval $[l, u]$, the convex hull of its graph is the set of points $(x,y)$ bounded below by the function itself and above by the secant line connecting the endpoints $(l, f(l))$ and $(u, f(u))$.\n\nGiven $f(x)=x^2$, the endpoints of the secant line are $(l, l^2)$ and $(u, u^2)$. The slope of the secant line is:\n$$ m = \\frac{u^2 - l^2}{u - l} = \\frac{(u-l)(u+l)}{u-l} = u+l $$\nThe equation of the secant line, $y_s(x)$, is given by the point-slope form:\n$$ y_s(x) - l^2 = (u+l)(x-l) $$\n$$ y_s(x) = (u+l)x - lu - l^2 + l^2 = (u+l)x - lu $$\nThe convex relaxation of the constraint $y=x^2$ for $x \\in [l, u]$ is therefore the pair of inequalities:\n$$ x^2 \\le y \\le (u+l)x - lu $$\nBy combining this with the other constraints, we define the convex relaxed feasible set $\\mathcal{R}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{R} = \\{ (x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid l \\le x \\le u, \\quad x^2 \\le y \\le (u+l)x - lu, \\quad y \\le M \\} $$\nThe relaxed optimization problem, which provides a lower bound on the original problem, is:\n$$ L_B = \\min_{(x,y) \\in \\mathcal{R}} (y-b)^2 $$\nThe objective function $(y-b)^2$ depends only on the variable $y$. Therefore, we can find the solution by first determining the range of feasible values for $y$ within the set $\\mathcal{R}$, and then minimizing the objective function over this range. Let $Y$ be the projection of $\\mathcal{R}$ onto the $y$-axis.\n$$ Y = \\{ y \\mid \\exists x \\text{ s.t. } (x,y) \\in \\mathcal{R} \\} $$\nFor a given $y$ to be in $Y$, there must exist an $x$ satisfying:\n1. $l \\le x \\le u$\n2. $y \\le M$\n3. $x^2 \\le y \\implies x \\le \\sqrt{y}$ (since $x>l>0$)\n4. $y \\le (u+l)x - lu \\implies x \\ge \\frac{y+lu}{u+l}$\n\nSo, for a given $y \\le M$, there must be an intersection between the interval $[l,u]$ and the interval for $x$ defined by $[\\frac{y+lu}{u+l}, \\sqrt{y}]$. For this latter interval to be non-empty, we require $\\frac{y+lu}{u+l} \\le \\sqrt{y}$, which is equivalent to $y - (u+l)\\sqrt{y} + lu \\le 0$. Letting $z = \\sqrt{y}$, this becomes the quadratic inequality $z^2 - (u+l)z + lu \\le 0$. The roots of the quadratic equation $z^2 - (u+l)z + lu = 0$ are $z=l$ and $z=u$. Therefore, the inequality holds for $z \\in [l, u]$, which implies $\\sqrt{y} \\in [l,u]$, or $y \\in [l^2, u^2]$.\nFor any $y \\in [l^2, u^2]$, the interval of valid $x$ values, $[\\frac{y+lu}{u+l}, \\sqrt{y}]$, is non-empty and is a sub-interval of $[l,u]$. Thus, a feasible $x$ exists.\nCombining this with the constraint $y \\le M$, the set of all possible values for $y$ is the interval $Y = [l^2, u^2] \\cap (-\\infty, M]$, which simplifies to:\n$$ Y = [l^2, \\min(M, u^2)] $$\nThe lower bound problem reduces to a one-dimensional minimization:\n$$ L_B = \\min_{y \\in [l^2, \\min(M, u^2)]} (y-b)^2 $$\nThe unconstrained minimum of $(y-b)^2$ occurs at $y=b$. The solution to the constrained problem is found by projecting the point $b$ onto the interval $[l^2, \\min(M, u^2)]$.\nLet $y_{min} = l^2$ and $y_{max} = \\min(M, u^2)$. The minimum value of the objective function is achieved at the point $y^*$ in $[y_{min}, y_{max}]$ that is closest to $b$.\nThe lower bound $L_B$ is therefore given by the following case-wise expression:\n$$ L_B = \\begin{cases} (l^2-b)^2 & \\text{if } b < l^2 \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } l^2 \\le b \\le \\min(M, u^2) \\\\ (\\min(M, u^2)-b)^2 & \\text{if } b > \\min(M, u^2) \\end{cases} $$\nThis expression is the required closed-form lower bound.\n\nWe now evaluate this bound for the given numerical values: $l=1$, $u=3$, $M=6$, and $b=8$.\nFirst, we determine the interval for $y$ in the relaxed problem:\n$$ y_{min} = l^2 = 1^2 = 1 $$\n$$ u^2 = 3^2 = 9 $$\n$$ y_{max} = \\min(M, u^2) = \\min(6, 9) = 6 $$\nThe interval is $Y = [1, 6]$.\nThe target value is $b=8$. We compare $b$ to this interval.\nSince $b = 8 > 6$, which is $y_{max}$, we are in the third case of the lower bound formula.\nThe lower bound $L_B$ is:\n$$ L_B = (y_{max} - b)^2 = (6 - 8)^2 = (-2)^2 = 4 $$\nThe numerical lower bound on $\\min_{x\\in[1,3]} \\left(\\min\\{6,x^{2}\\}-8\\right)^{2}$ is $4$.

Constructing the Univariate Convex Envelopes**\n\nThe convex envelope of a function over an interval is the tightest possible convex underestimator. For a concave function on an interval $[a, b]$, its convex envelope is the line segment (chord) connecting the points $(a, f(a))$ and $(b, f(b))$.

Solving the Relaxed Problem for the Lower Bound**\n\nThe relaxed problem is to minimize the sum of the convex envelopes subject to the original constraints:\n$$ \\min_{x} \\quad L(x) = f_1^{\\mathrm{env}}(x_1) + f_2^{\\mathrm{env}}(x_2) + f_3^{\\mathrm{env}}(x_3) $$\n$$ \\text{s.t.} \\quad x_1 \\in [1,3], \\quad x_2 \\in [2,5], \\quad x_3 \\in [0,4], \\quad x_1+x_2+x_3 = 7. $$\nThe objective function $L(x)$ is linear.
