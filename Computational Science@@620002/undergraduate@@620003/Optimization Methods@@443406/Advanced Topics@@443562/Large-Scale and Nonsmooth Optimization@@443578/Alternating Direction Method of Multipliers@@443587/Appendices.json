Specifically, for our problem, the iterates $(x^k, z^k)$ will converge to a pair $(x^*, z^*)$ such that $x^*=z^*$ is an optimal solution to the basis pursuit problem. The problem statement assumes that the sensing matrix $A$ satisfies a Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) of a suitable order and constant. Under this condition, the $s$-sparse solution $x^{\\star}$ to $Ax=b$ is unique and is also the unique solution to the basis pursuit problem $\\min \\|x\\|_1$ subject to $Ax=b$. Since ADMM is guaranteed to converge to a solution of this convex problem, and the solution is unique under the RIP assumption, the algorithm will converge to this unique sparse vector $x^{\\star}$ regardless of the choice of the parameter $\\rho$ (as long as $\\rho > 0$). The limit point is determined by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions of the problem, which are independent of $\\rho$.\n\nHowever, the parameter $\\rho$ plays a crucial role in the convergence *speed* and numerical behavior of the algorithm. The choice of $\\rho$ determines the balance between minimizing the objective function and satisfying the consensus constraint $x=z$.\n- If $\\rho$ is large, the penalty on the primal residual $\\|x-z\\|_2^2$ in the augmented Lagrangian is high. This forces the iterates $x^k$ and $z^k$ to be close to each other. However, a large $\\rho$ means the soft-thresholding parameter $1/\\rho$ is small. This results in very little shrinkage in the $z$-update, slowing down the progress towards making $z$ (and thus $x$) sparse, which is the primary objective.\n- If $\\rho$ is small, the penalty on the primal residual is low, allowing $x^k$ and $z^k$ to be far apart. The soft-thresholding parameter $1/\\rho$ is large, leading to aggressive thresholding in the $z$-update. This can quickly drive many components of $z$ to zero, making rapid progress on the $\\ell_1$ objective. However, the weak enforcement of the $x=z$ constraint can mean that the iterates take a long time to converge to a point that is feasible for the original problem (i.e., where $x=z$ and $Ax=b$).\n\nIn summary, there is a trade-off: $\\rho$ balances minimizing the objective and satisfying the constraints. The optimal choice of $\\rho$, which is often problem-dependent, leads to the fastest convergence. While an arbitrary positive $\\rho$ guarantees eventual convergence to the correct sparse solution (under RIP), a poor choice can lead to extremely slow convergence, which can be mistaken for numerical instability or non-convergence in practice. The numerical stability of the subproblems themselves (a projection and a soft-thresholding) is generally good, so the main influence of $\\rho$ is on the rate of convergence of the overall algorithm.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3096765"}]}
