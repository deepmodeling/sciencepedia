This exercise provides a tangible demonstration of this principle by exploring a crop planning problem.

The profit per acre is $p_A = 300$ for crop $A$ and $p_B = 120$ for crop $B$, measured in monetary units per acre. Crop $A$ requires $w_A = 4$ units of water per acre, and crop $B$ requires $w_B = 1$ unit of water per acre. The farm has a total land endowment of $L = 100$ acres.

The problem is objective and well-posed, leading to a unique and meaningful solution. There are no violations of the validation criteria.\n\n**Verdict: The problem is valid.**\n\nWe proceed with the solution.\n\n**Primal and Dual LP Formulation**\nThe objective is to maximize the total profit $Z$. The primal LP can be formulated as:\n$$\n\\text{Maximize} \\quad Z = 300x_1 + 120x_2\n$$\nsubject to:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nx_1 + x_2 &\\le 100 & & \\text{(Land constraint)} \\\\\n4x_1 + x_2 &\\le W & & \\text{(Water constraint)} \\\\\nx_1, x_2 &\\ge 0 & & \\text{(Non-negativity)}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nwhere $W$ is the total water availability.\n\nThe corresponding dual LP, with dual variables $y_L$ and $y_W$ representing the shadow prices of land and water, respectively, is:\n$$\n\\text{Minimize} \\quad C = 100y_L + W y_W\n$$\nsubject to:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ny_L + 4y_W &\\ge 300 & & \\text{(Dual constraint for } x_1) \\\\\ny_L + y_W &\\ge 120 & & \\text{(Dual constraint for } x_2) \\\\\ny_L, y_W &\\ge 0 & & \\text{(Non-negativity)}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n**Analysis of the Normal Scenario ($W = W_N = 500$)**\nThe primal problem is:\n$$\n\\text{Maximize} \\quad Z = 300x_1 + 120x_2\n$$\nsubject to:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nx_1 + x_2 &\\le 100 \\\\\n4x_1 + x_2 &\\le 500 \\\\\nx_1, x_2 &\\ge 0\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nLet's analyze the constraints. For any feasible point satisfying the land constraint ($x_1+x_2 \\le 100$ and $x_1, x_2 \\ge 0$), we have $x_1 \\le 100$. We can write the water consumption as $4x_1 + x_2 = 3x_1 + (x_1+x_2)$. Since $x_1 \\le 100$ and $x_1+x_2 \\le 100$, the maximum possible water consumption under the land constraint is $3(100) + 100 = 400$. Since $400 < 500$, the water constraint $4x_1 + x_2 \\le 500$ is always satisfied if the land constraint is satisfied. Thus, the water constraint is redundant.\n\nThe problem simplifies to:\n$$\n\\text{Maximize} \\quad Z = 300x_1 + 120x_2 \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad x_1 + x_2 \\le 100, \\ x_1, x_2 \\ge 0.\n$$\nSince the profit per acre for crop A ($p_A = 300$) is greater than for crop B ($p_B = 120$), the optimal strategy is to allocate all the land to crop A.\nThe optimal solution is $x_1^{(N)*} = 100$ and $x_2^{(N)*} = 0$.\n\nNow, we determine the shadow prices using the complementary slackness conditions.\n1.  The primal water constraint is not binding: $4x_1^{(N)*} + x_2^{(N)*} = 4(100) + 0 = 400 < 500$. Therefore, its corresponding dual variable must be zero: $y_W^{(N)} = 0$.\n2.  The primal land constraint is binding: $x_1^{(N)*} + x_2^{(N)*} = 100 + 0 = 100$. Its dual variable $y_L^{(N)}$ can be non-zero.\n3.  The primal variable $x_1^{(N)*} > 0$, so its corresponding dual constraint must be binding: $y_L^{(N)} + 4y_W^{(N)} = 300$.\n4.  The primal variable $x_2^{(N)*} = 0$, so its corresponding dual constraint may or may not be binding. We must check: $y_L^{(N)} + y_W^{(N)} \\ge 120$.\n\nSubstituting $y_W^{(N)} = 0$ into the binding dual constraint gives:\n$y_L^{(N)} + 4(0) = 300 \\implies y_L^{(N)} = 300$.\nChecking the other dual constraint: $300 + 0 = 300 \\ge 120$, which is satisfied.\nThe shadow prices for the normal scenario are $y_L^{(N)} = 300$ and $y_W^{(N)} = 0$. This is economically intuitive: with surplus water, an additional unit of water has no marginal value.\n\n**Analysis of the Drought Scenario ($W = W_D = 80$)**\nThe primal problem is:\n$$\n\\text{Maximize} \\quad Z = 300x_1 + 120x_2\n$$\nsubject to:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nx_1 + x_2 &\\le 100 \\\\\n4x_1 + x_2 &\\le 80 \\\\\nx_1, x_2 &\\ge 0\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nIn this case, for any point satisfying the water constraint ($4x_1+x_2 \\le 80$ and $x_1, x_2 \\ge 0$), we have $x_1+x_2 \\le 4x_1+x_2 \\le 80$. Since $80 < 100$, the land constraint $x_1+x_2 \\le 100$ is always satisfied if the water constraint is satisfied. Thus, the land constraint is redundant.\n\nThe problem simplifies to:\n$$\n\\text{Maximize} \\quad Z = 300x_1 + 120x_2 \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad 4x_1 + x_2 \\le 80, \\ x_1, x_2 \\ge 0.\n$$\nIn this water-scarce regime, the limiting resource is water. We must choose the crop that provides the highest profit per unit of water.\n- Profit per unit of water for crop A: $\\frac{p_A}{w_A} = \\frac{300}{4} = 75$.\n- Profit per unit of water for crop B: $\\frac{p_B}{w_B} = \\frac{120}{1} = 120$.\nSince crop B is more profitable per unit of water, the optimal strategy is to allocate all the available water to crop B.\nThe optimal solution is found by setting $x_1=0$ and using the entire water budget for $x_2$: $4(0) + x_2 = 80 \\implies x_2 = 80$.\nThe optimal solution is $x_1^{(D)*} = 0$ and $x_2^{(D)*} = 80$.\n\nWe determine the shadow prices using complementary slackness:\n1.  The primal land constraint is not binding: $x_1^{(D)*} + x_2^{(D)*} = 0 + 80 = 80 < 100$. Therefore, its corresponding dual variable must be zero: $y_L^{(D)} = 0$.\n2.  The primal water constraint is binding: $4x_1^{(D)*} + x_2^{(D)*} = 4(0) + 80 = 80$. Its dual variable $y_W^{(D)}$ can be non-zero.\n3.  The primal variable $x_2^{(D)*} > 0$, so its corresponding dual constraint must be binding: $y_L^{(D)} + y_W^{(D)} = 120$.\n4.  The primal variable $x_1^{(D)*} = 0$, so its dual constraint may or may not be binding. We must check: $y_L^{(D)} + 4y_W^{(D)} \\ge 300$.\n\nSubstituting $y_L^{(D)} = 0$ into the binding dual constraint gives:\n$0 + y_W^{(D)} = 120 \\implies y_W^{(D)} = 120$.\nChecking the other dual constraint: $0 + 4(120) = 480 \\ge 300$, which is satisfied.\nThe shadow prices for the drought scenario are $y_L^{(D)} = 0$ and $y_W^{(D)} = 120$. This is also economically intuitive: land is in surplus, so its marginal value is zero. An extra unit of water would be allocated to crop B (the most water-efficient), yielding a marginal profit of $120$.\n\n**Regime Switch and Final Calculation**\nThe two scenarios illustrate a regime switch based on resource scarcity.\n- In the normal scenario, land is the limiting resource, so the farm prioritizes the crop with the highest profit per acre (A). Water is abundant, so its shadow price is $y_W^{(N)} = 0$.\n- In the drought scenario, water is the limiting resource, so the farm prioritizes the crop with the highest profit per unit of water (B). Land is abundant, so its shadow price is zero, while the shadow price of water is determined by the marginal productivity of water in its best use: $y_W^{(D)} = 120$.\n\nThe difference in water shadow prices between the two scenarios is:\n$$\n\\Delta = y_W^{(D)} - y_W^{(N)} = 120 - 0 = 120\n$$\n\nThe final answer is $120$ monetary units per unit of water.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{120}$$", "id": "3124428"}, {"introduction": "The powerful concept of shadow pricing extends beyond linear models into the realm of nonlinear optimization.

Since $\\theta > 0$ and $B > 0$, it is possible to choose $x_1 > 0$ and $x_2 > 0$ such that $x_1+x_2 \\le B$, which yields a production greater than $0$. Therefore, the optimal solution must occur where $x_1^* > 0$ and $x_2^* > 0$.\n\nFrom the complementary slackness conditions $\\mu_1^* x_1^* = 0$ and $\\mu_2^* x_2^* = 0$, our deduction that $x_1^* > 0$ and $x_2^* > 0$ implies that $\\mu_1^* = 0$ and $\\mu_2^* = 0$.\n\nThe stationarity conditions simplify to:\n$$\np \\theta (x_1^*)^{p-1} (x_2^*)^q = \\lambda^*\n$$\n$$\nq \\theta (x_1^*)^p (x_2^*)^{q-1} = \\lambda^*\n$$\nThe left-hand sides represent the marginal product of each input, scaled by $\\theta$.

Economic Interpretation and the Envelope Principle**\n\nThe envelope theorem for constrained optimization states that the derivative of the value function with respect to a constraint parameter is equal to the optimal value of the Lagrange multiplier associated with that constraint. Let $V(B)$ be the optimal value of the objective function for a given resource level $B$. The Lagrangian is $\\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{L}(x_1, x_2, \\lambda, \\dots; B)$.\nAccording to the envelope principle:\n$$\n\\frac{d V(B)}{d B} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial B} \\bigg|_{(x^*, \\lambda^*, \\mu^*)} = \\lambda^*(B)\n$$\nThis confirms the economic interpretation of the shadow price $\\lambda(B)$: it is the marginal productivity of the aggregate resource $B$, i.e., the rate at which the maximum possible output increases for an infinitesimal increase in the total resource budget.\n\nTo determine if the marginal productivity of the resource exhibits diminishing returns, we examine how $\\lambda(B)$ changes as $B$ increases. This requires finding the sign of the derivative $\\frac{d\\lambda}{dB}$. Our expression for the shadow price is of the form $\\lambda(B) = K B^{\\alpha}$, where the constant $K = \\theta \\frac{p^p q^q}{(p+q)^{p+q-1}}$ is positive and the exponent is $\\alpha = p+q-1$.\n\nThe derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\lambda}{dB} = K \\cdot (p+q-1) B^{p+q-2}\n$$\nThe sign of this derivative is determined by the sign of the exponent $(p+q-1)$. The problem statement specifies that $p+q < 1$. This implies that the exponent is negative:\n$$\np+q-1 < 0\n$$\nSince $K > 0$ and $B^{p+q-2} > 0$ (as $B>0$), the derivative is negative:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\lambda}{dB} < 0\n$$\nA negative derivative means that $\\lambda(B)$ is a decreasing function of $B$. As the total amount of available resource $B$ increases, the marginal value (or productivity) of each additional unit of that resource decreases. This is the definition of diminishing marginal returns. The condition $p+q<1$, which corresponds to diminishing returns to scale for the production function, directly leads to diminishing marginal productivity of the aggregate resource budget.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\theta \\frac{p^p q^q}{(p+q)^{p+q-1}} B^{p+q-1}}\n$$", "id": "3124393"}, {"introduction": "Shadow prices are not just theoretical concepts; they are at the heart of modern market designs for critical infrastructure like electricity grids.

We associate multipliers $\\eta_1$ and $\\eta_2$ respectively.\n\nThe Lagrangian function $\\mathcal{L}$ for this problem is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} = 20g_1 + 50g_2 + \\lambda_1(f_{12} - g_1) + \\lambda_2(150 - g_2 - f_{12}) + \\mu_{12}^{\\text{max}}(f_{12} - 60) + \\mu_{12}^{\\text{min}}(-f_{12} - 60) - \\eta_1 g_1 - \\eta_2 g_2\n$$\n\nThe Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for optimality are:\n1.  **Stationarity**: The partial derivatives of $\\mathcal{L}$ with respect to the primal variables must be zero.\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial g_1} = 20 - \\lambda_1 - \\eta_1 = 0 $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial g_2} = 50 - \\lambda_2 - \\eta_2 = 0 $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial f_{12}} = \\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2 + \\mu_{12}^{\\text{max}} - \\mu_{12}^{\\text{min}} = 0 $$\n2.  **Primal Feasibility**: The original constraints must be satisfied.\n    $$ g_1 - f_{12} = 0 $$\n    $$ g_2 + f_{12} = 150 $$\n    $$ f_{12} \\le 60 $$\n    $$ -f_{12} \\le 60 $$\n    $$ g_1 \\ge 0, g_2 \\ge 0 $$\n3.  **Dual Feasibility**: The Lagrange multipliers for inequality constraints must be non-negative.\n    $$ \\mu_{12}^{\\text{max}} \\ge 0, \\mu_{12}^{\\text{min}} \\ge 0, \\eta_1 \\ge 0, \\eta_2 \\ge 0 $$\n4.  **Complementary Slackness**: The product of an inequality constraint's multiplier and its slack must be zero.\n    $$ \\mu_{12}^{\\text{max}}(f_{12} - 60) = 0 $$\n    $$ \\mu_{12}^{\\text{min}}(-f_{12} - 60) = 0 $$\n    $$ \\eta_1 g_1 = 0 $$\n    $$ \\eta_2 g_2 = 0 $$\n\nTo solve this system, we assume both generators will be dispatched to meet the load (i.e., $g_1 > 0$ and $g_2 > 0$). This assumption is reasonable because the cheap generator at Bus $1$ is insufficient to meet the total load of $150$ MW due to the line limit, requiring the generator at Bus $2$ to operate. If $g_1 > 0$ and $g_2 > 0$, then from complementary slackness, $\\eta_1=0$ and $\\eta_2=0$.\n\nThe stationarity conditions for $g_1$ and $g_2$ simplify to:\n$20 - \\lambda_1 = 0 \\implies \\lambda_1 = 20$\n$50 - \\lambda_2 = 0 \\implies \\lambda_2 = 50$\nThese dual variables, $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$, are the Locational Marginal Prices (LMPs) at Bus $1$ and Bus $2$, respectively, in units of dollars per megawatt-hour.\n\nSubstituting these LMP values into the stationarity condition for $f_{12}$:\n$20 - 50 + \\mu_{12}^{\\text{max}} - \\mu_{12}^{\\text{min}} = 0 \\implies \\mu_{12}^{\\text{max}} - \\mu_{12}^{\\text{min}} = 30$\n\nNow, we analyze the state of the transmission line.\n- If the line were not congested ($-60  f_{12}  60$), complementary slackness would require $\\mu_{12}^{\\text{max}} = 0$ and $\\mu_{12}^{\\text{min}} = 0$. This would lead to $30 = 0$, a contradiction. Therefore, the line must be congested.\n- There is an economic incentive to send power from Bus $1$ (cheaper) to Bus $2$ (more expensive), so we test for congestion in the $1 \\to 2$ direction. Let's assume $f_{12} = 60$. This means the constraint $f_{12} \\le 60$ is binding, so $\\mu_{12}^{\\text{max}} \\ge 0$. The other line constraint, $-f_{12} \\le 60$, is not binding, so $\\mu_{12}^{\\text{min}} = 0$. The stationarity equation for flow becomes $\\mu_{12}^{\\text{max}} - 0 = 30$, so $\\mu_{12}^{\\text{max}} = 30$. This is consistent with dual feasibility ($\\mu_{12}^{\\text{max}} \\ge 0$).\n\nWith $f_{12}^* = 60$ MW, we find the optimal generation dispatch from the power balance equations:\n$g_1^* = f_{12}^* = 60 \\text{ MW}$\n$g_2^* = 150 - f_{12}^* = 150 - 60 = 90 \\text{ MW}$\nSince $g_1^* > 0$ and $g_2^* > 0$, our initial assumption holds. We have found the unique KKT point, which for a convex LP is the global optimum.\n\nThe optimal solution is: a dispatch of $g_1^*=60$ MW and $g_2^*=90$ MW, with a power flow of $f_{12}^*=60$ MW. The LMPs are $\\lambda_1=20$ \\$/MWh and $\\lambda_2=50$ \\$/MWh. The shadow prices on the line limits are $\\mu_{12}^{\\text{max}}=30$ \\$/(MWh) and $\\mu_{12}^{\\text{min}}=0$.\n\nThe price separation is explained by the stationarity condition for flow, $\\lambda_2 - \\lambda_1 = \\mu_{12}^{\\text{max}} - \\mu_{12}^{\\text{min}}$. When the line is uncongested, the shadow prices are zero, and LMPs are equal. When the line from Bus $1$ to Bus $2$ congests, the price at Bus $2$ becomes separated from the price at Bus $1$. The difference, $\\lambda_2 - \\lambda_1 = 50 - 20 = 30$ \\$/MWh, is exactly equal to the shadow price of the congested line limit, $\\mu_{12}^{\\text{max}}$. This difference reflects the marginal cost of transmission congestion; it is the amount by which the total system cost would decrease if the line's capacity were increased by one marginal unit (1 MW).\n\nThe total congestion rent is the revenue collected by the transmission operator. It is calculated as the product of the flow on the congested line and the difference in LMPs across it.\n$$ \\text{Congestion Rent} = f_{12}^* \\times (\\lambda_2 - \\lambda_1) $$\n$$ \\text{Congestion Rent} = 60 \\text{ MW} \\times (50 \\text{ \\$/MWh} - 20 \\text{ \\$/MWh}) $$\n$$ \\text{Congestion Rent} = 60 \\times 30 = 1800 \\text{ \\$/h} $$\nAlternatively, the rent is the value of the congested capacity, given by the capacity limit multiplied by its shadow price:\n$$ \\text{Congestion Rent} = \\mu_{12}^{\\text{max}} \\times (\\text{line limit}) = 30 \\text{ \\$/(MWh)} \\times 60 \\text{ MW} = 1800 \\text{ \\$/h} $$\nThe result is $1800$ dollars per hour.
