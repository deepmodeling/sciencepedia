Let $x_1, x_2, x_3$ represent the duration (in hours) for which each process is run. The total energy consumption, which the plant seeks to minimize, is a linear function of these durations. The objective function to minimize is $E = 4x_1 + 3x_2 + 5x_3$ in units of megawatt-hours (MWh).\n\nFor the chip to function correctly, two quality control specifications must be met. These relate to the minimum required concentration of two types of dopants, P-type and N-type, which are functions of the process durations.\n1.  P-type dopant concentration constraint: $2x_1 + x_2 + 3x_3 \\ge 10$ (in arbitrary concentration units)\n2.  N-type dopant concentration constraint: $x_1 + 2x_2 + x_3 \\ge 12$ (in arbitrary concentration units)\n3.  The durations must be non-negative: $x_1, x_2, x_3 \\ge 0$.\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem using the dual simplex method, you must first set up the initial tableau. The standard form for this method requires converting the $\\ge$ inequalities to $\\le$ inequalities before adding slack variables ($s_1, s_2$) to form equalities. The tableau should be arranged with the objective function row first, followed by the rows for the two constraints. The columns should represent the variables in the order $x_1, x_2, x_3, s_1, s_2$.\n\nDetermine the location of the first pivot element that would be chosen according to the rules of the dual simplex algorithm. Express your answer as a pair of integers (row index, column index). These indices refer to the position within the matrix of coefficients corresponding to the constraints (i.e., excluding the objective row and the solution/RHS column). Use 1-based indexing, where row 1 is the first constraint row and column 1 corresponds to variable $x_1$.", "solution": "We are to minimize $E = 4x_{1} + 3x_{2} + 5x_{3}$ subject to\n$$2x_{1} + x_{2} + 3x_{3} \\ge 10, \\quad x_{1} + 2x_{2} + x_{3} \\ge 12, \\quad x_{1},x_{2},x_{3} \\ge 0.$$\n\nFor the dual simplex method in the requested standard form, convert the $\\ge$ constraints to $\\le$ by multiplying both sides by $-1$, then add slack variables $s_{1}, s_{2} \\ge 0$:\n$$-2x_{1} - x_{2} - 3x_{3} + s_{1} = -10,$$\n$$-x_{1} - 2x_{2} - x_{3} + s_{2} = -12.$$\n\nThe objective function for a minimization problem is $E = 4x_1 + 3x_2 + 5x_3$.
