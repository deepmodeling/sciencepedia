Optimal Solution and Binding Constraints**\n\nThis is a two-dimensional LP problem, which can be solved graphically by examining the vertices of the feasible region. The feasible region is a polygon in the first quadrant defined by the inequalities. The vertices are the intersection points of the boundary lines.\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region are:\n- Intersection of $x_1=0$ and $x_2=0$: $(0, 0)$.\n- Intersection of $x_1=3$ and $x_2=0$: $(3, 0)$.\n- Intersection of $x_1=3$ and $2x_1+x_2=8$: $2(3)+x_2=8 \\implies x_2=2$. The vertex is $(3, 2)$. Note that this point satisfies $x_1+2x_2 = 3+2(2)=7 \\leq 8$.\n- Intersection of $2x_1+x_2=8$ and $x_1+2x_2=8$: From $x_2=8-2x_1$, we substitute into the second equation: $x_1+2(8-2x_1)=8 \\implies x_1+16-4x_1=8 \\implies 3x_1=8 \\implies x_1=8/3$. Then $x_2=8-2(8/3) = 8-16/3 = 8/3$. The vertex is $(8/3, 8/3)$. Note that this point satisfies $x_1 = 8/3 \\leq 3$.\n- Intersection of $x_1=0$ and $x_1+2x_2=8$: $2x_2=8 \\implies x_2=4$. The vertex is $(0, 4)$.\n\nWe evaluate the objective function $z = 3x_{1} + 2x_{2}$ at each vertex:\n- At $(0, 0)$: $z=3(0)+2(0)=0$.\n- At $(3, 0)$: $z=3(3)+2(0)=9$.\n- At $(3, 2)$: $z=3(3)+2(2)=13$.\n- At $(8/3, 8/3)$: $z=3(8/3)+2(8/3)=8+16/3=40/3 \\approx 13.33$.\n- At $(0, 4)$: $z=3(0)+2(4)=8$.\n\nThe maximum value of the objective function is $z^{\\star}=40/3$, which occurs at the vertex $(8/3, 8/3)$. Thus, the optimal solution vector is $x^{\\star} = \\begin{pmatrix} 8/3 \\\\ 8/3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nTo determine which constraints are binding at $x^{\\star}$, we substitute the optimal solution into the original inequalities:\n- Constraint (1): $2(8/3) + 8/3 = 16/3 + 8/3 = 24/3 = 8$. Since $8 \\leq 8$ holds with equality, this constraint is **binding**.\n- Constraint (2): $8/3 + 2(8/3) = 8/3 + 16/3 = 24/3 = 8$. Since $8 \\leq 8$ holds with equality, this constraint is **binding**.\n- Constraint (3): $8/3 \\leq 3$. Since $8/3 \\approx 2.67$, the inequality $2.67 \\leq 3$ is strict. This constraint is **non-binding**.\n- Constraint (4): $8/3 \\geq 0$. This is strict, hence non-binding.\n- Constraint (5): $8/3 \\geq 0$. This is strict, hence non-binding.\n\nThe binding constraints at $x^{\\star}$ are $2x_{1} + x_{2} = 8$ and $x_{1} + 2x_{2} = 8$.\n\n**2. Effect of Changing the RHS of a Non-binding Constraint**\n\nThe problem is modified by changing constraint (3) to $x_{1} \\leq 3 - \\Delta$, where $\\Delta \\geq 0$. We must explain why the solution $x^{\\star}$ remains optimal for a range of $\\Delta$. We use the theory of duality.\n\nThe dual problem (D) corresponding to the original primal problem (P) is:\n$$ \\text{minimize } w = 8y_{1} + 8y_{2} + 3y_{3} $$\nsubject to\n\\begin{align*} 2y_{1} + y_{2} + y_{3} &\\geq 3 \\\\ y_{1} + 2y_{2} &\\geq 2 \\\\ y_{1}, y_{2}, y_{3} &\\geq 0 \\end{align*}\nwhere $y_1, y_2, y_3$ are the dual variables corresponding to the primal constraints (1), (2), and (3) respectively.\n\nThe Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, which include primal feasibility, dual feasibility, and complementary slackness, must hold at optimality.\nFrom Part 1, we know $x^{\\star}=(8/3, 8/3)$. Since $x_1^{\\star} > 0$ and $x_2^{\\star} > 0$, the corresponding dual constraints must be binding at the dual optimum $y^{\\star}$:\n\\begin{align*} 2y_1^{\\star} + y_2^{\\star} + y_3^{\\star} &= 3 \\\\ y_1^{\\star} + 2y_2^{\\star} &= 2 \\end{align*}\nAlso, since primal constraint (3), $x_1 \\leq 3$, is non-binding at $x^{\\star}$ (i.e., $x_1^{\\star} < 3$), its corresponding dual variable must be zero by complementary slackness: $y_3^{\\star}=0$.\n\nSubstituting $y_3^{\\star}=0$ into the system gives:\n\\begin{align*} 2y_1^{\\star} + y_2^{\\star} &= 3 \\\\ y_1^{\\star} + 2y_2^{\\star} &= 2 \\end{align*}\nSolving this system yields $y_1^{\\star}=4/3$ and $y_2^{\\star}=1/3$. The optimal dual solution is $y^{\\star}=(4/3, 1/3, 0)$. This solution is dual feasible as $y_1^{\\star} \\geq 0, y_2^{\\star} \\geq 0, y_3^{\\star} \\geq 0$.\n\nNow, consider the new problem (P') with the constraint $x_{1} \\leq 3 - \\Delta$. The corresponding new dual problem (D') is:\n$$ \\text{minimize } w' = 8y_{1} + 8y_{2} + (3-\\Delta)y_{3} $$\nsubject to the same constraints as (D).\n\nFor the pair $(x^{\\star}, y^{\\star})$ to remain optimal for the new problem, it must satisfy the optimality conditions for (P') and (D'):\n- **Dual Feasibility**: The constraints of (D') are identical to those of (D). Since $y^{\\star}=(4/3, 1/3, 0)$ was feasible for (D), it remains feasible for (D').\n- **Primal Feasibility**: The original solution $x^{\\star}=(8/3, 8/3)$ must be feasible for (P'). The first two constraints and the non-negativity constraints are unaffected and satisfied. The only condition to check is the modified one: $x_{1}^{\\star} \\leq 3 - \\Delta$, which means $8/3 \\leq 3 - \\Delta$. As long as this holds, $x^{\\star}$ is primal feasible.\n- **Complementary Slackness**: We check the conditions for the pair $(x^{\\star}, y^{\\star})$ with respect to the new problem.\n  - $y_1^{\\star}(8 - (2x_1^{\\star} + x_2^{\\star})) = (4/3)(8 - 8) = 0$. (Holds)\n  - $y_2^{\\star}(8 - (x_1^{\\star} + 2x_2^{\\star})) = (1/3)(8 - 8) = 0$. (Holds)\n  - $y_3^{\\star}((3-\\Delta) - x_1^{\\star}) = 0 \\cdot ((3-\\Delta) - 8/3) = 0$. This holds for any $\\Delta$.\n  - $x_1^{\\star}( (2y_1^{\\star} + y_2^{\\star} + y_3^{\\star}) - 3 ) = (8/3)( (2(4/3) + 1/3 + 0) - 3) = (8/3)(3-3)=0$. (Holds)\n  - $x_2^{\\star}( (y_1^{\\star} + 2y_2^{\\star}) - 2 ) = (8/3)( (4/3 + 2(1/3)) - 2) = (8/3)(2-2)=0$. (Holds)\n\nAll optimality conditions are satisfied provided that $x^{\\star}$ remains primal feasible. The crucial observation is that because the original constraint was non-binding, its dual variable $y_3^{\\star}$ is zero. This zero value \"absorbs\" the change in the RHS of that constraint, leaving the dual objective value at $y^{\\star}$ unchanged: $w'(y^{\\star}) = 8(4/3) + 8(1/3) + (3-\\Delta)(0) = 40/3$. The primal objective value at $x^{\\star}$ is also unchanged at $z(x^{\\star})=40/3$. Since the primal objective equals the dual objective, and both solutions are feasible within a certain range of $\\Delta$, they must remain optimal.\n\n**3. Computation of $\\Delta_{\\max}$**\n\nAs established in Part 2, the solution $x^{\\star}=(8/3, 8/3)$ and value $z^{\\star}=40/3$ remain optimal as long as $x^{\\star}$ remains a feasible solution to the perturbed problem. The only constraint that can be violated is the modified one. The condition for feasibility is:\n$$ x_{1}^{\\star} \\leq 3 - \\Delta $$\nSubstituting the value $x_{1}^{\\star}=8/3$:\n$$ \\frac{8}{3} \\leq 3 - \\Delta $$\nWe are looking for the largest non-negative $\\Delta$ that satisfies this inequality. We can rearrange the inequality to solve for $\\Delta$:\n$$ \\Delta \\leq 3 - \\frac{8}{3} $$\n$$ \\Delta \\leq \\frac{9}{3} - \\frac{8}{3} $$\n$$ \\Delta \\leq \\frac{1}{3} $$\nCombined with the given condition $\\Delta \\geq 0$, the old solution remains optimal for all $\\Delta$ in the range $0 \\leq \\Delta \\leq 1/3$. The largest non-negative value for $\\Delta$ for which this holds is $\\Delta_{\\max} = 1/3$. If $\\Delta > 1/3$, the point $x^{\\star}$ becomes infeasible, and the location of the optimal solution must change.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$$", "id": "3179215"}, {"introduction": "In contrast to a non-binding constraint, a binding constraint acts as a bottleneck, and its shadow price quantifies the cost of this limitation.

We will use the theory of linear programming (LP) duality and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions.\n\n**1. Primal and Dual Formulation**\n\nThe primal problem (P) is to minimize the cost of food, given by:\n$$ \\text{minimize } Z = 0.50 x_1 + 0.60 x_2 $$\nsubject to nutritional constraints:\n\\begin{align*} 200 x_1 + 100 x_2 &\\ge 600 \\quad &\\text{(Calories)} \\\\ 4 x_1 + 10 x_2 &\\ge 24 \\quad &\\text{(Protein)} \\\\ x_1, x_2 &\\ge 0 \\end{align*}\nThe shadow price of the caloric constraint is the value of the corresponding dual variable at the optimal solution. The dual problem (D) is:\n$$ \\text{maximize } W = 600 y_1 + 24 y_2 $$\nsubject to:\n\\begin{align*} 200 y_1 + 4 y_2 &\\le 0.50 \\\\ 100 y_1 + 10 y_2 &\\le 0.60 \\\\ y_1, y_2 &\\ge 0 \\end{align*}\nHere, $y_1$ is the dual variable for the calorie constraint, so we need to find its optimal value, $y_1^{\\star}$.\n\n**2. Solving for the Optimal Solution and Shadow Price**\n\nWe can solve the primal problem graphically. The feasible region is defined by $2x_1 + x_2 \\ge 6$ and $2x_1 + 5x_2 \\ge 12$. The optimal solution will be at one of the vertices of this region. The vertex at the intersection of the two constraint boundaries is found by solving:\n\\begin{align*} 2x_1 + x_2 &= 6 \\\\ 2x_1 + 5x_2 &= 12 \\end{align*}\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives $4x_2 = 6$, so $x_2 = 1.5$. Substituting back gives $2x_1 + 1.5 = 6$, so $2x_1 = 4.5$ and $x_1 = 2.25$. This vertex is $(x_1^{\\star}, x_2^{\\star}) = (2.25, 1.5)$. Evaluating the cost at this and other vertices confirms it is the minimum.\n\nAt this optimal primal solution, $x_1^{\\star} > 0$ and $x_2^{\\star} > 0$. By the KKT conditions (specifically, complementary slackness for LPs), the corresponding dual constraints must be binding:\n\\begin{align*} 200 y_1^{\\star} + 4 y_2^{\\star} &= 0.50 \\\\ 100 y_1^{\\star} + 10 y_2^{\\star} &= 0.60 \\end{align*}\nSolving this system of two linear equations, we multiply the second equation by 2 to get $200y_1^{\\star} + 20y_2^{\\star} = 1.20$. Subtracting the first equation from this yields $16y_2^{\\star} = 0.70$, so $y_2^{\\star} = 0.70/16 = 0.04375$. Substituting this back into the second equation: $100y_1^{\\star} + 10(0.04375) = 0.60$, which simplifies to $100y_1^{\\star} = 0.1625$.\nThis gives the shadow price for the caloric constraint:\n$$ y_1^{\\star} = 0.001625 $$\nThe value is $\\$0.001625$ per calorie.\n\n**3. Qualitative Analysis of Substitution**\n\nNow, consider increasing the caloric requirement by $10\\%$ to $b_{\\text{cal}}' = 660$. The new system of binding constraints is:\n\\begin{align*} 200 x_1 + 100 x_2 &= 660 \\\\ 4 x_1 + 10 x_2 &= 24 \\end{align*}\nDividing by $100$ and $2$ respectively simplifies this to $2x_1 + x_2 = 6.6$ and $2x_1 + 5x_2 = 12$. Solving this system gives the new optimal solution $(x_1', x_2') = (2.625, 1.35)$.\n\nComparing the new optimal quantities with the original ones:\n- Rice servings ($x_1$) increased from $2.25$ to $2.625$.\n- Beans servings ($x_2$) decreased from $1.5$ to $1.35$.\n\nTo meet the higher caloric requirement most cheaply, the optimal diet increases the consumption of rice (the more efficient source of calories per dollar) and reduces the consumption of beans. This demonstrates that the two foods act as **substitutes** in the context of this optimization problem; an increased requirement for one nutritional attribute (calories) is met by substituting one food for another to maintain the other constraint (protein) while still minimizing cost.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.001625}\n$$", "id": "3179183"}, {"introduction": "While graphical and algebraic methods build intuition, the simplex method offers a systematic tool for sensitivity analysis.
