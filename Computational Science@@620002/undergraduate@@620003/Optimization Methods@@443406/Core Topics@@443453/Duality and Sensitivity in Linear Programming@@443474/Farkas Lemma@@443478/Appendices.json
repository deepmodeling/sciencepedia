It is a standard exercise in convex analysis.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe first task is to determine whether the vector $b$ belongs to the cone $\\mathcal{K}$. By definition, $b \\in \\mathcal{K}$ if and only if there exist non-negative scalars $\\alpha \\ge 0$ and $\\beta \\ge 0$ such that $b = \\alpha a_{1} + \\beta a_{2}$. We set up the corresponding system of linear equations:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\alpha \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\beta \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis vector equation is equivalent to the system:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\alpha + \\beta = 0 \\\\\n2\\beta = 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nSolving this system, the second equation gives $\\beta = \\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting this value into the first equation, we find $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha + \\frac{1}{2} = 0 \\implies \\alpha = -\\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe solution is $(\\alpha, \\beta) = (-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$. Since $\\alpha = -\\frac{1}{2}$ is negative, the condition that both scalars must be non-negative is not met. Therefore, we conclude that $b \\notin \\mathcal{K}$.\n\nThe second task is to find a separating vector $y = \\begin{pmatrix} y_{1} \\\\ y_{2} \\end{pmatrix}$ based on the alternative provided by Farkas' lemma, along with several additional constraints for uniqueness. The conditions are:\n1. $A^{\\top} y \\ge 0$ (The vector $y$ defines a half-space that contains the cone $\\mathcal{K}$)\n2. $y^{\\top} b  0$ (The vector $b$ is in the opposite open half-space)\n3. $y^{\\top} a_{2} = 0$ (The separating hyperplane is a supporting hyperplane that contains the ray generated by $a_{2}$)\n4. $\\|y\\|_{2} = 1$ (The vector $y$ is a unit vector)\n5. $y_{1}  0$ (A condition to ensure uniqueness)\n\nLet's translate these conditions into algebraic expressions involving $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$.\n\nCondition 1: $A^{\\top} y \\ge 0$\n$$\nA^{\\top} y = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 1  2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} y_{1} \\\\ y_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} y_{1} \\\\ y_{1} + 2y_{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\ge \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis gives two inequalities:\n(i) $y^{\\top}a_1 = y_{1} \\ge 0$\n(ii) $y^{\\top}a_2 = y_{1} + 2y_{2} \\ge 0$\n\nCondition 2: $y^{\\top} b  0$\n$$\ny^{\\top} b = \\begin{pmatrix} y_{1}  y_{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = y_{2}  0\n$$\n(iii) $y_{2}  0$\n\nCondition 3: $y^{\\top} a_{2} = 0$\nThis condition makes inequality (ii) an equality:\n(iv) $y_{1} + 2y_{2} = 0$\n\nCondition 4: $\\|y\\|_{2} = 1$\n(v) $y_{1}^{2} + y_{2}^{2} = 1$\n\nCondition 5: $y_{1}  0$\n(vi) $y_{1}  0$\n\nNow we solve this system of equations and inequalities. From (iv), we have $y_{1} = -2y_{2}$.\nWe substitute this into the normalization equation (v):\n$$\n(-2y_{2})^{2} + y_{2}^{2} = 1 \\\\\n4y_{2}^{2} + y_{2}^{2} = 1 \\\\\n5y_{2}^{2} = 1 \\\\\ny_{2}^{2} = \\frac{1}{5}\n$$\nThis implies $y_{2} = \\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}$. From condition (iii), we must have $y_{2}  0$, so we choose the negative root:\n$$\ny_{2} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}\n$$\nNow we find $y_{1}$ using $y_{1} = -2y_{2}$:\n$$\ny_{1} = -2 \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}\\right) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}\n$$\nLet's verify that this solution satisfies all remaining conditions.\n- Condition (vi): $y_{1} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}  0$. This holds.\n- Condition (i): $y_{1} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} \\ge 0$. This holds.\n- The conditions $A^{\\top}y \\ge 0$ and $y^{\\top}b  0$ that are guaranteed by Farkas' lemma are satisfied. All additional constraints are also satisfied.\nThe unique vector $y$ is therefore:\n$$\ny = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe third task is to provide a geometric description.\nThe separating line is the set of all points $z = \\begin{pmatrix} z_{1} \\\\ z_{2} \\end{pmatrix}$ in the plane such that $y^{\\top} z = 0$.\n$$\n\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} z_{1} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} z_{2} = 0 \\implies 2z_{1} - z_{2} = 0 \\implies z_{2} = 2z_{1}\n$$\nThis is the line passing through the origin $(0,0)$ and the point $(1,2)$, which is precisely the vector $a_{2}$. Thus, the separating line is the line containing the extreme ray of the cone $\\mathcal{K}$ generated by $a_{2}$.\n\nThe cone $\\mathcal{K}$ is defined by non-negative linear combinations of $a_{1} = (1,0)$ and $a_{2} = (1,2)$. It occupies the sector between the positive $x$-axis and the ray $z_2 = 2 z_1$ in the first quadrant.\n- For any point $z \\in \\mathcal{K}$, $z = \\alpha a_{1} + \\beta a_{2}$ with $\\alpha, \\beta \\ge 0$.\n- $y^{\\top} z = y^{\\top}(\\alpha a_{1} + \\beta a_{2}) = \\alpha (y^{\\top} a_{1}) + \\beta (y^{\\top} a_{2})$.\n- We have $y^{\\top} a_{1} = y_1 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}  0$ and $y^{\\top} a_{2} = 0$.\n- So, $y^{\\top} z = \\alpha \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} \\ge 0$ for any $z \\in \\mathcal{K}$. This means the entire cone $\\mathcal{K}$ lies in the closed half-plane $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : y^{\\top} z \\ge 0\\}$.\n\nThe vector $b = (0,1)$ lies on the positive $y$-axis.\n- We check which side of the line $b$ is on: $y^{\\top} b = y_{2} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}  0$.\n- This shows that $b$ lies strictly in the open half-plane $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : y^{\\top} z  0\\}$.\n\nGeometrically, the line $z_{2}=2z_{1}$ is one of the boundaries of the cone $\\mathcal{K}$. This line acts as a supporting hyperplane for the cone, touching it along one of its edges. The vector $y$ is normal to this line. The cone $\\mathcal{K}$ lies entirely on one side of this line (the \"positive\" side, $y^{\\top}z \\ge 0$), while the vector $b$ is strictly on the other side (the \"negative\" side, $y^{\\top}z  0$), thus demonstrating the separation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}  -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3127944"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the geometric intuition from the previous practice, this exercise hones your ability to construct a Farkas certificate through algebraic manipulation.

The problem provides a well-defined matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times 3}$, a vector $b \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, and states Farkas' Lemma, a fundamental theorem in the theory of linear inequalities. The tasks are specific, mathematically sound, and logically connected, concerning the feasibility of a linear system under non-negativity constraints. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and scientifically grounded in the field of optimization theory. It is therefore deemed valid and we may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe given matrix $A$ and vector $b$ are:\n$$\nA \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n1  -1  0 \\\\\n0  \\phantom{-}0  1\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\qquad\nb \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\nThe first task is to verify that $A$ has full row rank. The matrix $A$ has $2$ rows. Full row rank requires that the rank of $A$ is $2$. We can determine the rank by checking for linear independence of the rows. Let the rows of $A$ be $r_1 = (1, -1, 0)$ and $r_2 = (0, 0, 1)$. We form a linear combination and set it to the zero vector: $c_1 r_1 + c_2 r_2 = \\mathbf{0}$ for scalars $c_1, c_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n$$ c_1 (1, -1, 0) + c_2 (0, 0, 1) = (c_1, -c_1, c_2) = (0, 0, 0) $$\nThis vector equation implies $c_1 = 0$ and $c_2 = 0$. Since the only solution is the trivial one ($c_1=c_2=0$), the rows $r_1$ and $r_2$ are linearly independent. Therefore, the rank of $A$ is $2$, which is equal to the number of rows, so $A$ has full row rank.\n\nThe second task is to characterize the cone $C = \\{Ax : x \\ge 0\\}$. Let $x = (x_1, x_2, x_3)^\\top$ be a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with non-negative components, i.e., $x_1 \\ge 0$, $x_2 \\ge 0$, and $x_3 \\ge 0$. A vector $v = (v_1, v_2)^\\top \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ belongs to the cone $C$ if it can be expressed as $v = Ax$ for some such $x$.\n$$ v = Ax = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 - x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe components of $v$ are $v_1 = x_1 - x_2$ and $v_2 = x_3$.\nSince $x_3 \\ge 0$, the second component of $v$ must be non-negative: $v_2 \\ge 0$.\nFor the first component, $v_1 = x_1 - x_2$, since $x_1$ and $x_2$ can be any non-negative real numbers, their difference $x_1-x_2$ can assume any real value. For any arbitrary $k \\in \\mathbb{R}$, if $k \\ge 0$, we can choose $x_1 = k$ and $x_2 = 0$. If $k  0$, we can choose $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = -k  0$. In either case, we can find non-negative $x_1, x_2$ such that $x_1 - x_2 = k$. Thus, $v_1$ is unconstrained.\nThe cone $C$ is the set of all vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ whose second component is non-negative:\n$$ C = \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid v_2 \\ge 0 \\right\\} $$\nThis set represents the upper half-plane of $\\mathbb{R}^2$, including the horizontal axis.\n\nNext, we decide whether the vector $b = (0, -1)^\\top$ lies in this cone $C$. For a vector to be in $C$, its second component must be greater than or equal to $0$. The second component of $b$ is $b_2 = -1$. Since $-1  0$, the condition is not met. Therefore, $b$ does not lie in the cone $C$. This implies that there is no solution $x \\ge 0$ to the system $Ax = b$.\n\nAccording to the provided statement of Farkas’ Lemma, exactly one of the following systems has a solution:\n(i) there exists $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with $x \\ge 0$ and $A x = b$; or\n(ii) there exists $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with $A^{\\top} y \\ge 0$ and $b^{\\top} y  0$.\nWe have just proven that system (i) has no solution. Consequently, system (ii) must have a solution. This establishes the existence of a certificate vector $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ satisfying the conditions in (ii).\n\nWe now explicitly construct such a certificate $y = (y_1, y_2)^\\top$. The conditions are $A^\\top y \\ge 0$ and $b^\\top y  0$.\nThe transpose of $A$ is $A^\\top = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ -1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe first condition, $A^\\top y \\ge 0$, becomes:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ -1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ -y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\end{pmatrix} \\ge \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis gives three component-wise inequalities:\n1. $y_1 \\ge 0$\n2. $-y_1 \\ge 0 \\implies y_1 \\le 0$\n3. $y_2 \\ge 0$\nInequalities (1) and (2) together imply that $y_1 = 0$. Inequality (3) requires $y_2 \\ge 0$.\nThe second condition is $b^\\top y  0$:\n$$ b^\\top y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\end{pmatrix} = -y_2  0 $$\nThis implies $y_2  0$.\nCombining all constraints on $y$, we find that $y_1 = 0$ and $y_2  0$. Any vector of the form $y = (0, c)^\\top$ with $c  0$ is a valid certificate. For simplicity, we can choose $c=1$, which gives the certificate $y_c = (0, 1)^\\top$.\n\nThe next task is to normalize the certificate to have a Euclidean norm of $1$. Let's consider a general certificate $y = (0, c)^\\top$ where $c  0$. Its Euclidean norm is $\\|y\\|_2 = \\sqrt{0^2 + c^2} = \\sqrt{c^2} = c$.\nThe normalized certificate, $\\hat{y}$, is obtained by dividing $y$ by its norm:\n$$ \\hat{y} = \\frac{y}{\\|y\\|_2} = \\frac{1}{c} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ c \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe resulting normalized certificate is unique. We check its norm: $\\|\\hat{y}\\|_2 = \\sqrt{0^2 + 1^2} = 1$.\n\nFinally, we compute the value of $b^\\top \\hat{y}$ using the normalized certificate $\\hat{y} = (0, 1)^\\top$:\n$$ b^\\top \\hat{y} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = (0)(0) + (-1)(1) = -1 $$\nThis is the final required value.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1}$$", "id": "3118176"}, {"introduction": "A Farkas certificate does more than just confirm that a system is infeasible; it can act as a powerful diagnostic tool, pinpointing the specific constraints that cause the conflict.

It is a well-posed mathematical problem within the field of optimization methods, specifically concerning the feasibility of a system of linear equations with non-negativity constraints. All provided data, including the matrix $A$ and vector $b$, are clearly defined, and the tasks are specified without ambiguity. The problem is self-contained and free of scientific or factual unsoundness. It requires an understanding of linear systems and the fundamental theorem of alternatives, Farkas' lemma.\n\nWe are given the set $X=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\mid Ax=b,\\ x\\ge 0\\}$, with the matrix $A$ and vector $b$ defined as:\n$$\nA=\\begin{pmatrix}\n1  1\\\\\n1  0\\\\\n0  1\n\\end{pmatrix},\\qquad\nb=\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1\\\\\n2\\\\\n3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe vector $x$ is in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, so we denote its components as $x = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFirst, we assess whether the set $X$ is empty. The condition $Ax=b$ translates to the following system of linear equations:\n1. $x_1 + x_2 = -1$\n2. $x_1 = 2$\n3. $x_2 = 3$\n\nThe condition $x \\ge 0$ means that both components of $x$ must be non-negative, i.e., $x_1 \\ge 0$ and $x_2 \\ge 0$.\nThe problem asks to reason about the sign structure. The non-negativity constraints $x_1 \\ge 0$ and $x_2 \\ge 0$ directly imply that their sum must also be non-negative: $x_1 + x_2 \\ge 0$. However, the first equation of the system is $x_1 + x_2 = -1$. A non-negative quantity cannot be equal to a strictly negative number. This is a contradiction. Therefore, there is no vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ that can satisfy both $x_1 + x_2 = -1$ and $x \\ge 0$. As a result, the feasible set $X$ is empty.\nAlternatively, one could substitute the values from the second and third equations, $x_1=2$ and $x_2=3$, into the first equation. This yields $2+3=5$. The first equation requires this sum to be $-1$. The statement $5=-1$ is a contradiction, which again shows that the system of equations $Ax=b$ has no solution, and thus $X$ is empty.\n\nSecond, we drop the first equality constraint, which corresponds to the first row of $A$ and the first entry of $b$. The new system of constraints is defined by the set $X' = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid A'x=b', x \\ge 0\\}$, where:\n$$\nA'=\\begin{pmatrix}\n1  0\\\\\n0  1\n\\end{pmatrix},\\qquad\nb'=\\begin{pmatrix}\n2\\\\\n3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe system of equations $A'x=b'$ is:\n1. $x_1 = 2$\n2. $x_2 = 3$\nThis system has a unique solution $x = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$. We must also check the non-negativity constraint $x \\ge 0$. For this solution, we have $x_1=2 \\ge 0$ and $x_2=3 \\ge 0$. Since both components are non-negative, this solution is valid. Thus, the set $X'$ is non-empty, and an example of an element in $X'$ is $x = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThird, we find a certificate of infeasibility for the original system. The infeasibility of the system $Ax=b, x\\ge 0$ can be certified using Farkas' lemma. One form of Farkas' lemma states that exactly one of the following two systems has a solution:\n(I) There exists an $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that $Ax=b$ and $x \\ge 0$.\n(II) There exists a $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ such that $A^T y \\ge 0$ and $b^T y  0$.\nWe have already established that System (I) has no solution for the given $A$ and $b$. Therefore, there must exist a vector $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ that satisfies the conditions of System (II). Such a vector $y$ is called a certificate of infeasibility.\n\nLet's write out the conditions for System (II). We have $y = \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ y_3 \\end{pmatrix}$. The condition $A^T y \\ge 0$ is:\n$$\nA^T y = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  0 \\\\ 1  0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ y_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 + y_2 \\\\ y_1 + y_3 \\end{pmatrix} \\ge \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis gives two inequalities:\n1. $y_1 + y_2 \\ge 0$\n2. $y_1 + y_3 \\ge 0$\n\nThe condition $b^T y  0$ is:\n$$\nb^T y = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  2  3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ y_3 \\end{pmatrix} = -y_1 + 2y_2 + 3y_3  0\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for a certificate vector $y$ supported only on the dropped constraint, which was the first constraint. This means we should look for a solution of the form $y = \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Substituting $y_2=0$ and $y_3=0$ into the inequalities:\n1. $y_1 + 0 \\ge 0 \\implies y_1 \\ge 0$\n2. $y_1 + 0 \\ge 0 \\implies y_1 \\ge 0$\n3. $-y_1 + 2(0) + 3(0)  0 \\implies -y_1  0 \\implies y_1  0$\n\nAll three conditions must be satisfied. The condition $y_1  0$ is the most restrictive. We can choose any positive value for $y_1$. The simplest non-zero choice is $y_1=1$.\nThis gives the certificate vector $y = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nLet's verify this solution.\nFor $y = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, we have $A^T y = \\begin{pmatrix} 1+0 \\\\ 1+0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\ge \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The first condition is met.\nFor $b^T y$, we have $-1(1) + 2(0) + 3(0) = -1  0$. The second condition is also met.\nThus, the vector $y = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ is a valid certificate of infeasibility for the original system.\nThe geometric interpretation is that the hyperplane defined by $y$, which is $z_1=0$ for a point $z \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, separates the vector $b$ from the cone generated by the columns of $A$. Specifically, all points in the cone $\\{Ax \\mid x \\ge 0\\}$ satisfy $y^T(Ax) = (A^T y)^T x \\ge 0$, while $y^T b  0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3127926"}]}
