A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe optimization problem is to minimize the objective function $f(x_1, x_2) = x_1 + x_2$ subject to the inequality constraint $g(x_1, x_2) = x_1^2 - x_2 \\le 0$.\n\n**Constraint Qualification**\nBefore applying the KKT conditions, we must verify that a constraint qualification (CQ) holds. The CQ ensures that the geometry of the feasible set is well-behaved at the boundary, which guarantees that the KKT conditions are necessary for a point to be a local minimum.\n\nWe will use the Linear Independence Constraint Qualification (LICQ). For a point $x$ where a set of constraints $\\{g_i(x)=0\\}$ is active, LICQ requires that the gradients of these active constraints, $\\{\\nabla g_i(x)\\}$, are linearly independent.\n\nIn this problem, there is only one constraint, $g(x_1, x_2) = x_1^2 - x_2 \\le 0$. The gradient of the constraint function is:\n$$ \\nabla g(x_1, x_2) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x_1} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x_2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x_1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFor LICQ to fail, the set of gradients of active constraints must be linearly dependent. With a single constraint, this would mean the gradient vector is the zero vector. However, $\\nabla g(x_1, x_2)$ can never be the zero vector, as its second component is always $-1$. Thus, the gradient is non-zero for all points $(x_1, x_2)$. This means that LICQ holds for all feasible points. Since a CQ is satisfied, the KKT conditions are necessary for optimality.\n\n**Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) Conditions**\nThe Lagrangian function for this problem is:\n$$ L(x_1, x_2, \\lambda) = f(x_1, x_2) + \\lambda g(x_1, x_2) = (x_1 + x_2) + \\lambda(x_1^2 - x_2) $$\nThe KKT conditions for a candidate optimal point $(x_1^{\\star}, x_2^{\\star})$ and a corresponding Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda^{\\star}$ are:\n\n1.  **Stationarity**: The gradient of the Lagrangian with respect to $x$ must be zero.\n    $$ \\nabla_x L(x_1^{\\star}, x_2^{\\star}, \\lambda^{\\star}) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 + 2\\lambda^{\\star}x_1^{\\star} \\\\ 1 - \\lambda^{\\star} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n2.  **Primal Feasibility**: The point must satisfy the problem's constraints.\n    $$ x_1^{\\star 2} - x_2^{\\star} \\le 0 $$\n3.  **Dual Feasibility**: The Lagrange multiplier for an inequality constraint of the form $g(x) \\le 0$ must be non-negative.\n    $$ \\lambda^{\\star} \\ge 0 $$\n4.  **Complementary Slackness**: The product of the Lagrange multiplier and the constraint function must be zero.\n    $$ \\lambda^{\\star}(x_1^{\\star 2} - x_2^{\\star}) = 0 $$\n\nNow, we solve this system of equations and inequalities.\nFrom the second component of the stationarity condition (1):\n$$ 1 - \\lambda^{\\star} = 0 \\implies \\lambda^{\\star} = 1 $$\nThis value satisfies the dual feasibility condition (3), since $1 \\ge 0$.\n\nBecause $\\lambda^{\\star} = 1 \\neq 0$, the complementary slackness condition (4) requires that the constraint must be active:\n$$ x_1^{\\star 2} - x_2^{\\star} = 0 \\implies x_2^{\\star} = x_1^{\\star 2} $$\nThis result demonstrates that the optimal solution must lie on the boundary of the feasible region, which is the parabola $x_2 = x_1^2$.\n\nNow, we use the first component of the stationarity condition (1) and substitute $\\lambda^{\\star} = 1$:\n$$ 1 + 2\\lambda^{\\star}x_1^{\\star} = 0 \\implies 1 + 2(1)x_1^{\\star} = 0 \\implies 2x_1^{\\star} = -1 \\implies x_1^{\\star} = -\\frac{1}{2} $$\nUsing the relation $x_2^{\\star} = x_1^{\\star 2}$, we find $x_2^{\\star}$:\n$$ x_2^{\\star} = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} $$\nThe candidate optimal point is $(x_1^{\\star}, x_2^{\\star}) = (-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4})$ with the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda^{\\star} = 1$.\nWe must verify that this point satisfies the primal feasibility condition (2):\n$$ \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} = 0 $$\nSince $0 \\le 0$, the condition is satisfied. All KKT conditions are met.\n\n**Geometric Interpretation**\nThe KKT framework requires tangency between the level set of the objective function and the boundary of the feasible set at the optimum. This geometric condition is captured algebraically by the stationarity condition $\\nabla f(x^{\\star}) + \\lambda^{\\star} \\nabla g(x^{\\star}) = 0$, which implies $\\nabla f(x^{\\star}) = -\\lambda^{\\star} \\nabla g(x^{\\star})$. The gradients of the objective and the active constraint must be parallel.\n\nLet's verify this at our solution point $x^{\\star} = (-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4})$.\nThe gradient of the objective function is constant:\n$$ \\nabla f(x_1, x_2) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe gradient of the constraint function at the solution is:\n$$ \\nabla g(x_1^{\\star}, x_2^{\\star}) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x_1^{\\star} \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2(-\\frac{1}{2}) \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe stationarity condition requires:\n$$ \\nabla f(x^{\\star}) = -\\lambda^{\\star} \\nabla g(x^{\\star}) \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = -(1) \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis holds, confirming the gradients are parallel.\n\nAlternatively, we can compare the slopes. The level sets of the objective function are lines $x_1 + x_2 = c$, which can be written as $x_2 = -x_1 + c$. The slope of these lines is $\\frac{dx_2}{dx_1} = -1$.\nThe boundary of the feasible region is the parabola $x_2 = x_1^2$. The slope of the tangent line to this parabola is given by its derivative: $\\frac{dx_2}{dx_1} = 2x_1$.\nAt the optimal point, $x_1^{\\star} = -\\frac{1}{2}$, the slope of the tangent to the parabola is:\n$$ \\frac{dx_2}{dx_1}\\bigg|_{x_1 = -1/2} = 2\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -1 $$\nSince the slope of the objective's level set $(-1)$ is equal to the slope of the constraint boundary at the point $(-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4})$, the two curves are tangent at this point. This fulfills the geometric requirement.\n\n**Optimal Objective Value**\nThe optimal point is $(x_1^{\\star}, x_2^{\\star}) = (-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4})$. The optimal value of the objective function is:\n$$ f(x^{\\star}) = f\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4}\\right) = x_1^{\\star} + x_2^{\\star} = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = -\\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = -\\frac{1}{4} $$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-\\frac{1}{4}} $$", "id": "3140454"}, {"introduction": "The necessity of KKT conditions for optimality is guaranteed only when certain regularity conditions, known as constraint qualifications (CQs), are met.

Identify the Optimizer**\n\nThe objective function $f(x_1, x_2) = (x_1 - 2)^2 + x_2^2$ represents the squared Euclidean distance from the point $(2, 0)$ to a point $(x_1, x_2)$. The constraints are $x_1 \\le 1$ and $2x_1 \\le 2$, which both define the same feasible region: the closed half-plane $\\mathcal{F} = \\{ (x_1, x_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x_1 \\le 1 \\}$.\n\nThe problem is equivalent to finding the point in $\\mathcal{F}$ that is closest to $(2, 0)$. Geometrically, the point $(2, 0)$ lies outside the feasible region to the right of the boundary line $x_1 = 1$. The closest point in the feasible region to an external point is the orthogonal projection of the external point onto the boundary of the feasible set. The orthogonal projection of $(2, 0)$ onto the line $x_1 = 1$ is the point $(1, 0)$.\n\nTherefore, the unique optimizer is $x^\\star = (1, 0)$.\n\n**2. Formulate and Analyze KKT Conditions for the Original Problem**\n\nThe standard form for inequality constraints is $g_i(x) \\le 0$.\n- $g_1(x) = x_1 - 1 \\le 0$.\n- $g_2(x) = 2x_1 - 2 \\le 0$.\n\nThe Lagrangian function is given by:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(x, \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2) = f(x) + \\lambda_1 g_1(x) + \\lambda_2 g_2(x) $$\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(x_1, x_2, \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2) = (x_1 - 2)^2 + x_2^2 + \\lambda_1(x_1 - 1) + \\lambda_2(2x_1 - 2) $$\n\nThe KKT necessary conditions at a local minimum $x^\\star$ are:\n1.  **Stationarity:** $\\nabla_x \\mathcal{L}(x^\\star, \\lambda^\\star) = 0$.\n2.  **Primal Feasibility:** $g_1(x^\\star) \\le 0$, $g_2(x^\\star) \\le 0$.\n3.  **Dual Feasibility:** $\\lambda_1^\\star \\ge 0$, $\\lambda_2^\\star \\ge 0$.\n4.  **Complementary Slackness:** $\\lambda_1^\\star g_1(x^\\star) = 0$, $\\lambda_2^\\star g_2(x^\\star) = 0$.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions at the candidate optimizer $x^\\star = (1, 0)$.\n\n- **Primal Feasibility:**\n  - $g_1(1, 0) = 1 - 1 = 0$. The constraint holds.\n  - $g_2(1, 0) = 2(1) - 2 = 0$. The constraint holds.\n  Since $g_1(x^\\star) = 0$ and $g_2(x^\\star) = 0$, both constraints are **active** at the optimizer.\n\n- **Complementary Slackness:**\n  - $\\lambda_1 g_1(x^\\star) = \\lambda_1 \\cdot 0 = 0$. This is satisfied for any $\\lambda_1$.\n  - $\\lambda_2 g_2(x^\\star) = \\lambda_2 \\cdot 0 = 0$. This is satisfied for any $\\lambda_2$.\n  These conditions impose no restriction on the multipliers.\n\n- **Stationarity:**\n  The gradient of the Lagrangian with respect to $x$ is:\n  $$ \\nabla_x \\mathcal{L} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x_1} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x_2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2(x_1 - 2) + \\lambda_1 + 2\\lambda_2 \\\\ 2x_2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n  Setting $\\nabla_x \\mathcal{L} = 0$ at $x^\\star = (1, 0)$:\n  $$ \\begin{pmatrix} 2(1 - 2) + \\lambda_1 + 2\\lambda_2 \\\\ 2(0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n  This gives two equations:\n  1.  $-2 + \\lambda_1 + 2\\lambda_2 = 0 \\implies \\lambda_1 + 2\\lambda_2 = 2$.\n  2.  $0 = 0$.\n\n- **Dual Feasibility:**\n  We must have $\\lambda_1 \\ge 0$ and $\\lambda_2 \\ge 0$.\n\nCombining the conditions, for $x^\\star = (1, 0)$ to be a KKT point, there must exist Lagrange multipliers $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)$ satisfying:\n- $\\lambda_1 + 2\\lambda_2 = 2$\n- $\\lambda_1 \\ge 0$\n- $\\lambda_2 \\ge 0$\n\nThis system defines a line segment in the $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)$-plane with endpoints at $(2, 0)$ (when $\\lambda_2=0$) and $(0, 1)$ (when $\\lambda_1=0$). Since there is more than one pair $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)$ that satisfies these conditions, the KKT multipliers are **not unique**.\n\n**3. Analyze Constraint Qualifications**\n\nThe Linear Independence Constraint Qualification (LICQ) requires the gradients of the active constraints at the point $x^\\star$ to be linearly independent.\nAt $x^\\star = (1, 0)$, both constraints are active. Their gradients are:\n- $\\nabla g_1(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- $\\nabla g_2(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThese two vectors are linearly dependent, since $\\nabla g_2(x) = 2 \\nabla g_1(x)$. Therefore, LICQ **does not hold** at the optimizer $x^\\star$. The failure of LICQ is the reason the KKT multipliers are not unique.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The unique optimizer is $x^\\star = (1, 0)$.**\nAs determined by the geometric argument of minimizing the distance from $(2, 0)$ to the half-plane $x_1 \\le 1$, the minimizer is indeed $x^\\star=(1,0)$. Since the objective function $f(x)$ is strictly convex and the feasible set is convex, this optimizer is unique.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. At $x^\\star$, both constraints are active and the Linear Independence Constraint Qualification (LICQ) holds.**\nWe found that at $x^\\star = (1, 0)$, both $g_1(x^\\star) = 0$ and $g_2(x^\\star) = 0$, so both constraints are active. However, we also showed that the gradients of these active constraints, $\\nabla g_1 = (1, 0)^T$ and $\\nabla g_2 = (2, 0)^T$, are linearly dependent. Thus, LICQ fails to hold. The statement is a conjunction, and since the second part is false, the entire statement is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The KKT multipliers associated with $g_1(x)$ and $g_2(x)$ are not unique; all pairs $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)$ with $\\lambda_1 \\ge 0$, $\\lambda_2 \\ge 0$, and $\\lambda_1 + 2\\lambda_2 = 2$ satisfy the KKT stationarity and complementary slackness at $x^\\star$.**\nOur analysis of the KKT conditions at $x^\\star = (1, 0)$ led precisely to the conditions $\\lambda_1 + 2\\lambda_2 = 2$, $\\lambda_1 \\ge 0$, and $\\lambda_2 \\ge 0$. Any pair $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)$ satisfying these conditions is a valid set of KKT multipliers. This set represents a line segment and is therefore not a unique point. The statement accurately describes the set of valid multipliers.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. KKT complementary slackness forces either $\\lambda_1 = 0$ or $\\lambda_2 = 0$ for any solution, thereby directly identifying that one constraint is redundant.**\nThe complementary slackness conditions are $\\lambda_1 g_1(x^\\star) = 0$ and $\\lambda_2 g_2(x^\\star) = 0$. Since both constraints are active ($g_1(x^\\star) = 0$ and $g_2(x^\\star) = 0$), these equations become $\\lambda_1 \\cdot 0 = 0$ and $\\lambda_2 \\cdot 0 = 0$. These are satisfied for any values of $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ and impose no restrictions on them. It is not true that either $\\lambda_1=0$ or $\\lambda_2=0$ must hold. For example, from option C, we can choose $\\lambda_2 = 0.5$, which gives $\\lambda_1 = 1$. The pair $(1, 0.5)$ is a valid set of multipliers where both are strictly positive. Therefore, complementary slackness does not force either multiplier to be zero.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. If the redundant constraint $g_2(x)$ is removed and only $g_1(x)$ is kept, LICQ holds at the optimizer and the corresponding single KKT multiplier is unique.**\nLet's analyze the simplified problem: minimize $f(x)$ subject to $g_1(x) = x_1 - 1 \\le 0$.\nThe optimizer remains $x^\\star = (1, 0)$. At this point, the single constraint $g_1(x)$ is active.\n- **LICQ:** The set of active constraint gradients consists of the single vector $\\nabla g_1(x^\\star) = (1, 0)^T$. A set containing one non-zero vector is always linearly independent. So, LICQ holds.\n- **KKT Multiplier:** The Lagrangian is $\\mathcal{L}(x, \\mu_1) = (x_1 - 2)^2 + x_2^2 + \\mu_1(x_1 - 1)$. The stationarity condition is $\\nabla_x \\mathcal{L}(x^\\star, \\mu_1) = 0$.\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 2(1 - 2) + \\mu_1 \\\\ 2(0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 + \\mu_1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis gives $-2 + \\mu_1 = 0$, so $\\mu_1 = 2$. This is a unique value. We also check dual feasibility: $\\mu_1 = 2 \\ge 0$, which is satisfied.\nSince LICQ holds, the KKT multiplier is guaranteed to be unique. Our calculation confirms this uniqueness.

These conditions are stationarity and primal feasibility.\n\nFirst, we define the Lagrangian function $\\mathcal{L}(x, y, \\lambda)$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(x, y, \\lambda) = f(x,y) + \\lambda h(x,y) = (x^{2} + y^{4} - 2 y^{2}) + \\lambda(x + y)\n$$\n\nThe KKT conditions are:\n- **Stationarity:** The gradient of the Lagrangian with respect to the decision variables $(x, y)$ must be the zero vector.\n$$\n\\nabla_{x,y} \\mathcal{L}(x, y, \\lambda) = 0\n$$\n- **Primal Feasibility:** The point $(x, y)$ must satisfy the original constraints.\n$$\nh(x,y) = 0\n$$\n\nLet's write these conditions explicitly for the given problem.\n\nThe partial derivatives of the Lagrangian are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x} = 2x + \\lambda = 0 \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y} = 4y^{3} - 4y + \\lambda = 0 \\quad (2)\n$$\n\nThe primal feasibility condition is:\n$$\nx + y = 0 \\quad (3)\n$$\n\nWe now solve this system of three equations for $x$, $y$, and $\\lambda$.\nFrom (3), we have $x = -y$.\nSubstituting $x = -y$ into (1) gives $\\lambda = -2x = -2(-y) = 2y$.\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\lambda$ into (2):\n$$\n4y^{3} - 4y + (2y) = 0\n$$\n$$\n4y^{3} - 2y = 0\n$$\n$$\n2y(2y^{2} - 1) = 0\n$$\nThis equation yields three possible solutions for $y$:\n- $y = 0$\n- $2y^{2} - 1 = 0 \\implies y^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies y = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$\n\nFor each value of $y$, we find the corresponding $x$ and $\\lambda$ to identify the KKT points $(x, y, \\lambda)$.\n\n- **Case 1: $y_1 = 0$**\n  - $x_1 = -y_1 = 0$\n  - $\\lambda_1 = 2y_1 = 0$\n  - The first KKT point is $(x_1, y_1) = (0, 0)$ with multiplier $\\lambda_1 = 0$.\n\n- **Case 2: $y_2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$**\n  - $x_2 = -y_2 = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$\n  - $\\lambda_2 = 2y_2 = 2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = \\sqrt{2}$\n  - The second KKT point is $(x_2, y_2) = (-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})$ with multiplier $\\lambda_2 = \\sqrt{2}$.\n\n- **Case 3: $y_3 = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$**\n  - $x_3 = -y_3 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$\n  - $\\lambda_3 = 2y_3 = 2\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = -\\sqrt{2}$\n  - The third KKT point is $(x_3, y_3) = (\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})$ with multiplier $\\lambda_3 = -\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nWe have found three KKT points: $(0, 0)$, $(-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})$, and $(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})$.\n\n**2. Second-Order Analysis**\n\nTo classify these stationary points, we use the second-order necessary and sufficient conditions. For a KKT point $(x^\\star, \\lambda^\\star)$ to be a local minimum, the Hessian of the Lagrangian with respect to the decision variables, $\\nabla^2_{x,y} \\mathcal{L}(x^\\star, \\lambda^\\star)$, must be positive semidefinite on the tangent space of the constraints at $x^\\star$. That is, $d^T \\nabla^2_{x,y} \\mathcal{L}(x^\\star, \\lambda^\\star) d \\geq 0$ for all feasible directions $d$. If the inequality is strict ($>0$) for all non-zero feasible directions, the point is a strict local minimum.\n\nFirst, we find the tangent space. The constraint is $h(x,y) = x+y=0$. The gradient of the constraint is $\\nabla h(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The tangent space at any feasible point is the set of vectors $d = \\begin{pmatrix} d_x \\\\ d_y \\end{pmatrix}$ such that $\\nabla h(x,y)^T d = 0$.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} d_x \\\\ d_y \\end{pmatrix} = d_x + d_y = 0\n$$\nThis implies $d_y = -d_x$. Thus, any feasible direction vector $d$ is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. We can choose $d = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ as a basis vector for the tangent space.\n\nNext, we calculate the Hessian of the Lagrangian, $\\nabla^2_{x,y} \\mathcal{L}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x^2} = 2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y \\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y^2} = 12y^{2} - 4\n$$\nThe Hessian matrix is:\n$$\n\\nabla^2_{x,y} \\mathcal{L}(x,y,\\lambda) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  0 \\\\ 0  12y^{2} - 4 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNote that the Hessian depends only on $y$. We now evaluate the quadratic form $d^T \\nabla^2_{x,y} \\mathcal{L} d$ for $d = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ at each KKT point.\n$$\nd^T \\nabla^2_{x,y} \\mathcal{L} d = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2  0 \\\\ 0  12y^{2} - 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = 2(1)^2 + (12y^{2} - 4)(-1)^2 = 2 + 12y^{2} - 4 = 12y^{2} - 2\n$$\n\nNow we test each KKT point:\n- **For point $(0, 0)$:**\n  Here $y=0$. The value of the quadratic form is $12(0)^2 - 2 = -2$. Since $-2  0$, the point $(0,0)$ is a **local maximum**.\n\n- **For point $(-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})$:**\n  Here $y = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, so $y^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$. The value of the quadratic form is $12(\\frac{1}{2}) - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4$. Since $4 > 0$, the point $(-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})$ is a **strict local minimum**.\n\n- **For point $(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})$:**\n  Here $y = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, so $y^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$. The value of the quadratic form is $12(\\frac{1}{2}) - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4$. Since $4 > 0$, the point $(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})$ is also a **strict local minimum**.\n\n**3. Lowest Objective Value**\n\nThe problem asks for the lowest objective value attained among all local minima. We have two such points. We evaluate the objective function $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^4 - 2y^2$ at each of them.\n\n- At $(x,y) = (-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})$:\n  $x^2 = (-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$\n  $y^2 = (\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$\n  $y^4 = (\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$\n  $f(-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} - 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} - 1 = \\frac{3}{4} - 1 = -\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n- At $(x,y) = (\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})$:\n  $x^2 = (\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$\n  $y^2 = (-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$\n  $y^4 = (\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$\n  $f(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} - 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} - 1 = \\frac{3}{4} - 1 = -\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nBoth local minima yield the same objective value of $-\\frac{1}{4}$. Therefore, the lowest objective value attained among all local minima is $-\\frac{1}{4}$.\nSince the feasible set $x+y=0$ is unbounded, we must consider if the function is unbounded below on this set. Substituting $x=-y$ into $f(x,y)$ gives the objective value as a function of $y$: $h(y) = (-y)^2 + y^4 - 2y^2 = y^4 - y^2$. As $y \\to \\pm \\infty$, $h(y) \\to +\\infty$. So the function is bounded below, and the value we found, $-\\frac{1}{4}$, is the global minimum value.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{4}}\n$$", "id": "3140538"}]}
