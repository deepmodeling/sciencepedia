It is self-contained, with all necessary information provided. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires us to demonstrate that Slater's condition holds for the given convex optimization problem. For a problem with convex inequality constraints $f_i(x) \\leq 0, i=1, \\dots, m$ and affine equality constraints $h_j(x) = 0, j=1, \\dots, p$, Slater's condition is satisfied if there exists a feasible point $x_{slater}$ that is strictly feasible for the non-affine inequality constraints. In this specific problem, there are no equality constraints and the single inequality constraint is convex and not affine. Therefore, to verify Slater's condition, we must find a point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ such that the constraint is satisfied with strict inequality.\n\nLet $x = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix}$. We first compute the inner products in the exponents:\n$a_{1}^{\\top}x = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix} = x_1$\n$a_{2}^{\\top}x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix} = x_2$\n$a_{3}^{\\top}x = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix} = x_1 + x_2$\n\nSubstituting these into the strict inequality gives:\n$$\n\\exp(x_1) + \\exp(x_2) + \\exp(x_1 + x_2)  1\n$$\n\nOur task is to find a specific pair of values $(x_1, x_2)$ that satisfies this condition. The exponential function $\\exp(z)$ is always positive. To make the sum of three positive terms less than $1$, the terms themselves must be sufficiently small. The value of $\\exp(z)$ becomes small as $z$ becomes a large negative number. This suggests that we should search for a solution where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are negative.\n\nLet's consider a symmetric case where $x_1 = x_2 = y$ for some real number $y$. The inequality becomes:\n$$\n\\exp(y) + \\exp(y) + \\exp(y + y)  1\n$$\n$$\n2\\exp(y) + \\exp(2y)  1\n$$\n\nWe need to choose a value for $y$ such that this inequality holds. Let's try an integer value for simplicity. If we choose $y$ to be negative, $\\exp(y)$ will be less than $1$. Let's test the point where $y = -2$. This means we propose the point $x = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nWe check if this point satisfies the strict inequality:\n$$\n\\exp(-2) + \\exp(-2) + \\exp(-2 + (-2))  1\n$$\n$$\n2\\exp(-2) + \\exp(-4)  1\n$$\nTo verify this inequality without a calculator, we can recall that the base of the natural logarithm, $e$, is approximately $2.718$. Since $e  2$, it follows that $e^2  4$ and $e^4  16$.\nLet's evaluate the left-hand side (LHS):\n$$\n\\text{LHS} = 2\\exp(-2) + \\exp(-4) = \\frac{2}{e^2} + \\frac{1}{e^4}\n$$\nUsing our bounds:\n$$\n\\text{LHS}  \\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{9}{16}\n$$\nSince $\\frac{9}{16}  1$, the inequality $2\\exp(-2) + \\exp(-4)  1$ is satisfied.\n\nThus, the point $x = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$ is strictly feasible. The existence of such a point demonstrates that Slater's condition is satisfied for this optimization problem.\n\nThe problem asks for one explicit such point, which we have found.

It is a well-structured question that tests fundamental concepts in optimization theory. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem asks for an analysis of two convex optimization problems, (P0) and (P1), concerning Slater's condition and the application of an interior-point method. Finally, it requests the optimal objective value for (P0). We begin by formally defining the core concepts.\n\nA general convex optimization problem is of the form $\\min f_0(x)$ subject to $f_i(x) \\le 0$ for $i=1, \\dots, m$ and $h_j(x)=0$ for $j=1, \\dots, p$, where the functions $f_0, \\dots, f_m$ are convex and $h_1, \\dots, h_p$ are affine. The feasible set is the set of all points $x$ satisfying the constraints.\n\n**Part 1: Slater's Condition for (P0)**\nFor problem (P0), the constraints are $g_1(x) = -x_1 \\le 0$, $g_2(x) = -x_2 \\le 0$, and $h_1(x) = x_1 + x_2 - 1 = 0$.\nSlater's condition requires the existence of a feasible point $x_{slater}$ that satisfies all inequality constraints strictly. Such a point is often called a \"strictly feasible point.\" Formally, we seek a point $x = (x_1, x_2)$ such that:\n1.  $h_1(x) = x_1 + x_2 - 1 = 0$ (Equality constraint is met)\n2.  $g_1(x) = -x_1  0 \\implies x_1  0$ (Inequality 1 is strictly met)\n3.  $g_2(x) = -x_2  0 \\implies x_2  0$ (Inequality 2 is strictly met)\n\nWe must determine if the set of points satisfying these three conditions is non-empty. Consider the point $x = (1/2, 1/2)$.\n-   $x_1 + x_2 = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1$, so the equality constraint is satisfied.\n-   $x_1 = 1/2  0$, so the first inequality is strictly satisfied.\n-   $x_2 = 1/2  0$, so the second inequality is strictly satisfied.\nSince at least one such point exists, **Slater's condition holds for (P0)**. The existence of a strictly feasible point guarantees strong duality for this convex problem.\n\n**Part 2: Analysis of Problem (P1)**\nProblem (P1) adds the constraint $g_3(x) = x_1 + x_2 - 1 \\le 0$ to (P0).\n\n-   **Redundancy:** A constraint is redundant if removing it does not change the feasible set. The feasible set of (P0) is $S_0 = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x_1+x_2 = 1, x_1 \\ge 0, x_2 \\ge 0\\}$. For any point $x \\in S_0$, the equality $x_1+x_2=1$ holds. This immediately implies that the inequality $x_1+x_2 \\le 1$ is also satisfied. Therefore, adding this constraint does not remove any points from the feasible set. The feasible set of (P1) is identical to $S_0$. The constraint $x_1 + x_2 \\le 1$ is **redundant**.\n\n-   **Tightness:** A constraint $g(x) \\le 0$ is tight on a feasible set $S$ if $g(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in S$. For any feasible point $x \\in S_0$, we have $x_1 + x_2 = 1$. This is equivalent to $x_1 + x_2 - 1 = 0$. This means the constraint function $g_3(x)=x_1+x_2-1$ evaluates to $0$ for every point in the feasible set. Thus, the added inequality is **tight on the feasible set**.\n\n-   **Slater's Condition for (P1):** To check Slater's condition for (P1), we must find a point $x$ that satisfies the equality constraint $h_1(x) = x_1+x_2-1 = 0$ while strictly satisfying all inequality constraints:\n    1.  $g_1(x) = -x_1  0 \\implies x_1  0$.\n    2.  $g_2(x) = -x_2  0 \\implies x_2  0$.\n    3.  $g_3(x) = x_1+x_2-1  0 \\implies x_1+x_2  1$.\nThe equality constraint requires $x_1 + x_2 = 1$. The third strict inequality requires $x_1 + x_2  1$. It is impossible for a point to simultaneously satisfy both $x_1 + x_2 = 1$ and $x_1 + x_2  1$. No such point exists. Therefore, **Slater's condition does not hold for (P1)**.\n\n**Part 3: Barrier Subproblem Analysis**\nThe logarithmic barrier method is used for problems with inequality constraints. For (P0), the inequalities are $x_1 \\ge 0$ and $x_2 \\ge 0$. The barrier function is $-\\mu(\\ln x_1 + \\ln x_2)$, where the domain requires $x_1 > 0$ and $x_2 > 0$. The barrier subproblem is:\n$$\n\\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}} \\; \\frac{1}{2}\\big(x_{1}^{2} + x_{2}^{2}\\big) - \\mu\\big(\\ln x_{1} + \\ln x_{2}\\big) \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad x_{1} + x_{2} = 1.\n$$\nTo solve this equality-constrained problem, we use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(x_1, x_2, \\nu) = \\frac{1}{2}\\big(x_{1}^{2} + x_{2}^{2}\\big) - \\mu\\big(\\ln x_{1} + \\ln x_{2}\\big) + \\nu(x_1 + x_2 - 1).\n$$\nThe first-order necessary conditions for optimality (stationarity) are obtained by setting the gradient with respect to $x$ to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x_1} = x_1 - \\frac{\\mu}{x_1} + \\nu = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x_2} = x_2 - \\frac{\\mu}{x_2} + \\nu = 0\n$$\nFrom these two equations, we have $x_1 + \\nu = \\mu/x_1$ and $x_2 + \\nu = \\mu/x_2$. Subtracting the second from the first gives $x_1 - x_2 = \\mu/x_1 - \\mu/x_2 = \\mu \\frac{x_2-x_1}{x_1x_2}$. Rearranging terms, we get:\n$$\n(x_1 - x_2) = -\\frac{\\mu}{x_1 x_2}(x_1-x_2) \\implies (x_1 - x_2)\\left(1 + \\frac{\\mu}{x_1 x_2}\\right) = 0.\n$$\nSince $\\mu > 0$ and the domain of the barrier function ensures $x_1 > 0$ and $x_2 > 0$, the term $(1 + \\frac{\\mu}{x_1 x_2})$ is strictly positive. Therefore, the only possibility is $x_1 - x_2 = 0$, which implies $x_1 = x_2$.\n\nUsing the feasibility constraint $x_1 + x_2 = 1$, we substitute $x_2=x_1$ to get $x_1 + x_1 = 1$, or $2x_1=1$. This yields $x_1 = 1/2$ and thus $x_2 = 1/2$.\nThe unique minimizer of the barrier subproblem is $x(\\mu) = (1/2, 1/2)$. This path of minimizers, known as the central path, is surprisingly constant for this specific problem.\n\nThe objective value along this path is found by substituting $x(\\mu)$ into the subproblem's objective function:\n$$\nf_{\\text{barrier}}(x(\\mu)) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\\right) - \\mu\\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}\\right) - \\mu\\left(2\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{4} - 2\\mu(-\\ln 2) = \\frac{1}{4} + 2\\mu\\ln 2.\n$$\nNow, consider the analogous barrier subproblem for (P1). The inequality constraints are $x_1 \\ge 0$, $x_2 \\ge 0$, and $x_1+x_2 \\le 1$. The barrier function would be $-\\mu(\\ln x_1 + \\ln x_2 + \\ln(1 - (x_1+x_2)))$. The subproblem is:\n$$\n\\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}} \\; \\frac{1}{2}\\big(x_{1}^{2} + x_{2}^{2}\\big) - \\mu\\big(\\ln x_{1} + \\ln x_{2} + \\ln(1 - (x_1+x_2))\\big) \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad x_{1} + x_{2} = 1.\n$$\nThe domain of the logarithmic barrier function requires its arguments to be strictly positive: $x_1 > 0$, $x_2 > 0$, and $1 - (x_1+x_2) > 0 \\implies x_1+x_2  1$. The feasible set of the subproblem is defined by the equality constraint $x_1+x_2=1$. The intersection of the domain of the objective function and the feasible set of the subproblem is the empty set. It is impossible to find a point that simultaneously satisfies $x_1+x_2  1$ and $x_1+x_2 = 1$.\nConsequently, the barrier subproblem for (P1) is ill-posed as it is infeasible. An interior-point method cannot be initialized because no strictly feasible starting point exists. The failure of Slater's condition for (P1) manifests as the immediate failure of the barrier method. This illustrates that formulations that violate Slater's condition, even with redundant constraints, are numerically and algorithmically problematic for interior-point methods.\n\n**Final Task: Optimal Objective Value of (P0)**\nTo find the optimal value of (P0), we can take the limit of the barrier subproblem's objective value as $\\mu \\to 0^+$:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\mu \\to 0^+} \\left(\\frac{1}{4} + 2\\mu\\ln 2\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nThis suggests the optimal value is $1/4$. We can verify this by solving (P0) directly using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. The point $x^* = (1/2, 1/2)$ is the candidate solution from the central path.\n1.  **Primal Feasibility:** $x_1^*+x_2^* = 1/2+1/2=1$. $x_1^* \\ge 0, x_2^* \\ge 0$. All satisfied.\n2.  **KKT Conditions:** The Lagrangian for (P0) is $\\mathcal{L}(x, \\lambda, \\nu) = \\frac{1}{2}(x_1^2+x_2^2) - \\lambda_1 x_1 - \\lambda_2 x_2 + \\nu(x_1+x_2-1)$. Stationarity requires $\\nabla_x \\mathcal{L} = 0$, so $x_1-\\lambda_1+\\nu=0$ and $x_2-\\lambda_2+\\nu=0$. Complementary slackness requires $\\lambda_1 x_1 = 0$ and $\\lambda_2 x_2 = 0$.\nAt $x^*=(1/2, 1/2)$, since $x_1^* > 0$ and $x_2^*>0$, we must have $\\lambda_1^*=0$ and $\\lambda_2^*=0$.\nSubstituting into stationarity: $1/2 - 0 + \\nu = 0 \\implies \\nu = -1/2$. Both equations yield the same $\\nu$.\nThe dual feasibility conditions $\\lambda_1 \\ge 0$ and $\\lambda_2 \\ge 0$ are met.\nSince a point $x^*$ and dual variables $(\\lambda^*, \\nu^*)$ exist that satisfy all KKT conditions, and the problem is convex, $x^*=(1/2, 1/2)$ is the unique optimal solution.\n\nThe optimal objective value is:\n$$\nf_0(x^*) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nGeometrically, this problem seeks the point on the line segment connecting $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ that is closest to the origin. By symmetry, this is the midpoint $(1/2, 1/2)$. The squared distance to the origin is $(1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 = 1/2$. The objective function is half the squared distance, so the minimum value is $(1/2) \\times (1/2) = 1/4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$$", "id": "3183188"}, {"introduction": "We can elevate our analysis beyond a simple \"yes or no\" verdict on strict feasibility.

All terms ($A_i, b_i, d_i, e_i, c, x$) and conditions (SOCP constraint, strict feasibility) are standard and formally defined. The problem is self-contained, scientifically grounded in mathematics, and objective. It is not underspecified, overconstrained, or based on any false premises. The task is to derive a specific value based on these rigorous definitions, which is a standard procedure in this field.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem is a Second-Order Cone Program (SOCP) with a single decision variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The objective is to minimize $f(x) = c^{\\top} x = [1]x = x$.\nThe problem is subject to two SOCP constraints. Let us write them out explicitly using the given data.\n\nFor the first constraint ($i=1$):\n$A_1 = [1]$, $b_1 = [0]$, $d_1 = [1]$, $e_1 = \\alpha$.\nThe term $A_1 x + b_1$ is $[1]x + [0] = [x]$. The $L_2$-norm is $\\|[x]\\|_2 = \\sqrt{x^2} = |x|$.\nThe term $d_1^{\\top} x + e_1$ is $[1]x + \\alpha = x + \\alpha$.\nSo, the first constraint is $|x| \\le x + \\alpha$. The associated nonnegativity condition is $x + \\alpha \\ge 0$. Note that if $|x| \\le x + \\alpha$ holds, then $x + \\alpha \\ge |x| \\ge 0$, so the nonnegativity condition is redundant.\n\nFor the second constraint ($i=2$):\n$A_2 = [1]$, $b_2 = [1]$, $d_2 = [-1]$, $e_2 = 0$.\nThe term $A_2 x + b_2$ is $[1]x + [1] = [x+1]$. The $L_2$-norm is $\\|[x+1]\\|_2 = \\sqrt{(x+1)^2} = |x+1|$.\nThe term $d_2^{\\top} x + e_2$ is $[-1]x + 0 = -x$.\nSo, the second constraint is $|x+1| \\le -x$. The associated nonnegativity condition is $-x \\ge 0$, or $x \\le 0$. Similar to the first constraint, if $|x+1| \\le -x$ holds, then $-x \\ge |x+1| \\ge 0$, so the nonnegativity is redundant.\n\nSlater's condition requires the existence of at least one point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ that is strictly feasible. This means $x$ must satisfy both inequality constraints strictly:\n1. $|x|  x + \\alpha$\n2. $|x+1|  -x$\n\nLet's analyze these two strict inequalities to find the set of $x$ that satisfies them.\n\nAnalysis of the second inequality: $|x+1|  -x$.\nFor this inequality to hold, the right-hand side must be positive, so $-x  0$, which implies $x  0$. We consider two cases for $|x+1|$ based on the sign of $x+1$.\nCase (a): $-1 \\le x  0$. In this interval, $x+1 \\ge 0$, so $|x+1| = x+1$. The inequality becomes:\n$x+1  -x$\n$2x  -1$\n$x  -\\frac{1}{2}$\nCombining with the case condition $-1 \\le x  0$, the solution for this case is $-1 \\le x  -1/2$.\n\nCase (b): $x  -1$. In this interval, $x+1  0$, so $|x+1| = -(x+1)$. The inequality becomes:\n$-(x+1)  -x$\n$-x-1  -x$\n$-1  0$\nThis inequality is always true. Thus, all $x$ in the interval $(-\\infty, -1)$ satisfy the condition.\n\nCombining the results from both cases, the set of all $x$ satisfying $|x+1|  -x$ is the union of $(-\\infty, -1)$ and $[-1, -1/2)$, which is the interval $(-\\infty, -1/2)$.\n\nAnalysis of the first inequality: $|x|  x + \\alpha$.\nFor Slater's condition to be met, there must be an $x$ that satisfies both strict inequalities. From the analysis of the second inequality, we know that such an $x$ must lie in the interval $(-\\infty, -1/2)$. For any $x$ in this interval, $x$ is negative.\nSince $x  0$, we have $|x| = -x$. Substituting this into the first inequality gives:\n$-x  x + \\alpha$\n$0  2x + \\alpha$\n$-2x  \\alpha$\n$x  -\\frac{\\alpha}{2}$\n\nSo, for a strictly feasible point $x$ to exist, there must be an $x$ that satisfies both $x  -1/2$ and $x  -\\alpha/2$. This means the intersection of the sets $(-\\infty, -1/2)$ and $(-\\alpha/2, \\infty)$ must be non-empty. The intersection is the open interval $(-\\alpha/2, -1/2)$.\n\nFor an open interval $(a, b)$ to be non-empty, we require $a  b$. In our case, this means:\n$-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}  -\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $-2$ reverses the inequality sign:\n$\\alpha  1$\n\nThis derivation shows that a strictly feasible point $x$ exists if and only if $\\alpha  1$. The problem asks for the threshold value $\\alpha^{\\star}$ such that for all $\\alpha  \\alpha^{\\star}$, a strictly feasible point exists. Based on our result, this threshold is $\\alpha^{\\star} = 1$.\n\nNow, for the second part of the problem, we explain the implications of Slater's condition being satisfied.\nThe problem described is an SOCP, which is a type of convex optimization problem. For convex optimization problems, Slater's condition (the existence of a strictly feasible point) is a sufficient condition for strong duality.\n\nWhen $\\alpha  \\alpha^{\\star} = 1$, we have shown that Slater's condition holds for this SOCP. The consequences are as follows:\n1.  **Strong Duality**: Strong duality holds for the optimization problem. This means that the optimal value of the primal problem, denoted $p^{\\star}$, is equal to the optimal value of its Lagrange dual problem, denoted $d^{\\star}$. That is, $p^{\\star} = d^{\\star}$.\n2.  **Zero Duality Gap**: The duality gap, defined as the difference $p^{\\star} - d^{\\star}$, is zero. In general, for any optimization problem, weak duality holds, which means $p^{\\star} \\ge d^{\\star}$. Strong duality is the special case where this gap closes.\n3.  **Attainment of Dual Optimum**: For SOCPs (and more generally for convex problems with polyhedral constraints, although SOCP constraints are not polyhedral), Slater's condition implies not only that the duality gap is zero but also that there exists at least one dual optimal solution $\\lambda^{\\star}$ for the dual problem.\n\nIn summary, for $\\alpha  1$, the satisfaction of Slater's condition guarantees that we can solve the primal problem by solving its dual, and there will be no difference between their optimal objective values.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3183141"}]}
