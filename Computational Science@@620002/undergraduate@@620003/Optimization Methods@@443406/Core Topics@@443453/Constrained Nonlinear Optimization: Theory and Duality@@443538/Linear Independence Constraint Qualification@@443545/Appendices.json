The analysis involves finding the feasible points, determining the condition for LICQ failure, and then counting the number of feasible points at which LICQ fails.\n\nThe two equality constraints are given by:\n$h_{1}(x,y) = x^{2} + y^{2} - 1 = 0$\n$h_{2}(x,y) = (x-1)^{2} + y^{2} - 1 = 0$\n\nThe feasible set consists of all points $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ that simultaneously satisfy both constraints. At any feasible point, both constraints are active by definition.\n\n**Step 1: Jacobian and LICQ Criterion**\nThe LICQ requires that the gradients of all active constraints at a feasible point are linearly independent. We first compute the gradients of the constraint functions $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$ with respect to the variables $x$ and $y$.\n\nThe gradient of $h_{1}$ is:\n$$ \\nabla h_{1}(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial h_{1}}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial h_{1}}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x \\\\ 2y \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe gradient of $h_{2}$ is:\n$$ \\nabla h_{2}(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial h_{2}}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial h_{2}}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2(x-1) \\\\ 2y \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe Jacobian of the constraints, denoted $J(x,y)$, is the matrix whose rows are the transposes of these gradient vectors:\n$$ J(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} (\\nabla h_{1}(x,y))^{T} \\\\ (\\nabla h_{2}(x,y))^{T} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x & 2y \\\\ 2(x-1) & 2y \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe LICQ holds at a point $(x,y)$ if the rows of $J(x,y)$ are linearly independent. For a square matrix, this is equivalent to the condition that its determinant is non-zero. Therefore, LICQ holds if $\\det(J(x,y)) \\neq 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Solving for Feasible Points**\nTo find the feasible points, we must solve the system of two non-linear equations:\n$1. \\quad x^{2} + y^{2} = 1$\n$2. \\quad (x-1)^{2} + y^{2} = 1$\n\nFrom equation ($1$), we can express $y^{2}$ as $y^{2} = 1 - x^{2}$. Substituting this into equation ($2$):\n$$ (x-1)^{2} + (1 - x^{2}) = 1 $$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$ (x^{2} - 2x + 1) + 1 - x^{2} = 1 $$\nThe $x^{2}$ terms cancel out:\n$$ -2x + 2 = 1 $$\nSolving for $x$:\n$$ -2x = 1 - 2 = -1 \\implies x = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nNow, we substitute this value of $x$ back into the expression for $y^{2}$:\n$$ y^{2} = 1 - x^{2} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4} $$\nThis gives two possible values for $y$:\n$$ y = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} $$\nThus, there are two feasible points, which are the intersection points of the two circles defined by the constraints:\n$P_{1} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$ and $P_{2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$.\n\n**Step 3: Locus of LICQ Failure and Geometric Meaning**\nLICQ fails when the constraint gradients are linearly dependent. This occurs when the determinant of the Jacobian is zero.\n$$ \\det(J(x,y)) = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 2x & 2y \\\\ 2(x-1) & 2y \\end{pmatrix} = (2x)(2y) - (2y)(2(x-1)) $$\n$$ \\det(J(x,y)) = 4xy - 4y(x-1) = 4xy - 4xy + 4y = 4y $$\nSo, the gradients are linearly dependent if and only if $4y = 0$, which simplifies to $y=0$. The locus of points in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ where LICQ fails is the x-axis.\n\nThe geometric meaning of this locus is as follows:\n- The constraint $h_{1}=0$ defines a circle centered at $(0,0)$ with radius $1$. The gradient $\\nabla h_{1}(x,y)$ is a vector normal to this circle at the point $(x,y)$ and points radially from the center $(0,0)$.\n- The constraint $h_{2}=0$ defines a circle centered at $(1,0)$ with radius $1$. The gradient $\\nabla h_{2}(x,y)$ is a vector normal to this circle at $(x,y)$ and points radially from its center $(1,0)$.\n- The two gradient vectors are linearly dependent (collinear) if and only if the point $(x,y)$ lies on the line connecting the centers of the two circles. The centers are $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$, so the line connecting them is the x-axis, defined by the equation $y=0$. This confirms that the locus of linear dependence is the x-axis. Points of tangency between the two constraint surfaces, if they existed, would belong to this locus.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion on LICQ Failure at Feasible Points**\nWe must determine how many feasible points lie on the locus where LICQ fails.\n- The feasible points are $P_{1} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$ and $P_{2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$.\n- The locus where LICQ fails is the set of all points $(x,y)$ such that $y=0$.\n\nNow we check if the feasible points satisfy the condition for LICQ failure:\n- For $P_{1}$, the y-coordinate is $y = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\neq 0$. Therefore, LICQ holds at $P_{1}$.\n- For $P_{2}$, the y-coordinate is $y = -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\neq 0$. Therefore, LICQ holds at $P_{2}$.\n\nSince neither of the feasible points have a y-coordinate of $0$, neither lies on the locus where the constraint gradients are linearly dependent. Consequently, LICQ holds at all feasible points for this problem.\n\nThe number of feasible points at which LICQ fails is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3143958"}, {"introduction": "The way we formulate constraints can significantly impact the properties of an optimization problem.

We begin by validating the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Variables: $x$, $y$.\n- Equality constraint: $h(x,y) = x^{2} + y^{2} - 1 = 0$.\n- Inequality constraints: $g_{1}(x,y) = y \\leq 0$ and $g_{2}(x,y) = -y \\leq 0$.\n- Feasible points $(x,y)$ must satisfy $h(x,y)=0$, $g_{1}(x,y)\\leq 0$, and $g_{2}(x,y)\\leq 0$.\n- Points of interest for analysis are those with $y=0$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is well-defined and self-contained within the field of mathematical optimization. The constraints are clearly stated mathematical functions. The concept of LICQ is a standard topic in this field. The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or invalid premises. The problem is valid.\n\n### Solution\nThe feasible set is defined by the three constraints:\n$1$. $x^{2} + y^{2} = 1$\n$2$. $y \\leq 0$\n$3$. $-y \\leq 0$, which is equivalent to $y \\geq 0$.\n\nFor a point $(x,y)$ to be feasible, it must satisfy both $y \\leq 0$ and $y \\geq 0$. This implies that $y$ must be equal to $0$. Substituting $y=0$ into the equality constraint $x^{2} + y^{2} = 1$ gives $x^{2} + 0^{2} = 1$, which simplifies to $x^{2}=1$. The solutions are $x=1$ and $x=-1$.\nTherefore, the feasible set consists of only two points: $(1, 0)$ and $(-1, 0)$. The problem directs us to analyze the points where $y=0$, which are precisely these two feasible points.\n\nNext, we must identify the set of active constraints at these points. A constraint is active at a point if it is satisfied with equality.\n- The equality constraint $h(x,y) = x^{2} + y^{2} - 1 = 0$ is, by definition, active at all feasible points.\n- The inequality constraint $g_{1}(x,y) = y \\leq 0$ is active if $y = 0$. At the points $(1,0)$ and $(-1,0)$, we have $y=0$, so $g_1$ is active.\n- The inequality constraint $g_{2}(x,y) = -y \\leq 0$ is active if $-y = 0$, which also means $y=0$. At the points $(1,0)$ and $(-1,0)$, we have $y=0$, so $g_2$ is also active.\n\nThus, at both points $(1,0)$ and $(-1,0)$, all three constraints $h$, $g_1$, and $g_2$ are active.\n\nThe Linear Independence Constraint Qualification (LICQ) holds at a feasible point if the gradients of the active constraints at that point are linearly independent. We first compute the gradients of the constraint functions:\n- $\\nabla h(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x & 2y \\end{pmatrix}$\n- $\\nabla g_{1}(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial g_{1}}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial g_{1}}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- $\\nabla g_{2}(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial g_{2}}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial g_{2}}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow we evaluate these gradients at each point of interest.\n\nCase 1: The point $(1, 0)$.\nThe active constraint gradients are:\n- $\\nabla h(1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2(1) & 2(0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- $\\nabla g_{1}(1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- $\\nabla g_{2}(1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe form a matrix $A$ whose rows are these gradient vectors:\n$$ A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nLICQ requires these vectors to be linearly independent. This is equivalent to the matrix $A$ having a rank equal to the number of active constraints, which is $3$. The rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its rows (or columns). The row vectors are $v_1 = (2,0)$, $v_2 = (0,1)$, and $v_3 = (0,-1)$. We observe that $v_3 = -v_2$, or $v_2 + v_3 = (0,0)$. This means the set of vectors is linearly dependent. For instance, the non-trivial linear combination $0 \\cdot v_1 + 1 \\cdot v_2 + 1 \\cdot v_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSince the vectors are linearly dependent, LICQ does not hold at $(1,0)$. The rank of the matrix $A$ is the number of linearly independent rows. The vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ are linearly independent and span the same space as all three vectors. Thus, the rank of $A$ is $2$.\n\nCase 2: The point $(-1, 0)$.\nThe active constraint gradients are:\n- $\\nabla h(-1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2(-1) & 2(0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- $\\nabla g_{1}(-1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- $\\nabla g_{2}(-1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe matrix $A'$ of active constraint gradients is:\n$$ A' = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSimilar to the first case, the row vectors are linearly dependent because $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Therefore, LICQ also does not hold at $(-1,0)$. The rank of the matrix $A'$ is the maximum number of linearly independent rows, which is again $2$, as $\\begin{pmatrix} -2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ form a basis for the row space.\n\nIn both cases, the number of active constraints is $3$ but the rank of the matrix of their gradients is $2$. Since the rank is less than the number of active constraints, the LICQ condition fails at all feasible points. The problem asks for the rank of the active-constraint gradient matrix. In both instances, this rank is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3144024"}, {"introduction": "Not all LICQ failures are as obvious as those caused by redundant constraints.

At a feasible point $\\mathbf{x}$, let $\\mathcal{E}$ be the set of indices for equality constraints $h_i(\\mathbf{x})=0$, and let $\\mathcal{A}(\\mathbf{x})$ be the set of indices for active inequality constraints, i.e., $j \\in \\mathcal{A}(\\mathbf{x})$ if $g_j(\\mathbf{x})=0$.

The equality constraint is satisfied.\n$g(0,0) = 0 \\le 0$. The inequality constraint is satisfied.\nThus, $(0,0)$ is a feasible point.\n\nNext, we identify the active constraints at $(0,0)$. Equality constraints are always considered active. The inequality constraint $g(x,y) \\le 0$ is active because $g(0,0) = 0$. Therefore, both $h(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are active at $(0,0)$.\n\nWe now compute the gradients of these active constraints. The gradient of a scalar function $f(x,y)$ is $\\nabla f = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFor $h(x,y) = y - x^2$, the gradient is $\\nabla h(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2x \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFor $g(x,y) = x$, the gradient is $\\nabla g(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nEvaluating these gradients at the point $(0,0)$:\n$\\nabla h(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2(0) \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$\\nabla g(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nTo check if LICQ holds, we must determine if the set of vectors $\\{\\nabla h(0,0), \\nabla g(0,0)\\} = \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\}$ is linearly independent. We test this by seeking coefficients $c_1, c_2$ such that the linear combination is the zero vector:\n$c_1 \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + c_2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\nThis vector equation expands into a system of linear equations:\n$c_2 = 0$\n$c_1 = 0$\nThe only solution is the trivial one, $c_1 = 0$ and $c_2 = 0$. Therefore, the gradient vectors are linearly independent, and LICQ holds at the point $(0,0)$ for the first system.\n\nNow, we analyze the modified system to find the parameter value $t^{\\star}$ where LICQ fails.\nSystem 2:\nEquality constraint: $\\tilde{h}(x,y) = y - x^3 = 0$.\nInequality constraint: $\\tilde{g}(x,y) = y \\le 0$.\n\nThe problem defines a parametrization of the feasible set. Points on the equality-constraint manifold satisfy $y = x^3$. Using the parameter $t$, we can represent any such point as $(x(t), y(t)) = (t, t^3)$.\nFor a point to be feasible, it must also satisfy the inequality constraint $\\tilde{g}(x,y) \\le 0$, which is $y \\le 0$. Substituting the parametrization, we get $t^3 \\le 0$, which implies $t \\le 0$.\nThe set of feasible points is therefore $\\{(t, t^3) \\mid t \\le 0\\}$.\n\nWe will now check for LICQ failure at points along this feasible curve.\nFirst, we find the active constraints at a feasible point $(t, t^3)$ for $t \\le 0$.\nThe equality constraint $\\tilde{h}(x,y)=0$ is active at all feasible points by definition.\nThe inequality constraint $\\tilde{g}(x,y) \\le 0$ is active when $\\tilde{g}(x,y) = 0$, which means $y=0$. For a point $(t, t^3)$ on the curve, this condition becomes $t^3=0$, which implies $t=0$.\n\nThis gives two cases to analyze for $t \\le 0$:\nCase 1: $t < 0$.

The only active constraint gradient is $\\nabla \\tilde{h}(t, t^3) = \\begin{pmatrix} -3t^2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFor LICQ to hold, the set containing this single vector must be linearly independent. A set with one vector is linearly independent if and only if the vector is not the zero vector. Here, since $t<0$, $t^2 > 0$, so the gradient $\\begin{pmatrix} -3t^2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ is never the zero vector. Thus, LICQ holds for all $t < 0$.\n\nCase 2: $t = 0$.\nThe point is $(0,0)$. Both constraints are active. We must check the linear independence of the set of gradients $\\{\\nabla \\tilde{h}(0,0), \\nabla \\tilde{g}(0,0)\\}$.\n$\\nabla \\tilde{h}(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} -3(0)^2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$\\nabla \\tilde{g}(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe set of active gradients is $\\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\}$.\nSince the two vectors in the set are identical (and non-zero), the set is linearly dependent. For instance, a non-trivial linear combination that yields the zero vector is $1 \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} - 1 \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nTherefore, LICQ fails at the point $(0,0)$, which corresponds to the parameter value $t=0$.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only point in the feasible set where LICQ fails is $(0,0)$, corresponding to the parameter value $t=0$.
