We will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe primal problem is to minimize the function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|x - c\\|_{2}^{2}$ for $x$ in a feasible set, where $c = (2, 0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\n**1. Fenchel Dual Formulation for the Open Unit Ball**\n\nThe feasible set is the open unit ball $S_{\\mathrm{open}} = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : \\|x\\|_{2} < 1\\}$. The optimization problem can be formulated as an unconstrained problem by using the indicator function of the set $S_{\\mathrm{open}}$, which is defined as $\\mathbb{I}_{S_{\\mathrm{open}}}(x) = 0$ if $x \\in S_{\\mathrm{open}}$ and $\\mathbb{I}_{S_{\\mathrm{open}}}(x) = +\\infty$ otherwise.\n\nThe primal problem is:\n$$ \\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\|x - c\\|_{2}^{2} + \\mathbb{I}_{S_{\\mathrm{open}}}(x) \\right) $$\nThis is of the form $\\min_x (F(x) + G(x))$, where $F(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|x - c\\|_{2}^{2}$ and $G(x) = \\mathbb{I}_{S_{\\mathrm{open}}}(x)$. The Fenchel dual problem is given by $\\max_y (-F^*(y) - G^*(-y))$, where $F^*$ and $G^*$ are the Fenchel conjugates of $F$ and $G$, respectively.\n\nFirst, we compute the Fenchel conjugate of $F(x)$:\n$$ F^*(y) = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2} (\\langle y, x \\rangle - F(x)) = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2} \\left( y^T x - \\frac{1}{2}(x - c)^T(x - c) \\right) $$\nThe term inside the supremum is a strictly concave quadratic function of $x$. Its maximum is found by setting the gradient with respect to $x$ to zero:\n$$ \\nabla_x \\left( y^T x - \\frac{1}{2}(x^T x - 2c^T x + c^T c) \\right) = y - (x - c) = 0 $$\nThis gives the maximizing $x = y + c$. Substituting this back into the expression:\n$$ F^*(y) = y^T(y+c) - \\frac{1}{2}((y+c)-c)^T((y+c)-c) = y^T y + y^T c - \\frac{1}{2}y^T y = \\frac{1}{2}\\|y\\|_{2}^{2} + y^T c $$\nNext, we compute the Fenchel conjugate of $G(x) = \\mathbb{I}_{S_{\\mathrm{open}}}(x)$. The conjugate of an indicator function of a set is the support function of that set, $\\sigma_{S_{\\mathrm{open}}}(y)$.\n$$ G^*(y) = \\sigma_{S_{\\mathrm{open}}}(y) = \\sup_{x \\in S_{\\mathrm{open}}} \\langle y, x \\rangle = \\sup_{\\|x\\|_2 < 1} y^T x $$\nBy the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, $y^T x \\le \\|y\\|_2 \\|x\\|_2$. Since $\\|x\\|_2 < 1$, we have $y^T x < \\|y\\|_2$. The supremum is $\\|y\\|_2$, which is approached by taking $x$ in the direction of $y$ with a norm approaching $1$. The support function of a convex set is equal to the support function of its closure. Thus, $\\sigma_{S_{\\mathrm{open}}}(y) = \\sigma_{\\overline{S_{\\mathrm{open}}}}(y) = \\max_{\\|x\\|_2 \\le 1} y^T x = \\|y\\|_2$.\nSo, $G^*(y) = \\|y\\|_2$.\n\nThe dual problem is to maximize the dual objective function $D(y)$:\n$$ D(y) = -F^*(y) - G^*(-y) = -\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\|y\\|_{2}^{2} + y^T c\\right) - \\|-y\\|_2 = -\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\|y\\|_{2}^{2} + y^T c + \\|y\\|_2\\right) $$\nMaximizing $D(y)$ is equivalent to minimizing its negative, let's call it $D_{obj}(y)$:\n$$ \\min_{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^2} D_{obj}(y) = \\min_{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\|y\\|_{2}^{2} + y^T c + \\|y\\|_2\\right) $$\nThis objective function is convex and is differentiable for $y \\ne 0$. We find the optimizer by setting its gradient to zero. With $c=(2,0)^T$:\n$$ \\nabla D_{obj}(y) = y + c + \\frac{y}{\\|y\\|_2} = y\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\|y\\|_2}\\right) + c = 0 $$\nThis implies $y$ must be collinear with and oppositely directed to $c$, so $y = -kc$ for some scalar $k>0$.\n$$ -kc\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\|-kc\\|_2}\\right) + c = 0 \\implies c\\left(1 - k\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{k\\|c\\|_2}\\right)\\right) = 0 $$\nSince $c \\ne 0$, we have $1 - k(1 + \\frac{1}{k\\|c\\|_2}) = 0 \\implies 1 = k + \\frac{1}{\\|c\\|_2}$.\nGiven $c=(2,0)$, we have $\\|c\\|_2 = 2$. Therefore, $k = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\|c\\|_2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe dual optimizer is $y^* = -kc = -\\frac{1}{2}(2, 0) = (-1, 0)$.\n\n**2. Primal Infimum and Existence of a Minimizer**\n\nThe primal problem is to find the point in the open unit ball $S_{\\mathrm{open}}$ that is closest to $c=(2,0)$. Geometrically, the point in the closed unit ball $\\overline{S_{\\mathrm{open}}} = \\{x: \\|x\\|_2 \\le 1\\}$ closest to $c$ is the projection of $c$ onto the ball, which is $x_{proj} = \\frac{c}{\\|c\\|_2} = \\frac{(2,0)}{2} = (1,0)$. The minimum squared distance would be $\\|(1,0) - (2,0)\\|_2^2 = 1$, and the minimum objective value would be $\\frac{1}{2}(1) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFor the problem over the open ball $S_{\\mathrm{open}}$, any feasible point $x$ must satisfy $\\|x\\|_2 < 1$. The point $(1,0)$ is not in $S_{\\mathrm{open}}$. We can, however, construct a sequence of points within $S_{\\mathrm{open}}$ that converges to $(1,0)$, for example $x_n = (1 - \\frac{1}{n}, 0)$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}, n>1$. For this sequence, the objective value is:\n$$ f(x_n) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|(1-\\frac{1}{n}, 0) - (2,0)\\|_2^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\|(-1-\\frac{1}{n}, 0)\\|_2^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^2 $$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, $x_n \\to (1,0)$ and $f(x_n) \\to \\frac{1}{2}$. The infimum of the objective function over $S_{\\mathrm{open}}$ is thus $p^* = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nHowever, no minimizer exists in $S_{\\mathrm{open}}$. If a minimizer $x^*$ existed, it would have to satisfy $f(x^*) = \\frac{1}{2}$, which means $\\frac{1}{2}\\|x^*-c\\|_2^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$, or $\\|x^*-c\\|_2 = 1$. The only point satisfying this and $\\|x^*\\|_2 \\le 1$ is $x^*=(1,0)$. Since $(1,0) \\notin S_{\\mathrm{open}}$, the infimum is not attained in the feasible set. This is a consequence of minimizing a continuous function over a non-closed set.\n\n**3. Pointwise Duality Gap Calculation**\n\nWe are given the point $x_{\\varepsilon} = (1 - \\varepsilon, 0)$ with $\\varepsilon = 0.2$, so $x_{0.2} = (0.8, 0)$. This point is feasible since $\\|x_{0.2}\\|_2 = 0.8 < 1$.\n\nThe primal objective value at this point is:\n$$ f(x_{0.2}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|(0.8, 0) - (2, 0)\\|_2^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\|(-1.2, 0)\\|_2^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(-1.2)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(1.44) = 0.72 $$\nThe dual objective value at the dual optimizer $y^* = (-1, 0)$ is the dual optimal value $d^*$.\n$$ d^* = D(y^*) = -\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\|y^*\\|_{2}^{2} + (y^*)^T c + \\|y^*\\|_2\\right) = -\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\|(-1,0)\\|_2^2 + \\langle (-1,0), (2,0) \\rangle + \\|(-1,0)\\|_2\\right) $$\n$$ d^* = -\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(1)^2 + (-2) + 1\\right) = -\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - 1\\right) = -(-\\frac{1}{2}) = 0.5 $$\nThe pointwise duality gap is the difference between the primal objective at the specific point $x_{0.2}$ and the optimal dual objective value $d^*$:\n$$ \\text{Gap} = f(x_{0.2}) - d^* = 0.72 - 0.5 = 0.22 $$\nTo four significant figures, this is $0.2200$.\n\n**4. Analysis for the Closed Unit Ball**\n\nWhen the feasible set is changed to the closed unit ball $S_{\\mathrm{closed}} = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : \\|x\\|_{2} \\leq 1\\}$, the problem becomes:\n$$ \\min_{x \\in S_{\\mathrm{closed}}} \\frac{1}{2}\\|x - c\\|_{2}^{2} $$\nThe set $S_{\\mathrm{closed}}$ is closed and bounded in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, hence it is compact. The objective function $f(x)$ is continuous. By the Weierstrass Extreme Value Theorem, a continuous function on a compact set must attain its minimum. Therefore, a primal minimizer $x^*$ exists. As established previously, this minimizer is the projection $x^*=(1,0)$, and the primal optimal value is $p^* = f(x^*) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe dual problem does not change because the support function of a convex set is the same as that of its closure, i.e., $\\sigma_{S_{\\mathrm{closed}}}(y) = \\sigma_{S_{\\mathrm{open}}}(y) = \\|y\\|_2$. Thus, the dual optimal value is still $d^* = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nIn this case, the primal and dual optimal values are equal, $p^* = d^* = \\frac{1}{2}$, so strong duality holds. The duality gap, defined as $p^* - d^*$, is $0$. Strong duality is guaranteed for this convex problem by Slater's constraint qualification. The constraint is $g(x) = \\|x\\|_2^2 - 1 \\le 0$. There exists a point $x=0$ which is strictly feasible, i.e., $g(0) = -1 < 0$. This ensures that strong duality holds. The zero duality gap is a direct consequence. At the primal-dual optimal pair, the gap is zero, unlike the pointwise gap calculated for a non-optimal primal point in Part 3. The crucial difference is the closed nature of the feasible set, which guarantees the existence of a primal minimizer where the infimum is attained.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2200}$$", "id": "3123554"}, {"introduction": "After exploring a scenario with a non-zero gap, we now investigate conditions that guarantee strong duality.

The convention $0 \\ln 0 := 0$ is used.\n\n**Part 1: Strict Feasibility (Slater's Condition)**\n\nStrict feasibility, by its definition, requires the existence of a feasible point $\\tilde{x}$ that satisfies all inequality constraints strictly. For this problem, the inequality constraints are $g_i(x) = -x_i \\le 0$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. A strictly feasible point $\\tilde{x}$ must therefore satisfy:\n$1$. $\\tilde{x}$ is feasible, meaning it satisfies all equality and inequality constraints.\n$2$. $g_i(\\tilde{x}) < 0$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nThe second condition implies $-\\tilde{x}_i < 0$, which is equivalent to $\\tilde{x}_i > 0$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\nHowever, the feasibility condition (the first condition) requires $\\tilde{x}$ to satisfy the equality constraints, which include $h_2(\\tilde{x}) = \\tilde{x}_3 = 0$ and $h_3(\\tilde{x}) = \\tilde{x}_4 = 0$.\n\nWe have a contradiction. Strict feasibility requires $\\tilde{x}_3 > 0$ and $\\tilde{x}_4 > 0$, while feasibility requires $\\tilde{x}_3 = 0$ and $\\tilde{x}_4 = 0$. No point can satisfy both conditions simultaneously. Therefore, no strictly feasible point exists for this problem, and strict feasibility (in this sense) does not hold.\n\nIt is worth noting that a weaker condition, often called the refined Slater's condition, is sufficient for strong duality in convex problems. This condition requires only that the non-affine inequality constraints be strictly satisfied for some feasible point. Since all inequality constraints in this problem are affine, this condition reduces to requiring a non-empty feasible set. The point $x = (1/2, 1/2, 0, 0)^{\\top}$ is feasible, so the refined Slater's condition holds, and we expect a duality gap of zero.\n\n**Part 2: Lagrangian and Dual Function**\n\nTo form the Lagrangian, we can incorporate the non-negativity constraints $x_i \\ge 0$ into the domain of the minimization, rather than treating them as explicit constraints with corresponding Lagrange multipliers. We introduce Lagrange multipliers $\\nu_1, \\nu_3, \\nu_4 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ for the three equality constraints. The Lagrangian $L(x, \\nu)$ is:\n$$\nL(x, \\nu) = f(x) + \\nu_1 h_1(x) + \\nu_3 h_2(x) + \\nu_4 h_3(x)\n$$\n$$\nL(x, \\nu) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} x_i \\ln x_i + \\nu_1 \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{4} x_i - 1\\right) + \\nu_3 x_3 + \\nu_4 x_4\n$$\nThe dual function $g(\\nu)$ is the infimum of the Lagrangian over its domain, $x \\in \\text{dom}(f)$, which is $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^4 \\mid x_i \\ge 0\\}$.\n$$\ng(\\nu) = \\inf_{x \\ge 0} L(x, \\nu)\n$$\nWe can regroup terms in the Lagrangian by $x_i$:\n$$\nL(x, \\nu) = (x_1 \\ln x_1 + \\nu_1 x_1) + (x_2 \\ln x_2 + \\nu_1 x_2) + (x_3 \\ln x_3 + (\\nu_1+\\nu_3)x_3) + (x_4 \\ln x_4 + (\\nu_1+\\nu_4)x_4) - \\nu_1\n$$\nThe minimization problem decouples into four independent problems over $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$. We need to compute $\\inf_{t \\ge 0} (t \\ln t + c t)$ for a constant $c$. Let $\\phi(t) = t \\ln t + c t$. The derivative is $\\phi'(t) = \\ln t + 1 + c$. Setting $\\phi'(t) = 0$ gives $t_{min} = \\exp(-1-c)$. Since $\\phi''(t) = 1/t > 0$ for $t > 0$, this is a minimum.\nThe minimum value is $\\phi(t_{min}) = \\exp(-1-c) \\ln(\\exp(-1-c)) + c \\exp(-1-c) = \\exp(-1-c)(-1-c) + c \\exp(-1-c) = -\\exp(-1-c)$.\n\nApplying this result to each term in the Lagrangian:\n- For $x_1$: $c_1 = \\nu_1$, infimum is $-\\exp(-1-\\nu_1)$.\n- For $x_2$: $c_2 = \\nu_1$, infimum is $-\\exp(-1-\\nu_1)$.\n- For $x_3$: $c_3 = \\nu_1 + \\nu_3$, infimum is $-\\exp(-1-\\nu_1-\\nu_3)$.\n- For $x_4$: $c_4 = \\nu_1 + \\nu_4$, infimum is $-\\exp(-1-\\nu_1-\\nu_4)$.\n\nThe dual function is the sum of these infima minus $\\nu_1$:\n$$\ng(\\nu_1, \\nu_3, \\nu_4) = -2\\exp(-1-\\nu_1) - \\exp(-1-\\nu_1-\\nu_3) - \\exp(-1-\\nu_1-\\nu_4) - \\nu_1\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Maximize the Dual Function**\n\nThe dual problem is to maximize $g(\\nu)$ over $\\nu_1, \\nu_3, \\nu_4$. We take partial derivatives with respect to the dual variables:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\nu_3} = \\exp(-1-\\nu_1-\\nu_3)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\nu_4} = \\exp(-1-\\nu_1-\\nu_4)\n$$\nSince these partial derivatives are always positive, $g(\\nu)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $\\nu_3$ and $\\nu_4$. To maximize $g$, we must let $\\nu_3 \\to \\infty$ and $\\nu_4 \\to \\infty$. In this limit, the exponential terms involving $\\nu_3$ and $\\nu_4$ approach $0$.\nThe dual function to be maximized with respect to $\\nu_1$ becomes:\n$$\ng_{lim}(\\nu_1) = \\lim_{\\nu_3, \\nu_4 \\to \\infty} g(\\nu_1, \\nu_3, \\nu_4) = -2\\exp(-1-\\nu_1) - \\nu_1\n$$\nTo find the maximum, we set the derivative with respect to $\\nu_1$ to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d g_{lim}}{d \\nu_1} = -2\\exp(-1-\\nu_1)(-1) - 1 = 2\\exp(-1-\\nu_1) - 1 = 0\n$$\nThis yields $\\exp(-1-\\nu_1) = 1/2$. Taking the natural logarithm gives $-1-\\nu_1 = \\ln(1/2) = -\\ln 2$, so the optimal $\\nu_1^{\\star} = \\ln 2 - 1$.\nThe dual optimal value, $d^{\\star}$, is found by substituting $\\nu_1^{\\star}$ back into $g_{lim}(\\nu_1)$:\n$$\nd^{\\star} = -2\\exp(-1-(\\ln 2 - 1)) - (\\ln 2 - 1) = -2\\exp(-\\ln 2) - \\ln 2 + 1 = -2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\ln 2 + 1 = -1 - \\ln 2 + 1 = -\\ln 2\n$$\n\n**Part 4: Primal Optimal Value**\n\nWe can solve the primal problem directly by substituting the equality constraints into the objective function. The constraints $x_3 = 0$ and $x_4 = 0$, along with $\\sum x_i = 1$, simplify the problem to:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{minimize} \\quad & x_1 \\ln x_1 + x_2 \\ln x_2 \\\\\n\\text{subject to} \\quad & x_1 + x_2 = 1 \\\\\n& x_1 \\ge 0, x_2 \\ge 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n(The terms for $x_3, x_4$ are $0 \\ln 0 = 0$).\nSubstitute $x_2 = 1 - x_1$ to get a function of a single variable, $\\phi(x_1)$, for $x_1 \\in [0, 1]$:\n$$\n\\phi(x_1) = x_1 \\ln x_1 + (1-x_1) \\ln(1-x_1)\n$$\nTo find the minimum, we differentiate with respect to $x_1$ and set the derivative to zero:\n$$\n\\phi'(x_1) = (\\ln x_1 + 1) + (-\\ln(1-x_1) - 1) = \\ln x_1 - \\ln(1-x_1) = 0\n$$\nThis gives $\\ln x_1 = \\ln(1-x_1)$, which implies $x_1 = 1-x_1$, so $2x_1 = 1$ and $x_1^{\\star} = 1/2$.\nThen $x_2^{\\star} = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2$. The second derivative $\\phi''(x_1) = 1/x_1 + 1/(1-x_1)$ is positive on $(0, 1)$, confirming this is a minimum.\nThe primal optimal point is $x^{\\star} = (1/2, 1/2, 0, 0)^{\\top}$.\nThe primal optimal value, $p^{\\star}$, is the objective evaluated at this point:\n$$\np^{\\star} = f(x^{\\star}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 0 + 0 = 2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\ln 2\n$$\n\n**Part 5: Duality Gap**\n\nThe duality gap is defined as the difference between the primal optimal value and the dual optimal value, $p^{\\star} - d^{\\star}$.\nUsing our computed values:\n$$\np^{\\star} - d^{\\star} = (-\\ln 2) - (-\\ln 2) = 0\n$$\nThe duality gap is $0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3123598"}, {"introduction": "We now elevate our analysis from vector spaces to the more abstract and powerful domain of Semidefinite Programming (SDP), where we optimize over a cone of positive semidefinite matrices.

The constraints are\n$$\\langle E_{11}, X \\rangle = X_{11} = 0, \\qquad \\langle E_{22}, X \\rangle = X_{22} = 1,$$\nand the conic constraint is $X \\succeq 0$. Let $X = \\begin{pmatrix} X_{11} & X_{12} \\\\ X_{12} & X_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$. The equalities impose $X_{11} = 0$ and $X_{22} = 1$, so any feasible $X$ has the form\n$$X = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & X_{12} \\\\ X_{12} & 1 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nFor $X \\succeq 0$, every principal minor must be nonnegative. In particular, the leading principal minors give:\n- $X_{11} = 0 \\ge 0$ (satisfied),\n- The determinant must satisfy\n$$\\det(X) = X_{11} X_{22} - X_{12}^{2} = 0 \\cdot 1 - X_{12}^{2} = - X_{12}^{2} \\ge 0,$$\nwhich forces $X_{12} = 0$. Therefore, the only feasible matrix is\n$$X = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nThis matrix has rank $1$ and is not strictly positive definite. Hence, there is no strictly feasible point $X \\succ 0$ that satisfies the constraints, and Slater’s condition fails.\n\nNext, we derive the dual problem from the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian for the equality-constrained cone program (incorporating the equality constraints via Lagrange multipliers and handling the cone constraint through the dual function) is\n$$L(X, y) = \\langle C, X \\rangle + \\langle y, b - \\mathcal{A}(X) \\rangle = \\langle C, X \\rangle - \\langle \\mathcal{A}^{*}(y), X \\rangle + \\langle y, b \\rangle,$$\nwhere the adjoint operator $\\mathcal{A}^{*}$ is defined by\n$$\\langle \\mathcal{A}(X), y \\rangle = \\langle X, \\mathcal{A}^{*}(y) \\rangle \\quad \\text{for all } X \\in \\mathbb{S}^{2}, \\ y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}.$$\nFor our specific $\\mathcal{A}$, we have\n$$\\langle \\mathcal{A}(X), y \\rangle = y_{1} \\langle E_{11}, X \\rangle + y_{2} \\langle E_{22}, X \\rangle = \\langle y_{1} E_{11} + y_{2} E_{22}, X \\rangle,$$\nso\n$$\\mathcal{A}^{*}(y) = y_{1} E_{11} + y_{2} E_{22}.$$\nThus the Lagrangian becomes\n$$L(X, y) = \\langle C - \\mathcal{A}^{*}(y), X \\rangle + \\langle y, b \\rangle.$$\nThe dual function is\n$$g(y) = \\inf_{X \\succeq 0} L(X, y) = \\inf_{X \\succeq 0} \\left( \\langle C - \\mathcal{A}^{*}(y), X \\rangle + \\langle y, b \\rangle \\right).$$\nFor the infimum over $X \\succeq 0$ to be finite, we must have $C - \\mathcal{A}^{*}(y) \\succeq 0$; otherwise, since $\\langle C - \\mathcal{A}^{*}(y), X \\rangle$ can be made arbitrarily negative by scaling a direction in the positive semidefinite cone, $g(y) = -\\infty$. When $C - \\mathcal{A}^{*}(y) \\succeq 0$, the infimum over $X \\succeq 0$ of the linear form $\\langle C - \\mathcal{A}^{*}(y), X \\rangle$ is $0$ (achieved at $X = 0$), hence\n$$g(y) = \\begin{cases}\n\\langle y, b \\rangle, & \\text{if } C - \\mathcal{A}^{*}(y) \\succeq 0, \\\\\n-\\infty, & \\text{otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}$$\nTherefore, the dual problem is\n$$\\max_{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}} \\ \\langle y, b \\rangle \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad C - \\mathcal{A}^{*}(y) \\succeq 0.$$\nWith $C = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\mathcal{A}^{*}(y) = y_{1} E_{11} + y_{2} E_{22}$, the dual constraint becomes\n$$C - \\mathcal{A}^{*}(y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} y_{1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & y_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -y_{1} & 1 \\\\ 1 & -y_{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\succeq 0.$$\nThe dual objective is $\\langle y, b \\rangle = y_{1} \\cdot 0 + y_{2} \\cdot 1 = y_{2}$. Hence the dual problem is\n$$\\max \\ y_{2} \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad \\begin{pmatrix} -y_{1} & 1 \\\\ 1 & -y_{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\succeq 0.$$\n\nWe now compute the primal and dual optimal values. For the primal, the unique feasible matrix is\n$$X^{\\star} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix},$$\nand the primal objective value is\n$$p^{\\star} = \\langle C, X^{\\star} \\rangle = \\operatorname{tr}(C X^{\\star}) = \\operatorname{tr}\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\operatorname{tr}\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = 0.$$\n\nFor the dual, we analyze the positive semidefiniteness of the $2 \\times 2$ symmetric matrix\n$$M(y) = \\begin{pmatrix} -y_{1} & 1 \\\\ 1 & -y_{2} \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nA $2 \\times 2$ symmetric matrix is positive semidefinite if and only if both diagonal entries are nonnegative and the determinant is nonnegative. Thus we need\n$$-y_{1} \\ge 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -y_{2} \\ge 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\det(M(y)) = (-y_{1})(-y_{2}) - 1 = y_{1} y_{2} - 1 \\ge 0.$$\nEquivalently,\n$$y_{1} \\le 0, \\quad y_{2} \\le 0, \\quad y_{1} y_{2} \\ge 1.$$\nWe aim to maximize $y_{2}$ subject to these constraints. Because $y_{2} \\le 0$, the dual objective is bounded above by $0$. The product constraint $y_{1} y_{2} \\ge 1$ with $y_{1} \\le 0$ and $y_{2} \\le 0$ implies\n$$y_{2} \\le \\frac{1}{y_{1}},$$\nsince dividing both sides of $y_{1} y_{2} \\ge 1$ by $y_{1} \\le 0$ reverses the inequality. For any feasible $y_{1} \\le 0$, we have $1/y_{1} < 0$, so the tightest upper bound for $y_{2}$ is the minimum of $0$ and $1/y_{1}$, i.e.,\n$$y_{2} \\le \\min\\left(0, \\frac{1}{y_{1}}\\right).$$\nAs $y_{1} \\to -\\infty$, $\\frac{1}{y_{1}} \\to 0^{-}$, so the supremum of feasible $y_{2}$ values is $0$, but it is not attained because $y_{2} = 0$ would violate $y_{1} y_{2} \\ge 1$. Thus the dual optimal value is\n$$d^{\\star} = 0.$$\n\nFinally, the duality gap is\n$$p^{\\star} - d^{\\star} = 0 - 0 = 0.$$\nThis example exhibits failure of Slater’s condition (no strictly feasible primal point) while still having a zero duality gap; the dual supremum is not attained.\n\nTherefore, the requested explicit duality gap is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3123532"}]}
