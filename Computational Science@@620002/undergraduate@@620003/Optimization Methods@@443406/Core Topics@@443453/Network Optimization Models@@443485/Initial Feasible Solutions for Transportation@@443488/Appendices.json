Let the supplies be $S_{1}=20$, $S_{2}=30$, $S_{3}=25$, and the demands be $D_{1}=15$, $D_{2}=25$, $D_{3}=20$, $D_{4}=15$. The per-unit transportation cost is constant across all source–destination pairs, with $c_{ij}=5$ for every $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ and $j \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$. The task is to construct initial basic feasible solutions using three standard heuristics—Northwest Corner Method (NWCM), Least Cost Method (LCM), and Vogel’s Approximation Method (VAM)—and then determine the optimal total transportation cost.\n\nTo remove ambiguity, follow these deterministic tie-breaking conventions:\n- For the Northwest Corner Method, proceed in the usual fashion from the top-left corner.\n- For the Least Cost Method, when multiple cells have the same lowest $c_{ij}$, choose the destination with the largest remaining demand; if still tied, choose the source with the smallest index, then the destination with the smallest index. Allocate the maximum feasible shipment to the chosen cell, update supply and demand, and repeat until all demands are met.\n- For Vogel’s Approximation Method, compute row and column penalties as usual. When penalties tie at zero (or otherwise tie), choose the line (row or column) with the largest remaining total (supply for rows, demand for columns); if still tied, choose the smallest index. Within the chosen line, select the cell with the lowest $c_{ij}$; if cells tie, choose the one that permits the largest allocation; if still tied, choose the smallest index. Allocate the maximum feasible shipment to that cell and update.\n\nStarting only from the foundational definition of the transportation problem—its linear objective and flow conservation constraints—justify rigorously whether each heuristic’s initial basic feasible solution is optimal under the given cost structure, and compute the minimal total transportation cost achieved by any optimal basic feasible solution.\n\nExpress the final cost in dollars, and give your answer as a single real number. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement is valid. It is a well-posed, balanced transportation problem with all necessary data provided. The tie-breaking rules ensure a deterministic application of the heuristics. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe transportation problem is defined as a linear program seeking to minimize the total cost of shipping goods from $m$ sources to $n$ destinations. Let $x_{ij}$ be the quantity of goods shipped from source $i$ to destination $j$. The objective function to be minimized is the total transportation cost, $Z$, given by:\n$$Z = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} c_{ij} x_{ij}$$\nwhere $c_{ij}$ is the per-unit cost of shipping from source $i$ to destination $j$.\n\nThe constraints ensure that supply capacities are not exceeded and demands are met:\n1.  Supply constraints: $\\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{ij} = S_i$ for each source $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, m\\}$.\n2.  Demand constraints: $\\sum_{i=1}^{m} x_{ij} = D_j$ for each destination $j \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$.\n3.  Non-negativity: $x_{ij} \\geq 0$ for all $i, j$.\n\nIn this specific problem, we are given $m=3$ sources and $n=4$ destinations.\nThe supplies are $S_1=20$, $S_2=30$, and $S_3=25$. The total supply is $T_S = 20 + 30 + 25 = 75$.\nThe demands are $D_1=15$, $D_2=25$, $D_3=20$, and $D_4=15$. The total demand is $T_D = 15 + 25 + 20 + 15 = 75$.\nSince $T_S = T_D$, the problem is balanced. Let $T = T_S = T_D = 75$.\n\nThe critical feature of this problem is that the per-unit transportation cost $c_{ij}$ is a constant for all source-destination pairs: $c_{ij} = 5$ for all $i, j$.\nLet's substitute this constant cost, which we will denote as $c=5$, into the objective function:\n$$Z = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\sum_{j=1}^{4} c x_{ij} = c \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\sum_{j=1}^{4} x_{ij} \\right)$$\nFor any feasible solution $\\{x_{ij}\\}$ that satisfies the supply and demand constraints, the total quantity shipped can be calculated by summing all supply constraints or all demand constraints. Summing over the supply constraints:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{4} x_{ij} \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} S_i = T_S = 75$$\nThus, for any feasible solution, the total sum of allocations $\\sum_{i,j} x_{ij}$ is constant and equal to the total supply (and demand), $T$.\n\nSubstituting this result back into the objective function for $Z$:\n$$Z = c \\cdot T$$\nThis proves that the total transportation cost $Z$ is independent of the specific allocation pattern $\\{x_{ij}\\}$, as long as $\\{x_{ij}\\}$ constitutes a feasible solution. The cost is constant for every possible feasible solution.\nTherefore, every feasible solution is an optimal solution.\n\nWe can now compute this minimal (and only possible) total cost:\n$$Z_{opt} = c \\cdot T = 5 \\cdot 75 = 375$$\n\nThe problem asks to construct initial basic feasible solutions (BFS) using the Northwest Corner Method (NWCM), Least Cost Method (LCM), and Vogel’s Approximation Method (VAM) and to justify their optimality. A basic feasible solution is a specific type of feasible solution. Since every feasible solution is optimal, any BFS generated by these standard heuristics must also be optimal.\n\nTo demonstrate this conclusion concretely, we construct the BFS for each method according to the specified rules and verify their costs.\n\n1.  **Northwest Corner Method (NWCM):**\n    Following the standard procedure from the top-left cell $(1,1)$, the resulting allocation is:\n    $x_{11} = 15$, $x_{12} = 5$, $x_{22} = 20$, $x_{23} = 10$, $x_{33} = 10$, $x_{34} = 15$. All other $x_{ij} = 0$.\n    The total cost is:\n    $Z_{NWCM} = 5(15) + 5(5) + 5(20) + 5(10) + 5(10) + 5(15) = 5(15+5+20+10+10+15) = 5(75) = 375$.\n    As predicted, this cost is the optimal cost.\n\n2.  **Least Cost Method (LCM):**\n    With all $c_{ij}=5$, the choice of cell is determined entirely by the tie-breaking rules. Applying these rules, the resulting allocation is:\n    $x_{12} = 20$, $x_{21} = 10$, $x_{23} = 20$, $x_{31} = 5$, $x_{32} = 5$, $x_{34} = 15$. All other $x_{ij} = 0$.\n    The total cost is:\n    $Z_{LCM} = 5(20) + 5(10) + 5(20) + 5(5) + 5(5) + 5(15) = 5(20+10+20+5+5+15) = 5(75) = 375$.\n    This solution is also optimal.\n\n3.  **Vogel’s Approximation Method (VAM):**\n    The row and column penalties (differences between the two smallest costs) are all $5-5=0$. The choice is again dictated by the tie-breaking rules. The resulting allocation is:\n    $x_{11} = 15$, $x_{14} = 5$, $x_{22} = 25$, $x_{24} = 5$, $x_{33} = 20$, $x_{34} = 5$. All other $x_{ij} = 0$.\n    The total cost is:\n    $Z_{VAM} = 5(15) + 5(5) + 5(25) + 5(5) + 5(20) + 5(5) = 5(15+5+25+5+20+5) = 5(75) = 375$.\n    This solution is also optimal.\n\nIn conclusion, the special cost structure ($c_{ij}$ is constant) renders the choice of allocation strategy irrelevant to the total cost. Any method that produces a feasible solution will yield the same, optimal total cost. The rigorous justification for the optimality of each heuristic's solution lies not in the mechanics of the heuristics themselves, but in the fundamental nature of the objective function for this specific problem. The minimal total transportation cost is uniquely determined by the product of the constant unit cost and the total volume of goods to be shipped.\n\nThe minimal total transportation cost is $Z_{opt} = 375$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{375}$$", "id": "3138308"}, {"introduction": "Most real-world problems lack the simple structure of our first exercise.

The cost matrix is a member of the parametric family\n$$\nc_{i,j}(\\gamma)=a_{i}+b_{j}+\\gamma\\, i j,\\quad i\\in\\{1,2,3\\},\\ j\\in\\{1,2,3\\},\n$$\nwith fixed vectors $\\mathbf{a}=(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3})=(7,8,9)$ and $\\mathbf{b}=(b_{1},b_{2},b_{3})=(4,6,8)$, and a scalar parameter $\\gamma<0$.\n\n- Using only the Monge inequality and standard linear programming optimality notions such as dual feasibility and complementary slackness, first verify that for any $\\gamma<0$ this cost matrix is Monge, and explain why the Northwest (NW) corner basic feasible solution produced by the NW corner rule is an optimal solution for the transportation problem.\n\n- Specialize to $\\gamma=-1$ and explicitly construct the NW corner basic feasible solution for the given supplies and demands. Then, keeping all other costs fixed, perturb the single nonbasic entry at position $(1,3)$ by decreasing it by an amount $\\delta\\ge 0$, i.e., define a perturbed cost $c'_{1,3}=c_{1,3}-\\delta$ while $c'_{i,j}=c_{i,j}$ for all $(i,j)\\neq(1,3)$.\n\nUsing dual feasibility and reduced costs associated with the NW corner basic feasible solution of the unperturbed instance, determine the largest $\\delta$ for which the NW corner basic feasible solution remains optimal after the perturbation. Your final answer must be a single real number. Do not round your answer; report it exactly with no units.", "solution": "We begin from foundational definitions in optimization. A cost matrix $\\{c_{i,j}\\}$ is said to be Monge if for all $i<i'$ and $j<j'$ it satisfies the Monge inequality\n$$\nc_{i,j}+c_{i',j'}\\le c_{i,j'}+c_{i',j}.\n$$\nFor transportation problems with a Monge cost matrix, the greedy structure underlying the Northwest (NW) corner rule aligns with optimality; this can be seen through either known theorems on Monge arrays or by constructing dual variables (potentials) that satisfy dual feasibility and complementary slackness for the NW corner basic feasible solution. In the latter view, optimality of a basic feasible solution is certified when there exist potentials $\\{u_{i}\\}$ for sources and $\\{v_{j}\\}$ for destinations such that $u_{i}+v_{j}=c_{i,j}$ on all basic cells and $u_{i}+v_{j}\\le c_{i,j}$ on all nonbasic cells. Equivalently, the reduced costs $r_{i,j}=c_{i,j}-u_{i}-v_{j}$ are nonnegative for all cells, and zero on basic cells.\n\nStep 1: Verify the Monge property for the family $c_{i,j}(\\gamma)=a_{i}+b_{j}+\\gamma i j$ with $\\gamma<0$.\n\nLet $i<i'$ and $j<j'$. Consider\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Delta &\\equiv \\big(c_{i,j}+c_{i',j'}\\big)-\\big(c_{i,j'}+c_{i',j}\\big)\\\\\n&=\\big(a_{i}+b_{j}+\\gamma i j + a_{i'}+b_{j'}+\\gamma i' j'\\big)-\\big(a_{i}+b_{j'}+\\gamma i j' + a_{i'}+b_{j}+\\gamma i' j\\big)\\\\\n&=\\gamma\\big(ij+i'j'-ij'-i'j\\big)\\\\\n&=\\gamma\\big(i-i'\\big)\\big(j-j'\\big).\n\\end{align*}\nBecause $i<i'$ and $j<j'$, we have $\\big(i-i'\\big)<0$ and $\\big(j-j'\\big)<0$, so $\\big(i-i'\\big)\\big(j-j'\\big)>0$. With $\\gamma<0$, it follows that $\\Delta\\le 0$. Therefore $c_{i,j}+c_{i',j'}\\le c_{i,j'}+c_{i',j}$ holds for all $i<i'$ and $j<j'$, and the matrix is Monge.\n\nStep 2: Construct the NW corner basic feasible solution for the given supplies and demands (for any $\\gamma$, the NW rule depends only on supplies and demands). Starting at the northwest corner:\n\n- At $(1,1)$, allocate $\\min\\{s_{1},d_{1}\\}=\\min\\{20,10\\}=10$. Update $s_{1}\\leftarrow 10$, $d_{1}\\leftarrow 0$.\n- Move to $(1,2)$, allocate $\\min\\{s_{1},d_{2}\\}=\\min\\{10,35\\}=10$. Update $s_{1}\\leftarrow 0$, $d_{2}\\leftarrow 25$.\n- Move to $(2,2)$, allocate $\\min\\{s_{2},d_{2}\\}=\\min\\{30,25\\}=25$. Update $s_{2}\\leftarrow 5$, $d_{2}\\leftarrow 0$.\n- Move to $(2,3)$, allocate $\\min\\{s_{2},d_{3}\\}=\\min\\{5,30\\}=5$. Update $s_{2}\\leftarrow 0$, $d_{3}\\leftarrow 25$.\n- Move to $(3,3)$, allocate $\\min\\{s_{3},d_{3}\\}=\\min\\{25,25\\}=25$. Update $s_{3}\\leftarrow 0$, $d_{3}\\leftarrow 0$.\n\nThe NW corner basic feasible solution uses the basic cells $(1,1)$, $(1,2)$, $(2,2)$, $(2,3)$, $(3,3)$ with strictly positive allocations. This is nondegenerate because there are exactly $m+n-1=5$ basic cells with positive flow.\n\nStep 3: Specialize to $\\gamma=-1$ and compute the cost matrix. Using $a_{1}=7$, $a_{2}=8$, $a_{3}=9$, $b_{1}=4$, $b_{2}=6$, $b_{3}=8$, and $\\gamma=-1$, we obtain\n\\begin{align*}\nc_{1,1}&=7+4-1=10,\\quad &c_{1,2}&=7+6-2=11,\\quad &c_{1,3}&=7+8-3=12,\\\\\nc_{2,1}&=8+4-2=10,\\quad &c_{2,2}&=8+6-4=10,\\quad &c_{2,3}&=8+8-6=10,\\\\\nc_{3,1}&=9+4-3=10,\\quad &c_{3,2}&=9+6-6=9,\\quad &c_{3,3}&=9+8-9=8.\n\\end{align*}\n\nTo certify optimality of the NW corner basic feasible solution, we construct dual potentials $\\{u_{i}\\}$ and $\\{v_{j}\\}$ satisfying $u_{i}+v_{j}=c_{i,j}$ for each basic cell. Fix $u_{1}=0$ (one degree of freedom). Then from the basic cells:\n\n- $(1,1)$ gives $u_{1}+v_{1}=c_{1,1}=10\\Rightarrow v_{1}=10$.\n- $(1,2)$ gives $u_{1}+v_{2}=c_{1,2}=11\\Rightarrow v_{2}=11$.\n- $(2,2)$ gives $u_{2}+v_{2}=c_{2,2}=10\\Rightarrow u_{2}=10-v_{2}=-1$.\n- $(2,3)$ gives $u_{2}+v_{3}=c_{2,3}=10\\Rightarrow v_{3}=10-u_{2}=11$.\n- $(3,3)$ gives $u_{3}+v_{3}=c_{3,3}=8\\Rightarrow u_{3}=8-v_{3}=-3$.\n\nNow compute reduced costs on the nonbasic cells $(1,3)$, $(2,1)$, $(3,1)$, $(3,2)$:\n\\begin{align*}\nr_{1,3}&=c_{1,3}-u_{1}-v_{3}=12-0-11=1,\\\\\nr_{2,1}&=c_{2,1}-u_{2}-v_{1}=10-(-1)-10=1,\\\\\nr_{3,1}&=c_{3,1}-u_{3}-v_{1}=10-(-3)-10=3,\\\\\nr_{3,2}&=c_{3,2}-u_{3}-v_{2}=9-(-3)-11=1.\n\\end{align*}\nAll reduced costs are nonnegative, and thus the NW corner basic feasible solution is optimal by dual feasibility and complementary slackness.\n\nStep 4: Sensitivity to perturbation of a single nonbasic cost. Consider the perturbation on the nonbasic entry $(1,3)$ only:\n$$\nc'_{1,3}=c_{1,3}-\\delta,\\quad \\delta\\ge 0,\\qquad c'_{i,j}=c_{i,j}\\ \\text{for all}\\ (i,j)\\neq (1,3).\n$$\nBecause the basis (set of basic cells) is unchanged and only a nonbasic cost is perturbed, the dual potentials $\\{u_{i}\\}$ and $\\{v_{j}\\}$ computed from equalities on basic cells remain the same. Therefore the only reduced cost that changes is $r_{1,3}$, which becomes\n$$\nr'_{1,3}=c'_{1,3}-u_{1}-v_{3}=(c_{1,3}-\\delta)-u_{1}-v_{3}=r_{1,3}-\\delta=1-\\delta.\n$$\nThe NW corner basic feasible solution remains optimal if and only if all reduced costs remain nonnegative. Since the other reduced costs are unchanged and already positive, the condition reduces to $1-\\delta\\ge 0$, i.e., $\\delta\\le 1$.\n\nThus, the largest $\\delta$ for which the NW corner basic feasible solution remains optimal is\n$$\n\\delta^{\\star}=1.\n$$\nNo rounding is required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3138339"}]}
