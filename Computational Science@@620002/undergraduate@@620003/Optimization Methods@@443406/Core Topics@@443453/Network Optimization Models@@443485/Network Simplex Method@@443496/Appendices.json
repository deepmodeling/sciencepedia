Feasible basic solutions assign flows $y_{ij}$ on tree arcs so that the node balance equations with $b'_{v}$ are satisfied, while non-tree arcs are at one of their bounds (either $y_{ij}=0$ or $y_{ij}=u'_{ij}$). In terms of the original variables $x_{ij}$, arcs with $y_{ij}=0$ correspond to $x_{ij}=l_{ij}$, meaning these arcs sit at their lower bounds; arcs with $y_{ij}=u'_{ij}$ correspond to $x_{ij}=u_{ij}$, sitting at their upper bounds; and tree arcs carry interior flows $x_{ij}=l_{ij}+y_{ij}$ adjusted to satisfy the transformed balances. Thus, the spanning tree structure in the transformed network directly encodes the basis for the original lower-bound problem, with the fixed lower-bound flows incorporated into $b'_{v}$ and the variable part $y_{ij}$ handled by the tree.\n\nThe requested scalar constant added to the objective after transformation is $K=27$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{27}$$", "id": "3156453"}, {"introduction": "At the heart of the Network Simplex Method is the pivot: a systematic process of improving a solution by rerouting flow along a cost-reducing cycle.

If any $\\bar{c}_{ij} < 0$, the arc $(i,j)$ is a candidate to enter the basis to reduce the total cost.\n\nLet's compute the reduced cost for the nonbasic arc $(C_2, T_2)$ using the formula $\\bar{c}_{ij} = c_{ij} + \\pi_i - \\pi_j$:\n$$ \\bar{c}_{C_2T_2} = c_{C_2T_2} + \\pi_{C_2} - \\pi_{T_2} $$\nUsing the given cost $c_{C_2T_2} = 2$ and the computed potentials $\\pi_{C_2} = -7, \\pi_{T_2} = 0$:\n$$ \\bar{c}_{C_2T_2} = 2 + (-7) - 0 = -5 $$\nSince $\\bar{c}_{C_2T_2} = -5 < 0$, introducing flow on arc $(C_2, T_2)$ will decrease the total cost at a rate of $5$ units of cost per unit of flow.

The basis tree consists of arcs $(C_1, T_1)$, $(C_2, T_1)$, $(T_1, D)$, and $(T_2, D)$. The path in the tree between nodes $C_2$ and $T_2$ is $C_2 \\to T_1 \\to D \\leftarrow T_2$. The cycle is thus $C_2 \\to T_2 \\to D \\leftarrow T_1 \\leftarrow C_2$.\n\n2.  **Adjust Flows:** We push $\\theta$ units of flow along this cycle. Forward arcs (in the direction of the cycle push from $C_2$ to $T_2$) have their flow increased, and backward arcs have their flow decreased.\n    - Path from $C_2$ to $T_2$ is $C_2 \\to T_2$. Add $\\theta$ flow.\n    - Path from $T_2$ back to $C_2$ through the tree is $T_2 \\to D \\leftarrow T_1 \\leftarrow C_2$.\n    - The flow changes are:\n        - $x_{C_2T_2}$ (entering): $0 \\to 0 + \\theta$\n        - $x_{T_2D}$ (forward on path $T_2 \\to D$): $0 \\to 0 + \\theta$\n        - $x_{T_1D}$ (backward on path $D \\leftarrow T_1$): $2 \\to 2 - \\theta$\n        - $x_{C_2T_1}$ (backward on path $T_1 \\leftarrow C_2$): $1 \\to 1 - \\theta$\n    - The flow on the other basic arc, $x_{C_1T_1}$, is unaffected as it's not in the cycle.\n\n3.  **Determine $\\theta$ and Leaving Arc:** The problem states to send $\\theta = 1$ unit of flow. We can verify this is the correct amount. The maximum value for $\\theta$ is limited by the flows on backward arcs, which must remain non-negative:\n    - $x'_{T_1D} = 2 - \\theta \\ge 0 \\implies \\theta \\le 2$\n    - $x'_{C_2T_1} = 1 - \\theta \\ge 0 \\implies \\theta \\le 1$\n    - The maximum possible value is $\\theta = \\min(2, 1) = 1$. The arc that limits the flow increase is $(C_2, T_1)$, as its flow drops to zero. This is the leaving arc.\n\n4.  **Calculate New Flows and Cost:** With $\\theta=1$, the new flows are:\n    - $x'_{C_2T_2} = 0 + 1 = 1$\n    - $x'_{T_2D} = 0 + 1 = 1$\n    - $x'_{T_1D} = 2 - 1 = 1$\n    - $x'_{C_2T_1} = 1 - 1 = 0$ (becomes non-basic)\n    - $x'_{C_1T_1} = 1$ (unchanged)\n\n    The new set of arcs with positive flow is $\\{(C_1, T_1), (C_2, T_2), (T_1, D), (T_2, D)\\}$.\n    The new total cost, $Z_{new}$, is calculated using these new flows and their respective costs:\n    $$ Z_{new} = (c_{C_1T_1} \\times x'_{C_1T_1}) + (c_{C_2T_2} \\times x'_{C_2T_2}) + (c_{T_1D} \\times x'_{T_1D}) + (c_{T_2D} \\times x'_{T_2D}) $$\n    $$ Z_{new} = (1 \\times 1) + (2 \\times 1) + (0 \\times 1) + (0 \\times 1) $$\n    $$ Z_{new} = 1 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 3 $$\n\nThe cost change can also be confirmed as $\\Delta Z = \\theta \\times \\bar{c}_{C_2T_2} = 1 \\times (-5) = -5$.

The potentials are determined by the condition that for every basic arc $(i,j)$ in the basic spanning tree $B$, the reduced cost $\\bar{c}_{ij} = c_{ij} + \\pi_i - \\pi_j$ must be zero. The given basic spanning tree is $B=\\{(1,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,5)\\}$. This gives us a system of $|N|-1 = 4$ linear equations in $|N|=5$ variables. We can set one potential arbitrarily. Let us set $\\pi_1 = 0$.\n\nThe system of equations is:\n1. For basic arc $(1,2)$: $c_{12} + \\pi_1 - \\pi_2 = 0$. With $c_{12}=4$ and $\\pi_1=0$, we have $4 + 0 - \\pi_2 = 0$, which yields $\\pi_2 = 4$.\n2. For basic arc $(2,3)$: $c_{23} + \\pi_2 - \\pi_3 = 0$.

Pushing flow $\\theta$ along the entering arc $(1,3)$ means its flow increases. This is a forward arc in the cycle. To maintain flow conservation, this flow must be routed back from node $3$ to node $1$ along the tree path $3 \\to 2 \\to 1$. This involves traversing arcs $(2,3)$ and $(1,2)$ in the reverse direction of their orientation in the network.\n- The flow on the forward arc $(1,3)$ increases: $x'_{13} = x_{13} + \\theta = 0 + \\theta$.\n- The flow on the backward arc $(2,3)$ decreases: $x'_{23} = x_{23} - \\theta = 5 - \\theta$.\n- The flow on the backward arc $(1,2)$ decreases: $x'_{12} = x_{12} - \\theta = 8 - \\theta$.\n\nThe value of the augmentation $\\theta$ is the maximum possible value that preserves the flow feasibility, i.e., $0 \\le x'_{ij} \\le U_{ij}$ for all arcs in the cycle.\n- For the forward arc $(1,3)$: $x'_{13} \\le U_{13} \\implies 0 + \\theta \\le 10 \\implies \\theta \\le 10$.\n- For the backward arc $(2,3)$: $x'_{23} \\ge 0 \\implies 5 - \\theta \\ge 0 \\implies \\theta \\le 5$.\n- For the backward arc $(1,2)$: $x'_{12} \\ge 0 \\implies 8 - \\theta \\ge 0 \\implies \\theta \\le 8$.\n\nCombining these constraints, the maximum possible value for $\\theta$ is the minimum of these upper bounds:\n$$\n\\theta = \\min(10, 5, 8) = 5\n$$\nThe leaving arc is the one whose constraint is active, which is arc $(2,3)$ as its flow becomes $5 - 5 = 0$.\n\nFinally, the total change in the objective cost, $\\Delta Z$, is the product of the reduced cost of the entering arc and the amount of flow augmentation $\\theta$.\n$$\n\\Delta Z = \\bar{c}_{13} \\times \\theta\n$$\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$$\n\\Delta Z = (-6) \\times 5 = -30\n$$\nThe total cost decreases by $30$. The problem asks for the magnitude of this decrease, which is $|\\Delta Z|$.\n$$\n|\\Delta Z| = |-30| = 30\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{30}$$", "id": "3156406"}]}
