Second, to create a practical plan where experiments are either fully funded or not at all, they round the proportional solution: any experiment with a proportional funding level of 0.5 or greater is set to be fully funded (ON), and any level below 0.5 is set to NOT funded (OFF).

The goal is to find the amount by which the addition of an odd-cycle inequality tightens the relaxation's bound.\n\nFirst, we analyze the initial LP relaxation. The integer program for the maximum stable set problem on $G$ is given by:\nMaximize $\\sum_{i=1}^{5} x_{i}$\nSubject to:\n$x_{i} + x_{j} \\leq 1$ for each $(i,j) \\in E$\n$x_{i} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ for each $i \\in V$\n\nThe initial LP relaxation is formed by relaxing the integrality constraint $x_{i} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ to a continuous range $0 \\leq x_{i} \\leq 1$. Let the optimal value of this relaxation be $Z_{1}^{*}$.

Consider the symmetric solution where $x_{i} = c$ for all $i \\in V$. The edge constraints become $c+c \\leq 1$, which means $2c \\leq 1$, or $c \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$. To maximize the objective function $\\sum x_{i} = 5c$, we should choose the largest possible value for $c$, which is $c = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nLet's verify the solution $x_{1}=x_{2}=x_{3}=x_{4}=x_{5}=\\frac{1}{2}$.\nEach edge constraint $x_{i} + x_{j} \\leq 1$ becomes $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 \\leq 1$, which is satisfied.\nThe variable bounds $0 \\leq \\frac{1}{2} \\leq 1$ are also satisfied.\nThus, this is a feasible solution.

This immediately establishes an upper bound on the optimal value: $Z_{2}^{*} \\leq 2$.\nTo determine if this upper bound is achievable, we need to find a feasible solution with an objective value of $2$. The actual maximum stable set size of a $5$-cycle is $2$. For example, the set of vertices $\\{1,3\\}$ is a stable set. This corresponds to an integer solution: $x_{1}=1$, $x_{3}=1$, and $x_{2}=x_{4}=x_{5}=0$.\nLet's check if this solution is feasible for the strengthened LP.\n- The objective value is $1+0+1+0+0 = 2$.\n- The edge constraints are:\n  - $x_{1}+x_{2} = 1+0 = 1 \\leq 1$ (satisfied)\n  - $x_{2}+x_{3} = 0+1 = 1 \\leq 1$ (satisfied)\n  - $x_{3}+x_{4} = 1+0 = 1 \\leq 1$ (satisfied)\n  - $x_{4}+x_{5} = 0+0 = 0 \\leq 1$ (satisfied)\n  - $x_{5}+x_{1} = 0+1 = 1 \\leq 1$ (satisfied)\n- The odd-cycle constraint is $\\sum x_{i} = 2 \\leq 2$ (satisfied).\n- The variable bounds $0 \\leq x_{i} \\leq 1$ are satisfied, as all variables are either $0$ or $1$.\nSince this is a feasible solution and its objective value of $2$ matches the upper bound, it is an optimal solution.\nTherefore, the optimal value of the strengthened LP relaxation is $Z_{2}^{*} = 2$.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the amount by which the upper bound on the maximum stable set size decreases when the odd-cycle inequality is added.
