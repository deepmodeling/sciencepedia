A maximization of a function $z$ is equivalent to the minimization of its negative, $-z$.\nLet $z' = -z = -(5x_1 - 3x_2 + x_3 + x_4 - 2x_5)$.\nThe new objective function is:\n$$ \\min\\; z' = -5x_1 + 3x_2 - x_3 - x_4 + 2x_5 $$\n\n**Step 2: Convert the Sign Restrictions**\nThe standard form requires all variables to be non-negative. We will introduce new variables to replace those that do not meet this criterion.\n\n- The variables $x_1$ and $x_4$ already satisfy the non-negativity constraint, $x_1 \\ge 0$ and $x_4 \\ge 0$. We will let $y_1 = x_1$ and $y_5 = x_4$.\n\n- The variable $x_2$ is non-positive, $x_2 \\le 0$. We introduce a new variable $y_2 \\ge 0$ such that $x_2 = -y_2$. This substitution ensures non-negativity for the new variable.\n\n- The variables $x_3$ and $x_5$ are unrestricted in sign (free). Any free variable can be expressed as the difference of two non-negative variables.\nFor $x_3$, we introduce $y_3 \\ge 0$ and $y_4 \\ge 0$, such that $x_3 = y_3 - y_4$.\nFor $x_5$, we introduce $y_6 \\ge 0$ and $y_7 \\ge 0$, such that $x_5 = y_6 - y_7$.\n\nThe conversion of the original five variables ($x_1, \\dots, x_5$) necessitates a total of $1+1+2+1+2 = 7$ new non-negative variables.\n\n**Step 3: Convert the Constraints to Equalities**\nThe standard form requires all constraints to be equalities. We introduce slack and surplus variables to convert the inequalities.\n\n- The first constraint is a 'less than or equal to' inequality:\n$$ 2x_1 - x_2 + 3x_3 - x_4 + x_5 \\le 7 $$\nTo convert this to an equality, we add a non-negative **slack variable**, which we will call $y_8$.\n$$ 2x_1 - x_2 + 3x_3 - x_4 + x_5 + y_8 = 7, \\quad \\text{with } y_8 \\ge 0 $$\n\n- The second constraint is a 'greater than or equal to' inequality:\n$$ -x_1 + 4x_2 + x_3 + 2x_4 - 3x_5 \\ge 5 $$\nTo convert this to an equality, we subtract a non-negative **surplus variable**, which we will call $y_9$.\n$$ -x_1 + 4x_2 + x_3 + 2x_4 - 3x_5 - y_9 = 5, \\quad \\text{with } y_9 \\ge 0 $$\n\n- The third constraint is already an equality, so no new variables are needed for its conversion.\n$$ 3x_1 - 2x_2 + x_4 - x_5 = -2 $$\n\nThe conversion of the inequality constraints introduces $1+1=2$ new non-negative variables.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Standard-Form Problem**\nWe now substitute the new variables defined in Step 2 into the objective function from Step 1 and the constraints from Step 3.\n\nSubstitutions:\n$x_1 = y_1$\n$x_2 = -y_2$\n$x_3 = y_3 - y_4$\n$x_4 = y_5$\n$x_5 = y_6 - y_7$\n\nThe objective function becomes:\n$$ \\min\\; z' = -5(y_1) + 3(-y_2) - (y_3 - y_4) - (y_5) + 2(y_6 - y_7) $$\n$$ \\min\\; z' = -5y_1 - 3y_2 - y_3 + y_4 - y_5 + 2y_6 - 2y_7 + 0y_8 + 0y_9 $$\n\nThe constraints become:\n1. $2(y_1) - (-y_2) + 3(y_3 - y_4) - (y_5) + (y_6 - y_7) + y_8 = 7$\n   $2y_1 + y_2 + 3y_3 - 3y_4 - y_5 + y_6 - y_7 + y_8 = 7$\n\n2. $-(y_1) + 4(-y_2) + (y_3 - y_4) + 2(y_5) - 3(y_6 - y_7) - y_9 = 5$\n   $-y_1 - 4y_2 + y_3 - y_4 + 2y_5 - 3y_6 + 3y_7 - y_9 = 5$\n\n3. $3(y_1) - 2(-y_2) + (y_5) - (y_6 - y_7) = -2$\n   $3y_1 + 2y_2 + y_5 - y_6 + y_7 = -2$\n\nThe complete variable vector in standard form is $\\mathbf{y} = (y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4, y_5, y_6, y_7, y_8, y_9)^\\top$, with the condition $\\mathbf{y} \\ge \\mathbf{0}$.\n\n**Step 5: Count the Total Number of Variables**\nThe question asks for the total number of variables in the final vector $\\mathbf{y}$.

The task is to analyze the consequences of the error, which is a well-posed analytical problem. A unique and meaningful solution exists.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, objective mathematical language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\nThe problem contains no scientific or factual unsoundness, is formalizable and relevant to optimization methods, has a complete and consistent setup for the purpose of analysis, is not unrealistic in its mathematical context, and is not ill-posed. The contradiction introduced by the student is the subject of analysis, not a flaw in the problem statement itself.\n\n**Verdict**: The problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Analysis of the Original and Converted Systems**\n\n**Original System Feasibility:**\nThe constraints are $x_1 + 2x_2 \\ge 4$ and $x_1 + 2x_2 = 6$, with $x_1 \\ge 0, x_2 \\ge 0$.\nThe equality constraint $x_1 + 2x_2 = 6$ dictates the value of the expression $x_1 + 2x_2$. Substituting this into the inequality constraint gives $6 \\ge 4$, which is a tautology. Therefore, the first constraint is redundant. The feasible region is defined by the set of points $(x_1, x_2)$ such that $x_1 + 2x_2 = 6$, $x_1 \\ge 0$, and $x_2 \\ge 0$. This is the line segment connecting the points $(6, 0)$ and $(0, 3)$. Since this set is non-empty, the original LP is **feasible**.\n\n**Student's Converted System Feasibility:**\nThe student's constraints are $x_1 + 2x_2 + s_1 = 4$ and $x_1 + 2x_2 = 6$, with $x_1, x_2, s_1 \\ge 0$.\nFrom the second constraint, we have $x_1 + 2x_2 = 6$. Substituting this into the first constraint yields:\n$$6 + s_1 = 4$$\nThis implies $s_1 = 4 - 6 = -2$.\nHowever, the student introduced $s_1$ as a nonnegative variable, i.e., $s_1 \\ge 0$. The result $s_1 = -2$ contradicts the condition $s_1 \\ge 0$. Thus, there is no solution $(x_1, x_2, s_1)$ that satisfies all constraints simultaneously. The student's converted system is **infeasible**.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. The equality $x_1 + 2x_2 + s_1 = 4$ with $s_1 \\ge 0$ encodes $x_1 + 2x_2 \\le 4$, not $x_1 + 2x_2 \\ge 4$, so together with $x_1 + 2x_2 = 6$ it renders the converted system infeasible even though the original system is feasible.**\n\n- The equation $x_1 + 2x_2 + s_1 = 4$ can be rewritten as $x_1 + 2x_2 = 4 - s_1$. Since $s_1 \\ge 0$, it follows that $4 - s_1 \\le 4$. Therefore, this equality correctly encodes the inequality $x_1 + 2x_2 \\le 4$. The student has used a *slack* variable, which is appropriate for a '$\\le$' constraint, on a '$\\ge$' constraint. This part of the statement is correct.\n- The student's system thus requires that $x_1 + 2x_2 \\le 4$ and $x_1 + 2x_2 = 6$ both hold. It is impossible for a quantity to be simultaneously equal to $6$ and less than or equal to $4$. As demonstrated in the analysis above, this renders the converted system infeasible. This part of the statement is correct.\n- As also shown above, the original system is feasible. This part of the statement is correct.\n- The entire statement accurately describes the student's error, its logical implication, and the resulting infeasibility, contrasting it with the feasibility of the original problem.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. A correct equality conversion of the first constraint is $x_1 + 2x_2 - s_1 = 4$ with $s_1 \\ge 0$, or equivalently $-x_1 - 2x_2 + s_1 = -4$ with $s_1 \\ge 0$.**\n\n- The first constraint is $x_1 + 2x_2 \\ge 4$. This means the left-hand side exceeds the right-hand side by some non-negative amount. To form an equality, one must subtract this non-negative amount, called a *surplus* or *excess* variable, from the left-hand side.\n- Let $s_1 \\ge 0$ be this surplus variable. The correct conversion is $x_1 + 2x_2 - s_1 = 4$. This part of the statement is correct.\n- Multiplying the equation $x_1 + 2x_2 - s_1 = 4$ by $-1$ on both sides yields $- (x_1 + 2x_2 - s_1) = -4$, which simplifies to $-x_1 - 2x_2 + s_1 = -4$. This is a valid algebraic manipulation and is equivalent to the first form. The condition $s_1 \\ge 0$ remains.\n- The statement presents the standard correct method for converting a '$\\ge$' inequality into an equality.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. In the correct dual of the original maximization problem, the dual variable associated with the first constraint must satisfy $y_1 \\le 0$; treating that constraint as a “less-than-or-equal” and taking $y_1 \\ge 0$ is a dual sign error.**\n\n- Standard primal-dual relationships for a maximization problem are as follows:\n    - A '$\\le$' constraint corresponds to a non-negative ($y_i \\ge 0$) dual variable.\n    - A '$\\ge$' constraint corresponds to a non-positive ($y_i \\le 0$) dual variable.\n    - An '$=$' constraint corresponds to an unrestricted in sign ($y_i$ URS) dual variable.\n- The original problem is a maximization problem. Its first constraint is $x_1 + 2x_2 \\ge 4$, which is a '$\\ge$' type. Therefore, the corresponding dual variable, let's call it $y_1$, must be non-positive, i.e., $y_1 \\le 0$. The first part of the statement is correct.\n- The student's error was to effectively treat the first constraint as $x_1 + 2x_2 \\le 4$. If one were to carry this mistake into the dual formulation, they would associate a non-negative dual variable ($y_1 \\ge 0$) with this '$\\le$' constraint. This would be a sign error in the dual problem. The second part of the statement correctly identifies this potential a dual sign error.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Because the right-hand sides are nonnegative, adding a nonnegative slack with a plus sign to any constraint never changes the feasible region.**\n\n- This statement is a broad generalization. Let's test it against the problem's first constraint, $x_1 + 2x_2 \\ge 4$. The student added a non-negative slack variable with a plus sign, which resulted in the equation $x_1 + 2x_2 + s_1 = 4$ with $s_1 \\ge 0$. As established in the analysis of option A, this is equivalent to the inequality $x_1 + 2x_2 \\le 4$.\n- The original feasible region for this constraint is the half-plane defined by $x_1 + 2x_2 \\ge 4$. The new feasible region is the half-plane defined by $x_1 + 2x_2 \\le 4$. These two regions are distinct and only share the boundary line $x_1 + 2x_2 = 4$.\n- Therefore, adding a slack variable with a plus sign to a '$\\ge$' constraint fundamentally changes the feasible region. The statement is false. The condition \"Because the right-hand sides are nonnegative\" is irrelevant to this logical error; the transformation from '$\\ge$' to '$\\le$' would occur regardless of the sign of the right-hand side.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "3184565"}, {"introduction": "Theory meets practice in this final exercise, which applies conversion techniques to a realistic fuel blending problem.

Introducing Slack and Surplus Variables**\n\nWe convert the remaining inequalities into equalities by introducing non-negative slack and surplus variables.\n\nThe two-sided octane constraint is split into two inequalities:\n1. $87 x'_1 + 90 x'_2 + 96 x'_3 + 110 x'_4 \\geq 55$\n2. $87 x'_1 + 90 x'_2 + 96 x'_3 + 110 x'_4 \\leq 57$\n\nWe introduce a surplus variable $s_{o1} \\geq 0$ for the first inequality and a slack variable $s_{o2} \\geq 0$ for the second:\n1. $87 x'_1 + 90 x'_2 + 96 x'_3 + 110 x'_4 - s_{o1} = 55$\n2. $87 x'_1 + 90 x'_2 + 96 x'_3 + 110 x'_4 + s_{o2} = 57$\n\nThe upper-bound inequalities for $x'_i$ are converted using slack variables $s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4 \\geq 0$:\n- $x'_1 \\leq 0.4 \\implies x'_1 + s_1 = 0.4$\n- $x'_2 \\leq 0.4 \\implies x'_2 + s_2 = 0.4$\n- $x'_3 \\leq 0.3 \\implies x'_3 + s_3 = 0.3$\n- $x'_4 \\leq 0.3 \\implies x'_4 + s_4 = 0.3$\n\n**d. The Standard Form LP**\n\nThe standard-form problem is defined by the decision variable vector $z$, the cost vector $c_{std}$, the constraint matrix $A$, and the right-hand side vector $b$.\n\nThe vector of variables is $z = (x'_1, x'_2, x'_3, x'_4, s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4, s_{o1}, s_{o2})^{\\top}$. There are a total of $10$ variables, all required to be non-negative ($z \\geq 0$).\n\nThe objective function is:\n$$ \\text{minimize } c_{std}^{\\top} z = 1.04 x'_1 + 1.12 x'_2 + 1.31 x'_3 + 1.18 x'_4 + 0 s_1 + \\dots + 0 s_{o2} $$\n\nThe system of equality constraints $Az = b$ consists of $7$ equations:\n1. $x'_1 + x'_2 + x'_3 + x'_4 = 0.6$\n2. $87 x'_1 + 90 x'_2 + 96 x'_3 + 110 x'_4 - s_{o1} = 55$\n3. $87 x'_1 + 90 x'_2 + 96 x'_3 + 110 x'_4 + s_{o2} = 57$\n4. $x'_1 + s_1 = 0.4$\n5. $x'_2 + s_2 = 0.4$\n6. $x'_3 + s_3 = 0.3$\n7. $x'_4 + s_4 = 0.3$\n\nThe constraint matrix $A$ is a $7 \\times 10$ matrix, and $b$ is a $7 \\times 1$ vector:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1  &  1  &  1  &  1  & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &  0  &  0 \\\\\n87 & 90  & 96  & 110 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1  &  0 \\\\\n87 & 90  & 96  & 110 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &  0  &  1 \\\\\n1  &  0  &  0  &  0  & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 &  0  &  0 \\\\\n0  &  1  &  0  &  0  & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 &  0  &  0 \\\\\n0  &  0  &  1  &  0  & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 &  0  &  0 \\\\\n0  &  0  &  0  &  1  & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 &  0  &  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\quad\nb = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0.6 \\\\ 55 \\\\ 57 \\\\ 0.4 \\\\ 0.4 \\\\ 0.3 \\\\ 0.3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis completes the conversion to standard form.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Sum Constraint**\n\nThe equality constraint $\\sum_{i=1}^{4} x_{i} = 1$ is structurally fundamental to this blending problem. It serves as a normalization condition, rigorously defining the variables $x_i$ as proportions of a single reference unit of the gasoline blend. The objective function minimizes cost *per unit*, and this constraint establishes the very \"unit\" being referred to. Without this constraint, the problem is ill-defined. For instance, if the cost vector $c$ had all positive components, the trivial solution $x=0$ would yield zero cost, but would be physically meaningless and would violate the octane constraint. If a feasible solution $x^*$ existed with cost $c^\\top x^* < 0$, the objective could be made arbitrarily negative by scaling $x^*$ (i.e., $\\alpha x^*$ as $\\alpha \\to \\infty$), rendering the problem unbounded. The constraint $\\sum x_i = 1$ confines the feasible set of solutions to a specific affine hyperplane, which, when intersected with the other bound constraints, creates a compact (closed and bounded) feasible region. By the Extreme Value Theorem, the continuous objective function is guaranteed to attain a minimum on this compact set.\n\n**3. Nullity of the Constraint Matrix A**\n\nThe nullity of a matrix $A$ is the dimension of its null space, $\\text{dim}(\\text{Null}(A))$. By the rank-nullity theorem, for a matrix with $n$ columns, its nullity is given by:\n$$ \\text{nullity}(A) = n - \\text{rank}(A) $$\nIn our case, the matrix $A$ has $n=10$ columns. We need to determine its rank, which is the number of linearly independent rows or columns. We will check the linear independence of the 7 rows of $A$. Let the rows be $R_1, \\dots, R_7$. We seek coefficients $\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_7$ such that their linear combination is the zero vector:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{7} \\alpha_i R_i = 0 $$\nLet's examine the equation column by column. The columns corresponding to the slack and surplus variables are the most revealing.\n- Column 5 (variable $s_1$): This column is $(0,0,0,1,0,0,0)^{\\top}$. The equation for this column is $\\alpha_4 \\cdot 1 = 0$, which implies $\\alpha_4 = 0$.\n- Column 6 (variable $s_2$): This column is $(0,0,0,0,1,0,0)^{\\top}$. The equation is $\\alpha_5 \\cdot 1 = 0$, so $\\alpha_5 = 0$.\n- Column 7 (variable $s_3$): This column is $(0,0,0,0,0,1,0)^{\\top}$. The equation is $\\alpha_6 \\cdot 1 = 0$, so $\\alpha_6 = 0$.\n- Column 8 (variable $s_4$): This column is $(0,0,0,0,0,0,1)^{\\top}$. The equation is $\\alpha_7 \\cdot 1 = 0$, so $\\alpha_7 = 0$.\n\nWith $\\alpha_4, \\alpha_5, \\alpha_6, \\alpha_7$ all zero, the linear combination simplifies to:\n$$ \\alpha_1 R_1 + \\alpha_2 R_2 + \\alpha_3 R_3 = 0 $$\nLet's examine the remaining columns:\n- Column 9 (variable $s_{o1}$): The corresponding entries in $R_1, R_2, R_3$ are $0, -1, 0$. The equation is $\\alpha_1(0) + \\alpha_2(-1) + \\alpha_3(0) = 0$, which implies $\\alpha_2 = 0$.\n- Column 10 (variable $s_{o2}$): The entries are $0, 0, 1$. The equation is $\\alpha_1(0) + \\alpha_2(0) + \\alpha_3(1) = 0$, which implies $\\alpha_3 = 0$.\n\nThis leaves us with $\\alpha_1 R_1 = 0$. Since $R_1 = (1, 1, 1, 1, 0, \\dots, 0)$ is not a zero vector, we must have $\\alpha_1 = 0$.\nThus, the only solution to $\\sum \\alpha_i R_i = 0$ is $\\alpha_1 = \\alpha_2 = \\dots = \\alpha_7 = 0$. This proves that the 7 rows of $A$ are linearly independent.\nThe rank of $A$ is therefore equal to the number of rows, which is $7$.\n\nFinally, we compute the nullity of $A$:\n$$ \\text{nullity}(A) = 10 - \\text{rank}(A) = 10 - 7 = 3 $$\nThe dimension of the solution space of $Az = b$ (without non-negativity constraints) is $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "3113264"}]}
