The concepts of Phase I, slack, surplus, and artificial variables are fundamental to the simplex method for solving LPs that do not have an obvious initial basic feasible solution. The constraints $x_{1} + x_{2} \\leq 3$ and $x_{1} + x_{2} \\geq 5$ are contradictory for non-negative $x_1$ and $x_2$, which implies the feasible region is empty. The Phase I procedure is precisely the standard algorithm to formally prove such infeasibility. The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective. It is a valid problem for which a definitive answer can be derived using the specified method.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\n**1. Conversion to Standard Form**\nFirst, we convert the inequality constraints into equalities.\nFor the constraint $x_{1} + x_{2} \\leq 3$, we introduce a slack variable $s_{1} \\geq 0$:\n$x_{1} + x_{2} + s_{1} = 3$\n\nFor the constraint $x_{1} + x_{2} \\geq 5$, we introduce a surplus variable $s_{2} \\geq 0$:\n$x_{1} + x_{2} - s_{2} = 5$\n\nThe system is now:\n$x_{1} + x_{2} + s_{1} = 3$\n$x_{1} + x_{2} - s_{2} = 5$\nwith all variables $x_{1}, x_{2}, s_{1}, s_{2}$ being non-negative.\n\nTo start the simplex method, we need an initial Basic Feasible Solution (BFS). A BFS is typically found by setting the original decision variables ($x_1, x_2$) to zero. This gives $s_{1} = 3$ and $-s_{2} = 5$, or $s_{2} = -5$. Since variables must be non-negative, this is not a feasible solution.\n\nTo resolve this, we introduce an artificial variable $a_{1} \\geq 0$ into the second equation:\n$x_{1} + x_{2} - s_{2} + a_{1} = 5$\n\nThe complete set of constraints for the Phase I problem is:\n$x_{1} + x_{2} + s_{1} = 3$\n$x_{1} + x_{2} - s_{2} + a_{1} = 5$\n$x_{1}, x_{2}, s_{1}, s_{2}, a_{1} \\geq 0$\n\nAn initial BFS can be found by choosing $\\{s_{1}, a_{1}\\}$ as the basic variables. Setting the non-basic variables $x_{1}=0$, $x_{2}=0$, $s_{2}=0$, we get $s_{1}=3$ and $a_{1}=5$. This is a valid BFS for the modified problem.\n\n**2. Phase I Objective Function**\nThe objective of Phase I is to minimize the sum of all artificial variables. In this case, we have only one, $a_{1}$. Let $w$ be the sum of artificial variables.\nMinimize $w = a_{1}$\n\nThe simplex method is typically formulated as a maximization problem. We can achieve this by maximizing the negative of $w$. Let $w' = -w = -a_{1}$.\nMaximize $w'$\n\nWe must express $w'$ in terms of the non-basic variables ($x_{1}, x_{2}, s_{2}$). From the second constraint:\n$a_{1} = 5 - x_{1} - x_{2} + s_{2}$\nTherefore, the Phase I objective function is:\n$w' = -a_{1} = -(5 - x_{1} - x_{2} + s_{2}) = x_{1} + x_{2} - s_{2} - 5$\nIn standard tableau form, this is written as:\n$w' - x_{1} - x_{2} + s_{2} = -5$\n\n**3. Simplex Tableau and Pivot Operations**\nWe construct the initial tableau for the Phase I problem. The basic variables are $s_{1}$ and $a_{1}$.\n\nInitial Phase I Tableau:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|cccccc|c}\n\\text{Basis} & w' & x_1 & x_2 & s_1 & s_2 & a_1 & \\text{RHS} \\\\\n\\hline\nw' & 1 & -1 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & -5 \\\\\ns_1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 3 \\\\\na_1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & -1 & 1 & 5 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\nTo improve the objective function $w'$, we select a non-basic variable with a negative coefficient in the $w'$-row to enter the basis. The coefficients for $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are both $-1$. We can choose either; let's select $x_{1}$ as the entering variable.\n\nNext, we perform the ratio test to determine the leaving variable. We divide the RHS value by the corresponding positive entry in the pivot column ($x_{1}$ column):\n- Row $s_{1}$: $\\frac{3}{1} = 3$\n- Row $a_{1}$: $\\frac{5}{1} = 5$\n\nThe minimum positive ratio is $3$, which corresponds to the $s_{1}$ row. Thus, $s_{1}$ is the leaving variable. The pivot element is $1$, located at the intersection of the $s_{1}$ row and the $x_{1}$ column.\n\nWe perform a pivot operation to make $x_{1}$ a basic variable and $s_{1}$ non-basic.\nThe pivot row (Row $s_{1}$) already has a $1$ in the pivot position. Let's call this New Row $x_1$.\nNew Row $x_{1}$: $[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3]$\n\nNow, we update the other rows:\nNew $w'$-row = Old $w'$-row + New Row $x_1$\n$[-1, -1, 0, 1, 0, -5] + [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3] = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, -2]$\nThe full row is $[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, -2]$.\n\nNew $a_{1}$-row = Old $a_{1}$-row - New Row $x_1$\n$[1, 1, 0, -1, 1, 5] - [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3] = [0, 0, -1, -1, 1, 2]$\nThe full row is $[0, 0, 0, -1, -1, 1, 2]$.\n\nThe tableau after one pivot operation is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|cccccc|c}\n\\text{Basis} & w' & x_1 & x_2 & s_1 & s_2 & a_1 & \\text{RHS} \\\\\n\\hline\nw' & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & -2 \\\\\nx_1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 3 \\\\\na_1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & -1 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n**4. Final Answer Determination**\nWe examine the $w'$-row in the new tableau. The coefficients for the non-basic variables ($x_{2}, s_{1}, s_{2}$) are $0$, $1$, and $1$. Since all these coefficients are non-negative, the current tableau is optimal for the Phase I problem.\n\nFrom this final tableau, we read the optimal value of $w'$ from the RHS, which is $w'_{\\text{max}} = -2$.\nThe original Phase I objective was to minimize $w = a_{1}$. Since $w' = -w$, the minimum value of $w$ is given by:\n$w_{\\text{min}} = -w'_{\\text{max}} = -(-2) = 2$.\n\nAlternatively, we can read the value of the artificial variable $a_{1}$ directly from the tableau. Since $a_{1}$ is a basic variable, its value is given in the RHS column of its row: $a_{1} = 2$. The sum of artificial variables is just $w = a_1 = 2$.\n\nAccording to the rules of the Phase I method, if the optimal value of the sum of artificial variables is positive ($w_{\\text{min}} > 0$), then the original LP problem has no feasible solution. In this case, $w_{\\text{min}} = 2$, confirming that the original problem is infeasible.\n\nThe question asks for the optimal value of the Phase I objective, which is the minimum of the sum of artificial variables. This value is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3190356"}, {"introduction": "The pivot operation is the engine of the simplex method, moving from one BFS to an adjacent one while improving the objective function.

Substituting this into the first equation:\n$x_3 + 2(2x_3 - 2) = 4$\n$x_3 + 4x_3 - 4 = 4$\n$5x_3 = 8 \\implies x_3 = \\frac{8}{5}$\nThen, $x_4 = 2(\\frac{8}{5}) - 2 = \\frac{16}{5} - \\frac{10}{5} = \\frac{6}{5}$.\nThis point $(\\frac{8}{5}, \\frac{6}{5})$ satisfies $x_3 \\ge 0$ and $x_4 \\ge 0$, so it is a valid vertex. This corresponds to a fourth optimal BFS, $P_4$.\nFor $P_4$: $x_3 = \\frac{8}{5}, x_4 = \\frac{6}{5}, x_5 = 0$. The values of the original basic variables are:\n$x_1 = 4 - (\\frac{8}{5}) - 2(\\frac{6}{5}) = \\frac{20-8-12}{5} = 0$\n$x_2 = 2 - 2(\\frac{8}{5}) + \\frac{6}{5} = \\frac{10-16+6}{5} = 0$\nSo, $P_4 = (0, 0, \\frac{8}{5}, \\frac{6}{5}, 0)$. In this BFS, the basic variables are $x_3$ and $x_4$.\n\nThe four distinct optimal basic feasible solutions (extreme points) are:\n1. $P_1: (4, 2, 0, 0, 0)$\n2. $P_2: (3, 0, 1, 0, 0)$\n3. $P_3: (0, 4, 0, 2, 0)$\n4. $P_4: (0, 0, \\frac{8}{5}, \\frac{6}{5}, 0)$\n\nPivoting from $P_2$, $P_3$, or $P_4$ on non-basic variables with zero reduced cost will lead back to one of these four solutions. For example, from $P_2$ (basis $\\{x_1, x_3\\}$), one can pivot to $P_1$ (by entering $x_2$) or to $P_4$ (by entering $x_4$). From $P_3$ (basis $\\{x_2, x_4\\}$), one can pivot to $P_1$ (by entering $x_1$) or to $P_4$ (by entering $x_3$). From $P_4$ (basis $\\{x_3, x_4\\}$), one can pivot to $P_2$ (by entering $x_1$) or to $P_3$ (by entering $x_2$).\nNo further distinct extreme points can be found.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of $4$ distinct extreme points on the optimal face.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "3190401"}]}
