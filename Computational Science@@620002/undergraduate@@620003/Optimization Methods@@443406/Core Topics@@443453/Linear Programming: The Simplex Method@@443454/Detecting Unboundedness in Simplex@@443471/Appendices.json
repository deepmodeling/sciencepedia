The question is scientifically grounded in the theory of linear programming, is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information. It is a standard exercise in optimization methods. Thus, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 2: Solution**\n\nFirst, we convert the LP problem into standard form by introducing non-negative slack variables, $s_1$ and $s_2$.\n\nThe constraints become:\n$$-2x_1 + x_2 + s_1 = 3$$\n$$-x_1 + x_3 + s_2 = 2$$\nwith $x_1, x_2, x_3, s_1, s_2 \\ge 0$.\n\nThe objective function is rewritten for the simplex tableau as:\n$$z - 7x_1 - 2x_2 - x_3 = 0$$\n\nThe initial basic feasible solution (BFS) is found by setting the original variables (the nonbasic variables) to zero: $x_1=0$, $x_2=0$, $x_3=0$. This gives the basic variables as $s_1=3$ and $s_2=2$. The initial objective value is $z=0$.\n\nWe can now construct the initial simplex tableau. The basic variables are $s_1$ and $s_2$.\n\nThe initial tableau is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|ccccc|c}\n\\text{Basis} & z & x_1 & x_2 & x_3 & s_1 & s_2 & \\text{RHS} \\\\\n\\hline\nz & 1 & -7 & -2 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\hline\ns_1 & 0 & -2 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 3 \\\\\ns_2 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe simplex method for maximization proceeds by selecting a nonbasic variable with a negative coefficient in the objective row (the $z$-row) to enter the basis. These coefficients are the reduced costs, $\\bar{c}_j$. We have $\\bar{c}_1 = -7$, $\\bar{c}_2 = -2$, and $\\bar{c}_3 = -1$. Any of these variables could be chosen to enter the basis to increase the objective function. A common heuristic is to choose the variable with the most negative reduced cost. Following this rule, we select $x_1$ as the entering variable. The column associated with $x_1$ is the pivot column.\n\nThe problem states that we must stop at the first tableau that guarantees unboundedness. We must now examine the pivot column for the unboundedness condition. The condition for an unbounded solution in the simplex method is the existence of an entering variable (a column with a negative reduced cost in the $z$-row) for which all constraint-row coefficients in its column are non-positive (i.e., less than or equal to zero).\n\nLet's inspect the pivot column for $x_1$:\n- The coefficient in the $s_1$ row is $a_{11} = -2$.\n- The coefficient in the $s_2$ row is $a_{21} = -1$.\n\nBoth of these coefficients, $-2$ and $-1$, are non-positive. This satisfies the condition for unboundedness. Therefore, the initial tableau itself certifies that the LP problem has an unbounded objective function.\n\nTo understand why this is the case, consider the equations derived from the tableau, expressing the basic variables and the objective function in terms of the nonbasic variables ($x_1, x_2, x_3$):\n$$z = 7x_1 + 2x_2 + x_3$$\n$$s_1 = 3 + 2x_1 - x_2$$\n$$s_2 = 2 + x_1 - x_3$$\n\nTo find the direction of unboundedness, we increase the entering variable, $x_1$, while keeping the other nonbasic variables fixed at zero ($x_2=0, x_3=0$). The system becomes:\n$$z = 7x_1$$\n$$s_1 = 3 + 2x_1$$\n$$s_2 = 2 + x_1$$\n\nAs we increase $x_1$ from $0$, the objective function $z$ increases. Simultaneously, the basic variables $s_1$ and $s_2$ also increase, since their dependence on $x_1$ is through positive coefficients ($+2$ and $+1$). This means that for any arbitrarily large positive value of $x_1$, the solution vector $(x_1, x_2, x_3, s_1, s_2) = (x_1, 0, 0, 3+2x_1, 2+x_1)$ remains feasible (all components are non-negative). Since $x_1$ can be increased without bound, the objective function $z = 7x_1$ can also be increased without bound.\n\nThe problem asks for the rate of increase of the objective function per unit increase along the unbounded direction. This direction corresponds to increasing $x_1$ while holding $x_2$ and $x_3$ at zero. The relationship is $z=7x_1$. The rate of increase of $z$ with respect to a unit increase in $x_1$ is given by the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x_1}$, which is $7$. This is precisely the negative of the reduced cost of the entering variable $x_1$ in the objective row of the tableau (i.e., $-(-7) = 7$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7}$$", "id": "3118318"}, {"introduction": "In practical applications, an unbounded result often points to a flaw or omission in the problem's formulation. This exercise places you in the role of an analyst tasked with diagnosing such a model.

The basic variables are $s_1$ and $s_2$.\n5.  **Simplex Method Observation 1:** The first entering variable is $x_1$. The column for $x_1$ in the initial simplex tableau is nonpositive, indicating unboundedness.\n6.  **Missing Constraint:** A single constraint of the form $x_k \\leq \\beta$ for some $k \\in \\{1, 2\\}$ and $\\beta > 0$ was omitted.\n7.  **Simplex Method Observation 2:** After adding the missing constraint, the simplex method is restarted from the same initial BFS. The first pivot operation makes the new constraint binding.\n8.  **Resulting State:** At the new BFS after the first pivot, the slack variable $s_1$ has a value of $13$.\n\n**Validation Verdict:**\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is set in the context of linear programming and the simplex method, both of which are fundamental and well-established topics in optimization theory. All concepts are standard and mathematically rigorous. The problem is scientifically grounded.\n- **Well-Posed and Consistent:** The problem provides a clear objective and a set of conditions that appear sufficient to determine a unique value for the unknown parameter $\\beta$. There are no apparent contradictions. The information about the simplex method's behavior provides a logical path to the solution. The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective:** The problem statement is written in precise, mathematical language, free from subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Step 2: Solution**\n\nThe objective function to maximize is $z = 4x_1 + x_2$. At the initial BFS where $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = 0$, both are non-basic variables. Their coefficients in the objective function, known as reduced costs (in a maximization context), are $4$ and $1$. Since $4 > 1$, the simplex method with the largest coefficient rule selects $x_1$ as the entering variable, consistent with the problem statement.\n\nThe initial simplex tableau corresponds to the system:\n$$\n-x_1 + x_2 + s_1 = 1 \\\\\n-3x_1 + x_2 + s_2 = 3\n$$\nThe column associated with the entering variable $x_1$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}$. Since all entries in this column are nonpositive, increasing $x_1$ from $0$ will never cause the current basic variables, $s_1$ and $s_2$, to decrease to $0$. Specifically, if we increase $x_1$ while keeping the other non-basic variable $x_2$ at $0$, the basic variables become $s_1 = 1 + x_1$ and $s_2 = 3 + 3x_1$. As $x_1$ increases, so do $s_1$ and $s_2$, meaning they remain non-negative. This confirms the original problem is unbounded.\n\nNext, a single upper bound constraint, $x_k \\leq \\beta$ with $\\beta > 0$, is added. We must determine if $k=1$ or $k=2$.\n\n**Case 1: The missing constraint is $x_2 \\leq \\beta$**\nIf we add the constraint $x_2 \\leq \\beta$, the simplex method still begins by choosing $x_1$ as the entering variable. This means we increase $x_1$ while holding the other non-basic variable, $x_2$, at $0$. The new constraint $x_2 \\leq \\beta$ evaluates to $0 \\leq \\beta$, which is true since $\\beta > 0$ and does not restrict the increase of $x_1$. The problem would remain unbounded in the direction of $x_1$. This contradicts the problem statement that the first pivot makes the new bound binding. Therefore, the missing constraint cannot be on $x_2$.\n\n**Case 2: The missing constraint is $x_1 \\leq \\beta$**\nWe add the constraint $x_1 \\leq \\beta$. In standard form, this is $x_1 + s_3 = \\beta$, where $s_3$ is a new slack variable. The new initial system of constraints is:\n$$\n-x_1 + x_2 + s_1 = 1 \\\\\n-3x_1 + x_2 + s_2 = 3 \\\\\nx_1 + s_3 = \\beta\n$$\nThe initial BFS is $(x_1, x_2) = (0, 0)$, so the initial basic variables are $(s_1, s_2, s_3)$ with values $(1, 3, \\beta)$.\n\nThe simplex method again selects $x_1$ to enter the basis. To find the leaving variable, we perform the minimum ratio test. The direction of change is increasing $x_1$ while keeping $x_2=0$.\n1.  For the first constraint, $s_1 = 1 + x_1$. $s_1$ increases with $x_1$, so this constraint is not limiting.\n2.  For the second constraint, $s_2 = 3 + 3x_1$. $s_2$ increases with $x_1$, so this constraint is also not limiting.\n3.  For the third constraint, $s_3 = \\beta - x_1$. For $s_3$ to remain non-negative, we must have $x_1 \\leq \\beta$.\n\nThe increase of $x_1$ is limited only by the new constraint. The maximum value $x_1$ can take is $\\beta$. At this point, $s_3 = 0$, so $s_3$ leaves the basis. This is consistent with the problem statement that \"the newly added bound becomes binding\".\n\nThe pivot operation moves the solution from the initial BFS $(x_1, x_2) = (0, 0)$ to a new BFS. Since $x_1$ enters the basis and its value is limited by the new constraint, the new value of $x_1$ is $\\beta$. The other non-basic variable from the start, $x_2$, remains at $0$.\nSo, the new BFS is at the point $(x_1, x_2) = (\\beta, 0)$.\n\nThe problem states that at this new BFS, the slack variable $s_1$ has the value $13$. The slack variable $s_1$ is defined by the first constraint:\n$$\n-x_1 + x_2 + s_1 = 1\n$$\nWe can solve for $s_1$ in terms of the decision variables:\n$$\ns_1 = 1 + x_1 - x_2\n$$\nNow, we substitute the coordinates of the new BFS, $(x_1, x_2) = (\\beta, 0)$, into this equation:\n$$\ns_1 = 1 + \\beta - 0 = 1 + \\beta\n$$\nWe are given that $s_1 = 13$ at this solution. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n$$\n13 = 1 + \\beta\n$$\nSolving for $\\beta$ gives:\n$$\n\\beta = 13 - 1 = 12\n$$\nThe unique value of $\\beta$ consistent with the observations is $12$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12}$$", "id": "3118332"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond specific numerical examples, a deeper understanding of linear programming involves analyzing how a model's behavior changes with its parameters.

It is a well-defined exercise in applying the principles of the simplex method.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem is a maximization linear programming problem. The simplex method for maximization proceeds by selecting a nonbasic variable with a positive coefficient (reduced cost) in the objective function row to enter the basis.\n\nThe objective function is given by:\n$$\nz = z_0 + (1 - \\alpha)x_2 + 1 \\cdot x_3\n$$\nThe reduced cost for the nonbasic variable $x_2$ is $1 - \\alpha$.\nThe reduced cost for the nonbasic variable $x_3$ is $1$.\n\nThe problem states that we must work in the parameter regime $\\alpha \\ge 1$.\nIn this regime, the reduced cost for $x_2$, which is $1 - \\alpha$, satisfies $1 - \\alpha \\le 0$. Since this coefficient is non-positive, $x_2$ cannot be chosen as the entering variable to increase the objective function $z$.\nThe reduced cost for $x_3$ is $1$, which is strictly greater than $0$. Therefore, $x_3$ is the unique choice for the entering variable.\n\nOnce the entering variable is identified as $x_3$, we must check if increasing it will cause any of the basic variables to become negative. The dictionary contains one basic variable, $x_1$, and its corresponding constraint equation is:\n$$\nx_1 = 4 - (2 + \\alpha)x_2 - (\\beta - 2\\alpha + 3)x_3\n$$\nTo analyze the effect of increasing $x_3$, we keep the other nonbasic variable, $x_2$, at $0$. The equation for $x_1$ simplifies to:\n$$\nx_1 = 4 - (\\beta - 2\\alpha + 3)x_3\n$$\nThe problem is unbounded if the entering variable $x_3$ can be increased indefinitely without violating the non-negativity constraint $x_1 \\ge 0$. As $x_3$ increases from $0$, the objective function $z$ increases. The variable $x_1$ must remain non-negative.\n\nThe condition for immediate detection of unboundedness in a maximization problem is that the entering variable (here, $x_3$) has a non-positive coefficient in all constraint rows. In this problem, we have only one constraint row for the basic variable $x_1$. The standard form for a dictionary row is $x_i = b_i - \\sum_j a_{ij} x_j$. The coefficient of $x_3$ in the equation for $x_1$ is $a_{13} = (\\beta - 2\\alpha + 3)$. The unboundedness condition is that $a_{13} \\le 0$.\n\nSo, the problem is unbounded if:\n$$\n\\beta - 2\\alpha + 3 \\le 0\n$$\n\nConversely, a bounded pivot exists if this condition is not met. A bounded pivot requires performing the ratio test to find a leaving variable. The ratio test is possible only if the coefficient of the entering variable is positive in at least one constraint row. In this case, it means the coefficient $a_{13}$ must be positive.\n\nA bounded pivot exists if:\n$$\n\\beta - 2\\alpha + 3 > 0\n$$\nIn this case, $x_1$ would be the leaving variable, and the maximum value $x_3$ can take before $x_1$ becomes $0$ is given by the ratio test: $x_3 = \\frac{4}{\\beta - 2\\alpha + 3}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the boundary in the $(\\alpha, \\beta)$-plane that separates these two regions.
