I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nFirst, we convert the LP problem into standard form. The standard form requires all constraints to be equalities with non-negative right-hand sides, and all variables to be non-negative.\n\nThe first constraint is an equality:\n$$ x_1 + x_2 = 4 $$\nThe second constraint is a 'greater than or equal to' inequality. We introduce a surplus variable $s_2 \\ge 0$:\n$$ x_1 - x_2 - s_2 = 1 $$\nThe non-negativity constraints are already given: $x_1 \\ge 0, x_2 \\ge 0$.\n\nThe system of constraints is:\n$$ x_1 + x_2 \\quad\\quad = 4 $$\n$$ x_1 - x_2 - s_2 = 1 $$\n$$ x_1, x_2, s_2 \\ge 0 $$\n\nTo begin the Simplex method, we need an initial Basic Feasible Solution (BFS), which corresponds to an identity submatrix within the constraint coefficient matrix. The matrix for variables $(x_1, x_2, s_2)$ is $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This matrix does not contain a $2 \\times 2$ identity submatrix. Therefore, we must introduce artificial variables, one for each constraint, to form an initial basis. Let's call them $a_1$ and $a_2$.\n\nThe system becomes:\n$$ x_1 + x_2 + a_1 = 4 $$\n$$ x_1 - x_2 - s_2 + a_2 = 1 $$\n$$ x_1, x_2, s_2, a_1, a_2 \\ge 0 $$\n\nThe initial basis is $\\{a_1, a_2\\}$. Setting the non-basic variables $x_1, x_2, s_2$ to $0$, we get the initial BFS for the augmented problem: $a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1$.\n\nNow we analyze the two methods.\n\n**Two-Phase Simplex Method (Phase I)**\n\nIn Phase I, we aim to minimize the sum of the artificial variables, $w = a_1 + a_2$. If the minimum value of $w$ is $0$, then we have found a BFS for the original problem. If the minimum value is positive, the original problem is infeasible.\n\nWe minimize $w = a_1 + a_2$, which is equivalent to maximizing $-w = -a_1 - a_2$.\nWe must express the objective function in terms of the non-basic variables $(x_1, x_2, s_2)$.\nFrom the constraints:\n$a_1 = 4 - x_1 - x_2$\n$a_2 = 1 - x_1 + x_2 + s_2$\n\nSubstituting these into the Phase I objective function gives:\n$w = (4 - x_1 - x_2) + (1 - x_1 + x_2 + s_2) = 5 - 2x_1 + s_2$\nTo maximize $-w$, the objective is:\n$$ \\text{Maximize } z_I = -w = 2x_1 - s_2 - 5 $$\nThe initial tableau represents this objective as $z_I - 2x_1 + s_2 = -5$.\nThe reduced costs for the non-basic variables are the coefficients in the expression for $z_I$: $r_{x_1}=2$, $r_{x_2}=0$, $r_{s_2}=-1$.\n\nTo select the entering variable, we choose the one with the largest positive reduced cost. Here, $r_{x_1} = 2$ is the largest, so $x_1$ enters the basis.\n\nTo select the leaving variable, we perform the minimum ratio test using the column for $x_1$ and the RHS:\n- For the first row (basic variable $a_1$): ratio = $4/1 = 4$.\n- For the second row (basic variable $a_2$): ratio = $1/1 = 1$.\n\nThe minimum ratio is $1$, which corresponds to the second row. Therefore, the leaving variable is $a_2$. The first pivot operation involves $x_1$ entering and $a_2$ leaving.\n\n**Big-$M$ Method**\n\nIn the Big-$M$ method, we modify the original objective function by subtracting a large penalty $M$ for each artificial variable.\nThe new objective is to maximize:\n$$ z' = 3x_1 + 2x_2 - Ma_1 - Ma_2 $$\nWe express $z'$ in terms of the non-basic variables:\n$z' = 3x_1 + 2x_2 - M(4 - x_1 - x_2) - M(1 - x_1 + x_2 + s_2)$\n$z' = 3x_1 + 2x_2 - 4M + Mx_1 + Mx_2 - M + Mx_1 - Mx_2 - Ms_2$\n$z' = (3 + 2M)x_1 + 2x_2 - Ms_2 - 5M$\n\nThe reduced costs for the non-basic variables are the coefficients in this expression:\n$r_{x_1} = 3 + 2M$\n$r_{x_2} = 2$\n$r_{s_2} = -M$\n\nFor a maximization problem, we select the entering variable with the largest positive reduced cost. Since $M$ is a large positive number, $r_{x_1} = 3 + 2M$ is positive and is the largest of the three reduced costs. Thus, $x_1$ is selected to enter the basis. The minimum ratio test is identical to the one in Phase I, as it only depends on the constraint rows, which are the same. Therefore, $a_2$ leaves the basis.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In the Two-Phase Simplex method (Phase I), the standard-form system uses one surplus and two artificial variables, and the initial BFS has $a_1 = 4$ and $a_2 = 1$; the first pivot selects $x_1$ to enter and $a_2$ to leave.**\n- The conversion to standard form requires one surplus variable ($s_2$) and two artificial variables ($a_1, a_2$). This is correct.\n- The initial BFS for the artificial basis $\\{a_1, a_2\\}$ is found by setting non-basics $x_1=x_2=s_2=0$, which gives $a_1 = 4$ and $a_2 = 1$. This is correct.\n- Our analysis of Phase I showed that $x_1$ enters (largest positive reduced cost) and $a_2$ leaves (minimum ratio test). This is correct.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. In the Big-$M$ method with $M > 0$, the initial objective row reduced costs are $r_{x_1} = 3 + 2 M$, $r_{x_2} = 2$, and $r_{s_2} = - M$, so $x_1$ is selected to enter on the first pivot.**\n- Our derivation for the Big-$M$ method yielded the objective $z' = (3 + 2M)x_1 + 2x_2 - Ms_2 - 5M$. The reduced costs for the non-basic variables are indeed $r_{x_1} = 3 + 2M$, $r_{x_2} = 2$, and $r_{s_2} = -M$.\n- For $M > 0$, the largest positive reduced cost is $3+2M$. Thus, $x_1$ is selected to enter the basis.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. The constraint rows of the initial tableaux are identical under Two-Phase and Big-$M$; only the objective row differs.**\n- Both methods begin by creating the same standard form system with artificial variables:\n  $x_1 + x_2 + a_1 = 4$\n  $x_1 - x_2 - s_2 + a_2 = 1$\n- Both methods use the same initial basis $\\{a_1, a_2\\}$. The constraint rows of the Simplex tableau represent this system of equations. Since the system and the initial basis are identical, the constraint rows in the initial tableau must be identical for both methods.\n- The objective functions, however, are different: $z_I = 2x_1 - s_2 - 5$ for Phase I and $z' \\approx (2M)x_1 - Ms_2$ for Big-$M$, leading to different objective rows in the tableau.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. In the Big-$M$ method with finite $M > 0$, the surplus variable $s_2$ may be selected to enter first because its reduced cost equals $+M$.**\n- Our calculation showed that the reduced cost of the surplus variable $s_2$ is $r_{s_2} = -M$. Since $M > 0$, this reduced cost is negative.\n- In a maximization problem, a variable is selected to enter only if its reduced cost is positive. The statement claims the reduced cost is $+M$, which is incorrect, and implies it could be selected to enter, which is also incorrect as it would decrease the objective value.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. No artificial variables are needed here because, after adding one slack or surplus variable, the constraint coefficient matrix already contains an identity submatrix.**\n- After adding the surplus variable $s_2$, the constraint coefficient matrix is $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- An initial basis requires a $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix as a submatrix of $A$. The columns of $A$ are $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$, and $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. No combination of two of these columns forms the identity matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- Therefore, artificial variables are necessary to start the Simplex method.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "3182206"}, {"introduction": "Each step of the Simplex method involves a pivot that updates the entire tableau.

The question is precise and seeks a deterministic outcome based on the algorithm's rules.\n    *   **Objectivity:** The problem statement is objective and technical, free of ambiguity or subjective language.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\nThe problem statement is valid. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n**Step 2: Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe solution will be derived by following the steps of the simplex algorithm from the given state.\n\n**1. Analyze the Initial State**\nThe current simplex tableau is in canonical form for the basis $B = \\{s_1, s_2, s_3\\}$. The non-basic variables are $N = \\{x_1, x_2\\}$. Setting the non-basic variables to zero ($x_1=0, x_2=0$), we find the current basic feasible solution (BFS):\n$s_1 = 0$\n$s_2 = 0$\n$s_3 = 6$\n\nThe solution vector is $(x_1, x_2, s_1, s_2, s_3) = (0, 0, 0, 0, 6)$.\nA BFS is defined as **degenerate** if at least one of its basic variables is equal to $0$. Here, two basic variables, $s_1$ and $s_2$, are $0$. Therefore, the current BFS is degenerate.\nThe current objective function value is located at the bottom-right of the tableau, which is $Z = 0$.\n\n**2. Perform the Simplex Pivot Step**\n\n*   **Choice of Entering Variable:** The problem states that $x_1$ is chosen as the entering variable. This is a valid choice for a maximization problem because its reduced cost is positive: $r_1 = 1 > 0$. A positive reduced cost $r_j = c_j - z_j$ indicates that increasing the non-basic variable $x_j$ will increase the objective function value, assuming a positive step length.\n\n*   **Choice of Leaving Variable (Minimum Ratio Test):** The leaving variable is determined by the minimum ratio test, which calculates the maximum allowable increase in the entering variable ($x_1$) before a basic variable becomes negative. The step length $\\theta$ is given by:\n    $$ \\theta = \\min_{i} \\left\\{ \\frac{\\text{RHS}_i}{a_{ik}} \\;\\middle|\\; a_{ik} > 0 \\right\\} $$\n    where $k=1$ is the index of the entering variable $x_1$, and $a_{ik}$ are the coefficients in the $x_1$ column.\n\n    *   For the first basic variable, $s_1$ (row 1): $a_{11} = 1 > 0$. The ratio is $\\frac{\\text{RHS}_1}{a_{11}} = \\frac{0}{1} = 0$.\n    *   For the second basic variable, $s_2$ (row 2): $a_{21} = 2 > 0$. The ratio is $\\frac{\\text{RHS}_2}{a_{21}} = \\frac{0}{2} = 0$.\n    *   For the third basic variable, $s_3$ (row 3): $a_{31} = 1 > 0$. The ratio is $\\frac{\\text{RHS}_3}{a_{31}} = \\frac{6}{1} = 6$.\n\n    The minimum of these ratios is $\\min(0, 0, 6) = 0$. This confirms the problem statement that there is a tie. The tie is between the rows corresponding to the basic variables $s_1$ and $s_2$.\n\n*   **Consequences of the Pivot:**\n    *   **Step Length:** The step length for this pivot is $\\theta = 0$.\n    *   **Change in Objective Function:** The change in the objective function value, $\\Delta Z$, is calculated as the product of the step length and the reduced cost of the entering variable: $\\Delta Z = \\theta \\times r_1 = 0 \\times 1 = 0$. This means there is **no immediate improvement** in the objective function, regardless of whether $s_1$ or $s_2$ is chosen to leave.\n    *   **Pivot Type:** A pivot operation where the step length $\\theta = 0$ is, by definition, a **degenerate pivot**.\n    *   **Change in Solution Point:** The new values of the variables are calculated as $x_{new} = x_{old} + \\theta d$, where $d$ is the feasible direction. Since $\\theta = 0$, the new solution point will be identical to the old one: $(x_1, x_2, s_1, s_2, s_3) = (0, 0, 0, 0, 6)$. While the point in $\\mathbb{R}^5$ remains the same, the basis (the set of basic variables) will change. This is the defining characteristic of a degenerate pivot: a change in the algebraic representation (the basis) without a change in the geometric point (the vertex of the feasible region).\n    *   **Possibility of Cycling:** When one or more degenerate pivots occur, the simplex method changes bases without moving to a new vertex and without improving the objective function. It is possible for the algorithm to sequence through a series of bases and return to a previously visited one, creating an infinite loop. This phenomenon is known as **cycling**. To prevent cycling, specific tie-breaking rules, such as Bland's rule or the lexicographical rule, must be employed.\n\n**Step 3: Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. Choosing $s_1$ to leave yields a nondegenerate pivot with a strict objective improvement, while choosing $s_2$ to leave yields a degenerate pivot with no objective change.**\n    As determined above, the minimum ratio is $\\theta=0$ for both potential leaving variables $s_1$ and $s_2$. A pivot with $\\theta=0$ is by definition degenerate and yields no objective improvement. Therefore, choosing $s_1$ to leave also results in a degenerate pivot with no objective change. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **B. Choosing either $s_1$ or $s_2$ to leave yields a degenerate pivot with no immediate objective improvement; the basis changes but the basic feasible solution remains the same point; cycling is possible unless an anti-cycling rule is applied.**\n    This statement aligns perfectly with our derivation.\n    - Choosing either $s_1$ or $s_2$ involves a step length $\\theta = 0$, which defines a degenerate pivot.\n    - A degenerate pivot results in $\\Delta Z = 0$, so there is no objective improvement.\n    - A degenerate pivot changes the basis (e.g., from $\\{s_1, s_2, s_3\\}$ to $\\{x_1, s_2, s_3\\}$) but the solution point remains unchanged.\n    - Degenerate pivots are the necessary condition for cycling to occur.\n    This statement is **Correct**.\n\n*   **C. Choosing either $s_1$ or $s_2$ to leave yields a nondegenerate pivot with the same positive step length; the objective improves by the same positive amount in both cases.**\n    The pivot is degenerate, not nondegenerate. The step length is $\\theta = 0$, not positive. The objective function does not improve. This statement is entirely factually wrong. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. Choosing $s_3$ to leave is also valid under the tie; this choice causes degeneracy and decreases the objective value immediately after pivoting.**\n    The minimum ratio test requires selecting a variable corresponding to the *minimum* ratio. The minimum ratio is $0$, associated with $s_1$ and $s_2$. The ratio for $s_3$ is $6$. Therefore, choosing $s_3$ as the leaving variable is a violation of the simplex algorithm's rules. Such a choice would lead to an infeasible solution in the next tableau (one or more RHS values would become negative). Additionally, a valid simplex pivot for a maximization problem can never decrease the objective value. This statement is **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "3182176"}]}
