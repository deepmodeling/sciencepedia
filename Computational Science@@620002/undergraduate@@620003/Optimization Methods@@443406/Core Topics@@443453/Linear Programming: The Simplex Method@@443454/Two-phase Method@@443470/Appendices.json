This first exercise provides a direct application of this idea, where we begin with a set of 'greater-than-or-equal-to' constraints and must find an initial valid solution. By minimizing the sum of artificial variables, we systematically pivot towards a basic feasible solution for the original problem, building your foundational skills in executing the Phase I procedure [@problem_id:2222374].", "problem": "A nutritionist is creating a diet plan using two food supplements, Supplement A and Supplement B. Let $x_1$ represent the number of servings of Supplement A and $x_2$ represent the number of servings of Supplement B. Both $x_1$ and $x_2$ must be non-negative.\n\nThe nutritional information and daily requirements are as follows:\n- Each serving of Supplement A provides 1 unit of Vitamin P and 2 units of Vitamin Q.\n- Each serving of Supplement B provides 1 unit of Vitamin P, but its metabolic processing consumes 1 unit of Vitamin Q.\n- The diet must provide a total of at least 5 units of Vitamin P and at least 1 unit of Vitamin Q.\n\nThis leads to a system of linear inequalities that define the feasible region of diet plans $(x_1, x_2)$. To find an initial valid plan, we can apply the Phase I procedure of the two-phase simplex method.\n\nUsing the Phase I procedure, determine the first basic feasible solution $(x_1, x_2)$ for the original problem. Your answer should be the values for $x_1$ and $x_2$.", "solution": "Let $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ denote the nonnegative servings of Supplements A and B, respectively. The requirements translate to the following system of inequalities:\n$$\nx_{1}+x_{2}\\geq 5 \\\\\n2x_{1}-x_{2}\\geq 1\n$$\nwith $x_1, x_2 \\ge 0$.\n\n**Step 1: Set up the Phase I Problem**\nTo begin, we convert the inequalities into equalities by introducing non-negative surplus variables ($s_1, s_2$) and non-negative artificial variables ($a_1, a_2$):\n$$\nx_{1}+x_{2}-s_{1}+a_{1}=5 \\\\\n2x_{1}-x_{2}-s_{2}+a_{2}=1\n$$\nThe goal of Phase I is to minimize the sum of the artificial variables, $w = a_1 + a_2$. If the minimum value of $w$ is zero, we have found a feasible solution to the original problem. To use the simplex method, we express $w$ in terms of the non-basic variables. Initially, the basic variables are $a_1=5$ and $a_2=1$.\nFrom the constraints, we have:\n$a_1 = 5 - x_1 - x_2 + s_1$\n$a_2 = 1 - 2x_1 + x_2 + s_2$\nSubstituting these into the objective function:\n$w = a_1 + a_2 = (5 - x_1 - x_2 + s_1) + (1 - 2x_1 + x_2 + s_2) = 6 - 3x_1 + s_1 + s_2$\nMinimizing $w$ is equivalent to maximizing $-w$. Let $Z_I = -w = 3x_1 - s_1 - s_2 - 6$. The objective row in the simplex tableau is $Z_I - 3x_1 + s_1 + s_2 = -6$.\n\n**Step 2: Simplex Method Execution**\n\nInitial Tableau (Maximizing $Z_I$):\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|cccccc|c}\n\\text{Basis}  Z_I  x_1  x_2  s_1  s_2  a_1  a_2  \\text{RHS} \\\\ \\hline\na_1  0  1  1  -1  0  1  0  5 \\\\\na_2  0  2  -1  0  -1  0  1  1 \\\\ \\hline\nZ_I  1  -3  0  1  1  0  0  -6\n\\end{array}\n$$\n**Pivot 1**: The most negative coefficient in the $Z_I$ row is $-3$ (for $x_1$), so $x_1$ enters the basis. We perform the minimum ratio test on rows with positive coefficients in the $x_1$ column:\n- Row 1: $5/1 = 5$\n- Row 2: $1/2 = 0.5$\nThe minimum ratio is $0.5$ from Row 2, so $a_2$ leaves the basis. The pivot element is 2. After performing row operations, the tableau becomes:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|cccccc|c}\n\\text{Basis}  Z_I  x_1  x_2  s_1  s_2  a_1  a_2  \\text{RHS} \\\\ \\hline\na_1  0  0  3/2  -1  1/2  1  -1/2  9/2 \\\\\nx_1  0  1  -1/2  0  -1/2  0  1/2  1/2 \\\\ \\hline\nZ_I  1  0  -3/2  1  -1/2  0  3/2  -9/2\n\\end{array}\n$$\n**Pivot 2**: The most negative coefficient is now $-3/2$ (for $x_2$), so $x_2$ enters the basis. The only positive coefficient in the $x_2$ column is in Row 1.\n- Row 1: $(9/2) / (3/2) = 3$\nThus, $a_1$ leaves the basis. The pivot element is $3/2$. After row operations, we get the final tableau for Phase I:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|cccccc|c}\n\\text{Basis}  Z_I  x_1  x_2  s_1  s_2  a_1  a_2  \\text{RHS} \\\\ \\hline\nx_2  0  0  1  -2/3  1/3  2/3  -1/3  3 \\\\\nx_1  0  1  0  -1/3  -1/3  1/3  1/3  2 \\\\ \\hline\nZ_I  1  0  0  0  0  1  1  0\n\\end{array}\n$$\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\nThe objective row has no negative coefficients, so the optimization is complete. The maximum value of $Z_I$ is $0$, which means the minimum value of $w$ is $0$. This indicates that the original problem is feasible. The artificial variables $a_1$ and $a_2$ have been driven out of the basis.\n\nThe basic feasible solution for the original problem is read from the final tableau:\n$x_1 = 2$\n$x_2 = 3$\nThis is the first basic feasible solution found by the procedure.

This process involves transforming the problem into equality-standard form, introducing necessary variables, and applying the simplex algorithm.\n\nThe initial LP is defined by the objective to maximize $Z = x_{1} + 3x_{2}$, subject to the constraints:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx_{1} + 2x_{2} \\leq 6 \\\\\n-x_{1} + x_{2} \\geq -2 \\\\\nx_{1} - x_{2} = 2\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwith non-negativity conditions $x_{1} \\ge 0$ and $x_{2} \\ge 0$.\n\n**Step 1: Conversion to Equality-Standard Form**\n\nThe goal is to convert the system of inequalities and equalities into a system of pure equalities of the form $A'x' = b'$, where all variables in the vector $x'$ are non-negative ($x' \\ge 0$) and the right-hand side vector $b'$ is also non-negative ($b' \\ge 0$).\n\n1.  **Constraint 1: $x_{1} + 2x_{2} \\leq 6$**\n    This is a \"less than or equal to\" inequality. To convert it into an equality, we introduce a non-negative **slack variable**, denoted by $s_{1} \\ge 0$. The slack variable represents the unused amount of the resource.\n    $$x_{1} + 2x_{2} + s_{1} = 6$$\n    The variable $s_{1}$ provides a column $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ for the initial basis.\n\n2.  **Constraint 2: $-x_{1} + x_{2} \\geq -2$**\n    First, we must ensure the right-hand side (RHS) is non-negative, as required for the standard form. We multiply the entire inequality by $-1$, which reverses the inequality sign:\n    $$(-1)(-x_{1} + x_{2}) \\leq (-1)(-2) \\implies x_{1} - x_{2} \\leq 2$$\n    This is now a \"less than or equal to\" inequality. We introduce another non-negative slack variable, $s_{2} \\ge 0$, to convert it to an equality:\n    $$x_{1} - x_{2} + s_{2} = 2$$\n    The problem statement mentions **surplus variables**, which are used for \"greater than or equal to\" constraints with a non-negative RHS. For example, $a^T x \\ge b$ (with $b \\ge 0$) becomes $a^T x - s = b$. In this problem, after ensuring a non-negative RHS, the constraint became a $\\le$ type, thus requiring a slack variable instead of a surplus one. The variable $s_{2}$ provides a column $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ for the initial basis.\n\n3.  **Constraint 3: $x_{1} - x_{2} = 2$**\n    This is already an equality. However, to begin the simplex method, we need an initial Basic Feasible Solution (BFS), which is typically found by identifying an identity submatrix within the constraint matrix. The existing variables ($x_1, x_2, s_1, s_2$) do not provide a unit vector for this third constraint row. Therefore, we introduce a non-negative **artificial variable**, $a_{1} \\ge 0$.\n    $$x_{1} - x_{2} + a_{1} = 2$$\n    The artificial variable $a_{1}$ has no physical meaning and is a purely mathematical tool to obtain an initial BFS. It provides the column $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ needed to complete the initial identity basis.\n\nThe complete system in equality-standard form is:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx_{1} + 2x_{2} + s_{1} = 6 \\\\\nx_{1} - x_{2} + s_{2} = 2 \\\\\nx_{1} - x_{2} + a_{1} = 2\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwith all variables $x_{1}, x_{2}, s_{1}, s_{2}, a_{1} \\ge 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Phase I Setup**\n\nThe two-phase method is employed because of the presence of an artificial variable. Phase I has the sole objective of determining if a feasible solution to the original problem exists. This is achieved by minimizing the sum of all artificial variables. If the minimum value of this sum is $0$, then all artificial variables are zero, and we have found a BFS for the original problem. If the minimum is greater than $0$, the original problem is infeasible.\n\nIn this case, we have one artificial variable, $a_{1}$. The Phase I objective is to minimize $W = a_{1}$.\nThe simplex method is typically formulated as a maximization problem. Minimizing $W$ is equivalent to maximizing $-W$. Let the Phase I objective function be $Z_{I} = -W = -a_{1}$.\n\nTo use the simplex tableau, the objective function must be expressed solely in terms of non-basic variables. Initially, the basic variables are $\\{s_{1}, s_{2}, a_{1}\\}$ (forming an identity matrix), and the non-basic variables are $\\{x_{1}, x_{2}\\}$.\nFrom the third constraint, we express $a_{1}$ in terms of non-basic variables:\n$$a_{1} = 2 - x_{1} + x_{2}$$\nSubstituting this into the objective function $Z_{I}$:\n$$Z_{I} = -a_{1} = -(2 - x_{1} + x_{2}) = x_{1} - x_{2} - 2$$\nThe equation for the objective row in the simplex tableau is therefore $Z_{I} - x_{1} + x_{2} = -2$.\n\n**Step 3: Simplex Method for Phase I**\n\nWe construct the initial simplex tableau. The rows correspond to the basic variables $\\{s_{1}, s_{2}, a_{1}\\}$ and the objective function $Z_{I}$.\nInitial Tableau:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|ccccc|c}\n\\text{Basis}  Z_{I}  x_{1}  x_{2}  s_{1}  s_{2}  a_{1}  \\text{RHS} \\\\\n\\hline\ns_{1}  0  1  2  1  0  0  6 \\\\\ns_{2}  0  1  -1  0  1  0  2 \\\\\na_{1}  0  1  -1  0  0  1  2 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Obj}  1  -1  1  0  0  0  -2\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe initial BFS is $x_{1}=0, x_{2}=0, s_{1}=6, s_{2}=2, a_{1}=2$. The initial Phase I objective value is $W=a_{1}=2$, or $Z_{I}=-2$.\n\n**Iteration 1:**\n1.  **Select Entering Variable:** The entering variable is the non-basic variable with the most negative coefficient in the objective row. This is $x_{1}$ with a coefficient of $-1$.\n\n2.  **Select Leaving Variable (Min-Ratio Test):** We compute the ratio of the RHS to the corresponding positive coefficient in the entering variable's column ($x_{1}$).\n    *   Row $s_{1}$: $\\frac{6}{1} = 6$\n    *   Row $s_{2}$: $\\frac{2}{1} = 2$\n    *   Row $a_{1}$: $\\frac{2}{1} = 2$\n    There is a tie between the $s_{2}$ row and the $a_{1}$ row. A common tie-breaking rule is to choose the row that will drive an artificial variable out of the basis. We select $a_{1}$ as the leaving variable.\n\n3.  **Pivot Operation:** The pivot element is the entry in the entering column ($x_{1}$) and leaving row ($a_{1}$), which is $1$. We perform row operations to make the pivot column a unit vector with $1$ in the pivot position.\n    *   The pivot row (new $x_{1}$ row) is already in the desired form, since the pivot is $1$: $R'_{x_{1}} = R_{a_{1}}$.\n    *   New $s_{1}$ row: $R'_{s_{1}} = R_{s_{1}} - (1) R'_{x_{1}}$. This results in a row of $(0, 3, 1, 0, -1)$ with RHS $4$.\n    *   New $s_{2}$ row: $R'_{s_{2}} = R_{s_{2}} - (1) R'_{x_{1}}$. This results in a row of $(0, 0, 0, 1, -1)$ with RHS $0$.\n    *   New objective row: $R'_{\\text{Obj}} = R_{\\text{Obj}} - (-1) R'_{x_{1}}$. This results in a row of $(0, 0, 0, 0, 1)$ with RHS $0$.\n\nThe resulting tableau is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|ccccc|c}\n\\text{Basis}  Z_{I}  x_{1}  x_{2}  s_{1}  s_{2}  a_{1}  \\text{RHS} \\\\\n\\hline\ns_{1}  0  0  3  1  0  -1  4 \\\\\ns_{2}  0  0  0  0  1  -1  0 \\\\\nx_{1}  0  1  -1  0  0  1  2 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Obj}  1  0  0  0  0  1  0\n\\end{array}\n$$\nAll coefficients in the objective row are now non-negative ($\\ge 0$). This indicates that the optimal solution for the Phase I problem has been reached.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe optimal value of the Phase I objective function $Z_{I}$ is found in the RHS column of the objective row, which is $0$.\nSince $Z_{I} = -W = -a_{1}$, we have:\n$$Z_{I, \\text{max}} = 0 \\implies -W_{\\text{min}} = 0 \\implies W_{\\text{min}} = 0$$\nThe minimum value of the Phase I objective, which is the sum of the artificial variables ($W=a_{1}$), is $0$. This confirms that the original LP is feasible. The final BFS found at the end of Phase I is $x_{1}=2, s_{1}=4, s_{2}=0$ (and non-basic $x_{2}=0, a_{1}=0$).

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe task requires verifying two parts of a statement.\n\n**Part (i): Justification that $w^\\star > 0$ implies infeasibility.**\nThis is a core theorem of the two-phase method. The proof is by contraposition.\nLet the feasible set of the original LP be $S = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid Ax=b, x \\ge 0\\}$.\nLet the feasible set of the Phase I problem be $S_I = \\{(x,a) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\times \\mathbb{R}^m \\mid Ax+Ia=b, x \\ge 0, a \\ge 0\\}$.\nThe Phase I objective is $w = \\sum_{i=1}^m a_i$.\n\nAssume the original LP is feasible. This means the set $S$ is not empty. Let $x^*$ be any feasible solution, so $x^* \\in S$. This means $Ax^* = b$ and $x^* \\ge 0$.\nNow, consider the point $(x,a) = (x^*, 0)$, where $0$ is the zero vector in $\\mathbb{R}^m$. Let's check if this point belongs to the Phase I feasible set $S_I$:\n1. $x = x^* \\ge 0$. This condition is met.\n2. $a = 0 \\ge 0$. This condition is met.\n3. $Ax + Ia = Ax^* + I(0) = Ax^* = b$. This condition is met.\nThus, $(x^*, 0)$ is a feasible solution for the Phase I problem. The value of the Phase I objective function for this solution is $w = \\sum a_i = \\sum 0 = 0$.\n\nSince the Phase I problem seeks to minimize $w$, and we have found a feasible solution that achieves $w=0$, the optimal value $w^\\star$ must be less than or equal to $0$. Furthermore, since all $a_i \\ge 0$, the objective $w = \\sum a_i \\ge 0$. Therefore, if the original problem is feasible, the optimal value of the Phase I problem must be exactly $w^\\star=0$.\n\nThe contrapositive of this statement is: If the optimal value of the Phase I problem is not $0$ (i.e., $w^\\star > 0$), then the original LP must be infeasible. This proves the first part of the statement.\n\n**Part (ii): Construction of an example where an artificial variable persists and cannot be removed.**\nAn artificial variable $a_j$ can remain in the basis at the end of Phase I with a positive value if the original system of equations $Ax=b$ contains a contradiction. This typically occurs when a row of matrix $A$ is a zero vector, but the corresponding element in vector $b$ is non-zero.\n\nLet's consider the $j$-th constraint of the original system: $\\sum_{k=1}^n A_{jk} x_k = b_j$.\nIf $A_{jk}=0$ for all $k=1, \\dots, n$, this constraint becomes $0=b_j$. If $b_j \\ne 0$, the system is inherently inconsistent and thus infeasible.\n\nIn the Phase I formulation, this constraint becomes $\\sum_{k=1}^n A_{jk} x_k + a_j = b_j$. With $A_{jk}=0$ for all $k$, this simplifies to $a_j = b_j$.\nIf we ensure $b_j > 0$ (by multiplying the row by $-1$ if necessary, as is standard procedure), then any feasible solution to the Phase I problem must have $a_j = b_j > 0$.\nThis forces the Phase I objective $w = \\sum a_i \\ge a_j = b_j > 0$. The optimal value $w^\\star$ will therefore be strictly positive.\n\nNow, consider the simplex method's pivoting process. To remove the basic variable $a_j$ from the basis, we would need to pivot in a non-basic variable. The candidates are the original variables $x_k$. A pivot on column $k$ in row $j$ is only possible if the tableau entry in that position is non-zero (specifically, positive for the minimum ratio test). The tableau row corresponding to the basic variable $a_j$ contains the coefficients of the non-basic variables in the expression for $a_j$. In our constructed case, the constraint is $a_j = b_j - \\sum_{k=1}^n A_{jk} x_k$. Since all $A_{jk}=0$, the coefficients of all $x_k$ in this row are $0$. Thus, no variable $x_k$ can be pivoted into the basis to replace $a_j$. The artificial variable $a_j$ must remain in the basis at its positive value $b_j$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Take $$A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{bmatrix}, b = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix},$$ and $x \\ge 0$. In Phase I, the constraints are $x_1 + a_1 = 1$ and $0 \\cdot x_1 + 0 \\cdot x_2 + a_2 = 1$. The Phase I objective is $w = a_1 + a_2$. Since the second row enforces $a_2 = 1$ regardless of $x$, the minimum $w^\\star$ is at least $1$. Because any feasible solution to the original LP would require $a = 0$ and hence yield $w = 0$, $w^\\star > 0$ proves infeasibility. No pivot can remove $a_2$ from the basis because the second row has zero coefficients in all original variable columns, so there is no entering non-artificial variable to reduce $a_2$; the artificial column $a_2$ is the only nonzero in that row.**\n\n- **Justification of Infeasibility:** The option correctly states that a feasible original solution would imply a Phase I solution with $w=0$, so $w^\\star > 0$ proves infeasibility. This logic is correct.\n- **Construction:** The example represents the system $x_1 = 1$ and $0=1$. The second equation is a contradiction, so the original LP is infeasible.\n- **Phase I Analysis:** The Phase I constraints are given as $x_1 + a_1 = 1$ and $a_2 = 1$ (assuming $x=[x_1, x_2]^T$). From $a_2=1$, it is necessary that any Phase I feasible solution has $a_2=1$, and thus $w = a_1+a_2 \\ge 1$. The minimum value is $w^\\star = 1$, achieved at $(x_1, x_2, a_1, a_2) = (1, 0, 0, 1)$. Since $w^\\star > 0$, the original LP is correctly identified as infeasible.\n- **Pivot Analysis:** The option correctly explains why $a_2$ cannot be removed. The second constraint row involves only $a_2$. In the simplex tableau, the row corresponding to the basic variable $a_2$ would have coefficients of $0$ in the columns for $x_1$ and $x_2$. Therefore, neither $x_1$ nor $x_2$ can be chosen as an entering variable to pivot out $a_2$.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option provides a sound logical justification and a perfect, illustrative example.\n\n**B. Take $$A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{bmatrix}, b = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix},$$ and $x \\ge 0$. In Phase I, one artificial variable remains positive at optimality due to degeneracy, yet the original LP is feasible with $x_1 = 1$, $x_2 = 0$, showing that $w^\\star > 0$ does not imply infeasibility.**\n\n- **Analysis:** The original system is $x_1=1$, $x_2=0$, which is clearly feasible. If Phase I is performed, we want to minimize $w=\\sum a_i$. We can simply choose $x_1=1, x_2=0$, which satisfies $Ax=b$. This corresponds to a Phase I solution where all artificial variables $a_i$ are $0$. Therefore, the optimal value is $w^\\star=0$. The option's premise that an artificial variable \"remains positive\" leading to $w^\\star > 0$ is false for this example. The conclusion that \"$w^\\star > 0$ does not imply infeasibility\" contradicts the fundamental theorem of the two-phase method. Degeneracy can cause an artificial variable to remain in the basis at the end of Phase I, but only with a value of $0$ if the problem is feasible.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The reasoning is fundamentally flawed.\n\n**C. Take $$A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1  1 \\end{bmatrix}, b = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\end{bmatrix},$$ and $x \\ge 0$. Degeneracy can cause $w^\\star > 0$ even though the original LP has feasible points such as $x_1 = 1$, $x_2 = 0$, so positivity of artificial variables at Phase I optimality does not conclusively indicate infeasibility.**\n\n- **Analysis:** The original system is $x_1+x_2=1$, which has many feasible solutions (e.g., $x_1=1, x_2=0$). For any such solution, the corresponding Phase I solution would have $a_1=0$. Therefore, the minimum value is $w^\\star=0$. The option's claim that \"$w^\\star > 0$\" could occur is false. It makes the same fundamental error as option B, conflating the possibility of a degenerate artificial basic variable (with value $0$) with a positive artificial variable (which implies $w^\\star > 0$).\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The reasoning is fundamentally flawed.\n\n**D. Take $$A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1  -1 \\end{bmatrix}, b = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\end{bmatrix},$$ and $x \\ge 0$. In Phase I, an artificial variable must remain positive because the right-hand side is negative, and no pivot can remove it; however, this does not imply infeasibility as the negativity of $b$ can always be resolved later.**\n\n- **Analysis:** The standard procedure for the simplex method requires the right-hand side vector $b$ to be non-negative before adding artificial variables. The given constraint $x_1 - x_2 = -1$ must first be multiplied by $-1$ to get $-x_1 + x_2 = 1$. The Phase I problem for this equivalent system is to minimize $w=a_1$ subject to $-x_1 + x_2 + a_1 = 1$. This can be solved with $a_1=0$ (e.g., by setting $x_1=0, x_2=1$). Thus, $w^\\star=0$. The option's premise is based on an incorrect application of the two-phase method. Handling the negative RHS is a prerequisite for Phase I, not something to be \"resolved later\".\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This option describes an improper application of the two-phase method and draws confused conclusions from it.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3194559"}]}
