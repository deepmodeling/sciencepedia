By translating resource constraints into a system of linear inequalities, you will define a feasible region for production. The theorem simplifies the search for maximum profit by assuring us the optimal solution lies at one of the vertices of this region, turning an infinite set of possibilities into a handful of candidates to check [@problem_id:2168954].", "problem": "A small artisanal company manufactures two types of specialized electronic components: Type A and Type B. The production of these components is subject to several daily constraints related to resources and labor. Let $x$ be the number of Type A units and $y$ be the number of Type B units produced daily.\n\nThe profit for each Type A component sold is $100, and for each Type B component is $200.\n\nThe production is constrained by the following factors:\n1.  **Assembly Time:** Each component, whether Type A or Type B, requires one hour of skilled labor for assembly. The company has a total of 40 hours of skilled labor available per day.\n2.  **Raw Material:** A specific rare material is used exclusively for Type A components. The daily supply of this material is only sufficient to produce a maximum of 30 units of Type A.\n3.  **Non-negativity:** The number of components produced cannot be negative.\n\nAssuming the company can sell all the components it produces, what is the maximum possible daily profit?
