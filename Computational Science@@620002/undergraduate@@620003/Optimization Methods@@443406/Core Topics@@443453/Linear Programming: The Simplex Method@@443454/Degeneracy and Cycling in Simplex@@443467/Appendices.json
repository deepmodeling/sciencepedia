The solution proceeds.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem asks for an analysis of the basic feasible solution (BFS) associated with the basis $\\mathcal{B} = \\{1, 2\\}$.\n\nFirst, we define the basic and nonbasic matrices and vectors.\nThe basic matrix $\\boldsymbol{B}$ consists of columns $1$ and $2$ of $\\boldsymbol{A}$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{B} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1 \\\\ 1  2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe cost vector for the basic variables is $\\boldsymbol{c}_{\\mathcal{B}}$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{c}_{\\mathcal{B}} = \\begin{pmatrix} c_1 \\\\ c_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe nonbasic columns of $\\boldsymbol{A}$ are collected in $\\boldsymbol{N}$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{A_N} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\boldsymbol{A}_3  \\boldsymbol{A}_4  \\boldsymbol{A}_5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  2  0 \\\\ 2  3  1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nTo find the BFS, we compute the values of the basic variables $\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\mathcal{B}} = (x_1, x_2)^{\\top}$ using $\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\mathcal{B}} = \\boldsymbol{B}^{-1}\\boldsymbol{b}$. The nonbasic variables $\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\mathcal{N}} = (x_3, x_4, x_5)^{\\top}$ are set to $\\boldsymbol{0}$.\n\nWe find the inverse of $\\boldsymbol{B}$:\n$$ \\det(\\boldsymbol{B}) = (1)(2) - (1)(1) = 1 $$\n$$ \\boldsymbol{B}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{1} \\begin{pmatrix} 2  -1 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  -1 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow, we compute the values of the basic variables:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{x}_{\\mathcal{B}} = \\boldsymbol{B}^{-1}\\boldsymbol{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  -1 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2(1) - 1(1) \\\\ -1(1) + 1(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSo, the basic variables are $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2 = 0$. The full BFS is $\\boldsymbol{x} = (1, 0, 0, 0, 0)^{\\top}$. Since one of the basic variables ($x_2$) is zero, the BFS is degenerate, confirming the problem statement.\n\nNext, we compute the reduced costs for the nonbasic variables $j \\in \\mathcal{N} = \\{3, 4, 5\\}$. The reduced cost $\\bar{c}_j$ is defined by $\\bar{c}_j = c_j - \\boldsymbol{y}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{A}_j$, where $\\boldsymbol{A}_j$ is the $j$-th column of $\\boldsymbol{A}$ and $\\boldsymbol{y}^{\\top} = \\boldsymbol{c}_{\\mathcal{B}}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{B}^{-1}$ is the vector of simplex multipliers (dual variables).\n\nFirst, we compute $\\boldsymbol{y}^{\\top}$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{y}^{\\top} = \\boldsymbol{c}_{\\mathcal{B}}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{B}^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2  -1 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow we can compute the reduced costs:\nFor $j=3$: $\\bar{c}_3 = c_3 - \\boldsymbol{y}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{A}_3 = 2 - \\begin{pmatrix} 2  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = 2 - (4 - 2) = 2 - 2 = 0$.\nFor $j=4$: $\\bar{c}_4 = c_4 - \\boldsymbol{y}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{A}_4 = 1 - \\begin{pmatrix} 2  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} = 1 - (4 - 3) = 1 - 1 = 0$.\nFor $j=5$: $\\bar{c}_5 = c_5 - \\boldsymbol{y}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{A}_5 = -1 - \\begin{pmatrix} 2  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = -1 - (0 - 1) = -1 - (-1) = 0$.\n\nAll three nonbasic variables, $x_3$, $x_4$, and $x_5$, have zero reduced cost.\n\nFinally, for each of these nonbasic variables, we determine the step length from the minimum ratio test. A pivot is degenerate if this step length is zero.\nIf we choose a nonbasic variable $x_j$ to enter the basis, the change in the basic variables is given by $\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\mathcal{B}}(\\alpha) = \\boldsymbol{x}_{\\mathcal{B}} - \\alpha \\boldsymbol{u}_j$, where $\\alpha$ is the step length and $\\boldsymbol{u}_j = \\boldsymbol{B}^{-1}\\boldsymbol{A}_j$.\nTo maintain feasibility ($\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\mathcal{B}}(\\alpha) \\geq \\boldsymbol{0}$), the maximum step length is given by the minimum ratio test:\n$$ \\alpha = \\min_{i: (u_j)_i  0} \\left\\{ \\frac{(\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\mathcal{B}})_i}{(\\boldsymbol{u}_j)_i} \\right\\} $$\nA step length of $\\alpha=0$ occurs if there is an index $i$ such that $(\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\mathcal{B}})_i = 0$ and the corresponding $(\\boldsymbol{u}_j)_i  0$. In our case, $(\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\mathcal{B}})_2 = x_2 = 0$. So we check each case for $(\\boldsymbol{u}_j)_2  0$.\n\nCase 1: $x_3$ enters the basis ($j=3$).\n$$ \\boldsymbol{u}_3 = \\boldsymbol{B}^{-1}\\boldsymbol{A}_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  -1 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 - 2 \\\\ -2 + 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe components of $\\boldsymbol{u}_3$ are $(\\boldsymbol{u}_3)_1 = 2$ and $(\\boldsymbol{u}_3)_2 = 0$.\nThe minimum ratio test considers only entries where $(\\boldsymbol{u}_3)_i  0$. Here, this is only for $i=1$.\nThe step length is $\\alpha = \\frac{(\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\mathcal{B}})_1}{(\\boldsymbol{u}_3)_1} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since $\\alpha  0$, this is not a degenerate pivot.\n\nCase 2: $x_4$ enters the basis ($j=4$).\n$$ \\boldsymbol{u}_4 = \\boldsymbol{B}^{-1}\\boldsymbol{A}_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  -1 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 - 3 \\\\ -2 + 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe components of $\\boldsymbol{u}_4$ are $(\\boldsymbol{u}_4)_1 = 1$ and $(\\boldsymbol{u}_4)_2 = 1$. Both are positive.\nWe compute the ratios:\nFor $i=1$: $\\frac{(\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\mathcal{B}})_1}{(\\boldsymbol{u}_4)_1} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$.\nFor $i=2$: $\\frac{(\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\mathcal{B}})_2}{(\\boldsymbol{u}_4)_2} = \\frac{0}{1} = 0$.\nThe step length is $\\alpha = \\min(1, 0) = 0$. This corresponds to a degenerate pivot.\n\nCase 3: $x_5$ enters the basis ($j=5$).\n$$ \\boldsymbol{u}_5 = \\boldsymbol{B}^{-1}\\boldsymbol{A}_5 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  -1 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 - 1 \\\\ 0 + 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe components of $\\boldsymbol{u}_5$ are $(\\boldsymbol{u}_5)_1 = -1$ and $(\\boldsymbol{u}_5)_2 = 1$.\nThe minimum ratio test considers only $i=2$ since $(\\boldsymbol{u}_5)_2  0$.\nThe ratio for $i=2$ is $\\frac{(\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\mathcal{B}})_2}{(\\boldsymbol{u}_5)_2} = \\frac{0}{1} = 0$.\nThe step length is $\\alpha = 0$. This corresponds to a degenerate pivot.\n\nThe nonbasic variables that have zero reduced cost and also define an adjacent edge with zero step length (i.e., cause a degenerate pivot) are $x_4$ and $x_5$.

Explore the consequences of three distinct leaving-variable tie-break rules when the minimum ratio test yields a tie:\n- Rule $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{min}}$: choose the leaving row with the smallest row index among the tied rows.\n- Rule $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{max}}$: choose the leaving row with the largest row index among the tied rows.\n- Rule $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{Bland}}$: Bland’s anti-cycling rule restricted to the tied leaving candidates, i.e., choose the leaving basic variable with the smallest index among the tied rows; for the entering side, follow the entering-variable convention already stated (smallest index among those with maximal strictly positive reduced cost).\n\nStarting from the given tableau, for each rule independently:\n- Perform the pivot determined by the rule and then continue applying the simplex method according to the conventions above until either no strictly positive reduced cost remains (indicating optimality) or a previously seen basis recurs (indicating cycling).\n- Record whether cycling occurs under that rule.\n\nLet $C$ denote the number of the three rules under which cycling occurs for this tableau. Report the single value $C$. No rounding is required, and no units are involved. The final answer must be a single real-valued number.", "solution": "We begin from the provided tableau\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc|c}\n  x_{1}  x_{2}  s_{1}  s_{2}  \\text{RHS} \\\\\\hline\ns_{1}  1  0  1  0  0 \\\\\ns_{2}  1  1  0  1  0 \\\\\\hline\nz  2  0  0  0  0\n\\end{array}\n$$\nBy Dantzig’s rule for entering variables, we select $x_{1}$ because its reduced cost is $2$, which is strictly greater than $0$ for $x_{2}$. The minimum ratio test uses $b_{i}/a_{i1}$ over rows with $a_{i1}  0$. Here, $a_{11} = 1$, $a_{21} = 1$, and both right-hand sides are $0$, so the ratios are $0/1 = 0$ in both rows. This produces a tie and a degenerate pivot regardless of which row leaves.\n\nWe now analyze each leaving-variable tie-break rule in turn.\n\nCase $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{min}}$ (smallest row index leaves):\n- Entering variable: $x_{1}$.\n- Leaving row: the smallest index among ties is the first constraint row, so $s_{1}$ leaves. The pivot element is the $(1,1)$ entry, which equals $1$.\n\nPerform the pivot operations. Divide the pivot row by $1$ (no change). Eliminate the $x_{1}$-column entries from the other rows:\n- New second row: old second row minus old first row,\n$$\n[\\,1,\\,1,\\,0,\\,1\\,|\\,0\\,] - [\\,1,\\,0,\\,1,\\,0\\,|\\,0\\,] = [\\,0,\\,1,\\,-1,\\,1\\,|\\,0\\,].\n$$\n- New $z$-row: old $z$-row minus $2$ times the old first row,\n$$\n[\\,2,\\,0,\\,0,\\,0\\,|\\,0\\,] - 2\\cdot[\\,1,\\,0,\\,1,\\,0\\,|\\,0\\,] = [\\,0,\\,0,\\,-2,\\,0\\,|\\,0\\,].\n$$\nThe updated tableau is\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc|c}\n  x_{1}  x_{2}  s_{1}  s_{2}  \\text{RHS} \\\\\\hline\nx_{1}  1  0  1  0  0 \\\\\ns_{2}  0  1  -1  1  0 \\\\\\hline\nz  0  0  -2  0  0\n\\end{array}\n$$\nNow check the reduced costs: the only nonbasic decision variable is $x_{2}$ with reduced cost $0$, which is not strictly positive, so there is no eligible entering variable. The algorithm terminates immediately with no further pivots. There is no repetition of a previous basis, so no cycling occurs under $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{min}}$.\n\nCase $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{max}}$ (largest row index leaves):\n- Entering variable: $x_{1}$.\n- Leaving row: the largest index among ties is the second constraint row, so $s_{2}$ leaves. The pivot element is the $(2,1)$ entry, which equals $1$.\n\nPerform the pivot operations. Divide the pivot row by $1$ (no change). Eliminate the $x_{1}$-column entries from the other rows:\n- New first row: old first row minus old second row,\n$$\n[\\,1,\\,0,\\,1,\\,0\\,|\\,0\\,] - [\\,1,\\,1,\\,0,\\,1\\,|\\,0\\,] = [\\,0,\\,-1,\\,1,\\,-1\\,|\\,0\\,].\n$$\n- New $z$-row: old $z$-row minus $2$ times the old second row,\n$$\n[\\,2,\\,0,\\,0,\\,0\\,|\\,0\\,] - 2\\cdot[\\,1,\\,1,\\,0,\\,1\\,|\\,0\\,] = [\\,0,\\,-2,\\,0,\\,-2\\,|\\,0\\,].\n$$\nThe updated tableau is\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc|c}\n  x_{1}  x_{2}  s_{1}  s_{2}  \\text{RHS} \\\\\\hline\ns_{1}  0  -1  1  -1  0 \\\\\nx_{1}  1  1  0  1  0 \\\\\\hline\nz  0  -2  0  -2  0\n\\end{array}\n$$\nNow check the reduced costs: the only nonbasic decision variable is $x_{2}$ with reduced cost $-2$, which is not strictly positive in our maximization convention. Hence no variable is eligible to enter, and the algorithm terminates immediately. No repetition of a previous basis occurs, so no cycling under $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{max}}$.\n\nCase $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{Bland}}$ (Bland’s anti-cycling tie-break among leaving candidates; smallest-index entering among those with maximal strictly positive reduced cost):\n- Entering variable: the only strictly positive reduced cost is for $x_{1}$, so $x_{1}$ enters. Among the tied leaving candidates, Bland’s rule selects the smallest-index basic variable, which is $s_{1}$. Therefore this case produces exactly the same pivot as $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{min}}$, and the resulting tableau is\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc|c}\n  x_{1}  x_{2}  s_{1}  s_{2}  \\text{RHS} \\\\\\hline\nx_{1}  1  0  1  0  0 \\\\\ns_{2}  0  1  -1  1  0 \\\\\\hline\nz  0  0  -2  0  0\n\\end{array}\n$$\nAs before, there are no strictly positive reduced costs, so the algorithm stops immediately. No cycling occurs under $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{Bland}}$.\n\nConclusion. For each of the three tie-break rules, the simplex method performs a single degenerate pivot and then terminates with no strictly positive reduced costs, and no basis is ever revisited. Therefore, if $C$ denotes the number of rules under which cycling occurs for this tableau, we have $C = 0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3117207"}]}
