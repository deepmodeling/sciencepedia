The problem is purely mathematical, dealing with linear algebra concepts (matrices, LU factorization, Gaussian elimination, determinants). These are well-established mathematical topics.\n- **Well-Posed?** Yes. The matrix is explicitly defined. The task is to find a specific factorization and calculate a determinant. The condition \"without row exchanges\" makes the process deterministic. The existence of an LU factorization without pivoting depends on the leading principal minors of $A$ being non-zero. I need to check this as I perform the elimination. If a zero pivot is encountered, the factorization *without pivoting* does not exist, and the problem might be ill-posed in that regard. However, the problem asks me to *derive* it, implying that it exists. I will proceed with the calculation, and if it succeeds, the problem is well-posed. If it fails (zero pivot), then the problem is invalid because it asks for something that doesn't exist. Let's start constructing the matrix and see.\n\nFor $n=6$, the matrix $A$ is:\n$A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\\\\n3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\\\\n4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\\\\n5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\\\\n6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11\n\\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis is a Hankel matrix. The question is whether an LU factorization without pivoting exists. Let's perform the first step of Gaussian elimination.\nThe first pivot is $A_{11} = 1 \\neq 0$. This is good.\n\nRow operations:\n- $R_2 \\leftarrow R_2 - (2/1)R_1$\n- $R_3 \\leftarrow R_3 - (3/1)R_1$\n- ...\n- $R_6 \\leftarrow R_6 - (6/1)R_1$\n\nLet's compute the new second row:\n$[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] - 2 \\times [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] = [0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5]$\n\nThe new third row:\n$[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] - 3 \\times [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] = [0, -2, -4, -6, -8, -10]$\n\nThe new fourth row:\n$[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] - 4 \\times [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] = [0, -3, -6, -9, -12, -15]$\n\n...and so on.\nThe matrix after the first step is:\n$A^{(1)} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n0 & -1 & -2 & -3 & -4 & -5 \\\\\n0 & -2 & -4 & -6 & -8 & -10 \\\\\n0 & -3 & -6 & -9 & -12 & -15 \\\\\n0 & -4 & -8 & -12 & -16 & -20 \\\\\n0 & -5 & -10 & -15 & -20 & -25\n\\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe second pivot is $A^{(1)}_{22} = -1 \\neq 0$. This is also good.\n\nNow, let's perform the second step of Gaussian elimination. The multipliers will be:\n- $l_{32} = (-2)/(-1) = 2$\n- $l_{42} = (-3)/(-1) = 3$\n- $l_{52} = (-4)/(-1) = 4$\n- $l_{62} = (-5)/(-1) = 5$\n\nOperations:\n- $R_3 \\leftarrow R_3 - 2 R_2$\n- $R_4 \\leftarrow R_4 - 3 R_2$\n- ...\n\nLet's compute the new third row:\n$[0, -2, -4, -6, -8, -10] - 2 \\times [0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$\n\nOh. The third row becomes all zeros.\nThis means the third pivot is $A^{(2)}_{33} = 0$.\nGaussian elimination without pivoting cannot proceed. The matrix is singular.\n\nThe problem asks to *derive* the LU factorization. My derivation shows that standard Gaussian elimination without pivoting will lead to a zero on the diagonal of the intermediate matrix. This means the matrix $U$ will have a zero on its diagonal. The procedure does not fail, but it produces a singular $U$. This is perfectly valid. The singularity of the matrix means the determinant will be zero. Let's continue.\n\nThe matrix after the second step:\n$R_3 \\leftarrow R_3 - 2R_2$: $[0, -2, -4, ...] - 2[0, -1, -2, ...] = [0, 0, 0, ...]$. So $R_3$ becomes a zero row.\n$R_4 \\leftarrow R_4 - 3R_2$: $[0, -3, -6, ...] - 3[0, -1, -2, ...] = [0, 0, 0, ...]$. So $R_4$ becomes a zero row.\nAnd so on for $R_5$ and $R_6$.\n\nSo the matrix $U$ will be:\n$U = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n0 & -1 & -2 & -3 & -4 & -5 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe matrix $L$ is formed by the multipliers:\n$l_{i1} = A_{i1}/A_{11} = i/1 = i$ for $i=2,...,6$.\n$l_{i2} = A^{(1)}_{i2}/A^{(1)}_{22} = (-(i-1))/(-1) = i-1$ for $i=3,...,6$.\nWait, the multiplier is $l_{ij} = a_{ij}^{(j-1)} / a_{jj}^{(j-1)}$.\n$l_{21} = 2/1 = 2$\n$l_{31} = 3/1 = 3$\n$l_{41} = 4/1 = 4$\n$l_{51} = 5/1 = 5$\n$l_{61} = 6/1 = 6$\n\nFrom matrix $A^{(1)}$:\n$l_{32} = (-2)/(-1) = 2$\n$l_{42} = (-3)/(-1) = 3$\n$l_{52} = (-4)/(-1) = 4$\n$l_{62} = (-5)/(-1) = 5$\n\nSince all subsequent rows become zero, the remaining multipliers are not uniquely defined, but we can set them to anything. Usually, they are not needed. The process stops. We have $L$ and $U$.\nThe matrix $L$ should be:\n$L = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n3 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n4 & 3 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ % Something is wrong here.\n5 & 4 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n6 & 5 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}$\nThe elimination process for row $k$ onwards stops if the pivot $a_{kk}^{(k-1)}$ is zero.\nSo we have $U$ as above.\n$L$ has multipliers $l_{i,j}$ for $i>j$.\n$l_{21}=2, l_{31}=3, l_{41}=4, l_{51}=5, l_{61}=6$.\n$l_{32}=2, l_{42}=3, l_{52}=4, l_{62}=5$.\nSince $U_{33}=0$, the algorithm stops or has issues. But we can continue formally.\nThe matrix after step 2 is\n$A^{(2)} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n0 & -1 & -2 & -3 & -4 & -5 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}$\nThis is the final upper triangular matrix $U$.\nThe multipliers for the subsequent columns ($j=3, 4, 5$) are not needed because the rows to be eliminated are already zero.\nSo the matrix $L$ is\n$L = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n3 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n4 & 3 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ % Wait, no. What are l_43, l_53, l_63?\n\\end{pmatrix}$\nIn step 3, we would calculate $l_{i3} = A^{(2)}_{i3} / A^{(2)}_{33}$. But $A^{(2)}_{33} = 0$. So division by zero occurs.\nThis means the standard algorithm to populate $L$ fails.\nLet's check the Doolittle algorithm formulation: $A=LU$.\n$A_{ij} = \\sum_{k=1}^n L_{ik} U_{kj}$. Since $L$ is unit lower triangular ($L_{ik}=0$ for $k>i$, $L_{ii}=1$) and $U$ is upper triangular ($U_{kj}=0$ for $k>j$), this simplifies.\n$A_{ij} = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\min(i,j)} L_{ik} U_{kj}$.\n\nLet's try to find $L$ and $U$ directly.\n$U$ has the form\n$U = \\begin{pmatrix}\nu_{11} & u_{12} & u_{13} & u_{14} & u_{15} & u_{16} \\\\\n0 & u_{22} & u_{23} & u_{24} & u_{25} & u_{26} \\\\\n0 & 0 & u_{33} & u_{34} & u_{35} & u_{36} \\\\\n\\vdots & & & & & \\vdots \\\\\n0 & \\dots & & & & u_{66}\n\\end{pmatrix}$\n$L$ has the form\n$L = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & \\dots \\\\\nl_{21} & 1 & 0 & \\dots \\\\\nl_{31} & l_{32} & 1 & 0 & \\dots \\\\\n\\vdots & & & & & \\vdots \\\\\nl_{61} & l_{62} & \\dots & l_{65} & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}$\n\nFrom Gaussian elimination, the first two rows of $U$ are:\n$u_{1j} = A_{1j} = j$. So $U_{1,:} = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]$.\nThe multipliers for the first column are $l_{i1} = A_{i1}/u_{11} = (i+1-1)/1 = i$. So $l_{i1}=i$ for $i=2,...,6$.\n\nThe second row of $U$ is computed from the first stage matrix $A^{(1)}$.\n$A^{(1)}_{ij} = A_{ij} - l_{i1} u_{1j} = (i+j-1) - i \\cdot j$. This is for $i,j \\ge 2$.\n$A^{(1)}_{2j} = (2+j-1) - 2 \\cdot j = j+1 - 2j = 1-j$.\nSo $U_{2,:} = [0, A^{(1)}_{22}, A^{(1)}_{23}, A^{(1)}_{24}, A^{(1)}_{25}, A^{(1)}_{26}]$\n$U_{22} = A^{(1)}_{22} = 1-2 = -1$.\n$U_{23} = A^{(1)}_{23} = 1-3 = -2$.\n$U_{2j} = 1-j$ for $j \\ge 2$. Wait, that's not what I got before.\nLet's re-calculate $R_2 - 2R_1$:\n$[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] - 2 \\times [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] = [0, 3-4, 4-6, 5-8, 6-10, 7-12] = [0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5]$. My previous calculation was correct.\nWhere did $A^{(1)}_{2j} = 1-j$ come from?\n$A_{ij} = i+j-1$.\n$A^{(1)}_{ij} = A_{ij} - (A_{i1}/A_{11}) A_{1j} = (i+j-1) - (i/1)(j) = i+j-1-ij$. This is not $1-j$. That was calculation for $i=2$.\nFor $i=2$: $A^{(1)}_{2j} = (2+j-1) - (2/1)(j) = j+1-2j = 1-j$. This is the second row of $A^{(1)}$.\nSo $u_{2j} = 1-j$ for $j \\ge 2$?\n$u_{22} = 1-2 = -1$.\n$u_{23} = 1-3 = -2$.\n$u_{24} = 1-4 = -3$.\n$u_{25} = 1-5 = -4$.\n$u_{26} = 1-6 = -5$.\nThis matches my manual calculation $[0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5]$. Ok, so far so good.\n\nNow for the next stage.\nThe multipliers for the second column are $l_{i2} = A^{(1)}_{i2} / u_{22}$.\n$A^{(1)}_{i2} = i+2-1 - i \\cdot 2 = i+1 - 2i = 1-i$.\n$u_{22} = -1$.\nSo $l_{i2} = (1-i)/(-1) = i-1$ for $i=3,...,6$.\nThis also matches my previous calculation ($l_{32}=2, l_{42}=3$, etc).\n\nNow the third stage, matrix $A^{(2)}$.\n$A^{(2)}_{ij} = A^{(1)}_{ij} - l_{i2} u_{2j}$ for $i,j \\ge 3$.\n$A^{(1)}_{ij} = i+j-1-ij$.\n$u_{2j} = 1-j$.\n$l_{i2} = i-1$.\n$A^{(2)}_{ij} = (i+j-1-ij) - (i-1)(1-j) = i+j-1-ij - (i-ij-1+j) = i+j-1-ij - i+ij+1-j = 0$.\nSo $A^{(2)}_{ij} = 0$ for all $i,j \\ge 3$.\nThis confirms my calculation that all rows from the third one become zero after the second step of Gaussian elimination.\nSo the matrix $U$ is indeed:\n$U = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n0 & -1 & -2 & -3 & -4 & -5 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}$\n\nAnd the matrix $L$ is populated with the multipliers:\n$l_{i1} = i$ for $i>1$. Column 1 of L is $[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]^T$.\n$l_{i2} = i-1$ for $i>2$. Column 2 of L below the diagonal is $[(3-1), (4-1), (5-1), (6-1)]^T = [2, 3, 4, 5]^T$.\nWe don't need any more multipliers since $A^{(2)}$ is the zero matrix (for $i,j \\ge 3$). So $l_{i,j}$ for $j \\ge 3$ are not determined by the elimination process in the sense that no further elimination is needed. But for the $A=LU$ identity to hold, we need to determine the rest of $L$.\nLet's check $A=LU$.\n$L = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n3 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n4 & 3 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ % these ones are arbitrary. Let's make it easy.\n5 & 4 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n6 & 5 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}$\n$U = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n0 & -1 & -2 & -3 & -4 & -5 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}$\nLet's compute $A_{ij} = (LU)_{ij} = \\sum_{k=1}^j L_{ik} U_{kj}$ for $i \\ge j$.\n$A_{34} = L_{31}U_{14} + L_{32}U_{24} + L_{33}U_{34} = 3 \\cdot 4 + 2 \\cdot (-3) + 1 \\cdot 0 = 12 - 6 = 6$.\nThe original matrix has $A_{34} = 3+4-1 = 6$. This matches.\n$A_{45} = L_{41}U_{15} + L_{42}U_{25} + L_{43}U_{35} + L_{44}U_{45} = 4 \\cdot 5 + 3 \\cdot (-4) + L_{43} \\cdot 0 + 1 \\cdot 0 = 20-12=8$.\nThe original $A_{45} = 4+5-1 = 8$. This matches.\nWhat are the entries $L_{i,j}$ for $j\\ge 3$?\nThe equation $A_{ij} = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\min(i,j)} L_{ik}U_{kj}$ for $i,j \\ge 3$ must hold.\n$A_{ij} = L_{i1} U_{1j} + L_{i2} U_{2j} + \\sum_{k=3}^{\\min(i,j)} L_{ik}U_{kj}$.\nSince $U_{kj}=0$ for $k \\ge 3$, this becomes:\n$A_{ij} = L_{i1} U_{1j} + L_{i2} U_{2j}$.\nLet's check this. We should have $A_{ij} = i \\cdot j + (i-1) \\cdot (1-j)$.\n$i \\cdot j + (i-1)(1-j) = ij + (i - ij - 1 + j) = i+j-1$.\nThis is exactly $A_{ij}$.\nSo this equation holds for all $i,j$.\nThis means that the values of $L_{ik}$ for $k \\ge 3$ do not matter at all, since they are multiplied by zero entries of $U$.\nThe problem asks for \"the\" unit lower triangular... factorization. The fact that parts of $L$ are arbitrary might make the problem \"ill-posed\" as it doesn't have a unique solution. However, in the context of \"using the algorithm of Gaussian elimination\", it refers to the specific output of that algorithm. The algorithm is:\nInitialize $U=A$, $L=I$.\nFor $k=1$ to $n-1$:\n  if $U_{kk} == 0$, stop/error (or pivot).\n  For $i=k+1$ to $n$:\n    $L_{ik} = U_{ik} / U_{kk}$\n    For $j=k$ to $n$:\n      $U_{ij} = U_{ij} - L_{ik} U_{kj}$\n\nLet's trace this precisely.\nStart: $U=A$, $L=I$.\nk=1:\n  $U_{11}=1 \\neq 0$.\n  i=2: $L_{21} = U_{21}/U_{11} = 2/1 = 2$. $U_{2,:} = U_{2,:} - 2 U_{1,:} \\rightarrow [0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5]$.\n  i=3: $L_{31} = U_{31}/U_{11} = 3/1 = 3$. $U_{3,:} = U_{3,:} - 3 U_{1,:} \\rightarrow [0, -2, -4, -6, -8, -10]$.\n  ...\n  i=6: $L_{61} = 6/1 = 6$. $U_{6,:} = U_{6,:} - 6 U_{1,:} \\rightarrow [0, -5, -10, -15, -20, -25]$.\nAfter k=1, $U$ is my previously computed $A^{(1)}$ and column 1 of $L$ is populated.\n\nk=2:\n  $U_{22}=-1 \\neq 0$.\n  i=3: $L_{32} = U_{32}/U_{22} = -2/-1 = 2$. $U_{3,:} = U_{3,:} - 2 U_{2,:} \\rightarrow [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$.\n  i=4: $L_{42} = U_{42}/U_{22} = -3/-1 = 3$. $U_{4,:} = U_{4,:} - 3 U_{2,:} \\rightarrow [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$.\n  ...\n  i=6: $L_{62} = U_{62}/U_{22} = -5/-1 = 5$. $U_{6,:} = U_{6,:} - 5 U_{2,:} \\rightarrow [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$.\nAfter k=2, $U$ is my $A^{(2)}$ and column 2 of $L$ is populated.\n\nk=3:\n  $U_{33}=0$. The algorithm as stated would stop here.\nThe problem statement says \"using the algorithm of Gaussian elimination\". This standard algorithm stops.\nDoes this invalidate the problem? The problem asks to *derive* the factorization. The derivation leads to a singular $U$. If the algorithm stops, one can still write down the $L$ and $U$ obtained so far, and they will satisfy $A=LU$. The remaining entries of L ($L_{ik}$ for $k \\ge 3$) are not touched by the algorithm, so they would remain as in the identity matrix.\nSo, if we follow the algorithm strictly, the final $L$ would be:\n$L = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n3 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n4 & 3 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n5 & 4 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n6 & 5 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}$\nAnd the final $U$ is the one I calculated, $A^{(2)}$. Let's call it $U_{final}$.\n$U_{final} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n0 & -1 & -2 & -3 & -4 & -5 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}$\nLet's check if $A = L U_{final}$ with this $L$.\nLet's check row 4 of the product: $(LU_{final})_4 = [4, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0] \\cdot U_{final}$.\n$(LU_{final})_{4j} = 4 U_{1j} + 3 U_{2j} + 0 \\cdot U_{3j} + 1 \\cdot U_{4j}$.\nSince $U_{3j}=U_{4j}=...=0$.\n$(LU_{final})_{4j} = 4 U_{1j} + 3 U_{2j}$.\n$U_{1j} = j$. $U_{2j} = 1-j$ for $j \\ge 2$ and $U_{21}=0$.\n$(LU_{final})_{41} = 4 U_{11} + 3 U_{21} = 4 \\cdot 1 + 3 \\cdot 0 = 4$. Correct. $A_{41}=4$.\n$(LU_{final})_{42} = 4 U_{12} + 3 U_{22} = 4 \\cdot 2 + 3 \\cdot (-1) = 8-3=5$. Correct. $A_{42}=5$.\n$(LU_{final})_{43} = 4 U_{13} + 3 U_{23} = 4 \\cdot 3 + 3 \\cdot (-2) = 12-6=6$. Correct. $A_{43}=6$.\n$(LU_{final})_{4j} = 4j + 3(1-j) = 4j+3-3j = j+3$.\nOriginal $A_{4j} = 4+j-1 = j+3$. It works.\n\nSo the LU factorization produced by the standard algorithm (that stops when a zero pivot is encountered) is:\n$L = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n3 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n4 & 3 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n5 & 4 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n6 & 5 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}$, $U = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n0 & -1 & -2 & -3 & -4 & -5 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}$.\nSeems the ambiguity of $L$ is resolved by sticking to the definition of the algorithm. The algorithm modifies $L$ column by column. If it stops at column $k-1$, columns $k, ..., n-1$ of $L$ are not modified and remain as they were in the identity matrix.\n\nSo, the problem seems valid. It has a definite result based on a standard algorithm. It is not ill-posed unless the phrase \"the LU factorization\" is interpreted as requiring uniqueness, which is not usually the case for singular matrices. Given the context of \"using the algorithm of Gaussian elimination\", it refers to the specific output of that algorithm.\n\n**Recap of validation:**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** Yes, it's a standard linear algebra problem.\n- **Well-Posed:** Yes, following the prescribed algorithm leads to a specific $L$ and $U$. The fact that the matrix is singular and the factorization might not be unique in general is handled by the specific instruction to use Gaussian elimination, which makes the outcome deterministic.

Perform Gaussian Elimination to find U and L**\nWe seek $A=LU$, where $L$ is unit lower triangular and $U$ is upper triangular. The process of Gaussian elimination transforms $A$ into $U$ via a sequence of row operations, and the multipliers used form the entries of $L$.\n\n**Step 1 of elimination (Column 1):**\nThe pivot is $A_{11}=1$.

The Gaussian elimination process without pivoting stops here.\n\n**3. Construct the L matrix**\nThe matrix $L$ is a unit lower triangular matrix whose off-diagonal entries $L_{ij}$ for $i > j$ are the multipliers $l_{ij}$ computed during elimination.\nFrom step 1, we have $l_{21}=2, l_{31}=3, l_{41}=4, l_{51}=5, l_{61}=6$.\nFrom step 2, we have $l_{32}=2, l_{42}=3, l_{52}=4, l_{62}=5$.\nSince the elimination process stopped after step 2, no more multipliers are computed. The remaining sub-diagonal entries of $L$ correspond to those of the identity matrix.\nSo, $L$ is:\n$L = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\nl_{21} & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\nl_{31} & l_{32} & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\nl_{41} & l_{42} & l_{43} & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\nl_{51} & l_{52} & l_{53} & l_{54} & 1 & 0 \\\\\nl_{61} & l_{62} & l_{63} & l_{64} & l_{65} & 1\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n3 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n4 & 3 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n5 & 4 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n6 & 5 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}$\nThis construction is based on interpreting \"using the algorithm of Gaussian elimination\" as a step-by-step procedure that modifies an initial $L=I$.\n\nThe LU factorization is thus given by the matrices $L$ and $U$ derived above. The question primarily asks to *use this derivation* to compute the determinant.\n\n**4. Compute the Determinant**\nThe determinant of a product of matrices is the product of their determinants: $\\det(A) = \\det(LU) = \\det(L)\\det(U)$.\n\nThe determinant of a triangular matrix (either lower or upper) is the product of its diagonal entries.\nFor the unit lower triangular matrix $L$, all diagonal entries are $1$.\nSo, $\\det(L) = L_{11} \\cdot L_{22} \\cdot L_{33} \\cdot L_{44} \\cdot L_{55} \\cdot L_{66} = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n\nFor the upper triangular matrix $U$, the diagonal entries are $U_{11}=1$, $U_{22}=-1$, and $U_{33}=U_{44}=U_{55}=U_{66}=0$.\nSo, $\\det(U) = U_{11} \\cdot U_{22} \\cdot U_{33} \\cdot U_{44} \\cdot U_{55} \\cdot U_{66} = 1 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot 0 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the determinant of $A$ is:\n$\\det(A) = \\det(L) \\cdot \\det(U) = 1 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n\nThis result indicates that the matrix $A$ is singular, which is consistent with the fact that its rows are linearly dependent. Specifically, for any row $i \\ge 3$, it holds that $R_i = (i-2)R_2 - (i-3)R_1$, which can be verified from the original matrix A.

The LU decomposition of $A$ can only be used to solve systems involving the matrix $A$. To solve $(A^k) x = b$, one needs the LU decomposition of the matrix $A^k$.

The new system $(A + \\delta I)x=b$ is solved, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\n- **Shift Calculation**: The shift $\\delta$ must be the smallest uniform value that makes the perturbed matrix $A_\\delta = A + \\delta I$ strictly diagonally dominant by rows.\n- **Strict Diagonal Dominance (SDD)**: For every row $i$, the magnitude of the diagonal element is greater than the sum of the magnitudes of the off-diagonal elements. For a tridiagonal matrix, this means:\n    - Row 0: $|d_0| > |c_0|$\n    - Rows $1 \\le i \\le n-2$: $|d_i| > |a_{i-1}| + |c_i|$\n    - Row $n-1$: $|d_{n-1}| > |a_{n-2}|$\n- **Test Suite**: Four specific test cases are provided, each with values for $n, a, d, c, b$.\n- **Output Format**: A single line containing a list of the four solution vectors, formatted as a string `[[...],[...],...]` with no spaces.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on fundamental concepts in numerical linear algebra, including the Thomas algorithm for tridiagonal systems and the property of strict diagonal dominance. These are standard, well-established topics. The procedure is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. The Thomas algorithm, when successful, yields a unique solution for a non-singular matrix. Strict diagonal dominance guarantees non-singularity and that all pivots in Gaussian elimination (without row interchanges) will be non-zero. The recovery procedure therefore transforms a potentially singular or unstable system into one that is guaranteed to be solvable by the specified method. The instructions for calculating the minimal shift $\\delta$ lead to a deterministic outcome.\n3.  **Objective**: All definitions and conditions are expressed in precise mathematical terms. The failure tolerance ($10^{-14}$) is explicit. The test cases are defined with exact numerical data. There is no subjective or ambiguous language.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. It provides all necessary definitions, data, and procedural steps. There are no contradictions in the setup. The requirement to find the \"smallest\" shift $\\delta$ is interpreted as the shift with the minimum absolute value, which is a standard interpretation in such optimization contexts.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a well-defined, scientifically grounded problem in numerical methods. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Design\nThe solution involves two main components: the Thomas algorithm for solving a tridiagonal system and a procedure to compute a diagonal shift to enforce strict diagonal dominance if the algorithm fails.\n\n**1. The Thomas Algorithm**\nThe Thomas algorithm solves the system $A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}$ by first transforming it into an upper triangular system of the form $U\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}'$ and then solving for $\\mathbf{x}$ via back substitution. This is achieved in two stages:\n\n**Forward Elimination**: The matrix is transformed by eliminating the subdiagonal elements. We compute modified superdiagonal coefficients $c'_i$ and a modified right-hand side vector $b'_i$.\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\nLet's denote the original vectors as $a, d, c, b$. We will compute modified vectors $c^*$ (of size $n-1$) and $b^*$ (of size $n$).\nThe first pivot is $p_0 = d_0$. If $|p_0| < 10^{-14}$, the algorithm fails. Otherwise:\n$$ c^*_0 = \\frac{c_0}{d_0} $$\n$$ b^*_0 = \\frac{b_0}{d_0} $$\nFor $i = 1, 2, \\dots, n-1$, we compute the subsequent pivots and coefficients:\nThe pivot at step $i$ is $p_i = d_i - a_{i-1} c^*_{i-1}$. If $|p_i| < 10^{-14}$, the algorithm fails. Otherwise:\nFor $i = 1, \\dots, n-2$:\n$$ c^*_i = \\frac{c_i}{d_i - a_{i-1} c^*_{i-1}} $$\nAnd for $i = 1, \\dots, n-1$:\n$$ b^*_i = \\frac{b_i - a_{i-1} b^*_{i-1}}{d_i - a_{i-1} c^*_{i-1}} $$\nNote that the terms $c^*_{n-1}$ and $a_{n-1}$ are not defined, which is consistent with the matrix dimensions.\n\n**Backward Substitution**: After the forward elimination, the system is equivalent to $x_i + c^*_i x_{i+1} = b^*_i$ for $i < n-1$ and $x_{n-1} = b^*_{n-1}$. The solution vector $\\mathbf{x}$ is found by back substitution:\n$$ x_{n-1} = b^*_{n-1} $$\nFor $i = n-2, n-3, \\dots, 0$:\n$$ x_i = b^*_i - c^*_i x_{i+1} $$\n\n**2. Minimal Uniform Diagonal Shift for Strict Diagonal Dominance**\nIf the Thomas algorithm fails due to a near-zero pivot, we must find the smallest (in magnitude) uniform shift $\\delta$ such that the new matrix $A_\\delta = A + \\delta I$ is strictly diagonally dominant (SDD). The new diagonal is $d'_i = d_i + \\delta$.\n\nThe conditions for SDD on $A_\\delta$ are $|d_i + \\delta| > S_i$ for all rows $i=0, \\dots, n-1$, where $S_i$ is the sum of absolute values of the off-diagonal elements in row $i$:\n$$ S_0 = |c_0| $$\n$$ S_i = |a_{i-1}| + |c_i| \\quad \\text{for } 1 \\le i \\le n-2 $$\n$$ S_{n-1} = |a_{n-2}| $$\nEach inequality $|d_i + \\delta| > S_i$ is equivalent to $\\delta > S_i - d_i$ or $\\delta < -S_i - d_i$. To satisfy this for all $i$, $\\delta$ must lie in the set $(-\\infty, \\delta_{\\text{low}}) \\cup (\\delta_{\\text{up}}, \\infty)$, where:\n$$ \\delta_{\\text{up}} = \\max_{i} (S_i - d_i) $$\n$$ \\delta_{\\text{low}} = \\min_{i} (-S_i - d_i) $$\nWe seek the value in this set with the minimum absolute value. Since the original matrix is not SDD (otherwise the algorithm would not have failed, assuming it started from a non-singular matrix), $\\delta=0$ is not a solution. Thus, the candidates for the minimal magnitude shift are values infinitesimally greater than $\\delta_{\\text{up}}$ or infinitesimally less than $\\delta_{\\text{low}}$.\nLet $\\epsilon$ be a small positive constant to ensure strict inequality. A reasonable choice, given the problem's context, is $\\epsilon = 10^{-14}$. The candidate shifts are:\n$$ \\delta_1 = \\delta_{\\text{up}} + \\epsilon $$\n$$ \\delta_2 = \\delta_{\\text{low}} - \\epsilon $$\nThe selected shift $\\delta$ is the one with the smaller magnitude:\n$$ \\delta = \\begin{cases} \\delta_1 & \\text{if } |\\delta_1| \\le |\\delta_2| \\\\ \\delta_2 & \\text{if } |\\delta_1| > |\\delta_2| \\end{cases} $$\nWith this $\\delta$, we form the new diagonal vector $d' = d + \\delta$ and re-solve the system $(A+\\delta I)\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}$ using the Thomas algorithm. This second attempt is guaranteed to succeed.\n\n**3. Implementation Strategy**\nA primary function will iterate through the test cases. For each case, a solver function is called. This solver first attempts to solve the system with the original matrix using the Thomas algorithm. If it detects a failure (returns a null value), it computes the minimal diagonal shift $\\delta$, applies it to the diagonal, and calls the Thomas algorithm again on the perturbed system.
