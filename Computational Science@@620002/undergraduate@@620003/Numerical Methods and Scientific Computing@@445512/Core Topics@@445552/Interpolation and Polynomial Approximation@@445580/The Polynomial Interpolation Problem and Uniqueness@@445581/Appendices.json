According to the principle that \"if two polynomials of degree at most $n$ agree at $n+1$ distinct points, then they are identical\", it follows that $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ must be the same polynomial.

Since $q(x)$ has roots at each of the $n+1$ distinct nodes $x_0, \\dots, x_n$, it must be divisible by the product of the corresponding factors.\nThus, $q(x)$ can be written in the form:\n$$q(x) = C \\cdot (x-x_{0})(x-x_{1})\\cdots(x-x_{n})$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant.

Rearranging the equation gives:\n$$f(x_{n+1}) - p_{n}(x_{n+1}) = C \\prod_{k=0}^{n} (x_{n+1}-x_{k})$$\nSince the node $x_{n+1}$ is distinct from all previous nodes $x_{0}, \\dots, x_{n}$, each term $(x_{n+1}-x_{k})$ is non-zero.
