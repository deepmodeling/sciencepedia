Its strategy involves using the slope at the midpoint of a time step, estimated using an initial Euler step, to make a more accurate projection across the entire interval. This practice problem provides a direct application of the midpoint method formula, allowing you to build foundational skills in executing RK2 algorithms for a standard initial value problem.", "problem": "Consider the initial value problem defined by the differential equation $y'(t) = \\cos(t) - y(t) + t^2$ with the initial condition $y(0) = 2$. Your task is to approximate the value of $y(0.2)$ using a single step of the midpoint method, which is a second-order Runge-Kutta (RK2) method. Use a step size of $h=0.2$. The formula for the midpoint method is given by $y_{n+1} = y_n + h k_2$, where $k_1 = f(t_n, y_n)$ and $k_2 = f(t_n + \\frac{h}{2}, y_n + \\frac{h}{2}k_1)$.
