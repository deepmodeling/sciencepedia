No rounding is required.", "solution": "### Part 1: Derivation of the Fourth-Order Taylor Method\nThe foundation of Taylor series methods is the Taylor expansion of the solution $y(t)$ about a point $t_{n}$. The expansion is given by:\n$$y(t) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(t-t_{n})^{k}}{k!} y^{(k)}(t_{n})$$\nwhere $y^{(k)}(t_{n})$ is the $k$-th derivative of $y$ evaluated at $t_{n}$. We wish to find the value of the solution at $t = t_{n+1} = t_{n} + h$. Substituting this into the series gives:\n$$y(t_{n+1}) = y(t_{n}) + (t_{n+1}-t_{n})y^{(1)}(t_{n}) + \\frac{(t_{n+1}-t_{n})^{2}}{2!}y^{(2)}(t_{n}) + \\frac{(t_{n+1}-t_{n})^{3}}{3!}y^{(3)}(t_{n}) + \\frac{(t_{n+1}-t_{n})^{4}}{4!}y^{(4)}(t_{n}) + \\dots$$\nUsing $t_{n+1} - t_{n} = h$, the exact solution $y(t_{n+1})$ is:\n$$y(t_{n+1}) = y(t_{n}) + h y^{(1)}(t_{n}) + \\frac{h^{2}}{2} y^{(2)}(t_{n}) + \\frac{h^{3}}{6} y^{(3)}(t_{n}) + \\frac{h^{4}}{24} y^{(4)}(t_{n}) + O(h^{5})$$\nA numerical method of order $p$ is created by truncating this series after the term of order $h^{p}$. The fourth-order Taylor one-step method is thus obtained by truncating the series after the $h^{4}$ term. Let $y_{n}$ be the numerical approximation to $y(t_{n})$. The method gives the next approximation $y_{n+1}$ as:\n$$y_{n+1} = y_{n} + h y^{(1)}(t_{n}) + \\frac{h^{2}}{2} y^{(2)}(t_{n}) + \\frac{h^{3}}{6} y^{(3)}(t_{n}) + \\frac{h^{4}}{24} y^{(4)}(t_{n})$$\nHere, the derivatives $y^{(k)}(t_{n})$ are obtained by differentiating the ODE's right-hand side function, $f(t,y) = \\frac{dy}{dt}$. In this problem, $f$ only depends on $t$, so $y^{(1)}(t_{n}) = f(t_{n})$, $y^{(2)}(t_{n}) = f'(t_{n})$, and so on.\n\n### Part 2: Derivatives and Local Truncation Error\nFor the given ODE, $\\frac{dy}{dt} = 6t^{3} - 2t$, the derivatives of $y(t)$ are found by successive differentiation with respect to $t$.\nThe first derivative is given by the ODE itself:\n$$y^{(1)}(t) = 6t^{3} - 2t$$\nThe next three derivatives are:\n$$y^{(2)}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(6t^{3} - 2t) = 18t^{2} - 2$$\n$$y^{(3)}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(18t^{2} - 2) = 36t$$\n$$y^{(4)}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(36t) = 36$$\nTo analyze the local truncation error, we must examine the term that was truncated from the Taylor series. The local error of the fourth-order method, assuming the method starts from the exact value $y(t_n)$, is given by the remainder term of the Taylor expansion:\n$$E_{n+1} = y(t_{n+1}) - y_{n+1} = \\frac{h^{5}}{5!}y^{(5)}(t_{n}) + \\frac{h^{6}}{6!}y^{(6)}(t_{n}) + \\dots$$\nThe local truncation error (LTE) is defined as $T_{n+1} = \\frac{E_{n+1}}{h}$, so its leading term is of order $h^{4}$.\nLet's compute the fifth derivative of $y(t)$:\n$$y^{(5)}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(36) = 0$$\nSince $y^{(5)}(t)$ is identically zero for all $t$, all higher derivatives are also identically zero: $y^{(k)}(t) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 5$.\nThis has a critical consequence for the Taylor series. The remainder term, which involves derivatives of order $5$ and higher, is identically zero. Therefore, the Taylor expansion of $y(t)$ terminates exactly after the fourth-order term.\n$$y(t_{n+1}) = y(t_{n}) + h y^{(1)}(t_{n}) + \\frac{h^{2}}{2} y^{(2)}(t_{n}) + \\frac{h^{3}}{6} y^{(3)}(t_{n}) + \\frac{h^{4}}{24} y^{(4)}(t_{n})$$\nThis is an exact identity. The formula for the fourth-order Taylor method is precisely the right-hand side of this identity. If we assume $y_{n} = y(t_{n})$, then the value computed by the method, $y_{n+1}$, is exactly equal to the true solution $y(t_{n+1})$.\nThe single-step error $E_{n+1} = y(t_{n+1}) - y_{n+1}$ is therefore $0$. Consequently, the local truncation error $T_{n+1} = E_{n+1}/h$ is also identically zero for any step size $h$. This is because the true solution to the ODE is a polynomial of degree $4$, and a Taylor method of order $4$ provides an exact representation for any polynomial of degree up to $4$.\n\n### Part 3: Computation of y(1)\nWe are asked to compute $y(1)$ using a single step of the fourth-order Taylor method, starting from $t_{0} = 0$. This means we set $n=0$, $t_{0}=0$, $y_{0}=0$, and $h = t_{1} - t_{0} = 1 - 0 = 1$.\nThe formula for $y_{1}$ is:\n$$y_{1} = y_{0} + h y^{(1)}(t_{0}) + \\frac{h^{2}}{2} y^{(2)}(t_{0}) + \\frac{h^{3}}{6} y^{(3)}(t_{0}) + \\frac{h^{4}}{24} y^{(4)}(t_{0})$$\nWe need to evaluate the derivatives at $t_{0} = 0$:\n$$y^{(1)}(0) = 6(0)^{3} - 2(0) = 0$$\n$$y^{(2)}(0) = 18(0)^{2} - 2 = -2$$\n$$y^{(3)}(0) = 36(0) = 0$$\n$$y^{(4)}(0) = 36$$\nSubstituting these values along with $y_{0}=0$ and $h=1$ into the method's formula:\n$$y_{1} = 0 + (1)(0) + \\frac{(1)^{2}}{2}(-2) + \\frac{(1)^{3}}{6}(0) + \\frac{(1)^{4}}{24}(36)$$\n$$y_{1} = 0 + 0 + \\frac{1}{2}(-2) + 0 + \\frac{36}{24}$$\n$$y_{1} = -1 + \\frac{3}{2}$$\n$$y_{1} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe computed value for $y(1)$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.
