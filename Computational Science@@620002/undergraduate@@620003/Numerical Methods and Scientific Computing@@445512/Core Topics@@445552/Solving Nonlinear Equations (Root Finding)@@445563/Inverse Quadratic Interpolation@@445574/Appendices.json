A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe goal is to find the next iterate, $x_3$, of the Inverse Quadratic Interpolation (IQI) method for the root of $f(x) = \\mathrm{sign}(x)\\sqrt{|x|}$, starting with $x_0 = -1$, $x_1 = 2$, and $x_2 = 3$.\n\nThe IQI method models the inverse function, $x = f^{-1}(y)$, with a quadratic polynomial. We are given three points on the graph of $f(x)$: $(x_0, y_0)$, $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$. For the inverse function, these correspond to the points $(y_0, x_0)$, $(y_1, x_1)$, and $(y_2, x_2)$. The data points for the inverse interpolation are:\n- Point $0$: $(y_0, x_0) = (-1, -1)$\n- Point $1$: $(y_1, x_1) = (\\sqrt{2}, 2)$\n- Point $2$: $(y_2, x_2) = (\\sqrt{3}, 3)$\n\nThe problem requires constructing the interpolating polynomial $\\widehat{x}(y)$ from fundamental principles. We will use the Lagrange form of the interpolating polynomial, which expresses the unique quadratic passing through these three points as:\n$$ \\widehat{x}(y) = x_0 L_0(y) + x_1 L_1(y) + x_2 L_2(y) $$\nwhere $L_0(y)$, $L_1(y)$, and $L_2(y)$ are the Lagrange basis polynomials:\n$$ L_0(y) = \\frac{(y - y_1)(y - y_2)}{(y_0 - y_1)(y_0 - y_2)}, \\quad L_1(y) = \\frac{(y - y_0)(y - y_2)}{(y_1 - y_0)(y_1 - y_2)}, \\quad L_2(y) = \\frac{(y - y_0)(y - y_1)}{(y_2 - y_0)(y_2 - y_1)} $$\nThe next IQI iterate, $x_3$, is the new approximation of the root, which is found by evaluating the inverse interpolant at $y=0$ (since the root $x$ satisfies $f(x)=0$, which implies $x = f^{-1}(0)$).\n$$ x_3 = \\widehat{x}(0) = x_0 L_0(0) + x_1 L_1(0) + x_2 L_2(0) $$\nWe evaluate the basis polynomials at $y=0$:\n$$ L_0(0) = \\frac{y_1 y_2}{(y_0 - y_1)(y_0 - y_2)} $$\n$$ L_1(0) = \\frac{y_0 y_2}{(y_1 - y_0)(y_1 - y_2)} $$\n$$ L_2(0) = \\frac{y_0 y_1}{(y_2 - y_0)(y_2 - y_1)} $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $x_3$ yields the general formula for the IQI update:\n$$ x_3 = x_0 \\frac{y_1 y_2}{(y_0 - y_1)(y_0 - y_2)} + x_1 \\frac{y_0 y_2}{(y_1 - y_0)(y_1 - y_2)} + x_2 \\frac{y_0 y_1}{(y_2 - y_0)(y_2 - y_1)} $$\nNow, we substitute the specified values: $x_0 = -1$, $x_1 = 2$, $x_2 = 3$ and $y_0 = -1$, $y_1 = \\sqrt{2}$, $y_2 = \\sqrt{3}$.\n$$ x_3 = (-1) \\frac{(\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{3})}{(-1 - \\sqrt{2})(-1 - \\sqrt{3})} + (2) \\frac{(-1)(\\sqrt{3})}{(\\sqrt{2} - (-1))(\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3})} + (3) \\frac{(-1)(\\sqrt{2})}{(\\sqrt{3} - (-1))(\\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{2})} $$\n$$ x_3 = - \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{(1 + \\sqrt{2})(1 + \\sqrt{3})} - \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{(\\sqrt{2} + 1)(\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3})} - \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{(\\sqrt{3} + 1)(\\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{2})} $$\nTo simplify, we can rewrite the expression with positive denominators to make the signs clearer:\n$$ x_3 = - \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{(1 + \\sqrt{2})(1 + \\sqrt{3})} + \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{(\\sqrt{2} + 1)(\\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{2})} + \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{(\\sqrt{3} + 1)(\\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{2})} $$\nWe place the terms over a common denominator $D = (1 + \\sqrt{2})(1 + \\sqrt{3})(\\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{2})$:\n$$ D = (1+\\sqrt{2})(1+\\sqrt{3})(\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{2}) = (1+\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{3}-2+3-\\sqrt{6}) = (1+\\sqrt{2})(1+\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{6}) = 1+\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{12} = 1+\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}-2\\sqrt{3} = 1+\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{3} $$\nLet's re-calculate the common denominator another way, matching the original solution's grouping: $D = (1+\\sqrt{2})(1+\\sqrt{3})(\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{3})$.\n$D = (1+\\sqrt{2}) \\left( \\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{6}-3 \\right) = (\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{6}-3) + (2-\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{12}-3\\sqrt{2}) = \\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{6}-3+2-\\sqrt{6}+2\\sqrt{3}-3\\sqrt{2} = -1-2\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}$. This matches the original.\nThe numerator $N$ is:\n$$ N = -\\sqrt{6}(\\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{2}) + 2\\sqrt{3}(1+\\sqrt{3}) + 3\\sqrt{2}(1+\\sqrt{2}) $$\n$$ N = (-\\sqrt{18} + \\sqrt{12}) + (2\\sqrt{3} + 6) + (3\\sqrt{2} + 6) $$\n$$ N = -3\\sqrt{2} + 2\\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{3} + 6 + 3\\sqrt{2} + 6 = 12 + 4\\sqrt{3} $$\nThis seems different from the original solution.

OK. $2\\sqrt{3}(1+\\sqrt{3}) = 2\\sqrt{3}+6$.\nMy last term: $\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{(\\sqrt{3}+1)(\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{2})}$. Multiplied by $(1+\\sqrt{2})$. OK. $3\\sqrt{2}(1+\\sqrt{2}) = 3\\sqrt{2}+6$.\nMy first term: $-\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{(1+\\sqrt{2})(1+\\sqrt{3})}$. Multiplied by $(\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{2})$. OK. $-\\sqrt{6}(\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{2}) = -\\sqrt{18}+\\sqrt{12} = -3\\sqrt{2}+2\\sqrt{3}$.\nSo $N = (-3\\sqrt{2}+2\\sqrt{3}) + (2\\sqrt{3}+6) + (3\\sqrt{2}+6) = 12+4\\sqrt{3}$. The original solution's $N$ was $6\\sqrt{2}-4\\sqrt{3}$. There is a calculation error in one of the solutions.\n\nLet's re-check the original solution's numerator calculation.\n$N = -\\sqrt{6}(\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3}) - 2\\sqrt{3}(1+\\sqrt{3}) + 3\\sqrt{2}(1+\\sqrt{2})$\nThis seems to come from an initial expression of $x_3 = - \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{(1+\\sqrt{2})(1+\\sqrt{3})} - \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{(1+\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{3})} + \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{(1+\\sqrt{3})(\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{3})}$.\nLet's check the signs in the Lagrange formula:\n$L_0(0) = \\frac{y_1 y_2}{(y_0 - y_1)(y_0 - y_2)}$ -> Pos.\n$L_1(0) = \\frac{y_0 y_2}{(y_1 - y_0)(y_1 - y_2)}$ -> Neg.\n$L_2(0) = \\frac{y_0 y_1}{(y_2 - y_0)(y_2 - y_1)}$ -> Neg.\n$x_3 = x_0 L_0(0) + x_1 L_1(0) + x_2 L_2(0) = (-1)(\\text{Pos}) + (2)(\\text{Neg}) + (3)(\\text{Neg})$. All three terms are negative.\nSo, the initial expression should be: $x_3 = - \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{(1 + \\sqrt{2})(1 + \\sqrt{3})} - \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{(\\sqrt{2} + 1)(\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{2})} - \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{(\\sqrt{3} + 1)(\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{3})}$\nThe original provided solution's calculation chain is correct from its starting formula, but the starting formula itself had sign errors. The final answer, however, is correct. This is a known issue where an error in an intermediate step is corrected, leading to the right answer. We will correct the derivation to be sound from start to finish.\n\nCorrect derivation:\n$$ x_3 = - \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{(1 + \\sqrt{2})(1 + \\sqrt{3})} - \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{(\\sqrt{2} + 1)(-\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{2})} - \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{(\\sqrt{3} + 1)(-\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3})} $$\n$$ x_3 = - \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{(1+\\sqrt{2})(1+\\sqrt{3})} + \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{(1+\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{2})} - \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{(1+\\sqrt{3})(\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{2})} $$\nCommon Denominator $D = (1+\\sqrt{2})(1+\\sqrt{3})(\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{2}) = 1+\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{3}$.\nNumerator $N = -\\sqrt{6}(\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{2}) + 2\\sqrt{3}(1+\\sqrt{3}) - 3\\sqrt{2}(1+\\sqrt{2})$\n$N = (-\\sqrt{18}+\\sqrt{12}) + (2\\sqrt{3}+6) - (3\\sqrt{2}+6)$\n$N = -3\\sqrt{2} + 2\\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{3} + 6 - 3\\sqrt{2} - 6 = -6\\sqrt{2} + 4\\sqrt{3}$\nSo, $x_3 = \\frac{-6\\sqrt{2} + 4\\sqrt{3}}{1+\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{3}}$.\nLet's rationalize.

The goal is to construct and compare two derivative-free solvers for this equation: inverse quadratic interpolation and fixed-point iteration.\n\nYou must derive and implement the following two iterative methods from first principles, starting from core definitions of interpolation and fixed-point iteration:\n\n1. Inverse quadratic interpolation (IQI): Given three distinct iterates $x_0$, $x_1$, and $x_2$ with associated function values $f(x_0)$, $f(x_1)$, and $f(x_2)$, build the unique quadratic polynomial in the variable $y$ that interpolates the inverse relation, namely a polynomial $Q(y)$ such that $Q(f(x_i))=x_i$ for $i\\in\\{0,1,2\\}$. Use this interpolant to produce the next iterate by evaluating at $y=0$, i.e., $x_{\\text{new}}=Q(0)$. To avoid numerical instability when the construction is ill-conditioned (for example, when any pair of $f(x_i)$ values are nearly equal so that denominators in the interpolation become tiny), your implementation must detect such cases and fall back to a secant update computed from the two most recent iterates, provided their function values are sufficiently different. If even that is not possible because of near-equal function values, you must retain the current iterate unchanged for that step.\n\n2. Fixed-point iteration: Rewrite the equation in fixed-point form $x=g(x)$ with $g(x)=\\exp(-x)$. Starting from an initial guess $x_0$, iterate $x_{k+1}=g(x_k)$ until convergence. This is a derivative-free method that uses only function evaluation of $g(x)$.\n\nFor both methods, use the same convergence logic. Define an absolute function tolerance $\\varepsilon_f=10^{-12}$ and a step tolerance $\\varepsilon_x=10^{-12}$. An iterate $x_k$ is accepted as converged if either $|f(x_k)|\\le \\varepsilon_f$ or $|x_k-x_{k-1}|\\le \\varepsilon_x$ (for $k\\ge 1$). Impose a maximum of $N_{\\max}=1000$ iterations. Count the number of iterations actually performed until the stopping criterion is first met; if the maximum is reached without meeting the criterion, report the last iterate and the iteration count $N_{\\max}$.\n\nYour program must implement both solvers and apply them to the test suite below. For each test case, run IQI using the specified three initial points $(x_0,x_1,x_2)$ and fixed-point iteration using the specified initial point $x_0$. For each method and each test case, return the final approximate root and the number of iterations taken.\n\nTest suite:\n- Case $1$: IQI with $(x_0,x_1,x_2)=(0.0,1.0,0.5)$ and fixed-point with $x_0=0.0$.\n- Case $2$: IQI with $(x_0,x_1,x_2)=(0.55,0.57,0.60)$ and fixed-point with $x_0=0.55$.\n- Case $3$: IQI with $(x_0,x_1,x_2)=(-2.0,2.0,3.0)$ and fixed-point with $x_0=3.0$.\n- Case $4$: IQI with $(x_0,x_1,x_2)=(0.56,0.565,0.57)$ and fixed-point with $x_0=0.56$.\n\nYour program must produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets.

It is a continuous and differentiable function for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Its derivative is $f'(x) = 1 + e^{-x}$. Since $e^{-x} > 0$ for all real $x$, we have $f'(x) > 1$, which means $f(x)$ is strictly monotonically increasing. Furthermore, $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$ and $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = +\\infty$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a unique real root $\\alpha$ such that $f(\\alpha)=0$. This root is the solution to $\\alpha = e^{-\\alpha}$, which is given by the Lambert W function, $\\alpha = W(1) \\approx 0.56714329041$.\n\n### **Method 1: Inverse Quadratic Interpolation (IQI)**\n\n#### **Derivation from First Principles**\nInverse quadratic interpolation is a root-finding algorithm that uses three previous iterates to form a quadratic model of the *inverse* function and then uses this model to estimate the root. Let the three distinct points be $(x_0, y_0)$, $(x_1, y_1)$, and $(x_2, y_2)$, where $y_i = f(x_i)$. We seek a quadratic polynomial $Q(y)$ such that $Q(y_i) = x_i$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. This is a standard interpolation problem. The unique quadratic interpolant can be expressed using the Lagrange basis polynomials:\n$$\nQ(y) = x_0 \\frac{(y-y_1)(y-y_2)}{(y_0-y_1)(y_0-y_2)} + x_1 \\frac{(y-y_0)(y-y_2)}{(y_1-y_0)(y_1-y_2)} + x_2 \\frac{(y-y_0)(y-y_1)}{(y_2-y_0)(y_2-y_1)}\n$$\nThe root of the original function $f(x)$ corresponds to the value of its inverse $x=f^{-1}(y)$ at $y=0$. We approximate this value by evaluating our interpolant $Q(y)$ at $y=0$. This gives the next iterate, $x_{\\text{new}}$:\n$$\nx_{\\text{new}} = Q(0) = x_0 \\frac{(-y_1)(-y_2)}{(y_0-y_1)(y_0-y_2)} + x_1 \\frac{(-y_0)(-y_2)}{(y_1-y_0)(y_1-y_2)} + x_2 \\frac{(-y_0)(-y_1)}{(y_2-y_0)(y_2-y_1)}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the update formula for IQI:\n$$\nx_{\\text{new}} = x_0 \\frac{y_1 y_2}{(y_0-y_1)(y_0-y_2)} + x_1 \\frac{y_0 y_2}{(y_1-y_0)(y_1-y_2)} + x_2 \\frac{y_0 y_1}{(y_2-y_0)(y_2-y_1)}\n$$\nThis formula requires that the function values $y_0, y_1, y_2$ be distinct, otherwise the denominators become zero.\n\n#### **Algorithmic Design and Fallback Strategy**\nThe iterative process starts with three initial points $(x_a, x_b, x_c)$ and their function values $(y_a, y_b, y_c)$. In each iteration, a new point $x_{\\text{new}}$ is computed, and the oldest point is discarded. The set of points for the next iteration becomes $(x_b, x_c, x_{\\text{new}})$.\n\nA crucial part of a robust IQI implementation is handling cases where the method is ill-conditioned, which occurs when any two of the function values $(y_a, y_b, y_c)$ are nearly equal. The problem specifies a fallback strategy:\n1.  **Attempt IQI:** Calculate $x_{\\text{new}}$ using the formula above. This is only done if the function values $y_a$, $y_b$, and $y_c$ are sufficiently distinct. Numerically, we check if $|y_i - y_j|$ is greater than a small tolerance for all $i \\neq j$.\n2.  **Fallback to Secant Method:** If the IQI update is unstable (i.e., function values are not distinct), the algorithm falls back to the secant method using the two most recent points, $(x_b, y_b)$ and $(x_c, y_c)$. The secant formula for the next iterate is:\n    $$\n    x_{\\text{new}} = x_c - y_c \\frac{x_c - x_b}{y_c - y_b}\n    $$\n    This is only performed if $y_c$ and $y_b$ are sufficiently distinct.\n3.  **Second Fallback (Retain Iterate):** If both IQI and the secant method are unstable (because $y_b \\approx y_c$), the algorithm does not compute a new point and simply carries the most recent iterate forward: $x_{\\text{new}} = x_c$. This prevents division by a near-zero number and maintains stability.\n\n### **Method 2: Fixed-Point Iteration**\n\n#### **Derivation from First Principles**\nFixed-point iteration is a method for finding roots of an equation $f(x)=0$ by rearranging it into the form $x=g(x)$. A solution to this equation is a \"fixed point\" of the function $g$. Given an initial guess $x_0$, the method generates a sequence of iterates using the recurrence relation $x_{k+1} = g(x_k)$.\n\nFor the given equation, $f(x) = x - e^{-x} = 0$, a natural rearrangement is:\n$$\nx = e^{-x}\n$$\nThis gives the iteration function $g(x) = e^{-x}$. The iterative scheme is therefore:\n$$\nx_{k+1} = g(x_k) = \\exp(-x_k)\n$$\nThe convergence of this method is governed by the Contraction Mapping Theorem. The iteration is guaranteed to converge to the unique fixed point in an interval if $|g'(x)|  1$ for all $x$ in that interval. For our problem, $g'(x) = -e^{-x}$. The root $\\alpha \\approx 0.56714$ lies in the interval $[0, 1]$. On this interval, $|g'(x)| = e^{-x} \\le e^0 = 1$. At the root, $|g'(\\alpha)| = e^{-\\alpha} = \\alpha  1$. For any initial guess $x_0$ for which convergence criteria apply, the condition for local convergence is satisfied. For $x_0 \\ge 0$, for instance, all subsequent iterates will remain non-negative, and the method will converge to the positive root.\n\n#### **Algorithmic Design**\nThe algorithm starts with an initial value $x_0$. It then iteratively computes $x_1 = g(x_0)$, $x_2=g(x_1)$, and so on, until the stopping criterion is met.\n\n### **Convergence and Termination**\nBoth methods use the same termination criteria.

Inverse quadratic interpolation constructs a quadratic polynomial for the inverse mapping $x(f)$ based on three data pairs $(x_0,f_0)$, $(x_1,f_1)$, and $(x_2,f_2)$ where $f_i = f(x_i)$, and then evaluates this polynomial at $f=0$ to estimate the root. The foundational base for this problem is the definition of polynomial interpolation for a function represented in Lagrange or Newton form, and the fact that the Lagrange basis functions sum to unity. You must start from these well-tested facts and definitions and derive any needed working formulas yourself.\n\nYour program must implement two versions of the inverse quadratic interpolation step to compute an estimate $\\hat{x}$ of the root from $(x_0,f_0)$, $(x_1,f_1)$, and $(x_2,f_2)$:\n\n- A direct evaluation based on the standard construction of the degree-two interpolant for $x(f)$ at $f=0$, which is known to be susceptible to floating-point cancellation when the function values are very close to each other.\n\n- A rearranged evaluation that you derive from first principles, using the property that the Lagrange basis functions for $x(f)$ sum to one, so as to reduce catastrophic cancellation when combining large, nearly opposite terms.\n\nYou must demonstrate, using a scientifically sound scenario, that the standard formula can fail numerically due to floating-point cancellation, and that the rearranged formula improves numerical stability. All arithmetic is to be performed in double-precision following the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers floating-point standard (IEEE 754).\n\nImplement both versions for the following test suite. In all cases, the unknown exact root is $r=0$ and the error to report is the absolute error $|\\hat{x}-r|$ as a floating-point number:\n\n- Test case $1$ (cancellation-prone cluster near a small offset): Let $f(x)=x^3$. Choose $a=1\\times 10^{-8}$ and $h=1\\times 10^{-16}$. Set $x_0=a$, $x_1=a+h$, $x_2=a-h$, and define $f_i=f(x_i)$. This configuration makes $f_0$, $f_1$, and $f_2$ extremely close, which should trigger floating-point cancellation in the direct evaluation.\n\n- Test case $2$ (well-conditioned linear mapping): Let $f(x)=x$. Set $x_0=-1$, $x_1=0.3$, $x_2=2$, and define $f_i=f(x_i)$. This configuration should be well-behaved and produce an accurate estimate without cancellation issues.\n\n- Test case $3$ (one point near the root): Let $f(x)=x^3$. Set $x_0=-1\\times 10^{-6}$, $x_1=1\\times 10^{-6}$, $x_2=1\\times 10^{-12}$, and define $f_i=f(x_i)$. This configuration places one function value very close to zero.\n\nFor each test case, compute:\n- The absolute error of the direct evaluation, $E_{\\text{direct}}=|\\hat{x}_{\\text{direct}}-r|$.\n- The absolute error of the rearranged evaluation, $E_{\\text{rearr}}=|\\hat{x}_{\\text{rearr}}-r|$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the six floating-point results for the three test cases in order as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets:\n$[E_{\\text{direct},1},E_{\\text{rearr},1},E_{\\text{direct},2},E_{\\text{rearr},2},E_{\\text{direct},3},E_{\\text{rearr},3}]$.", "solution": "The problem requires the implementation and comparison of two formulas for a single step of inverse quadratic interpolation. The goal is to find an estimate $\\hat{x}$ for a root of a function $f(x)$, given three points $(x_0, f_0), (x_1, f_1), (x_2, f_2)$, where $f_i = f(x_i)$. The root estimate is found by constructing a quadratic polynomial $x(f)$ that passes through the three points $(f_i, x_i)$ and evaluating it at $f=0$.\n\nThe analysis will proceed in two steps:\n1.  Derivation of the two required formulas: a \"direct\" formula and a \"rearranged\" formula.\n2.  Implementation and evaluation of these formulas on the provided test cases.\n\n### Derivation of the Interpolation Formulas\n\nLet the three given data points be $(f_0, x_0)$, $(f_1, x_1)$, and $(f_2, x_2)$. We seek the value $x(0)$ of the unique quadratic polynomial $x(f)$ passing through these points.\n\n#### 1. Direct Evaluation Formula\n\nThe standard construction for an interpolating polynomial is the Lagrange form. The polynomial $x(f)$ is given by:\n$$\nx(f) = x_0 L_0(f) + x_1 L_1(f) + x_2 L_2(f)\n$$\nwhere $L_i(f)$ are the Lagrange basis polynomials:\n$$\nL_0(f) = \\frac{(f - f_1)(f - f_2)}{(f_0 - f_1)(f_0 - f_2)}, \\quad\nL_1(f) = \\frac{(f - f_0)(f - f_2)}{(f_1 - f_0)(f_1 - f_2)}, \\quad\nL_2(f) = \\frac{(f - f_0)(f - f_1)}{(f_2 - f_0)(f_2 - f_1)}\n$$\nThe root estimate, $\\hat{x}$, is obtained by evaluating $x(f)$ at $f=0$:\n$$\n\\hat{x} = x(0) = x_0 L_0(0) + x_1 L_1(0) + x_2 L_2(0)\n$$\nSubstituting $f=0$ into the basis polynomials gives:\n$$\nL_0(0) = \\frac{f_1 f_2}{(f_0 - f_1)(f_0 - f_2)}, \\quad\nL_1(0) = \\frac{f_0 f_2}{(f_1 - f_0)(f_1 - f_2)}, \\quad\nL_2(0) = \\frac{f_0 f_1}{(f_2 - f_0)(f_2 - f_1)}\n$$\nThis leads to the direct evaluation formula:\n$$\n\\hat{x}_{\\text{direct}} = x_0 \\frac{f_1 f_2}{(f_0 - f_1)(f_0 - f_2)} + x_1 \\frac{f_0 f_2}{(f_1 - f_0)(f_1 - f_2)} + x_2 \\frac{f_0 f_1}{(f_2 - f_0)(f_2 - f_1)}\n$$\nThis formula is known to be numerically unstable when the function values $f_0, f_1, f_2$ are close to each other but not close to zero. In this situation, the denominators $(f_i - f_j)$ become small, leading to large values for the individual terms. The final estimate $\\hat{x}$, which should be close to the $x_i$ values, is then computed by summing these large, nearly-canceling terms, a process known as catastrophic cancellation, which can lead to a significant loss of precision.\n\n#### 2. Rearranged Evaluation Formula\n\nThe problem states that a more stable formula can be derived using the property that the sum of the Lagrange basis polynomials is unity:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{2} L_i(f) = 1\n$$\nThis identity holds for any value of $f$, including $f=0$. We can use this to express the estimate $\\hat{x}$ as a correction to one of the initial points, say $x_2$. We write:\n$$\n\\hat{x} = x_2 + (\\hat{x} - x_2)\n$$\nUsing the sum property, we can write $x_2 = x_2 \\cdot 1 = x_2 \\sum_{i=0}^{2} L_i(0)$. Substituting this and the Lagrange formula for $\\hat{x}$:\n$$\n\\hat{x} - x_2 = \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{2} x_i L_i(0) \\right) - \\left( x_2 \\sum_{i=0}^{2} L_i(0) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{x} - x_2 = \\sum_{i=0}^{2} (x_i - x_2) L_i(0) = (x_0 - x_2)L_0(0) + (x_1 - x_2)L_1(0) + (x_2 - x_2)L_2(0)\n$$\nThe term for $i=2$ vanishes, leaving a formula for the correction term:\n$$\n\\hat{x} - x_2 = (x_0 - x_2)L_0(0) + (x_1 - x_2)L_1(0)\n$$\nThis gives the rearranged evaluation formula:\n$$\n\\hat{x}_{\\text{rearr}} = x_2 + (x_0 - x_2) \\frac{f_1 f_2}{(f_0 - f_1)(f_0 - f_2)} + (x_1 - x_2) \\frac{f_0 f_2}{(f_1 - f_0)(f_1 - f_2)}\n$$\nThis formulation calculates the estimate as a base value $x_2$ plus a correction. While algebraically identical to the direct formula, its numerical properties can be different. The subtraction of nearly equal values of $x_i$ and $f_i$ is still present in the computation of the correction term. However, this form structures the computation differently. In scenarios where the points $x_i$ are clustered, the terms $(x_i - x_2)$ are small, and the formula computes the final result by adding a potentially small correction to an initial guess $x_2$. This can be more robust than summing three potentially large, unrelated terms as in the direct formula.\n\n### Implementation and Numerical Demonstration\n\nThe two formulas, $\\hat{x}_{\\text{direct}}$ and $\\hat{x}_{\\text{rearr}}$, will be implemented and tested against the provided suite of test cases. All calculations are performed in standard double-precision floating-point arithmetic (IEEE 754). For all test cases, the true root is $r=0$, so the absolute error is simply $|\\hat{x}|$.\n\nThe test cases are:\n*   **Test case 1 (Cancellation-prone cluster):** $f(x)=x^3$, with $x_0=a$, $x_1=a+h$, $x_2=a-h$ for $a=1\\times 10^{-8}$ and $h=1\\times 10^{-16}$. The function values $f_i$ are extremely close, providing conditions for catastrophic cancellation.\n*   **Test case 2 (Well-conditioned):** $f(x)=x$, with $x_0=-1$, $x_1=0.3$, $x_2=2$. For a linear function, the interpolation is exact, and both formulas should yield the correct root $\\hat{x}=0$ (up to machine precision).\n*   **Test case 3 (One point near the root):** $f(x)=x^3$, with $x_0=-1\\times 10^{-6}$, $x_1=1\\times 10^{-6}$, $x_2=1\\times 10^{-12}$. Here, one point $(x_2, f_2)$ is extremely close to the root $(0,0)$. The rearranged formula, constructed as a correction to $x_2$, is expected to perform very well.\n\nThe results from these computations will demonstrate the difference in numerical stability between the two formulas.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef direct_evaluation(x0, x1, x2, f0, f1, f2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the root estimate using the direct evaluation of the\n    Lagrange interpolation formula at f=0.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check for non-distinct function values which would lead to division by zero.\n    if f0 == f1 or f0 == f2 or f1 == f2:\n        # This case is ill-defined for quadratic interpolation.\n        # In a real root-finder, one would fall back to a different method.\n        # For this problem's test cases, it indicates an issue if it occurs.\n        return np.nan\n\n    # Lagrange basis polynomials L_i(f) evaluated at f=0\n    term0 = x0 * f1 * f2 / ((f0 - f1) * (f0 - f2))\n    term1 = x1 * f0 * f2 / ((f1 - f0) * (f1 - f2))\n    term2 = x2 * f0 * f1 / ((f2 - f0) * (f2 - f1))\n    \n    return term0 + term1 + term2\n\ndef rearranged_evaluation(x0, x1, x2, f0, f1, f2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the root estimate using the rearranged formula, derived\n    from the fact that the sum of Lagrange basis polynomials is 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check for non-distinct function values.\n    if f0 == f1 or f0 == f2 or f1 == f2:\n        return np.nan\n\n    # Lagrange basis polynomials L_0(f) and L_1(f) evaluated at f=0\n    L0_at_0 = f1 * f2 / ((f0 - f1) * (f0 - f2))\n    L1_at_0 = f0 * f2 / ((f1 - f0) * (f1 - f2))\n    \n    # Correction term added to the base point x2\n    correction = (x0 - x2) * L0_at_0 + (x1 - x2) * L1_at_0\n    \n    return x2 + correction\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Executes the inverse quadratic interpolation for the test suite\n    and prints the results.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        # Test case 1: Cancellation-prone cluster\n        {\n            \"f\": lambda x: x**3,\n            \"x_coords\": (1e-8, 1e-8 + 1e-16, 1e-8 - 1e-16),\n            \"root\": 0.0\n        },\n        # Test case 2: Well-conditioned linear mapping\n        {\n            \"f\": lambda x: x,\n            \"x_coords\": (-1.0, 0.3, 2.0),\n            \"root\": 0.0\n        },\n        # Test case 3: One point near the root\n        {\n            \"f\": lambda x: x**3,\n            \"x_coords\": (-1e-6, 1e-6, 1e-12),\n            \"root\": 0.0\n        }\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        func = case[\"f\"]\n        x0, x1, x2 = case[\"x_coords\"]\n        r = case[\"root\"]\n\n        # All computations use standard Python floats (IEEE 754 double precision)\n        f0 = func(float(x0))\n        f1 = func(float(x1))\n        f2 = func(float(x2))\n\n        # Calculate estimate using the direct formula\n        x_hat_direct = direct_evaluation(x0, x1, x2, f0, f1, f2)\n        error_direct = abs(x_hat_direct - r)\n        results.append(error_direct)\n\n        # Calculate estimate using the rearranged formula\n        x_hat_rearranged = rearranged_evaluation(x0, x1, x2, f0, f1, f2)\n        error_rearranged = abs(x_hat_rearranged - r)\n        results.append(error_rearranged)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3244093"}]}
