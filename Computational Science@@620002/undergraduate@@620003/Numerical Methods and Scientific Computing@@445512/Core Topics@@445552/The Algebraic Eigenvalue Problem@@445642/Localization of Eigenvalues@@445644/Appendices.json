Disjointness of Disk Unions**\n\nLet's define two sets as the union of these disks:\n$\\mathcal{G}_1 = D_1 \\cup D_2$\n$\\mathcal{G}_2 = D_3 \\cup D_4$\n\nThe set $\\mathcal{G}_1$ is the union of two disks, $D_1$ and $D_2$. Both disks are centered at $z=5$. Since the radius of $D_2$ ($R_2=0.3$) is smaller than the radius of $D_1$ ($R_1=0.4$), the disk $D_2$ is entirely contained within $D_1$, i.e., $D_2 \\subset D_1$. Therefore, their union is simply the larger disk:\n$\\mathcal{G}_1 = D_1 \\cup D_2 = D_1 = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z - 5| \\le 0.4\\}$.\n\nSimilarly, the set $\\mathcal{G}_2$ is the union of two disks, $D_3$ and $D_4$, both centered at $z=-10$. The radius of $D_3$ ($R_3=0.3$) is smaller than the radius of $D_4$ ($R_4=0.35$), so $D_3 \\subset D_4$. Their union is the larger disk:\n$\\mathcal{G}_2 = D_3 \\cup D_4 = D_4 = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z + 10| \\le 0.35\\}$.\n\nTo show that $\\mathcal{G}_1$ and $\\mathcal{G}_2$ are disjoint, we compare the distance between their centers to the sum of their radii.\nThe center of $\\mathcal{G}_1$ is $c_1 = 5$. The radius of $\\mathcal{G}_1$ is $R_{\\mathcal{G}_1} = 0.4$.\nThe center of $\\mathcal{G}_2$ is $c_2 = -10$.

Thus, $\\mathcal{G}_1 \\cap \\mathcal{G}_2 = \\emptyset$.\n\n**3. Eigenvalue Count**\n\nAn important extension of the Gershgorin circle theorem states that if the union of $k$ Gershgorin disks forms a connected component that is disjoint from the union of the other $n-k$ disks, then this component contains exactly $k$ eigenvalues of the matrix (counting multiplicities).\n\nIn our case, the set of all four Gershgorin disks, $\\mathcal{G} = D_1 \\cup D_2 \\cup D_3 \\cup D_4$, can be partitioned into two disjoint sets: $\\mathcal{G} = \\mathcal{G}_1 \\cup \\mathcal{G}_2$, with $\\mathcal{G}_1 \\cap \\mathcal{G}_2 = \\emptyset$.\n\nThe set $\\mathcal{G}_1 = D_1 \\cup D_2$ is formed from the union of $k=2$ disks. This set is connected (in fact, it is a single disk).\nThe set $\\mathcal{G}_2 = D_3 \\cup D_4$ is formed from the union of the remaining $n-k = 4-2=2$ disks. This set is also connected.\n\nSince $\\mathcal{G}_1$ is a connected component formed by $2$ disks and is disjoint from the rest of the Gershgorin disks, it must contain exactly $2$ eigenvalues of $A$.\nSimilarly, $\\mathcal{G}_2$ must contain the other $2$ eigenvalues.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of eigenvalues in the \"rightmost disjoint set (the one whose disks are centered near $5$)\". This corresponds to the set $\\mathcal{G}_1$, which is centered at $z=5$ on the real axis, while $\\mathcal{G}_2$ is centered at $z=-10$.\n\nTherefore, the number of eigenvalues of $A$ lying in the set $\\mathcal{G}_1$ is exactly $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3249310"}, {"introduction": "While the Gershgorin circles are guaranteed to contain all eigenvalues, how tightly do they bound them?

The non-zero entries of $T$ are $T_{i,i+1} = T_{i+1,i} = 1$ for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, 6$. Since both $I_{7}$ and $T$ are real symmetric matrices, their linear combination $A(r)$ is also a real symmetric matrix for any real $r$. A fundamental theorem of linear algebra states that all eigenvalues of a real symmetric matrix are real. This is consistent with the information provided in the problem.\n\nWe now apply the Gershgorin circle theorem. For an $n \\times n$ matrix $A$, this theorem states that all its eigenvalues are contained within the union of $n$ disks in the complex plane, called Gershgorin circles. The $i$-th circle, denoted $D_i$, is centered at the diagonal entry $A_{ii}$ and has a radius $R_i$ equal to the sum of the absolute values of the off-diagonal entries in the $i$-th row. The circle is defined as:\n$$D_i = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z - A_{ii}| \\le R_i \\}, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad R_i = \\sum_{j \\neq i} |A_{ij}|.$$\n\nLet's construct the matrix $A(r)$. The entries of $A(r)$ are given by $A_{ij} = 3 \\delta_{ij} + r T_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\nThe diagonal entries are $A_{ii} = 3 + r T_{ii}$. Since $T$ has zeros on its main diagonal, $T_{ii} = 0$, which gives $A_{ii} = 3$ for all $i=1, 2, \\dots, 7$.\nThe off-diagonal entries are $A_{ij} = r T_{ij}$ for $i \\neq j$. Based on the definition of $T$, the only non-zero off-diagonal entries are $A_{i,i+1} = r$ and $A_{i+1,i} = r$ for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, 6$.\nThe explicit form of the matrix is:\n$$A(r) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n3  r  0  0  0  0  0 \\\\\nr  3  r  0  0  0  0 \\\\\n0  r  3  r  0  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  r  3  r  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  0  r  3  r  0 \\\\\n0  0  0  0  r  3  r \\\\\n0  0  0  0  0  r  3\n\\end{pmatrix}.$$\nThe centers of all $7$ Gershgorin circles are located at the diagonal entries, so for every circle $D_i$, the center is at the point $3$ on the real axis.\n\nNext, we compute the radii $R_i$. Since the problem specifies $r  0$, we have $|r| = r$.\nFor the first row ($i=1$): The radius is $R_1 = |A_{12}| + \\sum_{j  2} |A_{1j}| = |r| + 0 = r$.\nFor the last row ($i=7$): The radius is $R_7 = |A_{76}| = |r| = r$.\nFor the intermediate rows ($i=2, 3, 4, 5, 6$): The radius is $R_i = |A_{i,i-1}| + |A_{i,i+1}| = |r| + |r| = 2r$.\n\nSo, we have two distinct types of Gershgorin circles:\n1. Two circles, $D_1$ and $D_7$, centered at $3$ with radius $r$.\n2. Five circles, $D_2, D_3, D_4, D_5, D_6$, centered at $3$ with radius $2r$.\n\nThe union of all these circles, $\\mathcal{G} = \\bigcup_{i=1}^7 D_i$, is the region guaranteed to contain all the eigenvalues. Since all circles are concentric (centered at $z=3$) and the parameter $r$ is positive, it follows that $2r  r$. The union of these disks is therefore determined by the largest disk. The largest radius is $2r$. Thus, the union $\\mathcal{G}$ is the single closed disk defined by:\n$$\\mathcal{G} = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z - 3| \\le 2r \\}.$$\n\nThe problem requires that this region $\\mathcal{G}$ contains at least one point $z = x + iy$, with $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, such that the magnitude of its imaginary part is at least $31$. This condition is expressed as $|y| \\ge 31$.\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible value of $|y|$ for a point $z = x+iy$ within the disk $\\mathcal{G}$. The inequality defining the disk is $|(x-3) + iy| \\le 2r$. In Cartesian coordinates, this is:\n$$(x-3)^2 + y^2 \\le (2r)^2.$$\nTo maximize $|y|$, we must choose $x$ such that the non-negative term $(x-3)^2$ is minimized. Its minimum value is $0$, which is achieved when $x=3$. Substituting $x=3$ into the inequality gives:\n$$0^2 + y^2 \\le (2r)^2 \\implies y^2 \\le 4r^2.$$\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find $|y| \\le 2r$. This means the maximum possible magnitude of the imaginary part for any point in the union of the Gershgorin circles is exactly $2r$.\n\nThe problem's condition is that this maximum magnitude must be at least $31$. We must therefore have:\n$$2r \\ge 31.$$\nWe are asked for the smallest value of $r$ that satisfies this condition. The minimum value is attained when equality holds:\n$$2r = 31.$$\nSolving for $r$, we find:\n$$r = \\frac{31}{2}.$$\nThis value of $r$ is positive, as required. For $r = 31/2$, the union of the Gershgorin circles is the disk $|z-3| \\le 31$. This disk includes the points $z = 3 \\pm 31i$, for which the imaginary part has a magnitude of exactly $31$. Any smaller value of $r$ would result in a disk where the maximum magnitude of the imaginary part is less than $31$.

For any point $z$ in disk $\\mathcal{D}_i(t)$, we have $\\Re(c_i(t)) - R_i(t) \\le \\Re(z) \\le \\Re(c_i(t)) + R_i(t)$ and $\\Im(c_i(t)) - R_i(t) \\le \\Im(z) \\le \\Im(c_i(t)) + R_i(t)$.\n\nThe real-part bounds for $\\mathcal{G}(t)$ are:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{G},\\Re}(t) = \\min_{i} \\left( \\Re\\left(c_i(t)\\right) - R_i(t) \\right) = \\min\\{1-2t, 3-2t, 5-2t\\} = 1 - 2t.\n$$\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{G},\\Re}(t) = \\max_{i} \\left( \\Re\\left(c_i(t)\\right) + R_i(t) \\right) = \\max\\{1+2t, 3+2t, 5+2t\\} = 5 + 2t.\n$$\nThe imaginary-part bounds for $\\mathcal{G}(t)$ are:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{G},\\Im}(t) = \\min_{i} \\left( \\Im\\left(c_i(t)\\right) - R_i(t) \\right) = \\min\\{1-2t, 2-2t, 3-2t\\} = 1 - 2t.\n$$\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{G},\\Im}(t) = \\max_{i} \\left( \\Im\\left(c_i(t)\\right) + R_i(t) \\right) = \\max\\{1+2t, 2+2t, 3+2t\\} = 3 + 2t.\n$$\nThe area of the bounding rectangle is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{G}}(t) = (U_{\\mathrm{G},\\Re}(t) - L_{\\mathrm{G},\\Re}(t)) \\cdot (U_{\\mathrm{G},\\Im}(t) - L_{\\mathrm{G},\\Im}(t))\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{G}}(t) = ((5 + 2t) - (1 - 2t)) \\cdot ((3 + 2t) - (1 - 2t)) = (4 + 4t)(2 + 4t) = 8 + 24t + 16t^2.\n$$\n\n**3. Computation of $\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{E}}(t)$**\n\nThe eigenvalues $\\{\\lambda_k(t)\\}_{k=1}^3$ of the matrix $A(t)$ must be computed. Except for trivial cases (like $t=0$), this generally requires a numerical algorithm. For each specified value of $t$, the matrix $A(t)$ is constructed, and its eigenvalues are found using a standard numerical library. Let the computed eigenvalues be $\\lambda_1(t), \\lambda_2(t), \\lambda_3(t)$.\n\nThe bounds of the minimal axis-aligned rectangle containing the eigenvalues are:\n- $L_{\\mathrm{E},\\Re}(t) = \\min_{k} \\Re(\\lambda_k(t))$\n- $U_{\\mathrm{E},\\Re}(t) = \\max_{k} \\Re(\\lambda_k(t))$\n- $L_{\\mathrm{E},\\Im}(t) = \\min_{k} \\Im(\\lambda_k(t))$\n- $U_{\\mathrm{E},\\Im}(t) = \\max_{k} \\Im(\\lambda_k(t))$\n\nThe area of this eigenvalue bounding box is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{E}}(t) = (U_{\\mathrm{E},\\Re}(t) - L_{\\mathrm{E},\\Re}(t)) \\cdot (U_{\\mathrm{E},\\Im}(t) - L_{\\mathrm{E},\\Im}(t)).\n$$\n\n**4. Computation of the Localization Tightness Ratio $\\rho(t)$**\n\nThe ratio $\\rho(t)$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\rho(t) = \\frac{\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{G}}(t)}{\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{E}}(t)} = \\frac{16t^2 + 24t + 8}{\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{E}}(t)}.\n$$\nFor $t=0$, $A(0)=D$. The Gershgorin disks are single points (the diagonal entries), and these are also the eigenvalues. Thus, $\\mathcal{G}(0)$ is the set of eigenvalues, which implies $\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{G}}(0) = \\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{E}}(0)$.\n$\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{G}}(0) = 8 + 24(0) + 16(0)^2 = 8$.\nThe eigenvalues are $1+\\mathrm{i}, 3+2\\mathrm{i}, 5+3\\mathrm{i}$. The eigenvalue bounding box area is $\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{E}}(0) = (5-1) \\cdot (3-1) = 8$.\nSo, $\\rho(0) = 8/8 = 1$. For $t0$, the Gershgorin set provides an inclusion region for the eigenvalues, so $\\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{G}}(t) \\ge \\mathrm{Area}_{\\mathrm{E}}(t)$ and $\\rho(t) \\ge 1$. The value of $\\rho(t)$ quantifies the looseness of the Gershgorin bound as approximated by axis-aligned rectangles.\n\nThe following implementation computes $\\rho(t)$ for each test value of $t$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the localization tightness ratio for a set of parameters.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [0.0, 0.1, 0.7, 1.5, 3.0]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    # Define the diagonal matrix D.\n    # D = diag(1+i, 3+2i, 5+3i)\n    D = np.diag([1 + 1j, 3 + 2j, 5 + 3j])\n    \n    # Define the matrix B.\n    # B_ij = 1 for i != j, B_ii = 0.\n    n = 3\n    B = np.ones((n, n)) - np.eye(n)\n\n    for t in test_cases:\n        # Step 1: Construct the matrix A(t)\n        A_t = D + t * B\n\n        # Step 2: Compute Area_G(t)\n        # The formula derived is Area_G(t) = (4 + 4t)(2 + 4t)\n        # which simplifies to 16t^2 + 24t + 8.\n        area_G = 16 * t**2 + 24 * t + 8\n\n        # Step 3: Compute Area_E(t)\n        # 3a: Compute eigenvalues of A(t)\n        eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(A_t)\n        \n        # 3b: Extract real and imaginary parts\n        real_parts = np.real(eigenvalues)\n        imag_parts = np.imag(eigenvalues)\n        \n        # 3c: Calculate the area of the minimal bounding rectangle for eigenvalues\n        if real_parts.size  0:\n            width_E = np.max(real_parts) - np.min(real_parts)\n            height_E = np.max(imag_parts) - np.min(imag_parts)\n        else: # Should not happen for n=3\n            width_E = 0\n            height_E = 0\n        \n        area_E = width_E * height_E\n        \n        # Step 4: Compute the localization tightness ratio rho(t)\n        # If area_E is zero, it means all eigenvalues are collinear (horizontally or vertically)\n        # or are the same point.
