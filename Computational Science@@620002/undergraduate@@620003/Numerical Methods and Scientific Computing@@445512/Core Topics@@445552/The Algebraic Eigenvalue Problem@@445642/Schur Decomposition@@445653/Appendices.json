Our goal is to evaluate the truthfulness of the given statements.\n\nFirst, let's determine the matrix $T$. The definition of the Schur decomposition is $A = U T U^*$. We can rearrange this equation to solve for $T$ by using the property that for a unitary matrix $U$, its inverse is its conjugate transpose, i.e., $U^{-1} = U^*$.\n\nStarting from $O_n = U T U^*$, we left-multiply by $U^*$ and right-multiply by $U$:\n$$U^* O_n U = U^* (U T U^*) U$$\nUsing the associative property of matrix multiplication:\n$$U^* O_n U = (U^* U) T (U^* U)$$\nBy the definition of a unitary matrix, $U^* U = I_n$, where $I_n$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$U^* O_n U = I_n T I_n$$\n$$U^* O_n U = T$$\nThe product of any matrix with the zero matrix is the zero matrix. Thus, $U^* O_n = O_n$, and subsequently $O_n U = O_n$. This implies:\n$$T = O_n$$\nSo, the upper triangular matrix $T$ must be the $n \\times n$ zero matrix. The zero matrix is indeed upper triangular (as all entries below the main diagonal are zero).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement with this finding.\n\n**A. The upper triangular matrix $T$ must be the $n \\times n$ zero matrix $O_n$.**\nAs derived above, $T$ is uniquely determined to be the zero matrix $O_n$. Therefore, this statement is **true**.\n\n**B. The unitary matrix $U$ must be the $n \\times n$ identity matrix $I_n$.**\nLet's substitute $T=O_n$ back into the Schur decomposition equation:\n$$O_n = U O_n U^*$$\nLet's see if this equation constrains $U$. The product of any matrix $U$ with the zero matrix $O_n$ is the zero matrix ($U O_n = O_n$). So the equation becomes:\n$$O_n = O_n U^*$$\nSimilarly, the product of the zero matrix with any matrix $U^*$ is the zero matrix ($O_n U^* = O_n$). The equation simplifies to:\n$$O_n = O_n$$\nThis equation is always true, which means it holds for *any* matrix $U$. The Schur decomposition requires $U$ to be unitary, but places no other restriction on it. Since there exist unitary matrices other than the identity matrix for $n \\ge 2$, the matrix $U$ does not have to be $I_n$. Thus, this statement is **false**.\n\n**C. The unitary matrix $U$ can be any $n \\times n$ unitary matrix.**\nAs shown in the analysis for statement B, the equation $O_n = U O_n U^*$ is satisfied for any choice of $U$. For the equation to represent a Schur decomposition, $U$ must be unitary. Therefore, any $n \\times n$ unitary matrix is a valid choice for $U$ in the Schur decomposition of the zero matrix. This statement is **true**.\n\n**D. The diagonal entries of the upper triangular matrix $T$ are the eigenvalues of $O_n$.**\nA fundamental property of the Schur decomposition $A = UTU^*$ is that the diagonal entries of the upper triangular matrix $T$ are the eigenvalues of the matrix $A$. Let's verify this for our specific case.\nThe eigenvalues of the zero matrix $O_n$ are the roots of its characteristic polynomial, $\\det(O_n - \\lambda I_n) = 0$.\n$$\\det(-\\lambda I_n) = (-\\lambda)^n \\det(I_n) = (-\\lambda)^n = 0$$\nThe only eigenvalue is $\\lambda = 0$, with an algebraic multiplicity of $n$.\nFrom our initial analysis, we found that $T = O_n$. The diagonal entries of the $n \\times n$ zero matrix are all 0.\nThus, the diagonal entries of $T$ are indeed the eigenvalues of $O_n$. This statement is **true**.\n\n**E. There are infinitely many possible choices for the matrix $U$.**\nAs established in the analysis of statement C, any $n \\times n$ unitary matrix is a valid choice for $U$. The set of all $n \\times n$ unitary matrices forms the unitary group $U(n)$. For $n \\ge 2$, this group is a continuous set and is uncountably infinite. For instance, for $n=2$, matrices of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$ for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ are all distinct unitary matrices. Thus, there are infinitely many possible choices for $U$.
