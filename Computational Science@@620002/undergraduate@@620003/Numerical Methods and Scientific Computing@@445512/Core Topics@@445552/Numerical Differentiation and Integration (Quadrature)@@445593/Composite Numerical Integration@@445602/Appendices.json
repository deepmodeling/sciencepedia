It is a well-posed and self-contained exercise in numerical analysis, grounded in established mathematical principles, and free from any scientific or logical flaws.\n\n### Part 1: Composite Simpson's Rule\n\nThe task is to approximate the definite integral $I = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1}{1 + x^2}\\, dx$ using the composite Simpson's method. The function is $f(x) = \\frac{1}{1+x^2}$ on the interval $[a, b] = [0, 1]$. The interval is partitioned into an even number $n$ of subintervals of equal width $h = \\frac{b-a}{n} = \\frac{1}{n}$. The grid points are $x_j = a + jh = \\frac{j}{n}$ for $j=0, 1, \\dots, n$.\n\nThe composite Simpson's rule is derived by applying the basic Simpson's rule to successive pairs of subintervals. The basic rule on an interval $[c, d]$ approximates the integral by integrating a quadratic interpolant at the endpoints and midpoint. The formula for the composite method is:\n$$\nS_n = \\frac{h}{3} \\left[ f(x_0) + 4\\sum_{j=1}^{n/2} f(x_{2j-1}) + 2\\sum_{j=1}^{n/2-1} f(x_{2j}) + f(x_n) \\right]\n$$\nThis formula sums the function values at the endpoints, $4$ times the function values at the odd-indexed interior points (midpoints of Simpson's sub-regions), and $2$ times the function values at the even-indexed interior points (shared endpoints of Simpson's sub-regions).\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of the Error Bound\n\nThe error of the basic Simpson's rule over a single interval of width $2h$, say $[c, c+2h]$, is given by:\n$$\nE_{\\text{basic}} = \\int_c^{c+2h} f(x) \\, dx - \\frac{h}{3}[f(c) + 4f(c+h) + f(c+2h)] = -\\frac{h^5}{90} f^{(4)}(\\xi)\n$$\nfor some $\\xi \\in (c, c+2h)$, provided $f$ is four times continuously differentiable.\n\nThe composite rule consists of $n/2$ such applications over intervals $[x_{2j-2}, x_{2j}]$ for $j=1, 2, \\dots, n/2$. The total error $E_n$ is the sum of the errors from these applications:\n$$\nE_n = \\sum_{j=1}^{n/2} \\left( -\\frac{h^5}{90} f^{(4)}(\\xi_j) \\right)\n$$\nwhere each $\\xi_j \\in (x_{2j-2}, x_{2j})$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem for sums, as $f^{(4)}(x)$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, there exists a value $\\mu \\in (a,b)$ such that $\\sum_{j=1}^{n/2} f^{(4)}(\\xi_j) = \\frac{n}{2} f^{(4)}(\\mu)$.\nSubstituting this into the error sum gives:\n$$\nE_n = -\\frac{h^5}{90} \\left( \\frac{n}{2} \\right) f^{(4)}(\\mu) = -\\frac{nh^5}{180} f^{(4)}(\\mu)\n$$\nSince $h = \\frac{b-a}{n}$, we have $n = \\frac{b-a}{h}$. Substituting for $n$:\n$$\nE_n = -\\frac{(b-a)h^4}{180} f^{(4)}(\\mu)\n$$\nThe absolute value of the error, $|E_n|$, is therefore bounded by:\n$$\n|E_n| \\le \\frac{(b-a)h^4}{180} \\max_{x \\in [a,b]} |f^{(4)}(x)|\n$$\nFor the given problem, $a=0$ and $b=1$, so $b-a=1$ and $h = 1/n$. The error bound takes the form required by the problem, $|E_n| \\le C \\, h^4 \\, \\max_{x \\in [0,1]} |f^{(4)}(x)|$, with the constant $C = \\frac{b-a}{180} = \\frac{1}{180}$. The final theoretical error bound formula to be implemented is:\n$$\nB_n = \\frac{1}{180 n^4} \\max_{x \\in [0,1]} |f^{(4)}(x)|\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Bounding the Fourth Derivative\n\nWe need to compute $f^{(4)}(x)$ for $f(x) = (1+x^2)^{-1}$ and find its maximum absolute value on $[0,1]$.\n\nThe first four derivatives are:\n$f'(x) = -2x(1+x^2)^{-2}$\n$f''(x) = (6x^2 - 2)(1+x^2)^{-3}$\n$f'''(x) = (24x - 24x^3)(1+x^2)^{-4} = 24x(1-x^2)(1+x^2)^{-4}$\n$f^{(4)}(x) = (120x^4 - 240x^2 + 24)(1+x^2)^{-5} = 24 \\frac{5x^4 - 10x^2 + 1}{(1+x^2)^5}$\n\nTo find the maximum of $|f^{(4)}(x)|$ on $[0,1]$, we examine the values at the endpoints and at any interior critical points. The critical points of $f^{(4)}(x)$ are the roots of $f^{(5)}(x)$.\n$f^{(5)}(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}f^{(4)}(x) = \\frac{-240x(3x^4 - 10x^2 + 3)}{(1+x^2)^6}$\nSetting $f^{(5)}(x)=0$, we find critical points at $x=0$ and where $3x^4 - 10x^2 + 3 = 0$. Let $u=x^2$, then $3u^2 - 10u + 3=0$, which factors as $(3u-1)(u-3)=0$. The solutions are $u=1/3$ and $u=3$. This corresponds to $x^2=1/3$ and $x^2=3$. The positive roots are $x=1/\\sqrt{3}$ and $x=\\sqrt{3}$.\nThe critical points in the interval $[0,1]$ are $x=0$ and $x=1/\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nWe evaluate $|f^{(4)}(x)|$ at the endpoints $x=0, x=1$ and the critical point $x=1/\\sqrt{3}$:\n- At $x=0$: $|f^{(4)}(0)| = |24 \\frac{1}{1}| = 24$.\n- At $x=1$: $|f^{(4)}(1)| = |24 \\frac{5 - 10 + 1}{(1+1)^5}| = |24 \\frac{-4}{32}| = |-3| = 3$.\n- At $x=1/\\sqrt{3}$: $|f^{(4)}(1/\\sqrt{3})| = |24 \\frac{5(1/9) - 10(1/3) + 1}{(1+1/3)^5}| = |24 \\frac{5/9 - 30/9 + 9/9}{(4/3)^5}| = |24 \\frac{-16/9}{1024/243}| = |-\\frac{81}{8}| = 10.125$.\n\nComparing these values, the maximum absolute value is $24$, which occurs at $x=0$.\nSo, $\\max_{x \\in [0,1]} |f^{(4)}(x)| = 24$.\n\n### Part 4: Final Theoretical Error Bound\n\nSubstituting $M_4 = 24$ into the error bound formula $B_n$:\n$$\nB_n = \\frac{1}{180 n^4} \\times 24 = \\frac{24}{180 n^4} = \\frac{2}{15 n^4}\n$$\nThis is the explicit theoretical error bound used for verification.\n\n### Part 5: Computational Procedure\n\nThe program will execute the following steps for each $n$ in the test suite $[2, 4, 10, 20, 100]$:\n1.  Calculate the composite Simpson's approximation $S_n$ for $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{1+x^2}dx$.\n2.  Calculate the exact value $I_{\\text{exact}} = \\arctan(1) - \\arctan(0) = \\pi/4$.\n3.  Compute the absolute error $|E_n| = |S_n - I_{\\text{exact}}|$.\n4.  Compute the theoretical error bound $B_n = \\frac{2}{15n^4}$.\n5.  Verify if $|E_n| \\le B_n$.\n6.  Collect these five values ($n, S_n, |E_n|, B_n$, and the boolean verification result) into a list for each $n$, and format the final output as a list of these lists.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the numerical integration problem using composite Simpson's method\n    and verifies the result against a derived theoretical error bound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define problem parameters and test cases\n    a = 0.0\n    b = 1.0\n    I_exact = np.pi / 4.0\n    test_cases_n = [2, 4, 10, 20, 100]\n\n    def f(x):\n        \"\"\" The integrand function f(x) = 1/(1+x^2). \"\"\"\n        return 1.0 / (1.0 + x**2)\n\n    def composite_simpson(f_func, a_val, b_val, n_val):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the definite integral of f_func from a_val to b_val\n        using the composite Simpson's rule with n_val subintervals.\n        n_val must be an even integer.\n        \"\"\"\n        if n_val % 2 != 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"n must be an even integer.\")\n        \n        h = (b_val - a_val) / n_val\n        x_pts = np.linspace(a_val, b_val, n_val + 1)\n        y_pts = f_func(x_pts)\n        \n        # The formula is (h/3) * [y_0 + 4y_1 + 2y_2 + ... + 4y_{n-1} + y_n]\n        s = y_pts[0] + y_pts[-1]\n        \n        # Sum of odd-indexed terms: 4 * (y_1 + y_3 + ... + y_{n-1})\n        s += 4 * np.sum(y_pts[1:-1:2])\n        \n        # Sum of even-indexed terms: 2 * (y_2 + y_4 + ... + y_{n-2})\n        s += 2 * np.sum(y_pts[2:-1:2])\n        \n        return (h / 3.0) * s\n\n    def theoretical_error_bound(n_val):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the theoretical error bound B_n for the composite Simpson's rule.\n        The formula is B_n = (b-a)^5 / (180 * n^4) * M4 if using n.\n        Or (b-a)h^4/180 * M4.\n        For [0,1] and M4=24, this simplifies to 2 / (15 * n^4).\n        \"\"\"\n        return 2.0 / (15.0 * n_val**4)\n\n    results = []\n    for n in test_cases_n:\n        # 1.

It presents a well-posed task in numerical analysis, grounded in the established principles of numerical quadrature. The function, interval, methods, and evaluation criteria are all specified with sufficient precision and are scientifically sound. The problem is a classic demonstration of how the smoothness of an integrand affects the convergence rates of numerical integration schemes.\n\n### 1. Exact Integral Calculation\n\nThe exact value of the integral $I = \\int_{0}^{1} \\lvert x-0.5 \\rvert \\, dx$ is required as a reference for error calculations. The absolute value function is defined piecewise. We split the integral at the point where the argument of the absolute value changes sign, which is $x=0.5$.\n\n$$\nI = \\int_{0}^{1} \\lvert x-0.5 \\rvert \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{0.5} -(x-0.5) \\, dx + \\int_{0.5}^{1} (x-0.5) \\, dx\n$$\n\n$$\nI = \\int_{0}^{0.5} (0.5-x) \\, dx + \\int_{0.5}^{1} (x-0.5) \\, dx\n$$\n\nEvaluating the two definite integrals:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{0.5} (0.5-x) \\, dx = \\left[ 0.5x - \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{0.5} = \\left( 0.5(0.5) - \\frac{(0.5)^2}{2} \\right) - (0) = 0.25 - \\frac{0.25}{2} = 0.125\n$$\n\n$$\n\\int_{0.5}^{1} (x-0.5) \\, dx = \\left[ \\frac{x^2}{2} - 0.5x \\right]_{0.5}^{1} = \\left( \\frac{1^2}{2} - 0.5(1) \\right) - \\left( \\frac{(0.5)^2}{2} - 0.5(0.5) \\right) = (0.5 - 0.5) - (0.125 - 0.25) = 0 - (-0.125) = 0.125\n$$\n\nThe exact value of the integral is the sum of these two parts:\n$$\nI = 0.125 + 0.125 = 0.25\n$$\nGeometrically, this represents the area of two identical right triangles, each with a base of $0.5$ and a height of $0.5$. The area is $2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.5 \\times 0.5 = 0.25$.\n\n### 2. Numerical Quadrature Methods\n\nLet the interval be $[a, b]$, partitioned into $N$ uniform subintervals of width $h = (b-a)/N$. The nodes are $x_i = a + i h$ for $i=0, 1, \\ldots, N$. The integrand is $f(x) = \\lvert x-0.5 \\rvert$.\n\n#### 2.1. Composite Trapezoidal Rule\nThis rule approximates the integral by summing the areas of trapezoids formed by linear interpolants on each subinterval $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$. The formula is:\n$$\nQ_N^{\\text{trap}} = h \\left( \\frac{f(x_0) + f(x_N)}{2} + \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} f(x_i) \\right)\n$$\nThe standard error for the trapezoidal rule is of order $O(h^2)$, assuming the integrand is twice continuously differentiable ($f \\in C^2$). Our function $f(x)$ is only in $C^0$, with a jump discontinuity in its first derivative. However, the trapezoidal rule is exact for linear functions. When $N$ is an even integer, one of the grid points $x_{N/2}$ will coincide with the discontinuity at $x=0.5$. Since $f(x)$ is linear on $[0, 0.5]$ and $[0.5, 1]$, and the nodes are symmetric about $x=0.5$, the trapezoidal rule will sum the areas of the piecewise linear segments exactly. Therefore, for any even $N$, the numerical result will be exact, and the error $E_N$ will be $0$. For odd $N$, $x=0.5$ lies within a subinterval, and a non-zero error is expected.\n\n#### 2.2. Composite Simpson's Rule\nThis rule integrates a piecewise quadratic interpolant over pairs of subintervals (panels). It requires an even number of subintervals, $N$. The formula is:\n$$\nQ_N^{\\text{simp}} = \\frac{h}{3} \\left( f(x_0) + 4\\sum_{i=1, i \\text{ odd}}^{N-1} f(x_i) + 2\\sum_{i=2, i \\text{ even}}^{N-2} f(x_i) + f(x_N) \\right)\n$$\nThe standard error is $O(h^4)$, assuming $f \\in C^4$. Since our function is not smooth, this rate is not achieved. Simpson's rule is exact for polynomials up to degree $3$. The critical factor is whether the discontinuity at $x=0.5$ falls at a panel boundary or within a panel. For $N$ subintervals, there are $N/2$ panels $[x_{2k}, x_{2k+2}]$. The discontinuity lies at a panel boundary if $x=0.5$ is a node $x_{2k}$ for some integer $k$. This occurs when $N$ is a multiple of $4$. In such cases, the function is linear within each panel (e.g., on $[0, 0.5]$ and $[0.5, 1]$), and since Simpson's rule is exact for linear functions, the integration on each half is exact, yielding a total error of $0$. If $N$ is even but not a multiple of $4$ (e.g., $N=2, 6, 10, \\dots$), the point $x=0.5$ falls within a panel, and the quadratic interpolant fails to capture the 'kink', leading to a significant error. The convergence rate in this case degrades to $O(h^2)$.\n\n#### 2.3. Split-Composite Simpson's Rule\nThis adaptive strategy explicitly handles the discontinuity. The domain $[0, 1]$ is split into $[0, 0.5]$ and $[0.5, 1]$. The composite Simpson's rule is then applied to each sub-domain separately.\n$$\nQ_N^{\\text{split}} = Q_{N_{\\text{left}}}^{\\text{simp}}(f, [0, 0.5]) + Q_{N_{\\text{right}}}^{\\text{simp}}(f, [0.5, 1])\n$$\nThe total number of intervals $N$ is partitioned into $N_{\\text{left}}$ and $N_{\\text{right}}$ according to the problem's rules, ensuring both are even and positive. Within each sub-domain, $[0, 0.5]$ and $[0.5, 1]$, the function $f(x)$ is a simple linear function. Since Simpson's rule provides exact results for functions up to cubic polynomials, it will be exact for these linear segments. Consequently, whenever this method is applicable, $Q_N^{\\text{split}}$ will equal the exact integral $I$, and the error $E_N$ will be $0$. The method is not applicable for odd $N$ or for $N=2$ (as per the specified partitioning rules, $N_{\\text{left}}$ becomes nonpositive).\n\n### 3. Error and Convergence Analysis\n\nThe absolute error is $E_N = \\lvert Q_N - I \\rvert$. The empirical order of convergence, $p$, is calculated using the errors from two resolutions, $N$ and $2N$:\n$$\np = \\frac{\\log(E_N / E_{2N})}{\\log(2)}\n$$\nThis formula estimates the exponent in the error relation $E_N \\approx C h^p \\propto C (1/N)^p$. If $E_N$ or $E_{2N}$ is numerically zero (below a threshold of $10^{-15}$) or if the method is not applicable for a given $N$, the empirical order $p$ is assigned the sentinel value of $-1.0$.\n\n### 4. Algorithm Implementation\n\nThe solution is implemented in Python.\n1.  Define the function $f(x)$ and the exact integral value $I=0.25$.\n2.  Implement three separate functions: `composite_trapezoidal`, `composite_simpson`, and `split_composite_simpson`. Each function takes the integrand, interval limits, and number of subintervals $N$ as input. They return the numerical integral or a sentinel value (e.g., $-1.0$) if the method's preconditions are not met (e.g., odd $N$ for Simpson's).\n3.  The `split_composite_simpson` function encapsulates the specific logic for partitioning $N$ into $N_{\\text{left}}$ and $N_{\\text{right}}$ and calls the `composite_simpson` function on the two sub-domains.\n4.  A helper function calculates the empirical order $p$, handling the specified conditions for returning the sentinel value $-1.0$.\n5.  The main part of the program iterates through the list of test cases $(N, 2N)$. For each case, it computes the nine required values: $(E_N, E_{2N}, p)$ for each of the three methods.\n6.

By implementing an adaptive Simpson's method and comparing its performance to a uniform grid, you will learn a key strategy for creating efficient and robust numerical integrators.", "problem": "Consider the numerical evaluation of the definite integral of the function $f(x) = \\exp\\left(-100(x - 0.3)^2\\right)$ on the interval $[0,1]$. The task is to implement two composite numerical integration methods based on the Simpson rule and to compare their accuracy and computational effort:\n\n1. A uniform composite Simpson method over a partition of $[0,1]$ into $N$ equal subintervals, where $N$ is an even integer. If an odd $N$ is supplied, the implementation must increase it by $1$ so that the rule is applicable.\n\n2. An adaptive composite Simpson method with local error control, which recursively subdivides an interval until a specified local absolute tolerance $\\text{tol}$ is met. Local error control must be enforced by comparing the Simpson approximation on an interval with the sum of Simpson approximations on its two halves, and by distributing the tolerance across subintervals in a manner that ensures a globally controlled absolute error.\n\nThe implementation should build from the following fundamental base:\n\n- Polynomial interpolation: approximate a sufficiently smooth function on an interval by a quadratic interpolant through three points and integrate the interpolant exactly.\n- Error behavior of composite polynomial-based quadrature: for sufficiently smooth $f$, the Simpson rule has a truncation error that scales with the fifth power of the interval length for a single panel and yields a fourth-order global convergence rate when applied uniformly.\n\nCompute the true value of the integral using the known antiderivative of a Gaussian function, expressed in terms of the error function, and use it as the ground truth for error calculation.\n\nFor each method, report:\n- The absolute error with respect to the true integral.\n- The number of function evaluations used.\n\nThe program must implement both methods and run the following test suite, where each test case is a pair $(\\text{tol}, N)$:\n\n- Test case 1 (happy path): $\\text{tol} = 10^{-6}$, $N = 100$.\n- Test case 2 (tighter tolerance, finer grid): $\\text{tol} = 10^{-8}$, $N = 1000$.\n- Test case 3 (looser tolerance, coarse grid): $\\text{tol} = 10^{-4}$, $N = 10$.\n- Test case 4 (edge case with minimal uniform panels): $\\text{tol} = 10^{-10}$, $N = 2$.\n- Test case 5 (very strict tolerance): $\\text{tol} = 10^{-12}$, $N = 200$.\n\nYour program must produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets.

The function is a Gaussian, which is analytic and thus infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$), making it an ideal candidate for high-order integration methods.

There are no internal contradictions.\n- **Feasibility**: The required computations are standard and computationally feasible.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid.

True Value of the Integral**\n\nThe integral of a Gaussian function can be expressed in terms of the error function, $\\text{erf}(z) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_0^z e^{-t^2} \\,dt$.\nLet $I = \\int_0^1 \\exp\\left(-100(x - 0.3)^2\\right) \\,dx$.\nWe perform a change of variables. Let $u = \\sqrt{100}(x - 0.3) = 10(x - 0.3)$. This implies $du = 10 \\,dx$, or $dx = \\frac{1}{10} \\,du$.\nThe limits of integration for $u$ are:\n- When $x = 0$, $u = 10(0 - 0.3) = -3$.\n- When $x = 1$, $u = 10(1 - 0.3) = 7$.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n$$ I = \\int_{-3}^{7} e^{-u^2} \\frac{1}{10} \\,du = \\frac{1}{10} \\int_{-3}^{7} e^{-u^2} \\,du $$\nUsing the definition of the error function:\n$$ \\int_a^b e^{-t^2} \\,dt = \\int_0^b e^{-t^2} \\,dt - \\int_0^a e^{-t^2} \\,dt = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} \\left[ \\text{erf}(b) - \\text{erf}(a) \\right] $$\nWith $a = -3$ and $b = 7$, we get:\n$$ I = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} (\\text{erf}(7) - \\text{erf}(-3)) \\right] $$\nUsing the property $\\text{erf}(-z) = -\\text{erf}(z)$, the true value is:\n$$ I_{true} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{20} \\left[ \\text{erf}(7) + \\text{erf}(3) \\right] $$\nThis value will serve as our ground truth for calculating the absolute error of the numerical methods.\n\n**2. Uniform Composite Simpson's Rule**\n\nSimpson's rule approximates the integral of a function $f(x)$ over an interval $[a, b]$ by integrating a quadratic interpolant through the points $(a, f(a))$, $((a+b)/2, f((a+b)/2))$, and $(b, f(b))$. The formula is:\n$$ S(a, b) = \\frac{b-a}{6} \\left[ f(a) + 4f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right) + f(b) \\right] $$\nThe composite Simpson's rule applies this formula over a partition of the integration interval. For a uniform partition of $[a, b]$ into $N$ subintervals of equal width $h = (b-a)/N$ (where $N$ must be an even integer), the points are $x_i = a + ih$ for $i = 0, 1, \\dots, N$. The integral is approximated by:\n$$ S_N = \\frac{h}{3} \\left[ f(x_0) + 4\\sum_{i=1, i \\text{ odd}}^{N-1} f(x_i) + 2\\sum_{i=2, i \\text{ even}}^{N-2} f(x_i) + f(x_N) \\right] $$\nThe number of function evaluations for this method is $N+1$. As per the problem, if an odd $N$ is given, it is incremented to $N+1$, making the number of evaluations $N+2$.\n\n**3. Adaptive Composite Simpson's Rule**\n\nAdaptive quadrature methods adjust the density of evaluation points based on the local behavior of the integrand. The function $f(x)$ has a sharp peak around $x=0.3$ and is nearly zero elsewhere, making it a prime candidate for an adaptive approach. The method works as follows:\n\nFor an interval $[a, b]$, we compute two approximations:\n- A \"coarse\" approximation, $S_1$, using a single Simpson panel over $[a, b]$.\n- A \"fine\" approximation, $S_2$, by summing two Simpson panels over the half-intervals $[a, m]$ and $[m, b]$, where $m = (a+b)/2$.\n\nThe error of the single-panel Simpson rule on an interval of width $h=b-a$ is approximately $E_1 \\approx -\\frac{h^5}{2880} f^{(4)}(\\xi)$. The error of the two-panel approximation is $E_2 \\approx 2 \\times \\left(-\\frac{(h/2)^5}{2880} f^{(4)}(\\eta)\\right) \\approx \\frac{1}{16} E_1$.\nThe true integral $I$ can be written as $I = S_1 + E_1$ and $I = S_2 + E_2$.\nAssuming $f^{(4)}$ is nearly constant over $[a, b]$, we can establish a relationship between the approximations and the error of the finer one, $E_2$:\n$$ S_2 - S_1 \\approx E_1 - E_2 \\approx 16 E_2 - E_2 = 15 E_2 $$\nThus, an estimate for the local error in $S_2$ is $\\text{err} \\approx \\frac{|S_2 - S_1|}{15}$.\n\nThe adaptive algorithm is recursive:\n1.  For a given interval $[a, b]$ and local tolerance $\\text{tol}_{local}$, compute $S_1$ and $S_2$.\n2.  Calculate the error estimate $\\text{err} = \\frac{|S_2 - S_1|}{15}$.\n3.  If $\\text{err}  \\text{tol}_{local}$, the interval is sufficiently resolved. We accept the result and, to improve accuracy, return the Richardson-extrapolated value $I_{[a,b]} = S_2 + \\frac{S_2 - S_1}{15}$. This is a more accurate estimate of the integral over the interval.\n4.  If $\\text{err} \\ge \\text{tol}_{local}$, the interval is not resolved. Subdivide it into $[a, m]$ and $[m, b]$. Recursively call the algorithm on each sub-interval, but with the tolerance halved for each: $\\text{tol}_{local}/2$. The total integral is the sum of the results from the two recursive calls.\n\nTo ensure global error control, the tolerance is distributed proportionally to the interval widths. The initial call is made with the global tolerance $\\text{tol}$. Each recursive step on a half-interval uses half the tolerance of its parent.\n\nTo avoid redundant computations, function values at endpoints and midpoints are passed down through the recursion. A recursive step on $[a, b]$ with known $f(a)$, $f((a+b)/2)$, and $f(b)$ only needs to compute two new values: $f((a+m)/2)$ and $f((m+b)/2)$. The total number of function evaluations is tracked throughout the recursion.\n\nThis adaptive strategy concentrates computational effort on the region around the peak of the Gaussian ($x \\approx 0.3$), where the function changes rapidly, and uses very few evaluations in the flat regions near $x=0$ and $x=1$, leading to high efficiency.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements and compares uniform and adaptive Simpson's rule for integrating\n    a Gaussian function, then runs a suite of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
