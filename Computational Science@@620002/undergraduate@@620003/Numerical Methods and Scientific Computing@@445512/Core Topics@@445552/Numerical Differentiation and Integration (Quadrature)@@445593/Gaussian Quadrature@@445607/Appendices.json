This means the quadrature rule is exact for all polynomials of degree up to and including $2n-1$. We are asked to find a polynomial of degree $2n$ for which the rule is not exact.\n\nA natural candidate for such a polynomial is one that is constructed from the Legendre polynomial $L_n(x)$ itself, as its zeros define the quadrature nodes. Let us construct the specific polynomial $P(x)$ as the square of the $n$-th degree Legendre polynomial:\n$$\nP(x) = [L_n(x)]^2\n$$\nSince $L_n(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$, $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $2n$.\n\nWe will now justify the failure of the quadrature rule to integrate $P(x)$ exactly by computing the exact integral $I_n$ and the quadrature approximation $Q_n$ separately.\n\nFirst, let us compute the quadrature approximation $Q_n$ for $P(x)$:\n$$\nQ_n = Q_n[P] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i P(x_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i [L_n(x_i)]^2\n$$\nBy the definition of the Gauss-Legendre quadrature, the nodes $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ are the zeros of $L_n(x)$. Therefore, for each node $x_i$, we have $L_n(x_i) = 0$. Substituting this into the expression for $P(x_i)$:\n$$\nP(x_i) = [L_n(x_i)]^2 = 0^2 = 0\n$$\nThe value of the polynomial $P(x)$ is zero at every quadrature node. The quadrature sum is therefore:\n$$\nQ_n = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\n\nNext, let us compute the exact integral $I_n$ of $P(x)$ over the interval $[-1, 1]$ with weight function $w(x) = 1$:\n$$\nI_n = I[P] = \\int_{-1}^{1} P(x) \\,dx = \\int_{-1}^{1} [L_n(x)]^2 \\,dx\n$$\nThis integral represents the squared $L^2$-norm of the Legendre polynomial $L_n(x)$ on the interval $[-1, 1]$. The Legendre polynomials form an orthogonal set with respect to the weight function $w(x)=1$ on this interval. The standard orthogonality relation for Legendre polynomials (with the normalization $L_n(1)=1$) is:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} L_m(x) L_n(x) \\,dx = \\frac{2}{2n+1} \\delta_{mn}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_{mn}$ is the Kronecker delta.
