The Forward-Time, Centered-Space (FTCS) scheme is often the first method one might devise for the advection equation, as it seems a direct translation of the partial derivatives.

The error can be decomposed into a superposition of Fourier modes. The evolution of a single Fourier mode with wavenumber $k$ from one time step to the next is governed by a complex amplification factor, $G(k)$. The mode that corresponds to the largest magnitude of this factor, $|G(k)|$, will grow most rapidly and eventually dominate the numerical solution.\n\nYour task is to identify the specific wavenumber $k$ of the Fourier mode that experiences the fastest growth.
