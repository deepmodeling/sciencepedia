Derivation of Shape Functions and Verification of Properties**\n\nA linear Lagrange shape function $N_i(x,y)$ has the general form $N_i(x,y) = a_i + b_i x + c_i y$. The coefficients $a_i, b_i, c_i$ are determined by the fundamental interpolation property $N_i(P_j) = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nFor $N_1(x,y)$, associated with vertex $P_1=(0,0)$:\n- $N_1(0,0) = a_1 = 1$\n- $N_1(1,0) = a_1 + b_1(1) + c_1(0) = 1 + b_1 = 0 \\implies b_1 = -1$\n- $N_1(0,1) = a_1 + b_1(0) + c_1(1) = 1 + c_1 = 0 \\implies c_1 = -1$\nThus, $N_1(x,y) = 1 - x - y$.\n\nFor $N_2(x,y)$, associated with vertex $P_2=(1,0)$:\n- $N_2(0,0) = a_2 = 0$\n- $N_2(1,0) = a_2 + b_2(1) + c_2(0) = b_2 = 1$\n- $N_2(0,1) = a_2 + b_2(0) + c_2(1) = a_2 + c_2 = 0 \\implies c_2 = 0$\nThus, $N_2(x,y) = x$.\n\nFor $N_3(x,y)$, associated with vertex $P_3=(0,1)$:\n- $N_3(0,0) = a_3 = 0$\n- $N_3(1,0) = a_3 + b_3(1) + c_3(0) = a_3 + b_3 = 0 \\implies b_3 = 0$\n- $N_3(0,1) = a_3 + b_3(0) + c_3(1) = c_3 = 1$\nThus, $N_3(x,y) = y$.\n\nThe derived shape functions are $N_1(x,y) = 1-x-y$, $N_2(x,y) = x$, and $N_3(x,y) = y$. These are the barycentric coordinates for this triangle.\n\nVerification of partition of unity:\n$$ N_1(x,y) + N_2(x,y) + N_3(x,y) = (1-x-y) + x + y = 1 $$\nThe sum is identically $1$ over the entire plane, thus verifying the partition of unity property.\n\nVerification of linear completeness:\nA linear field $f(x,y)=c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 y$ can be represented as a linear combination of shape functions, $f(x,y) = \\sum_{i=1}^3 f(P_i) N_i(x,y)$.\nTo reproduce the coordinate function $x$, let $f(x,y) = x$. The nodal values are $f(P_1)=0$, $f(P_2)=1$, $f(P_3)=0$.\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^3 x_i N_i(x,y) = (0)N_1(x,y) + (1)N_2(x,y) + (0)N_3(x,y) = N_2(x,y) = x $$\nTo reproduce the coordinate function $y$, let $f(x,y) = y$. The nodal values are $f(P_1)=0$, $f(P_2)=0$, $f(P_3)=1$.\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^3 y_i N_i(x,y) = (0)N_1(x,y) + (0)N_2(x,y) + (1)N_3(x,y) = N_3(x,y) = y $$\nThis confirms that the linear basis can exactly represent any linear function, satisfying linear completeness.\n\n**2. Computation of the Area of T**\n\nThe area $A$ of the triangle $T$ is given by the integral of $1$ over its domain. The domain is described by $0 \\le x \\le 1$ and $0 \\le y \\le 1-x$.\n$$ A = \\int_T 1 \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\int_0^1 \\left( \\int_0^{1-x} 1 \\, \\mathrm{d}y \\right) \\mathrm{d}x $$\n$$ A = \\int_0^1 [y]_0^{1-x} \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\int_0^1 (1-x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\left[x - \\frac{x^2}{2}\\right]_0^1 = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThe area is $A = 1/2$, which is consistent with the standard formula for a triangle with base $1$ and height $1$.\n\n**3. Computation of the Elemental Stiffness Matrix K**\n\nFirst, we compute the gradients of the shape functions:\n$$ \\nabla N_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial N_1}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial N_1}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\nabla N_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial N_2}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial N_2}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\nabla N_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial N_3}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial N_3}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe gradients are constant vectors. The entries of the stiffness matrix are $K_{ij} = \\int_T \\nabla N_i \\cdot \\nabla N_j \\, \\mathrm{d}A$. Since the integrand $\\nabla N_i \\cdot \\nabla N_j$ is constant over $T$, the integral is simply the product of this constant and the area $A$.\n$$ K_{ij} = (\\nabla N_i \\cdot \\nabla N_j) A = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla N_i \\cdot \\nabla N_j) $$\nWe compute the necessary dot products:\n- $\\nabla N_1 \\cdot \\nabla N_1 = (-1)^2 + (-1)^2 = 2$\n- $\\nabla N_2 \\cdot \\nabla N_2 = 1^2 + 0^2 = 1$\n- $\\nabla N_3 \\cdot \\nabla N_3 = 0^2 + 1^2 = 1$\n- $\\nabla N_1 \\cdot \\nabla N_2 = (-1)(1) + (-1)(0) = -1$\n- $\\nabla N_1 \\cdot \\nabla N_3 = (-1)(0) + (-1)(1) = -1$\n- $\\nabla N_2 \\cdot \\nabla N_3 = (1)(0) + (0)(1) = 0$\nUsing these values, and the symmetry $K_{ij}=K_{ji}$:\n$$ K = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1/2 & -1/2 \\\\ -1/2 & 1/2 & 0 \\\\ -1/2 & 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe matrix $K$ has a one-dimensional null space. A vector $\\mathbf{u} = (u_1, u_2, u_3)^T$ is in the null space of $K$ if $K\\mathbf{u}=\\mathbf{0}$. This corresponds to a discrete function $u_h(x,y) = \\sum_{i=1}^3 u_i N_i(x,y)$ for which the Dirichlet energy is zero:\n$$ \\mathbf{u}^T K \\mathbf{u} = \\int_T \\nabla u_h \\cdot \\nabla u_h \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\int_T |\\nabla u_h|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}A = 0 $$\nSince the integrand is non-negative, the integral can be zero only if $\\nabla u_h = \\mathbf{0}$ everywhere in $T$. This implies that $u_h(x,y)$ must be a constant function, say $u_h(x,y) = c$. Evaluating at the vertices, we find $u_1=c$, $u_2=c$, and $u_3=c$. Therefore, any vector in the null space must be of the form $\\mathbf{u}=c(1,1,1)^T$. This describes a one-dimensional subspace spanned by the vector $(1,1,1)^T$. This null space corresponds to constant functions (e.g., constant potentials, rigid-body translations) which have zero gradient.\n\n**4. Computation of the Elemental Mass Matrix M**\n\nThe entries of the mass matrix are $M_{ij} = \\int_T N_i N_j \\, \\mathrm{d}A$. We use the integration formula for barycentric coordinates over a triangle:\n$$ \\int_T N_1^\\alpha N_2^\\beta N_3^\\gamma \\, \\mathrm{d}A = (2A) \\frac{\\alpha! \\beta! \\gamma!}{(\\alpha+\\beta+\\gamma+2)!} $$\nSince $A = 1/2$, $2A = 1$, the formula simplifies to $\\int_T N_1^\\alpha N_2^\\beta N_3^\\gamma \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\frac{\\alpha! \\beta! \\gamma!}{(\\alpha+\\beta+\\gamma+2)!}$.\n\nDiagonal entries:\n- $M_{11} = \\int_T N_1^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\frac{2!0!0!}{(2+0+0+2)!} = \\frac{2}{4!} = \\frac{2}{24} = \\frac{1}{12}$\n- $M_{22} = \\int_T N_2^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\frac{0!2!0!}{(0+2+0+2)!} = \\frac{2}{4!} = \\frac{2}{24} = \\frac{1}{12}$\n- $M_{33} = \\int_T N_3^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\frac{0!0!2!}{(0+0+2+2)!} = \\frac{2}{4!} = \\frac{2}{24} = \\frac{1}{12}$\n\nOff-diagonal entries (by symmetry $M_{ij}=M_{ji}$):\n- $M_{12} = \\int_T N_1 N_2 \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\frac{1!1!0!}{(1+1+0+2)!} = \\frac{1}{4!} = \\frac{1}{24}$\n- $M_{13} = \\int_T N_1 N_3 \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\frac{1!0!1!}{(1+0+1+2)!} = \\frac{1}{4!} = \\frac{1}{24}$\n- $M_{23} = \\int_T N_2 N_3 \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\frac{0!1!1!}{(0+1+1+2)!} = \\frac{1}{4!} = \\frac{1}{24}$\n\nAssembling the matrix $M$:\n$$ M = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/12 & 1/24 & 1/24 \\\\ 1/24 & 1/12 & 1/24 \\\\ 1/24 & 1/24 & 1/12 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{24} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n**Final Task: Computation of the Determinant of M**\n\nTo find the determinant of $M$, we use the property $\\det(c \\cdot A) = c^n \\det(A)$ for an $n \\times n$ matrix. Here, $c = 1/24$ and $n=3$.\n$$ \\det(M) = \\det\\left(\\frac{1}{24} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{24}\\right)^3 \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant of the inner matrix is:\n$$ \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = 2(2 \\cdot 2 - 1 \\cdot 1) - 1(1 \\cdot 2 - 1 \\cdot 1) + 1(1 \\cdot 1 - 2 \\cdot 1) $$\n$$ = 2(3) - 1(1) + 1(-1) = 6 - 1 - 1 = 4 $$\nTherefore, the determinant of the mass matrix is:\n$$ \\det(M) = \\left(\\frac{1}{24}\\right)^3 \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{24^3} = \\frac{4}{13824} = \\frac{1}{3456} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3456}}$$", "id": "3229959"}, {"introduction": "Once you understand the individual finite element, the next step is to assemble these building blocks into a functional solver.

This document outlines the theoretical derivation of the necessary formulas, adhering to the specified constraints.\n\n### 1. Variational Formulation and Discretization\n\nThe model problem is the boundary value problem (BVP) on the domain $\\Omega = [0,1]$:\n$$ -u''(x) = f(x) \\quad \\text{for } x \\in (0,1) $$\n$$ u(0) = 0, \\quad u(1) = 0 $$\nThe Finite Element Method begins with the weak (or variational) formulation. We multiply the differential equation by a test function $v$ from a suitable function space and integrate over the domain:\n$$ -\\int_0^1 u''(x) v(x) \\,dx = \\int_0^1 f(x) v(x) \\,dx $$\nApplying integration by parts to the left-hand side yields:\n$$ \\int_0^1 u'(x) v'(x) \\,dx - [u'(x)v(x)]_0^1 = \\int_0^1 f(x) v(x) \\,dx $$\nWe seek a solution $u$ in the Sobolev space $H_0^1(0,1)$, which is the space of functions that are square-integrable, have square-integrable first derivatives, and satisfy the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. By choosing the test functions $v$ from the same space $H_0^1(0,1)$, the boundary term $[u'(x)v(x)]_0^1$ vanishes because $v(0)=v(1)=0$. This results in the required weak form: find $u \\in H_0^1(0,1)$ such that\n$$ \\int_0^1 u'(x) v'(x) \\,dx = \\int_0^1 f(x) v(x) \\,dx \\quad \\text{for all } v \\in H_0^1(0,1) $$\nThe FEM discretizes this problem by seeking an approximate solution $u_h$ in a finite-dimensional subspace $V_h \\subset H_0^1(0,1)$. The domain $[0,1]$ is partitioned into $N$ uniform subintervals (elements) $K_e = [x_e, x_{e+1}]$ of length $h=1/N$. The nodes of this mesh are $x_i = i h$ for $i=0, \\dots, N$. The subspace $V_h$ is spanned by continuous, piecewise linear basis functions (\"hat\" functions) $\\phi_i(x)$ defined such that $\\phi_i(x_j) = \\delta_{ij}$. The approximate solution is expressed as a linear combination of these basis functions:\n$$ u_h(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{N} U_j \\phi_j(x) $$\nwhere $U_j=u_h(x_j)$ are the unknown nodal values. The Galerkin method sets the test functions $v$ to be the basis functions $\\phi_i$ for $i=0, \\dots, N$. This leads to a system of linear equations $AU=F$, where $A_{ij} = \\int_0^1 \\phi_j'(x) \\phi_i'(x) \\,dx$ and $F_i = \\int_0^1 f(x) \\phi_i(x) \\,dx$.\n\n### 2. Reference Element, Basis Functions, and Mapping\n\nTo standardize computations, all integrals over a physical element $K_e = [x_e, x_{e+1}]$ are transformed to a reference element, $\\hat{K}=[0,1]$.\n\n**Reference Basis Functions**: On $\\hat{K}$, we define local linear basis functions $\\hat{\\varphi}_i(\\xi)$ for $i=1,2$ corresponding to local nodes $\\xi_1=0$ and $\\xi_2=1$. They are defined by the Lagrange interpolation conditions $\\hat{\\varphi}_i(\\xi_j) = \\delta_{ij}$.\nFor $\\hat{\\varphi}_1(\\xi) = a\\xi+b$:\nThe conditions $\\hat{\\varphi}_1(0)=1$ and $\\hat{\\varphi}_1(1)=0$ yield $b=1$ and $a=-1$. Thus, $\\hat{\\varphi}_1(\\xi) = 1-\\xi$.\nFor $\\hat{\\varphi}_2(\\xi) = c\\xi+d$:\nThe conditions $\\hat{\\varphi}_2(0)=0$ and $\\hat{\\varphi}_2(1)=1$ yield $d=0$ and $c=1$. Thus, $\\hat{\\varphi}_2(\\xi) = \\xi$.\nThe derivatives of these reference basis functions are constants: $\\frac{d\\hat{\\varphi}_1}{d\\xi} = -1$ and $\\frac{d\\hat{\\varphi}_2}{d\\xi} = 1$.\n\n**Isoparametric Mapping**: The affine mapping $F_e: \\hat{K} \\to K_e$ is defined using the same basis functions: $x(\\xi) = x_e \\hat{\\varphi}_1(\\xi) + x_{e+1} \\hat{\\varphi}_2(\\xi) = x_e(1-\\xi) + x_{e+1}\\xi$. For a uniform mesh, this simplifies to $x(\\xi) = x_e + h\\xi$.\nThe Jacobian of this transformation is $J_e = \\frac{dx}{d\\xi} = h$. By the chain rule, a derivative with respect to $x$ is related to the derivative with respect to $\\xi$ by $\\frac{d}{dx} = \\frac{d\\xi}{dx}\\frac{d}{d\\xi} = \\frac{1}{J_e}\\frac{d}{d\\xi} = \\frac{1}{h}\\frac{d}{d\\xi}$.\n\n### 3. Numerical Quadrature\n\nThe problem requires a Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule on $[0,1]$ that is exact for polynomials up to degree $3$. A $n$-point Gauss-Legendre rule is exact for polynomials of degree $2n-1$. Thus, we need $2n-1 \\geq 3$, which implies $n \\geq 2$. We select a $2$-point rule. The standard nodes $\\hat{z}_k$ and weights $\\hat{w}_k$ are defined on $[-1,1]$:\n$$ \\hat{z}_1 = -1/\\sqrt{3}, \\quad \\hat{z}_2 = 1/\\sqrt{3} \\qquad \\hat{w}_1 = 1, \\quad \\hat{w}_2 = 1 $$\nWe transform these to the reference element $\\hat{K}=[0,1]$ using the affine map $\\xi(\\hat{z}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\hat{z}+1)$. The Jacobian of this map is $\\frac{d\\xi}{d\\hat{z}} = 1/2$. The quadrature nodes $\\xi_q$ on $[0,1]$ are the images of $\\hat{z}_k$, and the weights $w_q$ are scaled by the Jacobian:\n$$ \\xi_q = \\frac{1}{2}(\\hat{z}_q+1), \\quad w_q = \\hat{w}_q \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThis gives the rule $\\int_0^1 g(\\xi) d\\xi \\approx \\sum_{q=1}^2 w_q g(\\xi_q)$ with:\n- Nodes: $\\xi_1 = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - 1/\\sqrt{3})$, $\\xi_2 = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + 1/\\sqrt{3})$.\n- Weights: $w_1 = 1/2$, $w_2 = 1/2$.\n\n### 4. Element Stiffness Matrix and Load Vector\n\nThe entries of the global stiffness matrix $A$ and load vector $F$ are assembled from element-level contributions.\n\n**Local Stiffness Matrix**: For an element $K_e$, the $2 \\times 2$ local stiffness matrix $A^{(e)}$ has entries $A_{ij}^{(e)} = \\int_{K_e} (\\varphi_j^{(e)})'(x) (\\varphi_i^{(e)})'(x) \\,dx$, where $\\varphi_i^{(e)}$ are the local basis functions. Transforming to the reference element:\n$$ A_{ij}^{(e)} = \\int_0^1 \\left(\\frac{1}{h}\\frac{d\\hat{\\varphi}_j}{d\\xi}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{h}\\frac{d\\hat{\\varphi}_i}{d\\xi}\\right) h \\,d\\xi = \\frac{1}{h} \\int_0^1 \\frac{d\\hat{\\varphi}_i}{d\\xi} \\frac{d\\hat{\\varphi}_j}{d\\xi} \\,d\\xi $$\nSince the derivatives of the reference basis functions are constant, the integrand is a constant (a polynomial of degree $0$). Our $2$-point quadrature rule is exact for this integral. Performing the integration analytically:\n$A_{11}^{(e)} = \\frac{1}{h} \\int_0^1 (-1)(-1) d\\xi = \\frac{1}{h}$,\n$A_{12}^{(e)} = A_{21}^{(e)} = \\frac{1}{h} \\int_0^1 (-1)(1) d\\xi = -\\frac{1}{h}$,\n$A_{22}^{(e)} = \\frac{1}{h} \\int_0^1 (1)(1) d\\xi = \\frac{1}{h}$.\nSo, the local stiffness matrix is $A^{(e)} = \\frac{1}{h} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**Local Load Vector**: The $2 \\times 1$ local load vector $F^{(e)}$ has entries $F_i^{(e)} = \\int_{K_e} f(x) \\varphi_i^{(e)}(x) \\,dx$.

Assembly, Boundary Conditions, and Solution\n\nThe global matrices $A$ (size $(N+1) \\times (N+1)$) and $F$ (size $(N+1) \\times 1$) are constructed by summing the contributions from all local matrices $A^{(e)}$ and vectors $F^{(e)}$. The local indices $(1, 2)$ on element $e$ map to global indices $(e, e+1)$.\n\nThe homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions $u(0)=0$ and $u(1)=0$ imply that the nodal values $U_0$ and $U_N$ are zero. These degrees of freedom are eliminated from the linear system. This is achieved by removing the first and last rows and columns from the global stiffness matrix $A$ and the first and last entries from the global load vector $F$. This yields a reduced linear system $A_{red} U_{red} = F_{red}$ of size $(N-1) \\times (N-1)$, where $U_{red}=[U_1, \\dots, U_{N-1}]^T$. The reduced stiffness matrix $A_{red}$ is symmetric and positive definite, guaranteeing a unique solution. This system is solved for the unknown interior nodal values. The full solution vector is then assembled as $U = [0, U_1, \\dots, U_{N-1}, 0]^T$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements a 1D FEM solver and runs a diagnostic test suite.\n    \"\"\"\n    TOL = 1e-14\n\n    # ------------------ Core FEM Components ------------------\n\n    def get_reference_element_data():\n        \"\"\"\n        Defines basis functions and quadrature on the reference element [0,1].\n        \"\"\"\n        # Linear Lagrange basis functions and their derivatives on [0,1]\n        phi_hat = [lambda xi: 1 -

This hands-on problem ([@problem_id:3230075]) explores the classic example of shear locking in Timoshenko beam elements. By implementing and comparing full versus reduced integration schemes, you will gain practical insight into how numerical integration techniques can be used to diagnose and cure common pathologies in FEM simulations.", "problem": "You will implement a simple one-dimensional, two-node Timoshenko beam finite element and use Gaussian quadrature (GQ) with selective reduced integration on the shear term to demonstrate the alleviation of shear locking. Shear locking is the phenomenon where a Timoshenko beam element becomes overly stiff in the thin (slender) beam limit because the discrete interpolation cannot simultaneously enforce the zero-shear constraint everywhere while representing bending curvature. Selective under-integration of the shear term reduces the artificial stiffness associated with this incompatibility. Your program must compute tip deflections for several test cases and compare the two integration strategies. All mathematical entities, including symbols, variables, functions, operators, and numbers, must be written in LaTeX.\n\nStart from the Timoshenko beam energy functional. For a beam occupying $x \\in [0,L]$ with transverse displacement $w(x)$ and rotation $\\varphi(x)$, the strain measures are the curvature $\\kappa(x) = \\varphi'(x)$ and the shear strain $\\gamma(x) = w'(x) - \\varphi(x)$. The total strain energy is\n$$\nU = \\int_0^L \\left( E I \\, \\kappa(x)^2 + k \\, A \\, G \\, \\gamma(x)^2 \\right) \\, dx,\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the Young's modulus, $I$ is the second moment of area, $k$ is the shear correction factor, $A$ is the cross-sectional area, and $G$ is the shear modulus.\n\nDiscretize the beam using the Finite Element Method (FEM) with $n$ equal-length elements. Each element spans $x \\in [x_e, x_e + L_e]$ with $L_e = L/n$. Use a two-node element with linear shape functions for both $w(x)$ and $\\varphi(x)$. In the parent coordinate $\\xi \\in [-1,1]$, the shape functions are $N_1(\\xi) = \\frac{1}{2}(1-\\xi)$ and $N_2(\\xi) = \\frac{1}{2}(1+\\xi)$, and the mapping is $x(\\xi) = \\frac{L_e}{2}\\xi + x_{\\text{mid}}$ with $dx/d\\xi = L_e/2$. The interpolations are\n$$\nw(\\xi) = N_1(\\xi) \\, w_1 + N_2(\\xi) \\, w_2, \\quad\n\\varphi(\\xi) = N_1(\\xi) \\, \\varphi_1 + N_2(\\xi) \\, \\varphi_2,\n$$\nso that\n$$\nw'(x) = \\frac{w_2 - w_1}{L_e}, \\quad\n\\varphi'(x) = \\frac{\\varphi_2 - \\varphi_1}{L_e}, \\quad\n\\gamma(\\xi) = \\frac{w_2 - w_1}{L_e} - N_1(\\xi)\\varphi_1 - N_2(\\xi)\\varphi_2.\n$$\nThe bending contribution to the element stiffness follows from the curvature term and yields a constant matrix for the rotation degrees of freedom, while the shear contribution requires integration of $\\gamma(\\xi)^2$. Using Gaussian quadrature (GQ), you will compute the shear stiffness with two strategies:\n- Full integration: use the standard two-point GQ on $\\xi \\in [-1,1]$ with points $\\xi = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$ and weights $w = 1$, and include the Jacobian $dx/d\\xi = L_e/2$.\n- Reduced integration: use one-point GQ on $\\xi \\in [-1,1]$ with the midpoint $\\xi = 0$ and weight $w = 2$, and include the Jacobian $dx/d\\xi = L_e/2$; this is applied only to the shear term, while the bending term is integrated exactly.\n\nAssemble the global stiffness matrix for a cantilever beam clamped at $x=0$ (impose $w(0)=0$ and $\\varphi(0)=0$) and loaded by a tip shear force $P$ in Newtons at $x=L$ (applied to the transverse displacement degree of freedom at the rightmost node). Solve the linear system to obtain the tip deflection $w(L)$ in meters for both integration strategies.\n\nFor each test case, compute a reference tip deflection in meters as follows:\n- For slender beams where shear is negligible, use the Euler–Bernoulli reference $\\delta_{\\mathrm{EB}} = \\dfrac{P L^3}{3 E I}$.\n- For general beams including shear, use the Timoshenko reference $\\delta_{\\mathrm{T}} = \\dfrac{P L^3}{3 E I} + \\dfrac{P L}{k A G}$.\n\nYour program must produce, for each test case, two floats:\n- The ratio $\\rho_{\\text{full}} = \\dfrac{\\delta_{\\text{full}}}{\\delta_{\\text{ref}}}$, where $\\delta_{\\text{full}}$ is the computed tip deflection using full integration on the shear term and $\\delta_{\\text{ref}}$ is the chosen reference deflection.\n- The ratio $\\rho_{\\text{red}} = \\dfrac{\\delta_{\\text{reduced}}}{\\delta_{\\text{ref}}}$, where $\\delta_{\\text{reduced}}$ is the computed tip deflection using reduced integration on the shear term.\n\nThe output must be a single line containing a flattened list of these ratios for all test cases in order, as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example $[r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4]$.\n\nPhysical units must be used consistently: $L$ in meters, $b$ and $t$ in meters, $A = b \\, t$ in square meters, $I = \\dfrac{b t^3}{12}$ in meters to the fourth power, $E$ and $G$ in Pascals, $P$ in Newtons, and all deflections in meters.\n\nImplement the computation from first principles described above without using any formulas that shortcut the derivation path other than well-tested Gaussian quadrature rules and the standard FEM assembly. Do not hard-code any analytical stiffness matrices beyond what follows directly from the stated strain-displacement relations and energy functional.\n\nTest Suite:\nUse the following test suite to evaluate and demonstrate the effect of reduced integration on shear locking:\n- Case $1$ (slender beam, coarse mesh, Euler–Bernoulli reference): $L = 10$, $b = 0.1$, $t = 0.01$, $n = 1$, $P = 1000$, $E = 210\\times 10^9$, $G = 80\\times 10^9$, $k = \\dfrac{5}{6}$, reference type $\\mathrm{EB}$.\n- Case $2$ (slender beam, refined mesh, Euler–Bernoulli reference): $L = 10$, $b = 0.1$, $t = 0.01$, $n = 20$, $P = 1000$, $E = 210\\times 10^9$, $G = 80\\times 10^9$, $k = \\dfrac{5}{6}$, reference type $\\mathrm{EB}$.\n- Case $3$ (moderately thick beam, Timoshenko reference): $L = 1$, $b = 0.1$, $t = 0.5$, $n = 4$, $P = 1000$, $E = 210\\times 10^9$, $G = 80\\times 10^9$, $k = \\dfrac{5}{6}$, reference type $\\mathrm{T}$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the flattened ratios in the exact format $[\\rho_{\\text{full,1}},\\rho_{\\text{red,1}},\\rho_{\\text{full,2}},\\rho_{\\text{red,2}},\\rho_{\\text{full,3}},\\rho_{\\text{red,3}}]$ with each entry a float.", "solution": "The user's request is to validate and solve a problem concerning the implementation of a one-dimensional Timoshenko beam finite element.

The solution will proceed as requested.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution requires the implementation of a finite element model for a Timoshenko beam. The process involves deriving the element stiffness matrix, assembling a global system, applying boundary conditions, and solving for nodal displacements. This will be done for two different numerical integration schemes for the shear term to study shear locking.\n\n**1. Element Formulation**\nThe strain energy $U$ is the sum of bending energy $U_b$ and shear energy $U_s$:\n$U = U_b + U_s = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^{L_e} EI (\\varphi')^2 dx + \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^{L_e} kAG \\gamma^2 dx$.\nThe element stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}^e$ is the sum of the bending stiffness $\\mathbf{K}_b^e$ and shear stiffness $\\mathbf{K}_s^e$. The element nodal degrees of freedom (DOFs) are $\\mathbf{d}^e = [w_1, \\varphi_1, w_2, \\varphi_2]^T$.\n\n**2. Bending Stiffness Matrix $\\mathbf{K}_b^e$**\nWith linear shape functions, the rotational gradient $\\varphi'(x) = (\\varphi_2 - \\varphi_1)/L_e$ is constant within an element. The bending energy integral is exact:\n$U_b = \\frac{1}{2} EI \\left(\\frac{\\varphi_2 - \\varphi_1}{L_e}\\right)^2 L_e = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{EI}{L_e} (\\varphi_2 - \\varphi_1)^2$.\nThis energy corresponds to the bending stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}_b^e$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_b^e = \\frac{E I}{L_e}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & -1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n**3. Shear Stiffness Matrix $\\mathbf{K}_s^e$**\nThe shear strain is $\\gamma(\\xi) = \\frac{w_2 - w_1}{L_e} - (N_1(\\xi)\\varphi_1 + N_2(\\xi)\\varphi_2)$. The shear energy is computed by numerical integration:\n$U_s = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} kAG (\\gamma(\\xi))^2 \\frac{L_e}{2} d\\xi$.\nThe shear stiffness matrix is $\\mathbf{K}_s^e = \\int_{-1}^1 \\mathbf{B}_s(\\xi)^T (kAG) \\mathbf{B}_s(\\xi) \\frac{L_e}{2} d\\xi$, where $\\mathbf{B}_s(\\xi)$ is the strain-displacement matrix for shear.\n\n- **Full Integration (2-point GQ)**: Two-point Gaussian quadrature is exact for polynomials up to degree $3$. The integrand for $\\mathbf{K}_s^e$ contains terms up to $\\xi^2$ (from $N_i(\\xi)N_j(\\xi)$), so $2$-point GQ yields the exact integral for this formulation. This results in:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_{s, \\text{full}}^e = k A G\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1/L_e & 1/2 & -1/L_e & 1/2 \\\\\n1/2 & L_e/3 & -1/2 & L_e/6 \\\\\n-1/L_e & -1/2 & 1/L_e & -1/2 \\\\\n1/2 & L_e/6 & -1/2 & L_e/3\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nFor thin beams, this formulation is overly stiff, a phenomenon known as shear locking. The element tries to enforce the shear-free condition ($\\gamma=0$) at two distinct points, which excessively constrains the kinematic field and prevents proper bending deformation.\n\n- **Reduced Integration (1-point GQ)**: One-point GQ uses only the midpoint $\\xi=0$, where $\\gamma(0) = \\frac{w_2-w_1}{L_e} - \\frac{\\varphi_1+\\varphi_2}{2}$. The integration is approximate, evaluating the integrand only at this point. This yields a different stiffness matrix:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_{s, \\text{red}}^e = k A G\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n 1/L_e & 1/2 & -1/L_e & 1/2 \\\\\n 1/2 & L_e/4 & -1/2 & L_e/4 \\\\\n-1/L_e & -1/2 & 1/L_e & -1/2 \\\\\n 1/2 & L_e/4 & -1/2 & L_e/4\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix is rank-deficient and less stiff. By only imposing the shear constraint at the element's center, it allows for bending deformations that would otherwise be penalized, thus alleviating shear locking.\n\n**4. Global Assembly and Solution**\nThe total element stiffness matrix is $\\mathbf{K}^e = \\mathbf{K}_b^e + \\mathbf{K}_s^e$ (using either $\\mathbf{K}_{s, \\text{full}}^e$ or $\\mathbf{K}_{s, \\text{red}}^e$). These element matrices are assembled into a global stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ for the entire beam ($n$ elements, $n+1$ nodes).\nThe global system is $\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{D} = \\mathbf{F}$, where $\\mathbf{D}$ is the vector of all nodal DOFs and $\\mathbf{F}$ is the global force vector.\n- **Boundary Conditions**: For a cantilever beam, the DOFs at the clamped end ($x=0$) are fixed: $w(0)=0$, $\\varphi(0)=0$. This is enforced by modifying the global matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ and force vector $\\mathbf{F}$.\n- **Load**: A point force $P$ is applied to the transverse displacement DOF at the free end ($x=L$).\nAfter modification, the system is solved for the displacement vector $\\mathbf{D}$. The tip deflection is the transverse displacement at the last node.\n\n**5. Analysis of Test Cases**\nThe code implements this procedure for each test case specified, once with full integration and once with reduced integration.\n- **Case 1 (Slender beam, $n=1$)**: A very slender beam ($L/t = 1000$) with a single element. This is the archetypal case for shear locking. Full integration is expected to yield an extremely stiff response (deflection much smaller than reality, so $\\rho_{\\text{full}} \\ll 1$), while reduced integration should provide a much more reasonable result ($\\rho_{\\text{red}}$ closer to $1$).\n- **Case 2 (Slender beam, $n=20$)**: The same slender beam, but with a refined mesh ($L_e/t = 50$). By using smaller elements, even the fully integrated element can better approximate the bending behavior. Shear locking will be significantly reduced, and both $\\rho_{\\text{full}}$ and $\\rho_{\\text{red}}$ should approach $1$.\n- **Case 3 (Thick beam, $n=4$)**: A short, thick beam ($L/t=2$) where shear deformation is significant and must be accurately modeled. The Timoshenko theory is appropriate here. Since shear effects are real, the more accurate full integration is expected to perform well, as is reduced integration. Both ratios should be close to $1$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes tip deflections for a cantilevered Timoshenko beam using Finite Element Method\n    with both full and selective reduced integration to demonstrate shear locking.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def _compute_tip_deflection(L, b, t, n_elements, P, E, G, k, integration_type):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the tip deflection of a cantilever beam for a given integration scheme.\n\n        Args:\n            L (float): Beam length (m)\n            b (float): Cross-section width (m)\n            t (float): Cross-section thickness (m)\n            n_elements (int): Number of finite elements\n            P (float): Tip load (N)\n            E (float): Young's modulus (Pa)\n            G (float): Shear modulus (Pa)\n            k (float): Shear correction factor\n            integration_type (str): 'full' or 'reduced'\n\n        Returns:\n            float: Tip deflection (m)\n        \"\"\"\n        # 1.
