This structure can be modeled as a `for` loop that runs from $i=1$ to $n$.\n\nFor each iteration of this main loop (i.e., for each user profile), the algorithm calls the `runComplianceScan` sub-procedure. The problem states that `runComplianceScan` performs a constant number of operations, specifically 1000.\n\nSo, in the first iteration (for the first user), 1000 operations are performed.\nIn the second iteration (for the second user), another 1000 operations are performed.\nThis continues for all $n$ users.\n\nTo find the total number of operations $T(n)$, we sum the operations performed in each of the $n$ iterations of the main loop. Since each iteration contributes exactly 1000 operations, the total is:\n$$T(n) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 1000$$\nThis is equivalent to adding 1000 to itself $n$ times:\n$$T(n) = 1000 + 1000 + \\dots + 1000 \\quad (n \\text{ times})$$\n$$T(n) = 1000 \\cdot n$$\n\nNow, we must find the Big-O complexity for $T(n)$.

Assume $1 \\leq M \\leq N$ and an adversarial sequence that maximizes comparisons at each alignment. Express your final answer as a single Big-O expression.", "solution": "The problem asks for the worst-case time complexity of a naive pattern-matching algorithm. The analysis will be performed by first determining the exact number of comparisons in the worst case and then simplifying this count into Big-O notation based on its formal definition.\n\nThe formal definition of Big-O notation for a function of two variables $f(N, M)$ is as follows: $f(N, M) = O(g(N, M))$ if and only if there exist positive constants $c$, $N_0$, and $M_0$ such that for all $N \\ge N_0$ and $M \\ge M_0$ that satisfy the problem's constraints, the inequality $0 \\le |f(N, M)| \\le c \\cdot |g(N, M)|$ holds.\n\nLet the musical piece be represented by an integer sequence $P$ of length $N$, and the target melody by an integer sequence $T$ of length $M$. The constraints given are $1 \\le M \\le N$. The algorithm checks for the presence of the pattern $T$ in the text $P$ by testing every possible alignment.\n\nAn alignment is defined by the starting index $i$ in the text $P$. The pattern $T$ of length $M$ can be aligned with subsequences of $P$ starting at indices from $i=0$ up to $i=N-M$. Therefore, the total number of distinct alignments to check is $(N - M) - 0 + 1 = N - M + 1$.\n\nFor each alignment $i$, the algorithm performs a sequence of note comparisons. It compares the $j$-th note of the melody, $T[j]$, with the corresponding note in the piece, $P[i+j]$, for $j=0, 1, \\dots, M-1$. This process continues until either a mismatch is found (i.e., $T[j] \\neq P[i+j]$), or all $M$ notes of the melody have been compared and found to match. The number of elementary operations (comparisons) for a single alignment $i$ is therefore between $1$ (if a mismatch occurs at $j=0$) and $M$ (if the first $M-1$ notes match, or if all $M$ notes match).\n\nThe problem requires a worst-case analysis. This involves determining the maximum possible number of comparisons. The phrase \"an adversarial sequence that maximizes comparisons at each alignment\" implies that for every single alignment $i$, the number of comparisons performed is maximized. The maximum number of comparisons for one alignment is $M$. This occurs when the\nfirst $M-1$ characters of the pattern match the corresponding characters of the text, forcing the algorithm to proceed to the $M$-th comparison.\n\nWe must verify that such a \"worst-case\" text and pattern can exist. Consider a melody $T$ consisting of $M-1$ identical notes followed by a different note, for example, $T = (a, a, \\dots, a, b)$. Let the piece $P$ consist of $N$ identical notes of the first kind, $P = (a, a, \\dots, a)$. At any alignment $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-M\\}$, the algorithm will compare $T[j]$ with $P[i+j]$. For $j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, M-2\\}$, the comparison will be $T[j]=a$ against $P[i+j]=a$, which is a match. The algorithm will proceed until the $M$-th comparison at index $j=M-1$, where it compares $T[M-1]=b$ with $P[i+M-1]=a$. This is a mismatch. Thus, for every alignment $i$, exactly $M$ comparisons are performed.\n\nThe total number of comparisons in this worst-case scenario, which we denote as $C(N, M)$, is the product of the number of alignments and the number of comparisons performed at each alignment:\n$$C(N, M) = (\\text{Number of alignments}) \\times (\\text{Comparisons per alignment})$$\n$$C(N, M) = (N - M + 1) M$$\n\nTo express this in Big-O notation, we need to find a simple function $g(N, M)$ that serves as an asymptotic upper bound for $C(N, M)$. Let's expand the expression for $C(N, M)$:\n$$C(N, M) = NM - M^2 + M$$\nA natural choice for $g(N, M)$ is $NM$, as it represents the product of the sizes of the two inputs and often characterizes algorithms with nested loops. Let's apply the formal definition to verify if $C(N, M) = O(NM)$. We need to show that there exists a positive constant $c$ such that for all sufficiently large $N$ and $M$ (with $1 \\le M \\le N$), the inequality $(N - M + 1) M \\le c \\cdot NM$ holds.\n\nLet's analyze the inequality:\n$$NM - M^2 + M \\le c \\cdot NM$$\nSince the problem specifies $M \\ge 1$, it follows that $M \\le M^2$. This implies that the term $M - M^2$ is non-positive, i.e., $M - M^2 \\le 0$.\nTherefore, we can write:\n$$NM - M^2 + M \\le NM$$\nThis inequality holds for the choice of $c=1$. It is valid for all $N, M$ satisfying $1 \\le M \\le N$. Thus, based on the formal definition, we have demonstrated that $C(N, M) = O(NM)$.\n\nThe overall time complexity of the procedure is proportional to the number of note comparisons, as each comparison is considered a constant-time operation under the RAM model. Consequently, the worst-case time complexity of the naive pattern-matching algorithm is $O(NM)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{O(NM)}\n$$", "id": "3215980"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice moves from theory to the practical realities of high-performance computing, exploring a crucial limitation of Big-O notation.

A naive implementation uses three nested loops for the indices $i, j, k$. The ordering of these loops significantly impacts performance due to the way modern CPUs handle memory access, specifically through caches. The matrices are stored in row-major order, meaning the memory address of an element $X[i,j]$ is proportional to $iN+j$. Accessing elements sequentially along a row (e.g., $X[i,j]$ followed by $X[i,j+1]$) is a stride-$1$ access, which is highly efficient. Accessing elements down a column (e.g., $X[i,j]$ followed by $X[i+1,j]$) is a stride-$N$ access, which is inefficient for large $N$.\n\nLet's analyze the memory access patterns in the innermost loop for each of the three orderings, as this loop is executed $N^3$ times and dominates the runtime.\n\n1.  **`ijk` ordering:**\n    ```\n    for i = 0 to N-1\n      for j = 0 to N-1\n        // C[i,j] is accumulated in this loop\n        for k = 0 to N-1\n          C[i,j] += A[i,k] * B[k,j]\n    ```\n    In the innermost loop (over $k$), the indices $i$ and $j$ are fixed.\n    - **`A[i,k]`**: Accesses elements of the $i$-th row of $A$ sequentially. This is a stride-$1$ access, which exhibits good spatial locality.\n    - **`B[k,j]`**: Accesses elements of the $j$-th column of $B$. In row-major storage, this is a stride-$N$ access. This has poor spatial locality; if $N$ is larger than the number of elements in a cache line, each access potentially causes a cache miss.\n    - **`C[i,j]`**: The same element is accessed repeatedly, serving as an accumulator. This shows excellent temporal locality and is likely kept in a CPU register.\n\n2.  **`ikj` ordering:**\n    ```\n    for i = 0 to N-1\n      for k = 0 to N-1\n        // A[i,k] is a scalar for the inner loop\n        for j = 0 to N-1\n          C[i,j] += A[i,k] * B[k,j]\n    ```\n    In the innermost loop (over $j$), the indices $i$ and $k$ are fixed.\n    - **`A[i,k]`**: The same element is accessed repeatedly for all $N$ iterations of the inner loop. This has excellent temporal locality.\n    - **`B[k,j]`**: Accesses elements of the $k$-th row of $B$ sequentially. This is a stride-$1$ access, exhibiting good spatial locality.\n    - **`C[i,j]`**: Accesses elements of the $i$-th row of $C$ sequentially. This is also a stride-$1$ access, with good spatial locality.\n    This ordering is the most efficient as all memory accesses in the innermost loop are local (either temporally or spatially with stride-$1$).\n\n3.  **`jik` ordering:**\n    ```\n    for j = 0 to N-1\n      for i = 0 to N-1\n        // C[i,j] is accumulated in this loop\n        for k = 0 to N-1\n          C[i,j] += A[i,k] * B[k,j]\n    ```\n    In the innermost loop (over $k$), the indices $j$ and $i$ are fixed.\n    - **`A[i,k]`**: Accesses elements of the $i$-th row of $A$ sequentially. This is a stride-$1$ access (good spatial locality).\n    - **`B[k,j]`**: Accesses elements of the $j$-th column of $B$. This is a stride-$N$ access (poor spatial locality), same as in the `ijk` ordering.\n    - **`C[i,j]`**: The same element is accessed repeatedly (excellent temporal locality).\n    The innermost loop of the `jik` ordering has the same memory access characteristics as the `ijk` ordering. Both are bottlenecked by the non-local access to matrix $B$.\n\nBased on this analysis, the `ikj` ordering will significantly outperform `ijk` and `jik` on systems with a memory hierarchy. The performance difference stems from the number of cache misses. The number of cache misses for `ijk`/`jik` is on the order of $\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$, while for `ikj` it is on the order of $\\mathcal{O}(N^3/L)$, where $L$ is the number of data elements per cache line.\n\nNow we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. The asymptotic bound $\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ hides constant factors due to the memory hierarchy; changing loop order changes spatial and temporal locality, so the number of cache misses can differ by a factor proportional to $L$, which dominates runtime on modern hardware.**\nThis statement is an accurate high-level summary of the situation. The $\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ complexity refers to the number of arithmetic operations, assuming each has a unit cost. This assumption fails on real hardware where memory access costs are non-uniform. The \"constant factor\" hidden by the Big-O notation is in fact a complex function of cache size, latency, bandwidth, and cache line size $L$. As our analysis showed, the number of cache misses for the inefficient orderings (`ijk`, `jik`) is roughly $N^3$, while for the efficient ordering (`ikj`) it is roughly $N^3/L$. The ratio of misses is indeed proportional to $L$. Because memory access is much slower than arithmetic, this difference in cache performance is the dominant factor in overall runtime for large matrices.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The `ikj` ordering performs fewer floating-point operations than the `ijk` and `jik` orderings, thereby lowering the arithmetic count below $\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$.**\nThis statement is false. The problem statement itself correctly notes that all three orderings perform $N^3$ multiply-add operations. The total number of floating-point operations for the standard algorithm is $2N^3 - N^2$, which is $\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$. Permuting the loops changes the order in which additions and multiplications are performed (e.g., `ijk` computes dot products, `ikj` performs vector-scalar products and additions), but it does not change the total count of these operations.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. In row-major storage, the `ijk` and `jik` orderings access $B[k,j]$ down a column in the innermost loop (stride $N$), yielding about one useful element per cache line and poor Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) behavior, while `ikj` accesses $B[k,j]$ across a row in the innermost loop (stride $1$), enabling hardware prefetch and Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) vectorization; this leads to markedly different runtimes.**\nThis statement provides a detailed and technically correct explanation of the performance difference. Our analysis confirms that `ijk` and `jik` involve a stride-$N$ access to matrix $B$ in the innermost loop. This leads to poor cache utilization (\"one useful element per cache line\"). This large stride can also cause frequent Translation Lookside Buffer (TLB) misses if the matrix is large enough that each step of size $N$ lands in a new memory page. In contrast, the `ikj` ordering accesses all matrices with good locality (stride-$1$ for `B` and `C`, temporal for `A`). The predictable stride-$1$ access patterns are ideal for hardware prefetchers to automatically fetch data into the cache before it is needed and for compilers to generate SIMD (vector) instructions, which perform the same operation on multiple data elements simultaneously. These factors combine to create a large performance gap.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. All three orderings have identical performance because compilers always reorder loops to the optimal layout at compile time independent of data layout and dependencies.**\nThis statement is incorrect. While modern optimizing compilers can and do perform loop transformations like loop interchange, their ability to do so is limited. The compiler must be able to prove that the transformation is safe and preserves the program's semantics. The presence of pointer aliasing, function calls within the loop, or when matrix dimensions are not known at compile time can prevent such optimizations. The claim that they \"always\" succeed is a strong overstatement and empirically false; if it were true, performance tuning of matrix kernels would not be a major field of research. Furthermore, the optimization is critically dependent on data layout, not independent of it.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Under an idealized Random Access Memory (RAM) model with unit-cost memory access and an infinite cache, all three orderings would have indistinguishable performance; the Big-O notation abstracts away such machine-dependent effects, which explains why it does not predict these differences.**\nThis statement correctly identifies the theoretical computer science model that underlies standard asymptotic analysis. In the RAM model, every memory operation has a uniform cost, typically considered $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. An infinite cache effectively simulates this model. Under this model, the total runtime is proportional to the number of arithmetic operations. Since all three loop orderings perform the same number of operations ($\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$), their performance would indeed be indistinguishable. The statement correctly concludes that Big-O notation, being based on this idealized model, abstracts away the real-world effects of the memory hierarchy and is therefore insufficient on its own to predict the observed performance differences.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "3215939"}]}
