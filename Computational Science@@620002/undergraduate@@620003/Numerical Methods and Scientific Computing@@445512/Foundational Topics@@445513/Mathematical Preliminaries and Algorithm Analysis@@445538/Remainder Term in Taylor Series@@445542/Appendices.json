The routine must guarantee a uniform absolute error strictly less than $10^{-16}$ (machine epsilon) over the entire interval $[-1, 1]$. Starting from Taylor's theorem with remainder and the definition of the Maclaurin polynomial, derive a rigorous upper bound on the truncation error over $[-1, 1]$ and determine the minimum integer order $n$ (degree of the polynomial) required to meet the error specification. Express your final answer as a single integer. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires finding the minimum integer order $n$ of the Maclaurin polynomial for the function $f(x) = e^x$ such that the uniform absolute error on the interval $[-1, 1]$ is strictly less than $10^{-16}$.\n\nLet $f(x) = e^x$. The Maclaurin series for $f(x)$ is a Taylor series expansion about the point $x=0$. The $n$-th degree Maclaurin polynomial for $f(x)$ is denoted by $P_n(x)$. According to Taylor's theorem, the function can be expressed as:\n$$f(x) = P_n(x) + R_n(x)$$\nwhere $P_n(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}x^k$ is the polynomial and $R_n(x)$ is the remainder term. The task is to find the minimum integer $n$ such that $\\max_{x \\in [-1, 1]} |R_n(x)|  10^{-16}$.\n\nThe Lagrange form of the remainder term $R_n(x)$ is given by:\n$$R_n(x) = \\frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!}x^{n+1}$$\nfor some value $c$ that lies strictly between $0$ and $x$.\n\nFor the function $f(x) = e^x$, all of its derivatives are also $e^x$. Thus, $f^{(k)}(x) = e^x$ for any integer $k \\ge 0$. Evaluating the $(n+1)$-th derivative at the point $c$, we get $f^{(n+1)}(c) = e^c$. The remainder term for $f(x)=e^x$ is therefore:\n$$R_n(x) = \\frac{e^c}{(n+1)!}x^{n+1}$$\nwhere $c$ is between $0$ and $x$.\n\nWe need to establish a rigorous upper bound for the absolute value of the remainder, $|R_n(x)|$, over the entire interval $x \\in [-1, 1]$.\n$$|R_n(x)| = \\left| \\frac{e^c}{(n+1)!}x^{n+1} \\right| = \\frac{|e^c|}{(n+1)!}|x|^{n+1}$$\nSince the exponential function is always positive, $|e^c| = e^c$.\n$$|R_n(x)| = \\frac{e^c}{(n+1)!}|x|^{n+1}$$\nTo find a uniform bound, we must find the maximum possible value of this expression for any $x \\in [-1, 1]$. This involves maximizing the terms $|x|^{n+1}$ and $e^c$.\n\n1.  The term $|x|^{n+1}$: For $x \\in [-1, 1]$, the function $|x|$ has a maximum value of $1$. Therefore, $\\max_{x \\in [-1, 1]}|x|^{n+1} = 1^{n+1} = 1$.\n\n2.  The term $e^c$: The number $c$ lies between $0$ and $x$. Since $x$ is in the interval $[-1, 1]$, the number $c$ must also be in the interval $[-1, 1]$. The exponential function $y(t) = e^t$ is a strictly increasing function. Thus, its maximum value on the compact interval $[-1, 1]$ occurs at the right endpoint, $t=1$. So, the maximum value of $e^c$ for $c \\in [-1, 1]$ is $e^1 = e$.\n\nCombining these bounds, we can establish an upper bound for $|R_n(x)|$ that is valid for all $x \\in [-1, 1]$:\n$$|R_n(x)| = \\frac{e^c}{(n+1)!}|x|^{n+1} \\le \\frac{\\max_{c \\in [-1, 1]}e^c}{(n+1)!} \\cdot (\\max_{x \\in [-1, 1]}|x|)^{n+1} \\le \\frac{e}{(n+1)!} \\cdot 1^{n+1} = \\frac{e}{(n+1)!}$$\nThus, we have a uniform upper bound for the error:\n$$\\max_{x \\in [-1, 1]} |R_n(x)| \\le \\frac{e}{(n+1)!}$$\nTo satisfy the problem's error specification, it is sufficient to find the minimum integer $n$ that satisfies the stricter condition:\n$$\\frac{e}{(n+1)!}  10^{-16}$$\nThis inequality can be rearranged to solve for $(n+1)!$:\n$$(n+1)!  e \\times 10^{16}$$\nTo find the minimum integer $n$, we can test values of $m = n+1$ until the inequality is satisfied. The numerical value of the right side is $e \\times 10^{16} \\approx 2.71828 \\times 10^{16}$.\n\nLet's compute the factorial $m!$ for increasing integer values of $m$:\n- For $m=18$: $18! \\approx 6.40237 \\times 10^{15}$. This value is not greater than $e \\times 10^{16}$.\n  Checking the error for $n=17$ (since $m=n+1=18$): The error bound is $\\frac{e}{18!} \\approx \\frac{2.71828}{6.40237 \\times 10^{15}} \\approx 4.2458 \\times 10^{-16}$. This is not less than $10^{-16}$. So, $n=17$ is not sufficient.\n\n- For $m=19$: $19! = 19 \\times 18! \\approx 19 \\times (6.40237 \\times 10^{15}) \\approx 1.21645 \\times 10^{17}$.

Then\n$$\nE'(x) = f'(x) - \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}x\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(1+x)^{-1/2} - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4}x,\n$$\nand\n$$\nE''(x) = f''(x) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{4}(1+x)^{-3/2} + \\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nFor $x \\in [0,0.5]$, we have $(1+x)^{-3/2} \\le 1$, so $E''(x) \\ge 0$. Since $E'(0) = 0$ and $E''(x) \\ge 0$ on $[0,0.5]$, it follows that $E'(x) \\ge 0$ and $E(x)$ is nondecreasing on $[0,0.5]$. Therefore the maximum of $E(x)$ on $[0,0.5]$ occurs at $x=0.5$, not at an interior point.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\n- Option A: Correct. We computed the bound $1/128 \\approx 0.0078125$ and the actual error $\\approx 0.005995$, showing the bound is not attained at $x=0.5$ and overestimates by about $30\\%$.\n\n- Option B: Incorrect. Using $M = |f^{(3)}(0.5)|$ does not provide a guaranteed bound for $x=0.5$ and yields a number smaller than the actual error; it certainly does not match the actual error.\n\n- Option C: Correct. Since $f^{(3)}$ is continuous at $0$, $R_2(x) \\sim \\left(\\frac{1}{16}\\right) x^3$ as $x \\to 0^+$, so the Lagrange remainder bound is asymptotically sharp.\n\n- Option D: Incorrect. The error $E(x)$ is nondecreasing on $[0,0.5]$, so its maximum occurs at $x=0.5$, not in the interior.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "3266807"}]}
