The input is a square image with arbitrary spatial resolution, and the analysis is performed on a per-input-pixel basis so that the result is independent of the absolute input size. The encoder (down path) has $L$ resolution levels indexed by $l \\in \\{0,\\dots,L-1\\}$, followed by a bottleneck at level $L$, and then a decoder (up path) with $L$ resolution levels indexed by $l \\in \\{L-1,\\dots,0\\}$. Let the number of feature channels at level $l$ be $2^l c$, where $c$ is a given base channel width. At each encoder level $l \\in \\{0,\\dots,L-1\\}$, there are two convolutional layers, each being a standard two-dimensional convolution with kernel size $k \\times k$, stride $1$, and same padding that preserves the spatial resolution at that level; the two convolutions both take $2^l c$ input channels and produce $2^l c$ output channels. Between encoder levels there is a $2 \\times 2$ non-parametric downsampling by a factor of $2$ in each spatial dimension. The bottleneck at level $L$ consists of two $k \\times k$ convolutions from $2^L c$ channels to $2^L c$ channels. In the decoder, at each level $l \\in \\{L-1,\\dots,0\\}$, there is first a transposed convolution (also called a deconvolution) with kernel size $2 \\times 2$ and stride $2$ that upsamples spatially by a factor of $2$ in each dimension and halves the channels from $2^{l+1} c$ to $2^l c$. The upsampled feature map is concatenated (channel-wise) with the skip connection from the encoder at the same resolution (which has $2^l c$ channels), producing $2^{l+1} c$ channels. This is followed by two standard $k \\times k$ convolutions: the first reduces channels from $2^{l+1} c$ to $2^l c$, and the second keeps channels at $2^l c$. Ignore the cost of pooling, concatenation, bias additions, and nonlinearities. Do not include any final classification layer. Count floating-point operations using the convention that one multiply counts as $1$ floating-point operation and one add counts as $1$ floating-point operation, so a multiply-accumulate contributes $2$ floating-point operations.\n\nTasks:\n- Starting only from the definition that a standard two-dimensional convolution producing an output tensor of spatial area $A$, with kernel size $k \\times k$, $C_{\\text{in}}$ input channels, and $C_{\\text{out}}$ output channels, performs $2 A k^2 C_{\\text{in}} C_{\\text{out}}$ floating-point operations, derive a closed-form expression $F(k,c,L)$ for the total theoretical floating-point operations per input pixel of this U-Net, expressed purely in terms of $k$, $c$, and $L$. Your derivation must account for all encoder blocks, the bottleneck, and all decoder blocks (including the transposed convolutions), and must use the fact that the spatial area at level $l$ is reduced by a factor $4^l$ relative to the input.\n- A hypothetical profiler run reports that, for $k=3$, $c=64$, and $L=4$, the fraction of total floating-point operations attributable to all transposed convolutions combined is approximately $0.14$. Use your derived $F(k,c,L)$ to compute the theoretical fraction attributable to all transposed convolutions and comment on whether the profiler’s report is consistent with theory. No rounding is required.\n- Propose a modification that replaces each $2 \\times 2$ transposed convolution with non-learned bilinear upsampling followed by a $1 \\times 1$ convolution from $2^{l+1} c$ channels to $2^l c$. Using the same counting convention, derive the change in the per-input-pixel floating-point operations implied by this substitution, and identify which term in $F(k,c,L)$ it alters.

The final result is expressed on a per-input-pixel basis by normalizing the total FLOPs by the input image area, denoted as $A_0$.\n\nThe number of feature channels at resolution level $l$ is given by $C_l = 2^l c$. The spatial area at level $l$ is $A_l = \\frac{A_0}{4^l}$. The formula for FLOPs for a standard convolution with output area $A$, kernel size $k \\times k$, $C_{\\text{in}}$ input channels, and $C_{\\text{out}}$ output channels is given as $2 A k^2 C_{\\text{in}} C_{\\text{out}}$.\n\n**1. Encoder Path FLOPs**\nFor each level $l \\in \\{0, \\dots, L-1\\}$, there are two identical $k \\times k$ convolutions. For these convolutions, the input and output channel counts are $C_{\\text{in}} = C_{\\text{out}} = C_l = 2^l c$. The output spatial area is $A_l = \\frac{A_0}{4^l}$. The FLOPs for a single convolution at this level are:\n$$F_{\\text{enc,conv},l} = 2 A_l k^2 C_l^2 = 2 \\left(\\frac{A_0}{4^l}\\right) k^2 (2^l c)^2 = 2 \\left(\\frac{A_0}{4^l}\\right) k^2 (4^l c^2) = 2 A_0 k^2 c^2$$\nSince there are two such convolutions at each of the $L$ encoder levels, the total FLOPs for the encoder path are:\n$$F_{\\text{enc}} = \\sum_{l=0}^{L-1} 2 \\times (2 A_0 k^2 c^2) = L \\times (4 A_0 k^2 c^2) = 4 L A_0 k^2 c^2$$\nThe FLOPs per input pixel for the encoder are $f_{\\text{enc}} = \\frac{F_{\\text{enc}}}{A_0} = 4 L k^2 c^2$.\n\n**2. Bottleneck FLOPs**\nAt level $L$, there are two $k \\times k$ convolutions with $C_{\\text{in}} = C_{\\text{out}} = C_L = 2^L c$ and output area $A_L = \\frac{A_0}{4^L}$. The FLOPs for one such convolution are:\n$$F_{\\text{bottle,conv}} = 2 A_L k^2 C_L^2 = 2 \\left(\\frac{A_0}{4^L}\\right) k^2 (2^L c)^2 = 2 A_0 k^2 c^2$$\nWith two convolutions in the bottleneck, the total bottleneck FLOPs are $F_{\\text{bottle}} = 2 \\times (2 A_0 k^2 c^2) = 4 A_0 k^2 c^2$.\nThe FLOPs per input pixel for the bottleneck are $f_{\\text{bottle}} = \\frac{F_{\\text{bottle}}}{A_0} = 4 k^2 c^2$.\n\n**3. Decoder Path FLOPs**\nFor each level $l \\in \\{L-1, \\dots, 0\\}$, which corresponds to $L$ distinct levels, we calculate the FLOPs for the transposed convolution and the two standard convolutions.\n\n- **Transposed Convolution:** This is a $2 \\times 2$ operation with stride $2$ that upsamples from level $l+1$ to level $l$.\nInput channels: $C_{\\text{in}} = C_{l+1} = 2^{l+1} c$.\nOutput channels: $C_{\\text{out}} = C_l = 2^l c$.\nOutput area: $A_l = \\frac{A_0}{4^l}$.\nThe FLOPs for this operation are:\n$$F_{\\text{deconv},l} = 2 A_l (\\text{kernel\\_size})^2 C_{\\text{in}} C_{\\text{out}} = 2 \\left(\\frac{A_0}{4^l}\\right) (2^2) (2^{l+1} c)(2^l c)$$\n$$F_{\\text{deconv},l} = 8 \\left(\\frac{A_0}{4^l}\\right) (2 \\cdot 2^l c)(2^l c) = 16 A_0 c^2 \\frac{4^l}{4^l} = 16 A_0 c^2$$\nSumming over the $L$ decoder levels, the total FLOPs from all transposed convolutions are $F_{\\text{deconv}} = L \\times (16 A_0 c^2) = 16 L A_0 c^2$. The FLOPs per input pixel are $f_{\\text{deconv}} = 16 L c^2$.\n\n- **Standard Convolutions:** After concatenation with the skip connection, the number of input channels for the first convolution is $C_l + C_l = 2 C_l = 2^{l+1} c$.\nThe first $k \\times k$ convolution reduces channels from $2^{l+1} c$ to $2^l c$:\n$$F_{\\text{dec,conv1},l} = 2 A_l k^2 (2^{l+1}c)(2^l c) = 2 \\left(\\frac{A_0}{4^l}\\right) k^2 (2 \\cdot 2^l c)(2^l c) = 4 A_0 k^2 c^2 \\frac{4^l}{4^l} = 4 A_0 k^2 c^2$$\nThe second $k \\times k$ convolution maps channels from $2^l c$ to $2^l c$:\n$$F_{\\text{dec,conv2},l} = 2 A_l k^2 (2^l c)(2^l c) = 2 \\left(\\frac{A_0}{4^l}\\right) k^2 (2^l c)^2 = 2 A_0 k^2 c^2 \\frac{4^l}{4^l} = 2 A_0 k^2 c^2$$\nThe total FLOPs for standard convolutions per decoder level $l$ is $F_{\\text{dec,convs},l} = 4 A_0 k^2 c^2 + 2 A_0 k^2 c^2 = 6 A_0 k^2 c^2$.\nSumming over $L$ levels yields $F_{\\text{dec,convs}} = L \\times (6 A_0 k^2 c^2) = 6 L A_0 k^2 c^2$. The FLOPs per input pixel are $f_{\\text{dec,convs}} = 6 L k^2 c^2$.\n\n**Total FLOPs per Input Pixel**\nThe total FLOPs per input pixel, $F(k,c,L)$, is the sum of the contributions from all parts:\n$$F(k,c,L) = f_{\\text{enc}} + f_{\\text{bottle}} + f_{\\text{deconv}} + f_{\\text{dec,convs}}$$\n$$F(k,c,L) = 4 L k^2 c^2 + 4 k^2 c^2 + 16 L c^2 + 6 L k^2 c^2$$\nCombining terms:\n$$F(k,c,L) = (4L + 4 + 6L) k^2 c^2 + 16 L c^2$$\n$$F(k,c,L) = (10L + 4) k^2 c^2 + 16 L c^2$$\nFactoring the expression gives the final closed form:\n$$F(k,c,L) = 2 k^2 c^2 (5L + 2) + 16 L c^2$$\n\n**Task 2: Consistency with Profiler Report**\nThe fraction of total FLOPs attributable to transposed convolutions, $\\eta$, is:\n$$\\eta = \\frac{f_{\\text{deconv}}}{F(k,c,L)} = \\frac{16 L c^2}{2 k^2 c^2 (5L + 2) + 16 L c^2} = \\frac{16 L}{2 k^2 (5L + 2) + 16 L}$$\nSubstituting the given values $k=3$ and $L=4$:\n$$\\eta = \\frac{16 \\times 4}{2 \\times 3^2 (5 \\times 4 + 2) + 16 \\times 4} = \\frac{64}{2 \\times 9 \\times 22 + 64} = \\frac{64}{396 + 64} = \\frac{64}{460}$$\nSimplifying and evaluating the fraction:\n$$\\eta = \\frac{16}{115} \\approx 0.13913$$\nThe theoretical value of approximately $0.139$ is consistent with the profiler's reported value of approximately $0.14$.\n\n**Task 3: Modification of the Upsampling Path**\nThe proposed modification replaces each $2 \\times 2$ transposed convolution with non-learned bilinear upsampling followed by a $1 \\times 1$ convolution. The cost of non-parametric upscaling is ignored. The cost of the new $1 \\times 1$ convolution is calculated below.\nAt each decoder level $l$, this convolution has kernel size $k=1$, input channels $C_{\\text{in}}=2^{l+1}c$, output channels $C_{\\text{out}}=2^l c$, and output area $A_l = \\frac{A_0}{4^l}$. The FLOPs per input pixel for this new operation, $f'_{\\text{upsample},l}$, are:\n$$f'_{\\text{upsample},l} = \\frac{2 A_l (1^2) C_{\\text{in}} C_{\\text{out}}}{A_0} = \\frac{2 (\\frac{A_0}{4^l}) (1) (2^{l+1}c)(2^l c)}{A_0} = 2 \\left(\\frac{1}{4^l}\\right) (2 \\cdot 2^l c)(2^l c) = 4 c^2$$\nThis replaces the original per-level cost of a transposed convolution, which was $f_{\\text{deconv},l} = 16 c^2$. The change in FLOPs per pixel at each decoder level is $\\Delta f_l = 4 c^2 - 16 c^2 = -12 c^2$.\nSince this modification applies to all $L$ decoder levels, the total change in per-input-pixel FLOPs is:\n$$\\Delta F = \\sum_{l=0}^{L-1} (-12 c^2) = -12 L c^2$$\nThis modification alters the term in $F(k,c,L)$ representing the total cost of transposed convolutions. The original term, $16 L c^2$, is replaced by the new total cost of upsampling operations, $L \\times (4c^2) = 4Lc^2$. The change is a reduction of $12 L c^2$ FLOPs per input pixel.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2 k^2 c^2 (5L + 2) + 16 L c^2}$$", "id": "3193868"}, {"introduction": "While FLOPs describe the compute required for a forward pass, the memory needed during training is often a more significant constraint.

Consider two alternatives: Batch Normalization (BN) and Group Normalization (GN). Batch Normalization (BN) normalizes each channel using statistics computed across the mini-batch and spatial locations, while Group Normalization (GN) normalizes within each sample using statistics computed across spatial locations and a group of channels of size $m$. Assume the following setting for a particular layer in the encoder: the feature map has height $H$, width $W$, and channels $C$. The mini-batch size is $b$. For BN, per-channel normalization uses $n_{BN} = b \\cdot H \\cdot W$ samples. For GN, per-group normalization within one sample uses $n_{GN} = m \\cdot H \\cdot W$ samples, independent of $b$.\n\nAssume that within the set of values that are normalized together (the aggregation set for either BN or GN), the activations are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) draws from a Gaussian distribution with true mean $0$ and variance $\\sigma^2$.

Derive the Relative Standard Deviation of the Sample Variance**\n\nWe are given that for a sample of size $n$ from a Gaussian distribution with true variance $\\sigma^2$, the unbiased sample variance $\\hat{\\sigma}^2$ satisfies the relation:\n$$\n\\frac{(n-1)\\hat{\\sigma}^2}{\\sigma^2} \\sim \\chi^2_{n-1}\n$$\nwhere $\\chi^2_{n-1}$ denotes the chi-square distribution with $k=n-1$ degrees of freedom.\n\nLet the random variable be $X = \\frac{(n-1)\\hat{\\sigma}^2}{\\sigma^2}$. We can express $\\hat{\\sigma}^2$ in terms of $X$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n-1} X\n$$\nWe need to find the variance of $\\hat{\\sigma}^2$, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\sigma}^2)$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\sigma}^2) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n-1} X\\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n-1}\\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}(X)\n$$\nThe variance of a chi-square distribution with $k$ degrees of freedom is $2k$. In our case, $k=n-1$. Therefore, $\\mathrm{Var}(X) = 2(n-1)$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\sigma}^2)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\sigma}^2) = \\frac{(\\sigma^2)^2}{(n-1)^2} \\cdot 2(n-1) = \\frac{2(\\sigma^2)^2}{n-1}\n$$\nThe standard deviation of $\\hat{\\sigma}^2$ is the square root of its variance:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\sigma}^2)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(\\sigma^2)^2}{n-1}} = \\sigma^2 \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n-1}}\n$$\nThe relative standard deviation (RSD) is defined as $\\mathrm{RSD}(\\hat{\\sigma}^2) \\equiv \\frac{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\sigma}^2)}}{\\sigma^2}$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{RSD}(\\hat{\\sigma}^2) = \\frac{\\sigma^2 \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n-1}}}{\\sigma^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n-1}}\n$$\nThis is the required expression for the RSD as a function of the sample size $n$.\n\n**2. Compute the RSD for Group Normalization (GN)**\n\nThe parameters for the layer are $H=16$, $W=16$, $C=64$. For GN, there are $G=8$ groups.\nThe number of channels per group is $m = C/G = 64/8 = 8$.\nThe aggregation set size for GN, $n_{GN}$, is given by the formula $n_{GN} = m \\cdot H \\cdot W$.\n$$\nn_{GN} = 8 \\cdot 16 \\cdot 16 = 8 \\cdot 256 = 2048\n$$\nNow, we use the derived RSD formula with $n = n_{GN}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{RSD}(\\hat{\\sigma}_{GN}^2) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n_{GN}-1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{2048-1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{2047}}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\n\\mathrm{RSD}(\\hat{\\sigma}_{GN}^2) \\approx \\sqrt{0.00097704} \\approx 0.0312576\n$$\nRounding to three decimal places, $\\mathrm{RSD}(\\hat{\\sigma}_{GN}^2) \\approx 0.031$. This value is independent of the batch size $b$.\n\n**3. Compute the Minimum Batch Size for Batch Normalization (BN)**\n\nThe aggregation set size for per-channel BN is $n_{BN} = b \\cdot H \\cdot W$.\n$$\nn_{BN} = b \\cdot 16 \\cdot 16 = 256b\n$$\nWe want to find the minimum integer $b$ such that $\\mathrm{RSD}(\\hat{\\sigma}_{BN}^2) \\le 0.05$.\nUsing the RSD formula:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n_{BN}-1}} \\le 0.05\n$$\nSquaring both sides of the inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{2}{n_{BN}-1} \\le (0.05)^2 = 0.0025\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $n_{BN}$:\n$$\nn_{BN}-1 \\ge \\frac{2}{0.0025}\n$$\n$$\nn_{BN}-1 \\ge 800\n$$\n$$\nn_{BN} \\ge 801\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $n_{BN}$:\n$$\n256b \\ge 801\n$$\n$$\nb \\ge \\frac{801}{256} \\approx 3.1289\n$$\nSince the batch size $b$ must be an integer, the minimum value for $b$ is $4$.\n\n**4. Interpretation of Results**\n\n*   **Group Normalization (GN)**: The statistical accuracy of the variance estimate, measured by $\\mathrm{RSD}(\\hat{\\sigma}^2) \\approx 0.031$, is very high (low error). This value is well below the target of $0.05$ and is independent of the batch size $b$. This implies that GN should provide stable normalization even for very small batch sizes (e.g., $b=1$ or $b=2$).\n*   **Batch Normalization (BN)**: The accuracy of its variance estimate is directly dependent on the batch size $b$. For small batch sizes like $b=1$ or $b=2$, the value of $n_{BN}$ would be $256$ or $512$ respectively, leading to RSD values of $\\sqrt{2/255} \\approx 0.0885$ and $\\sqrt{2/511} \\approx 0.0625$. Both are greater than $0.05$, indicating noisy estimates. To achieve a reasonably accurate variance estimate ($\\mathrm{RSD} \\le 0.05$), a minimum batch size of $b=4$ is required.\n*   **Conclusion**: For small batch sizes ($b < 4$), BN provides a noisy, less reliable estimate of statistics compared to GN. Therefore, GN is more likely to yield stable training when the batch size is small. The statistical accuracy of GN in this setting is indeed independent of $b$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. For BN, $n_{BN} = b \\cdot H \\cdot W$. For GN, $n_{GN} = (C/G) \\cdot H \\cdot W$ and is independent of $b$. With $H = 16, W = 16, C = 64, G = 8$, GN has $\\mathrm{RSD} \\approx 0.031$ and meets the $\\le 0.05$ target for any $b \\ge 1$. BN requires a minimum $b = 4$ to satisfy $\\mathrm{RSD} \\le 0.05$. GN is therefore more stable at small $b$.**\n    This statement accurately restates the formulas for $n_{BN}$ and $n_{GN}$. It correctly calculates the RSD for GN ($\\approx 0.031$) and correctly determines the minimum batch size for BN as $b=4$. The interpretation that GN is more stable at small $b$ is a direct and correct consequence of these calculations.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. For BN, $n_{BN} = b \\cdot C \\cdot H \\cdot W$ because all channels are pooled. For GN, $n_{GN} = (C/G) \\cdot H \\cdot W$. With the given numbers, BN already satisfies $\\mathrm{RSD} \\le 0.05$ at $b = 1$ and is more stable than GN for small $b$.**\n    The premise for BN's sample size, $n_{BN} = b \\cdot C \\cdot H \\cdot W$, contradicts the problem statement which specifies *per-channel* normalization with $n_{BN} = b \\cdot H \\cdot W$. Standard BN normalizes each channel independently over the batch. The claim that BN is more stable for small $b$ is the opposite of what our analysis shows.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. The $\\mathrm{RSD}$ of $\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}$ scales as $1/n$. With the given numbers, BN needs $b = 8$ to match GN’s error, and both GN and BN fail to meet the $\\mathrm{RSD} \\le 0.05$ target.**\n    The scaling is incorrect. We derived $\\mathrm{RSD}(\\hat{\\sigma}^2) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n-1}}$, which scales as $1/\\sqrt{n}$ for large $n$, not $1/n$. The statement that both methods fail to meet the target is false; GN meets it for any $b$, and BN meets it for $b \\ge 4$.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. GN’s variance estimate depends on $b$ via running averages, so it becomes unstable for small $b$, whereas BN remains stable due to its learned affine parameters; hence BN requires no minimum $b$ for stability in this layer.**\n    This statement fundamentally misunderstands both GN and BN. GN's statistics are calculated per-sample and are independent of $b$, as explicitly stated in the problem setup. Running averages are characteristic of BN's inference mode, not GN's training mode. The claim that BN is stable for any $b$ due to affine parameters is also false; the affine parameters cannot compensate for the high noise in statistical estimates derived from very small batches. Our calculation shows a minimum $b$ is required for a given level of statistical precision.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3193892"}]}
