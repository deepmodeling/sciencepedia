At a given level, suppose we must choose $K$ anchor shapes (width $w$ and height $h$) per spatial location. Anchors are matched to ground-truth boxes by Intersection-over-Union (IoU) thresholding: an anchor is considered a match for a ground-truth object if its IoU with that object is at least a threshold $\\tau$, where IoU for same-centered rectangles is defined by the ratio of intersection area to union area. Recall is defined as the fraction of ground-truth boxes that have at least one matched anchor.\n\nWe construct anchor shapes per level by running $k$-means clustering on the set of ground-truth box shapes projected to that level, using $(\\log w, \\log h)$ as features. Consider two choices of clustering dissimilarity:\n- Choice $1$: Euclidean distance in $(\\log w, \\log h)$, that is $d_{E}((w,h),(w',h')) = \\sqrt{\\left(\\log w - \\log w'\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\log h - \\log h'\\right)^{2}}$.\n- Choice $2$: IoU-based dissimilarity for same-centered boxes, that is $d_{I}((w,h),(w',h')) = 1 - \\mathrm{IoU}((w,h),(w',h'))$.\n\nAssume the following stylized small-object distribution on a finest SSD level (small stride): two equally likely modes of small boxes, with mode $\\mathcal{A}$ having shape $(w,h) = (20,5)$ and mode $\\mathcal{B}$ having shape $(w,h) = (5,20)$ (pixel units).

Which statement best captures the behavior?\n\nA. For small $K$, IoU-based clustering (Choice $2$) tends to yield higher small-object recall than Euclidean clustering in $(\\log w, \\log h)$ (Choice $1$), because the objective aligns directly with IoU-based matching; recall is non-decreasing in $K$ for both objectives, and the recall gap narrows as $K$ increases.\n\nB.

The shapes are determined by running $k$-means clustering on the set of ground-truth box shapes projected to that level.\n- **Clustering Features**: The features used for clustering are $(\\log w, \\log h)$.\n- **Matching Criterion**: An anchor is a match for a ground-truth object if their Intersection-over-Union (IoU) is at least a threshold $\\tau$.\n- **IoU Definition**: For same-centered rectangles, IoU is the ratio of intersection area to union area.\n- **Recall Definition**: The fraction of ground-truth boxes that have at least one matched anchor.\n- **Clustering Dissimilarity Choices**:\n  - Choice $1$: Euclidean distance, $d_{E}((w,h),(w',h')) = \\sqrt{\\left(\\log w - \\log w'\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\log h - \\log h'\\right)^{2}}$.\n  - Choice $2$: IoU-based dissimilarity, $d_{I}((w,h),(w',h')) = 1 - \\mathrm{IoU}((w,h),(w',h'))$.\n- **Specific Scenario**:\n  - A single, finest SSD level is considered.\n  - The ground-truth box distribution consists of two equally likely modes:\n    - Mode $\\mathcal{A}$: shape $(w,h) = (20,5)$.\n    - Mode $\\mathcal{B}$: shape $(w,h) = (5,20)$.\n  - The IoU threshold is $\\tau = 0.5$.\n  - An explicit assumption is made of \"same-centered anchors and ground-truth boxes\".\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is grounded in the well-established field of deep learning for object detection. The concepts of SSD, anchor boxes, IoU, recall, and $k$-means clustering for anchor generation are standard components of modern object detection literature (e.g., in YOLOv2 and subsequent works). Both dissimilarity metrics are plausible choices for clustering. The problem is a valid, stylized exercise in understanding the model's behavior.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a specific, albeit simplified, scenario and asks for a qualitative comparison of two methods. The assumptions (e.g., same-centered boxes) are stated clearly and render the problem analyzable. A unique line of reasoning can be followed to deduce the behavior of the system under the given conditions.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language. All terms are either standard in the field or explicitly defined. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. The analysis can proceed.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem is to compare how two different clustering objectives for generating anchor boxes affect recall on a specific bimodal distribution of ground-truth (GT) boxes. Recall is achieved for a GT box if its IoU with at least one of the $K$ anchor boxes is $\\ge 0.5$. The anchor boxes are the centroids found by $k$-means. We will analyze the cases for small $K$ and the trend as $K$ increases.\n\nThe IoU for two same-centered boxes with dimensions $(w_1, h_1)$ and $(w_2, h_2)$ is:\n$$ \\mathrm{IoU} = \\frac{\\text{Area(Intersection)}}{\\text{Area(Union)}} = \\frac{\\min(w_1, w_2) \\cdot \\min(h_1, h_2)}{w_1 h_1 + w_2 h_2 - \\min(w_1, w_2) \\cdot \\min(h_1, h_2)} $$\n\nThe two GT box modes are $\\mathcal{A}: (w_A, h_A) = (20, 5)$ and $\\mathcal{B}: (w_B, h_B) = (5, 20)$. The IoU threshold is $\\tau = 0.5$.\n\n### Analysis for $K=1$\nFor $K=1$, we seek a single anchor box (cluster centroid) that best represents the entire distribution.\n\n**Choice 1: Euclidean clustering in $(\\log w, \\log h)$ space.**\nThe $k$-means algorithm with $K=1$ will find the mean of the data points. The data points in the feature space are $(\\log 20, \\log 5)$ and $(\\log 5, \\log 20)$. Since the modes are equally likely, the centroid $(\\log w_{\\text{anchor}}, \\log h_{\\text{anchor}})$ is the average:\n$$ \\log w_{\\text{anchor}} = \\frac{\\log 20 + \\log 5}{2} = \\frac{\\log(20 \\cdot 5)}{2} = \\frac{\\log 100}{2} = \\log(10) $$\n$$ \\log h_{\\text{anchor}} = \\frac{\\log 5 + \\log 20}{2} = \\frac{\\log(5 \\cdot 20)}{2} = \\frac{\\log 100}{2} = \\log(10) $$\nThis corresponds to an anchor box shape of $(w_{\\text{anchor}}, h_{\\text{anchor}}) = (10, 10)$. This is the geometric mean of the component dimensions.\n\nNow, we calculate the IoU of this $(10, 10)$ anchor with the two GT modes:\n- IoU with Mode $\\mathcal{A}$ $(20, 5)$:\n$$ \\mathrm{IoU}((10,10), (20,5)) = \\frac{\\min(10,20) \\cdot \\min(10,5)}{10 \\cdot 10 + 20 \\cdot 5 - \\min(10,20) \\cdot \\min(10,5)} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 5}{100 + 100 - 50} = \\frac{50}{150} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\n- By symmetry, the IoU with Mode $\\mathcal{B}$ $(5, 20)$ is also $1/3$.\n\nSince $\\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.333 < \\tau = 0.5$, this anchor box fails to match any GT box from either mode. Therefore, the recall for Choice $1$ with $K=1$ is $0\\%$.\n\n**Choice 2: IoU-based clustering.**\nThe objective of $k$-means with dissimilarity $1 - \\mathrm{IoU}$ is to find a centroid that maximizes the average IoU with the data points in its cluster. For $K=1$, we seek a single anchor $(w, h)$ that maximizes the sum of IoUs with both modes (since they are equally likely): $\\mathrm{IoU}((w,h), (20,5)) + \\mathrm{IoU}((w,h), (5,20))$. The anchor $(10,10)$ from Choice $1$ gives a total IoU sum of $1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3$.\n\nHowever, consider choosing one of the modes as the anchor, e.g., $(w_{\\text{anchor}}, h_{\\text{anchor}}) = (20, 5)$.\n- IoU with Mode $\\mathcal{A}$ $(20, 5)$: $\\mathrm{IoU}((20,5), (20,5)) = 1.0$.\n- IoU with Mode $\\mathcal{B}$ $(5, 20)$:\n$$ \\mathrm{IoU}((20,5), (5,20)) = \\frac{\\min(20,5) \\cdot \\min(5,20)}{20 \\cdot 5 + 5 \\cdot 20 - \\min(20,5) \\cdot \\min(5,20)} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 5}{100 + 100 - 25} = \\frac{25}{175} = \\frac{1}{7} $$\nThe total IoU sum is $1 + 1/7 = 8/7 \\approx 1.14$. Since $8/7 > 2/3$, an anchor shape that perfectly matches one mode is a better centroid under this objective than the \"average\" anchor from Choice $1$. A $k$-means procedure would converge to one of the two modes (or a shape very close to one of them). Assuming the anchor is $(20,5)$:\n- GT boxes of Mode $\\mathcal{A}$ are matched, as their IoU is $1.0 \\ge 0.5$.\n- GT boxes of Mode $\\mathcal{B}$ are not matched, as their IoU is $1/7 \\approx 0.14 < 0.5$.\nSince the modes are equally likely, $50\\%$ of the GT boxes are matched. The recall for Choice $2$ with $K=1$ is $50\\%$.\n\n### Analysis for $K \\ge 2$\nFor $K=2$, we seek two anchors. Given the two distinct modes, any reasonable clustering algorithm should dedicate one cluster center to each mode.\n- **Choice 1**: The two points in log-space are $(\\log 20, \\log 5)$ and $(\\log 5, \\log 20)$. For $K=2$, $k$-means will place one centroid at each point. The resulting anchors will be $(20,5)$ and $(5,20)$.\n- **Choice 2**: The IoU-based clustering will also find that the optimal two centroids are the modes themselves, as this arrangement maximizes the intra-cluster IoU perfectly (average IoU of $1.0$ in each cluster). The anchors will be $(20,5)$ and $(5,20)$.\n\nWith these two anchors, any GT box of Mode $\\mathcal{A}$ will have an IoU of $1.0$ with the $(20,5)$ anchor, and any GT box of Mode $\\mathcal{B}$ will have an IoU of $1.0$ with the $(5,20)$ anchor. In both cases, the IoU exceeds the threshold $\\tau=0.5$. Thus, for $K=2$, both methods achieve $100\\%$ recall.\n\n### General Behavior\n1.  **Small $K$**: For $K=1$, Choice $2$ (IoU-based) yields a much higher recall ($50\\%$) than Choice $1$ ($0\\%$). This is because the objective of Choice $2$ is directly aligned with the final evaluation goal (high IoU), whereas the Euclidean distance in log-space is only a proxy which fails in this specific case.\n2.  **Increasing $K$**: Recall is a non-decreasing function of $K$. Adding more diverse anchors can only cover more GT boxes or maintain the current coverage; it can never reduce it.\n3.  **Gap Narrowing**: The recall gap between Choice $2$ and Choice $1$ is $50\\%$ for $K=1$. For $K \\ge 2$, the gap is $0\\%$ as both achieve $100\\%$ recall. The gap narrows and disappears as $K$ increases sufficiently to cover all modes in the data.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For small $K$, IoU-based clustering (Choice $2$) tends to yield higher small-object recall than Euclidean clustering in $(\\log w, \\log h)$ (Choice $1$), because the objective aligns directly with IoU-based matching; recall is non-decreasing in $K$ for both objectives, and the recall gap narrows as $K$ increases.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with our derivation.\n- For small $K$ (e.g., $K=1$), Choice $2$ recall ($50\\%$) is higher than Choice $1$ recall ($0\\%$).\n- The reason provided (direct alignment of objective) is correct.\n- Recall is non-decreasing in $K$.\n- The recall gap narrows as $K$ increases (from $50\\%$ at $K=1$ to $0\\%$ at $K=2$).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. For small $K$, Euclidean clustering in $(\\log w, \\log h)$ (Choice $1$) yields higher small-object recall than IoU-based clustering (Choice $2$), since logarithms favor small sizes; moreover, increasing $K$ decreases recall due to overfitting anchors to modes.**\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds.\n- The first clause is factually wrong; our analysis showed Choice $1$ yields lower recall for $K=1$.\n- The claim that increasing $K$ decreases recall is fundamentally incorrect. Recall is non-decreasing in the number of anchors. \"Overfitting\" to modes is precisely what is desired to maximize recall.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The recall of small objects is independent of $K$, and both clustering objectives achieve the same recall for any $K$ because SSD is multi-level.**\nThis statement is incorrect.\n- Recall is not independent of $K$; for Choice $1$, it went from $0\\%$ to $100\\%$ as $K$ went from $1$ to $2$.\n- The objectives do not achieve the same recall for any $K$; they differ at $K=1$.\n- The mention of SSD being multi-level is irrelevant to the specific question which is constrained to a single level.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Choosing Euclidean clustering in $(\\log w, \\log h)$ (Choice $1$) makes increasing $K$ unnecessary, because the logarithm guarantees IoU above the threshold $\\tau$ for all small objects regardless of anchor shape.**\nThis statement is nonsensical.\n- Increasing $K$ from $1$ to $2$ was absolutely necessary for Choice $1$ to achieve any recall.\n- The use of a logarithm in feature space provides no guarantee whatsoever on the resulting IoU values, which demonstrably depend on the anchor shape. Our calculation for $K=1$ yielded an IoU of $1/3$, which is below the threshold.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3146221"}, {"introduction": "After matching a ground-truth object to an anchor box, the detector's task is to predict refinements to the anchor's position and size.

The overlapping region in the $x$-dimension is $[\\max(-\\frac{1}{2}, d-\\frac{1}{2}), \\min(\\frac{1}{2}, d+\\frac{1}{2})]$. Since $0 < d < 1$, this simplifies to $[d-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}]$. The width of the intersection is $w_I = \\frac{1}{2} - (d-\\frac{1}{2}) = 1-d$.\nSimilarly, the height of the intersection is $h_I = 1-d$.\nThe area of intersection is $A_I = (1-d)^2$.\n\nThe union of the two boxes, $U = B_{gt} \\cup B_p$, has an area given by $A_U = A_{gt} + A_p - A_I$.\n$$A_U = 1 + 1 - (1-d)^2 = 2 - (1-d)^2$$\n\nThe Intersection over Union (IoU) is defined as $\\mathrm{IoU} = \\frac{A_I}{A_U}$.\n$$\\mathrm{IoU} = \\frac{(1-d)^2}{2 - (1-d)^2}$$\nThe problem states that $\\mathrm{IoU} = 0.5$. We use this to solve for $d$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{(1-d)^2}{2 - (1-d)^2} $$\n$$ 2 - (1-d)^2 = 2(1-d)^2 $$\n$$ 2 = 3(1-d)^2 $$\n$$ (1-d)^2 = \\frac{2}{3} $$\nSince $0 < d < 1$, we have $1-d > 0$. Taking the positive square root:\n$$ 1-d = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} $$\n$$ d = 1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} $$\nThis value of $d$ satisfies the condition $0 < d < 1$, as $\\sqrt{2/3} \\approx 0.816$, so $d \\approx 0.184$.\n\n#### Calculation of Losses\nWe now calculate the value of each loss function for this specific configuration.\n\n1.  **IoU Loss ($L_{\\mathrm{IoU}}$)**\n    The IoU loss is defined as $L_{\\mathrm{IoU}} = 1 - \\mathrm{IoU}$. Given that $\\mathrm{IoU} = 0.5$:\n    $$ L_{\\mathrm{IoU}} = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 $$\n\n2.  **Generalized IoU Loss ($L_{\\mathrm{GIoU}}$)**\n    The GIoU loss is defined as $L_{\\mathrm{GIoU}} = 1 - \\mathrm{GIoU} = 1 - \\left(\\mathrm{IoU} - \\frac{A_C - A_U}{A_C}\\right) = L_{\\mathrm{IoU}} + \\frac{A_C - A_U}{A_C}$, where $C$ is the smallest convex bounding box enclosing both $B_{gt}$ and $B_p$, and $A_C$ is its area.\n\n    The minimal $x$-coordinate is $-\\frac{1}{2}$ (from $B_{gt}$) and the maximal is $d+\\frac{1}{2}$ (from $B_p$).\n    The minimal $y$-coordinate is $-\\frac{1}{2}$ (from $B_{gt}$) and the maximal is $d+\\frac{1}{2}$ (from $B_p$).\n    The width of $C$ is $w_C = (d+\\frac{1}{2}) - (-\\frac{1}{2}) = 1+d$.\n    The height of $C$ is $h_C = (d+\\frac{1}{2}) - (-\\frac{1}{2}) = 1+d$.\n    The area of $C$ is $A_C = (1+d)^2$.\n\n    The penalty term is $\\frac{A_C - A_U}{A_C}$.\n    $A_C - A_U = (1+d)^2 - [2 - (1-d)^2] = (1+2d+d^2) - [2-(1-2d+d^2)] = 1+2d+d^2-2+1-2d+d^2 = 2d^2$.\n    The penalty is $\\frac{2d^2}{(1+d)^2}$.\n    $$ L_{\\mathrm{GIoU}} = L_{\\mathrm{IoU}} + \\frac{2d^2}{(1+d)^2} = 0.5 + 2\\left(\\frac{d}{1+d}\\right)^2 $$\n\n3.  **Distance IoU Loss ($L_{\\mathrm{DIoU}}$)**\n    The DIoU loss is defined as $L_{\\mathrm{DIoU}} = L_{\\mathrm{IoU}} + \\frac{\\rho^2(b_{gt}, b_p)}{c^2}$, where $\\rho(b_{gt}, b_p)$ is the Euclidean distance between the box centers, and $c$ is the diagonal length of the enclosing box $C$.\n\n    The center of $B_{gt}$ is $b_{gt}=(0,0)$. The center of $B_p$ is $b_p=(d,d)$.\n    The squared distance between centers is $\\rho^2 = (d-0)^2 + (d-0)^2 = 2d^2$.\n    The squared diagonal length of $C$ is $c^2 = w_C^2 + h_C^2 = (1+d)^2 + (1+d)^2 = 2(1+d)^2$.\n\n    The penalty term is $\\frac{2d^2}{2(1+d)^2} = \\frac{d^2}{(1+d)^2}$.\n    $$ L_{\\mathrm{DIoU}} = L_{\\mathrm{IoU}} + \\frac{d^2}{(1+d)^2} = 0.5 + \\left(\\frac{d}{1+d}\\right)^2 $$\n\n4.  **Complete IoU Loss ($L_{\\mathrm{CIoU}}$)**\n    The CIoU loss adds an additional penalty for aspect ratio consistency: $L_{\\mathrm{CIoU}} = L_{\\mathrm{DIoU}} + \\alpha v$.\n    The term $v$ measures the consistency of aspect ratio: $v = \\frac{4}{\\pi^2}\\left(\\arctan\\frac{w_{gt}}{h_{gt}} - \\arctan\\frac{w_p}{h_p}\\right)^2$.\n    In this problem, both boxes are squares with width $w=1$ and height $h=1$.\n    $w_{gt}=1, h_{gt}=1 \\implies \\arctan\\frac{w_{gt}}{h_{gt}} = \\arctan(1) = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\n    $w_{p}=1, h_{p}=1 \\implies \\arctan\\frac{w_{p}}{h_{p}} = \\arctan(1) = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\n    Therefore, $v = \\frac{4}{\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)^2 = 0$.\n    Since $v=0$, the additional penalty term $\\alpha v = 0$.\n    $$ L_{\\mathrm{CIoU}} = L_{\\mathrm{DIoU}} = 0.5 + \\left(\\frac{d}{1+d}\\right)^2 $$\n\n#### Comparison\nWe have the following expressions for the four losses:\n-   $L_{\\mathrm{IoU}} = 0.5$\n-   $L_{\\mathrm{GIoU}} = 0.5 + 2\\left(\\frac{d}{1+d}\\right)^2$\n-   $L_{\\mathrm{DIoU}} = 0.5 + \\left(\\frac{d}{1+d}\\right)^2$\n-   $L_{\\mathrm{CIoU}} = 0.5 + \\left(\\frac{d}{1+d}\\right)^2$\n\nWe found $d = 1 - \\sqrt{2/3}$. Since $0 < \\sqrt{2/3} < 1$, we know $d > 0$. Consequently, the term $\\left(\\frac{d}{1+d}\\right)^2$ is strictly positive.\nThis means $L_{\\mathrm{GIoU}}$, $L_{\\mathrm{DIoU}}$, and $L_{\\mathrm{CIoU}}$ are all greater than $L_{\\mathrm{IoU}}$.\n\nComparing the remaining three, we see that $L_{\\mathrm{DIoU}} = L_{\\mathrm{CIoU}}$. We need only compare $L_{\\mathrm{GIoU}}$ with $L_{\\mathrm{DIoU}}$.\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{GIoU}} = 0.5 + 2\\left(\\frac{d}{1+d}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{DIoU}} = 0.5 + \\left(\\frac{d}{1+d}\\right)^2 $$\nSince $2\\left(\\frac{d}{1+d}\\right)^2 > \\left(\\frac{d}{1+d}\\right)^2$, it is evident that $L_{\\mathrm{GIoU}} > L_{\\mathrm{DIoU}}$.\nThus, we have the ordering:\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{GIoU}} > L_{\\mathrm{DIoU}} = L_{\\mathrm{CIoU}} > L_{\\mathrm{IoU}} $$\nThe loss that yields the largest penalty value is the Generalized Intersection over Union loss, $L_{\\mathrm{GIoU}}$. According to the problem's encoding, this corresponds to $k=2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3146191"}]}
