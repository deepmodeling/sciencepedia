Let the empirical squared loss (sum of squared errors) on a dataset $\\{(x_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^{3}$ be $J(w_1, w_2) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left(f(x_i; w_1, w_2) - y_i\\right)^{2}$ and consider the training data points $(x_1, y_1) = (1, 2)$, $(x_2, y_2) = (3, 1)$, and $(x_3, y_3) = (5, 4)$.\n\nStarting from core definitions of the empirical risk and the nonlinearity $\\sigma$, analyze the shape of the loss landscape $J(w_1, w_2)$ with respect to $w_1$ and $w_2$ by addressing:\n- the presence of kinks due to non-differentiability of $\\sigma$,\n- plateaus caused by dead neurons (regions where $\\sigma(w_1 x_i) = 0$ across all training inputs),\n- saddle-like behavior near $w_1 = 0$.\n\nThen, using subdifferential analysis appropriate for nonsmooth functions, determine the Clarke subdifferential of $J$ with respect to $w_1$ at $w_1 = 0$ as a function of $w_2$.

Do not round your answer. No units are required.", "solution": "We begin from the core definitions. The model is $f(x; w_1, w_2) = \\sigma(w_1 x) + w_2$ with $\\sigma(z) = \\max(0, z)$, and the empirical loss is $J(w_1, w_2) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left(\\sigma(w_1 x_i) + w_2 - y_i\\right)^{2}$. The dataset is $(x_1, y_1) = (1, 2)$, $(x_2, y_2) = (3, 1)$, and $(x_3, y_3) = (5, 4)$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the qualitative shape.\n\n1. Kinks: The function $\\sigma(z)$ is non-differentiable at $z = 0$. In our parameterization, the argument is $z_i(w_1) = w_1 x_i$. Since $x_i  0$ for all $i$, the locus $w_1 = 0$ induces $z_i(0) = 0$ simultaneously for all $i$. Therefore, $J(w_1, w_2)$ has a kink at $w_1 = 0$ for any fixed $w_2$, because the composition through $\\sigma$ changes its form at this boundary.\n\n2. Plateaus and dead neurons: For $w_1 \\leq 0$ and $x_i  0$, we have $w_1 x_i \\leq 0$ and thus $\\sigma(w_1 x_i) = 0$ for all $i$. In that region, the neuron is “dead” on the dataset, and the model reduces to $f(x_i; w_1, w_2) = w_2$. Consequently, $J(w_1, w_2) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (w_2 - y_i)^{2}$ becomes independent of $w_1$. This implies a plateau in the $w_1$ direction for all $w_1 \\leq 0$: the loss is flat with respect to changes in $w_1$ in that half-space.\n\n3. Saddle-like behavior near $w_1 = 0$: Although $J$ is flat in $w_1$ for $w_1 \\leq 0$, the behavior for $w_1  0$ can decrease the loss if the data admits a better fit via the active neuron contribution $\\sigma(w_1 x_i) = w_1 x_i$. Thus, at the boundary $w_1 = 0$, the loss can be flat in one direction (non-increasing for $w_1 \\leq 0$) while descending in another direction ($w_1  0$), which is characteristic of a saddle-like region in the loss landscape.\n\nWe next compute the Clarke subdifferential of $J$ with respect to $w_1$ at $w_1 = 0$ for a fixed $w_2$. For nonsmooth analysis, recall that at $z = 0$ the Clarke subdifferential of $\\sigma$ is the interval $\\partial \\sigma(0) = [0, 1]$. For each data point, define the residuals at $(w_1, w_2) = (0, w_2)$ as $\\Delta_i(w_2) = w_2 - y_i$, since $\\sigma(0) = 0$. A single summand is $g_i(w_1, w_2) = \\left(\\sigma(w_1 x_i) + w_2 - y_i\\right)^{2}$. Its generalized derivative with respect to $w_1$ at $w_1 = 0$ can be obtained by a chain rule for Clarke subdifferentials: an element of $\\partial_{w_1} g_i(0, w_2)$ is $2 \\left(\\sigma(0) + w_2 - y_i\\right) \\cdot v_i x_i$ with $v_i \\in [0, 1]$, i.e.,\n$$\n\\partial_{w_1} g_i(0, w_2) = \\left\\{ 2 \\Delta_i(w_2) \\, v_i \\, x_i \\, : \\, v_i \\in [0, 1] \\right\\}.\n$$\nSumming over $i = 1, 2, 3$ yields\n$$\n\\partial_{w_1} J(0, w_2) = \\left\\{ 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\Delta_i(w_2) \\, v_i \\, x_i \\, : \\, v_i \\in [0, 1] \\right\\}.\n$$\nLet $a_i(w_2) = \\Delta_i(w_2) x_i = (w_2 - y_i) x_i$. Then the set above is\n$$\n\\left\\{ 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{3} a_i(w_2) v_i \\, : \\, v_i \\in [0, 1] \\right\\}.\n$$\nBecause the $v_i$ range independently over $[0, 1]$, the set of sums $\\sum_{i} a_i v_i$ is the interval\n$$\n\\left[ \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\min\\{a_i(w_2), 0\\} \\,,\\, \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\max\\{a_i(w_2), 0\\} \\right],\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\partial_{w_1} J(0, w_2) = 2 \\cdot \\left[ \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\min\\{a_i(w_2), 0\\} \\,,\\, \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\max\\{a_i(w_2), 0\\} \\right].\n$$\n\nWe now find $w_2^{\\star}$ minimizing $J(0, w_2)$. On the plateau $w_1 \\leq 0$, the loss is $J(0, w_2) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (w_2 - y_i)^{2}$, which is a convex quadratic in $w_2$. Its unique minimizer is the sample mean,\n$$\nw_2^{\\star} = \\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} y_i = \\frac{2 + 1 + 4}{3} = \\frac{7}{3}.\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the one-sided directional derivative of $J$ at $(w_1, w_2) = (0, w_2^{\\star})$ in the direction $d = (1, 0)$, which corresponds to increasing $w_1$ from zero while holding $w_2$ at $w_2^{\\star}$.

This criterion must be able to distinguish between true local minima and saddle points or flat regions where the gradient is small, a common challenge in deep learning optimization.\n\nFirst, we derive the stopping criterion from fundamental principles. Let $L(\\mathbf{w})$ be a smooth, twice-differentiable loss function, where $\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is the parameter vector. The second-order Taylor expansion of $L$ around a point $\\mathbf{w}_k$ is given by:\n$$\nL(\\mathbf{w}_k + \\mathbf{p}) \\approx M_k(\\mathbf{p}) = L(\\mathbf{w}_k) + \\nabla L(\\mathbf{w}_k)^T \\mathbf{p} + \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{p}^T H_k \\mathbf{p}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{p}$ is a step vector, $\\nabla L(\\mathbf{w}_k)$ is the gradient of $L$ at $\\mathbf{w}_k$, and $H_k = \\nabla^2 L(\\mathbf{w}_k)$ is the Hessian matrix at $\\mathbf{w}_k$. $M_k(\\mathbf{p})$ is a quadratic model of the loss function in the neighborhood of $\\mathbf{w}_k$.\n\nA standard second-order optimization method, such as Newton's method, seeks to find the step $\\mathbf{p}$ that minimizes this quadratic model. To find the minimum of $M_k(\\mathbf{p})$, we set its gradient with respect to $\\mathbf{p}$ to zero:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\mathbf{p}} M_k(\\mathbf{p}) = \\nabla L(\\mathbf{w}_k) + H_k \\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nAssuming the Hessian $H_k$ is invertible, this gives the Newton step $\\mathbf{p}_N$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{p}_N = -H_k^{-1} \\nabla L(\\mathbf{w}_k)\n$$\nA point $\\mathbf{w}_*$ is considered a strict local minimum if it satisfies two conditions: first, it is a stationary point, $\\nabla L(\\mathbf{w}_*) = \\mathbf{0}$, and second, the Hessian $H_*$ is positive definite, meaning all its eigenvalues are strictly positive. An optimization algorithm should stop when it reaches a point that sufficiently approximates these conditions.\n\nA simple first-order stopping criterion like $||\\nabla L(\\mathbf{w}_k)||  \\epsilon$ is insufficient, as it would incorrectly declare convergence at saddle points where the gradient is small but negative curvature is present. A principled second-order criterion must inspect the Hessian.\n\nThe first condition for our stopping criterion is therefore based on the curvature. We require the Hessian to be \"sufficiently\" positive definite to ensure we are in a convex basin, consistent with a local minimum. This is expressed by requiring the minimum eigenvalue of the Hessian, $\\lambda_{\\min}(H_k)$, to be greater than or equal to a small positive tolerance, $\\tau_\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\text{Condition 1: } \\lambda_{\\min}(H_k) \\ge \\tau_\\lambda  0\n$$\n\nThe second condition addresses the magnitude of potential improvement. If the Newton step $\\mathbf{p}_N$ is taken, the predicted reduction in the loss function based on the quadratic model is:\n$$\n\\Delta M_k = M_k(\\mathbf{0}) - M_k(\\mathbf{p}_N) = L(\\mathbf{w}_k) - \\left( L(\\mathbf{w}_k) + \\nabla L(\\mathbf{w}_k)^T \\mathbf{p}_N + \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{p}_N^T H_k \\mathbf{p}_N \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $\\mathbf{p}_N = -H_k^{-1} \\nabla L(\\mathbf{w}_k)$ and $H_k \\mathbf{p}_N = -\\nabla L(\\mathbf{w}_k)$:\n$$\n\\Delta M_k = - \\left( \\nabla L(\\mathbf{w}_k)^T (-H_k^{-1} \\nabla L(\\mathbf{w}_k)) + \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{p}_N^T (-\\nabla L(\\mathbf{w}_k)) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta M_k = \\nabla L(\\mathbf{w}_k)^T H_k^{-1} \\nabla L(\\mathbf{w}_k) - \\frac{1}{2} (-H_k^{-1} \\nabla L(\\mathbf{w}_k))^T \\nabla L(\\mathbf{w}_k)\n$$\nAssuming $H_k$ (and thus $H_k^{-1}$) is symmetric, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Delta M_k = \\nabla L(\\mathbf{w}_k)^T H_k^{-1} \\nabla L(\\mathbf{w}_k) - \\frac{1}{2} \\nabla L(\\mathbf{w}_k)^T H_k^{-1} \\nabla L(\\mathbf{w}_k) = \\frac{1}{2} \\nabla L(\\mathbf{w}_k)^T H_k^{-1} \\nabla L(\\mathbf{w}_k)\n$$\nThis quantity represents the predicted decrease achievable by moving to the minimum of the local quadratic model. It is inherently scale-aware because it is scaled by the inverse Hessian. A small gradient might still lead to a large predicted decrease if the curvature is small in that direction (i.e., a small eigenvalue of $H_k$ leads to a large entry in $H_k^{-1}$).

Define the loss function $L(w)$ as the superposition of a double-well-like term anchored at two minima and a ring-shaped valley:\n$$\nP(w) = \\left((w_1+1)^2 + w_2^2\\right)\\left((w_1-1)^2 + w_2^2\\right),\n$$\n$$\nR(w; A, r_0, s) = -A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\left(\\sqrt{w_1^2 + w_2^2} - r_0\\right)^2}{2 s^2}\\right),\n$$\n$$\nL(w; A, r_0, s) = P(w) + R(w; A, r_0, s).\n$$\nThis $L$ has global minima near $w_A = (-1, 0)$ and $w_B = (1, 0)$ due to $P(w)$, while the ring term $R$ creates a curved valley approximately at radius $r_0$.\n\nYour tasks are:\n1) Starting from the fundamental definitions of local minima and saddle points in multivariate calculus—namely, that a differentiable function $L(w)$ has a necessary condition $\\nabla L(w^\\star) = 0$ at any local extremum and that the Hessian $\\nabla^2 L(w^\\star)$ characterizes second-order behavior (positive definite for strict local minima and mixed eigenvalues for saddle points)—propose a homotopy path connecting $w_A$ and $w_B$ using a quadratic weight-space Bézier curve:\n$$\nw(\\alpha) = (1-\\alpha)^2 w_A + 2(1-\\alpha)\\alpha \\, c + \\alpha^2 w_B, \\quad \\alpha \\in [0,1],\n$$\nwhere $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ is a control point.\n2) For a given tuple $(A, r_0, s, c, N)$, discretize the path by evaluating $\\alpha$ on a uniform grid of $N$ points in $[0,1]$, compute $L(w(\\alpha); A, r_0, s)$ at each sampled $\\alpha$, and return the maximum loss barrier along the path defined as\n$$\n\\max_{\\alpha \\in [0,1]} L(w(\\alpha); A, r_0, s) \\;-\\; \\max\\left(L(w_A; A, r_0, s), \\, L(w_B; A, r_0, s)\\right).\n$$\n3) Use your computation to reason about the existence of low-loss connecting paths (mode connectivity) between distinct minima versus the presence of saddles or barriers that obstruct such connections.\n\nImplementation requirements:\n- You must implement the function $L(w; A, r_0, s)$ as defined above without modification.\n- You must fix $w_A = (-1, 0)$ and $w_B = (1, 0)$.\n- You must implement $w(\\alpha)$ exactly as the quadratic Bézier curve given above.\n- Use a uniform discretization of $\\alpha$ with $N$ points, including the endpoints $\\alpha = 0$ and $\\alpha = 1$.\n- The final answer for each test case is a real number (a float) equal to the maximum loss barrier as defined.

This involves defining a path between the minima and calculating the energy barrier along this path. The problem is scientifically and mathematically well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and parameters for a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nFirst, we formalize the components of the loss function $L(w; A, r_0, s)$ for a parameter vector $w = (w_1, w_2)$. The function is a superposition of two terms, $L(w) = P(w) + R(w)$.\n\nThe first term, $P(w)$, is a polynomial designed to create two distinct minima:\n$$\nP(w) = \\left((w_1+1)^2 + w_2^2\\right)\\left((w_1-1)^2 + w_2^2\\right)\n$$\nThis function is zero at the two anchor points $w_A = (-1, 0)$ and $w_B = (1, 0)$, which are intended to be the locations of the minima in the overall loss landscape $L(w)$. Between these points, specifically around the origin $w = (0, 0)$, $P(w)$ creates a potential barrier. For instance, at $w = (0, 0)$, $P(w) = (1)(1) = 1$.\n\nThe second term, $R(w; A, r_0, s)$, introduces a ring-shaped valley of low loss:\n$$\nR(w; A, r_0, s) = -A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\left(\\sqrt{w_1^2 + w_2^2} - r_0\\right)^2}{2 s^2}\\right)\n$$\nHere, $A  0$ determines the depth of the valley, $r_0$ is the radius of the center of the valley, and $s$ controls its width. The loss is maximally reduced (by an amount $-A$) for all points $w$ on the circle of radius $r_0$, i.e., where $\\sqrt{w_1^2 + w_2^2} = r_0$.\n\nThe task is to explore the connectivity between the minima near $w_A$ and $w_B$ by evaluating the loss barrier along a specific family of paths. The paths are defined by a quadratic Bézier curve:\n$$\nw(\\alpha) = (1-\\alpha)^2 w_A + 2(1-\\alpha)\\alpha \\, c + \\alpha^2 w_B, \\quad \\alpha \\in [0,1]\n$$\nThis curve provides a smooth path from $w(0) = w_A$ to $w(1) = w_B$. The shape of the path is governed by the control point $c = (c_x, c_y)$. For $c = (0,0)$, the path is a straight line segment between $w_A$ and $w_B$. For $c$ with $c_y \\neq 0$, the path is a parabola that curves into the $w_2$ dimension, away from the direct line.\n\nThe loss barrier is defined as the maximum loss encountered along the path, minus the loss at the more favorable of the two endpoints:\n$$\n\\text{Barrier} = \\max_{\\alpha \\in [0,1]} L(w(\\alpha)) \\;-\\; \\max\\left(L(w_A), \\, L(w_B)\\right)\n$$\nWe compute this barrier numerically by discretizing the path. We evaluate $w(\\alpha)$ and $L(w(\\alpha))$ for $N$ uniformly spaced values of $\\alpha$ in $[0,1]$ and find the maximum loss among these samples.\n\nFor all test cases, the parameters are set such that $r_0 = 1.0$. The anchor points $w_A = (-1, 0)$ and $w_B = (1, 0)$ both have a radius of $\\sqrt{(\\pm 1)^2 + 0^2} = 1$. Consequently, they lie exactly at the center of the low-loss valley created by $R(w)$. The loss at these endpoints is:\n$P(w_{A,B}) = 0$\n$R(w_{A,B}; A, 1, s) = -A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(1 - 1)^2}{2 s^2}\\right) = -A \\exp(0) = -A$\nThus, $L(w_A) = L(w_B) = -A$. The barrier formula simplifies to:\n$$\n\\text{Barrier} = \\left( \\max_{\\alpha \\in [0,1]} L(w(\\alpha)) \\right) - (-A) = \\left( \\max_{\\alpha \\in [0,1]} L(w(\\alpha)) \\right) + A\n$$\n\nThe provided test cases explore how the barrier changes with the control point $c$.\n- **Case 1**: $c=(0,0)$. The path is a straight line $w(\\alpha) = (2\\alpha-1, 0)$. This path crosses the origin, where $P(w)$ has a local maximum. This is expected to create a significant barrier.\n- **Cases 2  3**: $c=(0, 1.5)$ and $c=(0, 3.0)$. The path becomes a parabola bending \"upwards\". This avoids the origin but moves through regions where $w_2 \\neq 0$. The term $P(w) = ((w_1^2+w_2^2)+1)^2 - 4w_1^2$ generally increases as $|w_2|$ increases (for fixed $w_1$). While curving the path might keep its radius closer to the optimal $r_0=1$, the penalty from the $P(w)$ term can be substantial. Our calculations will reveal which effect dominates.\n- **Case 4**: Uses a different parameter set with a stronger, narrower valley ($A=5.0, s=0.15$) and a control point $c=(0, 1.0)$ that defines a moderately curved path.\n\nThe existence of a low-loss connecting path (mode connectivity) would be indicated by a significantly lower barrier for a curved path (e.g., Case 2) compared to the straight-line path (Case 1). Conversely, if the barrier increases, it suggests that within this family of parabolic paths, the straight line is the most efficient, and a true low-loss \"valley\" does not lie in the direction of these simple curves. The numerical results show that for this specific landscape, increasing the curvature via $c_y$ increases the barrier, suggesting that the barrier of the polynomial term $P(w)$ away from the $w_1$-axis is the dominant factor.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. For each test case $(A, r_0, s, c_x, c_y, N)$, define the vectors $w_A, w_B, c$.\n2. Calculate the baseline endpoint loss, $L_{endpoints\\_max} = -A$.\n3. Generate an array of $N$ values for $\\alpha$ from $0$ to $1$.\n4. For each $\\alpha$, calculate the corresponding path point $w(\\alpha)$ using the vector-valued Bézier formula. This can be done efficiently for all $\\alpha$ values at once using numpy broadcasting.\n5. Calculate the loss $L(w(\\alpha))$ for all points on the path. This can also be fully vectorized.\n6. Find the maximum value in the resulting array of losses, $L_{max\\_path}$.\n7. Compute the barrier as $L_{max\\_path} - L_{endpoints\\_max}$.\n8.
