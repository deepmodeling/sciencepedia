There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n**Part 1: MAP Estimation and Prior Interpretation**\n\nMaximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation seeks the parameters $w$ that maximize the posterior probability of the parameters given the data $\\mathcal{D}$. Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior is:\n$$p(w \\mid \\mathcal{D}) = \\frac{p(\\mathcal{D} \\mid w) p(w)}{p(\\mathcal{D})}$$\nTo find the MAP estimate, $\\hat{w}_{MAP}$, we maximize this quantity with respect to $w$:\n$$\\hat{w}_{MAP} = \\arg\\max_{w} p(w \\mid \\mathcal{D}) = \\arg\\max_{w} \\frac{p(\\mathcal{D} \\mid w) p(w)}{p(\\mathcal{D})}$$\nSince the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function and $p(\\mathcal{D})$ is independent of $w$, this is equivalent to maximizing the log-posterior (excluding the constant term $\\log p(\\mathcal{D})$):\n$$\\hat{w}_{MAP} = \\arg\\max_{w} \\left( \\log p(\\mathcal{D} \\mid w) + \\log p(w) \\right)$$\nAssuming the data points are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), the likelihood term $\\log p(\\mathcal{D} \\mid w)$ can be written as a sum over the training examples:\n$$\\log p(\\mathcal{D} \\mid w) = \\log \\prod_{i=1}^N p(y_i \\mid x_i, w) = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\log p(y_i \\mid x_i, w)$$\nThe MAP estimation problem is then:\n$$\\hat{w}_{MAP} = \\arg\\max_{w} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^N \\log p(y_i \\mid x_i, w) + \\log p(w) \\right)$$\nThis is equivalent to minimizing the negative log-posterior:\n$$\\hat{w}_{MAP} = \\arg\\min_{w} \\left( -\\sum_{i=1}^N \\log p(y_i \\mid x_i, w) - \\log p(w) \\right)$$\nWe are given the training objective to minimize:\n$$\\mathcal{J}(w) = \\sum_{i=1}^N -\\log p(y_i \\mid x_i, w) + \\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\,\\|w\\|_2^2$$\nBy comparing the MAP minimization objective with the given training objective $\\mathcal{J}(w)$, we can equate the terms that depend on $w$ but not the data. This establishes the correspondence between the prior term and the regularization term.\n$$-\\log p(w) = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\|w\\|_2^2 + C$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration (the negative log of the normalization constant of the prior). Rearranging for the prior probability $p(w)$:\n$$\\log p(w) = -\\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\|w\\|_2^2 - C$$\n$$p(w) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\|w\\|_2^2 - C\\right) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\|w\\|_2^2\\right)$$\nThis functional form corresponds to a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The probability density function for a zero-mean multivariate Gaussian $w \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\Sigma)$ is:\n$$p(w) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} w^T \\Sigma^{-1} w\\right)$$\nFor a zero-mean isotropic Gaussian, the covariance matrix is $\\Sigma = \\sigma^2 I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix and $\\sigma^2$ is the variance. Its inverse is $\\Sigma^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} I$. The term in the exponent becomes:\n$$-\\frac{1}{2} w^T (\\sigma^{-2}I) w = -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} w^T w = -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\|w\\|_2^2$$\nEquating the coefficients of $\\|w\\|_2^2$ from the objective function and the Gaussian prior:\n$$\\frac{\\lambda}{2} = \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\implies \\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\implies \\sigma^2 = \\lambda^{-1}$$\nTherefore, the $\\ell_2$ weight decay term corresponds to a zero-mean isotropic Gaussian prior over the weights, $w \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2 I)$, with a variance $\\sigma^2 = \\lambda^{-1}$.\n\n**Part 2: Parameter Count for Convolutional Layer**\n\nA convolutional layer with weight sharing applies the same set of filters across all spatial locations of the input. Each filter has a depth equal to the number of input channels.\n- Filter height, $K_h = 11$.\n- Filter width, $K_w = 11$.\n- Number of input channels, $C_{in} = 3$.\n- Number of filters (which equals the number of output channels), $C_{out} = 96$.\n\nThe total number of weights in the convolutional layer, denoted $W_{conv}$, is the product of these dimensions:\n$$W_{conv} = K_h \\times K_w \\times C_{in} \\times C_{out}$$\n$$W_{conv} = 11 \\times 11 \\times 3 \\times 96 = 121 \\times 3 \\times 96 = 363 \\times 96 = 34{,}848$$\n\n**Part 3: Parameter Count for Locally Connected Layer**\n\nA locally connected layer does not share weights across different spatial positions in the output map. This means for each location in the output feature map, there is a distinct set of weights.\n- Output height, $O_h = 55$.\n- Output width, $O_w = 55$.\nThe number of weights required for one spatial position in the output is the same as the total number of weights in the standard convolutional layer, as it needs a full set of $C_{out}$ filters. More precisely, for each of the $O_h \\times O_w$ output positions and for each of the $C_{out}$ output channels, there is a unique filter of size $K_h \\times K_w \\times C_{in}$.\n\nThe total number of weights in the locally connected layer, $W_{local}$, is:\n$$W_{local} = (O_h \\times O_w) \\times (K_h \\times K_w \\times C_{in} \\times C_{out})$$\n$$W_{local} = (55 \\times 55) \\times (11 \\times 11 \\times 3 \\times 96)$$\n$$W_{local} = 3{,}025 \\times 34{,}848 = 105{,}415{,}200$$\n\n**Part 4: Ratio of Weights**\n\nThe ratio of the number of weights in the locally connected layer to the convolutional layer is:\n$$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{W_{local}}{W_{conv}} = \\frac{(O_h \\times O_w) \\times W_{conv}}{W_{conv}} = O_h \\times O_w$$\n$$\\text{Ratio} = 55 \\times 55 = 3{,}025$$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.

Overfitting is characterized by the validation loss ceasing to decrease and beginning to increase, which corresponds to a change in shape from concave-down to concave-up. In continuous time, this is where the second derivative becomes positive and the first derivative becomes non-negative. In discrete time with epochs, the appropriate approximations are finite differences.\n\nLet $v_t$ denote the validation loss at epoch $t$.

It describes a standard and realistic scenario in the field of distributed deep learning. The provided values for the number of parameters in AlexNet ($N_{p}$), the number of GPUs ($P$), the communication bandwidth ($B$), and the per-GPU computation time ($t_{\\mathrm{comp}}$) are consistent and plausible for high-performance computing systems. The model for ring all-reduce communication and the overall step-time model (computation + communication) are standard and well-defined simplifications used for performance analysis. The definition of parallel efficiency is a standard one for weak-scaling analysis. The problem is self-contained and free of internal contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be developed.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe solution requires calculating the parallel efficiency $E$. This involves determining the total time for a single training step with $P$ GPUs, $T(P)$, and with a single GPU, $T(1)$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total size $S$ of the gradient vector that must be synchronized across all GPUs in each step. The network has $N_p = 61{,}000{,}000$ trainable parameters, and each parameter's gradient is represented by a $4$-byte single-precision floating-point number.\n$$S = N_p \\times 4 \\text{ bytes} = 61{,}000{,}000 \\times 4 = 244{,}000{,}000 \\text{ bytes}$$\nThis can be expressed in scientific notation as $S = 2.44 \\times 10^8$ bytes.\n\nSecond, we calculate the communication time, $t_{\\mathrm{comm}}$, required for the ring all-reduce operation. The algorithm proceeds in $2(P-1)$ sequential communication steps. In each step, a data chunk of size $\\frac{S}{P}$ is sent over a point-to-point link. The time for one such step is the chunk size divided by the bandwidth $B$. Since the steps are sequential and latency is ignored, the total communication time is the sum of the times for each step:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{comm}} = (\\text{Number of steps}) \\times (\\text{Time per step}) = 2(P-1) \\times \\frac{S/P}{B} = \\frac{2(P-1)S}{PB}$$\nWe substitute the given values: $P = 8$, $S = 2.44 \\times 10^8$ bytes, and $B = 3.125 \\times 10^9$ bytes/s.\n$$t_{\\mathrm{comm}} = \\frac{2(8-1)(2.44 \\times 10^8)}{8 \\times (3.125 \\times 10^9)} = \\frac{14 \\times 2.44 \\times 10^8}{25 \\times 10^9}$$\n$$t_{\\mathrm{comm}} = \\frac{34.16 \\times 10^8}{25 \\times 10^9} = \\frac{3.416 \\times 10^9}{2.5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.13664 \\text{ s}$$\n\nThird, we compute the parallel efficiency $E$. The total time for one training step on $P$ GPUs, $T(P)$, is the sum of the computation time and communication time, as there is no overlap.\n$$T(P) = t_{\\mathrm{comp}} + t_{\\mathrm{comm}}$$\nThe time for a training step on a single GPU, $T(1)$, involves only computation, as no inter-GPU communication is needed. Thus, $t_{\\mathrm{comm}}(P=1) = 0$.\n$$T(1) = t_{\\mathrm{comp}}$$\nParallel efficiency $E$ is defined as the ratio of achieved throughput to ideal throughput. Let $B_0$ be the constant per-GPU mini-batch size.\nAchieved throughput at $P$ GPUs is $\\text{Throughput}(P) = \\frac{\\text{Total samples per step}}{\\text{Time per step}} = \\frac{P \\cdot B_0}{T(P)}$.\nThe ideal throughput at $P$ GPUs is $P$ times the throughput of a single GPU: $\\text{Ideal Throughput}(P) = P \\times \\text{Throughput}(1) = P \\times \\frac{1 \\cdot B_0}{T(1)}$.\nThe efficiency $E$ is the ratio:\n$$E = \\frac{\\text{Throughput}(P)}{\\text{Ideal Throughput}(P)} = \\frac{P \\cdot B_0 / T(P)}{P \\cdot B_0 / T(1)} = \\frac{T(1)}{T(P)}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $T(1)$ and $T(P)$:\n$$E = \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{comp}}}{t_{\\mathrm{comp}} + t_{\\mathrm{comm}}}$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values $t_{\\mathrm{comp}} = 0.080$ s and our calculated $t_{\\mathrm{comm}} = 0.13664$ s:\n$$E = \\frac{0.080}{0.080 + 0.13664} = \\frac{0.080}{0.21664} \\approx 0.3692762...$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$E \\approx 0.3693$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3693}$$", "id": "3118605"}]}
