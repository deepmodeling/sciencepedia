Assume the following conditions hold at initialization:\n- The input components are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with zero mean and variance $\\operatorname{Var}(x_{i}) = 1$.\n- All biases are zero.\n- The nonlinearity is smooth and is linearized around zero at initialization so that its local gain is approximately $1$.\n- Each weight matrix $W^{(\\ell)}$ is initialized with independent entries drawn from a zero-mean uniform distribution supported on the symmetric interval $\\left[-a_{\\ell}, a_{\\ell}\\right]$.\n- Independence approximations apply so that covariances between distinct terms vanish when propagating variances forward and backward.\n\nThe design goal is to choose the weight variance so that, under the linearized and independence assumptions, the scale of signals is balanced in both the forward and backward directions.

It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of deep learning, specifically concerning weight initialization and its impact on signal propagation. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters, definitions, and a clear, objective criterion for success. It is free of contradictions, ambiguities, and factual errors. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe objective is to empirically verify the conditions under which the variance of pre-activations, $z^{(l)}$, is preserved across the layers of a deep neural network. The core of this analysis lies in the recursive relationship between the variance of pre-activations in successive layers.\n\nLet us consider a single neuron's pre-activation at layer $l$:\n$$ z_i^{(l)} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n_{l-1}} W_{ij}^{(l)} a_j^{(l-1)} $$\nHere, $W_{ij}^{(l)}$ is the weight connecting neuron $j$ of layer $l-1$ to neuron $i$ of layer $l$, and $a_j^{(l-1)}$ is the activation of neuron $j$ from the previous layer. The problem specifies that biases are zero, weights $W_{ij}^{(l)}$ are drawn from a distribution with zero mean, and the input components $x_j$ (which constitute $a_j^{(0)}$) also have zero mean. We assume that at initialization, the activations $a_j^{(l-1)}$ for all $j$ are independent of the weights $W_{ij}^{(l)}$ and are identically distributed. Furthermore, if the activations $a^{(l-1)}$ are the output of a symmetric activation function applied to zero-mean inputs $z^{(l-1)}$, they will also have zero mean. For the $\\mathrm{ReLU}$ activation, this is not the case, but the resulting pre-activations $z^{(l)}$ will still have zero mean because the weights themselves are zero-mean: $\\mathbb{E}[z_i^{(l)}] = \\sum_j \\mathbb{E}[W_{ij}^{(l)}] \\mathbb{E}[a_j^{(l-1)}] = \\sum_j 0 \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[a_j^{(l-1)}] = 0$.\n\nUnder these conditions, the variance of $z_i^{(l)}$ is given by:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(z_i^{(l)}) = \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{l-1}} W_{ij}^{(l)} a_j^{(l-1)}\\right) $$\nDue to the independence of the terms in the sum (as weights and previous layer activations are independent), the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(z_i^{(l)}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n_{l-1}} \\operatorname{Var}(W_{ij}^{(l)} a_j^{(l-1)}) $$\nFor two independent random variables $U$ and $V$ with at least one having zero mean (e.g., $\\mathbb{E}[U]=0$), $\\operatorname{Var}(UV) = \\mathbb{E}[U^2V^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[UV])^2 = \\mathbb{E}[U^2]\\mathbb{E}[V^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[U]\\mathbb{E}[V])^2 = \\operatorname{Var}(U)\\operatorname{Var}(V)$. Since $\\mathbb{E}[W_{ij}^{(l)}] = 0$, we have:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(z_i^{(l)}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n_{l-1}} \\operatorname{Var}(W_{ij}^{(l)}) \\operatorname{Var}(a_j^{(l-1)}) $$\nAssuming all weights in layer $l$ are drawn i.i.d. with variance $\\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)})$ and all activations from layer $l-1$ are i.i.d. with variance $\\operatorname{Var}(a^{(l-1)})$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(z^{(l)}) = n_{l-1} \\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)}) \\operatorname{Var}(a^{(l-1)}) $$\nwhere $n_{l-1}$ is the number of neurons in layer $l-1$. To maintain stable signal propagation, we require the variance to be preserved, i.e., $\\operatorname{Var}(z^{(l)}) \\approx \\operatorname{Var}(z^{(l-1)})$. This requires a careful choice of the weight initialization variance, $\\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)})$, to counteract the effect of the activation function $\\phi$ on the variance, which is captured by the term $\\operatorname{Var}(a^{(l-1)}) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\phi(z^{(l-1)}))$.\n\n**Activation Function Analysis**\n\n1.  **$\\tanh$ Activation:** The hyperbolic tangent function, $\\tanh(z)$, is symmetric around the origin ($\\tanh(0)=0$) and behaves like the identity function for small inputs ($\\tanh(z) \\approx z$ for $z \\approx 0$). If we assume the pre-activations $z^{(l-1)}$ are concentrated around zero, which is a desirable state during initial training phases, then $\\operatorname{Var}(a^{(l-1)}) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\tanh(z^{(l-1)})) \\approx \\operatorname{Var}(z^{(l-1)})$. Substituting this into our propagation equation yields:\n    $$ \\operatorname{Var}(z^{(l)}) \\approx n_{l-1} \\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)}) \\operatorname{Var}(z^{(l-1)}) $$\n    To achieve $\\operatorname{Var}(z^{(l)}) \\approx \\operatorname{Var}(z^{(l-1)})$, we must set $n_{l-1} \\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)}) = 1$.\n    **Xavier (Glorot) normal initialization** is designed precisely for this situation. It sets the variance of the weights $W^{(l)}$ drawn from $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$ as:\n    $$ \\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)}) = \\frac{2}{n_{l-1} + n_l} $$\n    In our specific problem, $n_{l-1} = n_l = n$, so this becomes $\\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)}) = \\frac{2}{2n} = \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{n_{l-1}}$. This choice perfectly satisfies the condition $n_{l-1} \\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)}) = 1$. Thus, Xavier initialization is expected to preserve variance for the $\\tanh$ activation function.\n\n2.  **$\\mathrm{ReLU}$ Activation:** The Rectified Linear Unit, $\\mathrm{ReLU}(z) = \\max(0, z)$, is not symmetric. For a zero-mean, symmetric input distribution for $z^{(l-1)}$ (like a Gaussian), exactly half of the inputs will be set to zero. This affects the variance. Let $z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_z^2)$. The variance of the output $a = \\mathrm{ReLU}(z)$ is $\\operatorname{Var}(a) = \\mathbb{E}[a^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[a])^2$.\n    The expectation of the squared activation is $\\mathbb{E}[a^2] = \\mathbb{E}[\\max(0, z)^2] = \\int_0^\\infty z^2 p(z) dz$. Due to the symmetry of the normal distribution $p(z)$, this integral is half of the total integral for $z^2$: $\\mathbb{E}[a^2] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z^2 p(z) dz = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{E}[z^2] = \\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{Var}(z)$.\n    So, for $\\mathrm{ReLU}$, we have $\\operatorname{Var}(a^{(l-1)}) \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{Var}(z^{(l-1)})$. The variance propagation equation becomes:\n    $$ \\operatorname{Var}(z^{(l)}) \\approx n_{l-1} \\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)}) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{Var}(z^{(l-1)})\\right) $$\n    To preserve variance, we must have $n_{l-1} \\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)}) \\frac{1}{2} = 1$, which implies $\\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)}) = \\frac{2}{n_{l-1}}$.\n    **He (Kaiming) normal initialization** is designed for this case. It sets the variance as:\n    $$ \\operatorname{Var}(W^{(l)}) = \\frac{2}{n_{l-1}} $$\n    This choice satisfies the condition exactly. Therefore, He initialization is expected to preserve variance for the $\\mathrm{ReLU}$ activation function. Mismatched pairs (e.g., $\\tanh$ with He, $\\mathrm{ReLU}$ with Xavier) are predicted to lead to exploding or vanishing variances, respectively.\n\n**Simulation Procedure**\n\nThe program will implement a Monte Carlo simulation for each of the $8$ test cases. For each case:\n1.  A pseudo-random number generator is seeded with the value $12345$ to ensure reproducibility.\n2.  An input data matrix $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{s \\times n}$ is generated, where each element is drawn from $\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. The empirical input variance, $\\widehat{\\operatorname{Var}}(x)$, is calculated using the provided formula.\n3.  The network is processed layer by layer, from $l=1$ to $L$. In each layer, the weight matrix $W^{(l)}$ is initialized from a zero-mean normal distribution with the variance dictated by the specified strategy (Xavier or He).\n4.  The pre-activations $z^{(l)} = a^{(l-1)} W^{(l)}$ are computed.\n5.  The empirical variance $\\widehat{\\operatorname{Var}}(z^{(l)})$ is computed. The relative deviation $\\delta^{(l)} = |\\widehat{\\operatorname{Var}}(z^{(l)}) - \\widehat{\\operatorname{Var}}(x)| / \\widehat{\\operatorname{Var}}(x)$ is calculated.\n6.  The maximum relative deviation across all layers, $\\max_{1 \\le l \\le L} \\delta^{(l)}$, is tracked.\n7.  The post-activations $a^{(l)} = \\phi(z^{(l)})$ are computed to serve as input for the next layer.\n8.  After iterating through all layers, the test case is deemed to preserve variance if $\\max_{l} \\delta^{(l)} \\le \\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon = 0.25$.

By analyzing a layer with a very small fan-in, you will derive the resulting weight bound and reason about its consequences, such as the risk of neuron saturation with functions like $\\tanh$ [@problem_id:3200103]. This exercise sharpens your critical thinking about when theoretical models must be applied with practical caution.", "problem": "Consider a single fully connected layer in a deep neural network with hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation. The layer maps an input vector to an output vector. Let the number of inputs to one neuron be $\\mathrm{fan}_{in}$ and the number of outputs from one input be $\\mathrm{fan}_{out}$. Assume the following fundamental base:\n\n- Inputs $x$ to the layer are independent and identically distributed with zero mean and unit variance, i.e., $\\operatorname{E}[x] = 0$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(x) = 1$.\n- Upstream gradient signals $g$ at the layer’s outputs during backpropagation are independent and identically distributed with zero mean and unit variance, i.e., $\\operatorname{E}[g] = 0$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(g) = 1$.\n- Weights $w$ in the layer are independent, zero-mean, and sampled uniformly from the interval $[-a, a]$, i.e., $w \\sim \\mathcal{U}(-a, a)$, so that $\\operatorname{Var}(w) = a^{2}/3$.\n- Pre-activations $z$ are linear combinations $z = \\sum w x$, and near the origin the hyperbolic tangent behaves approximately linearly, so the local gradient factor from the activation does not alter variance at leading order.\n- Independence assumptions apply so that for sums of independent zero-mean terms, variances add without cross terms.\n\nUsing only the above, enforce variance preservation symmetrically across forward and backward passes by requiring that the arithmetic mean of the forward pre-activation variance and the backward input-gradient variance equals the corresponding input or gradient variance target. Concretely, demand that\n$$\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\operatorname{Var}(z)\\;+\\;\\operatorname{Var}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x}\\right)\\right) \\;=\\; 1,$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}$ denotes the loss function.

Then, briefly explain (qualitatively, not quantitatively) why such a bound can be considered “large” for a saturating nonlinearity like tanh and how clipping the initialization interval $[-a, a]$ could mitigate saturation and optimizer instability.\n\nProvide your final answer as the single exact expression for $a$ in the $\\mathrm{fan}_{in} = 1$, $\\mathrm{fan}_{out} = 1$ case.

Let $x$ denote inputs with $\\operatorname{E}[x] = 0$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(x) = 1$, and let weights $w$ be independent, zero-mean, uniformly distributed in $[-a, a]$ so that $\\operatorname{Var}(w) = a^{2}/3$. For a neuron, the pre-activation is\n$$z \\;=\\; \\sum_{i=1}^{\\mathrm{fan}_{in}} w_{i}\\, x_{i}.$$\nUnder independence and zero mean, the variance of a sum of independent zero-mean terms is the sum of variances, and each term has variance $\\operatorname{Var}(w)\\operatorname{Var}(x)$.

Let $g_{j} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial z_{j}}$ denote upstream gradients at the layer’s pre-activations, with $\\operatorname{E}[g_{j}] = 0$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(g_{j}) = 1$.

For tanh, when the pre-activation $z$ has $|z| \\gtrsim 2$, the derivative $\\phi'(z) = 1 - \\tanh^{2}(z)$ becomes very small, diminishing gradient flow. Sampling weights from $[-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3}]$ coupled with unit-variance inputs leads to pre-activations $z = w x$ that frequently take large magnitudes, pushing the activation into saturation. Saturation reduces effective gradients and can cause unstable or slow training for optimizers such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), particularly when gradient signals vanish or become highly variable across units. Clipping the initialization interval to a smaller $[-a', a']$ with $a'  \\sqrt{3}$ reduces the likelihood of saturating pre-activations at the start of training, thereby improving gradient flow and mitigating optimizer instability in this edge case of tiny $\\mathrm{fan}_{in}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{3}}$$", "id": "3200103"}]}
