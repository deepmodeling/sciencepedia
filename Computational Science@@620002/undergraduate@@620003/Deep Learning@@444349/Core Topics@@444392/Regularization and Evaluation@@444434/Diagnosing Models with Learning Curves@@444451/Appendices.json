The concepts of ERM, cross-entropy loss, overparameterization, label noise, and the phenomenon of memorization are central to modern machine learning research. The observed loss curves are qualitatively and quantitatively realistic and consistent with published findings on the dynamics of deep networks trained on noisy labels.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data and a clear directive. The task is to interpret the provided learning curves in the context of a standard theoretical framework (early learning of patterns, later memorization of noise). A unique and meaningful analysis is possible.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective language and numerical data. It is free from subjective claims or ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in the analysis of deep learning models. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe core task is to diagnose the model's behavior by analyzing its learning curves, which plot training loss ($L_{\\text{train}}$) and validation loss ($L_{\\text{val}}$) as a function of training epochs ($e$).\n\n1.  **Generalization vs. Memorization**: An effective model generalizes well from the training data to unseen data. The validation loss, $L_{\\text{val}}$, measured on a clean, held-out dataset, is a proxy for the model's generalization error. The training loss, $L_{\\text{train}}$, measures how well the model fits the training data.\n2.  **Signature of Overfitting/Memorization**: An overparameterized model has sufficient capacity to memorize the training data, including any noise or mislabeled examples. The provided assumption states that models first learn general patterns (beneficial for both training and validation sets) and later begin to memorize idiosyncratic data points, such as those with corrupt labels. This phenomenon manifests in the learning curves as follows:\n    - $L_{\\text{train}}$ continues to decrease as the model fits the training data, including the noise, more and more perfectly.\n    - $L_{\\text{val}}$ first decreases (as the model learns generalizable features) and then begins to *increase* as the model's parameters are adjusted to fit the noise in the training set, which harms its ability to generalize to the clean validation set.\n3.  **Early Stopping**: The goal of early stopping is to halt training at the point where the model achieves the best generalization performance. This corresponds to the epoch where $L_{\\text{val}}$ reaches its minimum value. The epoch at which $L_{\\text{val}}$ is minimized is the optimal stopping point, and the subsequent increase in $L_{\\text{val}}$ marks the onset of detrimental overfitting or memorization of noise.\n\nWe now apply this framework to analyze the data for each noise rate $p$.\n\n- **Analysis for $p=0$ (no noise)**:\n  - $L_{\\text{train}}(e)$ decreases monotonically from $1.00$ to $0.25$.\n  - $L_{\\text{val}}(e)$ decreases monotonically from $1.02$ to $0.30$.\n  - Since $L_{\\text{val}}(e)$ is always decreasing over the observed $10$ epochs, there is no evidence of overfitting. The model is still improving its generalization performance. The best model within this training duration is at $e=10$.\n\n- **Analysis for $p=0.1$ ($10\\%$ noise)**:\n  - $L_{\\text{train}}(e)$ decreases monotonically from $1.00$ to $0.39$.\n  - $L_{\\text{val}}(e)$ sequence is $\\{1.04, 0.86, 0.72, 0.63, 0.58, \\mathbf{0.56}, 0.57, 0.60, 0.64, 0.69\\}$.\n  - $L_{\\text{val}}(e)$ decreases until epoch $e=6$, where it reaches a minimum of $0.56$, and then begins to increase. This characteristic U-shape is the classic sign of overfitting. The model starts memorizing the noisy labels after $e=6$, which degrades its performance on the clean validation set. The optimal early stopping point is $e=6$.\n\n- **Analysis for $p=0.4$ ($40\\%$ noise)**:\n  - $L_{\\text{train}}(e)$ decreases monotonically from $1.00$ to $0.63$.\n  - $L_{\\text{val}}(e)$ sequence is $\\{1.10, 0.96, 0.90, \\mathbf{0.89}, 0.91, 0.95, 1.00, 1.07, 1.16, 1.26\\}$.\n  - $L_{\\text{val}}(e)$ decreases until epoch $e=4$, where it reaches a minimum of $0.89$, and then increases sharply. The onset of memorization occurs earlier and is more severe compared to the $p=0.1$ case. The optimal early stopping point is $e=4$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For $p=0$, there is no evidence of memorization within $10$ epochs because $L_{\\text{val}}(e)$ decreases monotonically; a reasonable early stopping choice is $e=10$ among the given epochs.**\n- **Analysis**: The data for $p=0$ shows that $L_{\\text{val}}(e)$ is a strictly decreasing sequence over the $10$ epochs. This confirms that no overfitting/memorization has occurred within this time frame. The model with the best generalization performance is the one with the lowest $L_{\\text{val}}$, which occurs at the last observed epoch, $e=10$. The statement is a correct interpretation of the data.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. For $p=0.1$, memorization begins around the epoch where $L_{\\text{val}}(e)$ attains its minimum and then increases while $L_{\\text{train}}(e)$ continues to decrease; a reasonable early stopping choice is $e=6$.**\n- **Analysis**: For $p=0.1$, the data shows $L_{\\text{train}}(e)$ is monotonically decreasing. The validation loss $L_{\\text{val}}(e)$ reaches its minimum at $e=6$ with $L_{\\text{val}}(6) = 0.56$. After this epoch, $L_{\\text{val}}(e)$ increases, indicating the onset of memorization of noisy labels. Therefore, stopping at $e=6$ is the standard and correct early stopping strategy.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**C. For $p=0.4$, memorization begins earlier than for $p=0.1$; a reasonable early stopping choice is $e=4$.**\n- **Analysis**: For $p=0.4$, the onset of memorization (minimum of $L_{\\text{val}}$) is at epoch $e=4$. For $p=0.1$, it is at epoch $e=6$. Since $4 < 6$, memorization does indeed begin earlier for the higher noise rate. The epoch $e=4$ corresponds to the minimum $L_{\\text{val}}$ for $p=0.4$, making it the correct early stopping point.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**D. A universally reliable rule is to stop at the earliest epoch where training accuracy exceeds validation accuracy.**\n- **Analysis**: This statement proposes a rule based on accuracy. In terms of loss (which is provided), the analogous rule would be to stop at the earliest epoch where $L_{\\text{train}}(e) < L_{\\text{val}}(e)$. Let's examine this rule with our data:\n    - For $p=0.1$, $L_{\\text{train}}(e) < L_{\\text{val}}(e)$ for all epochs $e \\ge 1$. This rule would suggest stopping at $e=1$, which yields a suboptimal model ($L_{\\text{val}}(1)=1.04$) compared to the best model at $e=6$ ($L_{\\text{val}}(6)=0.56$).\n    - For $p=0.4$, the same holds: $L_{\\text{train}}(e) < L_{\\text{val}}(e)$ for all $e \\ge 1$. The rule again incorrectly suggests stopping at $e=1$.\nThe condition that training performance is better than validation performance is typical throughout training and does not, by itself, indicate the optimal stopping point. The reliable indicator is the *turning point* of the validation loss curve, not the point where it crosses the training loss curve. Therefore, the proposed rule is not reliable.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. As $p$ increases, the onset of memorization shifts earlier in training, so the onset epoch satisfies $e_{\\text{onset}}(p=0.4) < e_{\\text{onset}}(p=0.1) < e_{\\text{onset}}(p=0)$ under the observed curves.**\n- **Analysis**: We define the onset epoch, $e_{\\text{onset}}$, as the epoch where $L_{\\text{val}}(e)$ is minimized.\n    - For $p=0.4$, $e_{\\text{onset}}(p=0.4) = 4$.\n    - For $p=0.1$, $e_{\\text{onset}}(p=0.1) = 6$.\n    - For $p=0$, $L_{\\text{val}}(e)$ is monotonically decreasing for all $10$ epochs, so the onset of memorization has not yet occurred. We can thus state that $e_{\\text{onset}}(p=0) > 10$.\nChecking the inequality: $e_{\\text{onset}}(p=0.4) = 4 < e_{\\text{onset}}(p=0.1) = 6$. The first part is true. And since $e_{\\text{onset}}(p=0) > 10$, it is also true that $e_{\\text{onset}}(p=0.1) = 6 < e_{\\text{onset}}(p=0)$. The entire chain of inequalities holds based on the provided data. This is consistent with the theoretical understanding that a higher proportion of noise exhausts the \"easy\" learnable patterns more quickly, forcing the model to start memorizing the noisy labels at an earlier epoch.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCE}$$", "id": "3115462"}, {"introduction": "Data augmentation is a powerful tool, but only when the transformations are label-preserving.

The observed phenomena are plausible and represent a classic diagnostic challenge.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides sufficient, consistent data to allow for a logical diagnosis.

It presents a realistic and non-trivial diagnostic task in applied deep learning.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds by interpreting the provided learning curve data in the context of the training setup.\n\n1.  **Baseline Analysis (No Augmentation)**: The baseline condition shows a healthy learning trend. Both $L_{\\text{train}}$ and $L_{\\text{val}}$ decrease, indicating the model is learning meaningful patterns. The final state, $L_{\\text{val}}(50) = 0.80 > L_{\\text{train}}(50) = 0.60$, shows a small generalization gap ($0.20$), which is expected and indicates that the model is fitting the training data slightly better than the validation data, but is still generalizing well.\n\n2.  **Augmentation Analysis**: The augmentation condition presents a starkly different picture.\n    - The final training loss, $L_{\\text{train}}(50) = 0.40$, is lower than the baseline's training loss. This suggests the model has sufficient capacity to learn from the augmented data, and the augmentation acts as a regularizer, pushing the model to find a more robust solution that achieves a lower loss on the difficult, augmented training set.\n    - The validation loss, $L_{\\text{val}}$, not only ends up higher than in the baseline ($1.10$ vs $0.80$) but also *increases* over time. This is a critical symptom. The model is learning features from the augmented training data that are actively detrimental to its performance on the original, un-augmented validation data. The generalization gap is large and growing ($1.10 - 0.40 = 0.70$).\n\n3.  **Identifying the Causal Factor**: The central premise of the problem is that the classification task is based on **dominant color**. The applied augmentation includes **random hue shifts up to $\\pm 180^\\circ$**. A hue shift of $180^\\circ$ transforms a color into its complement (e.g., red becomes cyan, green becomes magenta, blue becomes yellow).\n\n    Data augmentation is effective when the transformations are **label-invariant**. That is, for a transformation $T$ and an input-label pair $(x, y)$, the label of the transformed input $T(x)$ should remain $y$. In this problem, if an image $x$ with a dominant red color has the label $y = \\text{\"red\"}$, applying a $180^\\circ$ hue shift creates a new image $T(x)$ with a dominant cyan color. However, the augmentation pipeline retains the original label, training the model on the pair $(T(x), y) = (\\text{cyan image}, \\text{\"red\"})$.\n\n    This violates the principle of label invariance. The model is being trained on a distribution where the relationship between color and label is systematically corrupted. To minimize training loss, the model must learn to either ignore color information or learn a nonsensical mapping (e.g., that \"red\" can mean both red and cyan). When this model is evaluated on the validation set, where color is the primary predictive feature, its performance is poor and degrades as it further internalizes the flawed patterns from the training set.\n\n4.  **Confirming with Parametric Analysis**: The additional observation regarding the parameter $\\alpha$ for hue shift intensity provides conclusive evidence. As $\\alpha$ increases, the hue shifts become more extreme, increasing the violation of label invariance. This directly corresponds to a *decrease* in final training loss (the regularization effect becomes stronger) and an *increase* in final validation loss (the semantic mismatch between training and validation worsens). This directly links the hue shift transformation to the observed pathological learning behavior.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The train-time augmentation includes transformations $T$ for which label invariance does not hold, so the augmented training distribution differs in label semantics from the validation distribution. Remove or constrain such non-invariant transforms (for example, eliminate large hue shifts), then re-run learning curves.**\n- **Justification**: This explanation correctly identifies the root cause: the large hue shifts are not a label-preserving transformation for a color-based classification task. This creates a fundamental mismatch in the conditional probability distribution $P(Y|X)$ between the augmented training data and the original validation data. The proposed solutionâ€”to remove or constrain the offending transformationâ€”is the logically correct next step to remedy the problem.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The model is underfitting; increase model capacity (for example, more layers or wider layers) to reduce both training and validation losses.**\n- **Justification**: This diagnosis is incorrect. A key sign of underfitting is a high training loss, indicating the model cannot even fit the training data. Here, the final training loss in the augmentation case is very low ($0.40$), lower than the baseline. This demonstrates that the model has ample capacity to fit the training data. The problem is one of poor generalization due to a data mismatch, not a lack of model capacity.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The learning rate is too large; reduce it so the training is more stable, which will lower validation loss while keeping training loss low.**\n- **Justification**: An overly large learning rate typically causes unstable or divergent training loss. The problem describes a training loss that decreases smoothly to a very low value, which is not characteristic of an excessive learning rate. While tuning the learning rate is a standard practice, it is not the primary cause of a fundamental semantic mismatch introduced by the data augmentation pipeline. The evidence points to a data problem, not an optimization problem.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The issue is solely covariate shift from applying augmentation only at training time; enable the same augmentation at validation and test time so the distributions match and the validation loss aligns with the training loss.**\n- **Justification**: This is a misunderstanding of the goal of validation. While applying the same augmentations at validation time would make the input distributions $P(X)$ match and likely cause the validation loss to decrease, it would be measuring the model's performance on a nonsensical task (e.g., classifying cyan images as \"red\"). The purpose of a validation set is to estimate the model's performance on the *true, unmodified data distribution* that it will encounter in production. This proposed \"fix\" merely hides the underlying problem by redefining the validation task to be as flawed as the training task, leading to a model that is useless for its intended purpose. The issue is not merely covariate shift, but a more severe problem with the conditional label distribution.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3115497"}, {"introduction": "The initial epochs of training are critical for stability and setting the stage for effective learning.

Declare delayed progress if $f_{\\text{early}} \\lt \\rho$ with $\\rho = 0.2$.\n- Classification rule, applied in this order:\n  - If initial divergence is detected in the early window, classify as under-warmup and output $-1$.\n  - Else if delayed progress is detected, classify as over-warmup and output $1$.\n  - Else classify as acceptable warmup and output $0$.\n\nSimulation details:\n- Initialize with $x_{0}$ and compute $y_{0} = L(x_{0})$.\n- For each epoch $t = 1, 2, \\dots, T$:\n  - Compute $\\eta_{t} = \\eta_{\\max} \\cdot \\min\\!\\left(\\frac{t}{w}, 1\\right)$.\n  - Update $x_{t} = x_{t-1} - \\eta_{t} a x_{t-1}$.\n  - Compute $y_{t} = \\frac{1}{2} a x_{t}^{2} + \\sigma \\sin\\!\\left( \\frac{2 \\pi t}{P} \\right)$.\n\nTest suite:\nProvide outputs for the following parameter sets. Each case is a tuple $(a, \\eta_{\\max}, w, T, x_{0}, \\sigma, P)$:\n- Case A (expected to probe initial divergence with extremely short warmup): $(10.0, 0.25, 1, 40, 1.0, 0.0, 7)$.\n- Case B (expected acceptable warmup with safe maximum learning rate and short warmup): $(10.0, 0.15, 3, 40, 1.0, 0.0, 7)$.\n- Case C (expected delayed progress with very long warmup): $(10.0, 0.18, 300, 500, 1.0, 0.0, 7)$.\n- Case D (boundary stability at the edge of the classical step-size stability limit after warmup): $(10.0, 0.20, 5, 40, 1.0, 0.0, 7)$.\n- Case E (expected initial divergence at the end of warmup with too-high maximum learning rate): $(12.0, 0.25, 5, 50, 1.0, 0.0, 7)$.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the order of the test suite above. Each entry must be an integer in $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ representing the class for that case, so the output must look like $[r_{A}, r_{B}, r_{C}, r_{D}, r_{E}]$.\n\nNotes:\n- There are no physical units in this problem.\n- Angles in the sine term are in radians by construction of the argument $\\frac{2 \\pi t}{P}$.\n- Percentages must be expressed as decimals, and all thresholds $\\tau$, $\\rho$, and $\\varepsilon$ are provided numerically.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is determined to be sound. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of numerical optimization, specifically gradient descent on a convex quadratic function. The problem is well-posed, with all parameters, equations, and diagnostic criteria explicitly and unambiguously defined. The setup is self-contained and internally consistent, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nThe task is to simulate the training dynamics of a one-dimensional parameter $x$ under gradient descent and classify the behavior of the learning rate warmup schedule. The process involves several interconnected components: the mathematical model of optimization, the learning rate schedule, the simulation of training loss, and a set of diagnostic rules.\n\nFirst, we establish the core optimization model. The loss function is a simple convex quadratic, $L(x) = \\frac{1}{2} a x^2$, where $a > 0$ is the curvature. The gradient of this loss function with respect to the parameter $x$ is $\\nabla L(x) = a x$. The gradient descent update rule modifies the parameter $x$ at each epoch $t$ according to the equation $x_{t} = x_{t-1} - \\eta_{t} \\nabla L(x_{t-1})$, where $\\eta_t$ is the learning rate at epoch $t$. Substituting the gradient, the specific update rule is:\n$$x_{t} = x_{t-1} - \\eta_{t} a x_{t-1} = x_{t-1}(1 - \\eta_{t} a)$$\nThis update is performed for epochs $t = 1, 2, \\dots, T$.\n\nThe learning rate $\\eta_t$ follows a linear warmup schedule. For a total warmup duration of $w$ epochs and a target maximum learning rate of $\\eta_{\\max}$, the learning rate at epoch $t$ is given by:\n$$\\eta_{t} = \\eta_{\\max} \\cdot \\min\\left(\\frac{t}{w}, 1\\right)$$\nThis means $\\eta_t$ increases linearly from $\\eta_1 = \\eta_{\\max}/w$ to $\\eta_w = \\eta_{\\max}$ for $t \\le w$. For all subsequent epochs $t > w$, the learning rate remains constant at $\\eta_t = \\eta_{\\max}$.\n\nThe simulation must track the training loss over the epochs. The problem defines an observed loss, $y_t$, which consists of the true loss $L(x_t)$ plus a deterministic sinusoidal noise term. The initial loss is $y_0 = L(x_0)$. For subsequent epochs $t \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, T\\}$, the observed loss is:\n$$y_t = L(x_t) + \\sigma \\sin\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi t}{P}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} a x_t^2 + \\sigma \\sin\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi t}{P}\\right)$$\nThe simulation proceeds as follows:\n1. Initialize the parameter $x_0$ and compute the initial loss $y_0 = \\frac{1}{2} a x_0^2$. Store all loss values $y_t$ in an array.\n2. For each epoch $t$ from $1$ to $T$:\n   a. Calculate the learning rate $\\eta_t$ using the warmup schedule.\n   b. Update the parameter to get $x_t$ using the gradient descent rule.\n   c. Compute the observed loss $y_t$ and store it.\n\nAfter the simulation is complete, we apply a sequence of diagnostic tests to the generated learning curve $\\{y_t\\}_{t=0}^T$.\n\nThe first diagnostic is for **early-epoch stability**. This test checks for initial divergence, a common symptom of an overly aggressive learning rate (i.e., under-warmup). We define an early window of $K = \\min(5, T)$ epochs. Initial divergence is detected if the loss increases by more than a relative threshold $\\tau = 0.1$ at any point within this window. That is, if there exists any $t \\in \\{1, \\dots, K\\}$ such that:\n$$y_t > (1 + \\tau) y_{t-1}$$\nIf this condition is met, the warmup is classified as `under-warmup` ($-1$).\n\nIf no initial divergence is found, the second diagnostic is for **delayed progress**. This test checks for an overly conservative learning rate (i.e., over-warmup), which causes the model to learn too slowly at the beginning. We quantify the fraction of the total loss reduction that occurs within the early window of $K$ epochs:\n$$f_{\\text{early}} = \\frac{y_0 - y_K}{\\max(y_0 - y_T, \\varepsilon)}$$\nHere, $\\varepsilon = 10^{-12}$ is a small constant to prevent division by zero if the loss does not decrease from epoch $0$ to $T$. If this fraction is below a threshold $\\rho = 0.2$, we declare delayed progress. The warmup is then classified as `over-warmup` ($1$).\n\nThe final classification follows a strict order.\n1. If initial divergence is detected, the result is $-1$.\n2. Otherwise, if delayed progress is detected, the result is $1$.\n3. Otherwise, the warmup is considered `acceptable`, and the result is $0$.\n\nThis procedure is applied to each test case provided. The implementation will systematically execute the simulation and apply the defined diagnostics to produce the final classification for each set of parameters.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates training dynamics to diagnose learning rate warmup for several test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A: (a, eta_max, w, T, x0, sigma, P)\n        (10.0, 0.25, 1, 40, 1.0, 0.0, 7),\n        # Case B:\n        (10.0, 0.15, 3, 40, 1.0, 0.0, 7),\n        # Case C:\n        (10.0, 0.18, 300, 500, 1.0, 0.0, 7),\n        # Case D:\n        (10.0, 0.20, 5, 40, 1.0, 0.0, 7),\n        # Case E:\n        (12.0, 0.25, 5, 50, 1.0, 0.0, 7),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n\n    # Diagnostic thresholds and constants\n    tau = 0.1\n    rho = 0.2\n    epsilon = 1e-12\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        a, eta_max, w, T, x0, sigma, P = case\n\n        # --- Simulation ---\n        # Initialize arrays for parameter and loss history\n        x_history = np.zeros(T + 1)\n        y_history = np.zeros(T + 1)\n\n        # Initial conditions\n        x_history[0] = x0\n        y_history[0] = 0.5 * a * x_history[0]**2\n\n        # Run the simulation loop for T epochs\n        for t in range(1, T + 1):\n            # Calculate learning rate with linear warmup\n            eta_t = eta_max * min(t / w, 1.0)\n            \n            # Update parameter using gradient descent\n            x_prev = x_history[t-1]\n            x_curr = x_prev * (1 - eta_t * a)\n            x_history[t] = x_curr\n            \n            # Calculate observed loss\n            true_loss = 0.5 * a * x_curr**2\n            noise = sigma * np.sin(2 * np.pi * t / P) if sigma > 0 else 0.0\n            y_history[t] = true_loss + noise\n\n        # --- Diagnostics ---\n        K = min(5, T)\n        y0 = y_history[0]\n        yK = y_history[K]\n        yT = y_history[T]\n\n        # 1.
