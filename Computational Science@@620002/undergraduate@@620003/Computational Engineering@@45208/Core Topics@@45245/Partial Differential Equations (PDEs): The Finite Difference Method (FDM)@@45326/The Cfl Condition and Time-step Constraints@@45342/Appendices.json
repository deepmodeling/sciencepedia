A solution will be derived by analyzing the properties of the numerical scheme.\n\n### Derivation\nTo analyze the scheme's properties, we perform a von Neumann stability analysis. We consider a single Fourier mode as a solution component:\n$$u^n_j = \\hat{u}^n(k) e^{i k j \\Delta x} = \\hat{u}^n e^{i j \\xi}$$\nwhere $\\hat{u}^n$ is the amplitude of the mode with wavenumber $k$ at time step $n$, and $\\xi = k \\Delta x$ is the dimensionless wavenumber. The evolution of the amplitude is given by the amplification factor $G$, such that $\\hat{u}^{n+1} = G \\hat{u}^n$.\n\nSubstituting the Fourier mode into the numerical scheme:\n$$\\hat{u}^{n+1} e^{i j \\xi} = \\hat{u}^n e^{i j \\xi} - \\sigma \\left( \\hat{u}^n e^{i j \\xi} - \\hat{u}^n e^{i (j-1) \\xi} \\right)$$\nDividing by $\\hat{u}^n e^{i j \\xi}$:\n$$G = 1 - \\sigma \\left( 1 - e^{-i \\xi} \\right)$$\nUsing Euler's formula $e^{-i\\xi} = \\cos(\\xi) - i\\sin(\\xi)$, we can write $G$ in Cartesian form:\n$$G = 1 - \\sigma(1 - \\cos(\\xi) + i\\sin(\\xi)) = (1 - \\sigma(1-\\cos(\\xi))) - i\\sigma\\sin(\\xi)$$\n\n**Analysis of Stability and Dissipation (Magnitude of G)**\nThe magnitude squared of the amplification factor is:\n$$|G|^2 = (1 - \\sigma(1-\\cos(\\xi)))^2 + (-\\sigma\\sin(\\xi))^2$$\n$$|G|^2 = 1 - 2\\sigma(1-\\cos\\xi) + \\sigma^2(1-\\cos\\xi)^2 + \\sigma^2\\sin^2\\xi$$\nUsing the identities $1-\\cos\\xi = 2\\sin^2(\\xi/2)$ and $\\sin\\xi = 2\\sin(\\xi/2)\\cos(\\xi/2)$:\n$$|G|^2 = 1 - 4\\sigma\\sin^2(\\xi/2) + \\sigma^2(2\\sin^2(\\xi/2))^2 + \\sigma^2(2\\sin(\\xi/2)\\cos(\\xi/2))^2$$\n$$|G|^2 = 1 - 4\\sigma\\sin^2(\\xi/2) + 4\\sigma^2\\sin^4(\\xi/2) + 4\\sigma^2\\sin^2(\\xi/2)\\cos^2(\\xi/2)$$\n$$|G|^2 = 1 - 4\\sigma\\sin^2(\\xi/2) + 4\\sigma^2\\sin^2(\\xi/2) (\\sin^2(\\xi/2) + \\cos^2(\\xi/2))$$\n$$|G|^2 = 1 - 4\\sigma(1-\\sigma)\\sin^2(\\xi/2)$$\nFor stability, we require $|G| \\le 1$, which means $|G|^2 \\le 1$. This implies $4\\sigma(1-\\sigma)\\sin^2(\\xi/2) \\ge 0$. Since $\\sin^2(\\xi/2) \\ge 0$, the stability condition is $\\sigma(1-\\sigma) \\ge 0$, which holds for $0 \\le \\sigma \\le 1$.\nNumerical dissipation occurs when $|G| < 1$. For $0 < \\sigma < 1$ and any nonzero mode ($\\xi \\neq 0$), we have $\\sigma(1-\\sigma) > 0$ and $\\sin^2(\\xi/2) > 0$, so $|G|^2 < 1$. Thus, the scheme is dissipative.\n\n**Analysis of Dispersion (Phase of G)**\nThe exact solution to the advection equation for a mode $e^{ikx}$ is $e^{ik(x-ct)}$. After one time step $\\Delta t$, the exact amplification factor is $G_{exact} = e^{-ikc\\Delta t} = e^{-i(k\\Delta x)(c\\Delta t/\\Delta x)} = e^{-i\\xi\\sigma}$. The exact phase shift per step is $\\phi_{exact} = -\\sigma\\xi$.\nThe numerical phase shift per step is $\\phi_{num} = \\arg(G)$. Any difference $\\phi_{num} - \\phi_{exact} \\neq 0$ constitutes numerical dispersion.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For any $0<\\sigma<1$, every nonzero Fourier mode experiences per-step amplitude attenuation (strictly less than $1$ in magnitude), with the per-step attenuation maximized at $\\sigma=1/2$. At $\\sigma=1$, the update is an exact shift by one grid cell per time step, so all Fourier modes are nondissipative and nondispersive.**\n- From our analysis, for $0 < \\sigma < 1$ and $\\xi \\ne 0$, $|G|^2 = 1 - 4\\sigma(1-\\sigma)\\sin^2(\\xi/2) < 1$. This means $|G| < 1$, which corresponds to amplitude attenuation.\n- The per-step attenuation is maximized when $|G|$ is minimized. This occurs when the subtractive term $4\\sigma(1-\\sigma)\\sin^2(\\xi/2)$ is maximized. For a given mode $\\xi$, this requires maximizing the quadratic function $\\sigma(1-\\sigma)$, which occurs at $\\sigma=1/2$.\n- At $\\sigma=1$, the scheme becomes $u^{n+1}_j = u^n_j - 1(u^n_j - u^n_{j-1}) = u^n_{j-1}$. This is an exact shift of the solution by one grid cell to the right per time step. For $\\sigma=1$, $c\\Delta t/\\Delta x = 1 \\implies c\\Delta t=\\Delta x$. The exact solution $u(x, t+\\Delta t) = f(x-c\\Delta t) = f(x-\\Delta x)$ is exactly recovered by the scheme.\n- At $\\sigma=1$, the amplification factor is $G=1-1(1-e^{-i\\xi})=e^{-i\\xi}$. Its magnitude is $|G|=1$ (nondissipative), and its phase is $\\phi_{num}=-\\xi$. The exact phase is $\\phi_{exact}=-\\sigma\\xi = -1\\cdot\\xi = -\\xi$. Since $\\phi_{num}=\\phi_{exact}$, the scheme is also nondispersive.\nThis statement is entirely correct.\n\n**B. For any $0<\\sigma<1$, the scheme is non-dissipative but dispersive; moreover, increasing $\\sigma$ always increases the phase error for all wavenumbers.**\n- The first part, \"the scheme is non-dissipative\", is false, as shown above. The scheme is dissipative for $0 < \\sigma < 1$.\n- The second part, \"increasing $\\sigma$ always increases the phase error\", is also false. The phase error is zero at $\\sigma=1$. Thus, as $\\sigma$ is increased towards $1$ (e.g., from $0.9$ to $0.95$), the phase error must decrease.\nThis statement is incorrect.\n\n**C. Over a fixed physical time interval $T$ with $c$ and $\\Delta x$ held fixed, choosing $\\sigma$ closer to $1$ reduces the cumulative dissipation compared to choosing very small $\\sigma$.**\n- The total number of time steps is $N = T/\\Delta t$. Since $\\Delta t = \\sigma\\Delta x/c$, we have $N = Tc/(\\sigma\\Delta x)$.\n- The cumulative amplitude of a mode is $|G|^N$. We compare its value for $\\sigma \\to 1^-$ and $\\sigma \\to 0^+$.\n- As $\\sigma \\to 1^-$, let $\\sigma=1-\\epsilon$ with $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$. $|G|^2 = 1-4(1-\\epsilon)\\epsilon\\sin^2(\\xi/2) \\approx 1-4\\epsilon\\sin^2(\\xi/2)$. The number of steps is $N \\approx Tc/\\Delta x$. The final amplitude is $|G|^N \\approx (1-2\\epsilon\\sin^2(\\xi/2))^N \\approx \\exp(-N \\cdot 2\\epsilon\\sin^2(\\xi/2))$. Substituting $N$, this is $\\exp(-\\frac{2Tc}{\\Delta x}\\sin^2(\\xi/2) \\cdot \\epsilon)$, which approaches $e^0=1$ as $\\epsilon \\to 0$.\n- As $\\sigma \\to 0^+$, the number of steps $N \\to \\infty$. The limit of $|G( \\sigma )|^N$ can be evaluated as $\\lim_{\\sigma\\to 0} (1-4\\sigma(1-\\sigma)\\sin^2(\\xi/2))^{Tc/(2\\sigma\\Delta x)}$. This limit evaluates to $\\exp(-\\frac{2Tc}{\\Delta x}\\sin^2(\\xi/2))$, which is a value strictly less than $1$ for any non-zero mode.\n- Since the final amplitude is closer to $1$ for $\\sigma \\to 1$ than for $\\sigma \\to 0$, the cumulative dissipation is reduced.\nThis statement is correct.\n\n**D. The scheme is stable for any $\\sigma>0$ because upwinding eliminates dispersion.**\n- The stability analysis showed the scheme is stable only for $0 \\le \\sigma \\le 1$. For $\\sigma > 1$, $|G| > 1$, and the scheme is unconditionally unstable. The first part of the statement is false.\n- The reason given, \"because upwinding eliminates dispersion\", is also false. The scheme is dispersive for $0 < \\sigma < 1$. Stability is related to dissipation, not dispersion.\nThis statement is incorrect.\n\n**E. In the long-wave limit $|\\xi|\\ll 1$, the leading-order phase error per unit time (the coefficient of $k^3$ in the phase error expansion) vanishes at $\\sigma=1/2$ and at $\\sigma=1$.**\n- The phase error per unit time is related to the difference between the exact and numerical dispersion relations, $\\omega_{exact}=ck$ and $\\omega_{num}(k)$. Specifically, it corresponds to the odd-powered terms in the expansion of $\\text{Re}(\\omega_{num}) - \\omega_{exact}$.\n- A detailed expansion of $\\omega_{num} = (i/\\Delta t) \\ln(G)$ shows that\n$$\\omega_{num}(k) = ck - i\\frac{c\\Delta x(1-\\sigma)}{2}k^2 - \\frac{c(\\Delta x)^2(1-\\sigma)(1-2\\sigma)}{6}k^3 + O(k^4)$$\nThe real part is $\\text{Re}(\\omega_{num}) = ck - \\frac{c(\\Delta x)^2(1-\\sigma)(1-2\\sigma)}{6}k^3 + \\dots$.\nThe phase error per unit time is $\\omega_{exact} - \\text{Re}(\\omega_{num}) = \\frac{c(\\Delta x)^2(1-\\sigma)(1-2\\sigma)}{6}k^3 + \\dots$.\n- The leading-order term is proportional to $k^3$. Its coefficient, $\\frac{c(\\Delta x)^2(1-\\sigma)(1-2\\sigma)}{6}$, vanishes if $(1-\\sigma)(1-2\\sigma)=0$. This occurs at $\\sigma=1$ and $\\sigma=1/2$.\nThis statement is correct.\n\nSince options A, C, and E are all demonstrably correct, and the format instructions allow for multiple correct answers, all three will be selected.\n\n**Verdict**\n- Option A: **Correct**.\n- Option B: **Incorrect**.\n- Option C: **Correct**.\n- Option D: **Incorrect**.\n- Option E: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "2443031"}, {"introduction": "Theory is best understood when seen in action, and this hands-on coding exercise provides a direct, computational demonstration of the principles analyzed in the previous problem.

Over $n$ time steps, the mode is multiplied by $G(\\theta)^n$, corresponding in the continuum to an effective diffusive decay approximately like $\\exp(-\\nu_{\\text{num}} k^2 t)$ with $k = \\theta/\\Delta x$ and $t = n\\Delta t$.\n\nFor computational efficiency and exactness with respect to the discrete scheme on a periodic grid, we avoid iterating $n$ steps explicitly. Instead, we compute the discrete Fourier transform (via the Discrete Fourier Transform) of the initial data, multiply each Fourier coefficient by $G(\\theta)^n$, and then apply the inverse transform to obtain the numerical solution after $n$ steps:\n$$\n\\widehat{u}^{\\,n}_m = \\left(G(\\theta_m)\\right)^n \\widehat{u}^{\\,0}_m, \\quad \\theta_m = \\frac{2\\pi m}{N},\n$$\nwhere $m$ indexes the discrete Fourier modes in the standard ordering of the Fast Fourier Transform. This procedure provides the exact result of the linear scheme after $n$ steps on the periodic grid, without roundoff accumulation from many time loop iterations.\n\nFor each test case, we proceed as follows:\n1. Set $L = 1$, $a = 1$, $N = 128$, $\\Delta x = L/N$, and the target Courant number $C$.\n2. Set $\\Delta t = C\\,\\Delta x / a$. Compute $n_{\\text{steps}} = \\operatorname{round}(T/\\Delta t)$ and $t' = n_{\\text{steps}}\\Delta t$.\n3. Define the initial condition $u_0(x)$ as specified. For the smooth case, $u_0(x) = \\sin(2\\pi x)$. For the discontinuous (box) case,\n$$\nu_0(x) = \\begin{cases}\n1, & 0.25 \\le x < 0.75,\\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n4. Compute the exact solution at $t'$: $u_{\\text{exact}}(x_i, t') = u_0\\!\\left((x_i - a t') \\bmod L\\right)$.\n5. Compute the numerical solution after $n_{\\text{steps}}$ by applying the spectral form of the scheme with amplification factor $G(\\theta_m)$ as above.\n6. Compute the normalized discrete $\\ell^2$ error\n$$\nE = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\left(u_i^{n_{\\text{steps}}} - u_{\\text{exact}}(x_i,t')\\right)^2\\right)^{1/2}}{\\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\left(u_{\\text{exact}}(x_i,t')\\right)^2\\right)^{1/2}}.\n$$\n\nBecause $\\nu_{\\text{num}}$ grows as $C$ decreases with fixed $\\Delta x$, we expect the errors to be smallest for $C$ close to $1$ and to increase as $C$ is reduced to $0.5$, then to $0.1$, and especially to $10^{-4}$. This holds for both smooth and discontinuous initial data, with the discontinuous case exhibiting stronger visible smearing due to the higher content of high-frequency modes, which are damped more severely by $|G(\\theta)|^n$ when $C$ is very small.
