The data is self-contained, consistent, and requires no external information. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe core of this problem rests on the uniqueness theorem of polynomial interpolation. This theorem states that for a set of $n+1$ distinct points $\\{(x_{i}, y_{i})\\}_{i=0}^{n}$, there exists a single, unique polynomial of degree at most $n$ that passes through every point in the set.\n\nIn this problem, we are given $n+1 = 4$ distinct input locations $x_{0} = -1$, $x_{1} = 0$, $x_{2} = 2$, and $x_{3} = 3$. The corresponding output values $y_{i}$ are generated from a known polynomial model $P(x) = x^{3} - 2x^{2} + 5$.\nThe data points are therefore:\n- $(x_{0}, y_{0}) = (-1, P(-1)) = (-1, (-1)^{3} - 2(-1)^{2} + 5) = (-1, -1 - 2 + 5) = (-1, 2)$\n- $(x_{1}, y_{1}) = (0, P(0)) = (0, (0)^{3} - 2(0)^{2} + 5) = (0, 5)$\n- $(x_{2}, y_{2}) = (2, P(2)) = (2, (2)^{3} - 2(2)^{2} + 5) = (2, 8 - 8 + 5) = (2, 5)$\n- $(x_{3}, y_{3}) = (3, P(3)) = (3, (3)^{3} - 2(3)^{2} + 5) = (3, 27 - 18 + 5) = (3, 14)$\n\nThe problem states that $L(x)$ is the unique degree-$3$ polynomial that interpolates these four points. The degree of the given polynomial $P(x)$ is $3$. By its very construction, $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $3$ that passes through all four data points.\n\nAccording to the uniqueness theorem, there can only be one such polynomial of degree at most $3$. Therefore, the Lagrange interpolating polynomial $L(x)$ must be identical to the original polynomial $P(x)$ for all values of $x$.\n$$L(x) \\equiv P(x) = x^{3} - 2x^{2} + 5$$\nThis insight makes constructing the Lagrange basis polynomials, a computationally intensive task, entirely unnecessary.

The polynomial is to be expressed in a single closed-form analytic expression.\n\nThe condition for polynomial interpolation is that the polynomial must match the function value at each interpolation node. That is, for each $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N\\}$, the following must hold:\n$$P_N(x_k) = f(x_k)$$\n\nFirst, we must evaluate the function $f(x)$ at the specified nodes $x_k = k$. The value of the function at the $k$-th node is denoted by $y_k$:\n$$y_k = f(x_k) = f(k) = \\sin(2\\pi k)$$\nFor any integer value of $k$, the argument of the sine function, $2\\pi k$, is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$. The sine function is zero for all integer multiples of $\\pi$, and thus specifically for all integer multiples of $2\\pi$.\n$$y_k = \\sin(2\\pi k) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N\\}$$\n\nConsequently, the interpolation conditions for the polynomial $P_N(x)$ are:\n$$P_N(0) = 0$$\n$$P_N(1) = 0$$\n$$\\vdots$$\n$$P_N(N) = 0$$\nThis set of conditions implies that the polynomial $P_N(x)$ has $N+1$ distinct roots at $x = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, N$.\n\nThe problem states that $P_N(x)$ must be a polynomial of degree at most $N$. According to the fundamental theorem of algebra, a non-zero polynomial of degree $d$ has at most $d$ roots in the complex plane. If the polynomial $P_N(x)$ were non-zero, its degree, which is at most $N$, would be less than the number of its roots, which is $N+1$. This is a contradiction.\n\nThe only polynomial that can have more roots than its degree is the zero polynomial, $P_N(x) \\equiv 0$. The degree of the zero polynomial is conventionally defined as $-\\infty$ or $-1$, which satisfies the condition of being at most $N$ for any $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Therefore, the unique polynomial of degree at most $N$ that satisfies the $N+1$ interpolation conditions is the zero polynomial.\n\nThis conclusion can be formally verified using the Lagrange form of the interpolating polynomial, which is given by:\n$$P_N(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{N} y_j L_j(x)$$\nwhere $y_j = f(x_j)$ and $L_j(x)$ are the Lagrange basis polynomials defined as:\n$$L_j(x) = \\prod_{\\substack{k=0 \\\\ k \\ne j}}^{N} \\frac{x-x_k}{x_j-x_k}$$\nAs established, $y_j = 0$ for all $j=0, 1, \\dots, N$. Substituting these values into the Lagrange formula, we obtain:\n$$P_N(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{N} (0) \\cdot L_j(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{N} 0 = 0$$\nThis rigorously confirms that the interpolating polynomial is identically zero. The phenomenon demonstrated here is a classic example of aliasing, where the sampling rate is insufficient to capture the behavior of the oscillating function between the nodes.\n\nThe required single closed-form analytic expression for $P_N(x)$ is simply $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2425926"}, {"introduction": "Let's extend our understanding from one-dimensional curves to two-dimensional surfaces, a common task in computational engineering.

The use of a linear polynomial to approximate a temperature field over a small triangular element is a fundamental and standard technique in computational heat transfer and finite element analysis. It is a well-posed problem: three non-collinear points $(x_i, y_i)$ with corresponding values $T_i$ uniquely define a plane $T(x,y) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2y$. The vertices $V_{1}=(0,0)$, $V_{2}=(2,1)$, and $V_{3}=(1,3)$ are not collinear, as the vector $\\vec{V_1V_2}=(2,1)$ is not parallel to $\\vec{V_1V_3}=(1,3)$. The problem is objective, providing all necessary data in a clear and unambiguous manner. It contains no scientific flaws, contradictions, or missing information.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem states that the temperature field $T(x,y)$ within the triangular patch is given by a first-degree polynomial that interpolates the temperatures at the three vertices. This is the two-dimensional Lagrange interpolant for a linear triangular element.\n\nThe interpolated temperature at any point $(x,y)$ inside the triangle can be expressed using barycentric coordinates, which serve as the Lagrange basis functions for a triangular element. The temperature $T(P)$ at a point $P=(x,y)$ is given by a weighted average of the vertex temperatures:\n$$T(P) = N_{1}(P)T_{1} + N_{2}(P)T_{2} + N_{3}(P)T_{3}$$\nwhere $T_{1}$, $T_{2}$, and $T_{3}$ are the temperatures at vertices $V_{1}$, $V_{2}$, and $V_{3}$ respectively. The functions $N_{i}(P)$ are the basis functions (or shape functions), which are the barycentric coordinates of the point $P$. These functions are linear in $x$ and $y$ and satisfy the property $N_{i}(V_{j}) = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nThe barycentric coordinates $(N_1, N_2, N_3)$ for a point $P$ are defined by the vector equation:\n$$P = N_{1}V_{1} + N_{2}V_{2} + N_{3}V_{3}$$\nsubject to the constraint:\n$$N_{1} + N_{2} + N_{3} = 1$$\nWe are asked to find the temperature at the centroid of the triangle, $C$. The coordinates of the centroid are given by the arithmetic mean of the vertex coordinates:\n$$C = \\left(\\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}}{3}, \\frac{y_{1}+y_{2}+y_{3}}{3}\\right)$$\nThis can be written in vector form as:\n$$C = \\frac{1}{3}V_{1} + \\frac{1}{3}V_{2} + \\frac{1}{3}V_{3}$$\nBy comparing this expression for the centroid $C$ with the definition of barycentric coordinates, we can directly identify the basis function values at the centroid:\n$$N_{1}(C) = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n$$N_{2}(C) = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n$$N_{3}(C) = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nThis is a general property for any triangle: the barycentric coordinates of the centroid are always $(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3})$.\n\nTherefore, the temperature at the centroid, $T_{c}$, is found by substituting these basis function values into the interpolation formula:\n$$T_{c} = T(C) = N_{1}(C)T_{1} + N_{2}(C)T_{2} + N_{3}(C)T_{3}$$\n$$T_{c} = \\frac{1}{3}T_{1} + \\frac{1}{3}T_{2} + \\frac{1}{3}T_{3} = \\frac{T_{1} + T_{2} + T_{3}}{3}$$\nThis elegant result shows that for a linear interpolation over a triangle, the value at the centroid is simply the arithmetic average of the values at the vertices.
