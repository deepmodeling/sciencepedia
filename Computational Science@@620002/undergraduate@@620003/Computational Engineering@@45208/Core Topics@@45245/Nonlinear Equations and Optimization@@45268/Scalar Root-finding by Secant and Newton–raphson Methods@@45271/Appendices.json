This is a fundamental task in computational astrodynamics. Before proceeding to a solution, we must rigorously validate the problem statement.\n\nThe givens are:\n- The equation: $M = E - e \\sin(E)$\n- Parameter ranges: eccentricity $e \\in [0, 1)$, mean anomaly $M \\in [0, 2\\pi)$\n- Solution domain: eccentric anomaly $E \\in [0, 2\\pi]$\n- Test cases: A set of six $(e, M)$ pairs.\n- Numerical requirements: residual $|E - e \\sin(E) - M| \\leq 10^{-13}$, and the result must be rounded to $12$ decimal places.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, rooted in celestial mechanics. It is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution to be determined. The test cases include scenarios known to be challenging for numerical methods, such as high eccentricity ($e \\approx 1$) combined with mean anomalies near $0$ or $2\\pi$, but they remain physically and mathematically valid. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed.\n\nThe task is to find the root of the scalar function $f(E) = E - e \\sin(E) - M$ for given parameters $e$ and $M$.\n\nFirst, we establish the existence and uniqueness of a solution $E \\in [0, 2\\pi]$ for any $M \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ and $e \\in [0, 1)$. The first derivative of $f(E)$ with respect to $E$ is:\n$$ f'(E) = \\frac{d}{dE} (E - e \\sin(E) - M) = 1 - e \\cos(E) $$\nSince $e \\in [0, 1)$, we have $e < 1$. The cosine function is bounded, $|\\cos(E)| \\le 1$. Therefore, $e \\cos(E) < 1$ for any $E$. This implies that the derivative $f'(E)$ is strictly positive for all $E$:\n$$ f'(E) = 1 - e \\cos(E) > 1 - e > 0 $$\nA strictly positive derivative means that $f(E)$ is a strictly monotonically increasing function. Such a function can intersect the axis $f(E)=0$ at most once, which guarantees the uniqueness of the root.\n\nTo prove existence, we evaluate the function at the boundaries of the domain $[0, 2\\pi]$:\n$$ f(0) = 0 - e \\sin(0) - M = -M $$\n$$ f(2\\pi) = 2\\pi - e \\sin(2\\pi) - M = 2\\pi - M $$\nGiven $M \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, we have $f(0) = -M \\le 0$ and $f(2\\pi) = 2\\pi - M > 0$. Since $f(E)$ is continuous and changes sign over the interval $[0, 2\\pi]$, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees the existence of at least one root $E$ in this interval. Combined with uniqueness, this confirms a single, unique root exists in $[0, 2\\pi]$.\n\nTo find this root numerically, we employ the Newton-Raphson method. This is an efficient iterative algorithm with quadratic convergence under favorable conditions. The iterative formula to find successive approximations $E_{k+1}$ from $E_k$ is:\n$$ E_{k+1} = E_k - \\frac{f(E_k)}{f'(E_k)} = E_k - \\frac{E_k - e \\sin(E_k) - M}{1 - e \\cos(E_k)} $$\nAn initial guess, $E_0$, is required. A simple and often effective choice for Kepler's equation is $E_0 = M$. While more sophisticated initial guesses exist, particularly for the challenging regime where $e \\to 1$ and $M \\to 0$ or $M \\to 2\\pi$, the choice $E_0=M$ is sufficiently robust to achieve convergence for all test cases provided. The iteration proceeds until the absolute value of the residual, $|f(E_k)|$, is less than or equal to the specified tolerance of $10^{-13}$.\n\nThe algorithm for each $(e, M)$ pair is as follows:\n1. Set the initial guess for the eccentric anomaly: $E \\leftarrow M$.\n2. Begin an iterative loop:\n   a. Calculate the residual: $r = E - e \\sin(E) - M$.\n   b. Check for convergence: if $|r| \\le 10^{-13}$, terminate the loop.\n   c. Calculate the derivative: $g = 1 - e \\cos(E)$.\n   d. Update the estimate for the eccentric anomaly: $E \\leftarrow E - r/g$.\n3. Once the loop terminates, the resulting value of $E$ is the solution. This solution is then rounded to $12$ decimal places as required.

Thus, the computed value will be approximately $\\widehat{f}(x_0) \\approx -10^{-8}$.\n\nNext, we analyze the numerical approximation of the derivative at $x_0$:\n$$\n\\widehat{f}'(x_0) = \\frac{\\widehat{f}(x_0+h) - \\widehat{f}(x_0-h)}{2h}\n$$\nwith $x_0 = 1 + 10^{-3}$ and $h = 10^{-16}$.\n\nThe core of the analysis lies in the computation of the numerator, $\\widehat{f}(x_0+h) - \\widehat{f}(x_0-h)$. This involves the subtraction of two nearly equal numbers, a classic scenario for catastrophic cancellation.\n\nLet us determine the magnitude of the terms being subtracted. For $y$ in the neighborhood of $x_0$, the function value is:\n$$\nf(y) = (y-1)^8 - 10^{-8} \\approx (x_0-1)^8 - 10^{-8} = (10^{-3})^8 - 10^{-8} \\approx -10^{-8}\n$$\nSo, both $f(x_0+h)$ and $f(x_0-h)$ are very close to $-10^{-8}$.\n\nAccording to the problem's error model, the computed value $\\widehat{f}(y)$ has an absolute error $|\\widehat{f}(y) - f(y)| \\le u|f(y)|$. For $y=x_0 \\pm h$, this absolute error is approximately:\n$$\n\\text{Error}(\\widehat{f}(y)) \\approx u |f(y)| \\approx (1.11 \\times 10^{-16}) \\times |-10^{-8}| \\approx 1.11 \\times 10^{-24}\n$$\nThe true value of the numerator is given by the Taylor expansion:\n$$\nf(x_0+h) - f(x_0-h) = 2h f'(x_0) + O(h^3)\n$$\nThe exact derivative is $f'(x) = 8(x-1)^7$. At $x_0$, this is $f'(x_0) = 8(10^{-3})^7 = 8 \\times 10^{-21}$.\nSo, the true numerator is approximately $2h f'(x_0) = 2(10^{-16})(8 \\times 10^{-21}) = 1.6 \\times 10^{-36}$.\n\nWhen the numerator $\\widehat{f}(x_0+h) - \\widehat{f}(x_0-h)$ is computed, the true value ($1.6 \\times 10^{-36}$) is completely swamped by the rounding errors of the two terms. The subtraction of two numbers, each with an absolute rounding error of about $10^{-24}$, results in a computed difference whose value is effectively noise. The magnitude of this noise is on the order of the original rounding errors.\n$$\n|\\text{Numerator}| \\approx |\\widehat{f}(x_0+h) - \\widehat{f}(x_0-h)| \\approx u|f(x_0)| \\sim 10^{-24}\n$$\nThe sign of this result is essentially random.\n\nNow, we can estimate the computed derivative:\n$$\n\\widehat{f}'(x_0) = \\frac{\\text{Numerator}}{2h} \\approx \\frac{\\pm O(10^{-24})}{2 \\times 10^{-16}} \\approx \\pm O(0.5 \\times 10^{-8}) = \\pm O(5 \\times 10^{-9})\n$$\nThe magnitude of the computed derivative is approximately $5 \\times 10^{-9}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the Newton update $\\Delta x_0$:\n$$\n\\Delta x_0 = -\\frac{\\widehat{f}(x_0)}{\\widehat{f}'(x_0)} \\approx -\\frac{-10^{-8}}{\\pm 5 \\times 10^{-9}} = \\pm \\frac{10^{-8}}{5 \\times 10^{-9}} = \\pm 2\n$$\nThe Newton update will have a magnitude of approximately $2$. This will send the next iterate $x_1 = x_0 + \\Delta x_0 \\approx 1.001 \\pm 2$, which is far from the true roots (which are near $x=1.1$ and $x=0.9$).\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. The numerator $f(x_0+h)-f(x_0-h)$ is dominated by rounding error, so $\\widehat{f}'(x_0)$ has magnitude about $5\\times 10^{-9}$ and $\\Delta x_0\\approx +2$, sending $x_1$ far from the root.\nThis option correctly identifies that the numerator is dominated by rounding error (catastrophic cancellation). The calculated magnitude of the derivative, $\\approx 5 \\times 10^{-9}$, and the subsequent Newton update, $\\Delta x_0 \\approx +2$, match our derivation precisely. The conclusion that this sends the iterate far from the root is also correct. The sign of the update depends on the random sign of the rounding error, but the magnitude is the key indicator of the numerical failure.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. The finite difference gives exactly $\\widehat{f}'(x_0)=0$, so the Newton update is undefined due to division by zero.\nThis outcome would occur if the floating-point representations of the arguments were identical, i.e., $fl(x_0+h) = fl(x_0-h)$. Since $h = 10^{-16}$ and the spacing between floating point numbers near $1$ is $\\text{ulp}(1) = 2^{-52} \\approx 2.22 \\times 10^{-16}$, the distance between the arguments $2h=2 \\times 10^{-16}$ is comparable to one ulp. It is not guaranteed that they will round to the same number. The more general phenomenon is catastrophic cancellation producing a garbage, non-zero result. Therefore, this specific outcome is less representative of the general problem than the one described in A.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. The finite difference is accurate to relative error $\\mathcal{O}(u)$, so $\\widehat{f}'(x_0)\\approx f'(x_0)=8\\times 10^{-21}$ and $\\Delta x_0\\approx +1.25\\times 10^{12}$.\nThis option claims the derivative calculation is accurate. This is fundamentally false. The chosen stepsize $h = 10^{-16}$ is far too small, leading to catastrophic cancellation, not an accurate result. The roundoff error, which is proportional to $u/h$, dominates the truncation error, which is proportional to $h^2$. The provided calculation corresponds to an ideal scenario with no roundoff error, which contradicts the problem setup.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Choosing a smaller stepsize, for example $h=10^{-20}$, would reduce subtraction cancellation in $f(x_0+h)-f(x_0-h)$ and restore a reliable derivative estimate and convergence.\nThis statement is incorrect. The error due to subtraction cancellation in a finite difference formula is of the order $O(u/h)$. Decreasing $h$ from $10^{-16}$ to $10^{-20}$ would *increase* the roundoff error, making the derivative estimate even less reliable. To obtain a better estimate, one must choose a larger stepsize, balancing roundoff error against truncation error (which is $O(h^2)$).\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2434157"}]}
