It poses a standard, albeit instructive, question in the numerical analysis of ordinary differential equations. We shall proceed with the analysis and solution.\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of the two-step linear multistep method (LMM) given by the recurrence relation:\n$$ y_{n+2} - 2 y_{n+1} + y_n = 0 $$\nThis method is to be applied to the initial value problem (IVP) $y'(t) = -y(t)$ with $y(0) = 1$.\n\nA general $k$-step LMM is expressed as:\n$$ \\sum_{j=0}^{k} \\alpha_j y_{n+j} = h \\sum_{j=0}^{k} \\beta_j f(t_{n+j}, y_{n+j}) $$\nFor the given method, the number of steps is $k=2$. By comparing the two forms, we identify the coefficients:\n- $\\alpha_2 = 1$, $\\alpha_1 = -2$, $\\alpha_0 = 1$.\n- $\\beta_2 = 0$, $\\beta_1 = 0$, $\\beta_0 = 0$.\n\nA crucial observation is that all $\\beta_j$ coefficients are zero. This implies that the numerical method does not utilize the information from the differential equation $y' = f(t,y)$, in this case $f(t,y) = -y$. The method's evolution depends only upon its own coefficients and initial values, not upon the dynamics it is supposed to model. This is a severe deficiency, which will be illuminated by the formal analysis.\n\n### Part 1: Consistency and Zero-Stability\n\n**Consistency Analysis**\nAn LMM is defined as consistent if its order of accuracy $p$ is at least $1$ ($p \\ge 1$). This is equivalent to satisfying the following two algebraic conditions on its coefficients:\n$1$. $\\sum_{j=0}^{k} \\alpha_j = 0$\n$2$. $\\sum_{j=0}^{k} j \\alpha_j = \\sum_{j=0}^{k} \\beta_j$\n\nLet us verify these for the given method:\n$1$. $\\sum_{j=0}^{2} \\alpha_j = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 = 1 + (-2) + 1 = 0$. This condition is satisfied.\n$2$. For the left-hand side: $\\sum_{j=0}^{2} j \\alpha_j = (0 \\cdot \\alpha_0) + (1 \\cdot \\alpha_1) + (2 \\cdot \\alpha_2) = (0 \\cdot 1) + (1 \\cdot (-2)) + (2 \\cdot 1) = -2 + 2 = 0$.\nFor the right-hand side: $\\sum_{j=0}^{2} \\beta_j = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 + \\beta_2 = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0$.\nThe left-hand side equals the right-hand side. This condition is also satisfied.\n\nSince both conditions hold, the method is **consistent**. To determine its order, we examine the local truncation error, which is defined by the operator $L[y(t); h] = \\sum_{j=0}^k \\alpha_j y(t+jh) - h \\sum_{j=0}^k \\beta_j y'(t+jh)$. For this method:\n$$ L[y(t); h] = y(t+2h) - 2y(t+h) + y(t) $$\nUsing Taylor series expansions for $y(t+h)$ and $y(t+2h)$ around $t$:\n$y(t+h) = y(t) + h y'(t) + \\frac{h^2}{2} y''(t) + O(h^3)$\n$y(t+2h) = y(t) + 2h y'(t) + \\frac{(2h)^2}{2} y''(t) + O(h^3) = y(t) + 2h y'(t) + 2h^2 y''(t) + O(h^3)$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $L[y(t); h]$:\n$$ L[y(t); h] = [y(t) + 2h y'(t) + 2h^2 y''(t)] - 2[y(t) + h y'(t) + \\frac{h^2}{2} y''(t)] + y(t) + O(h^3) $$\n$$ L[y(t); h] = (1-2+1)y(t) + (2-2)h y'(t) + (2-1)h^2 y''(t) + O(h^3) = h^2 y''(t) + O(h^3) $$\nThe order of the method $p$ is defined by $L[y(t); h] = O(h^{p+1})$. Here, $p+1=2$, so the order is $p=1$. The consistency is confirmed.\n\n**Zero-Stability Analysis**\nThe zero-stability of an LMM is determined by the roots of its first characteristic polynomial, $\\rho(z)$:\n$$ \\rho(z) = \\sum_{j=0}^{k} \\alpha_j z^j $$\nFor the given method, this polynomial is:\n$$ \\rho(z) = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 z + \\alpha_2 z^2 = 1 - 2z + z^2 = (z-1)^2 $$\nThe roots of $\\rho(z)=0$ are found by solving $(z-1)^2 = 0$, which yields a double root at $z_1 = z_2 = 1$.\n\nThe **root condition** for zero-stability requires that:\n$1$. All roots of $\\rho(z)$ must lie within or on the unit circle in the complex plane (i.e., $|z| \\le 1$).\n$2$. Any root lying on the unit circle (i.e., $|z|=1$) must be simple (multiplicity $1$).\n\nIn our case, the root $z=1$ has magnitude $|1|=1$, so it lies on the unit circle. However, its multiplicity is $2$, which is greater than $1$. Therefore, the second part of the root condition is violated. The method is **not zero-stable**.\n\nAccording to Dahlquist's equivalence theorem, an LMM is convergent if and only if it is both consistent and zero-stable. Since this method is not zero-stable, it is **not convergent**. This means that as the step size $h$ approaches zero, the numerical solution will not converge to the true solution of the IVP. The numerical tests will demonstrate this divergence.\n\n### Part 2: Implementation and Computation\n\nThe numerical scheme is the linear homogeneous recurrence relation with constant coefficients:\n$$ y_{n+2} = 2y_{n+1} - y_n $$\nThe characteristic equation for this recurrence is $r^2 - 2r + 1 = 0$, which is identical to the polynomial $\\rho(r)$. It has a double root $r=1$. The general solution to such a recurrence is of the form:\n$$ y_n = c_1 (1)^n + c_2 n (1)^n = c_1 + c_2 n $$\nThe constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ are determined by the initial two values of the sequence, $y_0$ and $y_1$.\n- For $n=0$: $y_0 = c_1 + c_2 \\cdot 0 \\implies c_1 = y_0$.\n- For $n=1$: $y_1 = c_1 + c_2 \\cdot 1 \\implies c_2 = y_1 - c_1 = y_1 - y_0$.\n\nThus, the explicit formula for the numerical solution at step $n$ is:\n$$ y_n = y_0 + n(y_1 - y_0) $$\nThis expression shows that the numerical solution grows linearly with the step index $n$. This is a direct consequence of the double root at $z=1$ and is the mechanism of the instability.\n\nTo compute the numerical approximation $y_N$ at the final time $T=Nh$, we use this formula directly with $n=N$. For each test case $(T, h, \\text{start})$:\n$1$. Calculate the number of steps $N = T/h$.\n$2$. Set the initial value $y_0 = 1$.\n$3$. Determine the second value $y_1$ based on the 'start' condition:\n    - If 'exact', $y_1 = e^{-h}$.\n    - If 'constant', $y_1 = 1$.\n$4$. Compute the numerical solution at $t=T$: $y_N = y_0 + N(y_1 - y_0)$.\n$5$. Compute the true solution at $t=T$: $y(T) = e^{-T}$.\n$6$. The absolute error is $|y_N - e^{-T}|$.\n\nThis analytical solution to the recurrence is computationally exact and more efficient than a loop-based implementation, avoiding any accumulation of floating-point errors.

This advanced practice challenges you to build a variable step-size Adams-Bashforth-Moulton solver from first principles. You will move beyond fixed-formula coefficients and learn to derive them on the fly for non-uniform grids by integrating Lagrange interpolating polynomials. By implementing an adaptive controller that adjusts the step size to meet a specified error tolerance, you will gain invaluable insight into the sophisticated machinery that powers modern computational engineering software [@problem_id:2410057].", "problem": "You are to implement a variable step-size explicit Adams-Bashforth method of order three for ordinary differential equations, with adaptive step-size control based on a local truncation error estimate obtained from an Adams-Moulton corrector of order three. The method must handle non-uniform time steps by constructing and integrating Lagrange polynomials over a non-uniform stencil of history points.\n\nGiven an initial value problem for an ordinary differential equation,\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t,y), \\quad y(t_0) = y_0,\n$$\na $k$-step Adams-Bashforth method advances from $t_n$ to $t_{n+1}$ by approximating\n$$\ny_{n+1} = y_n + \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} p_{k-1}(\\tau) \\, d\\tau,\n$$\nwhere $p_{k-1}(\\tau)$ is the Lagrange interpolating polynomial of degree $k-1$ that interpolates the right-hand side data $\\{(t_{n-i}, f(t_{n-i}, y_{n-i}))\\}_{i=0}^{k-1}$. For non-uniform step sizes, the interpolation nodes $\\{t_{n}, t_{n-1}, \\dots\\}$ are not equally spaced, and the coefficients of the method must be derived by integrating the Lagrange basis polynomials over the interval $\\tau \\in [t_n, t_{n+1}]$. For the three-step Adams-Bashforth method, you must form $p_2(\\tau)$ using nodes $\\{t_n,t_{n-1},t_{n-2}\\}$.\n\nTo estimate the local truncation error and adapt the step size, you must use a predictor-corrector pair where the predictor is the explicit Adams-Bashforth method of order three and the corrector is the implicit Adams-Moulton method of order three. The Adams-Moulton method of order three uses the nodes $\\{t_{n+1},t_n,t_{n-1}\\}$ in an analogous construction. The difference between the corrected and predicted values at $t_{n+1}$ provides a proxy for the local truncation error of order $\\mathcal{O}(h^{4})$, which can be used in a standard adaptive step-size controller.\n\nYou must:\n- Start from the fundamental definition that a linear multistep method arises from integrating an interpolant of $f$ over a time step, and that the Lagrange basis on non-uniform nodes provides the unique polynomial interpolant.\n- Derive and implement a recipe to compute the Adams-Bashforth and Adams-Moulton coefficients for non-uniform grids by integrating the Lagrange basis polynomials constructed at the appropriate nodes. Do not assume uniform spacing.\n- Use a self-starting single-step method of order at least three (for example, an embedded Runge-Kutta method) to generate the first two steps so that a three-step method can proceed.\n- Design an adaptive controller that accepts or rejects steps based on a dimensionless error norm comparing the estimated local error to user-specified absolute and relative tolerances, and that adapts the step using a formula of the form $h_{\\text{new}} = \\mathrm{safety} \\cdot h \\cdot \\mathrm{err}^{-1/(p+1)}$ with reasonable bounds, where $p$ is the order of the base method and the error estimate is of order $\\mathcal{O}(h^{p+1})$.

It requires the implementation of a variable-step, third-order Adams-Bashforth-Moulton (ABM) predictor-corrector method. The core of the problem lies in handling non-uniform time steps by deriving the method's coefficients from first principles using Lagrange interpolation. This is a standard and rigorous approach to constructing high-order adaptive solvers. The problem is valid and will be solved as follows.\n\nAn initial value problem is given by $\\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t,y)$ with $y(t_0) = y_0$. A linear multistep method approximates the solution at step $n+1$ via the exact relation\n$$\ny(t_{n+1}) = y(t_n) + \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} f(\\tau, y(\\tau)) \\, d\\tau.\n$$\nThe method approximates the integral by replacing the true function $f(\\tau, y(\\tau))$ with a polynomial $p(\\tau)$ that interpolates known values of $f$ at a set of previous time points $\\{t_{n-i}\\}$. The coefficients of the method depend on the choice of interpolation points and the structure of the polynomial. For non-uniform step sizes $h_i = t_{i+1} - t_i$, these coefficients must be recomputed at each step.\n\n**1. Predictor: Third-Order Adams-Bashforth (AB3) Method**\n\nThe explicit AB3 method is used as a predictor. It computes a preliminary value $y^P_{n+1}$ at $t_{n+1} = t_n + h_n$ by integrating a polynomial $p_2(\\tau)$ of degree $2$ that interpolates the three preceding data points $\\{(t_n, f_n), (t_{n-1}, f_{n-1}), (t_{n-2}, f_{n-2})\\}$, where $f_k = f(t_k, y_k)$. The predictor formula is:\n$$\ny^P_{n+1} = y_n + \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} p_2(\\tau) \\, d\\tau.\n$$\nUsing the Lagrange basis, $p_2(\\tau) = f_n L_n(\\tau) + f_{n-1} L_{n-1}(\\tau) + f_{n-2} L_{n-2}(\\tau)$. The step is then written as:\n$$\ny^P_{n+1} = y_n + c_0 f_n + c_1 f_{n-1} + c_2 f_{n-2},\n$$\nwhere the coefficients $c_i$ are the integrals of the corresponding Lagrange basis polynomials. Let the step sizes be $h_n = t_{n+1} - t_n$, $h_{n-1} = t_n - t_{n-1}$, and $h_{n-2} = t_{n-1} - t_{n-2}$. These are not necessarily equal. After performing the integration, we find the coefficients to be:\n$$\nc_0 = \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} \\frac{(\\tau - t_{n-1})(\\tau - t_{n-2})}{(t_n - t_{n-1})(t_n - t_{n-2})} \\, d\\tau = h_n \\left( 1 + \\frac{h_n(2h_{n-1}+h_{n-2})}{2h_{n-1}(h_{n-1}+h_{n-2})} + \\frac{h_n^2}{3h_{n-1}(h_{n-1}+h_{n-2})} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nc_1 = \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} \\frac{(\\tau - t_n)(\\tau - t_{n-2})}{(t_{n-1} - t_n)(t_{n-1} - t_{n-2})} \\, d\\tau = -h_n^2 \\left( \\frac{h_{n-1}+h_{n-2}}{2h_{n-1}h_{n-2}} + \\frac{h_n}{3h_{n-1}h_{n-2}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nc_2 = \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} \\frac{(\\tau - t_n)(\\tau - t_{n-1})}{(t_{n-2} - t_n)(t_{n-2} - t_{n-1})} \\, d\\tau = h_n^2 \\left( \\frac{h_{n-1}}{2h_{n-2}(h_{n-1}+h_{n-2})} + \\frac{h_n}{3h_{n-2}(h_{n-1}+h_{n-2})} \\right)\n$$\n\n**2. Corrector: Third-Order Adams-Moulton (AM3) Method**\n\nThe implicit AM3 method corrects the predicted value. It integrates a polynomial $\\tilde{p}_2(\\tau)$ that passes through the points $\\{(t_{n+1}, f^*_{n+1}), (t_n, f_n), (t_{n-1}, f_{n-1})\\}$, where $f^*_{n+1} = f(t_{n+1}, y^P_{n+1})$ is the function evaluation using the predicted solution. The corrector formula is:\n$$\ny^C_{n+1} = y_n + \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} \\tilde{p}_2(\\tau) \\, d\\tau = y_n + c^*_0 f^*_{n+1} + c^*_1 f_n + c^*_2 f_{n-1}.\n$$\nThe coefficients $c^*_i$ for this step depend on the step sizes $h_n$ and $h_{n-1}$. Again, by integrating the Lagrange basis polynomials, we derive:\n$$\nc^*_0 = \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} \\frac{(\\tau - t_n)(\\tau - t_{n-1})}{(t_{n+1} - t_n)(t_{n+1} - t_{n-1})} \\, d\\tau = h_n \\left( \\frac{2h_n + 3h_{n-1}}{6(h_n+h_{n-1})} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nc^*_1 = \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} \\frac{(\\tau - t_{n+1})(\\tau - t_{n-1})}{(t_n - t_{n+1})(t_n - t_{n-1})} \\, d\\tau = h_n \\left( \\frac{h_n + 3h_{n-1}}{6h_{n-1}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nc^*_2 = \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} \\frac{(\\tau - t_{n+1})(\\tau - t_n)}{(t_{n-1} - t_{n+1})(t_{n-1} - t_n)} \\, d\\tau = - \\frac{h_n^3}{6h_{n-1}(h_n+h_{n-1})}\n$$\n\n**3. Error Estimation and Adaptive Step-Size Control**\n\nThe local truncation error (LTE) of the order-$p$ AB predictor is proportional to the difference between the corrected and predicted values. For the third-order ($p=3$) ABM pair, the LTE is $\\mathcal{O}(h^4)$, and the error of the predictor can be estimated as $E_{n+1} \\approx y^C_{n+1} - y^P_{n+1}$. A dimensionless error measure $\\epsilon$ is defined to compare this estimate against user-specified absolute and relative tolerances, $\\text{atol}$ and $\\text{rtol}$:\n$$\n\\epsilon = \\frac{|y^C_{n+1} - y^P_{n+1}|}{\\text{atol} + \\text{rtol} \\cdot |y^C_{n+1}|}\n$$\nThe step is accepted if $\\epsilon \\le 1$. Otherwise, it is rejected, and the step is recomputed with a smaller step size. The new step size $h_{\\text{new}}$ is determined by the standard formula:\n$$\nh_{\\text{new}} = S \\cdot h_n \\cdot \\epsilon^{-1/(p+1)} = S \\cdot h_n \\cdot \\epsilon^{-1/4},\n$$\nwhere $S$ is a safety factor (typically $0.9$). To ensure stability of the integration, the growth and shrinkage of the step size are bounded by reasonable factors, e.g., $h_{\\text{new}} \\in [h_n \\cdot 0.2, h_n \\cdot 4.0]$. The new step size is also clamped between a minimum $h_{\\min}$ and maximum $h_{\\max}$.\n\n**4. Startup Procedure**\n\nA three-step method requires a history of three points, $\\{t_0, t_1, t_2\\}$, to compute the first step towards $t_3$. The initial condition provides only $(t_0, y_0)$. Therefore, a self-starting procedure is needed. We use the classical fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method to generate the first two points, $(t_1, y_1)$ and $(t_2, y_2)$, starting from $(t_0, y_0)$. We take two fixed steps of size $h_0$, the initial step size. This provides the necessary history $\\{ (t_0, f_0), (t_1, f_1), (t_2, f_2) \\}$ to initiate the main ABM integration loop from $t_2$.\n\nThe overall algorithm proceeds by first performing the startup, then entering a loop that advances time from $t_2$ to the final time $T$. Within the loop, it computes coefficients, performs the predict-correct cycle, estimates the error, and adapts the step size, either accepting the step and advancing or rejecting it and retrying. For the final step, the step size is adjusted to land exactly at $T$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import deque\nimport math\n\n#\n# Professor's strict note: The implementation that follows is a direct\n# realization of the variable-step Adams-Bashforth-Moulton method as derived.\n# It is built from first principles as required, including a robust adaptive\n# step-size controller and a suitable startup method.\n#\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run the test suite and print results.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Test Case 1: Happy-path exponential decay\n    test1 = {\n        \"f\": lambda t, y: -10.0 * y,\n        \"y0\": 1.0,\n        \"t0\": 0.0,\n        \"T\": 1.0,\n        \"exact_sol\": lambda t: np.exp(-10.0 * t),\n        \"params\": {\n            \"rtol\": 1e-6, \"atol\": 1e-12, \"h0\": 0.05,\n            \"h_min\": 1e-8, \"h_max\": 0.5\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Test Case 2: Time-dependent forcing with known solution\n    test2 = {\n        \"f\": lambda t, y: -y + 2.0 * np.exp(-t) * np.cos(2.0 * t),\n        \"y0\": 0.0,\n        \"t0\": 0.0,\n        \"T\": 3.0,\n        \"exact_sol\": lambda t: np.exp(-t) * np.sin(2.0 * t),\n        \"params\": {\n            \"rtol\": 1e-6, \"atol\": 1e-12, \"h0\": 0.05,\n            \"h_min\": 1e-8, \"h_max\": 0.5\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Test Case 3: Moderately stiff linear test\n    test3 = {\n        \"f\": lambda t, y: -20.0 * y + 20.0 * np.cos(t) -
