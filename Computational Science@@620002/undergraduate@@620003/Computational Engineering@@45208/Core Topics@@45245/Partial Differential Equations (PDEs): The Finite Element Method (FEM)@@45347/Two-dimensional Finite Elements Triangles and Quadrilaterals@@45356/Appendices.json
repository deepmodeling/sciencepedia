Given a quadrilateral $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_0,\\mathbf{v}_1,\\mathbf{v}_2,\\mathbf{v}_3\\right)$ in order, first determine whether it is self-intersecting (a bow-tie). If it is self-intersecting, compute the unique interior intersection point $\\mathbf{p}$ of the two crossing edges and triangulate by introducing the Steiner point $\\mathbf{p}$, producing the fan of four triangles $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_0,\\mathbf{v}_1,\\mathbf{p}\\right)$, $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_1,\\mathbf{v}_2,\\mathbf{p}\\right)$, $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_2,\\mathbf{v}_3,\\mathbf{p}\\right)$, $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_3,\\mathbf{v}_0,\\mathbf{p}\\right)$.\n2.

For a convex quadrilateral, evaluate both diagonals:\n   - Using diagonal $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_0,\\mathbf{v}_2\\right)$ gives triangles $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_0,\\mathbf{v}_1,\\mathbf{v}_2\\right)$ and $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_0,\\mathbf{v}_2,\\mathbf{v}_3\\right)$.\n   - Using diagonal $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_1,\\mathbf{v}_3\\right)$ gives triangles $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_1,\\mathbf{v}_2,\\mathbf{v}_3\\right)$ and $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_1,\\mathbf{v}_3,\\mathbf{v}_0\\right)$.\n   Choose the diagonal that maximizes the minimum interior angle across the resulting two triangles.\n3. For a concave simple quadrilateral (exactly one reflex interior angle greater than $180^{\\circ}$), only one diagonal lies entirely inside the polygon. Identify the reflex vertex by the sign of successive cross products and restrict to the unique valid interior diagonal: if the reflex index is $0$ or $2$, use $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_0,\\mathbf{v}_2\\right)$; if it is $1$ or $3$, use $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_1,\\mathbf{v}_3\\right)$. This ensures the split remains within the quadrilateral.\n4. After selecting a two-triangle split as in $2$ or $3$, compute the minimum interior angle across all produced triangles. If this minimum angle is smaller than the threshold $\\Theta_{\\min}$, then introduce the centroid $\\mathbf{c}=\\left(\\mathbf{v}_0+\\mathbf{v}_1+\\mathbf{v}_2+\\mathbf{v}_3\\right)/4$ and retriangulate into four triangles $\\left(\\mathbf{v}_i,\\mathbf{v}_{i+1 \\bmod 4},\\mathbf{c}\\right)$ for $i\\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}$. Use this centroid fan triangulation as the final triangulation for that quadrilateral.\n5. Compute the minimum interior angle across all final triangles, in degrees.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in computational engineering.

We will construct this algorithm from first principles. Vectors are denoted in bold, e.g., $\\mathbf{v}$, and their components are $(v_x, v_y)$.\n\n**I. Geometric Preliminaries**\n\nWe require several fundamental geometric functions.\n\n1.  **Vector Operations**: Let $\\mathbf{u} = (u_x, u_y)$ and $\\mathbf{v} = (v_x, v_y)$ be two vectors.\n    -   Dot product: $\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = u_x v_x + u_y v_y$.\n    -   Scalar $z$-component of the cross product: $[\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}]_z = u_x v_y - u_y v_x$.\n    -   Euclidean norm: $\\lVert \\mathbf{u} \\rVert = \\sqrt{u_x^2 + u_y^2}$.\n\n2.  **Triangle Interior Angles**: For a triangle with vertices $\\mathbf{a}$, $\\mathbf{b}$, $\\mathbf{c}$, the interior angle at vertex $\\mathbf{b}$ is computed using the provided formula based on the dot product of the vectors forming the angle:\n    $$ \\theta_{\\mathbf{b}} = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{(\\mathbf{a}-\\mathbf{b})\\cdot(\\mathbf{c}-\\mathbf{b})}{\\lVert \\mathbf{a}-\\mathbf{b}\\rVert\\,\\lVert \\mathbf{c}-\\mathbf{b}\\rVert}\\right) $$\n    This function will be applied to find all three angles of a triangle by cyclically permuting the vertices. The result must be converted from radians to degrees.\n\n3.  **Line Segment Intersection**: To detect self-intersection, we must determine if two non-adjacent edges cross. Consider two line segments, one from $\\mathbf{p}_1$ to $\\mathbf{p}_2$ and another from $\\mathbf{q}_1$ to $\\mathbf{q}_2$. Let $\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{p}_2 - \\mathbf{p}_1$ and $\\mathbf{s} = \\mathbf{q}_2 - \\mathbf{q}_1$. The intersection point exists if we can find parameters $t, u \\in [0, 1]$ such that $\\mathbf{p}_1 + t\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{q}_1 + u\\mathbf{s}$.\n    This is a linear system for $t$ and $u$. Using the scalar cross product, the solution is:\n    $$ t = \\frac{[(\\mathbf{q}_1 - \\mathbf{p}_1) \\times \\mathbf{s}]_z}{[\\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{s}]_z} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad u = \\frac{[(\\mathbf{q}_1 - \\mathbf{p}_1) \\times \\mathbf{r}]_z}{[\\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{s}]_z} $$\n    An intersection of the open segments occurs if the denominator $[\\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{s}]_z \\neq 0$ and both $t \\in (0, 1)$ and $u \\in (0, 1)$. If an intersection is found, the intersection point is $\\mathbf{p}_{int} = \\mathbf{p}_1 + t\\mathbf{r}$.\n\n**II. Quadrilateral Analysis and Triangulation Strategy**\n\nThe core of the algorithm is a multi-step process for a given quadrilateral $(\\mathbf{v}_0, \\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_2, \\mathbf{v}_3)$.\n\n**Step 1: Self-Intersection Detection**\nA quadrilateral is self-intersecting (bow-tie) if a pair of its non-adjacent edges crosses. The two pairs of non-adjacent edges are $(\\mathbf{v}_0, \\mathbf{v}_1)$ with $(\\mathbf{v}_2, \\mathbf{v}_3)$, and $(\\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_2)$ with $(\\mathbf{v}_3, \\mathbf{v}_0)$. We apply the line segment intersection test to the first pair. If it intersects, the quadrilateral is a bow-tie. If not, we test the second pair. If either test is positive, we proceed with the bow-tie triangulation.\n-   **Action**: If an intersection point $\\mathbf{p}$ is found, we form a fan triangulation of four triangles: $(\\mathbf{v}_0, \\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{p})$, $(\\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_2, \\mathbf{p})$, $(\\mathbf{v}_2, \\mathbf{v}_3, \\mathbf{p})$, and $(\\mathbf{v}_3, \\mathbf{v}_0, \\mathbf{p})$. We then compute the minimum angle over these four triangles. This is the final triangulation for this case.\n\n**Step 2: Simple Quadrilateral Classification (Convex vs. Concave)**\nIf the quadrilateral is not self-intersecting, it is simple. We must determine if it is convex or concave. This can be done by examining the \"turn\" at each vertex.\nFirst, we establish a consistent vertex ordering (e.g., counter-clockwise, CCW) by computing the signed area of the polygon using the shoelace formula:\n$$ A = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=0}^{3} (x_i y_{i+1 \\bmod 4} - x_{i+1 \\bmod 4} y_i) $$\nIf $A<0$, we can conceptually reverse the vertex order to enforce CCW winding.\nFor a CCW-ordered polygon, the turn at vertex $\\mathbf{v}_i$ is determined by the sign of the scalar cross product of the edge vectors meeting at $\\mathbf{v}_i$: $S_i = [(\\mathbf{v}_i - \\mathbf{v}_{i-1 \\bmod 4}) \\times (\\mathbf{v}_{i+1 \\bmod 4} - \\mathbf{v}_i)]_z$.\n-   If all $S_i$ have the same sign (positive for CCW), all turns are \"left\" and the polygon is **convex**.\n-   If one $S_i$ has a different sign (negative for CCW), that vertex corresponds to a \"right\" turn and is a **reflex** vertex. The polygon is **concave**.\n\n**Step 3: Triangulation of Simple Quadrilaterals**\n-   **Concave Case**: If a reflex vertex at index $k$ is found, only one diagonal lies entirely inside the quadrilateral. This diagonal connects the reflex vertex to its opposite, i.e., $(\\mathbf{v}_k, \\mathbf{v}_{k+2 \\bmod 4})$. This is consistent with the problem statement's rule. We split the quadrilateral along this diagonal, forming two triangles: $(\\mathbf{v}_k, \\mathbf{v}_{k+1 \\bmod 4}, \\mathbf{v}_{k+2 \\bmod 4})$ and $(\\mathbf{v}_k, \\mathbf{v}_{k+2 \\bmod 4}, \\mathbf{v}_{k+3 \\bmod 4})$.\n-   **Convex Case**: Both diagonals, $(\\mathbf{v}_0, \\mathbf{v}_2)$ and $(\\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_3)$, lie inside the quadrilateral. We must evaluate both potential splits.\n    -   Split 1 (diagonal $(\\mathbf{v}_0, \\mathbf{v}_2)$): yields triangles $(\\mathbf{v}_0, \\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_2)$ and $(\\mathbf{v}_0, \\mathbf{v}_2, \\mathbf{v}_3)$. We compute the minimum angle $\\theta_{\\min,1}$ among the six angles of these two triangles.\n    -   Split 2 (diagonal $(\\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_3)$): yields triangles $(\\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_2, \\mathbf{v}_3)$ and $(\\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_3, \\mathbf{v}_0)$. We compute the minimum angle $\\theta_{\\min,2}$.\n    -   The optimal choice is the one that maximizes this minimum angle. If $\\theta_{\\min,1} \\ge \\theta_{\\min,2}$, we choose Split 1; otherwise, we choose Split 2.\n\n**Step 4: Refinement based on Angle Quality**\nFor the two-triangle triangulation obtained in Step 3 (for either a concave or convex quadrilateral), we compute its minimum interior angle, $\\theta_{\\min, \\text{initial}}$.\n-   If $\\theta_{\\min, \\text{initial}} < \\Theta_{\\min} = 25.0^{\\circ}$, the triangulation is deemed of poor quality. It is discarded. A new triangulation is generated by introducing a Steiner point at the quadrilateral's centroid, $\\mathbf{c} = \\frac{1}{4}(\\mathbf{v}_0 + \\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathbf{v}_2 + \\mathbf{v}_3)$.\n-   This creates a fan of four triangles: $(\\mathbf{v}_0, \\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{c})$, $(\\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_2, \\mathbf{c})$, $(\\mathbf{v}_2, \\mathbf{v}_3, \\mathbf{c})$, and $(\\mathbf{v}_3, \\mathbf{v}_0, \\mathbf{c})$. This set of four triangles becomes the final triangulation.\n-   If $\\theta_{\\min, \\text{initial}} \\ge \\Theta_{\\min}$, the initial two-triangle split is accepted as the final triangulation.\n\n**Step 5: Final Evaluation**\nOnce the final set of triangles is determined (either from Step 1, or Step 4), we perform a final analysis:\n1.  Count the number of triangles in the set.\n2.  Compute the minimum interior angle across all angles in all triangles.\n3.  Compare this final minimum angle to $\\Theta_{\\min}$ to determine if the triangulation is well-conditioned.\n\nThis structured procedure rigorously follows the problem specification and ensures a unique, principled outcome for any given planar quadrilateral.
