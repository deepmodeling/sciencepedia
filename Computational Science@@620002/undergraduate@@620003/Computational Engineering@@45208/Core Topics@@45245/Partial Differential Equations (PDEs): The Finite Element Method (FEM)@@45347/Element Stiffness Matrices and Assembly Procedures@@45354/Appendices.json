It is scientifically grounded in the theory of the Finite Element Method, it is well-posed with precise definitions, and its formulation is objective. No flaws were identified. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the semi-bandwidth $b$ of the global stiffness matrix $K$ for a regular quadrilateral mesh under three distinct nodal numbering schemes. The semi-bandwidth is defined as $b = 1 + \\max\\{|j - i| : K_{ij} \\neq 0\\}$. The condition $K_{ij} \\neq 0$ is stated to hold if and only if the global nodes with indices $i$ and $j$ are part of at least one common element. Therefore, the task reduces to finding the maximum absolute difference between the indices of any two nodes belonging to the same element, and adding $1$ to this maximum difference.\n\nLet the mesh have $n_y$ rows and $n_x$ columns of nodes. The grid coordinates of a node are $(i, j)$, where $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n_y-1\\}$ is the row index (from top to bottom) and $j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n_x-1\\}$ is the column index (from left to right). A generic four-node ($Q4$) element is defined by the four nodes at its corners. We can identify each element by its top-left corner node at grid position $(r, c)$, where $r \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n_y-2\\}$ and $c \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n_x-2\\}$. The four nodes of such an element are located at grid positions $(r, c)$, $(r, c+1)$, $(r+1, c)$, and $(r+1, c+1)$.\n\nFor a given numbering scheme, let $\\text{idx}(i, j)$ be the global index assigned to the node at grid position $(i, j)$. For an element with its top-left corner at $(r, c)$, the indices of its four nodes are $\\text{idx}(r, c)$, $\\text{idx}(r, c+1)$, $\\text{idx}(r+1, c)$, and $\\text{idx}(r+1, c+1)$. The maximum index difference within this element is $\\Delta_{rc} = \\max(\\text{indices}) - \\min(\\text{indices})$. The global maximum difference is $\\max_{r,c} \\Delta_{rc}$. The semi-bandwidth is then $b = 1 + \\max_{r,c} \\Delta_{rc}$. We will now derive this value for each of the three numbering schemes.\n\n1.  **Row-major numbering**:\n    The index of a node at $(i, j)$ is given by the formula $\\text{idx}(i, j) = i n_x + j$.\n    For an element with its top-left corner at $(r, c)$, the four nodal indices are:\n    - $\\text{idx}(r, c) = r n_x + c$\n    - $\\text{idx}(r, c+1) = r n_x + c + 1$\n    - $\\text{idx}(r+1, c) = (r+1) n_x + c$\n    - $\\text{idx}(r+1, c+1) = (r+1) n_x + c + 1$\n    Since the indices increase with both $r$ and $j$, the minimum index in this set corresponds to the top-left node $(r, c)$ and the maximum index corresponds to the bottom-right node $(r+1, c+1)$.\n    The maximum difference for this element is:\n    $$ \\Delta_{rc} = \\text{idx}(r+1, c+1) - \\text{idx}(r, c) = ((r+1)n_x + c + 1) - (r n_x + c) = n_x + 1 $$\n    This difference, $n_x + 1$, is independent of the element's position $(r, c)$. Thus, the global maximum difference is $n_x + 1$.\n    The semi-bandwidth for the row-major scheme is $b_{\\text{row}} = 1 + (n_x + 1) = n_x + 2$.\n\n2.  **Column-major numbering**:\n    The index of a node at $(i, j)$ is given by $\\text{idx}(i, j) = j n_y + i$.\n    This scheme is analogous to the row-major scheme applied to a transposed grid with dimensions $n_y \\times n_x$. By swapping the roles of $n_x$ and $n_y$ in the row-major analysis, we can directly deduce the result.\n    To be explicit, for an element with its top-left corner at $(r, c)$, the four nodal indices are:\n    - $\\text{idx}(r, c) = c n_y + r$\n    - $\\text{idx}(r, c+1) = (c+1) n_y + r$\n    - $\\text{idx}(r+1, c) = c n_y + r + 1$\n    - $\\text{idx}(r+1, c+1) = (c+1) n_y + r + 1$\n    The minimum index is $\\text{idx}(r, c)$ and the maximum is $\\text{idx}(r+1, c+1)$.\n    The maximum difference for this element is:\n    $$ \\Delta_{rc} = \\text{idx}(r+1, c+1) - \\text{idx}(r, c) = ((c+1)n_y + r + 1) - (c n_y + r) = n_y + 1 $$\n    This is also independent of $(r, c)$. The global maximum difference is $n_y + 1$.\n    The semi-bandwidth for the column-major scheme is $b_{\\text{col}} = 1 + (n_y + 1) = n_y + 2$.\n\n3.  **Zigzag row-wise numbering**:\n    The indexing depends on the parity of the row index $i$.\n    If $i$ is even: $\\text{idx}(i, j) = i n_x + j$.\n    If $i$ is odd: $\\text{idx}(i, j) = i n_x + (n_x - 1 - j)$.\n    We must analyze an element connecting row $r$ and row $r+1$. Two cases arise depending on the parity of $r$.\n\n    Case A: $r$ is an even number.\n    Row $r$ is numbered left-to-right, and row $r+1$ is numbered right-to-left. The four nodal indices for an element with top-left corner $(r, c)$ are:\n    - $\\text{idx}(r, c) = r n_x + c$\n    - $\\text{idx}(r, c+1) = r n_x + c + 1$\n    - $\\text{idx}(r+1, c) = (r+1) n_x + (n_x - 1 - c)$\n    - $\\text{idx}(r+1, c+1) = (r+1) n_x + (n_x - 1 - (c+1)) = (r+1) n_x + n_x - 2 - c$\n    The minimum index in this set is $\\text{idx}(r, c) = r n_x + c$, and the maximum is $\\text{idx}(r+1, c) = (r+1) n_x + n_x - 1 - c$. This holds for all valid $c \\in \\{0, \\dots, n_x-2\\}$.\n    The maximum difference for this element is:\n    $$ \\Delta_{rc} = \\text{idx}(r+1, c) - \\text{idx}(r, c) = ((r+1)n_x + n_x - 1 - c) - (r n_x + c) = 2 n_x - 1 - 2c $$\n    This difference depends on the column $c$. To find the global maximum, we must maximize $\\Delta_{rc}$ over all possible values of $c$. As $2n_x - 1 - 2c$ is a decreasing function of $c$, its maximum occurs at the smallest value of $c$, which is $c=0$. The maximum difference is $2 n_x - 1$.\n\n    Case B: $r$ is an odd number.\n    Row $r$ is numbered right-to-left, and row $r+1$ is numbered left-to-right. The four nodal indices are:\n    - $\\text{idx}(r, c) = r n_x + (n_x - 1 - c)$\n    - $\\text{idx}(r, c+1) = r n_x + n_x - 2 - c$\n    - $\\text{idx}(r+1, c) = (r+1) n_x + c$\n    - $\\text{idx}(r+1, c+1) = (r+1) n_x + c + 1$\n    The minimum index is $\\text{idx}(r, c+1) = r n_x + n_x - 2 - c$, and the maximum is $\\text{idx}(r+1, c+1) = (r+1) n_x + c + 1$. This holds for all valid $c$.\n    The maximum difference for this element is:\n    $$ \\Delta_{rc} = \\text{idx}(r+1, c+1) - \\text{idx}(r, c+1) = ((r+1)n_x + c + 1) - (r n_x + n_x - 2 - c) = 2c + 3 $$\n    This difference, $2c+3$, is an increasing function of $c$. Its maximum occurs at the largest value of $c$, which is $c=n_x-2$. The maximum difference is $2(n_x-2) + 3 = 2n_x - 1$.\n\n    In both cases, the maximum difference encountered is $2n_x - 1$.\n    The semi-bandwidth for the zigzag scheme is $b_{\\text{zig}} = 1 + (2n_x - 1) = 2n_x$.\n\nIn summary, the semi-bandwidths for the three schemes are given by the following simple formulas:\n- Row-major: $b_{\\text{row}} = n_x + 2$\n- Column-major: $b_{\\text{col}} = n_y + 2$\n- Zigzag row-wise: $b_{\\text{zig}} = 2 n_x$\n\nThese formulas will be implemented to solve the given test cases.", "answer": "[[5,5,6],[8,6,12],[12,4,20],[6,9,8],[4,4,4]]", "id": "2388028"}]}
