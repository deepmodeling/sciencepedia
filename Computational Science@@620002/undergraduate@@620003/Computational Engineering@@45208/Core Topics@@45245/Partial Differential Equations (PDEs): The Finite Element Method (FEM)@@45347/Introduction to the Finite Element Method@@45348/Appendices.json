It describes a classic scenario in FEM. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe displacement field $\\mathbf{u}(x, y)$ within a $4$-node isoparametric element is interpolated from the nodal displacements $\\mathbf{d}$ using bilinear shape functions $N_i$:\n$$ \\mathbf{u} = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} N_i \\mathbf{u}_i $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{u}_i = \\{u_i, v_i\\}^T$ is the displacement vector at node $i$, and $\\mathbf{d} = \\{u_1, v_1, u_2, v_2, u_3, v_3, u_4, v_4\\}^T$ is the element's nodal displacement vector of size $8 \\times 1$.\n\nThe infinitesimal strain vector in a $2$D plane-stress problem is $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} = \\{\\epsilon_x, \\epsilon_y, \\gamma_{xy}\\}^T$. It is derived from the displacement field as $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} = \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{u}$, where $\\mathbf{L}$ is the differential operator matrix. In the finite element formulation, this relationship is expressed as:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} = \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{d} $$\nHere, $\\mathbf{B}$ is the $3 \\times 8$ strain-displacement matrix, whose columns are derived from the spatial derivatives of the shape functions.\n\nThe element stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}_e$ is computed by integrating over the element volume $V$:\n$$ \\mathbf{K}_e = \\int_V \\mathbf{B}^T \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{B} \\, dV $$\nThe problem specifies reduced integration using a single Gauss point at the element centroid. For a square element in the physical domain, this corresponds to the point $(\\xi, \\eta) = (0, 0)$ in the natural coordinate system. The integral is thus approximated as:\n$$ \\mathbf{K}_e \\approx A \\cdot t \\cdot (\\mathbf{B}(0,0))^T \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{B}(0,0) $$\nwhere $A$ is the element area, $t$ is its thickness, and $\\mathbf{B}(0,0)$ is the strain-displacement matrix evaluated at the centroid.\n\nThe element's internal strain energy is $U_e = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{d}^T \\mathbf{K}_e \\mathbf{d}$. A zero-energy mode is a non-zero nodal displacement vector $\\mathbf{d}_{ze}$ that results in zero strain energy, $U_e = 0$. Given that the material constitutive matrix $\\mathbf{D}$ is positive-definite and the element has a positive volume, the condition $U_e=0$ is equivalent to:\n$$ \\mathbf{B}(0,0) \\mathbf{d}_{ze} = \\mathbf{0} $$\nThis means that zero-energy modes are the vectors that form the null space of the matrix $\\mathbf{B}(0,0)$.\n\nThe total number of degrees of freedom for the element is $4 \\text{ nodes} \\times 2 \\text{ DOF/node} = 8$. The matrix $\\mathbf{B}(0,0)$ has dimensions $3 \\times 8$. The rank of this matrix corresponds to the number of independent strain states that the element can represent when evaluated at the centroid. For a bilinear element, the three constant strain states ($\\epsilon_x=c_1, \\epsilon_y=c_2, \\gamma_{xy}=c_3$) are linearly independent, and the $\\mathbf{B}(0,0)$ matrix correctly captures these. Therefore, the rank of $\\mathbf{B}(0,0)$ is $3$.\n\nAccording to the rank-nullity theorem, the dimension of the null space of $\\mathbf{B}(0,0)$ is:\n$$ \\text{dim}(\\text{null}(\\mathbf{B}(0,0))) = (\\text{Number of columns}) - \\text{rank}(\\mathbf{B}(0,0)) = 8 - 3 = 5 $$\nThus, there are $5$ linearly independent displacement modes that produce zero strain *at the element centroid*.\n\nAny valid element must be able to undergo rigid-body motion without generating any strain or stress. In $2$D, there are $3$ rigid-body modes: two translations (in $x$ and $y$) and one in-plane rotation. These three modes are necessarily a part of the $5$-dimensional null space.\n\nThe remaining zero-energy modes are spurious, non-physical deformation modes, which are artifacts of the numerical integration scheme. These are the hourglass modes. Their number is:\n$$ \\text{Number of hourglass modes} = (\\text{Total zero-energy modes}) - (\\text{Rigid-body modes}) = 5 - 3 = 2 $$\nThese modes are typically alternating nodal displacement patterns which, by their nature, produce deformation within the element but have derivatives that are zero at the centroid. Thus, the single Gauss point fails to detect the strain, leading to zero computed strain energy. This makes the element artificially soft for these deformation patterns and can corrupt the global solution.\n\n**Analysis of Options**\n\n**A. Because $1$-point quadrature evaluates the strain only at the element centroid, certain alternating nodal displacement patterns produce zero strain at that single point even though the element deforms, yielding zero internal energy and a rank-deficient element stiffness. For an undistorted bilinear $4$-node quadrilateral in $2$D, there are exactly $2$ independent hourglass modes.**\nThis statement correctly identifies the mechanism: strain is evaluated only at one point, which is insensitive to certain deformation patterns (hourglass modes). It correctly states that this leads to zero strain energy and a rank-deficient stiffness matrix (beyond the rank deficiency due to rigid-body modes). The number of independent hourglass modes for this specific element is correctly stated as $2$. This option is fully consistent with the derivation. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Hourglassing occurs because reduced integration violates the patch test, making the element artificially too stiff (locking). Any non-rigid deformation has strictly positive internal energy, so no spurious zero-energy patterns exist.**\nThis is incorrect. Reduced integration is specifically used to pass the patch test for distorted elements and to *combat* locking (which makes an element too stiff). Hourglassing makes the element too *soft* for certain modes, which is the opposite of locking. The very definition of hourglassing is the existence of spurious zero-energy patterns. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Hourglassing is solely a consequence of geometric distortion; a perfect square $4$-node quadrilateral integrated with a single Gauss point has no hourglass modes.**\nThis is incorrect. The derivation above demonstrates that hourglassing occurs even for a perfect, undistorted square element. The cause is under-integration (sampling the strain field at too few points), not geometric distortion. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Hourglassing arises from material near-incompressibility; it is removed by using $1$-point quadrature, which eliminates all spurious modes in $2$D bilinear quadrilaterals.**\nThis statement conflates locking with hourglassing. Volumetric locking arises from near-incompressibility, and reduced integration is a method to *alleviate* it. Hourglassing is an undesirable *side effect* of this remedy. Therefore, $1$-point quadrature *causes* hourglassing; it does not remove or eliminate it. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Hourglassing occurs because bilinear $4$-node quadrilateral shape functions are nonconforming and cannot reproduce rigid-body motion, which leads to spurious zero-energy modes under any quadrature rule.**\nThis is incorrect on multiple grounds. Standard isoparametric bilinear elements are conforming. They correctly reproduce rigid-body motion with zero strain. Hourglassing is a characteristic of *reduced* integration, not of the element or its shape functions under *any* quadrature rule. Full $2 \\times 2$ integration for this element does not produce hourglass modes. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2405113"}]}
