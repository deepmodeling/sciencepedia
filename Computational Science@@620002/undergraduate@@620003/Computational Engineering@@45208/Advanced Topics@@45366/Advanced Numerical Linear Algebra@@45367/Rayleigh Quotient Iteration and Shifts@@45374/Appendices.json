Since $x_2=x_0$, it must be that $x_3=x_1$. By induction, $x_{k+2} = x_k$ for all $k \\ge 0$.\nThe problem asks for the minimal positive integer $p$ such that $x_{k+p} = x_{k}$ for all $k \\ge 0$. We have found that $p=2$ works.\nWe must check if $p=1$ is a valid period. This would require $x_{k+1} = x_k$ for all $k$. For $k=0$, this means $x_1 = x_0$.

The problem is well-structured and not ill-posed.\n    6.  The result is scientifically verifiable by independent implementation and execution of the specified algorithm.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the implementation of the Rayleigh quotient iteration (RQI) algorithm to approximate an eigenpair of a given complex Hermitian matrix and to empirically estimate its order of convergence.\n\nThe Rayleigh quotient iteration is a powerful method derived from inverse iteration. Standard inverse iteration finds the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue closest to a fixed shift $\\sigma$. It computes $v_{k+1}$ by solving $(A - \\sigma I)w_k = v_k$ and normalizing. RQI enhances this by using an adaptive shift: at each step $k$, the shift is updated to be the current best estimate of the eigenvalue, which is the Rayleigh quotient $\\mu_k = \\mu(v_k) = (v_k)^* A v_k / (v_k)^* v_k$. Since we enforce $\\|v_k\\|_2=1$, this simplifies to $\\mu_k = (v_k)^* A v_k$. This adaptive shifting strategy results in exceptionally rapid local convergence. For a Hermitian matrix, the convergence rate is typically cubic, a significant improvement over the linear convergence of the power method or the fixed-shift inverse iteration.\n\nThe procedure for each test case is as follows:\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    - Given the matrix $B$, the corresponding Hermitian matrix $A$ is constructed using the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}(B + B^*)$, where $B^*$ is the conjugate transpose of $B$. This construction guarantees that $A$ is Hermitian, i.e., $A = A^*$.\n    - The provided initial vector $v_{0, \\text{raw}}$ is normalized to have a unit $2$-norm: $v_0 = v_{0, \\text{raw}} / \\|v_{0, \\text{raw}}\\|_2$.\n    - A history of iterate vectors, `vs`, is initialized to store each $v_k$.\n\n2.  **Iterative Process**:\n    - The iteration proceeds for $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ up to a maximum of $m-1 = 49$.\n    - At each step $k$, the current vector $v_k$ is stored.\n    - The Rayleigh quotient $\\mu_k = (v_k)^* A v_k$ is computed.\n    - The termination condition is checked by computing the norm of the residual vector, $r_k = A v_k - \\mu_k v_k$. If $\\|r_k\\|_2 \\le \\tau = 10^{-12}$, the iteration terminates.\n    - If the condition is not met, the next iterate is computed. This involves solving the shifted linear system $(A - \\mu_k I) w_k = v_k$ for the vector $w_k$. The matrix $A - \\mu_k I$ is guaranteed to be Hermitian but may be indefinite. A general linear solver is used for this purpose. If this matrix is numerically singular, it indicates that $\\mu_k$ is an excellent approximation of an eigenvalue, and the iteration can be terminated.\n    - The subsequent vector iterate $v_{k+1}$ is obtained by normalizing $w_k$: $v_{k+1} = w_k / \\|w_k\\|_2$.\n    - The process repeats with the updated vector $v_{k+1}$.\n\n3.  **Post-Iteration Analysis and Convergence Estimation**:\n    - Upon termination at iteration $K$, the final state is described by the approximate eigenpair $(\\mu_K, v_K)$. To estimate the convergence order, we must compare the iterates against the true eigenpair.\n    - The full eigensystem of the matrix $A$ is computed. Since $A$ is Hermitian, its eigenvalues are real, and its eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis.\n    - The true eigenvalue $\\lambda_\\star$ closest to the final computed Rayleigh quotient $\\mu_K$ is identified by minimizing the absolute difference $|\\lambda_j - \\mu_K|$ over all eigenvalues $\\lambda_j$ of $A$.\n    - The corresponding unit-norm eigenvector $x_\\star$ is retrieved.\n    - A sequence of errors $\\{e_k\\}$ is computed for all stored iterates $v_k$ using the formula $e_k = \\sqrt{1 - |(x_\\star)^* v_k|^2}$. This error represents the sine of the angle between the iterate $v_k$ and the true eigenvector $x_\\star$.\n    - To estimate the convergence order $p$, we seek the last three consecutive errors in the sequence, say at indices $j-2, j-1, j$, that are all strictly positive and finite. Let these be $e_{j-2}, e_{j-1}, e_j$. The order $p$ is then estimated as $p \\approx \\frac{\\ln(e_j/e_{j-1})}{\\ln(e_{j-1}/e_{j-2})}$.\n    - If the iteration converges so rapidly that fewer than three such qualifying errors are generated, a definitive estimate cannot be computed. In this scenario, as per the problem specification, we return the theoretically expected value for RQI on a Hermitian matrix, which is $p=3$.\n\nThis comprehensive procedure is applied to each test case to yield the estimated local order of convergence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{[2.9972, 3.0000, 2.9998]}$$", "id": "2431729"}]}
