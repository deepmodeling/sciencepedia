First, we state the theorem.\n\nThe Gershgorin Circle Theorem: For a complex $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ with entries $a_{ij}$, let $R_i = \\sum_{j \\neq i} |a_{ij}|$ be the sum of the absolute values of the non-diagonal entries in the $i$-th row. Let $D(a_{ii}, R_i)$ be the closed disk in the complex plane centered at $a_{ii}$ with radius $R_i$. The theorem states that every eigenvalue of $A$ lies within at least one of these Gershgorin disks $D(a_{ii}, R_i)$. In other words, the spectrum of $A$, denoted $\\sigma(A)$, is a subset of the union of these disks:\n$$\n\\sigma(A) \\subseteq \\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} D(a_{ii}, R_i)\n$$\nwhere $D(a_{ii}, R_i) = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z - a_{ii}| \\le R_i\\}$.\n\nWe now apply this theorem to the given matrix $A$. The matrix is a $3 \\times 3$ real matrix, so we will define three row-based Gershgorin disks.\n\nFor the first row ($i=1$):\nThe center is the diagonal element $a_{11} = -3$.\nThe radius is the sum of the absolute values of the off-diagonal elements in that row: $R_1 = |a_{12}| + |a_{13}| = |1| + |0| = 1$.\nThe first Gershgorin disk is $D_1 = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z - (-3)| \\le 1\\}$.\n\nFor the second row ($i=2$):\nThe center is $a_{22} = -4$.\nThe radius is $R_2 = |a_{21}| + |a_{23}| = |2| + |1| = 3$.\nThe second Gershgorin disk is $D_2 = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z - (-4)| \\le 3\\}$.\n\nFor the third row ($i=3$):\nThe center is $a_{33} = -2$.\nThe radius is $R_3 = |a_{31}| + |a_{32}| = |0| + |1| = 1$.\nThe third Gershgorin disk is $D_3 = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z - (-2)| \\le 1\\}$.\n\nThe theorem guarantees that all eigenvalues of $A$ lie in the union of these three disks, $G = D_1 \\cup D_2 \\cup D_3$.\n\nThe first part of the problem asks whether the theorem ensures that $A$ is Hurwitz. A matrix is Hurwitz if all its eigenvalues have strictly negative real parts. Let $\\lambda$ be any eigenvalue of $A$. Then $\\lambda \\in G$. The real part of any point $z$ in a disk $D(c, R)$ with a real center $c$ is bounded by $c - R \\le \\Re(z) \\le c + R$. We seek an upper bound for the real part of any eigenvalue.\nFor any $\\lambda \\in \\sigma(A)$, we have $\\Re(\\lambda) \\le \\sup\\{\\Re(z) : z \\in G\\}$. This supremum is given by the maximum of the rightmost points of the three disks:\n$$\n\\sup\\{\\Re(z) : z \\in G\\} = \\max(a_{11} + R_1, a_{22} + R_2, a_{33} + R_3)\n$$\nCalculating these values:\nFor $D_1$: $-3 + 1 = -2$.\nFor $D_2$: $-4 + 3 = -1$.\nFor $D_3$: $-2 + 1 = -1$.\n\nThe maximum of these values is $\\max(-2, -1, -1) = -1$. This means that for any eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of $A$, the Gershgorin circle theorem implies $\\Re(\\lambda) \\le -1$. Since $-1  0$, the theorem guarantees that all eigenvalues have strictly negative real parts. Therefore, the theorem does ensure that the matrix $A$ is Hurwitz and does not leave open the possibility of eigenvalues with nonnegative real parts.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the tightest upper bound on the spectral abscissa, $\\alpha(A) = \\sup\\{\\Re(\\lambda) : \\lambda \\in \\sigma(A)\\}$, that can be derived directly from the union of these row-based disks. This is explicitly defined in the problem as the largest real number attained on the real axis by the union of the disks. This value is precisely the maximum of the rightmost points of the disks' intersections with the real axis, which we have already computed.\nThe region on the real axis covered by the union of the disks is the union of the intervals $[a_{ii} - R_i, a_{ii} + R_i]$:\n- For $D_1$: $[-3 - 1, -3 + 1] = [-4, -2]$.\n- For $D_2$: $[-4 - 3, -4 + 3] = [-7, -1]$.\n- For $D_3$: $[-2 - 1, -2 + 1] = [-3, -1]$.\nThe union of these intervals is $[-7, -1]$. The largest real number in this union is $-1$.\nThus, the tightest upper bound on $\\alpha(A)$ that follows from the row-based Gershgorin disks is $-1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-1}\n$$", "id": "2704012"}, {"introduction": "While our first exercise demonstrated the utility of Gershgorin disks, the initial bounds obtained are often just a starting point.

For any $x  0$, we have $7+2x = (6+x) + (1+x)$. Since $1+x  1$, it follows that $7+2x  6+x$ for all $x  0$.

Let's find these intersection points.\n\n1. Intersection of $f_1(x)$ and $f_2(x)$:\n$5 + \\frac{4}{x} = 7 + 2x \\implies \\frac{4}{x} = 2 + 2x \\implies 4 = 2x + 2x^2$.\n$2x^2 + 2x - 4 = 0 \\implies x^2 + x - 2 = 0$.\nFactoring the quadratic equation gives $(x-1)(x+2) = 0$. Since we require $x  0$, the only valid solution is $x=1$. At this point, $f_1(1) = 5+4 = 9$ and $f_2(1) = 7+2 = 9$.\n\n2. Intersection of $f_1(x)$ and $f_3(x)$:\n$5 + \\frac{4}{x} = 8 \\implies \\frac{4}{x} = 3 \\implies x = \\frac{4}{3}$.\n\n3. Intersection of $f_2(x)$ and $f_3(x)$:\n$7 + 2x = 8 \\implies 2x = 1 \\implies x = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nLet us analyze the behavior of $U(x)$ based on these critical points.\nConsider the function $V(x) = \\max\\{f_1(x), f_2(x)\\} = \\max\\{5+\\frac{4}{x}, 7+2x\\}$. Since $f_1(x)$ is decreasing and $f_2(x)$ is increasing, the minimum of $V(x)$ occurs at their intersection, $x=1$, where $V(1)=9$.\nFor $x \\le 1$, $x \\le 1 \\implies \\frac{1}{x} \\ge 1 \\implies 5+\\frac{4}{x} \\ge 9$. So $V(x) = 5+\\frac{4}{x} \\ge 9$.\nFor $x \\ge 1$, $x \\ge 1 \\implies 7+2x \\ge 9$. So $V(x) = 7+2x \\ge 9$.\nThus, $V(x) \\ge 9$ for all $x  0$.\n\nNow, $U(x) = \\max\\{V(x), 8\\}$. Since $V(x) \\ge 9$ for all $x  0$, it is always true that $V(x)  8$.\nTherefore, $U(x) = V(x) = \\max\\{5+\\frac{4}{x}, 7+2x\\}$.\n\nThe problem is reduced to finding the minimum of $U(x)$. As established, this function is composed of a decreasing part ($5+\\frac{4}{x}$ for $0  x \\le 1$) and an increasing part ($7+2x$ for $x \\ge 1$). The global minimum is at the transition point, which is $x=1$.\n\nThe value of the minimum is $U(1) = \\max\\{9, 9, 8\\} = 9$.

Therefore, we have:\n$$\na_{11} = c_1 = 0\n$$\n$$\na_{22} = c_2 = 4\n$$\n$$\na_{33} = c_3 = 7\n$$\nThe radii of the Gershgorin disks are defined as the sum of the absolute values of the off-diagonal entries in each row. The problem states that $A$ is a real matrix with nonnegative off-diagonal entries ($a_{ij} \\geq 0$ for $i \\neq j$). This simplifies the radius definition to $R_i = \\sum_{j \\neq i} a_{ij}$. Equating these with the given radii yields:\n$$\nR_1 = a_{12} + a_{13} = r_1 = \\frac{3}{5}\n$$\n$$\nR_2 = a_{21} + a_{23} = r_2 = \\frac{7}{10}\n$$\n$$\nR_3 = a_{31} + a_{32} = r_3 = \\frac{9}{10}\n$$\nThe matrix $A$ is also required to be symmetric, meaning $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$. Applying this condition to the equations for the radii gives a system of three linear equations for the three unique off-diagonal elements $a_{12}$, $a_{13}$, and $a_{23}$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\na_{12} + a_{13} = \\frac{3}{5}  (1) \\\\\na_{12} + a_{23} = \\frac{7}{10}  (2) \\\\\na_{13} + a_{23} = \\frac{9}{10}  (3)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis system can be solved straightforwardly.

To express it with four significant figures, we add two trailing zeros.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-0.8400}\n$$", "id": "2396965"}]}
