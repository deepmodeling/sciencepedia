This foundational skill is non-negotiable for anyone writing serious geometric code.", "problem": "You are implementing a geometric kernel for two-dimensional unstructured meshing to be used in both Delaunay triangulation and advancing-front mesh generation. A core primitive is the orientation predicate, which determines whether three points $p = (p_x,p_y)$, $q = (q_x,q_y)$, and $r = (r_x,r_y)$ are oriented counterclockwise, clockwise, or are collinear.

The core of the task is to manage floating-point numerical errors that arise when points are nearly collinear. The problem mandates an adaptive approach: a fast, standard floating-point computation is used when the result is numerically stable, and a slower, mathematically exact computation based on floating-point expansions is used otherwise.\n\nThe orientation of three points $p=(p_x, p_y)$, $q=(q_x, q_y)$, and $r=(r_x, r_y)$ is given by the sign of the determinant $D$:\n$$\nD = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} q_x - p_x & q_y - p_y \\\\ r_x - p_x & r_y - p_y \\end{pmatrix} = (q_x - p_x)(r_y - p_y) - (q_y - p_y)(r_x - p_x)\n$$\nA positive sign indicates counter-clockwise (CCW) orientation, a negative sign indicates clockwise (CW), and a value of zero indicates collinearity.\n\nThe solution is implemented as a two-stage process: a filter and an exact computation stage.\n\n**Stage 1: The Adaptive Filter**\n\nThis stage performs the determinant calculation using standard `IEEE 754` double-precision floating-point arithmetic. Let $\\hat{D}$ be the computed value of the determinant $D$. Due to rounding errors, $\\hat{D}$ may differ from the true value $D$. We must establish a bound on the absolute error $|\\hat{D} - D|$. If the magnitude of the computed determinant $|\\hat{D}|$ is greater than this error bound, its sign is guaranteed to be correct.\n\nTo derive the error bound, we model a floating-point operation $\\circ$ as $\\text{fl}(a \\circ b) = (a \\circ b)(1 + \\delta)$, where $|\\delta| \\le u$, and $u=2^{-53}$ is the unit roundoff for double precision.\nThe determinant expression $D = (q_x - p_x)(r_y - p_y) - (q_y - p_y)(r_x - p_x)$ involves five arithmetic operations: four subtractions to form the differences and two products, followed by a final subtraction.\nLet $T_1 = (q_x - p_x)(r_y - p_y)$ and $T_2 = (q_y - p_y)(r_x - p_x)$.\nThe computation of $\\hat{T}_1$ from the original coordinates involves two subtractions and one multiplication. A first-order analysis shows that the absolute error $|\\hat{T}_1 - T_1|$ is bounded by approximately $3u|T_1|$. This arises from summing the potential relative error contributions of each operation. Similarly, $|\\hat{T}_2 - T_2|$ is bounded by $3u|T_2|$.\nThe final computed determinant is $\\hat{D} = \\text{fl}(\\hat{T}_1 - \\hat{T}_2) = (\\hat{T}_1 - \\hat{T}_2)(1 + \\delta_D)$, where $|\\delta_D| \\le u$.\nThe total error is $\\hat{D} - D = (\\hat{T}_1 - T_1) - (\\hat{T}_2 - T_2) + \\delta_D(\\hat{T}_1 - \\hat{T}_2)$.\nThe absolute error is thus bounded:\n$$\n|\\hat{D} - D| \\le |\\hat{T}_1 - T_1| + |\\hat{T}_2 - T_2| + u|\\hat{T}_1 - \\hat{T}_2|\n$$\nSubstituting the bounds for the terms and noting that for near-collinear cases $|\\hat{D}|$ is small, the error is dominated by the errors in the terms $T_1$ and $T_2$. This yields a sound, albeit slightly conservative, error bound $\\epsilon$:\n$$ \\epsilon \\approx 3u \\cdot (|\\hat{T}_1| + |\\hat{T}_2|) $$\nThe filter is thus: if $|\\hat{D}| > \\epsilon$, the sign of $\\hat{D}$ is correct. Otherwise, we proceed to the exact stage.\n\n**Stage 2: Exact Sign Computation via Floating-Point Expansions**\n\nWhen the filter fails, the points are nearly collinear, and catastrophic cancellation in the standard computation prevents determining the sign reliably. To find the exact sign, we use floating-point expansion arithmetic. A floating-point expansion represents a high-precision number as a sum of standard, non-overlapping floating-point numbers.\n\nThis method relies on \"Error-Free Transformations\" (EFTs), which are algorithms that compute the result of a basic arithmetic operation and the exact rounding error it generated. For this problem, we need:\n1.  `two_sum(a, b)`: Computes $s = \\text{fl}(a+b)$ and $e$ such that $s+e = a+b$ exactly.\n2.  `two_prod(a, b)`: Computes $p = \\text{fl}(a \\times b)$ and $e$ such that $p+e = a \\times b$ exactly.\n\nTo avoid any loss of precision, we do not use the difference terms from the filter. Instead, we use the equivalent expanded form of the determinant:\n$$\nD = (q_x r_y - q_y r_x) + (r_x p_y - r_y p_x) + (p_x q_y - p_y q_x)\n$$\nThis expression consists of six products and five additions/subtractions. The exact computation proceeds as follows:\n1.  For each of the six products (e.g., $q_x r_y$), we use `two_prod` to compute a two-component expansion (e.g., $(p_1, e_1)$ such that $p_1+e_1 = q_x r_y$). This results in a set of $12$ floating-point numbers that, when summed, exactly equal the determinant $D$.\n2.  These $12$ numbers are summed into a single non-overlapping floating-point expansion using an algorithm, `grow_expansion`, which is built upon `two_sum`. This process accumulates the terms without losing any information.\n3.  The final result is an expansion, which is a list of non-overlapping floats, sorted by magnitude. The sign of the true determinant is simply the sign of the most significant component of this expansion (the last element in the list). If all components are zero, the determinant is exactly zero, and the points are collinear.\n\nThis adaptive strategy ensures correctness for all inputs while maintaining high performance for the common, non-degenerate cases.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n# from scipy import ...\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main solver function that defines test cases and computes the orientation for each.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- GLOBAL CONSTANTS ---\n    # Unit roundoff for IEEE 754 double precision (float64).\n    EPSILON = 2**-53\n    # A constant used for splitting a double-precision number. s = ceil(53 / 2) = 27.\n    SPLITTER = (1 << 27) + 1\n\n    # --- ERROR-FREE TRANSFORMATIONS (EFTs) ---\n\n    def two_sum(a: float, b: float) -> tuple[float, float]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes s = a + b and the roundoff error e, such that s + e is exactly a + b.\n        This is the generic, non-sorted version (Møller-Knuth).\n        \"\"\"\n        s = a + b\n        v = s - a\n        e = (a - (s - v)) + (b - v)\n        return s, e\n\n    def split(a: float) -> tuple[float, float]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Splits a double-precision float `a` into two non-overlapping floats `a_hi` and `a_lo`.\n        \"\"\"\n        c = SPLITTER * a\n        a_hi = c - (c - a)\n        a_lo = a - a_hi\n        return a_hi, a_lo\n\n    def two_prod(a: float, b: float) -> tuple[float, float]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes p = a * b and the roundoff error e, such that p + e is exactly a * b.\n        This implementation uses Dekker's algorithm.\n        \"\"\"\n        p = a * b\n        a_hi, a_lo = split(a)\n        b_hi, b_lo = split(b)\n        err1 = p - (a_hi * b_hi)\n        err2 = err1 - (a_lo * b_hi)\n        err3 = err2 - (a_hi * b_lo)\n        e = (a_lo * b_lo) - err3\n        return p, e\n\n    # --- FLOATING-POINT EXPANSION ARITHMETIC ---\n\n    def grow_expansion(e: list[float], b: float) -> list[float]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Adds a float `b` to a non-overlapping expansion `e`, producing a new non-overlapping expansion.\n        The input expansion `e` must be sorted by magnitude, smallest first.\n        \"\"\"\n        h = []\n        Q = b\n        for e_i in e:\n            Q, q = two_sum(Q, e_i)\n            if q != 0.0:\n                h.append(q)\n        if Q != 0.0 or not h:\n            h.append(Q)\n        return h\n\n    def get_expansion_sign(e: list[float]) -> int:\n        \"\"\"\n        Returns the sign of a floating-point expansion.

This is an essential tool for debugging and validating mesh generation codes.", "problem": "You are given a finite set of planar points and a triangulation over those points (no edges cross, and every face of the planar straight-line graph is a triangle except the outer face). Your task is to develop a certification algorithm that, in time $O(N)$ where $N$ is the total size of the triangulation, verifies whether the triangulation satisfies the Delaunay property on the given points. The algorithm must rely only on the fundamental geometric definition of a Delaunay triangulation and basic coordinate geometry, without using any precomputed Delaunay structure or flipping. In particular:\n\n- Fundamental base:\n  - The Delaunay property is defined by the empty circumcircle condition: for every triangle, no vertex of the triangulation lies strictly inside its circumcircle.\n  - In a triangulation, it is sufficient to enforce the empty circumcircle condition via local checks across every interior edge: an interior edge shared by two triangles is valid if and only if neither opposite vertex lies strictly inside the circumcircle of the other triangle.\n  - The orientation (signed area) of three points $(x,y)$ in the plane is determined from coordinate geometry.\n\n- Requirements:\n  1.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It presents a clear, formal problem in computational geometry with sufficient information for its resolution. We may, therefore, proceed with the derivation of a solution.\n\nThe task is to design an algorithm with a time complexity of $O(N)$ to certify whether a given planar triangulation is Delaunay, where $N$ is a measure of the input size, such as the number of vertices. The certification is based on the local Delaunay property, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for a triangulation to be globally Delaunay. This property dictates that for any interior edge shared by two triangles, say $\\triangle(p_i, p_j, p_k)$ and $\\triangle(p_j, p_i, p_l)$, the vertex $p_l$ must not lie strictly inside the circumcircle of $\\triangle(p_i, p_j, p_k)$, and similarly, $p_k$ must not lie strictly inside the circumcircle of $\\triangle(p_j, p_i, p_l)$. Configurations where a vertex lies exactly on the circumcircle are considered valid (weakly Delaunay).\n\nThe overall algorithm proceeds in two main stages:\n\n$1$. Construction of an adjacency data structure to identify interior edges and their corresponding triangles.\n$2$. Iteration over all interior edges to perform the local Delaunay check using a geometric predicate.\n\nLet us detail these stages.\n\n**Stage $1$: Building an Edge-to-Triangle Incidence Map**\n\nA linear-time algorithm requires efficient access to the pair of triangles associated with each interior edge. We can achieve this by constructing a map, or dictionary, where keys represent edges and values store the indices of triangles incident to that edge.\n\nThe input is a set of points $P = \\{p_0, p_1, \\dots, p_{n-1}\\}$ and a list of triangles $T = \\{t_0, t_1, \\dots, t_{m-1}\\}$, where each triangle $t_r = (i, j, k)$ is a tuple of indices into the point set $P$.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n- Initialize an empty dictionary, `edge_to_triangles`.\n- Iterate through each triangle $t_r = (i, j, k)$ in the list $T$ at index $r$, where $r \\in \\{0, \\dots, m-1\\}$.\n- For each triangle, identify its three edges: $(i, j)$, $(j, k)$, and $(k, i)$.\n- To handle unordered edges consistently, we define a canonical representation for each edge. A suitable choice is a sorted tuple of its vertex indices. For an edge between vertices with indices $u$ and $v$, the canonical key is $(\\min(u, v), \\max(u, v))$.\n- For each edge of $t_r$, update the map: append the triangle index $r$ to the list associated with the edge's canonical key.\n\nThis procedure examines each of the $3m$ edges of the $m$ triangles once. The map operations (insertion and lookup) take, on average, constant time, $O(1)$. Thus, the total time to construct the `edge_to_triangles` map is $O(m)$. For a planar graph, the number of triangles $m$ and edges is linearly proportional to the number of vertices $n$, assuming $n > 2$. Therefore, the complexity is $O(N)$.\n\nAfter construction, an edge is identified as an interior edge if its key in the map is associated with a list of exactly two triangle indices. Boundary edges will have one associated triangle index.\n\n**Stage $2$: Local Delaunay Certification via the In-Circle Test**\n\nWith the incidence map, we iterate through its entries. For each entry corresponding to an interior edge, let the edge be $e = (i, j)$ and its associated triangles be $t_a$ and $t_b$. Let the third vertex of $t_a$ be $k$ and the third vertex of $t_b$ be $l$. We must perform two checks:\n$1$. Is vertex $p_l$ located strictly inside the circumcircle of $\\triangle(p_i, p_j, p_k)$?\n$2$. Is vertex $p_k$ located strictly inside the circumcircle of $\\triangle(p_i, p_j, p_l)$?\n\nIf either of these conditions is met, the edge $(i, j)$ is \"illegal\", and the triangulation is not Delaunay. The certification fails, and the algorithm can terminate immediately, returning `false`. If all interior edges are checked and none are found to be illegal, the triangulation is certified as Delaunay, and the algorithm returns `true`.\n\nThe core of this stage is the \"in-circle\" geometric predicate. Given four points $A=(x_a, y_a)$, $B=(x_b, y_b)$, $C=(x_c, y_c)$, and a test point $D=(x_d, y_d)$, this predicate determines the position of $D$ relative to the circumcircle of $\\triangle ABC$. A standard and robust method to implement this predicate without computing the circumcenter or radius explicitly is to evaluate the sign of a determinant.\n\nThe points $A, B, C, D$ are co-circular or collinear if and only if the following determinant is zero:\n$$\n\\text{InCircle}(A,B,C,D) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\nx_a & y_a & x_a^2 + y_a^2 & 1 \\\\\nx_b & y_b & x_b^2 + y_b^2 & 1 \\\\\nx_c & y_c & x_c^2 + y_c^2 & 1 \\\\\nx_d & y_d & x_d^2 + y_d^2 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe sign of this determinant depends on the orientation of the triangle $\\triangle ABC$. To create a consistent test, we first consider the orientation of $\\triangle ABC$, which is given by the sign of another determinant:\n$$\n\\text{Orientation}(A,B,C) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\nx_a & y_a & 1 \\\\\nx_b & y_b & 1 \\\\\nx_c & y_c & 1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix} = (x_b-x_a)(y_c-y_a) - (x_c-x_a)(y_b-y_a)\n$$\nA positive sign indicates a counter-clockwise (CCW) orientation, a negative sign indicates a clockwise (CW) orientation, and zero indicates collinearity.\n\nAssuming $\\triangle ABC$ has a CCW orientation (i.e., $\\text{Orientation}(A,B,C) > 0$), the sign of $\\text{InCircle}(A,B,C,D)$ has the following interpretation:\n- $\\text{InCircle} > 0$: $D$ is strictly inside the circumcircle.\n- $\\text{InCircle} = 0$: $D$ is on the circumcircle.\n- $\\text{InCircle} < 0$: $D$ is strictly outside the circumcircle.\n\nIf $\\triangle ABC$ has a CW orientation, the signs are reversed. A general test for strict interior placement, independent of the triangle's orientation, is thus: $\\text{Orientation}(A,B,C) \\times \\text{InCircle}(A,B,C,D) > 0$.\n\nFor improved numerical stability, the $\\text{InCircle}$ determinant is typically computed by translating the coordinate system so that point $D$ is at the origin. Let $A' = A-D$, $B' = B-D$, and $C' = C-D$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\text{InCircle}(A,B,C,D) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\nx_{a'} & y_{a'} & x_{a'}^2+y_{a'}^2 \\\\\nx_{b'} & y_{b'} & x_{b'}^2+y_{b'}^2 \\\\\nx_{c'} & y_{c'} & x_{c'}^2+y_{c'}^2 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe define a violation of the Delaunay condition if $\\text{Orientation} \\times \\text{InCircle}$ is greater than a small positive tolerance $\\epsilon$ to account for floating-point inaccuracies. A value close to zero (within $[-\\epsilon, \\epsilon]$) corresponds to a co-circular configuration, which is considered valid.\n\nThe overall complexity of Stage $2$ involves iterating over at most $O(N)$ interior edges and performing a constant number of $O(1)$ determinant calculations for each. Thus, Stage $2$ is also $O(N)$. The entire algorithm is therefore $O(N)$, satisfying the problem requirements.

This final practice elevates our skills into the domain of guaranteed-quality meshing by implementing a refinement algorithm inspired by the seminal work of Jim Ruppert. You will learn to strategically insert Steiner points to eliminate poorly-shaped triangles, thereby guaranteeing a minimum angle bound and producing a high-quality mesh ready for accurate simulation [@problem_id:2383854].", "problem": "You are given the task of designing and implementing a two-dimensional mesh refinement algorithm that guarantees a user-specified lower bound on the minimum interior angle of every triangle in a triangulation of a convex polygonal domain by controlled insertion of Steiner points. The algorithm must be based on the Delaunay triangulation and the empty circumcircle property. The goal is to demonstrate an algorithmic approach that leverages fundamental geometric properties to produce well-shaped triangles.\n\nDefinitions and fundamental base to use:\n- A Delaunay triangulation (DT) of a planar point set is a triangulation such that the circumcircle of each triangle is empty of all other input points. The empty circumcircle property is fundamental: If a point lies inside the circumcircle of a triangle, flipping the triangle edge will increase the minimum angle of the local triangulation and restore Delaunay-ness.\n- The minimum angle of a triangle with vertices at points $\\mathbf{a}$, $\\mathbf{b}$, and $\\mathbf{c}$ is the smallest of its three interior angles. All angles must be handled in degrees.\n- A Steiner point is a point not in the original input that is inserted to improve mesh quality. A controlled Steiner point insertion rule should be applied to eliminate “skinny” triangles (triangles whose minimum angle is below a target bound $\\alpha$).\n\nYour program must implement the following specification:\n- Input model: For each test case, you are given a convex polygon $P$ specified by its vertices in counterclockwise order, and a target minimum angle bound $\\alpha$ in degrees. All coordinates are dimensionless. Angles must be treated in degrees.\n- Algorithmic requirement: Start with the vertices of $P$ as the initial point set. Repeatedly:\n  1. Compute the Delaunay triangulation of the current point set.\n  2. Identify any triangle whose minimum angle is less than the target bound $\\alpha$. If none exist, stop successfully.\n  3. For the worst (minimum-angle) triangle, compute its circumcenter and attempt to insert it as a Steiner point. If the circumcenter lies outside $P$, move it along the segment from the triangle centroid toward the circumcenter until it lies inside $P$ (binary search is acceptable). Insert the resulting point.\n  4. Continue until either all triangles meet the minimum angle bound $\\alpha$ or a maximum number of Steiner insertions is reached, in which case report failure for that test case.\n- Geometric and numerical constraints:\n  - All polygons in the test suite are convex. You must perform a point-in-convex-polygon test when projecting the circumcenter to ensure it lies inside $P$.\n  - If the triangle’s circumcenter computation is nearly singular (triangle almost collinear), you may fall back to inserting the triangle’s centroid.\n  - Use a small tolerance $\\varepsilon$ for floating-point comparisons where needed.\n  - Units: All angles must be computed in degrees and compared in degrees.\n\nTest suite:\nImplement the algorithm for the following test cases. Each test case is a pair $(P,\\alpha)$, where $P$ is a convex polygon and $\\alpha$ is the target minimum angle bound in degrees. The maximum number of Steiner insertions allowed per case is $200$.\n- Case A (happy path, square): $P = \\{(0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(0,1)\\}$, $\\alpha = 20$ degrees.\n- Case B (elongated rectangle): $P = \\{(0,0),(3,0),(3,1),(0,1)\\}$, $\\alpha = 20$ degrees.\n- Case C (skinny triangle, infeasible bound due to small input angle): $P = \\{(0,0),(1,0),(0.01,0.0001)\\}$, $\\alpha = 20$ degrees.\n- Case D (zero bound, trivially satisfiable): $P = \\{(0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(0,1)\\}$, $\\alpha = 0$ degrees.\n- Case E (overly ambitious bound on square): $P = \\{(0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(0,1)\\}$, $\\alpha = 35$ degrees.\n\nOutput specification:\n- For each test case, your program should compute a boolean indicating whether the algorithm successfully produced a Delaunay triangulation of the polygon $P$ whose every triangle has minimum angle at least $\\alpha$ degrees before exceeding the Steiner insertion cap.\n- Your program must produce a single line of output containing the results for Cases A through E, in order, as a comma-separated list of booleans enclosed in square brackets, like “[bA,bB,bC,bD,bE]”. No other output is permitted on any line.\n\nNotes on scientific realism and applicability:\n- The algorithm must be derived using the empty circumcircle property of Delaunay triangulations and the geometric relationship between circumradius-to-shortest-edge ratio and minimum angle in a triangle. Do not use any prepackaged mesh quality library. You may use a standard Delaunay triangulation routine.\n- The method must be universally applicable to any convex polygon input; the test suite focuses on representative “happy path,” elongated, infeasible, and boundary cases to probe different behaviors of the refinement process.\n\nAngle unit requirement: All angles must be computed and compared in degrees. There are no physical units in this problem. The final outputs are booleans only.", "solution": "The problem statement poses a valid and well-defined task in the field of computational engineering, specifically concerning mesh quality improvement. It is scientifically grounded, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique algorithmic implementation. The problem asks for the implementation of a 2D mesh refinement algorithm based on Delaunay triangulation for a convex polygonal domain. The goal is to enforce a minimum angle constraint on all triangles by iteratively inserting Steiner points.\n\nThe problem's validity is established as follows:\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The methodology is based on Ruppert's algorithm, a cornerstone of guaranteed-quality mesh generation. The core idea—that skinny triangles have large circumcircles and inserting the circumcenter is an effective way to improve angles—is a fundamental principle in this field. The relationship is captured by the formula $\\sin(\\alpha_{\\min}) = l_{\\min} / (2R)$, where $\\alpha_{\\min}$ is the triangle's minimum angle, $l_{\\min}$ is the length of its shortest edge, and $R$ is its circumradius. Minimizing the ratio $R/l_{\\min}$ is equivalent to maximizing $\\alpha_{\\min}$. Inserting the circumcenter directly targets and eliminates large empty circumcircles.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear, iterative algorithm with specific rules for point insertion and well-defined termination criteria (either the angle condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is exceeded). The inputs are precisely defined, and the expected output is unambiguous. The instruction to handle circumcenters outside the domain, while simplified compared to production-level algorithms, is algorithmically specified and implementable.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms, free from subjective or speculative content. The geometric constraints and numerical parameters are explicit.\n\nThe proposed solution implements the specified algorithm, adhering to the principles of Delaunay refinement. The process is iterative, beginning with the vertices of the input convex polygon $P$.\n\n**1. Algorithmic Procedure**\nAt each step of the iteration:\n1.  A Delaunay triangulation of the current set of points is computed using the `scipy.spatial.Delaunay` library function. As all inserted Steiner points are guaranteed to be within the convex domain $P$, the resulting triangulation correctly tiles $P$.\n2.  Each triangle in the triangulation is inspected. Its three interior angles are calculated. The triangle with the smallest minimum angle across the entire mesh is identified as the \"worst\" element.\n3.  If this global minimum angle is greater than or equal to the target angle bound $\\alpha$, the mesh is deemed of sufficient quality, the process terminates successfully.\n4.  If the minimum angle is less than $\\alpha$, a Steiner point is generated to refine the worst triangle. This point is then added to the set of points for the next iteration.\n5.  This loop continues until success is achieved or the maximum number of Steiner point insertions ($200$) is reached, which constitutes a failure.\n\n**2. Core Geometric Computations**\n\n**Angle Calculation:**\nFor a triangle with vertices $\\mathbf{a}$, $\\mathbf{b}$, and $\\mathbf{c}$, the angle at a vertex, for instance $\\mathbf{a}$, is computed using the dot product of the adjacent edge vectors, $\\vec{v}_{ab} = \\mathbf{b}-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\vec{v}_{ac} = \\mathbf{c}-\\mathbf{a}$. The angle $\\theta_a$ is given by:\n$$ \\theta_a = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\vec{v}_{ab} \\cdot \\vec{v}_{ac}}{\\|\\vec{v}_{ab}\\| \\|\\vec{v}_{ac}\\|}\\right) $$\nThis method is numerically more stable than the Law of Cosines for small angles. The result, obtained in radians, is converted to degrees for comparison with $\\alpha$.\n\n**Steiner Point Generation:**\n-   **Circumcenter:** The primary candidate for a Steiner point is the circumcenter of the worst triangle. For a triangle with vertices $(x_A, y_A)$, $(x_B, y_B)$, and $(x_C, y_C)$, the circumcenter $(O_x, O_y)$ is calculated using the intersection of perpendicular bisectors. The coordinates are given by:\n    $$ D = 2(x_A(y_B - y_C) + x_B(y_C - y_A) + x_C(y_A - y_B)) $$\n    $$ O_x = \\frac{1}{D}((x_A^2 + y_A^2)(y_B - y_C) + (x_B^2 + y_B^2)(y_C - y_A) + (x_C^2 + y_C^2)(y_A - y_B)) $$\n    $$ O_y = \\frac{1}{D}((x_A^2 + y_A^2)(x_C - x_B) + (x_B^2 + y_B^2)(x_A - x_C) + (x_C^2 + y_C^2)(x_B - x_A)) $$\n    The denominator $D$ is twice the signed area of the triangle. If $|D|$ is smaller than a tolerance $\\varepsilon = 10^{-9}$, the triangle is considered degenerate (nearly collinear), and we fallback to inserting the centroid.\n-   **Centroid:** The centroid $\\mathbf{g}$ of the triangle is the arithmetic mean of its vertex coordinates:\n    $$ \\mathbf{g} = \\frac{\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{c}}{3} $$\n\n**Domain Confinement:**\nA crucial step is to ensure that all Steiner points lie within the domain $P$. The centroid of any triangle whose vertices are in $P$ is guaranteed to be in $P$ because $P$ is convex. However, the circumcenter may lie outside $P$.\n-   **Point-in-Polygon Test:** To check if a point $\\mathbf{q}$ is inside the convex polygon $P$ (with vertices $\\mathbf{v}_0, \\mathbf{v}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{v}_{n-1}$ in counter-clockwise order), we verify that $\\mathbf{q}$ lies to the left of or on every directed edge $(\\mathbf{v}_i, \\mathbf{v}_{i+1})$. This is done by checking the sign of the 2D cross product:\n    $$ (\\mathbf{v}_{i+1} - \\mathbf{v}_i) \\times (\\mathbf{q} - \\mathbf{v}_i) \\ge 0 \\quad \\forall i \\in \\{0, \\dots, n-1\\} $$\n-   **Projection:** If the circumcenter $\\mathbf{c}_c$ is outside $P$, a new point must be found inside $P$. As per the problem statement, we search for this point on the line segment connecting the triangle's centroid $\\mathbf{g}$ (which is inside $P$) and $\\mathbf{c}_c$. We parameterize this segment as $\\mathbf{p}(t) = \\mathbf{g} + t(\\mathbf{c}_c - \\mathbf{g})$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$. We use binary search on the parameter $t$ to find the value closest to $1$ for which $\\mathbf{p}(t)$ is still inside $P$. This effectively projects the external point to a position just inside the polygon's boundary, satisfying the problem's instruction.\n\nThis comprehensive approach correctly implements the specified mesh refinement strategy, allowing for the evaluation of its performance on the provided test cases, which probe its behavior in standard, challenging, and infeasible scenarios.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.spatial import Delaunay\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run the mesh refinement algorithm on all test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Numerical tolerance for floating-point comparisons.\n    TOL = 1e-9\n    \n    def calculate_angles(p1, p2, p3):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the three interior angles of a triangle in degrees.\"\"\"\n        # Vectors representing the sides\n        v12, v13, v23 = p2 -
