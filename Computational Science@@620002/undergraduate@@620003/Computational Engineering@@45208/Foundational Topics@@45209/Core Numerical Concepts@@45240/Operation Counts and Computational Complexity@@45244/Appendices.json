A unique, meaningful solution can be derived.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms. Terminology such as \"un-ordered pairs,\" \"linear-time passes,\" and \"sequentially on a single computational thread\" is unambiguous.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a straightforward, well-defined exercise in algorithmic analysis. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $T_{dept}(N)$ denote the time taken to compute the risk metric for a single department with $N$ positions. According to the problem statement, this is bounded above by a polynomial in $N$, such that:\n$$T_{dept}(N) \\le a N^{2} + b N + c$$\nwhere $a > 0$, $b > 0$, and $c > 0$ are constants. This corresponds to a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(N^{2})$ for a single department.\n\nThe bank has $D$ such departments, and they are processed sequentially. The principle of sequential composition dictates that the total time for a sequence of operations is the sum of the times for each individual operation. As there is no reuse of computation across departments, the total time required to process all $D$ departments, which we will call $T_{all\\_depts}(N, D)$, is the sum of the costs for each of the $D$ identical computations.\n$$T_{all\\_depts}(N, D) = \\sum_{i=1}^{D} T_{dept}(N) = D \\cdot T_{dept}(N)$$\nTherefore, the upper bound for this phase of the computation is:\n$$D \\cdot (a N^{2} + b N + c)$$\n\nFollowing the departmental computations, an enterprise aggregation step is performed. Let the time for this aggregation be $T_{agg}(D)$. The problem states this is bounded above by a linear function of $D$:\n$$T_{agg}(D) \\le k D$$\nwhere $k > 0$ is a constant. This corresponds to a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(D)$.\n\nThe overall process consists of the computation for all departments followed by the final aggregation. Applying the principle of sequential composition again, the total time for the firm-wide risk calculation, $T_{total}(N, D)$, is the sum of the times for these two stages. The upper bound on the total time is:\n$$T_{total}(N, D) \\le T_{all\\_depts}(N, D) + T_{agg}(D)$$\n$$T_{total}(N, D) \\le D(a N^{2} + b N + c) + k D$$\nExpanding this expression gives:\n$$T_{total}(N, D) \\le a D N^{2} + b D N + c D + k D$$\n$$T_{total}(N, D) \\le a D N^{2} + b D N + (c+k)D$$\n\nTo determine the overall asymptotic time complexity, we must identify the dominant term in this polynomial expression for large values of $N$ and $D$. The terms are $a D N^{2}$, $b D N$, and $(c+k)D$. According to the definition of Big-Oh notation, we need to find constants $C > 0$, $N_{0} \\ge 1$, and $D_{0} \\ge 1$ such that for all $N \\ge N_{0}$ and $D \\ge D_{0}$, the following inequality holds:\n$$a D N^{2} + b D N + (c+k)D \\le C \\cdot g(N, D)$$\nwhere $g(N,D)$ is the simplest function that characterizes the growth rate.\n\nLet us choose $g(N, D) = D N^{2}$. We must demonstrate that $a D N^{2} + b D N + (c+k)D \\in \\mathcal{O}(D N^{2})$.\nGiven the problem constraints, $N \\ge 1$ and $D \\ge 1$.\nFor $N \\ge 1$, we have $N \\le N^{2}$, and thus $b D N \\le b D N^{2}$.\nSimilarly, for $N \\ge 1$, we have $1 \\le N^{2}$, which implies $D \\le D N^{2}$, and so $(c+k)D \\le (c+k)D N^{2}$.\n\nSubstituting these inequalities back into the expression for the total time:\n$$a D N^{2} + b D N + (c+k)D \\le a D N^{2} + b D N^{2} + (c+k)D N^{2}$$\n$$a D N^{2} + b D N + (c+k)D \\le (a + b + c + k) D N^{2}$$\nLet $C = a + b + c + k$. Since $a, b, c, k$ are all positive constants, $C$ is also a positive constant. The inequality holds for all $N \\ge 1$ and $D \\ge 1$.\nTherefore, by the formal definition of Big-Oh notation, the total time complexity is bounded above by $C \\cdot D N^{2}$.\n\nThe overall time complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(D N^{2})$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\mathcal{O}(D N^{2})}$$", "id": "2380831"}, {"introduction": "While asymptotic complexity is a powerful tool, it doesn't tell the whole story of performance.
