The request to use a momentum balance to balance surface tension and gravity is a fundamental and correct approach for this static fluid problem. All principles are well-established.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary parameters and a clear objective. The relationship between the given quantities and the desired result is deterministic, suggesting a unique solution exists.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative language. No subjective or ambiguous terms are present.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. All variables required for the derivation and calculation ($\\gamma, \\rho, g, r, \\theta$) are provided. The assumptions, such as static equilibrium and uniform atmospheric pressure, are consistent and simplify the problem appropriately for this level of analysis.\n5.  **Realism**: The numerical values given for the properties of water (density, surface tension) and for gravity are standard and physically accurate. The dimensions of the capillary tube and the contact angle are realistic.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. It is a valid problem in continuum mechanics. A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe integral form of the linear momentum balance for a control volume (CV) is given by the Reynolds transport theorem:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{CV} \\rho \\mathbf{v} \\, dV + \\int_{CS} \\rho \\mathbf{v} (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\, dA = \\sum \\mathbf{F}_{ext}\n$$\nFor a system in static equilibrium, the velocity field $\\mathbf{v}$ is identically zero. Consequently, the time derivative term and the surface integral term (convective flux of momentum) are both zero. The equation simplifies to a balance of external forces:\n$$\n\\sum \\mathbf{F}_{ext} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nWe define a cylindrical control volume that contains the column of liquid that has risen above the reservoir's free surface. The control volume is bounded by:\n-   A flat, circular bottom surface at the level of the reservoir ($z=0$), with area $A = \\pi r^2$.\n-   The wetted cylindrical wall of the tube from $z=0$ up to the contact line.\n-   The curved liquid-air interface (the meniscus) at the top.\n\nWe now analyze the external forces acting on this control volume in the vertical ($z$) direction.\n1.  **Gravitational Force ($F_g$)**: This is a body force acting downwards on the mass of the liquid within the control volume. The mass is $m = \\rho V$, where $V$ is the volume of the liquid. We approximate the volume of the liquid column by that of a perfect cylinder of radius $r$ and height $h$. This approximation is valid when the volume of the meniscus is negligible compared to the total volume of the column, which is true for sufficiently large aspect ratios $h/r$. The gravitational force is therefore:\n    $$\n    F_g = m g = (\\rho V) g \\approx \\rho (\\pi r^2 h) g\n    $$\n2.  **Pressure Forces ($F_p$)**:\n    -   At the bottom surface of the control volume ($z=0$), the pressure is the ambient atmospheric pressure, $P_{atm}$, since it is at the same elevation as the free surface of the large reservoir. This results in an upward force $F_{p, \\text{bottom}} = P_{atm} (\\pi r^2)$.\n    -   The problem states that the air pressure just above the meniscus is also atmospheric, $P_{atm}$. This pressure exerts a downward force on the top surface of the liquid. The projected area of the meniscus onto the horizontal plane is $\\pi r^2$. Thus, the downward force is $F_{p, \\text{top}} = P_{atm} (\\pi r^2)$.\n    -   The net force from the ambient pressure is therefore zero: $F_{p, \\text{net}} = F_{p, \\text{bottom}} - F_{p, \\text{top}} = 0$.\n\n3.  **Surface Tension Force ($F_{\\gamma}$)**: This force arises at the three-phase contact line (liquid-gas-solid) along the perimeter of the tube. The surface tension, $\\gamma$, is a force per unit length. The total length of the contact line is the circumference of the tube, $L = 2\\pi r$. The force acts along the tangent to the liquid surface at the contact angle $\\theta$ with respect to the vertical tube wall. The vertical component of this force, which pulls the liquid column upward, is:\n    $$\n    F_{\\gamma, z} = (2\\pi r) \\gamma \\cos\\theta\n    $$\nApplying the static equilibrium condition $\\sum F_z = 0$:\n$$\nF_{\\gamma, z} - F_g = 0\n$$\n$$\n2\\pi r \\gamma \\cos\\theta - \\rho g \\pi r^2 h = 0\n$$\nWe can now solve for the equilibrium height $h$. The term $\\pi r$ can be cancelled from both sides of the equation:\n$$\n2 \\gamma \\cos\\theta - \\rho g r h = 0\n$$\nIsolating $h$, we obtain the expression for the capillary rise, known as Jurin's Law:\n$$\nh = \\frac{2 \\gamma \\cos\\theta}{\\rho g r}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation from first principles.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the provided data. First, all units must be converted to the base SI system.\n-   $\\gamma = 0.0720 \\ \\mathrm{N/m}$\n-   $\\rho = 997 \\ \\mathrm{kg/m^3}$\n-   $g = 9.81 \\ \\mathrm{m/s^2}$\n-   $r = 0.30 \\ \\mathrm{mm} = 0.30 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n-   $\\theta = 35^{\\circ}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$\nh = \\frac{2 \\times (0.0720) \\times \\cos(35^{\\circ})}{(997) \\times (9.81) \\times (0.30 \\times 10^{-3})}\n$$\nCalculation of the numerator and denominator:\n-   Numerator: $2 \\times 0.0720 \\times \\cos(35^{\\circ}) \\approx 2 \\times 0.0720 \\times 0.819152 = 0.117958$\n-   Denominator: $997 \\times 9.81 \\times 0.30 \\times 10^{-3} \\approx 9780.57 \\times 0.30 \\times 10^{-3} = 2.93417$\n$$\nh \\approx \\frac{0.117958}{2.93417} \\approx 0.040201 \\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in millimeters (mm) rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nh \\approx 0.040201 \\ \\mathrm{m} \\times \\frac{1000 \\ \\mathrm{mm}}{1 \\ \\mathrm{m}} = 40.201 \\ \\mathrm{mm}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $40.2 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{40.2}$$", "id": "2381292"}, {"introduction": "Moving from statics to dynamics, this practice explores the vibrational behavior of a nonlinear system, modeled after a spider's web.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all provided data are consistent and sufficient for a unique solution. I will therefore proceed to solve it.\n\nThe primary task is to determine the smallest strictly positive angular natural frequency, $\\omega_{\\min}$, for a point mass connected to fixed anchors by nonlinear elastic strands. The analysis is performed by linearizing the equations of motion about a given static equilibrium position, which is assumed to be $\\mathbf{x}^\\star = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nThe governing equation for small-amplitude free vibrations is given as:\n$$\nm\\, \\delta \\ddot{\\mathbf{x}} + \\mathbf{K}\\, \\delta \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nwhere $m$ is the mass, $\\delta\\mathbf{x}$ is the small displacement vector from equilibrium, and $\\mathbf{K}$ is the $2 \\times 2$ tangent stiffness matrix.

Our goal is to compute $\\mathbf{K}$, find its eigenvalues, and then determine the smallest resulting positive frequency.\n\nThe total tangent stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ is the sum of contributions from each strand, $\\mathbf{K} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbf{K}_i$. A strand $i$ contributes to the stiffness only if it is in tension at the equilibrium position, i.e., if its current length $L_i = \\|\\mathbf{x}^\\star - \\mathbf{a}_i\\|$ is greater than its reference length $L_{0i}$. The extension is $\\Delta L_i = L_i - L_{0i}$.

This exercise provides invaluable insight into how material memory is encoded using internal state variables, a fundamental concept in advanced simulations of engineering materials.", "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional small-strain bar made of an elastoplastic metal, modeled as a rate-independent material with kinematic hardening to capture the Bauschinger effect. Assume quasi-static conditions so that inertia and body forces are negligible, and the stress field is spatially uniform. The strain history is prescribed, and the Cauchy stress is determined by the constitutive model.\n\nStarting from the following fundamental base:\n- Kinematics of small strain: $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_e + \\epsilon_p$, where $\\epsilon$ is the total strain, $\\epsilon_e$ is the elastic strain, and $\\epsilon_p$ is the plastic strain.\n- Linear elasticity: $\\sigma = E\\,\\epsilon_e = E\\,(\\epsilon - \\epsilon_p)$, where $\\sigma$ is the Cauchy stress and $E$ is the Young's modulus.\n- Associative plasticity with a kinematic hardening backstress $a$: yield function $f = \\lvert \\sigma - a \\rvert - \\sigma_y \\le 0$ with initial yield stress $\\sigma_y > 0$.\n- Flow rule and hardening law: $d\\epsilon_p = d\\lambda\\,\\partial f/\\partial \\sigma$, $da = H_k\\,d\\epsilon_p$, where $H_k \\ge 0$ is the kinematic hardening modulus, $d\\lambda \\ge 0$ is the plastic multiplier, the consistency conditions $f \\le 0$, $d\\lambda \\ge 0$, and $d\\lambda\\,f = 0$ hold, and the sign of $\\partial f/\\partial \\sigma$ is induced by $\\mathrm{sign}(\\sigma - a)$.\n- At the onset of plasticity in monotonic tension, the elastic limit strain is $\\epsilon_y = \\sigma_y/E$.\n\nA single load path is to be applied to the bar for each test case:\n1. Monotonic straining in tension from $\\epsilon = 0$ to $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_{\\max}$.\n2. Immediate unloading in the reverse (compressive) direction, assumed initially elastic, until reverse plastic yielding begins.\n\nDefine the reverse-yield stress $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ as the value of the Cauchy stress at the moment when plastic loading re-initiates in the reverse direction during unloading, that is, at the first instant on unloading when the yield condition is attained with $(\\sigma - a) < 0$. During elastic unloading, the plastic strain and backstress remain fixed until yielding resumes.\n\nYour task is to implement a robust algorithm consistent with the above principles (for example, via an elastic trial state and a return-mapping correction under the consistency condition) to compute $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ for each of the following test cases. All input parameters are physically realistic and given in the International System of Units (SI). The final answers must be expressed in pascals (Pa) as real numbers.\n\nTest suite (material parameters and prescribed maximum strain):\n- Case $1$: $E = 2.10 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\text{Pa}$, $\\sigma_y = 2.50 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\text{Pa}$, $H_k = 0\\,\\text{Pa}$, $\\epsilon_{\\max} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n- Case $2$: $E = 2.10 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\text{Pa}$, $\\sigma_y = 2.50 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\text{Pa}$, $H_k = 5.0 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\text{Pa}$, $\\epsilon_{\\max} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n- Case $3$: $E = 2.10 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\text{Pa}$, $\\sigma_y = 2.50 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\text{Pa}$, $H_k = 5.0 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\text{Pa}$, $\\epsilon_{\\max} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}$.\n- Case $4$: $E = 2.10 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\text{Pa}$, $\\sigma_y = 2.50 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\text{Pa}$, $H_k = 1.0 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\text{Pa}$, $\\epsilon_{\\max} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n\nRequirements:\n- Begin from the stated kinematics, elasticity, yield function, associative flow rule, and hardening law. Do not assume any additional phenomenological shortcut formulas not derivable from these bases.\n- Implement a computationally sound algorithm that enforces the consistency condition during plastic loading and correctly distinguishes between elastic and plastic steps.

It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of continuum damage mechanics, specifically rate-independent elastoplasticity with linear kinematic hardening. It is well-posed, objective, and provides all necessary information to derive a unique solution. The parameters are physically realistic for a metallic material. We will proceed with a rigorous derivation of the solution from the provided fundamental equations.\n\nThe task is to determine the reverse-yield stress, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{rev}}$, for a one-dimensional bar subjected to a tension-then-compression strain path. The material model is defined by the following equations:\n1.  Additive strain decomposition: $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_e + \\epsilon_p$\n2.  Linear elasticity (Hooke's law): $\\sigma = E(\\epsilon - \\epsilon_p)$\n3.  Yield condition: $f = |\\sigma - a| - \\sigma_y \\le 0$\n4.  Flow rule: $d\\epsilon_p = d\\lambda \\, \\mathrm{sign}(\\sigma - a)$\n5.  Kinematic hardening law: $da = H_k \\, d\\epsilon_p$\n\nHere, $\\epsilon$ is total strain, $\\epsilon_e$ is elastic strain, $\\epsilon_p$ is plastic strain, $\\sigma$ is Cauchy stress, $a$ is backstress, $E$ is Young's modulus, $\\sigma_y$ is the initial yield stress, $H_k$ is the kinematic hardening modulus, and $d\\lambda \\ge 0$ is the plastic multiplier satisfying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. The material is initially in a virgin state at $\\epsilon=0$, meaning $\\sigma=0$, $\\epsilon_p=0$, and $a=0$.\n\nThe solution is developed in two stages corresponding to the prescribed load path.\n\n**Stage 1: Monotonic Tensile Loading**\n\nThe bar is strained from $\\epsilon = 0$ to $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_{\\max}$.\nInitially, the response is elastic. Plastic strain and backstress are zero ($\\epsilon_p = 0$, $a=0$). The stress is given by $\\sigma = E\\epsilon$. The yield function is $f = |\\sigma| - \\sigma_y = E\\epsilon - \\sigma_y$ for tensile loading ($\\epsilon > 0$).\n\nYielding commences when $f=0$, which occurs at the yield strain $\\epsilon_y = \\sigma_y/E$. The nature of the loading path depends on the comparison between $\\epsilon_{\\max}$ and $\\epsilon_y$.\n\nCase 1.1: Purely Elastic Loading ($\\epsilon_{\\max} \\le \\epsilon_y$)\nIf the maximum applied strain does not exceed the yield strain, no plastic deformation occurs. At the point of load reversal, $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_{\\max}$, the state variables are:\n- Plastic strain: $\\epsilon_{p, \\max} = 0$\n- Backstress: $a_{\\max} = 0$\n- Stress: $\\sigma_{\\max} = E\\epsilon_{\\max}$\n\nCase 1.2: Elastoplastic Loading ($\\epsilon_{\\max} > \\epsilon_y$)\nWhen $\\epsilon > \\epsilon_y$, the material yields and deforms plastically. During plastic flow in tension, the consistency condition $f=0$ must be maintained. For $\\sigma - a > 0$, this implies $\\sigma - a = \\sigma_y$. In rate form, this is $df = d\\sigma - da = 0$, so $d\\sigma = da$.\n\nThe increments of plastic strain and backstress are related by the hardening law: $da = H_k d\\epsilon_p$.\nThe stress increment is given by the elastic law: $d\\sigma = E(d\\epsilon - d\\epsilon_p)$.\n\nCombining these relations, we solve for the plastic strain increment $d\\epsilon_p$:\n$d\\sigma = da \\implies E(d\\epsilon - d\\epsilon_p) = H_k d\\epsilon_p$\n$E d\\epsilon = (E + H_k) d\\epsilon_p$\n$d\\epsilon_p = \\frac{E}{E+H_k} d\\epsilon$\n\nThe total plastic strain accumulated from the onset of yield ($\\epsilon = \\epsilon_y$) to the maximum strain ($\\epsilon = \\epsilon_{\\max}$) is found by integration:\n$$ \\epsilon_{p, \\max} = \\int_{\\epsilon_y}^{\\epsilon_{\\max}} \\frac{E}{E+H_k} d\\epsilon = \\frac{E}{E+H_k} (\\epsilon_{\\max} - \\epsilon_y) $$\nThe backstress at maximum strain is then obtained by integrating the hardening law:\n$$ a_{\\max} = \\int_{0}^{\\epsilon_{p, \\max}} H_k d\\epsilon_p = H_k \\epsilon_{p, \\max} = H_k \\frac{E}{E+H_k} (\\epsilon_{\\max} - \\epsilon_y) $$\nwhere $\\epsilon_y = \\sigma_y/E$. The stress at $\\epsilon_{\\max}$ is $\\sigma_{\\max} = a_{\\max} + \\sigma_y$.\n\n**Stage 2: Elastic Unloading and Reverse Yield**\n\nUnloading begins from the state $(\\sigma_{\\max}, \\epsilon_{p, \\max}, a_{\\max})$ at $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_{\\max}$. The strain $\\epsilon$ is decreased. The unloading is initially elastic, meaning the internal state variables remain fixed: $\\epsilon_p = \\epsilon_{p, \\max}$ and $a = a_{\\max}$.\n\nThe stress during elastic unloading is given by:\n$\\sigma = E(\\epsilon - \\epsilon_{p, \\max})$\nThe change in stress is $\\Delta\\sigma = \\sigma - \\sigma_{\\max} = E(\\epsilon - \\epsilon_{\\max})$.\n\nReverse yielding occurs when the yield condition $f=0$ is met again. As stress decreases, $\\sigma$ becomes less than $a_{\\max}$, so the term $\\sigma - a_{\\max}$ becomes negative. The yield function is therefore $f = -(\\sigma - a_{\\max}) - \\sigma_y$. Reverse yield occurs at the stress $\\sigma = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ for which $f=0$:\n$$ -(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{rev}} - a_{\\max}) - \\sigma_y = 0 $$\nSolving for the reverse-yield stress gives:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{rev}} = a_{\\max} - \\sigma_y $$\nThis equation is general. The value of $a_{\\max}$ is determined from Stage 1.\n\n**Summary of the Algorithm**\n\nFor a given set of parameters $\\{E, \\sigma_y, H_k, \\epsilon_{\\max}\\}$:\n1.  Calculate the yield strain: $\\epsilon_y = \\sigma_y / E$.\n2.  Determine the backstress at maximum tensile strain, $a_{\\max}$:\n    - If $\\epsilon_{\\max} \\le \\epsilon_y$ (elastic loading), then $a_{\\max} = 0$.\n    - If $\\epsilon_{\\max} > \\epsilon_y$ (elastoplastic loading), then $a_{\\max} = H_k \\frac{E}{E + H_k} (\\epsilon_{\\max} - \\frac{\\sigma_y}{E})$.\n3.  Calculate the reverse-yield stress using the value of $a_{\\max}$:\n    - $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{rev}} = a_{\\max} - \\sigma_y$.\n\nThis algorithm correctly accounts for the Bauschinger effect through the evolution of the backstress $a$ and handles the special cases of purely elastic loading and perfect plasticity ($H_k=0$).
