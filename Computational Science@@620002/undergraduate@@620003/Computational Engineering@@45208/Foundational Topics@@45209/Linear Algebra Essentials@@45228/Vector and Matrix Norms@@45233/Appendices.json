These are fundamental tools in computational engineering.\n- **Well-Posed:** The matrix $G$ is unambiguously defined for any valid $n$, $p$, $q$, and $\\theta$. The matrix norms are standard mathematical functions with unique outputs for any given matrix. The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise mathematical language, free from subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. It is therefore deemed **valid**. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe Givens rotation matrix $G$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix that is identical to the identity matrix $I_n$ except for four entries. The entries of $G$, denoted by $g_{ij}$, are:\n$g_{pp} = \\cos\\theta$\n$g_{qq} = \\cos\\theta$\n$g_{pq} = \\sin\\theta$\n$g_{qp} = -\\sin\\theta$\n$g_{ii} = 1$ for $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\} \\setminus \\{p, q\\}$\n$g_{ij} = 0$ for all other pairs $(i, j)$ with $i \\ne j$.\n\nWe will now compute the required norms based on their fundamental definitions.\n\n**1. The Matrix $1$-Norm ($\\|G\\|_{1}$)**\nThe matrix $1$-norm, or column-sum norm, is defined as the maximum absolute column sum:\n$$ \\|G\\|_{1} = \\max_{1 \\le j \\le n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |g_{ij}| $$\nWe examine the columns of $G$:\n- For any column $j$ such that $j \\ne p$ and $j \\ne q$, the only non-zero entry is $g_{jj} = 1$. The sum of absolute values for such a column is $|1| = 1$.\n- For column $p$, the non-zero entries are $g_{pp} = \\cos\\theta$ and $g_{qp} = -\\sin\\theta$. The sum is $|g_{pp}| + |g_{qp}| = |\\cos\\theta| + |-\\sin\\theta| = |\\cos\\theta| + |\\sin\\theta|$.\n- For column $q$, the non-zero entries are $g_{pq} = \\sin\\theta$ and $g_{qq} = \\cos\\theta$. The sum is $|g_{pq}| + |g_{qq}| = |\\sin\\theta| + |\\cos\\theta|$.\n\nThe $1$-norm is the maximum of these sums:\n$$ \\|G\\|_{1} = \\max(1, |\\cos\\theta| + |\\sin\\theta|) $$\nWe know that for any real $\\theta$, $|\\cos\\theta| + |\\sin\\theta| \\ge \\sqrt{\\cos^2\\theta + \\sin^2\\theta} = 1$. The equality holds when $\\theta$ is an integer multiple of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Therefore, the maximum is always $|\\cos\\theta| + |\\sin\\theta|$.\n$$ \\|G\\|_{1} = |\\cos\\theta| + |\\sin\\theta| $$\n\n**2. The Matrix $\\infty$-Norm ($\\|G\\|_{\\infty}$)**\nThe matrix $\\infty$-norm, or row-sum norm, is defined as the maximum absolute row sum:\n$$ \\|G\\|_{\\infty} = \\max_{1 \\le i \\le n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} |g_{ij}| $$\nWe examine the rows of $G$:\n- For any row $i$ such that $i \\ne p$ and $i \\ne q$, the only non-zero entry is $g_{ii} = 1$. The sum of absolute values for such a row is $|1| = 1$.\n- For row $p$, the non-zero entries are $g_{pp} = \\cos\\theta$ and $g_{pq} = \\sin\\theta$. The sum is $|g_{pp}| + |g_{pq}| = |\\cos\\theta| + |\\sin\\theta|$.\n- For row $q$, the non-zero entries are $g_{qp} = -\\sin\\theta$ and $g_{qq} = \\cos\\theta$. The sum is $|g_{qp}| + |g_{qq}| = |-\\sin\\theta| + |\\cos\\theta| = |\\sin\\theta| + |\\cos\\theta|$.\n\nBy the same logic as for the $1$-norm, the maximum of these sums is:\n$$ \\|G\\|_{\\infty} = |\\cos\\theta| + |\\sin\\theta| $$\n\n**3. The Matrix $2$-Norm ($\\|G\\|_{2}$)**\nThe matrix $2$-norm, or spectral norm, is defined as the square root of the largest eigenvalue of the matrix $G^T G$:\n$$ \\|G\\|_{2} = \\sqrt{\\lambda_{\\max}(G^T G)} $$\nThe matrix $G$ is an orthogonal matrix. We verify this by computing $G^T G$. The transpose $G^T$ is identical to $G$ except that the roles of $g_{pq}$ and $g_{qp}$ are swapped. Thus, $g_{pq}^T = g_{qp} = -\\sin\\theta$ and $g_{qp}^T = g_{pq} = \\sin\\theta$.\nThe product $G^T G$ will be an identity matrix. To see this, consider the submatrix action. The $2 \\times 2$ submatrix of $G$ is $R(\\theta) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ -\\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$. Its transpose is $R(\\theta)^T = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe product is:\n$$ R(\\theta)^T R(\\theta) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos^2\\theta + \\sin^2\\theta & \\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta - \\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta - \\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta & \\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSince all other rows and columns of $G$ are standard basis vectors, the full matrix product $G^T G$ results in the $n \\times n$ identity matrix, $I_n$.\nThe eigenvalues of $I_n$ are all equal to $1$. Thus, $\\lambda_{\\max}(G^T G) = 1$.\nThe $2$-norm is therefore:\n$$ \\|G\\|_{2} = \\sqrt{1} = 1 $$\n\n**4. The Frobenius Norm ($\\|G\\|_{F}$)**\nThe Frobenius norm is defined as the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of all entries:\n$$ \\|G\\|_{F} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} |g_{ij}|^2} $$\nWe sum the squares of all non-zero entries of $G$:\n- $(n-2)$ entries are equal to $1$ (the diagonal entries for indices other than $p$ and $q$). Their contribution to the sum of squares is $(n-2) \\times 1^2 = n-2$.\n- The four entries in the $\\{p,q\\}$ sub-block are $\\cos\\theta$, $\\sin\\theta$, $-\\sin\\theta$, and $\\cos\\theta$. Their contribution to the sum of squares is $(\\cos\\theta)^2 + (\\sin\\theta)^2 + (-\\sin\\theta)^2 + (\\cos\\theta)^2 = 2\\cos^2\\theta + 2\\sin^2\\theta = 2(\\cos^2\\theta + \\sin^2\\theta) = 2$.\n\nThe total sum of squares is $(n-2) + 2 = n$.\nThe Frobenius norm is therefore:\n$$ \\|G\\|_{F} = \\sqrt{n} $$\n\n**Interpretation of Results**\nThe problem asks for an interpretation in terms of length preservation and norm dependence.\n- **Length Preservation:** The result $\\|G\\|_{2} = 1$ is the mathematical statement of the geometric property that Givens rotations are isometries in Euclidean space. The $2$-norm of a matrix measures the maximum factor by which it can stretch a vector's Euclidean length ($\\|x\\|_2$). A value of $1$ signifies that no vector's length is changed, i.e., $\\|Gx\\|_{2} = \\|x\\|_{2}$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. This is precisely what is meant by \"preserving Euclidean lengths\".\n- **Norm Dependence:** The results demonstrate that the \"size\" of the matrix $G$ depends on the chosen norm. While it is a pure rotation of size $1$ in the Euclidean sense ($\\|G\\|_2=1$), its $1$-norm and $\\infty$-norm, $\\|G\\|_{1} = \\|G\\|_{\\infty} = |\\cos\\theta| + |\\sin\\theta|$, depend on the rotation angle $\\theta$ and can be as large as $\\sqrt{2}$. This shows that a transformation that is a pure rotation for the Euclidean norm can act as an amplification for vectors measured in other norms (e.g., the $1$-norm or $\\infty$-norm). The Frobenius norm, $\\|G\\|_{F}=\\sqrt{n}$, depends only on the dimension $n$ of the space, not the angle $\\theta$. This is because a rotation merely redistributes the matrix elements' squared magnitudes within the active sub-block, leaving their sum invariant, while the norm counts all entries, including the $n-2$ invariant unit entries on the diagonal. The different results for different norms highlight that there is no single, universal measure for the \"size\" of a linear transformation; the measure is dependent on the metric used.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} |\\cos\\theta| + |\\sin\\theta| & 1 & |\\cos\\theta| + |\\sin\\theta| & \\sqrt{n} \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "2449542"}, {"introduction": "While all matrix norms on a finite-dimensional space are mathematically equivalent, this can be a misleading statement in computational practice.

This is equivalent to minimizing the squared Euclidean distance, $f(x) = \\|x - y\\|_2^2$, which is analytically more convenient due to its differentiability. The optimization problem is thus:\n$$ \\text{Minimize} \\quad f(x) = (x_1 - 2)^2 + (x_2 - 2)^2 + (x_3 - 2)^2 $$\n$$ \\text{Subject to} \\quad |x_1| + |x_2| + |x_3| \\le 1 $$\n\nFirst, we analyze the properties of the optimal solution $x^{\\star} = (x_1^{\\star}, x_2^{\\star}, x_3^{\\star})$. Let us assume, for the sake of contradiction, that one component of the solution is negative, for instance, $x_k^{\\star} < 0$ for some $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. Consider a new point $\\tilde{x}$ defined by its components $\\tilde{x}_i = x_i^{\\star}$ for $i \\neq k$ and $\\tilde{x}_k = -x_k^{\\star} > 0$. The $L_1$ norm of $\\tilde{x}$ is $\\|\\tilde{x}\\|_1 = \\sum_{i \\neq k} |x_i^{\\star}| + |-x_k^{\\star}| = \\|x^{\\star}\\|_1 \\le 1$, so $\\tilde{x}$ is also an element of the feasible set $B_1$.\nNow, we compare the values of the objective function for $x^{\\star}$ and $\\tilde{x}$. The difference is:\n$$ f(x^{\\star}) - f(\\tilde{x}) = \\|x^{\\star}-y\\|_2^2 - \\|\\tilde{x}-y\\|_2^2 = (x_k^{\\star} - 2)^2 - (\\tilde{x}_k - 2)^2 $$\nSince $y_k=2 > 0$ and $x_k^{\\star} < 0$, let $a = -x_k^{\\star} > 0$. The expression becomes:\n$$ (-a - 2)^2 - (a - 2)^2 = (a+2)^2 - (a-2)^2 = (a^2 + 4a + 4) - (a^2 - 4a + 4) = 8a $$\nBecause $a>0$, this difference $8a$ is strictly positive. This implies $f(x^{\\star}) > f(\\tilde{x})$, which contradicts the assumption that $x^{\\star}$ is the minimum. Therefore, no component of the solution can be negative. We must have $x_i^{\\star} \\ge 0$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nWith the knowledge that $x_i \\ge 0$, the constraint $|x_1| + |x_2| + |x_3| \\le 1$ simplifies to $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 \\le 1$.\nThe unconstrained minimum of $f(x)$ occurs at the point where its gradient is zero: $\\nabla f(x) = (2(x_1-2), 2(x_2-2), 2(x_3-2)) = (0, 0, 0)$, which yields the solution $x = (2, 2, 2)$. This point is the same as $y$. We check if this point is in the feasible set $B_1$: $\\|(2, 2, 2)\\|_1 = 2+2+2 = 6$, which is greater than $1$. So, the unconstrained minimum lies outside the feasible region. Because $f(x)$ is a convex function and $B_1$ is a convex set, the constrained minimum must lie on the boundary of $B_1$. The boundary is defined by $\\|x\\|_1 = 1$.\nGiven $x_i \\ge 0$, the boundary condition becomes $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 1$.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to minimizing $f(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ subject to the equality constraint $g(x_1, x_2, x_3) = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 - 1 = 0$ and non-negativity constraints $x_i \\ge 0$.
