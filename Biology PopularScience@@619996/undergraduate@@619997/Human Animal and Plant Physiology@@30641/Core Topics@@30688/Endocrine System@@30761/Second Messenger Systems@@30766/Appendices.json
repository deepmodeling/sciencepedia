The target cell type uses a pathway where a hormone binds to a surface receptor, leading to the activation of a fixed number of adenylyl cyclase (AC) enzyme molecules. This activation state persists for a characteristic duration, $\\tau_{act}$. During this time, each active AC molecule synthesizes cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) at a constant rate, $k_{syn}$.

This leads to the activation of Protein Kinase A (PKA). One of the downstream effects of PKA is the phosphorylation and activation of a key metabolic control enzyme, which we will call enzyme $E$. The termination of this signal is primarily handled by Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1), which dephosphorylates enzyme $E$.\n\nThe activity of PP1 is itself regulated by an inhibitor protein, Inhibitor-1 (I-1). When phosphorylated by PKA, I-1 becomes a potent inhibitor of PP1.\n\nConsider two populations of hepatocytes: a wild-type (WT) population and a mutant (MUT) population that has a loss-of-function mutation in the gene for I-1, resulting in no functional I-1 protein. Both cell types are stimulated with a constant high level of a glucagon analog, allowing them to reach a steady-state concentration of phosphorylated enzyme $E_p$.\n\nThe kinetics of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of enzyme $E$ can be modeled as follows:\n- The phosphorylation rate of $E$ by PKA is proportional to the concentration of the dephosphorylated form, $[E_{dp}]$, with a first-order rate constant $k_p$.\n- The dephosphorylation rate of $E_p$ by PP1 is proportional to $[E_p]$, with a first-order rate constant $k_d$. The value of $k_d$ depends on the activity of PP1.\n\nIn the MUT cells, where I-1 is absent, the dephosphorylation rate constant is maximal, denoted as $k_{d,max}$. In WT cells under high stimulation, the PKA-dependent inhibition of PP1 by I-1 reduces the dephosphorylation rate constant to $k_{d,WT} = \\frac{1}{6} k_{d,max}$.

Under these conditions, the cell reaches a steady-state concentration of cAMP.\n\nWe will analyze this signaling system under two distinct metabolic states: normoxia (normal oxygen levels) and severe hypoxia (critically low oxygen levels). The hypoxic state induces a metabolic crisis that alters the signaling landscape. Specifically, it lowers the intracellular ATP concentration and activates the cell's master energy sensor, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).
