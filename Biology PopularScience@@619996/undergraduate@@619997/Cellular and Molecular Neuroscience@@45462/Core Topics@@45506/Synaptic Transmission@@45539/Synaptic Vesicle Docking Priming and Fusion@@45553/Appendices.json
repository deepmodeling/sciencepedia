The SNARE proteins that drive vesicle fusion are a prime example; after performing their duty, they must be reset for the next round of release. This practice [@problem_id:2351938] presents a thought experiment involving a neurotoxin that freezes the SNARE complex post-fusion. By predicting the consequences, you will explore the critical importance of the SNARE disassembly step, which is just as vital as the initial assembly for maintaining synaptic transmission.", "problem": "In the process of chemical neurotransmission, the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane is mediated by the formation of a stable four-helix bundle known as the trans-SNARE complex. This complex consists of vesicle-associated SNAREs (v-SNAREs) and target-membrane-associated SNAREs (t-SNAREs). After a vesicle fuses and releases its neurotransmitter content, these SNARE proteins remain intertwined in the presynaptic membrane as a highly stable cis-SNARE complex. The disassembly of this complex is an energy-dependent process, crucial for recycling the SNARE proteins for subsequent rounds of fusion. This disassembly is carried out by an ATPase called N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) and its cofactor, Soluble NSF Attachment Protein (SNAP).\n\nImagine the discovery of a novel neurotoxin, Stasine, which has a unique mechanism of action: it binds irreversibly to the cis-SNARE complex immediately after vesicle fusion, rendering the complex completely resistant to the dissociating action of NSF and SNAP.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the ultimate consequence of continuous Stasine exposure on a repeatedly stimulated, otherwise healthy synapse?\n\nA. A massive, sustained potentiation of neurotransmitter release, as the fused vesicles are permanently anchored to the membrane.\n\nB. An initial burst of release followed by a complete cessation of synaptic transmission due to the depletion of free v-SNAREs and t-SNAREs required for priming new vesicles.\n\nC. A selective failure of endocytosis, leading to a massive expansion of the presynaptic membrane area and loss of synaptic structure.\n\nD. A failure of calcium channels to open in response to an action potential, as they become physically blocked by the stabilized SNARE complexes.\n\nE. The rate of neurotransmission remains unaffected, as the cell can rapidly synthesize new SNARE proteins to compensate for those that are locked in complexes.", "solution": "In normal synaptic transmission, vesicle fusion is driven by the formation of a trans-SNARE complex between v-SNAREs on synaptic vesicles and t-SNAREs on the presynaptic membrane, which zipper into a stable four-helix bundle to catalyze membrane fusion. After fusion, all SNAREs reside in the same membrane as a tightly intertwined cis-SNARE complex, which is physiologically inert for further fusion. To recycle these SNAREs for new rounds of exocytosis, NSF, with SNAP as a cofactor, uses ATP hydrolysis to disassemble the cis-SNARE complex into free v-SNAREs and t-SNAREs that can be resorted and re-primed.\n\nStasine irreversibly binds the cis-SNARE complex immediately after fusion and renders it refractory to NSF/SNAP-mediated disassembly. Consequently, each fusion event sequesters one set of v- and t-SNAREs into an inactive, locked cis-complex that cannot be returned to the pool of free, functional SNAREs. With repeated stimulation, the readily releasable pool initially discharges because already primed vesicles can still fuse, but no effective recycling of SNAREs occurs afterward. As more vesicles fuse under continued activity, the pool of free v- and t-SNAREs progressively declines, preventing formation of new trans-SNARE complexes and thereby blocking docking, priming, and subsequent exocytosis.\n\nThis predicts an initial burst of neurotransmitter release followed by failure of transmission due to depletion of the free SNAREs required for priming and fusion. The alternative options are inconsistent with the mechanism: there is no sustained potentiation because fusion is a one-time release event and locked cis-complexes are inert; endocytosis per se is not selectively blocked by SNARE disassembly failure, although proper SNARE recycling for exocytosis is; calcium channel opening is governed by voltage gating and is not physically occluded by membrane-embedded cis-SNAREs; and de novo synthesis cannot acutely compensate, especially since newly synthesized SNAREs would also be trapped upon first use under continuous Stasine exposure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2351938"}, {"introduction": "For vesicle fusion to occur, the SNARE complex must physically bridge the vesicle and the presynaptic membranes, acting like a molecular winch.

This fusion process is driven by the assembly of a highly stable protein complex known as the Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment protein REceptor (SNARE) complex. The core of this complex is formed by three proteins: the vesicle-SNARE (v-SNARE) synaptobrevin, which is embedded in the vesicle membrane, and the target-SNAREs (t-SNAREs) syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25, which are located on the presynaptic plasma membrane. The \"zippering\" of these proteins into a four-helix bundle pulls the two membranes together, culminating in fusion.\n\nConsider a hypothetical experiment where a neuron is genetically engineered to express a high cytoplasmic concentration of a soluble protein fragment, let's call it $S_{frag}$.

A complete block of the initial docking of synaptic vesicles to the presynaptic membrane, preventing them from reaching the active zone.\n\nE. A selective inhibition of spontaneous, action-potential-independent neurotransmitter release, with no effect on action-potential-evoked release.", "solution": "1) Mechanistic baseline: In a normal synapse, fusion requires assembly of a trans-SNARE complex in which the vesicular R-SNARE (synaptobrevin, denoted $V$) and the plasma membrane Q-SNAREs (syntaxin-1/SNAP-25, collectively denoted $T$) zipper into a four-helix bundle bridging the vesicle and plasma membranes. This trans-complex formation can be written as\n$$\nV + T \\rightleftharpoons V\\!:\\!T,\n$$\nwith a dissociation constant $K_{d,V} = \\frac{[V][T]}{[V\\!:\\!T]}$. Formation of $V\\!:\\!T$ is a prerequisite for Ca^{2+}-triggered fusion; thus, the number of vesicles that fuse per action potential scales with the number of functional $V\\!:\\!T$ trans-complexes assembled at primed release sites.\n\n2) Introduction of the soluble decoy: The engineered fragment $S_{\\text{frag}}$ is the soluble SNARE motif of synaptobrevin (denote $S$) lacking a transmembrane anchor. It can bind $T$ to form a complex\n$$\nS + T \\rightleftharpoons S\\!:\\!T,\n$$\nwith dissociation constant $K_{d,S} = \\frac{[S][T]}{[S\\!:\\!T]}$. Because $S$ contains the same SNARE motif as $V$, $K_{d,S}$ is of the same order as $K_{d,V}$ for the core bundle. However, $S\\!:\\!T$ does not bridge a vesicle membrane and thus cannot drive membrane apposition or fusion; it is a nonproductive complex.\n\n3) Competition and mass-action constraints: The available t-SNARE pool at the active zone satisfies the conservation relation\n$$\n[T]_{\\text{tot}} = [T] + [V\\!:\\!T] + [S\\!:\\!T].\n$$\nAt high cytosolic $[S]$, by the law of mass action and Le Chatelier’s principle, formation of $S\\!:\\!T$ is favored, decreasing $[T]$ and thereby decreasing $[V\\!:\\!T]$ at equilibrium for any given $[V]$. Combining the equilibria,\n$$\n[V\\!:\\!T] = \\frac{[V][T]}{K_{d,V}}, \\qquad [S\\!:\\!T] = \\frac{[S][T]}{K_{d,S}}.\n$$\nSubstituting into the conservation equation and solving for $[T]$,\n$$\n[T]_{\\text{tot}} = [T] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[V]}{K_{d,V}} + \\frac{[S]}{K_{d,S}} \\right)\n\\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad\n[T] = \\frac{[T]_{\\text{tot}}}{1 + \\frac{[V]}{K_{d,V}} + \\frac{[S]}{K_{d,S}} }.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\n[V\\!:\\!T] = \\frac{[V]}{K_{d,V}} \\cdot \\frac{[T]_{\\text{tot}}}{1 + \\frac{[V]}{K_{d,V}} + \\frac{[S]}{K_{d,S}} }.\n$$\nAs $[S]$ becomes large, the denominator increases, reducing $[V\\!:\\!T]$. Therefore, the number of fusion-competent complexes per release site decreases.\n\n4) Functional consequence for evoked release: Because $S$ sequesters $T$ into nonproductive $S\\!:\\!T$, the readily releasable pool primed with trans-SNAREs is reduced, leading to a significant reduction in the number of vesicles that fuse in response to a single action potential. The fragment cannot increase fusion because it lacks a transmembrane anchor and cannot generate trans-bridging force; it also does not inherently accelerate the kinetics of those few complexes that still form. It does not completely block docking, which relies on additional scaffolds and interactions beyond SNARE zippering, and the inhibition is not selective for spontaneous release since the same competitive mechanism affects both spontaneous and evoked assembly of $V\\!:\\!T$.\n\n5) Evaluation of options:\n- A is consistent with competitive sequestration of t-SNAREs by $S$, reducing $[V\\!:\\!T]$ and thus vesicles fused per action potential.\n- B is incorrect because $S$ forms nonproductive complexes and reduces, rather than assists, formation of functional acceptor complexes.\n- C is incorrect because $S$ does not enhance the rate of fusion of individual vesicles; it reduces the availability of $T$ for productive complexes.\n- D is incorrect because docking is not completely blocked by loss of trans-SNARE assembly; vesicles can still dock via other protein interactions, though priming/fusion is impaired.\n- E is incorrect because the competitive sequestration of $T$ affects both spontaneous and evoked release; it is not selective for spontaneous events.\n\nTherefore, the most likely primary consequence is a significant reduction in the number of vesicles that fuse per action potential.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2351975"}, {"introduction": "The fusion of a primed vesicle is not automatic; it is tightly controlled by the influx of calcium ($Ca^{2+}$).
