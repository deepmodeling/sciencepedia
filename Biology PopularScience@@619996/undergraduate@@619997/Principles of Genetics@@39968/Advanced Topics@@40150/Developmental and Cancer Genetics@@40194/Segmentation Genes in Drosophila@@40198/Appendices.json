We need to analyze the regulatory functions of Bcd and Nos and determine the consequences of their absence.\n\nFirst, let's establish the wild-type situation as described in the problem statement.\n1.  **Hunchback (Hb) regulation:** The maternal *hunchback* mRNA is uniformly distributed. The Nanos protein, which forms a posterior-to-anterior (P->A) gradient, represses the translation of this mRNA. This repression is strongest at the posterior and weakest at the anterior. Consequently, in a wild-type embryo, Hunchback protein is synthesized primarily in the anterior, forming an anterior-to-posterior (A->P) gradient.\n2.  **Caudal (Cad) regulation:** The maternal *caudal* mRNA is also uniformly distributed. The Bicoid protein, which forms an anterior-to-posterior (A->P) gradient, represses the translation of this mRNA. This repression is strongest at the anterior and weakest at the posterior. As a result, in a wild-type embryo, Caudal protein is synthesized mainly in the posterior, forming a posterior-to-anterior (P->A) gradient.\n\nNow, we consider the specified double-mutant embryo, which comes from a mother homozygous for null mutations in both *bicoid* and *nanos*. This means the embryo will contain no functional Bicoid protein and no functional Nanos protein.\n\nLet's analyze the effect on each protein individually in this mutant background.\n\n**Effect on Hunchback (Hb) protein:**\nIn the wild-type, the translation of the uniform maternal *hunchback* mRNA is repressed in the posterior by the Nanos protein. In the double-mutant embryo, there is no Nanos protein. Therefore, the repression of *hunchback* mRNA translation is completely lifted. Since the maternal *hunchback* mRNA is uniformly distributed throughout the embryo, it will be translated everywhere. This will result in a uniform distribution of Hunchback protein throughout the embryo.\n\n**Effect on Caudal (Cad) protein:**\nIn the wild-type, the translation of the uniform maternal *caudal* mRNA is repressed in the anterior by the Bicoid protein. In the double-mutant embryo, there is no Bicoid protein. Therefore, the repression of *caudal* mRNA translation is also completely lifted. Since the maternal *caudal* mRNA is uniformly distributed, it will be translated everywhere. This will result in a uniform distribution of Caudal protein throughout the embryo.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn an embryo lacking both maternal Bicoid and Nanos function, the repressors for both *caudal* and *hunchback* mRNA translation are absent. Both uniformly distributed maternal mRNAs will be translated freely along the entire anterior-posterior axis. Thus, both Hunchback protein and Caudal protein will be uniformly distributed.\n\nComparing this outcome with the given choices:\n- A. Hunchback protein is uniformly distributed; Caudal protein is uniformly distributed. - This matches our conclusion.\n- B. Hunchback protein forms an anterior-to-posterior gradient; Caudal protein is uniformly distributed. - This describes a *bicoid* single mutant.\n- C. Hunchback protein is uniformly distributed; Caudal protein forms a posterior-to-anterior gradient. - This describes a *nanos* single mutant.\n- D. Hunchback protein forms an anterior-to-posterior gradient; Caudal protein forms a posterior-to-anterior gradient. - This describes the wild-type condition.\n- E. No Hunchback protein is present; no Caudal protein is present. - This is incorrect; the maternal mRNAs are present and Bicoid/Nanos are repressors, not activators, of translation.\n- F. Hunchback protein forms a posterior-to-anterior gradient; Caudal protein is uniformly distributed. - This pattern is not expected from the known regulatory network.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is that both proteins are uniformly distributed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1519421"}, {"introduction": "Once broad regions are defined by maternal and gap genes, the embryo must be subdivided into smaller, repeating units. The expression pattern of a gene provides a powerful clue to its role in this process. This problem asks you to act like a developmental biologist, using an observed expression pattern of seven stripes to classify an unknown gene within the segmentation hierarchy [@problem_id:1519464].", "problem": "In the early embryonic development of the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*, a cascade of gene expression events establishes the body plan along the anterior-posterior axis. This process is governed by a hierarchy of segmentation genes. These genes are broadly classified based on their expression patterns and the mutant phenotypes they produce. The major functional classes are: Maternal-effect genes, which establish the initial polarity of the embryo; Gap genes, which are expressed in broad domains and define large regions of the embryo; Pair-rule genes, which are expressed in repeating stripes and establish the parasegmental boundaries; and Segment-polarity genes, which refine these boundaries and establish cell fates within each parasegment.\n\nA developmental biologist is studying a novel gene, designated *stripey*, that is essential for proper segmentation. To determine its place in the genetic hierarchy, the biologist performs an in-situ hybridization experiment on wild-type blastoderm-stage embryos using a probe specific to the *stripey* messenger RNA (mRNA). The results show that the *stripey* mRNA is localized in a distinct pattern of seven transverse stripes along the length of the embryo. Based on this specific expression pattern, to which of the following functional classes of segmentation genes does *stripey* most likely belong?\n\nA. Maternal-effect gene\n\nB. Gap gene\n\nC. Pair-rule gene\n\nD. Segment-polarity gene\n\nE.

The key piece of information is that the gene's mRNA is expressed in seven transverse stripes in the blastoderm embryo. We will evaluate each option to determine which class exhibits this characteristic pattern.\n\nThe establishment of the *Drosophila* body plan follows a hierarchical model:\n1.  **Maternal-effect genes**: These are transcribed in the mother, and their mRNAs (like *bicoid* and *nanos*) are deposited into the egg. They form broad concentration gradients of proteins from the anterior or posterior poles. Their expression pattern is a gradient, not a series of distinct stripes. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\n2.  **Gap genes**: These genes (e.g., *hunchback*, *Krüppel*, *knirps*) are the first zygotic genes to be expressed, activated by the maternal-effect protein gradients. They are expressed in broad, contiguous domains, often one or two per embryo, that correspond to several future segments. A seven-stripe pattern is inconsistent with the function of gap genes, which define larger regions. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Pair-rule genes**: These genes (e.g., *even-skipped*, *fushi tarazu*) are regulated by the gap genes. Their defining characteristic is their expression in a pattern of seven transverse stripes. The *Drosophila* embryo is composed of 14 parasegments, and each stripe of a pair-rule gene corresponds to either the even-numbered or the odd-numbered parasegments, thus establishing a two-segment periodicity. The observed seven-stripe pattern for the *stripey* gene is the hallmark of a pair-rule gene. Therefore, option C is the correct classification.\n\n4.  **Segment-polarity genes**: These genes (e.g., *engrailed*, *wingless*) are regulated by the pair-rule genes. Their expression is refined to a pattern of fourteen stripes, with one stripe per parasegment. This class of genes defines the anterior and posterior boundaries within each parasegment. The observed pattern is seven stripes, not fourteen. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\n5.  **Homeotic (Hox) genes**: These genes (e.g., *Antennapedia*, *Ultrabithorax*) are activated later in development by a combination of gap and pair-rule gene products. They are not considered segmentation genes in the same sense; rather, they are selector genes that specify the identity of individual segments (e.g., determining whether a segment will develop legs or wings). Their expression is confined to specific domains corresponding to the segments whose identity they control, not a repeating stripe pattern across the entire early embryo. Therefore, option E is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the unique seven-stripe expression pattern is the defining characteristic of the pair-rule gene class.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1519464"}, {"introduction": "The hierarchical nature of segmentation gene action has direct consequences that can be observed in genetic crosses.
