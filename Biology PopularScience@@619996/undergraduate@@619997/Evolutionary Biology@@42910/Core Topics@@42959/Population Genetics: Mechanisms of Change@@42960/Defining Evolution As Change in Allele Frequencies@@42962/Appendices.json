The flower color is determined by a single gene with two alleles: a dominant allele $R$ for red flowers and a recessive allele $r$ for white flowers. The team has collected data from the three distinct subpopulations.\n\n1.  **North Ridge Population**: A complete census of this population found 1000 individuals. Genetic screening revealed the following genotype counts: 250 individuals with genotype RR, 500 with Rr, and 250 with rr.\n\n2.  **South Face Population**: This larger population is estimated to contain 3000 individuals. Due to the difficulty of sampling, the team determined the genotype frequencies from a representative sample: the frequency of the RR genotype is 0.64, the frequency of the Rr genotype is 0.32, and the frequency of the rr genotype is 0.04.\n\n3.  **East Valley Population**: This population of 2000 individuals is known to be in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium.
