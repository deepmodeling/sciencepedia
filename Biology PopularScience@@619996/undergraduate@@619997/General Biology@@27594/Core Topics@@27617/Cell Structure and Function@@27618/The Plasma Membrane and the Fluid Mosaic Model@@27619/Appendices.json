The fluid mosaic model of the plasma membrane is no exception, and one of its most compelling visual confirmations comes from the freeze-fracture technique. This practice challenges you to interpret the classic results of a freeze-fracture experiment, revealing how the pattern of bumps and pits on the fractured faces of the membrane provides direct proof for the \"mosaic\" aspect of the model—the embedding of proteins within the lipid bilayer. [@problem_id:2322421]", "problem": "The fluid mosaic model describes the structure of the plasma membrane. A key piece of experimental evidence supporting this model comes from a technique called freeze-fracture electron microscopy. In this process, a cell is rapidly frozen and then physically fractured. The fracture plane often splits the membrane's lipid bilayer into its two leaflets: the P face (the interior face of the leaflet adjacent to the cytoplasm) and the E face (the interior face of the leaflet adjacent to the extracellular space). When these fractured surfaces are examined with an Electron Microscope (EM), the P face is typically observed to be studded with numerous bumps, while the E face shows a series of corresponding pits.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most direct and significant conclusion that can be drawn from the observation of these bumps and pits on the interior faces of the fractured membrane?\n\nA. The membrane is selectively permeable, controlling the passage of substances into and out of the cell.\n\nB. The phospholipid molecules of the membrane can move laterally, demonstrating the fluidity of the structure.\n\nC. The membrane is a mosaic of protein molecules embedded or dispersed within the phospholipid bilayer.\n\nD. The cholesterol molecules present in the membrane regulate its fluidity at different temperatures.\n\nE. The external surface of the plasma membrane is coated with a glycocalyx made of carbohydrates.", "solution": "To determine the correct conclusion, we must understand what the freeze-fracture technique reveals about the membrane's architecture.\n\nThe technique involves freezing the specimen and then striking it, which causes a fracture to propagate along lines of weakness. In a cell, the weakest plane is often the hydrophobic interior of the plasma membrane. This splits the membrane into two halves, or leaflets, exposing their internal faces.\n\nThe bumps observed on one face (the P face) and the corresponding pits on the other (the E face) are the key observations. These features demonstrate that there are structures that span the hydrophobic core of the membrane. When the membrane is fractured, these structures are pulled apart along with the lipids. Some of them remain embedded in one leaflet, creating a \"bump,\" while leaving a \"pit\" or impression in the other leaflet.\n\nThese embedded structures are integral membrane proteins. This observation was crucial because it refuted earlier models, such as the Davson-Danielli model, which proposed that proteins formed smooth, continuous layers on either side of the phospholipid bilayer, like a sandwich. The freeze-fracture evidence showed that proteins are not just on the surfaces but are actually intercalated within the lipid bilayer.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n\nA. The membrane is selectively permeable, controlling the passage of substances into and out of the cell. While this is a true function of the plasma membrane, and integral proteins are often responsible for transport, the visual evidence of bumps and pits itself does not directly demonstrate the process of transport or permeability. It only shows the structural arrangement.\n\nB. The phospholipid molecules of the membrane can move laterally, demonstrating the fluidity of the structure. The \"fluid\" aspect of the fluid mosaic model is a critical concept, but it is demonstrated by different experiments, most famously Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP). The static image from freeze-fracture does not, by itself, show movement.\n\nC. The membrane is a mosaic of protein molecules embedded or dispersed within the phospholipid bilayer. This statement is the most direct interpretation of the visual evidence. The \"bumps\" are the protein molecules, and their presence within the fractured lipid bilayer confirms that they are embedded, forming a \"mosaic\" pattern. This is precisely what the \"mosaic\" part of the fluid mosaic model describes.\n\nD. The cholesterol molecules present in the membrane regulate its fluidity at different temperatures. This is a true statement about the function of cholesterol in animal cell membranes. However, individual cholesterol molecules are too small to be resolved as the large \"bumps\" seen in freeze-fracture micrographs. This observation does not provide direct evidence for the role of cholesterol.\n\nE. The external surface of the plasma membrane is coated with a glycocalyx made of carbohydrates. The glycocalyx exists on the *extracellular surface* of the membrane, not within the hydrophobic core that is exposed by freeze-fracture. Therefore, this technique does not provide direct evidence for the glycocalyx.\n\nTherefore, the observation of bumps and pits is the primary evidence for the \"mosaic\" component of the fluid mosaic model, showing proteins embedded within the lipid bilayer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2322421"}, {"introduction": "Once the \"mosaic\" arrangement of proteins was established, the next critical question was whether these components were fixed in place or free to move. This thought experiment recreates the landmark Frye and Edidin cell fusion experiment, a beautifully simple and elegant demonstration of the membrane's fluidity. By predicting the outcome of fusing human and mouse cells, you will explore the principle of lateral diffusion and solidify your understanding of why the term \"fluid\" is essential to the fluid mosaic model. [@problem_id:2322420]", "problem": "A cell biologist is investigating the properties of the plasma membrane by creating hybrid cells. The experiment uses two types of cells: human cells that have a specific surface protein called 'Protein-H', and mouse cells that have a different surface protein called 'Protein-M'. Two types of fluorescently-labeled antibodies are prepared: anti-H antibodies linked to a green fluorescent dye and anti-M antibodies linked to a red fluorescent dye.\n\nThe experimental procedure is as follows:\n1.  The human and mouse cells are induced to fuse, forming single hybrid cells known as heterokaryons.\n2.  Immediately after fusion (time $t=0$), the cells are treated with both the red and green antibodies. The initial observation confirms that the surface of each hybrid cell is sharply divided, with one hemisphere exhibiting pure red fluorescence (from Protein-M) and the other exhibiting pure green fluorescence (from Protein-H).\n3.  The hybrid cells are then incubated in a culture medium at a physiological temperature of $37^\\circ\\text{C}$ for 45 minutes.\n4.  After the incubation period, the distribution of red and green fluorescence on the surface of the heterokaryons is observed again using a fluorescence microscope.\n\nBased on the widely accepted fluid mosaic model of the plasma membrane, which of the following outcomes most accurately describes the expected observation after the 45-minute incubation period?\n\nA. The hybrid cells have divided back into separate, smaller human and mouse cells, each with their original uniform fluorescence.\n\nB. The fluorescence is no longer on the cell surface; both red and green signals are now concentrated within the nucleus of the hybrid cell.\n\nC. The green-fluorescing proteins and red-fluorescing proteins have fully intermingled, resulting in a random, mosaic pattern of red and green signals across the entire surface of the hybrid cell.\n\nD. The cell surface remains sharply divided into a red hemisphere and a green hemisphere, identical to the observation at time $t=0$.\n\nE. Only the green-fluorescing proteins have moved, distributing themselves across the entire cell surface to mix with the red-fluorescing proteins, which have remained fixed in their original hemisphere.", "solution": "According to the fluid mosaic model, the plasma membrane is a two-dimensional fluid in which lipids and many membrane proteins undergo lateral diffusion. When human and mouse cells are fused to form heterokaryons, the membrane proteins originating from the two parental membranes can diffuse within the continuous bilayer. Immediately after fusion and antibody labeling at time $t=0$, a sharp hemispheric segregation is observed because the proteins have not yet diffused. Over time at physiological temperature, lateral diffusion leads to mixing of the proteins across the membrane surface.\n\nThe lateral diffusion process can be described by two-dimensional Brownian motion. If a membrane protein has diffusion coefficient $D$, the mean squared displacement after time $t$ is\n$$\n\\langle r^{2} \\rangle = 4Dt.\n$$\nFor sufficiently large $t$ at physiological temperature, $\\langle r^{2} \\rangle$ becomes comparable to or larger than the square of the characteristic cell-surface length scale, implying extensive mixing of the two initially segregated protein populations across the cell surface. Because both Protein-H and Protein-M are integral membrane proteins embedded in the same continuous bilayer of the hybrid cell, both populations undergo lateral diffusion unless specifically immobilized by strong cytoskeletal anchoring or other constraints; the classic heterokaryon experiment demonstrates that they intermingle.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: the cells do not divide back into separate human and mouse cells over this timescale as a consequence of membrane fluidity; the observation concerns membrane protein distribution, not reversal of cell fusion.\n- B is incorrect: the labeled membrane proteins and their bound antibodies are associated with the plasma membrane and do not rapidly accumulate within the nucleus under these conditions.\n- C is correct: both red- and green-labeled membrane proteins laterally diffuse and intermingle, producing a mosaic distribution across the entire cell surface after the incubation.\n- D is incorrect: a persistent sharp hemispheric separation would contradict the lateral mobility central to the fluid mosaic model.\n- E is incorrect: there is no basis for only one color’s proteins to diffuse while the others remain immobile; both classes are expected to diffuse unless asymmetrically constrained, and the canonical outcome is symmetric mixing.\n\nTherefore, the expected observation after the incubation is a random, mosaic intermingling of red and green signals across the entire surface of the hybrid cell.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2322420"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond qualitative descriptions, biophysics allows us to quantify the physical properties of cellular structures.
