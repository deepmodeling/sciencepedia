This exercise [@problem_id:2133420] explores the kinetics of trypsinogen activation, a classic system featuring both auto-activation (positive feedback) and autolysis (self-inactivation). By comparing the behavior of the wild-type enzyme to a hypothetical mutant that cannot self-inactivate, you will develop an intuition for how these competing reactions shape the overall profile of enzyme activity over time.", "problem": "In a protein biochemistry laboratory, two parallel experiments are designed to study the kinetics of trypsin, a serine protease. Trypsin is synthesized as an inactive zymogen, trypsinogen, which is activated by proteolytic cleavage. This activation can be initiated by the enzyme enterokinase and is then amplified through auto-activation, where active trypsin cleaves other trypsinogen molecules. Active trypsin is also subject to self-inactivation through autolysis at a specific site in its structure.\n\n**Setup A (Wild-Type):** A reaction mixture is prepared containing a starting concentration of wild-type trypsinogen, a fixed, high concentration of a chromogenic substrate that yields a colored product upon cleavage by trypsin, and a catalytic amount of enterokinase to initiate the reaction. The buffer conditions are optimal for trypsin activity.\n\n**Setup B (Mutant):** This setup is identical to Setup A in every respect (concentrations, temperature, buffer), except that it uses a mutant form of trypsinogen. This specific mutation completely prevents the autolysis (self-inactivation) process but has no effect on the rate of activation by enterokinase, the rate of auto-activation, or the enzyme's catalytic efficiency ($k_{cat}/K_M$) towards the chromogenic substrate.\n\nFor both setups, the formation of the colored product is monitored over an extended period of time, during which the substrate concentration remains high and is not a limiting factor.\n\nBased on the principles of enzyme kinetics and zymogen activation, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected kinetic profiles of product formation in Setup A versus Setup B?\n\nA. The reaction rate will be constant from the beginning in Setup B, while in Setup A, the rate will first increase and then decrease.\n\nB. In both setups, the reaction rate will initially increase due to auto-activation. However, in Setup A, the rate will subsequently decrease as active trypsin is depleted by autolysis, leading to an early plateau in total product. In Setup B, the active enzyme concentration will be sustained, resulting in a prolonged high reaction rate and a significantly greater final amount of product.\n\nC. The final amount of product formed will be identical in both setups, but the reaction in Setup B will reach the final plateau much more rapidly than the reaction in Setup A.\n\nD. The initial lag phase for product formation will be significantly longer in Setup B than in Setup A, but the maximum reaction rate achieved will be the same in both experiments.\n\nE. The mutation described for Setup B is destabilizing and will lead to rapid, non-specific aggregation of the protein, thus no product will be formed.", "solution": "Define $[Z](t)$ as trypsinogen, $[E](t)$ as active trypsin, $[I](t)$ as inactivated trypsin, $[S]$ as substrate (held high and effectively constant), and $[P](t)$ as product. Enterokinase-initiated activation is modeled as a pseudo-first-order process with rate constant $k_{1}$ (enterokinase present at fixed catalytic amount), auto-activation as a bimolecular process with rate constant $k_{2}$, and autolysis (self-inactivation) as a first-order loss of $[E]$ with rate constant $k_{d}$. The chromogenic substrate is in high, nonlimiting excess; define the catalytic rate under these conditions as\n$$\nv(t) \\equiv \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = \\frac{k_{cat}[E](t)[S]}{K_{M}+[S]} \\equiv \\alpha [E](t),\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha = \\frac{k_{cat}[S]}{K_{M}+[S]}$ is a constant.\n\nKinetic equations for Setup A (wild-type, with autolysis $k_{d}>0$) are\n$$\n\\frac{d[E]}{dt} = k_{1}[Z] + k_{2}[E][Z] - k_{d}[E],\\quad \\frac{d[Z]}{dt} = -k_{1}[Z] - k_{2}[E][Z],\\quad \\frac{d[I]}{dt} = k_{d}[E],\\quad \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = \\alpha [E].\n$$\nTotal zymogen-derived material is conserved as $[Z] + [E] + [I] = Z_{0}$, with $Z_{0} = [Z](0)$.\n\nKinetic equations for Setup B (mutant, no autolysis, $k_{d}=0$) are\n$$\n\\frac{d[E]}{dt} = k_{1}[Z] + k_{2}[E][Z],\\quad \\frac{d[Z]}{dt} = -k_{1}[Z] - k_{2}[E][Z],\\quad \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = \\alpha [E],\n$$\nwith conservation $[Z] + [E] = Z_{0}$.\n\nInitial acceleration of product formation in both setups follows from\n$$\n\\frac{dv}{dt} = \\alpha \\frac{d[E]}{dt} = \\alpha\\big(k_{1}[Z] + k_{2}[E][Z] - k_{d}[E]\\big).\n$$\nAt early times, $[E]$ is small and $[Z]\\approx Z_{0}$, hence $\\frac{dv}{dt} \\approx \\alpha k_{1}Z_{0} > 0$, so $v(t)$ increases initially in both A and B due to enterokinase seeding and the positive feedback term $k_{2}[E][Z]$ (auto-activation).\n\nLong-time behavior differs:\n- Setup A: As $[E]$ builds, autolysis contributes the loss term $-k_{d}[E]$. With $[Z]$ decreasing and $[E]$ significant, eventually $k_{d}[E]$ outweighs the activation terms, yielding $\\frac{dv}{dt}<0$ and a declining rate. In the limit $t\\to\\infty$, $[Z]\\to 0$ and $\\frac{d[E]}{dt}\\to -k_{d}[E]$, so $[E]\\to 0$ and thus $v\\to 0$. Consequently, $[P](t)$ approaches a finite plateau relatively early because the active enzyme pool is depleted by autolysis.\n- Setup B: With $k_{d}=0$, conservation gives $[E](t)=Z_{0}-[Z](t)$, and as $[Z]\\to 0$ one has $[E]\\to Z_{0}>0$. Therefore $v(t)=\\alpha [E](t)$ rises initially and then approaches a sustained high value $v_{\\infty}=\\alpha Z_{0}$. Product formation continues at this high rate for an extended period (limited only by eventual experimental termination or substrate depletion, which is stated not to occur over the monitoring window). Hence the cumulative product is much greater than in Setup A, which ceases early due to autolysis.\n\nThese dynamics directly match the statement that both reactions show an initial rate increase from auto-activation, Setup A then declines due to autolysis leading to an early plateau in product, while Setup B sustains a high rate and yields substantially more product over time.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2133420"}, {"introduction": "The remarkable precision of biological regulation stems from molecular recognition, and for proteolytic activation, this is encoded in the amino acid sequence surrounding the cleavage site.

In the wild-type human prothrombin activation site, the sequence is\n...Ile268-Glu269-Gly270-Arg271-Thr272-Phe273...\nwhich maps as follows relative to the Factor Xa cleavage between Arg271 (P1) and Thr272 (P1'):\nP4 = Ile268, P3 = Glu269, P2 = Gly270, P1 = Arg271, P1' = Thr272, P2' = Phe273.\nFactor Xa recognizes and cleaves efficiently at the P4-P1 motif Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg, with scissile bond after P1. Therefore, to abolish Factor Xa activation, the Arg at P1 must be removed and the P4-P1 motif should be disrupted.\n\nFor TEV protease, the canonical recognition sequence is Glu-Asn-Leu-Tyr-Phe-Gln-Gly with cleavage between Gln (P1) and Gly (P1'), i.e., P6 = Glu, P5 = Asn, P4 = Leu, P3 = Tyr, P2 = Phe, P1 = Gln, P1' = Gly, with the scissile bond between P1 and P1'. TEV protease has stringent requirements for P1 = Gln and P1' = Gly, and strong preferences for P4 = Leu, P3 = Tyr, and P2 = Phe for high catalytic efficiency, whereas P6 and P5 are less critical.\n\nWe therefore set design criteria:\n1) Abolish Factor Xa: eliminate Arg at P1 and disrupt the Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg motif.\n2) Enable selective and efficient TEV cleavage: introduce P1 = Gln and P1' = Gly, and, for maximal efficiency, install P4 = Leu, P3 = Tyr, P2 = Phe.\n\nWe evaluate each option by mapping the resulting P4-P1' sequence:\n- Option A: I268L, E269Y, G270F, R271Q, T272G yields Leu268-Tyr269-Phe270-Gln271-Gly272-Phe273, i.e., P4-P1' = Leu-Tyr-Phe-Gln|Gly. This matches the TEV core consensus P4-P1' exactly (L-Y-F-Q|G), providing P1 = Gln and P1' = Gly for specificity and efficiency, and removes Arg at P1, abolishing Factor Xa recognition.\n- Option B: G270Q, R271G yields P4-P1' = Ile-Glu-Gln-Gly|Thr. Here P1 is Gly, not Gln, so TEV cleavage is not enabled. Factor Xa motif is disrupted, but TEV specificity is not achieved.\n- Option C: R271Q, T272G yields P4-P1' = Ile-Glu-Gly-Gln|Gly. This installs the minimal TEV determinant at P1 = Gln and P1' = Gly and removes Arg at P1, thus abolishing Factor Xa. However, the upstream positions remain I-E-G (P4-P2), which is far from the optimal L-Y-F and is known to reduce TEV efficiency. Thus it is less effective than installing the full preferred core motif.\n- Option D: I268L, E269V, G270P, T272G yields P4-P1' = Leu-Val-Pro-Arg|Gly. The P1 remains Arg, so Factor Xa may still cleave; P1 is not Gln, so TEV is not installed.\n- Option E: R271G, T272Q yields P4-P1' = Ile-Glu-Gly-Gly|Gln. The P1/P1' residues are reversed relative to TEV requirements (P1 should be Gln and P1' should be Gly), so TEV is not installed; Factor Xa is abolished but the design goal is not met.\n\nTherefore, only Option A installs the optimal TEV core recognition motif L-Y-F-Q|G while simultaneously abolishing Factor Xa activation by removing the critical Arg at P1 and disrupting the P4-P1 motif of Factor Xa.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2133436"}, {"introduction": "To understand when and where zymogen activation occurs within a complex biological environment, such as on the surface of a cell, we need tools to visualize it.
