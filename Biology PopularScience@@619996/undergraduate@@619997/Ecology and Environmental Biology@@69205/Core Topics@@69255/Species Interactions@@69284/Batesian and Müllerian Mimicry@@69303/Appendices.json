This practice explores the fundamental conditions that favor the evolution of Batesian mimicry over alternative strategies like camouflage. By considering two different environments, you will analyze the critical role a venomous \"model\" species plays in providing the selective pressure for a harmless \"mimic\" to adopt its warning signals [@problem_id:1831747].", "problem": "An ancestral population of a non-venomous, palatable snake species is introduced to two isolated tropical islands, Island S and Island A. The islands are ecologically similar, with comparable habitats and a suite of avian and mammalian predators that possess color vision and can learn to avoid dangerous prey.\n\nThe key difference between the islands is the presence of other species. Island S is home to a highly venomous coral snake species that is abundant and displays a conspicuous aposematic (warning) coloration of red, yellow, and black rings. In contrast, Island A has no venomous snakes or any other animal that exhibits a similar red, yellow, and black warning pattern.\n\nAssuming sufficient time has passed for natural selection to act, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected evolutionary divergence in coloration for the harmless snake populations on Island S and Island A?\n\nA. The population on Island S will evolve the red, yellow, and black ring pattern, while the population on Island A will retain the ancestral coloration, as there is no selective pressure to change.\n\nB. Both populations will evolve the red, yellow, and black ring pattern, as this bright coloration is inherently effective at deterring all predators, regardless of experience.\n\nC. The population on Island S will evolve cryptic coloration (camouflage) to avoid being mistaken for the venomous model, while the population on Island A will evolve the red, yellow, and black ring pattern due to a lack of negative selection.\n\nD. The population on Island S will evolve the red, yellow, and black ring pattern, while the population on Island A will evolve cryptic coloration that blends with the local environment.\n\nE. Both populations will evolve cryptic coloration to best avoid detection, as being conspicuous is always a disadvantage for a harmless species.", "solution": "We begin by identifying the relevant evolutionary principles. Predators with color vision that can learn to avoid dangerous prey will associate a conspicuous warning pattern with unprofitability when repeated adverse experiences occur. Aposematism evolves in genuinely unprofitable prey (e.g., venomous species) and can be exploited by harmless, palatable species via Batesian mimicry, where a palatable mimic gains protection by resembling a defended model. The effectiveness of Batesian mimicry depends on predator learning and is frequency-dependent: it is advantageous for the mimic primarily when the defended model is sufficiently common, so that predators maintain avoidance of the warning pattern.\n\nOn Island S, the venomous coral snake with conspicuous red, yellow, and black rings is abundant. Predators will learn to associate this particular color pattern with danger due to adverse experiences with the venomous species. Therefore, natural selection favors harmless snakes that resemble the coral snake pattern, because such individuals will be avoided more often by predators. This constitutes Batesian mimicry and generates selection for the evolution of the red, yellow, and black ring pattern in the harmless population. The presence and abundance of the model ensure that the mimic’s conspicuousness yields a net fitness benefit.\n\nOn Island A, there is no venomous coral snake or any species exhibiting a similar warning pattern. Thus, predators have no basis to associate the red, yellow, and black pattern with danger. For a palatable species, adopting a conspicuous, non-reinforced warning pattern would increase detection and attack rates without any avoidance benefit. Consequently, selection will favor reduced detectability, i.e., cryptic coloration that blends with the local environment, rather than conspicuous patterns. There is also active selective pressure to change if the ancestral state is not optimally cryptic in the local environment; hence it is inaccurate to claim there is no selective pressure on Island A.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because stating there is no selective pressure to change on Island A is wrong; selection favors crypsis in the absence of a protected model.\n- Option B is incorrect because bright coloration is not inherently deterrent; it requires learned association with unprofitability.\n- Option C is incorrect because on Island S resemblance to the venomous model is beneficial, not detrimental; cryptic coloration would forgo the available protective resemblance.\n- Option D is correct: on Island S, the harmless snakes evolve the warning ring pattern via Batesian mimicry; on Island A, they evolve cryptic coloration due to the absence of a model and the costs of conspicuousness.\n- Option E is incorrect because conspicuousness is advantageous for harmless species only when protected by a common unprofitable model.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1831747"}, {"introduction": "While the presence of a model is necessary for Batesian mimicry, the protective benefit is not absolute and weakens as mimics become more common relative to models. This quantitative exercise introduces the core concept of negative frequency-dependent selection, a dynamic that governs many mimicry systems. By applying a simple mathematical model, you will calculate how the probability of a predator being deterred changes as the mimic population grows, providing a concrete understanding of this crucial ecological principle [@problem_id:1831740].", "problem": "In an ecosystem, a species of harmless syrphid fly has evolved to mimic the black-and-yellow warning coloration of a local, venomous wasp species. This is a classic example of Batesian mimicry, where a palatable species gains protection by resembling a noxious one. The effectiveness of this mimicry, however, depends on the relative populations of the model (the wasp) and the mimic (the fly), as this influences the learning behavior of local predators, such as birds.\n\nA simple model describes the \"mimicry effectiveness index,\" denoted by $E$, for an individual fly. This index represents the probability that a predator, upon encountering a mimic fly, will be deterred from attacking due to prior negative experiences with the noxious wasp model. The model is given by the equation:\n$$E = \\frac{\\alpha N_W}{\\alpha N_W + \\beta N_F}$$\nwhere:\n- $N_W$ is the population size of the wasps.\n- $N_F$ is the population size of the flies.\n- $\\alpha$ is a 'learning parameter' representing how effectively a single encounter with a wasp teaches a predator avoidance.\n- $\\beta$ is a 'forgetting parameter' representing how effectively an encounter with a palatable fly causes a predator to abandon its learned avoidance.\n\nConsider a stable ecosystem where the wasp population is $N_W = 5000$. The predator learning and forgetting parameters have been estimated to be $\\alpha = 0.8$ and $\\beta = 0.1$. Initially, the mimic fly population is negligible, but due to the survival advantage conferred by mimicry, its population grows significantly.\n\nCalculate the value of the mimicry effectiveness index, $E$, for an individual fly when the fly population has grown to $N_F = 30000$.

This thought experiment encourages you to think critically about the mechanism of predator learning by comparing the consequences of a lethal versus a non-lethal model. Analyzing this distinction reveals a deeper, more nuanced understanding of what allows a population of mimics to thrive and how predator behavior is a key driver of this evolutionary dynamic [@problem_id:1831755].", "problem": "Two geographically and ecologically isolated islands, Island Alpha and Island Beta, each host a distinct predator-prey system. Both islands are inhabited by the same species of insectivorous bird, which serves as the primary predator.\n\nOn both islands, there exists a species of harmless beetle that has evolved to visually resemble a toxic model species of beetle. This is a classic case of Batesian mimicry. The predator bird learns to associate the distinctive coloration and pattern of the model beetle with a negative experience, and consequently avoids both the model and the mimic.\n\nThe crucial difference between the two islands lies in the nature of the model's toxicity:\n- On Island Alpha, the model beetle produces a potent neurotoxin that is invariably lethal to any bird that consumes it.\n- On Island Beta, the model beetle produces an emetic toxin that, while not lethal, induces severe nausea and vomiting in any bird that consumes it. The bird makes a full recovery after a short period.\n\nIn both systems, the fitness of the mimic species depends on its ability to avoid predation by tricking the birds. The effectiveness of this deception is influenced by the relative abundances of the mimic and model species. Assume that all other ecological factors (e.g., resource availability, alternative prey, habitat structure) are identical on both islands.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly predicts the island that can support a higher stable relative abundance of the mimic species (i.e., a higher ratio of mimics to models) and provides the correct reasoning?\n\nA. Island Alpha, because the lethal consequence for the predator creates an extremely strong selective pressure to avoid the warning pattern, thus protecting even a large number of mimics.\n\nB. Island Beta, because a non-lethal negative experience allows individual predators to learn and remember to avoid the warning pattern, which creates a large pool of educated predators that will protect the mimics.\n\nC. The maximum sustainable relative abundance of mimics will be approximately equal on both islands, because the warning pattern is the same and the evolutionary pressure on the predator population to recognize it is driven by the presence of any negative consequence.\n\nD. Island Beta, because the non-lethal nature of the toxin means that predators will occasionally \"test\" the warning signal, leading to more frequent encounters that reinforce the signal's meaning throughout the predator population.", "solution": "We analyze the stability of Batesian mimicry under two types of model defense by tracking predator learning and its consequences for the rate at which mimics are attacked.\n\nLet $p$ be the fraction of models among signal-bearing prey (models $+$ mimics), and $q = 1 - p$ the fraction of mimics. Assume a naive predator samples signal-bearing prey at random with respect to the warning pattern until a negative consequence alters its future behavior.\n\nKey principle: In Batesian mimicry, protection of mimics depends on predators avoiding the warning pattern. Avoidance can arise via individual learning within a predator’s lifetime or via selection among predators across generations. Frequency-dependent selection implies that as $q/p$ increases, predators obtain a higher expected payoff from attacking the warning signal, destabilizing mimicry unless learning strongly suppresses attacks.\n\nFor a naive predator, the number of mimics it eats before its first encounter with a model is geometrically distributed with success probability $p$. Therefore, the expected number of mimics eaten before the first model is\n$$\nE[\\text{mimics eaten before first model}] \\;=\\; \\frac{q}{p}.\n$$\nThis immediate cost to mimics per naive predator is the same on both islands. The crucial difference is what happens after the predator’s first encounter with a model.\n\nIsland Alpha (lethal model):\n- Upon encountering the first model, the predator dies. There is no within-lifetime learning; individual predators never become educated avoiders because the learning event is fatal.\n- Consequently, there is a continual stream of naive predators (produced by reproduction or immigration) that each consume an expected $\\frac{q}{p}$ mimics before dying on a model. Because no predator survives to become an avoider, there is no accumulating pool of educated predators to suppress future attacks. As $q/p$ increases, mimics pay a high cost because each naive predator is expected to consume more mimics before dying.\n- Although there is selection across generations for any innate avoidance, at any given time the attacks come predominantly from naive individuals, which are never converted into avoiders and are continually renewed. This limits the maximum stable $q/p$.\n\nIsland Beta (emetic, non-lethal model):\n- Upon encountering the first model, the predator experiences a strong but non-lethal aversive stimulus, learns, and thereafter avoids attacking the warning pattern.\n- The same immediate expectation $\\frac{q}{p}$ mimics per naive predator applies before the first model encounter, but critically, the predator survives and becomes an educated avoider. Over time, this produces a large pool of educated predators that refrain from attacking both models and mimics.\n- Because naive predators are converted into educated ones instead of being removed, the proportion of naive predators in the population declines, which reduces the ongoing rate of attacks on mimics. This allows a higher stable $q/p$ than on Island Alpha.\n\nComparing islands: The mechanism that allows a higher sustainable relative abundance of mimics is the accumulation of educated, living predators that avoid the warning pattern, thereby protecting mimics. This mechanism operates on Island Beta but not on Island Alpha. Therefore Island Beta can support a higher stable relative abundance of the mimic species. This matches the reasoning that non-lethal negative experiences enable learning and memory that protect mimics.\n\nAmong the options, statement B identifies the correct island and the correct mechanism (survival, learning, and a large pool of educated predators). Statement D’s emphasis on more frequent testing is not the key mechanism and may even be counterproductive; a single strong aversive experience typically suffices, and the important difference is survival and accumulation of avoiders, not increased testing frequency. Statements A and C are incorrect for the reasons above.\n\nThus, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1831755"}]}
