[@problem_id:2269873]", "problem": "A patient is diagnosed with Celiac Disease based on characteristic gastrointestinal symptoms and serological tests that reveal high levels of IgA autoantibodies targeting the enzyme tissue transglutaminase (tTG). A subsequent duodenal biopsy confirms the diagnosis, showing significant atrophy of the intestinal villi, crypt hyperplasia, and an increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes.\n\nIn the pathogenesis of Celiac Disease, gliadin, a protein component of gluten, crosses the intestinal epithelial barrier into the lamina propria. There, the tTG enzyme deamidates specific glutamine residues within the gliadin peptides. This modification significantly increases the binding affinity of these peptides for specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class II molecules, namely HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, which are expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs).\n\nGiven this immunopathological context, which of the following statements provides the most accurate explanation for the primary mechanism causing the observed intestinal tissue destruction?\n\nA. The high concentration of anti-tTG antibodies binds to tTG released from damaged cells or present on cell surfaces, activating the classical complement pathway and leading to membrane attack complex formation on enterocytes.\n\nB. B-cells that have differentiated into plasma cells secrete large amounts of gliadin-specific IgA, which coats the intestinal lumen, preventing nutrient absorption and causing villous atrophy through a process of competitive inhibition.\n\nC. The tTG enzyme itself, upon binding to gliadin peptides, undergoes a conformational change that imbues it with direct, toxic activity against the intestinal epithelial cells, leading to apoptosis.\n\nD. Macrophages in the lamina propria phagocytose the circulating anti-tTG antibody-tTG complexes, triggering a \"frustrated phagocytosis\" response that releases of lysosomal enzymes and causes bystander damage to the villous architecture.\n\nE. Deamidated gliadin peptides are presented by APCs via HLA-DQ2/DQ8 to gluten-specific $CD4^+$ T helper cells, which become activated and orchestrate a pro-inflammatory cytokine-mediated response that ultimately destroys the villous structure.", "solution": "We start from the essential sequence of immunopathological events: dietary gliadin crosses the intestinal epithelium into the lamina propria. Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) deamidates specific glutamine residues in gliadin, converting them into glutamic acid residues, thereby increasing negative charge and raising the binding affinity of these peptides for HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). APCs then present deamidated gliadin peptides to gluten-specific $CD4^+$ T helper cells. These T cells become activated and differentiate, predominantly along a Th1-type profile, producing pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN-gamma) that drive macrophage activation and tissue remodeling. Concomitantly, IL-15 in the intestinal mucosa promotes activation and expansion of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), many of which are CD8+ T cells that recognize stress-induced ligands (such as MICA) and mediate cytotoxic killing of enterocytes via perforin/granzyme pathways. The combined effects of Th1 cytokine-driven inflammation and IEL-mediated cytotoxicity lead to villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes.\n\nEvaluate the options against this mechanism:\n\nA. Anti-tTG IgA are valuable diagnostic markers but are not the primary mediators of tissue injury in celiac disease. IgA is relatively poor at activating the classical complement pathway, and complement-mediated membrane attack complex formation on enterocytes is not the central pathogenic mechanism. Moreover, tTG is primarily intracellular or extracellular matrix-associated; the hallmark pathology is driven by T cell-mediated processes rather than complement.\n\nB. Secreted gliadin-specific IgA in the lumen does not cause villous atrophy by competitive inhibition of nutrient absorption. Antibody coating of luminal antigen is not the driver of the characteristic mucosal destruction.\n\nC. There is no evidence that tTG acquires direct toxic activity upon binding gliadin. The enzyme’s role is enzymatic deamidation that enhances antigenicity; it does not itself kill enterocytes.\n\nD. Immune complex-mediated frustrated phagocytosis with bystander damage is not the principal mechanism in celiac disease. The disease is not classically immune complex-mediated; instead, it is predominantly T cell-driven.\n\nE. This precisely states the established mechanism: deamidated gliadin peptides presented by HLA-DQ2/DQ8 activate gluten-specific $CD4^+$ T helper cells, inducing a cytokine-mediated inflammatory cascade and IEL cytotoxicity that destroy the villous architecture. This is the primary cause of the observed tissue destruction.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation of the primary mechanism is the T cell-mediated response described in option E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2269873"}, {"introduction": "Effective treatment for autoimmune diseases often hinges on restoring immune balance, not just eliminating inflammatory cells.

You will apply the fundamental two-signal model of T-cell activation to explain how a gut microbe could transform a harmless dietary protein into a potent immune trigger, honing your skills in immunological reasoning and hypothesis evaluation. [@problem_id:2269841]", "problem": "Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by dietary gluten in individuals with specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class II alleles, primarily HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8. The canonical pathway involves the human enzyme tissue transglutaminase (tTG), which deamidates glutamine residues in gliadin (a component of gluten). This modification enhances the binding of gliadin peptides to HLA-DQ2/DQ8 on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), leading to the activation of pathogenic $CD4^+$ T-cells.\n\nResearchers are investigating a \"microbial co-factor\" hypothesis for the initial loss of tolerance to gluten. They have identified a strain of gut bacteria, *Lactobacillus destructans*, prevalent in some individuals prior to celiac disease diagnosis. This bacterium expresses a novel enzyme, a microbial transpeptidase (mTP). The mTP enzyme catalyzes a reaction where it covalently links a glutamine residue within a key immunogenic gliadin peptide to a lysine residue on one of the bacterium's own cell wall-associated proteins. This creates a stable gliadin-bacterial protein conjugate. Further characterization reveals the bacterial protein component of this conjugate is a potent agonist for Toll-like Receptor 2 (TLR2), a pattern recognition receptor on the surface of APCs.\n\nBased on this scenario, which of the following statements provides the most complete and immunologically plausible explanation for how this bacterial action could trigger the *initial* activation of gliadin-specific $CD4^+$ T-cells in an HLA-DQ2-positive individual, thereby initiating the autoimmune cascade?\n\nA. The mTP enzyme itself acts as a B-cell superantigen, causing polyclonal B-cell activation and the production of a wide array of low-affinity antibodies, some of which incidentally cross-react with gliadin peptides.\n\nB. The covalent linkage by mTP alters the three-dimensional structure of the gliadin peptide, creating a novel T-cell epitope that binds to HLA-DQ2 with exceptionally high affinity, independent of any deamidation. The bacterial protein component of the conjugate is not directly involved in the T-cell activation step.\n\nC. The gliadin-bacterial protein conjugate is taken up by an APC. The bacterial protein component provides a \"danger signal\" by activating TLR2, leading to APC maturation and the upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules. The attached gliadin peptide is then processed and presented on HLA-DQ2 molecules, leading to the robust activation of naive gliadin-specific $CD4^+$ T-cells that would otherwise have remained unresponsive.\n\nD. The large conjugate complex is directly cytotoxic to intestinal epithelial cells, causing widespread cell death. This releases large amounts of endogenous human tTG from the damaged tissue, which then deamidates free gliadin peptides, initiating the canonical disease pathway.\n\nE. The bacterial protein part of the conjugate is highly immunogenic and elicits a strong T-cell response. Due to molecular mimicry, these T-cells, originally activated by the bacterial protein, cross-react with structurally similar, unmodified gliadin peptides presented by local APCs.", "solution": "1) Identify the necessary conditions for naive $CD4^+$ T-cell priming. Fundamental T-cell activation requires: (i) antigen-specific signal 1, namely TCR recognition of a peptide bound to MHC class II on an antigen-presenting cell (APC), denoted conceptually as $TCR \\to pMHCII$; and (ii) a co-stimulatory signal 2 provided by mature APCs, typically via CD80/CD86 engaging CD28, which is upregulated downstream of pattern-recognition receptor signaling. In the gut, presentation of food-derived peptides without danger signals tends to induce anergy or regulatory T-cell responses rather than robust effector priming.\n\n2) Map the scenario to signal 1. The gliadin component of the conjugate provides the peptide antigen that, upon uptake and processing by an APC, can be loaded onto HLA-DQ2 (an MHC class II molecule). Although deamidation by tissue transglutaminase increases HLA-DQ2 affinity for certain gliadin peptides, initial priming can still occur if some processed peptides bind with sufficient affinity, and inflammation can enhance antigen processing and peptide loading. Therefore, the conjugate can supply signal 1 by yielding gliadin-derived peptides presented on HLA-DQ2 to gliadin-specific $CD4^+$ T cells.\n\n3) Map the scenario to signal 2. The bacterial protein covalently attached to gliadin is a potent TLR2 agonist. TLR2 engagement on APCs signals via MyD88-dependent pathways to activate NF-$\\kappa$B and related transcriptional programs, driving APC maturation with upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86, CD40) and cytokines (for example, IL-12, IL-6, $IL-1\\beta$). This provides signal 2 necessary to avert anergy and to prime naive gliadin-specific $CD4^+$ T cells toward effector differentiation.\n\n4) Establish linked delivery of signals 1 and 2. Because the gliadin peptide is covalently linked to the TLR2-agonist bacterial protein, uptake of the conjugate by an APC couples the delivery of the relevant antigen (gliadin) with a concurrent danger signal (TLR2 activation) to the same APC at the same time. This co-delivery is precisely what is required to convert a typically tolerogenic food antigen into an immunogenic one, thereby offering a plausible mechanism for the initial break in tolerance.\n\n5) Evaluate alternative explanations against immunological principles:\n- Option A (B-cell superantigen) does not explain initial activation of gliadin-specific $CD4^+$ T-cell driven celiac response. Polyclonal B-cell activation and incidental cross-reactivity are neither sufficient nor necessary to initiate the canonical $CD4^+$ T-cell driven celiac response.\n- Option B (novel high-affinity HLA-DQ2 epitope independent of deamidation) ignores the indispensable need for co-stimulation. High MHC affinity alone does not prime naive T cells in the absence of a danger signal; thus, this is incomplete and less plausible given the provided TLR2 agonism.\n- Option D (direct cytotoxicity leading to tTG release) is speculative and not required for initial priming; moreover, the scenario explicitly provides a strong innate stimulus (TLR2) that more parsimoniously explains APC maturation without invoking non-evidenced cytotoxicity.\n- Option E (molecular mimicry) requires sequence/structural homology between bacterial protein peptides and gliadin presented by HLA-DQ2; this is unsubstantiated and unnecessary given the conjugate’s built-in mechanism to ensure both antigen presentation and co-stimulation for gliadin-specific T cells.\n\n6) Conclusion. The most complete and immunologically plausible pathway is that the gliadin-bacterial protein conjugate is internalized by APCs; the bacterial moiety activates TLR2 to mature the APC and upregulate co-stimulatory molecules (signal 2), while the gliadin portion is processed and presented on HLA-DQ2 (signal 1), together driving robust priming of naive gliadin-specific $CD4^+$ T cells.
