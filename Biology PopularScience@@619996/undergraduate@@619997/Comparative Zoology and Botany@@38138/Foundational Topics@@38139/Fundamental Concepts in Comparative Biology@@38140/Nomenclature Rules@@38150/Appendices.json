She decides to name it in honor of her distinguished colleague, Professor Klaus Richter, a renowned expert in alpine botany. In her draft manuscript, she proposes the name *Primula richteri*. However, before submission to a taxonomic journal, the name must be standardized according to the rules set forth by the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN).\n\nYou are given the following set of simplified ICN rules for forming specific epithets from personal names:\n\n*   **Rule I:** To form an epithet honoring a person (male or female), a genitive (possessive) ending is added to the person's name. The name is treated as if it were a Latin second-declension noun.\n*   **Rule II:** For a personal name ending in a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), `-y`, or `-er`, the genitive singular ending is `-i`.\n*   **Rule III:** For a personal name ending in a consonant (except `-er`), the genitive singular ending is `-ii`.\n*   **Rule IV:** To honor two or more men (or a mixed-gender group) with the same surname, the genitive plural ending `-orum` is used. To honor two or more women with the same surname, the genitive plural ending `-arum` is used.\n\nBased strictly on the rules provided, which of the following represents the correctly formed specific epithet to honor Professor Klaus Richter?\n\nA. richteri\nB. richterii\nC. richterorum\nD. richterae\nE. richter", "solution": "We want to form a specific epithet to honor a single person, Professor Klaus Richter, following the provided ICN-style rules.\n\nBy Rule I, the epithet must be a genitive (possessive) form of the person’s name, treated as if it were a Latin second-declension noun.\n\nBy Rule II, if the personal name ends in a vowel, y, or er, the genitive singular ending is -i. The surname \"Richter\" ends with -er, so Rule II applies.\n\nTherefore, we form the genitive singular by adding -i to the surname, yielding \"richteri.\"\n\nWe do not use -ii (Rule III) because the name ends in -er, and -ii is reserved for names ending in consonants other than -er. We do not use -orum or -arum (Rule IV) because only one person is being honored.

They are focusing on the type genus *Actias*, a name derived from Greek and treated as a third-declension feminine noun in Latin. According to the principles of biological nomenclature, family-group names (which include Tribe and Subfamily) are formed from the stem of a designated type genus. However, there are different codes of nomenclature for different kingdoms of life. The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) governs botanical and mycological names, while the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) governs animal names.\n\nThe taxonomist must first determine the correct governing code and then apply its rules to form the names for the Tribe and Subfamily that contain the genus *Actias*.

Family-group names in zoology are formed from the stem of the type genus (ICZN Art. 29). For a Latinized third-declension noun, the stem is obtained from the genitive singular.

This stability is anchored by physical \"type specimens,\" with the \"holotype\" being the single individual upon which a species description is based. This thought experiment [@problem_id:1758806] explores a classic nomenclatural dilemma: what happens when a long-lost holotype is rediscovered after a replacement \"neotype\" has been formally established, revealing the robust, logical framework the ICZN uses to resolve such conflicts.", "problem": "In 1895, the renowned entomologist Dr. Alistair Finch described a new species of stag beetle from Borneo, which he named *Cyclommatus magnificus*. He designated a single male specimen as the holotype and deposited it in the Royal Museum of Natural History. Tragically, a fire in the museum's entomology wing in 1941 was believed to have destroyed this and many other type specimens.\n\nFor decades, the taxonomic identity of *C. magnificus* became uncertain due to the lack of a name-bearing type and the ambiguity of Finch's original description. To stabilize the nomenclature, Dr. Eleanor Vance, a leading expert on stag beetles, conducted a thorough review. In 1980, after demonstrating that the holotype was indeed lost and that a new name-bearing type was required for taxonomic stability, she validly designated a neotype for *C. magnificus* in a published work, fully satisfying all the qualifying conditions of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). This neotype was widely accepted by the scientific community.\n\nIn 2023, a curator at the Royal Museum, while reorganizing an old, overlooked cabinet of specimens that had been moved to a different building before the fire, discovered Dr. Finch's original 1895 holotype of *C. magnificus*. It was perfectly preserved and clearly labeled in Finch's own handwriting.\n\nAccording to the rules of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, which specimen now serves as the single name-bearing type for the species *Cyclommatus magnificus*?\n\nA. The rediscovered 1895 holotype.\nB. The 1980 neotype, as it was validly designated and its use is established.\nC. Both the holotype and the neotype are now considered syntypes.\nD. Neither specimen; the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature must rule to designate one of them.\nE. The specimen that is in better physical condition, to best serve as a scientific reference.", "solution": "A holotype is the original name-bearing type fixed in the original description; it remains the primary standard of reference for the species-group name. A neotype is a replacement name-bearing type that may be designated when, and only when, the original name-bearing type material is demonstrably lost or destroyed and a name-bearing type is needed to fix the application of the name; such a designation must meet the qualifying conditions of the ICZN (Article 75.3).\n\nIn 1980, the conditions for neotype designation were met, so the neotype validly served as the name-bearing type from that time. However, the ICZN explicitly addresses the subsequent discovery of original name-bearing type material after a neotype has been designated. Under Article 75.8 (invalidation of a neotype upon discovery of the original name-bearing type), if a holotype, lectotype, or syntypes are later found, the neotype is set aside and the rediscovered original name-bearing type again becomes the single name-bearing type, unless the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature uses its plenary power to conserve the neotype to maintain prevailing usage. In the absence of such a Commission ruling, the rediscovered original name-bearing type takes precedence.\n\nApplying these principles: the 1895 holotype has been rediscovered and is clearly identifiable. Therefore, under Article 75.8, the 1980 neotype is set aside, and the rediscovered 1895 holotype is restored as the single name-bearing type for Cyclommatus magnificus. Consequently, option A is correct; options B, C, D, and E contradict the Code’s provisions absent an explicit Commission ruling to conserve the neotype.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1758806"}]}
