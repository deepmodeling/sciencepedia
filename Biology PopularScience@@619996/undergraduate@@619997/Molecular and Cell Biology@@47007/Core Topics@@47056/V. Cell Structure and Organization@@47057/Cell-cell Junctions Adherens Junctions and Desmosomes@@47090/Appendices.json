This first exercise explores the most fundamental requirement for this adhesion. By considering the effect of removing extracellular calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$), you will reinforce your understanding of the direct link between environmental chemistry and the structural integrity of cadherin-based junctions [@problem_id:2308104].", "problem": "Epithelial cells form cohesive sheets, in part, by establishing strong cell-cell connections through specialized structures known as adherens junctions and desmosomes. The primary adhesion molecules mediating these connections are members of the cadherin protein family. Consider a healthy, confluent monolayer of epithelial cells grown in a culture dish with a standard growth medium. This monolayer is then treated with a solution containing ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), a well-known chelating agent that specifically binds to and removes free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the extracellular environment.\n\nBased on your understanding of the molecular architecture of adherens junctions and desmosomes, what is the most direct and immediate molecular consequence of treating this epithelial monolayer with EGTA?\n\nA. The intracellular plaque proteins (catenins and desmoplakin) will detach from the actin and intermediate filaments, respectively.\n\nB. The extracellular domains of the cadherin proteins will undergo a conformational change, disrupting their ability to bind to cadherins on adjacent cells.\n\nC. ATP-dependent transport mechanisms will be inhibited, preventing the delivery of new cadherin molecules to the cell surface.\n\nD. The chelating agent will cross the plasma membrane and cause the denaturation of the intracellular domains of the cadherin proteins.\n\nE. The cells will immediately initiate apoptosis (programmed cell death) as a result of losing contact-dependent survival signals.", "solution": "Adherens junctions are mediated by classical cadherins (e.g., E-cadherin) that connect to actin via catenins, and desmosomes are mediated by desmogleins and desmocollins (desmosomal cadherins) that connect to intermediate filaments via plakoglobin and desmoplakin. A defining biochemical property of all cadherins is their strict dependence on extracellular calcium ions: multiple $Ca^{2+}$ ions bind at the linker regions between extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats, conferring a rigid, extended conformation that is required for both cis clustering and trans homophilic binding to cadherins on adjacent cells.\n\nEGTA is an extracellular chelator with high affinity for $Ca^{2+}$. Upon addition to the medium, EGTA rapidly lowers free extracellular $Ca^{2+}$ concentration, leading to dissociation of $Ca^{2+}$ from the extracellular domains of cadherins. The immediate molecular consequence is a conformational change of the cadherin ectodomains from a rigid, adhesive state to a flexible, non-adhesive state, which disrupts trans cadherin-cadherin interactions at cell-cell contacts.\n\nBy contrast, the intracellular plaque attachments (catenins to actin; desmoplakin to intermediate filaments) do not directly depend on extracellular $Ca^{2+}$ and are not the most immediate targets of EGTA (ruling out A). EGTA does not inhibit ATP-dependent trafficking mechanisms (ruling out C), is not membrane permeant and does not denature intracellular cadherin domains (ruling out D), and loss of adhesion can lead to signaling changes and potential anoikis, but apoptosis is not the most direct and immediate molecular event upon acute $Ca^{2+}$ chelation (ruling out E). Therefore, the most direct and immediate molecular consequence is the loss of $Ca^{2+}$-dependent cadherin ectodomain conformation and trans binding.\n\nHence, the correct option is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2308104"}, {"introduction": "While both adherens junctions and desmosomes use members of the cadherin superfamily to link cells, they serve distinct roles. This problem presents a hypothetical scenario to highlight the specialized function of desmosomes in providing mechanical resilience. By comparing a normal epithelial sheet with one lacking desmosomes, you can deduce the unique contribution of these junctions to tissue strength against physical stress [@problem_id:2308059].", "problem": "A team of cell biologists is studying the mechanical properties of epithelial tissues. They culture two types of epithelial cells on separate culture plates until they form confluent monolayers (a single, continuous layer of cells).\n\n- The first cell type is a wild-type (WT) line, which forms all normal cell-cell junctions.\n- The second cell type is a genetically modified mutant (MT) line. These cells are specifically engineered to be unable to produce desmoglein and desmocollin, key proteins required for the formation of desmosomes. However, their ability to form other junctions, particularly adherens junctions, is completely normal.\n\nBoth monolayers are then subjected to an identical experiment: a controlled, high-velocity fluid flow is passed over their surface to apply a significant shearing force. Based on your understanding of the functions of cell-cell junctions, which of the following outcomes is the most likely to be observed?\n\nA. The MT monolayer will be significantly more fragile and will break apart, with cells separating from each other, while the WT monolayer remains largely intact.\n\nB. Both the WT and MT monolayers will demonstrate comparable resistance to the shearing force, as the presence of adherens junctions is sufficient for mechanical integrity.\n\nC. The MT monolayer will be more resistant to the shearing force than the WT monolayer, as the lack of rigid desmosomes allows the layer to deform more easily without breaking.\n\nD. The MT cells will be unable to form a confluent monolayer in the first place, as desmosomes are essential for the initial establishment of cell-cell contacts.", "solution": "The mechanical integrity of epithelial monolayers arises from complementary cell-cell junctions that couple the cytoskeletons of neighboring cells.\n\nStep 1: Define the relevant junctions and their cytoskeletal linkages.\n- Adherens junctions are mediated by classical cadherins (e.g., E-cadherin) that connect to the actin cytoskeleton via catenins. They are crucial for the initiation of cell-cell adhesion, maintenance of cell shape, and transmission of tensile forces across cells.\n- Desmosomes are mediated by desmoglein and desmocollin (desmosomal cadherins) that connect to intermediate filaments (e.g., keratins) via plakoglobin and desmoplakin. They provide robust mechanical coupling and confer high resistance to shear and stretch, especially in mechanically stressed epithelia (e.g., skin, heart).\n\nStep 2: Identify the engineered defect and its direct consequence.\n- The mutant cells lack desmoglein and desmocollin, so they cannot form desmosomes, but retain normal adherens junctions. Therefore, they can still establish initial cell-cell adhesion and confluence through adherens junctions. This rules out the assertion that desmosomes are essential for the initial establishment of contacts; thus, option D is inconsistent with the known role of adherens junctions in initiating adhesion.\n\nStep 3: Predict the response to high shearing force based on mechanics of junction-cytoskeleton coupling.\n- Shear forces require strong intercellular anchoring that can distribute stress across the tissue. Desmosomes, by linking intermediate filament networks between cells, form a rugged, stress-dissipating lattice that is particularly effective against shear and stretch. Without desmosomes, the mechanical load must be borne predominantly by adherens junctions and the actin cytoskeleton, which are less effective in resisting high shear and more prone to failure under such conditions. Therefore, the mutant monolayer will exhibit decreased mechanical integrity and is more likely to rupture or have cells separate under shear, while the wild-type monolayer with intact desmosomes is expected to remain comparatively intact.\n\nStep 4: Exclude alternatives based on known pathophysiology and mechanics.\n- Option B is unlikely because adherens junctions alone generally do not provide the same resistance to high mechanical stress as the combined adherens-desmosome network; clinical correlates (e.g., desmosomal protein defects) show tissue fragility.\n- Option C is incorrect because increased deformability due to loss of rigid desmosomal coupling does not translate to increased resistance; rather, it reflects a weakened load-bearing network unable to distribute shear effectively.\n\nThus, the most likely outcome is that the mutant monolayer is significantly more fragile under shear, whereas the wild-type remains largely intact.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2308059"}, {"introduction": "The remarkable specificity of cellular interactions is rooted in the modular design of proteins like cadherins. This advanced problem challenges you to predict the outcome of a genetic engineering experiment that creates a chimeric cadherin. Analyzing this scenario will test your integrated understanding of how a protein's extracellular domain governs binding partners, while its cytoplasmic tail dictates the internal cytoskeletal connection [@problem_id:2308072].", "problem": "In a cell biology research project, a team of scientists has engineered a line of human epithelial cells, which are known to naturally possess a full complement of proteins for both adherens junctions and desmosomes. The genetic modification causes these cells to express a novel chimeric cadherin protein, which we will call \"Cad-X\". The structure of Cad-X consists of the complete extracellular domain of human N-cadherin fused to the complete cytoplasmic tail of human desmoglein-1. All necessary intracellular adaptor proteins (e.g., alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, plakoglobin, plakophilins, desmoplakin) and cytoskeletal filaments (actin and intermediate filaments) are expressed at normal levels in these engineered cells.\n\nThese engineered cells expressing Cad-X are then placed into a co-culture system with primary neurons, which are known to express N-cadherin as their primary cell-cell adhesion molecule but do not form desmosomes. Assuming the Cad-X protein is properly folded, trafficked to the cell membrane, and is functional, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the dominant junctional phenotype that will be observed between the engineered epithelial cells and the primary neurons?\n\nA. Stable junctions will form between the cell types, and these junctions will be linked intracellularly to the intermediate filament network of the engineered cell.\n\nB. Stable junctions will form between the cell types, and these junctions will be linked intracellularly to the actin cytoskeleton of the engineered cell.\n\nC. The engineered cells and neurons will fail to form any stable junctions because the chimeric nature of Cad-X disrupts its adhesive function.\n\nD. Stable junctions will form between the cell types, but these junctions will lack any connection to the cytoskeleton in the engineered cell due to conflicting signals from the hybrid protein.\n\nE. The engineered cells will not form junctions with the neurons but will form strong junctions with each other, which are linked to the intermediate filament network.", "solution": "The key principles are as follows.\n\nFirst, classical cadherins such as N-cadherin mediate cell-cell adhesion through largely homophilic binding via their extracellular domains. Therefore, the ability of two cells to adhere through cadherins is determined primarily by the extracellular domain present on each cell’s surface. In this scenario, the engineered epithelial cells present Cad-X with the complete extracellular domain of human N-cadherin, while the primary neurons express native N-cadherin. Consequently, homophilic N-cadherin interactions between the two cell types are expected to produce stable trans adhesion, provided the protein is properly folded and at the membrane, as stated.\n\nSecond, the cytoskeletal linkage and plaque composition on the inside of the engineered epithelial cell are dictated by the cytoplasmic tail of the cadherin present on that cell. Desmosomal cadherins (desmogleins and desmocollins) recruit plakoglobin and plakophilins, which in turn recruit desmoplakin to link the junction to intermediate filaments. In contrast, classical cadherins such as N-cadherin recruit catenins (beta-catenin, alpha-catenin, p120-catenin) to link to the actin cytoskeleton. In the chimera Cad-X, the cytoplasmic tail is from desmoglein-1; thus, within the engineered epithelial cell, the intracellular plaque will be desmosome-like and will link to intermediate filaments via desmoplakin, given that all desmosomal adaptors and intermediate filaments are present at normal levels, as specified.\n\nThird, the identity of the trans-binding partner on the neuron side does not prevent the engineered epithelial cell from assembling the plaque dictated by its own cytoplasmic tail. Thus, although the neuron will assemble an actin-linked classical cadherin complex on its side, the engineered epithelial cell will assemble an intermediate filament-linked desmosomal plaque on its side. The extracellular adhesion remains stable due to the N-cadherin–N-cadherin homophilic interaction.\n\nTherefore, stable junctions will form between the engineered epithelial cells and neurons, and on the engineered epithelial cell side, these junctions will be linked to the intermediate filament network.\n\nEliminating alternatives:\n- Option B is incompatible because an actin linkage requires a classical cadherin cytoplasmic tail, which is absent in Cad-X.\n- Option C contradicts the assumption that Cad-X is properly folded and functional and ignores the homophilic N-cadherin extracellular interaction.\n- Option D is incorrect because the cytoplasmic tail provides a clear, not conflicting, intracellular recruitment program, leading to intermediate filament linkage.\n- Option E is incorrect because the N-cadherin extracellular domain enables adhesion to neurons; thus, junctions with neurons will form, not fail.\n\nThe most accurate prediction is that stable junctions form and are linked intracellularly to intermediate filaments in the engineered epithelial cell.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2308072"}]}
