The system is based on two engineered proteins, which we will call Protein Alpha and Protein Beta. Protein Alpha is a multivalent 'scaffold' protein containing exactly three binding domains for Protein Beta. Similarly, Protein Beta is a multivalent 'linker' protein that also contains exactly three binding domains for Protein Alpha. The interaction between these domains is specific and drives the co-assembly of the proteins.\n\nInitial experiments show that when the two proteins are co-expressed at an equimolar ratio (1:1), they robustly undergo phase separation, forming large, spherical condensates visible by microscopy. To investigate the importance of stoichiometry, the researcher creates two new experimental conditions. In Condition 1, the molar ratio of Protein Alpha to Protein Beta is drastically skewed to 20:1. In Condition 2, the molar ratio is skewed to 1:20.\n\nAssuming the total concentration of all proteins (Alpha + Beta) is kept constant and is above the critical concentration for phase separation in the 1:1 case, what is the most likely outcome for condensate formation in both Condition 1 and Condition 2, compared to the original 1:1 experiment?\n\nA. In both conditions, the condensates will be significantly larger and more stable.\n\nB. In Condition 1, condensates will form, but in Condition 2, they will be completely dissolved.\n\nC.

This precludes percolation and severely inhibits condensate formation, yielding either much smaller finite oligomers or a dissolved state, despite the same total protein concentration that supports phase separation at $1:1$.\n\nConsequently, the most likely outcome in both Condition 1 and Condition 2 is severe inhibition of large condensate formation.\n\nThe correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2306440"}, {"introduction": "Having established the importance of forming a network, we now turn to quantifying how a protein's molecular features influence its tendency to phase separate.
