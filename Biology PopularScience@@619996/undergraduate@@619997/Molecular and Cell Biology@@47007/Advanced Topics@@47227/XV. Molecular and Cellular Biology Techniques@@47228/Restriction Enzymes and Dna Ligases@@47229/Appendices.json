This exercise challenges you to think like an experimentalist by contrasting a perfect digest with a more realistic partial digest. Understanding the different DNA species generated in a partial reaction is a fundamental skill for correctly interpreting agarose gel results and diagnosing experimental issues [@problem_id:2335953].", "problem": "A molecular biology student is working with a circular plasmid designated pBIO-X, which has a total length of 8000 base pairs (bp). This plasmid contains exactly two recognition sites for the restriction enzyme *EcoRV*, located at nucleotide positions 2500 and 6000. The student performs two separate digestion experiments.\n\n- **Reaction A**: The plasmid is subjected to a **complete digestion** with *EcoRV*, allowing the reaction to proceed until all possible recognition sites on every plasmid molecule have been cleaved.\n- **Reaction B**: The plasmid is subjected to a **partial digestion** with *EcoRV*. The reaction is stopped prematurely, resulting in a mixture of molecules, including uncut plasmids, plasmids cleaved at only one of the two sites, and plasmids cleaved at both sites.\n\nThe products of both reactions are then analyzed by running them in separate lanes on an agarose gel. It is known that uncut circular plasmids in their native, supercoiled state migrate faster through the gel than linear DNA fragments of the same total base pair length.\n\nWhich of the following choices correctly identifies a band that would be observed on the gel for the partial digest (Reaction B) but would be **absent** from the gel for the complete digest (Reaction A)?\n\nA. A band corresponding to a linear DNA fragment of 4500 bp.\n\nB. A band that migrates faster than a linear 8000 bp fragment, corresponding to the fully digested products.\n\nC.

For a circular DNA cut at two sites, a complete digest yields two linear fragments whose lengths are the two arc distances between the sites:\n$$\nd_{1}=|s_{2}-s_{1}|=6000-2500=3500,\\quad d_{2}=L-d_{1}=8000-3500=4500.\n$$\nThus, Reaction A (complete digest) produces only linear fragments of $3500$ bp and $4500$ bp.\n\nReaction B (partial digest) yields a mixture:\n- Uncut, supercoiled circular plasmid of total length $L=8000$ bp, which migrates faster than a linear $8000$ bp fragment.\n- Singly cut molecules, which are linearized full-length plasmids of $L=8000$ bp.\n- Doubly cut molecules, which are the same $3500$ bp and $4500$ bp fragments as in Reaction A.\n\nComparing bands:\n- The $3500$ bp (option C) and $4500$ bp (option A) bands appear in both reactions, so they are not unique to Reaction B.\n- A $2500$ bp band (option E) is not produced by the given cut positions.\n- A band migrating faster than a linear $8000$ bp fragment does appear in Reaction B due to uncut supercoiled plasmid, but the option’s description incorrectly attributes it to fully digested products, which is false; fully digested products are $3500$ bp and $4500$ bp linear fragments. Hence option B is not correct as stated.\n- A linear $8000$ bp band (option D) arises from single-site cleavage in the partial digest and is absent from the complete digest.\n\nTherefore, the band present in Reaction B but absent in Reaction A is the linear $8000$ bp fragment.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2335953"}, {"introduction": "Moving from interpreting a single experiment to synthesizing data from several, this practice introduces the logical puzzle of restriction mapping. By using the fragment sizes from single and double digests, you can deduce the arrangement of restriction sites on a plasmid, much like solving a puzzle. This analytical technique is essential for verifying the structure of plasmids and was a cornerstone of molecular genetics before the widespread use of sequencing [@problem_id:2335939].", "problem": "A molecular biologist is characterizing a newly constructed circular plasmid, designated pXYZ, which has a total size of 10.0 kilobase pairs (kb). To create a restriction map, the plasmid is subjected to a series of digestions using the restriction enzymes EcoRI and BamHI. The resulting DNA fragments are separated by gel electrophoresis and their sizes are determined.\n\nThe experimental results are as follows:\n1.  Digestion of pXYZ with EcoRI alone yields two fragments of sizes 7.0 kb and 3.0 kb.\n2.  Digestion of pXYZ with BamHI alone also yields two fragments, with sizes of 6.5 kb and 3.5 kb.\n3.  When pXYZ is digested with both EcoRI and BamHI simultaneously, four fragments are produced with sizes 4.0 kb, 3.0 kb, 2.5 kb, and 0.5 kb.\n\nBased on these results, determine the shortest distance along the plasmid backbone between the two BamHI restriction sites. Express your answer in kb, rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "Let the circular plasmid have total length $L=10.0$ kb. A single digest with EcoRI gives two fragments of $7.0$ kb and $3.0$ kb, so there are two EcoRI sites partitioning the circle into arcs of lengths $7.0$ and $3.0$. A single digest with BamHI gives two fragments of $6.5$ kb and $3.5$ kb, so there are two BamHI sites partitioning the circle into arcs of lengths $6.5$ and $3.5$. A double digest with EcoRI and BamHI yields four fragments of lengths $4.0$ kb, $3.0$ kb, $2.5$ kb, and $0.5$ kb; these are the consecutive segment lengths between adjacent restriction sites around the circle.\n\nDenote the four double-digest segment lengths as the multiset $\\{0.5,2.5,3.0,4.0\\}$, arranged in some cyclic order $(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},x_{4})$ around the plasmid. Each single-digest fragment length must equal the sum of two consecutive double-digest segments, because the single-enzyme cut removes the intervening cuts of the other enzyme and merges adjacent segments.\n\nFor EcoRI, the two single-digest arcs are $7.0$ and $3.0$. Among the given segment lengths, the only way to obtain $3.0$ as a sum of consecutive segments is $0.5+2.5=3.0$. Therefore $0.5$ and $2.5$ must be adjacent and constitute one EcoRI arc, and the remaining two segments $4.0$ and $3.0$ must be adjacent and constitute the other EcoRI arc $4.0+3.0=7.0$.\n\nFor BamHI, the two single-digest arcs are $6.5$ and $3.5$. The only way to obtain $3.5$ as a sum of consecutive segments is $3.0+0.5=3.5$. Therefore $3.0$ and $0.5$ must be adjacent and constitute one BamHI arc, and the remaining two segments $2.5$ and $4.0$ must be adjacent and constitute the other BamHI arc $2.5+4.0=6.5$.\n\nCombining these adjacency constraints, a cyclic order that satisfies both is $0.5-2.5-4.0-3.0$ (unique up to rotation and reversal). In this arrangement, the BamHI sites lie at the boundaries between the BamHI arcs, i.e., between $0.5$ and $2.5$ and between $4.0$ and $3.0$. The two arcs between the BamHI sites then have lengths $2.5+4.0=6.5$ and $3.0+0.5=3.5$. The shortest distance along the plasmid backbone between the two BamHI sites is therefore $3.5$ kb. Rounded to two significant figures, this is $3.5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.5}$$", "id": "2335939"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal of learning about restriction enzymes and ligases is often to build new DNA constructs. This final practice places you in the role of a molecular engineer designing a cloning strategy.

Gene-Y spans $950$ to $2350$, which lies entirely between $800$ and $2500$, hence the $1700$ bp EcoRI–HindIII fragment contains the complete, intact Gene-Y.\n\nLigation that yields a single circular plasmid containing both the ampicillin resistance gene (from the $2950$ bp pVEC fragment) and the intact Gene-Y (from the $1700$ bp pGENE fragment) will join these two EcoRI–HindIII fragments.
