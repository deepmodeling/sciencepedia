Consider a naive T cell requiring two signals for activation: antigen recognition by the T cell receptor (TCR) and co-stimulation via Cluster of Differentiation 28 (CD28). The integrated antigen-derived signal across $N$ microclusters is modeled as a weighted sum $S$ given by $S=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i s_i$, where $w_i$ encodes the biochemical efficacy of peptide-major histocompatibility complex microcluster $i$ and $s_i$ encodes its occupancy-dwell contribution.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis begins with the formal definition of the system. The integrated signal from $N$ microclusters is given by $S$. In the absence of co-stimulation, T cell activation requires this signal to exceed a fixed threshold $\\theta_0$, leading to the condition:\n$$S > \\theta_0$$\nCo-stimulation introduces two effects, a multiplicative gain $g$ and an additive bias $b$, which transform the integrated signal $S$ into an effective quantity $J$. The problem describes this as an affine transformation, which is mathematically expressed as:\n$$J = gS + b$$\nThe problem states that the downstream decision machinery remains unchanged, meaning it compares this new effective signal $J$ against the original threshold $\\theta_0$. Thus, the activation condition with co-stimulation is:\n$$J > \\theta_0$$\nTo find the equivalent threshold $\\theta_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ in terms of the original signal $S$, we must rearrange this inequality into the form $S > \\theta_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. We substitute the expression for $J$ into the activation condition:\n$$gS + b > \\theta_0$$\nWe proceed to solve this inequality for $S$. First, subtract the additive bias $b$ from both sides:\n$$gS > \\theta_0 - b$$\nNext, we must divide by the gain factor $g$. The problem specifies that $g > 1$, which means $g$ is a positive number. Therefore, dividing the inequality by $g$ does not change the direction of the inequality sign:\n$$S > \\frac{\\theta_0 - b}{g}$$\nThis expression is now in the desired canonical form, $S > \\theta_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. By direct comparison, we identify the equivalent threshold $\\theta_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ as:\n$$\\theta_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\theta_0 - b}{g}$$\nThis expression provides the effective activation threshold for the antigen-derived signal $S$ in the presence of co-stimulation. A lower value of $\\theta_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ compared to $\\theta_0$ signifies that co-stimulation makes the T cell more sensitive to the antigen, requiring a smaller antigenic signal to trigger activation.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $\\theta_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ using the provided parameters: $\\theta_0 = 2.0$, $g = 1.3$, and $b = 0.15$. All values are dimensionless, as is appropriate for this type of signal transduction model.\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula for $\\theta_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\\theta_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{2.0 - 0.15}{1.3}$$\nFirst, compute the numerator:\n$$2.0 - 0.15 = 1.85$$\nThen, perform the division:\n$$\\theta_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{1.85}{1.3} \\approx 1.4230769...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant digits are $1$, $4$, $2$, and $3$. The fifth digit is $0$, so we round down.\n$$\\theta_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 1.423$$\nThe result $\\theta_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 1.423$ is less than $\\theta_0 = 2.0$.
