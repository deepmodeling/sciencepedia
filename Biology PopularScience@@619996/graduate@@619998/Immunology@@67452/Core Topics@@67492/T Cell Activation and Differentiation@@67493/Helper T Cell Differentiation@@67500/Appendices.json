The scenario describes Th17 cell differentiation, a standard topic in immunology. The use of a log-normal distribution to model molecular concentrations arising from multiplicative processes is a common and valid approach in systems biology.

This is written as:\n$$ F = P(X > \\theta) $$\nWe are given that $X$ is a log-normally distributed random variable. This means that its natural logarithm, $Y = \\ln X$, is a normally distributed random variable, with $Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^{2})$.\n\nBecause the natural logarithm function is a strictly monotonically increasing function, the inequality $X > \\theta$ is equivalent to the inequality $\\ln X > \\ln \\theta$. Therefore, we can express the fraction $F$ in terms of the normally distributed variable $Y$:\n$$ F = P(\\ln X > \\ln \\theta) = P(Y > \\ln \\theta) $$\nTo find this probability, we must standardize the normal random variable $Y$. A standard normal random variable, denoted $Z$, is defined by the transformation $Z = \\frac{Y - \\mu}{\\sigma}$, where $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. We apply this transformation to our inequality:\n$$ Y > \\ln \\theta \\implies Y - \\mu > \\ln \\theta - \\mu \\implies \\frac{Y - \\mu}{\\sigma} > \\frac{\\ln \\theta - \\mu}{\\sigma} $$\nThus, the probability $F$ can be expressed in terms of the standard normal variable $Z$:\n$$ F = P\\left(Z > \\frac{\\ln \\theta - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) $$\nThe cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution is denoted by $\\Phi(z) = P(Z \\le z)$. The probability of the right tail, $P(Z > z)$, is given by $1 - P(Z \\le z)$, which is $1 - \\Phi(z)$.\nSubstituting this into our expression for $F$, we arrive at the general analytic expression for the fraction of committed cells:\n$$ F = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\ln \\theta - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) $$\nThis expression for $F$ is in terms of the required parameters $\\mu$, $\\sigma$, and $\\theta$.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression using the given numerical values: $\\mu=1$, $\\sigma=0.5$, and $\\theta=1.2$.\nFirst, we compute the argument of the CDF:\n$$ z_0 = \\frac{\\ln(\\theta) - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{\\ln(1.2) - 1}{0.5} $$\nUsing the value $\\ln(1.2) \\approx 0.18232$, we find:\n$$ z_0 \\approx \\frac{0.18232 - 1}{0.5} = \\frac{-0.81768}{0.5} = -1.63536 $$\nThe fraction $F$ is then:\n$$ F = 1 - \\Phi(-1.63536) $$\nWe use the symmetry property of the standard normal CDF, which states that $\\Phi(-z) = 1 - \\Phi(z)$.
