{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Mastering pedigree analysis begins with the fundamental skill of deducing genotypes from family relationships. This exercise challenges you to apply the principles of autosomal recessive inheritance to a multi-generational family, identifying individuals who must logically carry the disease allele even if they are phenotypically normal. This process of identifying obligate carriers is a cornerstone of genetic counseling and risk assessment [@problem_id:1507959].", "problem": "A genetic counselor is analyzing a family's history for a rare metabolic disorder known to be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The analysis centers on a three-generation family.\n\nThe first generation consists of two founding families. The first family is headed by Charles and Anna. The second family is headed by David and Beth. A key piece of information is that Anna and Beth are sisters. For the purpose of this analysis, assume any individual marrying into this extended family is homozygous for the dominant, non-disease allele, given the rarity of the disorder.\n\nIn the second generation, Anna and Charles have a son, Edward, and a daughter, Helen. Beth and David have one child, a daughter named Fiona. A consanguineous marriage occurs in this generation: Edward and Fiona, who are first cousins, marry each other. Separately, Helen marries an unrelated man named Ian.\n\nIn the third generation, the pedigree's proband is identified. The proband is Grace, the first and only child of Edward and Fiona, who is diagnosed with the metabolic disorder. Meanwhile, Helen and Ian have had two children: a set of phenotypically normal monozygotic twin boys.\n\nBased on this family history, determine the total number of individuals within this three-generation pedigree who are obligate heterozygous carriers of the allele for the metabolic disorder. An obligate carrier is an individual who, based on the pedigree structure, must carry the recessive allele. The pedigree in question consists of all named individuals: Charles, Anna, David, Beth, Edward, Helen, Ian, Fiona, Grace, and the two twin boys.", "solution": "Let's denote the dominant allele for the normal phenotype as $A$ and the recessive allele for the metabolic disorder as $a$. Since the disorder is autosomal recessive, an individual must have the genotype $aa$ to be affected. Heterozygous individuals ($Aa$) are carriers but are phenotypically normal. Homozygous dominant individuals ($AA$) are also phenotypically normal.\n\nThe solution requires systematically determining the genotype of each individual based on the provided family history.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the proband, Grace.\nGrace is in the third generation and is affected by the disorder. She is the proband. Her genotype must therefore be $aa$.\n\nStep 2: Determine the genotypes of Grace's parents, Edward and Fiona.\nGrace ($aa$) inherited one $a$ allele from her father, Edward, and one $a$ allele from her mother, Fiona. Since Edward and Fiona are phenotypically normal (unaffected), they cannot be $aa$. Therefore, both Edward and Fiona must be heterozygous carriers. Their genotype is $Aa$. This identifies our first two obligate carriers.\n- Edward: $Aa$ (Obligate Carrier 1)\n- Fiona: $Aa$ (Obligate Carrier 2)\n\nStep 3: Determine the genotypes of Edward's parents, Charles and Anna.\nEdward ($Aa$) is the son of Charles and Anna. He must have inherited his $a$ allele from one of them. The problem states that Charles married into the family and should be assumed to be homozygous dominant due to the rarity of the disorder. So, Charles's genotype is $AA$. For Edward to be $Aa$, he must have inherited the $a$ allele from his mother, Anna. Therefore, Anna must be a heterozygous carrier.\n- Charles: $AA$\n- Anna: $Aa$ (Obligate Carrier 3)\n\nStep 4: Determine the genotypes of Fiona's parents, David and Beth.\nFiona ($Aa$) is the daughter of David and Beth. She must have inherited her $a$ allele from one of them. David married into the family and is assumed to be homozygous dominant ($AA$). Therefore, Fiona must have inherited the $a$ allele from her mother, Beth. Beth and her sister, Anna, are thus both carriers, which is consistent with them inheriting the allele from one of their parents (in generation zero).\n- David: $AA$\n- Beth: $Aa$ (Obligate Carrier 4)\n\nStep 5: Analyze the remaining individuals in the pedigree.\n- Helen is the daughter of Charles ($AA$) and Anna ($Aa$). The cross is $AA \\times Aa$. Helen has a $1/2$ probability of being $AA$ and a $1/2$ probability of being $Aa$. Since her genotype is not certain, she is a possible carrier, but not an *obligate* carrier.\n- Ian is Helen's husband who married into the family. His genotype is assumed to be $AA$.\n- The monozygotic twin boys are the children of Helen and Ian. Since they are monozygotic, they have the same genotype. Their father Ian is $AA$. Their mother Helen is either $AA$ or $Aa$.\n    - If Helen is $AA$, the twins will be $AA$.\n    - If Helen is $Aa$, the twins have a $1/2$ chance of being $AA$ and a $1/2$ chance of being $Aa$.\n    In either case, it is not certain that they carry the $a$ allele. They are not obligate carriers.\n- Grace has genotype $aa$. She is affected, not a heterozygous carrier.\n\nStep 6: Tally the obligate carriers.\nBased on the deductions above, the individuals who are obligate heterozygous carriers ($Aa$) are:\n1.  Edward (Generation II)\n2.  Fiona (Generation II)\n3.  Anna (Generation I)\n4.  Beth (Generation I)\n\nThe total count of obligate heterozygous carriers in the described pedigree is 4.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "1507959"}, {"introduction": "Pedigree analysis provides a starting point for risk assessment, but modern genetics integrates this with diagnostic testing. This problem [@problem_id:2835812] demonstrates how to formally combine a prior probability of being a carrier, derived from an X-linked pedigree, with the results of an imperfect genetic test.

Express your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $Se$ and $Sp$. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is a standard problem in quantitative genetics that can be solved using fundamental principles of Mendelian inheritance and probability theory. Therefore, a solution is warranted.\n\nThe objective is to compute the posterior probability that the woman, designated $II\\text{-}2$, is a heterozygous carrier of an X-linked recessive allele, given that she has received a positive test result. This is a problem of Bayesian inference, where an initial (prior) probability is updated with new evidence (the test result) to yield a revised (posterior) probability.\n\nLet $C$ be the event that individual $II\\text{-}2$ is a heterozygous carrier. Her genotype would be $X_x$, where $X$ is the wild-type allele and $x$ is the recessive pathogenic allele.\nLet $C^c$ be the complement event, that $II\\text{-}2$ is not a carrier. Her genotype would be $X_X$.\nLet $T^{+}$ be the event that she receives a positive test result.\n\nThe desired quantity is the conditional probability $P(C|T^{+})$. Using Bayes' theorem, this is expressed as:\n$$\nP(C|T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+}|C) \\cdot P(C)}{P(T^{+})}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^{+})$, can be expanded using the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(T^{+}) = P(T^{+}|C) \\cdot P(C) + P(T^{+}|C^c) \\cdot P(C^c)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for Bayes' theorem gives:\n$$\nP(C|T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+}|C) \\cdot P(C)}{P(T^{+}|C) \\cdot P(C) + P(T^{+}|C^c) \\cdot P(C^c)}\n$$\nTo solve this, we must determine three quantities: the prior probability $P(C)$, and the conditional probabilities $P(T^{+}|C)$ and $P(T^{+}|C^c)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the prior probability, $P(C)$, based on the provided family history.\nThe father, $I\\text{-}1$, is unaffected. For an X-linked trait, his genotype must be $XY$.\nThe brother, $II\\text{-}1$, is affected. His genotype must be $xY$.\nA male inherits his Y chromosome from his father and his X chromosome from his mother. Therefore, the brother $II\\text{-}1$ must have inherited the pathogenic allele $x$ from his mother, $I\\text{-}2$.\nGiven the assumption of no de novo mutation, the mother, $I\\text{-}2$, must be a carrier of the pathogenic allele. Since the disorder has negligible penetrance in heterozygous females, her phenotype is not informative, but the genotype of her son proves she is a carrier. Her genotype is thus $Xx$.\n\nThe woman, $II\\text{-}2$, is the daughter of parents with genotypes $I\\text{-}1$ ($XY$) and $I\\text{-}2$ ($Xx$).\nA daughter inherits one X chromosome from her father and one X chromosome from her mother.\nFrom her father ($XY$), she must inherit his only X chromosome, which carries the wild-type allele $X$.\nFrom her mother ($Xx$), she has a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ of inheriting the wild-type allele $X$ and a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ of inheriting the pathogenic allele $x$.\nTherefore, there are two possible genotypes for $II\\text{-}2$:\n1. She inherits $X$ from her mother, resulting in genotype $XX$ (non-carrier). The probability of this is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n2. She inherits $x$ from her mother, resulting in genotype $Xx$ (carrier). The probability of this is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe information that $II\\text{-}2$ is unaffected is consistent with both possibilities, as non-carriers ($XX$) are unaffected by definition, and heterozygous carriers ($Xx$) are unaffected due to negligible penetrance. Thus, this observation does not alter the probabilities.\n\nThe prior probability that $II\\text{-}2$ is a carrier is $P(C) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe prior probability that she is not a carrier is $P(C^c) = 1 - P(C) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSecond, we define the conditional probabilities of the test result based on the provided sensitivity ($Se$) and specificity ($Sp$).\nSensitivity is the probability of a positive test given that the individual is a carrier.\n$$\nP(T^{+}|C) = Se\n$$\nSpecificity is the probability of a negative test given that the individual is not a carrier. Let $T^{-}$ denote a negative test result.\n$$\nP(T^{-}|C^c) = Sp\n$$\nThe probability we need is for a positive test in a non-carrier, $P(T^{+}|C^c)$. Since a test result can only be positive or negative, this is the complement of a negative test for a non-carrier:\n$$\nP(T^{+}|C^c) = 1 - P(T^{-}|C^c) = 1 - Sp\n$$\nThis term represents the false positive rate of the test.\n\nFinally, we substitute all determined values into the Bayesian formula:\n- $P(C) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- $P(C^c) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- $P(T^{+}|C) = Se$\n- $P(T^{+}|C^c) = 1 - Sp$\n\nThe posterior probability is:\n$$\nP(C|T^{+}) = \\frac{(Se) \\cdot (\\frac{1}{2})}{(Se) \\cdot (\\frac{1}{2}) + (1 - Sp) \\cdot (\\frac{1}{2})}\n$$\nThe factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ is common to all terms in the numerator and denominator, and can be cancelled out:\n$$\nP(C|T^{+}) = \\frac{Se}{Se + (1 - Sp)}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the posterior probability that woman $II\\text{-}2$ is a carrier, given a positive test result, in terms of the test's sensitivity and specificity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{Se}{Se + 1 - Sp}}\n$$", "id": "2835812"}, {"introduction": "Beyond tracking a single disease, pedigree analysis is a powerful tool for mapping the location of genes on chromosomes.

Calculating the Logarithm of Odds (LOD) score, with a recombination fraction $\\theta$, will introduce you to the statistical framework that geneticists use to determine if two loci are physically close on the same chromosome.", "problem": "A team of geneticists is investigating a rare genetic disorder known as Flexor Tendon Dysplasia (FTD), which manifests as a progressive stiffening of the hand and finger joints. It has been established that FTD is an autosomal dominant condition. To map the FTD gene, the team analyzes its inheritance pattern alongside a co-dominant molecular marker locus, which has two alleles, M1 and M2.\n\nThe analysis focuses on a specific three-generation family. The key individuals are in Generation I and II:\n- A man in Generation I has FTD. His father (the paternal grandfather) also had FTD and was genotyped as M2/M2 for the marker. His mother (the paternal grandmother) was unaffected and had a marker genotype of M1/M1.

An affected son with marker genotype M1/M1.\n\nThe Logarithm of Odds (LOD) score is a statistical measure used to estimate whether two genetic loci are likely to be located near each other on a chromosome and are therefore genetically linked.
