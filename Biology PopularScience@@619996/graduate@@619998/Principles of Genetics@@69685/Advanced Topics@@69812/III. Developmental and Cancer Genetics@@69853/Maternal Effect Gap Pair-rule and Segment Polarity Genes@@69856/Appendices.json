The degradation is a first-order process with rate constant $\\gamma_X$. All repression terms share a common Hill coefficient $n \\geq 1$.\n\nWe must define the activation functions $A_X(x) \\in [0,1]$ based on the provided biological information and using Hill-type kinetics. The maternal morphogen Bicoid, $B(x)$, is a strictly decreasing function of position $x$, while Caudal, $C(x)$, is strictly increasing.\n1.  Hunchback ($H$) is activated by Bicoid ($B$).

This function correctly yields high $H$ expression in the anterior (high $B(x)$) and low expression in the posterior.\n2.  Knirps ($N$) is activated by Caudal ($C$).

To obtain the specified symmetric dimensionless form, we must assume symmetry in the kinetic parameters:\n$\\beta_H = \\beta_K \\equiv \\beta$, $\\gamma_H = \\gamma_K \\equiv \\gamma$, and $K_{HK} = K_{KH} \\equiv K_0$. These are standard assumptions for creating a canonical \"toggle switch\" model. The system becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dH}{dt} = \\frac{\\beta A^*}{1+\\left(K/K_0\\right)^{n}} - \\gamma H $$\n$$ \\frac{dK}{dt} = \\frac{\\beta A^*}{1+\\left(H/K_0\\right)^{n}} - \\gamma K $$\nWe introduce dimensionless time $\\tau = \\gamma t$ and dimensionless concentrations $h = H/K_0$ and $k = K/K_0$. The derivative transforms as $\\frac{d}{dt} = \\gamma \\frac{d}{d\\tau}$. Substituting these into the first equation:\n$$ \\gamma \\frac{d(K_0 h)}{d\\tau} = \\frac{\\beta A^*}{1+k^n} - \\gamma (K_0 h) $$\n$$ \\gamma K_0 \\frac{dh}{d\\tau} = \\frac{\\beta A^*}{1+k^n} - \\gamma K_0 h $$\nDividing by $\\gamma K_0$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{dh}{d\\tau} = \\frac{\\beta A^*}{\\gamma K_0 (1+k^n)} - h $$\nThe equation for $k$ follows identically. By renaming $\\tau$ back to $t$ and defining the dimensionless production-strength parameter $\\alpha = \\frac{\\beta A^*}{\\gamma K_0}$, we arrive at the target system:\n$$ \\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+k^n} - h, \\qquad \\frac{dk}{dt} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+h^n} - k $$\nThis completes the second part.\n\nFor the third part, we perform a stability analysis of the symmetric fixed point of this dimensionless system. The fixed points $(h^*,k^*)$ are the solutions to $\\frac{dh}{dt}=0$ and $\\frac{dk}{dt}=0$:\n$$ h^* = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+(k^*)^n}, \\qquad k^* = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+(h^*)^n} $$\nDue to the system's symmetry, there exists a symmetric fixed point where $h^*=k^*$. Substituting this into the first equation yields a condition for the symmetric state's concentration:\n$$ h^* = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+(h^*)^n} \\implies h^*(1+(h^*)^n) = \\alpha $$\nFor any $\\alpha > 0$, the function $F(h^*) = h^*+(h^*)^{n+1}$ is strictly increasing for $h^* \\ge 0$, guaranteeing a unique symmetric fixed point exists.\n\nTo determine its stability, we compute the Jacobian matrix $J$ of the system at $(h^*, h^*)$:\n$$ J(h^*,h^*) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial h}(\\frac{\\alpha}{1+k^n}-h) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k}(\\frac{\\alpha}{1+k^n}-h) \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial h}(\\frac{\\alpha}{1+h^n}-k) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k}(\\frac{\\alpha}{1+h^n}-k) \\end{pmatrix}_{(h^*,h^*)} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & \\frac{-\\alpha n (h^*)^{n-1}}{(1+(h^*)^n)^2} \\\\ \\frac{-\\alpha n (h^*)^{n-1}}{(1+(h^*)^n)^2} & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nUsing the fixed point relation $\\alpha = h^*(1+(h^*)^n)$, the off-diagonal element simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{-\\alpha n (h^*)^{n-1}}{(1+(h^*)^n)^2} = \\frac{-h^*(1+(h^*)^n) n (h^*)^{n-1}}{(1+(h^*)^n)^2} = \\frac{-n(h^*)^n}{1+(h^*)^n} $$\nLet $C = \\frac{-n(h^*)^n}{1+(h^*)^n}$. The Jacobian is $J = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & C \\\\ C & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are solutions to $\\det(J-\\lambda I)=0$:\n$$ (-1-\\lambda)^2 - C^2 = 0 \\implies \\lambda = -1 \\pm C $$\nSince $h^*>0$ and $n \\ge 1$, $C$ is negative. Let $C = -|C|$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -1-|C|$ and $\\lambda_2 = -1+|C|$.\nThe fixed point is stable if and only if both eigenvalues are negative. $\\lambda_1$ is always negative. Stability thus requires $\\lambda_2 < 0$, which means $|C| < 1$:\n$$ |C| = \\frac{n(h^*)^n}{1+(h^*)^n} < 1 \\implies n(h^*)^n < 1+(h^*)^n \\implies (n-1)(h^*)^n < 1 $$\nBistability emerges through a pitchfork bifurcation when the symmetric fixed point loses stability. This occurs when an eigenvalue crosses zero. Here, it is when $\\lambda_2=0$, which implies $|C|=1$.\nThis condition for bifurcation, $(n-1)(h^*)^n=1$, can only be met if $n>1$. For $n=1$, the condition is $0<1$, which is always true, so the system is always stable and no bistability occurs. For bistability to be possible, we must have cooperativity $n>1$.\nAt the bifurcation point, the critical concentration $h^*_c$ satisfies:\n$$ (h^*_c)^n = \\frac{1}{n-1} $$\nThis gives $h^*_c = (n-1)^{-1/n}$.\nThe critical parameter value $\\alpha_c(n)$ is the value of $\\alpha$ corresponding to this critical concentration $h^*_c$. Using the fixed point equation:\n$$ \\alpha_c = h^*_c(1 + (h^*_c)^n) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $h^*_c$ and $(h^*_c)^n$:\n$$ \\alpha_c(n) = (n-1)^{-1/n} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n-1}\\right) $$\n$$ \\alpha_c(n) = (n-1)^{-1/n} \\left(\\frac{n-1+1}{n-1}\\right) = (n-1)^{-1/n} \\left(\\frac{n}{n-1}\\right) $$\nCombining the terms with the base $(n-1)$:\n$$ \\alpha_c(n) = \\frac{n}{(n-1)^{1} (n-1)^{1/n}} = \\frac{n}{(n-1)^{1+\\frac{1}{n}}} $$\n$$ \\alpha_c(n) = \\frac{n}{(n-1)^{\\frac{n+1}{n}}} $$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the critical value of $\\alpha$ as a function of $n$ for $n>1$, at which bistability appears.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{n}{(n-1)^{\\frac{n+1}{n}}}}\n$$", "id": "2827467"}]}
