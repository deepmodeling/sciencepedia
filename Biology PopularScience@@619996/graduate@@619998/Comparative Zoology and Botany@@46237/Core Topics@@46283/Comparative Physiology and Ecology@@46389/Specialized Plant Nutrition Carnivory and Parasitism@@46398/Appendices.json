Consider a minimal, mass-balance model for lifetime reproductive output measured in carbon-equivalent units. Let the lifetime reproductive output without traps be $R_{0}$, and with traps be $R_{\\mathrm{trap}}$. Assume:\n- Baseline net lifetime carbon available for reproduction without traps is $C_{0}$, so $R_{0} = C_{0}$.\n- Producing and maintaining $m$ trap leaves reduces whole-plant net photosynthetic gain by a fraction $\\delta$ over the lifetime due to increased respiration and reduced photosynthetic efficiency in shade, and requires a construction cost $C_{b}$ (carbon-equivalent) per trap, so the direct carbon balance change from leaves is $-\\delta C_{0} - m C_{b}$.\n- Prey capture provides a carbon-equivalent reproductive benefit that is proportional to the expected number of prey captured, with proportionality $b$ (carbon-equivalent per captured prey). Let prey density be $D$ (individuals $\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$), effective encounter cross-section per trap be $a$ (in $\\mathrm{m}^{2}$), per-encounter capture probability be $q$ (dimensionless), growing season length be $T$ (in days), and the number of active traps be $m$.

The costs are twofold: a fractional reduction in whole-plant photosynthesis, $-\\delta C_{0}$, and the construction cost of the traps, $-m C_{b}$. The benefit is the carbon-equivalent gain from prey capture, which is given as the product of the proportionality constant $b$ and the expected number of captured prey, $D\\,a\\,q\\,T\\,m$.
