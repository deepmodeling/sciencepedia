This significant discrepancy implies that a binding event does not occur upon every diffusional encounter. There must be an additional kinetic barrier to binding, such as the requirement for a specific orientation (steric factors) or a necessary conformational change in one or both proteins before the stable complex can form.

The rate of change of the complex concentration $x(t)$ is given by the law of mass action:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = k_{on} a(t)b(t) - k_{off} x(t) $$\nFrom the conservation of mass, we have:\n$$ a(t) = A_0 - x(t) $$\n$$ b(t) = B_0 - x(t) $$\nSubstituting these expressions into the rate equation gives the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $x(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = k_{on} (A_0 - x)(B_0 - x) - k_{off} x $$\nExpanding the terms, we obtain a quadratic form:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = k_{on} (A_0 B_0 - (A_0 + B_0)x + x^2) - k_{off} x $$\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = k_{on} x^2 - (k_{on}(A_0 + B_0) + k_{off}) x + k_{on} A_0 B_0 $$\nThis is a first-order nonlinear ODE that can be solved by separation of variables.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the closed-form expression for $x(t)$**\n\nTo solve the ODE, we first find the roots of the quadratic polynomial on the right-hand side, which correspond to the steady-state concentrations ($dx/dt = 0$):\n$$ k_{on} x^2 - (k_{on}(A_0 + B_0) + k_{off}) x + k_{on} A_0 B_0 = 0 $$\nDividing by $k_{on}$ and defining the dissociation constant $K_D = k_{off}/k_{on}$, the equation becomes:\n$$ x^2 - (A_0 + B_0 + K_D) x + A_0 B_0 = 0 $$\nThe two roots, which we will denote $x_+$ and $x_-$, are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$ x_{\\pm} = \\frac{(A_0 + B_0 + K_D) \\pm \\sqrt{(A_0 + B_0 + K_D)^2 - 4A_0 B_0}}{2} $$\nThe physically meaningful steady-state concentration, $x_{\\infty}$, must be less than both $A_0$ and $B_0$. This corresponds to the smaller root, $x_-$. The other root, $x_+$, is physically inaccessible. So, $x_{\\infty} = x_-$.\n\nThe ODE can be written as:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{k_{on}(x - x_+)(x - x_-)} = dt $$\nWe integrate this equation from $t=0$ to $t$ (corresponding to $x(0)=0$ to $x(t)$), using partial fraction decomposition:\n$$ \\int_0^{x(t)} \\frac{1}{(x' - x_+)(x' - x_-)} dx' = \\int_0^t k_{on} dt' $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{x_+ - x_-} \\int_0^{x(t)} \\left( \\frac{1}{x' - x_+} - \\frac{1}{x' - x_-} \\right) dx' = k_{on} t $$\nSince $0 \\le x(t)  x_-  x_+$, we have $|x'-x_-| = x_--x'$ and $|x'-x_+| = x_+-x'$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{x_+ - x_-} \\left[ \\ln(x_+ - x') - \\ln(x_- - x') \\right]_0^{x(t)} = k_{on} t $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{x_+ - x_-} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_+ - x'}{x_- - x'}\\right) \\right]_0^{x(t)} = k_{on} t $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_+ - x(t)}{x_- - x(t)}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_+}{x_-}\\right) = k_{on} (x_+ - x_-) t $$\n$$ \\ln\\left( \\frac{x_-(x_+ - x(t))}{x_+(x_- - x(t))} \\right) = k_{on} (x_+ - x_-) t $$\nExponentiating both sides and solving for $x(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{x_-(x_+ - x(t))}{x_+(x_- - x(t))} = \\exp(k_{on}(x_+ - x_-)t) $$\n$$ x_- x_+ - x_- x(t) = (x_+ x_- - x_+ x(t)) \\exp(k_{on}(x_+ - x_-)t) $$\n$$ x(t) (x_+ \\exp(k_{on}(x_+ - x_-)t) - x_-) = x_+ x_- (\\exp(k_{on}(x_+ - x_-)t) - 1) $$\n$$ x(t) = \\frac{x_+ x_- (1 - \\exp(-k_{on}(x_+ - x_-)t))}{x_+ - x_- \\exp(-k_{on}(x_+ - x_-)t)} $$\nwhere $x_{\\pm}$ are defined as above. This is the closed-form expression for $x(t)$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the steady-state fraction $f_{\\infty}$**\n\nThe steady-state fraction of CRY2 in complex is $f_{\\infty} = x_{\\infty}/A_0$, where $x_{\\infty}$ is the steady-state concentration of the complex. As derived, $x_{\\infty}$ is the smaller root, $x_-$, of the quadratic equation $x^2 - (A_0 + B_0 + K_D) x + A_0 B_0 = 0$.\n\nFirst, we must work with consistent units. The problem specifies using nM for concentrations and s for time.\nGiven:\n$A_0 = 100\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$B_0 = 200\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$k_{on} = 5 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}\\,s^{-1}} = 5 \\times 10^{6} \\times (10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{nM^{-1}}) \\mathrm{s^{-1}} = 5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{nM^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$\n$k_{off} = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n\nThe dissociation constant $K_D$ is:\n$$ K_D = \\frac{k_{off}}{k_{on}} = \\frac{0.01\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}}{5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{nM^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}} = 2\\,\\mathrm{nM} $$\nNow, we solve for $x_{\\infty}$ by substituting the values into the quadratic equation:\n$$ x_{\\infty}^2 - (100 + 200 + 2) x_{\\infty} + (100)(200) = 0 $$\n$$ x_{\\infty}^2 - 302 x_{\\infty} + 20000 = 0 $$\nUsing the quadratic formula, the roots are:\n$$ x_{\\pm} = \\frac{302 \\pm \\sqrt{(-302)^2 - 4(1)(20000)}}{2} $$\n$$ x_{\\pm} = \\frac{302 \\pm \\sqrt{91204 - 80000}}{2} $$\n$$ x_{\\pm} = \\frac{302 \\pm \\sqrt{11204}}{2} $$\n$$ x_{\\pm} \\approx \\frac{302 \\pm 105.84895}{2} $$\nThe two roots are:\n$$ x_+ \\approx \\frac{302 + 105.84895}{2} \\approx 203.924\\,\\mathrm{nM} $$\n$$ x_- \\approx \\frac{302 - 105.84895}{2} \\approx 98.0755\\,\\mathrm{nM} $$\nThe concentration of the complex $x$ cannot exceed the initial concentration of the limiting reactant, $A_0 = 100\\,\\mathrm{nM}$. Therefore, the physically correct steady-state concentration is the smaller root:\n$$ x_{\\infty} = x_- \\approx 98.0755\\,\\mathrm{nM} $$\nFinally, we compute the desired fraction $f_{\\infty}$:\n$$ f_{\\infty} = \\frac{x_{\\infty}}{A_0} = \\frac{98.0755\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{100\\,\\mathrm{nM}} = 0.980755 $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required:\n$$ f_{\\infty} \\approx 0.9808 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9808}$$", "id": "2755622"}]}
