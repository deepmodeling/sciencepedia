The assimilated energy of $S_1$ is $C_{S_1, B} = 8.4$.\n    -   The portion of $S_1$'s assimilation derived from herbivores is from an ingestion of $0.75 \\cdot 12 = 9$. This gives $9 \\cdot A_A = 9 \\cdot 0.8 = 7.2$.\n    -   The fraction of $S_1$'s assimilated energy that is herbivore-derived is $7.2 / 8.4 = 6/7$.\n    -   Therefore, the herbivore-derived energy $T_1$ obtains via $S_1$ is $(6/7) \\cdot C_{T_1 \\leftarrow S_1} = (6/7) \\cdot 3.2$.\n    -   Total herbivore-derived assimilation for $T_1$ is the sum of direct and indirect pathways: $3.2 + (6/7) \\cdot 3.2 = 3.2 \\cdot (1 + 6/7) = 3.2 \\cdot (13/7) = 41.6/7$.\n    -   The total assimilation for $T_1$ is $6.4$. The fraction is $(41.6/7) / 6.4 = 41.6 / (7 \\cdot 6.4) = 41.6 / 44.8 = 416 / 448 = 13/14$.\nSince $1 \\neq 13/14$, the fractions are not the same.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. The total consumer respiration (summed over all consumers) is lower in Scenario B than in Scenario A.**\nTotal consumer respiration is $R_{tot} = R \\cdot C_{tot}$, where $R=0.6$ is a constant. This statement is equivalent to asking if total consumer assimilation $C_{tot}$ is lower in Scenario B than in Scenario A.\n-   Total assimilation in Scenario A: $C_{A, tot} = 24$. Total respiration: $R_{A, tot} = 0.6 \\cdot 24 = 14.4$.\n-   Total assimilation in Scenario B: $C_{B, tot} = 22.8$. Total respiration: $R_{B, tot} = 0.6 \\cdot 22.8 = 13.68$.\nSince $13.68 < 14.4$, the total consumer respiration is lower in Scenario B.\n**Verdict: Correct**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCE}$$", "id": "2487269"}]}
