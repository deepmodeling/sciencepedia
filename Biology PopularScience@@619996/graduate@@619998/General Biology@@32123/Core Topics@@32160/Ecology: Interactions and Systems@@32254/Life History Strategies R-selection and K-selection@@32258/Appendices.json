This exercise provides hands-on practice in calculating $r$ directly from life table data by numerically solving the famous Euler–Lotka equation, $\\sum \\ell_x m_x \\exp(-rx) = 1$. By applying a root-finding algorithm to diverse life history schedules, you will develop a core computational skill in demography and gain a deeper intuition for how survivorship and fecundity patterns shape population dynamics [@problem_id:2811580].", "problem": "You are studying age-structured life histories to connect fundamental demography to the concept of life history strategies in terms of early versus late reproduction. Let $x$ denote age measured in years, $\\ell_x$ denote survivorship to age $x$ (the probability a newborn survives to age $x$), and $m_x$ denote the expected number of female offspring produced by an individual at age $x$ during the interval from $x$ to $x+1$. The intrinsic rate of increase $r$ (in $\\text{year}^{-1}$) is defined as the constant per-capita exponential growth rate under a stable age distribution. Under this definition, the replacement condition states that the expected lifetime reproduction of a newborn, discounted by the exponential growth of the population, equals one. Use this replacement condition to derive the unique real value of $r$ associated with a given life table $(\\ell_x, m_x)$, and compute $r$ numerically.\n\nFundamental base to use:\n- Basic age-structured accounting: survivorship $\\ell_x$ and fecundity $m_x$ determine expected reproduction through ages.\n- Exponential growth definition: if population size is $N(t)$ at time $t$ in years, then $N(t) = N(0)\\, e^{r t}$ for constant intrinsic rate $r$.\n- Replacement condition under a stable age distribution: the expected lifetime reproduction of a newborn, with each reproductive contribution discounted by the factor implied by exponential growth, equals one.\n\nYour task:\n- For each life table below, compute the unique real $r$ (in $\\text{year}^{-1}$) implied by the replacement condition described above. Solve this by numerical root-finding; a robust bracket such as $[-10,10]$ (in $\\text{year}^{-1}$) must be used to ensure the root is bracketed when reproduction occurs at at least one strictly positive age.\n- Output one real number per life table, rounded to $6$ decimal places, representing $r$ in $\\text{year}^{-1}$ for that life table.\n- Scientific interpretation guidance (for your reasoning, not for the output): larger positive $r$ typically reflects earlier and/or higher effective reproduction, which is aligned with selection for rapid population increase in low-density environments (often described as $r$-selection). Values of $r$ near zero indicate near-replacement schedules, and negative $r$ indicate subreplacement schedules that would decline in the absence of density feedback.\n\nTest suite (ages in years; lists are aligned by index):\n- Case $1$ (early reproduction concentrated at young ages):\n  - ages: $[0,1,2,3,4,5]$\n  - $\\ell_x$: $[1.0,0.6,0.4,0.3,0.2,0.1]$\n  - $m_x$: $[0.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0]$\n- Case $2$ (later reproduction with substantial survivorship):\n  - ages: $[0,1,2,3,4,5]$\n  - $\\ell_x$: $[1.0,0.9,0.8,0.7,0.6,0.5]$\n  - $m_x$: $[0.0,0.0,0.0,1.5,1.5,1.0]$\n- Case $3$ (subreplacement reproduction):\n  - ages: $[0,1,2,3,4]$\n  - $\\ell_x$: $[1.0,0.7,0.5,0.2,0.05]$\n  - $m_x$: $[0.0,0.2,0.2,0.1,0.0]$\n- Case $4$ (near replacement with reproduction very early):\n  - ages: $[0,1,2,3]$\n  - $\\ell_x$: $[1.0,0.8,0.6,0.4]$\n  - $m_x$: $[0.0,0.8,0.6,0.0]$\n- Case $5$ (early reproduction including age $0$, but supplemented at age $1$):\n  - ages: $[0,1,2,3]$\n  - $\\ell_x$: $[1.0,0.5,0.25,0.1]$\n  - $m_x$: $[0.5,0.5,0.0,0.0]$\n\nNumerical and output requirements:\n- Use a robust root-finding method to solve for $r$ on $[-10,10]$ (in $\\text{year}^{-1}$) for each case.

It presents a standard task in quantitative population ecology: the calculation of the intrinsic rate of population increase, $r$, from fundamental demographic data. A rigorous analysis confirms that all provided information is self-contained, consistent, and sufficient for deriving a unique, meaningful solution for each test case. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the intrinsic rate of increase, $r$, based on a life table consisting of age-specific survivorship, $\\ell_x$, and fecundity, $m_x$. The foundation for this calculation is the replacement condition under stable exponential growth, which we must first formalize into a mathematical equation.\n\n**1. Formulation of the Euler-Lotka Equation**\n\nThe replacement condition states that the expected lifetime production of offspring by a newborn, discounted by population growth, must equal unity. Let us dissect this principle.\n- The probability that a newborn survives to age $x$ is given by $\\ell_x$.\n- The expected number of female offspring produced by an individual at age $x$ is $m_x$.\n- Thus, the expected number of offspring produced by a newborn at its future age $x$ is the product $\\ell_x m_x$.\n- The population is assumed to grow exponentially, $N(t) = N(0)e^{rt}$, where $r$ is the intrinsic rate of increase. An offspring born at time $t=x$ to a parent from the $t=0$ cohort enters a population that is $e^{rx}$ times larger. Its relative contribution to the population's per-capita growth is therefore discounted by a factor of $e^{-rx}$ compared to an offspring born at time $t=0$.\n- Summing these discounted contributions over all ages $x$ and equating to $1$ (for replacement) yields the discrete form of the Euler-Lotka characteristic equation:\n$$\n\\sum_{x=0}^{\\omega} \\ell_x m_x e^{-rx} = 1\n$$\nwhere $\\omega$ is the maximum age in the life table. To solve for $r$, we must find the root of the following function:\n$$\nf(r) = \\left( \\sum_{x=0}^{\\omega} \\ell_x m_x e^{-rx} \\right) - 1 = 0\n$$\n\n**2. Analysis and Numerical Solution**\n\nTo confirm that a unique solution exists, we analyze the properties of $f(r)$. The derivative of $f(r)$ with respect to $r$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dr} = \\sum_{x=0}^{\\omega} \\ell_x m_x (-x) e^{-rx} = -\\sum_{x=0}^{\\omega} x \\ell_x m_x e^{-rx}\n$$\nSince age $x$, survivorship $\\ell_x$, and fecundity $m_x$ are non-negative quantities, and the problem ensures reproduction occurs at some strictly positive age ($x>0$), the derivative $\\frac{df}{dr}$ is strictly negative for all real $r$. This proves that $f(r)$ is a strictly monotonic decreasing function of $r$. Consequently, if a root exists, it must be unique.\n\nThe existence of a root within the specified interval $[-10, 10]$ is guaranteed.\n- As $r \\to -10$, the terms $e^{-rx} = e^{10x}$ become very large for $x > 0$. Since each test case includes reproduction at $x \\geq 1$, the sum $\\sum \\ell_x m_x e^{10x}$ will be large and positive, ensuring $f(-10) > 0$.\n- As $r \\to 10$, the terms $e^{-rx} = e^{-10x}$ approach $0$ rapidly for $x > 0$. The function approaches $f(10) \\approx \\ell_0 m_0 - 1$. For all supplied test cases, $\\ell_0 m_0 < 1$, which ensures $f(10) < 0$.\nSince $f(r)$ is continuous and $f(-10) > 0$ while $f(10) < 0$, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees at least one root exists in the interval $[-10, 10]$. The monotonicity guarantees it is unique.\n\nA robust numerical root-finding algorithm is appropriate. We will use a bracketing method, such as Brent's method, which is available in the `scipy` library. This method is efficient and guarantees convergence given that the root is bracketed, as we have shown it is.\n\n**3. Application to Life History Data**\n\nFor each of the five test cases, we construct the specific function $f(r)$ using the provided arrays for ages $x$, survivorship $\\ell_x$, and fecundity $m_x$. We then apply the numerical solver to find the unique root $r$ in the interval $[-10, 10]$.\n\nA brief examination of the net reproductive rate, $R_0 = \\sum_x \\ell_x m_x$, provides insight into the expected sign of $r$.\n- If $R_0 > 1$, the population grows, so $r>0$.\n- If $R_0 < 1$, the population declines, so $r<0$.\n- If $R_0 = 1$, the population is at exact replacement, so $r=0$.\n\nFor Case $1$ ($R_0=2.9$) and Case $2$ ($R_0=2.45$), we expect $r > 0$. Case $1$ features earlier reproduction, which is weighted more heavily (less discounted) in the Euler-Lotka sum, suggesting $r_1$ will be significantly larger than $r_2$. For Case $3$ ($R_0=0.26$) and Case $5$ ($R_0=0.75$), we expect $r < 0$. For Case $4$, $R_0=1.0$ exactly, which implies $r=0$. These expectations are confirmed by the numerical results. The calculations yield the precise values of $r$ that balance survivorship, fecundity, and reproductive timing to satisfy the stable growth condition.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe analysis proceeds by addressing the three tasks specified in the problem statement.\n\nTask 1: Computation of Demographic Parameters\n\nThe fundamental demographic parameters are the net reproductive rate, $R_0$, the cohort generation time, $T$, and the intrinsic rate of increase, $r$.\n\nThe net reproductive rate is defined as the average number of female offspring produced by a female over her lifetime:\n$$R_0 = \\sum_{x=0}^{\\infty} l_x m_x$$\nThe cohort generation time is the mean age of mothers in a cohort at the time of offspring bearing:\n$$T = \\frac{\\sum_{x=0}^{\\infty} x l_x m_x}{\\sum_{x=0}^{\\infty} l_x m_x} = \\frac{\\sum_{x=0}^{\\infty} x l_x m_x}{R_0}$$\nThe intrinsic rate of increase, $r$, is determined by the discrete-time Euler–Lotka equation, which relates population growth to the life history schedule:\n$$\\sum_{x=0}^{\\infty} l_x m_x \\exp(-r x) = 1$$\n\nThese parameters are now computed for each species.\n\nFor Species A:\nThis species exhibits semelparity with reproduction occurring only at age $x=1$. Therefore, the only non-zero term in the summations is for $x=1$.\nThe net reproductive rate is:\n$$R_{0, \\mathrm{A}} = l_1 m_1 = \\left(\\frac{3}{10}\\right) \\times 4 = \\frac{12}{10} = \\frac{6}{5} = 1.2$$\nThe cohort generation time is:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{1 \\cdot l_1 m_1}{R_{0, \\mathrm{A}}} = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\frac{6}{5}}{\\frac{6}{5}} = 1 \\text{ year}$$\nThe intrinsic rate of increase $r_{\\mathrm{A}}$ is found using the Euler–Lotka equation, which simplifies for a semelparous organism:\n$$l_1 m_1 \\exp(-r_{\\mathrm{A}} \\cdot 1) = 1$$\n$$R_{0, \\mathrm{A}} \\exp(-r_{\\mathrm{A}}) = 1 \\implies \\frac{6}{5} \\exp(-r_{\\mathrm{A}}) = 1$$\n$$\\exp(r_{\\mathrm{A}}) = \\frac{6}{5}$$\n$$r_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{6}{5}\\right) = \\ln(1.2) \\text{ per year}$$\n\nFor Species B:\nThis species is also semelparous, but with reproduction delayed until age $x=3$. The only non-zero term in the summations is for $x=3$.\nThe net reproductive rate is:\n$$R_{0, \\mathrm{B}} = l_3 m_3 = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^{3} \\times \\left(\\frac{75}{32}\\right) = \\frac{64}{125} \\times \\frac{75}{32} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 32}{5 \\cdot 25} \\times \\frac{3 \\cdot 25}{32} = \\frac{6}{5} = 1.2$$\nThe cohort generation time is:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{3 \\cdot l_3 m_3}{R_{0, \\mathrm{B}}} = \\frac{3 \\cdot \\frac{6}{5}}{\\frac{6}{5}} = 3 \\text{ years}$$\nThe intrinsic rate of increase $r_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is found from the simplified Euler–Lotka equation:\n$$l_3 m_3 \\exp(-r_{\\mathrm{B}} \\cdot 3) = 1$$\n$$R_{0, \\mathrm{B}} \\exp(-3 r_{\\mathrm{B}}) = 1 \\implies \\frac{6}{5} \\exp(-3 r_{\\mathrm{B}}) = 1$$\n$$\\exp(3 r_{\\mathrm{B}}) = \\frac{6}{5}$$\n$$3 r_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{6}{5}\\right) \\implies r_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\ln\\left(\\frac{6}{5}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\ln(1.2) \\text{ per year}$$\n\nSummary of parameters:\n- Species A: $R_{0, \\mathrm{A}} = 1.2$, $T_{\\mathrm{A}} = 1$ year, $r_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\ln(1.2) \\text{ year}^{-1}$.\n- Species B: $R_{0, \\mathrm{B}} = 1.2$, $T_{\\mathrm{B}} = 3$ years, $r_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\ln(1.2) \\text{ year}^{-1}$.\n\nTask 2: Justification based on $r$-$K$ Selection Theory\n\nThe framework of $r$-$K$ selection describes two opposing strategies favored under different ecological conditions. $r$-selection favors traits that maximize the intrinsic rate of population increase ($r$), which is advantageous in unstable, sparsely populated environments. $K$-selection favors traits that enhance competitive ability and efficiency of resource use, which is advantageous in stable environments at or near the carrying capacity ($K$).\n\nComparison of the two species reveals a classic life history trade-off. Both species have the exact same net reproductive rate, $R_0 = 1.2$, meaning their lifetime reproductive output is identical. However, the timing of this reproduction differs dramatically, leading to different population growth dynamics.\n- Species A exhibits a strategy of early reproduction ($T_{\\mathrm{A}} = 1$) and low pre-reproductive survivorship ($l_1 = 0.3$). This leads to a high intrinsic rate of increase, $r_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\ln(1.2)$.\n- Species B exhibits a strategy of delayed reproduction ($T_{\\mathrm{B}} = 3$) but high pre-reproductive survivorship ($l_3 = (4/5)^3 \\approx 0.512$). This leads to a much lower intrinsic rate of increase, $r_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\ln(1.2)$. In fact, $r_{\\mathrm{A}} = 3 r_{\\mathrm{B}}$.\n\nMechanistic Justification:\n- **Frequent disturbance (far below carrying capacity)**: This scenario constitutes an $r$-selecting environment. After a disturbance, empty patches become available for colonization. The critical factor for success is the speed at which a population can grow to occupy these patches. Species A, with its significantly higher intrinsic rate of increase ($r_\\mathrm{A} > r_\\mathrm{B}$), will exhibit much faster exponential growth. Its short generation time ($T_\\mathrm{A} = 1$) allows it to multiply rapidly, establishing a large population before Species B can complete a single generation. Therefore, Species A is the superior colonizer and would be favored under conditions of frequent disturbance. It is a classic $r$-strategist.\n\n- **Long-term stable, near-carrying-capacity conditions**: This scenario constitutes a $K$-selecting environment. The habitat is saturated, and population growth is limited by intense competition for resources. The ability to grow rapidly ($r$) is less important than the ability to survive and compete effectively. Species B's life history, characterized by high investment in survival to a later age of maturity, is indicative of a $K$-strategist. The high survivorship ($l_1 = 0.8$, $l_2 = 0.64$) implies adaptations for enduring competition, predation, and other density-dependent pressures. While Species A reproduces quickly, its low survivorship suggests it is poorly adapted to crowded conditions. In a competitive showdown at high density, the robust, high-survival individuals of Species B would out-persist and ultimately displace Species A.

This exercise elevates our analysis from describing existing strategies to predicting which strategy should evolve by maximizing fitness, represented by the intrinsic rate of increase $r$.
