It provides all necessary parameters to compute the actual Gibbs energy change for a specific reaction under non-standard conditions. We shall proceed with the formal derivation.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between the actual Gibbs energy change, $\\Delta G$, and the transformed standard Gibbs energy change, $\\Delta G^{\\circ'}$, is given by the equation:\n$$ \\Delta G = \\Delta G^{\\circ'} + RT \\ln Q' $$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $Q'$ is the transformed reaction quotient.\n\nThe reaction is:\n$$ \\mathrm{malate} + \\mathrm{NAD^{+}} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{OAA} + \\mathrm{NADH} + \\mathrm{H^{+}} $$\nThe problem is set at a constant pH of $7$. Consequently, the concentration of $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ is held constant and its contribution is already incorporated into the transformed standard Gibbs energy, $\\Delta G^{\\circ'}$. The expression for the transformed reaction quotient, $Q'$, therefore excludes the $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ term:\n$$ Q' = \\frac{[\\mathrm{OAA}][\\mathrm{NADH}]}{[\\mathrm{malate}][\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}]} $$\nThis can be rewritten to utilize the given ratio:\n$$ Q' = \\frac{[\\mathrm{OAA}]}{[\\mathrm{malate}]} \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}]}{[\\mathrm{NADH}]} \\right)^{-1} $$\n\nFirst, we must express all concentrations in consistent units of moles per liter, $\\mathrm{M}$.\nThe given concentrations are:\n- $[\\mathrm{malate}] = 0.5\\ \\mathrm{mM} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{M} = 5 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{M}$\n- $[\\mathrm{OAA}] = 10\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M} = 10 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M} = 1 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{M}$\n\nThe given ratio is:\n- $\\frac{[\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}]}{[\\mathrm{NADH}]} = 8$\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of the reaction quotient $Q'$:\n$$ Q' = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{M}}{5 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{M}} \\times \\left( 8 \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{-5}}{5 \\times 10^{-4}} \\times \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ Q' = (0.2 \\times 10^{-1}) \\times \\frac{1}{8} = 0.02 \\times 0.125 = 0.0025 $$\nOr, more precisely as a fraction, $Q' = \\frac{1}{50} \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{400}$.\n\nNext, we substitute the known values into the equation for $\\Delta G$.

Since the calculated $\\Delta G = +14.26\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$ is positive, the forward reaction (oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate) is thermodynamically unfavorable, or endergonic, under the specified mitochondrial conditions. The reaction will not proceed spontaneously in the forward direction.\n\nThe analysis provides a clear illustration of regulation by the principle of mass action. The standard change $\\Delta G^{\\circ'}$ is a large positive value ($+29.7\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$), indicating the reaction is inherently unfavorable. However, the cellular conditions, specifically the very low product-to-reactant ratio ($Q' = 0.0025 \\ll 1$), generate a large negative contribution from the $RT \\ln Q'$ term ($-15.44\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$). This effect significantly reduces the energetic barrier but is insufficient to make the overall $\\Delta G$ negative. For the citric acid cycle to operate continuously, the reaction must be pulled forward. This is achieved through metabolic coupling: the product, oxaloacetate, is immediately and rapidly consumed by the highly exergonic citrate synthase reaction ($\\Delta G^{\\circ'} \\approx -32\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$). This subsequent reaction maintains the concentration of oxaloacetate at an extremely low level, ensuring that $Q'$ is kept so small that the actual $\\Delta G$ for the malate dehydrogenase reaction is close to zero or slightly negative *in vivo*, allowing the cycle to proceed.

The framework used is the Michaelis-Menten model, a fundamental concept in enzyme kinetics. The provided values for concentrations and constants are biologically plausible. The problem is well-posed; it provides all necessary information and assumptions required to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. It is a standard, formalizable problem in biochemistry.\n\nThe verdict is that the problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe initial velocity ($v$) of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, under the assumption of a quasi-steady-state for the enzyme-substrate complex, is described by the Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$v = \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_m + [S]}$$\nwhere $v$ is the initial reaction velocity, $V_{\\max}$ is the maximal velocity at saturating substrate concentration, $[S]$ is the substrate concentration, and $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant.\n\nThe problem states that the allosteric regulators ADP and ATP affect only the Michaelis constant ($K_m$), while the maximal velocity ($V_{\\max}$) remains unchanged. The substrate concentration, $[S]$, is also fixed. We can therefore write expressions for the initial velocity in the presence of the activator, ADP ($v_{\\mathrm{ADP}}$), and in the presence of the inhibitor, ATP ($v_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$).\n\nFor the ADP-activated case, the velocity is:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{ADP}} = \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_{m}^{\\mathrm{ADP}} + [S]}$$\n\nFor the ATP-inhibited case, the velocity is:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_{m}^{\\mathrm{ATP}} + [S]}$$\n\nThe task is to derive an expression for the ratio of these two velocities, $\\frac{v_{\\mathrm{ADP}}}{v_{\\mathrm{ATP}}}$.

Under the initial baseline condition, there is no citrate export to the cytosol, and OAA concentration is maintained constant by the existing network fluxes.\n\nNow impose a lipogenic condition in which a fraction $f = 0.30$ of the mitochondrial citrate produced is diverted to the cytosol, where it is cleaved by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) citrate lyase into cytosolic acetyl-coenzyme A (used for fatty acid synthesis) and cytosolic OAA.

The derivation must be based on the first principles of mass conservation.\n\nThe central principle for this problem is the maintenance of a steady state for the total pool of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates within the mitochondrion. At steady state, the concentration of any intermediate, and thus the total pool size, remains constant over time. This implies that the total rate of influx of carbon skeletons into the cycle (anaplerosis) must exactly balance the total rate of efflux of carbon skeletons from the cycle (cataplerosis). Mathematically, this condition is expressed as:\n$$\n\\sum v_{\\text{anaplerosis}} = \\sum v_{\\text{cataplerosis}}\n$$\n\nWe will analyze the system under two conditions: the initial baseline state and the subsequent lipogenic state.\n\n**Condition 1: Baseline Steady State**\n\nIn the initial state, the TCA cycle is operating at a steady state. The flux through citrate synthase is given as $v_{\\mathrm{CS},1} = 12.0$ nmol·min$^{-1}$·mg$^{-1}$ protein. The problem explicitly states that there is no citrate export to the cytosol.

Assuming it is the only significant anaplerotic flux under consideration, we have:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{PC},1} = 0\n$$\nThis result is logical: in a closed cycle with no leakage of intermediates, no compensating influx is required to maintain the pool.\n\n**Condition 2: Lipogenic Steady State**\n\nA new lipogenic condition is imposed. A fraction $f = 0.30$ of the citrate produced by citrate synthase is diverted from the mitochondrion to the cytosol. The citrate synthase flux, $v_{\\mathrm{CS}}$, which represents the rate of citrate production, is given as a baseline value of $v_{\\mathrm{CS}} = 12.0$ nmol·min$^{-1}$·mg$^{-1}$ protein. The problem asks what change is needed to maintain a constant mitochondrial $\\mathrm{OAA}$ concentration, which implies a new steady state must be achieved for the TCA cycle intermediate pool, with this same rate of citrate synthesis.\n\nThe export of citrate constitutes a cataplerotic flux, as it removes carbon skeletons from the mitochondrial TCA cycle pool. The rate of this cataplerotic flux, $v_{\\text{export}}$, is directly proportional to the citrate synthase flux and the fraction exported:\n$$\nv_{\\text{export}} = f \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{CS}}\n$$\nEach molecule of citrate exported represents the net loss of the carbon skeleton of one molecule of $\\mathrm{OAA}$ from the mitochondrial pool. The problem states that the carbons from the resulting cytosolic $\\mathrm{OAA}$ do not re-enter the mitochondrial $\\mathrm{OAA}$ pool, confirming this is a true cataplerotic loss.\n\nThe total cataplerotic flux in the lipogenic state is therefore:\n$$\n\\sum v_{\\text{cataplerosis},2} = v_{\\text{export}} = f \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{CS}}\n$$\nTo achieve the new steady state and maintain the constancy of the TCA cycle intermediate pool, the anaplerotic flux must increase to precisely match this new cataplerotic efflux.
