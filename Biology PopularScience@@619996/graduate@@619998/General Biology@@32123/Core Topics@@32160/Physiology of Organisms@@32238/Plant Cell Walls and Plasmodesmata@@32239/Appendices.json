It presents a simplified but standard biophysical model of a plant cell structure and poses a solvable problem based on elementary principles. The problem is valid.\n\nThe task is to derive an expression for the cross-sectional area of an idealized plasmodesma, calculate its value, and explain its relevance to diffusion.\n\nFirst, we derive the general expression for the cross-sectional area, $A$, of the cytoplasmic sleeve. The model describes this cross-section as an annulus, which is the planar region bounded by two concentric circles. Let the radius of the outer circle be $R_{o}$ and the radius of the inner circle be $R_{i}$.\n\nThe area of a circle is a fundamental geometric definition, given by the formula $A_{circle} = \\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius.\n\nThe area of the annulus, $A$, is the area of the larger circle, $A_{o}$, from which the area of the smaller, coaxial inner circle, $A_{i}$, has been removed.\nThe area of the outer circle is:\n$$A_{o} = \\pi R_{o}^2$$\nThe area of the inner circle is:\n$$A_{i} = \\pi R_{i}^2$$\nTherefore, the area of the annular sleeve is the difference between these two areas:\n$$A = A_{o} - A_{i} = \\pi R_{o}^2 - \\pi R_{i}^2$$\nBy factoring out the common term $\\pi$, we arrive at the general expression for the cross-sectional area:\n$$A = \\pi (R_{o}^2 - R_{i}^2)$$\nThis derivation begins from the elementary definition for the area of a circle, as required.\n\nSecond, we must evaluate this area for the specified values: the outer radius $R_{o} = 25 \\text{ nm}$ and the inner radius $R_{i} = 7 \\text{ nm}$. We substitute these values into our derived formula.\n$$A = \\pi \\left( (25)^2 - (7)^2 \\right)$$\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$A = \\pi (625 - 49)$$\n$$A = 576\\pi$$\nThe units are in square nanometers ($\\text{nm}^2$) because the radii are in nanometers. The exact area is $576\\pi \\text{ nm}^2$. The problem requires a numerical value rounded to $3$ significant figures. Using the value of $\\pi \\approx 3.14159265...$:\n$$A \\approx 576 \\times 3.14159265... \\approx 1809.557... \\text{ nm}^2$$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures, we obtain $1810 \\text{ nm}^2$. In standard scientific notation, this is $1.81 \\times 10^3 \\text{ nm}^2$.\n\nThird, the problem requires a qualitative explanation of how a change in the inner radius $R_{i}$ affects the diffusive flux, $J$, based on Fick's first law:\n$$J = -D A \\frac{\\Delta C}{L}$$\nIn this equation, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $A$ is the cross-sectional area available for diffusion, $\\Delta C$ is the concentration difference, and $L$ is the path length. The flux $J$ represents the rate of transfer of a substance. The problem specifies that all other parameters ($D$, $\\Delta C$, $L$, and even the outer radius $R_{o}$) are held constant.\nFrom the equation, it is clear that the flux $J$ is directly proportional to the cross-sectional area $A$:\n$$J \\propto A$$\nSubstituting our expression for $A$, we have:\n$$J \\propto \\pi(R_{o}^2 - R_{i}^2)$$\nGiven that $R_{o}$ is constant, the only variable on the right-hand side affecting $A$ (and thus $J$) is $R_{i}$. The relationship shows that an increase in $R_{i}$ leads to a decrease in the term $(R_{o}^2 - R_{i}^2)$, because a larger number is being subtracted from the constant $R_{o}^2$. A smaller area $A$ restricts the pathway for diffusion, thereby reducing the total diffusive flux $J$. Conversely, a decrease in $R_{i}$ (a thinner desmotubule) would widen the cytoplasmic sleeve, increase the area $A$, and thus increase the potential diffusive flux $J$. This demonstrates that the regulation of the desmotubule radius is a potential mechanism for controlling intercellular transport in plants.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.81 \\times 10^{3}}$$", "id": "2824107"}, {"introduction": "After establishing the conduits for transport, we turn to the dynamic process that shapes the plant body: cell growth.

A solution will be formulated based on the provided principles.\n\n**Solution Formulation**\nThe problem requires the calculation of two quantities: the relative growth rate, $\\dot{\\epsilon}$, and the absolute axial length increase, $\\Delta L$.\n\nFirst, we address the relative growth rate, $\\dot{\\epsilon}$. The problem states that the axial strain rate (which is synonymous with the relative growth rate) is proportional to the excess turgor pressure above the yield threshold. This relationship is formalized as:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon} = \\phi (P - Y) $$\nThis equation is applicable only if the turgor pressure exceeds the yield threshold, i.e., $P > Y$. The given values are $P = 0.60$ MPa and $Y = 0.40$ MPa. Since $0.60 > 0.40$, the condition for growth is met. We can now substitute the given values into the equation:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon} = (5 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ s}^{-1} \\text{ MPa}^{-1}) \\times (0.60 \\text{ MPa} - 0.40 \\text{ MPa}) $$\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon} = (5 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ s}^{-1} \\text{ MPa}^{-1}) \\times (0.20 \\text{ MPa}) $$\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ s}^{-1} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the relative growth rate is $\\dot{\\epsilon} = 1.000 \\times 10^{-6}$ s$^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we compute the absolute axial length increase, $\\Delta L$. The axial strain rate, $\\dot{\\epsilon}$, is defined as the instantaneous rate of change of length, $\\frac{dL}{dt}$, per unit length, $L$:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon} = \\frac{1}{L} \\frac{dL}{dt} $$\nSince the problem states that $P$, $Y$, and $\\phi$ are constant, the relative growth rate $\\dot{\\epsilon}$ is also constant over the time interval of interest. We can solve this first-order ordinary differential equation by separation of variables:\n$$ \\frac{dL}{L} = \\dot{\\epsilon} \\, dt $$\nWe integrate this equation from the initial state (length $L_0$ at time $t=0$) to the final state (length $L(t)$ at time $t$):\n$$ \\int_{L_0}^{L(t)} \\frac{1}{L'} dL' = \\int_0^t \\dot{\\epsilon} \\, dt' $$\n$$ \\ln(L(t)) - \\ln(L_0) = \\dot{\\epsilon} t $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{L(t)}{L_0}\\right) = \\dot{\\epsilon} t $$\nSolving for the length at time $t$, $L(t)$, yields the equation for exponential growth:\n$$ L(t) = L_0 \\exp(\\dot{\\epsilon} t) $$\nThe absolute axial length increase, $\\Delta L$, is the difference between the final length and the initial length:\n$$ \\Delta L = L(t) - L_0 = L_0 \\exp(\\dot{\\epsilon} t) - L_0 = L_0 (\\exp(\\dot{\\epsilon} t) - 1) $$\nTo perform the calculation, we must ensure all units are consistent. The time interval is given as $t = 2.00$ hours.
