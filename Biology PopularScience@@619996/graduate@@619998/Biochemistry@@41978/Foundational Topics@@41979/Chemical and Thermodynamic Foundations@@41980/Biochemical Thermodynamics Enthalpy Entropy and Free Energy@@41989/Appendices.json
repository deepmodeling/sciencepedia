Since $n_{H}$ is negative, this is equal to $(-n_{H}) \\times (-\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ion}}) = n_{H} \\times \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ion}}$.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the sign of $n_{H}$, the enthalpy contribution from the buffer is always $n_{H} \\cdot \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ion}}$.\n\nAccording to Hess's law, the observed enthalpy is the sum of the intrinsic and buffer-dependent contributions:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{int}} + n_{H} \\cdot \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ion}} $$\nThis equation is in the form of a linear equation, $y = c + mx$, where:\n- The dependent variable, $y$, is the observed binding enthalpy, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{obs}}$.\n- The independent variable, $x$, is the buffer's enthalpy of ionization, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ion}}$.\n- The slope of the line, $m$, is the net number of protons linked to binding, $n_{H}$.\n- The y-intercept, $c$, is the intrinsic binding enthalpy, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{int}}$.\n\nWe are given three data points ($\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ion}}$, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{obs}}$) corresponding to the three different buffers. We can use any two of these points to determine the slope, $n_{H}$. To maximize precision, it is best to use the two points with the most widely separated values of $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ion}}$, which are MES and Tris.\n\nLet the data for MES be point $1$ and for Tris be point $2$.\n- For MES: $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ion, 1}} = +14.8\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$ and $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{obs, 1}} = -31.12\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$.\n- For Tris: $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ion, 2}} = +47.0\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$ and $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{obs, 2}} = -11.80\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$.\n\nThe slope, $n_{H}$, is calculated as:\n$$ n_{H} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{obs, 2}} - \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{obs, 1}}}{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ion, 2}} - \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ion, 1}}} $$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$ n_{H} = \\frac{-11.80 - (-31.12)}{47.0 - 14.8} = \\frac{19.32}{32.2} = 0.6 $$\nThe result is a dimensionless quantity, which is correct for $n_{H}$. The positive sign indicates that a net of $0.6$ moles of protons are taken up by the protein per mole of ligand bound.\n\nNow, we can determine the intrinsic enthalpy, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{int}}$, by rearranging the linear equation and substituting the values from any of the three buffers. Using the data for MES:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{obs, 1}} - n_{H} \\cdot \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ion, 1}} $$\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{int}} = -31.12\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}} - (0.6) \\cdot (14.8\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}) $$\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{int}} = -31.12\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}} - 8.88\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}} = -40.0\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}} $$\nTo verify this result, we can perform the same calculation using the data for Tris:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{obs, 2}} - n_{H} \\cdot \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ion, 2}} $$\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{int}} = -11.80\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}} - (0.6) \\cdot (47.0\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}) $$\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{int}} = -11.80\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}} - 28.2\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}} = -40.0\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}} $$\nThe results are identical, confirming the consistency of the data with the linear model.\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answers to three significant figures.\nThe value for $n_{H}$ is $0.6$, which rounded to three significant figures is $0.600$.\nThe value for $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{int}}$ is $-40.0\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$, which is already expressed to three significant figures.\n\nThus, the net number of protons linked to binding is $n_{H} = 0.600$, and the intrinsic standard molar binding enthalpy is $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{int}} = -40.0\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.600 & -40.0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2545959"}]}
