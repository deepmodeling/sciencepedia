It is a well-posed question in biochemistry that requires the application of fundamental principles regarding metabolic pathways, specifically gluconeogenesis. The provided context, assumptions, and constraints are scientifically sound, consistent, and sufficient for a unique, verifiable solution.\n\nThe task is to determine the net nucleotide triphosphate requirement for the synthesis of one molecule of glucose from two molecules of pyruvate via gluconeogenesis in a hepatocyte. The calculation must be derived from the principle that gluconeogenesis reverses the near-equilibrium reactions of glycolysis while bypassing its irreversible reactions.\n\nFirst, we identify the energetically irreversible steps in the glycolytic pathway (from glucose to pyruvate). These steps are characterized by a large, negative Gibbs free energy change ($\\Delta G$) under cellular conditions, making them essentially unidirectional. There are three such steps:\n$1$. The phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, catalyzed by hexokinase or glucokinase, which consumes one molecule of adenosine triphosphate ($ATP$).\n$2$. The phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, catalyzed by phosphofructokinase-1 ($PFK-1$), which consumes one molecule of $ATP$.\n$3$. The conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate ($PEP$) to pyruvate, catalyzed by pyruvate kinase ($PK$), which generates one molecule of $ATP$.\n\nFor gluconeogenesis to proceed from pyruvate to glucose, these three irreversible steps must be bypassed by separate, energetically favorable reactions. The remaining seven steps of glycolysis are near equilibrium ($\\Delta G \\approx 0$) and are readily reversed by the same enzymes used in glycolysis.\n\nThe synthesis of one molecule of glucose requires two molecules of pyruvate, as glucose is a $6$-carbon molecule and pyruvate is a $3$-carbon molecule. Therefore, the stoichiometry of all reactions in the lower part of the pathway (from pyruvate to the triose phosphates) must be multiplied by a factor of $2$.\n\nLet us now analyze the nucleotide consumption at each bypass step and each reversed, near-equilibrium step for the synthesis of one glucose molecule from two pyruvate molecules.\n\n**Bypass $1$: Conversion of Pyruvate to Phosphoenolpyruvate ($PEP$)**\nThis bypass circumvents the pyruvate kinase reaction. It is a two-step process.\n\nStep $1A$: Pyruvate Carboxylase ($PC$). This reaction occurs in the mitochondria as specified. Two molecules of pyruvate are carboxylated to form two molecules of oxaloacetate. Each carboxylation reaction requires the hydrolysis of one $ATP$ molecule.\n$$2 \\times (\\text{Pyruvate} + \\text{HCO}_3^- + ATP \\rightarrow \\text{Oxaloacetate} + ADP + P_i)$$\nThe consumption for this step is $2$ molecules of $ATP$. This is a bypass step.\n\nStep $1B$: Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase ($PEPCK$). Two molecules of oxaloacetate are decarboxylated and phosphorylated to form two molecules of $PEP$. The problem specifies a cytosolic $PEPCK$, meaning oxaloacetate must first be shuttled out of the mitochondrion (typically as malate). Each phosphorylation requires one molecule of guanosine triphosphate ($GTP$).\n$$2 \\times (\\text{Oxaloacetate} + GTP \\rightarrow PEP + GDP + CO_2)$$\nThe consumption for this step is $2$ molecules of $GTP$. This is also a bypass step.\n\nThe total nucleotide cost for the first bypass is $2$ $ATP$ and $2$ $GTP$.\n\n**Reversible Steps from $PEP$ to Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate**\nThe two molecules of $PEP$ are converted to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate by reversing the near-equilibrium steps of glycolysis. We must inspect these steps for any nucleotide consumption.\nThe sequence is: $PEP \\rightarrow 2$-phosphoglycerate $\\rightarrow 3$-phosphoglycerate $\\rightarrow 1,3$-bisphosphoglycerate $\\rightarrow$ glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate $\\leftrightarrow$ dihydroxyacetone phosphate $\\rightarrow$ fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.\n\nMost of these steps (catalyzed by enolase, phosphoglycerate mutase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase, and aldolase) do not involve $ATP$ or $GTP$. However, one step does: the conversion of $3$-phosphoglycerate to $1,3$-bisphosphoglycerate, catalyzed by phosphoglycerate kinase ($PGK$).\n\nIn glycolysis, $PGK$ catalyzes the formation of $ATP$. In gluconeogenesis, the reaction is reversed and consumes $ATP$. Since we have two molecules of $3$-phosphoglycerate (derived from the two molecules of $PEP$), this step occurs twice.\n$$2 \\times (\\text{3-Phosphoglycerate} + ATP \\rightarrow \\text{1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate} + ADP)$$\nThe consumption for this step is $2$ molecules of $ATP$. This is a non-bypass, reversible step.\n\n**Bypass $2$: Conversion of Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to Fructose-6-phosphate**\nThis bypass circumvents the $PFK-1$ reaction. It is catalyzed by fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase ($FBPase-1$), which performs a hydrolysis reaction.\n$$\\text{Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate} + H_2O \\rightarrow \\text{Fructose-6-phosphate} + P_i$$\nThis step does not consume any $ATP$ or $GTP$.\n\n**Bypass $3$: Conversion of Glucose-6-phosphate to Glucose**\nThis bypass circumvents the hexokinase/glucokinase reaction. It is catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphatase, which also performs a hydrolysis.\n$$\\text{Glucose-6-phosphate} + H_2O \\rightarrow \\text{Glucose} + P_i$$\nThis step also consumes no $ATP$ or $GTP$.\n\n**Summary of Nucleotide Consumption**\nTo synthesize one molecule of glucose from two molecules of pyruvate, the net consumption of high-energy phosphate bonds is as follows:\n\nConsumption from bypass steps:\n- $2$ $ATP$ (from Pyruvate Carboxylase)\n- $2$ $GTP$ (from Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase)\n\nConsumption from non-bypass (reversible) steps:\n- $2$ $ATP$ (from Phosphoglycerate Kinase)\n\nTotal $ATP$ consumed: $2$ (from $PC$) $+ 2$ (from $PGK$) = $4$ $ATP$.\nTotal $GTP$ consumed: $2$ (from $PEPCK$) = $2$ $GTP$.\n\nThus, the total nucleotide requirement to synthesize one molecule of glucose from two molecules of pyruvate is $4$ molecules of $ATP$ and $2$ molecules of $GTP$. The problem requests the answer as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\end{pmatrix}$, where $a$ is the total $ATP$ consumed and $b$ is the total $GTP$ consumed.

The problem statement is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we establish the kinetic model. The enzyme, phosphofructokinase-1 ($E$), binds its substrate, fructose-6-phosphate ($S$), to form an enzyme-substrate complex ($ES$), which then converts to product, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate ($P$). The inhibitor, citrate ($I$), is described as a pure noncompetitive inhibitor. This means it can bind to both the free enzyme ($E$) and the enzyme-substrate complex ($ES$) with the same dissociation constant, $K_i$.

The Michaelis constant, $K_m$, is defined as $K_m = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}}}{k_1}$.

The consumption rate then becomes:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{cons},c} = V_{\\mathrm{p,eff}}^{\\max} \\frac{[\\mathrm{F2,6BP}]}{K_{\\mathrm{m,p}} + [\\mathrm{F2,6BP}]}\n$$\n\nAt steady-state, $\\frac{d[\\mathrm{F2,6BP}]}{dt} = 0$, which implies that the production and consumption rates are equal:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{prod},c} = v_{\\mathrm{cons},c}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the rates, we obtain the governing algebraic equation:\n$$\nV_{\\text{prod}} = V_{\\mathrm{p,eff}}^{\\max} \\frac{[\\mathrm{F2,6BP}]}{K_{\\mathrm{m,p}} + [\\mathrm{F2,6BP}]}\n$$\n\nThe maximum possible rate of consumption, $v_{\\mathrm{cons,max}}$, occurs when the enzyme is saturated with $[\\mathrm{F2,6BP}]$, i.e., as $[\\mathrm{F2,6BP}] \\to \\infty$. In this limit, the Michaelis-Menten term approaches $1$, and $v_{\\mathrm{cons},c} \\to V_{\\mathrm{p,eff}}^{\\max}$. A finite, non-negative steady-state concentration for $[\\mathrm{F2,6BP}]$ can only exist if the constant production rate $V_{\\text{prod}}$ can be matched by the consumption rate. This requires that the production rate must be strictly less than the maximal consumption rate, i.e., $V_{\\text{prod}} < V_{\\mathrm{p,eff}}^{\\max}$.\n\nThe problem specifies that if $V_{\\text{prod}} \\ge V_{\\mathrm{p,eff}}^{\\max}$ (within a numerical tolerance of $10^{-12}$), no finite steady-state is achievable, and the concentration would, in this model, increase without bound. In this case, the result must be reported as positive infinity.\n\nIf the condition $V_{\\text{prod}} < V_{\\mathrm{p,eff}}^{\\max}$ is met, we proceed to solve for $[\\mathrm{F2,6BP}]$. Let $X = [\\mathrm{F2,6BP}]$ for notational convenience.\n$$\nV_{\\text{prod}} = V_{\\mathrm{p,eff}}^{\\max} \\frac{X}{K_{\\mathrm{m,p}} + X}\n$$\nRearranging the equation to solve for $X$:\n$$\nV_{\\text{prod}} (K_{\\mathrm{m,p}} + X) = V_{\\mathrm{p,eff}}^{\\max} X\n$$\n$$\nV_{\\text{prod}} K_{\\mathrm{m,p}} + V_{\\text{prod}} X = V_{\\mathrm{p,eff}}^{\\max} X\n$$\n$$\nV_{\\text{prod}} K_{\\mathrm{m,p}} = (V_{\\mathrm{p,eff}}^{\\max} - V_{\\text{prod}}) X\n$$\nThis yields the explicit solution for the steady-state concentration:\n$$\nX = [\\mathrm{F2,6BP}]_{\\text{steady-state}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{prod}} \\cdot K_{\\mathrm{m,p}}}{V_{\\mathrm{p,eff}}^{\\max} - V_{\\text{prod}}}\n$$\nThe denominator $(V_{\\mathrm{p,eff}}^{\\max} - V_{\\text{prod}})$ is guaranteed to be positive under the condition for a finite steady-state, ensuring a physically meaningful (non-negative) concentration $X$.\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case and for each condition $c \\in \\{\\text{low}, \\text{high}\\}$ is as follows:\n1.  Extract all relevant parameters: $[{\\mathrm{F6P}}]$, $V_{\\mathrm{k}}^{\\max}$, $K_{\\mathrm{m,k}}$, $V_{\\mathrm{p}}^{\\max}$, $K_{\\mathrm{m,p}}$, and the condition-specific factors $\\alpha_c$ and $\\beta_c$.\n2.  Calculate the constant production rate: $V_{\\text{prod}} = \\alpha_c V_{\\mathrm{k}}^{\\max} \\frac{[{\\mathrm{F6P}}]}{K_{\\mathrm{m,k}} + [{\\mathrm{F6P}}]}$.\n3.  Calculate the effective maximal consumption rate: $V_{\\mathrm{p,eff}}^{\\max} = \\beta_c V_{\\mathrm{p}}^{\\max}$.\n4.  Apply the boundary check: If $V_{\\text{prod}} \\ge V_{\\mathrm{p,eff}}^{\\max} - 10^{-12}$, the result is positive infinity.\n5.  If a finite solution exists, calculate the steady-state concentration using the derived formula: $[\\mathrm{F2,6BP}]_c = \\frac{V_{\\text{prod}} \\cdot K_{\\mathrm{m,p}}}{V_{\\mathrm{p,eff}}^{\\max} - V_{\\text{prod}}}$.\n6.  Format the finite numerical result as a floating-point number rounded to six decimal places.\n7.
