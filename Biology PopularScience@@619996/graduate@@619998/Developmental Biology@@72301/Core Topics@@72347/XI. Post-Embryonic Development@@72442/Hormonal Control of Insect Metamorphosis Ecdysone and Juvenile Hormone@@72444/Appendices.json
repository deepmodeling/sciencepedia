Thus, $\\lambda_1 \\le -1$ is always negative. The stability is lost when $\\lambda_2$ changes sign from negative to positive, which occurs when $\\lambda_2 = 0$. The condition for the onset of bistability is therefore $C=1$:\n$$\n\\frac{anz^{n-1}}{(1+z^n)^2} = 1\n$$\nThis condition, along with the fixed point equation $a = z(1+z^n)$, defines the critical input strength $a_c(n)$ at which bistability first appears. We solve this system for $a_c$.\nFrom $a = z(1+z^n)$, we have $1+z^n = a/z$. Substituting this into the condition $C=1$:\n$$\n\\frac{anz^{n-1}}{(a/z)^2} = 1 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{anz^{n-1}z^2}{a^2} = 1 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{nz^{n+1}}{a} = 1 \\quad \\implies \\quad a = nz^{n+1}\n$$\nWe now have two expressions for $a$. Equating them allows us to find $z$ at the bifurcation point:\n$$\nz(1+z^n) = nz^{n+1}\n$$\nAssuming $z \\neq 0$, we can divide by $z$:\n$$\n1+z^n = nz^n \\quad \\implies \\quad 1 = (n-1)z^n \\quad \\implies \\quad z^n = \\frac{1}{n-1}\n$$\nThis requires $n>1$, which is given. The concentration at the critical point is $z = (n-1)^{-1/n}$.\nFinally, we substitute this value of $z$ back into the expression $a_c = nz^{n+1}$:\n$$\na_c(n) = n \\cdot z \\cdot z^n = n \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{n-1}\\right)^{1/n} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{n-1}\\right)\n$$\n$$\na_c(n) = \\frac{n}{n-1} (n-1)^{-1/n} = n (n-1)^{-(1+1/n)} = n (n-1)^{-\\frac{n+1}{n}}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the critical input strength required for the onset of bistability.\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe need to compute the minimal $20$E concentration, $S^{\\ast}$, at which bistability is possible. This occurs when the effective input strength $a$ reaches the critical value $a_c$.\nThe given parameters are $n=3$, $\\alpha_{E}=6$, $p=2$, and $K_{S}=100\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the critical input strength $a_c$ for $n=3$:\n$$\na_c(3) = \\frac{3}{3-1} (3-1)^{-1/3} = \\frac{3}{2} (2)^{-1/3} = \\frac{3}{2^{1} \\cdot 2^{1/3}} = \\frac{3}{2^{4/3}}\n$$\nNext, we use the expression for $a$ in terms of the $20$E concentration $S$:\n$$\na(S) = \\alpha_{E} s(S) = \\alpha_{E} \\frac{S^{p}}{K_{S}^{p} + S^{p}}\n$$\nBistability becomes possible when $a(S) \\ge a_c(3)$. The minimal concentration $S^{\\ast}$ corresponds to the equality $a(S^{\\ast}) = a_c(3)$.\nSubstituting the given parameter values:\n$$\n6 \\cdot \\frac{(S^{\\ast})^{2}}{(100)^{2} + (S^{\\ast})^{2}} = \\frac{3}{2^{4/3}}\n$$\nWe solve for $S^{\\ast}$. Let $X = (S^{\\ast})^2$ and $K_S^2 = (100)^2 = 10000$.\n$$\n\\frac{X}{10000 + X} = \\frac{3}{6 \\cdot 2^{4/3}} = \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 2^{4/3}} = \\frac{1}{2^{7/3}}\n$$\n$$\n2^{7/3} X = 10000 + X\n$$\n$$\nX (2^{7/3} - 1) = 10000\n$$\n$$\nX = \\frac{10000}{2^{7/3} - 1}\n$$\nNow we solve for $S^{\\ast} = \\sqrt{X}$:\n$$\nS^{\\ast} = \\sqrt{\\frac{10000}{2^{7/3} - 1}} = \\frac{100}{\\sqrt{2^{7/3} - 1}}\n$$\nLet's compute the numerical value:\n$2^{7/3} = (2^7)^{1/3} = 128^{1/3} \\approx 5.039684$.\n$$\nS^{\\ast} \\approx \\frac{100}{\\sqrt{5.039684 - 1}} = \\frac{100}{\\sqrt{4.039684}} \\approx \\frac{100}{2.0099} \\approx 49.7536\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the minimal $20$E concentration required for bistability is $49.8\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{49.8}$$", "id": "2643753"}]}
