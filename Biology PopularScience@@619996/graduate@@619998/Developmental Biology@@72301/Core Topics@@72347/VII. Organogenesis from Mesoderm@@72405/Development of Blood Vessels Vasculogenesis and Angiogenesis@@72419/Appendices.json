The context of oxygen availability constraining vessel patterning is accurate within developmental biology. The parameters $D$ and $k$ are within physiologically plausible ranges.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It presents a second-order linear ordinary differential equation with two specified boundary conditions, which guarantees the existence of a unique, stable solution. The tasks are specified clearly.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of subjective claims or ambiguity.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency:** All necessary parameters and conditions are provided. A unit conversion between micrometers and centimeters is required, but this is a standard step in physical calculations and does not represent an incompleteness.\n\nThe problem is deemed valid and scientifically sound. A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe governing equation for the oxygen concentration $c(x)$ is given as:\n$$D\\,\\frac{d^{2}c}{dx^{2}} - k\\,c = 0$$\nWe can rearrange this equation into a more standard form:\n$$\\frac{d^{2}c}{dx^{2}} - \\frac{k}{D}c = 0$$\nAs indicated by the problem, we introduce the characteristic inverse length $\\lambda$, defined by $\\lambda^2 = k/D$. The equation then becomes:\n$$\\frac{d^{2}c}{dx^{2}} - \\lambda^2 c = 0$$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation. The general solution can be expressed in terms of exponential functions or, more conveniently for this problem's symmetry, hyperbolic functions. Given the symmetric boundary conditions $c(0)=c_0$ and $c(s)=c_0$, it is most efficient to shift the coordinate system origin to the midpoint of the domain. Let $x' = x - s/2$, so the domain is now $x' \\in [-s/2, s/2]$. The governing equation is invariant under this translation:\n$$\\frac{d^{2}c}{dx'^{2}} - \\lambda^2 c = 0$$\nThe boundary conditions in the new coordinate system are $c(-s/2) = c_0$ and $c(s/2) = c_0$. The general solution in this symmetric domain is best written as:\n$$c(x') = A \\cosh(\\lambda x') + B \\sinh(\\lambda x')$$\nApplying the boundary condition at $x' = s/2$:\n$$c(s/2) = A \\cosh(\\lambda s/2) + B \\sinh(\\lambda s/2) = c_0$$\nApplying the boundary condition at $x' = -s/2$:\n$$c(-s/2) = A \\cosh(-\\lambda s/2) + B \\sinh(-\\lambda s/2) = A \\cosh(\\lambda s/2) - B \\sinh(\\lambda s/2) = c_0$$\nAdding these two equations gives $2A \\cosh(\\lambda s/2) = 2c_0$, which yields $A = \\frac{c_0}{\\cosh(\\lambda s/2)}$.\nSubtracting the second equation from the first gives $2B \\sinh(\\lambda s/2) = 0$.

For steady, fully developed, axisymmetric flow, the axial momentum equation from the Navier-Stokes equations in cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\theta, z)$ simplifies significantly. The only non-zero velocity component is the axial velocity $v_z$, which is a function of radius $r$ only, i.e., $v_z = v(r)$. The momentum equation reduces to a balance between pressure forces and viscous forces:\n$$ \\frac{dp}{dz} = \\frac{\\mu}{r} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r \\frac{dv}{dr} \\right) $$\nHere, $\\frac{dp}{dz}$ is the axial pressure gradient, which must be constant for fully developed flow. Let us denote this constant gradient as $G$.\n$$ G = \\frac{\\mu}{r} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r \\frac{dv}{dr} \\right) $$\nRearranging and integrating with respect to $r$ yields:\n$$ \\int \\frac{Gr}{\\mu} dr = \\int d\\left( r \\frac{dv}{dr} \\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{Gr^2}{2\\mu} + C_1 = r \\frac{dv}{dr} $$\nDividing by $r$ gives the expression for the velocity gradient:\n$$ \\frac{dv}{dr} = \\frac{Gr}{2\\mu} + \\frac{C_1}{r} $$\nTo ensure the velocity is finite at the centerline of the vessel ($r=0$), the term $\\frac{C_1}{r}$ mandates that the integration constant $C_1$ must be zero, because $\\ln(r)$ would otherwise appear upon the next integration, which is singular at $r=0$. Thus, $C_1=0$.\n$$ \\frac{dv}{dr} = \\frac{Gr}{2\\mu} $$\nIntegrating a second time with respect to $r$ gives the velocity profile:\n$$ v(r) = \\int \\frac{Gr}{2\\mu} dr = \\frac{Gr^2}{4\\mu} + C_2 $$\nThe constant $C_2$ is determined by the no-slip boundary condition at the vessel wall, which states that the fluid velocity is zero at $r=R$:\n$$ v(R) = 0 \\implies \\frac{GR^2}{4\\mu} + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = -\\frac{GR^2}{4\\mu} $$\nSubstituting $C_2$ back into the velocity profile expression, we obtain the parabolic velocity profile characteristic of Poiseuille flow:\n$$ v(r) = \\frac{G}{4\\mu} (r^2 - R^2) $$\nFor flow to occur in the positive $z$-direction, the pressure must decrease, so $G = \\frac{dp}{dz}$ must be negative.\n\nNext, we relate the pressure gradient $G$ to the volumetric flow rate $Q$. The flow rate is the integral of the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area $A$ of the vessel. The differential area element is $dA = 2\\pi r dr$.\n$$ Q = \\int_{A} v(r) dA = \\int_0^R \\frac{G}{4\\mu}(r^2 - R^2) (2\\pi r) dr $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{G\\pi}{2\\mu} \\int_0^R (r^3 - R^2r) dr $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{G\\pi}{2\\mu} \\left[ \\frac{r^4}{4} - \\frac{R^2r^2}{2} \\right]_0^R = \\frac{G\\pi}{2\\mu} \\left( \\frac{R^4}{4} - \\frac{R^4}{2} \\right) = \\frac{G\\pi}{2\\mu} \\left( -\\frac{R^4}{4} \\right) $$\n$$ Q = -\\frac{G\\pi R^4}{8\\mu} $$\nThis is the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. We can now express the pressure gradient $G$ in terms of the flow rate $Q$:\n$$ G = -\\frac{8\\mu Q}{\\pi R^4} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$. The magnitude of the shear stress is given by $\\tau(r) = \\mu \\left| \\frac{dv}{dr} \\right|$. From our earlier derivation, the velocity gradient is:\n$$ \\frac{dv}{dr} = \\frac{Gr}{2\\mu} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $G$:\n$$ \\frac{dv}{dr} = \\left( -\\frac{8\\mu Q}{\\pi R^4} \\right) \\frac{r}{2\\mu} = -\\frac{4Qr}{\\pi R^4} $$\nThe shear stress as a function of radius is:\n$$ \\tau(r) = \\mu \\left| -\\frac{4Qr}{\\pi R^4} \\right| = \\frac{4\\mu Q r}{\\pi R^4} $$\nThe wall shear stress $\\tau_w$ is the value of $\\tau(r)$ at the wall, $r=R$:\n$$ \\tau_w = \\tau(R) = \\frac{4\\mu Q R}{\\pi R^4} $$\n$$ \\tau_w = \\frac{4\\mu Q}{\\pi R^3} $$\nThis is the required analytical expression for wall shear stress.\n\nFinally, we evaluate $\\tau_w$ using the provided numerical values:\n$\\mu = 3 \\times 10^{-3}$ Pa·s\n$Q = 1 \\times 10^{-9}$ m$^{3}$/s\n$R = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 50 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\tau_w$:\n$$ \\tau_w = \\frac{4 \\times (3 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}) \\times (1 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m^3/s})}{\\pi \\times (5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m})^3} $$\n$$ \\tau_w = \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot m^3}}{\\pi \\times 125 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{m^3}} $$\n$$ \\tau_w = \\frac{12}{\\pi \\times 125} \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = \\frac{12000}{125\\pi}\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = \\frac{96}{\\pi}\\,\\mathrm{Pa} $$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$ \\tau_w \\approx \\frac{96}{3.14159...} \\approx 30.5577...\\,\\mathrm{Pa} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we obtain the final answer.\n$$ \\tau_w \\approx 30.6\\,\\mathrm{Pa} $$\nThis result represents the magnitude of the tangential force per unit area exerted by the flowing blood on the endothelial cells lining the microvessel.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{30.6}$$", "id": "2627597"}]}
