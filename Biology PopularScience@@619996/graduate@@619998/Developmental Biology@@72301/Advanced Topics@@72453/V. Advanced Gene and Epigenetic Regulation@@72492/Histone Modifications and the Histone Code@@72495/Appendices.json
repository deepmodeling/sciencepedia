Consider a nucleosome whose histone tails collectively contain $N = 44$ lysine residues that are potential targets for acetylation. At physiological pH, each unmodified lysine contributes approximately $+1$ to the tail charge due to its protonated $\\varepsilon$-amino group. Acetylation neutralizes this positive charge, contributing $0$ at that site.

The charge values assigned to unmodified ($+1$) and acetylated ($0$) lysine are biochemically correct. The fact that $Q_{0} \\neq N$ is also realistic, as it correctly implies that residues other than the $N$ specified lysines contribute to the overall tail charge. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It specifies a probabilistic model (uniform and independent acetylation) and asks for the expected value of a system property (net charge). This is a standard problem in statistical mechanics and probability theory, which guarantees a unique and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe net charge of the histone tails, $Q$, can be expressed as the sum of the initial charge $Q_{0}$ and the total change in charge, $\\Delta Q$, resulting from acetylation.\n$$Q = Q_{0} + \\Delta Q$$\nAccording to the problem's explicit instruction, the change in charge contribution from a single lysine site upon acetylation is from $+1$ to $0$, which is a net change of $-1$. Let $K$ be the random variable representing the total number of lysine residues that are acetylated out of the $N$ available sites. Since each acetylation event reduces the total charge by $1$, the total change in charge is:\n$$\\Delta Q = K \\times (-1) = -K$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $Q$ gives:\n$$Q = Q_{0} - K$$\nWe are asked to find the expected net tail charge, $\\mathbb{E}[Q]$. By the linearity of the expectation operator:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[Q] = \\mathbb{E}[Q_{0} - K] = \\mathbb{E}[Q_{0}] - \\mathbb{E}[K]$$\nSince $Q_{0}$ is a given constant value, its expected value is the value itself: $\\mathbb{E}[Q_{0}] = Q_{0}$.\n$$\\mathbb{E}[Q] = Q_{0} - \\mathbb{E}[K]$$\nThe next step is to determine $\\mathbb{E}[K]$, the expected number of acetylated lysines. The problem states that acetylation occurs uniformly and independently at each of the $N$ sites, with a fraction $f$ of them being acetylated in a steady-state population. This is equivalent to stating that the probability of any given lysine site being acetylated is $p = f$.\n\nLet us define $N$ independent Bernoulli random variables, $X_{i}$ for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, N$, where $X_{i} = 1$ if the $i$-th lysine is acetylated and $X_{i} = 0$ if it is not. The probability of success (acetylation) is $P(X_{i} = 1) = f$.\nThe total number of acetylated lysines is the sum of these random variables:\n$$K = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_{i}$$\nThe expected value of $K$ is, by linearity of expectation:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[K] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_{i}\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbb{E}[X_{i}]$$\nThe expected value of a single Bernoulli variable $X_{i}$ is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X_{i}] = 1 \\cdot P(X_{i} = 1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_{i} = 0) = 1 \\cdot f + 0 \\cdot (1-f) = f$$\nTherefore, the expected total number of acetylated lysines is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[K] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} f = N \\cdot f$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\mathbb{E}[Q]$ yields the desired general formula:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[Q] = Q_{0} - Nf$$\nThis expression gives the expected net charge as a function of the initial charge $Q_{0}$, the number of sites $N$, and the fraction acetylated $f$.\n\nFinally, we must evaluate this expression for the given values: $Q_{0} = 36$, $N = 44$, and $f = 0.30$.\n$$\\mathbb{E}[Q] = 36 - (44)(0.30)$$\nThe calculation is straightforward:\n$$(44)(0.30) = 13.2$$\n$$\\mathbb{E}[Q] = 36 - 13.2 = 22.8$$\nThe expected net charge of the histone tails under the specified conditions is $22.8$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{22.8}$$", "id": "2821692"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the concept of charge alteration, this next exercise explores its functional impact on chromatin dynamics.

Unless the second term is extraordinarily large (which would correspond to a histone modification that almost entirely eliminates the unwrapping energy barrier), the product will also be much smaller than $1$. Therefore, it is a valid approximation to treat this product as negligible compared to $1$.

The formula for the logarithm of the Gaussian probability density function is:\n$$\n\\log P(x_j \\mid C) = \\log \\mathcal{N}(x_j \\mid \\mu_{C,j}, \\sigma^2_{C,j}) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2_{C,j}) - \\frac{(x_j - \\mu_{C,j})^2}{2\\sigma^2_{C,j}}\n$$\nA critical implementation detail is the handling of zero variances, which can occur if all training samples in a class have the same value for a feature. This would lead to division by zero or the logarithm of zero. To prevent this, a small regularization constant $\\epsilon = 10^{-6}$ is added to each estimated variance:\n$$\n\\sigma^2_{C,j, \\text{reg}} = \\sigma^2_{C,j} + \\epsilon\n$$\nThe final discriminant function to be maximized is:\n$$\ng_C(\\mathbf{x}) = \\log P(C) + \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{2} \\log(2\\pi \\sigma^2_{C,j, \\text{reg}}) - \\frac{(x_j - \\mu_{C,j})^2}{2 \\sigma^2_{C,j, \\text{reg}}} \\right]\n$$\nThe predicted class $\\hat{C}$ for a given $\\mathbf{x}$ is the class that yields the highest value for $g_C(\\mathbf{x})$. In case of a tie, the class with the smallest integer index is chosen.\n\nFinally, the performance of the classifier is evaluated using accuracy, defined as the fraction of correctly classified samples in the test set:\n$$\n\\text{accuracy} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{m} I(\\hat{y}_i = y_i)}{m}\n$$\nwhere $m$ is the number of test samples, $y_i$ is the true label, $\\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted label for the $i$-th test sample, and $I(\\cdot)$ is the indicator function.\n\nThe implementation will consist of a class that encapsulates this logic. A `fit` method will estimate the parameters from training data, and a `predict` method will use these parameters to classify new data points. We will process each test case by training the model on its corresponding training set and evaluating accuracy on its test set.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier and evaluates its accuracy\n    on three provided test cases related to chromatin state classification.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    class GaussianNaiveBayes:\n        \"\"\"\n        A Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier.\n\n        Parameters are estimated using Maximum Likelihood Estimation.\n        \"\"\"\n        def __init__(self, var_smoothing=1e-6):\n            self.var_smoothing = var_smoothing\n            self.class_priors_ = None\n            self.means_ = None\n            self.variances_ = None\n            self.classes_ = None\n\n        def fit(self, X, y):\n            \"\"\"\n            Train the classifier by estimating parameters from the data.\n\n            Args:\n                X (np.ndarray): Training data of shape (n_samples, n_features).\n                y (np.ndarray): Target values of shape (n_samples,).\n            \"\"\"\n            self.classes_ = np.unique(y)\n            n_samples, n_features = X.shape\n            n_classes = len(self.classes_)\n\n            self.means_ = np.zeros((n_classes, n_features))\n            self.variances_ = np.zeros((n_classes, n_features))\n            self.class_priors_ = np.zeros(n_classes)\n\n            for idx, c in enumerate(self.classes_):\n                X_c = X[y == c]\n                self.means_[idx, :] = X_c.mean(axis=0)\n                self.variances_[idx, :] = X_c.var(axis=0)\n                self.class_priors_[idx] = X_c.shape[0] / float(n_samples)\n\n        def predict(self, X):\n            \"\"\"\n            Perform classification on an array of test vectors X.\n\n            Args:\n                X (np.ndarray): Test data of shape (n_samples, n_features).\n\n            Returns:\n                np.ndarray: Predicted class labels for each sample in X.\n            \"\"\"\n            # Add variance smoothing for numerical stability\n            vars_reg = self.variances_ + self.var_smoothing\n\n            log_priors = np.log(self.class_priors_)\n\n            # The log posterior is proportional to log_prior + log_likelihood\n            # log_likelihood for a Gaussian is sum over features of:\n            # -0.5 * log(2*pi*var) -
