It is scientifically sound, well-posed, completely specified for the question asked, and objective. It is noted that the mass fractions of C, H, N, and O, as well as the molar mass of the phosphate monoester group, are superfluous for the calculation requested. However, the presence of extraneous information does not invalidate a problem; it merely tests the ability to identify the relevant parameters.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to find the molar content of phosphate monoester groups, which we will denote as $C_{\\text{Phos}}$, in the EPS sample. This quantity is defined as the amount of substance (moles) of phosphate monoester groups, $n_{\\text{Phos}}$, per unit mass of the EPS sample, $m_{\\text{EPS}}$.\n$$C_{\\text{Phos}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{Phos}}}{m_{\\text{EPS}}}$$\nWe begin by considering an arbitrary mass of the EPS sample, $m_{\\text{EPS}}$.\n\nAccording to the definition of mass fraction, the mass of phosphorus, $m_{\\mathrm{P}}$, in this sample is given by the product of its mass fraction, $w_{\\mathrm{P}}$, and the total mass of the sample.\n$$m_{\\mathrm{P}} = w_{\\mathrm{P}} \\cdot m_{\\text{EPS}}$$\nThe problem states that the mass fraction of phosphorus is $w_{\\mathrm{P}} = 2\\%$, which is equivalent to the dimensionless value $0.02$.\n$$m_{\\mathrm{P}} = 0.02 \\cdot m_{\\text{EPS}}$$\nNext, we convert the mass of phosphorus to the amount of substance of phosphorus, $n_{\\mathrm{P}}$, using its molar mass, $M_{\\mathrm{P}}$. The definition of amount of substance is the ratio of mass to molar mass.\n$$n_{\\mathrm{P}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{P}}}{M_{\\mathrm{P}}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $m_{\\mathrm{P}}$:\n$$n_{\\mathrm{P}} = \\frac{0.02 \\cdot m_{\\text{EPS}}}{M_{\\mathrm{P}}}$$\nThe problem provides a crucial stoichiometric constraint: each phosphate monoester group contains exactly one phosphorus atom. Therefore, the amount of substance of phosphate monoester groups, $n_{\\text{Phos}}$, must be equal to the amount of substance of phosphorus atoms, $n_{\\mathrm{P}}$.\n$$n_{\\text{Phos}} = n_{\\mathrm{P}}$$\nThis establishes the direct relationship between the elemental mass fraction and the number of functional groups, as requested. We can now write the amount of phosphate groups as:\n$$n_{\\text{Phos}} = \\frac{0.02 \\cdot m_{\\text{EPS}}}{M_{\\mathrm{P}}}$$\nWe can now calculate the molar content, $C_{\\text{Phos}}$, by substituting this expression into its definition:\n$$C_{\\text{Phos}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{Phos}}}{m_{\\text{EPS}}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{0.02 \\cdot m_{\\text{EPS}}}{M_{\\mathrm{P}}} \\right)}{m_{\\text{EPS}}}$$\nThe term for the total sample mass, $m_{\\text{EPS}}$, cancels, as one would expect for an intensive property like molar content.\n$$C_{\\text{Phos}} = \\frac{0.02}{M_{\\mathrm{P}}}$$\nThis result shows that the molar content of the phosphate groups is determined solely by the mass fraction of phosphorus and its molar mass. We substitute the given value $M_{\\mathrm{P}} = 30.97\\ \\mathrm{g\\ mol^{-1}}$.\n$$C_{\\text{Phos}} = \\frac{0.02}{30.97\\ \\mathrm{g\\ mol^{-1}}} \\approx 6.45786 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ g^{-1}}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in millimoles per gram ($\\mathrm{mmol\\ g^{-1}}$).

This practice problem delves into the physicochemical principles governing this behavior by focusing on the titratable functional groups within the EPS, such as carboxylates. You will use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, a cornerstone of acid-base chemistry, to calculate how the charge state of these groups changes with pH, and in doing so, quantify the impact on the matrix's fixed-charge density, which drives Donnan swelling and ion-exchange phenomena [@problem_id:2492419].", "problem": "Extracellular polymeric substances in biofilm matrices contain weak-acid functionalities, notably carboxyl groups from uronic acids, that titrate with environmental pH and thereby control the matrix fixed-charge density, Donnan partitioning, and swelling.

Increasing $pH$ above $pK_a$ drives deprotonation, increasing $\\alpha$ and thus the fixed charge density. Under monovalent, low-ionic-strength conditions, a higher fixed charge density increases the Donnan potential magnitude between the gel phase and the surrounding solution. This elevates the counterion concentration inside the matrix relative to the bath, enhancing counterion osmotic pressure and electrostatic repulsion along the polymer network. The net effect is an increase in swelling (larger solvent uptake) and an increase in cation-exchange capacity, as more negative sites are available to bind and exchange cations. Quantitatively, the change from $pH = 5$ to $pH = 7$ at $pK_a = 3.5$ raises $\\alpha$ by a factor $R \\approx 1.031$, meaning the matrix is already highly deprotonated at $pH = 5$ and becomes only slightly more charged by $pH = 7$. Consequently, the incremental increases in Donnan-driven swelling and cation-exchange capacity are modest over this pH range. The sensitivity would be much greater near $pH \\approx pK_a$, where $\\alpha$ changes steeply with $pH$. In environments containing multivalent cations (for example, $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$), increased deprotonation also promotes stronger ionic cross-bridging, which can counteract Donnan swelling; however, under the stated monovalent, low-ionic-strength conditions, the dominant effect of increased $\\alpha$ is enhanced swelling and ion exchange.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.031}$$", "id": "2492419"}, {"introduction": "Beyond its chemical makeup, the physical architecture of the biofilm matrix is a critical determinant of its function, particularly its role as a transport barrier.

The macroscopic concentration gradient is therefore $\\frac{\\Delta C}{L}$. The definition of tortuosity, $\\tau$, states that the average microscopic path length for a molecule to traverse the macroscopic thickness $L$ is $\\tau L$.
