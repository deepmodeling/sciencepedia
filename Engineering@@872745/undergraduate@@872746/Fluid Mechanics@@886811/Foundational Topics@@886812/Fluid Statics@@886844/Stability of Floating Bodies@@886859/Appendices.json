Hydrostatic equilibrium for floating bodies gives $V=\\frac{1}{2}V_{\\text{tot}}$, where $V$ is the displaced volume and $V_{\\text{tot}}$ is the total volume.\n\nThe metacentric height is $GM=BM-BG$, where $BM=\\frac{I_{\\text{wp}}}{V}$ with $I_{\\text{wp}}$ the second moment of area of the waterplane about the heeling axis, and $BG$ is the distance between the centers of buoyancy $B$ and gravity $G$ in equilibrium.\n\nVertical configuration (axis vertical).
