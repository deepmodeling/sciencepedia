Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $C_1, C_3, x_0$, and $y_0$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the magnitude of the acceleration of a fluid particle under a steady-flow condition derived from an initially unsteady velocity field.\n\nFirst, we must establish the condition under which the flow becomes steady. A flow is defined as steady if its velocity field does not change with time at any given point in space. Mathematically, this means the partial derivative of the velocity vector with respect to time must be zero everywhere in the flow field:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\vec{V}}{\\partial t} = \\vec{0} $$\nThe given velocity field is $\\vec{V}(x, y, t) = (C_1 x + C_2 \\cos(\\omega t)) \\hat{i} + (C_3 y) \\hat{j}$. We compute its partial derivative with respect to time, holding the spatial coordinates $x$ and $y$ constant:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\vec{V}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left[ (C_1 x + C_2 \\cos(\\omega t)) \\hat{i} + (C_3 y) \\hat{j} \\right] $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\vec{V}}{\\partial t} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (C_1 x + C_2 \\cos(\\omega t)) \\right) \\hat{i} + \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (C_3 y) \\right) \\hat{j} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\vec{V}}{\\partial t} = (0 - C_2 \\omega \\sin(\\omega t)) \\hat{i} + (0) \\hat{j} = -C_2 \\omega \\sin(\\omega t) \\hat{i} $$\nFor the flow to be steady, this expression must be equal to the zero vector for all values of time $t$. Since the constants $\\omega$ and the function $\\sin(\\omega t)$ are not identically zero, the only way for the expression $-C_2 \\omega \\sin(\\omega t) \\hat{i}$ to be zero for all $t$ is if the constant $C_2$ is equal to zero. This is the \"steady-flow condition\" mentioned in the problem.\n\nWith $C_2 = 0$, the velocity field under the steady condition becomes:\n$$ \\vec{V}_{\\text{steady}}(x, y) = (C_1 x) \\hat{i} + (C_3 y) \\hat{j} $$\nLet's denote the components of this steady velocity field as $u(x, y) = C_1 x$ and $v(x, y) = C_3 y$.\n\nNext, we calculate the acceleration of a fluid particle.

Thus, the acceleration is purely convective:\n$$ \\vec{a} = (\\vec{V} \\cdot \\nabla)\\vec{V} $$\nIn two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates, the components of the acceleration vector are:\n$$ a_x = u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} $$\n$$ a_y = u \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} $$\nWe need to find the partial derivatives of the steady velocity components $u = C_1 x$ and $v = C_3 y$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = C_1, \\quad \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = C_3 $$\nNow, we substitute these derivatives into the expressions for the acceleration components:\n$$ a_x = (C_1 x)(C_1) + (C_3 y)(0) = C_1^2 x $$\n$$ a_y = (C_1 x)(0) + (C_3 y)(C_3) = C_3^2 y $$\nThe acceleration vector at any point $(x, y)$ is therefore $\\vec{a}(x, y) = (C_1^2 x) \\hat{i} + (C_3^2 y) \\hat{j}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of this acceleration at the specific point $(x_0, y_0)$. First, we evaluate the acceleration vector at this point:\n$$ \\vec{a}(x_0, y_0) = (C_1^2 x_0) \\hat{i} + (C_3^2 y_0) \\hat{j} $$\nThe magnitude of this vector is found using the Pythagorean theorem, $|\\vec{a}| = \\sqrt{a_x^2 + a_y^2}$:\n$$ |\\vec{a}(x_0, y_0)| = \\sqrt{(C_1^2 x_0)^2 + (C_3^2 y_0)^2} $$\n$$ |\\vec{a}(x_0, y_0)| = \\sqrt{C_1^4 x_0^2 + C_3^4 y_0^2} $$\nThis is the final symbolic expression for the magnitude of the acceleration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{C_1^{4} x_0^{2} + C_3^{4} y_0^{2}}}$$", "id": "1793178"}, {"introduction": "Having distinguished between local and convective acceleration, we can now tackle a more general scenario: a truly unsteady flow.
