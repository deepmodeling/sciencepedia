In such a scenario, even if the flow is steady (meaning the velocity at any fixed point does not change over time), a fluid parcel must accelerate or decelerate as it moves from a region of one velocity to another. This problem, analyzing a river widening as it enters a lake, provides a classic exercise in calculating this \"convective acceleration\" by combining the principle of mass conservation with the definition of acceleration for a steady flow [@problem_id:1808871].", "problem": "A large, slow-moving river discharges into a vast, quiescent lake. To model this transition, we consider a simplified one-dimensional, steady, incompressible flow. The river channel is approximated as having a rectangular cross-section with a constant depth. At a reference point `x = 0`, the river has a width `W_0 = 60.0` m and a uniform flow velocity of `u_0 = 2.50` m/s. As the river flows into the lake, for `x > 0`, the banks diverge, causing the width of the channel to increase linearly with distance according to the function `W(x) = W_0 + \\alpha x`, where `\\alpha = 0.150` is a dimensionless widening coefficient.
