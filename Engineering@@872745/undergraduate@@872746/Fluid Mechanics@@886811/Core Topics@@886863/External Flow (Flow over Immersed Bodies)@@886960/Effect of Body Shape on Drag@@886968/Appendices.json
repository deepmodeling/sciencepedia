The only horizontal force acting on the projectiles is aerodynamic drag.\n\nAccording to Newton's second law, the net force on an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration ($F_{\\text{net}} = ma$). In this case, the net horizontal force is the drag force, $F_D$. Therefore, the magnitude of the horizontal acceleration for each projectile is given by $|a| = \\frac{F_D}{m}$.\n\nThe magnitude of the aerodynamic drag force is given by the equation:\n$$F_D = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v^2 C_D A$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density of the fluid (air), $v$ is the velocity of the object relative to the fluid, $C_D$ is the drag coefficient, and $A$ is the reference cross-sectional area perpendicular to the direction of motion.\n\nLet's write the expression for the magnitude of the initial deceleration for each projectile. We will use the subscript $S$ for the sphere and $P$ for the prolate spheroid (shell). The initial velocity for both is $v_0$.\n\nFor the spherical cannonball:\n$$|a_S| = \\frac{F_{D,S}}{m_S} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_0^2 C_{D,S} A_S}{m_S}$$\n\nFor the streamlined shell:\n$$|a_P| = \\frac{F_{D,P}}{m_P} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_0^2 C_{D,P} A_P}{m_P}$$\n\nWe need to find the ratio $\\frac{|a_S|}{|a_P|}$.\n$$ \\frac{|a_S|}{|a_P|} = \\frac{\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_0^2 C_{D,S} A_S}{m_S}}{\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_0^2 C_{D,P} A_P}{m_P}} $$\n\nWe can simplify this expression. The projectiles are fired under identical conditions, so the air density $\\rho$ is the same for both. They are fired with the same initial velocity, so $v_0$ is the same for both. The problem states they have the same maximum diameter, which means their reference cross-sectional areas, $A_S$ and $A_P$, are equal. The term $\\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_0^2 A$ is therefore common to both the numerator and the denominator and cancels out.\n\nThe simplified ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{|a_S|}{|a_P|} = \\frac{\\frac{C_{D,S}}{m_S}}{\\frac{C_{D,P}}{m_P}} $$\nThis can be rearranged to:\n$$ \\frac{|a_S|}{|a_P|} = \\frac{C_{D,S}}{C_{D,P}} \\times \\frac{m_P}{m_S} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n$m_S = 43.5 \\text{ kg}$\n$m_P = 50.0 \\text{ kg}$\n$C_{D,S} = 0.47$\n$C_{D,P} = 0.12$\n\n$$ \\frac{|a_S|}{|a_P|} = \\frac{0.47}{0.12} \\times \\frac{50.0 \\text{ kg}}{43.5 \\text{ kg}} $$\n\nLet's calculate the value:\n$$ \\frac{|a_S|}{|a_P|} = \\left(\\frac{0.47}{0.12}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{50.0}{43.5}\\right) \\approx (3.91667) \\times (1.14943) \\approx 4.50193 $$\n\nThe problem asks to round the final answer to three significant figures.\n$$ \\frac{|a_S|}{|a_P|} \\approx 4.50 $$\nThis result shows that the initial deceleration of the unstreamlined cannonball is 4.50 times greater than that of the heavier, but much more aerodynamically efficient, streamlined shell.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.50}$$", "id": "1750771"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basic concept of streamlining, this next practice delves into a more nuanced, real-world engineering scenario: reducing the drag on a semi-truck.
