A single, seemingly simple system can involve multiple types of interfaces, each governed by different physical laws. This first practice challenges you to dissect a common scenario—a water droplet on a surface—to correctly identify the boundary conditions at the liquid-solid, liquid-gas, and three-phase contact line, reinforcing the connection between physical principles and their mathematical representation [@problem_id:1737712].", "problem": "A small, stationary droplet of water with density $\\rho$ and dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ rests in equilibrium on a perfectly flat, horizontal sheet of Teflon in quiescent, ambient air. We are interested in the physical boundary conditions that govern this static fluid system.

Let $\\sigma$ be the surface tension coefficient for the water-air interface, and $\\kappa$ be the mean curvature of this interface.\n\nThe system has three distinct boundaries:\n1.  The **liquid-gas interface**: The curved surface where the water droplet is in contact with the air.\n2.  The **liquid-solid interface**: The flat circular area where the water droplet is in contact with the Teflon sheet.\n3.  The **three-phase contact line**: The circular line where the water, air, and Teflon sheet all meet. The static contact angle at this line is denoted by $\\theta_c$.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete set of boundary conditions for this system?\n\nA. At the liquid-gas interface, $\\vec{v} = 0$. At the liquid-solid interface, the tangential component of velocity is zero, but the normal component is non-zero to allow for evaporation. At the contact line, the contact angle $\\theta_c$ is always 90 degrees.\n\nB.

At the contact line, the contact angle $\\theta_c$ is determined by the fluid's viscosity.\n\nD. At the liquid-gas interface, both normal and tangential stresses are zero.
