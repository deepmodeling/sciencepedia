We will calculate the expression for each volumetric flow rate separately and then find their ratio.\n\nFirst, we determine the volumetric flow rate using the ideal fluid model, $Q_{ideal}$. This model is based on Bernoulli's equation, which relates pressure, velocity, and height between two points in a moving fluid. Let point 1 be inside the main body of the bottle and point 2 be at the exit of the nozzle.
