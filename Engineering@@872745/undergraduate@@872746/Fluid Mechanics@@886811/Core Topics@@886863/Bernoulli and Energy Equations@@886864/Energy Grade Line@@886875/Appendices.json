The problem description specifies:\n1) an initial linear decrease with constant negative slope (distributed friction in a fully developed, constant-diameter horizontal pipe),\n2) an instantaneous, significant vertical drop (a localized extraction of energy or a minor loss modeled as a point drop), and\n3) a final linear decrease with the same slope as the initial segment (implying the downstream pipe section has the same $v$ and $D$, hence the same $S_f=\\frac{f v^{2}}{2g D}$, as the upstream section).\n\nEvaluate the options:\n\n- A. Constant-diameter pipe, then a turbine, then the same-diameter pipe. A turbine extracts energy, producing a discrete EGL drop $h_{t}0$. Because the upstream and downstream pipes have the same diameter and flow rate, $v$ is the same in both, and with comparable roughness and Reynolds number, the slope in each constant-diameter, fully developed section is\n$$S_f=\\frac{f v^{2}}{2g D},$$\nidentical before and after the turbine. This matches all three features: linear decrease, vertical drop (energy extraction), linear decrease with identical slope.\n\n- B. Constant-diameter pipe, then a pump, then same-diameter pipe. A pump adds energy, so the EGL exhibits a vertical rise $h_{p}0$, not a drop. This contradicts the observed vertical drop.\n\n- C. Sudden expansion to a larger diameter. A sudden expansion causes a localized energy loss (EGL drop) at the discontinuity, but the downstream slope changes because\n$$S_{f,1}=\\frac{f_{1} v_{1}^{2}}{2g D_{1}},\\quad S_{f,2}=\\fracf_{2} v_{2}^{2}}{2g D_{2}},\\quad v_{2}=v_{1}\\left(\\frac{D_{1}}{D_{2}}\\right)^{2},$$\nso generally\n$$S_{f,2}=\\frac{f_{2}}{2g}\\frac{v_{1}^{2}}{D_{2}}\\left(\\frac{D_{1}}{D_{2}}\\right)^{4}\\neq \\frac{f_{1} v_{1}^{2}}{2g D_{1}}=S_{f,1}$$\nfor $D_{2}\\neq D_{1}$.

The EGL is a single straight line with no instantaneous drops, contradicting the observed discrete drop.\n\n- E. Pipe between high- and low-pressure tanks with a Venturi meter at the midpoint. Upstream and downstream constant-diameter sections would indeed have equal slopes, but a Venturi features area changes over a finite length with velocity variation, so the EGL across it is not a single instantaneous vertical drop at one point; rather, it changes through the converging and diffuser sections with a net minor loss. The description of a single, instantaneous, significant vertical drop at a specific point is most consistent with a discrete energy-extracting device (turbine) idealized as negligible length, not with a Venturi whose losses are distributed over its finite length and typically small.\n\nTherefore, the system most consistent with the described EGL is a turbine between equal-diameter pipe segments.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1753257"}, {"introduction": "Fluid systems often operate under changing conditions.

The EGL will remain in its initial position, as the change in potential energy is fully converted to kinetic energy.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine how the Energy Grade Line (EGL) of a gravity-fed pipe system changes as the water level in the source reservoir decreases.\n\nFirst, let's define the Energy Grade Line. The EGL represents the total mechanical energy head of the fluid at any point in the system. It is the sum of the elevation head ($z$), the pressure head ($\\frac{p}{\\rho g}$), and the velocity head ($\\frac{v^2}{2g}$), where $\\rho$ is the fluid density.\n\n$$EGL = z + \\frac{p}{\\rho g} + \\frac{v^2}{2g}$$\n\nTo analyze the system, we apply the steady-state energy equation between the free surface of the reservoir (point 1) and the free discharge outlet of the pipe (point 2).\n\n$$z_1 + \\frac{p_1}{\\rho g} + \\frac{v_1^2}{2g} = z_2 + \\frac{p_2}{\\rho g} + \\frac{v_2^2}{2g} + h_L$$\n\nHere, $h_L$ represents the total head loss in the pipe. Let's analyze the terms at points 1 and 2.\n\nAt point 1 (reservoir surface):\n- The reservoir is large, so the velocity of the free surface is negligible, $v_1 \\approx 0$.\n- The reservoir is open to the atmosphere, so the pressure is atmospheric, $p_1 = p_{atm}$. Using gauge pressure, $p_{1,gauge} = 0$.\n- The elevation is $z_1$.\n\nAt point 2 (pipe outlet):\n- The pipe discharges into the atmosphere, so the pressure is atmospheric, $p_2 = p_{atm}$. Using gauge pressure, $p_{2,gauge} = 0$.\n- The fluid is moving with a velocity $v_2$ just as it exits the pipe.\n- The elevation is $z_2$.\n\nThe head loss, $h_L$, is primarily due to friction in the pipe (major loss). For a pipe of constant diameter, the velocity $v$ is constant along its length, so $v = v_2$. The major head loss is given by the Darcy-Weisbach equation:\n$$h_L = f \\frac{L}{D} \\frac{v_2^2}{2g}$$\n\nSubstituting these conditions into the energy equation:\n$$z_1 + 0 + 0 = z_2 + 0 + \\frac{v_2^2}{2g} + f \\frac{L}{D} \\frac{v_2^2}{2g}$$\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the driving head, $z_1 - z_2$:\n$$z_1 - z_2 = \\frac{v_2^2}{2g} \\left(1 + f \\frac{L}{D}\\right)$$\n\nNow, let's analyze the effect of the decreasing reservoir level, $z_1$. The problem states that $z_1$ steadily decreases. From the equation above, the driving head ($z_1 - z_2$) decreases. Since $g$, $f$, $L$, and $D$ are constants, for the equality to hold, the flow velocity $v_2$ must also decrease.\n\nWith this understanding, we can analyze the characteristics of the EGL:\n\n1.  **Position of the EGL:** The EGL starts at the elevation of the total head at the beginning of the pipe. The total head in the reservoir is $z_1$. Thus, the EGL begins at an elevation just below $z_1$ (accounting for a minor entrance loss, but its position is fundamentally tied to $z_1$). As $z_1$ decreases, the entire energy budget of the system decreases, so the starting point of the EGL must also shift downwards.\n\n2.  **Slope of the EGL:** The slope of the EGL is a measure of the head loss per unit length. For a pipe of constant diameter where major losses dominate, the EGL has a nearly constant downward slope. The magnitude of this slope is given by $\\frac{h_L}{L}$.\n    $$\\text{Slope magnitude} = \\frac{h_L}{L} = \\frac{1}{L} \\left(f \\frac{L}{D} \\frac{v^2}{2g}\\right) = f \\frac{v^2}{2gD}$$\n    As we established, the velocity $v$ (which is equal to $v_2$) decreases as the reservoir level $z_1$ drops. Since the slope's magnitude is proportional to $v^2$, a decrease in $v$ will cause the slope to become smaller. A smaller slope means the EGL becomes less steep, or flatter (closer to horizontal).\n\nCombining these two findings:\n- The EGL shifts downwards because its starting point is determined by the decreasing reservoir level $z_1$.\n- The slope of the EGL becomes less steep because the decreasing flow velocity $v$ results in lower frictional head losses per unit length.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\nA. The EGL will shift downwards, and its slope will become less steep (i.e., closer to horizontal). - This matches our conclusion.\nB. The EGL will shift downwards, but its slope will remain constant. - Incorrect. The slope changes because the velocity changes.\nC. The starting point of the EGL at the pipe entrance will drop, but the endpoint at the pipe outlet will remain at a fixed elevation. - Incorrect. The elevation of the EGL at the outlet is $z_2 + \\frac{v_2^2}{2g}$. Since $v_2$ decreases, this elevation also drops.\nD. The EGL will shift downwards, and its slope will become steeper. - Incorrect. A steeper slope would imply higher head loss and higher velocity, which is the opposite of what happens.\nE. The EGL will remain in its initial position... - Incorrect. The total energy of the system is decreasing.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that the EGL shifts downwards and its slope becomes less steep.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1753269"}]}
