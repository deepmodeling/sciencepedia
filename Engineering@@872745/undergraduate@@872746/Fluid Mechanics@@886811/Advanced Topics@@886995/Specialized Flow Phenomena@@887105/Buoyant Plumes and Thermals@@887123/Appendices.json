This ejection creates a turbulent buoyant plume that rises vertically. We can model this phenomenon as a 'simple plume' originating from a virtual point source, where the initial momentum of the fluid is negligible compared to the momentum generated by buoyancy over the plume's height.\n\nThe flow can be analyzed using a simplified model based on integral conservation laws. We assume 'top-hat' profiles, where the vertical velocity $w$ and reduced gravity $g'$ are uniform across the plume's circular cross-section of radius $R$ and are zero outside this radius. The governing principles for this model are:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Vertical Momentum**: The rate of change with height $z$ of the plume's vertical momentum flux, defined as $M = \\pi R^2 w^2$, is equal to the local integrated buoyancy force, defined as $B = \\pi R^2 g'$. This is expressed as $\\frac{dM}{dz} = B$.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Buoyancy**: The buoyancy flux, defined as $F = \\pi R^2 w g'$, is constant with height. We denote this constant value by $F_0$.\n\n3.  **Entrainment Assumption**: Turbulent plumes entrain surrounding fluid, causing them to widen.
