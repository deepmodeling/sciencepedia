The conical stem is attached to the top face of the cylinder. The base of the cone has the same radius as the cylinder, $R_c$, and the cone tapers to a point over a height $H_s$.\n\nThe hydrometer is placed in a tank containing a fluid of unknown density $\\rho$. It orients itself vertically and floats in static equilibrium. It is observed that the entire cylindrical body is submerged, and the conical stem is partially submerged.
