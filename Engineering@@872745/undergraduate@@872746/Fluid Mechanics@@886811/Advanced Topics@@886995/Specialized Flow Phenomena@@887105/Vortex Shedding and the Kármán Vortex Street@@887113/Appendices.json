The installation consists of numerous vertical cylindrical steel rods of varying diameters, intended to \"sing\" when the wind blows. The sound is generated by a phenomenon where the wind flow separates from the rod, creating alternating low-pressure vortices on each side. The frequency of this vortex shedding, $f$, determines the pitch of the sound produced. This frequency is related to the free-stream wind velocity, $U$, and the rod's diameter, $D$, through a dimensionless quantity called the Strouhal number, $St$, given by the relation $St = \\frac{fD}{U}$.\n\nFor a particular rod in the installation with a diameter of $D = 5.00$ cm, a steady wind blows perpendicularly against it with a speed of $U = 22.0$ m/s. The flow conditions are such that the Strouhal number is $St = 0.210$.\n\nThe musical pitch of a note is determined by its frequency. The relationship between the frequency, $f$, of a note and its position on the musical scale relative to a reference note can be described by the formula $f = f_{ref} \\cdot 2^{n/12}$, where $f_{ref}$ is the frequency of the reference note and $n$ is the number of semitones the note is away from the reference.
