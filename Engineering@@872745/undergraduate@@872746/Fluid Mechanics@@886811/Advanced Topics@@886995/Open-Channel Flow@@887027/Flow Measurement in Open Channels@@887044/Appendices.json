The theoretical volumetric flow rate, or discharge ($Q$), over this type of weir is accurately described by the relationship $Q = C H^{3/2}$, where $H$ represents the head (the height of the water surface upstream from the weir, measured relative to the crest of the weir) and $C$ is a constant coefficient that depends on the weir's geometry and the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nDuring a dry spell, the engineer records an initial head $H_1$ and a corresponding discharge $Q_1$. Following a period of significant rainfall, the water level rises, and the new head is measured to be exactly double the initial head, such that $H_2 = 2H_1$. Assuming the velocity of approach is negligible and the flow conditions remain within the valid range for the given discharge equation, determine the factor by which the discharge has increased.

While the rectangular weir is useful, the V-notch (or triangular) weir offers distinct advantages, particularly for measuring low flow rates. This practice introduces the concept of *relative sensitivity*, a metric that quantifies how responsive a weir's head is to changes in discharge. By comparing the relative sensitivity of a V-notch weir to a rectangular weir, you will uncover the mathematical reason for its superior performance in low-flow applications.", "problem": "An engineer is designing a flow measurement system for a small open channel, where accurate measurement of very low flow rates is critical. The choice is between a standard suppressed rectangular weir and a 90-degree V-notch weir. A key performance metric for low-flow measurement is the *relative sensitivity* of the weir, defined as the fractional change in discharge ($Q$) for a given change in the upstream head ($H$). Mathematically, this is expressed as $\\frac{1}{Q}\\frac{dQ}{dH}$. A higher relative sensitivity indicates that a small change in flow rate causes a larger, more easily detectable change in head, which is desirable.\n\nThe theoretical equations for the discharge over these weirs are given as:\n1.  For the rectangular weir: $Q_R = C_{dR} \\frac{2}{3} \\sqrt{2g} L H^{3/2}$, where $L$ is the crest length.\n2.
