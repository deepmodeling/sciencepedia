For a rectangular channel with bottom width $b_1$ and flow depth $y_1$, the cross-sectional area $A$ and wetted perimeter $P_1$ are given by:\n$$A = b_1 y_1$$\n$$P_1 = b_1 + 2y_1$$\nThe problem states that for Design 1, the aspect ratio is $y_1/b_1 = 0.25$, which means $y_1 = 0.25 b_1$.

From the area equation, $b_2 = A/y_2$. Substituting this into the perimeter equation:\n$$P_2(y_2) = \\frac{A}{y_2} + 2y_2$$\nTo find the minimum perimeter, we take the derivative of $P_2$ with respect to $y_2$ and set it to zero:\n$$\\frac{dP_2}{dy_2} = -\\frac{A}{y_2^{2}} + 2$$\nSetting the derivative to zero:\n$$-\\frac{A}{y_2^{2}} + 2 = 0 \\implies 2 = \\frac{A}{y_2^{2}} \\implies A = 2y_2^{2}$$\nThis is the condition on the area and depth for the best hydraulic section.
