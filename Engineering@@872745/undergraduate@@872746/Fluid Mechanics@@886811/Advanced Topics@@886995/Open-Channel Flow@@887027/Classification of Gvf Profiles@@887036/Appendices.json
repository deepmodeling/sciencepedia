Calculate Hydraulic Parameters and Classify Slopes:**\nFirst, calculate the discharge per unit width, $q = Q/b = 20/5 = 4.0 \\text{ m}^2/\\text{s}$.\nThe critical depth is constant: $y_c = (q^2/g)^{1/3} = (4.0^2/9.81)^{1/3} \\approx 1.18 \\text{ m}$.\nUsing the wide channel approximation with Manning's formula, calculate the normal depths:\n- Section 1 (steeper, $S_{0,1}=0.008$): $y_{n1} \\approx 0.787 \\text{ m}$. Since $y_{n1} < y_c$, this is a **Steep (S)** slope.\n- Section 2 (milder, $S_{0,2}=0.001$): $y_{n2} \\approx 1.469 \\text{ m}$. Since $y_{n2} > y_c$, this is a **Mild (M)** slope.\n\n**2. Analyze the Flow Transition:**\nThe flow transitions from supercritical on a steep slope to subcritical on a mild slope, which requires a hydraulic jump. The subcritical flow on the long mild section acts as a downstream control. However, in supercritical flow, controls only propagate downstream. The influence of the downstream subcritical condition is felt via the location of the hydraulic jump.\n\nStandard analysis shows that if the downstream normal depth ($y_{n2}$) is less than the depth needed to force a jump from the upstream normal depth ($y_{n1}$), the jump will occur on the downstream (mild) slope. Here, the required depth (sequent depth to $y_{n1}$) is approximately 1.68 m, which is greater than $y_{n2} \\approx 1.47$ m. Thus, the jump occurs on the mild slope.\n\n**3. Identify the GVF Profile:**\nSince the jump occurs downstream of the slope change, the flow on the steep section remains supercritical. The characteristic profile for flow accelerating down a long steep channel from an upstream control (e.g., a reservoir where flow starts at $y_c$) is a drawdown curve that approaches $y_{n1}$. This profile is defined by depths in Zone 2 ($y_{n1} < y < y_c$). This is an **S2 profile**.\n\nTherefore, the profile in the first section just upstream of the slope change is an S2 profile.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1742375"}]}
