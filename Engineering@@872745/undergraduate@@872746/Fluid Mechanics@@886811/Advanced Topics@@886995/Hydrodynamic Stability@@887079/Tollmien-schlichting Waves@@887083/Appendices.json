This exercise [@problem_id:1806722] explores one of the most fundamental principles of hydrodynamic stability: Rayleigh's inflection-point theorem. By analyzing the curvature of two different velocity profiles, you will see firsthand why some flows are inherently resistant to infinitesimal disturbances, offering a clear reason why the classic Hagen-Poiseuille flow in a pipe is predicted to be linearly stable.", "problem": "In the study of fluid mechanics, the transition from smooth, layered (laminar) flow to chaotic, swirling (turbulent) flow is a phenomenon of great importance. Linear stability theory provides a mathematical framework for predicting the onset of this transition by analyzing the growth of infinitesimal disturbances in a base flow. For many boundary layer flows, this transition is initiated by the amplification of specific wave-like disturbances known as Tollmien-Schlichting waves. A key insight from this theory, often summarized by Rayleigh's and Fjørtoft's criteria, links the stability of a flow to the shape of its velocity profile.\n\nConsider a fully developed, incompressible, viscous flow in a cylindrical pipe of radius $R$. The fluid velocity is purely in the axial direction and varies only with the radial position $r$ from the centerline. Two possible velocity profiles, $U(r)$, are proposed:\n\n**Profile A (Hagen-Poiseuille Flow):**\n$$U_A(r) = V_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{r^2}{R^2}\\right)$$\n\n**Profile B (A Modified 'Blunter' Flow):**\n$$U_B(r) = V_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{r^2}{R^2}\\right)^2$$\n\nHere, $V_0$ is the maximum velocity at the centerline ($r=0$) for both profiles, and the flow is defined for the domain $0 \\le r \\le R$.\n\nBased on an analysis of the shapes of these velocity profiles, specifically the presence or absence of inflection points (locations where the second spatial derivative of the velocity profile is zero), which of the following statements correctly identifies the profile predicted to be stable to all infinitesimal disturbances according to linear stability theory, and provides the correct reason?\n\nA.

Profile A is stable because it has no inflection points within the flow domain $0  r  R$.\nD. Profile B is stable because it has an inflection point at $r = R/\\sqrt{3}$.\nE. Both profiles are inherently unstable because all shear flows are susceptible to Tollmien-Schlichting waves.", "solution": "We are asked to use the presence or absence of inflection points in the axial velocity profiles to infer stability under linear (inviscid) theory, guided by Rayleigh’s inflection-point theorem (and Fjørtoft’s refinement). Rayleigh’s theorem states that a necessary condition for inviscid instability of a parallel shear flow is the existence of an inflection point in the base velocity profile within the flow domain. Therefore, a profile with no inflection points in the domain is predicted (by this criterion) to be stable to all infinitesimal disturbances.\n\nCompute the second derivatives to locate inflection points.\n\nFor Profile A:\n$$U_{A}(r)=V_{0}\\left(1-\\frac{r^{2}}{R^{2}}\\right),$$\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}U_{A}}{\\mathrm{d}r}=-\\frac{2V_{0}}{R^{2}}\\,r,\\qquad \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}U_{A}}{\\mathrm{d}r^{2}}=-\\frac{2V_{0}}{R^{2}}.$$\nThe second derivative is a constant, strictly negative for all $0\\le r\\le R$, hence it never vanishes in $0rR$.

Hence Profile B has an inflection point within the domain.\n\nBy Rayleigh’s inflection-point theorem, the absence of an inflection point is a necessary condition for inviscid stability. Therefore, Profile A is predicted to be stable to all infinitesimal disturbances on this basis, while Profile B is not excluded from instability due to the presence of an inflection point.\n\nThus, the correct statement is that Profile A is stable because it has no inflection points within $0rR$, which corresponds to option C. Options A and D incorrectly ascribe inflection-point properties and reasons for stability, B is false because Profile B does have an inflection point, and E is false because not all shear flows are linearly unstable (pipe Poiseuille flow is a canonical counterexample).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1806722"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theoretical stability to practical engineering requires a method to predict the location of laminar-to-turbulent transition.
