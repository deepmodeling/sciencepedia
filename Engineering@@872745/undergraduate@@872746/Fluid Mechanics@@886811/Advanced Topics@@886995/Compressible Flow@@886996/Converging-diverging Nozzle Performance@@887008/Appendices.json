The air in the reservoir can be treated as an ideal gas with a specific heat ratio of $\\gamma = 1.4$. The pressure in the reservoir is the stagnation pressure, $P_0$. The nozzle exhausts into a test chamber where the pressure, known as the back pressure $P_b$, can be controlled.\n\nDuring a system calibration test, the back pressure in the test chamber is deliberately set to be equal to the stagnation pressure of the reservoir, i.e., $P_b = P_0$. Assuming the flow process through the nozzle is isentropic, which of the following statements correctly describes the Mach number distribution throughout the entire length of the nozzle, from the entrance to the exit?\n\nA. The Mach number is zero everywhere in the nozzle.\n\nB. The Mach number is unity (1) everywhere in the nozzle.\n\nC.
