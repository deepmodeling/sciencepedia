The population size at any time $t$ is denoted by $N(t)$. In the absence of external influences, the rate of change of the population, $\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}$, is directly proportional to the current population size. The constant of proportionality, representing the net birth-death rate, is denoted by $k$. To manage the species, a conservation agency implements a program that adds or removes individuals at a controlled, time-varying rate $r(t)$. This stocking rate $r(t)$ acts as the input to the system, while the resulting population $N(t)$ is considered the output.\n\nThe governing differential equation for the system is thus given by the sum of the natural population change and the external stocking rate. For the purpose of system analysis, assume the habitat is initially empty, meaning the initial population $N(0)$ is zero.\n\nDetermine the transfer function $G(s) = \\frac{N(s)}{R(s)}$ of this population model, where $N(s)$ and $R(s)$ are the Laplace transforms of the population $N(t)$ and the stocking rate $r(t)$, respectively.
