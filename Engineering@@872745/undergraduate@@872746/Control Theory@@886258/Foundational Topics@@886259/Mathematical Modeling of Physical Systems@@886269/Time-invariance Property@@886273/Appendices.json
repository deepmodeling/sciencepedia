Consider a continuous-time system designed for high-speed signal analysis, which operates by compressing the input signal in time.

The system's time-invariance cannot be determined without knowing the specific input signal $x(t)$.", "solution": "To determine if the system is time-invariant, we must check if a time shift in the input signal leads to an identical time shift in the output signal. Let the system operator be denoted by $T[\\cdot]$, so that $y(t) = T[x(t)] = x(2t)$. We will follow the formal procedure for testing time-invariance, which involves comparing the results of two distinct pathways.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first pathway: we delay the input signal by an arbitrary constant $t_0$ and then pass it through the system.\nLet the delayed input signal be $x_1(t) = x(t-t_0)$.\nThe output of the system for this delayed input, let's call it $y_1(t)$, is found by applying the system operator $T$ to $x_1(t)$.\n$$y_1(t) = T[x_1(t)]$$\nAccording to the system's definition, the operator replaces the time variable inside the input function with $2t$. Therefore, we substitute $t$ with $2t$ in the expression for $x_1(t)$:\n$$y_1(t) = x_1(2t) = x(2t - t_0)$$\n\nSecond, let's consider the other pathway: we first pass the original input signal $x(t)$ through the system and then delay the resulting output signal by the same amount $t_0$.\nThe output of the system for the original input $x(t)$ is $y(t) = x(2t)$.\nNow, we delay this output signal by $t_0$. Let's call this delayed output $y_2(t)$. This is achieved by replacing every instance of $t$ in the expression for $y(t)$ with $(t-t_0)$.\n$$y_2(t) = y(t-t_0)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $y(t)$:\n$$y_2(t) = x(2(t-t_0)) = x(2t - 2t_0)$$\n\nNow, we compare the results from the two pathways, $y_1(t)$ and $y_2(t)$.\nFrom the first path: $y_1(t) = x(2t - t_0)$.\nFrom the second path: $y_2(t) = x(2t - 2t_0)$.\n\nFor the system to be time-invariant, we must have $y_1(t) = y_2(t)$ for any input signal $x(t)$ and any time shift $t_0$. Comparing the two expressions, we see that:\n$$x(2t - t_0) \\neq x(2t - 2t_0)$$\nfor any general signal $x(t)$ and any non-zero shift $t_0$. Since the shifted output $y(t-t_0)$ is not equal to the output produced by the shifted input $x(t-t_0)$, the system is not time-invariant. It is time-variant.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. This is incorrect. The reasoning is flawed; a constant coefficient does not guarantee time-invariance.\nB. This statement correctly identifies the system as time-variant and provides the correct reason: the output of a delayed input, $x(2t - t_0)$, is not the same as a delayed version of the original output, $x(2t - 2t_0)$.\nC. This is incorrect. A proportional shift is not the same as an identical shift, which violates the definition of time-invariance.\nD. This is incorrect. Firstly, the system $y(t)=x(2t)$ is actually a linear system. Secondly, linearity and time-invariance are independent properties. A system can be linear and time-variant (like this one), or non-linear and time-invariant.\nE. This is incorrect. The properties of linearity and time-invariance are properties of the system itself and are independent of the specific input signal used.
