The exercise demonstrates how state-space representations can model real-world dynamics and introduces the concept of a non-zero direct feedthrough term, represented by the matrix $D$. In this hypothetical measurement setup, the term $\\alpha$ signifies a portion of the input that directly affects the output, a scenario often encountered in signal conditioning and measurement systems [@problem_id:1566499].", "problem": "An engineer is designing a signal conditioning circuit to be used in a measurement system. The core of this circuit consists of a resistor with resistance $R$ and a capacitor with capacitance $C$, connected in series with a variable voltage source that provides an input voltage $u(t)$. A specialized measurement device is configured to produce an output signal, $y(t)$, that is a linear combination of the voltage across the capacitor, $v_C(t)$, and the input voltage, $u(t)$. The output is specifically defined by the relationship $y(t) = v_C(t) + \\alpha u(t)$, where $\\alpha$ is a dimensionless positive constant determined by the internal settings of the measurement device.\n\nAssuming the system starts from a state of rest (i.e., all initial conditions are zero), determine the transfer function $G(s) = \\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)}$, where $Y(s)$ and $U(s)$ are the Laplace transforms of the output signal $y(t)$ and the input signal $u(t)$, respectively.

We can solve this by first finding the differential equation that relates the capacitor voltage $v_C(t)$ to the input voltage $u(t)$, and then using Laplace transforms to find the overall system transfer function.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the circuit to find the governing differential equation.\nAccording to Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) applied to the series RC circuit, the sum of the voltage drops across the resistor ($v_R(t)$) and the capacitor ($v_C(t)$) must equal the source voltage $u(t)$.\n$$u(t) = v_R(t) + v_C(t)$$\nThe voltage across the resistor is given by Ohm's law, $v_R(t) = R i(t)$, where $i(t)$ is the current flowing through the circuit. The same current flows through the capacitor, and it is related to the capacitor voltage by $i(t) = C \\frac{dv_C(t)}{dt}$.\nSubstituting the expression for $i(t)$ into the equation for $v_R(t)$:\n$$v_R(t) = R \\left( C \\frac{dv_C(t)}{dt} \\right) = RC \\frac{dv_C(t)}{dt}$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $v_R(t)$ back into the KVL equation:\n$$u(t) = RC \\frac{dv_C(t)}{dt} + v_C(t)$$\nThis is the first-order linear ordinary differential equation that relates the capacitor voltage $v_C(t)$ to the input voltage $u(t)$.\n\nStep 2: Apply the Laplace transform to the differential equation.\nLet $U(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\}$ and $V_C(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{v_C(t)\\}$ be the Laplace transforms of the input and capacitor voltages, respectively. We apply the Laplace transform to both sides of the differential equation.
