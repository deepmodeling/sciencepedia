This exercise tackles such a scenario, where the open-loop system has a pole in the right-half plane ($P \\gt 0$). Here, the Nyquist criterion reveals a powerful feature: stability can be achieved by ensuring the Nyquist plot encircles the $-1$ point a specific number of times, effectively \"canceling\" the open-loop instability.

The open-loop transfer function is given as $L(s) = \\dfrac{K}{(s-1)(s+3)}$, with $K \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $K0$.\n\nThe Nyquist Stability Criterion is a direct application of Cauchy's Argument Principle. It states that $Z = P + N$, where:\n$P$ is the number of open-loop poles of $L(s)$ in the open right-half-plane (RHP).\n$Z$ is the number of zeros of the characteristic equation, $1+L(s)=0$, in the RHP. These are the closed-loop poles in the RHP.\n$N$ is the number of net counter-clockwise (CCW) encirclements of the critical point $-1+j0$ by the Nyquist plot of $L(s)$. A clockwise (CW) encirclement counts as a negative encirclement.\n\nFirst, we must validate the givens and determine the parameters of the criterion.\nThe open-loop transfer function $L(s)$ has poles at $s=1$ and $s=-3$. The pole at $s=1$ lies in the RHP. Therefore, the number of unstable open-loop poles is $P=1$.\n\nFor the closed-loop system to be stable, it must have no poles in the RHP. This corresponds to the condition $Z=0$.\nSubstituting $Z=0$ and $P=1$ into the Nyquist equation, we find the required number of encirclements for stability:\n$$0 = 1 + N \\implies N = -1$$\nThus, for the closed-loop system to be stable, the Nyquist plot of $L(s)$ must encircle the point $-1+j0$ exactly once in the clockwise direction.\n\nNext, we analyze the Nyquist plot, which is the locus of $L(s)$ evaluated along the standard Nyquist D-contour. For practical purposes, we first examine the mapping of the imaginary axis, $s=j\\omega$, for $\\omega \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$. The frequency response is:\n$$L(j\\omega) = \\frac{K}{(j\\omega-1)(j\\omega+3)}$$\nTo find the points where the plot intersects the real axis, we must find the frequencies $\\omega$ for which the imaginary part of $L(j\\omega)$ is zero. We rationalize the expression:\n$$L(j\\omega) = \\frac{K}{(j\\omega-1)(j\\omega+3)} = \\frac{K}{-\\omega^2 - 3 + j(2\\omega)}$$\n$$L(j\\omega) = \\frac{K}{(-\\omega^2 - 3) + j(2\\omega)} \\cdot \\frac{(-\\omega^2 - 3) - j(2\\omega)}{(-\\omega^2 - 3) - j(2\\omega)} = \\frac{K(-\\omega^2 - 3) - j(2K\\omega)}{(-\\omega^2 - 3)^2 + (2\\omega)^2}$$\nThe real and imaginary parts are:\n$$\\text{Re}[L(j\\omega)] = \\frac{K(-\\omega^2 - 3)}{(\\omega^2+3)^2 + 4\\omega^2}$$\n$$\\text{Im}[L(j\\omega)] = \\frac{-2K\\omega}{(\\omega^2+3)^2 + 4\\omega^2}$$\nFor the plot to be on the real axis, $\\text{Im}[L(j\\omega)]$ must be zero. Given that $K0$, this condition, $\\text{Im}[L(j\\omega)]=0$, is only satisfied when $\\omega=0$. This means the Nyquist plot for $\\omega \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$ crosses the real axis only at the frequency $\\omega=0$.\n\nWe evaluate the function at this crossing frequency:\n$$L(j0) = \\frac{K}{(-1)(3)} = -\\frac{K}{3}$$\nFor $\\omega \\to \\infty$, the magnitude $|L(j\\omega)| \\approx |\\frac{K}{(j\\omega)^2}| = \\frac{K}{\\omega^2} \\to 0$.

The plot for $\\omega \\in (-\\infty, 0)$ lies in the second quadrant.\nThe complete Nyquist plot, including the mapping of the large RHP semicircle which maps to the origin, forms a closed loop that starts at the origin, moves through the second quadrant to the point $-\\frac{K}{3}$ on the real axis, and returns to the origin through the third quadrant. It is a circle with diameter on the real axis between $0$ and $-K/3$.\n\nThe stability of the system depends on the position of the point $-1$ relative to this plot.\nIf the point $-1$ is enclosed by the plot, the encirclement count is $N=-1$ (one clockwise encirclement), which leads to $Z = P + N = 1 + (-1) = 0$. The system is stable. This occurs if the leftmost point of the plot, $-K/3$, is to the left of $-1$.\n$$- \\frac{K}{3}  -1 \\implies K  3$$\nIf the point $-1$ is not enclosed, the encirclement count is $N=0$, which leads to $Z = P + N = 1 + 0 = 1$. The system is unstable. This occurs if the point $-K/3$ is to the right of $-1$.\n$$- \\frac{K}{3}  -1 \\implies 0  K  3$$\nThe critical gain $K^{\\star}$ corresponds to the boundary case where the Nyquist plot passes directly through the point $-1+j0$.
