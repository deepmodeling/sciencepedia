A PLL is a control system that generates an output signal whose phase is related to the phase of an input signal. In this model, the system is configured as a unity negative feedback loop. The open-loop transfer function, which represents the combined behavior of the phase detector, loop filter, and a Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO), is given by:\n$$G(s) = \\frac{K}{s}$$\nHere, $K$ is the total loop gain, a positive constant with units of $s^{-1}$. The system is tasked with tracking a reference signal representing a constant frequency offset. This reference input phase is described by the ramp function $\\theta_{ref}(t) = \\omega_0 t$ for $t \\ge 0$, where $\\omega_0$ is the constant frequency offset in rad/s.\n\nCalculate the steady-state phase error, defined as $e_{ss} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} [\\theta_{ref}(t) - \\theta_{out}(t)]$, where $\\theta_{out}(t)$ is the phase of the output signal.

The steady-state error, $e_{ss}$, can be found using the Final Value Theorem (FVT) if the closed-loop system is stable.\n\nFirst, let's define the error signal in the Laplace domain, $E(s)$. For a unity negative feedback system, the output $Y(s)$ and the error $E(s)$ are related to the input $R(s)$ by the following equations:\n$Y(s) = G(s) E(s)$\n$E(s) = R(s) - Y(s)$\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second gives:\n$E(s) = R(s) - G(s) E(s)$\n$E(s) [1 + G(s)] = R(s)$\n$$E(s) = \\frac{R(s)}{1 + G(s)}$$\n\nThe reference input is a phase ramp given by $\\theta_{ref}(t) = \\omega_0 t$. The Laplace transform of this input, which we denote as $R(s)$, is:\n$$R(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{\\omega_0 t\\} = \\frac{\\omega_0}{s^2}$$\n\nThe open-loop transfer function is given as:\n$$G(s) = \\frac{K}{s}$$\n\nNow we can apply the Final Value Theorem, $e_{ss} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} e(t) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} sE(s)$. Before applying the FVT, we must verify that the closed-loop system is stable. The closed-loop transfer function $T(s)$ is:\n$$T(s) = \\frac{G(s)}{1 + G(s)} = \\frac{\\frac{K}{s}}{1 + \\frac{K}{s}} = \\frac{K}{s+K}$$\nThe characteristic equation is $s+K=0$, which has a single pole at $s = -K$. Since $K$ is given as a positive constant, the pole is in the left-half of the s-plane, which means the closed-loop system is stable. Thus, applying the FVT is valid.\n\nNow we calculate the steady-state error:\n$$e_{ss} = \\lim_{s \\to 0} sE(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} s \\left( \\frac{R(s)}{1 + G(s)} \\right)$$\nSubstitute the expressions for $R(s)$ and $G(s)$:\n$$e_{ss} = \\lim_{s \\to 0} s \\left( \\frac{\\frac{\\omega_0}{s^2}}{1 + \\frac{K}{s}} \\right)$$\nSimplify the expression inside the limit:\n$$e_{ss} = \\lim_{s \\to 0} s \\left( \\frac{\\frac{\\omega_0}{s^2}}{\\frac{s+K}{s}} \\right) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} s \\left( \\frac{\\omega_0}{s^2} \\cdot \\frac{s}{s+K} \\right)$$\n$$e_{ss} = \\lim_{s \\to 0} s \\left( \\frac{\\omega_0}{s(s+K)} \\right) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\frac{\\omega_0}{s+K}$$\nNow, evaluate the limit by substituting $s=0$:\n$$e_{ss} = \\frac{\\omega_0}{0+K} = \\frac{\\omega_0}{K}$$\n\nAlternatively, one could identify the system as Type 1, since the open-loop transfer function $G(s)$ has one pole at the origin (a pure integrator). For a ramp input $r(t) = At$, the steady-state error for a Type 1 system is given by $e_{ss} = A/K_v$, where $K_v$ is the velocity error constant.\nThe velocity error constant is defined as $K_v = \\lim_{s \\to 0} sG(s)$.\n$$K_v = \\lim_{s \\to 0} s \\left( \\frac{K}{s} \\right) = K$$\nIn this problem, the ramp input is $\\theta_{ref}(t) = \\omega_0 t$, so the ramp coefficient is $A = \\omega_0$.\nThe steady-state error is therefore:\n$$e_{ss} = \\frac{A}{K_v} = \\frac{\\omega_0}{K}$$\nBoth methods yield the same result.
