Using Vieta’s relations, $r_{1} + r_{2} = -K  0$ and $r_{1} r_{2} = 4  0$, so both roots are real and negative, which corresponds to overdamped behavior.\n\nEquivalently, comparing $s^{2} + K s + 4 = 0$ to the standard form $s^{2} + 2 \\zeta \\omega_{n} s + \\omega_{n}^{2} = 0$ gives $\\omega_{n}^{2} = 4$ so $\\omega_{n} = 2$ and $\\zeta = \\frac{K}{2 \\omega_{n}} = \\frac{K}{4}$.
