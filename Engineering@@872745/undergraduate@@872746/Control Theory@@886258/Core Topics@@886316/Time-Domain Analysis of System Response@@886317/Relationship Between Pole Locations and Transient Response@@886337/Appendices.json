This modification has the effect of scaling the location of every pole in the s-plane: each new pole's distance from the origin is now $3.25$ times its original distance, while the angle of the line connecting the pole to the origin remains unchanged. Assume the 2% settling time is determined by the pole (or complex conjugate pair of poles) with the least negative real part.\n\nCalculate the new 2% settling time, $T_{s,2}$, for the modified system.
