The unit step function, $u(t)$, is defined as:\n$$ u(t) = \\begin{cases} 1 & t \\ge 0 \\\\ 0 & t < 0 \\end{cases} $$\nThe unit ramp function, $r(t)$, is constructed from the unit step function and is defined as $r(t) = t \\cdot u(t)$.\n\nConsider a time-varying signal, $f(t)$, that represents the normalized thrust profile of a small attitude-control thruster. The signal is zero for all time $t < 0$. At $t=0$, the thruster fires, and its thrust increases linearly with time, reaching a normalized value of 1 at time $t=1$ second.
