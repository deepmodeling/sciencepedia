To minimize interference from environmental noise (such as 60 Hz power-line hum), the student selects a differential amplifier. The manufacturer's datasheet for this amplifier specifies two key performance metrics. The differential-mode voltage gain ($A_d$), which is the intended amplification for the desired signal, is listed as 40 dB. The Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR), a measure of the amplifier's ability to reject unwanted signals common to both inputs, is specified as 60 dB.\n\nTo complete the noise analysis for the circuit, the student must determine the amplifier's common-mode voltage gain ($A_{cm}$). This gain represents the amplification applied to the unwanted common-mode noise.\n\nCalculate the common-mode voltage gain, $A_{cm}$. Express your answer in decibels (dB).", "solution": "The problem requires us to find the common-mode voltage gain ($A_{cm}$) in decibels, given the differential-mode voltage gain ($A_d$) and the Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR), both also in decibels.\n\nFirst, let's recall the definitions. The differential gain $A_d$ and common-mode gain $A_{cm}$ are defined for a differential amplifier with inputs $v_1$ and $v_2$, and output $v_o$. The inputs can be expressed in terms of a differential-mode signal $v_d = v_1 - v_2$ and a common-mode signal $v_{cm} = \\frac{v_1 + v_2}{2}$. The output is then given by $v_o = A_d v_d + A_{cm} v_{cm}$.\n\nThe Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR) is defined as the ratio of the magnitude of the differential gain to the magnitude of the common-mode gain:\n$$\nCMRR = \\frac{|A_d|}{|A_{cm}|}\n$$\nThis relationship is for the absolute gain values (i.e., linear scale, not decibels).\n\nTo work with the given decibel (dB) values, we convert this defining equation into the decibel scale. The formula for converting a voltage gain $A$ to decibels is $A_{dB} = 20 \\log_{10}(|A|)$.\n\nApplying this to the CMRR equation:\n$$\nCMRR_{dB} = 20 \\log_{10}(CMRR) = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{|A_d|}{|A_{cm}|}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms that $\\log(x/y) = \\log(x) - \\log(y)$, we can expand this expression:\n$$\nCMRR_{dB} = 20 \\log_{10}(|A_d|) - 20 \\log_{10}(|A_{cm}|)\n$$\nWe can recognize the terms on the right-hand side as the decibel representations of the differential gain and common-mode gain, respectively.\n$$\nA_{d, dB} = 20 \\log_{10}(|A_d|)\n$$\n$$\nA_{cm, dB} = 20 \\log_{10}(|A_{cm}|)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the equation for $CMRR_{dB}$ gives the fundamental relationship between these quantities in decibels:\n$$\nCMRR_{dB} = A_{d, dB} - A_{cm, dB}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the common-mode gain, $A_{cm, dB}$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for it:\n$$\nA_{cm, dB} = A_{d, dB} - CMRR_{dB}\n$$\nNow, we can substitute the numerical values provided in the problem statement:\n- Differential-mode voltage gain, $A_{d, dB} = 40$ dB\n- Common-Mode Rejection Ratio, $CMRR_{dB} = 60$ dB\n\nPlugging these values into our rearranged formula:\n$$\nA_{cm, dB} = 40 \\text{ dB} - 60 \\text{ dB}\n$$\n$$\nA_{cm, dB} = -20 \\text{ dB}\n$$\nA negative decibel value signifies that the common-mode signal is attenuated rather than amplified. In this case, a gain of -20 dB corresponds to a linear gain factor of $10^{-20/20} = 10^{-1} = 0.1$.
