For a standard second-order bandpass filter, the performance is primarily described by its center frequency, $f_0$, and its quality factor, $Q$. The quality factor is a measure of the filter's selectivity, with a higher $Q$ indicating a narrower passband. The bandwidth, $BW$, of the filter is typically defined as the range of frequencies over which the signal power is attenuated by no more than $3$ dB from its peak at the center frequency.\n\nA filter is designed with a center frequency $f_0 = 10$ kHz and a quality factor $Q = 20$.
