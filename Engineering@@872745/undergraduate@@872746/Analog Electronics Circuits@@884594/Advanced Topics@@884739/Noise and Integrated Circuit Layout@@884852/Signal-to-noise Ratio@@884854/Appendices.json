Let's denote it as $S_V(f) = N_0$, where $N_0$ is a constant. The mean-square noise voltage is the integral of the PSD over the measurement bandwidth.\n\nFor the first measurement, with bandwidth from $f_{L1} = 5.0$ MHz to $f_{H1} = 15.0$ MHz:\n$$V_{n1}^2 = \\int_{f_{L1}}^{f_{H1}} N_0 \\, df = N_0 [f]_{f_{L1}}^{f_{H1}} = N_0 (f_{H1} - f_{L1})$$\n$$V_{n1}^2 = N_0 (15.0 - 5.0) \\text{ MHz} = 10.0 N_0 \\text{ MHz}$$\nSo, the RMS voltage is $V_{n1} = \\sqrt{10.0 N_0 \\text{ MHz}}$.\n\nFor the second measurement, with bandwidth from $f_{L2} = 5.0$ MHz to $f_{H2} = 35.0$ MHz:\n$$V_{n2}^2 = \\int_{f_{L2}}^{f_{H2}} N_0 \\, df = N_0 [f]_{f_{L2}}^{f_{H2}} = N_0 (f_{H2} - f_{L2})$$\n$$V_{n2}^2 = N_0 (35.0 - 5.0) \\text{ MHz} = 30.0 N_0 \\text{ MHz}$$\nSo, the RMS voltage is $V_{n2} = \\sqrt{30.0 N_0 \\text{ MHz}}$.\n\nNow, we compute the ratio $V_{n2}/V_{n1}$:\n$$\\frac{V_{n2}}{V_{n1}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{30.0 N_0 \\text{ MHz}}}{\\sqrt{10.0 N_0 \\text{ MHz}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{30.0}{10.0}} = \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$$\nThis theoretical ratio for white noise perfectly matches the experimental observation.

Since the experimental value matches the pure white noise case almost exactly, it's unlikely that the flicker noise contribution is significant.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe experimental ratio $V_{n2}/V_{n1} = 1.732$ matches the theoretical ratio for a white noise source, which is $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$. The other noise models yield different ratios. Therefore, the dominant noise source has a flat power spectral density, characteristic of white noise.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1333085"}]}
