This practice problem explores the critical phenomenon of aliasing, which occurs when a signal is sampled at a rate less than twice its highest frequency component. Calculating the resulting alias frequency is a crucial skill for ensuring the integrity of any digitized signal and avoiding misleading data [@problem_id:1281274].", "problem": "In a digital audio effects unit, an analog synthesizer generates a pure sinusoidal test tone with a frequency of $f_{in} = 21 \\text{ kHz}$.

Assume the ADC's anti-aliasing filter has been disabled for this test, allowing the $21 \\text{ kHz}$ signal to be sampled directly.

In uniform sampling, continuous-time frequencies separated by integer multiples of the sampling rate are indistinguishable in the discrete-time domain. Specifically, any analog frequency $f$ aliases to frequencies of the form $|f - k f_{s}|$ for integers $k$, and the observed digital frequency is the unique representative in the Nyquist interval $[0, f_{s}/2]$.\n\nTherefore, the alias frequency $f_{a}$ is\n$$\nf_{a} = \\min_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\left| f_{in} - k f_{s} \\right|, \\quad \\text{with } f_{a} \\in [0, f_{s}/2].\n$$\nSince $f_{in} \\in \\left(\\frac{f_{s}}{2}, f_{s}\\right)$, choosing $k=1$ yields\n$$\nf_{a} = \\left| f_{in} - f_{s} \\right| = f_{s} - f_{in},\n$$\nwhich lies in $[0, f_{s}/2]$ because $f_{in}  f_{s}/2$.\n\nSubstituting the given values,\n$$\nf_{a} = 40 - 21 = 19 \\text{ kHz}.\n$$\nThus, the alias frequency present in the sampled data is $19$ kHz.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{19}$$", "id": "1281274"}, {"introduction": "While fundamental ADC architectures are instructive, many high-performance systems use more sophisticated designs like the sub-ranging (or pipelined) converter to achieve both high speed and high resolution.
