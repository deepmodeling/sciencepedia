The performance of a DAC is often described by its linearity errors, quantified in terms of the Ideal Step Size, which is also called the Least Significant Bit (LSB).\n\nTwo key metrics are the Differential Non-Linearity (DNL) and the Integral Non-Linearity (INL). The DNL for a given digital code transition `k -> k+1` measures the deviation of the actual analog step height from the ideal 1 LSB step. The INL at a specific code `m` represents the cumulative effect of these deviations, measuring the difference between the actual output voltage at code `m` and the ideal output voltage.\n\nDuring testing, the engineer performs a series of precise measurements.
