Mastering this process is crucial for predicting how a compensator will influence a system's stability and response.", "problem": "An active lag compensator is implemented using an ideal operational amplifier (op-amp) in an inverting configuration. A resistor with resistance $R_1$ connects the input voltage source $V_{in}$ to the inverting input of the op-amp. The feedback network, which connects the op-amp's output to its inverting input, is composed of a resistor with resistance $R_2$ in parallel with a branch containing a resistor of resistance $R_3$ in series with a capacitor of capacitance $C$. The non-inverting input of the op-amp is connected to ground.\n\nGiven the following component values:\n$R_1 = 10 \\text{ k}\\Omega$\n$R_2 = 90 \\text{ k}\\Omega$\n$R_3 = 10 \\text{ k}\\Omega$\n$C = 1.0 \\text{ }\\mu\\text{F}$\n\nThe system's voltage transfer function, $H(s) = V_{out}(s) / V_{in}(s)$, has one finite zero and one non-zero pole.

Your final answer should be a row matrix containing the value of $p$ first, then the value of $z$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the locations of the pole and zero of the transfer function $H(s) = V_{out}(s) / V_{in}(s)$ for the given active compensator circuit. We assume the operational amplifier (op-amp) is ideal. This implies two key conditions: first, the voltage at the inverting input ($v_-$) is equal to the voltage at the non-inverting input ($v_+$), which is grounded, so $v_- = v_+ = 0$ (virtual ground). Second, no current flows into the op-amp's input terminals.\n\nWe can find the transfer function by applying Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at the inverting input node. The current flowing from the input source through $R_1$ to the inverting node is $I_{in}$. The current flowing from the inverting node through the feedback network to the output is $I_{f}$. According to KCL, the sum of currents entering the node must be zero. Since no current enters the op-amp, we have $I_{in} + I_{f} = 0$.\n\nThe currents are expressed in the Laplace domain as:\n$$I_{in}(s) = \\frac{V_{in}(s) - v_-(s)}{R_1} = \\frac{V_{in}(s)}{R_1}$$\n$$I_f(s) = \\frac{V_{out}(s) - v_-(s)}{Z_f(s)} = \\frac{V_{out}(s)}{Z_f(s)}$$\nwhere $Z_f(s)$ is the impedance of the feedback network.\n\nKCL gives:\n$$\\frac{V_{in}(s)}{R_1} + \\frac{V_{out}(s)}{Z_f(s)} = 0$$\nRearranging for the transfer function $H(s) = V_{out}(s) / V_{in}(s)$:\n$$H(s) = -\\frac{Z_f(s)}{R_1}$$\n\nNext, we must determine the feedback impedance $Z_f(s)$. The feedback network consists of a resistor $R_2$ in parallel with a series combination of resistor $R_3$ and capacitor $C$.\nThe impedance of the series combination of $R_3$ and $C$ is:\n$$Z_{R3C}(s) = R_3 + \\frac{1}{sC}$$\nThe total feedback impedance $Z_f(s)$ is the parallel combination of $R_2$ and $Z_{R3C}(s)$:\n$$Z_f(s) = R_2 \\parallel \\left(R_3 + \\frac{1}{sC}\\right) = \\frac{R_2 \\left(R_3 + \\frac{1}{sC}\\right)}{R_2 + R_3 + \\frac{1}{sC}}$$\nTo simplify this expression, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $sC$:\n$$Z_f(s) = \\frac{R_2 (sR_3C + 1)}{sR_2C + sR_3C + 1} = \\frac{R_2(sR_3C + 1)}{s(R_2+R_3)C + 1}$$\n\nNow, substitute this impedance back into the transfer function expression:\n$$H(s) = -\\frac{1}{R_1} \\left( \\frac{R_2(sR_3C + 1)}{s(R_2+R_3)C + 1} \\right) = -\\frac{R_2}{R_1} \\frac{sR_3C + 1}{s(R_2+R_3)C + 1}$$\n\nTo identify the pole and zero locations, we find the roots of the numerator and the denominator polynomials in $s$.\nThe zero, $z$, is the value of $s$ for which the numerator is zero:\n$$s R_3 C + 1 = 0 \\implies s = -\\frac{1}{R_3 C}$$\nSo, the zero is located at $z = -1/(R_3 C)$.\n\nThe pole, $p$, is the value of $s$ for which the denominator is zero:\n$$s(R_2+R_3)C + 1 = 0 \\implies s = -\\frac{1}{(R_2+R_3)C}$$\nSo, the pole is located at $p = -1/((R_2+R_3)C)$.\n\nNow we can substitute the given numerical values:\n$R_2 = 90 \\text{ k}\\Omega = 90 \\times 10^3 \\Omega$\n$R_3 = 10 \\text{ k}\\Omega = 10 \\times 10^3 \\Omega$\n$C = 1.0 \\text{ }\\mu\\text{F} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ F}$\n\nLet's calculate the location of the zero, $z$:\n$$z = -\\frac{1}{R_3 C} = -\\frac{1}{(10 \\times 10^3 \\text{ }\\Omega)(1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ F})} = -\\frac{1}{10 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ s}} = -\\frac{1}{0.01 \\text{ s}} = -100 \\text{ rad/s}$$\n\nNext, let's calculate the location of the pole, $p$.
