Express your answer in terms of $\\beta$, $V_G$, and $V_{th}$.", "solution": "Let's analyze the circuit to find the composite saturation current. Let $V_x$ be the voltage at the intermediate node, which is the drain of $M_1$ and the source of $M_2$. Since the two transistors are in series, the drain current $I_D$ is the same for both.\n\nFirst, we define the terminal voltages for each transistor in terms of the external voltages $V_G$, $V_D$, and the internal node voltage $V_x$.\nFor transistor $M_1$:\nGate-Source Voltage: $V_{GS1} = V_G - V_{S1} = V_G - 0 = V_G$\nDrain-Source Voltage: $V_{DS1} = V_{D1} - V_{S1} = V_x - 0 = V_x$\n\nFor transistor $M_2$:\nGate-Source Voltage: $V_{GS2} = V_G - V_{S2} = V_G - V_x$\nDrain-Source Voltage: $V_{DS2} = V_{D2} - V_{S2} = V_D - V_x$\n\nThe composite device is in saturation when its current $I_D$ becomes independent of the applied voltage $V_D$, for a given $V_G$. This implies that the operating points of the internal transistors stabilize. Let's examine the conditions for saturation for each transistor. An n-channel MOSFET enters saturation when $V_{DS} \\ge V_{GS} - V_{th}$.\n\nSaturation condition for $M_1$:\n$V_{DS1} \\ge V_{GS1} - V_{th} \\implies V_x \\ge V_G - V_{th}$\n\nSaturation condition for $M_2$:\n$V_{DS2} \\ge V_{GS2} - V_{th} \\implies V_D - V_x \\ge (V_G - V_x) - V_{th} \\implies V_D \\ge V_G - V_{th}$\n\nThe saturation condition for $M_2$ depends only on the external voltages $V_D$ and $V_G$. This suggests that as we increase $V_D$ from zero, $M_2$ will be the transistor that defines the onset of saturation for the composite device. When $V_D \\ge V_G - V_{th}$, $M_2$ is in saturation. In this regime, the current $I_D$ is determined by the interplay between the two transistors. Let's hypothesize that when the composite device is saturated, $M_2$ is in saturation and $M_1$ is in the triode region. We will verify this assumption later.\n\nAssuming $M_2$ is in saturation and $M_1$ is in the triode region, we can write their respective current equations:\nCurrent through $M_2$ (saturation):\n$$I_{D2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta (V_{GS2} - V_{th})^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta (V_G - V_x - V_{th})^2$$\n\nCurrent through $M_1$ (triode):\n$$I_{D1} = \\beta \\left[ (V_{GS1} - V_{th})V_{DS1} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{DS1}^2 \\right] = \\beta \\left[ (V_G - V_{th})V_x - \\frac{1}{2}V_x^2 \\right]$$\n\nSince the currents must be equal ($I_{D1} = I_{D2} = I_{D,sat}$), we can equate these two expressions to solve for the intermediate voltage $V_x$:\n$$\\beta \\left[ (V_G - V_{th})V_x - \\frac{1}{2}V_x^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta (V_G - V_x - V_{th})^2$$\n\nThe parameter $\\beta$ cancels out. Let's expand and rearrange the equation:\n$$2(V_G - V_{th})V_x - V_x^2 = (V_G - V_{th})^2 - 2(V_G - V_{th})V_x + V_x^2$$\n$$2V_x^2 - 4(V_G - V_{th})V_x + (V_G - V_{th})^2 = 0$$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation for $V_x$. We can solve it using the quadratic formula $V_x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a=2$, $b=-4(V_G - V_{th})$, and $c=(V_G - V_{th})^2$.\n$$V_x = \\frac{4(V_G - V_{th}) \\pm \\sqrt{[-4(V_G - V_{th})]^2 - 4(2)(V_G - V_{th})^2}}{2(2)}$$\n$$V_x = \\frac{4(V_G - V_{th}) \\pm \\sqrt{16(V_G - V_{th})^2 - 8(V_G - V_{th})^2}}{4}$$\n$$V_x = \\frac{4(V_G - V_{th}) \\pm \\sqrt{8(V_G - V_{th})^2}}{4}$$\n$$V_x = \\frac{4(V_G - V_{th}) \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}(V_G - V_{th})}{4}$$\n$$V_x = (V_G - V_{th}) \\left( \\frac{4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\right) = (V_G - V_{th}) \\left( 1 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right)$$\n\nThis gives two possible solutions for $V_x$:\n1. $V_x = (V_G - V_{th})(1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})$\n2. $V_x = (V_G - V_{th})(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})$\n\nNow we must check these solutions against our initial assumption that $M_1$ is in the triode region. The condition for $M_1$ to be in triode is $V_{DS1}  V_{GS1} - V_{th}$, which translates to $V_x  V_G - V_{th}$.\nThe first solution, $V_x = (V_G - V_{th})(1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})$, is clearly greater than $(V_G - V_{th})$, which violates the triode condition for $M_1$. Thus, this solution is not physically valid.\nThe second solution, $V_x = (V_G - V_{th})(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})$, is less than $(V_G - V_{th})$ because $(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})$ is positive and less than 1. This is consistent with $M_1$ being in the triode region. Therefore, this is the correct intermediate voltage.\n\nNow that we have the correct expression for $V_x$, we can substitute it into either current equation to find the composite saturation current $I_{D,sat}$. Using the saturation equation for $M_2$ is more straightforward:\n$$I_{D,sat} = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta (V_G - V_x - V_{th})^2$$\nLet's first evaluate the term $(V_G - V_x - V_{th})$:\n$$V_G - V_x - V_{th} = (V_G - V_{th}) - V_x$$\n$$= (V_G - V_{th}) - (V_G - V_{th})\\left(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)$$\n$$= (V_G - V_{th}) \\left[ 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) \\right]$$\n$$= (V_G - V_{th}) \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right)$$\n\nNow, substitute this back into the current equation:\n$$I_{D,sat} = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta \\left[ (V_G - V_{th}) \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right]^2$$\n$$I_{D,sat} = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta (V_G - V_{th})^2 \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right)^2$$\n$$I_{D,sat} = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta (V_G - V_{th})^2 \\left( \\frac{2}{4} \\right)$$\n$$I_{D,sat} = \\frac{1}{4}\\beta (V_G - V_{th})^2$$\n\nThis is the expression for the saturation current of the composite device. It is independent of $V_D$, as required for saturation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}\\beta (V_{G} - V_{th})^{2}}$$", "id": "1318282"}]}
