The input signal is fed through a series capacitor $C$. The output of the circuit, $v_{out}(t)$, is taken across a parallel network connected to the other side of the capacitor. This parallel network consists of two branches connected between the output node and ground. The first branch contains a resistor $R$. The second branch consists of an ideal diode $D$ in series with a constant DC voltage source of voltage $V_B$.\n\nThe circuit is configured as follows: The anode of the ideal diode $D$ is connected to the output node, and its cathode is connected to the positive terminal of the DC voltage source $V_B$. The negative terminal of $V_B$ is connected to ground.\n\nThe input signal $v_{in}(t)$ is a periodic triangular wave with a period of $T = 4.0$ ms. The voltage varies linearly between a maximum value of $V_{max} = +10.0$ V and a minimum value of $V_{min} = -10.0$ V. At time $t=0$, the signal is at its maximum value, $v_{in}(0) = +10.0$ V.
