The student's verbal description of the model is as follows:\n\n1.  There are three external terminals: Base (B), Collector (C), and Emitter (E).\n2.  An internal node, let's call it E', is created.\n3.  The Base terminal (B) is connected directly to the internal node E'.\n4.  A small-signal dynamic emitter resistance, $r_e$, connects the internal node E' to the Emitter terminal (E). The current flowing through this resistor is the small-signal emitter current, $i_e$.\n5.  A dependent current source connects the Collector terminal (C) to the internal node E'. The magnitude of this source is given by $\\alpha i_e$, where $\\alpha$ is the common-base current gain.

It should be placed between the Base terminal (B) and the internal node E'.\n\nE. The magnitude of the dependent current source is incorrect. It should be equal to $i_e$, not $\\alpha i_e$.", "solution": "The goal is to identify the fundamental error in the described small-signal T-model for an NPN BJT. Let's analyze the description step-by-step based on the standard, correct T-model and BJT current conventions.\n\nFirst, we establish the standard current conventions for an NPN BJT in the forward-active region. The collector current ($i_c$) and base current ($i_b$) are defined as flowing into the device, while the emitter current ($i_e$) flows out. Kirchhoff's Current Law for the transistor as a whole gives the relationship $i_e = i_b + i_c$. The small-signal currents follow these same directional conventions.\n\nThe collector current is related to the emitter current by the common-base current gain, $\\alpha$:\n$$i_c = \\alpha i_e$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a positive constant slightly less than 1.\n\nNow, let's examine the structure of the small-signal T-model.\n1.  **Base and Emitter Path**: The model correctly places a dynamic resistance $r_e$ between an internal node (E') and the external emitter terminal (E). The voltage drop across this resistor is $v_{be}$, the base-emitter voltage. The current flowing through it is the emitter current, $i_e$. It also correctly connects the external base terminal (B) to this internal node E'. This part of the model establishes the relationship $v_{be} = i_e r_e$. This description is accurate.\n\n2.  **Collector Path**: The model must represent the collector current, $i_c$. The T-model uses a dependent current source to do this. The magnitude of this source is correctly identified as $\\alpha i_e$.\n\n3.  **Direction of the Dependent Current Source**: This is the crucial point. The source models the collector current $i_c$. By convention, $i_c$ is defined as the current flowing *into* the collector terminal. Therefore, the dependent current source in the model must show a current flowing *from the rest of the circuit towards the collector terminal*. In the T-model, \"the rest of the circuit\" is the internal node E'. Thus, the arrow of the current source must point from node E' towards the collector terminal C.\n\nThe student's description states that the source is directed \"from the Collector terminal (C) towards the internal node E'\". This describes a current flowing *out of* the collector terminal, which would represent $-i_c$, not $i_c$. This is a direct contradiction of the physical behavior and standard definition of collector current in an NPN transistor.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n**A. The dependent current source $\\alpha i_e$ is directed incorrectly. It should be directed from the internal node E' towards the Collector terminal (C).**\nThis statement is correct. As derived above, to model the collector current $i_c$ flowing *into* the collector terminal, the source must draw current from the internal node E' *to* the collector terminal C. The student described the opposite direction.\n\n**B. The magnitude of the dependent current source is incorrect. It should be dependent on the base current $i_b$, not the emitter current $i_e$.**\nThis is incorrect. While the collector current can also be expressed as $i_c = \\beta i_b$, the T-model is structured specifically to use the relationship $i_c = \\alpha i_e$. The hybrid-$\\pi$ model uses a source dependent on $v_{be}$ (which is $g_m v_{be}$), which can be related to $i_b$ or $i_e$. The T-model's primary controlling variable is $i_e$.\n\n**C. The connection of the Base terminal (B) is incorrect. It should be connected to the Emitter terminal (E), not the internal node E'.**\nThis is incorrect. Connecting the base directly to the emitter would short-circuit the base-emitter junction in the model, making $v_{be}=0$, which is wrong. The essence of the T-model is the \"T\" junction at node E'.\n\n**D. The location of the resistance $r_e$ is incorrect. It should be placed between the Base terminal (B) and the internal node E'.**\nThis is incorrect. Placing a resistor between B and E' would be describing the base resistance $r_b$, but the primary component of the T-model's input impedance is $r_e$, located in the emitter leg. The component is correctly identified as $r_e$ and placed in the emitter path in the description.\n\n**E. The magnitude of the dependent current source is incorrect. It should be equal to $i_e$, not $\\alpha i_e$.**\nThis is incorrect. Setting the source to $i_e$ implies $i_c = i_e$. This would violate KCL ($i_e = i_b + i_c$), as it requires the base current $i_b$ to be zero, meaning the transistor has no gain. The factor $\\alpha$ is fundamental.\n\nTherefore, the primary conceptual flaw is the direction of the dependent current source.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1337247"}, {"introduction": "With a solid understanding of the T-model's parameters and structure, we can now put it to work.

The solution is straightforward using the T-model's core principles.\n\n1.  First, we identify the relationship between the collector current $i_c$ and the emitter current $i_e$. The T-model's central principle is that the collector current is a dependent source controlled by the emitter current: $i_c = \\alpha i_e$.\n\n2.  We need to find the value of $\\alpha$ from the given common-emitter current gain, $\\beta = 120$. The relationship is:\n    $$\\alpha = \\frac{\\beta}{\\beta+1} = \\frac{120}{120+1} = \\frac{120}{121}$$\n\n3.  The problem states that a small-signal sinusoidal current source, $i_s(t)$, is injected into the emitter. Therefore, the small-signal emitter current $i_e(t)$ is equal to $i_s(t)$. The amplitude of the emitter current is $I_{e,peak} = I_{peak} = 20.0 \\text{ µA}$.\n\n4.  The amplitude of the resulting collector current, $I_{c,peak}$, can now be calculated:\n    $$I_{c,peak} = \\alpha \\cdot I_{e,peak} = \\frac{120}{121} \\times 20.0 \\text{ µA}$$\n\n5.  The small-signal output voltage at the collector, $v_c$, is determined by the collector current flowing through the load resistor $R_C$. Since the DC supply is an AC ground, the collector current flows from the collector node through $R_C$ to AC ground, creating a voltage drop. The relationship is $v_c(t) = -i_c(t) R_C$. The amplitude of this voltage is:\n    $$|v_c|_{peak} = I_{c,peak} \\times R_C = \\left( \\frac{120}{121} \\times 20.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ A} \\right) \\times (4.70 \\times 10^3 \\, \\Omega)$$\n\n6.
