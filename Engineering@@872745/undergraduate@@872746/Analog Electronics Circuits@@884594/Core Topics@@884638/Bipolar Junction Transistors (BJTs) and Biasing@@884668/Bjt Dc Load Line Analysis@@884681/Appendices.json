This first practice focuses on establishing the DC load line, which graphically represents all possible DC operating points for the transistor. By determining the two endpoints of this line—cutoff and saturation—you define the complete operational range of the circuit, a foundational step for any further analysis.", "problem": "An electronics engineer is designing a driver circuit for a low-power actuator. The core of the circuit is a common-emitter configuration using an NPN Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT), which will be operated as a simple switch. To ensure reliable switching and to protect the BJT, the engineer must define the DC load line. The two key operating points on this load line are cutoff and saturation.\n\nIn the cutoff state, the transistor behaves like an open switch. The design requires the collector-emitter voltage at cutoff, $V_{CE(off)}$, to be exactly $15.0$ V.\n\nIn the saturation state, the transistor behaves like a closed switch. The collector current reaches its maximum possible value, the saturation current $I_{C(sat)}$. For this specific application, the required saturation current is $I_{C(sat)} = 5.00$ mA. In an ideal analysis of the saturation condition, the collector-emitter voltage is considered to be zero.\n\nBased on these ideal design specifications, determine the required DC supply voltage, $V_{CC}$, and the total equivalent resistance, $R_L$, in the collector-emitter loop. Express your answer as a pair of numerical values ($V_{CC}$, $R_L$), with $V_{CC}$ in volts and $R_L$ in kilohms. Both values must be calculated to three significant figures.", "solution": "For a common-emitter BJT switch, the collector-emitter loop satisfies Kirchhoff’s voltage law:\n$$V_{CC}=I_{C}R_{L}+V_{CE}.$$\n\nThe DC load line endpoints follow from this linear relation:\n- Cutoff: $I_{C}=0$, hence $V_{CE(\\text{off})}=V_{CC}$. Given $V_{CE(\\text{off})}=15.0$, it follows that\n$$V_{CC}=15.0.$$\n\n- Saturation (ideal): $V_{CE}=0$, hence $I_{C(\\text{sat})}=\\frac{V_{CC}}{R_{L}}$. Given $I_{C(\\text{sat})}=5.00 \\times 10^{-3}$, solve for $R_{L}$:\n$$R_{L}=\\frac{V_{CC}}{I_{C(\\text{sat})}}=\\frac{15.0}{5.00 \\times 10^{-3}}=3.00 \\times 10^{3}.$$\n\nExpressing $R_{L}$ in kilohms gives $R_{L}=3.00$ in kilohms.
