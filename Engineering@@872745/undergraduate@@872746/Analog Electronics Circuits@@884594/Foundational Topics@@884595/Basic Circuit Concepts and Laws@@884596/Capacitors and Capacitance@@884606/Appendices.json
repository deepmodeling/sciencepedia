This practice shifts the focus from analysis to synthesis, challenging you to construct a network with a precise, non-standard capacitance using only a supply of identical standard capacitors.

A critical stage of the filter requires a capacitor with a very specific, non-standard capacitance value of $C_{target}$. The student only has access to a large supply of identical, high-precision standard capacitors, each with a capacitance of $C_0$. The required capacitance is related to the standard one by the exact relation $C_{target} = \\frac{3}{5}C_0$.\n\nAssuming that the student can only use series and parallel connections to combine the standard capacitors, what is the absolute minimum number of individual $C_0$ capacitors required to construct a network that has an equivalent capacitance of exactly $C_{target}$?", "solution": "The goal is to find the minimum number of capacitors, each with capacitance $C_0$, required to form a network with an equivalent capacitance of $C_{eq} = \\frac{3}{5}C_0$. We will use the rules for combining capacitors in series and parallel.\nFor capacitors $C_1, C_2, \\dots, C_n$:\n- In parallel, the equivalent capacitance is $C_p = C_1 + C_2 + \\dots + C_n$.\n- In series, the equivalent capacitance is $C_s = (C_1^{-1} + C_2^{-1} + \\dots + C_n^{-1})^{-1}$.\n\nThe target capacitance is $C_{eq} = \\frac{3}{5}C_0$, which is less than $C_0$. A parallel combination of capacitors always results in an equivalent capacitance that is greater than or equal to the largest individual capacitance in the combination. Therefore, to obtain a capacitance less than $C_0$, the final connection in our network must be a series combination.\n\nLet's model the network as two sub-networks, with capacitances $C_A$ and $C_B$, connected in series. The equivalent capacitance is given by:\n$$C_{eq} = \\left( C_A^{-1} + C_B^{-1} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{3}{5}C_0$$\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides gives:\n$$C_A^{-1} + C_B^{-1} = \\frac{5}{3}C_0^{-1}$$\nTo find the minimum number of capacitors, we should use a strategy of building the network with the smallest possible components at each stage. The simplest possible network is a single capacitor, $C_0$. Let's try setting one of the sub-networks, say $C_A$, to be a single capacitor. So, $C_A = C_0$.\nSubstituting this into our equation:\n$$C_0^{-1} + C_B^{-1} = \\frac{5}{3}C_0^{-1}$$\nNow, we solve for the required capacitance of the other sub-network, $C_B$:\n$$C_B^{-1} = \\frac{5}{3}C_0^{-1} - C_0^{-1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{3} - 1\\right)C_0^{-1} = \\frac{2}{3}C_0^{-1}$$\nTaking the reciprocal to find $C_B$:\n$$C_B = \\frac{3}{2}C_0$$\nWe now have a sub-problem: find the minimum number of $C_0$ capacitors to create a network with capacitance $C_B = \\frac{3}{2}C_0$. Let this number be $N_B$. The total number of capacitors will then be $1 + N_B$ (for the single capacitor $C_A$ and the network $C_B$).\n\nThe new target capacitance is $C_B = \\frac{3}{2}C_0$, which is greater than $C_0$. To obtain a capacitance greater than $C_0$, the final connection in this sub-network must be a parallel combination. Let's model $C_B$ as two sub-networks, $C_C$ and $C_D$, in parallel:\n$$C_B = C_C + C_D = \\frac{3}{2}C_0$$\nAgain, let's use the simplest possible component for one of the sub-networks. We set $C_C = C_0$.\nSubstituting this into the equation for $C_B$:\n$$C_0 + C_D = \\frac{3}{2}C_0$$\nSolving for the required capacitance of sub-network $C_D$:\n$$C_D = \\frac{3}{2}C_0 - C_0 = \\frac{1}{2}C_0$$\nThis gives us a final sub-problem: find the minimum number of capacitors, $N_D$, to create a network with capacitance $C_D = \\frac{1}{2}C_0$. The number of capacitors for the $C_B$ network will then be $N_B = 1 + N_D$.\n\nTo obtain a capacitance of $C_D = \\frac{1}{2}C_0$, which is less than $C_0$, we must use a series combination. The most straightforward way to achieve this is to connect two capacitors of capacitance $C_0$ in series:\n$$C_D = (C_0^{-1} + C_0^{-1})^{-1} = (2C_0^{-1})^{-1} = \\frac{1}{2}C_0$$\nThis configuration requires two capacitors. So, $N_D = 2$.\n\nNow we can work our way back up to find the total number of capacitors.\n- The number of capacitors to build sub-network $C_B$ is $N_B = 1 (\\text{for } C_C) + N_D = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n- The total number of capacitors for the entire network is $N_{total} = 1 (\\text{for } C_A) + N_B = 1 + 3 = 4$.\n\nThis systematic decomposition, often related to continued fractions for such ratio problems, ensures that we have found the minimum number of capacitors. The final network consists of a single capacitor $C_0$ in series with a block, where that block is composed of another single capacitor $C_0$ in parallel with a pair of capacitors in series.
