Consider a simplified model for such a process. A primary storage capacitor with capacitance $C_1$ is initially charged to a voltage $V_0$.

This energy loss is equal to the difference between the total energy stored in the capacitors initially and the total energy stored in the capacitors in the final equilibrium state. The principle of conservation of energy dictates that any change in the stored electrostatic potential energy of the system must be accounted for by the energy dissipated as heat in the resistor.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the initial state of the system at $t=0$.\nThe capacitor $C_1$ is charged to a voltage $V_0$, and the capacitor $C_2$ is uncharged. The initial energy stored in the system, $U_{initial}$, is the sum of the energies stored in each capacitor.\nThe energy stored in a capacitor $C$ with voltage $V$ across it is given by $U = \\frac{1}{2}CV^2$.\nSo, for our system:\nEnergy in $C_1$ at $t=0$ is $U_1 = \\frac{1}{2}C_1 V_0^2$.\nEnergy in $C_2$ at $t=0$ is $U_2 = \\frac{1}{2}C_2 (0)^2 = 0$.\nThe total initial stored energy is:\n$$U_{initial} = U_1 + U_2 = \\frac{1}{2}C_1 V_0^2$$\n\nNext, let's analyze the final state of the system as $t \\to \\infty$.\nAfter the switch is closed, charge flows from $C_1$ to $C_2$ through the resistor $R$. This process continues until the voltage across both capacitors is equal, at which point the current ceases and the system reaches electrostatic equilibrium. Let this final equilibrium voltage be $V_{final}$.\nSince the two capacitors are connected in parallel, the voltage across them must be the same: $V_{final}$.\nThe total charge in the circuit is conserved because the capacitors and resistor form an isolated loop. The initial total charge, $Q_{initial}$, is the charge on $C_1$, since $C_2$ is initially uncharged.
