We'll examine a common scenario where a circuit, seemingly simplified for efficiency by removing a logically redundant term, inadvertently becomes prone to glitches. This practice demonstrates how the removal of a consensus term creates a timing problem, highlighting the crucial difference between logical equivalence and a robust, hazard-free design. [@problem_id:1941645]", "problem": "A digital logic circuit is designed to implement the Boolean function $F(A, B, C) = AB + A'C + BC$. This circuit is initially free from static hazards. A novice designer, attempting to simplify the circuit, removes the product term $BC$, believing it to be redundant. The resulting optimized function is $F_{opt}(A, B, C) = AB + A'C$. This optimization inadvertently introduces a static-1 hazard into the circuit, meaning for a specific input change, the output, which should remain logically HIGH (1), will momentarily glitch to LOW (0).\n\nIdentify the single-variable input transition that will cause this static-1 hazard in the optimized circuit.\n\nA.

Variable $A$ changes state while $B=0$ and $C=0$.\n\nE. Variable $B$ changes state while $A=1$ and $C=0$.", "solution": "We begin with the original function $F(A,B,C) = AB + A'C + BC$, which contains the consensus term $BC$ for the pair of implicants $AB$ and $A'C$. By the consensus theorem, for variables $X,Y,Z$ one has $XY + X'Z = XY + X'Z + YZ$, where $YZ$ is the consensus term. Mapping $X \\mapsto A$, $Y \\mapsto B$, and $Z \\mapsto C$, the consensus term of $AB$ and $A'C$ is $BC$.\n\nThe novice designer removes $BC$ and obtains $F_{opt}(A,B,C) = AB + A'C$. This creates the classic static-1 hazard condition: a single-variable input change that moves between two adjacent minterms covered by different implicants ($AB$ and $A'C$) while the consensus term ($BC$) that would hold the output HIGH is missing.\n\nTo expose the hazardous transition explicitly, consider changing $A$ while holding $B=1$ and $C=1$. Evaluate $F_{opt}$ on the two end states:\n- At $(A,B,C) = (1,1,1)$: $AB = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$, $A'C = 0 \\cdot 1 = 0$, hence $F_{opt} = 1$.\n- At $(A,B,C) = (0,1,1)$: $AB = 0 \\cdot 1 = 0$, $A'C = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$, hence $F_{opt} = 1$.\n\nThus, logically the output should remain $1$ across the single-variable transition $A:1 \\to 0$ with $B=1$, $C=1$. However, due to unequal propagation delays, when $A$ changes, the product $AB$ may drop to $0$ before $A'$ rises so that $A'C$ becomes $1$, producing a moment when both $AB=0$ and $A'C=0$ and causing a static-1 glitch. The removed consensus term $BC$ would have provided $BC=1$ for $B=1$, $C=1$, preventing this glitch.\n\nCheck the options:\n- A: $B$ changes with $A=0$, $C=1$. Here $A'C=1$ and $AB=0$ regardless of $B$, so the output is held by a single product term; no static-1 hazard.\n- B: $C$ changes with $A=1$, $B=1$. Here $AB=1$ independent of $C$, so no static-1 hazard.\n- C: $A$ changes with $B=1$, $C=1$. As shown, this is the hazardous transition.\n- D: $A$ changes with $B=0$, $C=0$. The output stays $0$, so not a static-1 hazard.\n- E: $B$ changes with $A=1$, $C=0$. The output changes logically, so not a static-1 hazard.\n\nTherefore, the single-variable input transition that causes the static-1 hazard is when $A$ changes while $B=1$ and $C=1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1941645"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how a hazard can be created, our next step is to learn how to eliminate one. This problem focuses on static-0 hazards in Product-of-Sums (POS) circuits, which is the dual case to the static-1 hazard in a Sum-of-Products (SOP) form. By applying the dual of the consensus theorem, you will see how to strategically add a redundant term to ensure the output remains stable during a critical input transition. [@problem_id:1941606]", "problem": "In the design of a safety-critical monitoring system, a digital logic circuit is implemented to process signals from three sensors, represented by Boolean variables $A$, $B$, and $C$. The output of the circuit, $F$, is described by the following Product-of-Sums (POS) expression:\n\n$$F(A, B, C) = (A + B')(A' + C)$$\n\nA detailed timing analysis has revealed that a static-0 hazard can occur in this circuit. A static-0 hazard is a transient, unwanted logic 1 pulse on an output that is supposed to remain at a steady logic 0 during an input change. This particular hazard manifests when inputs $B$ and $C$ are held at specific constant values while input $A$ transitions from one logic level to the other. To ensure system reliability, this hazard must be eliminated by adding a single redundant sum term (a maxterm) to the expression for $F$.\n\nWhich of the following sum terms, when ANDed with the original POS expression, will eliminate the static-0 hazard?\n\nA. $(B + C)$\n\nB. $(B' + C)$\n\nC. $(A + B)$\n\nD. $(A' + B')$\n\nE. $(A + C)$", "solution": "Let the given function be written as a product of sums:\n$$F(A,B,C)=(A+B')(A'+C).$$\nDefine the two sum terms as $S_{1}=A+B'$ and $S_{2}=A'+C$. A static-0 hazard in a POS implementation arises when for fixed values of some inputs the output is $0$ both before and after a change in one input, but due to unequal path delays there can be a brief interval when all sum terms evaluate to $1$, causing a spurious $1$ at the output.\n\nWe seek fixed $B$ and $C$ such that $F=0$ for both $A=0$ and $A=1$. In a POS, $F=0$ if at least one sum term equals $0$. For $S_{1}=0$ we require $A=0$ and $B'=0$, i.e., $A=0$ and $B=1$. For $S_{2}=0$ we require $A'=0$ and $C=0$, i.e., $A=1$ and $C=0$. Thus the same fixed inputs $B=1$ and $C=0$ make $F=0$ for both $A=0$ and $A=1$:\n- If $B=1$ and $C=0$ with $A=0$, then $S_{1}=(0+1')=0$ and $S_{2}=(0'+0)=1$, so $F=0$.\n- If $B=1$ and $C=0$ with $A=1$, then $S_{1}=(1+1')=1$ and $S_{2}=(1'+0)=0$, so $F=0$.\n\nTherefore, a static-0 hazard can occur when $B=1$, $C=0$, and $A$ toggles, because during the transition unequal delays can make $S_{1}=1$ and $S_{2}=1$ momentarily, producing an unwanted $F=1$ pulse.\n\nTo eliminate a static-0 hazard in a POS, add a redundant sum term that is $0$ throughout the hazardous input condition, independent of the switching variable, so that the product always has at least one $0$ factor. We need a sum term $S_{3}$ such that $S_{3}=0$ when $B=1$ and $C=0$, regardless of $A$. The term\n$$S_{3}=B'+C$$\nsatisfies this, since for $B=1$ and $C=0$ we have $S_{3}=(1'+0)=0$, independent of $A$.\n\nAdding this term does not change the steady-state function, by the dual of the consensus theorem. For Boolean variables $X,Y,Z$,\n$$(X+Y)(X'+Z)=(X+Y)(X'+Z)(Y+Z).$$\nWith $X=A$, $Y=B'$, and $Z=C$, we obtain\n$$(A+B')(A'+C)=(A+B')(A'+C)(B'+C).$$\nA direct logical justification: whenever $(A+B')=1$ and $(A'+C)=1$, then $(B'+C)=1$; indeed, if $(B'+C)=0$ then $B=1$ and $C=0$, which would force $(A+B')=A$ and $(A'+C)=A'$, making it impossible for both sums to be $1$ simultaneously. Hence multiplying by $(B'+C)$ leaves $F$ unchanged but removes the static-0 hazard by ensuring a persistent zero factor during the hazardous transition.\n\nAmong the options, the required redundant sum term is $(B'+C)$, which is option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1941606"}, {"introduction": "Hazards are not just theoretical possibilities; they are physical events with measurable duration.
