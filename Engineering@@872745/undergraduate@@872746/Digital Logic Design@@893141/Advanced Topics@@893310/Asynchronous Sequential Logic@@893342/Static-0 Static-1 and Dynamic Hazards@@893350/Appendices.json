Due to unequal propagation delays, the output of one product term may drop before the other rises during the single-variable transition, causing the OR output to momentarily drop to $0$. The consensus theorem identifies a consensus term that would cover such hazards; for $F=\\bar{A}B+AC$, the consensus term is $BC$, since\n$$\n\\text{consensus}(\\bar{A}B,AC)=BC.\n$$\nIts absence indicates a potential static-1 hazard when $A$ toggles with $B=C=1$.\n\nWe now evaluate each option:\n\n- Option A: $(A,B,C)$ transitions from $(0,1,0)$ to $(0,1,1)$. Both minterms $010$ and $011$ are $1$ and are covered by the single product $\\bar{A}B$ (which does not depend on $C$). Hence, during this transition the AND gate for $\\bar{A}B$ remains asserted, so no static-1 hazard occurs.\n\n- Option B: $(A,B,C)$ transitions from $(1,0,1)$ to $(1,1,1)$. Both minterms $101$ and $111$ are $1$ and are covered by the single product $AC$ (which does not depend on $B$). Hence, no static-1 hazard occurs.\n\n- Option C: $(A,B,C)$ transitions from $(0,1,1)$ to $(1,1,1)$. Both minterms $011$ and $111$ are $1$, but $011$ is covered by $\\bar{A}B$ while $111$ is covered by $AC$. These are different product terms, and the consensus term $BC$ is not present in the minimal SOP. With $B=C=1$ held constant while $A$ switches, the output is ideally $F=\\bar{A}+A=1$, but in the two-gate implementation the $\\bar{A}B$ term can fall before the $AC$ term rises (or vice versa), creating a static-1 hazard. Therefore this transition can cause a static-1 hazard.\n\n- Option D: $(A,B,C)$ transitions from $(0,0,0)$ to $(1,0,0)$. Both minterms $000$ and $100$ yield $F=0$, so this is not a static-1 condition and is irrelevant for static-1 hazards.\n\n- Option E: $(A,B,C)$ transitions from $(1,1,0)$ to $(1,1,1)$. The initial state $110$ yields $F=0$ and the final state $111$ yields $F=1$, so the output does not remain at $1$ and this is not a static-1 scenario.\n\nTherefore, the only transition that can cause a static-1 hazard in the minimal SOP realization is Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1964038"}, {"introduction": "Identifying a hazard is only half the battle; the next critical step is to eliminate it.

When $B$ transitions from $1$ to $0$, there is an interval immediately after the change where $B=0$ has already propagated to the $B C$ term (making $B C=0$), but $B'$ has not yet risen (so $B'=0$), making $A B'=0$. Consequently, during this interval $Y=0$, which is a static-$1$ hazard.\n\nStep 3: Determine the redundant (consensus) term that eliminates the hazard.\nUsing the consensus theorem, for terms of the form $x y + y' z$, the consensus term is $x z$, and adding it does not change the steady-state logic function:\n$$\nx y + y' z + x z = x y + y' z.\n$$\nMap $x=C$, $y=B$, and $z=A$.
