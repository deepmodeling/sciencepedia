This first exercise demonstrates a classic scenario where a minimal Sum-of-Products (SOP) implementation creates a static-1 hazard.

The output of this circuit, denoted by the function $F$, must remain at a steady logic 1 to keep the interlock engaged during critical operational phases. The circuit's behavior is determined by three binary sensor inputs, $A$, $B$, and $C$.\n\nAn engineer has implemented the circuit based on the following minimal Sum-of-Products (SOP) expression:\n$$F(A,B,C) = A'B' + BC$$\nDuring testing, a critical flaw was discovered. For a specific transition where only one input variable changes its state, the output $F$ momentarily drops to logic 0 before returning to logic 1. This \"glitch,\" known as a static-1 hazard, could erroneously disengage the safety interlock, posing a significant risk.\n\nTo rectify this design flaw, your task is to make the circuit robust against this static-1 hazard by adding a single redundant product term to the SOP expression. This modification is equivalent to adding one AND gate to the circuit and feeding its output into the final OR gate. What is the Boolean expression for this required redundant product term?", "solution": "We are given the minimal SOP realization\n$$F(A,B,C)=A'B' + BC.$$\nA static-1 hazard in an SOP implementation arises when two product terms that differ only in the complementation of a single variable cover adjacent 1-cells but are implemented by separate paths; during a transition of that single variable, one path may turn off before the other turns on, momentarily producing 0. The standard remedy is to add the consensus (redundant) product term formed by multiplying the remaining literals of the two implicated terms after removing the toggling variable and its complement.\n\nIdentify the pair of product terms and the toggling variable:\n- The two terms are $A'B'$ and $BC$.\n- They are of the form $X'Z$ and $XY$, where $X=B$, $Z=A'$, and $Y=C$. A static-1 hazard can occur when the variable distinguishing the two terms, $B$ in this case, changes.\n\nForm the consensus term by applying the consensus theorem, $X'Z + XY \\to YZ$:\n- With $X=B$, $Y=C$, and $Z=A'$, the consensus term is $A'C$.\n\nThis term covers the adjacent 1-cells where $A=0$ and $C=1$ while $B$ toggles, thereby preventing the static-1 hazard. Adding it yields\n$$F_{\\text{hazard-free}}=A'B' + BC + A'C,$$\nwhich is functionally equivalent to the original (by the consensus theorem), but removes the hazard.\n\nTherefore, the required single redundant product term is $A'C$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A'C}$$", "id": "1929345"}, {"introduction": "As functions grow in complexity, a more visual and systematic method for hazard detection becomes essential. This practice moves to a four-variable function where you will use a Karnaugh map not just for minimization, but as a diagnostic tool.

The function is specified by the sum of its minterms, where a minterm $m_i$ corresponds to the input combination whose binary representation (with A as the most significant bit) is equal to $i$.

This term must be chosen such that it covers all potential static-1 hazards present in the minimal design. Your task is to find this specific hazard-covering product term. The term must use the minimum possible number of literals.\n\nWhat is this redundant product term? Write your answer as a product of variables (e.g., $A'B$, $BCD$), with variables appearing in alphabetical order.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we will use a Karnaugh map (K-map) to visualize the function and identify the hazards. Then, we will determine the single product term needed to eliminate them.\n\n**Step 1: Construct the Karnaugh Map**\n\nWe create a 4-variable K-map for $F(A,B,C,D)$ and place a '1' in the cells corresponding to the given minterms: 3 (0011), 7 (0111), 10 (1010), 11 (1011), 12 (1100), 14 (1110), and 15 (1111). The K-map is structured with variables $AB$ for rows and $CD$ for columns, using Gray code ordering.\n\nThe resulting K-map is:\n```\n      CD\n   AB 00  01  11  10\n   00  0   0   1   0   (m3)\n   01  0   0   1   0   (m7)\n   11  1   0   1   1   (m12, m15, m14)\n   10  0   0   1   1   (m11, m10)\n```\n\n**Step 2: Find a Minimal Sum-of-Products (SOP) Expression**\n\nWe find a minimal SOP by grouping the 1s into the largest possible rectangular groups of size $2^k$. We must first identify the essential prime implicants (EPIs).\n\n- The minterm $m_3$ (0011) can only be covered by the group of four consisting of {3, 7, 11, 15}. This gives the term $CD$. Thus, $CD$ is an EPI.\n- The minterm $m_{12}$ (1100) can only be covered by the group of two consisting of {12, 14}. This gives the term $ABD'$. Thus, $ABD'$ is an EPI.\n\nThe EPIs $CD$ and $ABD'$ cover the minterms {3, 7, 11, 15, 12, 14}. The only remaining uncovered minterm is $m_{10}$ (1010).\n\nTo cover $m_{10}$, we can group it with the adjacent minterm $m_{11}$ (1011). This forms the group {10, 11}, which gives the term $AB'C$.\n\nOne possible minimal SOP expression is therefore $F_{min} = CD + ABD' + AB'C$.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Static-1 Hazards**\n\nA static-1 hazard can exist if two adjacent 1s on the K-map are not covered by the same product term in the SOP expression. Let's examine the adjacencies for $F_{min}$:\n- Group 1 ($CD$): {3, 7, 11, 15}\n- Group 2 ($ABD'$): {12, 14}\n- Group 3 ($AB'C$): {10, 11}\n\nWe check transitions between adjacent 1s:\n- Transition between $m_{10}$ (1010) and $m_{14}$ (1110): $m_{10}$ is covered by $AB'C$ (Group 3), while $m_{14}$ is covered by $ABD'$ (Group 2). Since they are in different groups, this transition is a **static-1 hazard**.\n- Transition between $m_{14}$ (1110) and $m_{15}$ (1111): $m_{14}$ is covered by $ABD'$ (Group 2), while $m_{15}$ is covered by $CD$ (Group 1). Since they are in different groups, this transition is also a **static-1 hazard**.\n\nAll other adjacent 1s share at least one group. For example, $m_{10}$ and $m_{11}$ are adjacent and both covered by $AB'C$. Also, $m_{11}$ and $m_{15}$ are adjacent and both covered by $CD$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Hazard-Covering Term**\n\nTo eliminate all static-1 hazards, every pair of adjacent 1s must be covered by a common product term. We need to add a term (or terms) to cover the hazardous transitions we identified.\n- The hazard between $m_{10}$ and $m_{14}$ requires a term that covers both minterms.\n- The hazard between $m_{14}$ and $m_{15}$ requires a term that covers both minterms.\n\nThe problem asks for a *single* product term to cover all hazards. Such a term must therefore cover the set of minterms {10, 14, 15}.\n\nLooking at the K-map, we search for a valid rectangular grouping that includes {10, 14, 15}. The largest such group is the 2x2 square formed by minterms {10, 11, 14, 15}.\n- $m_{10}$ (1010)\n- $m_{11}$ (1011)\n- $m_{14}$ (1110)\n- $m_{15}$ (1111)\n\nFor this group, variable $A=1$ and variable $C=1$ are constant, while $B$ and $D$ change. The product term for this group is $AC$.\n\nThis term $AC$ covers both hazardous transitions:\n- It covers the pair ($m_{10}, m_{14}$).\n- It covers the pair ($m_{14}, m_{15}$).\n\nAdding this term to the minimal SOP gives the hazard-free expression: $F_{hf} = CD + ABD' + AB'C + AC$. The term $AC$ is logically redundant because all the minterms it covers ({10, 11, 14, 15}) are already covered by the original three terms.\n\nThe term must have the minimum possible number of literals. The term $AC$ corresponds to the largest possible group (a group of 4) that contains the required minterms {10, 14, 15}. A larger group implies fewer literals. Therefore, $AC$, with two literals, is the required term.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "1929350"}, {"introduction": "Our focus so far has been on static-1 hazards in SOP circuits, but this is only half the story.

The zeros of $F$ are the remaining minterms:\n$$\n\\{0,1,2,3,8,9,12,13\\}.\n$$\nThe two sum terms of our minimal POS expression correspond to two groups of zeros:\n- $W + X = 0$ when $W=0$, $X=0$.

This is also a hazard.\n- $m2(0010)$ has no adjacent zero in the second group.\n- $m3(0011)$ has no adjacent zero in the second group.\n\nTo eliminate these hazards, we must add a redundant sum term that covers the adjacencies.
