An **even parity** scheme requires that the total number of '1's in the transmitted word (the original data plus the parity bit) be an even number.\n\nYou are tasked with designing an even parity generator for a 4-bit data word, denoted as $D_3D_2D_1D_0$. Your design must be implemented using only 2-input XNOR gates. You may assume that the logic constants '0' (LOW) and '1' (HIGH) are available to be used as inputs to these gates.\n\nLet the 2-input XNOR operation be represented by the symbol $\\odot$.

To enable basic error detection, an odd parity bit is generated for each 3-bit word. Let the three input bits of the data word be represented by the variables $A$, $B$, and $C$. The output is the odd parity bit, $P_{odd}$.\n\nThe logic for an odd parity generator is as follows: the value of $P_{odd}$ is set such that the total number of '1's in the four bits (the original three data bits $A, B, C$ plus the parity bit $P_{odd}$) is odd.\n\nYour task is twofold:\n1. First, derive the minimal Product-of-Sums (POS) expression for the odd parity bit, $P_{odd}$, as a function of the inputs $A$, $B$, and $C$.\n2. Second, based on the function you derived, determine the minimum number of 2-input NAND gates required for its hardware implementation.\n\nProvide a single integer representing this minimum number of gates as your final answer.", "solution": "The parity requirement implies that the parity bit must be set so that the total number of ones in $A$, $B$, $C$, and $P_{odd}$ is odd. Therefore $P_{odd}=1$ exactly when the number of ones in $A$, $B$, $C$ is even, and $P_{odd}=0$ when it is odd. In Boolean algebra this is\n$$\nP_{odd}=\\overline{A \\oplus B \\oplus C}.\n$$\nEquivalently, $P_{odd}=1$ for input combinations with even parity of $(A,B,C)$, namely for minterms $m_{0}(000)$, $m_{3}(011)$, $m_{5}(101)$, and $m_{6}(110)$, and $P_{odd}=0$ for minterms $m_{1}(001)$, $m_{2}(010)$, $m_{4}(100)$, and $m_{7}(111)$.\n\nTo derive the minimal Product-of-Sums (POS), we form the product of maxterms corresponding to the zeros. For each zero at $(A,B,C)=(a,b,c)$, the associated maxterm is $(X+Y+Z)$ where $X=A$ if $a=0$ and $X=\\bar{A}$ if $a=1$, similarly for $Y$ from $B$ and $Z$ from $C$. Thus, for the four zero points:\n- At $(0,0,1)$ we get $(A+B+\\bar{C})$,\n- At $(0,1,0)$ we get $(A+\\bar{B}+C)$,\n- At $(1,0,0)$ we get $(\\bar{A}+B+C)$,\n- At $(1,1,1)$ we get $(\\bar{A}+\\bar{B}+\\bar{C})$.\nHence the canonical POS is\n$$\nP_{odd}=(A+B+\\bar{C})(A+\\bar{B}+C)(\\bar{A}+B+C)(\\bar{A}+\\bar{B}+\\bar{C}).\n$$\nA Karnaugh-map check shows that no two zeros are adjacent, so no grouping is possible; therefore this canonical POS is already minimal.\n\nFor the minimum number of 2-input NAND gates to implement $P_{odd}$, it is most efficient to exploit $P_{odd}=\\overline{A \\oplus B \\oplus C}$. A 2-input XOR requires at least four 2-input NAND gates. We can compute $Y = A \\oplus B \\oplus C$ by cascading two 2-input XOR circuits, which requires $4+4=8$ NAND gates. Then, we need to find the complement, $P_{odd} = \\overline{Y}$. This inversion requires one additional NAND gate.

Compute $Y = U \\oplus C$ using another four 2-input NAND gates.\n3. Compute $P_{odd} = \\overline{Y}$ using one 2-input NAND gate (with inputs tied together).\n\nHence, the minimal POS is\n$$\nP_{odd}=(A+B+\\bar{C})(A+\\bar{B}+C)(\\bar{A}+B+C)(\\bar{A}+\\bar{B}+\\bar{C}),\n$$\nand the minimum number of 2-input NAND gates required is $9$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9}$$", "id": "1951279"}, {"introduction": "Truly elegant digital design often comes from understanding the fundamental properties of logical operations, which can turn a seemingly complex problem into a simple one. This final thought experiment [@problem_id:1951242] presents a scenario where a parity bit must be calculated for a data word that is dynamically rotated. Before diving into designing complex barrel shifters and multiplexers, consider the inherent nature of the parity calculation itself; its properties might reveal a surprising simplification and a powerful design lesson.", "problem": "A specialized digital signal processing unit is designed to perform a conditional rotation and parity calculation on a 4-bit data word. The unit takes two inputs: a 4-bit data word $D$ with bits represented as $D_3D_2D_1D_0$, where $D_3$ is the most significant bit (MSB), and a 2-bit control signal $S$ with bits $S_1S_0$, where $S_1$ is the MSB.\n\nThe operation proceeds in two stages. First, the data word $D$ is logically rotated to the left by a number of positions determined by the binary value of the control signal $S$. For example, if $S = 01_2 = 1_{10}$, the word $D_3D_2D_1D_0$ becomes $D_2D_1D_0D_3$. In a logical rotation, bits shifted out from the MSB are inserted into the least significant bit (LSB) position.\n\nSecond, the unit generates a single odd parity bit, $P$, for the resulting 4-bit rotated word. An odd parity system is one where the parity bit is set to 1 if the number of ones in the data word is even, and to 0 if the number of ones is odd, such that the total count of ones in the data word combined with the parity bit is always odd.\n\nYour task is to derive the simplified Boolean expression for the odd parity bit $P$ as a function of the six input bits: $D_3, D_2, D_1, D_0, S_1,$ and $S_0$.", "solution": "Let $D$ be the 4-bit word with bits $D_{3}D_{2}D_{1}D_{0}$ and let $S$ be the 2-bit control with bits $S_{1}S_{0}$.

Let the rotated word be $R$, with bits $R_{3}R_{2}R_{1}R_{0}$.\n\nAn odd parity bit $P$ is set such that the total number of ones in the word $R$ together with $P$ is odd. This means that $P$ must be the complement of the even parity function of $R$. The even parity function is the exclusive-OR (XOR) sum of the bits. Therefore,\n$$\nP = \\overline{R_{3} \\oplus R_{2} \\oplus R_{1} \\oplus R_{0}}.\n$$\nThe key insight is that a logical rotation is simply a permutation of the bit positions. The XOR operation is both commutative and associative. This means the order in which the bits are summed does not affect the final result.\n$$\nR_{3} \\oplus R_{2} \\oplus R_{1} \\oplus R_{0} = D_{3} \\oplus D_{2} \\oplus D_{1} \\oplus D_{0}\n$$\nFor example, if $S = 01_2$ (a rotation of 1), the rotated word is $D_2D_1D_0D_3$. The XOR sum is $D_2 \\oplus D_1 \\oplus D_0 \\oplus D_3$, which is identical to the XOR sum of the original word.\n\nBecause the XOR sum of the bits is invariant under rotation, the odd parity bit calculation depends only on the original data bits, not on the amount of rotation. The control signals $S_1$ and $S_0$, which determine the rotation amount, have no influence on the final parity bit.\n\nTherefore, the simplified Boolean expression for the odd parity bit $P$ is:\n$$\nP = \\overline{D_{3} \\oplus D_{2} \\oplus D_{1} \\oplus D_{0}}.\n$$\nThis expression is fully simplified and correctly represents the function in terms of the six inputs, showing no dependence on $S_{1}$ or $S_{0}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\overline{D_{3}\\oplus D_{2}\\oplus D_{1}\\oplus D_{0}}}$$", "id": "1951242"}]}
