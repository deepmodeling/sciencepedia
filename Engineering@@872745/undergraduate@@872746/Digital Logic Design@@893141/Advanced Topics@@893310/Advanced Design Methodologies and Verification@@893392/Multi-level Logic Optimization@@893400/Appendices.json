A common metric for cost is the literal count. A literal is a single occurrence of a variable or its complement in a Boolean expression. The literal count of an expression is the sum of all literals.

The remaining on-set points $\\{0000,0001,1000\\}$ are exactly described by $b'c'$ except for the single excluded point $1001$; excluding that point minimally requires mentioning both $a'$ and $d'$ once in a sum, yielding the factor $b'c'(a'+d')$ with $4$ literals.
