By analyzing a received codeword, you will practice identifying whether it conforms to a specified odd parity scheme, a foundational skill for understanding error detection mechanisms. This problem [@problem_id:1951688] will solidify your grasp of how a simple parity checker flags potential transmission errors.", "problem": "In a simplified digital communication system, a transmitter sends 4-bit data words to a receiver. To allow for basic error detection, the transmitter calculates and appends a single parity bit to each 4-bit word, forming a 5-bit codeword for transmission. The system is configured to use an odd parity scheme. In this scheme, the value of the parity bit is chosen such that the total number of '1's in the 5-bit codeword (the 4 data bits plus the 1 parity bit) is always an odd number.\n\nThe receiver contains an odd parity checker circuit. This circuit continuously monitors the incoming 5-bit codewords. It outputs an \"Error Flag\" which is set to a logic '1' if the received codeword violates the odd parity rule (i.e., if the total count of '1's is even). If the received codeword adheres to the odd parity rule, the Error Flag is set to a logic '0'.\n\nSuppose the 5-bit codeword received is `10110`. Which of the following statements correctly describes the status of the Error Flag?\n\nA. The Error Flag is 1. An odd number of '1's was received, which signals an error in an odd parity system.\n\nB. The Error Flag is 0. The total count of '1's in the received word is 3, which is an odd number, thus satisfying the odd parity rule.\n\nC. The Error Flag is 1. The original data must have contained an even number of '1's, so the received word is incorrect.\n\nD. The Error Flag is 0. For an odd parity scheme, an even number of '1's in the received word indicates no error.\n\nE. The Error Flag is 1. The parity bit, which is the last bit, is 0. For the data `1011`, the parity bit should have been 1 to achieve odd parity.", "solution": "Interpret the odd parity rule: the total number of ones in the 5-bit codeword must be odd. Let the received 5-bit codeword be 10110. Count the number of ones:\n$$\nN_{1} = 3.\n$$\nSince $N_{1}$ is odd, the received word adheres to the odd parity rule.\n\nDefine the Error Flag $F$ to reflect the receiver’s rule: it outputs $F=1$ if the received codeword violates odd parity (i.e., if the total count of ones is even), and $F=0$ otherwise. Formally,\n$$\nF=\\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if } N_{1} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2},\\\\\n0, & \\text{if } N_{1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nWith $N_{1}=3$, we have $N_{1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$, so\n$$\nF=0.\n$$\nTherefore, the correct statement is: the Error Flag is 0 because the total count of ones is 3, which is odd and satisfies the odd parity rule. This corresponds to option B. For completeness, note that option E is incorrect because for data 1011 (which already has three ones), the parity bit should be 0 in an odd parity scheme, consistent with the received last bit being 0.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1951688"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple bit-counting, this problem explores a more abstract and powerful property of parity. You will determine the parity of a larger word formed by concatenating two smaller words with known parities, without needing to know their specific bit patterns. This exercise [@problem_id:1951665] demonstrates the algebraic nature of parity, which is rooted in the properties of the XOR operation and is crucial for designing more complex systems.", "problem": "In a simplified model of a data communication system, information is transmitted in binary words. A commonly used method for error detection is parity checking. A binary word is said to have *odd parity* if it contains an odd number of '1's. Conversely, it has *even parity* if it contains an even number of '1's.\n\nConsider two independent binary words, $W_1$ and $W_2$. The word $W_1$ is 3 bits long and is known to have odd parity. The word $W_2$ is 5 bits long and also has odd parity. A new 8-bit word, $W_c$, is formed by concatenating these two words, with $W_1$ forming the most significant bits and $W_2$ forming the least significant bits.\n\nWhat is the parity of the concatenated word $W_c$?\n\nA. Odd Parity\n\nB. Even Parity\n\nC. The parity cannot be determined without knowing the specific bit patterns of $W_1$ and $W_2$.\n\nD. The concept of parity is not applicable to the concatenated word.", "solution": "Define the parity function of a binary word $W$ as $p(W) \\in \\{0,1\\}$, where $p(W)=0$ denotes even parity and $p(W)=1$ denotes odd parity. Let $n(W)$ denote the number of $1$'s in $W$. By definition, $p(W) \\equiv n(W) \\pmod{2}$.\n\nLet $W_1$ be a 3-bit word with odd parity and $W_2$ be a 5-bit word with odd parity. Then their counts of $1$'s satisfy\n$$\nn(W_1) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}, \\quad n(W_2) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}.\n$$\n\nThe concatenated word $W_c$ contains exactly all bits of $W_1$ followed by all bits of $W_2$, so the total number of $1$'s in $W_c$ is\n$$\nn(W_c) = n(W_1) + n(W_2).\n$$\nTaking parity (i.e., reducing modulo $2$),\n$$\np(W_c) \\equiv n(W_c) \\equiv n(W_1) + n(W_2) \\equiv 1 + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}.\n$$\nThus $W_c$ has even parity. Equivalently, parity under concatenation adds modulo $2$, so $p(W_c) = p(W_1) \\oplus p(W_2)$; with both odd ($1$), the result is even ($0$).

The circuit takes three inputs, $A$, $B$, and $C$, and produces a single output $P$. The output $P$ must be logic '1' if an odd number of inputs are '1', and logic '0' otherwise. The design specification requires a modular, cascaded architecture: a first module computes an intermediate result $Z = A \\oplus B$ (where $\\oplus$ denotes the Exclusive-OR operation), and a second module computes the final output $P = Z \\oplus C$. Each of these two modules must be implemented using an optimal, minimal number of 2-input NOR gates. Determine the total number of 2-input NOR gates required to build the complete 3-bit parity generator according to this design.", "solution": "We must implement two cascaded modules using only 2-input NOR gates, each module computing a 2-input Exclusive-OR (XOR): first $Z=A \\oplus B$, then $P=Z \\oplus C$. The total number of NOR gates equals the sum of the minimal NOR counts for the two XOR modules, so it suffices to determine the minimal number of 2-input NOR gates needed to realize a 2-input XOR.\n\nLet the 2-input NOR operation be denoted by $X \\downarrow Y = (X+Y)'$, where $+$ is OR, juxtaposition is AND, and $'$ is NOT.

This is optimal, because with four 2-input NOR gates the best we can realize in this structure is XNOR; producing XOR requires one additional inversion, which necessarily adds at least one more NOR gate.\n\nApplying this to the specified modular architecture:\n- First module computes $Z = A \\oplus B$ using $5$ NOR gates.\n- Second module computes $P = Z \\oplus C$ using $5$ NOR gates.\n\nSince the modules are cascaded and modular (no sharing of internal nodes across modules), the total number of 2-input NOR gates is $5 + 5 = 10$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10}$$", "id": "1951690"}]}
