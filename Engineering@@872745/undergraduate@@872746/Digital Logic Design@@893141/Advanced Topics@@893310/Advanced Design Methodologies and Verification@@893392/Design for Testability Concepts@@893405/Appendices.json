The circuit has four inputs, designated A, B, C, and D, and a single output, F. The logical function is described by the Boolean expression:\nF(A, B, C, D) = (A AND (NOT B)) OR (C AND D).\n\nTo ensure reliability, a test procedure is developed based on the single stuck-at fault model. In this model, a fault is a single line in the circuit being permanently stuck at a logical 0 (stuck-at-0) or a logical 1 (stuck-at-1). For your analysis, consider the complete set of possible stuck-at faults on the four primary inputs (A, B, C, D) and the single primary output (F). Additionally, consider the faults at the outputs of the two intermediate AND gates. Let G1 be the output of (A AND (NOT B)) and G2 be the output of (C AND D), so the function is F = G1 OR G2. The fault list must also include stuck-at-0 and stuck-at-1 faults for G1 and G2.\n\nThe following set of three test patterns is applied to the circuit's inputs:\n1.  (A, B, C, D) = (1, 0, 0, 0)\n2.
