The fan-out is the maximum number of inputs that a single output can reliably drive. This is limited by the current sourcing and sinking capabilities of the driving gate. We must calculate the fan-out for both the HIGH logic state and the LOW logic state and then choose the smaller of the two values, as the connection must be reliable under all conditions.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the High-Level Fan-Out ($N_H$)**\n\nWhen the output of the driving gate is at a HIGH logic level, it sources current to the inputs of the driven gates. The total current sourced by the driver, $|I_{OH}|$, must be greater than or equal to the sum of the currents required by all the driven inputs, $N_H \\times |I_{IH}|$.\n\nThe high-level fan-out, $N_H$, is therefore given by the ratio of the driver's maximum output source current to the load's required input current. Since the number of gates must be an integer, we take the floor of this ratio.\n\n$$N_H = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{|I_{OH}|}{|I_{IH}|} \\right\\rfloor$$\n\nUsing the provided values:\n$|I_{OH}| = |-400 \\, \\mu\\text{A}| = 400 \\, \\mu\\text{A}$\n$|I_{IH}| = |20 \\, \\mu\\text{A}| = 20 \\, \\mu\\text{A}$\n\n$$N_H = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{400 \\, \\mu\\text{A}}{20 \\, \\mu\\text{A}} \\right\\rfloor = \\lfloor 20 \\rfloor = 20$$\n\nSo, in the HIGH state, the driver can support a maximum of 20 LS-TTL inputs.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Low-Level Fan-Out ($N_L$)**\n\nWhen the output of the driving gate is at a LOW logic level, it sinks current from the inputs of the driven gates. The total current that the driver can sink, $|I_{OL}|$, must be greater than or equal to the sum of the currents flowing from all the driven inputs, $N_L \\times |I_{IL}|$.\n\nThe low-level fan-out, $N_L$, is given by the ratio of the driver's maximum output sink current to the load's input current. Again, we take the floor of the ratio.\n\n$$N_L = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{|I_{OL}|}{|I_{IL}|} \\right\\rfloor$$\n\nUsing the provided values, we must first ensure the units are consistent. We will convert milliamperes (mA) to microamperes (µA) where $1 \\, \\text{mA} = 1000 \\, \\mu\\text{A}$.\n$|I_{OL}| = |16 \\, \\text{mA}| = 16 \\, \\text{mA} = 16000 \\, \\mu\\text{A}$\n$|I_{IL}| = |-360 \\, \\mu\\text{A}| = 360 \\, \\mu\\text{A}$\n\n$$N_L = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{16000 \\, \\mu\\text{A}}{360 \\, \\mu\\text{A}} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1600}{36} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{400}{9} \\right\\rfloor = \\lfloor 44.44... \\rfloor = 44$$\n\nSo, in the LOW state, the driver can support a maximum of 44 LS-TTL inputs.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Overall Fan-Out**\n\nThe circuit must operate reliably in both the HIGH and LOW states. Therefore, the maximum number of gates that can be driven is limited by the worst-case scenario. This is the minimum of the high-level fan-out and the low-level fan-out.\n\n$$N = \\min(N_H, N_L)$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n\n$$N = \\min(20, 44) = 20$$\n\nThus, the standard TTL gate can reliably drive a maximum of 20 LS-TTL inputs. Although it could sink the current from 44 inputs in the LOW state, it can only source enough current for 20 inputs in the HIGH state, making the high-level condition the limiting factor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{20}$$", "id": "1934517"}]}
