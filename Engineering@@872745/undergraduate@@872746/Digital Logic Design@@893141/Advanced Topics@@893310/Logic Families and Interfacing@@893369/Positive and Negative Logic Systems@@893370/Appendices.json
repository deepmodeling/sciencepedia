The physical behavior of this gate is defined by its voltage levels: the output Y is at a High voltage level if and only if both input A and input B are at a Low voltage level. For all other combinations of input voltage levels, the output Y is at a Low voltage level.\n\nIn digital systems, these voltage levels are interpreted as logic values. Two common conventions are used:\n1.  **Positive Logic**: A High voltage level represents a logic '1', and a Low voltage level represents a logic '0'.\n2.  **Negative Logic**: A High voltage level represents a logic '0', and a Low voltage level represents a logic '1'.\n\nBased on the physical behavior of the gate, determine its equivalent standard logic function under both positive and negative logic conventions.

Symbolically, with voltage levels only, this is $Y=H$ iff $A=L$ and $B=L$; else $Y=L$.\n\nUnder positive logic, map $H\\mapsto 1$ and $L\\mapsto 0$. Let $A^{+},B^{+},Y^{+}\\in\\{0,1\\}$.

A physical 2-input NOR gate $N$ is defined on voltages by\n$$\nN(p,q)=\\begin{cases}\nV_{H}, & \\text{iff } p=V_{L} \\text{ and } q=V_{L},\\\\\nV_{L}, & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nStep 1: Logical function implemented by a single physical NOR under negative logic.\nGiven logical inputs $A,B\\in\\{0,1\\}$ (in negative logic), the logical function realized by one physical NOR is\n$$\nf(A,B)=M^{-1}\\!\\big(N(M(A),M(B))\\big).\n$$\nSince $N(M(A),M(B))=V_{H}$ iff $M(A)=V_{L}$ and $M(B)=V_{L}$, i.e., iff $A=1$ and $B=1$, it follows that\n$$\nf(A,B)=\\begin{cases}\n0, & \\text{if } A=1 \\text{ and } B=1,\\\\\n1, & \\text{otherwise},\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nhence\n$$\nf(A,B)=\\overline{A\\cdot B}.\n$$\nTherefore, a single physical NOR produces the NAND of the negative-logic inputs, not the AND. Thus option A is incorrect and at least two gates are required.\n\nStep 2: Using two NOR gates, with the second as an inverter.\nLet the first NOR output be $Y=N(M(A),M(B))$, which realizes $f(A,B)=\\overline{A\\cdot B}$ as shown above. Feed $Y$ into both inputs of a second NOR: $Z=N(Y,Y)$.

This matches option B.\n\nStep 3: Minimality and elimination of other options.\n- One NOR gate yields $\\overline{A\\cdot B}$, not $A\\cdot B$, so A is false and at least two gates are necessary.\n- Two gates suffice, as shown, so B is correct and minimal.\n- Three-gate construction (option C) is a standard positive-logic AND-from-NOR realization but is not minimal here.\n- Four gates (option D) are unnecessary.\n- It is not impossible (option E is false).\n\nTherefore the correct and most efficient implementation is described by option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1953095"}, {"introduction": "Why is a deep understanding of different logic systems so critical in practice? This final exercise demonstrates the real-world stakes by presenting a system integration problem involving bus contention.

Therefore, TA is enabled if and only if $v(EA)=V_{H}$.\n- For buffer TB: EB is an active-low enable under negative logic, where logic 1 is represented by $V_{L}$ and logic 0 by $V_{H}$.
