The first inverter, which drives node $Q$, is composed of a PMOS pull-up transistor, $M_{P1}$, and an NMOS pull-down transistor, $M_{N1}$. The input to this first inverter is connected to node $\\bar{Q}$.

The access transistors are off because the word line is low, so there is no conduction to the bit-lines. The stuck-open fault means $M_{P1}$ provides identically zero current for all biases, i.e., $I_{P1} \\equiv 0$. The conduction conditions are:\n- For an NMOS, on if $V_{GS} \\ge V_{TN}$.\n- For a PMOS, on if $V_{SG} \\ge |V_{TP}|$.\n\nA DC steady state requires constant node voltages, so capacitive currents vanish, and each node’s voltage must be enforced by at least one conducting path consistent with transistor states; a purely floating node cannot be maintained at a nontrivial value in steady state in the presence of leakage.\n\nConsider candidate steady states.\n\nCase 1: $V_{Q} \\approx 0$, $V_{\\bar{Q}} \\approx V_{DD}$. Then for inverter 1: the input is $V_{\\bar{Q}} \\approx V_{DD}$, hence $V_{GS,N1} = V_{\\bar{Q}} - V_{Q} \\approx V_{DD} \\ge V_{TN}$, so $M_{N1}$ is on and provides a conducting path that pulls $Q$ to $0$. Since $M_{P1}$ is stuck open, there is no pull-up, but it is not needed because $M_{N1}$ actively enforces $V_{Q} \\approx 0$. For inverter 2: the input is $V_{Q} \\approx 0$, hence $V_{GS,N2} \\approx 0 < V_{TN}$ so $M_{N2}$ is off, while $V_{SG,P2} = V_{DD} - 0 = V_{DD} \\ge |V_{TP}|$ so $M_{P2}$ is on and pulls $\\bar{Q}$ up to $V_{DD}$. There is no path from $V_{DD}$ to ground through a single inverter because in inverter 1 only the NMOS is on and in inverter 2 only the PMOS is on. This is a self-consistent, stable fixed point.\n\nCase 2: $V_{Q} \\approx V_{DD}$, $V_{\\bar{Q}} \\approx 0$. For inverter 2: with $V_{Q} \\approx V_{DD}$, $V_{GS,N2} \\approx V_{DD} \\ge V_{TN}$, so $M_{N2}$ is on, $M_{P2}$ is off, and $\\bar{Q}$ is pulled to ground, consistent. For inverter 1: with $V_{\\bar{Q}} \\approx 0$, $V_{GS,N1} \\approx 0 < V_{TN}$ so $M_{N1}$ is off, and $M_{P1}$ is stuck open with $I_{P1} \\equiv 0$. Therefore node $Q$ has no DC pull-up path and no DC pull-down path; it is floating. A DC steady state requires $dV_{Q}/dt = 0$ and that the node voltage be enforced by conduction, which is impossible here. Any leakage current that causes $V_{Q}$ to drop below the threshold for $M_{N2}$ will turn $M_{N2}$ off, after which $M_{P2}$ turns on and drives $V_{\\bar{Q}}$ to $V_{DD}$, which then turns $M_{N1}$ on and drives $V_{Q}$ to $0$, converging to Case 1. Thus Case 2 is not a stable attractor.\n\nBy elimination, the only stable state is $V_{Q} \\approx 0$, $V_{\\bar{Q}} \\approx V_{DD}$, i.e., the cell stores a logic '0' at $Q$ and a logic '1' at $\\bar{Q}$. This rules out the other options: the state is not indeterminate (C), not oscillatory (D) because there is no active loop gain with alternating conduction to sustain oscillations, and not a static short (E) since in the stable state each inverter has only one device conducting and there is no direct $V_{DD}$-to-GND path.\n\nTherefore the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1963488"}, {"introduction": "While holding data is crucial, an SRAM cell must also allow its state to be read without being corrupted.

During a read, both bitlines are precharged to $V_{DD}$ and the wordline is asserted to $V_{DD}$, turning on the access NMOS connected to the $V_{x}$ node. This creates a contention between:\n- the access NMOS that tends to raise $V_{x}$ toward $V_{DD}$, and\n- the pull-down NMOS of the inverter connected to $V_{x}$ that pulls $V_{x}$ toward $0$.\n\nLet the access NMOS have parameter $k_{ax}$ and threshold $V_{th,ax}$, and the pull-down NMOS have parameter $k_{pd}$ and threshold $V_{th,pd}$.

The cell consists of two cross-coupled CMOS inverters forming a bistable latch, and two n-channel Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (nMOS) pass-gate transistors for access. The first inverter, with output node Q and input node QB, is formed by a p-channel MOS (pMOS) pull-up transistor (PU1) and an nMOS pull-down transistor (PD1). The second inverter, with output node QB and input node Q, is formed by a pMOS pull-up transistor (PU2) and an nMOS pull-down transistor (PD2).

The two access transistors PG1 and PG2 (nMOS) connect BL to $Q$ and BLB to $QB$ respectively when $WL=V_{DD}$. The pull-ups PU1 and PU2 are pMOS, the pull-downs PD1 and PD2 are nMOS. The condition \"pass-gates stronger than pull-ups\" means, in terms of on-resistance, $R_{on,PG}<R_{on,PU}$, or in current terms the access device can source/sink a larger magnitude of current than the pMOS pull-up at comparable gate/drain biases. Also, an nMOS pass transistor passes a strong zero and a degraded one.\n\nA standard read begins by precharging both bit-lines to $V_{DD}$, then asserting $WL$ so the cell weakly discharges the bit-line connected to the internal zero node through its pull-down plus pass-gate, creating a small differential, and then de-asserting $WL$ before the internal node crosses the inverter trip point. That sequence corresponds to option B and is non-destructive.\n\nA destructive read, as defined, must begin like a standard read (precharge both BL and BLB to $V_{DD}$, assert $WL$), but then manipulate the bit-lines while $WL$ remains asserted to force the latch to flip from $Q=V_{DD}$, $QB=0$ to $Q=0$, $QB=V_{DD}$.\n\nTo flip the cell starting from $Q=V_{DD}$, we must force $Q$ below the switching threshold $V_{M1}$ of the inverter formed by PU1 and PD1. Symbolically, when $WL=V_{DD}$, the node $Q$ is connected to BL through PG1. If BL is actively driven to GND while $WL$ is high, the node equation at $Q$ under quasi-static conditions is\n$$\nI_{PG1}(V_{G}=V_{DD},V_{S}=V_{BL}=0,V_{D}=V_{Q}) + I_{PU1}(V_{S}=V_{DD},V_{D}=V_{Q},V_{G}=V_{QB}) = 0,\n$$\nwith current directions defined into node $Q$. Because an nMOS pass transistor passes a strong zero and $R_{on,PG1}<R_{on,PU1}$, the effective voltage division strongly favors pulling $Q$ toward $0$, yielding $V_{Q}$ sufficiently below $V_{M1}$. When $V_{Q}<V_{M1}$, the cross-coupled inverter action causes $QB$ to rise: PD1 turns off and PU2 turns on, so\n$$\nV_{Q} \\downarrow \\implies \\text{PU2 on, PD2 off} \\implies V_{QB} \\uparrow \\rightarrow V_{DD}.\n$$\nSimultaneously, with $V_{QB}$ rising, PU1 turns off harder and PD1 turns on, reinforcing the transition of $Q$ downward. Once the latch has crossed its metastable point, it regeneratively settles to the new stable state $Q=0$, $QB=V_{DD}$. After de-asserting $WL$, the cell retains this flipped value. Thus, actively driving BL to GND during the asserted $WL$ after a read-like precharge produces a destructive read that writes a '0'.\n\nNow we verify each option against this mechanism:\n\n- Option D: Pre-charge both BL and BLB to $V_{DD}$; assert WL; while WL remains asserted, drive BL to GND; de-assert WL. This matches the above derivation: PG1 connects BL to $Q$, and driving BL to GND while WL is high pulls $Q$ below $V_{M1}$ due to $R_{on,PG1}<R_{on,PU1}$, flipping the cell to $Q=0$, $QB=V_{DD}$. This is a destructive read of the initial '1'.\n\n- Option C: Pre-charge to $V_{DD}$; assert WL; while WL remains asserted, drive BLB to GND; de-assert WL. Here PG2 connects BLB to $QB$, which is already at $0$. Driving BLB to GND reinforces $QB=0$ (nMOS passes a strong zero) and does not pull $Q$ down. The latch remains in '1'; no destructive flip occurs.\n\n- Option B: This is the standard non-destructive read: both lines precharged, assert WL, sense small differential, de-assert WL. No intentional forcing, so no flip.\n\n- Option A: Driving BL to GND and BLB to $V_{DD}$ before asserting WL is a direct write-'0' operation, not one that \"begins like a standard read cycle\" (no symmetric precharge first). Although it will flip the cell, it does not satisfy the requirement.\n\n- Option E: De-asserting WL before driving BL to GND isolates the internal nodes; with PG1 off, changing BL cannot affect $Q$, so no flip occurs.\n\nTherefore, the only sequence that both begins like a standard read and intentionally forces the cell into a logic '0' by manipulating the bit-line connected to the initially high node during WL assertion is option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1963484"}]}
