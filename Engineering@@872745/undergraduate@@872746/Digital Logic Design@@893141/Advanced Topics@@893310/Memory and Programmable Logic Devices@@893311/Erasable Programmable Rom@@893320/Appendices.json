This problem explores the unique nature of EPROM programming, where an initial UV erasure sets all bits to a logic '1' and a programming process selectively changes them to '0'. By navigating a hypothetical programmer's logic, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the interplay between the desired logical data and the physical charge-trapping mechanism. [@problem_id:1932883]", "problem": "A digital systems engineer is tasked with patching the firmware of a legacy device that uses an 8-bit Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EPROM) chip. The EPROM stores data in memory cells, where each cell is a special Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) with a floating gate.\n\nBefore programming, the entire memory chip is exposed to ultraviolet light, which erases it. This erasing process removes any trapped electrical charge from the floating gates, setting every memory cell in the chip to a default state of logic '1'. To store data, a programming device is used. A cell is programmed by applying a high voltage, which injects and traps electrons in its floating gate. This trapped charge changes the cell's state from logic '1' to logic '0'.\n\nThe engineer needs to program a single 8-bit memory location to store the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) representation of the character 'K'. The 8-bit ASCII code for 'K' is `0x4B`.\n\nHowever, the available EPROM programmer has a peculiar, non-standard interface logic. For each of the 8 data input lines (D7 down to D0), the programmer's internal circuit generates a high-voltage programming pulse if and only if the corresponding data input line is set to logic '1'. If a data input line is at logic '0', no pulse is generated for that bit, and the corresponding memory cell remains in its erased state.\n\nDetermine the 8-bit value that must be supplied to the programmer's data input lines (D7-D0) to correctly store the character 'K' in the EPROM.

The programmer generates a programming pulse iff the input bit is $1$, and a programming pulse changes the cell to logic $0$. Therefore, for each bit position $i$, the stored bit $S_{i}$ is related to the programmer input bit $I_{i}$ by\n$$\nS_{i}=\\neg I_{i}.\n$$\nTo store the character 'K', the desired stored byte is $S=0x4B$, whose 8-bit binary form is\n$$\nS = 0100\\,1011.\n$$\nThus the required programmer input is the bitwise complement over 8 bits:\n$$\nI = \\neg S = 1011\\,0100 = 0xB4.\n$$\nTherefore, the 8-bit value to supply on D7–D0 is $B4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B4}$$", "id": "1932883"}, {"introduction": "EPROMs are not just for storing static firmware; they are also powerful tools for implementing complex combinational logic. This practice demonstrates how to use an EPROM as a lookup table (LUT) to create a custom digital circuit—in this case, a barrel shifter.
