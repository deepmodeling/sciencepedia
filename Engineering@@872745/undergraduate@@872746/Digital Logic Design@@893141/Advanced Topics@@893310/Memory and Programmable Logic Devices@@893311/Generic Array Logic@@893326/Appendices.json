This practice challenges you to implement a small Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) while respecting a key architectural feature of GALs: the two-level logic structure with no direct feedback between Output Logic Macrocells (OLMCs). You will need to derive logic equations for each output bit exclusively from the primary inputs, forcing you to \"flatten\" intermediate signals like internal carries, a crucial technique for efficient PLD implementation [@problem_id:1939736].", "problem": "You are tasked with designing a compact 2-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using a single Generic Array Logic (GAL) device. The ALU operates on two 2-bit unsigned binary numbers, $A = A_1A_0$ and $B = B_1B_0$, and is controlled by a 1-bit mode select input, $S$. The unit produces a 2-bit result $Z = Z_1Z_0$ and a 1-bit final carry-out, $C_{out}$.\n\nThe functionality of the ALU is defined as follows:\n- If $S=0$, the unit performs 2-bit addition: $\\{C_{out}, Z_1Z_0\\} = A + B$. Assume the initial carry-in to the 2-bit adder is 0.\n- If $S=1$, the unit performs a logical shift left on operand A: $Z_1 = A_0$ and $Z_0 = 0$. For this operation, the input $B$ is a \"don't care\", and the carry-out $C_{out}$ must be 0.\n\nThe target GAL device has a programmable AND array followed by a fixed OR array. Each output ($Z_1, Z_0, C_{out}$) is produced by its own dedicated combinational Output Logic Macrocell (OLMC), which is effectively a single large OR gate fed by product terms from the AND array. A critical constraint of this architecture is that there are no direct feedback paths between OLMCs within the logic array. Consequently, any intermediate signals, such as the carry from bit 0 to bit 1 during addition, cannot be generated in one OLMC and used by another. All logic for each output pin must be expressed solely in terms of the primary inputs: $A_1, A_0, B_1, B_0$, and $S$.\n\nYour task is to derive the minimal Sum-of-Products (SOP) logic equation for the most significant result bit, $Z_1$. Use standard Boolean notation where addition `+` denotes the OR operation, concatenation denotes the AND operation (e.g., $XY$ is $X$ AND $Y$), and an overbar denotes the NOT operation (e.g., $\\overline{X}$ is NOT $X$).", "solution": "We must express $Z_{1}$ solely in terms of the primary inputs $A_{1}, A_{0}, B_{1}, B_{0}$, and $S$, because the GAL architecture disallows inter-OLMC feedback.
