You will translate a standard Boolean logic expression into the specific 16-bit binary string that must be stored in a 4-input LUT's memory to implement it. This exercise solidifies the concept that a LUT is essentially a physical implementation of a function's truth table [@problem_id:1944846].", "problem": "In modern digital systems, many logic functions are implemented using programmable hardware elements. One such fundamental element is a Look-Up Table (LUT). A $k$-input LUT is a small memory that can implement any Boolean function of $k$ variables. It has $k$ address lines (the inputs to the function) and one data output. The memory stores $2^k$ bits, and for any given combination of inputs, the corresponding memory address is accessed and the bit stored at that location is presented at the output.\n\nConsider a 4-input LUT used to implement a specific Boolean function $f(A, B, C, D)$. The four inputs $A, B, C, D$ are used to form a 4-bit memory address, where $D$ is the Most Significant Bit (MSB) and $A$ is the Least Significant Bit (LSB). Thus, the address corresponds to the integer value of the binary number $DCBA$. The function to be implemented is given by the following expression:\n\n$$f(A, B, C, D) = (A \\oplus B) \\cdot (C + D)$$\n\nHere, $\\oplus$ denotes the logical XOR operation, $\\cdot$ denotes the logical AND operation, and $+$ denotes the logical OR operation.\n\nDetermine the 16-bit binary string that must be stored in the LUT's memory to realize this function. The string should be ordered corresponding to the contents of memory addresses 0 through 15.", "solution": "A $4$-input LUT uses inputs $A,B,C,D$ to form the address with $D$ as MSB and $A$ as LSB, so the address is the integer value of $DCBA$, which can be written as $n=8D+4C+2B+A$. The implemented function is\n$$\nf(A,B,C,D)=(A\\oplus B)\\cdot(C+D).\n$$\nWe evaluate $f$ for addresses $0$ through $15$.\n\n- When $C=D=0$ (addresses with $DCBA=00xx$, i.e., $n=0,1,2,3$), the term $C+D=0$, which makes the entire function $f=(A\\oplus B)\\cdot 0=0$. Thus, the bits at addresses $0,1,2,3$ are all $0$.\n\n- When $(C,D)$ is not $(0,0)$ (all remaining addresses), the term $C+D=1$, which simplifies the function to $f=A\\oplus B$. For each fixed pair of higher-order bits $(D,C)$, as the address increments through four values, the lower-order bits $(B,A)$ cycle through the four combinations: $(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)$. The corresponding values for the term $A \\oplus B$ are $0\\oplus0=0$, $1\\oplus0=1$, $0\\oplus1=1$, and $1\\oplus1=0$. This yields the output pattern $0,1,1,0$ for each of these 4-address blocks.\n\nApplying this logic to each block:\n1) $D=0,C=1$ (addresses $4,5,6,7$): outputs are $0,1,1,0$.\n2) $D=1,C=0$ (addresses $8,9,10,11$): outputs are $0,1,1,0$.\n3) $D=1,C=1$ (addresses $12,13,14,15$): outputs are $0,1,1,0$.\n\nCollecting all bits in order from address $0$ to $15$ gives the $16$-bit string:\n$$\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0.\n$$\nConcatenating these bits, the required LUT contents are:\n$$\n0000011001100110.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0000011001100110}$$", "id": "1944846"}, {"introduction": "Now that you have experience translating a logic function into a LUT's memory content, this exercise challenges you to do the reverse.
