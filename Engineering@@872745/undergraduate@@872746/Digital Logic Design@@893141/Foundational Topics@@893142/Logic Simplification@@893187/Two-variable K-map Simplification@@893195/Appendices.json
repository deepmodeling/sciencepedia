Your task is to determine the most simplified Sum-of-Products (SOP) Boolean expression for the alarm output F(A, B) using a Karnaugh Map (K-map).\n\nThe function F(A, B) is defined by the condition that its output is '1' for all four possible input combinations: (A=0, B=0), (A=0, B=1), (A=1, B=0), and (A=1, B=1).\n\nBased on the simplification of the corresponding two-variable K-map, which of the following expressions represents the function F?\n\nA. $1$\n\nB. $0$\n\nC. $A + B$\n\nD. $AB$\n\nE. $A \\oplus B$", "solution": "The goal is to find the simplified Boolean expression for a function F(A, B) that is always '1'. We will use a Karnaugh Map (K-map) for this purpose.\n\nFirst, we establish the truth table for the function F(A, B) based on the problem description. The problem states that the alarm F is active ('1') for all possible sensor states.\n\n| A | B | F(A, B) |\n|---|---|---------|\n| 0 | 0 | 1       |\n| 0 | 1 | 1       |\n| 1 | 0 | 1       |\n| 1 | 1 | 1       |\n\nNext, we map this truth table onto a two-variable K-map. The K-map is a grid where each cell corresponds to a minterm (a specific combination of inputs). For a two-variable function F(A, B), the K-map has $2^2 = 4$ cells.\n\nThe K-map is structured as follows, with the values of F(A, B) placed in the corresponding cells:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n\\text{A} \\backslash \\text{B} & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\n\\hline\n0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe next step in K-map simplification is to group adjacent cells that contain a '1'. The groups must be rectangular and contain a number of cells that is a power of two (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, ...). We aim to create the largest possible groups to cover all the '1's.\n\nIn this K-map, all four cells contain a '1'. Therefore, we can form a single group that covers all four cells. This is a $2 \\times 2$ group, which contains $4 = 2^2$ cells.\n\nThe final step is to determine the Boolean expression for this group. To do this, we identify which input variables remain constant throughout the group. Any variable that changes its value (from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0) within the group is eliminated from the term.\n\nLet's examine the variables A and B for our group of four:\n- **Variable A**: The group spans the row where A=0 and the row where A=1. Since A takes on both '0' and '1' within the group, it is not constant and is therefore eliminated.\n- **Variable B**: The group spans the column where B=0 and the column where B=1. Since B takes on both '0' and '1' within the group, it is also not constant and is therefore eliminated.\n\nSince both input variables, A and B, are eliminated, the expression for this group is not dependent on any input variable. When all variables are eliminated from a term that covers all the '1's in the function, the simplified expression is the Boolean constant '1'.\n\nThus, the simplified Boolean expression for the function F(A, B) is $1$.\n\nComparing our result with the given choices:\nA. $1$\nB. $0$\nC. $A + B$\nD. $AB$\nE. $A \\oplus B$\n\nThe correct option is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1974385"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basics, this next exercise challenges you to apply the rules of adjacency correctly by identifying and correcting a common error.

In this map, the cells for minterms $m_0$, $m_1$, and $m_3$ are correctly filled with '1's, while the remaining cell for $m_2$ is filled with a '0'.\n\nIn the simplification process, the designer makes a critical error. The designer attempts to cover the '1's by creating groups. One group correctly combines two horizontally adjacent '1's. However, the designer also forms a second group containing the two diagonally opposite '1's, corresponding to minterms $m_0$ (at row 0, column 0) and $m_3$ (at row 1, column 1). This diagonal grouping is invalid as K-map groups must consist of cells that are physically adjacent (horizontally or vertically), including wrap-around adjacency which is not applicable here.\n\nYour task is to ignore the flawed methodology and determine the correct minimal Sum-of-Products (SOP) expression for the function $F(A,B)$.

A '1' can be included in multiple groups if it helps to create a larger group. The invalid diagonal grouping mentioned in the problem is correctly ignored.\n\nWe identify the optimal groupings to cover all three '1's:\n\n**Group 1:**\nWe can group the two adjacent '1's in the top row. These correspond to minterms $m_0$ and $m_1$.\nThe cells are for $A'B'$ and $A'B$.\nIn this group, the variable $A$ is constant at $0$ (represented as $A'$), while the variable $B$ changes from $0$ to $1$. When a variable changes within a group, it is eliminated.\nThus, this group simplifies to the term $A'$.\n\n**Group 2:**\nAfter forming the first group, the '1' at position $m_3$ is still uncovered. To cover this '1', we should form the largest possible group that includes it. The '1' at $m_3$ is adjacent to the '1' at $m_1$ (vertically). We can therefore form a group of two with $m_1$ and $m_3$.\nThe cells are for $A'B$ and $AB$.\nIn this group, the variable $B$ is constant at $1$ (represented as $B$), while the variable $A$ changes from $0$ to $1$. The changing variable $A$ is eliminated.\nThus, this group simplifies to the term $B$.\n\nNote that the minterm $m_1$ is used in both groups. This is a valid and essential technique in K-map simplification, known as overlapping groups, which leads to the minimal expression.\n\n**Final Expression:**\nThe minimal SOP expression is the logical OR (sum) of the terms found from each group.\n$$F(A,B) = (\\text{Term from Group 1}) + (\\text{Term from Group 2})$$\n$$F(A,B) = A' + B$$\n\nThis is the simplest possible SOP expression for the given function. We can verify this algebraically using the original expression and Boolean laws:\n$F(A,B) = A'B' + A'B + AB$\nFirst, factor out $A'$ from the first two terms:\n$F(A,B) = A'(B' + B) + AB$\nUsing the identity $X + X' = 1$, we get $B' + B = 1$:\n$F(A,B) = A'(1) + AB = A' + AB$\nNow, we can apply the absorption identity $X' + XY = X' + Y$.
