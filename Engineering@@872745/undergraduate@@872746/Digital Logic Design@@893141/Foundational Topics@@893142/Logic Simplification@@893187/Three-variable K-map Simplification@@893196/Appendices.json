The sensors output a logic `1` for a high reading and a logic `0` for a low reading. The system is designed to trigger an alarm `F` (where `F=1` signifies an alarm) if and only if the temperature is high. The state of the other two sensors, pressure and concentration, does not affect the alarm's status when the temperature is high. If the temperature is low, the alarm is never triggered, regardless of the other sensor readings.\n\nThe logic function for the alarm is `F(X, Y, Z)`, where `X` corresponds to the most significant bit (MSB) and `Z` to the least significant bit (LSB) when representing the sensor states as a 3-bit binary number.\n\nUsing a Karnaugh map, determine the minimal sum-of-products (SOP) expression for the alarm function `F(X, Y, Z)`.", "solution": "Let $X$ (pressure), $Y$ (temperature), and $Z$ (concentration) be binary inputs. The alarm $F$ is specified to be $1$ if and only if the temperature is high, i.e., $Y=1$. The other inputs do not matter when $Y=1$, and when $Y=0$ the alarm is never triggered.
