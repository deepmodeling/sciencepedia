This exercise delves into BCD subtraction using the 9's complement method, a clever technique that transforms subtraction into an addition problem.

Consider a calculator that performs subtraction, such as $A - B$, using the 9's complement addition method. This process involves the following steps:\n1.  Find the 9's complement of the subtrahend, $B$. For a multi-digit number, the 9's complement is found by subtracting each individual digit from 9. Both $A$ and the 9's complement of $B$ must have the same number of digits, padding with leading zeros if necessary.\n2.  Add the BCD representation of $A$ to the BCD representation of the 9's complement of $B$.\n3.  During this BCD addition, if the sum of any 4-bit group exceeds 9 (i.e., is an invalid BCD code) or produces a carry-out, a correction is made by adding 6 (binary `$0110_2$`) to that 4-bit group. The carry from this correction is added to the next higher-order group.\n\nUsing this precise methodology, you are tasked to evaluate the subtraction of the decimal number $35_{10}$ from $62_{10}$.

A BCD adder's key component is the logic that determines when a correction is necessary. This practice [@problem_id:1913589] asks you to derive the precise Boolean expression for this correction signal, moving from the abstract rules of BCD addition to the concrete logic gates required to build a functional arithmetic circuit.", "problem": "In the design of an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), a common task is to create a circuit that can add numbers represented in Binary Coded Decimal (BCD). In BCD, each decimal digit from 0 to 9 is represented by its own 4-bit binary equivalent.\n\nConsider a 1-digit BCD adder that takes two 4-bit BCD inputs, $A = A_3A_2A_1A_0$ and $B = B_3B_2B_1B_0$. The first stage of this adder is a standard 4-bit binary adder that computes the sum $S = S_3S_2S_1S_0$ and a carry-out bit $C_{out}$. The 5-bit result $C_{out}S_3S_2S_1S_0$ represents the binary sum of the two input numbers.\n\nThis binary sum is not always a valid BCD representation. A correction is needed if the sum is greater than 9. This correction consists of adding the binary value for 6 ($0110_2$) to the sum $S$. To implement this, a combinational logic circuit is required to produce a \"correction needed\" signal, $K$, which is high ($K=1$) when the correction must be applied.\n\nThe condition for the correction to be necessary is that the decimal value of the sum is greater than 9. This occurs if either the 4-bit sum $S$ is a binary number from 10 to 15, or if the initial binary addition generated a carry-out ($C_{out}=1$), which corresponds to sums from 16 to 18.\n\nDerive the minimal Sum-of-Products (SOP) Boolean expression for the correction signal $K$ in terms of the sum bits ($S_3, S_2, S_1$) and the carry-out ($C_{out}$). You may find that not all sum bits are necessary for the minimal expression.", "solution": "We define the correction signal $K$ to be $1$ exactly when the 5-bit binary sum represents a decimal value greater than $9$. This happens in two disjoint cases:\n1) The 4-bit binary adder produces a carry-out, i.e., $C_{out}=1$. Then the sum is at least $16$, and a BCD correction is required.\n2) There is no carry-out, i.e., $C_{out}=0$, but the 4-bit sum $S_{3}S_{2}S_{1}S_{0}$ is a value from $10$ to $15$.\n\nWe can combine these conditions into a single Boolean expression. The correction signal $K$ is true if $C_{out}$ is true OR the sum $S$ is greater than 9.\nThe condition \"S is greater than 9\" for a 4-bit number $S_3S_2S_1S_0$ can be represented with Boolean logic. The sums from 10 to 15 are:\n- $10 = 1010_2$\n- $11 = 1011_2$\n- $12 = 1100_2$\n- $13 = 1101_2$\n- $14 = 1110_2$\n- $15 = 1111_2$\n\nAll these numbers have $S_3=1$. For the numbers 12-15, $S_2$ is also 1. This condition is $S_3 S_2$. For the numbers 10 and 11, $S_3=1$, $S_2=0$, and $S_1=1$. This condition is $S_3 \\overline{S_2} S_1$. Using a Karnaugh map, these simplify. The values 10 ($1010$), 11 ($1011$), 14 ($1110$), and 15 ($1111$) can be grouped by the term $S_3S_1$. The values 12 ($1100$), 13 ($1101$), 14 ($1110$), and 15 ($1111$) can be grouped by the term $S_3S_2$. Therefore, the condition $S>9$ is equivalent to $S_3S_2 + S_3S_1$.\n\nCombining this with the carry-out condition, the full expression for the correction signal $K$ is:\n$$\nK = C_{out} + S_{3}S_{2} + S_{3}S_{1}\n$$\nThis is the minimal Sum-of-Products expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C_{out}+S_{3}S_{2}+S_{3}S_{1}}$$", "id": "1913589"}]}
