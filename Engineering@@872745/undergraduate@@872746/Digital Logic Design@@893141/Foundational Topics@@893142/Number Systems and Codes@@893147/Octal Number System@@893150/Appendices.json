Since $8 = 2^3$, each octal digit conveniently corresponds to a unique group of three binary digits (bits), making it an excellent shorthand for long binary sequences. This exercise [@problem_id:1949113] will guide you through this fundamental conversion process, a crucial skill for interpreting data in many digital systems and legacy computer architectures.", "problem": "In many computer systems, particularly those with architectures influenced by legacy hardware like the PDP-8, the octal number system is used as a compact representation of binary data. An engineer is analyzing a data packet from such a system. The packet's checksum value is recorded as the octal number $(705)_8$. To perform a validation check, the engineer needs to convert this checksum into its equivalent 9-bit binary representation.\n\nWhich of the following options represents the correct 9-bit binary equivalent of the octal number $(705)_8$?\n\nA. $110000101$\n\nB. $111000110$\n\nC. $101000111$\n\nD. $111000101$\n\nE. $011100010$", "solution": "An octal digit maps to exactly three binary bits because $8=2^{3}$. To convert $(705)_{8}$ to binary, convert each octal digit to its three-bit binary equivalent:\n- $7=2^{2}+2^{1}+2^{0}\\Rightarrow 111$\n- $0\\Rightarrow 000$\n- $5=2^{2}+2^{0}\\Rightarrow 101$\n\nConcatenating these groups yields the 9-bit binary number $111000101$.\n\nVerification by decimal conversion:\n$$(705)_{8}=7\\cdot 8^{2}+0\\cdot 8^{1}+5\\cdot 8^{0}=7\\cdot 64+5=448+5=453,$$\nand\n$$453=2^{8}+2^{7}+2^{6}+2^{2}+2^{0}\\Rightarrow 111000101_2,$$\nwhich matches the result above.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1949113"}, {"introduction": "Beyond converting between bases, it's essential to develop an intuition for the magnitude of octal numbers.

By the positional numeral system principle, the value in base 10 of the two-digit octal number $d_{1}d_{0}$ is\n$$\nV = d_{1}\\cdot 8^{1} + d_{0}\\cdot 8^{0}.\n$$\nTo maximize $V$, choose the largest allowed digits: $d_{1} = 7$ and $d_{0} = 7$. Substituting gives\n$$\nV_{\\max} = 7\\cdot 8^{1} + 7\\cdot 8^{0} = 7\\cdot 8 + 7\\cdot 1 = 56 + 7 = 63.\n$$\nThus, the maximum possible decimal value is $63$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{63}$$", "id": "1949120"}, {"introduction": "A number system is only truly useful if we can perform arithmetic within it.

Borrow $1$ from the eights place; in base $8$, this adds $8$ to the units digit. Thus the units computation becomes $6 + 8 - 7 = 7$, and the eights digit $7$ reduces to $6$.\n\nNow compute the eights digit: $6 - 4 = 2$.\n\nTherefore, $(76)_{8} - (47)_{8} = (27)_{8}$, so the displacement in octal is $27$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{27}$$", "id": "1949103"}]}
