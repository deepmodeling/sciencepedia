The system's logic is based on two input signals, $A$ and $B$. Signal $A$ is true (logic 1) when the primary reactant tank level is adequate and false (logic 0) otherwise. Signal $B$ is true when a secondary catalyst is present and false when it is not.\n\nThe initial design specification for the motor activation logic is as follows: The motor $M$ should activate if (the primary tank level is adequate OR the catalyst is present) AND (the primary tank level is adequate OR the catalyst is not present).\n\nLet the Boolean variable $A$ represent the state of the primary tank level and $B$ represent the presence of the catalyst.
