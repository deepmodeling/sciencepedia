The required function is the logical OR of these four flags. The initial blueprint of the circuit, derived from a sequential requirement analysis, specifies the logic using the Boolean expression $F = W + (X + (Y + Z))$, where `+` denotes the OR operation.\n\nFor implementation, only 2-input OR gates are available. Each of these gates has an identical and non-zero propagation delay, denoted as $t_p$.

The propagation delay from an input to the output along any path equals the number of cascaded gates on that path multiplied by $t_{p}$, since all gates have equal, non-zero delay and interconnect delays are not specified.\n\nTo realize the OR of four inputs using only 2-input gates, the total number of gates required is $4 - 1 = 3$, because each 2-input OR gate reduces the number of distinct signals by one. However, the critical performance metric is the logic depth (number of gate levels) on the longest input-to-output path.

This corresponds to a serial chain: first compute $(Y + Z)$ (one gate), then $(X + (Y + Z))$ (second gate), then $W + \\text{previous}$ (third gate).
