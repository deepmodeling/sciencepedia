This practice moves from abstract logic to a common engineering scenario: constructing a larger 4-input AND gate from a limited supply of 2-input gates.

[@problem_id:1966756]", "problem": "A digital systems engineer is designing a small control unit for an embedded system. A specific part of the logic requires a 4-input AND function, which computes the expression $Y = A \\cdot B \\cdot C \\cdot D$, where the variables represent the four input signals and the $\\cdot$ symbol denotes the logical AND operation.\n\nDue to manufacturing constraints, the engineer's component library is limited to standard 2-input AND gates. Each of these 2-input gates has an identical, non-zero propagation delay, denoted by $\\tau$. The propagation delay is the time it takes for a change in an input signal to result in a stable and correct change at the gate's output.

The design must minimize the number of gates, and among those, minimize the worst-case propagation delay.\n\nFirst, we derive the minimum number of 2-input gates required. A 2-input AND gate combines two signals into one. Starting from the four independent inputs $\\{A,B,C,D\\}$, each gate can reduce the count of separate signals by at most one. If $g$ gates are used, the minimum possible number of remaining signals is $4 - g$. To obtain a single output, we require\n$$\n4 - g = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad g = 3.\n$$\nEquivalently, implementing an $n$-input AND with only 2-input gates realizes a binary tree with $n$ leaves, which requires $n - 1$ internal nodes (gates). For $n=4$, this gives $4 - 1 = 3$ gates. Hence, $3$ gates is a tight lower bound and is achievable.\n\nNext, we minimize the worst-case propagation delay. With per-gate delay $\\tau$ and negligible wire delay, the total delay along a path equals the number of gate stages on that path times $\\tau$.

This final practice introduces you to the crucial field of digital verification, using the standard 'stuck-at' fault model to simulate common hardware defects. Your goal is to develop a minimal set of test inputs, or 'vectors,' to efficiently confirm that a 3-input AND gate is functioning exactly as intended. [@problem_id:1966706]", "problem": "In the quality assurance department of an integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing facility, you are tasked with creating an efficient testing procedure for a batch of 3-input AND gates. The gate has three inputs, denoted as A, B, and C, and a single output, F. The testing must conform to the single stuck-at fault model. This model assumes that a fault in the circuit will manifest as a single line (either an input or an output terminal) being permanently \"stuck\" at a logic 0 (stuck-at-0, or SA0) or a logic 1 (stuck-at-1, or SA1).\n\nA test vector is a specific combination of logic values applied to the inputs (A, B, C). A fault is considered \"detected\" by a test vector if the output F of the faulty gate is different from the output of a fault-free gate for that same test vector.

For propagation through an AND gate, the other inputs must be at the non-controlling value $1$ so the output depends on $A$. Hence the required vector is $(1,1,1)$. By symmetry, $(1,1,1)$ detects $A$ SA0, $B$ SA0, and $C$ SA0 simultaneously. For the output fault $F$ SA0, detection requires the good output to be $1$ so that the faulty output $0$ differs; the only such input is again $(1,1,1)$. Therefore $(1,1,1)$ covers all SA0 faults on $A$, $B$, $C$, and $F$.\n\n- Input SA1 faults:\n  For $A$ SA1, excitation requires $A=0$ while propagation requires the other inputs be $1$, yielding $(0,1,1)$. Similarly, $B$ SA1 is detected by $(1,0,1)$ and $C$ SA1 by $(1,1,0)$. No single vector can detect more than one input SA1 fault, because to detect (for example) $A$ SA1 the other inputs must be $1$ while $A=0$, whereas to detect $B$ SA1 in the same vector would simultaneously require $B=0$ with the others $1$, which is impossible. Hence at least three distinct vectors are required to cover the three input SA1 faults.\n\n- Output SA1 fault:\n  For $F$ SA1, the faulty output is always $1$, so any input that yields a good output $0$ will detect it. Each of $(0,1,1)$, $(1,0,1)$, and $(1,1,0)$ produces $F=0$ in the good circuit and therefore detects $F$ SA1. Thus no additional vector beyond these is needed for $F$ SA1.\n\nCombining the above, a minimal test set must contain at least the three vectors $(0,1,1)$, $(1,0,1)$, $(1,1,0)$ for the input SA1 faults and the vector $(1,1,1)$ for all SA0 faults. This yields the set $V = \\{(0,1,1), (1,0,1), (1,1,0), (1,1,1)\\}$.\n\nAmong the options, this is exactly option A.
