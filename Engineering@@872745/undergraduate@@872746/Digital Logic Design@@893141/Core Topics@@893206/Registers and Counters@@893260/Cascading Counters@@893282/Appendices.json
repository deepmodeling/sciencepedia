[@problem_id:1919479]", "problem": "In a digital electronics laboratory, a student is tasked with designing a precision event timer. The design uses a stable Quartz Crystal Oscillator (QCO) with a frequency of $f_{osc}$ as its time base, and several identical 4-bit synchronous binary counter Integrated Circuits (ICs) are cascaded together to count the clock pulses. The timer is designed to measure time intervals up to a maximum duration of $T_{max}$ without overflowing. An overflow occurs if the total number of clock pulses counted exceeds the maximum value that the cascaded counter system can store.\n\nGiven the QCO frequency is $f_{osc} = 10.0 \\text{ MHz}$ and the maximum time interval to be measured is $T_{max} = 1.00 \\text{ ms}$, calculate the minimum integer number of 4-bit counter ICs that must be cascaded to construct a timer that meets this requirement.", "solution": "The number of clock pulses counted during the maximum interval is given by the time-base relation $N = f_{osc} T_{max}$.

In this configuration, the rollover of one counter triggers the next, creating a chain reaction. This problem challenges you to trace the state of an asynchronous cascaded system, reinforcing your understanding of how modulo arithmetic governs the behavior of individual counters and the system as a whole. [@problem_id:1919471]", "problem": "A digital timing circuit is constructed by cascading two binary up-counters, Counter A and Counter B. Counter A is a MOD-4 counter with two output lines, $Q_{A1}Q_{A0}$, where $Q_{A1}$ is the most significant bit. Counter B is a MOD-8 counter with three output lines, $Q_{B2}Q_{B1}Q_{B0}$, where $Q_{B2}$ is the most significant bit.\n\nThe system is configured as a ripple counter: a primary clock signal is connected to the input of Counter A. Counter B is clocked by the falling edge of the most significant bit output of Counter A, which is $Q_{A1}$.\n\nAt the start of the operation ($t=0$), a global reset signal is applied, setting the initial state of both counters to 0.

The system consists of a MOD-4 counter (Counter A) whose output clocks a MOD-8 counter (Counter B). We need to determine the final state of each counter individually and then combine them.\n\nFirst, let's analyze Counter A. It is a MOD-4 counter, which means it cycles through four states (0, 1, 2, 3) and then repeats. Its state after receiving $N$ clock pulses from the primary clock is given by the remainder of the division of $N$ by 4.\nThe state of Counter A, $S_A$, is calculated as:\n$$S_A = N \\pmod{4}$$\nGiven that $N=40$ pulses have been applied:\n$$S_A = 40 \\pmod{4} = 0$$\nSo, the final state of Counter A is 0. In a 2-bit binary representation ($Q_{A1}Q_{A0}$), this state is `00`.\n\nNext, we analyze Counter B. It is a MOD-8 counter, but it is not clocked by the primary clock. Instead, it is clocked by the falling edge of the most significant bit ($Q_{A1}$) of Counter A. For a 2-bit binary up-counter (MOD-4), the states are `00`, `01`, `10`, `11`. The most significant bit, $Q_{A1}$, follows the pattern `0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, ...`. A falling edge on $Q_{A1}$ occurs when it transitions from 1 back to 0. This happens precisely when Counter A goes from state `11` (decimal 3) back to state `00` (decimal 0). This event, known as a rollover, occurs once for every full cycle of Counter A.\nSince Counter A is a MOD-4 counter, it completes a full cycle every 4 pulses of the primary clock. Therefore, the number of clock pulses received by Counter B, let's call it $N_B$, is the total number of primary pulses $N$ divided by 4, taking the integer part of the result.\n$$N_B = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{N}{4} \\right\\rfloor$$\nSubstituting $N=40$:\n$$N_B = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{4} \\right\\rfloor = 10$$\nSo, Counter B receives 10 clock pulses.\n\nNow we can determine the final state of Counter B. It is a MOD-8 counter, so its state, $S_B$, after $N_B$ pulses is:\n$$S_B = N_B \\pmod{8}$$\nWith $N_B=10$:\n$$S_B = 10 \\pmod{8} = 2$$\nThe final state of Counter B is 2. In a 3-bit binary representation ($Q_{B2}Q_{B1}Q_{B0}$), this state is `010`.\n\nFinally, we combine the states of the two counters to get the overall system state. The problem specifies the format $Q_{B2}Q_{B1}Q_{B0}Q_{A1}Q_{A0}$.\nWe concatenate the binary representation of $S_B$ with the binary representation of $S_A$.\nState of Counter B ($S_B=2$): `010`\nState of Counter A ($S_A=0$): `00`\nCombined state = $Q_{B2}Q_{B1}Q_{B0}Q_{A1}Q_{A0}$ = `01000`.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider the total modulus of the system, which is the product of the individual moduli: $M_{total} = 4 \\times 8 = 32$. The system behaves as a MOD-32 counter. The overall count after 40 pulses is $40 \\pmod{32} = 8$. The 5-bit binary representation of the decimal number 8 is indeed `01000`, which confirms our result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{01000}$$", "id": "1919471"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply extending the count range, cascading techniques allow for the synthesis of counters with custom moduli, which is essential for tasks like frequency division and state machine control.

You are allowed to use any configuration of these counters in a cascade, parallel, or mixed topology, interconnected with any required combinatorial logic gates (e.g., AND, OR, NOT) to control their clock or enable inputs.

Let the least significant counter $x$ be enabled every clock (so it counts modulo $5$ on each input clock). Enable the counter $y$ if and only if $x=4$ at that clock, and enable the counter $z$ if and only if $x=4$ and $y=4$ at that clock. These enables are realizable by equality-detection combinational logic.
