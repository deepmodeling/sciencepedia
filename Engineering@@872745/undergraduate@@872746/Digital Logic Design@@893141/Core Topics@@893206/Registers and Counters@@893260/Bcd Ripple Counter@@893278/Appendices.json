The counter is preset to the decimal number 4. In a 4-bit binary representation ($Q_D Q_C Q_B Q_A$), this corresponds to:\nInitial State: $Q_D Q_C Q_B Q_A = 0100$.\n\nThe counter is an asynchronous (ripple) counter built with negative edge-triggered J-K flip-flops. Since the J and K inputs are tied high ($J=1, K=1$), each flip-flop is configured to toggle its state upon receiving a negative edge at its clock input.\n\nIn a ripple counter, the external clock is applied only to the first flip-flop (for the LSB $Q_A$). The clock input for each subsequent flip-flop is driven by the output of the preceding flip-flop. This means the flip-flop for $Q_B$ is clocked by $Q_A$, the flip-flop for $Q_C$ is clocked by $Q_B$, and the flip-flop for $Q_D$ is clocked by $Q_C$. Since the flip-flops are negative edge-triggered, a flip-flop toggles only when its clock input transitions from a high state (1) to a low state (0).\n\nLet's trace the state of the counter for each of the 3 clock pulses.\n\n**Initial State:** $Q_D=0, Q_C=1, Q_B=0, Q_A=0$.\n\n**After the 1st clock pulse:**\n1.  The external clock applies a negative edge to the first flip-flop.\n2.  $Q_A$ toggles from its current state of 0 to 1.\n3.  The output $Q_A$ transitions from 0 to 1. This is a rising edge, not a falling (negative) edge. Therefore, it does not trigger the flip-flop for $Q_B$.\n4.  Since the flip-flop for $Q_B$ does not toggle, $Q_B$ remains 0. Consequently, the flip-flop for $Q_C$ is not triggered, and $Q_C$ remains 1. Similarly, the flip-flop for $Q_D$ is not triggered, and $Q_D$ remains 0.\n5.  The new state of the counter is $Q_D Q_C Q_B Q_A = 0101$. This corresponds to decimal 5.\n\n**After the 2nd clock pulse:**\n1.  The external clock applies another negative edge to the first flip-flop.\n2.  $Q_A$ toggles from its current state of 1 to 0.\n3.  The output $Q_A$ transitions from 1 to 0. This is a falling (negative) edge, which serves as the clock signal for the flip-flop for $Q_B$.\n4.  The flip-flop for $Q_B$ receives a negative edge from $Q_A$ and toggles. $Q_B$ changes from 0 to 1.\n5.  The output $Q_B$ transitions from 0 to 1. This is a rising edge, so it does not trigger the flip-flop for $Q_C$. $Q_C$ remains 1.\n6.  Since $Q_C$ did not change, the flip-flop for $Q_D$ is not triggered. $Q_D$ remains 0.\n7.  The new state of the counter is $Q_D Q_C Q_B Q_A = 0110$. This corresponds to decimal 6.\n\n**After the 3rd clock pulse:**\n1.  The external clock applies a third negative edge to the first flip-flop.\n2.  $Q_A$ toggles from its current state of 0 to 1.\n3.  The output $Q_A$ transitions from 0 to 1. This is a rising edge, so it does not trigger the flip-flop for $Q_B$.\n4.  Since the flip-flop for $Q_B$ does not toggle, $Q_B$ remains 1. Consequently, the flip-flop for $Q_C$ is not triggered, and $Q_C$ remains 1. Similarly, the flip-flop for $Q_D$ is not triggered, and $Q_D$ remains 0.\n5.  The new state of the counter is $Q_D Q_C Q_B Q_A = 0111$. This corresponds to decimal 7.\n\nThe counting sequence is 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7. The BCD property, which involves resetting from a count greater than 9, is not activated in this range.

Consequently, no stable state with $Q_{D}=1$ can persist. The counter can only exhibit stable states with $Q_{D}=0$, i.e., exactly the binary states from $0000_{2}$ through $0111_{2}$.\n\nStarting from $0000_{2}$, the normal ripple progression is\n$$0000 \\to 0001 \\to 0010 \\to 0011 \\to 0100 \\to 0101 \\to 0110 \\to 0111.$$\nThe next normal state would be $1000$, which requires $Q_{D}$ to toggle to $1$ as $Q_{C}$ makes a $1 \\to 0$ transition.
