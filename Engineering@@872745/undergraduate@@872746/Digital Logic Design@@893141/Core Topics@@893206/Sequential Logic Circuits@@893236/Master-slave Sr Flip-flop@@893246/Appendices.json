In its typical configuration, the master latch is enabled by the clock signal, `CLK`, while the slave latch is enabled by the inverted clock signal, `~CLK`. The master latch receives the external `S` and `R` inputs, and its outputs (`Qm`, `~Qm`) are fed into the `S` and `R` inputs of the slave latch, respectively. The overall outputs of the flip-flop, `Q` and `~Q`, are the outputs of the slave latch. This configuration ensures that the flip-flop is edge-triggered.\n\nConsider a scenario where this flip-flop is modified due to a fault. The inverter that generates `~CLK` for the slave latch has failed and is now bypassed. As a result, the enable inputs of both the master latch and the slave latch are connected directly to the same `CLK` signal.\n\nHow does this modification alter the overall behavior of the circuit?\n\nA.

The circuit enters a state of oscillation or becomes metastable whenever `CLK` is high, regardless of the `S` and `R` inputs.", "solution": "Define the behavior of a gated SR latch with enable input $E$. Let $Q$ be the output and $Q^{+}$ its next value. The characteristic operation is:\n- If $E=0$, then $Q^{+}=Q$ (hold).\n- If $E=1$:\n  - If $(S,R)=(1,0)$, then $Q^{+}=1$ (set).\n  - If $(S,R)=(0,1)$, then $Q^{+}=0$ (reset).\n  - If $(S,R)=(0,0)$, then $Q^{+}=Q$ (hold).\n  - If $(S,R)=(1,1)$, the input is invalid.\n\nIn a standard master-slave SR flip-flop, the master latch enable is $E_{M}=\\text{CLK}$ and the slave latch enable is $E_{S}=\\overline{\\text{CLK}}$. Because $E_{M}$ and $E_{S}$ are complementary, the master can be transparent only when the slave is opaque and vice versa. Thus, while $\\text{CLK}=1$, the master follows $(S,R)$ and the slave holds; when $\\text{CLK}$ transitions to $0$, the master holds and the slave becomes transparent, copying the master’s stored state to $Q$. This nonoverlap yields edge-triggered behavior.\n\nWith the inverter bypassed, both enables are tied: $E_{M}=E_{S}=\\text{CLK}$. Analyze by cases:\n\n- If $\\text{CLK}=0$, then $E_{M}=E_{S}=0$, so both latches are opaque. The master holds its state $(Q_{m}^{+}=Q_{m})$ and the slave holds its state $(Q^{+}=Q)$. Hence the overall output $Q$ holds.\n\n- If $\\text{CLK}=1$, then $E_{M}=E_{S}=1$, so both latches are transparent. The master’s outputs $(Q_{m},\\overline{Q_{m}})$ respond immediately to $(S,R)$ according to the gated SR rules above. The slave’s inputs are $S_{S}=Q_{m}$ and $R_{S}=\\overline{Q_{m}}$, so with its enable also high, the slave output $Q$ follows $Q_{m}$ (subject only to propagation delay). Therefore, while $\\text{CLK}=1$, the overall $Q$ responds to $(S,R)$ exactly as a single gated SR latch would: set if $S=1,R=0$, reset if $S=0,R=1$, hold if $S=R=0$, and invalid if $S=R=1$.\n\nHence the composite loses edge-triggering and reduces to a single level-sensitive gated SR latch that is transparent when $\\text{CLK}=1$ and opaque when $\\text{CLK}=0$.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A matches the derived behavior.\n- B is false because transparency requires $\\text{CLK}=1$; when $\\text{CLK}=0$, $Q$ holds.\n- C is false; the circuit is not stuck and responds when enabled.\n- D is false; there is no edge-triggering without complementary enables.\n- E is false; with valid SR inputs the cascaded transparent latches are stable and do not inherently oscillate.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1946082"}]}
