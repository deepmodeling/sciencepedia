The data output (Q) of FF_A is connected to the data input (D) of FF_B through a block of combinational logic.\n\nThe timing characteristics of these components are given by the following symbolic parameters:\n- The clock-to-Q delay of FF_A is $t_{CQ}$. This is the time it takes for a change at the D input to appear at the Q output after a triggering clock edge.\n- The hold time of FF_B is $t_{H}$. This is the minimum amount of time the data at the D input must be held stable *after* the triggering clock edge for it to be latched correctly.\n- The minimum contamination delay (i.e., the shortest possible propagation time) through the combinational logic block is denoted by $t_{logic,min}$.\n\nThe clock signal is distributed across the chip and does not arrive at both flip-flops simultaneously. The clock edge arrives at the clock pin of FF_A at time $t_A$ and at the clock pin of FF_B at time $t_B$. The clock skew is defined as $t_{skew} = t_B - t_A$. A positive skew means the clock signal reaches the destination flip-flop FF_B later than the source flip-flop FF_A.\n\nTo ensure functionally correct operation by preventing a hold time violation at FF_B, the clock skew $t_{skew}$ must not exceed a certain maximum value.
