This is formally captured in an excitation table. Consider a standard Set-Reset (SR) flip-flop, where $Q(t)$ represents the present state and $Q(t+1)$ represents the next state after one clock pulse. The behavior of the SR flip-flop is governed by the following rules based on its inputs, S and R:\n- If S=0 and R=0, the flip-flop holds its current state, so $Q(t+1) = Q(t)$.\n- If S=0 and R=1, the flip-flop resets, so $Q(t+1) = 0$.\n- If S=1 and R=0, the flip-flop sets, so $Q(t+1) = 1$.\n- If S=1 and R=1, the input is considered forbidden or invalid, and the resulting state is unpredictable.\n\nFor a specific part of a circuit design, it is required that the flip-flop transitions from a present state of $Q(t)=1$ to a next state of $Q(t+1)=0$.
