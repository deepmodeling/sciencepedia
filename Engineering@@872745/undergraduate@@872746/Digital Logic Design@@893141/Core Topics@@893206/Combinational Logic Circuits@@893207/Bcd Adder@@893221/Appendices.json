The circuit produces a 4-bit BCD sum output, S, and a 1-bit carry-out, $C_{out}$.\n\nThe operation of the adder proceeds in two stages. In the first stage, a standard 4-bit binary addition is performed on the inputs A, B, and $C_{in}$. This yields a 4-bit preliminary sum, $S'$, and a 1-bit preliminary carry, $C'_{out}$. In the second stage, a correction is applied if the result is invalid in BCD. The condition for correction is met if the preliminary sum $S'$ is greater than 9 (i.e., $> 1001_2$), or if the preliminary carry $C'_{out}$ is 1. The final carry-out, $C_{out}$, is 1 if this correction condition is met, and 0 otherwise. If a correction is needed, the binary value for 6 ($0110_2$) is added to the preliminary sum $S'$ to produce the final 4-bit sum S.
