This can be solved by considering the structure of the cascaded MUXs level by level.\n\n**Level 1:**\nThe primary goal is to handle the 1024 initial data inputs. Since each available MUX is an 8-to-1 MUX, it can take 8 inputs and select one. To accommodate all 1024 inputs, we group them into sets of 8. The number of MUXs required for this first level is the total number of inputs divided by the number of inputs per MUX.\nNumber of MUXs in Level 1 = $\\frac{1024}{8} = 128$.\nThis first level of 128 MUXs produces 128 outputs, one from each MUX.\n\n**Level 2:**\nThe 128 outputs from Level 1 now become the inputs for the second level of the circuit. We need to select one of these 128 signals. Again, we use 8-to-1 MUXs. The number of MUXs required for this level is the number of inputs (128) divided by 8.\nNumber of MUXs in Level 2 = $\\frac{128}{8} = 16$.\nThis second level of 16 MUXs produces 16 outputs.\n\n**Level 3:**\nThe 16 outputs from Level 2 are the inputs for the third level. We need to select one of these 16 signals. The number of MUXs required is found by grouping these 16 inputs into sets of 8. Since 16 is not perfectly divisible by 8, we need to take the ceiling of the division.\nNumber of MUXs in Level 3 = $\\lceil \\frac{16}{8} \\rceil = \\lceil 2 \\rceil = 2$.\nThese two MUXs will produce 2 outputs. The first MUX will handle inputs 1 through 8, and the second MUX will handle inputs 9 through 16. The unused inputs on the second MUX are typically tied to a logic low or high value, but this doesn't change the number of MUX devices needed.\n\n**Level 4:**\nThe 2 outputs from Level 3 are the inputs for the final level of selection. We need to select one of these 2 signals to produce the final single output of the 1024-to-1 MUX. We must use an 8-to-1 MUX for this task, as it is the only component available.\nNumber of MUXs in Level 4 = $\\lceil \\frac{2}{8} \\rceil = \\lceil 0.25 \\rceil = 1$.\nThis final MUX will take the 2 inputs and produce the single final output.\n\n**Total Number of MUXs:**\nThe total number of 8-to-1 MUXs is the sum of the MUXs used in all levels.\nTotal MUXs = (MUXs in Level 1) + (MUXs in Level 2) + (MUXs in Level 3) + (MUXs in Level 4)\nTotal MUXs = $128 + 16 + 2 + 1 = 147$.\n\nTherefore, a total of 147 8-to-1 MUXs are required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{147}$$", "id": "1920031"}, {"introduction": "Once the physical structure of a cascaded multiplexer is determined, the next crucial step is to understand its control mechanism.
