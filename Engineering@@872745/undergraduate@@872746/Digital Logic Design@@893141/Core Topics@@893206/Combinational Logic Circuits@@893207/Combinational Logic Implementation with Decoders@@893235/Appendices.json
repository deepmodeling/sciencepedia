A BCD number uses a 4-bit binary code to represent the decimal digits from 0 to 9.

The output $F$ must be a logic HIGH (1) if the input represents an invalid BCD digit, and a logic LOW (0) otherwise.\n\nYou must implement this circuit using only the following two components:\n1.  A single 4-to-16 decoder with active-HIGH outputs. The decoder has four inputs ($A_3, A_2, A_1, A_0$) and sixteen outputs ($Y_0, Y_1, \\ldots, Y_{15}$).
