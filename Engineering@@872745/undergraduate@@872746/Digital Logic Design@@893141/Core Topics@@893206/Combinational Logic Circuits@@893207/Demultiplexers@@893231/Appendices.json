Mastering this is the first step toward effectively using DEMUXs in any digital system.", "problem": "A digital control system is designed to manage a linear array of eight special-purpose Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), indexed from $L_0$ to $L_7$. The system employs a single 1-to-8 demultiplexer (DEMUX) to achieve this control. A DEMUX is a digital circuit that routes a single input line to one of several output lines.\n\nThis specific DEMUX has one data input line, denoted as $D_{in}$, three select lines, $S_2, S_1, S_0$, and eight output lines, $Y_0$ through $Y_7$. Each output line $Y_i$ is connected to the corresponding LED $L_i$. An LED will illuminate if and only if its connected DEMUX output is at a logic '1' state; otherwise, it remains off (logic '0').\n\nThe functionality of the DEMUX is as follows: the three select lines $S_2, S_1, S_0$ are interpreted as a 3-bit binary number, where $S_2$ is the most significant bit (MSB) and $S_0$ is the least significant bit (LSB). If the decimal equivalent of the binary number $S_2S_1S_0$ is $k$, then the output line $Y_k$ is set to the logic level of the data input, $D_{in}$. All other output lines $Y_j$ (where $j \\neq k$) are maintained at a logic '0' state, regardless of the value of $D_{in}$.\n\nTo perform a specific diagnostic test, the control system must illuminate only the LED labeled $L_6$, ensuring all other seven LEDs remain off. To achieve this state, what must be the logic levels for the data input $D_{in}$ and the select lines $S_2, S_1, S_0$?\n\nA.   $D_{in}=1, S_2=1, S_1=1, S_0=0$\n\nB.   $D_{in}=1, S_2=1, S_1=0, S_0=1$\n\nC.   $D_{in}=0, S_2=1, S_1=1, S_0=0$\n\nD.   $D_{in}=1, S_2=0, S_1=1, S_0=1$\n\nE.   $D_{in}=0, S_2=0, S_1=1, S_0=1$", "solution": "The problem requires us to determine the state of the data input ($D_{in}$) and the three select lines ($S_2, S_1, S_0$) for a 1-to-8 demultiplexer (DEMUX) to make output $Y_6$ equal to logic '1' while all other outputs are logic '0'.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the condition for the outputs. To illuminate only LED $L_6$, we need the output line $Y_6$ to be at logic '1'. To keep all other LEDs off, we need all other output lines ($Y_0, Y_1, Y_2, Y_3, Y_4, Y_5, Y_7$) to be at logic '0'.\n\nThe DEMUX's operation is defined by its select lines. The select lines $S_2, S_1, S_0$ form a 3-bit binary number whose decimal value selects which output line will be connected to the data input $D_{in}$. All other outputs are automatically set to '0'.\n\nTo affect the output line $Y_6$, we must select it. This means the decimal value of the binary number formed by the select lines must be 6. We need to find the 3-bit binary representation of the decimal number 6.\n\nThe select lines are given with $S_2$ as the most significant bit (MSB) and $S_0$ as the least significant bit (LSB). The value is calculated as $S_2 \\times 2^2 + S_1 \\times 2^1 + S_0 \\times 2^0$.\nTo get a value of 6, we can express it in terms of powers of 2:\n$6 = 4 + 2 + 0 = 1 \\cdot 2^2 + 1 \\cdot 2^1 + 0 \\cdot 2^0$.\n\nComparing this with the weighted sum of the select lines, we can determine the required logic levels:\n$S_2 = 1$\n$S_1 = 1$\n$S_0 = 0$\n\nSo, the select lines must be set to $S_2S_1S_0 = 110$.\n\nWith these select line settings, the DEMUX ensures that output $Y_6$ is connected to the data input $D_{in}$, so $Y_6 = D_{in}$. It also ensures that all other outputs $Y_j$ (for $j \\neq 6$) are set to logic '0'. This satisfies the condition that all other LEDs are off.\n\nNow, we must satisfy the condition that LED $L_6$ is on. This requires $Y_6$ to be logic '1'. Since $Y_6 = D_{in}$ with our chosen select lines, we must set the data input to logic '1'.\nTherefore, $D_{in} = 1$.\n\nCombining these results, the required input configuration is:\n$D_{in}=1$, $S_2=1$, $S_1=1$, and $S_0=0$.\n\nWe now compare this result with the given multiple-choice options.\nA.   $D_{in}=1, S_2=1, S_1=1, S_0=0$\nB.   $D_{in}=1, S_2=1, S_1=0, S_0=1$ (selects $Y_5$)\nC.   $D_{in}=0, S_2=1, S_1=1, S_0=0$ (selects $Y_6$ but sets it to 0, so $L_6$ is off)\nD.   $D_{in}=1, S_2=0, S_1=1, S_0=1$ (selects $Y_3$)\nE.   $D_{in}=0, S_2=0, S_1=1, S_0=1$ (selects $Y_3$ but sets it to 0)\n\nThe correct configuration matches option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1927927"}, {"introduction": "Digital circuits operate in a dynamic environment where signals change over time.
