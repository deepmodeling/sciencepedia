A much weaker secondary component is suspected to be present at frequency $f_2 = 1010$ Hz.\n\nWhen analyzing the spectrum of a finite-length signal (effectively applying a rectangular window), each sinusoidal component produces a main peak accompanied by a series of sidelobes due to spectral leakage. The engineer is concerned that the weak secondary component at $f_2$ might be mistaken for, or obscured by, a sidelobe from the strong primary component at $f_1$.\n\nTo better visualize the spectrum, the engineer decides to append $N_{zero}$ zeros to the signal $x[n]$, creating a new signal of total length $N_{tot} = N + N_{zero}$, and then compute an $N_{tot}$-point DFT. This process, known as zero-padding, effectively interpolates the underlying continuous spectrum by providing more closely spaced frequency samples.\n\nFor this problem, assume the following two facts:\n1. The first major sidelobe in the magnitude spectrum of an $N$-point rectangularly-windowed sinusoid occurs at a frequency offset of approximately $1.4303 \\times (f_s/N)$ from the sinusoid's true frequency.\n2. To reliably distinguish the peak of the secondary component from the nearby sidelobe peak of the primary component, the engineer requires that the frequency spacing of the zero-padded DFT, let's call it $\\Delta f_{zp}$, must be no more than half the frequency separation between the true frequency of the secondary component, $f_2$, and the frequency of the first major sidelobe of the primary component.\n\nDetermine the minimum integer number of zeros, $N_{zero}$, that must be appended to the signal to satisfy the engineer's criterion.", "solution": "The zero-padded DFT frequency spacing is $\\Delta f_{zp} = \\frac{f_{s}}{N_{tot}}$ with $N_{tot} = N + N_{zero}$.
