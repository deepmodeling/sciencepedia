However, for discrete, finite-length signals, the multiplication of their $N$-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs) corresponds to $N$-point *circular* convolution in the time domain, not linear convolution.\n\nLet the original signals be $x[n]$ of length $L=10$ and $h[n]$ of length $M=9$. Their linear convolution, denoted by $y[n] = x[n] * h[n]$, is a signal of length $L_{conv} = L + M - 1$.\nIn this problem, the length of the linear convolution is:\n$$L_{conv} = 10 + 9 - 1 = 18$$\nThis means the correct linear convolution result, $y[n]$, will have 18 non-zero samples (in the general case).\n\nThe student's procedure involves zero-padding both signals to a length $N=20$, and then performing multiplication of their $N$-point DFTs followed by an $N$-point Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT). This operation computes the $N$-point circular convolution of the padded signals, $x_p[n]$ and $h_p[n]$. Let this result be $y_p[n]$.\n\nA fundamental result in digital signal processing states that the $N$-point circular convolution of two signals (which have been padded to length $N$) will be identical to their linear convolution if and only if the transform length $N$ is large enough to hold the entire result of the linear convolution without \"wrapping around\" (time-domain aliasing). This condition is:\n$$N \\ge L + M - 1$$\nIn other words, the DFT length $N$ must be greater than or equal to the length of the linear convolution, $L_{conv}$.\n\nLet's check if the student's chosen parameters satisfy this condition:\n-   The required minimum length is $L_{conv} = 18$.\n-   The student chose a DFT length of $N = 20$.\n\nWe check the inequality:\n$$20 \\ge 18$$\nThe condition is satisfied. Because the chosen DFT length ($N=20$) is greater than the required minimum length (18), the circular convolution will not result in time-domain aliasing. The resulting 20-point sequence, $y_p[n]$, will contain the 18 points of the correct linear convolution, followed by $N - L_{conv} = 20 - 18 = 2$ zero-valued samples. Therefore, the procedure successfully computes the linear convolution.\n\nLet's analyze the given options:\n-   **A: The procedure is successful. The resulting sequence $y_p[n]$ is equivalent to the correct linear convolution of $x[n]$ and $h[n]$.** This is the correct statement. The resulting 20-point sequence contains the full 18-point linear convolution result.\n-   **B: The procedure fails. The result $y_p[n]$ is a 20-point circular convolution that is affected by time-domain aliasing...** This is incorrect. Aliasing is avoided precisely because $N$ is large enough ($N \\ge 18$).\n-   **C: The procedure fails. For the method to be correct, the DFT length $N$ must be exactly equal to... 18.** This is a common misconception. The condition is an inequality ($N \\ge L+M-1$), not an equality. Any length greater than or equal to 18 is valid. Using a longer length simply appends more zeros to the final result.\n-   **D: The procedure fails. The DFT-based convolution method is only valid if the DFT length $N$ is a power of two...** This is also incorrect. Requiring the length to be a power of two is a condition for using the most efficient algorithm to compute the DFT, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
