For a unity negative feedback system, the closed-loop transfer function is given by the formula:\n$$T(s) = \\frac{G(s)}{1 + G(s)}$$\nThe stability of the system is determined by the roots of the characteristic equation, which is the denominator of the closed-loop transfer function set to zero:\n$$1 + G(s) = 0$$\nSubstitute the given forward-path transfer function $G(s) = \\frac{K}{(s+1)(s+2)(s+5)}$ into the characteristic equation:\n$$1 + \\frac{K}{(s+1)(s+2)(s+5)} = 0$$\nTo clear the fraction, we multiply the entire equation by the denominator:\n$$(s+1)(s+2)(s+5) + K = 0$$\nNow, we must expand the polynomial. Let's first multiply the first two terms:\n$$(s+1)(s+2) = s^2 + 2s + s + 2 = s^2 + 3s + 2$$\nNow, multiply this result by $(s+5)$:\n$$(s^2 + 3s + 2)(s+5) = s(s^2 + 3s + 2) + 5(s^2 + 3s + 2)$$\n$$= s^3 + 3s^2 + 2s + 5s^2 + 15s + 10$$\n$$= s^3 + 8s^2 + 17s + 10$$\nSo, the characteristic equation is:\n$$s^3 + 8s^2 + 17s + 10 + K = 0$$\nTo determine the stability, we use the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion.

The process involves constructing a Routh array from the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial, $P(s) = s^5 + s^4 + 4s^3 + 4s^2 + 3s + 3$.\n\nFirst, we set up the first two rows of the Routh array using the coefficients of the polynomial. The first row contains the coefficients of the odd powers of $s$, and the second row contains the coefficients of the even powers of $s$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\ns^5  1  4  3 \\\\\ns^4  1  4  3 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the coefficients for the $s^3$ row. Let the rows be denoted by their corresponding power of $s$. The coefficients are calculated as follows:\nThe first element of the $s^3$ row is $b_1 = -\\frac{1}{a_{2,1}} \\begin{vmatrix} a_{1,1}  a_{1,2} \\\\ a_{2,1}  a_{2,2} \\end{vmatrix}$, where $a_{n,m}$ is the element in the $n$-th row and $m$-th column of the coefficient part of the array.\n\nFor the $s^3$ row:\n$b_1 = -\\frac{1}{1} \\begin{vmatrix} 1  4 \\\\ 1  4 \\end{vmatrix} = -(1 \\cdot 4 - 1 \\cdot 4) = 0$\n$b_2 = -\\frac{1}{1} \\begin{vmatrix} 1  3 \\\\ 1  3 \\end{vmatrix} = -(1 \\cdot 3 - 1 \\cdot 3) = 0$\n$b_3 = -\\frac{1}{1} \\begin{vmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{vmatrix} = 0$\n\nSince all the elements in the $s^3$ row are zero, this indicates a special case. A row of zeros signifies that there are roots of the characteristic equation that are symmetric with respect to the origin of the s-plane. These symmetric roots could be on the imaginary axis, on the real axis, or in complex conjugate quadruplets. To find these roots, we form an auxiliary polynomial, $A(s)$, using the coefficients from the row just above the row of zeros (the $s^4$ row).\n\nThe coefficients in the $s^4$ row are $\\{1, 4, 3\\}$.

We can find the roots of $A(s)$ by solving $A(s) = 0$.\n$$s^4 + 4s^2 + 3 = 0$$\nLet $u = s^2$. The equation becomes a quadratic in $u$:\n$$u^2 + 4u + 3 = 0$$\nThis quadratic equation can be factored as:\n$$(u + 1)(u + 3) = 0$$\nThis gives us two solutions for $u$: $u = -1$ and $u = -3$.\n\nNow, we substitute back $s^2 = u$ to find the roots in terms of $s$.\nCase 1: $s^2 = -1$\n$$s = \\pm \\sqrt{-1} = \\pm j$$\nCase 2: $s^2 = -3$\n$$s = \\pm \\sqrt{-3} = \\pm j\\sqrt{3}$$\n\nBoth sets of roots, $\\{j, -j\\}$ and $\\{j\\sqrt{3}, -j\\sqrt{3}\\}$, are purely imaginary and lie on the $j\\omega$-axis.
