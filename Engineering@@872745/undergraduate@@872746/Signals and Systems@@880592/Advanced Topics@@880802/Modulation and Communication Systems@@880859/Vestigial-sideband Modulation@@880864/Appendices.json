This technique is chosen as a compromise to conserve spectral bandwidth while ensuring the robust transmission of important low-frequency signal components. The baseband video signal has a bandwidth of $W$.\n\nThe modulation process first creates a double-sideband signal centered at a carrier frequency $f_c$. A specialized VSB filter is then applied. This filter is designed to pass one of the sidebands completely. To preserve the crucial signal information near DC, the filter also allows a portion of the other sideband to pass through. This remaining portion is known as the vestigial band. The system's design specifications dictate that the width of this vestigial band, $W_v$, is a fraction of the original message bandwidth, given by the relation $W_v = \\beta W$, where $\\beta$ is a dimensionless filter design factor satisfying $0 < \\beta < 1$.\n\nAssuming the carrier frequency is much greater than the message bandwidth ($f_c \\gg W$), determine the total transmission bandwidth, $B_T$, required for the VSB-modulated signal. Express your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $W$ and $\\beta$.", "solution": "Let the message signal be $m(t)$ with a Fourier transform $M(f)$. The problem states that the bandwidth of this signal is $W$. This means that $M(f)$ is zero for $|f| > W$.\n\nThe first step in generating a VSB signal is to create a double-sideband suppressed-carrier (DSB-SC) signal by multiplying the message signal with a carrier wave $\\cos(2\\pi f_c t)$. The spectrum of this DSB-SC signal, $S_{DSB}(f)$, is given by:\n$$S_{DSB}(f) = \\frac{1}{2}[M(f - f_c) + M(f + f_c)]$$\nThis spectrum consists of two sidebands around the carrier frequency $f_c$ (for $f > 0$).\nThe upper sideband (USB) occupies the frequency range from $f_c$ to $f_c + W$.\nThe lower sideband (LSB) occupies the frequency range from $f_c - W$ to $f_c$.\nThe total bandwidth of the DSB-SC signal would be $(f_c + W) - (f_c - W) = 2W$.\n\nVSB modulation involves filtering this DSB-SC signal. The problem states that the VSB filter passes one full sideband and a vestige of the other. Let's assume the system is designed to pass the full upper sideband. The highest frequency component in the transmitted signal's spectrum, $f_{max}$, will therefore correspond to the highest frequency in the USB.\n$$f_{max} = f_c + W$$\n\nIn addition to the full USB, a vestigial portion of the LSB is also passed. The problem specifies that the width of this vestigial band is $W_v = \\beta W$. This band is adjacent to the carrier frequency within the LSB region. Therefore, the filter passes frequencies down to $f_c - W_v$. The lowest frequency component present in the transmitted signal's spectrum (for $f > 0$), $f_{min}$, is:\n$$f_{min} = f_c - W_v = f_c - \\beta W$$\n\nThe total transmission bandwidth, $B_T$, is the difference between the highest and lowest frequency components in the signal's spectrum.\n$$B_T = f_{max} - f_{min}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $f_{max}$ and $f_{min}$:\n$$B_T = (f_c + W) - (f_c - \\beta W)$$\n$$B_T = f_c + W - f_c + \\beta W$$\n$$B_T = W + \\beta W$$\nFactoring out $W$, we get the final expression for the transmission bandwidth:\n$$B_T = W(1 + \\beta)$$\nThis result shows that the VSB bandwidth is greater than the message bandwidth $W$ (like SSB) but less than the DSB bandwidth $2W$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{W(1 + \\beta)}$$", "id": "1773018"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the overall bandwidth to the fine details of the spectrum, this practice explores how a VSB filter sculpts the signal in the frequency domain.
