This exercise strips away all complexities to reveal the core mechanism: using a local oscillator to shift a modulated signal's spectrum back to its original baseband position, followed by filtering to isolate it. By using a simple constant (DC) message signal, we can clearly observe this frequency translation process without the added complexity of a time-varying message spectrum.", "problem": "A remote sensing station is used to monitor a stable environmental condition, which results in a constant DC voltage output from the sensor. This output is modeled as the message signal $m(t) = A_m$, where $A_m$ is a positive real constant in volts.

This demodulator first multiplies the incoming DSB-SC signal by a locally generated carrier signal that is perfectly synchronized in frequency and phase with the original carrier, i.e., the local carrier is also $\\cos(\\omega_c t)$. The product signal is then passed through an ideal low-pass filter (LPF).\n\nThe frequency response of this ideal LPF, denoted by $H(\\omega)$, is defined as follows: it has a constant gain of 2 for all frequencies with an absolute value less than the carrier frequency $\\omega_c$, and it completely blocks all frequencies with an absolute value greater than or equal to $\\omega_c$.
