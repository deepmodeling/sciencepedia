Zero-padding improves the fundamental frequency resolution because the frequency spacing between DFT points, given by $f_s/N$, decreases as the DFT length $N$ increases.\n\nB. Zero-padding does not improve the fundamental frequency resolution. This resolution is determined by the duration of the original non-zero signal segment (length $L$), and zero-padding only provides a more densely sampled, or interpolated, version of the underlying spectral shape.\n\nC. Zero-padding degrades the fundamental frequency resolution because adding zeros to the time-domain signal effectively convolves its spectrum with a sinc-like function, which introduces additional spectral smearing.\n\nD. Zero-padding improves the fundamental frequency resolution, but this improvement is only significant if the total length $N$ is chosen to be a power of two, leveraging the efficiency of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.\n\nE.
