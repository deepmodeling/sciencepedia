It requires the calculation of spectral leakage from a periodogram estimate of a pure sinusoidal signal under different conditions. The provided definitions are standard and self-consistent, enabling a direct and unambiguous solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds systematically, beginning from first principles.\n\n**1. Signal and Windowing Model**\n\nThe discrete-time signal is a pure sinusoid of amplitude $A=1$, sampled at a frequency $F_s$ over $N$ points. The signal is defined as:\n$$x[n] = \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi f_0 n}{F_s}\\right), \\quad n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$$\nwhere $f_0$ is the frequency of the sinusoid.\n\nThis signal is then multiplied by a window function $w[n]$ to produce the windowed signal $x_w[n]$:\n$$x_w[n] = w[n] x[n]$$\nThe problem specifies two window types:\n- **Rectangular window**: $w[n] = 1$ for all $n$.\n- **Hann window**: $w[n] = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi n}{N-1}\\right)\\right)$.\n\n**2. Power Spectrum Estimation**\n\nThe core of the problem is to construct a properly normalized, one-sided power spectrum. We begin with the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the windowed signal:\n$$X_w[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_w[n] e^{-i 2\\pi kn/N}$$\n\nTo ensure the estimated power is independent of the window function's gain, we must normalize the spectrum. Parseval's theorem for discrete signals relates the signal's energy in the time domain to its energy in the frequency domain:\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} |x_w[n]|^2 = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} |X_w[k]|^2$$\nThe average power of the windowed signal over the $N$ samples is $P_{\\text{avg},w} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} |x_w[n]|^2$. Therefore:\n$$P_{\\text{avg},w} = \\frac{1}{N^2} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} |X_w[k]|^2$$\nThe average power of the original signal $x[n]$ is related to that of the windowed signal. For a sinusoidal signal, the windowing process scales the power by a factor equal to the mean square of the window function. The estimated average power of the original signal, $P_{\\text{avg},x}$, is thus:\n$$P_{\\text{avg},x} = \\frac{P_{\\text{avg},w}}{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} w[n]^2} = \\frac{N}{\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} w[n]^2} P_{\\text{avg},w}$$\nLet's denote the sum of squared window weights as $S_2 = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} w[n]^2$. The total estimated power of the original signal is:\n$$P_{\\text{total}} = P_{\\text{avg},x} = \\frac{N}{S_2} \\left( \\frac{1}{N^2} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} |X_w[k]|^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{S_2 N} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} |X_w[k]|^2$$\nFor a real-valued input signal $x[n]$, the DFT is conjugate symmetric: $X_w[k] = X_w^*[N-k]$. This implies $|X_w[k]|^2 = |X_w[N-k]|^2$. We can construct a one-sided power spectrum $P[k]$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N/2\\}$ that preserves the total power. The summation over the two-sided spectrum can be re-written (for even $N$):\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} |X_w[k]|^2 = |X_w[0]|^2 + |X_w[N/2]|^2 + 2\\sum_{k=1}^{N/2-1} |X_w[k]|^2$$\nWe define the one-sided power spectrum $P[k]$ such that its sum equals the total average power $P_{\\text{total}}$. The components of $P[k]$ are the power contained in each frequency bin $k$:\n$$P[k] = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{S_2 N} |X_w[k]|^2 & \\text{for } k=0 \\text{ and } k=N/2 \\\\ \\frac{2}{S_2 N} |X_w[k]|^2 & \\text{for } k=1, 2, \\dots, N/2-1 \\end{cases}$$\nThe sum $\\sum_{k=0}^{N/2} P[k]$ correctly yields the total average power of the original signal. Given $x[n]$ is a sinusoid with amplitude $A=1$, its true average power is $A^2/2 = 1/2$. Our estimator $\\sum P[k]$ will approximate this value.\n\n**3. Leakage Ratio Calculation**\n\nThe spectral leakage ratio $\\mathcal{L}$ is defined as the fraction of total power lying outside the main lobe of the spectral peak.\nFirst, we find the maximum value of the power spectrum, $P_{\\max} = \\max_k P[k]$. The main lobe is operationally defined as the set of frequency bins $\\mathcal{M}$ whose power is within $-6$ decibels of the peak:\n$$\\mathcal{M} = \\left\\{k \\mid 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{P[k]}{P_{\\max}}\\right) \\ge -6\\right\\}$$\nThis inequality is equivalent to $P[k] \\ge P_{\\max} \\cdot 10^{-0.6}$.\n\nThe total power in the main lobe is $P_{\\text{lobe}} = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{M}} P[k]$. The total power across the entire spectrum is $P_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{k=0}^{N/2} P[k]$.\nThe leakage ratio is then computed as:\n$$\\mathcal{L} = 1 - \\frac{P_{\\text{lobe}}}{P_{\\text{total}}}$$\n\nThis procedure is implemented for each test case to determine the leakage ratio under the specified conditions.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the spectral leakage ratio for a sinusoidal signal under various\n    windowing and frequency conditions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # (Fs, N, f0, window_type)\n        (1024.0, 1024, 128.5, \"rectangular\"),\n        (1024.0, 1024, 128.5, \"Hann\"),\n        (1024.0, 1024, 128.0, \"rectangular\"),\n        (1024.0, 1024, 128.01, \"rectangular\"),\n        (256.0, 256, 50.3, \"rectangular\"),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        Fs, N, f0, window_type = case\n        \n        # 1.
