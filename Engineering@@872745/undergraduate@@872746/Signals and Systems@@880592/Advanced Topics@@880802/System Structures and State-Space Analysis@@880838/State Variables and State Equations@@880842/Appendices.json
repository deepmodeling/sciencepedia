The temperature of the component, $T(t)$, is influenced by its internal power generation and heat dissipation to the surroundings, which are at a constant ambient temperature $T_\\text{amb}$. The component's thermal behavior is described by its thermal capacitance $C$ and its thermal conductance to the ambient environment $G$.\n\nThe state variable of the system is defined as the temperature difference above ambient, $x(t) = T(t) - T_\\text{amb}$.
