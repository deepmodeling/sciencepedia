You will see firsthand how a single algebraic expression for a transform, $X(s)$, can correspond to three entirely different time-domain signals. This exercise [@problem_id:2900030] demonstrates that without the ROC, the Laplace transform is ambiguous, and it is the ROC that uniquely determines the nature of the signal—whether it is causal, anti-causal, or two-sided.", "problem": "Consider the bilateral Laplace transform defined by $X(s)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t)\\exp(-s t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t$, where $s=\\sigma+\\mathrm{j}\\omega$ and the integral converges on a subset of the complex plane known as the Region of Convergence (ROC). Let $X(s)=\\frac{1}{s(s+1)}$, a strictly proper rational function with simple poles at $s=0$ and $s=-1$. Without assuming causality a priori, and starting from the definition of the bilateral Laplace transform and the convergence of the defining integral at $t\\to \\pm \\infty$, determine the unique time-domain signal $x(t)$ associated with each of the following three ROCs: $\\Re\\{s\\}0$, $-1\\Re\\{s\\}0$, and $\\Re\\{s\\}-1$.

It is a standard exercise in the analysis of linear time-invariant systems using the bilateral Laplace transform. All necessary information is provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a formal solution can be constructed.\n\nThe bilateral Laplace transform of a signal $x(t)$ is given by the integral $X(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t)\\exp(-st)\\,\\mathrm{d}t$, where $s = \\sigma + j\\omega$ is a complex variable. The set of values of $s$ for which this integral converges is the Region of Convergence (ROC). The ROC is intrinsically linked to the time-domain characteristics of the signal $x(t)$.\n\nThe given Laplace transform is $X(s) = \\frac{1}{s(s+1)}$. To determine the inverse transform $x(t)$, we first perform a partial fraction expansion of $X(s)$.\nLet $X(s) = \\frac{A}{s} + \\frac{B}{s+1}$.\nThe coefficients $A$ and $B$ are the residues at the respective poles.\nThe pole at $s=0$ gives the residue $A$:\n$$A = \\lim_{s \\to 0} s X(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\frac{1}{s+1} = \\frac{1}{0+1} = 1$$\nThe pole at $s=-1$ gives the residue $B$:\n$$B = \\lim_{s \\to -1} (s+1) X(s) = \\lim_{s \\to -1} \\frac{1}{s} = \\frac{1}{-1} = -1$$\nThus, the partial fraction expansion is:\n$$X(s) = \\frac{1}{s} - \\frac{1}{s+1}$$\nThe function $X(s)$ has two terms, one corresponding to a pole at $s=0$ and the other to a pole at $s=-1$. The key to finding the unique time-domain signal $x(t)$ for a given ROC is to recognize that each term in the partial fraction expansion can correspond to either a right-sided or a left-sided signal.\n\nThe fundamental transform pairs are:\n1. For a right-sided signal $\\exp(at)u(t)$, the Laplace transform is $\\frac{1}{s-a}$ with ROC $\\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\} > a$.\n2. For a left-sided signal $-\\exp(at)u(-t)$, the Laplace transform is also $\\frac{1}{s-a}$, but with ROC $\\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\}  a$.\n\nThe ROC of a sum of signals is the intersection of the individual ROCs. The boundaries of any ROC must be defined by poles or extend to infinity. For a rational function like $X(s)$, the ROC will be a vertical strip or a half-plane in the $s$-plane, bounded by lines of constant $\\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\}$ passing through the poles. The poles are at $\\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\}=0$ and $\\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\}=-1$. The lines $\\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\}=0$ and $\\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\}=-1$ divide the complex plane into three regions, which correspond exactly to the three cases given in the problem.\n\nCase 1: ROC is $\\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\} > 0$.\nThis region is to the right of both poles at $s=0$ and $s=-1$. For the overall ROC to be $\\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\} > 0$, both components of the signal must be right-sided.\nThe term $\\frac{1}{s}$ corresponds to the right-sided signal $u(t)$, which has an ROC of $\\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\} > 0$.\nThe term $\\frac{1}{s+1}$ corresponds to the right-sided signal $\\exp(-t)u(t)$, which has an ROC of $\\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\} > -1$.\nThe intersection of these two ROCs is $(\\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\} > 0) \\cap (\\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\} > -1) = (\\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\} > 0)$, which is consistent with the given ROC.\nTherefore, the corresponding time-domain signal, which we denote as $x_1(t)$, is the sum of these two right-sided signals:\n$$x_1(t) = u(t) - \\exp(-t)u(t) = (1 - \\exp(-t))u(t)$$\nThis signal is purely right-sided (causal, as it is zero for $t0$) because its ROC is the rightmost possible region.\n\nCase 2: ROC is $-1  \\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\}  0$.\nThis region is a vertical strip between the two poles. This implies a two-sided signal.\nThe ROC is to the left of the pole at $s=0$, so the term $\\frac{1}{s}$ must correspond to a left-sided signal. This is $-u(-t)$, with ROC $\\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\}  0$.\nThe ROC is to the right of the pole at $s=-1$, so the term $\\frac{1}{s+1}$ must correspond to a right-sided signal. This is $\\exp(-t)u(t)$, with ROC $\\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\} > -1$.\nThe intersection of these ROCs is $(\\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\}  0) \\cap (\\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\} > -1) = (-1  \\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\}  0)$, consistent with the given ROC.\nThe total time-domain signal, $x_2(t)$, is the sum:\n$$x_2(t) = -u(-t) - \\exp(-t)u(t)$$\nThis signal is two-sided, as it is non-zero for both $t0$ and $t0$.\n\nCase 3: ROC is $\\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\}  -1$.\nThis region is to the left of both poles at $s=0$ and $s=-1$. This implies that the time-domain signal must be entirely left-sided.\nThe term $\\frac{1}{s}$ corresponds to the left-sided signal $-u(-t)$, with ROC $\\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\}  0$.\nThe term $\\frac{1}{s+1}$ corresponds to the left-sided signal $-\\exp(-t)u(-t)$, with ROC $\\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\}  -1$.\nThe intersection of these two ROCs is $(\\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\}  0) \\cap (\\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\}  -1) = (\\operatorname{Re}\\{s\\}  -1)$, which is consistent with the given ROC.\nTherefore, the time-domain signal, $x_3(t)$, is the sum of these two left-sided signals:\n$$x_3(t) = -u(-t) - (-\\exp(-t)u(-t)) = -u(-t) + \\exp(-t)u(-t) = (\\exp(-t) - 1)u(-t)$$\nThis signal is purely left-sided (anti-causal, as it is zero for $t0$) because its ROC is the leftmost possible region.\n\nIn summary, the specific ROC uniquely determines the sidedness of the time-domain signal by dictating whether each pole's contribution is right-sided or left-sided.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n(1 - \\exp(-t))u(t)  -u(-t) - \\exp(-t)u(t)  (\\exp(-t) - 1)u(-t)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2900030"}, {"introduction": "Building on the previous concept, this exercise applies ROC analysis to determine the fundamental properties of a Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system.
