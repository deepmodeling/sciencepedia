The expression for $X(e^{j\\omega})$ is:\n$$X(e^{j\\omega}) = \\frac{e^{-j5\\omega}}{1+0.2e^{-j\\omega}}$$\nWe can recognize that this expression is a product of two terms: a complex exponential term $e^{-j5\\omega}$ and a rational function of $e^{-j\\omega}$. This structure suggests the use of the time-shifting property of the DTFT. The time-shifting property states that if a signal $y[n]$ has a DTFT $Y(e^{j\\omega})$, then a time-shifted version of the signal, $y[n-n_0]$, has a DTFT given by $e^{-j\\omega n_0} Y(e^{j\\omega})$.\n\nLet's define a simpler DTFT, $Y(e^{j\\omega})$, as:\n$$Y(e^{j\\omega}) = \\frac{1}{1+0.2e^{-j\\omega}}$$\nWith this definition, we can write the original DTFT as:\n$$X(e^{j\\omega}) = e^{-j5\\omega} Y(e^{j\\omega})$$\nComparing this to the time-shifting property, we can identify a time shift of $n_0 = 5$. Thus, if we can find the inverse DTFT of $Y(e^{j\\omega})$, which we will call $y[n]$, then our desired signal $x[n]$ will be $y[n-5]$.\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse DTFT of $Y(e^{j\\omega})$.

Since $|-0.2| = 0.2  1$, the condition for convergence is met, and we can directly apply the transform pair. The inverse DTFT of $Y(e^{j\\omega})$ is:\n$$y[n] = (-0.2)^n u[n]$$\nFinally, we apply the time-shifting property. Since $x[n] = y[n-n_0]$ with $n_0=5$, we substitute $(n-5)$ for every occurrence of $n$ in the expression for $y[n]$:\n$$x[n] = y[n-5] = (-0.2)^{n-5} u[n-5]$$\nThe term $u[n-5]$ indicates that the sequence is zero for all $n  5$.
