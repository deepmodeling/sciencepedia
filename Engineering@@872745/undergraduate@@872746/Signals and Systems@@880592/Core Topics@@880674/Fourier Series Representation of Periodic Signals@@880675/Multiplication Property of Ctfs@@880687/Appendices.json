This practice explores amplitude modulation by multiplying a band-limited baseband signal with a cosine carrier. By calculating the Fourier coefficients of the resulting signal [@problem_id:1736968], you will see precisely how the multiplication property manifests as a shift of the original signal's spectrum, a fundamental concept in frequency-division multiplexing.", "problem": "In a simplified model of a frequency-division multiplexing system, a periodic baseband signal $x(t)$ with fundamental angular frequency $\\omega_0$ is modulated onto a carrier. The signal $x(t)$ is band-limited, meaning its Fourier series coefficients, denoted by $a_k$, are non-zero only for a finite range of harmonic indices. Specifically, the coefficients are defined as $a_k = (\\frac{1}{3})^{|k|}$ for all integer indices $k$ such that $|k| \\le N$, and $a_k = 0$ for all $|k| > N$. For this particular system, the signal bandwidth is limited by $N=5$.\n\nThe modulation is performed by multiplying $x(t)$ with a periodic carrier signal $p(t) = \\cos(M \\omega_0 t)$, resulting in a transmitted signal $y(t) = x(t) p(t)$. Due to a configuration error, the integer parameter for the carrier frequency was set to $M=3$.\n\nLet the Fourier series coefficients of the transmitted signal $y(t)$ be denoted by $b_k$. Calculate the value of the coefficient $b_2$. Express your answer as an exact fraction in simplest form.", "solution": "The problem asks for the Fourier series coefficient $b_2$ of the signal $y(t)$, which is the product of two periodic signals, $x(t)$ and $p(t)$, both having the same fundamental period $T_0 = 2\\pi/\\omega_0$. The signal $y(t)$ is given by $y(t) = x(t) p(t)$.\n\nThe multiplication property of the Continuous-Time Fourier Series (CTFS) states that if a signal $y(t)$ is the product of two periodic signals $x(t)$ and $p(t)$ with the same period, its Fourier series coefficients $b_k$ are given by the discrete-time convolution of the coefficients of $x(t)$ (let's call them $a_k$) and the coefficients of $p(t)$ (let's call them $c_k$). The convolution is expressed as:\n$$b_k = \\sum_{l=-\\infty}^{\\infty} a_l c_{k-l}$$\n\nFirst, we need to find the Fourier series coefficients $c_k$ of the carrier signal $p(t) = \\cos(M \\omega_0 t)$.

Since $c_{k-l}$ is non-zero only when $k-l = M$ (which implies $l=k-M$) or when $k-l = -M$ (which implies $l=k+M$), the infinite sum reduces to just two terms:\n$$b_k = a_{k-M} c_M + a_{k+M} c_{-M}$$\nSubstituting the values for $c_M$ and $c_{-M}$:\n$$b_k = a_{k-M} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + a_{k+M} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} (a_{k-M} + a_{k+M})$$\n\nThe problem asks for the specific coefficient $b_2$ and provides the value $M=3$.
