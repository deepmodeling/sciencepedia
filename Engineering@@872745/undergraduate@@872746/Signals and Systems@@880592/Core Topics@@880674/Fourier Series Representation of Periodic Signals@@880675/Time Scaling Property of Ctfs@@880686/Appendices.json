However, this is not necessarily the *fundamental* frequency. The fundamental frequency is the greatest common divisor of all the frequencies present in the signal's spectrum.\n\nWe are told that the coefficients $a_k$ are non-zero only when the index $k$ is an integer multiple of 4. This means we can write $k = 4m$ for some integer $m$.

In this case, that frequency is:\n$$\\omega_{x} = 4\\omega_0$$\nSubstituting the given value of $\\omega_0 = 8\\pi$ rad/s, we find the true fundamental frequency of $x(t)$:\n$$\\omega_{x} = 4 \\times (8\\pi \\text{ rad/s}) = 32\\pi \\text{ rad/s}$$\nThe fundamental period of $x(t)$ is therefore $T_x = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega_x} = \\frac{2\\pi}{32\\pi} = \\frac{1}{16}$ s.\n\nStep 2: Determine the fundamental frequency of the time-scaled signal $y(t)$.\n\nThe new signal is defined as $y(t) = x(t/2)$. This represents a time expansion (the signal is \"slowed down\" by a factor of 2). We need to find the fundamental period, $T_y$, of $y(t)$. By definition, $T_y$ is the smallest positive value such that $y(t+T_y) = y(t)$ for all $t$.\n\nUsing the definition of $y(t)$, we have:\n$$y(t+T_y) = x\\left(\\frac{t+T_y}{2}\\right) = x\\left(\\frac{t}{2} + \\frac{T_y}{2}\\right)$$\nFor this to be equal to $y(t) = x(t/2)$, the term $T_y/2$ must be equal to an integer multiple of the fundamental period of $x(t)$, which is $T_x$. To find the *fundamental* period of $y(t)$, we seek the smallest positive $T_y$, which corresponds to setting $T_y/2$ equal to $T_x$:\n$$\\frac{T_y}{2} = T_x$$\n$$T_y = 2 T_x$$\nThis shows that the fundamental period of $y(t)$ is twice the fundamental period of $x(t)$.
