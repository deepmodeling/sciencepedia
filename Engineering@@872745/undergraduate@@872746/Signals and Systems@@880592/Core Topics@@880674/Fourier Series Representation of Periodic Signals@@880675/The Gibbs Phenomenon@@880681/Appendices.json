This exercise challenges you to compare the overshoot for two square waves that have the same jump magnitude but different DC offsets.

The Gibbs phenomenon manifests as an overshoot near a jump discontinuity. We define the magnitude of this overshoot, $S$, as the limiting difference between the first maximum value of the partial sum after the discontinuity and the actual signal value after the discontinuity. For the upward jump at $t=0$ for our signals, this is given by:\n$$S = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\left( \\left[ \\max_{0  t  T_0/2} x_N(t) \\right] - x(0^+) \\right)$$\nwhere $x(0^+)$ is the limit of the signal as $t$ approaches $0$ from the positive side.\n\nLet $S_1$ be the magnitude of the overshoot for the signal $x_1(t)$, and let $S_2$ be the magnitude of the overshoot for the signal $x_2(t)$.

The relationship cannot be determined without knowing the value of the period $T_0$.", "solution": "The core of this problem is to understand how a Direct Current (DC) offset affects the Fourier series representation of a signal and, consequently, the Gibbs phenomenon.\n\nFirst, let's establish the relationship between the two signals, $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$. By observing their definitions, we can see that $x_1(t)$ is simply the signal $x_2(t)$ shifted vertically by a constant value.\nFor $0  t  T_0/2$: $x_1(t) = A$ and $x_2(t) = A/2$. Here, $x_1(t) = x_2(t) + A/2$.\nFor $T_0/2  t  T_0$: $x_1(t) = 0$ and $x_2(t) = -A/2$. Here, $x_1(t) = x_2(t) + A/2$.\nThus, for all $t$ where the signals are defined, we have the relationship:\n$$x_1(t) = x_2(t) + \\frac{A}{2}$$\n\nThe Fourier series is a linear operator. This means that the Fourier series of a sum of signals is the sum of their individual Fourier series. Let $x_{1,N}(t)$ and $x_{2,N}(t)$ be the $N$-th order partial sums of the Fourier series for $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$, respectively.\n\nThe signal $A/2$ is a constant DC signal. Its Fourier series representation is simply the constant itself. All harmonics (AC components) are zero. Therefore, the $N$-th partial sum for the constant signal $A/2$ is just $A/2$.\n\nApplying the linearity property to the relationship $x_1(t) = x_2(t) + A/2$, the partial sum for $x_1(t)$ is:\n$$x_{1,N}(t) = x_{2,N}(t) + \\frac{A}{2}$$\n\nNow, let's use the given definition of the overshoot magnitude, $S$.\nFor the first signal, $x_1(t)$, the overshoot magnitude $S_1$ is:\n$$S_1 = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\left( \\left[ \\max_{0  t  T_0/2} x_{1,N}(t) \\right] - x_1(0^+) \\right)$$\nFrom the definition of $x_1(t)$, the value of the signal just after the jump at $t=0$ is $x_1(0^+) = A$. So,\n$$S_1 = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\left( \\left[ \\max_{0  t  T_0/2} x_{1,N}(t) \\right] - A \\right)$$\nNow, we substitute the relationship between the partial sums, $x_{1,N}(t) = x_{2,N}(t) + A/2$:\n$$S_1 = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\left( \\left[ \\max_{0  t  T_0/2} \\left( x_{2,N}(t) + \\frac{A}{2} \\right) \\right] - A \\right)$$\nThe maximum of a function plus a constant is the maximum of the function plus that constant. That is, $\\max(f(t)+C) = \\max(f(t)) + C$. Applying this property:\n$$S_1 = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\left( \\left[ \\left( \\max_{0  t  T_0/2} x_{2,N}(t) \\right) + \\frac{A}{2} \\right] - A \\right)$$\nSimplifying the expression inside the limit:\n$$S_1 = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\left( \\left[ \\max_{0  t  T_0/2} x_{2,N}(t) \\right] - \\frac{A}{2} \\right)$$\n\nNow, let's look at the expression for the overshoot magnitude $S_2$ for the signal $x_2(t)$:\n$$S_2 = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\left( \\left[ \\max_{0  t  T_0/2} x_{2,N}(t) \\right] - x_2(0^+) \\right)$$\nFrom the definition of $x_2(t)$, the value of the signal just after the jump at $t=0$ is $x_2(0^+) = A/2$. So,\n$$S_2 = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\left( \\left[ \\max_{0  t  T_0/2} x_{2,N}(t) \\right] - \\frac{A}{2} \\right)$$\nBy comparing the derived expression for $S_1$ with the expression for $S_2$, we see that they are identical.\nTherefore, $S_1 = S_2$.\n\nConceptually, the Gibbs phenomenon (the overshoot and ringing) is caused by the non-uniform convergence of the Fourier series at a discontinuity. This behavior is determined by the high-frequency components (the AC components) of the signal, which define its \"shape\". Adding a DC offset, as we did to get from $x_2(t)$ to $x_1(t)$, only shifts the entire signal and its Fourier series approximation vertically by the same amount. The difference between the peak of the approximation and the signal's level, which is the overshoot, remains unchanged. The magnitude of the overshoot is proportional to the size of the jump discontinuity. For both signals, the jump at $t=0$ is from their lower value to their upper value.\nFor $x_1(t)$, the jump is $J_1 = A - 0 = A$.\nFor $x_2(t)$, the jump is $J_2 = A/2 - (-A/2) = A$.\nSince the jump magnitudes are identical, the overshoot magnitudes must also be identical.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1761432"}, {"introduction": "A common question that arises is whether the specific shape of a signal, beyond its jump, influences the severity of the Gibbs overshoot.
