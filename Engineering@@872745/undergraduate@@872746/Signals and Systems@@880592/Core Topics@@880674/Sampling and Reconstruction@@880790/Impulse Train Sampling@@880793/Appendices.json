The limits of this period are $\\pm f_s/2 = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{4}{3}W\\right) = \\pm \\frac{2}{3}W$.\n\nLet's analyze the sum for $Y(f)$ for a frequency $f$ in the range $0 \\le f \\le \\frac{2}{3}W$.\nThe terms in the sum are $X(f-kf_s)$. We need to determine which values of $k$ yield non-zero terms. A term is non-zero only if $|f-kf_s| < W$.\n\nFor $k=0$: The term is $X(f)$, which is non-zero for $|f| < W$. This is true for the entire range of interest $0 \\le f \\le \\frac{2}{3}W$.\n\nFor $k=1$: The term is $X(f - f_s) = X(f - \\frac{4}{3}W)$.
