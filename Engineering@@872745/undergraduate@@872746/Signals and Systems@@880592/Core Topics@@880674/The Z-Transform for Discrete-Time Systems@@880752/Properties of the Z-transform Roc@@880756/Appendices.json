For a right-sided sequence with a single pole at $z=a$ and no zeros, a representative z-transform is $X(z)=\\frac{C}{1-a z^{-1}}$ with region of convergence $|z|>|a|$. Therefore, since $x_{1}[n]$ is causal with a single pole at $z=0.5$ and no zeros, its z-transform can be written as $X_{1}(z)=\\frac{C_{1}}{1-0.5\\,z^{-1}}$ with ROC $|z|>0.5$.

The zeros of the system function do not constrain the boundaries of the ROC. For the given $H(z)$, there is a single pole at $z=p_0$. A single pole partitions the z-plane into two possible regions for the ROC:\n1.  The region *inside* the circle of radius $|p_0|$, i.e., $|z| < |p_0|$. This ROC corresponds to a left-sided (anti-causal) impulse response.\n2.  The region *outside* the circle of radius $|p_0|$, i.e., $|z| > |p_0|$. This ROC corresponds to a right-sided (causal) impulse response.\n\nWe must choose the ROC that satisfies the stability condition, which means it must contain the unit circle $|z|=1$. We are given that the pole location $p_0$ satisfies $|p_0| < 1$.\n\nLet's evaluate the two possible ROCs with this information:\n- Case 1: If the ROC were $|z| < |p_0|$. Since we are given $|p_0| < 1$, this region is entirely contained within the unit circle. For any $z$ in this ROC, $|z| < |p_0| < 1$, so it is not possible for $|z|$ to be equal to 1. Thus, this ROC does not include the unit circle. A system with this ROC would be unstable.\n\n- Case 2: If the ROC is $|z| > |p_0|$. Since we are given $|p_0| < 1$, this region represents all points outside a circle whose radius is less than 1. The unit circle, defined by $|z|=1$, is entirely contained within this region. Therefore, this choice of ROC satisfies the condition for system stability.\n\nThe location of the zero, $z_0$, does not affect the determination of the ROC's boundaries. The condition $|z_0| < 1$ simply indicates that the zero is also inside the unit circle, which is allowed. The ROC is a region of the z-plane where the z-transform converges, and it cannot contain any poles. Zeros can, and often do, lie within the ROC.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only possible ROC for a stable system with a pole at $p_0$ where $|p_0| < 1$ is $|z| > |p_0|$.

This represents an annular region, which requires at least two poles. Also, given $|z_0| < 1$ and $|p_0| < 1$, the relation between $|z_0|$ and $|p_0|$ is not specified, so this region might not even be well-defined (e.g., if $|z_0| > |p_0|$).\n\nTherefore, the correct ROC for the stable system is $|z| > |p_0|$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1745559"}, {"introduction": "Let's now apply our knowledge to analyze a complete and widely used digital filter from start to finish.
