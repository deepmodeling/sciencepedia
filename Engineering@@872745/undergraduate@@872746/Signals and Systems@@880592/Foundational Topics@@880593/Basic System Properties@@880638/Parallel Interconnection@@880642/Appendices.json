Consider a discrete-time system, with overall impulse response $h[n]$, constructed to approximate a specific target non-causal impulse response, $h_d[n]$.\n\nThe approximating system $h[n]$ is composed of two subsystems connected in parallel. The first subsystem is a single-sample time advance unit, characterized by an impulse response $h_1[n] = \\delta[n+1]$, where $\\delta[n]$ is the Kronecker delta function. The second subsystem is a causal $N$-tap Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter, with an impulse response denoted by $h_c[n]$. The causality and finite length constraints mean that $h_c[n]$ can be non-zero only for sample indices $n$ in the range $0 \\le n \\le N-1$.\n\nThe target impulse response to be approximated is given by the two-sided exponential sequence $h_d[n] = a^{|n|}$, where $a$ is a real-valued constant satisfying $0  a  1$.\n\nThe objective is to design the FIR filter $h_c[n]$ to minimize the total least-squares error, defined as $E = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} (h_d[n] - h[n])^2$. Your task is to first determine the impulse response of the optimal filter $h_c[n]$ and then to calculate the resulting minimum value of this error, denoted as $E_{min}$.\n\nExpress your final answer for the minimum error $E_{min}$ as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of the parameters $a$ and $N$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum least-squares error $E_{min}$ when approximating a target impulse response $h_d[n]$ with a system $h[n]$. The system $h[n]$ is a parallel combination of a time advance unit $h_1[n]$ and a causal $N$-tap FIR filter $h_c[n]$.\n\nFirst, we write the impulse response of the total system. Since the subsystems are in parallel, their impulse responses add up:\n$h[n] = h_1[n] + h_c[n] = \\delta[n+1] + h_c[n]$.\n\nThe FIR filter $h_c[n]$ has $N$ taps and is causal, so it can be expressed as a weighted sum of delayed impulses:\n$h_c[n] = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} c_k \\delta[n-k]$,\nwhere $\\{c_k\\}$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, N-1$ are the filter coefficients (taps) that we need to determine.\n\nThe total least-squares error $E$ is given by:\n$E = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} (h_d[n] - h[n])^2 = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left(h_d[n] - \\left(\\delta[n+1] + \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} c_k \\delta[n-k]\\right)\\right)^2$.\n\nOur goal is to minimize $E$ by choosing the optimal values for the coefficients $c_k$. We can analyze the sum term by term for different ranges of the index $n$:\n\n1.  For $n = -1$: The term in the sum is $(h_d[-1] - \\delta[-1+1] - 0)^2 = (h_d[-1] - 1)^2$. This term is independent of the coefficients $c_k$. With $h_d[n] = a^{|n|}$, this evaluates to $(a^{|-1|}-1)^2 = (a-1)^2$.\n\n2.  For $n$ in the range $\\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$: For any specific index $n=m$ in this range, the FIR filter term is $c_m$, while the $\\delta[n+1]$ term is zero. The term in the sum is $(h_d[m] - c_m)^2$.\n\n3.  For all other values of $n$ (i.e., $n  -1$ or $n \\ge N$): Both $\\delta[n+1]$ and $h_c[n]$ are zero. The term in the sum is $(h_d[n])^2$. These terms are also independent of the coefficients $c_k$.\n\nCombining these observations, we can rewrite the total error $E$ as:\n$E = (h_d[-1] - 1)^2 + \\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} (h_d[m] - c_m)^2 + \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{-1, 0, \\dots, N-1\\}} (h_d[n])^2$.\n\nTo minimize $E$ with respect to the coefficients $\\{c_m\\}$, we only need to minimize the part of the expression that depends on them, which is the sum $\\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} (h_d[m] - c_m)^2$. The other terms are constant with respect to $\\{c_m\\}$. This sum is a sum of non-negative squares. The minimum value of this sum is achieved when each individual term is minimized. The minimum value of $(h_d[m] - c_m)^2$ is zero, which occurs when $c_m = h_d[m]$.\n\nTherefore, the optimal coefficients for the FIR filter are:\n$c_m = h_d[m] = a^{|m|} = a^m$ for $m = 0, 1, \\dots, N-1$.\n\nWith these optimal coefficients, the term $\\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} (h_d[m] - c_m)^2$ becomes zero. The minimum error $E_{min}$ is then the sum of the remaining terms:\n$E_{min} = (h_d[-1] - 1)^2 + \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{-1, 0, \\dots, N-1\\}} (h_d[n])^2$.\n\nThe set of indices $\\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{-1, 0, \\dots, N-1\\}$ can be split into two disjoint sets: $\\{n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid n \\le -2\\}$ and $\\{n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid n \\ge N\\}$.\nSo, we can write $E_{min}$ as:\n$E_{min} = (a-1)^2 + \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{-2} (h_d[n])^2 + \\sum_{n=N}^{\\infty} (h_d[n])^2$.\n\nNow, we substitute $h_d[n] = a^{|n|}$ and evaluate the sums.\n$E_{min} = (a-1)^2 + \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{-2} (a^{|n|})^2 + \\sum_{n=N}^{\\infty} (a^{|n|})^2$.\n$E_{min} = (a-1)^2 + \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{-2} a^{2|n|} + \\sum_{n=N}^{\\infty} a^{2|n|}$.\n\nFor the first sum, let $k = -n$. As $n$ goes from $-2$ to $-\\infty$, $k$ goes from $2$ to $\\infty$.\n$\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{-2} a^{2|n|} = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{-2} a^{-2n} = \\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty} a^{2k}$.\nThis is a geometric series with first term $a^4$ and ratio $r = a^2$. Since $0  a  1$, we have $0  a^2  1$, so the series converges. The sum is $\\frac{\\text{first term}}{1-\\text{ratio}} = \\frac{a^4}{1-a^2}$.\n\nFor the second sum, the indices $n$ are positive, so $|n|=n$.\n$\\sum_{n=N}^{\\infty} a^{2|n|} = \\sum_{n=N}^{\\infty} a^{2n}$.\nThis is a geometric series with first term $a^{2N}$ and ratio $r = a^2$.
