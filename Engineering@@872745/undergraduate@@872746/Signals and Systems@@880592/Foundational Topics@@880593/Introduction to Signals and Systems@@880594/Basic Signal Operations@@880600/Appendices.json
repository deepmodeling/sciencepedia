The condition becomes $\\alpha t-\\beta<0$. We can rearrange this to $\\alpha t < \\beta$. Since the term $\\alpha t$ can take any value in the interval $(-\\infty, 0)$ as $t$ varies in $(-\\infty, 0)$, the inequality must hold for all values in this interval. This is only possible if $\\beta$ is greater than or equal to the supremum of the interval, which is 0. So, we must have $\\beta \\ge 0$. If $\\beta < 0$, we could pick a $t$ close to 0 (e.g., $t=\\beta/(2\\alpha)$) for which $\\alpha t > \\beta$, violating the condition. Therefore, for $\\alpha>0$, the condition is $\\beta\\ge 0$.\n\n2) If $\\alpha=0$: The condition simplifies to $-\\beta<0$, which means $\\beta>0$. If $\\beta \\le 0$, then the argument $-\\beta \\ge 0$. We could then pick a causal signal $x(u)$ that is non-zero at $u=-\\beta$, making $y(t)=x(-\\beta)$ a non-zero constant for all $t$, which violates causality. Hence for $\\alpha=0$, we need $\\beta>0$.\n\n3) If $\\alpha<0$: For $t<0$, the term $\\alpha t$ is positive. As $t$ approaches $-\\infty$, $\\alpha t$ approaches $+\\infty$. The term $\\alpha t - \\beta$ will therefore become positive for any finite $\\beta$ when $t$ is sufficiently negative. This violates the condition $\\alpha t-\\beta<0$. Therefore, no value of $\\beta$ can work if $\\alpha<0$.\n\nCombining the valid cases, the complete set of conditions is: ($\\alpha>0$ and $\\beta\\ge 0$) or ($\\alpha=0$ and $\\beta>0$).
