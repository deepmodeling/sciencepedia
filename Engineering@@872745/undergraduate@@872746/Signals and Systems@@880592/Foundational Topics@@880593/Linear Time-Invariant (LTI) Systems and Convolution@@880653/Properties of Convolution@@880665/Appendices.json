The solution involves two main steps: first, determining the function $y(t)$ by performing the convolution, and second, integrating the square of $y(t)$ to find its energy.\n\n**Step 1: Compute the convolution $y(t) = x(t) * x(t)$.**\n\nThe signal $x(t) = u(t) - u(t-T)$ is a rectangular pulse of amplitude 1 for $0 \\le t  T$ and 0 otherwise.
