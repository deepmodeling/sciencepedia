The signal $x[n]$ is periodic if both of its components are periodic. The overall fundamental period will be the least common multiple of the fundamental periods of the components.\n\nFirst, let's find the fundamental period $N_1$ of the first component, $x_1[n]$. A discrete-time complex exponential sequence $\\exp(j\\omega_1 n)$ is periodic if and only if its angular frequency $\\omega_1$ is a rational multiple of $2\\pi$. The fundamental period $N_1$ is the smallest positive integer for which $\\omega_1 N_1$ is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$.

Thus, the fundamental period of the first component is $N_1 = 20$.\n\nNext, we find the fundamental period $N_2$ of the second component, $x_2[n]$. We follow the same procedure for $\\omega_2 = \\frac{4\\pi}{15}$.\n$$ \\frac{\\omega_2}{2\\pi} = \\frac{4\\pi / 15}{2\\pi} = \\frac{4}{30} = \\frac{2}{15} $$\nThis fraction is irreducible since the greatest common divisor of 2 and 15 is 1. Thus, the fundamental period of the second component is $N_2 = 15$.\n\nThe fundamental period $N$ of the overall signal $x[n]$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the individual fundamental periods $N_1$ and $N_2$.\n$$ N = \\text{lcm}(N_1, N_2) = \\text{lcm}(20, 15) $$\nTo calculate the lcm, we find the prime factorizations:\n$20 = 2^2 \\cdot 5$\n$15 = 3 \\cdot 5$\nThe lcm is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present:\n$N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1 = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 60$.\nSo, the fundamental period of the signal $x[n]$ is $N=60$.\n\nThis periodicity means that $x[n] = x[n+60k]$ for any integer $k$. We need to calculate $x[125]$. We can simplify the index by using the modulo operator:\n$$ x[125] = x[125 \\pmod{60}] $$\nDividing 125 by 60 gives:\n$125 = 2 \\times 60 + 5$.\nSo, $125 \\pmod{60} = 5$.
