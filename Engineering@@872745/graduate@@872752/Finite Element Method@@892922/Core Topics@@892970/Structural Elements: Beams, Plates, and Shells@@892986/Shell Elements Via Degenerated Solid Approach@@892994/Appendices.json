It is found to be self-contained, scientifically grounded in the classical theory of plates and shells, and mathematically well-posed. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental premise of the degenerated solid approach (DSA) is to describe the kinematics of a three-dimensional body using the motion of its midsurface and a director vector. For a flat plate, the position vector $\\mathbf{X}$ of an arbitrary point in the undeformed configuration is given by\n$$\n\\mathbf{X}(x, y, z) = \\mathbf{x}_m(x,y) + z \\mathbf{e}_3\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{x}_m(x,y) = x \\mathbf{e}_1 + y \\mathbf{e}_2$ is the position vector of a point on the midsurface, and $\\mathbf{e}_3$ is the unit normal director. The coordinate $z$ lies in the interval $[-t/2, t/2]$.\n\nAfter deformation, the position of the same material point is described by\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}(x, y, z) = \\mathbf{x}_m^{\\text{def}}(x,y) + z \\mathbf{d}(x,y)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{x}_m^{\\text{def}}$ is the deformed position of the midsurface point and $\\mathbf{d}$ is the deformed director. The displacement vector $\\mathbf{u}(x, y, z)$ is the difference between the deformed and undeformed positions:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}(x, y, z) = \\mathbf{x}(x, y, z) - \\mathbf{X}(x, y, z) = (\\mathbf{x}_m^{\\text{def}} - \\mathbf{x}_m) + z (\\mathbf{d} - \\mathbf{e}_3)\n$$\nLet the displacement of the midsurface be $\\mathbf{u}_m(x,y) = u(x,y)\\mathbf{e}_1 + v(x,y)\\mathbf{e}_2 + w(x,y)\\mathbf{e}_3$. The problem specifies a state of pure bending, which implies the midsurface experiences no membrane deformation. For small displacements, this allows us to set the in-plane midsurface displacements to zero, $u(x,y) = 0$ and $v(x,y) = 0$. Thus, the midsurface displacement is purely transverse: $\\mathbf{u}_m(x,y) = w(x,y)\\mathbf{e}_3$.\n\nThe kinematic assumptions of Kirchhoff-Love theory, as specified, dictate that the director remains straight and normal to the deformed midsurface. The deformed midsurface is parameterized by $\\mathbf{r}(x,y) = x \\mathbf{e}_1 + y \\mathbf{e}_2 + w(x,y) \\mathbf{e}_3$. The tangent vectors to this surface are:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_{,x} = \\mathbf{e}_1 + w_{,x} \\mathbf{e}_3 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathbf{r}_{,y} = \\mathbf{e}_2 + w_{,y} \\mathbf{e}_3\n$$\nThe normal vector to the deformed midsurface is found by the cross product:\n$$\n\\mathbf{N} = \\mathbf{r}_{,x} \\times \\mathbf{r}_{,y} = (\\mathbf{e}_1 + w_{,x} \\mathbf{e}_3) \\times (\\mathbf{e}_2 + w_{,y} \\mathbf{e}_3) = -w_{,x} \\mathbf{e}_1 - w_{,y} \\mathbf{e}_2 + \\mathbf{e}_3\n$$\nThe deformed director $\\mathbf{d}$ is the unit vector in the direction of $\\mathbf{N}$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{d} = \\frac{\\mathbf{N}}{|\\mathbf{N}|} = \\frac{-w_{,x} \\mathbf{e}_1 - w_{,y} \\mathbf{e}_2 + \\mathbf{e}_3}{\\sqrt{w_{,x}^2 + w_{,y}^2 + 1}}\n$$\nUnder the small-rotation assumption, the slopes $w_{,x}$ and $w_{,y}$ are small quantities. Thus, the denominator can be linearized: $\\sqrt{1 + w_{,x}^2 + w_{,y}^2} \\approx 1$. The linearized deformed director is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathbf{d} \\approx -w_{,x} \\mathbf{e}_1 - w_{,y} \\mathbf{e}_2 + \\mathbf{e}_3\n$$\nSubstituting the midsurface displacement and the linearized director into the general displacement equation yields the displacement field components throughout the thickness:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}(x, y, z) = w(x,y)\\mathbf{e}_3 + z ((-w_{,x} \\mathbf{e}_1 - w_{,y} \\mathbf{e}_2 + \\mathbf{e}_3) - \\mathbf{e}_3) = -z w_{,x} \\mathbf{e}_1 - z w_{,y} \\mathbf{e}_2 + w \\mathbf{e}_3\n$$\nThe components of the displacement vector $\\mathbf{u} = u_x \\mathbf{e}_1 + u_y \\mathbf{e}_2 + u_z \\mathbf{e}_3$ are:\n$$\nu_x(x,y,z) = -z w_{,x}(x,y)\n$$\n$$\nu_y(x,y,z) = -z w_{,y}(x,y)\n$$\n$$\nu_z(x,y,z) = w(x,y)\n$$\nThis displacement field correctly satisfies the Kirchhoff-Love hypothesis of zero transverse shear strain:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xz} = \\frac{1}{2}(u_{x,z} + u_{z,x}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(-z w_{,x}) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(w)) = \\frac{1}{2}(-w_{,x} + w_{,x}) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{yz} = \\frac{1}{2}(u_{y,z} + u_{z,y}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(-z w_{,y}) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(w)) = \\frac{1}{2}(-w_{,y} + w_{,y}) = 0\n$$\nNow, we compute the in-plane strain components using the small-strain definition $\\varepsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}(u_{i,j} + u_{j,i})$.\nThe normal strain in the $x$-direction is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xx} = u_{x,x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-z w_{,x}) = -z w_{,xx}\n$$\nThe normal strain in the $y$-direction is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{yy} = u_{y,y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(-z w_{,y}) = -z w_{,yy}\n$$\nThe tensor shear strain in the $x\\text{-}y$ plane is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xy} = \\frac{1}{2}(u_{x,y} + u_{y,x}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(-z w_{,x}) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-z w_{,y})\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(-z w_{,xy} - z w_{,yx})\n$$\nAssuming the displacement function $w(x,y)$ is sufficiently smooth, the order of differentiation does not matter ($w_{,xy} = w_{,yx}$), so:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xy} = -z w_{,xy}\n$$\nThe problem requires the engineering shear strain, $\\gamma_{xy}$, which is defined as $\\gamma_{xy} = 2 \\varepsilon_{xy}$.\n$$\n\\gamma_{xy} = -2z w_{,xy}\n$$\nSubstituting the given definitions for curvature components, $\\kappa_x = w_{,xx}$, $\\kappa_y = w_{,yy}$, and $\\kappa_{xy} = w_{,xy}$, we obtain the final expressions for the strains as a function of the thickness coordinate $z$ and the midsurface curvatures:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xx}(z) = -z \\kappa_x\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{yy}(z) = -z \\kappa_y\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma_{xy}(z) = -2z \\kappa_{xy}\n$$\nThese results demonstrate a linear variation of in-plane strains through the thickness, which is a classical result of Kirchhoff-Love plate theory.\n\nFinally, we must verify that the membrane strains vanish at the midsurface, $z=0$.

The scenario described is a standard benchmark known as the pure bending patch test, used to assess element quality, particularly regarding shear locking. The definitions and equations provided are standard and correct. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained. No scientific or logical flaws are detected. The problem is deemed valid and a solution will be furnished.\n\nTask 1: Computation of the ratio $r = \\frac{U_{s}^{\\text{ANS}}}{U_{s}^{\\text{std}}}$.\n\nFirst, we consider the shear energy computed with the Assumed Natural Strain (ANS) formulation, $U_{s}^{\\text{ANS}}$. The problem explicitly states that the ANS reconstruction yields $\\gamma_{xz}^{\\text{ANS}}=0$ and $\\gamma_{yz}^{\\text{ANS}}=0$ pointwise over the entire element. Substituting these into the shear strain energy expression gives:\n$$\nU_{s}^{\\text{ANS}} = \\frac{k_{s}Gt}{2}\\int_{A}\\left((0)^{2}+(0)^{2}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}A = 0\n$$\nThis result is a direct consequence of the problem statement, which reflects the fact that the ANS element is designed to pass this pure bending patch test and thus produces zero shear strain energy.\n\nNext, we compute the shear energy for the standard isoparametric formulation, $U_{s}^{\\text{std}}$. This requires calculating the interpolated fields and their derivatives. The four nodes of the element in the physical domain $(x,y)$ are $(0,0)$, $(a,0)$, $(a,a)$, and $(0,a)$, which correspond to parent coordinates $(\\xi,\\eta)$ of $(-1,-1)$, $(1,-1)$, $(1,1)$, and $(-1,1)$, respectively.\n\nThe nodal values of the degrees of freedom are obtained by evaluating the exact fields at the nodes:\n- Node 1: $(x,y)=(0,0) \\implies w_1=0, \\beta_{x,1}=0, \\beta_{y,1}=0$.\n- Node 2: $(x,y)=(a,0) \\implies w_2=\\frac{1}{2}\\kappa a^2, \\beta_{x,2}=-\\kappa a, \\beta_{y,2}=0$.\n- Node 3: $(x,y)=(a,a) \\implies w_3=\\frac{1}{2}\\kappa a^2, \\beta_{x,3}=-\\kappa a, \\beta_{y,3}=0$.\n- Node 4: $(x,y)=(0,a) \\implies w_4=0, \\beta_{x,4}=0, \\beta_{y,4}=0$.\n\nThe bilinear shape functions are $N_{i}(\\xi,\\eta) = \\frac{1}{4}(1+\\xi_{i}\\xi)(1+\\eta_{i}\\eta)$. The interpolated fields are:\n$$\nw_{h}(\\xi,\\eta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} N_{i}w_{i} = N_{2}w_{2} + N_{3}w_{3} = \\frac{1}{4}(1+\\xi)(1-\\eta)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\kappa a^{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{4}(1+\\xi)(1+\\eta)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\kappa a^{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\\kappa a^{2}(1+\\xi)\n$$\n$$\n\\beta_{x,h}(\\xi,\\eta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} N_{i}\\beta_{x,i} = N_{2}\\beta_{x,2} + N_{3}\\beta_{x,3} = \\frac{1}{4}(1+\\xi)(1-\\eta)(-\\kappa a) + \\frac{1}{4}(1+\\xi)(1+\\eta)(-\\kappa a) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\kappa a(1+\\xi)\n$$\n$$\n\\beta_{y,h}(\\xi,\\eta) = 0\n$$\nTo find the physical derivatives, we need the Jacobian of the mapping $x(\\xi,\\eta), y(\\xi,\\eta)$. The Jacobian matrix is $\\mathbf{J} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial x/\\partial\\xi & \\partial y/\\partial\\xi \\\\ \\partial x/\\partial\\eta & \\partial y/\\partial\\eta \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & a/2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The chain rule gives $\\begin{pmatrix} \\partial/\\partial x \\\\ \\partial/\\partial y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{J}^{-1} \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial/\\partial\\xi \\\\ \\partial/\\partial\\eta \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2/a & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2/a \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial/\\partial\\xi \\\\ \\partial/\\partial\\eta \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe derivative of the interpolated displacement is:\n$$\nw_{h,x} = \\frac{\\partial w_{h}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{2}{a} \\frac{\\partial w_{h}}{\\partial \\xi} = \\frac{2}{a} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\xi}\\left[\\frac{1}{4}\\kappa a^{2}(1+\\xi)\\right] = \\frac{2}{a}\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\kappa a^{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa a\n$$\nThe standard isoparametric shear strains are then:\n$$\n\\gamma_{xz}^{\\text{std}} = \\beta_{x,h} + w_{h,x} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\kappa a(1+\\xi) + \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa a = -\\frac{1}{2}\\kappa a \\xi\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma_{yz}^{\\text{std}} = \\beta_{y,h} + w_{h,y} = 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\nThe exact solution corresponds to a state of zero transverse shear strain: $\\gamma_{xz}^{\\text{exact}} = \\beta_x + w_{,x} = -\\kappa x + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\frac{1}{2}\\kappa x^2) = -\\kappa x + \\kappa x = 0$. The standard element formulation incorrectly produces a spurious, non-zero shear strain $\\gamma_{xz}^{\\text{std}}$, a phenomenon known as shear locking.\n\nThe shear strain energy $U_{s}^{\\text{std}}$ is found by integrating over the element area $A$. We transform the integral to the parent domain, where $\\mathrm{d}A = \\det(\\mathbf{J})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\xi\\,\\mathrm{d}\\eta = \\frac{a^{2}}{4}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\xi\\,\\mathrm{d}\\eta$.\n$$\nU_{s}^{\\text{std}} = \\frac{k_{s}Gt}{2}\\int_{-1}^{1}\\int_{-1}^{1} \\left( \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\kappa a \\xi\\right)^{2} + 0^{2} \\right) \\frac{a^{2}}{4}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\xi\\,\\mathrm{d}\\eta\n$$\n$$\nU_{s}^{\\text{std}} = \\frac{k_{s}Gt}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\kappa^{2}a^{2}}{4}\\right) \\left(\\frac{a^{2}}{4}\\right) \\int_{-1}^{1}\\int_{-1}^{1} \\xi^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\xi\\,\\mathrm{d}\\eta\n$$\nThe integral evaluates to $\\int_{-1}^{1}\\int_{-1}^{1} \\xi^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\xi\\,\\mathrm{d}\\eta = \\left[\\frac{\\xi^{3}}{3}\\right]_{-1}^{1} \\left[\\eta\\right]_{-1}^{1} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)(2) = \\frac{4}{3}$.\n$$\nU_{s}^{\\text{std}} = \\frac{k_{s}Gt \\kappa^{2} a^{4}}{32} \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{24}k_{s}Gt \\kappa^{2} a^{4}\n$$\nSince $U_{s}^{\\text{std}} \\neq 0$, the ratio $r$ is well-defined.\n$$\nr = \\frac{U_{s}^{\\text{ANS}}}{U_{s}^{\\text{std}}} = \\frac{0}{\\frac{1}{24}k_{s}Gt \\kappa^{2} a^{4}} = 0\n$$\n\nTask 2: Determination of the convergence rate exponent $p$.\n\nThe convergence rate of a finite element method is fundamentally limited by the polynomial completeness of its shape functions. For a sufficiently smooth exact solution, approximation theory states that the error in the energy norm, $\\|u-u_h\\|_a$, converges at a rate of $O(h^{k})$, where $h$ is the characteristic element size and $k$ is the highest degree of a complete polynomial that can be represented exactly by the element's shape functions. The energy error itself, $\\|u-u_h\\|_{a}^{2}$, would then converge at a rate of $O(h^{2k})$. The problem asks for the exponent $p$ in the scaling law $C h^{p}$, which conventionally refers to the convergence of the energy norm, not its square. Thus, we expect $p=k$.\n\nThe element in question uses bilinear isoparametric interpolation. The shape functions can exactly represent any polynomial of the form $c_0 + c_1 \\xi + c_2 \\eta + c_3 \\xi\\eta$. Since this basis contains the complete set of linear polynomials in $\\xi$ and $\\eta$ (i.e., $\\{1, \\xi, \\eta\\}$), and the mapping to physical coordinates is linear, the element can exactly represent any linear displacement and rotation field. The polynomial completeness of the element is therefore $k=1$.\n\nConsequently, the optimal convergence rate in the energy norm for this element is $p=k=1$.\n\nIn the context of thin Reissner-Mindlin plates, a standard bilinear element suffers from shear locking. This computational pathology artificially stiffens the element and prevents it from achieving the optimal convergence rate of $p=1$. The error does not diminish appropriately with mesh refinement.\n\nThe Assumed Natural Strain (ANS) formulation is specifically designed to eliminate shear locking. As demonstrated in Task 1, an ANS element correctly reproduces the zero-shear state in pure bending. By circumventing shear locking, the ANS formulation restores the convergence behavior to the optimal rate dictated by the element's underlying polynomial approximation capability.\n\nTherefore, for a uniform mesh of ANS elements under smooth bending, the total discrete energy error will converge at the rate determined by the bilinear shape functions. The expected value of the rate exponent is $p=1$.\n\nThe final results are $r=0$ and $p=1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2596070"}]}
