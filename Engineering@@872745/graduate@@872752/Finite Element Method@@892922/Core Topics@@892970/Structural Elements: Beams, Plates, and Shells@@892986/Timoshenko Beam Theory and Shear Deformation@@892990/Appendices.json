All principles are fundamental to solid mechanics.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a system of differential equations and a sufficient number of boundary conditions ($4$ conditions for a system that can be reduced to a fourth-order ODE) to determine a unique solution for the two unknowns, $w(x)$ and $\\phi(x)$.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, standard terminology from engineering and mathematics.\n- **Conclusion:** The problem is scientifically sound, self-contained, consistent, and well-posed. It is deemed **valid**.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows. First, we establish the governing equations from first principles as required.\n\nSign Conventions:\n- $x$ is the axial coordinate from the left support, $0 \\le x \\le L$.\n- $w$ is the transverse deflection, positive downwards.\n- $\\phi$ is the rotation of the cross-section, positive counterclockwise.\n- $q_0$ is the magnitude of the downward distributed load.\n- $V$ is the shear force, positive when it causes a clockwise rotation of the beam element (downward on the right face, upward on the left face).\n- $M$ is the bending moment, positive when it causes sagging (tension on the bottom fiber, compression on the top).\n\n1.  Equilibrium Equations\n    Balance of forces on a differential element of length $dx$ yields $\\frac{dV}{dx} = -q_0$.\n    Balance of moments yields $\\frac{dM}{dx} = V$.\n    Combining these two equations, we obtain $\\frac{d^2M}{dx^2} = -q_0$.\n\n2.  Constitutive and Kinematic Relations\n    - The bending moment $M$ is related to the curvature $\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$. For our sign conventions (positive sagging moment $M$, positive counterclockwise rotation $\\phi$), a positive moment causes the beam to sag, meaning $\\phi$ decreases as $x$ increases. Therefore, $\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$ is negative, and the constitutive relation is $M = -EI \\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$.\n    - The shear force $V$ is related to the shear strain $\\gamma$ by $V = \\kappa A G \\gamma$, where $\\kappa$ is the shear correction factor.\n    - The Timoshenko kinematic relation connects the slope of the deflection curve $\\frac{dw}{dx}$, the cross-section rotation $\\phi$, and the shear strain $\\gamma$. For our sign conventions, the shear strain is the difference between the slope of the deflection curve and the rotation of the cross-section: $\\gamma = \\frac{dw}{dx} - \\phi$.\n    - Substituting $\\gamma$ into the shear force relation gives $V = \\kappa A G (\\frac{dw}{dx} - \\phi)$.\n\n3.  Derivation of Shear Force $V(x)$ and Bending Moment $M(x)$\n    We first solve for $V(x)$ and $M(x)$ using the equilibrium equations and boundary conditions.\n    Integrating $\\frac{dV}{dx} = -q_0$ gives:\n    $V(x) = -q_0 x + C_1$\n    Integrating $\\frac{dM}{dx} = V$ gives:\n    $M(x) = \\int (-q_0 x + C_1) dx = -\\frac{q_0 x^2}{2} + C_1 x + C_2$\n    Now, we apply the boundary conditions for the bending moment.\n    $M(0) = 0 \\implies -\\frac{q_0 (0)^2}{2} + C_1(0) + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = 0$.\n    $M(L) = 0 \\implies -\\frac{q_0 L^2}{2} + C_1 L = 0 \\implies C_1 = \\frac{q_0 L}{2}$.\n    Thus, the shear force and bending moment are:\n    $V(x) = q_0(\\frac{L}{2} - x)$\n    $M(x) = \\frac{q_0 L x}{2} - \\frac{q_0 x^2}{2} = \\frac{q_0 x}{2}(L - x)$\n\n4.  Derivation of Cross-Section Rotation $\\phi(x)$\n    We use the constitutive relation $M = -EI \\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$:\n    $\\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = -\\frac{M(x)}{EI} = -\\frac{1}{EI} \\left( \\frac{q_0 L x}{2} - \\frac{q_0 x^2}{2} \\right) = \\frac{q_0}{2EI} (x^2 - Lx)$\n    Integrating with respect to $x$:\n    $\\phi(x) = \\int \\frac{q_0}{2EI} (x^2 - Lx) dx = \\frac{q_0}{2EI} \\left( \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{Lx^2}{2} \\right) + C_3$\n    Due to the symmetry of the loading and boundary conditions, the cross-section rotation must be zero at the mid-span, $x = L/2$. So, $\\phi(L/2) = 0$.\n    $\\phi(L/2) = \\frac{q_0}{2EI} \\left( \\frac{(L/2)^3}{3} - \\frac{L(L/2)^2}{2} \\right) + C_3 = \\frac{q_0}{2EI} \\left( \\frac{L^3}{24} - \\frac{L^3}{8} \\right) + C_3 = 0$\n    $\\frac{q_0}{2EI} \\left( \\frac{L^3 - 3L^3}{24} \\right) + C_3 = \\frac{q_0}{2EI} \\left( -\\frac{2L^3}{24} \\right) + C_3 = -\\frac{q_0 L^3}{24EI} + C_3 = 0$\n    This gives the integration constant $C_3 = \\frac{q_0 L^3}{24EI}$.\n    Substituting $C_3$ back into the expression for $\\phi(x)$:\n    $\\phi(x) = \\frac{q_0}{2EI} \\left( \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{Lx^2}{2} \\right) + \\frac{q_0 L^3}{24EI} = \\frac{q_0}{24EI} \\left( 4x^3 - 6Lx^2 + L^3 \\right)$\n\n5.

Consequently, differentiation with respect to $x$ is related to differentiation with respect to $\\xi$ by the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} = \\frac{d\\xi}{dx}\\frac{d}{d\\xi} = \\frac{1}{J}\\frac{d}{d\\xi} = \\frac{2}{L}\\frac{d}{d\\xi}\n$$\n\n**a) Derivation of the shear strain field $\\gamma(\\xi)$**\n\nThe shear strain is defined as $\\gamma(x) = w'(x) - \\phi(x)$, where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to $x$. First, we compute $w'(x)$:\n$$\nw'(x) = \\frac{dw}{dx} = \\frac{2}{L}\\frac{dw}{d\\xi}\n$$\nThe derivative of the displacement field with respect to $\\xi$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dw}{d\\xi} = \\frac{d}{d\\xi}\\left(\\frac{1-\\xi}{2}w_{1} + \\frac{1+\\xi}{2}w_{2}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2}w_{1} + \\frac{1}{2}w_{2} = \\frac{w_{2}-w_{1}}{2}\n$$\nTherefore, the slope $w'(x)$ is constant throughout the element:\n$$\nw'(x) = \\frac{2}{L}\\left(\\frac{w_{2}-w_{1}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{w_{2}-w_{1}}{L}\n$$\nNow, substitute this and the interpolated rotation $\\phi(\\xi)$ into the expression for shear strain:\n$$\n\\gamma(\\xi) = \\frac{w_{2}-w_{1}}{L} - \\left(\\frac{1-\\xi}{2}\\phi_{1} + \\frac{1+\\xi}{2}\\phi_{2}\\right)\n$$\nTo express this in the affine form $\\gamma(\\xi) = \\gamma_{0} + \\gamma_{1}\\xi$, we group the constant and linear terms in $\\xi$:\n$$\n\\gamma(\\xi) = \\left(\\frac{w_{2}-w_{1}}{L} - \\frac{\\phi_{1}+\\phi_{2}}{2}\\right) + \\xi\\left(\\frac{\\phi_{1}-\\phi_{2}}{2}\\right)\n$$\nBy comparing this with the required form, we identify the coefficients $\\gamma_{0}$ and $\\gamma_{1}$:\n$$\n\\gamma_{0} = \\frac{w_{2}-w_{1}}{L} - \\frac{\\phi_{1}+\\phi_{2}}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma_{1} = \\frac{\\phi_{1}-\\phi_{2}}{2}\n$$\n\n**b) Exact shear energy and determination of $c$**\n\nThe shear contribution to the strain energy is given by:\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{shear}}^{\\mathrm{exact}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{L} \\kappa G A \\, (\\gamma(x))^{2} \\,dx\n$$\nWe change the integration variable from $x$ to $\\xi$. The differential element becomes $dx = \\frac{L}{2}d\\xi$, and the integration limits change from $[0,L]$ to $[-1,1]$.\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{shear}}^{\\mathrm{exact}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{-1}^{1} \\kappa G A \\, (\\gamma(\\xi))^{2} \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) d\\xi = \\frac{1}{4} \\kappa G A L \\int_{-1}^{1} (\\gamma_{0} + \\gamma_{1}\\xi)^{2} d\\xi\n$$\nWe expand the integrand and integrate term-by-term:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} (\\gamma_{0}^{2} + 2\\gamma_{0}\\gamma_{1}\\xi + \\gamma_{1}^{2}\\xi^{2}) d\\xi = \\left[\\gamma_{0}^{2}\\xi + \\gamma_{0}\\gamma_{1}\\xi^{2} + \\frac{\\gamma_{1}^{2}\\xi^{3}}{3}\\right]_{-1}^{1}\n$$\nEvaluating the definite integral:\n$$\n= (\\gamma_{0}^{2}(1) + \\gamma_{0}\\gamma_{1}(1)^{2} + \\frac{\\gamma_{1}^{2}(1)^{3}}{3}) - (\\gamma_{0}^{2}(-1) + \\gamma_{0}\\gamma_{1}(-1)^{2} + \\frac{\\gamma_{1}^{2}(-1)^{3}}{3})\n$$\n$$\n= (\\gamma_{0}^{2} + \\gamma_{0}\\gamma_{1} + \\frac{\\gamma_{1}^{2}}{3}) - (-\\gamma_{0}^{2} + \\gamma_{0}\\gamma_{1} - \\frac{\\gamma_{1}^{2}}{3}) = 2\\gamma_{0}^{2} + \\frac{2}{3}\\gamma_{1}^{2}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the energy expression:\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{shear}}^{\\mathrm{exact}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\kappa G A L \\left(2\\gamma_{0}^{2} + \\frac{2}{3}\\gamma_{1}^{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\kappa G A L \\left(\\gamma_{0}^{2} + \\frac{1}{3}\\gamma_{1}^{2}\\right)\n$$\nComparing this with the given form $U_{\\mathrm{shear}}^{\\mathrm{exact}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\kappa G A \\, L \\left(\\gamma_{0}^{2} + c\\,\\gamma_{1}^{2}\\right)$, we conclude that the constant $c$ is:\n$$\nc = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\n\n**c) Reduced integration shear energy and its consequences**\n\nOne-point Gauss quadrature approximates an integral over $[-1,1]$ as $\\int_{-1}^{1} f(\\xi) d\\xi \\approx 2f(0)$. Applying this to the shear energy integral:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} \\kappa G A \\, (\\gamma(\\xi))^{2} \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) d\\xi \\approx 2 \\cdot \\left[ \\kappa G A \\, (\\gamma(0))^{2} \\frac{L}{2} \\right]\n$$\nThe shear strain at the quadrature point $\\xi=0$ is $\\gamma(0) = \\gamma_{0} + \\gamma_{1}(0) = \\gamma_{0}$.\nThe reduced-integration shear energy $U_{\\mathrm{shear}}^{\\mathrm{RI}}$ is therefore:\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{shear}}^{\\mathrm{RI}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( 2 \\cdot \\kappa G A \\gamma_{0}^{2} \\frac{L}{2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\kappa G A L \\gamma_{0}^{2}\n$$\nThis confirms the provided expression.\n\n**Explanation:**\nShear locking in slender beams arises because linear interpolations for $w$ and $\\phi$ cannot represent a constant-curvature bending state (where $w$ is cubic and $\\phi$ is quadratic) without inducing a parasitic, non-zero shear strain. Full integration penalizes both the constant ($\\gamma_{0}$) and linear ($\\gamma_{1}$) components of this parasitic shear strain. In the slender limit, the true shear strain should be nearly zero, but the element kinematics impose a non-zero strain, resulting in an artificially high shear energy and an overly stiff response. Reduced integration evaluates the shear energy only at the element center ($\\xi=0$). This procedure correctly penalizes the constant part of the shear strain, $\\gamma_0$, but completely ignores the linear part, $\\gamma_1$, as its contribution to the energy becomes $\\frac{1}{2}\\kappa G A L (0)^2 = 0$. This relaxation of the shear constraint allows the element to bend more freely without a large energy penalty, thus eliminating shear locking.\n\nHowever, this introduces a problem. Any deformation mode for which $\\gamma_{0}=0$ but $\\gamma_{1}\\neq 0$ will yield zero shear strain energy under reduced integration ($U_{\\mathrm{shear}}^{\\mathrm{RI}}=0$). Such a deformation is not a rigid-body motion and should possess strain energy. For example, a state where $w_1 = w_2 = 0$ and $\\phi_1 = -\\phi_2 \\neq 0$ gives $\\gamma_0 = 0$ and $\\gamma_1 = \\phi_1 \\neq 0$. This is a spurious \"hourglass\" or \"zero-energy\" mode, which can lead to uncontrollable oscillations in a finite element mesh.\n\n**d) Derivation of the stabilization coefficient $\\beta$**\n\nThe objective is to find $\\beta$ such that the stabilized reduced-integration energy equals the exact, fully integrated energy for any linear shear strain field.\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{shear}}^{\\mathrm{RI}} + U_{\\mathrm{stab}} = U_{\\mathrm{shear}}^{\\mathrm{exact}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived previously:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\kappa G A L \\gamma_{0}^{2} + U_{\\mathrm{stab}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa G A L \\left(\\gamma_{0}^{2} + \\frac{1}{3}\\gamma_{1}^{2}\\right)\n$$\nThis requires that the stabilization energy exactly match the energy of the linear shear strain component that was lost due to reduced integration:\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{stab}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa G A L \\frac{1}{3}\\gamma_{1}^{2}\n$$\nNow we evaluate the expression for $U_{\\mathrm{stab}}$ provided in the problem statement:\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{stab}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta \\int_{0}^{L}\\left(\\frac{d\\gamma}{dx}\\right)^{2} dx\n$$\nThe derivative of the shear strain with respect to the physical coordinate $x$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\gamma}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}(\\gamma_{0} + \\gamma_{1}\\xi) = \\gamma_{1}\\frac{d\\xi}{dx} = \\gamma_{1}\\left(\\frac{2}{L}\\right)\n$$\nSince this derivative is constant over the element, the integral is straightforward:\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{stab}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta \\int_{0}^{L} \\left(\\frac{2\\gamma_{1}}{L}\\right)^{2} dx = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta \\left(\\frac{4\\gamma_{1}^{2}}{L^{2}}\\right) \\int_{0}^{L}dx = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta \\left(\\frac{4\\gamma_{1}^{2}}{L^{2}}\\right) L = \\frac{2\\beta\\gamma_{1}^{2}}{L}\n$$\nFinally, we equate the two expressions for $U_{\\mathrm{stab}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{2\\beta\\gamma_{1}^{2}}{L} = \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa G A L \\frac{1}{3}\\gamma_{1}^{2}\n$$\nFor a non-trivial shear mode ($\\gamma_{1} \\neq 0$), we can cancel $\\gamma_{1}^{2}$ from both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{2\\beta}{L} = \\frac{1}{6}\\kappa G A L\n$$\nSolving for the stabilization coefficient $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{1}{6}\\kappa G A L \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{12}\\kappa G A L^{2}\n$$\nThis choice of $\\beta$ ensures that the hourglass stabilization term precisely restores the energy associated with the linear part of the shear strain field, thus combining the locking-free behavior of reduced integration with the stability of full integration.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{12} \\kappa G A L^{2}}\n$$", "id": "2606097"}]}
