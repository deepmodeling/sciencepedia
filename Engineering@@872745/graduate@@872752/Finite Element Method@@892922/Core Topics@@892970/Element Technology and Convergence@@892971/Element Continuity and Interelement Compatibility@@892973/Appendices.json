Consider approximating a scalar field $u(\\xi,\\eta)$ by a bicubic polynomial on $\\Omega_{e}$ that is suitable for use in the Finite Element Method (FEM). The target is to construct a two-dimensional cubic Hermite element that enforces continuity of first derivatives (denoted $C^{1}$ continuity) across interelement boundaries on a mesh of axis-aligned rectangles.\n\nStarting from the core definition that $C^{1}$ interelement compatibility requires the trace of $u$ and its first derivatives to be continuous across any common edge, proceed as follows:\n\n1) In one dimension on the interval $[-1,1]$, derive four cubic polynomials $H_{1}(\\xi)$, $H_{2}(\\xi)$, $H_{3}(\\xi)$, $H_{4}(\\xi)$ that serve as the Hermite basis associated with nodal data at the endpoints $\\xi=-1$ and $\\xi=1$. Specifically, require that each $H_{i}$ satisfies the interpolation conditions that ensure exact reproduction of the nodal value and nodal first derivative at its associated endpoint and vanishing of the same quantities at the opposite endpoint. Concretely, for the endpoint at $\\xi=-1$, enforce $H_{1}(-1)=1$, $H_{1}'(-1)=0$, $H_{1}(1)=0$, $H_{1}'(1)=0$ and $H_{2}(-1)=0$, $H_{2}'(-1)=1$, $H_{2}(1)=0$, $H_{2}'(1)=0$. For the endpoint at $\\xi=1$, enforce $H_{3}(-1)=0$, $H_{3}'(-1)=0$, $H_{3}(1)=1$, $H_{3}'(1)=0$ and $H_{4}(-1)=0$, $H_{4}'(-1)=0$, $H_{4}(1)=0$, $H_{4}'(1)=1$.\n\n2) Using the tensor-product construction on $\\Omega_{e}$, build the bicubic Hermite shape functions for the $16$ nodal quantities located at the four corners $(\\xi,\\eta) \\in \\{(-1,-1),(1,-1),(1,1),(-1,1)\\}$, where at each corner the degrees of freedom are $\\{u, u_{,\\xi}, u_{,\\eta}, u_{,\\xi\\eta}\\}$.

Provide this value as your final answer. No rounding is required; give the exact value.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It is a standard problem in the theory of the Finite Element Method. We proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the one-dimensional cubic Hermite basis functions on the interval $\\xi \\in [-1,1]$. A general cubic polynomial may be written as $p(\\xi) = a\\xi^3 + b\\xi^2 + c\\xi + d$, with its derivative being $p'(\\xi) = 3a\\xi^2 + 2b\\xi + c$. We must find four such polynomials, $H_1(\\xi)$, $H_2(\\xi)$, $H_3(\\xi)$, and $H_4(\\xi)$, each satisfying a set of four given interpolation conditions.\n\nFor $H_1(\\xi)$, the conditions are $H_1(-1)=1$, $H_1'(-1)=0$, $H_1(1)=0$, and $H_1'(1)=0$. These lead to the following system of linear equations for the coefficients $(a,b,c,d)$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n-a + b - c + d = 1 \\\\\na + b + c + d = 0 \\\\\n3a - 2b + c = 0 \\\\\n3a + 2b + c = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFrom the last two equations, subtracting one from the other yields $4b=0$, so $b=0$. Adding them gives $6a+2c=0$, so $c=-3a$. Substituting $b=0$ and $c=-3a$ into the first two equations gives $-a+3a+d=1$ (i.e., $2a+d=1$) and $a-3a+d=0$ (i.e., $-2a+d=0$). From the second of these, $d=2a$. Substituting this into the first gives $2a+2a=1$, so $a=1/4$. Consequently, $d=1/2$, $c=-3/4$, and $b=0$. The polynomial is:\n$$H_1(\\xi) = \\frac{1}{4}\\xi^3 - \\frac{3}{4}\\xi + \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nFor $H_2(\\xi)$, the conditions are $H_2(-1)=0$, $H_2'(-1)=1$, $H_2(1)=0$, and $H_2'(1)=0$. The system is:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n-a + b - c + d = 0 \\\\\na + b + c + d = 0 \\\\\n3a - 2b + c = 1 \\\\\n3a + 2b + c = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe first two equations imply $b+d=0$ and $a+c=0$, so $d=-b$ and $c=-a$. The last two equations give $6a+2c=1$ and $-4b=1$. From $-4b=1$, we have $b=-1/4$, so $d=1/4$. From $6a+2c=1$ and $c=-a$, we have $6a-2a=1$, which gives $a=1/4$. Thus, $c=-1/4$. The polynomial is:\n$$H_2(\\xi) = \\frac{1}{4}\\xi^3 - \\frac{1}{4}\\xi^2 - \\frac{1}{4}\\xi + \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nThe functions $H_3(\\xi)$ and $H_4(\\xi)$ can be found by symmetry. $H_3(\\xi)$ must satisfy $H_3(-1)=0$, $H_3'(-1)=0$, $H_3(1)=1$, $H_3'(1)=0$. These are the same conditions that $H_1(-\\xi)$ satisfies. Therefore, $H_3(\\xi) = H_1(-\\xi)$:\n$$H_3(\\xi) = \\frac{1}{4}(-\\xi)^3 - \\frac{3}{4}(-\\xi) + \\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{1}{4}\\xi^3 + \\frac{3}{4}\\xi + \\frac{1}{2}$$\nSimilarly, $H_4(\\xi)$ must satisfy $H_4(-1)=0$, $H_4'(-1)=0$, $H_4(1)=0$, $H_4'(1)=1$. These conditions are satisfied by $-H_2(-\\xi)$. Therefore, $H_4(\\xi) = -H_2(-\\xi)$:\n$$H_4(\\xi) = - \\left( \\frac{1}{4}(-\\xi)^3 - \\frac{1}{4}(-\\xi)^2 - \\frac{1}{4}(-\\xi) + \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\\xi^3 + \\frac{1}{4}\\xi^2 - \\frac{1}{4}\\xi - \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nNext, we construct the bicubic Hermite shape functions on the reference square $\\Omega_e$ using a tensor-product construction. The $16$ degrees of freedom (DOFs) are the values of the function $u$, its first derivatives $u_{,\\xi}$ and $u_{,\\eta}$, and its mixed derivative $u_{,\\xi\\eta}$ at the four corners $(\\xi_i, \\eta_j)$ where $\\xi_i, \\eta_j \\in \\{-1,1\\}$. The approximation $u_h(\\xi, \\eta)$ is a linear combination of $16$ shape functions, each multiplying a nodal DOF. A shape function $N(\\xi,\\eta)$ is a product of a one-dimensional basis function in $\\xi$ and one in $\\eta$. Let's distinguish between basis functions for function values, which we call \"value\" functions ($H_1, H_3$), and those for derivative values, \"derivative\" functions ($H_2, H_4$). The shape function for a particular DOF is constructed by choosing the 1D function in each variable that corresponds to that DOF type. For example, the shape function for the DOF $u_{,\\xi}$ at a corner involves a \"derivative\" function in $\\xi$ and a \"value\" function in $\\eta$. At a corner with coordinates $(\\xi_i, \\eta_j)$, the four shape functions are:\n-   For $u$: $N^u(\\xi,\\eta) = H_{val}(\\xi, \\xi_i) H_{val}(\\eta, \\eta_j)$\n-   For $u_{,\\xi}$: $N^{u_\\xi}(\\xi,\\eta) = H_{der}(\\xi, \\xi_i) H_{val}(\\eta, \\eta_j)$\n-   For $u_{,\\eta}$: $N^{u_\\eta}(\\xi,\\eta) = H_{val}(\\xi, \\xi_i) H_{der}(\\eta, \\eta_j)$\n-   For $u_{,\\xi\\eta}$: $N^{u_{\\xi\\eta}}(\\xi,\\eta) = H_{der}(\\xi, \\xi_i) H_{der}(\\eta, \\eta_j)$\nwhere $H_{val}(\\cdot, -1)=H_1$, $H_{der}(\\cdot, -1)=H_2$, $H_{val}(\\cdot, 1)=H_3$, and $H_{der}(\\cdot, 1)=H_4$.\n\nWe now justify $C^1$ continuity across interelement boundaries. Consider an edge shared by two elements, for instance, the edge at $\\xi=1$ for element A and $\\xi=-1$ for element B.\nContinuity of the function, $u$, requires that the trace of $u_h(\\xi,\\eta)$ along the edge is uniquely defined by the DOFs on that edge. Let's examine the trace of $u_h$ along $\\xi=1$:\n$u_h(1,\\eta)$. The full expansion is a sum over all $16$ DOFs. However, by construction, $H_1(1)=0$, $H_2(1)=0$, $H_1'(1)=0$, and $H_2'(1)=0$. This means any shape function associated with a node at $\\xi=-1$ is zero along the line $\\xi=1$. The trace $u_h(1,\\eta)$ is thus determined only by the DOFs at the nodes on that edge, namely at $(1,-1)$ and $(1,1)$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$ u_h(1, \\eta) = u(1,-1)H_3(1)H_1(\\eta) + u_{,\\eta}(1,-1)H_3(1)H_2(\\eta) + u(1,1)H_3(1)H_3(\\eta) + u_{,\\eta}(1,1)H_3(1)H_4(\\eta) $$\nSince $H_3(1)=1$, this becomes:\n$$ u_h(1, \\eta) = u(1,-1)H_1(\\eta) + u_{,\\eta}(1,-1)H_2(\\eta) + u(1,1)H_3(\\eta) + u_{,\\eta}(1,1)H_4(\\eta) $$\nThis is a 1D cubic Hermite representation along the edge, completely defined by the four nodal DOFs $\\{u, u_{,\\eta}\\}$ at the two corner nodes of that edge.\nSimilarly, for element B, the trace $u_h(-1,\\eta)$ is determined by the DOFs $\\{u, u_{,\\eta}\\}$ on its edge at $\\xi=-1$. If two elements share these four DOFs at their common nodes, the function $u$ will be continuous across their boundary.\n\nContinuity of the first derivatives requires continuity of the normal derivative. For an axis-aligned rectangular mesh, the normal derivative across a vertical edge is, up to a scaling from the element Jacobian, $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\xi}$. We examine the trace of $\\frac{\\partial u_h}{\\partial \\xi}$ along $\\xi=1$. Differentiating the expansion for $u_h$ with respect to $\\xi$ and evaluating at $\\xi=1$ involves terms like $H_i'(1)$. By construction, $H_1'(1)=0, H_2'(1)=0, H_3'(1)=0$, but $H_4'(1)=1$. Thus, only terms involving $H_4'(\\xi)$ or originating from DOFs $u_{,\\xi}$ and $u_{,\\xi\\eta}$ at $\\xi=1$ survive. The trace is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u_h}{\\partial \\xi}(1,\\eta) = u_{,\\xi}(1,-1)H_4'(1)H_1(\\eta) + u_{,\\xi\\eta}(1,-1)H_4'(1)H_2(\\eta) + u_{,\\xi}(1,1)H_4'(1)H_3(\\eta) + u_{,\\xi\\eta}(1,1)H_4'(1)H_4(\\eta) $$\nSince $H_4'(1)=1$, this becomes:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u_h}{\\partial \\xi}(1, \\eta) = u_{,\\xi}(1,-1)H_1(\\eta) + u_{,\\xi\\eta}(1,-1)H_2(\\eta) + u_{,\\xi}(1,1)H_3(\\eta) + u_{,\\xi\\eta}(1,1)H_4(\\eta) $$\nThis trace is again a 1D cubic Hermite representation, determined by the four nodal DOFs $\\{u_{,\\xi}, u_{,\\xi\\eta}\\}$ at the corners of the edge. If these four DOFs are shared between adjacent elements, the normal derivative will be continuous.\nTherefore, to ensure $C^1$ continuity, all DOFs $\\{u, u_{,\\xi}, u_{,\\eta}, u_{,\\xi\\eta}\\}$ at the nodes on a common boundary must be shared. The tensor-product construction inherently satisfies this requirement because the behavior on any edge is governed exclusively by the DOFs residing on that edge.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the shape function corresponding to the nodal displacement $u$ at the corner $(\\xi, \\eta)=(1,1)$ at the point $(\\xi,\\eta)=(\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2})$. This shape function is $N(\\xi,\\eta) = H_3(\\xi)H_3(\\eta)$. We must compute $N(\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}) = H_3(\\frac{1}{2}) H_3(-\\frac{1}{2})$.\nWe use the expression $H_3(s) = -\\frac{1}{4}s^3 + \\frac{3}{4}s + \\frac{1}{2}$.\nFirst, for $s = \\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$ H_3\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 + \\frac{3}{4}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right) + \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{1}{32} + \\frac{12}{32} + \\frac{16}{32} = \\frac{27}{32} $$\nNext, for $s = -\\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$ H_3\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{4}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 + \\frac{3}{4}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{1}{4}\\left(-\\frac{1}{8}\\right) - \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{32} - \\frac{12}{32} + \\frac{16}{32} = \\frac{5}{32} $$\nThe value of the shape function is the product of these two values:\n$$ N\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{27}{32}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{5}{32}\\right) = \\frac{135}{1024} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{135}{1024}}$$", "id": "2553873"}, {"introduction": "To deepen your understanding, it is crucial to explore not just when continuity holds, but also when it can unexpectedly fail.

The shared edge is $E = \\{(s, 1-s) : s \\in [0,1]\\}$.\n\n**Task 1: Verification of $C^{0}$ and tangential derivative continuity along the edge $E$.**\n\nFirst, we verify $C^{0}$ continuity. A function is $C^{0}$ continuous across an edge if its values (traces) from both adjacent elements coincide along the entire edge. A point $(x,y)$ on the edge $E$ satisfies the linear equation $x+y-1=0$.\nThe trace of $p_{1}$ on $E$ is obtained by substituting $y=1-x$ (or more generally, recognizing $x+y-1=0$) into its expression:\n$$ u|_{T_{1}, E} = p_{1}(x,y)|_{x+y-1=0} = x(0) = 0 $$\nThe trace of $p_{2}$ on $E$ is similarly evaluated:\n$$ u|_{T_{2}, E} = p_{2}(x,y)|_{x+y-1=0} = y(0) = 0 $$\nSince both traces are identically zero along the edge $E$, we have $p_{1} = p_{2}$ on $E$. Therefore, the function $u$ is $C^{0}$ continuous across the interior of the edge $E$.\n\nNext, we verify the continuity of the tangential derivative, $\\partial_{t}u = \\nabla u \\cdot t$, where $t = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1,-1)$ is the unit tangent vector to $E$. We must first compute the gradients of $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$.\nFor $p_{1}(x,y) = x^{2} + xy - x$, the gradient is:\n$$ \\nabla p_{1}(x,y) = \\left( \\frac{\\partial p_{1}}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial p_{1}}{\\partial y} \\right) = (2x + y - 1, x) $$\nFor $p_{2}(x,y) = xy + y^{2} - y$, the gradient is:\n$$ \\nabla p_{2}(x,y) = \\left( \\frac{\\partial p_{2}}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial p_{2}}{\\partial y} \\right) = (y, x + 2y - 1) $$\nNow, we evaluate these gradients along the edge $E$, which can be parametrized by $(x,y) = (s, 1-s)$ for $s \\in [0,1]$.\nThe trace of the gradient $\\nabla p_{1}$ on $E$ is:\n$$ \\nabla p_{1}(s, 1-s) = (2s + (1-s) - 1, s) = (s, s) $$\nThe trace of the gradient $\\nabla p_{2}$ on $E$ is:\n$$ \\nabla p_{2}(s, 1-s) = (1-s, s + 2(1-s) - 1) = (1-s, s+2-2s-1) = (1-s, 1-s) $$\nNow we compute the tangential derivatives along the edge $E$ for $s \\in (0,1)$:\nFor $p_{1}$:\n$$ \\partial_{t} p_{1}|_{E} = \\nabla p_{1}(s, 1-s) \\cdot t = (s,s) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1,-1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(s \\cdot 1 + s \\cdot (-1)) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(s-s) = 0 $$\nFor $p_{2}$:\n$$ \\partial_{t} p_{2}|_{E} = \\nabla p_{2}(s, 1-s) \\cdot t = (1-s, 1-s) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1,-1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}((1-s) \\cdot 1 + (1-s) \\cdot (-1)) = 0 $$\nSince the tangential derivatives from both sides are identically zero along the interior of the edge $E$, $\\partial_{t} u$ is indeed continuous across $E$.\n\n**Task 2: Analysis of continuity at vertex $v = (1,0)$.**\n\nFor a function to be $C^{1}$ continuous in the domain $\\Omega$, its gradient must be continuous at every point in $\\Omega$. This requires that at any point on a shared boundary, the gradient must have a unique value, regardless of the direction of approach (i.e., from which element).

Since $\\nabla p_{1}(v) \\neq \\nabla p_{2}(v)$, the gradient of $u$ is not uniquely defined at the vertex $v$. Consequently, $u$ is not differentiable at $v$ and fails to be $C^{1}$ in any open neighborhood of $v$, and therefore is not $C^{1}$ on $\\Omega$.\n\nThe satisfaction of edgewise continuity for $u$ and its tangential derivative $\\partial_{t} u$ is a necessary but not sufficient condition for $C^{1}$ continuity at a vertex where elements meet. A vertex involves constraints from all adjoining elements, and ensuring continuity of the full gradient vector is a more restrictive condition than ensuring continuity of a single directional derivative along one edge.

The jump is defined as\n$$\nJ = v_{1}^{\\mathrm{iso}}(x_{\\ast}) \\cdot n_{E} - v_{2}^{\\mathrm{iso}}(x_{\\ast}) \\cdot n_{E}\n$$\nwhere $x_{\\ast} = \\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}$ is the evaluation point on the interface and $n_{E} = \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}$ is the fixed unit normal vector on $E$.\n\nThe vector fields on the physical elements $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ are obtained by transforming a reference vector field $\\hat{v}$ using the provided isoparametric mapping rule:\n$$\nv_{i}^{\\mathrm{iso}}(x) = A_{i} \\, \\hat{v}(\\hat{x}) \\quad \\text{for } x = F_{i}(\\hat{x})\n$$\nThe given reference vector field is constant:\n$$\n\\hat{v}(\\hat{x}) = \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince $\\hat{v}$ does not depend on the position $\\hat{x}$ within the reference element, the resulting physical vector fields $v_{i}^{\\mathrm{iso}}$ are also constant over their respective elements $T_{i}$. We can therefore evaluate them at any point, including $x_{\\ast}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the vector field $v_{1}^{\\mathrm{iso}}$ on element $T_{1}$ using the matrix $A_{1}$:\n$$\nv_{1}^{\\mathrm{iso}}(x_{\\ast}) = A_{1} \\hat{v} = \\begin{pmatrix}2  0 \\\\ 0  1\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (2)(0) + (0)(1) \\\\ (0)(0) + (1)(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe normal component of this vector at the interface is determined by the dot product with $n_{E}$:\n$$\nv_{1}^{\\mathrm{iso}}(x_{\\ast}) \\cdot n_{E} = \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix} = (0)(0) + (1)(1) = 1\n$$\nNext, we perform the same calculation for the vector field $v_{2}^{\\mathrm{iso}}$ on element $T_{2}$ using the matrix $A_{2}$:\n$$\nv_{2}^{\\mathrm{iso}}(x_{\\ast}) = A_{2} \\hat{v} = \\begin{pmatrix}2  2 \\\\ 0  -2\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (2)(0) + (2)(1) \\\\ (0)(0) + (-2)(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}2 \\\\ -2\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe normal component of this second vector at the interface is:\n$$\nv_{2}^{\\mathrm{iso}}(x_{\\ast}) \\cdot n_{E} = \\begin{pmatrix}2 \\\\ -2\\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix} = (2)(0) + (-2)(1) = -2\n$$\nFinally, we compute the jump $J$ by subtracting the second normal component from the first:\n$$\nJ = (v_{1}^{\\mathrm{iso}}(x_{\\ast}) \\cdot n_{E}) - (v_{2}^{\\mathrm{iso}}(x_{\\ast}) \\cdot n_{E}) = 1 - (-2) = 3\n$$\nThe non-zero result demonstrates that the simple isoparametric mapping fails to preserve the continuity of the normal flux, a condition required for $H(\\mathrm{div})$-conforming finite element methods. The correct transformation, the Piola map, would involve a scaling factor of $(\\det(A_i))^{-1}$, which ensures this continuity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3}\n$$", "id": "2553911"}]}
