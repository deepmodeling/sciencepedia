It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive the consistent mass matrix for a one-dimensional linear bar element using the Galerkin method. It is a standard problem in the study of the Finite Element Method. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe starting point is the strong form of the governing equation for one-dimensional elastodynamics, given as:\n$$ \\rho A \\,\\ddot{u}(x,t) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\!\\left(EA\\,\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(x,t)\\right) = A\\,b(x,t) $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the material density, $A$ is the cross-sectional area, $u(x,t)$ is the axial displacement, $E$ is Young's modulus, and $b(x,t)$ is the body force per unit volume. The double dot, $\\ddot{u}$, denotes the second partial derivative with respect to time, $t$.\n\nTo derive the weak form, we multiply the equation by an arbitrary weighting function, $w(x)$, and integrate over the domain of a single finite element, which spans from $x=0$ to $x=L$.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} w(x) \\left[ \\rho A \\,\\ddot{u}(x,t) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\!\\left(EA\\,\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\right) \\right] dx = \\int_{0}^{L} w(x) A\\,b(x,t) dx $$\nWe rearrange the terms and apply integration by parts to the term containing the second spatial derivative of $u$. This procedure reduces the continuity requirement on the displacement field $u(x,t)$.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} w(x) \\rho A \\ddot{u} \\,dx - \\int_{0}^{L} w(x) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\!\\left(EA\\,\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\right) dx = \\int_{0}^{L} w(x) A\\,b(x,t) dx $$\nThe second term on the left-hand side is integrated by parts:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} w(x) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\!\\left(EA\\,\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\right) dx = \\left[ w(x) EA \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\right]_{0}^{L} - \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} EA \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} dx $$\nSubstituting this back into the integrated equation gives the weak form for the element:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} w(x) \\rho A \\ddot{u} \\,dx + \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} EA \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} dx = \\int_{0}^{L} w(x) A\\,b(x,t) dx + \\left[ w(x) EA \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\right]_{0}^{L} $$\nThis equation must hold for any admissible weighting function $w(x)$. The term on the right-hand side represents the work done by the external forces, including body forces and nodal forces (boundary tractions).\n\nNext, we introduce the finite element approximation for the displacement field $u(x,t)$ over the element. For a $2$-node linear element, the displacement is interpolated from the nodal displacements $d_1(t)$ and $d_2(t)$ using linear shape functions $N_1(x)$ and $N_2(x)$:\n$$ u(x,t) \\approx u^h(x,t) = N_1(x)d_1(t) + N_2(x)d_2(t) = \\mathbf{N}(x)\\mathbf{d}(t) $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{N}(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} N_1(x) & N_2(x) \\end{pmatrix}$ is the matrix of shape functions and $\\mathbf{d}(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} d_1(t) \\\\ d_2(t) \\end{pmatrix}$ is the vector of nodal displacements. The shape functions are given as $N_1(x) = 1 - \\frac{x}{L}$ and $N_2(x) = \\frac{x}{L}$.\n\nThe required derivatives are:\n$$ \\ddot{u}(x,t) \\approx \\mathbf{N}(x)\\ddot{\\mathbf{d}}(t) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(x,t) \\approx \\frac{d\\mathbf{N}}{dx}\\mathbf{d}(t) = \\mathbf{B}(x)\\mathbf{d}(t) $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{B}(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{dN_1}{dx} & \\frac{dN_2}{dx} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{1}{L} & \\frac{1}{L} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nIn the Galerkin method, the weighting functions are chosen to be the shape functions themselves, i.e., $w(x)$ is set to $N_i(x)$ for $i=1, 2$. This can be expressed in matrix form by setting the vector of weighting functions to $\\mathbf{w}(x) = \\mathbf{N}^T(x)$. Substituting these approximations into the weak form yields a system of ordinary differential equations:\n$$ \\left( \\int_{0}^{L} \\mathbf{N}^T(x) \\rho A \\mathbf{N}(x) dx \\right) \\ddot{\\mathbf{d}}(t) + \\left( \\int_{0}^{L} \\mathbf{B}^T(x) EA \\mathbf{B}(x) dx \\right) \\mathbf{d}(t) = \\mathbf{F}^e(t) $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{F}^e(t)$ is the element force vector.

The problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\na) Identification of rigid-body modes\n\nA rigid-body motion for a planar beam is described by a displacement field $v(x)$ that is at most linear in the spatial coordinate $x$. This is because such a motion induces no curvature, $v''(x) = 0$, and thus no strain. The general form is $v(x) = c_0 + c_1 x$, where $c_0$ and $c_1$ are constants. The rotation is the slope, $\\varphi(x) = v'(x) = c_1$.\n\nFor the rigid translation mode, $\\phi_t$:\nThe motion is a pure translation, so $v(x) = c_0$ and $\\varphi(x) = 0$.\nThe problem imposes the constraints $v_1 = v(0) = 1$ and $\\varphi_1 = \\varphi(0) = 0$.\nFrom $v(0)=1$, we have $c_0=1$. The displacement field must be $v(x) = 1$.\nThe nodal DOFs corresponding to this field are:\n$v_1 = v(0) = 1$\n$\\varphi_1 = v'(0) = 0$\n$v_2 = v(L) = 1$\n$\\varphi_2 = v'(L) = 0$\nAs a column vector, the translation mode is $\\phi_t = [1,\\ 0,\\ 1,\\ 0]^{\\mathsf{T}}$.\n\nFor the rigid rotation mode, $\\phi_r$:\nThe motion is a pure rotation about some center, described by $v(x) = c_0 + c_1 x$.\nThe problem imposes the constraints $\\varphi_1 = \\varphi(0) = 1$, $\\varphi_2 = \\varphi(L) = 1$, and $v_1 = v(0) = 0$.\nFrom $\\varphi(x) = c_1$, the constraints $\\varphi(0)=1$ and $\\varphi(L)=1$ both yield $c_1=1$.\nFrom $v(0)=0$, we have $c_0 + c_1(0) = 0$, so $c_0=0$.\nThe displacement field must be $v(x) = x$. This represents a rigid rotation about the origin $x=0$.\nThe nodal DOFs corresponding to this field are:\n$v_1 = v(0) = 0$\n$\\varphi_1 = v'(0) = 1$\n$v_2 = v(L) = L$\n$\\varphi_2 = v'(L) = 1$\nAs a column vector, the rotation mode is $\\phi_r = [0,\\ 1,\\ L,\\ 1]^{\\mathsf{T}}$.\n\nThe matrix of rigid-body modes is $\\Phi = [\\phi_t\\ \\ \\phi_r] = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & L \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nb) Verification of stiffness matrix annihilation\n\nThe element stiffness matrix $K$ must annihilate any rigid-body mode vector $\\phi$. This is a fundamental property reflecting that rigid-body motion induces no strain and hence no elastic restoring forces. We must show $K \\phi = 0$.\nThe $i$-th component of the vector $K \\phi$ is given by $(K\\phi)_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{4} K_{ij} \\phi_j$.\nSubstituting the definition of $K_{ij}$:\n$$ (K\\phi)_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{4} \\left( \\int_{0}^{L} E I\\, N_i''(x)\\, N_j''(x)\\, \\mathrm{d}x \\right) \\phi_j $$\nBy linearity of integration, we can write:\n$$ (K\\phi)_i = \\int_{0}^{L} E I\\, N_i''(x) \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{4} N_j''(x) \\phi_j \\right) \\mathrm{d}x $$\nThe expression $\\sum_{j=1}^{4} N_j(x) \\phi_j$ represents the displacement field $v_\\phi(x)$ corresponding to the nodal displacements in $\\phi$. Therefore, the term in the parentheses is the second derivative of this field:\n$$ v_\\phi''(x) = \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{4} N_j(x) \\phi_j \\right)'' = \\sum_{j=1}^{4} N_j''(x) \\phi_j $$\nFor any rigid-body mode, the corresponding displacement field $v_\\phi(x)$ is at most linear, so its second derivative $v_\\phi''(x)$ must be identically zero for all $x \\in [0, L]$.\nWe have already established the displacement fields: $v_t(x) = 1$ for $\\phi_t$ and $v_r(x) = x$ for $\\phi_r$.\nFor the translation mode $\\phi_t$, we have $v_t''(x) = (1)'' = 0$.\nFor the rotation mode $\\phi_r$, we have $v_r''(x) = (x)'' = 0$.\nThus, for both modes, the integrand is zero:\n$$ (K\\phi_t)_i = \\int_{0}^{L} E I\\, N_i''(x) \\cdot (0) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = 0 $$\n$$ (K\\phi_r)_i = \\int_{0}^{L} E I\\, N_i''(x) \\cdot (0) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = 0 $$\nSince this holds for each component $i=1, 2, 3, 4$, we have rigorously verified that $K \\phi_t = 0$ and $K \\phi_r = 0$.\n\nc) Computation of the determinant of the generalized mass matrix\n\nThe generalized mass matrix on the rigid-body subspace is $G = \\Phi^{\\mathsf{T}} M \\Phi$. Its components are $G_{ab} = \\phi_a^{\\mathsf{T}} M \\phi_b$ for $a, b \\in \\{t, r\\}$.\nWe can compute these components without explicit construction of the full mass matrix $M$. A component $\\phi_a^{\\mathsf{T}} M \\phi_b$ can be expressed as:\n$$ \\phi_a^{\\mathsf{T}} M \\phi_b = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\sum_{j=1}^{4} (\\phi_a)_i M_{ij} (\\phi_b)_j = \\sum_{i,j} (\\phi_a)_i \\left(\\int_{0}^{L} \\rho A\\, N_i(x)\\, N_j(x)\\, \\mathrm{d}x \\right) (\\phi_b)_j $$\n$$ = \\int_{0}^{L} \\rho A \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{4} N_i(x) (\\phi_a)_i\\right) \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{4} N_j(x) (\\phi_b)_j\\right) \\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{0}^{L} \\rho A\\, v_a(x)\\, v_b(x)\\, \\mathrm{d}x $$\nwhere $v_a(x)$ and $v_b(x)$ are the displacement fields for modes $\\phi_a$ and $\\phi_b$.\n\n$G_{11} = \\phi_t^{\\mathsf{T}} M \\phi_t = \\int_{0}^{L} \\rho A\\, v_t(x)\\, v_t(x)\\, \\mathrm{d}x$.
