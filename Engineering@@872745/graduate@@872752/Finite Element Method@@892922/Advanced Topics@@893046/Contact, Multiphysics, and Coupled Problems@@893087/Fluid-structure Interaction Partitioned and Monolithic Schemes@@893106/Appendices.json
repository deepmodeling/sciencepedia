The structure is a rigid piston of mass $m$ attached to a linear spring of stiffness $k$ and a linear dashpot of damping coefficient $c$. The piston closes one end of a straight tube of constant cross-sectional area $A$ filled with a compressible fluid of bulk modulus $K$ and initial column length $L_0$. Let $u_s(t)$ denote the piston displacement into the tube, taken as positive into the fluid. The fluid is assumed to remain spatially uniform in pressure over the time step, and the tube is sealed at its far end. The interface coupling enforces that the piston velocity equals the fluid boundary velocity (kinematic continuity), while the fluid pressure exerts a normal load on the piston (dynamic equilibrium).\n\nYou will apply a partitioned Dirichlet–Neumann (D–N) algorithm over a single time step from $t^n$ to $t^{n+1}=t^n+\\Delta t$ using an explicit staggered update:\n- Fluid substep (Dirichlet): Use the interface velocity at $t^n$ to kinematically predict the interface motion over $\\Delta t$, and then determine the fluid pressure at $t^{n+1}$ from mass conservation and linear compressibility.\n- Structure substep (Neumann): Use Newton’s second law with the fluid pressure at $t^{n+1}$ as the external load to compute the piston acceleration at $t^n$, and then update the piston displacement to $t^{n+1}$ using an explicit second-order kinematic expansion consistent with $v=\\mathrm{d}u/\\mathrm{d}t$ and $a=\\mathrm{d}v/\\mathrm{d}t$.\n\nUse the following data:\n- $m=10\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, $c=1000\\,\\mathrm{N\\,s/m}$, $k=10^6\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$,\n- $A=1.0\\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$, $L_0=1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $K=2.0\\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$,\n- $\\Delta t=1.0\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}$,\n- initial conditions at $t^n$: $u_s^n=0$, $v_s^n=0.10\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$,\n- gauge reference pressure $p_0=0$,\n- external non-fluid load $F_{\\mathrm{ext}}^n=0$.\n\nBase your derivation on:\n- Kinematics $v=\\mathrm{d}u/\\mathrm{d}t$ and $a=\\mathrm{d}v/\\mathrm{d}t$,\n- Newton’s second law for the piston with the fluid pressure load applied over area $A$ and acting opposite to positive $u_s$,\n- Linear compressibility of the fluid: the pressure increment satisfies $\\Delta p=-K\\,\\Delta V/V_0$, where $V_0=A L_0$ and the volume change due to piston motion is $\\Delta V=-A\\,u_s$.\n\nCompute the updated structural displacement $u_s^{n+1}$ produced by this single D–N step.

A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds by executing a single step of the prescribed partitioned Dirichlet–Neumann algorithm from time $t^n$ to $t^{n+1}$. The algorithm consists of two substeps.\n\n**Substep 1: Fluid Substep (Dirichlet prediction)**\n\nIn this substep, we predict the fluid pressure at time $t^{n+1}$ based on a kinematic prediction of the piston's motion.\nThe pressure-displacement relationship is derived from the linear compressibility law. The problem statement implies a total pressure formulation $p = p_0 + (K/L_0) u_s$. Let us verify this from the incremental form $\\Delta p = -K \\Delta V / V_0$. The change in volume from an initial state $(u_s=0, V=V_0)$ to a state with displacement $u_s$ is $\\Delta V = V - V_0 = A(L_0 - u_s) - A L_0 = -A u_s$. The corresponding change in pressure is $\\Delta p = p - p_0$. Thus, $p - p_0 = -K(-A u_s) / (A L_0) = K u_s / L_0$. With the given gauge reference pressure $p_0=0$, the fluid pressure is directly proportional to the piston displacement:\n$$p(t) = \\frac{K}{L_0} u_s(t)$$\nThe algorithm requires using the interface velocity at $t^n$ to predict the interface motion. We perform a first-order explicit prediction of the displacement at $t^{n+1}$, which we denote $\\tilde{u}_s^{n+1}$:\n$$\\tilde{u}_s^{n+1} = u_s^n + v_s^n \\Delta t$$\nUsing the given initial conditions $u_s^n = 0$, $v_s^n=0.10\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, and $\\Delta t=1.0\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}$:\n$$\\tilde{u}_s^{n+1} = 0 + (0.10\\,\\mathrm{m/s}) (1.0\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 1.0\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\nThis predicted displacement is used as a Dirichlet boundary condition for the fluid subproblem to find the pressure at $t^{n+1}$:\n$$p^{n+1} = \\frac{K}{L_0} \\tilde{u}_s^{n+1}$$\nSubstituting the values $K=2.0\\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$ and $L_0=1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$p^{n+1} = \\frac{2.0\\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}}{1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}} (1.0\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 2.0\\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$$\nThis pressure will be applied as a load on the structure in the next substep.\n\n**Substep 2: Structure Substep (Neumann update)**\n\nIn this substep, we compute the structural response. The equation of motion for the piston (structure) is given by Newton's second law:\n$$m a_s(t) + c v_s(t) + k u_s(t) = F_{\\mathrm{ext}}(t) - p(t) A$$\nwhere $a_s(t)$ is the acceleration. The algorithm specifies using the fluid pressure $p^{n+1}$ to compute the acceleration at time $t^n$. The state variables of the structure ($u_s^n$, $v_s^n$) are taken at time $t^n$:\n$$m a_s^n = F_{\\mathrm{ext}}^n - p^{n+1} A - c v_s^n - k u_s^n$$\nWe solve for the acceleration $a_s^n$:\n$$a_s^n = \\frac{1}{m} (F_{\\mathrm{ext}}^n - p^{n+1} A - c v_s^n - k u_s^n)$$\nSubstituting the given values: $m=10\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, $F_{\\mathrm{ext}}^n=0$, $p^{n+1}=2.0\\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, $A=1.0\\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$, $c=1000\\,\\mathrm{N\\,s/m}$, $v_s^n=0.10\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $k=10^6\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$, and $u_s^n=0$:\n$$a_s^n = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( 0 - (2.0\\times 10^5)(1.0\\times 10^{-2}) - (1000)(0.10) - (10^6)(0) \\right)$$\n$$a_s^n = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( -2000 - 100 - 0 \\right) = \\frac{-2100}{10} = -210\\,\\mathrm{m/s^2}$$\nNext, we update the piston displacement to $t^{n+1}$ using the specified explicit second-order kinematic expansion, which is a Taylor series expansion of $u_s(t)$ around $t^n$:\n$$u_s^{n+1} = u_s^n + v_s^n \\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2} a_s^n (\\Delta t)^2$$\nSubstituting the known and computed values:\n$$u_s^{n+1} = 0 + (0.10\\,\\mathrm{m/s})(1.0\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}) + \\frac{1}{2}(-210\\,\\mathrm{m/s^2})(1.0\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s})^2$$\n$$u_s^{n+1} = 1.0\\times 10^{-4} + \\frac{1}{2}(-210)(1.0\\times 10^{-6})$$\n$$u_s^{n+1} = 1.0\\times 10^{-4} - 105 \\times 1.0\\times 10^{-6}$$\n$$u_s^{n+1} = 1.0\\times 10^{-4} - 1.05\\times 10^{-4}$$\n$$u_s^{n+1} = -0.05\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m} = -5.0\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$u_s^{n+1} = -5.000\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\nThis is the updated structural displacement after one step of the D–N algorithm.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-5.000 \\times 10^{-6}}\n$$", "id": "2560189"}, {"introduction": "While partitioned schemes are conceptually straightforward, they can suffer from numerical instabilities, especially in problems with lightweight structures and dense fluids.

The problem is well-posed, scientifically sound, and internally consistent. We shall proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe system consists of a structural mass $m_s$ on a spring of stiffness $k$, and a fluid with added mass $m_a$. The force exerted by the fluid on the structure is given as $F_f(t) = -m_a \\ddot{x}(t)$. The equation of motion for the structure is $m_s \\ddot{x}(t) + k x(t) = F_f(t)$.

Express your final answer as a single real number. No rounding is required and no units are to be provided in the final answer.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It presents a standard formulation of a fluid-structure interaction problem using established principles of continuum mechanics, namely the Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible fluid and linear elasticity for a solid. The coupling conditions are the standard kinematic and dynamic continuity requirements at the interface. The task is a theoretical derivation based on these axioms, which is a valid scientific question. All necessary information is provided, and there are no contradictions. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the global mechanical power balance for the coupled fluid-structure system. We begin from the provided governing equations.\n\nFirst, we identify the interface. The problem describes a fluid domain $\\Omega_{f}(t)$ below a flexible solid wall $\\Omega_{s}(t)$. The interface $\\Gamma_{fs}(t)$ is the common, time-dependent boundary separating these two subdomains, i.e., $\\Gamma_{fs}(t) = \\partial\\Omega_{f}(t) \\cap \\partial\\Omega_{s}(t)$.\n\nWe will derive the power balance for each subdomain separately and then combine them.\n\n1.  Power balance for the fluid domain $\\Omega_{f}(t)$:\nWe take the Cauchy momentum equation for the fluid,\n$$ \\rho_{f}\\left(\\partial_{t}\\boldsymbol{u}_{f} + (\\boldsymbol{u}_{f}\\cdot \\nabla)\\boldsymbol{u}_{f}\\right) = \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{f} + \\rho_{f}\\boldsymbol{b}_{f} $$\nand take the inner product with the fluid velocity $\\boldsymbol{u}_{f}$ and integrate over the fluid domain $\\Omega_{f}(t)$.\nThe term on the left represents the power of the inertial forces per unit volume. Integrating this over the material volume of the fluid gives the rate of change of the fluid's total kinetic energy, $E_{k}^{f} = \\int_{\\Omega_{f}(t)} \\frac{1}{2}\\rho_{f}|\\boldsymbol{u}_{f}|^2 \\mathrm{d}\\Omega$.\n$$ \\frac{dE_{k}^{f}}{dt} = \\int_{\\Omega_{f}(t)} \\boldsymbol{u}_{f} \\cdot \\left( \\rho_{f}\\left(\\partial_{t}\\boldsymbol{u}_{f} + (\\boldsymbol{u}_{f}\\cdot \\nabla)\\boldsymbol{u}_{f}\\right) \\right) \\mathrm{d}\\Omega $$\nThus, the integrated momentum equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dE_{k}^{f}}{dt} = \\int_{\\Omega_{f}(t)} \\boldsymbol{u}_{f} \\cdot (\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{f}) \\mathrm{d}\\Omega + \\int_{\\Omega_{f}(t)} \\rho_{f} \\boldsymbol{u}_{f} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{b}_{f} \\mathrm{d}\\Omega $$\nThe second term on the right is the power supplied by the body forces in the fluid, $P_{ext, b}^{f}$. For the first term, we use the identity $\\nabla \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{f}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{u}_{f}) = (\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{f}) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}_{f} + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{f} : \\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}_{f}$. Since the Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{f}$ is symmetric, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{f}^{\\top} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{f}$. Applying the divergence theorem, we obtain:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega_{f}(t)} \\boldsymbol{u}_{f} \\cdot (\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{f}) \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\int_{\\partial \\Omega_{f}(t)} \\boldsymbol{u}_{f} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{f} \\boldsymbol{n}_{f}) \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma - \\int_{\\Omega_{f}(t)} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{f} : \\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}_{f} \\mathrm{d}\\Omega $$\nThe term $\\int_{\\Omega_{f}(t)} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{f} : \\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}_{f} \\mathrm{d}\\Omega$ represents the internal stress power. We substitute the constitutive relation for the fluid stress, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{f} = -p \\boldsymbol{I} + 2\\mu \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\boldsymbol{u}_{f})$.\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{f} : \\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}_{f} = (-p \\boldsymbol{I} + 2\\mu \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\boldsymbol{u}_{f})) : \\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}_{f} = -p (\\boldsymbol{I} : \\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}_{f}) + 2\\mu \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\boldsymbol{u}_{f}) : \\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}_{f} $$\nDue to the incompressibility condition $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}_{f} = 0$, the first part of the stress power vanishes because $\\boldsymbol{I} : \\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}_{f} = \\mathrm{tr}(\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}_{f}) = \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}_{f} = 0$. For the second part, since $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\boldsymbol{u}_{f})$ is symmetric, its double dot product with $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}_{f}$ is equivalent to its product with the symmetric part of $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}_{f}$, which is $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\boldsymbol{u}_{f})$ itself. So, $2\\mu \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\boldsymbol{u}_{f}) : \\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}_{f} = 2\\mu \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\boldsymbol{u}_{f}) : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\boldsymbol{u}_{f})$. This term, when integrated over the volume, represents the viscous dissipation rate $D_{f}$, which is always non-negative.\n$$ D_{f} = \\int_{\\Omega_{f}(t)} 2\\mu \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\boldsymbol{u}_{f}) : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\boldsymbol{u}_{f}) \\mathrm{d}\\Omega $$\nCombining these results, the power balance for the fluid is:\n$$ \\frac{dE_{k}^{f}}{dt} = \\int_{\\partial \\Omega_{f}(t)} \\boldsymbol{u}_{f} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{f} \\boldsymbol{n}_{f}) \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma - D_{f} + P_{ext, b}^{f} $$\n\n2.  Power balance for the solid domain $\\Omega_{s}(t)$:\nWe follow a similar procedure for the solid momentum equation:\n$$ \\rho_{s}\\,\\partial_{t}\\boldsymbol{u}_{s} = \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s} + \\rho_{s}\\boldsymbol{b}_{s} $$\nWe take the inner product with the solid velocity $\\boldsymbol{u}_{s}$ and integrate over the solid domain $\\Omega_{s}(t)$. The domain $\\Omega_{s}(t)$ is a material domain, moving with the solid. The rate of change of the solid's kinetic energy, $E_{k}^{s} = \\int_{\\Omega_{s}(t)} \\frac{1}{2}\\rho_{s}|\\boldsymbol{u}_{s}|^2 \\mathrm{d}\\Omega$, is given by:\n$$ \\frac{dE_{k}^{s}}{dt} = \\int_{\\Omega_{s}(t)} \\boldsymbol{u}_{s} \\cdot (\\rho_{s} \\partial_{t}\\boldsymbol{u}_{s}) \\mathrm{d}\\Omega $$\nThus, the integrated momentum equation for the solid is:\n$$ \\frac{dE_{k}^{s}}{dt} = \\int_{\\Omega_{s}(t)} \\boldsymbol{u}_{s} \\cdot (\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s}) \\mathrm{d}\\Omega + \\int_{\\Omega_{s}(t)} \\rho_{s} \\boldsymbol{u}_{s} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{b}_{s} \\mathrm{d}\\Omega $$\nThe second term on the right is the power from body forces, $P_{ext, b}^{s}$. Using the divergence theorem on the first term (with symmetric stress $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s}$):\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega_{s}(t)} \\boldsymbol{u}_{s} \\cdot (\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s}) \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\int_{\\partial \\Omega_{s}(t)} \\boldsymbol{u}_{s} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s} \\boldsymbol{n}_{s}) \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma - \\int_{\\Omega_{s}(t)} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s} : \\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}_{s} \\mathrm{d}\\Omega $$\nThe stress power term is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s} : \\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}_{s}$. Since $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s}$ is symmetric and $\\boldsymbol{u}_{s} = \\partial_{t}\\boldsymbol{d}$, we have $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s} : \\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}_{s} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s} : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\boldsymbol{u}_{s}) = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s} : \\partial_{t}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\boldsymbol{d})$. For a hyperelastic material (which the given model is), this term represents the rate of change of the stored elastic strain energy density, $\\dot{W}$. The total elastic strain energy is $E_{e}^{s} = \\int_{\\Omega_{s}(t)} W \\mathrm{d}\\Omega$, where $W = \\frac{1}{2} \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\boldsymbol{d}) : \\mathbb{C} : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\boldsymbol{d})$. The rate of change of total elastic energy is:\n$$ \\frac{dE_{e}^{s}}{dt} = \\int_{\\Omega_{s}(t)} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s} : \\partial_{t}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\boldsymbol{d}) \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\int_{\\Omega_{s}(t)} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s} : \\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}_{s} \\mathrm{d}\\Omega $$\nThe solid model is purely elastic, so there is no dissipation term. The power balance for the solid is:\n$$ \\frac{dE_{k}^{s}}{dt} + \\frac{dE_{e}^{s}}{dt} = \\int_{\\partial \\Omega_{s}(t)} \\boldsymbol{u}_{s} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s} \\boldsymbol{n}_{s}) \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma + P_{ext, b}^{s} $$\n\n3.  Global power balance and the interface contribution:\nWe now sum the power balance equations for the fluid and the solid:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}(E_{k}^{f} + E_{k}^{s} + E_{e}^{s}) = \\int_{\\partial \\Omega_{f}(t)} \\boldsymbol{u}_{f} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{f} \\boldsymbol{n}_{f}) \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma + \\int_{\\partial \\Omega_{s}(t)} \\boldsymbol{u}_{s} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s} \\boldsymbol{n}_{s}) \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma - D_{f} + P_{ext, b}^{f} + P_{ext, b}^{s} $$\nThe boundaries of the subdomains are composted of the external boundaries and the common interface: $\\partial\\Omega_{f}(t) = \\Gamma_{ext}^{f} \\cup \\Gamma_{fs}(t)$ and $\\partial\\Omega_{s}(t) = \\Gamma_{ext}^{s} \\cup \\Gamma_{fs}(t)$. We split the boundary integrals:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}(E_{k}^{f} + E_{k}^{s} + E_{e}^{s}) + D_{f} = \\int_{\\Gamma_{ext}^{f}} \\boldsymbol{u}_{f} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{f} \\boldsymbol{n}_{f}) \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma + \\int_{\\Gamma_{ext}^{s}} \\boldsymbol{u}_{s} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s} \\boldsymbol{n}_{s}) \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma + \\left[ \\int_{\\Gamma_{fs}(t)} \\boldsymbol{u}_{f} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{f} \\boldsymbol{n}_{f}) \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma + \\int_{\\Gamma_{fs}(t)} \\boldsymbol{u}_{s} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s} \\boldsymbol{n}_{s}) \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma \\right] + P_{ext, b} $$\nwhere $P_{ext, b} = P_{ext, b}^{f} + P_{ext, b}^{s}$. The first two integrals on the right are the power from tractions on the external boundaries, which together with $P_{ext, b}$ constitute the total external power $P_{ext}$. The term in brackets represents the power exchanged at the interface.\nLet us examine this interface contribution using the coupling conditions on $\\Gamma_{fs}(t)$:\n(i) Kinematic continuity: $\\boldsymbol{u}_{f} = \\boldsymbol{u}_{s}$.\n(ii) Dynamic equilibrium: $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{f}\\boldsymbol{n}_{f} + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s}\\boldsymbol{n}_{s} = \\boldsymbol{0}$.\n\nSubstituting continuity of velocity (i) into the interface power terms:\n$$ \\int_{\\Gamma_{fs}(t)} \\boldsymbol{u}_{s} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{f} \\boldsymbol{n}_{f}) \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma + \\int_{\\Gamma_{fs}(t)} \\boldsymbol{u}_{s} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s} \\boldsymbol{n}_{s}) \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma = \\int_{\\Gamma_{fs}(t)} \\boldsymbol{u}_{s} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{f} \\boldsymbol{n}_{f} + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s} \\boldsymbol{n}_{s}) \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma $$\nNow, using the equilibrium of tractions (ii), the integrand becomes $\\boldsymbol{u}_{s} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{0} = 0$.\n$$ \\int_{\\Gamma_{fs}(t)} 0 \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma = 0 $$\nThe interface contribution cancels exactly. This demonstrates that for a perfectly coupled system, there is no net generation or loss of energy at the interface; there is only a conservative transfer of power.\nThe final global power balance is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}(E_{k}^{f} + E_{k}^{s} + E_{e}^{s}) = P_{ext} - D_{f} $$\nThis equation states that the rate of change of the total mechanical energy (fluid kinetic + solid kinetic + solid elastic) equals the power supplied by all external forces minus the rate of viscous dissipation in the fluid.\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute the scalar interfacial power functional $I(t)$:\n$$ I(t) := \\int_{\\Gamma_{fs}(t)} \\left(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{f}\\boldsymbol{n}_{f}\\right)\\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}_{f}\\, \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma \\;+\\; \\int_{\\Gamma_{fs}(t)} \\left(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s}\\boldsymbol{n}_{s}\\right)\\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}_{s}\\, \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma $$\nThis is precisely the interface power contribution we have just analyzed. Applying the coupling conditions as before:\n$$ I(t) = \\int_{\\Gamma_{fs}(t)} \\boldsymbol{u}_{f} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{f}\\boldsymbol{n}_{f}) \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma + \\int_{\\Gamma_{fs}(t)} \\boldsymbol{u}_{s} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s}\\boldsymbol{n}_{s}) \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma $$\nUsing $\\boldsymbol{u}_{f} = \\boldsymbol{u}_{s}$ on $\\Gamma_{fs}(t)$:\n$$ I(t) = \\int_{\\Gamma_{fs}(t)} \\boldsymbol{u}_{s} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{f}\\boldsymbol{n}_{f}) \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma + \\int_{\\Gamma_{fs}(t)} \\boldsymbol{u}_{s} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s}\\boldsymbol{n}_{s}) \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma = \\int_{\\Gamma_{fs}(t)} \\boldsymbol{u}_{s} \\cdot \\left( \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{f}\\boldsymbol{n}_{f} + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s}\\boldsymbol{n}_{s} \\right) \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma $$\nUsing $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{f}\\boldsymbol{n}_{f} + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s}\\boldsymbol{n}_{s} = \\boldsymbol{0}$ on $\\Gamma_{fs}(t)$:\n$$ I(t) = \\int_{\\Gamma_{fs}(t)} \\boldsymbol{u}_{s} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{0} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma = 0 $$\nThe value of the functional $I(t)$ is zero for all time $t$.
