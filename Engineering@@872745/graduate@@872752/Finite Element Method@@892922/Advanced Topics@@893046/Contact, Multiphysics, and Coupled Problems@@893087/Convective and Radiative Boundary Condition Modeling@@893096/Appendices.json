It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard, albeit elementary, problem in heat transfer that serves to illustrate the critical importance of using absolute temperature scales in calculations involving the Stefan-Boltzmann law. We will now proceed with the formal solution.\n\nFirst, we must derive the expression for the net radiative heat flux, which is the boundary traction contribution in the Finite Element Method formulation. The surface at $x=L$ is described as a diffuse-gray surface with temperature $T_s$ and emissivity $\\epsilon$, exchanging heat with large surroundings at temperature $T_{\\infty}$.\n\n1.  **Emission**: According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the emissive power of a real (gray) surface is given by $E = \\epsilon \\sigma T_s^4$, where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and $T_s$ is the absolute surface temperature in kelvin. This is the energy radiated away from the surface per unit area.\n\n2.  **Irradiation and Absorption**: The surroundings are considered to be a large enclosure that behaves as a blackbody radiator at an absolute temperature $T_{\\infty}$. The radiation incident on the surface from the surroundings, known as irradiation, is therefore $G = \\sigma T_{\\infty}^4$. A fraction of this incident radiation is absorbed by the surface. The absorptivity, $\\alpha$, of a gray surface is equal to its emissivity, $\\epsilon$, a consequence of Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation. Thus, the absorbed radiative flux is $G_{abs} = \\alpha G = \\epsilon \\sigma T_{\\infty}^4$.\n\n3.  **Net Flux**: The net radiative heat flux, $q_{\\text{rad}}$, is the difference between the emitted flux and the absorbed flux. It represents the net rate of energy leaving the surface per unit area due to radiation.\n    $$q_{\\text{rad}} = E - G_{abs} = \\epsilon \\sigma T_s^4 - \\epsilon \\sigma T_{\\infty}^4$$\n    This simplifies to the correct expression for the radiative boundary traction:\n    $$q_{\\text{correct}} = \\epsilon \\sigma (T_s^4 - T_{\\infty}^4)$$\n    It is imperative to recognize that $T_s$ and $T_{\\infty}$ in this equation must be expressed in an absolute temperature scale, such as kelvin $(\\mathrm{K})$.\n\nNow, we compute the relative error caused by the described blunder. The engineer incorrectly uses temperatures in degrees Celsius $(^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$ instead of kelvin. We are given the surface temperature $T_{s,C} = 120 \\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and the environment temperature $T_{\\infty,C} = 25 \\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\nThe conversion from Celsius to Kelvin is $T_K = T_C + 273.15$.\nThe correct absolute temperatures are:\n$T_{s,K} = 120 + 273.15 = 393.15 \\, \\mathrm{K}$\n$T_{\\infty,K} = 25 + 273.15 = 298.15 \\, \\mathrm{K}$\n\nThe correct radiative flux is:\n$$q_{\\text{correct}} = \\epsilon \\sigma (T_{s,K}^4 - T_{\\infty,K}^4) = \\epsilon \\sigma \\left( (393.15)^4 - (298.15)^4 \\right)$$\n\nThe incorrectly calculated flux, using Celsius values directly, is:\n$$q_{\\text{wrong}} = \\epsilon \\sigma (T_{s,C}^4 - T_{\\infty,C}^4) = \\epsilon \\sigma \\left( (120)^4 - (25)^4 \\right)$$\n\nThe signed relative error $\\delta$ is defined as:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{q_{\\text{wrong}} - q_{\\text{correct}}}{q_{\\text{correct}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the fluxes:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{\\epsilon \\sigma (T_{s,C}^4 - T_{\\infty,C}^4) - \\epsilon \\sigma (T_{s,K}^4 - T_{\\infty,K}^4)}{\\epsilon \\sigma (T_{s,K}^4 - T_{\\infty,K}^4)}$$\nThe term $\\epsilon \\sigma$ is a non-zero common factor and cancels out, leaving:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{T_{s,C}^4 - T_{\\infty,C}^4}{T_{s,K}^4 - T_{\\infty,K}^4} - 1$$\n\nWe now substitute the numerical values:\nNumerator calculation:\n$$T_{s,C}^4 - T_{\\infty,C}^4 = (120)^4 - (25)^4 = 207360000 - 390625 = 206969375$$\nDenominator calculation:\n$$T_{s,K}^4 - T_{\\infty,K}^4 = (393.15)^4 - (298.15)^4 \\approx 2.39025 \\times 10^{10} - 7.89617 \\times 10^9 = 1.60063 \\times 10^{10}$$\nThe precise difference is $16006345000$.\n\nNow we compute the ratio:\n$$\\frac{T_{s,C}^4 - T_{\\infty,C}^4}{T_{s,K}^4 - T_{\\infty,K}^4} = \\frac{206969375}{16006345000} \\approx 0.0129304$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the relative error $\\delta$:\n$$\\delta = 0.0129304 - 1 = -0.9870696$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $9, 8, 7, 0$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of heat transfer, namely Fourier's law of conduction and the Stefan-Boltzmann law of radiation. The problem is well-posed, describing a one-dimensional, steady-state boundary value problem with sufficient and consistent conditions. The language is objective and the parameters provided are physically realistic.\n\nThe solution process begins with the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for steady-state one-dimensional heat conduction with no internal heat generation:\n$$ -k\\,T''(x) = 0 $$\nwhere $k$ is the thermal conductivity, assumed constant. Since $k0$, this simplifies to $T''(x) = 0$. The general solution to this ODE is a linear function of $x$:\n$$ T(x) = C_1 x + C_2 $$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants of integration.\n\nThese constants are determined by applying the boundary conditions. We define the unknown temperature at $x=0$ as $T_0 \\equiv T(0)$. The two conditions are:\n$1$. At $x=0$: $T(0) = T_0$.\n$2$. At $x=L$: $T(L) = \\bar{T}$.\n\nApplying the first condition to the general solution gives:\n$$ T(0) = C_1(0) + C_2 = T_0 \\implies C_2 = T_0 $$\nApplying the second condition gives:\n$$ T(L) = C_1 L + C_2 = \\bar{T} $$\nSubstituting $C_2=T_0$ into the second equation allows us to solve for $C_1$:\n$$ C_1 L + T_0 = \\bar{T} \\implies C_1 = \\frac{\\bar{T} - T_0}{L} $$\nThus, the temperature distribution along the rod is fully determined by the unknown boundary temperature $T_0$:\n$$ T(x) = \\left(\\frac{\\bar{T} - T_0}{L}\\right) x + T_0 $$\nThe heat flux is given by Fourier's Law, $q(x) = -k\\,T'(x)$. The derivative of the temperature is:\n$$ T'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}T(x) = \\frac{\\bar{T} - T_0}{L} $$\nThis is a constant, indicating that the heat flux is uniform throughout the rod, which is consistent with a steady-state problem with no heat sources.\n\nThe problem specifies a nonlinear radiative boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$ -k\\,T'(0) = \\epsilon\\,\\sigma\\left(T(0)^4 - T_{\\infty}^4\\right) $$\nThe term $T'(0)$ is defined as the derivative with respect to the outward unit normal at $x=0$. For a domain on $[0, L]$, the outward normal at $x=0$ points in the negative $x$-direction. Therefore, the normal derivative is $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial n}|_{x=0} = -\\frac{dT}{dx}|_{x=0}$. The problem's notation $T'(0)$ corresponds to this normal derivative.\n$$ T'(0) = -\\frac{dT}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = -\\left(\\frac{\\bar{T} - T_0}{L}\\right) = \\frac{T_0 - \\bar{T}}{L} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $T'(0)$ and $T(0)=T_0$ into the radiative boundary condition yields:\n$$ -k \\left(\\frac{T_0 - \\bar{T}}{L}\\right) = \\epsilon\\,\\sigma\\left(T_0^4 - T_{\\infty}^4\\right) $$\nRearranging the left side gives:\n$$ \\frac{k}{L}(\\bar{T} - T_0) = \\epsilon\\,\\sigma\\left(T_0^4 - T_{\\infty}^4\\right) $$\nThis equation represents the physical balance at $x=0$: the heat conducted into the boundary from the rod, $\\frac{k}{L}(\\bar{T} - T_0)$, must equal the heat radiated away from the boundary, $\\epsilon\\,\\sigma(T_0^4 - T_{\\infty}^4)$. This is the desired single nonlinear algebraic equation for the unknown scalar $T_0$.\n\nTo solve this equation numerically, we employ the Newton-Raphson method. First, we define a residual function $R(T_0)$ by bringing all terms to one side:\n$$ R(T_0) = \\frac{k}{L}(\\bar{T} - T_0) - \\epsilon\\,\\sigma\\left(T_0^4 - T_{\\infty}^4\\right) = 0 $$\nThe Newton iteration requires the derivative of the residual function with respect to the unknown, $T_0$. This derivative, $R'(T_0)$, is the Jacobian of the scalar system:\n$$ R'(T_0) = \\frac{d}{dT_0} \\left[ \\frac{k}{L}(\\bar{T} - T_0) - \\epsilon\\,\\sigma(T_0^4 - T_{\\infty}^4) \\right] $$\n$$ R'(T_0) = -\\frac{k}{L} - \\epsilon\\,\\sigma(4T_0^3) = -\\left(\\frac{k}{L} + 4\\epsilon\\,\\sigma T_0^3\\right) $$\nFor any physically meaningful temperature $T_0 > 0$, the derivative $R'(T_0)$ is strictly negative, as $k, L, \\epsilon, \\sigma$ are positive constants. This ensures that the residual function is monotonically decreasing, guaranteeing a unique positive root.\n\nThe Newton-Raphson iteration is given by the update rule:\n$$ T_{0,n+1} = T_{0,n} - \\frac{R(T_{0,n})}{R'(T_{0,n})} $$\nwhere $T_{0,n}$ is the estimate of $T_0$ at iteration $n$.\n\nThe implementation will use this iteration. A suitable initial guess is $T_{0,0} = \\bar{T}$. The iteration continues until the absolute value of the residual, $|R(T_{0,n})|$, falls below a specified tolerance. A globalization strategy, specifically a backtracking line search, is included to ensure robust convergence. The update is modified to $T_{0,n+1} = T_{0,n} + \\alpha \\Delta T_{0,n}$, where $\\Delta T_{0,n} = -R(T_{0,n})/R'(T_{0,n})$ is the full Newton step and $\\alpha \\in (0, 1]$ is a damping factor. We start with $\\alpha=1$ and successively halve it until a sufficient decrease in the residual norm is achieved, i.e., $|R(T_{0,n+1})|  |R(T_{0,n})|$.\n\nIn the special case where the emissivity $\\epsilon=0$, the boundary condition simplifies to $\\frac{k}{L}(\\bar{T} - T_0) = 0$, which implies $T_0 = \\bar{T}$. This corresponds to an insulated boundary, where zero heat flux ($T'(x)=0$) leads to a uniform temperature profile.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by carrying out the three specified tasks.\n\nTask 1: Determination of the volumetric source $s(x,y)$\nThe governing equation is the stationary energy balance, given as $-\\nabla\\cdot(k\\nabla T) = s(x,y)$. With a constant thermal conductivity $k=1$, this simplifies to the Poisson equation, $-\\nabla^{2}T = s(x,y)$, where $\\nabla^{2}$ is the Laplace operator.\nThe manufactured temperature field is $T(x,y)=1+x^{2}+y^{2}$.\nFirst, we compute the gradient of the temperature field, $\\nabla T$:\n$$ \\nabla T(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\mathbf{i} + \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}\\mathbf{j} $$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(1+x^{2}+y^{2}) = 2x $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(1+x^{2}+y^{2}) = 2y $$\nSo, the gradient is $\\nabla T(x,y) = 2x\\mathbf{i} + 2y\\mathbf{j}$.\nNext, we compute the Laplacian of the temperature field, $\\nabla^{2}T = \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla T)$:\n$$ \\nabla^{2}T = \\frac{\\partial^{2}T}{\\partial x^{2}} + \\frac{\\partial^{2}T}{\\partial y^{2}} $$\nThe second partial derivatives are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^{2}T}{\\partial x^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(2x) = 2 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^{2}T}{\\partial y^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(2y) = 2 $$\nThe Laplacian is therefore constant:\n$$ \\nabla^{2}T = 2 + 2 = 4 $$\nThe source term $s(x,y)$ is then found from the governing equation:\n$$ s(x,y) = -\\nabla^{2}T = -4 $$\nThus, a constant volumetric heat sink of magnitude $4$ is required to sustain the given temperature field.\n\nTask 2: Determination of boundary data on $\\Gamma_{L}$, $\\Gamma_{T}$, and $\\Gamma_{B}$\nThe boundary conditions are derived by forcing the manufactured solution $T(x,y)$ to satisfy them exactly.\n\nOn the left boundary $\\Gamma_{L}=\\{x=0,\\,0\\le y\\le 1\\}$, an essential (Dirichlet) condition is imposed. The prescribed temperature, $\\bar{T}_{\\Gamma_{L}}(y)$, is the trace of $T(x,y)$ on this boundary:\n$$ \\bar{T}_{\\Gamma_{L}}(y) = T(0,y) = 1+0^{2}+y^{2} = 1+y^{2} $$\n\nOn the top boundary $\\Gamma_{T}=\\{0\\le x\\le 1,\\,y=1\\}$, an essential (Dirichlet) condition is also imposed. The prescribed temperature, $\\bar{T}_{\\Gamma_{T}}(x)$, is the trace of $T(x,y)$ on this boundary:\n$$ \\bar{T}_{\\Gamma_{T}}(x) = T(x,1) = 1+x^{2}+1^{2} = 2+x^{2} $$\n\nOn the bottom boundary $\\Gamma_{B}=\\{0\\le x\\le 1,\\,y=0\\}$, a natural (Neumann) condition is imposed. This condition specifies the outward normal heat flux, $\\bar{q}_{\\Gamma_{B}}(x)$. The heat flux vector is given by Fourier's law, $\\mathbf{q} = -k\\nabla T$. The outward normal flux is $\\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = -k\\nabla T \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$.\nThe outward unit normal vector on $\\Gamma_{B}$ is $\\mathbf{n} = (0,-1)$.\nThe prescribed flux is:\n$$ \\bar{q}_{\\Gamma_{B}}(x) = -k\\nabla T(x,0) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = -1 \\cdot (2x, 2(0)) \\cdot (0,-1) = -(2x,0) \\cdot (0,-1) = -(2x)(0)-(0)(-1) = 0 $$\nTherefore, the boundary $\\Gamma_{B}$ is adiabatic (perfectly insulated).\n\nTask 3: Determination of the ambient temperature profile on $\\Gamma_{R}$\nOn the right boundary $\\Gamma_{R}=\\{x=1,\\,0\\le y\\le 1\\}$, a Robin-type condition is imposed. This condition relates the outward normal conductive heat flux to the heat transfer to an ambient medium:\n$$ -k\\nabla T \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = h(T-T_{\\infty}) $$\nHere, $h$ is a constant positive heat transfer coefficient and $T_{\\infty}(y)$ is the ambient temperature profile to be determined.\nThe outward unit normal vector on $\\Gamma_{R}$ is $\\mathbf{n}=(1,0)$.\nThe left-hand side (LHS) of the equation is the outward conductive flux, evaluated at $x=1$:\n$$ \\text{LHS} = -k\\nabla T(1,y) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = -1 \\cdot (2(1), 2y) \\cdot (1,0) = -(2,2y) \\cdot (1,0) = -2 $$\nThe right-hand side (RHS) of the equation involves the temperature on the boundary, $T(1,y)$, and the unknown ambient temperature, $T_{\\infty,\\Gamma_{R}}(y)$:\n$$ T(1,y) = 1+1^{2}+y^{2} = 2+y^{2} $$\n$$ \\text{RHS} = h(T(1,y) - T_{\\infty,\\Gamma_{R}}(y)) = h((2+y^{2}) - T_{\\infty,\\Gamma_{R}}(y)) $$\nEquating the LHS and RHS gives:\n$$ -2 = h(2+y^{2} - T_{\\infty,\\Gamma_{R}}(y)) $$\nWe now solve for $T_{\\infty,\\Gamma_{R}}(y)$:\n$$ -\\frac{2}{h} = 2+y^{2} - T_{\\infty,\\Gamma_{R}}(y) $$\n$$ T_{\\infty,\\Gamma_{R}}(y) = 2+y^{2} + \\frac{2}{h} $$\nThis expression gives the required ambient temperature profile along $\\Gamma_R$ that ensures the manufactured solution is exactly satisfied.\n\nFinal collection of results:\nThe required boundary quantities are:\n- Prescribed temperature on $\\Gamma_L$: $\\bar{T}_{\\Gamma_{L}}(y) = 1+y^{2}$\n- Prescribed temperature on $\\Gamma_T$: $\\bar{T}_{\\Gamma_{T}}(x) = 2+x^{2}$\n- Prescribed outward normal flux on $\\Gamma_B$: $\\bar{q}_{\\Gamma_{B}}(x) = 0$\n- Heat transfer coefficient on $\\Gamma_R$: $h$ (a given positive constant)\n- Ambient temperature on $\\Gamma_R$: $T_{\\infty,\\Gamma_{R}}(y) = 2+y^{2} + \\frac{2}{h}$\n\nThese results are presented in the required matrix format.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1+y^{2}  2+x^{2}  0  h  2+y^{2}+\\frac{2}{h} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2549238"}]}
