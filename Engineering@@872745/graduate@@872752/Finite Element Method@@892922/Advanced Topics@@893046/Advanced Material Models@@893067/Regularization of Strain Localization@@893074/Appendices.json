It is a standard, self-contained, and well-posed problem in mathematical physics and engineering science. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe Green's function, $G_{\\ell}(x)$, for the linear, translation-invariant operator $L = 1 - \\ell^2 \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}$ is defined by the distributional differential equation:\n$$L G_{\\ell}(x) = \\left(1-\\ell^{2}\\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}}\\right)G_{\\ell}(x)=\\delta(x)$$\nwhere $\\delta(x)$ is the Dirac delta distribution. The boundary conditions require that $G_{\\ell}(x) \\to 0$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$.\n\nFor $x \\neq 0$, the equation is homogeneous:\n$$G_{\\ell}(x) - \\ell^2 \\frac{d^2G_{\\ell}}{dx^2}(x) = 0$$\nThe characteristic equation is $1 - \\ell^2 r^2 = 0$, which has roots $r = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\ell}$. The general solution for $x \\neq 0$ is a linear combination of exponential functions:\n$$G_{\\ell}(x) = c_1 \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{\\ell}\\right) + c_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\ell}\\right)$$\nApplying the boundary condition $G_{\\ell}(x) \\to 0$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$ restricts the solution.\nFor $x>0$, we must have $c_1=0$ to ensure decay as $x \\to \\infty$. Thus, $G_{\\ell}(x) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\ell}\\right)$ for some constant $A$.\nFor $x<0$, we must have $c_2=0$ to ensure decay as $x \\to -\\infty$. Thus, $G_{\\ell}(x) = B \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{\\ell}\\right)$ for some constant $B$.\nThis can be written compactly using the absolute value as $G_{\\ell}(x) = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|}{\\ell}\\right)$ for some constant $C$. Continuity of the Green's function at $x=0$ is satisfied by this form.\n\nTo determine the constant $C$, we integrate the defining equation for $G_{\\ell}(x)$ over an infinitesimal interval $[-\\eta, \\eta]$ around $x=0$:\n$$\\int_{-\\eta}^{\\eta} \\left(G_{\\ell}(x) - \\ell^2 \\frac{d^2G_{\\ell}}{dx^2}(x)\\right) dx = \\int_{-\\eta}^{\\eta} \\delta(x) dx = 1$$\nIn the limit as $\\eta \\to 0$, the integral of the continuous function $G_{\\ell}(x)$ vanishes: $\\lim_{\\eta\\to 0} \\int_{-\\eta}^{\\eta} G_{\\ell}(x) dx = 0$.\nThe integral of the second derivative term yields a jump in the first derivative:\n$$-\\ell^2 \\int_{-\\eta}^{\\eta} \\frac{d^2G_{\\ell}}{dx^2}(x) dx = -\\ell^2 \\left[ \\frac{dG_{\\ell}}{dx} \\right]_{-\\eta}^{\\eta} = -\\ell^2 \\left( \\frac{dG_{\\ell}}{dx}(0^+) - \\frac{dG_{\\ell}}{dx}(0^-) \\right)$$\nThus, we obtain the jump condition:\n$$-\\ell^2 \\left( \\frac{dG_{\\ell}}{dx}(0^+) - \\frac{dG_{\\ell}}{dx}(0^-) \\right) = 1$$\nThe derivatives of $G_{\\ell}(x) = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|}{\\ell}\\right)$ are:\nFor $x>0$: $\\frac{dG_{\\ell}}{dx} = -\\frac{C}{\\ell} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\ell}\\right) \\implies \\frac{dG_{\\ell}}{dx}(0^+) = -\\frac{C}{\\ell}$.\nFor $x<0$: $\\frac{dG_{\\ell}}{dx} = \\frac{C}{\\ell} \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{\\ell}\\right) \\implies \\frac{dG_{\\ell}}{dx}(0^-) = \\frac{C}{\\ell}$.\nSubstituting these into the jump condition:\n$$-\\ell^2 \\left( -\\frac{C}{\\ell} - \\frac{C}{\\ell} \\right) = -\\ell^2 \\left( -\\frac{2C}{\\ell} \\right) = 2C\\ell = 1$$\nThis gives $C = \\frac{1}{2\\ell}$. The Green's function is therefore:\n$$G_{\\ell}(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\ell} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|}{\\ell}\\right)$$\nSince the operator $L$ is linear and translation-invariant, the solution to $L\\bar{\\varepsilon}(x) = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{eq}}(x)$ is given by the convolution of the source term with the Green's function. Let $u(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} G_{\\ell}(x-\\xi) \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\xi) d\\xi$. Applying $L$ to $u(x)$:\n$$L u(x) = L \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} G_{\\ell}(x-\\xi) \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\xi) d\\xi = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} L G_{\\ell}(x-\\xi) \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\xi) d\\xi$$\nBy the property of the Green's function and translational invariance, $L G_{\\ell}(x-\\xi) = \\delta(x-\\xi)$.\n$$L u(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(x-\\xi) \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\xi) d\\xi = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{eq}}(x)$$\nThus, $u(x)$ satisfies the governing differential equation. Given that it also satisfies the decay conditions at infinity (since $G_{\\ell}$ decays and $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ is localized), by uniqueness, $u(x)=\\bar{\\varepsilon}(x)$. This establishes the required convolution form:\n$$\\bar{\\varepsilon}(x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} G_{\\ell}(x-\\xi)\\,\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\xi)\\,d\\xi$$\nNow, we compute $\\bar{\\varepsilon}(0)$ for the specified rectangular source term $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{eq}}(x)$.\n$$\\bar{\\varepsilon}(0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} G_{\\ell}(0-\\xi) \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\xi) d\\xi = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} G_{\\ell}(-\\xi) \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\xi) d\\xi$$\nThe Green's function is an even function, $G_{\\ell}(-\\xi) = G_{\\ell}(\\xi)$.

All necessary parameters for a numerical solution are provided. The problem is deemed valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe solution is constructed by addressing the tasks in the specified sequence.\n\n1) Derivation of the Euler–Lagrange Equation and Natural Boundary Conditions.\n\nThe minimizer $\\kappa(x)$ of the functional $\\mathcal{J}[\\kappa]$ must satisfy the condition that the first variation $\\delta \\mathcal{J}$ vanishes for any admissible perturbation $\\delta\\kappa(x)$. The functional is given by\n$$\n\\mathcal{J}[\\kappa] = \\int_{-L}^{L} F(x, \\kappa, \\kappa') \\,\\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nwhere the integrand is $F(x, \\kappa, \\kappa') = \\frac{1}{2}(\\kappa - \\kappa_{\\mathrm{loc}})^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\ell^2(\\kappa')^2$.\n\nThe first variation is computed as\n$$\n\\delta \\mathcal{J} = \\int_{-L}^{L} \\left( \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\kappa}\\delta\\kappa + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\kappa'}\\delta\\kappa' \\right) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = 0\n$$\nThe partial derivatives of $F$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\kappa} = \\kappa - \\kappa_{\\mathrm{loc}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\kappa'} = \\ell^2 \\kappa'\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\delta\\mathcal{J}$:\n$$\n\\delta \\mathcal{J} = \\int_{-L}^{L} \\left( (\\kappa - \\kappa_{\\mathrm{loc}})\\delta\\kappa + \\ell^2\\kappa'\\delta\\kappa' \\right) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = 0\n$$\nApplying integration by parts to the second term:\n$$\n\\int_{-L}^{L} \\ell^2\\kappa'\\delta\\kappa' \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\left[ \\ell^2\\kappa'\\delta\\kappa \\right]_{-L}^{L} - \\int_{-L}^{L} (\\ell^2\\kappa'')\\delta\\kappa \\,\\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the variation equation:\n$$\n\\delta \\mathcal{J} = \\int_{-L}^{L} \\left( \\kappa - \\kappa_{\\mathrm{loc}} - \\ell^2\\kappa'' \\right) \\delta\\kappa \\,\\mathrm{d}x + \\left[ \\ell^2\\kappa'\\delta\\kappa \\right]_{-L}^{L} = 0\n$$\nFor this equation to hold for any arbitrary admissible perturbation $\\delta\\kappa$, both the integral and the boundary terms must vanish independently. From the integral term, by the fundamental lemma of calculus of variations, we obtain the Euler–Lagrange equation:\n$$\n\\kappa(x) - \\ell^2\\kappa''(x) = \\kappa_{\\mathrm{loc}}(x) \\quad \\text{for } x \\in (-L, L)\n$$\nThe boundary term provides the natural boundary conditions. As no essential (Dirichlet) conditions are imposed on $\\kappa$, the perturbations $\\delta\\kappa(\\pm L)$ are arbitrary. Thus, their coefficients must be zero:\n$$\n\\ell^2 \\kappa'(L) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -\\ell^2 \\kappa'(-L) = 0\n$$\nSince $\\ell > 0$, this implies $\\kappa'(L)=0$ and $\\kappa'(-L)=0$. The outward unit normal is $\\nu=1$ at $x=L$ and $\\nu=-1$ at $x=-L$. The condition $\\kappa'(x)\\nu = 0$ is thus satisfied at both boundaries.\n\n2) Derivation of the Weak Form.\n\nThe weak form is derived from the strong form (the Euler-Lagrange equation) by multiplying with a test function $v(x)$ from a suitable space, here $H^1(\\Omega)$, and integrating over the domain $\\Omega = [-L, L]$.\nStarting with the strong form, $-\\ell^2\\kappa'' + \\kappa = \\kappa_{\\mathrm{loc}}$:\n$$\n\\int_{-L}^{L} (-\\ell^2\\kappa'' + \\kappa) v \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{-L}^{L} \\kappa_{\\mathrm{loc}} v \\,\\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nWe apply integration by parts to the second-derivative term to reduce the order of differentiation:\n$$\n\\int_{-L}^{L} (-\\ell^2\\kappa'')v \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\left[ -\\ell^2\\kappa'v \\right]_{-L}^{L} + \\int_{-L}^{L} \\ell^2\\kappa'v' \\,\\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nThe boundary term $\\left[ -\\ell^2\\kappa'v \\right]_{-L}^{L} = -\\ell^2\\kappa'(L)v(L) + \\ell^2\\kappa'(-L)v(-L)$ is identically zero due to the homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions $\\kappa'(\\pm L)=0$. This is how the natural boundary conditions are incorporated implicitly in the weak formulation.\n\nThe resulting weak form is: find $\\kappa \\in H^1(\\Omega)$ such that for all $v \\in H^1(\\Omega)$,\n$$\n\\int_{-L}^{L} \\left(\\ell^2\\kappa'(x)v'(x) + \\kappa(x)v(x)\\right) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{-L}^{L} \\kappa_{\\mathrm{loc}}(x)v(x) \\,\\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nThis defines a bilinear form $a(\\kappa, v) = \\int_{-L}^{L} (\\ell^2\\kappa'v' + \\kappa v)\\,\\mathrm{d}x$ and a linear functional $l(v) = \\int_{-L}^{L} \\kappa_{\\mathrm{loc}}v\\,\\mathrm{d}x$. The problem $a(\\kappa, v) = l(v)$ is well-posed by the Lax-Milgram theorem, as the bilinear form is continuous and coercive on $H^1(\\Omega)$.\n\n3) Construction of the Discrete Linear System.\n\nWe discretize the domain $\\Omega = [-L, L]$ into $N$ linear finite elements of uniform size $h = 2L/N$. The solution $\\kappa(x)$ is approximated by a piecewise linear function $\\kappa_h(x) = \\sum_{j=1}^{N+1} \\kappa_j N_j(x)$, where $\\kappa_j$ are the nodal values and $N_j(x)$ are the linear \"hat\" shape functions.\nUsing the Galerkin method, we choose the test functions $v(x)$ from the same discrete space, i.e., $v(x) = N_i(x)$ for $i=1, \\dots, N+1$. Substituting the approximation for $\\kappa_h$ into the weak form gives a system of linear equations:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{N+1} \\kappa_j \\left( \\ell^2 \\int_{-L}^{L} N_i' N_j' \\,\\mathrm{d}x + \\int_{-L}^{L} N_i N_j \\,\\mathrm{d}x \\right) = \\int_{-L}^{L} \\kappa_{\\mathrm{loc}} N_i \\,\\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nThis is a linear system $A\\boldsymbol{\\kappa} = \\boldsymbol{f}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}$ is the vector of nodal unknowns $[\\kappa_1, \\dots, \\kappa_{N+1}]^T$. The system matrix $A$ is given by $A_{ij} = \\ell^2 K_{ij} + M_{ij}$, where\n- $K_{ij} = \\int_{-L}^{L} N_i'(x) N_j'(x) \\,\\mathrm{d}x$ are the entries of the global stiffness matrix $K$.\n- $M_{ij} = \\int_{-L}^{L} N_i(x) N_j(x) \\,\\mathrm{d}x$ are the entries of the global mass matrix $M$.\n\nThe matrices $K$ and $M$ are assembled by summing the contributions from each element's stiffness matrix $K_e$ and mass matrix $M_e$. For a linear element of length $h$, these are given as $K_e = \\frac{1}{h}\\begin{bmatrix}1 & -1\\\\ -1 & 1\\end{bmatrix}$ and $M_e = \\frac{h}{6}\\begin{bmatrix}2 & 1\\\\ 1 & 2\\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nThe right-hand side vector $\\boldsymbol{f}$ has components $f_i = \\int_{-L}^{L} \\kappa_{\\mathrm{loc}}(x) N_i(x) \\,\\mathrm{d}x$. As suggested, we approximate this using a consistent formulation. We approximate $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{loc}}(x)$ by its nodal interpolant, $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{loc}}(x) \\approx \\sum_{j=1}^{N+1} g_j N_j(x)$, where $g_j = \\kappa_{\\mathrm{loc}}(x_j)$ are the nodal values of the local driver. The integral becomes:\n$$\nf_i = \\int_{-L}^{L} \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{N+1} g_j N_j(x)\\right) N_i(x) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\sum_{j=1}^{N+1} M_{ij} g_j = (M\\boldsymbol{g})_i\n$$\nThus, the right-hand side vector is $\\boldsymbol{f} = M\\boldsymbol{g}$. The final discrete system is:\n$$\n(M + \\ell^2 K)\\boldsymbol{\\kappa} = M\\boldsymbol{g}\n$$\nThis system is symmetric and positive-definite, and can be solved for the nodal values $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}$.\n\n4-6) Implementation, FWHM Calculation, and Reporting.\n\nThe logic described in steps 1-3 is implemented in Python. The solver performs the following sequence for each test case:\n- Defines the mesh nodes and element size.\n- Assembles the global mass ($M$) and stiffness ($K$) matrices from the provided element matrices.\n- Constructs the nodal vector $\\boldsymbol{g}$ by sampling $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{loc}}(x)$ at the nodes.\n- Forms the system matrix $A = M + \\ell^2 K$ and the right-hand side vector $\\boldsymbol{f} = M\\boldsymbol{g}$.\n- Solves the linear system $A\\boldsymbol{\\kappa} = \\boldsymbol{f}$ to find the nodal solution $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}$.\n- Computes the maximum value of the solution, $\\kappa_{\\max} = \\max(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa})$, and the half-maximum level $\\kappa_{hm} = 0.5 \\kappa_{\\max}$.\n- Checks if the solution at the boundary, $\\kappa_h(L)$, is greater than $\\kappa_{hm}$. If so, the FWHM is set to $2L$.\n- Otherwise, it searches from the center of the domain outwards to find the element where the solution crosses the $\\kappa_{hm}$ level. Linear interpolation within this element is used to find the precise crossing coordinate $x_{cross}$. The FWHM is then $2x_{cross}$.\n- Finally, the ratio $\\mathrm{FWHM}/\\ell$ is computed and reported.\n\nThe theoretical analysis for the infinite domain case, valid for $a \\ll \\ell$ and $L \\gg \\ell$, predicts that $\\mathrm{FWHM} / \\ell = 2\\ln(2) \\approx 1.386294$.
