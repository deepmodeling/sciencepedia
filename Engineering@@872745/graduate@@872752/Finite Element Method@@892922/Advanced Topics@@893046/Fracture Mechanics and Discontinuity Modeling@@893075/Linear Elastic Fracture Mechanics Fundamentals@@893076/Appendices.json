The plate is subjected to a uniform remote tensile stress $\\sigma$ perpendicular to the crack plane. Owing to its large thickness, plane strain conditions apply in the crack-tip region. A Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis using the domain form of the path-independent $J$-integral (denoted $J$) yields a mesh-converged value for the energy release rate at the crack tip.\n\nMaterial properties and loading are:\n- Young’s modulus $E = 210\\,\\text{GPa}$,\n- Poisson’s ratio $\\nu = 0.30$,\n- Remote tensile stress $\\sigma = 120\\,\\text{MPa}$,\n- Half-crack length $a = 20\\,\\text{mm}$.\n\nThe domain integral result is $J = 3.900 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\text{N/m}$.\n\nAssume the plate is sufficiently wide that finite-width effects are negligible and the central-crack solution for an infinite plate is applicable.

For a pure Mode I loading condition, this relationship is $J = G_I$. The relationship between the energy release rate and the Mode I stress intensity factor, $K_I$, depends on the state of stress.

This exercise challenges you to look beyond classical LEFM by considering a scenario involving crack-face contact and friction, which violates the standard assumption of traction-free surfaces. By analyzing how these more realistic boundary conditions fundamentally alter the near-tip mechanics, you will develop a critical perspective on the domain of validity for the classical $K$-field and the tools used to calculate it [@problem_id:2574826].", "problem": "Consider a homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic body in plane strain containing a straight crack of length $2a$ lying on the $x$-axis with tips at $x=\\pm a$. The body is subjected at infinity to a uniform far-field compressive stress $\\sigma_{yy}=-\\sigma_0$ with $\\sigma_00$, and a uniform far-field shear stress $\\sigma_{xy}=\\tau_0$ with $\\tau_0\\ge 0$. Assume small strains and small displacements, and let the constitutive behavior be linear elasticity with Lamé parameters $\\lambda$ and $\\mu_e$ (shear modulus), so the Cauchy stress $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ and infinitesimal strain $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ satisfy the linear elastic law and the equilibrium equations without body forces. Classical Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) models a crack by imposing traction-free boundary conditions on the crack faces. In the present setting, however, the crack faces are not permitted to interpenetrate, and there is dry friction characterized by a constant Coulomb coefficient $\\mu_c0$. Accordingly, along the crack faces the following unilateral contact and friction conditions must be enforced: the normal gap $g_n\\ge 0$, the normal contact pressure $p_n\\ge 0$, the complementarity condition $p_n g_n=0$, the tangential traction $t_t$ satisfies $|t_t|\\le \\mu_c p_n$, and the tangential relative displacement $\\Delta_t$ obeys stick if $|t_t|\\mu_c p_n$ with $\\Delta_t=0$, or slip if $|t_t|=\\mu_c p_n$ with $t_t=-\\mu_c p_n\\,\\mathrm{sign}(\\dot{\\Delta}_t)$.\n\nStarting from the equilibrium equations $\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}=\\boldsymbol{0}$, the linear elastic constitutive relations, and the above boundary/contact conditions, reason about the structure of the near-tip fields and energy measures when the far-field compression $\\sigma_0$ is sufficiently large to close the crack faces over a nonzero length behind the tip, while the far-field shear $\\tau_0$ promotes sliding. In particular, assess the validity of the traction-free crack-face assumption in classical LEFM, the meaning of stress intensity factors, and the path-independence of the energy release rate integral.\n\nWhich of the following statements are true in this setting?\n\nA. If the crack faces are in contact over a finite zone behind the tip, the local boundary-value problem at the tip is no longer the traction-free crack eigenproblem; consequently, the leading-order near-tip fields are not those of the classical traction-free crack, and the classical stress intensity factors $K_I$ and $K_{II}$ cease to be well-posed descriptors unless the active contact zone shrinks to zero length at the tip.\n\nB. When Coulomb friction with coefficient $\\mu_c0$ is active on the faces, the shear stress exhibits a logarithmic singularity in radius $r$ as $r\\to 0$ at the tip, while the normal stress retains the classical $r^{-1/2}$ singularity; thus the classical mode mixity remains meaningful even under contact.\n\nC. The path-independent $J$-integral of LEFM, computed as a contour integral around the tip, remains path-independent without any correction even if the contour encloses crack-face regions carrying nonzero contact pressures and frictional tractions, provided the material is linear elastic and there are no body forces.\n\nD. Imposing the nonpenetration and Coulomb friction conditions along the crack faces converts the problem into a variational inequality. As a result, the near-tip fields may involve stick and slip subzones whose extents depend on $\\sigma_0$, $\\tau_0$, and $\\mu_c$, and the standard domain-integral extraction of $K$ from finite element method (FEM) solutions generally does not converge to a unique value under far-field compression because the underlying traction-free asymptotics are inapplicable.\n\nE. If $\\mu_c$ is sufficiently large, friction eliminates the near-tip singularity so that all stress components remain bounded as $r\\to 0$, which implies the energy release rate $G$ is identically zero for any $\\tau_0$ under far-field compression.\n\nSelect all that apply.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extracted Givens**\n- **Material and Geometry:** A homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic body in plane strain with a central straight crack of length $2a$ on the $x$-axis, with tips at $x=\\pm a$.\n- **Material Properties:** Lamé parameters $\\lambda$ and $\\mu_e$ (shear modulus), and a constant Coulomb friction coefficient $\\mu_c  0$.\n- **Loading:** Uniform far-field stresses $\\sigma_{yy}=-\\sigma_0$ with $\\sigma_00$ and $\\sigma_{xy}=\\tau_0$ with $\\tau_0\\ge 0$.\n- **Governing Equations:** Linear elastostatics, i.e., equilibrium $\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}=\\boldsymbol{0}$ and the linear elastic constitutive law $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})$.\n- **Crack Face Conditions:** These are unilateral contact and Coulomb friction conditions along the crack faces:\n    - Normal gap: $g_n\\ge 0$.\n    - Normal contact pressure: $p_n\\ge 0$.\n    - Complementarity: $p_n g_n=0$.\n    - Friction law: $|t_t|\\le \\mu_c p_n$, with stick for $|t_t|\\mu_c p_n$ ($\\Delta_t=0$) and slip for $|t_t|=\\mu_c p_n$ ($t_t=-\\mu_c p_n\\,\\mathrm{sign}(\\dot{\\Delta}_t)$).\n- **Context:** The analysis is to be performed under the assumption that far-field compression is large enough to induce a contact zone of nonzero length, and far-field shear promotes sliding.\n\n**Step 2: Validation Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly grounded in the established field of contact fracture mechanics. The model uses standard principles of continuum mechanics: linear elasticity, static equilibrium, and the well-accepted, if simplified, laws of unilateral contact and Coulomb friction.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem describes a boundary value problem that, while nonlinear due to the contact and friction constraints, is well-posed. The question asks for a qualitative assessment of the solution's structure, which is a standard inquiry in advanced mechanics.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language using standard scientific terminology. There are no subjective or ambiguous elements.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem provides a sufficient basis for reasoning about the near-tip mechanics. The assumption that $\\sigma_0$ is \"sufficiently large\" is a valid qualitative constraint that defines the physical regime of interest (a partially closed crack) without being mathematically ambiguous.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is professionally formulated, scientifically sound, and well-posed. It presents a non-trivial case from contact fracture mechanics that contrasts with the simplified assumptions of classical Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM). The problem is **valid**. We proceed to the analysis of the options.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the departure from the traction-free crack-face boundary condition, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{n}=\\boldsymbol{0}$, which underpins classical LEFM. Here, due to far-field compression, the crack faces are in contact, giving rise to normal pressure $p_n$ and frictional shear traction $t_t$. This fundamentally alters the local boundary value problem at the crack tip.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\nThis statement claims that if the crack faces are in contact over a finite zone, the classical near-tip fields and the associated stress intensity factors ($K_I$, $K_{II}$) are no longer valid descriptors. The classical singular fields of LEFM are the eigenfunctions of the problem of a semi-infinite crack with traction-free faces. The leading term in the asymptotic expansion is the familiar $r^{-1/2}$ singular field, whose amplitude is quantified by the stress intensity factors. When the crack faces carry contact Pressure ($p_n  0$) and frictional tractions ($t_t \\neq 0$), the local boundary conditions at the tip have changed. The problem is no longer the traction-free eigenproblem. Consequently, its solution, the near-tip field, will be different. The a priori assumption of an $r^{-1/2}$ singularity is not justified. In fact, analytical studies of this class of problems show that the singularity is generally not of the form $r^{-1/2}$. Since the classical SIFs are defined specifically as the coefficients of the classical $r^{-1/2}$ fields, they cease to be well-posed or meaningful quantities in this context. They would only regain their meaning if the contact zone receded from the tip, restoring the traction-free condition in the limit.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\nThis statement claims a specific form for the near-tip singularities: a logarithmic singularity for shear stress and the classical $r^{-1/2}$ for normal stress. This is factually incorrect. Research in contact fracture mechanics (e.g., Comninou, 1977) shows that for a closed crack under shear, a classical $r^{-1/2}$ singularity is inadmissible as it leads to interpenetration of the crack faces near the tip. The actual singularity is more complex, often of an oscillatory form $r^{-1/2+i\\epsilon}$, where $\\epsilon$ is a real constant dependent on material properties. With friction, the singularity power is further modified and depends on the friction coefficient $\\mu_c$. A logarithmic singularity, being weaker than any power-law singularity of the form $r^{-p}$ with $p0$, would not represent the leading-order term. Furthermore, the compressive loading and non-penetration condition suppress the classical Mode I singularity; the normal stress ahead of the tip is indeed singular, but it is not the classical $K_I$-field. The statement is a collection of incorrect assertions.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThis statement asserts that the path-independent $J$-integral of LEFM remains path-independent even with contact and friction on the crack faces. The path-independence of the $J$-integral, $J = \\int_{\\Gamma} (W n_1 - T_i u_{i,1}) \\, dS$, relies on the divergence of its integrand vector field being zero within the area enclosed by the integration contour. When considering two contours $\\Gamma_1$ and $\\Gamma_2$, this property holds in the bulk material if it is homogeneous and elastic. However, path-independence requires that the integral over any internal boundaries, such as crack faces, also vanishes or is properly accounted for. For the standard $J$-integral, this is only true if the crack faces are traction-free. When frictional tractions $t_t$ are present, they perform work during sliding. Friction is a dissipative, non-conservative process. The term $\\int T_i u_{i,1} dS$ integrated along the crack faces between two contours $\\Gamma_1$ and $\\Gamma_2$ will be non-zero, representing the work done by frictional forces. This breaks the path-independence of the standard $J$-integral. A path-independent integral can be formulated, but it requires including an additional term that accounts for the work of frictional tractions on the crack faces. The statement as given is false.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nThis statement makes three correct assertions.\n1.  **Variational Inequality:** The problem involves unilateral constraints of the form $g_n \\ge 0$, $p_n \\ge 0$, with the complementarity condition $p_n g_n = 0$. Such problems are a classical example of what is mathematically formulated as a variational inequality, where one seeks to minimize an energy functional over a constrained (convex) set of admissible fields. This is a more general and appropriate framework than the variational principles for unconstrained linear elasticity.\n2.  **Stick and Slip Subzones:** The Coulomb friction law, $|t_t| \\le \\mu_c p_n$, naturally partitions the contact area into regions where the faces stick together (inequality holds strictly, $|t_t|  \\mu_c p_n$) and regions where they slide (equality holds, $|t_t| = \\mu_c p_n$). The sizes and locations of these subzones are part of the solution and depend on the loading parameters $\\sigma_0$, $\\tau_0$ and the material property $\\mu_c$.\n3.  **FEM Extraction of K:** Standard numerical techniques for extracting SIFs, such as the domain integral method, are based on an interaction integral between the computed Finite Element solution and the known analytical asymptotic field for a traction-free crack. As established in the analysis of option A, this underlying asymptotic field is not present in the solution to the contact problem. Therefore, the theoretical foundation of these extraction methods is invalid. Applying them will not yield a physically meaningful, unique, or convergent value corresponding to a classical SIF.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Analysis of Option E:**\nThis statement claims that a sufficiently large friction coefficient $\\mu_c$ can eliminate the stress singularity at the tip, leading to a zero energy release rate $G$. While high friction does increase the resistance to sliding, it does not remove the stress singularity. As $\\mu_c \\to \\infty$, the frictional condition approaches a no-slip (stick) condition. The problem then becomes one of a crack whose faces are bonded against relative shear displacement, but not against opening. Even in this limiting case, or for a crack along a bonded bimaterial interface, a stress singularity exists. For any finite $\\mu_c$, slip will always occur in a small region near the tip because the shear stress (driven by the far-field $\\tau_0$) tends to be singular, while the contact pressure required to prevent slip ($t_t/\\mu_c$) has a different structure. Since a stress singularity persists, the strain energy density is singular, and the energy release rate $G$, which quantifies the energy funneling into the crack tip, is non-zero as long as there is a driving force for propagation (i.e., for $\\tau_00$).\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2574826"}]}
