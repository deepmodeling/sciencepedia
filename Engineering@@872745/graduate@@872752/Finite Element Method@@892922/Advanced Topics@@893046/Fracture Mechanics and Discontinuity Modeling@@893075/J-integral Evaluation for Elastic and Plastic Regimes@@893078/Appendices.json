We shall proceed by systematically analyzing the provided foundational facts. The solution is structured into three parts as requested.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the strain energy density, $w$, for the two-dimensional cases of plane stress and plane strain, starting from the three-dimensional constitutive law. The strain energy density is given by $w=\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_{ij}\\varepsilon_{ij}$. For a two-dimensional problem in the $x_1-x_2$ plane, the stress components $\\sigma_{13}$ and $\\sigma_{23}$ are zero. Consequently, the corresponding shear strains $\\varepsilon_{13}$ and $\\varepsilon_{23}$ are also zero. The expression for $w$ thus simplifies to:\n$$\nw = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sigma_{11}\\varepsilon_{11} + \\sigma_{22}\\varepsilon_{22} + \\sigma_{33}\\varepsilon_{33} + 2\\sigma_{12}\\varepsilon_{12})\n$$\nThe provided isotropic linear elastic constitutive law is $\\varepsilon_{ij}=\\frac{1+\\nu}{E}\\sigma_{ij}-\\frac{\\nu}{E}\\sigma_{kk}\\delta_{ij}$, where $\\sigma_{kk} = \\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22} + \\sigma_{33}$.\n\nCase 1: Plane Stress ($\\sigma_{33}=0$)\n\nUnder the condition of plane stress, $\\sigma_{33}=0$. The trace of the stress tensor becomes $\\sigma_{kk} = \\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22}$. The in-plane strain components are then:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{11} = \\frac{1+\\nu}{E}\\sigma_{11} - \\frac{\\nu}{E}(\\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22}) = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_{11} - \\nu\\sigma_{22})\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{22} = \\frac{1+\\nu}{E}\\sigma_{22} - \\frac{\\nu}{E}(\\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22}) = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_{22} - \\nu\\sigma_{11})\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{12} = \\frac{1+\\nu}{E}\\sigma_{12}\n$$\nSince $\\sigma_{33}=0$, the term $\\sigma_{33}\\varepsilon_{33}$ in the expression for $w$ vanishes.

From the constitutive law for the normal strain in the $x_3$ direction:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{33} = \\frac{1+\\nu}{E}\\sigma_{33} - \\frac{\\nu}{E}(\\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22} + \\sigma_{33}) = 0\n$$\nSolving for $\\sigma_{33}$ provides the out-of-plane stress required to maintain the zero-strain condition:\n$$\n(1+\\nu)\\sigma_{33} - \\nu\\sigma_{33} = \\nu(\\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22}) \\implies \\sigma_{33} = \\nu(\\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22})\n$$\nThe trace of the stress tensor becomes $\\sigma_{kk} = \\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22} + \\nu(\\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22}) = (1+\\nu)(\\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22})$. The in-plane strain components are:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{11} = \\frac{1}{E}[\\sigma_{11} - \\nu(\\sigma_{22} + \\sigma_{33})] = \\frac{1}{E}[\\sigma_{11} - \\nu\\sigma_{22} - \\nu^2(\\sigma_{11}+\\sigma_{22})] = \\frac{1}{E}[(1-\\nu^2)\\sigma_{11} - \\nu(1+\\nu)\\sigma_{22}]\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{22} = \\frac{1}{E}[\\sigma_{22} - \\nu(\\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{33})] = \\frac{1}{E}[\\sigma_{22} - \\nu\\sigma_{11} - \\nu^2(\\sigma_{11}+\\sigma_{22})] = \\frac{1}{E}[(1-\\nu^2)\\sigma_{22} - \\nu(1+\\nu)\\sigma_{11}]\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{12} = \\frac{1+\\nu}{E}\\sigma_{12}\n$$\nSince $\\varepsilon_{33}=0$, the term $\\sigma_{33}\\varepsilon_{33}$ in the expression for $w$ vanishes.

The $J$-integral is obtained by evaluating the integral $J=\\int_{\\Gamma}(w\\,n_{1}-\\sigma_{ij}n_{j}u_{i,1})\\,\\mathrm{d}s$ using the near-tip fields. The stress field is given as $\\sigma_{ij} = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} f_{ij}(\\theta)$, which is independent of elastic constants for a given $K_I$. The displacement field $u_i$ is obtained by integrating the strains $\\varepsilon_{ij}$, which depend linearly on the stresses through the compliance. Thus, both terms in the $J$-integral integrand, $w$ and $\\sigma_{ij}n_j u_{i,1}$, will scale quadratically with $K_I$ and linearly with the material compliance. This structural dependence implies $J$ is of the form $J = C K_I^2$, where the constant $C$ embodies the material properties. We define an effective modulus $E'$ such that $J = K_I^2/E'$.\n\nFor plane stress, the strains are $\\varepsilon_{ij} \\propto \\frac{1}{E}$. Consequently, the displacements $u_i \\propto \\frac{1}{E}$ and the strain energy density $w_{\\text{ps}} \\propto \\frac{1}{E}$. The entire $J$-integral expression must therefore be proportional to $\\frac{1}{E}$.\n$$\nJ_{\\text{ps}} \\propto \\frac{K_I^2}{E}\n$$\nBy comparing this with $J=K_I^2/E'$, the effective modulus for plane stress is identified as:\n$$\nE'_{\\text{ps}} = E\n$$\n\nFor plane strain, observe the in-plane stress-strain relations:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{11} = \\frac{1-\\nu^2}{E}\\left(\\sigma_{11} - \\frac{\\nu}{1-\\nu}\\sigma_{22}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{22} = \\frac{1-\\nu^2}{E}\\left(\\sigma_{22} - \\frac{\\nu}{1-\\nu}\\sigma_{11}\\right)\n$$\nThese relations have the same structure as the plane stress equations if we perform the substitutions $E \\to E/(1-\\nu^2)$ and $\\nu \\to \\nu/(1-\\nu)$. Since the near-tip stress field is the same for a given $K_I$ in both cases, the entire derivation of the $J-K_I$ relationship for plane strain must follow from the plane stress result by applying this substitution. The scaling factor for compliance is now $\\frac{1-\\nu^2}{E}$ instead of $\\frac{1}{E}$.\n$$\nJ_{\\text{pe}} \\propto \\frac{(1-\\nu^2)K_I^2}{E}\n$$\nThis implies that the effective modulus for plane strain is:\n$$\nE'_{\\text{pe}} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\n$$\n\nThird, we report the final expressions for $J$ as a function of $K_I$, $E$, and $\\nu$. Utilizing the standard relationship $J=K_I^2/E'$ and the effective moduli derived above, we obtain the two required expressions.\n\nFor plane stress:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{ps}} = \\frac{K_I^2}{E'_{\\text{ps}}} = \\frac{K_I^2}{E}\n$$\nFor plane strain:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{pe}} = \\frac{K_I^2}{E'_{\\text{pe}}} = \\frac{K_I^2}{E/(1-\\nu^2)} = \\frac{(1-\\nu^2)K_I^2}{E}\n$$\nThese are the canonical relationships between the $J$-integral and the Mode I stress intensity factor in linear elastic fracture mechanics.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{K_I^2}{E}  \\frac{(1-\\nu^2)K_I^2}{E} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2571466"}, {"introduction": "While theoretical formulas provide exact relationships, engineering analysis often relies on numerical methods like the Finite Element Method (FEM), which introduce discretization errors.

This effective energy release rate, $J_{\\text{eff}}$, is therefore less than the J-integral evaluated on a remote contour, $J_{\\text{remote}}$.\n\nThe relationship is given by:\n$$J_{\\text{eff}} = J_{\\text{remote}} - J_{\\text{face}}$$\nwhere $J_{\\text{face}}$ is a positive term representing the energy absorption rate due to the contact tractions. For the specific conditions of this problem, this term is calculated as $J_{\\text{face}} = \\alpha p_0 l_c$. This formula arises from integrating the product of the contact pressure and the virtual displacement gradient over the contact area.\n\nLet's first calculate the numerical value of this shielding term, which is the same for both the elastic and elastic-plastic cases:\n$$J_{\\text{face}} = (5 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (40 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{Pa}) \\times (5 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{m}) = 1000 \\, \\text{N/m}$$\n\nNow we evaluate the remote J-integral for each case.\n\n**Linear Elastic Case:**\nFor the traction-free case, the remote J-integral, $J_{\\mathrm{TF}}$, is equal to the energy release rate $G$. We first calculate the stress intensity factors:\n$$K_I = \\sigma_\\infty\\sqrt{\\pi a} = (50\\times 10^{6}) \\sqrt{\\pi \\times 0.05} \\approx 19.817 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{Pa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}}$$\n$$K_{II} = \\tau_\\infty\\sqrt{\\pi a} = (30\\times 10^{6}) \\sqrt{\\pi \\times 0.05} \\approx 11.890 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{Pa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}}$$\nFor plane stress, the energy release rate is:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{TF}} = \\frac{K_I^2 + K_{II}^2}{E} = \\frac{(19.817 \\times 10^6)^2 + (11.890 \\times 10^6)^2}{210 \\times 10^9}$$\n$$J_{\\mathrm{TF}} = \\frac{3.927 \\times 10^{14} + 1.414 \\times 10^{14}}{2.1 \\times 10^{11}} = \\frac{5.341 \\times 10^{14}}{2.1 \\times 10^{11}} \\approx 2543 \\, \\text{N/m}$$\nThis value is the remote J-integral.\n\n**Elastic-Plastic Case:**\nThe problem states that the remote J-integral, evaluated from the FEM domain integral for the case with contact, is $J_{\\text{remote}} = J_{\\mathrm{dom,EP}}=3744$ N/m.\n\nWith these values, we can evaluate the provided options.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In the linear elastic case with traction-free faces, the energy release rate is $J_{\\mathrm{TF}}=\\dfrac{K_I^2+K_{II}^2}{E}$, which evaluates to approximately $2543$ N/m for the given data. With the specified compressive contact, the crack-face term contributes $J_{\\mathrm{face}}=\\alpha\\,p_0\\,l_c=1000$ N/m, so the effective $J$ reduces to $J_{\\mathrm{C}}=J_{\\mathrm{TF}}-J_{\\mathrm{face}}\\approx 1543$ N/m.**\nOur calculation for the traction-free case gives $J_{\\mathrm{TF}} \\approx 2543$ N/m. The crack-face term is correctly calculated as $J_{\\text{face}} = 1000$ N/m. The effective J-integral with contact is $J_{\\mathrm{C}} = J_{\\mathrm{TF}} - J_{\\text{face}} = 2543 - 1000 = 1543$ N/m. This statement is entirely correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Because the $J$-integral is path independent, crack-face tractions never contribute to $J$. Therefore, $J$ is unchanged by contact and remains $2543$ N/m in the linear elastic case.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. The path independence of the $J$-integral holds only under specific conditions, which include the absence of tractions on the crack faces within the integration contour. When crack faces are loaded, the energy release rate at the tip is certainly affected.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. In the elastic-plastic Ramberg–Osgood case with the reported FEM area-integral $J_{\\mathrm{dom,EP}}=3744$ N/m on the same outer ring for both traction-free and contact models, the same compressive contact field reduces the effective $J$ by $1000$ N/m, giving $J_{\\mathrm{EP,C}}=2744$ N/m.**\nThe remote J-integral is given as $J_{\\mathrm{dom,EP}}=3744$ N/m. The shielding contribution is the same, $J_{\\text{face}} = 1000$ N/m. The effective J-integral is $J_{\\mathrm{EP,C}} = J_{\\text{remote}} - J_{\\text{face}} = 3744 - 1000 = 2744$ N/m. The statement is correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. In frictionless unilateral contact, the crack-face traction term does positive work on a virtual crack extension and therefore increases $J$ by $1000$ N/m relative to traction-free faces in both linear elastic and elastic-plastic cases.**\nCompressive contact provides shielding, which reduces the crack driving force. The term must be subtracted, not added. This statement is physically and mathematically incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2571456"}]}
