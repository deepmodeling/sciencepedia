It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics and the Finite Element Method, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is formulated with objective, unambiguous language. The tasks constitute a standard verification exercise in computational fracture mechanics. We may thus proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the evaluation of two types of error for two different isoparametric mappings of a quadratic line element used to model the near-tip displacement field on a crack face. The analysis can be generalized before application to the specific test cases.\n\nLet us begin by defining the material constants from the given Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$:\nThe shear modulus $\\mu$ is given by\n$$ \\mu = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)} $$\nThe Kolosov constant $\\kappa$ for plane strain is\n$$ \\kappa = 3 - 4\\nu $$\nThe analytical displacement on the upper crack face $(\\theta = \\pi)$ is $u_y^+(r) = C \\sqrt{r}$, where the constant $C$ is defined as\n$$ C = \\frac{K_I}{2 \\mu} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2 \\pi}} (\\kappa + 1) $$\nHere, $K_I$ is the Mode I Stress Intensity Factor.\n\nThe finite element approximation uses three-node quadratic Lagrange shape functions:\n$N_1(\\xi) = \\frac{1}{2}\\xi(\\xi-1)$, $N_5(\\xi) = 1-\\xi^2$, and $N_2(\\xi) = \\frac{1}{2}\\xi(\\xi+1)$.\nThe geometry $r(\\xi)$ and displacement $u_h(\\xi)$ are interpolated isoparametrically:\n$$ r(\\xi) = N_1(\\xi) r_1 + N_5(\\xi) r_5 + N_2(\\xi) r_2 $$\n$$ u_h(\\xi) = N_1(\\xi) u_1 + N_5(\\xi) u_5 + N_2(\\xi) u_2 $$\nThe nodal coordinates are defined with respect to the element length $L$, with the crack tip at $r_1=0$. The nodal displacements are set from the analytical solution: $u_1 = C\\sqrt{r_1}$, $u_5 = C\\sqrt{r_5}$, $u_2 = C\\sqrt{r_2}$. Since $r_1=0$, it follows that $u_1=0$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the quarter-point mapping, for which the nodal coordinates are $r_1=0$, $r_5=L/4$, and $r_2=L$. The geometric mapping is:\n$$ r(\\xi) = N_1(\\xi)(0) + N_5(\\xi)\\frac{L}{4} + N_2(\\xi)L = (1-\\xi^2)\\frac{L}{4} + \\frac{1}{2}\\xi(\\xi+1)L $$\n$$ r(\\xi) = \\frac{L}{4} (1-\\xi^2 + 2\\xi(\\xi+1)) = \\frac{L}{4} (1-\\xi^2 + 2\\xi^2 + 2\\xi) = \\frac{L}{4} (1 + 2\\xi + \\xi^2) = \\frac{L}{4}(1+\\xi)^2 $$\nThe exact displacement at a parametric location $\\xi$ is $u_{\\text{ex}}(\\xi) = C\\sqrt{r(\\xi)}$. Substituting the mapping gives:\n$$ u_{\\text{ex}}(\\xi) = C \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{4}(1+\\xi)^2} = \\frac{C\\sqrt{L}}{2}(1+\\xi) $$\nNow, we evaluate the finite element interpolation $u_h(\\xi)$. The nodal displacements are $u_1 = 0$, $u_5 = C\\sqrt{L/4} = C\\sqrt{L}/2$, and $u_2 = C\\sqrt{L}$.\n$$ u_h(\\xi) = N_1(\\xi)(0) + N_5(\\xi)\\frac{C\\sqrt{L}}{2} + N_2(\\xi)C\\sqrt{L} = C\\sqrt{L} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(1-\\xi^2) + \\frac{1}{2}\\xi(\\xi+1) \\right) $$\n$$ u_h(\\xi) = \\frac{C\\sqrt{L}}{2} (1-\\xi^2 + \\xi^2+\\xi) = \\frac{C\\sqrt{L}}{2}(1+\\xi) $$\nWe find that $u_h(\\xi) = u_{\\text{ex}}(\\xi)$ for all $\\xi \\in [-1,1]$. This is a fundamental property of the quarter-point element: it exactly reproduces the $\\sqrt{r}$ singularity behavior along its edge. Consequently, the approximation error $(u_h(\\xi) - u_{\\text{ex}}(\\xi))$ is identically zero for all sample points. Therefore, the relative discrete $L^2$-error for the quarter-point mapping must be zero:\n$$ e_{L^2}^{\\text{qp}} = 0 $$\n\nNext, we analyze the error in the estimated Stress Intensity Factor, $e_K$. The estimation formula is:\n$$ K_{\\text{est}} = \\frac{\\delta \\mu \\sqrt{2\\pi}}{(\\kappa+1)\\sqrt{r_m}} $$\nwhere $\\delta = 2 u_h(0)$ and $r_m = r(0)$. At the midside location $\\xi=0$, the shape functions are $N_1(0)=0$, $N_5(0)=1$, and $N_2(0)=0$.\nThis gives $r_m = r(0) = r_5$ and $u_h(0) = u_5$.\nThe crack opening is $\\delta = 2u_5$. Substituting these into the $K_{\\text{est}}$ formula:\n$$ K_{\\text{est}} = \\frac{(2u_5) \\mu \\sqrt{2\\pi}}{(\\kappa+1)\\sqrt{r_5}} $$\nThe nodal displacement $u_5$ is prescribed from the analytical solution, $u_5 = C\\sqrt{r_5}$. Substituting this and the definition of $C$:\n$$ K_{\\text{est}} = \\frac{2 \\left( \\frac{K_I}{2 \\mu} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2 \\pi}} (\\kappa + 1) \\sqrt{r_5} \\right) \\mu \\sqrt{2\\pi}}{(\\kappa+1)\\sqrt{r_5}} $$\nThe terms algebraically cancel:\n$$ K_{\\text{est}} = \\frac{2 K_I (\\kappa+1) \\sqrt{r_5} \\mu \\sqrt{2\\pi}}{2 \\mu \\sqrt{2\\pi} (\\kappa+1) \\sqrt{r_5}} = K_I $$\nThis result holds regardless of the position of the midside node, $r_5$. It applies to both the standard mapping ($r_5 = L/2$) and the quarter-point mapping ($r_5 = L/4$). The method of estimating $K_I$ is tautological given that the nodal displacements are set from the analytical solution. Thus, the relative error $e_K = |K_{\\text{est}} - K_I|/K_I$ is zero for both mappings:\n$$ e_{K}^{\\text{std}} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad e_{K}^{\\text{qp}} = 0 $$\n\nFinally, we analyze the $L^2$-error for the standard non-singular mapping, where $r_1=0$, $r_5=L/2$, and $r_2=L$. The geometric mapping is:\n$$ r(\\xi) = (1-\\xi^2)\\frac{L}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\xi(\\xi+1)L = \\frac{L}{2}(1-\\xi^2 + \\xi^2+\\xi) = \\frac{L}{2}(1+\\xi) $$\nThe exact displacement is $u_{\\text{ex}}(\\xi) = C\\sqrt{r(\\xi)} = C\\sqrt{\\frac{L}{2}(1+\\xi)}$.\nThe nodal displacements are $u_1=0$, $u_5=C\\sqrt{L/2}$, $u_2=C\\sqrt{L}$. The interpolation is:\n$$ u_h(\\xi) = u_5 N_5(\\xi) + u_2 N_2(\\xi) = C\\sqrt{L/2}\\,(1-\\xi^2) + C\\sqrt{L}\\,\\frac{1}{2}\\xi(\\xi+1) $$\n$$ u_h(\\xi) = C\\sqrt{L} \\left( \\frac{1-\\xi^2}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{\\xi(\\xi+1)}{2} \\right) $$\nUnlike the quarter-point case, $u_h(\\xi)$ is not equal to $u_{\\text{ex}}(\\xi)$. We must compute the relative error:\n$$ e_{L^2}^{\\text{std}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{\\xi \\in \\Xi} \\left(u_h(\\xi) - u_{\\text{ex}}(\\xi)\\right)^2}{\\sum_{\\xi \\in \\Xi} u_{\\text{ex}}(\\xi)^2}} $$\nNotice that both $u_h(\\xi)$ and $u_{\\text{ex}}(\\xi)$ are proportional to the factor $C\\sqrt{L}$. This factor cancels from the numerator and denominator of the relative error expression. Thus, $e_{L^2}^{\\text{std}}$ is a constant value independent of $E, \\nu, K_I, L$. We calculate this value for the sample points $\\Xi = [-0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.8]$.\nLet us define normalized displacements $\\tilde{u}_h(\\xi) = u_h(\\xi)/(C\\sqrt{L})$ and $\\tilde{u}_{\\text{ex}}(\\xi) = u_{\\text{ex}}(\\xi)/(C\\sqrt{L})$.\n$$ \\tilde{u}_{\\text{ex}}(\\xi) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\xi}{2}} $$\n$$ \\tilde{u}_h(\\xi) = \\frac{1-\\xi^2}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{\\xi(\\xi+1)}{2} $$\nWe evaluate the sums for $\\xi \\in \\Xi$:\n- For $\\xi = -0.5$: $\\tilde{u}_{\\text{ex}} = \\sqrt{0.25} = 0.5$, $\\tilde{u}_h = \\frac{0.75}{\\sqrt{2}} - 0.125 \\approx 0.40533$.\n- For $\\xi = 0.0$: $\\tilde{u}_{\\text{ex}} = \\sqrt{0.5} \\approx 0.70711$, $\\tilde{u}_h = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 0.70711$.

In this practice, you will implement a Gaussian quadrature routine to evaluate a singular domain integral over both a standard and a quarter-point element. This will provide direct, hands-on insight into how the Jacobian of the quarter-point mapping elegantly cancels the integrand's singularity, making accurate numerical evaluation possible with standard methods. [@problem_id:2602837]", "problem": "You are tasked with implementing an element-level Gaussian quadrature procedure to evaluate a domain integral appearing in the computation of Stress Intensity Factors (SIF) within the Finite Element Method (FEM). The evaluation must be performed in isoparametric elements, with correct handling of elements employing a quarter-point mapping at a crack tip. Your program will compute a singular, yet integrable, domain integral that serves as a proxy for the singular kernel arising in the domain form of path-independent integrals used for SIF extraction.\n\nStart from a fundamental base appropriate for advanced computations of crack-tip fields in linear elasticity:\n- Conservation of energy and the definition of the energy release rate, which undergirds the path-independent crack integrals.\n- The divergence theorem, justifying conversion of line integrals into domain integrals.\n- The near-tip asymptotic nature of fields in linear elastic fracture mechanics, which implies singular integrands in the vicinity of the crack tip, and motivates special isoparametric mappings.\n\nYou must not use any prepackaged or shortcut SIF formulas. Instead, your implementation should be based on the following principles:\n- The isoparametric mapping from a square reference domain with local coordinates $(\\xi,\\eta)\\in[-1,1]^2$ to a physical element.\n- Gaussian quadrature to evaluate an area integral by sampling the integrand at quadrature points in the reference domain and multiplying by the determinant of the Jacobian of the isoparametric mapping.\n- The need for special treatment for elements with quarter-point mapping near a crack tip, where mid-side nodes on edges emanating from the crack tip are shifted to quarter points so that the mapping reproduces the correct square-root singularity in strain fields and regularizes the composite integrand-with-Jacobian for numerical integration.\n\nTarget integral to evaluate:\n- Define the crack tip to be located at the origin in Cartesian coordinates. Let $r=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ denote the distance to the crack tip. Consider the scalar function $g(x,y)=r^{-1/2}$, which captures, in a surrogate sense, the algebraic singularity structure relevant to crack-tip energies.\n- For a given physical rectangular element of size $L$ (in the $x$-direction) and $H$ (half-height in the $y$-direction), aligned such that the crack lies along the $x$-axis and the crack tip is at the left edge at $x=0$, define the physical domain for a single element as $\\Omega=\\{(x,y): 0\\le x\\le L,\\ -H\\le y\\le H\\}$.\n- The integral to evaluate is the domain integral\n$$\nI(L,H)=\\iint_{\\Omega} g(x,y)\\,d\\Omega=\\iint_{\\Omega} r^{-1/2}\\,dx\\,dy.\n$$\nThis integral has units of $\\mathrm{m}^{3/2}$ when $L$ and $H$ are expressed in meters.\n\nElement types and mappings:\n- Case A uses a $4$-node bilinear isoparametric quadrilateral (commonly denoted Q4) mapping the reference square to $\\Omega$ with corner nodes at $(0,-H)$, $(L,-H)$, $(L,H)$, $(0,H)$.\n- Case B and Case C use an $8$-node serendipity isoparametric quadrilateral (commonly denoted Q8) with quarter-point placement to model a crack tip: the tip is located at the mid-side node on the left edge. The physical coordinates of the $8$ nodes (ordered in the standard serendipity convention with mid-side nodes) are:\n    - Node $1$: $(0,-H)$ at $(\\xi,\\eta)=(-1,-1)$,\n    - Node $2$: $(L,-H)$ at $(\\xi,\\eta)=(1,-1)$,\n    - Node $3$: $(L,H)$ at $(\\xi,\\eta)=(1,1)$,\n    - Node $4$: $(0,H)$ at $(\\xi,\\eta)=(-1,1)$,\n    - Node $5$: $(L/4,-H)$ at $(\\xi,\\eta)=(0,-1)$ (bottom edge mid-side shifted to quarter point),\n    - Node $6$: $(L,0)$ at $(\\xi,\\eta)=(1,0)$ (right edge mid-side),\n    - Node $7$: $(L/4,H)$ at $(\\xi,\\eta)=(0,1)$ (top edge mid-side shifted to quarter point),\n    - Node $8$: $(0,0)$ at $(\\xi,\\eta)=(-1,0)$ (left edge mid-side at the crack tip).\nThis quarter-point mapping emulates the square-root behavior of crack-tip fields by causing the physical radial coordinate to scale quadratically with a reference coordinate along edges emanating from the tip.\n\nQuadrature and algorithmic requirements:\n- Use tensor-product Gaussian quadrature of order $n$ per direction on the reference square for each element. At each quadrature point $(\\xi_i,\\eta_j)$ with weights $(w_i,w_j)$:\n    1. Evaluate isoparametric shape functions and their derivatives to compute the physical coordinates $(x,y)$ and the Jacobian matrix $J(\\xi,\\eta)$.\n    2. Compute the determinant $\\det J(\\xi,\\eta)$.\n    3. Evaluate $g(x,y)=\\left(x^2+y^2\\right)^{-1/4}$ taking care to avoid division by zero by a suitable limiting treatment at $r=0$.\n    4. Accumulate the contribution $g(x,y)\\,\\det J(\\xi,\\eta)\\,w_i\\,w_j$.\n- Ensure all computations are in the International System of Units (SI), with $L$ and $H$ in meters and the integral $I$ reported in $\\mathrm{m}^{3/2}$.\n\nSpecial treatment justification:\n- Explain, in your approach, why the quarter-point mapping is necessary near a crack tip for accurate numerical integration of singular fields, and how it alters the Jacobian to regularize the integrand in the reference space.\n\nTest suite and required output:\n- Implement and evaluate the integral $I(L,H)$ for the following three test cases:\n    1. Case A (baseline, standard isoparametric Q4): $L=1.0, H=0.5$, quadrature order $n=8$.\n    2. Case B (quarter-point isoparametric Q8): $L=1.0, H=0.5$, quadrature order $n=8$.\n    3. Case C (quarter-point isoparametric Q8, smaller domain and higher resolution): $L=0.1, H=0.05$, quadrature order $n=16$.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example, \"[result1,result2,result3]\". Each result must be a floating-point number representing $I(L,H)$ in $\\mathrm{m}^{3/2}$ for the corresponding test case, using standard decimal notation with no units in the text output. Internally, you must work consistently in SI units.\n\nDeliverables:\n- A complete, runnable program that implements the above, adheres to the specified quadrature and isoparametric mappings, computes the three requested integrals, and outputs them exactly in the specified single-line format.", "solution": "The problem requires the numerical evaluation of a singular domain integral, a task frequently encountered in computational fracture mechanics for the calculation of stress intensity factors using domain-based conservation integrals like the J-integral. The integral is defined as:\n$$\nI(L,H) = \\iint_{\\Omega} g(x,y)\\,d\\Omega = \\iint_{\\Omega} (x^2+y^2)^{-1/4}\\,dx\\,dy\n$$\nThe function $g(x,y) = r^{-1/2} = (x^2+y^2)^{-1/4}$, where $r = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ is the radial distance from the origin, possesses a singularity at the crack tip located at $(0,0)$. This singularity is integrable, as a change to polar coordinates reveals an integrand of the form $r^{-1/2} \\cdot r \\,dr\\,d\\theta = r^{1/2}\\,dr\\,d\\theta$, which is finite at $r=0$. However, standard numerical quadrature schemes perform poorly on singular integrands. The solution is to use an isoparametric mapping from a regular reference domain, the square $(\\xi,\\eta) \\in [-1,1]^2$, to the physical element domain $\\Omega$.\n\nThe integral transforms as:\n$$\nI = \\iint_{\\Omega} g(x,y)\\,dx\\,dy = \\int_{-1}^{1}\\int_{-1}^{1} g\\left(x(\\xi,\\eta), y(\\xi,\\eta)\\right) \\det[J(\\xi,\\eta)] \\,d\\xi\\,d\\eta\n$$\nwhere $J(\\xi,\\eta)$ is the Jacobian matrix of the mapping $(x,y) = \\mathbf{X}(\\xi,\\eta)$. This transformed integral is then approximated using a tensor-product Gaussian quadrature rule:\n$$\nI \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} w_i w_j g\\left(x(\\xi_i,\\eta_j), y(\\xi_i,\\eta_j)\\right) \\det[J(\\xi_i,\\eta_j)]\n$$\nHere, $(\\xi_i, \\eta_j)$ are the quadrature points and $(w_i, w_j)$ are the corresponding weights for an order-$n$ rule. The core of the problem lies in the formulation of the mapping $\\mathbf{X}(\\xi,\\eta)$ and its Jacobian. The mapping is defined using shape functions $N_k(\\xi,\\eta)$ and nodal coordinates $(x_k, y_k)$:\n$$\nx(\\xi,\\eta) = \\sum_{k} N_k(\\xi,\\eta) x_k \\quad , \\quad y(\\xi,\\eta) = \\sum_{k} N_k(\\xi,\\eta) y_k\n$$\nThe Jacobian matrix components are computed as:\n$$\nJ = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\xi} & \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\xi} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\eta} & \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\eta} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sum_k \\frac{\\partial N_k}{\\partial \\xi} x_k & \\sum_k \\frac{\\partial N_k}{\\partial \\xi} y_k \\\\ \\sum_k \\frac{\\partial N_k}{\\partial \\eta} x_k & \\sum_k \\frac{\\partial N_k}{\\partial \\eta} y_k \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe analyze each case as specified.\n\nCase A: $4$-Node Bilinear Quadrilateral (Q4)\nFor the specified physical corner nodes $(0,-H), (L,-H), (L,H), (0,H)$, the standard Q4 isoparametric mapping from $(\\xi,\\eta) \\in [-1,1]^2$ simplifies to:\n$$\nx(\\xi,\\eta) = \\frac{L}{2}(1+\\xi) \\quad , \\quad y(\\xi,\\eta) = H\\eta\n$$\nThe Jacobian matrix is constant and diagonal:\n$$\nJ = \\begin{pmatrix} L/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & H \\end{pmatrix} \\implies \\det(J) = \\frac{LH}{2}\n$$\nThe integrand in the reference space is $g \\det(J) = \\left( (\\frac{L}{2}(1+\\xi))^2 + (H\\eta)^2 \\right)^{-1/4} \\frac{LH}{2}$. The singularity of $g$ at the physical origin $(0,0)$ is mapped to the point $(\\xi,\\eta)=(-1,0)$ on the boundary of the reference domain. Standard Gauss-Legendre quadrature points lie in $(-1,1)$, so division by zero is not encountered, but the integrand varies sharply near this point, compromising the accuracy of the quadrature for low orders.\n\nCases B and C: $8$-Node Serendipity Quadrilateral (Q8) with Quarter-Point Mapping\nThis configuration is designed specifically to handle the crack-tip singularity. The crack tip is located at node $8$ with physical coordinate $(0,0)$ and reference coordinate $(\\xi,\\eta)=(-1,0)$. The crucial feature is the placement of mid-side nodes $5$ and $7$ at the quarter-points of the top and bottom physical edges ($x=L/4$), rather than the mid-points ($x=L/2$).\n\nJustification for Special Treatment:\nThe purpose of the quarter-point element is to embed the known asymptotic behavior of the near-tip field into the element's mapping. For a mode-I crack, displacements are proportional to $\\sqrt{r}$ and strains/stresses are proportional to $1/\\sqrt{r}$, where $r$ is the distance from the tip. The energy density, related to strain squared, is proportional to $1/r$. The current integrand $g(x,y)$ has a $1/\\sqrt{r}$ behavior, characteristic of certain terms in domain integral formulations.\n\nLet us analyze the mapping provided by the specified Q8 element along the line $\\eta=0$, which corresponds to the physical crack line $y=0$. The mapping reduces to:\n$$\nx(\\xi,0) = \\frac{L}{4}(1+\\xi)^2\n$$\nNear the crack tip $(\\xi \\to -1)$, let $\\zeta = 1+\\xi$. The physical radial coordinate $r$ scales as $r=x \\propto \\zeta^2$. This implies $\\sqrt{r} \\propto \\zeta = 1+\\xi$.\n\nNow, we examine the Jacobian determinant. A detailed analysis shows that near the crack tip at $(\\xi,\\eta)=(-1,0)$, the Jacobian matrix has the asymptotic form $J \\approx \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{L}{2}(1+\\xi) & 0 \\\\ 0 & H \\end{pmatrix}$, leading to a determinant:\n$$\n\\det(J) \\propto (1+\\xi) \\propto \\sqrt{r}\n$$\nThe term to be integrated in the reference space is the product $g(x,y)\\det(J)$. Near the tip, its behavior is:\n$$\ng \\cdot \\det(J) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{r}} \\cdot \\sqrt{r} = 1\n$$\nThe singularity in the original function $g(x,y)$ is canceled by the singularity embedded in the Jacobian determinant. The resulting integrand $g\\det(J)$ is regular (and nearly constant) in the reference space $(\\xi,\\eta)$, even at the point corresponding to the crack tip. Therefore, standard Gaussian quadrature can evaluate the integral with high accuracy. This regularization is the fundamental reason for using quarter-point elements in fracture mechanics.\n\nThe implementation will proceed by defining the shape functions and their derivatives for both Q4 and Q8 elements, constructing the Jacobian at each Gauss point, and accumulating the weighted sum.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import roots_legendre\n\ndef shape_functions_q4(xi, eta):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes shape functions and their derivatives for a 4-node quad element.\n    Nodes are ordered CCW from bottom-left (-1,-1).\n    \"\"\"\n    xi_nodes = np.array([-1, 1, 1, -1])\n    eta_nodes = np.array([-1, -1, 1, 1])\n\n    N = 0.25 * (1 + xi * xi_nodes) * (1 + eta * eta_nodes)\n    \n    dN_dxi = 0.25 * xi_nodes * (1 + eta * eta_nodes)\n    dN_deta = 0.25 * eta_nodes * (1 + xi * xi_nodes)\n\n    return N, dN_dxi, dN_deta\n\ndef shape_functions_q8(xi, eta):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes shape functions and their derivatives for an 8-node serendipity quad element.\n    Node numbering is as specified in the problem statement.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = np.zeros(8)\n    dN_dxi = np.zeros(8)\n    dN_deta = np.zeros(8)\n    \n    xi2 = xi * xi\n    eta2 = eta * eta\n\n    # Corner nodes (i=0 to 3, corresponding to nodes 1 to 4)\n    xi_n = np.array([-1, 1, 1, -1])\n    eta_n = np.array([-1, -1, 1, 1])\n\n    for i in range(4):\n        s = xi * xi_n[i]\n        t = eta * eta_n[i]\n        N[i] = 0.25 * (1 + s) * (1 + t) * (s + t - 1)\n        dN_dxi[i] = 0.25 * xi_n[i] * (1 + t) * (2 * s + t)\n        dN_deta[i] = 0.25 * eta_n[i] * (1 + s) * (s + 2 * t)\n\n    # Midside nodes (i=4 to 7, corresponding to nodes 5 to 8)\n    # Node 5: (xi=0, eta=-1)\n    N[4] = 0.5 * (1 - xi2) * (1 - eta)\n    dN_dxi[4] = -xi * (1 - eta)\n    dN_deta[4] = -0.5 * (1 - xi2)\n    \n    # Node 6: (xi=1, eta=0)\n    N[5] = 0.5 * (1 + xi) * (1 - eta2)\n    dN_dxi[5] = 0.5 * (1 - eta2)\n    dN_deta[5] = -eta * (1 + xi)\n\n    # Node 7: (xi=0, eta=1)\n    N[6] = 0.5 * (1 - xi2) * (1 + eta)\n    dN_dxi[6] = -xi * (1 + eta)\n    dN_deta[6] = 0.5 * (1 - xi2)\n    \n    # Node 8: (xi=-1, eta=0)\n    N[7] = 0.5 * (1 - xi) * (1 - eta2)\n    dN_dxi[7] = -0.5 * (1 - eta2)\n    dN_deta[7] = -eta * (1 - xi)\n    \n    return N, dN_dxi, dN_deta\n\ndef evaluate_integral(L, H, n, element_type):\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluates the domain integral using Gaussian quadrature.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get Gaussian quadrature points and weights\n    xi_p, w = roots_legendre(n)\n    \n    # Physical nodal coordinates\n    if element_type == 'Q4':\n        x_nodes = np.array([0, L, L, 0])\n        y_nodes = np.array([-H, -H, H, H])\n        shape_func = shape_functions_q4\n    elif element_type == 'Q8':\n        x_nodes = np.array([0, L, L, 0, L/4, L, L/4, 0])\n        y_nodes = np.array([-H, -H, H, H, -H, 0, H, 0])\n        shape_func = shape_functions_q8\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Unknown element type\")\n\n    integral_val = 0.0\n\n    # Tensor product quadrature loop\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            xi = xi_p[i]\n            eta = xi_p[j]\n            wi = w[i]\n            wj = w[j]\n\n            N, dN_dxi, dN_deta = shape_func(xi, eta)\n\n            # Isoparametric mapping\n            x = np.dot(N, x_nodes)\n            y = np.dot(N, y_nodes)\n\n            # Jacobian matrix\n            J11 = np.dot(dN_dxi, x_nodes)\n            J12 = np.dot(dN_dxi, y_nodes)\n            J21 = np.dot(dN_deta, x_nodes)\n            J22 = np.dot(dN_deta, y_nodes)\n\n            detJ = J11 * J22 - J12 * J21\n            \n            # Integrand g(x,y) = (x^2 + y^2)^(-1/4)\n            # Quadrature points are in (-1,1), so r will not be exactly 0\n            # for the mappings used.\n            r_squared = x*x + y*y\n            g = r_squared**(-0.25)\n            \n            integral_val += g * detJ * wi * wj\n            \n    return integral_val\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run the test suite and print results.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        # (L, H, n, element_type)\n        (1.0, 0.5, 8, 'Q4'),\n        (1.0, 0.5, 8, 'Q8'),\n        (0.1, 0.05, 16, 'Q8'),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        L, H, n, element_type = case\n        result = evaluate_integral(L, H, n, element_type)\n        results.append(result)\n        \n    # Format the output as specified\n    print(f\"[{','.join(f'{r:.10f}' for r in results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2602837"}]}
