This exercise introduces the foundational concept of using ionic radii to predict structural stability, a cornerstone of rational materials design for perovskites. By calculating the Goldschmidt tolerance factor ($t$) and the octahedral factor ($\\mu$), you will develop a quantitative feel for why certain compositions, like the mixed-cation variant presented here, are favored for forming the photoactive perovskite phase [@problem_id:2846468].", "problem": "A halide perovskite of nominal composition FA$_{0.83}$Cs$_{0.17}$PbI$_3$ is considered, where FA$^+$ denotes formamidinium. Treat the structure as an ideal cubic $ABX_3$ perovskite at the level of hard-sphere geometry and quasi-static ionic packing. Starting from the geometric constraints imposed by a corner-sharing $B$X$_6$ octahedral network in the ideal cubic perovskite (with $B$ cations octahedrally coordinated by anions and $A$ cations occupying the cuboctahedral site), derive the dimensionless ratios that govern geometric stability of the perovskite lattice:\n- the Goldschmidt tolerance factor $t$ as the ratio of the $A$–$X$ separation to the $B$–$X$ separation projected along the cubic directions, and\n- the octahedral factor $\\mu$ as the $B$-site to $X$-site hard-sphere radius ratio required for a $B$ cation to fit into an anion octahedron.\n\nAssume that the effective $A$-site radius of a mixed-cation composition is the composition-weighted linear average, i.e., $r_A = x\\,r_{\\mathrm{FA}^+} + (1-x)\\,r_{\\mathrm{Cs}^+}$ with $x = 0.83$.

Round your reported numerical values of $t$ and $\\mu$ to four significant figures, and express the final answer as a row matrix $\\bigl(t\\ \\ \\mu\\bigr)$ with dimensionless entries.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of two geometric stability parameters for the halide perovskite FA$_{0.83}$Cs$_{0.17}$PbI$_3$: the Goldschmidt tolerance factor $t$ and the octahedral factor $\\mu$. The analysis is based on a hard-sphere model of an ideal cubic $ABX_3$ perovskite structure.\n\nFirst, we establish the geometric relationships in an ideal cubic perovskite lattice with lattice parameter $a$. The $A$-site cation is at the cube corner (e.g., origin), the $B$-site cation is at the body center, and the $X$-site anions are at the face centers.\n- The $B$ cation at position $(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2})$ is octahedrally coordinated by six $X$ anions at positions like $(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, 0)$. The distance between the center of the $B$ cation and the center of an adjacent $X$ anion, $d_{BX}$, is half the lattice parameter:\n$$d_{BX} = \\frac{a}{2}$$\nIn a hard-sphere model where these ions are touching, this distance is the sum of their radii, $r_B$ and $r_X$:\n$$d_{BX} = r_B + r_X$$\nThis implies a relationship for the lattice parameter based on the dimensions of the $BX_6$ octahedral network:\n$$a = 2(r_B + r_X)$$\n- The $A$ cation at position $(0, 0, 0)$ is in a cuboctahedral void, coordinated by twelve $X$ anions. The distance from the $A$ cation to an adjacent $X$ anion at $(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, 0)$, denoted as $d_{AX}$, is the length of a face half-diagonal:\n$$d_{AX} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{2}} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nIn the ideal case where the $A$ and $X$ ions also touch, this distance is the sum of their radii, $r_A$ and $r_X$:\n$$d_{AX} = r_A + r_X$$\n\nNow we derive the dimensionless factors.\n\n1. The Goldschmidt Tolerance Factor ($t$):\nThe problem provides a definition for $t$ as \"the ratio of the $A$–$X$ separation to the $B$–$X$ separation projected along the cubic directions\". This phrasing is non-standard and ambiguous. We will proceed by deriving the standard definition from the geometric constraints, which is the only physically coherent interpretation. The tolerance factor quantifies the size mismatch between the $A$-cation and the void provided for it by the corner-sharing $BX_6$ framework. The size of this void is determined by the $A-X$ distance as dictated by the framework's geometry, which is $d_{AX} = a/\\sqrt{2}$. Substituting the expression for $a$ from the $B-X$ bond, we find the available distance:\n$$d_{AX, \\text{framework}} = \\frac{2(r_B + r_X)}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}(r_B + r_X)$$\nThe bond length required to accommodate the $A$ and $X$ ions, based on their radii, is:\n$$d_{AX, \\text{radii}} = r_A + r_X$$\nThe tolerance factor $t$ is the ratio of the length required by the ions to the length provided by the framework. For a perfect geometric fit, these two lengths must be equal, so $t=1$.\n$$t = \\frac{d_{AX, \\text{radii}}}{d_{AX, \\text{framework}}} = \\frac{r_A + r_X}{\\sqrt{2}(r_B + r_X)}$$\nThis is the standard and correct formula for the Goldschmidt tolerance factor.\n\n2. The Octahedral Factor ($\\mu$):\nThe problem defines $\\mu$ as \"the $B$-site to $X$-site hard-sphere radius ratio\". This factor assesses the stability of the $BX_6$ octahedron itself. It is simply the ratio of the radius of the cation at the B-site to that of the anion at the X-site.\n$$\\mu = \\frac{r_B}{r_X}$$\nFor the $B$ cation to be large enough to prevent the octahedron from being unstable (i.e., to prevent the anions from touching each other), its radius must satisfy the geometric condition $r_B \\ge (\\sqrt{2}-1)r_X$, which implies $\\mu \\ge \\sqrt{2}-1 \\approx 0.414$. The factor $\\mu$ itself is the direct ratio of the radii.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical values for FA$_{0.83}$Cs$_{0.17}$PbI$_3$. The ionic radii are given as $r_B = r_{\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}} = 1.19\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}$ and $r_X = r_{\\mathrm{I}^{-}} = 2.20\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}$.\nThe effective radius of the mixed $A$-site cation, $r_A$, is calculated as the composition-weighted average:\n$r_A = x\\,r_{\\mathrm{FA}^+} + (1-x)\\,r_{\\mathrm{Cs}^+}$, with $x=0.83$.\n$$r_A = (0.83)(2.53\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}) + (0.17)(1.88\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}) = 2.0999\\ \\mathrm{\\AA} + 0.3196\\ \\mathrm{\\AA} = 2.4195\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}$$\n\nNow we can calculate $\\mu$ and $t$:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{r_B}{r_X} = \\frac{1.19}{2.20} \\approx 0.540909...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\mu = 0.5409$.\n\n$$t = \\frac{r_A + r_X}{\\sqrt{2}(r_B + r_X)} = \\frac{2.4195 + 2.20}{\\sqrt{2}(1.19 + 2.20)} = \\frac{4.6195}{\\sqrt{2}(3.39)} \\approx \\frac{4.6195}{4.79418} \\approx 0.96356...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $t = 0.9636$.\n\nFinally, a qualitative assessment of phase stability is required.\nThe calculated octahedral factor is $\\mu \\approx 0.5409$. This value is substantially greater than the minimal threshold for octahedral stability ($\\mu  \\sqrt{2}-1 \\approx 0.414$), indicating that the Pb$^{2+}$ cation is sufficiently large to form a stable octahedral coordination with the I$^{-}$ anions.\nThe calculated tolerance factor is $t \\approx 0.9636$. For halide perovskites, the ideal cubic or pseudocubic perovskite phase is empirically found to be most stable for $t$ in the range of approximately $0.9  t  1.0$. Values of $t  1$ tend to favor the formation of non-perovskite hexagonal phases, while values of $t  0.9$ typically lead to significant octahedral tilting and lower-symmetry structures that may exhibit poor optoelectronic properties or be thermodynamically unstable. The computed value of $t = 0.9636$ falls squarely within the optimal window for stable, high-quality perovskite phase formation.\n\nTherefore, based on this geometric analysis, both $t$ and $\\mu$ values are favorable. The combination of a sufficiently large $B$-cation and an $A$-cation of nearly ideal size suggests that the cubic (or near-cubic) perovskite phase of FA$_{0.83}$Cs$_{0.17}$PbI$_3$ is geometrically stable and should be favored over non-perovskite polymorphs.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.9636  0.5409 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2846468"}, {"introduction": "For any solar cell material, the optical bandgap ($E_g$) is arguably the most critical parameter, as it determines which part of the solar spectrum can be absorbed and converted into electricity.

The solution is executed in two stages: first, the theoretical basis for the data analysis is established from fundamental principles; second, the data are processed according to this theoretical model to extract the value of $E_g$.\n\nThe relationship between the absorption coefficient $\\alpha$ and the photon energy $E = \\hbar\\omega$ for a direct bandgap semiconductor is derived from Fermi's Golden Rule. The transition rate $W_{i \\to f}$ from an initial valence band state $|v, \\vec{k}\\rangle$ to a final conduction band state $|c, \\vec{k}'\\rangle$ is given by:\n$$W_{v, \\vec{k} \\to c, \\vec{k}'} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar} |\\langle c, \\vec{k}' | H' | v, \\vec{k} \\rangle|^2 \\delta(E_c(\\vec{k}') - E_v(\\vec{k}) - E)$$\nwhere $H'$ is the light-matter interaction Hamiltonian. For a direct transition, momentum is conserved, so $\\vec{k}' \\approx \\vec{k}$.\n\nAssuming parabolic bands for a three-dimensional crystal system, the energies of the conduction band ($E_c$) and valence band ($E_v$) relative to the top of the valence band are:\n$$E_c(\\vec{k}) = E_g + \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m_e^*}$$\n$$E_v(\\vec{k}) = -\\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m_h^*}$$\nwhere $m_e^*$ and $m_h^*$ are the effective masses of the electron and hole, respectively, and $k = |\\vec{k}|$. The energy conservation condition for a photon of energy $E$ becomes:\n$$E = E_c(\\vec{k}) - E_v(\\vec{k}) = E_g + \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2\\mu^*}$$\nwhere $\\mu^* = (1/m_e^* + 1/m_h^*)^{-1}$ is the reduced effective mass.\n\nThe absorption coefficient $\\alpha(E)$ is proportional to the total transition rate, which involves summing over all possible initial and final states. This summation is replaced by an integral over k-space. The resulting expression for $\\alpha(E)$ is:\n$$\\alpha(E) \\propto \\frac{1}{E} \\int_0^\\infty |M|^2 g_{joint}(E) dE$$\nwhere $|M|^2=|\\langle c, \\vec{k} | H' | v, \\vec{k} \\rangle|^2$ is the transition matrix element, assumed to be approximately constant for allowed transitions near the band edge. The joint density of states, $g_{joint}(E)$, represents the number of available transition pairs per unit volume per unit energy. For a 3D system, it can be shown to be:\n$$g_{joint}(E) \\propto (2\\mu^*)^{3/2} \\sqrt{E-E_g}$$\nfor $E  E_g$, and zero otherwise. Combining these results gives the characteristic energy dependence for a direct allowed transition:\n$$\\alpha(E) = \\frac{C_{\\text{mat}}}{E}\\sqrt{E-E_g}$$\nwhere $C_{\\text{mat}}$ is a material-dependent constant. To linearize this relationship, the equation is rearranged and squared:\n$$(\\alpha(E) E)^2 = C_{\\text{mat}}^2 (E - E_g)$$\nThis equation is of the form $Y = mX + b$, where $Y = (\\alpha E)^2$, $X = E$, the slope is $m = C_{\\text{mat}}^2$, and the intercept is $b = -C_{\\text{mat}}^2 E_g$. A plot of $(\\alpha E)^2$ versus $E$, known as a Tauc plot, will therefore be a straight line for energies above the bandgap. The extrapolation of this line to the energy axis (where $(\\alpha E)^2 = 0$) directly yields the bandgap energy, $E_g = -b/m$.\n\nNext, the absorption coefficient $\\alpha$ must be calculated from the experimental data. The problem specifies that measured transmission $T$ and reflectance $R$ are provided for a film of thickness $d$. Critically, the model must neglect coherent interference and multiple internal reflections. This instruction is interpreted as a single-pass model where a beam enters the front surface, is attenuated through the bulk, and exits the back surface. The fractional intensity transmitted, $T$, is thus:\n$$T = \\frac{I_0 (1-R) \\exp(-\\alpha d) (1-R)}{I_0} = (1-R)^2 \\exp(-\\alpha d)$$\nwhere $(1-R)$ accounts for reflection loss at the front interface and the second $(1-R)$ accounts for reflection loss at the back interface, assuming symmetric interfaces. Solving for $\\alpha$ yields:\n$$\\alpha(E) = \\frac{1}{d} \\ln\\left( \\frac{(1-R)^2}{T(E)} \\right)$$\nWith the provided data: $d = 500\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ and $R = 0.06$.
