It presents a standard, well-posed problem in condensed matter physics: the self-consistent calculation of the electronic structure of a two-dimensional electron gas in a wide quantum well under a perpendicular magnetic field. The physical model is based on the Schrödinger-Poisson equations within the Hartree approximation, a cornerstone of many-body physics. The parameters, boundary conditions, and algorithmic steps are specified with sufficient clarity and are scientifically sound. The problem is a non-trivial computational task that correctly models the competition between quantum confinement, electron-electron interactions, and Landau quantization in the Integer Quantum Hall Effect regime.\n\nThe solution is obtained by implementing the prescribed iterative self-consistent field (SCF) procedure. The core of the method is to find a stationary solution for the Hartree potential $V_{\\mathrm{H}}(z)$ and the corresponding electron wavefunctions $\\psi_n(z)$ and subband energies $\\varepsilon_n$.\n\nThe domain, a one-dimensional quantum well of width $W$, is discretized along the $z$-axis into a uniform grid with $N_z$ points and a spacing of $\\Delta z$. I use $z=0$ as the center of the well, so the domain is $[-W/2, W/2]$. Dirichlet boundary conditions, $\\psi_n(\\pm W/2)=0$ and $V_{\\mathrm{H}}(\\pm W/2)=0$, are imposed at the well edges.\n\nThe one-dimensional Schrödinger equation for the envelope functions $\\psi_n(z)$ is\n$$\n\\left[-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m^\\ast}\\frac{d^2}{dz^2} + V_{\\mathrm{H}}(z)\\right]\\psi_n(z) = \\varepsilon_n \\psi_n(z)\n$$\nThis equation is solved as a matrix eigenvalue problem on the discretized grid. The second derivative operator is approximated using a central finite difference scheme, resulting in a tridiagonal Hamiltonian matrix for the internal grid points. The eigensolutions $(\\varepsilon_n, \\psi_n)$ are found using a numerical eigensolver. The computed eigenvectors are normalized such that $\\int_{-W/2}^{W/2} |\\psi_n(z)|^2 dz = 1$. A sufficiently large number of subbands, $N_{sub}$, must be computed to form a complete enough basis for the occupied states.\n\nOnce the subband energies $\\varepsilon_n$ are known for a given iterate of $V_{\\mathrm{H}}(z)$, the energies of the Landau levels are given by $E_{n,\\ell} = \\varepsilon_n + (\\ell + 1/2)\\hbar\\omega_c$, where $\\omega_c = eB/m^\\ast$ is the cyclotron frequency. At zero temperature, electrons fill these discrete energy levels starting from the lowest one. The degeneracy of each Landau level per unit area is $g_B = eB/h$. Given a total electron sheet density $N_s$, the integer filling factor is $\\nu = N_s/g_B$. We populate the lowest $\\nu$ energy levels from the combined list of all states $\\{E_{n,\\ell}\\}$. The sheet density $n_n$ for each subband is then calculated by summing the degeneracies of all occupied Landau levels belonging to that subband: $n_n = g_B \\times (\\text{number of occupied levels in subband } n)$.\n\nWith the subband densities $n_n$ and the wavefunctions $\\psi_n(z)$, the three-dimensional electron density is constructed as $n_e(z) = \\sum_n n_n |\\psi_n(z)|^2$. This density serves as input for the Poisson equation, which determines the new Hartree potential:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 V_{\\mathrm{H}}}{dz^2} = \\frac{e^2}{\\varepsilon}\\left[n_{\\mathrm{bg}}(z) - n_e(z)\\right]\n$$\nHere, $n_{\\mathrm{bg}}(z) = N_s/W$ is the uniform positive background charge density required for overall neutrality. This is a one-dimensional boundary value problem, which is solved on the grid by converting it into a system of linear equations for the potential values at the internal grid points, $V_{\\mathrm{H}}(z_i)$.\n\nThe self-consistent loop proceeds as follows:\n1. Initialize the Hartree potential, typically $V_{\\mathrm{H}}^{(0)}(z) = 0$.\n2. In iteration $k$:\n   a. Solve the Schrödinger equation using $V_{\\mathrm{H}}^{(k-1)}(z)$ to find $\\varepsilon_n$ and $\\psi_n(z)$.\n   b. Determine the subband occupations $n_n$ by filling the Landau levels.\n   c. Calculate the new electron density $n_e(z)$.\n   d. Solve the Poisson equation to find the resulting potential, $V_{\\mathrm{H, new}}(z)$.\n   e. Update the Hartree potential using linear mixing to ensure stable convergence: $V_{\\mathrm{H}}^{(k)}(z) = (1-\\alpha)V_{\\mathrm{H}}^{(k-1)}(z) + \\alpha V_{\\mathrm{H, new}}(z)$, where $\\alpha$ is a small mixing parameter.\n3. The loop is terminated when the change in the potential between iterations falls below a specified tolerance, e.g., $\\max_z|V_{\\mathrm{H}}^{(k)}(z) - V_{\\mathrm{H}}^{(k-1)}(z)| < \\delta$.\n\nUpon convergence, the final set of occupations $\\{n_n\\}$ is used to identify the subbands that contribute to the total density ($n_n>0$). The number of such subbands $K$ and their $1$-based indices are reported along with the filling factor $\\nu$. The provided code implements this full numerical procedure for the three specified test cases. For the numerical implementation, I use a grid of $N_z=401$ points, compute $N_{sub}=20$ subbands, a mixing parameter $\\alpha=0.1$, and a convergence tolerance of $10^{-6} \\text{ eV}$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.linalg import eigh_tridiagonal, solve_banded\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the self-consistent Hartree problem for a 2DEG in a wide quantum well\n    under a magnetic field for the given test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Physical Constants (CODATA 2018)\n    e = 1.602176634e-19      # Elementary charge in C\n    m_e = 9.1093837015e-31   # Electron mass in kg\n    h = 6.62607015e-34      # Planck constant in J*s\n    hbar = h / (2 * np.pi)   # Reduced Planck constant in J*s\n    eps0 = 8.8541878128e-12 # Vacuum permittivity in F/m\n\n    # Material Parameters for GaAs\n    m_star = 0.067 * m_e  # Effective mass\n    eps_r = 12.9          # Relative permittivity\n    epsilon = eps_r * eps0 # Permittivity\n\n    # Numerical parameters for the simulation\n    Nz = 401             # Number of grid points (must be odd for centering)\n    Nsub = 20            # Number of subbands to compute\n    Lmax = 20            # Maximum Landau level index to consider\n    alpha = 0.1          # Mixing parameter for SCF\n    tolerance = 1e-6 * e # Convergence tolerance in Joules (1 micro-eV)\n    max_iter = 200       # Maximum SCF iterations\n\n    def run_scf(W, B, Ns):\n        \"\"\"\n        Performs the self-consistent field calculation for a single case.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Discretization of the well from -W/2 to W/2\n        z_grid = np.linspace(-W / 2, W / 2, Nz)\n        dz = z_grid[1] - z_grid[0]\n\n        # Schrödinger equation: Kinetic part setup (tridiagonal matrix)\n        # H = (-hbar^2/2m*) d^2/dz^2 + V(z)\n        diag_kin = np.full(Nz - 2, 2.0)\n        offdiag_kin = np.full(Nz - 3, -1.0)\n        K_factor = -hbar**2 / (2 * m_star * dz**2)\n        \n        # Poisson equation: Laplacian setup (tridiagonal matrix)\n        # solve_banded expects the matrix in a specific banded format.\n        # For a tridiagonal matrix, it's 3 rows: (super-diag, main-diag, sub-diag)\n        A_poisson = np.zeros((3, Nz - 2))\n        A_poisson[0, 1:] = 1.0   # Superdiagonal\n        A_poisson[1, :] = -2.0  # Main diagonal\n        A_poisson[2, :-1] = 1.0  # Subdiagonal\n        \n        # Pre-calculate constants for the current case\n        g_B = e * B / h\n        nu = int(round(Ns / g_B))\n        hbar_wc = e * B / m_star * hbar\n        n_bg_val = Ns / W\n        \n        # SCF iteration loop\n        V_H = np.zeros_like(z_grid)\n        \n        final_occupied_levels = []\n\n        for i in range(max_iter):\n            V_H_old = V_H.copy()\n            \n            # 1.
