## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Having established the fundamental principles and electronic properties of Weyl and Dirac [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) in the preceding chapters, we now turn our attention to the rich and diverse landscape of their applications. The unique topological nature of these materials is not merely a theoretical curiosity; it gives rise to a host of extraordinary physical phenomena with profound implications for fundamental science and next-generation technologies. This chapter will explore how the core concepts—linear dispersion, chiral fermions, Berry curvature, and the [bulk-boundary correspondence](@entry_id:137647)—manifest in measurable responses and can be harnessed in various interdisciplinary contexts. We will examine their distinctive electromagnetic and [thermal transport](@entry_id:198424) signatures, survey the key experimental techniques used to probe their topological character, and investigate how their properties can be engineered by external stimuli such as mechanical strain and light. Finally, we will touch upon the deep connections these materials forge with high-energy physics and [topological quantum computation](@entry_id:142804), illustrating their role as a fertile ground for discovering new physics.

### Electromagnetic, Optical, and Thermal Responses

The nontrivial topology of the electronic bands in Weyl semimetals leaves an indelible mark on their response to external fields. These signatures are often the first experimental indicators of a material's Weyl character.

#### Anomalous Hall and Nernst Effects

Perhaps the most direct transport consequence of the Berry curvature is the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE). In a time-reversal-symmetry-broken Weyl semimetal, the Weyl nodes act as [sources and sinks](@entry_id:263105) (monopoles and antimonopoles) of Berry curvature in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936). The integral of this Berry curvature over the occupied states in the Brillouin zone yields a finite anomalous Hall conductivity, even in the absence of magnetism. A key result is that the magnitude of this conductivity is directly proportional to the momentum-space separation of the Weyl nodes of opposite [chirality](@entry_id:144105). For a [minimal model](@entry_id:268530) with two nodes separated by a vector $2\mathbf{b}$, the anomalous Hall conductivity vector is given by $\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{AHC} = \frac{e^2}{\pi h} \mathbf{b}$, where the direction of the conductivity is parallel to the node separation. This remarkable relationship provides a direct link between a macroscopic transport measurement and the topological structure of the band theory, allowing for an experimental probe of the Weyl node configuration [@problem_id:2870313].

This topological influence extends beyond purely electrical transport into the realm of [thermoelectricity](@entry_id:142802). The same Berry curvature that deflects charge carriers to produce an anomalous Hall voltage also deflects heat carriers. This gives rise to a transverse thermal gradient in response to a longitudinal electrical current, or conversely, a transverse electrical current in response to a longitudinal thermal gradient—the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE). The anomalous Nernst coefficient, $\alpha_{xy}$, is intimately related to the anomalous Hall conductivity, $\sigma_{xy}$, through the Mott relation. At low temperatures and near the charge neutrality point, a Sommerfeld expansion reveals that the Nernst coefficient is proportional to the [energy derivative](@entry_id:268961) of the Hall conductivity at the Fermi level and linear in temperature: $\alpha_{xy}(T) \approx -\frac{\pi^2 k_B^2 T}{3e} \frac{d\sigma_{xy}}{d\mu}|_{\mu=0}$. Consequently, a large and sharp variation of the anomalous Hall conductivity with energy near the Weyl points, a common feature due to the rapidly changing Berry curvature, leads to a giant anomalous Nernst response. This provides not only another signature of the Weyl physics but also suggests potential applications in [solid-state cooling](@entry_id:153888) and thermal [energy harvesting](@entry_id:144965) [@problem_id:2870309].

#### Linear and Nonlinear Optical Responses

The optical properties of Weyl and Dirac semimetals are also distinctive. The three-dimensional [linear dispersion relation](@entry_id:266313), $E(\mathbf{k}) = \pm \hbar v_F |\mathbf{k}|$, leads to a frequency-dependent [optical conductivity](@entry_id:139437) that serves as a key spectroscopic fingerprint. In an ideal, clean Weyl semimetal at zero temperature with the chemical potential at the nodes, interband [optical absorption](@entry_id:136597) is the dominant process. A theoretical derivation using the Kubo formalism shows that the real part of the [optical conductivity](@entry_id:139437), $\sigma_1(\omega)$, scales linearly with the photon frequency $\omega$. For a system with $N$ Weyl nodes, this conductivity is given by $\sigma_1(\omega) = \frac{N e^2 \omega}{24 \pi \hbar v_F}$. This linear dependence is a direct consequence of the [joint density of states](@entry_id:143002), which scales as $\omega^2$, and the velocity [matrix elements](@entry_id:186505) characteristic of the 3D conical bands. This contrasts sharply with the frequency-independent conductivity of 2D graphene and provides a clear experimental target for optical characterization of candidate materials [@problem_id:2870341].

Beyond the linear response regime, the unique symmetries of certain Weyl semimetals give rise to exotic nonlinear optical and electronic phenomena. In Weyl semimetals that break [inversion symmetry](@entry_id:269948) but preserve time-reversal symmetry, a DC electric field can generate a transverse Hall-like current that is quadratic in the field strength, $j^{(2)}_{a} \propto E_b E_c$. This nonlinear Hall effect is a second-order response that is forbidden in systems with [inversion symmetry](@entry_id:269948). Its physical origin lies in the existence of a "Berry curvature dipole" in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936), which quantifies the net moment of the Berry curvature distribution over the occupied states. In gyrotropic crystal classes, this dipole gives rise to a nonlinear [conductivity tensor](@entry_id:155827) $\chi_{abc}$ whose form is determined by the dipole vector $\mathbf{D}$. This effect not only serves as a sensitive probe of [inversion symmetry breaking](@entry_id:141266) but also opens avenues for [frequency doubling](@entry_id:180511) and [rectification](@entry_id:197363) in topological devices without requiring an external magnetic field [@problem_id:2870290].

### The Chiral Anomaly and Magnetotransport

One of the most celebrated phenomena in Weyl semimetals is the manifestation of the [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077), a fundamental quantum [field theory](@entry_id:155241) effect, in a solid-state transport experiment. This anomaly refers to the non-conservation of the number of particles of a given [chirality](@entry_id:144105) in the presence of parallel electric ($\mathbf{E}$) and magnetic ($\mathbf{B}$) fields.

The microscopic origin of this phenomenon is rooted in the unique Landau level structure of Weyl fermions. When a magnetic field is applied, the continuous [energy bands](@entry_id:146576) coalesce into quantized Landau levels. For a Weyl cone, this quantization results in a highly unusual spectrum containing a special zeroth Landau level that is "chiral"—its dispersion is linear in the momentum component parallel to the magnetic field, $E_0(k_z) = \chi \hbar v_F k_z$, where $\chi$ is the chirality of the Weyl node. This means that for a given chirality, the electrons in this level can only travel in one direction along the magnetic field. When an electric field is also applied parallel to $\mathbf{B}$, it accelerates electrons along this one-way channel, effectively "pumping" them from one Weyl node to the other and thereby violating the conservation of chiral charge [@problem_id:2870321].

This microscopic pumping of charge gives rise to a remarkable macroscopic transport signature: a large positive longitudinal magnetoconductivity, or equivalently, a [negative longitudinal magnetoresistance](@entry_id:146729). A semiclassical picture captures this effect beautifully. The $\mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{B}$ term acts as a source, creating an imbalance in the chemical potentials of the two opposite-[chirality](@entry_id:144105) nodes. This imbalance, in turn, drives a current parallel to the magnetic field via the [chiral magnetic effect](@entry_id:143193). In steady state, this anomalous current adds to the conventional Drude current, resulting in an enhanced conductivity. The magnitude of this additional conductivity is proportional to the square of the magnetic field, $\Delta\sigma_{zz} \propto B^2$, and is modulated by the angle $\theta$ between the fields as $\cos^2(\theta)$ [@problem_id:1122852] [@problem_id:2870329]. This sharp decrease in resistance when the electric and magnetic fields are aligned is one of the most sought-after experimental proofs of the existence of Weyl fermions in a material.

### Experimental Probes of Topological Features

Verifying the topological nature of a material requires experimental techniques capable of directly or indirectly probing the defining characteristics: the bulk nodes, the surface Fermi arcs, and the nontrivial Berry phase.

A powerful method for probing the topological character of the bulk Fermi surface is through the analysis of [quantum oscillations](@entry_id:142355), such as the de Haas-van Alphen effect (oscillations in magnetization) or the Shubnikov-de Haas effect (oscillations in resistivity). According to the semiclassical Lifshitz-Onsager quantization rule, the phase of these oscillations depends on the Berry phase accumulated by an electron traversing a cyclotron orbit in momentum space. For a conventional parabolic band, this phase is zero. For a Dirac or Weyl fermion, the Berry phase is $\pi$. This topological phase can be extracted directly from a "Landau fan diagram," a plot of the oscillation index $n$ versus the inverse magnetic field $1/B$. The intercept of this plot reveals the phase, and an intercept of $\pm 1/8$ (depending on the dimensionality and orbit type) after accounting for the standard Maslov correction is considered definitive evidence for the nontrivial $\pi$ Berry phase associated with a Weyl or Dirac cone [@problem_id:2870310].

The most iconic feature of a Weyl semimetal is the existence of Fermi arcs on its surface. These are open-ended contours in the surface Brillouin zone that connect the projections of bulk Weyl nodes of opposite chirality. Angle-resolved [photoemission spectroscopy](@entry_id:139547) (ARPES) is the primary experimental tool for their direct visualization. A conclusive identification of Fermi arcs requires a careful protocol. First, one must establish the surface nature of the observed state by showing that its energy dispersion is independent of the momentum component perpendicular to the surface, which is achieved by varying the incident [photon energy](@entry_id:139314). Second, the defining [topological property](@entry_id:141605) must be verified: the state must form an open arc whose endpoints terminate at the projections of the bulk Weyl nodes. These node projections can be identified independently through bulk-sensitive ARPES measurements or by observing that the endpoints of the non-dispersing surface arc are pinned to features that do disperse with [photon energy](@entry_id:139314), confirming their bulk origin [@problem_id:3024267].

Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) provides a complementary, real-space probe of the [surface electronic structure](@entry_id:201446). By measuring the spatial modulation of the [local density of states](@entry_id:136852) around impurities, and Fourier transforming this data, one obtains a [quasiparticle interference](@entry_id:146303) (QPI) pattern. This pattern reflects the allowed scattering vectors that connect states on the constant-energy contours. For a Fermi arc, the QPI pattern has a unique fingerprint: a profound suppression of backscattering signals. This suppression arises for two compounding reasons: first, for a single open arc, the state at $-\mathbf{k}$ is generally not available for scattering; second, the chiral [spin-momentum locking](@entry_id:139865) of the Weyl surface states makes the [spinor](@entry_id:154461) wavefunctions for forward- and backward-propagating states nearly orthogonal, suppressing scattering by nonmagnetic impurities. This systematic absence of [backscattering](@entry_id:142561) in the QPI pattern is a powerful signature of the open, chiral nature of the Fermi arc [@problem_id:3024299].

### Engineering and Controlling Topological States

A particularly exciting frontier is the ability to manipulate and even create [topological phases](@entry_id:141674) on demand using external tuning parameters. This opens the door to "[topological electronics](@entry_id:141348)" where the electronic properties are controlled by external fields.

Mechanical strain has emerged as a powerful tool for tuning the electronic structure of Weyl [semimetals](@entry_id:152277). Because the locations of Weyl nodes are determined by the delicate balance of hopping parameters in a crystal lattice, any deformation that modifies these parameters can shift the nodes in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936). A theoretical analysis based on a [tight-binding model](@entry_id:143446) shows that a homogeneous strain $\epsilon_{ij}$ induces a shift in a Weyl node's position that is linearly proportional to the strain components. This effect provides a direct "straintronic" control knob for the topological properties, such as the momentum-space separation of the nodes, which in turn controls the anomalous Hall conductivity [@problem_id:2870344]. More dramatically, strain can be used to induce a [topological phase transition](@entry_id:137214). For instance, applying a uniform [torsional strain](@entry_id:195818) to a cylindrical nanowire of a Dirac semimetal can break the rotational symmetry that protects the Dirac point, causing it to split into a pair of Weyl points. The separation of these induced Weyl points is directly proportional to the applied twist, demonstrating the creation of a Weyl semimetal from a parent Dirac semimetal via mechanical means [@problem_id:1239169].

Even more radical control can be achieved using light. The field of Floquet engineering explores how periodically driving a system, for instance by irradiating it with intense laser light, can create effective Hamiltonians with properties vastly different from the static material. A remarkable prediction is that a conventional, topologically trivial band insulator can be transformed into a Weyl semimetal by shining circularly polarized light on it. The light field dynamically modifies the [band structure](@entry_id:139379), effectively creating a "Floquet-Weyl" state. The intensity of the light acts as a tuning parameter that can control the energy gap, and above a critical intensity, the gap can be closed and reopened, leaving behind a pair of Weyl points whose separation in momentum space is determined by the light intensity. This offers an ultrafast, [all-optical switch](@entry_id:166899) for [topological phases](@entry_id:141674) [@problem_id:1827831].

### Interdisciplinary Frontiers

The physics of Weyl and Dirac [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) extends beyond traditional condensed matter, forging deep connections with [high-energy physics](@entry_id:181260), materials science, and quantum information.

Many of the phenomena observed in these materials are [condensed matter](@entry_id:747660) realizations of concepts originally developed in the context of relativistic quantum [field theory](@entry_id:155241). The [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077) is a prime example. Another profound connection is found in the [axion electrodynamics](@entry_id:144423) description of [topological insulators](@entry_id:137834) and [semimetals](@entry_id:152277). The effective electromagnetic Lagrangian in these materials contains a topological "theta term," $\mathcal{L}_{\theta} \propto \theta \, \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{B}$. This term leads to a modified set of Maxwell's equations where magnetic fields can source electric charge density and vice versa. One of its most striking consequences is a condensed matter analog of the Witten effect: a [magnetic monopole](@entry_id:149129) placed inside such a material will induce a co-located electric charge proportional to the [axion angle](@entry_id:139420) $\theta$ and the monopole strength $g$. While true [magnetic monopoles](@entry_id:142817) remain hypothetical, this effect can be probed using local [magnetic field sources](@entry_id:267241), providing a testbed for fundamental concepts in particle physics and cosmology [@problem_id:1239167].

The unique [surface states](@entry_id:137922) of Weyl semimetals also provide a promising platform for realizing other exotic [topological phases of matter](@entry_id:144114). A particularly compelling direction is the creation of Majorana fermions, particles that are their own antiparticles, which are sought-after building blocks for fault-tolerant topological quantum computers. One proposed method involves creating a [heterostructure](@entry_id:144260) by placing a Weyl semimetal in proximity to a conventional superconductor. The superconductivity induced on the topologically protected Fermi arc [surface states](@entry_id:137922) can, under the right conditions (such as proximity to a $p$-wave superconductor), give rise to a one-dimensional channel hosting Majorana zero modes. In such a system, the resulting hybrid state can exhibit a flat-band dispersion of Majorana modes, a unique feature that could be probed in tunneling experiments. This research direction highlights how Weyl semimetals can serve as a foundational material for building more complex quantum devices [@problem_id:1122817].

In summary, the applications and interdisciplinary connections of Weyl and Dirac semimetals are as vast as they are profound. From providing new paradigms for electronic and spintronic devices to serving as a laboratory for fundamental physics, these [topological materials](@entry_id:142123) continue to challenge our understanding and inspire new avenues of scientific and technological exploration.
