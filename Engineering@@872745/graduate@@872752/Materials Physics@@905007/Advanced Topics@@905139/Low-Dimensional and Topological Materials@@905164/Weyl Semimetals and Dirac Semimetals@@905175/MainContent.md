## Introduction
In the landscape of modern [condensed matter](@entry_id:747660) physics, [topological materials](@entry_id:142123) have emerged as a revolutionary frontier, hosting exotic [electronic states](@entry_id:171776) protected by fundamental symmetries. Among the most fascinating of these are Weyl and Dirac semimetals, three-dimensional materials whose low-energy excitations behave not as conventional electrons, but as relativistic Weyl or Dirac fermions—particles once thought to exist only in the realm of [high-energy physics](@entry_id:181260). This unique property endows them with a host of extraordinary physical phenomena, yet understanding the deep connection between their abstract topological character and their measurable properties presents a significant challenge. This article provides a graduate-level guide to bridge this gap, systematically building a robust understanding of these remarkable quantum materials.

We will begin in **Principles and Mechanisms** by dissecting the core theoretical framework, from the definition of a Weyl node as a momentum-space monopole to the crucial roles of symmetry and the celebrated bulk-boundary correspondence. Next, in **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, we will explore how these principles manifest as tangible physical signatures, examining their unique transport and optical responses, the experimental tools used for their detection, and their profound links to quantum field theory. Finally, **Hands-On Practices** will provide opportunities to apply these concepts through targeted computational and theoretical problems, solidifying the connection between theory and practice.

## Principles and Mechanisms

In this chapter, we transition from a general introduction to a rigorous examination of the principles and mechanisms that define Weyl and Dirac semimetals. We will dissect the mathematical and physical underpinnings of these [topological phases](@entry_id:141674), beginning with the [fundamental unit](@entry_id:180485)—the Weyl node—and progressively building up to the role of symmetries, the constraints imposed by crystal lattices, and the exotic surface phenomena that serve as their definitive signatures.

### The Weyl Node: A Monopole in Momentum Space

At the heart of a Weyl semimetal lies the **Weyl node**, an [isolated point](@entry_id:146695) in the three-dimensional Brillouin zone where two [electronic bands](@entry_id:175335) cross with a linear dispersion. To understand its properties, we can begin with a generic two-band Bloch Hamiltonian, which, near a degeneracy point, can be expressed in the basis of two states as:
$H(\mathbf{k}) = \sum_{i=x,y,z} d_i(\mathbf{k})\sigma_i + d_0(\mathbf{k})\mathbb{I}$
Here, $\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices representing a [pseudospin](@entry_id:147053) degree of freedom (which could be actual spin or an orbital/sublattice degree of freedom), $\mathbb{I}$ is the $2 \times 2$ identity matrix, and $\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k}) = (d_x, d_y, d_z)$ and $d_0(\mathbf{k})$ are real functions of the crystal momentum $\mathbf{k}$.

The [energy eigenvalues](@entry_id:144381) of this Hamiltonian are $E_{\pm}(\mathbf{k}) = d_0(\mathbf{k}) \pm |\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k})|$. A [band crossing](@entry_id:161733), or degeneracy, occurs when the gap between the bands closes, which requires $|\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k})| = 0$. This condition is met only if all three components of the vector $\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k})$ vanish simultaneously. Let us assume such a point exists at $\mathbf{k} = \mathbf{k}_0$.

For this degeneracy to be an [isolated point](@entry_id:146695) node, the linear approximation of the map from [momentum space](@entry_id:148936) to the space of the $\mathbf{d}$ vector near $\mathbf{k}_0$ must be invertible. That is, for $\delta\mathbf{k} = \mathbf{k} - \mathbf{k}_0$, the expansion $d_i(\mathbf{k}) \approx \sum_{j=x,y,z} M_{ij} \delta k_j$ must have a non-singular Jacobian matrix $M_{ij} = \frac{\partial d_i}{\partial k_j}|_{\mathbf{k}_0}$. If the determinant of this $3 \times 3$ matrix, $\det(M)$, is non-zero, the equation $\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k}) = \mathbf{0}$ has only one solution at $\mathbf{k} = \mathbf{k}_0$, confirming the existence of an isolated linear crossing—a Weyl node [@problem_id:3024257].

This seemingly simple mathematical condition conceals a profound topological property. The Weyl node is not merely a [band crossing](@entry_id:161733); it is a topologically protected object that carries an integer charge known as **chirality**. The chirality, denoted by $\chi$, is a [topological invariant](@entry_id:142028) that quantifies the "handedness" of the quasiparticles near the node. It is defined by the orientation of the mapping from the momentum coordinates around the node to the components of the $\mathbf{d}$ vector. Mathematically, it is given by the sign of the determinant of the Jacobian matrix:
$\chi = \mathrm{sgn}(\det(M))$

This integer charge, $\chi = \pm 1$, is robust against any small perturbations that do not close the bulk band gap elsewhere and annihilate the node with another of opposite chirality. For instance, adding a smooth, [pseudospin](@entry_id:147053)-independent energy shift or "tilt" term, like $d_0(\mathbf{k})$, changes the energy dispersion to $E_{\pm}(\mathbf{k}) = d_0(\mathbf{k}) \pm |\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k})|$ but leaves the eigenvectors and the condition for the node's existence, $\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k}) = \mathbf{0}$, unchanged. Consequently, the [topological chirality](@entry_id:149735) of the node is unaffected by such a tilt [@problem_id:3024257].

The true physical meaning of this topological charge becomes apparent when we examine the geometry of the quantum states. The chirality of a Weyl node is identical to the **first Chern number**, a topological invariant calculated from the **Berry curvature** of one of the bands on a closed surface in momentum space that encloses the node. For a given band $n$, the Berry curvature $\boldsymbol{\Omega}_n(\mathbf{k})$ can be thought of as an emergent magnetic field in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936). The total flux of this "magnetic field" through a closed surface is quantized and is proportional to the Chern number $C_n$.
$\Phi_B = \oint_S \boldsymbol{\Omega}_n(\mathbf{k}) \cdot d\mathbf{S} = 2\pi C_n$

A Weyl node acts as a source or a sink—a monopole—of this Berry curvature. A direct calculation for the canonical Weyl Hamiltonian $H(\mathbf{q}) = \chi v \boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\mathbf{q}$ (where $\mathbf{q}$ is momentum measured from the node) reveals that the Berry curvature for the lower band is precisely that of a [magnetic monopole](@entry_id:149129) centered at the node [@problem_id:2870330]:
$\boldsymbol{\Omega}_{-}(\mathbf{q}) = \frac{\chi}{2} \frac{\mathbf{q}}{|\mathbf{q}|^3}$

Integrating this field over any sphere enclosing the origin yields a total Berry flux of $\Phi_B = 2\pi\chi$. This confirms that the Chern number on such a surface is equal to the node's chirality, $C = \chi$. Thus, a Weyl node with chirality $\chi=+1$ is a source of one quantum of Berry flux, while a node with $\chi=-1$ is a sink.

### Lattice Constraints: The Nielsen-Ninomiya Theorem

While the continuum Weyl Hamiltonian describes the physics near a node, the existence of an underlying crystal lattice imposes a powerful global constraint on the total number and [chirality](@entry_id:144105) of these nodes. This is articulated by the **Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem**, often called the "[fermion doubling](@entry_id:144782) theorem." In its [condensed matter](@entry_id:747660) incarnation, it states that for any local, periodic (translationally invariant), and Hermitian Hamiltonian, the sum of the chiralities of all Weyl nodes within the entire Brillouin zone must be zero [@problem_id:2870291]:
$\sum_{i} \chi_i = 0$

This theorem has a beautiful and intuitive [topological proof](@entry_id:177798). Due to lattice [periodicity](@entry_id:152486), the Brillouin zone is a compact manifold without a boundary (topologically a 3D torus, $T^3$). The Berry curvature $\boldsymbol{\Omega}(\mathbf{k})$ is well-defined everywhere except at the Weyl nodes, where it diverges. Away from these nodes, its divergence is zero. Applying the divergence theorem to the entire Brillouin zone, the integral of the divergence of $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$ over the BZ volume must equal the total flux of $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$ through its boundary. Since the BZ has no boundary, this total flux is identically zero. This integral can also be seen as the sum of fluxes from all the monopoles (Weyl nodes) contained within. For the total to be zero, the sum of the monopole charges—the chiralities—must vanish [@problem_id:2870291].

The immediate consequence of this theorem is profound: Weyl nodes in a crystal must always appear in pairs (or larger even-numbered sets) with opposite [chirality](@entry_id:144105). It is impossible to have a single, isolated Weyl node in the bulk of a crystalline material. This "doubling" is a fundamental property of periodic systems. It is important to note that the core assumptions of the theorem are locality and [translational invariance](@entry_id:195885). Time-reversal symmetry is not a necessary condition [@problem_id:2870291]. The theorem can be circumvented if one of its assumptions is broken, a key insight that explains, for instance, the existence of single Dirac cones on the surface of a [topological insulator](@entry_id:137103), where 3D [translational symmetry](@entry_id:171614) is broken.

### The Role of Symmetry: From Dirac to Weyl Semimetals

The requirement that Weyl nodes appear in pairs naturally leads to the question of what controls their location in the Brillouin zone. The answer lies in the crystal's symmetries, particularly **[inversion symmetry](@entry_id:269948) (P)** and **[time-reversal symmetry](@entry_id:138094) (T)**.

In some materials, a pair of Weyl nodes with opposite chirality may be forced by symmetry to exist at the exact same point in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936). This creates a more complex, four-fold degenerate [band crossing](@entry_id:161733) known as a **Dirac point**. Materials hosting such points are called **Dirac semimetals**. The stability of a Dirac point is protected by the *simultaneous* presence of both time-reversal and inversion symmetries [@problem_id:1827867]. In such systems, [time-reversal symmetry](@entry_id:138094) for spinful electrons guarantees that every energy band is at least two-fold degenerate at *every* point $\mathbf{k}$ in the Brillouin zone (Kramers' degeneracy). A Dirac point occurs when two of these Kramers-degenerate bands cross, a crossing protected by the additional [inversion symmetry](@entry_id:269948), resulting in a four-fold degeneracy [@problem_id:2870328]. Since a Dirac point can be viewed as a superposition of a $\chi=+1$ and a $\chi=-1$ Weyl node, its net chirality is zero, making it compatible with the constraints of $PT$ symmetry, which forces the Berry curvature to be zero everywhere.

This composite nature provides a powerful mechanism for generating Weyl semimetals. If a material is initially a Dirac semimetal, one can induce a phase transition to a Weyl semimetal by breaking one of the protecting symmetries.
-   Breaking [inversion symmetry](@entry_id:269948) ($P$) but preserving time-reversal ($T$) allows the two constituent Weyl nodes to separate in momentum space.
-   Breaking [time-reversal symmetry](@entry_id:138094) ($T$) but preserving inversion ($P$) also allows the nodes to split.

In either case, the single four-fold Dirac point resolves into a pair of two-fold degenerate Weyl points separated in momentum, with their chiralities summing to zero as required by the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem [@problem_id:1827852] [@problem_id:2870328].

### Spectroscopic Signatures: Fermi Arcs

The most celebrated and unambiguous experimental signature of a Weyl semimetal is the existence of exotic surface states known as **Fermi arcs**. Unlike conventional Fermi surfaces, which must form closed loops, Fermi arcs are open contours that terminate at the projection of bulk Weyl nodes onto the surface Brillouin zone.

The origin of Fermi arcs is a direct consequence of the **[bulk-boundary correspondence](@entry_id:137647)**, applied in a novel way. We can conceptualize the 3D Brillouin zone of the Weyl semimetal as a continuous stack of 2D momentum-space slices. For a surface normal to the $\hat{x}$ direction, for example, we can treat the momentum component $k_z$ as a parameter and view the system as a family of 2D Hamiltonians $H_{k_z}(k_x, k_y)$ [@problem_id:2870287].

Each 2D slice is gapped unless $k_z$ coincides with the momentum of a Weyl node. Therefore, for each gapped slice, we can compute a 2D Chern number, $C(k_z)$. This Chern number remains constant as $k_z$ is varied, but it jumps by an integer equal to the node's [chirality](@entry_id:144105) whenever $k_z$ crosses the position of a Weyl node.

Let's consider the simplest case of a Weyl semimetal with two nodes of opposite chirality, $\chi=+1$ at $k_z = -k_0$ and $\chi=-1$ at $k_z=+k_0$. For $|k_z| > k_0$, no nodes have been crossed, so the 2D slices are topologically trivial with $C(k_z)=0$. For the slices in the region $-k_0  k_z  k_0$, the Chern number is $C(k_z)=1$. According to the bulk-boundary correspondence for 2D [topological insulators](@entry_id:137834), a non-zero Chern number guarantees the existence of chiral states localized at the boundary. Thus, for every value of $k_z$ between $-k_0$ and $+k_0$, the surface must host a chiral surface state [@problem_id:2870287].

The collection of these states across the momentum range $-k_0  k_z  k_0$ forms a continuous band of surface states. The Fermi-level crossing of this band is the **Fermi arc**. This arc is necessarily an open contour because the surface states that form it only exist for the range of $k_z$ where the bulk slices are topologically non-trivial. The arc must terminate where the [surface states](@entry_id:137922) merge back into the bulk continuum, which occurs precisely at the momenta where the bulk gap closes: the Weyl nodes. Therefore, a Fermi arc is a topologically protected electronic state that connects the projections of two bulk Weyl nodes of opposite [chirality](@entry_id:144105) onto the surface Brillouin zone [@problem_id:3024294]. The geometry of the surface is crucial; if the Weyl nodes project onto the same point in the surface BZ, a stable Fermi arc cannot be formed between them [@problem_id:2870287].

It is important to contrast this with Dirac [semimetals](@entry_id:152277). Since a Dirac point has zero net [chirality](@entry_id:144105), the arguments based on a non-zero slice Chern number do not apply, and there is no universal guarantee of topologically protected Fermi arcs in Dirac semimetals [@problem_id:2870328].

### Classification: Type-I and Type-II Weyl Semimetals

The initial, idealized picture of a Weyl node features a symmetric, upright cone. However, in real materials, the Lorentz symmetry of [relativistic physics](@entry_id:188332) is absent, allowing for a "tilt" of the cone. This is captured by adding a term $\hbar\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{k}$ to the Weyl Hamiltonian:
$H(\mathbf{k}) = \hbar\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{k}\,\mathbb{I} + \hbar v\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\mathbf{k}$

The energy spectrum becomes $E_\pm(\mathbf{k}) = \hbar\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{k} \pm \hbar v|\mathbf{k}|$. The magnitude of the tilt vector $\mathbf{w}$ relative to the velocity $v$ leads to a crucial classification of Weyl nodes into two types [@problem_id:2870322].

**Type-I Weyl Semimetal**: When the tilt is small, $|w|  v$, the [band structure](@entry_id:139379) retains a conventional conical shape. At the energy of the Weyl node ($\mu=0$), the Fermi surface is a single point. The [density of states](@entry_id:147894) at the nodal energy is zero. For any small non-zero energy, the constant-energy surface is a closed pocket.

**Type-II Weyl Semimetal**: When the tilt is large, $|w| > v$, the cone is "over-tilted" to such an extent that it lies on its side. At the nodal energy ($\mu=0$), the conduction and valence bands both cross this energy level, creating coexisting electron and [hole pockets](@entry_id:269009) that touch at the Weyl node. The Fermi surface is no longer a point but an open, hyperbolic surface. This results in a finite [density of states](@entry_id:147894) at the nodal energy, a key distinction from the Type-I case.

The transition between Type-I and Type-II, which occurs when $|w|=v$, represents a change in the topology of the Fermi surface. Such a change, occurring without the closing of a band gap (as the Weyl node is always gapless), is known as a **Lifshitz transition** [@problem_id:2870322]. Crucially, the tilt term is proportional to the identity matrix and does not alter the Hamiltonian's eigenvectors. As the Berry curvature and the [topological chirality](@entry_id:149735) are derived from these eigenvectors, they remain invariant under any degree of tilt. The topological charge of a Weyl node is the same for Type-I and Type-II.
