The paraelectric phase is characterized by the absence of spontaneous polarization.\nLet us analyze the solutions. Since $\\alpha  0$ and $\\beta  0$:\n- If $T  T_{0}$, then the term $(T-T_{0})$ is positive. The expression for $P^2$ becomes negative, yielding no real non-zero solution for $P$.

The expression for $P^2$ becomes positive, yielding two real non-zero solutions $P = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha(T_{0}-T)}{2\\beta}}$. This corresponds to the ferroelectric phase with a non-zero spontaneous polarization.\nFrom this analysis, the critical temperature $T_c$ for the onset of spontaneous polarization in this model is $T_{0}$. The condition for being in the paraelectric phase is therefore $T  T_{0}$. In this regime, the equilibrium polarization at zero field is $P=0$.\n\nWe can now substitute $P=0$ into the expression for the differential susceptibility to obtain the linear susceptibility $\\chi(T)$ for $T  T_{0}$:\n$$\n\\chi(T) = \\left.\\frac{1}{2\\alpha\\,(T-T_{0}) + 12\\beta\\,P^{2}}\\right|_{P=0} = \\frac{1}{2\\alpha\\,(T-T_{0})}\n$$\nThis is the Curie-Weiss law for the dielectric susceptibility above the transition temperature.\n\nThe validity of this result is subject to both thermodynamic and physical conditions.\nThermodynamically, the equilibrium state must be stable, meaning it corresponds to a local minimum of the free energy, not a maximum. The condition for stability is that the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the order parameter must be positive:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial P^2}  0\n$$\nCalculating this second derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial P^2} = 2\\alpha\\,(T-T_{0}) + 12\\beta\\,P^{2}\n$$\nFor the paraelectric state ($T  T_0$) at zero field ($E=0$), we have $P=0$.

This confirms the thermodynamic self-consistency of the solution.\n\nThe physical conditions for the validity of the result are those inherent to the Landau model and the problem statement:\n$1$. The temperature $T$ must be greater than the critical temperature $T_0$.\n$2$. The system must be close enough to the phase transition for the truncated power series expansion of the free energy to be a valid approximation. However, the result neglects critical fluctuations, so it is not valid in the immediate vicinity of $T_0$ where fluctuations dominate. This is a mean-field theory result.\n$3$. The analysis assumes a spatially uniform, single-domain state and neglects contributions from domain walls, defects, and surface effects such as depolarizing fields.\n$4$.
