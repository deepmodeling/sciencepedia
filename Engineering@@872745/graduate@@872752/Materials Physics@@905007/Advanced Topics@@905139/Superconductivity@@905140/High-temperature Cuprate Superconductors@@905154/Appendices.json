The language is objective and precise. The problem is not trivial, as it requires the application of elementary probability theory to construct a physical model from first principles.\n\nStep 3: Verdict\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by executing the three specified tasks in order.\n\nTask 1: Derivation of the active fraction in the random limit.\nLet us consider an infinite one-dimensional chain of potential oxygen sites. The probability that any given site, indexed by $i$, is occupied is $P(O_i) = y$. The probability that it is unoccupied is $P(U_i) = 1-y$. The occupations of different sites are statistically independent in this random limit.\n\nA site $i$ is defined as \"charge-transfer active\" if it is occupied ($O_i$) and at least one of its nearest neighbors ($i-1$ or $i+1$) is also occupied. Let $A_i$ be the event that site $i$ is active. Mathematically, this corresponds to the composite event $A_i = O_i \\cap (O_{i-1} \\cup O_{i+1})$.\n\nThe fraction of chain oxygen sites that are \"charge-transfer active\", which we denote as $F_{rand}(y)$, is the probability $P(A_i)$ for any site $i$. Due to the independence of site occupations, we can write:\n$$\nP(A_i) = P(O_i) \\times P(O_{i-1} \\cup O_{i+1})\n$$\nThe probability of the union is found using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n$$\nP(O_{i-1} \\cup O_{i+1}) = P(O_{i-1}) + P(O_{i+1}) - P(O_{i-1} \\cap O_{i+1})\n$$\nGiven independence, $P(O_{i-1} \\cap O_{i+1}) = P(O_{i-1})P(O_{i+1}) = y \\cdot y = y^2$.\nThus,\n$$\nP(O_{i-1} \\cup O_{i+1}) = y + y - y^2 = 2y - y^2\n$$\nSubstituting this back, we find the fraction of active sites in the random limit:\n$$\nF_{rand}(y) = P(A_i) = y(2y - y^2) = 2y^2 - y^3\n$$\nThis can be written as $F_{rand}(y) = y^2(2-y)$.\n\nTask 2: Derivation of the hole doping relation $p(y,s)$.\nFirst, we establish the active fraction in the perfectly ordered limit ($s=1$), denoted $F_{ord}(y)$. The problem states that in this limit, all occupied chain sites are active. Per formula unit, there are $y$ occupied oxygen sites on the chain. Therefore, the number of active sites per formula unit is $y$. The \"active fraction\" in this context is the number of active sites per formula unit, so $F_{ord}(y) = y$.\n\nNext, we construct the active fraction for a partially ordered state, $F(y,s)$, by linear interpolation between the random limit ($s=0$) and the ordered limit ($s=1$):\n$$\nF(y,s) = (1-s) F_{rand}(y) + s F_{ord}(y)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $F_{rand}(y)$ and $F_{ord}(y)$:\n$$\nF(y,s) = (1-s)(2y^2 - y^3) + sy = (1-s)y^2(2-y) + sy\n$$\nThe problem states that the number of holes transferred per formula unit, $N_h$, is proportional to this active fraction: $N_h(y,s) = C \\cdot F(y,s)$, where $C$ is a proportionality constant.\n\nThe planar hole doping, $p$, is the number of holes per planar copper atom. Since there are two $\\mathrm{CuO_2}$ planes and thus two planar copper atoms per formula unit, we have:\n$$\np(y,s) = \\frac{N_h(y,s)}{2} = \\frac{C}{2} F(y,s) = K F(y,s)\n$$\nwhere $K = C/2$ is a new constant. To determine $K$, we use the empirical constraint that for a fully oxygenated ($y=1$) and perfectly ordered ($s=1$) sample, the doping is $p(1,1) \\approx 0.19$.\nWe evaluate $F(1,1)$:\n$$\nF(1,1) = (1-1) \\cdot 1^2(2-1) + 1 \\cdot 1 = 0 + 1 = 1\n$$\nThus, $p(1,1) = K \\cdot F(1,1) = K \\cdot 1 = K$. This gives $K = 0.19$.\n\nThe final closed-form expression for the hole doping is:\n$$\np(y,s) = 0.19 \\left[ (1-s)y^2(2-y) + sy \\right]\n$$\n\nTask 3: Numerical computation for a specific sample.\nWe are asked to compute the value of $p$ for a sample with oxygen content $y=0.62$ and ordering parameter $s=0.80$. We substitute these values into our derived formula:\n$$\np(0.62, 0.80) = 0.19 \\left[ (1-0.80)(0.62)^2(2-0.62) + (0.80)(0.62) \\right]\n$$\nLet us compute the terms inside the brackets.\nThe random contribution term:\n$$\n(1-s)y^2(2-y) = (0.20) \\cdot (0.62)^2 \\cdot (2 - 0.62) = 0.20 \\cdot 0.3844 \\cdot 1.38 = 0.1060944\n$$\nThe ordered contribution term:\n$$\nsy = 0.80 \\cdot 0.62 = 0.496\n$$\nThe total active fraction $F(0.62, 0.80)$ is the sum of these two terms:\n$$\nF(0.62, 0.80) = 0.1060944 + 0.496 = 0.6020944\n$$\nFinally, we compute the hole doping $p$:\n$$\np = 0.19 \\times F(0.62, 0.80) = 0.19 \\times 0.6020944 = 0.114397936\n$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures, as required, we obtain $p \\approx 0.1144$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.1144}\n$$", "id": "2828379"}, {"introduction": "A defining feature of cuprate superconductors is their $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave pairing symmetry, which leads to a superconducting gap that vanishes at four 'nodal' points on the Fermi surface.

Define the nodal Fermi velocity $v_{F}$ by $v_{F}=\\frac{1}{\\hbar}|\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}}\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}|_{\\mathbf{k}_{0}}$ and the gap slope velocity $v_{\\Delta}$ by $v_{\\Delta}=\\frac{1}{\\hbar}\\left|\\frac{\\partial \\Delta_{\\mathbf{k}}}{\\partial k_{\\parallel}}\\right|_{\\mathbf{k}_{0}}$, where $k_{\\parallel}$ is the tangential component along the Fermi surface.\n\nStarting from these definitions and the BdG Hamiltonian, do the following:\n\n- Linearize the BdG Hamiltonian in $\\mathbf{q}$ about $\\mathbf{k}_{0}$ and show that the quasiparticle dispersion is described by anisotropic Dirac cones characterized by $v_{F}$ and $v_{\\Delta}$.\n- Using only the fundamental definition of the density of states per unit area, $N(E)$, as the number of single-quasiparticle states at energy $E$ per unit energy per unit area, and counting contributions from all inequivalent nodes and both spin projections, derive the low-energy density of states $N(E)$ in closed form in terms of $E$, $v_{F}$, $v_{\\Delta}$, and $\\hbar$.\n\nExpress your final result as a single analytic expression for $N(E)$ valid at low energies, including the full prefactor and correct degeneracy factors from $4$ nodal points and $2$ spin projections. Express $N(E)$ per unit area of a single $\\mathrm{CuO}_{2}$ plane in units of states per energy per area. Your final answer must be a single closed-form expression. If you use absolute values, write them explicitly.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It poses a standard, non-trivial calculation in the theory of unconventional superconductivity based on the Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) mean-field theory and the Bogoliubov–de Gennes (BdG) formalism. All necessary definitions and physical constraints are provided, and no contradictions or ambiguities are present. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe system is a two-dimensional, single-particle Hamiltonian for quasiparticles in a superconductor, described in the Nambu basis $(\\psi_{\\mathbf{k}\\uparrow}, \\psi_{-\\mathbf{k}\\downarrow}^{\\dagger})^{T}$. The BdG Hamiltonian is given by:\n$$\nH_{\\text{BdG}}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}  \\Delta_{\\mathbf{k}} \\\\ \\Delta_{\\mathbf{k}}^{*}  -\\xi_{-\\mathbf{k}} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nAssuming a crystal with inversion symmetry, the normal-state dispersion is even in momentum, $\\xi_{-\\mathbf{k}}=\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}$. For a singlet d-wave superconductor, the gap function is real, so $\\Delta_{\\mathbf{k}}^{*}=\\Delta_{\\mathbf{k}}$. The Hamiltonian simplifies to:\n$$\nH_{\\text{BdG}}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}\\tau_{z} + \\Delta_{\\mathbf{k}}\\tau_{x}\n$$\nwhere $\\tau_x$ and $\\tau_z$ are Pauli matrices operating in Nambu space. The eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian are the quasiparticle energies, given by:\n$$\nE_{\\mathbf{k}} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}^2 + \\Delta_{\\mathbf{k}}^2}\n$$\nWe are concerned with low-energy quasiparticle excitations, which exist near the nodal points $\\mathbf{k}_{0}$ on the Fermi surface where both the normal-state energy and the gap vanish: $\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}_{0}}=0$ and $\\Delta_{\\mathbf{k}_{0}}=0$. We expand $\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}$ and $\\Delta_{\\mathbf{k}}$ for small deviations in momentum $\\mathbf{q} = \\mathbf{k} - \\mathbf{k}_{0}$ around a single node.\n\nA first-order Taylor expansion yields:\n$$\n\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}} = \\xi_{\\mathbf{k}_{0}} + \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}}\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}|_{\\mathbf{k}_{0}} \\cdot \\mathbf{q} + \\mathcal{O}(|\\mathbf{q}|^2) \\approx \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}}\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}|_{\\mathbf{k}_{0}} \\cdot \\mathbf{q}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathbf{k}} = \\Delta_{\\mathbf{k}_{0}} + \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}}\\Delta_{\\mathbf{k}}|_{\\mathbf{k}_{0}} \\cdot \\mathbf{q} + \\mathcal{O}(|\\mathbf{q}|^2) \\approx \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}}\\Delta_{\\mathbf{k}}|_{\\mathbf{k}_{0}} \\cdot \\mathbf{q}\n$$\nWe use the local orthonormal coordinate system $(q_1, q_2)$, where $q_1$ is normal to the Fermi surface and $q_2$ is tangential. The gradient $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}}\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}$ is always normal to the constant-energy surface, so at the Fermi surface it points in the $q_1$ direction. Using the definition of the nodal Fermi velocity, $v_{F} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar}|\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}}\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}|_{\\mathbf{k}_{0}}$, we can write:\n$$\n\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}} \\approx (\\hbar v_F) q_1\n$$\nHere, the sign of $q_1$ can be chosen appropriately. For a $d_{x^2-y^2}$ gap, the gap function $\\Delta_{\\mathbf{k}}$ changes sign across the nodal line, and its gradient at the node is predominantly perpendicular to the gradient of $\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}$. The problem defines the gap slope velocity $v_{\\Delta}$ in terms of the derivative along the Fermi surface tangent, which is the $q_2$ direction. This implies that the gradient of the gap is primarily along the $q_2$ direction at the node. Using the definition $v_{\\Delta}=\\frac{1}{\\hbar}\\left|\\frac{\\partial \\Delta_{\\mathbf{k}}}{\\partial k_{\\parallel}}\\right|_{\\mathbf{k}_{0}}$, where $k_{\\parallel}$ corresponds to $q_2$, we have:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathbf{k}} \\approx (\\hbar v_{\\Delta}) q_2\n$$\nAgain, the sign can be absorbed into the choice of direction for the $q_2$ axis.\n\nSubstituting these linearized forms into the energy expression, the low-energy quasiparticle dispersion near a node is:\n$$\nE(\\mathbf{q}) = \\sqrt{(\\hbar v_{F} q_{1})^2 + (\\hbar v_{\\Delta} q_{2})^2}\n$$\nThis equation describes a cone in the energy-momentum space with an elliptical cross-section. This is the characteristic dispersion of an anisotropic Dirac cone, with effective \"light speeds\" given by $v_F$ and $v_{\\Delta}$ along the two principal axes in momentum space. This completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we derive the low-energy density of states (DOS) per unit area, $N(E)$. The fundamental definition of $N(E)$ is the number of states per unit energy per unit area. We use the method of calculating the integrated DOS, which is the total number of states $\\mathcal{N}$ with energy less than $E$ (for $E0$), and then differentiating with respect to $E$.\nThe total number of states $\\mathcal{N}(E)$ is obtained by summing over all available quantum numbers (spin and momentum) within the energy shell defined by $E$.\nFor a 2D system of area $A$, the number of available momentum states in a region of k-space of area $\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathbf{k}}$ is $A \\frac{\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathbf{k}}}{(2\\pi)^2}$.\nThe low-energy states are located near the nodes. A $d_{x^2-y^2}$ superconductor on a simple tetragonal lattice possesses four symmetry-equivalent nodes. The calculation must account for spin degeneracy (factor of $g_s=2$) and the number of nodes (factor of $g_{node}=4$).\nThe condition $E(\\mathbf{q}) \\le E$ for a single node is:\n$$\n\\sqrt{(\\hbar v_{F} q_{1})^2 + (\\hbar v_{\\Delta} q_{2})^2} \\le E\n$$\nThis inequality describes the interior of an ellipse in the $(q_1, q_2)$ plane with semi-axes $a = \\frac{E}{\\hbar v_F}$ and $b = \\frac{E}{\\hbar v_{\\Delta}}$. The area of this ellipse is $\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathbf{q}} = \\pi a b = \\pi \\frac{E^2}{\\hbar^2 v_F v_{\\Delta}}$.\nThe total number of states with energy up to $E$ is found by multiplying this phase space area by the degeneracy factors and the phase space density:\n$$\n\\mathcal{N}(E) = g_{s} \\cdot g_{node} \\cdot A \\cdot \\frac{\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathbf{q}}}{(2\\pi)^2}\n$$\nSubstituting the values $g_s=2$, $g_{node}=4$, and the area $\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathbf{q}}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{N}(E) = (2)(4) \\frac{A}{(2\\pi)^2} \\left( \\frac{\\pi E^2}{\\hbar^2 v_F v_{\\Delta}} \\right) = \\frac{8A}{4\\pi^2} \\frac{\\pi E^2}{\\hbar^2 v_F v_{\\Delta}} = \\frac{2A E^2}{\\pi \\hbar^2 v_F v_{\\Delta}}\n$$\nThe DOS per unit area, $N(E)$, is obtained by differentiating $\\mathcal{N}(E)$ with respect to $E$ and dividing by the area $A$:\n$$\nN(E) = \\frac{1}{A} \\frac{d\\mathcal{N}(E)}{dE} = \\frac{1}{A} \\frac{d}{dE} \\left( \\frac{2A E^2}{\\pi \\hbar^2 v_F v_{\\Delta}} \\right) = \\frac{4E}{\\pi \\hbar^2 v_F v_{\\Delta}}\n$$\nThis result is valid for positive energies $E0$. The BdG spectrum is symmetric about $E=0$, having both particle-like ($+E_{\\mathbf{k}}$) and hole-like ($-E_{\\mathbf{k}}$) branches. The density of states must therefore be an even function of energy, $N(-E) = N(E)$. To capture both positive and negative low-energy excitations relative to the chemical potential, we must use the absolute value of the energy.\n$$\nN(E) = \\frac{4|E|}{\\pi \\hbar^2 v_F v_{\\Delta}}\n$$\nThis linear dependence of the density of states on energy is a hallmark experimental signature of a superconductor with line nodes in its gap structure, such as d-wave cuprates.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\frac{4|E|}{\\pi \\hbar^{2} v_{F} v_{\\Delta}} } $$", "id": "2828436"}]}
