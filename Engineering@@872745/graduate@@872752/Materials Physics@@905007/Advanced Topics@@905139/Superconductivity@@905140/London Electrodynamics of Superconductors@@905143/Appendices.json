It represents a standard, fundamental problem in the physics of superconductivity. We may proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe analysis begins with the relevant fundamental laws for magnetostatics and superconductivity.

For a static scenario, the relevant equation is the second London equation. In the London gauge, it relates the superconducting current density $\\mathbf{J}_s$ to the magnetic vector potential $\\mathbf{A}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}_s = -\\frac{n_s q^2}{m} \\mathbf{A}\n$$\nwhere $n_s$ is the number density of superconducting charge carriers with charge $q$ and effective mass $m$. The London penetration depth, $\\lambda$, is defined by\n$$\n\\lambda^2 = \\frac{m}{\\mu_0 n_s q^2}\n$$\nThe London equation can thus be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}_s = -\\frac{1}{\\mu_0 \\lambda^2} \\mathbf{A}\n$$\nInside the superconductor, the total current density $\\mathbf{J}$ is the supercurrent density $\\mathbf{J}_s$.

The external magnetic field is parallel to the surface at $x=0$ and points along the $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ direction. Due to the specified translational invariance along $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ inside the superconductor can only depend on the coordinate $x$, and it must be directed along $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$.

The vector differential equation thus simplifies to a scalar ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the component $B(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 B(x)}{dx^2} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} B(x) = 0\n$$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is $r^2 - 1/\\lambda^2 = 0$, which has roots $r_1 = 1/\\lambda$ and $r_2 = -1/\\lambda$. The general solution is therefore:\n$$\nB(x) = C_1 \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) + C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are integration constants determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nThe first boundary condition states that the magnetic induction vanishes deep inside the superconductor:\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to+\\infty} B(x) = 0\n$$\nAs $x \\to +\\infty$, the term $\\exp(x/\\lambda)$ grows without bound. For the limit to be zero, its coefficient must be zero, so we must have $C_1 = 0$. The solution is then reduced to:\n$$\nB(x) = C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\nThe second boundary condition specifies the value of the magnetic induction at the surface $x=0^{+}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}(0^{+}) = B_0 \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\n$$\nThis implies that the scalar component $B(x)$ at $x=0$ must be $B_0$.

Let $f_n$ be the free energy density of the material in the normal state. The superconducting state is thermodynamically stable because its free energy density, $f_s$, is lower than $f_n$. The difference in free energy density between the normal and superconducting states in the absence of fields or currents is the condensation energy density, $u_0$. Thus, the free energy density of the superconducting state at rest is $f_s(0) = f_n - u_0$.\n\nWhen a supercurrent $\\mathbf{j}_s$ flows, the charge carriers acquire a drift velocity $\\mathbf{v}_s$, and thus possess kinetic energy. The kinetic energy density of this superflow is given as $u_k = \\frac{1}{2} n_s m v_s^2$. This kinetic energy adds to the free energy of the superconducting state. The free energy density of the current-carrying superconducting state is therefore:\n$$ f_s(\\mathbf{j}_s) = f_s(0) + u_k = f_n - u_0 + u_k $$\nThe superconducting state remains the thermodynamically preferred state as long as its free energy is lower than that of the normal state, i.e., $f_s(\\mathbf{j}_s)  f_n$. Substituting the expression for $f_s(\\mathbf{j}_s)$:\n$$ f_n - u_0 + u_k  f_n $$\nThis inequality simplifies to $u_k  u_0$. Superconductivity is destroyed when it ceases to be energetically favorable. The critical condition, known as depairing, is reached when the kinetic energy of the superflow equals the condensation energy that stabilizes the superconducting phase. At this threshold, the system transitions to the normal state.
