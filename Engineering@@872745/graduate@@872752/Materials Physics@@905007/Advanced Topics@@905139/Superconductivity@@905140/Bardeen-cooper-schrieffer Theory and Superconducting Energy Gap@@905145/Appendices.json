This signifies that a Cooper pair is not a tightly bound object confined to a single lattice site; rather, its constituent electrons are, on average, separated by a large distance covering thousands of other electrons and ions. Many Cooper pairs overlap within a single \"coherence volume\" of size $\\sim\\xi_0^3$. This extensive overlap forces the pairs to act collectively, establishing a macroscopic quantum-mechanical phase coherence.

Let this be $a+ib$. Our convention $\\Im(\\Omega)0$ implies that for $E0$, both $\\Re(\\Omega)$ and $\\Im(\\Omega)$ must be positive. This corresponds to $a0$ and $b0$.\n$$ (a+ib)^2 = a^{2}-b^{2}+2iab = -1+2ir $$\nEquating real and imaginary parts:\n$$ a^{2}-b^{2} = -1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2ab = 2r \\implies ab=r $$\nSubstituting $b=r/a$ into the first equation:\n$$ a^{2} - \\frac{r^{2}}{a^{2}} = -1 \\implies a^{4} + a^{2} - r^{2} = 0 $$\nSolving the quadratic equation for $a^{2}$:\n$$ a^{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-4(1)(-r^{2})}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1+4r^{2}}}{2} $$\nSince $a$ is real, $a^{2}$ must be positive. We take the positive root:\n$$ a^{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1+4r^{2}}-1}{2} \\implies a = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{1+4r^{2}}-1}{2}} $$\nAlso, $b^{2} = a^{2}+1$:\n$$ b^{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1+4r^{2}}+1}{2} \\implies b = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{1+4r^{2}}+1}{2}} $$\nNow we evaluate the real part of $\\frac{r+i}{a+ib}$:\n$$ \\Re\\left(\\frac{(r+i)(a-ib)}{a^{2}+b^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{ra+b}{a^{2}+b^{2}} $$\nThe denominator is $a^{2}+b^{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1+4r^{2}}-1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{1+4r^{2}}+1}{2} = \\sqrt{1+4r^{2}}$.\nSo, we have:\n$$ \\frac{N_{s}(\\Delta,\\Gamma)}{N_{0}} = \\frac{ra+b}{\\sqrt{1+4r^{2}}} = \\frac{r\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{1+4r^{2}}-1}{2}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{1+4r^{2}}+1}{2}}}{\\sqrt{1+4r^{2}}} $$\nSubstituting $r=15$:\n$$ \\sqrt{1+4(15)^{2}} = \\sqrt{1+4(225)} = \\sqrt{901} $$\nThe expression becomes:\n$$ \\frac{N_{s}}{N_{0}} = \\frac{15\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{901}-1}{2}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{901}+1}{2}}}{\\sqrt{901}} $$\nNumerically:\n$$ \\sqrt{901} \\approx 30.016662 $$\n$$ a = \\sqrt{\\frac{30.016662-1}{2}} = \\sqrt{14.508331} \\approx 3.808980 $$\n$$ b = \\sqrt{\\frac{30.016662+1}{2}} = \\sqrt{15.508331} \\approx 3.938062 $$\nThe numerator is $15a+b \\approx 15(3.808980) + 3.938062 = 57.134700 + 3.938062 = 61.072762$.\nThe value is $\\frac{61.072762}{30.016662} \\approx 2.034615$.\nRounding to four significant figures gives $2.035$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.035}$$", "id": "2802562"}]}
