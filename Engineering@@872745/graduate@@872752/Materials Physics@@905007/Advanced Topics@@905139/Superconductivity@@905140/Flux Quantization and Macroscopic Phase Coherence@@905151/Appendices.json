Here, $n_s^*(\\mathbf{r})$ is the number density of the superconducting charge carriers, which are Cooper pairs, and $\\theta(\\mathbf{r})$ represents the coherent phase of the condensate. The charge of a Cooper pair is $q^* = 2e$.\n\nThe electrical supercurrent density, $\\mathbf{J}_s$, for charge carriers of charge $q^*$ and mass $m^*$ in the presence of a magnetic vector potential $\\mathbf{A}$ is given by the London equation:\n$$ \\mathbf{J}_s = \\frac{n_s^* q^*}{m^*} (\\hbar \\nabla\\theta - q^* \\mathbf{A}) $$\nThis equation connects the supercurrent density to the macroscopic properties of the condensate (phase gradient $\\nabla\\theta$) and the electromagnetic field (vector potential $\\mathbf{A}$).\n\nThe problem specifies a thick-walled superconducting ring. This allows for the selection of a closed integration contour, denoted as $C$, that lies deep within the superconducting material, where the cross-sectional dimensions are much larger than the London penetration depth. Due to the Meissner effect, the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ is expelled from the bulk of the superconductor. Consequently, deep inside the material, far from any surfaces, any screening supercurrents have decayed to zero. Therefore, along this specific contour $C$, the supercurrent density $\\mathbf{J}_s$ is zero. Setting $\\mathbf{J}_s = 0$ in the equation above gives:\n$$ \\hbar \\nabla\\theta - q^* \\mathbf{A} = 0 $$\n$$ \\implies \\nabla\\theta = \\frac{q^*}{\\hbar} \\mathbf{A} $$\nWe now integrate this equation along the closed contour $C$ that encircles the hole of the ring:\n$$ \\oint_C \\nabla\\theta \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = \\oint_C \\frac{q^*}{\\hbar} \\mathbf{A} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} $$\n\nThe left-hand side of this equation is the total change in the phase, $\\Delta\\theta$, after one full traversal of the loop. A fundamental requirement for the order parameter $\\Psi(\\mathbf{r})$ is that it must be single-valued at every point in space. This means that after completing a closed loop, the phase $\\theta$ can only change by an integer multiple of $2\\pi$:\n$$ \\oint_C \\nabla\\theta \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = \\Delta\\theta = 2\\pi n, \\quad \\text{where } n \\in \\mathbb{Z} $$\n\nThe right-hand side of the integrated equation involves the line integral of the vector potential $\\mathbf{A}$. According to Stokes' theorem, this line integral is equal to the magnetic flux, $\\Phi$, passing through the surface $S$ bounded by the contour $C$:\n$$ \\oint_C \\mathbf{A} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = \\int_S (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}) \\cdot d\\mathbf{S} = \\int_S \\mathbf{B} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S} = \\Phi $$\nThis flux $\\Phi$ corresponds to the total magnetic flux trapped inside the hole of the superconducting ring.\n\nBy equating the results for the left and right sides of the integrated equation, we arrive at the condition for flux quantization:\n$$ 2\\pi n = \\frac{q^*}{\\hbar} \\Phi $$\nSolving for the flux $\\Phi$, we get:\n$$ \\Phi = n \\left( \\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{q^*} \\right) $$\nThe charge carriers are Cooper pairs, so $q^* = 2e$. We also use the definition of the Planck constant, $h = 2\\pi\\hbar$. Substituting these values gives the final quantization condition:\n$$ \\Phi = n \\left( \\frac{h}{2e} \\right) $$\nThis result demonstrates that the magnetic flux linked by a superconducting ring is not continuous but is quantized in integer multiples of a fundamental unit.

A SQUID is fundamentally a magnetometer built around a superconducting loop containing one or more Josephson junctions. The total magnetic flux threading the loop is constrained by the physics of the device, leading to a periodic response to external magnetic fields. This quantum constraint means that the screening current $I_s$, and consequently the voltage and critical current of the SQUID, respond to the external flux in a periodic manner. The period of this response is precisely one flux quantum, $\\Phi_0$. This periodic dependence allows for the measurement of extremely small changes in magnetic flux, often a tiny fraction of $\\Phi_0$, making SQUIDs the most sensitive magnetometers currently available.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.067834 \\times 10^{-15}}$$", "id": "2824081"}, {"introduction": "With the flux quantum $\\Phi_0$ established [@problem_id:2824081], we can now analyze its impact on a physical system.

The problem states that the gauge-invariant single-valuedness of the wavefunction implies fluxoid quantization. The specific form of this quantization rule is given by the sign convention: the external flux $\\Phi$ and the self-induced flux, taken as $-LI$, must sum to an integer multiple of the flux quantum $\\Phi_0$. The flux quantum for a Cooper pair is $\\Phi_0 = h/(2e)$. The quantization condition for the fluxoid sector labeled by the integer $n$ is thus:\n$$ \\Phi - LI = n\\Phi_0 $$\nThis equation determines the persistent current $I$ that must flow in the ring for a given external flux $\\Phi$ and for a given quantum state $n$. We can solve for this current, which we denote $I_n(\\Phi)$:\n$$ I_n(\\Phi) = \\frac{\\Phi - n\\Phi_0}{L} $$\nThis is the expression for the persistent current in the sector $n$. A positive current corresponds to a state where the external flux $\\Phi$ is greater than the trapped fluxoid $n\\Phi_0$.\n\nNext, we derive the free energy $E_n(\\Phi)$ of the ring. The problem states that the total electromagnetic plus kinetic energy stored by the persistent current can be described by an effective self-inductance $L$. The energy stored in an inductor is quadratic in the current. The standard expression for this energy is:\n$$ E = \\frac{1}{2}LI^2 $$\nThis expression represents the energy of the superconducting ring system itself. To find the energy of the ring in the specific quantum state $n$, we substitute the expression for the current $I_n(\\Phi)$ into this energy formula.\n$$ E_n(\\Phi) = \\frac{1}{2}L \\left( I_n(\\Phi) \\right)^2 $$\nSubstituting the expression for $I_n(\\Phi)$:\n$$ E_n(\\Phi) = \\frac{1}{2}L \\left( \\frac{\\Phi - n\\Phi_0}{L} \\right)^2 = \\frac{L}{2L^2}(\\Phi - n\\Phi_0)^2 $$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the free energy of the $n$-th state as a function of the external flux:\n$$ E_n(\\Phi) = \\frac{(\\Phi - n\\Phi_0)^2}{2L} $$\nThis energy is a parabolic function of the external flux $\\Phi$, with its minimum at $\\Phi = n\\Phi_0$.\n\nThe problem requests that the current $I(\\Phi)$ be computed. This can be rigorously cross-checked using the fundamental thermodynamic relation between current and free energy. In a system where the external flux is a control parameter, the work done on the system for an infinitesimal change $d\\Phi$ is $dW = I d\\Phi$. For a reversible process, this corresponds to a change in free energy, $dE = I d\\Phi$. This implies the relation:\n$$ I = \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\Phi} $$\nApplying this relation to our derived free energy $E_n(\\Phi)$:\n$$ I_n(\\Phi) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\Phi} \\left( \\frac{(\\Phi - n\\Phi_0)^2}{2L} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2L} \\cdot 2(\\Phi - n\\Phi_0) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\Phi}(\\Phi - n\\Phi_0) = \\frac{\\Phi - n\\Phi_0}{L} $$\nThis result is identical to the expression for the current derived directly from the fluxoid quantization condition.

The core size is characterized by the superconducting coherence length, $\\xi$, which is the length scale over which the order parameter $\\psi$ can vary significantly. This scale arises from the competition between the condensation energy terms, $\\alpha|\\psi|^2 + \\frac{\\beta}{2}|\\psi|^4$, which favor a uniform $|\\psi|$, and the kinetic energy term, $\\frac{1}{2m^\\ast}|(-i\\hbar\\nabla - 2e\\mathbf{A})\\psi|^2$, which penalizes spatial variations of $\\psi$.

In a region where $\\psi$ is recovering from zero, we can approximate the balance by comparing the linear term in $\\psi$ with the kinetic term. Let us consider a field-free case ($\\mathbf{A}=0$) for simplicity to extract the length scale inherent to $\\psi$. The relevant terms are $\\alpha\\psi$ and $-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^\\ast}\\nabla^2\\psi$. Equating the magnitudes of these terms defines the characteristic length scale $\\xi$:\n$$|\\alpha||\\psi| \\sim \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^\\ast\\xi^2}|\\psi|$$\nGiven that $\\alpha < 0$ in the superconducting state, we have $|\\alpha| = -\\alpha$.
