The boundaries of this cell are formed by the perpendicular bisectors of the vectors connecting the central lattice point to all other lattice points. The cell itself is the smallest area enclosed by these bisectors.\n\nFirst, we must identify the nearest-neighbor lattice points to the origin. A general lattice point is given by a vector $\\mathbf{R} = n_{1}\\mathbf{a}_{1} + n_{2}\\mathbf{a}_{2}$, where $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ are integers. The nearest neighbors are the set of points with the smallest non-zero magnitude $|\\mathbf{R}|$.\nThe primitive vectors given are $\\mathbf{a}_{1} = a(1,0)$ and $\\mathbf{a}_{2} = a\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$. Both have magnitude $a$.\nLet us identify the vectors pointing from the origin to its six nearest neighbors. These are:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{R}_{1} &= \\mathbf{a}_{1} = a(1, 0) \\\\\n\\mathbf{R}_{2} &= \\mathbf{a}_{2} = a\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) \\\\\n\\mathbf{R}_{3} &= -\\mathbf{a}_{1} + \\mathbf{a}_{2} = a\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) \\\\\n\\mathbf{R}_{4} &= -\\mathbf{a}_{1} = a(-1, 0) \\\\\n\\mathbf{R}_{5} &= -\\mathbf{a}_{2} = a\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) \\\\\n\\mathbf{R}_{6} &= \\mathbf{a}_{1} - \\mathbf{a}_{2} = a\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nAll six of these vectors have a magnitude of $a$. There are no other lattice points closer to the origin. These six vectors are separated by angles of $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ radians or $60^{\\circ}$, forming a regular hexagon. The Wigner–Seitz cell is bounded by the perpendicular bisectors of these six vectors.\n\nLet us find the equations of the lines corresponding to these perpendicular bisectors.\n1. For $\\mathbf{R}_{1} = a(1, 0)$: The midpoint is $\\left(\\frac{a}{2}, 0\\right)$. The bisector is a vertical line: $x = \\frac{a}{2}$.\n2. For $\\mathbf{R}_{4} = a(-1, 0)$: The midpoint is $\\left(-\\frac{a}{2}, 0\\right)$. The bisector is a vertical line: $x = -\\frac{a}{2}$.\n3. For $\\mathbf{R}_{2} = a\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$: The midpoint is $\\left(\\frac{a}{4}, \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)$. The line equation is given by $\\mathbf{R}_{2} \\cdot \\left(\\mathbf{r} - \\frac{\\mathbf{R}_{2}}{2}\\right) = 0$, where $\\mathbf{r}=(x,y)$. This simplifies to $\\mathbf{R}_{2} \\cdot \\mathbf{r} = \\frac{|\\mathbf{R}_{2}|^2}{2}$.\n$$\na\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)x + a\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)y = \\frac{a^2}{2} \\implies x + \\sqrt{3}y = a\n$$\n4. For $\\mathbf{R}_{3} = a\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$: Similarly, $-\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}y = \\frac{a}{2} \\implies -x + \\sqrt{3}y = a$.\n5. For $\\mathbf{R}_{5} = a\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$: Similarly, $-\\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}y = \\frac{a}{2} \\implies -x - \\sqrt{3}y = a$.\n6. For $\\mathbf{R}_{6} = a\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$: Similarly, $\\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}y = \\frac{a}{2} \\implies x - \\sqrt{3}y = a$.\n\nThe Wigner–Seitz cell is the region enclosed by these six lines. The shape is a hexagon. To determine if it is a regular hexagon, we find its vertices and calculate the side length.\nThe vertices are the intersection points of adjacent lines. Let's find one vertex by intersecting $x = \\frac{a}{2}$ and $x + \\sqrt{3}y = a$:\n$$\n\\frac{a}{2} + \\sqrt{3}y = a \\implies \\sqrt{3}y = \\frac{a}{2} \\implies y = \\frac{a}{2\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\nSo, one vertex is $V_{1} = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$.\nLet's find the next vertex by intersecting $x + \\sqrt{3}y = a$ and $-x + \\sqrt{3}y = a$:\nAdding the two equations gives $2\\sqrt{3}y = 2a \\implies y = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}$. Substituting this back gives $x + \\sqrt{3}\\left(\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = a \\implies x+a=a \\implies x=0$.\nSo, the second vertex is $V_{2} = \\left(0, \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$.\n\nThe length $s$ of the side connecting $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ is:\n$$\ns = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{a}{2}-0\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{a}{2\\sqrt{3}} - \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{a}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{4} + \\frac{a^2}{12}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3a^2+a^2}{12}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4a^2}{12}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{3}}\n$$\nThus, the side length is $s = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.\n\nThe triangular lattice possesses a six-fold rotational symmetry ($C_6$) about any lattice point. The set of nearest-neighbor vectors also exhibits this symmetry. The Wigner–Seitz construction, being based on these vectors, must also preserve this symmetry. Therefore, the resulting hexagon must be regular: all six sides have the same length $s = a/\\sqrt{3}$, and all internal angles are equal to $120^\\circ$.\n\nNext, we compute the area $A$ of this regular hexagon. A regular hexagon with side length $s$ can be decomposed into $6$ equilateral triangles with side length $s$. The area of one such equilateral triangle is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2$.\nThe total area $A$ is:\n$$\nA = 6 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}s^2\n$$\nSubstituting $s = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}$:\n$$\nA = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\left(\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\frac{a^2}{3} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a^2\n$$\n\nFinally, we must justify why this area is equal to the area per lattice point. The Wigner–Seitz cell is a primitive cell of the Bravais lattice. A primitive cell is a minimum-volume (or area, in 2D) cell that, when translated by all lattice vectors, tiles all of space without overlap or gaps. By this definition, a primitive cell contains exactly one lattice point. The area per lattice point is therefore the area of any primitive cell.\nWe can verify this by calculating the area of the primitive cell defined by the parallelogram spanned by the primitive vectors $\\mathbf{a}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{a}_{2}$. This area is given by the magnitude of the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors:\n$$\nA_{\\text{primitive}} = \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} a & \\frac{a}{2} \\\\ 0 & \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\right| = \\left| a \\cdot \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0 \\cdot \\frac{a}{2} \\right| = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a^2\n$$\nThis area is identical to the area $A$ of the Wigner–Seitz cell we calculated. This confirms the validity of our calculation and demonstrates that the Wigner–Seitz cell is indeed a primitive cell for the triangular lattice.\n\nThe problem asks for the ordered pair $(A, s)$.\n$$\nA = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a^2\n$$\n$$\ns = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\nThe final result is $\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a^2, \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a^2, \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\n}\n$$", "id": "2870601"}, {"introduction": "Moving into three dimensions, we now consider the body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice, a structure of fundamental importance in materials science.

A BCT lattice with conventional cell side lengths $a$, $a$, and $c$ has lattice points at positions $\\mathbf{R}$ whose coordinates $(x,y,z)$ satisfy the condition that $x/a$, $y/a$, and $z/c$ are either all integers or all half-integers.

The faces of the WS cell are determined by the subset of these planes that are not made redundant by others. This means we must identify the shortest lattice vectors.\n\nLet us find the squared lengths $|\\mathbf{R}|^2$ of the shortest non-zero lattice vectors. A vector $\\mathbf{R}$ can be written as $(ia, ja, kc)$, where $(i,j,k)$ are either all integers (not all zero) or all half-integers.

For Family A, the faces exist if $d_A^2  2 d_C^2 - d_B^2$ is not the condition. More simply, the faces generated by Family A bisectors exist as long as $c^2  2a^2$, or $t^2  2$.\n\nTherefore, the combinatorial structure of the WS cell depends on $t$ as follows:\n-   If $t  \\sqrt{2}$, the WS cell is bounded by planes from all three families, resulting in $2 (\\text{A}) + 4 (\\text{B}) + 8 (\\text{C}) = 14$ faces.

The cell has 12 faces and is a tetragonally distorted rhombic dodecahedron.\n\nNow we match these structures to the BCC and FCC WS cells.\n1.  **BCC Lattice:** The WS cell of a BCC lattice is a regular truncated octahedron, which has 14 faces. This combinatorial type corresponds to the BCT case for $t  \\sqrt{2}$. The BCT lattice becomes a BCC lattice when its conventional cell is cubic, i.e., $c=a$, which means $t=c/a=1$.
