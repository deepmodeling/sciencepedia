Advance the total time: $t_{total} = t_{total} + \\Delta t_{curr}$.\n4.  **Post-Processing**: After the simulation completes, analyze the stored time series to find the peak heat flow $\\dot{q}_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ and the corresponding time $t_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ and temperature $T_{\\mathrm{peak}}$. The final transformed fraction $X_{\\mathrm{final}}$ is the last value in the stored $X$ series.\n5.  **Result Formatting**: Round the calculated values to the specified decimal places and format the output as required. The use of NumPy arrays can facilitate efficient storage and analysis.\n\nThis algorithm correctly implements the non-isothermal model by re-evaluating rates at each time step and ensures that segment boundaries are precisely met.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the non-isothermal precipitation hardening kinetics problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Universal gas constant in J/(mol*K)\n    R = 8.314\n    # Time step in s\n    DT = 0.10\n    # Shape factor for spherical precipitates (m=3)\n    C3 = 4.0 * np.pi / 3.0\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A (single linear heating)\n        {\n            'I0': 1.0e20,  # m^-3 s^-1\n            'Qn': 1.40e5,  # J/mol\n            'U0': 1.0e-7,  # m/s\n            'Qg': 1.20e5,  # J/mol\n            'dH': 3.0e4,   # J/kg\n            'T0': 400.0,   # K\n            'segments': [(3600.0, 0.1666667)]  # (duration_s, beta_K/s)\n        },\n        # Case B (ramp–hold–ramp)\n        {\n            'I0': 1.0e20,\n            'Qn': 1.50e5,\n            'U0': 5.0e-8,\n            'Qg': 1.25e5,\n            'dH': 3.0e4,\n            'T0': 390.0,\n            'segments': [(1800.0, 0.0333333), (600.0, 0.0), (1800.0, 0.0333333)]\n        },\n        # Case C (moderate heating, higher activation)\n        {\n            'I0': 5.0e21,\n            'Qn': 1.80e5,\n            'U0': 2.0e-7,\n            'Qg': 1.40e5,\n            'dH': 3.0e4,\n            'T0': 350.0,\n            'segments': [(4000.0, 0.1)]\n        }\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        # Unpack parameters\n        I0, Qn = case['I0'], case['Qn']\n        U0, Qg = case['U0'], case['Qg']\n        dH, T0 = case['dH'], case['T0']\n        segments = case['segments']\n\n        # Initialize state variables\n        t_current = 0.0\n        T_current = T0\n        # Moments M0, M1, M2, M3\n        M_k = np.zeros(4)\n\n        # Data storage\n        history_t = []\n        history_T = []\n        history_q_dot = []\n        history_X = []\n\n        # Simulation loop over segments\n        for duration, beta in segments:\n            t_segment_end = t_current + duration\n            \n            # Machine precision epsilon for float comparison\n            epsilon = 1e-9\n\n            while t_current < t_segment_end -
