It is self-contained, scientifically grounded in the principles of solid mechanics and energy conservation, and well-posed. The parameters provided are physically realistic and dimensionally consistent. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we shall proceed with its formal solution.\n\nThe derivation begins with the first principle of energy balance for a quasi-static crack growth process. The total potential energy, $\\Pi$, of an elastic body is the difference between its stored elastic strain energy, $U$, and the work, $W$, done on it by external forces:\n$$ \\Pi = U - W $$\nThe energy release rate, $G$, is defined as the negative rate of change of the total potential energy with respect to the crack area, $A$. For a through-thickness crack of total length $2a$ in a plate of unit thickness ($t=1$), the crack surface area is $A = 2a \\times t = 2a$. The derivative of the area with respect to the crack half-length $a$ is $\\frac{dA}{da} = 2$. Therefore, $G$ is given by:\n$$ G = -\\frac{d\\Pi}{dA} = -\\frac{d\\Pi}{da}\\frac{da}{dA} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d\\Pi}{da} $$\nThe problem specifies a constant remote tensile stress $\\sigma_{\\infty}$, which corresponds to a fixed-load condition. For a linearly elastic material under fixed load, the work done by the external forces is twice the stored strain energy, $W = 2U$. When the crack extends by an infinitesimal amount, causing a change in compliance, the incremental change in work done relates to the incremental change in strain energy as $dW = 2dU$. The corresponding change in potential energy is:\n$$ d\\Pi = dU - dW = dU - 2dU = -dU $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $G$ yields:\n$$ G = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{(-dU)}{da} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dU}{da} $$\nTo evaluate this, we must find the total strain energy $U$ as a function of the crack half-length $a$. Let $U_0$ be the strain energy of the uncracked plate. The introduction of a crack of length $2a$ increases the compliance of the plate, and thus increases the total stored strain energy. The total strain energy of the cracked plate is $U(a) = U_0 + \\Delta U(a)$, where $\\Delta U(a)$ is the additional strain energy due to the presence of the crack. Since $U_0$ is independent of $a$, its derivative is zero. Thus, we have:\n$$ G = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d}{da}\\left(U_0 + \\Delta U(a)\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d(\\Delta U)}{da} $$\nFrom the theory of elasticity for an infinite, isotropic plate under plane-stress conditions with a central through-crack of length $2a$, the increase in strain energy for a plate of unit thickness is given by:\n$$ \\Delta U(a) = \\frac{\\pi \\sigma_{\\infty}^2 a^2}{E} $$\nwhere $E$ is the Young's modulus. Differentiating this expression with respect to $a$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\Delta U)}{da} = \\frac{d}{da} \\left( \\frac{\\pi \\sigma_{\\infty}^2 a^2}{E} \\right) = \\frac{2\\pi \\sigma_{\\infty}^2 a}{E} $$\nSubstituting this result into the expression for $G$:\n$$ G = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\sigma_{\\infty}^2 a}{E} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi \\sigma_{\\infty}^2 a}{E} $$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the energy release rate for this configuration.\n\nNext, we apply the Griffith criterion for crack propagation, which states that the crack will grow when the energy release rate $G$ reaches a critical value, the material's fracture toughness, $G_c$. The critical stress, $\\sigma_c$, is the far-field stress at which this condition is met:\n$$ G = G_c \\implies \\frac{\\pi \\sigma_c^2 a}{E} = G_c $$\nSolving for the critical stress $\\sigma_c$ yields:\n$$ \\sigma_c^2 = \\frac{E G_c}{\\pi a} $$\n$$ \\sigma_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{E G_c}{\\pi a}} $$\nThis is the expression for the critical stress required for fracture.\n\nWe now evaluate these expressions numerically using the provided data.

The standard mandates that the specimen thickness, $B$, the crack length, $a$, and the uncracked ligament, $W-a$, must all exceed a minimum characteristic length.
