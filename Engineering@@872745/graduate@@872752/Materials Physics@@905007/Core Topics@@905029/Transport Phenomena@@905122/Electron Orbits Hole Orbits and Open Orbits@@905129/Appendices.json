The validation of the problem statement confirms its scientific soundness and well-posed nature.\n\nWe shall proceed by establishing the relationships between the given experimental parameters and the intrinsic properties of the charge carriers, namely their density, mobility, and sign of charge.\n\nFirst, we relate the SdH frequencies, $F_{i}$, to the carrier densities, $n_{i}$. The Onsager relation connects the frequency $F$ to the extremal cross-sectional area $A_{k}$ of the Fermi surface normal to the magnetic field:\n$$F = \\frac{\\hbar}{2\\pi e} A_{k}$$\nFor a two-dimensional system with spin degeneracy, the carrier density $n$ of a single Fermi pocket is given by the area in k-space enclosed by the Fermi contour, divided by $(2\\pi)^2$ and multiplied by the spin degeneracy factor of $2$:\n$$n = \\frac{2 A_{k}}{(2\\pi)^2} = \\frac{A_{k}}{2\\pi^2}$$\nCombining these two relations, we find a direct proportionality between the carrier density and the SdH frequency:\n$$n = \\frac{A_{k}}{2\\pi^2} = \\frac{e F}{\\pi \\hbar}$$\nTherefore, the ratio of the carrier densities of the two pockets is equal to the ratio of their SdH frequencies:\n$$\\frac{n_{1}}{n_{2}} = \\frac{F_{1}}{F_{2}} = \\frac{180\\,\\mathrm{T}}{220\\,\\mathrm{T}} = \\frac{9}{11}$$\nThis shows that the carrier density of pocket $2$ is greater than that of pocket $1$, i.e., $n_{2}  n_{1}$.\n\nNext, we determine the ratio of the carrier mobilities, $\\mu_{i}$. The mobility in the Drude model is given by $\\mu_{i} = e\\tau_{i}/m_{i}^{\\ast}$, where $\\tau_{i}$ is the scattering time and $m_{i}^{\\ast}$ is the cyclotron effective mass. The problem states that the scattering time is the same for both orbits, $\\tau_{1} = \\tau_{2} = \\tau$.

Their ratio is:\n$$\\frac{n_{1}\\mu_{1}^{2}}{n_{2}\\mu_{2}^{2}} = \\left(\\frac{n_{1}}{n_{2}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{1}}{\\mu_{2}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{9}{11}\\right)\\left(\\frac{10}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{11} \\cdot \\frac{100}{9} = \\frac{100}{11}$$\nSince $100/11  1$, we have $n_{1}\\mu_{1}^{2}  n_{2}\\mu_{2}^{2}$.\n\nLet us now test the two possible scenarios:\n\nScenario A: Pocket 1 is electron-like and pocket 2 is hole-like.\nIn this case, we identify $n_{e} = n_{1}$, $\\mu_{e} = \\mu_{1}$ and $n_{h} = n_{2}$, $\\mu_{h} = \\mu_{2}$.\nThe high-field condition is $n_{e}  n_{h}$, which translates to $n_{1}  n_{2}$. This contradicts our finding that $n_{2}  n_{1}$. Therefore, this scenario is incorrect.\n\nScenario B: Pocket 1 is hole-like and pocket 2 is electron-like.\nIn this case, we identify $n_{h} = n_{1}$, $\\mu_{h} = \\mu_{1}$ and $n_{e} = n_{2}$, $\\mu_{e} = \\mu_{2}$.\nLet's check the two conditions:\n1. High-field condition: $n_{e}  n_{h}$. This translates to $n_{2}  n_{1}$. Our analysis of SdH frequencies confirms this as correct ($220  180$).\n2. Low-field condition: $n_{h}\\mu_{h}^{2}  n_{e}\\mu_{e}^{2}$. This translates to $n_{1}\\mu_{1}^{2}  n_{2}\\mu_{2}^{2}$. Our calculation confirms this is correct (the ratio is $100/11  1$).\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied under this assignment. Thus, pocket $1$ must be hole-like and pocket $2$ must be electron-like. The small, high-mobility pocket ($1$) determines the sign of the low-field Hall effect, while the overall charge balance, dominated by the larger pocket ($2$), determines the sign of the high-field Hall effect.\n\nThe problem asks for the result as a row matrix $(s_{1}\\ s_{2})$, where $s_{i} = +1$ for electron-like and $s_{i} = -1$ for hole-like.\nBased on our conclusion:\n- Orbit 1 is hole-like, so $s_{1} = -1$.\n- Orbit 2 is electron-like, so $s_{2} = +1$.\n\nThe final classification is $(-1, +1)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -1  1 \\end{pmatrix}}$", "id": "2818390"}]}
