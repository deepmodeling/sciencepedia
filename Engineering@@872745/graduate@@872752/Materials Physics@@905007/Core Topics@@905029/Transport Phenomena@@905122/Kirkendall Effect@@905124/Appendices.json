It is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, we must establish the relationship between fluxes in the laboratory frame and the lattice frame. Second, we must derive an explicit expression for the lattice velocity, known as the Kirkendall velocity.\n\nFor the first part, we consider the flux of species $A$. The laboratory-frame flux, $\\tilde J_A$, is the total rate at which atoms of species $A$ cross a fixed plane in the laboratory. This total flux is composed of two contributions: $1$) the flux of $A$ relative to the moving lattice, which is the intrinsic flux $J_A^*$, and $2$) the convective flux of $A$ atoms being carried along with the moving lattice itself.\n\nThe local concentration of species $A$ is $c_A(x,t) = c_t N_A(x,t)$, where $c_t$ is the constant total lattice-site concentration and $N_A$ is the site fraction of $A$. The lattice itself moves with a local velocity $v(x,t)$. The convective flux is therefore the concentration of species $A$ multiplied by this velocity, which is $c_A v$.\n\nBy definition, the flux in the fixed laboratory frame is the sum of the flux relative to the moving frame (the lattice) and the convective flux due to the motion of that frame. Thus, we have:\n$$ \\tilde J_A = J_A^* + c_A v $$\nSubstituting $c_A = c_t N_A$, we arrive at the relationship for species $A$:\n$$ \\tilde J_A = J_A^* + c_t N_A v $$\nAn analogous relation holds for species $B$:\n$$ \\tilde J_B = J_B^* + c_t N_B v $$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we must find an expression for the lattice velocity $v$. The problem states that we must use the principle of conservation of lattice sites for a substitutional alloy with constant total site concentration $c_t$. This physical constraint implies that there is no net creation or destruction of lattice sites. In the laboratory frame, this means there is no net volume flow, or equivalently, no net atomic flux across any plane. This is expressed as the condition that the sum of the total laboratory-frame fluxes of all species is zero. For a binary alloy, this condition is:\n$$ \\tilde J_A + \\tilde J_B = 0 $$\nWe substitute the expressions for $\\tilde J_A$ and $\\tilde J_B$ derived above into this conservation equation:\n$$ (J_A^* + c_t N_A v) + (J_B^* + c_t N_B v) = 0 $$\nWe can group terms to solve for the velocity $v$:\n$$ J_A^* + J_B^* + v (c_t N_A + c_t N_B) = 0 $$\nUsing the fact that the total concentration of sites is $c_t = c_A + c_B = c_t N_A + c_t N_B$, which is also $c_t(N_A + N_B)$, and since $N_A + N_B = 1$, the term in parentheses simplifies to $c_t$.\n$$ J_A^* + J_B^* + v c_t = 0 $$\nSolving for $v$ yields:\n$$ v = - \\frac{J_A^* + J_B^*}{c_t} $$\nNow, we must introduce the Fickian constitutive laws for the intrinsic fluxes. The intrinsic flux of species $i$ relative to the lattice is given by Fick's first law: $J_i^* = -D_i \\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial x}$. Since the total site concentration $c_t$ is constant, we can write $c_A = c_t N_A$ and $c_B = c_t N_B$. The derivatives are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c_A}{\\partial x} = c_t \\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial c_B}{\\partial x} = c_t \\frac{\\partial N_B}{\\partial x} $$\nThus, the intrinsic fluxes are:\n$$ J_A^* = -D_A c_t \\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x} $$\n$$ J_B^* = -D_B c_t \\frac{\\partial N_B}{\\partial x} $$\nFrom the constraint that site fractions sum to unity, $N_A + N_B = 1$, it follows that their spatial gradients must sum to zero:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial N_B}{\\partial x} = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial N_B}{\\partial x} = - \\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $J_B^*$:\n$$ J_B^* = -D_B c_t \\left( - \\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x} \\right) = D_B c_t \\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x} $$\nWe now substitute the expressions for $J_A^*$ and $J_B^*$ in terms of the gradient of $N_A$ into our equation for $v$:\n$$ v = - \\frac{1}{c_t} \\left( -D_A c_t \\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x} + D_B c_t \\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x} \\right) $$\nThe constant $c_t$ cancels out from the numerator and denominator:\n$$ v = - \\left( -D_A \\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x} + D_B \\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x} \\right) $$\nFactoring out the common term $\\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x}$:\n$$ v = - (D_B - D_A) \\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x} $$\nFinally, distributing the negative sign, we obtain the expression for the Kirkendall marker velocity:\n$$ v = (D_A - D_B) \\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x} $$\nThis result shows that a non-zero lattice velocity, and thus the Kirkendall effect, arises from a difference in the intrinsic diffusivities of the two species ($D_A \\neq D_B$) in the presence of a composition gradient ($\\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x} \\neq 0$).

This simplifies the expression to:\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{Si}}^* + J_{\\mathrm{Fe}}^* + C v_{\\mathrm{K}} = 0 $$\nSolving for the Kirkendall velocity $v_{\\mathrm{K}}$:\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{K}} = -\\frac{1}{C} (J_{\\mathrm{Si}}^* + J_{\\mathrm{Fe}}^*) $$\nThe intrinsic fluxes are given by Fick's first law in the lattice frame: $J_{\\mathrm{Si}}^{*} = -D_{\\mathrm{Si}} C (\\partial N_{\\mathrm{Si}}/\\partial x)$ and $J_{\\mathrm{Fe}}^{*} = -D_{\\mathrm{Fe}} C (\\partial N_{\\mathrm{Fe}}/\\partial x)$.

Uncertainty Propagation for $D_{\\mathrm{Si}}$**\n\nThe standard uncertainty in $D_{\\mathrm{Si}}$, denoted $u(D_{\\mathrm{Si}})$ or $\\sigma_{D_{\\mathrm{Si}}}$, is found using first-order Taylor expansion (linear error propagation). Assuming the input measured quantities ($\\tilde D$, $N$, $v_{\\mathrm{K}}$, $g$) are uncorrelated, the variance of $D_{\\mathrm{Si}}$ is the sum of the squared partial derivatives weighted by the variances of the inputs:\n$$ \\sigma_{D_{\\mathrm{Si}}}^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial D_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{\\partial \\tilde D}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{\\tilde D}^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial D_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{\\partial N}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{N}^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial D_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{\\partial v_{\\mathrm{K}}}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{v_{\\mathrm{K}}}^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial D_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{\\partial g}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{g}^2 $$\nThe required partial derivatives are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial D_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{\\partial \\tilde D} = 1 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial D_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{\\partial N} = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{K}}}{g} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial D_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{\\partial v_{\\mathrm{K}}} = \\frac{N}{g} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial D_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{\\partial g} = -N \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{K}}}{g^2} $$\nThe marker velocity $v_{\\mathrm{K}}$ is approximated by $v_{\\mathrm{K}} \\approx (x_1 - x_0) / (t_1 - t_0)$. Since times $t_0$ and $t_1$ are exact and positions $x_0$ and $x_1$ are independent random variables with uncertainties $\\sigma_{x0}$ and $\\sigma_{x1}$, the variance of $v_{\\mathrm{K}}$ is:\n$$ \\sigma_{v_{\\mathrm{K}}}^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_{x_0}^2 + \\sigma_{x_1}^2}{(t_1 - t_0)^2} $$\nSubstituting these into the variance formula for $D_{\\mathrm{Si}}$ gives:\n$$ \\sigma_{D_{\\mathrm{Si}}}^2 = \\sigma_{\\tilde D}^2 + \\left(\\frac{v_{\\mathrm{K}}}{g}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{N}^2 + \\left(\\frac{N}{g}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{x_0}^2 + \\sigma_{x_1}^2}{(t_1-t_0)^2}\\right) + \\left(-N \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{K}}}{g^2}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{g}^2 $$\nThe standard uncertainty is the square root of this variance, $u(D_{\\mathrm{Si}}) = \\sqrt{\\sigma_{D_{\\mathrm{Si}}}^2}$.\n\nThese derived formulae are implemented in the following program to process the provided test cases. All units are converted to the SI base system ($\\mathrm{m}$, $\\mathrm{s}$) before computation.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the intrinsic diffusivity of Silicon and its uncertainty \n    based on the Darken analysis of Kirkendall effect measurements.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Test cases:\n    # (t0_h, t1_h, x0_um, x1_um, sig_x0_um, sig_x1_um, N_Si, sig_N, g_m, sig_g_m, D_tilde, sig_D_tilde)\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1\n        (0.0, 10.0, 0.0, 14.4, 0.2, 0.2, 0.30, 0.01, 1.00e5, 1.50e4, 3.00e-14, 0.30e-14),\n        # Case 2\n        (0.0, 20.0, -2.0, 19.6, 0.3, 0.3, 0.15, 0.005, 1.20e5, 1.20e4, 1.60e-14, 0.16e-14),\n        # Case 3\n        (0.0, 10.0, 0.5, 2.3, 0.5, 0.5, 0.50, 0.02, 1.00e4, 5.00e3, 2.50e-15, 0.50e-15),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        t0_h, t1_h, x0_um, x1_um, sig_x0_um, sig_x1_um, N, sig_N, g, sig_g, D_tilde, sig_D_tilde = case\n        \n        # --- Unit Conversions to SI base units ---\n        # Time from hours to seconds\n        t0_s = t0_h * 3600.0\n        t1_s = t1_h * 3600.0\n        \n        # Position from micrometers to meters\n        x0_m = x0_um * 1e-6\n        x1_m = x1_um * 1e-6\n        sig_x0_m = sig_x0_um * 1e-6\n        sig_x1_m = sig_x1_um * 1e-6\n        \n        # Other quantities are already in SI units\n        \n        # --- Calculations for point estimates ---\n        \n        # Kirkendall marker velocity (v_K)\n        delta_t_s = t1_s - t0_s\n        delta_x_m = x1_m - x0_m\n        v_K = delta_x_m / delta_t_s\n        \n        # Intrinsic diffusivity of Silicon (D_Si)\n        # D_Si = D_tilde + N * v_K / g\n        D_Si = D_tilde + N * v_K / g\n        \n        # --- Calculations for uncertainty propagation ---\n        \n        # Variance of Kirkendall velocity (v_K)\n        var_v_K = (sig_x0_m**2 + sig_x1_m**2) / (delta_t_s**2)\n        \n        # Variance of D_Si\n        # d(D_Si)/d(D_tilde) = 1\n        # d(D_Si)/d(N) = v_K / g\n        # d(D_Si)/d(v_K) = N / g\n        # d(D_Si)/d(g) = -N * v_K / g^2\n        \n        # Individual variance components\n        var_from_D_tilde = sig_D_tilde**2\n        var_from_N = (v_K / g)**2 * sig_N**2\n        var_from_v_K = (N / g)**2 * var_v_K\n        var_from_g = (-N * v_K / g**2)**2 * sig_g**2\n        \n        # Total variance of D_Si\n        var_D_Si = var_from_D_tilde + var_from_N + var_from_v_K + var_from_g\n        \n        # Standard uncertainty of D_Si\n        u_D_Si = np.sqrt(var_D_Si)\n        \n        results.extend([D_Si, u_D_Si])\n\n    # Format output as specified\n    formatted_results = [f\"{val:.6e}\" for val in results]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2832812"}]}
