Required discussion: the significance of this field for intrinsic coercivity.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes the classic Stoner-Wohlfarth model for coherent magnetization rotation under a transverse field. The theoretical framework is sound, and the provided parameters are physically realistic for hard magnetic materials. The problem contains no contradictions or ambiguities. It is a standard, valid problem in magnetism. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe total energy density of the single-domain ferromagnet is the sum of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy and the Zeeman energy:\n$$E(\\theta) = K_{1}\\sin^{2}\\theta - \\mu_{0}M_{s}H\\sin\\theta$$\nwhere the field is applied at an angle $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ to the easy axis.\n\nThe equilibrium orientation of the magnetization is found by minimizing the total energy density with respect to the angle $\\theta$. This requires the first derivative of the energy to be zero:\n$$\\frac{dE}{d\\theta} = \\frac{d}{d\\theta}(K_{1}\\sin^{2}\\theta - \\mu_{0}M_{s}H\\sin\\theta) = 0$$\n$$2K_{1}\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta - \\mu_{0}M_{s}H\\cos\\theta = 0$$\nFactoring yields:\n$$\\cos\\theta (2K_{1}\\sin\\theta - \\mu_{0}M_{s}H) = 0$$\nThis equation provides two possible conditions for equilibrium.\n\nFor an equilibrium to be stable, it must correspond to a local minimum of the energy function. This requires the second derivative of the energy to be positive:\n$$\\frac{d^{2}E}{d\\theta^{2}} > 0$$\nWe compute the second derivative:\n$$\\frac{d^{2}E}{d\\theta^{2}} = \\frac{d}{d\\theta}(2K_{1}\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta - \\mu_{0}M_{s}H\\cos\\theta)$$\n$$\\frac{d^{2}E}{d\\theta^{2}} = 2K_{1}(\\cos^{2}\\theta - \\sin^{2}\\theta) + \\mu_{0}M_{s}H\\sin\\theta$$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\cos^{2}\\theta - \\sin^{2}\\theta = 1 - 2\\sin^{2}\\theta$, we obtain:\n$$\\frac{d^{2}E}{d\\theta^{2}} = 2K_{1}(1 - 2\\sin^{2}\\theta) + \\mu_{0}M_{s}H\\sin\\theta$$\n\nThe problem asks for the critical field at which the easy-axis minimum loses stability. In the absence of a field ($H=0$), the easy-axis minima are at $\\theta=0$ and $\\theta=\\pi$. As the transverse field $H$ increases from zero, the magnetization rotates away from the easy axis. The relevant equilibrium condition is the second one:\n$$2K_{1}\\sin\\theta - \\mu_{0}M_{s}H = 0 \\implies \\sin\\theta = \\frac{\\mu_{0}M_{s}H}{2K_{1}}$$\nThis solution describes the rotation of the magnetization towards the field direction. It is physically valid for $|\\sin\\theta| \\leq 1$, which implies $H \\leq \\frac{2K_{1}}{\\mu_{0}M_{s}}$.\n\nTo check the stability of this equilibrium state, we substitute $\\sin\\theta = \\frac{\\mu_{0}M_{s}H}{2K_{1}}$ into the expression for the second derivative:\n$$\\frac{d^{2}E}{d\\theta^{2}} = 2K_{1} - 4K_{1}\\sin^{2}\\theta + \\mu_{0}M_{s}H\\sin\\theta$$\n$$\\frac{d^{2}E}{d\\theta^{2}} = 2K_{1} - 4K_{1}\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{0}M_{s}H}{2K_{1}}\\right)^{2} + \\mu_{0}M_{s}H\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{0}M_{s}H}{2K_{1}}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{d^{2}E}{d\\theta^{2}} = 2K_{1} - \\frac{(\\mu_{0}M_{s}H)^{2}}{K_{1}} + \\frac{(\\mu_{0}M_{s}H)^{2}}{2K_{1}}$$\n$$\\frac{d^{2}E}{d\\theta^{2}} = 2K_{1} - \\frac{(\\mu_{0}M_{s}H)^{2}}{2K_{1}}$$\nThe stability condition $\\frac{d^{2}E}{d\\theta^{2}} > 0$ requires:\n$$2K_{1} - \\frac{(\\mu_{0}M_{s}H)^{2}}{2K_{1}} > 0 \\implies 4K_{1}^{2} > (\\mu_{0}M_{s}H)^{2}$$\nSince all parameters are positive, this simplifies to:\n$$\\mu_{0}M_{s}H < 2K_{1} \\implies H < \\frac{2K_{1}}{\\mu_{0}M_{s}}$$\nThe stability of the minimum is lost when this inequality becomes an equality. This defines the critical field, known as the anisotropy field, $H_{K}$.\n$$H_{K} = \\frac{2K_{1}}{\\mu_{0}M_{s}}$$\nThe problem requests an expression for $\\mu_{0}H_{K}$. Multiplying by $\\mu_{0}$ is trivial.\n$$\\mu_{0}H_{K} = \\frac{2K_{1}}{M_{s}}$$\nAt this field, $H=H_{K}$, we have $\\sin\\theta = \\frac{\\mu_{0}M_{s}}{2K_{1}} \\left(\\frac{2K_{1}}{\\mu_{0}M_{s}}\\right) = 1$, so $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The magnetization has fully aligned with the hard axis, and the energy minimum has become a point of inflection, as $\\frac{d^{2}E}{d\\theta^{2}}=0$.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $\\mu_{0}H_{K}$ for the given material parameters: $K_{1} = 4\\,\\mathrm{MJ/m^{3}} = 4 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{J/m^{3}}$ and $M_{s} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{MA/m} = 1.2 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{A/m}$.\n$$\\mu_{0}H_{K} = \\frac{2 \\times (4 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{J/m^{3}})}{1.2 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{A/m}} = \\frac{8}{1.2} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{J/m^{3}}}{\\mathrm{A/m}}$$\nThe units are $\\frac{\\mathrm{J}}{\\mathrm{A} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{4}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{N} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{A} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{4}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{N}}{\\mathrm{A} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{3}}$. This is incorrect. Re-evaluating the definition of $H_K$: $H_K=2K_1/(\\mu_0 M_s)$, thus $\\mu_0 H_K = 2K_1/M_s$. The units of $K_1$ are energy per volume, $\\mathrm{J/m^3}$. The units of $M_s$ are magnetic moment per volume, $\\mathrm{A \\cdot m^2 / m^3} = \\mathrm{A/m}$. Therefore, the units of $2K_1/M_s$ are $\\frac{\\mathrm{J/m^3}}{\\mathrm{A/m}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{J}}{\\mathrm{A \\cdot m^2}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{N \\cdot m}}{\\mathrm{A \\cdot m^2}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{N}}{\\mathrm{A \\cdot m}}$, which is the Tesla ($\\mathrm{T}$), the unit of magnetic flux density. The unit analysis is correct.\n$$\\mu_{0}H_{K} = \\frac{8}{1.2}\\,\\mathrm{T} = \\frac{80}{12}\\,\\mathrm{T} = \\frac{20}{3}\\,\\mathrm{T} \\approx 6.6666...\\,\\mathrm{T}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $6.667\\,\\mathrm{T}$.\n\nFinally, the significance of the anisotropy field must be discussed. The quantity $H_{K}$ represents the field required to saturate the magnetization along the hard axis. Crucially, it also sets the theoretical upper limit for the intrinsic coercivity, $H_{ci}$, within the framework of coherent rotation (the Stoner-Wohlfarth model). If a reversing field is applied antiparallel to the initial easy-axis magnetization, the energy barrier that prevents magnetization reversal vanishes precisely at a field strength of $H_{K}$. At this point, the magnetization becomes unstable and irreversibly switches its direction, defining the coercivity. Thus, for coherent rotation, $H_{ci} = H_{K} = \\frac{2K_{1}}{\\mu_{0}M_{s}}$. This is why high anisotropy ($K_{1}$) is a prerequisite for a high-coercivity hard magnetic material.\n\nIn practice, the coercivity of real materials is almost always lower than this theoretical maximum. This discrepancy, known as Brown's paradox, arises because coherent rotation is an energetically unfavorable reversal mechanism. Real materials contain imperfections, grain boundaries, and are not perfect single domains. Magnetization reversal typically initiates at a lower field via one of two primary mechanisms:\n1.  **Incoherent Rotation Modes:** Non-uniform reversal modes, such as curling or buckling, can occur in particles of sufficient size and require less energy, thus being triggered by smaller applied fields.\n2.  **Nucleation of Reverse Domains:** In bulk or polycrystalline materials, reversal proceeds by the nucleation of a small domain with reversed magnetization, followed by the motion of the domain wall across the grain. The field required to nucleate such a reverse domain or to unpin a domain wall from a defect is typically much smaller than $H_{K}$.\n\nTherefore, the anisotropy field $H_K$ is a fundamental material parameter that provides an ideal upper bound for coercivity, a target that can only be approached in high-quality, nanoscale, single-domain particles where incoherent modes and domain wall effects are suppressed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\pmatrix{ \\frac{2K_{1}}{M_{s}} & 6.667 \\text{ T} }}$$", "id": "2827378"}, {"introduction": "Beyond high coercivity, the practical utility of a permanent magnet is quantified by its maximum energy product, $(BH)_{max}$, which measures the maximum energy density it can supply to its surroundings.
