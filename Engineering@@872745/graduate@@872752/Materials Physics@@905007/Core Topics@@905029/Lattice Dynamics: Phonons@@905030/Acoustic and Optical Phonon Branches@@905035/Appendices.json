A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe force on the $n$-th atom, $F_n$, is the sum of the forces exerted by its two nearest neighbors, the $(n-1)$-th and $(n+1)$-th atoms. Using the harmonic approximation (Hooke's law), the force exerted by the $(n+1)$-th atom on the $n$-th atom is $F_{n+1, n} = K(u_{n+1} - u_n)$. The force exerted by the $(n-1)$-th atom on the $n$-th atom is $F_{n-1, n} = K(u_{n-1} - u_n)$. The total force on the $n$-th atom is the sum of these two forces:\n$$\nF_n = F_{n+1, n} + F_{n-1, n} = K(u_{n+1} - u_n) + K(u_{n-1} - u_n) = K(u_{n+1} + u_{n-1} - 2u_n)\n$$\nAccording to Newton's second law, $F_n = m \\ddot{u}_n$, where $\\ddot{u}_n$ is the acceleration of the $n$-th atom. The linearized equation of motion for the $n$-th atom is therefore:\n$$\nm \\frac{d^2 u_n}{dt^2} = K(u_{n+1} + u_{n-1} - 2u_n)\n$$\nTo solve this set of coupled differential equations, we seek a plane-wave solution of the form dictated by the crystal's discrete translational symmetry (Bloch's theorem). The displacement of the $n$-th atom, located at equilibrium position $x_n = na$, is given by:\n$$\nu_n(t) = A \\exp[i(q x_n - \\omega t)] = A \\exp[i(qna - \\omega t)]\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the amplitude, $q$ is the wavevector, and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. The displacements of the nearest neighbors are:\n$$\nu_{n+1}(t) = A \\exp[i(q(n+1)a - \\omega t)] = u_n(t) \\exp(iqa)\n$$\n$$\nu_{n-1}(t) = A \\exp[i(q(n-1)a - \\omega t)] = u_n(t) \\exp(-iqa)\n$$\nThe second time derivative of $u_n(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 u_n}{dt^2} = (-i\\omega)^2 u_n(t) = -\\omega^2 u_n(t)\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation of motion:\n$$\nm(-\\omega^2 u_n) = K(u_n \\exp(iqa) + u_n \\exp(-iqa) - 2u_n)\n$$\nSince $u_n$ is not trivially zero, we can divide both sides by it:\n$$\n-m\\omega^2 = K(\\exp(iqa) + \\exp(-iqa) - 2)\n$$\nUsing Euler's identity, $\\exp(i\\theta) + \\exp(-i\\theta) = 2\\cos(\\theta)$, we get:\n$$\n-m\\omega^2 = K(2\\cos(qa) - 2) = -2K(1 - \\cos(qa))\n$$\nApplying the half-angle trigonometric identity $1 - \\cos(\\theta) = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$:\n$$\nm\\omega^2 = 2K \\left( 2\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{qa}{2}\\right) \\right) = 4K\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{qa}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThis yields the dispersion relation for the angular frequency $\\omega$ as a function of the wavevector $q$:\n$$\n\\omega(q) = \\sqrt{\\frac{4K}{m}} \\left| \\sin\\left(\\frac{qa}{2}\\right) \\right| = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{m}} \\left| \\sin\\left(\\frac{qa}{2}\\right) \\right|\n$$\nThis relation describes the acoustic phonon branch.
