Therefore, the problem is valid and we shall proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe first task is to derive the relationship between the electron number density, $n$, and the Fermi wavevector, $k_F$. We begin by considering a system of free electrons confined to a cubic volume $V = L^3$ with periodic boundary conditions imposed.\n\nA single-particle wavefunction for a free electron is a plane wave, given by $\\psi_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{r}) = A \\exp(i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r})$, where $\\mathbf{k}$ is the wavevector. The periodic boundary conditions require that the wavefunction is periodic with period $L$ along each of the three Cartesian axes. For the $x$-direction, this condition is $\\psi(x+L, y, z) = \\psi(x, y, z)$. This leads to the requirement $\\exp(i k_x (x+L)) = \\exp(i k_x x)$, which simplifies to $\\exp(i k_x L) = 1$. The solutions to this equation are $k_x L = 2\\pi m_x$, where $m_x$ is an integer.

These allowed wavevectors form a discrete grid in $\\mathbf{k}$-space. The separation between adjacent points on this grid along any Cartesian axis is $\\Delta k = \\frac{2\\pi}{L}$. The volume in $\\mathbf{k}$-space occupied by a single allowed electronic state (a single point on the grid) is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta V_k = (\\Delta k_x)(\\Delta k_y)(\\Delta k_z) = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^3 = \\frac{8\\pi^3}{L^3} = \\frac{8\\pi^3}{V}\n$$\nIn the ground state of the free-electron gas at absolute zero temperature ($T=0$), the electrons occupy all available single-particle states up to a maximum energy, the Fermi energy $E_F$.
