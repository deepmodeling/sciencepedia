We must construct primitive translation vectors for each lattice, justify their completeness, calculate the primitive cell volumes, and finally compute the ratio of these volumes.\n\nFirst, we address the body-centered cubic (bcc) lattice. The conventional cell is a cube of side length $a$. The bcc lattice points are located at the corners of this cube and at its body center. If we place the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system at one corner, the lattice points within the conventional cell are at $(0,0,0)$ and $a(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})$. All other lattice points are translations of these two points by vectors $n_x a \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + n_y a \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + n_z a \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, where $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$ are integers.\n\nA valid set of primitive translation vectors for the bcc lattice, constructed relative to the origin at a lattice point, is:\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_1 = \\frac{a}{2}(-\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) $$\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_2 = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) $$\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_3 = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) $$\nThese vectors are linearly independent, which is readily verifiable. To justify that these vectors generate all and only the bcc lattice points, consider an arbitrary lattice vector $\\mathbf{R}$ formed by an integer linear combination $\\mathbf{R} = n_1 \\mathbf{a}_1 + n_2 \\mathbf{a}_2 + n_3 \\mathbf{a}_3$, where $n_1, n_2, n_3 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. In Cartesian components, this is:\n$$ \\mathbf{R} = \\frac{a}{2}[(-n_1+n_2+n_3)\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + (n_1-n_2+n_3)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + (n_1+n_2-n_3)\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}] $$\nLet the integer coefficients of the unit vectors (in units of $a/2$) be $N_x = -n_1+n_2+n_3$, $N_y = n_1-n_2+n_3$, and $N_z = n_1+n_2-n_3$. The sum of any two of these coefficients is an even number, for instance $N_x+N_y = 2n_3$. This implies that $N_x, N_y, N_z$ must all have the same parity.\nCase 1: $N_x, N_y, N_z$ are all even. Let $N_x=2k_x, N_y=2k_y, N_z=2k_z$ for some integers $k_x,k_y,k_z$. The position vector is $\\mathbf{R} = a(k_x\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + k_y\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + k_z\\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$. These are the corner points of the conventional cubic lattice.\nCase 2: $N_x, N_y, N_z$ are all odd. Let $N_x=2k_x+1, N_y=2k_y+1, N_z=2k_z+1$. The position vector is $\\mathbf{R} = \\frac{a}{2}((2k_x+1)\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + (2k_y+1)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + (2k_z+1)\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = a(k_x\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + k_y\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + k_z\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) + \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$. These are the body-center points.\nSince any integer combination of the primitive vectors leads to one of these two cases, the vectors generate only bcc lattice points. Conversely, any bcc lattice point can be described by a set of coefficients $(N_x, N_y, N_z)$ with the same parity, for which integer solutions for $n_1, n_2, n_3$ exist: $n_1 = \\frac{1}{2}(N_y+N_z)$, $n_2 = \\frac{1}{2}(N_x+N_z)$, $n_3 = \\frac{1}{2}(N_x+N_y)$. These are integers because $N_i$ have the same parity. Thus, the vectors generate all bcc lattice points.\n\nThe volume of the primitive cell, $V_{\\mathrm{bcc,prim}}$, is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of the primitive vectors:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{bcc,prim}} = |\\mathbf{a}_1 \\cdot (\\mathbf{a}_2 \\times \\mathbf{a}_3)| = \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -a/2  a/2  a/2 \\\\ a/2  -a/2  a/2 \\\\ a/2  a/2  -a/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right| $$\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{bcc,prim}} = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^3 \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1  1  1 \\\\ 1  -1  1 \\\\ 1  1  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right| = \\frac{a^3}{8} |-1(1-1) - 1(-1-1) + 1(1 - (-1))| = \\frac{a^3}{8} |0+2+2| = \\frac{4a^3}{8} = \\frac{a^3}{2} $$\nTo reconcile this with a direct counting argument: the conventional bcc cell contains $8 \\times (1/8) = 1$ corner atom plus $1$ body-center atom, for a total of $N_{\\mathrm{bcc}} = 2$ lattice points. The volume of the conventional cell is $V_{\\mathrm{conv}} = a^3$. The volume per lattice point is $V_{\\mathrm{conv}}/N_{\\mathrm{bcc}} = a^3/2$. This matches our calculated $V_{\\mathrm{bcc,prim}}$, confirming that the primitive cell by definition contains exactly one lattice point.\n\nNext, we address the face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice. The lattice points are at the corners of the conventional cube and at the center of each of its $6$ faces.\nA valid set of primitive translation vectors for the fcc lattice, constructed from the origin at a lattice point, is:\n$$ \\mathbf{b}_1 = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) $$\n$$ \\mathbf{b}_2 = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) $$\n$$ \\mathbf{b}_3 = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) $$\nThese vectors are also linearly independent. An arbitrary lattice vector is $\\mathbf{R} = m_1 \\mathbf{b}_1 + m_2 \\mathbf{b}_2 + m_3 \\mathbf{b}_3$, where $m_1, m_2, m_3 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. In Cartesian components:\n$$ \\mathbf{R} = \\frac{a}{2}[(m_2+m_3)\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + (m_1+m_3)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + (m_1+m_2)\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}] $$\nLet the integer coefficients of the unit vectors (in units of $a/2$) be $N_x = m_2+m_3$, $N_y = m_1+m_3$, and $N_z = m_1+m_2$. The sum of these coefficients is $N_x+N_y+N_z = 2(m_1+m_2+m_3)$, which is always an even integer. This condition, that a point with coordinates $(x,y,z)$ corresponds to an fcc lattice point if and only if $x/(a/2), y/(a/2), z/(a/2)$ are integers whose sum is even, correctly defines the fcc lattice. Thus, these vectors generate all and only fcc points. The converse holds as any fcc point with coordinates $(x,y,z)$ corresponds to integer or half-integer coefficients $(x/a, y/a, z/a)$ whose sum is an integer. This is equivalent to our condition, and integer solutions for $m_1, m_2, m_3$ can be found: $m_1 = \\frac{1}{2}(-N_x+N_y+N_z)$, etc., which are guaranteed to be integers.\n\nThe volume of the fcc primitive cell, $V_{\\mathrm{fcc,prim}}$, is:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{fcc,prim}} = |\\mathbf{b}_1 \\cdot (\\mathbf{b}_2 \\times \\mathbf{b}_3)| = \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0  a/2  a/2 \\\\ a/2  0  a/2 \\\\ a/2  a/2  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right| $$\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{fcc,prim}} = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^3 \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  1 \\\\ 1  0  1 \\\\ 1  1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right| = \\frac{a^3}{8} |0(0-1) - 1(0-1) + 1(1-0)| = \\frac{a^3}{8} |0+1+1| = \\frac{2a^3}{8} = \\frac{a^3}{4} $$\nThe direct counting argument for the conventional fcc cell yields $8 \\times (1/8) = 1$ corner atom plus $6 \\times (1/2) = 3$ face-center atoms, for a total of $N_{\\mathrm{fcc}} = 4$ lattice points. The volume per lattice point is $V_{\\mathrm{conv}}/N_{\\mathrm{fcc}} = a^3/4$. This again matches $V_{\\mathrm{fcc,prim}}$, providing the required reconciliation.\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R = V_{\\mathrm{bcc,prim}}/V_{\\mathrm{fcc,prim}}$:\n$$ R = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{bcc,prim}}}{V_{\\mathrm{fcc,prim}}} = \\frac{a^3/2}{a^3/4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{1} = 2 $$\nThe ratio is a dimensionless rational number, as required. It represents the fact that the packing of lattice points in a conventional bcc cell is half as dense as in an fcc cell.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2811711"}, {"introduction": "The choice of a primitive cell is not unique, but one choice stands out due to its unique geometric definition: the Wigner-Seitz cell, which contains all points in space closer to one lattice point than to any other. This cell is central to many concepts in solid-state physics, most notably as the basis for the first Brillouin zone in reciprocal space. This exercise challenges you to construct the Wigner-Seitz cell for both a simple cubic and a body-centered cubic lattice from first principles, using the method of perpendicular bisector planes [@problem_id:2811738]. Through this geometric construction, you will gain a powerful visual intuition for why this fundamental cell's shape can differ significantly from the conventional unit cell.", "problem": "Consider a Bravais lattice in three dimensions and the definition of the Wigner–Seitz cell: the Wigner–Seitz cell around a lattice point is the set of all points in space that are closer to that lattice point than to any other lattice point, equivalently the intersection of the half-spaces bounded by the perpendicular bisector planes of the vectors connecting the lattice point to each of its neighbors.

Then determine, by geometric reasoning based on which neighbor shells contribute bounding planes, whether the Wigner–Seitz cell coincides in shape with the conventional cubic cell for each lattice. Your reasoning should explicitly identify which neighbor vectors generate bounding planes, how many faces the Wigner–Seitz cell has, and how its volume compares to the conventional cubic cell.\n\nWhich option correctly captures the construction and conclusion for both lattices?\n\nA. For the simple cubic lattice, the six perpendicular bisector planes to the vectors $\\pm a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, $\\pm a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, $\\pm a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ are $x=\\pm a/2$, $y=\\pm a/2$, $z=\\pm a/2$, which alone bound the Wigner–Seitz cell; planes to more distant neighbors lie outside or intersect only along edges and do not add faces. Hence the Wigner–Seitz cell is a cube of side $a$ (equal in shape to the conventional cell, up to translation). For the body-centered cubic lattice, the eight nearest neighbors at $\\mathbf{R}=(a/2)(\\pm1,\\pm1,\\pm1)$ generate planes $x\\pm y\\pm z=\\pm 3a/4$ that truncate the corners, and the six next-nearest neighbors along $\\pm a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, $\\pm a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, $\\pm a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ generate the square faces $x=\\pm a/2$, $y=\\pm a/2$, $z=\\pm a/2$, producing a $14$-faced truncated octahedron of volume $a^{3}/2$, which does not coincide with the conventional cube.\n\nB. For the simple cubic lattice, the twelve face-diagonal neighbors generate additional bounding planes that cut off the cube’s corners, so the Wigner–Seitz cell is a truncated octahedron, whereas for the body-centered cubic lattice the Wigner–Seitz cell is the conventional cube because the eight body-diagonal neighbors are equidistant by symmetry.\n\nC. For both simple cubic and body-centered cubic lattices, the Wigner–Seitz cells coincide with their conventional cubic cells because each conventional cell is centered on a lattice point and thus consists of points closer to that point than to any other.\n\nD. For the simple cubic lattice, the Wigner–Seitz cell is the conventional cube. For the body-centered cubic lattice, the Wigner–Seitz cell becomes identical to the conventional cube after a translation by $(a/2,a/2,a/2)$ because both are Bravais lattices and translations preserve nearest-neighbor bisectors.\n\nE.

The definitions for the lattices and the Wigner-Seitz cell are correct and standard. The problem is well-posed, with sufficient information to derive a unique solution for the geometry of the Wigner-Seitz cells. The language is objective and precise. No flaws related to scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, ambiguity, or being ill-posed are present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe Wigner-Seitz cell is constructed around a central lattice point, which we place at the origin $\\mathbf{R}_0 = (0,0,0)$. The cell consists of all points $\\mathbf{r}$ such that $|\\mathbf{r}|  |\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{R}|$ for all non-zero lattice vectors $\\mathbf{R}$. This condition is equivalent to the set of half-spaces defined by $\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{R} \\le \\frac{1}{2}|\\mathbf{R}|^2$. The boundary of the cell is formed by the set of such planes that are closest to the origin.\n\n**Analysis of the Simple Cubic (SC) Lattice**\nThe lattice points are given by vectors $\\mathbf{R} = n_1 a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + n_2 a\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + n_3 a\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, where $n_1, n_2, n_3$ are integers.\n\n1.  **Nearest Neighbors**: The shortest non-zero lattice vectors connect the origin to its nearest neighbors. These are the $6$ vectors: $\\pm a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, $\\pm a\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, $\\pm a\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The squared magnitude of these vectors is $a^2$.\n2.  **Perpendicular Bisector Planes for Nearest Neighbors**:\n    - For $\\mathbf{R} = a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, the plane equation is $\\mathbf{r} \\cdot (a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) = \\frac{1}{2}a^2$, which simplifies to $x = a/2$.\n    - For $\\mathbf{R} = -a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, the plane is $x = -a/2$.\n    - Similarly, for $\\mathbf{R} = \\pm a\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ we get $y = \\pm a/2$, and for $\\mathbf{R} = \\pm a\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ we get $z = \\pm a/2$.\n    These $6$ planes define a cube centered at the origin, specified by the region $-a/2 \\le x \\le a/2$, $-a/2 \\le y \\le a/2$, and $-a/2 \\le z \\le a/2$.\n\n3.  **Next-Nearest Neighbors**: The next set of neighbors are at positions like $(\\pm a, \\pm a, 0)$ and its permutations. There are $12$ such vectors. Their squared magnitude is $a^2 + a^2 = 2a^2$.\n    - Let's consider the vector $\\mathbf{R} = a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + a\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$. The bisector plane is $\\mathbf{r} \\cdot (a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + a\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) = \\frac{1}{2}(2a^2)$, which is $x+y=a$.\n    - To determine if this plane contributes a face to the WS cell, we check if it cuts into the volume defined by the nearest-neighbor planes. The corner of the cube most in the direction of $(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}+\\hat{\\mathbf{y}})$ is at $(a/2, a/2, z)$. At any point on this edge, $x+y=a/2+a/2=a$. The plane $x+y=a$ therefore only touches the edge of the cube. It does not reduce its volume. The same applies to all $12$ planes from the next-nearest neighbors.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for SC**: The Wigner-Seitz cell is bounded exclusively by the $6$ planes from the nearest neighbors. It is a cube of side length $a$ and volume $a^3$. The conventional cell for the SC lattice is also a cube of side length $a$. Thus, for the simple cubic lattice, the Wigner-Seitz cell and the conventional cell are identical in shape and volume, differing only by a translation.\n\n**Analysis of the Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) Lattice**\nThe BCC lattice has a basis of two atoms in its conventional cubic cell of side $a$. Taking one atom at the origin $(0,0,0)$, the set of all lattice points is given by linear combinations of primitive vectors. A simpler way for the WS construction is to list the neighbor vectors from the origin. The coordinates of lattice points relative to the origin are of the form $(n_1 a, n_2 a, n_3 a)$ and $((n_1+1/2)a, (n_2+1/2)a, (n_3+1/2)a)$.\n\n1.  **Neighbor Distances**:\n    - **Nearest Neighbors (NN)**: These are the $8$ points at the centers of the adjacent conventional cells, with vectors $\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{NN}} = \\frac{a}{2}(\\pm 1, \\pm 1, \\pm 1)$. Their squared distance from the origin is $|\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{NN}}|^2 = (a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2 = 3a^2/4$.\n    - **Next-Nearest Neighbors (NNN)**: These are the $6$ points at the corners of the local conventional cell, with vectors $\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{NNN}} = (\\pm a, 0, 0)$, $(0, \\pm a, 0)$, $(0, 0, \\pm a)$. Their squared distance is $|\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{NNN}}|^2 = a^2$.\n    Since $3a^2/4  a^2$, the $8$ body-center vectors correspond to the nearest neighbors.\n\n2.  **Perpendicular Bisector Planes**:\n    - **Planes from NN**: For a vector $\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{NN}} = \\frac{a}{2}(l,m,n)$ where $l,m,n \\in \\{\\pm1\\}$, the plane equation is $\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{R}_{\\text{NN}} = \\frac{1}{2}|\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{NN}}|^2$. This becomes $\\frac{a}{2}(l x + m y + n z) = \\frac{1}{2} (3a^2/4)$, which simplifies to $l x + m y + n z = 3a/4$. There are $8$ such planes.\n    - **Planes from NNN**: For a vector $\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{NNN}} = a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, the plane is $x = a/2$. There are $6$ such planes: $x=\\pm a/2$, $y=\\pm a/2$, $z=\\pm a/2$.\n\n3.  **Constructing the Cell**: The WS cell is the intersection of all half-spaces. We must determine which planes form the boundary. A plane at a distance $d$ from the origin is a candidate. The distance to the NN planes is $d_{\\text{NN}} = \\frac{|3a/4|}{\\sqrt{1^2+1^2+1^2}} = \\frac{3a}{4\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}a}{4} \\approx 0.433a$. The distance to the NNN planes is $d_{\\text{NNN}} = a/2 = 0.5a$.\n    Although the NNN planes are further away, they can still form faces of the final polyhedron. A common way to visualize the result is to start with the cube defined by the NNN planes ($-a/2 \\le x,y,z \\le a/2$) and see how it is truncated by the NN planes.\n    Consider the corner of this cube at $(a/2, a/2, a/2)$. For the NN plane $x+y+z=3a/4$, this point gives $a/2+a/2+a/2 = 3a/2$, which is greater than $3a/4$. This means the point lies outside the half-space $x+y+z \\le 3a/4$, so the plane cuts off this corner of the cube. All $8$ corners of the cube are truncated by the $8$ NN planes.\n    The resulting polyhedron is a **truncated octahedron**. It has $14$ faces: the remaining central parts of the $6$ faces of the original cube (from the NNN planes), and $8$ new faces created by the truncation (from the NN planes).\n\n4.  **Conclusion for BCC**: The Wigner-Seitz cell is a $14$-faced truncated octahedron, bounded by planes from both the $8$ nearest neighbors and the $6$ next-nearest neighbors. Its shape is not a cube and thus does not coincide with the conventional cubic cell. The volume of the primitive cell (which is the WS cell) must be the volume of the conventional cell divided by the number of lattice points per conventional cell ($2$). Therefore, the volume is $V_{WS} = a^3/2$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A**: This option correctly states that for the SC lattice, the WS cell is a cube of side $a$ formed by the $6$ planes from nearest neighbors, which is identical in shape to the conventional cell. For the BCC lattice, it correctly identifies that both the $8$ nearest neighbors and the $6$ next-nearest neighbors contribute planes, resulting in a $14$-faced truncated octahedron. It also correctly gives the volume as $a^3/2$ and concludes that the shape does not coincide with the conventional cube. The description of plane equations and construction is physically and geometrically correct, despite a slight awkwardness in notation. **Correct**.\n\n*   **B**: This option incorrectly claims the SC Wigner-Seitz cell is a truncated octahedron and the BCC Wigner-Seitz cell is a conventional cube. Both statements are false. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C**: This option incorrectly claims the BCC Wigner-Seitz cell coincides with the conventional cell. The provided reasoning is flawed, as demonstrated by considering a point on the face of the conventional cell which can be closer to the body-centered lattice point than the origin. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D**: This option incorrectly claims the BCC Wigner-Seitz cell is a cube. The shape is a truncated octahedron. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **E**: This option incorrectly identifies the BCC Wigner-Seitz cell as a rhombic dodecahedron. The rhombic dodecahedron is the Wigner-Seitz cell for the face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice, not the BCC lattice. **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on a rigorous derivation from first principles, Option A is the only one that presents a correct analysis for both the simple cubic and body-centered cubic lattices.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2811738"}, {"introduction": "A key insight in the study of crystallography is that while a Bravais lattice has a unique primitive cell volume, the set of primitive vectors that define this cell is not unique.

It is well-posed, providing all necessary information. Let us verify the linear independence of the given vector sets. We form matrices $A$ and $B$ whose columns are the vectors of the respective bases.\n$A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  1 \\\\ 0  2  1 \\\\ 1  1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The determinant is $\\det(A) = 1(0 \\cdot 0 - 1 \\cdot 1) - 0 + 1(0 \\cdot 1 - 2 \\cdot 1) = -1 - 2 = -3$.\n$B = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  2  0 \\\\ 0  2  3 \\\\ 1  3  0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The determinant is $\\det(B) = 1(2 \\cdot 0 - 3 \\cdot 3) - 2(0 \\cdot 0 - 3 \\cdot 1) + 0 = -9 + 6 = -3$.\nSince neither determinant is zero, both sets of vectors are linearly independent. The volumes of the primitive cells, given by $|\\det(A)| = 3$ and $|\\det(B)| = 3$, are identical. This is a necessary condition for the two bases to describe the same lattice. The problem is consistent and valid. We may proceed.\n\nThe fundamental tenet of a Bravais lattice $\\mathcal{L}$ is that any point $\\mathbf{R}$ within it can be expressed as an integer linear combination of primitive vectors. Let $\\{\\mathbf{a}_1, \\mathbf{a}_2, \\mathbf{a}_3\\}$ be a primitive basis. Then for any $\\mathbf{R} \\in \\mathcal{L}$, we have $\\mathbf{R} = n_1 \\mathbf{a}_1 + n_2 \\mathbf{a}_2 + n_3 \\mathbf{a}_3$ where $n_1, n_2, n_3 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nIf $\\{\\mathbf{b}_1, \\mathbf{b}_2, \\mathbf{b}_3\\}$ is another primitive basis for the same lattice $\\mathcal{L}$, then each vector $\\mathbf{b}_j$ must itself be a point in the lattice $\\mathcal{L}$. Therefore, each $\\mathbf{b}_j$ must be expressible as an integer linear combination of the vectors $\\{\\mathbf{a}_i\\}$. We can write this relation for each $j \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{b}_j = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} U_{ij} \\mathbf{a}_i\n$$\nwhere the coefficients $U_{ij}$ must be integers. This system of equations can be represented in matrix form. Let $A$ be the matrix whose columns are the vectors $\\mathbf{a}_i$ and $B$ be the matrix whose columns are the vectors $\\mathbf{b}_j$. The relationship is then given by $B = AU$, where $U$ is a $3 \\times 3$ matrix with integer entries $U_{ij}$.\n\nConversely, since $\\{\\mathbf{b}_j\\}$ is also a primitive basis for $\\mathcal{L}$, each $\\mathbf{a}_i$ must be an integer linear combination of the vectors $\\{\\mathbf{b}_j\\}$. This implies the existence of another integer matrix, let us call it $V$, such that:\n$$\nA = BV\n$$\nSubstituting the first matrix equation into the second gives $A = (AU)V = A(UV)$. Since the vectors $\\{\\mathbf{a}_i\\}$ are linearly independent, the matrix $A$ is invertible. We can multiply by $A^{-1}$ from the left to obtain $I = UV$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. Similarly, substituting the second equation into the first gives $B = (BV)U = B(VU)$, and the invertibility of $B$ implies $I = VU$.\n\nThus, the matrices $U$ and $V$ are inverses of each other, i.e., $V = U^{-1}$. We have established that both $U$ and $V$ must have integer entries. The inverse of an integer matrix $U$ is an integer matrix if and only if the determinant of $U$ is $\\pm 1$. This can be seen from the formula for the inverse, $U^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(U)}\\text{adj}(U)$, where $\\text{adj}(U)$ is the adjugate matrix. The adjugate of an integer matrix is always an integer matrix. For $U^{-1}$ to be composed entirely of integers, it is necessary that $\\frac{1}{\\det(U)}$ be an integer, which holds only if $\\det(U) = 1$ or $\\det(U) = -1$. Therefore, any two primitive bases for the same Bravais lattice must be related by an integer matrix $U$ with $\\det(U) = \\pm 1$.\n\nNow, we must explicitly determine this matrix $U$ for the given bases. The relation is $B = AU$, which means we can find $U$ by computing $U = A^{-1}B$.\nThe matrix $A$ is $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  1 \\\\ 0  2  1 \\\\ 1  1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Its determinant has already been calculated as $\\det(A) = -3$.\nThe inverse matrix $A^{-1}$ is $\\frac{1}{\\det(A)}\\text{adj}(A)$. The adjugate matrix is the transpose of the cofactor matrix.\nThe cofactors are:\n$C_{11} = -1$, $C_{12} = 1$, $C_{13} = -2$\n$C_{21} = 1$, $C_{22} = -1$, $C_{23} = -1$\n$C_{31} = -2$, $C_{32} = -1$, $C_{33} = 2$\nThe cofactor matrix is $C = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  1  -2 \\\\ 1  -1  -1 \\\\ -2  -1  2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe adjugate matrix is $\\text{adj}(A) = C^T = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  1  -2 \\\\ 1  -1  -1 \\\\ -2  -1  2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSo, $A^{-1} = -\\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} -1  1  -2 \\\\ 1  -1  -1 \\\\ -2  -1  2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1  2 \\\\ -1  1  1 \\\\ 2  1  -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nNow we compute $U = A^{-1}B$:\n$$\nU = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1  2 \\\\ -1  1  1 \\\\ 2  1  -2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  2  0 \\\\ 0  2  3 \\\\ 1  3  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nU = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(1) + (-1)(0) + (2)(1)  (1)(2) + (-1)(2) + (2)(3)  (1)(0) + (-1)(3) + (2)(0) \\\\ (-1)(1) + (1)(0) + (1)(1)  (-1)(2) + (1)(2) + (1)(3)  (-1)(0) + (1)(3) + (1)(0) \\\\ (2)(1) + (1)(0) + (-2)(1)  (2)(2) + (1)(2) + (-2)(3)  (2)(0) + (1)(3) + (-2)(0) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nU = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} 3  6  -3 \\\\ 0  3  3 \\\\ 0  0  3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  2  -1 \\\\ 0  1  1 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe verify the properties of $U$. Its entries are indeed integers. Its determinant is:\n$$\n\\det(U) = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1  2  -1 \\\\ 0  1  1 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = 1(1 \\cdot 1 - 1 \\cdot 0) = 1\n$$\nThe determinant is $1$, which confirms that its absolute value is $1$. The fact that $U$ is an integer matrix with unit determinant verifies that the lattice generated by the columns of $B$ is the same as the lattice generated by the columns of $A$.\n\nFinally, we compute the scalar $S \\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\sum_{j=1}^{3} U_{ij}^{2}$.\n$$\nS = (1)^2 + (2)^2 + (-1)^2 + (0)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2 + (0)^2 + (0)^2 + (1)^2\n$$\n$$\nS = 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 9\n$$\nThe value of the scalar $S$ is $9$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9}$$", "id": "2811675"}]}
