The direction is determined by a vector that starts at a lattice point chosen as the origin and ends at a point with coordinates $(X, Y, Z)$. These coordinates are measured in units of the respective lattice parameters $a$, $b$, and $c$, and are found to be $X=1/2$, $Y=-3/4$, and $Z=1$.

The Miller indices for a direction are a set of the smallest possible integers that are proportional to the vector's components. Determine the Miller indices $[u, v, w]$ for this direction.
