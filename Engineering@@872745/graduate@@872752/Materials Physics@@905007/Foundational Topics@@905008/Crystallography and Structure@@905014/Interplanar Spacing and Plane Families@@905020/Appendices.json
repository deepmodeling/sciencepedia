It is scientifically grounded in the principles of crystallography, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe objective is to determine the dihedral angle between the crystallographic planes identified by the Miller indices $(1,2,0)$ and $(0,2,1)$. The dihedral angle between two planes is defined as the angle between their normal vectors. In crystallography, the normal vector to a family of planes with Miller indices $(h,k,l)$ is given by the reciprocal lattice vector $\\mathbf{G}_{hkl} = h\\mathbf{a}^* + k\\mathbf{b}^* + l\\mathbf{c}^*$, where $\\mathbf{a}^*$, $\\mathbf{b}^*$, and $\\mathbf{c}^*$ are the basis vectors of the reciprocal lattice.\n\nThe problem specifies an orthorhombic crystal lattice, for which the direct lattice basis vectors $\\mathbf{a}$, $\\mathbf{b}$, and $\\mathbf{c}$ are mutually orthogonal. We can align these with a Cartesian coordinate system without loss of generality:\n$$ \\mathbf{a} = a\\hat{i} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{b} = b\\hat{j} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{c} = c\\hat{k} $$\nwhere $\\hat{i}$, $\\hat{j}$, and $\\hat{k}$ are the orthonormal basis vectors of the Cartesian system, and $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the lattice parameters.\n\nThe reciprocal lattice basis vectors are defined by the relations provided: $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}^* = 1$, $\\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}^* = 1$, $\\mathbf{c} \\cdot \\mathbf{c}^* = 1$, and all mixed products such as $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}^*$ are zero. Let us derive the expression for $\\mathbf{a}^*$. Due to the orthogonality of the direct lattice, $\\mathbf{a}^*$ must be parallel to $\\mathbf{a}$ to satisfy $\\mathbf{a}^* \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = 0$ and $\\mathbf{a}^* \\cdot \\mathbf{c} = 0$. Thus, we can write $\\mathbf{a}^* = K \\mathbf{a}$ for some scalar $K$. The condition $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}^* = 1$ leads to:\n$$ \\mathbf{a} \\cdot (K\\mathbf{a}) = K(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}) = K|\\mathbf{a}|^2 = Ka^2 = 1 $$\nThis gives $K = 1/a^2$.

The kinematic structure factor for a reflection with Miller indices $(hkl)$ is\n$$\nF_{hkl}=\\sum_{j} f_j \\,\\exp\\!\\left(2\\pi i \\,\\mathbf{G}_{hkl}\\cdot \\mathbf{r}_j\\right),\n$$\nwhere $f_j$ is the atomic scattering factor of atom $j$, $\\mathbf{r}_j$ are atomic basis positions inside the unit cell, and $\\mathbf{G}_{hkl}$ is the reciprocal lattice vector associated with $(hkl)$. When the space group includes a translational symmetry element that maps each atom at $\\mathbf{r}$ to an equivalent atom at $\\mathbf{r}+\\mathbf{t}$ (possibly combined with a point operation that leaves $(hkl)$ invariant in phase for the reflection class considered), the corresponding contributions to the structure factor acquire a common phase factor $\\exp\\!\\left(2\\pi i \\,\\mathbf{G}_{hkl}\\cdot \\mathbf{t}\\right)$. If the sum over such cosets yields a factor that vanishes for certain $(hkl)$, those reflections are systematically absent.\n\nFirst, the observation that no peaks can be indexed with $h+k+l$ odd is the canonical signature of body centering ($I$-centering) with centering translation $\\mathbf{t}_I=(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ (in direct-lattice units). The structure factor obtains a prefactor\n$$\n1+\\exp\\!\\left(2\\pi i \\,\\mathbf{G}_{hkl}\\cdot \\mathbf{t}_I\\right)\n=1+\\exp\\!\\left[\\pi i (h+k+l)\\right]\n=1+(-1)^{\\,h+k+l},\n$$\nwhich vanishes for $h+k+l$ odd. Thus the observed global parity extinction directly indicates an $I$-centered tetragonal Bravais lattice.\n\nSecond, consider a fourfold screw axis along $c$. For reflections of the type $00l$, the rotational part about $c$ leaves the projection on $c$ invariant in phase, so only the translational component of the screw matters for the extinction. For a screw $4_1$ (translation $\\tfrac{1}{4}\\mathbf{c}$ per quarter-turn) or $4_3$ (translation $\\tfrac{3}{4}\\mathbf{c}$ per quarter-turn), the four coset-related contributions sum to\n$$\nS_{00l}^{(4_1)}=1+\\exp\\!\\left(2\\pi i \\, \\tfrac{l}{4}\\right)+\\exp\\!\\left(2\\pi i \\, \\tfrac{l}{2}\\right)+\\exp\\!\\left(2\\pi i \\, \\tfrac{3l}{4}\\right).\n$$\nThis is a finite geometric series of $4$ roots of unity that equals $0$ unless $l=4n$, in which case all terms equal $1$ and the sum is $4$. Therefore, a $4_1$ or $4_3$ screw axis along $c$ produces the observed extinction $\\{00l\\}$ present only for $l=4n$. By contrast, a $4_2$ screw would contribute only a translation $\\tfrac{1}{2}\\mathbf{c}$ per half-turn relevant for $00l$, yielding $S_{00l}^{(4_2)}=1+\\exp(i\\pi l)$, which vanishes for $l$ odd but allows all $l=2n$ (not restricted to $4n$).\n\nThird, for $\\{hk0\\}$ reflections in an $I$-centered lattice, the same centering factor $1+(-1)^{\\,h+k+l}$ reduces to $1+(-1)^{\\,h+k}$ when $l=0$, so only $h+k$ even are allowed. No additional restriction arises from a $4_1$ or $4_3$ screw along $c$ for $l=0$, because the translational part of the screw is along $c$ and contributes no phase to $l=0$ reflections.\n\nFourth, for mixed-index families such as $\\{h0l\\}$ and $\\{0kl\\}$, the $I$-centering selection rule alone imposes $h+l$ even and $k+l$ even, respectively. The observed statement that no extra systematic absences are detected beyond this parity is consistent with a body-centered tetragonal lattice with a $4_1$ (or $4_3$) screw along $c$ and no additional glide planes affecting these zones.\n\nPutting these elements together, the minimal and plausible extinction content consistent with all observations is an $I$-centered tetragonal lattice with a $4_1$ (or $4_3$) screw axis along $c$ and no additional glide-plane extinctions. The predicted observable families then are:\n- $\\{00l\\}$ with $l=4n$,\n- $\\{hk0\\}$ with $h+k=2n$,\n- general $\\{hkl\\}$ with $h+k+l=2n$,\nand similarly for $\\{h0l\\}$, $\\{0kl\\}$, etc., the parity follows from $I$-centering with no further restrictions.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. Primitive tetragonal with $4_2$ along $c$. A primitive lattice has no $h+k+l$ parity extinction; thus the observed absence of all $h+k+l$ odd reflections cannot be explained. Moreover, a $4_2$ screw would allow $\\{00l\\}$ with $l=2n$ (all even $l$), not just $l=4n$. Both points contradict the observations. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nB. Body-centered tetragonal with no screw along $c$. The $I$-centering explains the global parity $h+k+l=2n$ and $\\{hk0\\}$ with $h+k=2n$, but without a screw the $\\{00l\\}$ condition is $l=2n$, not $l=4n$. This fails to match the stricter observed extinction in $\\{00l\\}$. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. Body-centered tetragonal with a $4_1$ (or $4_3$) screw along $c$, no glides. This configuration yields exactly the observed set: $h+k+l$ odd absent (from $I$), $\\{00l\\}$ present only for $l=4n$ (from $4_1$ or $4_3$), and $\\{hk0\\}$ with $h+k=2n$ (from $I$), with no extra restrictions in mixed zones. Verdict — Correct.\n\nD. Primitive tetragonal with a glide perpendicular to $c$ and a $4_1$ screw. While the $4_1$ could explain $\\{00l\\}$ with $l=4n$, a primitive lattice cannot produce the global $h+k+l$ parity extinction. Furthermore, the stated prediction that $\\{hk0\\}$ requires both $h$ and $k$ even is not supported by the observations (which show only $h+k$ parity), and the claim that general $\\{hkl\\}$ have no parity restriction contradicts the observed global extinction.

Using cofactor expansion along the first row:\n$$\n\\Delta = S_{hh} \\begin{vmatrix} S_{kk}  S_{kl} \\\\ S_{kl}  S_{ll} \\end{vmatrix} - S_{hk} \\begin{vmatrix} S_{hk}  S_{kl} \\\\ S_{hl}  S_{ll} \\end{vmatrix} + S_{hl} \\begin{vmatrix} S_{hk}  S_{kk} \\\\ S_{hl}  S_{kl} \\end{vmatrix}\n$$\nEvaluating the $2 \\times 2$ determinants:\n$$\n\\Delta = S_{hh} (S_{kk} S_{ll} - S_{kl}^{2}) - S_{hk} (S_{hk} S_{ll} - S_{kl} S_{hl}) + S_{hl} (S_{hk} S_{kl} - S_{kk} S_{hl})\n$$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$\n\\Delta = S_{hh} S_{kk} S_{ll} - S_{hh} S_{kl}^{2} - S_{hk}^{2} S_{ll} + S_{hk} S_{kl} S_{hl} + S_{hl} S_{hk} S_{kl} - S_{hl}^{2} S_{kk}\n$$\nCombining like terms, we arrive at the final simplified expression for the determinant:\n$$\n\\Delta = S_{hh} S_{kk} S_{ll} + 2 S_{hk} S_{kl} S_{hl} - S_{hh} S_{kl}^{2} - S_{kk} S_{hl}^{2} - S_{ll} S_{hk}^{2}\n$$\nThis is the required analytic expression for the determinant of the normal-equation coefficient matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{S_{hh} S_{kk} S_{ll} + 2 S_{hk} S_{kl} S_{hl} - S_{hh} S_{kl}^{2} - S_{kk} S_{hl}^{2} - S_{ll} S_{hk}^{2}}\n$$", "id": "2830554"}]}
