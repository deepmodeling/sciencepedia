A rigorous solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem is separated into two parts. The first requires an analysis of the disjoining pressure at contact ($D \\to 0$), and the second requires a physical interpretation of the oscillation period $d$.\n\n**Part 1: Contact Pressure and Repulsion Condition**\nThe disjoining pressure is given by the expression:\n$$P(D) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{D}{\\xi}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi D}{d}+\\phi\\right)$$\nContact is defined as the limit where the separation distance $D$ approaches zero. To find the contact pressure, denoted $P(0)$, we must evaluate the limit of $P(D)$ as $D \\to 0$.\n$$P(0) = \\lim_{D\\to 0} \\left[ A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{D}{\\xi}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi D}{d}+\\phi\\right) \\right]$$\nThe exponential and cosine functions are continuous for all real arguments. Therefore, the limit can be found by direct substitution of $D=0$ into the expression.\nThe exponential term evaluates to:\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{0}{\\xi}\\right) = \\exp(0) = 1$$\nThe argument of the cosine function becomes:\n$$\\frac{2\\pi (0)}{d}+\\phi = \\phi$$\nThus, the cosine term evaluates to $\\cos(\\phi)$.\nCombining these results, the contact pressure is:\n$$P(0) = A \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\cos(\\phi) = A \\cos(\\phi)$$\nThis expression provides the value for the disjoining pressure at zero separation.\n\nThe condition for net repulsion at contact is $P(0) > 0$. Substituting the derived expression for $P(0)$, we obtain the inequality:\n$$A \\cos(\\phi) > 0$$\nThe parameter $A$ is an amplitude, which by convention is a positive-definite quantity ($A > 0$) representing the magnitude of the interaction. If $A$ were allowed to be negative, it would be absorbed into a phase shift of $\\pi$ in the cosine term. Assuming $A > 0$, the condition for repulsion simplifies to:\n$$\\cos(\\phi) > 0$$\nThis inequality is satisfied when the phase angle $\\phi$ lies in the first or fourth quadrants. Mathematically, this corresponds to the range:\n$$-\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2n\\pi  \\phi  \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2n\\pi, \\quad n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$$\nwhere $\\mathbb{Z}$ is the set of all integers.\n\nFinally, we must comment on the role of the decay length $\\xi$ and the oscillation period $d$ in determining the sign of $P(0)$. From the derivation $P(0) = A \\cos(\\phi)$, it is evident that the contact pressure is determined exclusively by the amplitude $A$ and the phase $\\phi$. The parameters $\\xi$ and $d$ do not appear in the final expression for $P(0)$. The decay length $\\xi$ governs the range of the force, i.e., how rapidly the oscillatory pressure decays to zero as $D$ increases. The period $d$ dictates the spacing between successive pressure maxima and minima. While both are critical for describing the force at finite separations $D > 0$, they have no influence on the value of the pressure precisely at contact, $D=0$.\n\n**Part 2: Microscopic Interpretation of the Oscillation Period $d$**\nThe problem statement connects the disjoining pressure to the structural correlations in the confined liquid. The oscillatory term in $P(D)$ is $\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi D}{d}+\\phi\\right)$. The spatial dependence of this term is periodic with a wavenumber $k = \\frac{2\\pi}{d}$.\n\nAccording to liquid-state theory, the density distribution of a fluid near a hard wall is not uniform but exhibits oscillations. The asymptotic behavior of the fluid density correlation function or the density profile $\\rho(z)$ normal to a wall at $z=0$ is typically a damped sinusoid:\n$$\\rho(z) - \\rho_b \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{\\xi}\\right)\\cos(k^{\\ast}z + \\delta)$$\nwhere $\\rho_b$ is the bulk fluid density, $\\xi$ is the correlation decay length, and $k^{\\ast}$ is the wavenumber of the dominant structural mode in the liquid. This wavenumber $k^{\\ast}$ is determined by the positions of the poles of the liquid's static structure factor $S(k)$ in the complex plane. For dense liquids, $k^{\\ast}$ is very close to the wavenumber $k_{peak}$ of the principal peak of $S(k)$.\n\nThe disjoining pressure $P(D)$ arises from these density oscillations as the two surfaces are brought together. The periodicity of the pressure must therefore reflect the periodicity of the underlying fluid structure. Equating the wavenumber of the pressure oscillation to the structural wavenumber of the fluid gives:\n$$\\frac{2\\pi}{d} = k^{\\ast}$$\nThe principal peak of the static structure factor, $S(k)$, occurs at a wavenumber $k_{peak}$ that is inversely related to the characteristic length scale of the liquid's short-range order.\nFor a simple liquid composed of spherical particles of effective diameter $a$, this peak occurs at $k_{peak} \\approx \\frac{2\\pi}{a}$. Since $k^{\\ast} \\approx k_{peak}$, we can write:\n$$\\frac{2\\pi}{d} \\approx \\frac{2\\pi}{a}$$\nThis leads to the microscopic interpretation: $d \\approx a$. The oscillation period $d$ of the solvation force corresponds to the effective diameter of the solvent molecules.\n\nFor an aqueous interface, the same principle holds. The \"particles\" are structured layers of water molecules. The characteristic spacing between hydration shells, denoted $\\ell$ (approximately the diameter of a water molecule, $\\sim 0.28$ nm), determines the periodicity of the density profile. The principal peak in the structure factor of water reflects this layering. Therefore, the structural wavenumber is $k^{\\ast} \\approx \\frac{2\\pi}{\\ell}$.\nBy analogy, we have:\n$$\\frac{2\\pi}{d} \\approx \\frac{2\\pi}{\\ell}$$\nThis implies $d \\approx \\ell$. In this context, the oscillation period $d$ of the hydration pressure corresponds to the spacing of the hydration layers.\nIn both cases, the parameter $d$ is a direct manifestation of the characteristic length scale of molecular ordering in the liquid confined between the surfaces.\n\nThe final answer requires only the expression for $P(0)$.

The area of each patch is $\\pi R^2$. The change in surface energy is given by $2 (\\pi R^2) (\\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{sl})$, where $\\gamma_{sv}$ and $\\gamma_{sl}$ are the solid-vapor and solid-liquid interfacial tensions, respectively. The problem provides the Young contact angle $\\theta$, which is defined by the Young's equation: $\\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{sl} = \\gamma \\cos\\theta$. Substituting this into the energy expression gives:\n$$ \\Delta\\Omega_{s} = 2\\pi R^2 (\\gamma \\cos\\theta) $$\n\n$3$. Three-Phase Contact Line Energy ($\\Delta\\Omega_{line}$):\nTwo circular three-phase contact lines are formed, one on each plate, where the solid, liquid, and vapor phases meet.

This corresponds to the derivative of the grand potential with respect to $R$ being negative in the limit $R \\to 0^{+}$. The onset of this instability occurs at the critical separation $D^{\\star}$, where this derivative is exactly zero.\nThe condition for the critical separation $D^{\\star}$ is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\Delta\\Omega(R;D^{\\star})}{\\partial R} \\bigg|_{R \\to 0^{+}} = 0 $$\n\nFirst, we compute the partial derivative of $\\Delta\\Omega(R;D)$ with respect to $R$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\Delta\\Omega(R;D)}{\\partial R} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial R} \\left( 2\\pi R D \\gamma + 2\\pi R^2 \\gamma \\cos\\theta + 4\\pi R \\tau - \\pi R^2 D \\Delta\\omega \\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\Delta\\Omega(R;D)}{\\partial R} = 2\\pi D \\gamma + 4\\pi R \\gamma \\cos\\theta + 4\\pi \\tau - 2\\pi R D \\Delta\\omega $$\n\nNext, we evaluate this derivative in the limit as $R \\to 0^{+}$:\n$$ \\lim_{R \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{\\partial \\Delta\\Omega(R;D)}{\\partial R} = \\lim_{R \\to 0^{+}} \\left( 2\\pi D \\gamma + 4\\pi R \\gamma \\cos\\theta + 4\\pi \\tau - 2\\pi R D \\Delta\\omega \\right) $$\n$$ \\lim_{R \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{\\partial \\Delta\\Omega(R;D)}{\\partial R} = 2\\pi D \\gamma + 4\\pi \\tau $$\nAs required, the terms involving $\\cos\\theta$ and $\\Delta\\omega$ vanish in this limit, as they are coefficients of terms of order $R$ in the derivative. The instability of an infinitesimal bridge is governed by the balance between the line energy and the primary surface energy term, which are both linear in $R$.\n\nFinally, we apply the critical condition by setting this limiting derivative to zero to solve for $D^{\\star}$:\n$$ 2\\pi D^{\\star} \\gamma + 4\\pi \\tau = 0 $$\n$$ 2\\pi D^{\\star} \\gamma = -4\\pi \\tau $$\n$$ D^{\\star} \\gamma = -2\\tau $$\n$$ D^{\\star} = -\\frac{2\\tau}{\\gamma} $$\n\nThis expression for the critical separation $D^{\\star}$ depends only on the liquid-vapor interfacial tension $\\gamma$ and the three-phase line tension $\\tau$, as stipulated by the problem.
