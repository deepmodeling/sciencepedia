Within the Johnson–Kendall–Roberts (JKR) theory of adhesive contact, there exists a nonzero equilibrium contact radius at zero load due to interfacial adhesion.\n\nStarting from fundamental principles, use the Griffith energy balance for an axisymmetric crack at the contact edge (equate the energy release rate to the work of adhesion) together with the classical, non-adhesive Hertz relations between load, indentation, and contact radius, to obtain the zero-load JKR contact radius $a_0$ as a function of $R$, $E^*$, and $w$.

The primary tasks are to derive the expressions for the equilibrium contact radius and indentation at zero load, compare this with the non-adhesive Hertzian model, and compute a numerical value for the contact radius.\n\nThe JKR theory is founded on a Griffith-type energy balance applied to the contact problem. The total energy of the system is the sum of the stored elastic strain energy, $U_E$, and the surface energy, $U_S$. Adhesion reduces the surface energy as contact is made, so $U_S = -wA$, where $w$ is the work of adhesion and $A$ is the contact area. For a circular contact of radius $a$, $A = \\pi a^2$. The elastic energy is stored due to the deformation of the half-space.\n\nThe equilibrium state is found by balancing the release of elastic energy with the energy required to create new surfaces at the contact edge. The Griffith criterion for equilibrium of a crack states that the energy release rate, $G$, must be equal to the work of adhesion, $w$. Applying this principle to the geometry of a spherical contact, and utilizing the elasticity solutions for a Hertzian contact, one arrives at the celebrated JKR equation relating the external applied load, $P$, to the resulting contact radius, $a$:\n$$ P(a) = \\frac{4E^{*}a^{3}}{3R} - \\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{*} a^{3}} $$\nHere, $R$ is the sphere radius and $E^{*}$ is the plane-strain composite modulus. The first term on the right-hand side represents the classical Hertzian repulsive force for a contact of radius $a$, while the second term accounts for the attractive adhesive forces concentrated at the contact perimeter.\n\nFirst, we determine the equilibrium contact radius at zero load, $a_0$. We set the external load $P=0$ in the JKR equation:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{4E^{*}a_0^{3}}{3R} - \\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{*} a_0^{3}} $$\nAssuming a non-zero contact radius, $a_0 > 0$, we can rearrange the equation:\n$$ \\frac{4E^{*}a_0^{3}}{3R} = \\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{*} a_0^{3}} $$\nSquaring both sides of the equation gives:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{4E^{*}a_0^{3}}{3R} \\right)^2 = 8\\pi w E^{*} a_0^{3} $$\n$$ \\frac{16(E^{*})^2 a_0^{6}}{9R^2} = 8\\pi w E^{*} a_0^{3} $$\nDividing by $8\\pi w E^{*} a_0^{3}$ (which is non-zero) and solving for $a_0^3$:\n$$ a_0^3 = \\frac{9R^2 \\cdot 8\\pi w E^{*}}{16(E^{*})^2} = \\frac{9\\pi w R^2}{2E^{*}} $$\nThus, the zero-load JKR contact radius is:\n$$ a_0 = \\left( \\frac{9\\pi w R^2}{2E^{*}} \\right)^{1/3} $$\n\nNext, we find the corresponding surface approach or indentation, $\\delta_0$, at zero load. The JKR theory also provides the relationship between indentation $\\delta$ and contact radius $a$:\n$$ \\delta(a) = \\frac{a^2}{R} - \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi w a}{E^{*}}} $$\nWe can simplify the second term for the zero-load case. From our equilibrium condition at $P=0$, $\\frac{4E^{*}a_0^{3}}{3R} = \\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{*} a_0^{3}}$, which can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\frac{4E^{*}a_0^{3}}{3R} = 2a_0 \\sqrt{2\\pi w E^* a_0} $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{2a_0^{2}}{3R} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi w a_0}{E^*}} $$\nNow, substituting this result into the expression for $\\delta(a_0)$:\n$$ \\delta_0 = \\frac{a_0^2}{R} - \\frac{2a_0^2}{3R} = \\frac{a_0^2}{3R} $$\nThe indentation at zero load is positive, meaning the surfaces have moved towards each other from the point of first contact.\n\nNow, we consider what the non-adhesive Hertz theory would predict for this indentation $\\delta_0$. In Hertz theory, the relationship between indentation $\\delta_H$ and contact radius $a_H$ is purely geometric:\n$$ a_H^2 = R \\delta_H $$\nIf we impose an indentation equal to the JKR zero-load value, $\\delta_H = \\delta_0 = \\frac{a_0^2}{3R}$, the corresponding Hertzian contact radius $a_H$ would be:\n$$ a_H^2 = R \\left( \\frac{a_0^2}{3R} \\right) = \\frac{a_0^2}{3} $$\n$$ a_H = \\frac{a_0}{\\sqrt{3}} $$\nSince $a_0$ is a real, positive quantity, the indentation $\\delta_0$ is also real and positive. The Hertzian contact radius $a_H$ corresponding to this positive indentation is therefore also a real, non-zero value. Thus, Hertz theory does predict a real, nonzero contact for the indentation level $\\delta_0$. However, it is important to note that in Hertz theory, a positive indentation $\\delta_0$ would require a non-zero compressive load $P_H = \\frac{4}{3}E^* R^{1/2} \\delta_0^{3/2} > 0$, whereas in JKR theory this state is achieved at $P=0$.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $a_0$.

These forces do not perturb the Hertzian stress distribution within the contact. Their net effect is equivalent to an additional attractive load, $F_{adh}$, that acts in concert with the externally applied load, $P$.\n\nWe begin with the classical Hertz theory, which relates the applied load to the contact radius for a non-adhesive, frictionless contact between a sphere and a flat surface.

Derivation of the DMT Pull-Off Force ($P_{c}^{\\mathrm{DMT}}$)**\n\nThe DMT theory is applicable to systems with relatively stiff materials and long-range adhesive forces. It assumes that the adhesive forces act outside the region of mechanical contact and do not alter the stress distribution within the contact area. The pressure distribution inside the contact is assumed to be identical to that of the non-adhesive Hertz theory.\n\nThe total applied normal force, $P$, is the sum of the elastic repulsive force from the Hertzian contact, $P_{H}$, and the attractive adhesive force, $P_{adh}$:\n$$P = P_{H} + P_{adh}$$\nThe Hertzian force is non-zero only when there is a finite contact area ($a > 0$) or equivalently, a positive indentation ($\\delta > 0$). It is given by $P_{H} = \\frac{4}{3}E^{*}R^{1/2}\\delta^{3/2}$.\n\nThe adhesive force, $P_{adh}$, is calculated using the Derjaguin approximation. This approximation relates the force between a sphere and a flat to the interaction energy per unit area, $w$, between two parallel flat surfaces. For short-range forces, this integrated attractive force is constant and given by:\n$$P_{adh} = -2\\pi R w$$\nThe negative sign indicates an attractive (tensile) force.\n\nThe total force as a function of indentation $\\delta$ is:\n$$P(\\delta) = \\frac{4}{3}E^{*}R^{1/2}\\delta^{3/2} - 2\\pi R w$$\nThe pull-off force, $P_c$, is the minimum (most negative) applied force required to maintain contact. This minimum occurs at the point of separation, which in the DMT model corresponds to zero indentation ($\\delta=0$) and zero contact radius ($a=0$). At this point, the Hertzian repulsive term vanishes.\n$$P_{c}^{\\mathrm{DMT}} = P(\\delta=0) = 0 - 2\\pi R w = -2\\pi R w$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the JKR Pull-Off Force ($P_{c}^{\\mathrm{JKR}}$)**\n\nThe JKR theory is applicable to systems with compliant materials and short-range, strong adhesive forces. In this model, the adhesive forces act within the contact area and are strong enough to deform the surfaces, increasing the contact area beyond the Hertzian prediction for a given load. The model uses a fracture mechanics analogy where the edge of the contact is treated as a crack tip.\n\nThe relationship between the applied load $P$, the contact radius $a$, and the material properties is given by the central JKR equation:\n$$P = \\frac{4E^{*}a^{3}}{3R} - \\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{*} a^{3}}$$\nThe first term represents the repulsive elastic force required to create a contact of radius $a$ (similar to Hertz theory), and the second term represents the attractive adhesive force that pulls the surfaces together.\n\nTo find the pull-off force, we must find the minimum value of $P$ with respect to the contact radius $a$. This corresponds to the point of mechanical instability, where a small decrease in load leads to a catastrophic loss of contact. We find this minimum by differentiating $P$ with respect to $a$ and setting the derivative to zero.\n$$\\frac{dP}{da} = \\frac{d}{da} \\left( \\frac{4E^{*}a^{3}}{3R} - \\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{*}} a^{3/2} \\right) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{4E^{*}}{3R}(3a^{2}) - \\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{*}} \\left(\\frac{3}{2} a^{1/2}\\right) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{4E^{*}a^{2}}{R} = \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{*}} a^{1/2}$$\nAssuming $a \\neq 0$, we can divide by $a^{1/2}$:\n$$a^{3/2} = \\frac{3R}{2 \\cdot 4E^{*}} \\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{*}} = \\frac{3R}{8E^{*}} (2\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{\\pi w E^{*}}) = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2} R \\sqrt{\\pi w}}{4\\sqrt{E^{*}}}$$\nSquaring both sides gives the cube of the contact radius at pull-off, $a_{c}$:\n$$a_{c}^{3} = \\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{2} R \\sqrt{\\pi w}}{4\\sqrt{E^{*}}}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{9 \\cdot 2 \\cdot R^{2} \\pi w}{16 E^{*}} = \\frac{9\\pi w R^{2}}{8E^{*}}$$\nNow, we substitute the values of $a_c^{3/2}$ and $a_c^3$ back into the expression for $P$ to find the pull-off force, $P_{c}^{\\mathrm{JKR}}$:\n$$P_{c}^{\\mathrm{JKR}} = \\frac{4E^{*}}{3R}a_{c}^{3} - \\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{*}}a_{c}^{3/2}$$\n$$P_{c}^{\\mathrm{JKR}} = \\frac{4E^{*}}{3R}\\left(\\frac{9\\pi w R^{2}}{8E^{*}}\\right) - \\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{*}}\\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{2} R \\sqrt{\\pi w}}{4\\sqrt{E^{*}}}\\right)$$\nEvaluating each term separately:\nThe first term simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{4 \\cdot 9}{3 \\cdot 8} \\frac{E^{*}\\pi w R^{2}}{E^{*}R} = \\frac{36}{24}\\pi w R = \\frac{3}{2}\\pi w R$$\nThe second term simplifies to:\n$$\\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{*}} \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}R\\sqrt{\\pi w}}{4\\sqrt{E^{*}}} = (2\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{\\pi w E^{*}}) \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}R\\sqrt{\\pi w}}{4\\sqrt{E^{*}}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2} \\cdot 3\\sqrt{2} \\cdot R(\\pi w)}{4} = \\frac{12\\pi w R}{4} = 3\\pi w R$$\nCombining the terms, the JKR pull-off force is:\n$$P_{c}^{\\mathrm{JKR}} = \\frac{3}{2}\\pi w R - 3\\pi w R = -\\frac{3}{2}\\pi w R$$\n\n**3.

Physical Origin of the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the two predictions stems fundamentally from where adhesive tractions act and how they couple with elastic deformation.\n\nIn the **DMT model**, adhesive forces are considered long-range and act outside the mechanical contact zone. They do not cause elastic deformation. The pull-off event occurs when the contact area shrinks to zero ($a=0$). At this point, there is no repulsive Hertzian force, and the pull-off force is purely the total integrated attractive force from the surrounding non-contact area, which equals $-2\\pi R w$.\n\nIn the **JKR model**, adhesive forces are short-range and act within the contact area, which they deform and enlarge. The pull-off is an instability event that occurs at a finite contact radius, $a_{c} > 0$. At the moment of pull-off, the stress distribution under the contact includes both a central compressive region (resisting deformation) and a strong tensile region at the contact edge (due to adhesion). The net applied force, $P$, is the integral of this complex stress distribution. The existence of a residual elastic compressive force partially counteracts the adhesive tension. At pull-off, the total internal tensile force due to adhesion is $3\\pi w R$, while the internal compressive force from elastic repulsion is $\\frac{3}{2}\\pi w R$. The net force that must be supplied externally is their sum, $P_{c}^{\\mathrm{JKR}} = -\\frac{3}{2}\\pi w R$.\n\nIn summary, the JKR pull-off force is smaller in magnitude because detachment is an instability of a finite-sized contact where elastic compressive stresses still exist and partially offset the adhesive tensile stresses. The DMT force is larger in magnitude because it represents a pure, un-opposed adhesive attraction at the point of zero contact area.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}$$", "id": "2763419"}]}
