The system consists of a liquid droplet on a solid surface in a vapor environment. The total excess interfacial free energy, $G$, of the system is the sum of the energies of the solid-liquid (SL), solid-vapor (SV), and liquid-vapor (LV) interfaces.\n\nLet $A_{SL}$, $A_{SV}$, and $A_{LV}$ be the areas of the solid-liquid, solid-vapor, and liquid-vapor interfaces, respectively. The corresponding interfacial free energy densities (surface tensions) are $\\gamma_{SL}$, $\\gamma_{SV}$, and $\\gamma_{LV}$. The total interfacial free energy is given by:\n$$ G = \\gamma_{SL} A_{SL} + \\gamma_{SV} A_{SV} + \\gamma_{LV} A_{LV} $$\nThe solid surface is planar and assumed to be large. The droplet base on the solid is a circle of radius $r$. Thus, $A_{SL} = \\pi r^2$. The total area of the solid surface is constant, so $A_{SL} + A_{SV} = \\text{constant}$. This implies that any change in $A_{SL}$ is matched by an opposite change in $A_{SV}$, i.e., $dA_{SV} = -dA_{SL}$. We can therefore write the energy relative to a completely dry surface ($A_{SL}=0$), focusing on the change in energy upon wetting:\n$$ \\Delta G = (\\gamma_{SL} - \\gamma_{SV}) A_{SL} + \\gamma_{LV} A_{LV} $$\nThe system is at equilibrium when its total free energy is at a minimum for a fixed droplet volume $V$. We find the stationarity condition by considering a virtual displacement of the three-phase contact line. Let the contact line, a circle of radius $r$, expand by an infinitesimal amount $dr$. This corresponds to a virtual displacement of the contact line by $dx=dr$ along the solid surface.\n\nThe resulting differential changes in the interfacial areas are:\n$1$. The solid-liquid area increases. The change is $dA_{SL} = 2\\pi r dr$.\n$2$. The solid-vapor area decreases by the same amount: $dA_{SV} = -2\\pi r dr$.\n$3$. The change in the liquid-vapor area, $dA_{LV}$, must also be considered. A full variational calculation, which maintains a constant droplet volume, shows that for a small change in the contact radius $dr$, the corresponding change in the liquid-vapor area is given by $dA_{LV} = 2\\pi r \\cos\\theta \\, dr$.\n\nThe total differential change in the free energy, $dG$, is the sum of the changes from each interface:\n$$ dG = \\gamma_{SL} dA_{SL} + \\gamma_{SV} dA_{SV} + \\gamma_{LV} dA_{LV} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the differential areas:\n$$ dG = \\gamma_{SL} (2\\pi r dr) + \\gamma_{SV} (-2\\pi r dr) + \\gamma_{LV} (2\\pi r \\cos\\theta \\, dr) $$\nFactoring out the common term $(2\\pi r dr)$:\n$$ dG = (\\gamma_{SL} - \\gamma_{SV} + \\gamma_{LV} \\cos\\theta) (2\\pi r dr) $$\nAt equilibrium, the free energy must be stationary with respect to this virtual displacement, meaning $dG=0$. Since the displacement $dr$ is non-zero, the term in the parentheses must be zero. This gives the stationarity condition:\n$$ \\gamma_{SL} - \\gamma_{SV} + \\gamma_{LV} \\cos\\theta = 0 $$\nRearranging this equation yields the well-known Young's equation for the equilibrium contact angle $\\theta$:\n$$ \\gamma_{SV} = \\gamma_{SL} + \\gamma_{LV} \\cos\\theta $$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNext, we evaluate the contact angle using the provided data:\n$\\gamma_{LV} = 72 \\text{ mN/m} = 0.072 \\text{ J/m}^2$\n$\\gamma_{SV} = 0.40 \\text{ J/m}^2$\n$\\gamma_{SL} = 0.10 \\text{ J/m}^2$\n\nFrom Young's equation, we solve for $\\cos\\theta$:\n$$ \\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\gamma_{SV} - \\gamma_{SL}}{\\gamma_{LV}} $$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$ \\cos\\theta = \\frac{0.40 - 0.10}{0.072} = \\frac{0.30}{0.072} $$\nThe calculation yields:\n$$ \\cos\\theta = \\frac{300}{72} = \\frac{150}{36} = \\frac{75}{18} = \\frac{25}{6} \\approx 4.167 $$\nThis result, $\\cos\\theta > 1$, is outside the mathematically permissible range of the cosine function, which is $[-1, 1]$. Therefore, there is no real angle $\\theta$ that can satisfy the Young equation for this set of interfacial energies. The system cannot achieve mechanical equilibrium at the contact line.\n\nWe must now analyze the physical meaning of this outcome. The Young equation represents a balance of generalized forces at the contact line. The condition $\\cos\\theta > 1$ arises when $\\gamma_{SV} - \\gamma_{SL} > \\gamma_{LV}$. This inequality means that the net energy gain from wetting the solid surface ($\\gamma_{SV} - \\gamma_{SL}$) is greater than the maximum possible opposing energy cost from creating new liquid-vapor surface area ($\\gamma_{LV}$, which occurs when $\\cos\\theta=1$).\nConsequently, there is a net driving force that continuously pulls the contact line outward, causing the droplet to spread. The total free energy of the system decreases monotonically as the droplet spreads. The system will therefore evolve to the state of minimum possible free energy, which corresponds to maximizing the solid-liquid area $A_{SL}$. For a droplet of fixed volume, this physical process is known as complete wetting. The liquid spreads to form a thin film covering the solid surface.\n\nThe physically realized limiting state that minimizes the free energy is a completely wetted surface. In this state, the macroscopic contact angle, measured as the angle between the solid substrate and the tangent to the liquid surface, is zero.\nThus, the physically admissible equilibrium macroscopic contact angle is $\\theta = 0^\\circ$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2797949"}, {"introduction": "Real-world surfaces are rarely the perfectly smooth, flat planes assumed in the ideal Young's model.

The total energy is given by the sum of the energies of the three interfaces:\n$$G = \\gamma_{LV} A_{LV} + \\gamma_{SL} A_{SL} + \\gamma_{SV} A_{SV}$$\nwhere $\\gamma_{LV}$, $\\gamma_{SL}$, and $\\gamma_{SV}$ are the liquid-vapor, solid-liquid, and solid-vapor interfacial tensions, respectively, and $A_{LV}$, $A_{SL}$, and $A_{SV}$ are the corresponding interfacial areas.\n\nThe total true surface area of the solid, $A_{S, \\text{true}}$, is constant. It is partitioned between the wetted area, $A_{SL}$, and the dry area, $A_{SV}$. Thus, $A_{S, \\text{true}} = A_{SL} + A_{SV}$, which implies $A_{SV} = A_{S, \\text{true}} - A_{SL}$.

The term $\\gamma_{SV} A_{S, \\text{true}}$ is a constant and does not contribute to the variation. Thus, we must have:\n$$dG = \\gamma_{LV} dA_{LV} + (\\gamma_{SL} - \\gamma_{SV}) dA_{SL} = 0$$\nWe now relate the differential changes in area, $dA_{LV}$ and $dA_{SL}$, to a differential change in the projected wetted area, $dA_{\\text{proj}}$. The problem states that the liquid follows the surface topography. The roughness factor is defined as $r = \\frac{A_{\\text{true}}}{A_{\\text{proj}}}$. For a differential change, this means the true change in solid-liquid area, $dA_{SL}$, is related to the change in its horizontal projection, $dA_{\\text{proj}}$, by:\n$$dA_{SL} = r \\, dA_{\\text{proj}}$$\nThe change in the liquid-vapor area, $dA_{LV}$, is related to the displacement of the contact line along the projected plane. For a small advance of the contact line creating a new projected wetted area $dA_{\\text{proj}}$, the corresponding change in the liquid-vapor area is the projection of this new area onto the tangent of the droplet surface at the contact line.

The surface chemistry is homogeneous, so the solid-vapor and solid-liquid interfacial energies are spatially uniform. The contact line is driven quasi-statically toward the stripe by a prescribed capillary driving force per unit length $f_{\\mathrm{drive}}$ (for example, due to a slight macroscopic tilt or a controlled chemical potential difference). Assume the substrate behaves as a linear-elastic half-space locally near the contact line, and that the contact line deforms the solid through a localized traction set by capillarity. \n\nStarting from the following fundamental base:\n- Minimization of total free energy (sum of interfacial energies and elastic strain energy).\n- The static force balance at the contact line on a rigid substrate described by the Young equation.\n- Linear elasticity of a half-space, and the empirical fact that the elastic energy stored by a line traction on a half-space scales inversely with Young’s modulus.\n\nUsing these bases, derive a predictive criterion to decide whether the contact line becomes pinned at the stiffness discontinuity. Your derivation must explicitly construct the relevant energy and force scales and connect them through a consistent length scale for the transition region. You may introduce a dimensionless geometric factor $c$ (order unity) that multiplies the elastic energy scale to represent the dependence on geometry and Poisson’s ratio; this $c$ will be provided as an input parameter.

Elastic cost of deforming a soft solid by a line traction: A three-phase contact line pulls up a “wetting ridge” on a soft solid. In linear elasticity for a half-space, the stored elastic energy per unit length created by a line load scales as the square of the applied line force divided by the elastic modulus.
