The validation of the problem statement confirms that it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution under a standard physical approximation.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested. First, we determine the curvature of the liquid-vapor meniscus. Second, we use this result along with principles of thermodynamic and mechanical equilibrium to derive the expression for $\\ln(p/p_{\\text{sat}})$.\n\nPart 1: Determination of the Meniscus Curvature\n\nThe equilibrium state is governed by two conditions: mechanical equilibrium across the liquid-vapor interface and phase equilibrium between the liquid and vapor.\n\nBy the spherical symmetry of the cavity of radius $r$, any stable, static meniscus formed inside must also be spherical to minimize surface energy for a given volume. A spherical surface is characterized by two equal principal radii of curvature, $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$. Let $R_{1} = R_{2} = R_{m}$, where $R_{m}$ is the radius of the meniscus.\n\nThe problem describes capillary condensation, where vapor condenses into a liquid that wets the cavity walls. The liquid therefore forms a film lining the solid surface, and the vapor occupies the central core. The meniscus is the interface between the liquid and the vapor.\n\nThe condition of perfect wetting (zero Young contact angle) implies that the liquid spreads completely over the solid surface. In the context of pore condensation, this is conventionally interpreted to mean that the characteristic radius of curvature of the meniscus is dictated by the pore geometry itself. For a spherical cavity of radius $r$, the meniscus is thus a concentric sphere of radius $r$. Therefore, we have $R_{m} = r$.\n\nNext, we must establish the sign of the radii of curvature. The problem provides the sign convention: a radius of curvature is positive if its center of curvature lies on the vapor side. In our system, the liquid lines the cavity wall, and the vapor forms a core at the center. The center of the spherical meniscus, which is also the center of the cavity, is located within the vapor phase. Consequently, according to the given convention, the principal radii are positive: $R_{1} = +r$ and $R_{2} = +r$.\n\nThe signed sum of the principal curvatures is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{R_{1}} + \\frac{1}{R_{2}} = \\frac{1}{r} + \\frac{1}{r} = \\frac{2}{r}\n$$\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the expression for $\\ln(p/p_{\\mathrm{sat}})$\n\nWe begin with the condition for thermodynamic equilibrium between the liquid and vapor phases at temperature $T$: the chemical potentials must be equal.\n$$\n\\mu_{\\ell}(p_{\\ell}, T) = \\mu_{v}(p, T)\n$$\nwhere $p_{\\ell}$ is the pressure within the liquid phase and $p$ is the pressure of the vapor.\n\nFor a flat interface, equilibrium occurs at the saturation pressure $p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T)$, where $\\mu_{\\ell}(p_{\\mathrm{sat}}, T) = \\mu_{v}(p_{\\mathrm{sat}}, T)$. We can express the chemical potentials at arbitrary pressures relative to this saturation state.\n\nFor the liquid, assumed to be incompressible with molar volume $v_{\\ell}$, the change in chemical potential with pressure is given by $d\\mu_{\\ell} = v_{\\ell} dP$. Integrating from $p_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ to $p_{\\ell}$ yields:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\ell}(p_{\\ell}, T) - \\mu_{\\ell}(p_{\\mathrm{sat}}, T) = \\int_{p_{\\mathrm{sat}}}^{p_{\\ell}} v_{\\ell} dP = v_{\\ell} (p_{\\ell} - p_{\\mathrm{sat}})\n$$\n\nFor the vapor, assumed to behave as an ideal gas, the chemical potential is $\\mu_{v}(p, T) = \\mu_{v}^{\\circ}(T) + RT \\ln(p)$. The change from the saturation state is:\n$$\n\\mu_{v}(p, T) - \\mu_{v}(p_{\\mathrm{sat}}, T) = RT \\ln(p) - RT \\ln(p_{\\mathrm{sat}}) = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p_{\\mathrm{sat}}}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the equilibrium condition $\\mu_{\\ell}(p_{\\ell}, T) = \\mu_{v}(p, T)$ and using the flat-interface equilibrium condition $\\mu_{\\ell}(p_{\\mathrm{sat}}, T) = \\mu_{v}(p_{\\mathrm{sat}}, T)$ to cancel terms, we obtain:\n$$\nv_{\\ell} (p_{\\ell} - p_{\\mathrm{sat}}) = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p_{\\mathrm{sat}}}\\right)\n$$\nThis equation connects the thermodynamic state of the system. We now introduce the condition of mechanical equilibrium. The pressure difference across the curved liquid-vapor interface is given by the Young-Laplace equation:\n$$\n\\Delta p = p - p_{\\ell} = \\gamma \\left(\\frac{1}{R_{1}} + \\frac{1}{R_{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThe pressure is higher on the concave side of the meniscus. Since the meniscus is concave toward the vapor core, the vapor pressure $p$ is higher than the liquid pressure $p_{\\ell}$. From Part 1, the sum of curvatures is $2/r$. Thus:\n$$\np - p_{\\ell} = \\gamma \\left(\\frac{2}{r}\\right) \\implies p_{\\ell} = p - \\frac{2\\gamma}{r}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $p_{\\ell}$ into the thermodynamic equilibrium equation gives:\n$$\nv_{\\ell} \\left( \\left(p - \\frac{2\\gamma}{r}\\right) - p_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\right) = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p_{\\mathrm{sat}}}\\right)\n$$\nThis equation is exact under the stated assumptions but is an implicit equation for the equilibrium pressure $p$. To obtain the requested closed-form expression for $\\ln(p/p_{\\mathrm{sat}})$, a standard and physically justified approximation is necessary. For significant capillary effects in small pores, the pressure drop across the interface, $p-p_{\\ell}$, is typically much larger than the deviation of the vapor pressure from saturation, $p-p_{\\mathrm{sat}}$. We thus make the approximation $p \\approx p_{\\mathrm{sat}}$. With this, the term $p_{\\ell} - p_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ becomes:\n$$\np_{\\ell} - p_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\approx p_{\\ell} - p = -\\frac{2\\gamma}{r}\n$$\nSubstituting this approximation into the thermodynamic equilibrium relation $v_{\\ell} (p_{\\ell} - p_{\\mathrm{sat}}) = RT \\ln(p/p_{\\mathrm{sat}})$:\n$$\nv_{\\ell} \\left(-\\frac{2\\gamma}{r}\\right) = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p_{\\mathrm{sat}}}\\right)\n$$\nRearranging to solve for the desired quantity, we arrive at the Kelvin equation for a spherical cavity:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p_{\\mathrm{sat}}}\\right) = -\\frac{2\\gamma v_{\\ell}}{rRT}\n$$\nThis expression depends only on the given parameters $r$, $\\gamma$, $v_{\\ell}$, $R$, and $T$, as required.

The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions, vagueness, or pseudoscientific claims. Therefore, the problem is declared **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe fundamental condition for phase equilibrium between the liquid and vapor phases at constant temperature $T$ is the equality of their chemical potentials, $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mu_{l}(T, p_{l}) = \\mu_{v}(T, p)\n$$\nwhere $p_{l}$ is the pressure within the liquid phase and $p$ is the pressure of the vapor phase in the nanopore.\n\nThe reference state for both phases is the state of saturation over a planar interface, where the pressure is $p_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ in both phases (by definition) and the chemical potentials are equal: $\\mu_{l}(T, p_{\\mathrm{sat}}) = \\mu_{v}(T, p_{\\mathrm{sat}})$.\n\nFor an incompressible liquid (idealization ii), the change in chemical potential with pressure is given by the differential relation $\\mathrm{d}\\mu_{l} = V_{m}\\mathrm{d}p_{l}$. Integrating from the reference pressure $p_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ to the liquid pressure $p_{l}$ yields:\n$$\n\\mu_{l}(T, p_{l}) - \\mu_{l}(T, p_{\\mathrm{sat}}) = \\int_{p_{\\mathrm{sat}}}^{p_{l}} V_{m} \\mathrm{d}p' = V_{m}(p_{l} - p_{\\mathrm{sat}})\n$$\n\nFor the vapor, behaving as an ideal gas (idealization i), the molar volume is $V_{m,v} = \\frac{RT}{p}$, where $R$ is the universal gas constant. The change in chemical potential with pressure is $\\mathrm{d}\\mu_{v} = V_{m,v}\\mathrm{d}p = \\frac{RT}{p}\\mathrm{d}p$.

For a concave meniscus, the center of curvature is in the vapor phase, meaning the vapor pressure $p$ is higher than the liquid pressure $p_{l}$. The pressure jump is $\\Delta p = p - p_{l}$.\nThe problem states the meniscus is a spherical surface, so its principal radii of curvature are equal, $R_{1} = R_{2} = r_{m}$, where $r_{m}$ is the radius of the meniscus. The Young-Laplace equation becomes:\n$$\n\\Delta p = p - p_{l} = \\gamma \\left(\\frac{1}{r_{m}} + \\frac{1}{r_{m}}\\right) = \\frac{2\\gamma}{r_{m}}\n$$\nFrom this, we express the liquid pressure as $p_{l} = p - \\frac{2\\gamma}{r_{m}}$. Substituting this into the thermodynamic relation:\n$$\nV_{m}\\left(p - \\frac{2\\gamma}{r_{m}} - p_{\\mathrm{sat}}\\right) = RT\\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p_{\\mathrm{sat}}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is an implicit equation. For capillary condensation, the deviation of the vapor pressure $p$ from $p_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ is small, while the pressure drop in the liquid, $\\Delta p$, can be large. Thus, we can make the standard and accurate approximation $p_{l} - p_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\approx p_{l} - p = -\\Delta p = -\\frac{2\\gamma}{r_{m}}$. This simplifies the thermodynamic relation to the Kelvin equation:\n$$\nRT\\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p_{\\mathrm{sat}}}\\right) = -V_{m} \\frac{2\\gamma}{r_{m}}\n$$\nNext, we relate the meniscus radius $r_{m}$ to the pore geometry. For a cylindrical pore of radius $r_{p}$ and a meniscus with contact angle $\\theta$ (measured through the liquid), simple geometric construction shows that $r_{p} = r_{m} \\cos\\theta$. Therefore, the radius of the meniscus is $r_{m} = \\frac{r_{p}}{\\cos\\theta}$. This is valid for a wetting liquid where $\\theta  \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and the meniscus is concave.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $r_{m}$ into the Kelvin equation gives:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p_{\\mathrm{sat}}}\\right) = -\\frac{2 \\gamma V_{m}}{RT} \\frac{1}{r_{m}} = -\\frac{2 \\gamma V_{m}}{RT} \\frac{\\cos\\theta}{r_{p}}\n$$\nWe are asked to find the sensitivity, which is the partial derivative of this expression with respect to $\\cos\\theta$. We treat all other parameters ($\\gamma$, $V_{m}$, $r_{p}$, $R$, $T$) as constants for this differentiation.\nLet $x = \\cos\\theta$. The expression is:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p_{\\mathrm{sat}}}\\right) = -\\left(\\frac{2 \\gamma V_{m}}{r_{p} R T}\\right) x\n$$\nThe derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial(\\cos\\theta)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p_{\\mathrm{sat}}}\\right) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\left[ -\\left(\\frac{2 \\gamma V_{m}}{r_{p} R T}\\right) x \\right] = -\\frac{2 \\gamma V_{m}}{r_{p} R T}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the sensitivity.\n\nInterpretation:\nThe sensitivity, $-\\frac{2 \\gamma V_{m}}{r_{p} R T}$, is negative, as all quantities ($\\gamma, V_{m}, r_{p}, R, T$) are intrinsically positive.\n- A negative sign implies that as $\\cos\\theta$ increases (i.e., as the contact angle $\\theta$ decreases, making the surface more wetting), the value of $\\ln(p/p_{\\mathrm{sat}})$ decreases. This means capillary condensation occurs at a lower relative pressure $p/p_{\\mathrm{sat}}$. Therefore, functionalizing a surface to be more hydrophilic (more wetting to water) enhances its ability to induce condensation.\n- The magnitude of the sensitivity scales as $\\frac{\\gamma V_{m}}{r_{p} T}$. This shows that the ability to tune condensation pressure by altering surface wettability is most pronounced for fluids with high surface tension $\\gamma$ and large molar volume $V_{m}$ (though $V_{m}$ is typically for the incompressible liquid phase and does not vary much), in smaller pores (small $r_{p}$), and at lower temperatures (small $T$).

For a wetting liquid ($\\theta  90^{\\circ}$), the meniscus is concave, and the pressure in the liquid is lower than in the vapor.\nThe geometry of a spherical cap in a cylinder of radius $r_p$ with contact angle $\\theta$ dictates that the radius of curvature is $r_m = r_p / \\cos\\theta$.\nTherefore, the Laplace pressure is $p_v - p_l = \\frac{2\\gamma\\cos\\theta}{r_p}$, which gives $p_l = p_v - \\frac{2\\gamma\\cos\\theta}{r_p}$.\nSubstituting this into the thermodynamic equilibrium equation:\n$$ V_m \\left( p_v - \\frac{2\\gamma\\cos\\theta}{r_p} - p_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\right) = RT\\ln(p_v/p_{\\mathrm{sat}}) $$\nSince the liquid molar volume $V_m$ is much smaller than the vapor molar volume, the term $V_m(p_v - p_{\\mathrm{sat}})$ is negligible compared to the other terms.

The corresponding Kelvin thresholds satisfy...**\n\nThis statement correctly identifies that adsorption corresponds to an advancing meniscus ($\\theta_A$) and desorption to a receding meniscus ($\\theta_R$).\nThe Kelvin equations for the condensation pressure ($p_{\\mathrm{cond}}$) and evaporation pressure ($p_{\\mathrm{evap}}$) are correctly written using the appropriate angles:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{cond}}}{p_{\\mathrm{sat}}}\\right) = -\\frac{2\\gamma V_m}{r_p RT}\\cos\\theta_A $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{evap}}}{p_{\\mathrm{sat}}}\\right) = -\\frac{2\\gamma V_m}{r_p RT}\\cos\\theta_R $$\nSubtracting the second equation from the first gives:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{cond}}}{p_{\\mathrm{sat}}}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{evap}}}{p_{\\mathrm{sat}}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{cond}}}{p_{\\mathrm{evap}}}\\right) = -\\frac{2\\gamma V_m}{r_p RT}(\\cos\\theta_A - \\cos\\theta_R) = \\frac{2\\gamma V_m}{r_p RT}(\\cos\\theta_R - \\cos\\theta_A) $$\nExponentiating both sides gives the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{cond}}}{p_{\\mathrm{evap}}} = \\exp\\left[\\frac{2\\gamma V_m}{r_p RT}(\\cos\\theta_R - \\cos\\theta_A)\\right] $$\nThis matches the expression in the option.\nGiven the condition $\\theta_R  \\theta_A  90^{\\circ}$, and knowing that the cosine function is monotonically decreasing on $[0, 90^{\\circ}]$, it follows that $\\cos\\theta_R  \\cos\\theta_A$. Therefore, the term $(\\cos\\theta_R - \\cos\\theta_A)$ is positive. All other physical constants ($\\gamma, V_m, r_p, R, T$) are also positive. The exponent is positive, so $\\exp(\\text{positive})  1$.\nThis implies $p_{\\mathrm{cond}}  p_{\\mathrm{evap}}$, meaning the adsorption branch is at a higher relative pressure than the desorption branch, which correctly describes the resulting hysteresis loop.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The Kelvin thresholds depend linearly on the angle itself (in radians), not on $\\cos\\theta$, so that...**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The derivation of the Kelvin equation for a cylindrical pore explicitly shows that the dependence arises from the geometry of the spherical cap, where the radius of curvature $r_m$ is related to the pore radius $r_p$ by $r_m = r_p / \\cos\\theta$. The dependence is on $\\cos\\theta$, not $\\theta$. The provided formula is inconsistent with the physical derivation.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. In long cylindrical pores, the meniscus recedes during adsorption and advances during desorption...**\n\nThis statement incorrectly describes the motion of the meniscus. Adsorption involves filling the pore, so the liquid front **advances**. Desorption involves emptying the pore, so the liquid front **recedes**. The premise of this option is the opposite of the physical reality. Consequently, a swap of the angles follows ($\\theta_R$ for adsorption, $\\theta_A$ for desorption), leading to the erroneous conclusion that $p_{\\mathrm{cond}}  p_{\\mathrm{evap}}$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The Kelvin relation for capillary condensation in a cylinder depends only on $r_p$ and is independent of any contact angle...**\n\nThis statement is false. As derived, the Kelvin equation explicitly contains the term $\\cos\\theta$. For a liquid to wet the solid, a contact angle must exist, and its value directly influences the equilibrium pressure. Only in the idealized, special case of perfect wetting ($\\theta = 0$) does $\\cos\\theta$ become $1$, but this does not negate the dependence; it merely fixes the value. The claim of general independence is incorrect. Consequently, the conclusion that contact angle hysteresis cannot produce isotherm hysteresis is also false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. For a non-wetting system with $\\theta_A  \\theta_R  90^{\\circ}$ so that $\\cos\\theta  0$ on both branches...**\n\nThis option considers a non-wetting scenario. In the interval $(90^{\\circ}, 180^{\\circ}]$, the cosine function is negative. Let us re-examine the Kelvin equation:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p_{\\mathrm{sat}}}\\right) = -\\frac{2\\gamma V_m \\cos\\theta}{r_p RT} $$\nSince all terms on the right-hand side are positive except for $\\cos\\theta$, which is now negative, the entire right-hand side becomes positive:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p_{\\mathrm{sat}}}\\right) = -(\\text{positive constant}) \\times (\\text{negative value})  0 $$\nThis holds for both $\\theta = \\theta_A$ and $\\theta = \\theta_R$, as both are greater than $90^{\\circ}$. If $\\ln(p/p_{\\mathrm{sat}})  0$, then $p/p_{\\mathrm{sat}}  1$, which means $p  p_{\\mathrm{sat}}$. This signifies that the vapor must be supersaturated for the liquid to be at equilibrium within the non-wetting pore. Spontaneous capillary condensation requires lowering the system's free energy, which for a non-wetting liquid in a pore can only happen at $p  p_{\\mathrm{sat}}$. Therefore, no capillary condensation can occur at undersaturation ($p  p_{\\mathrm{sat}}$). The statement correctly concludes that adsorption-driven filling below saturation is precluded, regardless of the magnitude of contact angle hysteresis (as long as both angles remain $ 90^{\\circ}$).\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "2794220"}]}
