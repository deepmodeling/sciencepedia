The given numerical values are physically realistic. The derivation of the Stoney equation from first principles is a standard, non-trivial problem in the mechanics of materials.\n\nThe objective is to derive the relationship between the in-plane film stress $\\sigma_f$ and the induced substrate curvature $\\kappa$, and then to compute the numerical value of the stress.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the principles of mechanical equilibrium and linear elastic plate theory. Consider a coordinate system where the substrate mid-plane lies in the $x$-$y$ plane, so the substrate occupies the domain $-t_s/2 \\le z \\le t_s/2$. The thin film of thickness $t_f$ is deposited on the top surface, occupying the domain $t_s/2 < z \\le t_s/2+t_f$.\n\nThe uniform equi-biaxial stress $\\sigma_f$ within the film gives rise to an in-plane force per unit width, $F_f$, acting along the film's cross-section. This force is given by:\n$$ F_f = \\sigma_f t_f $$\nDue to the assumption $t_f \\ll t_s$, the neutral axis of the composite structure remains essentially at the mid-plane of the substrate ($z=0$). The force $F_f$ in the film acts at an effective distance from this neutral axis. The moment arm is the distance from the neutral axis to the mid-plane of the film, which is $z = t_s/2 + t_f/2$. Given $t_f \\ll t_s$, this lever arm is approximated as $t_s/2$.\n\nThis force creates a bending moment per unit width, $M$, that acts on the substrate. This moment is the product of the force per unit width and the lever arm:\n$$ M = F_f \\cdot \\left(\\frac{t_s}{2}\\right) = (\\sigma_f t_f) \\frac{t_s}{2} $$\nThis moment, applied by the film, causes the substrate to bend. The substrate, being an elastic plate, develops an internal resisting moment. According to the linear theory of isotropic plates, the relationship between the principal bending moments per unit width ($M_x$, $M_y$) and the principal curvatures ($\\kappa_x$, $\\kappa_y$) is:\n$$ M_x = D (\\kappa_x + \\nu_s \\kappa_y) $$\n$$ M_y = D (\\kappa_y + \\nu_s \\kappa_x) $$\nHere, $D$ is the flexural rigidity of the substrate plate, defined as:\n$$ D = \\frac{E_s t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s^2)} $$\nwhere $E_s$ is the Young's modulus and $\\nu_s$ is the Poisson's ratio of the substrate.\n\nThe problem states that the bending is equi-biaxial, meaning the curvature is the same in all in-plane directions. Thus, $\\kappa_x = \\kappa_y = \\kappa = 1/R$. The internal moments are also equi-biaxial, $M_x = M_y = M_s$. Substituting the equi-biaxial curvature into the moment-curvature relation gives:\n$$ M_s = D (\\kappa + \\nu_s \\kappa) = D(1+\\nu_s)\\kappa $$\nSubstituting the expression for $D$:\n$$ M_s = \\frac{E_s t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s^2)}(1+\\nu_s)\\kappa = \\frac{E_s t_s^3 (1+\\nu_s)}{12(1-\\nu_s)(1+\\nu_s)}\\kappa $$\n$$ M_s = \\frac{E_s t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s)}\\kappa $$\nThis internal resisting moment $M_s$ must balance the external moment $M$ applied by the film for the system to be in static equilibrium.

It is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. We shall proceed with a rigorous derivation from first principles.\n\nFirst, we establish a coordinate system where the substrate lies in the $x$-$y$ plane, and the $z$-axis is normal to the surface. The origin, $z=0$, is placed at the geometric mid-plane of the substrate. Per the problem's simplifying assumptions, this is also the neutral plane of bending. The substrate thus occupies the domain $-t_s/2 \\le z \\le t_s/2$. The thin films are deposited on the top surface, from $z=t_s/2$ upwards.\n\nThe composite structure of films and substrate is a closed system with no external forces or moments applied. Therefore, at equilibrium, the total moment of all internal stresses, integrated over the entire cross-section, must be zero. We can express this condition as:\n$$ M_{total} = M_{substrate} + M_{films} = 0 $$\nwhere $M_{substrate}$ and $M_{films}$ are the moments per unit width generated by the stresses within the substrate and films, respectively, referenced to the neutral plane ($z=0$).\n\nThe moment in the substrate, $M_{substrate}$, arises from the bending-induced stresses. For an isotropic plate under equi-biaxial curvature $\\kappa$, the bending strain at a distance $z$ from the neutral plane is $\\epsilon_{bend}(z) = -\\kappa z$. The corresponding stress under plane-stress conditions is given by:\n$$ \\sigma_{s,bend}(z) = \\frac{E_s}{1-\\nu_s} \\epsilon_{bend}(z) = -\\frac{E_s \\kappa z}{1-\\nu_s} $$\nThe total stress in the substrate also includes a uniform component to maintain force equilibrium, but this component does not contribute to the moment integral about the mid-plane. The substrate's internal moment is then:\n$$ M_{substrate} = \\int_{-t_s/2}^{t_s/2} \\sigma_{s,bend}(z) z \\, dz = \\int_{-t_s/2}^{t_s/2} \\left(-\\frac{E_s \\kappa z}{1-\\nu_s}\\right) z \\, dz $$\n$$ M_{substrate} = -\\frac{E_s \\kappa}{1-\\nu_s} \\int_{-t_s/2}^{t_s/2} z^2 \\, dz $$\nThe integral is the second moment of area per unit width of the substrate's rectangular cross-section, which evaluates to $t_s^3/12$.\n$$ M_{substrate} = -\\frac{E_s \\kappa}{1-\\nu_s} \\frac{t_s^3}{12} $$\n\nThe moment from the films, $M_{films}$, is generated by the residual stresses $\\sigma_{f1}$ and $\\sigma_{f2}$. The total stress in the films after bending is the sum of the initial residual stress and the bending-induced stress. However, the problem states that the film bending stiffness is negligible. This is a key assumption which implies that the stress contribution from the film bending itself is ignored. Thus, we consider only the residual stresses, $\\sigma_{f1}$ and $\\sigma_{f2}$, which are uniform within their respective layers.

A solution will now be derived from first principles.\n\nThe solution requires three steps: first, establishing the physical relationship between the sign of the film stress $\\sigma_f$ and the sign of the mechanics-based curvature $\\kappa$; second, defining the mathematical transformations to reconcile instrument readings with the mechanics convention; and\nthird, outlining an experimental procedure to validate the entire process.\n\n**Derivation of the Stress-Curvature Sign Relationship**\nA film with tensile stress ($\\sigma_f > 0$) is in a state of tension. As it is bonded to the substrate, it exerts a contractile force on the substrate's top surface. This force distribution generates a bending moment on the substrate. The Stoney equation is derived under the assumption that the film is much thinner than the substrate ($t_f \\ll t_s$), which implies the neutral axis of the composite system is approximately at the mid-plane of the substrate (defined as $z=0$). The film is located on the top surface of the substrate, so its mid-plane is at a positive z-coordinate, approximately $z \\approx t_s/2$.\n\nThe force per unit width in the film is $F_f = \\sigma_f t_f$. This force acts at the film's mid-plane, creating a bending moment per unit width, $M$, on the substrate about the neutral axis:\n$$M \\approx F_f \\times (\\text{moment arm}) = (\\sigma_f t_f) \\left(\\frac{t_s}{2}\\right)$$\nThe constitutive relation for an equibiaxially bent plate relates this applied moment $M$ to the resulting curvature $\\kappa$:\n$$M = \\left(\\frac{E_s t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s)}\\right) \\kappa$$\nCombining these equations yields the Stoney equation:\n$$\\sigma_f = \\frac{E_s t_s^2}{6(1-\\nu_s)t_f} \\kappa$$\nThe term multiplying $\\kappa$ consists of material properties ($E_s$, $\\nu_s$) and geometric dimensions ($t_s$, $t_f$), all of which are positive quantities (assuming $\\nu_s < 1$, which is always true for engineering materials). Therefore, the coefficient is a positive constant. This leads to the fundamental relationship:\n$$\\mathrm{sign}(\\sigma_f) = \\mathrm{sign}(\\kappa)$$\nA tensile film ($\\sigma_f > 0$) induces a positive curvature ($\\kappa > 0$). According to the problem's mechanics convention, $\\kappa > 0$ defines a concave-up profile, meaning the center of the wafer is deflected upward (toward the film) relative to its edges.\n\n**Reconciliation of Instrument Conventions**\nA unified curvature $\\kappa$ based on the mechanics convention must be adopted. The raw outputs $k_1$ and $k_2$ from the instruments must be converted to this standard.\n- Instrument $I_1$: A positive reading $k_1 > 0$ signifies a shape that is \"convex on the film side\". This means the film-side surface bulges out, and the center is lower than the edges. This is a concave-down shape, which corresponds to a negative curvature in the mechanics convention, $\\kappa < 0$. Thus, the correct conversion is $\\kappa = -k_1$.\n- Instrument $I_2$: A positive reading $k_2 > 0$ signifies a shape that is \"concave on the film side\". This means the film-side surface forms a depression, and the center is higher than the edges. This is a concave-up shape, corresponding to a positive curvature $\\kappa > 0$. Thus, the correct conversion is $\\kappa = +k_2$.\n\n**Experimental Validation**\nTo confirm that the sign conversions are correctly implemented in software or analysis, it is imperative to measure a reference sample with a known sign of stress. A standard reference material, such as a silicon wafer with a Low Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (LPCVD) silicon nitride film, is typically in high tensile stress ($\\sigma_f > 0$).\nAccording to our derivation, this tensile reference sample must result in a positive mechanics-based curvature, $\\kappa > 0$, after conversion. If, upon measuring the reference sample, the calculated $\\kappa$ (and consequently the calculated $\\sigma_f$) is found to be negative for a given instrument's data, it proves that the assumed sign convention for that instrument was incorrect. The conversion rule for that instrument must then be inverted (e.g., if $\\kappa = -k_1$ gave the wrong sign, it must be changed to $\\kappa = +k_1$).\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Define a unified curvature $\\kappa$ by the mechanics convention above. Use $\\kappa = -k_1$ for instrument $I_1$ and $\\kappa = +k_2$ for instrument $I_2$ because convex-on-film-side is concave-down. Since the film-induced resultant moment about the mid-plane is $M_f = \\int_{\\text{film}} \\sigma_f z\\, dA$ with $z>0$, static equilibrium $M_f + M_s = 0$ with $M_s = -D\\,\\kappa$ (biaxial bending stiffness $D>0$) implies $\\mathrm{sign}(\\kappa)=\\mathrm{sign}(\\sigma_f)$. Therefore, a tensile reference film (e.g., a Low Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (LPCVD) silicon nitride wafer with $\\sigma_f>0$) must yield $\\kappa>0$ (center higher than edges on the film side) after conversion. If either instrument’s converted $\\kappa$ or the reported stress sign disagrees, flip that instrument’s sign mapping.**\nThis option correctly identifies the conversions $\\kappa = -k_1$ and $\\kappa = +k_2$. The reasoning for the sign relationship $\\mathrm{sign}(\\kappa)=\\mathrm{sign}(\\sigma_f)$ is physically sound, even if the notation for moments ($M_s = -D\\kappa$) is slightly unconventional, it yields the correct final relationship. The proposed validation procedure using a tensile reference to check for $\\kappa > 0$ and to correct the sign mapping if necessary is robust and standard practice.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Average the two instruments’ raw outputs by taking $\\kappa = (k_1 + k_2)/2$; the averaging cancels sign-convention differences. Validate the sign by checking that the tensile reference gives a nonzero curvature magnitude $|\\kappa|$ close to expectation, regardless of sign.**\nThis procedure is fundamentally flawed. If a wafer has a true curvature $\\kappa_{true}$, the instruments should ideally report $k_2 = \\kappa_{true}$ and $k_1 = -\\kappa_{true}$. Averaging them would yield $\\kappa = (k_1 + k_2)/2 = (-\\kappa_{true} + \\kappa_{true})/2 = 0$. This method does not reconcile conventions but rather erroneously cancels the measurement. Ignoring the sign during validation defeats the purpose of the exercise.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Keep each instrument’s curvature sign as-is but assign a negative film thickness $t_f<0$ for the instrument that reports the opposite sign so that the product in the Stoney relation changes sign. Verify with a tensile reference by requiring the computed stress be negative to indicate consistency.**\nThis is an unphysical and illogical approach. Film thickness $t_f$ is a positive, physical quantity. Using a negative value is an arbitrary mathematical trick that has no basis in physics. The validation procedure is self-contradictory: it requires that a known tensile ($\\sigma_f > 0$) sample yield a negative stress to be considered \"consistent\". This is absurd.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Reconcile the instruments by altering the substrate’s Poisson’s ratio as $\\nu_s \\to -\\nu_s$ in the stress computation for one instrument, which flips the stress sign in the Stoney relation. Validate using a compressive reference instead of a tensile one, because compressive films are less sensitive to sign errors.**\nThis approach is also unphysical. The Poisson's ratio $\\nu_s$ is a fundamental material constant. Artificially negating it is not a valid scientific method. Furthermore, the claim that compressive films are \"less sensitive to sign errors\" is baseless; the sign is equally critical for both tensile and compressive stress.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Curvature sign is intrinsically ambiguous in optical instruments; report only $|\\kappa|$ and $|\\sigma_f|$ to avoid confusion. Validate using a tensile reference by matching the expected magnitude, without regard to sign.**\nThis option is based on a false premise and recommends an unacceptable practice. The sign of curvature (concave vs. convex) is not \"intrinsically ambiguous\" and can be determined by properly configured measurement systems. Reporting only the magnitude of the stress, $|\\sigma_f|$, discard's crucial information about whether the film is in tension or compression, which is often the most important result of the measurement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2785387"}]}
