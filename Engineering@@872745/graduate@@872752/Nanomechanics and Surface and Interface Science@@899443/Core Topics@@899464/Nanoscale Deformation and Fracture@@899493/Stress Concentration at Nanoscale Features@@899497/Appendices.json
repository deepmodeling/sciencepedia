This physical picture provides a direct path to the analysis model.\n\n1.  **Poisson Process and Waiting Time Statistics**\n    A memoryless process is mathematically described by Poisson statistics. If the constant rate of an event (in this context, dislocation nucleation) is $k$, then the probability of the event occurring for the first time in the interval $(t, t+dt)$ is given by the probability density function $p(t) = k e^{-kt}$. The cumulative distribution function, representing the probability that the event has occurred by time $t$, is $F(t) = 1 - e^{-kt}$.\n    The problem provides the *median* waiting time, $t_{50}$, which is the time by which the event has occurred with a probability of $0.5$.\n    $$F(t_{50}) = 1 - e^{-k t_{50}} = 0.5$$\n    Solving this for the rate $k$ gives:\n    $$e^{-k t_{50}} = 0.5$$\n    $$-k t_{50} = \\ln(0.5) = -\\ln(2)$$\n    $$k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{50}}$$\n    This fundamental relation allows us to compute the nucleation rate $k(T)$ at each temperature $T$ from the supplied median waiting time $t_{50}(T)$.\n\n2.  **Transition State Theory and the Arrhenius Relation**\n    The temperature dependence of the rate constant for a thermally activated process is described by Transition State Theory (TST). The rate is given by the Arrhenius equation:\n    $$k(T) = \\nu_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right)$$\n    Here, $\\Delta G$ is the Gibbs activation free energy barrier, $\\nu_0$ is the effective attempt frequency, $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The problem specifies that $\\Delta G$ and $\\nu_0$ are to be treated as functions of the notch radius $r$, but independent of temperature over the given range.\n\n3.  **Linearization for Parameter Extraction**\n    By equating the two expressions for the rate $k(T)$, we establish the relationship between the measurable quantities ($t_{50}, T$) and the desired physical parameters ($\\Delta G, \\nu_0$):\n    $$\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{50}(T)} = \\nu_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right)$$\n    To solve for $\\Delta G$ and $\\nu_0$, we linearize this equation by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $$\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{50}(T)}\\right) = \\ln(\\nu_0) + \\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right)\\right)$$\n    $$\\ln(k(T)) = \\ln(\\nu_0) - \\frac{\\Delta G}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}} \\frac{1}{T}$$\n    This equation is in the form of a straight line, $y = c + mx$, where:\n    -   Dependent variable: $y = \\ln(k(T)) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{50}(T)}\\right)$\n    -   Independent variable: $x = \\frac{1}{T}$\n    -   Intercept: $c = \\ln(\\nu_0)$\n    -   Slope: $m = -\\frac{\\Delta G}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}$\n\n4.  **Linear Least-Squares Regression**\n    For each test case, we are given $N$ pairs of $(T_i, t_{50,i})$. We first transform these into a set of $(x_i, y_i)$ points as defined above. We then perform a linear least-squares regression to find the slope $m$ and intercept $c$ that best fit these points. The formulas for $m$ and $c$ are derived by minimizing the sum of squared residuals, and are given by:\n    $$m = \\frac{N \\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i y_i) - (\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i)(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i)}{N \\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i^2) - (\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i)^2}$$\n    $$c = \\bar{y} - m\\bar{x} \\quad \\text{where } \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i \\text{ and } \\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i$$\n    As the problem forbids the use of pre-packaged fitting utilities, these explicit formulas must be implemented.\n\n5.  **Extraction of Physical Parameters**\n    Once the slope $m$ and intercept $c$ are determined, the physical parameters are recovered:\n    -   Activation Barrier: $\\Delta G = -m \\cdot k_{\\mathrm{B}}$\n    -   Attempt Frequency: $\\nu_0 = \\exp(c)$\n    The units will be electronvolts ($eV$) for $\\Delta G$ and inverse seconds ($s^{-1}$) for $\\nu_0$, consistent with the provided value for $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ and the use of seconds for time.\n\n### Part II: Proposed Atomistic Simulation Protocol\n\nTo generate the input data ($t_{50}$ vs. $T$) used in Part I, one would conduct a series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The protocol is as follows:\n\n1.  **System Construction**: An atomistic model of a crystal is created. A surface notch with specified geometry ($a, r$) is machined into the model. An appropriate interatomic potential (e.g., EAM for metals) must be chosen to describe atomic interactions accurately.\n2.  **Thermostating and Loading**: The system is brought to a target temperature $T$ using a thermostat. The prescribed far-field stress $\\sigma$ is applied via controlled boundary conditions. The system is then equilibrated under load, allowing the stress field to stabilize.\n3.  **Production Runs for First-Passage Time**: A long MD simulation is run at constant volume and temperature (NVT ensemble). The configuration is monitored continuously for the nucleation of a dislocation, identified by structural analysis algorithms (e.g., Common Neighbor Analysis). The time elapsed until nucleation is recorded as one waiting time sample.\n4.  **Statistical Collection**: The nucleation event is stochastic. Therefore, step 3 is repeated many times ($N_{trials} \\gg 1$) with different initial random velocities to obtain a statistical distribution of waiting times.\n5.  **Data Extraction**: From the collected set of $N_{trials}$ waiting times, the median value, $t_{50}$, is computed.\n6.  **Parameter Sweep**: The entire procedure (steps 2-5) is repeated for each temperature $T$ in the desired range, yielding a dataset of $(T_i, t_{50,i})$ pairs for a fixed geometry. The protocol is then repeated for different notch radii $r$ to map the functions $\\Delta G(r)$ and $\\nu_0(r)$.\n\nThis protocol constitutes a standard \"computational experiment\" in the field and would produce the data provided in the problem statement.\n\n### Part III: Program Implementation\n\nThe analysis pipeline derived in Part I is implemented for each of the three test cases. For each case:\n1.  The input arrays of temperatures $T$ and median waiting times $t_{50}$ are defined.\n2.  The transformation to linear coordinates is performed: $x_i = 1/T_i$ and $y_i = \\ln(\\ln(2)/t_{50,i})$.\n3.

The slope $m$ and intercept $c$ are calculated using the formulas from Part I.\n5.  The activation energy $\\Delta G$ and attempt frequency $\\nu_0$ are calculated from $m$ and $c$, using the provided value of $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$.\n6.  The resulting numbers are rounded to three significant figures. A numerical-to-string conversion using a format specifier like `\"{:.3g}\"` is a robust method to achieve this.\n7.
