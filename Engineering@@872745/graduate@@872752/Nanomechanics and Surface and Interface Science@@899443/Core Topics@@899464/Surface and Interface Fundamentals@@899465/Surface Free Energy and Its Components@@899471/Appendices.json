All necessary parameters and physical assumptions are provided, the model itself is scientifically grounded for pedagogical purposes, and its application requires a systematic derivation based on crystallographic and energetic principles. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a rigorous solution will be provided.\n\nThe surface free energy, $\\gamma$, represents the excess Gibbs free energy per unit area of a newly created surface relative to the bulk. In the context of a simple pairwise bonding model at zero temperature, this is equivalent to the work done per unit area to create the surface, which is stored as potential energy in the broken bonds. For a cleavage process that creates two identical surfaces from a single crystal, the energy of one surface is half the energy of all bonds severed per unit area of the cleavage plane.\n\nFirst, we must characterize the face-centered cubic (fcc) $(100)$ surface. The side length of the conventional cubic unit cell is given as $a$. The area of the $(100)$ face of this cell is $A_{\\mathrm{cell}} = a^2$. This face contains one atom at its center and four atoms at its corners, with each corner atom shared by four adjacent cells in that plane. Thus, the number of atoms per unit area on the $(100)$ plane, the atomic surface density $\\rho_s$, is:\n$$ \\rho_s = \\frac{1 + 4 \\times \\frac{1}{4}}{a^2} = \\frac{2}{a^2} $$\nIn a bulk fcc crystal, each atom has a coordination number of $Z_B = 12$ nearest neighbors. An atom on an ideal, unrelaxed $(100)$ surface has $4$ nearest neighbors in the plane of the surface, $4$ in the layer immediately below, and would have had $4$ in the layer above, which is now absent. Therefore, the coordination number of a surface atom is $Z_s = 4 + 4 = 8$.\nThe number of bonds broken per surface atom, $N_{\\mathrm{broken}}$, is the difference between the bulk and surface coordination numbers:\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{broken}} = Z_B - Z_s = 12 - 8 = 4 $$\nThe energy required to break a single nearest-neighbor bond is given as $\\varepsilon$. The creation of a surface cleaves bonds, and the energy of each severed bond, $\\varepsilon$, is partitioned equally between the two resulting surfaces. The energy cost attributed to one surface atom is therefore:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{atom, unrelaxed}} = N_{\\mathrm{broken}} \\times \\frac{1}{2}\\varepsilon = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{2}\\varepsilon = 2\\varepsilon $$\nThe unrelaxed surface free energy, $\\gamma_0$, is this energy cost per atom multiplied by the atomic surface density $\\rho_s$:\n$$ \\gamma_0 = E_{\\mathrm{atom, unrelaxed}} \\times \\rho_s = (2\\varepsilon) \\left(\\frac{2}{a^2}\\right) = \\frac{4\\varepsilon}{a^2} $$\nNext, we consider the relaxation process. This process lowers the total energy of the surface. The reduction in surface free energy, $\\Delta \\gamma = \\gamma_0 - \\gamma_{\\mathrm{relax}}$, is equivalent to the energy gained per unit area from this relaxation. We can calculate this energy gain by analyzing the changes per surface atom.\nAccording to the problem statement:\n1.  The $4$ bonds between a top-layer atom and the subsurface layer strengthen. The magnitude of each bond energy increases from $\\varepsilon$ to $\\varepsilon(1+\\alpha)$. The energy of the system decreases, corresponding to an energy gain of $\\alpha\\varepsilon$ per bond. The total gain from this effect is $4\\alpha\\varepsilon$.\n2.  One additional \"rebond\" is formed with a bond energy of magnitude $f\\varepsilon$. This formation releases energy, resulting in an energy gain of $f\\varepsilon$.\n\nThe total energy gain per surface atom, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{atom, relax}}$, is the sum of these contributions:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{atom, relax}} = 4\\alpha\\varepsilon + f\\varepsilon = (4\\alpha + f)\\varepsilon $$\nThe reduction in surface free energy, $\\Delta \\gamma$, is this energy gain per atom multiplied by the atomic surface density $\\rho_s$:\n$$ \\Delta \\gamma = \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{atom, relax}} \\times \\rho_s = (4\\alpha + f)\\varepsilon \\left(\\frac{2}{a^2}\\right) = \\frac{2\\varepsilon(4\\alpha + f)}{a^2} $$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the reduction in surface free energy.

First Principles**\nThe component-based analysis (vOCG or OWK) aims to solve a system of equations derived from the Young-Dupré equation. For a given probe liquid ($L$), the equation is:\n$$ W_{SL} = \\gamma_{LV} (1 + \\cos \\theta_0) $$\nwhere $W_{SL}$ is the work of adhesion between the solid ($S$) and liquid ($L$), and $\\theta_0$ is the intrinsic Young's contact angle. This angle is valid only for an ideal surface: perfectly smooth, chemically homogeneous, rigid, and inert. The work of adhesion is expressed in terms of surface energy components, for example, using the vOCG framework:\n$$ W_{SL} = 2\\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{LW}} \\gamma_L^{\\mathrm{LW}}} + 2\\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{+} \\gamma_L^{-}} + 2\\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{-} \\gamma_L^{+}} $$\nCombining these gives the equation to be solved:\n$$ \\gamma_{LV} (1 + \\cos \\theta_0) = 2\\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{LW}} \\gamma_L^{\\mathrm{LW}}} + 2\\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{+} \\gamma_L^{-}} + 2\\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{-} \\gamma_L^{+}} $$\nThe core issue is that the experimental data provide an apparent angle, $\\theta^*$, not the intrinsic angle, $\\theta_0$. The colleague's proposal to substitute $\\theta^*$ for $\\theta_0$ is incorrect because the surface is non-ideal. We must analyze the effects of roughness and heterogeneity.\n\n**2. Effect of Roughness**\nThe surface has nanoscale roughness ($h_{\\mathrm{rms}} = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $a = 30\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) and a roughness factor $r = 1.20$. The macroscopic droplet ($R \\approx 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) averages over this texture, as $a \\ll R$. We must consider two primary wetting states on a rough surface:\n-   **Wenzel State:** The liquid completely penetrates the roughness grooves. The apparent angle, $\\theta_W^*$, is given by Wenzel's equation:\n    $$ \\cos \\theta_W^* = r \\cos \\theta_0 $$\n-   **Cassie-Baxter State:** The liquid sits atop the roughness features, trapping vapor pockets. This state is not explicitly suggested by the data; the observed angles ($81^\\circ$, $66^\\circ$) are not in the superhydrophobic regime where this state is most common. The Wenzel state is the default model for a fully wetted rough texture.\n\nAssuming the Wenzel state applies, using the apparent angle $\\theta^* = \\theta_W^*$ directly in the Young-Dupré equation leads to a biased (apparent) work of adhesion, $W_{SL}^*$:\n$$ W_{SL}^* = \\gamma_{LV} (1 + \\cos \\theta_W^*) = \\gamma_{LV} (1 + r \\cos \\theta_0) $$\nThe true work of adhesion is $W_{SL} = \\gamma_{LV} (1 + \\cos \\theta_0)$.\nSince $r = 1.20 > 1$:\n-   If the intrinsic surface is hydrophilic ($\\theta_0  90^{\\circ}$, so $\\cos \\theta_0 > 0$), then $r \\cos \\theta_0 > \\cos \\theta_0$, which implies $W_{SL}^* > W_{SL}$. The work of adhesion is overestimated.\n-   If the intrinsic surface is hydrophobic ($\\theta_0 > 90^{\\circ}$, so $\\cos \\theta_0  0$), then $r \\cos \\theta_0  \\cos \\theta_0$, which implies $W_{SL}^*  W_{SL}$. The work of adhesion is underestimated.\nFor the given liquids, $\\theta_W^*$ is acute, so it is almost certain that $\\theta_0$ is also acute. Therefore, direct use of $\\theta^*$ will overestimate $W_{SL}$ and lead to erroneously inflated values for the fitted surface energy components ($\\gamma_{S}^{\\mathrm{LW}}$, $\\gamma_{S}^{+}$, $\\gamma_{S}^{-}$).\n\n**3. Effect of Chemical Heterogeneity**\nThe surface is a composite of polar patches ($f_P = 0.30$) and a nonpolar matrix ($1 - f_P = 0.70$). The patch size is on the scale of the correlation length, $a = 30\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, which is much smaller than the droplet radius $R$. In this limit, the macroscopic contact angle represents an average over the different chemical domains. According to Cassie's law for chemical heterogeneity, the cosine of the effective intrinsic angle, $\\theta_0^{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is the area-weighted average of the cosines of the intrinsic angles on each domain (polar, $P$, and backbone, $B$):\n$$ \\cos \\theta_0^{\\mathrm{eff}} = f_P \\cos \\theta_P + (1 - f_P) \\cos \\theta_B $$\nTherefore, even after correcting for roughness, the resulting angle $\\theta_0$ is an effective angle $\\theta_0^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ that represents the composite surface, not a single homogeneous material. The component analysis will yield *effective* surface energy components for this composite.\n\n**4. Combined Effects and Correction Strategy**\nA proper analysis must sequentially correct for these effects.\n-   First, relate the measured apparent angle $\\theta^*$ to the effective intrinsic angle $\\theta_0^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ using the appropriate roughness model. Given the data, the Wenzel model is the most reasonable starting point.\n    $$ \\cos \\theta_0^{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\cos \\theta^*}{r} $$\n-   Second, the presence of significant contact angle hysteresis ($\\Delta \\theta \\approx 12-20^{\\circ}$) indicates that the measured \"static\" angle $\\theta^*$ is not a unique thermodynamic value. Hysteresis arises from the pinning of the contact line on roughness and chemical defects. A robust analysis must account for this by using the advancing ($\\theta_A^*$) and receding ($\\theta_R^*$) angles to bracket the range of possible outcomes. One would compute $\\cos \\theta_{0,A}^{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\cos \\theta_A^*}{r}$ and $\\cos \\theta_{0,R}^{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\cos \\theta_R^*}{r}$ and perform the component analysis for both limits to obtain a range (an error bar) for the inferred surface energy components.\n-   The final step is to use the corrected angle, $\\cos \\theta_0^{\\mathrm{eff}}$, in the component analysis equation.\n\nThe correct procedure is therefore: 1. Measure advancing and receding apparent angles. 2. Correct these angles for roughness using the Wenzel equation (assuming a fully wetted state). 3. Use the resulting range of effective intrinsic angles in the vOCG/OWK equations to calculate a range of values for the surface energy components.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n-   **A. Direct use of $\\theta^{*}$ is unbiased because macroscopic angles always average out nanoscale details; no correction is needed.**\n    This is incorrect. The averaging process itself, described by Wenzel's and Cassie's laws, introduces a systematic bias. The apparent angle $\\theta^*$ is not equal to the intrinsic angle $\\theta_0$. Thus, a correction is mandatory. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **B. On a rough but fully wetted texture, the Wenzel state amplifies $|\\cos \\theta|$ by the roughness factor $r$, so using $\\theta^{*}$ in place of the intrinsic Young angle $\\theta_{0}$ biases the Dupré work of adhesion high when $\\cos \\theta_{0} > 0$ (hydrophilic) and low when $\\cos \\theta_{0}  0$ (hydrophobic), inflating or deflating the fitted $\\gamma_{S}$ components accordingly. A correction is to determine the wetting state per liquid, use the Wenzel relation to recover $\\cos \\theta_{0} = \\frac{\\cos \\theta^{*}}{r}$ when fully wetted ($a \\ll R$ and no trapped vapor), account for chemical heterogeneity by Cassie chemical mixing $\\cos \\theta_{0}^{\\mathrm{eff}} = f_{P} \\cos \\theta_{P} + (1 - f_{P}) \\cos \\theta_{B}$ at submicrometric patch sizes, and then perform the component analysis with the corrected intrinsic angle(s), propagating bounds from advancing–receding bracketing.**\n    This option is comprehensive and physically sound. It correctly identifies the Wenzel state for a \"fully wetted texture\" and the direction of the bias on the work of adhesion. It proposes the correct Wenzel correction ($\\cos \\theta_0 = \\frac{\\cos \\theta^*}{r}$) under the appropriate physical conditions ($a \\ll R$, no trapped vapor). It correctly notes that the resulting intrinsic angle is an effective one due to chemical heterogeneity, governed by Cassie's mixing rule. Finally, it correctly advocates for propagating uncertainty by using advancing and receding angles to handle the observed hysteresis. This entire pipeline is a textbook example of a rigorous analysis. **Correct**.\n\n-   **C. Roughness only alters the solid–vapor surface free energy and leaves the Dupré work $W_{SL}$ invariant, so using $\\theta^{*}$ directly yields correct $\\gamma_{S}$ components; heterogeneity is irrelevant at macroscopic scales.**\n    This is incorrect. Roughness increases the area of both the solid-vapor and solid-liquid interfaces. Wenzel's equation, $\\cos \\theta_W^* = r \\cos \\theta_0$, demonstrates that the apparent angle is modified, which directly alters the calculation of the work of adhesion if $\\theta^*$ is used. $W_{SL}$ is thus not invariant to the choice of angle. Heterogeneity is also not irrelevant; its effect is averaged by the macroscopic droplet according to Cassie's Law, which must be accounted for. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **D. The cleanest fix is to switch to nanodroplets with $R \\sim a$ so each droplet probes a single domain, measure $\\theta^{*}$ there, and treat those measurements as intrinsic for component analysis; line tension and pinning at that scale are negligible.**\n    This is incorrect. While probing a single domain is an interesting experimental idea, the assumption that line tension and pinning are negligible at the nanoscale ($R \\sim a \\sim 30\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) is fundamentally wrong. Line tension effects scale as $1/R$ and become dominant for nanodroplets. Similarly, pinning effects at the boundaries of chemical domains or at individual roughness features would be extremely strong for a droplet of comparable size, making it impossible to measure a meaningful thermodynamic contact angle. This \"fix\" introduces more severe and less tractable complications. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **E. Because the surface is rough, the correct model is a Cassie–Baxter composite state with trapped vapor, so one should apply a vapor-fraction correction using a solid fraction estimated from AFM topography to back out $\\theta_{0}$ before component analysis; advancing–receding averaging is unnecessary.**\n    This is incorrect. It makes two flawed assertions. First, it dogmatically assumes a Cassie-Baxter state without justification; the Wenzel state is equally, if not more, plausible for the given angles. The wetting state must be determined, not assumed. Second, and more critically, it claims that accounting for hysteresis (\"advancing–receding averaging\") is \"unnecessary.\" The large measured hysteresis ($\\Delta \\theta \\approx 12-20^{\\circ}$) is a dominant experimental feature indicating significant energy barriers. Ignoring it constitutes a scientifically invalid simplification and discards crucial information about the system's energetics and the uncertainty of the measurement. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2791738"}]}
