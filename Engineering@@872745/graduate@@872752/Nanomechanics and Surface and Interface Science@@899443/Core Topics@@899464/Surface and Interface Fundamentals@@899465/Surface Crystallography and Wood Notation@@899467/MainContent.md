## Introduction
The [atomic structure](@entry_id:137190) of a crystal surface is the gateway to its interaction with the outside world, governing everything from chemical reactivity and catalysis to electronic properties and [thin-film growth](@entry_id:184789). To manipulate and understand these properties, we first need a precise, unambiguous language to describe the arrangement of atoms at the surface. This is the central role of [surface crystallography](@entry_id:203129). This field addresses the challenge of moving from the perfect, infinite lattice of a bulk crystal to the complex, often rearranged, two-dimensional world of a surface, which may host ordered layers of foreign atoms or reconstruct itself into entirely new periodicities.

This article provides a graduate-level introduction to the essential notations and concepts of [surface crystallography](@entry_id:203129). Across three chapters, you will gain a systematic understanding of this foundational topic in [surface science](@entry_id:155397).

*   The first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, lays the theoretical groundwork. We will start with the basics of describing ideal crystal planes using Miller indices and then introduce the five 2D Bravais lattices. You will learn the rigorous matrix notation for describing any commensurate superstructure and master its relationship to the more common and intuitive Wood's notation, which is essential for reading the scientific literature.

*   The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, bridges theory and practice. We will explore how experimental techniques like Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) directly reveal surface structures and how their results are translated into crystallographic notation. We will also examine the physical origins of complex reconstructions, [moiré patterns](@entry_id:276058) in 2D materials, and the [crystallography](@entry_id:140656) of stepped surfaces, connecting these ideas to broader topics in materials science and [condensed matter](@entry_id:747660) physics.

*   Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section provides targeted exercises designed to solidify your understanding. By working through problems on aligned, rotated, and centered overlayers, you will develop the practical skills needed to analyze real-world surface structures.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The atomic structure of a [crystal surface](@entry_id:195760) is fundamental to its physical and chemical properties. Understanding and describing this structure requires a precise and systematic notational framework. This chapter introduces the principles of [surface crystallography](@entry_id:203129), beginning with the description of ideal, bulk-terminated surfaces and progressing to the more complex notations required for reconstructed surfaces and adsorbate overlayers.

### Describing the Ideal Surface: From 3D Planes to 2D Nets

The orientation of an ideal crystal surface is defined by the crystallographic plane to which it is parallel. This plane is specified using **Miller indices**, denoted as $(hkl)$. The procedure for determining these indices begins with finding the intercepts of the plane with the crystallographic axes, expressed as fractional multiples ($p, q, r$) of the lattice basis vectors ($\mathbf{a}_1, \mathbf{a}_2, \mathbf{a}_3$). The reciprocals of these intercepts ($1/p, 1/q, 1/r$) are then taken and cleared of fractions to yield the smallest possible set of integers $h, k,$ and $l$. For instance, a plane intersecting the axes at $2a$, $3a$, and $-a$ in a cubic crystal would have intercepts $(2, 3, -1)$. The reciprocals are $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, -1)$, and multiplying by the least common multiple (6) gives the Miller indices $(3, 2, -6)$, where the negative index is often written with a bar, $(3, 2, \bar{6})$ [@problem_id:2790336]. A plane that is parallel to an axis is considered to have an intercept at infinity, and its corresponding Miller index is zero. Thus, a plane parallel to the $y$-axis will always have indices of the form $(h0l)$ [@problem_id:2790336].

These indices for a single plane, $(hkl)$, should be distinguished from other related notations:
*   **Crystallographic directions** are denoted by square brackets, $[uvw]$. These indices represent the integer components of a vector along that direction, reduced to the smallest integer set. For example, a vector from the origin to the point $(a, 2a, -3a)$ defines the $[1, 2, \bar{3}]$ direction [@problem_id:2790336].
*   **Families of crystallographically equivalent planes** are denoted by curly braces, $\{hkl\}$. For example, in a cubic crystal, the $\{100\}$ family includes the $(100)$, $(010)$, $(001)$, $(\bar{1}00)$, $(0\bar{1}0)$, and $(00\bar{1})$ planes.
*   **Families of crystallographically equivalent directions** are denoted by angle brackets, $\langle uvw \rangle$. In a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal, $\langle 110 \rangle$ represents the set of 12 directions equivalent to $[110]$ by symmetry [@problem_id:2790336].

A common misconception is that the direction $[hkl]$ is always perpendicular to the plane $(hkl)$. This relationship holds true for all cubic Bravais lattices (simple, body-centered, and face-centered) due to their high symmetry. However, it is not a general rule and fails for lower-symmetry lattices such as hexagonal or monoclinic systems [@problem_id:2790336].

Once a surface plane is defined, its atomic arrangement can be described as a two-dimensional **Bravais lattice** or **net**. A 2D Bravais lattice is an infinite array of points generated by integer linear combinations of two linearly independent primitive translation vectors, $\mathbf{a}_1$ and $\mathbf{a}_2$:
$$ \mathcal{L} = \{ \mathbf{R} = n_1 \mathbf{a}_1 + n_2 \mathbf{a}_2 \mid n_1, n_2 \in \mathbb{Z} \} $$
Based on their point group symmetries, there are exactly five distinct 2D Bravais nets: **oblique**, **primitive rectangular**, **centered rectangular**, **square**, and **hexagonal** (also called triangular) [@problem_id:2790331].

The choice of [primitive vectors](@entry_id:142930) $(\mathbf{a}_1, \mathbf{a}_2)$ for a given lattice is not unique. Any pair of vectors $(\mathbf{a}'_1, \mathbf{a}'_2)$ that also generates the same lattice is also a valid primitive basis. Such a [change of basis](@entry_id:145142) can be represented by a [matrix transformation](@entry_id:151622) $(\mathbf{a}'_1, \mathbf{a}'_2) = (\mathbf{a}_1, \mathbf{a}_2) \mathbf{M}$, where $\mathbf{M}$ is a $2 \times 2$ matrix with integer entries. For the new basis to be primitive, the area of its unit cell must be the same as the original, which requires the determinant of the transformation matrix to be $\det(\mathbf{M}) = \pm 1$. Such matrices form the group $\mathrm{GL}(2, \mathbb{Z})$. While the shape of the unit cell may change under such a transformation, the underlying lattice of points and its density are preserved [@problem_id:2790331].

### Commensurate Superstructures and Matrix Notation

Real surfaces often exhibit periodicities different from the ideal bulk termination. This can be due to the reconstruction of the substrate atoms to minimize [surface energy](@entry_id:161228) or the ordered [adsorption](@entry_id:143659) of foreign atoms (an overlayer). If the new surface lattice, or **superlattice**, is rationally related to the substrate lattice, it is termed **commensurate**. This means that a periodic **Coincidence Site Lattice (CSL)** exists, which is the set of points common to both the substrate and overlayer lattices, forming a super-[periodicity](@entry_id:152486). If the [lattices](@entry_id:265277) are not rationally related, they are **incommensurate**, and no such long-range periodic coincidence exists [@problem_id:2790318].

The most general and rigorous method for describing a commensurate superstructure is the **[transformation matrix](@entry_id:151616) notation**. Let the [primitive vectors](@entry_id:142930) of the substrate be $(\mathbf{a}_1, \mathbf{a}_2)$ and those of the overlayer be $(\mathbf{s}_1, \mathbf{s}_2)$. For a commensurate structure, the overlayer vectors can be expressed as integer [linear combinations](@entry_id:154743) of the substrate vectors:
$$ \mathbf{s}_1 = m_{11} \mathbf{a}_1 + m_{21} \mathbf{a}_2 $$
$$ \mathbf{s}_2 = m_{12} \mathbf{a}_1 + m_{22} \mathbf{a}_2 $$
This relationship is concisely captured by the [integer matrix](@entry_id:151642) $\mathbf{M}$:
$$ (\mathbf{s}_1, \mathbf{s}_2) = (\mathbf{a}_1, \mathbf{a}_2) \begin{pmatrix} m_{11}  m_{12} \\ m_{21}  m_{22} \end{pmatrix} $$
The determinant of this matrix, $\det(\mathbf{M})$, has a direct physical meaning. Its absolute value, $|\det(\mathbf{M})|$, gives the ratio of the areas of the overlayer and substrate primitive unit cells:
$$ |\det(\mathbf{M})| = \frac{A_{\text{overlayer}}}{A_{\text{substrate}}} $$
Since the [matrix elements](@entry_id:186505) are integers, this ratio must be an integer, signifying that the overlayer unit cell encompasses an integer number of substrate unit cells. The sign of the determinant indicates whether the handedness of the basis is preserved ($\det(\mathbf{M}) > 0$) or reversed ($\det(\mathbf{M})  0$) [@problem_id:2790370].

As an example, consider an overlayer defined by the vectors $\mathbf{s}_1 = 2\mathbf{a}_1 + 1\mathbf{a}_2$ and $\mathbf{s}_2 = -1\mathbf{a}_1 + 3\mathbf{a}_2$. The [transformation matrix](@entry_id:151616) is $\mathbf{M} = \begin{pmatrix} 2  -1 \\ 1  3 \end{pmatrix}$. The determinant is $\det(\mathbf{M}) = (2)(3) - (-1)(1) = 7$. This tells us that the overlayer primitive cell has an area exactly 7 times that of the substrate primitive cell, and its handedness is preserved [@problem_id:2790370].

### Wood's Notation: A Common Shorthand

While the matrix notation is completely general, a simpler and more intuitive shorthand known as **Wood's notation** is widely used, particularly for superstructures whose lattices are aligned with or simply rotated relative to the substrate lattice. This notation is distinct from the 3D Miller indices used to define the overall surface orientation; for example, a `Si(001)-c(2x2)` surface has a macroscopic orientation given by (001) Miller indices and a 2D atomic arrangement described by `c(2x2)` Wood's notation [@problem_id:2790336].

The general form of Wood's notation is $(\frac{|\mathbf{s}_1|}{|\mathbf{a}_1|} \times \frac{|\mathbf{s}_2|}{|\mathbf{a}_2|}) \mathrm{R}\theta^{\circ}$, often simplified to $(m \times n)\mathrm{R}\theta^{\circ}$. Here, $m$ and $n$ are the scaling factors of the overlayer basis vectors relative to the substrate basis vectors, and $\theta$ is the angle of rotation of the overlayer unit cell with respect to the substrate unit cell. The `R` is omitted if $\theta = 0^{\circ}$ [@problem_id:2790354].

A critical element of Wood's notation is the prefix, which can be either `p` (for primitive) or `c` (for centered):
*   **`p(mxn)`**: This denotes a **primitive** superstructure cell. The vectors $\mathbf{s}_1 = m\mathbf{a}_1$ and $\mathbf{s}_2 = n\mathbf{a}_2$ are the [primitive vectors](@entry_id:142930) of the overlayer. The cell contains exactly one lattice point, and its area is $A_{\text{overlayer}} = mn A_{\text{substrate}}$ [@problem_id:2790365].
*   **`c(mxn)`**: This denotes a **centered** superstructure cell. The vectors $\mathbf{s}_1 = m\mathbf{a}_1$ and $\mathbf{s}_2 = n\mathbf{a}_2$ now define a larger, non-primitive *conventional* cell which contains an additional lattice point at its center, $(\mathbf{s}_1 + \mathbf{s}_2)/2$. This [conventional cell](@entry_id:747851) thus contains two lattice points. The true [primitive unit cell](@entry_id:159354) of this centered lattice has half the area of the [conventional cell](@entry_id:747851), so $A_{\text{overlayer-primitive}} = \frac{mn}{2} A_{\text{substrate}}$ [@problem_id:2790365, @problem_id:2790354]. The presence of centering introduces [systematic absences](@entry_id:142990) in the [diffraction pattern](@entry_id:141984), which for a `c`-centered lattice occur for reflections $(h,k)$ where the sum $h+k$ is odd (when indexed in the conventional reciprocal basis) [@problem_id:2790365].

The choice between `p` and `c` notation is sometimes a matter of convention, as the same physical lattice can occasionally be described in multiple ways. A classic example occurs on a square substrate. A superlattice with [primitive vectors](@entry_id:142930) $\mathbf{s}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + \mathbf{a}_2$ and $\mathbf{s}_2 = -\mathbf{a}_1 + \mathbf{a}_2$ can be described either as $p(\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2})\text{R}45^{\circ}$ or, more commonly, as `c(2x2)`. These two notations describe the exact same set of lattice points and are physically equivalent [@problem_id:2790331, @problem_id:2790365].

To convert from the matrix notation $\mathbf{M}$ to Wood's notation for a given structure, one must calculate the lengths of the new basis vectors and the angle between them and the substrate vectors. For a hexagonal substrate with $|\mathbf{s}_1|=|\mathbf{s}_2|=a$ and an angle of $60^{\circ}$ between them, the squared length of a vector $\mathbf{v} = u\mathbf{s}_1 + v\mathbf{s}_2$ is $|\mathbf{v}|^2 = a^2(u^2 + v^2 + uv)$. Given a matrix like $\mathbf{M} = \begin{pmatrix} 2  1 \\ -1  1 \end{pmatrix}$, we find the overlayer vectors $\mathbf{o}_1=2\mathbf{s}_1-\mathbf{s}_2$ and $\mathbf{o}_2=\mathbf{s}_1+\mathbf{s}_2$. Calculating their lengths and the angle between $\mathbf{o}_1$ and $\mathbf{s}_1$ allows for the determination of the Wood's notation parameters $p, q,$ and $\theta$. The area scaling factor is simply $|\det(\mathbf{M})|$ [@problem_id:2790337].

### Applications and Advanced Concepts

#### Surface Coverage

Crystallographic notation is essential for quantifying surface properties, most notably the **adsorbate coverage** ($\Theta$). Coverage is defined as the ratio of the number of adsorbate atoms per unit area to the number of substrate atoms in the top layer per unit area. Assuming one adsorbate per overlayer [primitive cell](@entry_id:136497) and one atom per substrate primitive cell, the coverage simplifies to the inverse ratio of the cell areas:
$$ \Theta = \frac{\sigma_{\text{adsorbate}}}{\sigma_{\text{substrate}}} = \frac{1 / A_{\text{overlayer}}}{1 / A_{\text{substrate}}} = \frac{A_{\text{substrate}}}{A_{\text{overlayer}}} $$
This ratio can be directly determined from the superstructure notation. For example, on an fcc(111) surface, a $(\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3})\text{R}30^{\circ}$ overlayer has an area 3 times that of the substrate, so $\Theta = 1/3$. A `(2x2)` overlayer has an area 4 times larger, giving $\Theta = 1/4$ [@problem_id:2790342].

#### Surface Reconstruction

The formation of a new surface periodicity is not limited to the addition of adsorbates. The substrate atoms themselves can rearrange to lower their energy, a process called **[surface reconstruction](@entry_id:145120)**. Wood's notation and matrix notation are equally applicable to describing the geometry of reconstructions. For example, the clean Si(001) surface is famously reconstructed. Experimental techniques like Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) and Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) show a periodicity that is doubled in one direction, described as `(2x1)`. A key feature that identifies this as a reconstruction is the observation that the orientation of the rows of atoms rotates by $90^{\circ}$ across single atomic steps. This behavior is a direct consequence of the underlying diamond-cubic bulk structure and would not be expected for a simple adsorbate layer. The notation `Si(001)-(2x1)` thus describes the geometry of this reconstructed surface relative to the ideal bulk-terminated `(1x1)` surface [@problem_id:2790367].

#### Vicinal Surfaces

A superstructure can also arise from macroscopic geometry. A **vicinal surface** is one that is intentionally cut at a small miscut angle $\theta$ from a low-index crystallographic plane. To minimize [surface energy](@entry_id:161228), such a surface spontaneously forms a "staircase" of atomically flat terraces of the low-index orientation, separated by a periodic array of atomic steps. The terrace width $W$, step height $h$, and miscut angle $\theta$ are related by the exact geometric formula $\tan\theta = h/W$. This regular array of steps imposes a new, long-range periodicity on the surface. If the terraces have width $W = ma$, where $a$ is the substrate lattice constant and $m$ is an integer, this corresponds to a `(mx1)` or `(1xm)` superstructure, which can be described using Wood's notation [@problem_id:2790361].

#### Symmetry Domains

When an overlayer with a certain symmetry is placed on a substrate with higher symmetry, multiple equivalent orientations of the overlayer can form, known as **symmetry domains**. These domains are related to each other by the [symmetry operations](@entry_id:143398) of the substrate that are *not* also [symmetry operations](@entry_id:143398) of the overlayer. **Rotational domains** are related by a rotation operation of the substrate, while **mirror domains** are related by a reflection. The number of possible domains can be predicted using group theory. For an overlayer with [point group symmetry](@entry_id:141230) $G_O$ on a substrate with [point group symmetry](@entry_id:141230) $G_S$, the number of distinct domains is given by the ratio of the group orders: $N = |G_S| / |G_S \cap G_O|$.

For example, the fcc(111) surface has $C_{3v}$ symmetry (order 6, with 3-fold rotation and 3 vertical mirror planes). An overlayer with no [internal symmetry](@entry_id:168727) ($G_O = C_1$, order 1) placed in a general orientation will have an intersection group of only the identity, $G_S \cap G_O = \{E\}$. The number of expected domains is therefore $6/1 = 6$. These correspond to three rotational domains (at $0^\circ, 120^\circ, 240^\circ$) and their three distinct mirror images. If the overlayer happens to be aligned with a substrate [mirror plane](@entry_id:148117), that mirror operation becomes a shared symmetry element. The intersection group becomes larger (order 2), and the number of distinct domains reduces to $6/2 = 3$ [@problem_id:2790326]. The observation of these domains in techniques like STM provides direct insight into the symmetry relationship between the surface and the overlayer.
