The analysis begins with the principle of virtual work, which establishes the work-conjugate pairs of kinematic and static quantities at the boundary of the plate.\n\nThe variation of the total potential energy, $\\delta \\Pi = \\delta U - \\delta W_{ext}$, must be zero for equilibrium, where $U$ is the strain energy and $W_{ext}$ is the work done by external loads. For a Kirchhoff–Love plate, applying the divergence theorem (or Green's identities) to the variation of the strain energy, $\\delta U$, isolates terms in the domain $\\Omega$ and on the boundary $\\partial \\Omega$. The boundary integral term, representing the virtual work done by the internal stress resultants at the edge, takes the form:\n$$ \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\left( M_n \\delta\\left(\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial n}\\right) - Q_n \\delta w \\right) ds $$\nwhere terms at corners have been omitted as we consider a smooth edge segment. In this expression, $\\delta(\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial n})$ is the virtual rotation of the edge about the tangent vector $\\boldsymbol{s}$ and $\\delta w$ is the virtual transverse displacement of the edge. The quantities $M_n$ and $Q_n$ are the work-conjugates to these virtual kinematic changes. Specifically, $M_n$ is the normal bending moment and $Q_n$ is the Kirchhoff effective shear force, which is the generalized transverse shear traction mentioned in the problem statement.\n\nThe fundamental principle for specifying boundary conditions is that at each point on the boundary, for each work-conjugate pair, one and only one quantity must be prescribed. The two essential work-conjugate pairs are:\n1.  Normal slope (kinematic) $\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial n}$ and Normal bending moment (static) $M_n$.\n2.  Transverse deflection (kinematic) $w$ and Kirchhoff effective shear force (static) $Q_n$.\n\nWe now analyze the three classical boundary types based on this principle.\n\n**Clamped Edge:**\nA clamped edge is physically constrained against both translation and rotation. This means the kinematic quantities are prescribed to be zero.\n-   The edge cannot deflect: $w = 0$.\n-   The edge cannot rotate, so its slope must remain zero (assuming it was initially flat and horizontal): $\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial n} = 0$.\nSince the kinematic quantities ($w$ and $\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial n}$) are prescribed, the corresponding static quantities ($Q_n$ and $M_n$) become reaction forces and moments, which are generally non-zero and determined by the solution. The conditions are $w=0$ and $\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial n}=0$.\n\n**Simply Supported Edge:**\nA simply supported edge (or hinged edge) is constrained against translation but is free to rotate.\n-   The edge cannot deflect: $w = 0$. This is a prescribed kinematic condition.\n-   The edge is free to rotate about an axis tangential to the edge. Freedom to rotate implies that there is no resisting moment. Therefore, the normal bending moment must be zero: $M_n = 0$. This is a prescribed static condition.\nThe conditions are a mixture: one kinematic ($w=0$) and one static ($M_n=0$).\n\n**Free Edge:**\nA free edge is not subjected to any external supports or loads. Therefore, all stress resultants (static quantities) must vanish along this edge.\n-   There is no applied bending moment: $M_n = 0$.\n-   There is no applied transverse force: $Q_n = 0$.\nSince the static quantities ($M_n$ and $Q_n$) are prescribed, the corresponding kinematic quantities ($w$ and $\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial n}$) are unknown and must be found as part of the solution.

The conditions for a clamped edge are $w=0$ and $\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial n}=0$. The conditions for a free edge are $M_n=0$ and $Q_n=0$.

However, for a simply supported edge, the condition is $M_n=0$, not $Q_n=0$. The effective shear force $Q_n$ is a reaction force and is generally non-zero.
