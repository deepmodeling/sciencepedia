The question asks for a derivation and analysis, which is a standard procedure in physical metallurgy and materials thermodynamics. The problem is neither trivial nor ill-posed.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe thermodynamic equilibrium for solute segregation is governed by the equality of the chemical potential of the solute species $B$ in the bulk ($\\mu_B^\\text{bulk}$) and at the grain boundary ($\\mu_B^\\text{GB}$).\n$$ \\mu_B^\\text{bulk} = \\mu_B^\\text{GB} $$\nUnder the assumption of ideal mixing in the dilute bulk and on the grain boundary sites (Langmuir-McLean model), the chemical potentials are expressed as:\n$$ \\mu_B^\\text{bulk} = \\mu_B^{0, \\text{bulk}}(T, p) + k_B T \\ln X_B^\\text{bulk} $$\n$$ \\mu_B^\\text{GB} = \\mu_B^{0, \\text{GB}}(T, p) + k_B T \\ln \\left( \\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta} \\right) $$\nHere, $\\mu_B^{0, \\text{bulk}}(T, p)$ and $\\mu_B^{0, \\text{GB}}(T, p)$ are the standard state chemical potentials of a solute atom in the bulk and at the grain boundary, respectively, at temperature $T$ and pressure $p$. $X_B^\\text{bulk}$ is the bulk mole fraction of the solute, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $\\theta$ is the fractional occupancy of grain boundary sites. The term $\\ln(\\theta/(1-\\theta))$ arises from the configurational entropy of mixing on the grain boundary sites.\n\nEquating the chemical potentials and rearranging yields the segregation isotherm:\n$$ k_B T \\ln \\left( \\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta} \\right) = \\mu_B^{0, \\text{bulk}}(T, p) - \\mu_B^{0, \\text{GB}}(T, p) + k_B T \\ln X_B^\\text{bulk} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta} = X_B^\\text{bulk} \\exp \\left( - \\frac{\\mu_B^{0, \\text{GB}}(T, p) - \\mu_B^{0, \\text{bulk}}(T, p)}{k_B T} \\right) $$\nThe term in the exponent numerand is the standard Gibbs free energy of segregation at pressure $p$. We are tasked to find the *effective* segregation free energy, which is precisely this quantity:\n$$ \\Delta G_\\text{seg}^\\text{eff} \\equiv \\mu_B^{0, \\text{GB}}(T, p) - \\mu_B^{0, \\text{bulk}}(T, p) $$\nTo find the pressure dependence of this term, we use the provided fundamental relation $(\\partial G/\\partial p)_T = V$. For a single particle, this becomes $(\\partial \\mu/\\partial p)_T = v$, where $v$ is the partial volume of the species. Thus:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\Delta G_\\text{seg}^\\text{eff}}{\\partial p} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} \\left( \\mu_B^{0, \\text{GB}}(T, p) - \\mu_B^{0, \\text{bulk}}(T, p) \\right) = v_B^\\text{GB} - v_B^\\text{bulk} $$\nwhere $v_B^\\text{GB}$ and $v_B^\\text{bulk}$ are the partial volumes of a solute atom at a grain boundary site and a bulk site, respectively. The term $v_B^\\text{GB} - v_B^\\text{bulk}$ is the change in system volume when one solute atom is moved from the bulk to the grain boundary.\n\nThe problem defines $\\Delta V \\equiv V_\\text{initial} - V_\\text{final}$. This corresponds to the reduction in volume. The change in volume is $V_\\text{final} - V_\\text{initial}$, which is equal to $v_B^\\text{GB} - v_B^\\text{bulk}$. Therefore, we have the relation:\n$$ v_B^\\text{GB} - v_B^\\text{bulk} = -(V_\\text{initial} - V_\\text{final}) = -\\Delta V $$\nSubstituting this into the derivative gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\Delta G_\\text{seg}^\\text{eff}}{\\partial p} = -\\Delta V $$\nTo find $\\Delta G_\\text{seg}^\\text{eff}$ at a pressure $p$, we integrate from $p=0$ to $p$, assuming $\\Delta V$ is constant with respect to pressure, which is consistent with the problem's simplifications.\n$$ \\int_{\\Delta G_\\text{seg}(0)}^{\\Delta G_\\text{seg}^\\text{eff}(p)} dG = \\int_{0}^{p} (-\\Delta V) dp' $$\n$$ \\Delta G_\\text{seg}^\\text{eff}(p) - \\Delta G_\\text{seg}(0) = -p\\Delta V $$\nThe problem defines $\\Delta G_\\text{seg}$ as the segregation free energy at $p=0$, so $\\Delta G_\\text{seg}(0) = \\Delta G_\\text{seg}$. The final expression is:\n$$ \\Delta G_\\text{seg}^\\text{eff} = \\Delta G_\\text{seg} - p\\Delta V $$\nNow we analyze the behavior of the equilibrium coverage $\\theta$ for the case $\\Delta V0$. The segregation isotherm is:\n$$ \\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta} = X_B^\\text{bulk} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_\\text{seg} - p\\Delta V}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nSegregation is enhanced (i.e., $\\theta$ increases) when the exponent becomes more positive, which means $\\Delta G_\\text{seg}^\\text{eff}$ becomes more negative (or simply smaller, as segregation is typically spontaneous, $\\Delta G_\\text{seg}  0$).\n\n1.  **Compression ($p0$):**\n    With $p0$ and $\\Delta V0$, the term $-p\\Delta V$ is negative.\n    Therefore, $\\Delta G_\\text{seg}^\\text{eff} = \\Delta G_\\text{seg} - p\\Delta V  \\Delta G_\\text{seg}$. The effective segregation free energy is lowered (becomes more negative).\n    This makes segregation thermodynamically more favorable. Consequently, the right-hand side of the isotherm equation increases, which implies that $\\theta$ **increases**. This is consistent with Le Chatelier's principle: applying pressure favors the state with smaller volume, which is the segregated state when $\\Delta V0$.\n\n2.  **Tension ($p0$):**\n    With $p0$ and $\\Delta V0$, the term $-p\\Delta V$ is positive.\n    Therefore, $\\Delta G_\\text{seg}^\\text{eff} = \\Delta G_\\text{seg} - p\\Delta V  \\Delta G_\\text{seg}$. The effective segregation free energy is raised (becomes less negative).\n    This makes segregation thermodynamically less favorable. Consequently, the right-hand side of the isotherm equation decreases, which implies that $\\theta$ **decreases**. This is also consistent with Le Chatelier's principle: applying tension (reducing pressure) favors the state with larger volume, which is the unsegregated (bulk) state.\n\nIn summary, the derived expression is $\\Delta G_\\text{seg}^\\text{eff} = \\Delta G_\\text{seg} - p\\Delta V$.

This requires deriving an expression for the work of separation, $W_{\\text{sep}}(\\theta, c_b, T)$, as a function of misorientation angle $\\theta$, bulk solute concentration $c_b$, and temperature $T$.\n\nFirst, we determine the effect of solute segregation on the interfacial free energies, $\\gamma_s$ and $\\gamma_{\\text{gb}}$, to first order in $c_b$. According to the Gibbs adsorption equation, at a constant temperature $T$, the change in interfacial free energy $\\gamma_i$ for an interface $i$ is given by $\\mathrm{d}\\gamma_i = -\\Gamma_i \\mathrm{d}\\mu$, where $\\Gamma_i$ is the interfacial excess of the solute and $\\mu$ is its chemical potential. For a dilute ideal solution, the chemical potential is $\\mu = \\mu^0 + k_B T \\ln c_b$, where $\\mu^0$ is a standard state potential and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. The differential of the chemical potential is $\\mathrm{d}\\mu = k_B T \\frac{\\mathrm{d}c_b}{c_b}$. Substituting this into the Gibbs equation yields the derivative of the interfacial energy with respect to bulk concentration:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\gamma_i}{\\mathrm{d}c_b} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\gamma_i}{\\mathrm{d}\\mu} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mu}{\\mathrm{d}c_b} = -\\Gamma_i \\left( \\frac{k_B T}{c_b} \\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that in the Henry's law limit of the Langmuir–McLean isotherm, the interfacial excess is $\\Gamma_i \\approx N_i K_i c_b$, where $N_i$ is the areal density of segregation sites and $K_i$ is the segregation equilibrium constant. Substituting this approximation for $\\Gamma_i$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\gamma_i}{\\mathrm{d}c_b} \\approx -(N_i K_i c_b) \\left( \\frac{k_B T}{c_b} \\right) = -N_i K_i k_B T\n$$\nSince this derivative is constant in the dilute limit, we can integrate from a solute-free state ($c_b=0$, energy $\\gamma_i^0$) to a state with concentration $c_b$ to find the first-order change:\n$$\n\\gamma_i(c_b) - \\gamma_i^0 = \\int_{0}^{c_b} (-N_i K_i k_B T) \\mathrm{d}c'_b = -N_i K_i k_B T c_b\n$$\nThus, the interfacial free energies for the free surface ($i=s$) and grain boundary ($i=\\text{gb}$) are, to first order in $c_b$:\n$$\n\\gamma_s(c_b, T) \\approx \\gamma_s^0 - N_s K_s k_B T c_b\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\text{gb}}(\\theta, c_b, T) \\approx \\gamma_{\\text{gb}}^0(\\theta) - N_{\\text{gb}} K_{\\text{gb}} k_B T c_b\n$$\nThe work of separation is defined as $W_{\\text{sep}}(\\theta, c_b, T) = 2\\gamma_s(c_b, T) - \\gamma_{\\text{gb}}(\\theta, c_b, T)$. Substituting the above expressions:\n$$\nW_{\\text{sep}}(\\theta, c_b, T) \\approx 2(\\gamma_s^0 - N_s K_s k_B T c_b) - (\\gamma_{\\text{gb}}^0(\\theta) - N_{\\text{gb}} K_{\\text{gb}} k_B T c_b)\n$$\n$$\nW_{\\text{sep}}(\\theta, c_b, T) \\approx (2\\gamma_s^0 - \\gamma_{\\text{gb}}^0(\\theta)) - (2N_s K_s - N_{\\text{gb}} K_{\\text{gb}}) k_B T c_b\n$$\nThe first term is the work of separation in the solute-free state, $W_{\\text{sep}}^0(\\theta) = 2\\gamma_s^0 - \\gamma_{\\text{gb}}^0(\\theta)$.\n\nWe can now compute the two components of the reduction factor $R$.\nThe denominator is $W_{\\text{sep}}(\\theta_0, 0, T) = W_{\\text{sep}}^0(\\theta_0)$. Using the given Read–Shockley form for the solute-free grain boundary energy, $\\gamma_{\\text{gb}}^0(\\theta) = A\\theta[1-\\ln(\\theta/\\theta_m)]$:\n$$\nW_{\\text{sep}}(\\theta_0, 0, T) = 2\\gamma_s^0 - A\\theta_0\\left[1-\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta_0}{\\theta_m}\\right)\\right]\n$$\nThe numerator is $W_{\\text{sep}}(\\theta_1, c_b, T)$, given by:\n$$\nW_{\\text{sep}}(\\theta_1, c_b, T) \\approx \\left(2\\gamma_s^0 - A\\theta_1\\left[1-\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta_1}{\\theta_m}\\right)\\right]\\right) - (2N_s K_s - N_{\\text{gb}} K_{\\text{gb}}) k_B T c_b\n$$\nThe segregation constants are $K_s = \\exp(-\\Delta G_s/(k_B T))$ and $K_{\\text{gb}} = \\exp(-\\Delta G_{\\text{gb}}/(k_B T))$.\n\nWe now substitute the provided numerical values:\n$\\theta_0 = 0.05$ rad, $\\theta_1 = 0.20$ rad, $T = 1000$ K, $c_b = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}$, $\\gamma_s^0 = 1.80$ J/m$^2$, $A = 0.50$ J/m$^2$, $\\theta_m = 0.30$ rad, $N_s = 1.0 \\times 10^{19}$ m$^{-2}$, $N_{\\text{gb}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{18}$ m$^{-2}$, $\\Delta G_s = -0.50$ eV, $\\Delta G_{\\text{gb}} = -0.30$ eV, $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K, and $1$ eV $= 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}$ J.\n\nThe thermal energy is $k_B T = (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K}) \\times (1000 \\text{ K}) = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-20}$ J.\nConvert segregation energies to Joules:\n$\\Delta G_s = -0.50 \\text{ eV} \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J/eV}) = -8.010883 \\times 10^{-20}$ J.\n$\\Delta G_{\\text{gb}} = -0.30 \\text{ eV} \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J/eV}) = -4.806530 \\times 10^{-20}$ J.\nCalculate the dimensionless arguments for the segregation constants:\n$-\\frac{\\Delta G_s}{k_B T} = \\frac{8.010883 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}}{1.380649 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}} \\approx 5.80233$\n$-\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\text{gb}}}{k_B T} = \\frac{4.806530 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}}{1.380649 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}} \\approx 3.48140$\nThe segregation constants are:\n$K_s = \\exp(5.80233) \\approx 331.064$\n$K_{\\text{gb}} = \\exp(3.48140) \\approx 32.5034$\n\nCalculate the denominator, $W_{\\text{denom}} = W_{\\text{sep}}(\\theta_0, 0, T)$:\n$\\gamma_{\\text{gb}}^0(\\theta_0) = (0.50) (0.05) \\left[1 - \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.05}{0.30}\\right)\\right] = 0.025 [1 + \\ln(6)] \\approx 0.069794$ J/m$^2$.\n$W_{\\text{denom}} = 2(1.80) - 0.069794 = 3.530206$ J/m$^2$.\n\nCalculate the numerator, $W_{\\text{num}} = W_{\\text{sep}}(\\theta_1, c_b, T)$:\nFirst, the solute-free work of separation at $\\theta_1$:\n$\\gamma_{\\text{gb}}^0(\\theta_1) = (0.50) (0.20) \\left[1 - \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.20}{0.30}\\right)\\right] = 0.1 [1 + \\ln(1.5)] \\approx 0.140547$ J/m$^2$.\n$W_{\\text{sep}}^0(\\theta_1) = 2(1.80) - 0.140547 = 3.459453$ J/m$^2$.\nNext, the solute correction term, $\\Delta W = (2N_s K_s - N_{\\text{gb}} K_{\\text{gb}}) k_B T c_b$:\n$2N_s K_s = 2 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{19} \\text{ m}^{-2}) \\times 331.064 = 6.62128 \\times 10^{21}$ m$^{-2}$.\n$N_{\\text{gb}} K_{\\text{gb}} = (5.0 \\times 10^{18} \\text{ m}^{-2}) \\times 32.5034 = 1.62517 \\times 10^{20}$ m$^{-2}$.\n$2N_s K_s - N_{\\text{gb}} K_{\\text{gb}} = (66.2128 - 1.62517) \\times 10^{20} = 6.458763 \\times 10^{21}$ m$^{-2}$.\n$\\Delta W = (6.458763 \\times 10^{21}) \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-20}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-5}) \\approx 0.00089172$ J/m$^2$.\n$W_{\\text{num}} = W_{\\text{sep}}^0(\\theta_1) - \\Delta W = 3.459453 - 0.00089172 = 3.458561$ J/m$^2$.\n\nFinally, compute the reduction factor $R$:\n$R = \\sqrt{\\frac{W_{\\text{num}}}{W_{\\text{denom}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3.458561}{3.530206}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.9796915} \\approx 0.9897936$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures yields $0.9898$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.9898}\n$$", "id": "2786381"}]}
