This exercise challenges you to correctly define the conditions for plane stress and plane strain, two foundational concepts in continuum mechanics, and to justify when each is appropriate for modeling an SEI layer based on its geometry and boundary conditions [@problem_id:2778449]. Mastering these approximations is a crucial first step for any rigorous analysis of thin-film systems.", "problem": "A Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) coating of thickness $h$ is perfectly bonded to an elastic substrate that is much thicker, with substrate thickness $H_{s}$ satisfying $H_{s} \\gg h$. The SEI has a characteristic in-plane length scale of variation $L$ (for example, a half-width to a free edge, a misfit-eigenstrain wavelength, or the radius of curvature of a surface feature) and an out-of-plane extent $B$ along a direction of translational invariance (for example, the length of a straight feature into the page). Assume linear elasticity and small strains. Consider two-dimensional reductions of three-dimensional elasticity frequently used in nanomechanics: plane stress and plane strain.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions of the Cauchy stress tensor and small-strain tensor, and the boundary condition that the SEI’s top surface is traction-free (no externally applied normal or shear traction) while the SEI is coherently bonded at its bottom to the thick substrate, identify which statement correctly defines plane stress versus plane strain for the SEI and states when each assumption is asymptotically appropriate in terms of $h$, $L$, and $B$.\n\nA. Plane stress in the SEI means $\\sigma_{zz} \\approx \\sigma_{xz} \\approx \\sigma_{yz} \\approx 0$ throughout the SEI, which holds when $h/L \\to 0$ because the traction-free top surface enforces negligible through-thickness tractions and Saint-Venant’s principle suppresses $\\sigma_{zz}$ in the interior by a factor that scales as $\\mathcal{O}(h/L)$.

Plane stress in the SEI can only be justified if the substrate is extremely soft so that $\\sigma_{zz}$ can relax, independent of $h/L$, whereas plane strain is the correct description for a thin SEI on a thick substrate because bonding to a rigid substrate clamps the out-of-plane normal strain $\\epsilon_{zz}$ to zero across the SEI thickness.", "solution": "The problem statement is a valid exercise in the application of two-dimensional approximations in linear elasticity to thin film mechanics. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We may proceed to the solution.\n\nLet us establish a coordinate system. Let the SEI film occupy the region $0 \\le z \\le h$. The in-plane coordinates are $x$ and $y$. The problem implies a two-dimensional reduction where the physics is primarily considered in the $x$-$z$ plane. This is achieved by assuming translational invariance in the $y$ direction, which is described as the \"out-of-plane\" direction with extent $B$. The \"in-plane length scale of variation\" $L$ thus refers to variations in the $x$ direction. The substrate is located at $z  0$.\n\nThe fundamental definitions are:\n1.  The Cauchy stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, with components $\\sigma_{ij}$.\n2.  The small-strain tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$, with components $\\epsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_j u_i + \\partial_i u_j)$, where $\\mathbf{u}$ is the displacement vector.\n3.  The constitutive relation for a linear elastic isotropic material (Hooke's Law): $\\sigma_{ij} = \\frac{E}{1+\\nu}\\left(\\epsilon_{ij} + \\frac{\\nu}{1-2\\nu}\\epsilon_{kk}\\delta_{ij}\\right)$, where $E$ is Young's modulus and $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio.\n4.  The equations of equilibrium (in the absence of body forces): $\\sigma_{ij,j} = 0$.\n\nThe boundary conditions on the SEI are:\n1.  Traction-free top surface at $z=h$. The traction vector is $\\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$, where $\\mathbf{n}=(0,0,1)$ is the outward normal. This implies $\\sigma_{zx}(z=h) = 0$, $\\sigma_{zy}(z=h) = 0$, and $\\sigma_{zz}(z=h) = 0$.\n2.  Coherent bonding to the substrate at $z=0$. This implies continuity of displacement at the interface.\n\nNow, we analyze the two-dimensional approximations.\n\n**Plane Stress**\nThe state of plane stress is defined by the assumption that the stress components acting on a particular plane are zero. For a thin plate or film in the $x$-$y$ plane, this is conventionally $\\sigma_{zz}=\\sigma_{xz}=\\sigma_{yz}=0$. In our problem, the thin dimension is $z$, so this approximation corresponds to assuming $\\sigma_{zz} \\approx 0$, $\\sigma_{xz} \\approx 0$, and $\\sigma_{yz} \\approx 0$ throughout the film thickness $h$.\n\nLet us justify this approximation. We consider the equilibrium equation in the $z$-direction:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{zx}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{zy}}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{zz}}{\\partial z} = 0 $$\nAssuming the problem is primarily two-dimensional in the $x$-$z$ plane (approaching translational invariance in $y$), we have $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\approx 0$, simplifying the equation to $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{zz}}{\\partial z} \\approx -\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{zx}}{\\partial x}$.\nIntegrating this from a point $z$ within the film to the top surface $z=h$:\n$$ \\int_z^h \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{zz}}{\\partial \\zeta} d\\zeta = \\sigma_{zz}(h) - \\sigma_{zz}(z) \\approx -\\int_z^h \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{zx}}{\\partial x} d\\zeta $$\nUsing the traction-free boundary condition $\\sigma_{zz}(h)=0$, we find the stress inside the film:\n$$ \\sigma_{zz}(z) \\approx \\int_z^h \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{zx}}{\\partial x} d\\zeta $$\nTo estimate the magnitude, we must first estimate $\\sigma_{zx}$. From the equilibrium equation in the $x$-direction, $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{xx}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{xy}}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{xz}}{\\partial z} = 0$, which simplifies to $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{xz}}{\\partial z} \\approx -\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{xx}}{\\partial x}$. Integrating from $z$ to $h$ and using $\\sigma_{xz}(h)=0$:\n$$ \\sigma_{xz}(z) \\approx \\int_z^h \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{xx}}{\\partial x} d\\zeta $$\nThe characteristic scale of in-plane stress variation is $\\frac{|\\sigma_{xx}|_{\\text{char}}}{L}$. Thus, $|\\sigma_{xz}| \\sim (h-z) \\frac{|\\sigma_{xx}|_{\\text{char}}}{L}$. The maximum shear stress is of order $|\\sigma_{xz}|_{\\text{max}} \\sim \\frac{h}{L} |\\sigma_{xx}|_{\\text{char}}$.\nNow substituting this back into the expression for $\\sigma_{zz}$: $|\\sigma_{zz}| \\sim (h-z) \\frac{|\\sigma_{xz}|_{\\text{char}}}{L} \\sim h \\frac{(h/L)|\\sigma_{xx}|_{\\text{char}}}{L} = \\left(\\frac{h}{L}\\right)^2 |\\sigma_{xx}|_{\\text{char}}$.\nTherefore, the ratios of the out-of-plane stresses to the in-plane stresses are $|\\sigma_{xz}|/|\\sigma_{xx}| \\sim \\mathcal{O}(h/L)$ and $|\\sigma_{zz}|/|\\sigma_{xx}| \\sim \\mathcal{O}((h/L)^2)$.\nThe plane stress approximation is thus valid in the asymptotic limit $h/L \\to 0$. The physical basis is Saint-Venant's principle: the effect of the zero-traction boundary condition at $z=h$ ensures that stresses cannot build up significantly through the thickness if the thickness $h$ is much smaller than the in-plane length scale $L$ over which stresses vary.\n\n**Plane Strain**\nThe state of plane strain is a kinematic constraint. For a problem considered in the $x$-$z$ plane, it is defined by the assumption that there is no strain in the out-of-plane ($y$) direction: $\\epsilon_{yy}=0$, and additionally $\\epsilon_{xy}=0$ and $\\epsilon_{yz}=0$. This corresponds physically to a situation where every $x$-$z$ plane deforms identically and the displacement in the $y$-direction is constant, i.e., $u_y = \\text{const}$.\nThis approximation is appropriate for a body that is very long in the $y$-direction (i.e., its extent $B$ is much larger than the characteristic dimensions of the cross-section, $B \\gg L$ and $B \\gg h$) and is constrained from expanding or contracting freely in that direction. For a long body, the material in the central portion is geometrically constrained by the surrounding material, preventing strain in the long direction. The effects of the boundary conditions at the ends (e.g., at $y=\\pm B/2$) decay into the interior over a length scale on the order of the cross-section size, which is dominated by $L$. Therefore, if $B \\gg L$, the plane strain condition holds for the majority of the body's length.\nIn a state of plane strain, the out-of-plane stress $\\sigma_{yy}$ is not zero. From Hooke's law: $\\sigma_{yy} = \\nu(\\sigma_{xx}+\\sigma_{zz})$.\n\n**Invalidity of Plane Strain in the Thickness Direction**\nCould the condition $\\epsilon_{zz} \\approx 0$ hold for the SEI? This would be a state of plane strain in the thickness direction. For this to occur, the film would need to be constrained at both its top ($z=h$) and bottom ($z=0$) surfaces against displacement in the $z$-direction. However, the problem explicitly states the top surface $z=h$ is traction-free, meaning it is free to move. In-plane stresses $\\sigma_{xx}$ and $\\sigma_{yy}$ will induce a Poisson strain $\\epsilon_{zz} = \\frac{1}{E}[\\sigma_{zz} - \\nu(\\sigma_{xx}+\\sigma_{yy})]$. Even if $\\sigma_{zz} \\approx 0$ (plane stress), $\\epsilon_{zz} \\approx -\\frac{\\nu}{E}(\\sigma_{xx}+\\sigma_{yy})$, which is generally non-zero. Thus, the assumption of $\\epsilon_{zz} \\approx 0$ is physically incorrect for this configuration.\n\nNow we evaluate each option:\n\n**A.** \"Plane stress in the SEI means $\\sigma_{zz} \\approx \\sigma_{xz} \\approx \\sigma_{yz} \\approx 0$ throughout the SEI, which holds when $h/L \\to 0$ because the traction-free top surface enforces negligible through-thickness tractions and Saint-Venant’s principle suppresses $\\sigma_{zz}$ in the interior by a factor that scales as $\\mathcal{O}(h/L)$. Plane strain refers to the kinematic constraint $\\epsilon_{yy} \\approx 0$ (with $y$ the out-of-plane invariant direction) and is appropriate in the interior of a configuration with $B \\gg L$ when end constraints prevent net contraction or extension in $y$, so that end effects decay over distances $\\sim L$. Plane strain is not appropriate in the SEI’s thickness direction $z$ because the top surface is traction-free.\"\nThis statement is almost entirely correct. The definition of plane stress, the condition $h/L \\to 0$, and the reasoning involving the free surface and Saint-Venant's principle are all correct. The definition of plane strain and its justification $B \\gg L$ are also correct. The final point about plane strain in the $z$ direction being inappropriate is correct as well. The only minor imprecision is the scaling factor for $\\sigma_{zz}$ being stated as $\\mathcal{O}(h/L)$; a more precise derivation shows it scales as $\\mathcal{O}((h/L)^2)$. However, the core principle of suppression by a factor of the small aspect ratio is correctly stated. Compared to the other options, this is the most accurate description.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.** \"Plane stress in the SEI means $\\epsilon_{zz} \\approx 0$...\" This is an incorrect definition. Plane stress is a condition on stress components, not strain. This confuses it with plane strain in the $z$-direction. \"...while plane strain means $\\sigma_{yy} \\approx 0$...\" This is also an incorrect definition; it is the definition of plane stress. In plane strain, $\\sigma_{yy}$ is generally non-zero. \"The thick substrate implies that plane strain in the thickness direction $z$ is generally valid for the SEI.\" This is incorrect; the free top surface makes this assumption invalid.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** \"Plane stress... requires $h \\gg L$...\" This is the opposite of the correct condition. The plane stress approximation is valid for thin structures, $h \\ll L$, not thick ones. \"...whereas plane strain... is the better assumption when $h \\ll L$...\" This confuses the conditions. The choice between plane stress ($\\sigma_{zz} \\approx 0$) and plane strain ($\\epsilon_{yy} \\approx 0$) for a 2D reduction in the $x-z$ plane depends on the out-of-plane geometry ($B$), not the in-plane aspect ratio ($h/L$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.** \"Plane stress in the SEI can only be justified if the substrate is extremely soft... independent of $h/L$\". This is incorrect. The justification for plane stress is geometric, $h/L \\ll 1$, due to the traction-free surface. It is not primarily dependent on substrate properties. \"...plane strain is the correct description...because bonding to a rigid substrate clamps the out-of-plane normal strain $\\epsilon_{zz}$ to zero...\" This is incorrect on multiple counts. It mistakes the conventional meaning of plane strain (out-of-plane, $\\epsilon_{yy}=0$) for plane strain in the thickness direction ($\\epsilon_{zz}=0$), and it incorrectly claims that bonding to a substrate at $z=0$ clamps the strain throughout a film with a free surface at $z=h$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, Option A is the only statement that presents the physics and definitions correctly, despite a minor imprecision in the order of the scaling factor for $\\sigma_{zz}$. All other options contain fundamental errors in definitions or physical reasoning.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2778449"}, {"introduction": "Once a theoretical framework is established, a key task in nanomechanics is to experimentally quantify the stresses within a material.

Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nWe now proceed to the solution. The relationship between the stress in the thin film and the curvature of the substrate is derived from mechanical equilibrium.\n\nThe intrinsic stress $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{SEI}}$ within the thin film exerts a force per unit width, $F_f$, on the substrate. Assuming the stress is uniform through the film thickness $h_f$, this force is:\n$$F_f = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{SEI}} h_f$$\n\nThis force acts at the mid-plane of the film. Due to the condition $h_f \\ll h_s$, the neutral axis of bending for the composite bilayer can be approximated as the mid-plane of the substrate. The force $F_f$ thus acts at a lever arm distance of approximately $d \\approx \\frac{h_s}{2}$ from this neutral axis. This creates a bending moment per unit width, $M$, applied to the substrate:\n$$M = F_f \\cdot d \\approx (\\sigma_{\\mathrm{SEI}} h_f) \\left(\\frac{h_s}{2}\\right)$$\n\nThis applied moment causes the substrate to bend, and it is counteracted by an internal resisting moment generated by the bending stresses within the substrate itself. For an isotropic plate subjected to equi-biaxial bending, the relationship between the internal bending moment $M$ and the resulting curvature $\\kappa$ is given by classical plate theory:\n$$M = \\mathcal{D} \\kappa$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{D}$ is the flexural rigidity of the plate per unit width. For equi-biaxial conditions, the appropriate flexural rigidity is:\n$$\\mathcal{D} = \\frac{E_s h_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s)}$$\nThe term $M_s = \\frac{E_s}{1-\\nu_s}$ is defined in the problem as the equi-biaxial modulus of the substrate. Using this definition, the flexural rigidity can be written as:\n$$\\mathcal{D} = \\frac{M_s h_s^3}{12}$$\n\nBy equating the applied moment from the film stress to the internal resisting moment of the substrate, we establish the equilibrium condition. We use the measured residual curvature $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{res}}$:\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{SEI}} \\frac{h_f h_s}{2} = \\frac{M_s h_s^3}{12} \\kappa_{\\mathrm{res}}$$\n\nThe problem states the curvature is concave towards the SEI-coated side. By standard convention, this corresponds to a positive curvature, $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{res}}  0$. Such curvature is induced by a compressive stress in the film, meaning $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{SEI}}  0$. The problem asks for the magnitude of the stress, $|\\sigma_{\\mathrm{SEI}}|$. We solve for this quantity:\n$$|\\sigma_{\\mathrm{SEI}}| = \\frac{M_s h_s^3 \\kappa_{\\mathrm{res}}}{12} \\cdot \\frac{2}{h_f h_s}$$\n$$|\\sigma_{\\mathrm{SEI}}| = \\frac{M_s h_s^2}{6 h_f} \\kappa_{\\mathrm{res}}$$\nThis is the well-known Stoney equation for biaxial stress.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into this expression.
