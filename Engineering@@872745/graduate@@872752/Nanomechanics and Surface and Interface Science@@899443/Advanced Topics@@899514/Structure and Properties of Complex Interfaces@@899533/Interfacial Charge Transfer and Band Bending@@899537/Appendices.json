All provided parameters and assumptions are physically reasonable and consistent with established models of metal-semiconductor interfaces modified by self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). The problem asks for a derivation based on fundamental electrostatics and its application to a standard solid-state physics scenario. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the electrostatic potential step across a self-assembled monolayer of polar molecules and the subsequent determination of the vacuum-level shift and the change in the Schottky barrier height.\n\nFirst, we model the SAM as a uniform layer of electric dipoles. The areal molecular density is given as $N_s$, and each molecule has a dipole moment of magnitude $\\mu$ tilted at an angle $\\theta$ from the surface normal. The component of the dipole moment perpendicular to the interface is what contributes to the net potential step. This normal component per molecule is $\\mu_{\\perp} = \\mu \\cos(\\theta)$. The net dipole moment per unit area, which is the surface polarization density $P_s$, is thus given by:\n$$P_s = N_s \\mu_{\\perp} = N_s \\mu \\cos(\\theta)$$\nThis layer of dipoles can be modeled as two parallel sheets of charge, one positive and one negative, separated by the molecular length. A more direct approach, stemming from Gauss's law, relates the potential drop across such a polarized sheet to its surface polarization density.\n\nAccording to the problem, the dipole vector points from the metal (negative charge) towards the semiconductor (positive charge). Let the metal surface be at $z=0$. This orientation means the positive \"charge sheet\" of the dipole layer is on the semiconductor side, and the negative \"charge sheet\" is on the metal side. This creates an electric field, $\\vec{E}$, within the SAM that points from the positive side (semiconductor) to the negative side (metal). The electric field is therefore directed along the negative $z$-axis.\n\nThe electrostatic potential step, $\\Delta V$, across the SAM is defined as the potential on the semiconductor side minus the potential on the metal side, $\\Delta V = V_{\\text{semi}} - V_{\\text{metal}}$. This is related to the electric field by $\\Delta V = - \\int_{\\text{metal}}^{\\text{semi}} \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{l}$. Since $\\vec{E}$ points opposite to the path of integration (from $z=0$ to $z=d_{\\text{SAM}}$), the potential step $\\Delta V$ is positive.\n\nFrom electrostatics, the potential step across a uniform sheet of dipoles in a medium with relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_r$ is given by the Helmholtz equation:\n$$ \\Delta V = \\frac{P_s}{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{N_s \\mu \\cos(\\theta)}{\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r} $$\nwhere $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r$ is the permittivity of the SAM. Since $N_s, \\mu, \\cos(\\theta), \\varepsilon_0, \\varepsilon_r$ are all positive quantities, $\\Delta V > 0$. This confirms that the electrostatic potential is higher on the semiconductor side of the SAM.\n\n1) The first quantity to determine is the vacuum-level shift, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{vac}}$. The vacuum level represents the energy of a stationary free electron. The energy of an electron with charge $-e$ in an electrostatic potential $V$ is $E = -e V$. The shift in the vacuum level energy is therefore related to the electrostatic potential step by:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{vac}} = E_{\\mathrm{vac, semi}} - E_{\\mathrm{vac, metal}} = -e (V_{\\text{semi}} - V_{\\text{metal}}) = -e \\Delta V $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta V$:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{vac}} = -\\frac{e N_s \\mu \\cos(\\theta)}{\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r} $$\nThe problem's sign convention states that a downward shift of the vacuum level corresponds to a negative $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{vac}}$. Since all terms on the right-hand side are positive, we find that $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{vac}}$ is negative, consistent with a downward shift.\n\n2) The second quantity is the change in the Schottky barrier height for electrons, $\\Delta \\Phi_B$. The problem specifies that the Schottky–Mott limit applies. In this limit, the Schottky barrier height for an n-type semiconductor, $\\Phi_{B,n}$, is the difference between the metal work function, $\\Phi_M$, and the semiconductor electron affinity, $\\chi_S$.\nWithout the SAM, the barrier is $\\Phi_{B,0} = \\Phi_M - \\chi_S$.\nThe SAM modifies the metal work function. The work function is the energy required to move an electron from the metal's Fermi level to the vacuum level just outside the surface. The dipole layer shifts this vacuum level by $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{vac}}$. The effective work function of the SAM-coated metal, as seen by the semiconductor, becomes:\n$$ \\Phi_M^{\\text{eff}} = \\Phi_M + \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{vac}} $$\nThe new Schottky barrier height, $\\Phi_{B, \\text{new}}$, is then:\n$$ \\Phi_{B, \\text{new}} = \\Phi_M^{\\text{eff}} - \\chi_S = (\\Phi_M + \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{vac}}) - \\chi_S = (\\Phi_M - \\chi_S) + \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{vac}} = \\Phi_{B,0} + \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{vac}} $$\nThe change in the Schottky barrier height is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta \\Phi_B = \\Phi_{B, \\text{new}} - \\Phi_{B,0} = \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{vac}} $$\nThis shows that the change in the barrier height is identical to the vacuum-level shift. A negative $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{vac}}$ implies a negative $\\Delta \\Phi_B$, which corresponds to a reduction in the barrier height, consistent with the stated sign convention.\n\nTo find the numerical values in electronvolts (eV), we must calculate the magnitude of the potential step $\\Delta V$. The energy shift in eV is numerically equal to the potential step in Volts. From our expression for $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{vac}}$:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{vac}} \\pmod{\\text{in eV}} = \\frac{\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{vac}} \\pmod{\\text{in J}}}{e} = \\frac{1}{e} \\left( -\\frac{e N_s \\mu \\cos(\\theta)}{\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r} \\right) = -\\frac{N_s \\mu \\cos(\\theta)}{\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r} $$\nThus, $\\Delta \\Phi_B \\pmod{\\text{in eV}} = \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{vac}} \\pmod{\\text{in eV}}$.\n\nNow, we substitute the given values:\n$\\mu = 3.00 \\text{ debye} = 3.00 \\times (3.33564 \\times 10^{-30} \\text{ C}\\cdot\\text{m}) = 1.000692 \\times 10^{-29} \\text{ C}\\cdot\\text{m}$\n$N_s = 5.00 \\times 10^{18} \\text{ m}^{-2}$\n$\\theta = 30^{\\circ}$, so $\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n$\\varepsilon_r = 2.5$\n$\\varepsilon_0 = 8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ F}\\cdot\\text{m}^{-1}$\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{vac}} \\pmod{\\text{in eV}} = -\\frac{(5.00 \\times 10^{18} \\text{ m}^{-2}) \\times (1.000692 \\times 10^{-29} \\text{ C}\\cdot\\text{m}) \\times \\cos(30^{\\circ})}{(8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ F}\\cdot\\text{m}^{-1}) \\times 2.5} $$\nNumerator:\n$$ N_s \\mu \\cos(\\theta) = (5.00 \\times 10^{18}) \\times (1.000692 \\times 10^{-29}) \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 4.33314 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ C}\\cdot\\text{m}^{-1} $$\nDenominator:\n$$ \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r = (8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12}) \\times 2.5 \\approx 2.21355 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ F}\\cdot\\text{m}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{vac}} \\pmod{\\text{in eV}} \\approx -\\frac{4.33314 \\times 10^{-11}}{2.21355 \\times 10^{-11}} \\approx -1.9575... $$\nThe units are correct, as $\\frac{\\text{C}\\cdot\\text{m}^{-1}}{\\text{F}\\cdot\\text{m}^{-1}} = \\frac{\\text{C}}{\\text{F}} = \\frac{\\text{C}}{\\text{C}\\cdot\\text{V}^{-1}} = \\text{V}$. An energy in eV is numerically equal to this value.\n\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{vac}} = -1.96 \\text{ eV} $$\nAnd since $\\Delta \\Phi_B = \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{vac}}$:\n$$ \\Delta \\Phi_B = -1.96 \\text{ eV} $$\nBoth results are evaluated and presented in the required order.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -1.96 & -1.96 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2775586"}]}
