We shall proceed with a rigorous derivation followed by the calculation.\n\nThe first part of the problem requires us to demonstrate why the reversible work, $W_{\\mathrm{rev}}$, to create an interfacial area $A$ is equal to the product of the interfacial free energy per unit area, $\\gamma$, and the area $A$, under specific thermodynamic conditions.\n\nWe begin with the fundamental thermodynamic description of a multi-component system that includes an interface. The internal energy, $U$, of such a system is a function not only of its entropy $S$, volume $V$, and the number of moles of its chemical components $\\{n_i\\}$, but also of the interfacial area, $A$. The fundamental differential form for $U$ is:\n$$dU = TdS - pdV + \\sum_i \\mu_i dn_i + \\gamma_{U} dA$$\nwhere $T$ is temperature, $p$ is pressure, $\\mu_i$ is the chemical potential of component $i$, and $\\gamma_{U} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial A}\\right)_{S,V,n_i}$ is defined as the specific interfacial energy.\n\nThe experimental conditions specified are constant temperature $T$ and constant pressure $p$. In such situations, the Gibbs free energy, $G$, is the most appropriate thermodynamic potential. The Gibbs free energy is defined by the Legendre transformation of the internal energy:\n$$G = U - TS + pV$$\nThe total differential of $G$ is therefore:\n$$dG = dU - TdS - SdT + pdV + Vdp$$\nSubstituting the expression for $dU$ into this equation yields:\n$$dG = (TdS - pdV + \\sum_i \\mu_i dn_i + \\gamma_{U} dA) - TdS - SdT + pdV + Vdp$$\nUpon simplification, we obtain the fundamental equation for the Gibbs free energy in a system with an interface:\n$$dG = -SdT + Vdp + \\sum_i \\mu_i dn_i + \\gamma dA$$\nNote that the coefficient of $dA$ is now denoted as $\\gamma$, which is the specific interfacial Gibbs free energy, or simply interfacial free energy. From this equation, $\\gamma$ is precisely defined as the partial derivative of the Gibbs free energy with respect to area at constant temperature, pressure, and composition:\n$$\\gamma = \\left(\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial A}\\right)_{T,p,n_i}$$\nFor a pure metal, the composition term $\\sum_i \\mu_i dn_i$ is zero as long as the total amount of substance is constant.\n\nNext, we establish the connection between the change in Gibbs free energy and reversible work. The First Law of Thermodynamics states that $dU = \\delta Q + \\delta W$, where $\\delta Q$ is the heat supplied to the system and $\\delta W$ is the work done on the system.\nFor a thermodynamically reversible process, the heat exchanged is $\\delta Q_{\\mathrm{rev}} = TdS$. The total work done, $\\delta W_{\\mathrm{rev}}$, consists of work due to volume changes against the external pressure, $-pdV$, and any other forms of work, which we denote as non-$pV$ work, $\\delta W_{\\mathrm{rev, non-pV}}$.\n$$\\delta W_{\\mathrm{rev}} = -pdV + \\delta W_{\\mathrm{rev, non-pV}}$$\nSubstituting these into the First Law for a reversible process:\n$$dU = TdS - pdV + \\delta W_{\\mathrm{rev, non-pV}}$$\nNow, consider the change in Gibbs free energy, $dG = dU - d(TS) + d(pV)$, for a process occurring at constant temperature $T$ and constant pressure $p$. Under these constraints, $d(TS) = TdS$ and $d(pV) = pdV$.\nThus, $dG|_{T,p} = dU - TdS + pdV$.\nSubstituting the expression for $dU$ from the first law into this equation for $dG|_{T,p}$:\n$$dG|_{T,p} = (TdS - pdV + \\delta W_{\\mathrm{rev, non-pV}}) - TdS + pdV$$\nThis simplifies to a crucial result:\n$$dG|_{T,p} = \\delta W_{\\mathrm{rev, non-pV}}$$\nThis equation states that for any reversible process at constant temperature and pressure, the change in the system's Gibbs free energy is exactly equal to the non-pressure-volume work done on the system.\n\nThe problem statement specifies that the only non-$pV$ work is that required to create the new interfacial area. Therefore, $\\delta W_{\\mathrm{rev, non-pV}}$ is the work done to create an infinitesimal area $dA$, which we can simply write as $\\delta W_{\\mathrm{rev}}$.\n$$dG|_{T,p,n_i} = \\delta W_{\\mathrm{rev}}$$\nWe now have two expressions for the differential change in Gibbs free energy at constant $T$, $p$, and composition:\n1. From its definition: $dG|_{T,p,n_i} = \\gamma dA$\n2. From the work theorem: $dG|_{T,p,n_i} = \\delta W_{\\mathrm{rev}}$\nEquating these gives the relationship between infinitesimal work and infinitesimal area change:\n$$\\delta W_{\\mathrm{rev}} = \\gamma dA$$\nTo find the total reversible work, $W_{\\mathrm{rev}}$, needed to create a finite interfacial area $A$ starting from zero area, we must integrate this expression:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{rev}} = \\int_{0}^{A} \\gamma \\, dA'$$\nFor this integral to evaluate to $W_{\\mathrm{rev}} = \\gamma A$, we must make the assumption that $\\gamma$ is constant and does not depend on the area $A'$.\n\nTherefore, the equality $W_{\\mathrm{rev}} = \\gamma A$ holds under the following assumptions:\n1. The process of creating the interface is **thermodynamically reversible**.\n2. The process occurs at **constant temperature** and **constant pressure**.\n3. The only work done on the system, other than pressure-volume work, is the work to create the interface.\n4. The specific interfacial free energy, $\\gamma$, is **constant** with respect to the area being created. This is a valid assumption for a macroscopic, flat interface where curvature effects and edge effects are negligible, and the equilibrium structure of the interface is independent of its extent.\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we must compute the interfacial free energy $\\gamma$ given the experimental data.\nThe measured work is $W = 0.35 \\text{ J}$ for creating an interfacial area $A = 2.0 \\text{ cm}^2$. The problem states the process is reversible, so we identify $W$ with $W_{\\mathrm{rev}}$.\nFrom the derived relationship, we have $\\gamma = \\frac{W_{\\mathrm{rev}}}{A}$.\nFirst, we must express the area $A$ in SI units ($\\text{m}^2$) to be consistent with the units of work (Joules).\nGiven $1 \\text{ m} = 100 \\text{ cm}$, we have $1 \\text{ m}^2 = (100 \\text{ cm})^2 = 10000 \\text{ cm}^2 = 10^4 \\text{ cm}^2$.\nTherefore, $A = 2.0 \\text{ cm}^2 = 2.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m}^2$.\n\nNow, we can calculate $\\gamma$:\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{0.35 \\text{ J}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m}^2} = \\frac{0.35}{2.0} \\times 10^{4} \\text{ J m}^{-2}$$\n$$\\gamma = 0.175 \\times 10^{4} \\text{ J m}^{-2} = 1750 \\text{ J m}^{-2}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to two significant figures, consistent with the precision of the input data ($0.35$ J and $2.0$ cm$^2$).\nRounding $1750 \\text{ J m}^{-2}$ to two significant figures gives $1800 \\text{ J m}^{-2}$, which is best expressed in scientific notation as $1.8 \\times 10^3 \\text{ J m}^{-2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.8 \\times 10^{3}}$$", "id": "2772526"}, {"introduction": "The properties of a grain boundary are dictated by its structure, which is fundamentally defined by the crystallographic misorientation between the adjacent grains.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from first principles as required. Let there be a crystal-fixed coordinate system and a sample-fixed (laboratory) coordinate system. A vector's representation in the crystal frame is denoted $\\mathbf{v}_{c}$, and its representation in the sample frame is $\\mathbf{v}_{s}$. The orientation matrix $R$ transforms the vector components from the crystal frame to the sample frame: $\\mathbf{v}_{s} = R \\mathbf{v}_{c}$.\n\nFor grain $1$, a vector $\\mathbf{v}_{c}$ in its crystal lattice frame is expressed in the sample frame as:\n$$ \\mathbf{v}_{s,1} = R_{1} \\mathbf{v}_{c} $$\nFor grain $2$, the same crystal lattice vector is expressed in the sample frame as:\n$$ \\mathbf{v}_{s,2} = R_{2} \\mathbf{v}_{c} $$\nThe misorientation is defined as the rotation operator, which we denote $\\Delta R$, that maps the orientation of grain $1$ to that of grain $2$. This means it transforms the set of sample-frame vectors corresponding to grain $1$ into the set corresponding to grain $2$.\n$$ \\mathbf{v}_{s,2} = \\Delta R \\, \\mathbf{v}_{s,1} $$\nSubstituting the first two relations into this third one yields:\n$$ R_{2} \\mathbf{v}_{c} = \\Delta R (R_{1} \\mathbf{v}_{c}) $$\nSince this must hold for any arbitrary vector $\\mathbf{v}_{c}$, the matrix operators must be equal:\n$$ R_{2} = \\Delta R \\, R_{1} $$\nTo solve for the misorientation operator $\\Delta R$, we post-multiply by the inverse of $R_{1}$:\n$$ \\Delta R = R_{2} R_{1}^{-1} $$\nFor any orthogonal matrix, the inverse is equal to its transpose, $R_{1}^{-1} = R_{1}^{T}$. Therefore, the expression for the misorientation operator is:\n$$ \\Delta R = R_{2} R_{1}^{T} $$\nThis completes the derivation of the operator.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression for the given matrices.

The problem provides a complete set of physical parameters and modeling assumptions necessary to derive a unique, meaningful solution. All data are scientifically consistent and typical for the materials and phenomena described. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the estimation of the grain boundary energy per unit area, $\\gamma$, for a symmetric low-angle tilt boundary. According to the Frank–Bilby framework and the subsequent model developed by Read and Shockley, such a boundary can be represented as a periodic array of parallel edge dislocations. The energy of the boundary is then the total elastic strain energy of these dislocations, averaged over the area of the boundary.\n\nFirst, we establish the geometric relationship between the misorientation angle $\\theta$ and the spacing $D$ between the dislocations in the array. Consider two crystal lattices misoriented by a small angle $\\theta$ about an axis lying in the boundary plane. The tilt is accommodated by a vertical wall of edge dislocations, all with the same Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$ of magnitude $b$. From the geometry of the boundary, the vertical distance $D$ between adjacent dislocations is related to the magnitude of the Burgers vector $b$ and the misorientation angle $\\theta$ by the equation:\n$$b = 2D \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)$$\nFor low-angle grain boundaries, $\\theta$ is small, so we can use the small-angle approximation $\\sin(\\theta/2) \\approx \\theta/2$. The relation simplifies to:\n$$b \\approx 2D \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = D\\theta$$\nTherefore, the spacing between dislocations is inversely proportional to the misorientation angle:\n$$D = \\frac{b}{\\theta}$$\nIt is important to note that for this approximation to be accurate, $\\theta$ must be expressed in radians.\n\nNext, we consider the elastic strain energy of a single edge dislocation. Within the framework of isotropic linear elasticity, the strain energy stored in the elastic field per unit length of an edge dislocation, $W_L$, is given by:\n$$W_L = \\frac{\\mu b^{2}}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_{0}}\\right)$$\nHere, $\\mu$ is the shear modulus, $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio, $b$ is the magnitude of the Burgers vector, $r_{0}$ is the dislocation core cutoff radius (defining the inner limit of the elastic field), and $R$ is the outer cutoff radius (defining the extent of the strain field). The problem specifies that we neglect any non-logarithmic contributions, which typically refers to the energy stored within the highly distorted core region, so this expression for elastic energy is sufficient.\n\nThe grain boundary energy per unit area, $\\gamma$, is the total dislocation energy per unit area of the boundary plane. Since the dislocations are arranged in a periodic array with spacing $D$, the number of dislocation lines per unit length along the boundary (in the direction perpendicular to the dislocation lines) is $1/D$. Thus, the energy per unit area is the energy per unit length of a single dislocation divided by the spacing between dislocations:\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{W_L}{D} = \\frac{1}{D} \\left( \\frac{\\mu b^{2}}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_{0}}\\right) \\right)$$\n\nThe problem provides specific instructions for the cutoff radii. The inner core cutoff radius is to be taken as the magnitude of the Burgers vector, $r_{0} = b$. The outer cutoff radius $R$ for the strain field of a given dislocation is to be taken as the spacing to the next dislocation, $R = D$. This is a physically motivated choice, as the long-range stress fields of the dislocations in the array tend to cancel each other out at distances greater than their spacing.\n\nSubstituting these conditions, $r_{0}=b$ and $R=D$, into the expression for $\\gamma$:\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{D} \\frac{\\mu b^{2}}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{D}{b}\\right)$$\nNow, we substitute the geometric relation $D = b/\\theta$ into this equation:\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{\\theta}{b} \\frac{\\mu b^{2}}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{b/\\theta}{b}\\right)$$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{\\mu b \\theta}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\right)$$\nThis is the well-known Read-Shockley equation for the energy of a low-angle tilt boundary under the specified assumptions.
