The problem is free of factual errors, contradictions, and ambiguities. A unique solution is attainable through standard methods of stability analysis. Thus, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe total potential energy of the system, $U(x;X)$, is given as the sum of the elastic energy of the spring and the interaction potential with the substrate:\n$$\nU(x;X) = \\frac{1}{2} k (x - X)^{2} + V(x)\n$$\nwhere the substrate potential is specified as:\n$$\nV(x) = U_{0} \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}x\\right)\n$$\nHere, $x$ is the position of the tip, $X$ is the position of the support, $k$ is the spring stiffness, $U_0$ is the corrugation amplitude, and $a$ is the lattice period of the substrate. The system operates in the quasistatic limit at zero temperature, $T=0$, meaning the tip always resides in a local minimum of the total potential $U(x;X)$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the critical stiffness $k_c$**\n\nFor the tip to be in a state of mechanical equilibrium, the net force on it must be zero. This corresponds to an extremum of the total potential energy with respect to the tip's position $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nCalculating this derivative, we obtain the equilibrium condition:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x} = k(x - X) - U_{0} \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}x\\right) = 0\n$$\nThis equation relates the equilibrium position $x$ of the tip to the support position $X$.\n\nFor an equilibrium to be stable, it must correspond to a local minimum of the potential energy, not a maximum or a saddle point. This requires the second derivative of the potential energy with respect to $x$ to be positive:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial x^2}  0\n$$\nCalculating the second derivative yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial x^2} = k - U_{0} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^2 \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}x\\right)\n$$\nThus, the condition for a stable equilibrium is:\n$$\nk - U_{0} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^2 \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}x\\right)  0\n$$\nThe system exhibits smooth sliding if, for any given support position $X$, there is always one and only one stable equilibrium position $x$. This requires the stability condition, $\\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial x^2}  0$, to be satisfied for all possible equilibrium positions $x$ that the tip might occupy as $X$ is varied.\n\nStick-slip motion arises when this condition is violated. The system loses stability when the potential minimum in which the tip resides vanishes. The transition point between the smooth sliding regime and the stick-slip regime is defined by the critical stiffness, $k_c$, at which the stability can first be lost. This occurs when the second derivative can become zero for some position $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial x^2} = 0\n$$\nThe stability is most challenged (i.e., $\\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial x^2}$ is at its minimum) at the points where the term subtracted from $k$ is maximal. The function $\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}x\\right)$ has a maximum value of $1$. The condition is most stringent when $\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}x\\right) = 1$. This corresponds to tip positions $x=na$ for integer $n$, which are the maxima of the substrate potential $V(x)$. At these points, the curvature of the substrate potential is most negative, making the system most susceptible to instability.\n\nThe critical stiffness $k_c$ is the value of $k$ for which the stability condition is marginally met at these most unstable points. Setting $\\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial x^2} = 0$ with $\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}x\\right) = 1$:\n$$\nk_c - U_{0} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^2 (1) = 0\n$$\nSolving for $k_c$, we obtain the expression for the critical stiffness:\n$$\nk_c = U_{0} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 U_0}{a^2}\n$$\nIf $k  k_c$, the total potential has a single minimum for all $X$, and sliding is smooth. If $k  k_c$, there are ranges of $X$ for which the potential has multiple minima, leading to hysteretic jumps, i.e., stick-slip motion.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical evaluation of $k_c$**\n\nWe are given the parameters $U_0 = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $a = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.

A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Static Friction Force**\n\nThe analysis is based on two fundamental conditions: mechanical equilibrium and the loss of stability of that equilibrium.\n\n1.  **Mechanical Equilibrium**\n    In the quasi-static limit, the tip is always in mechanical equilibrium. This means the net force on the tip is zero. The force is the negative gradient of the total potential energy $V(x;X)$ with respect to the tip position $x$.\n    $$ F_{net} = -\\frac{\\partial V(x;X)}{\\partial x} = 0 $$\n    Let us compute this derivative:\n    $$ -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left[ \\frac{k}{2}(x-X)^{2} + U_{0}\\left(1-\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\right) \\right] = 0 $$\n    $$ -\\left[ k(x-X) + U_{0} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\right] = 0 $$\n    This gives the equilibrium equation:\n    $$ k(X-x) = \\frac{2\\pi U_{0}}{a} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) $$\n    The term on the left, $F_{spring} = k(X-x)$, is the force exerted by the spring on the tip. The term on the right is the force exerted by the substrate on the tip. By definition, the static friction force $F_{s}$ is the magnitude of this spring force, $F_s = k|X-x|$. We assume pulling in the positive direction, so $Xx$ and $F_s = k(X-x)$.\n\n2.  **Loss of Stability**\n    The tip resides in a local minimum of the potential energy $V(x;X)$. A stable equilibrium requires the second derivative of the potential to be positive:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial^{2} V(x;X)}{\\partial x^{2}}  0 $$\n    The static friction force $F_{s}^{\\mathrm{max}}$ is reached at the exact moment this minimum becomes unstable and disappears, which occurs when it merges with a local maximum to form a saddle point (an inflection point in this one-dimensional projection). At this critical point, the condition for stability is marginally violated:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial^{2} V(x;X)}{\\partial x^{2}} = 0 $$\n    Let us compute the second derivative:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial^{2} V(x;X)}{\\partial x^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left[ k(x-X) + \\frac{2\\pi U_{0}}{a} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) \\right] = k + \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^{2} U_{0} \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) $$\n    Setting this to zero gives the instability condition at the critical tip position $x_{c}$:\n    $$ k + \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^{2} U_{0} \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x_{c}}{a}\\right) = 0 $$\n\n3.  **Solving for the Maximum Static Friction Force**\n    We now have a system of two equations for the critical point $(x_{c}, X_{c})$:\n    (i) Equilibrium: $F_{s}^{\\mathrm{max}} = k(X_{c}-x_{c}) = \\frac{2\\pi U_{0}}{a} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x_{c}}{a}\\right)$\n    (ii) Instability: $k = -\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^{2} U_{0} \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x_{c}}{a}\\right)$\n\n    From the instability equation (ii), we solve for the cosine term:\n    $$ \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x_{c}}{a}\\right) = -\\frac{k}{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^{2} U_{0}} = -k \\frac{a^{2}}{4\\pi^{2} U_{0}} $$\n    The condition given in the problem, $k  \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^{2}U_{0}$, ensures that the magnitude of this cosine value is less than $1$, so a real solution for $x_{c}$ exists.\n\n    Now, we find the corresponding sine term using the trigonometric identity $\\sin^{2}\\theta + \\cos^{2}\\theta = 1$:\n    $$ \\sin^{2}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x_{c}}{a}\\right) = 1 - \\cos^{2}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x_{c}}{a}\\right) = 1 - \\left(-k \\frac{a^{2}}{4\\pi^{2} U_{0}}\\right)^{2} = 1 - \\frac{k^{2} a^{4}}{16\\pi^{4} U_{0}^{2}} $$\n    Since we are considering the first slip event as the tip is pulled from a minimum near $x=0$ in the positive direction, the substrate force opposes this pull, meaning $\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x_{c}}{a}\\right)  0$. We therefore take the positive root:\n    $$ \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x_{c}}{a}\\right) = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{k a^{2}}{4\\pi^{2} U_{0}}\\right)^{2}} $$\n    Finally, we substitute this expression for the sine term into the equilibrium equation (i) to find the maximum static friction force, $F_{s}^{\\mathrm{max}}$:\n    $$ F_{s}^{\\mathrm{max}} = \\frac{2\\pi U_{0}}{a} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x_{c}}{a}\\right) $$\n    $$ F_{s}^{\\mathrm{max}} = \\frac{2\\pi U_{0}}{a} \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{k a^{2}}{4\\pi^{2} U_{0}}\\right)^{2}} $$\n    This is the final closed-form expression for the maximum static friction force in the Tomlinson model under the specified conditions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2\\pi U_{0}}{a} \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{k a^{2}}{4\\pi^{2} U_{0}}\\right)^{2}}}\n$$", "id": "2780024"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the static regime lies the realm of dynamic friction, where the system is in continuous motion.

Therefore, we proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system consists of a chain of particles, and the motion of the $i$-th particle at position $x_{i}$ is governed by Newton's second law. The total force on this particle is the sum of the force from the neighboring springs, the force from the substrate potential, the external driving force, and the viscous drag force.

Also, the driving force $F$ is uniform across all particles. Due to this symmetry, the configuration of lowest energy for the moving chain is one of rigid, collective motion. All particles move together, maintaining their relative spacing. We can describe the position of the $i$-th particle by a single collective coordinate $X(t)$ as:\n$$x_{i}(t) = X(t) + (i-1)a$$\nThis ansatz implies that the distance between any two adjacent particles is always $a$, i.e., $x_{i+1} - x_{i} = a$.\n\nSubstituting this into the spring force term yields:\n$$F_{\\text{spring}, i} = K((x_{i+1}-x_i) - (x_i-x_{i-1})) = K(a - a) = 0$$\nThe springs remain at their natural length and thus exert no force.\nThe substrate force on particle $i$ becomes:\n$$F_{\\text{substrate}, i} = - \\frac{2\\pi U_{0}}{a} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi (X(t) + (i-1)a)}{a}\\right) = - \\frac{2\\pi U_{0}}{a} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi X(t)}{a} + 2\\pi(i-1)\\right) = - \\frac{2\\pi U_{0}}{a} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi X(t)}{a}\\right)$$\nThis term is now independent of the particle index $i$. All particles experience the same substrate force simultaneously. The velocity of each particle is $\\dot{x}_{i} = \\dot{X}(t)$.\n\nThe equation of motion for the entire chain simplifies to a single equation for the collective coordinate $X(t)$:\n$$\\eta \\frac{dX}{dt} = F - \\frac{2\\pi U_{0}}{a} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi X}{a}\\right)$$\n\nFirst, we identify the depinning threshold, $F_{s}$. This is the maximum static force from the substrate that the driving force must overcome. If the chain is to remain pinned, its velocity must be zero, $\\frac{dX}{dt}=0$. This requires a static equilibrium position $X_{0}$ such that:\n$$F = \\frac{2\\pi U_{0}}{a} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi X_{0}}{a}\\right)$$\nA real solution for $X_{0}$ exists only if the magnitude of the driving force $F$ is less than or equal to the amplitude of the sinusoidal substrate force. The maximum value of the substrate's resistive force is:\n$$F_{s} = \\max\\left| \\frac{2\\pi U_{0}}{a} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi X}{a}\\right) \\right| = \\frac{2\\pi U_{0}}{a}$$\nFor any driving force $F \\le F_{s}$, the chain can find an equilibrium position where it remains pinned. Thus, the steady-state velocity is $v=0$ for $F \\le F_{s}$.\n\nSecond, for $F  F_{s}$, no static equilibrium is possible. The net force on the right-hand side is always positive, and the chain slides with a non-zero steady-state velocity $v$. This velocity is the average velocity, $v = \\langle \\dot{X}(t) \\rangle$. We can calculate this by finding the time $T$ required for the system to traverse one period of the potential, which is a distance $a$.\n$$v = \\frac{a}{T}$$\nThe time $T$ is found by integrating $dt$ over one period of motion in $X$:\n$$T = \\int_{0}^{a} dt = \\int_{0}^{a} \\frac{dX}{\\dot{X}(t)} = \\int_{0}^{a} \\frac{\\eta}{F - \\frac{2\\pi U_{0}}{a} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi X}{a}\\right)} dX$$\nLet us perform a change of variables with $\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi X}{a}$, so $dX = \\frac{a}{2\\pi} d\\theta$.

For $F  F_{s}$, its value is known to be:\n$$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\theta}{A - B \\sin(\\theta)} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{A^{2} - B^{2}}} \\quad (\\text{for } A  |B|)$$\nIn our case, $A=F$ and $B=F_{s}$, and we are in the regime $F  F_{s}  0$. Therefore:\n$$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\theta}{F - F_{s} \\sin(\\theta)} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{F^{2} - F_{s}^{2}}}$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $T$:\n$$T = \\frac{\\eta a}{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{F^{2} - F_{s}^{2}}} \\right) = \\frac{\\eta a}{\\sqrt{F^{2} - F_{s}^{2}}}$$\nThe steady-state velocity for $F  F_{s}$ is then:\n$$v = \\frac{a}{T} = \\frac{a \\sqrt{F^{2} - F_{s}^{2}}}{\\eta a} = \\frac{\\sqrt{F^{2} - F_{s}^{2}}}{\\eta}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $F_{s}$:\n$$v(F) = \\frac{\\sqrt{F^{2} - \\left(\\frac{2\\pi U_{0}}{a}\\right)^{2}}}{\\eta} \\quad \\text{for } F  F_s$$\n\nWe can write a single expression for $v(F)$ covering both the pinned ($F \\le F_{s}$) and sliding ($F  F_{s}$) regimes using the Heaviside step function, $\\Theta(z)$, defined as $\\Theta(z) = 0$ for $z \\le 0$ and $\\Theta(z) = 1$ for $z  0$. Some definitions vary at $z=0$, but for representing distinct physical regimes, this choice is appropriate. Using $\\Theta(F - F_{s})$ ensures the expression is zero for $F \\le F_{s}$.\nThe complete velocity-force characteristic is:\n$$v(F) = \\frac{\\sqrt{F^{2} - \\left(\\frac{2\\pi U_{0}}{a}\\right)^{2}}}{\\eta} \\Theta\\left(F - \\frac{2\\pi U_{0}}{a}\\right)$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytical expression for the steady-state velocity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\frac{\\sqrt{F^{2} - \\left(\\frac{2\\pi U_{0}}{a}\\right)^{2}}}{\\eta} \\Theta\\left(F - \\frac{2\\pi U_{0}}{a}\\right)\n}\n$$", "id": "2779995"}]}
