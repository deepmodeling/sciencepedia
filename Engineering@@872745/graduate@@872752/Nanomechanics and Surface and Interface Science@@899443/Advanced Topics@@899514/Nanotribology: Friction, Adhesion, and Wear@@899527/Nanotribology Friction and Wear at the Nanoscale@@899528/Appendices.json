Do not include units in your final answer.", "solution": "The problem requires an assessment of the validity of continuum elasticity for an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip in contact with a crystalline surface. The fundamental criterion for the applicability of a continuum model is the principle of separation of scales. This principle states that the characteristic length scale over which the macroscopic fields (such as stress and displacement) vary, denoted here as $L$, must be significantly larger than the characteristic length scale of the underlying discrete microstructure, denoted as $l$. Mathematically, this condition is expressed as $L \\gg l$.\n\nFirst, we must identify the relevant length scales from the problem statement.\nThe problem specifies that the characteristic lateral variation length for the fields is the diameter of the contact area, $D_c$. The contact is given as nominally circular with a lateral radius $a_c$. Therefore, the characteristic length scale of the field variation is:\n$$L = D_c = 2 a_c$$\n\nThe underlying microstructure is the crystalline lattice of sodium chloride (NaCl). The characteristic length of this discrete structure is its cubic lattice constant, $a$. Thus, we have:\n$$l = a$$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- The contact radius, $a_c = 5\\,\\text{nm}$.\n- The lattice constant of NaCl, $a = 0.56\\,\\text{nm}$.\n\nTo quantify the separation of scales, we compute the dimensionless ratio $N$, which represents the number of lattice spacings (or unit cells) that fit across the contact diameter. This number is given by:\n$$N = \\frac{L}{l} = \\frac{D_c}{a} = \\frac{2 a_c}{a}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression.\n$$N = \\frac{2 \\times 5\\,\\text{nm}}{0.56\\,\\text{nm}}$$\nThe units of nanometers ($\\text{nm}$) in the numerator and denominator cancel, rendering $N$ a dimensionless quantity, as expected.\n$$N = \\frac{10}{0.56}$$\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$N \\approx 17.85714...$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed to three significant figures. Rounding the calculated value yields:\n$$N \\approx 17.9$$\n\nThis value, $N \\approx 17.9$, quantifies the scale separation. It signifies that the contact diameter spans approximately $18$ lattice constants of the NaCl crystal.\n\nFinally, we must assess whether continuum elasticity is justified. For a continuum description to be considered highly accurate, the ratio $N$ should be large, typically on the order of $100$ or more. A value of $N \\approx 18$ represents a borderline case. While it is not so small (e.g., $N  5$) as to render continuum mechanics completely invalid, it is also not large enough to ignore the discreteness of the atomic lattice. At this scale, the properties of individual atoms and the specific crystallographic orientation can have a non-negligible effect on the contact mechanics, leading to phenomena such as anisotropic friction and deviations from the predictions of classical continuum theories like Hertzian contact mechanics. Therefore, the application of continuum elasticity is questionable and would likely serve only as a first-order approximation. For a more accurate description, atomistic simulation methods would be required.
