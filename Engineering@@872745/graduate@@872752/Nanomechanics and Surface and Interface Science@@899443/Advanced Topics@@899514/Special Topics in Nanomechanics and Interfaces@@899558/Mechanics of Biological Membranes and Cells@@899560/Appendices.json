It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in the field of membrane nanomechanics, based on the established Helfrich model for lipid bilayers. All necessary parameters and assumptions are provided, and no contradictions or factual errors are present. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the force-radius relation for a cylindrical membrane tether. We begin by constructing the total free energy of the system, which is a functional of the tether's radius $r$ and length $L$. The problem statement provides the Helfrich energy density $w$ for a membrane with zero spontaneous curvature, $w = \\frac{\\kappa}{2} (2H)^{2} + \\sigma$, where $\\kappa$ is the bending modulus, $\\sigma$ is the surface tension, and $H$ is the mean curvature.\n\nFirst, we determine the mean curvature $H$ for the specified geometry: a perfect circular cylinder of radius $r$. The two principal curvatures of a cylinder are $\\kappa_1 = \\frac{1}{r}$ (along the azimuthal direction) and $\\kappa_2 = 0$ (along the axial direction). The mean curvature is defined as $H = \\frac{1}{2}(\\kappa_1 + \\kappa_2)$.\nTherefore, for the cylinder, we have:\n$$H = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{r} + 0 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2r}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total internal free energy of the membrane tether, $F_H$, by integrating the energy density $w$ over the surface area of the cylinder. The problem allows us to neglect the end-caps, so the area $A$ is simply the area of the cylindrical wall, $A = 2\\pi r L$.\n$$F_H(r, L) = \\int_A w \\,dA = w \\cdot A$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $w$, $H$, and $A$:\n$$F_H(r, L) = \\left[ \\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\left( 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2r} \\right)^2 + \\sigma \\right] (2\\pi r L)$$\n$$F_H(r, L) = \\left[ \\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\right)^2 + \\sigma \\right] (2\\pi r L) = \\left( \\frac{\\kappa}{2r^2} + \\sigma \\right) (2\\pi r L)$$\nDistributing the terms, we find the internal energy:\n$$F_H(r, L) = \\frac{\\pi \\kappa L}{r} + 2\\pi \\sigma r L$$\nThis internal energy comprises a bending energy term, which scales as $1/r$, and a surface tension energy term, which scales as $r$.\n\nThe problem states that a constant axial force $f$ is applied to extend the tether. This force performs work on the system. The total free energy $F(r, L)$ of the system in the ensemble of constant applied force includes the potential energy associated with this force. This potential energy is $-fL$. Therefore, the total free energy to be made stationary is:\n$$F(r, L) = F_H(r, L) - fL = \\frac{\\pi \\kappa L}{r} + 2\\pi \\sigma r L - fL$$\nWe can factor out the length $L$:\n$$F(r, L) = L \\left( \\frac{\\pi \\kappa}{r} + 2\\pi \\sigma r - f \\right)$$\n\nThe problem instructs to find the force-radius relation $f(r)$ by applying the stationarity conditions. The system is in mechanical equilibrium when the total free energy is stationary with respect to variations in its degrees of freedom. We are told to treat $r$ and $L$ as independent variational parameters. The equilibrium condition with respect to the tether length $L$ defines the relationship between the applied force and the internal restorative forces of the membrane.

For $m>0$, the pair of complex conjugate amplitudes $(u_{\\ell m}, u_{\\ell, -m})$ corresponds to two independent real variables (the real and imaginary parts of $u_{\\ell m}$), contributing a term $E_\\ell |u_{\\ell m}|^2$ to the energy.\n\nApplying the equipartition theorem:\nFor the $m=0$ mode, one degree of freedom:\n$$\\left\\langle \\frac{1}{2} E_\\ell |u_{\\ell 0}|^2 \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\mathrm{B}} T \\implies \\langle |u_{\\ell 0}|^2 \\rangle = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{E_\\ell}$$\nFor the $m>0$ modes, two degrees of freedom are contained within the energy term $E_\\ell |u_{\\ell m}|^2$:\n$$\\left\\langle E_\\ell |u_{\\ell m}|^2 \\right\\rangle = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\mathrm{B}} T = k_{\\mathrm{B}} T \\implies \\langle |u_{\\ell m}|^2 \\rangle = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{E_\\ell}$$\nThe result is independent of $m$. Thus, for all modes with $\\ell \\ge 2$:\n$$\\langle |u_{\\ell m}|^2 \\rangle = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{(\\ell-1)(\\ell+2) \\left[ \\kappa \\ell(\\ell+1) + \\sigma R_0^2 \\right]}$$\nThe problem provides data in the form of the rotationally averaged power spectrum, $C_\\ell$. The theoretical prediction for $C_\\ell$ is its ensemble average, which, due to the $m$-independence of $\\langle |u_{\\ell m}|^2 \\rangle$, simplifies to:\n$$\\langle C_\\ell \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{2\\ell + 1} \\sum_{m=-\\ell}^{\\ell} |u_{\\ell m}|^2 \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2\\ell + 1} \\sum_{m=-\\ell}^{\\ell} \\langle |u_{\\ell m}|^2 \\rangle = \\langle |u_{\\ell m}|^2 \\rangle$$\nTherefore, the theoretical model for the measured $C_\\ell$ is:\n$$C_\\ell^{\\text{theory}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{(\\ell-1)(\\ell+2) \\left[ \\kappa \\ell(\\ell+1) + \\sigma R_0^2 \\right]}$$\n\n**2. Algorithmic Design for Parameter Fitting**\n\nThe task is to estimate $\\kappa$ and $\\sigma$ by minimizing the sum of squared residuals, $S = \\sum_\\ell (C_\\ell^{\\text{meas}} - C_\\ell^{\\text{theory}})^2$. This is a non-linear least-squares problem. A robust pipeline to solve this is as follows:\n\nFirst, we linearize the model. By rearranging the expression for $C_\\ell^{\\text{theory}}$, we obtain a linear relationship:\n$$\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{C_\\ell (\\ell-1)(\\ell+2)} = \\kappa \\cdot \\ell(\\ell+1) + \\sigma R_0^2$$\nLetting $y_\\ell = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{C_\\ell (\\ell-1)(\\ell+2)}$ and $x_\\ell = \\ell(\\ell+1)$, the equation becomes $y_\\ell = \\kappa x_\\ell + (\\sigma R_0^2)$. This is the equation of a line $y = a x + b$, with slope $a = \\kappa$ and intercept $b = \\sigma R_0^2$.\n\nThe algorithmic pipeline is:\n1.  **Linear Fit for Initial Guess**: Transform the measured data pairs $(\\ell, C_\\ell^{\\text{meas}})$ into $(x_\\ell, y_\\ell)$. Perform a linear least-squares fit on this transformed data to obtain initial estimates for the slope $\\kappa_0$ and the intercept $b_0$. The initial guess for sigma is then $\\sigma_0 = b_0 / R_0^2$. For noise-free data as specified in the problem, this step alone would yield the exact parameters.\n2.  **Non-linear Optimization**: Use the initial guesses $(\\kappa_0, \\sigma_0)$ to seed a numerical non-linear optimization routine, such as the L-BFGS-B algorithm. This algorithm minimizes the original sum-of-squares objective function $S$ with respect to $\\kappa$ and $\\sigma$. This step directly satisfies the problem's requirement to minimize the residuals of $C_\\ell$.\n3.  **Constraint Enforcement**: The L-BFGS-B algorithm readily accommodates boundary constraints. We enforce $\\kappa > 0$ and $\\sigma \\ge 0$ during the optimization to ensure physically meaningful results.\n\nThis two-step approach combines the speed and stability of linear regression to find a near-perfect starting point with the rigor of non-linear optimization to find the true minimum of the objective function specified.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the vesicle fluctuation problem for all test cases.\n    It synthesizes fluctuation data based on a theoretical model and then fits\n    the model parameters (bending rigidity kappa and surface tension sigma) back.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define physical constant\n    K_B = 1.380649e-23  # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n    def theoretical_C_ell(ell, kappa, sigma, T, R0):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the theoretical fluctuation spectrum C_ell for given parameters.\n        The input 'ell' can be a scalar or a numpy array for vectorized calculation.\n        \"\"\"\n        numerator = K_B * T\n        ell = np.asarray(ell)\n        \n        # Check for invalid ell values to avoid division by zero or log of zero\n        if np.any(ell < 2):\n            raise ValueError(\"Mode index 'ell' must be >= 2.\")\n\n        factor1 = (ell - 1.0) * (ell + 2.0)\n        factor2 = kappa * ell * (ell + 1.0) + sigma * R0**2\n        \n        denominator = factor1 * factor2\n        \n        # Handle potential division by zero, although not expected for valid parameters\n        # and ell >= 2.\n        # This can be set to a large number or infinity to signify a negligible C_ell.\n        safe_denominator = np.where(denominator == 0, np.inf, denominator)\n        \n        return numerator / safe_denominator\n\n    def fit_spectrum(T, R0, ell_values, C_ell_meas):\n        \"\"\"\n        Fits kappa and sigma from measured fluctuation spectrum data.\n        A robust two-step method is used:\n        1.
