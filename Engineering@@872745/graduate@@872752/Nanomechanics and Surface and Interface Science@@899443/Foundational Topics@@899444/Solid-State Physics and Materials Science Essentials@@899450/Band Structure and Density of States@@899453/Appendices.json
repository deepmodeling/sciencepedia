The energy dispersion relation $E(\\mathbf{k})$ for a single, non-degenerate band near a minimum at wavevector $\\mathbf{k}_{0}$ is given by a quadratic Taylor expansion. Let $\\mathbf{q} = \\mathbf{k} - \\mathbf{k}_{0}$ be the wavevector relative to the band minimum.

The energy at the minimum is the conduction band edge, $E_{c} = E(\\mathbf{k}_{0})$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$E(\\mathbf{q}) - E_{c} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j} q_{i} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial k_i \\partial k_j} \\right)_{\\mathbf{k}_{0}} q_{j}$$\nThe inverse effective-mass tensor is defined as $(m^{-1})_{ij} = \\hbar^{-2} \\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial k_i \\partial k_j}|_{\\mathbf{k}_{0}}$. Substituting this definition gives the energy-wavevector relationship:\n$$E - E_{c} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} \\sum_{i,j} q_{i} (m^{-1})_{ij} q_{j}$$\nWe now transform into the principal-axis basis of the symmetric inverse effective-mass tensor. In this basis, the tensor is diagonal, with components $(m^{-1})_{xx} = 1/m_x$, $(m^{-1})_{yy} = 1/m_y$, and $(m^{-1})_{zz} = 1/m_z$. The equation for the energy becomes:\n$$E - E_{c} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} \\left( \\frac{q_x^2}{m_x} + \\frac{q_y^2}{m_y} + \\frac{q_z^2}{m_z} \\right)$$\nFor a constant energy $E  E_{c}$, this implicit equation can be rearranged into the canonical form of an ellipsoid in $\\mathbf{q}$-space (which is a translated $\\mathbf{k}$-space):\n$$ \\frac{q_x^2}{\\left(\\frac{2 m_x (E-E_c)}{\\hbar^2}\\right)} + \\frac{q_y^2}{\\left(\\frac{2 m_y (E-E_c)}{\\hbar^2}\\right)} + \\frac{q_z^2}{\\left(\\frac{2 m_z (E-E_c)}{\\hbar^2}\\right)} = 1 $$\nThis is the equation of an ellipsoid centered at $\\mathbf{q}=\\mathbf{0}$ (i.e., $\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{k}_0$), confirming that the constant-energy surfaces are ellipsoidal.\n\nSecond, we derive the density of states (DOS) per unit volume, $g(E)$. The number of quantum states, $N(E)$, with energy less than or equal to $E$ is found by calculating the volume in $\\mathbf{k}$-space enclosed by the constant-energy surface $E$, and dividing by the volume per state. Spin and valley degeneracy are neglected per the problem statement. In a crystal of volume $V_{crystal}$, each state occupies a $\\mathbf{k}$-space volume of $(2\\pi)^3/V_{crystal}$. The volume of the ellipsoid in $\\mathbf{k}$-space, $V_k(E)$, with semi-axes $a_k = \\sqrt{2m_x(E-E_c)}/\\hbar$, $b_k = \\sqrt{2m_y(E-E_c)}/\\hbar$, and $c_k = \\sqrt{2m_z(E-E_c)}/\\hbar$ is:\n$$V_k(E) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a_k b_k c_k = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\frac{\\left(2(E-E_c)\\right)^{3/2}}{\\hbar^3} \\sqrt{m_x m_y m_z}$$\nThe total number of states is then:\n$$N(E) = \\frac{V_k(E)}{(2\\pi)^3/V_{crystal}} = \\frac{V_{crystal}}{(2\\pi)^3} \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\frac{(2(E-E_c))^{3/2}}{\\hbar^3} \\sqrt{m_x m_y m_z}$$\nThe DOS per unit volume, $g(E)$, is the derivative of the number of states per unit volume with respect to energy:\n$$ g(E) = \\frac{1}{V_{crystal}} \\frac{dN(E)}{dE} = \\frac{d}{dE} \\left[ \\frac{1}{6\\pi^2} \\frac{(2(E-E_c))^{3/2}}{\\hbar^3} \\sqrt{m_x m_y m_z} \\right]$$\nPerforming the differentiation with respect to $E$:\n$$ g(E) = \\frac{\\sqrt{m_x m_y m_z}}{6\\pi^2\\hbar^3} (2)^{3/2} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} (E-E_c)^{1/2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{m_x m_y m_z}}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^3} \\sqrt{E-E_c} $$\n\nThird, we find the density-of-states effective mass, $m^{*}_{\\mathrm{DOS}}$. We must derive the DOS for a hypothetical isotropic band with a single effective mass $m^{*}_{\\mathrm{DOS}}$, such that $m_x=m_y=m_z=m^{*}_{\\mathrm{DOS}}$. The constant-energy surfaces are spheres, and the dispersion is $E-E_c = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m^{*}_{\\mathrm{DOS}}}$.

First, a conceptual explanation of the tetrahedron method for density of states (DOS) calculations. Second, a derivation of the affine energy interpolation formula within a single tetrahedron from first principles.\n\n**Part 1: Conceptual Basis of the Tetrahedron Method**\n\nThe density of states per unit volume, $D(E)$, for a given band structure $E_n(\\mathbf{k})$ is defined by the expression:\n$$D(E)=\\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{3}}\\sum_{n}\\int_{\\text{BZ}}\\delta\\!\\big(E-E_{n}(\\mathbf{k})\\big)\\,d^{3}\\mathbf{k}$$\nHere, the sum is over all bands $n$, the integral is over the first Brillouin zone (BZ), $\\mathbf{k}$ is the wave vector, and $\\delta(\\cdot)$ is the Dirac delta function. The tetrahedron method approximates this integral by partitioning the BZ into a large number of small, non-overlapping tetrahedra. The total DOS is the sum of the contributions from each tetrahedron. Let us consider the contribution from a single tetrahedron, $T$, for a single band (we drop the index $n$ for clarity):\n$$D_{T}(E) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{3}} \\int_{T} \\delta(E - E(\\mathbf{k})) \\,d^{3}\\mathbf{k}$$\nThe key assumption of the tetrahedron method is that within each small tetrahedron $T$, the energy dispersion $E(\\mathbf{k})$ can be accurately approximated by an affine function of $\\mathbf{k}$:\n$$E(\\mathbf{k}) \\approx \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{k} + b$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{a} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ is a constant vector and $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a constant scalar. These constants are specific to the tetrahedron $T$. The vector $\\mathbf{a}$ is the gradient of the energy within the tetrahedron, $\\mathbf{a} = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}}E(\\mathbf{k})$, which is constant under this approximation.\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we use the following property of the Dirac delta function for a scalar function $g(\\mathbf{k})$:\n$$\\int_{V} f(\\mathbf{k}) \\delta(g(\\mathbf{k})) \\, d^3\\mathbf{k} = \\int_{S_V} \\frac{f(\\mathbf{k})}{|\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} g(\\mathbf{k})|} \\, dS$$\nwhere $S_V$ is the surface defined by $g(\\mathbf{k})=0$ within the integration volume $V$, and $dS$ is the surface area element.\n\nIn our case, the argument of the delta function is $g(\\mathbf{k}) = E - E(\\mathbf{k}) = E - (\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{k} + b)$. The gradient of this function with respect to $\\mathbf{k}$ is:\n$$\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} g(\\mathbf{k}) = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} (E - \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{k} - b) = -\\mathbf{a}$$\nThe magnitude of this gradient is $|\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} g(\\mathbf{k})| = |-\\mathbf{a}| = |\\mathbf{a}| = |\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} E(\\mathbf{k})|$. Because we assumed an affine energy dependence, this magnitude is constant everywhere inside the tetrahedron $T$.\n\nThe condition $g(\\mathbf{k})=0$ corresponds to the equation $E = \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{k} + b$, which defines a plane in $\\mathbf{k}$-space. This is a constant-energy surface.\nThe integral for $D_T(E)$ (with $f(\\mathbf{k})=1$) becomes:\n$$D_{T}(E) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{3}} \\int_{S_T} \\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{a}|} \\, dS$$\nwhere $S_T$ is the portion of the constant-energy plane that lies inside the tetrahedron $T$. Since $|\\mathbf{a}|$ is constant, we can take it out of the integral:\n$$D_{T}(E) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{3} |\\mathbf{a}|} \\int_{S_T} \\, dS = \\frac{A_T(E)}{(2\\pi)^{3} |\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} E(\\mathbf{k})|}$$\nHere, $A_T(E) = \\int_{S_T} dS$ is simply the area of the planar cross-section created by the intersection of the constant-energy plane with the tetrahedron. This intersection is a polygon (either a triangle or a quadrilateral, depending on how the plane cuts the tetrahedron's edges). The area of such a polygon can be calculated analytically using elementary geometry once the intersection points with the tetrahedron edges are known.\n\nThus, the conceptual reason the tetrahedron method works is that the affine approximation transforms the complex $\\mathbf{k}$-space integral involving a delta function into a geometric problem: calculating the area of a planar slice through a tetrahedron. This area, $A_T(E)$, can be expressed as an analytic, albeit piecewise, function of energy $E$. The contribution to the DOS from each tetrahedron is then an analytic function of $E$, and summing these contributions over all tetrahedra provides an analytic approximation for the total DOS.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Interpolation Formula**\n\nWe are tasked with deriving the formula for the energy $E(\\mathbf{r})$ at an arbitrary point $\\mathbf{r}$ inside a tetrahedron with vertices $\\{\\mathbf{k}_{1}, \\mathbf{k}_{2}, \\mathbf{k}_{3}, \\mathbf{k}_{4}\\}$ and corresponding energies $\\{E_{1}, E_{2}, E_{3}, E_{4}\\}$. The energy is assumed to vary affinely within the tetrahedron.\n\nAn affine function is one that preserves affine combinations. An arbitrary point $\\mathbf{r}$ inside the tetrahedron (which is the convex hull of its vertices) can be written as a unique affine combination of the vertices:\n$$\\mathbf{r} = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} c_i \\mathbf{k}_i, \\quad \\text{with the constraint} \\quad \\sum_{i=1}^{4} c_i = 1$$\nThe coefficients $\\{c_i\\}$ are the barycentric coordinates of $\\mathbf{r}$ with respect to the vertices $\\{\\mathbf{k}_i\\}$. For $\\mathbf{r}$ to be inside the tetrahedron, we also have $c_i \\geq 0$ for all $i$.\n\nWe must derive the expressions for these coefficients from first principles. The two equations above form a system of linear equations. To express this system in a compact matrix form, we use homogeneous coordinates. Let the homogeneous representation of a vector $\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ be the vector $\\bar{\\mathbf{v}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{v} \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^4$. The system of equations can then be written as a single linear equation in $\\mathbb{R}^4$:\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{r} \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sum_{i=1}^{4} c_i \\mathbf{k}_i \\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^{4} c_i \\end{pmatrix} = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} c_i \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{k}_i \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} c_i \\bar{\\mathbf{k}}_i$$\nThis can be written as a matrix equation:\n$$\\bar{\\mathbf{r}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\bar{\\mathbf{k}}_1  \\bar{\\mathbf{k}}_2  \\bar{\\mathbf{k}}_3  \\bar{\\mathbf{k}}_4 \\end{pmatrix} \\mathbf{c}$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{c} = (c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4)^T$. Let us define the $4 \\times 4$ matrix $M$ whose columns are the homogeneous vertex vectors:\n$$M = \\begin{pmatrix} \\bar{\\mathbf{k}}_1  \\bar{\\mathbf{k}}_2  \\bar{\\mathbf{k}}_3  \\bar{\\mathbf{k}}_4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{k}_1  \\mathbf{k}_2  \\mathbf{k}_3  \\mathbf{k}_4 \\\\ 1  1  1  1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nAs long as the vertices do not lie on the same plane, the matrix $M$ is invertible. The vector of barycentric coordinates $\\mathbf{c}$ can then be formally solved for as:\n$$\\mathbf{c} = M^{-1} \\bar{\\mathbf{r}} = M^{-1} \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{r} \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis constitutes a derivation of the barycentric coordinates from first principles, as requested.\n\nNow, we use the property that an affine function preserves affine combinations. Since $E(\\mathbf{k})$ is affine and $\\mathbf{r} = \\sum c_i \\mathbf{k}_i$ with $\\sum c_i = 1$, the value of the function at $\\mathbf{r}$ is given by the same affine combination of the function values at the vertices:\n$$E(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} c_i E(\\mathbf{k}_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} c_i E_i$$\nThis sum can be expressed as a matrix product. Let $\\mathbf{E}$ be the row vector of energies $\\mathbf{E} = \\begin{pmatrix} E_1  E_2  E_3  E_4 \\end{pmatrix}$. Then:\n$$E(\\mathbf{r}) = \\mathbf{E} \\mathbf{c}$$\nSubstituting the expression we derived for the coordinate vector $\\mathbf{c}$:\n$$E(\\mathbf{r}) = \\mathbf{E} \\left( M^{-1} \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{r} \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$$\nThis is the final, unique, closed-form analytic expression for the interpolated energy $E(\\mathbf{r})$. It is expressed entirely in terms of the given quantities $\\{\\mathbf{k}_i\\}_{i=1}^4$, $\\{E_i\\}_{i=1}^4$, and the point $\\mathbf{r}$, using standard linear algebra notation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} E_1  E_2  E_3  E_4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{k}_1  \\mathbf{k}_2  \\mathbf{k}_3  \\mathbf{k}_4 \\\\ 1  1  1  1 \\end{pmatrix}^{-1} \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{r} \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2765581"}]}
