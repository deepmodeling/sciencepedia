It represents a standard analysis within the framework of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM). We shall proceed with the solution in four parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Expression for the Stress Intensity Factor $K_I$.\nThe stress field near the tip of a crack under mode I loading, according to the Williams expansion for linear elastic materials, has a characteristic inverse square-root singularity. For a position $(r, \\theta)$ in a polar coordinate system centered at the crack tip, the dominant term of the stress tensor $\\sigma_{ij}$ is given by\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij}(r, \\theta) = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} f_{ij}(\\theta) + O(r^0)\n$$\nwhere $K_I$ is the mode I stress intensity factor and $f_{ij}(\\theta)$ are dimensionless functions of the angle $\\theta$.\n\nFrom dimensional analysis, the stress intensity factor $K_I$ must have units of stress times the square root of length, i.e., $[\\text{Force}][\\text{Length}]^{-3/2}$. The problem involves a remote stress $\\sigma$ and a characteristic length, the crack size $a$. A simple dimensional combination is $\\sigma\\sqrt{a}$. For a crack in an infinite body, a factor of $\\sqrt{\\pi}$ is conventionally included. The presence of finite boundaries, such as the finite width $W$ of the plate, modifies this relationship by a dimensionless geometry function, $Y$, which depends on the ratio of the crack length to the width, $\\alpha = a/W$. Therefore, the general form for the mode I stress intensity factor for this configuration is\n$$\nK_I = Y(\\alpha) \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a}\n$$\nThe provided polynomial $Y(\\alpha)$ is an empirical fit for this specific geometry.
