This exercise [@problem_id:579012] presents a classic dilemma in naval architecture and ocean engineering: a system governed by gravity (requiring Froude number similarity) that also experiences significant viscous forces (dependent on the Reynolds number). By analyzing the drag on a mooring cable in a Froude-scaled experiment, you will derive the resulting scaling law for the drag force and see firsthand how and why it deviates from the scaling of other forces in the system, a critical concept known as \"scale effect.\"", "problem": "A team of ocean engineers is designing a scaled model experiment to study the dynamics of a large floating buoy.

The gravitational acceleration, $g$, is the same for both the prototype and the model.\n\nThe primary dynamics of the buoy, which involve wave generation and its response to surface waves, are governed by gravitational forces. Therefore, the experiment must be designed to maintain Froude number similarity, $Fr_m = Fr_p$, where the Froude number is defined as $Fr = V / \\sqrt{gL}$.\n\nHowever, the drag force on the mooring cable is primarily a viscous phenomenon. The drag force $F_D$ on a length $H$ of the cable is given by $F_D = \\frac{1}{2} C_D \\rho V^2 (H \\cdot D)$, where the drag coefficient $C_D$ is a function of the Reynolds number, $Re = \\rho V D / \\mu$. For the range of flow conditions anticipated, the drag coefficient for the cable can be approximated by the power-law relationship $C_D = K (Re)^n$, where $K$ and $n$ are empirical constants.\n\nLet the geometric scale ratio be $\\lambda = L_m/L_p$.

For such turbines, which often operate with a free surface at their outlet (e.g., the tailrace), it is critical to maintain Froude number similarity between the model (subscript $m$) and the prototype (subscript $p$) to ensure that gravitational and inertial forces are correctly scaled. This is expressed as $Fr_m = Fr_p$, where the Froude number is defined as $Fr = V/\\sqrt{gL}$, with $V$ being a characteristic velocity, $L$ a characteristic length, and $g$ the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nA consequence of enforcing Froude similarity is that Reynolds number similarity ($Re_m = Re_p$) is not simultaneously achieved, where $Re = \\rho V L / \\mu$ with $\\rho$ as fluid density and $\\mu$ as dynamic viscosity.
