A valve is opened, connecting the tank to a large supply line containing an ideal gas at a constant pressure $P_{line}$ and a constant temperature $T_{line}$. The gas flows into the tank until the pressure inside the tank, $P_f$, equals the supply line pressure, $P_{line}$.

State the Governing Equations**\n\nWe begin with the integral form of the conservation of energy for a control volume (CV), also known as the first law of thermodynamics for an open system:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_{cv}}{dt} = \\dot{Q}_{cv} - \\dot{W}_{cv} + \\sum \\dot{m}_{in} \\left(h + \\frac{v^2}{2} + gz\\right)_{in} - \\sum \\dot{m}_{out} \\left(h + \\frac{v^2}{2} + gz\\right)_{out}\n$$\nAnd the integral form of the conservation of mass:\n$$\n\\frac{dm_{cv}}{dt} = \\sum \\dot{m}_{in} - \\sum \\dot{m}_{out}\n$$\n\n**2. Simplify for the Specific Process**\n\nLet the control volume be the interior of the tank. We apply the problem's conditions to simplify the general equations:\n-   **Energy of the Control Volume:** The energy within the CV, $E_{cv}$, is purely internal energy, as kinetic and potential energies are negligible. For an ideal gas, internal energy is $U_{cv} = m_{cv}u_{cv}$, where $u_{cv}$ is the specific internal energy. So, $E_{cv} = m_{cv}u_{cv}$.\n-   **Work:** The tank is rigid, so there is no boundary work. We assume no shaft work. Thus, $\\dot{W}_{cv} = 0$.\n-   **Flows:** There is one inlet and no outlet. $\\dot{m}_{in}$ is the mass flow rate from the supply line, and $\\dot{m}_{out} = 0$.\n-   **Enthalpy:** The kinetic and potential energy terms of the incoming flow are negligible. The enthalpy of the incoming gas is $h_{in}$.\n-   **Heat Transfer:** $\\dot{Q}_{cv}$ is the rate of heat transfer *to* the control volume.\n\nThe simplified energy equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d(m_{cv}u_{cv})}{dt} = \\dot{Q}_{cv} + \\dot{m}_{in}h_{in}\n$$\nThe simplified mass equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dm_{cv}}{dt} = \\dot{m}_{in}\n$$\n\n**3. Integrate Over the Process Duration**\n\nWe integrate the energy equation from the initial state (time $t_1$) to the final state (time $t_2$):\n$$\n\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\frac{d(m_{cv}u_{cv})}{dt} dt = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\dot{Q}_{cv} dt + \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\dot{m}_{in}h_{in} dt\n$$\nThis yields:\n$$\n(m_{cv}u_{cv})_2 - (m_{cv}u_{cv})_1 = Q_{cv} + \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\dot{m}_{in}h_{in} dt\n$$\nwhere $Q_{cv} = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\dot{Q}_{cv} dt$ is the total heat transfer we need to find.\n\n**4. Apply Process and State Properties**\n\n-   **Initial State (1):** The tank is evacuated, so $m_{cv,1} = 0$. This implies $(m_{cv}u_{cv})_1 = 0$.\n-   **Inlet Conditions:** The supply line conditions are constant, so the specific enthalpy of the incoming gas, $h_{in}$, is constant throughout the process. $h_{in} = h_{line}$.\n-   **Isothermal Constraint:** The temperature of the gas in the tank is constant and equal to the line temperature: $T_{tank} = T_{line}$. Therefore, the specific internal energy of the gas in the tank is also constant: $u_{cv} = u_{line}$.\n-   **Final State (2):** The final mass in the tank is $m_{cv,2}$ and its specific internal energy is $u_{cv,2} = u(T_{line})$.\n\nThe integrated energy equation now becomes:\n$$\nm_{cv,2} u(T_{line}) - 0 = Q_{cv} + h(T_{line}) \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\dot{m}_{in} dt\n$$\nThe integral of the mass flow rate is the total mass that entered the tank, which is simply the final mass $m_{cv,2}$ since the tank started empty.\n$$\n\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\dot{m}_{in} dt = m_{cv,2} - m_{cv,1} = m_{cv,2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the energy equation:\n$$\nm_{cv,2} u(T_{line}) = Q_{cv} + m_{cv,2} h(T_{line})\n$$\n\n**5. Solve for the Total Heat Transfer, $Q_{cv}$**\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for $Q_{cv}$:\n$$\nQ_{cv} = m_{cv,2} u(T_{line}) - m_{cv,2} h(T_{line}) = m_{cv,2} (u - h)_{line}\n$$\nFor an ideal gas, enthalpy is defined as $h = u + Pv$, where $v$ is the specific volume. Using the ideal gas law $Pv = RT$, we have $h = u + RT$. Therefore, $u - h = -RT$.\nSubstituting this relationship (evaluated at $T_{line}$):\n$$\nQ_{cv} = m_{cv,2} (-R T_{line})\n$$\n\n**6. Determine the Final Mass, $m_{cv,2}$**\n\nThe filling process stops when the pressure in the tank, $P_f$, equals the line pressure, $P_{line}$. At this final state (2), we have:\n-   Pressure: $P_2 = P_{line}$\n-   Temperature: $T_2 = T_{tank} = T_{line}$\n-   Volume: $V$\nUsing the ideal gas law for the final state of the gas in the tank:\n$$\nP_2 V = m_{cv,2} R T_2\n$$\nSubstituting the known final conditions:\n$$\nP_{line} V = m_{cv,2} R T_{line}\n$$\nSolving for the final mass $m_{cv,2}$:\n$$\nm_{cv,2} = \\frac{P_{line} V}{R T_{line}}\n$$\n\n**7. Final Calculation**\n\nSubstitute the expression for $m_{cv,2}$ into our equation for $Q_{cv}$:\n$$\nQ_{cv} = -\\left(\\frac{P_{line} V}{R T_{line}}\\right) R T_{line}\n$$\nThe terms $R$ and $T_{line}$ cancel out, leaving a remarkably simple result:\n$$\nQ_{cv} = -P_{line} V\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that heat must be transferred *out of* the control volume (i.e., the gas must be cooled) to maintain the constant temperature. The amount of heat removed is equal to the product of the final pressure and the tank volume.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-P_{line}V}\n$$", "id": "540324"}, {"introduction": "The integral energy equation is often simplified using an average velocity, but this can be inaccurate for non-uniform flows.
