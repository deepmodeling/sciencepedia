This problem [@problem_id:454419] delves into the crucial concept of hydrodynamic stability by examining the classic Rayleigh-Taylor instability, but with a twist involving an elastic membrane.

Small perturbations at the interface grow, leading to the characteristic mixing of the two fluids. This instability can be suppressed at short wavelengths by surface tension, which acts to minimize the interfacial area.\n\nConsider a modified version of this classic problem where the interface is not a simple fluid-fluid boundary but is instead a thin, elastic membrane. This membrane possesses both an isotropic surface tension, $T$, and a bending rigidity, $B$. The system consists of two semi-infinite, immiscible, incompressible, and inviscid fluids.
