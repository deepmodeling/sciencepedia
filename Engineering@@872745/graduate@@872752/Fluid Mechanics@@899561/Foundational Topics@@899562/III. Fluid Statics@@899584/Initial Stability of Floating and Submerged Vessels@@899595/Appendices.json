The cylinder has a total height $H$ and a uniform radius $R$. It is constructed by stacking two cylindrical sections made of different materials. The bottom section has height $h_1$ and uniform density $\\rho_1$, while the top section has height $h_2$ and uniform density $\\rho_2$, such that $H = h_1 + h_2$.\n\nFor the purpose of analysis, define the following dimensionless parameters:\n- The overall aspect ratio of the cylinder, $\\Lambda = H/R$.\n- The height fraction of the bottom section, $\\alpha = h_1/H$.\n- The specific gravities of the two materials relative to the fluid, $\\sigma_1 = \\rho_1/\\rho_f$ and $\\sigma_2 = \\rho_2/\\rho_f$.\n\nIt is assumed that the average density of the cylinder is less than the fluid density, i.e., $\\rho_1 \\alpha + \\rho_2 (1-\\alpha) < \\rho_f$, ensuring that the cylinder floats with a portion of its height above the fluid surface.\n\nThe initial stability of the cylinder's vertical orientation is determined by its metacentric height, $GM$. The cylinder is stable if $GM > 0$, unstable if $GM < 0$, and neutrally stable if $GM = 0$.
