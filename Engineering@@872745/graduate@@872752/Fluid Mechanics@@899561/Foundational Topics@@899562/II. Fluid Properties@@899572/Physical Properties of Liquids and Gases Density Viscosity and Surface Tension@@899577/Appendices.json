This practice [@problem_id:1798407] challenges you to explore the limits of this continuum hypothesis by considering a gas flow at very small scales. By analyzing the role of the Knudsen number, you will develop a deeper physical intuition for why viscosity loses its meaning when molecular-level interactions with boundaries become as important as collisions between molecules themselves.", "problem": "In the field of microfluidics and the study of rarefied gases, the continuum hypothesis, which treats a fluid as a continuous medium, is not always valid. The validity of this hypothesis is assessed using the dimensionless Knudsen number, $Kn$, defined as the ratio of the molecular mean free path, $\\lambda$, to a characteristic physical length scale of the flow, $L$. For a gas flowing in a narrow channel of height $L$, the Knudsen number is $Kn = \\lambda/L$.\n\nThe principles of classical fluid mechanics, such as the Navier-Stokes equations, are based on the continuum hypothesis and are generally valid for flows with $Kn \\ll 1$. A key concept in this framework is the dynamic viscosity, $\\mu$, which for a Newtonian fluid relates the shear stress, $\\tau$, to the local velocity gradient, $\\frac{du}{dy}$, through the linear relation $\\tau = \\mu \\frac{du}{dy}$.\n\nConsider a scenario where the pressure of a gas flowing through a microchannel of fixed height $L$ is gradually lowered, causing the mean free path $\\lambda$ to increase. As the flow regime transitions to the point where $Kn \\approx 1$, the classical Newtonian definition of viscosity is observed to fail as an accurate descriptor of the gas's behavior.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental physical explanation for why the concept of dynamic viscosity, as defined above, loses its meaning in a flow where the Knudsen number approaches unity?\n\nA. The concept of viscosity relies on momentum exchange through frequent intermolecular collisions establishing a local bulk velocity. When the mean free path is comparable to the channel height, molecule-wall collisions begin to dominate over intermolecular collisions, invalidating the notion of distinct, locally-equilibrated fluid layers.\n\nB. At the small length scales where $Kn \\approx 1$, the flow inevitably becomes turbulent. The linear relationship between shear stress and velocity gradient is only valid for laminar flow, and thus viscosity is no longer a well-defined constant.\n\nC. The dimensions of the channel become comparable to the de Broglie wavelength of the gas molecules. This necessitates a quantum mechanical description of the fluid, in which classical concepts like viscosity are replaced by probabilistic wave functions.\n\nD. At the low pressures required to achieve a high Knudsen number, the ideal gas law breaks down. Since the kinetic theory derivation of viscosity depends on the assumptions of an ideal gas, the concept of viscosity becomes invalid.\n\nE. Gas surface tension effects, which are negligible in macroscopic flows, become the dominant force at the microscale. These forces pin gas molecules to the surfaces, preventing the formation of a velocity gradient and rendering viscosity irrelevant.", "solution": "Define the Knudsen number as $Kn=\\frac{\\lambda}{L}$, where $\\lambda$ is the molecular mean free path and $L$ is a characteristic macroscopic length (here, the channel height). The continuum (Navier–Stokes) framework assumes $Kn \\ll 1$, which implies a clear scale separation: many intermolecular collisions occur within the distance over which macroscopic fields (e.g., velocity $u(y)$) vary significantly. Under this condition, local thermodynamic equilibrium is established, and a local bulk velocity field is well-defined.\n\nIn the Newtonian constitutive law,\n$$\n\\tau=\\mu \\frac{du}{dy},\n$$\nthe shear stress $\\tau$ is assumed to be linearly related to the local velocity gradient, with $\\mu$ a material property independent of the local gradient. Microscopically, this law arises from momentum transport via frequent intermolecular collisions that diffuse momentum between adjacent fluid layers. In kinetic theory for a dilute gas, the dynamic viscosity scales as\n$$\n\\mu \\sim \\frac{1}{3}\\,\\rho\\,\\bar{c}\\,\\lambda,\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the mass density and $\\bar{c}$ is a characteristic thermal speed. Crucially, this relation and the derivation of the Newtonian law rely on local equilibrium and on the assumption that $\\lambda$ is much smaller than the gradient length scale, so that stress is determined by local gradients (via the Chapman–Enskog expansion, where Navier–Stokes corresponds to the first-order, $O(Kn)$ term and higher-order Burnett terms are $O(Kn^{2})$ and beyond).\n\nAs pressure is lowered at fixed $L$, $\\lambda$ increases. When $Kn=\\frac{\\lambda}{L}\\approx 1$, the mean free path becomes comparable to the channel height. Then:\n- Molecules travel distances of order $L$ between collisions, so intermolecular collisions no longer dominate momentum transport within the channel; molecule–wall interactions become comparably or more frequent.\n- The assumption of locally equilibrated fluid layers with a well-defined local bulk velocity and local gradient $\\frac{du}{dy}$ breaks down, because momentum transfer becomes nonlocal; the stress is determined by the full velocity distribution $f(\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{v},t)$ governed by the Boltzmann equation,\n$$\n\\partial_{t} f+\\boldsymbol{v}\\cdot\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{x}} f+\\boldsymbol{a}\\cdot\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{v}} f=\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}\\right)_{\\mathrm{coll}},\n$$\nnot by a local gradient alone. The shear stress,\n$$\n\\tau_{xy}=\\int m\\,c_{x}\\,c_{y}\\,f\\,d^{3}v,\n$$\nis no longer proportional to a local $\\frac{du}{dy}$ with a constant $\\mu$; instead, it depends on nonlocal boundary effects (e.g., wall accommodation) and the structure of Knudsen layers.\n\nTherefore, the Newtonian notion of viscosity as a local proportionality constant between $\\tau$ and $\\frac{du}{dy}$ loses its meaning when $Kn\\approx 1$ because the physical mechanism it summarizes—diffusive momentum exchange through frequent intermolecular collisions setting a local equilibrium—no longer applies; molecule–wall collisions and ballistic transport dominate and invalidate the concept of distinct, locally equilibrated fluid layers.\n\nEliminating the incorrect options:\n- B is incorrect because turbulence is not implied by $Kn\\approx 1$; at low pressures, the Reynolds number $Re=\\frac{\\rho U L}{\\mu}$ is typically small, so flows remain laminar. The breakdown is due to rarefaction/nonlocality, not turbulence.\n- C is incorrect because the relevant quantum de Broglie wavelength $\\lambda_{dB}\\sim \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2\\pi m k_{B} T}}$ is far smaller than microchannel dimensions at typical temperatures; quantum mechanics is not the cause.\n- D is incorrect because the ideal gas law $p=\\rho R T$ is more accurate at low pressures; moreover, while kinetic theory uses idealizations, the invalidation near $Kn\\approx 1$ stems from the breakdown of local equilibrium and locality, not from the failure of $p=\\rho R T$.\n- E is incorrect because surface tension pertains to fluid–fluid interfaces; in a gas–solid system with a single gas phase, “gas surface tension” does not dominate momentum transport. Wall interactions matter via accommodation and slip, not via surface tension pinning.\n\nThus, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is that viscosity as a local diffusive closure fails because the mean free path is comparable to the flow scale, so intermolecular collisions can no longer establish local equilibrium and molecule–wall interactions dominate, invalidating the Newtonian constitutive law.
