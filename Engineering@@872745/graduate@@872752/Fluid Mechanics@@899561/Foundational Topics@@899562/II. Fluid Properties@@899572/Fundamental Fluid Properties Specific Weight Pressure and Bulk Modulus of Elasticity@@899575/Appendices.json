This field is the vector sum of the true gravitational acceleration ($\\mathbf{g} = -g\\mathbf{j}$) and the inertial acceleration due to the frame's motion ($-a\\mathbf{i}$). The effective gravitational acceleration is therefore:\n    $$ \\mathbf{g}_{\\text{eff}} = -a\\mathbf{i} - g\\mathbf{j} $$\n2.  **Hydrostatic Equilibrium:** For a fluid in a static equilibrium in this frame, the pressure gradient $\\nabla P$ must balance the effective body force per unit volume:\n    $$ \\nabla P = \\rho \\mathbf{g}_{\\text{eff}} $$\n3.  **Orientation of Isobaric Surfaces:** Surfaces of constant pressure (isobars) are always perpendicular to the pressure gradient vector, $\\nabla P$.

This exercise delves into the world of capillarity, where surface tension creates pressure differences across curved surfaces, as described by the Young-Laplace equation. You will derive the equilibrium height of a liquid in a conical tube by balancing this capillary pressure against the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid column, a fundamental skill for analyzing microfluidics and wetting phenomena [@problem_id:524136].", "problem": "A liquid with density $\\rho$ and surface tension $\\sigma$ is contained in a large open reservoir. A narrow, vertically oriented conical tube, with its tip pointing downwards, is lowered into the reservoir such that its tip is submerged. The liquid is observed to rise inside the conical tube due to capillary action. The tube geometry is defined by a constant half-angle $\\alpha$, which is the angle between the tube's wall and its vertical axis of symmetry. The liquid is perfectly wetting, meaning the contact angle between the liquid and the tube's inner wall is zero.\n\nAssuming the curved liquid surface (meniscus) inside the tube can be approximated as a spherical cap, derive an expression for the equilibrium height $h$ to which the liquid rises. This height $h$ is measured from the level of the free surface in the reservoir to the three-phase (solid-liquid-gas) contact line, and should be expressed as a function of the local radius $r$ of the tube at that contact line. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the equilibrium height $h$ of a liquid in a conical tube as a function of the local radius $r$. The equilibrium is established by a balance between the hydrostatic pressure of the liquid column and the capillary pressure across the curved meniscus.\n\n1.  **Hydrostatic Pressure Balance:**\n    The pressure inside the liquid at a depth $h$ below the meniscus is higher than the pressure just below the meniscus by $\\rho g h$. The pressure just below the meniscus is $p_{liquid}$, and the pressure at the level of the external free surface is the atmospheric pressure, $p_{atm}$. Therefore, the pressure difference that supports the column of height $h$ is given by the hydrostatic pressure equation:\n    $$\n    \\Delta p = p_{atm} - p_{liquid} = \\rho g h\n    $$\n\n2.  **Capillary Pressure (Young-Laplace Equation):**\n    The pressure difference across a curved liquid-gas interface is given by the Young-Laplace equation:\n    $$\n    \\Delta p = \\sigma \\left( \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} \\right)\n    $$\n    where $\\sigma$ is the surface tension and $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the principal radii of curvature of the surface.

This implies that the liquid surface is tangent to the solid wall at the contact line.\n    \n    Let's analyze the geometry in a 2D cross-section through the cone's axis. The cone wall is a straight line making an angle $\\alpha$ with the vertical axis. The normal to this wall therefore makes an angle $\\alpha$ with the horizontal axis.\n\n    Since the contact angle is zero, the meniscus (a spherical cap) is tangent to the cone wall at the contact line. This means the normal to the meniscus surface at the contact line is identical to the normal to the cone wall.\n    \n    The center of the spherical cap must lie on the axis of symmetry (the vertical axis) due to the axisymmetry of the problem. Let the contact line be at a radius $r$ and height $h$. Let the center of the sphere of which the meniscus is a part be at a coordinate $(0, z_c)$ in a coordinate system where the horizontal axis is at height $h$. The contact point is at $(r, 0)$. The radius of curvature $R_c$ is the distance from the center $(0, z_c)$ to the contact point $(r, 0)$.\n    $$\n    R_c^2 = (r-0)^2 + (0 - z_c)^2 = r^2 + z_c^2\n    $$\n    The vector normal to the spherical surface at $(r, 0)$ points from the surface point towards the center of curvature, i.e., it is in the direction of the vector from $(r,0)$ to $(0, z_c)$, which is $(-r, z_c)$. The angle $\\beta$ that this normal vector makes with the horizontal is given by $\\tan \\beta = |z_c / (-r)| = |z_c|/r$.\n    \n    As established, this normal direction must be the same as the wall's normal direction.
