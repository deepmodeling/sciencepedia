Initially, the fluid and the plate are at rest. At time $t=0$, an infinitely long strip on the plate, defined by $-\\infty < x < \\infty$ and $-L \\le y \\le L$, is suddenly accelerated to a constant velocity $U$ in the positive $x$-direction. The parts of the plate outside this strip ($|y| > L$) remain stationary. The resulting fluid motion is purely in the $x$-direction, such that the velocity field is of the form $\\mathbf{v} = u(y,z,t)\\mathbf{\\hat{i}}$. After a sufficiently long time, the flow evolves to a steady state described by the velocity field $u_{ss}(y,z) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} u(y,z,t)$. Assuming no externally imposed pressure gradients, derive the expression for this steady-state velocity profile $u_{ss}(y,z)$.", "solution": "The governing equations for a viscous, incompressible fluid are the Navier-Stokes equations:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{v} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the velocity field is of the form $\\mathbf{v} = u(y,z,t)\\mathbf{\\hat{i}}$. Let's analyze the implications for the governing equations.\n\n1.  **Continuity Equation:**\n    $$\n    \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0\n    $$\n    This implies that $u$ is not a function of $x$, so $u = u(y,z,t)$, which is consistent with the problem statement.\n\n2.  **Momentum Equation (Navier-Stokes):**\n    The convective acceleration term is:\n    $$\n    (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{v} = \\left(u \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right) (u\\mathbf{\\hat{i}}) = u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\mathbf{\\hat{i}} = 0\n    $$\n    The problem also states that there are no externally imposed pressure gradients. Since the flow is driven solely by the boundary motion and is uniform in the $x$-direction, we can assume that the pressure $p$ is constant throughout the fluid, so $\\nabla p = 0$.\n\n    The Navier-Stokes vector equation then simplifies to:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial (u\\mathbf{\\hat{i}})}{\\partial t} = \\nu \\nabla^2(u\\mathbf{\\hat{i}})\n    $$\n    Considering only the $x$-component (since other components are zero), and noting that $u$ depends only on $y, z, t$, we get the 2D diffusion (or heat) equation:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\nu \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2} \\right)\n    $$\n\n3.  **Steady-State Solution:**\n    The problem asks for the steady-state velocity profile $u_{ss}(y,z) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} u(y,z,t)$. In the steady state, the time derivative vanishes, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial u_{ss}}{\\partial t} = 0$. The governing equation for the steady-state flow is therefore Laplace's equation in 2D:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial^2 u_{ss}}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u_{ss}}{\\partial z^2} = 0\n    $$\n    The boundary conditions for $u_{ss}(y,z)$ are derived from the physical constraints of the problem:\n    -   At the plate ($z=0$):\n        -   $u_{ss}(y,0) = U$ for $|y| \\le L$\n        -   $u_{ss}(y,0) = 0$ for $|y| > L$\n    -   Far from the plate (as $z \\to \\infty$): $u_{ss}(y,z) \\to 0$\n    -   Far from the strip (as $|y| \\to \\infty$): $u_{ss}(y,z) \\to 0$\n\n4.  **Solving Laplace's Equation using Fourier Transform:**\n    We solve this boundary value problem using the Fourier transform with respect to the $y$ coordinate. Let $\\tilde{u}_{ss}(k,z) = \\mathcal{F}\\{u_{ss}(y,z)\\} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u_{ss}(y,z) e^{-iky} dy$.\n    Transforming Laplace's equation:\n    $$\n    \\mathcal{F}\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial^2 u_{ss}}{\\partial y^2}\\right\\} + \\mathcal{F}\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial^2 u_{ss}}{\\partial z^2}\\right\\} = 0\n    $$\n    $$\n    (ik)^2 \\tilde{u}_{ss}(k,z) + \\frac{d^2 \\tilde{u}_{ss}}{dz^2} = 0\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\frac{d^2 \\tilde{u}_{ss}}{dz^2} - k^2 \\tilde{u}_{ss} = 0\n    $$\n    This is a second-order ordinary differential equation for $\\tilde{u}_{ss}$ as a function of $z$. The general solution is:\n    $$\n    \\tilde{u}_{ss}(k,z) = A(k)e^{|k|z} + B(k)e^{-|k|z}\n    $$\n    We use $|k|$ instead of $k$ to ensure the solutions are real and decaying for $z>0$ regardless of the sign of $k$.\n    The boundary condition $u_{ss}(y,z) \\to 0$ as $z \\to \\infty$ implies that $\\tilde{u}_{ss}(k,z) \\to 0$ as $z \\to \\infty$. This requires $A(k)=0$.\n    Thus, the solution in the Fourier domain is:\n    $$\n    \\tilde{u}_{ss}(k,z) = B(k)e^{-|k|z}\n    $$\n    To find $B(k)$, we use the boundary condition at $z=0$. Setting $z=0$ gives $\\tilde{u}_{ss}(k,0) = B(k)$. We compute $\\tilde{u}_{ss}(k,0)$ by taking the Fourier transform of $u_{ss}(y,0)$:\n    $$\n    \\tilde{u}_{ss}(k,0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u_{ss}(y,0)e^{-iky}dy = \\int_{-L}^{L} U e^{-iky} dy = U \\left[ \\frac{e^{-iky}}{-ik} \\right]_{-L}^{L}\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\tilde{u}_{ss}(k,0) = U \\left( \\frac{e^{-ikL} - e^{ikL}}{-ik} \\right) = U \\left( \\frac{-2i\\sin(kL)}{-ik} \\right) = \\frac{2U\\sin(kL)}{k}\n    $$\n    So, $B(k) = \\frac{2U\\sin(kL)}{k}$. The solution in the Fourier domain is:\n    $$\n    \\tilde{u}_{ss}(k,z) = \\frac{2U\\sin(kL)}{k}e^{-|k|z}\n    $$\n\n5.  **Inverse Fourier Transform:**\n    Now we find $u_{ss}(y,z)$ by performing the inverse Fourier transform:\n    $$\n    u_{ss}(y,z) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\tilde{u}_{ss}(k,z) e^{iky} dk = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{2U\\sin(kL)}{k}e^{-|k|z} e^{iky} dk\n    $$\n    $$\n    u_{ss}(y,z) = \\frac{U}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin(kL)}{k} e^{-|k|z} (\\cos(ky) + i\\sin(ky)) dk\n    $$\n    The integral can be split into real and imaginary parts. The term with $\\sin(ky)$ results in an odd integrand (since $\\sin(kL)/k$ is even and $\\sin(ky)$ is odd), so its integral over $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ is zero. We are left with the real part:\n    $$\n    u_{ss}(y,z) = \\frac{U}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin(kL)\\cos(ky)}{k} e^{-|k|z} dk\n    $$\n    The integrand is an even function of $k$, so we can write the integral as twice the integral from $0$ to $\\infty$:\n    $$\n    u_{ss}(y,z) = \\frac{2U}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin(kL)\\cos(ky)}{k} e^{-kz} dk\n    $$\n    Using the trigonometric identity $\\sin(A)\\cos(B) = \\frac{1}{2}[\\sin(A+B) + \\sin(A-B)]$:\n    $$\n    u_{ss}(y,z) = \\frac{2U}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}[\\sin(k(L+y)) + \\sin(k(L-y))]}{k} e^{-kz} dk\n    $$\n    $$\n    u_{ss}(y,z) = \\frac{U}{\\pi} \\left[ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin(k(L+y))}{k} e^{-kz} dk + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin(k(L-y))}{k} e^{-kz} dk \\right]\n    $$\n    We use the known definite integral result:\n    $$\n    \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin(ak)}{k} e^{-bk} dk = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)\n    $$\n    Applying this formula to both integrals, with $b=z$, and $a_1 = L+y$, $a_2 = L-y$:\n    $$\n    u_{ss}(y,z) = \\frac{U}{\\pi} \\left[ \\arctan\\left(\\frac{L+y}{z}\\right) + \\arctan\\left(\\frac{L-y}{z}\\right) \\right]\n    $$\n    This is the final expression for the steady-state velocity profile.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{U}{\\pi} \\left[ \\arctan\\left(\\frac{L+y}{z}\\right) + \\arctan\\left(\\frac{L-y}{z}\\right) \\right]}\n$$", "id": "505299"}, {"introduction": "The standard analysis of an oscillating plate often assumes a simple sinusoidal motion.
