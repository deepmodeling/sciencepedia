The standard result from literature is that the first-order correction to the wavenumber is $\\Delta k = (\\omega/c_0^2) \\langle U \\rangle$ where $\\langle U \\rangle$ is the average of the flow profile weighted by the squared acoustic pressure of the unperturbed mode.\n$$\\Delta k_n = \\frac{\\omega}{c_0^2} \\frac{\\int U(y) (\\hat{p}^{(n,0)})^2 dy}{\\int (\\hat{p}^{(n,0)})^2 dy}$$\nAh, but the group velocity of the unperturbed mode, $v_g^{(0)} = c_0^2 k^{(0)}/\\omega$, matters.
