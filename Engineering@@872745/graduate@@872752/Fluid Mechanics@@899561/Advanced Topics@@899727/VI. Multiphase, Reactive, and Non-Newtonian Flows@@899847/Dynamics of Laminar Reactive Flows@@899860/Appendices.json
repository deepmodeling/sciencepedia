The speed at which it propagates normal to itself, relative to the unburnt gas, is the laminar flame speed, $S_L$.\n\nIn non-uniform flows, a flame front is subjected to stretching, which can alter its propagation speed. For many flames, the stretched flame speed, $S_d$, is linearly related to the stretch rate, $K$, by the formula:\n$$S_d = S_L - \\mathcal{L} K$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}$ is the Markstein length, a positive constant that quantifies the flame's sensitivity to stretch. A positive Markstein length implies that a flame subjected to positive (stretching) stretch rates will burn slower, while it will burn faster under negative (compressive) stretch rates.

A long, planar flame front is placed in this flow. A stationary configuration for this flame is possible along the streamline $y=0$, where the flow velocity is zero. For the flame to be stationary at this location, the stretched flame speed $S_d$ must be zero, placing the flame on the verge of extinction.\n\nAssuming the flame front is a straight line making an angle $\\alpha$ with the positive x-axis, such that $0  \\alpha  \\pi/2$, derive an expression for this extinction angle $\\alpha$ in terms of the laminar flame speed $S_L$, the shear rate $\\kappa$, and the Markstein length $\\mathcal{L}$.", "solution": "We seek the angle α at which the stretched flame speed \n$$S_d = S_L - \\mathcal{L}\\,K$$\nvanishes, with the stretch rate \n$$K = -\\,\\mathbf{n}\\cdot(\\nabla\\mathbf{u})\\cdot\\mathbf{n}.$$\n1.
