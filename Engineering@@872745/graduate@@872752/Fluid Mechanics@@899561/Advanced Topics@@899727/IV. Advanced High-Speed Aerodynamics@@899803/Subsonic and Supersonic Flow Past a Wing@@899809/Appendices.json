R. T. Jones' slender-body theory offers a powerful alternative by relating the three-dimensional steady flow over the wing to a simpler two-dimensional unsteady flow in cross-flow planes. This practice challenges you to apply this elegant theory to derive the induced drag for a gothic planform wing, a key performance metric. The derivation reveals a surprisingly universal relationship between the induced drag factor and aspect ratio for this class of wings, highlighting the profound insights that can be gained from simplified theoretical models [@problem_id:609258].", "problem": "This problem explores the aerodynamic characteristics of a low-aspect-ratio wing using R. T. Jones' slender-body theory. In this theory, the three-dimensional steady flow past a slender wing is related to a two-dimensional unsteady flow in cross-flow planes.\n\n**Theoretical Background:**\nConsider a thin, flat wing placed in a uniform incompressible flow of density $\\rho_\\infty$ and velocity $U_\\infty$. The wing is at a small angle of attack $\\alpha$. According to Jones' theory, the flow in a plane perpendicular to the freestream (a cross-flow plane) can be analyzed as a 2D flow created by the wing's cross-section. For a small angle of attack, the cross-section, with a local span of $b(x)$, effectively moves downwards with a velocity $W=U_\\infty\\alpha$.\n\nThe sectional lift (lift per unit span), $l(x)$, generated by the wing is related to the rate of change of the fluid's momentum in the cross-flow plane. The vertical impulse per unit length of the fluid is $I_z(x) = m_a(x) W$, where $m_a(x)$ is the added mass per unit length of the 2D cross-section. The sectional lift is given by the time rate of change of this impulse, where time is related to the downstream distance by $t=x/U_\\infty$.
