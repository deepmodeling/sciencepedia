This flow enters a two-dimensional, symmetric converging duct. The duct's entrance is at $x=0$, where the walls are located at a distance $H$ from the centerline, i.e., at $y = \\pm H$. For $x>0$, the walls are straight and converge towards the centerline. The upper wall is described by the equation $y = H - x \\tan\\theta_w$ and the lower wall by $y = -H + x \\tan\\theta_w$, where $\\theta_w$ is the small convergence angle of the walls ($\\theta_w \\ll 1$).\n\nAt the corners where the convergence begins, located at $(0, H)$ and $(0, -H)$, two symmetric oblique shock waves are generated. These shocks propagate into the uniform flow inside the duct. Due to the symmetry of the configuration, these two shock waves will eventually intersect on the duct's centerline ($y=0$).\n\nThe analysis of such flows is simplified in the hypersonic small-disturbance limit, where $M_1 \\to \\infty$ and $\\theta_w \\to 0$ such that the hypersonic similarity parameter $K = M_1\\theta_w$ remains a quantity of order one.
