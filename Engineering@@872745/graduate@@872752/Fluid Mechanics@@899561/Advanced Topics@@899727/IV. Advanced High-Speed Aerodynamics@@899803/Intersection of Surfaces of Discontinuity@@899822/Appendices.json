The state of the gas can be described by its pressure $p$, density $\\rho$, and velocity $u$. The local speed of sound is given by $c = \\sqrt{\\gamma p / \\rho}$. For one-dimensional isentropic flow, two Riemann invariants exist, which are constant along characteristic curves $dx/dt = u \\pm c$. For a simple wave (like a rarefaction wave) propagating to the right, the Riemann invariant $I_{-} = u - \\frac{2c}{\\gamma-1}$ is constant throughout the flow, while for a wave propagating to the left, $I_{+} = u + \\frac{2c}{\\gamma-1}$ is constant. Additionally, for an isentropic process, the relation $p/\\rho^\\gamma = \\text{constant}$ holds.\n\nConsider two semi-infinite regions of this ideal gas, initially in different uniform states, occupying the domains $x0$ (State 2) and $x>0$ (State 3) respectively.

This new state, State 5, is created by the interaction of two initial states, State 2 and State 3. The key principle is that the pressure and velocity must be continuous across the contact surface that (in principle) separates the gas originating from region 2 and region 3. Since the final state is uniform, this means there is a single pressure $p_5$ and a single velocity $u_5$ in the region between the two rarefaction waves.\n\nWe can find the velocity $u_5$ by considering each rarefaction wave separately and then equating the results.\n\n**1.

Let's collect terms involving $p_5$ on one side and all other terms on the other.
