The state of this gas is described by its pressure $p$, specific volume $v$, and a relaxation parameter $q$. The specific internal energy $e$ of the gas is given by the sum of two components: a \"frozen\" component, corresponding to the energy in the translational and rotational modes, and a \"relaxation\" component, corresponding to the energy stored in the relaxing internal modes.\n\nThe frozen component is modeled as that of a perfect gas:\n$$e_f = \\frac{pv}{\\gamma_f - 1}$$\nwhere $\\gamma_f$ is the ratio of specific heats for the frozen modes. The relaxation component is given by $e_{rel} = qD$, where $D$ is the characteristic energy of relaxation per unit mass. Thus, the total specific internal energy is $e = e_f + e_{rel} = \\frac{pv}{\\gamma_f - 1} + qD$.\n\nA stationary normal shock wave propagates through this gas. The upstream state, far ahead of the shock, is a quiescent equilibrium state $(p_1, v_1)$ with the relaxation parameter at its ground value, $q_1 = 0$.\n\nThe shock compresses the gas to a final specific volume $v_2  v_1$. We consider two distinct states downstream of the shock front:\n\n1.  **The Frozen State:** Immediately behind the shock discontinuity, the gas is compressed to a state $(p_F, v_2)$. The relaxation process is too slow to have occurred, so the relaxation parameter remains \"frozen\" at its upstream value, i.e., $q_F = q_1 = 0$. This state lies on the *frozen Hugoniot*.\n\n2.  **The Equilibrium State:** Far downstream of the shock, the gas has had sufficient time to reach a new thermodynamic equilibrium at state $(p_E, v_2)$. In this equilibrium state, the energy stored in the relaxation modes is found to be directly proportional to the thermal energy of the frozen modes, governed by the relation:\n    $$q_E D = \\alpha e_f(p_E, v_2)$$\n    where $\\alpha$ is a positive, dimensionless constant that characterizes the equilibrium state. This state lies on the *equilibrium Hugoniot*.\n\nThe relationship between the states on either side of a shock is described by the Rankine-Hugoniot equation for internal energy:\n$$e_2 - e_1 = \\frac{1}{2}(p_2 + p_1)(v_1 - v_2)$$\n\nDerive an expression for the pressure difference $\\Delta p = p_F - p_E$ between the frozen and equilibrium states at the specified final specific volume $v_2$.

However, in certain complex fluids known as Bethe-Zel'dovich-Thompson (BZT) fluids, it is possible to have $c_e  c_f$ in specific thermodynamic regions.
