The pressure and dynamic pressure of the freestream are $p_1$ and $q_1$, respectively.\n\nThe adverse pressure gradient imposed by the shock causes the laminar boundary layer on the plate to separate. This phenomenon alters the reflection characteristics of the shock. A simplified model for this shock-boundary-layer interaction is adopted, with the following assumptions:\n1.  The separated boundary layer creates an effective ramp on the wall, with a small angle $\\theta_w$.\n2.  The angle of this effective ramp is linearly proportional to the pressure coefficient of the incident shock, $C_p^{inc} = (p_2 - p_1) / q_1$, where $p_2$ is the pressure downstream of the incident shock. The relationship is given by $\\theta_w = B \\cdot C_p^{inc}$, where $B$ is a given positive dimensionless constant that characterizes the boundary layer's response.\n3.  The incident shock reflects off this effective ramp. The flow downstream of the reflected shock must be parallel to the ramp's surface.\n4.  The entire interaction can be analyzed using linearized supersonic theory (also known as Ackeret theory), valid for small deflection angles.\n5.
