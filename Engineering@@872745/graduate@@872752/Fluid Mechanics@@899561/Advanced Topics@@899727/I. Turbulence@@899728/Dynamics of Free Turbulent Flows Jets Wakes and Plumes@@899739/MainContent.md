## Introduction
Free turbulent flows—such as jets, wakes, and plumes—are a [fundamental class](@entry_id:158335) of [fluid motion](@entry_id:182721) found throughout nature and engineered systems. Their behavior dictates processes ranging from [pollutant dispersion](@entry_id:195534) in the atmosphere to the efficiency of industrial combustors. Despite their apparent complexity, a unifying theoretical framework built on conservation laws and scaling principles allows for their systematic analysis. This article provides a comprehensive exploration of these dynamics. We will begin in the "Principles and Mechanisms" chapter by dissecting the core physical laws that govern these flows, including conservation principles, the concept of self-similarity, and the crucial mechanism of entrainment. Subsequently, the "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" chapter will demonstrate how these foundational theories are applied to solve real-world problems in [aerodynamics](@entry_id:193011), environmental science, and geophysics. Finally, the "Hands-On Practices" section offers a chance to engage with these concepts through targeted problem-solving, solidifying the connection between theory and application.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Free turbulent flows, such as jets, wakes, and plumes, represent a [fundamental class](@entry_id:158335) of [fluid motion](@entry_id:182721) ubiquitous in both natural and engineered systems. Unconstrained by solid boundaries, their dynamics are governed by the turbulent exchange of momentum, heat, and mass with the surrounding fluid. This chapter elucidates the core principles and mechanisms that dictate their behavior, focusing on the concepts of conservation laws, [self-similarity](@entry_id:144952), and entrainment, which together provide a powerful framework for their analysis.

### Fundamental Entities: Jets, Wakes, and Plumes

At the most basic level, we can classify free shear flows by their source.

A **jet** is formed when a fluid is ejected from an orifice into a larger body of the same or a different fluid. Its primary characteristic is its **[momentum flux](@entry_id:199796)**, a quantity that, in the absence of external forces, is conserved along the jet's trajectory.

A **wake** is the region of disturbed flow downstream of a solid body immersed in a fluid stream. In contrast to a jet, which has an excess of momentum relative to its surroundings, a wake is characterized by a **momentum deficit**. The magnitude of this deficit is intrinsically linked to the drag force exerted by the fluid on the body.

A **plume** is generated by a source of [buoyancy](@entry_id:138985), such as a heat source that lowers the density of the surrounding fluid, causing it to rise. While a plume may have some initial momentum (in which case it is often called a [buoyant jet](@entry_id:275883) or forced plume), its far-field behavior is dominated by the continuous generation of momentum by the [buoyancy force](@entry_id:154088).

These [canonical flows](@entry_id:188303) share a common feature: they grow and evolve by mixing with the ambient fluid. This process is inherently turbulent and leads to the development of characteristic structures and scaling laws.

### Conservation Laws as Organizing Principles

The behavior of free shear flows is profoundly constrained by the fundamental conservation laws of physics. For high-Reynolds-number turbulent flows, the integral forms of these laws provide robust relationships that govern the flow's large-scale evolution, irrespective of the fine details of the turbulence.

#### Momentum Conservation in Jets

For a jet issuing into a quiescent environment, the total flux of momentum across any plane perpendicular to the jet axis must remain constant, equal to the momentum flux at the source. This principle holds because there are no external forces acting on the fluid in the streamwise direction (ignoring gravity for a horizontal jet).

Let us consider, for example, a two-dimensional, incompressible [turbulent jet](@entry_id:271164) emerging from a line source. In the [far-field](@entry_id:269288), the flow organizes into a [self-similar](@entry_id:274241) state, where the streamwise [mean velocity](@entry_id:150038) $u(x,y)$ can be described by a characteristic velocity scale that decays with downstream distance $x$, and a shape function that depends on a similarity variable. A common approximation for this profile is a Gaussian function:
$$
u(x,y) = \frac{A}{\sqrt{x}} \exp\left(-\frac{y^2}{B^2 x^2}\right)
$$
where $A$ and $B$ are constants related to the jet's strength and spreading rate. The kinematic [momentum flux](@entry_id:199796) per unit span, $J$, is defined as the integral of the velocity squared:
$$
J = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} u(x,y)^2 \, dy
$$
Substituting the self-similar profile into this definition, we obtain:
$$
J = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left( \frac{A}{\sqrt{x}} \exp\left(-\frac{y^2}{B^2 x^2}\right) \right)^2 \, dy = \frac{A^2}{x} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp\left(-\frac{2y^2}{B^2 x^2}\right) \, dy
$$
This is a standard Gaussian integral. By performing the integration (for instance, with the substitution $z = \sqrt{2}y / (Bx)$), the integral evaluates to $\sqrt{\pi/2} Bx$. The final result for the momentum flux is:
$$
J = \frac{A^2}{x} \left( \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}} Bx \right) = A^2 B \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}
$$
Crucially, the dependence on the downstream coordinate $x$ has vanished. This demonstrates that a flow field described by this self-similar form inherently satisfies the conservation of momentum flux, a foundational principle of jet dynamics [@problem_id:490454].

#### Momentum Deficit and Drag in Wakes

For a wake, the organizing principle is the conservation of the momentum deficit. The drag force $D$ exerted by a [uniform flow](@entry_id:272775) on a stationary body is removed from the fluid. This momentum "loss" is carried downstream within the wake. Using a [control volume analysis](@entry_id:154003), one can establish a direct and exact relationship between the drag force and the integral of the momentum deficit in the far-wake.

Consider a two-dimensional body in a stream of uniform velocity $U_\infty$ and density $\rho$. The body exerts a drag force $D$ per unit span on the fluid. Far downstream, where the pressure has recovered to the ambient pressure, the velocity profile $u(y)$ shows a defect relative to the freestream. The **[momentum flux](@entry_id:199796) deficit**, $M$, is defined as:
$$
M = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \rho u(y) (U_\infty - u(y)) dy
$$
This quantity represents the difference between the momentum flux that would exist in a uniform stream and the actual momentum flux in the wake profile, corrected for the mass flux deficit in the wake. By applying the integral form of the [momentum equation](@entry_id:197225) to a large [control volume](@entry_id:143882) enclosing the body and extending into the far-wake, it can be rigorously shown that the [net force](@entry_id:163825) on the fluid is precisely balanced by the net outflow of momentum deficit. The result is one of the most elegant in [fluid mechanics](@entry_id:152498) [@problem_id:490343]:
$$
D = M
$$
This relationship, known as the **momentum integral theorem for wakes**, is of immense practical and theoretical importance. It allows for the determination of the drag on an object by measuring the velocity profile in its wake, a technique commonly used in wind tunnel experiments. It also establishes the momentum deficit as the key conserved quantity governing the evolution of the far-wake.

#### Buoyancy Flux and Plumes

In buoyant flows, the [momentum flux](@entry_id:199796) is generally not conserved. For a plume rising in a quiescent environment, the [buoyancy force](@entry_id:154088) continuously acts on the fluid elements, accelerating them upwards. This acts as a distributed source of momentum. The conserved quantity in this case is the **[buoyancy flux](@entry_id:261821)**. For a source releasing fluid with density $\rho$ into an ambient fluid of density $\rho_a$, the kinematic [buoyancy flux](@entry_id:261821) is:
$$
F_0 = \int_A g \frac{\rho_a - \rho}{\rho_a} u \, dA
$$
where $g$ is the acceleration of gravity and the integral is taken over the source area $A$. Assuming the Boussinesq approximation holds and the density differences are small, this [buoyancy flux](@entry_id:261821) remains constant with height in an unstratified environment. The [momentum flux](@entry_id:199796), however, increases with height as $M(z) \propto F_0^{2/3} z^{4/3}$.

### The Mechanism of Growth: Entrainment and Self-Similarity

A defining characteristic of free shear flows is their ability to grow by engulfing and mixing with the surrounding, often irrotational, fluid. This process is known as **entrainment**.

#### The Entrainment Hypothesis

A powerful, albeit phenomenological, model for this process is the **[entrainment hypothesis](@entry_id:191683)**, first advanced by Morton, Taylor, and Turner. It postulates that the velocity at which ambient fluid is drawn across the turbulent/non-turbulent interface is proportional to a characteristic velocity of the turbulent flow itself. For a jet or plume, this characteristic velocity is typically the centerline velocity, $U(x)$. The entrainment velocity $v_e$ at the edge of the flow, of width $b(x)$, is thus modeled as:
$$
v_e = \alpha U(x)
$$
where $\alpha$ is a dimensionless **[entrainment](@entry_id:275487) coefficient**, an empirical constant that quantifies the efficiency of the mixing process.

We can use this hypothesis, in conjunction with [integral conservation laws](@entry_id:202878), to predict the growth of the flow. Let's analyze a turbulent round jet using a simplified "top-hat" profile, where the velocity is $U(x)$ for $r \le b(x)$ and zero otherwise. The conservation of [momentum flux](@entry_id:199796) $M_0 = \rho \pi U^2 b^2$ implies that $U b$ is constant. The mass flux is $Q(x) = \rho \pi U b^2$. The rate of change of mass flux must equal the rate of mass [entrainment](@entry_id:275487), $E = \rho (2\pi b) v_e = \rho (2\pi b) (\alpha U)$. Thus:
$$
\frac{d}{dx}(\rho \pi U b^2) = 2 \pi \rho \alpha U b
$$
By using the [momentum conservation](@entry_id:149964) constraint to relate derivatives of $U$ and $b$, this equation can be solved for the growth rate of the jet radius, $b(x)$. The result is remarkably simple [@problem_id:490416]:
$$
\frac{db}{dx} = 2\alpha
$$
This shows that the jet spreads linearly with downstream distance, a key experimental observation. The spreading rate is directly proportional to the [entrainment](@entry_id:275487) coefficient, highlighting [entrainment](@entry_id:275487) as the physical mechanism responsible for the flow's growth.

#### The Emergence of Self-Similarity

As a free shear flow evolves downstream, it tends to "forget" the specific details of its origin. A jet from a square orifice and one from a circular orifice will look nearly identical far downstream, provided their initial momentum fluxes are the same. This leads to the state of **self-similarity**, where the spatial structure of the mean flow quantities (like velocity) becomes independent of the downstream location when scaled by appropriate local length and velocity scales.

For example, the velocity defect in a wake, $U_\infty - u(x,y)$, can be written as:
$$
U_\infty - u(x,y) = U_s(x) f(\eta), \quad \text{with} \quad \eta = \frac{y}{\delta(x)}
$$
Here, $U_s(x)$ is the centerline velocity defect and $\delta(x)$ is the wake width. These scales evolve with $x$ according to [power laws](@entry_id:160162) (e.g., for a 2D wake, $U_s \propto x^{-1/2}$ and $\delta \propto x^{1/2}$), but the function $f(\eta)$, which describes the *shape* of the velocity profile, remains unchanged. This collapse of profiles onto a single universal curve is a hallmark of [self-similar](@entry_id:274241) flows and a powerful tool for their analysis.

### Turbulence, Mixing, and Transport

The processes of entrainment and momentum transfer are mediated by turbulence. The turbulent eddies, particularly the large-scale ones, are responsible for engulfing ambient fluid and transporting momentum across the flow.

#### Reynolds Stresses and Turbulent Diffusion

In a turbulent flow, the total shear stress is the sum of the [viscous stress](@entry_id:261328) and the **Reynolds shear stress**, $\tau_{uv} = -\rho \langle u'v' \rangle$, which arises from the correlation between streamwise ($u'$) and transverse ($v'$) velocity fluctuations. In free shear flows, the Reynolds stress typically dominates the [viscous stress](@entry_id:261328).

A simple model for the Reynolds stress is the **Boussinesq eddy-viscosity hypothesis**, which mimics the form of viscous stress:
$$
-\langle u'v' \rangle = \nu_T \frac{\partial \langle u \rangle}{\partial y}
$$
Here, $\nu_T$ is the **[eddy viscosity](@entry_id:155814)**, which is a property of the flow, not the fluid, and is generally not constant. However, for far-wakes, it is a reasonable approximation to consider $\nu_T$ as constant across the wake profile.

This model can be used to connect the mean flow field to the turbulence structure. If we take the [self-similar](@entry_id:274241) Gaussian profile for the velocity defect in a 2D wake, $\langle u \rangle = U_\infty - U_s(x) \exp(-\alpha \eta^2)$, we can calculate the mean [velocity gradient](@entry_id:261686) and subsequently the Reynolds stress [@problem_id:490464]. The resulting profile for $\langle u'v' \rangle$ is also [self-similar](@entry_id:274241). After finding its maximum value, we can define a normalized Reynolds stress profile that depends only on the similarity variable $\eta$:
$$
\tau_{norm}(\eta) = \frac{\langle u'v' \rangle}{\max_{y}|\langle u'v' \rangle|} = \sqrt{2\alpha e} \eta \exp(-\alpha\eta^2)
$$
This demonstrates an important consequence of [self-similarity](@entry_id:144952): if the [mean field](@entry_id:751816) is [self-similar](@entry_id:274241), then the primary turbulent statistics, such as the Reynolds stresses, also adopt a self-similar form. The stress is zero at the centerline (by symmetry), peaks at an off-axis location where the mean [velocity gradient](@entry_id:261686) is large, and decays to zero in the freestream.

#### Scalar Transport and Fluctuation Intensity

When a free shear flow transports a passive scalar, such as temperature or a pollutant concentration, turbulence is the primary agent of mixing. The intensity of the scalar fluctuations, often characterized by the **scalar variance**, $\overline{c'^2}$, is a measure of the degree of mixing. A high variance indicates poor mixing, with large excursions from the mean concentration.

The evolution of scalar variance is governed by a [transport equation](@entry_id:174281) involving terms for production, dissipation, and transport. In the self-similar [far-field](@entry_id:269288) of a jet, analysis shows that the production of scalar variance (which is proportional to the turbulent scalar flux and the mean concentration gradient) is balanced by its dissipation rate (the rate at which molecular diffusion smooths out small-scale gradients) when integrated over the jet cross-section.

By adopting gradient-[diffusion models](@entry_id:142185) for the turbulent scalar flux and simple timescale arguments for the [dissipation rate](@entry_id:748577), one can analyze this balance [@problem_id:490441]. Using self-similar Gaussian profiles for both the mean concentration $\overline{C}$ and the variance $\overline{c'^2}$, this integral balance leads to a remarkable conclusion: the ratio of the centerline scalar variance to the square of the centerline mean concentration approaches a constant value.
$$
\frac{\overline{c'^2}_{CL}}{(\overline{C}_{CL})^2} = \text{constant}
$$
This implies that the relative intensity of the scalar fluctuations, $\sqrt{\overline{c'^2}_{CL}} / \overline{C}_{CL}$, is constant in the far-field. The jet becomes "statistically [self-similar](@entry_id:274241)," meaning not only the shape of the mean profile is constant, but the relative magnitude of the turbulent fluctuations is also constant.

### Complexities and Transitional Phenomena

While the idealized models of pure jets, wakes, and plumes provide a foundational understanding, many real-world flows involve transitions between different regimes or added complexities like swirl or non-circular geometries.

#### The Virtual Origin

Similarity solutions for jets are often derived assuming a [point source](@entry_id:196698) of momentum. Real jets, however, issue from finite-sized nozzles. Near the nozzle, there exists a **potential core** where the centerline velocity remains close to the exit velocity $U_0$. The flow only begins to resemble the [self-similar solution](@entry_id:173717) after this core, at a distance $x_c$. To reconcile the real flow with the idealized model, the concept of a **virtual origin**, $x_0$, is introduced. The far-field similarity law, e.g., $U_c(x) \propto 1/(x+x_0)$, is written with respect to an origin shifted upstream of the physical nozzle exit.

The location of this virtual origin can be determined by requiring that the far-field solution smoothly matches the flow at the end of the potential core. For a round jet, if we equate the potential core velocity $U_0$ with the [far-field](@entry_id:269288) scaling law at $x=x_c$, we can solve for $x_0$. This procedure links the virtual origin to the nozzle diameter $D$ and empirical constants describing the potential core length and the [far-field](@entry_id:269288) decay [@problem_id:490435]. The virtual origin is a crucial practical tool, allowing the simple and powerful [far-field](@entry_id:269288) scaling laws to be accurately applied to engineering problems.

#### Transitions Between Flow Regimes

Many flows exhibit characteristics of more than one canonical type.
A **[buoyant jet](@entry_id:275883)**, or forced plume, begins with a significant momentum flux $J_0$ and also has a [buoyancy flux](@entry_id:261821) $F_0$. Close to the source, its momentum dominates, and it behaves like a pure jet, with its centerline velocity scaling as $u_c \propto J_0^{1/2} z^{-1}$. Far from the source, the cumulative effect of buoyancy becomes dominant, and the flow transitions to behave like a pure plume, with $u_c \propto F_0^{1/3} z^{-1/3}$. The transition between these two regimes occurs at a characteristic height, $L_{jb}$. This scale can be estimated by finding the height $z$ where the two asymptotic velocity scales are equal [@problem_id:490383]. This yields a length scale, often called the Morton length, which depends on the source fluxes:
$$
L_{jb} \propto \frac{J_0^{3/4}}{F_0^{1/2}}
$$
This scale delineates the boundary between jet-like and plume-like behavior and is a critical parameter in the design of industrial burners and the modeling of environmental discharges.

A similar transitional behavior occurs for jets from non-axisymmetric orifices. A jet from a high-aspect-ratio rectangular nozzle ($W \gg h$) initially spreads primarily in its narrow direction ($h$), behaving like a 2D planar jet. Far downstream, the flow loses memory of the specific orifice shape and transitions to an axisymmetric jet. The transition distance $x_t$ can be estimated by equating the centerline velocity [scaling laws](@entry_id:139947) for a planar jet and an axisymmetric jet with an equivalent diameter [@problem_id:490378]. This analysis shows that the transition distance scales with the larger dimension of the orifice, $x_t \propto W$.

#### Coherent Structures and Swirling Flows

The picture of a [turbulent flow](@entry_id:151300) as a purely [random field](@entry_id:268702) is an oversimplification. Free shear flows contain large-scale, quasi-organized motions known as **[coherent structures](@entry_id:182915)**. The growth of a mixing layer, for instance, can be viewed not just as a continuous [diffusion process](@entry_id:268015), but as a discrete sequence of **vortex pairing** events, where large vortices roll up from the initial instability and subsequently merge with their neighbors. A simplified hierarchical model of this process predicts a [linear growth](@entry_id:157553) of the mixing layer, consistent with experimental data and [entrainment](@entry_id:275487) models [@problem_id:490360], offering a different physical perspective on the growth mechanism.

The introduction of **swirl** to a jet dramatically alters its dynamics. Swirl enhances [entrainment](@entry_id:275487) and spreading near the nozzle but can also lead to a spectacular phenomenon known as **[vortex breakdown](@entry_id:196231)**. This is an abrupt, often dramatic, structural change in the [vortex core](@entry_id:159858), characterized by the formation of a stagnation point on the axis and a subsequent region of recirculating flow. The onset of [vortex breakdown](@entry_id:196231) is governed by the **swirl number**, $S$, which is the ratio of the azimuthal momentum flux to the axial momentum flux. For an idealized swirling flow, stability analysis can be used to show that breakdown corresponds to the condition where long, stationary [inertial waves](@entry_id:165303) can exist. This analysis predicts a **critical swirl number**, $S_{crit}$, above which the flow is susceptible to breakdown [@problem_id:490397]. This critical value, which for an idealized confined flow is related to the zeros of Bessel functions, marks a fundamental stability boundary for swirling flows.
