Let one box represent the low-latitude (equatorial) ocean and the other the high-latitude (polar) ocean. The state of the system is described by the non-dimensional temperature difference, $x$, and salinity difference, $y$, between the boxes. A positive circulation strength, $\\psi$, represents a flow from the equatorial to the polar box at the surface and a return flow at depth.\n\nThe evolution of the system is governed by the following non-dimensional equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{d\\tau} = 1 - x - \\psi x\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{d\\tau} = -\\mu_{eff} - \\psi y\n$$\nHere, $\\tau$ is non-dimensional time. The circulation strength $\\psi$ is proportional to the density difference between the boxes, given by $\\psi = \\eta(x-y)$, where $\\eta$ is a parameter representing the efficiency of converting density gradients into flow.\n\nIn this problem, we introduce a feedback mechanism where the effective freshwater forcing, $\\mu_{eff}$, is not constant but depends on the inter-box temperature difference. This dependency models phenomena such as enhanced polar ice melt when the temperature difference diminishes. The effective forcing is given by:\n$$\n\\mu_{eff} = \\mu_0 - \\xi x\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_0$ is a baseline forcing parameter and $\\xi$ is the strength of the temperature-salinity feedback. A positive $\\xi$ implies that a smaller temperature difference (smaller $x$) leads to a stronger effective freshwater flux into the polar box (larger $\\mu_{eff}$), thus reducing its salinity and density.\n\nThe full system of equations is:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{d\\tau} = 1 - x - \\eta(x-y)x\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{d\\tau} = -(\\mu_0 - \\xi x) - \\eta(x-y)y\n$$\nFor certain parameter values, this system can exhibit multiple steady states.
