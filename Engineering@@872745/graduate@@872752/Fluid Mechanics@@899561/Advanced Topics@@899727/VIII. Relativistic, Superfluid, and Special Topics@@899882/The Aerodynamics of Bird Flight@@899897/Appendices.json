It is based on fundamental principles of Newtonian mechanics and aerodynamics, and the provided data are physically plausible. The problem is a valid exercise in biomechanics. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a four-part analysis, which will be executed in sequence.\n\n1) First, we define and compute the wing loading, $W_L$, for both the passerine bird and the moth. Wing loading is defined as the gravitational force (weight, $W$) acting on the organism per unit of its total wing planform area ($S$). The formula for wing loading is:\n$$W_L = \\frac{W}{S} = \\frac{mg}{S}$$\nwhere $m$ is the mass of the flier and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nFor the bird:\n$m_{\\mathrm{b}} = 0.020\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n$S_{\\mathrm{b}} = 0.015\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n$g = 9.81\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$\n\nThe wing loading of the bird, $W_{L, \\mathrm{b}}$, is:\n$$W_{L, \\mathrm{b}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{b}}g}{S_{\\mathrm{b}}} = \\frac{(0.020\\,\\mathrm{kg})(9.81\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2})}{0.015\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}} = \\frac{0.1962\\,\\mathrm{N}}{0.015\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}} = 13.08\\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\n\nFor the moth:\n$m_{\\mathrm{m}} = 0.020\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n$S_{\\mathrm{m}} = 0.005\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n\nThe wing loading of the moth, $W_{L, \\mathrm{m}}$, is:\n$$W_{L, \\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{m}}g}{S_{\\mathrm{m}}} = \\frac{(0.020\\,\\mathrm{kg})(9.81\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2})}{0.005\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}} = \\frac{0.1962\\,\\mathrm{N}}{0.005\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}} = 39.24\\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\n\n2) Second, we derive an expression for the minimum steady level flight speed, $v_{\\min}$. The condition for steady level flight is that the aerodynamic lift force, $L$, must exactly balance the weight, $W$.\n$$L = W$$\nThe lift force is given by the standard aerodynamic lift equation:\n$$L = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v^2 S C_L$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density of the air, $v$ is the flight speed, $S$ is the wing area, and $C_L$ is the dimensionless lift coefficient.\n\nEquating lift and weight gives:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\rho v^2 S C_L = W$$\nWe solve for the speed $v$:\n$$v^2 = \\frac{2W}{\\rho S C_L}$$\n$$v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2W}{\\rho S C_L}}$$\nWe can substitute the definition of wing loading, $W_L = W/S$, into this expression:\n$$v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 W_L}{\\rho C_L}}$$\nThe minimum possible speed for steady level flight, $v_{\\min}$, is achieved when the lift coefficient is at its maximum possible value, $C_{L, \\max}$. This corresponds to the flight condition at the angle of attack just before aerodynamic stall occurs. Therefore, the expression for $v_{\\min}$ is:\n$$v_{\\min} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 W_L}{\\rho C_{L, \\max}}}$$\n\n3) Third, we compute the ratio of the minimum flight speeds, $v_{\\min,\\mathrm{bird}}/v_{\\min,\\mathrm{moth}}$. Using the derived expression for $v_{\\min}$:\n$$v_{\\min,\\mathrm{bird}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 W_{L, \\mathrm{b}}}{\\rho C_{L, \\max, \\mathrm{b}}}}$$\n$$v_{\\min,\\mathrm{moth}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 W_{L, \\mathrm{m}}}{\\rho C_{L, \\max, \\mathrm{m}}}}$$\nThe ratio is:\n$$\\frac{v_{\\min,\\mathrm{bird}}}{v_{\\min,\\mathrm{moth}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{2 W_{L, \\mathrm{b}}}{\\rho C_{L, \\max, \\mathrm{b}}}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2 W_{L, \\mathrm{m}}}{\\rho C_{L, \\max, \\mathrm{m}}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{W_{L, \\mathrm{b}}}{W_{L, \\mathrm{m}}} \\cdot \\frac{C_{L, \\max, \\mathrm{m}}}{C_{L, \\max, \\mathrm{b}}}}$$\nThe problem states to assume that both taxa experience the same air density ($\\rho$) and have comparable maximum lift coefficients ($C_{L, \\max, \\mathrm{b}} \\approx C_{L, \\max, \\mathrm{m}}$) due to convergent evolution. Under this assumption, the ratio of the lift coefficients becomes approximately $1$, and the expression simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{v_{\\min,\\mathrm{bird}}}{v_{\\min,\\mathrm{moth}}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{W_{L, \\mathrm{b}}}{W_{L, \\mathrm{m}}}}$$\nWe can substitute the original parameters into this ratio:\n$$\\frac{v_{\\min,\\mathrm{bird}}}{v_{\\min,\\mathrm{moth}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{m_{\\mathrm{b}}g/S_{\\mathrm{b}}}{m_{\\mathrm{m}}g/S_{\\mathrm{m}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{m_{\\mathrm{b}}}{m_{\\mathrm{m}}} \\cdot \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{m}}}{S_{\\mathrm{b}}}}$$\nGiven that the masses are identical ($m_{\\mathrm{b}} = m_{\\mathrm{m}} = 0.020\\,\\mathrm{kg}$), the mass ratio is $1$. The expression simplifies further to:\n$$\\frac{v_{\\min,\\mathrm{bird}}}{v_{\\min,\\mathrm{moth}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{S_{\\mathrm{m}}}{S_{\\mathrm{b}}}}$$\nSubstituting the given wing areas:\n$$\\frac{v_{\\min,\\mathrm{bird}}}{v_{\\min,\\mathrm{moth}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.005\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}}{0.015\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}}$$\nCalculating the numerical value and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$\\frac{v_{\\min,\\mathrm{bird}}}{v_{\\min,\\mathrm{moth}}} \\approx 0.57735 \\dots \\approx 0.5774$$\n\n4) Fourth, we will briefly explain the comparative consequences.\nThe derived scaling law, $v_{\\min} \\propto \\sqrt{W_L}$, shows that minimum flight speed is directly proportional to the square root of wing loading. Our calculations show the moth has a wing loading ($39.24\\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$) that is three times higher than the bird's ($13.08\\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$), despite having the same mass. Consequently, the moth is constrained to fly at a significantly higher minimum speed to generate sufficient lift. The bird's lower wing loading grants it the ability to fly at a lower minimum speed (approximately $57.74\\%$ of the moth's minimum speed). A lower minimum flight speed is generally associated with enhanced maneuverability at low speeds, such as executing tighter turns and navigating complex environments. The moth's higher speed requirement suggests adaptation for different flight envelopes, such as rapid, long-distance flight in open spaces. This illustrates how a fundamental physical parameter—wing loading—dictates flight performance as a consequence of shared aerodynamic laws, a clear example of physical constraints driving convergent evolutionary outcomes.\n\nThe final answer requested is the numerical ratio.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5774}$$", "id": "2563487"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principles of lift generation, we now explore how birds adapt to changing environmental conditions.
