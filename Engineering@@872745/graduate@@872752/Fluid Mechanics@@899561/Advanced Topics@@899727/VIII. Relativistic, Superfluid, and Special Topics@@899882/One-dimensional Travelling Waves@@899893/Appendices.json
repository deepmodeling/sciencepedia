This remarkable stability arises from a delicate balance between nonlinear effects that tend to steepen the wave and dispersive effects that tend to spread it out. This exercise [@problem_id:575981] provides a direct look into this mechanism through a model equation for a nonlinear elastic beam, challenging you to derive the fundamental relationship between the wave's amplitude and its speed—a signature feature of nonlinear waves.", "problem": "The transverse displacement $u(x, t)$ of a special type of nonlinear elastic beam is described by the partial differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} - \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^4 u}{\\partial x^4} + \\beta \\frac{\\partial^2 (u^2)}{\\partial x^2} = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are positive real constants. The term with coefficient $\\alpha$ represents bending stiffness (dispersion), and the term with coefficient $\\beta$ represents a form of nonlinear stiffness.\n\nThis equation admits solitary wave solutions. A solitary wave is a localized disturbance that propagates at a constant speed without changing its shape. We seek a solution of the form $u(x,t) = U(\\xi)$, where $\\xi = x - ct$ is the moving coordinate, and $c$ is the constant wave speed. The profile function $U(\\xi)$ is localized, meaning that $U(\\xi)$ and all its derivatives with respect to $\\xi$ approach zero as $|\\xi| \\to \\infty$.\n\nConsider a solitary wave that is a \"trough\" or a pulse of depression. Its amplitude, $A$, is defined as the minimum value of the displacement, i.e., $A = \\min_{\\xi} U(\\xi)$.

Integrating once gives:\n$$\nc^2 U' - \\alpha U''' + \\beta (U^2)' = K_1\n$$\nwhere $K_1$ is an integration constant. The boundary conditions for a solitary wave are that $U$ and its derivatives vanish at infinity: $U, U', U'', U''' \\to 0$ as $|\\xi| \\to \\infty$. Applying these conditions, we find that $K_1 = 0$.\n$$\nc^2 U' - \\alpha U''' + \\beta (U^2)' = 0\n$$\nIntegrating a second time with respect to $\\xi$:\n$$\nc^2 U - \\alpha U'' + \\beta U^2 = K_2\n$$\nwhere $K_2$ is another integration constant. Applying the boundary conditions $U, U'' \\to 0$ as $|\\xi| \\to \\infty$, we find that $K_2 = 0$. The ODE for the wave profile simplifies to:\n$$\nc^2 U - \\alpha U'' + \\beta U^2 = 0\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$\n\\alpha U'' = \\beta U^2 + c^2 U\n$$\nThis is a second-order nonlinear ODE. To proceed, we use the energy integral method. We multiply the equation by $U'$:\n$$\n\\alpha U' U'' = \\beta U^2 U' + c^2 U U'\n$$\nThe terms in this equation can be recognized as the derivatives of simpler expressions:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d\\xi} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\alpha (U')^2 \\right) = \\frac{d}{d\\xi} \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\beta U^3 + \\frac{1}{2} c^2 U^2 \\right)\n$$\nIntegrating this equation with respect to $\\xi$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha (U')^2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\beta U^3 + \\frac{1}{2} c^2 U^2 + K_3\n$$\nwhere $K_3$ is the third integration constant. We again apply the boundary conditions, $U \\to 0$ and $U' \\to 0$ as $|\\xi| \\to \\infty$.

At the point of minimum displacement, let's say at $\\xi = \\xi_0$, the function $U$ reaches its extremum, so its derivative must be zero. Thus, at this point, we have $U(\\xi_0) = A$ and $U'(\\xi_0) = 0$.\nSubstituting these conditions into our first-order ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha (0)^2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\beta A^3 + \\frac{1}{2} c^2 A^2\n$$\n$$\n0 = \\frac{1}{3} \\beta A^3 + \\frac{1}{2} c^2 A^2\n$$\nWe can factor out $A^2$. Since we are looking for a non-trivial solitary wave, $A \\neq 0$. Thus, we can divide by $A^2$:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{1}{3} \\beta A + \\frac{1}{2} c^2\n$$\nNow, we solve for $c^2$ in terms of $A$ and $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} c^2 = - \\frac{1}{3} \\beta A\n$$\n$$\nc^2 = -\\frac{2}{3} \\beta A\n$$\nThis is the desired relationship between the square of the wave speed and the amplitude of the solitary trough. Since $\\beta > 0$ and $A  0$ (for a trough), the product $\\beta A$ is negative, ensuring that $c^2$ is positive, which is physically required for a real wave speed $c$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}\\beta A}\n$$", "id": "575981"}, {"introduction": "While many nonlinear equations are intractable, a special class known as \"integrable systems\" possesses a rich mathematical structure that allows for the construction of exact solutions.
