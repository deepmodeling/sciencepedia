The flow is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. We analyze the stability of a simple parallel shear flow, given by the velocity profile $\\mathbf{U} = (Sy, 0, 0)$, where $S$ is a constant positive shear rate.

A crucial simplification is made by considering perturbations that are independent of the streamwise coordinate, $x$, i.e., $\\mathbf{u}' = \\mathbf{u}'(y,z,t)$ and $p' = p'(y,z,t)$.

Analyze the cross-stream dynamics to determine the pressure perturbation**\n\nWe begin by analyzing the equations for the cross-stream velocity components, $v'$ and $w'$, and the pressure perturbation, $p'$. Let $\\nabla_{yz}^2 = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2}$ be the Laplacian operator in the cross-stream plane.

Apply $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$ to the $y$-momentum equation and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$ to the $z$-momentum equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial v'}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial y^2} + \\nu \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\nabla_{yz}^2 v') $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\frac{\\partial w'}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial z^2} + \\nu \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(\\nabla_{yz}^2 w') $$\nAdding these two equations gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(\\frac{\\partial v'}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial w'}{\\partial z}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial z^2}\\right) + \\nu \\nabla_{yz}^2 \\left(\\frac{\\partial v'}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial w'}{\\partial z}\\right) $$\nUsing the incompressibility condition, $\\frac{\\partial v'}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial w'}{\\partial z} = 0$, the terms on the left and the last term on the right vanish. This leaves us with:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\nabla_{yz}^2 p' \\implies \\nabla_{yz}^2 p' = 0 $$\nFor perturbation fields that are assumed to decay at infinity (or satisfy periodic boundary conditions), the only solution to Laplace's equation is $p' = \\text{constant}$. Since the initial pressure perturbation is given as zero, $p'(y,z,t=0) = 0$, the constant must be zero. Therefore, $p'(y,z,t) = 0$ for all time $t$.\n\n**2.

This simplifies the equation to:\n$$ \\frac{df}{dt}v' = -S v' $$\nSince $v'$ is not identically zero, we can divide by it to obtain an ordinary differential equation for $f(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{df}{dt} = -S $$\nIntegrating with respect to time gives:\n$$ f(t) = -St + C $$\nwhere $C$ is the integration constant. So, the solution is of the form $u'(y,z,t) = (-St + C)v'(y,z,t)$.\n\nTo find the constant $C$, we apply the initial condition $u'(t=0) = 0$:\n$$ u'(y,z,0) = (-S \\cdot 0 + C)v'(y,z,0) = C v_0(y,z) $$\nFor $u'(y,z,0)=0$ with a non-trivial initial vortex field ($v_0 \\neq 0$), we must have $C=0$.\n\nTherefore, the function is $f(t) = -St$, and the relationship between $u'$ and $v'$ is:\n$$ u'(y,z,t) = -S t \\, v'(y,z,t) $$\n\n**4. Determine the requested ratio**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $\\frac{u'(y,z,t)}{v'(y,z,t)}$. Using the result from the previous step, we divide by $v'(y,z,t)$ (which is assumed to be non-zero):\n$$ \\frac{u'(y,z,t)}{v'(y,z,t)} = -S t $$\nThis shows that the streamwise velocity perturbation generated by the lift-up effect grows linearly with time relative to the decaying wall-normal perturbation.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-St} $$", "id": "452090"}, {"introduction": "The Orr-Sommerfeld equation is the cornerstone for the linear stability analysis of parallel viscous flows, but its fourth-order nature can be challenging to solve.
