The time-evolution of the system is represented as a trajectory in a multi-dimensional phase space. Over long time scales, this trajectory traces out a geometric structure known as a strange attractor.\n\nTo quantify the complexity of this attractor, the physicist employs the box-counting method. This numerical technique involves overlaying the phase space with a grid of hypercubes of uniform side length $\\epsilon$, and then counting the number of such hypercubes, $N(\\epsilon)$, that are intersected by the attractor's trajectory. This process is repeated for many different values of $\\epsilon$.\n\nThe physicist discovers that a plot of the natural logarithm of the box count, $\\ln(N(\\epsilon))$, versus the natural logarithm of the box size, $\\ln(\\epsilon)$, yields a straight line for small values of $\\epsilon$.
