Streamlines of the flow are defined as curves along which the stream function $\\psi$ is constant.\n\nConsider the potential flow of a fluid over a semi-infinite flat plate. The plate is aligned with the positive x-axis, such that it occupies the region defined by $y=0$ and $x \\ge 0$. This physical problem can be analyzed by mapping it to a simpler geometry.

This problem moves into the realm of unsteady fluid dynamics to calculate the \"added mass\" of a circular arc airfoil, a concept critical for understanding how an accelerating body behaves as if it were heavier due to the inertia of the surrounding fluid. By employing a Joukowski-type transformation, you will see how the kinetic energy imparted to the fluid can be calculated in a simpler, mapped domain, linking the geometry of the airfoil directly to its inertial properties [@problem_id:620184].", "problem": "An infinitely long, thin cylindrical object with a cross-section in the shape of a circular arc is placed in an unbounded, ideal, incompressible, and irrotational fluid of density $\\rho$. The fluid is initially at rest. The circular arc is symmetric with respect to the y-axis, has a chord of length $L$ lying on the x-axis, and a maximum height (camber) $h$.\n\nThe arc is generated by the Joukowski-type transformation $z = \\zeta + \\frac{c^2}{\\zeta}$ which maps the exterior of a specific circle in the complex $\\zeta$-plane to the exterior of the arc in the physical $z$-plane. This generating circle in the $\\zeta$-plane is centered at $\\zeta_0 = id$ on the imaginary axis and has a radius $b$ satisfying the condition $b^2 = c^2+d^2$.\n\nAt time $t=0$, the arc is impulsively set into motion with a constant velocity $U$ in the positive y-direction (broadside motion). This motion induces a flow in the surrounding fluid, endowing the fluid with kinetic energy.

Relate Physical Geometry ($L, h$) to Mapping Parameters ($c, d, b$)**\n\nThe problem states that the circular arc in the $z$-plane is generated by the transformation $z = \\zeta + \\frac{c^2}{\\zeta}$ applied to the circle $|\\zeta - id| = b$ in the $\\zeta$-plane, where $b^2 = c^2 + d^2$.\n\nThe endpoints of the chord of the arc correspond to a point on the circle that also lies on the real axis in the $\\zeta$-plane. Since the circle $|\\zeta - id| = b$ passes through $\\zeta = \\pm c$ (as $c^2 = b^2-d^2$), these points map to:\n$$z(\\pm c) = \\pm c + \\frac{c^2}{\\pm c} = \\pm 2c$$\nThe chord of the arc thus extends from $z=-2c$ to $z=2c$. Its length is $L = 4c$, which gives $c = \\frac{L}{4}$.\n\nThe highest point of the arc (the camber) corresponds to the point on the circle furthest along the positive imaginary axis, which is $\\zeta = i(d+b)$. Applying the transformation:\n$$z_{top} = i(d+b) + \\frac{c^2}{i(d+b)} = i\\left(d+b - \\frac{c^2}{d+b}\\right)$$\nThe height $h$ is the imaginary part of $z_{top}$.\n$$h = d+b - \\frac{c^2}{d+b} = \\frac{(d+b)^2 - c^2}{d+b}$$\nUsing the given relation $b^2 = c^2+d^2$, we have $c^2=b^2-d^2$:\n$$h = \\frac{d^2+2db+b^2 - (b^2-d^2)}{d+b} = \\frac{2d^2+2db}{d+b} = \\frac{2d(d+b)}{d+b} = 2d$$\nThis gives $d = \\frac{h}{2}$.\n\nWe now have the mapping parameters in terms of the physical dimensions $L$ and $h$.

The squared velocity is $|\\vec{v}|^2 = \\left|\\frac{dW}{dz}\\right|^2$, where $W(z)$ is the complex potential. The kinetic energy integral can be transformed into the $\\zeta$-plane:\n$$T = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho \\iint_{\\mathcal{D}_z} \\left|\\frac{dW}{dz}\\right|^2 \\,dx\\,dy = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho \\iint_{\\mathcal{D}_\\zeta} \\left|\\frac{d\\mathcal{W}/d\\zeta}{dz/d\\zeta}\\right|^2 \\left|\\frac{dz}{d\\zeta}\\right|^2 \\,d\\xi\\,d\\eta = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho \\iint_{\\mathcal{D}_\\zeta} \\left|\\frac{d\\mathcal{W}}{d\\zeta}\\right|^2 \\,d\\xi\\,d\\eta$$\nThis shows that the kinetic energy can be calculated in the simpler geometry of the $\\zeta$-plane, provided we know the complex potential $\\mathcal{W}(\\zeta)$ there.\n\n**3. Complex Potential in the $\\zeta$-plane**\n\nThe problem states to assume that the motion of the arc corresponds to a rigid translation of the generating circle in the $\\zeta$-plane. The arc moves with velocity $U$ in the y-direction, which corresponds to a complex velocity of $V_z=iU$. We assume the generating circle moves with the same complex velocity, $V_\\zeta = iU$.\n\nThe complex potential $\\mathcal{W}(\\zeta)$ for a circular cylinder of radius $b$, centered at $\\zeta_0$, moving with velocity $V_\\zeta$ through a fluid at rest at infinity is given by:\n$$\\mathcal{W}(\\zeta) = -\\frac{\\bar{V}_\\zeta b^2}{\\zeta - \\zeta_0} = -\\frac{(-iU) b^2}{\\zeta - id} = \\frac{iU b^2}{\\zeta-id}$$\nNote: We chose this form of the potential because it correctly gives the added mass for a translating cylinder.\n\n**4. Calculating the Kinetic Energy**\n\nWith the potential $\\mathcal{W}(\\zeta)$, we can calculate the kinetic energy $T$ by integrating in the $\\zeta$-plane. The domain $\\mathcal{D}_\\zeta$ is the exterior of the circle $|\\zeta - id| = b$. Let's make a change of variables $\\zeta' = \\zeta - id$.
