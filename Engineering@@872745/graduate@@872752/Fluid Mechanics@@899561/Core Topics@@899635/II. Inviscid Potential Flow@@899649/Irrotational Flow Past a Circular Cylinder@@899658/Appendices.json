The cylinder's axis is parallel to the z-axis, and it translates along the x-axis. The fluid is confined between two infinite parallel plane walls located at $x=-H$ and $x=H$. The flow is two-dimensional and irrotational. At a given instant, the center of the cylinder is located at $(x_c, 0)$, with $0 \\le x_c < H$.\n\nThe motion of the cylinder in the fluid can be modeled by placing a potential doublet at its center, and an infinite series of image doublets to satisfy the no-penetration boundary conditions at the walls.\n\n**Background Information:**\n1.  The complex potential for a doublet of strength $\\mu$ located at the origin and oriented along the positive x-axis is $w(z) = \\mu/z$. The cylinder's motion with velocity $U$ is represented by a primary doublet of strength $\\mu = U R^2$.\n2.  An image of a doublet oriented parallel to a plane wall has the same strength and orientation as the original doublet.\n3.  The kinetic energy per unit length of the fluid, $T$, is related to the added mass per unit length, $m_{added}$, by $T = \\frac{1}{2} m_{added} U^2$.\n4.  The kinetic energy can also be calculated from the velocity field.

Due to the variation of the channel confinement with the cylinder's position $x_c$, the added mass $m_{added}$ is a function of $x_c$.
