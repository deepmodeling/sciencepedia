It constitutes a classical problem in ideal fluid mechanics, specifically potential flow theory. The assumptions of steady, incompressible, inviscid, and irrotational flow are self-consistent and sufficient for deriving a unique theoretical solution. The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded within the framework of this idealized model.\n\nThe solution proceeds from first principles as requested.\n\nThe flow is described as irrotational, which implies the existence of a velocity potential, $\\phi$, such that the velocity vector field $\\mathbf{u}$ is given by its gradient: $\\mathbf{u} = \\nabla\\phi$. The flow is also incompressible, meaning the divergence of the velocity field is zero: $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$. Combining these two conditions yields Laplace's equation for the velocity potential:\n$$ \\nabla^2\\phi = 0 $$\nWe solve this equation in a two-dimensional polar coordinate system $(r, \\theta)$, with the origin at the center of the cylinder. Let the uniform free stream with speed $U$ be directed along the positive $x$-axis. The standard solution for the velocity potential $\\phi(r, \\theta)$ representing flow past a cylinder of radius $R$ is the superposition of a uniform stream and a dipole placed at the origin:\n$$ \\phi(r, \\theta) = U \\left( r + \\frac{R^2}{r} \\right) \\cos\\theta $$\nHere, $\\theta$ is the standard polar angle measured counter-clockwise from the positive $x$-axis.\n\nThe components of the velocity vector in polar coordinates are given by $u_r = \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial r}$ and $u_\\theta = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial\\theta}$.\nThe radial velocity component is:\n$$ u_r(r, \\theta) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left[ U \\left( r + \\frac{R^2}{r} \\right) \\cos\\theta \\right] = U \\left( 1 - \\frac{R^2}{r^2} \\right) \\cos\\theta $$\nThe tangential velocity component is:\n$$ u_\\theta(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta} \\left[ U \\left( r + \\frac{R^2}{r} \\right) \\cos\\theta \\right] = - \\frac{1}{r} U \\left( r + \\frac{R^2}{r} \\right) \\sin\\theta $$\nOn the surface of the cylinder, we set $r=R$. The radial velocity becomes $u_r(R, \\theta) = U(1 - R^2/R^2)\\cos\\theta = 0$, which correctly satisfies the no-penetration boundary condition. The tangential velocity on the surface is:\n$$ u_\\theta(R, \\theta) = - \\frac{1}{R} U \\left( R + \\frac{R^2}{R} \\right) \\sin\\theta = -2U\\sin\\theta $$\nSince the radial velocity is zero, the fluid speed on the surface, $v_s$, is the magnitude of the tangential velocity: $v_s(\\theta) = |u_\\theta(R, \\theta)| = |-2U\\sin\\theta| = 2U|\\sin\\theta|$.\n\nTo find the pressure distribution on the surface, we apply Bernoulli's equation for steady, incompressible, inviscid flow. Since the flow is also irrotational, Bernoulli's constant is the same throughout the entire flow field. We relate the conditions in the far-field (pressure $p_\\infty$, speed $U$) to the conditions on the cylinder surface (pressure $p(\\theta)$, speed $v_s(\\theta)$):\n$$ p_\\infty + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho U^2 = p(\\theta) + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_s(\\theta)^2 $$\nSubstituting $v_s(\\theta)^2 = (2U\\sin\\theta)^2 = 4U^2\\sin^2\\theta$, we solve for $p(\\theta)$:\n$$ p(\\theta) = p_\\infty + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho U^2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\rho (4U^2\\sin^2\\theta) = p_\\infty + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho U^2 (1 - 4\\sin^2\\theta) $$\nThis expression gives the pressure distribution on the surface of the cylinder.\n\nFor Task 1, we now find the pressure coefficient $C_p(\\theta)$:\n$$ C_p(\\theta) = \\frac{p(\\theta) - p_\\infty}{\\frac{1}{2}\\rho U^2} = \\frac{\\left[p_\\infty + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho U^2 (1 - 4\\sin^2\\theta)\\right] - p_\\infty}{\\frac{1}{2}\\rho U^2} = 1 - 4\\sin^2\\theta $$\nThe problem defines its angle, let us call it $\\theta_p$, from the front stagnation point. In our standard coordinate system, the front stagnation point is at $\\theta = \\pi$. Thus, the relationship is $\\theta = \\theta_p + \\pi$. However, since $C_p$ depends on $\\sin^2\\theta$, and $\\sin^2(\\theta_p + \\pi) = (-\\sin\\theta_p)^2 = \\sin^2\\theta_p$, the expression for the pressure coefficient is identical regardless of the angular reference point: $C_p(\\theta_p) = 1 - 4\\sin^2\\theta_p$.\n\nFor Task 2, we must compute the streamwise pressure force per unit span, $D_p$, also known as the form drag. This is obtained by integrating the streamwise component of the pressure force over the cylinder's circumference. The force element on a surface patch of area $d\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{n} dS$ is $d\\mathbf{F} = -p(\\theta) \\mathbf{n} dS$. The streamwise direction is along the $x$-axis. The drag component is thus $dD_p = d\\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{i}} = -p(\\theta) (\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{i}}) dS$.\nIn our standard polar coordinates, the outward unit normal is $\\mathbf{n} = \\cos\\theta\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{i}} + \\sin\\theta\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$, so $\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{i}} = \\cos\\theta$. The differential arc length (for a unit span) is $dS = R\\,d\\theta$. The total form drag $D_p$ is the integral over the full circle from $\\theta=0$ to $\\theta=2\\pi$:\n$$ D_p = \\oint dD_p = - \\int_0^{2\\pi} p(\\theta) (\\cos\\theta) R\\,d\\theta $$\nSubstituting the expression for $p(\\theta)$:\n$$ D_p = -R \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left[ p_\\infty + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho U^2 (1 - 4\\sin^2\\theta) \\right] \\cos\\theta \\,d\\theta $$\nWe can separate this into two integrals:\n$$ D_p = -R p_\\infty \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\cos\\theta \\,d\\theta - \\frac{1}{2}R\\rho U^2 \\int_0^{2\\pi} (1 - 4\\sin^2\\theta)\\cos\\theta \\,d\\theta $$\nLet us evaluate each integral. The first integral is:\n$$ \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\cos\\theta \\,d\\theta = [\\sin\\theta]_0^{2\\pi} = \\sin(2\\pi) - \\sin(0) = 0 - 0 = 0 $$\nFor the second integral, we can use the substitution $u = \\sin\\theta$, which gives $du = \\cos\\theta\\,d\\theta$. As $\\theta$ goes from $0$ to $2\\pi$, the value of $u$ goes from $0$ to $1$, then to $-1$, and back to $0$. The integral over a full cycle in $\\theta$ corresponds to an integral from $u=0$ to $u=0$, which is zero:\n$$ \\int_0^{2\\pi} (1 - 4\\sin^2\\theta)\\cos\\theta \\,d\\theta = \\int_{\\sin(0)}^{\\sin(2\\pi)} (1 - 4u^2)\\,du = \\int_0^0 (1 - 4u^2)\\,du = 0 $$\nBoth integrals are zero. Consequently, the total form drag is:\n$$ D_p = -R p_\\infty (0) - \\frac{1}{2}R\\rho U^2 (0) = 0 $$\nThis result, that a body in a steady, incompressible, inviscid, irrotational flow experiences zero drag, is known as d'Alembert's Paradox. It is a direct consequence of the idealized assumptions, which neglect viscosity and thus prevent the formation of a separated wake that is the true source of form drag in a real fluid.\n\nThe pressure drag coefficient, $C_{D,p}$, is defined as:\n$$ C_{D,p} \\equiv \\frac{D_{p}}{\\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\rho\\,U^{2}\\,D} $$\nwhere the reference length is the cylinder diameter $D = 2R$. Since we have proven from first principles that $D_p=0$ under the given assumptions, the drag coefficient is also zero:\n$$ C_{D,p} = \\frac{0}{\\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\rho\\,U^{2}\\,(2R)} = 0 $$\nThis theoretical result is independent of the fluid density $\\rho$, the free stream speed $U$, and the cylinder radius $R$. Therefore, for all test cases provided, the value of $C_{D,p}$ is exactly $0$.
