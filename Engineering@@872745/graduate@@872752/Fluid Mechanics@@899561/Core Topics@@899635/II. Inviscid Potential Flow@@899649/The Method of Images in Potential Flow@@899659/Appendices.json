The fluid is bounded below by a solid, impermeable infinite wall along the $x$-axis (the line $y=0$). The flow is generated by a line source of constant strength $m$ (representing volume flow rate per unit length) positioned at coordinates $(0, h)$, where $h > 0$.

The wall is impermeable, which imposes a boundary condition on the fluid velocity. Specifically, the component of the velocity normal to the wall must be zero at the wall. For a wall along the $x$-axis, this means the $y$-component of the velocity, $v_y$, must be zero for all $x$ at $y=0$.\n\nThis problem can be solved using the method of images. We model the effect of the wall by removing the wall itself and placing a suitable \"image\" source in the region $y<0$. The velocity field in the physical region $y>0$ is then the superposition of the fields from the original (real) source and the image source.\n\nThe real line source is at position $\\vec{r}_1 = (0, h)$.
