The motion of the three vortices will be symmetric. We can therefore analyze the motion of a single vortex, and the result will hold for all three. Let $R(t)$ be the distance of any vortex from the origin at time $t$.\n\n**1. Initial Geometry**\nFor an equilateral triangle with side length $L_0$, the distance from the centroid to any vertex, $R_0$, is given by:\n$$R_0 = \\frac{L_0}{2 \\cos(30^\\circ)} = \\frac{L_0}{2(\\sqrt{3}/2)} = \\frac{L_0}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\nSo, at $t=0$, we have $R(0) = R_0 = L_0/\\sqrt{3}$.

Velocity induced by other vortices**\nThe velocity of a given vortex is the sum of the velocities induced by the other two vortices and the sink. Let's focus on the velocity component due to the other vortices first. By symmetry, the three vortices will always form an equilateral triangle, which rotates and shrinks. The distance from the center to any vertex is $R(t)$, and the side length of the triangle is $L(t) = \\sqrt{3}R(t)$.\n\nLet's consider one vortex, say vortex 1, and calculate the velocity induced on it by vortices 2 and 3.

The velocity induced by vortex 3 is $\\vec{v}_{13}$, with the same magnitude. The vector sum of these two velocities determines the motion of vortex 1 due to its peers.\n\nBy symmetry, the radial components of $\\vec{v}_{12}$ and $\\vec{v}_{13}$ (with respect to the origin) cancel out. The tangential components add up. The velocity vector from vortex 2 to vortex 1 makes an angle of $30^\\circ$ (or $\\pi/6$ radians) with the radial direction from the origin to vortex 1. Thus, the tangential component of the velocity from vortex 2 is $\\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi L} \\cos(30^\\circ)$. Vortex 3 contributes an equal amount.\n\nThe total tangential velocity due to the other two vortices is:\n$$v_{\\theta, vort} = 2 \\times \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi L} \\cos(30^\\circ) = \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\pi L} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$$\nSubstituting $L = \\sqrt{3}R$:\n$$v_{\\theta, vort} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\pi (\\sqrt{3}R)} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi R}$$\nThis component causes the triangle of vortices to rotate rigidly with an angular velocity $\\omega = v_{\\theta, vort}/R = \\Gamma/(2\\pi R^2)$.\n\n**3. Velocity induced by the sink**\nThe sink of strength $Q$ at the origin induces a purely radial velocity field. At a distance $R$ from the origin, the velocity is directed towards the center and has magnitude:\n$$v_r = -\\frac{Q}{2\\pi R}$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the velocity is radially inward.\n\n**4.
