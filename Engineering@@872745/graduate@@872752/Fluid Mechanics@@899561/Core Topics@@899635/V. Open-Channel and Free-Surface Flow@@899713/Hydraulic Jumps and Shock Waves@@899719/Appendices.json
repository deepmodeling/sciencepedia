It represents a rapid transition from a high-velocity, shallow flow (supercritical) to a low-velocity, deep flow (subcritical). This jump can be modeled as a one-dimensional stationary shock wave in the fluid.\n\nConsider a steady, uniform flow of an incompressible fluid of constant density $\\rho$ in a wide rectangular channel of constant width.

Assume an incompressible, inviscid fluid with a hydrostatic pressure distribution, a horizontal bed, and no body forces other than gravity. Treat the flow as per-unit-width so that the discharge per unit width is a scalar. Consider a control volume enclosing a stationary discontinuity so that the integral forms of conservation of mass and conservation of momentum apply across the discontinuity, with the hydrostatic distribution of pressure through the depth.\n\nLet the upstream depth be $h_1$ (in $\\mathrm{m}$), the upstream velocity be $u_1$ (in $\\mathrm{m/s}$), and the gravitational acceleration be $g$ (in $\\mathrm{m/s^2}$). The discharge per unit width is $q = h_1 u_1$ (in $\\mathrm{m^2/s}$). A downstream state $h_2$ (in $\\mathrm{m}$) and $u_2$ (in $\\mathrm{m/s}$) is admissible for a stationary hydraulic jump if and only if it satisfies the governing equations and is physically realizable with $h_2 > h_1$ and $u_2 = q/h_2  u_1$. If no such state exists, you should report that no stationary hydraulic jump exists for the given upstream state.\n\nYour task is to write a complete program that, for each test case listed below, does the following from first principles of the shallow water equations:\n1. Determines whether a physically admissible stationary hydraulic jump exists.\n2. If it exists, computes the conjugate downstream depth $h_2$ (in $\\mathrm{m}$) and the specific energy loss across the jump $\\Delta E$ (in $\\mathrm{m}$), where the specific energy of a state is $E = h + \\dfrac{u^2}{2g}$.\n3. If it does not exist, returns $h_2 = h_1$ and $\\Delta E = 0$.\n\nUse the following test suite.

We will treat the jump as a discontinuity within a steady flow governed by the shallow water equations. The solution is derived from the first principles of mass and momentum conservation applied across this discontinuity.\n\nWe establish a control volume that encloses the stationary jump. The flow enters at station $1$ (upstream) with depth $h_1$ and velocity $u_1$, and exits at station $2$ (downstream) with depth $h_2$ and velocity $u_2$. The channel is rectangular and we consider the flow per unit width.\n\nFirst, we apply the principle of mass conservation. For a steady, incompressible flow, the mass flow rate must be constant. The discharge per unit width, $q$, is therefore conserved across the jump:\n$$q = u_1 h_1 = u_2 h_2$$\nThis provides a relationship between velocity and depth at any station: $u = q/h$.\n\nNext, we apply the principle of momentum conservation. For a steady flow, the net force on the control volume equals the net rate of momentum efflux. The forces acting on the fluid in the control volume are the pressure forces at the inlet and outlet. We assume a hydrostatic pressure distribution, $p(z) = \\rho g (h-z)$, where $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $g$ is gravitational acceleration, and $z$ is the vertical coordinate from the bed. The pressure force per unit width at a section with depth $h$ is:\n$$F_p = \\int_0^h p(z) dz = \\int_0^h \\rho g (h-z) dz = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho g h^2$$\nThe net force on the control volume in the direction of flow is $F_p_1 - F_p_2$. The rate of momentum flow (momentum flux) per unit width is $\\rho q u$. The momentum balance is:\n$$F_p_1 - F_p_2 = (\\rho q u_2) - (\\rho q u_1)$$\nSubstituting the expressions for pressure force and simplifying by dividing by $\\rho$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} g h_1^2 - \\frac{1}{2} g h_2^2 = q(u_2 - u_1)$$\nUsing the continuity relation $u_1 = q/h_1$ and $u_2 = q/h_2$, we substitute for the velocities:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} g (h_1^2 - h_2^2) = q \\left(\\frac{q}{h_2} - \\frac{q}{h_1}\\right) = q^2 \\frac{h_1 - h_2}{h_1 h_2}$$\nWe can factor the left side as $\\frac{1}{2} g (h_1 - h_2)(h_1 + h_2)$. For a hydraulic jump, we seek a non-trivial solution where $h_2 \\neq h_1$, so we can divide both sides by the term $(h_1 - h_2)$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} g (h_1 + h_2) = \\frac{q^2}{h_1 h_2}$$\nThis equation relates the upstream and downstream depths, known as conjugate depths. To find $h_2$ for a given upstream state $(h_1, q)$, we rearrange the equation into a quadratic form for $h_2$:\n$$g h_1 h_2 (h_1 + h_2) = 2q^2$$\n$$g h_1 h_2^2 + g h_1^2 h_2 - 2q^2 = 0$$\nDividing by $g h_1$ yields:\n$$h_2^2 + h_1 h_2 - \\frac{2q^2}{g h_1} = 0$$\nSolving for $h_2$ using the quadratic formula, $h_2 = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$h_2 = \\frac{-h_1 \\pm \\sqrt{h_1^2 - 4(1)(-\\frac{2q^2}{g h_1})}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-h_1 \\pm \\sqrt{h_1^2 + \\frac{8q^2}{g h_1}}}{2}$$\nSince depth $h_2$ must be a positive physical quantity, we select the positive root:\n$$h_2 = \\frac{h_1}{2} \\left( -1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{8q^2}{g h_1^3}} \\right)$$\nThis is the Belanger equation. The term $\\frac{q^2}{g h_1^3}$ is the square of the upstream Froude number, $Fr_1^2 = \\frac{u_1^2}{g h_1} = \\frac{(q/h_1)^2}{g h_1} = \\frac{q^2}{g h_1^3}$. So, the equation can be written as:\n$$h_2 = \\frac{h_1}{2} (\\sqrt{1 + 8 Fr_1^2} - 1)$$\nA physically admissible hydraulic jump requires the downstream depth to be greater than the upstream depth, $h_2 > h_1$. Applying this condition:\n$$\\frac{h_1}{2} (\\sqrt{1 + 8 Fr_1^2} - 1) > h_1$$\n$$\\sqrt{1 + 8 Fr_1^2} - 1 > 2$$\n$$\\sqrt{1 + 8 Fr_1^2} > 3$$\n$$1 + 8 Fr_1^2 > 9 \\implies 8 Fr_1^2 > 8 \\implies Fr_1^2 > 1$$\nThus, a stationary hydraulic jump can only form if the upstream flow is supercritical, i.e., $Fr_1 > 1$. If $Fr_1 \\le 1$, no such jump is possible, and the problem specifies to set $h_2 = h_1$.\n\nThe specific energy of the flow is defined as $E = h + \\frac{u^2}{2g}$. The energy loss across the jump, $\\Delta E$, is the difference between the upstream and downstream specific energies:\n$$\\Delta E = E_1 - E_2 = \\left(h_1 + \\frac{u_1^2}{2g}\\right) - \\left(h_2 + \\frac{u_2^2}{2g}\\right)$$\nSubstituting $u = q/h$:\n$$\\Delta E = (h_1 - h_2) + \\frac{q^2}{2g} \\left(\\frac{1}{h_1^2} - \\frac{1}{h_2^2}\\right)$$\nA more compact form for energy loss can be derived. From the momentum equation, we have $q^2 = \\frac{g}{2} h_1 h_2 (h_1 + h_2)$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\Delta E$ and simplifying leads to:\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{(h_2 - h_1)^3}{4 h_1 h_2}$$\nThis expression shows that for a jump to occur ($h_2 > h_1$), there must be a positive energy loss ($\\Delta E > 0$), consistent with the second law of thermodynamics. If $Fr_1 \\le 1$, then $h_2 = h_1$ and $\\Delta E = 0$.\n\nThe algorithm for each test case $(g, h_1, q)$ is as follows:\n$1$. Calculate the upstream Froude number squared: $Fr_1^2 = \\frac{q^2}{g h_1^3}$.\n$2$. If $Fr_1^2 > 1$, a jump exists ($J=1$). Calculate $h_2$ using the Belanger equation and $\\Delta E$ using the energy loss formula.\n$3$. If $Fr_1^2 \\le 1$, no jump exists ($J=0$). Set $h_2 = h_1$ and $\\Delta E = 0$.\n$4$.
