It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive the required quantities. It presents a standard exercise in continuum mechanics, specifically on the decomposition of the Cauchy stress tensor.\n\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental additive decomposition of the Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ into a spherical (hydrostatic) part and a deviatoric part. This is given by the relation:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = p\\,\\boldsymbol{I} + \\boldsymbol{s}\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the deviatoric stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor, and $p$ is the hydrostatic pressure. The hydrostatic pressure $p$ is defined as one-third of the trace of the stress tensor:\n$$\np = \\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})\n$$\nThe trace of a tensor is an invariant, meaning it is independent of the coordinate system. In any coordinate system, $\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = \\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22} + \\sigma_{33}$. In the principal coordinate system, the off-diagonal components of the stress tensor are zero, and the diagonal components are the principal stresses $\\sigma_1$, $\\sigma_2$, and $\\sigma_3$. Thus, the trace is the sum of the principal stresses:\n$$\n\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = \\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2 + \\sigma_3\n$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of hydrostatic pressure gives:\n$$\np = \\frac{1}{3}(\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2 + \\sigma_3)\n$$\nThis quantity $p$ is also known as the mean stress.\n\nTo find the deviatoric stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{s}$, we rearrange the initial decomposition:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{s} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - p\\,\\boldsymbol{I}\n$$\nFor an isotropic material, the principal directions of the stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ and the deviatoric stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{s}$ are coaxial. Therefore, we can write this tensor equation in the principal coordinate system, where $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ and $\\boldsymbol{s}$ are represented by diagonal matrices of their principal values $(s_1, s_2, s_3)$ and $(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3)$, respectively. The tensor equation becomes a set of three scalar equations for the principal components:\n$$\ns_1 = \\sigma_1 - p\n$$\n$$\ns_2 = \\sigma_2 - p\n$$\n$$\ns_3 = \\sigma_3 - p\n$$\nThis is the general form of the principal deviatoric stresses $s_i$ in terms of the principal Cauchy stresses $\\sigma_i$ and the mean stress $p$.

This is equivalent to showing that the first invariant (the trace) of the deviatoric stress tensor is zero, i.e., $\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{s}) = s_1 + s_2 + s_3 = 0$.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, it is valid, and we proceed with its resolution.\n\nThe foundation of this problem is the isotropic linear elastic constitutive relation, or Hooke's Law, which connects the second-order stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ to the second-order strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\lambda (\\operatorname{tr}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) \\boldsymbol{I} + 2\\mu\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\n$$\nHere, $\\boldsymbol{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor, and $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ are the Lamé parameters.

These equations reveal a fundamental principle: the deviatoric stress (related to shape change) is solely dependent on the deviatoric strain (distortion), while the hydrostatic stress (related to volume change) is solely dependent on the volumetric strain (dilatation). This completes the first part of the problem.\n\nThe second task requires specialization to the state of plane strain. The conditions for plane strain are $\\varepsilon_{33} = 0$, $\\varepsilon_{13} = 0$, and $\\varepsilon_{23} = 0$.

By direct comparison with our derived expression $\\sigma_{33} = \\lambda (\\varepsilon_{11} + \\varepsilon_{22})$, we immediately see that:\n$$\nM_{\\text{out}} = \\lambda\n$$\nThe final step is to express this modulus in terms of the engineering constants, Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$.

The decomposition must be derived from first principles using orthogonal projection arguments within the vector space of $3 \\times 3$ real matrices equipped with the Frobenius inner product $A : B = \\operatorname{tr}(A^{\\mathsf{T}} B)$.\n\nA general tensor $A$ is to be uniquely decomposed as a sum $A = A_s + A_d$, where $A_s = \\operatorname{sph}(A)$ belongs to the spherical subspace $\\mathcal{S} = \\{ s I \\mid s \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}$ and $A_d = \\operatorname{dev}(A)$ belongs to the deviatoric subspace $\\mathcal{D} = \\{ M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 3} \\mid \\operatorname{tr}(M) = 0 \\}$. This decomposition is an orthogonal decomposition, which means that the subspaces $\\mathcal{S}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$ must be orthogonal complements in the vector space $V = \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 3}$.\n\nFirst, we must verify that $\\mathcal{S}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$ are orthogonal subspaces. Let $A_s$ be an arbitrary element of $\\mathcal{S}$ and $A_d$ be an arbitrary element of $\\mathcal{D}$. By definition, we can write $A_s = sI$ for some scalar $s \\in \\mathbb{R}$, where $I$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix. Also by definition, $\\operatorname{tr}(A_d) = 0$. Their Frobenius inner product is:\n$$\nA_s : A_d = \\operatorname{tr}(A_s^{\\mathsf{T}} A_d) = \\operatorname{tr}((sI)^{\\mathsf{T}} A_d) = \\operatorname{tr}(sI A_d) = s \\operatorname{tr}(A_d)\n$$\nSince $\\operatorname{tr}(A_d) = 0$, the inner product is $A_s : A_d = s \\cdot 0 = 0$. This confirms that every element of $\\mathcal{S}$ is orthogonal to every element of $\\mathcal{D}$, so the subspaces are orthogonal, i.e., $\\mathcal{S} \\perp \\mathcal{D}$.\n\nNext, we establish that $V = \\mathcal{S} \\oplus \\mathcal{D}$. The dimension of the vector space $V = \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 3}$ is $\\dim(V) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$. The spherical subspace $\\mathcal{S}$ is spanned by a single non-zero tensor $I$, so its dimension is $\\dim(\\mathcal{S}) = 1$. The deviatoric subspace $\\mathcal{D}$ is the kernel of the linear map (functional) $\\operatorname{tr}: V \\to \\mathbb{R}$. By the rank-nullity theorem, $\\dim(V) = \\dim(\\operatorname{ker}(\\operatorname{tr})) + \\dim(\\operatorname{im}(\\operatorname{tr}))$. Since the trace can take any real value, the image of the trace operator is all of $\\mathbb{R}$, so $\\dim(\\operatorname{im}(\\operatorname{tr})) = 1$. It follows that $\\dim(\\mathcal{D}) = \\dim(\\operatorname{ker}(\\operatorname{tr})) = \\dim(V) - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8$. Since $\\dim(\\mathcal{S}) + \\dim(\\mathcal{D}) = 1 + 8 = 9 = \\dim(V)$ and the subspaces are orthogonal, they are orthogonal complements, and $V$ can be expressed as their direct sum. This guarantees that any tensor $A \\in V$ has a unique orthogonal decomposition $A = A_s + A_d$.\n\nThe component $A_s = \\operatorname{sph}(A)$ is the orthogonal projection of $A$ onto the subspace $\\mathcal{S}$. To compute this projection, we first construct an orthonormal basis for $\\mathcal{S}$. A basis for $\\mathcal{S}$ is $\\{I\\}$. We normalize this basis vector with respect to the Frobenius norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_F$. The squared norm of $I$ is:\n$$\n\\|I\\|_F^2 = I : I = \\operatorname{tr}(I^{\\mathsf{T}} I) = \\operatorname{tr}(I^2) = \\operatorname{tr}(I) = 1+1+1 = 3\n$$\nThus, $\\|I\\|_F = \\sqrt{3}$. An orthonormal basis for $\\mathcal{S}$ is $\\{E_s\\}$, where $E_s = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}I$. The orthogonal projection of $A$ onto $\\mathcal{S}$ is then given by:\n$$\n\\operatorname{sph}(A) = \\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathcal{S}}(A) = (A : E_s) E_s = \\left(A : \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}I\\right) \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}I = \\frac{1}{3} (A : I) I\n$$\nThe inner product $A:I$ is computed as:\n$$\nA : I = \\operatorname{tr}(A^{\\mathsf{T}} I) = \\operatorname{tr}(A^{\\mathsf{T}}) = \\operatorname{tr}(A)\n$$\nSubstituting this result gives the formula for the spherical part of the tensor:\n$$\n\\operatorname{sph}(A) = \\frac{1}{3} \\operatorname{tr}(A) I\n$$\nThe coefficient $\\frac{1}{3} \\operatorname{tr}(A)$ is the mean normal component, often associated with hydrostatic pressure in stress tensors.\n\nSince $A = \\operatorname{sph}(A) + \\operatorname{dev}(A)$ and the decomposition is orthogonal, the deviatoric part $\\operatorname{dev}(A)$ is simply the remainder:\n$$\n\\operatorname{dev}(A) = A - \\operatorname{sph}(A) = A - \\frac{1}{3} \\operatorname{tr}(A) I\n$$\n$\\operatorname{dev}(A)$ is the orthogonal projection of $A$ onto the subspace $\\mathcal{D}$.
