For the surface $S$ at $r=R$ with normal $\\mathbf{n}=\\mathbf{e}_r$, this is expressed as:\n$$(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{v})\\cdot\\mathbf{e}_r = \\lim_{\\Delta S \\to 0} \\frac{1}{\\Delta S} \\oint_{\\partial (\\Delta S)} \\mathbf{v}\\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell}$$\nWe construct an infinitesimal, coordinate-aligned rectangular-like loop on the spherical surface $r=R$ at a colatitude $\\theta$. For the area element $\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{S}$ to point in the outward radial direction $\\mathbf{e}_r$ (consistent with the right-hand rule, as $\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{S} = (R \\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta \\,\\mathbf{e}_\\theta) \\times (R \\sin\\theta \\,\\mathrm{d}\\phi \\,\\mathbf{e}_\\phi) = R^2 \\sin\\theta \\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta \\,\\mathrm{d}\\phi \\,\\mathbf{e}_r$), the boundary loop must be traversed in the order $(\\theta, \\phi) \\to (\\theta+\\mathrm{d}\\theta, \\phi) \\to (\\theta+\\mathrm{d}\\theta, \\phi+\\mathrm{d}\\phi) \\to (\\theta, \\phi+\\mathrm{d}\\phi) \\to (\\theta, \\phi)$. Let us calculate the line integral $\\oint \\mathbf{v}\\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell}$ over the four segments of this path. The velocity field on the surface is $\\mathbf{v} = V(R, \\theta)\\mathbf{e}_\\phi$.\n1.  Path from $(\\theta, \\phi)$ to $(\\theta+\\mathrm{d}\\theta, \\phi)$: The line element is $\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell} = R \\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta' \\,\\mathbf{e}_\\theta$. Since $\\mathbf{v}$ is purely in the $\\mathbf{e}_\\phi$ direction, $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_{\\theta} = 0$. The contribution is $0$.\n2.  Path from $(\\theta+\\mathrm{d}\\theta, \\phi)$ to $(\\theta+\\mathrm{d}\\theta, \\phi+\\mathrm{d}\\phi)$: The line element is $\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell} = R\\sin(\\theta+\\mathrm{d}\\theta) \\,\\mathrm{d}\\phi' \\,\\mathbf{e}_\\phi$.

The contribution is $-V(R,\\theta)R\\sin\\theta \\,\\mathrm{d}\\phi$.\n\nThe total circulation $\\mathrm{d}\\Gamma$ around the infinitesimal loop is the sum of these contributions:\n$$\\mathrm{d}\\Gamma = [V(R,\\theta+\\mathrm{d}\\theta)R\\sin(\\theta+\\mathrm{d}\\theta) - V(R,\\theta)R\\sin\\theta]\\,\\mathrm{d}\\phi$$\nLet $f(\\theta) = V(R,\\theta)R\\sin\\theta$. Using a first-order Taylor expansion, $f(\\theta+\\mathrm{d}\\theta) \\approx f(\\theta) + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta}\\mathrm{d}\\theta$, we get:\n$$\\mathrm{d}\\Gamma \\approx \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta}\\mathrm{d}\\theta \\, \\mathrm{d}\\phi = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}\\left(V(R,\\theta)R\\sin\\theta\\right)\\mathrm{d}\\theta \\, \\mathrm{d}\\phi$$\nThe area of the infinitesimal patch is $\\Delta S = (R \\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta)(R\\sin\\theta \\,\\mathrm{d}\\phi) = R^2\\sin\\theta \\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta \\,\\mathrm{d}\\phi$. Thus, the radial component of the curl is:\n$$(\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{v})\\cdot\\mathbf{e}_r = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\Gamma}{\\Delta S} = \\frac{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}[V(R,\\theta)R\\sin\\theta] \\mathrm{d}\\theta \\,\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{R^2\\sin\\theta \\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta \\,\\mathrm{d}\\phi} = \\frac{1}{R\\sin\\theta}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}[V(R,\\theta)\\sin\\theta]$$\nThis is the required expression.\n\n**Part 2: Evaluation of the surface integral and circulation**\n\nBy Stokes' theorem, the circulation $\\oint_C \\mathbf{v}\\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell}$ is equal to the flux of the curl through the surface $S$, $\\iint_S (\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{v})\\cdot\\mathbf{n} \\, \\mathrm{d}S$. We evaluate this surface integral.\nThe surface element on the sphere is $\\mathrm{d}S = R^2\\sin\\theta \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta \\, \\mathrm{d}\\phi$. The surface $S$ is defined by $r=R$, $0 \\le \\phi < 2\\pi$, and $0 \\le \\theta \\le \\theta_0$.\nThe integral is:\n$$ \\iint_S (\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{v})\\cdot\\mathbf{e}_r \\, \\mathrm{d}S = \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\int_0^{\\theta_0} \\left(\\frac{1}{R\\sin\\theta}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}[V(R,\\theta)\\sin\\theta]\\right) (R^2\\sin\\theta \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\phi $$\nThe term $R\\sin\\theta$ cancels out, simplifying the integral considerably:\n$$ \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\int_0^{\\theta_0} R\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}[V(R,\\theta)\\sin\\theta] \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta \\, \\mathrm{d}\\phi $$\nSince the integrand is independent of $\\phi$ (due to axisymmetry), the integration over $\\phi$ yields a factor of $2\\pi$:\n$$ 2\\pi R \\int_0^{\\theta_0} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}[V(R,\\theta)\\sin\\theta] \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta $$\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we integrate the derivative with respect to $\\theta$:\n$$ 2\\pi R \\left[V(R,\\theta)\\sin\\theta\\right]_{\\theta=0}^{\\theta=\\theta_0} = 2\\pi R (V(R,\\theta_0)\\sin\\theta_0 - V(R,0)\\sin 0) $$\nSince $\\sin 0 = 0$, the second term vanishes. Therefore, the value of the surface integral is $2\\pi R V(R,\\theta_0)\\sin\\theta_0$.\nBy Stokes' theorem, this is also the circulation:\n$$\\oint_C \\mathbf{v}\\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell} = 2\\pi R \\sin\\theta_0 V(R,\\theta_0)$$\n\n**Part 3: Specialization to rigid-body twist**\n\nWe are given the specific velocity profile for rigid-body rotation at the surface $r=R$:\n$$V(R,\\theta) = \\Omega R \\sin\\theta$$\nwhere $\\Omega$ is the constant angular speed. To find the circulation for this case, we substitute this expression into the result from Part $2$. First, we evaluate the velocity function at the boundary curve $C$, where $\\theta=\\theta_0$:\n$$V(R,\\theta_0) = \\Omega R \\sin\\theta_0$$\nNow, substitute this into the formula for the circulation:\n$$\\oint_C \\mathbf{v}\\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell} = 2\\pi R \\sin\\theta_0 (\\Omega R \\sin\\theta_0)$$\n$$\\oint_C \\mathbf{v}\\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell} = 2\\pi \\Omega R^2 \\sin^2\\theta_0$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the circulation. The units are $(\\text{time}^{-1})(\\text{length}^2)$, which is consistent with the problem's requirement.\nFinal check of the result: For rigid-body rotation $\\mathbf{v}=\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\times\\mathbf{r}$ with $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}=\\Omega\\mathbf{e}_z$, the curl is $2\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}=2\\Omega\\mathbf{e}_z$. The flux of the curl through the spherical cap is $\\iint_S (2\\Omega\\mathbf{e}_z) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_r \\, \\mathrm{d}S = \\iint_S 2\\Omega \\cos\\theta \\, (R^2 \\sin\\theta \\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta\\,\\mathrm{d}\\phi) = 2\\pi(2\\Omega R^2)\\int_0^{\\theta_0} \\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta \\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta = 4\\pi\\Omega R^2 [\\frac{1}{2}\\sin^2\\theta]_0^{\\theta_0} = 2\\pi\\Omega R^2\\sin^2\\theta_0$.

The constructs, including the smooth bump function, ensure that the vector fields are sufficiently differentiable for the required theorems to be applied.\n\nThe verdict is that the problem is **valid**. A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing the specified tasks in order.\n\nFirst, we establish that the vector field $\\mathbf{F}$ has compact support within the volume $V$.\nThe support of a vector field is the closure of the set of points where the field is nonzero. The vector potential is given by $\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\phi(\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|)\\,\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{x}$. By definition, the scalar function $\\phi(r)$ is identically zero for all $r \\ge \\rho$. This implies that $\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{0}$ for all $\\mathbf{x}$ such that $\\|\\mathbf{x}\\| \\ge \\rho$. The set where $\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{x})$ can be nonzero is the open ball $\\{ \\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 : \\|\\mathbf{x}\\| < \\rho \\}$. The support of $\\mathbf{A}$ is the closure of this set, which is the closed ball $\\overline{B_{\\rho}(\\mathbf{0})} = \\{ \\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 : \\|\\mathbf{x}\\| \\le \\rho \\}$. The vector field $\\mathbf{F}$ is the curl of $\\mathbf{A}$, $\\mathbf{F} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}$. Since $\\mathbf{A}$ is identically zero for $\\|\\mathbf{x}\\| \\ge \\rho$, all its partial derivatives are also zero in this region. Consequently, $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{x})$ must also be identically zero for $\\|\\mathbf{x}\\| \\ge \\rho$. The support of $\\mathbf{F}$ is therefore contained within the closed ball $\\overline{B_{\\rho}(\\mathbf{0})}$. In $\\mathbb{R}^3$, a set is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. The closed ball $\\overline{B_{\\rho}(\\mathbf{0})}$ is a closed and bounded set, hence it is compact. The problem states that $0 < \\rho < R$. This means that the compact support of $\\mathbf{F}$, $\\overline{B_{\\rho}(\\mathbf{0})}$, is a strict subset of the open ball $V = \\{ \\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 : \\|\\mathbf{x}\\| < R \\}$. The first task is thus established.\n\nSecond, we establish that the divergence of $\\mathbf{F}$ is zero.\nThe vector field is defined as the curl of the vector potential $\\mathbf{A}$, so $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{x})$. There exists a fundamental identity in vector calculus which states that for any twice continuously differentiable vector field, the divergence of its curl is identically zero. That is, for a field $\\mathbf{A} \\in C^2$, we have $\\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}) = 0$. The vector potential $\\mathbf{A}$ is constructed from the position vector $\\mathbf{x}$, the constant vector $\\mathbf{a}$, and the scalar function $\\phi(\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|)$. The bump function $\\phi(r)$ is smooth (infinitely differentiable) everywhere, including at $r = \\rho$ where all its derivatives are zero. The components of $\\mathbf{A}$ are therefore smooth functions of the coordinates $(x, y, z)$. As such, $\\mathbf{A}$ is twice continuously differentiable everywhere. Applying the identity, we find:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{F} = \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}) = 0\n$$\nThis holds for all $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, and therefore holds for all $\\mathbf{x}$ within the volume $V$. The second task is established.\n\nFinally, we compute the total outward flux $I$ using the divergence theorem. The problem explicitly demands the use of the divergence theorem, which relates the flux of a vector field through a closed surface to the integral of its divergence over the enclosed volume. The theorem states:\n$$\nI = \\int_{\\partial V} \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}\\, \\mathrm{d}S = \\int_{V} (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{F})\\, \\mathrm{d}V\n$$\nThe conditions for the theorem are met: $V$ is a simple solid region with a piecewise smooth boundary $\\partial V$, and the vector field $\\mathbf{F}$ is continuously differentiable on an open set containing $V$.\nAs established in the previous step, the divergence of $\\mathbf{F}$ is identically zero everywhere within $V$. Substituting $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{F} = 0$ into the volume integral:\n$$\nI = \\int_{V} 0 \\, \\mathrm{d}V\n$$\nThe integral of zero over any volume is zero. Therefore,\n$$\nI = 0\n$$\nThis result is a direct consequence of the fact that $\\mathbf{F}$ is a solenoidal field (divergence-free), which is guaranteed because it is defined as the curl of a potential. It is also consistent with the fact that $\\mathbf{F}$ vanishes on the boundary $\\partial V$, as shown in the analysis of its support. The integral of a zero vector field over a surface is necessarily zero. However, the reasoning must follow the specified path through the divergence theorem.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2643441"}, {"introduction": "The Gauss and Stokes theorems, while powerful, are not universally applicable; they rely on essential hypotheses about the regularity of the vector fields and the geometry of the domain.

Case (i) explores a field with a non-integrable singularity in its derivative, and Case (ii) explores a domain with a non-Lipschitz boundary. The questions are precise, objective, and well-posed within the framework of vector calculus and analysis. All definitions and data are provided. The problem is a standard, rigorous examination of fundamental mathematical principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\n**Analysis of Case (i)**\n\nWe are given the domain $\\Omega$ as the unit disk and the vector field $\\mathbf{v}(x,y) = (x/(x^2+y^2), y/(x^2+y^2))$ for $(x,y)\\neq(0,0)$.\n\nFirst, we compute the divergence of $\\mathbf{v}$ for $(x,y) \\neq (0,0)$. Let $\\mathbf{v} = (v_x, v_y)$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial v_x}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{x}{x^2+y^2}\\right) = \\frac{1(x^2+y^2) - x(2x)}{(x^2+y^2)^2} = \\frac{y^2-x^2}{(x^2+y^2)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial v_y}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}\\right) = \\frac{1(x^2+y^2) - y(2y)}{(x^2+y^2)^2} = \\frac{x^2-y^2}{(x^2+y^2)^2}\n$$\nThe divergence is the sum of these partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\frac{\\partial v_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v_y}{\\partial y} = \\frac{y^2-x^2}{(x^2+y^2)^2} + \\frac{x^2-y^2}{(x^2+y^2)^2} = 0\n$$\nThis holds for any $(x,y) \\neq (0,0)$. At the origin, the field is not differentiable.\n\nNow we compute the requested integrals.\n1.  The area integral $\\displaystyle \\int_{\\Omega \\setminus \\overline{B_{\\varepsilon}}} \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}\\, \\mathrm{d}A$:\n    Since $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0$ on the domain of integration $\\Omega \\setminus \\overline{B_{\\varepsilon}}$, the integral is zero.\n    $$\n    \\int_{\\Omega \\setminus \\overline{B_{\\varepsilon}}} \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}\\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{\\Omega \\setminus \\overline{B_{\\varepsilon}}} 0 \\, \\mathrm{d}A = 0\n    $$\n\n2.  The outward flux $\\displaystyle \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\mathbf{v}\\cdot \\mathbf{n}\\, \\mathrm{d}s$:\n    The boundary $\\partial\\Omega$ is the unit circle $x^2+y^2=1$. The outward unit normal is $\\mathbf{n}=(x,y)/ \\sqrt{x^2+y^2} = (x,y)$. On this boundary, the field is $\\mathbf{v}(x,y) = (x,y)/(x^2+y^2) = (x,y)$.\n    The integrand is $\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{n} = (x,y) \\cdot (x,y) = x^2+y^2 = 1$.\n    The flux is therefore:\n    $$\n    \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\mathbf{v}\\cdot \\mathbf{n}\\, \\mathrm{d}s = \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} 1 \\, \\mathrm{d}s = \\text{length}(\\partial\\Omega) = 2\\pi(1) = 2\\pi\n    $$\n\n3.  The outward flux $\\displaystyle \\int_{C_{\\varepsilon}} \\mathbf{v}\\cdot \\mathbf{n}\\, \\mathrm{d}s$:\n    The boundary $C_{\\varepsilon}$ is the circle $x^2+y^2=\\varepsilon^2$. The normal $\\mathbf{n}$ is outward relative to the annulus $\\Omega \\setminus \\overline{B_{\\varepsilon}}$, which means it points towards the origin, into the disk $B_{\\varepsilon}$. The standard outward normal from $B_{\\varepsilon}$ is $(x,y)/\\varepsilon$, so our normal is $\\mathbf{n} = -(x,y)/\\varepsilon$. On $C_{\\varepsilon}$, the field is $\\mathbf{v}(x,y) = (x,y)/(x^2+y^2) = (x,y)/\\varepsilon^2$.\n    The integrand is $\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{n} = \\left(\\frac{(x,y)}{\\varepsilon^2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{(x,y)}{\\varepsilon}\\right) = -\\frac{x^2+y^2}{\\varepsilon^3} = -\\frac{\\varepsilon^2}{\\varepsilon^3} = -\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}$.\n    The flux is:\n    $$\n    \\int_{C_{\\varepsilon}} \\mathbf{v}\\cdot \\mathbf{n}\\, \\mathrm{d}s = \\int_{C_{\\varepsilon}} \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}s = -\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} \\cdot \\text{length}(C_{\\varepsilon}) = -\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} \\cdot (2\\pi\\varepsilon) = -2\\pi\n    $$\n\nAs a check, the Divergence Theorem on the non-singular annulus $\\Omega \\setminus \\overline{B_{\\varepsilon}}$ states that the volume integral of the divergence must equal the total flux across its boundary, $\\partial\\Omega \\cup C_{\\varepsilon}$. We find $0 = 2\\pi + (-2\\pi)$, which is correct.\n\nThe problem asks to analyze the failure of the standard proof which removes the singularity. The proof would proceed by taking the limit as $\\varepsilon \\to 0^+$. The identity on the annulus is:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega \\setminus \\overline{B_{\\varepsilon}}} \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}\\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} \\mathbf{v}\\cdot \\mathbf{n}\\, \\mathrm{d}s + \\int_{C_{\\varepsilon}} \\mathbf{v}\\cdot \\mathbf{n}\\, \\mathrm{d}s\n$$\nThe standard proof of the Divergence Theorem for a singular field assumes one can write:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}\\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\lim_{\\varepsilon\\to 0^+} \\int_{\\Omega \\setminus \\overline{B_{\\varepsilon}}} \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}\\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} \\mathbf{v}\\cdot \\mathbf{n}\\, \\mathrm{d}s - \\lim_{\\varepsilon\\to 0^+} \\left(-\\int_{C_{\\varepsilon}} \\mathbf{v}\\cdot \\mathbf{n}\\, \\mathrm{d}s\\right)\n$$\nA key step that is often assumed is that the flux through the shrinking hole vanishes: $\\lim_{\\varepsilon\\to 0^+} \\int_{C_{\\varepsilon}} \\mathbf{v}\\cdot \\mathbf{n}\\, \\mathrm{d}s = 0$. In our case, this limit is $-2\\pi$, not $0$. This is the step that fails. The flux through the singularity is non-zero. The \"leakage\" at the origin accounts for the discrepancy.\nIf one naively computes $\\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} \\, dA$, one gets $\\int_{\\Omega} 0 \\, dA = 0$, since $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}=0$ almost everywhere. The flux across the outer boundary $\\partial\\Omega$ is $2\\pi$. The equality $0 = 2\\pi$ is false. The theorem in its classical form fails. The reason is the insufficient regularity of $\\mathbf{v}$. A field must belong to the Sobolev space $W^{1,1}(\\Omega)$ for a generalized Divergence Theorem to hold. The derivatives of $\\mathbf{v}$ are of order $1/r^2$. The integral of $|1/r^2|$ in 2D with the measure $r\\,dr\\,d\\theta$ gives an integral of $1/r$, which diverges near $r=0$. Thus, $\\mathbf{v} \\notin W^{1,1}(\\Omega)$.\n\n**Analysis of Case (ii)**\n\nWe are given the cusp domain $\\Omega_{p} = \\{(x,y) : 0<x<1, |y|<x^{p}\\}$ for $p \\in (0,1)$ and the constant field $\\mathbf{w}=(1,0)$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the geometric hypothesis. The standard proof of the Divergence Theorem, particularly when using slicing methods, relies on the boundary being locally a Lipschitz graph. The boundary of $\\Omega_p$ near the origin is described by the functions $y = f(x) = x^p$ and $y = g(x) = -x^p$.\nFor a function to be Lipschitz on an interval containing $0$, its derivative must be bounded in a neighborhood of $0$. Let us examine $f(x)=x^p$:\n$$\nf'(x) = px^{p-1}\n$$\nSince $p \\in (0,1)$, the exponent $p-1$ is negative. As $x \\to 0^+$, $x^{p-1} \\to \\infty$. The derivative is unbounded. Therefore, the boundary of $\\Omega_p$ is not a Lipschitz graph near the origin. This is the failing geometric hypothesis in the standard proof.\n\nNext, we check if this failure invalidates the identity. We compute both sides of the Divergence Theorem for $\\mathbf{w}=(1,0)$ on $\\Omega_p$.\n1.  LHS: The volume integral of the divergence.\n    $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = \\frac{\\partial(1)}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial(0)}{\\partial y} = 0$.\n    $$\n    \\int_{\\Omega_p} \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{w} \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{\\Omega_p} 0 \\, \\mathrm{d}A = 0\n    $$\n\n2.  RHS: The flux integral over the boundary $\\int_{\\partial\\Omega_p} \\mathbf{w}\\cdot \\mathbf{n}\\, ds$.\n    We can compute this using the identity $\\int_{\\partial\\Omega_p} \\mathbf{w}\\cdot \\mathbf{n}\\, ds = \\oint_{\\partial\\Omega_p} w_x dy - w_y dx$, where the line integral is taken counter-clockwise. For $\\mathbf{w}=(1,0)$, this becomes $\\oint_{\\partial\\Omega_p} 1 \\, dy$.\n    The boundary consists of three parts:\n    - The lower curve from $(0,0)$ to $(1,-1)$: $y=-x^p$, $x$ from $0$ to $1$. The integral is $\\int_0^1 d(-x^p) = \\int_0^1 -px^{p-1} dx = [-x^p]_0^1 = -1$.\n    - The right edge from $(1,-1)$ to $(1,1)$: $x=1$, $y$ from $-1$ to $1$. The integral is $\\int_{-1}^1 dy = [y]_{-1}^1 = 2$.\n    - The upper curve from $(1,1)$ to $(0,0)$: $y=x^p$, $x$ from $1$ to $0$. The integral is $\\int_1^0 d(x^p) = \\int_1^0 px^{p-1} dx = [x^p]_1^0 = -1$.\n    The total flux is the sum of these values:\n    $$\n    \\int_{\\partial \\Omega_p} \\mathbf{w}\\cdot \\mathbf{n}\\, \\mathrm{d}s = -1 + 2 - 1 = 0\n    $$\nWe find that LHS = $0$ and RHS = $0$. The global balance identity holds, even though the boundary is not Lipschitz. This implies that the Lipschitz condition is a sufficient, but not necessary, condition for the theorem to hold, at least for very regular fields like this constant one. Modern extensions of the Divergence Theorem apply to domains with less regular boundaries, such as sets of finite perimeter (also known as Caccioppoli sets), for which a measure-theoretic normal can be defined. The domain $\\Omega_p$ is such a set.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nA. In Case (i), the missing inner-boundary contribution $\\displaystyle \\int_{C_{\\varepsilon}} \\mathbf{v}\\cdot \\mathbf{n}\\, \\mathrm{d}s$ does not vanish as $\\varepsilon \\to 0^{+}$, so the step in the proof that discards the inner flux fails. The breakdown is equivalently that $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}\\notin L^{1}(\\Omega)$ (and $\\mathbf{v}\\notin W^{1,1}(\\Omega)$), so the excision-and-limit argument is not justified.\n- Our analysis shows that the flux on $C_\\varepsilon$ is a constant $-2\\pi$, which does not vanish. This is the failure of the excision argument. We also verified that the derivatives of $\\mathbf{v}$ are not in $L^1(\\Omega)$, thus $\\mathbf{v} \\notin W^{1,1}(\\Omega)$, which is the fundamental reason for the failure of the generalized theorem. The distributional divergence involves a Dirac delta, which is not an $L^1$ function. This statement is entirely correct.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. In Case (i), since $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}=0$ for almost every point, the global balance still holds in the classical sense and any discrepancy must be a computation mistake.\n- This is incorrect. The fact that $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}=0$ almost everywhere is precisely what leads to the apparent paradox when one ignores the singularity. We calculated $\\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} \\, dA = 0$ (naively) while $\\int_{\\partial\\Omega} \\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{n}\\,ds = 2\\pi$. The balance does *not* hold in the classical sense. The reasoning is flawed.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. In Case (ii), the outward unit normal is undefined on a set of positive boundary measure, so the global balance necessarily fails for all constant fields $\\mathbf{w}$ on $\\Omega_{p}$.\n- The outward unit normal is well-defined everywhere on the boundary except at the single point $(0,0)$. A single point has boundary measure (length) zero. The premise is false. Furthermore, we explicitly showed that for $\\mathbf{w}=(1,0)$, the balance identity *holds*. The conclusion is also false.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. In Case (ii), the standard proof breaks because the boundary near the cusp is not a Lipschitz graph (the slope blows up), so the trace theorem and the one-dimensional slicing step are not directly applicable. Nevertheless, an extension of the balance to sets of finite perimeter and measure-theoretic normals can still validate the identity for sufficiently regular fields such as constant $\\mathbf{w}$.\n- Our analysis confirms every part of this statement. The boundary is not Lipschitz. This invalidates assumptions in standard proofs. However, the identity itself can still hold, as confirmed by our direct calculation. The theory of sets of finite perimeter provides the rigorous framework for this extension, and a constant field is certainly regular enough.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2643452"}]}
