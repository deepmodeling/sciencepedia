First, we validate the problem statement.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Domain**: Small-strain solid mechanics, $3$-dimensional Cartesian frame.\n- **Tensors**: $A_{ij}$ (second-order), $B_{ij}$ (second-order), $C_{j}$ (vector, i.e., first-order).\n- **Rules (Einstein Summation Convention)**:\n    1. An index appearing exactly twice in a single term is a dummy index and is summed.\n    2. An index appearing exactly once in a single term is a free index.\n    3. No index may appear more than twice in a single term.\n- **Expression for Assessment**: $A_{ij}B_{ik}C_{j}$\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as it pertains to tensor algebra using index notation, a fundamental concept in mechanics and physics. The provided rules are the standard definition of the Einstein summation convention for Cartesian tensors. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It contains no scientific flaws, ambiguities, or contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation and Option Analysis**\n\nThe expression to be evaluated is $A_{ij}B_{ik}C_{j}$. This constitutes a single term. We apply the given rules meticulously.\n\n1.  **Index Count**:\n    - The index $i$ appears twice (in $A_{ij}$ and $B_{ik}$). Therefore, $i$ is a dummy index and is to be summed from $1$ to $3$.\n    - The index $j$ appears twice (in $A_{ij}$ and $C_{j}$). Therefore, $j$ is a dummy index and is to be summed from $1$ to $3$.\n    - The index $k$ appears once (in $B_{ik}$). Therefore, $k$ is a free index. It is not summed and must appear on the resultant object.\n\n2.  **Rule Compliance**:\n    - Each dummy index ($i$, $j$) appears exactly twice. This complies with Rule 1.\n    - The free index ($k$) appears exactly once. This complies with Rule 2.\n    - No index appears more than twice. This complies with Rule 3.\n\n**Conclusion**: The expression $A_{ij}B_{ik}C_{j}$ is a valid construction under the provided rules of the Einstein summation convention. Because it has one free index ($k$), it represents the components of a first-order tensor, which is a vector. The explicit summation form is $\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\sum_{j=1}^{3} A_{ij}B_{ik}C_{j}$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. There is no violation. The expression $A_{ij}B_{ik}C_{j}$ is a valid contraction with free index $k$ (it represents a vector). An explicit parenthesized form that emphasizes valid dummy-index contractions is $B_{ik}\\!\\left(A_{ij}C_{j}\\right)$.**\n\n- **\"There is no violation\"**: This is correct, as established by our analysis.\n- **\"...valid contraction with free index $k$ (it represents a vector)\"**: This is also correct. The summations over dummy indices $i$ and $j$ are contractions that reduce the tensor rank. The single free index $k$ signifies a vector.\n- **\"...parenthesized form... is $B_{ik}\\!\\left(A_{ij}C_{j}\\right)$\"**: Let us analyze the term in parentheses, $D_i = A_{ij}C_j$. This is a valid tensor contraction representing a matrix-vector product, resulting in a vector $D_i$. The full expression then becomes $B_{ik}D_i$. This is another valid contraction, resulting in a vector with free index $k$. Since multiplication of tensor components (which are scalars) is associative and commutative, $A_{ij}B_{ik}C_{j} = B_{ik}A_{ij}C_{j} = B_{ik}(A_{ij}C_{j})$. This grouping correctly represents a valid sequence of operations that yields the original expression.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. There is a violation because the index $k$ appears only once. To fix it, rename the index in $C_{j}$ so that it pairs with $k$, giving $A_{ij}B_{ik}C_{k}$.**\n\n- **\"There is a violation because the index $k$ appears only once\"**: This is a fundamentally incorrect statement. An index appearing once is, by definition, a free index. It is not a violation. This premise demonstrates a misunderstanding of the convention.\n- **\"To fix it... giving $A_{ij}B_{ik}C_{k}$\"**: This proposed expression has a free index $j$ and dummy indices $i$ and $k$. While it is a valid expression for a vector, it is an entirely different quantity from the original expression, which has $k$ as its free index. The justification is flawed, and the \"fix\" alters the original problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. There is a violation because the index $i$ is split across two factors. To fix it, route the sum through a single adjacent factor by rewriting as $A_{ij}B_{jk}C_{j}$.**\n\n- **\"There is a violation because the index $i$ is split across two factors\"**: This is false. A dummy index indicates a summation over all factors in the term. There is no rule requiring dummy indices to appear on adjacent factors. The summation $\\sum_i A_{ij}B_{ik}$ is perfectly well-defined.\n- **\"...rewriting as $A_{ij}B_{jk}C_{j}$\"**: Let us inspect this proposed expression. The index $j$ appears three times (in $A_{ij}$, $B_{jk}$, and $C_j$). This is a direct violation of Rule 3: \"no index may appear more than twice in a single term.\" The proposed \"fix\" is an invalid expression.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. There is a violation because the dummy index $j$ appears twice across nonadjacent factors. To fix it, rename one $j$ to avoid double counting, yielding $A_{im}B_{ik}C_{j}$.**\n\n- **\"There is a violation because the dummy index $j$ appears twice across nonadjacent factors\"**: As with option C, this is an invented rule. The position of factors is irrelevant for summation due to the commutative property of scalar multiplication. The expression $A_{ij}B_{ik}C_j$ is equivalent to $A_{ij}C_j B_{ik}$, where the dummy index $j$ appears on adjacent factors.\n- **\"...yielding $A_{im}B_{ik}C_{j}$\"**: Let us inspect this expression. The indices are $i$ (dummy), $m$ (free), $k$ (free), and $j$ (free). The result is a third-order tensor with components $T_{mkj}$. The original expression was a first-order tensor (a vector). This \"fix\" fundamentally changes the rank and meaning of the expression.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. There is a violation because both repeated indices are subscripts. In Euclidean solid mechanics, summation requires one upper and one lower index. A valid rewrite is $A^{i}{}_{j}B_{ik}C^{j}$.**\n\n- **\"There is a violation because both repeated indices are subscripts\"**: The problem is specified in a \"Cartesian frame in a $3$-dimensional Euclidean space\". In such a framework, the metric tensor is the identity matrix ($g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$), and there is no distinction between covariant (subscript) and contravariant (superscript) components. It is standard and acceptable practice to write all indices as subscripts. The rule of summing over one upper and one lower index is essential for general curvilinear coordinates to ensure coordinate invariance, but it is not a requirement in a Cartesian system. The rules provided in the problem statement itself make no mention of this distinction. One must adhere to the rules as given.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nIn summary, only option A correctly analyzes the expression according to the established rules of index notation in a Cartesian system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2648752"}, {"introduction": "Index notation offers a powerful and compact way to represent complex summations that arise in continuum mechanics.

We now proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe task is to compute two derivatives of scalar functions of a second-order tensor $A$ with components $A_{ij}$. The components $A_{ij}$ are treated as independent variables. We are given the identity for the derivative of one component with respect to another:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial A_{mn}}{\\partial A_{ij}} = \\delta_{mi}\\delta_{nj}\n$$\nHere, $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta, which is equal to $1$ if $i=j$ and $0$ if $i \\neq j$. The Einstein summation convention is in effect for repeated indices.\n\nFirst, we will compute the derivative of the first invariant, $I_{1}$, defined as the trace of the tensor $A$.\nThe definition of $I_{1}$ is given as:\n$$\nI_{1} = A_{kk} = A_{11} + A_{22} + A_{33}\n$$\nWe differentiate $I_{1}$ with respect to a generic component $A_{ij}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial I_{1}}{\\partial A_{ij}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial A_{ij}}(A_{kk})\n$$\nUsing the provided differentiation rule with $m=k$ and $n=k$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial A_{kk}}{\\partial A_{ij}} = \\delta_{ki}\\delta_{kj}\n$$\nThe expression $\\delta_{ki}\\delta_{kj}$ involves a summation over the index $k$.

The expression becomes $\\delta_{ki}\\delta_{ki}$. In the sum, only the term where $k=i$ will be non-zero. For example, if $i=j=1$, the sum is $\\delta_{11}\\delta_{11} + \\delta_{21}\\delta_{21} + \\delta_{31}\\delta_{31} = (1)(1) + (0)(0) + (0)(0) = 1$.
