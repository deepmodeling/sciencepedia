It presents a standard problem in continuum mechanics that is solvable with the provided data. The normal vectors $\\boldsymbol{n}_{1}$, $\\boldsymbol{n}_{2}$, and $\\boldsymbol{n}_{3}$ are linearly independent, as the determinant of the matrix $[\\boldsymbol{n}_{1} \\boldsymbol{n}_{2} \\boldsymbol{n}_{3}]$ is non-zero. This guarantees that sufficient information is provided to uniquely determine the six independent components of the symmetric stress tensor. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe foundation of this problem is Cauchy's stress principle, which postulates that the traction vector $\\boldsymbol{t}$ acting on a surface with unit normal $\\boldsymbol{n}$ at a point $P$ is a function of $P$ and $\\boldsymbol{n}$ only, i.e., $\\boldsymbol{t} = \\boldsymbol{t}(P, \\boldsymbol{n})$. The existence of a linear mapping from $\\boldsymbol{n}$ to $\\boldsymbol{t}$ is established by Cauchy's theorem, derived from the balance of linear momentum.\n\nConsider an infinitesimal tetrahedron at point $P$ with three faces orthogonal to the Cartesian basis vectors $\\boldsymbol{e}_{1}, \\boldsymbol{e}_{2}, \\boldsymbol{e}_{3}$ and an oblique face with outward unit normal $\\boldsymbol{n}$ and area $\\Delta A$. The areas of the other three faces are $\\Delta A_i = (\\boldsymbol{n} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{e}_i) \\Delta A = n_i \\Delta A$. The balance of linear momentum, neglecting body forces and inertial terms which vanish faster as the volume shrinks to zero, requires that the sum of surface forces is zero:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{t}(\\boldsymbol{n})\\Delta A + \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\boldsymbol{t}(-\\boldsymbol{e}_{i}) \\Delta A_{i} = \\boldsymbol{0}\n$$\nBy Newton's third law, $\\boldsymbol{t}(-\\boldsymbol{n}) = -\\boldsymbol{t}(\\boldsymbol{n})$. Substituting this and $\\Delta A_i = n_i \\Delta A$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{t}(\\boldsymbol{n}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} n_{i} \\boldsymbol{t}(\\boldsymbol{e}_{i})\n$$\nThis demonstrates that $\\boldsymbol{t}(\\boldsymbol{n})$ is a linear function of the components of $\\boldsymbol{n}$. We define the second-order Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ whose columns are the traction vectors acting on the coordinate planes.

Furthermore, the balance of angular momentum in the absence of body couples requires the stress tensor to be symmetric, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^T$, which means $\\sigma_{ij} = \\sigma_{ji}$. This reduces the number of independent components from $9$ to $6$. The symmetric stress tensor is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{11} & \\sigma_{12} & \\sigma_{13} \\\\ \\sigma_{12} & \\sigma_{22} & \\sigma_{23} \\\\ \\sigma_{13} & \\sigma_{23} & \\sigma_{33} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe traction boundary conditions for the three faces are formulated using Cauchy's formula:\n1. $\\boldsymbol{t}_{1} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\boldsymbol{n}_{1}$\n2. $\\boldsymbol{t}_{2} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\boldsymbol{n}_{2}$\n3. $\\boldsymbol{t}_{3} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\boldsymbol{n}_{3}$\n\nWe now use this system of equations to determine the six unknown components of $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$.

The numerical values are physically plausible. The problem is deemed valid.\n\nWe begin with the theoretical derivation. The objective is to show that the traction vector $t$ acting on an arbitrary plane with unit normal $n$ at a point $P$ is a linear function of $n$. This relationship is established through the existence of a second-order tensor, the Cauchy stress tensor $\\sigma$.\n\nConsider an infinitesimal tetrahedron at point $P$, with three faces perpendicular to the Cartesian coordinate axes $x_1, x_2, x_3$ and a fourth, oblique face with an outward unit normal vector $n$. Let the area of the oblique face be $dA$. The areas of the faces with outward normals $-e_1, -e_2, -e_3$ are $dA_1 = (n \\cdot e_1)dA = n_1 dA$, $dA_2 = n_2 dA$, and $dA_3 = n_3 dA$, respectively. Let $h$ be the perpendicular distance from the vertex at $P$ to the oblique face. The volume of the tetrahedron is $dV = \\frac{1}{3} h dA$.\n\nThe balance of linear momentum (Newton's second law) for this infinitesimal body is stated in integral form as:\n$$\n\\int_{\\partial V} t \\, dS + \\int_{V} b \\, dV = \\int_{V} \\rho a \\, dV\n$$\nwhere $t$ is the traction vector on the surface $\\partial V$, $b$ is the body force per unit volume, $\\rho$ is the mass density, and $a$ is the acceleration.\n\nApplying this to our tetrahedron, the surface integral is a sum of forces on the four faces:\n$$\nt(n) dA + t(-e_1) dA_1 + t(-e_2) dA_2 + t(-e_3) dA_3 + b_{avg} dV = \\rho_{avg} a_{avg} dV\n$$\nBy Cauchy's action-reaction postulate, $t(-v) = -t(v)$ for any vector $v$. Substituting this and the expressions for $dA_i$ and $dV$:\n$$\nt(n) dA - t(e_1) n_1 dA - t(e_2) n_2 dA - t(e_3) n_3 dA + (b_{avg} - \\rho_{avg} a_{avg}) \\frac{1}{3} h dA = 0\n$$\nDividing by the area $dA$ yields:\n$$\nt(n) - \\sum_{i=1}^{3} n_i t(e_i) + \\frac{h}{3} (b_{avg} - \\rho_{avg} a_{avg}) = 0\n$$\nTo describe the state of stress *at the point* $P$, we shrink the tetrahedron to the point by taking the limit as $h \\to 0$. In this limit, the term proportional to $h$ vanishes. We are left with what is known as Cauchy's lemma:\n$$\nt(n) = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} n_j t(e_j)\n$$\nThis fundamental result demonstrates that the traction vector $t(n)$ on any plane is a linear combination of the traction vectors on the three mutually orthogonal coordinate planes, with the components of the normal vector $n$ serving as the coefficients. This is the linear dependence we sought.\n\nTo express this in terms of a tensor, we define the components of the Cauchy stress tensor $\\sigma$. Let $\\sigma_{ij}$ be the $i$-th component of the traction vector acting on the plane whose normal is the basis vector $e_j$. That is, $t(e_j) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\sigma_{ij} e_i$.\nSubstituting this definition into Cauchy's lemma:\n$$\nt(n) = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} n_j \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\sigma_{ij} e_i \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\sigma_{ij} n_j \\right) e_i\n$$\nThe $i$-th component of the traction vector $t(n)$ is therefore:\n$$\nt_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\sigma_{ij} n_j\n$$\nThis is the component form of the matrix-vector equation $t = \\sigma n$, known as Cauchy's formula. This establishes the existence of the sought-after second-order tensor $\\sigma$.\nFurthermore, the balance of angular momentum, applied to an infinitesimal cubic element, requires that $\\sigma_{ij} = \\sigma_{ji}$ in the absence of body couples. The stress tensor is symmetric, as is the case for the one provided in the problem.\n\nThe problem then defines the scalar shear component along a prescribed in-plane unit direction $m$ as the projection of the traction vector $t$ onto $m$. This is given by the dot product:\n$$\nt_s^{(m)} = t \\cdot m\n$$\nSince $m$ is an in-plane direction, it is orthogonal to the normal $n$, i.e., $m \\cdot n = 0$. The traction vector $t$ can be decomposed into a normal component, $t_n = (t \\cdot n)n$, and a shear component, $t_s = t - t_n$. The projection of the shear component $t_s$ onto $m$ is $t_s \\cdot m = (t - (t \\cdot n)n) \\cdot m = t \\cdot m - (t \\cdot n)(n \\cdot m)$. As $n \\cdot m=0$, this simplifies to $t_s \\cdot m = t \\cdot m$.

Let the components of the Cauchy stress tensor be:\n$$ \\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{11} & \\sigma_{12} & \\sigma_{13} \\\\ \\sigma_{21} & \\sigma_{22} & \\sigma_{23} \\\\ \\sigma_{31} & \\sigma_{32} & \\sigma_{33} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nDue to symmetry, $\\sigma_{12}=\\sigma_{21}$, $\\sigma_{13}=\\sigma_{31}$, and $\\sigma_{23}=\\sigma_{32}$.\n\nUsing the first data pair, $\\boldsymbol{n}^{(1)} = (1, 0, 0)^T$ and $\\boldsymbol{t}^{(1)} = (12, 3, -2)^T$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 12 \\\\ 3 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{11} & \\sigma_{12} & \\sigma_{13} \\\\ \\sigma_{21} & \\sigma_{22} & \\sigma_{23} \\\\ \\sigma_{31} & \\sigma_{32} & \\sigma_{33} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{11} \\\\ \\sigma_{21} \\\\ \\sigma_{31} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis gives the first column of $\\sigma$: $\\sigma_{11}=12$, $\\sigma_{21}=3$, $\\sigma_{31}=-2$. By symmetry, we also know $\\sigma_{12}=3$ and $\\sigma_{13}=-2$. The tensor is now partially determined:\n$$ \\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix} 12 & 3 & -2 \\\\ 3 & \\sigma_{22} & \\sigma_{23} \\\\ -2 & \\sigma_{23} & \\sigma_{33} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nwhere we have also used $\\sigma_{32}=\\sigma_{23}$.\n\nUsing the second data pair, $\\boldsymbol{n}^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1, 1, 0)^T$ and $\\boldsymbol{t}^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(15, 13, 2)^T$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ 13 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 12 & 3 & -2 \\\\ 3 & \\sigma_{22} & \\sigma_{23} \\\\ -2 & \\sigma_{23} & \\sigma_{33} \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) $$\nMultiplying by $\\sqrt{2}$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ 13 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 12 \\cdot 1 + 3 \\cdot 1 \\\\ 3 \\cdot 1 + \\sigma_{22} \\cdot 1 \\\\ -2 \\cdot 1 + \\sigma_{23} \\cdot 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 15 \\\\ 3 + \\sigma_{22} \\\\ -2 + \\sigma_{23} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe first row, $15=15$, confirms consistency. The second row gives $13 = 3 + \\sigma_{22}$, so $\\sigma_{22}=10$. The third row gives $2 = -2 + \\sigma_{23}$, so $\\sigma_{23}=4$.\nThe tensor is now:\n$$ \\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix} 12 & 3 & -2 \\\\ 3 & 10 & 4 \\\\ -2 & 4 & \\sigma_{33} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nUsing the third data pair, $\\boldsymbol{n}^{(3)} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(0, 1, 1)^T$ and $\\boldsymbol{t}^{(3)} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1, 14, 12)^T$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 14 \\\\ 12 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 12 & 3 & -2 \\\\ 3 & 10 & 4 \\\\ -2 & 4 & \\sigma_{33} \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) $$\nMultiplying by $\\sqrt{2}$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 14 \\\\ 12 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\cdot 1 - 2 \\cdot 1 \\\\ 10 \\cdot 1 + 4 \\cdot 1 \\\\ 4 \\cdot 1 + \\sigma_{33} \\cdot 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 14 \\\\ 4 + \\sigma_{33} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe first two rows, $1=1$ and $14=14$, confirm consistency. The third row gives $12 = 4 + \\sigma_{33}$, so $\\sigma_{33}=8$.\nThe Cauchy stress tensor is completely determined:\n$$ \\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix} 12 & 3 & -2 \\\\ 3 & 10 & 4 \\\\ -2 & 4 & 8 \\end{pmatrix} \\text{MPa} $$\n\nNext, we derive the relationship for the First Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor $P$. The force element $d\\boldsymbol{f}$ on a surface element is invariant. In the current configuration, it is $d\\boldsymbol{f} = \\boldsymbol{t} da = (\\sigma \\boldsymbol{n}) da = \\sigma (d\\boldsymbol{a})$, where $d\\boldsymbol{a} = \\boldsymbol{n} da$ is the oriented area element. In the reference configuration, $d\\boldsymbol{f} = \\boldsymbol{T} dA = (P \\boldsymbol{N}) dA = P(d\\boldsymbol{A})$, where $\\boldsymbol{T}$ is the nominal traction and $d\\boldsymbol{A} = \\boldsymbol{N} dA$.\nEquating the expressions for $d\\boldsymbol{f}$:\n$$ P d\\boldsymbol{A} = \\sigma d\\boldsymbol{a} $$\nThe area elements are related by Nanson's formula: $d\\boldsymbol{a} = J F^{-T} d\\boldsymbol{A}$, where $J = \\det(F)$.\nSubstituting this into the force balance gives:\n$$ P d\\boldsymbol{A} = \\sigma (J F^{-T} d\\boldsymbol{A}) $$\nSince this relation must hold for an arbitrary area element $d\\boldsymbol{A}$, we obtain the tensor equation:\n$$ P = J \\sigma F^{-T} $$\nTo evaluate this, we compute $J$ and $F^{-T}$.\nThe determinant of $F$ is:\n$$ J = \\det(F) = 1.2(0.9 \\cdot 1.1 - 0.3 \\cdot (-0.2)) - 0.2(0.0 \\cdot 1.1 - 0.3 \\cdot 0.1) - 0.1(0.0 \\cdot (-0.2) - 0.9 \\cdot 0.1) $$\n$$ J = 1.2(1.05) - 0.2(-0.03) - 0.1(-0.09) = 1.26 + 0.006 + 0.009 = 1.275 $$\nThe inverse transpose $F^{-T}$ is related to the cofactor matrix of $F$, denoted $\\text{cof}(F)$, by $F^{-T} = \\frac{1}{J} \\text{cof}(F)$.\nThe expression for $P$ simplifies to:\n$$ P = J \\sigma \\left(\\frac{1}{J} \\text{cof}(F)\\right) = \\sigma \\, \\text{cof}(F) $$\nThe components of the cofactor matrix $C_{ij}$ are computed.\n$C_{11} = 0.9(1.1) - 0.3(-0.2) = 1.05$\n$C_{12} = -(0.0(1.1) - 0.3(0.1)) = 0.03$\n$C_{13} = 0.0(-0.2) - 0.9(0.1) = -0.09$\n$C_{21} = -(0.2(1.1) - (-0.1)(-0.2)) = -0.20$\n$C_{22} = 1.2(1.1) - (-0.1)(0.1) = 1.33$\n$C_{23} = -(1.2(-0.2) - 0.2(0.1)) = 0.26$\n$C_{31} = 0.2(0.3) - (-0.1)(0.9) = 0.15$\n$C_{32} = -(1.2(0.3) - (-0.1)(0.0)) = -0.36$\n$C_{33} = 1.2(0.9) - 0.2(0.0) = 1.08$\nSo, the cofactor matrix is:\n$$ \\text{cof}(F) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.05 & 0.03 & -0.09 \\\\ -0.20 & 1.33 & 0.26 \\\\ 0.15 & -0.36 & 1.08 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow we compute the matrix product $P = \\sigma \\, \\text{cof}(F)$:\n$$ P = \\begin{pmatrix} 12 & 3 & -2 \\\\ 3 & 10 & 4 \\\\ -2 & 4 & 8 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1.05 & 0.03 & -0.09 \\\\ -0.20 & 1.33 & 0.26 \\\\ 0.15 & -0.36 & 1.08 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$P_{11} = 12(1.05) + 3(-0.20) - 2(0.15) = 12.6 - 0.6 - 0.3 = 11.7$\n$P_{12} = 12(0.03) + 3(1.33) - 2(-0.36) = 0.36 + 3.99 + 0.72 = 5.07$\n$P_{13} = 12(-0.09) + 3(0.26) - 2(1.08) = -1.08 + 0.78 - 2.16 = -2.46$\n\n$P_{21} = 3(1.05) + 10(-0.20) + 4(0.15) = 3.15 - 2.0 + 0.6 = 1.75$\n$P_{22} = 3(0.03) + 10(1.33) + 4(-0.36) = 0.09 + 13.3 - 1.44 = 11.95$\n$P_{23} = 3(-0.09) + 10(0.26) + 4(1.08) = -0.27 + 2.6 + 4.32 = 6.65$\n\n$P_{31} = -2(1.05) + 4(-0.20) + 8(0.15) = -2.1 - 0.8 + 1.2 = -1.7$\n$P_{32} = -2(0.03) + 4(1.33) + 8(-0.36) = -0.06 + 5.32 - 2.88 = 2.38$\n$P_{33} = -2(-0.09) + 4(0.26) + 8(1.08) = 0.18 + 1.04 + 8.64 = 9.86$\n\nThe First Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor is:\n$$ P = \\begin{pmatrix} 11.7 & 5.07 & -2.46 \\\\ 1.75 & 11.95 & 6.65 \\\\ -1.7 & 2.38 & 9.86 \\end{pmatrix} \\text{MPa} $$\nRounding each entry to four significant figures as required:\n$$ P = \\begin{pmatrix} 11.70 & 5.070 & -2.460 \\\\ 1.750 & 11.95 & 6.650 \\\\ -1.700 & 2.380 & 9.860 \\end{pmatrix} \\text{MPa} $$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n11.70 & 5.070 & -2.460 \\\\\n1.750 & 11.95 & 6.650 \\\\\n-1.700 & 2.380 & 9.860\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2621541"}]}
