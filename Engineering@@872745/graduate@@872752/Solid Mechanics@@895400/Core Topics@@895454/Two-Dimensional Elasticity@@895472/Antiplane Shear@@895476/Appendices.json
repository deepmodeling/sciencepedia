It is a standard problem in the theory of linear elasticity, specifically concerning antiplane shear deformation. We shall proceed with its solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the governing partial differential equation. In antiplane shear, the displacement field is given by $u_x = 0$, $u_y = 0$, and $u_z = w(x,y)$. In plane polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, this corresponds to $u_r = 0$, $u_\\theta = 0$, and the out-of-plane displacement is $w(r, \\theta)$. The only non-zero components of the infinitesimal strain tensor are related to the gradients of $w$. The engineering shear strains are $\\gamma_{xz} = \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}$ and $\\gamma_{yz} = \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}$. In polar coordinates, the non-zero shear strains are $\\gamma_{rz}$ and $\\gamma_{\\theta z}$, given by the kinematic relations:\n$$\n\\gamma_{rz} = \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial r}\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\theta z} = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\theta}\n$$\nFor a homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic material, the constitutive relations (Hooke's law) for antiplane shear relate the out-of-plane shear stresses to the corresponding strains via the shear modulus $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\tau_{rz} = \\mu \\gamma_{rz} = \\mu \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial r}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_{\\theta z} = \\mu \\gamma_{\\theta z} = \\mu \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\theta}\n$$\nAll other stress components are zero. In the absence of body forces, the quasi-static equilibrium equations in polar coordinates reduce to a single non-trivial equation for the balance of forces in the $z$-direction:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial(r\\tau_{rz})}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial \\tau_{\\theta z}}{\\partial \\theta} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the constitutive relations into the equilibrium equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r \\mu \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial r}\\right) + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}\\left(\\mu \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\theta}\\right) = 0\n$$\nSince the shear modulus $\\mu$ is a positive constant, we can factor it out and simplify the equation:\n$$\n\\mu \\left[ \\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial r} + r\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial r^2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial \\theta^2} \\right] = 0\n$$\nDividing by $\\mu$ and simplifying gives the governing PDE for $w(r, \\theta)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial \\theta^2} = 0\n$$\nThis is Laplace's equation for $w$ in polar coordinates, $\\nabla^2 w = 0$.\n\nNext, we formulate the boundary conditions. The wedge has two faces at $\\theta=0$ and $\\theta=\\alpha$.\nOn the face $\\theta=0$, the displacement is zero (clamped condition):\n$$\nw(r, 0) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } 0  r  R\n$$\nOn the face $\\theta=\\alpha$, the surface is traction-free. The traction vector $\\mathbf{t}$ on a surface with unit normal $\\mathbf{n}$ is $\\mathbf{t}=\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\mathbf{n}$. For the surface $\\theta=\\alpha$, the normal vector is $\\mathbf{n}=\\mathbf{e}_\\theta$. The traction vector components are $t_r = \\tau_{r\\theta}$, $t_\\theta = \\tau_{\\theta\\theta}$, and $t_z = \\tau_{\\theta z}$. In antiplane shear, $\\tau_{r\\theta}=0$ and $\\tau_{\\theta\\theta}=0$ identically. The traction-free condition thus reduces to $t_z = \\tau_{\\theta z} = 0$ on the boundary $\\theta=\\alpha$. Using the constitutive relation, this becomes:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\theta z}(r, \\alpha) = \\mu \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\theta}(r, \\alpha) = 0\n$$\nSince $\\mu  0$ and $r  0$, the condition simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\theta}(r, \\alpha) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } 0  r  R\n$$\nNow, we use the method of separation of variables with the ansatz $w(r, \\theta) = r^{\\lambda}\\Phi(\\theta)$. Substituting this into Laplace's equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial r^2}(r^{\\lambda}\\Phi(\\theta)) + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r^{\\lambda}\\Phi(\\theta)) + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\theta^2}(r^{\\lambda}\\Phi(\\theta)) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda(\\lambda-1)r^{\\lambda-2}\\Phi(\\theta) + \\frac{1}{r}\\lambda r^{\\lambda-1}\\Phi(\\theta) + \\frac{1}{r^2}r^{\\lambda}\\Phi''(\\theta) = 0\n$$\nMultiplying by $r^2$ and factoring out $r^\\lambda$:\n$$\nr^{\\lambda} [ \\lambda(\\lambda-1)\\Phi(\\theta) + \\lambda\\Phi(\\theta) + \\Phi''(\\theta) ] = 0\n$$\n$$\nr^{\\lambda} [ \\lambda^2\\Phi(\\theta) + \\Phi''(\\theta) ] = 0\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution, the term in the brackets must be zero, which gives the ordinary differential equation for the angular part $\\Phi(\\theta)$:\n$$\n\\Phi''(\\theta) + \\lambda^2 \\Phi(\\theta) = 0\n$$\nThe boundary conditions for $\\Phi(\\theta)$ are derived from the boundary conditions for $w(r, \\theta)$:\n1.  $w(r, 0) = r^{\\lambda}\\Phi(0) = 0 \\implies \\Phi(0) = 0$.\n2.  $\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\theta}(r, \\alpha) = r^{\\lambda}\\Phi'(\\alpha) = 0 \\implies \\Phi'(\\alpha) = 0$.\n\nWe solve this Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem. The general solution to the ODE depends on the sign of $\\lambda^2$.\nIf $\\lambda^2 = 0$, $\\Phi(\\theta) = A\\theta+B$. $\\Phi(0)=0 \\implies B=0$. $\\Phi'(\\alpha)=A=0$. This gives the trivial solution $\\Phi(\\theta)=0$.\nIf $\\lambda^2  0$, let $\\lambda^2 = -k^2$ for $k0$. $\\Phi(\\theta) = A\\cosh(k\\theta)+B\\sinh(k\\theta)$. $\\Phi(0)=0 \\implies A=0$. Then $\\Phi'(\\theta)=Bk\\cosh(k\\theta)$, so $\\Phi'(\\alpha)=Bk\\cosh(k\\alpha)=0$. Since $k0$ and $\\alpha0$, $\\cosh(k\\alpha) \\ge 1$, so we must have $B=0$, leading again to the trivial solution.\nIf $\\lambda^2  0$, we may assume $\\lambda0$. The general solution is $\\Phi(\\theta) = A\\cos(\\lambda\\theta) + B\\sin(\\lambda\\theta)$.\nThe condition $\\Phi(0)=0$ implies $A=0$. The solution is of the form $\\Phi(\\theta) = B\\sin(\\lambda\\theta)$.\nThe derivative is $\\Phi'(\\theta) = B\\lambda\\cos(\\lambda\\theta)$. Applying the second boundary condition:\n$$\n\\Phi'(\\alpha) = B\\lambda\\cos(\\lambda\\alpha) = 0\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution, we require $B\\neq0$. As we are looking for non-zero eigenvalues, $\\lambda \\neq 0$. Thus, we must have $\\cos(\\lambda\\alpha)=0$.\nThis condition is satisfied when $\\lambda\\alpha$ is an odd integer multiple of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$:\n$$\n\\lambda\\alpha = (2n+1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\quad n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}\n$$\nThe admissible eigenvalues, or the spectrum, are therefore:\n$$\n\\lambda_n = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{2\\alpha}, \\quad n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots\n$$\nThe associated eigenfunctions are $\\Phi_n(\\theta) = B_n \\sin(\\lambda_n \\theta)$, where $B_n$ are constants.\n\nA regularity condition must be imposed at the wedge tip $r=0$. A physically meaningful solution requires that the strain energy stored in any neighborhood of the origin be finite. The strain energy density scales as $|\\nabla w|^2 \\sim (r^{\\lambda-1})^2 = r^{2\\lambda-2}$. The strain energy is the integral of this density over the area element $r\\,dr\\,d\\theta$. The radial part of this integral behaves as $\\int_0^{\\epsilon} r^{2\\lambda-2} r \\, dr = \\int_0^{\\epsilon} r^{2\\lambda-1} dr$. This integral converges only if the exponent is greater than $-1$, i.e., $2\\lambda-1  -1$, which implies $2\\lambda  0$ or $\\lambda  0$. The eigenvalues $\\lambda_n$ we derived are all positive since $\\alpha \\in(0, \\pi)$ and $n \\ge 0$. Therefore, all solutions of the form $w_n(r, \\theta) = B_n r^{\\lambda_n}\\sin(\\lambda_n\\theta)$ are physically admissible. The regularity condition excludes solutions with negative powers of $r$ that would arise if we chose negative roots for $\\lambda$.\n\nFinally, we consider the specific case where the wedge opening angle is $\\alpha=\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$. We substitute this into the formula for the eigenvalues:\n$$\n\\lambda_n = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{2(\\frac{2\\pi}{3})} = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{\\frac{4\\pi}{3}} = \\frac{3}{4}(2n+1)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the $3$rd positive eigenvalue, counted in ascending order starting from $n=0$.\nThe first eigenvalue (for $n=0$) is $\\lambda_0 = \\frac{3}{4}(2(0)+1) = \\frac{3}{4}$.\nThe second eigenvalue (for $n=1$) is $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{3}{4}(2(1)+1) = \\frac{3}{4}(3) = \\frac{9}{4}$.\nThe third eigenvalue (for $n=2$) is $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{3}{4}(2(2)+1) = \\frac{3}{4}(5) = \\frac{15}{4}$.\nThis is the required value.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{15}{4}}$$", "id": "2615413"}, {"introduction": "The theory of antiplane shear finds its most significant application in the field of fracture mechanics, specifically in modeling Mode III cracks.
