It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard scenario for comparing plane stress and plane strain conditions, which are special cases of generalized plane strain. All necessary information is provided, the assumptions are clearly stated, and the objectives are unambiguous. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles of physics or mathematics. It is free from factual errors, non-formalizable concepts, and internal contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe analysis begins with the three-dimensional constitutive law for a linear isotropic elastic material (Hooke's Law), relating the strain tensor $\\epsilon_{ij}$ to the stress tensor $\\sigma_{ij}$. For the normal components, these relations are:\n$$ \\epsilon_{xx} = \\frac{1}{E} [ \\sigma_{xx} - \\nu (\\sigma_{yy} + \\sigma_{zz}) ] $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{yy} = \\frac{1}{E} [ \\sigma_{yy} - \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{zz}) ] $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{zz} = \\frac{1}{E} [ \\sigma_{zz} - \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}) ] $$\nThe shear stress components $\\sigma_{xy}$, $\\sigma_{yz}$, and $\\sigma_{xz}$ are zero due to the uniform normal tractions on the lateral faces, which implies that the corresponding shear strains $\\epsilon_{xy}$, $\\epsilon_{yz}$, and $\\epsilon_{xz}$ are also zero.\n\nThe assumption of generalized plane strain dictates that all field quantities are independent of the axial coordinate $z$. This implies that the strain components are, at most, functions of $x$ and $y$. Crucially, the axial strain $\\epsilon_{zz}$ must be uniform over any cross-section, i.e., $\\epsilon_{zz} = C$, where $C$ is a constant.\n\nThe problem states that the in-plane stresses $\\sigma_{xx} = S_x$ and $\\sigma_{yy} = S_y$ are spatially uniform. We can rearrange the constitutive relation for $\\epsilon_{zz}$ to express $\\sigma_{zz}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{zz} = E \\epsilon_{zz} + \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}) $$\nSubstituting the given uniform stresses and the constant axial strain, we find:\n$$ \\sigma_{zz} = E C + \\nu (S_x + S_y) $$\nSince $E$, $C$, $\\nu$, $S_x$, and $S_y$ are all constants, it follows that the axial stress $\\sigma_{zz}$ must also be a constant, uniform over the entire cross-section. Let us denote this uniform axial stress by $\\sigma_{zz}(x,y) = \\Sigma_{z}$.\n\nWith this framework, we analyze the two specified end conditions.\n\n**Case F: Free Ends**\nThe condition of \"free ends\" means that the resultant axial force, $N_z$, acting on any cross-section must be zero. The resultant force is obtained by integrating the axial stress $\\sigma_{zz}$ over the cross-sectional area $A = b h$.\n$$ N_z = \\int_A \\sigma_{zz} \\, dA = 0 $$\nSince we have established that $\\sigma_{zz} = \\Sigma_z$ is uniform, the integral becomes:\n$$ \\Sigma_z \\int_A dA = \\Sigma_z A = 0 $$\nAs the cross-sectional area $A$ is non-zero, this condition requires that the axial stress itself must be zero.\n$$ \\sigma_{zz}^{\\mathrm{F}} = 0 $$\nThis state, where $\\sigma_{zz}=0$, is precisely the definition of **plane stress**.\n\nWith the axial stress determined, we can now find the corresponding axial strain $\\epsilon_{zz}^{\\mathrm{F}}$ from the constitutive law:\n$$ \\epsilon_{zz}^{\\mathrm{F}} = \\frac{1}{E} [ \\sigma_{zz}^{\\mathrm{F}} - \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}) ] $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{zz}^{\\mathrm{F}} = \\frac{1}{E} [ 0 - \\nu (S_x + S_y) ] $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{zz}^{\\mathrm{F}} = -\\frac{\\nu}{E} (S_x + S_y) $$\n\n**Case K: Kinematically Fixed Ends**\nThe condition of \"kinematically fixed ends\" implies that the axial displacement $u_z$ is zero at both ends of the prism, $z=0$ and $z=L$. In the context of generalized plane strain, the axial displacement field is $u_z(z) = \\epsilon_{zz} z + \\text{constant}$. For $u_z$ to be zero at both $z=0$ and $z=L$ (assuming the rigid body displacement is zero), the axial strain $\\epsilon_{zz}$ must be zero.\n$$ \\epsilon_{zz}^{\\mathrm{K}} = 0 $$\nThis state, where $\\epsilon_{zz}=0$, is the definition of **plane strain**.\n\nWith the axial strain determined, we find the corresponding axial stress $\\sigma_{zz}^{\\mathrm{K}}$ required to enforce this constraint. From the rearranged constitutive relation:\n$$ \\sigma_{zz}^{\\mathrm{K}} = E \\epsilon_{zz}^{\\mathrm{K}} + \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{zz}^{\\mathrm{K}} = E(0) + \\nu(S_x + S_y) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{zz}^{\\mathrm{K}} = \\nu (S_x + S_y) $$\nThis non-zero stress is the uniform reaction stress developed within the material due to the prevention of Poisson's effect-induced contraction or expansion.\n\n**Summary of Results**\nThe requested quantities are:\n- For Case F (free ends, plane stress):\n  - $\\epsilon_{zz}^{\\mathrm{F}} = -\\frac{\\nu(S_x + S_y)}{E}$\n  - $\\sigma_{zz}^{\\mathrm{F}} = 0$\n- For Case K (fixed ends, plane strain):\n  - $\\epsilon_{zz}^{\\mathrm{K}} = 0$\n  - $\\sigma_{zz}^{\\mathrm{K}} = \\nu(S_x + S_y)$\n\nThe final answer is to be presented as a single row vector containing these four results in the specified order.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{\\nu (S_x + S_y)}{E} & 0 & 0 & \\nu (S_x + S_y) \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2643879"}, {"introduction": "Building on the distinction between different two-dimensional models, this practice introduces a more formal method for comparing them.

It is well-posed, providing sufficient definitions, boundary conditions, and governing equations to determine a unique solution for the specified fields. The language is objective and precise, with one minor exception: the statement for GPS that \"all fields are independent of $z$\". A non-zero constant axial strain $\\epsilon_{zz}$ implies a displacement field $u_z$ that is linear in $z$, and thus not strictly independent of $z$. However, in the context of generalized plane strain, this language is a common, if slightly imprecise, convention meaning that stresses and strains are independent of $z$. This does not constitute a flaw that invalidates the problem, as the intent is unambiguous within the discipline. The problem is a standard exercise in continuum mechanics and is free of scientific unsoundness, contradiction, or infeasibility.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem concerns a uniform uniaxial tensile state. We seek a constant stress tensor field $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ that satisfies the equilibrium equations $\\sigma_{ij,j}=0$ trivially and the boundary conditions.\nThe prescribed tractions on the $x$-faces imply $\\sigma_{xx} = T$. The traction-free conditions on the $y$-faces ($\\boldsymbol{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\boldsymbol{n} = \\boldsymbol{0}$ on $y=0, L_y$) imply $\\sigma_{yy}=0$ and $\\sigma_{yx}=0$. The zero shear tractions on all faces imply all shear components of stress are zero.\nThus, the stress tensor has the form $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathrm{diag}(\\sigma_{xx}, \\sigma_{yy}, \\sigma_{zz}) = \\mathrm{diag}(T, 0, \\sigma_{zz})$, where $\\sigma_{zz}$ is a constant yet to be determined based on the modeling assumption.\n\nThe constitutive relations, given a diagonal stress tensor, are:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{xx} = \\frac{1}{E} [ \\sigma_{xx} - \\nu (\\sigma_{yy} + \\sigma_{zz}) ] = \\frac{1}{E}[T - \\nu \\sigma_{zz}]\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_{yy} = \\frac{1}{E} [ \\sigma_{yy} - \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{zz}) ] = \\frac{1}{E}[-\\nu (T + \\sigma_{zz})]\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_{zz} = \\frac{1}{E} [ \\sigma_{zz} - \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}) ] = \\frac{1}{E}[\\sigma_{zz} - \\nu T]\n$$\nAll shear strains $\\epsilon_{ij}$ for $i \\neq j$ are zero.\n\n**Part 1: Determination of Fields**\n\n**Plane Strain (PS) Model**\nThe plane strain assumption imposes the kinematic constraint $\\epsilon_{zz}^{(\\mathrm{PS})} = 0$. Using the constitutive relation for $\\epsilon_{zz}$:\n$0 = \\frac{1}{E}[\\sigma_{zz}^{(\\mathrm{PS})} - \\nu T] \\implies \\sigma_{zz}^{(\\mathrm{PS})} = \\nu T$.\n\nThe constant stress and strain fields for the PS model are therefore:\nStress:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{(\\mathrm{PS})} = \\begin{pmatrix} T & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\nu T \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nStrain:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{xx}^{(\\mathrm{PS})} = \\frac{1}{E}[T - \\nu (\\nu T)] = \\frac{T}{E}(1-\\nu^2)\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_{yy}^{(\\mathrm{PS})} = \\frac{1}{E}[-\\nu (T + \\nu T)] = -\\frac{\\nu T}{E}(1+\\nu)\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_{zz}^{(\\mathrm{PS})} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^{(\\mathrm{PS})} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{T}{E}(1-\\nu^2) & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\frac{\\nu T}{E}(1+\\nu) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe displacement field is found by integrating the strains, $\\epsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}(u_{i,j}+u_{j,i})$, and setting the arbitrary rigid body motion to zero:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{u}^{(\\mathrm{PS})}(x,y,z) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_{xx}^{(\\mathrm{PS})} x \\\\ \\epsilon_{yy}^{(\\mathrm{PS})} y \\\\ \\epsilon_{zz}^{(\\mathrm{PS})} z \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{T}{E}(1-\\nu^2) x \\\\ -\\frac{\\nu T}{E}(1+\\nu) y \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**Generalized Plane Strain (GPS) Model**\nThe GPS assumption imposes the static condition of zero net axial force on the cross-section normal to the $z$-axis: $\\int_{A} \\sigma_{zz}^{(\\mathrm{GPS})} \\, \\mathrm{d}A = 0$. Since we seek a uniform stress state, $\\sigma_{zz}^{(\\mathrm{GPS})}$ must be constant, so the condition simplifies to $\\sigma_{zz}^{(\\mathrm{GPS})} = 0$.

Under GPS with zero axial resultant, as $\\nu \\to 0.5$, the field $\\sigma_{zz}(x,y)$ behaves like a pressure-type (Lagrange multiplier) stress that enforces the incompressibility constraint in an average sense over $S$, namely $\\int_S (\\epsilon_{xx}+\\epsilon_{yy}+\\epsilon_{zz})\\,\\mathrm{d}A=0$.\n\nB. If $(\\epsilon_{xx}+\\epsilon_{yy})(x,y)$ is spatially nonuniform over $S$, then as $\\nu \\to 0.5$ the field $\\sigma_{zz}(x,y)$ must become spatially uniform to avoid locking.\n\nC. Displacement-based GPS finite elements with a single constant $\\epsilon_{zz}$ degree of freedom over the cross-section can exhibit volumetric locking as $\\nu \\to 0.5$ because they cannot represent the spatial variation of the pressure-like $\\sigma_{zz}(x,y)$ needed to enforce incompressibility locally.\n\nD.

The component for the axial stress, $\\sigma_{zz}$, is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{zz} = 2\\mu\\epsilon_{zz} + \\lambda(\\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy} + \\epsilon_{zz})\n$$\nUsing the GPS kinematic assumption that $\\epsilon_{zz} = e_0$ (a constant), this becomes:\n$$\n\\sigma_{zz}(x,y) = 2\\mu e_0 + \\lambda(\\epsilon_{xx}(x,y) + \\epsilon_{yy}(x,y) + e_0)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{zz}(x,y) = (2\\mu + \\lambda)e_0 + \\lambda(\\epsilon_{xx}(x,y) + \\epsilon_{yy}(x,y))\n$$\nThis is the expression for $\\sigma_{zz}$ in terms of the specified variables.\n\nThe constant $e_0$ is determined by the condition of zero resultant axial force:\n$$\n\\int_S \\sigma_{zz}\\,\\mathrm{d}A = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $\\sigma_{zz}$:\n$$\n\\int_S \\left[ (2\\mu + \\lambda)e_0 + \\lambda(\\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy}) \\right] \\mathrm{d}A = 0\n$$\nSince $e_0$, $\\mu$, and $\\lambda$ are constants over the cross-section $S$, we can write:\n$$\n(2\\mu + \\lambda)e_0 \\int_S \\mathrm{d}A + \\lambda \\int_S (\\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy})\\,\\mathrm{d}A = 0\n$$\nLet $A = \\int_S \\mathrm{d}A$ be the area of the cross-section. Then solving for $e_0$ yields:\n$$\ne_0 = -\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\mu+\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{1}{A} \\int_S (\\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy})\\,\\mathrm{d}A \\right)\n$$\nThis is the condition that determines $e_0$.\n\n**(ii) Elimination of $e_0$ to find $\\sigma_{zz}$**\n\nUsing the definition of the cross-sectional average $\\langle f \\rangle = \\frac{1}{A}\\int_S f\\,\\mathrm{d}A$, the expression for $e_0$ is:\n$$\ne_0 = -\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\mu+\\lambda} \\langle \\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy} \\rangle\n$$\nNow, we substitute this back into the expression for $\\sigma_{zz}(x,y)$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{zz}(x,y) = (2\\mu + \\lambda)\\left( -\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\mu+\\lambda} \\langle \\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy} \\rangle \\right) + \\lambda(\\epsilon_{xx}(x,y) + \\epsilon_{yy}(x,y))\n$$\nSimplifying this expression gives:\n$$\n\\sigma_{zz}(x,y) = -\\lambda \\langle \\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy} \\rangle + \\lambda(\\epsilon_{xx}(x,y) + \\epsilon_{yy}(x,y))\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{zz}(x,y) = \\lambda \\left[ (\\epsilon_{xx}(x,y) + \\epsilon_{yy}(x,y)) - \\langle \\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy} \\rangle \\right]\n$$\nThis result shows that the axial stress $\\sigma_{zz}$ is proportional to the deviation of the local in-plane volumetric strain from its cross-sectional average.\n\n**(iii) Asymptotic behavior as $\\nu \\to 0.5$**\n\nAs the Poisson's ratio $\\nu$ approaches the incompressible limit of $0.5$, the Lamé parameter $\\lambda$ diverges:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{E\\nu}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} \\to \\infty \\quad \\text{as} \\quad \\nu \\to 0.5^{-}\n$$\nThe shear modulus $\\mu = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}$ remains finite, approaching $\\mu \\to E/3$.\nThe expression for $\\sigma_{zz}$ is $\\sigma_{zz} = \\lambda \\left[ (\\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy}) - \\langle \\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy} \\rangle \\right]$. If the in-plane volumetric strain, $\\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy}$, is not spatially uniform, the term in the brackets is a non-zero function of $x$ and $y$. Consequently, as $\\lambda \\to \\infty$, the stress field $\\sigma_{zz}(x,y)$ must also diverge, unless $(\\epsilon_{xx}+\\epsilon_{yy})$ is constant. This large, developing stress acts to enforce a kinematic constraint.\n\nLet us examine this constraint. The total volumetric strain is $\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}) = \\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy} + \\epsilon_{zz} = \\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy} + e_0$. For an incompressible material, we expect $\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}) = 0$. Let us see what the GPS formulation enforces.\nAs $\\nu \\to 0.5$, the prefactor in the expression for $e_0$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\mu+\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{2\\mu/\\lambda + 1} \\to 1 \\quad \\text{since} \\quad \\lambda \\to \\infty\n$$\nTherefore, in the limit, $e_0 \\to -\\langle \\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy} \\rangle$.\nThe total volumetric strain becomes:\n$$\n\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}) \\to (\\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy}) - \\langle \\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy} \\rangle\n$$\nThe incompressibility constraint $\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon})=0$ is thus not enforced pointwise. Instead, let us integrate the volumetric strain over the cross-section:\n$$\n\\int_S \\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon})\\,\\mathrm{d}A = \\int_S \\left[ (\\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy}) - \\langle \\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy} \\rangle \\right] \\mathrm{d}A = \\int_S (\\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy})\\,\\mathrm{d}A - \\langle \\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy} \\rangle \\int_S \\mathrm{d}A\n$$\n$$\n= A \\langle \\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy} \\rangle - A \\langle \\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy} \\rangle = 0\n$$\nThe GPS formulation with zero axial force enforces the incompressibility constraint only in an average or weak sense over the cross-section, i.e., $\\int_S \\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon})\\,\\mathrm{d}A = 0$. The axial stress $\\sigma_{zz}$ can be interpreted as a pressure-like field, or a Lagrange multiplier, that enforces this average constraint. For the stress to remain bounded, the pointwise in-plane volumetric strain must be constant, $(\\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy}) = \\text{const}$.\n\n**(iv) Implications for FEM**\n\nIn a standard displacement-based Finite Element Method, the displacement field $\\boldsymbol{u}(x,y)$ is interpolated from nodal values. The strains are obtained by differentiating the interpolated displacements. For a GPS formulation, an additional global degree of freedom for $e_0$ is used.\nThe strain energy density includes the volumetric term $\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda(\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}))^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda(\\epsilon_{xx}+\\epsilon_{yy}+e_0)^2$. As $\\nu \\to 0.5$, $\\lambda \\to \\infty$, and this term acts as a penalty to enforce the constraint $\\epsilon_{xx}(x,y)+\\epsilon_{yy}(x,y)+e_0 \\approx 0$ pointwise. This implies that the in-plane volumetric strain $\\epsilon_{xx}+\\epsilon_{yy}$ must be nearly constant across each element.\n\nHowever, the chosen element shape functions may not be able to represent a state where $\\epsilon_{xx}+\\epsilon_{yy}$ is constant while also representing a physically correct deformation mode (e.g., bending, where strains vary linearly). This imposition of an overly severe kinematic constraint on the discrete displacement field leads to an artificially stiff response, where the element \"locks\" and produces results that are orders of magnitude too small. This is volumetric locking. The formulation cannot develop the required spatially varying stress field (related to $\\sigma_{zz}$ and the hydrostatic pressure $p$) that must accompany non-uniform deformation in an incompressible material.\n\nMixed formulations mitigate locking by introducing the hydrostatic pressure $p$ as an independent field, interpolated separately. The incompressibility constraint is then enforced in a weak (integral) sense by making the variational functional stationary with respect to $p$. This decouples the pressure field from the displacement derivatives, allowing the element sufficient flexibility to represent both the deformation and the associated pressure response. Selective/reduced integration schemes achieve a similar effect by under-integrating the volumetric part of the stiffness matrix, which is often equivalent to a specific mixed formulation and also relaxes the pointwise incompressibility constraint.\n\n---\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Under GPS with zero axial resultant, as $\\nu \\to 0.5$, the field $\\sigma_{zz}(x,y)$ behaves like a pressure-type (Lagrange multiplier) stress that enforces the incompressibility constraint in an average sense over $S$, namely $\\int_S (\\epsilon_{xx}+\\epsilon_{yy}+\\epsilon_{zz})\\,\\mathrm{d}A=0$.**\nAs derived in (iii), $\\sigma_{zz}$ scales with $\\lambda \\to \\infty$ and is proportional to the deviation of local volumetric strain from the mean. This is the behavior of a Lagrange multiplier. We also proved that the formulation leads to $\\int_S \\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}) \\mathrm{d}A = \\int_S (\\epsilon_{xx}+\\epsilon_{yy}+\\epsilon_{zz})\\,\\mathrm{d}A \\to 0$. The statement is an accurate summary of the analysis.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. If $(\\epsilon_{xx}+\\epsilon_{yy})(x,y)$ is spatially nonuniform over $S$, then as $\\nu \\to 0.5$ the field $\\sigma_{zz}(x,y)$ must become spatially uniform to avoid locking.**\nFrom (ii), $\\sigma_{zz}(x,y) = \\lambda [ (\\epsilon_{xx}(x,y) + \\epsilon_{yy}(x,y)) - \\langle \\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy} \\rangle ]$. If $(\\epsilon_{xx}+\\epsilon_{yy})$ is nonuniform, its deviation from the mean is also nonuniform. Therefore, $\\sigma_{zz}(x,y)$ must be nonuniform. Locking occurs precisely because a simple displacement-based FEM cannot adequately represent this required nonuniform pressure-like stress. The statement makes a contrary and incorrect assertion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Displacement-based GPS finite elements with a single constant $\\epsilon_{zz}$ degree of freedom over the cross-section can exhibit volumetric locking as $\\nu \\to 0.5$ because they cannot represent the spatial variation of the pressure-like $\\sigma_{zz}(x,y)$ needed to enforce incompressibility locally.**\nThis statement correctly identifies the mechanism of locking as discussed in (iv). The pure displacement formulation ties all stress components, including the pressure-like $\\sigma_{zz}$, directly to derivatives of the interpolated displacements. This lacks the degrees of freedom needed to represent the spatially varying hydrostatic stress that must arise in an incompressible body under non-uniform strain. The constraint of a single $e_0$ combined with the $\\lambda \\to \\infty$ penalty over-constrains the element kinematics.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. In the incompressible limit, GPS becomes equivalent to plane stress because $\\sigma_{zz}\\to 0$ pointwise for traction-free ends.**\nPlane stress requires $\\sigma_{zz} = 0$ pointwise. The condition given is $\\int_S \\sigma_{zz}\\,\\mathrm{d}A = 0$ (zero resultant). As shown in (iii), if the in-plane volumetric strain is nonuniform, $\\sigma_{zz}$ does not go to zero; it becomes a large, spatially varying field whose integral is zero. GPS is distinct from plane stress.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. A mixed displacement–pressure ($\\boldsymbol{u}$–$p$) formulation, or selective/reduced integration that effectively introduces an independent pressure field $p(x,y)$, alleviates locking by allowing the hydrostatic stress to be approximated independently of the displacement field and by enforcing incompressibility in a weak sense.**\nThis is the standard and correct explanation for how to overcome volumetric locking, as detailed in (iv). By introducing pressure as a separate field, the formulation decouples the volumetric and deviatoric responses, allowing for a stable and accurate solution in the nearly incompressible regime. Enforcing the constraint in a weak sense (via the stationarity of a variational principle) is the key.\n**Verdict: Correct**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "2643867"}]}
