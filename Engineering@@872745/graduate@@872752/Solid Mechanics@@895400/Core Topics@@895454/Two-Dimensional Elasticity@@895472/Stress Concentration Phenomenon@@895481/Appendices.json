It is a classical, well-posed problem in the linear theory of elasticity, specifically addressing the phenomenon of stress concentration around a circular hole in an infinite plate under a pure shear loading condition. All premises are scientifically grounded, the required information is self-contained and consistent, and the objectives are defined with sufficient rigor to permit a unique analytical solution.\n\nThe problem investigates the stress field around a traction-free circular hole of radius $a$ in an infinite plate subjected to a pure shear stress $\\tau_0$ at infinity.

The numerical task of finding a convergent modeling strategy is also well-posed, as it has a definite set of best practices and established theoretical underpinnings for convergence.\n-   **Objectivity:** The language is technical, precise, and free from subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a standard, well-posed problem in computational solid mechanics. I will proceed with the detailed analysis of each provided option.\n\nThe goal is to find a modeling strategy that is both necessary and sufficient for obtaining a converged estimate of the stress concentration factor $K_t$. For a finite stress concentration at a smooth boundary (a circular hole), accuracy is governed by several factors in an FEM model. Let us evaluate each option against the fundamental principles.\n\nThe analytical solution for an infinite plate ($W \\to \\infty$) is $K_t = 3$. For a finite-width plate, $K_t$ is a function of the ratio $a/W$ and is less than $3$. An accurate FEM model must correctly capture the physics and have sufficient discretization to resolve the high stress gradients near the hole.\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\n-   **Symmetry and Domain:** The strategy correctly proposes to model a quadrant of the plate, exploiting the biaxial symmetry of both geometry and loading. This is the most efficient approach, reducing computational cost by a factor of $4$. The symmetry boundary conditions, $u_x=0$ on the symmetry plane at $x=0$ and $u_y=0$ on the symmetry plane at $y=0$, are correctly stated.\n-   **Domain Extent:** The conditions $W/a \\ge 6$ and $H/a \\ge 6$ adhere to Saint-Venant's principle. They ensure the outer boundaries are sufficiently remote from the hole, so the application of boundary conditions does not artificially contaminate the stress field near the region of interest. This allows the model to correctly simulate a \"remote\" uniaxial stress state.\n-   **Boundary Conditions:** Applying a uniform traction $\\sigma_{xx}=\\sigma_0$ on the edge $x=+W$ is the most direct and physically accurate representation of the prescribed remote loading. Setting the top edge $y=+H$ as traction-free ($\\sigma_{yy}=0$, $\\sigma_{xy}=0$) is also correct for a uniaxial tension problem. The traction-free condition on the hole boundary ($r=a$) is essential.\n-   **Element Type:** The use of quadratic isoparametric $8$-node quadrilateral elements is an excellent choice. Quadratic elements have a much higher rate of convergence for stresses compared to linear elements, especially in problems involving stress gradients or bending-like deformation.\n-   **Mesh Design:** The strategy specifies a boundary-layer mesh, which is critical. The mesh is finest near the hole (first ring thickness $\\Delta r/a \\le 0.05$) where stress gradients are steepest, with a controlled radial grading factor ($\\le 1.2$) to transition to a coarser mesh in the far field. A sufficient number of elements around the hole's circumference ($n_\\theta \\ge 24$) is specified to capture the variation of $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}$. This is a professional meshing strategy.\n-   **Stress Evaluation:** Recovering boundary stresses by extrapolating from the interior Gauss points is the most accurate procedure in displacement-based FEM, as stresses are most accurate at these points.\n\nThis strategy is methodologically sound in every aspect. It is necessary and sufficient to achieve a converged solution. Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\n-   **Symmetry and Domain:** Modeling the full plate is inefficient. The chosen domain size, $W/a=H/a=2$, is far too small. The boundaries are too close to the hole, leading to significant interaction between the boundary conditions and the stress concentration, yielding an incorrect value for $K_t$ that does not represent a \"remote\" load condition.\n-   **Boundary Conditions:** Applying a uniform displacement is a valid alternative to uniform traction, but the constraint $u_y=0$ on the top and bottom edges is a fatal flaw. This prevents the lateral contraction predicted by the Poisson effect under uniaxial tension, thereby incorrectly modeling a state closer to generalized plane strain in the y-direction, not uniaxial stress.\n-   **Element and Mesh:** The use of linear $3$-node elements on a uniform coarse mesh with element size $h \\approx a$ is completely inadequate. This combination cannot resolve the steep stress gradient near the hole. The error in the stress prediction will be unacceptably large.\n-   **Stress Evaluation:** Reading stress directly from nodal values is less accurate than extrapolation from Gauss points, particularly with a poor mesh and low-order elements.\n\nThis strategy is fundamentally flawed in its choice of domain size, boundary conditions, element type, and meshing. It would produce a grossly inaccurate result. Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\n-   **Physical Model:** The prescription to use plane strain is incorrect. The problem states the plate is thin ($t/a \\ll 1$), for which plane stress is the appropriate two-dimensional simplification. Plane strain is for thick plates.\n-   **Element Type:** The use of crack-tip quarter-point singular elements is a fundamental conceptual error. These elements are designed to model the $1/\\sqrt{r}$ stress singularity at the tip of a sharp crack. A circular hole is a geometric discontinuity that causes a finite stress concentration, not a singularity. Using these elements is inappropriate and will lead to an incorrect representation of the stress field.\n-   **Boundary Conditions:** Applying the total force as nodal loads is a poor approximation of uniform traction, as it introduces artificial non-physical stress concentrations at the load points. Furthermore, leaving \"other external edges traction-free\" is ambiguous and likely incorrect, as the symmetry planes in a quadrant model require displacement constraints, not zero traction.\n\nThis strategy is foundationally wrong due to incorrect physics, incorrect element selection, and poor boundary condition application. Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n-   **Symmetry and Domain:** Modeling the top half is acceptable but less efficient than a quadrant model. The domain size $W/a=H/a=8$ is adequate.\n-   **Element Type:** Using reduced-integration linear $4$-node elements is a poor choice. While reduced integration can mitigate locking, linear elements are inherently inferior to quadratic elements for capturing stress gradients. They would require a much finer mesh to achieve comparable accuracy.\n-   **Mesh Design:** The proposed mesh design is catastrophically wrong. It suggests refining the far field while using a coarse mesh at the hole ($n_\\theta=4$ elements for the full circumference). The high stress gradient is at the hole, so this is precisely where the mesh must be finest. Refining the far field, where the stress is nearly uniform, is wasteful and useless for improving the accuracy of $K_t$.\n-   **Boundary Conditions:** The use of periodic boundary conditions between $y=0$ and $y=+H$ is nonsensical for this problem. Periodic BCs are for modeling structures with repeating geometry and loading, which is not the case here.\n\nThis strategy demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of meshing principles for stress concentration problems and a misapplication of boundary conditions. Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOnly option A describes a complete and correct methodology that adheres to all established best practices of the Finite Element Method for this class of problem. It correctly specifies the physical model, domain, boundary conditions, element type, meshing strategy, and stress evaluation procedure required to obtain a converged and accurate result for the stress concentration factor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2690247"}]}
