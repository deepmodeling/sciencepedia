It presents a classical problem in the linear theory of elasticity, specifically concerning contact mechanics on an elastic half-space. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. We shall proceed with a rigorous derivation from first principles as directed.\n\nThe foundation of this analysis is the Boussinesq problem, which provides the solution for the stress and displacement fields in an isotropic, homogeneous, linear elastic half-space subjected to a concentrated normal point load on its surface. Let the half-space occupy the region $z \\ge 0$. A point load of magnitude $P_0$ is applied at the origin $(0,0,0)$ in the negative $z$-direction. The vertical displacement, $w(r)$, on the surface $z=0$ at a radial distance $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ from the point of application is given by the fundamental solution:\n$$\nw(r) = \\frac{P_0 (1 - \\nu^2)}{\\pi E r}\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the Young's modulus and $\\nu$ is the Poisson's ratio of the elastic material. This expression serves as the Green's function for the vertical surface displacement due to a normal point load.\n\nThe problem describes a uniform normal pressure $p$ distributed over a circular patch of radius $a$, centered at the origin. The principle of linear superposition, which is valid for linear elastic systems, allows us to determine the total displacement at any point by integrating the effects of infinitesimal point loads over the entire loaded area.\n\nConsider an infinitesimal area element $dA'$ located at a point $(\\xi, \\eta)$ within the circular patch $D = \\{(\\xi, \\eta) : \\xi^2 + \\eta^2 \\le a^2\\}$. This area element is subjected to an infinitesimal normal force $dP = p \\, dA'$. This force can be treated as a concentrated point load.\n\nWe are required to find the vertical displacement $w(0)$ at the center of the patch, i.e., at the point $(x=0, y=0)$. The distance from the source point $(\\xi, \\eta)$ to the field point $(0,0)$ is $r' = \\sqrt{\\xi^2 + \\eta^2}$. The contribution $dw(0)$ to the vertical displacement at the center from the infinitesimal load $dP$ at $(\\xi, \\eta)$ is obtained by applying the Boussinesq formula:\n$$\ndw(0) = \\frac{dP (1 - \\nu^2)}{\\pi E r'} = \\frac{p \\, dA' (1 - \\nu^2)}{\\pi E r'}\n$$\nTo find the total vertical displacement $w(0)$, we must integrate this expression over the entire circular domain $D$:\n$$\nw(0) = \\iint_D \\frac{p (1 - \\nu^2)}{\\pi E r'} \\, dA'\n$$\nThe integration is most conveniently performed using polar coordinates. Let the source point be described by $(\\rho', \\phi')$, where $\\xi = \\rho' \\cos \\phi'$ and $\\eta = \\rho' \\sin \\phi'$. In this coordinate system, the distance to the origin is $r' = \\rho'$, and the infinitesimal area element is $dA' = \\rho' \\, d\\rho' \\, d\\phi'$. The integration limits are $0 \\le \\rho' \\le a$ and $0 \\le \\phi' \\le 2\\pi$.\n\nSubstituting these into the integral for $w(0)$, we have:\n$$\nw(0) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{a} \\frac{p (1 - \\nu^2)}{\\pi E \\rho'} (\\rho' \\, d\\rho' \\, d\\phi')\n$$\nA critical simplification occurs as the term $\\rho'$ from the area element cancels the term $\\rho'$ in the denominator of the Green's function. The integrand becomes constant with respect to the integration variables:\n$$\nw(0) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{a} \\frac{p (1 - \\nu^2)}{\\pi E} \\, d\\rho' \\, d\\phi'\n$$\nWe can separate the integrals and evaluate them directly:\n$$\nw(0) = \\frac{p (1 - \\nu^2)}{\\pi E} \\left( \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\phi' \\right) \\left( \\int_{0}^{a} d\\rho' \\right)\n$$\nThe evaluation of these elementary integrals yields:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\phi' = 2\\pi, \\quad \\int_{0}^{a} d\\rho' = a\n$$\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $w(0)$:\n$$\nw(0) = \\frac{p (1 - \\nu^2)}{\\pi E} (2\\pi)(a) = \\frac{2pa(1 - \\nu^2)}{E}\n$$\nThis is the vertical displacement at the center of the loaded circular patch.\n\nThe problem defines the compliance $C(a)$ as the ratio of this central displacement to the total resultant load $P$. The total load $P$ is the uniform pressure $p$ integrated over the area of the circle, $\\pi a^2$:\n$$\nP = p (\\pi a^2)\n$$\nFrom this, we express the pressure $p$ in terms of the total load $P$:\n$$\np = \\frac{P}{\\pi a^2}\n$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $p$ into the formula for $w(0)$:\n$$\nw(0) = \\frac{2 \\left( \\frac{P}{\\pi a^2} \\right) a (1 - \\nu^2)}{E} = \\frac{2P(1 - \\nu^2)}{\\pi a E}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the compliance $C(a)$ according to its definition:\n$$\nC(a) \\equiv \\frac{w(0)}{P} = \\frac{1}{P} \\left( \\frac{2P(1 - \\nu^2)}{\\pi a E} \\right)\n$$\nThe total load $P$ cancels out, yielding the final expression for the normal surface compliance:\n$$\nC(a) = \\frac{2(1 - \\nu^2)}{\\pi a E}\n$$\nThis result is a function of the material properties $E$ and $\\nu$, and the radius of the loaded patch $a$, as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2(1 - \\nu^{2})}{\\pi a E}}\n$$", "id": "2620650"}, {"introduction": "While superposition is intuitive, Fourier analysis offers a powerful framework for solving elasticity problems, especially for arbitrary load distributions.

It is valid and can be solved as follows. The steps below correspond to the tasks outlined in the problem.\n\nFirst, we define the material parameters and constants that will be used. The elastic half-space is characterized by Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$. The Lamé parameters are related by $\\mu = E / (2(1+\\nu))$ and $\\lambda = E\\nu / ((1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu))$. The contact modulus, or plane strain modulus, is defined as $E^\\star = E / (1-\\nu^2)$.\n\n### 1. Derivation of the Spectral Relation\n\nWe begin with the Navier equations for static equilibrium in the absence of body forces:\n$$ \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} + (\\lambda + \\mu) \\nabla (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) = \\mathbf{0} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}, z)$ is the displacement field. We apply a two-dimensional Fourier transform in the spatial coordinates $(x,y)$. The transform of a function $f(x,y)$ is denoted by $\\hat{f}(k_x, k_y)$:\n$$ \\hat{f}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^2} f(\\mathbf{x}) e^{-i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}} d^2\\mathbf{x} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{x}=(x,y)$ and $\\mathbf{k}=(k_x, k_y)$. The operators transform as $\\nabla \\to (i k_x, i k_y, \\partial_z)$ and $\\nabla^2 \\to (-k^2 + \\partial_z^2)$, where $k = \\sqrt{k_x^2+k_y^2}$ is the wavenumber magnitude. This transforms the PDE system into a system of ordinary differential equations in $z$ for the transformed displacement components $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}(\\mathbf{k}, z)$.\n\nThe general solution to these ODEs that decays as $z \\to \\infty$ can be expressed in the form:\n$$ \\hat{u}_j(\\mathbf{k}, z) = (A_j + z B_j) e^{-kz} $$\nSubstituting this into the transformed Navier equations yields algebraic constraints on the coefficients $A_j$ and $B_j$. A more convenient approach is to use known results from elasticity theory. The solution for the transformed displacements under normal loading is given by:\n$$ \\hat{u}_x(\\mathbf{k}, z) = C(\\mathbf{k}) (1-2\\nu - kz) e^{-kz} \\frac{ik_x}{k} $$\n$$ \\hat{u}_y(\\mathbf{k}, z) = C(\\mathbf{k}) (1-2\\nu - kz) e^{-kz} \\frac{ik_y}{k} $$\n$$ \\hat{u}_z(\\mathbf{k}, z) = C(\\mathbf{k}) (2(1-\\nu) + kz) e^{-kz} $$\nThe coefficient $C(\\mathbf{k})$ is determined by the boundary conditions at the surface $z=0$. The boundary conditions are zero tangential tractions ($\\sigma_{xz}=\\sigma_{yz}=0$) and a prescribed normal traction $\\sigma_{zz}(x,y,0) = t_z(x,y)$. The relevant stress component is $\\sigma_{zz}$, which in terms of displacements is given by Hooke's law:\n$$ \\sigma_{zz} = \\lambda(\\partial_x u_x + \\partial_y u_y + \\partial_z u_z) + 2\\mu \\partial_z u_z $$\nApplying the Fourier transform gives:\n$$ \\hat{\\sigma}_{zz}(\\mathbf{k},z) = \\lambda(ik_x \\hat{u}_x + ik_y \\hat{u}_y + \\partial_z \\hat{u}_z) + 2\\mu \\partial_z \\hat{u}_z $$\nWe evaluate this at $z=0$ using the expressions for $\\hat{u}_j$. Assuming a standard loading convention where pressure $p$ acts downwards (in the $-z$ direction) causing a downward displacement $w$ (positive value represents downward motion), the boundary condition is $\\sigma_{zz} = -p$. The relation becomes:\n$$ \\hat{w}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{1-\\nu}{\\mu} \\frac{\\hat{p}(\\mathbf{k})}{k} $$\nUsing $\\mu = E/(2(1+\\nu))$ and $E^\\star = E/(1-\\nu^2)$:\n$$ \\frac{1-\\nu}{\\mu} = \\frac{(1-\\nu) \\cdot 2(1+\\nu)}{E} = \\frac{2(1-\\nu^2)}{E} = \\frac{2}{E/(1-\\nu^2)} = \\frac{2}{E^\\star} $$\nThe final spectral relation is:\n$$ \\hat{w}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{2}{E^\\star k} \\hat{p}(\\mathbf{k}) $$\nThis relation represents a linear filter in the frequency domain. The displacement response to a given traction component at wavenumber $k$ is proportional to the traction at that same wavenumber. The factor of proportionality, $\\hat{G}(k) = 2/(E^\\star k)$, is the spectral compliance or Green's function. The appearance of $1/k$ signifies that the problem is governed by an elliptic partial differential equation, whose Green's function is non-local. In the spatial domain, this corresponds to long-range interactions. The compliance is large for small $k$ (long wavelengths), indicating the half-space is compliant to large-scale loads, and small for large $k$ (short wavelengths), indicating stiffness against highly localized loads.\n\n### 2. Spatial Domain Convolution Law\n\nThe relationship $\\hat{w}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\hat{G}(\\mathbf{k}) \\hat{p}(\\mathbf{k})$ in the frequency domain corresponds to a convolution in the spatial domain, according to the convolution theorem:\n$$ w(\\mathbf{x}) = (G * p)(\\mathbf{x}) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^2} G(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x'}) p(\\mathbf{x'}) d^2\\mathbf{x'} $$\nThe spatial Green's function $G(\\mathbf{x})$ is the inverse Fourier transform of $\\hat{G}(\\mathbf{k})$:\n$$ G(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{\\hat{G}(\\mathbf{k})\\} = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^2} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^2} \\frac{2}{E^\\star k} e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}} d^2\\mathbf{k} $$\nDue to rotational symmetry, $G$ depends only on the magnitude $r=|\\mathbf{x}|$. The integral is a standard result for the 2D inverse transform of $1/k$:\n$$ G(r) = \\frac{1}{\\pi E^\\star r} $$\nThis is the celebrated Boussinesq kernel. The convolution law is:\n$$ w(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{\\pi E^\\star} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^2} \\frac{p(\\mathbf{x'})}{|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x'}|} d^2\\mathbf{x'} $$\nThe $1/r$ singularity arises from the $1/k$ behavior of the kernel in the frequency domain. Physically, this corresponds to the response to a point load. A concentrated force $P$ at the origin corresponds to a delta function pressure $p(\\mathbf{x}) = P\\delta(\\mathbf{x})$, yielding an infinite displacement $w(0)$, which reflects the unphysical nature of infinite stress under a point load.\n\n### 3. Regularized Point Load Displacement\n\nWe model the point load $P$ with a regularized, normalized Gaussian pressure distribution:\n$$ p(x,y) = P \\rho_\\varepsilon(x,y) = \\frac{P}{2\\pi\\varepsilon^2} e^{-(x^2+y^2)/(2\\varepsilon^2)} $$\nwhere $\\varepsilon$ is the regularization length scale. We can compute the central displacement $w(\\mathbf{0})$ using either the spatial or spectral representation. The spectral method is more direct. First, we find the Fourier transform of the pressure:\n$$ \\hat{p}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\mathcal{F}\\left\\{ \\frac{P}{2\\pi\\varepsilon^2} e^{-r^2/(2\\varepsilon^2)} \\right\\} = P e^{-k^2\\varepsilon^2/2} $$\nThe transform of the displacement is $\\hat{w}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\hat{G}(k) \\hat{p}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{2 P}{E^\\star k} e^{-k^2\\varepsilon^2/2}$.\nTo find $w(\\mathbf{0})$, we compute the inverse Fourier transform at $\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}$:\n$$ w(\\mathbf{0}) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^2} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^2} \\hat{w}(\\mathbf{k}) d^2\\mathbf{k} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi^2} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^\\infty \\left( \\frac{2P}{E^\\star k} e^{-k^2\\varepsilon^2/2} \\right) k dk d\\phi $$\n$$ w(\\mathbf{0}) = \\frac{P}{\\pi E^\\star} \\int_0^\\infty e^{-k^2\\varepsilon^2/2} dk = \\frac{P}{\\pi E^\\star} \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}{2\\varepsilon} = \\frac{P}{\\sqrt{2\\pi} E^\\star \\varepsilon} $$\nAs the regularization parameter $\\varepsilon \\to 0^+$, the term $1/\\varepsilon \\to \\infty$, so $w(\\mathbf{0}) \\to \\infty$. This correctly recovers the singular behavior of the ideal point load.\n\n### 4. Uniform Pressure on a Circular Area\n\nFor a uniform pressure $p$ applied over a circular area of radius $a$, the pressure distribution is $p(r) = p$ for $r \\le a$ and $p(r) = 0$ for $r > a$. We compute the central displacement $w(\\mathbf{0})$ using the spatial convolution law derived in step 2:\n$$ w(\\mathbf{0}) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^2} G(\\mathbf{0}-\\mathbf{x'})p(\\mathbf{x'}) d\\mathbf{x'} = \\int_{|\\mathbf{x'}| \\le a} \\frac{1}{\\pi E^\\star |\\mathbf{x'}|} p \\, d\\mathbf{x'} $$\nWe switch to polar coordinates for the integration variable $\\mathbf{x'} = (r', \\theta')$, with $d\\mathbf{x'} = r'dr'd\\theta'$:\n$$ w(\\mathbf{0}) = \\frac{p}{\\pi E^\\star} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^a \\frac{1}{r'} r' dr' d\\theta' = \\frac{p}{\\pi E^\\star} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left( \\int_0^a dr' \\right) d\\theta' $$\n$$ w(\\mathbf{0}) = \\frac{p}{\\pi E^\\star} \\int_0^{2\\pi} a \\, d\\theta' = \\frac{p a}{\\pi E^\\star} [ \\theta' ]_0^{2\\pi} = \\frac{2pa}{E^\\star} $$\n\n### 5. Numerical Algorithm and Implementation\n\nThe numerical method uses the 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to implement the convolution via multiplication in the spectral domain.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  **Discretize**: Define a square domain of side $L$ on an $N \\times N$ grid. The grid spacing is $\\Delta x = L/N$. We use centered coordinate grids $x_i, y_j \\in [-L/2, L/2)$.\n2.  **Frequency Grid**: Construct the corresponding 2D frequency grid $(k_x, k_y)$ using `np.fft.fftfreq`. The wavenumbers are $k_{m} = 2\\pi m/L$ for $m \\in \\{-N/2, \\dots, N/2-1\\}$. Compute the wavenumber magnitude $k = \\sqrt{k_x^2 + k_y^2}$.\n3.  **Spectral Kernel**: Construct the discrete spectral Green's function $\\hat{G}(k_x, k_y) = 2 / (E^\\star k)$. At the zero-wavenumber point $(k_x, k_y) = (0,0)$, $k=0$ and the kernel is singular. This corresponds to a rigid body translation of the half-space, which is physically arbitrary. We set $\\hat{G}(0,0) = 0$ to remove this mode, which is equivalent to constraining the average displacement to be zero.\n4.  **Traction Field**: For each test case, construct the pressure distribution $p(x_i, y_j)$ on the spatial grid. For Gaussian loads, ensure the total discrete force $\\sum p_{ij} \\Delta x^2$ equals the prescribed force $P$.\n5.  **FFT Convolution**:\n    a. Compute the 2D FFT of the pressure grid: $\\hat{p} = \\text{fft2}(p)$.\n    b. Multiply element-wise in the frequency domain: $\\hat{w} = \\hat{p} \\cdot \\hat{G}$.\n    c. Compute the inverse 2D FFT to get the displacement field: $w = \\text{ifft2}(\\hat{w})$. The result is complex due to numerical precision, so we take the real part.\n6.  **Comparison**: Extract the numerical displacement at the center of the grid, $w_{\\text{num}}(\\mathbf{0})$, and compare it to the analytical solution $w_{\\text{an}}(\\mathbf{0})$ derived in steps 3 and 4 to compute the relative error.\n\n**Discussion of Effects:**\n-   **Periodic Images**: The FFT assumes periodic boundary conditions. This means our computation models an infinite lattice of identical loads spaced by $L$. The calculated displacement at any point includes contributions from all these \"periodic images\". This leads to an overestimation of the displacement compared to the true isolated load problem. The error is of order $1/L$ and decreases as the domain size $L$ increases relative to the load size.\n-   **Truncation/Aliasing**: The finite grid ($N$) imposes a maximum representable wavenumber (the Nyquist frequency, $k_{Nyq} = \\pi/\\Delta x$). Frequencies in the true signal higher than this are \"aliased\" to lower frequencies, introducing error. This is significant if the pressure's Fourier transform $\\hat{p}(k)$ has substantial energy beyond $k_{Nyq}$. For the smooth Gaussian pressure, $\\hat{p}(k)$ decays very rapidly, so this error is small if $\\varepsilon > \\Delta x$. For the sharp-edged circular pressure, $\\hat{p}(k)$ decays slower ($k^{-3/2}$), so aliasing errors are generally larger.\n-   **Regularization**: The mollifier parameter $\\varepsilon$ in the Gaussian case ensures the load is smooth and its spectrum is band-limited, which is crucial for accuracy with FFT-based methods. For the numerical scheme to resolve the load accurately, $\\varepsilon$ should be larger than the grid spacing $\\Delta x$. As $\\varepsilon$ approaches $\\Delta x$, the discrete representation of the Gaussian becomes poor, increasing error.\n\nThe Python code implementing this algorithm is provided in the final answer.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Boussinesq problem for a half-space under different normal traction\n    distributions using a 2D FFT-based spectral method and compares the numerical\n    results to analytical solutions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Physical and computational parameters\n    E = 70.0e9  # Young's modulus in Pa\n    nu = 0.25    # Poisson's ratio\n    L = 1.0      # Side length of the computational cell in m\n    N = 512      # Number of grid points in each direction\n\n    # Derived parameters\n    E_star = E / (1.0 - nu**2)\n    dx = L / N\n\n    # 1.
