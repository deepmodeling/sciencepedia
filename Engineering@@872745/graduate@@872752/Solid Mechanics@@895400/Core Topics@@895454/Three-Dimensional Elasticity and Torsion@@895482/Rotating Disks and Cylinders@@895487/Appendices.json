All necessary information is provided, and the objective is clear. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe analysis is based on three fundamental principles as specified: equilibrium, kinematics, and constitutive relations.\n\n1.  **Radial Equilibrium Equation**: For an axisymmetric body in cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\theta, z)$ with a body force per unit volume $F_r$, the radial equilibrium equation is:\n    $$ \\frac{d\\sigma_r}{dr} + \\frac{\\sigma_r - \\sigma_\\theta}{r} + F_r = 0 $$\n    The body force is the centrifugal force due to steady rotation at angular speed $\\omega$. For a material element of density $\\rho$ at radius $r$, the force per unit volume is $F_r = \\rho \\omega^2 r$. Substituting this into the equilibrium equation gives:\n    $$ \\frac{d\\sigma_r}{dr} + \\frac{\\sigma_r - \\sigma_\\theta}{r} + \\rho \\omega^2 r = 0 $$\n    This equation can be rearranged into a more convenient form by noting that $\\frac{d(r\\sigma_r)}{dr} = r\\frac{d\\sigma_r}{dr} + \\sigma_r$. Thus, the equilibrium equation becomes:\n    $$ \\frac{d(r\\sigma_r)}{dr} - \\sigma_\\theta + \\rho \\omega^2 r^2 = 0 \\quad (1) $$\n\n2.  **Kinematic Relations**: The problem states that the displacement field is axisymmetric and purely radial, $u = u(r)$. The radial strain $\\epsilon_r$ (strain in the radial direction) and hoop strain $\\epsilon_\\theta$ (strain in the tangential direction) are related to the displacement $u(r)$ by:\n    $$ \\epsilon_r = \\frac{du}{dr} \\quad (2a) $$\n    $$ \\epsilon_\\theta = \\frac{u}{r} \\quad (2b) $$\n\n3.  **Hooke's Law for Plane Stress**: For a homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic material under plane stress conditions ($\\sigma_z = 0$), Hooke's law relates strains to stresses as follows:\n    $$ \\epsilon_r = \\frac{1}{E} (\\sigma_r - \\nu \\sigma_\\theta) \\quad (3a) $$\n    $$ \\epsilon_\\theta = \\frac{1}{E} (\\sigma_\\theta - \\nu \\sigma_r) \\quad (3b) $$\n    where $E$ is Young's modulus and $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio.\n\nTo solve the problem, we combine these equations to derive a single differential equation for the displacement $u(r)$. First, we express the stresses in terms of strains by inverting equations $(3a)$ and $(3b)$:\n$$ \\sigma_r = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}(\\epsilon_r + \\nu \\epsilon_\\theta) $$\n$$ \\sigma_\\theta = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}(\\epsilon_\\theta + \\nu \\epsilon_r) $$\nNext, we substitute the kinematic relations $(2a)$ and $(2b)$ into these stress expressions:\n$$ \\sigma_r = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} \\left(\\frac{du}{dr} + \\nu \\frac{u}{r}\\right) \\quad (4a) $$\n$$ \\sigma_\\theta = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} \\left(\\frac{u}{r} + \\nu \\frac{du}{dr}\\right) \\quad (4b) $$\nNow, we substitute these expressions for $\\sigma_r$ and $\\sigma_\\theta$ into the equilibrium equation $(1)$.

We use a polar coordinate system $(r, \\theta)$.\n\n1.  **Kinematics (Strain-Displacement Relations):**\n    Due to axisymmetry and steady rotation, the displacement field has only a radial component that depends solely on the radius $r$. Let this displacement be $u_r = u(r)$. The tangential displacement $u_\\theta$ is zero. The in-plane strain components, radial strain $\\epsilon_r$ and hoop (tangential) strain $\\epsilon_\\theta$, are derived from the displacement field as:\n    $$ \\epsilon_r = \\frac{du}{dr} $$\n    $$ \\epsilon_\\theta = \\frac{u(r)}{r} $$\n    The shear strain $\\gamma_{r\\theta}$ is zero due to axisymmetry.\n\n2.  **Constitutive Law (Stress-Strain Relations):**\n    For a homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic material under plane stress conditions ($\\sigma_z = 0$), Hooke's law relates the in-plane stresses ($\\sigma_r, \\sigma_\\theta$) to the in-plane strains ($\\epsilon_r, \\epsilon_\\theta$):\n    $$ \\epsilon_r = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_r - \\nu\\sigma_\\theta) $$\n    $$ \\epsilon_\\theta = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_\\theta - \\nu\\sigma_r) $$\n    where $E$ is Young's modulus and $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio.

The forces acting in the radial direction must be in equilibrium. These forces include those from the radial stress $\\sigma_r$, the hoop stress $\\sigma_\\theta$, and the centrifugal body force per unit volume, $f_r = \\rho\\omega^2r$, where $\\rho$ is the mass density and $\\omega$ is the angular speed.

First, substitute the kinematic relations into the constitutive laws to express stresses in terms of displacement:\n    $$ \\sigma_r = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left(\\frac{du}{dr} + \\nu\\frac{u}{r}\\right) $$\n    $$ \\sigma_\\theta = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left(\\frac{u}{r} + \\nu\\frac{du}{dr}\\right) $$\n    Next, substitute these stress expressions into the equilibrium equation:\n    $$ \\frac{d}{dr}\\left[\\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left(\\frac{du}{dr} + \\nu\\frac{u}{r}\\right)\\right] + \\frac{1}{r}\\left[\\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left(\\frac{du}{dr} + \\nu\\frac{u}{r}\\right) - \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left(\\frac{u}{r} + \\nu\\frac{du}{dr}\\right)\\right] + \\rho\\omega^2r = 0 $$\n    Simplifying the terms and performing the differentiation yields:\n    $$ \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left(\\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} + \\frac{\\nu}{r}\\frac{du}{dr} - \\frac{\\nu u}{r^2}\\right) + \\frac{E}{(1-\\nu^2)r}\\left( (1-\\nu)\\frac{du}{dr} - (1-\\nu)\\frac{u}{r} \\right) + \\rho\\omega^2r = 0 $$\n    $$ \\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{du}{dr} - \\frac{u}{r^2} = -\\frac{1-\\nu^2}{E}\\rho\\omega^2r $$\n    This is a non-homogeneous Cauchy-Euler differential equation for $u(r)$. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution $u_h$ and a particular solution $u_p$.\n    The homogeneous equation is $r^2\\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} + r\\frac{du}{dr} - u = 0$, which has the solution $u_h(r) = C_1r + \\frac{C_2}{r}$.\n    For the particular solution, we assume a form $u_p(r) = Ar^3$. Substituting into the governing equation gives $A = -\\frac{(1-\\nu^2)\\rho\\omega^2}{8E}$.\n    The general solution for the radial displacement is:\n    $$ u(r) = C_1r + \\frac{C_2}{r} - \\frac{(1-\\nu^2)\\rho\\omega^2}{8E}r^3 $$\n    where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are integration constants.\n\n5.  **Determining Stresses and Applying Boundary Conditions:**\n    Using the general solution for $u(r)$, we derive the general expressions for the radial and hoop stresses:\n    $$ \\sigma_r(r) = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} \\left[ C_1(1+\\nu) - C_2\\frac{1-\\nu}{r^2} - \\frac{(1-\\nu^2)\\rho\\omega^2}{8E}(3+\\nu)r^2 \\right] $$\n    $$ \\sigma_\\theta(r) = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} \\left[ C_1(1+\\nu) + C_2\\frac{1-\\nu}{r^2} - \\frac{(1-\\nu^2)\\rho\\omega^2}{8E}(1+3\\nu)r^2 \\right] $$\n    The problem specifies traction-free inner and outer edges, which means the radial stress must be zero at both boundaries: $\\sigma_r(a) = 0$ and $\\sigma_r(b) = 0$. Applying these conditions gives a system of two linear equations for $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n    $$ \\frac{E}{1-\\nu}C_1 - \\frac{E}{1+\\nu}\\frac{C_2}{a^2} = \\frac{\\rho\\omega^2}{8}(3+\\nu)a^2 $$\n    $$ \\frac{E}{1-\\nu}C_1 - \\frac{E}{1+\\nu}\\frac{C_2}{b^2} = \\frac{\\rho\\omega^2}{8}(3+\\nu)b^2 $$\n    Solving this system yields the constants:\n    $$ C_1 = \\frac{(1-\\nu)(3+\\nu)\\rho\\omega^2}{8E}(a^2+b^2) $$\n    $$ C_2 = \\frac{(1+\\nu)(3+\\nu)\\rho\\omega^2}{8E}(a^2b^2) $$\n    Substituting these constants back into the stress equations gives the final stress distributions:\n    $$ \\sigma_r(r) = \\frac{3+\\nu}{8}\\rho\\omega^2 \\left( a^2+b^2 - r^2 - \\frac{a^2b^2}{r^2} \\right) $$\n    $$ \\sigma_\\theta(r) = \\frac{\\rho\\omega^2}{8} \\left( (3+\\nu)(a^2+b^2+\\frac{a^2b^2}{r^2}) - (1+3\\nu)r^2 \\right) $$\n\n6.  **Finding the Maximum Principal Stress:**\n    The principal stresses are $\\sigma_r$ and $\\sigma_\\theta$. We must find the location and magnitude of the maximum principal stress in the disk domain $r \\in [a, b]$.\n    For the radial stress $\\sigma_r$, its maximum occurs where $\\frac{d\\sigma_r}{dr}=0$. This yields $r = \\sqrt{ab}$. The maximum value is $\\sigma_{r,\\text{max}} = \\sigma_r(\\sqrt{ab}) = \\frac{3+\\nu}{8}\\rho\\omega^2(b-a)^2$.\n    For the hoop stress $\\sigma_\\theta$, its derivative is $\\frac{d\\sigma_\\theta}{dr} = \\frac{\\rho\\omega^2}{8} \\left( -(3+\\nu)\\frac{2a^2b^2}{r^3} - 2(1+3\\nu)r \\right)$. Since all constants and variables are positive, $\\frac{d\\sigma_\\theta}{dr} < 0$ for all $r>0$. Thus, $\\sigma_\\theta(r)$ is a monotonically decreasing function. Its maximum value must occur at the innermost radius, $r=a$.\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\theta,\\text{max}} = \\sigma_\\theta(a) = \\frac{\\rho\\omega^2}{8} \\left( (3+\\nu)(a^2+b^2+b^2) - (1+3\\nu)a^2 \\right) = \\frac{\\rho\\omega^2}{4}\\left((3+\\nu)b^2 + (1-\\nu)a^2\\right) $$\n    A comparison shows that $\\sigma_\\theta(a) \\ge \\sigma_r(\\sqrt{ab})$ for all valid geometries ($b \\ge a$) and material properties ($0 \\le \\nu \\le 0.5$). Therefore, the largest in-plane principal stress in the disk is the hoop stress at the inner radius:\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\text{max}} = \\sigma_\\theta(a) = \\frac{\\rho\\omega^2}{4}\\left((3+\\nu)b^2 + (1-\\nu)a^2\\right) $$\n\n7.  **Determining the Maximum Safe Angular Speed:**\n    The design criterion requires that the maximum stress does not exceed the allowable stress, $\\sigma_y/n$. The maximum safe angular speed, $\\omega_{\\text{safe}}$, is found when this condition is met with equality:\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{n} $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\rho\\omega_{\\text{safe}}^2}{4}\\left((3+\\nu)b^2 + (1-\\nu)a^2\\right) = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{n} $$\n    Solving for $\\omega_{\\text{safe}}$:\n    $$ \\omega_{\\text{safe}}^2 = \\frac{4\\sigma_y}{n\\rho\\left((3+\\nu)b^2 + (1-\\nu)a^2\\right)} $$\n    $$ \\omega_{\\text{safe}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\sigma_y}{n\\rho\\left((3+\\nu)b^2 + (1-\\nu)a^2\\right)}} $$\n    This provides the required closed-form expression.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_y}{n \\rho \\left( (3+\\nu)b^2 + (1-\\nu)a^2 \\right)}}}\n$$", "id": "2914794"}]}
