The principle of minimum potential energy provides the theoretical foundation for this approach. The total potential energy $\\Pi(u)$ for the discretized system is a quadratic function of the nodal displacements $u$, which must be minimized subject to the kinematic constraints $u_0=0$ and $u_N \\le g$.\n\nFirst, we discretize the bar of length $L$ into $N$ uniform linear finite elements. Each element has length $h=L/N$. This results in a system with $N+1$ nodes, indexed from $0$ to $N$, with corresponding axial displacements $u_0, u_1, \\dots, u_N$. The element stiffness matrix $k_e$ for a two-node bar element is given by:\n$$\nk_e = \\frac{EA}{h}\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $E$ is Young's modulus and $A$ is the cross-sectional area. The global stiffness matrix $K \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(N+1)\\times(N+1)}$ is assembled by iterating through all elements and adding their contributions to the corresponding global degrees of freedom.\n\nThe global external force vector $f \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N+1}$ is constructed by considering the concentrated force $P$ at the tip of the bar (node $N$). This results in a vector where all entries are zero except for $f_N = P$.\n\nThe essential boundary condition $u_0=0$ is handled by partitioning the system of equations. We separate the degrees of freedom into known (or prescribed) and unknown. Initially, only $u_0$ is known. The system of equations $Ku=F$ is reduced to a smaller system involving only the unknown displacements $u_1, \\dots, u_N$. Let $u_R = [u_1, \\dots, u_N]^T$ be the vector of free displacements. The reduced system is $K_{RR} u_R = f_R$, where $K_{RR}$ is the submatrix of $K$ corresponding to the free DOFs, and $f_R$ is the corresponding subvector of $f$.\n\nThe core of the problem is the unilateral contact constraint $u_N \\le g$ at the tip node. This inequality is managed using a simple and robust active-set method, which involves two main stages:\n\n1.  **Trial Step (Assume No Contact):** First, we solve the problem assuming the constraint is inactive ($\\lambda=0$). The reduced linear system $K_{RR} u_R = f_R$ is solved for $u_R$. This gives a trial displacement field, including the tip displacement, which we denote $u_N^{\\text{unc}}$. We then check if this trial solution is kinematically admissible with respect to the contact constraint. Using the specified tolerance $\\tau = 10^{-12}$, we test if $u_N^{\\text{unc}} \\le g + \\tau$.\n\n2.  **Decision and Correction (If Necessary):**\n    -   **If $u_N^{\\text{unc}} \\le g + \\tau$:** The trial solution is valid. The constraint is inactive. The final tip displacement is $u_N = u_N^{\\text{unc}}$, the contact status is `False`, and the contact reaction force $\\lambda$ is zero, as per the complementarity condition $\\lambda(u_N-g)=0$ with $u_N < g$ (or $u_N=g$ but without an enforcing reaction).\n    -   **If $u_N^{\\text{unc}} > g + \\tau$:** The trial solution violates the constraint. This means contact is active, and the constraint must be enforced as an equality, $u_N = g$. The problem is then re-solved with two prescribed displacements: $u_0=0$ and $u_N=g$. The unknown displacements are now $u_1, \\dots, u_{N-1}$. A new, smaller linear system is formed by partitioning $K$ and $f$ to solve for these internal displacements. The right-hand side of this system includes a term accounting for the effect of the prescribed non-zero displacement $g$ at node $N$. Once the full displacement vector $u$ is known (with $u_0=0$ and $u_N=g$), the final result is: the tip displacement is $u_N=g$, and the contact status is `True`. The contact reaction force $\\lambda$ is then calculated. It is the force required to maintain equilibrium while enforcing the displacement $u_N=g$. From the equilibrium equation at node $N$, $(K u)_N = f_N - \\lambda$, the reaction is computed as:\n        $$\n        \\lambda = f_N - (K u)_N\n        $$\n        This value must be non-negative, a condition which is guaranteed by the logic of activating the contact constraint only when the unconstrained displacement would have exceeded the gap.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the problem for all test cases and print the results.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Test suite from the problem statement\n    # Each case is a tuple: (E, A, L, N, P, g)\n    test_cases = [\n        (7.0e10, 1.0e-4, 2.0, 5, 3.0e3, 1.0e-2),\n        (7.0e10, 1.0e-4, 2.0, 5, 3.0e3, 1.0e-4),\n        (7.0e10, 1.0e-4, 2.0, 5, 3.0e3, 8.571428571428572e-4),\n        (7.0e10, 1.0e-4, 2.0, 5, 0.0, 1.0e-4),\n    ]\n\n    results_as_strings = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        u_N, contact_active, lambda_val = solve_case(*case)\n        # Format each result as '[u_N,contact_status,lambda]'\n        results_as_strings.append(f\"[{u_N},{str(contact_active)},{lambda_val}]\")\n    \n    # Final print statement in the exact required format\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results_as_strings)}]\")\n\ndef solve_case(E, A, L, N, P, g):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the 1D bar problem with a unilateral contact constraint for a single test case.\n\n    Args:\n        E (float): Young's modulus [Pa]\n        A (float): Cross-sectional area [m^2]\n        L (float): Length of the bar [m]\n        N (int): Number of finite elements\n        P (float): Applied axial force at the tip [N]\n        g (float): Gap to the rigid stop [m]\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A triplet containing:\n            - u_N (float): Tip displacement [m]\n            - contact_active (bool): True if contact is active, False otherwise\n            - lambda_val (float): Contact reaction force [N]\n    \"\"\"\n    num_nodes = N + 1\n    h = L / N\n    tau = 1e-12  # Numerical tolerance for contact check\n\n    # 1.

For example, an output with four results should look like: \"[x1,x2,x3,x4]\" with each $x_i$ rounded to $6$ decimal places.", "solution": "The objective is to derive the energy release rate, $G$, for a double cantilever beam (DCB) specimen under two loading conditions—constant load and constant displacement—and subsequently to determine the critical conditions for crack propagation.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental energetic quantities. The strain energy, $U$, stored in a linear elastic body is given by $U = \\frac{1}{2} P \\Delta$, where $P$ is the applied force and $\\Delta$ is the corresponding displacement. Using the given compliance function, $C(a) = \\frac{\\Delta}{P}$, where $a$ is the crack length, we can express the strain energy in terms of either the load or the displacement.\nFor a given load $P$, the displacement is $\\Delta = C(a)P$, so the strain energy is:\n$$\nU(a, P) = \\frac{1}{2} P \\left(C(a)P\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} C(a) P^2\n$$\nFor a given displacement $\\Delta$, the load is $P = \\Delta / C(a)$, so the strain energy is:\n$$\nU(a, \\Delta) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{C(a)}\\right) \\Delta = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{2 C(a)}\n$$\n\nThe energy release rate, $G$, is the rate at which energy is delivered to the crack tip for a differential increase in crack area. The crack front has a width $b$, so an infinitesimal crack advance $da$ corresponds to a new crack area $dA = b \\, da$. The energy release rate is defined as $G = -\\frac{1}{b}\\frac{d\\Pi}{da}$, where $\\Pi$ is the total potential energy of the system. The form of $\\Pi$ depends on the loading conditions.\n\nCase 1: Load Control (constant $P$)\nUnder load control, the applied force $P$ is a constant \"dead load.\" The potential of the external load is $V_{\\text{ext}} = -P\\Delta$. The total potential energy of the specimen-load system is $\\Pi = U + V_{\\text{ext}}$. Substituting the expressions for $U$ and $V_{\\text{ext}}$ gives:\n$$\n\\Pi_{LC}(a) = U - P\\Delta = \\frac{1}{2}P\\Delta - P\\Delta = -\\frac{1}{2}P\\Delta = -\\frac{1}{2} C(a) P^2\n$$\nThe total energy release rate for the specimen is $\\mathcal{G}_{total} = -\\frac{d\\Pi_{LC}}{da}$. Since $P$ is held constant during crack extension, we differentiate with respect to $a$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{G}_{total} = -\\frac{d}{da} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} C(a) P^2\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} P^2 \\frac{dC(a)}{da} = \\frac{1}{2} P^2 C'(a)\n$$\nThe energy release rate per unit width, $G$, is therefore:\n$$\nG_{LC} = \\frac{1}{b} \\mathcal{G}_{total} = \\frac{P^2}{2b} C'(a)\n$$\n\nCase 2: Displacement Control (constant $\\Delta$)\nUnder displacement control, the end opening $\\Delta$ is held fixed. No work is done by the external loading device during an infinitesimal crack extension $da$, as the points of displacement application do not move. Therefore, the change in the system's potential energy is solely the change in the stored elastic strain energy, $U$. The appropriate potential is $\\Pi_{DC} = U$.\n$$\n\\Pi_{DC}(a) = U(a, \\Delta) = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{2 C(a)}\n$$\nThe total energy release rate is $\\mathcal{G}_{total} = -\\frac{d\\Pi_{DC}}{da}$. Since $\\Delta$ is held constant, we differentiate with respect to $a$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{G}_{total} = -\\frac{d}{da} \\left(\\frac{\\Delta^2}{2 C(a)}\\right) = -\\frac{\\Delta^2}{2} \\left(-\\frac{1}{C(a)^2} C'(a)\\right) = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{2 C(a)^2} C'(a)\n$$\nThe energy release rate per unit width, $G$, is:\n$$\nG_{DC} = \\frac{1}{b} \\mathcal{G}_{total} = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{2b C(a)^2} C'(a)\n$$\nAs a consistency check, substituting $P = \\Delta/C(a)$ into the expression for $G_{LC}$ yields the expression for $G_{DC}$, confirming that the energy release rate is independent of the control mode for a given state $(P, \\Delta, a)$.\n\nNext, we establish the criterion for crack propagation. According to Griffith's theory of fracture, crack extension occurs when the energy release rate $G$ reaches a critical value, the material's fracture resistance or toughness, $G_c$. Thus, the condition for incipient crack advance is $G = G_c$.\n\nFrom the provided compliance function for the DCB specimen, $C(a) = \\frac{8a^3}{Ebh^3}$, we compute its derivative with respect to the crack length $a$:\n$$\nC'(a) = \\frac{d}{da}\\left(\\frac{8a^3}{Ebh^3}\\right) = \\frac{24a^2}{Ebh^3}\n$$\nWe now solve for the critical load $P_{\\text{crit}}$ and critical displacement $\\Delta_{\\text{crit}}$.\n\nFor load control, we set $G_{LC} = G_c$:\n$$\n\\frac{P_{\\text{crit}}^2}{2b} C'(a) = G_c \\implies P_{\\text{crit}}^2 = \\frac{2bG_c}{C'(a)}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C'(a)$:\n$$\nP_{\\text{crit}}^2 = \\frac{2bG_c}{\\frac{24a^2}{Ebh^3}} = \\frac{2bG_c Ebh^3}{24a^2} = \\frac{E G_c b^2 h^3}{12a^2}\n$$\nThus, the critical load is:\n$$\nP_{\\text{crit}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{E G_c b^2 h^3}{12 a^2}} = \\frac{bh\\sqrt{h}}{2a\\sqrt{3}}\\sqrt{EG_c}\n$$\n\nFor displacement control, we set $G_{DC} = G_c$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta_{\\text{crit}}^2}{2b C(a)^2} C'(a) = G_c \\implies \\Delta_{\\text{crit}}^2 = \\frac{2b G_c C(a)^2}{C'(a)}\n$$\nThis implies $\\Delta_{\\text{crit}} = C(a) \\sqrt{\\frac{2bG_c}{C'(a)}} = C(a) P_{\\text{crit}}$. Substituting the expressions for $C(a)$ and $P_{\\text{crit}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{crit}} = \\left(\\frac{8a^3}{Ebh^3}\\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{E G_c b^2 h^3}{12 a^2}} = \\frac{8a^3}{Ebh^3} \\frac{bh\\sqrt{E G_c h}}{2a\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{4a^2 \\sqrt{E G_c h}}{\\sqrt{3} E h^2} = \\frac{4a^2}{\\sqrt{3}h^{3/2}}\\sqrt{\\frac{G_c}{E}}\n$$\nThese final derived formulae for $P_{\\text{crit}}$ and $\\Delta_{\\text{crit}}$ are used to calculate the numerical answers for the given test cases.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for critical load or displacement for a Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) specimen.\n\n    The problem is based on linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) and the principle\n    of minimum potential energy.
