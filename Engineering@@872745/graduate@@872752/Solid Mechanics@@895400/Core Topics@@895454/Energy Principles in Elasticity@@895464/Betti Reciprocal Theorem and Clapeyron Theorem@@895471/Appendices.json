[@problem_id:2618422]", "problem": "A slender, prismatic, linearly elastic bar occupies the one-dimensional domain $x \\in [0,L]$. The axial displacement is $u(x)$, the axial force is $N(x)$, the Young’s modulus is $E$, and the cross-sectional area is $A$, all constant except in a symmetric notch neighborhood around a sensor at $x=a$, where the local axial stiffness is reduced. Specifically, in the interval $x \\in [a-c,\\,a+c]$, the effective product is $E A \\to \\eta E A$ with $0<\\eta<1$, while outside this interval the stiffness is $E A$. Assume $0<c<\\min\\{a,\\,L-a\\}$ so that the notch lies strictly inside the bar. The left end is clamped, $u(0)=0$, and the right end is traction-free, $N(L)=0$.

No other external forces are applied.\n\nA displacement sensor at $x=a$ records the axial displacement $u(a)$. You are asked to determine $u(a)$ by employing Betti’s reciprocal theorem, using as an auxiliary state the response of the same notched bar to a unit axial point force applied at $x=a$ along $+x$.

It is self-contained, consistent, and scientifically grounded. It does not violate any fundamental principles and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, a solution will be furnished.\n\nThe problem requires the displacement at a point $x=a$ in a non-uniform bar due to a body force, to be found using Betti's reciprocal theorem. This requires defining two states of loading and response for the same elastic body.\n\nFirst, the theoretical foundation of Betti's theorem is established as requested, using Clapeyron's theorem. Consider two independent loading systems, denoted by superscript $(1)$ and $(2)$, applied to the same linearly elastic body. The body is defined by its stiffness distribution $K(x) = E A(x)$. Each loading system consists of body forces $b(x)$ and boundary tractions, resulting in displacement fields $u(x)$, strain fields $\\epsilon(x) = u'(x)$, and stress fields $N(x) = K(x)\\epsilon(x)$.\n\nThe total strain energy for a superposed state $(1+2)$ is $U_{1+2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^L N^{(1+2)}\\epsilon^{(1+2)} dx$. Due to linearity, $N^{(1+2)} = N^{(1)} + N^{(2)}$ and $\\epsilon^{(1+2)} = \\epsilon^{(1)} + \\epsilon^{(2)}$.\nExpanding the energy expression gives:\n$$U_{1+2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^L (N^{(1)} + N^{(2)})(\\epsilon^{(1)} + \\epsilon^{(2)}) dx = U_1 + U_2 + \\int_0^L N^{(1)}\\epsilon^{(2)} dx$$\nwhere $U_1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^L N^{(1)}\\epsilon^{(1)} dx$ and $U_2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^L N^{(2)}\\epsilon^{(2)} dx$ are the strain energies of the individual states. The interaction energy term is $U_{12} = \\int_0^L N^{(1)}\\epsilon^{(2)} dx$. Because the constitutive relation is linear, $N^{(1)} = K(x)\\epsilon^{(1)}$, the interaction energy can be written as $\\int_0^L K(x)\\epsilon^{(1)}\\epsilon^{(2)} dx$. The symmetry of this form implies $\\int_0^L N^{(1)}\\epsilon^{(2)} dx = \\int_0^L N^{(2)}\\epsilon^{(1)} dx$.\n\nThe work done by external forces is $W_{ext}$. For the superposed state, $W_{ext}^{(1+2)} = W_{ext}^{(1)} + W_{ext}^{(2)} + W_{12} + W_{21}$, where $W_{12}$ is the work of forces of state $(1)$ on the displacements of state $(2)$, and $W_{21}$ is the work of forces of state $(2)$ on the displacements of state $(1)$.\nClapeyron's theorem states $W_{ext} = 2U$. Applying this to states $(1)$, $(2)$, and $(1+2)$:\n$W_{ext}^{(1)} = 2U_1$, $W_{ext}^{(2)} = 2U_2$, and $W_{ext}^{(1+2)} = 2U_{1+2}$.\nSubstituting these into the expanded work expression:\n$$2U_1 + 2U_2 + W_{12} + W_{21} = 2(U_1 + U_2 + \\int_0^L N^{(1)}\\epsilon^{(2)} dx)$$\nThis simplifies to $W_{12} + W_{21} = 2 \\int_0^L N^{(1)}\\epsilon^{(2)} dx$.\nThe principle of virtual work states that the external work is equal to the internal work (strain energy change). Thus, $W_{12} = \\int_0^L N^{(1)}\\epsilon^{(2)} dx$.\nSubstituting this result leads to $W_{12} + W_{21} = 2 W_{12}$, which yields Betti's reciprocal theorem: $W_{12} = W_{21}$.\n\nWe define the two states for this problem:\n**State 1 (Real State):**\n- Loading: uniform body force $b^{(1)}(x) = b_0$.\n- Boundary conditions: $u^{(1)}(0) = 0$, $N^{(1)}(L) = 0$.\n- Resulting fields: $u^{(1)}(x)$, $N^{(1)}(x)$. The quantity to be found is $u^{(1)}(a)$.\n\n**State 2 (Auxiliary State):**\n- Loading: unit point force at $x=a$, represented by a body force $b^{(2)}(x) = \\delta(x-a)$, where $\\delta$ is the Dirac delta function.\n- Boundary conditions: $u^{(2)}(0) = 0$, $N^{(2)}(L) = 0$.\n- Resulting fields: $u^{(2)}(x)$, $N^{(2)}(x)$.\n\nThe work expressions are:\n$W_{12} = \\int_0^L b^{(1)}(x) u^{(2)}(x) dx + [N^{(1)}(x) u^{(2)}(x)]_0^L$\n$W_{21} = \\int_0^L b^{(2)}(x) u^{(1)}(x) dx + [N^{(2)}(x) u^{(1)}(x)]_0^L$\n\nEvaluating these terms with the specified conditions:\nFor $W_{12}$: $[N^{(1)}(x) u^{(2)}(x)]_0^L = N^{(1)}(L)u^{(2)}(L) - N^{(1)}(0)u^{(2)}(0) = (0)u^{(2)}(L) - N^{(1)}(0)(0) = 0$.\nThus, $W_{12} = \\int_0^L b_0 u^{(2)}(x) dx = b_0 \\int_0^L u^{(2)}(x) dx$.\n\nFor $W_{21}$: $\\int_0^L b^{(2)}(x) u^{(1)}(x) dx = \\int_0^L \\delta(x-a) u^{(1)}(x) dx = u^{(1)}(a)$.\nThe boundary term is $[N^{(2)}(x) u^{(1)}(x)]_0^L = N^{(2)}(L)u^{(1)}(L) - N^{(2)}(0)u^{(1)}(0) = (0)u^{(1)}(L) - N^{(2)}(0)(0) = 0$.\nThus, $W_{21} = u^{(1)}(a)$.\n\nEquating $W_{12} = W_{21}$ gives the central relation:\n$$u^{(1)}(a) = b_0 \\int_0^L u^{(2)}(x) dx$$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the auxiliary displacement field $u^{(2)}(x)$ and integrating it over the domain.\nFor State 2, the equilibrium equation for the axial force $N^{(2)}(x)$ is $N^{(2)'}(x) + b^{(2)}(x) = 0$, which is $N^{(2)'}(x) = -\\delta(x-a)$.\nIntegrating from $x$ to $L$: $\\int_x^L N^{(2)'}(\\xi) d\\xi = -\\int_x^L \\delta(\\xi-a) d\\xi$.\n$N^{(2)}(L) - N^{(2)}(x) = -1$ if $x < a < L$, and $0$ if $a < x < L$.\nWith $N^{(2)}(L)=0$, we get $N^{(2)}(x) = 1$ for $x<a$ and $N^{(2)}(x)=0$ for $x>a$.\n\nThe displacement $u^{(2)}(x)$ is found by integrating the strain, $u^{(2)'}(x) = N^{(2)}(x)/K(x)$, with the boundary condition $u^{(2)}(0)=0$. The stiffness $K(x)$ is piecewise:\n$$K(x) = \\begin{cases} EA & 0 \\le x < a-c \\\\ \\eta EA & a-c \\le x < a+c \\\\ EA & a+c \\le x \\le L \\end{cases}$$\nWe integrate $u^{(2)'}(x)$ piecewise:\n- For $0 \\le x < a-c$: $u^{(2)'}(x) = \\frac{1}{EA}$. $u^{(2)}(x) = \\frac{x}{EA}$.\n- For $a-c \\le x < a$: $u^{(2)'}(x) = \\frac{1}{\\eta EA}$. $u^{(2)}(x) = u^{(2)}(a-c) + \\int_{a-c}^x \\frac{d\\xi}{\\eta EA} = \\frac{a-c}{EA} + \\frac{x-(a-c)}{\\eta EA}$.\n- For $a \\le x \\le L$: $u^{(2)'}(x) = \\frac{0}{K(x)} = 0$. $u^{(2)}(x)$ is constant for $x \\ge a$. Its value is $u^{(2)}(a)$.\n$u^{(2)}(a) = u^{(2)}_{x \\to a^-} = \\frac{a-c}{EA} + \\frac{a-(a-c)}{\\eta EA} = \\frac{1}{EA}\\left(a-c + \\frac{c}{\\eta}\\right)$. Thus, for $x \\ge a$, $u^{(2)}(x) = \\frac{1}{EA}\\left(a-c+\\frac{c}{\\eta}\\right)$.\n\nThe required integral $I = \\int_0^L u^{(2)}(x) dx$ is calculated by superposition. Let $u^{(2)}(x) = u^{(2)}_{unif}(x) + \\Delta u^{(2)}(x)$, where $u^{(2)}_{unif}(x)$ is the solution for a uniform bar ($\\eta=1, c=0$), and $\\Delta u^{(2)}(x)$ is the additional displacement due to the notch.\nFor a uniform bar, $u^{(2)}_{unif}(x) = \\frac{1}{EA}\\min(x,a)$. The integral is:\n$I_{unif} = \\int_0^L u^{(2)}_{unif}(x) dx = \\int_0^a \\frac{x}{EA} dx + \\int_a^L \\frac{a}{EA} dx = \\frac{1}{EA}\\left[\\frac{a^2}{2} + a(L-a) \\right] = \\frac{a(2L-a)}{2EA}$.\n\nThe additional displacement $\\Delta u^{(2)}(x)$ is non-zero only for $x > a-c$:\n- For $a-c \\le x < a$: $\\Delta u^{(2)}(x) = u^{(2)}(x) - u^{(2)}_{unif}(x) = \\frac{1}{EA}\\left(a-c+\\frac{x-a+c}{\\eta} - x\\right) = \\frac{x-a+c}{EA}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\eta}-1\\right)$.\n- For $x \\ge a$: $\\Delta u^{(2)}(x) = u^{(2)}(x) - u^{(2)}_{unif}(x) = \\frac{1}{EA}\\left(a-c+\\frac{c}{\\eta} - a\\right) = \\frac{c}{EA}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\eta}-1\\right)$.\n\nThe integral of the additional displacement is:\n$\\Delta I = \\int_{a-c}^a \\frac{x-a+c}{EA}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\eta}-1\\right) dx + \\int_a^L \\frac{c}{EA}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\eta}-1\\right) dx$\n$\\Delta I = \\frac{1}{EA}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\eta}-1\\right) \\left[ \\int_{a-c}^a (x-a+c) dx + \\int_a^L c \\,dx \\right]$\n$\\Delta I = \\frac{1}{EA}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\eta}-1\\right) \\left[ \\left[\\frac{(x-a+c)^2}{2}\\right]_{a-c}^a + [cx]_a^L \\right]$\n$\\Delta I = \\frac{1}{EA}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\eta}-1\\right) \\left[ \\frac{c^2}{2} + c(L-a) \\right] = \\frac{c}{EA}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\eta}-1\\right)\\left(L-a+\\frac{c}{2}\\right)$.\n\nThe total integral is $I = I_{unif} + \\Delta I$:\n$$I = \\frac{1}{EA}\\left[ \\frac{a(2L-a)}{2} + c\\left(\\frac{1}{\\eta}-1\\right)\\left(L-a+\\frac{c}{2}\\right) \\right]$$\n\nFinally, the displacement at the sensor is $u^{(1)}(a) = u(a) = b_0 I$.

The constants are $k=2$ and $c=1$. The system of equations for the final displacements $(u_1, u_2)$ is:\n$$ 5 = 2 u_1 + (u_1 - u_2)^3 $$\n$$ 1 = 2 u_2 - (u_1 - u_2)^3 $$\nThis nonlinear system can be solved efficiently. Adding the two equations eliminates the cubic term:\n$$ 5 + 1 = (2 u_1 + (u_1 - u_2)^3) + (2 u_2 - (u_1 - u_2)^3) $$\n$$ 6 = 2 u_1 + 2 u_2 \\implies u_1 + u_2 = 3 $$\nLet the relative displacement be $d = u_1 - u_2$. Subtracting the second original equation from the first:\n$$ 5 - 1 = (2 u_1 + d^3) - (2 u_2 - d^3) $$\n$$ 4 = 2(u_1 - u_2) + 2d^3 \\implies 4 = 2d + 2d^3 $$\nDividing by $2$ yields a cubic equation for $d$:\n$$ d^3 + d - 2 = 0 $$\nBy inspection, $d=1$ is a solution: $(1)^3 + (1) - 2 = 0$. The derivative of the function $f(d)=d^3+d-2$ is $f'(d) = 3d^2+1$, which is strictly positive for all real $d$. Thus, $f(d)$ is a strictly increasing function, and $d=1$ is the unique real solution.\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for $u_1$ and $u_2$:\n$$ u_1 + u_2 = 3 $$\n$$ u_1 - u_2 = 1 $$\nAdding these two equations gives $2u_1 = 4$, so $u_1 = 2$.\nSubstituting $u_1=2$ into the first equation gives $2 + u_2 = 3$, so $u_2 = 1$.\nThe final equilibrium displacements are $u_1 = 2\\,\\text{m}$ and $u_2 = 1\\,\\text{m}$.\n\n**Calculation of Work and Energy**\nThe internal strain energy $U_{\\text{int}}$ at the final equilibrium state $(u_1, u_2) = (2, 1)$ is:\n$$ U_{\\text{int}} = \\dfrac{2}{2}(2)^2 + \\dfrac{2}{2}(1)^2 + \\dfrac{1}{4}(1)(2 - 1)^4 = 4 + 1 + \\dfrac{1}{4} = 5.25\\,\\text{J} $$\nThe system is hyperelastic, meaning the internal forces are conservative and derivable from the potential $U_{\\text{int}}$. For a quasi-static process in a conservative system, the work done by the external forces $W_{\\text{ext}}$ is equal to the change in the internal strain energy.\n$$ W_{\\text{seq}} = \\int_{\\text{path}} \\mathbf{P} \\cdot d\\mathbf{u} = \\int_{\\text{path}} (\\nabla U_{\\text{int}}) \\cdot d\\mathbf{u} = U_{\\text{int, final}} - U_{\\text{int, initial}} $$\nSince the system starts from an undeformed state where $u_1=u_2=0$ and $U_{\\text{int, initial}}=0$, the total external work done is equal to the final internal energy, regardless of the loading path.\n$$ W_{\\text{seq}} = U_{\\text{int}} = 5.25\\,\\text{J} $$\nThe specification of the sequential loading path is irrelevant for the total work calculation in this hyperelastic case, a key feature distinguishing it from non-conservative systems.\n\n**Clapeyron's Theorem and the Quantity $\\Delta$**\nWe now compute the diagnostic quantity $U_C$:\n$$ U_C = \\dfrac{1}{2}(P_1 u_1 + P_2 u_2) = \\dfrac{1}{2}((5)(2) + (1)(1)) = \\dfrac{1}{2}(10 + 1) = \\dfrac{11}{2} = 5.5\\,\\text{J} $$\nThe difference $\\Delta$ is:\n$$ \\Delta = U_C - U_{\\text{int}} = 5.5 - 5.25 = 0.25\\,\\text{J} $$\nTo interpret this result, we note that Clapeyron's theorem, $W_{ext} = U_{int} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum P_i u_i$, is valid only for linearly elastic systems. The system under consideration is nonlinear due to the quartic term in the potential energy. The nonzero value of $\\Delta$ quantifies the failure of Clapeyron's theorem.\n\nA deeper analysis reveals the source of this difference. From the equilibrium equations, we can write:\n$$ P_1 u_1 + P_2 u_2 = (k u_1 + c d^3)u_1 + (k u_2 - c d^3)u_2 = k u_1^2 + k u_2^2 + c d^3(u_1 - u_2) = k u_1^2 + k u_2^2 + c d^4 $$\nwhere $d = u_1 - u_2$.\nThen, $U_C$ can be expressed in terms of the displacements:\n$$ U_C = \\dfrac{1}{2}(k u_1^2 + k u_2^2 + c d^4) = \\dfrac{k}{2}u_1^2 + \\dfrac{k}{2}u_2^2 + \\dfrac{c}{2}d^4 $$\nThe difference $\\Delta$ is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta = U_C - U_{\\text{int}} = \\left(\\dfrac{k}{2}u_1^2 + \\dfrac{k}{2}u_2^2 + \\dfrac{c}{2}d^4\\right) - \\left(\\dfrac{k}{2}u_1^2 + \\dfrac{k}{2}u_2^2 + \\dfrac{c}{4}d^4\\right) = \\dfrac{c}{4}d^4 $$\nThis confirms our numerical calculation, since $\\Delta = \\dfrac{1}{4}(1)^4 = 0.25$. The sign is positive because $c>0$. This indicates that for this \"stiffening\" system (where the force increases more than linearly with displacement), the actual stored energy $U_{\\text{int}}$ is less than the value $U_C$ predicted by the linear formula. The quantity $U_C$ overestimates the stored energy for a stiffening system.\n\n**Maxwell-Betti Reciprocity**\nFor small perturbations $(\\delta u_1, \\delta u_2)$ around the final equilibrium state, the incremental forces are related by the tangent stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}_T$:\n$$ \\mathbf{K}_T = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 U_{\\text{int}}}{\\partial u_1^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 U_{\\text{int}}}{\\partial u_1 \\partial u_2} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 U_{\\text{int}}}{\\partial u_2 \\partial u_1} & \\frac{\\partial^2 U_{\\text{int}}}{\\partial u_2^2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} k + 3c(u_1-u_2)^2 & -3c(u_1-u_2)^2 \\\\ -3c(u_1-u_2)^2 & k + 3c(u_1-u_2)^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSince $U_{\\text{int}}$ is a smooth function, the order of differentiation does not matter, and $\\mathbf{K}_T$ is symmetric. This symmetry is the mathematical basis for the incremental form of Maxwell-Betti reciprocity. At the final state ($k=2$, $c=1$, $d=1$), the matrix is:\n$$ \\mathbf{K}_T = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 & -3 \\\\ -3 & 5 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe compliance matrix is $\\mathbf{C}_T = \\mathbf{K}_T^{-1} = \\frac{1}{16}\\begin{pmatrix} 5 & 3 \\\\ 3 & 5 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe displacement at node $2$ due to an incremental unit load at node $1$ is $\\delta u^{(1)}_2 = C_{T,21} = 3/16$.\nThe displacement at node $1$ due to an incremental unit load at node $2$ is $\\delta u^{(2)}_1 = C_{T,12} = 3/16$.\nSince $\\delta u^{(1)}_2 = \\delta u^{(2)}_1$, Maxwell-Betti reciprocity holds for small perturbations.
