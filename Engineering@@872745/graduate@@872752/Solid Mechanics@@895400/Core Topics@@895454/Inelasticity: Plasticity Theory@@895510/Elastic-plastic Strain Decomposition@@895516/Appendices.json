It is scientifically grounded in the established theory of plasticity for small strains. The principle of additive strain decomposition is a cornerstone of this theory. The concept of elastic unloading following a linear stress-strain path governed by Young's modulus is also a standard and physically realistic assumption for metals. The provided numerical values for stress, strain, and Young's modulus are consistent and physically plausible for a high-strength metallic alloy such as steel. The problem is well-posed, with sufficient information provided to determine a unique solution for the requested quantities. The language is objective and precise, with no ambiguities. Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\nThe fundamental premise for this problem is the additive decomposition of the total strain, $\\varepsilon$, into its elastic component, $\\varepsilon^{e}$, and its plastic component, $\\varepsilon^{p}$. Under the small-strain assumption, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\varepsilon = \\varepsilon^{e} + \\varepsilon^{p} $$\nThis decomposition is valid at every point during the deformation history, including the specified state of interest, where the total strain is $\\varepsilon^{\\ast}$ and the stress is $\\sigma^{\\ast}$. Thus, we have:\n$$ \\varepsilon^{\\ast} = \\varepsilon^{e} + \\varepsilon^{p} $$\nHere, $\\varepsilon^{e}$ and $\\varepsilon^{p}$ represent the elastic and plastic strain components, respectively, at the state $(\\varepsilon^{\\ast}, \\sigma^{\\ast})$.\n\nThe problem states that the unloading process is purely elastic and linear. This implies that the elastic strain component, $\\varepsilon^{e}$, is related to the stress, $\\sigma$, through Hooke's Law for uniaxial loading:\n$$ \\sigma = E \\varepsilon^{e} $$\nHere, $E$ is the Young's modulus of the material. This relationship holds for the entire elastic domain, and therefore it must hold at the point of unloading, $(\\varepsilon^{\\ast}, \\sigma^{\\ast})$. The elastic strain at this point is the strain that would be recovered upon complete unloading to zero stress. We can thus solve for the elastic strain, $\\varepsilon^{e}$, at the stress level $\\sigma^{\\ast}$:\n$$ \\varepsilon^{e} = \\frac{\\sigma^{\\ast}}{E} $$\nThis equation provides the means to calculate the elastic part of the total strain $\\varepsilon^{\\ast}$.\n\nWith the expression for $\\varepsilon^{e}$ established, we return to the additive decomposition equation to find the plastic strain component, $\\varepsilon^{p}$:\n$$ \\varepsilon^{p} = \\varepsilon^{\\ast} - \\varepsilon^{e} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\varepsilon^{e}$ from Hooke's Law, we obtain the final expression for the plastic strain:\n$$ \\varepsilon^{p} = \\varepsilon^{\\ast} - \\frac{\\sigma^{\\ast}}{E} $$\n\nWe now proceed to evaluate these expressions numerically using the provided data.\nThe given values are:\n- $\\varepsilon^{\\ast} = 0.0120$\n- $\\sigma^{\\ast} = 1.050~\\text{GPa}$\n- $E = 210~\\text{GPa}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the elastic strain, $\\varepsilon^{e}$.
