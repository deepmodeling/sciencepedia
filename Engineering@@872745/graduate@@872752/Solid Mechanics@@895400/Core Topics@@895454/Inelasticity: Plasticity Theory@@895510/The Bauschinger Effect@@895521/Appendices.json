A complete solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation of the stress-strain relationship and the reverse yield stress follows the three stages of the specified loading path.\n\n**Stage 1: Initial Tensile Loading**\nThis stage consists of an elastic segment followed by a plastic segment.\n\n- **Elastic Loading ($0 \\leq \\varepsilon \\leq \\sigma_{y0}/E$)**:\nInitially, a material point is at $(\\sigma, \\varepsilon, \\varepsilon^p, \\alpha) = (0, 0, 0, 0)$. The response is purely elastic, so $\\varepsilon^p = 0$ and $\\alpha = 0$. The stress is related to strain by Hooke's law: $\\sigma = E\\varepsilon$. The tangent modulus is $E$. Yielding commences when the yield function $f=0$ is satisfied: $|\\sigma - 0| - \\sigma_{y0} = 0$, which for tension gives $\\sigma = \\sigma_{y0}$. The strain at this point is $\\varepsilon_y = \\sigma_{y0}/E$.\n\n- **Elastoplastic Loading ($\\sigma_{y0}/E  \\varepsilon \\leq \\varepsilon_{\\max}$)**:\nFor strains exceeding $\\varepsilon_y$, the material yields and deforms plastically. The yield condition $f=0$ must remain satisfied. For tensile loading where $\\sigma  \\alpha$, this is $\\sigma - \\alpha = \\sigma_{y0}$.\nThe consistency condition requires $df=0$ during plastic flow, which here implies $d\\sigma - d\\alpha = 0$.\nThe rate-form constitutive relations are:\n1. Strain decomposition: $d\\varepsilon = d\\varepsilon^e + d\\varepsilon^p$\n2. Elastic response: $d\\varepsilon^e = d\\sigma/E$\n3. Hardening rule: $d\\alpha = C d\\varepsilon^p$\nFrom consistency ($d\\sigma = d\\alpha$) and the hardening rule, we have $d\\sigma = C d\\varepsilon^p$, which means $d\\varepsilon^p = d\\sigma/C$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $d\\varepsilon^e$ and $d\\varepsilon^p$ into the strain decomposition gives:\n$d\\varepsilon = \\frac{d\\sigma}{E} + \\frac{d\\sigma}{C} = \\left(\\frac{1}{E} + \\frac{1}{C}\\right) d\\sigma = \\frac{E+C}{EC}d\\sigma$\nThe tangent modulus in the plastic region is the inverse relationship, $E_T = \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\varepsilon} = \\frac{EC}{E+C}$.\nThe stress-strain curve in this region is a straight line with slope $E_T$ starting from the point $(\\sigma_{y0}, \\varepsilon_y)$.\n\nAt the point of maximum tensile strain, $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_{\\max}$, we determine the values of the state variables. The plastic strain accumulated, $\\varepsilon^p_{\\max}$, is found by integrating $d\\varepsilon^p$:\n$d\\varepsilon^p = d\\varepsilon - d\\varepsilon^e = d\\varepsilon - \\frac{d\\sigma}{E} = d\\varepsilon - \\frac{E_T}{E}d\\varepsilon = \\left(1 - \\frac{E_T}{E}\\right)d\\varepsilon$\n$d\\varepsilon^p = \\left(1 - \\frac{C}{E+C}\\right)d\\varepsilon = \\frac{E}{E+C}d\\varepsilon$\nIntegrating from the onset of yield ($\\varepsilon_y$) to the maximum strain ($\\varepsilon_{\\max}$):\n$\\varepsilon^p_{\\max} = \\int_{\\varepsilon_y}^{\\varepsilon_{\\max}} \\frac{E}{E+C} d\\varepsilon = \\frac{E}{E+C}(\\varepsilon_{\\max} - \\varepsilon_y)$\nUsing the definition $\\Delta\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_{\\max} - \\sigma_{y0}/E = \\varepsilon_{\\max} - \\varepsilon_y$, we get:\n$\\varepsilon^p_{\\max} = \\frac{E}{E+C}\\Delta\\varepsilon$\nThe backstress, $\\alpha_{\\max}$, at $\\varepsilon_{\\max}$ is found by integrating the hardening law:\n$\\alpha_{\\max} = \\int_0^{\\varepsilon^p_{\\max}} C d\\varepsilon^p = C \\varepsilon^p_{\\max} = C \\left(\\frac{E}{E+C}\\Delta\\varepsilon\\right) = \\frac{CE}{E+C}\\Delta\\varepsilon$\n\n**Stage 2: Elastic Unloading to Zero Stress**\nUpon unloading from $\\varepsilon_{\\max}$, the response is purely elastic. The plastic strain and backstress remain frozen at their maximum values, $\\varepsilon^p = \\varepsilon^p_{\\max}$ and $\\alpha = \\alpha_{\\max}$. The tangent modulus is $E$. The stress-strain path follows:\n$\\sigma - \\sigma_{\\max} = E(\\varepsilon - \\varepsilon_{\\max})$\nThis continues until the stress becomes zero. At $\\sigma=0$, the remaining total strain is the permanent plastic strain: $\\varepsilon |_{\\sigma=0} = \\varepsilon^p_{\\max}$.\n\n**Stage 3: Compressive Reloading and Reverse Yield**\nFrom the state $(\\sigma, \\varepsilon, \\alpha) = (0, \\varepsilon^p_{\\max}, \\alpha_{\\max})$, the material is reloaded in compression. The initial response is elastic, following $\\sigma = E(\\varepsilon - \\varepsilon^p_{\\max})$.\nReverse yielding occurs when the stress state again satisfies the yield condition $f=0$:\n$f(\\sigma, \\alpha_{\\max}) = |\\sigma - \\alpha_{\\max}| - \\sigma_{y0} = 0$\nAs loading is compressive, the stress $\\sigma$ is negative. The backstress $\\alpha_{\\max}$ is positive because $C0$, $E0$, and $\\Delta\\varepsilon0$. Therefore, the term $\\sigma - \\alpha_{\\max}$ is negative. The yield condition becomes:\n$-(\\sigma - \\alpha_{\\max}) - \\sigma_{y0} = 0$\n$\\alpha_{\\max} - \\sigma - \\sigma_{y0} = 0$\nThe reverse yield stress, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{rev}}$, is the value of $\\sigma$ that satisfies this equation:\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{rev}} = \\alpha_{\\max} - \\sigma_{y0}$\nThis result shows that the magnitude of the yield stress in compression, $|\\sigma_{\\mathrm{rev}}| = |\\alpha_{\\max} - \\sigma_{y0}| = \\sigma_{y0} - \\alpha_{\\max}$ (for $\\alpha_{\\max}  \\sigma_{y0}$), is reduced compared to the initial compressive yield stress magnitude of $\\sigma_{y0}$. This phenomenon is the Bauschinger effect.\nSubstituting the derived expression for $\\alpha_{\\max}$:\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{rev}} = \\frac{CE}{E+C}\\Delta\\varepsilon - \\sigma_{y0}$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression for the reverse yield stress.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{CE}{E+C}\\Delta\\varepsilon - \\sigma_{y0}}$$", "id": "2693921"}, {"introduction": "Real materials rarely exhibit purely kinematic hardening; their yield surface both shifts and expands.

This tensor must have a unit Frobenius norm, $\\|\\mathbf{n}\\| = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{n}:\\mathbf{n}} = 1$. The direction of the deviatoric stress is given by the tensor $\\mathbf{M} = \\mathbf{e}_{1} \\otimes \\mathbf{e}_{1} - \\frac{1}{3}\\mathbf{I}$. Its self-inner product is $\\mathbf{M}:\\mathbf{M} = (\\frac{2}{3})^{2} + (-\\frac{1}{3})^{2} + (-\\frac{1}{3})^{2} = \\frac{4}{9} + \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{2}{3}$.

The plastic strain at the end of this loading phase, which we denote as $\\varepsilon_{\\text{pre}}^p$, is:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\text{pre}}^p = \\frac{E}{E+C+H} \\left(\\varepsilon_{\\text{pre}} - \\frac{\\sigma_{y0}}{E}\\right) $$\nThe other internal variable, the backstress $\\alpha$, at this point is:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\text{pre}} = C\\varepsilon_{\\text{pre}}^p $$\nThese two quantities, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{pre}}^p$ and $\\alpha_{\\text{pre}}$, define the internal state of the material at the point of load reversal.\n\n**Part 2: Unloading and Compressive Reloading**\n\nThe problem states that the bar is elastically unloaded from the prestrained state to three different reversal stresses $\\sigma_{r,1}$, $\\sigma_{r,2}$, and $\\sigma_{r,3}$. During elastic unloading, by definition, there is no further plastic deformation, so $d\\varepsilon^p=0$. Consequently, the internal state variables remain constant throughout the unloading process:\n$$ \\varepsilon^p = \\varepsilon_{\\text{pre}}^p \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\alpha = \\alpha_{\\text{pre}} $$\nThe size of the yield surface, which depends on $\\varepsilon^p$, is also frozen at $\\sigma_y(\\varepsilon_{\\text{pre}}^p) = \\sigma_{y0} + H\\varepsilon_{\\text{pre}}^p$.\n\nFrom each reversal point $\\sigma_{r,i}$, the bar is reloaded in compression. This reloading is initially elastic, during which the internal state remains unchanged. Yielding will resume when the stress state $(\\sigma, \\alpha, \\varepsilon^p)$ once again satisfies the yield condition. The stress at which this occurs is the reverse yield stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{rev}}$.\n$$ |\\sigma_{\\text{rev}} - \\alpha_{\\text{pre}}| - \\sigma_y(\\varepsilon_{\\text{pre}}^p) = 0 $$\nFor compressive loading, the stress $\\sigma_{\\text{rev}}$ will be negative. Given that $\\alpha_{\\text{pre}}$ is positive (as it results from tensile plastic strain), the term inside the absolute value, $\\sigma_{\\text{rev}} - \\alpha_{\\text{pre}}$, is negative. Thus, the absolute value is resolved as:\n$$ -(\\sigma_{\\text{rev}} - \\alpha_{\\text{pre}}) = \\sigma_y(\\varepsilon_{\\text{pre}}^p) $$\nSolving for $\\sigma_{\\text{rev}}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{rev}} = \\alpha_{\\text{pre}} - \\sigma_y(\\varepsilon_{\\text{pre}}^p) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\alpha_{\\text{pre}}$ and $\\sigma_y(\\varepsilon_{\\text{pre}}^p)$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{rev}} = (C\\varepsilon_{\\text{pre}}^p) - (\\sigma_{y0} + H\\varepsilon_{\\text{pre}}^p) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{rev}} = (C-H)\\varepsilon_{\\text{pre}}^p - \\sigma_{y0} $$\nThis expression for the reverse yield stress depends only on the material properties and the plastic strain accumulated during the initial tensile loading. It is independent of the stress $\\sigma_{r,i}$ from which compressive reloading begins, provided that $\\sigma_{r,i}$ is within the elastic range defined by the state at $\\varepsilon_{\\text{pre}}$. Therefore, the reverse yield stress will be the same for all three cases: $\\sigma_{\\text{rev},1} = \\sigma_{\\text{rev},2} = \\sigma_{\\text{rev},3} = \\sigma_{\\text{rev}}$.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe now substitute the given values:\n$E = 210000\\,\\text{MPa}$, $\\sigma_{y0} = 250\\,\\text{MPa}$, $H = 1500\\,\\text{MPa}$, $C = 10000\\,\\text{MPa}$, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{pre}} = 0.012$.\n\nFirst, calculate the plastic strain $\\varepsilon_{\\text{pre}}^p$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\text{pre}}^p = \\frac{210000}{210000 + 10000 + 1500} \\left(0.012 - \\frac{250}{210000}\\right) $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\text{pre}}^p = \\frac{210000}{221500} \\left(0.012 - 0.001190476...\\right) = \\frac{2100}{2215} (0.010809523...) $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\text{pre}}^p = \\frac{420}{443} \\times \\frac{227}{21000} = \\frac{227}{443 \\times 50} = \\frac{227}{22150} \\approx 0.010248307 $$\nNow, calculate the reverse yield stress $\\sigma_{\\text{rev}}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{rev}} = (10000 - 1500)\\varepsilon_{\\text{pre}}^p - 250 = 8500 \\left(\\frac{227}{22150}\\right) - 250 $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{rev}} = \\frac{8500 \\times 227}{22150} - 250 = \\frac{170 \\times 227}{443} - 250 = \\frac{38590}{443} - 250 $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{rev}} = \\frac{38590 - 250 \\times 443}{443} = \\frac{38590 - 110750}{443} = \\frac{-72160}{443} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{rev}} \\approx -162.8893905\\,\\text{MPa} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $-162.9\\,\\text{MPa}$.\n\nAs established, this result is identical for all three reversal points. The three compressive reverse yield stresses are $\\sigma_{\\text{rev},1} = \\sigma_{\\text{rev},2} = \\sigma_{\\text{rev},3} = -162.9\\,\\text{MPa}$.\n\nWe can verify that the unloading is indeed elastic. The flow stress at $\\varepsilon_{\\text{pre}}$ is:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{pre}} = \\sigma_{y0} + (C+H)\\varepsilon_{\\text{pre}}^p = 250 + (11500)\\frac{227}{22150} = 250 + \\frac{1150 \\times 227}{2215} \\approx 250 + 117.8555 = 367.8555\\,\\text{MPa} $$\nThe elastic range at this point is $[\\sigma_{\\text{rev}}, \\sigma_{\\text{pre}}]$, which is approximately $[-162.9, 367.9]\\,\\text{MPa}$. The reversal stresses $\\sigma_{r,1}=300\\,\\text{MPa}$, $\\sigma_{r,2}=150\\,\\text{MPa}$, and $\\sigma_{r,3}=0\\,\\text{MPa}$ are all strictly within this range, confirming the validity of our approach.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} -162.9  -162.9  -162.9 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2693944"}]}
