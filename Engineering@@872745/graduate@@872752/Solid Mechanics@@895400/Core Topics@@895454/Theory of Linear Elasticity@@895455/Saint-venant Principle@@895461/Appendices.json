Methodology: The solution must employ the balance of linear and angular momentum, superposition, Saint-Venant’s principle, and the uniqueness theorem for linear elasticity.\n\nNow, I validate the problem.\nThe problem is a standard exercise in the theory of linear elasticity, specifically concerning the application of Saint-Venant’s principle. It is scientifically grounded, as it is based on the well-established equations of continuum mechanics and linear elasticity. The problem is well-posed; the geometry, material properties, and boundary conditions are specified sufficiently to determine a unique stress field (up to a rigid body motion, which is implicitly constrained). The language used is objective and mathematically precise. The problem is not trivial and directly tests the conceptual understanding of how complex load distributions are treated in the far-field. There are no contradictions or factual errors. Therefore, the problem is declared valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows.\nAccording to Saint-Venant's principle, at a distance from the region of load application that is large compared to the dimensions of the loaded area, the stress field depends only on the statically equivalent resultant force and moment of the applied traction, not on the specific details of the traction distribution.\nThe given traction $t_z(x,y)$ at the end $z=0$ can be replaced by its statically equivalent system, consisting of a resultant force $\\mathbf{F}$ and a resultant moment $\\mathbf{M}_O$ with respect to the centroid of the cross-section, which is at the origin $(0,0,0)$.\n\nThe resultant force is purely axial, $\\mathbf{F} = F_z\\,\\mathbf{e}_z$, where $F_z$ is calculated by integrating the traction over the cross-sectional area $A$, which spans from $x=-a$ to $x=a$ and $y=-b$ to $y=b$.\n$$F_z = \\int_A t_z(x,y) \\,dA = \\int_{-b}^{b} \\int_{-a}^{a} p_0 \\left[ 1 + c_1 \\frac{x}{a} + c_2 \\frac{y}{b} + c_3 \\left( \\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} \\right) \\right] \\,dx\\,dy$$\nWe evaluate the integral term by term. The integrals of terms containing odd powers of $x$ or $y$ over the symmetric rectangular domain are zero.\n$$ \\int_{-b}^{b} \\int_{-a}^{a} c_1 \\frac{x}{a} \\,dx\\,dy = 0 $$\n$$ \\int_{-b}^{b} \\int_{-a}^{a} c_2 \\frac{y}{b} \\,dx\\,dy = 0 $$\nThe integral of the term with $c_3$ is:\n$$ \\int_{-b}^{b} \\int_{-a}^{a} c_3 \\left( \\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} \\right) \\,dx\\,dy = c_3 \\left[ \\frac{1}{a^2} \\int_A x^2 \\,dA - \\frac{1}{b^2} \\int_A y^2 \\,dA \\right] = c_3 \\left( \\frac{I_y}{a^2} - \\frac{I_x}{b^2} \\right) $$\nThe moments of inertia for the rectangular cross-section are $I_y = \\int_A x^2 \\,dA = \\frac{4a^3b}{3}$ and $I_x = \\int_A y^2 \\,dA = \\frac{4ab^3}{3}$.\nSubstituting these gives:\n$$ c_3 \\left( \\frac{4a^3b/3}{a^2} - \\frac{4ab^3/3}{b^2} \\right) = c_3 \\left( \\frac{4ab}{3} - \\frac{4ab}{3} \\right) = 0 $$\nThus, the only non-zero contribution to the force is from the constant term:\n$$ F_z = \\int_A p_0 \\,dA = p_0 A = p_0 (2a)(2b) = 4ab p_0 $$\n\nThe resultant moment $\\mathbf{M}_O$ about the origin is $\\mathbf{M}_O = \\int_A \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{t} \\,dA$, where $\\mathbf{r} = x\\,\\mathbf{e}_x + y\\,\\mathbf{e}_y$ and $\\mathbf{t} = t_z\\,\\mathbf{e}_z$.\n$$ \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{t} = (x\\,\\mathbf{e}_x + y\\,\\mathbf{e}_y) \\times (t_z\\,\\mathbf{e}_z) = y\\,t_z\\,\\mathbf{e}_x - x\\,t_z\\,\\mathbf{e}_y $$\nThe components of the moment are $M_x = \\int_A y\\,t_z \\,dA$ and $M_y = \\int_A -x\\,t_z \\,dA$.\nFor $M_x$:\n$$ M_x = \\int_A y\\,p_0 \\left[ 1 + c_1 \\frac{x}{a} + c_2 \\frac{y}{b} + c_3 \\left( \\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} \\right) \\right] \\,dA $$\nThe only term that does not integrate to zero is the one with $y^2$:\n$$ M_x = \\int_A y\\,p_0 \\left( c_2 \\frac{y}{b} \\right) \\,dA = \\frac{p_0 c_2}{b} \\int_A y^2 \\,dA = \\frac{p_0 c_2}{b} I_x = \\frac{p_0 c_2}{b} \\left( \\frac{4ab^3}{3} \\right) = \\frac{4ab^2 c_2 p_0}{3} $$\nFor $M_y$:\n$$ M_y = \\int_A -x\\,p_0 \\left[ 1 + c_1 \\frac{x}{a} + c_2 \\frac{y}{b} + c_3 \\left( \\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} \\right) \\right] \\,dA $$\nThe only non-zero contribution is from the term with $x^2$:\n$$ M_y = \\int_A -x\\,p_0 \\left( c_1 \\frac{x}{a} \\right) \\,dA = -\\frac{p_0 c_1}{a} \\int_A x^2 \\,dA = -\\frac{p_0 c_1}{a} I_y = -\\frac{p_0 c_1}{a} \\left( \\frac{4a^3b}{3} \\right) = -\\frac{4a^2b c_1 p_0}{3} $$\n\nThe far-field stress state $\\sigma_{zz}(x,y)$ is the one that produces these same resultants. This is the well-known solution for combined axial loading and biaxial bending of a prismatic bar:\n$$ \\sigma_{zz}(x,y) = \\frac{F_z}{A} + \\frac{M_x}{I_x}y - \\frac{M_y}{I_y}x $$\nSubstituting the values for the resultants and geometric properties:\n$$ \\sigma_{zz}(x,y) = \\frac{4ab p_0}{4ab} + \\frac{4ab^2 c_2 p_0/3}{4ab^3/3}y - \\frac{-4a^2b c_1 p_0/3}{4a^3b/3}x $$\n$$ \\sigma_{zz}(x,y) = p_0 + \\frac{c_2 p_0}{b}y + \\frac{c_1 p_0}{a}x $$\n$$ \\sigma_{zz}(x,y) = p_0 \\left( 1 + c_1 \\frac{x}{a} + c_2 \\frac{y}{b} \\right) $$\nThis expression represents the stress field far from the end $z=0$. The uniqueness theorem guarantees this is the correct far-field solution, as the stress field due to the self-equilibrated part of the load, $p_0 c_3 (x^2/a^2 - y^2/b^2)$, must decay with distance from the plane of application, becoming negligible at $z=z_0 \\gg a,b$.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this far-field stress at the specified point $(x^{\\star},y^{\\star}) = \\left(\\frac{a}{2},-\\frac{b}{2}\\right)$:\n$$ \\sigma_{zz}\\left(\\frac{a}{2}, -\\frac{b}{2}\\right) = p_0 \\left( 1 + c_1 \\frac{a/2}{a} + c_2 \\frac{-b/2}{b} \\right) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{zz}\\left(\\frac{a}{2}, -\\frac{b}{2}\\right) = p_0 \\left( 1 + \\frac{c_1}{2} - \\frac{c_2}{2} \\right) $$\nThis is the final expression for the stress at the requested point and location.

It is a well-posed boundary value problem, a classic topic in continuum mechanics often used to illustrate Saint-Venant's principle. The problem statement is objective, self-contained, and mathematically formalizable. It is free of scientific inaccuracies, contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\nStep 3: Verdict\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing the three tasks in order.\n\nTask 1: Argument from First Principles\nThe governing equations of linear elasticity are linear. Therefore, the principle of superposition is applicable. We consider a \"difference\" problem for the displacement field $\\Delta\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{u}^{(B)} - \\mathbf{u}^{(A)}$ and its associated strain and stress fields, $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ and $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$. This difference problem is itself a valid problem of linear elasticity.\n\nThe boundary conditions for this difference problem are as follows:\n- On the lateral surface $r=a$ for $z > 0$, both original problems specify traction-free conditions. Thus, the traction for the difference problem is also zero: $\\Delta\\mathbf{t}|_{r=a} = \\mathbf{t}^{(B)}|_{r=a} - \\mathbf{t}^{(A)}|_{r=a} = \\mathbf{0} - \\mathbf{0} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n- On the end face $z=0$, the traction for the difference problem is $\\Delta\\mathbf{t}|_{z=0} = \\mathbf{t}^{(B)} - \\mathbf{t}^{(A)}$. Since both original tractions are purely tangential ($t_{\\theta}$), the difference traction is also purely tangential, given by $\\Delta t_{\\theta}(r) = t_{\\theta}^{(B)}(r) - t_{\\theta}^{(A)}(r)$. All other components of traction, $\\Delta t_r$ and $\\Delta t_z$, are zero.\n\nWe must examine the static resultant of the traction $\\Delta t_{\\theta}(r)$ applied at $z=0$. The resultant torque about the $z$-axis is given by:\n$$ \\Delta T = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{a} r (\\Delta t_{\\theta}(r)) r \\, dr \\, d\\theta = \\int_{0}^{a} 2\\pi r^2 (t_{\\theta}^{(B)}(r) - t_{\\theta}^{(A)}(r)) \\, dr $$\n$$ \\Delta T = \\int_{0}^{a} 2\\pi r^2 t_{\\theta}^{(B)}(r) \\, dr - \\int_{0}^{a} 2\\pi r^2 t_{\\theta}^{(A)}(r) \\, dr = T - T = 0 $$\nThe resultant forces in all directions are also zero because the applied tractions are purely circumferential. Thus, the system of tractions applied to the end face $z=0$ in the difference problem is statically self-equilibrated; its resultant force and resultant moment are both zero.\n\nAccording to Saint-Venant's principle, the stresses and strains due to a self-equilibrated system of loads decay with distance from the region of load application. In this case, the self-equilibrated load is applied at $z=0$. Therefore, the stress field $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ must be significant only in a region near the end face $z=0$ and must decay to negligible values as $z$ increases. This confirms the statement in the first task. The uniqueness theorem ensures that this decaying stress field is the only possible solution for the difference problem under the condition that stresses vanish at $z \\to \\infty$.\n\nTask 2: Derivation for Axisymmetric Torsion\nFor a state of axisymmetric torsion, the displacement field has only one non-zero component, $u_{\\theta}$, which depends only on $r$ and $z$: $\\mathbf{u} = u_{\\theta}(r,z)\\mathbf{e}_{\\theta}$. The strain-displacement relations in cylindrical coordinates yield two non-zero strain components:\n$$ \\epsilon_{r\\theta} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_{\\theta}}{\\partial r} - \\frac{u_{\\theta}}{r} \\right), \\quad \\epsilon_{\\theta z} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial u_{\\theta}}{\\partial z} $$\nFor an isotropic, linearly elastic material, the corresponding shear stresses are:\n$$ \\sigma_{r\\theta} = 2G\\epsilon_{r\\theta} = G \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_{\\theta}}{\\partial r} - \\frac{u_{\\theta}}{r} \\right), \\quad \\sigma_{\\theta z} = 2G\\epsilon_{\\theta z} = G\\frac{\\partial u_{\\theta}}{\\partial z} $$\nwhere $G$ is the shear modulus. All other stress components are zero.\nIn the absence of body forces, the equations of equilibrium $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbf{0}$ reduce to a single non-trivial equation (the $\\theta$-component):\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{r\\theta}}{\\partial r} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{\\theta z}}{\\partial z} + \\frac{2\\sigma_{r\\theta}}{r} = 0 $$\nSubstituting the stress-displacement relations into the equilibrium equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left[ G \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_{\\theta}}{\\partial r} - \\frac{u_{\\theta}}{r} \\right) \\right] + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left[ G \\frac{\\partial u_{\\theta}}{\\partial z} \\right] + \\frac{2}{r} \\left[ G \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_{\\theta}}{\\partial r} - \\frac{u_{\\theta}}{r} \\right) \\right] = 0 $$\nAssuming the shear modulus $G$ is constant, we divide by it and simplify the expression:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u_{\\theta}}{\\partial r^2} - \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial u_{\\theta}}{\\partial r} + \\frac{u_{\\theta}}{r^2} \\right) + \\frac{\\partial^2 u_{\\theta}}{\\partial z^2} + \\left( \\frac{2}{r}\\frac{\\partial u_{\\theta}}{\\partial r} - \\frac{2u_{\\theta}}{r^2} \\right) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 u_{\\theta}}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial u_{\\theta}}{\\partial r} - \\frac{u_{\\theta}}{r^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u_{\\theta}}{\\partial z^2} = 0 $$\nThis is the governing partial differential equation for $u_{\\theta}(r,z)$. We seek a separable solution for the disturbance field of the form $u_{\\theta}(r,z) = R(r)\\,\\exp(-kz)$, where $k > 0$ ensures decay as $z \\to \\infty$. Substituting this into the PDE yields:\n$$ \\left( R''(r) + \\frac{1}{r}R'(r) - \\frac{R(r)}{r^2} \\right)\\exp(-kz) + R(r) (k^2)\\exp(-kz) = 0 $$\nDividing by $\\exp(-kz)$ gives an ordinary differential equation for $R(r)$:\n$$ R''(r) + \\frac{1}{r}R'(r) + \\left(k^2 - \\frac{1}{r^2}\\right) R(r) = 0 $$\nMultiplying by $r^2$ gives $r^2 R''(r) + r R'(r) + (k^2 r^2 - 1) R(r) = 0$. By letting $x=kr$, this transforms to $x^2 R'' + x R' + (x^2-1)R=0$, which is Bessel's equation of order $\\nu=1$.\nThe general solution for $R(r)$ is $R(r) = C_1 J_1(kr) + C_2 Y_1(kr)$, where $J_1$ and $Y_1$ are Bessel functions of the first and second kind of order $1$.\nThe displacement must be finite at the axis of the cylinder, $r=0$. Since $Y_1(kr) \\to -\\infty$ as $r \\to 0$, physical regularity requires $C_2=0$. Thus, $R(r) = C_1 J_1(kr)$.\nThe lateral surface at $r=a$ is traction-free, which requires $\\sigma_{r\\theta}|_{r=a}=0$. The stress component $\\sigma_{r\\theta}$ is:\n$$ \\sigma_{r\\theta}(r,z) = G \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_{\\theta}}{\\partial r} - \\frac{u_{\\theta}}{r} \\right) = G C_1 \\exp(-kz) \\left( k J_1'(kr) - \\frac{J_1(kr)}{r} \\right) $$\nApplying the boundary condition at $r=a$:\n$$ k J_1'(ka) - \\frac{J_1(ka)}{a} = 0 $$\nWe use the Bessel function identity $x J'_{\\nu}(x) = \\nu J_{\\nu}(x) - x J_{\\nu+1}(x)$. For $\\nu=1$, this is $x J'_1(x) = J_1(x) - x J_2(x)$. Applying this with $x=ka$:\n$$ ka J_1'(ka) = J_1(ka) - ka J_2(ka) \\implies J_1'(ka) = \\frac{J_1(ka)}{ka} - J_2(ka) $$\nSubstituting this into the boundary condition:\n$$ k \\left( \\frac{J_1(ka)}{ka} - J_2(ka) \\right) - \\frac{J_1(ka)}{a} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{J_1(ka)}{a} - k J_2(ka) - \\frac{J_1(ka)}{a} = 0 $$\n$$ -k J_2(ka) = 0 $$\nSince we seek a decaying solution ($k \\neq 0$), the eigenvalue condition for the admissible decay rates $k_n$ is $J_2(k_n a) = 0$.\n\nTask 3: Characteristic Decay Length\nThe admissible values for $k a$ are the positive roots of the Bessel function of the second order, $J_2(x)=0$. Let these roots be denoted by $\\lambda_n$, where $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$. Thus, $k_n a = \\lambda_n$, which implies $k_n = \\lambda_n / a$.\nThe smallest positive eigenvalue, $k_1$, corresponds to the first positive root, $\\lambda_1$, of $J_2(x)$.\n$$ k_1 = \\frac{\\lambda_1}{a} $$\nFrom standard tables of mathematical functions, the first positive root of $J_2(x)$ is $\\lambda_1 \\approx 5.1356223$.\nThe characteristic decay length $\\ell$ is defined as the reciprocal of the smallest positive decay rate $k_1$:\n$$ \\ell = \\frac{1}{k_1} = \\frac{a}{\\lambda_1} $$\nThe problem asks for the ratio $c = \\ell/a$.\n$$ c = \\frac{\\ell}{a} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_1} $$\nUsing the value of $\\lambda_1$:\n$$ c = \\frac{1}{5.1356223\\ldots} \\approx 0.194721\\ldots $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $c = 0.1947$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.1947}\n$$", "id": "2928625"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of a characteristic decay rate, this final practice tackles a critical engineering question: how far is \"far enough\"?

Define, for each section $x=\\text{const}$, the maximum axial stress difference\n$$\n\\Delta \\sigma_{\\max}(x) \\equiv \\max_{(y,z)\\in\\Omega} \\left| \\Delta \\sigma_{xx}(x,y,z) \\right|.\n$$\nLet $\\sigma_{b,\\max}(x)$ denote the maximum Euler–Bernoulli bending stress on the section computed from the common bending moment $M(x)$ and the rectangular geometry, that is, $\\sigma_{b,\\max}(x) = |M(x)|\\,c/I$ with $c$ the distance from the neutral axis to the extreme fiber and $I$ the second moment of area of the rectangle about the bending axis.\n\nUsing only the governing equations of equilibrium in three-dimensional linear elasticity, the principle of superposition, the uniqueness theorem for boundary value problems, and the quantified content of Saint–Venant’s principle (that end effects generated by self-equilibrated tractions decay exponentially with distance from the loaded end), derive an estimate for a distance $x_{\\eta}$ such that for all $x \\ge x_{\\eta}$, the inequality\n$$\n\\Delta \\sigma_{\\max}(x) \\le \\eta \\,\\sigma_{b,\\max}(x)\n$$\nholds for a prescribed small fraction $\\eta \\in (0,1)$.\n\nIn your derivation, specialize to the rectangular cross-section and show that the slowest exponential decay rate is governed by the smallest positive separation constant $\\lambda_{\\min}$ of the two-dimensional Neumann eigenvalue problem on $\\Omega$, and compute $\\lambda_{\\min}$ explicitly in terms of $b$ and $h$.\n\nFinally, evaluate your estimate numerically for $b = 40\\,\\text{mm}$, $h = 80\\,\\text{mm}$, and $\\eta = 0.01$, under the conservative normalization that immediately beyond the loaded end one has $\\Delta \\sigma_{\\max}(0^{+}) = \\sigma_{b,\\max}(0^{+})$. Express the distance $x_{\\eta}$ in meters and round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The three-dimensional equilibrium equations of linear elasticity (without body forces) are $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{0}$ in the body, together with traction boundary conditions $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\boldsymbol{n} = \\boldsymbol{t}$ on the loaded end and $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\boldsymbol{n} = \\boldsymbol{0}$ on the lateral surface. The solutions are unique up to rigid motions under standard well-posedness assumptions, as guaranteed by the uniqueness theorem.\n\nBy the principle of superposition, the difference field $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{(1)} - \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{(2)}$ satisfies the homogeneous equilibrium equations\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{0}\n$$\nin the bar, with traction boundary conditions\n$$\n\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\,\\boldsymbol{n} =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\boldsymbol{t}^{(1)} - \\boldsymbol{t}^{(2)} & \\text{on } x=0,\\\\\n\\boldsymbol{0} & \\text{on the lateral surface } x>0.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nBy construction, the end traction difference $\\boldsymbol{t}^{(1)} - \\boldsymbol{t}^{(2)}$ is self-equilibrated: it has zero net force and zero net moment resultants over the end section, because the two original loadings produce identical internal shear force and bending moment distributions and there are no axial or torsional resultants. Consequently, $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ represents a pure end effect.\n\nSaint–Venant’s principle, in its quantified form for prismatic bodies, asserts that fields generated by self-equilibrated end tractions decay exponentially with distance from the loaded end. This can be seen by representing the solution in separated form along the longitudinal coordinate $x$. In the absence of body forces and with traction-free lateral surfaces, one can expand the difference field in a series of longitudinally decaying modes\n$$\n\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(x,y,z) \\sim \\sum_{k} \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{k}(y,z)\\,\\exp(-\\lambda_{k} x),\n$$\nwhere the cross-sectional mode shapes $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{k}(y,z)$ and decay rates $\\lambda_{k} > 0$ are determined by a two-dimensional eigenvalue problem posed on the cross-section. The slowest decay is controlled by the smallest positive decay rate $\\lambda_{\\min}$; at sufficiently large $x$,\n$$\n\\Delta \\sigma_{\\max}(x) \\lesssim C\\,\\exp(-\\lambda_{\\min} x)\\,\\Delta \\sigma_{\\max}(0^{+}),\n$$\nfor some dimensionless constant $C$ depending only on geometric normalization and the choice of norm. For an order-of-magnitude estimate consistent with the spirit of Saint–Venant’s principle, it is customary to take $C$ of order unity and adopt a conservative normalization for the initial amplitude.\n\nTo identify $\\lambda_{\\min}$ for a rectangular cross-section, we recall that the longitudinally decaying modes arise from a separation-of-variables reduction of the three-dimensional linear elasticity problem to a two-dimensional spectral problem on the cross-section, which, in the simplest representation for end effects without lateral tractions, reduces to a scalar Helmholtz-type eigenvalue problem with Neumann boundary conditions on $\\partial \\Omega$. Specifically, the cross-sectional dependence of the stress or displacement potentials satisfies\n$$\n-\\Delta_{\\perp} \\phi(y,z) = \\lambda^{2} \\,\\phi(y,z) \\quad \\text{in } \\Omega, \\qquad \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial n} = 0 \\quad \\text{on } \\partial \\Omega,\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta_{\\perp}$ is the two-dimensional Laplacian on the $y$–$z$ plane, and the Neumann boundary condition reflects the traction-free lateral surfaces. The zero eigenvalue $\\lambda=0$ corresponds to rigid-body or polynomial modes that are excluded by self-equilibration constraints (zero resultant force and zero first moments). Thus, the relevant decay rates are the positive square roots of the nonzero Neumann eigenvalues on the rectangle.\n\nFor a rectangle of side lengths $b$ (in $y$) and $h$ (in $z$), the Neumann eigenfunctions are products of cosines, and the corresponding eigenvalues are\n$$\n\\lambda_{m n} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{m \\pi}{b}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{n \\pi}{h}\\right)^{2}}, \\qquad m,n \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0},\n$$\nwith $(m,n) \\ne (0,0)$. The constraints of self-equilibration at the end remove the $(0,0)$ mode; modes with either $m \\ge 1, n=0$ or $m=0, n \\ge 1$ are admissible and have zero cross-sectional average, thereby satisfying the zero resultant condition. Among these admissible modes, the smallest positive decay rate is\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\min} = \\min\\!\\left\\{ \\frac{\\pi}{b},\\,\\frac{\\pi}{h} \\right\\} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\max\\{b,h\\}}.\n$$\nThis shows that the slowest decay (largest penetration distance) is governed by the largest cross-sectional dimension.\n\nWith this characterization, a conservative estimate for the required distance $x_{\\eta}$ ensuring\n$$\n\\Delta \\sigma_{\\max}(x) \\le \\eta \\,\\sigma_{b,\\max}(x)\n$$\ncan be obtained by bounding the ratio of the difference field to the classical bending stress by a single decaying exponential, normalized at the end section. Adopting the conservative normalization\n$$\n\\Delta \\sigma_{\\max}(0^{+}) = \\sigma_{b,\\max}(0^{+}),\n$$\nand taking the modal prefactor $C$ as unity for a conservative bound, we impose\n$$\n\\exp(-\\lambda_{\\min} x_{\\eta}) \\le \\eta,\n$$\nwhich yields the estimate\n$$\nx_{\\eta} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\min}} \\,\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\right) = \\frac{\\max\\{b,h\\}}{\\pi} \\,\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\right).\n$$\n\nWe now evaluate this expression for the given data.
