The displacement field, $\\mathbf{u}$, provides a complete picture of how every point in a body moves. This first exercise guides you through the process of translating this kinematic description into a quantitative measure of local deformation—the infinitesimal strain tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$. By working through this foundational calculation, you will reinforce the connection between the displacement gradient and strain, and learn to distinguish between changes in volume (dilatation) and changes in shape (distortion) [@problem_id:2620349].", "problem": "Consider a linearly elastic, homogeneous, and simply connected solid body undergoing small deformations so that the linearized kinematics are valid. The displacement field is prescribed as $u_{x}(x,y,z)=a\\,x$, $u_{y}(x,y,z)=b\\,y$, $u_{z}(x,y,z)=c\\,z$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constant real parameters with $|a|,|b|,|c|\\ll 1$. Starting from the fundamental definitions of the displacement gradient, the infinitesimal strain tensor, and the infinitesimal rotation tensor, do the following: compute all components of the infinitesimal strain tensor, compute the volumetric strain (defined as the trace of the infinitesimal strain tensor), compute the infinitesimal rotation tensor to assess whether the deformation is irrotational, and classify the deformation in terms of its volumetric and distortional character by stating algebraic conditions on $a$, $b$, and $c$ under which it is a pure dilatation, an isochoric distortion, or a general triaxial stretch. Use only balance and kinematic principles appropriate to small-strain elastostatics; do not invoke any finite-deformation measures. For grading purposes, report only the volumetric strain as your final answer, expressed symbolically and dimensionlessly.

It is well-posed, scientifically sound, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. We shall proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe displacement field is provided in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$ as $\\mathbf{u}(x,y,z)$. Its components are given by:\n$u_x(x,y,z) = a\\,x$\n$u_y(x,y,z) = b\\,y$\n$u_z(x,y,z) = c\\,z$\nwhere $a$, $b$, and $c$ are small, real constants, satisfying $|a|, |b|, |c| \\ll 1$. This condition justifies the use of linearized, or infinitesimal, strain theory.\n\nFirst, we compute the displacement gradient tensor, $\\mathbf{H}$, whose components $H_{ij}$ are defined as the partial derivatives of the displacement components with respect to the spatial coordinates, $H_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j}$. Let $x_1=x$, $x_2=y$, $x_3=z$.\n\nThe components of $\\mathbf{H}$ are:\n$H_{11} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial(a\\,x)}{\\partial x} = a$\n$H_{22} = \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial(b\\,y)}{\\partial y} = b$\n$H_{33} = \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial(c\\,z)}{\\partial z} = c$\n\nAll off-diagonal components are zero, for example:\n$H_{12} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial(a\\,x)}{\\partial y} = 0$\n$H_{21} = \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial(b\\,y)}{\\partial x} = 0$\nThis holds for all $i \\neq j$. Thus, the displacement gradient tensor is a diagonal matrix:\n$$\n\\mathbf{H} = \\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & b & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & c \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe displacement gradient tensor $\\mathbf{H}$ can be decomposed into a symmetric part, the infinitesimal strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, and a skew-symmetric part, the infinitesimal rotation tensor $\\boldsymbol{W}$. This is the fundamental Helmholtz decomposition of a second-order tensor: $\\mathbf{H} = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} + \\boldsymbol{W}$.\n\nThe infinitesimal strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ is defined as $\\varepsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} (H_{ij} + H_{ji})$. Since our calculated $\\mathbf{H}$ is already a symmetric matrix ($H_{ij} = H_{ji}$), its skew-symmetric part is zero and its symmetric part is itself.\nTherefore, the infinitesimal strain tensor is identical to the displacement gradient tensor:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\mathbf{H} = \\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & b & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & c \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe components of the strain tensor are:\n$\\varepsilon_{xx} = a$, $\\varepsilon_{yy} = b$, $\\varepsilon_{zz} = c$.\nThe shear strain components are all zero: $\\varepsilon_{xy} = \\varepsilon_{yz} = \\varepsilon_{zx} = 0$.\n\nNext, we compute the volumetric strain, $\\varepsilon_V$, which is defined as the trace of the infinitesimal strain tensor, $\\varepsilon_V = \\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})$.\n$$\n\\varepsilon_V = \\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy} + \\varepsilon_{zz}\n$$\nSubstituting the components we have found:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_V = a + b + c\n$$\nThis quantity represents the infinitesimal change in volume per unit original volume.\n\nThe infinitesimal rotation tensor $\\boldsymbol{W}$ is defined as $W_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} (H_{ij} - H_{ji})$. Since $\\mathbf{H}$ is symmetric, all components of $\\boldsymbol{W}$ are identically zero.\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{W} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\mathbf{H} - \\mathbf{H}^T) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a-a & 0-0 & 0-0 \\\\ 0-0 & b-b & 0-0 \\\\ 0-0 & 0-0 & c-c \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nA zero rotation tensor signifies that the deformation is irrotational. Such a deformation is also called a pure strain or pure stretch.\n\nFinally, we classify the deformation. The strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ can be decomposed into a spherical part (related to volume change) and a deviatoric part (related to shape change or distortion).\n$\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{\\text{spherical}} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{\\text{deviatoric}}$\nThe spherical part is given by $\\frac{1}{3}\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\mathbf{I} = \\frac{1}{3}(a+b+c)\\mathbf{I}$.\nThe deviatoric part is $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}' = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} - \\frac{1}{3}\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\mathbf{I}$.\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}' = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} 2a-b-c & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2b-a-c & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2c-a-b \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe deformation is classified as follows:\n$1$. **Pure Dilatation**: A purely volumetric change with no distortion. This occurs when the deviatoric strain tensor is zero, $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}' = \\mathbf{0}$. This requires that all diagonal elements of $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}'$ are zero, which leads to the condition $a=b=c$. In this case, there is uniform expansion or contraction in all directions.\n\n$2$. **Isochoric Distortion**: A purely distortional change of shape with no change in volume. \"Isochoric\" means volume-preserving. This occurs when the volumetric strain is zero, $\\varepsilon_V = 0$. The algebraic condition is therefore $a+b+c=0$.\n\n$3$. **General Triaxial Stretch**: This is the most general case for this deformation field, where there is both a change in volume and a change in shape. This occurs when neither of the above two special conditions is met, i.e., when $(a,b,c)$ are not all equal AND $a+b+c \\neq 0$.\n\nThe problem requires a single final answer, which is the symbolic expression for the volumetric strain.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{a+b+c}$$", "id": "2620349"}, {"introduction": "While strain describes the geometry of deformation, stress describes the internal forces that arise in response. The Cauchy stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, provides a complete description of the state of stress at a point, but its physical meaning is revealed through its action on surfaces.

Express the final answer without units.", "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the traction vector on a specified plane within a body subject to a given state of stress. The solution must be derived from first principles, namely the local balance of linear momentum.\n\nLet the traction vector acting on an infinitesimally small surface element with area $dA$ and outward unit normal $\\mathbf{n}$ be denoted by $\\mathbf{t}$. By definition, the force exerted across this surface element is $d\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{t} dA$.\n\nTo relate the traction vector $\\mathbf{t}$ to the state of stress at the point, we consider the equilibrium of an infinitesimal tetrahedron with three of its faces oriented normal to the Cartesian coordinate axes $\\mathbf{e}_1, \\mathbf{e}_2, \\mathbf{e}_3$, and its fourth, oblique face having an area $dA$ and an outward unit normal $\\mathbf{n}$. Let the vertex opposite to the oblique face be at the origin of a local coordinate system. The areas of the other three faces are $dA_1 = (\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_1) dA = n_1 dA$, $dA_2 = n_2 dA$, and $dA_3 = n_3 dA$, with their outward normals being $-\\mathbf{e}_1, -\\mathbf{e}_2, -\\mathbf{e}_3$, respectively.\n\nThe traction vectors on the faces with normals $\\mathbf{e}_1$, $\\mathbf{e}_2$, and $\\mathbf{e}_3$ are denoted as $\\mathbf{t}^{(1)}$, $\\mathbf{t}^{(2)}$, and $\\mathbf{t}^{(3)}$. By Cauchy's lemma, the traction on a surface with an opposite normal is the negative of the original traction, i.e., $\\mathbf{t}^{(-\\mathbf{n})} = -\\mathbf{t}^{(\\mathbf{n})}$. Therefore, the forces on the three Cartesian faces are $-\\mathbf{t}^{(1)} dA_1$, $-\\mathbf{t}^{(2)} dA_2$, and $-\\mathbf{t}^{(3)} dA_3$.\n\nThe equation for the balance of linear momentum requires that the sum of all forces, including surface forces and body forces $\\mathbf{b}$ acting on the volume $dV$, equals the rate of change of linear momentum (mass times acceleration, $\\rho \\mathbf{a} dV$):\n$$\n\\mathbf{t} dA - \\mathbf{t}^{(1)} dA_1 - \\mathbf{t}^{(2)} dA_2 - \\mathbf{t}^{(3)} dA_3 + \\mathbf{b} dV = \\rho \\mathbf{a} dV\n$$\nSubstituting $dA_i = n_i dA$ and dividing the entire equation by $dA$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\mathbf{t} - n_1 \\mathbf{t}^{(1)} - n_2 \\mathbf{t}^{(2)} - n_3 \\mathbf{t}^{(3)} + (\\mathbf{b} - \\rho \\mathbf{a}) \\frac{dV}{dA} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nThe volume of the tetrahedron is $dV = \\frac{1}{3} h dA$, where $h$ is the altitude from the vertex to the oblique face. As the tetrahedron shrinks to the material point, $h \\to 0$, and thus the term $\\frac{dV}{dA} \\to 0$. The body force and inertial terms vanish in this limit, regardless of their magnitude, yielding the local relationship known as Cauchy's stress theorem:\n$$\n\\mathbf{t} = n_1 \\mathbf{t}^{(1)} + n_2 \\mathbf{t}^{(2)} + n_3 \\mathbf{t}^{(3)} = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} n_j \\mathbf{t}^{(j)}\n$$\nThe Cauchy stress tensor $\\sigma$ is introduced to relate these traction vectors to the coordinate system. Its components $\\sigma_{ji}$ are defined as the $i$-th component of the traction vector $\\mathbf{t}^{(j)}$ acting on the face with normal $\\mathbf{e}_j$. That is, $\\mathbf{t}^{(j)} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\sigma_{ji} \\mathbf{e}_i$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\mathbf{t}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{t} = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} n_j \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\sigma_{ji} \\mathbf{e}_i \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\sigma_{ji} n_j \\right) \\mathbf{e}_i\n$$\nThe $i$-th component of the traction vector, $t_i$, is therefore given by $t_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\sigma_{ji} n_j$. In matrix notation, this corresponds to the operation $\\mathbf{t} = \\sigma^T \\mathbf{n}$, where $\\mathbf{t}$ and $\\mathbf{n}$ are represented as column vectors.\n\nHowever, the local balance of angular momentum in a non-polar continuum (one without body couples) requires the stress tensor to be symmetric, i.e., $\\sigma = \\sigma^T$ or $\\sigma_{ij} = \\sigma_{ji}$.
