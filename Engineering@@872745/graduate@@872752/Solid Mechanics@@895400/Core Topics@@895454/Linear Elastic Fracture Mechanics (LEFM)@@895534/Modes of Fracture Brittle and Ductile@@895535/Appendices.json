The film contains a single dominant flaw that can be idealized as a straight, through-thickness, mode I crack. Depending on material properties, flaw size, and film thickness, the failure can be brittle (unstable crack extension governed by linear elastic fracture mechanics) or ductile (widespread plastic flow preceding any unstable crack extension). Using only the following foundational bases and definitions from solid mechanics, devise an algorithm that determines the failure mode:\n- Energy balance for crack extension posits that crack growth is possible if and only if the energy release rate equals or exceeds a critical value. The stress intensity factor relates to the energy release rate through a constitutive modulus that depends on the state of constraint.\n- In linear elastic fracture mechanics, the applied stress intensity factor for mode I loading is proportional to the far-field tensile stress and to the square root of a characteristic flaw dimension, times a dimensionless geometry factor that encodes the crack and specimen shape.\n- The onset of macroscopic plastic flow is determined by the yield strength under the assumed stress state. If macroscopic yielding precedes the attainment of the toughness-controlled threshold, the failure is ductile-dominated; otherwise, it is brittle-dominated.\n\nYour task is to write a program that, for a specified set of material, geometric, and stress parameters, classifies the outcome into one of the following integer codes:\n- $0$: No failure (neither macroscopic yielding nor unstable crack extension under the given stress).\n- $1$: Brittle fracture (unstable crack extension occurs before macroscopic yielding would occur).\n- $2$: Ductile yielding without unstable fracture (macroscopic yielding occurs, but the applied stress is insufficient to reach the crack instability threshold).\n- $3$: Ductile fracture (macroscopic yielding occurs before the crack instability threshold, yet the applied stress is high enough that unstable crack extension would ultimately occur under continued loading).\n\nAssumptions and modeling choices:\n- Adopt small-scale yielding and linear elastic fracture mechanics for the crack stability assessment. Use the classical mode I stress intensity representation for a single dominant crack with a supplied dimensionless geometry factor $Y$.\n- Treat the thin film as homogeneous and isotropic with Young’s modulus $E$ and Poisson’s ratio $\\nu$. The substrate merely enforces the residual stress field and does not alter the local fracture criterion beyond the supplied geometry factor $Y$.\n- Use the yield strength $\\sigma_{y}$ as the onset criterion for macroscopic plasticity.\n- Use the plane strain fracture toughness $K_{Ic}$ provided as the material’s toughness parameter.

The problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a rigorous solution. Therefore, a solution is warranted.\n\nThe analysis is predicated on two fundamental tenets of solid mechanics:\n$1$. The onset of widespread plastic deformation (yielding) in the material is governed by a critical stress, the yield strength $\\sigma_y$. Failure is considered ductile if macroscopic yielding initiates. This occurs when the applied stress, $\\sigma$, reaches $\\sigma_y$.\n$$ \\sigma \\ge \\sigma_y $$\n$2$. The onset of unstable crack propagation (fracture) is governed by linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). For a Mode I crack, this occurs when the stress intensity factor, $K_I$, reaches the material's plane strain fracture toughness, $K_{Ic}$.\n$$ K_I \\ge K_{Ic} $$\n\nThe stress intensity factor, $K_I$, quantifies the magnitude of the stress field singularity at the crack tip. For a through-thickness crack of half-length $a$ in a body under a uniform far-field tensile stress $\\sigma$, $K_I$ is given by the classical relation:\n$$ K_I = Y \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a} $$\nwhere $Y$ is a dimensionless geometry factor that depends on the crack and specimen configuration.\n\nTo determine the failure mode, we must first identify which failure mechanism is initiated at a lower stress. We compute the critical stress required to initiate fracture, denoted $\\sigma_{\\text{fracture}}$, by setting $K_I = K_{Ic}$ in the previous equation and solving for $\\sigma$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{fracture}} = \\frac{K_{Ic}}{Y \\sqrt{\\pi a}} $$\nThe core of the classification logic involves a comparison between three stress values: the intrinsic material yield strength, $\\sigma_y$; the derived critical stress for fracture, $\\sigma_{\\text{fracture}}$; and the actual applied residual stress in the film, $\\sigma_r$.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\nFirst, we establish the material's inherent failure tendency by comparing the two critical stress thresholds, $\\sigma_{\\text{fracture}}$ and $\\sigma_y$. This comparison must account for numerical precision using the specified relative tolerance of $10^{-6}$.\n- If $\\sigma_{\\text{fracture}}  \\sigma_y$, the material is inherently brittle. Under increasing load, it will fracture before it yields.\n- If $\\sigma_y  \\sigma_{\\text{fracture}}$, the material is inherently ductile. It will yield before it fractures.\n- If $\\sigma_{\\text{fracture}} \\approx \\sigma_y$ (within the tolerance), the material is at the brittle-ductile transition.\n\nSecond, we compare the applied residual stress $\\sigma_r$ to these thresholds to determine the actual outcome.\n\nThe complete classification logic is as follows:\n\n1.  **Tie Condition**: If $\\sigma_{\\text{fracture}}$ and $\\sigma_y$ are effectively equal (within the relative tolerance of $10^{-6}$):\n    - If $\\sigma_r$ is less than this common threshold, there is no failure (Code $0$).\n    - If $\\sigma_r$ is equal to or greater than this threshold, failure occurs. As per the problem's tie-breaking rule to reflect concomitant plasticity, this is classified as ductile fracture (Code $3$).\n\n2.  **Brittle-Dominated Regime**: If $\\sigma_{\\text{fracture}}  \\sigma_y$:\n    - If $\\sigma_r  \\sigma_{\\text{fracture}}$, the applied stress is insufficient to initiate fracture (the lower-energy failure path). Thus, there is no failure (Code $0$).\n    - If $\\sigma_r \\ge \\sigma_{\\text{fracture}}$, the applied stress is sufficient to cause unstable crack growth. Since this occurs at a stress level below the yield strength, it is brittle fracture (Code $1$).\n\n3.  **Ductile-Dominated Regime**: If $\\sigma_y  \\sigma_{\\text{fracture}}$:\n    - If $\\sigma_r  \\sigma_y$, the applied stress is below both thresholds. There is no failure (Code $0$).\n    - If $\\sigma_y \\le \\sigma_r  \\sigma_{\\text{fracture}}$, the stress is sufficient to cause yielding but not fracture. This is ductile yielding without unstable fracture (Code $2$).\n    - If $\\sigma_r \\ge \\sigma_{\\text{fracture}}$, the stress is high enough to cause fracture. However, since the material would have already yielded at a lower stress ($\\sigma_y$), this is classified as ductile fracture (Code $3$).\n\nThe input parameters of Young's modulus $E$, Poisson's ratio $\\nu$, and film thickness $t$, while essential for a more comprehensive mechanical analysis (e.g., determining the validity of plane strain conditions or calculating the energy release rate $G = K_I^2(1-\\nu^2)/E$), are not required for the specific classification logic mandated by the problem statement, which is based solely on a comparison of stresses and the direct use of $K_{Ic}$.\n\nAll length units must be converted to meters to maintain dimensional consistency with stresses in MPa ($10^6$ Pa) and fracture toughness in MPa$\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run the failure mode classification for all test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Test suite from the problem statement.\n    # Format: (E, nu, K_Ic, sigma_y, t, a, sigma_r, Y)\n    # Units: E(GPa), nu(-), K_Ic(MPa.m^0.5), sigma_y(MPa), t(um), a(um), sigma_r(MPa), Y(-)\n    test_cases = [\n        (250, 0.23, 1.0, 3500, 0.5, 1.0, 1200, 1.12),\n        (70, 0.33, 30.0, 150, 1.0, 0.05, 300, 1.12),\n        (3.0, 0.35, 2.0, 50, 10.0, 100.0, 120, 1.12),\n        (200, 0.30, 50.0, 500, 2.0, 0.2, 100, 1.12),\n        (100, 0.28, 2.0, 225.568, 5.0, 20.0, 225.568, 1.12),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        # Unpack case parameters, ignoring unused ones E, nu, t\n        _, _, k_ic, sigma_y, _, a_um, sigma_r, y_factor = case\n        \n        # Classify the failure mode for the current case\n        classification_code = classify_failure_mode(k_ic, sigma_y, a_um, sigma_r, y_factor)\n        results.append(classification_code)\n\n    # Format the final output as specified\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\ndef classify_failure_mode(k_ic, sigma_y, a_um, sigma_r, y_factor):\n    \"\"\"\n    Classifies the failure mode based on material, geometric, and stress parameters.\n\n    Args:\n        k_ic (float): Plane strain fracture toughness in MPa.m^0.5\n        sigma_y (float): Yield strength in MPa\n        a_um (float): Half-crack length in micrometers\n        sigma_r (float): Residual tensile stress in MPa\n        y_factor (float): Dimensionless geometry factor\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The failure classification code (0, 1, 2, or 3).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Convert half-crack length from micrometers to meters for consistency\n    a_m = a_um * 1e-6\n    \n    # Calculate the critical stress required for fracture\n    sigma_fracture = k_ic / (y_factor * np.sqrt(np.pi * a_m))\n    \n    rel_tol = 1e-6\n\n    def is_close(v1, v2):\n        \"\"\"Checks if two positive values are close within a relative tolerance.\"\"\"\n        return abs(v1 - v2) = rel_tol * max(v1, v2)\n\n    def is_ge(v1, v2):\n        \"\"\"Checks if v1 is greater than or approximately equal to v2.\"\"\"\n        return v1  v2 or is_close(v1, v2)\n\n    def is_lt(v1, v2):\n        \"\"\"Checks if v1 is strictly less than v2.\"\"\"\n        return v1  v2 and not is_close(v1, v2)\n\n    # Main classification logic based on comparing stresses\n    \n    if is_close(sigma_fracture, sigma_y):\n        # Case C: Tie between thresholds (brittle-ductile transition)\n        if is_ge(sigma_r, sigma_y):\n            # Applied stress meets/exceeds the common threshold.

Betti’s reciprocal theorem and the near-tip singular fields imply that for a semi-infinite crack, the Mode I SIF induced by a normal traction distribution $p(r)$ acting symmetrically across the two crack faces in the crack wake is\n$$\nK[p] \\;=\\; \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{p(r)}{\\sqrt{r}}\\, \\mathrm{d}r,\n$$\nwith the understanding that tractions that oppose crack opening contribute with a negative sign to the net SIF when superposed with remotely applied opening loads. In our sign convention, both $p_{b}(r)$ and $p_{c}(r)$ are closing tractions; hence they reduce the SIF.
