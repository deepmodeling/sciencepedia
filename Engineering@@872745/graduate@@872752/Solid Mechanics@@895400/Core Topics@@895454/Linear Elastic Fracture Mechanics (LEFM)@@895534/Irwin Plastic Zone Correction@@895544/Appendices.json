It is scientifically grounded, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive a unique solution. We therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe objective is to determine the radial distance from the crack tip, $r_p$, at which plastic yielding begins, directly ahead of the crack ($\\theta=0$). This location marks the boundary of the plastic zone. The analysis is conducted under plane stress conditions, using the von Mises yield criterion.\n\nThe problem provides the asymptotic stress field near the tip of a Mode I crack:\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij}(r,\\theta) = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} f_{ij}(\\theta)\n$$\nwhere $K_I$ is the Mode I stress intensity factor, and $(r, \\theta)$ are polar coordinates centered at the crack tip.

In the presence of small-scale yielding, Irwin introduced an effective crack length $a_{\\mathrm{eff}} = a + r_p$ to account for the plastic zone (PZ), where for plane stress the plastic zone size is approximated by $r_p = \\dfrac{1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\dfrac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2$, with $\\sigma_Y$ the uniaxial yield stress.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. A rigorous solution will now be provided.\n\nThe problem is addressed in the requested sequence.\n\n1) Derivation of the closed-form expression for the corrected `$K_I$`.\n\nWe begin with the three fundamental relations provided for the corrected system:\n$$\nK_I = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\na_{\\mathrm{eff}} = a + r_p \\quad (2)\n$$\n$$\nr_p = \\dfrac{1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\dfrac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2 \\quad (3)\n$$\nThe objective is to find an expression for `$K_I$` that depends only on the given parameters `$\\sigma$`, `$a$`, and `$\\sigma_Y$`. This is accomplished by algebraic elimination of `$a_{\\mathrm{eff}}$` and `$r_p$`.\n\nFirst, substitute equation `$(3)$` into equation `$(2)$` to express `$a_{\\mathrm{eff}}$` in terms of `$K_I$`:\n$$\na_{\\mathrm{eff}} = a + \\dfrac{1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\dfrac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2\n$$\nNext, substitute this expression for `$a_{\\mathrm{eff}}$` into equation `$(1)$`:\n$$\nK_I = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi \\left[ a + \\dfrac{1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\dfrac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2 \\right]}\n$$\nThis equation is a self-consistency relation for `$K_I$`. We must now solve it for `$K_I$`. To eliminate the square root, we square both sides of the equation:\n$$\nK_I^2 = \\sigma^2 \\left[ \\pi \\left( a + \\dfrac{1}{2\\pi} \\dfrac{K_I^2}{\\sigma_Y^2} \\right) \\right]\n$$\nDistributing the terms on the right-hand side gives:\n$$\nK_I^2 = \\sigma^2 \\pi a + \\sigma^2 \\pi \\left( \\dfrac{1}{2\\pi} \\dfrac{K_I^2}{\\sigma_Y^2} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nK_I^2 = \\sigma^2 \\pi a + \\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2} K_I^2\n$$\nThis is a linear equation for `$K_I^2$`. We collect the terms involving `$K_I^2$` on one side:\n$$\nK_I^2 - \\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2} K_I^2 = \\sigma^2 \\pi a\n$$\n$$\nK_I^2 \\left( 1 - \\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2} \\right) = \\sigma^2 \\pi a\n$$\nIsolating `$K_I^2$` yields:\n$$\nK_I^2 = \\dfrac{\\sigma^2 \\pi a}{1 - \\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2}}\n$$\nTaking the square root gives the final closed-form expression for `$K_I$`. Since the stress intensity factor is physically a positive quantity, we take the positive root:\n$$\nK_I = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\sigma^2 \\pi a}{1 - \\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2}}}\n$$\nThis can be rewritten by recognizing that the uncorrected LEFM SIF is `$K_{I,LEFM} = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a}$`:\n$$\nK_I = K_{I,LEFM} \\left( 1 - \\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2} \\right)^{-1/2}\n$$\nThis solution is physically meaningful only when the term in the denominator is positive, which implies `$1 - \\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2} > 0$`, or `$\\sigma < \\sqrt{2} \\sigma_Y$`. This condition defines the limit of applicability of this simplified plasticity correction model.\n\n2) Formulation of the fixed-point iteration.\n\nA fixed-point iteration scheme seeks a solution to an equation of the form `$x = g(x)$` by iterating `$x_{k+1} = g(x_k)$`. We formulate such a scheme for `$K_I$`. As specified, we use the self-consistency relation derived above:\n$$\nK_I = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi \\left( a + \\dfrac{1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\dfrac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2 \\right)}\n$$\nLet `$K_I^{(k)}$` be the estimate of the SIF at iteration `$k$`. The next estimate, `$K_I^{(k+1)}$`, is computed using the mapping function `$g(K_I^{(k)})$`. The iteration is defined as `$K_I^{(k+1)} = g(K_I^{(k)})$`, where the function `$g(K)$` is:\n$$\ng(K) = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a + \\dfrac{K^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the initial guess, which is the LEFM solution without plasticity correction:\n$$\nK_I^{(0)} = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a}\n$$\nThe iteration proceeds as `$K_I^{(1)} = g(K_I^{(0)})$`, `$K_I^{(2)} = g(K_I^{(1)})$`, and so on, until convergence is achieved. The fixed point of this iteration, `$K_I = g(K_I)$`, is precisely the equation from which the closed-form solution was derived, ensuring that the iteration converges to the correct value, provided it converges at all. Convergence is guaranteed if the magnitude of the derivative `$|g'(K)|$` is less than `$1$` in the vicinity of the solution. The derivative is `$g'(K) = \\dfrac{\\sigma^2 K}{2 \\sigma_Y^2 g(K)}$`. At the fixed point `$K^*$`, where `$g(K^*) = K^*$`, this simplifies to `$g'(K^*) = \\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2}$`. Thus, convergence is guaranteed if `$\\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2} < 1$`, which is the same condition `$\\sigma < \\sqrt{2} \\sigma_Y$` derived previously.\n\n3) & 4) Numerical Solver Implementation and Computation.\n\nA numerical solver based on the fixed-point iteration formulated above is implemented to compute the corrected `$K_I$` for the given test cases. The algorithm for each parameter set `$(\\sigma, a, \\sigma_Y)$` is as follows:\n- Initialize the iteration count `$k=0$` and the SIF `$K_I^{(0)} = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a}$`.\n- Loop for a maximum of `$10^4$` iterations:\n  - Compute the next SIF estimate: `$K_I^{(k+1)} = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a + \\frac{(K_I^{(k)})^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2}}$`.\n  - Check for convergence: if `$|K_I^{(k+1)} - K_I^{(k)}| < 10^{-12}$`, the iteration has converged. The loop is terminated, and `$K_I^{(k+1)}$` is the result.\n  - Update for the next iteration: `$K_I^{(k)} \\leftarrow K_I^{(k+1)}$`.\n- If the loop completes without convergence, the final computed value of `$K_I$` is returned.\n\nThis algorithm is implemented in Python, using the `numpy` library for mathematical constants and functions.

The problem is valid and permits a unique solution.\n\nSolution Process:\nThe problem requires finding the maximum allowable remote tensile stress, $\\sigma_{\\max}$, under a specific set of conditions. The solution is constructed from fundamental principles of fracture mechanics.\n\nFirst, the stress intensity factor, $K_Q$, for a plate with an edge crack is given by:\n$$K_Q = Y \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the remote tensile stress, $Y$ is the geometry factor, and $a_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is the effective crack length.\n\nSecond, the effective crack length, $a_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is determined using Irwin's plastic zone correction. The physical crack length, $a_{phys}$, is the sum of the initial length and its growth:\n$$a_{\\mathrm{phys}} = a_0 + \\Delta a$$\nThe correction adds the plastic zone radius, $r_p$, to the physical length. For plane strain conditions, this radius is:\n$$r_p = \\frac{1}{6\\pi} \\left( \\frac{K_Q}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2$$\nTherefore, the effective crack length is:\n$$a_{\\mathrm{eff}} = a_{\\mathrm{phys}} + r_p = (a_0 + \\Delta a) + \\frac{1}{6\\pi} \\left( \\frac{K_Q}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2$$\n\nThird, the problem imposes a validity criterion for plane strain, which limits the value of $K_Q$:\n$$K_Q \\le 0.5 \\sigma_Y \\sqrt{B}$$\nThe largest admissible stress, $\\sigma_{\\max}$, will correspond to the case where $K_Q$ reaches its maximum permitted value. We thus set the criterion to an equality:\n$$K_{Q, \\mathrm{limit}} = 0.5 \\sigma_Y \\sqrt{B}$$\n\nTo find $\\sigma_{\\max}$, we solve the system of equations. We substitute $K_{Q, \\mathrm{limit}}$ into the expression for the plastic zone radius:\n$$r_p = \\frac{1}{6\\pi} \\left( \\frac{0.5 \\sigma_Y \\sqrt{B}}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{6\\pi} (0.5 \\sqrt{B})^2 = \\frac{0.25 B}{6\\pi} = \\frac{B}{24\\pi}$$\nThis provides a direct calculation for the plastic zone radius at the validity limit.\n\nThe effective crack length at this limit is then:\n$$a_{\\mathrm{eff}} = (a_0 + \\Delta a) + \\frac{B}{24\\pi}$$\n\nNow, we use the primary equation for the stress intensity factor, setting $\\sigma = \\sigma_{\\max}$ and $K_Q = K_{Q, \\mathrm{limit}}$:\n$$K_{Q, \\mathrm{limit}} = Y \\sigma_{\\max} \\sqrt{\\pi a_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$$\nSolving for $\\sigma_{\\max}$:\n$$\\sigma_{\\max} = \\frac{K_{Q, \\mathrm{limit}}}{Y \\sqrt{\\pi a_{\\mathrm{eff}}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $K_{Q, \\mathrm{limit}}$ and $a_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ yields the final symbolic solution:\n$$\\sigma_{\\max} = \\frac{0.5 \\sigma_Y \\sqrt{B}}{Y \\sqrt{\\pi \\left( (a_0 + \\Delta a) + \\frac{B}{24\\pi} \\right)}}$$\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values, maintaining consistent units of megapascals ($\\mathrm{MPa}$) and millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}$):\n- $a_0 = 10.0~\\mathrm{mm}$\n- $\\Delta a = 0.20~\\mathrm{mm}$\n- $B = 25.0~\\mathrm{mm}$\n- $\\sigma_Y = 1200~\\mathrm{MPa}$\n- $Y = 1.12$\n\nStep 1: Calculate the limiting stress intensity factor, $K_{Q, \\mathrm{limit}}$.\n$$K_{Q, \\mathrm{limit}} = 0.5 \\times 1200~\\mathrm{MPa} \\times \\sqrt{25.0~\\mathrm{mm}} = 600 \\times 5 = 3000~\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{mm}}$$\n\nStep 2: Calculate the physical crack length, $a_{\\mathrm{phys}}$.\n$$a_{\\mathrm{phys}} = 10.0~\\mathrm{mm} + 0.20~\\mathrm{mm} = 10.2~\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nStep 3: Calculate the plastic zone radius, $r_p$.\n$$r_p = \\frac{B}{24\\pi} = \\frac{25.0~\\mathrm{mm}}{24\\pi} \\approx 0.33157~\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nStep 4: Calculate the effective crack length, $a_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n$$a_{\\mathrm{eff}} = a_{\\mathrm{phys}} + r_p = 10.2~\\mathrm{mm} + 0.33157~\\mathrm{mm} = 10.53157~\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nStep 5: Calculate the maximum stress, $\\sigma_{\\max}$.\n$$\\sigma_{\\max} = \\frac{3000~\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{mm}}}{1.12 \\sqrt{\\pi \\times 10.53157~\\mathrm{mm}}} = \\frac{3000}{1.12 \\sqrt{33.0858}}~\\mathrm{MPa}$$\n$$\\sigma_{\\max} = \\frac{3000}{1.12 \\times 5.7520}~\\mathrm{MPa} = \\frac{3000}{6.44224}~\\mathrm{MPa} \\approx 465.66~\\mathrm{MPa}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\sigma_{\\max} \\approx 466~\\mathrm{MPa}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{466}$$", "id": "2651043"}]}
