The unit normal vector to the prospective crack faces is defined by a $+90^\\circ$ rotation of the tangent, yielding $\\mathbf{n}_{\\tau}(s) = (-t_{\\tau,y}, t_{\\tau,x})$. Let its components be $\\mathbf{n}_{\\tau} = (n_{\\tau,x}, n_{\\tau,y})$.\n\nThe residual stress field $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ acts on the prospective crack faces, creating tractions that drive fracture.

The calculation thus simplifies elegantly to:\n$$\n\\psi = \\operatorname{atan2}(\\tau_{nt}, \\sigma_n)\n$$\nThis final expression forms the core of the algorithm. The procedure is to compute $\\sigma_n$ and $\\tau_{nt}$ at each specified point $(x(s), y(s))$ and then use them to find $\\psi$. All calculations must be performed in consistent units (MPa for stress, m for length), although the final calculation for $\\psi$ is dimensionless. The angle $\\psi$ is to be reported in radians.\n\nThe algorithm is applied to three test cases.\n\n**Test Case A**:\n- Parameters: $\\sigma_{0} = 100$ MPa, $\\alpha = 0.4$, $L = 0.5$ m, $W = 0.2$ m, $\\beta = 0.25$, $\\gamma = 0.5$, $R = 0.6$ m.\n- Stress field:\n  $$\n  \\sigma_{xx}(x,y) = \\sigma_{0}\\left(1 + \\alpha \\dfrac{x}{L}\\right) \\exp\\!\\left(-\\dfrac{y^{2}}{W^{2}}\\right)\n  $$\n  $$\n  \\sigma_{yy}(x,y) = \\beta \\sigma_{0} \\sin\\!\\left(\\pi \\dfrac{x}{L}\\right) \\exp\\!\\left(-\\dfrac{x^{2} + y^{2}}{R^{2}}\\right)\n  $$\n  $$\n  \\tau_{xy}(x,y) = \\gamma \\sigma_{0} \\left(\\dfrac{y}{W}\\right) \\exp\\!\\left(-\\dfrac{x^{2} + y^{2}}{R^{2}}\\right)\n  $$\n- Path: $x(s) = 0.6 s$, $y(s) = 0.05 \\sin(2\\pi s)$.\n- Derivatives: $x'(s) = 0.6$, $y'(s) = 0.1\\pi \\cos(2\\pi s)$.\n- Evaluation: $s \\in \\{0, 0.5, 1\\}$.\n\n**Test Case B**:\n- Parameters: $\\tau_{0} = 80$ MPa, $L = 0.8$ m, $W = 0.15$ m.\n- Stress field:\n  $$\n  \\sigma_{xx}(x,y) = 0, \\quad \\sigma_{yy}(x,y) = 0, \\quad \\tau_{xy}(x,y) = \\tau_{0} \\cos\\!\\left(2\\pi \\dfrac{x}{L}\\right) \\exp\\!\\left(-\\dfrac{|y|}{W}\\right)\n  $$\n- Path: $x(s) = -0.4 + 0.8 s$, $y(s) = -0.4 + 0.8 s$.\n- Derivatives: $x'(s) = 0.8$, $y'(s) = 0.8$.\n- Evaluation: $s \\in \\{0, 0.5, 1\\}$.\n\n**Test Case C**:\n- Parameters: $S_{0} = 120$ MPa, $W = 0.1$ m.\n- Stress field:\n  $$\n  \\sigma_{xx}(x,y) = S_{0} \\tanh\\!\\left(\\dfrac{y}{W}\\right), \\quad\n  \\sigma_{yy}(x,y) = 0.2 S_{0} \\cos\\!\\left(\\pi \\dfrac{y}{W}\\right), \\quad\n  \\tau_{xy}(x,y) = 0\n  $$\n- Path: $x(s) = 0$, $y(s) = -0.2 + 0.4 s$.\n- Derivatives: $x'(s) = 0$, $y'(s) = 0.4$.\n- Evaluation: $s \\in \\{0, 0.25, 1\\}$.\n\nFor each value of $s$, the coordinates $(x, y)$, tangent components $(t_{\\tau,x}, t_{\\tau,y})$, normal components $(n_{\\tau,x}, n_{\\tau,y})$, stress components $(\\sigma_{xx}, \\sigma_{yy}, \\tau_{xy})$, tractions $(\\sigma_n, \\tau_{nt})$, and finally the mode mixity angle $\\psi$ are computedsequentially.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the mode mixity angle psi for three test cases based on\n    Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics principles.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def calculate_psi(stress_func, path_func, path_deriv_func, s_val):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the mode mixity angle psi for a given point on a crack path.\n\n        Args:\n            stress_func: A function that returns the stress tensor components (s_xx, s_yy, t_xy) at a point (x, y).\n            path_func: A function that returns the coordinates (x, y) for a given parameter s.\n            path_deriv_func: A function that returns the path derivatives (dx/ds, dy/ds) for a given parameter s.\n            s_val: The path parameter value at which to perform the calculation.\n\n        Returns:\n            The mode mixity angle psi in radians.\n        \"\"\"\n        # 1.
