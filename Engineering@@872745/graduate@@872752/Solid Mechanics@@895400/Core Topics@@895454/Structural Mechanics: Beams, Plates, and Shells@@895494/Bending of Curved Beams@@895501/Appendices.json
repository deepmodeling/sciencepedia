The derivation begins with the specified kinematic assumptions, proceeds through the constitutive law and equilibrium equations, and culminates in a specific formula for the given rectangular ring cross-section.\n\nFirst, we establish the circumferential strain distribution, $\\varepsilon_\\theta(r)$, as a function of the radial coordinate $r$, measured from the center of curvature. The kinematic hypothesis states that cross-sections, which are initially plane and radial, remain plane and radial after bending. Consider two adjacent cross-sections initially separated by a small angle $d\\theta$. The initial length of a circumferential fiber at radius $r$ is $ds = r \\, d\\theta$. Upon application of a bending moment, the two cross-sections rotate relative to each other by a small angle $d\\psi$ about the neutral axis, which is located at an unknown radius $r_n$. The change in length of the fiber at radius $r$ is the relative displacement due to this rotation, which is approximately $\\delta(ds) = (r - r_n) \\, d\\psi$. The circumferential strain $\\varepsilon_\\theta$ is the change in length divided by the original length:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_\\theta(r) = \\frac{\\delta(ds)}{ds} = \\frac{(r - r_n) \\, d\\psi}{r \\, d\\theta}\n$$\nFor pure bending of a uniform beam, the relative rotation per unit initial angle, $\\omega = \\frac{d\\psi}{d\\theta}$, is a constant that depends on the applied moment and beam properties. Thus, the strain distribution takes the form:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_\\theta(r) = \\omega \\left(\\frac{r - r_n}{r}\\right) = \\omega \\left(1 - \\frac{r_n}{r}\\right)\n$$\nThis equation shows that the strain is zero at $r = r_n$ and varies hyperbolically across the cross-section, a key distinction from the linear strain distribution in straight beams.\n\nSecond, we apply the constitutive law for a linear elastic material, which is Hooke's Law. The problem states that radial stress is negligible ($\\sigma_r \\approx 0$), allowing us to consider a uniaxial stress state in the circumferential direction. The circumferential stress $\\sigma_\\theta$ is related to the strain $\\varepsilon_\\theta$ by the elastic modulus $E$:\n$$\n\\sigma_\\theta(r) = E \\, \\varepsilon_\\theta(r) = E \\, \\omega \\left(1 - \\frac{r_n}{r}\\right)\n$$\n\nThird, we enforce the equilibrium condition for pure bending. Pure bending is defined by the presence of a net bending moment with no net axial force acting on the cross-section. The condition of zero resultant circumferential force $F_\\theta$ is expressed as an integral of the stress over the cross-sectional area $A$:\n$$\nF_\\theta = \\int_A \\sigma_\\theta(r) \\, dA = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $\\sigma_\\theta(r)$:\n$$\n\\int_A E \\, \\omega \\left(1 - \\frac{r_n}{r}\\right) \\, dA = 0\n$$\nThe elastic modulus $E$ is non-zero, and the kinematic factor $\\omega$ is non-zero for any non-trivial bending deformation. Therefore, the integral itself must be zero:\n$$\n\\int_A \\left(1 - \\frac{r_n}{r}\\right) \\, dA = 0\n$$\nWe can separate this into two integrals:\n$$\n\\int_A dA - \\int_A \\frac{r_n}{r} \\, dA = 0\n$$\nThe radius of the neutral axis, $r_n$, is a constant for a given cross-section and can be factored out of the second integral. The first integral, $\\int_A dA$, is by definition the total area $A$ of the cross-section.\n$$\nA - r_n \\int_A \\frac{1}{r} \\, dA = 0\n$$\nSolving for $r_n$, we obtain the general integral identity for the neutral axis radius in a curved beam:\n$$\nr_n = \\frac{A}{\\int_A \\frac{1}{r} \\, dA}\n$$\nThis expression defines $r_n$ for a curved beam with an arbitrary cross-section under pure bending.\n\nFourth, we specialize this result to the given rectangular ring cross-section. The cross-section has a constant width $b$, an inner radius $r_i$, and an outer radius $r_o$. The area element $dA$ can be written as $dA = b \\, dr$.\nThe total area $A$ is calculated by integrating $dA$ from $r_i$ to $r_o$:\n$$\nA = \\int_{r_i}^{r_o} b \\, dr = b [r]_{r_i}^{r_o} = b(r_o - r_i)\n$$\nThe integral in the denominator is evaluated similarly:\n$$\n\\int_A \\frac{1}{r} \\, dA = \\int_{r_i}^{r_o} \\frac{1}{r} (b \\, dr) = b \\int_{r_i}^{r_o} \\frac{1}{r} \\, dr\n$$\nEvaluating this integral yields:\n$$\nb \\left[\\ln(r)\\right]_{r_i}^{r_o} = b (\\ln(r_o) - \\ln(r_i)) = b \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_o}{r_i}\\right)\n$$\nHere, we use the natural logarithm $\\ln$, and because the problem defines $r_o > r_i$, which are radii and thus positive, the argument of the logarithm is greater than $1$.\n\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for $A$ and $\\int_A (1/r) \\, dA$ back into the general formula for $r_n$:\n$$\nr_n = \\frac{b(r_o - r_i)}{b \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_o}{r_i}\\right)}\n$$\nThe constant width $b$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, as does the elastic modulus $E$ earlier in the derivation.

The primary assumption of the Winkler-Bach theory is that plane cross-sections remain plane and rotate about the neutral axis. This leads to a circumferential strain $\\epsilon_\\theta$ that varies hyperbolically with the radius $r$ from the center of curvature.\nAssuming linear elasticity, the hoop stress $\\sigma_\\theta$ is proportional to the strain, $\\sigma_\\theta = E \\epsilon_\\theta$. The stress distribution has the form:\n$$ \\sigma_\\theta(r) = E K \\left( 1 - \\frac{r_n}{r} \\right) $$\nwhere $K$ is a constant related to the change in curvature and $r_n$ is the radius of the neutral axis, where stress and strain are zero.\n\nTo find $r_n$, we apply the equilibrium condition that for pure bending, there is no net axial force ($N=0$) on the cross-section:\n$$ N = \\int_A \\sigma_\\theta dA = \\int_{r_i}^{r_o} \\sigma_\\theta(r) (b dr) = 0 $$\n$$ \\int_{r_i}^{r_o} E K \\left( 1 - \\frac{r_n}{r} \\right) b dr = E K b \\left[ r - r_n \\ln r \\right]_{r_i}^{r_o} = 0 $$\n$$ (r_o - r_i) - r_n (\\ln r_o - \\ln r_i) = 0 $$\nThis gives the location of the neutral axis:\n$$ r_n = \\frac{r_o - r_i}{\\ln(r_o/r_i)} $$\nThe centroidal radius is $\\bar{r} = (r_i+r_o)/2$. The neutral axis $r_n$ is always closer to the center of curvature than the centroidal axis $\\bar{r}$.\n\nTo find the constant $EK$, we use the second equilibrium condition: the internal bending moment must equal the externally applied moment $M$. The moment is taken about the centroidal axis, at radius $\\bar{r}$, and defined such that a positive value causes tension at the inner fiber:\n$$ M = \\int_A \\sigma_\\theta (\\bar{r} - r) dA $$\nSubstituting $\\sigma_\\theta(r) = E K (1 - r_n/r)$ and noting $\\int \\sigma_\\theta dA=0$, this becomes $M = -\\int_A r \\sigma_\\theta dA$.\nThe integral evaluates to $M = -E K A (\\bar{r}-r_n)$.

This is also intuitive, as increasing curvature exacerbates the stress concentration.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A.** States $\\sigma_i \\approx 750$ MPa, $n1$, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{res}}$ reduces mean stress but not alternating stress, $n'$ becomes $\\approx 1$, outward shift reduces $\\sigma_i$, inward shift increases $\\sigma_i$. All these statements are confirmed by our derivation. **Correct.**\n\n**B.** States $\\sigma_i \\approx 625$ MPa (straight beam value), curvature is negligible. This is false; $\\sigma_i \\approx 750$ MPa. States baseline $n>1$. This is false; $n  1$. States shot peening reduces alternating stress. This is false; it reduces mean stress. States outward shift increases stress. This is false; it decreases stress. **Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** States $\\sigma_i \\approx 750$ MPa (correct), but claims adding $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{res}}$ does not change the safety factor. This is false; $n$ increases from $\\approx 0.76$ to $\\approx 0.99$. Claims outward shift has no effect on stress. This is false; it reduces the stress. **Incorrect.**\n\n**D.** States the outer surface always controls fatigue. This is false; for this loading, the stress magnitude is higher at the inner surface ($|750 \\text{ MPa}| > |-533 \\text{ MPa}|$). States the inner surface is in compression. This contradicts the problem statement. States compressive residual stress is harmful. This is false for the given tensile mean stress. States inward shift decreases stress. This is false; it increases stress. **Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis, only statement A is consistent with the derived results.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2617694"}]}
