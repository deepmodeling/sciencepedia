We may proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe first task is to derive the transverse shear stress distribution, $\\tau(y)$, for a rectangular cross-section. The governing relation for transverse shear stress in a beam is the Jourawski shear stress formula:\n$$ \\tau(y) = \\frac{V Q(y)}{I b(y)} $$\nwhere $V$ is the transverse shear resultant, $I$ is the second moment of area of the entire cross-section about the neutral axis, $b(y)$ is the width of the cross-section at vertical position $y$, and $Q(y)$ is the first moment of area of the portion of the cross-section above $y$ (or below $y$), with respect to the neutral axis.\n\nFor the given rectangular cross-section of constant width $b$ and total depth $h$, the neutral axis is at $y=0$. The depth spans the interval $y \\in [-h/2, h/2]$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the second moment of area, $I$, for the rectangular cross-section about its centroidal axis ($y=0$):\n$$ I = \\int_{A} y^2 dA = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} y^2 (b \\, dy) = b \\left[ \\frac{y^3}{3} \\right]_{-h/2}^{h/2} = b \\left( \\frac{(h/2)^3}{3} - \\frac{(-h/2)^3}{3} \\right) = b \\left( \\frac{h^3}{24} + \\frac{h^3}{24} \\right) = \\frac{bh^3}{12} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the first moment of area, $Q(y)$. This is the first moment of the area $A'$ located between the coordinate $y$ and the top edge of the beam at $y=h/2$.\n$$ Q(y) = \\int_{A'} y' dA' = \\int_{y}^{h/2} y' (b \\, dy') = b \\left[ \\frac{(y')^2}{2} \\right]_{y}^{h/2} = \\frac{b}{2} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2 - y^2 \\right] = \\frac{b}{2} \\left( \\frac{h^2}{4} - y^2 \\right) $$\n\nThe width $b(y)$ is constant for all $y$, so $b(y)=b$.

The approach must be based on a variational or inequality-based argument. The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, representing a standard idealization in the mechanics of composite structures. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe analysis is based on the Principle of Minimum Complementary Energy. This principle of linear elasticity states that among all statically admissible stress fields—those satisfying the equations of equilibrium and the prescribed traction boundary conditions—the physically realized stress field is the one that minimizes the total complementary strain energy of the elastic body.\n\nFirst, we establish the set of all statically admissible shear stress distributions, $\\tau(z)$, in the core. The core has a rectangular cross-section of width $b$ and thickness $c$. The coordinate $z$ spans the thickness of the core, which we can set from $z = -c/2$ to $z = c/2$. The primary condition for a stress field to be statically admissible is that it must satisfy equilibrium. For the transverse shear stress, this means the integral of the stress over the cross-sectional area of the core must equal the total internal transverse shear force, $V$.\n\nThe equilibrium equation is:\n$$\n\\int_{-c/2}^{c/2} \\tau(z) \\, b \\, dz = V\n$$\nAny function $\\tau(z)$ that satisfies this integral equation is a statically admissible shear stress distribution.\n\nNext, we formulate the complementary strain energy stored in the core per unit length of the beam.
