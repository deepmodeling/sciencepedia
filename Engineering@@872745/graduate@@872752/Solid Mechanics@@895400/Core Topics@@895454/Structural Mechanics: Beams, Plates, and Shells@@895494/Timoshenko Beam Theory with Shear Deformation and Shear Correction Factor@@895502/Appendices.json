Let $x$ be the coordinate along the beam's axis, from $x=0$ to $x=L$. Let the transverse displacement $w(x)$ be positive in the downward direction. The concentrated load $P$ is also positive downward. The rotation of the cross-section, $\\phi(x)$, is positive counter-clockwise (CCW). The internal shear force, $V(x)$, is positive when acting upward on a positive face (a face whose outward normal points in the positive $x$ direction). The internal bending moment, $M(x)$, is positive for a \"smiling\" shape (causing tension in the lower fibers).\n\nThe governing equations are:\n1.  Equilibrium:\n    $$ \\frac{dV}{dx} = -q(x) $$\n    $$ \\frac{dM}{dx} = V(x) $$\n    where $q(x)$ is the distributed load, which for a concentrated load $P$ at $x=L/2$ is $q(x) = P\\delta(x-L/2)$.\n\n2.  Constitutive Relations:\n    $$ M(x) = EI \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} $$\n    $$ V(x) = \\kappa G A \\gamma(x) $$\n    where $E$ is Young's modulus, $I$ is the second moment of area, $G$ is the shear modulus, $A$ is the cross-sectional area, $\\kappa$ is the shear correction factor, and $\\gamma(x)$ is the engineering shear strain.\n\n3.  Kinematic Relation:\n    The problem statement provides the relation between the total slope of the beam $w'(x)$, the cross-section rotation $\\phi(x)$, and the shear strain $\\gamma(x)$ as:\n    $$ \\frac{dw}{dx} = \\phi(x) + \\gamma(x) $$\n    This can be rearranged using the constitutive law for shear:\n    $$ \\frac{dw}{dx} = \\phi(x) + \\frac{V(x)}{\\kappa G A} $$\n\nFirst, we determine the internal forces $V(x)$ and $M(x)$ from static equilibrium. For a simply supported beam with a central load $P$, the vertical reactions at the supports $x=0$ and $x=L$ are equal by symmetry: $R_0 = R_L = P/2$ (upward).\nUsing our sign convention (V is positive up), the shear force is:\n-   For $0 \\le x < L/2$: $V(x) = P/2$.\n-   For $L/2 < x \\le L$: $V(x) = P/2 - P = -P/2$.\n\nThe bending moment $M(x)$ is found by integrating the shear force, $M(x) = \\int V(x) dx$.\n-   For $0 \\le x \\le L/2$: $M(x) = \\int (P/2) dx = \\frac{P}{2}x + C_1$. The boundary condition for a simple support is $M(0)=0$, which gives $C_1=0$. Thus, $M(x) = \\frac{P}{2}x$.\n-   For $L/2 \\le x \\le L$: $M(x) = \\int (-P/2) dx = -\\frac{P}{2}x + C_2$. The boundary condition $M(L)=0$ gives $-\\frac{PL}{2} + C_2 = 0$, so $C_2 = \\frac{PL}{2}$. Thus, $M(x) = \\frac{P}{2}(L-x)$.\n\nNext, we derive the cross-section rotation $\\phi(x)$ using $d\\phi/dx = M(x)/(EI)$.\n-   For $0 \\le x \\le L/2$:\n    $$ \\frac{d\\phi_1}{dx} = \\frac{Px}{2EI} $$\n    $$ \\phi_1(x) = \\int \\frac{Px}{2EI} dx = \\frac{Px^2}{4EI} + C_3 $$\n-   For $L/2 \\le x \\le L$:\n    $$ \\frac{d\\phi_2}{dx} = \\frac{P(L-x)}{2EI} $$\n    $$ \\phi_2(x) = \\int \\frac{P(L-x)}{2EI} dx = \\frac{P}{2EI}\\left(Lx - \\frac{x^2}{2}\\right) + C_4 $$\nDue to symmetry of the problem, the cross-section rotation at mid-span must be zero, $\\phi(L/2)=0$. Applying this to $\\phi_1(x)$:\n$$ \\phi_1(L/2) = \\frac{P(L/2)^2}{4EI} + C_3 = 0 \\implies \\frac{PL^2}{16EI} + C_3 = 0 \\implies C_3 = -\\frac{PL^2}{16EI} $$\nSo, for $0 \\le x \\le L/2$:\n$$ \\phi_1(x) = \\frac{Px^2}{4EI} - \\frac{PL^2}{16EI} = \\frac{P}{16EI}(4x^2 - L^2) $$\nThe continuity of $\\phi$ at $x=L/2$ implies $\\phi_2(L/2)=0$, which can be used to find $C_4$ for the second interval if needed, resulting in an expression for $\\phi_2(x)$ symmetric to $\\phi_1(x)$ about $x=L/2$.\n\nNow, we derive the transverse deflection $w(x)$ using $dw/dx = \\phi(x) + V(x)/(\\kappa G A)$.\n-   For $0 \\le x \\le L/2$: $V(x)=P/2$.\n    $$ \\frac{dw_1}{dx} = \\phi_1(x) + \\frac{P}{2\\kappa G A} = \\left(\\frac{Px^2}{4EI} - \\frac{PL^2}{16EI}\\right) + \\frac{P}{2\\kappa G A} $$\n    Integrating with respect to $x$:\n    $$ w_1(x) = \\frac{Px^3}{12EI} - \\frac{PL^2x}{16EI} + \\frac{Px}{2\\kappa G A} + C_5 $$\n    The boundary condition for a simple support is $w(0)=0$, which gives $C_5=0$.\n    So, for $0 \\le x \\le L/2$:\n    $$ w_1(x) = \\frac{Px^3}{12EI} - \\frac{PL^2x}{16EI} + \\frac{Px}{2\\kappa G A} $$\n-   A similar procedure for $L/2 \\le x \\le L$ using $\\phi_2(x)$, $V_2(x)=-P/2$, and the remaining boundary and continuity conditions ($w_1(L/2)=w_2(L/2)$ and $w_2(L)=0$) yields the deflection for the right half of the beam. We have now found the closed-form expressions for $w(x)$ and $\\phi(x)$.\n\nThe final part of the problem asks to decompose the end slope $w'(0)$ into bending and shear contributions based on the relation $w'(x) = \\phi(x) + \\gamma(x)$ and to find the shear contribution $\\gamma(0)$.\nThe term $\\phi(x)$ represents the rotation of the cross-section, which is associated with bending deformation. The term $\\gamma(x)$ is the shear strain, which is the contribution to the slope from shear deformation.\nThe problem explicitly asks for the value of $\\gamma(0)$.\nFrom the constitutive relation for shear, we have:\n$$ \\gamma(x) = \\frac{V(x)}{\\kappa G A} $$\nWe must evaluate this expression at $x=0$.\nFor the interval $0 \\le x < L/2$, the shear force is constant and equal to $V(x) = P/2$.\nTherefore, the shear strain at the support $x=0$ is:\n$$ \\gamma(0) = \\frac{V(0)}{\\kappa G A} = \\frac{P/2}{\\kappa G A} = \\frac{P}{2\\kappa G A} $$\nThis expression represents the part of the end slope at $x=0$ that is due solely to shear deformation.

The formula for one-point integration over the element is $\\int_0^L f(x)dx \\approx f(x=L/2) \\cdot L$, which corresponds to evaluating the integrand at $\\xi=0$.\nAt $\\xi=0$, the shape functions are $N_1(0) = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $N_2(0) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe shear strain matrix at the integration point is $\\mathbf{B}_s(0) = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{1}{L} & -\\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{L} & -\\frac{1}{2} \\end{bmatrix}$.\nThe shear stiffness matrix is thus:\n$$ \\mathbf{K}_s \\approx \\kappa GA L ((\\mathbf{B}_s(0))^T \\mathbf{B}_s(0)) = \\kappa GA L \\begin{pmatrix} -1/L \\\\ -1/2 \\\\ 1/L \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/L & -1/2 & 1/L & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{K}_s = \\kappa GA L \\begin{pmatrix} 1/L^2 & 1/(2L) & -1/L^2 & 1/(2L) \\\\ 1/(2L) & 1/4 & -1/(2L) & 1/4 \\\\ -1/L^2 & -1/(2L) & 1/L^2 & -1/(2L) \\\\ 1/(2L) & 1/4 & -1/(2L) & 1/4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\kappa GA}{L} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & L/2 & -1 & L/2 \\\\ L/2 & L^2/4 & -L/2 & L^2/4 \\\\ -1 & -L/2 & 1 & -L/2 \\\\ L/2 & L^2/4 & -L/2 & L^2/4 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe total element stiffness matrix is $\\mathbf{K}_e = \\mathbf{K}_b + \\mathbf{K}_s$:\n$$ \\mathbf{K}_e = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\kappa G A}{L} & \\frac{\\kappa G A}{2} & -\\frac{\\kappa G A}{L} & \\frac{\\kappa G A}{2} \\\\ \\frac{\\kappa G A}{2} & \\frac{EI}{L} + \\frac{\\kappa G A L}{4} & -\\frac{\\kappa G A}{2} & -\\frac{EI}{L} + \\frac{\\kappa G A L}{4} \\\\ -\\frac{\\kappa G A}{L} & -\\frac{\\kappa G A}{2} & \\frac{\\kappa G A}{L} & -\\frac{\\kappa G A}{2} \\\\ \\frac{\\kappa G A}{2} & -\\frac{EI}{L} + \\frac{\\kappa G A L}{4} & -\\frac{\\kappa G A}{2} & \\frac{EI}{L} + \\frac{\\kappa G A L}{4} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n**Part 2: Cantilever Beam Solution**\n\nFor a cantilever beam clamped at $x=0$ (node $1$) and free at $x=L$ (node $2$), the boundary conditions are $w_1=0$ and $\\phi_1=0$. A concentrated transverse force $P$ is applied at the tip, so the nodal force vector components are $F_{w2}=P$ and $M_2=0$.\nThe system of equations $\\mathbf{K}_e \\mathbf{d}_e = \\mathbf{F}_e$ is reduced by applying these conditions.
