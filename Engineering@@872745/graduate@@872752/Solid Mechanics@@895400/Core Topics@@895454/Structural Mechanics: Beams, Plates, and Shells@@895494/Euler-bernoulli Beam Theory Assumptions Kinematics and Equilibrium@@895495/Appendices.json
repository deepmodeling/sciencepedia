The beam is slender and undergoes small deflections. Assume the Euler–Bernoulli (classical) beam hypotheses: plane cross-sections remain plane and normal to the deflected centerline, and transverse normals do not experience stretching. Let the geometric centroid of each cross-section coincide with the neutral axis.\n\nThree alternative cross-sections are considered, each bending about its strong (symmetric) centroidal axis in response to the same loading:\n- Rectangular section with width $b$ and height $h$.\n- Circular section with diameter $d$.\n- Doubly symmetric I-section with overall height $h_{I}$, flange width $b_{f}$, flange thickness $t_{f}$, and web thickness $t_{w}$, where $0t_{f}\\tfrac{1}{2}h_{I}$ and $0t_{w}b_{f}$.\n\nTasks:\n1) Starting only from the stated kinematic assumptions, linear elasticity, and force/moment equilibrium of a differential beam element, derive how the normal stress distribution across a cross-section depends on the bending moment and the second moment of area.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for derivation. No flaws are identified. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe analysis is structured into the three main tasks presented in the problem statement. We use a coordinate system where $x$ is the longitudinal axis of the beam, $y$ is the transverse coordinate in the plane of bending, measured positive upwards from the neutral axis, and $z$ is the coordinate along the width of the cross-section.\n\n1) Normal Stress Distribution, Bending Moment, and Scaling\n\nThe derivation begins from the kinematic assumption of Euler-Bernoulli beam theory: plane cross-sections, initially normal to the beam's longitudinal axis, remain plane and normal to the deflected neutral axis. Let $w(x)$ be the transverse deflection of the neutral axis. For small deflections, the rotation of a cross-section at position $x$ is given by the angle $\\theta(x) \\approx \\frac{dw}{dx}$.\n\nA point at a vertical distance $y$ from the neutral axis experiences a longitudinal displacement $u_x$ due to this rotation. This displacement is given by $u_x(x,y) = -y \\theta(x) = -y \\frac{dw}{dx}$. The negative sign indicates that for a positive rotation (counter-clockwise) and positive $y$ (above the neutral axis), the displacement is in the negative $x$-direction, resulting in compression.\n\nThe longitudinal normal strain $\\epsilon_{xx}$ is the rate of change of this displacement with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{xx}(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} = -y \\frac{d^2w}{dx^2}\n$$\nThe quantity $\\kappa(x) = \\frac{d^2w}{dx^2}$ is the curvature of the neutral axis. Thus, the strain distribution is linear across the cross-section:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{xx}(x,y) = -y \\kappa(x)\n$$\nAssuming the beam material is homogeneous and linearly elastic, it obeys Hooke's Law. The longitudinal normal stress $\\sigma_{xx}$ is related to the strain by the Young's modulus $E$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx}(x,y) = E \\epsilon_{xx}(x,y) = -E \\kappa(x) y\n$$\nThis shows the stress is also distributed linearly across the section height.\n\nThe net axial force on the cross-section must be zero, as the beam is subjected only to transverse loading. The position of the neutral axis is defined by this condition.\n$$\nF_x = \\int_A \\sigma_{xx} dA = \\int_A (-E \\kappa y) dA = -E \\kappa \\int_A y dA = 0\n$$\nSince for a bent beam $E \\neq 0$ and $\\kappa \\neq 0$, it must be that $\\int_A y dA = 0$. This integral is the first moment of area. The condition that it is zero confirms that the origin of the $y$-axis, the neutral axis, must pass through the centroid of the cross-section. The problem statement gives this as a premise.\n\nThe bending moment $M(x)$ at a cross-section is the resultant moment of the normal stresses about the neutral axis (the $z$-axis). With a sign convention where a positive moment induces positive curvature (tension on the bottom, compression on top), we have:\n$$\nM(x) = - \\int_A y \\sigma_{xx} dA\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\sigma_{xx}$:\n$$\nM(x) = - \\int_A y (-E \\kappa y) dA = E \\kappa \\int_A y^2 dA\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_A y^2 dA$ is the second moment of area of the cross-section about the neutral axis, denoted by $I$.\n$$\nI = \\int_A y^2 dA\n$$\nThus, the relationship between bending moment and curvature is $M(x) = E I \\kappa(x)$.\n\nTo find the stress distribution in terms of the bending moment, we substitute $\\kappa = \\frac{M}{EI}$ back into the stress equation:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx}(x,y) = -E \\left(\\frac{M}{EI}\\right) y = -\\frac{M(x) y}{I}\n$$\nThis is the well-known flexure formula. The maximum magnitude of the normal stress, the extreme-fiber stress $\\sigma_{max}$, occurs at the point farthest from the neutral axis, where $|y|$ is maximum. Let this distance be $c = y_{max}$.\n$$\n\\sigma_{max} = \\frac{M c}{I}\n$$\nFor a fixed bending moment $M$, the extreme-fiber stress $\\sigma_{max}$ is inversely proportional to the second moment of area $I$, i.e., $\\sigma_{max} \\propto \\frac{1}{I}$. It is directly proportional to the distance $c$ from the neutral axis. The section depth, let's call it $h_{depth}$, is related to $c$ (for symmetric sections, $c = h_{depth}/2$). Therefore, the extreme-fiber stress scales with the ratio of section depth to the second moment of area, $\\sigma_{max} \\propto \\frac{c}{I}$.\n\n2) Governing Differential Equation for Deflection\n\nFrom the previous derivation, the moment-curvature relation is $M(x) = E I \\frac{d^2w}{dx^2}$. For a prismatic beam, the flexural rigidity $EI$ is constant.\n\nNext, we consider the equilibrium of a differential element of the beam of length $dx$. Let the distributed transverse load be $q(x)$ (positive upwards) and the internal shear force be $V(x)$. Summing forces in the vertical direction gives $\\frac{dV}{dx} = q(x)$. Summing moments gives $\\frac{dM}{dx} = V(x)$. Combining these, we obtain the relation between the bending moment and the applied load:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2M}{dx^2} = q(x)\n$$\nSubstituting the moment-curvature relationship into this equilibrium equation yields the governing differential equation for the transverse deflection $w(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\\left(E I \\frac{d^2w}{dx^2}\\right) = q(x)\n$$\nSince $E$ and $I$ are constant, this simplifies to:\n$$\nE I \\frac{d^4w}{dx^4} = q(x)\n$$\nFor a simply supported beam of length $L$ under a uniform load $q(x)=q$, where $q$ is a constant, we must solve this equation with boundary conditions $w(0)=0$, $w(L)=0$, $M(0)=0$, and $M(L)=0$. Since $M = EIw''$, the moment conditions are $w''(0)=0$ and $w''(L)=0$. Assuming the load $q$ acts downwards, we set the right-hand side to $-q$ if $w$ is positive upwards.\n$$\nE I \\frac{d^4w}{dx^4} = -q\n$$\nIntegrating four times and applying the boundary conditions yields the deflection curve:\n$$\nw(x) = -\\frac{q}{24EI} (x^4 - 2Lx^3 + L^3x)\n$$\nThe midspan deflection occurs at $x=L/2$:\n$$\nw\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{q}{24EI} \\left(\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right)^4 - 2L\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right)^3 + L^3\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right)\\right) = -\\frac{5qL^4}{384EI}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the midspan deflection is $|w_{mid}| = \\frac{5qL^4}{384EI}$. This explicitly shows that the deflection is inversely proportional to the Young's modulus $E$ and inversely proportional to the second moment of area $I$.\n\n3) Calculation of Second Moments of Area\n\nWe compute the centroidal second moment of area $I$ about the strong axis from first principles for each specified cross-section.\n\n- **Rectangular section:** Width $b$, height $h$. The centroid is at the geometric center. We integrate over the area by taking horizontal strips of width $b$ and infinitesimal height $dy$.\n$$\nI_{rect} = \\int_A y^2 dA = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} y^2 (b \\, dy) = b \\left[ \\frac{y^3}{3} \\right]_{-h/2}^{h/2} = \\frac{b}{3} \\left( \\frac{h^3}{8} - \\left(-\\frac{h^3}{8}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{bh^3}{12}\n$$\n\n- **Circular section:** Diameter $d$, radius $R=d/2$. It is convenient to use polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ where $y = r \\sin\\theta$ and $dA = r dr d\\theta$.\n$$\nI_{circ} = \\int_A y^2 dA = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^R (r \\sin\\theta)^2 (r dr d\\theta) = \\left(\\int_0^R r^3 dr\\right) \\left(\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sin^2\\theta d\\theta\\right)\n$$\nThe integrals evaluate to:\n$$\n\\int_0^R r^3 dr = \\frac{R^4}{4}\n\\qquad\n\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sin^2\\theta d\\theta = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{1-\\cos(2\\theta)}{2} d\\theta = \\pi\n$$\nSo, $I_{circ} = \\frac{\\pi R^4}{4}$. In terms of diameter $d$, this is:\n$$\nI_{circ} = \\frac{\\pi (d/2)^4}{4} = \\frac{\\pi d^4}{64}\n$$\n\n- **Doubly symmetric I-section:** Height $h_I$, flange width $b_f$, flange thickness $t_f$, web thickness $t_w$. We treat the section as an assembly of a central web and two flanges and use superposition along with the parallel-axis theorem, $I = I_c + A d^2$, where $I_c$ is the second moment of area about the part's own centroidal axis, $A$ is the area of the part, and $d$ is the distance between the part's centroidal axis and the global centroidal axis.\n\nThe web is a rectangle of width $t_w$ and height $h_w = h_I - 2t_f$. Its centroid coincides with the global centroid of the I-section, so the parallel-axis theorem is not needed for the web.\n$$\nI_{web} = \\frac{t_w h_w^3}{12} = \\frac{t_w (h_I - 2t_f)^3}{12}\n$$\nEach flange is a rectangle of width $b_f$ and height $t_f$. The second moment of area of one flange about its own centroidal axis is $I_{flange, c} = \\frac{b_f t_f^3}{12}$. The centroid of each flange is at a distance $d = \\frac{h_I}{2} - \\frac{t_f}{2} = \\frac{h_I - t_f}{2}$ from the global centroidal axis. The area of a flange is $A_f = b_f t_f$.\nBy the parallel-axis theorem, the second moment of area for one flange about the global axis is:\n$$\nI_{one\\_flange} = I_{flange, c} + A_f d^2 = \\frac{b_f t_f^3}{12} + (b_f t_f)\\left(\\frac{h_I - t_f}{2}\\right)^2\n$$\nThe total second moment of area for the I-section is the sum of the contributions from the web and the two flanges:\n$$\nI_{I-section} = I_{web} + 2 \\cdot I_{one\\_flange} = \\frac{t_w (h_I - 2t_f)^3}{12} + 2 \\left[ \\frac{b_f t_f^3}{12} + b_f t_f \\frac{(h_I - t_f)^2}{4} \\right]\n$$\n$$\nI_{I-section} = \\frac{t_w (h_I - 2t_f)^3}{12} + \\frac{b_f t_f^3}{6} + \\frac{b_f t_f (h_I-t_f)^2}{2}\n$$\nThis expression can be simplified for the final answer. An alternative method is to subtract the two void rectangular areas from a large bounding rectangle of width $b_f$ and height $h_I$. The void areas have width $\\frac{b_f-t_w}{2}$ each and height $h_I - 2t_f$. Their centroids are on the main neutral axis.\n$$\nI_{I-section} = I_{total\\_rect} - 2 \\cdot I_{void\\_rect} = \\frac{b_f h_I^3}{12} - 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\left(\\frac{b_f - t_w}{2}\\right) (h_I - 2t_f)^3}{12}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression reported below.\n\n4) Final Expression for the I-section\n\nThe fully simplified, closed-form expression for the centroidal second moment of area of the I-section is:\n$$\nI_{I-section} = \\frac{1}{12} \\left[ b_f h_I^3 - (b_f - t_w)(h_I - 2t_f)^3 \\right]\n$$\nThis expression is provided as the final answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{12} \\left( b_{f} h_{I}^{3} - (b_{f} - t_{w})(h_{I} - 2t_{f})^{3} \\right)}$$", "id": "2637250"}, {"introduction": "To truly master a theory, it is often helpful to study its purest application.

The language is objective and precise, with all necessary sign conventions explicitly defined. The problem is self-contained and free from internal contradictions or missing information. The scenario is physically realizable and serves as a fundamental case (pure bending) in beam theory. No flaws from the specified checklist are present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be developed.\n\n**Derivation of Internal Shear Force $V(x)$ and Bending Moment $M(x)$**\n\nTo determine the internal shear force $V(x)$ and bending moment $M(x)$, we will apply the equations of static equilibrium to a free-body diagram of an arbitrary segment of the beam. We consider a segment of the beam extending from an arbitrary position $x$ to the free end at $L$, where $0  x  L$.\n\nLet us establish a coordinate system where the $x$-axis aligns with the undeformed beam's neutral axis, and the $y$-axis is transverse, pointing upwards.\n\n**Free-Body Diagram (FBD) of the segment from $x$ to $L$:**\n- At the right end, $x=L$, there is an externally applied couple $M_0$. The problem states it produces a positive, sagging curvature. In our coordinate system, a sagging curvature corresponds to the beam bending upwards, which is produced by a counter-clockwise (CCW) moment. Thus, the applied moment is $+M_0$ (CCW).\n- At the left end of this segment (the cut face at position $x$), we expose the internal actions, $V(x)$ and $M(x)$. We draw them in their positive directions according to the specified sign conventions and Newton's third law of action-reaction.\n    - **Shear Force $V(x)$**: The convention is that a positive $V(x)$ acts in the $+y$ direction (upwards) on the *right* face of a cut. Our face at $x$ is a *left* face. Therefore, by action-reaction, the shear force on this left face corresponding to a positive internal shear $V(x)$ must act in the $-y$ direction (downwards).\n    - **Bending Moment $M(x)$**: The convention is that a positive $M(x)$ produces sagging curvature. For a sagging curvature, the moment on a right face is CCW, and the moment on a left face is clockwise (CW). Our face at $x$ is a left face, so a positive internal moment $M(x)$ acts in the CW direction.\n\n**Applying Equilibrium Equations to the segment $[x, L]$:**\n\n1.  **Sum of forces in the $y$-direction must be zero ($\\sum F_y = 0$):**\n    The only vertical force acting on this segment is the internal shear force at the cut.\n    $$ -V(x) = 0 $$\n    This directly yields the internal shear force:\n    $$ V(x) = 0 $$\n    This result holds for any $x$ in the interval $0  x  L$. The internal shear force is zero throughout the span because there are no applied transverse forces.\n\n2.  **Sum of moments about any point must be zero. We sum moments about the cut at position $x$ ($\\sum M_x = 0$), taking CCW as the positive direction:**\n    The forces and moments contributing to this sum are the internal moment $M(x)$ at the cut and the external moment $M_0$ at the end $x=L$.\n    The internal moment $M(x)$ is CW, so its contribution to the sum is $-M(x)$.\n    The external moment $M_0$ is CCW, so its contribution is $+M_0$.\n    The shear force $V(x)$ passes through the point $x$, so it produces no moment about $x$.\n    $$ \\sum M_x = M_0 - M(x) = 0 $$\n    Solving for the internal bending moment $M(x)$:\n    $$ M(x) = M_0 $$\n    This result shows that the internal bending moment is constant along the entire span of the beam and is equal to the applied end couple $M_0$.\n\n**Physical Implications and Relation to Euler-Bernoulli Theory**\n\nThe results $V(x)=0$ and $M(x)=M_0$ characterize a state of **pure bending**.\n\n- **Normal Stress ($\\sigma_x$)**: The normal stress due to bending is given by the flexure formula, a direct consequence of the Euler-Bernoulli kinematic assumptions:\n  $$ \\sigma_x(x,y) = -\\frac{M(x) y}{I} $$\n  Substituting $M(x) = M_0$, we get:\n  $$ \\sigma_x(y) = -\\frac{M_0 y}{I} $$\n  This equation shows that the normal stress is constant along the length of the beam ($x$-direction) but varies linearly with the distance $y$ from the neutral axis. Since $M_0  0$, for fibers above the neutral axis ($y0$), $\\sigma_x$ is negative (compression), and for fibers below the neutral axis ($y0$), $\\sigma_x$ is positive (tension). This is consistent with the definition of sagging curvature provided in the problem statement.\n\n- **Transverse Shear Stress ($\\tau_{xy}$)**: The transverse shear stress is calculated using the formula:\n  $$ \\tau_{xy}(x,y) = \\frac{V(x)Q(y)}{It(y)} $$\n  where $Q(y)$ is the first moment of area and $t(y)$ is the thickness at height $y$. Since we have rigorously shown that the internal shear force $V(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in (0, L)$, it follows directly that:\n  $$ \\tau_{xy}(x,y) = 0 $$\n  The transverse shear stress is zero everywhere in the beam (away from the end supports, where stress concentrations may exist).\n\n- **Connection to Euler-Bernoulli Assumptions**: The Euler-Bernoulli theory is founded on the assumption that transverse shear deformation is negligible. In this specific loading case, the internal shear force $V(x)$ is identically zero. This means that the shear stress $\\tau_{xy}$ is also zero. Consequently, the shear strain $\\gamma_{xy} = \\tau_{xy} / G$ is also zero (where $G$ is the shear modulus). This is a rare case where the fundamental kinematic assumption of Euler-Bernoulli theory is not an approximation but an exact reflection of the beam's state of stress and strain under the given load. The beam deforms into a circular arc, and the assumption that plane sections remain plane and normal to the deformed axis holds exactly.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0  M_0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2637273"}, {"introduction": "While the linear Euler-Bernoulli theory is a workhorse of structural analysis, its accuracy hinges on the assumption of small deflections and rotations.

Consider a free-body diagram of the beam segment from an arbitrary position $x$ to the free end at $x=L$. A vertical tip load $P$ is applied at $x=L$. For static equilibrium, the sum of moments about the cut section at $x$ must be zero.

The constraint is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{|\\kappa_{\\text{lin}}-\\kappa_{\\text{exact}}|}{|\\kappa_{\\text{lin}}|} \\le \\varepsilon\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the linearized and exact curvatures, $\\kappa_{\\text{lin}} = w''(x)$ and $\\kappa_{\\text{exact}} = \\frac{w''(x)}{(1+(w'(x))^2)^{3/2}}$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{\\left| w''(x) - \\frac{w''(x)}{(1+(w'(x))^2)^{3/2}} \\right|}{|w''(x)|} \\le \\varepsilon\n$$\nFor a non-zero bending moment, $w''(x) \\neq 0$, allowing for cancellation:\n$$\n\\left| 1 - \\frac{1}{(1+(w'(x))^2)^{3/2}} \\right| \\le \\varepsilon\n$$\nSince $(w'(x))^2 \\ge 0$, the term $(1+(w'(x))^2)^{-3/2}$ is always less than or equal to $1$. The expression inside the absolute value is therefore non-negative, and the inequality becomes:\n$$\n1 - (1+(w'(x))^2)^{-3/2} \\le \\varepsilon\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $|w'(x)|$:\n$$\n1 - \\varepsilon \\le (1+(w'(x))^2)^{-3/2}\n$$\n$$\n(1-\\varepsilon)^{-1} \\ge (1+(w'(x))^2)^{3/2}\n$$\n$$\n(1-\\varepsilon)^{-2/3} \\ge 1+(w'(x))^2\n$$\n$$\n(w'(x))^2 \\le (1-\\varepsilon)^{-2/3} - 1\n$$\nThis leads to an upper bound on the magnitude of the slope at any point $x$:\n$$\n|w'(x)| \\le \\sqrt{(1-\\varepsilon)^{-2/3} - 1}\n$$\nThis condition must be satisfied everywhere along the beam, which means it must hold for the maximum absolute slope, $\\max_{x\\in[0,L]} |w'(x)|$.\n\nFourth, we determine the maximum load $P^{\\star}$. We must first find the location and value of the maximum absolute slope from our linear solution. The slope magnitude is:\n$$\n|w'(x)| = \\frac{P}{EI} \\left( Lx - \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right)\n$$\nTo find the maximum of this function on the interval $x \\in [0,L]$, we examine its derivative: $\\frac{d}{dx}|w'(x)| = \\frac{P}{EI}(L-x)$. This derivative is non-negative for all $x \\in [0,L]$, indicating that the slope magnitude is a monotonically increasing function of $x$. The maximum slope thus occurs at the free end, $x=L$.\n$$\n\\max_{x\\in[0,L]} |w'(x)| = |w'(L)| = \\frac{P}{EI} \\left( L^2 - \\frac{L^2}{2} \\right) = \\frac{PL^2}{2EI}\n$$\nThe critical load $P^{\\star}$ is the load for which this maximum slope equals the limit derived from the error tolerance:\n$$\n\\frac{P^{\\star}L^2}{2EI} = \\sqrt{(1-\\varepsilon)^{-2/3} - 1}\n$$\nSolving for $P^{\\star}$:\n$$\nP^{\\star} = \\frac{2EI}{L^2} \\sqrt{(1-\\varepsilon)^{-2/3} - 1}\n$$\nThe second moment of area, $I$, for the rectangular cross-section is $I = \\frac{bh^3}{12}$. Substituting this into the expression for $P^{\\star}$:\n$$\nP^{\\star} = \\frac{2E\\left(\\frac{bh^3}{12}\\right)}{L^2} \\sqrt{(1-\\varepsilon)^{-2/3} - 1} = \\frac{Ebh^3}{6L^2} \\sqrt{(1-\\varepsilon)^{-2/3} - 1}\n$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n$L=0.50\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$b=50\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$h=5\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 0.005\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$E=210 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n$\\varepsilon=0.05$\n\nFirst, calculate the term under the square root:\n$$\n\\sqrt{(1-0.05)^{-2/3} - 1} = \\sqrt{(0.95)^{-2/3} - 1} \\approx \\sqrt{1.0348006 - 1} = \\sqrt{0.0348006} \\approx 0.1865385\n$$\nNext, calculate the coefficient:\n$$\n\\frac{Ebh^3}{6L^2} = \\frac{(210 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa})(0.05\\,\\mathrm{m})(0.005\\,\\mathrm{m})^3}{6(0.50\\,\\mathrm{m})^2} = \\frac{(210 \\times 10^9)(0.05)(1.25 \\times 10^{-7})}{6(0.25)} = \\frac{1312.5}{1.5} \\,\\mathrm{N} = 875\\,\\mathrm{N}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the maximum load $P^{\\star}$:\n$$\nP^{\\star} = 875\\,\\mathrm{N} \\times 0.1865385 \\approx 163.221\\,\\mathrm{N}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the maximum allowable tip load is $163\\,\\mathrm{N}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{163}\n$$", "id": "2637248"}]}
