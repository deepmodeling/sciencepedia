In the absence of any externally applied surface tractions or body forces, the equilibrium equations are fundamental.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Equations:**\n    For a spherical shell element, the principal radii of curvature are equal, $R_1 = R_2 = R$. The two non-trivial equilibrium equations for an axisymmetric state with no external loads ($p_\\phi = p_\\theta = p_n = 0$) are:\n    -   Meridional equilibrium:\n        $$ \\frac{d}{d\\phi}(N_\\phi \\sin\\phi) - N_\\theta \\cos\\phi = 0 $$\n    -   Normal equilibrium:\n        $$ \\frac{N_\\phi}{R_1} + \\frac{N_\\theta}{R_2} = p_n \\implies \\frac{N_\\phi}{R} + \\frac{N_\\theta}{R} = 0 $$\n    The normal equilibrium equation immediately yields a crucial relationship between the two membrane force resultants:\n    $$ N_\\phi = -N_\\theta $$\n    This expresses the requirement that for a curved membrane with no normal pressure, the effects of the two principal stress resultants must cancel each other out in the normal direction. Substituting this into the meridional equilibrium equation gives:\n    $$ \\frac{d}{d\\phi}(N_\\phi \\sin\\phi) - (-N_\\phi) \\cos\\phi = 0 $$\n    $$ \\frac{d N_\\phi}{d\\phi}\\sin\\phi + N_\\phi \\cos\\phi + N_\\phi \\cos\\phi = 0 $$\n    $$ \\sin\\phi \\frac{d N_\\phi}{d\\phi} + 2N_\\phi \\cos\\phi = 0 $$\n    This is a separable first-order ordinary differential equation for $N_\\phi(\\phi)$:\n    $$ \\frac{dN_\\phi}{N_\\phi} = -2\\frac{\\cos\\phi}{\\sin\\phi}d\\phi = -2\\cot\\phi \\, d\\phi $$\n    Integrating both sides yields:\n    $$ \\ln(N_\\phi) = -2\\ln(\\sin\\phi) + C_1 \\implies N_\\phi(\\phi) = \\frac{C}{\\sin^2\\phi} $$\n    where $C$ is a constant of integration. Consequently, $N_\\theta(\\phi) = -C/\\sin^2\\phi$.\n\n2.  **Regularity Condition at the Pole:**\n    The problem describes a spherical segment bounded by $\\phi = \\phi_0$, which implies it is a cap that includes the pole at $\\phi = 0$. For the physical solution to be valid, the stress resultants must remain finite everywhere within the shell, including at the pole. As $\\phi \\to 0$, the term $\\sin^2\\phi \\to 0$. To prevent $N_\\phi$ and $N_\\theta$ from becoming singular at the pole, the constant of integration $C$ must be zero.\n    $$ C=0 $$\n    Therefore, the only membrane solution that is both regular at the pole and satisfies the equilibrium equations for a spherical shell under no external load is the trivial solution:\n    $$ N_\\phi(\\phi) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad N_\\theta(\\phi) = 0 $$\n\n3.  **Kinematics, Constitutive Law, and Boundary Conditions:**\n    Let us now analyze the implications of this zero-stress state in the context of the thermal loading and boundary conditions. The linear thermoelastic constitutive relations for the membrane forces are:\n    $$ N_\\phi = \\frac{Et}{1-\\nu^2} [\\epsilon_\\phi + \\nu \\epsilon_\\theta - (1+\\nu)\\alpha\\Delta T] $$\n    $$ N_\\theta = \\frac{Et}{1-\\nu^2} [\\epsilon_\\theta + \\nu \\epsilon_\\phi - (1+\\nu)\\alpha\\Delta T] $$\n    where $\\epsilon_\\phi$ and $\\epsilon_\\theta$ are the total strains. If $N_\\phi = N_\\theta = 0$, we can solve for the strains:\n    $$ \\epsilon_\\phi + \\nu \\epsilon_\\theta = (1+\\nu)\\alpha\\Delta T $$\n    $$ \\epsilon_\\theta + \\nu \\epsilon_\\phi = (1+\\nu)\\alpha\\Delta T $$\n    Solving this system yields $\\epsilon_\\phi(1-\\nu^2) = (1+\\nu)\\alpha\\Delta T(1-\\nu)$, which simplifies to $\\epsilon_\\phi = \\alpha\\Delta T$. Similarly, $\\epsilon_\\theta = \\alpha\\Delta T$.\n    So, the zero-stress membrane state corresponds to a state of uniform strain equal to the free thermal strain:\n    $$ \\epsilon_\\phi = \\epsilon_\\theta = \\alpha\\Delta T $$\n    This is the state of free, unconstrained thermal expansion of the sphere.\n\n    The problem imposes a kinematic constraint at the edge $\\phi = \\phi_0$: \"the in-plane displacement along the edge is constrained so that the edge length does not increase\". This is a condition on the total circumferential strain at the edge, requiring it to be non-positive. For a temperature rise $\\Delta T > 0$, the free expansion would increase the edge length. The constraint means the total circumferential strain at the edge must be zero, $\\epsilon_\\theta(\\phi_0) = 0$.\n    The membrane solution yields $\\epsilon_\\theta(\\phi_0) = \\alpha\\Delta T$. This is in direct conflict with the boundary condition $\\epsilon_\\theta(\\phi_0)=0$ (assuming $\\alpha\\Delta T \\neq 0$).\n\n4.  **Interior Solution and Bending Effects:**\n    This incompatibility demonstrates that a pure membrane stress state cannot satisfy the prescribed boundary condition. In a physical shell with finite bending stiffness (which membrane theory neglects), the kinematic constraint at the edge would be enforced by a combination of membrane forces and bending moments localized near the edge. These edge effects create a \"boundary layer\" where the stress state is complex and involves bending.\n    \n    However, according to Saint-Venant's principle applied to shells, the influence of such self-equilibrating edge loads decays rapidly with distance from the boundary. The stress state in the \"interior\" of the shell, away from this boundary layer, is unaffected by the edge constraint and is correctly described by the pure membrane solution.\n    \n    The question asks for the \"spatially uniform interior membrane stress resultant $N^{\\star}$\". The membrane solution we derived, $N_\\phi = N_\\theta = 0$, is indeed spatially uniform and represents the state in the interior. A nonzero membrane stress field, such as a uniform state $N_\\phi=N_\\theta=N^{\\star} \\neq 0$, would satisfy meridional equilibrium but would violate the fundamental normal equilibrium equation $2N^{\\star}/R=0$, implying the existence of a fictitious normal pressure $p_n=2N^{\\star}/R$ that is not present. Such a solution is inconsistent with the first principles of membrane theory for a surface free of normal traction.\n\n    Therefore, the only valid conclusion under the strict application of membrane theory is that the thermal load induces no membrane stresses in the interior of the shell. The entire effect of the edge constraint is accommodated by a bending-dominated boundary layer, which is outside the scope of membrane theory.

This exercise explores this principle in the context of a cylindrical shell under torsion, a classic engineering problem.

The shell is modeled by membrane theory of shells (no bending moments or transverse shear resultants are included; only in-surface stress resultants are permitted). Let the middle-surface coordinates be $z$ along the axis and $\\theta$ circumferentially, and let the in-surface stress resultants be $N_{zz}$, $N_{\\theta\\theta}$, and $N_{z\\theta} = N_{\\theta z}$. External tractions per unit area applied to the middle surface are denoted by $p_z$, $p_\\theta$, and $p_n$ along the $z$, $\\theta$, and outward normal directions, respectively.\n\nTwo distinct loading protocols are considered, each generating a net twisting moment about the axis:\n\n- Case I (end torque as edge tractions): Equal and opposite torques $\\pm T$ are applied at the ends $z=0$ and $z=L$ via circumferential line tractions prescribed along the end edges, with the lateral surface traction-free, i.e., $p_z = p_\\theta = p_n = 0$ on $0<z<L$.\n\n- Case II (uniform circumferential surface shear): The ends at $z=0$ and $z=L$ are traction-free, but the lateral surface is subjected to a uniform circumferential shear traction $p_\\theta = \\tau_0$ (constant in $z$ and $\\theta$), with $p_z = p_n = 0$ on $0<z<L$. The magnitude $\\tau_0$ is chosen so that the total applied torque equals a given $T$.\n\nUsing only first principles of force equilibrium on the middle surface and standard kinematics and constitutive relations for an elastic membrane (plane stress with in-plane shear stiffness), decide which of the following statements are correct.\n\nA. If, in modeling, one excludes the in-plane shear resultant $N_{z\\theta}$ from the admissible membrane stress state (i.e., restricts to diagonal $N_{zz}$ and $N_{\\theta\\theta}$ only), then a circular cylindrical shell cannot carry a nonzero torque by membrane action; any imposed torque must then be equilibrated by bending and transverse shear that appear as end boundary layers in a long shell.\n\nB. In Case I, there exists a membrane solution in the interior with $N_{z\\theta}$ constant in $(z,\\theta)$ and $N_{\\theta\\theta}=0$, which carries the applied torque. If the end line tractions are chosen to match that constant $N_{z\\theta}$, no bending boundary layer is required to satisfy the end boundary conditions.\n\nC. For a circular cylinder with $p_n=0$ on the lateral surface, membrane normal equilibrium enforces $N_{\\theta\\theta}=0$ identically in the interior, independent of whether torque is present; thus, if a membrane solution under torsion exists, twisting is carried exclusively by the in-plane shear resultant $N_{z\\theta}$.\n\nD. In Case II, the membrane field equations and traction-free end conditions at $z=0$ and $z=L$ cannot be satisfied simultaneously for any $\\tau_0 \\neq 0$.

The radius is $R$.\n\nThe total torque $T$ transmitted across a cross-section at a given $z$ is calculated by integrating the moment contribution of the shear resultant $N_{z\\theta}$ around the circumference:\n$$ T(z) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} (N_{z\\theta} R) R \\, d\\theta = R^2 \\int_0^{2\\pi} N_{z\\theta}(z, \\theta) \\, d\\theta $$\n\n**Analysis of Statement C**\nThe normal equilibrium equation is $\\frac{N_{\\theta\\theta}}{R} + p_n = 0$. The problem specifies that for the interior of the shell ($0  z  L$), the normal traction $p_n=0$. Substituting this into the equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{N_{\\theta\\theta}}{R} + 0 = 0 \\implies N_{\\theta\\theta} = 0 $$\nThis result is independent of any other loads or stress resultants. It is a direct consequence of the cylindrical geometry and the absence of normal pressure. The second part of the statement claims that twisting is carried exclusively by $N_{z\\theta}$. As defined above, the torque $T$ is the integral of $R \\cdot N_{z\\theta}$ over the cross-section. The other stress resultants, $N_{zz}$ and $N_{\\theta\\theta}$, are normal forces and do not produce a net torque about the cylinder axis. Given that $N_{\\theta\\theta}=0$ for $p_n=0$, any torsional load must be equilibrated by the shear resultant $N_{z\\theta}$. Therefore, statement C is correct.\n\n**Analysis of Statement A**\nThe torque $T$ is given by $T = R^2 \\int_0^{2\\pi} N_{z\\theta} \\, d\\theta$. If the model restricts the stress state such that $N_{z\\theta}=0$ identically, then the torque that can be carried by membrane action is:\n$$ T = R^2 \\int_0^{2\\pi} (0) \\, d\\theta = 0 $$\nThus, a membrane without shear capacity cannot resist torsion. If an external torque $T \\neq 0$ is applied, the simplified membrane theory without $N_{z\\theta}$ cannot provide an equilibrium solution. In a more complete shell theory that includes bending moments and transverse shear resultants, these higher-order terms must be invoked to equilibrate the applied torque. These effects are typically significant only near the boundaries where loads are introduced, forming what are known as boundary layers. Thus, statement A is correct.\n\n**Analysis of Statement B**\nIn Case I, the lateral surface is traction-free: $p_z=p_\\theta=p_n=0$ for $0zL$.\nFrom the analysis of C, since $p_n=0$, we must have $N_{\\theta\\theta}=0$.\nThe circumferential equilibrium equation becomes $\\frac{\\partial N_{z\\theta}}{\\partial z} + p_\\theta = 0$, which simplifies to $\\frac{\\partial N_{z\\theta}}{\\partial z} = 0$. So, $N_{z\\theta}$ is a function of $\\theta$ only, $N_{z\\theta} = f(\\theta)$.\nThe axial equilibrium equation becomes $\\frac{\\partial N_{zz}}{\\partial z} + \\frac{1}{R}\\frac{\\partial N_{z\\theta}}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$, which gives $\\frac{\\partial N_{zz}}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{1}{R} f'(\\theta)$.\nLet's test the proposed solution: $N_{z\\theta} = N_0$ (a constant) and $N_{\\theta\\theta}=0$. With $N_0$ being constant, the equilibrium equations simplify to $\\frac{\\partial N_{zz}}{\\partial z}=0$ and the others are satisfied. Assuming no net axial force is applied, we can set $N_{zz}=0$. The state $N_{z\\theta}=N_0$, $N_{zz}=0$, $N_{\\theta\\theta}=0$ is a valid membrane equilibrium state. The torque carried by this state is $T = R^2 \\int_0^{2\\pi} N_0 \\, d\\theta = 2\\pi R^2 N_0$. Thus, a constant shear resultant $N_0 = T/(2\\pi R^2)$ can carry the torque $T$. This is the classic Bredt's theory solution.\nBoundary layers arise from a mismatch between the interior membrane solution and the prescribed boundary conditions. If the applied edge tractions at $z=0$ and $z=L$ are prescribed to be exactly $N_{z\\theta} = N_0 = T/(2\\pi R^2)$ and $N_{zz}=0$, then the membrane solution perfectly satisfies the boundary conditions. In this idealized case, there is no mismatch, and consequently, no need for a corrective bending boundary layer. Statement B is therefore correct.\n\n**Analysis of Statement D**\nIn Case II, we have $p_n=0$, $p_z=0$, and $p_\\theta=\\tau_0$ (constant). The ends at $z=0$ and $z=L$ are traction-free, meaning the stress resultants $N_{zz}$ and $N_{z\\theta}$ are zero at these boundaries.\nFrom $p_n=0$, we again have $N_{\\theta\\theta}=0$.\nThe circumferential equilibrium equation is $\\frac{\\partial N_{z\\theta}}{\\partial z} + \\frac{1}{R}\\frac{\\partial N_{\\theta\\theta}}{\\partial \\theta} + p_\\theta = 0$. Substituting the given values:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial N_{z\\theta}}{\\partial z} + 0 + \\tau_0 = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial N_{z\\theta}}{\\partial z} = -\\tau_0 $$\nThis implies that in the interior, the shear resultant must vary linearly with $z$. Let us integrate this equation from $z=0$ to $z=L$:\n$$ \\int_0^L \\frac{\\partial N_{z\\theta}}{\\partial z} dz = \\int_0^L (-\\tau_0) dz $$\n$$ N_{z\\theta}(L, \\theta) - N_{z\\theta}(0, \\theta) = -\\tau_0 L $$\nThe boundary conditions state that the ends are traction-free, so $N_{z\\theta}(0, \\theta)=0$ and $N_{z\\theta}(L, \\theta)=0$. Substituting these into the integrated equation gives:\n$$ 0 - 0 = -\\tau_0 L \\implies \\tau_0 L = 0 $$\nSince the length $L$ is non-zero, this requires $\\tau_0 = 0$. Therefore, if $\\tau_0 \\neq 0$, it is impossible to satisfy both the membrane equilibrium equation and the traction-free boundary conditions simultaneously. This mathematical contradiction highlights a limitation of membrane theory. In a real physical shell, which has bending stiffness, the paradox is resolved. Near the ends, bending effects become dominant, creating boundary layers where the membrane equations are not valid. These layers serve to accommodate the discrepancy between the \"interior\" solution (governed by membrane equilibrium) and the actual boundary conditions. Far from the ends, the interior solution is well approximated by the membrane equations, for which $\\partial N_{z\\theta}/\\partial z = -\\tau_0$ holds. The statement accurately describes this situation. Therefore, statement D is correct.\n\n**Analysis of Statement E**\nLet us derive the torsional stiffness using the membrane solution from Case I. The shear stress is $\\tau_{z\\theta} = N_{z\\theta}/t = T/(2\\pi R^2 t)$. The linear elastic constitutive relation is $\\gamma_{z\\theta} = \\tau_{z\\theta}/G$, where $\\gamma_{z\\theta}$ is the shear strain and $G$ is the shear modulus. So, $\\gamma_{z\\theta} = \\frac{T}{2\\pi R^2 t G}$. For pure torsion of a cylinder, the shear strain is related to the rate of twist (twist per unit length), $\\alpha = d\\phi/dz$, by the kinematic relation $\\gamma_{z\\theta} = R\\alpha$.\nEquating the two expressions for $\\gamma_{z\\theta}$:\n$$ R\\alpha = \\frac{T}{2\\pi R^2 t G} \\implies \\alpha = \\frac{T}{2\\pi R^3 t G} $$\nThe torsional rigidity is the ratio $T/\\alpha$:\n$$ \\frac{T}{\\alpha} = 2\\pi R^3 t G $$\nThis stiffness is directly proportional to the in-plane shear stiffness of the material, which is proportional to $Gt$. The bending stiffness of a shell element scales with $Et^3/(1-\\nu^2)$. The statement claims the torsional stiffness depends on bending stiffness (scaling with $t^3$). This is incorrect; it depends on membrane shear stiffness (scaling with $t$). The statement also claims membrane theory alone cannot determine the twist per unit length. This is also incorrect, as we have just derived the expression for $\\alpha = d\\phi/dz$. Statement E is therefore incorrect.\n\nIn summary, statements A, B, C, and D are correct, while statement E is incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCD}$$", "id": "2661671"}, {"introduction": "Having established *why* bending effects are critical, we now shift our focus to *how* they are quantified, particularly in the context of advanced composite materials.

We number the plies from bottom to top:\nPly $1$ ($0^{\\circ}$): from $z_0 = -2t$ to $z_1 = -t$.\nPly $2$ ($90^{\\circ}$): from $z_1 = -t$ to $z_2 = 0$.\nPly $3$ ($90^{\\circ}$): from $z_2 = 0$ to $z_3 = t$.\nPly $4$ ($0^{\\circ}$): from $z_3 = t$ to $z_4 = 2t$.\n\nWe can now compute the required bending stiffnesses $D_{11}$ and $D_{22}$.\nFor $D_{11}$:\n$$\nD_{11} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left[ (\\bar{Q}_{11})_1(z_1^3 - z_0^3) + (\\bar{Q}_{11})_2(z_2^3 - z_1^3) + (\\bar{Q}_{11})_3(z_3^3 - z_2^3) + (\\bar{Q}_{11})_4(z_4^3 - z_3^3) \\right]\n$$\nThe stiffness terms are: $(\\bar{Q}_{11})_1 = Q_{11}$, $(\\bar{Q}_{11})_2 = Q_{22}$, $(\\bar{Q}_{11})_3 = Q_{22}$, $(\\bar{Q}_{11})_4 = Q_{11}$.\nThe geometric terms are:\n$z_1^3 - z_0^3 = (-t)^3 - (-2t)^3 = -t^3 + 8t^3 = 7t^3$\n$z_2^3 - z_1^3 = 0^3 - (-t)^3 = t^3$\n$z_3^3 - z_2^3 = t^3 - 0^3 = t^3$\n$z_4^3 - z_3^3 = (2t)^3 - t^3 = 8t^3 - t^3 = 7t^3$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $D_{11}$:\n$$\nD_{11} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left[ Q_{11}(7t^3) + Q_{22}(t^3) + Q_{22}(t^3) + Q_{11}(7t^3) \\right] = \\frac{t^3}{3} (14 Q_{11} + 2 Q_{22})\n$$\nFor $D_{22}$:\n$$\nD_{22} = \\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{k=1}^{4} (\\bar{Q}_{22})_k (z_k^3 - z_{k-1}^3)\n$$\nThe stiffness terms are: $(\\bar{Q}_{22})_1 = Q_{22}$, $(\\bar{Q}_{22})_2 = Q_{11}$, $(\\bar{Q}_{22})_3 = Q_{11}$, $(\\bar{Q}_{22})_4 = Q_{22}$.\nUsing the same geometric terms:\n$$\nD_{22} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left[ Q_{22}(7t^3) + Q_{11}(t^3) + Q_{11}(t^3) + Q_{22}(7t^3) \\right] = \\frac{t^3}{3} (14 Q_{22} + 2 Q_{11})\n$$\nThe boundary-layer parameter $\\lambda$ is defined as $\\lambda = (D_{11}/D_{22})^{1/4}$. Let us form the ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{D_{11}}{D_{22}} = \\frac{\\frac{t^3}{3} (14 Q_{11} + 2 Q_{22})}{\\frac{t^3}{3} (14 Q_{22} + 2 Q_{11})} = \\frac{14 Q_{11} + 2 Q_{22}}{14 Q_{22} + 2 Q_{11}} = \\frac{7 Q_{11} + Q_{22}}{7 Q_{22} + Q_{11}}\n$$\nThis ratio is dimensionless and independent of the ply thickness $t$. Therefore, the provided value of $t = 0.125 \\,\\text{mm}$ is not required for the calculation of $\\lambda$.\n\nSubstituting the numerical values for $Q_{11}$ and $Q_{22}$:\n$$\n\\frac{D_{11}}{D_{22}} = \\frac{7 \\left(\\frac{20250}{149}\\right) + \\frac{1500}{149}}{7 \\left(\\frac{1500}{149}\\right) + \\frac{20250}{149}} = \\frac{7 \\times 20250 + 1500}{7 \\times 1500 + 20250} = \\frac{141750 + 1500}{10500 + 20250} = \\frac{143250}{30750} = \\frac{191}{41}\n$$\nThe numerical value of the ratio is approximately $4.6585$.\n\nFinally, we compute $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{D_{11}}{D_{22}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{4}} = \\left(\\frac{191}{41}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{4}}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\n\\lambda \\approx (4.6585365...)^{0.25} \\approx 1.469145...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the result is $1.469$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.469}$$", "id": "2618059"}]}
