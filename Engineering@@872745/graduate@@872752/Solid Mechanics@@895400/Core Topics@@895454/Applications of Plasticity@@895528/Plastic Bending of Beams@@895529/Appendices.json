It is a standard problem in the plastic analysis of structures. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle for the analysis of a fully plastic cross-section under pure bending (zero axial force) is derived from the equilibrium of internal forces. The material is specified as ideal elastic–perfectly plastic. In the fully plastic state, every fiber in the cross-section has yielded. This means the stress is uniform in magnitude, equal to the yield stress $\\sigma_y$, and its sign depends on whether the fiber is in tension or compression.\n\nLet the cross-sectional area in compression be $A_c$ and the area in tension be $A_t$. The stress in the compression zone is $-\\sigma_y$ and in the tension zone is $+\\sigma_y$. The plastic neutral axis (PNA) is the boundary between these two zones. The equilibrium of axial forces requires that the total force on the cross-section is zero:\n$$ \\sum F_x = \\int_A \\sigma \\, dA = 0 $$\nSubstituting the stress values for the fully plastic state:\n$$ \\int_{A_c} (-\\sigma_y) \\, dA + \\int_{A_t} (+\\sigma_y) \\, dA = 0 $$\nSince $\\sigma_y$ is a non-zero constant, it can be factored out:\n$$ -\\sigma_y \\int_{A_c} dA + \\sigma_y \\int_{A_t} dA = 0 $$\n$$ -\\sigma_y A_c + \\sigma_y A_t = 0 $$\nThis leads to the fundamental condition for the location of the plastic neutral axis:\n$$ A_c = A_t $$\nThe total area of the cross-section is $A = A_c + A_t$. Therefore, the PNA must divide the total area into two equal halves:\n$$ A_c = A_t = \\frac{A}{2} $$\nFirst, we compute the total area of the T-shaped cross-section.

The von Mises yield condition is pressure independent, hence hydrostatic stress does not affect plastic collapse. The simple plastic section method applies even with the notch.

Elevated $\\mathcal{T}$ promotes ductile damage and reduces the local flow resistance near the notch root, violating the uniform $\\sigma_{y}$ assumption of simple section plasticity.

Claim: hydrostatic stress is irrelevant and no correction is needed. Verdict: Incorrect. While the von Mises yield function is pressure independent, elevated $\\mathcal{T}$ near a notch root accelerates ductile damage, reducing the local flow resistance. This violates the uniform $\\sigma_{y}$ block assumption at collapse and leads to a measurable reduction in moment capacity, as demonstrated by a constraint-aware lower-bound construction.\n\nB.

Verdict: Correct. This method is grounded in the lower-bound theorem and a physically calibrated reduction of local flow strength due to high triaxiality; it provides a safe estimate and explicitly captures the roles of $\\rho$, constraint, and $R$.\n\nC. Proposal: treat the notch as a crack and divide $M_{p}$ by an elastic stress concentration factor $K_{t}$. Verdict: Incorrect. Linear elastic fracture mechanics pertains to crack-like defects and energy release rates; $K_{t}$ is an elastic, local stress amplifier, not a collapse load reducer for plastic limit analysis. Scaling the entire section capacity by $1/K_{t}$ lacks a basis in the lower-bound or upper-bound theorems and produces an arbitrary, overly conservative estimate.\n\nD. Proposal: use a curvature-limited failure based solely on a triaxiality-dependent fracture strain, concluding $M\\approx M_{p}$ with no meaningful effect. Verdict: Incorrect. While in elastic–perfectly plastic bending the moment–curvature relation indeed approaches $M_{p}$ rapidly, ignoring the triaxiality-induced reduction of flow resistance (damage) near the notch root misses the dominant mechanism by which constraint lowers the section capacity. The corrected lower-bound shows a finite reduction $\\Delta M\\approx 4.8\\,\\mathrm{N\\,m}$ under the given calibration.\n\nTherefore, option B gives both the correct physical explanation and a consistent, principle-based corrected estimate for the collapse moment in the presence of a finite-radius notch and elevated triaxiality.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2670320"}, {"introduction": "While analytical methods are essential for building intuition, modern structural analysis relies heavily on computational tools to handle realistic material properties and complex loading.

Ensure the algorithm converges for the given test suite and that the axial force equilibrium residual is driven to a negligible value relative to the characteristic section force scale.\n- The final code must be self-contained, not require any input, and adhere to the execution environment specified later. The only allowed external libraries are Numerical Python (NumPy) and the Python standard library.", "solution": "The problem presented is a well-posed and scientifically sound exercise in computational solid mechanics. It requires the implementation of a numerical algorithm to simulate the plastic bending of a laminated beam. The provided details regarding geometry, material behavior, loading, and the numerical method are complete, consistent, and grounded in established principles of mechanics. The problem is valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe task is to compute the bending moment $M$ in a rectangular beam section subjected to a prescribed history of curvature $\\kappa$, under the constraint of zero net axial force $N=0$. The beam is composed of layers with distinct material properties, exhibiting elastoplastic behavior with isotropic hardening. The solution requires a nested iterative approach: an outer loop increments the curvature, and an inner Newton-Raphson loop determines the section's neutral axis strain $\\varepsilon_0$ to satisfy axial equilibrium. The state of each material layer is updated using a return-mapping algorithm.\n\n**1. Kinematics and Section Discretization**\n\nWe adopt the Bernoulli-Euler hypothesis, which states that plane sections remain plane. The axial strain $\\varepsilon$ at a distance $y$ from the section's geometric centroid is linear:\n$$ \\varepsilon(y) = \\varepsilon_0 - \\kappa y $$\nHere, $\\varepsilon_0$ is the axial strain at the centroid ($y=0$) and $\\kappa$ is the prescribed curvature. The coordinate $y$ is positive towards the top surface of the beam.\n\nThe rectangular section of height $h$ and width $b$ is discretized into $N_{\\ell}$ layers of equal thickness $t = h/N_{\\ell}$. Each layer $i$ (where $i=0, \\dots, N_{\\ell}-1$) is represented by its centroidal coordinate $y_i$ and area $A_i=b \\cdot t$:\n$$ y_i = -\\frac{h}{2} + \\left(i+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)t $$\nThis discrete representation transforms the integral definitions of section force resultants into Riemann sums:\n- Axial Force: $N = \\int_A \\sigma \\, \\mathrm{d}A \\approx \\sum_{i=0}^{N_{\\ell}-1} \\sigma_i \\, A_i$\n- Bending Moment: $M = \\int_A \\sigma y \\, \\mathrm{d}A \\approx \\sum_{i=0}^{N_{\\ell}-1} \\sigma_i \\, y_i \\, A_i$\nwhere $\\sigma_i$ is the uniform axial stress within layer $i$.\n\n**2. Layer Constitutive Model and Return Mapping**\n\nEach layer follows a one-dimensional, rate-independent, elastoplastic constitutive law. The total strain $\\varepsilon$ is additively decomposed into an elastic part $\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{e}}$ and a plastic part $\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}$:\n$$ \\varepsilon = \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{e}} + \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}} $$\nThe stress $\\sigma$ is related to the elastic strain by Hooke's law, $\\sigma = E \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{e}}$, where $E$ is the Young's modulus.\n\nPlastic deformation is governed by a yield function $\\varphi$, which depends on the stress $\\sigma$ and an internal state variable, the accumulated plastic strain $p$:\n$$ \\varphi(\\sigma, p) = |\\sigma| - (\\sigma_{y0} + R(p)) \\le 0 $$\nwhere $\\sigma_{y0}$ is the initial yield stress and $R(p)$ is the hardening function describing the expansion of the yield surface. Plastic flow occurs only when $\\varphi = 0$.\n\nThe evolution of plastic strain is described by an associative flow rule:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}} = \\mathrm{d}\\lambda \\, \\mathrm{sign}(\\sigma) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathrm{d}p = |\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}| = \\mathrm{d}\\lambda $$\nwhere $\\mathrm{d}\\lambda \\ge 0$ is the plastic multiplier. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions $\\mathrm{d}\\lambda \\ge 0$, $\\varphi \\le 0$, and $\\mathrm{d}\\lambda \\cdot \\varphi = 0$ must hold.\n\nFor a given total strain increment, the updated stress and state variables are found using a return-mapping algorithm:\n1.  **Elastic Predictor**: A trial stress is computed assuming the step is purely elastic:\n    $$ \\sigma^{\\mathrm{trial}} = E(\\varepsilon_{n+1} - \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}_n) $$\n    where the subscript $n$ denotes the state at the beginning of the increment.\n2.  **Yield Check**: The yield function is evaluated at the trial state:\n    $$ \\varphi^{\\mathrm{trial}} = |\\sigma^{\\mathrm{trial}}| - (\\sigma_{y0} + R(p_n)) $$\n    If $\\varphi^{\\mathrm{trial}} \\le 0$, the step is elastic. The state is updated as $\\sigma_{n+1} = \\sigma^{\\mathrm{trial}}$, $\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}_{n+1} = \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}_n$, $p_{n+1}=p_n$. The material's response is linear, so the algorithmic tangent modulus is $E^{\\mathrm{alg}} = E$.\n3.  **Plastic Corrector**: If $\\varphi^{\\mathrm{trial}}  0$, the step is plastic. The state must be \"returned\" to the updated yield surface. This requires solving for the plastic multiplier increment $\\Delta\\lambda  0$ that satisfies the consistency condition at the end of the step, $\\varphi(\\sigma_{n+1}, p_{n+1})=0$. Substituting the relations $\\sigma_{n+1} = \\sigma^{\\mathrm{trial}} - E\\Delta\\lambda\\,\\mathrm{sign}(\\sigma^{\\mathrm{trial}})$ and $p_{n+1} = p_n + \\Delta\\lambda$, we obtain a single scalar equation for $\\Delta\\lambda$:\n    $$ g(\\Delta\\lambda) = |\\sigma^{\\mathrm{trial}}| - E\\Delta\\lambda - (\\sigma_{y0} + R(p_n + \\Delta\\lambda)) = 0 $$\n    The solution for $\\Delta\\lambda$ depends on the form of the hardening function $R(p)$:\n    - **Elastic-Perfectly Plastic ($R(p)=0$):** The equation is linear, yielding a closed-form solution: $\\Delta\\lambda = \\frac{|\\sigma^{\\mathrm{trial}}| - \\sigma_{y0}}{E}$.\n    - **Linear Hardening ($R(p)=H p$):** The equation is again linear in $\\Delta\\lambda$: $\\Delta\\lambda = \\frac{|\\sigma^{\\mathrm{trial}}| - (\\sigma_{y0} + H p_n)}{E+H}$.\n    - **Voce Saturation Hardening ($R(p) = Q(1-e^{-b_{\\mathrm{V}}p})$):** The equation becomes nonlinear and must be solved numerically, for which we implement a scalar Newton's method. The iteration is $\\Delta\\lambda_{k+1} = \\Delta\\lambda_k - g(\\Delta\\lambda_k)/g'(\\Delta\\lambda_k)$, where $g'(\\Delta\\lambda) = -E - R'(p_n+\\Delta\\lambda)$.\n\nOnce $\\Delta\\lambda$ is found, the state is updated: $p_{n+1}=p_n+\\Delta\\lambda$, $\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}_{n+1} = \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}_n + \\Delta\\lambda\\,\\mathrm{sign}(\\sigma^{\\mathrm{trial}})$, and $\\sigma_{n+1} = E(\\varepsilon_{n+1} - \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}_{n+1})$.\n\nThe consistent algorithmic tangent modulus, $E^{\\mathrm{alg}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\sigma_{n+1}}{\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_{n+1}}$, is required for the section-level Newton iteration. For an elastic step, $E^{\\mathrm{alg}}=E$. For a plastic step, it is given by:\n$$ E^{\\mathrm{alg}} = \\frac{E R'(p_{n+1})}{E + R'(p_{n+1})} $$\nwhere $R'(p)$ is the hardening modulus. For perfect plasticity, $R'=0$, so $E^{\\mathrm{alg}}=0$. For linear hardening, $R'=H$, so $E^{\\mathrm{alg}}=\\frac{EH}{E+H}$.\n\n**3. Section-Level Equilibrium**\n\nFor each prescribed curvature $\\kappa_{n+1}$, we must find the axial strain $\\varepsilon_0$ that satisfies the axial force equilibrium condition, $N(\\varepsilon_0) = 0$. This is a scalar root-finding problem, which we solve using Newton's method.\nStarting with an initial guess for $\\varepsilon_0$, we iterate:\n$$ \\varepsilon_0^{(k+1)} = \\varepsilon_0^{(k)} - \\frac{r^{(k)}}{K^{(k)}} $$\nThe residual $r^{(k)}$ is the net axial force, and the tangent stiffness $K^{(k)}$ is its derivative with respect to $\\varepsilon_0$:\n$$ r^{(k)} = N(\\varepsilon_0^{(k)}) = \\sum_{i} \\sigma_i(\\varepsilon_0^{(k)}) \\, A_i $$\n$$ K^{(k)} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}N}{\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_0}\\bigg|_{\\varepsilon_0^{(k)}} = \\sum_{i} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\sigma_i}{\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_i} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_i}{\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_0} A_i = \\sum_{i} E^{\\mathrm{alg}}_i \\, A_i $$\nThe iteration continues until the magnitude of the residual $|r^{(k)}|$ is below a specified tolerance.\n\n**4. Simulation Algorithm**\n\nThe complete simulation proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Initialization**: Discretize the section and assign material properties (Young's modulus, yield stress, hardening law) to each layer based on its centroidal coordinate $y_i$. Initialize all state variables: plastic strains $\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}_i = 0$ and accumulated plastic strains $p_i = 0$ for all layers.\n2.  **Curvature Incrementation**: Loop through the prescribed sequence of equally spaced curvature values, from $\\kappa=0$ to the final target curvature.\n3.  **Section Analysis**: For each new curvature value $\\kappa_{n+1}$:\n    a.  Solve for the corresponding centroidal strain $\\varepsilon_0$ using the section-level Newton-Raphson method described above. The converged value from the previous curvature step serves as the initial guess.\n    b.  During each Newton iteration, the stress $\\sigma_i$ and algorithmic tangent $E^{\\mathrm{alg}}_i$ for each layer are computed using the return-mapping algorithm based on the current trial total strain $\\varepsilon_i = \\varepsilon_0 - \\kappa_{n+1}y_i$.\n4.  **State Update**: Once $\\varepsilon_0$ has converged, the final layer states ($\\sigma_i, \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{p}}_i, p_i$) for the current curvature step are computed and stored, becoming the \"previous\" state for the next increment.\n5.  **Moment Calculation**: After the final curvature step is solved, the corresponding bending moment is computed using the converged layer stresses: $M = \\sum_i \\sigma_i \\, y_i \\, A_i$.\n\nThis procedure is applied to each of the three test cases specified in the problem statement to obtain the final bending moments.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\n\n# Constants for numerical tolerances and limits\nSECTION_FORCE_TOL = 1e-6  # Tolerance for section axial force equilibrium [N]\nLAYER_CONSISTENCY_TOL = 1e-9  # Tolerance for layer consistency condition [Pa]\nMAX_SECTION_ITER = 20  # Max iterations for section Newton-Raphson\nMAX_LAYER_ITER = 20  # Max iterations for layer (Voce) Newton-Raphson\n\ndef round_to_sf(x, sf):\n    \"\"\"Rounds a number to a specified number of significant figures.\"\"\"\n    if x == 0:\n        return 0.0\n    return float(f\"{x:.{sf}g}\")\n\ndef _solve_voce_consistency(sig_trial_abs, p_n, E, sigy0, h_params):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the nonlinear consistency equation for Voce hardening\n    using Newton's method to find the plastic multiplier increment delta_lambda.\n    \"\"\"\n    Q, b_V = h_params\n    delta_lambda = 0.0\n\n    for _ in range(MAX_LAYER_ITER):\n        # Evaluate consistency residual g(delta_lambda)\n        p_np1 = p_n + delta_lambda\n        R_np1 = Q * (1.0 - math.exp(-b_V * p_np1))\n        g = sig_trial_abs - E * delta_lambda - (sigy0 + R_np1)\n\n        if abs(g)  LAYER_CONSISTENCY_TOL:\n            return delta_lambda\n\n        # Evaluate derivative g'(delta_lambda)\n        hardening_modulus_np1 = Q * b_V * math.exp(-b_V * p_np1)\n        g_prime = -E - hardening_modulus_np1\n        \n        # Newton update\n        delta_lambda -= g / g_prime\n\n    return delta_lambda # Return best effort if not converged\n\ndef update_layer_state(total_strain, ep_n, p_n, mat_props):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs the return-mapping algorithm for a single layer.\n    \"\"\"\n    E, sigy0, hardening_type, h_params = mat_props\n\n    # 1.
