Therefore, the problem is a valid exercise in local deformation theory. The problem is not flawed.\n\nVerdict: The problem is valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe solution will be constructed from first principles as required.\n\nFirst, we compute the deformation gradient $\\mathbf{F}(X)$.

The push-forward operation maps a material vector $V_X$ in the tangent space of the reference configuration to a spatial vector $v_x$ in the tangent space of the current configuration. By definition, this is accomplished by the action of the tangent map, which is represented by the deformation gradient $\\mathbf{F}$.\nThe relation is $v_x = \\mathbf{F}(X) V_X$.\nThe material vector is given as $V_X = (1, 2, 3)$, which we represent as a column matrix for calculation. The point of evaluation is $X = (1,0,0)$, and its spatial image is $x = \\varphi(1,0,0) = (1^2, 0, 0) = (1,0,0)$.\n$$\nv_x = \\mathbf{F}(1,0,0) V_X = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n2 \\\\\n3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n(2)(1) + (0)(2) + (0)(3) \\\\\n(0)(1) + (1)(2) + (0)(3) \\\\\n(0)(1) + (0)(2) + (1)(3)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 \\\\\n2 \\\\\n3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThus, the pushed-forward vector at $x = (1,0,0)$ is $v_x = (2, 2, 3)$.\n\nThird, we provide a geometric interpretation. The deformation gradient $\\mathbf{F}$ maps an infinitesimal material line element $d\\mathbf{X}$ to an infinitesimal spatial line element $d\\mathbf{x}$ via $d\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{F} d\\mathbf{X}$. At $X = (1,0,0)$, $\\mathbf{F}$ is a diagonal matrix.\n- **Stretch**: The diagonal elements of $\\mathbf{F}$ represent the stretches along the corresponding coordinate axes, assuming these are the principal directions of stretch. At $X=(1,0,0)$, the principal stretches are $\\lambda_1 = 2$, $\\lambda_2 = 1$, and $\\lambda_3 = 1$. This means an infinitesimal line element aligned with the $X_1$ direction is stretched by a factor of $2$, while line elements along the $X_2$ and $X_3$ directions maintain their original length.\n- **Shear**: The off-diagonal terms of $\\mathbf{F}$ are all zero. This indicates that there is no shear deformation at this point with respect to the Cartesian basis.  The angles between infinitesimal line elements initially aligned with the coordinate axes are preserved during the deformation.\n- **Volume Change**: The local change in volume is quantified by the Jacobian determinant $J = \\det(\\mathbf{F})$, which represents the ratio of an infinitesimal volume element in the current configuration to its corresponding volume in the reference configuration. We compute the Jacobian at the point of interest.\n$$\nJ(1,0,0) = \\det \\mathbf{F}(1,0,0) = \\det\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= (2)(1)(1) = 2\n$$\nA value of $J=2$ indicates that an infinitesimal volume of material at $X=(1,0,0)$ has its volume doubled upon deformation. The motion is locally volume-increasing.\n\nThe push-forward of $V_X=(1,2,3)$ to $v_x=(2,2,3)$ demonstrates this transformation on a specific vector. The component of $V_X$ along the $E_1$ axis is stretched by a factor of $2$, while its other components are unchanged, consistent with the principal stretches.\n\nThe problem asks for the scalar Jacobian $J(1,0,0)$ as the final reported quantity.

Its component matrix $E$ in the $\\{\\mathbf{A}_I\\}$ basis is therefore:\n$$\nE = \\frac{1}{2} (C - G) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} 1.45 & 1.61 \\\\ 1.61 & 2.548 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0.8 \\\\ 0.8 & 1.64 \\end{pmatrix} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.45 & 0.81 \\\\ 0.81 & 0.908 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.225 & 0.405 \\\\ 0.405 & 0.454 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**Task 2: Computation of Scalar Strain**\n\nWe are given a material direction with components $u = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ in the basis $\\{\\mathbf{A}_I\\}$. The scalar Green-Lagrange strain $e$ along a material direction $\\mathbf{U}$ is defined as the ratio of the strain energy density associated with that direction to its initial squared length: $e = \\frac{\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{U}, \\mathbf{U})}{G(\\mathbf{U}, \\mathbf{U})}$. In component form, this is $e = \\frac{u^{\\mathsf{T}} E u}{u^{\\mathsf{T}} G u}$.\n\nWe compute the numerator $u^{\\mathsf{T}} E u$:\n$$\nu^{\\mathsf{T}} E u = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.225 & 0.405 \\\\ 0.405 & 0.454 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.225 + 0.405 \\\\ 0.405 + 0.454 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.630 \\\\ 0.859 \\end{pmatrix} = 0.630 + 0.859 = 1.489\n$$\nWe compute the denominator $u^{\\mathsf{T}} G u$, which represents the squared length of the vector $\\mathbf{U} = 1\\mathbf{A}_1 + 1\\mathbf{A}_2$:\n$$\nu^{\\mathsf{T}} G u = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0.8 \\\\ 0.8 & 1.64 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 + 0.8 \\\\ 0.8 + 1.64 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1.8 \\\\ 2.44 \\end{pmatrix} = 1.8 + 2.44 = 4.24\n$$\nThe scalar strain $e$ is the ratio of these two values:\n$$\ne = \\frac{1.489}{4.24} \\approx 0.351179245...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we obtain $e = 0.3512$.\n\n**Task 3: Discussion of Invariance**\n\nThe components of tensors and vectors are, by definition, dependent on the choice of basis. In this problem, the matrices representing the reference metric ($G$), the right Cauchy-Green tensor ($C$), the Green-Lagrange strain tensor ($E$), and the material direction vector ($u$) are all basis-dependent. For example, in the standard orthonormal basis, the metric $G$ would be the identity matrix, but in the $\\{\\mathbf{A}_I\\}$ basis, it is not.\n\nHowever, the final scalar quantity $e$ is an invariant. This is because it is a scalar constructed from a full contraction of tensors and vectors. Geometrically, $e = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{L_f^2}{L_0^2} - 1\\right)$, where $L_0$ is the initial length of the material fiber and $L_f$ is its final length. These physical lengths are independent of the coordinate system used to describe them. The expression $v^{\\mathsf{T}} E v$ for a $G$-normalized vector $v$ (i.e. $v^{\\mathsf{T}} G v = 1$) represents the tensorial operation $\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{V}, \\mathbf{V})$, where $\\mathbf{V}$ is the physical vector. Under a change of reference basis $\\mathbf{A}' = \\mathbf{A}T$, vector components transform as $v' = T^{-1}v$ and covariant tensor components transform as $E' = T^{\\mathsf{T}} E T$. The scalar quantity $e$ transforms as $e' = (v')^{\\mathsf{T}} E' v' = (T^{-1}v)^{\\mathsf{T}} (T^{\\mathsf{T}} E T) (T^{-1}v) = v^{\\mathsf{T}}(T^{-1})^{\\mathsf{T}} T^{\\mathsf{T}} E T T^{-1} v = v^{\\mathsf{T}}E v = e$. This confirms its invariance. The scalar $e$ is a physical observable and must not depend on arbitrary choices of basis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3512}$$", "id": "2677206"}]}
