## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the fundamental principles and mechanics of objective time derivatives. We have seen that the [material time derivative](@entry_id:190892) of a tensor is not objective, as it includes spurious contributions from the observer's own rotation. To rectify this, various [objective rates](@entry_id:198692)—such as the Jaumann, Green–Naghdi, and Truesdell rates—were developed to ensure that constitutive laws adhere to the [principle of material frame-indifference](@entry_id:188488). This chapter moves beyond the theoretical necessity of these rates to explore their practical consequences and interdisciplinary applications. We will demonstrate that the choice of a specific objective rate is not a mere mathematical formality but a critical constitutive decision that profoundly influences the predicted behavior of materials in [solid mechanics](@entry_id:164042), fluid dynamics, and computational modeling.

### The Foundational Requirement: Objectivity in Rigid Body Motion

The primary motivation for [objective stress rates](@entry_id:199282) is to isolate the change in stress caused by [material deformation](@entry_id:169356) from the apparent change caused by pure [rigid body rotation](@entry_id:167024). A constitutive law must not predict a stress response when a material is merely rotated without any change in its internal state. The [material time derivative](@entry_id:190892), $\dot{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$, fails this fundamental test. For a material undergoing a pure rigid rotation with a non-zero [spin tensor](@entry_id:187346) $\boldsymbol{W}$ but no deformation ($\boldsymbol{D}=\boldsymbol{0}$), the material derivative of the Cauchy stress is generally non-zero, given by $\dot{\boldsymbol{\sigma}} = \boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{\sigma} - \boldsymbol{\sigma}\boldsymbol{W}$. This non-zero rate arises purely from the changing orientation of the stress tensor's components in the fixed spatial frame and does not reflect any intrinsic change in the material's stress state [@problem_id:2697696] [@problem_id:2646926].

Objective rates are constructed precisely to nullify this spurious rotational contribution. For instance, the Jaumann rate, $\overset{\circ}{\boldsymbol{\sigma}} = \dot{\boldsymbol{\sigma}} + \boldsymbol{\sigma}\boldsymbol{W} - \boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{\sigma}$, by its very definition, subtracts the term $\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{\sigma} - \boldsymbol{\sigma}\boldsymbol{W}$ from the material derivative. Consequently, for a stress tensor that is "frozen" in a rigidly rotating body, the Jaumann rate is zero. Similar analyses show that the Green–Naghdi and Truesdell rates also vanish for such motions, confirming that they correctly register no change in stress during a pure rigid rotation. This fundamental property ensures that any stress predicted by a [constitutive model](@entry_id:747751) using these rates is a response to genuine deformation, not [rigid motion](@entry_id:155339) [@problem_id:2666483].

### Applications in Rheology and Fluid Mechanics

In the study of non-Newtonian fluids, such as polymer melts, solutions, and suspensions, [constitutive models](@entry_id:174726) must capture complex behaviors like [shear-thinning](@entry_id:150203) and the emergence of [normal stress differences](@entry_id:191914) in shear flows. Objective rates are central to the formulation of such [viscoelastic models](@entry_id:192483).

A classic example is the prediction of the first [normal stress difference](@entry_id:199507), $N_1 = \sigma_{11} - \sigma_{22}$, in a steady simple shear flow described by the [velocity field](@entry_id:271461) $\boldsymbol{v} = (\dot{\gamma}x_2, 0, 0)$. In such a flow, a Newtonian fluid exhibits only a shear stress, $\sigma_{12}$. However, [viscoelastic fluids](@entry_id:198948) also develop non-zero normal stress components. Constitutive models like the corotational Jeffreys or Maxwell models, which employ the Jaumann derivative, can predict this phenomenon. The inclusion of the spin terms $\boldsymbol{\sigma}\boldsymbol{W} - \boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ in the Jaumann rate couples the evolution of the shear stress $\sigma_{12}$ with the [normal stress](@entry_id:184326) components. Solving the [constitutive equation](@entry_id:267976) for a steady [simple shear](@entry_id:180497) flow reveals that $N_1$ is a function of the shear rate $\dot{\gamma}$, typically proportional to $\dot{\gamma}^2$ at low shear rates. This prediction, which is a direct consequence of using a corotational objective rate, is qualitatively consistent with experimental observations for many polymeric liquids [@problem_id:124739] [@problem_id:1490133]. The explicit calculation of these rates for given velocity and stress fields is a standard procedure in analyzing fluid behavior under complex kinematic conditions [@problem_id:656239].

The choice between different [objective rates](@entry_id:198692), such as the Jaumann rate and the upper-convected Oldroyd-B rate (which is related to the Truesdell rate), is a key distinction in rheological modeling. The difference between these rates can be expressed directly in terms of the [rate-of-deformation tensor](@entry_id:184787) $\boldsymbol{D}$. Specifically, the difference between the Oldroyd-B and Jaumann derivatives of $\boldsymbol{D}$ is $-2\boldsymbol{D}^2$. This algebraic relationship highlights that the models will diverge in flows where the rate of deformation is significant, leading to distinct predictions for the rheological response [@problem_id:527254].

### Consequences in Solid Mechanics and Hypoelasticity

While essential for objectivity, the use of rate-form [constitutive equations](@entry_id:138559), known as [hypoelasticity](@entry_id:204371), introduces significant complexity and subtleties. The choice of objective rate has profound implications for the predicted mechanical response, particularly at [large strains](@entry_id:751152).

#### The Choice of Rate as a Constitutive Assumption

It is a common misconception that all [objective rates](@entry_id:198692) are more or less equivalent. In fact, for a general deformation involving both stretching and rotation, different [objective rates](@entry_id:198692) yield distinct values. A direct calculation for a material in simple shear, for instance, shows that the Jaumann, Green–Naghdi, and Truesdell rates of the same stress tensor can have significantly different values, leading to different predictions of the stress evolution [@problem_id:2666490].

This divergence is further illustrated in volumetric deformations. Consider a uniform expansion where a material is subjected to equal stretching in all directions. A [hypoelastic model](@entry_id:750490) relates an [objective stress rate](@entry_id:168809) to the rate of deformation. By integrating the [constitutive law](@entry_id:167255) using different [objective rates](@entry_id:198692) (Jaumann, Green–Naghdi, Truesdell), one finds that each model predicts a different evolution for the [mean stress](@entry_id:751819) (pressure). When compared to the "exact" response derived from a corresponding path-independent (hyperelastic) model, none of the [hypoelastic models](@entry_id:184632) perfectly replicate the hyperelastic behavior over the full deformation path, underscoring their nature as approximations with inherent limitations [@problem_id:2666499]. The Truesdell rate is unique in this context due to its inclusion of the term $(\operatorname{tr}\boldsymbol{L})\boldsymbol{\sigma}$, which explicitly accounts for the effect of volume change on the stress rate. For a purely dilatational motion, this term plays a crucial role and distinguishes the Truesdell rate's predictions from other rates like the upper-convected rate [@problem_id:2666480].

#### Path Dependence and Spurious Effects in Hypoelastic Models

A critical consequence of the rate-based formulation is [path dependence](@entry_id:138606). Unlike [hyperelastic materials](@entry_id:190241), where the stress is a unique function of the current strain, the stress in a hypoelastic material depends on the entire history of deformation. This can be starkly demonstrated by subjecting a [hypoelastic model](@entry_id:750490) to a closed-loop deformation path that starts and ends at the same strain state. For a path involving sequences of shear, a model based on the Jaumann rate predicts a non-zero [residual stress](@entry_id:138788) upon returning to the origin. This reveals that energy is dissipated over the cycle, a behavior fundamentally different from true elasticity and a key indicator that [hypoelasticity](@entry_id:204371) does not, in general, define a [stored energy function](@entry_id:166355) [@problem_id:2666521].

This [path dependence](@entry_id:138606) manifests in [computational mechanics](@entry_id:174464) as a source of unphysical artifacts. A well-known example is the prediction of spurious oscillations in simulations of [simple shear](@entry_id:180497) at [large strains](@entry_id:751152). When a [hypoelastic model](@entry_id:750490) based on the Jaumann rate is used, the predicted shear stress $\sigma_{12}$ does not increase monotonically with [shear strain](@entry_id:175241) $\gamma$. Instead, it oscillates, which contradicts experimental observations for most metals. This unphysical behavior arises because the Jaumann rate corotates the stress with the material spin, which in simple shear is constant. In contrast, rates like the Green–Naghdi and Truesdell rates, which are based on different kinematic measures of rotation, can mitigate or eliminate these oscillations, predicting a more realistic monotonic response. This makes the choice of objective rate a critical issue in the implementation of material models in finite element codes [@problem_id:2666488].

The choice of rate can even lead to qualitatively different physical predictions. When comparing [hypoelastic models](@entry_id:184632) for simple shear using the Jaumann rate versus the logarithmic rate, the predictions for [normal stress differences](@entry_id:191914) diverge dramatically at [large strains](@entry_id:751152). The Jaumann model predicts a bounded, periodic evolution of [normal stress](@entry_id:184326), while the logarithmic rate model predicts unbounded logarithmic growth. This demonstrates that the selection of an objective rate is a constitutive choice that dictates the fundamental character of the predicted material behavior at large deformations [@problem_id:2666509].

#### Integrability and Connection to Hyperelasticity

Despite the general path-dependence of [hypoelasticity](@entry_id:204371), there are special cases where these models become integrable and coincide with hyperelastic formulations. This occurs for deformation paths that are irrotational (i.e., the [spin tensor](@entry_id:187346) $\boldsymbol{W}$ is zero). In such cases, the Jaumann rate reduces to the simple [material time derivative](@entry_id:190892). For a specific class of [hypoelastic models](@entry_id:184632) (grade-1), integration over an irrotational path yields a stress that is identical to that derived from a Hencky hyperelastic potential, which is based on the [logarithmic strain](@entry_id:751438). This special case highlights that the non-integrability and [path dependence](@entry_id:138606) of [hypoelastic models](@entry_id:184632) are intrinsically linked to the rotational aspects of the deformation history [@problem_id:2647784].

### Advanced Applications in Finite Strain Plasticity

The principles of [objective rates](@entry_id:198692) find their most sophisticated application in the formulation of constitutive laws for [finite strain plasticity](@entry_id:175182), particularly in models that include [internal state variables](@entry_id:750754) to describe phenomena like [kinematic hardening](@entry_id:172077) (the Bauschinger effect).

In standard isotropic von Mises ($J_2$) plasticity, the yield condition and [flow rule](@entry_id:177163) are expressed in terms of rotational invariants of the stress tensor. The [flow stress](@entry_id:198884), as described by models like the Johnson-Cook law, is a scalar function of other scalars (equivalent plastic strain, strain rate, temperature). Because the core plasticity model is isotropic and based on invariants, it can be coupled with any valid [objective stress rate](@entry_id:168809) (Jaumann, Green–Naghdi, etc.) to formulate a complete, frame-indifferent [constitutive law](@entry_id:167255). While different choices of rate will lead to quantitatively different stress predictions over a [finite deformation](@entry_id:172086) path, the fundamental requirement of objectivity is satisfied by any of them [@problem_id:2646926].

However, for more advanced models, particularly those involving the evolution of internal variables that represent [material anisotropy](@entry_id:204117) or substructure, the choice of [corotational frame](@entry_id:747893) becomes critical. In finite-strain [kinematic hardening](@entry_id:172077), a backstress tensor $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ is introduced in an intermediate, plastically-deformed configuration. To ensure the model is independent of arbitrary rotations of this intermediate configuration (a principle known as "plastic indifference"), the evolution law for the [backstress](@entry_id:198105) must use an objective rate that corotates with the kinematics of plastic flow. It has been rigorously shown that the correct choice is an objective rate based on the [plastic spin](@entry_id:188692), $\boldsymbol{W}_p = \operatorname{skw}(\boldsymbol{L}_p)$, where $\boldsymbol{L}_p = \dot{\boldsymbol{F}}_p \boldsymbol{F}_p^{-1}$. Using an objective rate based on the total spatial spin $\boldsymbol{W}$ or the elastic spin $\boldsymbol{W}_e$ would violate this fundamental principle and lead to a model that is physically inconsistent. This demonstrates the crucial importance of selecting the physically appropriate spin measure when formulating evolution laws for [internal state variables](@entry_id:750754) in advanced [material modeling](@entry_id:173674) [@problem_id:2693898].

In summary, objective time derivatives are an indispensable tool in modern [continuum mechanics](@entry_id:155125). Far from being an abstract correction, the specific choice of objective rate shapes the predictive capabilities of [constitutive models](@entry_id:174726), influencing everything from the prediction of normal stresses in polymer flows to the stability of numerical simulations in [solid mechanics](@entry_id:164042) and the fundamental structure of advanced plasticity theories. A deep understanding of their application and consequences is therefore essential for any serious work in the [mechanics of materials](@entry_id:201885).
