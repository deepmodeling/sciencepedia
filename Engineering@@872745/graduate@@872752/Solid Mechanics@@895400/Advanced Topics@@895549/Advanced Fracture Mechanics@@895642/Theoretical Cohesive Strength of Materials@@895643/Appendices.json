The total potential energy per atom, $U_{\\text{atom}}$, is the sum of the energies of the bonds connected to it, divided by $2$ to correct for double counting. Therefore, the energy per atom is $U_{\\text{atom}}(r) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\phi(r) + \\phi(r)) = \\phi(r)$.\n\nAt equilibrium, the nearest-neighbor separation is $r = r_{0}$. The potential energy per atom at equilibrium is:\n$$\nU_{\\text{atom}}(r_{0}) = \\phi(r_{0}) = D\\left(\\left[1-\\exp\\left(-\\alpha\\left(r_{0}-r_{0}\\right)\\right)\\right]^{2}-1\\right) = D\\left(\\left[1-\\exp(0)\\right]^{2}-1\\right) = D\\left(\\left[1-1\\right]^{2}-1\\right) = -D\n$$\nThis represents the minimum energy state of an atom within the chain.\n\nThe cohesive energy, $E_{\\text{coh}}$, is defined as the energy required per atom to separate the solid into its constituent, non-interacting atoms. This corresponds to the energy needed to increase the interatomic separation from its equilibrium value $r_{0}$ to infinity. The energy of an atom when infinitely separated from its neighbors is given by the reference energy:\n$$\nU_{\\text{atom}}(\\infty) = \\phi(\\infty) = 0\n$$\nThe cohesive energy is thus the difference between the final (separated) energy and the initial (equilibrium) energy:\n$$\nE_{\\text{coh}} = U_{\\text{atom}}(\\infty) - U_{\\text{atom}}(r_{0}) = 0 - (-D) = D\n$$\nThe adopted sign convention is that the cohesive energy is a positive quantity, representing the energy that must be supplied to the system to overcome the atomic bonds. The binding energy of the solid would be the negative of this value, $-D$.\n\n(b) Ideal Tensile Strength\nThe strain energy density, $W$, is defined as the potential energy per unit reference volume. The reference volume per atom is given as $V_{0} = A r_{0}$. The strain energy per atom is $U_{\\text{atom}}(r) = \\phi(r)$. Therefore, the strain energy density as a function of the separation $r$ is:\n$$\nW(r) = \\frac{\\phi(r)}{A r_{0}}\n$$\nThe deformation is described by the stretch $\\lambda$, where $r = \\lambda r_{0}$. The nominal (first Piola-Kirchhoff) stress, $\\sigma$, is the work-conjugate to the stretch $\\lambda$. For uniaxial tension, this relationship is:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial \\lambda}\n$$\nWe compute the derivative using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\sigma(\\lambda) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\lambda} \\left( \\frac{\\phi(\\lambda r_{0})}{A r_{0}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{A r_{0}} \\frac{d\\phi(r)}{dr}\\bigg|_{r=\\lambda r_{0}} \\frac{dr}{d\\lambda}\n$$\nSince $r(\\lambda) = \\lambda r_{0}$, we have $\\frac{dr}{d\\lambda} = r_{0}$.

To find the maximum, we must find the separation $r^{\\star}$ where the derivative of the stress with respect to $r$ is zero, i.e., $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dr}=0$. This is equivalent to finding the inflection point of the potential energy curve, where $\\frac{d^{2}\\phi}{dr^{2}}=0$.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{dr} = \\frac{1}{A} \\frac{d^{2}\\phi}{dr^{2}} = \\frac{2D\\alpha}{A} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\alpha\\left(r-r_{0}\\right)\\right) - \\exp\\left(-2\\alpha\\left(r-r_{0}\\right)\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{dr} = \\frac{2D\\alpha}{A} \\left[ -\\alpha\\exp\\left(-\\alpha\\left(r-r_{0}\\right)\\right) - (-2\\alpha)\\exp\\left(-2\\alpha\\left(r-r_{0}\\right)\\right) \\right]\n$$\nSetting $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dr}=0$ at $r=r^{\\star}$:\n$$\n-\\alpha\\exp\\left(-\\alpha\\left(r^{\\star}-r_{0}\\right)\\right) + 2\\alpha\\exp\\left(-2\\alpha\\left(r^{\\star}-r_{0}\\right)\\right) = 0\n$$\nSince $\\alpha \\neq 0$, we can divide by it:\n$$\n2\\exp\\left(-2\\alpha\\left(r^{\\star}-r_{0}\\right)\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\alpha\\left(r^{\\star}-r_{0}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nLetting $y = \\exp\\left(-\\alpha\\left(r^{\\star}-r_{0}\\right)\\right)$, the equation becomes $2y^2 = y$.
