The derivation must begin from the fundamental equations of three-dimensional elasticity without recourse to simplified plate or shell theories.\n\nThe local equilibrium of a continuous medium, in the absence of body forces, is described by the Cauchy equilibrium equations. In a Cartesian coordinate system $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$, with $z \\equiv x_3$, these equations are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{11}}{\\partial x_1} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{12}}{\\partial x_2} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{13}}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tau_{12}}{\\partial x_1} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{22}}{\\partial x_2} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{23}}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tau_{13}}{\\partial x_1} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{23}}{\\partial x_2} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{33}}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\nHere, $\\sigma_{ij}$ are the components of the Cauchy stress tensor, with the engineering notation $\\tau_{ij} = \\sigma_{ij}$ for $i \\neq j$.\n\nThe problem statement provides a critical condition: in the region of interest, \"all stress and strain fields are independent of in-plane coordinates $x_1$ and $x_2$\". This translates mathematically to the following constraints on the gradients of the stress components:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (\\cdot)}{\\partial x_1} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial (\\cdot)}{\\partial x_2} = 0\n$$\nfor all stress components $\\sigma_{ij}$. Consequently, the stress components can only be functions of the through-thickness coordinate, $z$. For example, $\\sigma_{11} = \\sigma_{11}(z)$, $\\tau_{12} = \\tau_{12}(z)$, $\\tau_{13} = \\tau_{13}(z)$, and so forth.\n\nTo determine the distribution of the interlaminar shear stress $\\tau_{13}(z)$, we focus on the first equilibrium equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{11}}{\\partial x_1} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{12}}{\\partial x_2} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{13}}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\nApplying the condition of in-plane independence, the first two terms vanish:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{11}}{\\partial x_1} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tau_{12}}{\\partial x_2} = 0\n$$\nThe equilibrium equation thus simplifies dramatically. As $\\tau_{13}$ is a function of $z$ only, the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial \\tau_{13}}{\\partial z}$ becomes an ordinary derivative $\\frac{d\\tau_{13}}{dz}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n0 + 0 + \\frac{d\\tau_{13}}{dz} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tau_{13}}{dz} = 0\n$$\nThis is a simple first-order ordinary differential equation for $\\tau_{13}(z)$.

This result shows that, under the given assumptions, the shear stress $\\tau_{13}$ must be constant through the entire thickness of the laminate.\n\nTo determine the value of the constant $C$, we must apply the boundary conditions. The problem states that the outer surfaces of the laminate at $z = \\pm h/2$ are traction-free. The traction vector on a surface with normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$ is given by $\\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$. For the top surface at $z = +h/2$, the outward normal vector is $\\mathbf{n} = (0, 0, 1)$. The traction components are $t_1 = \\tau_{13}$, $t_2 = \\tau_{23}$, and $t_3 = \\sigma_{33}$. The traction-free condition implies that these components are zero. Specifically, for our interest:\n$$\n\\tau_{13}(z = +h/2) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this condition into our general solution $\\tau_{13}(z) = C$:\n$$\nC = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the constant of integration is zero. This determines the interlaminar shear stress distribution completely. The solution is:\n$$\n\\tau_{13}(z) = 0\n$$\nThis result holds for all $z$ in the domain $z \\in [-h/2, h/2]$. The condition at the bottom surface, $\\tau_{13}(z = -h/2) = 0$, is also satisfied.\n\nThis conclusion, derived from first principles as required, aligns with the predictions of Classical Lamination Theory (CLT). CLT is based on a plane stress assumption for the laminate, valid for regions far from geometric or loading discontinuities (such as free edges). The core assumption of independence from in-plane coordinates effectively reduces the 3D elasticity problem to the CLT state of stress, wherein interlaminar stresses ($\\tau_{13}, \\tau_{23}, \\sigma_{33}$) are identically zero.

A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation and Evaluation of Options**\n\nThe core of this problem lies in the behavior of stresses at the point where the free edge ($x=0$) intersects the interface between the $0^{\\circ}$ and $90^{\\circ}$ plies. For a perfectly bonded, linearly elastic bimaterial corner under load, the theory of elasticity predicts a stress singularity. The interlaminar stresses $\\sigma_{iz}$ (where $i=x,z$) along the interface $z=z_i$ behave asymptotically as a function of distance $r$ from the free edge:\n$$ \\sigma_{iz}(r, z_i) \\sim K r^{\\lambda - 1} $$\nwhere $r$ is the distance from the free-edge/interface corner. The exponent $\\lambda$ is a function of the material properties of the two plies and is typically in the range $0  \\lambda  1$. The coefficient $K$ is a generalized stress intensity factor that depends on the geometry and loading.\n\nSince $\\lambda  1$, the term $r^{\\lambda-1}$ approaches infinity as $r \\to 0$. This means the theoretical stress at the corner is infinite. Consequently, any numerical method that attempts to find a converged \"peak nodal stress\" at this exact point ($r=0$) is fundamentally flawed, as the result will diverge with mesh refinement. A scientifically sound method must instead seek a mesh-independent characterization of this singular field. We now evaluate the proposed options against this principle.\n\n**A. Use a uniform mesh across the width and through the thickness. For each mesh refinement, record the maximum nodal value of $\\sigma_{xz}$ anywhere in the model. Declare convergence of the peak interlaminar shear stress when the change in this global maximum is less than $1\\%$ between two successive uniform refinements.**\n\nThis proposal is incorrect for two fundamental reasons. First, a uniform mesh is grossly inefficient for resolving a highly localized stress concentration at the free edge. The vast majority of computational effort is wasted in the interior of the laminate where the stress state is simple. Second, and more critically, the method is based on tracking the maximum nodal value of $\\sigma_{xz}$, which occurs at the singular point. As established, this value is theoretically infinite in the linear elastic model. With each mesh refinement, the element closest to the singularity becomes smaller, and the computed nodal stress at its corner will increase without bound. The computed value will never converge, and declaring \"convergence\" based on an arbitrary $1\\%$ change between two coarse meshes is a meaningless and misleading procedure. This demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of the problem.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. Use an $h$-refined boundary-layer mesh graded toward the free edge at $x=0$ with a geometric progression of in-plane element sizes of ratio $q$ with $q0.7$ in a band of width $\\mathcal{O}(t)$ from the edge, and with at least $12$ linear elements per ply through the thickness in that band. Maintain in-plane element aspect ratios below $3$ in the refined region. For convergence of the peak interlaminar shear, monitor $\\sigma_{xz}(r_0,z_i)$ at a fixed offset $r_0=0.1\\,t_p$ from the free edge along $x$ evaluated at the $0^{\\circ}/90^{\\circ}$ interface $z=z_i$ (with $t_p$ the single-ply thickness), and apply Richardson extrapolation across three successively refined meshes. Declare convergence when the extrapolated $\\sigma_{xz}(r_0,z_i)$ and observed order of convergence change by less than $2\\%$ between refinement levels.**\n\nThis proposal is scientifically sound and methodologically rigorous. It correctly identifies that the nodal stress at the singularity point itself is not a valid convergence metric. Instead, it proposes monitoring the stress at a small but fixed distance, $r_0=0.1\\,t_p$, from the singularity. At any point $r_00$, the stress is finite and the solution is differentiable. Therefore, the value of $\\sigma_{xz}(r_0,z_i)$ must converge to a unique value as the mesh is refined. The use of a graded $h$-refined mesh is the appropriate strategy for efficiently capturing the steep gradients in the boundary layer near the free edge. The specific recommendations for mesh construction (geometric progression, elements per ply, aspect ratio control) represent good engineering practice. Furthermore, the use of Richardson extrapolation based on a sequence of three refined meshes is a powerful, standard technique to estimate the continuum value and the practical order of convergence, providing a robust and quantitative basis for declaring convergence. This entire procedure avoids the singularity while providing a mesh-objective measure of stress in the high-stress region.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. Keep exactly one element through the thickness of each ply and perform only $p$-refinement in the in-plane directions near the free edge. Use the total strain energy of the entire laminate as the sole convergence measure; declare the peak interlaminar stresses converged when the global strain energy changes by less than $0.5\\%$ upon further $p$-refinement.**\n\nThis proposal contains multiple severe errors. First, discretizing each ply with only one element through its thickness is completely insufficient. The interlaminar stresses $\\sigma_{xz}$ and $\\sigma_{zz}$ have a complex distribution through the thickness that cannot possibly be captured by such a coarse model unless one uses sophisticated, non-standard element formulations not mentioned here. Standard displacement-based elements will yield grossly inaccurate stress distributions. Second, strain energy is a global, integral quantity. Its convergence is dominated by the low-gradient regions that comprise most of the laminate's volume. Convergence of global strain energy provides almost no information about the convergence of local stresses in a small region containing a singularity. It is entirely possible for the global strain energy to be converged to within $0.5\\%$ while the local stresses at the free edge are still highly inaccurate and far from converged. Equating global energy convergence with local stress convergence is a fundamental error in the application of the finite element method.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Use an $h$-refined graded mesh concentrated within a distance $\\mathcal{O}(t)$ of the free edge with at least $10$ elements per ply through the thickness in that region, and extract the computed profile of $\\sigma_{xz}(r,z_i)$ along the $0^{\\circ}/90^{\\circ}$ interface for distances $r$ in a fitting window $r\\in[0.05\\,t,\\,0.5\\,t]$ from the edge. For each mesh, fit $\\sigma_{xz}(r,z_i)$ to an asymptotic form $\\sigma_{xz}(r,z_i)\\sim A\\,r^{\\lambda-1}$ over the window to estimate the amplitude $A$ and exponent $\\lambda$. Declare convergence of the peak interlaminar stress intensity when both $A$ and $\\lambda$ change by less than $5\\%$ upon further refinement.**\n\nThis proposal is also scientifically sound and represents an advanced, correct approach. It directly confronts the singular nature of the stress field. Instead of trying to compute a \"peak stress\", it seeks to determine the parameters $(A, \\lambda)$ that define the intensity and order of the singularity. These parameters are finite and should converge with mesh refinement, providing a mesh-objective characterization of the stress state. The procedure of fitting the numerical solution within a specific window near the singularity to the known asymptotic form is a standard technique in computational fracture mechanics. The proposed mesh strategy (graded, $h$-refined) is appropriate. The convergence criterion, based on the stability of the estimated parameters $A$ and $\\lambda$ upon further mesh refinement, is rigorous and directly addresses the problem of quantifying the intensity of the singular field. This method yields a physically meaningful measure of the \"peak stress intensity\".\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**E. Introduce cohesive zone interface elements with a traction–separation law of characteristic length $\\ell_c$ along all ply interfaces, and adopt a quasi-uniform mesh with element size $h\\approx \\ell_c$ near the free edge. Declare the peak interlaminar stresses converged when the interface damage variable history becomes mesh-independent to within $2\\%$ upon reducing $h$ while keeping $\\ell_c$ fixed.**\n\nThis proposal is flawed because it does not solve the problem as stated. The problem is posed within the framework of linear elasticity with perfectly bonded interfaces. Introducing cohesive zone elements fundamentally changes the physical model to one of non-linear fracture mechanics. This approach regularizes the singularity by introducing a material-dependent strength and a characteristic length $\\ell_c$, thus a finite peak stress is obtained. However, this is an answer to a different question. It violates the explicit instruction to base reasoning on the fundamentals of \"linear elasticity\" and \"perfectly bonded interfaces\". It also introduces new material parameters ($\\ell_c$ and the traction-separation law itself) which would require \"prior calibrations or empirical fitting\", another point of non-compliance. While cohesive zone modeling is a valid technique for studying delamination, it is not a method for analyzing the stress singularity predicted by linear elastic theory, which is the focus of the posed problem.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BD}$$", "id": "2649383"}]}
