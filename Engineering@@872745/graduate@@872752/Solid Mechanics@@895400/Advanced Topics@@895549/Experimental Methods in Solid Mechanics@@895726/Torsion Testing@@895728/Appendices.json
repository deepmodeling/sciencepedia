In torsion testing, even minor misalignment of the grips can introduce significant bending moments, corrupting the intended pure shear condition.

The grips’ axes are parallel but laterally offset by a small eccentricity $e$, so that the centroidal axes of the end cross-sections are separated by a transverse distance $e$ while the end sections remain parallel. The machine applies a quasi-static torque $T$ about its own axis. Assume linear elasticity, small deformations, Saint-Venant torsion for the circular shaft, and Euler–Bernoulli bending for the lateral response. The cross-sectional polar second moment is $J$ and the second moment of area about the relevant bending axis is $I$; the shear modulus is $G$ and Young’s modulus is $E$.\n\nBecause of the misalignment, the specimen develops a self-equilibrated bending field that accommodates the enforced end offset $e$ while keeping both end cross-sections free of bending rotation. In the torsion test, a shear strain gauge rosette is used to measure the surface shear strain due to torsion. To prevent contamination of the shear-strain measurement by spurious bending, the laboratory specifies a measurement tolerance $\\eta \\in (0,1)$ defined as the maximum allowable ratio of the magnitude of the bending-induced axial normal strain at the outer surface to the magnitude of the torsion-induced shear strain at the outer surface, both evaluated at the same applied torque $T$.\n\nStarting from fundamental beam and torsion relations (equilibrium, compatibility, and linear elastic constitutive laws), derive the maximum permissible eccentricity $e_{\\max}$ such that the ratio of the spurious bending axial strain magnitude at the surface to the true torsional shear strain magnitude at the surface does not exceed $\\eta$. Express $e_{\\max}$ in terms of $L$, $G$, $J$, $T$, and $\\eta$ only, eliminating any intermediate quantities not required by the final tolerance definition.

The misalignment imposes a fixed-end condition on the specimen, which acts as a beam of length $L$. Let the coordinate $x$ run along the undeformed centroidal axis of the specimen, from $x=0$ to $x=L$. The transverse deflection is $v(x)$. The boundary conditions are:\n1. At $x=0$, the deflection is zero: $v(0) = 0$.\n2. At $x=0$, the end section is parallel to its original orientation, so the slope is zero: $\\frac{dv}{dx}(0) = 0$.\n3. At $x=L$, the deflection is the enforced eccentricity: $v(L) = e$.\n4. At $x=L$, the end section is also parallel to its original orientation, so the slope is zero: $\\frac{dv}{dx}(L) = 0$.\n\nFor Euler-Bernoulli beam theory with no transverse distributed load, the governing differential equation is:\n$$\nEI \\frac{d^4v}{dx^4} = 0\n$$\nwhere $E$ is Young's modulus and $I$ is the second moment of area about the bending axis.

Geometry (Radius and Length)**\nFor a single test, any error in the initial measurement of a parameter like radius or length is fixed. Thus, both the systematic (calibration) and random (repeatability) uncertainties of the metrology instrument contribute to the systematic uncertainty budget for this specific test.\n\n- **Radius ($r$):** The shear modulus $G$ is proportional to $r^{-4}$. The sensitivity coefficient is $\\frac{r}{G} \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial r} = -4$.\nThe total standard uncertainty for the radius measurement is $u_r = \\sqrt{(u_r^{\\mathrm{sys}})^2 + (u_r^{\\mathrm{rand}})^2} = \\sqrt{(5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m})^2 + (1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m})^2} = \\sqrt{26}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} \\approx 5.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe relative uncertainty in radius is $\\frac{u_r}{r} = \\frac{5.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{5000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 0.00102 = 0.102\\%$.\nThe relative uncertainty contribution to $G$ is $|-4| \\times \\frac{u_r}{r} = 4 \\times 0.102\\% = 0.408\\%$. This entire contribution is systematic for this single test. The source of this uncertainty is predominantly the systematic part of the micrometer calibration ($5\\,\\mu$m vs $1\\,\\mu$m).\n\n- **Length ($L$):** The shear modulus $G$ is proportional to $L^1$. The sensitivity coefficient is $1$.\nThe uncertainty is purely systematic: $u_L = u_L^{\\mathrm{sys}} = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\nThe relative uncertainty in length is $\\frac{u_L}{L} = \\frac{0.02\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{50.00\\,\\mathrm{mm}} = 0.0004 = 0.04\\%$.\nThe relative uncertainty contribution to $G$ is $1 \\times 0.04\\% = 0.04\\%$. This is systematic.\n\n- **Total Geometry Contribution:** Combining the systematic contributions from radius and length in quadrature (assuming they are uncorrelated):\n$u_{\\mathrm{geom}}^{\\mathrm{sys}}/G = \\sqrt{(0.408\\%)^2 + (0.04\\%)^2} \\approx \\sqrt{0.166\\%^2 + 0.0016\\%^2} \\approx 0.41\\%$.\nThis result is clearly dominated by the systematic uncertainty in the radius measurement. The classification is **mostly systematic** with a magnitude of approximately **$0.4\\%$ to $0.5\\%$**.\n\n**2. Alignment/Compliance**\nThis term refers to the systematic effect of the machine stiffness $K_m$. If one were to naively calculate the shear modulus using the total measured angle $\\phi$ instead of the true specimen angle $\\phi_s$, the result would be biased. The erroneously calculated shear modulus, $G_{\\mathrm{raw}}$, would be:\n$$ G_{\\mathrm{raw}} = \\frac{2TL}{\\pi r^4 \\phi} $$\nThe ratio of the raw to the true modulus is:\n$$ \\frac{G_{\\mathrm{raw}}}{G} = \\frac{\\phi - T/K_m}{\\phi} = 1 - \\frac{T}{K_m \\phi} $$\nThe relative error, or bias, is $\\frac{G_{\\mathrm{raw}}-G}{G} = -\\frac{T}{K_m \\phi}$.\nPlugging in the values from the operating point:\n$$ \\text{Bias} = -\\frac{3.14\\,\\mathrm{N\\,m}}{(1.0 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{N\\,m/rad})(0.020\\,\\mathrm{rad})} = -\\frac{3.14}{2000} = -0.00157 = -0.157\\% $$\nThis is a **systematic downward bias** of magnitude **$\\approx 0.16\\%$**.\n\n**3. Torque Calibration**\nThis refers to the systematic component of the torque measurement uncertainty. The problem gives this as $\\pm 0.25\\%$ of reading. The sensitivity of $G$ to $T$ must be calculated.\n$$ \\ln G = \\ln(2) + \\ln T + \\ln L - \\ln(\\pi) - 4\\ln r - \\ln(\\phi - T/K_m) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial(\\ln G)}{\\partial T} = \\frac{1}{T} - \\frac{-1/K_m}{\\phi - T/K_m} = \\frac{1}{T} + \\frac{1}{K_m \\phi - T} $$\nThe sensitivity coefficient is $c_T = T \\frac{\\partial(\\ln G)}{\\partial T} = 1 + \\frac{T}{K_m \\phi - T}$.\n$$ c_T = 1 + \\frac{3.14}{(1.0 \\times 10^5)(0.020) - 3.14} = 1 + \\frac{3.14}{1996.86} \\approx 1 + 0.00157 = 1.00157 $$\nThe sensitivity is very close to $1$. Therefore, the relative uncertainty in torque propagates almost directly to the relative uncertainty in $G$.\nThe contribution from torque calibration is **systematic** and has a magnitude of approximately $1.00157 \\times 0.25\\% \\approx \\mathbf{0.25\\%}$.\n\n**4. Angle Measurement**\nThis source has both systematic and random components.\n- **Systematic Contribution:** The scale-factor uncertainty is given as $\\pm 0.05\\%$ of reading. We must calculate the sensitivity of $G$ to $\\phi$.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial(\\ln G)}{\\partial \\phi} = -\\frac{1}{\\phi - T/K_m} $$\nThe sensitivity coefficient is $c_\\phi = \\phi \\frac{\\partial(\\ln G)}{\\partial \\phi} = -\\frac{\\phi}{\\phi - T/K_m} = -\\frac{\\phi}{\\phi_s}$.\n$$ c_\\phi = -\\frac{0.020}{0.020 - 3.14/10^5} \\approx -1.00157 $$\nThe magnitude of the sensitivity is very close to $1$. The systematic relative uncertainty contribution is $|c_\\phi| \\times 0.05\\% \\approx 1.00157 \\times 0.05\\% \\approx \\mathbf{0.05\\%}$. This is **systematic**.\n\n- **Random Contribution:** For a single test, the \"random\" uncertainties are those that cause fluctuations during the measurement process. These are the torque noise and the angle quantization.\n    - Torque noise contribution: The random uncertainty in torque is $0.02\\%$ of reading. Its contribution to the random uncertainty in $G$ is $|c_T| \\times 0.02\\% \\approx 1.00157 \\times 0.02\\% \\approx 0.020\\%$.\n    - Angle quantization contribution: The resolution is $\\Delta \\phi_{\\mathrm{res}} = 5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{rad}$. Modeling this as a uniform distribution, the standard uncertainty is $u_\\phi^{\\mathrm{rand}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\phi_{\\mathrm{res}}}{\\sqrt{12}} \\approx 1.44 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{rad}$.\n    The relative uncertainty in the angle measurement is $\\frac{u_\\phi^{\\mathrm{rand}}}{\\phi} = \\frac{1.44 \\times 10^{-6}}{0.020} = 7.2 \\times 10^{-5} = 0.0072\\%$.\n    Its contribution to the random uncertainty in $G$ is $|c_\\phi| \\times 0.0072\\% \\approx 1.00157 \\times 0.0072\\% \\approx 0.0072\\%$.\n- **Total Random Contribution:** As the question groups all random effects under the \"angle\" measurement category in the answer options, we combine the random effects from both torque and angle measurement in quadrature:\n$u_{\\mathrm{rand}}/G = \\sqrt{(0.020\\%)^2 + (0.0072\\%)^2} \\approx \\sqrt{0.0004 + 0.000052}\\% \\approx \\sqrt{0.000452}\\% \\approx 0.021\\%$.\nThis total random contribution is **$\\approx 0.02\\%$ to $0.03\\%$**.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\nLet us compare our calculated contributions to the provided options.\n- **A.

For a wave propagating in the negative $z$-direction (reflected wave), $\\dot{\\theta}(t) = C_t \\kappa(t)$. Expressing $\\kappa$ in terms of surface shear strain:\n$$ \\dot{\\theta}_{I,T}(t) = -C_t \\frac{\\gamma_{I,T}(t)}{r_b} $$\n$$ \\dot{\\theta}_R(t) = C_t \\frac{\\gamma_R(t)}{r_b} $$\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Specimen Stress and Strain**\n\nThe average engineering shear strain rate in the specimen, $\\dot{\\gamma}_s(t)$, is determined by the relative angular velocity of its two faces divided by its length $L_s$, scaled by the specimen radius $r_s$. The input face (interface $1$) has angular velocity $\\dot{\\theta}_1(t) = \\dot{\\theta}_I(t) + \\dot{\\theta}_R(t)$, and the output face (interface $2$) has angular velocity $\\dot{\\theta}_2(t) = \\dot{\\theta}_T(t)$.\nThe kinematic relation is:\n$$ \\dot{\\gamma}_s(t) = \\frac{r_s}{L_s} (\\dot{\\theta}_1(t) - \\dot{\\theta}_2(t)) = \\frac{r_s}{L_s} (\\dot{\\theta}_I(t) + \\dot{\\theta}_R(t) - \\dot{\\theta}_T(t)) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for angular velocities in terms of shear strains:\n$$ \\dot{\\gamma}_s(t) = \\frac{r_s}{L_s} \\left( -C_t \\frac{\\gamma_I(t)}{r_b} + C_t \\frac{\\gamma_R(t)}{r_b} - \\left(-C_t \\frac{\\gamma_T(t)}{r_b}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{C_t r_s}{r_b L_s} (\\gamma_R(t) - \\gamma_I(t) + \\gamma_T(t)) $$\nThe specimen shear strain $\\gamma_s(t)$ is obtained by integrating the strain rate from time $t = -\\infty$ (before the pulse arrives):\n$$ \\gamma_s(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} \\dot{\\gamma}_s(\\tau) \\, d\\tau = \\frac{C_t r_s}{r_b L_s} \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} (\\gamma_R(\\tau) - \\gamma_I(\\tau) + \\gamma_T(\\tau)) \\, d\\tau $$\nThis is the required expression for the specimen outer-fiber engineering shear strain.\n\nThe shear stress in the specimen, $\\tau_s(t)$, is calculated from the torque transmitted through it. Standard practice in SHTB analysis is to use the torque measured in the output bar, $T_{\\text{out}}(t)$, as it is generally considered a more reliable measure of the torque sustained by the specimen, especially if the specimen material exhibits strain hardening or softening. The torque at the output face is equal to the transmitted torque, $T_{\\text{out}}(t) = T_T(t)$. The stress at the outer fiber of the specimen is given by the torsion formula:\n$$ \\tau_s(t) = \\frac{T_{\\text{out}}(t) r_s}{J_s} = \\frac{T_T(t) r_s}{J_s} $$\nSubstituting the expression for transmitted torque in terms of the transmitted strain wave:\n$$ \\tau_s(t) = \\left( \\frac{G_b J_b}{r_b} \\gamma_T(t) \\right) \\frac{r_s}{J_s} = \\frac{G_b J_b r_s}{J_s r_b} \\gamma_T(t) $$\nUsing the given formulas for the polar second moments of area, $J_b = \\frac{\\pi r_b^4}{2}$ and $J_s = \\frac{\\pi r_s^4}{2}$:\n$$ \\tau_s(t) = \\frac{G_b (\\pi r_b^4 / 2) r_s}{(\\pi r_s^4 / 2) r_b} \\gamma_T(t) = G_b \\left(\\frac{r_b}{r_s}\\right)^3 \\gamma_T(t) $$\nThis is the required expression for the specimen outer-fiber shear stress.\n\n**Part 2: Parametric Representation of the Stress-Strain Curve**\n\nThe problem provides specific functional forms for the strain waveforms:\n$\\gamma_I(t) = A \\exp\\!\\left(-\\dfrac{(t - t_0)^2}{2 s^2}\\right)$, $\\gamma_R(t) = -\\beta \\gamma_I(t)$, and $\\gamma_T(t) = (1 - \\beta + \\varepsilon) \\gamma_I(t)$.\nWe substitute these into the derived expressions for $\\tau_s(t)$ and $\\gamma_s(t)$.\n\nFor the stress:\n$$ \\tau_s(t) = G_b \\left(\\frac{r_b}{r_s}\\right)^3 (1 - \\beta + \\varepsilon) \\gamma_I(t) $$\n$$ \\tau_s(t) = G_b \\left(\\frac{r_b}{r_s}\\right)^3 (1 - \\beta + \\varepsilon) A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(t - t_0)^2}{2 s^2}\\right) $$\nFor the strain, we first simplify the combination of strain terms:\n$$ \\gamma_R(t) - \\gamma_I(t) + \\gamma_T(t) = -\\beta \\gamma_I(t) - \\gamma_I(t) + (1 - \\beta + \\varepsilon) \\gamma_I(t) = (- \\beta - 1 + 1 - \\beta + \\varepsilon) \\gamma_I(t) = (\\varepsilon - 2\\beta) \\gamma_I(t) $$\nSo, the strain rate is $\\dot{\\gamma}_s(t) = \\frac{C_t r_s}{r_b L_s} (\\varepsilon - 2\\beta) \\gamma_I(t)$. Then the strain is:\n$$ \\gamma_s(t) = \\frac{C_t r_s}{r_b L_s} (\\varepsilon - 2\\beta) \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} \\gamma_I(\\tau) \\, d\\tau $$\n$$ \\gamma_s(t) = \\frac{C_t r_s}{r_b L_s} (\\varepsilon - 2\\beta) \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\tau - t_0)^2}{2 s^2}\\right) d\\tau $$\nThe integral can be expressed using the error function, $\\text{erf}(x) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\int_0^x e^{-u^2}du$. A standard result for the integral of a Gaussian function is $\\int_{-\\infty}^x e^{-t^2/(2\\sigma^2)} dt = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} [1 + \\text{erf}(\\frac{x}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}})]$. With our parameters, this becomes:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\tau - t_0)^2}{2 s^2}\\right) d\\tau = A s \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\left[1 + \\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{t - t_0}{s\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\right] $$\nThus, the parametric expression for strain is:\n$$ \\gamma_s(t) = \\frac{C_t r_s}{r_b L_s} (\\varepsilon - 2\\beta) A s \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\left[1 + \\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{t - t_0}{s\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\right] $$\nThe pair of equations for $\\tau_s(t)$ and $\\gamma_s(t)$ constitutes the parametric representation of the stress-strain curve with time $t$ as the parameter.\n\n**Part 3: Evaluation of the Equilibrium Error Metric $\\mathcal{E}$**\n\nThe equilibrium error metric is defined as:\n$$ \\mathcal{E} \\equiv \\left[ \\dfrac{\\displaystyle \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( T_{\\text{in}}(t) - T_{\\text{out}}(t) \\right)^{2} \\, dt}{\\displaystyle \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( T_{\\text{out}}(t) \\right)^{2} \\, dt} \\right]^{1/2} $$\nThe torque applied to the specimen from the input bar is $T_{\\text{in}}(t) = T_I(t) + T_R(t)$. The torque transmitted into the output bar is $T_{\\text{out}}(t) = T_T(t)$.\nUsing the torque-strain relation, we have:\n$$ T_{\\text{in}}(t) = \\frac{G_b J_b}{r_b} (\\gamma_I(t) + \\gamma_R(t)) = \\frac{G_b J_b}{r_b} (\\gamma_I(t) - \\beta \\gamma_I(t)) = \\frac{G_b J_b}{r_b} (1 - \\beta) \\gamma_I(t) $$\n$$ T_{\\text{out}}(t) = \\frac{G_b J_b}{r_b} \\gamma_T(t) = \\frac{G_b J_b}{r_b} (1 - \\beta + \\varepsilon) \\gamma_I(t) $$\nThe difference in torques is:\n$$ T_{\\text{in}}(t) - T_{\\text{out}}(t) = \\frac{G_b J_b}{r_b} [(1-\\beta) - (1-\\beta+\\varepsilon)] \\gamma_I(t) = -\\varepsilon \\frac{G_b J_b}{r_b} \\gamma_I(t) $$\nNow we substitute these expressions into the definition of $\\mathcal{E}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{E}^2 = \\frac{\\displaystyle \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( -\\varepsilon \\frac{G_b J_b}{r_b} \\gamma_I(t) \\right)^{2} \\, dt}{\\displaystyle \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( (1 - \\beta + \\varepsilon) \\frac{G_b J_b}{r_b} \\gamma_I(t) \\right)^{2} \\, dt} $$\nThe constant factor $(\\frac{G_b J_b}{r_b})^2$ and the integral $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\gamma_I(t)^2 \\, dt$ cancel from the numerator and denominator.\n$$ \\mathcal{E}^2 = \\frac{(-\\varepsilon)^2}{(1 - \\beta + \\varepsilon)^2} = \\frac{\\varepsilon^2}{(1 - \\beta + \\varepsilon)^2} $$\nTaking the square root gives the error metric $\\mathcal{E}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{E} = \\left| \\frac{\\varepsilon}{1 - \\beta + \\varepsilon} \\right| $$\nWe are given $\\beta = 0.40$ and $\\varepsilon = 0.050$.\n$$ \\mathcal{E} = \\frac{0.050}{1 - 0.40 + 0.050} = \\frac{0.050}{0.650} = \\frac{5}{65} = \\frac{1}{13} $$\nTo find the numerical value, we perform the division:\n$$ \\mathcal{E} = \\frac{1}{13} \\approx 0.07692307... $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we get $\\mathcal{E} = 0.07692$.\nThis value represents the root-mean-square error in torque equilibrium, normalized by the root-mean-square of the transmitted torque.
