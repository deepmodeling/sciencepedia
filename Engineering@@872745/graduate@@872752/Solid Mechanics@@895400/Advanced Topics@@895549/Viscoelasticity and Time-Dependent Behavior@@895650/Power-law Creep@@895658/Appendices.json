It presents a standard exercise in dimensional analysis as applied to a fundamental constitutive model in solid mechanics, specifically Norton's power-law for creep. The problem is valid, and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe task is to determine the SI base-unit exponents of the material parameter $A$ in the power-law creep equation. The principle of dimensional homogeneity is the cornerstone of the solution. This principle dictates that any physically meaningful equation must have identical dimensions on both sides of the equality.\n\nThe given constitutive equation is:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon}_{c} = A\\,\\sigma^{n} $$\nwhere $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{c}$ is the uniaxial creep strain rate, $\\sigma$ is the uniaxial Cauchy stress, $A$ is the material parameter, and $n$ is the stress exponent.\n\nLet $[X]$ denote the dimensions of a physical quantity $X$.

Strain, $\\epsilon$, is defined as a dimensionless kinematic quantity, representing a ratio of lengths (e.g., change in length divided by original length). Therefore, its dimension is unity:\n$$ [\\epsilon] = 1 $$\nThe strain rate is the time derivative of strain, $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{c} = \\frac{d\\epsilon_{c}}{dt}$. The dimensions of the strain rate are thus the dimensions of strain divided by the dimension of time:\n$$ [\\dot{\\epsilon}_{c}] = \\frac{[\\epsilon_{c}]}{[t]} = \\frac{1}{T} = T^{-1} $$\n\nNext, consider the Cauchy stress, $\\sigma$. Stress is defined fundamentally as force per unit area:\n$$ [\\sigma] = \\frac{[\\text{Force}]}{[\\text{Area}]} $$\nThe dimension of area is length squared:\n$$ [\\text{Area}] = L^{2} $$\nAccording to Newton's second law, force is the product of mass and acceleration ($F=ma$).

The provided fundamental bases are correct principles of kinematics and constitutive modeling. The task is to apply these principles to evaluate standard forms of creep laws. All terms are clearly defined, and the criteria for evaluation are explicit and quantitative. There are no scientific or logical contradictions, missing information, or subjective claims. The problem is a standard exercise in continuum mechanics and materials science.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation and Analysis**\n\nFirst, we address the explanation requested in the problem. A time-independent stress power-law for the creep rate has the general form $\\dot{\\epsilon} = f(\\sigma, T)$. A specific example is the Norton power law, $\\dot{\\epsilon} = A \\sigma^n$, where $A$ is a temperature-dependent coefficient. The problem states that the test is performed at a constant true stress $\\sigma$ and a fixed temperature $T$. Under these conditions, the right-hand side of the equation, $f(\\sigma, T)$, evaluates to a constant value. Let us denote this constant as $\\dot{\\epsilon}_s$.\n\nTherefore, the constitutive law reduces to:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\dot{\\epsilon}_s = \\text{constant} $$\nThe primary creep regime is defined by a decelerating strain rate. Mathematically, this means the rate of change of the strain rate must be negative:\n$$ \\ddot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\frac{d\\dot{\\epsilon}}{dt}  0 $$\nFor the time-independent power law, the second derivative of strain with respect to time is:\n$$ \\ddot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\dot{\\epsilon}_s) = 0 $$\nSince $0$ is not less than $0$, a law that predicts a constant strain rate cannot, by definition, describe a regime where the strain rate is decreasing. It is incapable of capturing the phenomenon of primary creep.\n\nNext, we evaluate each of the provided options against the established criteria.\n\n**A. A time-independent stress power-law rate at fixed $(\\sigma, T)$: $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = K \\,\\sigma^{n} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\dfrac{Q}{R T}\\right)$ with constants $K$, $n$, and $Q$, implying $\\epsilon(t) = K \\,\\sigma^{n} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\dfrac{Q}{R T}\\right) t$.**\n\nLet the constant term be $C = K \\,\\sigma^{n} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\dfrac{Q}{R T}\\right)$. The model is $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = C$.\nThis is precisely the case analyzed above.\n1.  **Primary Creep:** It fails to model primary creep because the strain rate is constant ($\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = C$), not decelerating. The strain is $\\epsilon(t) = C t$ (assuming $\\epsilon(0)=0$), which is linear, not sublinear, growth.\n2.  **Secondary Creep:** It models secondary creep perfectly, as the rate is constant by definition.\nHowever, the model must capture both stages. It fails on the first criterion.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. An additive strain-level combination with a sublinear early-time term and a steady linear term: $\\epsilon(t) = \\alpha(\\sigma, T)\\, t^{1/3} + \\dot{\\epsilon}_{s}(\\sigma, T)\\, t$, where $\\alpha(\\sigma, T)$ and $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{s}(\\sigma, T)$ are nonnegative functions of $\\sigma$ and $T$.**\n\nWe differentiate the strain expression with respect to time to find the strain rate:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\frac{d\\epsilon}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ \\alpha(\\sigma, T) t^{1/3} + \\dot{\\epsilon}_{s}(\\sigma, T) t \\right] $$\nSince $\\sigma$ and $T$ are fixed, $\\alpha(\\sigma, T)$ and $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{s}(\\sigma, T)$ are constants during the test.\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\frac{1}{3} \\alpha(\\sigma, T) t^{-2/3} + \\dot{\\epsilon}_{s}(\\sigma, T) $$\n1.  **Primary Creep:** For early times ($t \\to 0^+$), the term $\\frac{1}{3} \\alpha t^{-2/3}$ is large and decreases as $t$ increases. The second derivative of strain is $\\ddot{\\epsilon}(t) = -\\frac{2}{9} \\alpha t^{-5/3}$. Since $\\alpha \\ge 0$ (and must be positive for primary creep to exist), $\\ddot{\\epsilon}(t)  0$ for $t  0$. This indicates a decelerating strain rate, which is the definition of primary creep. For small $t$, the strain behaves as $\\epsilon(t) \\approx \\alpha t^{1/3}$, which is sublinear growth since the exponent $1/3  1$. This criterion is met.\n2.  **Secondary Creep:** For later times ($t \\to \\infty$), the term $\\frac{1}{3} \\alpha t^{-2/3}$ approaches $0$. The strain rate asymptotically approaches a constant value:\n$$ \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\dot{\\epsilon}_{s}(\\sigma, T) $$\nThis correctly models the steady-state secondary creep regime. This criterion is met.\n3.  **Dimensional Consistency:** Let strain $\\epsilon$ be dimensionless and time $t$ have dimension of time, $[T]$. For the term $\\dot{\\epsilon}_s t$ to be dimensionless, $[\\dot{\\epsilon}_s] = [T]^{-1}$, which is the correct dimension for a strain rate. For the term $\\alpha t^{1/3}$ to be dimensionless, $[\\alpha][t^{1/3}] = 1 \\implies [\\alpha] = [T]^{-1/3}$. The expression is dimensionally consistent.\n4.  **Physical Plausibility:** This form, often called Andrade creep, is a well-established phenomenological law that accurately fits the primary and secondary creep behavior of many metals. The additive combination of a transient term and a steady-state term is a common and plausible modeling strategy.\n\nThis option satisfies all criteria.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. A strain-hardening attenuation of a stress power-law rate with no explicit time dependence: $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = K \\,\\sigma^{n} \\exp\\!\\left(-h\\,\\epsilon(t)\\right)$ with constants $K$, $n$, and $h0$.**\n\nLet $C = K \\sigma^n$. The model is a differential equation: $\\dot{\\epsilon} = C e^{-h\\epsilon}$.\nAs strain $\\epsilon$ increases with time, the exponential term $e^{-h\\epsilon}$ decreases (since $h0$), causing the strain rate $\\dot{\\epsilon}$ to decrease. This represents strain hardening, the physical mechanism behind primary creep.\n1.  **Primary Creep:** The model correctly predicts a decelerating strain rate. This criterion is met.\n2.  **Secondary Creep:** To check the asymptotic behavior, we examine the limit as $t \\to \\infty$. As time progresses, creep strain $\\epsilon$ accumulates and increases. We assume it does not saturate at a finite value. In the limit $\\epsilon(t) \\to \\infty$, the strain rate becomes:\n$$ \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to \\infty} \\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to \\infty} C e^{-h\\epsilon} = 0 $$\nThis model predicts that the creep rate continuously decreases and approaches zero. It does not predict a transition to a non-zero, constant steady-state creep rate. Therefore, it fails to model the secondary creep stage.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. A time-hardening rate that strengthens with time: $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = K \\,\\sigma^{n} \\left[1 + c\\, t^{2/3}\\right]$ with constants $K$, $n$, and $c0$.**\n\nLet $C_1 = K \\sigma^n$. The model is $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = C_1(1 + c t^{2/3})$.\nThe term \"time-hardening\" implies that the material's resistance to flow increases with time, which should lead to a decreasing strain rate. Let us analyze the behavior of the given expression. As time $t$ increases from $0$, the term $c t^{2/3}$ (with $c0$) increases. This means the strain rate $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t)$ increases with time.\n1.  **Primary Creep:** This model predicts an *accelerating* strain rate ($\\ddot{\\epsilon}(t) = C_1 c \\frac{2}{3} t^{-1/3}  0$), which is the opposite of the decelerating rate observed in primary creep.\n2.  **Secondary Creep:** As $t \\to \\infty$, $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) \\to \\infty$. The rate does not approach a constant value. This model describes runaway creep, possibly similar to tertiary creep, but not steady-state creep.\nThis option fails to meet either of the key behavioral criteria. The term \"time-hardening\" is also misused as the behavior is one of softening.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, only option B provides a constitutive form that correctly captures both the decelerating primary creep stage and the asymptotic transition to a constant-rate secondary creep stage, while being dimensionally and physically sound.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2673367"}, {"introduction": "The final stage of creep, the tertiary regime, is characterized by an accelerating strain rate that leads to failure, a critical concern in engineering design.

Proceeding to solution.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\nFrom the given bases, we establish the governing equations.\n1.  **Kinematics and Volume Preservation**: The true strain is $\\varepsilon(t) = \\ln(L(t)/L_0)$. Differentiating with respect to time gives the strain rate $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = \\dot{L}(t)/L(t)$. The volume preservation condition states that $A(t)L(t) = A_0 L_0$ is constant. This implies $A(t) = A_0 (L_0/L(t))$. From the definition of true strain, $L(t)/L_0 = e^{\\varepsilon(t)}$. Therefore, the current area is $A(t) = A_0 e^{-\\varepsilon(t)}$.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium and Stress**: Under a constant axial force $P$, the Cauchy (true) stress is $\\sigma(t) = P/A(t)$. Substituting the expression for $A(t)$, we get:\n    $$ \\sigma(t) = \\frac{P}{A_0 e^{-\\varepsilon(t)}} = \\frac{P}{A_0} e^{\\varepsilon(t)} $$\n    Letting $\\sigma_0 = P/A_0$ be the initial (engineering) stress, we have $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_0 e^{\\varepsilon(t)}$. This shows that in a constant force test, the true stress increases as the material deforms.\n\n3.  **Constitutive Behavior**: The problem states a power-law creep relation. We write this as $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = k\\,\\sigma(t)^n$, where $k$ and $n$ are positive material constants ($k0, n0$).\n    When damage is included, the strain rate is driven by an effective stress $\\tilde{\\sigma}(t)$. Option C suggests a definition based on the effective area, which is standard: $\\tilde\\sigma(t)=P/A_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t) = P/((1-D(t))A(t)) = \\sigma(t)/(1-D(t))$. The constitutive law becomes $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = k\\,\\tilde{\\sigma}(t)^n = k \\left(\\frac{\\sigma(t)}{1-D(t)}\\right)^n$.\n\nTertiary creep is characterized by an accelerating strain rate, meaning $\\ddot{\\varepsilon}(t) = \\frac{d\\dot{\\varepsilon}}{dt}  0$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Under a test in which the axial Cauchy stress $\\sigma$ is externally maintained exactly constant in time, a pure power-law creep model with constant parameters predicts a time-independent $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$ and therefore cannot enter a tertiary stage without additional physics.**\n\n-   **Condition**: The Cauchy stress is held constant, $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{\\text{const}}$.\n-   **Model**: The \"pure power-law creep model\" is $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = k\\,\\sigma(t)^n$.\n-   **Analysis**: If $\\sigma(t)$ is constant, and the parameters $k$ and $n$ are constant, then the strain rate $\\dot{\\varepsilon} = k\\,(\\sigma_{\\text{const}})^n$ must also be constant. This scenario describes secondary, or steady-state, creep. Tertiary creep requires $\\ddot{\\varepsilon}(t)  0$. For a constant $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$, its time derivative $\\ddot{\\varepsilon}$ is exactly $0$. Therefore, this model under this test condition cannot exhibit an accelerating strain rate. To achieve tertiary creep in a constant true stress test, one must introduce additional physical mechanisms not included in the \"pure\" model, such as damage accumulation or dynamic microstructural evolution (e.g., changes in $k$ or $n$ with time or strain).\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Under a constant axial force $P$ with volume-preserving creep kinematics and no damage, geometric evolution alone implies that $\\sigma(t)$ increases with $\\varepsilon(t)$, so a power-law creep model yields an increasing $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)$ that can diverge in finite time.**\n\n-   **Condition**: Constant force $P$, volume-preserving flow, no damage ($D(t)=0$).\n-   **Analysis**: As derived above, $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_0 e^{\\varepsilon(t)}$. Since the specimen is in tension, it elongates, so $\\varepsilon(t)$ increases with time. Consequently, the true stress $\\sigma(t)$ also increases with time.\n-   The strain rate is $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = k\\,\\sigma(t)^n = k\\,(\\sigma_0 e^{\\varepsilon(t)})^n = (k\\,\\sigma_0^n) e^{n\\varepsilon(t)}$.\n-   Since $\\varepsilon(t)$ increases, $e^{n\\varepsilon(t)}$ increases (as $n0$), which means $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)$ increases. An increasing strain rate is, by definition, a form of tertiary creep. This is often called geometric softening.\n-   To check for divergence in finite time, we solve the differential equation $\\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dt} = C e^{n\\varepsilon}$, where $C=k\\,\\sigma_0^n$. Separating variables gives $e^{-n\\varepsilon}d\\varepsilon = C dt$. Integrating from $t=0$ (with $\\varepsilon(0)=0$) to a failure time $t_f$ (at strain $\\varepsilon_f$):\n    $$ \\int_0^{\\varepsilon_f} e^{-n\\varepsilon} d\\varepsilon = \\int_0^{t_f} C dt \\implies \\left[-\\frac{1}{n}e^{-n\\varepsilon}\\right]_0^{\\varepsilon_f} = C t_f $$\n    $$ \\frac{1}{n}(1 - e^{-n\\varepsilon_f}) = C t_f $$\n    The time to rupture (theoretically, infinite strain, $\\varepsilon_f \\to \\infty$) is $t_f = \\lim_{\\varepsilon_f \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{nC}(1 - e^{-n\\varepsilon_f}) = \\frac{1}{nC} = \\frac{1}{n k \\sigma_0^n}$.\n    Since this time is finite and positive, the strain diverges in finite time, leading to rupture.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**C. If isotropic damage is modeled by $D(t)$ reducing the effective area as $A_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t) = \\big(1-D(t)\\big)\\,A(t)$, then the effective stress driving creep increases as $\\tilde{\\sigma}(t) = \\sigma(t)/\\big(1-D(t)\\big)$. If $\\dot{D}(t)0$, this accelerates creep under fixed external force $P$ relative to the no-damage case.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: The definition of effective stress is the force $P$ divided by the effective area $A_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t)$:\n    $$ \\tilde{\\sigma}(t) = \\frac{P}{A_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t)} = \\frac{P}{(1-D(t))A(t)} = \\frac{1}{1-D(t)} \\left(\\frac{P}{A(t)}\\right) = \\frac{\\sigma(t)}{1-D(t)} $$\n    This confirms the first part of the statement. The constitutive law is $\\dot{\\varepsilon} = k\\,\\tilde{\\sigma}^n$.\n    -   In the no-damage case ($D=0$): $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\text{no-damage}} = k\\,\\sigma(t)^n$.\n    -   In the damage case ($D0$): $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\text{damage}} = k\\left(\\frac{\\sigma(t)}{1-D(t)}\\right)^n = (k\\,\\sigma(t)^n) \\frac{1}{(1-D(t))^n}$.\n    So, $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\text{damage}} = \\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\text{no-damage}} \\cdot (1-D(t))^{-n}$.\n    If damage accumulates, $\\dot{D}(t)0$, then $D(t)$ increases from $0$. Since $D(t) \\in [0,1)$ and $n0$, the factor $(1-D(t))^{-n}$ is always greater than $1$ for $D0$ and increases as $D$ increases. This means that at any given Cauchy stress $\\sigma(t)$, the presence of damage increases the strain rate. This effect combines with the geometric effect (increasing $\\sigma(t)$) to produce even more rapid acceleration. The statement is a correct description of the role of damage.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Tertiary creep driven by necking can be captured by a pure power-law creep relation in small-strain geometry (i.e., without accounting for evolving cross-section) simply by choosing an exponent $n1$.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: The \"small-strain geometry\" assumption implies that changes in the cross-sectional area are negligible, so $A(t) \\approx A_0$. Under a constant force $P$, this means the stress is approximately constant: $\\sigma(t) \\approx P/A_0 = \\sigma_0$.\n-   With a constant stress, the pure power-law relation $\\dot{\\varepsilon} = k\\,\\sigma^n$ yields a constant strain rate: $\\dot{\\varepsilon} \\approx k\\,\\sigma_0^n = \\text{constant}$.\n-   This is secondary creep, not tertiary creep ($\\ddot{\\varepsilon}=0$). The value of the exponent $n$ (whether it is greater than $1$ or not) does not change this conclusion; as long as $n$ is a constant, a constant stress will produce a constant strain rate.\n-   Furthermore, \"necking\" is precisely the geometric instability resulting from the non-uniform reduction of the cross-section, an effect that is explicitly ignored by the \"small-strain geometry\" assumption. The statement is thus self-contradictory.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. If damage is present but the external force $P$ is held constant and the geometry remains uniform (no necking), then the Cauchy stress $\\sigma(t)$ is unaffected by $D(t)$ and tertiary creep cannot occur in a power-law model augmented with the effective area reduction $A_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t) = \\big(1-D(t)\\big)\\,A(t)$.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: This statement contains two claims.\n    1.  \"the Cauchy stress $\\sigma(t)$ is unaffected by $D(t)$\".\n        The evolution of strain is given by $\\dot{\\varepsilon} = k (\\frac{\\sigma(t)}{1-D(t)})^n$. Since $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_0 e^{\\varepsilon(t)}$, this becomes $\\dot{\\varepsilon} = k (\\frac{\\sigma_0 e^{\\varepsilon(t)}}{1-D(t)})^n$. The rate of strain accumulation, $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$, clearly depends on the damage $D(t)$. Therefore, the integrated strain $\\varepsilon(t)$ depends on the history of damage. Since the Cauchy stress $\\sigma(t)$ is an explicit function of $\\varepsilon(t)$, its time evolution is also affected by $D(t)$. The claim is false.\n    2.  \"tertiary creep cannot occur\".\n        Tertiary creep is an accelerating strain rate, $\\ddot{\\varepsilon}0$. Let's compute the acceleration.\n        $\\dot{\\varepsilon} = k \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_0 e^{\\varepsilon}}{1-D} \\right)^n$. Taking the logarithm: $\\ln(\\dot{\\varepsilon}) = \\ln(k\\,\\sigma_0^n) + n\\varepsilon - n\\ln(1-D)$.\n        Differentiating with respect to time gives:\n        $$ \\frac{\\ddot{\\varepsilon}}{\\dot{\\varepsilon}} = n\\dot{\\varepsilon} - n \\frac{-\\dot{D}}{1-D} = n\\dot{\\varepsilon} + \\frac{n\\dot{D}}{1-D} $$\n        $$ \\ddot{\\varepsilon} = \\dot{\\varepsilon} \\left( n\\dot{\\varepsilon} + \\frac{n\\dot{D}}{1-D} \\right) $$\n        Since the bar is in tension, $\\dot{\\varepsilon}0$. The material constants $k,n$ are positive. By premise, damage is present, so we assume it accumulates, $\\dot{D}0$. Given $D \\in [0,1)$, all terms in the expression for $\\ddot{\\varepsilon}$ are positive. Thus, $\\ddot{\\varepsilon}  0$. Tertiary creep not only can occur, it is guaranteed by the combined effects of geometric softening and damage accumulation. This claim is also false.\n-   Since both claims are false, the statement is incorrect.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "2673385"}]}
