It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and all terms are formally defined. Therefore, I will proceed with its solution.\n\nThe core of the task is to apply the elastic-viscoelastic correspondence principle (EVCP). This principle dictates that we first solve the equivalent linear elastic problem and then, through a set of formal substitutions, obtain the solution for the linear viscoelastic problem in the Laplace domain.\n\nThe elastic problem is the classic Lamé problem for a thick-walled cylinder under internal pressure $p_0$ and the plane strain condition $\\varepsilon_{zz}=0$.\n\nThe governing equations for the elastic problem are as follows:\n\n$1$. Equilibrium in cylindrical coordinates, assuming axisymmetry and no body forces:\n$$ \\frac{d\\sigma_{rr}}{dr} + \\frac{\\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}}{r} = 0 $$\n\n$2$.

Isotropic linear elastic constitutive relations:\nThe stress components are related to the strain components. For plane strain ($\\varepsilon_{zz} = 0$), the relevant relations are:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr} = (\\lambda + 2G)\\varepsilon_{rr} + \\lambda\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = \\lambda\\varepsilon_{rr} + (\\lambda + 2G)\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta} $$\nwhere $\\lambda$ and $G$ are the Lamé parameters. $G$ is the shear modulus, and $\\lambda$ is related to the bulk modulus $K$ and shear modulus $G$ by $\\lambda = K - \\frac{2}{3}G$.\n\nFirst, we solve for the stress field. The stress distribution for this problem is statically determinate, meaning it can be found from the equilibrium equation and stress boundary conditions alone, without recourse to material properties. The general solution to the equilibrium equation is of the form:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr}(r) = C_1 - \\frac{C_2}{r^2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r) = C_1 + \\frac{C_2}{r^2} $$\nThe constants of integration $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined from the boundary conditions on stress. For the elastic problem, let the internal pressure be a constant $p_0$. With the sign convention that tensile stress is positive, the boundary conditions are:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr}(r=a) = -p_0 $$\n$$ \\sigma_{rr}(r=b) = 0 $$\n\nApplying these conditions:\n$$ C_1 - \\frac{C_2}{a^2} = -p_0 $$\n$$ C_1 - \\frac{C_2}{b^2} = 0 $$\n\nSolving this system of linear equations for $C_1$ and $C_2$ yields:\n$$ C_1 = \\frac{p_0 a^2}{b^2 - a^2} $$\n$$ C_2 = \\frac{p_0 a^2 b^2}{b^2 - a^2} $$\n\nSubstituting these constants back into the general solution gives the elastic stress field:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr,el}(r) = \\frac{p_0 a^2}{b^2 - a^2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{b^2}{r^2} \\right) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta,el}(r) = \\frac{p_0 a^2}{b^2 - a^2} \\left( 1 + \\frac{b^2}{r^2} \\right) $$\n\nNext, we determine the displacement field $u_{el}(r)$. This requires the constitutive law. We can express the strains in terms of stresses. For an isotropic material, the strain difference is related to the stress difference through the shear modulus $G$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta} - \\varepsilon_{rr} = \\frac{1}{2G}(\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} - \\sigma_{rr}) $$\nSubstituting the kinematic relations and the stress solutions:\n$$ \\frac{u}{r} - \\frac{du}{dr} = \\frac{1}{2G} \\left( \\left(C_1 + \\frac{C_2}{r^2}\\right) - \\left(C_1 - \\frac{C_2}{r^2}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{C_2}{G r^2} $$\nThis is equivalent to $-\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(\\frac{u}{r}\\right) = \\frac{C_2}{G r^3}$, which is not the most direct route.\n\nA more direct method is to relate strain components to the displacement general solution $u(r) = D_1 r + D_2/r$. This form satisfies the Navier-Cauchy equation for this geometry. The strains are $\\varepsilon_{rr} = D_1 - D_2/r^2$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = D_1 + D_2/r^2$.\nSubstituting into the constitutive law for plane strain gives:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr} = (\\lambda + 2G)(D_1 - D_2/r^2) + \\lambda(D_1 + D_2/r^2) = 2(\\lambda+G)D_1 - 2G\\frac{D_2}{r^2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = \\lambda(D_1 - D_2/r^2) + (\\lambda + 2G)(D_1 + D_2/r^2) = 2(\\lambda+G)D_1 + 2G\\frac{D_2}{r^2} $$\nComparing these with the general stress solution $\\sigma_{rr} = C_1 - C_2/r^2$ and $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = C_1 + C_2/r^2$, we identify:\n$$ C_1 = 2(\\lambda+G)D_1 $$\n$$ C_2 = 2G D_2 $$\nFrom this, we solve for the displacement coefficients $D_1$ and $D_2$:\n$$ D_1 = \\frac{C_1}{2(\\lambda+G)}, \\quad D_2 = \\frac{C_2}{2G} $$\nThe elastic displacement field is thus:\n$$ u_{el}(r) = \\frac{C_1}{2(\\lambda+G)} r + \\frac{C_2}{2G} \\frac{1}{r} $$\nThe problem specifies material properties in terms of bulk modulus $K$ and shear modulus $G$. We use the relation $\\lambda = K - \\frac{2}{3}G$. Therefore, the denominator term becomes $2(\\lambda+G) = 2(K - \\frac{2}{3}G + G) = 2(K + \\frac{1}{3}G)$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n$$ u_{el}(r) = \\frac{p_0 a^2}{b^2-a^2} \\left[ \\frac{r}{2(K + \\frac{1}{3}G)} + \\frac{b^2}{2Gr} \\right] $$\nThis can be written as:\n$$ u_{el}(r) = \\frac{p_0 a^2}{2(b^2 - a^2)} \\left( \\frac{r}{K + \\frac{1}{3}G} + \\frac{b^2}{rG} \\right) $$\n\nNow we apply the EVCP. The Laplace transform of the viscoelastic solution is obtained by replacing the elastic constants with their corresponding Laplace-domain operators, and the time-dependent loading with its Laplace transform. In this case, the substitutions are:\n$$ p_0 \\rightarrow P(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{p(t)\\} $$\n$$ K \\rightarrow K_s(s) $$\n$$ G \\rightarrow G_s(s) $$\nThe geometric factors $r$, $a$, $b$ are unchanged.\n\nApplying these substitutions to the elastic solutions for stress and displacement yields the Laplace transforms of the viscoelastic fields.\n\nFor the stress fields, since the elastic expressions are independent of material properties, so are their viscoelastic counterparts in the Laplace domain:\n$$ \\Sigma_{rr}(r,s) = \\frac{P(s) a^2}{b^2 - a^2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{b^2}{r^2} \\right) $$\n$$ \\Sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r,s) = \\frac{P(s) a^2}{b^2 - a^2} \\left( 1 + \\frac{b^2}{r^2} \\right) $$\n\nFor the displacement field, the moduli are present, so the substitution yields:\n$$ u_s(r,s) = \\frac{P(s) a^2}{2(b^2 - a^2)} \\left( \\frac{r}{K_s(s) + \\frac{1}{3}G_s(s)} + \\frac{b^2}{r G_s(s)} \\right) $$\n\nThese are the required closed-form expressions. The question requires the final answer to be presented as a single row matrix containing $u_s(r,s)$, $\\Sigma_{rr}(r,s)$, and $\\Sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r,s)$ in this specific order.\n\nThe expressions are:\n$1$. $u_s(r,s) = \\frac{P(s) a^2}{2(b^2-a^2)} \\left( \\frac{r}{K_s(s) + \\frac{1}{3}G_s(s)} + \\frac{b^2}{r G_s(s)} \\right)$\n$2$. $\\Sigma_{rr}(r,s) = \\frac{P(s) a^2}{b^2-a^2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{b^2}{r^2} \\right)$\n$3$. $\\Sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r,s) = \\frac{P(s) a^2}{b^2-a^2} \\left( 1 + \\frac{b^2}{r^2} \\right)$\n\nThis concludes the derivation.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{P(s) a^2}{2(b^2-a^2)} \\left( \\frac{r}{K_s(s) + \\frac{1}{3}G_s(s)} + \\frac{b^2}{r G_s(s)} \\right) & \\frac{P(s) a^2}{b^2-a^2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{b^2}{r^2} \\right) & \\frac{P(s) a^2}{b^2-a^2} \\left( 1 + \\frac{b^2}{r^2} \\right) \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "2634927"}, {"introduction": "We now shift focus from a boundary value problem to the material model itself, using the Standard Linear Solid (SLS) as a case study.

This principle allows us to replace the constitutive laws in the time domain with algebraic relations in the frequency domain, where mechanical elements are described by their complex moduli. We represent time-harmonic quantities using complex exponentials, e.g., $\\gamma(t) = \\gamma^{*} \\exp(i\\omega t)$, where $\\gamma^{*}$ is the complex strain amplitude. The complex shear modulus $G^{*}(\\omega)$ is defined by the relation $\\sigma^{*}(\\omega) = G^{*}(\\omega)\\gamma^{*}(\\omega)$, where $\\sigma^{*}$ is the complex stress amplitude.\n\nFirst, we define the complex moduli for the basic components:\n1.  A linear elastic spring with shear modulus $G$ has a stress-strain relation $\\sigma(t) = G \\gamma(t)$. In the frequency domain, this is $\\sigma^{*} = G \\gamma^{*}$, so its complex modulus is $G_{spring}^{*} = G$.\n2.  A linear viscous dashpot with viscosity $\\eta$ has a stress-strain rate relation $\\sigma(t) = \\eta \\frac{d\\gamma}{dt}$. For a harmonic strain $\\gamma(t) = \\gamma^{*} \\exp(i \\omega t)$, the strain rate is $\\frac{d\\gamma}{dt} = i\\omega \\gamma^{*} \\exp(i\\omega t)$. Thus, the stress is $\\sigma(t) = i\\omega\\eta \\gamma^{*} \\exp(i \\omega t)$, and the complex stress amplitude is $\\sigma^{*} = i\\omega\\eta \\gamma^{*}$. The complex modulus of the dashpot is $G_{dashpot}^{*} = i\\omega\\eta$.\n\nNext, we apply the composition rules for elements in series and parallel.\nFor elements in series, the stress is the same across all elements, and the total strain is the sum of the individual strains. This implies that their complex compliances, $J^{*} = 1/G^{*}$, add.\n$$ \\frac{1}{G_{series}^{*}} = \\sum_{k} \\frac{1}{G_{k}^{*}} $$\nFor elements in parallel, the strain is the same for all elements, and the total stress is the sum of the individual stresses.

The term $G'(\\omega)\\gamma_{0}\\sin(\\omega t)$ is perfectly **in-phase** with the applied strain $\\gamma(t) = \\gamma_{0}\\sin(\\omega t)$. This component of the stress represents the elastic response of the material. $G'(\\omega)$, the storage modulus, is the amplitude of the in-phase stress per unit strain amplitude. It quantifies the energy stored in the material during a deformation cycle and subsequently recovered.\n2.  The term $G''(\\omega)\\gamma_{0}\\cos(\\omega t)$ is **out-of-phase** with the applied strain by a quarter cycle, or $\\pi/2$ radians (since $\\cos(\\theta) = \\sin(\\theta + \\pi/2)$). This component of the stress represents the viscous response. $G''(\\omega)$, the loss modulus, is the amplitude of the out-of-phase stress per unit strain amplitude. It quantifies the energy dissipated, typically as heat, during a deformation cycle.\n\nThe total stress response can also be written as a single sinusoid with a phase lead $\\delta$ relative to the strain:\n$$ \\sigma(t) = A\\sin(\\omega t + \\delta) $$\nwhere the amplitude is $A = \\gamma_{0}\\sqrt{(G'(\\omega))^{2} + (G''(\\omega))^{2}} = \\gamma_{0}|G^{*}(\\omega)|$, and the phase angle is $\\delta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{G''(\\omega)}{G'(\\omega)}\\right)$.

Hence $K_s(s) = \\alpha G_s(s)$ is necessary. Therefore, statement A is Correct.\n\nB. “It is sufficient for $\\nu_s(s)$ to be constant that the ratio $K_s(s)/G_s(s)$ tends to the same constant in the limits $s\\to 0^+$ and $s\\to \\infty$, even if $K_s(s)/G_s(s)$ varies for intermediate $s$.”\n\nLet $r(s)=K_s(s)/G_s(s)$. From the formula above,\n$$\n\\nu_s(s) = \\frac{3r(s) - 2}{2(3r(s)+1)}.\n$$\nIf $r(s)$ varies with $s$ on any interval, then $\\nu_s(s)$ varies with $s$ on that interval because the mapping $r\\mapsto \\dfrac{3r-2}{2(3r+1)}$ is strictly monotone for $r>0$. Having matching limits as $s\\to 0^+$ and $s\\to \\infty$ does not freeze the function in between. Therefore, statement B is Incorrect.\n\nC. “If $G(t)$ relaxes faster than $K(t)$, i.e., $\\tau_G < \\tau_K$, and one enforces a constant Poisson’s ratio equal to the instantaneous value at $t=0^+$, then under a sustained uniaxial stress $\\sigma_0$ the predicted magnitude of the lateral strain at intermediate times is underestimated.”\n\nWe analyze the problem in the Laplace domain. Enforcing a constant Poisson's ratio equal to its initial value, $\\nu_c = \\nu(0^+)$, is equivalent to assuming the correspondence moduli are proportional for all $s$: $K_s^{\\mathrm{assm}}(s) = \\alpha G_s(s)$, where $\\alpha = K(0^+)/G(0^+)$.\nThe condition $\\tau_G  \\tau_K$ means that the shear modulus relaxes proportionally more than the bulk modulus. In the s-domain, this implies that the true ratio $r(s) = K_s(s)/G_s(s)$ is not constant. It increases as $s$ decreases from $\\infty$ to $0$, such that $r(s) > r(s\\to\\infty) = \\alpha$ for $s  \\infty$. Therefore, the true bulk modulus $K_s(s)$ is always greater than the assumed one, $K_s(s) > K_s^{\\mathrm{assm}}(s) = \\alpha G_s(s)$.\nThe Laplace transform of the lateral strain under uniaxial step stress $\\sigma_0$ is given by $\\varepsilon_{yy,s}(s) = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{s}\\left(\\frac{1}{9K_s(s)} - \\frac{1}{6G_s(s)}\\right)$. The corresponding strain for the assumed model is $\\varepsilon_{yy,s}^{\\mathrm{assm}}(s) = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{s}\\left(\\frac{1}{9\\alpha G_s(s)} - \\frac{1}{6G_s(s)}\\right)$.\nSince $K_s(s) > \\alpha G_s(s)$, we have $\\frac{1}{K_s(s)}  \\frac{1}{\\alpha G_s(s)}$. Comparing the expressions for the transformed strains, it follows that $\\varepsilon_{yy,s}(s) > \\varepsilon_{yy,s}^{\\mathrm{assm}}(s)$ (the true value is less negative than the assumed one).\nThis relationship is preserved upon inverse Laplace transformation for a step input, so $\\varepsilon_{yy}(t) > \\varepsilon_{yy}^{\\mathrm{assm}}(t)$ for $t>0$. As both strains are negative (contraction), the magnitude of the predicted strain is smaller than the true strain's magnitude: $|\\varepsilon_{yy}^{\\mathrm{assm}}(t)|  |\\varepsilon_{yy}(t)|$. The lateral strain is underestimated. Therefore, statement C is Correct.\n\nD. “Enforcing a constant Poisson’s ratio equal to the long-time value (corresponding to $t\\to\\infty$) guarantees exact axial and lateral strain histories at all times under uniaxial stress, even when $\\tau_G \\neq \\tau_K$.”\n\nFixing $\\nu$ to the long-time value corresponds to choosing $\\alpha_\\infty = K(\\infty)/G(\\infty)$ and enforcing $K_{\\mathrm{assm}}(s)=\\alpha_\\infty G_s(s)$. This construction reproduces the correct long-time limits because $K_{\\mathrm{assm}}(\\infty)=\\alpha_\\infty G(\\infty)=K(\\infty)$ and $G_{\\mathrm{assm}}(\\infty)=G(\\infty)$, so the $t\\to\\infty$ axial and lateral strains are matched. However, for $t$ away from infinity, if $\\tau_G \\neq \\tau_K$ then $K_s(s)/G_s(s)\\neq \\alpha_\\infty$ and the assumed and true moduli differ in their volumetric part. The axial and lateral strain histories depend on both $K_s(s)$ and $G_s(s)$ through\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xx,s}(s) = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{s}\\left(\\frac{1}{9K_s(s)} + \\frac{1}{3G_s(s)}\\right), \\qquad \\varepsilon_{yy,s}(s) = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{s}\\left(\\frac{1}{9K_s(s)} - \\frac{1}{6G_s(s)}\\right),\n$$\nso mismatching $K_s(s)$ except at $s\\to 0$ produces errors at intermediate times. Therefore, the guarantee claimed “at all times” is false. Statement D is Incorrect.\n\nE. “For boundary value problems whose elastic solution is everywhere purely deviatoric (zero hydrostatic stress throughout the body), the constant Poisson’s ratio assumption introduces no error in the viscoelastic stress or strain histories obtained via EVCP.”\n\nIn problems with identically zero hydrostatic stress, $\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})\\equiv 0$ everywhere and at all times, the constitutive response reduces to the deviatoric branch:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_s(s) = \\frac{1}{2G_s(s)}\\, \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_s(s),\n$$\nwith no contribution from $K_s(s)$. Examples include pure shear of a homogeneous block and torsion of a circular cylinder in the Saint-Venant sense. Under EVCP, the viscoelastic solution depends solely on $G_s(s)$, so any assumption about $\\nu_s(s)$ or $K_s(s)$ is inoperative: there is no volumetric response to couple. Therefore, the constant Poisson’s ratio assumption cannot induce an error in such purely deviatoric problems. Statement E is Correct.\n\nSummary:\n- A is Correct (necessary and sufficient proportionality $K_s(s)=\\alpha G_s(s)$).\n- B is Incorrect (matching only limiting ratios does not enforce constancy in between).\n- C is Correct (faster shear relaxation leads to underestimation of lateral contraction if $\\nu$ is fixed at its instantaneous value).\n- D is Incorrect (matching the long-time value does not guarantee exact histories at all times when $\\tau_G\\neq\\tau_K$).\n- E is Correct (purely deviatoric problems depend only on $G_s(s)$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "2634955"}]}
