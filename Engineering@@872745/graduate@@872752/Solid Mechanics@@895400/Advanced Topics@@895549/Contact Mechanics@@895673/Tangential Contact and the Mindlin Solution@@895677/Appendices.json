The material properties are physically realistic. The core task is to compute composite moduli and perform a qualitative analysis based on these theories. The problem contains a minor logical imperfection in its qualitative part: `at fixed normal load (hence fixed $a$), state how increasing $\\nu$ affects...`. For a fixed normal load, the contact radius $a$ is a function of the effective modulus $E^*$, which in turn depends on the Poisson's ratios $\\nu_1$ and $\\nu_2$. Therefore, if $\\nu$ is varied, $a$ is not fixed. This is a flaw. However, the qualitative conclusion is unchanged whether one incorrectly assumes $a$ is fixed or correctly accounts for its dependence on $\\nu$. Thus, this flaw does not invalidate the problem but represents a slight imprecision. The definition of the composite shear modulus $G^*$ is not given by an explicit formula, requiring deduction based on the provided hint (\"combine the two half-space compliances in series\") and consistency with the provided options. This ambiguity is a weakness, but a single interpretation is strongly suggested. The problem is otherwise well-posed and solvable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid, with minor, non-fatal flaws noted. Proceeding to solution.\n\n### Derivation\nThe solution requires the calculation of two composite moduli, $E^*$ and $G^*$, and a qualitative analysis of the initial tangential stiffness.\n\n**Calculation of the Hertz Normal Reduced Modulus, $E^*$**\n\nFor normal contact between two elastic bodies, the compliances add. The compliance of a single half-space is proportional to the factor $(1-\\nu^2)/E$. The effective modulus $E^*$ is defined by summing these compliance factors:\n$$ \\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{1-\\nu_1^2}{E_1} + \\frac{1-\\nu_2^2}{E_2} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$E_1 = 210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $\\nu_1 = 0.30$\n$E_2 = 70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $\\nu_2 = 0.33$\n$$ \\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{1 - (0.30)^2}{210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} + \\frac{1 - (0.33)^2}{70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{1 - 0.09}{210} + \\frac{1 - 0.1089}{70} = \\frac{0.91}{210} + \\frac{0.8911}{70} \\,\\, [\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1}] $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{E^*} \\approx 0.0043333 + 0.01273 \\,\\, [\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1}] = 0.0170633 \\,\\, [\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1}] $$\n$$ E^* = \\frac{1}{0.0170633} \\approx 58.605\\,\\mathrm{GPa} $$\n\n**Calculation of the Mindlin Tangential Composite Shear Modulus, $G^*$**\n\nFor the initial, full-stick tangential contact, the tangential stiffness $S_t$ is given by:\n$$ S_t = \\frac{4a}{\\frac{2-\\nu_1}{G_1} + \\frac{2-\\nu_2}{G_2}} $$\nThis follows from adding the tangential compliances of the two bodies. The problem asks to define a composite modulus $G^*$. The material-dependent part of the total tangential compliance is the term $(\\frac{2-\\nu_1}{G_1} + \\frac{2-\\nu_2}{G_2})$. Following the structure of the definition for $E^*$, it is most logical to define $1/G^*$ to be this collection of material terms, such that the stiffness can be written as $S_t=4aG^*$. While other definitions exist, this interpretation is most consistent with the problem's hint to combine compliances and leads to one of the numerical options.\n$$ \\frac{1}{G^*} = \\frac{2-\\nu_1}{G_1} + \\frac{2-\\nu_2}{G_2} $$\nFirst, we must calculate the shear moduli $G_1$ and $G_2$ from the given Young's moduli and Poisson's ratios using the relation for isotropic elastic materials, $G = E / [2(1+\\nu)]$.\n$$ G_1 = \\frac{E_1}{2(1+\\nu_1)} = \\frac{210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}}{2(1+0.30)} = \\frac{210}{2.6} \\approx 80.769\\,\\mathrm{GPa} $$\n$$ G_2 = \\frac{E_2}{2(1+\\nu_2)} = \\frac{70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}}{2(1+0.33)} = \\frac{70}{2.66} \\approx 26.316\\,\\mathrm{GPa} $$\nNow we substitute these into the expression for $1/G^*$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{G^*} = \\frac{2-0.30}{80.769\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} + \\frac{2-0.33}{26.316\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{G^*} = \\frac{1.70}{80.769} + \\frac{1.67}{26.316} \\,\\, [\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1}] $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{G^*} \\approx 0.021047 + 0.063457 \\,\\, [\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1}] = 0.084504 \\,\\, [\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1}] $$\n$$ G^* = \\frac{1}{0.084504} \\approx 11.834\\,\\mathrm{GPa} $$\n\n**Qualitative Dependence of Initial Tangential Stiffness on $\\nu$**\n\nThe question asks how the initial tangential stiffness $S_t$ changes with increasing $\\nu$ for a material with fixed $E$. The stiffness is inversely proportional to the sum of tangential compliances. The compliance contribution from a single body $i$ is proportional to $(2-\\nu_i)/G_i$. We express this in terms of $E_i$ and $\\nu_i$:\n$$ \\frac{2-\\nu_i}{G_i} = \\frac{2-\\nu_i}{E_i/[2(1+\\nu_i)]} = \\frac{2(2-\\nu_i)(1+\\nu_i)}{E_i} $$\nAt fixed $E_i$, the dependence on $\\nu_i$ is governed by the function $f(\\nu_i) = (2-\\nu_i)(1+\\nu_i) = 2 + \\nu_i - \\nu_i^2$.\nTo find the trend, we take the derivative with respect to $\\nu_i$:\n$$ \\frac{df}{d\\nu_i} = 1 - 2\\nu_i $$\nFor physically realistic materials, $0 \\le \\nu_i \\le 0.5$. In this range, the derivative $1 - 2\\nu_i$ is non-negative (it is zero only at the endpoint $\\nu_i=0.5$). Thus, $f(\\nu_i)$ is an increasing function of $\\nu_i$.\nAn increase in $\\nu_i$ leads to an increase in the tangential compliance contribution of body $i$. This, in turn, increases the total tangential compliance of the system. Since stiffness is the inverse of compliance, an increase in compliance results in a decrease in stiffness.\nThe analysis holds even when we properly account for the change in contact radius $a$. For a fixed normal load $P$, $a \\propto (1/E^*)^{1/3}$. As $\\nu$ increases, $(1-\\nu^2)$ decreases, so $1/E^*$ decreases, and thus $a$ decreases. The tangential stiffness $S_t$ is proportional to $a$ and inversely proportional to the material compliance term $f(\\nu_i)$. Both the numerator $a$ decreasing and the denominator term $f(\\nu_i)$ increasing will cause $S_t$ to decrease. Therefore, increasing $\\nu$ at fixed $E$ decreases the initial tangential stiffness.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n- **A) $E^* \\approx 58.6\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $G^* \\approx 11.8\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, and increasing $\\nu$ at fixed $E$ decreases the initial tangential stiffness.**\n  My calculation yielded $E^* \\approx 58.6\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$ and $G^* \\approx 11.8\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$.

According to Hertz's theory for the contact of two elastic spheres under a normal load $P$, the radius $a$ of the circular contact area is given by the relation:\n$$ a^3 = \\frac{3PR^*}{4E^*} $$\nThe problem is set at a constant normal load $P = P_0 = 1.00 \\times 10^2 \\ \\mathrm{N}$. Substituting the given values $R^* = 1.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m}$ and $E^* = 1.20 \\times 10^{11}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$:\n$$ a^3 = \\frac{3 \\times (1.00 \\times 10^2 \\ \\mathrm{N}) \\times (1.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m})}{4 \\times (1.20 \\times 10^{11}\\ \\mathrm{Pa})} = \\frac{3.00}{4.80 \\times 10^{11}}\\ \\mathrm{m}^3 = 6.25 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{m}^3 $$\n$$ a = (6.25 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{m}^3)^{1/3} \\approx 1.84236 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the contact radius is $a = 1.842 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n\nNext, we address Task 2: the calculation of the stick radius, $c$. The Cattaneo–Mindlin theory for a constant normal load $P$ and a monotonically increasing tangential load $Q$ establishes that the central region of the contact area, a circle of radius $c$, remains stuck, while the outer annulus ($c  r \\le a$) undergoes slip. The stick radius $c$ is related to the contact radius $a$, the coefficient of friction $f$, and the ratio of tangential to normal load by the following expression:\n$$ c = a \\left(1 - \\frac{Q}{fP}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nThe total tangential load at the end of Step 2 is $Q = Q_0 + \\Delta Q_1 + \\Delta Q_2 = 0 + 2.00 \\times 10^1 \\ \\mathrm{N} + 2.80 \\times 10^1 \\ \\mathrm{N} = 4.80 \\times 10^1 \\ \\mathrm{N}$. The maximum static friction force is $fP_0 = 0.60 \\times (1.00 \\times 10^2 \\ \\mathrm{N}) = 60.0 \\ \\mathrm{N}$.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$ \\frac{Q}{fP_0} = \\frac{48.0}{60.0} = 0.80 $$\n$$ c = (1.84236 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}) \\times (1 - 0.80)^{1/3} = (1.84236 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}) \\times (0.20)^{1/3} \\approx 1.0774 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the stick radius is $c = 1.077 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n\nFor Task 3, we derive the shear traction distribution, $q(r)$. The solution is obtained by superposing stress fields. In the slip annulus ($c  r \\le a$), the shear traction is at its limit, given by the local Coulomb friction law: $q(r) = f p(r)$, where $p(r)$ is the Hertzian normal pressure distribution:\n$$ p(r) = p_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^2} \\quad \\text{with} \\quad p_0 = \\frac{3P_0}{2\\pi a^2} $$\nIn the stick zone ($0 \\le r \\le c$), the traction is constructed by subtracting a corrective shear stress field from the limiting traction field. This results in the expression:\n$$ q(r) = f p_0 \\left[ \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^2} - \\frac{c}{a} \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{c}\\right)^2} \\right] $$\nWe first compute the peak normal pressure $p_0$:\n$$ p_0 = \\frac{3 \\times (1.00 \\times 10^2 \\ \\mathrm{N})}{2\\pi (1.84236 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m})^2} \\approx 1.4067 \\times 10^9 \\ \\mathrm{Pa} $$\nThe limiting shear traction amplitude is $fp_0 = 0.60 \\times (1.4067 \\times 10^9 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}) \\approx 8.4404 \\times 10^8 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$.\nThe ratio $c/a = (0.2)^{1/3} \\approx 0.5848$.\nThe piecewise shear traction distribution $q(r)$ is therefore:\nFor the slip annulus ($1.077 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}  r \\le 1.842 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}$):\n$$ q(r) = (8.440 \\times 10^8 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}) \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{1.842 \\times 10^{-4}}\\right)^2} $$\nFor the stick zone ($0 \\le r \\le 1.077 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}$):\n$$ q(r) = (8.440 \\times 10^8 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}) \\left[ \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{1.842 \\times 10^{-4}}\\right)^2} - 0.5848 \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{1.077 \\times 10^{-4}}\\right)^2} \\right] $$\n\nFinally, for Task 4, we compute the cumulative relative tangential displacement, $\\delta$. For monotonic loading, the relationship between the total tangential force $Q$ and displacement $\\delta$ is obtained by integrating the incremental tangential stiffness, $K_T = dQ/d\\delta$. The stiffness itself depends on the state of slip: $K_T = K_{T0} (c/a) = K_{T0} (1 - Q/fP_0)^{1/3}$, where $K_{T0} = 8 G^* a$ is the initial tangential stiffness for a fully stuck contact (as per Mindlin's result for a circular punch).\n$$ d\\delta = \\frac{dQ}{K_T} = \\frac{dQ}{8 G^* a (1 - Q/fP_0)^{1/3}} $$\nIntegrating from $Q=0$ (where $\\delta=0$) to the final tangential load $Q_f$ yields the total displacement:\n$$ \\delta = \\int_0^{Q_f} \\frac{dQ}{8 G^* a (1 - Q/fP_0)^{1/3}} = \\frac{3fP_0}{16G^*a} \\left[ 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{Q_f}{fP_0}\\right)^{2/3} \\right] $$\nWe use the final tangential load $Q_f = 48.0 \\ \\mathrm{N}$ and the previously calculated values. The pre-factor is:\n$$ \\frac{3fP_0}{16G^*a} = \\frac{3 \\times 0.60 \\times (1.00 \\times 10^2 \\ \\mathrm{N})}{16 \\times (3.00 \\times 10^{10} \\ \\mathrm{Pa}) \\times (1.84236 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m})} \\approx 2.0354 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nThe term in brackets is:\n$$ 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{48.0}{60.0}\\right)^{2/3} = 1 - (0.20)^{2/3} \\approx 1 - 0.3420 = 0.6580 $$\nThe total tangential displacement is:\n$$ \\delta \\approx (2.0354 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}) \\times 0.6580 \\approx 1.3393 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the displacement is $\\delta = 1.339 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\nThese results are compiled in the final answer.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.842 \\times 10^{-4}\n \n1.077 \\times 10^{-4}\n \n8.440 \\times 10^8 \\times \\begin{cases}\n\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{1.842 \\times 10^{-4}}\\right)^2} - 0.5848 \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{1.077 \\times 10^{-4}}\\right)^2}  \\text{for } 0 \\le r \\le 1.077 \\times 10^{-4} \\\\\n\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{1.842 \\times 10^{-4}}\\right)^2}  \\text{for } 1.077 \\times 10^{-4}  r \\le 1.842 \\times 10^{-4} \n\\end{cases}\n \n1.339 \\times 10^{-6}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2692987"}]}
