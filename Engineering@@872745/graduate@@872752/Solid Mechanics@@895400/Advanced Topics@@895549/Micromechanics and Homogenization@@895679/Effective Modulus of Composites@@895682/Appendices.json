It is a standard problem in the micromechanics of composite materials. We shall proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe Hashin-Shtrikman (HS) bounds for the effective elastic moduli of an isotropic composite are derived from the variational principles of elasticity. These principles state that the strain energy stored in a body under prescribed boundary conditions is an extremum. Specifically, the principle of minimum potential energy provides upper bounds on the effective stiffness moduli, while the principle of minimum complementary energy provides lower bounds. The HS bounds are the tightest possible bounds for an isotropic two-phase composite given only the volume fractions and phase properties, without further information on the microstructure.\n\nThe derivation employs a \"comparison\" or \"reference\" homogeneous material. The bounds are obtained by constructing specific admissible trial fields for displacement or stress, which are based on the exact solution for a single coated sphere subjected to uniform far-field loading.\n\nFirst, we define the properties of the two phases.\nPhase $1$ (matrix): volume fraction $v_1 = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$, bulk modulus $K_1 = 20$ GPa, shear modulus $G_1 = 8$ GPa.\nPhase $2$ (inclusion): volume fraction $v_2 = 0.25$, bulk modulus $K_2 = 120$ GPa, shear modulus $G_2 = 45$ GPa.\nWe observe that $K_2 > K_1$ and $G_2 > G_1$, so phase $2$ is the stiffer phase and phase $1$ is the softer phase.\n\nDerivation and Calculation of the Hashin-Shtrikman Upper Bound for Bulk Modulus, $K^{\\ast}_{HS+}$\n\nTo derive the upper bound for the effective bulk modulus, $K^{\\ast}$, one can apply the principle of minimum potential energy. The trial displacement field used in the HS methodology corresponds to that of a composite sphere assemblage where the stiffer phase ($2$) forms the matrix (shell) and the softer phase ($1$) forms the core. The relative volumes of core and shell are set to match the overall volume fractions $v_1$ and $v_2$. By solving the elasticity problem for such a composite sphere under hydrostatic loading and requiring self-consistency, one obtains an expression for the effective modulus. This expression is proven to be a rigorous upper bound.\n\nThe resulting formula for the HS upper bound on the bulk modulus is:\n$$\nK^{\\ast}_{HS+} = K_2 + \\frac{v_1}{\\frac{1}{K_1 - K_2} + \\frac{v_2}{K_2 + \\frac{4}{3}G_2}}\n$$\nThis bound is obtained when the stiffer phase ($K_2 > K_1$, $G_2 > G_1$) is chosen as the reference material.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into this expression.

The required statically admissible trial stress field is constructed based on a model where the softer phase ($1$) serves as the matrix for the stiffer phase ($2$). This configuration yields a rigorous lower bound for the effective shear modulus of a statistically isotropic composite. The derivation is significantly more complex than for the bulk modulus because a remote pure shear load induces a non-uniform and coupled stress state within the composite sphere.\n\nThe resulting formula for the HS lower bound on the shear modulus is:\n$$\nG^{\\ast}_{HS-} = G_1 + \\frac{v_2}{\\frac{1}{G_2 - G_1} + \\frac{6 v_1 (K_1 + 2G_1)}{5 G_1 (3K_1 + 4G_1)}}\n$$\nThis bound is obtained by selecting the softer phase ($1$) as the reference material.\n\nWe substitute the given numerical values:\n$$\nG^{\\ast}_{HS-} = 8 + \\frac{0.25}{\\frac{1}{45 - 8} + \\frac{6(0.75)(20 + 2(8))}{5(8)(3(20) + 4(8))}}\n$$\nWe evaluate the terms in the denominator separately.\nThe first term is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{45 - 8} = \\frac{1}{37}\n$$\nThe second term is:\n$$\n\\frac{6(0.75)(20 + 16)}{5(8)(60 + 32)} = \\frac{4.5(36)}{40(92)} = \\frac{162}{3680} = \\frac{81}{1840}\n$$\nNow, substitute these back:\n$$\nG^{\\ast}_{HS-} = 8 + \\frac{0.25}{\\frac{1}{37} + \\frac{81}{1840}}\n$$\nTo sum the fractions in the denominator:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{37} + \\frac{81}{1840} = \\frac{1840 + 81 \\times 37}{37 \\times 1840} = \\frac{1840 + 2997}{68080} = \\frac{4837}{68080}\n$$\nSo, the expression for $G^{\\ast}_{HS-}$ becomes:\n$$\nG^{\\ast}_{HS-} = 8 + \\frac{0.25}{\\frac{4837}{68080}} = 8 + \\frac{1/4}{\\frac{4837}{68080}} = 8 + \\frac{68080}{4 \\times 4837} = 8 + \\frac{17020}{4837}\n$$\n$$\nG^{\\ast}_{HS-} = 8 + 3.518916...\n$$\n$$\nG^{\\ast}_{HS-} = 11.518916... \\text{ GPa}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $G^{\\ast}_{HS-} = 11.52$ GPa.\n\nThe requested bounds are the Hashin-Shtrikman upper bound for the effective bulk modulus, $K^{\\ast}_{HS+}$, and the Hashin-Shtrikman lower bound for the effective shear modulus, $G^{\\ast}_{HS-}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n32.90 & 11.52\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2632775"}, {"introduction": "This practice bridges two cornerstone theories in micromechanics: the Hashin-Shtrikman bounds and Eshelby's solution for a single inclusion.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\nThe effective moduli of a composite with a dilute concentration $\\phi$ of inclusions can be determined by solving the problem of a single inclusion in an infinite matrix. The effective stiffness tensor $\\mathbb{C}_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is related to the matrix stiffness $\\mathbb{C}_{m}$ by:\n$$ \\mathbb{C}_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\mathbb{C}_{m} + \\phi \\langle (\\mathbb{C}_{inc} - \\mathbb{C}_{m}) \\mathbb{A} \\rangle_{\\text{inclusions}} $$\nwhere $\\mathbb{A}$ is the strain concentration tensor within the inclusions. For isotropic constituents and spherical inclusions, the effective bulk modulus $K_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and shear modulus $G_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ are determined. The effective Young's modulus is then $E_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 9K_{\\mathrm{eff}}G_{\\mathrm{eff}}/(3K_{\\mathrm{eff}}+G_{\\mathrm{eff}})$. We need to analyze how $K_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and $G_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ are affected by the interface/interphase model, to leading order in $\\phi$.\n\n**Model (a): Thin Interphase ($h \\ll a$)**\nIn this model, the inclusion is a composite sphere (core + shell). The effect of the thin interphase on the overall properties is related to its volume fraction and property contrast. The volume of the interphase around one inclusion is $V_s = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi((a+h)^3 - a^3) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^3 ( (1+h/a)^3 - 1 ) \\approx \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^3 (3h/a)$ for $h \\ll a$. The volume fraction of the interphase material in the entire composite is $\\phi_s = \\phi (V_s / V_i) \\approx 3\\phi(h/a)$, where $V_i = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^3$ is the core volume.\n\nThe deviation of the effective moduli from the perfectly bonded two-phase case (matrix + core) is caused by this interphase. This deviation will be proportional to the volume of the perturbing phase ($\\phi_s$) and the contrast in properties. Therefore, the leading-order change in any effective modulus, say $M_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ (where $M$ can be $K$, $G$, or $E$), will be of the form:\n$$ \\Delta M_{\\mathrm{eff}} = M_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(\\text{a})} - M_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(\\text{perfect})} \\sim \\mathcal{O}(\\phi_s) \\sim \\mathcal{O}(\\phi \\frac{h}{a}) $$\nThe prefactor for this expression depends on the contrast between all three phases (matrix, shell, core). Importantly, the dependence is on the dimensionless ratio $h/a$, not on the absolute particle size $a$.\n\n**Model (b): Imperfect Interface**\nIn this model, the interface condition introduces compliances $\\beta_n$ and $\\beta_t$. The units of $\\beta_n$ and $\\beta_t$ are length/stress (e.g., $\\text{m}/\\text{Pa}$). In the context of the single inclusion problem, these parameters must be combined with other problem parameters to form dimensionless groups that govern the solution. The relevant physical quantities are the matrix moduli (e.g., bulk modulus $K_m$ or shear modulus $G_m$) and the inclusion radius $a$. The dimensionless parameters governing the interface effect are:\n$$ \\alpha_n = \\frac{\\beta_n K_m}{a} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\alpha_t = \\frac{\\beta_t G_m}{a} $$\nThe solution to the single inclusion problem, and thus the effective moduli, will depend on these parameters. For small compliances, the deviation of the effective moduli from the perfectly bonded case ($\\beta_n, \\beta_t = 0$) will be linear in these parameters. The overall effect on the composite modulus is of order $\\phi$. Thus, the leading-order deviation is of the form:\n$$ \\Delta M_{\\mathrm{eff}} = M_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(\\text{b})} - M_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(\\text{perfect})} \\sim \\mathcal{O}\\left(\\phi \\left(\\frac{\\beta_n K_m}{a} + \\frac{\\beta_t G_m}{a}\\right)\\right) $$\nThis shows a clear dependence on the inverse of the particle size, $1/a$.\n\nWith these scaling laws established, we evaluate the options.\n\n**A. In the thin interphase case with $h \\ll a$, when $E_{s}<E_{m}$ the leading deviation of $E_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ from the perfectly bonded result is of order $\\phi\\,(h/a)$ times a contrast-dependent factor; in the spring-interface case with compliances $\\beta_{n},\\beta_{t}$, the leading deviation is of order $\\phi\\,\\left(\\beta_{n}K_{m}/a + \\beta_{t}G_{m}/a\\right)$, with $K_{m},G_{m}$ the matrix bulk and shear moduli. Thus, for fixed $\\beta_{n},\\beta_{t}$, smaller particles produce a larger softening.**\nThis statement accurately reflects our derivations.\n- The scaling for the thin interphase model is correctly identified as $\\mathcal{O}(\\phi(h/a))$.\n- The scaling for the imperfect interface model is correctly identified as being proportional to $\\phi/a$, with dimensionless groups involving $\\beta_n K_m/a$ and $\\beta_t G_m/a$.\n- The conclusion that for fixed interface properties ($\\beta_n, \\beta_t$), smaller radius $a$ leads to a larger effect (softening, since $\\beta_n, \\beta_t \\ge 0$) is a direct consequence of the $1/a$ dependence.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. For both models, at fixed $\\phi$ the leading change in $E_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is independent of particle size $a$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. As shown in the analysis for option A, the imperfect interface model (b) exhibits a strong dependence on particle size $a$ (specifically, $\\sim 1/a$). The thin interphase model (a) effect depends on the ratio $h/a$, so it is independent of $a$ only if this ratio is held constant. The statement claims independence for both models, which is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. A purely compliant imperfect interface with $\\beta_{n},\\beta_{t} \\ge 0$ cannot increase $E_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ beyond the perfectly bonded case, whereas a stiff interphase with $E_{s}>E_{m}$ can increase $E_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ at order $\\phi$.**\n- An imperfect interface with $\\beta_{n},\\beta_{t} > 0$ introduces additional compliance into the system. The displacement jumps $[\\![u]\\!]$ at the interface represent an additional source of strain for a given level of stress. From a strain energy perspective, for a fixed macroscopic strain $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^0$, the total strain energy stored is $W = \\frac{1}{2}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^0:\\mathbb{C}_{\\mathrm{eff}}:\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^0$. The interface jumps provide an additional mechanism to accommodate deformation, which lowers the required stress field and thus lowers the total strain energy compared to the perfectly bonded case (for the same average strain). A lower strain energy implies a lower stiffness. Therefore $E_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ cannot be increased. The case $\\beta_n=\\beta_t=0$ corresponds to perfect bonding.\n- A stiff interphase ($E_s > E_m$) acts as a reinforcement. A coated inclusion where the shell is stiffer than the matrix can have an effective stiffness greater than a bare inclusion perfectly bonded to the matrix. This increase in particle stiffness translates to an increase in the composite stiffness $E_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ at an order proportional to the volume fraction, $\\phi$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. For $E_{i}\\gg E_{m}$ and a very compliant interphase with $E_{s}\\ll E_{m}$ and fixed $h/a>0$, the composite can become softer than the pure matrix at order $\\phi$ because the compliant shell screens the stiff core.**\nThis statement describes the \"screening\" or \"shielding\" effect. The load from the matrix is transferred to the core inclusion through the interphase. If the interphase is very compliant ($E_s \\ll E_m$), it will undergo large strains, accommodating most of the deformation. This effectively shields the very stiff core ($E_i \\gg E_m$) from stress, so the core contributes very little to the overall stiffness of the composite particle. The coated particle as a whole behaves as a soft heterogeneity. If the effective stiffness of this coated particle is less than that of the matrix, the composite's effective modulus $E_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ will be lower than $E_m$. In the limit of $E_s \\to 0$, the interphase provides no resistance to deformation, and the coated inclusion behaves effectively as a void of radius $a+h$, which would certainly lead to $E_{\\mathrm{eff}} < E_m$. Thus, a soft interphase can indeed make the composite softer than the matrix, even if the core is rigid.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. The thin interphase and imperfect interface models are exactly equivalent for all $h/a$ under the identification $\\beta_{n}=h/K_{s}$ and $\\beta_{t}=h/G_{s}$, where $K_{s},G_{s}$ are the interphase bulk and shear moduli.**\nThis statement has several flaws.\n- **\"exactly equivalent\"**: The equivalence between a finite-thickness interphase and a zero-thickness interface is an asymptotic approximation, valid in the limit $h/a \\to 0$. It is not an exact identity for any finite $h/a$. The details of the stress and strain fields within the interphase cannot be fully captured by a simple jump condition.\n- **\"for all $h/a$\"**: This contradicts the premise that the equivalence is derived for thin interphases, i.e., in the limit $h/a \\to 0$.\n- **The identification formula**: The proposed correspondence, particularly $\\beta_n = h/K_s$, is a crude approximation. Rigorous asymptotic analysis for a spherical layer shows that the equivalent normal compliance depends on the uniaxial strain modulus or a combination of $K_s$ and $G_s$, not just the bulk modulus $K_s$. For example, a common result from more detailed derivations is $\\beta_n = h/(K_s + 4G_s/3)$ and $\\beta_t = h/G_s$. The formula $\\beta_n=h/K_s$ neglects the influence of shear rigidity on the response to normal stress due to the geometrical constraint of the spherical shell.\nTherefore, the statement is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2632785"}]}
