This is expressed by the condition $\\frac{\\partial \\Pi}{\\partial a} = 0$. We compute the partial derivative of $\\Pi$ with respect to $a$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Pi}{\\partial a} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\alpha\\,a^{2} + \\frac{1}{4}\\,\\beta\\,a^{4} - \\lambda\\,a \\right) = \\alpha\\,a + \\beta\\,a^{3} - \\lambda\n$$\nSetting this derivative to zero yields the equilibrium relation between the load $\\lambda$ and the amplitude $a$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\alpha\\,a + \\beta\\,a^{3}\n$$\nThis equation describes the set of all equilibrium points, known as the equilibrium path, in the $(\\lambda, a)$ space.\n\n**Task 2: Condition for a Limit Point**\nA limit point, or turning point, on the equilibrium path occurs where the load parameter $\\lambda$ reaches a local extremum with respect to the generalized amplitude $a$. At such a point, the tangent to the equilibrium path in the $(a, \\lambda)$ plane is horizontal, meaning $\\frac{d\\lambda}{da} = 0$. Using the equilibrium relation derived in Task 1:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\lambda}{da} = \\frac{d}{da} (\\alpha\\,a + \\beta\\,a^{3}) = \\alpha + 3\\,\\beta\\,a^{2}\n$$\nSetting this derivative to zero gives the amplitude, which we denote $a_{lim}$, at the limit point:\n$$\n\\alpha + 3\\,\\beta\\,a_{lim}^{2} = 0\n$$\nSolving for $a_{lim}^{2}$:\n$$\na_{lim}^{2} = -\\frac{\\alpha}{3\\beta}\n$$\nFor a real-valued solution for $a_{lim}$ to exist, $a_{lim}^{2}$ must be positive. Since the problem statement specifies that $a$ is real and that $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are non-zero, we must have:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\alpha}{3\\beta} > 0\n$$\nThis inequality is equivalent to $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} < 0$, which implies that $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ must have opposite signs. This is the algebraic condition for the existence of a limit point.\n\n**Task 3: Magnitude of the Limit Load**\nThe limit load, $\\lambda_{lim}$, is the value of the load parameter $\\lambda$ at the amplitude $a_{lim}$. From Task 2, the amplitude at the limit point satisfies $a_{lim} = \\pm\\sqrt{-\\frac{\\alpha}{3\\beta}}$. We substitute this into the equilibrium equation $\\lambda = \\alpha\\,a + \\beta\\,a^{3}$. It is efficient to factor the expression first:\n$$\n\\lambda_{lim} = a_{lim}(\\alpha + \\beta\\,a_{lim}^{2})\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $a_{lim}^{2}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{lim} = a_{lim}\\left(\\alpha + \\beta\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{3\\beta}\\right)\\right) = a_{lim}\\left(\\alpha - \\frac{\\alpha}{3}\\right) = \\frac{2\\alpha}{3} a_{lim}\n$$\nNow, substituting the expression for $a_{lim}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{lim} = \\pm \\frac{2\\alpha}{3} \\sqrt{-\\frac{\\alpha}{3\\beta}}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of the extremal load, which is $|\\lambda_{lim}|$. It is most convenient to find this by first squaring $\\lambda_{lim}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{lim}^{2} = \\left(\\frac{2\\alpha}{3} a_{lim}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{4\\alpha^{2}}{9} a_{lim}^{2} = \\frac{4\\alpha^{2}}{9} \\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{3\\beta}\\right) = -\\frac{4\\alpha^{3}}{27\\beta}\n$$\nThe magnitude is the positive square root of this expression. The expression is guaranteed to be positive because the condition for the existence of the limit point is $\\alpha\\beta < 0$, which ensures that $-\\frac{\\alpha^{3}}{\\beta} = -\\alpha^{2}\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} > 0$.\n$$\n|\\lambda_{lim}| = \\sqrt{-\\frac{4\\alpha^{3}}{27\\beta}} = 2\\sqrt{-\\frac{\\alpha^{3}}{27\\beta}}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the magnitude of the limit load.\n\n**Task 4: Stability of Equilibrium Branches**\nThe stability of an equilibrium configuration is determined by the sign of the second variation of the total potential energy. For a single degree of freedom system, this is the second derivative $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial a^2}$. An equilibrium point is stable if $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial a^2} > 0$ and unstable if $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial a^2} < 0$. The condition $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial a^2} = 0$ signifies a critical point of neutral stability.\nLet's compute the second derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial a^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a} \\left(\\alpha\\,a + \\beta\\,a^{3} - \\lambda\\right) = \\alpha + 3\\,\\beta\\,a^{2}\n$$\nWe observe that this is the same expression as for $\\frac{d\\lambda}{da}$. Thus, the stability condition is directly related to the slope of the equilibrium path in the $(a, \\lambda)$ plane:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial a^2} = \\frac{d\\lambda}{da}\n$$\nAt the limit point, $\\frac{d\\lambda}{da} = 0$, which means $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial a^2} = 0$, confirming that it is a point of neutral stability. On either side of a limit point, the value of $a$ is different, and thus the sign of $\\frac{d\\lambda}{da}$ is different. Specifically, $\\frac{d\\lambda}{da}$ changes sign as $a$ passes through $a_{lim}$.\nTherefore, one branch of the equilibrium path approaching the limit point is stable ($\\frac{d\\lambda}{da} > 0$), while the other branch departing from it is unstable ($\\frac{d\\lambda}{da} < 0$). The limit point itself marks the boundary between stable and unstable regions on the continuous equilibrium path. This loss of stability at a maximum or minimum load is characteristic of a limit point instability, often called snap-through buckling in structural mechanics.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2\\sqrt{-\\frac{\\alpha^{3}}{27\\beta}}}\n$$", "id": "2673018"}, {"introduction": "Moving from abstract models to tangible engineering structures, this exercise demonstrates how to analyze the initial post-buckling response of a flat plate using energy methods.

In reality, as the load increases further into the post-buckling regime, the shape of the deflection $w(x,y)$ changes. Higher-order harmonics of the fundamental mode become non-negligible, typically causing a flattening of the central portion of the plate. This change in shape alters the distribution of membrane and bending strains, meaning the load-deflection path $N_x(A)$ deviates from the simple parabolic form $N_{\\text{cr}} + K A^{2}$. The coefficient $K$ is therefore only a good predictor for deflections that are very small, typically less than the plate thickness $t$.\n2.  **Inadequacy of Simplified Membrane Field**: The problem assumes specific membrane strain expressions ($\\varepsilon_x = \\frac{1}{2} w_x^2$, etc.) which imply zero in-plane displacements $u$ and $v$ throughout the plate. A more rigorous application of von Kármán theory would satisfy the in-plane equilibrium and compatibility equations, typically through the introduction of an Airy stress function. This would reveal a complex, non-uniform membrane stress field that is not simply proportional to local derivatives of $w$. The single-mode approximation for $w$ cannot simultaneously satisfy these additional constraints. This is particularly relevant for clamped boundaries, where strong in-plane restraining stresses develop near the edges to enforce the boundary conditions, a phenomenon not well captured by the assumed simple deflection mode and simplified strain field. The predicted stiffness $K$ is thus an approximation sensitive to the choice of the mode shape and the simplifications made in the membrane energy calculation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{52}{3}}\n$$", "id": "2672999"}, {"introduction": "While approximate methods are powerful, few nonlinear stability problems possess an exact analytical solution.

We use the standard derivatives of elliptic integrals: $\\frac{dK}{dk} = \\frac{E(k)-(1-k^2)K(k)}{k(1-k^2)}$ and $\\frac{dE}{dk} = \\frac{E(k)-K(k)}{k}$.\nThe derivative of the normalized load is:\n$$\\frac{d\\hat{P}}{dk} = \\frac{8K(k)}{\\pi^2} \\frac{E(k)-(1-k^2)K(k)}{k(1-k^2)}$$\nThe derivative of the normalized end-shortening is:\n$$\\frac{d\\hat{\\delta}}{dk} = -2 \\frac{K\\frac{dE}{dk} - E\\frac{dK}{dk}}{K^2} = \\frac{2}{k(1-k^2)K(k)^2} \\left( E(k)^2 - 2(1-k^2)K(k)E(k) + (1-k^2)K(k)^2 \\right)$$\nDividing the two derivatives gives the stiffness:\n$$S(k) = \\frac{d\\hat{P}/dk}{d\\hat{\\delta}/dk} = \\frac{\\frac{8K(k)}{\\pi^2} \\frac{E-(1-k^2)K}{k(1-k^2)}}{\\frac{2}{k(1-k^2)K^2} (E^2 - 2(1-k^2)KE + (1-k^2)K^2)}$$\n$$S(k) = \\frac{4K(k)^3}{\\pi^2} \\frac{E(k)-(1-k^2)K(k)}{E(k)^2 - 2(1-k^2)K(k)E(k) + (1-k^2)K(k)^2}$$\nFor stability under end-shortening (displacement) control, the tangent stiffness $S(k) = \\frac{d\\hat{P}}{d\\hat{\\delta}}$ must be positive, meaning an increase in displacement requires an increase in load. We analyze the signs of $\\frac{d\\hat{P}}{dk}$ and $\\frac{d\\hat{\\delta}}{dk}$.\nFor $k \\in (0, 1)$, it is a known property of elliptic integrals that $K(k)>0$, $E(k)-(1-k^2)K(k)>0$, and the function $E(k)/K(k)$ is monotonically decreasing.\n- The sign of $\\frac{d\\hat{P}}{dk}$ is determined by $E(k)-(1-k^2)K(k)$, which is positive. Thus, $\\frac{d\\hat{P}}{dk} > 0$. The load increases with the deformation parameter $k$.\n- The sign of $\\frac{d\\hat{\\delta}}{dk}$ is determined by $- \\frac{d}{dk}(E/K)$. Since $E/K$ is a decreasing function, its derivative is negative, making $\\frac{d\\hat{\\delta}}{dk}$ positive. The end-shortening also increases with $k$.\n\nSince both $\\frac{d\\hat{P}}{dk}$ and $\\frac{d\\hat{\\delta}}{dk}$ are positive for all $k \\in (0, 1)$, their ratio $S(k)$ is also positive.
