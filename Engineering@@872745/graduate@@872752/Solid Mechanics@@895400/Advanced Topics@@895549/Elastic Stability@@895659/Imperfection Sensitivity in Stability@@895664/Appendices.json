For a critical mode with amplitude $x$ and a set of $m-1$ non-critical modes with amplitudes $y_j$ ($j=2, \\dots, m$), these equations are given in a canonical form.\n\nThe equilibrium equation for the critical mode amplitude $x$ is:\n$$\n(k - k_c)\\,x + c\\,x^2 + d\\,x^3 + \\sum_{j=2}^{m} r_j\\,x\\,y_j = \\epsilon\\,h\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the load parameter, $k_c$ is its critical value at bifurcation, $\\epsilon$ is the imperfection amplitude, and $c, d, r_j, h$ are constant coefficients derived from the energy expansion.\n\nThe equilibrium equations for the stable, non-critical mode amplitudes $y_j$ are:\n$$\ns_j\\,y_j + p_j\\,x^2 = \\epsilon\\,g_j\n$$\nwhere $s_j  0$ represents the stable stiffness for mode $j$, and $p_j, g_j$ are interaction coefficients.\n\nFrom the second set of equations, each non-critical amplitude $y_j$ can be expressed as a function of the critical amplitude $x$ and the imperfection amplitude $\\epsilon$:\n$$\ny_j(x,\\epsilon) = -\\frac{p_j}{s_j}\\,x^2 + \\frac{g_j}{s_j}\\,\\epsilon\n$$\nSubstituting this result into the equilibrium equation for the critical mode allows for the elimination of all $y_j$, yielding a single equation relating $k$, $x$, and $\\epsilon$:\n$$\n(k - k_c)\\,x + c\\,x^2 + d\\,x^3 + \\sum_{j=2}^{m} r_j\\,x\\,\\left(-\\frac{p_j}{s_j}\\,x^2 + \\frac{g_j}{s_j}\\,\\epsilon\\right) = \\epsilon\\,h\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$\n(k - k_c)\\,x + c\\,x^2 + \\left(d - \\sum_{j=2}^{m}\\frac{r_j p_j}{s_j}\\right)x^3 = \\epsilon\\,h + \\epsilon\\,x\\,\\sum_{j=2}^{m}\\frac{r_j g_j}{s_j}\n$$\nSolving for the load parameter $k$ gives the load-amplitude relationship for the multi-mode model, $k_{\\mathrm{multi}}(x, \\epsilon)$:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{multi}}(x,\\epsilon) = k_c - c\\,x - \\left(d - \\sum_{j=2}^{m} \\frac{r_j\\,p_j}{s_j}\\right)x^2 - \\left(\\sum_{j=2}^{m} \\frac{r_j\\,g_j}{s_j}\\right)\\epsilon + \\frac{\\epsilon\\,h}{x}\n$$\nThis expression is simplified by defining two effective coefficients:\n$$\nd_{\\mathrm{eff}} = d - \\sum_{j=2}^{m} \\frac{r_j\\,p_j}{s_j} \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad \\gamma = \\sum_{j=2}^{m} \\frac{r_j\\,g_j}{s_j}\n$$\nThus, the multi-mode load-amplitude curve is given by:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{multi}}(x,\\epsilon) = k_c - c\\,x - d_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\,x^2 - \\gamma\\,\\epsilon + \\frac{\\epsilon\\,h}{x}\n$$\nThe single-mode model is a simplification where all non-critical modes are ignored, equivalent to setting all coupling coefficients $r_j$ to $0$. In this case, $d_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ reduces to $d$ and $\\gamma$ becomes $0$. The single-mode load-amplitude relation is therefore:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{single}}(x,\\epsilon) = k_c - c\\,x - d\\,x^2 + \\frac{\\epsilon\\,h}{x}\n$$\nFor a structure exhibiting imperfection sensitivity, the critical load is the minimum load a structure can sustain post-buckling. For a given imperfection level $\\epsilon$, this corresponds to the minimum value of the load-amplitude curve $k(x, \\epsilon)$ for positive amplitudes $x  0$. This minimum, denoted $k^{\\min}(\\epsilon)$, is found by solving the stationarity condition $\\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial x} = 0$.\n\nApplying this condition to the generic form $k(x,\\epsilon) = k_c - c\\,x - d_\\star\\,x^2 - \\gamma_\\star\\,\\epsilon + \\frac{\\epsilon\\,h}{x}$ (where $d_\\star=d, \\gamma_\\star=0$ for the single-mode case and $d_\\star=d_{\\mathrm{eff}}, \\gamma_\\star=\\gamma$ for the multi-mode case), we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial x} = -c - 2\\,d_\\star\\,x - \\frac{\\epsilon\\,h}{x^2} = 0\n$$\nMultiplying by $-x^2$ and rearranging gives a cubic equation for the minimizing amplitude $x^*(\\epsilon)$:\n$$\n2\\,d_\\star\\,x^3 + c\\,x^2 - \\epsilon\\,h = 0\n$$\nThe problem statement asserts that for the provided test cases, $d_\\star  0$ and $c \\ge 0$. With $\\epsilon  0$ and $h$ typically positive for imperfections shaped like the critical mode, the term $-\\epsilon\\,h$ is negative. This guarantees the existence of a unique positive real root $x^*(\\epsilon)$, which can be found numerically.\n\nFor each model (single and multi), the procedure is as follows:\n1. For a given $\\epsilon$, solve the corresponding cubic equation for the unique positive real root, $x_{\\mathrm{single}}^*(\\epsilon)$ or $x_{\\mathrm{multi}}^*(\\epsilon)$.\n2. Substitute this root back into the respective load-amplitude relation, $k_{\\mathrm{single}}(x, \\epsilon)$ or $k_{\\mathrm{multi}}(x, \\epsilon)$, to find the minimum load, $k_{\\mathrm{single}}^{\\min}(\\epsilon)$ or $k_{\\mathrm{multi}}^{\\min}(\\epsilon)$.\n\nThe discrepancy between the two models for a given $\\epsilon$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\Delta k(\\epsilon) = \\left| k_{\\mathrm{single}}^{\\min}(\\epsilon) - k_{\\mathrm{multi}}^{\\min}(\\epsilon) \\right|\n$$\nThe single-mode model is deemed sufficient if the maximum discrepancy over the specified set of imperfection amplitudes $\\{\\epsilon\\}$ does not exceed a given tolerance $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\max_{\\epsilon} \\Delta k(\\epsilon) \\le \\tau\n$$\nThe algorithm implemented in the final answer follows these steps for each test case. It computes $d_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and $\\gamma$, then iterates through the provided values of $\\epsilon$. In each iteration, it solves the two cubic equations for $x_{\\mathrm{single}}^*$ and $x_{\\mathrm{multi}}^*$, calculates the corresponding minimum loads, computes the discrepancy $\\Delta k(\\epsilon)$, and tracks the maximum discrepancy found. Finally, this maximum is compared against the tolerance $\\tau$ to yield a boolean verdict. For Case 1 where no additional modes are specified, the sums defining $d_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and $\\gamma$ are empty and thus equal to $0$, leading to $d_{\\mathrm{eff}}=d$ and $\\gamma=0$, which makes the two models identical and the discrepancy $\\Delta k(\\epsilon)$ exactly $0$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem for all test cases and prints the results.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Test cases defined as tuples:\n    # (kc, c, d, h, {s_j}, {p_j}, {r_j}, {g_j}, {epsilon}, tau)\n    test_cases = [\n        # Test case 1 (no mode coupling; baseline happy path)\n        (1.0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, [], [], [], [], [1.0e-4, 5.0e-4, 1.0e-3, 2.0e-3], 1.0e-4),\n        \n        # Test case 2 (mild mode coupling; difference expected to be small)\n        (1.0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, [10.0, 20.0], [0.1, -0.05], [0.3, 0.2], [0.05, -0.02], [1.0e-4, 5.0e-4, 1.0e-3, 2.0e-3], 1.5e-5),\n        \n        # Test case 3 (strong mode coupling; single-mode expected to be insufficient)\n        (1.0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, [2.0, 3.0], [0.6, 0.5], [1.0, 0.8], [0.2, -0.1], [1.0e-4, 5.0e-4, 1.0e-3, 2.0e-3], 5.0e-5),\n        \n        # Test case 4 (edge case with c=0; symmetric pre-buckling nonlinearity)\n        (1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, [15.0], [0.05], [0.2], [0.0], [1.0e-4, 5.0e-4, 1.0e-3, 2.0e-3], 5.0e-5),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        verdict = is_single_mode_sufficient(case)\n        results.append(verdict)\n\n    # The problem asks for Python-style boolean values (True/False with capitalization)\n    py_style_results = [str(r) for r in results]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(py_style_results)}]\")\n\ndef get_positive_real_root(coeffs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the unique positive real root of a polynomial given its coefficients.\n    The problem guarantees a unique positive real root for the specific cubic equations.\n    \"\"\"\n    roots = np.roots(coeffs)\n    real_roots = roots[np.isreal(roots)].real\n    positive_real_roots = real_roots[real_roots > 0]\n    return positive_real_roots[0]\n\ndef calculate_min_load(kc, c, d_star, gamma_star, epsilon, h):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum load k_min for a given model and imperfection epsilon.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Cubic equation for minimizing amplitude x^*: 2*d_star*x^3 + c*x^2 - epsilon*h = 0\n    cubic_coeffs = [2 * d_star, c, 0, -epsilon * h]\n    x_star = get_positive_real_root(cubic_coeffs)\n    \n    # Load-amplitude relation: k(x,eps) = kc - c*x - d_star*x^2 - gamma_star*eps + (eps*h)/x\n    k_min = kc - c * x_star - d_star * x_star**2 - gamma_star * epsilon + (epsilon * h) / x_star\n    return k_min\n\ndef is_single_mode_sufficient(case_params):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs the sufficiency assessment for a single test case.\n    \"\"\"\n    kc, c, d, h, s_list, p_list, r_list, g_list, epsilons, tau = case_params\n\n    # Single-mode model parameters\n    d_single = d\n\n    # Calculate multi-mode model effective parameters\n    sum_r_p_over_s = sum((r * p) / s for s, p, r in zip(s_list, p_list, r_list))\n    sum_r_g_over_s = sum((r * g) / s for s, g, r in zip(s_list, g_list, r_list))\n    \n    d_eff = d - sum_r_p_over_s\n    gamma = sum_r_g_over_s\n\n    # The problem guarantees d_star > 0\n    if not (d_single > 0 and d_eff > 0):\n        # This check is for robustness, though problem statement guarantees it\n        raise ValueError(\"Effective stiffness d_star must be positive.\")\n\n    max_discrepancy = 0.0\n\n    for epsilon in epsilons:\n        # Calculate minimum load for single-mode model\n        k_single_min = calculate_min_load(kc, c, d_single, 0, epsilon, h)\n        \n        # Calculate minimum load for multi-mode model\n        k_multi_min = calculate_min_load(kc, c, d_eff, gamma, epsilon, h)\n        \n        # Calculate discrepancy and update maximum\n        discrepancy = abs(k_single_min - k_multi_min)\n        if discrepancy > max_discrepancy:\n            max_discrepancy = discrepancy\n    \n    return max_discrepancy = tau\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2648331"}]}
