A wrinkling instability occurs when a periodic out-of-plane displacement can lower the total potential energy of the system. This is possible only if the membrane energy contribution is negative, which requires the presence of a compressive stress.\n\nWe begin by analyzing the given in-plane stress resultant state. The stress resultant tensor $\\boldsymbol{N}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{N} = \\begin{pmatrix} N_{xx} & N_{xy} \\\\ N_{yx} & N_{yy} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & S \\\\ S & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo understand the nature of this stress state, we find its principal stresses (eigenvalues) and principal directions (eigenvectors). The characteristic equation is $\\det(\\boldsymbol{N} - \\lambda \\boldsymbol{I}) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} -\\lambda & S \\\\ S & -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (-\\lambda)(-\\lambda) - (S)(S) = \\lambda^2 - S^2 = 0\n$$\nThe principal stress resultants are $\\lambda_{1} = S$ and $\\lambda_{2} = -S$. Since $S>0$, $\\lambda_1$ is a tensile stress and $\\lambda_2$ is a compressive stress.\n\nThe principal directions are found from the eigenvectors.\nFor the tensile stress $\\lambda_{1} = S$:\n$$\n(\\boldsymbol{N} - S \\boldsymbol{I})\\boldsymbol{v} = 0 \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} -S & S \\\\ S & -S \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies -S v_x + S v_y = 0 \\implies v_x = v_y\n$$\nThe eigenvector is proportional to $(1, 1)$, which corresponds to a direction at an angle of $\\theta = \\arctan(1/1) = \\pi/4$ radians, or $45^\\circ$, with respect to the $x$-axis.\n\nFor the compressive stress $\\lambda_{2} = -S$:\n$$\n(\\boldsymbol{N} + S \\boldsymbol{I})\\boldsymbol{v} = 0 \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} S & S \\\\ S & S \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies S v_x + S v_y = 0 \\implies v_x = -v_y\n$$\nThe eigenvector is proportional to $(1, -1)$, which corresponds to a direction at an angle of $\\theta = \\arctan(-1/1) = -\\pi/4$ radians, or $-45^\\circ$, with respect to the $x$-axis.\n\nThus, the state of pure shear is equivalent to a tensile stress of magnitude $S$ acting along the $+45^\\circ$ direction and a compressive stress of magnitude $S$ acting along the $-45^\\circ$ direction.\n\nThe variational formulation for the potential energy $\\mathcal{E}$ of a pre-stressed plate involves a positive-definite bending energy term, $\\mathcal{U}_B \\propto \\int B (\\nabla^2 w)^2 dA$, and a membrane energy term, $\\mathcal{U}_M \\propto \\int (N_{ij} w_{,i} w_{,j}) dA$. Wrinkling instability is driven by the compressive component of the pre-stress, which can lead to a negative membrane energy contribution ($\\mathcal{U}_M < 0$) that overcomes the stabilizing bending energy. The system seeks to form wrinkles in a direction that maximally relieves the compressive stress. For a wrinkle pattern characterized by a wavevector $\\boldsymbol{k}$, the energy is minimized when $\\boldsymbol{k}$ is aligned with the direction of principal compression. In this case, the direction of principal compression is $-45^\\circ$. Therefore, the most energetically favorable wrinkle pattern will have its wavevector $\\boldsymbol{k}$ oriented at an angle of $-45^\\circ$. The reference to \"$\\pm 45^\\circ$\" in the problem description is understood to identify the two principal axes generic to a pure shear state, with the compressive one being responsible for the instability.\n\nPart 2: Linear Stability Analysis\n\nThe governing equation of motion for the out-of-plane displacement $w(x,y,t)$ of a thin plate with pre-stress, inertia, and damping is:\n$$\n\\rho h \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial t^2} + c \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial t} + B \\nabla^4 w = N_{xx} \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2} + N_{yy} \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial y^2} + 2 N_{xy} \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y}\n$$\nSubstituting the given stress resultants ($N_{xx}=0$, $N_{yy}=0$, $N_{xy}=S$):\n$$\n\\rho h \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial t^2} + c \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial t} + B \\nabla^4 w = 2S \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y}\n$$\nWe seek a solution in the form of a normal mode:\n$$\nw(x,y,t) = \\Re\\{A \\exp(\\sigma t + i\\,\\boldsymbol{k}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{x})\\}\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{k} = (k_x, k_y) = (k\\cos\\theta, k\\sin\\theta)$ is the wavevector and $\\sigma$ is the complex growth rate.

If the discriminant $c^2 - 4\\rho h (B k^4 + S k^2 \\sin(2\\theta))$ is negative, the roots are complex conjugates with real part $\\Re(\\sigma) = -c/(2\\rho h) \\le 0$, which signifies damped oscillations. Thus, for an instability to occur, the discriminant must be non-negative, and the growth rate must be positive. We take the '$+$' sign for the largest possible growth rate:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{-c + \\sqrt{c^2 - 4\\rho h (B k^4 + S k^2 \\sin(2\\theta))}}{2 \\rho h}\n$$\nTo maximize the growth rate $\\sigma$ for a given wavenumber $k$, we must maximize the argument of the square root. This is equivalent to minimizing the term $B k^4 + S k^2 \\sin(2\\theta)$ with respect to the angle $\\theta$. The term $B k^4$ is independent of $\\theta$, and since $S > 0$ and $k^2 > 0$, we must minimize the function $\\sin(2\\theta)$.\n\nThe minimum value of $\\sin(2\\theta)$ is $-1$. This occurs when:\n$$\n2\\theta = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2n\\pi, \\quad \\text{for } n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\nSolving for $\\theta$ gives the angle $\\theta^\\star$ that maximizes the growth rate:\n$$\n\\theta^\\star = -\\frac{\\pi}{4} + n\\pi\n$$\nThe principal value for the angle, corresponding to $n=0$, is $\\theta^\\star = -\\pi/4$ radians. This confirms the qualitative reasoning that the wrinkling instability is most pronounced for wavevectors aligned with the direction of principal compression.\n\nThe problem asks for the absolute value of this angle.\n$$\n|\\theta^\\star| = \\left|-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right| = \\frac{\\pi}{4}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$$", "id": "2711439"}, {"introduction": "While stability analysis predicts the onset of wrinkling, the post-buckling behavior involves finite-amplitude deformations with their own geometric constraints.
