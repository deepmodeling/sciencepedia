An arbitrary initial guess $\\xi_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ must first be handled. If $\\xi_0$ lies outside the safe interval $[\\epsilon, 1-\\epsilon]$ (for a small $\\epsilon  0$, e.g., $10^{-9}$), it must be projected to a robust starting point within this interval, such as $\\xi_0 = 0.9$.

Calculate the function value $f_n = f(\\xi_n; \\kappa)$ and its derivative $f'_n = f'(\\xi_n; \\kappa)$.\n    b.

Update the bracket $[a, b]$: if $f_n  0$, set $a = \\max(a, \\xi_n)$; if $f_n  0$, set $b = \\min(b, \\xi_n)$.\n    d.  Compute the raw Newton step $\\Delta\\xi_n = -f_n / f'_n$.\n\n3.  **Globalization and Fallback**: The raw Newton step may be too large or unreliable.\n    a.  **Fallback to Bisection**: A bisection step is taken if the Newton step is unreliable. This occurs if $|f'_n|$ is close to zero (e.g., $|f'_n|  10^{-6}$) or if backtracking fails. The bisection step is $\\Delta\\xi_n = (a+b)/2 - \\xi_n$.\n    b.  **Damped Backtracking**: A line search is performed to find a suitable step length $\\alpha_n \\in (0, 1]$. We start with $\\alpha_n=1$ and successively reduce it (e.g., $\\alpha_n \\leftarrow \\alpha_n/2$) until the candidate iterate $\\xi_{n+1} = \\xi_n + \\alpha_n \\Delta\\xi_n$ satisfies two conditions: (i) domain admissibility, $\\xi_{n+1} \\in (0, 1)$, and (ii) sufficient decrease, $|f(\\xi_{n+1}; \\kappa)|  |f(\\xi_n; \\kappa)|$.\n    c.  If the backtracking loop fails to find a suitable $\\alpha_n$, we fallback to a single bisection step.\n\n4.  **Update and Termination**:\n    a.  The iterate is updated: $\\xi_{n+1} = \\xi_n + \\alpha_n \\Delta\\xi_n$.\n    b.  Check for step size convergence: if $|\\xi_{n+1} - \\xi_n|  \\tau_{step}(1+|\\xi_n|)$, the algorithm terminates.\n    c.  A maximum number of iterations provides a safeguard against non-convergence.\n\n5.  **Convergence Properties**:\n    Newton's method exhibits **quadratic convergence** if (i) the function $f$ is twice continuously differentiable ($C^2$) near the root, (ii) the root $\\xi^\\star$ is simple ($f'(\\xi^\\star) \\neq 0$), and (iii) the initial guess $\\xi_0$ is sufficiently close to $\\xi^\\star$. The Rayleigh function is smooth in the search interval, and the nontrivial root is known to be simple.\n    \n    Convergence may degrade to **linear** if the iterate is far from the root, necessitating damping ($\\alpha_n  1$). The designed globalization strategy ensures robust, albeit slower, progress towards the basin of quadratic convergence. The fallback to bisection, a linearly convergent method, is a crucial safety measure for cases where Newton's method behaves poorly.\n\nThe implementation of this algorithm for Task C is provided in the final answer section.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f_rayleigh(xi, kappa):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the Rayleigh secular function f(xi; kappa).\n    The domain requires xi  1 and xi  kappa.
