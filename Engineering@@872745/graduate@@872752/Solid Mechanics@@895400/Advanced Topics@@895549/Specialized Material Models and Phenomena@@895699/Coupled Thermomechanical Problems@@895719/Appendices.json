The global residual is assembled from element-level contributions.\n\n**Element-level contributions**: For an element $e$ with nodes $(1, 2)$, the residuals and matrices are:\n-   **Mechanical Residual** $\\mathbf{R}_u^e$:\n    $$ \\mathbf{R}_u^e = \\mathbf{K}_{uu}^e \\mathbf{u}^{n+1, e} + \\mathbf{K}_{uT}^e \\mathbf{T}^{n+1, e} + \\mathbf{f}_{u,th}^e $$\n    where $\\mathbf{K}_{uu}^e = \\frac{AE}{h}\\begin{bmatrix}1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1\\end{bmatrix}$ is the stiffness matrix, $\\mathbf{K}_{uT}^e = -\\frac{AE\\alpha}{2}\\begin{bmatrix}-1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1\\end{bmatrix}$ is the mechanical-thermal coupling matrix, and $\\mathbf{f}_{u,th}^e = AE\\alpha T_0\\begin{bmatrix}-1\\\\1\\end{bmatrix}$ is a constant thermal force vector.\n-   **Thermal Residual** $\\mathbf{R}_T^e$:\n    $$ \\mathbf{R}_T^e = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\Delta t}\\mathbf{C}_{TT}^e + \\mathbf{K}_{TT}^e\\right)\\mathbf{T}^{n+1, e} + \\frac{1}{\\Delta t}\\mathbf{K}_{Tu}^e \\mathbf{u}^{n+1, e} - \\frac{1}{\\Delta t}\\left(\\mathbf{C}_{TT}^e\\mathbf{T}^{n, e} + \\mathbf{K}_{Tu}^e\\mathbf{u}^{n, e}\\right) $$\n    where $\\mathbf{C}_{TT}^e = \\frac{A\\rho c h}{6}\\begin{bmatrix}2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2\\end{bmatrix}$ is the heat capacity matrix, $\\mathbf{K}_{TT}^e = \\frac{Ak}{h}\\begin{bmatrix}1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1\\end{bmatrix}$ is the thermal conductivity matrix, and $\\mathbf{K}_{Tu}^e = \\frac{AT_0E\\alpha}{2}\\begin{bmatrix}-1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 1\\end{bmatrix}$ is the thermal-mechanical coupling matrix.\n\nThe **Jacobian matrix**, $\\mathbf{J} = \\partial \\mathbf{R}/\\partial \\mathbf{y}^{n+1}$, is essential for Newton's method. It is a $2 \\times 2$ block matrix assembled from element Jacobians:\n$$ \\mathbf{J} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{J}_{uu} & \\mathbf{J}_{uT} \\\\ \\mathbf{J}_{Tu} & \\mathbf{J}_{TT} \\end{bmatrix} $$\nThe global block matrices are assembled from these element-level matrices:\n-   $\\mathbf{J}_{uu}^e = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{R}_u^e}{\\partial \\mathbf{u}^{n+1, e}} = \\mathbf{K}_{uu}^e$\n-   $\\mathbf{J}_{uT}^e = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{R}_u^e}{\\partial \\mathbf{T}^{n+1, e}} = \\mathbf{K}_{uT}^e$\n-   $\\mathbf{J}_{Tu}^e = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{R}_T^e}{\\partial \\mathbf{u}^{n+1, e}} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t}\\mathbf{K}_{Tu}^e$\n-   $\\mathbf{J}_{TT}^e = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{R}_T^e}{\\partial \\mathbf{T}^{n+1, e}} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t}\\mathbf{C}_{TT}^e + \\mathbf{K}_{TT}^e$\n\nNote the physical interpretation of the coupling matrices: $\\mathbf{K}_{uT}$ represents the generation of mechanical stress/force due to a temperature field, while $\\mathbf{K}_{Tu}$ represents the generation of heat due to the rate of mechanical deformation (strain rate). The Jacobian is generally non-symmetric ($\\mathbf{J}_{uT} \\neq \\mathbf{J}_{Tu}^T$) for this standard formulation.\n\nThe implementation will perform these steps: assemble the global residual $\\mathbf{R}$ and Jacobian $\\mathbf{J}$ from element contributions for each test case, apply Dirichlet boundary conditions by partitioning the system into free and fixed degrees of freedom, and compute the required norms on the resulting reduced system.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main solver function to run test cases for the coupled thermoelastic problem.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # Test Case A (happy path)\n        {\n            'L': 1.0, 'A': 1.0, 'N_nodes': 3, 'E': 210e9, 'alpha': 1.2e-5,\n            'rho': 7800.0, 'c': 500.0, 'k': 45.0, 'T0': 293.0, 'dt': 0.25,\n            'TL': 300.0, 'TR': 280.0, 'case_id': 'A'\n        },\n        # Test Case B (decoupling edge case)\n        {\n            'L': 1.0, 'A': 1.0, 'N_nodes': 3, 'E': 210e9, 'alpha': 0.0,\n            'rho': 7800.0, 'c': 500.0, 'k': 45.0, 'T0': 293.0, 'dt': 0.25,\n            'TL': 300.0, 'TR': 280.0, 'case_id': 'B'\n        },\n        # Test Case C (conduction-limited and parameter variation)\n        {\n            'L': 1.0, 'A': 0.01, 'N_nodes': 4, 'E': 70e9, 'alpha': 2.0e-5,\n            'rho': 2700.0, 'c': 900.0, 'k': 1e-6, 'T0': 300.0, 'dt': 10.0,\n            'TL': 400.0, 'TR': 350.0, 'case_id': 'C'\n        },\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for params in test_cases:\n        case_results = run_case(**params)\n        results.extend(case_results)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\ndef run_case(L, A, N_nodes, E, alpha, rho, c, k, T0, dt, TL, TR, case_id):\n    \"\"\"\n    Assembles and evaluates the residual and Jacobian for a single test case.\n    \"\"\"\n    N_el = N_nodes -
