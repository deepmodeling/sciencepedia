It then iterates through each case (A, B, C), defines a function to compute the complete residual vector for that case, and calls the `least_squares` optimizer to find the best-fit parameters. The initial guess for the optimization is the prior parameter vector $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0$. Finally, the results from all cases are collected and printed in the specified format.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import least_squares\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the poroelastic inverse problem for three test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = {\n        \"A\": {\n            \"drained\": {\n                \"load\": np.array([10.0, 30.0, 50.0]),\n                \"meas\": np.array([0.005002, 0.014999, 0.025001]),\n                \"std\": 2e-6\n            },\n            \"undrained\": {\n                \"load\": np.array([10.0, 30.0, 50.0]),\n                \"meas_p\": np.array([7.02754386, 21.03263158, 35.1027193]),\n                \"std_p\": 5e-2,\n                \"meas_eps\": np.array([0.002190982456, 0.006579947368, 0.01096691228]),\n                \"std_eps\": 2e-6\n            },\n            \"unjacketed\": {\n                \"load\": np.array([5.0, 15.0, 25.0]),\n                \"meas\": np.array([0.000501, 0.001498, 0.002501]),\n                \"std\": 2e-6\n            }\n        },\n        \"B\": {\n            \"drained\": {\n                \"load\": np.array([8.0, 24.0, 40.0]),\n                \"meas\": np.array([0.008001, 0.023998, 0.040003]),\n                \"std\": 2e-6\n            },\n            \"undrained\": {\n                \"load\": np.array([8.0, 24.0, 40.0]),\n                \"meas_p\": np.array([7.38007244, 22.20121732, 36.9403622]),\n                \"std_p\": 5e-2,\n                \"meas_eps\": np.array([0.000755476, 0.002262429, 0.003775381]),\n                \"std_eps\": 2e-6\n            },\n            \"unjacketed\": {\n                \"load\": np.array([6.0, 18.0, 30.0]),\n                \"meas\": np.array([0.000119, 0.000361, 0.000599]),\n                \"std\": 2e-6\n            }\n        },\n        \"C\": {\n            \"drained\": {\n                \"load\": np.array([12.0, 36.0, 60.0]),\n                \"meas\": np.array([0.002402, 0.007198, 0.012002]),\n                \"std\": 2e-6\n            },\n            \"undrained\": {\n                \"load\": np.array([12.0, 36.0, 60.0]),\n                \"meas_p\": np.array([2.753091604, 8.234274812, 13.747459]),\n                \"std_p\": 5e-2,\n                \"meas_eps\": np.array([0.002289076336, 0.006871229009, 0.01144838165]),\n                \"std_eps\": 2e-6\n            },\n            \"unjacketed\": {\n                \"load\": np.array([7.0, 21.0, 35.0]),\n                \"meas\": np.array([0.001121, 0.003359, 0.005602]),\n                \"std\": 2e-6\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Parameter priors, regularization, and bounds\n    theta_0 = np.array([2500.0, 0.85, 7000.0])\n    lambda_reg = 1e-6\n    L = np.diag([1/2500.0, 1/0.5, 1/7000.0])\n    sqrt_lambda_L = np.sqrt(lambda_reg) * L\n    bounds = ([100.0, 0.01, 100.0], [50000.0, 0.99, 100000.0])\n    \n    all_results = []\n\n    for case_name in [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"]:\n        case_data = test_cases[case_name]\n\n        def residual_function(theta):\n            Kb, alpha, M = theta\n            \n            # --- Data Residuals ---\n            # Drained\n            d_data = case_data[\"drained\"]\n            eps_d_model = d_data[\"load\"] / Kb\n            res_d = (eps_d_model - d_data[\"meas\"]) / d_data[\"std\"]\n\n            # Undrained\n            u_data = case_data[\"undrained\"]\n            Ku = Kb + alpha**2 * M\n            p_u_model = (alpha * M / Ku) * u_data[\"load\"]\n            eps_u_model = u_data[\"load\"] / Ku\n            res_p_u = (p_u_model - u_data[\"meas_p\"]) / u_data[\"std_p\"]\n            res_eps_u = (eps_u_model - u_data[\"meas_eps\"]) / u_data[\"std_eps\"]\n\n            # Unjacketed\n            uj_data = case_data[\"unjacketed\"]\n            eps_uj_model = (1.0 - alpha) * uj_data[\"load\"] / Kb\n            res_uj = (eps_uj_model - uj_data[\"meas\"]) / uj_data[\"std\"]\n\n            # --- Regularization Residuals ---\n            res_reg = sqrt_lambda_L @ (theta - theta_0)\n            \n            return np.concatenate([res_d, res_p_u, res_eps_u, res_uj, res_reg])\n\n        # Solve the nonlinear least-squares problem\n        result = least_squares(\n            fun=residual_function,\n            x0=theta_0,\n            bounds=bounds,\n            method='trf'\n        )\n\n        estimated_params = [round(p, 6) for p in result.x]\n        all_results.append(estimated_params)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(all_results)\n\n# This function is not executed here, but represents the code that generates the answer.\n# solve()\n```", "answer": "[[1999.998958, 0.700001, 5000.003463], [1000.000373, 0.980000, 9500.002826], [5000.000788, 0.200000, 2999.998124]]", "id": "2695874"}]}
