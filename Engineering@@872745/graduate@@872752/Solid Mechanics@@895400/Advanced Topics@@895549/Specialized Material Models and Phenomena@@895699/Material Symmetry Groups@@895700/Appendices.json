It is a standard problem in continuum mechanics that is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the cubic elasticity tensor $\\mathbb{C}$\nWe begin with the most general elasticity tensor $\\mathbb{C}$ possessing only the inherent minor and major symmetries, which has $21$ independent components. We then impose the constraints required by cubic symmetry. The cubic symmetry group includes, among others, rotations by $\\pi$ about the coordinate axes ($x_1, x_2, x_3$) and a rotation by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ about a coordinate axis.\n\nFirst, consider a rotation by $\\pi$ about the $x_3$-axis. The transformation matrix is $\\mathbf{Q} = \\text{diag}(-1, -1, 1)$. The invariance condition $C_{ijkl} = Q_{ip}Q_{jq}Q_{kr}Q_{ls}C_{pqrs}$ must hold. A component $C_{ijkl}$ remains unchanged only if the product $Q_{ii}Q_{jj}Q_{kk}Q_{ll}$ (summation implied, but here indices are fixed) is $+1$. Any component with an odd number of indices equal to $1$ or $2$ will change sign. For instance, $C'_{1113} = Q_{11}Q_{11}Q_{11}Q_{33}C_{1113} = (-1)(-1)(-1)(1)C_{1113} = -C_{1113}$. For invariance, we must have $C_{1113}=0$. Applying this logic for $\\pi$ rotations about all three axes demonstrates that the only non-zero components are of the form $C_{iiii}$, $C_{iijj}$ (with $i \\ne j$), and $C_{ijij}$ (with $i \\ne j$). This is the form for an orthotropic material, which has $9$ independent constants. In Voigt matrix notation, this corresponds to:\n$$\n\\mathbf{C}_{\\text{ortho}} = \\begin{pmatrix} C_{11} & C_{12} & C_{13} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ C_{12} & C_{22} & C_{23} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ C_{13} & C_{23} & C_{33} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & C_{44} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & C_{55} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & C_{66} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nHere, the Voigt notation mapping is $11 \\to 1$, $22 \\to 2$, $33 \\to 3$, $23 \\to 4$, $13 \\to 5$, $12 \\to 6$. The components are $C_{11}=C_{1111}$, $C_{12}=C_{1122}$, $C_{44}=C_{2323}$, etc.\n\nNext, we impose a higher symmetry of the cubic group, such as a rotation by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ about the $x_3$-axis. The transformation matrix is $\\mathbf{Q}$ such that $x_1' = x_2, x_2' = -x_1, x_3' = x_3$. Its components are $Q_{12}=1$, $Q_{21}=-1$, $Q_{33}=1$, and all others are zero.\nApplying the invariance condition $C_{pqrs} = Q_{pi} Q_{qj} Q_{rk} Q_{sl}\\, C_{ijkl}$:\n- For $C_{1111}$: $C_{1111}' = Q_{1i}Q_{1j}Q_{1k}Q_{1l}C_{ijkl} = Q_{12}Q_{12}Q_{12}Q_{12}C_{2222} = C_{2222}$. Invariance requires $C_{1111} = C_{2222}$.\n- By considering a $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ rotation about the $x_1$-axis, we can similarly show $C_{2222} = C_{3333}$. Thus, $C_{1111} = C_{2222} = C_{3333}$. In Voigt notation, this implies $C_{11}=C_{22}=C_{33}$.\n\n- For $C_{1133}$: $C_{1133}' = Q_{1i}Q_{1j}Q_{3k}Q_{3l}C_{ijkl} = Q_{12}Q_{12}Q_{33}Q_{33}C_{2233} = C_{2233}$. Invariance requires $C_{1133} = C_{2233}$.\n- By symmetry of axis permutations, we must also have $C_{1122} = C_{1133} = C_{2233}$. Due to the major symmetry $C_{iijj}=C_{jji i}$, all off-diagonal normal components are equal. In Voigt notation, this means $C_{12}=C_{13}=C_{23}$.\n\n- For $C_{2323}$: $C_{2323}' = Q_{2i}Q_{3j}Q_{2k}Q_{3l}C_{ijkl} = Q_{21}Q_{33}Q_{21}Q_{33}C_{1313} = (-1)(1)(-1)(1)C_{1313} = C_{1313}$. Invariance requires $C_{2323} = C_{1313}$.\n- By axis permutations, we must also have $C_{1212} = C_{2323} = C_{1313}$. In Voigt notation, this means $C_{44}=C_{55}=C_{66}$.\n\nThe orthotropic matrix thus reduces to the form for a cubic material with $3$ independent constants, $C_{11}$, $C_{12}$, and $C_{44}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} C_{11} & C_{12} & C_{12} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ C_{12} & C_{11} & C_{12} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ C_{12} & C_{12} & C_{11} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & C_{44} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & C_{44} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & C_{44} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis is the most general form consistent with cubic symmetry.\n\nPart 2: Compliance matrix $\\mathbb{S}$ and engineering constants\nThe compliance matrix $\\mathbf{S}$ is the inverse of the stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{C}$. Since $\\mathbf{C}$ is block-diagonal, we can invert the blocks separately.\nThe shear part is trivial: the inverse of the diagonal matrix $\\text{diag}(C_{44}, C_{44}, C_{44})$ is $\\text{diag}(1/C_{44}, 1/C_{44}, 1/C_{44})$. This gives $S_{44}=S_{55}=S_{66}=1/C_{44}$.\nFor the normal stress-strain part, we must invert the $3 \\times 3$ matrix:\n$$ \\mathbf{C}_{\\text{norm}} = \\begin{pmatrix} C_{11} & C_{12} & C_{12} \\\\ C_{12} & C_{11} & C_{12} \\\\ C_{12} & C_{12} & C_{11} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant is $\\det(\\mathbf{C}_{\\text{norm}}) = (C_{11}-C_{12})^2(C_{11}+2C_{12})$.\nThe inverse matrix $\\mathbf{S}_{\\text{norm}} = \\mathbf{C}_{\\text{norm}}^{-1}$ is found via the adjugate method. The components of $\\mathbf{S}_{\\text{norm}}$ are:\n$$ S_{11} = \\frac{C_{11}^2 - C_{12}^2}{\\det(\\mathbf{C}_{\\text{norm}})} = \\frac{(C_{11}-C_{12})(C_{11}+C_{12})}{(C_{11}-C_{12})^2(C_{11}+2C_{12})} = \\frac{C_{11}+C_{12}}{(C_{11}-C_{12})(C_{11}+2C_{12})} $$\n$$ S_{12} = \\frac{C_{12}^2 - C_{11}C_{12}}{\\det(\\mathbf{C}_{\\text{norm}})} = \\frac{-C_{12}(C_{11}-C_{12})}{(C_{11}-C_{12})^2(C_{11}+2C_{12})} = \\frac{-C_{12}}{(C_{11}-C_{12})(C_{11}+2C_{12})} $$\nThe full compliance matrix $\\mathbf{S}$ has the same structure as $\\mathbf{C}$, with components $S_{11}$, $S_{12}$, and $S_{44}$.\n\nNow we relate these components to the engineering constants for loading along a cube axis. Consider uniaxial tension along the $x_1$-axis, so $\\sigma_1 \\ne 0$ and all other $\\sigma_i=0$. From $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\mathbf{S}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$:\n- Axial strain: $\\varepsilon_1 = S_{11}\\sigma_1$\n- Transverse strain: $\\varepsilon_2 = S_{12}\\sigma_1$ and $\\varepsilon_3 = S_{12}\\sigma_1$\nYoung's modulus is $E = \\sigma_1/\\varepsilon_1 = 1/S_{11}$.\n$$ E = \\frac{1}{S_{11}} = \\frac{(C_{11}-C_{12})(C_{11}+2C_{12})}{C_{11}+C_{12}} $$\nPoisson's ratio is $\\nu = -\\varepsilon_2/\\varepsilon_1 = -S_{12}/S_{11}$.\n$$ \\nu = -\\frac{S_{12}}{S_{11}} = -\\frac{-C_{12}/((C_{11}-C_{12})(C_{11}+2C_{12}))}{(C_{11}+C_{12})/((C_{11}-C_{12})(C_{11}+2C_{12}))} = \\frac{C_{12}}{C_{11}+C_{12}} $$\nFor pure shear on a coordinate plane, e.g., the $1-2$ plane, we have $\\sigma_6 = \\sigma_{12} \\ne 0$ and other stresses are zero. The engineering shear strain is $\\gamma_{12} = \\varepsilon_6 = S_{66}\\sigma_6$. The shear modulus $G$ is defined as $G = \\sigma_6/\\varepsilon_6 = 1/S_{66}$. Since for a cubic material $S_{66}=S_{44}=1/C_{44}$, we have:\n$$ G = C_{44} $$\nThis result is consistent with the tensorial relation $\\sigma_{12} = 2C_{1212}\\varepsilon_{12}$ and the engineering definition $G = \\sigma_{12}/\\gamma_{12} = \\sigma_{12}/(2\\varepsilon_{12})$, which gives $G=C_{1212}$. For cubic materials, symmetry requires that $C_{1212}=C_{44}$.\n\nPart 3: Constraints and distinctions\nFor a general orthotropic material, the compliance matrix is described by $9$ independent engineering constants: $E_1, E_2, E_3, \\nu_{12}, \\nu_{23}, \\nu_{31}, G_{12}, G_{23}, G_{31}$. The compliance matrix is:\n$$ \\mathbf{S}_{\\text{ortho}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/E_1 & -\\nu_{12}/E_1 & -\\nu_{13}/E_1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -\\nu_{21}/E_2 & 1/E_2 & -\\nu_{23}/E_2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -\\nu_{31}/E_3 & -\\nu_{32}/E_3 & 1/E_3 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1/G_{23} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1/G_{13} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1/G_{12} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nwhere symmetry requires $\\nu_{ij}/E_i = \\nu_{ji}/E_j$.\nComparing this to the cubic compliance matrix reveals the following constraints for cubic symmetry:\n1.  Diagonal normal components are equal: $S_{11}=S_{22}=S_{33} \\Rightarrow 1/E_1 = 1/E_2 = 1/E_3$, so $E_1=E_2=E_3$.\n2.  Off-diagonal normal components are equal: $S_{12}=S_{13}=S_{23} \\Rightarrow \\nu_{12}/E_1 = \\nu_{13}/E_1 = \\nu_{23}/E_2$. With $E_1=E_2$, this implies $\\nu_{12} = \\nu_{13} = \\nu_{23}$.\n3.  Shear components are equal: $S_{44}=S_{55}=S_{66} \\Rightarrow 1/G_{23} = 1/G_{13} = 1/G_{12}$, so $G_{12}=G_{23}=G_{13}$.\n\nThese constraints reduce the $9$ independent constants of an orthotropic material to $3$ for a cubic material. An orthotropic material, like wood, does not satisfy these equalities.\n\nTo distinguish cubic from isotropic elasticity, we note that an isotropic material has only $2$ independent elastic constants (e.g., $E$ and $\\nu$), with the shear modulus given by the relation $G = E / (2(1+\\nu))$. A cubic material is isotropic if and only if its constants satisfy this additional constraint. Substituting our derived expressions for $E$, $\\nu$, and $G$:\n$$ C_{44} = \\frac{\\frac{(C_{11}-C_{12})(C_{11}+2C_{12})}{C_{11}+C_{12}}}{2\\left(1 + \\frac{C_{12}}{C_{11}+C_{12}}\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{(C_{11}-C_{12})(C_{11}+2C_{12})}{C_{11}+C_{12}}}{2\\left(\\frac{C_{11}+C_{12}+C_{12}}{C_{11}+C_{12}}\\right)} = \\frac{(C_{11}-C_{12})(C_{11}+2C_{12})}{2(C_{11}+2C_{12})} $$\n$$ C_{44} = \\frac{C_{11}-C_{12}}{2} $$\nThis is known as the isotropy condition for a cubic material. Anisotropy is often quantified by the Zener ratio, $A = 2C_{44}/(C_{11}-C_{12})$, which must equal $1$ for isotropy. Thus, a cubic material is more general than an isotropic one, becoming isotropic only when the material constants satisfy the specific algebraic relation $2C_{44} = C_{11}-C_{12}$.\nThe final answer required is the ordered triple $(E, \\nu, G)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{(C_{11}-C_{12})(C_{11}+2C_{12})}{C_{11}+C_{12}} & \\frac{C_{12}}{C_{11}+C_{12}} & C_{44} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2658748"}, {"introduction": "Beyond applying a known symmetry, a crucial task is to determine the symmetry group of a material from its given constitutive response.

For each generator $\\mathbf{Q}^{(m)}$ and for each basis strain $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{(k)}$, compute $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{(k)}=\\mathbb{C}:\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{(k)}$ and check whether $\\mathbf{Q}^{(m)}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{(k)}\\mathbf{Q}^{(m)\\mathsf{T}}=\\mathbb{C}:\\left(\\mathbf{Q}^{(m)}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{(k)}\\mathbf{Q}^{(m)\\mathsf{T}}\\right)$. All must hold to accept the group.\n- For continuous candidates like rotations about $\\mathbf{e}_3$, one can impose the same condition symbolically for a generic rotation $\\mathbf{Q}(\\theta)$ about $\\mathbf{e}_3$ with angle $\\theta$ and verify identically in $\\theta$ (via trigonometric polynomial identities) that the equality holds for all $\\theta$ if and only if the transverse isotropy constraints among $C_{ij}$ are satisfied. Equivalently, verify $(\\mathbf{Q}(\\theta)\\star\\mathbb{C})=\\mathbb{C}$ componentwise and show all $\\theta$-dependent terms vanish.\n\nWith those principles established, evaluate the options.\n\nOption A: The enumeration includes $\\mathrm{O}(3)$, transverse isotropy about $\\mathbf{e}_3$, and orthotropy aligned with $\\{\\mathbf{e}_1,\\mathbf{e}_2,\\mathbf{e}_3\\}$, followed by monoclinic and triclinic. This hierarchy is scientifically justified given the observed structure: the presented $\\mathbb{C}$ has at least transverse isotropy about $\\mathbf{e}_3$, with isotropy as a special parameter subcase; orthotropy is a weaker symmetry contained in transverse isotropy, and monoclinic/triclinic are even weaker. The proposed test uses the defining invariance condition $\\mathbf{Q}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\mathbf{Q}^{\\mathsf{T}}=\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{Q}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\mathbf{Q}^{\\mathsf{T}})$, checks it on a basis $\\{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{(k)}\\}$ (which is sufficient by linearity), and treats discrete versus continuous groups appropriately, either via generators or a one-parameter family. This is rigorous and correct. Verdict — Correct.\n\nOption B: The enumeration omits transverse isotropy and orthotropy, which are the most relevant candidates for the given structure, and considers only isotropy and cubic symmetry. The test protocol conflates frame indifference (objectivity) with material symmetry and uses a single nonzero strain and a single rotation, which cannot establish invariance for all $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$. Moreover, passing a single $\\pi/2$ rotation is insufficient to conclude cubic symmetry. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption C: The enumeration lists transverse isotropy and hexagonal $\\mathrm{D}_{6h}$. In linear elasticity, hexagonal symmetry is equivalent to transverse isotropy for the stiffness tensor; however, the explicit exclusion of isotropy is unjustified because certain parameter equalities do yield isotropy. The testing method compares only principal stresses for three axial strain states, which is insufficient: material symmetry requires invariance for all symmetric $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, not just axial states, and shear couplings are ignored. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption D: The enumeration includes only orthotropy and monoclinic symmetry, omitting the stronger and more appropriate candidates (transverse isotropy and isotropy). The test restricts attention to reflections and ignores shear components when comparing, which is not a logically sufficient check of the invariance condition. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption E: Although the enumeration includes plausible groups, the proposed test condition $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})=\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{Q}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\mathbf{Q}^{\\mathsf{T}})$ omits the necessary transformation of stress, which is part of the definition of material symmetry. Using only one shear and one normal strain is also insufficient to establish invariance for all $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only option that both enumerates appropriate candidate symmetry groups and prescribes a rigorous invariance-checking protocol grounded in first principles is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2658745"}, {"introduction": "This advanced practice reveals the deep connection between a material's symmetry and its physical response modes. By finding the eigenvalues and eigen-tensors of the stiffness operator, you will gain a coordinate-invariant understanding of how a transversely isotropic material uniquely responds to different types of deformation. This exercise uses projection operators and spectral decomposition to analyze the fundamental structure of the stiffness tensor, moving beyond a simple component-based description [@problem_id:2658718].", "problem": "A homogeneous linear elastic solid possesses transverse isotropy about a fixed unit vector $\\boldsymbol{n}$ (symmetry axis), meaning its material symmetry group is the set of all proper and improper rotations that leave $\\boldsymbol{n}$ invariant. Let $\\mathbb{C}$ denote the fourth-order stiffness operator acting on the space of symmetric second-order tensors, with the conventional strain-stress relation $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbb{C} : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$.\n\nStarting from the definitions of material symmetry and linear elasticity, and using only the invariance of $\\mathbb{C}$ under the transverse isotropy group about $\\boldsymbol{n}$, do the following:\n\n1. Introduce the second-order projectors $\\boldsymbol{P} = \\boldsymbol{n} \\otimes \\boldsymbol{n}$ and $\\boldsymbol{Q} = \\boldsymbol{I} - \\boldsymbol{P}$, and use them to decompose the space of symmetric second-order tensors into invariant subspaces under the action of the symmetry group. Explain why these subspaces correspond to: (i) axial normal strains, (ii) in-plane isotropic normal strains, (iii) in-plane deviatoric strains (including in-plane shear), and (iv) axial shear strains.\n\n2. Using only the invariance constraints and the linearity of $\\mathbb{C}$, specialize to a Cartesian basis aligned with $\\boldsymbol{n}$ as the third basis vector so that the stiffness operator is represented by five independent moduli. Denote these by $C_{11}$, $C_{33}$, $C_{12}$, $C_{13}$, and $C_{44}$ in the usual principal-axis form, with the in-plane shear modulus given by $C_{66} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(C_{11} - C_{12}\\right)$.\n\n3.

Your final output should be the four eigenvalues of $\\mathbb{C}$, in terms of $C_{11}$, $C_{33}$, $C_{12}$, $C_{13}$, and $C_{44}$ (with $C_{66} = \\frac{1}{2}(C_{11}-C_{12})$), ordered as $\\lambda_{+}$, $\\lambda_{-}$, $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{T}}$, $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{A}}$, where $\\lambda_{\\pm}$ are the two normal-mode eigenvalues, $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{T}}$ is the transverse (in-plane deviatoric) shear eigenvalue, and $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{A}}$ is the axial shear eigenvalue.\n\nAnswer specification:\n- Provide a single closed-form analytic expression for the four eigenvalues as a row matrix $\\left(\\lambda_{+},\\ \\lambda_{-},\\ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{T}},\\ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{A}}\\right)$.\n- Do not evaluate numerically and do not append units to the expressions; express only in terms of the stiffness components as symbols.\n- No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem as stated is well-posed and grounded in the established principles of continuum mechanics. It is internally consistent and provides all necessary information for a rigorous derivation. We shall proceed with the analysis by following the prescribed steps.\n\nThe subject of this problem is a homogeneous linear elastic solid whose material response is characterized by the fourth-order stiffness operator $\\mathbb{C}$. The material possesses transverse isotropy about a fixed unit vector $\\boldsymbol{n}$. This means that the material's properties are invariant under any rotation (proper or improper) belonging to the group $G = \\{\\boldsymbol{R} \\in \\mathrm{O}(3) | \\boldsymbol{R}\\boldsymbol{n} = \\boldsymbol{n}\\}$. The invariance of the stiffness operator is expressed as:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{R} (\\mathbb{C} : (\\boldsymbol{R}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\boldsymbol{R})) \\boldsymbol{R}^{\\mathsf{T}} = \\mathbb{C} : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\quad \\forall \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\in \\mathrm{Sym}(3), \\forall \\boldsymbol{R} \\in G $$\nThis is equivalent to the condition that $\\mathbb{C}$ must commute with the action of the symmetry group, which in tensorial form is written as $C_{ijkl} = R_{ia} R_{jb} R_{kc} R_{ld} C_{abcd}$ for all $\\boldsymbol{R} \\in G$.\n\nPart 1: Decomposition of the Space of Symmetric Tensors\n\nWe introduce the orthogonal projection operators $\\boldsymbol{P} = \\boldsymbol{n} \\otimes \\boldsymbol{n}$ and $\\boldsymbol{Q} = \\boldsymbol{I} - \\boldsymbol{P}$, where $\\boldsymbol{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor. These projectors are orthogonal, $\\boldsymbol{P}:\\boldsymbol{Q} = 0$, and complete, $\\boldsymbol{P}+\\boldsymbol{Q}=\\boldsymbol{I}$. The space of symmetric second-order tensors, $\\mathrm{Sym}(3)$, can be decomposed into subspaces that are invariant under the action of the symmetry group $G$. Any symmetric tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ can be uniquely decomposed as follows:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\boldsymbol{P}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\boldsymbol{P} + (\\boldsymbol{P}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\boldsymbol{Q} + \\boldsymbol{Q}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\boldsymbol{P}) + \\boldsymbol{Q}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\boldsymbol{Q} $$\nThis decomposition separates the tensor into its axial, shear, and planar components. We refine this further.\n\n1.  **Axial Normal Component**: The term $\\boldsymbol{P}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\boldsymbol{P} = (\\boldsymbol{n} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\boldsymbol{n}) (\\boldsymbol{n} \\otimes \\boldsymbol{n}) = \\varepsilon_{nn} \\boldsymbol{P}$ represents the normal strain component along the symmetry axis $\\boldsymbol{n}$. This forms a one-dimensional invariant subspace spanned by $\\boldsymbol{P}$, corresponding to **(i) axial normal strains**.\n\n2.  **Planar Component**: The term $\\boldsymbol{Q}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\boldsymbol{Q}$ is a symmetric tensor with its range and domain in the plane perpendicular to $\\boldsymbol{n}$. It can be decomposed into an isotropic (trace) part and a deviatoric (traceless) part within that plane.\n    *   The planar trace is $\\mathrm{tr}_{\\perp}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) = \\boldsymbol{Q}:\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$. The isotropic part is represented by $\\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{Q}:\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\boldsymbol{Q}$, since $\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{Q})=2$. This forms a one-dimensional invariant subspace spanned by $\\boldsymbol{Q}$, corresponding to **(ii) in-plane isotropic normal strains**.\n    *   The deviatoric part is $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{dev}} = \\boldsymbol{Q}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\boldsymbol{Q} - \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{Q}:\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\boldsymbol{Q}$. This is a two-dimensional subspace of traceless symmetric tensors in the transverse plane, corresponding to **(iii) in-plane deviatoric strains**, which includes in-plane shear.\n\n3.  **Axial Shear Component**: The term $\\boldsymbol{P}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\boldsymbol{Q} + \\boldsymbol{Q}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\boldsymbol{P}$ represents the shear interaction between the axial direction and the transverse plane. This forms a two-dimensional invariant subspace corresponding to **(iv) axial shear strains**.\n\nBy Schur's lemma, since these four subspaces are invariant under the symmetry group, the operator $\\mathbb{C}$ cannot map vectors from one subspace to another, and its action within the two-dimensional subspaces (axial shear and in-plane deviatoric strains) is isotropic, i.e., a scalar multiple of the identity on that subspace. The action on the two one-dimensional normal strain subspaces couples them, forming a $2 \\times 2$ block.\n\nPart 2: Stiffness Moduli and Part 3: Spectral Decomposition\n\nWe perform the analysis in a Cartesian basis $\\{\\boldsymbol{e}_1, \\boldsymbol{e}_2, \\boldsymbol{e}_3\\}$ where the axis of symmetry is $\\boldsymbol{n} = \\boldsymbol{e}_3$. The stiffness operator components are the given five independent moduli $C_{11}, C_{33}, C_{12}, C_{13}, C_{44}$. We find the eigenvalues of $\\mathbb{C}$ by examining its action on each invariant subspace. Eigenvalues of a fourth-order tensor are scalars $\\lambda$ such that there exists a non-zero symmetric second-order tensor $\\boldsymbol{E}$ (an eigen-tensor) for which $\\mathbb{C}:\\boldsymbol{E} = \\lambda\\boldsymbol{E}$.\n\n**Shear Mode Eigenvalues**\n\n*   **Axial Shear Eigenvalue ($\\lambda_{\\mathrm{A}}$)**: We consider an eigen-tensor from the axial shear subspace, for instance $\\boldsymbol{E}_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\boldsymbol{e}_1 \\otimes \\boldsymbol{e}_3 + \\boldsymbol{e}_3 \\otimes \\boldsymbol{e}_1)$. The only non-zero components are $E_{13} = E_{31} = 1/\\sqrt{2}$. The stress tensor is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbb{C}:\\boldsymbol{E}_{\\mathrm{A}}$. The relevant component is $\\sigma_{13} = C_{13kl}E_{kl} = C_{1313}E_{13} + C_{1331}E_{31}$. In standard Voigt notation, $C_{44} = C_{1313} = C_{2323}$. Using minor symmetries, $\\sigma_{13} = 2C_{44}E_{13}$. Thus, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = 2C_{44}\\boldsymbol{E}_{\\mathrm{A}}$. The entire two-dimensional axial shear subspace consists of eigen-tensors with the eigenvalue:\n    $$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{A}} = 2C_{44} $$\n\n*   **Transverse Shear Eigenvalue ($\\lambda_{\\mathrm{T}}$)**: We consider an eigen-tensor from the in-plane deviatoric subspace, for example, the simple shear mode $\\boldsymbol{E}_{\\mathrm{T}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\boldsymbol{e}_1 \\otimes \\boldsymbol{e}_2 + \\boldsymbol{e}_2 \\otimes \\boldsymbol{e}_1)$. The only non-zero components are $E_{12} = E_{21} = 1/\\sqrt{2}$. The stress component is $\\sigma_{12} = C_{12kl}E_{kl} = 2C_{1212}E_{12}$. In Voigt notation, $C_{66}=C_{1212}$. The problem provides the relation $C_{66} = \\frac{1}{2}(C_{11}-C_{12})$. Therefore, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = 2C_{66}\\boldsymbol{E}_{\\mathrm{T}} = (C_{11}-C_{12})\\boldsymbol{E}_{\\mathrm{T}}$. The two-dimensional in-plane deviatoric subspace consists of eigen-tensors with eigenvalue:\n    $$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{T}} = C_{11}-C_{12} $$\n\n**Normal Mode Eigenvalues ($\\lambda_{\\pm}$)**\n\nThe remaining two eigenvalues correspond to the normal strain subspace spanned by $\\boldsymbol{P}$ and $\\boldsymbol{Q}$. We determine the action of $\\mathbb{C}$ on these basis tensors.\n*   Action on $\\boldsymbol{P} = \\boldsymbol{e}_3 \\otimes \\boldsymbol{e}_3$: The strain is $\\varepsilon_{33}=1$, others zero. The stress components are $\\sigma_{11} = C_{1133} = C_{13}$, $\\sigma_{22} = C_{2233} = C_{13}$, and $\\sigma_{33} = C_{3333} = C_{33}$. Thus:\n    $$ \\mathbb{C}:\\boldsymbol{P} = C_{13}(\\boldsymbol{e}_1\\otimes\\boldsymbol{e}_1 + \\boldsymbol{e}_2\\otimes\\boldsymbol{e}_2) + C_{33}(\\boldsymbol{e}_3\\otimes\\boldsymbol{e}_3) = C_{13}\\boldsymbol{Q} + C_{33}\\boldsymbol{P} $$\n*   Action on $\\boldsymbol{Q} = \\boldsymbol{e}_1\\otimes\\boldsymbol{e}_1 + \\boldsymbol{e}_2\\otimes\\boldsymbol{e}_2$: The strain is $\\varepsilon_{11}=1, \\varepsilon_{22}=1$, others zero. The stress components are $\\sigma_{11} = C_{1111} + C_{1122} = C_{11}+C_{12}$, $\\sigma_{22} = C_{2211}+C_{2222} = C_{12}+C_{11}$, and $\\sigma_{33} = C_{3311}+C_{3322} = 2C_{13}$. Thus:\n    $$ \\mathbb{C}:\\boldsymbol{Q} = (C_{11}+C_{12})\\boldsymbol{Q} + 2C_{13}\\boldsymbol{P} $$\n\nWe find the eigenvalues by setting up the matrix representation of $\\mathbb{C}$ on the subspace spanned by $\\{\\boldsymbol{P}, \\boldsymbol{Q}\\}$. Let an eigen-tensor be $\\boldsymbol{E} = a\\boldsymbol{P} + b\\boldsymbol{Q}$. Then $\\mathbb{C}:\\boldsymbol{E} = \\lambda\\boldsymbol{E}$.\n$$ \\mathbb{C}:(a\\boldsymbol{P} + b\\boldsymbol{Q}) = a(C_{33}\\boldsymbol{P} + C_{13}\\boldsymbol{Q}) + b(2C_{13}\\boldsymbol{P} + (C_{11}+C_{12})\\boldsymbol{Q}) = \\lambda(a\\boldsymbol{P} + b\\boldsymbol{Q}) $$\nEquating coefficients of the orthogonal basis tensors $\\boldsymbol{P}$ and $\\boldsymbol{Q}$:\n$$ aC_{33} + 2bC_{13} = \\lambda a $$\n$$ aC_{13} + b(C_{11}+C_{12}) = \\lambda b $$\nThis is a homogeneous linear system for $(a, b)$.
