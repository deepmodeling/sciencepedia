This force is necessary to enforce the zero-displacement condition while accommodating the non-zero strain at the boundary, $\\epsilon(L) = -u_{0}\\frac{\\pi}{L}$.\nConversely, the higher-order traction at the boundary is zero, $q(L)=0$. In strain gradient elasticity, the boundary condition $q=0$ is analogous to a \"moment-free\" or \"strain-free\" condition. It implies that no higher-order generalized force is needed to sustain the strain gradient at the boundary. The sinusoidal displacement profile is such that the strain gradient $\\epsilon'$ is naturally zero at $x=0$ and $x=L$. Since the higher-order stress $\\mu$ is directly proportional to $\\epsilon'$, $\\mu$ is also zero at the boundaries. As $q = \\mu$, the higher-order traction is consequently zero. Therefore, this imposed displacement field is consistent with a set of boundary conditions where displacement is prescribed ($u=0$) and the higher-order traction is zero ($q=0$), analogous to a simply supported beam in classical beam theory.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-E u_{0} \\frac{\\pi}{L} \\left( 1 + \\ell^{2} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{L} \\right)^{2} \\right) & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2688443"}, {"introduction": "Having learned to identify the new stress and traction variables, the next critical step is understanding how to formulate a solvable problem.

The roots are $r=0$ (with multiplicity $2$), $r = \\frac{1}{\\ell}$, and $r = -\\frac{1}{\\ell}$.\nThe general solution for the displacement $u(x)$ is therefore:\n$$\nu(x) = C_1 + C_2 x + C_3 \\exp(x/\\ell) + C_4 \\exp(-x/\\ell)\n$$\nThis can be expressed more conveniently using hyperbolic functions:\n$$\nu(x) = A_1 + A_2 x + A_3 \\cosh(x/\\ell) + A_4 \\sinh(x/\\ell)\n$$\nNow we must impose the boundary conditions $t(0)=0$ and $t(L)=0$.

This is a direct consequence of the equilibrium equation, which can be integrated once to give $u''' - \\frac{1}{\\ell^2} u' = \\text{constant}$, which implies $t(x) = -E\\ell^2 \\times \\text{constant}$.\nThe boundary conditions $t(0)=0$ and $t(L)=0$ both lead to the same equation: $E A_2 = 0$. Since the Young's modulus $E$ is non-zero, this requires $A_2=0$.\nThe two prescribed boundary conditions are not independent; they collapse into a single algebraic constraint on the constants of integration.\nThe general solution has four arbitrary constants ($A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4$). The two (nominally) traction boundary conditions provide only one independent constraint ($A_2=0$). Therefore, $4 - 1 = 3$ constants remain undetermined.\nThe family of solutions that satisfy the given conditions is:\n$$\nu(x) = A_1 + A_3 \\cosh(x/\\ell) + A_4 \\sinh(x/\\ell)\n$$\nThis is a three-parameter family of functions, spanned by the basis functions $\\{1, \\cosh(x/\\ell), \\sinh(x/\\ell)\\}$. The dimension of this family of solutions is $3$.\n\nPart 3: Amending the boundary conditions for a well-posed problem.\nThe boundary value problem as specified in part 2) is ill-posed because it is under-determined. A fourth-order differential equation requires four independent boundary conditions for a unique solution (up to rigid-body modes). The provided specification $t(0)=t(L)=0$ only supplies one condition.\nTo formulate a well-posed problem, one must prescribe a total of four independent boundary conditions. In this higher-order theory, at each boundary point ($x=0$ and $x=L$), there are two power-conjugate pairs of variables: $(t, u)$ and $(m, u')$. A well-posed boundary value problem is formed by specifying exactly one variable from each pair at each boundary. This means for $x=0$, one must specify either $t(0)$ or $u(0)$, AND either $m(0)$ or $u'(0)$. A similar choice must be made at $x=L$.\nFor example, to model a bar clamped at $x=0$ and free at $x=L$, one would impose the following four independent boundary conditions, which ensure a unique solution:\n1.  At $x=0$, specified essential (kinematic) conditions: $u(0) = 0$ (no displacement).\n2.  At $x=0$, specified essential (kinematic) conditions: $u'(0) = 0$ (no rotation).\n3.  At $x=L$, specified natural (traction) conditions: $t(L) = 0$ (no classical traction).\n4.  At $x=L$, specified natural (traction) conditions: $m(L) = 0$ (no higher-order traction).\nThis set of four conditions is sufficient to uniquely determine the four constants $A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4$ in the general solution, thus yielding a unique displacement field. For the case of no external loading, as is the case here, this set of conditions yields the unique trivial solution $u(x)=0$.\n\nThe question asks for the dimension found in part 2.

The boundary contribution in $\\delta\\Pi$ is\n$$\n\\left[ \\big(EA\\,u' - (EA\\,\\ell^{2}\\,u'')'\\big)\\,\\delta u + EA\\,\\ell^{2}\\,u''\\,\\delta u' \\right]_{0}^{L} - T\\,\\delta u(L).\n$$\nThe prescribed essential boundary condition is $u(0)=0$, hence $\\delta u(0)=0$. The statement that both ends have free higher-order traction means the generalized traction conjugate to $\\delta u'$ vanishes at both ends:\n$$\nEA\\,\\ell^{2}\\,u''(0)=0, \\qquad EA\\,\\ell^{2}\\,u''(L)=0.\n$$\nAt $x=L$, $\\delta u(L)$ is arbitrary and the applied resultant force $T$ does work $-T\\,\\delta u(L)$, therefore the natural traction boundary condition at $x=L$ is\n$$\nEA\\,u'(L) - (EA\\,\\ell^{2}\\,u'')'(L) = T.\n$$\nAt $x=0$, $\\delta u(0)=0$ because $u(0)$ is prescribed, so no additional traction condition arises there beyond the higher-order one.\n\nWe now apply these boundary conditions to determine the constants. First compute derivatives:\n$$\nu'(x) = C_{2} + \\frac{C_{3}}{\\ell}\\,\\sinh\\!\\left(\\frac{x}{\\ell}\\right) + \\frac{C_{4}}{\\ell}\\,\\cosh\\!\\left(\\frac{x}{\\ell}\\right),\n$$\n$$\nu''(x) = \\frac{C_{3}}{\\ell^{2}}\\,\\cosh\\!\\left(\\frac{x}{\\ell}\\right) + \\frac{C_{4}}{\\ell^{2}}\\,\\sinh\\!\\left(\\frac{x}{\\ell}\\right),\n$$\n$$\nu'''(x) = \\frac{C_{3}}{\\ell^{3}}\\,\\sinh\\!\\left(\\frac{x}{\\ell}\\right) + \\frac{C_{4}}{\\ell^{3}}\\,\\cosh\\!\\left(\\frac{x}{\\ell}\\right).\n$$\nApply $u(0)=0$:\n$$\nu(0) = C_{1} + C_{3}\\,\\cosh(0) + C_{4}\\,\\sinh(0) = C_{1} + C_{3} = 0 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad C_{1} = -C_{3}.\n$$\nApply free higher-order traction at $x=0$: $EA\\,\\ell^{2}\\,u''(0)=0$ implies\n$$\nEA\\,\\ell^{2}\\,u''(0) = EA\\,\\ell^{2}\\left(\\frac{C_{3}}{\\ell^{2}}\\,\\cosh(0) + \\frac{C_{4}}{\\ell^{2}}\\,\\sinh(0)\\right) = EA\\,C_{3} = 0 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad C_{3}=0.\n$$\nTherefore $C_{1}=0$. Apply free higher-order traction at $x=L$: $EA\\,\\ell^{2}\\,u''(L)=0$ implies\n$$\nEA\\,\\ell^{2}\\,u''(L) = EA\\,\\ell^{2}\\left(\\frac{C_{3}}{\\ell^{2}}\\,\\cosh\\!\\left(\\frac{L}{\\ell}\\right) + \\frac{C_{4}}{\\ell^{2}}\\,\\sinh\\!\\left(\\frac{L}{\\ell}\\right)\\right) = EA\\left(C_{3}\\cosh\\!\\left(\\frac{L}{\\ell}\\right) + C_{4}\\sinh\\!\\left(\\frac{L}{\\ell}\\right)\\right).\n$$\nWith $C_{3}=0$ and $L>0$, $\\sinh(L/\\ell)\\neq 0$, hence\n$$\nEA\\,C_{4}\\,\\sinh\\!\\left(\\frac{L}{\\ell}\\right)=0 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad C_{4}=0.\n$$\nThus the displacement reduces to\n$$\nu(x)=C_{2}\\,x,\n$$\nand its derivatives are $u'(x)=C_{2}$, $u''(x)=0$.

Physically, for this uniform bar with free higher-order tractions at both ends, the higher-order terms do not contribute under uniform axial loading, so no size effect appears and the effective stiffness equals the classical result exactly.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2688538"}]}
