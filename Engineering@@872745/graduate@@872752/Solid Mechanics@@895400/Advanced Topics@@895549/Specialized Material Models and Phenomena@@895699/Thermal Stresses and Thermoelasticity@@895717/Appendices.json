All concepts, such as Young's modulus, thermal expansion coefficient, stress, and strain, are well-established scientific constructs.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. The geometry, material properties, loading, and boundary conditions are specified, and they lead to a unique and stable solution.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language without ambiguity or subjective elements.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The provided information is sufficient and self-consistent. The condition of perfect restraint is the key constraint that defines the problem.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution based on fundamental principles will now be derived.\n\nWe begin by establishing a coordinate system. Let the axis of the bar be aligned with the $x$-axis, with the bar occupying the domain $x \\in [0, L]$. Due to the uniform cross-section and the nature of the constraints and loading, this is a one-dimensional problem in terms of its mechanical response. The only non-zero displacement component is the axial displacement $u_x(x)$, and the only non-zero stress component of interest is the axial stress $\\sigma_{xx}(x)$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the fundamental equations of continuum mechanics.\n\nFirst, we consider the **balance of linear momentum**. For a quasi-static process with no body forces, the equilibrium equation in one dimension is:\n$$ \\frac{d\\sigma_{xx}}{dx} = 0 $$\nIntegrating this equation with respect to $x$ shows that the axial stress $\\sigma_{xx}$ must be constant along the length of the bar. We denote this constant stress as $\\sigma$:\n$$ \\sigma_{xx}(x) = \\sigma $$\n\nSecond, we state the **constitutive law** for a linear, isotropic, thermoelastic material in one dimension. The total axial strain $\\varepsilon_{xx}$ is the sum of the mechanical strain and the thermal strain. The mechanical strain is related to the stress via Young's modulus $E$, and the thermal strain $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{th}}$ is related to the temperature change $\\Delta T$ via the coefficient of thermal expansion $\\alpha$. The total strain is thus given by:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{xx} = \\frac{\\sigma_{xx}}{E} + \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{th}} $$\nThe thermal strain is defined as:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\alpha \\Delta T $$\nSubstituting this into the constitutive relation yields:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{xx} = \\frac{\\sigma_{xx}}{E} + \\alpha \\Delta T $$\n\nThird, we employ the **kinematic relationship** between strain and displacement. For small strains, the axial strain $\\varepsilon_{xx}$ is the spatial derivative of the axial displacement:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{xx} = \\frac{du_x}{dx} $$\n\nCombining these results, we substitute $\\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma$ into the constitutive equation. Since $E$, $\\alpha$, and $\\Delta T$ are all uniform constants, the axial strain $\\varepsilon_{xx}$ must also be constant along the length of the bar.\n\nFinally, we apply the **boundary condition**. The problem states that the bar is \"perfectly restrained at both ends\" such that its \"net axial elongation is prevented.\" This translates to a condition on the total change in length, $\\delta_L$. The total elongation is the integral of the axial strain $\\varepsilon_{xx}$ over the bar's length:\n$$ \\delta_L = \\int_0^L \\varepsilon_{xx} \\, dx $$\nThe constraint is that $\\delta_L = 0$.\n$$ \\int_0^L \\varepsilon_{xx} \\, dx = 0 $$\nSince we have established that $\\varepsilon_{xx}$ is a constant, the integral becomes:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{xx} \\int_0^L dx = \\varepsilon_{xx} L = 0 $$\nGiven that the length of the bar $L$ is non-zero, this requires the total axial strain to be zero everywhere:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{xx} = 0 $$\n\nNow, we substitute this kinematic result, $\\varepsilon_{xx} = 0$, back into the constitutive equation:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{\\sigma_{xx}}{E} + \\alpha \\Delta T $$\nSolving for the axial stress $\\sigma_{xx}$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_{xx}}{E} = -\\alpha \\Delta T $$\n$$ \\sigma_{xx} = -E \\alpha \\Delta T $$\nThis is the uniform axial Cauchy stress in the bar. The negative sign indicates that for a positive temperature increase ($\\Delta T > 0$), the stress is compressive, as expected for a constrained heated bar.

This practice moves beyond external constraints to explore the concept of internal self-stress arising from an incompatible thermal strain field.

It is a standard problem in the theory of linear thermoelasticity and can be solved from first principles.\n\nThe requirement is to find the necessary and sufficient condition on the temperature field $T(r)$ for the Cauchy stress tensor $\\sigma_{ij}$ to be identically zero throughout the hollow sphere. A state of zero stress is self-equilibrated, as the equilibrium equation in the absence of body forces, $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbf{0}$, is trivially satisfied. Furthermore, if the stress is zero everywhere in the body, it is necessarily zero at the boundaries, satisfying the traction-free conditions.\n\nThe analysis begins with the constitutive relation for a linear, isotropic, homogeneous thermoelastic solid, known as the Duhamel-Neumann law:\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij} = \\lambda \\varepsilon_{kk} \\delta_{ij} + 2\\mu \\varepsilon_{ij} - (3\\lambda + 2\\mu) \\alpha (T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}) \\delta_{ij}\n$$\nHere, $\\sigma_{ij}$ is the Cauchy stress tensor, $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ is the infinitesimal strain tensor, $\\varepsilon_{kk}$ is the trace of the strain tensor (volumetric strain), $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ are the Lamé constants, $\\alpha$ is the coefficient of linear thermal expansion, $T(r)$ is the temperature field, $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is the stress-free reference temperature, and $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nThe condition that the stress is zero everywhere, $\\sigma_{ij} = 0$, implies that the constitutive relation must be equal to zero. This can be solved for the strain tensor. It is convenient to express the relation in terms of the bulk modulus $K = \\lambda + \\frac{2}{3}\\mu$.

The total strain tensor from the kinematics must be compatible. A zero-stress state means the mechanical strain is zero, and thus the total strain must be purely thermal. Inverting the constitutive law, the strain tensor is given by:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\left( \\sigma_{ij} - \\frac{\\lambda}{3\\lambda+2\\mu} \\sigma_{kk} \\delta_{ij} \\right) + \\alpha (T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}) \\delta_{ij}\n$$\nSetting $\\sigma_{ij} = 0$ for all $i,j$ directly yields the necessary form of the strain tensor:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{ij} = \\alpha (T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}) \\delta_{ij}\n$$\nThis result signifies that for a stress-free state, the strain field must be purely dilatational (or spherical), with all normal components equal and all shear components zero.\n\nFor the given problem with spherical symmetry, the displacement field is purely radial, $\\mathbf{u} = u_r(r) \\mathbf{e}_r$. The non-zero components of the strain tensor in spherical coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$ are the radial strain, $\\varepsilon_{rr}$, and the two equal hoop strains, $\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta}$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\phi\\phi}$. These are related to the radial displacement $u_r(r)$ by the kinematic relations:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{rr} = \\frac{du_r}{dr}\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = \\varepsilon_{\\phi\\phi} = \\frac{u_r}{r}\n$$\nFrom our condition for zero stress, we must have:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{rr}(r) = \\alpha (T(r) - T_{\\mathrm{ref}})\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta}(r) = \\alpha (T(r) - T_{\\mathrm{ref}})\n$$\nThis implies $\\varepsilon_{rr} = \\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta}$.\n\nA strain field derived from a single-valued, continuous displacement field must satisfy the equations of compatibility. For a spherically symmetric strain field, the non-trivial compatibility equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta}}{dr} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{rr} - \\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta}}{r}\n$$\nThis equation ensures that the strain components are derivable from a displacement function $u_r(r)$.\n\nWe now impose this compatibility condition on the strain field required for a zero-stress state. Substituting $\\varepsilon_{rr} = \\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = \\alpha (T(r) - T_{\\mathrm{ref}})$ into the compatibility equation, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ \\alpha (T(r) - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}) \\right] = \\frac{\\alpha (T(r) - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}) - \\alpha (T(r) - T_{\\mathrm{ref}})}{r}\n$$\nSince $\\alpha$ and $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ are constants, the left side becomes $\\alpha \\frac{dT}{dr}$. The right side simplifies to zero:\n$$\n\\alpha \\frac{dT}{dr} = \\frac{0}{r} = 0\n$$\nFor any physical material, the coefficient of thermal expansion $\\alpha$ is a non-zero constant. Therefore, we must have:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dr} = 0\n$$\nThis is the necessary condition on the temperature distribution. It implies that the temperature $T$ must be constant with respect to the radius $r$. Let $T(r) = T_0$, where $T_0$ is a constant.\n\nTo confirm this condition is also sufficient, we assume $T(r) = T_0$. The strain field is then $\\varepsilon_{ij} = \\alpha(T_0-T_{\\mathrm{ref}})\\delta_{ij}$, which is a uniform dilatation. This strain field corresponds to a displacement $u_r = \\alpha(T_0-T_{\\mathrm{ref}})r$, which is single-valued and continuous, and it satisfies the compatibility equation as shown above. Substituting $\\varepsilon_{ij} = \\alpha(T_0-T_{\\mathrm{ref}})\\delta_{ij}$ and $T=T_0$ back into the original constitutive equation:\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij} = \\lambda [3\\alpha(T_0-T_{\\mathrm{ref}})] \\delta_{ij} + 2\\mu [\\alpha(T_0-T_{\\mathrm{ref}})\\delta_{ij}] - (3\\lambda + 2\\mu) \\alpha (T_0 - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}) \\delta_{ij}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij} = [ (3\\lambda + 2\\mu) - (3\\lambda + 2\\mu) ] \\alpha (T_0 - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}) \\delta_{ij} = 0\n$$\nThus, a uniform temperature field is also a sufficient condition for a zero-stress state.\n\nThe necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a stress-free state is that the temperature gradient in the radial direction is zero everywhere in the shell.

Let this far-field stress be denoted by $S$.\nThe problem is now reduced to an infinite plate with a traction-free hole subjected to a remote biaxial stress $\\sigma_{xx}^\\infty = \\sigma_{yy}^\\infty = S$. This is a classical axisymmetric problem. The hoop stress $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}$ is given by the Kirsch solution:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r) = S \\left(1 + \\frac{a^2}{r^2}\\right) $$\nAt the hole boundary, $r=a$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}|_{r=a} = S \\left(1 + \\frac{a^2}{a^2}\\right) = 2S = 2\\sigma_{xx}^\\infty $$\nThis stress is independent of the polar angle $\\theta$, as stated. The second part of the statement is also correct.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Statement C Analysis**\n\nIn Case X, the constraints at infinity are $\\varepsilon_{xx} \\to 0$ and\n$\\sigma_{yy}^{\\infty}=0$ (no constraint nor applied traction in the $y$-direction).\nFirst, find the far-field stress $\\sigma_{xx}^\\infty$ using the constitutive law for $\\varepsilon_{xx}$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{xx}^\\infty = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_{xx}^\\infty - \\nu \\sigma_{yy}^\\infty) + \\alpha \\Delta T $$\nSubstituting the given conditions $\\varepsilon_{xx}^\\infty = 0$ and $\\sigma_{yy}^\\infty = 0$:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_{xx}^\\infty - 0) + \\alpha \\Delta T \\implies \\sigma_{xx}^\\infty = -E \\alpha \\Delta T $$\nThe far-field stress is uniaxial, as stated. Let $S = \\sigma_{xx}^\\infty = -E \\alpha \\Delta T$.\nThe problem reduces to an infinite plate with a traction-free hole under remote uniaxial stress $S$ in the $x$-direction. The hoop stress at the hole boundary ($r=a$) from the Kirsch solution is:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}|_{r=a} = S(1 - 2\\cos(2\\theta)) $$\nWe seek the maximum magnitude of this stress. The value of $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}$ varies with angle $\\theta$:\n-   Maximum value occurs when $\\cos(2\\theta)=-1$ (i.e., $2\\theta = \\pi$, so $\\theta = \\pm \\pi/2$). At these points, $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = S(1 - 2(-1)) = 3S$.\n-   Minimum value occurs when $\\cos(2\\theta)=1$ (i.e., $2\\theta = 0$, so $\\theta = 0$). At this point, $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = S(1 - 2(1)) = -S$.\nThe stress varies between $-S$ and $3S$. The maximum magnitude is $|3S| = 3|S| = 3|\\sigma_{xx}^\\infty|$. This maximum magnitude occurs at $\\theta = \\pm \\pi/2$. All parts of the statement are consistent with the derivation.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Statement D Analysis**\n\nThis statement claims that in Case U (unconstrained), the curved hole boundary *must* generate stress because a uniform dilation cannot satisfy the traction-free boundary condition on a curved surface. This is fundamentally incorrect. As demonstrated in the analysis for Statement A, the state of zero stress, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}=\\mathbf{0}$, is a valid solution. The traction vector is given by $\\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$. If the stress tensor is zero everywhere, the traction vector is zero on *any* surface, regardless of its shape or orientation. The reasoning in the statement is fallacious.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Statement E Analysis**\n\nThis statement considers a hypothetical unconstrained orthotropic plate with thermal expansion coefficients $\\alpha_x \\neq \\alpha_y$. It claims that a uniform temperature change $\\Delta T$ will necessarily generate stress near the hole.\nThe thermal strain tensor is now anisotropic: $\\varepsilon_{xx}^{\\mathrm{th}} = \\alpha_x \\Delta T$, $\\varepsilon_{yy}^{\\mathrm{th}} = \\alpha_y \\Delta T$, $\\varepsilon_{xy}^{\\mathrm{th}} = 0$.\nTo determine if stress is generated, we check if a stress-free state is possible. A stress-free state requires the mechanical strain to be zero, which means the total strain must equal the thermal strain: $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{th}}$.\nFor this to be a valid strain state in a body, it must be compatible. A strain field is compatible if it can be derived from a single-valued, continuous displacement field. The compatibility condition in 2D is $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x^2} = 2 \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{xy}}{\\partial x \\partial y}$.\nSince $\\varepsilon_{xx}$, $\\varepsilon_{yy}$, and $\\varepsilon_{xy}$ are all constants, their second derivatives are all zero, and the compatibility equation ($0+0=0$) is satisfied. This means the strain field is compatible.\nThe corresponding single-valued displacement field is $u_x = (\\alpha_x \\Delta T) x$ and $u_y = (\\alpha_y \\Delta T) y$. Since this displacement field is single-valued, it is valid for a multiply-connected domain like a plate with a hole.\nThe state described by $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{th}}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbf{0}$ satisfies equilibrium and the traction-free boundary conditions. Therefore, it is the correct solution. No stress is generated. The statement is incorrect. The generation of thermal stresses in a homogeneous body depends on the incompatibility of the thermal strain field, not on its anisotropy. A uniform thermal strain field is always compatible.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "2920492"}]}
