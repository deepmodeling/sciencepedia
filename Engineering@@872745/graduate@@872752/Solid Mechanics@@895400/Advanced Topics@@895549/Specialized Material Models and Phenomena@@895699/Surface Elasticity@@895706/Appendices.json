However, a comparison with the flat-surface limit reveals the subtle but critical role of curvature.\n\nConsider a flat surface, for which the curvature is zero. The displacement field $\\mathbf{u} = \\gamma \\mathbf{x}$, when restricted to a plane (e.g., the $z=0$ plane), is purely tangential. The in-surface strain arises from the gradients of this tangential displacement. For this case, one obtains $\\varepsilon^{s}_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\gamma a_{\\alpha\\beta}$, representing a uniform biaxial stretching of the plane.\n\nNow consider the spherical surface, which has non-zero curvature. The displacement field $\\mathbf{u} = \\gamma \\mathbf{x}$, when evaluated on the sphere where $\\mathbf{x} = R \\mathbf{n}$, becomes $\\mathbf{u} = \\gamma R \\mathbf{n}$. This displacement is purely normal to the surface. For a purely normal displacement $u_n$, the surface strain is given by the general formula $\\varepsilon^{s}_{\\alpha\\beta} = -u_n b_{\\alpha\\beta}$, where $b_{\\alpha\\beta}$ are the components of the second fundamental form (or curvature tensor). For a sphere of radius $R$ with outward normal, $b_{\\alpha\\beta} = -\\frac{1}{R} a_{\\alpha\\beta}$. With $u_n = \\gamma R$, the strain is $\\varepsilon^{s}_{\\alpha\\beta} = -(\\gamma R)(-\\frac{1}{R} a_{\\alpha\\beta}) = \\gamma a_{\\alpha\\beta}$.\n\nIn summary, for the flat surface, the strain is generated by tangential displacement gradients. For the curved spherical surface, the strain is generated by the coupling of normal displacement with the surface curvature. The fact that the same bulk displacement field generates purely tangential motion on the plane and purely normal motion on the sphere, yet produces an identical expression for the surface strain, is a non-trivial consequence of the specific homogeneous form of $\\mathbf{u}$ and the constant curvature of the sphere. Thus, curvature is the essential mechanism that transduces the purely normal displacement into in-surface stretching in the spherical case. Without curvature, a purely normal displacement would induce zero in-surface strain.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\gamma a_{\\alpha\\beta}}$$", "id": "2692367"}, {"introduction": "We can now synthesize the geometric and kinematic concepts with a surface constitutive law to analyze a crucial physical phenomenon: surface stability.
