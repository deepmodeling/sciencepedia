Pre-stretch only deepens the mechanical energy well and monotonically delays instability without any trade-off; therefore, the areal strain at failure is maximized by taking $ \\lambda_p $ as large as possible.**\n**Incorrect.** This statement misses the critical trade-off. While pre-stretch increases mechanical stiffness and delays *pull-in* instability, it also thins the membrane. For a given applied voltage, a thinner membrane experiences a higher electric field ($E=\\Phi/h$), leading to larger Maxwell stresses and a lower threshold for *dielectric breakdown*. This competition creates an optimum, invalidating the claim that $ \\lambda_p $ should be as large as possible.\n\n**B. Pre-stretch increases mechanical stiffness (raising the energy curvature) while thinning the film, which amplifies Maxwell energy under voltage control; this creates a non-monotonic stability limit. The areal strain at failure is maximized when the pull-in field equals the material breakdown field in the current configuration, yielding an optimal equal-biaxial pre-stretch $ \\lambda_p \\approx 1.6 $ for the given parameters.**\n**Correct.** The physical explanation is accurate. Pre-stretch provides mechanical stiffening (stabilizing) but also enhances the electrical load for a given voltage (destabilizing with respect to breakdown), creating a trade-off. The optimization principle stated—equating the pull-in instability condition with the dielectric breakdown condition—is the correct method to find the pre-stretch that allows for the maximum possible actuation stretch. Our rigorous calculation gives $ \\lambda_p \\approx 1.57 $, which is very close to the stated $ 1.6 $. This option provides the correct physical reasoning and methodology.\n\n**C. Pre-stretch destabilizes the actuator because it reduces thickness, so the optimal strategy is zero pre-stretch, $ \\lambda_p = 1 $, for maximizing areal strain.**\n**Incorrect.** Pre-stretch, by stiffening the membrane, *stabilizes* it against pull-in instability, allowing it to withstand higher electric fields before snapping. The claim that it is purely destabilizing is false. Zero pre-stretch is generally not optimal, as a small amount of pre-stretch prevents premature pull-in and allows for much larger actuation strains.\n\n**D. The optimal pre-stretch is geometric and universal, independent of $ \\mu $, $ \\epsilon $, or $ E_{\\mathrm{bd}} $, and equals $ \\sqrt{2} $ for any DEA.**\n**Incorrect.** The optimal condition involves a balance between mechanical forces (governed by $ \\mu $) and electrical forces (governed by $ \\epsilon $ and limited by $ E_{\\mathrm{bd}} $). As shown in the derivation, the optimal stretch $ \\lambda^* $ is a function of the parameter group $ \\epsilon E_{\\mathrm{bd}}^2 / \\mu $. The optimal pre-stretch $ \\lambda_p $ in turn depends on $ \\lambda^* $. Therefore, the optimal pre-stretch is material-dependent, not a universal geometric constant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2635384"}]}
