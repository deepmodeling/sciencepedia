It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded exercise in the fundamental theory of linear elasticity for isotropic materials. All terms are standard, and the required data are provided. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe constitutive behavior of a homogeneous, isotropic, linear-elastic solid is completely described by two independent elastic constants. For problems involving stress and strain invariants, it is most convenient to use the bulk modulus, $K$, and the shear modulus, $G$. The constitutive law can be decomposed into a volumetric part and a deviatoric part. This decomposition is a direct consequence of isotropy, which dictates that the principal axes of stress and strain coincide and that the constitutive relationship is independent of the coordinate system orientation.\n\nThe volumetric response relates the mean stress, $p$, to the volumetric strain, which is the trace of the strain tensor, $\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})$. The relation is:\n$$p = K \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})$$\nHere, $p$ is defined as $p = \\frac{1}{3} \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})$, positive in tension. The trace of the strain tensor, $\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) = \\varepsilon_{kk}$, represents the change in volume per unit volume. This equation shows that the volumetric response is uncoupled from the deviatoric (shape-changing) part of the deformation. From this, we can express the trace of the strain tensor in terms of $p$ and $K$:\n$$\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) = \\frac{p}{K}$$\n\nThe deviatoric response relates the deviatoric stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{s}$, to the deviatoric strain tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}'$. The relation is:\n$$\\boldsymbol{s} = 2G \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}'$$\nHere, $\\boldsymbol{s} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - p\\boldsymbol{I}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}' = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} - \\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\boldsymbol{I}$. This equation shows that the deviatoric stress, which represents the part of the stress state causing shape change, induces only deviatoric strain, which represents pure shape change at constant volume. The factor of $2G$ is the proportionality constant.\n\nOur objective is to find the Frobenius norm of the total strain tensor, $||\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}||_{F} = \\sqrt{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}:\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}$. We must first express $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}:\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ in terms of its invariants. The strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ is decomposed as $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}' + \\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\boldsymbol{I}$. We compute the double dot product of $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ with itself:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}:\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\left(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}' + \\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\boldsymbol{I}\\right) : \\left(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}' + \\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\boldsymbol{I}\\right)$$\nExpanding this product gives:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}:\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}':\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}' + 2\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\right)(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}':\\boldsymbol{I}) + \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\right)^2(\\boldsymbol{I}:\\boldsymbol{I})$$\nBy definition, the deviatoric strain tensor is traceless, i.e., $\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}') = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}':\\boldsymbol{I} = 0$. Therefore, the cross-term vanishes. The double dot product of the second-order identity tensor $\\boldsymbol{I}$ with itself is $\\boldsymbol{I}:\\boldsymbol{I} = \\delta_{ij}\\delta_{ij} = 3$ in three dimensions. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}:\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}':\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}' + \\frac{1}{3}(\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}))^2$$\nThis is a standard result showing the orthogonal decomposition of the squared norm of a symmetric second-order tensor into its deviatoric and spherical parts.\n\nNow, we must express the two terms on the right-hand side using the given quantities $p$, $q$, $K$, and $G$.\nThe second term is straightforwardly obtained from the volumetric constitutive equation:\n$$(\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}))^2 = \\left(\\frac{p}{K}\\right)^2 = \\frac{p^2}{K^2}$$\nFor the first term, we use the deviatoric constitutive relation $\\boldsymbol{s} = 2G\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}'$ and the definition of the von Mises equivalent stress, $q = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}\\boldsymbol{s}:\\boldsymbol{s}}$. First, we find the double dot product of $\\boldsymbol{s}$ with itself:\n$$\\boldsymbol{s}:\\boldsymbol{s} = (2G\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}'):(2G\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}') = 4G^2(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}':\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}')$$\nNow, we relate this to $q$. Squaring the definition of $q$ gives:\n$$q^2 = \\frac{3}{2}\\boldsymbol{s}:\\boldsymbol{s}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\boldsymbol{s}:\\boldsymbol{s}$:\n$$q^2 = \\frac{3}{2}(4G^2(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}':\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}')) = 6G^2(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}':\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}')$$\nFrom this, we solve for the invariant $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}':\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}'$:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}':\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}' = \\frac{q^2}{6G^2}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute these results for $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}':\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}'$ and $(\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}))^2$ into the decomposed expression for $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}:\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}:\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{q^2}{6G^2} + \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{p^2}{K^2}\\right) = \\frac{q^2}{6G^2} + \\frac{p^2}{3K^2}$$\nThe Frobenius norm of the strain tensor is the square root of this quantity:\n$$||\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}||_{F} = \\sqrt{\\frac{p^2}{3K^2} + \\frac{q^2}{6G^2}}$$\n\nRegarding the discussion on coupling: The derivation itself demonstrates that for an isotropic material, the volumetric and deviatoric responses are uncoupled. The mean stress $p$ relates only to the volumetric strain $\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})$ via the bulk modulus $K$, and the deviatoric stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{s}$ relates only to the deviatoric strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}'$ via the shear modulus $G$. This uncoupling is at the level of invariants.\nHowever, this does not mean that individual normal strain components are uncoupled under a general multiaxial stress state. A finite Poisson's ratio, $\\nu$, which is a consequence of finite $K$ and $G$ (related by $K = E/(3(1-2\\nu))$ and $G=E/(2(1+\\nu))$), is precisely the mechanism for this component-level coupling. For example, the normal strain $\\varepsilon_{11}$ is given by Hooke's Law as $\\varepsilon_{11} = \\frac{1}{E}[\\sigma_{11} - \\nu(\\sigma_{22} + \\sigma_{33})]$. It is evident that a stress $\\sigma_{22}$ generates a strain in the a priori orthogonal direction $1$, provided $\\nu \\neq 0$. Thus, a finite Poisson's ratio (characterizing any realistic material with finite $K$ and $G$) couples the normal strain components. This component-wise coupling occurs in such a specific way that when the strain and stress components are aggregated into their invariant measures (volumetric and deviatoric), the resulting macroscopic response is perfectly decoupled.

The deviatoric strain is $e_{12} = \\epsilon_{12} = \\gamma/2$.\n    - The constitutive relation $s_{12} = 2 G e_{12}$ becomes $\\tau = 2G(\\gamma/2) = G\\gamma$.\n    - Therefore, $G = \\tau/\\gamma$. The shear modulus $G$ can be determined directly and robustly from this test. This test is a pure deviatoric probe and provides no information whatsoever about the volumetric response or $K$.\n\n2.  **Uniaxial Tension Test:**\n    In uniaxial tension, $\\sigma_{11} = \\sigma$ and all other stress components are zero. The strains are $\\epsilon_{11} = \\epsilon_{\\text{axial}}$ and $\\epsilon_{22} = \\epsilon_{33} = \\epsilon_{\\text{lateral}}$.\n    From these measurements, one can compute Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio:\n    $$ E = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon_{\\text{axial}}} $$\n    $$ \\nu = -\\frac{\\epsilon_{\\text{lateral}}}{\\epsilon_{\\text{axial}}} $$\n    The bulk modulus $K$ is then calculated from $K = E / (3(1-2\\nu))$. The determination of $K$ is critically sensitive to the value of $\\nu$ when $\\nu$ is close to $0.5$.\n    Let us analyze the propagation of uncertainty. The quantity of interest is $(1-2\\nu)$. The uncertainty in $\\nu$, denoted $\\Delta\\nu$, arises from uncertainties in strain measurements:\n    $$ \\Delta\\nu \\approx \\left| \\frac{\\partial \\nu}{\\partial \\epsilon_{\\text{lateral}}} \\right| \\Delta\\epsilon_{\\text{lateral}} + \\left| \\frac{\\partial \\nu}{\\partial \\epsilon_{\\text{axial}}} \\right| \\Delta\\epsilon_{\\text{axial}} = \\frac{1}{|\\epsilon_{\\text{axial}}|} \\Delta\\epsilon_{\\text{lateral}} + \\frac{|\\epsilon_{\\text{lateral}}|}{(\\epsilon_{\\text{axial}})^2} \\Delta\\epsilon_{\\text{axial}} $$\n    At the maximum axial strain $\\epsilon_{\\text{axial}} = 0.05$, and for $\\nu \\approx 0.5$, we have $|\\epsilon_{\\text{lateral}}| \\approx 0.5 \\times 0.05 = 0.025$. Using the given resolutions, $\\Delta\\epsilon_{\\text{lateral}} = 2 \\times 10^{-4}$ and $\\Delta\\epsilon_{\\text{axial}} = 5 \\times 10^{-5}$:\n    $$ \\Delta\\nu \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-4}}{0.05} + \\frac{0.025}{(0.05)^2} (5 \\times 10^{-5}) = 0.004 + 10 \\times (5 \\times 10^{-5}) = 0.004 + 0.0005 = 0.0045 $$\n    A typical nearly incompressible elastomer might have $\\nu = 0.498$. For this material, $1-2\\nu = 1-0.996 = 0.004$. The uncertainty in our measurement of $\\nu$ is $\\Delta\\nu \\approx 0.0045$, which is larger than the quantity $(0.5-\\nu) = 0.002$ that determines $K$. An uncertainty of this magnitude means the measured value of $1-2\\nu$ could be positive, negative, or zero, rendering the calculated value of $K$ completely meaningless.\n    The physical reason for this ill-conditioning is that a uniaxial test is predominantly deviatoric for a nearly incompressible material. The volumetric strain is $\\epsilon_v = \\epsilon_{\\text{axial}} + 2\\epsilon_{\\text{lateral}} = \\epsilon_{\\text{axial}}(1-2\\nu)$, which is very small. Attempting to determine the large bulk modulus $K$ from the relation $p = K\\epsilon_v$ with a very small $\\epsilon_v$ is an ill-conditioned problem.\n\nConclusion: The given tests can determine $G$ but not $K$ with acceptable engineering accuracy. An augmentation is required.\n\n**Analysis of Proposed Augmentations**\n\n- **Hydrostatic Compression Test:** This test applies a uniform hydrostatic pressure $p = -P_{\\text{H}}$ and measures the resulting volumetric strain $\\epsilon_v$. The bulk modulus is then given by $K = p/\\epsilon_v = -P_{\\text{H}}/\\epsilon_v$. This is the definitional experiment for $K$ and is the most direct and well-conditioned method to measure it.\n\n- **Elastic Wave Speed Measurement:** The speeds of compressional (P-waves, $c_P$) and shear (S-waves, $c_S$) waves are related to the elastic moduli and density $\\rho$ by:\n    $$ c_P^2 = \\frac{K + 4/3 G}{\\rho} $$\n    $$ c_S^2 = \\frac{G}{\\rho} $$\n    By measuring $c_P$, $c_S$, and $\\rho$, one can solve for $G$ and $K$:\n    $$ G = \\rho c_S^2 $$\n    $$ K = \\rho c_P^2 - \\frac{4}{3} G = \\rho (c_P^2 - \\frac{4}{3} c_S^2) $$\n    For a nearly incompressible material, $K \\gg G$, which implies $\\rho c_P^2 \\gg \\rho c_S^2$. The calculation for $K$ involves subtracting a relatively small, well-determined number from a large one, which is a well-conditioned operation. This method is also a robust way to find $K$.\n\n- **Equibiaxial Tensile Test:** This test imposes $\\sigma_{11} = \\sigma_{22} = \\sigma$, $\\sigma_{33} = 0$. The volumetric strain is $\\epsilon_v = \\frac{2\\sigma}{E}(1-2\\nu)$. The problem of having the small term $(1-2\\nu)$ persists. This test state is also predominantly deviatoric for nearly incompressible materials and suffers from the same ill-conditioning as the uniaxial test for determining $K$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nA. It is feasible: uniaxial and planar tests suffice to determine both $K$ and $G$ with good accuracy for nearly incompressible elastomers because the lateral strain directly gives the Poisson ratio close to $0.5$, from which $K$ and $G$ follow without further testing.\nThis is **Incorrect**. It fails to recognize the extreme sensitivity (ill-conditioning) of the calculation of $K$ to small errors in $\\nu$ when $\\nu$ is close to $0.5$. The uncertainty in $K$ would be unacceptably large.\n\nB. It is not feasible with acceptable uncertainty: uniaxial and planar tests predominantly probe deviatoric response, making $K$ poorly identifiable for nearly incompressible materials. Augment the protocol by adding a hydrostatic compression test to directly measure volumetric strain under hydrostatic pressure, or measure both compressional and shear elastic wave speeds (using the independently measured mass density) to extract $K$ and $G$.\nThis is **Correct**. It accurately identifies the source of the problem—the deviatoric nature of the tests leading to ill-conditioning for $K$—and proposes two standard, physically sound, and well-conditioned methods to measure $K$ directly (hydrostatic test) or indirectly (wave speeds).\n\nC. It is not feasible with the given two tests, but adding an equibiaxial tensile test alone is sufficient to identify $K$ robustly in nearly incompressible elastomers because it imposes a strong volumetric strain, obviating any need for hydrostatic loading or wave-speed measurements.\nThis is **Incorrect**. The claim that an equibiaxial test imposes a \"strong volumetric strain\" is false for nearly incompressible materials. As shown in the analysis, this test configuration suffers from the same ill-conditioning as the uniaxial test.\n\nD. It is feasible provided that Digital Image Correlation (DIC, Digital Image Correlation) is used in the uniaxial test to measure lateral strain with a resolution of $10^{-4}$; with that resolution, $K$ can be determined accurately from uniaxial data alone without additional tests.\nThis is **Incorrect**. The proposed resolution of $1 \\times 10^{-4}$ is only a factor of $2$ better than the given resolution of $2 \\times 10^{-4}$. While an improvement, it is insufficient to overcome the fundamental ill-conditioning of the problem. Our analysis showed that even with this improved resolution, the uncertainty in $K$ would still be on the order of several hundred percent, which is not \"accurate.\" A marginal improvement in precision cannot fix a fundamentally flawed experimental-computational procedure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2680107"}]}
