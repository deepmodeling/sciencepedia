I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe principle of virtual work states that the rate of change of stored energy is equal to the power expended by the stresses. For a hyperelastic material, we can work directly with the stored energy function. To incorporate the incompressibility constraint $J=1$, we introduce a modified energy functional using a Lagrange multiplier field $p$. We work with the energy density (energy per unit reference volume) and define a modified stored-energy function, $\\tilde{W}$:\n$$\n\\tilde{W}(\\boldsymbol{F}, p) = W(\\boldsymbol{C}(\\boldsymbol{F})) - p(J(\\boldsymbol{F}) - 1)\n$$\nThe second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{S}$, is energetically conjugate to the right Cauchy-Green tensor, $\\boldsymbol{C}$. Its relationship to the stored energy function is given by:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{S} = 2 \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{W}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{C}}\n$$\nWe substitute the expression for $\\tilde{W}$. Note that $J = \\det(\\boldsymbol{F}) = \\sqrt{\\det(\\boldsymbol{C})}$.\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{S} = 2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{C}} \\left[ \\frac{\\mu}{2}(\\operatorname{tr}\\boldsymbol{C} - 3) - p(\\sqrt{\\det\\boldsymbol{C}} - 1) \\right]\n$$\nThis requires us to compute two tensor derivatives.\nFirst, the derivative of the trace of $\\boldsymbol{C}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (\\operatorname{tr}\\boldsymbol{C})}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{C}} = \\boldsymbol{I}\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor.\nSecond, the derivative of the determinant of $\\boldsymbol{C}$. Using Jacobi's formula, $\\frac{\\partial (\\det\\boldsymbol{A})}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{A}} = (\\det\\boldsymbol{A})\\boldsymbol{A}^{-\\mathsf{T}}$, and noting that $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is symmetric, we have $\\frac{\\partial (\\det\\boldsymbol{C})}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{C}} = (\\det\\boldsymbol{C})\\boldsymbol{C}^{-1}$.\nNow we can find the derivative of $J = \\sqrt{\\det\\boldsymbol{C}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{C}} = \\frac{\\partial (\\det\\boldsymbol{C})^{1/2}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{C}} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\det\\boldsymbol{C})^{-1/2} \\frac{\\partial (\\det\\boldsymbol{C})}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{C}} = \\frac{1}{2J} (J^2 \\boldsymbol{C}^{-1}) = \\frac{J}{2} \\boldsymbol{C}^{-1}\n$$\nSubstituting these derivatives back into the expression for $\\boldsymbol{S}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{S} = 2 \\left[ \\frac{\\mu}{2} \\boldsymbol{I} - p \\left( \\frac{J}{2} \\boldsymbol{C}^{-1} \\right) \\right] = \\mu \\boldsymbol{I} - p J \\boldsymbol{C}^{-1}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress. The problem states that the incompressibility constraint $J=1$ holds. Applying this constraint simplifies the expression for $\\boldsymbol{S}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{S} = \\mu \\boldsymbol{I} - p \\boldsymbol{C}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, which is the true stress in the deformed configuration. The relationship between the Cauchy stress $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ and the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress $\\boldsymbol{S}$ is given by a push-forward operation:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\frac{1}{J} \\boldsymbol{F} \\boldsymbol{S} \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\n$$\nAgain, substituting $J=1$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{F} \\boldsymbol{S} \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\n$$\nWe now substitute the expression for $\\boldsymbol{S}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{F} (\\mu \\boldsymbol{I} - p \\boldsymbol{C}^{-1}) \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} = \\mu \\boldsymbol{F} \\boldsymbol{I} \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} - p \\boldsymbol{F} \\boldsymbol{C}^{-1} \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\n$$\nLet us simplify the two terms on the right-hand side.\nThe first term contains $\\boldsymbol{F}\\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}$, which is by definition the left Cauchy-Green tensor $\\boldsymbol{b}$.\n$$\n\\mu \\boldsymbol{F} \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} = \\mu \\boldsymbol{b}\n$$\nFor the second term, we use the definition $\\boldsymbol{C} = \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{F}$, which implies $\\boldsymbol{C}^{-1} = (\\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{F})^{-1} = \\boldsymbol{F}^{-1}(\\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}})^{-1} = \\boldsymbol{F}^{-1}\\boldsymbol{F}^{-\\mathsf{T}}$.\n$$\np \\boldsymbol{F} \\boldsymbol{C}^{-1} \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} = p \\boldsymbol{F} (\\boldsymbol{F}^{-1}\\boldsymbol{F}^{-\\mathsf{T}}) \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} = p (\\boldsymbol{F}\\boldsymbol{F}^{-1}) (\\boldsymbol{F}^{-\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}) = p \\boldsymbol{I} \\boldsymbol{I} = p\\boldsymbol{I}\n$$\nCombining the simplified terms yields the final expression for the Cauchy stress tensor:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mu \\boldsymbol{b} - p \\boldsymbol{I}\n$$\nThis is the constitutive equation for an incompressible neo-Hookean material. The physical meaning of the Lagrange multiplier $p$ is that of an indeterminate hydrostatic pressure. It is not a material parameter but a field variable that adjusts itself to maintain the kinematic constraint of incompressibility.\nTo show explicitly how $p$ enforces the constraint, consider the stationarity of the modified energy functional $\\Pi = \\int \\tilde{W} dV_0$ with respect to variations in the field $p$. The first variation $\\delta_p \\Pi$ must be zero:\n$$\n\\delta_p \\Pi = \\int_{V_0} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{W}}{\\partial p} \\delta p \\, dV_0 = \\int_{V_0} -(J-1) \\delta p \\, dV_0 = 0\n$$\nSince this must hold for any arbitrary variation $\\delta p$, the term multiplying it must vanish pointwise. This directly yields the constraint equation:\n$$\nJ - 1 = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad J = 1\n$$\nThus, the Lagrange multiplier $p$ is precisely the field whose governing equation is the incompressibility constraint itself.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mu \\boldsymbol{b} - p \\boldsymbol{I}}\n$$", "id": "2629895"}, {"introduction": "Building on the fundamentals, we now explore how the hyperelastic framework accommodates more sophisticated material descriptions.

It is a standard derivation in nonlinear solid mechanics. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe foundation of hyperelasticity is the existence of a scalar strain-energy density function, $W$, from which the stress state can be derived. For an incompressible, isotropic material, the Cauchy stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, is given by the sum of a deviatoric part derived from $W$ and a spherical part related to the indeterminate hydrostatic pressure, $p$. The pressure $p$ acts as a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the kinematic constraint of incompressibility, $J = \\det(\\mathbf{F}) = 1$, where $\\mathbf{F}$ is the deformation gradient.\n\nIn a principal coordinate system, where the basis vectors align with the principal directions of stretch, the tensors become diagonal. The principal Cauchy stresses, $\\sigma_i$, are related to the principal stretches, $\\lambda_i$, and the strain-energy density, $W$, by the following fundamental equation:\n$$\n\\sigma_i = \\lambda_i \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial \\lambda_i} - p \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}\n$$\nThis equation holds for an incompressible isotropic hyperelastic material where $W$ is expressed as a symmetric function of the principal stretches, and the derivative is taken treating the $\\lambda_i$ as independent variables.
