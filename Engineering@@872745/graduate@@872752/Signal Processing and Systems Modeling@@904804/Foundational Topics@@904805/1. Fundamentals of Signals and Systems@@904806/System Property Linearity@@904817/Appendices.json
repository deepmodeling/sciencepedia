The operator $S$ is well-defined because if $x(t)$ is a continuous function, then the translated functions $x(t-1)$ and $x(t+1)$ are also continuous, and their sum is therefore also a continuous function. Thus, $S$ maps $C(\\mathbb{R})$ to $C(\\mathbb{R})$ as stated. The concepts of linearity, time invariance, and memory are fundamental in this field.

A full analysis will be performed.\n\n**System Analysis**\n\nThe system $S$ is defined by the input-output relationship:\n$$ y(t) = (Sx)(t) = x(t-1) + x(t+1) $$\nWe will examine the properties of linearity, memory, and time invariance based on their foundational definitions.\n\n**1. Linearity**\nA system $S$ is linear if and only if it satisfies both the additivity and homogeneity properties.\nLet $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$ be two arbitrary input signals in $C(\\mathbb{R})$, and let $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$ be an arbitrary scalar.\n\n- **Additivity:** We must check if $S(x_1 + x_2) = S(x_1) + S(x_2)$.\nLet's compute the output for the input $(x_1 + x_2)(t) = x_1(t) + x_2(t)$:\n$$ (S(x_1 + x_2))(t) = (x_1 + x_2)(t-1) + (x_1 + x_2)(t+1) $$\nBy the definition of function addition:\n$$ (S(x_1 + x_2))(t) = [x_1(t-1) + x_2(t-1)] + [x_1(t+1) + x_2(t+1)] $$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$ (S(x_1 + x_2))(t) = [x_1(t-1) + x_1(t+1)] + [x_2(t-1) + x_2(t+1)] $$\nWe recognize that the terms in the brackets are the outputs for $x_1$ and $x_2$ individually:\n$$ (S(x_1 + x_2))(t) = (Sx_1)(t) + (Sx_2)(t) $$\nSince this holds for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $S(x_1 + x_2) = S(x_1) + S(x_2)$. The additivity property is satisfied.\n\n- **Homogeneity:** We must check if $S(ax_1) = a S(x_1)$.\nLet's compute the output for the input $(ax_1)(t) = a x_1(t)$:\n$$ (S(ax_1))(t) = (ax_1)(t-1) + (ax_1)(t+1) $$\nBy the definition of scalar multiplication of functions:\n$$ (S(ax_1))(t) = a x_1(t-1) + a x_1(t+1) $$\nFactoring out the scalar $a$:\n$$ (S(ax_1))(t) = a [x_1(t-1) + x_1(t+1)] $$\nThe term in the brackets is the output for $x_1$:\n$$ (S(ax_1))(t) = a(Sx_1)(t) $$\nSince this holds for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $S(ax_1) = a S(x_1)$. The homogeneity property is satisfied.\n\nSince both additivity and homogeneity are satisfied, the system $S$ is **linear**.\n\n**2. Memory**\nA system is memoryless if its output $y(t)$ at any time $t_0$ depends only on the input value $x(t_0)$ at that same time. Otherwise, the system has memory.\n\nThe output of the system is given by:\n$$ y(t) = (Sx)(t) = x(t-1) + x(t+1) $$\nTo calculate the output $y(t_0)$ at a specific time $t_0$, we need to know the input values $x(t_0-1)$ and $x(t_0+1)$. These are values of the input at a past time ($t_0-1$) and a future time ($t_0+1$). Since the output depends on input values at times other than the present time $t_0$, the system is not memoryless.\n\nTherefore, the system $S$ **has memory**.\n\n**3. Time Invariance**\nA system $S$ is time-invariant if a time shift in the input signal results in an identical time shift in the output signal. Formally, let $T_\\tau$ be the operator that shifts a signal by $\\tau$, i.e., $(T_\\tau x)(t) = x(t-\\tau)$. A system $S$ is time-invariant if it commutes with $T_\\tau$ for any $\\tau \\in \\mathbb{R}$, which is to say $S T_\\tau = T_\\tau S$. We must verify if $(S(T_\\tau x))(t) = (T_\\tau(Sx))(t)$ for all $t$ and $\\tau$.\n\n- First, we find the output of the system for a shifted input, $x_\\tau(t) = (T_\\tau x)(t) = x(t-\\tau)$.\n$$ (S(T_\\tau x))(t) = (S x_\\tau)(t) = x_\\tau(t-1) + x_\\tau(t+1) $$\nSubstituting the definition of $x_\\tau(t)$:\n$$ (S(T_\\tau x))(t) = x((t-1)-\\tau) + x((t+1)-\\tau) = x(t-\\tau-1) + x(t-\\tau+1) $$\n\n- Second, we find the shifted version of the original output. Let $y(t) = (Sx)(t) = x(t-1) + x(t+1)$.\n$$ (T_\\tau(Sx))(t) = (T_\\tau y)(t) = y(t-\\tau) $$\nSubstituting the definition of $y(t)$:\n$$ (T_\\tau(Sx))(t) = x((t-\\tau)-1) + x((t-\\tau)+1) = x(t-\\tau-1) + x(t-\\tau+1) $$\n\nComparing the two results, we see that $(S(T_\\tau x))(t) = (T_\\tau(Sx))(t)$ for all $t, \\tau \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The system's operation commutes with the time-shift operation.\n\nTherefore, the system $S$ is **time-invariant**.\n\n**Conclusion Summary**\n- The system $S$ is **linear**.\n- The system $S$ **has memory**.\n- The system $S$ is **time-invariant**.\n\n**Option Evaluation**\n\nA. $S$ is nonlinear, memoryless, and time-invariant.\n**Incorrect.** Our analysis shows that $S$ is linear and has memory.\n\nB. $S$ is linear, has memory, and is time-invariant.\n**Correct.** This classification matches our derived properties precisely.\n\nC. $S$ is linear, memoryless, and time-varying.\n**Incorrect.** Our analysis shows that $S$ has memory and is time-invariant.\n\nD. $S$ is nonlinear, has memory, and is time-varying.\n**Incorrect.** Our analysis shows that $S$ is linear and time-invariant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2909796"}, {"introduction": "Having established a baseline with an LTI system, we now explore the important case where linearity is present but time-invariance is not.

The problem is self-contained, scientifically sound, and well-posed. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. We may proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe analysis will proceed by testing the system against the formal definitions of each property.\n\n**1. Linearity**\nA system $S$ is linear if it satisfies the superposition principle. For any two input signals $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$ and any two scalars $a_1, a_2 \\in \\mathbb{F}$, the following relation must hold:\n$$S[a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2] = a_1 S[x_1] + a_2 S[x_2]$$\nLet us test the left-hand side (LHS) of this equation. Consider a composite input signal $x(t) = a_1 x_1(t) + a_2 x_2(t)$. The output $y(t)$ is:\n$$y(t) = S[x(t)] = S[a_1 x_1(t) + a_2 x_2(t)] = t^2 [a_1 x_1(t) + a_2 x_2(t)]$$\nBy distributing the $t^2$ term, we get:\n$$y(t) = a_1 t^2 x_1(t) + a_2 t^2 x_2(t)$$\nNow, let us evaluate the right-hand side (RHS). The outputs corresponding to $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$ are $y_1(t) = S[x_1(t)] = t^2 x_1(t)$ and $y_2(t) = S[x_2(t)] = t^2 x_2(t)$, respectively. The linear combination of these outputs is:\n$$a_1 S[x_1(t)] + a_2 S[x_2(t)] = a_1 y_1(t) + a_2 y_2(t) = a_1 (t^2 x_1(t)) + a_2 (t^2 x_2(t))$$\nComparing the results for the LHS and RHS, we see they are identical for all $t$. Therefore, the system satisfies the superposition principle and is **linear**.\n\n**2. Time Invariance**\nA system is time-invariant if a time shift in the input signal results in an identical time shift in the output signal. Let $y(t) = S[x(t)]$ be the output for an arbitrary input $x(t)$. The system is time-invariant if for any time shift $t_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the output produced by the shifted input $x(t-t_0)$ is equal to the shifted output $y(t-t_0)$. That is, we must check if $S[x(t-t_0)](t) = y(t-t_0)$.\n\nFirst, let us determine the output due to a shifted input. Let the input be $x_d(t) = x(t-t_0)$. The system's output, which we shall call $y_d(t)$, is:\n$$y_d(t) = S[x_d(t)] = t^2 x_d(t) = t^2 x(t-t_0)$$\nNext, let us determine the shifted original output. The original output is $y(t) = t^2 x(t)$. To obtain the shifted output $y(t-t_0)$, we substitute $t$ with $(t-t_0)$ in the expression for $y(t)$:\n$$y(t-t_0) = (t-t_0)^2 x(t-t_0)$$\nNow, we compare $y_d(t)$ and $y(t-t_0)$. For the system to be time-invariant, we must have $y_d(t) = y(t-t_0)$ for all $t$ and any choice of $t_0$.\n$$t^2 x(t-t_0) = (t-t_0)^2 x(t-t_0)$$\nThis equality must hold for any input signal $x(t)$. Assuming there exists some $t$ where $x(t-t_0) \\neq 0$, the equality simplifies to:\n$$t^2 = (t-t_0)^2$$\nFor a non-zero shift, say $t_0 = 1$, this becomes $t^2 = (t-1)^2 = t^2 - 2t + 1$, which implies $2t-1=0$, or $t=1/2$. Since this equality does not hold for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the system is **not time-invariant**. It is **time-varying**. The system's behavior, characterized by the coefficient $t^2$, explicitly depends on the absolute time $t$.\n\n**3. Memorylessness**\nA system is memoryless (or static) if its output at any time $t_0$ depends only on the input value at that same instant $t_0$. It must not depend on past or future values of the input.\nThe input-output relation is given by:\n$$y(t) = t^2 x(t)$$\nLet us evaluate the output at an arbitrary time $t_0$:\n$$y(t_0) = t_0^2 x(t_0)$$\nThe value of the output $y(t_0)$ is determined by the value of the time variable $t_0$ and the value of the input signal $x(t_0)$ at that exact moment. No other values of the input, such as $x(t)$ for $t \\neq t_0$, are required to compute $y(t_0)$. Therefore, the system is **memoryless**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, the system $S$ defined by $y(t) = t^2 x(t)$ is linear, time-varying, and memoryless.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A.

This is the identity operator, $S=I$.\n    The identity operator is linear: $S[\\alpha x_1 + \\beta x_2] = \\alpha x_1 + \\beta x_2 = \\alpha S[x_1] + \\beta S[x_2]$ for all $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $x_1, x_2 \\in X$.\n    Thus, if $\\theta=0$, $S$ is linear.\n\n*   **Case 2: `only if` $S$ is linear.** (We prove the contrapositive: if $\\theta>0$, $S$ is not linear).\n    Let $\\theta > 0$. We test for homogeneity, $S[\\alpha x] = \\alpha S[x]$.\n    Let $x(t) = c$ be a constant function, where $0  c  \\theta$.

This holds for any $\\theta \\ge 0$.\n    \nBoth properties hold. Statement C is **Correct**.\n\n**D. For any $\\theta>0$, there exist $x,y \\in X$ such that $S[x+y]\\neq S[x]+S[y]$.**\n\nThis statement claims that for any $\\theta>0$, the operator $S$ is not additive.\nLet $\\theta > 0$.

Both are in $X$.\nFor $x(t)$, $|x(t)| = \\theta/2  \\theta$, so $S[x]=0$.\nFor $y(t)$, $|y(t)| = \\theta/2  \\theta$, so $S[y]=0$.\nTherefore, $(S[x]+S[y])(t) = 0$.\nNow consider the sum signal $(x+y)(t) = \\theta/2 + \\theta/2 = \\theta$.\nFor this signal, $|(x+y)(t)| = \\theta$, so the condition $|(x+y)(t)| \\ge \\theta$ is satisfied.\n$S[x+y](t) = (x+y)(t) = \\theta$.\nSince $\\theta>0$, we have $S[x+y](t) = \\theta \\neq 0 = (S[x]+S[y])(t)$.\nThus, such signals $x$ and $y$ exist for any $\\theta>0$.

The set $W$ is not a vector subspace of $X$. For example, let $\\theta>0$. Let $x_1(t)=\\theta$ and $x_2(t)=-\\theta$. Both $x_1$ and $x_2$ are in $W$ since $\\operatorname*{ess\\,inf}_{t}|x_1(t)| = \\theta$ and $\\operatorname*{ess\\,inf}_{t}|x_2(t)| = \\theta$. However, their sum $(x_1+x_2)(t) = 0$, so $\\operatorname*{ess\\,inf}_{t}|(x_1+x_2)(t)|=0  \\theta$, which means $x_1+x_2 \\notin W$.\n\nEven if we just check the linearity condition for all elements in $W$, it fails.\nFor any $x\\in W$, we have $|x(t)| \\ge \\theta$ for almost all $t$. This means $S[x]=x$. The operator $S$ acts as the identity on $W$.\nFor the restriction to be linear, we require $S[\\alpha x_1 + \\beta x_2] = \\alpha S[x_1] + \\beta S[x_2]$ for all $x_1, x_2 \\in W$ and $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nUsing $S[x_1] = x_1$ and $S[x_2] = x_2$, the condition becomes $S[\\alpha x_1 + \\beta x_2] = \\alpha x_1 + \\beta x_2$.\nThis requires $S$ to act as the identity on the signal $y = \\alpha x_1 + \\beta x_2$, which is true if and only if $y \\in W$. As shown, $W$ is not closed under linear combinations, so this is not guaranteed.\nLet's use a specific counterexample for homogeneity. Let $\\theta > 0$.\nLet $x(t) = 2\\theta$. Then $\\operatorname*{ess\\,inf}_{t}|x(t)| = 2\\theta > \\theta$, so $x \\in W$.\nWe have $S[x]=x=2\\theta$.\nLet $\\alpha = 1/4$. The signal $(\\alpha x)(t) = (1/4)(2\\theta) = \\theta/2$.\nThen $|(\\alpha x)(t)| = \\theta/2  \\theta$.\nSo, $S[\\alpha x](t)=0$.\nHowever, $\\alpha S[x](t) = (1/4)x(t) = (1/4)(2\\theta) = \\theta/2$.\nSince $0 \\neq \\theta/2$, homogeneity fails. The restriction is not linear. Statement E is **Incorrect**.\n\n**F. If a fixed input $x\\in X$ satisfies $\\operatorname*{ess\\,inf}_{t}|x(t)|\\theta$, then there exists $\\varepsilon0$ such that for all $h\\in X$ with $\\|h\\|_{\\infty}\\varepsilon$ one has $S[x+h]=S[x]+h$; if instead $\\operatorname*{ess\\,sup}_{t}|x(t)|\\theta$, then there exists $\\varepsilon0$ such that for all $h\\in X$ with $\\|h\\|_{\\infty}\\varepsilon$ one has $S[x+h]=0$.**\n\n*   **Part 1:** Assume $\\operatorname*{ess\\,inf}_{t}|x(t)|>\\theta$. Let $\\delta = \\operatorname*{ess\\,inf}_{t}|x(t)| - \\theta$. By assumption, $\\delta > 0$. This means $|x(t)| \\ge \\theta+\\delta$ for almost every $t$.\n    Let $\\varepsilon=\\delta$. For any $h \\in X$ with $\\|h\\|_{\\infty}  \\varepsilon$, we have $|h(t)|  \\varepsilon$ for almost every $t$.\n    By the reverse triangle inequality, $|x(t)+h(t)| \\ge |x(t)| - |h(t)| \\ge (\\theta+\\delta) - |h(t)|$.\n    Since $|h(t)| \\le \\|h\\|_{\\infty}  \\varepsilon = \\delta$, we have $|x(t)+h(t)| > (\\theta+\\delta) - \\delta = \\theta$ for almost every $t$.\n    This implies $S[x+h](t) = (x+h)(t)$ almost everywhere, so $S[x+h]=x+h$.\n    Also, since $|x(t)| \\ge \\theta+\\delta > \\theta$ a.e., we have $S[x]=x$.\n    Thus, $S[x]+h=x+h$. We have shown $S[x+h] = S[x]+h$. This part is true.\n\n*   **Part 2:** Assume $\\operatorname*{ess\\,sup}_{t}|x(t)|\\theta$. Let $\\delta = \\theta - \\operatorname*{ess\\,sup}_{t}|x(t)|$. By assumption, $\\delta > 0$. This means $|x(t)| \\le \\theta-\\delta$ for almost every $t$.\n    Let $\\varepsilon=\\delta$. For any $h \\in X$ with $\\|h\\|_{\\infty}  \\varepsilon$, we have $|h(t)|  \\varepsilon$ for almost every $t$.\n    By the triangle inequality, $|x(t)+h(t)| \\le |x(t)| + |h(t)| \\le (\\theta-\\delta) + |h(t)|$.\n    Since $|h(t)| \\le \\|h\\|_{\\infty}  \\varepsilon = \\delta$, we have $|x(t)+h(t)|  (\\theta-\\delta) + \\delta = \\theta$ for almost every $t$.\n    This implies $S[x+h](t) = 0$ for almost every $t$, so $S[x+h]=0$. This part is true.\n    \nSince both parts of the statement hold, statement F is **Correct**.\n\n**G. For any $\\theta>0$, the only linear subspace $U\\subseteq X$ on which the restriction of $S$ is linear is the zero subspace $U=\\{0\\}$.**\n\nLet $U$ be a linear subspace of $X$ on which the restriction of $S$ is linear, denoted $S|_U$. Let $\\theta>0$.\nThis means that for any $x_1, x_2 \\in U$ and $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $S[\\alpha x_1 + \\beta x_2] = \\alpha S[x_1] + \\beta S[x_2]$.\nLet's prove that any element $x \\in U$ must be the zero signal.\nSince $U$ is a subspace, for any $x \\in U$ and any integer $n \\ge 1$, the signal $nx = x + ... + x$ ($n$ times) is also in $U$.\nFirst, we show that for any $x \\in U$, we must have $|x(t)|  \\theta$ almost everywhere (a.e.). Assume for contradiction that there exists an $x_0 \\in U$ and a set $A$ with measure $\\mu(A)>0$ such that for $t \\in A$, $|x_0(t)| \\ge \\theta$. Then for $t \\in A$, $S[x_0](t)=x_0(t)$. Linearity on $U$ implies homogeneity, so $S[\\alpha x_0]=\\alpha S[x_0]$ for all $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Choose $\\alpha$ such that $0  |\\alpha|  \\theta / \\|x_0\\|_{\\infty}$. Then $|\\alpha x_0(t)|  \\theta$ for all $t \\in A$. This means $S[\\alpha x_0](t)=0$ for $t \\in A$. But $\\alpha S[x_0](t) = \\alpha x_0(t) \\neq 0$ for $t \\in A$. This is a contradiction, so we must have $|x(t)|  \\theta$ a.e. for all $x \\in U$.\nThis implies $S[x]=0$ for all $x \\in U$.\n\nNow, using additivity on $U$, for any $x_1, x_2 \\in U$, we have $S[x_1+x_2] = S[x_1]+S[x_2] = 0+0=0$.\nThis implies that for any $x_1, x_2 \\in U$, we must have $|x_1(t)+x_2(t)|  \\theta$ a.e.\nLet $x_0$ be an arbitrary element of $U$.\nThen $x_0+x_0=2x_0$ is in $U$. So $|2x_0(t)|  \\theta$ a.e. This means $2\\|x_0\\|_{\\infty} \\le \\theta$, or $\\|x_0\\|_{\\infty} \\le \\theta/2$.\nApplying this again, $2x_0+2x_0=4x_0$ is in $U$. So $|4x_0(t)|  \\theta$ a.e. This means $4\\|x_0\\|_{\\infty} \\le \\theta$, or $\\|x_0\\|_{\\infty} \\le \\theta/4$.\nBy induction, for any integer $k \\ge 1$, $2^k x_0 \\in U$, so we must have $|2^k x_0(t)|  \\theta$ a.e., which implies $\\|x_0\\|_{\\infty} \\le \\theta/2^k$.\nThis must hold for all $k \\ge 1$. As $k \\to \\infty$, $\\theta/2^k \\to 0$.\nThis forces $\\|x_0\\|_{\\infty} \\le 0$. Since the norm is non-negative, $\\|x_0\\|_{\\infty} = 0$.\nIn $L^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R})$, $\\|x_0\\|_{\\infty}=0$ implies $x_0=0$ (the zero signal).\nSince $x_0$ was an arbitrary element of $U$, every element of $U$ must be the zero signal.\nThus, $U$ must be the zero subspace, $U=\\{0\\}$.
