A system is BIBO stable if and only if for every bounded input signal $u(t)$, the corresponding output signal $y(t)$ is also bounded. An input $u(t)$ is considered bounded if there exists a finite positive constant $M_u$ such that $|u(t)| \\le M_u$ for all $t$ in the domain of interest. Similarly, an output $y(t)$ is bounded if there exists a finite positive constant $M_y$ such that $|y(t)| \\le M_y$ for all $t$. To demonstrate that a system is not BIBO stable, it is sufficient to find one specific example of a bounded input that produces an unbounded output.\n\nThe system is described by the equation:\n$$\ny(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} u(\\tau)\\, d\\tau, \\quad t \\ge 0\n$$\n\nThe problem proposes using the specific input signal $u(t) = \\frac{1}{1+t}$ for $t \\ge 0$. We must first verify that this input is bounded. The function $u(t)$ is a monotonically decreasing function for $t \\ge 0$. Its maximum value occurs at $t=0$, where $u(0) = \\frac{1}{1+0} = 1$. As $t \\to \\infty$, $u(t) \\to 0$. Therefore, for all $t \\ge 0$, the input signal satisfies $0  u(t) \\le 1$. We can thus state that $|u(t)| \\le 1$ for all $t \\ge 0$. This confirms that $u(t)$ is a bounded input, with a bound $M_u = 1$.\n\nNext, we compute the output $y(t)$ corresponding to this bounded input. We substitute $u(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{1+\\tau}$ into the system equation:\n$$\ny(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{1}{1+\\tau}\\, d\\tau\n$$\n\nThis is a standard integral. Let us perform the integration. The antiderivative of $\\frac{1}{1+\\tau}$ with respect to $\\tau$ is $\\ln|1+\\tau|$.

The solution must be derived from first principles.\n\nFirst, we establish the necessary and sufficient condition for BIBO stability for any discrete-time LTI system with a real-valued impulse response $h[n]$. A system is defined as BIBO-stable if every bounded input produces a bounded output. A bounded input $x[n]$ satisfies $|x[n]| \\le M_x  \\infty$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, where $M_x$ is a finite positive constant. The output $y[n]$ must then satisfy $|y[n]| \\le M_y  \\infty$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, where $M_y$ is some other finite positive constant.\n\nThe output $y[n]$ of an LTI system is given by the convolution sum:\n$$y[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[k] x[n-k]$$\nTo find a bound on the output magnitude, we take the absolute value of both sides:\n$$|y[n]| = \\left| \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[k] x[n-k] \\right|$$\nApplying the triangle inequality, we get:\n$$|y[n]| \\le \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h[k] x[n-k]| = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h[k]| |x[n-k]|$$\nSince the input is bounded, $|x[n-k]| \\le M_x$ for all $k$. Substituting this into the inequality yields:\n$$|y[n]| \\le \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h[k]| M_x = M_x \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h[k]|$$\nIf the sum $S = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h[k]|$ is finite, i.e., $S  \\infty$, then the output is bounded, $|y[n]| \\le M_x S$. The product $M_x S$ is a finite constant, so we can set $M_y = M_x S$. This shows that the condition that the impulse response is absolutely summable, $S  \\infty$, is a sufficient condition for BIBO stability.\n\nTo demonstrate necessity, we must show that if $S = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h[k]| = \\infty$, the system is not BIBO-stable. To do this, we construct a specific bounded input that produces an unbounded output. Let us choose the input signal $x[n]$ as:\n$$x[n] = \\text{sgn}(h[-n]) = \\begin{cases} 1,  h[-n] > 0 \\\\ -1,  h[-n]  0 \\\\ 0,  h[-n] = 0 \\end{cases}$$\nThis input is clearly bounded, as $|x[n]| \\le 1$ for all $n$. Now, we examine the output at the specific time instant $n=0$:\n$$y[0] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[k] x[-k]$$\nWith our choice of $x[n]$, we have $x[-k] = \\text{sgn}(h[k])$. The output at $n=0$ is then:\n$$y[0] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[k] \\text{sgn}(h[k])$$\nFor any real number $a$, the product $a \\cdot \\text{sgn}(a)$ is equal to $|a|$. Therefore, $h[k] \\text{sgn}(h[k]) = |h[k]|$. The output becomes:\n$$y[0] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h[k]| = S$$\nBy our assumption, $S$ is infinite. Thus, for the bounded input $x[n]=\\text{sgn}(h[-n])$, the output $y[0]$ is unbounded. This violates the definition of BIBO stability. Consequently, the condition $S = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h[k]|  \\infty$ is also necessary.\n\nThe necessary and sufficient condition for BIBO stability of an LTI system is that its impulse response must be absolutely summable.\n\nWe now apply this condition to the specific system provided, which has the impulse response:\n$$h[n] \\;=\\; \\begin{cases} (1+n)^{-\\alpha},  n \\geq 0,\\\\ 0,  n0, \\end{cases}$$\nThe stability condition is $\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h[n]|  \\infty$. Since the system is causal ($h[n]=0$ for $n0$), the sum starts from $n=0$:\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} |(1+n)^{-\\alpha}|  \\infty$$\nFor $n \\ge 0$, the term $1+n$ is always positive. Hence, $(1+n)^{-\\alpha}$ is real and positive, and $|(1+n)^{-\\alpha}| = (1+n)^{-\\alpha}$. The stability condition simplifies to:\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (1+n)^{-\\alpha}  \\infty$$\nTo analyze this series, we perform a change of index by letting $k = n+1$. For $n=0$, $k=1$. As $n \\to \\infty$, $k \\to \\infty$. The series becomes:\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k^{-\\alpha}$$\nThis is a p-series. As per the problem instructions, we must determine its convergence using a first-principles test. We analyze the behavior for different ranges of $\\alpha$.\n\nIf $\\alpha \\le 0$, the term $a_k = k^{-\\alpha}$ does not converge to $0$ as $k \\to \\infty$. If $\\alpha=0$, $a_k = 1$ for all $k$. If $\\alpha  0$, $a_k = k^{|\\alpha|}$, which diverges to infinity. In either case, since $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} a_k \\neq 0$, the series diverges by the term test for divergence. Thus, for stability, we must have $\\alpha  0$.\n\nFor $\\alpha  0$, consider the function $f(x) = x^{-\\alpha}$ for $x \\ge 1$. This function is continuous, positive, and decreasing on its domain. Therefore, we can apply the integral test for convergence. The series $\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k^{-\\alpha}$ converges if and only if the improper integral $\\int_{1}^{\\infty} x^{-\\alpha} dx$ converges.\n\nWe must evaluate this integral.\nCase 1: The borderline case, $\\alpha = 1$.

Therefore, the series also diverges for $\\alpha=1$. The system is unstable at this borderline value.\n\nCase 2: $\\alpha  0$ and $\\alpha \\neq 1$. The integral is:\n$$\\int_{1}^{\\infty} x^{-\\alpha} dx = \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\left[ \\frac{x^{-\\alpha+1}}{-\\alpha+1} \\right]_{1}^{b} = \\frac{1}{1-\\alpha} \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} (b^{1-\\alpha} - 1)$$\nThe convergence of this expression depends on the sign of the exponent $1-\\alpha$.\nIf $1-\\alpha  0$ (i.e., $0  \\alpha  1$), then $\\lim_{b \\to \\infty} b^{1-\\alpha} = \\infty$, and the integral diverges.\nIf $1-\\alpha  0$ (i.e., $\\alpha  1$), then $\\lim_{b \\to \\infty} b^{1-\\alpha} = 0$. The integral converges to a finite value: $\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}(0-1) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha-1}$.\n\nCombining all results:\n- For $\\alpha \\le 0$, the series diverges.\n- For $0  \\alpha \\le 1$, the series diverges.\n- For $\\alpha  1$, the series converges.\n\nThe system is BIBO-stable if and only if $\\alpha  1$.

The condition $\\|h\\|_{1}  \\infty$ is necessary for BIBO stability.\n\nThird, we analyze the absolute integrability of the derived impulse response $h(t)$.

Thus, we can establish a lower bound for each term in the series:\n$$ \\int_{k\\pi}^{(k+1)\\pi} \\frac{|\\sin(u)|}{u}\\,du \\ge \\int_{k\\pi}^{(k+1)\\pi} \\frac{|\\sin(u)|}{(k+1)\\pi}\\,du = \\frac{1}{(k+1)\\pi}\\int_{k\\pi}^{(k+1)\\pi}|\\sin(u)|\\,du = \\frac{2}{(k+1)\\pi} $$\nThe total integral is therefore bounded below by the sum of these terms:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{|\\sin(u)|}{u}\\,du \\ge \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2}{(k+1)\\pi} = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{k+1} = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{j} $$\nThe series $\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{j}$ is the harmonic series, which is known to diverge to infinity. By the direct comparison test, since the integral is greater than or equal to a series that diverges to infinity, the integral itself must diverge. Therefore, the value of $S$ is infinite.\n$$ S = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\bigl|h(t)\\bigr|\\,dt = \\infty $$\nThis result implies that the ideal low-pass filter is not BIBO stable.\n\nFourth, we reconcile the time-domain instability with the frequency-domain properties of $H(\\omega)$. The time-domain analysis concluded the system is not BIBO stable because $h(t)$ is not in the space of absolutely integrable functions, $L^1(\\mathbb{R})$. In the frequency domain, the transfer function $H(\\omega)$ is uniformly bounded, with $|H(\\omega)| \\le 1$ for all $\\omega$. This means $H(\\omega)$ belongs to the space of essentially bounded functions, $L^\\infty(\\mathbb{R})$.\nThe apparent conflict is resolved by understanding that different stability definitions correspond to different function space norms.\n1.  **BIBO Stability**: This corresponds to the stability of a system as an operator from the space of bounded functions, $L^\\infty(\\mathbb{R})$, to itself. The condition for an LTI system's stability in this sense is that its impulse response $h(t)$ must be in $L^1(\\mathbb{R})$. Our analysis confirmed $h(t) \\notin L^1(\\mathbb{R})$. The theory of Fourier transforms states that if $h(t) \\in L^1(\\mathbb{R})$, then its transform $H(\\omega)$ must be a continuous function that vanishes at infinity. The given $H(\\omega)$ has jump discontinuities at $\\omega = \\pm\\Omega_{c}$, which is a definitive indicator that its inverse transform $h(t)$ cannot be in $L^1(\\mathbb{R})$.\n2.  **$L^2$ Stability**: This refers to the stability of a system as an operator from the space of finite-energy signals, $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$, to itself. An LTI system is $L^2$-stable if and only if its frequency response $H(\\omega)$ is in $L^\\infty(\\mathbb{R})$. Since $|H(\\omega)| \\le 1$, this condition is met. By Plancherel's theorem, we can relate the energy of the input and output: $\\|y\\|_{2}^{2} \\le \\|H\\|_{\\infty}^{2}\\|x\\|_{2}^{2}$, where $\\| \\cdot \\|_{2}$ is the $L^2$ norm. In this case, $\\|y\\|_{2}^{2} \\le \\|x\\|_{2}^{2}$, meaning the filter does not amplify signal energy. The energy of the impulse response itself is finite:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}|h(t)|^2\\,dt = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}|H(\\omega)|^2\\,d\\omega = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\Omega_{c}}^{\\Omega_{c}}1^2\\,d\\omega = \\frac{2\\Omega_{c}}{2\\pi} = \\frac{\\Omega_{c}}{\\pi}  \\infty $$\nThis confirms that $h(t) \\in L^2(\\mathbb{R})$.\n\nIn summary, the boundedness of $H(\\omega)$ implies $L^2$-stability, but not BIBO stability. The condition for BIBO stability is the more stringent requirement that $h(t)$ be absolutely integrable ($h(t) \\in L^1(\\mathbb{R})$), which is not satisfied by the ideal low-pass filter. The system is stable in the sense of energy but unstable in the sense of bounded amplitude.\n\nThe final answer required is the value of the integral $S$.
