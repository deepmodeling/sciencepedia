The integral thus becomes:\n$$y(t) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(\\alpha \\tau) \\exp(st - s\\tau) \\, d\\tau$$\nThe term $\\exp(st)$ is constant with respect to the integration variable $\\tau$ and can be factored out of the integral:\n$$y(t) = \\exp(st) \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(\\alpha \\tau) \\exp(-s\\tau) \\, d\\tau$$\n$$y(t) = \\exp(st) \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp((\\alpha - s)\\tau) \\, d\\tau$$\nThis improper integral converges in the classical sense if and only if the real part of the exponent in the integrand is strictly negative.

The integral evaluates to:\n$$\\frac{0}{\\alpha - s} - \\frac{1}{\\alpha - s} = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha - s} = \\frac{1}{s - \\alpha}$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $y(t)$, we obtain the output for the specified ROC:\n$$y(t) = \\exp(st) \\left( \\frac{1}{s - \\alpha} \\right) = \\frac{\\exp(st)}{s - \\alpha}, \\quad \\text{for } \\Re\\{s\\} > \\Re\\{\\alpha\\}$$\nThis demonstrates the eigenfunction property of complex exponentials for LTI systems: the output is the input scaled by a complex constant. This constant, which we denote as $H(s) = \\frac{1}{s-\\alpha}$, is the system's transfer function, which is the bilateral Laplace transform of the impulse response $h(t)$.\n\nThe expression $H(s) = \\frac{1}{s - \\alpha}$ was derived for the half-plane $\\Re\\{s\\} > \\Re\\{\\alpha\\}$. However, viewed as a function of the complex variable $s$, $H(s)$ is a meromorphic function defined on the entire complex plane $\\mathbb{C}$. Its only singularity is a simple pole at $s = \\alpha$.\n\nThe Principle of Analytic Continuation (or Identity Theorem) states that if two functions, analytic on a domain $D$, agree on an open subset of $D$, then they are identical throughout $D$. Our function defined by the integral $H_{int}(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp((\\alpha - s)\\tau) \\, d\\tau$ is analytic on the domain $D_1 = \\{ s \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid \\Re\\{s\\} > \\Re\\{\\alpha\\} \\}$. The function $H_{ac}(s) = \\frac{1}{s - \\alpha}$ is analytic on the domain $D_2 = \\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{\\alpha\\}$. Since $D_1 \\subset D_2$ and $H_{int}(s) = H_{ac}(s)$ for all $s \\in D_1$, $H_{ac}(s)$ is the unique analytic continuation of $H_{int}(s)$ to the larger domain $D_2$.\n\nBy invoking this principle, we extend the validity of the input-output relationship from the original ROC to the entire domain of analyticity of $H(s)$. The output $y(t)$ is therefore given by:\n$$y(t) = H(s) \\exp(st) = \\frac{\\exp(st)}{s - \\alpha}$$\nThis expression is now valid for all $s \\in \\mathbb{C}$ such that $s \\neq \\alpha$. The singularity at $s = \\alpha$ is a simple pole, which indicates that the system response is undefined (infinite) when driven at its natural frequency.\n\nThe boundary of the ROC is the line $\\Re\\{s\\} = \\Re\\{\\alpha\\}$. Let $s = \\sigma_0 + i\\omega_s$ and $\\alpha = \\sigma_0 + i\\omega_\\alpha$ where $\\sigma_0 = \\Re\\{s\\} = \\Re\\{\\alpha\\}$.\n\nFor the generic boundary case where $s \\neq \\alpha$, it must be that $\\omega_s \\neq \\omega_\\alpha$. The convolution integral's integrand becomes $\\exp((\\alpha-s)\\tau) = \\exp(i(\\omega_\\alpha - \\omega_s)\\tau)$. This is a pure sinusoid that does not decay as $\\tau \\to \\infty$, so the integral $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(i(\\omega_\\alpha - \\omega_s)\\tau) \\, d\\tau$ does not converge in the classical sense. However, the analytically continued expression for $y(t)$ remains well-defined:\n$$y(t) = \\frac{\\exp((\\sigma_0 + i\\omega_s)t)}{(\\sigma_0 + i\\omega_\\alpha) - (\\sigma_0 + i\\omega_s)} = \\frac{\\exp((\\sigma_0 + i\\omega_s)t)}{i(\\omega_\\alpha - \\omega_s)}$$\nThe output is a finite, oscillating signal, representing a steady-state response. This value is obtained by approaching the boundary from within the convergent region.\n\nFor the singular point $s = \\alpha$, we have $\\Re\\{s\\} = \\Re\\{\\alpha\\}$ and $\\Im\\{s\\} = \\Im\\{\\alpha\\}$. The convolution integral becomes:\n$$y(t) = \\exp(\\alpha t) \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp((\\alpha - \\alpha)\\tau) \\, d\\tau = \\exp(\\alpha t) \\int_{0}^{\\infty} 1 \\, d\\tau$$\nThis integral diverges to infinity. The classical convolution fails. This failure reflects physical resonance: the system is being driven by an eternal (bilateral) input $x(t) = \\exp(\\alpha t)$ that exactly matches its natural mode $h(t) = \\exp(\\alpha t)u(t)$. The system's state has been accumulating energy for all past time, leading to an infinite output at any finite time $t$. The pole in the analytically continued expression at $s=\\alpha$ correctly reflects this resonant divergence.\n\nIn contrast, if the input were the causal exponential $x_{causal}(t) = \\exp(\\alpha t) u(t)$, the convolution would be:\n$$y_{causal}(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} [\\exp(\\alpha\\tau)u(\\tau)] [\\exp(\\alpha(t-\\tau))u(t-\\tau)]\\,d\\tau$$\nThe product of the two Heaviside functions $u(\\tau)u(t-\\tau)$ is non-zero only for $0 \\leq \\tau \\leq t$ (assuming $t \\geq 0$). For $t  0$, the integral is zero. For $t \\geq 0$:\n$$y_{causal}(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\exp(\\alpha\\tau) \\exp(\\alpha(t-\\tau)) \\, d\\tau = \\exp(\\alpha t) \\int_{0}^{t} 1 \\, d\\tau = t \\exp(\\alpha t)$$\nThe complete result is $y_{causal}(t) = t \\exp(\\alpha t) u(t)$. Here, the convolution integral always converges for any finite $t$ because the integration is over a finite interval $[0, t]$. The output grows linearly with time, a characteristic of resonance with a causal input that starts at $t=0$. The divergence in the case of the bilateral input arises from integrating over an infinite past history, whereas the causal input problem integrates over a finite past, leading to a finite result.\n\nThe final required expression is the result of analytic continuation, valid for all $s \\neq \\alpha$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\exp(st)}{s - \\alpha}}$$", "id": "2867892"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice addresses a critical and subtle issue in both continuous and discrete-time systems: hidden instability.
