This specifies the sequence samples as $\\{1, 2, 1\\}$ for $n \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n-   **Impulse Response**: $h[n]$ is a finite-length sequence defined by $h[n]=1$ for $n \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ and $h[n]=0$ otherwise.

Any discrete-time signal $x[n]$ can be expressed as a superposition of shifted unit impulses: $x[n]=\\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} x[k]\\,\\delta[n-k]$, where $\\delta[n]$ is the Kronecker delta.\n    2.  For an LTI system, the response to a shifted impulse $\\delta[n-k]$ is the shifted impulse response $h[n-k]$.\n-   **Required Method**: The output $y[n]$ must be evaluated using the \"flip-and-slide\" graphical interpretation derived from the foundational principles. This involves explicitly forming the reversed kernel $h[-k]$ and sliding it across $x[k]$ to compute $y[n]$ as an inner product for each shift $n$.\n-   **Constraints**: No transform-domain methods or pre-memorized formulas (e.g., for the length of the convolved sequence) may be used. The derivation must rely solely on the provided principles.\n-   **Output Format**: Report the nonzero samples of $y[n]$ as a single row vector.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is found to be valid based on the following criteria:\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is a standard exercise in linear systems theory, based on the fundamental definition of discrete convolution. All principles provided are correct and central to the field of signal processing.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The input signal $x[n]$ and the impulse response $h[n]$ are unambiguously defined. The task is to compute their convolution, which is a well-defined mathematical operation with a unique result for the given finite-length sequences.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise mathematical language, free from subjectivity or ambiguity.\n-   **Completeness**: All necessary information to solve the problem is provided.\n-   **Consistency**: There are no contradictions in the problem statement. The constraints on the solution method are restrictive but consistent with a pedagogical goal of reinforcing first principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution will now be derived.\n\nThe output $y[n]$ of an LTI system with impulse response $h[n]$ to an input $x[n]$ is determined by applying the principles of linearity and time-invariance. First, the input signal is decomposed into a sum of scaled and shifted unit impulses, as given:\n$$x[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[k] \\delta[n-k]$$\nLet the system be represented by the operator $L\\{\\cdot\\}$. The output is $y[n] = L\\{x[n]\\}$. By the property of linearity, the operator can be distributed over the summation and the constant coefficients $x[k]$:\n$$y[n] = L\\left\\{\\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[k] \\delta[n-k]\\right\\} = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[k] L\\{\\delta[n-k]\\}$$\nThe response of the system to a unit impulse $\\delta[n]$ is the impulse response $h[n] = L\\{\\delta[n]\\}$. By the property of time-invariance, the response to a time-shifted impulse $\\delta[n-k]$ is a similarly time-shifted impulse response, $h[n-k] = L\\{\\delta[n-k]\\}$. Substituting this into the expression for $y[n]$ yields the discrete convolution sum:\n$$y[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[k] h[n-k]$$\nThis formula prescribes the method for computing the output sample at each time index $n$. It is an inner product over the index $k$ of the input signal $x[k]$ and the time-reversed, shifted impulse response $h[n-k]$. This is the basis of the \"flip-and-slide\" evaluation method.\n\nThe specific signals are given:\n-   The input signal $x[k]$ has non-zero values $x[0]=1$, $x[1]=2$, and $x[2]=1$. The support of $x[k]$ is the set of indices $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n-   The impulse response $h[k]$ has non-zero values $h[0]=1$ and $h[1]=1$. The support of $h[k]$ is the set of indices $\\{0, 1\\}$.\n\nWe evaluate $y[n]$ for each integer value of $n$ by performing the following steps:\n1.  **Flip**: The impulse response $h[k]$ is time-reversed to obtain $h[-k]$. The sample $h[0]=1$ remains at index $k=0$, and the sample $h[1]=1$ moves to index $k=-1$. So, the support of $h[-k]$ is the set of indices $\\{-1, 0\\}$.\n2.  **Slide**: The flipped sequence $h[-k]$ is shifted by $n$ to obtain $h[n-k]$. A shift by $n$ moves the support of $h[-k]$ (which is $\\{-1, 0\\}$) to the set $\\{n-1, n\\}$. This is the support of $h[n-k]$ for the summation over $k$.\n3.  **Multiply and Sum**: For each $n$, the product $x[k]h[n-k]$ is formed and summed over all $k$. The sum will be non-zero only if the supports of $x[k]$ and $h[n-k]$ have a non-empty intersection. The support of $x[k]$ is $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$, and the support of $h[n-k]$ is $\\{n-1, n\\}$. Overlap exists only for values of $n$ where $\\{0, 1, 2\\} \\cap \\{n-1, n\\} \\neq \\emptyset$. This condition holds for $n$ from $0$ to $3$. For all other $n$, the output $y[n]$ is zero. We now compute the non-zero values.\n\n-   **For $n=0$**:\n    The support of $h[0-k] = h[-k]$ is $\\{-1, 0\\}$. The intersection with the support of $x[k]$ is $\\{0\\}$.\n    $$y[0] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[k] h[-k] = \\dots + x[-1]h[1] + x[0]h[0] + x[1]h[-1] + \\dots$$\n    The only non-zero term in the sum is for $k=0$.\n    $$y[0] = x[0]h[0] = (1)(1) = 1$$\n\n-   **For $n=1$**:\n    The support of $h[1-k]$ is $\\{0, 1\\}$. The intersection with the support of $x[k]$ is $\\{0, 1\\}$.\n    $$y[1] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[k] h[1-k] = x[0]h[1] + x[1]h[0]$$\n    $$y[1] = (1)(1) + (2)(1) = 1 + 2 = 3$$\n\n-   **For $n=2$**:\n    The support of $h[2-k]$ is $\\{1, 2\\}$. The intersection with the support of $x[k]$ is $\\{1, 2\\}$.\n    $$y[2] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[k] h[2-k] = x[1]h[1] + x[2]h[0]$$\n    $$y[2] = (2)(1) + (1)(1) = 2 + 1 = 3$$\n\n-   **For $n=3$**:\n    The support of $h[3-k]$ is $\\{2, 3\\}$. The intersection with the support of $x[k]$ is $\\{2\\}$.\n    $$y[3] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[k] h[3-k] = x[2]h[1]$$\n    $$y[3] = (1)(1) = 1$$\n\n-   **For $n \\ge 4$**:\n    The support of $h[n-k]$ is $\\{n-1, n\\}$. Since $n \\ge 4$, $n-1 \\ge 3$. The intersection with the support of $x[k]$, which is $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$, is empty. Therefore, $y[n] = 0$ for all $n \\ge 4$.\n\n-   **For $n  0$**:\n    The support of $h[n-k]$ is $\\{n-1, n\\}$. Since $n  0$, both $n-1$ and $n$ are less than $0$. The intersection with the support of $x[k]$ is empty. Therefore, $y[n] = 0$ for all $n  0$.\n\nThe resulting output sequence $y[n]$ has non-zero samples for $n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.

We calculate the values directly:\n$y_{\\text{lin}}[0] = \\sum_{k} x[k]h[0-k] = x[0]h[0] = (2)(1) = 2$.\n$y_{\\text{lin}}[1] = \\sum_{k} x[k]h[1-k] = x[0]h[1] + x[1]h[0] = (2)(2) + (-1)(1) = 4-1 = 3$.\n$y_{\\text{lin}}[2] = \\sum_{k} x[k]h[2-k] = x[0]h[2] + x[1]h[1] + x[2]h[0] = (2)(-2) + (-1)(2) + (3)(1) = -4-2+3 = -3$.\n$y_{\\text{lin}}[3] = \\sum_{k} x[k]h[3-k] = x[1]h[2] + x[2]h[1] + x[3]h[0] = (-1)(-2) + (3)(2) + (0)(1) = 2+6 = 8$.\n$y_{\\text{lin}}[4] = \\sum_{k} x[k]h[4-k] = x[2]h[2] + x[3]h[1] + x[4]h[0] = (3)(-2) + (0)(2) + (1)(1) = -6+1 = -5$.\n$y_{\\text{lin}}[5] = \\sum_{k} x[k]h[5-k] = x[3]h[2] + x[4]h[1] = (0)(-2) + (1)(2) = 2$.\n$y_{\\text{lin}}[6] = \\sum_{k} x[k]h[6-k] = x[4]h[2] = (1)(-2) = -2$.\nFor $n  6$, the result is $0$.\nThe linear convolution sequence is $y_{\\text{lin}}[n] = \\{2, 3, -3, 8, -5, 2, -2\\}$ for $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 6\\}$.\n\nFor Task 2, we compute the $N=5$ point circular convolution, $y_{\\text{circ},5}[n]$. First, we define the length-$5$ sequences. The sequence $x[n]$ is already of length $5$, so we denote it $x_5[n] = x[n]$. The sequence $h[n]$ must be zero-padded to length $5$: $h_5[n] = \\{1, 2, -2, 0, 0\\}$.\nThe definition of $N$-point circular convolution is\n$$\ny_{\\text{circ},N}[n] = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} x_{N}[k] h_{N}[(n-k) \\pmod N].\n$$\nFor $N=5$, we compute $y_{\\text{circ},5}[n]$ for $n \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$:\n$y_{\\text{circ},5}[0] = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} x_5[k]h_5[(-k) \\pmod 5] = x_5[0]h_5[0] + x_5[1]h_5[4] + x_5[2]h_5[3] + x_5[3]h_5[2] + x_5[4]h_5[1] = (2)(1) + (-1)(0) + (3)(0) + (0)(-2) + (1)(2) = 2+2=4$.\n$y_{\\text{circ},5}[1] = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} x_5[k]h_5[(1-k) \\pmod 5] = x_5[0]h_5[1] + x_5[1]h_5[0] + x_5[2]h_5[4] + x_5[3]h_5[3] + x_5[4]h_5[2] = (2)(2) + (-1)(1) + (3)(0) + (0)(0) + (1)(-2) = 4-1-2=1$.\n$y_{\\text{circ},5}[2] = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} x_5[k]h_5[(2-k) \\pmod 5] = x_5[0]h_5[2] + x_5[1]h_5[1] + x_5[2]h_5[0] + x_5[3]h_5[4] + x_5[4]h_5[3] = (2)(-2) + (-1)(2) + (3)(1) + (0)(0) + (1)(0) = -4-2+3=-3$.\n$y_{\\text{circ},5}[3] = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} x_5[k]h_5[(3-k) \\pmod 5] = x_5[0]h_5[3] + x_5[1]h_5[2] + x_5[2]h_5[1] + x_5[3]h_5[0] + x_5[4]h_5[4] = (2)(0) + (-1)(-2) + (3)(2) + (0)(1) + (1)(0) = 2+6=8$.\n$y_{\\text{circ},5}[4] = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} x_5[k]h_5[(4-k) \\pmod 5] = x_5[0]h_5[4] + x_5[1]h_5[3] + x_5[2]h_5[2] + x_5[3]h_5[1] + x_5[4]h_5[0] = (2)(0) + (-1)(0) + (3)(-2) + (0)(2) + (1)(1) = -6+1=-5$.\nThe circular convolution sequence is $y_{\\text{circ},5}[n] = \\{4, 1, -3, 8, -5\\}$ for $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 4\\}$.\n\nThe discrepancy between $y_{\\text{circ},5}[n]$ and $y_{\\text{lin}}[n]$ arises from time-domain aliasing. The length of the linear convolution is $N_y=7$, which is greater than the length of the circular convolution, $N=5$. The circular convolution is equivalent to summing the time-aliased version of the linear convolution result: $y_{\\text{circ},N}[n] = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} y_{\\text{lin}}[n+mN]$.\nFor $N=5$:\n$y_{\\text{circ},5}[0] = y_{\\text{lin}}[0] + y_{\\text{lin}}[5] + \\dots = 2 + 2 = 4$. This does not equal $y_{\\text{lin}}[0]=2$. The wrap-around occurs because the term $y_{\\text{lin}}[5]$ (where index $5 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 5$) is aliased to index $n=0$.\n$y_{\\text{circ},5}[1] = y_{\\text{lin}}[1] + y_{\\text{lin}}[6] + \\dots = 3 + (-2) = 1$. This does not equal $y_{\\text{lin}}[1]=3$. The wrap-around occurs because the term $y_{\\text{lin}}[6]$ (where index $6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5$) is aliased to index $n=1$.\nFor $n \\in \\{2,3,4\\}$, there are no higher-order terms from $y_{\\text{lin}}$ to alias, as its support ends at $n=6$. Thus, for these indices:\n$y_{\\text{circ},5}[2] = y_{\\text{lin}}[2] = -3$.\n$y_{\\text{circ},5}[3] = y_{\\text{lin}}[3] = 8$.\n$y_{\\text{circ},5}[4] = y_{\\text{lin}}[4] = -5$.\nThe wrap-around contaminates the first two samples of the circular convolution result because $N  N_x+N_h-1$.\n\nFor Task 3, we compute the squared discrepancy $S$.\n$$\nS \\triangleq \\sum_{n=0}^{4} \\big( y_{\\text{circ},5}[n]-y_{\\text{lin}}[n] \\big)^{2}.\n$$\nUsing the results from the previous tasks:\n$S = (y_{\\text{circ},5}[0]-y_{\\text{lin}}[0])^2 + (y_{\\text{circ},5}[1]-y_{\\text{lin}}[1])^2 + (y_{\\text{circ},5}[2]-y_{\\text{lin}}[2])^2 + (y_{\\text{circ},5}[3]-y_{\\text{lin}}[3])^2 + (y_{\\text{circ},5}[4]-y_{\\text{lin}}[4])^2$\n$S = (4-2)^2 + (1-3)^2 + (-3 - (-3))^2 + (8-8)^2 + (-5 - (-5))^2$\n$S = (2)^2 + (-2)^2 + (0)^2 + (0)^2 + (0)^2$\n$S = 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 8$.\n\nFor Task 4, we demonstrate why zero-padding to $N \\geq N_{x}+N_{h}-1$ ensures $y_{\\text{circ},N}[n]=y_{\\text{lin}}[n]$ for $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N_x+N_h-2\\}$.\nLet $N_y = N_x+N_h-1$. The condition is $N \\ge N_y$. We consider the circular convolution sum for $n \\in \\{0, \\dots, N_y-1\\}$:\n$$\ny_{\\text{circ},N}[n] = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} x_N[k] h_N[(n-k) \\pmod N].\n$$\nSince $x[n]$ has support of length $N_x$, the zero-padded sequence $x_N[k]$ is non-zero only for $k \\in \\{0,\\dots,N_x-1\\}$. The sum reduces to:\n$$\ny_{\\text{circ},N}[n] = \\sum_{k=0}^{N_x-1} x[k] h_N[(n-k) \\pmod N].\n$$\nLet us analyze the index $j = n-k$. Since $n \\in \\{0, \\dots, N_y-1\\}$ and $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, N_x-1\\}$, the range of $j$ is:\n$j_{max} = (N_y-1) - 0 = N_y-1 = N_x+N_h-2$.\n$j_{min} = 0 - (N_x-1) = 1-N_x$.\nSo, $1-N_x \\le j \\le N_x+N_h-2$.\nThe condition $N \\ge N_x+N_h-1$ implies $N  j_{max}$ and $N-(N_x-1) \\ge N_h$.\nWe analyze the term $h_N[(n-k) \\pmod N]$ based on the sign of $j=n-k$:\nCase 1: $j \\ge 0$. Here, $0 \\le n-k \\le N_x+N_h-2$. Since $N \\ge N_x+N_h-1$, we have $n-k  N$. Thus, $(n-k) \\pmod N = n-k$. The term becomes $h_N[n-k]$. By definition of zero-padding, $h_N[m] = h[m]$ for $m \\in \\{0, \\dots, N_h-1\\}$ and $h_N[m]=0$ for $m \\ge N_h$. This is identical to $h[n-k]$ used in linear convolution, as $h[n-k]$ is also zero for $n-k \\ge N_h$.\nCase 2: $j  0$. Here, $1-N_x \\le n-k \\le -1$. The term becomes $(n-k) \\pmod N = n-k+N$. The range for this index is $N-(N_x-1) \\le n-k+N \\le N-1$. With our condition $N \\ge N_x+N_h-1$, we have $N-N_x+1 \\ge N_h$. So, the index $n-k+N$ is always greater than or equal to $N_h$. For any index $m \\ge N_h$, $h_N[m]$ is zero. Therefore, for all $k$ where $n-k0$, the term $h_N[(n-k) \\pmod N]$ is zero. This matches linear convolution, where $h[n-k]$ is zero for $n-k0$.\nIn both cases, for all $k$ in the sum, $h_N[(n-k) \\pmod N] = h[n-k]$. Consequently,\n$$\ny_{\\text{circ},N}[n] = \\sum_{k=0}^{N_x-1} x[k] h[n-k] = y_{\\text{lin}}[n]\n$$\nfor all $n \\in \\{0, \\dots, N_x+N_h-2\\}$. The condition $N \\ge N_x+N_h-1$ guarantees that the convolution length $N$ is sufficient to hold the entire linear convolution result without any part of the sequence wrapping around due to the modulo operation.\n\nWe verify this for $N=7=N_x+N_h-1$. The zero-padded sequences are $x_7[n]=\\{2, -1, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0\\}$ and $h_7[n]=\\{1, 2, -2, 0, 0, 0, 0\\}$. Let us check for a nontrivial index $n=3$:\n$$\ny_{\\text{circ},7}[3] = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} x_7[k] h_7[(3-k) \\pmod 7]\n$$\nThe only non-zero terms are:\n$k=1: x_7[1]h_7[2] = (-1)(-2) = 2$.\n$k=2: x_7[2]h_7[1] = (3)(2) = 6$.\nThe sum is $y_{\\text{circ},7}[3] = 2+6 = 8$. This matches $y_{\\text{lin}}[3]=8$, as expected. The demonstration confirms that sufficient zero-padding prevents time-domain aliasing.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{8}\n$$", "id": "2862224"}]}
