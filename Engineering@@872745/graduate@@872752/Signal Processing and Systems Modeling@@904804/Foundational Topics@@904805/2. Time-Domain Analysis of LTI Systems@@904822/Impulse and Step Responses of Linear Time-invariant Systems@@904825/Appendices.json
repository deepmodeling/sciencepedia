It is well-posed, with sufficient information provided for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The premise of asymptotic stability is verifiable: the poles of $H_{0}(s)$ are the roots of the denominator $s^{2}+6s+8=0$, which factors as $(s+2)(s+4)=0$. The poles are at $s=-2$ and $s=-4$. Since both poles lie in the open left-half of the complex plane, the system is indeed asymptotically stable. The problem is free of contradictions, ambiguities, or pseudo-scientific claims.\n\nVerdict: The problem is valid. A solution will be constructed.\n\nThe first objective is to determine the constant $\\alpha$. The input to the system is a unit-step function, denoted $u(t)$, whose Laplace transform is $U(s) = \\frac{1}{s}$. The transfer function of the scaled system is $H(s) = \\alpha H_{0}(s)$. The output of this system, $Y(s)$, is the product of the transfer function and the input transform:\n$$Y(s) = H(s)U(s) = \\alpha H_{0}(s) \\frac{1}{s} = \\alpha \\frac{4(s+1)}{s(s^2+6s+8)}$$\nThe steady-state value of the output, $y_{ss} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y(t)$, can be determined using the Final Value Theorem (FVT) of the Laplace transform. The FVT states that if all poles of $sY(s)$ are in the strict left-half of the complex plane, then $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y(t) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} sY(s)$.\nThe function $sY(s)$ is given by:\n$$sY(s) = \\alpha \\frac{4(s+1)}{s^2+6s+8}$$\nThe poles of $sY(s)$ are the roots of $s^2+6s+8=0$, which are $s=-2$ and $s=-4$. Both poles are in the left-half plane, so the FVT is applicable.\nApplying the theorem:\n$$y_{ss} = \\lim_{s \\to 0} sY(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\alpha \\frac{4(s+1)}{s^2+6s+8}$$\nSubstituting $s=0$ into the expression:\n$$y_{ss} = \\alpha \\frac{4(0+1)}{0^2+6(0)+8} = \\alpha \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}$$\nThe problem requires this steady-state value to be equal to $1$.\n$$y_{ss} = 1 \\implies \\frac{\\alpha}{2} = 1$$\nSolving for $\\alpha$ yields $\\alpha=2$. This value satisfies the condition $\\alpha0$.\n\nThe second objective is to find the residues $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ for the partial fraction expansion of the normalized transfer function $H(s)$.

Poles and zeros at the origin $z=0$ do not affect this classification.\nFor $H_{\\min}(z) = 1$, there are no poles or zeros other than potentially at the origin or infinity, depending on the interpretation. For a causal finite impulse response (FIR) filter like this, stability is guaranteed and it is conventionally considered minimum-phase as it has no zeros outside the unit circle.\n\nFor $H_{\\text{nm}}(z)$, the pole is determined by the root of the denominator polynomial, $1 - c z^{-1} = 0$, which gives $z=c$. Since $0  c  1$, the pole is strictly inside the unit circle, $|c|1$, which confirms the stability of the causal system. The zero is determined by the root of the numerator polynomial, $z^{-1} - c = 0$, which gives $z = 1/c$. Since $0  c  1$, the zero is strictly outside the unit circle, $|1/c|  1$. The presence of a zero outside the unit circle makes $H_{\\text{nm}}(z)$ a nonminimum-phase system.\n\nNext, we demonstrate that the magnitude responses are identical. The frequency response is obtained by evaluating the transfer function on the unit circle, $z = \\exp(j\\omega)$.\nFor the minimum-phase system:\n$$|H_{\\min}(\\exp(j\\omega))| = |1| = 1$$\nFor the nonminimum-phase system:\n$$H_{\\text{nm}}(\\exp(j\\omega)) = \\frac{\\exp(-j\\omega) - c}{1 - c \\exp(-j\\omega)}$$\nTo find the magnitude, we compute $|H_{\\text{nm}}(\\exp(j\\omega))|$. A direct method is to recognize that the denominator is related to the complex conjugate of the numerator. Let $w = \\exp(-j\\omega) - c$. Since $c$ is real, its complex conjugate is $\\bar{c}=c$, and the conjugate of $\\exp(-j\\omega)$ is $\\exp(j\\omega)$. The denominator is $1 - c \\exp(-j\\omega) = \\exp(-j\\omega)(\\exp(j\\omega) - c) = \\exp(-j\\omega)\\bar{w}$.\nTherefore,\n$$|H_{\\text{nm}}(\\exp(j\\omega))| = \\left| \\frac{w}{\\exp(-j\\omega)\\bar{w}} \\right| = \\frac{|w|}{|\\exp(-j\\omega)| |\\bar{w}|}$$\nSince $|\\exp(-j\\omega)| = 1$ and $|w|=|\\bar{w}|$, we have:\n$$|H_{\\text{nm}}(\\exp(j\\omega))| = 1$$\nThis confirms that both systems have identical, unity magnitude responses for all real frequencies $\\omega$. Systems with this property are known as all-pass filters.\n\nSecond, we address Task 2 by deriving the difference equations and the unit-step responses.\nFor the minimum-phase system, the input-output relationship in the $z$-domain is $Y_{\\min}(z) = H_{\\min}(z) X(z) = 1 \\cdot X(z) = X(z)$. Applying the inverse $z$-transform yields the difference equation:\n$$y_{\\min}[n] = x[n]$$\nThe input is the unit-step sequence $x[n] = u[n]$, defined as $u[n]=1$ for $n \\ge 0$ and $u[n]=0$ for $n  0$. The corresponding step response is:\n$$y_{\\min}[n] = u[n]$$\nThe steady-state value as $n \\to \\infty$ is $y_{\\min}[\\infty] = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} u[n] = 1$.\n\nFor the nonminimum-phase system, the input-output relationship is $Y_{\\text{nm}}(z) = H_{\\text{nm}}(z) X(z)$.\n$$Y_{\\text{nm}}(z) = \\left( \\frac{z^{-1} - c}{1 - c z^{-1}} \\right) X(z)$$\nCross-multiplying gives $Y_{\\text{nm}}(z)(1 - c z^{-1}) = X(z)(z^{-1} - c)$, which expands to $Y_{\\text{nm}}(z) - c z^{-1}Y_{\\text{nm}}(z) = z^{-1}X(z) - cX(z)$. Applying the inverse $z$-transform and using the time-shift property $\\mathcal{Z}^{-1}\\{z^{-k}F(z)\\} = f[n-k]$, we obtain the causal difference equation:\n$$y_{\\text{nm}}[n] - c y_{\\text{nm}}[n-1] = x[n-1] - c x[n]$$\n$$y_{\\text{nm}}[n] = c y_{\\text{nm}}[n-1] + x[n-1] - c x[n]$$\nTo find the unit-step response, we set $x[n] = u[n]$. The $z$-transform of the input is $X(z) = \\mathcal{Z}\\{u[n]\\} = \\frac{1}{1-z^{-1}}$. The output transform is:\n$$Y_{\\text{nm}}(z) = \\left( \\frac{z^{-1} - c}{1 - c z^{-1}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - z^{-1}} \\right)$$\nWe use partial fraction expansion to find the inverse transform. Let\n$$Y_{\\text{nm}}(z) = \\frac{A}{1 - c z^{-1}} + \\frac{B}{1 - z^{-1}}$$\nThe coefficient $A$ is found by:\n$$A = \\left. (1 - c z^{-1}) Y_{\\text{nm}}(z) \\right|_{z^{-1}=1/c} = \\left. \\frac{z^{-1} - c}{1 - z^{-1}} \\right|_{z^{-1}=1/c} = \\frac{1/c - c}{1 - 1/c} = \\frac{(1-c^2)/c}{(c-1)/c} = \\frac{-(c-1)(c+1)}{c-1} = -(1+c)$$\nThe coefficient $B$ is found by:\n$$B = \\left.

The undershoot magnitude $\\Delta(c)$ is defined as:\n$$\\Delta(c) = \\max_{n \\ge 0} \\big( y_{\\min}[\\infty] - y_{\\text{nm}}[n] \\big)$$\nWe have already found $y_{\\min}[\\infty] = 1$. Substituting the expressions for $y_{\\min}[\\infty]$ and $y_{\\text{nm}}[n]$ for $n \\ge 0$:\n$$y_{\\min}[\\infty] - y_{\\text{nm}}[n] = 1 - \\left(1 - (1+c)c^n\\right) = (1+c)c^n$$\nWe must find the maximum value of the sequence $D[n] = (1+c)c^n$ for integers $n \\ge 0$.\nThe parameter $c$ lies in the interval $0  c  1$. Consequently, the factor $(1+c)$ is a positive constant greater than $1$. The term $c^n$ is a geometric sequence. Since $0  c  1$, this sequence is positive and strictly monotonically decreasing for $n \\ge 0$.\nSpecifically, $c^0=1$, $c^1=c$, $c^2  c$, and so on. The maximum value of $c^n$ for $n \\ge 0$ occurs at the smallest value of $n$, which is $n=0$.\nTherefore, the maximum of the sequence $D[n]$ also occurs at $n=0$:\n$$\\Delta(c) = \\max_{n \\ge 0} \\left((1+c)c^n\\right) = (1+c)c^0 = 1+c$$\nThis result represents the maximum deviation of the nonminimum-phase response from the final steady-state value, which occurs at time $n=0$ where the response is $y_{\\text{nm}}[0] = 1 - (1+c) = -c$.

So, $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\times (\\text{a term approaching } 0) = 0$.\n\nCombining these results, we find the exponential growth rate:\n$$\n\\gamma = 0 + \\ln(r) + 0 = \\ln(r)\n$$\nThe growth rate is the natural logarithm of the magnitude of the unstable pole, demonstrating that the asymptotic behavior is entirely dictated by the unstable part of the system dynamics. The expression does not depend on $p$, because the stable pole's contribution decays to zero.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\ln(r)}\n$$", "id": "2877018"}]}
