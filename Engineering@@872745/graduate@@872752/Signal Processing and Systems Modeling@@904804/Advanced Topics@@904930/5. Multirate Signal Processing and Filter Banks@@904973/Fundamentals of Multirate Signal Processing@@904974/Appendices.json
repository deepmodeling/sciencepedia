This first exercise demystifies the process of interpolation by having you trace a simple cosine signal through an upsampler and a linear interpolator.

The signal is upsampled by an integer factor $L \\geq 2$ by inserting $L-1$ zeros between consecutive samples, producing $u[n]$, and then filtered by a zero-phase Finite Impulse Response (FIR) interpolator $h[n]$ that implements linear interpolation.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of digital signal processing, well-posed with a unique and stable solution, and formulated objectively using precise mathematical language. All necessary information is provided, and there are no internal contradictions. We may therefore proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the output signal $y[n]$ resulting from the upsampling and filtering of an input signal $x[n] = \\cos(\\omega_{0} n)$. The derivation will be conducted in the frequency domain, leveraging the Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) as stipulated. The process is as follows: first, we find a representation for the upsampled signal $u[n]$ as a sum of discrete-time sinusoids. Second, we determine the frequency response of the linear interpolator $h[n]$. Finally, we combine these results using the property that a sinusoidal signal passing through a Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system is scaled and phase-shifted according to the system's frequency response at the sinusoid's frequency.\n\nLet the input signal be $x[n] = \\cos(\\omega_{0} n)$, with $0  \\omega_0  \\pi$. Upsampling by a factor of $L$ involves inserting $L-1$ zeros between consecutive samples of $x[n]$. The resulting signal, $u[n]$, is defined as:\n$$\nu[n] =\n\\begin{cases}\nx[n/L] = \\cos(\\omega_{0} n/L),  \\text{if } n \\text{ is a multiple of } L, \\\\\n0,  \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis signal can be expressed more compactly using an impulse train. The function $\\frac{1}{L}\\sum_{k=0}^{L-1} e^{j(2\\pi k/L)n}$ evaluates to $1$ if $n$ is a multiple of $L$ and $0$ otherwise. Therefore, we can write $u[n]$ as the product:\n$$\nu[n] = \\cos(\\omega_{0}n/L) \\left( \\frac{1}{L} \\sum_{k=0}^{L-1} e^{j \\frac{2\\pi k}{L} n} \\right)\n$$\nUsing Euler's identity, $\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}(e^{j\\theta} + e^{-j\\theta})$, we expand this expression:\n$$\nu[n] = \\frac{1}{2L} \\left( e^{j\\frac{\\omega_{0}}{L}n} + e^{-j\\frac{\\omega_{0}}{L}n} \\right) \\sum_{k=0}^{L-1} e^{j \\frac{2\\pi k}{L} n} = \\frac{1}{2L} \\sum_{k=0}^{L-1} \\left( e^{j\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{0}+2\\pi k}{L}\\right)n} + e^{j\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k-\\omega_{0}}{L}\\right)n} \\right)\n$$\nWe can rearrange the second term in the summation by letting $m = L-k$ for $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, L-1\\}$. The complex exponential becomes $e^{j\\left(\\frac{2\\pi(L-m)-\\omega_{0}}{L}\\right)n} = e^{j\\left(2\\pi - \\frac{\\omega_{0}+2\\pi m}{L}\\right)n} = e^{-j\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{0}+2\\pi m}{L}\\right)n}$. The sum over $k$ from $0$ to $L-1$ is equivalent to a sum over $m$ from $0$ to $L-1$. Thus, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\nu[n] = \\frac{1}{L} \\sum_{k=0}^{L-1} \\frac{1}{2} \\left( e^{j\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{0}+2\\pi k}{L}\\right)n} + e^{-j\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{0}+2\\pi k}{L}\\right)n} \\right) = \\frac{1}{L} \\sum_{k=0}^{L-1} \\cos\\left( \\left(\\frac{\\omega_{0}+2\\pi k}{L}\\right) n \\right)\n$$\nThis shows that the upsampled signal $u[n]$ is a superposition of $L$ cosines. The frequencies generated by the upsampling operation are explicitly identified as:\n$$\n\\Omega_k = \\frac{\\omega_{0}+2\\pi k}{L}, \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, L-1\\}\n$$\nNext, we determine the frequency response $H(e^{j\\omega})$ of the FIR interpolator $h[n]$. The impulse response is a triangular pulse defined as $h[n] = 1 - \\frac{|n|}{L}$ for $|n|L$. This can be written as $h[n] = \\frac{1}{L}(L-|n|)$. It is a known result that a discrete-time triangular pulse of the form $L-|n|$ for $|n|L$ is the convolution of two rectangular pulses of length $L$. Let $r[n] = 1$ for $n \\in \\{0, \\dots, L-1\\}$ and $0$ otherwise. The convolution $(r*r[-n])[n]$ is precisely $L-|n|$ for $|n|L$.\nThe DTFT of $r[n]$ is $R(e^{j\\omega}) = \\sum_{n=0}^{L-1} e^{-j\\omega n} = e^{-j\\omega(L-1)/2} \\frac{\\sin(\\omega L/2)}{\\sin(\\omega/2)}$.\nThe DTFT of $r[-n]$ is $R(e^{-j\\omega}) = R^*(e^{j\\omega})$ since $r[n]$ is real.\nBy the convolution property of the DTFT, the transform of $(r*r[-n])[n]$ is $R(e^{j\\omega})R^*(e^{j\\omega}) = |R(e^{j\\omega})|^2$.\n$$\n\\text{DTFT}\\{L-|n|\\} = \\left| e^{-j\\omega(L-1)/2} \\frac{\\sin(\\omega L/2)}{\\sin(\\omega/2)} \\right|^2 = \\left( \\frac{\\sin(\\omega L/2)}{\\sin(\\omega/2)} \\right)^2\n$$\nSince $h[n] = \\frac{1}{L}(L-|n|)$, its frequency response is:\n$$\nH(e^{j\\omega}) = \\frac{1}{L} \\left( \\frac{\\sin(\\omega L/2)}{\\sin(\\omega/2)} \\right)^2\n$$\nThe output signal $y[n]$ is the convolution $y[n] = (h*u)[n]$. Due to the linearity of convolution, we have:\n$$\ny[n] = h[n] * \\left( \\frac{1}{L} \\sum_{k=0}^{L-1} \\cos(\\Omega_k n) \\right) = \\frac{1}{L} \\sum_{k=0}^{L-1} (h * \\cos(\\Omega_k n))[n]\n$$\nThe response of an LTI system with impulse response $h[n]$ to a sinusoidal input $\\cos(\\Omega_k n)$ is given by $|H(e^{j\\Omega_k})|\\cos(\\Omega_k n + \\angle H(e^{j\\Omega_k}))$. The filter $h[n]$ is real and even, so its DTFT, $H(e^{j\\omega})$, is real and even. Thus, the phase $\\angle H(e^{j\\Omega_k})$ is always $0$ or $\\pi$. Since $H(e^{j\\omega})$ is a squared quantity, it is non-negative, so the phase is $0$. The response to $\\cos(\\Omega_k n)$ is simply $H(e^{j\\Omega_k}) \\cos(\\Omega_k n)$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $y[n]$:\n$$\ny[n] = \\frac{1}{L} \\sum_{k=0}^{L-1} H(e^{j\\Omega_k}) \\cos(\\Omega_k n)\n$$\nWe now evaluate $H(e^{j\\Omega_k})$ by substituting $\\omega = \\Omega_k = \\frac{\\omega_{0}+2\\pi k}{L}$:\n$$\nH(e^{j\\Omega_k}) = \\frac{1}{L} \\left( \\frac{\\sin(\\Omega_k L/2)}{\\sin(\\Omega_k/2)} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{L} \\left( \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{(\\omega_{0}+2\\pi k)}{L} \\frac{L}{2}\\right)}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{0}+2\\pi k}{2L}\\right)} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{L} \\left( \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{0}}{2} + k\\pi\\right)}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{0}+2\\pi k}{2L}\\right)} \\right)^2\n$$\nSince $\\sin(\\theta + k\\pi) = (-1)^k \\sin(\\theta)$, the numerator term becomes $(\\sin(\\frac{\\omega_{0}}{2} + k\\pi))^2 = ((-1)^k \\sin(\\frac{\\omega_{0}}{2}))^2 = \\sin^2(\\frac{\\omega_{0}}{2})$.\nTherefore, the filter gain at each frequency $\\Omega_k$ is:\n$$\nH(e^{j\\Omega_k}) = \\frac{1}{L} \\frac{\\sin^2(\\omega_{0}/2)}{\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{0}+2\\pi k}{2L}\\right)}\n$$\nThe amplitudes of the cosine components in the output signal $y[n]$ are given by $\\frac{1}{L}H(e^{j\\Omega_k})$. These are:\n$$\nA_k = \\frac{1}{L^2} \\frac{\\sin^2(\\omega_{0}/2)}{\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{0}+2\\pi k}{2L}\\right)}\n$$\nFinally, the complete closed-form expression for the output signal $y[n]$ is obtained by substituting the amplitudes back into the sum:\n$$\ny[n] = \\sum_{k=0}^{L-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{L^2} \\frac{\\sin^2(\\omega_{0}/2)}{\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{0}+2\\pi k}{2L}\\right)} \\right) \\cos\\left( \\left(\\frac{\\omega_{0}+2\\pi k}{L}\\right) n \\right)\n$$\nThis expression represents the output as a real superposition of $L$ cosines, with explicitly identified frequencies $\\Omega_k$ and their corresponding amplitudes $A_k$, as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{y[n] = \\sum_{k=0}^{L-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{L^2} \\frac{\\sin^2(\\omega_{0}/2)}{\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{0}+2\\pi k}{2L}\\right)} \\right) \\cos\\left( \\left(\\frac{\\omega_{0}+2\\pi k}{L}\\right) n \\right)}$$", "id": "2874155"}, {"introduction": "While the previous exercise examined interpolation for a specific deterministic signal, this practice explores the fundamental limits of its counterpart: decimation.

A rigorous solution can be derived from first principles as requested.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe fundamental relationship between the PSD of a WSS process $x[n]$ and its decimated version $y[n]=x[nM]$ is given by:\n$$S_y(\\exp(j\\omega')) = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} S_x\\left(\\exp\\left(j\\frac{\\omega' - 2\\pi k}{M}\\right)\\right)$$\nwhere $\\omega'$ is the frequency variable for the decimated signal, defined on $[-\\pi, \\pi]$. An equivalent formulation using a positive sign in the sum is equally valid as $k$ covers all residues modulo $M$.\n\n**Part 1: Aliasing-Induced Center Frequency**\n\nDecimation in the time domain by a factor $M$ corresponds to a scaling of the frequency axis by a factor of $M$ in the frequency domain, followed by aliasing. A frequency component at $\\omega$ in the original signal $x[n]$ is mapped to the frequency $\\omega' = M\\omega$ in the decimated signal, which is then interpreted modulo $2\\pi$ to lie in $[-\\pi, \\pi]$.\n\nThe input spectrum $S_x(\\exp(j\\omega))$ has two non-zero bands centered at $\\omega_c = \\pm\\omega_0 = \\pm\\pi/M$.\n\nIn **Case A**, the signal $x[n]$ has bands at both $+\\omega_0$ and $-\\omega_0$.\n- The center of the positive frequency band, $\\omega_0 = \\pi/M$, is mapped to $\\omega' = M \\cdot (\\pi/M) = \\pi$.\n- The center of the negative frequency band, $-\\omega_0 = -\\pi/M$, is mapped to $\\omega' = M \\cdot (-\\pi/M) = -\\pi$.\n\nIn **Case B**, the signal $x[n]$ is first passed through the filter $h[n]$. The output of the filter, $v[n]$, has a spectrum $S_v(\\exp(j\\omega)) = |H(\\exp(j\\omega))|^2 S_x(\\exp(j\\omega))$. Since $H(\\exp(j\\omega))$ is non-zero only for $\\omega \\in [\\omega_0 - \\Delta, \\omega_0 + \\Delta]$, the spectrum $S_v(\\exp(j\\omega))$ is non-zero only in this positive frequency band.\n- The center of this single band, $\\omega_0 = \\pi/M$, is mapped to $\\omega' = M \\cdot (\\pi/M) = \\pi$.\n\nIn discrete-time frequency analysis, the frequencies $\\pi$ and $-\\pi$ are identical. Therefore, in both cases, the narrowband content is aliased to a new band centered at $\\omega' = \\pi$ radians.\n\n**Part 2: Total Output Power**\n\nThe total power in a band is the integral of the PSD over that band, divided by $2\\pi$.\n$P = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{\\text{band}} S(\\exp(j\\omega')) d\\omega'$.\n\n**Case A: Power of $y[n]$**\n\nThe PSD $S_y(\\exp(j\\omega'))$ is given by the aliasing formula applied to $S_x(\\exp(j\\omega))$. We analyze the sum for an $\\omega'$ in the aliased band around $\\pi$. Let $\\omega' \\in [\\pi - M\\Delta, \\pi) \\cup (-\\pi, -\\pi+M\\Delta]$. We need to find which values of $k \\in \\{0, 1, ..., M-1\\}$ cause the argument $(\\omega' - 2\\pi k)/M$ to fall into the support of $S_x(\\exp(j\\omega))$, which is $[\\omega_0 \\pm \\Delta] \\cup [-\\omega_0 \\pm \\Delta]$.\n\nFor $\\omega' \\in [\\pi - M\\Delta, \\pi)$, let $\\omega'=\\pi-\\delta$ with $0\\delta \\le M\\Delta$.\n- For $k=0$, the argument is $(\\pi-\\delta)/M = \\pi/M - \\delta/M = \\omega_0 - \\delta/M$. Since $\\delta/M \\le \\Delta$, this falls in the positive band $[\\omega_0-\\Delta, \\omega_0]$. The term in the sum is $S_b$.\n- For $k=1$, the argument is $(\\pi-\\delta-2\\pi)/M = -\\pi/M - \\delta/M = -\\omega_0 - \\delta/M$. This falls in the negative band $[-\\omega_0-\\Delta, -\\omega_0]$. The term in the sum is $S_b$.\n- For other $k$, the argument falls outside the support of $S_x$.\n\nSo for $\\omega'$ near $\\pi$, two terms in the sum are non-zero. The PSD of $y[n]$ is:\n$$S_y(\\exp(j\\omega')) = \\frac{1}{M}(S_b + S_b) = \\frac{2S_b}{M}$$\nSince $y[n]$ is a real process, its PSD is even: $S_y(\\exp(j\\omega')) = S_y(\\exp(-j\\omega'))$. The aliased band forms a single continuous region of width $2M\\Delta$ around $\\omega'=\\pi$ on the circular frequency axis, specifically on $[-\\pi, -\\pi+M\\Delta] \\cup [\\pi-M\\Delta, \\pi]$. The PSD is $\\frac{2S_b}{M}$ across this entire band.\n\nThe total power $P_y$ in this band is:\n$$P_y = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{\\text{aliased band}} S_y(\\exp(j\\omega')) d\\omega' = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left(\\frac{2S_b}{M}\\right) \\times (\\text{width of band})$$\n$$P_y = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left(\\frac{2S_b}{M}\\right) (2M\\Delta) = \\frac{2 S_b \\Delta}{\\pi}$$\n\n**Case B: Power of $z[n]$**\n\nThe process $v[n]$ has PSD $S_v(\\exp(j\\omega)) = S_b$ for $\\omega \\in [\\omega_0-\\Delta, \\omega_0+\\Delta]$ and zero elsewhere. We decimate $v[n]$ to get $z[n]$. The PSD is:\n$$S_z(\\exp(j\\omega')) = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} S_v\\left(\\exp\\left(j\\frac{\\omega' - 2\\pi k}{M}\\right)\\right)$$\nThe sum is non-zero only if $(\\omega' - 2\\pi k)/M$ falls in $[\\omega_0 - \\Delta, \\omega_0 + \\Delta]$.\n- For $\\omega' \\in [\\pi - M\\Delta, \\pi)$, only the $k=0$ term contributes, yielding $S_z(\\exp(j\\omega')) = S_b/M$.\n- For $\\omega' \\in [-\\pi, -\\pi+M\\Delta]$, let $\\omega'=-\\pi+\\delta$ with $0\\delta \\le M\\Delta$. The argument becomes $(-\\pi+\\delta-2\\pi k)/M$. For $k=1$, this is $(\\pi+\\delta)/M = \\omega_0+\\delta/M$, which is in $[\\omega_0, \\omega_0+\\Delta]$. So only the $k=1$ term contributes, yielding $S_z(\\exp(j\\omega')) = S_b/M$.\n\nThe aliased band for $z[n]$ is the same as for $y[n]$, with total width $2M\\Delta$. However, the PSD value on this band is $S_z(\\exp(j\\omega')) = S_b/M$.\n\nThe total power $P_z$ in this band is:\n$$P_z = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{\\text{aliased band}} S_z(\\exp(j\\omega')) d\\omega' = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left(\\frac{S_b}{M}\\right) \\times (\\text{width of band})$$\n$$P_z = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left(\\frac{S_b}{M}\\right) (2M\\Delta) = \\frac{S_b \\Delta}{\\pi}$$\n\nThe prefiltering in Case B eliminates aliasing from the negative frequency band, resulting in half the power of Case A.\n\nThe final answer requires a row matrix of the three derived quantities in order: aliased center frequency, power for $y[n]$, and power for $z[n]$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\pi  \\frac{2S_b\\Delta}{\\pi}  \\frac{S_b\\Delta}{\\pi} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2874145"}]}
