It is free of ambiguity and subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A rigorous solution can be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nFirst, we analyze the properties of the filter $h[n]$.\nThe filter length is $N=4R+1$ for an integer $R \\geq 1$. This is an odd integer. The filter possesses even symmetry, $h[n]=h[N-1-n]$, which makes it a Type 1 linear-phase FIR filter. The center of symmetry is at index $n_c = \\frac{N-1}{2} = \\frac{(4R+1)-1}{2} = 2R$.\n\nThe given property states that $h[n]=0$ for all odd $n$. Therefore, the only nonzero coefficients are at even indices $n \\in \\{0, 2, \\dots, 4R\\}$. The total number of potentially nonzero coefficients is $2R+1$.\nThe center tap is $h[2R] = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nDue to symmetry, $h[2k] = h[N-1-2k] = h[4R-2k]$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 2R\\}$.\nThe unique nonzero coefficient values that require multiplication are represented by $h[2k]$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, R-1\\}$ and the center tap $h[2R]$. This gives a total of $R+1$ unique coefficient values to be multiplied. Note that from $N=4R+1$, we have $R = \\frac{N-1}{4}$.\nThe number of unique nonzero coefficient values is $R+1 = \\frac{N-1}{4}+1 = \\frac{N+3}{4}$.\n\n#### Strategy 1: Direct-form “filter then decimate”\n\nIn this strategy, the filtering operation is performed at the high input sample rate, and the output is then downsampled by $M=2$. The convolution is $y_{\\text{full}}[n] = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} h[k]x[n-k]$.\n\nTo compute one sample of $y_{\\text{full}}[n]$, we exploit the filter's properties. The sum only needs to be performed over the $2R+1$ nonzero coefficients at even indices. Furthermore, exploiting symmetry allows us to pre-add input samples before multiplication.\nThe computation for one output sample $y_{\\text{full}}[n]$ is:\n$$y_{\\text{full}}[n] = h[2R]x[n-2R] + \\sum_{k=0}^{R-1} h[2k] \\left( x[n-2k] + x[n-(4R-2k)] \\right)$$\nThis requires $1$ multiplication for the center tap and $R$ multiplications for the symmetric pairs. The total number of multiplications to compute one sample $y_{\\text{full}}[n]$ is $C_{H} = R+1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of multiplications per final output sample $y[m]$. To obtain the sequence $y[m] = y_{\\text{full}}[2m]$, we are conceptually computing the entire sequence $y_{\\text{full}}[n]$ and discarding the odd-indexed samples. For every one sample $y[m]$ that is kept, one sample $y_{\\text{full}}[2m-1]$ is computed and discarded. Thus, the total computational work to produce one output sample $y[m]$ is the work required to compute two high-rate samples, $y_{\\text{full}}[2m-1]$ and $y_{\\text{full}}[2m]$.\n\nThe number of multiplications per final output sample is therefore $2 \\times C_{H}$.\n$$ C_1 = 2(R+1) = 2\\left(\\frac{N-1}{4}+1\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{N+3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{N+3}{2} $$\n\n#### Strategy 2: Two-branch polyphase decimator-by-2\n\nThis structure implements the decimation efficiently by rearranging the filtering operations. The filter $H(z)$ is decomposed into its Type 1 polyphase components: $H(z) = E_0(z^2) + z^{-1}E_1(z^2)$, where the polyphase filters are defined by the even and odd indexed coefficients of $h[n]$ respectively:\n$$ e_0[k] = h[2k] \\quad \\text{and} \\quad e_1[k] = h[2k+1] $$\nThe output is computed at the low rate as $y[m] = (x_e * e_0)[m] + (x_o * e_1)[m]$ where $x_e[m]=x[2m]$ and $x_o[m]=x[2m-1]$.\n\nAccording to the property given, $h[n]=0$ for all odd $n$. This directly implies that all coefficients of the second polyphase component are zero: $e_1[k] = h[2k+1] = 0$ for all $k$. Therefore, the filter $E_1(z)$ is zero, and the second branch of the polyphase structure contributes nothing to the output.\n\nThe computation simplifies to:\n$$ y[m] = \\sum_{k} e_0[k] x[2m-2k] $$\nThis is a single convolution of the filter $e_0[k]$ with the downsampled input sequence $x[2m]$, running at the output sample rate. We need to find the cost of this convolution.\n\nThe filter $e_0[k] = h[2k]$ has coefficients for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 2R\\}$. Its length is $L_0 = 2R+1$.\nWe check its symmetry: $e_0[k] = h[2k]$ and from the symmetry of $h[n]$, $h[2k] = h[4R-2k]$. The coefficient $e_0[2R-k] = h[2(2R-k)] = h[4R-2k]$. Thus, $e_0[k]=e_0[2R-k]$, meaning $e_0[k]$ is a symmetric filter of odd length $L_0=2R+1$.\n\nThe number of multiplications per output sample for a symmetric FIR filter of odd length $L_0$, exploiting symmetry, is $\\frac{L_0+1}{2}$.\nThe center tap of $e_0[k]$ is at index $k=R$ and has value $e_0[R] = h[2R] = \\frac{1}{2}$, which is nonzero and must be counted.\nThe computational cost for Strategy 2 is:\n$$ C_2 = \\frac{L_0+1}{2} = \\frac{(2R+1)+1}{2} = \\frac{2R+2}{2} = R+1 $$\nSubstituting $R = \\frac{N-1}{4}$:\n$$ C_2 = \\frac{N-1}{4} + 1 = \\frac{N+3}{4} $$\n\nThe number of real multiplications per output sample for the direct-form is $\\frac{N+3}{2}$ and for the polyphase form is $\\frac{N+3}{4}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{N+3}{2} & \\frac{N+3}{4} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2867572"}, {"introduction": "Moving from decimators to their dual, interpolators, this exercise shifts the focus from computational cost to system-level performance.

We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities related to a discrete-time interpolator. The interpolator increases the sampling rate by a factor of $M=2$ by first upsampling the input sequence $x[n]$ with zero insertion and then passing the result through a lowpass Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter $h[n]$.\n\n**1. Group Delay of the Interpolator**\n\nThe overall interpolation system consists of two stages: an upsampler-by-$2$ and an FIR filter $h[n]$.\nThe upsampler operation, defined as $x_{\\uparrow 2}[m] = x[m/2]$ for $m$ even and $x_{\\uparrow 2}[m]=0$ for $m$ odd, is a memoryless point-wise operation. It does not introduce any time delay into the signal path. Therefore, the group delay of the entire interpolator system is determined solely by the group delay of the post-interpolation filter, $h[n]$.\n\nThe filter $h[n]$ is specified as a real-coefficient, odd-length ($N$), linear-phase FIR filter with symmetry $h[n] = h[N-1-n]$. This corresponds to a Type I linear-phase FIR filter.\n\nThe frequency response of a Type I FIR filter can be written in the form:\n$$H(\\mathrm{e}^{j\\omega}) = A_e(\\omega) \\exp\\left(-j\\omega\\frac{N-1}{2}\\right)$$\nwhere $A_e(\\omega)$ is a real-valued amplitude function, and the phase response is $\\theta(\\omega) = -\\omega \\frac{N-1}{2}$.\n\nThe group delay, $\\tau_g(\\omega)$, is defined as the negative derivative of the phase response with respect to frequency:\n$$\\tau_g(\\omega) = -\\frac{d}{d\\omega} \\theta(\\omega) = -\\frac{d}{d\\omega} \\left(-\\omega\\frac{N-1}{2}\\right)$$\n$$\\tau_g(\\omega) = \\frac{N-1}{2}$$\nFor a Type I linear-phase FIR filter, the group delay is constant across all frequencies. The filter $h[n]$ operates on the upsampled signal, which is at the output sampling frequency $f_{s,\\mathrm{out}}$. Thus, its group delay is measured in units of the output sampling period, $T_{s,\\mathrm{out}} = 1/f_{s,\\mathrm{out}}$.\n\nThe problem asks for this group delay in units of output samples. The derived value is already in these units.\nGiven the filter length $N=81$, the group delay is:\n$$\\tau_g = \\frac{81-1}{2} = \\frac{80}{2} = 40$$\nThe group delay is $40$ output samples.\n\n**2. Minimum Imaging Attenuation for Target SFDR**\n\nLet the input signal be $x[n] = A \\cos(\\Omega_0 n + \\varphi)$. Its discrete-time radian frequency is $\\Omega_0$ with respect to the input sampling rate $f_{s,\\mathrm{in}}$.\n\nThe upsampling-by-$2$ operation with zero insertion produces the sequence $x_{\\uparrow 2}[m]$. The process of inserting a zero between each sample creates spectral images. For a sinusoidal input, this can be shown by expressing the zero-inserted sequence $x_{\\uparrow 2}[m]$ as the product of the original sequence (with its time axis scaled) and a sequence of alternating ones and zeros. This results in the original baseband signal and a spectral image.\n$$x_{\\uparrow 2}[m] = \\frac{A}{2} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\Omega_0}{2} m + \\varphi\\right) + \\frac{A}{2} \\cos\\left( \\left(\\pi - \\frac{\\Omega_0}{2}\\right)m - \\varphi \\right)$$\nThe upsampled signal $x_{\\uparrow 2}[m]$ entering the filter consists of two components:\n- **Desired Signal**: A sinusoid of amplitude $A/2$ at frequency $\\omega_d = \\Omega_0/2$. This frequency lies in the passband of the filter $h[n]$.\n- **Image Signal**: A sinusoid of amplitude $A/2$ at frequency $\\omega_{im} = \\pi - \\Omega_0/2$. This frequency lies in the stopband of the filter $h[n]$.\n\nThe signal $x_{\\uparrow 2}[m]$ is then passed through the filter $h[n]$.\n- The output amplitude of the desired signal is $A_{d,\\mathrm{out}} = (A/2) \\times |H(e^{j\\omega_d})|$. With the assumption of unity passband gain, $|H(e^{j\\omega_d})|=1$, so $A_{d,\\mathrm{out}} = A/2$.\n- The output amplitude of the spur (the attenuated image) is $A_{spur,\\mathrm{out}} = (A/2) \\times |H(e^{j\\omega_{im}})|$. The problem provides an upper bound for the filter's magnitude in the stopband: $|H(e^{j\\omega})| \\le 10^{-A_s/20}$ for $\\omega \\in \\mathrm{SB}$. The worst-case spur amplitude occurs when the filter response at the image frequency reaches this maximum allowed value.\n  $$A_{spur,\\mathrm{out}}^{\\max} = \\frac{A}{2} \\times 10^{-A_s/20}$$\n\nThe Spurious-Free Dynamic Range (SFDR) is the ratio of the desired signal amplitude to the amplitude of the strongest spurious component.\n$$SFDR = \\frac{A_{d,\\mathrm{out}}}{A_{spur,\\mathrm{out}}^{\\max}} = \\frac{A/2}{(A/2) \\times 10^{-A_s/20}} = \\frac{1}{10^{-A_s/20}} = 10^{A_s/20}$$\nExpressing the SFDR in decibels (dB), we get:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{dB}} = 20 \\log_{10}(SFDR) = 20 \\log_{10}(10^{A_s/20}) = A_s$$\nThis shows that for this system, the required minimum stopband attenuation in dB, $A_s^{\\star}$, is equal to the target SFDR in dB, $S_{\\mathrm{target}}$.\n$$A_s^{\\star} = S_{\\mathrm{target}}$$\nGiven a target SFDR of $S_{\\mathrm{target}}=92$ dB, the minimum required stopband attenuation is:\n$$A_s^{\\star} = 92 \\; \\mathrm{dB}$$\n\nThe final numeric pair is (group delay, required attenuation).\nThe group delay is $40$ samples.\nThe required attenuation is $92$ dB.\nBoth values are exact integers and do not require rounding.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 40 & 92 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2867566"}, {"introduction": "This practice moves from theoretical structures to the practical challenges of fixed-point implementation, a crucial step for deployment on hardware like FPGAs or ASICs.

A systematic validation reveals the problem to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains all necessary information and is free from contradictions or non-formalizable assertions. Therefore, I shall proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe problem requires the determination of three quantities related to the two-stage decimator: 1) a normalization scaling factor $2^{-k}$, 2) the additional bit width for the CIC integrator registers, and 3) the additional bit width for the compensation FIR accumulator. We will address each in turn, based on first principles.\n\nFirst, we determine the normalization factor $2^{-k}$ required to set the overall direct-current (DC) gain to unity. The total DC gain is the product of the DC gains of the individual stages in the cascade: the CIC filter, the scaler, and the FIR filter.\n\nThe transfer function of a CIC decimator, from the high-rate input to the low-rate output, has a DC gain of $(RM)^N$. With the given parameters $R=32$, $M=1$, and $N=3$, we have:\n$$\nG_{\\text{CIC,DC}} = (32 \\cdot 1)^3 = 32^3 = (2^5)^3 = 2^{15}\n$$\nThe DC gain of the FIR filter, $G_{\\text{FIR,DC}}$, is the sum of its coefficients, which is equivalent to evaluating its transfer function $H_{\\text{FIR}}(z') = \\sum_{j=0}^{4} h[j] (z')^{-j}$ at $z'=1$:\n$$\nG_{\\text{FIR,DC}} = \\sum_{j=0}^{4} h[j] = (-0.04) + 0.12 + 0.84 + 0.12 + (-0.04) = 1.00\n$$\nThe overall DC gain, $G_{\\text{total}}$, is the product of the gains of the CIC stage, the scaler $2^{-k}$, and the FIR stage. We set this to unity as required:\n$$\nG_{\\text{total}} = G_{\\text{CIC,DC}} \\cdot 2^{-k} \\cdot G_{\\text{FIR,DC}} = 1\n$$\n$$\n2^{15} \\cdot 2^{-k} \\cdot 1.0 = 1 \\implies 2^{-k} = 2^{-15}\n$$\nThis determines the normalization factor to be $2^{-15}$, which implies $k=15$.\n\nSecond, we determine the minimal additional number of bits for the CIC integrator registers to prevent overflow. The number of additional bits corresponds to the necessary headroom, which is determined by the maximum possible value that the registers must hold. The maximum value at the output of the $N$-th integrator stage is bounded by the product of the filter's gain and the maximum input amplitude. For a CIC filter, the worst-case gain up to the final integrator stage is $(RM)^N$.\nGiven an input signal $x[n]$ bounded by $|x[n]| \\le X_{\\max} = 0.5$, the maximum absolute value at the output of the final integrator stage, $|y_{N, \\max}|$, is:\n$$\n|y_{N, \\max}| \\le (RM)^N X_{\\max} = (32 \\cdot 1)^3 \\cdot 0.5 = 2^{15} \\cdot 2^{-1} = 2^{14}\n$$\nThe input signal is represented with $B_{\\mathrm{in}}=12$ bits in a normalized range of $[-1, 1)$, implying a fixed-point format with $0$ integer bits (the sign bit is not an integer bit). To represent the maximum output magnitude of $2^{14}$ without overflow in a two's complement system, the number of required integer bits, $I_{\\text{out}}$, is given by:\n$$\nI_{\\text{out}} = \\lceil \\log_2(|y_{N, \\max}|) \\rceil = \\lceil \\log_2(2^{14}) \\rceil = 14\n$$\nThe number of additional bits required is the increase in the number of integer bits from input to output. The input requires $I_{\\text{in}} = 0$ integer bits. Thus, the additional number of bits for the integrator registers is:\n$$\n\\Delta B_{\\text{CIC}} = I_{\\text{out}} - I_{\\text{in}} = 14 - 0 = 14\n$$\n\nThird, we determine the minimal additional bits for the FIR accumulator. The FIR filter processes the signal $v[n']$, which is the output of the CIC decimator scaled by $2^{-k}$. First, we find the maximum magnitude of $v[n']$. The maximum output of the entire CIC decimation filter, $|y_d|_{\\max}$, is bounded by the same value as its final integrator stage: $|y_d|_{\\max} \\le 2^{14}$.\nThe input to the FIR stage is $v[n'] = 2^{-k} y_d[n']$. Using $k=15$:\n$$\n|v|_{\\max} = \\max_n |v[n']| \\le 2^{-15} |y_d|_{\\max} = 2^{-15} \\cdot 2^{14} = 0.5\n$$\nTo prevent overflow in the FIR accumulator, we must find the maximum possible value of the convolution sum. A robust, worst-case bound for the output magnitude of an FIR filter is the product of the $\\ell_1$-norm of its coefficients and the maximum input magnitude. The $\\ell_1$-norm of the FIR filter, $\\|h\\|_1$, is:\n$$\n\\|h\\|_1 = \\sum_{j=0}^{4} |h[j]| = |-0.04| + |0.12| + |0.84| + |0.12| + |-0.04|\n$$\n$$\n\\|h\\|_1 = 0.04 + 0.12 + 0.84 + 0.12 + 0.04 = 1.16\n$$\nThe maximum value in the FIR accumulator, $|y_{\\text{FIR,acc}}|_{\\max}$, is therefore bounded by:\n$$\n|y_{\\text{FIR,acc}}|_{\\max} \\le \\|h\\|_1 \\cdot |v|_{\\max} = 1.16 \\cdot 0.5 = 0.58\n$$\nNow we determine the required bit growth. The FIR input signal $v[n']$ has a maximum magnitude of $0.5$. Since $0.5 < 1$, its representation requires $I_{\\text{FIR,in}} = 0$ integer bits. The accumulator output has a maximum magnitude of $0.58$. Since $0.58 < 1$, its representation also requires $I_{\\text{FIR,out}} = 0$ integer bits.\nThe number of additional bits required for the FIR accumulator is the difference:\n$$\n\\Delta B_{\\text{FIR}} = I_{\\text{FIR,out}} - I_{\\text{FIR,in}} = 0 - 0 = 0\n$$\nThe scaling factor $k=15$ is precisely the minimum integer value that ensures the FIR accumulator output magnitude remains below $1.0$, thus obviating the need for additional integer bits.\n\nThe final results are the normalization factor $2^{-15}$, the $14$ additional bits for the CIC integrator, and the $0$ additional bits for the FIR accumulator.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2^{-15} & 14 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2867568"}]}
