The problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Solution**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will now be formulated.\n\nFor a unity-feedback system, the closed-loop transfer function is $T(s) = \\frac{G(s)}{1+G(s)}$. The poles of the closed-loop system are the roots of the characteristic equation, which is given by:\n$$1 + G(s) = 0$$\nThe root locus is the set of all $s \\in \\mathbb{C}$ that satisfy this equation as the gain $K$ varies from $0$ to $\\infty$. Substituting the given open-loop transfer function $G(s) = \\frac{K}{s(s+2)(s+5)}$ into the characteristic equation yields:\n$$1 + \\frac{K}{s(s+2)(s+5)} = 0$$\nThis equation defines the relationship between the gain $K$ and the location $s$ of a closed-loop pole. We can express $K$ as a function of $s$ for any point on the root locus:\n$$K(s) = -s(s+2)(s+5)$$\nLet us expand this expression:\n$$K(s) = -s(s^2 + 7s + 10) = -s^3 - 7s^2 - 10s$$\n\nA breakaway point on the real axis is a location where at least two roots of the characteristic equation are identical. At such a point of multiplicity, $s$, a small change in gain, $\\Delta K$, results in a separation of the roots into the complex plane. This point of multiple roots corresponds to a location where the gain $K$ achieves a local maximum with respect to real values of $s$ on the locus segment. The condition for such a stationary point is that the derivative of $K$ with respect to $s$ must be zero.\n$$\\frac{dK}{ds} = 0$$\nThis is the general condition for determining breakaway and break-in points of a root locus. We will now apply this condition to the specific system.\n\nWe compute the derivative of $K(s)$:\n$$\\frac{dK}{ds} = \\frac{d}{ds}(-s^3 - 7s^2 - 10s) = -3s^2 - 14s - 10$$\nSetting the derivative to zero gives the locations of the stationary points:\n$$-3s^2 - 14s - 10 = 0$$\n$$3s^2 + 14s + 10 = 0$$\nWe solve this quadratic equation for $s$ using the quadratic formula, $s = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=3$, $b=14$, and $c=10$.\n$$s = \\frac{-14 \\pm \\sqrt{14^2 - 4(3)(10)}}{2(3)}$$\n$$s = \\frac{-14 \\pm \\sqrt{196 - 120}}{6}$$\n$$s = \\frac{-14 \\pm \\sqrt{76}}{6}$$\nSince $76 = 4 \\times 19$, we have $\\sqrt{76} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 19} = 2\\sqrt{19}$.\n$$s = \\frac{-14 \\pm 2\\sqrt{19}}{6}$$\n$$s = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{19}}{3}$$\nThe two real stationary points are $s_1 = \\frac{-7 + \\sqrt{19}}{3}$ and $s_2 = \\frac{-7 - \\sqrt{19}}{3}$.\n\nNext, we must determine which of these points, if any, lies on a segment of the root locus for $K  0$. The root locus on the real axis consists of all points to the left of an odd number of real open-loop poles and zeros. The open-loop poles are located at $s=0$, $s=-2$, and $s=-5$. There are no finite open-loop zeros.\nThe real-axis segments of the root locus are:\n1.  The interval $(-2, 0)$, which is to the left of one pole (at $s=0$).\n2.  The interval $(-\\infty, -5)$, which is to the left of three poles (at $s=0$, $s=-2$, $s=-5$).\nThe interval $(-5, -2)$ is to the left of two poles, so it is not part of the root locus for $K0$.\n\nNow we must locate the stationary points $s_1$ and $s_2$.

Also, for any $s$ in $(-2, 0)$, all factors in $K(s) = -s(s+2)(s+5)$ are such that the product is positive: $(-s)0$, $(s+2)0$, and $(s+5)0$. Therefore, $K(s_1)  0$. This point $s_1$ is a valid breakaway point.\n\nFor $s_2$:\n$$s_2 = \\frac{-7 - \\sqrt{19}}{3}$$\nSince $4  \\sqrt{19}  5$, we have $-7-5  -7-\\sqrt{19}  -7-4$, which means $-12  -7-\\sqrt{19}  -11$. Dividing by $3$ gives $-4  \\frac{-7-\\sqrt{19}}{3}  -\\frac{11}{3}$. So, $-4  s_2  -3.66...$.\nThis stationary point $s_2$ lies in the interval $(-4, -11/3)$, which is a subset of the interval $(-5, -2)$. This interval is not on the root locus for $K  0$. Therefore, $s_2$ is not the required breakaway point.

Number of Asymptotes**\n\nFor very large $|s|$, the highest power terms of the polynomials dominate. Thus, $N(s) \\approx s^m$ and $D(s) \\approx s^n$. The characteristic equation becomes approximately:\n$$s^n + K s^m \\approx 0$$\nAssuming $s \\neq 0$, we can write:\n$$s^{n-m} \\approx -K$$\nAs the gain $K$ varies from $0$ to $\\infty$, the magnitude of the roots of this equation, $|s|$, also varies from $0$ to $\\infty$. Specifically, $|s| \\approx K^{\\frac{1}{n-m}}$. This indicates that there are $n-m$ branches of the root locus that extend to infinity. Therefore, there are $n-m$ asymptotes.\n\n**2.

Their sum is:\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{n-m} s'_k = -(a_{n-1} - b_{m-1})$$\nAlso from Vieta's formulas, for the polynomials $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, we have:\n$$\\sum_{j=1}^{n} p_j = -a_{n-1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sum_{i=1}^{m} z_i = -b_{m-1}$$\nSubstituting these into the sum of asymptotic poles:\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{n-m} s'_k = -(-\\sum p_j - (-\\sum z_i)) = \\sum p_j - \\sum z_i$$\nThe asymptotes are straight lines that emanate from a common point on the real axis, the centroid $\\sigma_a$.

It is a completely standard and formal problem in control theory.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe closed-loop characteristic equation for a system in a negative unity-feedback loop is given by $1 + G(s) = 0$. Substituting the given open-loop transfer function $G(s) = \\frac{K\\,(s+1)}{(s+2)\\,(s+1+\\epsilon)}$, we obtain:\n$$\n1 + \\frac{K\\,(s+1)}{(s+2)\\,(s+1+\\epsilon)} = 0\n$$\nTo find the characteristic polynomial, we clear the denominator:\n$$\n(s+2)(s+1+\\epsilon) + K(s+1) = 0\n$$\nExpanding the terms yields:\n$$\ns^2 + s(1+\\epsilon) + 2s + 2(1+\\epsilon) + Ks + K = 0\n$$\nGrouping the terms by powers of $s$, we arrive at the characteristic polynomial $P(s)$:\n$$\nP(s) = s^2 + (3+\\epsilon+K)s + (2+2\\epsilon+K) = 0\n$$\nThis is the required characteristic polynomial for a general $\\epsilon \\ge 0$.\n\nNow, we consider the special case where $\\epsilon=0$. This corresponds to an exact pole-zero cancellation. The open-loop transfer function becomes $G(s) = \\frac{K(s+1)}{(s+2)(s+1)}$. A naive cancellation would suggest $G(s) = \\frac{K}{s+2}$, leading to the characteristic equation $1 + \\frac{K}{s+2} = 0$, or $s+2+K=0$. This would imply a single closed-loop pole at $s = -2-K$. This is an incorrect and dangerous simplification. The proper analysis uses the uncancelled characteristic equation: $(s+2)(s+1) + K(s+1) = 0$. This equation can be factored as:\n$$\n(s+1)(s+2+K) = 0\n$$\nThe roots are $s_1 = -1$ and $s_2 = -2-K$. This reveals there are two closed-loop poles. One pole is fixed at $s=-1$ for all $K \\ge 0$, a direct result of the pole-zero cancellation. This pole corresponds to a mode that is unobservable from the output and uncontrollable from the input. The second pole moves from $s=-2$ (for $K=0$) along the negative real axis towards $s \\to -\\infty$ as $K \\to \\infty$. The root locus consists of a stationary point at $s=-1$ and a branch from $s=-2$ to negative infinity.\n\nNext, for $\\epsilon  0$, we apply the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion to the characteristic polynomial $P(s) = s^2 + (3+\\epsilon+K)s + (2+2\\epsilon+K) = 0$. For a second-order polynomial $a_2s^2 + a_1s + a_0 = 0$, the system is stable if and only if all coefficients $a_2, a_1, a_0$ have the same sign.\nThe coefficients are:\n- $a_2 = 1$\n- $a_1 = 3+\\epsilon+K$\n- $a_0 = 2+2\\epsilon+K$\n\nGiven that $K \\ge 0$ and we are analyzing for $\\epsilon  0$:\n- $a_2 = 1$, which is positive.\n- $a_1 = 3+\\epsilon+K  3$, strictly positive.\n- $a_0 = 2+2\\epsilon+K  2$, strictly positive.\n\nSince all coefficients are strictly positive for any finite $K \\ge 0$ and any $\\epsilon  0$, the two roots of the characteristic polynomial (the closed-loop poles) must lie in the open left half-plane. Consequently, there exists no finite value of $K \\ge 0$ for which the closed-loop poles cross into the open right half-plane. The system is stable for all non-negative gain and any such small modeling error $\\epsilon$.\n\nFinally, we derive the location $s_{\\star}(K,\\epsilon)$ of the closed-loop pole that approaches $s=-1$ as $K \\to \\infty$. The closed-loop poles are the roots of the quadratic equation $s^2 + (3+\\epsilon+K)s + (2+2\\epsilon+K) = 0$. We solve for $s$ using the quadratic formula, $s = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=1$, $b=3+\\epsilon+K$, and $c=2+2\\epsilon+K$.\nThe discriminant $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta = (3+\\epsilon+K)^2 - 4(1)(2+2\\epsilon+K)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = (K+(3+\\epsilon))^2 - 4K - 8 - 8\\epsilon\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = K^2 + 2K(3+\\epsilon) + (3+\\epsilon)^2 - 4K - 8 - 8\\epsilon\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = K^2 + (6K+2K\\epsilon) + (9+6\\epsilon+\\epsilon^2) - 4K - 8 - 8\\epsilon\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = K^2 + (2K+2K\\epsilon) + (1-2\\epsilon+\\epsilon^2)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = K^2 + 2(1+\\epsilon)K + (1-\\epsilon)^2\n$$\nThe two closed-loop poles are therefore:\n$$\ns_{1,2} = \\frac{-(3+\\epsilon+K) \\pm \\sqrt{K^2 + 2(1+\\epsilon)K + (1-\\epsilon)^2}}{2}\n$$\nAs $K \\to \\infty$, the closed-loop poles approach the open-loop zeros. The open-loop transfer function $G(s)$ has one finite zero at $s=-1$. We must determine which root, $s_1$ or $s_2$, approaches this value. Let's analyze the behavior for large $K$. The term under the square root can be approximated using a Taylor expansion $\\sqrt{1+x} \\approx 1+x/2$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{K^2 + 2(1+\\epsilon)K + (1-\\epsilon)^2} = K\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2(1+\\epsilon)}{K} + \\frac{(1-\\epsilon)^2}{K^2}} \\approx K\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{2(1+\\epsilon)}{K}\\right) = K(1+\\frac{1+\\epsilon}{K}) = K+1+\\epsilon\n$$\nSubstituting this approximation into the expressions for the poles:\n- The pole with the plus sign: $s_+ \\approx \\frac{-(K+3+\\epsilon) + (K+1+\\epsilon)}{2} = \\frac{-2}{2} = -1$.\n- The pole with the minus sign: $s_- \\approx \\frac{-(K+3+\\epsilon) - (K+1+\\epsilon)}{2} = \\frac{-2K-4-2\\epsilon}{2} = -K-2-\\epsilon$.\nAs $K \\to \\infty$, $s_+ \\to -1$ and $s_- \\to -\\infty$. The pole of interest, $s_{\\star}(K,\\epsilon)$, is therefore the one with the plus sign in the numerator.\nThe exact analytic expression is:\n$$\ns_{\\star}(K,\\epsilon) = \\frac{-(K+3+\\epsilon) + \\sqrt{K^2 + 2(1+\\epsilon)K + (1-\\epsilon)^2}}{2}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{-(K+3+\\epsilon) + \\sqrt{K^2 + 2(1+\\epsilon)K + (1-\\epsilon)^2}}{2}}\n$$", "id": "2742222"}]}
