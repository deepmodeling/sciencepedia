We must first assess these two properties by computing the ranks of the controllability and observability matrices.\n\nFirst, we analyze controllability. The controllability matrix $\\mathcal{C}$ for a system of order $n$ is given by $\\mathcal{C} = \\begin{bmatrix} B & AB & \\cdots & A^{n-1}B \\end{bmatrix}$. For $n=4$, we have $\\mathcal{C} = \\begin{bmatrix} B & AB & A^2B & A^3B \\end{bmatrix}$.

The first two columns are linearly independent, while the last two are zero vectors. Thus, the rank of the controllability matrix is $\\text{rank}(\\mathcal{C}) = 2$. Since $\\text{rank}(\\mathcal{C}) = 2 < n = 4$, the system is not controllable.\n\nNext, we analyze observability. The observability matrix $\\mathcal{O}$ for a system of order $n$ is given by $\\mathcal{O} = \\begin{bmatrix} C \\\\ CA \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ CA^{n-1} \\end{bmatrix}$.

The fourth row is a scalar multiple of the third row ($R_4 = 2R_3$). The first three rows are linearly independent. Thus, the rank of the observability matrix is $\\text{rank}(\\mathcal{O}) = 3$. Since $\\text{rank}(\\mathcal{O}) = 3 < n = 4$, the system is not observable.\n\nAs the system is neither controllable nor observable, the given realization is not minimal.\n\nThe dimension of a minimal realization is known as the McMillan degree of the system. It is equal to the order of the system's transfer function $G(s) = C(sI-A)^{-1}B + D$.

The order of a rational transfer function is the degree of its denominator polynomial, assuming the fraction is irreducible. Here, the degree is $2$.\nThis order is the McMillan degree, which corresponds to the dimension of any minimal realization of the system. The uncontrollable and unobservable modes in the original $n=4$ state-space realization are cancelled in the transfer function.\nTherefore, the dimension of a minimal realization is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2882884"}, {"introduction": "A common source of non-minimal realizations is the cancellation of poles and zeros in the system's transfer function.

It is a standard problem in linear systems theory. As such, I will proceed with its resolution.\n\nThe problem is to find a minimal realization and corresponding transfer function for a system described by\n$$\nG(s) = \\frac{s - 1}{(s - 1)(s + 2)}.\n$$\nThe procedure will be executed in three parts as specified.\n\nPart $1$: Construction of a Non-Minimal Realization\n\nThe transfer function of a linear time-invariant (LTI) state-space system $(A,B,C,D)$ is given by the formula $H(s) = C(sI - A)^{-1}B + D$.\nWe are given a diagonal state matrix $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$ and direct term $D = 0$. The state dimension is $n=2$.\nFirst, we compute the matrix $(sI - A)^{-1}$:\n$$\nsI - A = \\begin{pmatrix} s & 0 \\\\ 0 & s \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} s-1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & s+2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n(sI - A)^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{s-1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{s+2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nLet the input and output matrices be $B = \\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $C = \\begin{pmatrix} c_1 & c_2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The transfer function is then:\n$$\nH(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} c_1 & c_2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{s-1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{s+2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{c_1 b_1}{s-1} + \\frac{c_2 b_2}{s+2}\n$$\nCombining the terms over a common denominator gives:\n$$\nH(s) = \\frac{c_1 b_1 (s+2) + c_2 b_2 (s-1)}{(s-1)(s+2)} = \\frac{(c_1 b_1 + c_2 b_2)s + (2c_1 b_1 - c_2 b_2)}{(s-1)(s+2)}\n$$\nThis realization's transfer function $H(s)$ must coincide with the given $G(s) = \\frac{s-1}{(s-1)(s+2)}$. By equating the numerators, we obtain a system of linear equations for the products $p_1 = c_1 b_1$ and $p_2 = c_2 b_2$:\n\\begin{align*} c_1 b_1 + c_2 b_2 &= 1 \\\\ 2c_1 b_1 - c_2 b_2 &= -1 \\end{align*}\nAdding the two equations yields $3c_1 b_1 = 0$, which implies $c_1 b_1 = 0$. Substituting this back into the first equation gives $c_2 b_2 = 1$.\n\nThe condition $c_1 b_1 = 0$ is the source of the pole-zero cancellation at $s=1$. This cancellation signifies that the mode associated with the eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1$ is either uncontrollable (if $b_1=0$) or unobservable (if $c_1=0$), or both. We must construct one such realization.\n\nLet us choose to make the mode at $s=1$ uncontrollable. This requires setting $b_1 = 0$. The condition $c_1 b_1 = 0$ is thus satisfied for any choice of $c_1$. The second condition, $c_2 b_2 = 1$, can be satisfied by choosing, for example, $b_2 = 1$ and $c_2 = 1$. To ensure the system is not needlessly degenerate, we can choose a non-zero $c_1$, for instance $c_1 = 1$.\n\nAn explicit non-minimal realization is therefore:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad C = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad D = 0\n$$\n\nPart $2$: Controllability, Observability, and Reduction\n\nWe now analyze the properties of the constructed realization.\nThe controllability matrix is $\\mathcal{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} B & AB \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$$\nAB = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe rank of $\\mathcal{C}$ is $\\text{rank}(\\mathcal{C}) = 1$. Since the rank is less than the state dimension $n=2$, the system is not completely controllable. The uncontrollable mode is associated with the eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1$. This is confirmed by the Hautus-Popov-Belevitch test: $\\text{rank}\\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_1 I - A & B \\end{pmatrix} = \\text{rank}\\begin{pmatrix} 1I - A & B \\end{pmatrix} = \\text{rank}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = 1 < 2$.\n\nThe observability matrix is $\\mathcal{O} = \\begin{pmatrix} C \\\\ CA \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$$\nCA = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{O} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of $\\mathcal{O}$ is $(1)(-2) - (1)(1) = -3 \\neq 0$. The rank of $\\mathcal{O}$ is $2$, so the system is completely observable.\nThe realization is non-minimal because it is not completely controllable.\n\nTo find the minimal realization, we apply the Kalman decomposition.

The controllable subspace is the range of $\\mathcal{C}$, which is $\\text{span}\\left\\{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right\\}$. The uncontrollable subspace corresponds to $\\text{span}\\left\\{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right\\}$.

The recurrence relation is:\n$$\ng[k+2] + \\alpha_1 g[k+1] + \\alpha_0 g[k] = 0\n$$\nWe can use the given impulse response values to form a system of linear equations for the coefficients $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_0$.\nFor $k=1$:\n$$\ng[3] + \\alpha_1 g[2] + \\alpha_0 g[1] = 0 \\implies \\frac{13}{36} + \\alpha_1 \\frac{5}{6} + \\alpha_0 (2) = 0\n$$\nFor $k=2$:\n$$\ng[4] + \\alpha_1 g[3] + \\alpha_0 g[2] = 0 \\implies \\frac{35}{216} + \\alpha_1 \\frac{13}{36} + \\alpha_0 \\frac{5}{6} = 0\n$$\nThis gives the following system of equations:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n2\\alpha_0 + \\frac{5}{6}\\alpha_1 = -\\frac{13}{36} \\\\\n\\frac{5}{6}\\alpha_0 + \\frac{13}{36}\\alpha_1 = -\\frac{35}{216}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nMultiplying the first equation by $72$ and the second by $216$ to clear denominators:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n144\\alpha_0 + 60\\alpha_1 = -26 \\\\\n180\\alpha_0 + 78\\alpha_1 = -35\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nDividing the first by $2$ and using the matrix form $\\begin{pmatrix} g[1] & g[2] \\\\ g[2] & g[3] \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha_0 \\\\ \\alpha_1 \\end{pmatrix} = -\\begin{pmatrix} g[3] \\\\ g[4] \\end{pmatrix}$ which is $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 5/6 \\\\ 5/6 & 13/36 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha_0 \\\\ \\alpha_1 \\end{pmatrix} = -\\begin{pmatrix} 13/36 \\\\ 35/216 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe solution is $\\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha_0 \\\\ \\alpha_1 \\end{pmatrix} = - \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 5/6 \\\\ 5/6 & 13/36 \\end{pmatrix}^{-1} \\begin{pmatrix} 13/36 \\\\ 35/216 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe inverse of the matrix is $\\frac{1}{1/36} \\begin{pmatrix} 13/36 & -5/6 \\\\ -5/6 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = 36 \\begin{pmatrix} 13/36 & -5/6 \\\\ -5/6 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 13 & -30 \\\\ -30 & 72 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSo,\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha_0 \\\\ \\alpha_1 \\end{pmatrix} = - \\begin{pmatrix} 13 & -30 \\\\ -30 & 72 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 13/36 \\\\ 35/216 \\end{pmatrix} = - \\begin{pmatrix} 13(\\frac{13}{36}) - 30(\\frac{35}{216}) \\\\ -30(\\frac{13}{36}) + 72(\\frac{35}{216}) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n= - \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{169}{36} - \\frac{1050}{216} \\\\ -\\frac{390}{36} + \\frac{2520}{216} \\end{pmatrix} = - \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1014}{216} - \\frac{1050}{216} \\\\ -\\frac{2340}{216} + \\frac{2520}{216} \\end{pmatrix} = - \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{36}{216} \\\\ \\frac{180}{216} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{6} \\\\ -\\frac{5}{6} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThus, we find $\\alpha_0 = \\frac{1}{6}$ and $\\alpha_1 = -\\frac{5}{6}$.\n\nTo confirm that the order is indeed $n=2$, we must verify that this recurrence relation holds for the next term, $k=3$.\n$$\ng[5] + \\alpha_1 g[4] + \\alpha_0 g[3] = \\frac{97}{1296} + \\left(-\\frac{5}{6}\\right)\\left(\\frac{35}{216}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)\\left(\\frac{13}{36}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{97}{1296} - \\frac{175}{1296} + \\frac{13}{216} = \\frac{-78}{1296} + \\frac{13 \\times 6}{216 \\times 6} = \\frac{-78}{1296} + \\frac{78}{1296} = 0\n$$\nThe relation holds. This confirms that the minimal order of the system is $n=2$.\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of the system matrix $A$ is $\\alpha(z) = z^2 - \\frac{5}{6}z + \\frac{1}{6}$. The system poles are the roots of $\\alpha(z)=0$.\n$$\nz^2 - \\frac{5}{6}z + \\frac{1}{6} = 0\n$$\nMultiplying by $6$ to clear the fractions gives:\n$$\n6z^2 - 5z + 1 = 0\n$$\nThis quadratic equation can be factored as $(2z-1)(3z-1)=0$.\nThe roots, which are the poles of the system, are:\n$$\np_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad p_2 = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nThe problem states that the system is asymptotically stable, which requires all poles to have a magnitude less than $1$. Here, $|p_1| = \\frac{1}{2} < 1$ and $|p_2| = \\frac{1}{3} < 1$, so this condition is satisfied.\n\nThe problem asks for the larger-magnitude pole. Comparing the magnitudes:\n$$\n|p_1| = \\frac{1}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad |p_2| = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nClearly, $\\frac{1}{2} > \\frac{1}{3}$.\nThe pole corresponding to the larger magnitude is $p_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$", "id": "2882862"}]}
