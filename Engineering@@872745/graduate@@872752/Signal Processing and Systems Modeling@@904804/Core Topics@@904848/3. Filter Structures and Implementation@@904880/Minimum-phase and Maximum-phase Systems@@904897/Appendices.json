No numerical approximation or rounding is required; give an exact analytic expression.", "solution": "We begin from fundamental definitions for rational discrete-time linear time-invariant systems in the complex $z$-domain.\n\nA rational transfer function $H(z)$ is causal if its region of convergence is of the form $|z| > r_{p}$, where $r_{p}$ is the magnitude of the pole with largest magnitude. It is anti-causal if its region of convergence is of the form $|z| < r_{p, \\min}$, where $r_{p, \\min}$ is the magnitude of the pole with smallest magnitude. A system is Bounded-Input Bounded-Output (BIBO) stable if and only if its region of convergence includes the unit circle $|z|=1$. A stable causal system is minimum-phase if and only if all of its zeros lie strictly inside the unit circle.\n\nStep 1: Analyze $H(z)$ for causality, stability, and minimum-phase property.\n\nGiven\n$$\nH(z) = \\frac{1 - \\frac{3}{2} z^{-1}}{1 - \\frac{1}{2} z^{-1}}.\n$$\nThe pole is at the root of $1 - \\frac{1}{2} z^{-1} = 0$, that is $z = \\frac{1}{2}$. The zero is at the root of $1 - \\frac{3}{2} z^{-1} = 0$, that is $z = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\n- Causality: A rational transfer function with a single pole at $z = \\frac{1}{2}$ has the natural causal region of convergence $|z| > \\frac{1}{2}$. This is consistent with the right-sided impulse response of a first-order causal system. Therefore $H(z)$ is causal.\n\n- BIBO stability: The causal region of convergence $|z| > \\frac{1}{2}$ contains the unit circle $|z| = 1$, because $1 > \\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore the system is BIBO stable.\n\n- Minimum-phase: A stable causal system is minimum-phase when all zeros lie strictly inside the unit circle. Here the zero is at $z = \\frac{3}{2}$, which lies outside the unit circle. Therefore $H(z)$ is nonminimum-phase.\n\nStep 2: Form $H^{-1}(z)$ and analyze realizability and stability.\n\nCompute the inverse transfer function:\n$$\nH^{-1}(z) = \\frac{1}{H(z)} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{2} z^{-1}}{1 - \\frac{3}{2} z^{-1}}.\n$$\nThe pole of $H^{-1}(z)$ is at the zero of $H(z)$, namely $z = \\frac{3}{2}$. The zero of $H^{-1}(z)$ is at the pole of $H(z)$, namely $z = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n- Causal realization of $H^{-1}(z)$: If we insist on causality, the region of convergence must be the exterior of the outermost pole, i.e., $|z| > \\frac{3}{2}$. However, $|z| = 1$ is not contained in $|z| > \\frac{3}{2}$, because $1$ is not greater than $\\frac{3}{2}$. Therefore the unit circle is excluded, and the causal realization of $H^{-1}(z)$ is not BIBO stable.\n\n- BIBO-stable realization of $H^{-1}(z)$: BIBO stability requires that the unit circle $|z| = 1$ be included in the region of convergence. Since the pole is at $z = \\frac{3}{2}$ (outside the unit circle), any region of convergence that includes $|z| = 1$ but does not cross a pole must satisfy $|z| < \\frac{3}{2}$. This is an interior region of convergence, which is the hallmark of an anti-causal realization. Therefore any BIBO-stable realization of $H^{-1}(z)$ is necessarily noncausal (specifically, anti-causal).\n\nThis establishes that $H^{-1}(z)$ is either noncausal (if BIBO-stable) or unstable (if causal).\n\nStep 3: Compute the impulse response $h_{s}[n]$ of the BIBO-stable realization of $H^{-1}(z)$.\n\nWe first perform a partial fraction decomposition to separate a term that is independent of the region of convergence from a first-order term:\n$$\nH^{-1}(z) = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{2} z^{-1}}{1 - \\frac{3}{2} z^{-1}} = A + \\frac{B}{1 - \\frac{3}{2} z^{-1}}.\n$$\nSolve for $A$ and $B$ by matching coefficients:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{1}{2} z^{-1} = A \\left(1 - \\frac{3}{2} z^{-1}\\right) + B.\n$$\nEquating constant and $z^{-1}$ coefficients,\n$$\n1 = A + B, \\quad -\\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{3}{2} A.\n$$\nThus\n$$\nA = \\frac{1}{3}, \\quad B = \\frac{2}{3},\n$$\nand hence\n$$\nH^{-1}(z) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{\\frac{2}{3}}{1 - \\frac{3}{2} z^{-1}}.\n$$\n\nFor the BIBO-stable realization, the region of convergence is $|z| < \\frac{3}{2}$. We now recall and derive the anti-causal $z$-transform pair from the geometric series. For $|z| < |a|$,\n$$\n\\frac{1}{1 - a z^{-1}} = \\frac{z}{z - a} = - \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{-1} a^{n} z^{-n},\n$$\nsince\n$$\n- \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{-1} a^{n} z^{-n} = - \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} a^{-m} z^{m} = - \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{z}{a}\\right)^{m} = - \\frac{\\frac{z}{a}}{1 - \\frac{z}{a}} = \\frac{z}{z - a}.\n$$\nTherefore, with $a = \\frac{3}{2}$ and region of convergence $|z| < \\frac{3}{2}$,\n$$\n\\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{3}{2} z^{-1}} \\;\\;\\xleftrightarrow{\\mathcal{Z}^{-1}}\\;\\; - \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{n} u[-n-1],\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\frac{1}{3} \\;\\;\\xleftrightarrow{\\mathcal{Z}^{-1}}\\;\\; \\frac{1}{3} \\,\\delta[n].\n$$\n\nCombining these terms linearly,\n$$\nh_{s}[n] = \\frac{1}{3} \\,\\delta[n] + \\frac{2}{3} \\left[ - \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{n} u[-n-1] \\right] = \\frac{1}{3} \\,\\delta[n] - \\frac{2}{3} \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{n} u[-n-1].\n$$\nThis impulse response is anti-causal (nonzero for $n \\leq -1$ and possibly at $n=0$), and its region of convergence $|z| < \\frac{3}{2}$ includes the unit circle, ensuring BIBO stability. Hence it is the BIBO-stable realization of $H^{-1}(z)$.\n\nThis completes the construction of a stable causal nonminimum-phase $H(z)$ and the explicit demonstration that $H^{-1}(z)$ is either noncausal (if BIBO-stable) or unstable (if causal), together with the requested exact expression for the impulse response of the BIBO-stable inverse.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}\\,\\delta[n]\\;-\\;\\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{n}u[-n-1]}$$", "id": "2883515"}, {"introduction": "A fundamental duality exists between maximum-phase and minimum-phase systems, which can be revealed through operations in the time domain.

Angles are to be interpreted in radians. Use only foundational definitions and properties of the $Z$-transform, causality, and the definitions of minimum-phase and maximum-phase systems stated as follows: a discrete-time linear time-invariant system is minimum-phase if and only if all its zeros are strictly inside the unit circle, and maximum-phase if and only if all its zeros are strictly outside the unit circle.\n\nConstruct an explicit real-coefficient $H(z)$ by specifying a set of zeros such that every zero is strictly outside the unit circle and the normalization $h[0]=1$ holds.

No numerical rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent, providing all necessary definitions and data for a unique solution. We will proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nFirst, we construct the transfer function $H(z)$ for the specified length-$4$ FIR filter. The filter has an impulse response $\\{h[n]\\}_{n=0}^{3}$ and its $Z$-transform is $H(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{3} h[n] z^{-n}$. This is a polynomial of degree $3$ in the variable $z^{-1}$. A degree-$3$ polynomial is characterized by its $3$ zeros and a scaling constant.\n\nThe problem states the zeros are located at $z_1 = 2 \\exp(j\\pi/3)$, $z_2 = 2 \\exp(-j\\pi/3)$, and $z_3 = 3$. The general form of $H(z)$ is thus:\n$$H(z) = C \\left(1 - z_1 z^{-1}\\right) \\left(1 - z_2 z^{-1}\\right) \\left(1 - z_3 z^{-1}\\right)$$\nThe constant $C$ is determined by the normalization condition $h[0]=1$. By expanding the expression for $H(z)$, we see that the term independent of $z^{-1}$ is $C$. That is, $h[0] = C$. Therefore, we must have $C=1$.\n\nWith $C=1$, the transfer function is:\n$$H(z) = \\left(1 - 2 \\exp(j\\pi/3) z^{-1}\\right) \\left(1 - 2 \\exp(-j\\pi/3) z^{-1}\\right) \\left(1 - 3 z^{-1}\\right)$$\nTo verify the coefficients are real, we combine the complex-conjugate pair of factors:\n$$ \\left(1 - 2 \\exp(j\\pi/3) z^{-1}\\right) \\left(1 - 2 \\exp(-j\\pi/3) z^{-1}\\right) = 1 - 2\\left(\\exp(j\\pi/3) + \\exp(-j\\pi/3)\\right)z^{-1} + 4\\exp(0)z^{-2} $$\nUsing Euler's identity, $\\exp(j\\theta) + \\exp(-j\\theta) = 2 \\cos(\\theta)$, we have:\n$$ 1 - 2\\left(2\\cos(\\pi/3)\\right)z^{-1} + 4z^{-2} = 1 - 2\\left(2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\right)z^{-1} + 4z^{-2} = 1 - 2z^{-1} + 4z^{-2} $$\nMultiplying by the remaining factor $(1 - 3z^{-1})$ gives:\n$$ H(z) = (1 - 2z^{-1} + 4z^{-2})(1 - 3z^{-1}) = 1 - 3z^{-1} - 2z^{-1} + 6z^{-2} + 4z^{-2} - 12z^{-3} $$\n$$ H(z) = 1 - 5z^{-1} + 10z^{-2} - 12z^{-3} $$\nFrom this, the impulse response is $\\{h[n]\\} = \\{1, -5, 10, -12\\}$. The coefficients are real, as required. The magnitudes of the zeros are $|z_1|=2 > 1$, $|z_2|=2 > 1$, and $|z_3|=3 > 1$. Since all zeros are strictly outside the unit circle, the system $H(z)$ is, by definition, maximum-phase.\n\nNext, we derive the $Z$-transform $H_{\\mathrm{rev}}(z)$ of the time-reversed impulse response $h_{\\mathrm{rev}}[n] \\triangleq h[3-n]$. By the definition of the bilateral $Z$-transform:\n$$ H_{\\mathrm{rev}}(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h_{\\mathrm{rev}}[n] z^{-n} = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[3-n] z^{-n} $$\nThe sequence $h[n]$ is non-zero only for $n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. Thus, $h_{\\mathrm{rev}}[n]$ is also non-zero only for $n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. We introduce a change of variables in the summation, $m = 3-n$, which implies $n = 3-m$. As $n$ goes from $0$ to $3$, $m$ goes from $3$ to $0$.\n$$ H_{\\mathrm{rev}}(z) = \\sum_{m=0}^{3} h[m] z^{-(3-m)} = \\sum_{m=0}^{3} h[m] z^{-3} z^m = z^{-3} \\sum_{m=0}^{3} h[m] (z^{-1})^{-m} $$\nThe sum is the definition of $H(z^{-1})$, so we establish the relationship:\n$$ H_{\\mathrm{rev}}(z) = z^{-3} H(z^{-1}) $$\nTo find the zeros of $H_{\\mathrm{rev}}(z)$, let $p$ be a zero. Then $H_{\\mathrm{rev}}(p)=0$. For any $p \\neq 0$, this implies $p^{-3} H(p^{-1}) = 0$, which requires $H(p^{-1}) = 0$. This means that $p^{-1}$ must be a zero of $H(z)$. Therefore, if the zeros of $H(z)$ are $\\{z_k\\}$, the zeros of $H_{\\mathrm{rev}}(z)$ are $\\{p_k\\} = \\{1/z_k\\}$.\n\nThe zeros of $H(z)$ are $2 \\exp(j\\pi/3)$, $2 \\exp(-j\\pi/3)$, and $3$. The zeros of $H_{\\mathrm{rev}}(z)$ are therefore:\n$$ p_1 = \\frac{1}{2 \\exp(j\\pi/3)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\exp(-j\\pi/3) $$\n$$ p_2 = \\frac{1}{2 \\exp(-j\\pi/3)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\exp(j\\pi/3) $$\n$$ p_3 = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nThe magnitudes of these zeros are $|p_1|=1/2$, $|p_2|=1/2$, and $|p_3|=1/3$. All three magnitudes are strictly less than $1$. According to the problem's definition, a system is minimum-phase if and only if all its zeros are strictly inside the unit circle. Thus, the system with impulse response $h_{\\mathrm{rev}}[n]$ is minimum-phase.\n\nFinally, we construct the transfer function $\\tilde{H}(z)$ for the delay-aligned sequence $\\tilde{h}[n]$. This sequence is defined as the time-reversed impulse response normalized to satisfy $\\tilde{h}[0]=1$. The time-reversed sequence is $h_{\\mathrm{rev}}[n] = h[3-n]$. Its coefficients are:\n$h_{\\mathrm{rev}}[0] = h[3] = -12$\n$h_{\\mathrm{rev}}[1] = h[2] = 10$\n$h_{\\mathrm{rev}}[2] = h[1] = -5$\n$h_{\\mathrm{rev}}[3] = h[0] = 1$\nSo, the Z-transform is $H_{\\mathrm{rev}}(z) = -12 + 10z^{-1} - 5z^{-2} + z^{-3}$.\nThe sequence $\\tilde{h}[n]$ is a scaled version of $h_{\\mathrm{rev}}[n]$, i.e., $\\tilde{h}[n] = A \\cdot h_{\\mathrm{rev}}[n]$. The normalization constant $A$ is found from the condition $\\tilde{h}[0]=1$:\n$$ \\tilde{h}[0] = A \\cdot h_{\\mathrm{rev}}[0] = A \\cdot (-12) = 1 \\implies A = -\\frac{1}{12} $$\nThe Z-transform $\\tilde{H}(z)$ is therefore linearly related to $H_{\\mathrm{rev}}(z)$:\n$$ \\tilde{H}(z) = \\mathcal{Z}\\{\\tilde{h}[n]\\} = -\\frac{1}{12} H_{\\mathrm{rev}}(z) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $H_{\\mathrm{rev}}(z)$:\n$$ \\tilde{H}(z) = -\\frac{1}{12} \\left(-12 + 10z^{-1} - 5z^{-2} + z^{-3}\\right) $$\nDistributing the constant gives the final analytic expression:\n$$ \\tilde{H}(z) = 1 - \\frac{10}{12}z^{-1} + \\frac{5}{12}z^{-2} - \\frac{1}{12}z^{-3} = 1 - \\frac{5}{6}z^{-1} + \\frac{5}{12}z^{-2} - \\frac{1}{12}z^{-3} $$\nThis function $\\tilde{H}(z)$ corresponds to a minimum-phase system with real coefficients, normalized such that its first impulse response coefficient is $1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1 - \\frac{5}{6}z^{-1} + \\frac{5}{12}z^{-2} - \\frac{1}{12}z^{-3}}\n$$", "id": "2883573"}, {"introduction": "The theoretical distinctions between minimum-phase and maximum-phase systems become particularly sharp when we consider the boundary case: a system with a zero located directly on the unit circle.

This ROC does not include the unit circle, so the causal inverse is not BIBO stable. This part of the statement is correct.\n- An anticausal inverse has ROC $|z| < |p_0| = 1+\\epsilon$. Since $1+\\epsilon > 1$, this ROC includes the unit circle.\n- Thus, the anticausal realization is BIBO stable. This part of the statement is also correct.\n- All claims in the statement are correct.\nVerdict on C: **Correct**.\n\nD. Systems with a zero on the unit circle $\\{ z: |z| = 1 \\}$ are robustly invertible in the sense that arbitrarily small coefficient perturbations cannot destroy the BIBO stability of any causal inverse.\n- This statement is philosophically and technically flawed. A system with a zero on the unit circle, such as $H_{1}(z)$, has an inverse $H_{1}^{-1}(z)$ with a pole on the unit circle. The causal version of this inverse is not BIBO stable to begin with. There is no stability to \"destroy\".\n- Furthermore, the analysis in B and C demonstrates the opposite of robustness. The stability of the causal inverse depends critically on the direction of the perturbation.\n- Perturbing the zero to be inside the unit circle (as in B, $\\rho = 1-\\epsilon$) leads to a stable causal inverse.\n- Perturbing the zero to be outside the unit circle (as in C, $\\rho = 1+\\epsilon$) leads to an unstable causal inverse.\n- A zero on the unit circle represents a point of fragility, not robustness, for the stability of a causal inverse. The statement is fundamentally incorrect.\nVerdict on D: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. Although moving the zero from $|z| = 1$ slightly changes magnitude response, phase and group delay of the inverse remain uniformly bounded as $\\rho \\to 1$, and the $\\ell_{1}$ norm of the inverse impulse response does not blow up when $\\rho \\uparrow 1$ from below.\n- This statement concerns the behavior of the causal stable inverse $H_{\\rho}^{-1}(z)$ for $\\rho < 1$ as $\\rho$ approaches $1$ from below ($\\rho \\uparrow 1$).\n- The frequency response of the inverse is $H_{\\rho}^{-1}(e^{j\\omega}) = \\frac{1}{1 - \\rho e^{j \\omega_{0}} e^{-j\\omega}}$. At $\\omega = \\omega_{0}$, its magnitude is $|H_{\\rho}^{-1}(e^{j\\omega_0})| = \\frac{1}{|1 - \\rho|} = \\frac{1}{1-\\rho}$, since $\\rho < 1$. As $\\rho \\uparrow 1$, this magnitude approaches infinity. The magnitude response is not uniformly bounded.\n- The group delay of the inverse system is $\\tau_g(\\omega) = -\\frac{d}{d\\omega} \\arg[H_{\\rho}^{-1}(e^{j\\omega})]$. A standard calculation for this first-order all-pole filter yields $\\tau_g(\\omega) = \\frac{\\rho^2 - \\rho \\cos(\\omega - \\omega_0)}{1 + \\rho^2 - 2\\rho \\cos(\\omega - \\omega_0)}$. At the resonance frequency $\\omega = \\omega_0$, the group delay is $\\tau_g(\\omega_0) = \\frac{\\rho^2 - \\rho}{1 + \\rho^2 - 2\\rho} = \\frac{\\rho(\\rho - 1)}{(1-\\rho)^2} = \\frac{\\rho}{1-\\rho}$. As $\\rho \\uparrow 1$, $\\tau_g(\\omega_0) \\to \\infty$. The group delay is not uniformly bounded.\n- The impulse response of the causal stable inverse is $h_{\\rho}^{-1}[n] = (\\rho e^{j\\omega_0})^n u[n]$ for $\\rho < 1$.\n- The $\\ell_1$ norm of this impulse response is $\\|h_{\\rho}^{-1}\\|_{\\ell_1} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} |(\\rho e^{j\\omega_0})^n| = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\rho^n$. For $\\rho < 1$, this geometric series sums to $\\frac{1}{1-\\rho}$.\n- As $\\rho \\uparrow 1$, the $\\ell_1$ norm $\\frac{1}{1-\\rho} \\to \\infty$. Thus, the norm \"blows up\".\n- Every quantitative claim in this statement is demonstrably false.\nVerdict on E: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, statements A, B, and C are correct, while D and E are incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "2883574"}]}
