It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe output $x[n]$ of an LTI system is given by the convolution of the input $w[n]$ with the system's impulse response $h[n]$:\n$$x[n] = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[m] w[n-m]$$\nThe impulse response $h[n]$ is the inverse Z-transform of the transfer function $H(z)$. For the given causal system, we have:\n$$H(z) = \\frac{1}{1-0.8 z^{-1}} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (0.8)^n z^{-n}$$\nBy inspection, the impulse response is $h[n] = (0.8)^n u[n]$, where $u[n]$ is the discrete-time unit step function.\n\nThe autocorrelation of the output process $x[n]$ is defined as $r_{x}[k] = \\mathbb{E}\\{x[n] x[n-k]\\}$. Substituting the convolution expression for $x[n]$:\n$$r_{x}[k] = \\mathbb{E}\\left\\{ \\left(\\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[m] w[n-m]\\right) \\left(\\sum_{l=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[l] w[n-k-l]\\right) \\right\\}$$\nUsing the linearity of the expectation operator, we can move it inside the sums:\n$$r_{x}[k] = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\sum_{l=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[m] h[l] \\mathbb{E}\\{w[n-m] w[n-k-l]\\}$$\nThe input $w[n]$ is a white noise process with unit variance, meaning its autocorrelation is given by $\\mathbb{E}\\{w[i]w[j]\\} = \\delta[i-j]$. In our case, the argument of the expectation is $\\mathbb{E}\\{w[n-m] w[n-k-l]\\}$, which evaluates to $\\delta[(n-m) - (n-k-l)] = \\delta[l-m+k]$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $r_{x}[k]$:\n$$r_{x}[k] = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\sum_{l=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[m] h[l] \\delta[l-m+k]$$\nThe Kronecker delta $\\delta[l-m+k]$ is non-zero only when $l-m+k=0$, which implies $l=m-k$. We use this property to eliminate the summation over $l$:\n$$r_{x}[k] = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[m] h[m-k]$$\nNow, we substitute the specific impulse response $h[n]=(0.8)^n u[n]$:\n$$r_{x}[k] = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} (0.8)^m u[m] \\, (0.8)^{m-k} u[m-k]$$\nThe product of the unit step functions $u[m]u[m-k]$ is non-zero only for $m \\ge 0$ and $m \\ge k$.

The summation becomes:\n$$r_{x}[k] = \\sum_{m=\\max(0,k)}^{\\infty} (0.8)^{2m-k} = (0.8)^{-k} \\sum_{m=\\max(0,k)}^{\\infty} (0.8^2)^m = (0.8)^{-k} \\sum_{m=\\max(0,k)}^{\\infty} (0.64)^m$$\nWe evaluate this for two cases based on the sign of $k$.\n\nCase 1: $k \\ge 0$. The lower limit is $m=k$.\n$$r_{x}[k] = (0.8)^{-k} \\sum_{m=k}^{\\infty} (0.64)^m$$\nLet $j=m-k$. The sum becomes $\\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} (0.64)^{j+k} = (0.64)^k \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} (0.64)^j$. This is a standard geometric series which converges to $\\frac{1}{1-0.64}$.\n$$r_{x}[k] = (0.8)^{-k} (0.64)^k \\frac{1}{1-0.64} = (0.8)^{-k} (0.8^{2})^k \\frac{1}{0.36} = (0.8)^k \\frac{1}{0.36}$$\nCase 2: $k  0$.

For $k \\ge 0$, $|k|=k$, and for $k0$, $|k|=-k$. The expression is therefore:\n$$r_{x}[k] = \\frac{1}{0.36} (0.8)^{|k|}$$\nUsing exact fractions, $0.8 = \\frac{4}{5}$ and $0.36 = \\frac{9}{25}$.\n$$r_{x}[k] = \\frac{1}{9/25} \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^{|k|} = \\frac{25}{9} \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^{|k|}$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the autocorrelation sequence.\n\nNext, we derive the power spectral density (PSD), $S_{x}(e^{j\\omega})$, which is defined as the DTFT of the autocorrelation sequence $r_{x}[k]$:\n$$S_{x}(e^{j\\omega}) = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} r_{x}[k] e^{-j\\omega k} = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{25}{9} \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^{|k|} e^{-j\\omega k}$$\nWe split the sum into two parts: non-negative $k$ and negative $k$.\n$$S_{x}(e^{j\\omega}) = \\frac{25}{9} \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^{k} e^{-j\\omega k} + \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{-1} \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^{-k} e^{-j\\omega k} \\right)$$\nThe first sum is a geometric series: $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{4}{5} e^{-j\\omega}\\right)^k = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{4}{5}e^{-j\\omega}}$.\nFor the second sum, let $m=-k$.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique, meaningful solution. We will proceed with the derivation as requested.\n\nThe Autoregressive model of order $2$ (AR($2$)) is given by the difference equation:\n$$\nx[n] \\;=\\; a_{1}\\,x[n-1] \\;+\\; a_{2}\\,x[n-2] \\;+\\; w[n]\n$$\nwhere $x[n]$ is the process output, $w[n]$ is a zero-mean white noise process with variance $\\sigma_{w}^{2}$, and $a_{1}, a_{2}$ are real coefficients. The process $x[n]$ is assumed to be zero-mean and wide-sense stationary (WSS). The autocovariance sequence is defined as $\\gamma_{x}[k] \\triangleq \\mathbb{E}\\{x[n]\\,x[n-k]\\}$.\n\nFirst, we derive the difference equation governing $\\gamma_{x}[k]$ for integer lags $k \\geq 1$. We multiply the AR($2$) recursion by $x[n-k]$:\n$$\nx[n]\\,x[n-k] \\;=\\; a_{1}\\,x[n-1]\\,x[n-k] \\;+\\; a_{2}\\,x[n-2]\\,x[n-k] \\;+\\; w[n]\\,x[n-k]\n$$\nNext, we take the expectation of both sides of this equation.

Since the process is WSS, the autocovariance depends only on the time lag.

The AR($2$) process is causal, meaning the output $x[m]$ at any time $m$ depends only on the noise inputs $w[j]$ for $j \\leq m$. Therefore, $x[n-k]$ is a function of the noise samples $\\{w[n-k], w[n-k-1], \\dots\\}$. For $k \\geq 1$, the time indices of all these noise samples are strictly less than $n$. The driving noise $w[n]$ is a white noise process, which means its samples are uncorrelated over time: $\\mathbb{E}\\{w[n]\\,w[m]\\} = \\sigma_{w}^{2}\\,\\delta[n-m]$. This implies that $w[n]$ is uncorrelated with all past noise samples $w[m]$ where $m  n$. Since $x[n-k]$ is a linear combination of such past noise samples (for a stable system), $w[n]$ is also uncorrelated with $x[n-k]$ for $k \\geq 1$. As both $w[n]$ and $x[n]$ are zero-mean processes, their uncorrelation implies that the expectation of their product is zero:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\{w[n]\\,x[n-k]\\} \\;=\\; 0 \\quad \\text{for } k \\geq 1\n$$\nThus, for $k \\geq 1$, the autocovariance sequence $\\gamma_{x}[k]$ obeys the homogeneous linear constant-coefficient difference equation:\n$$\n\\gamma_{x}[k] \\;-\\; a_{1}\\,\\gamma_{x}[k-1] \\;-\\; a_{2}\\,\\gamma_{x}[k-2] \\;=\\; 0\n$$\nThis is a portion of the set of relations known as the Yule-Walker equations.\n\nSecond, we characterize the conditions under which $\\gamma_{x}[k]$ is a damped sinusoid. The behavior of the solution to this homogeneous difference equation is determined by the roots of its characteristic polynomial, $p(z) = z^2 - a_1 z - a_2$. Let the roots be $p_1$ and $p_2$. The general solution for $\\gamma_{x}[k]$ (for $k \\geq 0$) is of the form $C_1 p_1^k + C_2 p_2^k$ (assuming distinct roots). For the solution to be a damped sinusoid, two conditions must be met:\n$1$. The sequence must decay, which requires the magnitude of the roots to be less than $1$, i.e., $|p_1|  1$ and $|p_2|  1$. This ensures $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\gamma_x[k] = 0$.\n$2$. The sequence must oscillate, which requires the roots to be a complex-conjugate pair, as real roots would only produce decaying exponentials.\nTherefore, the roots must take the form $p_{1,2} = r\\exp(\\pm j\\theta)$, where the modulus $r$ satisfies $0  r  1$ for damping, and the angle $\\theta$ satisfies $\\theta \\in (0, \\pi)$ for the roots to be complex and not purely real. With such roots, the autocovariance sequence has the form $\\gamma_x[k] = r^k (A \\cos(k\\theta) + B \\sin(k\\theta))$, which is a damped sinusoid.\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of the autocovariance difference equation is identical to the denominator polynomial of the system's transfer function $H(z)$ written in terms of positive powers of $z$:\n$$\nH(z) = \\frac{X(z)}{W(z)} = \\frac{1}{1 - a_1 z^{-1} - a_2 z^{-2}} = \\frac{z^2}{z^2 - a_1 z - a_2}\n$$\nThe roots of $z^2 - a_1 z - a_2 = 0$ are the poles of the AR($2$) system. Thus, the condition for a damped sinusoidal autocovariance is that the poles of the AR($2$) system must be a complex-conjugate pair located strictly inside the unit circle of the complex $z$-plane. This is also the condition for the stability and WSS nature of the AR($2$) process.\n\nThird, we express the coefficient pair $(a_1, a_2)$ in terms of the polar parameterization of the poles, $p_{1,2} = r\\exp(\\pm j\\theta)$, with $r \\in (0,1)$ and $\\theta \\in (0,\\pi)$. From the characteristic polynomial $z^2 - a_1 z - a_2 = (z-p_1)(z-p_2)$, we use Vieta's formulas, which relate the polynomial coefficients to its roots:\n$$\na_1 = p_1 + p_2\n$$\n$$\n-a_2 = p_1 p_2\n$$\nSubstituting the polar forms of the poles $p_1 = r\\exp(j\\theta)$ and $p_2 = r\\exp(-j\\theta)$:\nFor $a_1$:\n$$\na_1 = r\\exp(j\\theta) + r\\exp(-j\\theta) = r(\\cos\\theta + j\\sin\\theta + \\cos\\theta - j\\sin\\theta) = 2r\\cos\\theta\n$$\nFor $a_2$:\n$$\n-a_2 = (r\\exp(j\\theta)) (r\\exp(-j\\theta)) = r^2 \\exp(j\\theta - j\\theta) = r^2 \\exp(0) = r^2\n$$\nTherefore, $a_2 = -r^2$.\nThe coefficient pair $(a_1, a_2)$ is given by $(2r\\cos\\theta, -r^2)$. The constraints $r \\in (0,1)$ and $\\theta \\in (0,\\pi)$ ensure that the poles form a complex-conjugate pair inside the unit circle, guaranteeing stability and a damped sinusoidal autocovariance function, as required.

A linear time-invariant (LTI) system is stable if and only if its impulse response is absolutely summable. The AR part is an all-pole system with transfer function $H_{AR}(z) = 1/A(z)$. Its behavior is governed by the homogeneous difference equation:\n$$\ny[n] - \\phi_1 y[n-1] - \\phi_2 y[n-2] - \\phi_3 y[n-3] = 0\n$$\nThe general solution to this equation is a linear combination of modes of the form $c_i \\lambda_i^n$, where the $\\lambda_i$ are the roots of the characteristic polynomial associated with $A(z)$. The roots of $A(z) = 1 - \\sum_{k=1}^3 \\phi_k z^{-k} = 0$ are the poles of the system $H(z)$.

The impulse response of the AR part consists of terms proportional to $\\lambda_i^n$. For the process to be wide-sense stationary, the system must be stable, which for a causal system requires the impulse response to decay to zero. This occurs if and only if all roots $\\lambda_i$ of the characteristic polynomial have a magnitude less than $1$.\nCondition for Stationarity: All roots $\\lambda$ of the polynomial $P(z) = z^3 - \\phi_1 z^2 - \\phi_2 z - \\phi_3$ must satisfy $|\\lambda|  1$.\n\nThe **invertibility** of the model refers to the ability to uniquely determine the input noise sequence $e[n]$ from the output sequence $x[n]$ using a stable and causal filter. The relationship is $E(z) = H(z)^{-1} X(z) = \\frac{A(z)}{B(z)} X(z)$. The inverse system has poles at the zeros of the original system. The zeros of $H(z)$ are the roots of the numerator polynomial $B(z) = 1 + \\theta_1 z^{-1} + \\theta_2 z^{-2} = 0$. Multiplying by $z^2$ gives $Q(z) = z^2 + \\theta_1 z + \\theta_2 = 0$. Let the roots of $Q(z)$ be $z_{0,k}$. For the inverse system to be stable and causal, its poles must lie inside the unit circle. Therefore, the zeros $z_{0,k}$ of the moving-average (MA) part must lie inside the unit circle. Such a system is also called minimum-phase.\nCondition for Invertibility: All roots $z_0$ of the polynomial $Q(z) = z^2 + \\theta_1 z + \\theta_2$ must satisfy $|z_0|  1$.\n\nPart 2: Checking the Conditions\n\nFor the AR part (stationarity), we examine the roots of $P(z) = z^3 - \\phi_1 z^2 - \\phi_2 z - \\phi_3 = 0$ with the given parameters $\\phi_1 = 1.7$, $\\phi_2 = -0.06$, $\\phi_3 = -0.36$:\n$$\nP(z) = z^3 - 1.7 z^2 + 0.06 z + 0.36 = 0\n$$\nBy inspection, one can test for rational roots. For $z=1.5$:\n$P(1.5) = (1.5)^3 - 1.7(1.5)^2 + 0.06(1.5) + 0.36 = 3.375 - 1.7(2.25) + 0.09 + 0.36 = 3.375 - 3.825 + 0.45 = 0$.\nSo, $\\lambda_1 = 1.5$ is a root. We perform polynomial division of $P(z)$ by $(z-1.5)$ to find the remaining roots:\n$$\n\\frac{z^3 - 1.7 z^2 + 0.06 z + 0.36}{z - 1.5} = z^2 - 0.2 z - 0.24\n$$\nThe roots of $z^2 - 0.2 z - 0.24 = 0$ are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{0.2 \\pm \\sqrt{(-0.2)^2 - 4(1)(-0.24)}}{2} = \\frac{0.2 \\pm \\sqrt{0.04 + 0.96}}{2} = \\frac{0.2 \\pm 1}{2}\n$$\nThis gives $\\lambda_2 = 1.2/2 = 0.6$ and $\\lambda_3 = -0.8/2 = -0.4$. The roots of the AR characteristic polynomial are $\\lambda_1 = 1.5$, $\\lambda_2 = 0.6$, and $\\lambda_3 = -0.4$. Since $|\\lambda_1| = 1.5  1$, the stationarity condition is violated.\n\nFor the MA part (invertibility), we examine the roots of $Q(z) = z^2 + \\theta_1 z + \\theta_2 = 0$ with $\\theta_1 = -1.9$, $\\theta_2 = 0.84$:\n$$\nQ(z) = z^2 - 1.9 z + 0.84 = 0\n$$\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n$$\nz_0 = \\frac{1.9 \\pm \\sqrt{(-1.9)^2 - 4(1)(0.84)}}{2} = \\frac{1.9 \\pm \\sqrt{3.61 - 3.36}}{2} = \\frac{1.9 \\pm \\sqrt{0.25}}{2} = \\frac{1.9 \\pm 0.5}{2}\n$$\nThis gives the zeros $z_{0,1} = 2.4/2 = 1.2$ and $z_{0,2} = 1.4/2 = 0.7$. Since $|z_{0,1}| = 1.2  1$, the invertibility condition is violated.\n\nPart 3: Correcting the Parameters\n\nWe must reflect the violating roots/zeros across the unit circle.\nFor the AR part, the violating root is $\\lambda_1 = 1.5$. The reflected root is $\\lambda'_1 = 1/1.5 = 2/3$. The other roots, $\\lambda_2 = 0.6 = 3/5$ and $\\lambda_3 = -0.4 = -2/5$, are already inside the unit circle. The new set of stable roots is $\\{\\lambda'_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3\\} = \\{2/3, 3/5, -2/5\\}$.\nWe reconstruct the normalized (monic) polynomial $P'(z) = z^3 - \\phi'_1 z^2 - \\phi'_2 z - \\phi'_3$ from these roots:\n$P'(z) = (z - 2/3)(z - 3/5)(z + 2/5)$.\nUsing Vieta's formulas for $P'(z)=0$:\nSum of roots: $\\phi'_1 = \\lambda'_1 + \\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3 = \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{3}{5} - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{10+3}{15} = \\frac{13}{15}$.\nSum of products of roots taken two at a time: $-\\phi'_2 = (\\frac{2}{3})(\\frac{3}{5}) + (\\frac{2}{3})(-\\frac{2}{5}) + (\\frac{3}{5})(-\\frac{2}{5}) = \\frac{6}{15} - \\frac{4}{15} - \\frac{6}{25} = \\frac{2}{15} - \\frac{6}{25} = \\frac{10-18}{75} = -\\frac{8}{75}$. Thus, $\\phi'_2 = \\frac{8}{75}$.\nProduct of roots: $\\phi'_3 = (\\frac{2}{3})(\\frac{3}{5})(-\\frac{2}{5}) = -\\frac{12}{75} = -\\frac{4}{25}$.\nThe corrected AR parameters are $\\phi'_1 = 13/15$, $\\phi'_2 = 8/75$, $\\phi'_3 = -4/25$.\n\nFor the MA part, the violating zero is $z_{0,1} = 1.2$. The reflected zero is $z'_{0,1} = 1/1.2 = 1/(6/5) = 5/6$. The other zero, $z_{0,2} = 0.7 = 7/10$, is already inside the unit circle. The new set of minimum-phase zeros is $\\{z'_{0,1}, z_{0,2}\\} = \\{5/6, 7/10\\}$.\nWe reconstruct the normalized (monic) polynomial $Q'(z) = z^2 + \\theta'_1 z + \\theta'_2$ from these zeros:\n$Q'(z) = (z - 5/6)(z - 7/10)$.\nUsing Vieta's formulas for $Q'(z)=0$:\nSum of roots: $-\\theta'_1 = \\frac{5}{6} + \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{25+21}{30} = \\frac{46}{30} = \\frac{23}{15}$. Thus, $\\theta'_1 = -\\frac{23}{15}$.\nProduct of roots: $\\theta'_2 = (\\frac{5}{6})(\\frac{7}{10}) = \\frac{35}{60} = \\frac{7}{12}$.\nThe corrected MA parameters are $\\theta'_1 = -23/15$, $\\theta'_2 = 7/12$.\n\nThe final corrected parameter vector $(\\phi'_1, \\phi'_2, \\phi'_3, \\theta'_1, \\theta'_2)$ is $(\\frac{13}{15}, \\frac{8}{75}, -\\frac{4}{25}, -\\frac{23}{15}, \\frac{7}{12})$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{13}{15}  \\frac{8}{75}  -\\frac{4}{25}  -\\frac{23}{15}  \\frac{7}{12} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2885736"}]}
