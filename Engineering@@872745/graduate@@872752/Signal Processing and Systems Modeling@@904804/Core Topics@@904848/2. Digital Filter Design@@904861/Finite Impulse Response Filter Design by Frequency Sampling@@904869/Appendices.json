The design process begins by specifying the filter's $N$-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), $H[k]$, at discrete frequencies $\\omega_k = 2\\pi k/N$, and then obtaining the impulse response $h[n]$ via the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT).\n\nThe fundamental principle for ensuring the impulse response $h[n]$ is real-valued is that its DFT, $H[k]$, must exhibit conjugate symmetry. This property is expressed as:\n$$\nH[k] = H^*[(N-k) \\pmod N] \\quad \\text{for } k = 0, 1, \\dots, N-1\n$$\nwhere the asterisk ($*$) denotes the complex conjugate.\n\nThe problem specifies a target linear phase response corresponding to a group delay of $\\tau=7.5$ samples. For a filter of length $N=16$, this group delay is equal to $(N-1)/2 = (16-1)/2 = 7.5$. An impulse response with this group delay is symmetric, $h[n] = h[N-1-n]$. A filter with even length $N$ and a symmetric impulse response is classified as a Type II linear-phase FIR filter. A critical property of any Type II filter is that its frequency response must be zero at the Nyquist frequency, $\\omega = \\pi$. In the context of an $N$-point DFT, this corresponds to the frequency bin $k=N/2$. Therefore, we must have $H[N/2] = 0$.\n\nWe are given the magnitude samples $\\lvert H_d(e^{j \\omega_k})\\rvert$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, N/2$. The construction of the full $N$-point DFT sequence $H[k]$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, 15$ proceeds by enforcing the aforementioned constraints.\n\n1.  **Self-Conjugate Bins ($k=0$ and $k=N/2$):**\n    The conjugate symmetry condition implies that the bins at $k=0$ (DC frequency) and $k=N/2$ (Nyquist frequency, for even $N$) must be real-valued, since $H[0] = H^*[0]$ and $H[N/2] = H^*[N-N/2]=H^*[N/2]$.\n    -   For the DC bin, $k=0$, the problem specifies $H[0] = \\lvert H_d(e^{j \\omega_0})\\rvert$. As the magnitude is a real number, this correctly sets $H[0]$ to a real value.\n    -   For the Nyquist bin, $k=N/2=8$, the problem gives the rule $H[8] = \\lvert H_d(e^{j \\omega_8})\\rvert \\, \\cos(\\pi \\tau)$. With the specified group delay $\\tau = 7.5$, we evaluate the cosine term: $\\cos(\\pi \\times 7.5) = \\cos(7.5\\pi) = 0$. This forces $H[8]=0$, which precisely satisfies the necessary condition for a Type II linear-phase filter, regardless of the input magnitude at that frequency.\n\n2.  **Lower-Half Frequency Bins ($k=1, 2, \\dots, N/2-1$):**\n    For the bins $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 7\\}$, the complex frequency response samples are synthesized by combining the given magnitudes with the target linear phase:\n    $$\n    H[k] = \\lvert H_d(e^{j \\omega_k})\\rvert \\, e^{-j \\omega_k \\tau}\n    $$\n    Substituting $\\omega_k = 2\\pi k/N = \\pi k/8$ and $\\tau=7.5$, we have:\n    $$\n    H[k] = \\lvert H_d(e^{j \\pi k/8})\\rvert \\, e^{-j (\\pi k/8)(7.5)} = \\lvert H_d(e^{j \\pi k/8})\\rvert \\, e^{-j 7.5\\pi k/8}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Upper-Half Frequency Bins ($k=N/2+1, \\dots, N-1$):**\n    To satisfy the conjugate symmetry requirement, the remaining frequency samples for $k \\in \\{9, 10, \\dots, 15\\}$ are determined from the lower-half bins. The symmetry relation $H[k] = H^*[N-k]$ is applied for $k=9, \\dots, 15$, which is equivalent to setting:\n    $$\n    H[N-k] = H^*[k] \\quad \\text{for } k = 1, 2, \\dots, 7\n    $$\n    For instance, $H[15] = H^*[1]$, $H[14]=H^*[2]$, and so on.\n\nOnce the complete DFT sequence $H[k]$ for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, 15$ has been constructed according to these rules, the final real-valued impulse response $h[n]$ is computed using the $N$-point Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT):\n$$\nh[n] = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} H[k] e^{j 2\\pi kn/N} = \\frac{1}{16} \\sum_{k=0}^{15} H[k] e^{j \\pi kn/8}\n$$\nBecause $H[k]$ has been built with perfect conjugate symmetry, the resulting sequence $h[n]$ is guaranteed to be real-valued, and due to the choice of $\\tau$, it will also be symmetric, i.e., $h[n] = h[15-n]$.
