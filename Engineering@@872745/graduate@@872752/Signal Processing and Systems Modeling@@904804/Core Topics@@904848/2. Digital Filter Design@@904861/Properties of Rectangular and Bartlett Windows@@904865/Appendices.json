The model of quantization error is a standard one. The problem is well-posed, asking for a conceptual evaluation of statements based on a clearly defined physical and mathematical model. The language is objective and precise. The premise \"independent quantization\" is key; it implies that the quantization of $w_b[n]$ and $w_b[N-1-n]$ are separate events. Even if the ideal values are identical, their numerical computation in a real processor might yield infinitesimally different floating-point results before quantization, which can cause them to round to different fixed-point values. The problem is thus not only valid but poses a realistic and practical question about DSP implementation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nA fundamental property of the DTFT is that a real-valued sequence $x[n]$ of length $N$ has a purely linear phase if and only if it possesses symmetry about its midpoint $(N-1)/2$. Specifically, if $x[n] = x[N-1-n]$ for all $n$, its DTFT can be written as $X(\\omega) = A(\\omega)e^{-j\\omega(N-1)/2}$, where $A(\\omega)$ is a real-valued function representing the amplitude. The phase is $\\phi(\\omega) = -\\omega(N-1)/2$.\n\nAny real sequence $\\tilde{w}_b[n]$ can be decomposed into a symmetric component $w_e[n]$ and an antisymmetric component $w_o[n]$ relative to the midpoint $(N-1)/2$:\n$$w_e[n] = \\frac{1}{2}(\\tilde{w}_b[n] + \\tilde{w}_b[N-1-n])$$\n$$w_o[n] = \\frac{1}{2}(\\tilde{w}_b[n] - \\tilde{w}_b[N-1-n])$$\nSo, $\\tilde{w}_b[n] = w_e[n] + w_o[n]$.\n\nThe DTFT of the symmetric component is $W_e(\\omega) = A_e(\\omega)\ne^{-j\\omega(N-1)/2}$, where $A_e(\\omega)$ is real.\nThe DTFT of the real, antisymmetric component is $W_o(\\omega) = jB_o(\\omega) e^{-j\\omega(N-1)/2}$, where $B_o(\\omega)$ is real.\n\nThe total DTFT is the sum:\n$$\\tilde{W}_b(\\omega) = W_e(\\omega) + W_o(\\omega) = (A_e(\\omega) + jB_o(\\omega))e^{-j\\omega(N-1)/2}$$\nThe term $e^{-j\\omega(N-1)/2}$ is the expected linear phase term from the ideal symmetric window. The term $(A_e(\\omega) + jB_o(\\omega))$ is the complex amplitude. Any deviation from a real-valued amplitude is a source of phase error. The phase of this complex amplitude represents the phase error, $\\phi_{err}(\\omega)$:\n$$\\phi_{err}(\\omega) = \\arg\\{A_e(\\omega) + jB_o(\\omega)\\} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{B_o(\\omega)}{A_e(\\omega)}\\right)$$\nFor small errors, $B_o(\\omega)$ is small, and the small-angle approximation $\\arctan(x) \\approx x$ can be used:\n$$\\phi_{err}(\\omega) \\approx \\frac{B_o(\\omega)}{A_e(\\omega)}$$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Independent quantization generally prevents exact equality $\\tilde{w}_b[n]=\\tilde{w}_b[N-1-n]$ for all mirror pairs when $N$ is even, which introduces a small antisymmetric component. In the frequency domain, after factoring out the nominal linear-phase term $e^{-j \\omega (N-1)/2}$, this antisymmetric component contributes a small imaginary part; for small asymmetry, the phase error is approximately the ratio of the imaginary part to the real part.**\n\nThis statement is correct.\n1.  **Symmetry Breaking**: While the ideal values $w_b[n]$ and $w_b[N-1-n]$ are equal, their actual computation in a digital system might involve different sequences of operations, potentially leading to minute numerical differences before the final rounding step. If one pre-quantized value falls just below a rounding boundary (e.g., $k\\Delta + \\Delta/2$) and its symmetric counterpart falls just above, the \"independent quantization\" will yield different results, i.e., $\\tilde{w}_b[n] \\neq \\tilde{w}_b[N-1-n]$.\n2.  **Antisymmetric Component**: This inequality means the antisymmetric part $w_o[n] = \\frac{1}{2}(\\tilde{w}_b[n] - \\tilde{w}_b[N-1-n])$ is non-zero. Since the ideal window was symmetric, this antisymmetric component arises solely from quantization errors: $w_o[n] = \\frac{1}{2}(e[n] - e[N-1-n])$.\n3.  **Frequency Domain Effect**: As derived above, the DTFT of $w_o[n]$ contributes a term $jB_o(\\omega)e^{-j\\omega(N-1)/2}$. After factoring out the linear phase term $e^{-j\\omega(N-1)/2}$, the remaining complex amplitude is $A_e(\\omega) + jB_o(\\omega)$. The antisymmetric component gives rise to the imaginary part $B_o(\\omega)$.\n4.  **Phase Error Approximation**: As shown in the derivation, the phase error is $\\phi_{err}(\\omega) = \\arctan(B_o(\\omega)/A_e(\\omega))$, which for small errors is well approximated by the ratio of the imaginary part ($B_o(\\omega)$) to the real part ($A_e(\\omega)$) of the complex amplitude.\nThe statement is a complete and accurate description of the phenomenon.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Because $w_b[n]$ is piecewise linear, quantization cannot destroy exact symmetry for even $N$, so $\\tilde{W}_b(\\omega)$ retains exact linear phase regardless of rounding.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The piecewise linearity of the ideal, continuous-domain function does not guarantee that symmetry is preserved after generation and quantization in a digital system. As explained for option A, the process of calculating the window samples, which often involves floating-point or fixed-point arithmetic with finite precision, can introduce tiny discrepancies between ideally symmetric points. These minuscule differences can be enough to cause different outcomes upon rounding. Therefore, one cannot claim that symmetry is immune to destruction by quantization. The premise is flawed, and consequently, the conclusion that the DTFT retains exact linear phase is also incorrect in the general case described.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The relative phase error is largest near frequencies where $\\lvert W_b(\\omega) \\rvert$ has deep nulls, because the denominator in the small-angle approximation becomes small; thus even tiny antisymmetries can cause large phase swings there, despite having small absolute magnitude.**\n\nThis statement is correct. The phase error is approximated by $\\phi_{err}(\\omega) \\approx B_o(\\omega)/A_e(\\omega)$.\n- The denominator $A_e(\\omega)$ is the amplitude of the symmetric component of the quantized window. This component is very close to the ideal window $w_b[n]$, so its amplitude spectrum $A_e(\\omega)$ is very close to the ideal amplitude spectrum of $W_b(\\omega)$. The spectral nulls of the Bartlett window are frequencies where $|W_b(\\omega)|$ becomes zero. At or near these nulls, the denominator $A_e(\\omega)$ will be very small.\n- The numerator $B_o(\\omega)$ is the amplitude of the DTFT of the small antisymmetric error component. There is no reason for $B_o(\\omega)$ to be zero at the exact same frequencies where $A_e(\\omega)$ is zero.\n- As a result, the ratio $B_o(\\omega)/A_e(\\omega)$ can become very large as the denominator approaches zero, leading to a large phase error. This can manifest as a rapid phase transition near the nulls, where the phase might swing by as much as $\\pi$ radians as the denominator $A_e(\\omega)$ passes through zero.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. If one enforces symmetry by rounding only the first half and then copying the quantized values to the second half, the phase of $\\tilde{W}_b(\\omega)$ becomes identically zero for even $N$ at all frequencies because the sequence is symmetric.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The described procedure does enforce perfect symmetry, i.e., $\\tilde{w}_b[n] = \\tilde{w}_b[N-1-n]$. As established, a real sequence with this symmetry property has a DTFT of the form $\\tilde{W}_b(\\omega) = A(\\omega)e^{-j\\omega(N-1)/2}$, where $A(\\omega)$ is real. The phase of this DTFT is $\\phi(\\omega) = -\\omega(N-1)/2$. This is a linear function of frequency $\\omega$. It is not identically zero for all $\\omega$. The phase is zero only at $\\omega=0$. A zero-phase signal would require symmetry about the origin $n=0$ (i.e., $\\tilde{w}_b[n] = \\tilde{w}_b[-n]$), which is not the type of symmetry being discussed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. For the rectangular window $w_r[n]$ with constant samples, uniform quantization produces identical values at all indices, so symmetry is preserved exactly and no phase error arises from quantization.**\n\nThis statement is correct. The ideal rectangular window is $w_r[n] = C$ for some constant $C$ over the interval $n \\in \\{0, \\dots, N-1\\}$. When each sample is quantized, the input to the quantizer is the same value $C$ for all $n$. Since quantization $Q(\\cdot)$ is a deterministic function, the output must also be the same for all $n$: $\\tilde{w}_r[n] = Q(C)$. The resulting quantized sequence is also a constant. A constant sequence is trivially symmetric about the midpoint $(N-1)/2$ because $\\tilde{w}_r[n] = \\tilde{w}_r[N-1-n]$ for all $n$. As such, its DTFT will have a perfectly linear phase, and no *additional* phase error is introduced by the quantization process.\n**Verdict: Correct**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "2895488"}]}
