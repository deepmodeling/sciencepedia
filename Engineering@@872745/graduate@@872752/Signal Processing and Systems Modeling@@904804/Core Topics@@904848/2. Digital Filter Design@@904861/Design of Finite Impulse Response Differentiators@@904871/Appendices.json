It concerns fundamental properties of Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems, specifically Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters, a core topic in signal processing. The problem is formalizable and requires a rigorous derivation from first principles. Therefore, it is valid and we proceed with the solution.\n\nLet the system be an LTI system characterized by its finite-length impulse response $\\{h[n]\\}_{n=0}^{N-1}$, where $h[n] \\in \\mathbb{R}$ for all $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, N-1\\}$. The output $y[n]$ of this system for an input $x[n]$ is given by the discrete-time convolution sum:\n$$y[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[k] x[n-k]$$\nGiven that the impulse response is of finite length $N$, it is non-zero only for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, N-1\\}$. The convolution sum simplifies to:\n$$y[n] = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} h[k] x[n-k]$$\nThe input is specified as a constant sequence, $x[n] = C$ for all integers $n$, where $C \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is an arbitrary, fixed constant. Substituting this into the convolution equation, we have $x[n-k] = C$ for any value of $n$ and $k$. This yields:\n$$y[n] = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} h[k] C$$\nSince the constant $C$ does not depend on the summation index $k$, it can be factored out of the sum:\n$$y[n] = C \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} h[k] \\right)$$\nThe problem requires the output $y[n]$ to be identically zero for all $n$. This means $y[n] = 0$. The equation becomes:\n$$C \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} h[k] \\right) = 0$$\nThis equation must hold for any arbitrary choice of the constant $C$. If we choose any $C \\neq 0$, the only way for the product to be zero is if the other term is zero. Therefore, the condition that must be satisfied by the impulse response coefficients is:\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} h[k] = 0$$\n\nWe must establish the necessity and sufficiency of this condition.\nSufficiency: Assume that $\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} h[k] = 0$. Then, for any input $x[n] = C$, the output is $y[n] = C \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} h[k] \\right) = C \\cdot 0 = 0$ for all $n$. Thus, the condition is sufficient to guarantee zero output for any constant input.\nNecessity: Assume that for any constant input $x[n] = C$, the output $y[n]$ is identically zero. This implies that the relation $C \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} h[k] \\right) = 0$ must hold for any $C \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Let us choose a specific non-zero constant, for example $C=1$. For this case, the equation becomes $1 \\cdot \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} h[k] \\right) = 0$, which directly implies $\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} h[k] = 0$. Thus, the condition is necessary.\n\nNow, we relate this condition to the Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT). The DTFT of the impulse response $h[n]$ defines the system's frequency response, $H(\\exp(j\\omega)) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} h[n] \\exp(-j\\omega n)$. Complex exponentials of the form $\\exp(j\\omega n)$ are eigenfunctions of LTI systems. For an input $x[n] = A \\exp(j\\omega_{0} n)$, the output is $y[n] = A H(\\exp(j\\omega_{0})) \\exp(j\\omega_{0} n)$.\nThe constant input $x[n] = C$ can be viewed as a complex exponential with zero frequency ($\\omega=0$) and amplitude $C$, i.e., $x[n] = C \\cdot \\exp(j \\cdot 0 \\cdot n)$. Based on the eigenfunction property, the output is:\n$$y[n] = C \\cdot H(\\exp(j \\cdot 0)) \\cdot \\exp(j \\cdot 0 \\cdot n) = C \\cdot H(\\exp(j0))$$\nThe term $H(\\exp(j0))$ is the system's frequency response evaluated at $\\omega=0$, which is the DC gain. From the DTFT definition:\n$$H(\\exp(j0)) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} h[n] \\exp(-j \\cdot 0 \\cdot n) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} h[n] \\cdot 1 = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} h[n]$$\nTherefore, the output is $y[n] = C \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} h[n]$, which is identical to the result obtained from direct convolution. The condition for $y[n]$ to be identically zero for any $C \\neq 0$ is that the DC gain must be zero: $H(\\exp(j0)) = 0$, which is precisely the condition $\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} h[n] = 0$. An ideal differentiator must have a frequency response proportional to $j\\omega$, which is zero at $\\omega=0$. Our derived condition enforces this requirement for a practical FIR differentiator.\n\nFinally, we must verify this condition for an FIR filter with antisymmetric coefficients, i.e., $h[n] = -h[N-1-n]$ for $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, N-1\\}$. We must evaluate the sum $S = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} h[n]$ and show it is zero. We consider two cases for the filter length $N$.\n\nCase 1: $N$ is even. Let $N=2M$ for some integer $M \\ge 1$. The sum is $S = \\sum_{n=0}^{2M-1} h[n]$. We can partition the sum into two halves:\n$$S = \\sum_{n=0}^{M-1} h[n] + \\sum_{n=M}^{2M-1} h[n]$$\nUsing the antisymmetry property $h[n] = -h[N-1-n] = -h[2M-1-n]$, we rewrite the second summation:\n$$\\sum_{n=M}^{2M-1} h[n] = \\sum_{n=M}^{2M-1} (-h[2M-1-n])$$\nLet's perform a change of index $k = 2M-1-n$. As $n$ ranges from $M$ to $2M-1$, the index $k$ ranges from $M-1$ down to $0$. The summation becomes:\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} (-h[k]) = -\\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} h[k]$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $S$:\n$$S = \\left(\\sum_{n=0}^{M-1} h[n]\\right) + \\left(-\\sum_{n=0}^{M-1} h[n]\\right) = 0$$\nThe condition is satisfied for any even length $N$.\n\nCase 2: $N$ is odd. Let $N=2M+1$ for some integer $M \\ge 0$. The summation index $n$ runs from $0$ to $2M$. The center of symmetry is at $n=M$. Let us first examine the value of the central coefficient, $h[M]$. Using the antisymmetry condition $h[n] = -h[N-1-n]$ at $n=M$:\n$$h[M] = -h[(2M+1)-1-M] = -h[M]$$\nThis implies $2h[M] = 0$, which means $h[M]=0$. The central tap of an odd-length antisymmetric FIR filter must be zero. Now we evaluate the sum $S = \\sum_{n=0}^{2M} h[n]$:\n$$S = \\left(\\sum_{n=0}^{M-1} h[n]\\right) + h[M] + \\left(\\sum_{n=M+1}^{2M} h[n]\\right)$$\nSince $h[M]=0$, this simplifies to:\n$$S = \\sum_{n=0}^{M-1} h[n] + \\sum_{n=M+1}^{2M} h[n]$$\nApplying the antisymmetry property $h[n] = -h[N-1-n] = -h[2M-n]$ to the second sum:\n$$\\sum_{n=M+1}^{2M} h[n] = \\sum_{n=M+1}^{2M} (-h[2M-n])$$\nLet's perform a change of index $k=2M-n$. As $n$ ranges from $M+1$ to $2M$, the index $k$ ranges from $M-1$ down to $0$. The summation becomes:\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} (-h[k]) = -\\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} h[k]$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $S$:\n$$S = \\left(\\sum_{n=0}^{M-1} h[n]\\right) + \\left(-\\sum_{n=0}^{M-1} h[n]\\right) = 0$$\nThe condition is also satisfied for any odd length $N$.\n\nIn both cases, even and odd $N$, the antisymmetry property robustly guarantees that the sum of the impulse response coefficients is zero. Therefore, any FIR filter with antisymmetric coefficients will produce a zero output for a constant input.

This behavior is mathematically specified by the condition $\\lim_{\\omega \\to 0} \\frac{H(\\omega)}{\\omega} = \\frac{j}{T_{s}}$.\n\nWe begin with the definition of the Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) of the impulse response $h[n]$:\n$$H(\\omega) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[n] \\exp(-j \\omega n)$$\nThe problem requires using the Taylor series expansion of the complex exponential term, $\\exp(-j \\omega n)$, around the point $\\omega = 0$.

It requires the derivation and implementation of an algorithmic procedure to provide an initial estimate for the filter length, $N$, based on standard frequency-domain specifications. The problem is scientifically grounded in established principles of digital signal processing and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We shall proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe objective is to design a real-coefficient, linear-phase, antisymmetric FIR differentiator. The ideal frequency response of such a differentiator is $H_d(\\omega) = j\\omega$, where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency in radians per sample. The magnitude response is $|H_d(\\omega)| = \\omega$, and the phase is a constant $\\pi/2$. The impulse response corresponding to this ideal is non-causal and of infinite duration, given by $h_d(n) = \\frac{\\cos(\\pi n)}{n}$ for $n \\neq 0$ and $h_d(0) = 0$.\n\nA practical FIR filter must have a finite length, $N$. To preserve linear phase and approximate the ideal differentiator's antisymmetry, the impulse response $h(n)$ must satisfy $h(n) = -h(N-1-n)$ for $n \\in [0, N-1]$. This constraint implies that for the center tap, $h((N-1)/2) = 0$. This is naturally satisfied if $N$ is an odd integer (a Type III filter), as the impulse response is defined only at integer indices. The problem correctly mandates an odd length for this reason.\n\nThe design of an FIR filter from frequency-domain specifications involves a trade-off between the filter length $N$, the sharpness of the transition between bands (transition width), and the accuracy of the approximation within the specified bands (ripple). Well-established empirical formulas, derived from extensive studies of window-based and optimal equiripple design methods, quantify this relationship. Our task is to adapt these general principles to the specific constraints of the given differentiator problem.\n\nThe specifications provided are:\n$1$. A passband relative error bound:\n$$ \\max_{\\omega \\in [\\omega_\\ell,\\omega_p]} \\frac{| H(\\omega) - j\\omega |}{\\omega} \\le \\delta_p $$\n$2$. A stopband magnitude bound:\n$$ \\max_{\\omega \\in [\\omega_s,\\pi]} | H(\\omega) | \\le \\delta_s $$\n\nLet us analyze these constraints to extract the parameters required for a length estimation formula. The fundamental parameters are the transition width, $\\Delta\\omega$, and a single, controlling ripple value, $\\delta$.\n\nThe transition band lies between the passband edge $\\omega_p$ and the stopband edge $\\omega_s$. The width of this band is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta\\omega = \\omega_s - \\omega_p $$\nA smaller $\\Delta\\omega$ signifies a sharper transition and necessitates a longer filter.\n\nNext, we must unify the two ripple specifications into a single controlling parameter. The stopband constraint gives an absolute ripple magnitude, $\\delta_s$. The passband constraint is a relative error. We convert it to an equivalent absolute error constraint:\n$$ | H(\\omega) - j\\omega | \\le \\delta_p \\omega, \\quad \\text{for } \\omega \\in [\\omega_\\ell, \\omega_p] $$\nThis establishes an absolute error bound that varies linearly with frequency. For the purpose of estimating the overall required filter length, it is conventional to consider the point of maximum absolute deviation within the passband, which occurs at the upper band edge, $\\omega_p$. The effective absolute passband ripple, $\\delta'_p$, is thus defined as:\n$$ \\delta'_p = \\delta_p \\omega_p $$\nThe filter design must satisfy both the effective passband constraint $\\delta'_p$ and the stopband constraint $\\delta_s$. An optimal design method, such as the Parks-McClellan algorithm, will be limited by whichever of these two constraints is more stringent. Therefore, we define the controlling ripple $\\delta$ as the minimum of these two values:\n$$ \\delta = \\min(\\delta'_p, \\delta_s) = \\min(\\delta_p \\omega_p, \\delta_s) $$\n\nFrom this controlling ripple $\\delta$, we compute the required minimum attenuation, $A_s$, in decibels ($dB$):\n$$ A_s = -20 \\log_{10}(\\delta) $$\nThe attenuation $A_s$ and the transition width $\\Delta\\omega$ are the two key parameters that determine the filter length.\n\nNumerous empirical formulas exist to estimate FIR filter length. We select the widely cited formula by Kaiser, which provides a reliable initial estimate for filters designed using both windowing and optimal methods. It robustly links filter length to attenuation and transition width:\n$$ N_0 \\approx \\frac{A_s - C_1}{C_2 \\Delta\\omega} $$\nThe constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are derived empirically. A common and well-validated form of this formula is:\n$$ N_0 = \\frac{A_s - 8}{2.285 \\Delta\\omega} $$\nHere, $N_0$ is the real-valued initial length estimate. This formula is derived from the properties of the Kaiser window, which itself is an approximation to the discrete prolate spheroidal sequence, the optimal solution to the time-frequency concentration problem. It serves as an excellent, principled starting point for length estimation.\n\nFinally, we must enforce the structural requirement that the filter be of Type III, meaning its length $N$ must be a positive odd integer. The derived estimate $N_0$ is a real number. The required length $N$ is the smallest odd integer that is greater than or equal to $N_0$. This is determined by the following procedure:\n$1$. Calculate the ceiling of $N_0$: $N_{ceil} = \\lceil N_0 \\rceil$.\n$2$. If $N_{ceil}$ is odd, the final length is $N = N_{ceil}$.\n$3. $If $N_{ceil}$ is even, the final length is $N = N_{ceil} + 1$.\n\nIn summary, the complete algorithmic procedure is as follows:\n$1$.
