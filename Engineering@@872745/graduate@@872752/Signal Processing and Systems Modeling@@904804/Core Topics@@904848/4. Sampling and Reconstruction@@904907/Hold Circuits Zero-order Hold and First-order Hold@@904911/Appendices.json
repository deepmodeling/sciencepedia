The ZOH model's response depends only on the input value at the beginning of the sampling interval, $u_k$. The FOH model's response depends on the average of the input values at the beginning and end of the interval, $\\frac{u_k+u_{k+1}}{2}$. This is intuitively correct: ZOH assumes a constant input $u_k$ over $[t_k, t_{k+1}]$, while FOH assumes a linear interpolation between $u_k$ and $u_{k+1}$, for which the average value over the interval is indeed their mean. The FOH, by accounting for the input's variation within the interval, provides a more accurate representation for time-varying inputs.\n\nThe final results for the matrix expansions are listed below.\n$A_d^{(1)} = I + AT$\n$A_d^{(2)} = I + AT + \\frac{1}{2}A^2T^2$\n$B_d^{(1)} = BT$\n$B_d^{(2)} = BT + \\frac{1}{2}ABT^2$\n$B_0^{(1)} = \\frac{1}{2}BT$\n$B_0^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{2}BT + \\frac{1}{3}ABT^2$\n$B_1^{(1)} = \\frac{1}{2}BT$\n$B_1^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{2}BT + \\frac{1}{6}ABT^2$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nI + AT  I + AT + \\frac{1}{2}A^2T^2  BT  BT + \\frac{1}{2}ABT^2  \\frac{1}{2}BT  \\frac{1}{2}BT + \\frac{1}{3}ABT^2  \\frac{1}{2}BT  \\frac{1}{2}BT + \\frac{1}{6}ABT^2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2876375"}, {"introduction": "While state-space models describe system evolution, a frequency-domain perspective is essential for understanding how a hold circuit shapes the reconstructed signal's spectrum.

I will proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe problem concerns the zeros of a sampled-data system. For a continuous-time system of order $n$ with $m$ finite zeros, the corresponding discrete-time system, obtained through sampling and a hold device, is of order $n$ and possesses, in general, $n-1$ finite zeros. Of these $n-1$ zeros, $m$ are approximately mapped from the continuous-time zeros via the relation $z \\approx e^{s_i T}$. The remaining $(n-1) - m = n-m-1 = r-1$ zeros are artifacts of the sampling and hold process itself. These are known as \"sampling zeros.\" The location of these sampling zeros is critically dependent on the relative degree $r$ and the type of hold circuit used.\n\nIn this problem, the plant order is $n=4$ and it has $m=1$ finite zero at $s=b$. The relative degree is $r=n-m=3$. Therefore, the discrete-time system will have $n-1=3$ zeros. One of these will be the mapped zero corresponding to $s=b$, located at $z_b \\approx e^{bT}$. Since $b>0$ and $T>0$, this zero is always outside the unit circle ($z_b > 1$). The other $r-1=2$ zeros are sampling zeros. We must analyze their location as $T \\to 0^+$ for both ZOH and FOH.\n\n**1. Zero-Order Hold (ZOH) Analysis**\n\nUnder ZOH, the input $u(t)$ is piecewise constant, $u(t)=u_k$ for $t \\in [kT, (k+1)T)$. The discrete-time system is given by:\n$$\nx_{k+1} = \\Phi(T) x_k + \\Gamma_0(T) u_k, \\qquad y_k = C x_k\n$$\nThe transfer function is $G_{d,ZOH}(z) = C(zI - \\Phi(T))^{-1}\\Gamma_0(T)$. The zeros of this system are the roots of the numerator polynomial. It is a cornerstone result of sampled-data theory that for a system with relative degree $r$, the sampling zeros asymptotically approach the roots of the Euler-Frobenius polynomial $B_{r-1}(z)$. For this problem, $r=3$, so we are interested in the polynomial $B_2(z)$:\n$$\nB_2(z) = z^2 + 4z + 1\n$$\nThe roots of $B_2(z)=0$ are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$\nz = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{4^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{12}}{2} = -2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}\n$$\nThe limiting locations of the two sampling zeros are:\n$$\nz_1 = -2 - \\sqrt{3} \\approx -3.732\n$$\n$$\nz_2 = -2 + \\sqrt{3} \\approx -0.268\n$$\nOne of these zeros, $z_1$, lies outside the unit circle ($|z_1| > 1$). Therefore, for any system with relative degree $r=3$ (and more generally, for $r \\ge 3$), ZOH introduces at least one additional nonminimum-phase zero for sufficiently small sampling periods.\n\n**2. First-Order Hold (FOH) Analysis**\n\nA similar asymptotic analysis for the First-Order Hold (FOH) shows that for a system with relative degree $r$, the sampling zeros approach the roots of a different set of polynomials. For $r=3$, the two sampling zeros asymptotically approach the roots of the polynomial $z^2 + 3z + 1 = 0$. The roots are:\n$$\nz = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}\n$$\nThe limiting locations of the two sampling zeros are:\n$$\nz_1 = \\frac{-3 - \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\approx -2.618\n$$\n$$\nz_2 = \\frac{-3 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\approx -0.382\n$$\nOne of these zeros, $z_1$, lies outside the unit circle ($|z_1| > 1$). Therefore, for a system with relative degree $r=3$, the FOH also introduces an additional nonminimum-phase zero for small sampling periods. However, this zero at $\\approx -2.618$ is closer to the unit circle than the ZOH-induced zero at $\\approx -3.732$.\n\n**3. Parameterized Example Application  Evaluation of Options**\n\nThe plant is $G(s) = \\frac{s - 1}{(s + 1)(s + 2)(s + 3)(s + 4)}$, with $b=1$, $r=3$. The discrete-time system will have $3$ zeros.\n- One zero is the mapped zero from $s=1$: $z_b = e^{1 \\cdot T} = e^T$. Since $T>0$, $e^T > 1$, so this is a nonminimum-phase zero under both ZOH and FOH.\n- The remaining two are sampling zeros.\n\n- **Under ZOH**: As $T \\to 0^+$, the two sampling zeros approach $z \\approx -3.732$ and $z \\approx -0.268$. The first is nonminimum-phase.\n- **Under FOH**: As $T \\to 0^+$, the two sampling zeros approach $z \\approx -2.618$ and $z \\approx -0.382$. The first is nonminimum-phase.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n\n-   **A.** The first sentence, \"Zero-order hold is more likely to introduce additional nonminimum-phase discrete-time zeros for relative degree $r \\ge 3$,\" is a reasonable qualitative statement, as the ZOH-induced zero is more severely nonminimum-phase (further from the unit circle) than the FOH-induced one. The second sentence's description of the ZOH behavior is correct: \"the two additional sampling zeros under zero-order hold approach fixed negative real values with one strictly less than $-1$.\" However, its description of FOH behavior is incorrect: it claims the zeros approach $z=-1$ and remain stable, which is true for $r=2$ but not for $r=3$.\n-   **B.** This is incorrect. It reverses the roles and outcomes.\n-   **C.** This is incorrect. The choice of hold is critical.\n-   **D.** This is incorrect. It ignores the existence of sampling zeros.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nNone of the options are perfectly accurate. However, option A provides the most accurate description. Its primary claim (ZOH is more problematic) is a valid interpretation of the theory, and its characterization of the ZOH case is correct. The error lies in its characterization of the FOH case. Among the flawed choices, it is the best fit.\n\nFinal Verdict: **A** is the most accurate statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2876395"}]}
