A solution will now be provided.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe problem is solved in three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Conjugate Symmetry Property.\nWe start with the definition of the $N$-point DFT of a sequence $x[n]$:\n$$\nX[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n]\\,\\exp\\left(-\\mathrm{i}\\,\\frac{2\\pi}{N}\\,kn\\right)\n$$\nWe take the complex conjugate of this expression:\n$$\n\\overline{X[k]} = \\overline{\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n]\\,\\exp\\left(-\\mathrm{i}\\,\\frac{2\\pi}{N}\\,kn\\right)}\n$$\nUsing the properties of complex conjugation ($\\overline{z_1+z_2} = \\overline{z_1}+\\overline{z_2}$ and $\\overline{z_1 z_2} = \\overline{z_1}\\overline{z_2}$):\n$$\n\\overline{X[k]} = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\overline{x[n]} \\cdot \\overline{\\exp\\left(-\\mathrm{i}\\,\\frac{2\\pi}{N}\\,kn\\right)}\n$$\nThe problem states that $x[n]$ is real-valued, so $\\overline{x[n]} = x[n]$. For the exponential term, we use $\\overline{\\exp(i\\theta)} = \\exp(-i\\theta)$:\n$$\n\\overline{\\exp\\left(-\\mathrm{i}\\,\\frac{2\\pi}{N}\\,kn\\right)} = \\exp\\left(\\mathrm{i}\\,\\frac{2\\pi}{N}\\,kn\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting these back, we obtain:\n$$\n\\overline{X[k]} = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n]\\,\\exp\\left(\\mathrm{i}\\,\\frac{2\\pi}{N}\\,kn\\right)\n$$\nNow, let's examine the DFT definition for a frequency index $\\ell = -k$:\n$$\nX[-k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n]\\,\\exp\\left(-\\mathrm{i}\\,\\frac{2\\pi}{N}\\,(-k)n\\right) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n]\\,\\exp\\left(\\mathrm{i}\\,\\frac{2\\pi}{N}\\,kn\\right)\n$$\nBy comparing the expressions for $\\overline{X[k]}$ and $X[-k]$, we see they are identical.\n$$\n\\overline{X[k]} = X[-k]\n$$\nThe DFT is periodic with period $N$, meaning $X[m] = X[m \\pmod N]$. Therefore, $X[-k] = X[(-k) \\pmod N] = X[N-k]$ for $k=1, \\dots, N-1$. For $k=0$, $X[0]=X[0]$. Thus, the desired relationship between $X[k]$ and $X[\\ell]$ is:\n$$\nX[N-k] = \\overline{X[k]} \\quad \\text{for } k=0, 1, \\dots, N-1.\n$$\nThis is the conjugate symmetry property for the DFT of a real-valued sequence.

We use the derived property $X[12-k] = \\overline{X[k]}$ to find the remaining coefficients.\n- For $k=1$: $X[11] = X[12-1] = \\overline{X[1]} = \\overline{1 - 2\\mathrm{i}} = 1 + 2\\mathrm{i}$.\n- For $k=2$: $X[10] = X[12-2] = \\overline{X[2]} = \\overline{-\\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{i}} = -\\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{i}$.\n- For $k=3$: $X[9] = X[12-3] = \\overline{X[3]} = \\overline{\\frac{5}{3} - \\frac{4}{3}\\mathrm{i}} = \\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{4}{3}\\mathrm{i}$.\n- For $k=4$: $X[8] = X[12-4] = \\overline{X[4]} = \\overline{-2 + 1\\mathrm{i}} = -2 - 1\\mathrm{i}$.\n- For $k=5$: $X[7] = X[12-5] = \\overline{X[5]} = \\overline{\\frac{7}{5} + \\frac{6}{5}\\mathrm{i}} = \\frac{7}{5} - \\frac{6}{5}\\mathrm{i}$.\nThe full spectrum for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 11\\}$ is:\n- $X[0] = 6$\n- $X[1] = 1 - 2\\mathrm{i}$\n- $X[2] = -\\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{i}$\n- $X[3] = \\frac{5}{3} - \\frac{4}{3}\\mathrm{i}$\n- $X[4] = -2 + 1\\mathrm{i}$\n- $X[5] = \\frac{7}{5} + \\frac{6}{5}\\mathrm{i}$\n- $X[6] = -4$\n- $X[7] = \\frac{7}{5} - \\frac{6}{5}\\mathrm{i}$\n- $X[8] = -2 - 1\\mathrm{i}$\n- $X[9] = \\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{4}{3}\\mathrm{i}$\n- $X[10] = -\\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{i}$\n- $X[11] = 1 + 2\\mathrm{i}$\n\nPart 3: Computation of the scalar $S$.\nThe scalar $S$ is defined as:\n$$\nS \\triangleq \\sum_{k=0}^{11} \\left|\\,X[k] - \\overline{X[(-k)\\bmod 12]}\\,\\right|^{2}\n$$\nLet us analyze the term inside the summation, $X[k] - \\overline{X[(-k)\\bmod 12]}$.\nThe modulo operation $(-k)\\bmod 12$ results in:\n- For $k=0$: $(-0)\\bmod 12 = 0$.\n- For $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 11\\}$: $(-k)\\bmod 12 = 12-k$.\n\nWe examine the term for these two cases.\nCase 1: $k=0$.\nThe term is $X[0] - \\overline{X[0]}$. Since $x[n]$ is real, its sum $\\sum x[n]$ is real. From the DFT definition, $X[0] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n]$, which must be a real number. Therefore, $X[0]=\\overline{X[0]}$, and the term is $X[0] - X[0] = 0$.\n\nCase 2: $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 11\\}$.\nThe term is $X[k] - \\overline{X[12-k]}$.\nFrom the conjugate symmetry property derived in Part 1, we know that $X[12-k] = \\overline{X[k]}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression, we get:\n$$\nX[k] - \\overline{(\\overline{X[k]})}\n$$\nFor any complex number $z$, $\\overline{\\overline{z}} = z$. Applying this, we have $\\overline{\\overline{X[k]}} = X[k]$. The expression becomes:\n$$\nX[k] - X[k] = 0\n$$\nThus, for every value of $k$ from $0$ to $11$, the term inside the absolute value is exactly $0$. It is not necessary to use the specific numerical values of $X[k]$, as the result follows directly from the fact that $x[n]$ is real.\nThe sum $S$ is therefore:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{k=0}^{11} |0|^2 = \\sum_{k=0}^{11} 0 = 0\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2911736"}, {"introduction": "Reconstructing a signal from a limited number of its frequency components—a process equivalent to ideal low-pass filtering—is a common task, but it can introduce significant artifacts.

The provided definitions are standard, and the regime $1 \\ll M \\ll N$ is appropriate for analyzing the correspondence between the discrete and continuous Fourier analysis. I will proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem investigates the properties of a signal reconstructed from a truncated Fourier spectrum. The starting point is the function $f(t) = A\\,\\mathrm{sgn}(\\sin(\\tfrac{2\\pi t}{T}))$, which is a square wave. It equals $A$ for $t \\in (0, T/2)$ and $-A$ for $t \\in (T/2, T)$, with jump discontinuities at integer multiples of $T/2$. The jump at $t=0$ is from $f(0^-)=-A$ to $f(0^+)=A$, so the jump magnitude is $\\Delta f = A - (-A) = 2A$, consistent with the problem statement.\n\nThe reconstructed function $g_M(t_n)$ is based on a sharp spectral truncation. In the regime $1 \\ll M \\ll N$, this discrete reconstruction closely approximates the continuous partial Fourier series sum:\n$g_M(t) = \\sum_{k=-M}^{M} c_k e^{i k \\omega_0 t}$, where $\\omega_0 = \\frac{2\\pi}{T}$\nThe complex Fourier coefficients $c_k$ for this odd function are purely imaginary, $c_k = -i\\frac{2A}{k\\pi}$ for odd $k$ and $c_k = 0$ for even $k$.

As $M$ increases, the peak overshoot of $g_M(t)$ adjacent to the discontinuity approaches approximately $0.08949\\,\\Delta f$ and does not vanish with increasing $M$, independent of $N$.\nThe first peak of the overshoot for large $M$ occurs at $t_p \\approx T/(2M)$. The value of the function at this peak, in the limit $M \\to \\infty$, is given by:\n$g_\\infty(t_p) = \\frac{2A}{\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} dx = \\frac{2A}{\\pi} \\mathrm{Si}(\\pi)$\nwhere $\\mathrm{Si}(\\pi) \\approx 1.85194$ is the sine integral. The limit of the function just past the jump is $f(0^+) = A$. The overshoot is the difference between the peak and this limit value:\n$\\text{Overshoot} = g_\\infty(t_p) - A = A \\left( \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\mathrm{Si}(\\pi) - 1 \\right) \\approx A(1.17898 - 1) = 0.17898 A$\nSince the jump magnitude is $\\Delta f = 2A$, the overshoot is approximately $0.17898 (\\Delta f / 2) = 0.08949 \\Delta f$. This is a constant fraction of the jump that does not vanish as $M$ increases. The 'independent of $N$' part is true because we assume $N \\gg M$, which means the discretization error is negligible and does not affect the phenomenon.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. The characteristic temporal width of the main ringing lobe (for example, the time from the discontinuity to the first zero-crossing of the oscillation) scales proportionally to $1/M$.\nThe 'frequency' of the ringing is determined by the highest frequency component included in the sum, which is proportional to $M$. By the uncertainty principle in Fourier analysis, a signal with a spectral bandwidth of $\\Delta\\omega \\sim M\\omega_0$ will have temporal features of a width $\\Delta t \\sim 1/\\Delta\\omega \\sim 1/(M\\omega_0)$. Since $\\omega_0=2\\pi/T$ is a constant, the temporal width scales as $T/M$. Specifically, the first peak of the Gibbs ringing occurs at $t_p \\approx T/(2M)$, and the following minimum at $t_m \\approx T/M$. The distance from the discontinuity to the first peak, or the distance between the first peak and first minimum, both scale as $1/M$. Therefore, any reasonable definition of the characteristic width of the ringing lobe will exhibit this scaling.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nC. If, before inverse transforming, the truncated spectrum $\\{X_k\\}_{|k|\\le M}$ is zero-padded by an integer factor $L>1$ (producing an $LN$-point inverse DFT on a finer time grid), then the maximum overshoot of $g_M(t)$ is reduced by a factor $1/L$ compared to the unpadded case.\nZero-padding in the frequency domain is a standard technique for interpolation in the time domain. It does not alter the underlying continuous-time function being sampled; it only provides more samples of it. The function exhibiting the Gibbs overshoot is $g_M(t)$, whose shape and peak value are determined by $M$ and the original function's jump, not by the number of sample points $N$. Zero-padding will not change the maximum value of $g_M(t)$. It will only create a denser set of points $g_M(t'_m)$ which may sample closer to the true peak, potentially increasing the *observed* maximum in the discrete data, but it will never reduce it. The statement is fundamentally incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Replacing the sharp spectral truncation by Cesàro (Fejér) summation, i.e., multiplying the retained Fourier modes by triangular weights $w_k=1-|k|/(M+1)$ for $|k|\\le M$ and $w_k=0$ otherwise, removes the oscillatory overshoot near the discontinuity and yields convergence of $g_M(t)$ at the discontinuity to the midpoint value $(f_+ + f_-)/2$ as $M\\to\\infty$, where $f_\\pm$ are the one-sided limits.\nThis statement accurately describes the properties of Cesàro summation. Using these weights is equivalent to convolving the function $f(t)$ with the Fejér kernel, which, unlike the Dirichlet kernel associated with sharp truncation, is a non-negative function. Convolution with a non-negative kernel cannot produce values outside the range of the original function. For the square wave, the reconstructed values will be confined to $[-A, A]$, thus eliminating any overshoot. Furthermore, Fejér's theorem guarantees that for any function with a simple jump discontinuity, the Cesàro-summed Fourier series converges to the arithmetic mean of the left and right limits at the point of discontinuity. For the square wave at $t=0$, this limit is $(f(0^+) + f(0^-))/2 = (A + (-A))/2 = 0$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nE. At fixed $M$, increasing $N$ alone eventually eliminates the Gibbs ringing in $g_M(t)$ because the DFT becomes a better approximation to the continuous Fourier series.\nThe Gibbs phenomenon is an inherent property of the sharply truncated continuous Fourier series $g_M(t)$; it is not an artifact of the discretization (sampling). In the regime $M \\ll N$, the DFT-based reconstruction $g_M(t_n)$ is already a very good approximation of $g_M(t)$ sampled at points $t_n$. Increasing $N$ while keeping $M$ fixed only improves this approximation, providing a more detailed picture of the very same ringing. It does not, and cannot, eliminate the ringing, whose presence is dictated by the choice of a finite $M$ and the sharp truncation.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "2387185"}]}
