We proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of computational costs for two methods of computing the DFT for a sequence of length $N=8$, and a detailed breakdown of the radix-$2$ decimation-in-time (DIT) FFT algorithm.\n\nThe cost model is explicitly defined:\n1.  A complex addition or subtraction costs $1$ complex addition.\n2.  A multiplication of a complex number by any twiddle factor $W_N^m$ costs $1$ complex multiplication, irrespective of the value of $m$. Simplifications for $m=0$ or other special cases are forbidden.\n\nLet $A$ denote the total count of complex additions and $M$ denote the total count of complex multiplications.\n\n**Part 1: Direct DFT Computation Cost**\n\nThe definition of the DFT is given as:\n$$\nX[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] W_{N}^{kn}\n$$\nFor a fixed output index $k$, the computation of $X[k]$ involves a sum of $N$ terms.\nEach term, $x[n]W_N^{kn}$, requires one complex multiplication. Given the strict cost model, this is true even for $kn=0$ or other integer multiples of $N$. Thus, for each value of $k$, there are $N$ complex multiplications.\nThe summation of these $N$ complex terms requires $N-1$ complex additions.\n\nSince $k$ ranges from $0$ to $N-1$, there are $N$ such output values to compute. Therefore, the total costs for the direct DFT computation are:\n- Total complex multiplications: $M_{\\text{DFT}} = N \\times N = N^2$.\n- Total complex additions: $A_{\\text{DFT}} = N \\times (N-1)$.\n\nFor $N=8$:\n$$\nM_{\\text{DFT}} = 8^2 = 64\n$$\n$$\nA_{\\text{DFT}} = 8 \\times (8-1) = 8 \\times 7 = 56\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Radix-2 DIT FFT Analysis**\n\nThe radix-$2$ FFT algorithm recursively breaks down a DFT of size $N$ into two DFTs of size $N/2$. For $N=2^v$, this results in $v = \\log_2(N)$ stages of computation. For $N=8$, we have $\\log_2(8) = 3$ stages.\n\nThe core computation in each stage is the \"butterfly\" operation, which combines two intermediate values, say $A$ and $B$, to produce two new values, $A'$ and $B'$:\n$$\nA' = A + W_N^e B\n$$\n$$\nB' = A - W_N^e B\n$$\nwhere $W_N^e$ is the appropriate twiddle factor. This computation can be implemented by first calculating the product $P = W_N^e B$, which costs $1$ complex multiplication. Then, $A' = A + P$ and $B' = A - P$ are computed, which costs $2$ complex additions. Thus, each butterfly operation requires exactly $1$ complex multiplication and $2$ complex additions under the specified cost model.\n\nIn a radix-$2$ FFT of size $N$, each of the $\\log_2(N)$ stages consists of $N/2$ such butterfly operations.\n\n**Butterfly Details for $N=8$ DIT-FFT**\n\nThe DIT-FFT algorithm requires the input sequence $x[n]$ to be reordered by bit-reversing the indices.

In this algorithm, the computation is organized as $m$ sequential stages of butterflies. Each butterfly combines two complex inputs and produces two complex outputs using exactly one complex multiplication by a stage-dependent twiddle factor and two complex additions. In the full, unpruned implementation, every butterfly at every stage is executed, and every such multiplication and addition is counted. In this problem, the arithmetic operation count is defined as the total number of complex multiplications plus the total number of complex additions. Memory moves and index permutations do not contribute to the operation count.\n\nDesign a truncated FFT that leverages the fact that $x[n]=0$ for all $n \\geq 2^{p}$ to avoid executing any butterfly whose arithmetic would be mathematically redundant because one or both of its inputs are known to be zero.

In the full radix-$2$ FFT, there are $N/2$ butterflies per stage and $m$ stages, so if we count one operation per complex multiplication and one operation per complex addition, then each butterfly contributes exactly $3$ operations.

In a radix-$2$ DIT flow, a butterfly’s two inputs at a given stage are formed from disjoint subsets of the original input samples. If both inputs to a butterfly are zero, its outputs are zero and the butterfly performs no useful arithmetic. If exactly one input is zero, then the nonzero input passes to both outputs (up to known trivial sign or routing), and again no complex multiplication or addition is needed to determine the outputs; one can bypass the arithmetic and simply route the value. Therefore, in a truncated implementation that exploits zeros, a butterfly incurs arithmetic only when both of its inputs are nonzero.\n\nWe now count, stage by stage, how many butterflies have both inputs nonzero under the assumption that $x[n]\\neq 0$ only for $n \\in \\{0,1,\\ldots,2^{p}-1\\}$. In a radix-$2$ DIT FFT, stage $s \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,m\\}$ groups indices into contiguous blocks of size $2^{s}$, and within each block, each butterfly connects an element in the first half of the block to the corresponding element in the second half of the block.

There is also a partial block of size $r \\triangleq L \\bmod 2^{s}$, which contributes $\\max\\{r - 2^{s-1}, 0\\}$ butterflies with both inputs nonzero (since within the partial block, a butterfly connects positions $j$ and $j+2^{s-1}$, and both are $< r$ precisely when $j < r - 2^{s-1}$).

So $m=1$.\n$5.96 - 180(0.003)(1) = c + 180(2a_{2} + 2a_{3} + a_{5})$\n$5.42 = c + 360a_{2} + 360a_{3} + 180a_{5}$ (IV)\n\nWe solve this system. Subtracting (I) from (IV):\n$(c + 360a_{2} + 360a_{3} + 180a_{5}) - (c + 360a_{2} + 120a_{3} + 120a_{5}) = 5.42 - 3.38$\n$240a_{3} + 60a_{5} = 2.04 \\implies 4a_{3} + a_{5} = 0.034$. (A)\n\nSubtract (II) from (I), (III) and (IV) to eliminate $c$:\n(I)-(II): $270a_{2} - 60a_{3} + 30a_{5} = 1.02 \\implies 9a_{2} - 2a_{3} + a_{5} = 0.034$. (B)\n(IV)-(II): $270a_{2} + 180a_{3} + 90a_{5} = 3.06 \\implies 3a_{2} + 2a_{3} + a_{5} = 0.034$. (C)\n\nFrom (B) and (C): $9a_{2} - 2a_{3} + a_{5} = 3a_{2} + 2a_{3} + a_{5} \\implies 6a_{2} = 4a_{3} \\implies a_{3} = 1.5 a_{2}$.\nSubstitute $a_{3}=1.5a_2$ into (A): $4(1.5a_{2}) + a_{5} = 0.034 \\implies 6a_{2} + a_{5} = 0.034 \\implies a_{5} = 0.034 - 6a_{2}$.\nSubstitute $a_3$ and $a_5$ into (C):\n$3a_{2} + 2(1.5a_{2}) + (0.034 - 6a_{2}) = 0.034$\n$3a_{2} + 3a_{2} - 6a_{2} + 0.034 = 0.034$, which gives $0=0$. This means the equations are not independent, indicating I must use the third equation. Let's use (III)-(II):\n(III)-(II): $60a_{2} - 30a_{3} + 210a_{5} = 2.16 \\implies 2a_{2} - a_{3} + 7a_{5} = 0.072$. (D)\n\nNow substitute $a_3=1.5a_2$ and $a_5=0.034-6a_2$ into (D):\n$2a_{2} - (1.5a_{2}) + 7(0.034 - 6a_{2}) = 0.072$\n$0.5a_{2} + 0.238 - 42a_{2} = 0.072$\n$-41.5a_{2} = 0.072 - 0.238 = -0.166$\n$a_{2} = \\frac{0.166}{41.5} = 0.004$.\n\nFrom this, we find:\n$a_{3} = 1.5 \\cdot a_{2} = 1.5 \\cdot 0.004 = 0.006$.\n$a_{5} = 0.034 - 6 \\cdot a_{2} = 0.034 - 6 \\cdot 0.004 = 0.034 - 0.024 = 0.010$.\n\nFinally, substitute these into (II) to find $c$:\n$2.36 = c + 90(0.004) + 180(0.006) + 90(0.010)$\n$2.36 = c + 0.36 + 1.08 + 0.90$\n$2.36 = c + 2.34 \\implies c = 0.02$.\n\nThe fitted parameters are: $c=0.02$, $a_{2}=0.004$, $a_{3}=0.006$, $a_{5}=0.010$, and $b=0.003$.\n\n**Task 3: Prediction of minimum time for $N_{\\text{new}}=360$**\nFor $N_{\\text{new}}=360=2^{3} \\cdot 3^{2} \\cdot 5^{1}$, we have $s_2=3, s_3=2, s_5=1$.\nThe total execution time is given by:\n$T(360, \\text{plan}) = c + 360(3a_{2} + 2a_{3} + a_{5}) + 360 b m(360, \\text{plan}; 16)$.\n\nTo achieve the minimum time, $T_{\\min}(360)$, we must select the plan that minimizes $m(360, \\text{plan}; 16)$. The stride at each stage is the product of the radices of all preceding stages. To keep this product as small as possible for as many stages as possible, one must order the radices from smallest to largest.\nThe available radices are three $2$s, two $3$s, and one $5$. The optimal plan is $\\langle 2,2,2,3,3,5 \\rangle$.\nLet us calculate $m$ for this plan:\n- Stage 1 (radix 2): stride = $1$\n- Stage 2 (radix 2): stride = $2$\n- Stage 3 (radix 2): stride = $2 \\cdot 2 = 4$\n- Stage 4 (radix 3): stride = $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 8$\n- Stage 5 (radix 3): stride = $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 24 > 16$. Penalty incurred.\n- Stage 6 (radix 5): stride = $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 = 72 > 16$. Penalty incurred.\nThe minimum number of stages with penalized strides is $m_{\\min}=2$.\n\nNow, we compute $T_{\\min}(360)$ using the fitted parameters and $m_{\\min}=2$:\n$T_{\\min}(360) = 0.02 + 360(3 \\cdot 0.004 + 2 \\cdot 0.006 + 1 \\cdot 0.010) + 360 \\cdot 0.003 \\cdot 2$\n$T_{\\min}(360) = 0.02 + 360(0.012 + 0.012 + 0.010) + 1.08 \\cdot 2$\n$T_{\\min}(360) = 0.02 + 360(0.034) + 2.16$\n$T_{\\min}(360) = 0.02 + 12.24 + 2.16$\n$T_{\\min}(360) = 14.42$.\n\nThe predicted minimum execution time is $14.42$ microseconds.
