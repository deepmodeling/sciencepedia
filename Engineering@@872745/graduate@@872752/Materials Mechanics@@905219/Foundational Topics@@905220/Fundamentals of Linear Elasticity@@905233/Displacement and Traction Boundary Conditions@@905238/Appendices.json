It is a well-posed problem in one-dimensional linear elasticity, free of scientific or logical flaws, and provides all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem requires deriving the one-dimensional governing equation from the three-dimensional static balance of linear momentum. In a static condition, with no acceleration, the balance of linear momentum is stated as:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} + \\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{0} $$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the Cauchy stress tensor and $\\mathbf{b}$ is the body force vector per unit volume.\n\nLet the axial direction of the bar be along the $x$-axis. The body force is given as a uniform field in the axial direction, so $\\mathbf{b} = (\\beta, 0, 0)$, where $\\beta$ is a constant. The assumptions that plane cross-sections remain plane and that stress is uniform across any given cross-section at a position $x$ reduce the stress state to a uniaxial one. The only non-zero component of the stress tensor is the axial normal stress, $\\sigma_{xx}$, which depends only on the axial coordinate $x$. We denote this as $\\sigma_x(x)$. All other stress components are zero: $\\sigma_{yy} = \\sigma_{zz} = \\sigma_{xy} = \\sigma_{xz} = \\sigma_{yz} = 0$.\n\nThe divergence of the stress tensor, $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, in Cartesian coordinates expands into three equations for each component $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{ix}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{iy}}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{iz}}{\\partial z} + b_i = 0 $$\nFor the $x$-direction ($i=1$):\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{xx}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{xy}}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{xz}}{\\partial z} + b_x = 0 $$\nSubstituting the assumed stress state and body force, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{d\\sigma_x(x)}{dx} + \\beta = 0 $$\nFor the $y$- and $z$-directions, the equations are identically satisfied ($0=0$). Thus, the three-dimensional theory correctly reduces to a single differential equation for the axial stress.\n\nNext, we introduce the kinematic and constitutive relations. For small strains, the axial strain $\\epsilon_x$ is related to the axial displacement field $u(x)$ by:\n$$ \\epsilon_x = \\frac{du}{dx} $$\nThe material behavior is linear elastic (Hooke's Law), relating stress and strain via the Young's modulus $E$:\n$$ \\sigma_x = E \\epsilon_x $$\nCombining these two relations, we express the stress in terms of the displacement:\n$$ \\sigma_x = E \\frac{du}{dx} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\sigma_x$ into the one-dimensional equilibrium equation yields the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the displacement $u(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(E \\frac{du}{dx}\\right) + \\beta = 0 $$\nSince Young's modulus $E$ is given as constant, the equation becomes:\n$$ E \\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + \\beta = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\beta}{E} $$\nThis is the second-order ODE representing the strong form of the boundary value problem. We solve this equation by integrating twice with respect to $x$. The first integration gives the gradient of the displacement:\n$$ \\frac{du}{dx} = \\int \\left(-\\frac{\\beta}{E}\\right) dx = -\\frac{\\beta}{E}x + C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is the first constant of integration. A second integration yields the general solution for the displacement field $u(x)$:\n$$ u(x) = \\int \\left(-\\frac{\\beta}{E}x + C_1\\right) dx = -\\frac{\\beta}{2E}x^2 + C_1 x + C_2 $$\nwhere $C_2$ is the second constant of integration.\n\nThe constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined by applying the prescribed essential (displacement) boundary conditions: $u(0)=0$ and $u(L)=\\delta$.\n\nApplying the first boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$ u(0) = -\\frac{\\beta}{2E}(0)^2 + C_1(0) + C_2 = 0 $$\nThis immediately gives $C_2=0$. The solution simplifies to:\n$$ u(x) = -\\frac{\\beta}{2E}x^2 + C_1 x $$\nApplying the second boundary condition at $x=L$:\n$$ u(L) = -\\frac{\\beta}{2E}L^2 + C_1 L = \\delta $$\nWe solve this algebraic equation for $C_1$:\n$$ C_1 L = \\delta + \\frac{\\beta L^2}{2E} $$\n$$ C_1 = \\frac{\\delta}{L} + \\frac{\\beta L}{2E} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $C_1$ and $C_2$ back into the general solution for $u(x)$ gives the final, particular solution:\n$$ u(x) = -\\frac{\\beta}{2E}x^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\delta}{L} + \\frac{\\beta L}{2E}\\right)x $$\nThis expression can be rearranged for better physical interpretation by grouping terms related to the boundary displacement and terms related to the body force:\n$$ u(x) = \\frac{\\delta x}{L} + \\frac{\\beta L x}{2E} - \\frac{\\beta x^2}{2E} $$\n$$ u(x) = \\frac{\\delta x}{L} + \\frac{\\beta x}{2E}(L - x) $$\nThe first term, $\\frac{\\delta x}{L}$, represents the linear displacement field in the absence of body forces. The second term, $\\frac{\\beta x}{2E}(L-x)$, is the additional parabolic displacement profile caused by the uniform body force, which is zero at both ends $x=0$ and $x=L$.\n\nFinally, we explicitly verify that this solution satisfies the given boundary conditions.\nFor $x=0$:\n$$ u(0) = \\frac{\\delta (0)}{L} + \\frac{\\beta (0)}{2E}(L - 0) = 0 + 0 = 0 $$\nThe condition $u(0)=0$ is satisfied.\nFor $x=L$:\n$$ u(L) = \\frac{\\delta (L)}{L} + \\frac{\\beta (L)}{2E}(L - L) = \\delta + \\frac{\\beta L}{2E}(0) = \\delta $$\nThe condition $u(L)=\\delta$ is satisfied.

This confirms that the zero traction field belongs to $L^2(\\Gamma_t)$. The verification is trivial.\n\n3. Determination of the leading-order singularity exponent.\n\nWe seek a solution to the boundary value problem using separation of variables. Let $w(r, \\theta) = f(r)g(\\theta)$. Substituting into Laplace's equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{r^2 f''(r) + r f'(r)}{f(r)} = - \\frac{g''(\\theta)}{g(\\theta)} = \\lambda^2\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda^2$ is the separation constant. This yields two ordinary differential equations:\n$$\ng''(\\theta) + \\lambda^2 g(\\theta) = 0\n$$\n$$\nr^2 f''(r) + r f'(r) - \\lambda^2 f(r) = 0\n$$\nThe general solution for the angular part is $g(\\theta) = A\\cos(\\lambda\\theta) + B\\sin(\\lambda\\theta)$. Applying the boundary conditions on the wedge faces:\n$$\ng'(0) = 0 \\implies [-A\\lambda\\sin(\\lambda\\theta) + B\\lambda\\cos(\\lambda\\theta)]_{\\theta=0} = B\\lambda = 0\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution, we take $B=0$. The solution becomes $g(\\theta) = A\\cos(\\lambda\\theta)$. Applying the second boundary condition:\n$$\ng'(\\omega) = 0 \\implies -A\\lambda\\sin(\\lambda\\omega) = 0\n$$\nFor $A \\neq 0$ and $\\lambda \\neq 0$, we must have $\\sin(\\lambda\\omega) = 0$. This condition determines the eigenvalues:\n$$\n\\lambda\\omega = n\\pi \\implies \\lambda_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{\\omega}, \\quad n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots\n$$\nThe radial equation is a Cauchy-Euler equation. For a given $\\lambda_n$, the solution is $f_n(r) = C_n r^{\\lambda_n} + D_n r^{-\\lambda_n}$.\nThe general solution is a superposition of the separated solutions:\n$$\nw(r, \\theta) = (C_0 + D_0 \\ln r) + \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty (C_n r^{\\lambda_n} + D_n r^{-\\lambda_n}) \\cos(\\lambda_n \\theta)\n$$\nWe are interested in the behavior as $r \\to 0$. We select terms that are most dominant as $r \\to 0$. For a physically meaningful solution, the strain energy stored in any neighborhood of the origin must be finite. The strain energy density scales with $|\\nabla w|^2$. For a solution term of the form $w \\sim r^\\alpha$, the gradient $|\\nabla w|$ scales as $r^{\\alpha-1}$. The integrability of strain energy near $r=0$ requires $\\int_0^\\epsilon (r^{\\alpha-1})^2 r dr < \\infty$, which simplifies to $\\int_0^\\epsilon r^{2\\alpha-1} dr < \\infty$. This integral converges if $2\\alpha - 1 > -1$, which implies $\\alpha > 0$.\nThus, we must only consider positive eigenvalues, $\\lambda_n > 0$. The $\\ln r$ term and all terms with negative exponents $r^{-\\lambda_n}$ are discarded as they lead to infinite strain energy. The constant term ($n=0$, $\\lambda_0=0$) corresponds to a rigid-body displacement and can be set to zero.\n\nThe solution near the origin takes the form:\n$$\nw(r, \\theta) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty C_n r^{\\lambda_n} \\cos(\\lambda_n \\theta)\n$$\nThe leading-order behavior as $r \\to 0$ is governed by the term with the smallest positive eigenvalue, which is $\\lambda_1 = \\pi/\\omega$.\n$$\nw(r, \\theta) \\approx C_1 r^{\\pi/\\omega} \\cos(\\frac{\\pi\\theta}{\\omega}) \\quad \\text{as } r \\to 0\n$$\nThe problem asks for the exponent $p$ in the asymptotic expression for the magnitude of the displacement gradient, $|\\nabla w| \\sim C(\\theta) r^p$.\nLet us compute the gradient for the leading term, where we denote $\\lambda = \\lambda_1 = \\pi/\\omega$:\n$$\n\\nabla w = \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial r}\\mathbf{e}_r + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\theta}\\mathbf{e}_\\theta \\approx C_1 \\lambda r^{\\lambda-1} \\cos(\\lambda\\theta) \\mathbf{e}_r - C_1 r^{\\lambda-1} \\lambda \\sin(\\lambda\\theta) \\mathbf{e}_\\theta\n$$\nThe magnitude of the gradient is:\n$$\n|\\nabla w| = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial r}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\theta}\\right)^2} \\approx \\sqrt{(C_1 \\lambda r^{\\lambda-1} \\cos(\\lambda\\theta))^2 + (-C_1 \\lambda r^{\\lambda-1} \\sin(\\lambda\\theta))^2}\n$$\n$$\n|\\nabla w| \\approx \\sqrt{C_1^2 \\lambda^2 r^{2(\\lambda-1)} (\\cos^2(\\lambda\\theta) + \\sin^2(\\lambda\\theta))} = |C_1 \\lambda| r^{\\lambda-1}\n$$\nBy comparing this to the given form $|\\nabla w| \\sim C(\\theta) r^p$, we identify the exponent $p$ as:\n$$\np = \\lambda - 1 = \\lambda_1 - 1 = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega} - 1\n$$\nThe problem specifies the wedge opening angle $\\omega = 3\\pi/2$. Substituting this value:\n$$\np = \\frac{\\pi}{3\\pi/2} - 1 = \\frac{2}{3} - 1 = -\\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nThe negative exponent indicates that the displacement gradient is singular at the corner $r=0$, which is expected for a re-entrant corner ($\\omega > \\pi$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{3}}\n$$", "id": "2879054"}]}
