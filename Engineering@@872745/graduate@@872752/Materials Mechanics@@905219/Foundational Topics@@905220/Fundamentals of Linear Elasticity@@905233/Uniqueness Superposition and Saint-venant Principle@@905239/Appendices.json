In component form, this is:\n$$ u_x(x,y) = c_x - \\omega y $$\n$$ u_y(x,y) = c_y + \\omega x $$\nA rigid body motion, by definition, induces zero strain: $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\boldsymbol{u}_{RBM}) = \\boldsymbol{0}$. Consequently, the stress field is also zero, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\boldsymbol{u}_{RBM}) = \\boldsymbol{0}$, because the material is unstressed in the reference configuration.

Substituting this into the expression for $u_x$:\n$$ c_x - \\omega y = 0 \\quad \\forall y \\in [0, \\delta] \\cup [H-\\delta, H] $$\nSince $\\delta \\in (0, H/2)$, this set of points for $y$ contains at least two distinct points (for example, $y_1=0$ and $y_2=H$). We must therefore have:\n$$ c_x - \\omega y_1 = 0 $$\n$$ c_x - \\omega y_2 = 0 $$\nSubtracting these equations yields $\\omega(y_2 - y_1) = 0$. As $y_1 \\neq y_2$, we must conclude that $\\omega=0$. Substituting $\\omega=0$ back into either equation gives $c_x=0$.\n\nThe parameter $c_y$ remains entirely unconstrained. Thus, any rigid body motion of the form $\\boldsymbol{u} = (0, c_y)$ for any constant $c_y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ satisfies all homogeneous equations and boundary conditions. This represents a uniform vertical translation. For any $c_y \\neq 0$, this is a non-trivial rigid body motion. If $\\boldsymbol{u}_{sol}$ is one solution to the original problem, then $\\boldsymbol{u}_{sol} + (0, c_y)$ is also a solution for any $c_y$. This constitutes an infinite set of solutions, demonstrating non-uniqueness.\n\nThe standard uniqueness theorem for linear elasticity (a consequence of Clapeyron's theorem) relies on showing that the strain energy associated with the difference solution $\\boldsymbol{u}_D$ is zero. The strain energy is given by $U = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{\\Omega} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_D : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_D \\, dV$. Using the divergence theorem and equilibrium, this can be equated to the work done by boundary tractions: $U = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{\\partial\\Omega} \\boldsymbol{t}_D \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}_D \\, dS$.\n$$ \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} \\boldsymbol{t}_D \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}_D \\, dS = \\int_{\\Gamma_t} \\boldsymbol{t}_D \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}_D \\, dS + \\int_{\\Gamma_u} \\boldsymbol{t}_D \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}_D \\, dS $$\nOn $\\Gamma_t$, $\\boldsymbol{t}_D = \\boldsymbol{0}$, so the first integral vanishes. On $\\Gamma_u$, we have $u_{D,x}=0$. The integral becomes:\n$$ \\int_{\\Gamma_u} (t_{D,x} u_{D,x} + t_{D,y} u_{D,y}) \\, dS = \\int_{\\Gamma_u} t_{D,y} u_{D,y} \\, dS $$\nThe standard proof requires this integral to be zero. This is guaranteed if the full displacement vector is prescribed on $\\Gamma_u$, i.e., $\\boldsymbol{u}_D = \\boldsymbol{0}$ on $\\Gamma_u$. In our problem, however, only one component is prescribed. We have no guarantee that $u_{D,y}=0$ or that the reaction traction component $t_{D,y}$ is zero on $\\Gamma_u$. Therefore, we cannot conclude that $U=0$, which would imply $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_D=\\boldsymbol{0}$ and that $\\boldsymbol{u}_D$ is a rigid body motion. The **violated hypothesis is that the displacement vector is not fully specified on the boundary portion $\\Gamma_u$**. The prescribed displacement conditions are insufficient to prevent a rigid body motion.\n\nFinally, we are asked for the dimension of the vector space of planar rigid body motions consistent with the essential boundary conditions. A general planar rigid body motion is parameterized by the vector $(c_x, c_y, \\omega) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. The space of all such motions is of dimension $3$. The constraints derived from the boundary conditions are $c_x = 0$ and $\\omega = 0$. The parameter $c_y$ is free.\nThe subspace of admissible motions is therefore the set of vectors of the form $(0, c_y, 0)$, where $c_y$ is any real number. This is a $1$-dimensional vector space spanned by the basis vector $(0,1,0)$, which corresponds to the unit vertical translation field $\\boldsymbol{u}=(0,1)$. The dimension of this space is therefore $1$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1} $$", "id": "2928632"}, {"introduction": "The principle of superposition is an invaluable tool for solving complex problems, allowing us to analyze the effects of combined loads by summing the effects of individual loads.

For a mechanical system, this means that the displacement must be a linear function of the applied load, i.e., $u(P) = k P$ for some constant $k$. The elastoplastic constitutive model is non-linear. The response function $u(P)$ is piecewise linear, with a change in slope at the yield point $P=P_y$:\n$$\nu(P) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{PL}{AE}  \\text{if } P \\le P_y \\\\ \\frac{P_y L}{AE} + \\frac{(P-P_y)L}{AE_T}  \\text{if } P  P_y \\end{cases}\n$$\nBecause the function $u(P)$ is not a single linear function passing through the origin, the property $u(P_1+P_2) = u(P_1) + u(P_2)$ does not hold in general. In this specific case, $u_{\\text{virgin}}(P_1)$ and $u_{\\text{virgin}}(P_2)$ are calculated on the first linear segment, while $u_{\\text{actual}}(P_1+P_2)$ is calculated on the second segment. The naive superposition $u_{\\text{virgin}}(P_1) + u_{\\text{virgin}}(P_2)$ is equivalent to calculating the displacement for the total load $P_1+P_2$ using only the initial elastic modulus $E$, thereby ignoring the change in material stiffness (the tangent modulus becomes $E_T$) after yielding. The error $\\Delta u$ quantifies this discrepancy, which arises because the state of the material (and thus its response) depends on the magnitude of the load.\n\nRegarding uniqueness, for the given problem of monotonic tensile loading of a bar made of a rate-independent, stable ($H0$) elastoplastic material, the solution is unique. The monotonic loading path ensures that for any given final stress $\\sigma_{final}  \\sigma_y$, there is a unique corresponding total strain $\\varepsilon_{final}$ determined by the single-valued loading curve $\\sigma(\\varepsilon)$. Since equilibrium dictates a uniform stress $\\sigma = P/A$ and compatibility requires a uniform strain $\\varepsilon = u/L$, a given load $P$ uniquely determines the stress, which in turn uniquely determines the strain and the final displacement. Path-dependence, a hallmark of plasticity, would become critical under non-monotonic or non-proportional loading, where the final state depends on the entire history of loading, not just the final load. However, for the simple path considered here, uniqueness is guaranteed.

In the absence of body forces and with traction-free lateral surfaces, one can expand the difference field in a series of longitudinally decaying modes\n$$\n\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(x,y,z) \\sim \\sum_{k} \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{k}(y,z)\\,\\exp(-\\lambda_{k} x),\n$$\nwhere the cross-sectional mode shapes $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{k}(y,z)$ and decay rates $\\lambda_{k}  0$ are determined by a two-dimensional eigenvalue problem posed on the cross-section. The slowest decay is controlled by the smallest positive decay rate $\\lambda_{\\min}$; at sufficiently large $x$,\n$$\n\\Delta \\sigma_{\\max}(x) \\lesssim C\\,\\exp(-\\lambda_{\\min} x)\\,\\Delta \\sigma_{\\max}(0^{+}),\n$$\nfor some dimensionless constant $C$ depending only on geometric normalization and the choice of norm. For an order-of-magnitude estimate consistent with the spirit of Saint–Venant’s principle, it is customary to take $C$ of order unity and adopt a conservative normalization for the initial amplitude.\n\nTo identify $\\lambda_{\\min}$ for a rectangular cross-section, we recall that the longitudinally decaying modes arise from a separation-of-variables reduction of the three-dimensional linear elasticity problem to a two-dimensional spectral problem on the cross-section, which, in the simplest representation for end effects without lateral tractions, reduces to a scalar Helmholtz-type eigenvalue problem with Neumann boundary conditions on $\\partial \\Omega$. Specifically, the cross-sectional dependence of the stress or displacement potentials satisfies\n$$\n-\\Delta_{\\perp} \\phi(y,z) = \\lambda^{2} \\,\\phi(y,z) \\quad \\text{in } \\Omega, \\qquad \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial n} = 0 \\quad \\text{on } \\partial \\Omega,\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta_{\\perp}$ is the two-dimensional Laplacian on the $y$–$z$ plane, and the Neumann boundary condition reflects the traction-free lateral surfaces. The zero eigenvalue $\\lambda=0$ corresponds to rigid-body or polynomial modes that are excluded by self-equilibration constraints (zero resultant force and zero first moments). Thus, the relevant decay rates are the positive square roots of the nonzero Neumann eigenvalues on the rectangle.\n\nFor a rectangle of side lengths $b$ (in $y$) and $h$ (in $z$), the Neumann eigenfunctions are products of cosines, and the corresponding eigenvalues are\n$$\n\\lambda_{m n} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{m \\pi}{b}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{n \\pi}{h}\\right)^{2}}, \\qquad m,n \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0},\n$$\nwith $(m,n) \\ne (0,0)$. The constraints of self-equilibration at the end remove the $(0,0)$ mode; modes with either $m \\ge 1, n=0$ or $m=0, n \\ge 1$ are admissible and have zero cross-sectional average, thereby satisfying the zero resultant condition. Among these admissible modes, the smallest positive decay rate is\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\min} = \\min\\!\\left\\{ \\frac{\\pi}{b},\\,\\frac{\\pi}{h} \\right\\} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\max\\{b,h\\}}.\n$$\nThis shows that the slowest decay (largest penetration distance) is governed by the largest cross-sectional dimension.\n\nWith this characterization, a conservative estimate for the required distance $x_{\\eta}$ ensuring\n$$\n\\Delta \\sigma_{\\max}(x) \\le \\eta \\,\\sigma_{b,\\max}(x)\n$$\ncan be obtained by bounding the ratio of the difference field to the classical bending stress by a single decaying exponential, normalized at the end section. Adopting the conservative normalization\n$$\n\\Delta \\sigma_{\\max}(0^{+}) = \\sigma_{b,\\max}(0^{+}),\n$$\nand taking the modal prefactor $C$ as unity for a conservative bound, we impose\n$$\n\\exp(-\\lambda_{\\min} x_{\\eta}) \\le \\eta,\n$$\nwhich yields the estimate\n$$\nx_{\\eta} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\min}} \\,\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\right) = \\frac{\\max\\{b,h\\}}{\\pi} \\,\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\right).\n$$\n\nWe now evaluate this expression for the given data.
