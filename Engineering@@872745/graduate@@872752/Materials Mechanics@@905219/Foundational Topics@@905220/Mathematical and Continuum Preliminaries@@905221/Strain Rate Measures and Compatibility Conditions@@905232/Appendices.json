The incompatibility operator is linear, so $\\text{inc}(\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\alpha}) = \\text{inc}(\\boldsymbol{D}_{0}) + \\text{inc}(\\alpha \\varphi \\boldsymbol{I})$.

For the field $\\alpha\\varphi\\boldsymbol{I}$, this becomes $\\alpha\\varphi_{,22} + \\alpha\\varphi_{,11} = 0$. With $\\varphi = x_{1}^{2} + 2x_{2}^{2} - x_{3}^{2}$, we have $\\varphi_{,11} = 2$ and $\\varphi_{,22} = 4$. The condition becomes $\\alpha(4) + \\alpha(2) = 6\\alpha = 0$, which requires $\\alpha=0$. Thus, if $\\alpha \\neq 0$, the field is not compatible. This confirms the uniqueness of the solution from the standpoint of compatibility as well.\n\nBoth conditions independently necessitate that $\\alpha$ must be $0$.
