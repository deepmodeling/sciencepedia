It presents a standard exercise in continuum mechanics, specifically in the theory of plasticity for ductile metals. All necessary information is provided, and the questions are unambiguous.

Argue whether an isotropic, pressure-insensitive yield criterion would predict yielding.\nThe problem states that the material is pressure-insensitive and its yield function depends only on shear measures. The von Mises and Tresca criteria are paradigm examples of such criteria.\nThe von Mises yield criterion posits that yielding begins when the von Mises effective stress, $\\sigma_v$, reaches the material's uniaxial yield strength, $\\sigma_Y$.

The von Mises criterion predicts no yielding.\n\nThe Tresca yield criterion posits that yielding begins when the maximum shear stress, $\\tau_{\\max}$, reaches the shear yield strength, $k$. A common form of the criterion is $2\\tau_{\\max} = \\sigma_Y$, which is equivalent to $m_T = \\sigma_Y$. For the given loading, we found $m_T = 0\\,\\text{MPa}$. The yield condition becomes:\n$$\n0 = \\sigma_Y\n$$\nAgain, as $\\sigma_Y  0$, this condition is not met. The Tresca criterion also predicts no yielding.\n\nThe conclusion is direct and unambiguous. Both criteria are founded on the principle that plastic deformation (yielding) in ductile metals is driven by shear, which facilitates crystallographic slip. A purely hydrostatic stress state, by definition, induces no shear stresses; the deviatoric stress tensor is null. Consequently, any yield criterion that is a function only of deviatoric stress invariants (like von Mises, which depends on $J_2$) or maximum shear stress (like Tresca) will predict that no yielding occurs under such a loading, regardless of the magnitude of the hydrostatic pressure.

The identity tensor is denoted by $\\boldsymbol{I}$.\n\nConsider a new stress state, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'$, formed by adding a hydrostatic stress $\\alpha\\boldsymbol{I}$ to the original stress state $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}' = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} + \\alpha\\boldsymbol{I} $$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a scalar.\n\nThe hydrostatic pressure of this new stress state, $p'$, is:\n$$ p' = \\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}') = \\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} + \\alpha\\boldsymbol{I}) $$\nBy the linearity of the trace operator, this becomes:\n$$ p' = \\frac{1}{3}(\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) + \\operatorname{tr}(\\alpha\\boldsymbol{I})) $$\nGiven that $\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = 3p$ and $\\operatorname{tr}(\\alpha\\boldsymbol{I}) = \\alpha\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{I}) = 3\\alpha$ for a three-dimensional space, we have:\n$$ p' = \\frac{1}{3}(3p + 3\\alpha) = p + \\alpha $$\nThe new deviatoric stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{s}'$, is by definition:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{s}' = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}' - p'\\boldsymbol{I} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'$ and $p'$ yields:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{s}' = (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} + \\alpha\\boldsymbol{I}) - (p + \\alpha)\\boldsymbol{I} $$\nExpanding the terms, we find:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{s}' = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} + \\alpha\\boldsymbol{I} - p\\boldsymbol{I} - \\alpha\\boldsymbol{I} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - p\\boldsymbol{I} $$\nThis result is precisely the definition of the original deviatoric stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{s}$. Thus, we have proven that\n$$ \\boldsymbol{s}' = \\boldsymbol{s} $$\nThe deviatoric stress tensor is invariant to the addition of a hydrostatic stress.\n\nFrom this invariance, it directly follows that the second invariant of the deviatoric stress, $J_{2}$, must also be invariant, as it is defined purely in terms of $\\boldsymbol{s}$:\n$$ J_{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\boldsymbol{s}:\\boldsymbol{s} $$\nwhere the double dot product $\\boldsymbol{s}:\\boldsymbol{s}$ for symmetric tensors corresponds to the sum of the squares of all components, $\\sum_{i,j} s_{ij}^2$. Since $\\boldsymbol{s}' = \\boldsymbol{s}$, it is self-evident that $J_{2}(\\boldsymbol{s}') = J_{2}(\\boldsymbol{s})$.\n\nSimilarly, the von Mises equivalent stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{eq}}$, is also invariant:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{eq}} = \\sqrt{3J_{2}} $$\nSince $J_{2}$ is invariant, $\\sigma_{\\text{eq}}$ must be as well.\n\nThe task is to verify this theoretical result numerically. The implementation will follow these steps:\n1.  For each test case, define the input stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ and the list of scalars $\\{\\alpha_k\\}$.\n2.  Implement a function to compute the deviatoric stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{s}$ from an input tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$. The calculation is $\\boldsymbol{s} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - (\\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}))\\boldsymbol{I}$.\n3.  Implement a function to compute $J_{2}$ from $\\boldsymbol{s}$. The calculation is $J_{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i,j}s_{ij}^2$.\n4.  Implement a function to compute $\\sigma_{\\text{eq}}$ from $J_{2}$. The calculation is $\\sigma_{\\text{eq}} = \\sqrt{3J_{2}}$.\n5.  For a given $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, compute the reference values $J_{2,\\text{ref}}$ and $\\sigma_{\\text{eq,ref}}$.\n6.  Iterate through each scalar $\\alpha_k$ in the provided list. For each $\\alpha_k$:\n    a. Construct the modified stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_k = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} + \\alpha_k\\boldsymbol{I}$.\n    b. Compute the new values $J_{2,k}$ and $\\sigma_{\\text{eq},k}$ from $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_k$.\n    c. Calculate the absolute deviations $|J_{2,k} - J_{2,\\text{ref}}|$ and $|\\sigma_{\\text{eq},k} - \\sigma_{\\text{eq,ref}}|$.\n7.  Find the maximum deviation across all $\\alpha_k$ for both $J_{2}$ and $\\sigma_{\\text{eq}}$.\n8.  Compare these maximum deviations against the specified tolerance $\\tau = 10^{-8}$. The test passes if and only if both maximum deviations are less than or equal to $\\tau$.\n\nThis procedure will be applied to each of the four test cases provided. Due to the limits of floating-point arithmetic, the calculated deviations are expected to be very small, non-zero numbers, which should fall below the given tolerance.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of verifying the invariance of J2 and von Mises stress\n    under the addition of hydrostatic stress.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        (\n            \"Test A\",\n            np.array([[100.0, 20.0, -10.0],\n                      [20.0, -50.0, 5.0],\n                      [-10.0, 5.0, 30.0]]),\n            [0.0, 15.0, -200.0, 1e6]\n        ),\n        (\n            \"Test B\",\n            123.45 * np.identity(3),\n            [0.0, -77.7, 9999.0]\n        ),\n        (\n            \"Test C\",\n            np.array([[2.0, 7.0, -3.0],\n                      [7.0, -1.0, 4.0],\n                      [-3.0, 4.0, -1.0]]),\n            [0.0, 3.7, -12.3, 1e6]\n        ),\n        (\n            \"Test D\",\n            np.array([[0.0, 50.0, 50.0],\n                      [50.0, 0.0, 50.0],\n                      [50.0, 50.0, 0.0]]),\n            [0.0, 1.0, -1.0, 1e6]\n        )\n    ]\n\n    TOLERANCE = 1e-8\n\n    def compute_deviatoric_stress(sigma: np.ndarray) - np.ndarray:\n        \"\"\"Computes the deviatoric stress tensor s from a Cauchy stress tensor sigma.\"\"\"\n        # p = 1/3 * tr(sigma)\n        hydrostatic_pressure = (1/3) * np.trace(sigma)\n        # s = sigma - p * I\n        s = sigma - hydrostatic_pressure * np.identity(3)\n        return s\n\n    def compute_j2(s: np.ndarray) - float:\n        \"\"\"Computes the second invariant of the deviatoric stress, J2.\"\"\"\n        # J2 = 1/2 * s:s = 1/2 * sum(s_ij * s_ij)\n        return 0.5 * np.sum(s**2)\n\n    def compute_von_mises(j2: float) - float:\n        \"\"\"Computes the von Mises equivalent stress.\"\"\"\n        # sigma_eq = sqrt(3 * J2)\n        # Handle the case where J2 is a very small negative number due to precision errors.\n        if j2  0:\n            return 0.0\n        return np.sqrt(3 * j2)\n\n    def verify_invariance(sigma: np.ndarray, alphas: list[float], tolerance: float) - bool:\n        \"\"\"\n        Verifies that J2 and sigma_eq are invariant for a given sigma and a list of alpha values.\n        Returns True if the maximum deviations are within tolerance, False otherwise.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Calculate reference values for the original stress tensor\n        s_ref = compute_deviatoric_stress(sigma)\n        j2_ref = compute_j2(s_ref)\n        sigma_eq_ref = compute_von_mises(j2_ref)\n\n        max_dev_j2 = 0.0\n        max_dev_sigma_eq = 0.0\n\n        for alpha in alphas:\n            # Create the new stress tensor: sigma' = sigma + alpha * I\n            sigma_new = sigma + alpha * np.identity(3)\n\n            # Calculate J2 and sigma_eq for the new tensor\n            s_new = compute_deviatoric_stress(sigma_new)\n            j2_new = compute_j2(s_new)\n            sigma_eq_new = compute_von_mises(j2_new)\n\n            # Calculate absolute deviations\n            dev_j2 = abs(j2_new - j2_ref)\n            dev_sigma_eq = abs(sigma_eq_new - sigma_eq_ref)\n\n            # Update maximum deviations\n            if dev_j2  max_dev_j2:\n                max_dev_j2 = dev_j2\n            if dev_sigma_eq  max_dev_sigma_eq:\n                max_dev_sigma_eq = dev_sigma_eq\n        \n        # Check if both max deviations are within the specified tolerance\n        return max_dev_j2 = tolerance and max_dev_sigma_eq = tolerance\n\n    results = []\n    for _, sigma, alphas in test_cases:\n        passed = verify_invariance(sigma, alphas, TOLERANCE)\n        results.append(passed)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2920803"}]}
