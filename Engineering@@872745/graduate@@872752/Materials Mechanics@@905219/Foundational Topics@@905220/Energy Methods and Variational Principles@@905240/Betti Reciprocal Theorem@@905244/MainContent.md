## Introduction
In physics, principles of reciprocity reveal profound symmetries between cause and effect. Within [solid mechanics](@entry_id:164042), the Betti Reciprocal Theorem stands as a cornerstone principle for linear elastic materials, establishing an elegant and powerful relationship between different loading scenarios applied to the same body. This theorem provides more than just theoretical insight; it is a practical tool that simplifies complex analyses and forms the basis for advanced computational methods. This article addresses the need for a systematic understanding of this theorem, from its fundamental derivation to its practical limitations. It will guide you through the core concepts, demonstrate their utility, and provide a framework for application.

This article is structured to build a comprehensive understanding of the Betti Reciprocal Theorem. First, the "Principles and Mechanisms" chapter will derive the theorem from first principles, uncovering its deep connection to material constitution and mathematical structure. Next, the "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" chapter will explore its vast utility, showcasing how it is applied in [structural analysis](@entry_id:153861), [fracture mechanics](@entry_id:141480), computational methods like the Boundary Element Method, and even fields like geophysics. Finally, the "Hands-On Practices" section offers concrete problems to solidify your knowledge, allowing you to directly verify the theorem, apply it in an adjoint method, and explore the consequences when its underlying assumptions are violated.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The principles of reciprocity in physics represent a profound statement about the symmetry of cause and effect. In the context of [solid mechanics](@entry_id:164042), the Betti Reciprocal Theorem provides a powerful and elegant expression of this symmetry for linear elastic bodies. This chapter will derive the theorem from fundamental principles, explore the critical role of material constitution in its validity, and examine its diverse applications and important limitations.

### The Foundational Principle: Reciprocity of Work

At its core, Betti's theorem establishes a relationship between two distinct, independent states of loading applied to the same elastic body. Let us consider a body subjected to a first set of forces ([body forces](@entry_id:174230) $\boldsymbol{b}^{(1)}$ and [surface tractions](@entry_id:169207) $\boldsymbol{t}^{(1)}$), which causes a [displacement field](@entry_id:141476) $\boldsymbol{u}^{(1)}$. Now, imagine a second, independent state where a different set of forces, $\boldsymbol{b}^{(2)}$ and $\boldsymbol{t}^{(2)}$, is applied to the *same* body, resulting in a displacement field $\boldsymbol{u}^{(2)}$.

Betti's reciprocal theorem states that the work done by the forces of the first state acting through the displacements of the second state is equal to the work done by the forces of the second state acting through the displacements of the first. This is a remarkable result, as it implies a [hidden symmetry](@entry_id:169281) in the response of the material, linking two otherwise unrelated loading scenarios.

### Derivation from First Principles: The Role of Material Symmetry

To understand the mechanism underlying this principle, we must derive it from the governing equations of [elastostatics](@entry_id:198298). For any static state $i$, the [equilibrium equation](@entry_id:749057) within the body's volume $\Omega$ is:
$$ \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}^{(i)} + \boldsymbol{b}^{(i)} = \boldsymbol{0} $$
where $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{(i)}$ is the Cauchy stress tensor and $\boldsymbol{b}^{(i)}$ is the [body force](@entry_id:184443) vector.

Let us begin with the [equilibrium equation](@entry_id:749057) for state 1, take its scalar product with the [displacement field](@entry_id:141476) from state 2, $\boldsymbol{u}^{(2)}$, and integrate over the volume $\Omega$:
$$ \int_{\Omega} (\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}^{(1)}) \cdot \boldsymbol{u}^{(2)} \, \mathrm{d}V + \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{b}^{(1)} \cdot \boldsymbol{u}^{(2)} \, \mathrm{d}V = 0 $$

Using the [product rule](@entry_id:144424) for divergence and the divergence theorem, the first term can be transformed. We know $(\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}^{(1)}) \cdot \boldsymbol{u}^{(2)} = \nabla \cdot (\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{(1)} \boldsymbol{u}^{(2)}) - \boldsymbol{\sigma}^{(1)} : \nabla \boldsymbol{u}^{(2)}$. Because the stress tensor $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{(1)}$ is symmetric (a consequence of the [balance of angular momentum](@entry_id:181848) in the absence of body couples), its contraction with the [displacement gradient](@entry_id:165352) $\nabla \boldsymbol{u}^{(2)}$ is equivalent to its contraction with the symmetric part of the gradient, which is the [small-strain tensor](@entry_id:754968) $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{(2)}$. Thus, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{(1)} : \nabla \boldsymbol{u}^{(2)} = \boldsymbol{\sigma}^{(1)} : \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{(2)}$. The [integral equation](@entry_id:165305) becomes:
$$ \int_{\partial \Omega} (\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{(1)}\boldsymbol{n}) \cdot \boldsymbol{u}^{(2)} \, \mathrm{d}S - \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{\sigma}^{(1)} : \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{(2)} \, \mathrm{d}V + \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{b}^{(1)} \cdot \boldsymbol{u}^{(2)} \, \mathrm{d}V = 0 $$
where $\boldsymbol{n}$ is the outward unit normal to the boundary $\partial \Omega$. Recognizing the traction vector as $\boldsymbol{t}^{(1)} = \boldsymbol{\sigma}^{(1)}\boldsymbol{n}$ on the boundary, we can rearrange this to state that the external work done by forces of state 1 on displacements of state 2 equals the internal "cross" work:
$$ \underbrace{\int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{b}^{(1)} \cdot \boldsymbol{u}^{(2)} \, \mathrm{d}V + \int_{\partial \Omega} \boldsymbol{t}^{(1)} \cdot \boldsymbol{u}^{(2)} \, \mathrm{d}S}_{\text{External Work } (1 \to 2)} = \underbrace{\int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{\sigma}^{(1)} : \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{(2)} \, \mathrm{d}V}_{\text{Internal Work } (1 \to 2)} $$

By simply swapping the indices 1 and 2, we can write the equivalent relation for the work done by the forces of state 2 on the displacements of state 1:
$$ \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{b}^{(2)} \cdot \boldsymbol{u}^{(1)} \, \mathrm{d}V + \int_{\partial \Omega} \boldsymbol{t}^{(2)} \cdot \boldsymbol{u}^{(1)} \, \mathrm{d}S = \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{\sigma}^{(2)} : \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{(1)} \, \mathrm{d}V $$

Betti's theorem is established if we can prove the equality of the two internal work terms. This is where the constitutive behavior of the material becomes paramount. For a linear elastic material, the stress is related to strain via the [fourth-order elasticity tensor](@entry_id:188318) $\mathsf{C}$: $\boldsymbol{\sigma} = \mathsf{C} : \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$. Substituting this into the internal work terms gives:
$$ \int_{\Omega} (\mathsf{C} : \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{(1)}) : \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{(2)} \, \mathrm{d}V \quad \text{and} \quad \int_{\Omega} (\mathsf{C} : \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{(2)}) : \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{(1)} \, \mathrm{d}V $$
In [index notation](@entry_id:191923), the integrands are $C_{ijkl} \varepsilon_{kl}^{(1)} \varepsilon_{ij}^{(2)}$ and $C_{ijkl} \varepsilon_{kl}^{(2)} \varepsilon_{ij}^{(1)}$. For these two integrals to be equal for any arbitrary strain fields, the [elasticity tensor](@entry_id:170728) must possess **[major symmetry](@entry_id:198487)**, that is, $C_{ijkl} = C_{klij}$ [@problem_id:2868450]. This symmetry allows us to swap the arguments in the [tensor contraction](@entry_id:193373): $(\mathsf{C} : \mathbf{A}) : \mathbf{B} = \mathbf{A} : (\mathsf{C} : \mathbf{B})$. Therefore, the internal work terms are indeed equal, $\int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{\sigma}^{(1)} : \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{(2)} \mathrm{d}V = \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{\sigma}^{(2)} : \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{(1)} \mathrm{d}V$.

This equality directly leads to the general statement of Betti's Reciprocal Theorem:
$$ \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{b}^{(1)} \cdot \boldsymbol{u}^{(2)} \, \mathrm{d}V + \int_{\partial \Omega} \boldsymbol{t}^{(1)} \cdot \boldsymbol{u}^{(2)} \, \mathrm{d}S = \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{b}^{(2)} \cdot \boldsymbol{u}^{(1)} \, \mathrm{d}V + \int_{\partial \Omega} \boldsymbol{t}^{(2)} \cdot \boldsymbol{u}^{(1)} \, \mathrm{d}S $$
This is the central result, valid for any linear elastic material possessing a fully symmetric elasticity tensor, under the assumption of small strains and displacements [@problem_id:2618399] [@problem_id:2868468]. The theorem holds for [anisotropic materials](@entry_id:184874) just as for isotropic ones, as long as the [major symmetry](@entry_id:198487) condition on $\mathsf{C}$ is met [@problem_id:2868475].

### The Hyperelastic Origin of Major Symmetry

The [major symmetry](@entry_id:198487) requirement, $C_{ijkl} = C_{klij}$, is not an arbitrary mathematical convenience. It has a deep physical origin in the thermodynamics of [reversible processes](@entry_id:276625). For an elastic material, the work done during deformation is stored as internal energy and can be fully recovered upon unloading. Such a material is termed **hyperelastic** (or Green-elastic), and its behavior can be described by a scalar **[strain energy density function](@entry_id:199500)**, $\psi(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon})$, from which the stress tensor can be derived:
$$ \sigma_{ij} = \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \varepsilon_{ij}} $$

For a linear elastic material, this energy density must be a quadratic function of the strain components: $\psi = \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_{ij} C_{ijkl} \varepsilon_{kl}$. If we now compute the stress components from this potential:
$$ \sigma_{ab} = \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \varepsilon_{ab}} = \frac{1}{2} (C_{abkl}\varepsilon_{kl} + C_{ijab}\varepsilon_{ij}) $$
Using the minor symmetries of $\mathsf{C}$ (i.e., $C_{ij..}=C_{ji..}$ and $C_{..kl}=C_{..lk}$) and renaming dummy indices, this becomes $\sigma_{ab} = \frac{1}{2} (C_{abkl} + C_{klab}) \varepsilon_{kl}$. For this to be consistent with the original constitutive law $\sigma_{ab} = C_{abkl} \varepsilon_{kl}$, it is necessary that $C_{abkl} = C_{klab}$—the [major symmetry](@entry_id:198487).

Alternatively, starting from $\sigma_{ij} = \partial \psi / \partial \varepsilon_{ij}$, we can define the components of the tangent elasticity tensor as $C_{ijkl} = \partial \sigma_{ij} / \partial \varepsilon_{kl}$. This yields:
$$ C_{ijkl} = \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial \varepsilon_{ij} \partial \varepsilon_{kl}} $$
If the [strain energy function](@entry_id:170590) is sufficiently smooth (twice continuously differentiable), the order of differentiation does not matter (Clairaut's theorem). Thus:
$$ C_{ijkl} = \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial \varepsilon_{ij} \partial \varepsilon_{kl}} = \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial \varepsilon_{kl} \partial \varepsilon_{ij}} = C_{klij} $$
This demonstrates unequivocally that the existence of a [strain energy potential](@entry_id:755493) is equivalent to the [major symmetry](@entry_id:198487) of the [elasticity tensor](@entry_id:170728) [@problem_id:2868450]. Betti's theorem is therefore a hallmark of conservative, linear elastic behavior.

### Mathematical Structure: Self-Adjointness

From a more abstract mathematical viewpoint, the [reciprocity theorem](@entry_id:267731) reflects the fact that the linear elasticity operator is **self-adjoint**. Consider the [differential operator](@entry_id:202628) $L(\boldsymbol{u}) = -\nabla \cdot (\mathsf{C} : \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\boldsymbol{u}))$, which maps a displacement field $\boldsymbol{u}$ to a body [force field](@entry_id:147325) $\boldsymbol{f}$. An operator is self-adjoint with respect to the standard $L^2$ inner product, $\langle \boldsymbol{u}, \boldsymbol{v} \rangle = \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{u} \cdot \boldsymbol{v} \, \mathrm{d}V$, if $\langle L(\boldsymbol{u}), \boldsymbol{v} \rangle = \langle \boldsymbol{u}, L(\boldsymbol{v}) \rangle$ for all suitable functions $\boldsymbol{u}$ and $\boldsymbol{v}$ (typically, those satisfying [homogeneous boundary conditions](@entry_id:750371)).

Following the same integration-by-parts procedure used in our derivation of Betti's theorem, we find:
$$ \langle L(\boldsymbol{u}), \boldsymbol{v} \rangle = \int_{\Omega} (-\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{u})) \cdot \boldsymbol{v} \, \mathrm{d}V = \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{u}) : \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\boldsymbol{v}) \, \mathrm{d}V = \int_{\Omega} (\mathsf{C}:\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\boldsymbol{u})) : \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\boldsymbol{v}) \, \mathrm{d}V $$
This final integral defines a [bilinear form](@entry_id:140194) $a(\boldsymbol{u}, \boldsymbol{v})$. The condition for self-adjointness, $\langle L(\boldsymbol{u}), \boldsymbol{v} \rangle = \langle \boldsymbol{u}, L(\boldsymbol{v}) \rangle$, becomes equivalent to the condition that this bilinear form is symmetric: $a(\boldsymbol{u}, \boldsymbol{v}) = a(\boldsymbol{v}, \boldsymbol{u})$. As we have seen, this symmetry is guaranteed if and only if $\mathsf{C}$ possesses [major symmetry](@entry_id:198487) [@problem_id:2618414]. This perspective connects Betti's theorem to the broader theory of [symmetric operators](@entry_id:272489) and [variational principles](@entry_id:198028) that form the foundation of the finite element method.

### Reciprocity in Discrete Systems: Maxwell's Theorem

The principle of reciprocity is not limited to [continuous bodies](@entry_id:168586). It has a powerful and intuitive counterpart for discrete structural systems like trusses and frames. For such systems, we consider generalized nodal forces $\mathbf{P}$ and corresponding generalized nodal displacements $\mathbf{u}$. For a linear elastic structure, these are related by the **flexibility matrix** $\mathbf{F}$ or the **[stiffness matrix](@entry_id:178659)** $\mathbf{K}$:
$$ \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{F} \mathbf{P} \quad \text{or} \quad \mathbf{P} = \mathbf{K} \mathbf{u} $$

In this discrete setting, Betti's theorem takes the form of an algebraic equality. For two load states $(\mathbf{P}^{(1)}, \mathbf{u}^{(1)})$ and $(\mathbf{P}^{(2)}, \mathbf{u}^{(2)})$, the reciprocity of work is expressed as:
$$ (\mathbf{P}^{(1)})^T \mathbf{u}^{(2)} = (\mathbf{P}^{(2)})^T \mathbf{u}^{(1)} $$
Substituting $\mathbf{u}^{(2)} = \mathbf{F} \mathbf{P}^{(2)}$ into the left side and $\mathbf{u}^{(1)} = \mathbf{F} \mathbf{P}^{(1)}$ into the right side reveals that this equality can only hold for arbitrary load vectors if the flexibility matrix is symmetric, $\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{F}^T$. Since $\mathbf{K} = \mathbf{F}^{-1}$, the [stiffness matrix](@entry_id:178659) must also be symmetric, $\mathbf{K} = \mathbf{K}^T$ [@problem_id:2868443].

This symmetry has a profound practical implication known as **Maxwell's Reciprocal Theorem**. Let $F_{ij}$ be the displacement at degree of freedom $i$ due to a unit force at degree of freedom $j$. The symmetry $F_{ij} = F_{ji}$ means that the displacement at $i$ due to a unit force at $j$ is identical to the displacement at $j$ due to a unit force at $i$. These terms, $F_{ij}$, are often called **influence coefficients**. Maxwell's theorem states that the matrix of influence coefficients is symmetric [@problem_id:2868475].

The continuum analogue of the influence coefficient is the **Green's function**, $G_{ij}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})$, which gives the displacement in the $i$-direction at point $\mathbf{x}$ due to a unit point force in the $j$-direction at point $\mathbf{y}$. A direct application of Betti's theorem to two states, each involving a single unit point force, shows that the Green's function must be symmetric in the following sense: $G_{ij}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = G_{ji}(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{x})$ [@problem_id:2868475].

### Applications and Extensions of Reciprocity

The Betti-Maxwell reciprocity theorems are more than theoretical curiosities; they are powerful tools for analysis and problem-solving.

#### Clapeyron's Theorem
A simple but important special case of Betti's theorem arises when we choose the two states to be identical, i.e., state 2 is the same as state 1. The [reciprocity relation](@entry_id:198404) becomes:
$$ \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{b}^{(1)} \cdot \boldsymbol{u}^{(1)} \, \mathrm{d}V + \int_{\partial \Omega} \boldsymbol{t}^{(1)} \cdot \boldsymbol{u}^{(1)} \, \mathrm{d}S = \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{\sigma}^{(1)} : \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{(1)} \, \mathrm{d}V $$
The left side is the total external work, $W_{ext}$. The term on the right is twice the elastic strain energy stored in the body, $U = \frac{1}{2} \int \boldsymbol{\sigma} : \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} \, \mathrm{d}V$. This gives **Clapeyron's Theorem**:
$$ W_{ext} = 2U $$
This states that for a linear elastic body, the external work done by the loads is twice the stored strain energy [@problem_id:2618399].

#### Reciprocity in Thermoelasticity
Betti's theorem can be extended to include non-mechanical effects like thermal expansion. For a thermoelastic material, the stress is given by $\boldsymbol{\sigma} = \mathsf{C} : (\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} - \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{th})$, where $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{th} = \alpha_T \Delta T \mathbf{I}$ is the [thermal strain](@entry_id:187744). A careful re-derivation leads to a generalized reciprocal theorem. One of its most useful forms relates a purely mechanical state (1) to a purely thermal state (2) where no external mechanical loads are applied ($\boldsymbol{b}^{(2)}=\mathbf{0}, \boldsymbol{t}^{(2)}=\mathbf{0}$). The theorem becomes:
$$ \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{b}^{(1)} \cdot \boldsymbol{u}^{(2)} \, \mathrm{d}V + \int_{\partial \Omega} \boldsymbol{t}^{(1)} \cdot \boldsymbol{u}^{(2)} \, \mathrm{d}S = - \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{\sigma}^{(1)} : \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{th,(2)} \, \mathrm{d}V $$
This allows one to calculate the work done by a mechanical load set on a thermally-induced [displacement field](@entry_id:141476) without ever solving the complex thermal stress problem. For instance, to find the work done by a uniform pressure $p$ acting on the change in shape of a body heated non-uniformly, we can use a simple mechanical state where $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{(1)}=-p\mathbf{I}$. The right-hand side becomes $\int_{\Omega} p \mathbf{I} : (\alpha_T \Delta T^{(2)} \mathbf{I}) \, dV = 3 p \alpha_T \int_{\Omega} \Delta T^{(2)} dV$. The total work is simply proportional to the average temperature change in the body, a result that is far from obvious but emerges directly from reciprocity [@problem_id:503696].

#### Reciprocity in Elastodynamics
The principle also extends to dynamic problems. For a body undergoing steady-state [harmonic motion](@entry_id:171819) at a frequency $\omega$, the governing equation for the complex amplitudes of displacement $(\hat{\boldsymbol{u}})$ and [body force](@entry_id:184443) $(\hat{\boldsymbol{b}})$ is $\nabla \cdot \hat{\boldsymbol{\sigma}} + \hat{\boldsymbol{b}} = -\rho \omega^2 \hat{\boldsymbol{u}}$, where $\rho$ is the mass density. The **Rayleigh-Carson reciprocal theorem** states that for an undamped or proportionally damped linear elastic system, reciprocity holds for the complex amplitudes. This means the associated receptance matrix $\mathbf{H}(\omega)$, which relates harmonic force inputs to harmonic displacement outputs, is symmetric [@problem_id:2868468] [@problem_id:2868475].

### The Boundaries of Reciprocity: When the Theorem Fails

Understanding the conditions under which a theorem holds is deepened by studying when it fails. Betti's theorem is predicated on the system being governed by a linear, self-adjoint operator, which physically corresponds to a [conservative system](@entry_id:165522). Violations of these conditions lead to a breakdown of reciprocity.

#### Non-Conservative Forces: Follower Loads
Forces whose direction or magnitude depends on the deformation of the body are known as **[follower forces](@entry_id:174748)**. A classic example is a force that always acts tangent to the deformed shape of a beam. Such forces are non-conservative; they cannot be derived from a [scalar potential](@entry_id:276177). When modeling such a system with the [finite element method](@entry_id:136884), the [linearization](@entry_id:267670) leads to a **non-symmetric tangent stiffness matrix**. Because the proof of discrete reciprocity relies on the symmetry of this matrix, the theorem fails for systems with [follower loads](@entry_id:171093) [@problem_id:2868465]. The asymmetry in the stiffness matrix is a direct mathematical manifestation of the non-conservative nature of the applied forces.

#### Non-Linear and Dissipative Boundaries: Contact and Friction
Boundary conditions themselves can violate the assumptions of the theorem. **Unilateral contact**, where a body can press against but not pull away from a rigid surface, introduces a fundamental non-linearity. The area of contact depends on the applied load, meaning the boundary conditions are solution-dependent. The [principle of superposition](@entry_id:148082) is lost, and Betti's theorem does not hold, even for frictionless contact, if the two load states produce different contact areas [@problem_id:2868464].

The introduction of **Coulomb friction** adds another violation: non-conservativity. The work done against friction is dissipated as heat and is path-dependent. Frictional forces are not derivable from a potential, leading to a non-symmetric response and a failure of reciprocity [@problem_id:2868464]. Only in the highly restrictive (and unrealistic) case where the contact area and stick/slip status are identical for both load states can reciprocity be recovered.

#### Path-Dependent Materials: Plasticity and Hypoelasticity
The most fundamental requirement for Betti's theorem is [linear elasticity](@entry_id:166983). For materials that exhibit path-dependent behavior, such as metals undergoing **plastic deformation**, the concept of a unique final state for a given final load is lost. The stress depends not just on the current strain, but on the entire history of loading. In this case, a global [reciprocity theorem](@entry_id:267731) is not possible.

However, an instantaneous or incremental form of reciprocity can be considered for two infinitesimal load perturbations about a given deformed state. This instantaneous reciprocity holds if and only if the **[consistent elastoplastic tangent operator](@entry_id:164527)**, $\mathbb{C}^{\text{ep}}$, is symmetric. Within the framework of "Generalized Standard Materials"—which includes most common [metal plasticity](@entry_id:176585) models with associative flow rules—this tangent operator is indeed symmetric. However, for materials described by **non-associative plasticity** (common in [geomechanics](@entry_id:175967)) or by certain **hypoelastic** models (using [objective stress rates](@entry_id:199282) not derivable from a potential), the tangent operator is non-symmetric, and even this instantaneous form of reciprocity is lost [@problem_id:2868440] [@problem_id:2868475]. The symmetry of the system's response is broken at the constitutive level, and the elegant symmetry of Betti's theorem no longer applies.
