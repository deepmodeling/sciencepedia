All concepts, such as torsional stiffness, polar second moment of area, and the thin-wall approximation, are standard in mechanics of materials. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary information (geometries, material property, constraint) to establish a mathematical relationship between the torsional stiffnesses of the two members. The question is unambiguous. A unique, meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, technical language, free of subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-posed, standard problem in solid mechanics. I will proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe torsional stiffness of a prismatic bar with a circular cross-section subjected to Saint-Venant torsion is given by the product $GJ$, where $G$ is the shear modulus of the material and $J$ is the polar second moment of area of the cross-section. Since both members are made of the same material, $G$ is identical for both. Therefore, to compare their torsional stiffness, we must compare their respective polar second moments of area, $J$.\n\nThe polar second moment of area, $J$, is defined by the integral over the cross-sectional area $A$:\n$$J = \\iint_A \\rho^2 \\,dA$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the radial distance from the centroidal axis of torsion. This definition highlights that area elements located farther from the centroid contribute more significantly to $J$, with a dependence on the square of the distance.\n\nLet us compute $J$ for each member.\n\n**Member 1: Solid Circular Bar**\nThe cross-section is a solid circle of radius $R_s$. In polar coordinates, the area element is $dA = \\rho \\,d\\rho \\,d\\phi$.\n$$J_{\\text{solid}} = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^{R_s} \\rho^2 (\\rho \\,d\\rho \\,d\\phi)$$\n$$J_{\\text{solid}} = 2\\pi \\int_0^{R_s} \\rho^3 \\,d\\rho = 2\\pi \\left[ \\frac{\\rho^4}{4} \\right]_0^{R_s} = \\frac{\\pi R_s^4}{2}$$\nThe area of the solid bar is $A_s = \\pi R_s^2$.\n\n**Member 2: Thin-Walled Circular Tube**\nThe cross-section is an annulus with mean radius $R$ and uniform thickness $t$. The problem gives the approximation $A_t \\approx 2\\pi R t$ based on the thin-wall assumption $t \\ll R$.\nWe can calculate $J_{\\text{tube}}$ by treating the entire area as being concentrated at the mean radius $R$, as the variation in $\\rho^2$ across the small thickness $t$ is negligible.\n$$J_{\\text{tube}} = \\iint_{A_t} \\rho^2 \\,dA \\approx R^2 \\iint_{A_t} dA = R^2 A_t$$\nSubstituting the expression for the area $A_t$:\n$$J_{\\text{tube}} \\approx R^2 (2\\pi R t) = 2\\pi R^3 t$$\n\n**Comparison under the Equal-Area Constraint**\nThe problem imposes the constraint $A_s = A_t$.\n$$\\pi R_s^2 = 2\\pi R t$$\nThis gives a relationship between the geometric parameters of the two members:\n$$R_s^2 = 2 R t$$\n\nNow, we will find the ratio of the polar second moments of area, $J_{\\text{tube}}/J_{\\text{solid}}$.\n$$\\frac{J_{\\text{tube}}}{J_{\\text{solid}}} = \\frac{2\\pi R^3 t}{\\frac{1}{2}\\pi R_s^4} = \\frac{4 R^3 t}{R_s^4}$$\nUsing the constraint $R_s^2 = 2 R t$, we can substitute for $t = R_s^2 / (2R)$:\n$$\\frac{J_{\\text{tube}}}{J_{\\text{solid}}} = \\frac{4 R^3 \\left( \\frac{R_s^2}{2R} \\right)}{R_s^4} = \\frac{2 R^2 R_s^2}{R_s^4} = 2 \\frac{R^2}{R_s^2} = 2 \\left( \\frac{R}{R_s} \\right)^2$$\nThis ratio determines which member is torsionally stiffer. A ratio greater than $1$ means the tube is stiffer, while a ratio less than $1$ means the solid bar is stiffer.\n\nThe condition for the tube to be stiffer is $J_{\\text{tube}} > J_{\\text{solid}}$, which implies:\n$$2 \\left( \\frac{R}{R_s} \\right)^2 > 1 \\implies \\left( \\frac{R}{R_s} \\right)^2 > \\frac{1}{2} \\implies R > \\frac{R_s}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nThe problem specifies that the tube is thin-walled, i.e., $t \\ll R$, or $t/R \\ll 1$. Let us examine what this condition implies for the ratio $R/R_s$. From the equal-area constraint, $t = R_s^2 / (2R)$.\n$$\\frac{t}{R} = \\frac{R_s^2 / (2R)}{R} = \\frac{R_s^2}{2R^2} \\ll 1$$\nThis means $2R^2 \\gg R_s^2$, or $R^2 \\gg R_s^2 / 2$. This condition is a much stronger requirement than $R^2 > R_s^2 / 2$. Therefore, for any cross-section that can be legitimately described as a \"thin-walled tube\" under the equal-area constraint, it is necessarily true that $R > R_s/\\sqrt{2}$, and in fact $R$ must be significantly larger. Consequently, a thin-walled tube with the same cross-sectional area as a solid bar is always torsionally stiffer.\n\nNow, we evaluate each of the provided options.\n\n**A. The solid bar is always torsionally stiffer for equal area because the material is contiguous across the section; removing the core (to form a tube) reduces $J$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The reasoning is flawed because the problem is not about removing material from a given bar but about comparing two different bars with equal area. By distributing the same amount of material at a larger radius, the polar second moment of area increases, as evidenced by the $\\rho^2$ term in its definition. Our derivation shows that for a thin-walled tube, $J_{\\text{tube}} > J_{\\text{solid}}$. **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. For equal area, a thin-walled circular tube is always stiffer than the solid bar regardless of its mean radius $R$, and the ratio $J_{\\text{tube}}/J_{\\text{solid}}$ is independent of $R$.**\nThe first part of the statement, that the tube is always stiffer, is correct. However, the second part is false. The ratio of stiffnesses is $2(R/R_s)^2$, which is explicitly dependent on the mean radius $R$ of the tube. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. For equal area, the torsional stiffnesses are equal because $J$ depends only on total area and not on its radial distribution.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The polar second moment of area, $J = \\iint \\rho^2 \\,dA$, is by definition a measure of how the area is distributed relative to the axis. Material located farther from the centroidal axis contributes disproportionately more to stiffness. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Under the equal-area constraint, a thin-walled circular tube of mean radius $R$ and thickness $t$ satisfies $A_t \\approx 2\\pi R t = \\pi R_s^2$, and the resulting polar second moment satisfies $J_{\\text{tube}}/J_{\\text{solid}} = 2\\,(R/R_s)^2$. Hence $J_{\\text{tube}} > J_{\\text{solid}}$ whenever $R > R_s/\\sqrt{2}$; in particular, any truly thin-walled tube (with $t/R \\ll 1$) is stiffer.**\nThis statement meticulously follows the correct derivation. It correctly states the equal-area constraint: $2\\pi R t = \\pi R_s^2$. It correctly states the ratio of the polar second moments of area: $J_{\\text{tube}}/J_{\\text{solid}} = 2(R/R_s)^2$. It correctly deduces the condition for the tube to be stiffer: $R > R_s/\\sqrt{2}$. Finally, it correctly connects this to the thin-wall assumption ($t/R \\ll 1$), showing that this assumption guarantees the condition for greater stiffness is met. The entire statement is a logically sound and complete summary of the analysis. **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2926971"}, {"introduction": "While the torsion formula works well for uniform shafts, many engineering components feature variable cross-sections.

This ratio is also known as the shape factor for the cross-section in torsion.\n\nFirst, we determine the torque at first yield, $T_y$. This calculation is based on the theory of linear elastic torsion.
