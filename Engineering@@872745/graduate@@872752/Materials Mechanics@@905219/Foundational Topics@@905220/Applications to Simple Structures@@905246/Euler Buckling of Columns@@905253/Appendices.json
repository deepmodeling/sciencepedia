The total potential energy, $\\Pi$, of an axially compressed column is the sum of the internal strain energy of bending, $U$, and the potential of the external axial load, $V$.\n\nThe strain energy of bending, assuming an Euler-Bernoulli beam where the bending moment $M(x) = EI \\kappa(x)$, is given by:\n$$\nU = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} M(x) \\kappa(x) \\,dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} EI (\\kappa(x))^2 \\,dx\n$$\nUsing the provided kinematic relation for small deflections, the curvature is $\\kappa(x) = -w''(x)$, where $w(x)$ is the lateral deflection and primes denote differentiation with respect to $x$.

The problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. Therefore, a reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation begins by considering the static equilibrium of the column in a slightly deflected configuration, described by the transverse displacement $w(x)$. An axial compressive force $P$ is applied at both ends. For a section of the column cut at an arbitrary position $x$ along its length, the internal bending moment $M(x)$ must balance the external moment produced by the axial force $P$ acting on the lever arm $w(x)$. By convention, a positive deflection $w(x)$ under a compressive force $P$ induces a negative internal bending moment.

For simplicity, we can set $C=1$ and work with the shape function $\\tilde{y}(x) = x^2(L-x)(1+\\alpha \\frac{x}{L})$.\nExpanding $\\tilde{y}(x)$:\n$$\\tilde{y}(x) = Lx^2 + (\\alpha - 1)x^3 - \\frac{\\alpha}{L}x^4$$\nWe require its first and second derivatives:\n$$\\tilde{y}'(x) = 2Lx + 3(\\alpha - 1)x^2 - \\frac{4\\alpha}{L}x^3$$\n$$\\tilde{y}''(x) = 2L + 6(\\alpha - 1)x - \\frac{12\\alpha}{L}x^2$$\nNext, we compute the two integrals in the Rayleigh quotient. Let the numerator integral be $N(\\alpha) = \\int_{0}^{L} (\\tilde{y}''(x))^2 dx$ and the denominator integral be $D(\\alpha) = \\int_{0}^{L} (\\tilde{y}'(x))^2 dx$.\n\nCalculation of the numerator integral $N(\\alpha)$:\n$$N(\\alpha) = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left( 2L + 6(\\alpha - 1)x - \\frac{12\\alpha}{L}x^2 \\right)^2 dx$$\nExpanding the integrand and integrating term by term yields:\n$N(\\alpha) = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left( 4L^2 + 36(\\alpha-1)^2 x^2 + \\frac{144\\alpha^2}{L^2}x^4 + 24L(\\alpha-1)x - 48\\alpha x^2 - \\frac{144\\alpha(\\alpha-1)}{L}x^3 \\right) dx$\n$N(\\alpha) = \\left[ 4L^2x + 12(\\alpha-1)^2 x^3 + \\frac{144\\alpha^2}{5L^2}x^5 + 12L(\\alpha-1)x^2 - 16\\alpha x^3 - \\frac{36\\alpha(\\alpha-1)}{L}x^4 \\right]_{0}^{L}$\n$N(\\alpha) = 4L^3 + 12(\\alpha-1)^2 L^3 + \\frac{144}{5}\\alpha^2 L^3 + 12(\\alpha-1)L^3 - 16\\alpha L^3 - 36\\alpha(\\alpha-1)L^3$\nFactoring out $L^3$ and collecting terms based on powers of $\\alpha$:\n$N(\\alpha) = L^3 \\left[ (12 - 36 + \\frac{144}{5})\\alpha^2 + (-24 + 12 - 16 + 36)\\alpha + (4 + 12 - 12) \\right]$\n$N(\\alpha) = L^3 \\left( \\frac{24}{5}\\alpha^2 + 8\\alpha + 4 \\right) = \\frac{4L^3}{5}(6\\alpha^2 + 10\\alpha + 5)$\n\nCalculation of the denominator integral $D(\\alpha)$:\n$$D(\\alpha) = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left( 2Lx + 3(\\alpha - 1)x^2 - \\frac{4\\alpha}{L}x^3 \\right)^2 dx$$\nExpanding and integrating:\n$D(\\alpha) = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left( 4L^2x^2 + 9(\\alpha-1)^2x^4 + \\frac{16\\alpha^2}{L^2}x^6 + 12L(\\alpha-1)x^3 - 16\\alpha x^4 - \\frac{24\\alpha(\\alpha-1)}{L}x^5 \\right) dx$\n$D(\\alpha) = \\left[ \\frac{4}{3}L^2x^3 + \\frac{9}{5}(\\alpha-1)^2x^5 + \\frac{16}{7L^2}\\alpha^2x^7 + 3L(\\alpha-1)x^4 - \\frac{16}{5}\\alpha x^5 - \\frac{4\\alpha(\\alpha-1)}{L}x^6 \\right]_{0}^{L}$\n$D(\\alpha) = \\frac{4}{3}L^5 + \\frac{9}{5}(\\alpha-1)^2 L^5 + \\frac{16}{7}\\alpha^2 L^5 + 3(\\alpha-1)L^5 - \\frac{16}{5}\\alpha L^5 - 4\\alpha(\\alpha-1)L^5$\nFactoring out $L^5$ and collecting terms based on powers of $\\alpha$:\n$D(\\alpha) = L^5 \\left[ (\\frac{9}{5} - 4 + \\frac{16}{7})\\alpha^2 + (-\\frac{18}{5} + 3 - \\frac{16}{5} + 4)\\alpha + (\\frac{4}{3} + \\frac{9}{5} - 3) \\right]$\n$D(\\alpha) = L^5 \\left( \\frac{3}{35}\\alpha^2 + \\frac{1}{5}\\alpha + \\frac{2}{15} \\right) = \\frac{L^5}{105}(9\\alpha^2 + 21\\alpha + 14)$\n\nThe Rayleigh quotient as a function of $\\alpha$ is:\n$$R(\\alpha) = EI \\frac{N(\\alpha)}{D(\\alpha)} = EI \\frac{\\frac{4L^3}{5}(6\\alpha^2 + 10\\alpha + 5)}{\\frac{L^5}{105}(9\\alpha^2 + 21\\alpha + 14)} = \\frac{84 EI}{L^2} \\frac{6\\alpha^2 + 10\\alpha + 5}{9\\alpha^2 + 21\\alpha + 14}$$\nTo find the tightest upper bound, we must minimize $R(\\alpha)$ with respect to $\\alpha$. This is equivalent to minimizing the fraction $f(\\alpha) = \\frac{u(\\alpha)}{v(\\alpha)} = \\frac{6\\alpha^2 + 10\\alpha + 5}{9\\alpha^2 + 21\\alpha + 14}$. We set the derivative $\\frac{df}{d\\alpha}$ to zero.\n$$\\frac{df}{d\\alpha} = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2} = 0 \\implies u'v - uv' = 0$$\nwhere $u'(\\alpha) = 12\\alpha + 10$ and $v'(\\alpha) = 18\\alpha + 21$.\nThe condition is:\n$$(12\\alpha + 10)(9\\alpha^2 + 21\\alpha + 14) - (6\\alpha^2 + 10\\alpha + 5)(18\\alpha + 21) = 0$$\nExpanding both terms:\n$(108\\alpha^3 + 342\\alpha^2 + 378\\alpha + 140) - (108\\alpha^3 + 306\\alpha^2 + 300\\alpha + 105) = 0$\n$$(342-306)\\alpha^2 + (378-300)\\alpha + (140-105) = 0$$\n$$36\\alpha^2 + 78\\alpha + 35 = 0$$\nThe roots of this quadratic equation are found using the quadratic formula:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{-78 \\pm \\sqrt{78^2 - 4(36)(35)}}{2(36)} = \\frac{-78 \\pm \\sqrt{6084 - 5040}}{72} = \\frac{-78 \\pm \\sqrt{1044}}{72}$$\nThe discriminant simplifies as $\\sqrt{1044} = \\sqrt{36 \\times 29} = 6\\sqrt{29}$.\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{-78 \\pm 6\\sqrt{29}}{72} = \\frac{-13 \\pm \\sqrt{29}}{12}$$\nAt an extremum, the value of the quotient $f(\\alpha) = \\frac{u(\\alpha)}{v(\\alpha)}$ is equal to $\\frac{u'(\\alpha)}{v'(\\alpha)}$.\n$$f(\\alpha_{opt}) = \\frac{12\\alpha + 10}{18\\alpha + 21} = \\frac{2(6\\alpha + 5)}{3(6\\alpha + 7)}$$\nWe substitute the two roots for $\\alpha$ into this expression.

Since $\\sqrt{29}  1$, both are positive.
