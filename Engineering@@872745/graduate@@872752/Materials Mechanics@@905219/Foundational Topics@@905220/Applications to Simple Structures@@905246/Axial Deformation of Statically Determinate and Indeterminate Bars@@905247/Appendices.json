It is scientifically grounded, free of contradictions, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, I will proceed with its resolution.\n\nThis problem must be analyzed using the fundamental principles of solid mechanics: equilibrium of forces, compatibility of displacements, and the constitutive law for linear thermoelastic materials.\n\nLet the subscripts $s$, $a$, and $t$ denote the steel core, aluminum sleeve, and titanium rod, respectively. The axial forces in these members are denoted by $F_s$, $F_a$, and $F_t$, with tension defined as positive. The total axial deformations are $\\delta_s$, $\\delta_a$, and $\\delta_t$.\n\nFirst, we establish the equilibrium equation by considering the free-body diagram of the rigid, massless ring that connects the left and right spans. The sum of axial forces acting on the ring must be zero. The total force from the left composite member (steel and aluminum) must balance the force from the right titanium member.\n$$F_s + F_a = F_t \\quad (1)$$\n\nNext, we establish the compatibility equations based on the geometric constraints of the assembly.\n1.  The steel core and aluminum sleeve form a composite member of length $L_1$. They are perfectly bonded between the left rigid wall and the rigid ring. Therefore, their axial deformations must be identical. Let $\\delta_1$ be the deformation of this left span.\n$$\\delta_s = \\delta_a = \\delta_1 \\quad (2)$$\n2.  The entire assembly is fixed between two immovable walls. This means the total change in length of the assembly must be zero. The deformation of the left span, $\\delta_1$, plus the deformation of the right span, $\\delta_2 = \\delta_t$, must sum to zero.\n$$\\delta_1 + \\delta_t = 0 \\quad (3)$$\nSince $\\delta_1 = \\delta_s = \\delta_a$, we can write this condition using any of the left members. For instance:\n$$\\delta_s + \\delta_t = 0$$\n\nFinally, we introduce the constitutive relations for one-dimensional thermoelastic behavior. The total deformation $\\delta$ of a prismatic bar is the sum of the mechanical deformation due to an axial force $F$ and the thermal deformation due to a temperature change $\\Delta T$.\n$$\\delta = \\frac{FL}{AE} + \\alpha (\\Delta T) L$$\nApplying this to each component:\n-   Steel core ($\\Delta T_s = 0$): $\\delta_s = \\frac{F_s L_1}{A_s E_s}$\n-   Aluminum sleeve ($\\Delta T_a = 60\\,\\mathrm{K}$): $\\delta_a = \\frac{F_a L_1}{A_a E_a} + \\alpha_a (\\Delta T_a) L_1$\n-   Titanium rod ($\\Delta T_t = 0$): $\\delta_t = \\frac{F_t L_2}{A_t E_t}$\n\nWe now have a system of equations to solve for the unknown forces $F_s$, $F_a$, and $F_t$.\nFrom compatibility condition (2), $\\delta_s = \\delta_a$:\n$$\\frac{F_s L_1}{A_s E_s} = \\frac{F_a L_1}{A_a E_a} + \\alpha_a (\\Delta T_a) L_1$$\nDividing by $L_1$ (since $L_1 \\neq 0$):\n$$\\frac{F_s}{A_s E_s} = \\frac{F_a}{A_a E_a} + \\alpha_a \\Delta T_a \\quad (4)$$\nFrom compatibility condition (3), $\\delta_s + \\delta_t = 0$:\n$$\\frac{F_s L_1}{A_s E_s} + \\frac{F_t L_2}{A_t E_t} = 0$$\nFrom this, we express $F_s$ in terms of $F_t$:\n$$F_s = -F_t \\frac{L_2 A_s E_s}{L_1 A_t E_t} \\quad (5)$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $F_s$ into equation (4):\n$$\\frac{1}{A_s E_s} \\left( -F_t \\frac{L_2 A_s E_s}{L_1 A_t E_t} \\right) = \\frac{F_a}{A_a E_a} + \\alpha_a \\Delta T_a$$\n$$-F_t \\frac{L_2}{L_1 A_t E_t} = \\frac{F_a}{A_a E_a} + \\alpha_a \\Delta T_a$$\nFrom this, we express $F_a$ in terms of $F_t$:\n$$F_a = -F_t \\frac{L_2 A_a E_a}{L_1 A_t E_t} - A_a E_a \\alpha_a \\Delta T_a \\quad (6)$$\nWe have now expressed both $F_s$ and $F_a$ in terms of our target unknown, $F_t$.

We proceed to the solution.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe solution is constructed from the governing principles of 1D continuum mechanics for a thermoelastic solid.\n\n**1. Determination of Axial Stress $\\sigma(x)$**\n\nThe solution requires satisfying equilibrium, kinematics, and the constitutive relation simultaneously, subject to the boundary conditions.\n\n-   **Equilibrium:** For a 1D bar with no distributed body forces, the axial force $N(x)$ must be constant along its length. The equilibrium equation $\\frac{dN}{dx}=0$ implies $N(x) = N_0$, where $N_0$ is a constant. The axial force is related to the axial stress $\\sigma(x)$ and cross-sectional area $A(x)$ by $N(x) = \\sigma(x) A(x)$. Therefore, we have:\n    $$ \\sigma(x) A(x) = N_0 $$\n    From this, we express the stress as a function of the unknown reaction force $N_0$:\n    $$ \\sigma(x) = \\frac{N_0}{A(x)} = \\frac{N_0}{A_{0}\\left(1 + \\gamma \\frac{x}{L}\\right)} $$\n\n-   **Kinematics and Constitutive Law:** The total axial strain $\\varepsilon(x)$ is the sum of the mechanical strain $\\varepsilon_m(x)$ and the thermal strain $\\varepsilon_T(x)$.\n    $$ \\varepsilon(x) = \\varepsilon_m(x) + \\varepsilon_T(x) $$\n    For a linear elastic material, the mechanical strain is given by Hooke's Law, $\\varepsilon_m(x) = \\frac{\\sigma(x)}{E}$. The thermal strain is $\\varepsilon_T(x) = \\alpha \\Delta T(x)$. Combining these yields the linear thermoelastic constitutive relation:\n    $$ \\varepsilon(x) = \\frac{\\sigma(x)}{E} + \\alpha \\Delta T(x) $$\n    The strain is also related to the axial displacement $u(x)$ through the kinematic relation $\\varepsilon(x) = \\frac{du}{dx}$.\n\n-   **Compatibility:** The boundary conditions are $u(0)=0$ and $u(L)=0$. The total change in length of the bar is the integral of the strain over its length:\n    $$ u(L) - u(0) = \\int_0^L \\varepsilon(x) dx $$\n    Given the clamped ends, this change must be zero:\n    $$ \\int_0^L \\varepsilon(x) dx = 0 $$\n    We substitute the constitutive and equilibrium relations into this compatibility equation to solve for the unknown force $N_0$:\n    $$ \\int_0^L \\left(\\frac{\\sigma(x)}{E} + \\alpha \\Delta T(x)\\right) dx = 0 $$\n    $$ \\int_0^L \\left(\\frac{N_0}{E A(x)} + \\alpha \\Delta T(x)\\right) dx = 0 $$\n    $$ \\frac{N_0}{E} \\int_0^L \\frac{dx}{A(x)} + \\alpha \\int_0^L \\Delta T(x) dx = 0 $$\n    We evaluate the two integrals. The first integral is:\n    $$ \\int_0^L \\frac{dx}{A(x)} = \\int_0^L \\frac{dx}{A_0\\left(1 + \\gamma \\frac{x}{L}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{A_0} \\left[ \\frac{L}{\\gamma} \\ln\\left(1 + \\gamma \\frac{x}{L}\\right) \\right]_0^L = \\frac{L}{A_0\\gamma} \\ln(1+\\gamma) $$\n    This expression is valid for $\\gamma \\neq 0$. In the limit $\\gamma \\to 0$, $\\frac{\\ln(1+\\gamma)}{\\gamma} \\to 1$, so the integral becomes $\\frac{L}{A_0}$, which is correct for a prismatic bar.\n    The second integral is:\n    $$ \\int_0^L \\Delta T(x) dx = \\int_0^L \\left(T_c + T_g \\frac{x}{L}\\right) dx = \\left[ T_c x + \\frac{T_g x^2}{2L} \\right]_0^L = T_c L + \\frac{T_g L}{2} = L\\left(T_c + \\frac{T_g}{2}\\right) $$\n    Substituting these results into the compatibility equation:\n    $$ \\frac{N_0}{E} \\left(\\frac{L}{A_0\\gamma} \\ln(1+\\gamma)\\right) + \\alpha L\\left(T_c + \\frac{T_g}{2}\\right) = 0 $$\n    Solving for $N_0$:\n    $$ N_0 = - \\frac{E A_0 \\alpha \\gamma \\left(T_c + \\frac{T_g}{2}\\right)}{\\ln(1+\\gamma)} $$\n    Finally, the axial stress $\\sigma(x)$ is:\n    $$ \\sigma(x) = \\frac{N_0}{A(x)} = - \\frac{E \\alpha \\gamma \\left(T_c + \\frac{T_g}{2}\\right)}{\\ln(1+\\gamma)} \\frac{1}{1 + \\gamma \\frac{x}{L}} $$\n\n**2. Strain Energy Density $\\psi(x)$**\n\nThe strain energy density function $\\psi$ in an elastic material represents the recoverable mechanical work done per unit volume. It is a function of the state of strain. For a thermoelastic material, this energy is stored only in the mechanical part of the deformation, not the thermal expansion part. The definition from first principles is the work done by the stress on the mechanical strain:\n$$ \\psi = \\int_0^{\\varepsilon_m} \\sigma(\\varepsilon'_m) d\\varepsilon'_m $$\nFor a linear elastic material, $\\sigma = E \\varepsilon_m$. Substituting this gives:\n$$ \\psi = \\int_0^{\\varepsilon_m} E \\varepsilon'_m d\\varepsilon'_m = \\frac{1}{2} E (\\varepsilon_m)^2 $$\nUsing the constitutive relation $\\varepsilon_m = \\sigma/E$, we can express the strain energy density in terms of stress, which is more convenient here:\n$$ \\psi(x) = \\frac{\\sigma(x)^2}{2E} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\sigma(x)$:\n$$ \\psi(x) = \\frac{1}{2E} \\left( - \\frac{E \\alpha \\gamma \\left(T_c + \\frac{T_g}{2}\\right)}{\\ln(1+\\gamma)} \\frac{1}{1 + \\gamma \\frac{x}{L}} \\right)^2 $$\n$$ \\psi(x) = \\frac{E \\alpha^2 \\gamma^2 \\left(T_c + \\frac{T_g}{2}\\right)^2}{2\\left(\\ln(1+\\gamma)\\right)^2} \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\gamma \\frac{x}{L}\\right)^2} $$\n\n**3. Total Stored Elastic Energy $U$**\n\nThe total stored elastic energy $U$ is the integral of the strain energy density $\\psi(x)$ over the entire volume $V$ of the bar. The differential volume element is $dV = A(x) dx$.\n$$ U = \\int_V \\psi(x) dV = \\int_0^L \\psi(x) A(x) dx $$\nAn alternative and more direct calculation for $U$ is as follows:\n$$ U = \\int_0^L \\frac{\\sigma(x)^2}{2E} A(x) dx = \\int_0^L \\frac{1}{2E} \\left(\\frac{N_0}{A(x)}\\right)^2 A(x) dx = \\frac{N_0^2}{2E} \\int_0^L \\frac{dx}{A(x)} $$\nWe have already computed the integral $\\int_0^L \\frac{dx}{A(x)} = \\frac{L}{A_0\\gamma} \\ln(1+\\gamma)$.\nWe now substitute the expressions for $N_0^2$ and the integral:\n$$ N_0^2 = \\left( - \\frac{E A_0 \\alpha \\gamma \\left(T_c + \\frac{T_g}{2}\\right)}{\\ln(1+\\gamma)} \\right)^2 = \\frac{E^2 A_0^2 \\alpha^2 \\gamma^2 \\left(T_c + \\frac{T_g}{2}\\right)^2}{\\left(\\ln(1+\\gamma)\\right)^2} $$\n$$ U = \\frac{1}{2E} \\left( \\frac{E^2 A_0^2 \\alpha^2 \\gamma^2 \\left(T_c + \\frac{T_g}{2}\\right)^2}{\\left(\\ln(1+\\gamma)\\right)^2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{L}{A_0\\gamma} \\ln(1+\\gamma) \\right) $$\nSimplifying this expression by cancelling terms:\n$$ U = \\frac{E A_0 \\alpha^2 \\gamma L \\left(T_c + \\frac{T_g}{2}\\right)^2}{2\\ln(1+\\gamma)} $$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the total stored elastic energy in the bar.

We apply this to the expression for $u'(x)$:\n$$E \\left(-\\frac{b}{E} L + C_1\\right) = \\bar{t}_L$$\n$$-bL + E C_1 = \\bar{t}_L$$\nFrom this, we find the expression for the term $E C_1$:\n$$E C_1 = \\bar{t}_L + bL$$\nNote that this term is precisely the axial stress at $x=0$, since $\\sigma(0) = E u'(0) = E C_1$. Thus, the reaction stress at the support is $\\sigma(0) = \\bar{t}_L + bL$. This is a result of static equilibrium, independent of material properties.\n\n$2$. At $x=0$, the Robin boundary condition is given:\n$$-\\sigma(0) + \\alpha \\big(u(0)-u_D\\big) = 0$$\nFrom the general solution, we have $u(0) = C_2$. Substituting the known expressions for $\\sigma(0)$ and $u(0)$:\n$$-(\\bar{t}_L + bL) + \\alpha(C_2 - u_D) = 0$$\nWe solve for the integration constant $C_2$:\n$$\\alpha(C_2 - u_D) = \\bar{t}_L + bL$$\n$$C_2 = u_D + \\frac{\\bar{t}_L + bL}{\\alpha}$$\n\nThe complete solution for the displacement field $u(x)$ is found by substituting the expressions for $C_1 = \\frac{\\bar{t}_L + bL}{E}$ and $C_2$ back into the general solution:\n$$u(x) = -\\frac{b}{2E} x^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\bar{t}_L + bL}{E}\\right)x + u_D + \\frac{\\bar{t}_L + bL}{\\alpha}$$\n\nTo justify the interpretation of the Robin condition as a penalty method for the Dirichlet condition $u(0)=u_D$, we examine the behavior of $u(0)$ in the limit as $\\alpha \\to \\infty$. The displacement at $x=0$ is $u(0) = C_2$.\n$$u(0) = u_D + \\frac{\\bar{t}_L + bL}{\\alpha}$$\nTaking the limit:\n$$\\lim_{\\alpha \\to \\infty} u(0) = \\lim_{\\alpha \\to \\infty} \\left(u_D + \\frac{\\bar{t}_L + bL}{\\alpha}\\right) = u_D$$\nAs $\\alpha$ increases, the displacement $u(0)$ is driven towards the value $u_D$. An infinitely large $\\alpha$ corresponds to an infinitely stiff penalty, which perfectly enforces the condition $u(0) = u_D$.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the boundary displacement error, which is $u(0)-u_D$. Using the expression for $u(0)$ derived above:\n$$u(0) - u_D = \\left(u_D + \\frac{\\bar{t}_L + bL}{\\alpha}\\right) - u_D$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the error:\n$$u(0) - u_D = \\frac{\\bar{t}_L + bL}{\\alpha}$$\nThis expression is a function of $\\bar{t}_L$, $b$, $L$, and $\\alpha$. It is independent of the Young's modulus $E$ because the error is directly proportional to the reaction stress $\\sigma(0)$, which is statically determinate from equilibrium considerations alone.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{bL + \\bar{t}_L}{\\alpha}}$$", "id": "2706162"}]}
