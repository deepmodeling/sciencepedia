We shall proceed.\n\nThe task is to derive the effective Young's modulus for a two-phase composite under isostrain conditions, which is characteristic of the Voigt model. The derivation must start from fundamental definitions.\n\nLet $\\langle \\sigma \\rangle$ be the macroscopic (volume-averaged) stress and $\\langle \\varepsilon \\rangle$ be the macroscopic (volume-averaged) strain for the composite, which is treated as a homogeneous effective medium. The effective Young's modulus, which we will denote as $E_V$ for the Voigt model, is defined by the macroscopic constitutive law:\n$$ \\langle \\sigma \\rangle = E_V \\langle \\varepsilon \\rangle $$\n\nThe problem specifies that the macroscopic stress is the volume-fraction weighted average of the stresses in the individual phases, $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$:\n$$ \\langle \\sigma \\rangle = v_1 \\sigma_1 + v_2 \\sigma_2 $$\nwhere $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the volume fractions of phase $1$ and phase $2$, respectively.\n\nThe critical assumption provided is the isostrain condition, which states that the strain is uniform throughout the composite. This idealization corresponds to a parallel arrangement of the phases with respect to the loading axis. Mathematically, this means the strain in phase $1$ ($\\varepsilon_1$) and the strain in phase $2$ ($\\varepsilon_2$) are equal to each other and to the macroscopic strain $\\langle \\varepsilon \\rangle$:\n$$ \\langle \\varepsilon \\rangle = \\varepsilon_1 = \\varepsilon_2 $$\n\nEach phase is a linear elastic solid, so its behavior is governed by Hooke's law for uniaxial stress:\n$$ \\sigma_1 = E_1 \\varepsilon_1 $$\n$$ \\sigma_2 = E_2 \\varepsilon_2 $$\nwhere $E_1$ and $E_2$ are the Young's moduli of the respective phases.\n\nWe now substitute the phase-level Hooke's law into the expression for the macroscopic stress:\n$$ \\langle \\sigma \\rangle = v_1 (E_1 \\varepsilon_1) + v_2 (E_2 \\varepsilon_2) $$\n\nNext, we apply the isostrain condition, replacing $\\varepsilon_1$ and $\\varepsilon_2$ with the macroscopic strain $\\langle \\varepsilon \\rangle$:\n$$ \\langle \\sigma \\rangle = v_1 E_1 \\langle \\varepsilon \\rangle + v_2 E_2 \\langle \\varepsilon \\rangle $$\n\nFactoring out the macroscopic strain $\\langle \\varepsilon \\rangle$ from the right-hand side gives:\n$$ \\langle \\sigma \\rangle = (v_1 E_1 + v_2 E_2) \\langle \\varepsilon \\rangle $$\n\nBy comparing this derived expression with the definition of the effective modulus, $\\langle \\sigma \\rangle = E_V \\langle \\varepsilon \\rangle$, we can identify the expression for the Voigt effective modulus:\n$$ E_V = v_1 E_1 + v_2 E_2 $$\nThis is the rule of mixtures, representing the Voigt upper bound for the effective Young's modulus.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically using the given data:\n$E_1 = 200\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$\n$E_2 = 3\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$\n$v_1 = 0.6$\n\nThe volume fraction of phase $2$ is $v_2 = 1 - v_1$:\n$$ v_2 = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4 $$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula for $E_V$:\n$$ E_V = (0.6)(200\\,\\mathrm{GPa}) + (0.4)(3\\,\\mathrm{GPa}) $$\n$$ E_V = 120\\,\\mathrm{GPa} + 1.2\\,\\mathrm{GPa} $$\n$$ E_V = 121.2\\,\\mathrm{GPa} $$\nThe result is required to four significant figures, which $121.2$ already satisfies.\n\nFinally, we must explain the implication for load sharing.

They represent a rule of mixtures for compliance and are an underestimate because they do not enforce strain compatibility, leading to gaps or overlaps between phases in the deformed state.\n\n**3. Physical Implications**\n\nThe derivation shows that for any non-zero porosity $\\phi > 0$, the Reuss lower bounds for both bulk and shear moduli are exactly zero. Mechanically, the isostress assumption implies that the applied load is partitioned equally as stress across both the solid matrix and the void phase. Since a void cannot sustain any stress ($K_2=0, G_2=0$), it must deform infinitely to satisfy the constitutive relation $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_2 = \\mathbf{C}_2 \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_2$ for any non-zero $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_2$. By averaging, this infinite local deformation leads to an infinite macroscopic deformation, which corresponds to zero effective stiffness for the composite.\n\nThis result highlights a critical deficiency of the Reuss model for porous materials. The model is equivalent to a 'series' mechanical arrangement. The presence of even a minuscule fraction of a phase with zero stiffness (infinite compliance) in this series arrangement creates a path of infinite compliance for the entire structure, causing its overall stiffness to vanish.\n\nIn reality, for a material with isolated pores, the stress is not uniform; it concentrates in the solid matrix surrounding the voids. The solid matrix provides structural integrity, and the effective stiffness is finite and non-zero. The Reuss bound is thus mathematically correct under its strict assumption, but physically uninformative as a practical lower limit. It only becomes physically relevant in the limiting case where the porosity $\\phi$ is high enough for the voids to form a continuous, percolating network through the RVE, which would indeed cause a loss of structural integrity and a drop in stiffness to zero. For non-percolating porosity, more restrictive bounds like the Hashin-Shtrikman bounds are required to provide a meaningful, non-zero lower bound.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n(1-\\phi) K_s & 0 & (1-\\phi) G_s & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2915423"}]}
