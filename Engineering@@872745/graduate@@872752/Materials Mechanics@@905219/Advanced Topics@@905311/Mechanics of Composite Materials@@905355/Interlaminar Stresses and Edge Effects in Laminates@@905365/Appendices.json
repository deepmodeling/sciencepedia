These stresses are not arbitrary; they arise from the fundamental requirement of three-dimensional equilibrium at locations where the assumptions of 2D plate theory break down.

By comparing two laminates that are identical in every way except for their in-plane Poisson's ratio $\\nu_{12}$, you will develop a clear intuition for how differing lateral contractions under axial load generate the internal transverse stresses that ultimately give rise to peeling stresses ($\\sigma_{zz}$) at a free edge [@problem_id:2894711].", "problem": "A long, wide, symmetric cross-ply laminate of stacking sequence $\\left[0/90\\right]_s$ and total thickness $h=4t$ is loaded in uniform in-plane tension by a resultant $N_x$ (force per unit width) along the $x$-direction.

Therefore, material B with $\\nu_{12}=\\;0.45\\;$ produces the higher peak free-edge $\\sigma_{zz}$.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n- A. Correct. Higher $\\nu_{12}$ increases $Q_{12}$, increases the interior Poisson-driven $\\sigma_{yy}$ mismatch between $0^\\circ$ and $90^\\circ$ plies, and thus increases the edge-relaxation demand that generates larger $\\tau_{yz}$ and $\\sigma_{zz}$ peaks.\n- B. Incorrect. Lower $\\nu_{12}$ reduces the Poisson coupling and the interior $\\sigma_{yy}$ levels, thereby reducing the driver for edge interlaminar stresses, not increasing them.\n- C. Incorrect. Identical in-plane moduli do not guarantee identical edge effects; the Poisson coupling $Q_{12}$ depends on $\\nu_{12}$ and directly controls the transverse stress fields that feed the edge boundary layer.\n- D.

A more direct way to assess the driving force for these stresses is to consider the mismatch of the in-plane stresses ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\tau_{xy}$) between adjacent plies.\n\nAccording to CLT, for a laminate under in-plane loads, the mid-plane strains $\\{\\varepsilon^0\\}$ are uniform through the thickness. The stress in an individual ply $k$ is given in global coordinates by $\\{\\sigma\\}^{(k)} = [\\bar{Q}]^{(k)}\\{\\varepsilon^0\\}$.

Substituting this into the ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_{xz,\\max}}{N_x/h} = \\frac{(\\pi/h) h}{4} \\frac{Q_{11} - Q_{22}}{Q_{11} + Q_{22}} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\frac{Q_{11} - Q_{22}}{Q_{11} + Q_{22}}\n$$\nThe stiffness ratio can be simplified by substituting the definitions of $Q_{11}$ and $Q_{22}$:\n$$\n\\frac{Q_{11} - Q_{22}}{Q_{11} + Q_{22}} = \\frac{\\frac{E_1}{1 - \\nu_{12}\\nu_{21}} - \\frac{E_2}{1 - \\nu_{12}\\nu_{21}}}{\\frac{E_1}{1 - \\nu_{12}\\nu_{21}} + \\frac{E_2}{1 - \\nu_{12}\\nu_{21}}} = \\frac{E_1 - E_2}{E_1 + E_2}\n$$\nThus, the final analytical estimate for the nondimensional peak shear stress is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_{xz,\\max}}{N_x/h} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\frac{E_1 - E_2}{E_1 + E_2}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically using the given material properties: $E_1 = 135 \\ \\mathrm{GPa}$ and $E_2 = 10 \\ \\mathrm{GPa}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_{xz,\\max}}{N_x/h} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\frac{135 - 10}{135 + 10} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\frac{125}{145} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\frac{25}{29}\n$$\nCalculating the value:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_{xz,\\max}}{N_x/h} \\approx \\frac{3.14159265}{4} \\times \\frac{25}{29} \\approx 0.785398 \\times 0.862069 \\approx 0.677067\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $0.6771$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6771}$$", "id": "2894716"}]}
