The proposed law is a rate-type Kelvin-Voigt model, given by $\\dot{\\sigma} = \\mathbb{L} : D$, where $\\dot{\\sigma}$ is the material time derivative of the Cauchy stress tensor $\\sigma$, $D$ is the symmetric part of the spatial velocity gradient (the rate of deformation tensor), and $\\mathbb{L}$ is a constant fourth-order tensor of material moduli.\n\nWe consider a motion that is a pure, time-dependent rigid rotation. A key characteristic of such a motion, as stated in item (iii) of the problem, is that the rate of deformation tensor is identically zero: $D(t) \\equiv 0$. Substituting this into the proposed constitutive law, we find that the stress rate in the laboratory frame must be zero:\n$$ \\dot{\\sigma}(t) = \\mathbb{L} : 0 = 0 $$\nThis implies that the Cauchy stress tensor $\\sigma$ must be constant in time in the laboratory frame. Therefore, for all time $t$, $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma(0)$, where $\\sigma(0)$ is the initial stress tensor.\n\nNext, we consider a rotating observer. The transformation rule for the Cauchy stress tensor between the laboratory frame and the frame of the rotating observer is given by item (i):\n$$ \\sigma^{*}(t) = Q(t) \\sigma(t) Q^{\\top}(t) $$\nwhere $Q(t)$ is the proper orthogonal tensor representing the rotation of the observer's frame relative to the laboratory frame.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the instantaneous rate of change of the observed stress, $\\dot{\\sigma}^{*}(t)$, evaluated at time $t=0$. To do this, we differentiate the transformation equation for $\\sigma^*$ with respect to time, applying the product rule for differentiation:\n$$ \\dot{\\sigma}^{*}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} [Q(t) \\sigma(t) Q^{\\top}(t)] = \\dot{Q}(t) \\sigma(t) Q^{\\top}(t) + Q(t) \\dot{\\sigma}(t) Q^{\\top}(t) + Q(t) \\sigma(t) \\dot{Q}^{\\top}(t) $$\nFrom our analysis of the constitutive law for this specific motion, we have established that $\\dot{\\sigma}(t) = 0$.

From this definition, we can express $\\dot{Q}(t)$ as $\\dot{Q}(t) = W^{*}(t) Q(t)$. Taking the transpose of this relation yields $\\dot{Q}^{\\top}(t) = (W^{*}(t) Q(t))^{\\top} = Q^{\\top}(t) W^{*\\top}(t)$. Since spin is skew-symmetric, $W^{*\\top}(t) = -W^{*}(t)$, so we have $\\dot{Q}^{\\top}(t) = -Q^{\\top}(t) W^{*}(t)$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions for $\\dot{Q}(t)$ and $\\dot{Q}^{\\top}(t)$ into the equation for $\\dot{\\sigma}^{*}(t)$:\n$$ \\dot{\\sigma}^{*}(t) = (W^{*}(t) Q(t)) \\sigma(t) Q^{\\top}(t) + Q(t) \\sigma(t) (-Q^{\\top}(t) W^{*}(t)) $$\n$$ \\dot{\\sigma}^{*}(t) = W^{*}(t) [Q(t) \\sigma(t) Q^{\\top}(t)] - [Q(t) \\sigma(t) Q^{\\top}(t)] W^{*}(t) $$\nRecognizing that the term in the brackets is $\\sigma^{*}(t)$, we arrive at the general expression for the observed stress rate:\n$$ \\dot{\\sigma}^{*}(t) = W^{*}(t) \\sigma^{*}(t) - \\sigma^{*}(t) W^{*}(t) = [W^{*}(t), \\sigma^{*}(t)] $$\nThis shows that the rate of change of stress seen by the rotating observer is the commutator of the observer's spin with the observed stress.\n\nWe are asked to evaluate this at $t=0$. At the initial time $t=0$, we assume the observer's frame coincides with the laboratory frame, so the rotation angle $\\theta(0)=0$ and thus $Q(0) = I$, where $I$ is the identity tensor.\nThe observed stress at $t=0$ is $\\sigma^{*}(0) = Q(0) \\sigma(0) Q^{\\top}(0) = I \\sigma(0) I = \\sigma(0)$.\nThe observer spin at $t=0$ is $W^{*}(0) = \\dot{Q}(0) Q^{\\top}(0) = \\dot{Q}(0) I = \\dot{Q}(0)$.\n\nThe rotation is a time-dependent rigid rotation about the $x_3$-axis, so for plane motion, the rotation tensor $Q(t)$ is given by:\n$$ Q(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta(t) & -\\sin\\theta(t) \\\\ \\sin\\theta(t) & \\cos\\theta(t) \\end{pmatrix} $$\nIts time derivative is:\n$$ \\dot{Q}(t) = \\dot{\\theta}(t) \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin\\theta(t) & -\\cos\\theta(t) \\\\ \\cos\\theta(t) & -\\sin\\theta(t) \\end{pmatrix} $$\nAt $t=0$, we have $\\theta(0)=0$ and the initial angular speed is given as $\\dot{\\theta}(0) = \\Omega$.
