It presents a standard problem in the mechanics of materials concerning the analysis of a curved bar subjected to pure bending. The provided assumptions, such as plane sections remaining plane and the negligence of radial stress, are consistent with the classical Winkler-Bach theory for curved beams. The givens are sufficient and consistent for deriving the requested expression and performing the subsequent numerical calculation. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe derivation of the circumferential normal stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}(r)$ proceeds from first principles as follows.\n\n1.  **Kinematics and Strain Distribution**:\n    The fundamental kinematic assumption for a curved bar in pure bending is that plane cross-sections, initially radial, remain plane after deformation and rotate about a neutral axis. Let the initial angle between two adjacent cross-sections be $d\\theta$. A fiber at a generic radius $r$ has an initial length $ds = r \\, d\\theta$. The neutral axis, at which strain is zero, is located at a radius $R_n$. After bending, the angle between the cross-sections changes by an amount $\\Delta(d\\theta)$. The elongation of the fiber at radius $r$ is proportional to its distance from the neutral axis, given by $(r-R_n) \\Delta(d\\theta)$.\n\n    The circumferential strain, $\\epsilon_{\\theta}(r)$, is the ratio of the elongation to the original length:\n    $$ \\epsilon_{\\theta}(r) = \\frac{(r-R_n) \\Delta(d\\theta)}{r \\, d\\theta} $$\n    For pure bending, the relative rotation $\\frac{\\Delta(d\\theta)}{d\\theta}$ is constant along the bar. Let us denote this constant by $k$. The strain distribution is then:\n    $$ \\epsilon_{\\theta}(r) = k \\frac{r-R_n}{r} $$\n    This equation shows that the strain distribution across the depth of a curved bar is not linear, but hyperbolic.\n\n2.  **Constitutive Relation and Stress Distribution**:\n    The material is linear elastic. Under the given assumptions of plane stress and negligible radial stress ($\\sigma_r \\approx 0$), the circumferential (hoop) stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ is related to the circumferential strain $\\epsilon_{\\theta}$ by Hooke's Law:\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\theta}(r) = E \\epsilon_{\\theta}(r) $$\n    where $E$ is the Young's modulus of the material. Substituting the expression for strain, we obtain the stress distribution as a function of the unknown constants $k$ and $R_n$:\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\theta}(r) = E k \\frac{r-R_n}{r} $$\n\n3.  **Equilibrium Conditions**:\n    The two unknown constants, $R_n$ and $k$, are determined from the static equilibrium conditions for the cross-section.\n\n    a) **Force Equilibrium**: For pure bending, the net axial force on the cross-section must be zero.\n    $$ F = \\int_A \\sigma_{\\theta}(r) \\, dA = 0 $$\n    The differential area element for the rectangular cross-section is $dA = b \\, dr$.\n    $$ \\int_{r_i}^{r_o} \\left( E k \\frac{r-R_n}{r} \\right) b \\, dr = 0 $$\n    Since $E$, $k$, and $b$ are non-zero constants, the integral must be zero:\n    $$ \\int_{r_i}^{r_o} \\left(1 - \\frac{R_n}{r}\\right) dr = 0 $$\n    $$ [r - R_n \\ln|r|]_{r_i}^{r_o} = (r_o - r_i) - R_n(\\ln r_o - \\ln r_i) = 0 $$\n    Solving for $R_n$, the radius of the neutral axis, we find:\n    $$ R_n = \\frac{r_o - r_i}{\\ln(r_o/r_i)} $$\n    The location of the neutral axis depends only on the geometry of the cross-section.\n\n    b) **Moment Equilibrium**: The internal resisting moment must be equal to the externally applied moment $M$. In keeping with the convention established in the main text (positive M increases curvature), a positive moment must be balanced by the internal stresses.\n    $$ M = \\int_A \\sigma_{\\theta}(r) \\cdot (r-R_c) \\, dA $$\n    The resultant force on the cross-section is zero. The internal moment about the centroidal axis $R_c$ is:\n    $$ M = \\int_{r_i}^{r_o} \\left( E k \\frac{r-R_n}{r} \\right) (r-R_c) \\, (b \\, dr) = E k b \\int_{r_i}^{r_o} \\left(r - R_c - R_n + \\frac{R_n R_c}{r} \\right) \\, dr $$\n    $$ M = E k b \\left[ \\frac{r^2}{2} - R_c r - R_n r + R_n R_c \\ln(r) \\right]_{r_i}^{r_o} $$\n    This simplifies to $M = E k A (R_c - R_n)$. We recognize the cross-sectional area $A = b(r_o - r_i)$ and the radius of the centroidal axis $R_c = \\frac{r_i+r_o}{2}$. The equation becomes:\n    $$ M = E k A (R_c - R_n) $$\n    The difference $e = R_c - R_n$ is known as the eccentricity of the neutral axis. Thus, we can solve for the term $Ek$:\n    $$ E k = \\frac{M}{A e} $$\n\n4.  **Final Expression for Circumferential Stress**:\n    Substituting the expression for $Ek$ back into the stress distribution equation gives the final closed-form expression for the circumferential normal stress:\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\theta}(r) = \\frac{M}{A e} \\frac{r-R_n}{r} $$\n    where the geometric parameters are defined as:\n    -   Area: $A = b(r_o - r_i)$\n    -   Centroidal Radius: $R_c = \\frac{r_i + r_o}{2}$\n    -   Neutral Axis Radius: $R_n = \\frac{r_o - r_i}{\\ln(r_o/r_i)}$\n    -   Eccentricity: $e = R_c - R_n$\n    This formula expresses $\\sigma_{\\theta}(r)$ as a function of $M$, $r$, and the geometric properties $r_i$, $r_o$, and $b$.\n\n5.  **Numerical Evaluation**:\n    We are asked to evaluate the stress at the inner surface, $r=r_i$, for the given data.

The problem specifies pure bending, which implies that the resultant axial force $F$ over the cross-sectional area $A$ is zero.\n$$ F = \\int_A \\sigma_\\theta dA = 0 $$\nSubstituting the expressions for stress and strain, and assuming a homogeneous material ($E$ is constant):\n$$ \\int_A E \\left( K \\frac{r - r_n}{r} \\right) dA = EK \\int_A \\left( 1 - \\frac{r_n}{r} \\right) dA = 0 $$\nFor non-trivial bending, $E \\neq 0$ and $K \\neq 0$. Therefore, the integral must be zero. Since $r_n$ is a constant for the cross-section, we can write:\n$$ \\int_A 1 \\, dA - r_n \\int_A \\frac{1}{r} dA = 0 $$\nThe first term is the total area of the cross-section, A. Solving for $r_n$ yields the expression for the neutral-axis radius:\n$$ r_n = \\frac{\\int_A dA}{\\int_A \\frac{1}{r} dA} $$\n\nThe centroid radius $\\bar{r}$ is, by definition, the radius-weighted average position of the area, measured from the center of curvature. It is calculated as the first moment of area divided by the total area:\n$$ \\bar{r} = \\frac{\\int_A r \\, dA}{\\int_A dA} $$\n\n**2. Specification of Integrals for the Polygonal Domain in $(r,\\theta)$ Plane**\n\nThe problem defines the cross-section $\\Omega$ as a polygon in the $(r,\\theta)$ plane. The physical area element $dA$ is related to the coordinate differentials $dr$ and $d\\theta$ by the Jacobian of the polar coordinate transformation, which is $r$. Thus, $dA = r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$. We can now express the integrals required for $r_n$ and $\\bar{r}$ as double integrals over the domain $\\Omega$ in the $(r,\\theta)$ plane.\n\nThe total area $A$ is:\n$$ A = \\int_A dA = \\iint_\\Omega r \\, dr \\, d\\theta $$\nThe denominator for $r_n$ is:\n$$ \\int_A \\frac{1}{r} dA = \\iint_\\Omega \\frac{1}{r} (r \\, dr \\, d\\theta) = \\iint_\\Omega 1 \\, dr \\, d\\theta $$\nThe numerator for $\\bar{r}$ is:\n$$ \\int_A r \\, dA = \\iint_\\Omega r (r \\, dr \\, d\\theta) = \\iint_\\Omega r^2 \\, dr \\, d\\theta $$\n\nLet us define the following integrals over the parameter domain $\\Omega$:\n- $I_0 = \\iint_\\Omega 1 \\, dr \\, d\\theta$\n- $I_1 = \\iint_\\Omega r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$\n- $I_2 = \\iint_\\Omega r^2 \\, dr \\, d\\theta$\n\nWith these definitions, our expressions become:\n$$ r_n = \\frac{I_1}{I_0} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\bar{r} = \\frac{I_2}{I_1} $$\n\n**3. Numerical Evaluation using Green's Theorem**\n\nTo evaluate these integrals exactly for a polygonal domain $\\Omega$, we apply Green's theorem. Green's theorem states that for a region $D$ with boundary $\\partial D$,\n$$ \\iint_D \\left(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial r} - \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial \\theta}\\right) dr \\, d\\theta = \\oint_{\\partial D} P \\, dr + Q \\, d\\theta $$\nWe want to evaluate integrals of the form $\\iint_\\Omega g(r) \\, dr \\, d\\theta$. We can simplify the application of Green's theorem by choosing $P=0$. Then we need to find a function $Q(r)$ such that $\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial r} = g(r)$. The area integral becomes a line integral along the boundary $\\partial \\Omega$:\n$$ \\iint_\\Omega g(r) \\, dr \\, d\\theta = \\oint_{\\partial \\Omega} Q(r) \\, d\\theta $$\n\n- For $I_0 = \\iint_\\Omega 1 \\, dr \\, d\\theta$: we have $g(r)=1$, so we can choose $Q(r)=r$.\n- For $I_1 = \\iint_\\Omega r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$: we have $g(r)=r$, so we can choose $Q(r)=\\frac{1}{2}r^2$.\n- For $I_2 = \\iint_\\Omega r^2 \\, dr \\, d\\theta$: we have $g(r)=r^2$, so we can choose $Q(r)=\\frac{1}{3}r^3$.\n\nThe boundary $\\partial \\Omega$ is composed of $N$ line segments. Let's consider a single segment from vertex $(r_i, \\theta_i)$ to $(r_{i+1}, \\theta_{i+1})$. We can parameterize this segment using a parameter $t \\in [0,1]$:\n$$ r(t) = r_i + (r_{i+1} - r_i)t \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\theta(t) = \\theta_i + (\\theta_{i+1} - \\theta_i)t $$\nLet $\\Delta r_i = r_{i+1}-r_i$ and $\\Delta \\theta_i = \\theta_{i+1}-\\theta_i$. Then $d\\theta = \\Delta\\theta_i \\, dt$.\n\nThe contribution of this edge to the line integral $\\oint Q(r) \\, d\\theta$ is $\\int_0^1 Q(r(t)) \\, \\Delta\\theta_i \\, dt$.\n\nFor $I_0$: $Q(r)=r$.\n$$ \\int_0^1 (r_i + \\Delta r_i t) \\Delta\\theta_i \\, dt = \\Delta\\theta_i \\left[r_i t + \\frac{\\Delta r_i}{2} t^2 \\right]_0^1 = \\Delta\\theta_i \\frac{r_i + r_{i+1}}{2} $$\nSumming over all edges gives $I_0 = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^N (r_i + r_{i+1})\\Delta\\theta_i$.\n\nFor $I_1$: $Q(r)=\\frac{1}{2}r^2$.\n$$ \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{2}(r_i + \\Delta r_i t)^2 \\Delta\\theta_i \\, dt = \\frac{\\Delta\\theta_i}{2} \\left[ \\frac{(r_i + \\Delta r_i t)^3}{3 \\Delta r_i} \\right]_0^1 = \\frac{\\Delta\\theta_i}{6\\Delta r_i} (r_{i+1}^3 - r_i^3) = \\frac{\\Delta\\theta_i}{6} (r_i^2 + r_i r_{i+1} + r_{i+1}^2) $$\nSumming over all edges gives $I_1 = \\frac{1}{6} \\sum_{i=1}^N (r_i^2 + r_i r_{i+1} + r_{i+1}^2)\\Delta\\theta_i$.\n\nFor $I_2$: $Q(r)=\\frac{1}{3}r^3$.\n$$ \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{3}(r_i + \\Delta r_i t)^3 \\Delta\\theta_i \\, dt = \\frac{\\Delta\\theta_i}{3} \\left[ \\frac{(r_i + \\Delta r_i t)^4}{4 \\Delta r_i} \\right]_0^1 = \\frac{\\Delta\\theta_i}{12\\Delta r_i} (r_{i+1}^4 - r_i^4) = \\frac{\\Delta\\theta_i}{12} (r_{i+1} + r_i)(r_{i+1}^2 + r_i^2) $$\nSumming over all edges gives $I_2 = \\frac{1}{12} \\sum_{i=1}^N (r_i + r_{i+1})(r_i^2 + r_{i+1}^2)\\Delta\\theta_i$.\n\nIn all summations, the index $i$ runs from $1$ to $N$, and vertex $N+1$ is taken to be vertex $1$.\nThese formulas are exact and robust, avoiding division by $\\Delta r_i$ or $\\Delta \\theta_i$ which might be zero.
