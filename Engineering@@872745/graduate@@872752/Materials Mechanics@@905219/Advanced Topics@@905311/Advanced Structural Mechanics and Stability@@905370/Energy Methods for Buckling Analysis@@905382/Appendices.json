The analysis will proceed systematically through the derivation of the total potential energy functional, its first variation, the derivation of the Rayleigh quotient, and finally the evaluation for a specified admissible trial function.\n\nThe total potential energy of the system, denoted by $\\Pi$, is the sum of the internal strain energy of deformation, $U$, and the potential energy of the externally applied load, $\\Omega$. The equilibrium configuration of the system is one that renders the total potential energy stationary, which is expressed as $\\delta \\Pi = 0$.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the strain energy, $U$. For an Euler-Bernoulli beam, the strain energy is due to bending only. It is given by the integral of one-half the product of the bending moment $M(x)$ and the curvature $\\kappa(x)$ along the length $L$ of the column.\n$$\nU = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} M(x) \\kappa(x) \\, dx\n$$\nThe constitutive relation for a linearly elastic material is $M(x) = EI \\kappa(x)$, where $E$ is the Young's modulus and $I$ is the second moment of area of the cross-section. For small transverse deflections $w(x)$, the curvature is approximated as $\\kappa(x) \\approx w''(x)$, where primes denote differentiation with respect to the axial coordinate $x$. Substituting these into the expression for $U$ yields:\n$$\nU = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} EI (w''(x))^{2} \\, dx\n$$\nNext, we derive the potential energy of the external compressive load, $\\Omega$. This is given by the negative product of the constant axial force $P$ and the axial shortening of the column, $\\Delta L$, that results from the transverse deflection $w(x)$.\n$$\n\\Omega = -P \\Delta L\n$$\nThe elemental arc length $ds$ of the deflected curve is related to the elemental axial length $dx$ by $ds = \\sqrt{1 + (w'(x))^{2}} \\, dx$. The total arc length $S$ is the integral of $ds$ from $x=0$ to $x=L$.\n$$\nS = \\int_{0}^{L} \\sqrt{1 + (w'(x))^{2}} \\, dx\n$$\nThe problem statement specifies the assumption of small slopes, $|w'(x)| \\ll 1$. We may therefore employ a binomial expansion for the square root term: $\\sqrt{1+u} \\approx 1 + \\frac{1}{2} u$ for small $u$. With $u = (w'(x))^{2}$, we have:\n$$\nS \\approx \\int_{0}^{L} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2} (w'(x))^{2}\\right) \\, dx = L + \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} (w'(x))^{2} \\, dx\n$$\nThe axial shortening is the difference between the arc length and the original length:\n$$\n\\Delta L = S - L = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} (w'(x))^{2} \\, dx\n$$\nThus, the potential energy of the external load is:\n$$\n\\Omega = -\\frac{P}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} (w'(x))^{2} \\, dx\n$$\nThe total potential energy functional $\\Pi[w]$ is the sum of $U$ and $\\Omega$:\n$$\n\\Pi[w] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} EI (w''(x))^{2} \\, dx - \\frac{P}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} (w'(x))^{2} \\, dx\n$$\nThis completes the first task. For the second task, we find the stationarity condition by taking the first variation of $\\Pi$ and setting it to zero, $\\delta \\Pi = 0$.\n$$\n\\delta \\Pi = \\delta \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} \\left[ EI (w'')^{2} - P (w')^{2} \\right] dx \\right) = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left[ EI w'' \\delta(w'') - P w' \\delta(w') \\right] dx = 0\n$$\nRecognizing that the variation and differentiation operators commute, i.e., $\\delta(w') = (\\delta w)'$ and $\\delta(w'') = (\\delta w)''$, we have:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} \\left[ EI w'' (\\delta w)'' - P w' (\\delta w)' \\right] dx = 0\n$$\nWe apply integration by parts to this expression. For the first term:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} EI w'' (\\delta w)'' \\, dx = \\left[ EI w'' (\\delta w)' \\right]_{0}^{L} - \\int_{0}^{L} EI w''' (\\delta w)' \\, dx\n$$\nIntegrating by parts again on the integral term:\n$$\n- \\int_{0}^{L} EI w''' (\\delta w)' \\, dx = - \\left[ EI w''' \\delta w \\right]_{0}^{L} + \\int_{0}^{L} EI w'''' \\delta w \\, dx\n$$\nFor the second term in the variation expression:\n$$\n- \\int_{0}^{L} P w' (\\delta w)' \\, dx = - \\left[ P w' \\delta w \\right]_{0}^{L} + \\int_{0}^{L} P w'' \\delta w \\, dx\n$$\nCombining all terms, the first variation becomes:\n$$\n\\delta \\Pi = \\int_{0}^{L} (EI w'''' + P w'') \\delta w \\, dx + \\left[ EI w'' (\\delta w)' \\right]_{0}^{L} - \\left[ (EI w''' + P w') \\delta w \\right]_{0}^{L} = 0\n$$\nFor this equation to hold for any arbitrary but kinematically admissible variation $\\delta w$, both the integral and the boundary terms must vanish independently. The vanishing of the integral term for any $\\delta w$ in the domain $(0, L)$ yields the governing differential equation (the Euler-Lagrange equation):\n$$\nEI w''''(x) + P w''(x) = 0\n$$\nThe vanishing of the boundary terms provides the boundary conditions of the problem:\n$$\n\\left[ EI w'' (\\delta w)' - (EI w''' + P w') \\delta w \\right]_{x=L} - \\left[ EI w'' (\\delta w)' - (EI w''' + P w') \\delta w \\right]_{x=0} = 0\n$$\nFor a clamped end, the deflection $w$ and the slope $w'$ are prescribed to be zero. These are the **essential** (or geometric) boundary conditions:\n$$\nw(0) = 0, \\quad w'(0) = 0, \\quad w(L) = 0, \\quad w'(L) = 0\n$$\nBecause the deflection and slope are fixed, any admissible variation must also vanish at these points, i.e., $\\delta w(0) = 0$, $\\delta w'(0) = 0$, $\\delta w(L) = 0$, and $\\delta w'(L) = 0$. When these conditions on the variation are enforced, the boundary term in the expression for $\\delta \\Pi$ is identically zero. Therefore, for a problem with clamped ends, any trial function $\\phi(x)$ used in an approximate method like Rayleigh-Ritz **must** satisfy these four essential boundary conditions. The remaining boundary conditions, $EIw'' = 0$ (zero moment) or $EIw'''+Pw' = 0$ (zero effective shear), are called **natural** boundary conditions and are satisfied automatically by the solution if not prescribed.\n\nFor the third task, we use the Rayleigh-Ritz method with a one-term approximation $w(x) = a \\phi(x)$, where $a$ is an unknown amplitude and $\\phi(x)$ is an admissible shape function satisfying the essential boundary conditions. Substituting this into the total potential energy functional gives $\\Pi$ as a function of $a$:\n$$\n\\Pi(a) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} EI (a \\phi''(x))^{2} \\, dx - \\frac{P}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} (a \\phi'(x))^{2} \\, dx\n$$\n$$\n\\Pi(a) = \\frac{a^{2}}{2} \\left[ EI \\int_{0}^{L} (\\phi''(x))^{2} \\, dx - P \\int_{0}^{L} (\\phi'(x))^{2} \\, dx \\right]\n$$\nThe stationarity condition becomes $\\frac{d\\Pi}{da} = 0$.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\Pi}{da} = a \\left[ EI \\int_{0}^{L} (\\phi''(x))^{2} \\, dx - P \\int_{0}^{L} (\\phi'(x))^{2} \\, dx \\right] = 0\n$$\nFor a non-trivial buckled solution, $w(x) \\neq 0$, which implies $a \\neq 0$. Therefore, the term in the brackets must be zero. Solving for the load parameter $P$ yields the Rayleigh quotient:\n$$\nP = \\frac{EI \\int_{0}^{L} (\\phi''(x))^{2} \\, dx}{\\int_{0}^{L} (\\phi'(x))^{2} \\, dx}\n$$\nFor the fourth and final task, we evaluate this quotient using the specified shape function $\\phi(x) = 1 - \\cos(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L})$. We have already verified in the validation phase that this function satisfies all four essential boundary conditions for a clamped-clamped column. We compute the required derivatives:\n$$\n\\phi'(x) = \\frac{2\\pi}{L} \\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\phi''(x) = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2} \\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) = \\frac{4\\pi^{2}}{L^{2}} \\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we evaluate the integrals in the numerator and denominator of the Rayleigh quotient.\nThe numerator integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} (\\phi''(x))^{2} \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left(\\frac{4\\pi^{2}}{L^{2}}\\right)^{2} \\cos^{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\, dx = \\frac{16\\pi^{4}}{L^{4}} \\int_{0}^{L} \\cos^{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\, dx\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\cos^{2}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\cos(2\\theta))$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} (\\phi''(x))^{2} \\, dx = \\frac{16\\pi^{4}}{L^{4}} \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right) \\, dx = \\frac{8\\pi^{4}}{L^{4}} \\left[ x + \\frac{L}{4\\pi}\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{L} = \\frac{8\\pi^{4}}{L^{4}} (L) = \\frac{8\\pi^{4}}{L^{3}}\n$$\nThe denominator integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} (\\phi'(x))^{2} \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2} \\sin^{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\, dx = \\frac{4\\pi^{2}}{L^{2}} \\int_{0}^{L} \\sin^{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\, dx\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\sin^{2}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\cos(2\\theta))$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} (\\phi'(x))^{2} \\, dx = \\frac{4\\pi^{2}}{L^{2}} \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - \\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right) \\, dx = \\frac{2\\pi^{2}}{L^{2}} \\left[ x - \\frac{L}{4\\pi}\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{L} = \\frac{2\\pi^{2}}{L^{2}} (L) = \\frac{2\\pi^{2}}{L}\n$$\nSubstituting these results back into the Rayleigh quotient for $P$:\n$$\nP = EI \\frac{\\frac{8\\pi^{4}}{L^{3}}}{\\frac{2\\pi^{2}}{L}} = EI \\left(\\frac{8\\pi^{4}}{L^{3}} \\cdot \\frac{L}{2\\pi^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{4\\pi^{2}EI}{L^{2}}\n$$\nThis result is the exact critical load for a clamped-clamped column, which indicates that the chosen trial function $\\phi(x) = 1 - \\cos(2\\pi x/L)$ is, in fact, the true buckling mode shape for the lowest critical load.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{4 \\pi^{2} EI}{L^{2}}}\n$$", "id": "2883663"}, {"introduction": "While a single-term approximation can provide a quick estimate, accuracy often requires a more flexible trial function.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information to proceed with a solution. No inconsistencies, ambiguities, or violations of physical principles are present.

At the critical load, the equilibrium state transitions from stable to unstable, which, in the context of the energy method, corresponds to the potential energy ceasing to be a minimum. This condition is found by seeking non-trivial solutions to the stationarity condition, $\\delta\\Pi = 0$.\n\nFirst, we must construct admissible basis functions for the RR approximation $w(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \\phi_i(x)$. Admissible functions must satisfy the essential (geometric) boundary conditions. Here, the essential boundary conditions are given as $w(0)=0$, $w'(0)=0$, and $w(L)=0$ for a column clamped at $x=0$ and pinned at $x=L$.\n\nWe seek two algebraic basis functions, $\\{\\phi_1(x), \\phi_2(x)\\}$, of the lowest possible polynomial degrees. A general polynomial is $\\phi(x) = c_0 + c_1x + c_2x^2 + \\dots$.\nThe condition $\\phi(0)=0$ implies $c_0=0$.\nThe condition $\\phi'(0)=0$ implies $c_1=0$.\nSo the polynomial must be of the form $\\phi(x) = c_2x^2 + c_3x^3 + \\dots$.\nThe condition $\\phi(L)=0$ imposes a constraint on the remaining coefficients: $c_2L^2 + c_3L^3 + \\dots = 0$.\nTo find the lowest degree polynomial, we truncate the series. A quadratic $\\phi(x)=c_2x^2$ cannot satisfy $\\phi(L)=0$ unless $c_2=0$ (the trivial solution). Thus, we must use at least a cubic polynomial.\nFor $\\phi_1(x) = c_2x^2 + c_3x^3$, the condition $\\phi_1(L)=0$ gives $c_2L^2+c_3L^3=0$, which implies $c_3 = -c_2/L$. Choosing $c_2=1/L^2$ for non-dimensionalization gives $c_3=-1/L^3$, so $\\phi_1(x) = (x/L)^2 - (x/L)^3$.\nFor the second basis function $\\phi_2(x)$, we must choose a polynomial of a higher degree that is linearly independent of $\\phi_1(x)$. The next logical choice is a quartic polynomial, $\\phi_2(x) = d_2x^2 + d_3x^3 + d_4x^4$, which must also satisfy the three boundary conditions. A simple and systematic way to construct these functions is to use the form $x^2(L-x)x^k$, for $k \\geq 0$.\nFor the lowest degree, we select $k=0$ and $k=1$.
