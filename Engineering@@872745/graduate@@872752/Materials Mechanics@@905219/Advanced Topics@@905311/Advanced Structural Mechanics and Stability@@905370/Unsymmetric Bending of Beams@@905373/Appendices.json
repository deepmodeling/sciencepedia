Inverting the matrix gives:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} \\kappa_y \\\\ \\kappa_z \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{E(I_y I_z - I_{yz}^2)} \\begin{pmatrix} -I_z & -I_{yz} \\\\ I_{yz} & I_y \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} M_y \\\\ M_z \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFor the specific loading case where $M_y$ is applied and $M_z=0$:\n$$ \\kappa_y = \\frac{-M_y I_z}{E(I_y I_z - I_{yz}^2)} $$\n$$ \\kappa_z = \\frac{M_y I_{yz}}{E(I_y I_z - I_{yz}^2)} $$\n\nThe neutral axis (NA) is defined as the locus of points in the cross-section where the axial stress $\\sigma_x$ (and strain $\\epsilon_x$) is zero.\n$$ \\sigma_x = 0 \\implies \\kappa_z y + \\kappa_y z = 0 $$\nThis is the equation of a line passing through the centroid $(0,0)$. The slope $m=y/z$ of this line is found by rearranging the equation:\n$$ m = \\frac{y}{z} = -\\frac{\\kappa_y}{\\kappa_z} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the curvatures for the case $M_z=0$:\n$$ m = -\\frac{\\frac{-M_y I_z}{E(I_y I_z - I_{yz}^2)}}{\\frac{M_y I_{yz}}{E(I_y I_z - I_{yz}^2)}} = -\\frac{-I_z}{I_{yz}} = \\frac{I_z}{I_{yz}} $$\nThus, the equation for the neutral axis can be written as $y = z(I_z/I_{yz})$, or more fundamentally, $I_{yz} y - I_z z = 0$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. **For pure bending with $M_z=0$, replacing $I_{yz}$ by $-I_{yz}$ reverses the sign of the predicted neutral axis slope $m=y/z$; its magnitude is unchanged.**\nThe derived slope of the neutral axis is $m = I_z/I_{yz}$. Let this be the correct slope, $m_{correct}$.\nIf a colleague uses $-I_{yz}$ in place of a positive $I_{yz}$, the incorrectly predicted slope will be:\n$$ m_{incorrect} = \\frac{I_z}{(-I_{yz})} = - \\frac{I_z}{I_{yz}} = -m_{correct} $$\nThis shows that the sign of the slope is reversed. The magnitude of the slope is $|m| = |I_z / I_{yz}|$, which is independent of the sign of $I_{yz}$ and therefore remains unchanged.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. **For pure bending with $M_z=0$, replacing $I_{yz}$ by $-I_{yz}$ rotates the neutral axis by $90^\\circ$.**\nTwo lines with slopes $m_1$ and $m_2$ are perpendicular (rotated by $90^\\circ$) if and only if their product is $m_1 m_2 = -1$.\nIn this case, the product of the correct and incorrect slopes is $m_{correct} \\cdot m_{incorrect} = m_{correct} \\cdot (-m_{correct}) = -m_{correct}^2$.\nThis product equals $-1$ only if $m_{correct}^2 = 1$, which means $m_{correct} = \\pm 1$.\nThe given properties are $I_z = 9.0\\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{mm}^4$ and $I_{yz} = 3.0\\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{mm}^4$. The slope is $m_{correct} = (9.0 \\times 10^6) / (3.0 \\times 10^6) = 3$.\nSince $m_{correct} \\neq \\pm 1$, the rotation is not $90^\\circ$. The incorrect neutral axis is a reflection of the correct neutral axis across the $z$-axis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. **A right triangular area bounded by $0\\le y\\le b$, $0\\le z\\le h(1-y/b)$, with centroidal axes parallel to its legs, has $I_{yz,\\mathrm{centroid}}=-\\,b^2 h^2/72<0$; this makes it a reliable sign-diagnostic benchmark.**\nTo verify this, we must calculate the centroidal product of inertia.\nFirst, the area is $A = \\frac{1}{2}bh$. The centroid with respect to the legs as axes is $(\\bar{y}, \\bar{z}) = (b/3, h/3)$.\nSecond, we calculate the product of inertia $I_{yz,0}$ with respect to the axes formed by the legs:\n$$ I_{yz,0} = \\int_A yz \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\int_0^b y \\left( \\int_0^{h(1-y/b)} z \\, \\mathrm{d}z \\right) \\mathrm{d}y = \\int_0^b y \\frac{h^2}{2} (1 - y/b)^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}y $$\n$$ I_{yz,0} = \\frac{h^2}{2} \\int_0^b (y - \\frac{2y^2}{b} + \\frac{y^3}{b^2}) \\, \\mathrm{d}y = \\frac{h^2}{2} \\left[ \\frac{y^2}{2} - \\frac{2y^3}{3b} + \\frac{y^4}{4b^2} \\right]_0^b $$\n$$ I_{yz,0} = \\frac{h^2}{2} \\left( \\frac{b^2}{2} - \\frac{2b^2}{3} + \\frac{b^2}{4} \\right) = \\frac{b^2 h^2}{2} \\left( \\frac{6-8+3}{12} \\right) = \\frac{b^2 h^2}{24} $$\nThird, we use the parallel axis theorem for products of inertia: $I_{yz,0} = I_{yz,\\mathrm{centroid}} + A \\bar{y} \\bar{z}$.\n$$ I_{yz,\\mathrm{centroid}} = I_{yz,0} - A \\bar{y} \\bar{z} = \\frac{b^2 h^2}{24} - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}bh\\right)\\left(\\frac{b}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{h}{3}\\right) $$\n$$ I_{yz,\\mathrm{centroid}} = \\frac{b^2 h^2}{24} - \\frac{b^2 h^2}{18} = b^2 h^2 \\left(\\frac{3-4}{72}\\right) = -\\frac{b^2 h^2}{72} $$\nThe result is indeed $-\\frac{b^2 h^2}{72}$, which is strictly negative for any non-degenerate triangle ($b>0, h>0$). Because this shape is simple to define and its centroidal product of inertia has a definite, non-zero sign, it serves as an excellent benchmark for verifying the sign conventions in a computer code or analytical derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nD. **Under $M_z=0$ and isotropic material, changing the sign of $I_{yz}$ changes the magnitude of the curvature component $\\kappa_y$.**\nFrom our derivation, the curvature component $\\kappa_y$ for $M_z=0$ is:\n$$ \\kappa_y = \\frac{-M_y I_z}{E(I_y I_z - I_{yz}^2)} $$\nThis expression depends on $I_{yz}^2$. Replacing $I_{yz}$ with $-I_{yz}$ results in $(-I_{yz})^2 = I_{yz}^2$, leaving the denominator unchanged. The entire expression for $\\kappa_y$ is therefore invariant to a change in the sign of $I_{yz}$. Its value, and thus its magnitude, does not change. In contrast, the curvature $\\kappa_z = \\frac{M_y I_{yz}}{E(I_y I_z - I_{yz}^2)}$ does change sign.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2928933"}]}
