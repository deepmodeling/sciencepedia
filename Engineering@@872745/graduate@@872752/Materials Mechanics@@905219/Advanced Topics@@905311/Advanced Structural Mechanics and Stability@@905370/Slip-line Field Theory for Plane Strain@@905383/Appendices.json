The solution proceeds by applying the Hencky characteristic relations, which are fundamental to slip-line field theory and are consistent with the main article.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical framework. The state of stress is defined by the mean compressive stress, $p$, and the angle of the major principal stress direction, $\\theta$. The governing equations of equilibrium and yield lead to a system of hyperbolic partial differential equations. The characteristics of this system are the slip-lines ($\\alpha$-lines and $\\beta$-lines).

We will determine the indentation load using the slip-line field theory developed in the main text.\n\nFirst, we establish the stress state and principal stress orientation, $\\theta$, at the boundaries of the plastic zone. The coordinate system has its origin at the center of the punch, with the $x$-axis along the interface and the $y$-axis pointing into the solid. The stress components are parameterized by the mean compressive stress $p$ and the principal stress angle $\\theta$:\n$$ \\sigma_{yy} = -p - k \\cos(2\\theta) $$\n$$ \\tau_{xy} = k \\sin(2\\theta) $$\n\nWe determine the boundary conditions for the stress field.\n\n1.  **On the traction-free surface** ($y=0$, $|x|>a$): The normal and shear tractions are zero, so $\\sigma_{yy} = 0$ and $\\tau_{xy} = 0$.\n    From $\\tau_{xy} = k \\sin(2\\theta) = 0$, we find that $2\\theta = n\\pi$ for integer $n$, which implies $\\theta = n\\pi/2$. We test these possibilities:\n    - If $\\theta=0$: The condition $\\sigma_{yy}=0$ becomes $-p - k\\cos(0) = -p-k = 0$, yielding $p=-k$. A negative compressive stress is tensile, which is physically implausible.\n    - If $\\theta=\\pi/2$: The condition $\\sigma_{yy}=0$ becomes $-p - k\\cos(\\pi) = -p+k = 0$, yielding $p=k$. The corresponding horizontal stress is $\\sigma_{xx} = -p+k\\cos(\\pi) = -k-k=-2k$. This compressive state is physically correct.\n    Thus, in the plastic region adjacent to the free surface, the state is characterized by a mean stress $p=k$ and a principal stress angle $\\theta=\\pi/2$.\n\n2.  **On the smooth punch surface** ($y=0$, $|x|<a$): The punch is smooth, so the shear stress is zero, $\\tau_{xy}=0$. This again implies $\\theta=n\\pi/2$. The classical slip-line field for this problem consists of a central triangular region under the punch, where the principal directions are aligned with the axes, connected to the outer regions via Prandtl fans. This requires $\\theta=0$ under the punch.\n\nNow, we use Hencky's equations to relate the stress states across the Prandtl fan. The fan connects the region near the free surface, where $(p, \\theta) = (k, \\pi/2)$, to the region under the punch, where the angle is $\\theta=0$. The path that crosses the fan from one region to the other is a $\\beta$-slip line. Hencky's second theorem states that along a $\\beta$-slip line, $p+2k\\theta = \\text{constant}$.\n\nLet the mean stress under the punch be $p_{punch}$. Applying the relation between the free surface state and the under-punch state:\n$$ p_{punch} + 2k\\theta_{punch} = p_{free} + 2k\\theta_{free} $$\n$$ p_{punch} + 2k(0) = k + 2k(\\pi/2) $$\n$$ p_{punch} = k + k\\pi = k(1+\\pi) $$\nThis is the uniform mean compressive stress in the central triangular region under the punch.\n\nNext, we calculate the contact pressure, $p_c$, acting on the punch face. This pressure is the normal stress component $-\\sigma_{yy}$ evaluated at the punch surface. Using the stress relations with the state under the punch ($p=p_{punch}=k(1+\\pi)$ and $\\theta=0$):\n$$ \\sigma_{yy} = -p_{punch} - k \\cos(2\\theta) = -k(1+\\pi) - k \\cos(0) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{yy} = -k(1+\\pi) - k = -k(2+\\pi) $$\nThe contact pressure is therefore uniform and given by:\n$$ p_c = -\\sigma_{yy} = k(2+\\pi) $$\n\nTo find the resultant load $P$ per unit thickness, we integrate this pressure over the width of the punch. The punch has a half-width of $a$, so its total width is $2a$.\n$$ P = \\int_{-a}^{a} p_c \\,dx = p_c \\int_{-a}^{a} dx = p_c (2a) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $p_c$:\n$$ P = 2a k(2+\\pi) $$\nThis result is derived from a statically admissible stress field and thus constitutes a lower bound on the true collapse load.\n\nFor this classical Prandtl-Hill slip-line field, a corresponding kinematically admissible velocity field also exists. The upper bound theorem of plasticity states that the load calculated from such a field is an upper bound to the collapse load. For this specific problem, the detailed kinematic calculation yields an upper bound load that is identical to the lower bound load derived above. Since the lower and upper bounds coincide, this slip-line field provides the exact solution for the collapse load under the given idealizations. The two results coincide. The final answer is the expression for the load $P$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{2ak(2+\\pi)} $$", "id": "2891689"}, {"introduction": "Advanced analysis requires understanding not only how to apply a theory, but also its limitations and subtleties. This final practice delves into the mathematical nature of the governing hyperbolic equations and the consequent potential for non-unique solutions. Grappling with this conceptual challenge will deepen your understanding of why different valid deformation modes can exist for the same boundary conditions, a crucial consideration when interpreting theoretical predictions.", "problem": "A rigid-perfectly plastic, isotropic material obeying the von Mises ($J_{2}$) yield condition with associated flow is deformed under plane strain, small deformation, quasi-static conditions with no body forces. Let the Cauchy stress be $\\sigma_{ij}$, the mean compressive stress be $p=-(\\sigma_{xx}+\\sigma_{yy})/2$, and the shear yield stress be $k$, a positive constant.

It is known that for such materials in plane strain the slip-line field theory reduces the problem to first-order equations along characteristic curves. Consider boundary value problems where tractions and/or velocities are prescribed on parts of a smooth boundary, which may or may not be characteristic with respect to the slip-line equations.\n\nSelect all statements that correctly describe conditions under which multiple slip-line fields can satisfy the same boundary data and that provide a valid example illustrating non-uniqueness in plane strain plasticity:\n\nA. Because the first-order equations governing $p$ and the principal stress directions are hyperbolic, a unique field in a domain requires Cauchy data (sufficient independent data for both $p$ and the slip-line orientation) given on a non-characteristic boundary curve spanning the domain. If only incomplete data are given or if data are posed on a characteristic, multiple slip-line fields may satisfy the same boundary tractions. For example, the plane strain indentation of a rigid-perfectly plastic half-space by a flat, smooth punch admits more than one admissible slip-line field that all reproduce the same prescribed normal traction under the punch (with zero shear) and zero tractions outside contact, differing by the presence and width of a central rigid zone under the punch.\n\nB. If both components of velocity are prescribed along a smooth boundary segment that is not characteristic, then the slip-line field in the adjacent plastic region is unique up to a rigid-body motion; consequently, non-uniqueness cannot occur in plane strain extrusion through a straight die when inlet and outlet velocities are prescribed.\n\nC. When boundary data are posed only as the normal traction along a boundary segment that coincides with a slip line (a characteristic), the resulting local boundary value problem is ill-posed in the sense of uniqueness: there exist infinitely many neighboring slip-line fields that satisfy the same data on that boundary segment, reflecting the hyperbolic character of the governing equations.\n\nD. In plane strain bending of a perfectly plastic strip in fully plastic response, prescribing the net bending moment at the ends uniquely determines the slip-line field in the interior because the moment fixes the mean stress field $p$ everywhere through equilibrium, leaving no freedom for non-uniqueness.\n\nChoose all that apply.", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify correct statements regarding the non-uniqueness of solutions in slip-line field theory, which is governed by a system of hyperbolic partial differential equations. The definitions for stress, yield, and equilibrium provided are standard and consistent with the main article.\n\nThe governing equations for the stress field in plane strain plasticity can be parameterized by the mean compressive stress $p$ and the principal stress angle $\\theta$. The substitution of these into the equilibrium equations results in a system of first-order quasi-linear partial differential equations. This system is hyperbolic, and its two families of real characteristics are the physical slip-lines ($\\alpha$- and $\\beta$-lines). Along these lines, the Hencky equations apply:\n$$ p - 2k\\theta = \\text{constant along an } \\alpha\\text{-line} $$\n$$ p + 2k\\theta = \\text{constant along a } \\beta\\text{-line} $$\nThe hyperbolic nature of these equations is the fundamental reason for potential non-uniqueness of solutions under certain boundary conditions. We will now evaluate each option.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\nThis statement correctly identifies that the governing equations for $p$ and $\\theta$ are hyperbolic. The theory of hyperbolic PDEs dictates that a well-posed problem, leading to a unique solution, requires the specification of sufficient independent data (Cauchy data) on a non-characteristic curve. For the system of two first-order equations for $p$ and $\\theta$, this typically means specifying two independent quantities, such as the two components of the traction vector, on a boundary segment that is not a slip-line.\n\nThe statement continues that if the data are incomplete (e.g., only one traction component is specified) or if the boundary itself is a characteristic, the problem may be ill-posed with respect to uniqueness. This is also a correct assertion based on the theory of characteristics.\n\nThe example provided is the indentation of a semi-infinite block by a flat, smooth punch. This is a canonical problem in plasticity known to exhibit non-uniqueness. Several distinct slip-line fields have been proposed by Prandtl, Hill, and Green, among others. These fields all satisfy the stress boundary conditions (constant normal pressure and zero shear under the punch, zero traction on the free surface) and yield the same limit load (indentation pressure), yet they correspond to different velocity fields and internal flow patterns. The non-uniqueness is often attributed to the geometric singularities at the punch corners and the fact that the straight punch-material interface can coincide with a slip-line. The solutions differ in the assumed configuration of the plastic and rigid regions, particularly the existence and extent of a 'dead-metal' zone of rigid material that adheres to the punch. Thus, the example is valid and correctly illustrates the principle.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\nThis statement claims that prescribing both components of velocity on a non-characteristic boundary segment uniquely determines the slip-line field. It then concludes that non-uniqueness is impossible in plane strain extrusion.\n\nThe conclusion is factually incorrect. The problem of plane strain extrusion through a straight, frictionless die is another classic example where multiple slip-line field solutions are known to exist. These different solutions satisfy the velocity boundary conditions at the inlet and outlet and the stress-free conditions on the extruded surface, but they differ in the internal flow pattern, particularly in the size of the rigid 'dead-metal' zones that can form at the sharp corners of the die. These different fields can also predict slightly different extrusion pressures. Since the example used to support the claim is invalid, the entire statement is flawed. The initial premise is also overly strong; while velocity boundary conditions place very strong constraints on the problem, non-uniqueness can still arise from geometric singularities or other features of the boundary value problem.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThis statement discusses a boundary value problem where data is given on a boundary segment that is itself a slip-line (a characteristic curve). It posits that if only the normal traction is specified along such a boundary, the problem is ill-posed for uniqueness, admitting infinitely many solutions.\n\nThis is a correct statement rooted in the mathematical theory of hyperbolic equations. Along a characteristic curve, the governing equations reduce to interior relations (the Hencky equations). Data specified on a characteristic curve cannot uniquely determine the solution in the adjacent domain. Let the characteristic be a $\\beta$-line. The direction is given by $\\theta-\\pi/4$. The normal stress on this line is $\\sigma_n = -p-k\\sin(2\\theta)$. Specifying the normal traction does not uniquely determine $p$ or $\\theta$ independently. Even if both $p$ and $\\theta$ were known along this characteristic (e.g., the $\\beta$-line), the corresponding Hencky invariant ($p+2k\\theta$) would be fixed along it. However, this provides no information about the other family of characteristics ($\\alpha$-lines) that intersect this boundary. The value of the second Hencky invariant ($p-2k\\theta$) on each of these incoming $\\alpha$-characteristics remains arbitrary. Each arbitrary choice for the function defining this second invariant on the incoming characteristics generates a distinct, valid slip-line field in the neighborhood of the boundary. Hence, there exist infinitely many local solutions.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nThis statement concerns the fully plastic bending of a strip and claims that prescribing the net bending moment uniquely determines the slip-line field. The reasoning provided is that the moment fixes the mean stress field $p$.\n\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, the reasoning is flawed. The net bending moment $M = \\int \\sigma_{xx} y \\, dA$ is an integral constraint on the stress field. It does not uniquely determine the point-wise stress distribution $\\sigma_{xx}(x,y)$, let alone the entire mean stress field $p(x,y)$. Multiple stress distributions can integrate to the same moment.\n\nSecond, the conclusion is false. The problem of fully plastic bending is known to admit non-unique slip-line fields. While a simple solution exists with straight slip-lines at $\\pm 45^{\\circ}$ to the neutral axis, corresponding to a pure bending stress field, other more complex fields involving circular fans near the neutral axis have been shown to be equally valid from a statics perspective (i.e., they are statically admissible and correspond to the same limit moment $M_p$). These different fields correspond to different modes of plastic deformation (different velocity fields). Therefore, prescribing the moment does not guarantee a unique slip-line field.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2917561"}]}
