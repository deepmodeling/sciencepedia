This parameter elegantly combines the Young's moduli and Poisson's ratios of both bodies into a single term, allowing the complex two-body problem to be treated as a more straightforward case of a rigid indenter on an equivalent elastic half-space. This foundational exercise guides you through the derivation of $E^*$ from first principles and explores its sensitivity to material properties, providing a solid grasp of the material parameters that govern elastic contact [@problem_id:2891983].", "problem": "Two homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic bodies come into frictionless, axisymmetric normal contact under a slowly applied load within the regime where classical Hertzian assumptions hold: small strains, small contact area relative to characteristic radii of curvature, and no adhesion. Let the Young’s moduli be $E_1$ and $E_2$, with Poisson’s ratios $\\nu_1$ and $\\nu_2$, respectively. The normal surface approach is the sum of the individual half-space surface displacements produced by the same axisymmetric pressure distribution due to linearity and superposition.\n\nStarting from the fundamental base of linear elasticity (Hooke’s law) and the classical Boussinesq solution for the normal displacement of an isotropic elastic half-space due to normal loading, derive the material combination that defines the Hertzian effective (or reduced) modulus $E^*$ for two bodies in contact so that the normal displacement field in the contact region depends on the materials only through $E^*$.

The final answer must be a single real number equal to this rounded $E^*$.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is a well-posed problem in classical linear elastic contact mechanics, free of scientific or logical flaws. The necessary data is provided, and the objectives are clear. We shall proceed with the derivation and subsequent calculations.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the effective modulus, $E^*$, for two elastic bodies in contact. The starting point is the Boussinesq solution for the normal displacement of an elastic half-space subjected to a surface pressure distribution.\n\nLet us consider an elastic half-space with Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$. When subjected to a pressure distribution $p(\\xi, \\eta)$ over a contact area $\\Omega$ on its surface ($z=0$), the normal displacement $u_z$ at a point $(x, y)$ on the surface is given by the integral of the point load solution:\n$$ u_z(x,y) = \\frac{1-\\nu^2}{\\pi E} \\iint_{\\Omega} \\frac{p(\\xi, \\eta)}{\\sqrt{(x-\\xi)^2 + (y-\\eta)^2}} d\\xi d\\eta $$\nThis result is a direct consequence of the linear theory of elasticity.\n\nThe problem states that two bodies, designated body $1$ and body $2$, are in contact. Their material properties are $(E_1, \\nu_1)$ and $(E_2, \\nu_2)$, respectively. According to Newton's third law, the pressure distribution $p(\\xi, \\eta)$ exerted by body $1$ on body $2$ is identical in magnitude to the pressure exerted by body $2$ on body $1$. Within the Hertzian framework, the total normal approach of the surfaces is the sum of the individual surface displacements, $u_{z1}$ and $u_{z2}$.\n\nThe displacement of the surface of body $1$, $u_{z1}$, is:\n$$ u_{z1}(x,y) = \\frac{1-\\nu_1^2}{\\pi E_1} \\iint_{\\Omega} \\frac{p(\\xi, \\eta)}{\\sqrt{(x-\\xi)^2 + (y-\\eta)^2}} d\\xi d\\eta $$\nAnd the displacement of the surface of body $2$, $u_{z2}$, is:\n$$ u_{z2}(x,y) = \\frac{1-\\nu_2^2}{\\pi E_2} \\iint_{\\Omega} \\frac{p(\\xi, \\eta)}{\\sqrt{(x-\\xi)^2 + (y-\\eta)^2}} d\\xi d\\eta $$\nThe total normal displacement, $u_z(x,y) = u_{z1}(x,y) + u_{z2}(x,y)$, is therefore:\n$$ u_z(x,y) = \\left( \\frac{1-\\nu_1^2}{\\pi E_1} + \\frac{1-\\nu_2^2}{\\pi E_2} \\right) \\iint_{\\Omega} \\frac{p(\\xi, \\eta)}{\\sqrt{(x-\\xi)^2 + (y-\\eta)^2}} d\\xi d\\eta $$\nWe can factor out the common integral term and combine the material properties:\n$$ u_z(x,y) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{1-\\nu_1^2}{E_1} + \\frac{1-\\nu_2^2}{E_2} \\right) \\iint_{\\Omega} \\frac{p(\\xi, \\eta)}{\\sqrt{(x-\\xi)^2 + (y-\\eta)^2}} d\\xi d\\eta $$\nThe problem requires us to define an effective modulus $E^*$ such that the displacement field depends on the material properties solely through this a single parameter. Comparing the above expression with the form for a single body, we can see that the entire material dependence is contained within the parenthesis. The standard definition of the Hertzian effective modulus $E^*$ is chosen to consolidate these terms:\n$$ \\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{1-\\nu_1^2}{E_1} + \\frac{1-\\nu_2^2}{E_2} $$\nWith this definition, the total displacement becomes:\n$$ u_z(x,y) = \\frac{1}{\\pi E^*} \\iint_{\\Omega} \\frac{p(\\xi, \\eta)}{\\sqrt{(x-\\xi)^2 + (y-\\eta)^2}} d\\xi d\\eta $$\nThis achieves the required formulation. The two-body contact problem is thus mapped onto an equivalent problem of a rigid body indenting an elastic half-space with modulus $E^*$ and an effective Poisson's ratio of $0$.\n\nNext, we evaluate $E^*$ for the given material properties: $E_1=210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $\\nu_1=0.3$, $E_2=70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, and $\\nu_2=0.2$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $1/E^*$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{1 - (0.3)^2}{210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} + \\frac{1 - (0.2)^2}{70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{1 - 0.09}{210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} + \\frac{1 - 0.04}{70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{0.91}{210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} + \\frac{0.96}{70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} $$\nTo combine the terms, we find a common denominator:\n$$ \\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{0.91}{210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} + \\frac{3 \\times 0.96}{3 \\times 70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} = \\frac{0.91 + 2.88}{210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} = \\frac{3.79}{210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} $$\nTherefore, the effective modulus $E^*$ is:\n$$ E^* = \\frac{210}{3.79}\\,\\mathrm{GPa} \\approx 55.40897\\,\\mathrm{GPa} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we obtain $E^* = 55.41\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$.\n\nFinally, we analyze the behavior of $E^*$ as $\\nu_1 \\to 0.5$ and $\\nu_2 \\to 0.5$. A Poisson's ratio of $\\nu=0.5$ corresponds to the limit of incompressibility for an isotropic elastic material.\nThe expression for $E^*$ is $E^* = \\left( \\frac{1-\\nu_1^2}{E_1} + \\frac{1-\\nu_2^2}{E_2} \\right)^{-1}$.\nAs $\\nu_i$ increases in the range $[0, 0.5]$, the term $(1-\\nu_i^2)$ decreases. Consequently, the sum $\\frac{1-\\nu_1^2}{E_1} + \\frac{1-\\nu_2^2}{E_2}$, which is equal to $1/E^*$, also decreases. Since $1/E^*$ is a decreasing function of $\\nu_1$ and $\\nu_2$, its reciprocal, $E^*$, must be an increasing function. Qualitatively, as the materials become more incompressible, an increasing normal force is required to achieve the same indentation depth, meaning the contact becomes effectively stiffer, which is reflected by a higher value of $E^*$.\n\nQuantitatively, we evaluate $E^*$ at the limit where $\\nu_1 = 0.5$ and $\\nu_2 = 0.5$:\n$$ \\lim_{\\nu_1, \\nu_2 \\to 0.5} \\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{1 - (0.5)^2}{210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} + \\frac{1 - (0.5)^2}{70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{E^*_{limit}} = \\frac{0.75}{210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} + \\frac{0.75}{70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} = 0.75 \\left( \\frac{1}{210} + \\frac{3}{210} \\right)\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{E^*_{limit}} = 0.75 \\left( \\frac{4}{210} \\right)\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1} = \\frac{3}{4} \\frac{4}{210}\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1} = \\frac{3}{210}\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{70}\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1} $$\nThus, the limiting value of the effective modulus is $E^*_{limit} = 70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$.\nComparing this to the value calculated for the given parameters ($E^* \\approx 55.41\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$), we see a quantitative increase of $E^*_{limit} - E^* \\approx 70 - 55.41 = 14.59\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$. This represents a substantial increase in contact stiffness of approximately $26.3\\%$. The effective modulus $E^*$ is bounded by the cases of $\\nu_1=\\nu_2=0$ ($E^*=52.5\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$) and $\\nu_1=\\nu_2=0.5$ ($E^*=70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$) for the given Young's moduli.\n\nThe requested final answer is the numerical value for $E^*$ rounded to four significant figures for the given parameters.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{55.41}\n$$", "id": "2891983"}, {"introduction": "Hertzian theory is not merely a theoretical construct; it is a powerful tool for experimental materials characterization, particularly in nanoindentation and microindentation.

Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe core task is to relate the applied load $P$ to the penetration depth $\\delta$. This relationship is central to Hertzian contact mechanics. For the specified configuration—a sphere indenting a flat half-space—the pressure distribution $p(r)$ over the circular contact area of radius $a$ is ellipsoidal:\n$$\np(r) = p_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^2}\n$$\nwhere $p_0$ is the maximum pressure at the center of contact ($r=0$).

First, the contact radius $a$ is related to the penetration depth $\\delta$ and the effective radius of curvature $R^*$ by the geometric constraint for small deformations:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{a^2}{R^*} \\quad \\implies \\quad a = \\sqrt{\\delta R^*}\n$$\nSecond, the contact radius $a$ is related to the load $P$ and the material properties through the effective modulus $E^*$:\n$$\na^3 = \\frac{3PR^*}{4E^*}\n$$\nThis relation is a direct consequence of integrating the surface displacements from the Boussinesq solution under the Hertzian pressure distribution. The effective modulus $E^*$ is defined by\n$$\n\\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{1-\\nu_1^2}{E_1} + \\frac{1-\\nu_2^2}{E_2}\n$$\nwhere ($E_1, \\nu_1$) are the properties of the indenter and ($E_2, \\nu_2$) are for the half-space.

The problem directs us to consider the stress state along the axis of symmetry (the $z$-axis, with $r=0$), where $z$ is the depth into the half-space measured from the surface. On this axis, the shear stress components are zero ($\\tau_{rz} = \\tau_{z\\theta} = \\tau_{r\\theta} = 0$), so the radial ($\\sigma_{rr}$), tangential ($\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}$), and axial ($\\sigma_{zz}$) stresses are the principal stresses.

As the problem asks for a single numerical answer, we assume a standard value for metallic materials, $\\nu=0.3$.\nFor $\\nu=0.3$, the equation becomes:\n$$ 1.3\\left[\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{\\zeta^*}\\right) - \\frac{\\zeta^*}{1+(\\zeta^*)^2}\\right] = \\frac{3\\zeta^*}{(1+(\\zeta^*)^2)^2} $$\nNumerical solution of this equation yields $\\zeta^* \\approx 0.4809$. This is the normalized depth $z/a$ at which yielding commences on the axis of symmetry. It is important to note that for $\\nu=0.3$, this is also the location of the global maximum of the von Mises stress in the entire half-space.\n\nNow, we evaluate $H(\\zeta^*)$ at $\\zeta^* = 0.4809$:\n$$ H(0.4809) = -1.3 + 1.3(0.4809)\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{0.4809}\\right) + \\frac{3}{2(1+(0.4809)^2)} $$\n$$ H(0.4809) = -1.3 + 1.3(0.4809)(1.1223) + \\frac{1.5}{1.23126} \\approx -1.3 + 0.7016 + 1.2183 \\approx 0.6199 $$\nSo, the maximum von Mises stress is $(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}})_{\\max} \\approx 0.6199 p_0$.\n\nYielding begins when this maximum stress equals the yield strength $\\sigma_y$. Let $p_{0,y}$ be the value of $p_0$ at the onset of yielding.\n$$ (\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}})_{\\max} = 0.6199 p_{0,y} = \\sigma_y $$\nSolving for the required ratio:\n$$ \\frac{p_{0,y}}{\\sigma_y} = \\frac{1}{0.6199} \\approx 1.6131 $$\n\n**Comparison with Tresca Criterion**\n\nThe Tresca (or maximum shear stress) criterion states that yielding occurs when the maximum shear stress $\\tau_{\\max}$ reaches a critical value. For a material with uniaxial tensile yield strength $\\sigma_y$, this critical value is $\\sigma_y/2$.\n$$ \\tau_{\\max} = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{2} $$\nThe maximum shear stress is given by $\\tau_{\\max} = \\frac{\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_3}{2}$, where $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_3$ are the maximum and minimum principal stresses, respectively.\nOn the axis of symmetry, the principal stresses are $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_{rr}$ and $\\sigma_3 = \\sigma_{zz}$ (since $|\\sigma_{zz}| > |\\sigma_{rr}|$, $\\sigma_{zz}$ is more negative). The maximum shear stress is:\n$$ \\tau_{\\max} = \\frac{\\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{zz}}{2} $$\nThe Tresca yield condition on the axis of symmetry is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{zz}}{2} = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{2} \\implies \\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{zz} = \\sigma_y $$\nThis is identical to the von Mises yield condition, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}} = |\\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{zz}| = \\sigma_y$, which we derived for the axis of symmetry.\n\nA criterion is more conservative if it predicts yielding at a lower applied load. To compare the two criteria, we must find where each criterion's governing stress measure is maximized.\n- For the von Mises criterion, with $\\nu=0.3$, the maximum of $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}/p_0$ occurs on the axis of symmetry ($r=0$) at $z \\approx 0.48a$.\n- For the Tresca criterion, with $\\nu=0.3$, the maximum of $\\tau_{\\max}/p_0$ also occurs on the axis of symmetry, at almost the same depth.\n\nSince both criteria have their critical locations on the axis of symmetry, and on this axis the mathematical forms of their yield conditions become identical ($\\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{zz} = \\sigma_y$), they will predict yielding at the same pressure $p_{0,y}$.\nTherefore, in this specific case of Hertzian contact on a material with $\\nu = 0.3$, neither the von Mises nor the Tresca criterion is more conservative than the other; their predictions are identical.\n\nThe final answer for the ratio $p_{0,y}/\\sigma_y$ based on the von Mises criterion, rounded to $4$ significant figures, is $1.613$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.613}$$", "id": "2891953"}]}
