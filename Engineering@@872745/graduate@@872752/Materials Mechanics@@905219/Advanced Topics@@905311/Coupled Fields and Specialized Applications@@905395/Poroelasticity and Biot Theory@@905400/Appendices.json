The derivation must begin from the fundamental constitutive relations of Biot's theory of poroelasticity.\n\nThe behavior of the porous medium under hydrostatic loading is described by the volumetric part of the isotropic Biot constitutive equations:\n$$ \\sigma = K_{d} \\epsilon - \\alpha p \\quad (1) $$\n$$ \\zeta = \\alpha \\epsilon + \\frac{1}{M} p \\quad (2) $$\nHere, $\\sigma$ is the mean total stress (defined as positive in tension, so for a confining pressure $\\sigma_c$, $\\sigma = -\\sigma_c$), $\\epsilon$ is the bulk volumetric strain, $p$ is the pore fluid pressure, and $\\zeta$ is the increment of fluid volume per unit bulk volume of the material. The coefficients are the drained bulk modulus $K_{d}$, the Biot-Willis coefficient $\\alpha$, and the Biot modulus $M$.\n\nThe Biot-Willis coefficient $\\alpha$ and the Biot modulus $M$ are not independent parameters. They are defined in terms of the fundamental properties of the solid and fluid constituents: the drained bulk modulus $K_{d}$, the bulk modulus of the solid grains $K_{s}$, the porosity $\\phi$, and the bulk modulus of the pore fluid $K_{f}$.
