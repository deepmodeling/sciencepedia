It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation proceeds as follows. A straight mixed dislocation with line direction $\\mathbf{t}$ and Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$ can be decomposed into a pure screw component and a pure edge component. The Burgers vector of the screw component, $\\mathbf{b}_s$, is the projection of $\\mathbf{b}$ onto $\\mathbf{t}$, and its magnitude is $b_s = b \\cos\\theta$. The Burgers vector of the edge component, $\\mathbf{b}_e$, is perpendicular to $\\mathbf{t}$, and its magnitude is $b_e = b \\sin\\theta$.\n\nIn linear elasticity, the principle of superposition applies to the displacement, strain, and stress fields. The total field is the sum of the fields from the screw and edge components. For a straight dislocation, the stress field of the screw component and the strain field of the edge component are orthogonal, meaning their product, summed over all indices, is zero: $\\sigma_{ij}^s \\varepsilon_{ij}^e = 0$. Consequently, the interaction energy term vanishes, and the total elastic energy per unit length, $E$, is the direct sum of the energy per unit length of the screw component, $E_s$, and the edge component, $E_e$.\n$$E = E_s + E_e$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy of the screw component, $E_s$. A pure screw dislocation with Burgers vector magnitude $b_s$ generates a pure shear stress field. In a cylindrical coordinate system $(r, \\phi, z)$ where the $z$-axis aligns with $\\mathbf{t}$, the only non-zero stress component is:\n$$\\sigma_{z\\phi} = \\sigma_{\\phi z} = \\frac{G b_s}{2 \\pi r}$$\nThe elastic strain energy density is given by $w = \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma_{ij} \\varepsilon_{ij}$. For an isotropic material under pure shear, this simplifies to $w_s = \\frac{1}{2G} \\sigma_{z\\phi}^2$. Substituting the stress field:\n$$w_s = \\frac{1}{2G} \\left( \\frac{G b_s}{2 \\pi r} \\right)^2 = \\frac{G b_s^2}{8 \\pi^2 r^2}$$\nTo find the energy per unit length $E_s$, we integrate $w_s$ over the cross-sectional area of the hollow cylinder from the core radius $r_0$ to the outer cutoff radius $R$.\n$$E_s = \\int_{r_0}^{R} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} w_s(r) \\, r \\, d\\phi \\, dr = \\int_{r_0}^{R} 2\\pi r \\left( \\frac{G b_s^2}{8 \\pi^2 r^2} \\right) dr$$\n$$E_s = \\frac{G b_s^2}{4 \\pi} \\int_{r_0}^{R} \\frac{dr}{r} = \\frac{G b_s^2}{4 \\pi} \\left[ \\ln(r) \\right]_{r_0}^{R} = \\frac{G b_s^2}{4 \\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_0}\\right)$$\nSubstituting $b_s = b \\cos\\theta$, the energy of the screw component is:\n$$E_s = \\frac{G b^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)}{4 \\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_0}\\right)$$\nIt is critical to observe that this expression for the screw dislocation energy is independent of Poisson's ratio, $\\nu$. This is because a pure screw dislocation only generates pure shear strains, and the material's response to pure shear in an isotropic medium is governed solely by the shear modulus $G$.\n\nNext, we calculate the energy of the edge component, $E_e$. For a pure edge dislocation with Burgers vector magnitude $b_e$, the stress field involves both normal and shear components and depends on both $G$ and $\\nu$ under the assumption of plane strain, which is appropriate for a long, straight dislocation. The energy per unit length for an edge dislocation is a standard result:\n$$E_e = \\frac{G b_e^2}{4 \\pi (1-\\nu)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_0}\\right)$$\nSubstituting $b_e = b \\sin\\theta$, the energy of the edge component is:\n$$E_e = \\frac{G b^2 \\sin^2(\\theta)}{4 \\pi (1-\\nu)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_0}\\right)$$\nIn contrast to the screw component, the energy of the edge component is dependent on Poisson's ratio $\\nu$ through the factor $(1-\\nu)$ in the denominator. This dependence arises because an edge dislocation creates regions of both compression and tension, thus involving volumetric changes in strain. The material's resistance to such changes is related to its bulk modulus, which is a function of both $G$ and $\\nu$.\n\nFinally, the total elastic energy per unit length, $E$, is the sum $E_s+E_e$.\n$$E = E_s + E_e = \\frac{G b^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)}{4 \\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_0}\\right) + \\frac{G b^2 \\sin^2(\\theta)}{4 \\pi (1-\\nu)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_0}\\right)$$\nFactoring out the common terms yields the final closed-form expression for the total energy per unit length of the mixed dislocation.\n$$E = \\frac{G b^2}{4 \\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_0}\\right) \\left( \\cos^2(\\theta) + \\frac{\\sin^2(\\theta)}{1-\\nu} \\right)$$\nThis expression correctly reduces to the pure screw case ($E_s$) for $\\theta=0$ and to the pure edge case ($E_e$) for $\\theta=\\pi/2$.

The given numerical values are physically realistic for a metallic crystal. The inclusion of Poisson's ratio, $\\nu$, while not required for the calculation of screw dislocation energy, does not invalidate the problem; it serves as a check of fundamental knowledge, as the energy of a screw dislocation is independent of $\\nu$.\n\nThe solution proceeds.\n\nFirst, we verify the conservation of the Burgers vector at the node. The reaction is given as $\\mathbf{b}_{1} + \\mathbf{b}_{2} \\to \\mathbf{b}_{3}$. For the Burgers vector to be conserved, the sum of the incoming vectors must equal the outgoing vector, i.e., $\\mathbf{b}_{1} + \\mathbf{b}_{2} = \\mathbf{b}_{3}$.\n\nWe compute the sum:\n$$ \\mathbf{b}_{1} + \\mathbf{b}_{2} = \\frac{a}{2}[1\\,1\\,0] + \\frac{a}{2}[-1\\,0\\,1] = \\frac{a}{2}\\left([1,1,0] + [-1,0,1]\\right) $$\n$$ = \\frac{a}{2}[1-1, 1+0, 0+1] = \\frac{a}{2}[0\\,1\\,1] $$\nThis result is identical to the given vector $\\mathbf{b}_{3}$. Thus, $\\mathbf{b}_{1} + \\mathbf{b}_{2} = \\mathbf{b}_{3}$ is confirmed. The Burgers vector is conserved, as is required for any physically valid dislocation node.\n\nNext, we calculate the change in total line energy per unit length, $\\Delta U/L$. The energy per unit length, $U/L$, for a straight screw dislocation in an isotropic elastic medium is given by the formula:\n$$ \\frac{U_{\\text{screw}}}{L} = \\frac{\\mu b^2}{4\\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_{0}}\\right) $$\nwhere $b$ is the magnitude of the Burgers vector, $|\\mathbf{b}|$. This expression correctly depends only on the shear modulus $\\mu$ and is independent of Poisson's ratio $\\nu$.\n\nThe change in energy per unit length for the reaction is:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta U}{L} = \\frac{U_{3}}{L} - \\left(\\frac{U_{1}}{L} + \\frac{U_{2}}{L}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the energy formula for each of the three screw dislocations:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta U}{L} = \\frac{\\mu b_{3}^2}{4\\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_{0}}\\right) - \\left( \\frac{\\mu b_{1}^2}{4\\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_{0}}\\right) + \\frac{\\mu b_{2}^2}{4\\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_{0}}\\right) \\right) $$\nFactoring out the common terms yields:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta U}{L} = \\frac{\\mu}{4\\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_{0}}\\right) \\left( b_{3}^2 - (b_{1}^2 + b_{2}^2) \\right) $$\nThis expression is a direct application of Frank's energy criterion, which states that a dislocation reaction is energetically favorable if the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the product Burgers vectors is less than the sum for the reactant vectors.\n\nWe must now compute the squared magnitudes ($b^2$) of the given Burgers vectors:\nFor $\\mathbf{b}_{1} = \\frac{a}{2}[1\\,1\\,0]$:\n$$ b_{1}^2 = |\\mathbf{b}_{1}|^2 = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 (1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2) = \\frac{a^2}{4}(2) = \\frac{a^2}{2} $$\nFor $\\mathbf{b}_{2} = \\frac{a}{2}[-1\\,0\\,1]$:\n$$ b_{2}^2 = |\\mathbf{b}_{2}|^2 = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 ((-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2) = \\frac{a^2}{4}(2) = \\frac{a^2}{2} $$\nFor $\\mathbf{b}_{3} = \\frac{a}{2}[0\\,1\\,1]$:\n$$ b_{3}^2 = |\\mathbf{b}_{3}|^2 = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 (0^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = \\frac{a^2}{4}(2) = \\frac{a^2}{2} $$\nAll three Burgers vectors are of the type $\\frac{a}{2}\\langle 110 \\rangle$ and thus have the same magnitude, as expected.\n\nSubstituting these magnitudes into the Frank criterion term:\n$$ b_{3}^2 - (b_{1}^2 + b_{2}^2) = \\frac{a^2}{2} - \\left(\\frac{a^2}{2} + \\frac{a^2}{2}\\right) = \\frac{a^2}{2} - a^2 = -\\frac{a^2}{2} $$\nThe change in energy per unit length is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta U}{L} = \\frac{\\mu}{4\\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_{0}}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{a^2}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{\\mu a^2}{8\\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_{0}}\\right) $$\nSince all parameters ($\\mu, a, R, r_{0}$) are positive and $R  r_{0}$, the logarithmic term is positive.

Slip on $\\{100\\}$ planes in FCC materials requires a much higher stress than slip on $\\{111\\}$ planes and does not typically occur under normal conditions.\nSince the only plane on which the product dislocation can glide is the $(010)$ plane, and this is not a favorable slip plane, the dislocation is effectively immobile with respect to glide. It is therefore sessile. This immobility is the reason it is called a \"lock,\" as it acts as a strong barrier to the motion of other dislocations.\n\n3) Computation of the magnitude $|\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{L}}|$ and the ratio $|\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{L}}|/a$.\n\nThe Burgers vector of the product dislocation is $\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{L}} = \\frac{a}{2}[1\\,\\,0\\,\\,1]$. Its magnitude is calculated using the standard formula for a vector's Euclidean norm.\n$$\n\\left|\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{L}}\\right| = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{a}{2} \\cdot 1\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{a}{2} \\cdot 0\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{a}{2} \\cdot 1\\right)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\left|\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{L}}\\right| = \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{a^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2a^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\left|\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{L}}\\right| = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the single number representing the ratio $\\left|\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{L}}\\right|/a$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\left|\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{L}}\\right|}{a} = \\frac{1}{a} \\left(\\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}$$", "id": "2878736"}]}
