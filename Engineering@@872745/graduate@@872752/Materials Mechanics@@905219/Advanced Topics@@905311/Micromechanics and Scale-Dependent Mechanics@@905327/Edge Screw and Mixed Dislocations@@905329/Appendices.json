It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The concepts of dislocations, Burgers vectors, and crystallographic planes in an face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice are standard in materials science. We will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to determine the character of a dislocation by computing the angle $\\chi$ between its line direction vector $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ and its Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$. The character is defined as pure screw if $\\chi$ is $0$ or $\\pi$ radians, pure edge if $\\chi$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians, and mixed for all other values of $\\chi$.\n\nFor a cubic crystal system, the crystallographic direction $[u, v, w]$ can be represented by a vector $\\mathbf{v} = u\\hat{\\mathbf{i}} + v\\hat{\\mathbf{j}} + w\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}$ in a standard orthonormal Cartesian basis.\n\nThe dislocation line direction $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ is given as parallel to the crystallographic direction $[1, 1, -2]$.

A vector lies in a plane if it is orthogonal to the plane's normal vector. The normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$ to a plane with Miller indices $(h, k, l)$ in a cubic system is given by $\\mathbf{n} = h\\hat{\\mathbf{i}} + k\\hat{\\mathbf{j}} + l\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}$.
