It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. The problem requires a solution derived from first principles, which is a valid pedagogical constraint. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem investigates the strain field within a spherical inclusion embedded in an infinite matrix. The inclusion and matrix share the same isotropic linear elastic properties, defined by Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$. The system is subjected to a uniform isotropic eigenstrain $\\varepsilon^{*} = \\varepsilon_{0}\\mathbf{I}$ within the inclusion and a uniform remote strain $\\varepsilon^{\\infty}$. The governing equations are those of small-strain elastostatics: equilibrium ($\\nabla \\cdot \\sigma = \\mathbf{0}$), kinematics ($\\varepsilon = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla\\mathbf{u})^{\\mathrm{T}})$), and the constitutive law with eigenstrain, which for an isotropic material is $\\sigma = \\lambda (\\mathrm{tr}(\\varepsilon - \\varepsilon^{*})) \\mathbf{I} + 2\\mu(\\varepsilon - \\varepsilon^{*})$. Here, $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ are the Lamé parameters, $\\sigma$ is the Cauchy stress tensor, $\\varepsilon$ is the total strain tensor, and $\\mathbf{u}$ is the displacement vector.\n\nFirst, we address the decomposition of the problem. The governing equations are linear. Therefore, the principle of superposition is applicable. The total solution for the displacement $\\mathbf{u}$, strain $\\varepsilon$, and stress $\\sigma$ can be expressed as the sum of solutions to two simpler boundary value problems:\n(i) A problem with the prescribed eigenstrain $\\varepsilon^{*}$ in the inclusion and zero remote strain ($\\varepsilon^{\\infty} = \\mathbf{0}$). Let the solution fields for this case be $\\mathbf{u}^{(\\mathrm{i})}$, $\\varepsilon^{(\\mathrm{i})}$, and $\\sigma^{(\\mathrm{i})}$.\n(ii) A problem with zero eigenstrain ($\\varepsilon^{*} = \\mathbf{0}$) and the prescribed remote strain $\\varepsilon^{\\infty}$. Let the solution fields be $\\mathbf{u}^{(\\mathrm{ii})}$, $\\varepsilon^{(\\mathrm{ii})}$, and $\\sigma^{(\\mathrm{ii})}$.\nThe total strain inside the inclusion will be $\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{in}} = \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{in},(\\mathrm{i})} + \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{in},(\\mathrm{ii})}$.\n\nFor case (ii), the entire body (matrix and inclusion) is homogeneous, as they share the same elastic properties, and there is no internal source of stress like an eigenstrain. The body is subjected to a uniform strain $\\varepsilon^{\\infty}$ at infinity. A uniform strain field $\\varepsilon^{(\\mathrm{ii})}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\varepsilon^{\\infty}$ everywhere is a valid solution. This field corresponds to a uniform stress field $\\sigma^{(\\mathrm{ii})}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{C}:\\varepsilon^{\\infty}$, which trivially satisfies the equilibrium equation $\\nabla \\cdot \\sigma^{(\\mathrm{ii})} = \\mathbf{0}$. The strain field, being constant, also satisfies the compatibility conditions. Finally, it meets the boundary condition at infinity. By the uniqueness of the solution in linear elasticity, this must be the correct solution. Therefore, the strain inside the inclusion for this case is uniform and equal to the applied remote strain: $\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{in},(\\mathrm{ii})} = \\varepsilon^{\\infty}$.\n\nNext, we solve case (i). We have a spherical inclusion of radius $a$ with a uniform isotropic eigenstrain $\\varepsilon^{*} = \\varepsilon_{0}\\mathbf{I}$ in an infinite homogeneous matrix, with zero strain at infinity. The spherical symmetry of the problem dictates that the displacement field must be purely radial, i.e., in spherical coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$, $\\mathbf{u} = u_{r}(r)\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_{r}$.\nThe general solution for the radial displacement in such problems takes the form $u_{r}(r) = Ar + B/r^{2}$.\nInside the inclusion ($r \\le a$), the displacement must be finite at the origin $r=0$. This requires $B=0$, so the displacement is $u_{r}^{\\mathrm{in}}(r) = Ar$. This leads to a uniform, hydrostatic strain state within the inclusion:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{rr}^{\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{du_{r}^{\\mathrm{in}}}{dr} = A $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta}^{\\mathrm{in}} = \\varepsilon_{\\phi\\phi}^{\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{u_{r}^{\\mathrm{in}}}{r} = A $$\nThus, the strain tensor inside is $\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{in}, (\\mathrm{i})} = A\\mathbf{I}$.\n\nOutside the inclusion ($r \\ge a$), the strain must vanish as $r \\to \\infty$. The term $Ar$ would produce a constant strain, so for the exterior field, we must have $A=0$. The displacement is thus $u_{r}^{\\mathrm{out}}(r) = D/r^{2}$ for some constant $D$. The corresponding strain components are:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{rr}^{\\mathrm{out}} = \\frac{du_{r}^{\\mathrm{out}}}{dr} = -\\frac{2D}{r^{3}} $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta}^{\\mathrm{out}} = \\varepsilon_{\\phi\\phi}^{\\mathrm{out}} = \\frac{u_{r}^{\\mathrm{out}}}{r} = \\frac{D}{r^{3}} $$\nThe volumetric strain outside is $\\mathrm{tr}(\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{out}}) = \\varepsilon_{rr}^{\\mathrm{out}} + \\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta}^{\\mathrm{out}} + \\varepsilon_{\\phi\\phi}^{\\mathrm{out}} = 0$.\n\nAt the interface $r=a$, both displacement and traction must be continuous.\nContinuity of displacement requires $u_{r}^{\\mathrm{in}}(a) = u_{r}^{\\mathrm{out}}(a)$, which gives $Aa = D/a^{2}$, or $D=Aa^{3}$.\n\nContinuity of the radial stress component, $\\sigma_{rr}$, is required for traction continuity. Let's compute the stresses.\nInside the inclusion, the elastic strain is $\\varepsilon^{e} = \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{in},(\\mathrm{i})} - \\varepsilon^{*} = (A-\\varepsilon_{0})\\mathbf{I}$. This is a pure dilatation. The stress is given by $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{in}} = 3\\kappa \\varepsilon^{e} = 3\\kappa(A-\\varepsilon_{0})\\mathbf{I}$, where $\\kappa$ is the bulk modulus. So, the radial stress is $\\sigma_{rr}^{\\mathrm{in}} = 3\\kappa(A-\\varepsilon_{0})$.\n\nOutside the inclusion, $\\varepsilon^{*} = \\mathbf{0}$. The volumetric strain is zero, so the stress is determined by the shear modulus $\\mu$. The stress components are $\\sigma_{rr}^{\\mathrm{out}} = 2\\mu\\varepsilon_{rr}^{\\mathrm{out}} = -4\\mu D/r^{3}$ and $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}^{\\mathrm{out}} = 2\\mu\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta}^{\\mathrm{out}} = 2\\mu D/r^{3}$.\n\nApplying stress continuity at $r=a$:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr}^{\\mathrm{in}}(a) = \\sigma_{rr}^{\\mathrm{out}}(a) $$\n$$ 3\\kappa(A-\\varepsilon_{0}) = -4\\mu \\frac{D}{a^{3}} $$\nSubstituting $D = Aa^{3}$ into this equation:\n$$ 3\\kappa(A-\\varepsilon_{0}) = -4\\mu A $$\n$$ 3\\kappa A - 3\\kappa\\varepsilon_{0} = -4\\mu A $$\n$$ (3\\kappa + 4\\mu)A = 3\\kappa\\varepsilon_{0} $$\nSolving for $A$:\n$$ A = \\frac{3\\kappa}{3\\kappa + 4\\mu}\\varepsilon_{0} $$\nThe strain inside the inclusion for case (i) is $\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{in},(\\mathrm{i})} = A\\mathbf{I} = \\frac{3\\kappa}{3\\kappa + 4\\mu}\\varepsilon_{0}\\mathbf{I}$.\n\nTo express this in terms of Poisson's ratio $\\nu$, we use the relations $\\kappa = \\frac{E}{3(1-2\\nu)}$ and $\\mu = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}$.\n$$ A = \\frac{3\\frac{E}{3(1-2\\nu)}}{3\\frac{E}{3(1-2\\nu)} + 4\\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}}\\varepsilon_{0} = \\frac{\\frac{E}{1-2\\nu}}{\\frac{E}{1-2\\nu} + \\frac{2E}{1+\\nu}}\\varepsilon_{0} $$\n$$ A = \\frac{\\frac{1}{1-2\\nu}}{\\frac{1+\\nu+2(1-2\\nu)}{(1-2\\nu)(1+\\nu)}}\\varepsilon_{0} = \\frac{1+\\nu}{1+\\nu+2-4\\nu}\\varepsilon_{0} = \\frac{1+\\nu}{3-3\\nu}\\varepsilon_{0} $$\n$$ A = \\frac{1+\\nu}{3(1-\\nu)}\\varepsilon_{0} $$\nSo, for case (i), the strain is $\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{in},(\\mathrm{i})} = \\frac{1+\\nu}{3(1-\\nu)}\\varepsilon_{0}\\mathbf{I}$.\n\nFinally, we combine the results from the two sub-problems using superposition to find the total strain inside the inclusion:\n$$ \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{in}} = \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{in},(\\mathrm{i})} + \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{in},(\\mathrm{ii})} = \\frac{1+\\nu}{3(1-\\nu)}\\varepsilon_{0}\\mathbf{I} + \\varepsilon^{\\infty} $$\nThe problem asks for the component $\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{in}}_{11}$. From the tensor equation above, we extract the component for $i=1, j=1$:\n$$ \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{in}}_{11} = \\left( \\frac{1+\\nu}{3(1-\\nu)}\\varepsilon_{0}\\mathbf{I} + \\varepsilon^{\\infty} \\right)_{11} $$\n$$ \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{in}}_{11} = \\frac{1+\\nu}{3(1-\\nu)}\\varepsilon_{0}\\delta_{11} + \\varepsilon^{\\infty}_{11} $$\nSince $\\delta_{11}=1$, we obtain the final expression:\n$$ \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{in}}_{11} = \\varepsilon^{\\infty}_{11} + \\frac{1+\\nu}{3(1-\\nu)}\\varepsilon_{0} $$\nThis expression gives the total strain's $11$-component inside the inclusion as a function of the remote strain component $\\varepsilon^{\\infty}_{11}$, the eigenstrain magnitude $\\varepsilon_{0}$, and the material's Poisson's ratio $\\nu$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\varepsilon^{\\infty}_{11} + \\frac{1+\\nu}{3(1-\\nu)}\\varepsilon_{0}}\n$$", "id": "2884851"}, {"introduction": "Building on the eigenstrain concept, we now address the more practical case of an elastic inhomogeneity, where the inclusion has different mechanical properties than the surrounding matrix.

Second, the Eshelby formalism for a spherical inclusion is introduced, with its tensor properties decomposed into scalar factors. Third, the Mori–Tanaka effective medium theory is formulated using these scalar factors to derive expressions for the effective bulk and shear moduli. Finally, numerical values are computed.\n\nAn isotropic linear elastic material is characterized by its stiffness tensor $C_{ijkl}$, which can be expressed using two independent elastic constants, such as the bulk modulus $K$ and shear modulus $G$. The stress tensor $\\sigma_{ij}$ and strain tensor $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ are related by $\\sigma_{ij} = C_{ijkl}\\varepsilon_{kl}$. By decomposing the tensors into their volumetric (isotropic) and deviatoric parts, the constitutive law is separated into two scalar equations:\n$$ \\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_{kk} = K \\varepsilon_{kk} $$\n$$ \\sigma'_{ij} = 2G \\varepsilon'_{ij} $$\nwhere $\\sigma'_{ij} = \\sigma_{ij} - \\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_{ll}\\delta_{ij}$ and $\\varepsilon'_{ij} = \\varepsilon_{ij} - \\frac{1}{3}\\varepsilon_{ll}\\delta_{ij}$ are the deviatoric stress and strain tensors, respectively. The bulk and shear moduli are related to Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$ by:\n$$ K = \\frac{E}{3(1-2\\nu)}, \\quad G = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)} $$\nFirst, we convert the given properties of the matrix ($m$) and inclusion ($i$) phases.\nFor the matrix:\n$E_{m} = 70~\\mathrm{GPa}$, $\\nu_{m} = 0.33$.\n$$ K_m = \\frac{70}{3(1-2 \\times 0.33)} = \\frac{70}{3(0.34)} \\approx 68.627~\\mathrm{GPa} $$\n$$ G_m = \\frac{70}{2(1+0.33)} = \\frac{70}{2.66} \\approx 26.316~\\mathrm{GPa} $$\nFor the inclusions:\n$E_{i} = 200~\\mathrm{GPa}$, $\\nu_{i} = 0.25$.\n$$ K_i = \\frac{200}{3(1-2 \\times 0.25)} = \\frac{200}{1.5} \\approx 133.333~\\mathrm{GPa} $$\n$$ G_i = \\frac{200}{2(1+0.25)} = \\frac{200}{2.5} = 80~\\mathrm{GPa} $$\n\nThe Eshelby problem relates the strain inside a single ellipsoidal inclusion to a uniform transformation strain. The relation is mediated by the Eshelby tensor $S_{ijkl}$, which depends only on the inclusion shape and the matrix Poisson's ratio. For a spherical inclusion in an isotropic matrix with Poisson's ratio $\\nu_m$, the tensor $S_{ijkl}$ is isotropic and can be decomposed into scalar factors for its volumetric and deviatoric parts. These scalar factors, which we denote by $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, are:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{1+\\nu_m}{3(1-\\nu_m)} $$\n$$ \\beta = \\frac{2(4-5\\nu_m)}{15(1-\\nu_m)} $$\nSubstituting $\\nu_m = 0.33$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{1+0.33}{3(1-0.33)} = \\frac{1.33}{2.01} \\approx 0.66169 $$\n$$ \\beta = \\frac{2(4-5 \\times 0.33)}{15(1-0.33)} = \\frac{2(4-1.65)}{15(0.67)} = \\frac{4.7}{10.05} \\approx 0.46766 $$\n\nThe Mori–Tanaka scheme provides expressions for the effective moduli of the composite. It accounts for inclusion interactions by assuming that each inclusion behaves as a single inclusion in an infinite matrix subjected to the average strain field of the matrix phase. For a two-phase composite with spherical inclusions, this leads to the following expressions for the effective bulk modulus $K_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and shear modulus $G_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$ K_{\\mathrm{eff}} = K_m + \\frac{c(K_i-K_m)}{1+(1-c)\\alpha\\frac{K_i-K_m}{K_m}} $$\n$$ G_{\\mathrm{eff}} = G_m + \\frac{c(G_i-G_m)}{1+(1-c)\\beta\\frac{G_i-G_m}{G_m}} $$\nHere, $c$ is the volume fraction of the inclusions.
