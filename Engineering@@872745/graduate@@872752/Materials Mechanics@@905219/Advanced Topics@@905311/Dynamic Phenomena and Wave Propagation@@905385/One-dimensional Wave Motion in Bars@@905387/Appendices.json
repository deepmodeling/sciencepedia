The problem is deemed valid and a complete solution will be developed from first principles as required.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Reflection Coefficient $\\mathcal{R}(\\omega)$\n\nWe begin with the fundamental laws governing longitudinal motion in the elastic bar. Let $u(x,t)$ be the longitudinal displacement of a cross-section at position $x$ and time $t$. The bar occupies the region $x \\ge 0$.\n\nNewton's second law is applied to a differential element of the bar between $x$ and $x+dx$. The mass of this element is $dm = \\rho A dx$, where $\\rho$ is the mass density and $A$ is the cross-sectional area. The net force on the element is due to the stress $\\sigma$. The force on the face at $x$ is $-A\\sigma(x,t)$ and on the face at $x+dx$ is $A\\sigma(x+dx,t)$. The net force is $dF = A\\sigma(x+dx,t) - A\\sigma(x,t) \\approx A \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x} dx$. Newton's second law, $dF = (dm) \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2}$, becomes:\n$$\nA \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x} dx = (\\rho A dx) \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} \\implies \\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x}\n$$\n\nHooke's law for a linearly elastic material in one dimension relates stress $\\sigma$ to strain $\\epsilon$. The strain is the spatial derivative of displacement, $\\epsilon = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$.\n$$\n\\sigma(x,t) = E \\epsilon(x,t) = E \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\n$$\nwhere $E$ is Young's modulus.\n\nSubstituting Hooke's law into Newton's law yields the one-dimensional wave equation:\n$$\n\\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( E \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\right)\n$$\nFor a uniform bar, $E$ and $\\rho$ are constant, leading to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = \\frac{E}{\\rho} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\equiv c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nwhere $c = \\sqrt{E/\\rho}$ is the longitudinal wave speed.\n\nWe consider time-harmonic waves of angular frequency $\\omega$. The displacement, particle velocity $v = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}$, and stress can be represented in complex form:\n$u(x,t) = \\hat{u}(x) e^{i\\omega t}$, $v(x,t) = \\hat{v}(x) e^{i\\omega t}$, $\\sigma(x,t) = \\hat{\\sigma}(x) e^{i\\omega t}$.\nFrom $v=\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}$, we have $\\hat{v}(x) = i\\omega \\hat{u}(x)$.\nSubstituting the harmonic form for $u(x,t)$ into the wave equation gives the Helmholtz equation for the complex displacement amplitude $\\hat{u}(x)$:\n$$\n-\\omega^2 \\hat{u}(x) = c^2 \\frac{d^2 \\hat{u}}{dx^2} \\implies \\frac{d^2 \\hat{u}}{dx^2} + k^2 \\hat{u}(x) = 0\n$$\nwhere $k=\\omega/c$ is the wavenumber.\n\nThe general solution represents waves traveling in both directions. The problem states an incident wave from the interior of the bar ($x>0$) travels towards the termination at $x=0$. This is a wave traveling in the $-x$ direction. The reflected wave travels away from the termination, in the $+x$ direction.\nThe total particle velocity field is a superposition of incident ($I$) and reflected ($R$) waves:\n$$\nv(x,t) = (\\hat{v}_{I} e^{ikx} + \\hat{v}_{R} e^{-ikx}) e^{i\\omega t}\n$$\nHere, $\\hat{v}_{I}$ is the complex amplitude of the incident velocity wave at $x=0$, and $\\hat{v}_{R}$ is that of the reflected wave.\n\nThe corresponding stress field is found using the relation $\\sigma = E \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = E \\int \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} dt$. In the frequency domain, $\\hat{\\sigma} = \\frac{E}{i\\omega} \\frac{d \\hat{v}}{dx}$.\n$$\n\\hat{\\sigma}(x) = \\frac{E}{i\\omega} (ik \\hat{v}_{I} e^{ikx} - ik \\hat{v}_{R} e^{-ikx}) = \\frac{Ek}{\\omega} (\\hat{v}_{I} e^{ikx} - \\hat{v}_{R} e^{-ikx})\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{Ek}{\\omega} = \\frac{E(\\omega/c)}{\\omega} = \\frac{E}{c} = \\frac{E}{\\sqrt{E/\\rho}} = \\sqrt{E\\rho}$. This is the specific acoustic impedance of the bar material, which we denote as $Z_0 = \\sqrt{E\\rho}$.\nThus, the complex stress amplitude is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\sigma}(x) = Z_0 (\\hat{v}_{I} e^{ikx} - \\hat{v}_{R} e^{-ikx})\n$$\n\nNext, we formulate the boundary condition at $x=0$. The end of the bar is connected to a linear viscous dashpot of coefficient $c_d$. The force exerted by the bar on the termination system at $x=0$ is $F_{bar} = A\\sigma(0,t)$. The dashpot is connected to a rigid wall, so its velocity is determined by the bar's end motion, $v(0,t)$. The force exerted by the dashpot on the bar is a resistive force, $F_{d} = -c_d v(0,t)$. By Newton's third law (action-reaction), the force exerted by the bar on the dashpot must be equal and opposite to the force exerted by the dashpot on the bar.\n$$\nF_{bar} = -F_{d} \\implies A\\sigma(0,t) = -(-c_d v(0,t)) = c_d v(0,t)\n$$\nIn terms of complex amplitudes, this boundary condition is:\n$$\nA \\hat{\\sigma}(0) = c_d \\hat{v}(0)\n$$\nWe evaluate the velocity and stress amplitudes at $x=0$:\n$$\n\\hat{v}(0) = \\hat{v}_{I} + \\hat{v}_{R}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{\\sigma}(0) = Z_0 (\\hat{v}_{I} - \\hat{v}_{R})\n$$\nSubstituting these into the boundary condition equation:\n$$\nA Z_0 (\\hat{v}_{I} - \\hat{v}_{R}) = c_d (\\hat{v}_{I} + \\hat{v}_{R})\n$$\nThe characteristic impedance of the bar is $Z_b = A Z_0 = A\\sqrt{E\\rho}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\nZ_b (\\hat{v}_{I} - \\hat{v}_{R}) = c_d (\\hat{v}_{I} + \\hat{v}_{R})\n$$\nWe rearrange to solve for the reflection coefficient $\\mathcal{R}(\\omega) = \\hat{v}_{R}/\\hat{v}_{I}$:\n$$\nZ_b \\hat{v}_{I} - Z_b \\hat{v}_{R} = c_d \\hat{v}_{I} + c_d \\hat{v}_{R}\n$$\n$$\n(Z_b - c_d)\\hat{v}_{I} = (Z_b + c_d)\\hat{v}_{R}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}(\\omega) = \\frac{\\hat{v}_{R}}{\\hat{v}_{I}} = \\frac{Z_b - c_d}{Z_b + c_d}\n$$\nSubstituting $Z_b = A\\sqrt{E\\rho}$, we obtain the final expression for the reflection coefficient:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}(\\omega) = \\frac{A\\sqrt{E\\rho} - c_d}{A\\sqrt{E\\rho} + c_d}\n$$\nThe parameters $A$, $E$, $\\rho$, and $c_d$ are all given as constants. Therefore, the reflection coefficient $\\mathcal{R}$ is independent of the angular frequency $\\omega$.\n\nPart 2: Optimization of the Dashpot Coefficient $c_d$\n\nThe design objective is to minimize the cost functional:\n$$\nJ(c_{d}) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{\\omega_{2}-\\omega_{1}} \\int_{\\omega_{1}}^{\\omega_{2}} \\left|\\mathcal{R}(\\omega)\\right|^{2}\\, \\mathrm{d}\\omega\n$$\nAs established in Part 1, $\\mathcal{R}(\\omega)$ is not a function of $\\omega$. We denote it simply as $\\mathcal{R}$. The term $|\\mathcal{R}|^2$ is a constant with respect to the integration variable $\\omega$.\n$$\nJ(c_d) = |\\mathcal{R}|^2 \\frac{1}{\\omega_2 - \\omega_1} \\int_{\\omega_1}^{\\omega_2} d\\omega = |\\mathcal{R}|^2 \\frac{\\omega_2 - \\omega_1}{\\omega_2 - \\omega_1} = |\\mathcal{R}|^2\n$$\nThe cost functional simplifies to the squared magnitude of the reflection coefficient:\n$$\nJ(c_d) = \\left| \\frac{A\\sqrt{E\\rho} - c_d}{A\\sqrt{E\\rho} + c_d} \\right|^2\n$$\nSince all quantities are real, this is:\n$$\nJ(c_d) = \\left( \\frac{A\\sqrt{E\\rho} - c_d}{A\\sqrt{E\\rho} + c_d} \\right)^2\n$$\nTo minimize $J(c_d)$, we must find the value of $c_d$ that minimizes this expression. The function $f(x) = (\\frac{a-x}{a+x})^2$ for positive $a$ and $x$ is minimized when its numerator is zero, provided the denominator is non-zero. The minimum value of $J(c_d)$ is $0$, which occurs when the numerator is zero.\n$$\nA\\sqrt{E\\rho} - c_d = 0\n$$\nThis gives the optimal dashpot coefficient:\n$$\nc_{d,opt} = A\\sqrt{E\\rho}\n$$\nThis condition is known as impedance matching, where the dashpot impedance $c_d$ is matched to the characteristic impedance of the bar $Z_b = A\\sqrt{E\\rho}$, resulting in zero reflection and perfect absorption of the incident wave energy. The given bandwidth $[\\omega_1, \\omega_2]$ is irrelevant to finding the optimal $c_d$ because of the frequency-independent nature of $\\mathcal{R}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value for $c_{d,opt}$ using the provided data:\n$E = 70.0 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\text{Pa}$\n$\\rho = 2700\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$\n$A = 1.00 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{m}^{2}$\n$$\nc_{d,opt} = (1.00 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{m}^2) \\sqrt{(70.0 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\text{Pa}) \\times (2700\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-3})}\n$$\n$$\nc_{d,opt} = (1.00 \\times 10^{-4}) \\sqrt{1.89 \\times 10^{14}} \\,\\,\\, \\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{s}}\n$$\n$$\nc_{d,opt} = (1.00 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times (1.37477... \\times 10^{7}) \\,\\,\\, \\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{s}}\n$$\n$$\nc_{d,opt} = 1374.77... \\,\\,\\, \\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{s}}\n$$\nThe unit $\\text{kg}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$ is equivalent to $\\text{N}\\cdot \\text{s}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$.

Given the convention that compressive strain $\\epsilon$ is positive and velocity $v$ is positive in the $+x$ direction, these equations are:\nBalance of Linear Momentum: $\\frac{\\partial\\sigma}{\\partial x} = -\\rho \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t}$\nKinematic Compatibility: $\\frac{\\partial\\epsilon}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}$\n\nThe constitutive law is given as $\\sigma = E\\epsilon + \\beta\\epsilon^2$. We can express the derivative of stress with respect to strain as $\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\epsilon} = E + 2\\beta\\epsilon$. Substituting this into the momentum equation by applying the chain rule ($\\frac{\\partial\\sigma}{\\partial x} = \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\epsilon}\\frac{\\partial\\epsilon}{\\partial x}$), we get the following system of first-order partial differential equations:\n$$\n(E + 2\\beta\\epsilon)\\frac{\\partial\\epsilon}{\\partial x} + \\rho\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial\\epsilon}{\\partial t} = 0\n$$\nThis is a hyperbolic system that can be solved using the Method of Characteristics. The characteristic speeds $\\lambda = dx/dt$ are given by the eigenvalues of the system's matrix, which are found to be $\\lambda = \\pm c(\\epsilon)$, where $c(\\epsilon)$ is the local wave speed:\n$$\nc(\\epsilon) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\epsilon}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{E + 2\\beta\\epsilon}{\\rho}}\n$$\nLet $c_0 = \\sqrt{E/\\rho}$ be the linear elastic wave speed. For small strains, as justified by the \"small kinematics\" assumption, we can approximate $c(\\epsilon)$ by a first-order Taylor expansion:\n$$\nc(\\epsilon) = c_0 \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2\\beta\\epsilon}{E}} \\approx c_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{\\beta\\epsilon}{E}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem describes a simple wave propagating into a medium initially at rest ($\\epsilon=0, v=0$). For a simple wave, there is a functional relationship between $v$ and $\\epsilon$. This relationship is derived from the Riemann invariants. For the characteristics propagating from the undisturbed region into the wave, the invariant holds, leading to the relation $v = \\int_0^\\epsilon c(\\epsilon') d\\epsilon'$. Using our approximation for $c(\\epsilon')$:\n$$\nv \\approx \\int_0^\\epsilon c_0\\left(1 + \\frac{\\beta\\epsilon'}{E}\\right) d\\epsilon' = c_0\\left(\\epsilon + \\frac{\\beta}{2E}\\epsilon^2\\right)\n$$\nFor small strains, the leading-order term is $v \\approx c_0\\epsilon$, or $\\epsilon \\approx v/c_0$.\n\nThe characteristics that form the simple wave are straight lines in the $x-t$ plane, originating from the boundary $x=0$. A characteristic generated at time $\\tau$ at the boundary has a constant value of $\\epsilon$ and $v$ associated with it, and its speed is $C(\\tau) = c(\\epsilon(0,\\tau))$. The equation for this characteristic is:\n$$\nx = C(\\tau)(t-\\tau)\n$$\nAt the boundary $x=0$, we have $v(0,\\tau) = a\\tau$. The corresponding strain is $\\epsilon(0,\\tau) \\approx v(0,\\tau)/c_0 = a\\tau/c_0$. The speed of the characteristic generated at time $\\tau$ is therefore:\n$$\nC(\\tau) \\approx c_0\\left(1 + \\frac{\\beta}{E}\\epsilon(0,\\tau)\\right) = c_0\\left(1 + \\frac{\\beta}{E}\\frac{a\\tau}{c_0}\\right) = c_0 + \\frac{\\beta a}{E}\\tau\n$$\nSince $\\beta > 0$ and $a > 0$, characteristics generated at later times ($\\tau_2 > \\tau_1$) travel faster ($C(\\tau_2) > C(\\tau_1)$). This leads to wave steepening and the eventual formation of a shock, which occurs when these characteristics intersect. The time $t_s$ at which a shock first forms is found from the intersection time of adjacent characteristics. The time until a shock forms is given by $t_s(\\tau) = \\tau + C(\\tau)/C'(\\tau)$, where $C'(\\tau) = dC/d\\tau$. From our expression for $C(\\tau)$, its derivative is constant:\n$$\nC'(\\tau) = \\frac{\\beta a}{E}\n$$\nThe first shock forms at the minimum of $t_s(\\tau)$ for $\\tau \\ge 0$. Since $C(\\tau)$ is a linear increasing function of $\\tau$, the intersection time for any pair of characteristics is constant. Let's find the intersection of the characteristic generated at $\\tau_1$ and $\\tau_2$:\n$x = C(\\tau_1)(t-\\tau_1) = C(\\tau_2)(t-\\tau_2)$.\n$t = \\frac{C(\\tau_2)\\tau_2 - C(\\tau_1)\\tau_1}{C(\\tau_2)-C(\\tau_1)}$.\nAs $\\tau_2 \\to \\tau_1=\\tau$, this becomes $t = \\frac{d(C\\tau)}{d\\tau} / \\frac{dC}{d\\tau} = \\frac{C+\\tau C'}{C'} = \\tau + \\frac{C}{C'}$.\nSo, the shock formation time associated with a characteristic starting at $\\tau$ is:\n$$\nt_s(\\tau) = \\tau + \\frac{c_0 + \\frac{\\beta a}{E}\\tau}{\\frac{\\beta a}{E}} = \\tau + \\frac{c_0 E}{\\beta a} + \\tau = 2\\tau + \\frac{c_0 E}{\\beta a}\n$$\nThe first shock forms at the minimum of $t_s(\\tau)$ for $\\tau \\ge 0$. Since $t_s(\\tau)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $\\tau$, the minimum occurs at $\\tau=0$. The time of shock formation is therefore:\n$$\nt_s = t_s(0) = \\frac{c_0 E}{\\beta a}\n$$\nThe distance from the boundary at which this shock forms, $x_s$, is the position of the characteristic generated at $\\tau=0$ at time $t_s$:\n$$\nx_s = C(0)(t_s - 0) = c_0 \\left(\\frac{c_0 E}{\\beta a}\\right) = \\frac{c_0^2 E}{\\beta a}\n$$\nSubstituting $c_0^2 = E/\\rho$:\n$$\nx_s = \\frac{(E/\\rho) E}{\\beta a} = \\frac{E^2}{\\rho \\beta a}\n$$\nThis is the required analytical expression for the shock formation distance.\n\nNow, I will evaluate this expression numerically with the given values:\n$E = 210 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\text{Pa}$\n$\\rho = 7.80 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{kg/m}^{3}$\n$\\beta = 3.00 \\times 10^{11}\\ \\text{Pa}$\n$a = 5.00 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\text{m/s}^{2}$\n\n$$\nx_s = \\frac{(210 \\times 10^9)^2}{(7.80 \\times 10^3)(3.00 \\times 10^{11})(5.00 \\times 10^6)}\n$$\n$$\nx_s = \\frac{4.41 \\times 10^{22}}{ (7.80 \\times 3.00 \\times 5.00) \\times 10^{(3+11+6)} }\n$$\n$$\nx_s = \\frac{4.41 \\times 10^{22}}{117 \\times 10^{20}} = \\frac{4.41 \\times 10^{22}}{1.17 \\times 10^{22}}\n$$\n$$\nx_s = \\frac{4.41}{1.17} \\approx 3.7692307... \\text{ m}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $3.769$ m.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.769}$$", "id": "2906753"}, {"introduction": "Efficiently guiding wave energy between two different media is a central challenge in acoustics, electronics, and mechanics, often solved using an impedance-matching transformer.

Starting from the load $Z_{\\mathrm{load}} = Z(L)$ (the semi-infinite right bar), recursively compute the input impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{in}}(0,\\omega)$ seen at $x=0^{+}$ across frequency by cascading the $N$ segments.

Design three different impedance profiles $Z(x)$ over $x \\in [0,L]$ that bridge between $Z(0)=Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}}$ and $Z(L)=Z_{\\mathrm{Rbar}}$, where $Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}}$ and $Z_{\\mathrm{Rbar}}$ are the characteristic impedances of the left and right uniform bars, respectively. Use the following shape prescriptions:\n   - Case A (linear in $Z$): $Z(x) = Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}} + \\left(Z_{\\mathrm{Rbar}} - Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}}\\right)\\, t$, where $t = x/L$.\n   - Case B (linear in $\\log Z$): $Z(x) = Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}} \\, \\left(Z_{\\mathrm{Rbar}}/Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}}\\right)^{t}$, where $t = x/L$.\n   - Case C (raised-cosine in $\\log Z$): $\\log Z(x) = \\log Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}} + s(t)\\left(\\log Z_{\\mathrm{Rbar}} - \\log Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}}\\right)$ with $s(t) = \\tfrac{1}{2} - \\tfrac{1}{2} \\cos(\\pi t)$ and $t=x/L$, and then $Z(x) = \\exp\\left(\\log Z(x)\\right)$.\n6. For each profile, solve the inverse problem $A(x) = Z(x)/\\alpha$ using your $\\alpha$ from Task 1. Then, for each specified frequency band, compute the maximum in-band reflection magnitude $\\max_{\\omega \\in [\\omega_{\\min},\\omega_{\\max}]} |\\Gamma(\\omega)|$ using the $N$-slice cascade with the input-impedance recursion from Task 4.\n\nPhysical and numerical data:\n- Use $\\rho = 7{,}850 \\ \\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}$ and $E = 210 \\times 10^{9} \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$ to compute $c$ and $\\alpha$.\n- Left bar area $A_{\\mathrm{L}} = 1.0\\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m^{2}}$, right bar area $A_{\\mathrm{R}} = 4.0\\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m^{2}}$.

It is a rigorous and self-contained exercise in wave propagation and impedance matching. A solution will be provided.\n\n---\n\nThe solution proceeds by systematically addressing the tasks outlined in the problem statement.\n\n**Task 1: Characteristic Impedance and Inverse Problem**\n\nWe begin from the fundamental relations for harmonic waves. Assuming a time-dependence of $e^{i\\omega t}$, the partial derivatives with respect to time become multiplications by $i\\omega$. The axial force $F$ and particle velocity $v$ are represented by their complex amplitudes (phasors) $\\hat{F}(x)$ and $\\hat{v}(x)$. The governing equations for a uniform bar segment of area $A$ are derived as follows:\n\nThe momentum balance is $\\partial \\sigma/\\partial x = \\rho \\partial v/\\partial t$. Multiplying by $A$ and using $F=\\sigma A$ (for uniform $A$), we have $\\partial F/\\partial x = \\rho A \\partial v/\\partial t$. In the frequency domain, this is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\hat{F}}{dx} = i\\omega \\rho A \\hat{v}\n$$\nThe constitutive relation is $\\sigma = E \\partial u/\\partial x$, so $F/A = E \\partial u/\\partial x$. The kinematic definition is $v = \\partial u/\\partial t$. Differentiating velocity with respect to position gives $\\partial v/\\partial x = \\partial(\\partial u/\\partial t)/\\partial x = \\partial(\\partial u/\\partial x)/\\partial t$. Substituting the constitutive relation, we get $\\partial v/\\partial x = \\frac{1}{E} \\frac{\\partial (F/A)}{\\partial t}$. In the frequency domain:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\hat{v}}{dx} = \\frac{i\\omega}{EA} \\hat{F}\n$$\nThese two first-order equations can be combined into a second-order wave equation. Differentiating the first equation and substituting the second gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\hat{F}}{dx^2} = i\\omega \\rho A \\frac{d\\hat{v}}{dx} = i\\omega \\rho A \\left(\\frac{i\\omega}{EA}\\right) \\hat{F} = -\\frac{\\omega^2 \\rho}{E} \\hat{F}\n$$\nWith the wave speed $c = \\sqrt{E/\\rho}$ and wavenumber $k = \\omega/c$, this is the Helmholtz equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\hat{F}}{dx^2} + k^2\\hat{F} = 0\n$$\nThe general solution for force is a superposition of forward ($+x$) and backward ($-x$) propagating waves: $\\hat{F}(x) = F^+ e^{-ikx} + F^- e^{ikx}$. The corresponding velocity is found from the momentum balance equation:\n$$\n\\hat{v}(x) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega\\rho A} \\frac{d\\hat{F}}{dx} = \\frac{1}{i\\omega\\rho A}(-ikF^+e^{-ikx} + ikF^-e^{ikx}) = \\frac{k}{\\omega\\rho A}(F^+e^{-ikx} - F^-e^{ikx})\n$$\nSubstituting $k/\\omega = 1/c$:\n$$\n\\hat{v}(x) = \\frac{1}{\\rho c A} (F^+e^{-ikx} - F^-e^{ikx})\n$$\nThe characteristic impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{c}}$ is the ratio of force to velocity for a purely forward-propagating wave ($F^-=0$):\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{F^+e^{-ikx}}{\\frac{1}{\\rho c A} F^+e^{-ikx}} = \\rho c A\n$$\nUsing $c=\\sqrt{E/\\rho}$, this can also be written as $Z_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\sqrt{E\\rho}A$.\nThis is of the form $Z_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\alpha A$ where the constant $\\alpha$ is explicitly $\\alpha = \\rho c = \\sqrt{E\\rho}$.\n\nThe inverse problem is to find the area profile $A(x)$ for a prescribed impedance profile $Z(x)$. From the derived relationship, the solution is immediate:\n$$\nA(x) = \\frac{Z(x)}{\\alpha} = \\frac{Z(x)}{\\sqrt{E\\rho}}\n$$\n\n**Task 2: Reflection Coefficient at an Abrupt Step**\n\nConsider an interface at $x=0$ between two uniform bars with characteristic impedances $Z_1$ (for $x<0$) and $Z_2$ (for $x>0$). At the interface, both force and particle velocity must be continuous. An incident wave ($F_i, v_i$) from the left gives rise to a reflected wave ($F_r, v_r$) and a transmitted wave ($F_t, v_t$).\nContinuity equations at $x=0$:\n$$\nF_i + F_r = F_t\n$$\n$$\nv_i + v_r = v_t\n$$\nThe force-velocity relations are: $v_i = F_i/Z_1$ for the incident wave, $v_r = -F_r/Z_1$ for the backward-reflected wave, and $v_t = F_t/Z_2$ for the forward-transmitted wave. Substituting these into the velocity continuity equation:\n$$\n\\frac{F_i}{Z_1} - \\frac{F_r}{Z_1} = \\frac{F_t}{Z_2}\n$$\nSubstitute $F_t$ from the force continuity equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{Z_1}(F_i - F_r) = \\frac{1}{Z_2}(F_i + F_r)\n$$\nRearranging to solve for the reflection coefficient $\\Gamma = F_r/F_i$:\n$$\nZ_2(F_i - F_r) = Z_1(F_i + F_r) \\implies F_r(Z_1+Z_2) = F_i(Z_2-Z_1)\n$$\n$$\n\\Gamma = \\frac{F_r}{F_i} = \\frac{Z_2 - Z_1}{Z_2 + Z_1}\n$$\n\n**Task 3: Input Impedance of a Terminated Segment**\n\nConsider a uniform segment of length $\\ell$ and characteristic impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{c}}$, located for instance on $x \\in [-\\ell, 0]$, terminated at $x=0$ by a load impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{L}}$. The input impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is sought at $x=-\\ell$.\nThe total force and velocity phasors within the segment are:\n$$\n\\hat{F}(x) = F^+ e^{-ikx} + F^- e^{ikx}\n\\qquad\n\\hat{v}(x) = \\frac{1}{Z_{\\mathrm{c}}}(F^+ e^{-ikx} - F^- e^{ikx})\n$$\nAt the load ($x=0$), the impedance is $Z_{\\mathrm{L}} = \\hat{F}(0)/\\hat{v}(0)$.\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{L}} = Z_{\\mathrm{c}} \\frac{F^+ + F^-}{F^+ - F^-}\n$$\nAt the input ($x=-\\ell$), the input impedance is $Z_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\hat{F}(-\\ell)/\\hat{v}(-\\ell)$.\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{in}} = Z_{\\mathrm{c}} \\frac{F^+e^{ik\\ell} + F^-e^{-ik\\ell}}{F^+e^{ik\\ell} - F^-e^{-ik\\ell}}\n$$\nFrom the load equation, we find the reflection ratio at the load, $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{L}} = F^-/F^+ = (Z_{\\mathrm{L}}-Z_{\\mathrm{c}})/(Z_{\\mathrm{L}}+Z_{\\mathrm{c}})$. Substituting this into the $Z_{\\mathrm{in}}$ expression is one path. An alternative, more direct path is to expand the terms:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{in}} = Z_{\\mathrm{c}} \\frac{(Z_{\\mathrm{L}}+Z_{\\mathrm{c}})e^{ik\\ell} + (Z_{\\mathrm{L}}-Z_{\\mathrm{c}})e^{-ik\\ell}}{(Z_{\\mathrm{L}}+Z_{\\mathrm{c}})e^{ik\\ell} - (Z_{\\mathrm{L}}-Z_{\\mathrm{c}})e^{-ik\\ell}}\n$$\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{in}} = Z_{\\mathrm{c}} \\frac{Z_{\\mathrm{L}}(e^{ik\\ell} + e^{-ik\\ell}) + Z_{\\mathrm{c}}(e^{ik\\ell} - e^{-ik\\ell})}{Z_{\\mathrm{L}}(e^{ik\\ell} - e^{-ik\\ell}) + Z_{\\mathrm{c}}(e^{ik\\ell} + e^{-ik\\ell})}\n$$\nUsing Euler's identities $2\\cos\\theta = e^{i\\theta}+e^{-i\\theta}$ and $2i\\sin\\theta = e^{i\\theta}-e^{-i\\theta}$, this simplifies to the standard transmission line input impedance formula:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{in}} = Z_{\\mathrm{c}} \\frac{Z_{\\mathrm{L}}\\cos(k\\ell) + iZ_{\\mathrm{c}}\\sin(k\\ell)}{Z_{\\mathrm{c}}\\cos(k\\ell) + iZ_{\\mathrm{L}}\\sin(k\\ell)}\n$$\nwhere $k=\\omega/c$.\n\n**Tasks 4-6: Numerical Solution for Tapered Bar**\n\nThe continuous taper of length $L$ is approximated by a cascade of $N$ uniform slices, each of length $\\Delta x = L/N$. The $j$-th slice (numbered $j=1, \\dots, N$ from left to right) has a constant characteristic impedance $Z_{c,j} = Z(x_j)$, where $x_j = (j-1/2)\\Delta x$ is the coordinate of the slice's center.\n\nThe input impedance of the entire taper, $Z_{\\mathrm{in}}(0,\\omega)$, is computed recursively. We start at the right end of the taper ($x=L$). The taper is connected to a semi-infinite bar with area $A_{\\mathrm{R}}$, which acts as a non-reflective termination. Thus, the initial load impedance is $Z_{\\mathrm{load}} = Z_{\\mathrm{Rbar}} = \\alpha A_{\\mathrm{R}}$.\n\nThe calculation proceeds from right to left. Let $Z^{(j)}$ be the input impedance at the left face of slice $j$. This impedance is the load for slice $j-1$. The input impedance for the rightmost slice $N$, which is loaded by $Z_{\\mathrm{Rbar}}$, is calculated using the formula from Task 3 with $\\ell=\\Delta x$, $Z_{\\mathrm{c}}=Z_{c,N}$, and $Z_{\\mathrm{L}}=Z_{\\mathrm{Rbar}}$. This process is repeated iteratively.\n\nLet $Z_{\\mathrm{in}}^{(N)} = Z_{\\mathrm{Rbar}}$. For $j = N, N-1, \\dots, 1$, we compute the input impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{in}}^{(j-1)}$ at the left face of slice $j$ as:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{in}}^{(j-1)} = Z_{c,j} \\frac{Z_{\\mathrm{in}}^{(j)}\\cos(k\\Delta x) + iZ_{c,j}\\sin(k\\Delta x)}{Z_{c,j}\\cos(k\\Delta x) + iZ_{\\mathrm{in}}^{(j)}\\sin(k\\Delta x)}\n$$\nAfter iterating through all slices, the final result is $Z_{\\mathrm{in}}(0,\\omega) = Z_{\\mathrm{in}}^{(0)}$.\n\nThe reflection coefficient at the input of the taper ($x=0$) is then calculated from the impedance mismatch between the left semi-infinite bar (impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}}$) and the taper's input impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{in}}(0,\\omega)$:\n$$\n\\Gamma(\\omega) = \\frac{Z_{\\mathrm{in}}(0,\\omega) - Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}}}{Z_{\\mathrm{in}}(0,\\omega) + Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}}}\n$$\nThe material properties $E = 210 \\times 10^9 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$ and $\\rho = 7850 \\ \\mathrm{kg/m^3}$ yield a wave speed $c = \\sqrt{E/\\rho} \\approx 5172.13\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$ and impedance constant $\\alpha = \\sqrt{E\\rho} \\approx 4.0592 \\times 10^7 \\ \\mathrm{kg/(s \\cdot m^2)}$. These values are used to compute $Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}} = \\alpha A_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and $Z_{\\mathrm{Rbar}} = \\alpha A_{\\mathrm{R}}$.\n\nFor each test case, the appropriate impedance profile function $Z(x)$ is defined over $x \\in [0,L]$ with $t=x/L$:\n- **Case A (Linear):** $Z(x) = Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}} + (Z_{\\mathrm{Rbar}} - Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}}) t$\n- **Case B (Exponential):** $Z(x) = Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}} (Z_{\\mathrm{Rbar}}/Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}})^{t}$\n- **Case C (Raised-Cosine):** $Z(x) = Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}} \\exp\\left( (\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(\\pi t)) \\log(Z_{\\mathrm{Rbar}}/Z_{\\mathrm{Lbar}}) \\right)$\n\nFor each case, the algorithm iterates over the specified frequency range, calculates $|\\Gamma(\\omega)|$ at each frequency point, and determines the maximum value.
