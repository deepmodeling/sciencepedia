A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires tracking the forces at the two interfaces of the specimen, $F_{\\mathrm{in}}(t)$ and $F_{\\mathrm{out}}(t)$, as a function of time. These forces are built up by a sequence of wave transmissions and reflections within the specimen.\n\nFirst, we calculate the mechanical impedances and wave propagation coefficients. The mechanical impedance is $Z = \\rho c A$. Since the diameters of the bar and specimen are equal ($d_b = d_s$), their cross-sectional areas are equal ($A_b = A_s = A$). Thus, the impedance ratio depends only on the product of density and wave speed, $\\rho c$.\nLet $Z'_b = \\rho_b c_b$ and $Z'_s = \\rho_s c_s$.\n$Z'_b = (7850\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3})(5100\\,\\mathrm{m/s}) = 4.0035 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{kg/(m^2 s)}$\n$Z'_s = (2700\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3})(5000\\,\\mathrm{m/s}) = 1.3500 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{kg/(m^2 s)}$\n\nThe reflection and transmission coefficients for stress waves are needed at both interfaces.\nAt interface 2 (specimen to transmitted bar), a wave travels from medium 's' to 'b'. The reflection coefficient is:\n$$ R_{sb} = \\frac{Z_b - Z_s}{Z_b + Z_s} = \\frac{Z'_b - Z'_s}{Z'_b + Z'_s} = \\frac{4.0035 \\times 10^7 - 1.3500 \\times 10^7}{4.0035 \\times 10^7 + 1.3500 \\times 10^7} = \\frac{2.6535}{5.3535} \\approx 0.495657 $$\nAt interface 1 (incident bar to specimen), the reflection coefficient for a wave originating in the specimen and striking the interface is also $R_{sb}$, due to the material properties being the same (bar-specimen-bar).\n\nThe transmission coefficient for a wave from the specimen into the bar is:\n$$ T_{sb} = \\frac{2Z_b}{Z_b + Z_s} = \\frac{2Z'_b}{Z'_b + Z'_s} = 1 + R_{sb} \\approx 1.495657 $$\nThe transmission coefficient for the initial incident wave from the bar into the specimen is:\n$$ T_{bs} = \\frac{2Z_s}{Z_b + Z_s} = \\frac{2Z'_s}{Z'_b + Z'_s} = 1 - R_{sb} \\approx 0.504343 $$\n\nThe analysis proceeds by tracking wave reverberations within the specimen. The characteristic time for this process is the time for a wave to traverse the specimen length $L_s$:\n$$ \\tau = \\frac{L_s}{c_s} = \\frac{5.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{5000\\,\\mathrm{m/s}} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 1.00\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s} $$\n\nLet $F_I$ be the force amplitude of the incident step wave. We can find expressions for $F_{\\mathrm{in}}(t)$ and $F_{\\mathrm{out}}(t)$ by summing the contributions of successive wave reflections.\n\nThe force at the output face, $F_{\\mathrm{out}}(t)$, is the sum of all waves transmitted from the specimen into the output bar. A wave arrives at this interface at times $t = \\tau, 3\\tau, 5\\tau, \\dots, (2N-1)\\tau$.\nFor $t \\in [(2N-1)\\tau, (2N+1)\\tau)$, the force is:\n$$ F_{\\mathrm{out}}(t) = F_I T_{bs} T_{sb} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} (R_{sb}^2)^k $$\n\nThe force at the input face, $F_{\\mathrm{in}}(t)$, is the sum of all wave amplitudes (both forward- and backward-going) within the specimen at $x=0$. These forces build up at times $t = 0, 2\\tau, 4\\tau, \\dots, 2N\\tau$.\nFor $t \\in [2N\\tau, 2(N+1)\\tau)$, the force is:\n$$ F_{\\mathrm{in}}(t) = F_I T_{bs} \\left[ \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{N} (R_{sb}^2)^k\\right) + R_{sb} \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} (R_{sb}^2)^k\\right) \\right] $$\nFor $N=0$ (i.e., $t \\in [0, 2\\tau)$), the second term is zero.\n\nLet us define the error metric $E(t) = \\frac{|F_{\\mathrm{in}}(t) - F_{\\mathrm{out}}(t)|}{(F_{\\mathrm{in}}(t) + F_{\\mathrm{out}}(t))/2}$. The incident force amplitude $F_I$ cancels out, so we can work with normalized forces $f(t) = F(t)/F_I$.\n\nWe now evaluate $E(t)$ at the beginning of each time interval, right after a wave event changes the force at one of the interfaces.\nLet $R \\equiv R_{sb} \\approx 0.495657$ and $x \\equiv R^2 \\approx 0.245676$.\nLet $S_N(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{N} x^k$.\nThen $f_{out}(t) = T_{bs} T_{sb} S_{N-1}(x)$ for $t \\in [(2N-1)\\tau, (2N+1)\\tau)$, and $f_{in}(t) = T_{bs} (S_N(x) + R S_{N-1}(x))$ for $t \\in [2N\\tau, 2(N+1)\\tau)$.\n\n- Time interval $t \\in [\\tau, 2\\tau)$: First wave reaches the output. $F_{out}$ becomes non-zero.\n  - $f_{\\mathrm{in}} = T_{bs} S_0(x) = T_{bs} \\approx 0.504343$.\n  - $f_{\\mathrm{out}} = T_{bs} T_{sb} S_0(x) = T_{bs} (1+R) \\approx 0.504343 \\times 1.495657 \\approx 0.754402$.\n  - $E(\\tau) = \\frac{2 |0.504343 - 0.754402|}{0.504343 + 0.754402} \\approx \\frac{2(0.250059)}{1.258745} \\approx 0.39729 > 0.05$.\n\n- Time interval $t \\in [2\\tau, 3\\tau)$: First reflected wave returns to the input. $F_{in}$ changes.\n  - $f_{\\mathrm{in}} = T_{bs} (S_1(x) + R S_0(x)) = T_{bs}(1+x+R) \\approx 0.504343(1 + 0.245676 + 0.495657) \\approx 0.878297$.\n  - $f_{\\mathrm{out}}$ is unchanged: $f_{\\mathrm{out}} \\approx 0.754402$.\n  - $E(2\\tau) = \\frac{2 |0.878297 - 0.754402|}{0.878297 + 0.754402} \\approx \\frac{2(0.123895)}{1.632699} \\approx 0.15177 > 0.05$.\n\n- Time interval $t \\in [3\\tau, 4\\tau)$: Second wave reaches the output. $F_{out}$ changes.\n  - $f_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is unchanged: $f_{\\mathrm{in}} \\approx 0.878297$.\n  - $f_{\\mathrm{out}} = T_{bs} T_{sb} S_1(x) = T_{bs}(1+R)(1+x) \\approx 0.754402 (1 + 0.245676) \\approx 0.939910$.\n  - $E(3\\tau) = \\frac{2 |0.878297 - 0.939910|}{0.878297 + 0.939910} \\approx \\frac{2(0.061613)}{1.818207} \\approx 0.06777 > 0.05$.\n\n- Time interval $t \\in [4\\tau, 5\\tau)$: Second reflected wave returns to the input. $F_{in}$ changes.\n  - $f_{\\mathrm{in}} = T_{bs}(S_2(x) + R S_1(x)) = T_{bs}((1+x+x^2) + R(1+x)) \\approx 0.504343( (1+0.245676+0.060356) + 0.495657(1+0.245676) ) \\approx 0.504343(1.306032 + 0.617384) \\approx 0.969976$.\n  - $f_{\\mathrm{out}}$ is unchanged: $f_{\\mathrm{out}} \\approx 0.939910$.\n  - $E(4\\tau) = \\frac{2 |0.969976 - 0.939910|}{0.969976 + 0.939910} \\approx \\frac{2(0.030066)}{1.909886} \\approx 0.03148 < 0.05$.\n\nThe equilibrium criterion is met for the first time at $t = 4\\tau$. The error continues to decrease thereafter as the forces converge to $F_I$. Thus, the earliest time for dynamic equilibrium is $t_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 4\\tau$.\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 4 \\times (1.00\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}) = 4.00\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s} $$\n\nFinally, we must verify that the semi-infinite bar assumption is valid up to this time. This requires comparing $t_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ to the time it takes for a wave to travel to the free end of each bar and return to the specimen.\n- Return time for the incident bar:\n$$ t_{ret,i} = \\frac{2L_i}{c_b} = \\frac{2 \\times 1.50\\,\\mathrm{m}}{5100\\,\\mathrm{m/s}} \\approx 5.88 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 588\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s} $$\n- Return time for the transmitted bar:\n$$ t_{ret,o} = \\frac{2L_o}{c_b} = \\frac{2 \\times 2.00\\,\\mathrm{m}}{5100\\,\\mathrm{m/s}} \\approx 7.84 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 784\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s} $$\nSince $t_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 4.00\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$ is much smaller than both $588\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$ and $784\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$, the semi-infinite bar assumption is fully justified for the duration of the equilibration process.\n\nThe problem asks for the answer in microseconds, rounded to four significant figures.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts: first, the selection of the pulse shaper material, and second, the calculation of its required thickness.\n\n**Part 1: Pulse Shaper Material Selection**\nThe selection is to be based on minimizing the impedance mismatch between the pulse shaper and the incident bar. Efficient transmission of the stress wave from the shaper into the bar is desired, which occurs when their mechanical impedances are closely matched. The longitudinal wave impedance $Z$ of a material is defined as the product of its density $\\rho$ and its longitudinal wave speed $c$, where $c = \\sqrt{E/\\rho}$.\n$$Z = \\rho c = \\rho \\sqrt{\\frac{E}{\\rho}} = \\sqrt{E \\rho}$$\nFirst, we calculate the impedance of the incident bar, which is specified to be steel.\n$$Z_{b} = \\rho_{b} c_{b} = (7850~\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}) (5180~\\mathrm{m/s}) = 40663000~\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s/m} = 40.66 \\times 10^{6}~\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s/m}$$\nNext, we calculate the impedance for each candidate pulse shaper material.\n\nFor annealed copper:\nThe wave speed is:\n$$c_{\\mathrm{ps, Cu}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{ps, Cu}}}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{ps, Cu}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{110 \\times 10^{9}~\\mathrm{Pa}}{8960~\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}}} \\approx 3503.8~\\mathrm{m/s}$$\nThe impedance is:\n$$Z_{\\mathrm{ps, Cu}} = \\rho_{\\mathrm{ps, Cu}} c_{\\mathrm{ps, Cu}} = (8960~\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}})(3503.8~\\mathrm{m/s}) \\approx 31.39 \\times 10^{6}~\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s/m}$$\n\nFor 7075-T6 aluminum:\nThe wave speed is:\n$$c_{\\mathrm{ps, Al}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{ps, Al}}}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{ps, Al}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{72 \\times 10^{9}~\\mathrm{Pa}}{2810~\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}}} \\approx 5061.9~\\mathrm{m/s}$$\nThe impedance is:\n$$Z_{\\mathrm{ps, Al}} = \\rho_{\\mathrm{ps, Al}} c_{\\mathrm{ps, Al}} = (2810~\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}})(5061.9~\\mathrm{m/s}) \\approx 14.22 \\times 10^{6}~\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s/m}$$\n\nNow, we compare the impedance mismatch, $|\\Delta Z| = |Z_{b} - Z_{\\mathrm{ps}}|$, for each material.\nFor copper:\n$$|\\Delta Z_{\\mathrm{Cu}}| = |40.66 \\times 10^{6} - 31.39 \\times 10^{6}|~\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s/m} = 9.27 \\times 10^{6}~\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s/m}$$\nFor aluminum:\n$$|\\Delta Z_{\\mathrm{Al}}| = |40.66 \\times 10^{6} - 14.22 \\times 10^{6}|~\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s/m} = 26.44 \\times 10^{6}~\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s/m}$$\nSince $|\\Delta Z_{\\mathrm{Cu}}| < |\\Delta Z_{\\mathrm{Al}}|$, the impedance mismatch is smaller for annealed copper. Therefore, annealed copper is the correct material choice to ensure more efficient wave shaping.\n\n**Part 2: Pulse Shaper Thickness Calculation**\nThe problem requires designing the pulse shaper such that the rise time of the desired strain-rate profile, $\\tau$, is achieved. A common model in pulse shaping analysis assumes that the rise time of the incident stress pulse is determined by the time it takes for the stress wave to make one round trip within the pulse shaper. The stress in the main bar builds up over this period as the wave reverberates in the shaper. The problem statement instructs us to match the rise time implied by wave transit across the pulse shaper to the target rise time $\\tau$. We adopt this standard model, where the rise time $\\tau$ is set equal to the round-trip transit time.\n$$\\tau = \\frac{2 h_{\\mathrm{ps}}}{c_{\\mathrm{ps}}}$$\nHere, $h_{\\mathrm{ps}}$ is the thickness of the pulse shaper, and $c_{\\mathrm{ps}}$ is the longitudinal wave speed in the shaper material. We have selected annealed copper, so we use its wave speed, $c_{\\mathrm{ps, Cu}} \\approx 3503.8~\\mathrm{m/s}$.

Let the bar wave speed in the one-dimensional, dispersion-free limit be $c_0$ (in $\\mathrm{m/s}$), and let the actual, frequency-dependent phase velocity be $c(\\omega)$ (in $\\mathrm{m/s}$) with $\\omega$ (in $\\mathrm{rad/s}$). Let the corresponding wavenumber be $k(\\omega) = \\omega / c(\\omega)$ (in $\\mathrm{rad/m}$), and let $k_0(\\omega) = \\omega / c_0$ (in $\\mathrm{rad/m}$) denote the non-dispersive reference. Assume linear attenuation with an angular-frequency-dependent coefficient $\\alpha(\\omega)$ (in $\\mathrm{Np/m}$). Over a propagation distance $x$ (in $\\mathrm{m}$), the frequency-domain transfer function from a source signal to a measurement is well approximated by the product of an attenuation factor and a phase factor derived from the kinematics of wave propagation.\n\nStarting only from the following fundamental base:\n- Newton’s second law and linear momentum balance in a continuum,\n- the linear, one-dimensional constitutive relation between stress and strain,\n- the definition of phase velocity $c(\\omega)$ and the dispersion relation $k(\\omega) = \\omega / c(\\omega)$,\n- the principle that propagation in a homogeneous, linear, time-invariant medium produces a frequency-domain phase accumulation proportional to distance $x$ and wavenumber, and an amplitude reduction determined by an attenuation coefficient,\n\nperform the following tasks.\n\n1) Derive the frequency-domain operator that maps a measured signal at distance $x$ back to the signal that would have been observed after non-dispersive propagation at speed $c_0$ over the same distance, explicitly identifying the phase compensation in terms of $c(\\omega)$ and $c_0$, and the amplitude compensation in terms of $\\alpha(\\omega)$ and $x$. The phase compensation must be expressed in radians.\n\n2) Implement, in a program, the following computational experiment:\n   - Synthesize a source incident strain pulse $s_0(t)$ using a Ricker wavelet centered at time $t_0$,\n     $$ s_0(t) = \\left(1 - 2\\pi^2 f_0^2 \\left(t - t_0\\right)^2\\right)\\exp\\!\\left(-\\pi^2 f_0^2 \\left(t - t_0\\right)^2\\right), $$\n     where $f_0$ (in $\\mathrm{Hz}$) is the wavelet’s central frequency. Time $t$ is in $\\mathrm{s}$.\n   - Define a physically plausible dispersion model by prescribing a phase velocity that transitions from the bar speed $c_0$ at low frequency to the bulk-like longitudinal speed $c_L$ at high frequency,\n     $$ c(\\omega) = c_0 + \\left(c_L - c_0\\right)\\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega^2 + \\omega_c^2}, $$\n     where $\\omega_c = 2\\pi f_c$ is a characteristic angular frequency (in $\\mathrm{rad/s}$), and $f_c$ is in $\\mathrm{Hz}$. This captures a smooth increase of phase velocity with frequency, consistent with longitudinal rod dispersion.\n   - Define an attenuation law\n     $$ \\alpha(\\omega) = \\beta \\,\\omega^2, $$\n     where $\\beta$ is in $\\mathrm{s^2/m}$ so that $\\alpha$ is in $\\mathrm{Np/m}$.\n   - Use the frequency-domain transfer function obtained from the fundamental base to propagate $s_0(t)$ to a measured signal at distance $x$ and then apply your derived dispersion and attenuation correction operator to reconstruct the non-dispersive-at-$c_0$ counterpart at the same distance. Use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and its inverse, and ensure proper frequency-to-wavenumber mapping. The angle unit must be radians. Use the real-valued FFT to avoid numerical asymmetry, and ensure that the final reconstructed time signal is real-valued.\n\n3) For each test case below, compute the root-mean-square (RMS) error between your reconstructed signal and the non-dispersive reference obtained by propagating the source by a distance $x$ at the constant speed $c_0$ without attenuation (i.e., a pure time delay of $x/c_0$ in the frequency domain). The RMS error is dimensionless because the signals are strains. Report each RMS error as a floating-point number.\n\nNumerical implementation requirements:\n- Use uniform sampling with sampling frequency $f_s$ (in $\\mathrm{Hz}$) over total duration $T$ (in $\\mathrm{s}$). Construct a time vector $t$ over $[0, T)$ with $N = f_s T$ samples.\n- Compute spectra with the real-valued FFT and the corresponding nonnegative angular frequencies $\\omega$.\n- Answer in specified units: all velocities in $\\mathrm{m/s}$, distances in $\\mathrm{m}$, times in $\\mathrm{s}$, frequencies in $\\mathrm{Hz}$ or $\\mathrm{rad/s}$ as indicated, and angles (phases) in radians.\n- Angle unit: radians.\n- The final output format must be a single line containing a Python list of the RMS errors for the test suite, in the order of the test cases, printed as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., \"[0.00123,0.0,0.045]\").\n\nTest suite (each line specifies $(f_s, T, c_0, c_L, f_c, \\beta, x, f_0, t_0)$ in $\\left(\\mathrm{Hz}, \\mathrm{s}, \\mathrm{m/s}, \\mathrm{m/s}, \\mathrm{Hz}, \\mathrm{s^2/m}, \\mathrm{m}, \\mathrm{Hz}, \\mathrm{s}\\right)$):\n- Case A (happy path, moderate dispersion and attenuation): $(\\;10^6,\\; 2\\times 10^{-2},\\; 5180,\\; 5900,\\; 3\\times 10^4,\\; 1\\times 10^{-12},\\; 1.2,\\; 2\\times 10^4,\\; 4\\times 10^{-3}\\;)$.\n- Case B (boundary, zero propagation distance): $(\\;10^6,\\; 2\\times 10^{-2},\\; 5180,\\; 5900,\\; 3\\times 10^4,\\; 1\\times 10^{-12},\\; 0.0,\\; 2\\times 10^4,\\; 4\\times 10^{-3}\\;)$.\n- Case C (no attenuation, stronger dispersion, longer distance): $(\\;10^6,\\; 2\\times 10^{-2},\\; 5180,\\; 5900,\\; 1\\times 10^4,\\; 0.0,\\; 2.0,\\; 1.5\\times 10^4,\\; 4\\times 10^{-3}\\;)$.\n- Case D (higher center frequency, moderate distance, stronger attenuation): $(\\;10^6,\\; 2\\times 10^{-2},\\; 5180,\\; 5900,\\; 4\\times 10^4,\\; 2\\times 10^{-12},\\; 0.8,\\; 6\\times 10^4,\\; 4\\times 10^{-3}\\;)$.\n- Case E (nearly non-dispersive, long distance): $(\\;10^6,\\; 2\\times 10^{-2},\\; 5180,\\; 5282.\\overline{0},\\; 2\\times 10^4,\\; 5\\times 10^{-13},\\; 3.0,\\; 1\\times 10^4,\\; 4\\times 10^{-3}\\;)$, where $5282.\\overline{0}$ denotes $1.02\\times 5180$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the order [Case A, Case B, Case C, Case D, Case E].", "solution": "The problem statement has been subjected to rigorous validation and is deemed to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. It presents a standard, albeit idealized, problem in the field of wave mechanics relevant to experimental techniques in materials science. The provided models for dispersion and attenuation are physically plausible simplifications, and the numerical parameters are realistic. A minor notational ambiguity in test case E is clarified by its accompanying definition and does not constitute a flaw. Therefore, I will proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to reverse the effects of dispersion and attenuation on a propagated wave pulse. This is a common task in the analysis of data from experiments such as the Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB). The solution requires deriving a correction operator in the frequency domain.\n\nLet the propagation of a one-dimensional longitudinal wave in a uniform bar be described in the frequency domain. A single harmonic component of the strain signal at angular frequency $\\omega$ and position $x=0$ can be written as $S(\\omega, 0)$. After propagating a distance $x$ through a linear, time-invariant medium, this component becomes $S(\\omega, x)$. The relationship is given by a transfer function $H(\\omega, x)$:\n$$ S(\\omega, x) = S(\\omega, 0) \\cdot H(\\omega, x) $$\nThe fundamental principles dictate that this transfer function comprises two parts: a phase shift due to propagation delay and an amplitude reduction due to material damping. For a wave propagating in the positive $x$ direction, the phase factor is $e^{-i k(\\omega) x}$, where $k(\\omega)$ is the wavenumber. The attenuation factor is $e^{-\\alpha(\\omega) x}$, where $\\alpha(\\omega)$ is the attenuation coefficient in Nepers per meter.\n\nThe physically measured signal, $s_m(t)$, is the signal at position $x$. Its Fourier transform, $S_m(\\omega)$, is thus related to the source signal's Fourier transform, $S_0(\\omega)$, by the physical propagation transfer function, $H_{phys}(\\omega, x)$:\n$$ S_m(\\omega) = S_0(\\omega) \\cdot H_{phys}(\\omega, x) $$\nwhere\n$$ H_{phys}(\\omega, x) = e^{-\\alpha(\\omega) x} \\cdot e^{-i k(\\omega) x} $$\nThe wavenumber $k(\\omega)$ is given by the dispersion relation $k(\\omega) = \\omega / c(\\omega)$, where $c(\\omega)$ is the specified frequency-dependent phase velocity.\n\nThe objective is to reconstruct the signal as it would have appeared if it had propagated through an ideal, non-dispersive medium with a constant velocity $c_0$ and zero attenuation. Let us call this the ideal reference signal, $s_{ref}(t)$. Its Fourier transform, $S_{ref}(\\omega)$, is obtained by propagating the source signal $S_0(\\omega)$ using the reference transfer function, $H_{ref}(\\omega, x)$. For this ideal case, the attenuation coefficient is zero, and the wavenumber is $k_0(\\omega) = \\omega/c_0$.\n$$ H_{ref}(\\omega, x) = e^{-i k_0(\\omega) x} $$\nThus, the spectrum of the ideal reference signal is:\n$$ S_{ref}(\\omega) = S_0(\\omega) \\cdot H_{ref}(\\omega, x) = S_0(\\omega) \\cdot e^{-i k_0(\\omega) x} $$\nWe seek a frequency-domain correction operator, $O(\\omega, x)$, that maps the measured signal spectrum, $S_m(\\omega)$, to the spectrum of the reconstructed signal, $S_{rec}(\\omega)$, such that the reconstructed signal is identical to the ideal reference signal, i.e., $S_{rec}(\\omega) = S_{ref}(\\omega)$.\n$$ S_{rec}(\\omega) = O(\\omega, x) \\cdot S_m(\\omega) $$\nTo find $O(\\omega, x)$, we set $S_{rec}(\\omega) = S_{ref}(\\omega)$:\n$$ S_{ref}(\\omega) = O(\\omega, x) \\cdot S_m(\\omega) $$\n$$ S_0(\\omega) \\cdot H_{ref}(\\omega, x) = O(\\omega, x) \\cdot \\left[ S_0(\\omega) \\cdot H_{phys}(\\omega, x) \\right] $$\nAssuming a non-trivial source signal where $S_0(\\omega)$ is not identically zero, we can solve for the operator $O(\\omega, x)$:\n$$ O(\\omega, x) = \\frac{H_{ref}(\\omega, x)}{H_{phys}(\\omega, x)} = \\frac{e^{-i k_0(\\omega) x}}{e^{-\\alpha(\\omega) x} \\cdot e^{-i k(\\omega) x}} $$\nSimplifying this expression yields the desired correction operator:\n$$ O(\\omega, x) = e^{\\alpha(\\omega) x} \\cdot e^{i (k(\\omega) - k_0(\\omega)) x} $$\nThis operator consists of two distinct components:\n1.  **Amplitude Compensation**: The term $e^{\\alpha(\\omega) x}$ precisely counteracts the amplitude decay caused by attenuation.\n2.  **Phase Compensation**: The term $e^{i (k(\\omega) - k_0(\\omega)) x}$ corrects the phase distortion caused by dispersion. The phase correction, in radians, is the argument of this complex exponential:\n    $$ \\Delta\\phi(\\omega, x) = \\left( k(\\omega) - k_0(\\omega) \\right) x = \\left( \\frac{\\omega}{c(\\omega)} - \\frac{\\omega}{c_0} \\right) x = \\omega x \\left( \\frac{1}{c(\\omega)} - \\frac{1}{c_0} \\right) $$\nThis completes the derivation of the required operator.\n\nFor the computational implementation, the continuous-time signals and their Fourier transforms are replaced by their discrete counterparts. Time is sampled at a frequency $f_s$ over a duration $T$, creating a discrete time vector. The computation of spectra is performed using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), specifically the real-valued FFT (RFFT) as the signals are real. The angular frequency $\\omega$ becomes a discrete vector corresponding to the FFT frequency bins.\n\nThe overall algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Generate the discrete source signal $s_0(t)$ and compute its spectrum $S_0(\\omega)$ using RFFT.\n2.  Simulate the \"measurement\" process: Compute the physical propagation transfer function $H_{phys}(\\omega, x)$ using the given models for $c(\\omega)$ and $\\alpha(\\omega)$, and multiply it with $S_0(\\omega)$ to obtain the measured spectrum $S_m(\\omega)$.\n3.  Apply the correction: Compute the derived operator $O(\\omega, x)$ and multiply it with $S_m(\\omega)$ to obtain the reconstructed spectrum $S_{rec}(\\omega)$.\n4.  Generate the reference: Compute the ideal reference transfer function $H_{ref}(\\omega, x)$ and multiply it with $S_0(\\omega)$ to get the reference spectrum $S_{ref}(\\omega)$.\n5.  Convert the reconstructed and reference spectra, $S_{rec}(\\omega)$ and $S_{ref}(\\omega)$, back to the time domain using the inverse RFFT to obtain $s_{rec}(t)$ and $s_{ref}(t)$.\n6.  Calculate the root-mean-square (RMS) error between $s_{rec}(t)$ and $s_{ref}(t)$.\n\nAnalytically, the reconstructed spectrum is:\n$$ S_{rec}(\\omega) = O(\\omega, x)S_m(\\omega) = \\left( \\frac{H_{ref}(\\omega, x)}{H_{phys}(\\omega, x)} \\right) \\left( S_0(\\omega)H_{phys}(\\omega, x) \\right) = S_0(\\omega)H_{ref}(\\omega, x) = S_{ref}(\\omega) $$\nThis shows that, within this idealized framework, the reconstruction is mathematically perfect. Consequently, the time-domain signals $s_{rec}(t)$ and $s_{ref}(t)$ must be identical. The computed RMS error should therefore be zero, or a very small value attributable to floating-point arithmetic precision limits. A non-negligible error would indicate a flaw in the implementation of the derived principles.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.fft import rfft, irfft, rfftfreq\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the wave dispersion correction problem for a suite of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # (fs, T, c0, cL, fc, beta, x, f0, t0) in (Hz, s, m/s, m/s, Hz, s^2/m, m, Hz, s)\n        # Case A: Happy path, moderate dispersion and attenuation\n        (1e6, 2e-2, 5180, 5900, 3e4, 1e-12, 1.2, 2e4, 4e-3),\n        # Case B: Boundary, zero propagation distance\n        (1e6, 2e-2, 5180, 5900, 3e4, 1e-12, 0.0, 2e4, 4e-3),\n        # Case C: No attenuation, stronger dispersion, longer distance\n        (1e6, 2e-2, 5180, 5900, 1e4, 0.0, 2.0, 1.5e4, 4e-3),\n        # Case D: Higher center frequency, moderate distance, stronger attenuation\n        (1e6, 2e-2, 5180, 5900, 4e4, 2e-12, 0.8, 6e4, 4e-3),\n        # Case E: Nearly non-dispersive, long distance. cL is 1.02 * c0.\n        (1e6, 2e-2, 5180, 5180 * 1.02, 2e4, 5e-13, 3.0, 1e4, 4e-3)\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for params in test_cases:\n        fs, T, c0, cL, fc, beta, x, f0, t0 = params\n\n        # 1.
