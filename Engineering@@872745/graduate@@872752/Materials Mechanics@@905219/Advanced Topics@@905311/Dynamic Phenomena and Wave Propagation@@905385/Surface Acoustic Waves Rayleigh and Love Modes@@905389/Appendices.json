With $\\mathbf{u}(x,z,t) = \\Re\\{\\mathbf{U}(z)\\exp[i(kx-\\omega t)]\\}$, the velocity at the surface $z=0$ is $\\dot{\\mathbf{u}}(x,0,t) = \\Re\\{-i\\omega\\mathbf{U}(0)\\exp[i(kx-\\omega t)]\\}$. The kinetic energy per unit area of the mass layer is $\\frac{1}{2}m|\\dot{\\mathbf{u}}(x,0,t)|^2$. The time-average of $|\\dot{\\mathbf{u}}|^2$ over one period is $\\frac{1}{2}\\omega^2|\\mathbf{U}|^2$.\nTherefore, the time-averaged added kinetic energy is:\n$$\n\\langle \\Delta W_k \\rangle = \\frac{1}{4} m \\omega^2 |\\mathbf{U}(0)|^2 = \\frac{1}{4} m \\omega^2 \\left( |U_x(0)|^2 + |U_z(0)|^2 \\right)\n$$\nSecond, we calculate the total time-averaged kinetic energy of the unperturbed Rayleigh wave, $\\langle W_k \\rangle_{total}$, integrated over the depth of the half-space. The time-averaged kinetic energy density at a depth $z$ is $\\langle w_k(z) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{4}\\rho\\omega^2|\\mathbf{U}(z)|^2$. Integrating this from $z=0$ to $z=\\infty$ gives:\n$$\n\\langle W_k \\rangle_{total} = \\int_0^\\infty \\langle w_k(z) \\rangle \\,dz = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{4}\\rho\\omega^2 |\\mathbf{U}(z)|^2 \\,dz\n$$\n$$\n\\langle W_k \\rangle_{total} = \\frac{1}{4} \\rho \\omega^2 \\int_0^\\infty \\left( |U_x(z)|^2 + |U_z(z)|^2 \\right) \\,dz\n$$\nNow, we substitute these energy expressions into the perturbation formula:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta c_R}{c_R} \\approx - \\frac{\\frac{1}{4} m \\omega^2 \\left( |U_x(0)|^2 + |U_z(0)|^2 \\right)}{2 \\left[ \\frac{1}{4} \\rho \\omega^2 \\int_0^\\infty \\left( |U_x(z)|^2 + |U_z(z)|^2 \\right) \\,dz \\right]}\n$$\nThe terms $\\frac{1}{4}\\omega^2$ cancel, yielding:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta c_R}{c_R} = - \\frac{m \\left( |U_x(0)|^2 + |U_z(0)|^2 \\right)}{2 \\rho \\int_0^\\infty \\left( |U_x(z)|^2 + |U_z(z)|^2 \\right) \\,dz}\n$$\nThe final step is to express this result in terms of the given dimensionless parameters $\\gamma$ and $\\Lambda$.\nThe definitions are:\n$$\n\\gamma \\equiv \\frac{|U_z(0)|^2}{|U_x(0)|^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\Lambda \\equiv \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{|U_x(z)|^2}{|U_x(0)|^2}+\\frac{|U_z(z)|^2}{|U_x(0)|^2}\\right)\\,dz\n$$\nTo utilize these definitions, we factor out $|U_x(0)|^2$ from our expression.\nThe numerator becomes:\n$$\nm \\left( |U_x(0)|^2 + |U_z(0)|^2 \\right) = m |U_x(0)|^2 \\left( 1 + \\frac{|U_z(0)|^2}{|U_x(0)|^2} \\right) = m |U_x(0)|^2 (1+\\gamma)\n$$\nThe denominator's integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty \\left( |U_x(z)|^2 + |U_z(z)|^2 \\right) \\,dz = |U_x(0)|^2 \\int_0^\\infty \\left( \\frac{|U_x(z)|^2}{|U_x(0)|^2} + \\frac{|U_z(z)|^2}{|U_x(0)|^2} \\right) \\,dz = |U_x(0)|^2 \\Lambda\n$$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $\\Delta c_R / c_R$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta c_R}{c_R} = - \\frac{m |U_x(0)|^2 (1+\\gamma)}{2 \\rho |U_x(0)|^2 \\Lambda}\n$$\nThe term $|U_x(0)|^2$ cancels, as it must, for the result to be independent of the wave amplitude.
