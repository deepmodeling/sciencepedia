It represents a standard exercise in continuum damage mechanics. We shall proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nFirst, we must derive the constitutive relation for the Cauchy stress, $\\sigma$, from the given Helmholtz free energy per unit volume, $\\psi$. The stress is defined by the thermodynamic relation $\\sigma = \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\epsilon}$. The free energy is given as:\n$$\n\\psi(\\epsilon,d) = \\frac{1}{2} E \\left[(1-d)\\langle \\epsilon \\rangle_{+}^{2} + \\langle \\epsilon \\rangle_{-}^{2}\\right]\n$$\nwhere $\\langle \\epsilon \\rangle_{+} = \\max(\\epsilon,0)$ and $\\langle \\epsilon \\rangle_{-} = \\min(\\epsilon,0)$. To compute the derivative, we must consider two cases based on the sign of the strain $\\epsilon$.\n\nCase 1: Tension ($\\epsilon > 0$).\nIn this case, $\\langle \\epsilon \\rangle_{+} = \\epsilon$ and $\\langle \\epsilon \\rangle_{-} = 0$. The free energy expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\psi(\\epsilon > 0, d) = \\frac{1}{2} E (1-d) \\epsilon^2\n$$\nThe stress is then:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\epsilon} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} E (1-d) \\epsilon^2 \\right) = E(1-d)\\epsilon\n$$\nThe effective Young's modulus in tension is $E_{\\text{eff}} = E(1-d)$, which degrades as damage $d$ accumulates.\n\nCase 2: Compression ($\\epsilon < 0$).\nIn this case, $\\langle \\epsilon \\rangle_{+} = 0$ and $\\langle \\epsilon \\rangle_{-} = \\epsilon$. The free energy expression becomes:\n$$\n\\psi(\\epsilon < 0, d) = \\frac{1}{2} E \\epsilon^2\n$$\nThe stress is then:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\epsilon} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} E \\epsilon^2 \\right) = E\\epsilon\n$$\nIn compression, the response is linear elastic with the initial, undamaged Young's modulus $E$, irrespective of the value of the damage variable $d$. This is the meaning of a unilateral damage effect.\n\nFor completeness, at $\\epsilon=0$, both expressions yield $\\sigma=0$, ensuring continuity. Combining these results gives the piecewise stress-strain relation:\n$$\n\\sigma(\\epsilon) =\n\\begin{cases}\nE(1-d)\\epsilon, & \\epsilon \\ge 0 \\\\\nE\\epsilon, & \\epsilon < 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis is the uniaxial stress-strain relation required by the first task. The damage variable $d$ is a function of the history variable $\\kappa(t) = \\max_{\\tau \\in [0,t]} \\langle \\epsilon(\\tau) \\rangle_{+}$.\n\nNext, we analyze the prescribed three-stage loading path, tracking the state variables $(\\epsilon, \\sigma, \\kappa, d)$. The initial state is $\\epsilon(0)=0$, $\\sigma(0)=0$, and from the problem statement, $d(0)=0$. This implies $\\kappa(0) = \\langle\\epsilon(0)\\rangle_+ = 0$.\n\nStage A (Monotonic Compression): The strain is driven from $\\epsilon=0$ to $\\epsilon_A = -0.002$.\nThroughout this stage, the strain $\\epsilon(\\tau)$ is non-positive. Therefore, the tensile part of the strain is always zero: $\\langle \\epsilon(\\tau) \\rangle_{+} = 0$.\nThe history variable remains at its initial value:\n$$\n\\kappa(\\tau) = \\max_{s \\in [0, \\tau]} \\langle \\epsilon(s) \\rangle_{+} = 0\n$$\nSince $\\kappa = 0 \\le \\kappa_0 = 0.001$, the damage variable does not evolve and remains at its initial value, $d(\\kappa)=d(0)=0$.\nThe stress-strain response follows the compressive branch: $\\sigma(\\epsilon) = E\\epsilon$.\nAt the end of Stage A, we have $\\epsilon_A = -0.002$, $\\kappa_A = 0$, and $d_A=0$.\n\nStage B (Unloading to Zero Stress): The strain is driven from $\\epsilon_A = -0.002$ until $\\sigma=0$.\nSince the response in the compressive regime is linear elastic, unloading follows the same path as loading. The stress becomes zero when the strain returns to zero. The path is $\\sigma=E\\epsilon$ for $\\epsilon \\in [-0.002, 0]$. This is the unloading path in Stage B.\nDuring this stage, the strain remains non-positive, so $\\kappa$ and $d$ do not change.\nAt the end of Stage B, the state is: $\\epsilon_B=0$, $\\sigma_B=0$, $\\kappa_B=0$, and $d_B=0$.\n\nStage C (Monotonic Tension): The strain is driven from $\\epsilon=0$ to $\\epsilon_C = 0.0018$.\nThe material is now subjected to tensile strain, $\\epsilon \\ge 0$. The stress-strain relation is $\\sigma(\\epsilon) = E(1-d)\\epsilon$.\nBecause the loading is monotonic from $\\epsilon=0$, the history variable is equal to the current strain: $\\kappa(\\epsilon) = \\epsilon$.

The response is linear elastic. The initial reloading stiffness in Stage C is therefore the undamaged Young's modulus, $E$. This completes the first task.\n\n- For $\\epsilon > \\kappa_0$:\nDamage initiates and evolves according to the specified law:\n$$\nd(\\epsilon) = 1 - \\frac{\\kappa_{0}}{\\epsilon}\\,\\exp(-B(\\epsilon - \\kappa_{0}))\n$$\nSubstituting this into the tensile stress-strain relation:\n$$\n\\sigma(\\epsilon) = E\\left(1 - \\left[1 - \\frac{\\kappa_{0}}{\\epsilon}\\,\\exp(-B(\\epsilon - \\kappa_{0}))\\right]\\right)\\epsilon\n$$\nThis simplifies to the post-peak softening response:\n$$\n\\sigma(\\epsilon) = E\\kappa_0\\exp(-B(\\epsilon - \\kappa_0))\n$$\n\nNow, we perform the second task: compute the stress at the end of Stage C, $\\sigma(\\epsilon_C)$, where $\\epsilon_C = 0.0018$.\nThe material parameters are given as $E = 70\\,\\text{GPa} = 70 \\times 10^9\\,\\text{Pa}$, $\\kappa_0 = 0.001$, and $B=100$.\nSince $\\epsilon_C = 0.0018 > \\kappa_0 = 0.001$, we must use the softening stress relation.\n$$\n\\sigma(\\epsilon_C) = E \\kappa_0 \\exp(-B(\\epsilon_C - \\kappa_0))\n$$\nSubstitute the numerical values:\n$$\n\\sigma(0.0018) = (70 \\times 10^9\\,\\text{Pa}) \\times (0.001) \\times \\exp(-100 \\times (0.0018 - 0.001))\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma(0.0018) = (70 \\times 10^6\\,\\text{Pa}) \\times \\exp(-100 \\times 0.0008)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma(0.0018) = 70 \\times 10^6 \\times \\exp(-0.08)\\,\\text{Pa}\n$$\nThe stress is required in MPa, where $1\\,\\text{MPa} = 10^6\\,\\text{Pa}$.\n$$\n\\sigma(0.0018) = 70 \\times \\exp(-0.08)\\,\\text{MPa}\n$$\nCalculating the value:\n$$\n\\exp(-0.08) \\approx 0.923116\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma(0.0018) \\approx 70 \\times 0.923116\\,\\text{MPa} \\approx 64.6181\\,\\text{MPa}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, we obtain $\\sigma(\\epsilon_C) \\approx 64.6\\,\\text{MPa}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{64.6}\n$$", "id": "2895542"}, {"introduction": "While uniaxial models are instructive, real-world components experience complex, multiaxial states of stress and strain.

The strain in this direction is $\\varepsilon_{11} = e$. The lateral faces are traction-free, which implies a uniaxial stress state: $\\sigma_{11} \\neq 0$ and all other stress components are zero ($\\sigma_{22} = \\sigma_{33} = \\sigma_{ij}|_{i \\neq j} = 0$).\nFrom Hooke's law in terms of $E$ and $\\nu$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{11} = \\frac{1}{E} \\sigma_{11} \\implies e = \\frac{\\sigma_{11}}{E} \\implies \\sigma_{11} = Ee $$\nThe lateral strains are:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{22} = -\\frac{\\nu}{E} \\sigma_{11} = -\\nu e $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{33} = -\\frac{\\nu}{E} \\sigma_{11} = -\\nu e $$\nAll shear strains are zero. The strain tensor is:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\text{ut}} = \\begin{pmatrix} e & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\nu e & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\nu e \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow we compute $\\kappa_{1}$ for this state (denoted $\\kappa_{1, \\text{ut}}$):\n$$ \\kappa_{1, \\text{ut}} = \\|\\varepsilon_{\\text{ut}}\\| = \\sqrt{\\varepsilon_{ij}\\varepsilon_{ij}} = \\sqrt{\\varepsilon_{11}^2 + \\varepsilon_{22}^2 + \\varepsilon_{33}^2} = \\sqrt{e^2 + (-\\nu e)^2 + (-\\nu e)^2} = \\sqrt{e^2(1 + 2\\nu^2)} $$\nSince $e>0$, we have $\\kappa_{1, \\text{ut}} = e\\sqrt{1 + 2\\nu^2}$.\n\nNext, we compute the strain energy density $W_{\\text{ut}}$:\n$$ W_{\\text{ut}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_{ij}\\varepsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma_{11}\\varepsilon_{11} = \\frac{1}{2}(Ee)(e) = \\frac{1}{2}Ee^2 $$\nNow we compute $\\kappa_{2, \\text{ut}}$:\n$$ \\kappa_{2, \\text{ut}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2W_{\\text{ut}}}{E}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(\\frac{1}{2}Ee^2)}{E}} = \\sqrt{e^2} = e $$\n\n**Step 2: Calibration of Equivalent Strains**\nThe problem defines the equivalent strains $\\tilde{\\varepsilon}^{(i)}$ by the condition that $\\tilde{\\varepsilon}^{(i)} = e$ in the uniaxial tension state described above. We assume a simple proportional relationship, $\\tilde{\\varepsilon}^{(i)} = C_i \\kappa_i$, where $C_i$ are calibration constants.\n\nFor $i=1$:\n$$ \\tilde{\\varepsilon}^{(1)}_{\\text{ut}} = C_1 \\kappa_{1, \\text{ut}} \\implies e = C_1 (e\\sqrt{1 + 2\\nu^2}) \\implies C_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + 2\\nu^2}} $$\nThus, the first equivalent strain is defined as $\\tilde{\\varepsilon}^{(1)} = \\frac{\\kappa_1}{\\sqrt{1+2\\nu^2}} = \\frac{\\|\\varepsilon\\|}{\\sqrt{1+2\\nu^2}}$.\n\nFor $i=2$:\n$$ \\tilde{\\varepsilon}^{(2)}_{\\text{ut}} = C_2 \\kappa_{2, \\text{ut}} \\implies e = C_2 e \\implies C_2 = 1 $$\nThus, the second equivalent strain is defined as $\\tilde{\\varepsilon}^{(2)} = \\kappa_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2W}{E}}$.\n\n**Step 3: Pure Shear Analysis**\nConsider a state of pure shear with engineering shear strain $\\gamma$.

It is based on standard principles of continuum damage mechanics and presents a clear, solvable task with sufficient information. There are no contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nPart 1: Analysis of Degrading the Bulk Modulus $K$\n\nIn linear elasticity, the bulk modulus $K$ relates the hydrostatic pressure $p$ to the volumetric strain $\\operatorname{tr}(\\varepsilon)$, via the relation $p = -K \\operatorname{tr}(\\varepsilon)$. A nearly incompressible material is characterized by a very large bulk modulus, $K \\gg G$, implying that a very large pressure is required to induce even a small change in volume. In the ideal limit of incompressibility, $K \\to \\infty$, which enforces the kinematic constraint $\\operatorname{tr}(\\varepsilon) = 0$.\n\nIn displacement-based Finite Element Method (FEM) formulations, this incompressibility constraint is often applied weakly. Standard low-order elements cannot accurately represent the isochoric (volume-preserving) deformation fields required by the constraint. This leads to a numerical artifact known as \"volumetric locking,\" where the element exhibits an overly stiff, non-physical response because the large $K$ term dominates the element stiffness matrix, effectively preventing any deformation.\n\nModel A proposes an energy function where both $K$ and $G$ are degraded by the factor $(1-d)$. The effective bulk modulus becomes $\\tilde{K} = (1-d)K$. For a nearly incompressible material ($K$ large), as damage $d$ accumulates and approaches $1$, the effective bulk modulus $\\tilde{K}$ collapses towards zero. This is physically questionable for many materials, such as metals, where damage mechanisms like micro-voiding affect shear strength far more significantly than bulk compressibility. A damaged material does not necessarily become easy to compress; in fact, under compressive loading, micro-void closure can lead to a stiffening response. Thus, degrading $K$ introduces an unphysical volumetric compliance.\n\nNumerically, this behavior is problematic. A material point can transition from a state of near-incompressibility ($d \\approx 0$, large $K$) to a state of extreme compressibility ($d \\to 1$, small $\\tilde{K}$). This drastic change in the nature of the constitutive response can lead to severe numerical instabilities and convergence failures in FEM simulations. Volumetric locking may appear in undamaged zones, while adjacent, fully damaged zones exhibit spurious, non-physical volumetric strains, contaminating the solution.\n\nModel B avoids this pathology by assuming that damage only affects the deviatoric (shear) response, preserving the bulk modulus $K$. This is a common and physically more plausible assumption. It maintains the material's resistance to volumetric change regardless of the damage state, leading to a more stable and realistic numerical model, although it does not in itself resolve the fundamental issue of volumetric locking in nearly incompressible analysis.\n\nPart 2: Derivation for Model B\n\nThe Cauchy stress tensor $\\sigma$ is derived from the Helmholtz free energy density $\\psi$ as its work-conjugate with respect to the strain tensor $\\varepsilon$:\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{\\partial \\psi_B}{\\partial \\varepsilon} $$\nThe expression for $\\psi_B$ is:\n$$ \\psi_{B}(\\varepsilon,d) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,K\\,\\big(\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon\\big)^{2} + (1-d)\\,G\\,\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{dev}}:\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{dev}} $$\nWe compute the derivative of each term with respect to $\\varepsilon$.\nFor the first term, using the chain rule and the identity $\\frac{\\partial \\operatorname{tr}(\\varepsilon)}{\\partial \\varepsilon} = \\mathbf{I}$ (where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor):\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\varepsilon}\\left( \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,K\\,\\big(\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon\\big)^{2} \\right) = \\tfrac{1}{2}K \\cdot 2\\operatorname{tr}(\\varepsilon) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\operatorname{tr}(\\varepsilon)}{\\partial \\varepsilon} = K\\operatorname{tr}(\\varepsilon)\\mathbf{I} $$\nFor the second term, we use $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{dev}} = \\varepsilon - \\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\varepsilon)\\mathbf{I}$. The standard tensor derivative is $\\frac{\\partial (\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{dev}}:\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{dev}})}{\\partial \\varepsilon} = 2\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{dev}}$. Therefore:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\varepsilon}\\left( (1-d)\\,G\\,\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{dev}}:\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{dev}} \\right) = (1-d)G \\cdot 2\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{dev}} = 2(1-d)G\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{dev}} $$\nCombining these results gives the stress-strain relation for Model B:\n$$ \\sigma = K\\operatorname{tr}(\\varepsilon)\\mathbf{I} + 2(1-d)G\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{dev}} $$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{dev}}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{ij} = K\\operatorname{tr}(\\varepsilon)\\delta_{ij} + 2(1-d)G\\left(\\varepsilon_{ij} - \\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\varepsilon)\\delta_{ij}\\right) $$\nNow, consider the uniaxial stress boundary value problem. The prescribed axial strain is $\\varepsilon_{11} = \\varepsilon_0$. Due to axisymmetry, the lateral strains are equal, $\\varepsilon_{22} = \\varepsilon_{33} = \\varepsilon_L$. The strain tensor is diagonal. The trace of the strain is $\\operatorname{tr}(\\varepsilon) = \\varepsilon_{11} + \\varepsilon_{22} + \\varepsilon_{33} = \\varepsilon_0 + 2\\varepsilon_L$.\n\nThe diagonal components of the stress tensor are:\n$$ \\sigma_{11} = K(\\varepsilon_0 + 2\\varepsilon_L) + 2(1-d)G\\left(\\varepsilon_0 - \\frac{1}{3}(\\varepsilon_0 + 2\\varepsilon_L)\\right) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{22} = K(\\varepsilon_0 + 2\\varepsilon_L) + 2(1-d)G\\left(\\varepsilon_L - \\frac{1}{3}(\\varepsilon_0 + 2\\varepsilon_L)\\right) $$\nThe boundary condition $\\sigma_{22}=0$ is used to find $\\varepsilon_L$:\n$$ 0 = K(\\varepsilon_0 + 2\\varepsilon_L) + 2(1-d)G\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\varepsilon_L - \\frac{1}{3}\\varepsilon_0\\right) $$\n$$ 0 = K(\\varepsilon_0 + 2\\varepsilon_L) + \\frac{2(1-d)G}{3}(\\varepsilon_L - \\varepsilon_0) $$\nCollecting terms for $\\varepsilon_L$ and $\\varepsilon_0$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_L \\left(2K + \\frac{2(1-d)G}{3} \\right) = \\varepsilon_0 \\left(\\frac{2(1-d)G}{3} - K \\right) $$\nMultiplying by $3$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_L \\left(6K + 2(1-d)G \\right) = \\varepsilon_0 \\left(2(1-d)G - 3K \\right) $$\nSolving for $\\varepsilon_L$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_L = \\varepsilon_0 \\frac{2(1-d)G - 3K}{6K + 2(1-d)G} = -\\varepsilon_0 \\frac{3K - 2(1-d)G}{2(3K + (1-d)G)} $$\nTo find $\\sigma_{11}$, a simpler method than direct substitution is to relate $\\sigma_{11}$ and $\\sigma_{22}$.\n$$ \\sigma_{11} = K(\\varepsilon_0 + 2\\varepsilon_L) + 2(1-d)G\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\varepsilon_0 - \\frac{2}{3}\\varepsilon_L\\right) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{22} = K(\\varepsilon_0 + 2\\varepsilon_L) + 2(1-d)G\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\varepsilon_0 + \\frac{1}{3}\\varepsilon_L\\right) $$\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n$$ \\sigma_{11} - \\sigma_{22} = 2(1-d)G\\left[\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\varepsilon_0 - \\frac{2}{3}\\varepsilon_L\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\varepsilon_0 + \\frac{1}{3}\\varepsilon_L\\right)\\right] $$\nSince $\\sigma_{22}=0$:\n$$ \\sigma_{11} = 2(1-d)G \\left( \\varepsilon_0 - \\varepsilon_L \\right) $$\nNow we compute the term $(\\varepsilon_0 - \\varepsilon_L)$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_0 - \\varepsilon_L = \\varepsilon_0 - \\left(-\\varepsilon_0 \\frac{3K - 2(1-d)G}{6K + 2(1-d)G}\\right) = \\varepsilon_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{3K - 2(1-d)G}{6K + 2(1-d)G}\\right) $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_0 - \\varepsilon_L = \\varepsilon_0 \\left(\\frac{6K + 2(1-d)G + 3K - 2(1-d)G}{6K + 2(1-d)G}\\right) = \\varepsilon_0 \\frac{9K}{6K + 2(1-d)G} = \\varepsilon_0 \\frac{9K}{2(3K + (1-d)G)} $$\nFinally, substitute this into the expression for $\\sigma_{11}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{11} = 2(1-d)G \\left( \\varepsilon_0 \\frac{9K}{2(3K + (1-d)G)} \\right) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{11} = \\frac{9K(1-d)G}{3K + (1-d)G} \\varepsilon_0 $$\nThis is a closed-form expression for the axial stress $\\sigma_{11}$ in terms of the material parameters $K$, $G$, the damage variable $d$, and the prescribed strain $\\varepsilon_0$.
