The definition of damage as a reduction in effective area and the concept of effective stress are standard and scientifically sound principles in materials science and solid mechanics.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed.

All necessary information and definitions required to derive the expression for effective stress are provided.\n5.  **Relevance**: The problem is directly relevant to the topic of the principle of strain equivalence in damage modeling.\n\nThe verdict is that the problem is valid. A solution will now be formulated.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by applying the fundamental definitions of stress within the framework of continuum mechanics, as modified by the concept of damage.\n\nStep 1: The nominal Cauchy stress, denoted by $\\sigma$, is defined as the applied force per unit of initial, undeformed cross-sectional area. In this case, the externally applied force is $F$ and the initial (or nominal) area of the cross-section is $A$. Therefore, the nominal stress is given by the relation:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{F}{A}\n$$\nThis stress represents the average force distribution over the entire geometric area, without regard for internal microstructural defects.\n\nStep 2: The concept of effective stress, denoted by $\\tilde{\\sigma}$, arises from the physical reality that the internal load is not carried by the entire cross-section but only by the portion that remains undamaged. The problem states that the damage variable $D$ is a measure of the reduction of the load-carrying micro-area. The fraction of the area that is damaged is $D$, and therefore the fraction of the area that is undamaged and capable of transmitting load is $(1-D)$.\n\nThe effective area, $A_{eff}$, that actually sustains the load $F$ is thus given by:\n$$\nA_{eff} = (1-D)A\n$$\nThe effective stress, $\\tilde{\\sigma}$, is defined as the force $F$ distributed over this effective area $A_{eff}$. It represents the true stress experienced by the undamaged material ligaments within the microstructure.\n$$\n\\tilde{\\sigma} = \\frac{F}{A_{eff}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the effective area, $A_{eff}$, into the definition of effective stress, we obtain:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\sigma} = \\frac{F}{(1-D)A}\n$$\nThis expression provides the effective stress $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ purely in terms of the applied force $F$, the initial area $A$, and the damage variable $D$, as required. It is also useful to relate the effective stress $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ to the nominal stress $\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\sigma} = \\frac{1}{1-D} \\left( \\frac{F}{A} \\right) = \\frac{\\sigma}{1-D}\n$$\nThis fundamental relationship shows that for any non-zero damage ($D > 0$), the effective stress $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ is always greater than the nominal stress $\\sigma$. As damage approaches unity ($D \\to 1$), the effective stress approaches infinity, corresponding to material failure.\n\nThe problem statement also references the principle of strain equivalence. This principle posits that the strain response of a damaged material is governed by the same constitutive law as the virgin material, provided that the nominal stress $\\sigma$ is replaced by the effective stress $\\tilde{\\sigma}$. For a linear elastic material, the law for the virgin material is $\\epsilon = \\sigma / E$. According to the principle of strain equivalence, the strain $\\epsilon$ in the damaged material is given by:\n$$\n\\epsilon = \\frac{\\tilde{\\sigma}}{E} = \\frac{\\sigma}{E(1-D)}\n$$\nThis implies that the effect of damage is a degradation of the material's stiffness, with the effective Young's modulus being $\\tilde{E} = E(1-D)$. This confirms the internal consistency of the definitions used.\n\nThe problem requests the final expression for $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ in terms of $F$, $A$, and $D$. This is the derived expression. The requirement to express the answer in Pascals is a note on units: if $F$ is in Newtons ($N$) and $A$ is in square meters ($m^2$), then the resulting stress $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ will be correctly expressed in Pascals ($Pa = N/m^2$).\n\nThe final analytical expression is therefore:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\sigma} = \\frac{F}{(1-D)A}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{F}{(1-D)A}}$$", "id": "2912632"}, {"introduction": "Once we define effective stress, a natural question arises: what drives the growth of damage?

It is a standard problem in continuum damage mechanics. The provided definitions and principles are correct and sufficient for a unique solution.\n\nThe first objective is to derive an expression for the damage energy release rate, $Y$, as a function of the nominal Cauchy stress $\\sigma$, the damage variable $D$, and the virgin Young's modulus $E_0$.\n\nThe analysis begins with the Helmholtz free energy density. The principle of strain equivalence states that the constitutive law for the damaged material retains the form of the virgin material, but with the stress $\\sigma$ replaced by an effective stress $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ acting on the undamaged portion of the material. The effective stress is defined as $\\tilde{\\sigma} = \\frac{\\sigma}{1-D}$. The strain energy stored in the damaged body, represented by the Helmholtz free energy density $\\psi(\\varepsilon, D)$, can be expressed by scaling the undamaged free energy density $\\psi_0(\\varepsilon)$ by the volume fraction of intact material, $(1-D)$.\nGiven the undamaged Helmholtz free energy density $\\psi_{0}(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{1}{2} E_{0} \\varepsilon^{2}$, the free energy density for the damaged material is:\n$$\n\\psi(\\varepsilon, D) = (1-D) \\psi_0(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{1}{2} (1-D) E_{0} \\varepsilon^{2}\n$$\nThis formulation must be consistent with the given stress-strain relationship. In isothermal continuum mechanics, the stress is derived from the free energy density with respect to strain: $\\sigma = \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\varepsilon}$. Performing this differentiation, we have:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\varepsilon} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} (1-D) E_{0} \\varepsilon^{2} \\right) = (1-D) E_{0} \\varepsilon\n$$\nThis result matches the stress-strain law provided in the problem statement, $\\sigma = (1-D) E_{0} \\varepsilon$, thereby validating our expression for $\\psi(\\varepsilon, D)$.\n\nThe damage energy release rate, $Y$, is the thermodynamic force conjugate to the damage variable $D$, defined as the negative partial derivative of the Helmholtz free energy density with respect to $D$ at constant strain $\\varepsilon$:\n$$\nY = -\\frac{\\partial \\psi(\\varepsilon, D)}{\\partial D}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\psi(\\varepsilon, D)$:\n$$\nY = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial D} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} (1-D) E_{0} \\varepsilon^{2} \\right)\n$$\nSince the derivative is taken at fixed strain $\\varepsilon$, the term $\\frac{1}{2} E_{0} \\varepsilon^{2}$ is treated as a constant:\n$$\nY = -\\left(\\frac{1}{2} E_{0} \\varepsilon^{2}\\right) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial D}(1-D) = -\\left(\\frac{1}{2} E_{0} \\varepsilon^{2}\\right)(-1) = \\frac{1}{2} E_{0} \\varepsilon^{2}\n$$\nThis expression gives $Y$ in terms of strain $\\varepsilon$. The problem requires the expression in terms of stress $\\sigma$, damage $D$, and modulus $E_0$. To achieve this, we must eliminate $\\varepsilon$. From the constitutive law, we can express strain as:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\sigma}{(1-D) E_{0}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $Y$:\n$$\nY = \\frac{1}{2} E_{0} \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{(1-D) E_{0}} \\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} E_{0} \\frac{\\sigma^2}{(1-D)^2 E_{0}^2}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the final form for the damage energy release rate:\n$$\nY = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2 E_{0} (1-D)^2}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nThe second part is to evaluate $Y$ for the given numerical values: $E_{0} = 70$ GPa, $\\sigma = 140$ MPa, and $D = 0.3$. We must use consistent SI units.\nThe stress $\\sigma$ is given as $140$ MPa, which is $140 \\times 10^6$ Pa.\nThe virgin modulus $E_0$ is given as $70$ GPa, which is $70 \\times 10^9$ Pa.\nThe damage variable $D$ is $0.3$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $Y$:\n$$\nY = \\frac{(140 \\times 10^6)^2}{2 (70 \\times 10^9) (1 - 0.3)^2} = \\frac{(1.4 \\times 10^8)^2}{2 (7 \\times 10^{10}) (0.7)^2}\n$$\n$$\nY = \\frac{1.96 \\times 10^{16}}{(14 \\times 10^{10}) (0.49)} = \\frac{1.96 \\times 10^{16}}{6.86 \\times 10^{10}}\n$$\n$$\nY = \\frac{1.96}{6.86} \\times 10^{6} \\, \\text{J/m}^3 \\approx 0.28571428... \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{J/m}^3\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in units of Megajoules per cubic meter (MJ/m$^3$). Since $1$ MJ = $10^6$ J, we have:\n$$\nY \\approx 0.28571428... \\, \\text{MJ/m}^3\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$\nY \\approx 0.2857 \\, \\text{MJ/m}^3\n$$\n\nFinally, regarding the variation of $Y$ with increasing $D$ at a fixed nominal stress $\\sigma$: The derived expression is $Y = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2 E_{0} (1-D)^2}$. For a constant $\\sigma$ and $E_0$, $Y$ is proportional to $(1-D)^{-2}$. As the damage $D$ increases from $0$ towards $1$, the term $(1-D)$ decreases, and its square $(1-D)^2$ decreases even more rapidly. Since this term is in the denominator, $Y$ increases non-linearly and without bound as $D \\to 1$. Physically, this means that for a material held at a constant nominal stress, the thermodynamic force driving further damage growth becomes progressively stronger as the material degrades.
