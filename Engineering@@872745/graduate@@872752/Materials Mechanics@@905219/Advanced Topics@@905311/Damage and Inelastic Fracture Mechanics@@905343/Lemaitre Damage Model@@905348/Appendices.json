The setup is a standard exercise in computational or theoretical plasticity and damage.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will now be provided.\n\nThe foundation of the analysis rests on the constitutive relations provided. The Cauchy stress $\\sigma$ is related to the total strain $\\varepsilon$ and the internal variables $D$ and $\\varepsilon^p$. During unloading and reloading, the tangent stiffness $K_u$ is the rate of change of stress with respect to total strain. Given the assumption that plastic strain $\\varepsilon^p$ and damage $D$ are constant during this phase, we have $d\\varepsilon = d\\varepsilon^e$.\n\nThe stress-strain relation for the damaged material is derived from the effective stress concept:\n$$ \\sigma = (1-D) \\tilde{\\sigma} = (1-D) E_0 \\varepsilon^e $$\nThe tangent stiffness during unloading, $K_u$, is therefore:\n$$ K_u = \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\varepsilon} = \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\varepsilon^e} = (1-D)E_0 $$\nThis equation allows for the determination of the damage variable $D$ from the given moduli $E_0$ and $K_u$:\n$$ D = 1 - \\frac{K_u}{E_0} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ D = 1 - \\frac{150 \\,\\mathrm{GPa}}{200 \\,\\mathrm{GPa}} = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 $$\nThe damage accumulated during the initial loading phase is $D=0.25$.\n\nNext, we analyze the strain components. The total strain is $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon^e + \\varepsilon^p$. The residual strain $\\varepsilon_r$ is the total strain remaining after the specimen is fully unloaded to $\\sigma=0$. At $\\sigma=0$, the elastic strain $\\varepsilon^e$ is also zero, since $\\varepsilon^e = \\sigma / ((1-D)E_0) = 0$. Therefore, the residual strain must be equal to the permanent plastic strain:\n$$ \\varepsilon_r = \\varepsilon^p = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} $$\nThis is the plastic strain that was \"frozen\" at the point of unloading.\n\nWe now compute the two strains required for $\\Delta\\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}}$ at the target stress $\\sigma^{\\star} = 300 \\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 0.3 \\,\\mathrm{GPa}$.\n\nFirst, the strain on the virgin linear-elastic path, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{virgin}}$. This is the response of the undamaged material, governed by Hooke's law with modulus $E_0$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\text{virgin}}(\\sigma^{\\star}) = \\frac{\\sigma^{\\star}}{E_0} $$\n\nSecond, the strain on the reloading path, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{reload}}$. The reloading path follows the unloading line, which is characterized by the constant damaged stiffness $K_u = (1-D)E_0$ and the constant plastic strain $\\varepsilon^p = \\varepsilon_r$. The total strain is the sum of the elastic and plastic components:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\text{reload}}(\\sigma^{\\star}) = \\varepsilon^e(\\sigma^{\\star}) + \\varepsilon^p $$\nThe elastic strain on the reloading path is governed by the damaged modulus $K_u$:\n$$ \\varepsilon^e(\\sigma^{\\star}) = \\frac{\\sigma^{\\star}}{(1-D)E_0} = \\frac{\\sigma^{\\star}}{K_u} $$\nThus, the total strain on the reloading path is:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\text{reload}}(\\sigma^{\\star}) = \\frac{\\sigma^{\\star}}{K_u} + \\varepsilon_r $$\n\nThe total separation in strain, $\\Delta\\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}}$, is defined as their difference:\n$$ \\Delta\\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}} = \\varepsilon_{\\text{reload}}(\\sigma^{\\star}) - \\varepsilon_{\\text{virgin}}(\\sigma^{\\star}) = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma^{\\star}}{K_u} + \\varepsilon_r\\right) - \\frac{\\sigma^{\\star}}{E_0} $$\nRearranging this expression allows for the required additive decomposition:\n$$ \\Delta\\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}} = \\varepsilon_r + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma^{\\star}}{K_u} - \\frac{\\sigma^{\\star}}{E_0}\\right) $$\nThe first term, $\\varepsilon_r$, is the permanent offset in strain due to plastic deformation. This represents the contribution of plasticity to the total strain separation, which we denote $\\Delta\\varepsilon_p$:\n$$ \\Delta\\varepsilon_p = \\varepsilon_r $$\nThe second term represents the additional elastic strain that arises at stress $\\sigma^{\\star}$ because the material's stiffness has been reduced from $E_0$ to $K_u$ by damage. This is the contribution of damage, denoted $\\Delta\\varepsilon_D$:\n$$ \\Delta\\varepsilon_D = \\frac{\\sigma^{\\star}}{K_u} - \\frac{\\sigma^{\\star}}{E_0} = \\sigma^{\\star}\\left(\\frac{1}{K_u} - \\frac{1}{E_0}\\right) $$\nThus, we have the decomposition $\\Delta\\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}} = \\Delta\\varepsilon_p + \\Delta\\varepsilon_D$.\n\nThe problem asks for the fraction of $\\Delta\\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}}$ attributable to plasticity. This fraction, $f_p$, is given by:\n$$ f_p = \\frac{\\Delta\\varepsilon_p}{\\Delta\\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}}} = \\frac{\\Delta\\varepsilon_p}{\\Delta\\varepsilon_p + \\Delta\\varepsilon_D} $$\nWe now substitute the expressions and numerical values.\n$$ \\Delta\\varepsilon_p = \\varepsilon_r = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\varepsilon_D = (0.3 \\,\\mathrm{GPa}) \\left(\\frac{1}{150 \\,\\mathrm{GPa}} - \\frac{1}{200 \\,\\mathrm{GPa}}\\right) = 0.3 \\left(\\frac{4 - 3}{600}\\right) = \\frac{0.3}{600} = \\frac{1}{2000} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-3} $$\nThe total strain separation is:\n$$ \\Delta\\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-3}) + (0.5 \\times 10^{-3}) = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3} $$\nThe fraction attributable to plasticity is:\n$$ f_p = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.5 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{1.0}{1.5} = \\frac{2}{3} $$\nAs a decimal, this is $0.6666...$. Rounding to four significant figures as requested:\n$$ f_p \\approx 0.6667 $$\nThis result indicates that approximately two-thirds of the additional strain observed during reloading, relative to the virgin elastic response, is due to the permanent plastic deformation, while one-third is due to the stiffness reduction caused by material damage.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6667}$$", "id": "2897262"}, {"introduction": "To use the Lemaitre model for predictive simulations, we must translate its continuous differential equations into discrete steps that a computer can solve.

All necessary data and definitions are provided for a unique solution. We proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts as requested.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the damage energy release rate, $Y$. By definition, $Y$ is the thermodynamic force conjugate to the damage variable $D$, given by\n$$\nY := -\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial D} \\bigg|_{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^e}\n$$\nThe Helmholtz free-energy density is given as $\\psi = (1-D)\\,\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^e : \\mathbb{C}_0 : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^e$.

To express $Y$ in terms of the effective stress $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$, we use the effective constitutive relation $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\mathbb{C}_0 : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^e$. Inverting this relation gives the elastic strain as $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^e = \\mathbb{C}_0^{-1} : \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$, where $\\mathbb{C}_0^{-1}$ is the undamaged elastic compliance tensor. We can also write $Y$ as\n$$\nY = \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^e : \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^e$ in terms of $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$, we arrive at the general expression for $Y$:\n$$\nY = \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} : \\mathbb{C}_0^{-1} : \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}\n$$\nFor the specialization to a uniaxial stress state, we consider the effective stress tensor to have only one non-zero component, $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{11} = \\tilde{\\sigma}$, with all other components being zero. For an isotropic material, the corresponding elastic strain component is $\\varepsilon^e_{11} = \\tilde{\\sigma}/E$, where $E$ is the undamaged Young's modulus.

The double-dot product $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^e$ simplifies to $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{11}\\varepsilon^e_{11}$.

Yield Check**\nNext, we check if this elastic trial state is admissible by evaluating the yield function, $f = |\\tilde{\\sigma}| - (\\sigma_{y0} + H \\bar{\\varepsilon}^p) \\le 0$. For monotonic tension, $\\tilde{\\sigma}>0$, so the condition simplifies. The yield strength at the known state $n$ is $\\sigma_{y,n} = \\sigma_{y0} + H\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p_n$. The yield function at the trial state is evaluated as:\n$$ f^{\\text{tr}} = \\tilde{\\sigma}^{\\text{tr}}_{n+1} - (\\sigma_{y0} + H\\bar{\\varepsilon}^{p, \\text{tr}}_{n+1}) = \\tilde{\\sigma}^{\\text{tr}}_{n+1} - \\sigma_{y,n} $$\n- If $f^{\\text{tr}} \\le 0$, the elastic assumption is valid. The increment is purely elastic. The state variables are updated to their trial values, meaning $\\varepsilon^p_{n+1} = \\varepsilon^p_n$, $\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p_{n+1} = \\bar{\\varepsilon}^p_n$, and $D_{n+1} = D_n$. The effective stress is $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{n+1} = \\tilde{\\sigma}^{\\text{tr}}_{n+1}$. The Cauchy stress is $\\sigma_{n+1} = (1 - D_{n+1}) \\tilde{\\sigma}_{n+1} = (1 - D_n) \\tilde{\\sigma}^{\\text{tr}}_{n+1}$.\n- If $f^{\\text{tr}}  0$, the material has yielded, and a plastic-damage corrector step must be performed to enforce the consistency condition.\n\n**3. Plastic-Damage Corrector**\nWhen plasticity occurs, the state at the end of the increment must satisfy the integrated constitutive laws. The backward-Euler method dictates that all rate-dependent quantities are evaluated at the final time $t_{n+1}$.\n\nThe discrete evolution equations are:\n1.  **Plastic Strain:** Since the flow is associative and loading is monotonic, the plastic strain increment $\\Delta\\varepsilon^p$ equals the equivalent plastic strain increment $\\Delta\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p$. This increment is given by the plastic multiplier increment, $\\Delta\\lambda$, which we will denote as $\\Delta\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p$ for clarity in this 1D case.\n    $$ \\varepsilon^p_{n+1} = \\varepsilon^p_n + \\Delta\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p $$\n    $$ \\bar{\\varepsilon}^p_{n+1} = \\bar{\\varepsilon}^p_n + \\Delta\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p $$\n2.  **Effective Stress (Return Map):** The effective stress is updated based on the plastic strain increment.\n    $$ \\tilde{\\sigma}_{n+1} = E \\varepsilon^e_{n+1} = E(\\varepsilon_{n+1} - \\varepsilon^p_{n+1}) = E(\\varepsilon_{n+1} - \\varepsilon^p_n - \\Delta\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p) $$\n    Using the definition of the trial stress, we get the return mapping formula:\n    $$ \\tilde{\\sigma}_{n+1} = \\tilde{\\sigma}^{\\text{tr}}_{n+1} - E \\Delta\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p $$\n3.  **Consistency Condition:** The final state must lie on the expanded yield surface.\n    $$ f_{n+1} = \\tilde{\\sigma}_{n+1} - (\\sigma_{y0} + H\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p_{n+1}) = 0 $$\nBy substituting the update rules for $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{n+1}$ and $\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p_{n+1}$ into the consistency condition, we can solve for the unknown plastic increment $\\Delta\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p$:\n$$ (\\tilde{\\sigma}^{\\text{tr}}_{n+1} - E \\Delta\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p) - (\\sigma_{y0} + H(\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p_n + \\Delta\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p)) = 0 $$\nRearranging to isolate $\\Delta\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p$:\n$$ \\tilde{\\sigma}^{\\text{tr}}_{n+1} - (\\sigma_{y0} + H\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p_n) = (E + H) \\Delta\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p $$\nThe left side is the trial yield function, $f^{\\text{tr}}$. This provides a closed-form solution for the plastic increment:\n$$ \\Delta\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p = \\frac{f^{\\text{tr}}}{E + H} $$\nWith $\\Delta\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p$ known, the plastic strains and effective stress at $n+1$ are computed.\n\n4.  **Damage Update:** The damage evolution is coupled to the plastic flow. Using the backward-Euler rule on $\\dot{D} = (Y/S)^s \\dot{\\bar{\\varepsilon}}^p$:\n    $$ D_{n+1} = D_n + \\left(\\frac{Y_{n+1}}{S}\\right)^s \\Delta\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p $$\n    The energy release rate $Y_{n+1}$ is evaluated at the end-of-step state:\n    $$ Y_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2} E (\\varepsilon^e_{n+1})^2 = \\frac{1}{2E} (\\tilde{\\sigma}_{n+1})^2 $$\n    Since $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{n+1}$ is already determined from the plastic corrector, $Y_{n+1}$ can be computed, and then $D_{n+1}$ is updated sequentially.\n\n5.  **Final Cauchy Stress:** Finally, the Cauchy stress is calculated using the updated effective stress and damage variables:\n    $$ \\sigma_{n+1} = (1 - D_{n+1}) \\tilde{\\sigma}_{n+1} $$\nThis sequential update procedure is applied for each increment in the prescribed strain path to determine the final stress state.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the final Cauchy stress in a 1D bar under monotonic tension using a\n    Lemaitre-type coupled damage-plasticity model.
