We shall proceed to derive the full mathematical formulation from first principles and then evaluate each of the given options.\n\nThe formulation consists of three sets of field equations valid within the domain $\\Omega$, and a set of boundary and regularity conditions.\n\n**1. Governing Field Equations in $\\Omega = \\{(r,\\theta)\\,:\\, r0,\\,-\\alpha\\le \\theta \\le +\\alpha\\}$**\n\n**1.1. Balance of Linear Momentum (Equilibrium Equations)**\nIn the absence of body forces, the equilibrium equations are given by the divergence of the Cauchy stress tensor being zero, $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{0}$. In polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, this vector equation yields two scalar component equations:\n\nThe $r$-component is:\n$$ \\dfrac{\\partial \\sigma_{rr}}{\\partial r} + \\dfrac{1}{r}\\dfrac{\\partial \\sigma_{r\\theta}}{\\partial \\theta} + \\dfrac{\\sigma_{rr}-\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}}{r} = 0 $$\nThe $\\theta$-component is:\n$$ \\dfrac{\\partial \\sigma_{r\\theta}}{\\partial r} + \\dfrac{1}{r}\\dfrac{\\partial \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}}{\\partial \\theta} + \\dfrac{2\\sigma_{r\\theta}}{r} = 0 $$\nThese are the exact equations of equilibrium in polar coordinates for a static continuum.\n\n**1.2. Kinematics (Strain-Displacement Relations)**\nFor small deformations, the components of the infinitesimal strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ are related to the displacement components $(u_r, u_\\theta)$ in polar coordinates as follows:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{rr} = \\dfrac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial r} $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = \\dfrac{1}{r}\\dfrac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta} + \\dfrac{u_r}{r} $$\nThe shear strain component is:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{r\\theta} = \\dfrac{1}{2}\\left( \\dfrac{1}{r}\\dfrac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial \\theta} + \\dfrac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial r} - \\dfrac{u_\\theta}{r} \\right) $$\n\n**1.3. Constitutive Law (Hooke's Law)**\nFor a homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic material, the stress-strain relationship is given by Hooke's law. For plane strain conditions, the strain component $\\varepsilon_{zz}$ is zero. The in-plane components are related by:\n$$ \\sigma_{ij} = \\lambda \\delta_{ij} \\varepsilon_{kk} + 2\\mu \\varepsilon_{ij} $$\nwhere $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ are the Lamé constants, and $\\varepsilon_{kk} = \\varepsilon_{rr} + \\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta}$ is the trace of the in-plane strain tensor.\nExplicitly, the stress components are:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr} = \\lambda (\\varepsilon_{rr} + \\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta}) + 2\\mu \\varepsilon_{rr} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = \\lambda (\\varepsilon_{rr} + \\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta}) + 2\\mu \\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{r\\theta} = 2\\mu \\varepsilon_{r\\theta} $$\n\n**2. Boundary and Regularity Conditions**\n\n**2.1. Condition at $\\theta = +\\alpha$**\nThe face at $\\theta = +\\alpha$ is traction-free. The traction vector on a surface with unit normal $\\boldsymbol{n}$ is $\\boldsymbol{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\boldsymbol{n}$. For the surface $\\theta = +\\alpha$, the outward unit normal vector is $\\boldsymbol{n} = \\boldsymbol{e}_\\theta$. The traction vector is thus:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{t} = \\sigma_{r\\theta}\\boldsymbol{e}_r + \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}\\boldsymbol{e}_\\theta $$\nSetting the traction vector to zero, $\\boldsymbol{t} = \\boldsymbol{0}$, requires both components to be zero. Thus, for all $r  0$:\n$$ \\sigma_{r\\theta}(r, +\\alpha) = 0 $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r, +\\alpha) = 0 $$\n\n**2.2. Condition at $\\theta = -\\alpha$**\nThe face at $\\theta = -\\alpha$ is perfectly clamped. This means the displacement vector is zero on this boundary. For all $r  0$:\n$$ u_r(r, -\\alpha) = 0 $$\n$$ u_\\theta(r, -\\alpha) = 0 $$\n\n**2.3. Condition near the Apex ($r \\to 0$)**\nThe fields must be \"physically admissible\". This is a regularity condition ensuring that pathologies are excluded. Specifically, it requires that the total strain energy stored in any neighborhood of the apex $r=0$ must be finite. As the strain energy density is proportional to $\\sigma_{ij}\\varepsilon_{ij} \\sim (\\text{stress})^2$, this requires that the integral of $(\\text{stress})^2$ over a small area near the origin must be finite. This condition limits the strength of any stress singularity at the apex. A common statement is that stresses must be square-integrable, $\\sigma_{ij} \\in L^2_{\\text{loc}}$. Displacements are typically required to be bounded.\n\n**2.4. Condition in the Far Field ($r \\to \\infty$)**\nThe problem states there is no remote loading and the fields are self-equilibrated. This implies that stresses, strains, and displacements must decay to zero as $r \\to \\infty$. In particular:\n$$ \\sigma_{ij}(r, \\theta) \\to 0 \\quad \\text{as } r \\to \\infty $$\n\nNow, we evaluate each option against this complete and correct formulation.\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\n- **Governing equations**: Both equilibrium equations in polar coordinates are stated correctly.\n- **Kinematics**: All three strain-displacement relations are stated correctly.\n- **Constitutive relations**: The plane strain versions of Hooke's law are stated correctly.\n- **Boundary and regularity conditions**:\n  1) The traction-free conditions at $\\theta=+\\alpha$, $\\sigma_{r\\theta}(r,+\\alpha)=0$ and $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r,+\\alpha)=0$, are correct.\n  2) The clamped conditions at $\\theta=-\\alpha$, $u_r(r,-\\alpha)=0$ and $u_\\theta(r,-\\alpha)=0$, are correct.\n  3) The apex admissibility condition is correctly stated as requiring finite strain energy, with a proper interpretation.\n  4) The far-field condition of stresses decaying to zero is correct for a self-equilibrated system.\n\nAll parts of Option A are precisely correct and together form a complete description of the boundary value problem.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\n- **Governing equations**: The stated equilibrium equations are incorrect. They are missing the terms $(\\sigma_{rr}-\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta})/r$ in the first equation and $2\\sigma_{r\\theta}/r$ in the second. These terms are non-zero and are a consequence of the curvature of the coordinate lines in a polar system.\n- **Kinematics**: The expressions for $\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta}$ and $\\varepsilon_{r\\theta}$ are incorrect. $\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta}$ is missing the $u_r/r$ term, and the expression for $\\varepsilon_{r\\theta}$ is missing the $-u_\\theta/r$ term.\n- **Boundary conditions**: The traction-free condition is incorrectly stated as $\\sigma_{rr}=0$ and $\\sigma_{r\\theta}=0$; it should be $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}=0$ and $\\sigma_{r\\theta}=0$. The clamped condition is incorrectly stated as $u_r=0$ and $\\partial u_\\theta/\\partial r=0$; it should be $u_r=0$ and $u_\\theta=0$.\n- **Regularity conditions**: The apex and far-field conditions are missing.\n\nOption B is fundamentally flawed in every aspect of the formulation.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\n- **Governing equations, kinematics, constitutive relations**: These are stated to be the same as in A, which is correct.\n- **Boundary conditions**: The boundary conditions are swapped. Option C applies the traction-free condition to the face $\\theta=-\\alpha$ and the clamped condition to the face $\\theta=+\\alpha$. This directly contradicts the problem description.\n\nOption C describes a different physical problem.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n- **Formulation**: This option switches to an Airy stress function formulation. While valid for 2D elastostatics, it is an alternative method, not a direct statement of the governing PDEs as requested. More importantly, it must still satisfy the correct boundary conditions.\n- **Boundary conditions**:\n  1) The traction-free condition at $\\theta=+\\alpha$ is correctly stated in terms of stresses.\n  2) The clamped condition at $\\theta=-\\alpha$ is incorrectly formulated. A clamped condition is a displacement condition ($u_r=0, u_\\theta=0$). Option D states it in terms of stresses ($\\sigma_{rr}=0, \\sigma_{r\\theta}=0$), which would correspond to a simply supported or roller boundary, not a clamped one. Expressing displacement boundary conditions in terms of an Airy stress function requires integrating the constitutive and kinematic equations, leading to complex integral conditions on $\\Phi$, not simple algebraic ones on stresses.\n\nThe formulation of the clamped boundary condition in Option D is fundamentally wrong.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, only Option A provides a complete and correct formulation of the specified mixed boundary value problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2881098"}, {"introduction": "The behavior of stress and displacement near a wedge tip is governed by a set of characteristic exponents, or eigenvalues $\\lambda$.

The problem is two-dimensional, meaning all fields are independent of the $z$-coordinate.\n\nFirst, we establish the kinematic relations, which connect strain to displacement. In polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, the engineering shear strain components are given by:\n$$ \\gamma_{rz} = \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial r} + \\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial z} $$\n$$ \\gamma_{\\theta z} = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial z} $$\nSubstituting the antiplane displacement field $u_z = w(r, \\theta)$, where $w$ is independent of $z$, and $u_r = u_\\theta = 0$, the only non-zero strain components are:\n$$ \\gamma_{rz} = \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial r} $$\n$$ \\gamma_{\\theta z} = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\theta} $$\nAll other strain components ($\\epsilon_{rr}$, $\\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta}$, $\\epsilon_{zz}$, $\\gamma_{r\\theta}$) are identically zero.\n\nNext, we apply the constitutive law for an isotropic, homogeneous, linear elastic solid (Hooke's Law). The shear stresses are related to the shear strains through the shear modulus, $G$:\n$$ \\tau_{rz} = G \\gamma_{rz} = G \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial r} $$\n$$ \\tau_{\\theta z} = G \\gamma_{\\theta z} = G \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\theta} $$\nAll other stress components are zero.\n\nFinally, we enforce the static equilibrium conditions in the absence of body forces. The equilibrium equations in polar coordinates are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{rr}}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial \\tau_{r\\theta}}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{rz}}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\tau_{rr} - \\tau_{\\theta\\theta}}{r} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{r\\theta}}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial \\tau_{\\theta\\theta}}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{\\theta z}}{\\partial z} + \\frac{2\\tau_{r\\theta}}{r} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{rz}}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial \\tau_{\\theta z}}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{zz}}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\tau_{rz}}{r} = 0 $$\nGiven that only $\\tau_{rz}$ and $\\tau_{\\theta z}$ are non-zero and are independent of $z$, the first two equations are trivially satisfied ($0=0$). The third equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{rz}}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial \\tau_{\\theta z}}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\tau_{rz}}{r} = 0 $$\nSubstituting the constitutive relations for the stresses into this equilibrium equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(G \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial r}\\right) + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}\\left(G \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\theta}\\right) + \\frac{1}{r}\\left(G \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial r}\\right) = 0 $$\nSince the material is homogeneous, the shear modulus $G$ is a constant and can be factored out and cancelled, as $G \\neq 0$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial \\theta^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial r} = 0 $$\nThis equation can be recognized as the Laplace equation for the function $w(r, \\theta)$ in polar coordinates:\n$$ \\nabla^2 w = \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial \\theta^2} = 0 $$\n\nb) Solution for Clamped Faces ($w=0$)\n\nWe seek a separated solution of the form $w(r, \\theta) = r^{\\lambda}\\Phi(\\theta)$.

The fundamental difference lies in the corresponding eigenfunctions $\\Phi_n(\\theta)$. For the clamped case, odd $n$ corresponds to symmetric modes (cosine functions) and even $n$ to antisymmetric modes (sine functions). For the traction-free case, this is reversed: odd $n$ corresponds to antisymmetric modes (sine functions) and even $n$ to symmetric modes (cosine functions).\n\nThe final answer requires the expression for the clamped-face eigenvalues $\\lambda_n$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\lambda_n = \\frac{n \\pi}{2 \\alpha}}$$", "id": "2881106"}, {"introduction": "Many problems in two-dimensional elasticity can be powerfully simplified using techniques from complex analysis.

The connection to potential theory (Laplace's equation) is fundamental. The use of conformal mapping is a standard and powerful technique for solving two-dimensional Laplace problems in complex geometries. The problem is well-posed, with sufficient information to determine a unique solution for the exponent $\\lambda$. The language is precise and objective. All conditions are internally consistent and physically meaningful.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be constructed as specified.\n\nThe solution proceeds in four stages as mandated by the problem.\n\n**1. Construction of the Conformal Map**\nWe represent the wedge domain $\\Omega$ in the complex plane $z = x+iy = re^{i\\theta}$. The wedge is the set of points $z$ such that $|\\arg(z)|  \\alpha$. We seek a conformal map $\\zeta = f(z)$ that transforms this wedge into a half-plane. A power function of the form $f(z) = z^k$ is a natural choice for changing angles at the origin. The wedge has an angular width of $2\\alpha$. A half-plane has an angular width of $\\pi$. To map the wedge to a region of angular width $\\pi$, we require the exponent $k$ to satisfy $k \\cdot (2\\alpha) = \\pi$, which yields $k = \\frac{\\pi}{2\\alpha}$.\n\nLet us define the map:\n$$ \\zeta = f(z) = z^{\\pi/(2\\alpha)} $$\nA point $z = re^{i\\theta}$ in the wedge has its argument $\\theta$ in the interval $(-\\alpha, \\alpha)$. Under the map $f$, the image point $\\zeta$ is given by:\n$$ \\zeta = \\left(re^{i\\theta}\\right)^{\\pi/(2\\alpha)} = r^{\\pi/(2\\alpha)} e^{i\\theta\\pi/(2\\alpha)} $$\nThe argument of $\\zeta$ is $\\phi = \\frac{\\pi\\theta}{2\\alpha}$. As $\\theta$ varies from $-\\alpha$ to $\\alpha$, $\\phi$ varies from $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The image of the wedge $\\Omega$ is therefore the right half-plane $\\Omega' = \\{\\zeta = \\xi+i\\eta \\,:\\, \\xi0\\}$. The boundary of the wedge, the rays $\\theta=\\alpha$ and $\\theta=-\\alpha$, are mapped to the boundary of the half-plane, which is the imaginary axis $\\xi=0$. The apex of the wedge, $z=0$, is mapped to the origin $\\zeta=0$.\n\n**2. Boundary Value Problem in the Mapped Domain**\nThe displacement field $w(r,\\theta)$ is transformed into a function $W(\\xi, \\eta)$ in the mapped domain, where $w(z) = W(f(z))$. The problem states that harmonicity is invariant under conformal maps, so $W$ must satisfy Laplace's equation in $\\Omega'$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 W}{\\partial \\xi^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 W}{\\partial \\eta^2} = 0 $$\nThe homogeneous Neumann condition on the wedge faces $\\theta=\\pm\\alpha$ also transforms. Invariance of the homogeneous Neumann condition means that the normal derivative of $W$ must be zero on the boundary of $\\Omega'$. The boundary of the right half-plane is the line $\\xi=0$, and its outward normal vector is in the $-\\xi$ direction. Thus, the boundary condition is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial \\xi}\\bigg|_{\\xi=0} = 0 $$\nWe require a simple, nontrivial harmonic function $W(\\xi, \\eta)$ that satisfies this condition and is bounded near the origin $\\zeta=0$. The simplest class of harmonic functions are linear polynomials of the form $A\\xi + B\\eta + C$. Applying the Neumann condition:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\xi} (A\\xi + B\\eta + C) \\bigg|_{\\xi=0} = A = 0 $$\nThe solution must be of the form $W(\\xi, \\eta) = B\\eta + C$. To obtain a non-trivial solution that is not identically constant, we must have $B \\neq 0$. This function is bounded at $\\zeta=0$. For simplicity, we choose $B=1$ and $C=0$. Our solution in the mapped plane is:\n$$ W(\\xi, \\eta) = \\eta $$\nThis corresponds to the imaginary part of the analytic function $g(\\zeta)=-i\\zeta$, so it is indeed harmonic.\n\n**3. Pull-Back of the Solution**\nWe now pull this solution back to the original wedge domain $\\Omega$ using the inverse of the conformal map. This is achieved by expressing $\\eta$ in terms of $r$ and $\\theta$.\nFrom our definition of the map $\\zeta = f(z) = \\xi + i\\eta$, we have:\n$$ \\xi + i\\eta = r^{\\pi/(2\\alpha)} \\left( \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi\\theta}{2\\alpha}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi\\theta}{2\\alpha}\\right) \\right) $$\nEquating the imaginary parts, we find $\\eta(r, \\theta)$:\n$$ \\eta(r, \\theta) = r^{\\pi/(2\\alpha)} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi\\theta}{2\\alpha}\\right) $$\nThe solution for the displacement field in the wedge is therefore:\n$$ w(r, \\theta) = r^{\\pi/(2\\alpha)} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi\\theta}{2\\alpha}\\right) $$\nWe verify this solution. Its harmonicity is guaranteed by the conformal mapping principle. The boundary conditions are checked directly. Let $\\lambda = \\frac{\\pi}{2\\alpha}$. Then $w(r,\\theta)=r^{\\lambda}\\sin(\\lambda\\theta)$.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\theta} = \\lambda r^{\\lambda} \\cos(\\lambda\\theta) $$\nAt $\\theta = \\pm\\alpha$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\theta}\\bigg|_{\\theta=\\pm\\alpha} = \\lambda r^{\\lambda} \\cos(\\pm\\lambda\\alpha) = \\lambda r^{\\lambda} \\cos\\left(\\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2\\alpha}\\alpha\\right) = \\lambda r^{\\lambda} \\cos\\left(\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = 0 $$\nThe solution correctly satisfies the homogeneous Neumann conditions.\n\n**4. Identification of the Exponent $\\lambda$**\nThe problem asks for the leading order behavior of the solution near the apex, $w(r, \\theta) \\sim r^{\\lambda} g(\\theta)$ as $r \\to 0^{+}$. The solution we have derived is precisely of this form:\n$$ w(r, \\theta) = r^{\\pi/(2\\alpha)} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi\\theta}{2\\alpha}\\right) $$\nBy constructing the simplest non-trivial solution in the mapped domain, we have isolated the eigenmode with the smallest positive exponent, which dictates the leading-order singular behavior of the field near the wedge tip.\nBy direct comparison, we identify the function $g(\\theta) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi\\theta}{2\\alpha})$ and the exponent $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\pi}{2\\alpha} $$\nThis exponent governs the strength of the stress singularity at the wedge apex.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{2\\alpha}}$$", "id": "2881132"}]}
