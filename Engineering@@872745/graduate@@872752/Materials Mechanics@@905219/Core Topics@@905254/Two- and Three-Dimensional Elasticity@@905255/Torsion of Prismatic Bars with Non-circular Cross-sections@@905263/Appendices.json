For a linearly elastic, isotropic material, the only non-zero stress components are the shear stresses $\\tau_{xz}$ and $\\tau_{yz}$. Using Hooke's law, these are related to the engineering shear strains $\\gamma_{xz}$ and $\\gamma_{yz}$:\n$$ \\gamma_{xz} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} = -k y + \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} \\implies \\tau_{xz} = G \\gamma_{xz} = G \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} - k y \\right) $$\n$$ \\gamma_{yz} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y} = k x + \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y} \\implies \\tau_{yz} = G \\gamma_{yz} = G \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y} + k x \\right) $$\nwhere $G$ is the shear modulus.\n\nThe equilibrium equation, in the absence of body forces, for the $z$-direction is $\\frac{\\partial \\tau_{xz}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{yz}}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{zz}}{\\partial z} = 0$. For pure torsion, all normal stresses are zero, so $\\sigma_{zz}=0$. The equilibrium equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{xz}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{yz}}{\\partial y} = 0 $$\nThis equation is satisfied identically by introducing the Prandtl stress function, $\\phi(x,y)$, defined such that:\n$$ \\tau_{xz} = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y} $$\n$$ \\tau_{yz} = -\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} $$\n\nNow, we derive the governing Partial Differential Equation (PDE) for $\\phi(x,y)$.

This translates to $\\sigma_{xz}n_x + \\sigma_{yz}n_y = 0$, which in terms of $\\phi$ becomes $\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial y}n_x - \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x}n_y = 0$. This implies that the directional derivative of $\\phi$ along the boundary is zero, so $\\phi$ must be constant on $\\partial\\Omega$. Without loss of generality, we set this constant to zero, yielding the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition $\\phi=0$ on $\\partial\\Omega$.\n\nThe total applied torque $T$ is the resultant of the shear stresses over the cross-section:\n$$\nT = \\int_{\\Omega} (x\\sigma_{yz} - y\\sigma_{xz}) \\,\\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{\\Omega} \\left(-x\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x} - y\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial y}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nUsing integration by parts (Green's first identity), and noting that $\\phi=0$ on $\\partial\\Omega$, we find:\n$$\nT = \\int_{\\Omega} \\phi\\,\\mathrm{d}A + \\int_{\\Omega} \\phi\\,\\mathrm{d}A = 2\\int_{\\Omega} \\phi\\,\\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nThe torsional rigidity $J$ is defined by the relation $T = G J k$. Thus, $J = \\frac{T}{Gk} = \\frac{2}{Gk}\\int_{\\Omega}\\phi\\,\\mathrm{d}A$. Let us define a rescaled potential $u(x,y) = \\phi/(Gk)$. This potential $u$ satisfies the BVP:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 u = -2 \\quad \\text{in } \\Omega, \\qquad u = 0 \\quad \\text{on } \\partial\\Omega\n$$\nThe torsional rigidity is then expressed in terms of $u$ as $J = 2\\int_{\\Omega}u\\,\\mathrm{d}A$.\n\nSecond, we derive the variational lower bound. Let $u_0$ be the exact solution to the BVP $\\nabla^2 u = -2$ with $u=0$ on $\\partial\\Omega$. Let $v(x,y)$ be any sufficiently smooth trial function that also vanishes on the boundary $\\partial\\Omega$. We begin with the integral of the trial function over the domain:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} v\\,\\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{\\Omega} v \\left(\\frac{\\nabla^2 u_0}{-2}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}A = -\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega} v \\nabla^2 u_0 \\,\\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nUsing Green's second identity, $\\int_{\\Omega}(v\\nabla^2 u_0 - u_0\\nabla^2 v)\\,\\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{\\partial\\Omega}(v\\frac{\\partial u_0}{\\partial n} - u_0\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial n})\\,\\mathrm{d}s$, and noting that both $u_0$ and $v$ are zero on the boundary $\\partial\\Omega$, the boundary integral vanishes. Thus, $\\int_{\\Omega} v\\nabla^2 u_0 \\,\\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{\\Omega} u_0\\nabla^2 v \\,\\mathrm{d}A$. This gives:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} v\\,\\mathrm{d}A = -\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega} u_0 \\nabla^2 v \\,\\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nApplying Green's first identity, $\\int_{\\Omega} u_0 \\nabla^2 v \\,\\mathrm{d}A = -\\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u_0 \\cdot \\nabla v \\,\\mathrm{d}A + \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} u_0 \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial n}\\,\\mathrm{d}s$. Again, the boundary term is zero. Therefore:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} v\\,\\mathrm{d}A = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u_0 \\cdot \\nabla v \\,\\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nWe now apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for integrals: $(\\int f g)^2 \\le (\\int f^2)(\\int g^2)$.\n$$\n\\left(\\int_{\\Omega} v\\,\\mathrm{d}A\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u_0 \\cdot \\nabla v \\,\\mathrm{d}A\\right)^2 \\le \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla u_0|^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}A\\right)\\left(\\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla v|^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}A\\right)\n$$\nFor the exact solution $u_0$, we can show that $\\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla u_0|^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}A = J$. Using Green's first identity again:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla u_0|^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}A = -\\int_{\\Omega} u_0 \\nabla^2 u_0 \\,\\mathrm{d}A + \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} u_0\\frac{\\partial u_0}{\\partial n}\\,\\mathrm{d}s = -\\int_{\\Omega} u_0(-2)\\,\\mathrm{d}A = 2\\int_{\\Omega} u_0\\,\\mathrm{d}A = J\n$$\nSubstituting this into the inequality, we obtain:\n$$\n\\left(\\int_{\\Omega} v\\,\\mathrm{d}A\\right)^2 \\le \\frac{J}{4} \\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla v|^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nRearranging this inequality provides the desired variational lower bound for the torsional rigidity $J$:\n$$\nJ \\ge \\frac{4\\left(\\displaystyle\\int_{\\Omega} v\\,\\mathrm{d}A\\right)^{2}}{\\displaystyle\\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla v|^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}A}\n$$\n\nThird, we evaluate this lower bound for the specified rectangular cross-section $\\Omega = [-a, a] \\times [-b, b]$ and the trial function $v(x,y) = (1 - \\frac{x^2}{a^2})(1 - \\frac{y^2}{b^2})$. We must compute two integrals. The first is the integral of $v$ over $\\Omega$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} v\\,\\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{-a}^{a} \\int_{-b}^{b} \\left(1 - \\frac{x^2}{a^2}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{y^2}{b^2}\\right)\\mathrm{d}y\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\left[\\int_{-a}^{a} \\left(1-\\frac{x^2}{a^2}\\right)\\mathrm{d}x\\right] \\left[\\int_{-b}^{b} \\left(1-\\frac{y^2}{b^2}\\right)\\mathrm{d}y\\right]\n$$\nThe integral in $x$ evaluates to $\\left[x - \\frac{x^3}{3a^2}\\right]_{-a}^a = (a - \\frac{a}{3}) - (-a + \\frac{a}{3}) = \\frac{4a}{3}$. The integral in $y$ is analogous, yielding $\\frac{4b}{3}$. Thus:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} v\\,\\mathrm{d}A = \\left(\\frac{4a}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{4b}{3}\\right) = \\frac{16ab}{9}\n$$\nThe second integral involves the squared magnitude of the gradient of $v$. The partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{2x}{a^2}\\left(1-\\frac{y^2}{b^2}\\right), \\qquad \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{2y}{b^2}\\left(1-\\frac{x^2}{a^2}\\right)\n$$\nThen $|\\nabla v|^2 = (\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x})^2 + (\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y})^2 = \\frac{4x^2}{a^4}(1-\\frac{y^2}{b^2})^2 + \\frac{4y^2}{b^4}(1-\\frac{x^2}{a^2})^2$. We integrate this over $\\Omega$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla v|^2\\,\\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{-a}^{a}\\int_{-b}^{b} \\left[\\frac{4x^2}{a^4}\\left(1-\\frac{y^2}{b^2}\\right)^2 + \\frac{4y^2}{b^4}\\left(1-\\frac{x^2}{a^2}\\right)^2\\right] \\mathrm{d}y\\,\\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nThis splits into two terms. The first term is:\n$$\n\\frac{4}{a^4}\\left(\\int_{-a}^{a}x^2\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\right)\\left(\\int_{-b}^{b}\\left(1-\\frac{y^2}{b^2}\\right)^2\\mathrm{d}y\\right) = \\frac{4}{a^4}\\left(\\frac{2a^3}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{16b}{15}\\right) = \\frac{128b}{45a}\n$$\nwhere we used $\\int_{-b}^{b}(1 - 2\\frac{y^2}{b^2} + \\frac{y^4}{b^4})\\,\\mathrm{d}y = [y - \\frac{2y^3}{3b^2} + \\frac{y^5}{5b^4}]_{-b}^b = 2(b - \\frac{2b}{3} + \\frac{b}{5}) = \\frac{16b}{15}$. By symmetry, the second term is $\\frac{128a}{45b}$. So the integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla v|^2\\,\\mathrm{d}A = \\frac{128b}{45a} + \\frac{128a}{45b} = \\frac{128}{45}\\left(\\frac{b}{a}+\\frac{a}{b}\\right) = \\frac{128(a^2+b^2)}{45ab}\n$$\nSubstituting these integrals into the variational formula yields the lower bound on torsional rigidity, $J_{\\mathrm{lb}}$:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{lb}} = \\frac{4\\left(\\frac{16ab}{9}\\right)^2}{\\frac{128(a^2+b^2)}{45ab}} = \\frac{4 \\cdot 256 \\cdot a^2 b^2}{81} \\cdot \\frac{45ab}{128(a^2+b^2)} = \\frac{4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 45}{81} \\frac{a^3 b^3}{a^2+b^2} = \\frac{360}{81} \\frac{a^3 b^3}{a^2+b^2} = \\frac{40}{9} \\frac{a^3 b^3}{a^2+b^2}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the lower bound for the dimensionless parameter $\\eta = \\frac{J(a^2+b^2)}{a^3b^3}$. Using our result for $J_{\\mathrm{lb}}$:\n$$\n\\eta_{\\mathrm{lb}} = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{lb}}(a^2+b^2)}{a^3b^3} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{40}{9} \\frac{a^3b^3}{a^2+b^2}\\right)(a^2+b^2)}{a^3b^3} = \\frac{40}{9}\n$$\nThis is the final simplified analytic expression for the lower bound of the dimensionless torsional rigidity parameter.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{40}{9}}\n$$", "id": "2927239"}]}
