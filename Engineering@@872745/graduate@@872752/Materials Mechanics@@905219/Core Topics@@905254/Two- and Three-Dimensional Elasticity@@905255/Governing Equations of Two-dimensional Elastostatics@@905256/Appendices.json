It is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for its resolution. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem consists of two parts. First, the derivation of the Lamé constants $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$, and the bulk modulus $\\kappa$, from Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$. Second, the interpretation of the mechanical roles of these constants in two-dimensional ($2$D) elasticity, specifically for plane stress and plane strain conditions.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Elastic Constants**\n\nWe begin with the general isotropic linear elastic constitutive relation, also known as Hooke's law, which connects the stress tensor $\\sigma_{ij}$ to the strain tensor $\\epsilon_{ij}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij} = \\lambda (\\epsilon_{kk}) \\delta_{ij} + 2\\mu \\epsilon_{ij}\n$$\nHere, $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ are the Lamé constants, $\\epsilon_{kk} = \\epsilon_{11} + \\epsilon_{22} + \\epsilon_{33}$ is the trace of the strain tensor representing the volumetric strain, and $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nTo relate $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ to $E$ and $\\nu$, we consider the case of a simple uniaxial stress test. We apply a stress $\\sigma_{11}$ along the $x_1$-axis, such that all other stress components are zero:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{11} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFrom the definitions of Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$, the strain components are:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{11} = \\frac{\\sigma_{11}}{E}, \\quad \\epsilon_{22} = -\\nu \\epsilon_{11}, \\quad \\epsilon_{33} = -\\nu \\epsilon_{11}\n$$\nAll shear strains $\\epsilon_{ij}$ for $i \\neq j$ are zero. The volumetric strain is $\\epsilon_{kk} = \\epsilon_{11} + \\epsilon_{22} + \\epsilon_{33} = \\epsilon_{11} - \\nu\\epsilon_{11} - \\nu\\epsilon_{11} = \\epsilon_{11}(1 - 2\\nu)$.\n\nWe now substitute these conditions into the constitutive equation. For the component $\\sigma_{22}$, which is zero:\n$$\n\\sigma_{22} = 0 = \\lambda (\\epsilon_{kk}) + 2\\mu \\epsilon_{22} = \\lambda \\epsilon_{11}(1 - 2\\nu) + 2\\mu (-\\nu \\epsilon_{11})\n$$\nSince $\\epsilon_{11}$ is non-zero, we can divide by it to obtain a relationship between $\\lambda$, $\\mu$, and $\\nu$:\n$$\n\\lambda(1 - 2\\nu) - 2\\mu\\nu = 0 \\implies \\lambda = \\frac{2\\mu\\nu}{1 - 2\\nu}\n$$\nThis first result expresses $\\lambda$ in terms of $\\mu$ and $\\nu$.\n\nNext, we consider the component $\\sigma_{11}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{11} = \\lambda(\\epsilon_{kk}) + 2\\mu\\epsilon_{11} = \\lambda\\epsilon_{11}(1 - 2\\nu) + 2\\mu\\epsilon_{11}\n$$\nDividing by $\\epsilon_{11}$ and using the definition $E = \\sigma_{11}/\\epsilon_{11}$:\n$$\nE = \\lambda(1 - 2\\nu) + 2\\mu\n$$\nNow, substitute the expression for $\\lambda(1 - 2\\nu)$ from our first result:\n$$\nE = (2\\mu\\nu) + 2\\mu = 2\\mu(1 + \\nu)\n$$\nFrom this, we solve for the shear modulus $\\mu$, also known as the second Lamé parameter or rigidity modulus:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{E}{2(1 + \\nu)}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\mu$ back into the relation for $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{2\\nu}{1 - 2\\nu} \\mu = \\frac{2\\nu}{1 - 2\\nu} \\left( \\frac{E}{2(1 + \\nu)} \\right) = \\frac{E\\nu}{(1 + \\nu)(1 - 2\\nu)}\n$$\nThis gives the expression for Lamé's first parameter $\\lambda$.\n\nFinally, we derive the bulk modulus $\\kappa$. The bulk modulus relates the mean stress (hydrostatic stress) $\\sigma_m = \\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_{kk}$ to the volumetric strain $\\epsilon_{kk}$ by $\\sigma_m = \\kappa \\epsilon_{kk}$. Taking the trace of the constitutive equation:\n$$\n\\sigma_{kk} = \\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22} + \\sigma_{33} = \\sum_{i} \\left( \\lambda \\epsilon_{ll} \\delta_{ii} + 2\\mu \\epsilon_{ii} \\right)\n$$\nSince $\\sum_i \\delta_{ii} = 3$ and $\\sum_i \\epsilon_{ii} = \\epsilon_{kk}$, we get:\n$$\n\\sigma_{kk} = 3\\lambda \\epsilon_{kk} + 2\\mu \\epsilon_{kk} = (3\\lambda + 2\\mu)\\epsilon_{kk}\n$$\nTherefore, the bulk modulus is:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{\\sigma_m}{\\epsilon_{kk}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{kk}/3}{\\epsilon_{kk}} = \\frac{3\\lambda + 2\\mu}{3}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ in terms of $E$ and $\\nu$:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( 3 \\frac{E\\nu}{(1 + \\nu)(1 - 2\\nu)} + 2 \\frac{E}{2(1 + \\nu)} \\right) = \\frac{E}{3(1 + \\nu)} \\left( \\frac{3\\nu}{1 - 2\\nu} + 1 \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{E}{3(1 + \\nu)} \\left( \\frac{3\\nu + 1 - 2\\nu}{1 - 2\\nu} \\right) = \\frac{E}{3(1 + \\nu)} \\left( \\frac{1 + \\nu}{1 - 2\\nu} \\right) = \\frac{E}{3(1 - 2\\nu)}\n$$\nThe derivations for $\\lambda$, $\\mu$, and $\\kappa$ are now complete.\n\n**Part 2: Mechanical Interpretation in 2D**\n\nWe now analyze the roles of these constants under specific $2$D loading conditions, distinguishing between plane strain and plane stress.\n\n**Role of $\\mu$ (Shear Modulus) under Pure In-plane Shear**\nConsider a state of pure shear stress in the $x_1$-$x_2$ plane, where $\\sigma_{12} = \\tau$ is the only non-zero stress component. From the constitutive relation $\\sigma_{ij} = \\lambda \\epsilon_{kk} \\delta_{ij} + 2\\mu \\epsilon_{ij}$, we have:\n$$\n\\sigma_{12} = \\tau = 2\\mu \\epsilon_{12}\n$$\nThis relation holds directly. If we enforce $\\sigma_{11} = \\sigma_{22} = 0$, the equations $\\lambda\\epsilon_{kk} + 2\\mu\\epsilon_{11} = 0$ and $\\lambda\\epsilon_{kk} + 2\\mu\\epsilon_{22} = 0$ imply $\\epsilon_{11}=\\epsilon_{22}$. A full analysis shows that for both plane strain ($\\epsilon_{3j}=0$) and plane stress ($\\sigma_{3j}=0$) conditions, an imposed state of pure in-plane shear stress ($\\sigma_{11}=\\sigma_{22}=0, \\sigma_{12}=\\tau$) results in a state of pure shear strain ($\\epsilon_{11}=\\epsilon_{22}=0, \\epsilon_{12}=\\tau/(2\\mu)$) and no volume change ($\\epsilon_{kk}=0$).\nThus, the interpretation of $\\mu$ is unambiguous and independent of the $2$D assumption: **$\\mu$ is the material's resistance to isochoric (volume-preserving) change in shape (shear distortion).**\n\n**Roles of $\\lambda$ and $\\kappa$ under In-plane Hydrostatic Loading**\nConsider an in-plane hydrostatic stress state: $\\sigma_{11} = \\sigma_{22} = \\sigma_H$, $\\sigma_{12}=0$. We define the in-plane mean stress as $\\sigma_m^{(2D)} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sigma_{11}+\\sigma_{22}) = \\sigma_H$ and the in-plane areal strain as $\\epsilon_A = \\epsilon_{11}+\\epsilon_{22}$. The in-plane areal bulk modulus is $\\kappa^{(2D)} = \\sigma_m^{(2D)}/\\epsilon_A$.\n\n**Case I: Plane Strain ($\\epsilon_{z \\alpha} = 0$)**\nThe condition $\\epsilon_{33}=0$ simplifies the constitutive equations for in-plane components to:\n$$\n\\sigma_{11} = \\lambda(\\epsilon_{11}+\\epsilon_{22}) + 2\\mu\\epsilon_{11}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{22} = \\lambda(\\epsilon_{11}+\\epsilon_{22}) + 2\\mu\\epsilon_{22}\n$$\nSetting $\\sigma_{11}=\\sigma_{22}=\\sigma_H$ requires $\\epsilon_{11}=\\epsilon_{22}$. So, $\\epsilon_A = 2\\epsilon_{11}$.\nThe stress becomes $\\sigma_H = \\lambda(2\\epsilon_{11}) + 2\\mu\\epsilon_{11} = (2\\lambda+2\\mu)\\epsilon_{11}$.\nRelating $\\sigma_H$ to the areal strain $\\epsilon_A = 2\\epsilon_{11}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_H = (\\lambda+\\mu)\\epsilon_A\n$$\nTherefore, the in-plane areal bulk modulus for plane strain is $\\kappa^{(2D)}_{\\text{strain}} = \\lambda + \\mu$. The combination $\\lambda+\\mu$ represents the resistance to in-plane area change under this constraint.\nFurthermore, the constraint $\\epsilon_{33}=0$ induces an out-of-plane stress:\n$$\n\\sigma_{33} = \\lambda(\\epsilon_{11}+\\epsilon_{22}) = \\lambda\\epsilon_A\n$$\nHere, **$\\lambda$ is the parameter that quantifies the normal stress generated perpendicular to a plane of expansion or contraction when that plane is prevented from deforming in the normal direction.** The bulk modulus **$\\kappa$ still governs the overall volume change response**, since the total mean stress is $\\sigma_m = \\frac{1}{3}(2\\sigma_H+\\sigma_{33}) = \\frac{1}{3}(2(\\lambda+\\mu)\\epsilon_A + \\lambda\\epsilon_A) = \\frac{3\\lambda+2\\mu}{3}\\epsilon_A = \\kappa\\epsilon_A$ (as $\\epsilon_{kk}=\\epsilon_A$).\n\n**Case II: Plane Stress ($\\sigma_{z \\alpha} = 0$)**\nThe condition $\\sigma_{33} = 0$ implies $\\lambda\\epsilon_{kk} + 2\\mu\\epsilon_{33}=0$, so $\\epsilon_{33} = -\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\mu}\\epsilon_{kk}$. This shows that in-plane deformation is coupled to out-of-plane deformation.\nUsing the inverted constitutive relations, $\\epsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1}{E}((1+\\nu)\\sigma_{ij} - \\nu\\sigma_{kk}\\delta_{ij})$, with $\\sigma_{11}=\\sigma_{22}=\\sigma_H$ and $\\sigma_{33}=0$, gives $\\sigma_{kk} = 2\\sigma_H$.\n$$\n\\epsilon_{11} = \\frac{1}{E}((1+\\nu)\\sigma_H - \\nu(2\\sigma_H)) = \\frac{\\sigma_H}{E}(1+\\nu-2\\nu) = \\frac{\\sigma_H}{E}(1-\\nu)\n$$\nSymmetry requires $\\epsilon_{11}=\\epsilon_{22}$. The areal strain is $\\epsilon_A = \\epsilon_{11}+\\epsilon_{22} = \\frac{2\\sigma_H}{E}(1-\\nu)$.\nThe in-plane areal bulk modulus for plane stress is:\n$$\n\\kappa^{(2D)}_{\\text{stress}} = \\frac{\\sigma_H}{\\epsilon_A} = \\frac{E}{2(1-\\nu)}\n$$\nThis can be expressed in terms of Lamé constants as $\\kappa^{(2D)}_{\\text{stress}} = \\frac{\\mu(3\\lambda+2\\mu)}{\\lambda+2\\mu}$.\nIn this case, the interpretation is less direct. The plane stress condition allows the body to deform freely out-of-plane ($\\epsilon_{33}=-\\frac{\\nu}{E}(\\sigma_{11}+\\sigma_{22}) = -\\frac{2\\nu\\sigma_H}{E} \\neq 0$). **$\\lambda$ acts as a coupling parameter**, relating the volumetric strain to the out-of-plane strain, thereby affecting the overall in-plane stiffness. The resistance to volume change, described by **$\\kappa = \\sigma_m / \\epsilon_{kk}$**, remains valid, but the total volume change $\\epsilon_{kk} = \\epsilon_A + \\epsilon_{33}$ is a combination of in-plane and out-of-plane effects.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{E\\nu}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} & \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)} & \\frac{E}{3(1-2\\nu)}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2889767"}, {"introduction": "For a given strain field to be physically possible, it must be derivable from a continuous displacement field, a condition which is not guaranteed for an arbitrary field.

They must satisfy certain differential constraints known as the Saint-Venant compatibility conditions. The existence of such a displacement field is guaranteed in a simply connected domain if and only if these conditions are met.\n\nWe begin with the definitions of the infinitesimal strain components in two dimensions, given a displacement field with components $u_x(x,y)$ and $u_y(x,y)$:\n$$ \\epsilon_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} \\quad (1) $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y} \\quad (2) $$\n$$ 2\\epsilon_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} \\quad (3) $$\nHere, we use the engineering definition of shear strain, $\\gamma_{xy} = 2\\epsilon_{xy}$.\n\nTo derive the compatibility condition, we must eliminate the displacement components $u_x$ and $u_y$ from these three equations.
