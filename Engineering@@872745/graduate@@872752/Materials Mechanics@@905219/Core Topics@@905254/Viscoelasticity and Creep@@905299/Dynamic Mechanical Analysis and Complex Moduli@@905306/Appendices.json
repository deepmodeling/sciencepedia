A valid protocol must be based on first principles and systematically decouple the effects of instrument-side variables from material-side field variables.\n\nThe fundamental relationships for parallel-plate rheometry are key. Let the plate radius be $R$ and the gap between the plates be $h$. The measured instrument variables are the angular displacement amplitude, $\\theta_0$, and the torque amplitude, $M_0$. The material field variables, which are not uniform in this geometry, are the shear strain, $\\gamma$, and the shear stress, $\\tau$. The values are typically reported at the rim of the plate ($r=R$), where they are maximum.\n\nThe rim strain amplitude, $\\gamma_0$, is related to the angular displacement amplitude $\\theta_0$ by:\n$$ \\gamma_0 = \\frac{R \\theta_0}{h} $$\nThe rim stress amplitude, $\\tau_0$, is related to the torque amplitude $M_0$ by:\n$$ \\tau_0 = \\frac{2 M_0}{\\pi R^3} $$\nNote that $\\tau_0$ is proportional to $M_0$ with a constant of proportionality that is independent of the gap, $h$. In contrast, $\\gamma_0$ is proportional to $\\theta_0$ but also inversely proportional to $h$. This dependence on $h$ is the critical feature that can be exploited to distinguish certain sources of nonlinearity.\n\nMaterial nonlinearity is, by definition, a phenomenon that occurs when the material response ceases to be linear at a critical value of a field variable, such as a critical strain $\\gamma_c$ or a critical stress $\\tau_c$.\nInstrument nonlinearity originates from the measurement system itself, for example, when the angular displacement $\\theta_0$ or the torque $M_0$ exceeds the linear operating range of the angle encoder or the torque transducer, respectively.\n\nA robust protocol must be able to distinguish between the following cases:\n1.  Material nonlinearity driven by strain ($\\gamma_0$) versus instrument nonlinearity driven by angular displacement ($\\theta_0$).\n2.  Material nonlinearity driven by stress ($\\tau_0$) versus instrument nonlinearity driven by torque ($M_0$).\n\nBy varying the gap $h$, we can decouple the first pair of variables. If we conduct an experiment at a constant strain amplitude $\\gamma_0$, the required angular displacement $\\theta_0 = \\gamma_0 h / R$ will be different for different gaps. Conversely, at a constant angular displacement $\\theta_0$, the resulting strain on the material $\\gamma_0 = R \\theta_0 / h$ will be different. Therefore, if the onset of nonlinearity (e.g., measured by the appearance of higher harmonics or amplitude-dependence of $G^*$) always occurs at the same value of $\\gamma_0$ regardless of $h$, the nonlinearity is material strain-induced. If it always occurs at the same value of $\\theta_0$ regardless of $h$, it is due to the instrument's angle encoder.\n\nFor the second pair, varying $h$ is not sufficient because the relationship $\\tau_0 \\propto M_0$ is independent of $h$. This is where the provided reference material becomes essential. The reference material is known to be linear. Therefore, any nonlinearity observed when testing this material *must* originate from the instrument. By testing the reference material, we can map the instrument's linear operating window in terms of its own variables, $\\theta_0$ and $M_0$.\n\nThe best protocol will, therefore, combine the use of the reference material with experiments at varying gaps to first characterize the instrument's performance and then, using this knowledge, characterize the unknown material.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option:\n\n**A.

It fails to use the provided experimental tools (varying gap, reference material) to verify the source of nonlinearity. Relying on manufacturer specifications without independent verification is poor practice, as instrument performance can change over time. By using a single fixed gap, it is impossible to decouple the contributions of $\\gamma_0$ from $\\theta_0$, as they increase proportionally. Any observed nonlinearity could be from either the material or the instrument.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Perform identical strain-amplitude sweeps on the reference material and the test material at the same $h$ and $\\omega$. If the onset of amplitude dependence of $G^{*}(\\omega)$ occurs at the same strain amplitude in both materials, conclude that the instrument is responsible; otherwise, attribute nonlinearity to the test material.**\n\nThis protocol uses the reference material but its logic is flawed and incomplete. It considers only one fixed gap, $h$. The conclusion is only valid if the instrument nonlinearity is angle-dependent. In that case, a critical angle $\\theta_c$ corresponds to a critical strain $\\gamma_c = R \\theta_c/h$, which would be the same for both materials. However, if the instrument nonlinearity is torque-dependent (occurs at a critical torque $M_c$), this corresponds to a critical stress $\\tau_c \\propto M_c$. The onset strain would then be $\\gamma_0 = \\tau_c / |G^*|$. Since the test material and reference material may have different moduli ($|G^*_{test}| \\neq |G^*_{ref}|$), the onset of nonlinearity would occur at different strain amplitudes, leading to the incorrect conclusion that the nonlinearity is material-driven.

Then perform a single amplitude sweep at one temperature and infer whether nonlinearity is material- or instrument-driven by checking whether the amplitude dependence matches the shift factors from time–temperature superposition.**\n\nThis approach is fundamentally flawed as a primary validation method. It relies on a theoretical model (such as the Cox-Merz rule or similar relations) that connects linear viscoelastic data to nonlinear behavior. This is a model-based *interpretation* of data, not a direct *verification* of the measurement's validity. This method cannot detect instrument nonlinearity if it occurs. It assumes from the outset that any observed nonlinearity is from the material and then tries to model it. It fails to address the core question of distinguishing the source of the signal.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Run “empty” amplitude sweeps (no sample) to quantify instrument friction and inertia; subtract these from the measured response during a single amplitude sweep on the test material to isolate material nonlinearity, assuming the subtraction also removes any instrument nonlinearity.**\n\nThis describes a standard correction for raw data, but it misrepresents its capabilities. Corrections for instrument inertia and friction are typically applied to remove linear, parasitic signals from the measurement. However, the type of nonlinearity discussed—from transducer or encoder limits—is not a simple additive artifact that can be measured in an empty test and subtracted. A nonlinear transducer response is a distortion of the signal itself, not an offset. The assumption that this subtraction \"removes any instrument nonlinearity\" is fundamentally incorrect.

The stress in a linear viscoelastic material at time $t$ cannot depend on strains at future times $t' > t$. This causality requirement on the time-domain response function (e.g., relaxation modulus $G(t)$) implies that its Fourier transform, the complex modulus $E^{\\ast}(\\tilde{\\omega})$, is an analytic function in the upper half of the complex frequency plane $\\tilde{\\omega} = \\omega + \\mathrm{i}\\gamma$. This analyticity leads directly to the Kramers-Kronig (KK) relations.\n\nFor a physical response function, where the time-domain impulse response is real, the complex modulus exhibits Hermitian symmetry: $E^{\\ast}(-\\omega) = \\overline{E^{\\ast}(\\omega)}$. This implies that $E'(\\omega)$ is an even function, $E'(-\\omega) = E'(\\omega)$, and $E''(\\omega)$ is an odd function, $E''(-\\omega) = -E''(\\omega)$. The second law of thermodynamics requires that energy is dissipated in a cyclic deformation, so $E''(\\omega) \\ge 0$ for $\\omega > 0$.\n\nThe standard form of the KK relation connecting $E'(\\omega)$ to $E''(\\omega)$ is given by a principal value integral:\n$$ E'(\\omega) - C = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\mathcal{P} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{E''(x)}{x - \\omega} dx $$\nThe constant $C$ is typically related to the high-frequency limit, $C = E'(\\infty)$.

A scientifically sound procedure must address this. The integral must be split:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} = \\int_{0}^{\\omega_{\\min}} + \\int_{\\omega_{\\min}}^{\\omega_{\\max}} + \\int_{\\omega_{\\max}}^{\\infty} $$\nThe low-frequency ($0 \\to \\omega_{\\min}$) and high-frequency ($\\omega_{\\max} \\to \\infty$) \"tails\" must be constructed using physically-based extrapolations. For instance, at low frequencies, a solid that exhibits terminal flow (viscous liquid behavior) has $E''(\\omega) \\propto \\omega$, while a cross-linked solid has $E''(\\omega) \\propto \\omega^n$ with $n>1$. At high frequencies, $E''(\\omega)$ typically exhibits power-law decay.\n\nFurthermore, numerically evaluating this transform, especially via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) methods which compute the Hilbert transform, is sensitive to discontinuities. The full spectrum, composed of the extrapolated tails and the experimental data, must be a smooth function. Even then, truncating the infinite integral at finite computational bounds introduces spectral leakage. This is controlled by multiplying the full-band $E''(\\omega)$ by a smooth windowing (or tapering) function that gradually goes to zero at the bounds.\n\nFinally, the integral only determines $E'(\\omega)$ up to an arbitrary additive constant $C$. This constant must be determined from independent information, such as a known value of $E'$ at a specific frequency, or by using a a singly subtracted form of the KK relation which is often numerically more stable.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A.** This option correctly outlines all necessary steps.

It correctly specifies the need to splice these tails smoothly. It addresses the numerical artifact of spectral leakage by recommending a smooth tapering window. It correctly formulates the computation as a numerically regularized Hilbert transform. Crucially, it correctly states that the result is obtained only up to an additive constant and lists the valid, standard methods for determining this constant (anchoring to a known value, using known physical limits like $E_0$ or $E_{\\infty}$, or using a subtracted KK form). Finally, it includes the essential step of validating the result. This procedure is comprehensive and scientifically rigorous. **Correct**.\n\n**B.** This option is fundamentally flawed. Zero-padding $E''(\\omega)$ is physically incorrect; it implies the material has zero loss outside the measurement window, creating artificial discontinuities that catastrophically corrupt the Hilbert transform. Treating $E''(\\omega)$ as an even function violates the underlying physics of causality, which demands it be odd. Performing the transform without tapering on a signal with sharp cutoffs is numerically unsound. Claiming the KK relation fixes the absolute level is a severe misunderstanding of the mathematics; an undetermined additive constant is fundamental to the standard form of the transform. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C.** This option proposes a non-standard and problematic method. Fitting a high-degree polynomial to logarithmic data is prone to instability and overfitting. Using local slope approximations ($d(\\log E'')/d(\\log \\omega)$) is not a rigorous application of the KK integral transform but rather a rough approximation valid only under specific conditions. The combination of vague steps like \"heavy smoothing\" and \"zero-padding\" does not constitute a robust procedure. Heavy smoothing can distort the true signal, and zero-padding is, as discussed, incorrect without physical extrapolation. This method is neither sound nor the best practice. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.** This option is based on a misunderstanding of the Fourier transform and its relation to causality. One cannot obtain the time-domain response function $G(t)$ by taking the inverse Fourier transform of only the imaginary part $E''(\\omega)$ of the complex modulus. The resulting time-domain function has no direct physical meaning and is not the causal response. Therefore, the subsequent step of truncating this erroneous function for $t<0$ is meaningless. The claim that this procedure circumvents the need for extrapolation is false; the information missing from the unmeasured frequency bands is simply ignored, leading to a severely distorted result. This approach fails at the most basic conceptual level. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2880035"}]}
