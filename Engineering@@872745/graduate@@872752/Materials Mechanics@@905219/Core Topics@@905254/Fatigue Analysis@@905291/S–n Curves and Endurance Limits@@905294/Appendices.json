Two common conventions exist for reporting life: cycles to failure, denoted by $N_f$, and stress reversals to failure, denoted by $2N_f$. A mixed dataset was compiled from two laboratories, one reporting life in cycles and the other in reversals. The dataset contains three tension–compression, fully reversed ($R=-1$) constant-amplitude tests with the following pairs of stress amplitude $S_a$ (in $\\mathrm{MPa}$) and reported life values:\n- Test $1$: $S_{a,1} = 10^{2.5}$ at a reported life of $10^{4}$.\n- Test $2$: $S_{a,2} = 10^{2.4}$ at a reported life of $10^{5}$.\n- Test $3$: $S_{a,3} = 10^{2.3}$ at a reported life of $2 \\times 10^{6}$.\n\nIt is subsequently discovered that Laboratory B reported life in stress reversals for Test $3$ but recorded the number directly without indicating the convention.

The Basquin relation is a standard, empirically validated model for high-cycle fatigue of metals. The distinction between cycles and reversals is a common convention in the field of fatigue analysis. The given stress and life values are physically plausible for a low-alloy steel. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and a clearly defined mathematical procedure (OLS on log-transformed data) to arrive at a unique solution. The problem statement is objective and uses precise, unambiguous terminology. It does not violate any fundamental principles of mechanics, materials science, or statistics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe Basquin relation is given by $S_a = A N_f^b$. To perform a linear regression, we take the base-$10$ logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\log_{10}(S_a) = \\log_{10}(A N_f^b) = \\log_{10}(A) + b \\log_{10}(N_f) $$\nThis equation is of the form $Y = C + bX$, where the dependent variable is $Y = \\log_{10}(S_a)$, the independent variable is $X = \\log_{10}(N_f)$, the intercept is $C = \\log_{10}(A)$, and the slope is the fatigue strength exponent $b$.\n\nFor a set of $n$ data points $(X_i, Y_i)$, the slope $b$ from an ordinary least-squares regression is calculated as:\n$$ b = \\frac{n \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i Y_i - \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\right) \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i\\right)}{n \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i^2 - \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\right)^2} $$\n\n**Task 1: Determination of $b_{\\text{mixed}}$**\n\nFirst, we analyze the mixed, uncorrected dataset. Let us transform the given data into $(X, Y)$ coordinates.\n- Test $1$: $Y_1 = \\log_{10}(S_{a,1}) = \\log_{10}(10^{2.5}) = 2.5$. The life is reported as $10^4$. Assuming it is in cycles, $X_1 = \\log_{10}(10^4) = 4$.\n- Test $2$: $Y_2 = \\log_{10}(S_{a,2}) = \\log_{10}(10^{2.4}) = 2.4$. The life is reported as $10^5$. Assuming it is in cycles, $X_2 = \\log_{10}(10^5) = 5$.\n- Test $3$: $Y_3 = \\log_{10}(S_{a,3}) = \\log_{10}(10^{2.3}) = 2.3$. The life is reported as $2 \\times 10^6$. In this mixed dataset, we use this value directly: $X_3 = \\log_{10}(2 \\times 10^6) = \\log_{10}(2) + \\log_{10}(10^6) = 6 + \\log_{10}(2)$.\n\nThe dataset is: $(4, 2.5)$, $(5, 2.4)$, $(6+\\log_{10}(2), 2.3)$.\nWe have $n=3$. Let us calculate the required sums:\n- $\\sum X_i = 4 + 5 + (6 + \\log_{10}(2)) = 15 + \\log_{10}(2)$.\n- $\\sum Y_i = 2.5 + 2.4 + 2.3 = 7.2$.\n- $\\sum X_i Y_i = (4)(2.5) + (5)(2.4) + (6 + \\log_{10}(2))(2.3) = 10 + 12 + 13.8 + 2.3 \\log_{10}(2) = 35.8 + 2.3 \\log_{10}(2)$.\n- $\\sum X_i^2 = 4^2 + 5^2 + (6 + \\log_{10}(2))^2 = 16 + 25 + (36 + 12 \\log_{10}(2) + (\\log_{10}(2))^2) = 77 + 12 \\log_{10}(2) + (\\log_{10}(2))^2$.\n\nSubstitute these into the slope formula:\n$$ b_{\\text{mixed}} = \\frac{3(35.8 + 2.3 \\log_{10}(2)) - (15 + \\log_{10}(2))(7.2)}{3(77 + 12 \\log_{10}(2) + (\\log_{10}(2))^2) - (15 + \\log_{10}(2))^2} $$\n$$ b_{\\text{mixed}} = \\frac{107.4 + 6.9 \\log_{10}(2) - 108 - 7.2 \\log_{10}(2)}{231 + 36 \\log_{10}(2) + 3(\\log_{10}(2))^2 - (225 + 30 \\log_{10}(2) + (\\log_{10}(2))^2)} $$\n$$ b_{\\text{mixed}} = \\frac{-0.6 - 0.3 \\log_{10}(2)}{6 + 6 \\log_{10}(2) + 2(\\log_{10}(2))^2} $$\nUsing the approximation $\\log_{10}(2) \\approx 0.30103$:\n$$ b_{\\text{mixed}} \\approx \\frac{-0.6 - 0.3(0.30103)}{6 + 6(0.30103) + 2(0.30103)^2} = \\frac{-0.690309}{6 + 1.80618 + 0.181238} = \\frac{-0.690309}{7.987418} \\approx -0.086424 $$\n\n**Task 2: Determination of $b_{\\text{corr}}$**\n\nNext, we analyze the corrected dataset where the life for Test $3$ is properly converted to cycles, $N_{f,3} = 10^6$.\nThe transformed data points are:\n- Test $1$: $(X_1, Y_1) = (4, 2.5)$.\n- Test $2$: $(X_2, Y_2) = (5, 2.4)$.\n- Test $3$ (corrected): $(X_3, Y_3) = (\\log_{10}(10^6), 2.3) = (6, 2.3)$.\n\nThe points are $(4, 2.5)$, $(5, 2.4)$, $(6, 2.3)$.\nWe observe that these points are perfectly collinear. For any two points, the slope $\\frac{\\Delta Y}{\\Delta X}$ is constant:\n- Slope using points $1$ and $2$: $\\frac{2.4 - 2.5}{5 - 4} = \\frac{-0.1}{1} = -0.1$.\n- Slope using points $2$ and $3$: $\\frac{2.3 - 2.4}{6 - 5} = \\frac{-0.1}{1} = -0.1$.\nFor perfectly collinear data, the OLS regression line passes through all points, and its slope is simply the slope of the line.\nTherefore, $b_{\\text{corr}} = -0.1$.\nWe can verify this with the OLS formula.\n- $\\sum X_i = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15$.\n- $\\sum Y_i = 2.5 + 2.4 + 2.3 = 7.2$.\n- $\\sum X_i Y_i = (4)(2.5) + (5)(2.4) + (6)(2.3) = 10 + 12 + 13.8 = 35.8$.\n- $\\sum X_i^2 = 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 = 16 + 25 + 36 = 77$.\n$$ b_{\\text{corr}} = \\frac{3(35.8) - (15)(7.2)}{3(77) - (15)^2} = \\frac{107.4 - 108}{231 - 225} = \\frac{-0.6}{6} = -0.1 $$\nThe calculation is confirmed.\n\n**Task 3: Explanation of Convention-Mixing Bias**\n\nThe relationship between cycles to failure, $N_f$, and reversals to failure, $N_r$, is $N_r = 2 N_f$.\nConsider two representations of the Basquin law, one based on cycles and another on reversals:\n1. Cycles: $S_a = A N_f^b$\n2. Reversals: $S_a = A' N_r^{b'}$\n\nWe can relate these by substituting $N_r = 2 N_f$ into the second equation: $S_a = A'(2 N_f)^{b'} = A'(2^{b'})N_f^{b'}$.\nFor this to be consistent with the first equation, it must be that $b = b'$ and $A = A' 2^{b'}$. This means the fatigue strength exponent, $b$, is independent of whether life is expressed in cycles or reversals, provided the convention is applied consistently to all data. The fatigue strength coefficient, $A$, however, does depend on the convention.\n\nIn the log-transformed space:\n1. Cycles: $\\log_{10}(S_a) = \\log_{10}(A) + b \\log_{10}(N_f)$.\n2. Reversals: $\\log_{10}(S_a) = \\log_{10}(A') + b' \\log_{10}(N_r)$.\nUsing $\\log_{10}(N_r) = \\log_{10}(2 N_f) = \\log_{10}(2) + \\log_{10}(N_f)$, the second equation becomes:\n$\\log_{10}(S_a) = \\log_{10}(A') + b'(\\log_{10}(2) + \\log_{10}(N_f)) = [\\log_{10}(A') + b' \\log_{10}(2)] + b' \\log_{10}(N_f)$.\nAgain, by comparison, we find $b=b'$ and $\\log_{10}(A) = \\log_{10}(A') + b' \\log_{10}(2)$.\n\nThis analysis shows that changing the life convention from cycles to reversals for all data points corresponds to a constant horizontal shift of the entire dataset on a log-log plot. The independent variable $\\log_{10}(N_f)$ is replaced by $\\log_{10}(N_f) + \\log_{10}(2)$. Such a uniform translation of the independent variable does not change the slope of the best-fit line in a linear regression.\n\nThe problem arises when conventions are **mixed**. In the given scenario, the first two data points use $X = \\log_{10}(N_f)$, but the third point erroneously uses $X = \\log_{10}(N_r) = \\log_{10}(2 N_f)$. This is not a uniform shift. This selective misrepresentation of one data point moves it horizontally relative to the others. The correct data points $(4, 2.5)$, $(5, 2.4)$, $(6, 2.3)$ lie on a straight line with slope $b_{\\text{corr}} = -0.1$. The mixed dataset uses the points $(4, 2.5)$, $(5, 2.4)$, and $(6+\\log_{10}(2), 2.3)$. Point $3$ has been shifted to the right by $\\log_{10}(2)$ while points $1$ and $2$ remain fixed.\nTo fit a line through these three non-collinear points, the OLS procedure minimizes the sum of squared vertical errors. Since the rightmost point ($3$) has been shifted further to the right horizontally without changing its vertical position, the resulting best-fit line must become \"flatter\" to accommodate it. A flatter slope means its value is less negative, i.e., closer to zero. Our calculations confirm this: $b_{\\text{mixed}} \\approx -0.0864$ which is indeed less negative than $b_{\\text{corr}} = -0.1$. This systematic error, or bias, in the slope estimate is a direct consequence of the inconsistent data representation.\n\n**Task 4: Report Final Answer**\n\nThe corrected slope is $b_{\\text{corr}} = -0.1$.

The data provided are physically realistic for a machined steel. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and I shall proceed with its solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of a life extension factor, $\\Lambda$, which is defined as the ratio of fatigue life under a non-zero mean stress to the fatigue life under zero mean stress for the same stress amplitude. The solution involves combining the Basquin law for the stress-life ($S–N$) relationship with the Goodman mean stress correction.\n\nFirst, we state the Basquin law, which describes the high-cycle fatigue behavior for fully reversed loading (mean stress $\\sigma_m=0$). Let $\\sigma_{ar}$ be the fully reversed stress amplitude that results in a fatigue life of $N$ cycles. The relationship is a power law:\n$$ \\sigma_{ar} = C N^b $$\nwhere $C$ is a material constant and $b$ is the Basquin exponent, also known as the fatigue strength exponent.\n\nNext, we introduce the Goodman mean stress correction to account for the effect of a non-zero mean stress $\\sigma_m$. For a finite life $N$, the Goodman relation connects the applied stress amplitude $\\sigma_a$ and mean stress $\\sigma_m$ to the equivalent fully reversed stress amplitude $\\sigma_{ar}$ that would produce the same life $N$. The linear Goodman relation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_a}{\\sigma_{ar}} + \\frac{\\sigma_m}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{UTS}}} = 1 $$\nwhere $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{UTS}}$ is the ultimate tensile strength of the material. This equation allows us to find the fully reversed stress amplitude $\\sigma_{ar}$ that is life-equivalent to the applied stress state $(\\sigma_a, \\sigma_m)$.\n\nWe can solve this equation for $\\sigma_{ar}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_a}{\\sigma_{ar}} = 1 - \\frac{\\sigma_m}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{UTS}}} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{ar} = \\frac{\\sigma_a}{1 - \\frac{\\sigma_m}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{UTS}}}} = \\sigma_a \\left(1 - \\frac{\\sigma_m}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{UTS}}}\\right)^{-1} $$\nThis expression for $\\sigma_{ar}$ can now be substituted into the Basquin law to find the fatigue life $N$ for the given stress state $(\\sigma_a, \\sigma_m)$. First, we solve the Basquin law for $N$:\n$$ N = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{ar}}{C}\\right)^{1/b} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\sigma_{ar}$:\n$$ N(\\sigma_a, \\sigma_m) = \\left[ \\frac{1}{C} \\frac{\\sigma_a}{1 - \\frac{\\sigma_m}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{UTS}}}} \\right]^{1/b} $$\nThis equation gives the fatigue life as a function of the applied stress amplitude and mean stress.\n\nThe life extension factor $\\Lambda$ is defined as the ratio of the life with the given compressive mean stress, which we denote as $N(\\sigma_m)$, to the life with zero mean stress, $N(\\sigma_m=0)$, for the same stress amplitude $\\sigma_a$.\nThe life with the given mean stress is given by the expression derived above:\n$$ N(\\sigma_m) = \\left[ \\frac{\\sigma_a}{C\\left(1 - \\frac{\\sigma_m}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{UTS}}}\\right)} \\right]^{1/b} $$\nThe life at zero mean stress is found by setting $\\sigma_m=0$ in the general life equation:\n$$ N(\\sigma_m=0) = \\left[ \\frac{\\sigma_a}{C\\left(1 - \\frac{0}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{UTS}}}\\right)} \\right]^{1/b} = \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_a}{C} \\right)^{1/b} $$\nNow, we form the ratio $\\Lambda$:\n$$ \\Lambda = \\frac{N(\\sigma_m)}{N(\\sigma_m=0)} = \\frac{\\left[ \\frac{\\sigma_a}{C\\left(1 - \\frac{\\sigma_m}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{UTS}}}\\right)} \\right]^{1/b}}{\\left( \\frac{\\sigma_a}{C} \\right)^{1/b} $$\nWe can simplify this expression by combining the terms inside the exponent:\n$$ \\Lambda = \\left[ \\frac{\\frac{\\sigma_a}{C\\left(1 - \\frac{\\sigma_m}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{UTS}}}\\right)}}{\\frac{\\sigma_a}{C}} \\right]^{1/b} = \\left[ \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\sigma_m}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{UTS}}}} \\right]^{1/b} $$\nThis simplifies to the final symbolic expression for the life extension factor:\n$$ \\Lambda = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\sigma_m}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{UTS}}}\\right)^{-1/b} $$\nIt is notable that the life extension factor $\\Lambda$ depends only on the mean stress $\\sigma_m$, the ultimate tensile strength $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{UTS}}$, and the Basquin exponent $b$.

In History A, the overload creates a plastic wake and crack closure that reduce the effective post-overload range $\\,\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\,$ during the subsequent low-amplitude block. Because the nominal $\\,\\Delta K_L\\,$ at $\\,a_0\\,$ is only slightly above $\\,\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th,small}}\\,$, this reduction can drop $\\,\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\,$ below threshold and arrest growth over a distance of order $\\,r_p\\,$. Thus, Miner’s linear damage summation based on smooth-specimen S–N data overpredicts damage for History A (i.e., it is conservative).\n\nB. In History B, because the amplitude histogram is the same as in History A, the cumulative damage predicted by Miner’s rule remains valid: the order of application does not matter even for small cracks near threshold.\n\nC. For both histories, since the low-amplitude level produces $\\,\\Delta K_L  \\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th,long}}\\,$, there is no crack propagation at the low level. Therefore, Miner’s rule is exact near the endurance limit if long-crack thresholds are used.\n\nD. If the overload is sufficiently high that its induced $\\,\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\,$ reduction persists over a retardation length comparable to $\\,r_p\\,$, then applying the overload earlier is more effective at retarding or arresting growth because $\\,\\Delta K_L\\,$ for the smaller crack is closer to $\\,\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th,small}}\\,$; the same closure-induced reduction may drop $\\,\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\,$ below threshold early but not late.

It is grounded in the established principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) and fatigue crack growth, specifically addressing the important and non-trivial topic of variable amplitude loading, overload effects (retardation), and the distinction between small-crack and long-crack behavior. All physical quantities and material properties provided ($\\sigma_y$, $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th}}$, $a_0$) are realistic for high-strength steels. The equations for stress intensity factor and plastic zone size are standard approximations in the field. The question asks for a logical deduction based on these principles to evaluate the validity of a simplified engineering model (Miner's rule), which is a common and meaningful task in structural integrity analysis. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution can be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nFirst, we must evaluate the condition for crack growth under the low-amplitude cycles for the initial crack of size $a_0 = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$. The nominal stress intensity factor range, $\\Delta K_L$, is:\n$$ \\Delta K_L = Y\\,\\Delta \\sigma_L\\,\\sqrt{\\pi a_0} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\Delta K_L = (1.12) \\times (220\\,\\mathrm{MPa}) \\times \\sqrt{\\pi \\times (5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m})} $$\n$$ \\Delta K_L = 246.4\\,\\mathrm{MPa} \\times \\sqrt{1.5708 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}} $$\n$$ \\Delta K_L = 246.4\\,\\mathrm{MPa} \\times 0.01253\\,\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 3.09\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}} $$\nThis value must be compared to the given fatigue thresholds:\n- $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th,small}} \\approx 3\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$\n- $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th,long}} \\approx 6\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$\n\nOur calculation shows that $\\Delta K_L  \\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th,small}}$. Therefore, the initial small crack is not dormant; it will propagate under the low-amplitude cyclic loading. However, $\\Delta K_L$ is only marginally above the threshold, implying that the crack growth is in the sensitive near-threshold regime.\nAlso note that $\\Delta K_L  \\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th,long}}$, which means an analysis based solely on long-crack data would incorrectly predict crack arrest.\n\nNow, let us analyze the two load histories.\n\n**History A: Overload First**\nA single overload with $\\sigma_{\\max,\\mathrm{OL}} = 800\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ is applied to the initial crack $a_0$. This generates a large plastic zone ahead of the crack tip. The maximum stress intensity factor during the overload is:\n$$ K_{\\max,\\mathrm{OL}} = Y\\,\\sigma_{\\max,\\mathrm{OL}}\\,\\sqrt{\\pi a_0} = (1.12) \\times (800\\,\\mathrm{MPa}) \\times \\sqrt{\\pi \\times (5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m})} \\approx 11.23\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}} $$\nThe size of the forward plastic zone is estimated as:\n$$ r_p \\approx \\dfrac{1}{2\\pi}\\left(\\dfrac{K_{\\max,\\mathrm{OL}}}{\\sigma_y}\\right)^2 = \\dfrac{1}{2\\pi}\\left(\\dfrac{11.23\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}}{1200\\,\\mathrm{MPa}}\\right)^2 \\approx 1.39 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 13.9\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} $$\nAs stated in the problem, this overload induces a plastic wake and compressive residual stresses that increase crack closure. This reduces the *effective* stress intensity factor range, $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, for the subsequent low-amplitude cycles. The nominal driving force for these cycles is $\\Delta K_L \\approx 3.09\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$, which is barely above the small-crack threshold $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th,small}} \\approx 3\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$. The reduction due to overload-induced closure, $\\Delta K_{cl}$, means $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\Delta K_L - \\Delta K_{cl}$. It is highly probable that this reduction will cause $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ to fall below $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th,small}}$. If $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff}}  \\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th,small}}$, fatigue crack growth will be arrested. This arrest will persist until the crack tip, if it were to grow, exits the overload-affected zone of size $\\mathcal{O}(r_p)$. Since it is arrested, it does not grow. Consequently, History A leads to significant life extension or even quasi-infinite life if the crack is permanently arrested.\n\n**History B: Overload Last**\nThe low-amplitude cycles are applied first. Since $\\Delta K_L  \\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th,small}}$, the crack begins to grow immediately from $a_0$. During the $N_L$ cycles, the crack length $a$ increases, and so does the driving force $\\Delta K_L = Y\\,\\Delta \\sigma_L\\,\\sqrt{\\pi a}$. The lifetime is consumed by this crack propagation. The overload is applied at the end of this period. Its effect is irrelevant to the life already spent. The total life for History B is significantly shorter than for History A.\n\n**Comparison and Miner's Rule**\nThe Palmgren-Miner rule is based on the linear summation of damage fractions, $D = \\sum n_i/N_i$, where the damage caused by a block of cycles is assumed to be independent of its position in the load sequence. For Histories A and B, the load histograms are identical, so Miner's rule predicts identical lifetimes.\nOur physical analysis shows that Life(A)  Life(B). This demonstrates a strong sequence effect that Miner's rule completely fails to capture. The analyst's prediction is therefore incorrect.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In History A, the overload creates a plastic wake and crack closure that reduce the effective post-overload range $\\,\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\,$ during the subsequent low-amplitude block. Because the nominal $\\,\\Delta K_L\\,$ at $\\,a_0\\,$ is only slightly above $\\,\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th,small}}\\,$, this reduction can drop $\\,\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\,$ below threshold and arrest growth over a distance of order $\\,r_p\\,$. Thus, Miner’s linear damage summation based on smooth-specimen S–N data overpredicts damage for History A (i.e., it is conservative).**\nThis statement accurately describes the overload retardation phenomenon. Our calculation confirms that $\\Delta K_L$ is very close to $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th,small}}$, making crack arrest by overload-induced closure highly likely. If the crack is arrested, no damage accumulates, whereas Miner's rule would accumulate damage for every low-amplitude cycle. Thus, Miner's rule predicts a shorter life than reality, meaning it overpredicts the damage. A prediction that is shorter than the actual life is defined as \"conservative\". The statement is entirely consistent with our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. In History B, because the amplitude histogram is the same as in History A, the cumulative damage predicted by Miner’s rule remains valid: the order of application does not matter even for small cracks near threshold.**\nThis statement correctly describes the *prediction* of Miner's rule (sequence independence) but incorrectly claims this prediction is \"valid\" and that the order \"does not matter\". As our analysis showed, the order of application is critically important. History A leads to a much longer life than History B. The core physical reality contradicts the statement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. For both histories, since the low-amplitude level produces $\\,\\Delta K_L  \\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th,long}}\\,$, there is no crack propagation at the low level. Therefore, Miner’s rule is exact near the endurance limit if long-crack thresholds are used.**\nThe premise $\\Delta K_L  \\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th,long}}$ is correct. However, the conclusion \"there is no crack propagation\" is false. The problem explicitly provides a lower threshold for small cracks, $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th,small}}$, and we calculated that $\\Delta K_L  \\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th,small}}$. Therefore, crack propagation does occur. The statement incorrectly ignores the specified small-crack behavior, which is the key to the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. If the overload is sufficiently high that its induced $\\,\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\,$ reduction persists over a retardation length comparable to $\\,r_p\\,$, then applying the overload earlier is more effective at retarding or arresting growth because $\\,\\Delta K_L\\,$ for the smaller crack is closer to $\\,\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th,small}}\\,$; the same closure-induced reduction may drop $\\,\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\,$ below threshold early but not late. Consequently, the sequence “overload first” yields a longer life than “overload last,” contrary to Miner’s sequence-independent prediction.**\nThis statement provides a correct and more general explanation of the sequence effect. The effectiveness of an overload in causing retardation is greatest when the subsequent cyclic loading has a $\\Delta K$ that is close to the threshold. This condition is met for the small initial crack but becomes less true as the crack grows. Therefore, applying the overload early (History A) has a much larger beneficial effect on life than applying it late (History B). This physical sequence-dependence is contrary to Miner's rule. The reasoning and conclusion are sound.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. An overload always accelerates subsequent crack growth because the plastic zone contains tensile residual stresses ahead of the tip; therefore Miner’s linear rule is conservative for both sequences.**\nThis statement is based on a false physical premise. The dominant and most widely documented effect of a single tensile overload in ductile metals is *retardation* of subsequent crack growth, not acceleration. This is due to the compressive residual stress field and resulting crack closure in the wake of the overload plastic zone. While some localized tensile stress exists at the blunted tip, the far-field closure effect controls the behavior. The primary premise is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2915950"}]}
