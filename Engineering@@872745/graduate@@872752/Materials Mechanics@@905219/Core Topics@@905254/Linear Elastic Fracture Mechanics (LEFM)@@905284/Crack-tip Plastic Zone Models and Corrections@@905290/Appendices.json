The energy release rate is defined as the negative rate of change of the total potential energy of the system, $U_{\\Pi}$, with respect to the crack area, $A$.

For a test under constant applied force $P$, the potential of the load is $-Pu$, where $u$ is the load-point displacement. Therefore, $U_{\\Pi} = U_{s} - Pu$.\n\nFor a linear elastic system, the strain energy is given by $U_{s} = \\frac{1}{2}Pu$.

The problem is self-contained, with all necessary data and constraints clearly defined for a unique, verifiable solution. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute three quantities for a series of test cases concerning a center-cracked infinite plate under mode I loading: the Dugdale plastic-zone extension $d$, the Dugdale crack-tip opening displacement $\\delta$, and the Irwin plastic-zone size estimate $r_p^{\\mathrm{Irwin}}$. The plate is considered to be in a state of plane stress. The calculation for each test case, given as ($E, \\nu, a, \\sigma, \\sigma_y$), proceeds through a logical sequence of steps derived from fundamental principles.\n\nStep 1: Computation of the Mode I Stress Intensity Factor, $K_I$.\nFor a through-thickness center crack of total length $2a$, or half-length $a$, in an infinite plate subjected to a remote uniform tensile stress $\\sigma$, the stress intensity factor under mode I loading is given by the fundamental LEFM solution:\n$$K_I = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a}$$\nThis quantity represents the magnitude of the crack-tip stress singularity and is the basis for all subsequent fracture mechanics calculations. It is a function of the applied load and the geometry of the crack.\n\nStep 2: Computation of the Irwin Plastic-Zone Size Estimate, $r_p^{\\mathrm{Irwin}}$.\nIrwin's model provides a first-order correction to LEFM by estimating the extent of the plastic zone ahead of the crack tip. The model uses the LEFM solution for the stress field near the crack tip, $\\sigma_{yy}(r, \\theta=0) \\approx K_I / \\sqrt{2 \\pi r}$, and posits that the plastic zone boundary is located at the radius $r_p$ where this stress equals the material's yield strength, $\\sigma_y$. For plane stress conditions, this yields:\n$$\\sigma_y = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi r_p^{\\mathrm{Irwin}}}}$$\nSolving for the plastic zone size, $r_p^{\\mathrm{Irwin}}$, we obtain:\n$$r_p^{\\mathrm{Irwin}} = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi}\\left(\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_y}\\right)^2$$\nThis estimate is based on the redistribution of stress but does not enforce equilibrium on the modified stress field. It is primarily useful for assessing whether the assumption of small-scale yielding is valid.\n\nStep 3: Computation of the Dugdale Plastic-Zone Extension, $d$.\nThe Dugdale model provides a more physically rigorous picture by idealizing the plastic zone as a thin strip of yielded material ahead of the crack tip. A constant cohesive traction, equal to the yield stress $\\sigma_y$, acts over this strip, opposing the crack opening. The length of this strip, $d$, is determined by the condition that the stress singularity at the tip of the extended crack (physical crack tip + plastic zone) must be zero. The stress intensity factor from the remote stress $\\sigma$ on a crack of effective half-length $(a+d)$ is counteracted by the stress intensity factor from the cohesive tractions $\\sigma_y$ acting over the region from $x=a$ to $x=a+d$. This balance leads to the following exact relationship:\n$$\\frac{\\pi \\sigma}{2 \\sigma_y} = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{a}{a+d}\\right)$$\nThis is equivalent to the form given in the problem statement:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma_y} = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi a}{2(a+d)}\\right)$$\nInverting this equation to solve for the plastic zone extension $d$ gives the required computational formula:\n$$d = a \\left( \\sec\\left(\\frac{\\pi \\sigma}{2 \\sigma_y}\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\nOr, using the provided form which is numerically more convenient:\n$$d = \\frac{\\pi a}{2 \\arccos(\\sigma/\\sigma_y)} - a$$\nThis expression directly gives the length of the yielded strip.\n\nStep 4: Computation of the Dugdale Crack-Tip Opening Displacement, $\\delta$.\nThe crack-tip opening displacement (CTOD), denoted $\\delta$, is the displacement between the crack faces at the location of the original physical crack tip ($x=a$). In the context of the Dugdale model, $\\delta$ can be determined through an energy balance argument using the $J$-integral. For a perfectly plastic material, the work of separation per unit area of crack extension is $J = \\sigma_y \\delta$. Under monotonic loading and small-scale yielding conditions, the $J$-integral is equivalent to the elastic energy release rate, $G$. For plane stress, $G = K_I^2 / E$. Equating these gives:\n$$J = \\sigma_y \\delta = \\frac{K_I^2}{E'}$$\nWhere $E'$ is the effective Young's modulus. For plane stress, as specified, $E' = E$. Therefore, we solve for $\\delta$:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{K_I^2}{E \\sigma_y}$$\nThis provides the opening at the crack tip, a critical parameter for assessing ductile fracture initiation. Note that the provided Poisson's ratio, $\\nu$, is not required for any of these plane stress calculations but would be necessary for plane strain where $E' = E / (1-\\nu^2)$.\n\nThe implementation will apply these four sequential steps to each test case to compute the three specified output quantities: $d$, $\\delta$, and $r_p^{\\mathrm{Irwin}}$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes Dugdale and Irwin plastic zone parameters for a center crack\n    in an infinite plate under plane stress.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case is a tuple: (E, nu, a, sigma, sigma_y) in SI units.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1 (steel-like, moderate load)\n        (2.10e11, 0.30, 1.00e-2, 2.00e8, 4.00e8),\n        # Case 2 (aluminum-like, low load)\n        (7.00e10, 0.33, 5.00e-3, 5.00e7, 3.50e8),\n        # Case 3 (near-yield, larger crack)\n        (2.10e11, 0.30, 2.00e-2, 5.40e8, 6.00e8),\n        # Case 4 (small crack, high strength)\n        (2.00e11, 0.30, 5.00e-4, 1.00e8, 1.00e9),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        E, nu, a, sigma, sigma_y = case\n\n        # 1) Compute the LEFM stress intensity factor K_I\n        K_I = sigma * np.sqrt(np.pi * a)\n\n        # 2) Compute Irwin's plane-stress plastic-zone estimate r_p_Irwin\n        r_p_irwin = (1 / (2 * np.pi)) * (K_I / sigma_y)**2\n\n        # 3) Compute the Dugdale plastic-zone extension d\n        # The condition sigma  sigma_y is guaranteed by the problem statement.\n        # d = a * (sec(pi*sigma / (2*sigma_y)) - 1) is an alternative form.\n        # The form below using arccos is provided in the problem.\n        sigma_ratio = sigma / sigma_y\n        d_dugdale = (np.pi * a) / (2 * np.arccos(sigma_ratio)) - a\n\n        # 4) Compute the Dugdale crack-tip opening displacement delta\n        # For plane stress, E' = E.\n        delta_dugdale = K_I**2 / (E * sigma_y)\n        \n        # Aggregate the results in the specified order: [d, delta, r_p_Irwin]\n        # All results are in meters.\n        results.append([d_dugdale, delta_dugdale, r_p_irwin])\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # Convert the list of lists to the required string representation.\n    output_str = \"[\" + \",\".join([f\"[{d},{delta},{rp}]\" for d, delta, rp in results]) + \"]\"\n    print(output_str)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2874860"}]}
