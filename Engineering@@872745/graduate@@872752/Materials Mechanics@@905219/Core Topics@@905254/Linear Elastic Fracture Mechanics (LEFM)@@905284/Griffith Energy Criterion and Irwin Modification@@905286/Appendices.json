It is scientifically grounded in linear elastic fracture mechanics, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. We shall proceed.\n\nThe problem requires two distinct tasks. First, to derive the relationship between the mode I elastic energy release rate $G$ and the mode I stress-intensity factor $K_I$ under plane strain conditions. Second, to compute a numerical value for $G$ for a specific specimen geometry and loading.\n\nWe begin with the first task. The foundation is Griffith's energy balance criterion, which posits that a crack will extend when the energy released from the elastic body is sufficient to create new crack surfaces. The energy release rate, $G$, is defined as the rate of change of the system's potential energy, $\\Pi$, with respect to the crack area, $A$. For a straight-through crack of length $a$ in a specimen of uniform thickness $B$, the crack area is $A = B a$. Thus,\n$$G = -\\frac{d\\Pi}{dA} = -\\frac{1}{B}\\frac{d\\Pi}{da}$$\nIrwin's great contribution was to show that $G$ can be calculated from the local stress and displacement fields at the crack tip. The energy released during a small crack extension, $\\Delta a$, is equal to the work that must be done to close this newly created crack segment back to its original state. This is the basis of the crack closure integral.\n\nConsider a virtual crack extension of infinitesimal length $\\Delta a$. The work done per unit thickness, $W_{closure}$, to close this extension is found by integrating the product of the stresses that existed on the plane of the crack before extension, $\\sigma_{yy}(r, \\theta=0)$, and the opening displacements of the new crack faces, $u_y(\\Delta a - r, \\theta=\\pi)$. The total work is done over both new crack faces. This work must equal the energy released, $G \\Delta a$.\n$$G \\Delta a = 2 \\int_0^{\\Delta a} \\sigma_{yy}(r, \\theta=0) u_y(\\Delta a - r, \\theta=\\pi) dr$$\nThe factor of $2$ accounts for the two crack surfaces. Here, $r$ is the distance from the original crack tip along the crack line, and $\\Delta a - r$ is the distance from the new crack tip.\n\nFrom linear elastic fracture mechanics, the asymptotic stress field ahead of a mode I crack tip is given by:\n$$\\sigma_{yy}(r, \\theta=0) = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}}$$\nThe asymptotic displacement field for a point on the crack flank $(\\theta=\\pi)$ is needed. The general form for the vertical displacement is:\n$$u_y(r', \\theta) = \\frac{K_I}{2\\mu} \\sqrt{\\frac{r'}{2\\pi}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\left[ \\frac{\\kappa+1}{2} - \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\right]$$\nwhere $r'$ is the radial distance from the current crack-tip, $\\mu$ is the shear modulus, and $\\kappa$ is a material parameter dependent on the stress state. For plane strain, we have:\n$$\\kappa = 3 - 4\\nu \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mu = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}$$\nwhere $E$ is Young's modulus and $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio.

The distance from the new tip is $r' = \\Delta a - r$.\n$$G \\Delta a = 2 \\int_0^{\\Delta a} \\left(\\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{2 K_I (1-\\nu^2)}{E} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Delta a - r}{2\\pi}}\\right) dr$$\n$$G \\Delta a = \\frac{4 K_I^2 (1-\\nu^2)}{2\\pi E} \\int_0^{\\Delta a} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Delta a - r}{r}} dr = \\frac{2 K_I^2 (1-\\nu^2)}{\\pi E} \\int_0^{\\Delta a} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Delta a - r}{r}} dr$$\nTo solve the integral, we make the substitution $r = \\Delta a \\sin^2\\phi$, so $dr = 2\\Delta a \\sin\\phi \\cos\\phi \\, d\\phi$.

It is a standard problem in the field of linear elastic fracture mechanics and is therefore valid for solution.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the specimen thickness requirement for valid plane-strain fracture toughness testing, an explanation of its connection to fundamental energy principles, and a final calculation.\n\nFirst, we will establish the basis for the thickness requirement. The stress field near the tip of a Mode I crack in a linear elastic material is characterized by the stress intensity factor, $K_I$. Along the plane ahead of the crack ($\\theta=0$), the stress component normal to the crack plane, $\\sigma_{yy}$, is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_{yy}(r, \\theta=0) = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}}\n$$\nwhere $r$ is the distance from the crack tip. This equation predicts an unphysical stress singularity at $r=0$. In a real material with a finite yield strength, $\\sigma_Y$, yielding occurs when the local stress reaches this value. A small region of plasticity, known as the plastic zone, forms at the crack tip. A first-order estimate for the size of this plastic zone, $r_p$, can be obtained by finding the distance $r$ at which $\\sigma_{yy}$ equals $\\sigma_Y$:\n$$\n\\sigma_Y = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r_p}} \\implies r_p = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left(\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y}\\right)^2\n$$\nThis is a simplified estimate. Irwin's model, accounting for the stress redistribution caused by yielding, provides a more accurate estimate for the plastic zone size. The size depends critically on the state of stress: plane stress or plane strain.\n\nAt the free surfaces of a specimen of thickness $B$, the stress component normal to the surface, $\\sigma_{zz}$, must be zero, leading to a state of plane stress. In the interior of the specimen, if it is sufficiently thick, the material is constrained in the thickness direction, leading to $\\epsilon_{zz} \\approx 0$, which defines a state of plane strain. The plane-strain condition creates a triaxial stress state that inhibits plastic flow, resulting in a smaller plastic zone compared to the plane-stress condition. The approximate plastic zone sizes, $r_p$, are:\n$$\nr_p^{\\text{plane stress}} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left(\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y}\\right)^2\n$$\n$$\nr_p^{\\text{plane strain}} \\approx \\frac{1}{3\\pi} \\left(\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y}\\right)^2\n$$\nFor a toughness measurement to be a valid plane-strain fracture toughness, $K_{Ic}$, the crack tip must be predominantly under plane-strain conditions. This means the specimen thickness, $B$, must be substantially larger than the extent of the plane-stress plastic zones that develop at the free surfaces. The governing dimension is the size of the larger, plane-stress plastic zone. The requirement is that the thickness $B$ must be much greater than the plastic zone diameter, which is $2r_p$. A conservative condition is thus set for $B$ relative to $r_p^{\\text{plane stress}}$:\n$$\nB \\gg r_p^{\\text{plane stress}}\n$$\nLet us express this as a formal requirement: $B \\ge C_0 \\cdot r_p^{\\text{plane stress}}$, where $C_0$ is a dimensionless factor substantially greater than one. Substituting the expression for the plane-stress plastic zone size and using $K_I = K_{Ic}$ at fracture:\n$$\nB \\ge C_0 \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left(\\frac{K_{Ic}}{\\sigma_Y}\\right)^2\n$$\nCombining the constants $C_0$ and $\\pi$ into a single coefficient $C = C_0 / \\pi$, we arrive at the required form:\n$$\nB \\ge C \\left(\\frac{K_{Ic}}{\\sigma_Y}\\right)^2\n$$\nThe value of the coefficient $C$ is determined empirically to ensure that the measured toughness value is independent of specimen thickness, which is the defining characteristic of a true material property. To justify its order of magnitude, consider that to achieve a dominant plane-strain core, the thickness $B$ should be many times the plastic zone size. If we mandate, for instance, that $B$ be approximately $8$ times the plastic zone radius, $r_p^{\\text{plane stress}}$, then $C_0 \\approx 8$. This leads to $C = 8/\\pi \\approx 2.55$. Experimental validation, as codified in standards such as ASTM E399, has established the value $C=2.5$. This value ensures that the size of the central plane-strain region is large enough that the surface plane-stress effects are negligible, and a state of high triaxiality is maintained.\n\nNext, we connect this to the Griffith energy criterion. The Griffith criterion, for a perfectly brittle material, posits that crack extension occurs when the energy release rate, $G$, equals the critical energy required to create new surfaces, $G_c = 2\\gamma_s$. Irwin extended this to ductile materials by showing that $G$ is related to the stress intensity factor $K$. For Mode I loading, the relations are:\n$$\nG_I = \\frac{K_I^2}{E} \\quad (\\text{plane stress})\n$$\n$$\nG_I = \\frac{K_I^2(1-\\nu^2)}{E} \\quad (\\text{plane strain})\n$$\nwhere $E$ is Young's modulus and $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio. At fracture initiation, $K_I = K_c$ and $G_I = G_c$. The value of $G_c$, and therefore $K_c$, depends on the stress state. Plane strain provides greater constraint against plastic deformation, resulting in a lower energy dissipation and thus a lower toughness value. This minimum, thickness-independent toughness is denoted $K_{Ic}$, the plane-strain fracture toughness. The thickness requirement $B \\ge C(K_{Ic}/\\sigma_Y)^2$ is therefore a geometric constraint that forces the mechanical state at the crack tip into the plane-strain regime. By doing so, it ensures that the measured stress intensity factor at fracture corresponds to the true, minimum critical energy release rate, $G_{Ic} = K_{Ic}^2(1-\\nu^2)/E$, which is a fundamental material property.\n\nFinally, we compute the minimum required thickness, $B_{\\min}$, for the given steel. We use the justified and standardized coefficient $C=2.5$.\nThe given properties are $K_{Ic} = 55\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\sigma_Y = 1.00 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\nThe formula for minimum thickness is:\n$$\nB_{\\min} = C \\left(\\frac{K_{Ic}}{\\sigma_Y}\\right)^2\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\nB_{\\min} = 2.5 \\times \\left(\\frac{55\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}}{1000\\,\\mathrm{MPa}}\\right)^2\n$$\nThe units of the ratio inside the parenthesis are $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$.

Once the Griffith condition $G = R$ (with $R$ the material’s crack resistance) is met, any further increase in $a$ raises $G$, pushing the system farther above the resistance, and thus the crack growth is unstable. In the present finite-width geometry, this tendency intensifies as $\\dfrac{a}{W} \\to 1$, since both $\\sec(\\beta)$ and $\\tan(\\beta)$ diverge as $\\beta \\to \\dfrac{\\pi}{2}$.
