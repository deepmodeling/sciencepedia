It represents a standard application of classical plasticity theory. We shall proceed with its solution.\n\nThe analysis of yielding in ductile metals begins with the decomposition of the Cauchy stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, into its hydrostatic and deviatoric parts. The hydrostatic part represents a state of uniform pressure that causes volume change (dilatation), while the deviatoric part represents the shear components that cause shape change (distortion).\n\nThe mean or hydrostatic stress, $\\sigma_m$, is defined as the average of the principal stresses:\n$$\n\\sigma_m = \\frac{1}{3}(\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2 + \\sigma_3) = \\frac{1}{3}\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})\n$$\nThe hydrostatic stress tensor is then $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_m = \\sigma_m \\mathbf{I}$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor.\n\nThe deviatoric stress tensor, $\\mathbf{s}$, is what remains after subtracting the hydrostatic component from the total stress tensor:\n$$\n\\mathbf{s} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_m\n$$\nIts principal components are $s_1 = \\sigma_1 - \\sigma_m$, $s_2 = \\sigma_2 - \\sigma_m$, and $s_3 = \\sigma_3 - \\sigma_m$. By definition, the trace of the deviatoric stress tensor is zero: $\\text{tr}(\\mathbf{s}) = s_1 + s_2 + s_3 = 0$.\n\nThe fundamental postulate for the yielding of ductile metals, as stated in the problem, is that the onset of plastic flow is independent of the hydrostatic stress component. This is physically motivated by the mechanism of plastic deformation, which is dislocation motion (slip). Slip is driven by shear stress on crystallographic planes and results in a change of shape at nearly constant volume. Hydrostatic pressure, lacking any shear component, does not drive dislocation motion and therefore does not contribute to yielding. Consequently, any valid yield criterion must be a function only of the deviatoric stress tensor, $\\mathbf{s}$, which exclusively governs distortion.\n\nWe verify this for the two classical criteria:\n\n1)  The von Mises yield criterion postulates that yielding occurs when the second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor, $J_2$, reaches a critical value. $J_2$ is defined as:\n    $$\n    J_2 = \\frac{1}{2} s_{ij} s_{ji} = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{tr}(\\mathbf{s}^2) = \\frac{1}{6} \\left[ (\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2)^2 + (\\sigma_2 - \\sigma_3)^2 + (\\sigma_3 - \\sigma_1)^2 \\right]\n    $$\n    This expression is formulated entirely in terms of the differences between principal stresses. If we were to add a hydrostatic pressure $p$ to the stress state, such that the new principal stresses are $\\sigma'_i = \\sigma_i - p$, the differences remain unchanged: $\\sigma'_i - \\sigma'_j = (\\sigma_i - p) - (\\sigma_j - p) = \\sigma_i - \\sigma_j$. Therefore, $J_2$ is invariant to hydrostatic stress, and so is the von Mises criterion.\n\n2)  The Tresca yield criterion postulates that yielding occurs when the maximum shear stress, $\\tau_{\\text{max}}$, in the material reaches a critical value. In terms of principal stresses, $\\tau_{\\text{max}}$ is given by:\n    $$\n    \\tau_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\max \\left( |\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2|, |\\sigma_2 - \\sigma_3|, |\\sigma_3 - \\sigma_1| \\right)\n    $$\n    Similar to the von Mises criterion, the Tresca criterion depends only on the differences between principal stresses and is therefore inherently insensitive to any superimposed hydrostatic stress component.\n\nBoth criteria correctly formalize the experimental observation that only the distortional part of the stress state, represented by the deviatoric stress tensor, causes yielding in ductile metals.\n\nNow, we apply these criteria to the given stress state. The principal stresses are $\\sigma_1 = 220\\,\\text{MPa}$, $\\sigma_2 = -80\\,\\text{MPa}$, and $\\sigma_3 = 40\\,\\text{MPa}$. The uniaxial tensile yield strength is $\\sigma_y = 250\\,\\text{MPa}$.\n\n**Von Mises Criterion**\n\nThe von Mises equivalent stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{vM}}$, is defined as:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{vM}} = \\sqrt{3 J_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2)^2 + (\\sigma_2 - \\sigma_3)^2 + (\\sigma_3 - \\sigma_1)^2 \\right]}\n$$\nWe compute the stress differences:\n$\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2 = 220 - (-80) = 300\\,\\text{MPa}$\n$\\sigma_2 - \\sigma_3 = -80 - 40 = -120\\,\\text{MPa}$\n$\\sigma_3 - \\sigma_1 = 40 - 220 = -180\\,\\text{MPa}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\sigma_{\\text{vM}}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{vM}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (300)^2 + (-120)^2 + (-180)^2 \\right]} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 90000 + 14400 + 32400 \\right]}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{vM}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} (136800)} = \\sqrt{68400} = 60\\sqrt{19}\\,\\text{MPa}\n$$\nNumerically, $\\sigma_{\\text{vM}} \\approx 261.53\\,\\text{MPa}$. The yield condition is $\\sigma_{\\text{vM}} \\ge \\sigma_y$. Since $261.53\\,\\text{MPa} > 250\\,\\text{MPa}$, yielding **does occur** under the von Mises criterion.\n\nThe safety factor for the von Mises criterion, $n_{\\text{vM}}$, is:\n$$\nn_{\\text{vM}} = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{\\sigma_{\\text{vM}}} = \\frac{250}{60\\sqrt{19}} = \\frac{25}{6\\sqrt{19}}\n$$\n\n**Tresca Criterion**\n\nThe Tresca equivalent stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{T}}$, is defined as twice the maximum shear stress. To find $\\tau_{\\text{max}}$, we order the principal stresses: $\\sigma_{\\text{I}} = 220\\,\\text{MPa}$, $\\sigma_{\\text{II}} = 40\\,\\text{MPa}$, $\\sigma_{\\text{III}} = -80\\,\\text{MPa}$.\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{I}} - \\sigma_{\\text{III}}}{2} = \\frac{220 - (-80)}{2} = \\frac{300}{2} = 150\\,\\text{MPa}\n$$\nThe Tresca equivalent stress is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{T}} = 2\\tau_{\\text{max}} = \\sigma_{\\text{I}} - \\sigma_{\\text{III}} = 300\\,\\text{MPa}\n$$\nThe yield condition is $\\sigma_{\\text{T}} \\ge \\sigma_y$. Since $300\\,\\text{MPa} > 250\\,\\text{MPa}$, yielding **does occur** under the Tresca criterion.\n\nThe safety factor for the Tresca criterion, $n_{\\text{Tresca}}$, is:\n$$\nn_{\\text{Tresca}} = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{\\sigma_{\\text{T}}} = \\frac{250}{300} = \\frac{5}{6}\n$$\n\n**Ratio of Safety Factors**\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio of the Tresca safety factor to the von Mises safety factor:\n$$\n\\frac{n_{\\text{Tresca}}}{n_{\\text{vM}}} = \\frac{5/6}{25/(6\\sqrt{19})} = \\frac{5}{6} \\cdot \\frac{6\\sqrt{19}}{25} = \\frac{\\sqrt{19}}{5}\n$$\nFor the final numerical answer, we calculate this value and round to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\frac{n_{\\text{Tresca}}}{n_{\\text{vM}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{19}}{5} \\approx \\frac{4.3588989}{5} \\approx 0.8717797\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the ratio is $0.8718$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.8718}\n$$", "id": "2909201"}]}
