## Introduction
When structures are subjected to repeated, variable loads—common in power plants, bridges, and aircraft—predicting their long-term behavior becomes a critical engineering challenge. While a structure may withstand a single peak load, it can fail over time through subtle mechanisms like progressive deformation (ratcheting) or [low-cycle fatigue](@entry_id:161555). Shakedown theory provides a rigorous framework for addressing this problem, offering a way to determine if a structure will "shake down" and adapt to the load cycle, eventually responding purely elastically, or if it is destined for failure. It moves beyond simple static strength analysis to provide indispensable tools for ensuring durability and safety under real-world operating conditions.

This article provides a comprehensive exploration of shakedown theorems. The journey begins in the **Principles and Mechanisms** chapter, where we will lay the theoretical groundwork by defining the [constitutive model](@entry_id:747751) of [perfect plasticity](@entry_id:753335) and introducing the two pillars of the theory: Melan's static theorem and Koiter's kinematic theorem. We will explore their mathematical elegance and the profound duality that connects them. Next, the **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections** chapter will bridge theory and practice, demonstrating how these principles are applied to design pressure vessels, justify manufacturing processes like autofrettage, and connect to related fields such as [fatigue analysis](@entry_id:191624) and contact mechanics. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section offers a set of curated problems, guiding you from foundational analytical calculations to modern computational formulations. We will start by examining the fundamental principles that govern the response of elastoplastic structures to cyclic loading.

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter delves into the fundamental principles and mechanisms that govern the long-term behavior of elastoplastic structures subjected to variable repeated loading. We will first establish the constitutive framework of [perfect plasticity](@entry_id:753335), which forms the bedrock of classical shakedown theory. Subsequently, we will explore the different asymptotic response regimes that a structure may enter under cyclic loading. The core of the chapter is a detailed exposition of the two central theorems of [shakedown analysis](@entry_id:201007): the static theorem of Melan and the kinematic theorem of Koiter. We will examine their theoretical underpinnings, their interpretation as lower and upper bounds on the shakedown limit, and the elegant duality that connects them. Finally, we will discuss the crucial role of the underlying assumptions—such as small strains, [convexity](@entry_id:138568) of the [yield surface](@entry_id:175331), and associative [plastic flow](@entry_id:201346)—and the consequences of relaxing them.

### The Constitutive Framework of Perfect Plasticity

The classical theory of shakedown is formulated for materials exhibiting time-independent, elastic-perfectly plastic behavior under the assumption of small strains. The [constitutive model](@entry_id:747751) is defined by a set of core principles that describe the material's response to loading and unloading.

A fundamental premise is the **additive decomposition** of the total [strain rate tensor](@entry_id:198281) $\dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}$ into an elastic part $\dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}^e$ and a plastic part $\dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}^p$:
$$ \dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}} = \dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}^e + \dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}^p $$
The elastic response is governed by a linear (hypoelastic) law, relating the rate of stress $\dot{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ to the elastic strain rate via a fourth-order stiffness tensor $\boldsymbol{C}$, which is assumed to be symmetric and positive-definite:
$$ \dot{\boldsymbol{\sigma}} = \boldsymbol{C} : \dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}^e = \boldsymbol{C} : (\dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}} - \dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}^p) $$
This [linear relationship](@entry_id:267880) is a direct consequence of the small-strain assumption, which decouples geometric and material nonlinearities [@problem_id:2684263].

The transition from elastic to plastic behavior is determined by a **yield criterion**. This is defined by a **yield function**, $f(\boldsymbol{\sigma})$, which describes a surface in the six-dimensional space of stress. The set of all stress states for which the material behaves elastically, known as the **elastic domain**, is defined by the inequality $f(\boldsymbol{\sigma}) \le 0$. The boundary of this domain, given by $f(\boldsymbol{\sigma}) = 0$, is the **yield surface**. In **[perfect plasticity](@entry_id:753335)**, this yield surface is fixed in [stress space](@entry_id:199156) and does not change with the accumulation of plastic strain. Any stress state satisfying $f(\boldsymbol{\sigma}) > 0$ is physically inadmissible.

A critical property required by the shakedown theorems is the **convexity** of the elastic domain [@problem_id:2684348]. This means that for any two stress states $\boldsymbol{\sigma}_1$ and $\boldsymbol{\sigma}_2$ within the elastic domain, the entire line segment connecting them, $\lambda\boldsymbol{\sigma}_1 + (1-\lambda)\boldsymbol{\sigma}_2$ for $\lambda \in [0, 1]$, also lies within the domain. Most physically-based [yield criteria](@entry_id:178101), such as the **von Mises** and **Tresca** criteria, define convex domains.
*   The **von Mises criterion** posits that yielding occurs when the second invariant of the deviatoric stress, $J_2 = \frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{s}:\boldsymbol{s}$, reaches a critical value. It defines a smooth, strictly convex cylindrical surface in [principal stress space](@entry_id:184388).
*   The **Tresca criterion** states that yielding occurs when the maximum shear stress reaches a critical value. It defines a hexagonal prism in [principal stress space](@entry_id:184388). This surface is convex but not strictly convex, as it contains flat faces and sharp corners. The presence of corners does not violate convexity, and the shakedown theorems are fully applicable to such materials [@problem_id:2684348].

The direction of [plastic flow](@entry_id:201346) is governed by a **[flow rule](@entry_id:177163)**. The classical theory assumes an **[associated flow rule](@entry_id:201731)**, which states that the plastic strain rate vector $\dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}^p$ is normal to the yield surface at the current stress state. Mathematically, this is expressed as:
$$ \dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}^p = \dot{\lambda} \frac{\partial f}{\partial \boldsymbol{\sigma}} $$
where $\dot{\lambda} \ge 0$ is the **[plastic multiplier](@entry_id:753519)**, a scalar that determines the magnitude of [plastic flow](@entry_id:201346). The [associated flow rule](@entry_id:201731) is a consequence of Drucker's stability postulate and ensures that the [plastic dissipation](@entry_id:201273), $\mathcal{D} = \boldsymbol{\sigma} : \dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}^p$, is non-negative.

The complete behavior is elegantly summarized by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) or complementarity conditions:
$$ f(\boldsymbol{\sigma}) \le 0, \quad \dot{\lambda} \ge 0, \quad \dot{\lambda} f(\boldsymbol{\sigma}) = 0 $$
These conditions state that plastic flow ($\dot{\lambda} > 0$) can only occur when the stress state is on the [yield surface](@entry_id:175331) ($f(\boldsymbol{\sigma}) = 0$). If the stress state is strictly inside the elastic domain ($f(\boldsymbol{\sigma})  0$), there is no [plastic flow](@entry_id:201346) ($\dot{\lambda} = 0$). During [plastic loading](@entry_id:753518), the stress state must remain on the yield surface, which imposes the **consistency condition** $\dot{f}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}) = 0$ [@problem_id:2916236].

### Asymptotic Regimes of Structural Response

When a structure is subjected to a periodic or otherwise variable load history, its long-term response can be classified into several distinct regimes. Shakedown theory provides the tools to predict which regime a structure will enter [@problem_id:2684325].

1.  **Elastic Shakedown:** After an initial period of plastic deformation, the structure develops a pattern of self-equilibrated residual stresses. This [internal stress](@entry_id:190887) field adapts the structure to the load cycle in such a way that all subsequent response to the same cycle is purely elastic. Operationally, this means there exists a time $t_0$ after which the plastic strain rate vanishes, $\dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}^p(t) = \boldsymbol{0}$ for all $t \ge t_0$. The total accumulated plastic strain $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^p$ approaches a constant, finite value. This is the most desirable outcome for long-term [structural integrity](@entry_id:165319).

2.  **Plastic Shakedown (Alternating Plasticity):** In this regime, [plastic deformation](@entry_id:139726) does not cease, but it becomes periodic. After the initial transients die out, the structure undergoes a closed cycle of plastic straining, where [plastic flow](@entry_id:201346) occurs in one direction during one part of the load cycle and in the reverse direction during another part. The defining characteristic is that the net accumulation of plastic strain over one full load cycle is zero:
    $$ \Delta\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^p = \int_{t}^{t+T} \dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}^p(\tau) \, \mathrm{d}\tau = \boldsymbol{0} $$
    While the structure does not exhibit progressive deformation, the repeated plastic straining can lead to failure by **[low-cycle fatigue](@entry_id:161555)**.

3.  **Ratcheting (Incremental Collapse):** This is a non-shakedown regime characterized by a continuous, cycle-by-cycle accumulation of plastic strain. The net plastic strain increment per cycle is non-zero, $\Delta\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^p \neq \boldsymbol{0}$. This leads to an unbounded growth of plastic deformation, often manifesting as a progressive change in the structure's shape. Ratcheting is a mode of structural failure due to excessive deformation.

It is crucial to distinguish [shakedown analysis](@entry_id:201007) from **limit load analysis**. Limit analysis determines the single load multiplier at which a structure collapses under **monotonic loading**. Shakedown analysis, in contrast, considers the effects of **repeated, variable loading**. A structure may fail by ratcheting or alternating plasticity under a cyclic load whose peak magnitude is significantly lower than the monotonic collapse load. This is because residual stresses, which can be beneficial in adapting to a load cycle, do not have a chance to develop fully under monotonic loading [@problem_id:2684243].

### Melan's Static Shakedown Theorem (The Lower Bound)

Melan's static theorem provides a powerful [sufficient condition](@entry_id:276242) for establishing elastic shakedown. It is known as a **lower-bound** theorem because it identifies a "safe" domain of loading for which shakedown is guaranteed.

The central idea is the decomposition of the actual stress $\boldsymbol{\sigma}(\mathbf{x}, t)$ into a fictitious elastic stress $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^e(\mathbf{x}, t)$ and a [residual stress](@entry_id:138788) $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^r(\mathbf{x}, t)$:
$$ \boldsymbol{\sigma}(\mathbf{x}, t) = \boldsymbol{\sigma}^e(\mathbf{x}, t) + \boldsymbol{\sigma}^r(\mathbf{x}, t) $$
The fictitious elastic stress $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^e$ is the response the structure would have if it were purely elastic. The residual stress $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^r$ is the self-equilibrated stress field generated by the history of incompatible plastic strains. The linearity of the elastic problem (a consequence of small strains) is essential for this superposition to be a meaningful analytical tool [@problem_id:2684263].

Melan's theorem can be stated as follows [@problem_id:2684337]:

*A structure will shake down elastically under a given set of load histories if there exists a **time-independent**, **self-equilibrated** [residual stress](@entry_id:138788) field $\boldsymbol{\rho}(\mathbf{x})$ such that the sum of this field and the fictitious elastic stress $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^e(\mathbf{x}, t)$ corresponding to any of the applied loads remains within the elastic domain at all points in the structure and at all times.*

Mathematically, if one can find a single field $\boldsymbol{\rho}(\mathbf{x})$ satisfying $\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\rho} = \boldsymbol{0}$ (with appropriate boundary conditions) such that:
$$ f(\boldsymbol{\sigma}^e(\mathbf{x}, t) + \boldsymbol{\rho}(\mathbf{x})) \le 0 $$
for all $\mathbf{x}$ and for all possible times $t$, then elastic shakedown is guaranteed.

The power of this theorem lies in the requirement that the trial residual stress field $\boldsymbol{\rho}$ be **time-independent**. Allowing it to be time-dependent would render the theorem trivial, as the actual residual stress field always satisfies the condition by definition [@problem_id:2916236]. The challenge is to find a single, constant residual field that contains the entire history of elastic stresses within the [yield surface](@entry_id:175331). The largest [load factor](@entry_id:637044) for which such a field exists is the shakedown limit.

A remarkable simplification arises from this formulation. Because the elastic stress map is linear and the yield set is convex, one only needs to check the shakedown inequality at the **[extreme points](@entry_id:273616)** (vertices) of the convex load domain. If the condition holds for a residual field at all vertices, it is guaranteed to hold for any load combination within that domain [@problem_id:2684238]. This reduces a problem over an infinite number of load histories to a check at a finite number of points for polyhedral load domains, making the static method computationally tractable.

### Koiter's Kinematic Shakedown Theorem (The Upper Bound)

Koiter's kinematic theorem provides a complementary perspective. It establishes a sufficient condition for the *failure* of shakedown (i.e., for the onset of ratcheting or alternating plasticity). It is therefore known as an **upper-bound** theorem, as it provides a potentially "unsafe" limit; any load exceeding this bound will cause failure.

The theorem is based on the principle of virtual power and [energy balance](@entry_id:150831) over a load cycle. It considers hypothetical [failure mechanisms](@entry_id:184047) described by kinematically admissible cycles of plastic [strain rate](@entry_id:154778). The formal statement is as follows [@problem_id:2684316]:

*Shakedown is impossible (i.e., ratcheting or alternating plasticity will occur) if there exists any kinematically admissible plastic [strain rate](@entry_id:154778) mechanism $\dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}^p(\mathbf{x},t)$ over a cycle of period $T$ such that the average rate of work done by the external loads exceeds the average rate of internal [plastic dissipation](@entry_id:201273).*

Mathematically, non-shakedown is guaranteed if one can find a mechanism $(\boldsymbol{v}, \dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}^p)$ for which:
$$ \left\langle \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{b}\cdot \boldsymbol{v}\,\mathrm{d}V + \int_{\Gamma_t} \boldsymbol{t}\cdot \boldsymbol{v}\,\mathrm{d}S \right\rangle  \left\langle \int_{\Omega} \phi(\dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}^p(\mathbf{x},t))\,\mathrm{d}V \right\rangle $$
where $\langle \cdot \rangle$ denotes the average over a cycle, and $\phi(\dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}^p)$ is the [plastic dissipation](@entry_id:201273) functional. For an [associated flow rule](@entry_id:201731) and a convex yield set $\mathcal{Y}$, this functional is given by the **[support function](@entry_id:755667)** of the yield set:
$$ \phi(\dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}^p) = \sup_{\boldsymbol{\sigma}\in\mathcal{Y}} \boldsymbol{\sigma} : \dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}^p $$
The convexity of the yield set is essential, as it ensures that the dissipation functional $\phi$ is itself convex and well-behaved, which underpins the energy estimates used in the proof [@problem_id:2684348].

### Duality and the Exact Shakedown Limit

Melan's static theorem and Koiter's kinematic theorem are not independent; they are intimately related through the mathematical principle of **duality**. The static theorem can be cast as a primal optimization problem in the space of stresses, seeking the largest [load factor](@entry_id:637044) for which a feasible residual stress exists. The kinematic theorem can be shown to be its Lagrange dual problem, formulated in the space of strain rates [@problem_id:2684336].

This duality is a profound consequence of the constitutive structure of associative plasticity. The relationship between the convex yield set $\mathcal{Y}$ and its [support function](@entry_id:755667) (the dissipation functional $\phi$) is one of convex conjugacy. The Fenchel-Young inequality, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}:\dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}^p \le I_{\mathcal{Y}}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}) + \phi(\dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}^p)$, links the two spaces. For a stable material with an [associated flow rule](@entry_id:201731), this inequality becomes an equality, signifying the absence of a "[duality gap](@entry_id:173383)" [@problem_id:2916222].

Under the classical assumptions—small strains, [perfect plasticity](@entry_id:753335), [convex yield surface](@entry_id:203690), and an [associated flow rule](@entry_id:201731)—[strong duality](@entry_id:176065) holds. This means the lower bound provided by Melan's theorem and the upper bound provided by Koiter's theorem coincide. Together, they furnish the **exact shakedown limit**.

The exactness of the theorems, however, is contingent on these assumptions. If they are relaxed, the bounds may diverge:
*   **Non-Associated Flow Rule:** If the plastic potential function differs from the [yield function](@entry_id:167970), the [plastic dissipation](@entry_id:201273) is no longer equal to the [support function](@entry_id:755667) of the yield set. This introduces a [duality gap](@entry_id:173383), and the kinematic theorem provides an upper bound that is generally not tight [@problem_id:2916222].
*   **Non-Convex Yield Surface:** This may occur in materials exhibiting plastic softening. Convexity is essential for the proofs of both theorems. Applying the kinematic theorem to a material with a non-convex yield set implicitly computes the shakedown limit for a stronger, "convexified" version of the material, thus overestimating the true limit [@problem_id:2684263] [@problem_id:2916222].
*   **Finite Strains:** Geometric nonlinearities destroy the linear [superposition principle](@entry_id:144649) upon which Melan's theorem is built. The clean separation of stresses into elastic and residual parts is lost, and the classical theorem no longer applies [@problem_id:2684263].
*   **Rate-Dependent Plasticity (Viscoplasticity):** In rate-dependent materials, the stress can exceed the static yield surface, and the [plastic flow](@entry_id:201346) depends on the loading rate. The concept of a single shakedown limit independent of load frequency breaks down.

In summary, the shakedown theorems provide a rigorous and elegant framework for the design of structures under variable loading. Their power lies in their ability to predict long-term behavior without performing complex, step-by-step incremental analyses. However, their application requires a clear understanding of their foundational assumptions, as they define the domain of validity for these indispensable tools of [structural mechanics](@entry_id:276699).
