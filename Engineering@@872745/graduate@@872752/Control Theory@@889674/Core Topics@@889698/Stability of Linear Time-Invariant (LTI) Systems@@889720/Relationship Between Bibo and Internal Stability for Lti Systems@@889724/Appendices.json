The system is internally stable if and only if all eigenvalues of $A$ have strictly negative real parts. The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(\\lambda I - A) = 0$.\nFor the given matrix $A$, which is diagonal, the eigenvalues are its diagonal entries.\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$.\nSince the eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1$ has a positive real part, $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_1) = 1 > 0$, the system is not internally stable. In fact, it is internally unstable. The presence of this eigenvalue means that for zero input, an initial state with a component in the direction of the corresponding eigenvector will grow exponentially as $e^{t}$, leading to an unbounded state vector.\n\nNext, we analyze the Bounded-Input–Bounded-Output (BIBO) stability of the input-output map.\nA system is defined as BIBO-stable if every bounded input signal produces a bounded output signal. For a continuous-time LTI system, this property is equivalent to the condition that all poles of its transfer function $G(s)$ lie in the open left-half of the complex plane, i.e., they must all have strictly negative real parts. The transfer function is given by the formula $G(s) = C(sI - A)^{-1}B + D$.\n\nWe compute the transfer function for the given realization.\nThe term $(sI-A)$ is\n$$\nsI - A = s\\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  -2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} s-1  0 \\\\ 0  s+2 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nIts inverse is\n$$\n(sI - A)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{(s-1)(s+2)}\\begin{pmatrix} s+2  0 \\\\ 0  s-1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{s-1}  0 \\\\ 0  \\frac{1}{s+2} \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nNow, we compute $G(s)$, noting that $D=0$:\n$$\nG(s) = C(sI - A)^{-1}B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{s-1}  0 \\\\ 0  \\frac{1}{s+2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nPerforming the matrix multiplication:\n$$\nG(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\frac{1}{s+2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\cdot 1 + \\left(\\frac{1}{s+2}\\right) \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{s+2}.\n$$\nThe transfer function is $G(s) = \\frac{1}{s+2}$. The poles of $G(s)$ are the roots of its denominator, so we solve $s+2=0$, which yields a single pole at $s = -2$. Since the real part of this pole is strictly negative, the system is BIBO-stable.\n\nFinally, we must reconcile the findings: the realization is internally unstable, yet the input-output map is BIBO-stable. This phenomenon is explained by a pole-zero cancellation. The poles of the transfer function are a subset of the eigenvalues of $A$. The eigenvalues of $A$, which are $s=1$ and $s=-2$, are the poles of the *system*. The poles of the *transfer function* are only those system poles that are both controllable and observable.\nLet us examine the full expression for the transfer function, $G(s) = \\frac{C \\cdot \\text{adj}(sI-A) \\cdot B}{\\det(sI-A)}$.\nThe determinant is $\\det(sI-A) = (s-1)(s+2)$. The denominator contains both the stable and the unstable system poles.\nThe numerator is $C \\cdot \\text{adj}(sI-A) \\cdot B$. The adjugate matrix is $\\text{adj}(sI-A) = \\begin{pmatrix} s+2  0 \\\\ 0  s-1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$$\nC \\cdot \\text{adj}(sI-A) \\cdot B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} s+2  0 \\\\ 0  s-1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  s-1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = s-1.\n$$\nTherefore, the transfer function before simplification is\n$$\nG(s) = \\frac{s-1}{(s-1)(s+2)}.\n$$\nHere, it is evident that there is a zero at $s=1$ which cancels the unstable pole at $s=1$. This cancellation occurs because the unstable mode associated with the eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1$ is unobservable.\nTo verify this, we check the observability of this mode. A mode corresponding to an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is unobservable if its associated right eigenvector $v$ satisfies $Cv=0$.\nFor $\\lambda_1 = 1$, the right eigenvector $v_1$ is found by solving $(A - \\lambda_1 I)v_1 = 0$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1-1  0 \\\\ 0  -2-1 \\end{pmatrix} v_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  -3 \\end{pmatrix} v_1 = 0.\n$$\nThis gives $v_1 = k \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ for any non-zero scalar $k$. Let's choose $k=1$. We then test for observability:\n$$\nCv_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 0.\n$$\nSince $Cv_1 = 0$, the mode is indeed unobservable. The internal state corresponding to the unstable eigenvalue cannot be seen at the output. Consequently, the instability of this internal mode does not affect the input-output relationship, resulting in a BIBO-stable system despite the internal instability.\n\nThe requested computation is the final expression for the transfer function.
