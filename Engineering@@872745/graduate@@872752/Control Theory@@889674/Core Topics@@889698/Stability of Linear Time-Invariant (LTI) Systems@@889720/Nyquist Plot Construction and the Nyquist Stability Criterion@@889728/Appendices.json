It asks for the determination of a specific point on the Nyquist plot for a given linear time-invariant system. We are to find the unique positive frequency, $\\omega_{\\star}$, at which the Nyquist curve of the open-loop transfer function intersects the real axis, and the corresponding value of this intersection, $x_{\\star}$. This is a standard procedure required for stability analysis using the Nyquist criterion.\n\nThe given open-loop transfer function is\n$$L(s) = \\frac{50}{(s+1)(s+2)(s+5)}$$\nTo construct the Nyquist plot, we evaluate the transfer function along the imaginary axis by substituting $s = j\\omega$, where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency in radians per second. This yields the frequency response function $L(j\\omega)$.\n$$L(j\\omega) = \\frac{50}{(j\\omega+1)(j\\omega+2)(j\\omega+5)}$$\nTo separate the real and imaginary parts of $L(j\\omega)$, we first expand the polynomial in the denominator:\n$$ (j\\omega+1)(j\\omega+2)(j\\omega+5) = ((j\\omega)^2 + 3(j\\omega) + 2)(j\\omega+5) $$\n$$ = (-\\omega^2 + 3j\\omega + 2)(j\\omega+5) $$\n$$ = 5(-\\omega^2 + 2) + 5(3j\\omega) + j\\omega(-\\omega^2 + 2) + j\\omega(3j\\omega) $$\n$$ = -5\\omega^2 + 10 + 15j\\omega - j\\omega^3 + 2j\\omega - 3\\omega^2 $$\n$$ = (10 - 8\\omega^2) + j(17\\omega - \\omega^3) $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $L(j\\omega)$, we obtain:\n$$ L(j\\omega) = \\frac{50}{(10 - 8\\omega^2) + j(17\\omega - \\omega^3)} $$\nTo express this in the standard complex form $X+jY$, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is $(10 - 8\\omega^2) - j(17\\omega - \\omega^3)$:\n$$ L(j\\omega) = \\frac{50 \\left[ (10 - 8\\omega^2) - j(17\\omega - \\omega^3) \\right]}{\\left[ (10 - 8\\omega^2) + j(17\\omega - \\omega^3) \\right] \\left[ (10 - 8\\omega^2) - j(17\\omega - \\omega^3) \\right]} $$\n$$ L(j\\omega) = \\frac{50(10 - 8\\omega^2) - j50(17\\omega - \\omega^3)}{(10 - 8\\omega^2)^2 + (17\\omega - \\omega^3)^2} $$\nThe real part, $\\Re\\{L(j\\omega)\\}$, and imaginary part, $\\Im\\{L(j\\omega)\\}$, are therefore:\n$$ \\Re\\{L(j\\omega)\\} = \\frac{50(10 - 8\\omega^2)}{(10 - 8\\omega^2)^2 + (17\\omega - \\omega^3)^2} $$\n$$ \\Im\\{L(j\\omega)\\} = \\frac{-50(17\\omega - \\omega^3)}{(10 - 8\\omega^2)^2 + (17\\omega - \\omega^3)^2} $$\nThe Nyquist plot crosses the real axis when the imaginary part is zero, i.e., $\\Im\\{L(j\\omega_{\\star})\\} = 0$. The denominator of $\\Im\\{L(j\\omega)\\}$ is a sum of squares and is thus positive for all $\\omega  0$.

When poles lie on the contour, one constructs a modified contour that detours around those singularities and then accounts for the contributions of the detours explicitly.\n\nHere, $F(s)=1+L(s)$ with $L(s)=\\dfrac{K}{s\\left(s^{2}+4\\right)}$ has simple poles at $s=0$ and $s=\\pm 2j$ because the denominator factors as $s\\left(s-2j\\right)\\left(s+2j\\right)$ with distinct linear factors.

It presents a standard problem in control theory that can be solved using fundamental principles. The validation criteria are met, and we may proceed with a solution.\n\nThe loop transfer function is given by $L(s) = \\dfrac{K(s-1)}{(s+1)(s+2)}$, where $K$ is a positive real gain, $K > 0$. The number of open-loop poles in the Right-Half-Plane (RHP) is $P=0$. The system has a nonminimum-phase zero at $s=+1$.\n\nTo find the real-axis intersections, we evaluate $L(s)$ at $s=j\\omega$ and find when its imaginary part is zero. First, we find the expression for $L(j\\omega)$:\n$$L(j\\omega) = \\frac{K(-1+j\\omega)}{(j\\omega+1)(j\\omega+2)} = \\left. \\frac{K(-1+j\\omega)}{s^2+3s+2}\\right|_{s=j\\omega} = \\frac{K(-1+j\\omega)}{(2-\\omega^2)+j3\\omega}$$\nTo separate the real and imaginary parts, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, $(2-\\omega^2)-j3\\omega$:\n$$L(j\\omega) = \\frac{K(-1+j\\omega)((2-\\omega^2)-j3\\omega)}{((2-\\omega^2)+j3\\omega)((2-\\omega^2)-j3\\omega)} = \\frac{K[(-1)(2-\\omega^2) + 3\\omega^2 + j(\\omega(2-\\omega^2)+3\\omega)]}{(2-\\omega^2)^2 + (3\\omega)^2}$$\n$$L(j\\omega) = K \\frac{(4\\omega^2-2) + j\\omega(5 - \\omega^2)}{(2-\\omega^2)^2 + 9\\omega^2}$$\nReal-axis crossings occur when $\\text{Im}[L(j\\omega)]=0$, so $\\omega(5-\\omega^2)=0$. This yields $\\omega=0$ or $\\omega=\\pm\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nWe evaluate the real part of $L(j\\omega)$ at these frequencies to find the intersection points:\n1.  At $\\omega=0$: $L(j0) = \\frac{K(0-1)}{(0+1)(0+2)} = -\\frac{K}{2}$.\n2.  At $\\omega=\\sqrt{5}$:\n    $$ L(j\\sqrt{5}) = K \\frac{4(5)-2}{(2-5)^2 + 9(5)} = K \\frac{18}{(-3)^2+45} = K \\frac{18}{9+45} = K \\frac{18}{54} = \\frac{K}{3} $$\n\n1) The first question is whether the presence of the RHP zero forces the Nyquist plot to encircle $-1$ for any positive $K$.\nThe RHP zero causes the phase at $\\omega=0$ to be $\\pi$, forcing the plot to start on the negative real axis at $-K/2$. For $\\omega>0$, the plot proceeds into the upper half-plane, crosses the positive real axis at $K/3$ (when $\\omega=\\sqrt{5}$), and approaches the origin. The full plot for $\\omega \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$ forms a loop. An encirclement of $-1$ occurs if and only if $-1$ lies between the real-axis crossings, i.e., $-K/2  -1  K/3$. This requires $K>2$. If $0  K \\le 2$, then $-1 \\le -K/2  0$, and $-1$ is not encircled. Therefore, the RHP zero does not force an encirclement for *any* positive $K$; it depends on the magnitude of $K$.\n\n2) The second question is to find the largest positive gain $K$ for which the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable.\nWe use the Nyquist Stability Criterion, $N = Z - P$, where $N$ is the number of counter-clockwise encirclements of $-1$, $Z$ is the number of unstable closed-loop poles, and $P$ is the number of unstable open-loop poles. We are given $P=0$. For asymptotic stability, we require $Z=0$, which means the stability condition is $N=0$.\n\nWe must determine the range of $K > 0$ for which $N=0$.\n- If $0  K  2$, then $-1  -K/2  0$. The critical point $-1$ is to the left of the plot's starting point and is not enclosed by the loop. Thus, $N=0$. The system is asymptotically stable.\n- If $K=2$, then $-K/2 = -1$. The Nyquist plot passes directly through the critical point $-1$. This corresponds to a closed-loop pole on the imaginary axis, so the system is marginally stable, not asymptotically stable.\n- If $K > 2$, then $-K/2  -1$. The critical point $-1$ is enclosed by the Nyquist plot's loop. To determine the number of encirclements $N$, we check the loop's direction. As $\\omega$ increases from $0$ to $\\sqrt{5}$, the imaginary part $\\text{Im}[L(j\\omega)] = K \\frac{\\omega(5 - \\omega^2)}{(2-\\omega^2)^2 + 9\\omega^2}$ is positive, meaning the plot for $\\omega>0$ enters the upper half-plane. This indicates the loop is traced in a counter-clockwise direction. Therefore, for $K>2$, the point $-1$ is encircled once counter-clockwise, meaning $N = +1$. Applying the Nyquist stability criterion, $Z = N + P = 1 + 0 = 1$. This means there is one closed-loop pole in the RHP, and the system is unstable.\n\nThe condition for asymptotic stability is $0  K  2$. The question asks for the \"largest positive gain $K$\" for which this holds. The set of such $K$ is the open interval $(0, 2)$, which has no maximum. The standard engineering interpretation is to find the boundary of stability, which is the supremum of this set. The supremum of the interval $(0, 2)$ is $2$.\n\nVerification using the characteristic polynomial $1+L(s)=0$:\n$(s+1)(s+2) + K(s-1) = 0$\n$s^2 + 3s + 2 + Ks - K = 0$\n$s^2 + (3+K)s + (2-K) = 0$\nFor a second-order polynomial with real coefficients to have all its roots in the strict Left-Half-Plane, it is necessary and sufficient that all coefficients are positive.\n1.
