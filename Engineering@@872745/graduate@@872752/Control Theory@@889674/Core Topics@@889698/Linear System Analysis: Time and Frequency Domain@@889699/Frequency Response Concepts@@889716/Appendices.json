In this limit, the ratios $\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{z}}$ and $\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{p}}$ both approach zero.

A change of one decade in frequency corresponds to a change of $1$ in $\\log_{10}(\\omega)$. Therefore, the low-frequency asymptotic slope is $-20$ decibels per decade.\n\nSecond, we analyze the high-frequency asymptote, where $\\omega \\to \\infty$. In this limit, the ratios $\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{z}}$ and $\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{p}}$ both approach infinity.

Therefore, the high-frequency asymptotic slope is $-60$ decibels per decade.\n\nThe slopes are therefore $-20$ dB/decade at low frequencies and $-60$ dB/decade at high frequencies.\n\nNow, for the interpretation in a feedback context. We consider the plant $G(s)$ in a standard unity feedback loop with a controller $C(s)$, so the open-loop transfer function is $L(s) = C(s)G(s)$.\n\nThe low-frequency slope of $-20$ dB/decade is a direct consequence of the single pole at the origin ($1/s$ term) in $G(s)$. This term represents an integrator. In a feedback loop, the presence of an integrator in the open-loop path results in an infinite DC gain, i.e., $|L(j\\omega)| \\to \\infty$ as $\\omega \\to 0$ (assuming the controller $C(s)$ has a non-zero DC gain $C(0)$). According to the Final Value Theorem, this infinite DC gain ensures that the steady-state error for a constant (step) reference input is zero. Thus, the $-20$ dB/decade low-frequency slope signifies high loop gain at low frequencies, which is fundamental for achieving good low-frequency reference tracking.\n\nThe high-frequency slope of $-60$ dB/decade indicates a very rapid decrease in the plant's gain as frequency increases. In a feedback system, high-frequency measurement noise is a significant concern. The transfer function from the measurement noise to the system output is the complementary sensitivity function, $T(s) = \\frac{L(s)}{1+L(s)}$. At high frequencies, the loop gain $|L(j\\omega)|$ is typically designed to be much less than $1$. In this regime, $T(j\\omega) \\approx L(j\\omega) = C(j\\omega)G(j\\omega)$. Assuming a standard controller $C(s)$ that does not add gain at high frequencies (i.e., is proper or strictly proper), the high-frequency roll-off of the loop is dominated by the plant's roll-off. A steep slope of $-60$ dB/decade ($1000$-fold attenuation for every $10$-fold increase in frequency) implies that the system provides excellent attenuation of high-frequency measurement noise, preventing it from corrupting the output.

To find its extrema, we compute the derivative with respect to $x$:\n$$f'(x) = \\dfrac{d}{dx}\\left(\\dfrac{1+x}{1+25x}\\right) = \\dfrac{1 \\cdot (1+25x) - (1+x) \\cdot 25}{(1+25x)^2} = \\dfrac{1+25x - 25 - 25x}{(1+25x)^2} = \\dfrac{-24}{(1+25x)^2}$$\nFor all $x \\ge 0$, the denominator $(1+25x)^2$ is positive, so $f'(x)$ is strictly negative. This implies that $f(x)$ is a strictly decreasing function for $x \\ge 0$.\nThe maximum value of a strictly decreasing function on the interval $[0, \\infty)$ occurs at the left endpoint, $x=0$.\n$x=0$ corresponds to $\\omega^2 = 0$, which means $\\omega=0$. Therefore, the supremum of $|T(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)|$ is its value at $\\omega = 0$.\n$$M_T = |T(\\mathrm{j} \\cdot 0)| = 3 \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1 + 0^2}{1 + 25 \\cdot 0^2}} = 3 \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{1}} = 3$$\nAlternatively, evaluating $T(s)$ at $s=0$:\n$$T(0) = \\dfrac{3(0-1)}{5(0)-1} = \\dfrac{-3}{-1} = 3$$\nThus, $M_T = |T(0)| = 3$. This result demonstrates that despite the closed-loop system being unstable, its frequency response magnitude is bounded.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "2709045"}]}
