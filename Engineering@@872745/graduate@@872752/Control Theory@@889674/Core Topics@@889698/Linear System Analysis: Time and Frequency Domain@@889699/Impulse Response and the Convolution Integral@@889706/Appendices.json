{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding the impulse response begins with appreciating the unique role of the Dirac delta distribution, $\\delta(t)$, in the convolution operation. This exercise guides you through a foundational proof demonstrating that the delta distribution acts as the identity element for convolution, meaning that convolving a signal with a shifted delta function simply shifts the signal in time.

Your final answer must be a single simplified analytic expression in terms of $x$, $t$, and $t_{0}$, with no units required.", "solution": "The problem requires the evaluation of the convolution of a shifted Dirac delta distribution, $\\delta(t-t_{0})$, with a locally integrable signal $x(t)$. The expression to be evaluated is $(\\delta(t-t_{0})*x)(t)$.\n\nWe begin with the integral definition of convolution provided:\n$$(f*g)(t)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(\\tau)\\,g(t-\\tau)\\,d\\tau$$\nLet us identify $f(t)$ with the shifted Dirac delta distribution, $\\delta(t-t_{0})$, and $g(t)$ with the signal $x(t)$. Substituting these into the definition yields the formal integral expression for the convolution:\n$$(\\delta(t-t_{0})*x)(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(\\tau-t_{0})\\,x(t-\\tau)\\,d\\tau$$\nThis integral must be interpreted in the sense of the theory of distributions, since the Dirac delta $\\delta(\\tau)$ is not a function in the traditional sense but an object defined by its action on a space of test functions.\n\nThe problem provides the defining sifting property of the Dirac delta distribution:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(\\tau-a)\\,\\varphi(\\tau)\\,d\\tau = \\varphi(a)$$\nThis property holds for any sufficiently well-behaved function $\\varphi$, specifically for any smooth, compactly supported test function. A comparison of the convolution integral with the sifting property integral suggests an identification. We can set the integration variable to be $\\tau$, the integration center to be $a=t_{0}$, and the function being acted upon to be $\\varphi(\\tau) = x(t-\\tau)$.\n\nHowever, a rigorous application of this property is not immediate. The function $\\varphi(\\tau) = x(t-\\tau)$ is, for a fixed $t$, a function of $\\tau$. The problem states that $x$ is only locally integrable ($x \\in L^{1}_{\\text{loc}}(\\mathbb{R})$), which means $\\varphi(\\tau)$ is not, in general, a smooth, compactly supported test function. Therefore, the straightforward application of the sifting property requires justification.\n\nThe justification proceeds from the rigorous definition of convolution involving distributions. The convolution of a distribution $S$ with compact support with a distribution $T$ is a well-defined distribution. The distribution corresponding to $\\delta(t-t_{0})$, which we denote by $\\delta_{t_{0}}$, has compact support, namely the singleton set $\\{t_0\\}$. The function $x \\in L^{1}_{\\text{loc}}(\\mathbb{R})$ defines a regular distribution, which we denote $T_x$. Thus, the convolution $\\delta_{t_{0}} * T_x$ is well-defined.\n\nTo identify the resulting distribution, we test it against an arbitrary smooth test function with compact support, $\\phi \\in C^{\\infty}_{c}(\\mathbb{R})$. Let $y(t) = (\\delta(t-t_{0})*x)(t)$. We must show that the distribution corresponding to $y(t)$ is the same as the distribution corresponding to the function $x(t-t_0)$. This is equivalent to showing that $\\langle y, \\phi \\rangle = \\langle x(\\cdot-t_{0}), \\phi \\rangle$ for all test functions $\\phi$.\n\nLet us evaluate both sides. The right-hand side is, by definition of the distribution associated with a locally integrable function:\n$$\\langle x(\\cdot-t_{0}), \\phi \\rangle = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t-t_{0})\\,\\phi(t)\\,dt$$\nUsing a change of variables $u = t - t_{0}$ (so $t = u + t_{0}$ and $dt = du$), this becomes:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(u)\\,\\phi(u+t_{0})\\,du$$\n\nNow we evaluate the left-hand side, $\\langle y, \\phi \\rangle = \\langle \\delta_{t_{0}} * T_x, \\phi \\rangle$. Using a fundamental property of convolution for distributions, $\\langle S * T, \\phi \\rangle = \\langle T, \\check{S} * \\phi \\rangle$, where $\\check{S}$ is the reflection of the distribution $S$, defined by $\\langle \\check{S}, \\phi \\rangle = \\langle S, \\check{\\phi} \\rangle$ with $\\check{\\phi}(t) = \\phi(-t)$. For $S = \\delta_{t_{0}}$, we have $\\check{S} = \\delta_{-t_{0}}$, the distribution for $\\delta(t+t_0)$. So:\n$$\\langle \\delta_{t_{0}} * T_x, \\phi \\rangle = \\langle T_x, \\delta_{-t_{0}} * \\phi \\rangle$$\nThe convolution $\\delta_{-t_{0}} * \\phi$ is a convolution of a distribution with a test function, which is a smooth function given by:\n$$(\\delta_{-t_{0}} * \\phi)(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(\\tau+t_{0})\\,\\phi(t-\\tau)\\,d\\tau$$\nThis integral is of the form for which the sifting property is rigorously applicable, since for fixed $t$, the function $\\psi(\\tau) = \\phi(t-\\tau)$ is also a test function. The delta distribution is centered at $\\tau = -t_{0}$. Applying the sifting property, we get:\n$$(\\delta_{-t_{0}} * \\phi)(t) = \\phi(t - (-t_{0})) = \\phi(t+t_{0})$$\nSubstituting this result back, we have:\n$$\\langle \\delta_{t_{0}} * T_x, \\phi \\rangle = \\langle T_x, \\phi(\\cdot+t_{0}) \\rangle = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t)\\,\\phi(t+t_{0})\\,dt$$\nComparing the results for the left-hand side and the right-hand side, we see they are identical. Since $\\langle y, \\phi \\rangle = \\langle x(\\cdot-t_{0}), \\phi \\rangle$ for all test functions $\\phi$, the distributions are equal. Therefore, the function resulting from the convolution is:\n$$(\\delta(t-t_{0})*x)(t) = x(t-t_{0})$$\nThis result is fundamental in the theory of linear time-invariant systems, where it shows that the Dirac delta impulse acts as the identity element for convolution, except for a time shift. The response of a system to a shifted impulse is the shifted impulse response of the system. In this problem, $x(t)$ convolves with an impulse, resulting in a shifted version of $x(t)$ itself. The procedure justifies treating the formal integral $\\int \\delta(\\tau-t_0) x(t-\\tau) d\\tau$ by directly applying the sifting property to the function $\\varphi(\\tau)=x(t-\\tau)$, even if $x$ is not smooth, provided the convolution is understood in the sense of distributions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{x(t-t_{0})}\n$$", "id": "2712272"}, {"introduction": "Building on the properties of the impulse, we now explore its relationship with another fundamental signal: the unit step function.

For zero initial conditions, the system equations become:\n$$sE X(s) = A X(s) + B U(s)$$\n$$Y(s) = C X(s) + D U(s)$$\nThe transfer function $G(s)$ from input $U(s)$ to output $Y(s)$ is given by:\n$$G(s) = C(sE-A)^{-1}B + D$$\nThe impulse response $g(t)$ is the inverse Laplace transform of $G(s)$. Derivatives of the Dirac delta distribution, $\\delta^{(k)}(t)$, appear in $g(t)$ whenever $G(s)$ contains polynomial terms in $s$, since $\\mathcal{L}\\{\\delta^{(k)}(t)\\} = s^k$ for $k \\ge 0$.\n\nThe given system matrices $E$ and $A$ are block-diagonal, separating the system into a dynamic part and an algebraic part. Let $x_1$ be the dynamic state and $x_{alg} = [x_2, x_3]^T$ be the algebraic states.\n$E = \\text{diag}(E_1, E_{22})$, $A = \\text{diag}(A_1, A_{22})$ where $E_1=1$, $A_1=-2$, and\n$E_{sub} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{bmatrix}$, $A_{sub} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\nThe algebraic subsystem is of the form $E_{sub} \\dot{x}_{alg} = A_{sub} x_{alg} + B_{alg} u(t)$. This is the structure corresponding to a nilpotent block of index $2$.\n\nThe equations for the algebraic part are:\n$$\\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\dot{x}_2(t) \\\\ \\dot{x}_3(t) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x_2(t) \\\\ x_3(t) \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} b_2 \\\\ b_3 \\end{bmatrix} u(t)$$\nThis expands to:\n1. $\\dot{x}_3(t) = x_2(t) + b_2 u(t)$\n2. $0 = x_3(t) + b_3 u(t)$\n\nThe second equation is a purely algebraic constraint. If $b_3 \\neq 0$, we can express $x_3(t)$ directly in terms of the input:\n$$x_3(t) = -b_3 u(t)$$\nDifferentiating this with respect to time gives:\n$$\\dot{x}_3(t) = -b_3 \\dot{u}(t)$$\nSubstituting this into the first equation allows us to solve for $x_2(t)$:\n$$-b_3 \\dot{u}(t) = x_2(t) + b_2 u(t) \\implies x_2(t) = -b_3 \\dot{u}(t) - b_2 u(t)$$\nThe algebraic states $x_2(t)$ and $x_3(t)$ are thus expressed as linear combinations of the input $u(t)$ and its derivative $\\dot{u}(t)$.\nThe output contribution from these states is $y_{alg}(t) = c_2 x_2(t) + c_3 x_3(t)$. Substituting the expressions for $x_2(t)$ and $x_3(t)$:\n$$y_{alg}(t) = c_2(-b_3 \\dot{u}(t) - b_2 u(t)) + c_3(-b_3 u(t)) = -c_2 b_3 \\dot{u}(t) - (c_2 b_2 + c_3 b_3)u(t)$$\nIn the Laplace domain, this corresponds to a transfer function for the algebraic part:\n$$G_{alg}(s) = -c_2 b_3 s - (c_2 b_2 + c_3 b_3)$$\nThis is a polynomial in $s$. The term $-c_2 b_3 s$ in the transfer function gives rise to a derivative of a delta, $-c_2 b_3 \\delta'(t)$, in the impulse response. This justifies how algebraic constraints induce polynomial terms in the frequency domain, which invert to distributional terms in the time domain.\n\n**Task 2: Computation of the Impulse Response**\n\nFor the specific system given, we have $B = [1, 0, 1]^T$ and $C = [3, 1, 2]$. Thus, $b_1=1, b_2=0, b_3=1$ and $c_1=3, c_2=1, c_3=2$. The scalar $D=0$.\n\nWe analyze the system by decomposing it into its constituent equations:\n$$E\\dot{x} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\dot{x}_1 \\\\ \\dot{x}_3 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\qquad Ax+Bu = \\begin{bmatrix} -2x_1+u \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3+u \\end{bmatrix}$$\nEquating these gives:\n1. (Dynamic Part) $\\dot{x}_1(t) = -2x_1(t) + u(t)$\n2. (Algebraic Part) $\\dot{x}_3(t) = x_2(t)$\n3. (Algebraic Part) $0 = x_3(t) + u(t)$\n\nFrom the algebraic constraint (3), we find $x_3(t)$:\n$$x_3(t) = -u(t)$$\nDifferentiating with respect to time yields $\\dot{x}_3(t) = -\\dot{u}(t)$. Substituting this into equation (2) gives $x_2(t)$:\n$$x_2(t) = -\\dot{u}(t)$$\n\nThe output $y(t)$ is given by $y(t) = Cx(t) = 3x_1(t) + 1x_2(t) + 2x_3(t)$. Substituting the expressions for $x_2(t)$ and $x_3(t)$:\n$$y(t) = 3x_1(t) - \\dot{u}(t) - 2u(t)$$\nThe impulse response $g(t)$ is the output $y(t)$ when the input is the Dirac delta distribution, $u(t)=\\delta(t)$.\nThe response of the dynamic part, $x_1(t)$, to the input $u(t)=\\delta(t)$ is its own impulse response, $h_1(t)$. For the equation $\\dot{x}_1+2x_1=\\delta(t)$, the solution is $x_1(t) = e^{-2t}H(t)$.\nFor the distributional terms, we have $u(t) = \\delta(t)$ and $\\dot{u}(t) = \\delta'(t)$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $y(t)$ gives the overall impulse response $g(t)$:\n$$g(t) = 3(e^{-2t}H(t)) - \\delta'(t) - 2\\delta(t)$$\nThe term $3e^{-2t}H(t)$ arises from the dynamic part of the system. The terms $-\\delta'(t) - 2\\delta(t)$ arise from the algebraic constraints.\n\nTo verify, we can compute the transfer function $G(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\}$:\n$$G(s) = 3\\mathcal{L}\\{e^{-2t}H(t)\\} - \\mathcal{L}\\{\\delta'(t)\\} - 2\\mathcal{L}\\{\\delta(t)\\} = \\frac{3}{s+2} - s - 2$$\nThis result is consistent.\n\n**Task 3: Condition for the Appearance of $\\delta'(t)$**\n\nBased on the general derivation in Task 1, the output contains a term proportional to $\\dot{u}(t)$:\n$$y(t) = (\\dots) - c_2 b_3 \\dot{u}(t) + (\\dots)$$\nThe impulse response $g(t)$ is the output for $u(t)=\\delta(t)$, so this term becomes $-c_2 b_3 \\delta'(t)$.\nFor a $\\delta'(t)$ term to be present in the impulse response, its coefficient must be non-zero.\nIn the canonical structure given by matrices $E$ and $A$, the state $x_2$ is proportional to the derivative of the input, provided that the input directly affects the algebraic constraint on $x_3$. This occurs when $b_3 \\neq 0$. The derivative term then appears in the output if this state $x_2$ is observed, which occurs when $c_2 \\neq 0$.\nTherefore, the necessary and sufficient condition for a $\\delta'(t)$ term to appear in the impulse response is that the product of these coefficients is non-zero:\n$$c_2 b_3 \\neq 0$$\nFor the specific system problem, $c_2=1$ and $b_3=1$, so the condition $1 \\cdot 1 \\neq 0$ is met, which is why a $\\delta'(t)$ term appears in our calculated response.\n\nThe final answer is the explicit closed-form expression for the impulse response $g(t)$.\n$$g(t) = 3e^{-2t}H(t) - 2\\delta(t) - \\delta'(t)$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3\\exp(-2t)H(t) - 2\\delta(t) - \\delta'(t)}\n$$", "id": "2712284"}]}
