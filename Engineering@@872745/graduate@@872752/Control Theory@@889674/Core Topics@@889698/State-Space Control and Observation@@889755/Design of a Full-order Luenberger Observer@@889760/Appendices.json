It is a standard problem in linear control theory. Thus, the problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis is partitioned into the three tasks specified in the problem statement.\n\nTask $1$: Observability and Detectability Analysis\n\nFirst, we determine if the pair $(A,C)$ is observable. A system is completely observable if and only if the observability matrix $\\mathcal{O}$ has full column rank, which is $n=3$ in this case. The observability matrix for a system of dimension $n$ is given by\n$$\n\\mathcal{O} = \\begin{pmatrix} C \\\\ CA \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ CA^{n-1} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor this system, $n=3$, so we need to compute $C$, $CA$, and $CA^2$. The given matrices are:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad C = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe compute the products:\n$$\nCA = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nA^2 = A \\cdot A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nCA^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe observability matrix is therefore\n$$\n\\mathcal{O} = \\begin{pmatrix} C \\\\ CA \\\\ CA^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0 \\\\ 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe rank of $\\mathcal{O}$ is $\\text{rank}(\\mathcal{O}) = 2$, which is less than the state dimension $n=3$. Therefore, the system is **not observable**.\n\nNext, we determine if the pair $(A,C)$ is detectable. A system is detectable if all of its unobservable modes are asymptotically stable. We can identify the unobservable modes using the Popov-Hautus-Belevitch (PHB) test. An eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of $A$ corresponds to an unobservable mode if and only if $\\text{rank} \\begin{pmatrix} A - \\lambda I \\\\ C \\end{pmatrix}  n$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of $A$ are its diagonal entries, as $A$ is an upper triangular matrix: $\\lambda_1 = 0$ (with algebraic multiplicity $2$) and $\\lambda_2 = -1$.\n\nLet's test each eigenvalue:\nFor $\\lambda = 0$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} A - 0I \\\\ C \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  -1 \\\\ \\hline 1  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix has rank $3$, as can be seen from the non-zero determinant of the submatrix formed by rows $1$, $3$, and $4$: $\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  -1 \\\\ 1  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} = -1 \\neq 0$. Thus, the modes associated with $\\lambda=0$ are observable.\n\nFor $\\lambda = -1$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} A - (-1)I \\\\ C \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  0 \\\\ 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ \\hline 1  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe third row is all zeros, so the rank of this $4 \\times 3$ matrix is at most $2$. For instance, the first two rows are linearly independent, so the rank is exactly $2$. Since $\\text{rank}\\begin{pmatrix} A - (-1)I \\\\ C \\end{pmatrix} = 2  3$, the mode corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = -1$ is unobservable.\n\nThe only unobservable mode is $\\lambda = -1$. According to the definition of detectability, we check if this mode is asymptotically stable. A mode $\\lambda$ is asymptotically stable if $\\text{Re}(\\lambda)  0$. Here, $\\text{Re}(-1) = -1  0$. Since the only unobservable mode is asymptotically stable, the system is **detectable**.\n\nTask $2$: Observer Error Dynamics\n\nThe system and observer dynamics are given by:\n$$\n\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\quad (\\text{general system})\n$$\n$$\ny = Cx\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{\\hat{x}} = A \\hat{x} + L(y - C \\hat{x})\n$$\nThe problem statement correctly indicates that the term $Bu$ from the plant dynamics is handled in the full observer equation $\\dot{\\hat{x}} = A\\hat{x} + Bu + L(y - C\\hat{x})$, which simplifies the error dynamics derivation. The estimation error is defined as $e(t) = x(t) - \\hat{x}(t)$. Its derivative is $\\dot{e} = \\dot{x} - \\dot{\\hat{x}}$. Substituting the system and observer equations (with the $Bu$ term included for completeness):\n$$\n\\dot{e} = (Ax + Bu) - (A\\hat{x} + Bu + L(y - C\\hat{x}))\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{e} = Ax - A\\hat{x} - L(Cx - C\\hat{x})\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{e} = A(x - \\hat{x}) - LC(x - \\hat{x})\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{e} = (A - LC)e\n$$\nThis is the linear time-invariant differential equation governing the error dynamics. The stability of the observer is determined by the eigenvalues of the matrix $A_{obs} = A - LC$. Let $L = \\begin{pmatrix} \\ell_1 \\\\ \\ell_2 \\\\ \\ell_3 \\end{pmatrix}$. We compute $A - LC$:\n$$\nA - LC = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} \\ell_1 \\\\ \\ell_2 \\\\ \\ell_3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nA - LC = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} \\ell_1  0  0 \\\\ \\ell_2  0  0 \\\\ \\ell_3  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\ell_1  1  0 \\\\ -\\ell_2  0  0 \\\\ -\\ell_3  0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of the error system are the roots of the characteristic polynomial $\\det(\\lambda I - (A - LC)) = 0$.\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda + \\ell_1  -1  0 \\\\ \\ell_2  \\lambda  0 \\\\ \\ell_3  0  \\lambda + 1 \\end{pmatrix} = (\\lambda + 1) \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda + \\ell_1  -1 \\\\ \\ell_2  \\lambda \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n= (\\lambda + 1) [(\\lambda + \\ell_1)\\lambda - (-1)\\ell_2] = (\\lambda + 1) (\\lambda^2 + \\ell_1 \\lambda + \\ell_2)\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of the error dynamics are $\\lambda = -1$ and the two roots of the quadratic equation $\\lambda^2 + \\ell_1 \\lambda + \\ell_2 = 0$. The eigenvalue at $-1$ is fixed and corresponds to the unobservable mode of the system. The other two eigenvalues can be placed arbitrarily by choosing $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$, since the pair $(A,C)$ is detectable. The gain component $\\ell_3$ does not influence the eigenvalues.\n\nTask $3$: Observer Gain Design\n\nWe are required to place the two movable observer error eigenvalues at $-2$ and $-3$. The desired characteristic polynomial for these two eigenvalues is:\n$$\n(\\lambda - (-2))(\\lambda - (-3)) = (\\lambda + 2)(\\lambda + 3) = \\lambda^2 + 5\\lambda + 6\n$$\nBy comparing the coefficients of this polynomial with the movable part of the observer's characteristic polynomial, $\\lambda^2 + \\ell_1 \\lambda + \\ell_2$, we find the values for $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$:\n$$\n\\ell_1 = 5\n$$\n$$\n\\ell_2 = 6\n$$\nThe total set of eigenvalues for the error dynamics is $\\{-1, -2, -3\\}$. Since all eigenvalues have negative real parts, the error dynamics are asymptotically stable, i.e., $e(t) \\to 0$ as $t \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe observer gain vector is $L = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 6 \\\\ \\ell_3 \\end{pmatrix}$. We must choose $\\ell_3$ to minimize the Euclidean norm of $L$, denoted $\\|L\\|_2$. The squared norm is:\n$$\n\\|L\\|_2^2 = \\ell_1^2 + \\ell_2^2 + \\ell_3^2 = 5^2 + 6^2 + \\ell_3^2 = 25 + 36 + \\ell_3^2 = 61 + \\ell_3^2\n$$\nTo minimize $\\|L\\|_2$, we must minimize $\\|L\\|_2^2$. The expression $61 + \\ell_3^2$ is a simple quadratic in $\\ell_3$, which achieves its minimum value when $\\ell_3^2$ is minimal. As $\\ell_3$ is a real number, the minimum value of $\\ell_3^2$ is $0$, which occurs at $\\ell_3 = 0$.\nThus, the gain vector that satisfies all conditions is $L = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $\\ell_1 + \\ell_2$.\n$$\n\\ell_1 + \\ell_2 = 5 + 6 = 11\n$$\nThis is the final numerical result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{11}$$", "id": "2699844"}, {"introduction": "With an understanding of the conditions for observer design, we now turn to the fundamental mechanics of pole placement.

The core task is to design an observer by pole placement. A necessary and sufficient condition for the arbitrary placement of observer error eigenvalues is that the system must be completely observable. The observability of the pair $(A, C)$ is determined by the rank of the observability matrix $\\mathcal{O}$.\nThe observability matrix is constructed as $\\mathcal{O} = \\begin{bmatrix} C \\\\ CA \\end{bmatrix}$.\nWe compute the product $CA$:\n$$\nCA = \\begin{bmatrix} 1  0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1  2 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1  2 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe observability matrix is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathcal{O} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 1  2 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of $\\mathcal{O}$ is $\\det(\\mathcalO) = (1)(2) - (0)(1) = 2$. Since $\\det(\\mathcal{O}) \\neq 0$, the matrix has full rank, which is $2$. The system state dimension is $n=2$, so the system is completely observable. This guarantees that a gain matrix $L$ exists that can place the eigenvalues of the error dynamics at any desired location. The problem is thus scientifically grounded, well-posed, and complete.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid. A solution will be constructed.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nFirst, we derive the dynamics of the estimation error $e(t) = x(t) - \\hat{x}(t)$.

The desired characteristic polynomial, $\\alpha_{des}(s)$, is formed from these poles:\n$$\n\\alpha_{des}(s) = \\left(s - (-3+j)\\right) \\left(s - (-3-j)\\right) = (s+3-j)(s+3+j)\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_{des}(s) = (s+3)^2 - j^2 = (s+3)^2 + 1 = s^2 + 6s + 9 + 1 = s^2 + 6s + 10\n$$\nNext, we find the actual characteristic polynomial of the error dynamics matrix, $(A-LC)$, in terms of the unknown observer gain $L$. As the state dimension is $n=2$ and the output dimension is $p=1$, the gain $L$ is a $2 \\times 1$ column vector. Let $L = \\begin{bmatrix} l_1 \\\\ l_2 \\end{bmatrix}$.\nFirst, compute the matrix product $LC$:\n$$\nLC = \\begin{bmatrix} l_1 \\\\ l_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1  0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} l_1  0 \\\\ l_2  0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNow, compute the error system matrix $(A-LC)$:\n$$\nA-LC = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ -5  -6 \\end{bmatrix} - \\begin{bmatrix} l_1  0 \\\\ l_2  0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -l_1  1 \\\\ -5-l_2  -6 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe actual characteristic polynomial, $\\alpha_{act}(s)$, is the determinant of $(sI - (A-LC))$:\n$$\n\\alpha_{act}(s) = \\det\\left( s\\begin{bmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{bmatrix} - \\begin{bmatrix} -l_1  1 \\\\ -5-l_2  -6 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\det\\begin{bmatrix} s+l_1  -1 \\\\ 5+l_2  s+6 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_{act}(s) = (s+l_1)(s+6) - (-1)(5+l_2) = s^2 + 6s + l_1s + 6l_1 + 5 + l_2\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_{act}(s) = s^2 + (6+l_1)s + (6l_1 + l_2 + 5)\n$$\nTo achieve the desired pole placement, we equate the coefficients of the actual and desired characteristic polynomials: $\\alpha_{act}(s) = \\alpha_{des}(s)$.\n$$\ns^2 + (6+l_1)s + (6l_1 + l_2 + 5) = s^2 + 6s + 10\n$$\nBy comparing the coefficients for each power of $s$, we obtain a system of linear equations for $l_1$ and $l_2$:\nComparing coefficients of $s^1$:\n$$\n6+l_1 = 6 \\implies l_1 = 0\n$$\nComparing coefficients of $s^0$ (constant terms):\n$$\n6l_1 + l_2 + 5 = 10\n$$\nSubstituting the value $l_1=0$ into the second equation:\n$$\n6(0) + l_2 + 5 = 10 \\implies l_2 + 5 = 10 \\implies l_2 = 5\n$$\nThus, the computed observer gain is $L = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 5 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nThis result can be validated using the principle of duality. The pole placement problem for an observer with system pair $(A, C)$ is dual to the state feedback control problem for a system with pair $(A^T, C^T)$. The eigenvalues of $(A-LC)$ are identical to the eigenvalues of its transpose, $(A-LC)^T = A^T - C^T L^T$. Finding $L$ for the observer is equivalent to finding a state feedback gain $K=L^T$ for the dual system $\\dot{z} = A^T z + C^T v$ under control $v = -Kz$. Since $(A,C)$ is observable, the dual pair $(A^T, C^T)$ is controllable, and Ackermann's formula can be used to find $K=L^T$.\nFor the dual system, $L^T = K = [0 \\dots 1] (\\mathcal{C}_{dual})^{-1} \\alpha_{des}(A^T)$, where $\\mathcal{C}_{dual}$ is the controllability matrix of $(A^T, C^T)$, which is $\\mathcal{O}^T$.\nWe found $\\mathcal{O} = I$, so $(\\mathcal{C}_{dual})^{-1} = (I^T)^{-1} = I$.\n$A^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  -5 \\\\ 1  -6 \\end{bmatrix}$. The desired characteristic polynomial is $\\alpha_{des}(s) = s^2 + 6s + 10$.\nWe evaluate $\\alpha_{des}(A^T) = (A^T)^2 + 6A^T + 10I$:\n$$\n(A^T)^2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  -5 \\\\ 1  -6 \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} 0  -5 \\\\ 1  -6 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -5  30 \\\\ -6  31 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n6A^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  -30 \\\\ 6  -36 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n10I = \\begin{bmatrix} 10  0 \\\\ 0  10 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_{des}(A^T) = \\begin{bmatrix} -5  30 \\\\ -6  31 \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} 0  -30 \\\\ 6  -36 \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} 10  0 \\\\ 0  10 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 5  0 \\\\ 0  5 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNow we compute $L^T$:\n$$\nL^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\end{bmatrix} I \\begin{bmatrix} 5  0 \\\\ 0  5 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 5  0 \\\\ 0  5 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  5 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nTransposing back gives $L = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 5 \\end{bmatrix}$, confirming our previous result. The components of the observer gain are $l_1=0$ and $l_2=5$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0  5 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2699843"}]}
