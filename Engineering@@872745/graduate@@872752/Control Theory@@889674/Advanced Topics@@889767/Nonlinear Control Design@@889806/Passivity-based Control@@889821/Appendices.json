The system description is a standard first-order model. The definition of passivity, the specified storage function, and the input scaling are all well-defined mathematical concepts. The problem is objective and all terms are formally defined or standard in the field. The givens are self-contained and not contradictory. The phrasing regarding \"shortage of passivity\" and \"high-frequency input gain\" is unconventional but is given a precise mathematical meaning through the equation $b = 1 - \\nu$, which serves as a definition for the parameter $b$ in terms of $\\nu$. The problem is well-posed, as it seeks a condition on a parameter $k$ for a specific property to hold. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe original system is given by the state-space equations:\n$$ \\dot{x} = -a\\,x + b\\,u $$\n$$ y = x $$\nA static input scaling is applied, $u = k\\,v$, where $k>0$ is a constant gain and $v$ is the new input. Substituting this into the state equation yields the dynamics of the scaled system:\n$$ \\dot{x} = -a\\,x + b(k\\,v) = -a\\,x + (bk)v $$\nThe output remains $y=x$. We are tasked to assess the passivity of the map from the input $v$ to the output $y$. The definition of passivity requires the existence of a storage function $V(x)$ such that its time derivative along the system trajectories satisfies $\\dot{V} \\le yv$. The problem explicitly mandates the use of the candidate storage function $V(x) = \\tfrac{1}{2}x^{2}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the time derivative of the specified storage function $V(x)$ along the trajectories of the scaled system:\n$$ \\dot{V}(x) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x^2\\right) = x\\dot{x} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\dot{x}$:\n$$ \\dot{V}(x) = x(-a\\,x + bkv) = -ax^2 + bkxv $$\nThe passivity condition is $\\dot{V} \\le yv$. Since $y=x$, this condition becomes:\n$$ -ax^2 + bkxv \\le xv $$\nThis inequality must hold for the system to be passive with the given storage function. Rearranging the terms, we obtain the necessary and sufficient condition on $k$:\n$$ ax^2 + (1 - bk)xv \\ge 0 $$\nThis inequality must be satisfied for any input signal $v(t)$ and the corresponding state trajectory $x(t)$. For a controllable system such as this one, this is equivalent to the inequality holding for all pairs of real numbers $(x, v) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nThe expression $f(x,v) = ax^2 + (1-bk)xv$ is a quadratic form in the variables $x$ and $v$. We can represent this form using a symmetric matrix $Q$ such that $f(x,v) = \\begin{pmatrix} x  v \\end{pmatrix} Q \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ v \\end{pmatrix}$. The matrix $Q$ is:\n$$ Q = \\begin{pmatrix} a  \\frac{1-bk}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1-bk}{2}  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe condition $f(x,v) \\ge 0$ for all $(x,v)$ requires the matrix $Q$ to be positive semi-definite. According to Sylvester's criterion for a $2 \\times 2$ matrix, this requires the leading principal minors of $Q$ to be non-negative.\n1. The first principal minor is the top-left element, which is $a$. We are given $a>0$, so this condition is satisfied.\n2. The second principal minor is the determinant of $Q$.\n$$ \\det(Q) = (a)(0) - \\left(\\frac{1-bk}{2}\\right)^2 = -\\frac{(1-bk)^2}{4} $$\nFor $Q$ to be positive semi-definite, we must have $\\det(Q) \\ge 0$.\n$$ -\\frac{(1-bk)^2}{4} \\ge 0 $$\nSince $(1-bk)^2$ is the square of a real number, it is always non-negative. Therefore, the expression $-\\frac{(1-bk)^2}{4}$ is always non-positive. The only way for it to satisfy the condition $\\ge 0$ is for it to be exactly zero.\n$$ (1-bk)^2 = 0 $$\nThis implies:\n$$ 1 - bk = 0 $$\nThis yields a unique value for $k$:\n$$ k = \\frac{1}{b} $$\nThe problem asks for a \"necessary and sufficient inequality on $k$\". The derived condition $k = 1/b$ is both necessary and sufficient. This can be viewed as the limit of an inequality, defining a set of admissible $k$ values that contains only a single point.\n\nThe problem then asks for the largest admissible positive $k$. Since the set of admissible values for $k$ is the singleton $\\{\\frac{1}{b}\\}$, the largest value is trivially $\\frac{1}{b}$.\n\nWe are given that $b = 1 - \\nu$, where $\\nu  0$. Substituting this into our expression for $k$:\n$$ k = \\frac{1}{1-\\nu} $$\nSince $\\nu  0$, the denominator $1-\\nu$ is greater than $1$, which ensures that $k$ is positive, as required by the problem statement ($k>0$).\n\nThus, the largest (and only) admissible value of $k$ that guarantees passivity of the scaled system with the specified storage function is $\\frac{1}{1-\\nu}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{1}{1-\\nu}} $$", "id": "2730776"}, {"introduction": "The primary motivation for using passivity is its elegant compositional property: the feedback interconnection of passive systems is guaranteed to be stable.
