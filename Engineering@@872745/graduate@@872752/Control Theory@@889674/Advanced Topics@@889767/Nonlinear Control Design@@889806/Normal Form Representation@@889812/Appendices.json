It presents a standard problem in linear control theory, free of contradictions or ambiguities. I will therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part analysis of the Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) transfer function $G(s)=\\dfrac{s^{2}+2s+3}{s^{3}+4s^{2}+5s+6}$.\n\nFirst, we construct the controllable companion form (also known as the controller canonical form) from first principles.\n\nLet the numerator polynomial be $N(s) = b_2 s^{2} + b_1 s + b_0 = s^2+2s+3$ and the denominator polynomial be $D(s) = s^3+a_2 s^2+a_1 s+a_0 = s^{3}+4s^{2}+5s+6$. The order of the system is $n=3$.\nThe relationship between the Laplace transforms of the input, $U(s)$, and the output, $Y(s)$, is given by $Y(s)=G(s)U(s)$.\nWe can write this as $D(s)Y(s) = N(s)U(s)$. This form is difficult to work with directly. Instead, we introduce an auxiliary variable $Z(s)$ such that:\n$$U(s) = D(s)Z(s)$$\n$$Y(s) = N(s)Z(s)$$\nSubstituting the polynomials, we have:\n$$(s^3+4s^2+5s+6)Z(s) = U(s)$$\n$$(s^2+2s+3)Z(s) = Y(s)$$\nWe can convert the first equation into a time-domain ordinary differential equation, where $z(t)$ is the inverse Laplace transform of $Z(s)$:\n$$\\frac{d^3z}{dt^3} + 4\\frac{d^2z}{dt^2} + 5\\frac{dz}{dt} + 6z(t) = u(t)$$\nTo establish a state-space model, we define the state variables $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ as follows, which is characteristic for the controllable companion form:\n$$x_1 = z(t)$$\n$$x_2 = \\dot{x}_1 = \\frac{dz}{dt}$$\n$$x_3 = \\dot{x}_2 = \\frac{d^2z}{dt^2}$$\nFrom these definitions, we obtain the first two state equations:\n$$\\dot{x}_1 = x_2$$\n$$\\dot{x}_2 = x_3$$\nThe third state equation is derived by rearranging the differential equation for $z(t)$:\n$$\\dot{x}_3 = \\frac{d^3z}{dt^3} = -6z - 5\\frac{dz}{dt} - 4\\frac{d^2z}{dt^2} + u(t)$$\nSubstituting the state variables, we get:\n$$\\dot{x}_3 = -6x_1 - 5x_2 - 4x_3 + u(t)$$\nThese three equations can be written in matrix form, $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = A\\mathbf{x} + B u$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} \\dot{x}_1 \\\\ \\dot{x}_2 \\\\ \\dot{x}_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\\\ -6  -5  -4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} u(t) $$\nThis gives the state matrix $A$ and the input matrix $B$:\n$$A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\\\ -6  -5  -4 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nNext, we derive the output equation $y = C\\mathbf{x} + Du$. From $Y(s) = (s^2+2s+3)Z(s)$, we find the time-domain output $y(t)$:\n$$y(t) = \\frac{d^2z}{dt^2} + 2\\frac{dz}{dt} + 3z(t)$$\nSubstituting the state variables:\n$$y(t) = x_3 + 2x_2 + 3x_1$$\nThis gives the output matrix $C$ in the equation $y = C\\mathbf{x}$:\n$$C = \\begin{pmatrix} 3  2  1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nSince the degree of the numerator $N(s)$ is less than the degree of the denominator $D(s)$ (i.e., the transfer function is strictly proper), the direct feedthrough term $D$ is zero. Thus, the controllable companion form realization is $(A, B, C, D)$ with $A$, $B$, $C$ as derived and $D=0$.\n\nSecond, we must justify that this realization is minimal. A realization is minimal if and only if it is both controllable and observable. This is equivalent to the condition that there are no pole-zero cancellations in the transfer function $G(s)$, which means the polynomials $N(s)$ and $D(s)$ are coprime. We use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $N(s)=s^2+2s+3$ and $D(s)=s^3+4s^2+5s+6$.\nWe perform polynomial division of $D(s)$ by $N(s)$:\n$$ (s^3+4s^2+5s+6) = (s+2)(s^2+2s+3) + (-2s) $$\nThe remainder is $R_1(s) = -2s$.\nNext, we divide the previous divisor, $N(s)$, by the remainder, $R_1(s)$:\n$$ (s^2+2s+3) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}s - 1\\right)(-2s) + 3 $$\nThe remainder is $R_2(s) = 3$.\nSince the last non-zero remainder, $3$, is a constant, the greatest common divisor of $N(s)$ and $D(s)$ is a constant. Therefore, the polynomials are coprime. This lack of common factors implies there are no pole-zero cancellations, and thus any $3$-dimensional realization, including the one we have constructed, must be minimal. A property of the controller canonical form is that it is always controllable. The coprimeness of $N(s)$ and $D(s)$ ensures it is also observable, hence minimal.\n\nThird, we verify the controllability of the constructed realization $(A, B)$ using the Kalman rank condition. The system is controllable if and only if the controllability matrix $\\mathcal{C}$ has full rank, which for a system of order $n=3$ means $\\text{rank}(\\mathcal{C}) = 3$.\nThe controllability matrix is defined as $\\mathcal{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} B  AB  A^2B \\end{pmatrix}$.\nWe have $B$ and $A$:\n$$ B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\\\ -6  -5  -4 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe compute the necessary matrix products:\n$$ AB = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\\\ -6  -5  -4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -4 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ A^2B = A(AB) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\\\ -6  -5  -4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -4 \\\\ -5 + 16 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -4 \\\\ 11 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow we construct the controllability matrix $\\mathcal{C}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  1 \\\\ 0  1  -4 \\\\ 1  -4  11 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nTo find the rank, we can compute the determinant of $\\mathcal{C}$. A non-zero determinant implies the matrix has full rank.\n$$ \\det(\\mathcal{C}) = 0 \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1  -4 \\\\ -4  11 \\end{pmatrix} - 0 \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 0  -4 \\\\ 1  11 \\end{pmatrix} + 1 \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  -4 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\det(\\mathcal{C}) = 1 \\cdot (0 \\cdot (-4) - 1 \\cdot 1) = -1 $$\nSince $\\det(\\mathcal{C}) = -1 \\neq 0$, the matrix $\\mathcal{C}$ is nonsingular and thus has full rank.\nThe rank of the controllability matrix is $3$, which is equal to the order of the system. This confirms that the system is controllable, as expected for a canonical form that is correctly constructed. The final answer required is the rank of this matrix.\nThe rank is $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "2728128"}, {"introduction": "While companion forms are convenient for realization, the Jordan Normal Form (JCF) provides the deepest insight into a system's inherent structure, especially for non-diagonalizable systems.

The condition $(A - 4I)v = 0$ implies $y = 0$ and $z = 0$. The eigenvectors are of the form $v = c \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ for any non-zero scalar $c$. The null space, or eigenspace, is one-dimensional. The geometric multiplicity is $m_g = \\dim(\\ker(A-4I))=1$. Since $m_g = 1  m_a = 3$, the matrix $A$ is not diagonalizable. It possesses a single Jordan block of size $3$. The Jordan Canonical Form (JCF) must be:\n$$ J = \\begin{bmatrix} 4  1  0\\\\ 0  4  1\\\\ 0  0  4 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nThus, the matrix $A$ is already in its Jordan canonical form, so $J=A$.\n\nTo construct a Jordan chain of generalized eigenvectors $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$, we seek vectors satisfying:\n$1. \\ (A-4I)v_1 = 0$ ($v_1$ is a standard eigenvector).\n$2. \\ (A-4I)v_2 = v_1$ ($v_2$ is a generalized eigenvector of rank $2$).\n$3. \\ (A-4I)v_3 = v_2$ ($v_3$ is a generalized eigenvector of rank $3$).\nThis chain is typically constructed \"backwards,\" starting from $v_3$. We must find a vector $v_3$ such that $(A-4I)^2 v_3 \\neq 0$ but $(A-4I)^3 v_3 = 0$.\nFirst, we compute the powers of $(A-4I)$:\n$$ (A-4I)^2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1  0\\\\ 0  0  1\\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1  0\\\\ 0  0  1\\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  0  1\\\\ 0  0  0\\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n$$ (A-4I)^3 = (A-4I)^2 (A-4I) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  0  1\\\\ 0  0  0\\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1  0\\\\ 0  0  1\\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  0  0\\\\ 0  0  0\\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nThe condition $(A-4I)^3 v_3 = 0$ holds for any $v_3 \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. The condition $(A-4I)^2 v_3 \\neq 0$ means that the third component of $v_3$ must be non-zero. Let us choose the simplest such vector, $v_3 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. This vector is the \"tail\" of the chain, also called the last generalized eigenvector.\nNow, we generate the rest of the chain:\n$$ v_2 = (A-4I)v_3 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1  0\\\\ 0  0  1\\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n$$ v_1 = (A-4I)v_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1  0\\\\ 0  0  1\\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nThe vector $v_1$ is the standard eigenvector, the \"head\" of the chain. The ordered Jordan chain is $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\} = \\left\\{ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\right\\}$. These are the standard basis vectors.\n\nNow, we explain the connection to controllability. Consider the system $\\dot{x} = Ax+bu$. We perform a change of coordinates $x=Pz$, where the columns of $P$ are the vectors of the Jordan chain, $P=[v_1, v_2, v_3]$. In these new coordinates $z$, the system dynamics are $\\dot{z} = Jz + \\hat{b}$, where $J=P^{-1}AP$ is the JCF and $\\hat{b}=P^{-1}b$ is the input vector in the Jordan basis. The components of $z$, denoted $z_i$, are the coordinates of the state along the generalized eigenvectors $v_i$.\nFor a single Jordan block of size $3$, the equations are:\n$$ \\dot{z}_1 = \\lambda z_1 + z_2 + \\hat{b}_1 u $$\n$$ \\dot{z}_2 = \\lambda z_2 + z_3 + \\hat{b}_2 u $$\n$$ \\dot{z}_3 = \\lambda z_3 + \\hat{b}_3 u $$\nHere, $\\lambda=4$. Observe the cascaded structure. The input $u$ directly influences the dynamics of $z_3$ only if $\\hat{b}_3 \\neq 0$. If $\\hat{b}_3 = 0$, the equation for $z_3$ becomes $\\dot{z}_3 = \\lambda z_3$, whose solution is decoupled from the input $u$. The state $z_3$ is uncontrollable. Because $z_3$ acts as an internal, uncontrollable input to the dynamics of $z_2$, the state $z_2$ also becomes uncontrollable. This effect propagates up the chain to $z_1$. Therefore, to control the entire state vector $z$, and thus $x$, it is necessary that the input can influence the \"end\" of the chain, which requires $\\hat{b}_3 \\neq 0$. The term $\\hat{b}_3$ is the component of the input vector $b$ corresponding to the last vector in the Jordan chain, $v_3$.\n\nThe Kalman rank condition states that the pair $(A,b)$ is controllable if and only if the controllability matrix $\\mathcal{C} = [b \\ | \\ Ab \\ | \\dots \\ | \\ A^{n-1}b]$ has full rank, i.e., $\\text{rank}(\\mathcal{C})=n$. As shown through the coordinate transformation $x=Pz$, we have $\\mathcal{C} = P\\hat{\\mathcal{C}}$, where $\\hat{\\mathcal{C}} = [\\hat{b} \\ | \\ J\\hat{b} \\ | \\dots \\ | \\ J^{n-1}\\hat{b}]$. Since $P$ is invertible, $\\text{rank}(\\mathcal{C})=\\text{rank}(\\hat{\\mathcal{C}})$. If $\\hat{b}_3 = 0$, the last row of $\\hat{\\mathcal{C}}$ can be shown to be entirely zero, making the matrix rank-deficient. Thus, the condition $\\hat{b}_3 \\neq 0$ is equivalent to the Kalman rank condition.\n\nFinally, we compute the determinant of the controllability matrix for the given $A$ and $b=\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\0\\\\1\\end{bmatrix}$. The controllability matrix is $\\mathcal{C} = [b \\ | \\ Ab \\ | \\ A^2b]$.\nWe calculate the columns:\n$b = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n$Ab = \\begin{bmatrix} 4  1  0\\\\ 0  4  1\\\\ 0  0  4 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 4 \\end{bmatrix}$\n$A^2b = A(Ab) = \\begin{bmatrix} 4  1  0\\\\ 0  4  1\\\\ 0  0  4 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 4 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 4+4 \\\\ 16 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 8 \\\\ 16 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe controllability matrix is:\n$$ \\mathcal{C} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  0  1 \\\\ 0  1  8 \\\\ 1  4  16 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nWe compute its determinant by cofactor expansion along the first row:\n$$ \\det(\\mathcal{C}) = 0 \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1  8 \\\\ 4  16 \\end{pmatrix} - 0 \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 0  8 \\\\ 1  16 \\end{pmatrix} + 1 \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  4 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\det(\\mathcal{C}) = 1 \\cdot (0 \\cdot 4 - 1 \\cdot 1) = -1 $$\nThe determinant is non-zero, confirming that the system is controllable, consistent with our earlier reasoning since for this choice of basis ($P=I$), we have $\\hat{b}=b$ and $\\hat{b}_3=1 \\neq 0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1}$$", "id": "2728068"}, {"introduction": "Normal forms are not only for analyzing known systems but are also essential for constructing models from experimental data.

The transfer function for this canonical form is:\n$$G(z) = C_c(zI-A_c)^{-1}B_c = \\frac{c_2 z + c_1}{z^2 - \\frac{1}{6}z - \\frac{1}{6}}$$\nExpanding $G(z)$ as a series in $z^{-1}$:\n$$G(z) = \\frac{c_2 z^{-1} + c_1 z^{-2}}{1 - \\frac{1}{6}z^{-1} - \\frac{1}{6}z^{-2}} = c_2 z^{-1} + \\left(c_1 + \\frac{c_2}{6}\\right)z^{-2} + O(z^{-3})$$\nComparing coefficients with $G(z) = h_1 z^{-1} + h_2 z^{-2} + \\dots$:\n$h_1 = c_2$\n$h_2 = c_1 + \\frac{c_2}{6}$\nUsing the given values $h_1=5$ and $h_2=0$:\n$c_2 = 5$.\n$0 = c_1 + \\frac{5}{6} \\implies c_1 = -\\frac{5}{6}$.\nThus, the output matrix is $C_c = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{5}{6}  5 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe minimal partial realization is:\n$$A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ \\frac{1}{6}  \\frac{1}{6} \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad C = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{5}{6}  5 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nPart 3: Verification of Consistency\nThe consistency of the sequence is verified by confirming it satisfies the recurrence induced by the realization. By the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, the matrix $A$ satisfies its own characteristic equation: $A^2 - \\frac{1}{6}A - \\frac{1}{6}I = 0$.\nMultiplying by $C$ on the left and $A^{k-1}B$ on the right gives:\n$C A^{k+1} B - \\frac{1}{6} C A^k B - \\frac{1}{6} C A^{k-1} B = 0$.\nUsing the definition of Markov parameters, $h_m = C A^{m-1} B$, this equation becomes:\n$h_{k+2} - \\frac{1}{6} h_{k+1} - \\frac{1}{6} h_k = 0$.\nThis is precisely the recurrence relation $h_{k+2} = \\frac{1}{6}(h_{k+1} + h_k)$, which was already confirmed in Part 1 to hold for all available indices ($k=1, \\dots, 8$). This demonstrates the consistency of the given sequence with the constructed second-order model.\n\nPart 4: Computation of $h_{11}$\nThe next Markov parameter, $h_{11}$, is predicted by the recurrence relation for $k=9$:\n$$h_{11} = \\frac{1}{6}h_{10} + \\frac{1}{6}h_9$$\nSubstituting the given values for $h_9$ and $h_{10}$:\n$$h_{11} = \\frac{1}{6}\\left(\\frac{6305}{1679616}\\right) + \\frac{1}{6}\\left(\\frac{2315}{279936}\\right)$$\nTo compute this sum, we note that $1679616 = 6 \\times 279936$. We can therefore write the second term with the same denominator as the first:\n$$h_{11} = \\frac{1}{6}\\left(\\frac{6305}{1679616} + \\frac{2315 \\times 6}{1679616}\\right) = \\frac{1}{6}\\left(\\frac{6305 + 13890}{1679616}\\right) = \\frac{20195}{10077696}$$\nThe denominator is $10077696 = 6^9 = 2^9 \\cdot 3^9$. The numerator is $20195$, which ends in $5$, so it is divisible by $5$. The sum of its digits is $2+0+1+9+5 = 17$, so it is not divisible by $3$. It is also not divisible by $2$. Since the denominator's only prime factors are $2$ and $3$, the fraction is in its lowest terms.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{20195}{10077696}}$$", "id": "2728082"}]}
