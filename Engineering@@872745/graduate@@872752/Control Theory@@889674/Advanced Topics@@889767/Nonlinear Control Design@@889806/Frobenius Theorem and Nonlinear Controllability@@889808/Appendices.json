The vector fields are $X = \\partial_{x} + y\\,\\partial_{z}$ and $Y = \\partial_{y}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the Lie bracket $[X,Y]$.

First, the action of $X$ on $\\phi$ is:\n$$X(\\phi) = (\\partial_{x} + y\\,\\partial_{z})(\\phi) = \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial z}$$\nNow, we apply the vector field $Y$ to this result, using the product rule for differentiation on the second term:\n$$Y(X(\\phi)) = Y\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial z}\\right) = \\partial_{y}\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial z}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(y\\,\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial z}\\right)$$\n$$Y(X(\\phi)) = \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial y \\partial x} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial y}\\cdot\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial z} + y\\cdot\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial z}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$Y(X(\\phi)) = \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial y \\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial z} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial y \\partial z}$$\n\nNow we combine the two parts to find $[X,Y](\\phi)$:\n$$[X,Y](\\phi) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial x \\partial y} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial z \\partial y}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial y \\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial z} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial y \\partial z}\\right)$$\nSince $\\phi$ is a smooth function, its mixed partial derivatives are equal by Clairaut's theorem, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial y \\partial x}$ and $\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial z \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial y \\partial z}$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$[X,Y](\\phi) = \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial x \\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial y \\partial x} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial z \\partial y} - y\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial y \\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial z}$$\nThis result means that the Lie bracket operator $[X,Y]$ acts on any smooth function $\\phi$ as $-\\partial_{z}$. Therefore, the Lie bracket as a vector field is:\n$$[X,Y] = -\\partial_{z}$$\nThis can be written in the coordinate basis $\\{\\partial_{x}, \\partial_{y}, \\partial_{z}\\}$ as $0 \\cdot \\partial_{x} + 0 \\cdot \\partial_{y} - 1 \\cdot \\partial_{z}$.\n\nSecond, we determine if the distribution $\\mathcal{D} = \\mathrm{span}\\{X,Y\\}$ is involutive. By definition, a rank-$2$ distribution is involutive if and only if the Lie bracket of its generating vector fields belongs pointwise to the distribution. That is, we must check if $[X,Y] \\in \\mathcal{D}$ for all points in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\nThis is equivalent to checking if there exist smooth functions $c_{1}(x,y,z)$ and $c_{2}(x,y,z)$ such that:\n$$[X,Y] = c_{1}X + c_{2}Y$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the vector fields:\n$$-\\partial_{z} = c_{1}(\\partial_{x} + y\\,\\partial_{z}) + c_{2}(\\partial_{y})$$\n$$-\\partial_{z} = c_{1}\\partial_{x} + c_{2}\\partial_{y} + c_{1}y\\,\\partial_{z}$$\nWe can equate the components of the vector fields in the basis $\\{\\partial_{x}, \\partial_{y}, \\partial_{z}\\}$:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Coefficient of $\\partial_{x}$: $0 = c_{1}$\n    \\item Coefficient of $\\partial_{y}$: $0 = c_{2}$\n    \\item Coefficient of $\\partial_{z}$: $-1 = c_{1}y$\n\\end{enumerate}\nFrom the first equation, we find $c_{1} = 0$. Substituting this into the third equation yields $-1 = (0)y$, which simplifies to $-1 = 0$. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, there exist no such functions $c_1$ and $c_2$. The Lie bracket $[X,Y] = -\\partial_{z}$ does not lie in the plane spanned by $X$ and $Y$ at any point.\nThus, the distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ is not involutive. The indicator variable is $I=0$.\n\nFinally, we interpret this finding in the context of Frobenius' theorem. The (differentiable version of) Frobenius' theorem states that a smooth distribution is completely integrable if and only if it is involutive. \"Integrable\" means that through any point in the manifold, there exists an integral submanifold whose tangent space at every point coincides with the distribution. For our rank-$2$ distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, integrability would imply the existence of a foliation of $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ by $2$-dimensional surfaces such that at every point, the tangent plane to the surface is spanned by the vectors $X$ and $Y$.\nSince our calculation has shown that $\\mathcal{D}$ is not involutive, we conclude from Frobenius' theorem that $\\mathcal{D}$ is not integrable. It is impossible to find a family of surfaces in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ whose tangent planes are everywhere defined by $\\mathcal{D}$. The fact that $[X,Y] \\notin \\mathcal{D}$ signifies that an infinitesimal displacement along $X$ followed by one along $Y$ (and back) does not return to the original plane spanned by $\\{X, Y\\}$, but rather has a component in a new direction, in this case, the $-\\partial_{z}$ direction.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-\\partial_{z}  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2709341"}, {"introduction": "The power of the Frobenius theorem in control theory lies in its connection to reachability.
