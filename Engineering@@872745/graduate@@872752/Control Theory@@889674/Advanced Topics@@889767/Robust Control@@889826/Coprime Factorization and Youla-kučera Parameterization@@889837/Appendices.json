It is a standard exercise in algebraic control theory that connects the polynomial ring structure to the synthesis of stabilizing controllers. The logical steps are self-contained and mathematically verifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full, reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts as requested.\n\n#### Part 1: Justification of Coprimality and Existence of Bézout's Identity\n\nTwo polynomials in $\\mathbb{R}[s]$ are defined as coprime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is a non-zero constant. Since the ring of polynomials $\\mathbb{R}[s]$\nis a Euclidean domain, we can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of $m(s) = s + 1$ and $n(s) = s + 2$. The algorithm consists of sequential polynomial division.\n\nWe divide the polynomial of higher degree, $n(s)$, by the polynomial of lower degree, $m(s)$. In this case, both are of degree $1$, so the choice is arbitrary. Let's divide $n(s)$ by $m(s)$:\n$$\nn(s) = q_1(s) m(s) + r_1(s)\n$$\n$$\ns + 2 = (1)(s + 1) + 1\n$$\nThe quotient is $q_1(s) = 1$ and the remainder is $r_1(s) = 1$. Since the remainder is a non-zero constant, the algorithm terminates. The last non-zero remainder, when made monic, is the GCD. Here, the GCD is $1$.\n\nSince $\\text{gcd}(m(s), n(s)) = 1$, the polynomials $m(s)$ and $n(s)$ are coprime in $\\mathbb{R}[s]$. For a commutative ring like $\\mathbb{R}[s]$, the distinction between right and left coprimality is moot; they are simply coprime.\n\nBézout's identity for a Euclidean domain states that if $d(s) = \\text{gcd}(m(s), n(s))$, then there exist elements $x(s)$ and $y(s)$ in the domain such that $x(s)m(s) + y(s)n(s) = d(s)$. Since we have found that $\\text{gcd}(m(s), n(s)) = 1$, it follows directly from this theorem that there must exist polynomials $x(s), y(s) \\in \\mathbb{R}[s]$ satisfying the identity:\n$$\nx(s)m(s) + y(s)n(s) = 1\n$$\nThis justifies the existence of such a pair $(x(s), y(s))$.\n\n#### Part 2: Computation of the Bézout Pair $(x(s), y(s))$\n\nTo find an explicit pair $(x(s), y(s))$, we use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which involves working backward from the division step performed above.\nFrom the division equation:\n$$\n1 = (s+2) - (1)(s+1)\n$$\nWe rearrange this equation to match the form $x(s)m(s) + y(s)n(s) = 1$, which is $x(s)(s+1) + y(s)(s+2) = 1$.\n$$\n(-1)(s+1) + (1)(s+2) = 1\n$$\nBy comparing this with the required identity, we can identify the polynomials $x(s)$ and $y(s)$.\n$$\nx(s) = -1\n$$\n$$\ny(s) = 1\n$$\nThis gives the explicit polynomial pair $(x(s), y(s)) = (-1, 1)$. These are constant polynomials, which are elements of $\\mathbb{R}[s]$.\n\n#### Part 3: Interpretation in Youla-Kučera Parameterization\n\nThe Youla-Kučera parameterization provides a characterization of all controllers that stabilize a given plant. For a plant $P(s) = n(s)/m(s)$ with a polynomial coprime factorization, the set of all stabilizing controllers $C(s) = u(s)/v(s)$ can be parameterized using a stable, proper real-rational function $q(s)$.\n\nThe controller parameterization is given by:\n$$\nC(s) = \\frac{u(s)}{v(s)} = \\frac{y(s) + m(s)q(s)}{x(s) - n(s)q(s)}\n$$\nwhere $(x(s), y(s))$ is any particular solution to the Bézout identity $x(s)m(s) + y(s)n(s) = 1$.\n\nInternal stability of the closed-loop system requires that all four transfer functions from external inputs to internal signals, commonly known as the \"gang of four\" ($S$, $PS$, $CS$, and $T$), must be stable and proper. These are given by:\n$S = (1+PC)^{-1}$, $PS = P(1+PC)^{-1}$, $CS = C(1+PC)^{-1}$, $T = PC(1+PC)^{-1}$.\nWith the parameterization above, the characteristic polynomial becomes $m(s)v(s)+n(s)u(s) = m(x-nq)+n(y+mq) = mx - mnq + ny + nmq = mx+ny = 1$.\nThis simplifies the internal transfer functions to:\n-   $S(s) = m(s)v(s) = m(s)(x(s) - n(s)q(s))$\n-   $PS(s) = n(s)v(s) = n(s)(x(s) - n(s)q(s))$\n-   $CS(s) = m(s)u(s) = m(s)(y(s) + m(s)q(s))$\n-   $T(s) = n(s)u(s) = n(s)(y(s) + m(s)q(s))$\n\nThe problem asks to interpret the case where the free parameter $q(s)$ is set to $0$. This specifies the \"central\" controller, $C_0(s) = y(s)/x(s)$.\nUsing the specific pair $(x,y)=(-1,1)$ computed via the Euclidean algorithm, we have $C_0(s) = 1/(-1) = -1$.\nLet's examine the internal transfer functions for $q(s)=0$:\n-   $S(s) = m(s)x(s) = (s+1)(-1) = -s-1$\n-   $T(s) = n(s)y(s) = (s+2)(1) = s+2$\nThese functions are polynomials of degree $1$, not proper rational functions. Properness is a necessary condition for physical realizability, and BIBO stability requires that all internal transfer functions be proper. Therefore, the controller $C(s)=-1$ derived from this minimal-degree Bézout pair does not result in an internally stable system in the standard sense.\n\nHowever, the choice of the pair $(x(s),y(s))$ is not unique. The general solution to $x(s)m(s) + y(s)n(s) = 1$ is given by:\n$$\nx_k(s) = x(s) - k(s)n(s) = -1 - k(s)(s+2)\n$$\n$$\ny_k(s) = y(s) + k(s)m(s) = 1 + k(s)(s+1)\n$$\nwhere $k(s)$ is any polynomial in $\\mathbb{R}[s]$. For the central controller $C_k(s) = y_k(s)/x_k(s)$ to be a valid, proper controller, we need $\\deg(y_k) \\le \\deg(x_k)$. If we choose $k(s)=c$ to be a non-zero constant, this condition is met. Let's analyze such a controller:\n$$\nC_c(s) = \\frac{1+c(s+1)}{-1-c(s+2)} = \\frac{cs + (c+1)}{-cs - (2c+1)}\n$$\nAs established by the Youla-Kučera theory, the choice of a controller from the parameterized family guarantees the closed-loop characteristic polynomial is 1, so stability is guaranteed provided the controller itself is stable and does not introduce any unstable pole-zero cancellations with the plant. The plant $P(s)$ is stable and minimum-phase, so no unstable cancellations are possible. We must therefore ensure that the controller $C_c(s)$ is stable. The pole of $C_c(s)$ is located at the root of its denominator, $-cs - (2c+1) = 0$, which is $s = -(2c+1)/c$. For stability, this pole must be in the left-half plane, so we require $s  0$. This gives the condition $-(2c+1)/c  0$, or $(2c+1)/c > 0$. This inequality holds true for all $c > 0$ or $c  -1/2$. For any such choice of $c$, the controller $C_c(s)$ is stable and thus stabilizing. For instance, choosing $c=1/2$ gives the stable, stabilizing controller $C(s) = - \\frac{s+3}{s+4}$.\n\nThus, the existence of a polynomial Bézout identity implies the existence of a family of solutions $(x_k, y_k)$. While the minimal-degree solution may not yield a proper stabilizing controller for $q(s)=0$, other solutions within this family (obtained by choosing an appropriate $k(s)$) do. This demonstrates how the existence of a polynomial Bézout pair is fundamentally linked to the existence of a stabilizing controller that can be identified as the central choice ($q(s)=0$) in a suitably chosen parameterization.\n\nThe question asks for the computation of the explicit polynomials from first principles, which yields the minimal degree solution.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -1  1 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2697784"}, {"introduction": "For practical applications in robust control, factorizations are typically performed over the ring of stable, proper rational functions, not just polynomials.

There are no logical contradictions, missing information, or violations of fundamental principles. We may therefore proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe given plant transfer function is $P(s) = \\dfrac{s - 1}{s + 2}$. The objective is to find a normalized right coprime factorization of $P(s)$ over the ring of real-rational, proper, stable transfer functions. This factorization is denoted by the pair $(n(s), m(s))$ such that $P(s) = n(s)m(s)^{-1}$. The procedure is based on scalar spectral factorization.\n\nFirst, we must construct the function $\\Phi(s)$, defined as $\\Phi(s) \\triangleq 1 + P^{\\sim}(s) P(s)$. The para-conjugate $P^{\\sim}(s)$ is defined as $P(-s)$.\nFor the given $P(s)$, we have:\n$$\nP^{\\sim}(s) = P(-s) = \\frac{(-s) - 1}{(-s) + 2} = \\frac{-(s + 1)}{-(s - 2)} = \\frac{s + 1}{s - 2}\n$$\nNext, we compute the product $P^{\\sim}(s) P(s)$:\n$$\nP^{\\sim}(s) P(s) = \\left( \\frac{s + 1}{s - 2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{s - 1}{s + 2} \\right) = \\frac{(s + 1)(s - 1)}{(s - 2)(s + 2)} = \\frac{s^2 - 1}{s^2 - 4}\n$$\nUsing this product, we form $\\Phi(s)$:\n$$\n\\Phi(s) = 1 + P^{\\sim}(s) P(s) = 1 + \\frac{s^2 - 1}{s^2 - 4} = \\frac{(s^2 - 4) + (s^2 - 1)}{s^2 - 4} = \\frac{2s^2 - 5}{s^2 - 4}\n$$\nThe second step is to find the stable, minimum-phase spectral factor $q(s)$ that satisfies the relation $q(-s) q(s) = \\Phi(s)$. To do this, we analyze the poles and zeros of $\\Phi(s)$.\nThe zeros of $\\Phi(s)$ are the roots of the numerator $2s^2 - 5 = 0$, which are $s^2 = \\frac{5}{2}$, or $s = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}}$.\nThe poles of $\\Phi(s)$ are the roots of the denominator $s^2 - 4 = 0$, which are $s = \\pm 2$.\n\nFor $q(s)$ to be stable, its poles must be in the open left-half complex plane. From the poles of $\\Phi(s)$, we select the pole at $s = -2$.\nFor $q(s)$ to be minimum-phase, its zeros must also be in the open left-half complex plane. From the zeros of $\\Phi(s)$, we select the zero at $s = -\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}}$.\n\nWe can now construct $q(s)$ by assembling these components. Let us write $\\Phi(s)$ in factored form:\n$$\n\\Phi(s) = \\frac{2(s^2 - \\frac{5}{2})}{s^2 - 4} = \\frac{2(s - \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}})(s + \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}})}{(s - 2)(s + 2)}\n$$\nWe propose a form for $q(s) = k \\frac{s + \\sqrt{5/2}}{s + 2}$, where $k$ is a constant. Then $q(-s) = k \\frac{-s + \\sqrt{5/2}}{-s + 2} = k \\frac{s - \\sqrt{5/2}}{s - 2}$.\nThe product is:\n$$\nq(-s) q(s) = k^2 \\frac{(s - \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}})(s + \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}})}{(s - 2)(s + 2)} = k^2 \\frac{s^2 - \\frac{5}{2}}{s^2 - 4}\n$$\nComparing this with $\\Phi(s) = 2 \\frac{s^2 - \\frac{5}{2}}{s^2 - 4}$, we deduce that $k^2 = 2$. We choose the positive root, $k = \\sqrt{2}$.\nTherefore, the spectral factor $q(s)$ is:\n$$\nq(s) = \\sqrt{2} \\left( \\frac{s + \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}}}{s + 2} \\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} s + \\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}}}{s + 2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}s + \\sqrt{5}}{s + 2}\n$$\nThis function $q(s)$ is stable (pole at $s = -2$) and minimum-phase (zero at $s = -\\sqrt{5/2}$), as required.\n\nFinally, we derive the coprime factors $m(s)$ and $n(s)$ using the given definitions.\nThe factor $m(s)$ is defined as the inverse of $q(s)$:\n$$\nm(s) \\triangleq q(s)^{-1} = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}s + \\sqrt{5}}{s + 2} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{s + 2}{\\sqrt{2}s + \\sqrt{5}}\n$$\nThis function $m(s)$ is stable, with its pole at $s = -\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{2}} = -\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}}$, which is in the left-half plane. It is also proper, as the degrees of the numerator and denominator are both $1$.\n\nThe factor $n(s)$ is defined as $q(s)^{-1} P(s)$, which is equivalent to $m(s) P(s)$:\n$$\nn(s) \\triangleq m(s) P(s) = \\left( \\frac{s + 2}{\\sqrt{2}s + \\sqrt{5}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{s - 1}{s + 2} \\right)\n$$\nThe term $(s+2)$ cancels in the numerator and denominator, yielding the expression in lowest terms:\n$$\nn(s) = \\frac{s - 1}{\\sqrt{2}s + \\sqrt{5}}\n$$\nThis function $n(s)$ is also stable, having the same pole as $m(s)$ at $s = -\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}}$. It is also proper, with numerator and denominator degrees both equal to $1$.\n\nThe pair $(m(s), n(s))$ constitutes the normalized right coprime factorization. The property of coprimeness is confirmed by the existence of stable, proper functions $X(s)$ and $Y(s)$ such that $X(s)n(s) + Y(s)m(s)=1$, which is readily verifiable.

The constraints are $|T(j\\omega)| \\le b_T(\\omega)$ and $|S(j\\omega)| \\le b_S(\\omega)$, which are equivalent to:\n$$|T(j\\omega)|^2 = \\frac{k^2}{(\\omega^2+1)(\\omega^2+q_1^2)} \\le b_T^2(\\omega)$$\n$$|S(j\\omega)|^2 = \\frac{(q_1-k-\\omega^2)^2 + \\omega^2(1+q_1)^2}{(\\omega^2+1)(\\omega^2+q_1^2)} \\le b_S^2(\\omega)$$\nFor a given test case, a solution is feasible if there exists at least one pair of parameters $(k, q_1)$ with $k0, q_10$ that simultaneously satisfies these two inequalities for all specified frequencies $\\omega \\in \\Omega$.\n\nBefore proceeding to numerical search, we must analyze the fundamental constraint $S+T=1$. By the triangle inequality, $|S(j\\omega)| + |T(j\\omega)| \\ge |S(j\\omega) + T(j\\omega)| = |1| = 1$. This implies that a necessary condition for feasibility at any frequency $\\omega$ is that the bounds must permit this, i.e., $b_S(\\omega) + b_T(\\omega) \\ge 1$. Let us examine the test cases.\n\n- Case 1: All frequency points satisfy $b_S(\\omega) + b_T(\\omega) \\ge 1$. Feasibility is possible.\n  - At $\\omega=0.01: 0.05 + 0.98 = 1.03 \\ge 1$.\n  - At $\\omega=1.0: 0.60 + 0.80 = 1.40 \\ge 1$.\n  - At $\\omega=10.0: 1.00 + 0.20 = 1.20 \\ge 1$.\n\n- Case 2: At $\\omega=1.0$, the bounds are $b_S(1.0) = 0.30$ and $b_T(1.0) = 0.60$.\n  Their sum is $0.30 + 0.60 = 0.90$.\n  This violates the necessary condition, as $0.90  1$. It is mathematically impossible to find any controller, regardless of its form, that can simultaneously satisfy $|S(j1.0)| \\le 0.30$ and $|T(j1.0)| \\le 0.60$. Thus, Case 2 is provably infeasible without any search. The correct output must be False.\n\n- Case 3: All frequency points satisfy $b_S(\\omega) + b_T(\\omega) \\ge 1$. Feasibility is possible.\n  - At $\\omega=0.10: 0.35 + 0.70 = 1.05 \\ge 1$.\n  - At $\\omega=10.0: 1.00 + 0.05 = 1.05 \\ge 1$.\n\nFor Cases 1 and 3, feasibility must be determined by a numerical search. We will construct a grid of candidate $(k, q_1)$ values and test each point. A logarithmic grid is appropriate for parameters that span several orders of magnitude. We define a search grid for $k$ and $q_1$ over the range $[10^{-2}, 10^3]$ with $200$ points for each parameter. For each test case, we construct a boolean mask over this grid, initially all True. For each frequency constraint, we update the mask, setting elements to False where the constraint is violated. If any element of the final mask remains True, a feasible parameter set exists.
