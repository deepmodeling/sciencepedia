If not, identify the unstable pole.\n\nStep 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens.\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in classical control theory, dealing with transfer functions, feedback stability, sensitivity functions, and the critical concept of internal stability versus input-output stability. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to derive the required transfer functions and analyze their stability. The use of an unstable pole-zero cancellation is a standard pedagogical example to illustrate potential pitfalls in controller design. The problem is objective and uses precise, unambiguous language. It does not violate any scientific principles, is not incomplete or contradictory, and is not trivial. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the general closed-loop transfer functions for the given unity feedback configuration. The signals in the Laplace domain are the reference $r(s)$, the error $e(s)$, the control action $u(s)$, the disturbance $d(s)$, and the output $y(s)$. The relationships are:\n$e(s) = r(s) - y(s)$\n$u(s) = K(s) e(s) = K(s) (r(s) - y(s))$\n$y(s) = P(s) (u(s) + d(s))$\n\nSubstitute the expression for $u(s)$ into the equation for $y(s)$:\n$y(s) = P(s) [K(s) (r(s) - y(s)) + d(s)]$\n$y(s) = P(s) K(s) r(s) - P(s) K(s) y(s) + P(s) d(s)$\n\nCollect terms with $y(s)$ on the left-hand side:\n$y(s) + P(s) K(s) y(s) = P(s) K(s) r(s) + P(s) d(s)$\n$y(s) [1 + P(s) K(s)] = P(s) K(s) r(s) + P(s) d(s)$\n\nSolving for $y(s)$ yields the overall input-output relation:\n$$\ny(s) = \\frac{P(s) K(s)}{1 + P(s) K(s)} r(s) + \\frac{P(s)}{1 + P(s) K(s)} d(s)\n$$\n\nWe define the loop transfer function $L(s) = P(s) K(s)$, the sensitivity function $S(s) = \\frac{1}{1 + L(s)}$, and the complementary sensitivity function $T(s) = \\frac{L(s)}{1 + L(s)}$. Using these standard definitions, the expression for $y(s)$ becomes:\n$y(s) = T(s) r(s) + P(s) S(s) d(s)$\n\nFrom this, we identify the transfer function from reference $r$ to output $y$ as $G_{yr}(s) = T(s)$, and the transfer function from disturbance $d$ to output $y$ as $G_{yd}(s) = P(s)S(s)$. This completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we analyze the stability of these transfer functions using the given expressions for $P(s)$ and $K(s)$.\n$P(s) = \\frac{s+1}{(s-1)(s+2)}$\n$K(s) = \\frac{k(s-1)}{s+a}$\n\nThe loop transfer function is:\n$L(s) = P(s) K(s) = \\frac{s+1}{(s-1)(s+2)} \\cdot \\frac{k(s-1)}{s+a}$\n\nThe transfer function from $r$ to $y$ is $T(s) = \\frac{L(s)}{1+L(s)}$. To compute this, we first find $1+L(s)$:\n$1 + L(s) = 1 + \\frac{k(s+1)(s-1)}{(s-1)(s+2)(s+a)} = \\frac{(s-1)(s+2)(s+a) + k(s+1)(s-1)}{(s-1)(s+2)(s+a)}$\nWe can factor out the term $(s-1)$ from the numerator:\n$1 + L(s) = \\frac{(s-1)[(s+2)(s+a) + k(s+1)]}{(s-1)(s+2)(s+a)}$\n\nNow, we can write the expression for $T(s)$:\n$$\nT(s) = \\frac{L(s)}{1+L(s)} = \\frac{\\frac{k(s+1)(s-1)}{(s-1)(s+2)(s+a)}}{\\frac{(s-1)[(s+2)(s+a) + k(s+1)]}{(s-1)(s+2)(s+a)}} = \\frac{k(s+1)(s-1)}{(s-1)[(s+2)(s+a) + k(s+1)]}\n$$\nIn the context of deriving the transfer function, the pole at $s=1$ is cancelled by the zero at $s=1$. This yields:\n$$\nT(s) = \\frac{k(s+1)}{(s+2)(s+a) + k(s+1)} = \\frac{k(s+1)}{s^2 + (a+2)s + 2a + ks + k} = \\frac{k(s+1)}{s^2 + (a+k+2)s + (2a+k)}\n$$\nThe poles of $T(s)$ are the roots of the characteristic polynomial $s^2 + (a+k+2)s + (2a+k) = 0$. Given that $a0$ and $k0$, all coefficients of this quadratic polynomial are strictly positive. By the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion, both roots must have negative real parts, meaning they are in the open left-half complex plane. This confirms the problem's assumption that the map from $r$ to $y$ is stable.\n\nNow, we must determine the stability of the map from $d$ to $y$, which is given by $G_{yd}(s) = P(s)S(s) = \\frac{P(s)}{1+L(s)}$.\n$$\nG_{yd}(s) = \\frac{\\frac{s+1}{(s-1)(s+2)}}{\\frac{(s-1)[(s+2)(s+a) + k(s+1)]}{(s-1)(s+2)(s+a)}}\n$$\nWe simplify this expression by multiplying the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator:\n$$\nG_{yd}(s) = \\frac{s+1}{(s-1)(s+2)} \\cdot \\frac{(s-1)(s+2)(s+a)}{(s-1)[(s+2)(s+a) + k(s+1)]}\n$$\nAfter cancellation of the common factor $(s+2)$, we get:\n$$\nG_{yd}(s) = \\frac{(s+1)(s+a)}{(s-1)[(s+2)(s+a) + k(s+1)]}\n$$\nSubstituting the characteristic polynomial from the analysis of $T(s)$, we have:\n$$\nG_{yd}(s) = \\frac{(s+1)(s+a)}{(s-1)[s^2 + (a+k+2)s + (2a+k)]}\n$$\nThe poles of this transfer function are the roots of the denominator. These are $s=1$ and the roots of $s^2 + (a+k+2)s + (2a+k)=0$. As established previously, the roots of the quadratic part lie in the open left-half plane. However, the factor $(s-1)$ in the denominator introduces a pole at $s=+1$. A pole in the right-half plane signifies instability.\n\nThe unstable pole-zero cancellation at $s=1$ in the loop transfer function $L(s)$ hides the instability in the input-output map from $r$ to $y$. This phenomenon is known as a loss of internal stability. The unstable mode associated with the pole at $s=1$ is not observable from the reference input but is excitable by the disturbance $d$ at the plant input.\n\nTherefore, the closed-loop map from $d$ to $y$ is unstable. The precise location of its unstable pole is $s=1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "2744192"}, {"introduction": "Modern control design formalizes the trade-offs between performance and robustness into a powerful mathematical framework.

The exogenous input is $w=r$ and the controller measurement is $y_K=e$.\n$y_{K} = e = r - y = r - P(s)u = 1 \\cdot w - P(s)u$.\nFrom this, we identify $G_{21}(s) = 1$ and $G_{22}(s) = -P(s)$.\n\nThe performance outputs are $z = \\begin{pmatrix} z_{1} \\\\ z_{2} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n_\n$z_{1} = W_{1}(s)e = W_{1}(s)(r-y) = W_{1}(s)(w - P(s)u) = W_{1}(s)w - W_{1}(s)P(s)u$.\n_\n$z_{2} = W_{2}(s)y = W_{2}(s)P(s)u = 0 \\cdot w + W_{2}(s)P(s)u$.\n\nIn matrix form, this is:\n$$ z = \\begin{pmatrix} W_{1}(s) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} w + \\begin{pmatrix} -W_{1}(s)P(s) \\\\ W_{2}(s)P(s) \\end{pmatrix} u $$\nFrom this, we identify $G_{11}(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} W_{1}(s) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $G_{12}(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} -W_{1}(s)P(s) \\\\ W_{2}(s)P(s) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe lower LFT formula is $T_{zw}(s) = F_{l}(G,K) = G_{11} + G_{12}K(I - G_{22}K)^{-1}G_{21}$.\nSince the system is single-input single-output (SISO), $I$ is the scalar $1$.\n$$ T_{zw}(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} W_{1}(s) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} -W_{1}(s)P(s) \\\\ W_{2}(s)P(s) \\end{pmatrix} K(s) (1 - (-P(s))K(s))^{-1} \\cdot 1 $$\n$$ T_{zw}(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} W_{1}(s) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} -W_{1}(s)P(s)K(s) \\\\ W_{2}(s)P(s)K(s) \\end{pmatrix} (1 + P(s)K(s))^{-1} $$\nLet us recall the standard definitions of the sensitivity function $S(s)$ and the complementary sensitivity function $T(s)$ for a unity-feedback loop:\n$S(s) = (1 + P(s)K(s))^{-1}$.\n$T(s) = P(s)K(s)(1 + P(s)K(s))^{-1} = P(s)K(s)S(s)$.\nIt is also fundamental that $S(s) + T(s) = 1$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $T_{zw}(s)$:\nThe first component is: $W_{1}(s) - W_{1}(s)P(s)K(s)(1 + P(s)K(s))^{-1} = W_{1}(s) - W_{1}(s)T(s) = W_{1}(s)(1 - T(s)) = W_{1}(s)S(s)$.\nThe second component is: $W_{2}(s)P(s)K(s)(1 + P(s)K(s))^{-1} = W_{2}(s)T(s)$.\nSo, the closed-loop transfer matrix is:\n$$ T_{zw}(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} W_{1}(s)S(s) \\\\ W_{2}(s)T(s) \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis completes the second task.\n\nFor the third and final task, I must find the expression for the sensitivity function $S(s)$ when the controller is a static gain, $K(s) = k$.\nUsing the definition $S(s) = (1 + P(s)K(s))^{-1}$ and the given plant $P(s) = \\dfrac{s+2}{(s+1)(s+3)}$, we substitute $K(s) = k$:\n$$ S(s) = \\left( 1 + \\left(\\dfrac{s+2}{(s+1)(s+3)}\\right) k \\right)^{-1} $$\nTo simplify, find a common denominator for the expression in the parenthesis:\n$$ S(s) = \\left( \\dfrac{(s+1)(s+3) + k(s+2)}{(s+1)(s+3)} \\right)^{-1} $$\nInverting the fraction yields:\n$$ S(s) = \\dfrac{(s+1)(s+3)}{(s+1)(s+3) + k(s+2)} $$\nExpanding the polynomials in the numerator and denominator:\nNumerator: $(s+1)(s+3) = s^2 + 3s + s + 3 = s^2 + 4s + 3$.\nDenominator: $(s^2 + 4s + 3) + ks + 2k = s^2 + (4+k)s + (3+2k)$.\nTherefore, the explicit closed-form expression for the sensitivity function is:\n$$ S(s) = \\dfrac{s^2 + 4s + 3}{s^2 + (4+k)s + (3+2k)} $$\nThis is the final answer required by the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{s^2 + 4s + 3}{s^2 + (k+4)s + 2k + 3}}\n$$", "id": "2744167"}]}
