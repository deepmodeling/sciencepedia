It is a well-posed, standard exercise in the analysis of robust stability. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid, and we may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to find a perturbation $\\Delta$ with the smallest norm $\\|\\Delta\\|$ that makes the system unstable. The condition for instability is the singularity of the matrix $I - M\\Delta$, which is equivalent to $\\det(I - M\\Delta) = 0$.\n\nLet us first compute the product $M\\Delta$:\n$$\nM\\Delta = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0  m_{12} \\\\\nm_{21}  0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\delta_1  0 \\\\\n0  \\delta_2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n= \\begin{bmatrix}\n0  m_{12}\\delta_2 \\\\\nm_{21}\\delta_1  0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we form the matrix $I - M\\Delta$:\n$$\nI - M\\Delta = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1  0 \\\\\n0  1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n-\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0  m_{12}\\delta_2 \\\\\nm_{21}\\delta_1  0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1  -m_{12}\\delta_2 \\\\\n-m_{21}\\delta_1  1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe singularity condition, $\\det(I - M\\Delta) = 0$, becomes:\n$$\n(1)(1) - (-m_{12}\\delta_2)(-m_{21}\\delta_1) = 0\n$$\n$$\n1 - m_{12}m_{21}\\delta_1\\delta_2 = 0\n$$\nThis gives the fundamental constraint on any destabilizing perturbation:\n$$\n\\delta_1\\delta_2 = \\frac{1}{m_{12}m_{21}}\n$$\nWe are tasked to find the infimum of $\\|\\Delta\\| = \\max\\{|\\delta_{1}|, |\\delta_{2}|\\}$ subject to this constraint.

For each $\\omega \\in \\Omega$, call a routine that computes an upper bound $\\overline{\\mu}(\\omega)$ by solving a scaling optimization over matrices that commute with $\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}$, yielding scaling certificates $\\{D(\\omega),G(\\omega)\\}$ when real scalar blocks are present, and that minimizes a bound on $\\mu_{\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}}\\!\\left(M(j\\omega)\\right)$. In parallel, compute a lower bound $\\underline{\\mu}(\\omega)$ by searching over $\\Delta \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Delta}$ for which $I - M(j\\omega)\\Delta$ is singular or nearly singular, using structured power or gradient iterations and returning an explicit $\\Delta(\\omega)$ that achieves $\\| \\Delta(\\omega) \\|^{-1} = \\underline{\\mu}(\\omega)$. Refine $\\Omega$ adaptively near frequencies where $\\overline{\\mu}(\\omega)$ or $\\underline{\\mu}(\\omega)$ exhibits peaks until the peak value changes by less than a specified tolerance. Conclude robust stability if $\\sup_{\\omega \\in \\Omega} \\overline{\\mu}(\\omega)  1$, otherwise report the worst-case frequency $\\omega^\\star$, the scaling certificates for $\\overline{\\mu}(\\omega^\\star)$, and the destabilizing perturbation $\\Delta(\\omega^\\star)$ for $\\underline{\\mu}(\\omega^\\star)$.\n\nB. Compute the unstructured induced norm $\\|M\\|_{\\mathcal{H}_\\infty}$ and take this value as an upper bound on $\\sup_{\\omega} \\mu_{\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}}\\!\\left(M(j\\omega)\\right)$. For a lower bound, run long time-domain simulations of the closed-loop system with randomly sampled perturbations $\\Delta \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Delta}$ and record the largest gain observed; invert that gain to estimate $\\inf\\{\\|\\Delta\\|\\}$. Refinement of the frequency grid is unnecessary since the $\\mathcal{H}_\\infty$ norm already maximizes over frequency.\n\nC. Use a single, frequency-independent scaling matrix $D$ that commutes with $\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}$, found by solving a convex program that minimizes $\\|D M(s) D^{-1}\\|_{\\mathcal{H}_\\infty}$; the minimized value is the upper bound on $\\sup_{\\omega} \\mu_{\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}}\\!\\left(M(j\\omega)\\right)$. For the lower bound, assume it equals the reciprocal of the smallest singular value of $I - M(j\\omega_0)\\Delta$ at the nominal crossover frequency $\\omega_0$, without explicit search over $\\Delta$.\n\nD. Use the Nyquist plot of $\\det\\!\\left(I - M(j\\omega)\\right)$ to find the closest approach to the value $-1$; the inverse of this distance is the peak of $\\mu_{\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}}\\!\\left(M(j\\omega)\\right)$. For the lower bound, perturb each uncertain block by a small fixed percentage and check whether the closed loop becomes unstable; if so, take the inverse of that percentage as the lower bound. No scaling or certificate is needed because the Nyquist distance already characterizes the margin.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- The system is a linear time-invariant (LTI) interconnection with a complex matrix transfer function $M(s) \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n \\times n}$ in a lower Linear Fractional Transformation (LFT) configuration.\n- The structured uncertainty set is $\\boldsymbol{\\Delta} = \\operatorname{diag}\\!\\left(\\delta_1 I_{r_1}, \\ldots, \\delta_p I_{r_p}, \\Delta_1, \\ldots, \\Delta_q\\right)$, where $\\delta_k \\in \\mathbb{R}$ are repeated real scalar blocks and $\\Delta_\\ell \\in \\mathbb{C}^{m_\\ell \\times m_\\ell}$ are full complex blocks.\n- The structured singular value, $\\mu_{\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}}$, is defined at each frequency $\\omega \\in \\mathbb{R}$ as\n$$\n\\mu_{\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}}\\!\\left(M(j\\omega)\\right) \\,=\\, \\frac{1}{\\inf\\left\\{\\|\\Delta\\|: \\Delta \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Delta},\\ \\det\\!\\left(I - M(j\\omega)\\Delta\\right) = 0\\right\\}},\n$$\nwith $\\mu_{\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}}\\!\\left(M(j\\omega)\\right) = 0$ if the set of destabilizing perturbations is empty.\n- The task is to outline a correct, reproducible workflow for computing frequency-by-frequency upper and lower bounds on $\\mu_{\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}}\\!\\left(M(j\\omega)\\right)$ for a stable $M(s)$, including frequency grid design, scaling optimization for upper bounds, perturbation search for lower bounds, aggregation across frequency, and grid validation.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound and well-posed.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The definitions of the LFT framework, the structured uncertainty set $\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}$, and the structured singular value $\\mu$ are all standard and fundamental to the field of robust control theory. The premise of computing bounds using scaling matrices and perturbation search is the established state-of-the-art methodology.\n- **Well-Posed:** The question asks to identify the best description of a standard computational procedure. The problem is unambiguous and has a well-defined context.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical and precise.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be formulated by detailing the correct workflow and evaluating each provided option against this correct procedure.\n\nThe core principle for robust stability of the interconnection feedback loop described by $M(s)$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}$ is that the system is stable for all perturbations $\\Delta \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Delta}$ with $\\|\\Delta\\|  \\beta$ if and only if $\\sup_{\\omega \\in \\mathbb{R}} \\mu_{\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}}(M(j\\omega)) \\le 1/\\beta$. Therefore, robust stability for all normalized perturbations (i.e., $\\|\\Delta\\| \\le 1$) is equivalent to the condition $\\sup_{\\omega} \\mu_{\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}}(M(j\\omega))  1$.\n\nComputing $\\mu_{\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}}(M)$ exactly is an NP-hard problem. Therefore, the standard and practical workflow relies on computing tight, certified upper and lower bounds on $\\mu_{\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}}(M(j\\omega))$ at each point on a frequency grid.\n\nThe correct workflow is as follows:\n1.  **Frequency Grid Selection**: A frequency grid $\\Omega$ is established, typically with logarithmic spacing, to cover the range of interest for the system dynamics. This range must include the system's bandwidth and any resonant frequencies where $\\mu$ values are likely to peak.\n2.  **Upper Bound Computation**: For each frequency $\\omega \\in \\Omega$, an upper bound $\\overline{\\mu}(\\omega)$ is computed for $\\mu_{\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}}(M(j\\omega))$. This is based on the property that $\\mu_{\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}}(M) \\le \\inf_{D \\in \\mathcal{D}} \\bar{\\sigma}(DMD^{-1})$, where $\\bar{\\sigma}$ is the maximum singular value and $\\mathcal{D}$ is the set of invertible matrices that commute with the uncertainty structure $\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}$. For mixed real and complex uncertainties, this is extended using an additional set of scaling matrices $\\mathcal{G}$, leading to a convex optimization problem (solvable as a Linear Matrix Inequality, LMI) that yields the upper bound. The optimal scaling matrices, denoted $\\{D(\\omega), G(\\omega)\\}$, serve as certificates for the computed bound $\\overline{\\mu}(\\omega)$.\n3.  **Lower Bound Computation**: For each $\\omega \\in \\Omega$, a lower bound $\\underline{\\mu}(\\omega)$ is sought. This is a non-convex optimization problem aimed at finding a specific perturbation $\\Delta_0 \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Delta}}$ that makes $I - M(j\\omega)\\Delta_0$ singular. If such a $\\Delta_0$ is found, then by definition, $\\mu_{\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}}(M(j\\omega)) \\ge \\frac{1}{\\|\\Delta_0\\|}$. The standard algorithm for this search is the *structured power iteration*, which is a local optimization heuristic. A successful iteration yields a destabilizing perturbation $\\Delta(\\omega)$ and a corresponding lower bound $\\underline{\\mu}(\\omega) = 1/\\|\\Delta(\\omega)\\|$.\n4.  **Grid Refinement and Aggregation**: The initial grid may be too coarse to capture the true peak of the function $\\mu_{\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}}(M(j\\omega))$. The workflow must include an adaptive refinement of the grid $\\Omega$, adding frequency points in regions where the upper bound $\\overline{\\mu}(\\omega)$ shows peaks or large variations. This process is repeated until the peak value of the upper bound, $\\sup_{\\omega \\in \\Omega} \\overline{\\mu}(\\omega)$, has converged.\n5.  **Conclusion**: The final assessment is based on the peak upper bound. If $\\sup_{\\omega} \\overline{\\mu}(\\omega)  1$, robust stability is guaranteed. If $\\sup_{\\omega} \\underline{\\mu}(\\omega) \\ge 1$, robust instability is guaranteed. If the bounds bracket $1$, the result is inconclusive, but the frequency $\\omega^\\star$ corresponding to the peak, along with the certificates ($D(\\omega^\\star)$, $G(\\omega^\\star)$ and $\\Delta(\\omega^\\star)$), provide crucial information for system analysis or redesign.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Build a logarithmic frequency grid $\\Omega$ that spans the closed-loop bandwidth and extends beyond it. For each $\\omega \\in \\Omega$, call a routine that computes an upper bound $\\overline{\\mu}(\\omega)$ by solving a scaling optimization over matrices that commute with $\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}$, yielding scaling certificates $\\{D(\\omega),G(\\omega)\\}$ when real scalar blocks are present, and that minimizes a bound on $\\mu_{\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}}\\!\\left(M(j\\omega)\\right)$. In parallel, compute a lower bound $\\underline{\\mu}(\\omega)$ by searching over $\\Delta \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Delta}$ for which $I - M(j\\omega)\\Delta$ is singular or nearly singular, using structured power or gradient iterations and returning an explicit $\\Delta(\\omega)$ that achieves $\\| \\Delta(\\omega) \\|^{-1} = \\underline{\\mu}(\\omega)$. Refine $\\Omega$ adaptively near frequencies where $\\overline{\\mu}(\\omega)$ or $\\underline{\\mu}(\\omega)$ exhibits peaks until the peak value changes by less than a specified tolerance. Conclude robust stability if $\\sup_{\\omega \\in \\Omega} \\overline{\\mu}(\\omega)  1$, otherwise report the worst-case frequency $\\omega^\\star$, the scaling certificates for $\\overline{\\mu}(\\omega^\\star)$, and the destabilizing perturbation $\\Delta(\\omega^\\star)$ for $\\underline{\\mu}(\\omega^\\star)$.**\nThis option correctly describes all essential components of the modern $\\mu$-analysis workflow: initial frequency gridding, frequency-wise computation of a certified upper bound via scaling optimization, computation of a certified lower bound via a structured power iteration, adaptive grid refinement to find the peak, and correct interpretation of the final result. The mention of scaling certificates $\\{D(\\omega), G(\\omega)\\}$ and the destabilizing perturbation $\\Delta(\\omega)$ is also accurate.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Compute the unstructured induced norm $\\|M\\|_{\\mathcal{H}_\\infty}$ and take this value as an upper bound on $\\sup_{\\omega} \\mu_{\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}}\\!\\left(M(j\\omega)\\right)$. For a lower bound, run long time-domain simulations of the closed-loop system with randomly sampled perturbations $\\Delta \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Delta}$ and record the largest gain observed; invert that gain to estimate $\\inf\\{\\|\\Delta\\|\\}$. Refinement of the frequency grid is unnecessary since the $\\mathcal{H}_\\infty$ norm already maximizes over frequency.**\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. While it is true that $\\mu_{\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}}(M) \\le \\bar{\\sigma}(M)$, and therefore $\\sup_{\\omega} \\mu_{\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}}(M(j\\omega)) \\le \\|M\\|_{\\mathcal{H}_\\infty}$, this bound ignores the uncertainty structure $\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}$ and is often extremely conservative. The very purpose of $\\mu$-analysis is to obtain a less conservative, structured result. The proposed method for the lower bound is a non-systematic Monte Carlo simulation, which offers no guarantee of finding the worst-case perturbation and is not the standard procedure. The final statement about grid refinement is nonsensical in this context.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Use a single, frequency-independent scaling matrix $D$ that commutes with $\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}$, found by solving a convex program that minimizes $\\|D M(s) D^{-1}\\|_{\\mathcal{H}_\\infty}$; the minimized value is the upper bound on $\\sup_{\\omega} \\mu_{\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}}\\!\\left(M(j\\omega)\\right)$. For the lower bound, assume it equals the reciprocal of the smallest singular value of $I - M(j\\omega_0)\\Delta$ at the nominal crossover frequency $\\omega_0$, without explicit search over $\\Delta$.**\nThis option confuses $\\mu$-analysis with $\\mu$-synthesis (D-K iteration). The use of frequency-independent scalings is a technique for controller design, not for achieving the tightest possible analysis bound. For analysis, scalings must be frequency-dependent. The proposed method for the lower bound is incoherent; it refers to a perturbation $\\Delta$ but states there is no search for it, making the calculation impossible. It also illogically restricts the analysis to a single frequency $\\omega_0$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Use the Nyquist plot of $\\det\\!\\left(I - M(j\\omega)\\right)$ to find the closest approach to the value $-1$; the inverse of this distance is the peak of $\\mu_{\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}}\\!\\left(M(j\\omega)\\right)$. For the lower bound, perturb each uncertain block by a small fixed percentage and check whether the closed loop becomes unstable; if so, take the inverse of that percentage as the lower bound. No scaling or certificate is needed because the Nyquist distance already characterizes the margin.**\nThis option demonstrates a severe misunderstanding of MIMO robust stability. The stability condition is $\\det(I - M\\Delta) = 0$, which depends on the unknown perturbation $\\Delta$. The term $\\det(I - M)$ has no direct, general meaning for this stability test. The proposed use of a Nyquist plot is baseless. The lower bound method is an ad-hoc trial-and-error approach that is not guaranteed to find the smallest destabilizing perturbation. The claim that no scaling is needed is false; scaling matrices are central to computing the $\\mu$ upper bound.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2750541"}]}
