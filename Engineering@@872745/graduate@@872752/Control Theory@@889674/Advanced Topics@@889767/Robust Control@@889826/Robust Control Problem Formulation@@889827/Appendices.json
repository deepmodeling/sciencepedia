The problem states that the controller $K(s)$ is stabilizing, which implies that the closed-loop system is internally stable. Therefore, all poles of $S(s)$ lie strictly in the left-half-plane (LHP), and $S(s)$ is analytic throughout the RHP.\n2.  **Zeros of $S(s)$**: The zeros of $S(s)$ are the poles of $1+L(s)$, which are the poles of $L(s)$. The poles of $L(s)=P(s)K(s)$ are the combined poles of the plant $P(s)$ and the controller $K(s)$. For internal stability, the controller cannot cancel any RHP poles of the plant. We assume the proper controller $K(s)$ is stable, as is standard practice for stabilizing an unstable plant. Thus, the RHP poles of $L(s)$ are identical to the RHP poles of $P(s)$. The problem states that $P(s)$ has exactly one RHP pole at $s=+a$, with $a0$. Consequently, $S(s)$ has exactly one RHP zero at $s=a$.\n\nSince $S(s)$ is analytic in the RHP and has a known RHP zero, we can use the Poisson-Jensen formula. This formula relates the value of an analytic function inside a domain to its boundary values and its interior zeros.

We evaluate the formula at a point on the positive real axis, $s_0=x_0$ (so $y_0=0$), where $x_0a$.\nThe formula simplifies to:\n$$ \\ln|S(x_0)| = \\ln\\left|\\frac{x_0-a}{x_0+a}\\right| + \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\ln|S(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)| \\frac{x_0}{x_0^2+\\omega^2} \\mathrm{d}\\omega $$\nSince $S(s)$ is the transfer function of a system with real coefficients, $|S(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)|$ is an even function of $\\omega$. The integral term can be written as:\n$$ \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\ln|S(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)| \\frac{x_0}{x_0^2+\\omega^2} \\mathrm{d}\\omega $$\nOur goal is to isolate the integral $I(a)=\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\ln|S(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)| \\mathrm{d}\\omega$. We can achieve this by multiplying the entire equation by $x_0$ and taking the limit as $x_0 \\to \\infty$.\n$$ \\lim_{x_0 \\to \\infty} x_0 \\ln|S(x_0)| = \\lim_{x_0 \\to \\infty} x_0 \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_0-a}{x_0+a}\\right) + \\lim_{x_0 \\to \\infty} \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\ln|S(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)| \\frac{x_0^2}{x_0^2+\\omega^2} \\mathrm{d}\\omega $$\nLet's evaluate each limit:\n\n-   **Left-hand side**: It is a standard assumption in this derivation that the loop transfer function $L(s)$ has a relative degree of at least 2, which implies $\\lim_{s \\to \\infty} sL(s) = 0$. Since $S(s) \\approx 1-L(s)$ for large $s$, we have $\\ln|S(s)| \\approx - \\text{Re}(L(s))$, and thus $\\lim_{s \\to \\infty} s\\ln|S(s)| = 0$. So, the left-hand side is zero.\n\n-   **First term on RHS**: We use the Taylor expansion for the logarithm, $\\ln(1+u) \\approx u$ for small $u$.\n$$ \\lim_{x_0 \\to \\infty} x_0 \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-a/x_0}{1+a/x_0}\\right) = \\lim_{x_0 \\to \\infty} x_0 \\left[ \\ln(1-a/x_0) - \\ln(1+a/x_0) \\right] $$\n$$ = \\lim_{x_0 \\to \\infty} x_0 \\left[ (-a/x_0) - (a/x_0) + O(1/x_0^2) \\right] = \\lim_{x_0 \\to \\infty} x_0 \\left[ -2a/x_0 \\right] = -2a $$\n\n-   **Second term on RHS**: We analyze the limit of the integral. The kernel $\\frac{x_0^2}{x_0^2+\\omega^2} = \\frac{1}{1+(\\omega/x_0)^2}$ approaches $1$ as $x_0 \\to \\infty$ for any fixed $\\omega$. By applying a suitable convergence theorem (e.g., Dominated Convergence Theorem, assuming the integral of the unweighted log-sensitivity is finite), we can swap the limit and the integral:\n$$ \\lim_{x_0 \\to \\infty} \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\ln|S(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)| \\frac{x_0^2}{x_0^2+\\omega^2} \\mathrm{d}\\omega = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\ln|S(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)| \\cdot (1) \\mathrm{d}\\omega = \\frac{2}{\\pi}I(a) $$\n\nCombining the results of the limits, we have the equation:\n$$ 0 = -2a + \\frac{2}{\\pi}I(a) $$\nSolving for $I(a)$ yields the final expression:\n$$ I(a) = \\pi a $$\nThe structural property of the plant enforcing this nonzero \"waterbed area\" is the presence of the RHP pole at $s=+a$. As shown in the derivation, this pole becomes a RHP zero of $S(s)$, which introduces the term $\\ln\\left|\\frac{x_0-a}{x_0+a}\\right|$ in the Poisson-Jensen formula. The non-zero limit of this term's contribution ($x_0$ times it) leads to the non-zero value of the integral. For a stable plant ($a$ would not exist), this term is absent, and the integral evaluates to zero (assuming rel. deg. $\\ge 2$).\n\nb) Explanation of design tradeoffs\n\nThe result from part (a), $\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\ln|S(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)|\\,\\mathrm{d}\\omega = \\pi a$, is a fundamental constraint on the sensitivity function, known as Bode's sensitivity integral. Since $a0$, the integral is strictly positive. This is the mathematical formulation of the \"waterbed effect\": any attempt to reduce sensitivity in one frequency range (i.e., making $|S(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)|  1$, so $\\ln|S(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)|  0$) must be compensated by an increase in sensitivity in another frequency range (making $|S(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)|  1$, so $\\ln|S(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)|  0$), such that the total area under the curve of $\\ln|S(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)|$ remains equal to the positive constant $\\pi a$.\n\nGood performance, such as tracking and disturbance rejection, requires $|S(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)|$ to be small over a certain bandwidth. The performance weight $W_s(s)$ formalizes this; the condition $|W_{s}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)S(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)|  1$ implies $|S(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)|  |W_s(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)|^{-1}$. The given $W_s(s)$ has a low-frequency gain of $A1$, so we require $|S(0)|  1/A$. This requires creating a significant \"negative area\" in the integral of $\\ln|S(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)|$ at low frequencies, up to the performance bandwidth $\\omega_B$.\n\nTo satisfy the integral constraint, this negative area must be balanced by a positive area where $|S(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)|  1$. This typically manifests as a peak in the sensitivity function, $M_S = \\max_{\\omega}|S(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)|  1$, at frequencies around and above $\\omega_B$. The larger the unstable pole $a$, and the more aggressive the performance specification (i.e., larger desired bandwidth $\\omega_B$ and/or larger attenuation factor $A$), the larger the required negative area, and consequently, the larger the unavoidable sensitivity peak $M_S$.\n\nThis peak in sensitivity has a direct consequence for robust stability. The robust stability condition for multiplicative output uncertainty is $|W_{\\Delta}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)T(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)|  1$, where $T(s)=1-S(s)$ is the complementary sensitivity function. A large peak $M_S$ in $|S(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)|$ implies a correspondingly large peak in $|T(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)|$ because $|T| = |1-S|$ is related by $|S|-1 \\le |T| \\le |S|+1$. Around the peak frequency, $|T|$ is often on the order of $M_S$. Let this peak be $M_T = \\max_\\omega |T(j\\omega)|$.\n\nThe tradeoff becomes critical because the uncertainty weight $W_\\Delta(s)$ typically models unmodeled dynamics at high frequencies, meaning $|W_\\Delta(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)|$ is small at low frequencies but increases with $\\omega$. The robust stability condition $|T(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)|  1/|W_\\Delta(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)|$ thus imposes a stringent upper limit on the magnitude of $T(s)$ precisely in the high-frequency region where the sensitivity peak $M_S$ (and hence a peak $M_T$) is forced to occur.\n\nIn summary, the RHP pole at $s=+a$ enforces the constraint $I(a)=\\pi a  0$. Achieving high performance (large $A$, large $\\omega_B$) necessitates a large sensitivity peak $M_S$. This large $M_S$ creates a large peak $M_T$ in the complementary sensitivity function at frequencies where the uncertainty magnitude $|W_\\Delta|$ is typically large. This may cause the product $|W_\\Delta T|$ to exceed $1$, violating robust stability. Therefore, the presence of the unstable pole at $s=+a$ establishes a fundamental conflict between nominal performance and robust stability, thereby constraining the simultaneous choice of the performance parameters $(A, M, \\omega_B)$. A more unstable plant (larger $a$) exacerbates this tradeoff, severely limiting achievable performance bandwidth and disturbance rejection.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\pi a}$$", "id": "2740504"}]}
