The system describes a linear saddle point, which is a textbook example of an unstable equilibrium. The problem is well-posed, asking for a constructive proof of this instability. The language is objective and mathematically precise. The setup is complete and free of contradictions. The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\nLet the state vector be $x = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The dynamics are governed by the linear system $\\dot{x} = Ax$, where $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 3  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The equilibrium point at the origin $x=0$ has one unstable eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 3$ and one stable eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = -1$. We will prove instability using Chetaev's theorem.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the time derivative of the Chetaev function candidate, $V(x) = x^{\\top} P x$, where $P$ is a constant symmetric matrix. Applying the chain rule, the derivative of $V(x)$ along the system trajectories is:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x) = \\frac{d}{dt}(x^{\\top} P x) = \\dot{x}^{\\top} P x + x^{\\top} P \\dot{x}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\dot{x} = Ax$:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x) = (Ax)^{\\top} P x + x^{\\top} P (Ax) = x^{\\top} A^{\\top} P x + x^{\\top} P A x\n$$\nSince this is a scalar quantity, we can express it as a single quadratic form:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x) = x^{\\top} (A^{\\top} P + PA) x\n$$\nThis is the general expression for $\\dot{V}(x)$. Let the symmetric matrix $P$ be $P = \\begin{pmatrix} p_{11}  p_{12} \\\\ p_{12}  p_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$. The matrix $A$ is given as $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 3  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}$, which is symmetric, so $A^{\\top} = A$. We compute the matrix $Q = AP + PA$:\n$$\nAP = \\begin{pmatrix} 3  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} p_{11}  p_{12} \\\\ p_{12}  p_{22} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3p_{11}  3p_{12} \\\\ -p_{12}  -p_{22} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nPA = \\begin{pmatrix} p_{11}  p_{12} \\\\ p_{12}  p_{22} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3p_{11}  -p_{12} \\\\ 3p_{12}  -p_{22} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nQ = AP + PA = \\begin{pmatrix} 6p_{11}  2p_{12} \\\\ 2p_{12}  -2p_{22} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThus, $\\dot{V}(x) = x^{\\top}Qx = 6p_{11}x_1^2 + 4p_{12}x_1x_2 - 2p_{22}x_2^2$.\n\nNext, we select a simple symmetric matrix $P$ with integer entries. The instability is driven by the $x_1$ component, associated with the positive eigenvalue. A logical choice for $V(x)$ is a function that isolates this behavior. We choose:\n$$\nP = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis gives $p_{11} = 1$, $p_{12} = 0$, and $p_{22} = -1$. With this choice, the function $V(x)$ is:\n$$\nV(x) = x^{\\top} P x = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1  x_2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix} = x_1^2 - x_2^2\n$$\nThe domain $D$ is defined by the condition $V(x) > 0$. Analytically, this is the set:\n$$\nD = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x_1^2 - x_2^2 > 0 \\}\n$$\nThis inequality is equivalent to $x_1^2 > x_2^2$, or $|x_1| > |x_2|$. This describes an open, conic region in the plane that contains the $x_1$-axis and points arbitrarily close to the origin. The boundary of $D$ is defined by $V(x) = 0$, which gives $x_1^2 - x_2^2 = 0$. The equations for the boundary rays are therefore $x_2 = x_1$ and $x_2 = -x_1$. This corresponds to the form $x_2 = \\pm k x_1$ with the positive slope parameter $k=1$.\n\nFinally, we must verify that $\\dot{V}(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in D \\setminus \\{0\\}$. We substitute the chosen values of $p_{11}$, $p_{12}$, and $p_{22}$ into our expression for $\\dot{V}(x)$:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x) = 6(1)x_1^2 + 4(0)x_1x_2 - 2(-1)x_2^2 = 6x_1^2 + 2x_2^2\n$$\nThis quadratic form is a sum of squares with positive coefficients. It is positive definite, meaning $\\dot{V}(x) > 0$ for any non-zero vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. Consequently, this condition holds for all $x \\in D \\setminus \\{0\\}$, as required by Chetaev's theorem.\n\nThe construction is complete.

The parameterization $\\bigl(x,\\,x^{2}\\bigr)$ provides a clear and direct hint for the construction of the Chetaev function $V$, suggesting the boundary of the domain $D$ is the parabola $y = x^{2}$ near the origin. The tasks are formal and verifiable through mathematical derivation.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Construction**\n\nThe problem statement requires the construction of a Chetaev function $V$ and a domain $D$. The parameterization of the boundary $\\partial D$ near the origin is given as $\\bigl(x, x^{2}\\bigr)$, which corresponds to the curve $y = x^{2}$. We are also told that the zero level set of $V$ must locally coincide with this boundary. This strongly suggests choosing a function related to the expression $y - x^{2}$.\n\nLet us define the function $V(x,y)$ as:\n$$\nV(x,y) = y - x^{2}\n$$\nThis function is continuously differentiable on all of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ (it is a polynomial, so it is $C^{\\infty}$).\n\nNext, we define the open set $D$ as the region where $V(x,y)$ is positive:\n$$\nD = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid y  x^{2}\\}\n$$\nLet's verify the given conditions:\n1. The boundary of $D$ is $\\partial D = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid y = x^{2}\\}$. The origin $(0,0)$ satisfies $0 = 0^{2}$, so the point $(0,0)$ is on $\\partial D$. Thus, $0 \\in \\partial D$.\n2. The zero level set of $V$ is $\\{(x,y) \\mid V(x,y) = y - x^{2} = 0\\}$, which is exactly the set $\\partial D$. The local coincidence is, in this case, global.\n3. By definition, for any point $(x,y) \\in D$, we have $y  x^{2}$, which implies $V(x,y) = y - x^{2}  0$.\n\nNow, we must analyze the time derivative of $V$ along the trajectories of the system, $\\dot{V}$. The system is given by the vector field $f(x,y) = (\\dot{x}, \\dot{y}) = (x, y + 3x^{2})$. The gradient of $V$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla V(x,y) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y}\\right) = (-2x, 1)\n$$\nThe time derivative $\\dot{V}$ is the dot product of the gradient of $V$ and the vector field $f$:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x,y) = \\nabla V(x,y) \\cdot f(x,y) = (-2x)(x) + (1)(y + 3x^{2}) = -2x^{2} + y + 3x^{2} = y + x^{2}\n$$\nThe final condition to check is that $\\dot{V}(x,y)  0$ on $\\partial D \\setminus \\{0\\}$ in a small neighborhood of the origin. The boundary $\\partial D$ is the set of points where $y = x^{2}$. Let's evaluate $\\dot{V}$ on this boundary:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x,y)|_{y=x^{2}} = (x^{2}) + x^{2} = 2x^{2}\n$$\nFor any point $(x,y) \\in \\partial D \\setminus \\{0\\}$, we have $x \\neq 0$. Therefore, $\\dot{V}(x,y) = 2x^{2}  0$ for all $(x,y) \\in \\partial D \\setminus \\{0\\}$. This condition is satisfied everywhere on the boundary except at the origin. All required properties for our choice of $V$ and $D$ are fulfilled.\n\n**Calculation of the Boundary Growth Coefficient**\n\nWe are asked to compute the coefficient $k$:\n$$\nk := \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{\\dot{V}\\bigl(x,\\,x^{2}\\bigr)}{x^{2}}\n$$\nThe notation $\\dot{V}(x, x^{2})$ means we evaluate $\\dot{V}(x,y) = y + x^{2}$ at points on the parameterized boundary, i.e., we substitute $y = x^{2}$:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x, x^{2}) = (x^{2}) + x^{2} = 2x^{2}\n$$\nNow, we compute the limit:\n$$\nk = \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{2x^{2}}{x^{2}}\n$$\nFor $x \\neq 0$, the expression simplifies to $2$. The limit is therefore:\n$$\nk = 2\n$$\n\n**Explanation of the Chetaev Proof Strategy**\n\nChetaev's theorem provides a criterion for the instability of an equilibrium point, here assumed to be at the origin $0$. The construction of the function $V$ and the domain $D$ are central to its proof.\nThe key insight is to find a region $D$ in any arbitrarily small neighborhood of the origin, such that any trajectory starting in this region is forced to move away from the origin.\n\nThe local coincidence of the zero level set, $V(x,y) = 0$, with the boundary of the domain, $\\partial D$, is crucial for defining this region of instability. It partitions the space near the origin into three sets: the instability region $D$ where $V  0$, its boundary where $V = 0$, and the rest of the neighborhood where $V  0$. Since the origin lies on this boundary ($V(0) = 0$), we can find points in $D$ arbitrarily close to the origin to serve as initial conditions.\n\nFor any trajectory $z(t) = (x(t), y(t))$ that starts at a point $z_0$ in $D$ (meaning $V(z_0)0$), the condition $\\dot{V}  0$ dictates that the value of $V(z(t))$ must strictly increase with time.\nSince $V(z(t))$ is increasing and starts from a positive value, it can never reach $V=0$. Consequently, the trajectory can never reach the origin, where $V(0)=0$.\n\nFurthermore, the boundary $V=0$ acts as a one-way barrier. A trajectory inside $D$ cannot cross this boundary into the region where $V0$, as this would require $V$ to decrease, which contradicts $\\dot{V}0$. The condition that $\\dot{V}0$ on the boundary itself (away from the origin) signifies that the vector field is pointing away from the boundary and into the interior of $D$. This effectively \"seals\" the region $D$ from leaking trajectories into the $V0$ zone.\n\nIn summary, a trajectory starting in $D$ (arbitrarily close to the origin) is trapped in the sense that its $V$ value must always increase. It cannot approach the origin (where $V=0$), nor can it cross the boundary $\\partial D$ (also where $V=0$). The only possibility is for the trajectory to move to points with even higher values of $V$, which ultimately forces it to leave any prescribed small neighborhood of the origin. This behavior, demonstrated for initial points arbitrarily close to the origin, is the definition of instability.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "2692637"}]}
