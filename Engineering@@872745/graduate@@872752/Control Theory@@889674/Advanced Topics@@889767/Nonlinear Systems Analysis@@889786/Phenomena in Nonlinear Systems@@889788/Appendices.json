It describes a canonical example of a limit cycle in a nonlinear feedback system, a fundamental topic in control theory. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided, and they are consistent.

The problem is a standard exercise in solving first-order linear ordinary differential equations piecewise, and it contains no ambiguities, contradictions, or factual inaccuracies.\n\n**Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. The solution proceeds.\n\nThe analysis of the symmetric limit cycle is partitioned into two halves. By symmetry, the duration of each half-period is identical, equal to $\\frac{T}{2}$, where $T$ is the total period of oscillation.\n\nLet us analyze the first half-period, where the output $y(t)$ evolves from $y = -h$ to $y = h$. According to the relay rule, for the output to increase from a value below $-h$, the input must have been switched to $u(t) = +M$. This input value is maintained until $y(t)$ reaches the upper threshold $h$.\n\nLet us define $t=0$ as the instant when $y(t)$ switches from decreasing to increasing, so that $y(0) = -h$. The governing differential equation during the interval $t \\in [0, \\frac{T}{2}]$ is:\n$$ \\tau \\frac{dy}{dt} + y(t) = kM $$\nThis is a first-order linear non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation. The general solution $y(t)$ is the sum of the homogeneous solution $y_h(t)$ and a particular solution $y_p(t)$.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is $\\tau \\dot{y}_h + y_h = 0$, which has the solution:\n$$ y_h(t) = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) $$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the right-hand side is a constant $kM$, we assume a constant particular solution $y_p(t) = A_{p}$. Substituting this into the differential equation gives:\n$$ \\tau \\frac{d}{dt}(A_{p}) + A_{p} = kM \\implies 0 + A_{p} = kM \\implies A_{p} = kM $$\nThe steady-state value towards which the system evolves is $kM$.\n\nThe general solution for this interval is therefore:\n$$ y(t) = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) + kM $$\nTo determine the constant $C$, we apply the initial condition for this half-period, which is $y(0) = -h$.\n$$ y(0) = C \\exp(0) + kM = C + kM = -h $$\nSolving for $C$ yields:\n$$ C = -h - kM = -(kM + h) $$\nThus, the specific trajectory of the output during this first half-period is:\n$$ y(t) = kM - (kM + h) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) $$\nThis first half-period concludes when the output reaches the upper switching threshold, $y(t) = h$. Let this occur at time $t = \\frac{T}{2}$.\n$$ y\\left(\\frac{T}{2}\\right) = h = kM - (kM + h) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{2\\tau}\\right) $$\nWe now solve this equation for the period $T$.\n$$ (kM + h) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{2\\tau}\\right) = kM - h $$\n$$ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{2\\tau}\\right) = \\frac{kM - h}{kM + h} $$\nTo isolate $T$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -\\frac{T}{2\\tau} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{kM - h}{kM + h}\\right) $$\nUsing the property $\\ln(\\frac{a}{b}) = -\\ln(\\frac{b}{a})$, we can write:\n$$ \\frac{T}{2\\tau} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{kM + h}{kM - h}\\right) $$\nFinally, solving for the period $T$ gives the explicit expression:\n$$ T = 2\\tau \\ln\\left(\\frac{kM + h}{kM - h}\\right) $$\nThe second half of the cycle, where $y(t)$ goes from $h$ to $-h$ under input $u(t)=-M$, will have an identical duration due to the symmetry of the system.

Due to symmetry, we can integrate over one quadrant and multiply by four:\n$$\nN(A) = \\frac{4}{\\pi A} \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\varphi(A\\sin\\theta)\\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta\n$$\nThe integral is split at $\\theta=\\alpha$:\n- For $0 \\le \\theta  \\alpha$, $A\\sin\\theta  M$, so $\\varphi(A\\sin\\theta) = A\\sin\\theta$.\n- For $\\alpha \\le \\theta \\le \\pi/2$, $A\\sin\\theta \\ge M$, so $\\varphi(A\\sin\\theta) = M$.\n$$\nN(A) = \\frac{4}{\\pi A} \\left[ \\int_0^\\alpha (A\\sin^2\\theta) \\, d\\theta + \\int_\\alpha^{\\pi/2} M\\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\right]\n$$\nWe evaluate the integrals:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\alpha A\\sin^2\\theta \\, d\\theta = A\\left[ \\frac{\\theta}{2} - \\frac{\\sin(2\\theta)}{4} \\right]_0^\\alpha = \\frac{A}{2}(\\alpha - \\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha)\n$$\n$$\n\\int_\\alpha^{\\pi/2} M\\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta = M[-\\cos\\theta]_\\alpha^{\\pi/2} = M\\cos\\alpha\n$$\nSubstituting these back:\n$$\nN(A) = \\frac{4}{\\pi A} \\left[ \\frac{A}{2}(\\alpha - \\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha) + M\\cos\\alpha \\right] = \\frac{2}{\\pi}(\\alpha - \\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha) + \\frac{4M}{\\pi A}\\cos\\alpha\n$$\nUsing $\\sin\\alpha = M/A$ and $\\cos\\alpha = \\sqrt{1-(M/A)^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{A^2-M^2}}{A}$:\n$$\nN(A) = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\left(\\alpha - \\frac{M}{A}\\frac{\\sqrt{A^2-M^2}}{A}\\right) + \\frac{4M}{\\pi A}\\frac{\\sqrt{A^2-M^2}}{A} = \\frac{2\\alpha}{\\pi} + \\frac{2M\\sqrt{A^2-M^2}}{\\pi A^2}\n$$\nSo, the full describing function is:\n$$\nN(A) = \\begin{cases} 1,  A \\le M \\\\ \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\left( \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{M}{A}\\right) + \\frac{M\\sqrt{A^2-M^2}}{A^2} \\right),  A  M \\end{cases}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Harmonic Balance Analysis**\n\nThe describing function method predicts self-excited oscillations (limit cycles) at an amplitude $A^\\star$ and frequency $\\omega^\\star$ that satisfy the harmonic balance equation:\n$$\n1 + G(j\\omega^\\star) N(A^\\star) = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad G(j\\omega^\\star) = -\\frac{1}{N(A^\\star)}\n$$\nSince the describing function $N(A)$ for saturation is purely real and positive, the right side of the equation, $-1/N(A^\\star)$, is a negative real number. This imposes two conditions:\n1. Phase condition: $\\angle G(j\\omega^\\star) = -\\pi$.\n2. Magnitude condition: $|G(j\\omega^\\star)| = 1/N(A^\\star)$.\n\nFrom Part 1, we know that for the case $K=2\\omega_p$, the phase condition is met at a unique frequency $\\omega^\\star = \\omega_p$.\nAt this frequency, we also found that $|G(j\\omega_p)|=|-1|=1$.\n\nSubstituting these into the magnitude condition:\n$$\n1 = \\frac{1}{N(A^\\star)} \\implies N(A^\\star) = 1\n$$\nWe now consult the expression for $N(A)$ from Part 2 to find the amplitude $A^\\star$ for which $N(A^\\star)=1$.\nFrom the derivation, we found that $N(A)=1$ for all amplitudes $A \\le M$. For $AM$, the function $N(A)$ is strictly decreasing from $1$ towards $0$.\nTherefore, the condition $N(A^\\star)=1$ is satisfied for any amplitude $A^\\star$ in the interval $(0, M]$.\n\nThis result indicates a neutrally stable family of oscillations. The linear system with gain $K=2\\omega_p$ is marginally stable with poles at $\\pm j\\omega_p$. Any oscillation with amplitude up to $M$ behaves as a purely linear phenomenon. A limit cycle, in the context of nonlinear dynamics, is typically understood as an oscillation whose amplitude is determined and stabilized by the nonlinearity. The smallest amplitude at which the nonlinearity is engaged is $A=M$. For any amplitude greater than this, the effective gain $N(A)$ would drop below $1$, damping the oscillation. Therefore, the sustained oscillation is predicted at the boundary of the linear region. We select the maximal amplitude from the valid range.\n\nThus, the predicted amplitude is $A^\\star = M$.\nThe predicted oscillation frequency is $\\omega^\\star = \\omega_p$.\nThe result is the pair $(A^\\star, \\omega^\\star)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} M  \\omega_{p} \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2731651"}]}
