This first exercise guides you through a fundamental derivation of the stability conditions for a second-order discrete-time system [@problem_id:2747062]. By using the bilinear transformation to map the unit disk of the $z$-plane to the left half-plane of the $w$-plane, you will see how the discrete-time Schur stability problem is converted into a continuous-time Hurwitz stability problem, providing a solid theoretical foundation for the well-known Jury conditions.", "problem": "Consider the monic quadratic polynomial in the complex variable $z$ defined by $p(z)=z^{2}+a_{1}z+a_{2}$ with real parameters $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$. In discrete-time (DT) stability analysis, a polynomial is called Schur stable if and only if all its roots lie strictly inside the open unit disk $\\{z\\in\\mathbb{C}:|z|1\\}$. Starting from this definition and any rigorously justified transformation between the unit disk and the open left half-plane, together with a continuous-time stability test for quadratics that is necessary and sufficient, derive the complete set of linear inequality constraints on the coefficients $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ that characterize Schur stability for $p(z)$.

It is a standard exercise in the stability analysis of discrete-time linear systems. We proceed with the derivation as requested.\n\nThe polynomial under consideration is $p(z) = z^{2} + a_{1}z + a_{2}$, where $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ are real parameters. A polynomial is Schur stable if all its roots lie strictly inside the open unit disk, defined by $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z|  1\\}$.\n\nWe will employ the bilinear transformation, which maps the open left half-plane of the $w$-plane to the open unit disk of the $z$-plane. The transformation is given by:\n$$ z = \\frac{1+w}{1-w} $$\nA polynomial $p(z)$ is Schur stable if and only if the transformed polynomial in $w$, let us call it $q(w)$, has all its roots in the open left half-plane (i.e., is Hurwitz stable). Substituting the transformation into the polynomial equation $p(z)=0$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{1+w}{1-w}\\right)^{2} + a_{1}\\left(\\frac{1+w}{1-w}\\right) + a_{2} = 0 $$\nTo eliminate the denominator, we multiply the entire equation by $(1-w)^{2}$, assuming $w \\neq 1$ (which corresponds to $z \\to \\infty$, not a root of a monic polynomial).\n$$ (1+w)^{2} + a_{1}(1+w)(1-w) + a_{2}(1-w)^{2} = 0 $$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$ (1 + 2w + w^{2}) + a_{1}(1 - w^{2}) + a_{2}(1 - 2w + w^{2}) = 0 $$\nCollecting coefficients of the powers of $w$:\n$$ w^{2}(1 - a_{1} + a_{2}) + w(2 - 2a_{2}) + (1 + a_{1} + a_{2}) = 0 $$\nLet this transformed polynomial be $q(w) = A w^{2} + B w + C$, where the coefficients are:\n$$ A = 1 - a_{1} + a_{2} $$\n$$ B = 2(1 - a_{2}) $$\n$$ C = 1 + a_{1} + a_{2} $$\nFor a second-degree polynomial with real coefficients to be Hurwitz stable, it is necessary and sufficient that all of its coefficients have the same sign. Since an algebraic equation can be multiplied by $-1$ without changing its roots, we can assume without loss of generality that the coefficients are all positive.\nThe case where all coefficients are negative ($A0$, $B0$, $C0$) requires $B = 2(1-a_2)  0$, which implies $a_2  1$. If $z_1, z_2$ are the roots of $p(z)$, then by Vieta's formulas, their product is $z_1 z_2 = a_2$. If $a_2  1$, then $|z_1 z_2| = |a_2| = a_2  1$. This implies that at least one root must have a magnitude greater than $1$, violating the condition for Schur stability. Therefore, the case of all-negative coefficients is impossible for a stable system.\nThus, we must have $A0$, $B0$, and $C0$. These strict inequalities are required because if any coefficient is zero, the order of the polynomial is reduced, corresponding to a root of $p(z)$ on the boundary of the unit circle (specifically, $A=0 \\implies p(-1)=0$ and $C=0 \\implies p(1)=0$), which is not strictly stable.\n\nThe set of linear inequality constraints on $a_1$ and $a_2$ is:\n1. $ A = 1 - a_{1} + a_{2}  0 $\n2. $ B = 2(1 - a_{2})  0 \\implies 1 - a_{2}  0 \\implies a_{2}  1 $\n3. $ C = 1 + a_{1} + a_{2}  0 $\n\nThese three inequalities define the region of Schur stability for the given quadratic polynomial.\n\nNext, we interpret these constraints.\nThe coefficients of the transformed polynomial $A$ and $C$ are simply the original polynomial evaluated at $z=-1$ and $z=1$ respectively:\n$A = p(-1) = (-1)^{2} + a_{1}(-1) + a_{2} = 1 - a_{1} + a_{2}$.\n$C = p(1) = 1^{2} + a_{1}(1) + a_{2} = 1 + a_{1} + a_{2}$.\n\n1.  The constraint $1 + a_{1} + a_{2}  0$ is equivalent to $p(1)  0$. The point $z=1$ is on the boundary of the unit circle. If there were a real root $z_r \\ge 1$, then since the other root $z'$ must satisfy $z_r z' = a_2$ and $z_r+z'=-a_1$, and the parabola $p(x)$ for real $x$ opens upwards, $p(1)$ would be non-positive. Thus, $p(1)  0$ prevents any real root from being located at or beyond $z=1$.\n\n2.  The constraint $1 - a_{1} + a_{2}  0$ is equivalent to $p(-1)  0$. The point $z=-1$ is also on the boundary of the unit circle. By similar reasoning, if there were a real root $z_r \\le -1$, then $p(-1)$ would be non-positive. Thus, $p(-1)  0$ prevents any real root from being located at or beyond $z=-1$.\n\n3.  The constraint $a_{2}  1$. From Vieta's formulas, $a_2$ is the product of the roots, $a_{2} = z_{1}z_{2}$. The condition for Schur stability is $|z_1|1$ and $|z_2|1$, which implies $|z_1 z_2|  1$, or $|a_2|  1$. This is equivalent to $-1  a_2  1$. The constraint we derived is $a_2  1$. The other half, $a_2  -1$, is a consequence of the first two constraints: summing $1 + a_{1} + a_{2}  0$ and $1 - a_{1} + a_{2}  0$ yields $2 + 2a_{2}  0$, or $a_{2}  -1$. If the roots are complex conjugates, $z_{1,2} = r \\exp(\\pm i\\theta)$, their product is $a_2 = z_1 z_2 = r^2$. The condition $a_2  1$ directly translates to $r^2  1$, which means the magnitude of the roots $r$ is less than $1$. Therefore, this constraint directly enforces stability for complex roots and is consistent with stability for real roots.\n\nFinally, we compute the probability. The region of Schur stability in the $(a_{1}, a_{2})$-plane is a triangle defined by the inequalities:\n- $a_{2}  1$\n- $a_{2}  a_{1} - 1$\n- $a_{2}  -a_{1} - 1$\n\nThe vertices of this triangle are found by solving the equalities:\n- $a_2=1$ and $a_2=a_1-1 \\implies 1=a_1-1 \\implies a_1=2$. Vertex: $(2, 1)$.\n- $a_2=1$ and $a_2=-a_1-1 \\implies 1=-a_1-1 \\implies a_1=-2$. Vertex: $(-2, 1)$.\n- $a_2=a_1-1$ and $a_2=-a_1-1 \\implies a_1-1 = -a_1-1 \\implies 2a_1=0 \\implies a_1=0$, which gives $a_2=-1$. Vertex: $(0, -1)$.\nThe stability region is a triangle with vertices at $(-2, 1)$, $(2, 1)$, and $(0, -1)$.\nThe area of this triangle, denoted $\\mathcal{A}_{\\text{stable}}$, is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. The base is the segment from $(-2, 1)$ to $(2, 1)$, of length $2 - (-2) = 4$. The height is the vertical distance from the vertex $(0, -1)$ to the line $a_{2}=1$, which is $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n$$ \\mathcal{A}_{\\text{stable}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 \\times 2 = 4 $$\nThe coefficient pair $(a_1, a_2)$ is drawn uniformly from the rectangle $R = \\{(a_1, a_2) : -2 \\le a_1 \\le 2, -1.5 \\le a_2 \\le 1.5\\}$.\nThe area of this rectangle, $\\mathcal{A}_{\\text{rect}}$, is:\n$$ \\mathcal{A}_{\\text{rect}} = (2 - (-2)) \\times (1.5 - (-1.5)) = 4 \\times 3 = 12 $$\nTo find the probability, we must determine the area of the intersection of the stability triangle and the sampling rectangle. The triangle's $a_1$ coordinates range from $-2$ to $2$, which is fully contained within the rectangle's $a_1$ range of $[-2, 2]$. The triangle's $a_2$ coordinates range from $-1$ to $1$, which is fully contained within the rectangle's $a_2$ range of $[-1.5, 1.5]$. Therefore, the stability triangle lies entirely inside the sampling rectangle.\nThe probability of $p(z)$ being Schur stable is the ratio of the area of the stability region to the total area of the sampling region:\n$$ P(\\text{stable}) = \\frac{\\mathcal{A}_{\\text{stable}}}{\\mathcal{A}_{\\text{rect}}} = \\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nThis is the exact probability.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}} $$", "id": "2747062"}, {"introduction": "With the foundational principles established, we now move to a more comprehensive application of the stability test.

The leading coefficient $a_3=1$ is positive.\n\nThe necessary and sufficient conditions for Schur stability can be derived from a recursive procedure. The stability of $P_n(z)$ is equivalent to the satisfaction of $|a_0/a_n|  1$ and the Schur stability of a reduced-degree polynomial $P_{n-1}(z)$. Before applying the recursive step, two preliminary necessary conditions must be checked:\n1. $P_n(1)  0$\n2. $(-1)^n P_n(-1)  0$\n\nWe apply these conditions to the given polynomial $p(z)$.\n\nFirst necessary condition: $p(1)  0$.\n$$p(1) = (1)^3 + (1)^2 + (2-k)(1) + k = 1 + 1 + 2 - k + k = 4$$\nThe inequality $4  0$ is always satisfied and imposes no constraint on $k$.\n\nSecond necessary condition: For $n=3$, this is $(-1)^3 p(-1)  0$, or $p(-1)  0$.\n$$p(-1) = (-1)^3 + (-1)^2 + (2-k)(-1) + k = -1 + 1 - 2 + k + k = 2k - 2$$\nThe inequality $2k - 2  0$ simplifies to $2k  2$, which gives the constraint $k  1$.\n\nNow, we proceed to the recursive part of the test, as specified in the problem statement. The fundamental step of the recursion requires that the magnitude of the constant term be strictly less than the magnitude of the leading coefficient.\nFor $p(z)$, this is the condition $|a_0|  a_3$.\n$$|k|  1$$\nThis is equivalent to the interval $-1  k  1$. This condition is more restrictive than $k1$, so at this stage, the requirement for stability is $k \\in (-1, 1)$.\n\nThe next step is to construct the reduced-degree polynomial and check its stability. If $p(z)$ is Schur-stable, then the polynomial $p_2(z)$ derived from the following construction must also be Schur-stable.

A reliable way to avoid cancellation while preserving the validity of the endpoint test is to scale the variable by a factor $\\alpha1$, replacing $p(z)$ with $p(\\alpha z)$ and checking $p(\\alpha\\cdot 1)0$ instead, because the condition $p(1)0$ is invariant under such scaling.\n\nC. Interval arithmetic with directed rounding at $z=1$ and $z=-1$, or computing certified forward error bounds for the chosen evaluation algorithm (for example, Horner with a known error model), can provide a sign certificate: if the resulting enclosure for $p(1)$ or $(-1)^n p(-1)$ does not contain $0$, the sign decision is robust.\n\nD. Because $p(1)$ equals the sum of the coefficients and $p(-1)$ equals the alternating sum, reordering terms by magnitude and using pairwise or heap-based summation, possibly in extended precision, mitigates cancellation and can often certify the sign; if not, one should fall back to a more global stability check (for example, computing the full Jury table or the Schur–Cohn test) that does not rely solely on the endpoints.\n\nE.

For (i), using the forward error bound above with $x=1$, if $|p(1)|\\lesssim \\gamma_n \\sum |a_k|$, a sign flip is possible. This is the very definition of catastrophic cancellation: large partial sums cancel to produce a small result, so the relative error in the result can be large. For (ii), pairwise or Kahan-compensated summation reduces the effective constant from $\\gamma_{m-1}$ to a much smaller bound (compensated summation has a backward error on the order of $u^2$ under mild assumptions), but if the true $|p(1)|$ is still beneath any rigorous enclosure of the evaluation error, the sign remains undecidable. Therefore, Option A is Correct.\n\nOption B: This proposes replacing $p(z)$ by $p(\\alpha z)$ with $\\alpha1$ to avoid cancellation while preserving the validity of the original endpoint test. However, $p(1)$ pertains to the original polynomial that encodes the system’s characteristic equation. The map $z\\mapsto \\alpha z$ changes the polynomial and its relationship to the unit circle: $p(\\alpha z)$ does not share the same root set scaled in a way that preserves the stability region. Moreover, $p(\\alpha\\cdot 1)=p(\\alpha)$ is generally unrelated to $p(1)$; the sign of $p(\\alpha)$ cannot replace the required sign of $p(1)$. The endpoint conditions are not invariant under this change of variable. Hence Option B is Incorrect.\n\nOption C: Interval arithmetic constructs enclosures for the true value by carrying rounding outward. For example, evaluating $p(1)$ with directed rounding down and up yields an interval $[L,U]$ with $p(1)\\in[L,U]$. If $0\\notin[L,U]$, the sign is certified. Alternatively, using a proved forward error bound $|\\operatorname{fl}(p(1))-p(1)|\\le \\Delta$, one has $p(1)\\in [\\operatorname{fl}(p(1))-\\Delta, \\operatorname{fl}(p(1))+\\Delta]$, which again certifies the sign if the interval avoids $0$. The same logic applies to $(-1)^n p(-1)$. Therefore, Option C is Correct.\n\nOption D: From the definition of evaluation at $z=\\pm 1$, $p(1)$ is the sum of coefficients and $p(-1)$ is an alternating sum. Summing from smallest magnitude to largest magnitude and using pairwise or heap-based summation reduces rounding error by improving the conditioning of the summation process. Using extended precision (for example, quadruple precision or arbitrary precision) can further separate the true value from rounding noise, frequently enabling a sign certificate. If endpoint tests remain inconclusive, switching to a global stability test such as the full Jury table or the Schur–Cohn test is an acknowledged robust strategy, because those methods use additional information beyond the two endpoint evaluations and can succeed where an endpoint sign is numerically ambiguous. Thus, Option D is Correct.\n\nOption E: Random perturbations and majority voting are heuristic. Even if the majority of perturbations yield a particular sign, there is no guarantee that the unperturbed polynomial shares that sign at $z=\\pm 1$, and adversarial or worst-case perturbations may reverse it. Without rigorous uncertainty modeling and certification (for example, via probabilistic error bounds that guarantee a confidence level with explicit assumptions), a majority vote does not constitute a rigorous decision procedure. Therefore, Option E is Incorrect.\n\nIn summary, Options A, C, and D accurately characterize both the numerical sensitivity and robust strategies for deciding the endpoint sign tests when $p(1)\\approx 0$ or $p(-1)\\approx 0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2747054"}]}
