The control law is a static state-feedback law using a quantized measurement of the state:\n$$\nu_k = K\\,q(x_k),\n$$\nwhere $q(\\cdot)$ is a uniform midrise quantizer. The relationship between the state $x_k$ and its quantized value $q(x_k)$ can be expressed using the quantization error $e_k \\triangleq x_k - q(x_k)$. Thus, we can write $q(x_k) = x_k - e_k$.\n\nSubstituting the control law into the plant dynamics and using the definition of the quantization error, we obtain the closed-loop system dynamics:\n$$\nx_{k+1} = a\\,x_k + K(x_k - e_k) = (a+K)x_k - K\\,e_k.\n$$\nThis equation describes the evolution of the state under quantized feedback control.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the minimum integer number of quantization levels, $N_{\\min}$, for which practical stability of the origin can be achieved. According to the provided definition, practical stability necessitates the existence of a gain $K$ such that two conditions are met:\n$1$. The closed-loop trajectory remains inside the quantizer’s unsaturated range $[-R,R]$ for all time $k \\ge 0$, given the initial condition $x_0 \\in [-R,R]$. This is a set invariance condition.\n$2$. The trajectory is ultimately bounded within a neighborhood of the origin whose radius is proportional to the quantization step size $\\Delta$.\n\nLet us first analyze the ultimate boundedness condition. The dynamics are governed by $x_{k+1} = (a+K)x_k - K\\,e_k$. For the state to be bounded in the presence of the bounded disturbance-like term $-K\\,e_k$, the homogeneous part of the system, $x_{k+1} = (a+K)x_k$, must be asymptotically stable. This requires the pole of the nominal closed-loop system, $(a+K)$, to be inside the unit circle, which means:\n$$\n|a+K|  1.\n$$\n\nNow, we analyze the set invariance condition. We must ensure that if $|x_k| \\le R$, then $|x_{k+1}| \\le R$. Using the triangle inequality on the closed-loop dynamics, we have:\n$$\n|x_{k+1}| = |(a+K)x_k - K\\,e_k| \\le |a+K|\\,|x_k| + |K|\\,|e_k|.\n$$\nThe problem states that for an unsaturated measurement, i.e., for $|x_k| \\le R$, the quantization error is bounded by $|e_k| \\le \\Delta/2$. To guarantee that $|x_{k+1}| \\le R$ for any $|x_k| \\le R$, we must consider the worst-case scenario within this range, which occurs at the boundary $|x_k| = R$. Substituting the bounds $|x_k| \\le R$ and $|e_k| \\le \\Delta/2$ into the inequality yields:\n$$\n|x_{k+1}| \\le |a+K|\\,R + |K|\\,\\frac{\\Delta}{2}.\n$$\nFor the set $[-R,R]$ to be invariant, the right-hand side must be less than or equal to $R$:\n$$\n|a+K|\\,R + |K|\\,\\frac{\\Delta}{2} \\le R.\n$$\nSince $R > 0$, we can divide by $R$:\n$$\n|a+K| + |K|\\,\\frac{\\Delta}{2R} \\le 1.\n$$\nThe quantization step size is defined as $\\Delta = \\frac{2R}{N}$, so $\\frac{\\Delta}{2R} = \\frac{1}{N}$. Substituting this into the inequality gives:\n$$\n|a+K| + \\frac{|K|}{N} \\le 1.\n$$\n\nWe seek the minimum integer $N$ for which there exists a gain $K$ that satisfies both $|a+K|  1$ and $|a+K| + |K|/N \\le 1$. These two conditions can be combined. The second inequality can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\frac{|K|}{N} \\le 1 - |a+K|.\n$$\nSince $|a+K|1$, the term $1-|a+K|$ is strictly positive. Thus we can write:\n$$\nN \\ge \\frac{|K|}{1 - |a+K|}.\n$$\nFor such a gain $K$ to exist, the number of levels $N$ must be greater than or equal to the minimum possible value of the expression on the right-hand side. We must therefore find the minimum of the function $f(K) = \\frac{|K|}{1 - |a+K|}$ over the set of all stabilizing gains $K$, i.e., for $K$ such that $|a+K|  1$.\nLet $m = \\min_{K: |a+K|1} f(K)$. Then, we must have $N \\ge m$.\n\nLet's find this minimum value $m$. Let $\\lambda = a+K$. The constraint becomes $|\\lambda|  1$. The gain is $K = \\lambda - a$. The function to minimize is now a function of $\\lambda \\in (-1,1)$:\n$$\ng(\\lambda) = \\frac{|\\lambda - a|}{1 - |\\lambda|}.\n$$\nWe analyze this function based on the sign of $a$. Since $|a|1$, $a$ is non-zero.\nCase $1$: $a1$. For $\\lambda \\in (-1,1)$, $\\lambda-a$ is always negative, so $|\\lambda-a| = a-\\lambda$.\nThe function is $g(\\lambda) = \\frac{a-\\lambda}{1-|\\lambda|}$.\nFor $\\lambda \\in [0,1)$, $g(\\lambda) = \\frac{a-\\lambda}{1-\\lambda} = \\frac{a-1+1-\\lambda}{1-\\lambda} = \\frac{a-1}{1-\\lambda} + 1$. This function is monotonically increasing on $[0,1)$, so its minimum is at $\\lambda=0$, with value $g(0)=a$.\nFor $\\lambda \\in (-1,0)$, $g(\\lambda) = \\frac{a-\\lambda}{1+\\lambda} = \\frac{a+1-(\\lambda+1)}{1+\\lambda} = \\frac{a+1}{1+\\lambda} - 1$. This function is monotonically decreasing on $(-1,0)$, approaching its minimum as $\\lambda \\to 0^{-}$. The limit is $\\lim_{\\lambda \\to 0^{-}} g(\\lambda) = a$.\nThe infimum of $g(\\lambda)$ on $(-1,1)$ is therefore $a$, which is $|a|$.\n\nCase $2$: $a-1$. For $\\lambda \\in (-1,1)$, $\\lambda-a$ is always positive, so $|\\lambda-a| = \\lambda-a$.\nThe function is $g(\\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda-a}{1-|\\lambda|}$. Let $a' = -a  1$, so $g(\\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda+a'}{1-|\\lambda|}$.\nThis has the same form as in Case $1$ with $a$ replaced by $a'$ and $\\lambda$ by $-\\lambda$. The analysis is symmetric. Its minimum value is $a'$, which is $|a|$.\n\nIn both cases, the minimum value of the expression is $|a|$. This minimum is achieved for $\\lambda=0$, which corresponds to the gain choice $K = -a$.\nSo, we have established that for a stabilizing gain $K$ to exist that also guarantees the invariance of $[-R,R]$, we must satisfy the condition:\n$$\nN \\ge |a|.\n$$\nSince $N$ must be an integer, the minimum possible value for $N$ is the smallest integer greater than or equal to $|a|$. This is given by the ceiling function:\n$$\nN_{\\min} = \\lceil |a| \\rceil.\n$$\nWith this minimum $N$ (or any $N \\ge N_{\\min}$), we can choose the gain $K=-a$. This satisfies $|a+K|=01$. The invariance condition becomes $0 + |-a|/N \\le 1$, or $|a| \\le N$, which is satisfied by our choice of $N$. Finally, with $K=-a$, the dynamics are $x_{k+1}=ae_k$. Since $|e_k| \\le \\Delta/2$, we have $|x_{k+1}| \\le |a|\\frac{\\Delta}{2}$. This shows that any trajectory starting in $[-R,R]$ enters the set $[-|a|\\frac{\\Delta}{2}, |a|\\frac{\\Delta}{2}]$ in one step and remains there. This satisfies the ultimate boundedness requirement, with the radius of the bounding set being proportional to $\\Delta$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum integer number of quantization levels is indeed $\\lceil |a| \\rceil$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\lceil |a| \\rceil}\n$$", "id": "2696268"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond the static view of a quantizer, we can adopt a more dynamic, information-theoretic perspective.

The plant is open-loop unstable in discrete time. The controller receives at each sampling time an $R$-bit description of $x_k$ produced by a uniform scalar quantizer with dynamic range adjustment. We will reason via uncertainty sets and their diameters.\n\nDefine $D_k \\ge 0$ as the diameter (length) of the smallest interval known to both encoder and decoder at time $k$ that is guaranteed to contain the true state $x_k$ before quantization at time $k$. The uniform quantizer with $2^R$ bins partitions that interval into $2^R$ equal subintervals. Upon transmitting the bin index, both encoder and decoder know that $x_k$ lies within the selected subinterval, whose diameter is\n$$d_k = \\frac{D_k}{2^R}.$$\nThus, quantization reduces the state uncertainty diameter from $D_k$ to $d_k$ by a factor of $2^{-R}$.\n\nWe now consider the control action and the plant propagation. Let $\\hat{x}_k$ be the reconstruction at the controller, taken as any point in the post-quantization subinterval (for instance, its midpoint).

Therefore, the prior-to-quantization uncertainty diameter at time $k+1$ is\n$$D_{k+1} = |a|\\,d_k = |a|\\,\\frac{D_k}{2^R}.$$\n\nThis recursion for the uncertainty diameter across one sampling period captures two fundamental effects: the $R$-bit uniform quantizer reduces the diameter by a factor of $2^R$, while the open-loop plant dynamics expand it by a factor of $|a|$. A necessary condition for asymptotic stabilization (and, as we will show, also sufficient via the above dynamic quantization and control) is that the uncertainty diameter contracts on average, that is,\n$$\\frac{D_{k+1}}{D_k} = \\frac{|a|}{2^R}  1.$$\nEquivalently,\n$$2^R  |a| \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad R  \\log_{2}(|a|).$$\n\nSufficiency follows because when $|a|/2^R  1$, the diameter satisfies\n$$D_{k+1} = \\left(\\frac{|a|}{2^R}\\right) D_k,$$\nso $D_k$ decays geometrically to zero.

The state variable $s(t)$ will increase, drifting towards the upper boundary of the dead zone, $s = \\frac{\\Delta}{2}$.\nNow, consider the behavior at the surface $s = \\frac{\\Delta}{2}$.\nFor $s \\to (\\frac{\\Delta}{2})^{+}$ (from the right), the dynamics are $\\dot{s} = w - b\\,k  0$.\nFor $s \\to (\\frac{\\Delta}{2})^{-}$ (from the left, within the dead zone), the dynamics are $\\dot{s} = w  0$.\nSince the vector field on each side of the surface $s = \\frac{\\Delta}{2}$ points towards the surface, a stable sliding motion is established on this surface. The state trajectory, regardless of its initial condition, will converge to and remain at $s(t) = \\frac{\\Delta}{2}$.\nThus, for $w0$, we have $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} s(t) = \\frac{\\Delta}{2}$.\n\nCase 2: $w  0$.\nSimilarly, trajectories starting outside the dead zone are driven towards it.\nInside the dead zone, $s(t) \\in [-\\frac{\\Delta}{2}, \\frac{\\Delta}{2})$, the dynamics are $\\dot{s} = w  0$. The state variable $s(t)$ will decrease, drifting towards the lower boundary of the dead zone, $s = -\\frac{\\Delta}{2}$.\nNow, consider the behavior at the surface $s = -\\frac{\\Delta}{2}$.\nFor $s \\to (-\\frac{\\Delta}{2})^{-}$ (from the left), the dynamics are $\\dot{s} = w + b\\,k  0$.\nFor $s \\to (-\\frac{\\Delta}{2})^{+}$ (from the right, within the dead zone), the dynamics are $\\dot{s} = w  0$.\nA stable sliding motion is established on the surface $s = -\\frac{\\Delta}{2}$.

In an ideal (non-quantized) case, sliding occurs at $s=0$, and the equivalent control $u_{eq}$ required to maintain $\\dot{s}=0$ is found from $0 = b\\,u_{eq} + w$, giving $u_{eq} = -w/b$.\nIn our quantized system, for $w0$, sliding occurs at $s=\\Delta/2$. The control switches between $u=0$ and $u=-k$. The Filippov convex combination gives $\\dot{s} = \\lambda(-b\\,k+w) + (1-\\lambda)w = 0$ for some duty cycle $\\lambda \\in (0,1)$. This yields $-\\lambda b k + w = 0$, so $\\lambda = w/(bk)$. The time-averaged equivalent control is $u_{eq} = \\lambda(-k) + (1-\\lambda)(0) = -\\lambda k = -w/b$.\nFor $w0$, sliding occurs at $s=-\\Delta/2$. The control switches between $u=0$ and $u=k$. The combination is $\\lambda(b\\,k+w) + (1-\\lambda)w = 0$, which yields $\\lambda = -w/(bk)$. The equivalent control is $u_{eq} = \\lambda(k) + (1-\\lambda)(0) = \\lambda k = -w/b$.\nIn both cases, the value of the equivalent control is identical to the ideal case. The effect of quantization is not to alter the equivalent control value, but to shift the sliding surface from the desired $s=0$ to $s=\\pm\\frac{\\Delta}{2}$, inducing a steady-state error.\n\nThe problem defines the chattering amplitude as $A = \\limsup_{t\\to\\infty} |s(t)|$.\nSince the state $s(t)$ converges to a constant value $s_{ss}$ in both cases, the limit superior is simply the absolute value of this steady-state value.\nFor $w0$, $s_{ss} = \\frac{\\Delta}{2}$, so $A = \\left|\\frac{\\Delta}{2}\\right| = \\frac{\\Delta}{2}$.\nFor $w0$, $s_{ss} = -\\frac{\\Delta}{2}$, so $A = \\left|-\\frac{\\Delta}{2}\\right| = \\frac{\\Delta}{2}$.\nThe amplitude of this steady-state deviation from the ideal surface $s=0$ is therefore independent of the specific value or sign of the disturbance $w$ (as long as $w \\neq 0$). This steady-state error is what is referred to as the chattering amplitude in this context.
