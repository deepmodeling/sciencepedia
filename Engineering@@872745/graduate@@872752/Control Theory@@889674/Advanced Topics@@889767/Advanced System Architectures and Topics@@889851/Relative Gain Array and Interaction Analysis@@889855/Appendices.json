We begin with a critical validation of the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we extract the givens verbatim:\n1.  The system is a steady-state linear Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) plant.\n2.  The plant gain matrix is a constant $G \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times 2}$ given by $G = \\begin{bmatrix} 2  -1 \\\\ 3  4 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n3.  The Relative Gain Array (RGA), $\\Lambda$, is defined as being \"constructed from the plant’s steady-state gain matrix and its inverse through elementwise products\". This phrasing, in the context of control theory, unambiguously refers to the Hadamard product of the gain matrix $G$ and the transpose of its inverse, $(G^{-1})^T$.\n4.  The tasks are to compute $\\Lambda$, interpret its entries for control loop pairing, and report the value of the entry $\\lambda_{12}$.\n\nNext, we validate the problem's integrity.\nThe problem is **scientifically grounded** as the RGA is a fundamental and widely used tool in chemical process control and other engineering disciplines for interaction analysis. The problem is **well-posed**: the given matrix $G$ is a non-singular square matrix, which guarantees the existence of a unique inverse and thus a unique RGA matrix. The determinant is $\\det(G) = (2)(4) - (-1)(3) = 8 + 3 = 11 \\neq 0$. The tasks are clear and lead to a unique solution. The language is **objective** and free from ambiguity or subjective claims. The problem is complete and internally consistent.\n\nThe verdict is that the problem is **valid**. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the Relative Gain Array (RGA) matrix, denoted $\\Lambda$, for the given steady-state gain matrix $G$. The definition of the RGA is:\n$$\n\\Lambda(G) = G \\circ (G^{-1})^T\n$$\nwhere $\\circ$ represents the elementwise product, or Hadamard product.\n\nFirst, we must compute the inverse of the matrix $G$. For a general $2 \\times 2$ matrix $A = \\begin{bmatrix} a  b \\\\ c  d \\end{bmatrix}$, its inverse is given by the formula:\n$$\nA^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(A)} \\begin{bmatrix} d  -b \\\\ -c  a \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nFor our given matrix $G = \\begin{bmatrix} 2  -1 \\\\ 3  4 \\end{bmatrix}$, the determinant is:\n$$\n\\det(G) = (2)(4) - (-1)(3) = 8 + 3 = 11\n$$\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse exists. Applying the formula:\n$$\nG^{-1} = \\frac{1}{11} \\begin{bmatrix} 4  -(-1) \\\\ -3  2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{11} \\begin{bmatrix} 4  1 \\\\ -3  2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{4}{11}  \\frac{1}{11} \\\\ -\\frac{3}{11}  \\frac{2}{11} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute the transpose of this inverse matrix, $(G^{-1})^T$:\n$$\n(G^{-1})^T = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{4}{11}  -\\frac{3}{11} \\\\ \\frac{1}{11}  \\frac{2}{11} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we can compute the RGA matrix $\\Lambda$ using the Hadamard product:\n$$\n\\Lambda = G \\circ (G^{-1})^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 2  -1 \\\\ 3  4 \\end{bmatrix} \\circ \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{4}{11}  -\\frac{3}{11} \\\\ \\frac{1}{11}  \\frac{2}{11} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nPerforming the elementwise multiplication:\n$$\n\\Lambda = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\cdot \\frac{4}{11}  (-1) \\cdot (-\\frac{3}{11}) \\\\ 3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{11}  4 \\cdot \\frac{2}{11} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{8}{11}  \\frac{3}{11} \\\\ \\frac{3}{11}  \\frac{8}{11} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the task. As requested, we verify a fundamental structural identity of the RGA: that the sum of the elements in each row and each column must equal $1$.\nFor Row 1: $\\frac{8}{11} + \\frac{3}{11} = \\frac{11}{11} = 1$.\nFor Row 2: $\\frac{3}{11} + \\frac{8}{11} = \\frac{11}{11} = 1$.\nFor Column 1: $\\frac{8}{11} + \\frac{3}{11} = \\frac{11}{11} = 1$.\nFor Column 2: $\\frac{3}{11} + \\frac{8}{11} = \\frac{11}{11} = 1$.\nThis property is satisfied, which serves as a necessary check on our calculation.\n\nThe second part of the task is the interpretation of $\\Lambda$. The element $\\lambda_{ij}$ represents the ratio of the open-loop gain between input $u_j$ and output $y_i$ to the closed-loop gain for the same pair when all other loops are under perfect control.\n$$\n\\lambda_{ij} = \\frac{(\\partial y_i / \\partial u_j)_{u_k=\\text{const}, k \\neq j}}{(\\partial y_i / \\partial u_j)_{y_k=\\text{const}, k \\neq i}}\n$$\nThe interpretation rules are as follows:\n- **Pairing Recommendation**: Inputs and outputs should be paired to control loops such that the corresponding diagonal elements of the reordered $\\Lambda$ matrix are positive and as close to $1$ as possible.\n- **$\\lambda_{ij}  0$**: The sign of the gain from $u_j$ to $y_i$ is the same in open-loop and closed-loop configurations. A positive value is a prerequisite for a stable pairing. A negative value ($\\lambda_{ij}  0$) indicates that closing other loops will reverse the sign of the process gain, which can cause severe instability. The controller would fight the process.\n- **$\\lambda_{ij} \\approx 1$**: Low interaction from other loops on the $y_i$-$u_j$ pair. This is the most desirable case for pairing.\n- **$\\lambda_{ij} \\approx 0$**: Strong interaction. Closing other loops nearly eliminates the effect of $u_j$ on $y_i$. This pairing is highly undesirable.\n- **$\\lambda_{ij} = 0.5$**: Marks a high degree of interaction. For a $2 \\times 2$ system, if one diagonal element is $0.5$, all are $0.5$.\n- **$\\lambda_{ij}  1$**: Indicates that closing other loops amplifies the effect of $u_j$ on $y_i$. Interaction is present, but often manageable.\n\nFor our computed RGA matrix $\\Lambda = \\begin{bmatrix} 8/11  3/11 \\\\ 3/11  8/11 \\end{bmatrix}$:\nAll entries are positive, which means no control loop will experience a sign change in its effective gain due to the action of other loops. This is a favorable condition.\nWe consider two possible pairing strategies:\n1.  Diagonal pairing: ($y_1-u_1$, $y_2-u_2$). The corresponding RGA elements are $\\lambda_{11} = 8/11$ and $\\lambda_{22} = 8/11$.\n2.  Off-diagonal pairing: ($y_1-u_2$, $y_2-u_1$). The corresponding RGA elements are $\\lambda_{12} = 3/11$ and $\\lambda_{21} = 3/11$.\n\nSince $8/11 \\approx 0.727$ is closer to $1$ than $3/11 \\approx 0.273$, the diagonal pairing ($y_1-u_1$, $y_2-u_2$) is the preferred configuration. It minimizes steady-state interaction between the control loops. The values are not extremely close to $1$, suggesting that a moderate level of interaction will still be present, but this pairing is nonetheless the superior choice.\n\nThe final answer required is the value of the off-diagonal entry $\\lambda_{12}$. From our computation, this is $\\frac{3}{11}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{3}{11}}\n$$", "id": "2739795"}, {"introduction": "To build deeper intuition, this practice explores a system with a particularly illustrative structure. By analyzing a plant whose gain matrix is a permutation matrix, we can see the physical meaning of RGA elements being exactly $1$ or $0$ [@problem_id:2739809].

Then, based on your computed $\\Lambda$, reason about the input-output pairing that minimizes loop interaction under decentralized control and discuss whether a permutation of input and output channels can render the steady-state gain effectively diagonal. If such a permutation exists, identify the permutation matrix and state the resulting permuted steady-state gain and permuted relative gain array.\n\nAs a single scalar summary to be reported as your final numerical answer, compute the determinant of the RGA, $\\det(\\Lambda)$. Do not round your result.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard exercise in multivariable control theory and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. Therefore, I will proceed with its resolution.\n\nThe problem requires the analysis of a two-input two-output linear time-invariant system at steady state, described by the gain matrix:\n$$\nG = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe primary tool for this analysis is the Relative Gain Array (RGA), denoted by $\\Lambda$. The RGA is defined by the element-wise (Hadamard) product of the gain matrix $G$ and its inverse-transpose. The formula for the RGA matrix $\\Lambda$ is:\n$$\n\\Lambda = G \\circ (G^{-1})^T\n$$\nwhere $\\circ$ denotes the Hadamard product. Each element $\\lambda_{ij}$ of the RGA is given by the ratio of the open-loop gain between input $u_j$ and output $y_i$ to the closed-loop gain between the same pair when all other loops are closed.\n\nFirst, we must compute the inverse of the gain matrix $G$. The determinant of $G$ is:\n$$\n\\det(G) = (0)(0) - (1)(1) = -1\n$$\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the matrix is invertible. The inverse is given by:\n$$\nG^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(G)} \\begin{bmatrix} 0  -1 \\\\ -1  0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{-1} \\begin{bmatrix} 0  -1 \\\\ -1  0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nWe observe that $G^{-1} = G$. This is a property of this specific permutation matrix.\n\nNext, we find the transpose of the inverse matrix, $(G^{-1})^T$:\n$$\n(G^{-1})^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{bmatrix}^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThus, we have $(G^{-1})^T = G^{-1} = G$.\n\nNow, we can compute the RGA matrix $\\Lambda$ using the Hadamard product:\n$$\n\\Lambda = G \\circ (G^{-1})^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{bmatrix} \\circ \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\cdot 0  1 \\cdot 1 \\\\ 1 \\cdot 1  0 \\cdot 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe computed relative gain array is $\\Lambda = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nThe RGA is used to determine the best input-output pairing for decentralized control. The pairing rule is to select pairs $(u_j, y_i)$ for which the corresponding RGA element $\\lambda_{ij}$ is positive and close to $1$. Elements close to $0$ indicate strong interaction and poor control, while negative elements indicate that closing the loop will destabilize the system or result in inverse response.\nFor the pairing $u_1 \\to y_1$ and $u_2 \\to y_2$, we look at the diagonal elements of $\\Lambda$: $\\lambda_{11} = 0$ and $\\lambda_{22} = 0$. An RGA element of $0$ signifies that the designated input has no steady-state effect on the designated output when other loops are open, but gains control authority through interactions when other loops are closed. This is an extremely undesirable pairing.\nFor the pairing $u_1 \\to y_2$ and $u_2 \\to y_1$, we consider the RGA elements $\\lambda_{21} = 1$ and $\\lambda_{12} = 1$. An RGA element of $1$ signifies no interaction from other control loops at steady state. This is the ideal situation. Therefore, the correct pairing to minimize loop interaction is $u_1$ with $y_2$ and $u_2$ with $y_1$.\n\nThe problem then asks if a permutation of channels can render the gain matrix diagonal. The current gain matrix $G = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{bmatrix}$ is not diagonal. The optimal pairing $u_1 \\to y_2, u_2 \\to y_1$ suggests that if we were to re-label the outputs such that the new first output $y'_1$ is the old second output $y_2$, and the new second output $y'_2$ is the old first output $y_1$, the system would become diagonal.\nThis re-labeling corresponds to permuting the rows of the gain matrix. The permutation matrix $P$ that swaps the two rows is:\n$$\nP = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe permuted steady-state gain matrix, $G'$, is given by $G' = P G$:\n$$\nG' = P G = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} (0)(0) + (1)(1)  (0)(1) + (1)(0) \\\\ (1)(0) + (0)(1)  (1)(1) + (0)(0) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{bmatrix} = I\n$$\nThe resulting permuted gain matrix is the identity matrix $I$, which is diagonal. This confirms that such a permutation exists.\nThe permuted relative gain array, $\\Lambda'$, can be computed from $G' = I$.\n$$\n(G')^{-1} = I^{-1} = I \\quad \\text{and} \\quad ((G')^{-1})^T = I^T = I\n$$\n$$\n\\Lambda' = G' \\circ ((G')^{-1})^T = I \\circ I = \\begin{bmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{bmatrix} \\circ \\begin{bmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{bmatrix} = I\n$$\nThis permuted RGA confirms that the new pairing ($u_1 \\to y'_1$, $u_2 \\to y'_2$) is perfectly decoupled.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the determinant of the original RGA, $\\det(\\Lambda)$.\n$$\n\\det(\\Lambda) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} = (0)(0) - (1)(1) = -1\n$$\nThis property, $\\det(\\Lambda)=\\det(G)$, is not general but holds in this specific case because $G=G^{-1}$. The determinant of an RGA is not directly used for pairing but is a property of the array. The sum of each row and column of any RGA must be $1$, which is satisfied here: $0+1=1$ and $1+0=1$.\nThe required scalar summary is the determinant of the original RGA.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-1}\n$$", "id": "2739809"}, {"introduction": "Perhaps the most critical application of RGA analysis is identifying non-obvious stability issues.

For decentralized control, one seeks to pair inputs and outputs such that the corresponding diagonal elements of $\\Lambda(G)$ are positive and close to $1$. The proposed pairing is $y_1-u_1$ and $y_2-u_2$. The corresponding RGA elements are $\\lambda_{11}$ and $\\lambda_{22}$. We found that $\\lambda_{11} = \\lambda_{22} = -2/3$. A negative relative gain indicates a severe problem for decentralized control.\nThe physical meaning of $\\lambda_{11}  0$ is that the gain of the process from $u_1$ to $y_1$ reverses its sign when the second loop $(y_2, u_2)$ is closed, compared to when it is open.\nThe open-loop gain is $g_{11} = 4$, which is positive.\nThe closed-loop gain is $(\\partial y_1 / \\partial u_1)_{y_2=\\text{const}} = \\det(G)/g_{22} = -0.6/0.1 = -6$, which is negative.\nThis sign reversal is extremely risky. A controller for the first loop, designed assuming a positive process gain (as is the case in open loop), would provide incorrect control action when the second loop is closed and active. For example, a proportional controller with positive gain would create positive feedback, leading to instability. Therefore, even though all steady-state gains $g_{ij}$ are positive, the strong interaction between the loops makes the diagonal pairing $y_1-u_1, y_2-u_2$ fundamentally flawed and likely unstable. The alternative pairing, $y_1-u_2$ and $y_2-u_1$, corresponds to $\\lambda_{12}=\\lambda_{21}=5/3$, which, being positive, is a much better choice, although the deviation from $1$ still indicates significant interaction.\n\nFinally, we compute the Niederlinski index $N$. This index provides a necessary condition for the stability of a decentralized control system with integral action. For a diagonal pairing, stability requires $N  0$. The definition is:\n$$\nN = \\frac{\\det(G)}{\\prod_{i=1}^{2} g_{ii}}\n$$\nWe have already calculated the necessary components:\n$$\n\\det(G) = -0.6\n$$\n$$\n\\prod_{i=1}^{2} g_{ii} = g_{11} g_{22} = (4)(0.1) = 0.4\n$$\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\nN = \\frac{-0.6}{0.4} = -\\frac{6}{4} = -\\frac{3}{2} = -1.5\n$$\nSince $N  0$, the Niederlinski stability criterion is not satisfied. This confirms that a decentralized control system implementing the pairing $y_1-u_1, y_2-u_2$ with integral controllers would be unstable at steady state. This result provides rigorous, quantitative certification of the pairing's fragility, which was indicated by the negative elements of the RGA.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{3}{2}}\n$$", "id": "2739824"}]}
