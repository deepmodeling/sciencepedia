It is based on fundamental principles of linear systems theory and robust control, specifically the concepts of impulse response, the $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norm of an LTI system, and the small-gain theorem. All terms are standard and well-defined in the field of control theory. The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary definitions and context to proceed with both the calculation and the explanation. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies. The problem is a standard exercise in robust and adaptive control theory. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe task is twofold: first, to compute the $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norm of the given low-pass filter, and second, to explain the origin of the small-gain stability condition in this context.\n\nPart 1: Computation of $\\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1}$.\nThe transfer function of the filter is given by $C(s) = \\dfrac{\\omega_c}{s + \\omega_c}$. The impulse response $h(t)$ is the inverse Laplace transform of $C(s)$. For a causal system, this is:\n$$\nh(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{ C(s) \\right\\}(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{ \\frac{\\omega_c}{s + \\omega_c} \\right\\}(t)\n$$\nUsing the standard Laplace transform pair $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{ \\frac{1}{s+a} \\right\\}(t) = \\exp(-at)u(t)$, where $u(t)$ is the Heaviside step function, we find:\n$$\nh(t) = \\omega_c \\exp(-\\omega_c t) u(t)\n$$\nThe $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norm is defined as the integral of the absolute value of the impulse response.\n$$\n\\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |h(t)| \\,\\mathrm{d}t = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |\\omega_c \\exp(-\\omega_c t)| \\,\\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nGiven the constraint $\\omega_c  0$, and for the domain of integration $t \\ge 0$, the term $\\omega_c \\exp(-\\omega_c t)$ is always non-negative. Therefore, the absolute value is redundant.\n$$\n\\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\omega_c \\exp(-\\omega_c t) \\,\\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nWe evaluate this definite integral:\n$$\n\\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = \\omega_c \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(-\\omega_c t)}{-\\omega_c} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = \\left[ -\\exp(-\\omega_c t) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty}\n$$\n$$\n\\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = \\left( -\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\exp(-\\omega_c t) \\right) - \\left( -\\exp(-\\omega_c \\cdot 0) \\right)\n$$\nSince $\\omega_c  0$, the limit term evaluates to $0$. The second term is $-\\exp(0) = -1$.\n$$\n\\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = (0) - (-1) = 1\n$$\nThe $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norm of the given low-pass filter is exactly $1$.\n\nPart 2: Explanation of the small-gain condition.\nConsider a negative feedback system where the forward path is the stable LTI operator $C$ and the feedback path contains a bounded, memoryless uncertainty, which we will denote by an operator $\\Delta$. Let the external input to the system be $r(t)$ and the output of the LTI operator be $y(t)$. The input to the operator $C$ is an error signal $e(t) = r(t) - w(t)$, where $w(t)$ is the output of the uncertainty block $\\Delta$. The input to the uncertainty block is the output of the operator $C$, so $w(t) = (\\Delta y)(t)$.\n\nThe system dynamics are described by the equation:\n$$\ny(t) = (C * e)(t) = (C * (r - \\Delta y))(t)\n$$\nwhere $*$ denotes convolution. We analyze the stability in the space of bounded signals, using the $\\mathcal{L}_{\\infty}$ norm, defined as $\\lVert x \\rVert_{\\infty} = \\sup_{t \\ge 0} |x(t)|$.\nTaking the $\\mathcal{L}_{\\infty}$ norm of the system equation:\n$$\n\\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty} = \\lVert C * (r - \\Delta y) \\rVert_{\\infty}\n$$\nUsing the given induced norm bound property for LTI systems, which is a key result from convolution system theory ($\\lVert C*u \\rVert_{\\infty} \\le \\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} \\lVert u \\rVert_{\\infty}$), we have:\n$$\n\\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty} \\le \\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} \\lVert r - \\Delta y \\rVert_{\\infty}\n$$\nApplying the triangle inequality for norms to the right-hand side:\n$$\n\\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty} \\le \\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} \\left( \\lVert r \\rVert_{\\infty} + \\lVert \\Delta y \\rVert_{\\infty} \\right)\n$$\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta$ is stated to be memoryless with a gain of at most $L$. This property is formally expressed as:\n$$\n\\lVert \\Delta y \\rVert_{\\infty} \\le L \\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty}\n$$\nSubstituting this bound into our main inequality yields:\n$$\n\\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty} \\le \\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} \\left( \\lVert r \\rVert_{\\infty} + L \\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty} \\right)\n$$\nDistributing the term $\\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1}$:\n$$\n\\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty} \\le \\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} \\lVert r \\rVert_{\\infty} + \\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} L \\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty}\n$$\nTo solve for a bound on $\\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty}$, we gather terms involving $\\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty}$:\n$$\n\\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty} - \\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} L \\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty} \\le \\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} \\lVert r \\rVert_{\\infty}\n$$\n$$\n\\left( 1 - \\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} L \\right) \\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty} \\le \\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} \\lVert r \\rVert_{\\infty}\n$$\nFor the closed-loop system to be BIBO stable, a bounded input $r$ (i.e., $\\lVert r \\rVert_{\\infty}  \\infty$) must produce a bounded output $y$ (i.e., $\\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty}  \\infty$). This is guaranteed if we can express $\\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty}$ as being less than or equal to a finite constant multiplied by $\\lVert r \\rVert_{\\infty}$.\nTo isolate $\\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty}$ in the inequality above, we must divide by the term $(1 - \\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} L)$. For this division to be valid and preserve the inequality direction while ensuring a positive finite bound, the coefficient must be strictly positive:\n$$\n1 - \\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} L  0\n$$\nThis directly yields the sufficient condition for stability:\n$$\n\\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} L  1\n$$\nThis is the small-gain theorem: the loop is stable if the product of the gains of the components in the loop ($\\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1}$ for the LTI part and $L$ for the uncertainty) is less than one.

Substituting the given expressions for $C(s)$, $K(s)$, and $W(s)$ into the definition of $G(s)$, and using $I=1$ for the SISO case, we obtain:\n$$\nG(s) = \\left(\\frac{1}{s+2}\\right) (1+k)^{-1} \\left(\\frac{1}{s+1}\\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nG(s) = \\frac{1}{(1+k)(s+1)(s+2)}\n$$\nThis expression is valid for $k \\neq -1$. The poles of $G(s)$ are at $s=-1$ and $s=-2$, which are in the open left-half plane, consistent with the problem's stability assumption.\n\nSecond, we compute the $\\mathcal{L}_{1}$-norm of $G(s)$.

Therefore, its $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norm is equal to its DC gain.\n$$ \\lVert C_{1} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |\\omega_{c} e^{-\\omega_{c} t}| \\, \\mathrm{d}t = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\omega_{c} e^{-\\omega_{c} t} \\, \\mathrm{d}t = C_{1}(0) = \\dfrac{\\omega_{c}}{0+\\omega_{c}} = 1 $$\nThus, $\\lVert C_{1} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = 1$.\n\n**For $C_{2}(s)$:**\nThe transfer function is $C_{2}(s) = \\dfrac{\\omega_{c}^{2}}{s^{2} + \\sqrt{2}\\,\\omega_{c}\\,s + \\omega_{c}^{2}}$. This is a standard second-order system with natural frequency $\\omega_n = \\omega_c$ and damping ratio $\\zeta = 1/\\sqrt{2}$. Since $0  \\zeta  1$, the system is underdamped. The impulse response is:\n$$c_{2}(t) = \\frac{\\omega_n}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}} e^{-\\zeta\\omega_n t} \\sin(\\omega_d t) u(t)$$\nwhere $\\omega_d = \\omega_n \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}$. Substituting $\\omega_n = \\omega_c$ and $\\zeta=1/\\sqrt{2}$:\n$\\omega_d = \\omega_c \\sqrt{1 - (1/\\sqrt{2})^2} = \\omega_c \\sqrt{1/2} = \\omega_c/\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe pre-factor is $\\frac{\\omega_c}{\\sqrt{1/2}} = \\sqrt{2}\\omega_c$.\nSo, the impulse response is:\n$$c_{2}(t) = \\sqrt{2} \\omega_{c} e^{-\\frac{\\omega_{c}}{\\sqrt{2}}t} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{c}}{\\sqrt{2}}t\\right) u(t)$$\nDue to the $\\sin(\\cdot)$ term, $c_{2}(t)$ is not non-negative for all $t \\ge 0$. It oscillates. Therefore, its $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norm will be strictly greater than the absolute value of its DC gain:\n$$ \\lVert C_{2} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |c_{2}(t)| \\, \\mathrm{d}t  \\left| \\int_{0}^{\\infty} c_{2}(t) \\, \\mathrm{d}t \\right| = |C_{2}(0)| = 1 $$\nThe exact value of the integral is a known result for a second-order system with $\\zeta = 1/\\sqrt{2}$:\n$$ \\lVert C_{2} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\pi\\zeta}{2\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}}\\right) = \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\pi (1/\\sqrt{2})}{2\\sqrt{1-(1/\\sqrt{2})^2}}\\right) = \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\pi/\\sqrt{2}}{2(1/\\sqrt{2})}\\right) = \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) $$\nNumerically, $\\coth(\\pi/2) = \\dfrac{e^{\\pi/2} + e^{-\\pi/2}}{e^{\\pi/2} - e^{-\\pi/2}} \\approx \\dfrac{4.8105 + 0.2079}{4.8105 - 0.2079} \\approx 1.09034$.\nSo, we have $\\lVert C_{1} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = 1$ and $\\lVert C_{2} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} \\approx 1.0904$.\n\n**2. Comparison of Phase Lags**\n\nThe phase lag of a transfer function $H(s)$ at frequency $\\omega$ is given by $\\angle H(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)$.\n\n**For $C_{1}(s)$:**\n$C_{1}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega) = \\dfrac{\\omega_{c}}{\\mathrm{j}\\omega+\\omega_{c}}$.\nThe phase is $\\angle C_{1}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega) = -\\arctan(\\omega/\\omega_{c})$.\nAt the cutoff frequency $\\omega = \\omega_{c}$:\n$$\\angle C_{1}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega_{c}) = -\\arctan(\\omega_{c}/\\omega_{c}) = -\\arctan(1) = -\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\text{ rad}$$\n\n**For $C_{2}(s)$:**\n$C_{2}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega) = \\dfrac{\\omega_{c}^{2}}{(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)^{2} + \\sqrt{2}\\,\\omega_{c}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega) + \\omega_{c}^{2}} = \\dfrac{\\omega_{c}^{2}}{(\\omega_{c}^{2} - \\omega^2) + \\mathrm{j}\\sqrt{2}\\omega_{c}\\omega}$.\nThe phase is $\\angle C_{2}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega) = -\\arctan\\left(\\dfrac{\\sqrt{2}\\omega_{c}\\omega}{\\omega_{c}^{2} - \\omega^2}\\right)$.\nAt the cutoff frequency $\\omega = \\omega_{c}$, the real part of the denominator becomes zero:\n$$C_{2}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega_{c}) = \\dfrac{\\omega_{c}^{2}}{0 + \\mathrm{j}\\sqrt{2}\\omega_{c}^{2}} = \\dfrac{1}{\\mathrm{j}\\sqrt{2}} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{j}}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nThe phase of this complex number is:\n$$\\angle C_{2}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega_{c}) = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\text{ rad}$$\nComparing the phase lags at $\\omega = \\omega_c$, the lag from $C_{2}(s)$ ($|-\\pi/2| = \\pi/2$) is greater than the lag from $C_{1}(s)$ ($|-\\pi/4| = \\pi/4$).\n\n**3. Comparison of Robustness Margins**\n\nThe problem states that the robustness margin $\\bar{L}$ is inversely proportional to $\\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1}$.\nWe have found that $\\lVert C_{1} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = 1$ and $\\lVert C_{2} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} \\approx 1.0904$.\nSince $\\lVert C_{1} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1}  \\lVert C_{2} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1}$, the design using the first-order filter $C_{1}(s)$ yields a larger small-gain robustness margin than the design using the second-order Butterworth filter $C_{2}(s)$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $\\,\\lVert C_{1} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = 1$ and $\\,\\lVert C_{2} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} \\approx 1.0904 \\gt 1$; the Butterworth filter $C_{2}$ exhibits larger phase lag near $\\omega \\approx \\omega_{c}$ (e.g., $\\angle C_{1}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega_{c}) = -\\pi/4$ versus $\\angle C_{2}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega_{c}) = -\\pi/2$); therefore, for the same architecture and uncertainty scaling, the first-order $C_{1}$ yields a larger small-gain robustness margin.**\n- The $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norms are correct as derived: $\\lVert C_{1} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = 1$ and $\\lVert C_{2} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} \\approx 1.0904$.\n- The phase lag comparison is correct: At $\\omega = \\omega_c$, $\\angle C_{2}$ is $-\\pi/2$, which is a larger lag than $\\angle C_{1}$'s $-\\pi/4$.\n- The conclusion about the robustness margin is correct: A smaller $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norm implies a larger margin, so $C_{1}$ is superior in this regard.\nThis statement is fully consistent with our derivations.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $\\,\\lVert C_{1} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = \\lVert C_{2} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1}$ because both have the same DC gain; the Butterworth $C_{2}$ yields less phase lag in the passband due to maximal flatness; consequently, both designs have the same robustness margin.**\n- `$\\lVert C_{1} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = \\lVert C_{2} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1}$`: Incorrect. We found $1 \\neq 1.0904$. The reason given, \"because both have the same DC gain\", is a logical fallacy; the $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norm equals the DC gain only for systems with non-negative impulse responses.\n- `less phase lag`: Incorrect. At $\\omega_c$, $C_2$ has more phase lag. The \"maximal flatness\" of a Butterworth filter applies to the magnitude response at $\\omega=0$, not the phase response across the passband.\n- `same robustness margin`: Incorrect, as it follows from the incorrect premise about the norms.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The Butterworth $C_{2}$ has a smaller $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norm than $C_{1}$ because its roll-off is steeper, so it provides a larger robustness margin; it only incurs more phase lag well above $\\omega_{c}$, but not near $\\omega_{c}$.**\n- `$C_{2}$ has a smaller $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norm than $C_{1}$`: Incorrect. It is larger.\n- The reasoning \"because its roll-off is steeper\" is also flawed; steeper roll-off is often associated with time-domain ringing, which increases the $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norm.\n- `provides a larger robustness margin`: Incorrect.\n- `only incurs more phase lag well above $\\omega_{c}$`: Incorrect. It has significantly more phase lag at $\\omega_{c}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The first-order $C_{1}$ has a larger $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norm than $C_{2}$; at $\\omega=\\omega_{c}$ the Butterworth $C_{2}$ actually has less phase lag; thus the robustness margin is larger for $C_{2}$.**\n- `$C_{1}$ has a larger $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norm than $C_{2}$`: Incorrect. It is smaller.\n- `$C_{2}$ actually has less phase lag`: Incorrect. It has more phase lag.\n- `robustness margin is larger for $C_{2}$`: Incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2716610"}]}
