System: Single-input single-output (SISO), linear time-invariant (LTI).\n2.  Initial conditions: Zero-state, implying $y(t)=0$ for $t0$ and all internal states are zero at $t=0^-$.\n3.

Methodology: The derivation must use the convolution property in the Laplace domain, $Y(s)=G(s)X(s)$, and characterize the output in terms of singular and regular parts.\n\nValidation:\nThe problem is well-defined, scientifically sound, and internally consistent. It is a standard problem in the analysis of LTI systems using Laplace transforms, a core topic of control theory. The transfer function is a rational function, and the inputs are standard test signals. The requirement to distinguish between singular and regular parts of the output relates directly to the properties of the transfer function, specifically whether it is proper or strictly proper. The degree of the numerator polynomial is $1$, and the degree of the denominator polynomial is $2$. As the degree of the numerator is strictly less than the degree of the denominator, the transfer function $G(s)$ is strictly proper. This is a fundamental check in system analysis. All conditions are met for a unique, meaningful solution to exist. The problem is valid.\n\nSolution:\nThe output $Y(s)$ of a zero-state LTI system is given by the product of its transfer function $G(s)$ and the Laplace transform of the input $X(s)$, which is a statement of the convolution theorem:\n$$Y(s) = G(s)X(s)$$\nThe time-domain output is then $y(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{Y(s)\\}$. The structure of the output $y(t)$ as a tempered distribution depends on the properties of $G(s)$. A rational transfer function $G(s) = \\frac{N(s)}{D(s)}$ can be decomposed using polynomial long division into a polynomial part $P(s)$ and a strictly proper rational part $G_{sp}(s)$: $G(s) = P(s) + G_{sp}(s)$. The inverse Laplace transform of $P(s)$ yields a singular distribution at $t=0$, consisting of the Dirac delta $\\delta(t)$ and its derivatives. The inverse transform of $G_{sp}(s)$ yields a regular function for $t > 0$.\n\nThe given transfer function is $G(s)=\\dfrac{s+1}{s^{2}+3s+2}$. Let $N(s) = s+1$ and $D(s) = s^{2}+3s+2$. The degree of $N(s)$ is $m=1$ and the degree of $D(s)$ is $n=2$. Since $m  n$, the transfer function is strictly proper. This implies that the limit of $G(s)$ as $s \\to \\infty$ is $0$.\n$$\\lim_{s \\to \\infty} G(s) = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} \\frac{s+1}{s^{2}+3s+2} = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{1}{s}+\\frac{1}{s^2}}{1+\\frac{3}{s}+\\frac{2}{s^2}} = 0$$\nConsequently, the polynomial part $P(s)$ is zero. This proves that the impulse response, $g(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{G(s)\\}$, will contain no singular terms (no Dirac delta or its derivatives). Its singular part is zero.\n\nThe denominator can be factored as $s^{2}+3s+2 = (s+1)(s+2)$. The transfer function becomes:\n$$G(s) = \\frac{s+1}{(s+1)(s+2)}$$\nA pole-zero cancellation occurs at $s=-1$. For a zero-state response, the system's input-output behavior is governed by the reduced transfer function:\n$$G(s) = \\frac{1}{s+2}, \\quad s \\neq -1$$\nThis simplification is valid because the zero at $s=-1$ cancels the influence of the pole at $s=-1$ on the output for any input.\n\nCase (i): Input is the Dirac delta distribution, $x_{\\delta}(t) = \\delta(t)$.\nThe unilateral Laplace transform of the input is $X_{\\delta}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{\\delta(t)\\} = 1$.\nThe output in the Laplace domain is:\n$$Y_{\\delta}(s) = G(s)X_{\\delta}(s) = \\left(\\frac{1}{s+2}\\right) \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{s+2}$$\nThe time-domain output $y_{\\delta}(t)$ is the inverse Laplace transform of $Y_{\\delta}(s)$. This is the impulse response of the system.\n$$y_{\\delta}(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s+2}\\right\\}$$\nUsing the standard transform pair $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s-a}\\right\\} = \\exp(at)u(t)$, with $a = -2$, we obtain:\n$$y_{\\delta}(t) = \\exp(-2t)u(t)$$\nAs predicted, this output contains no singular part. The coefficient of any $\\delta^{(k)}(t)$ term is $0$. The output is a purely regular function for $t>0$, multiplied by the Heaviside step function $u(t)$ to enforce causality.\n\nCase (ii): Input is the Heaviside unit step, $x_{u}(t) = u(t)$.\nThe unilateral Laplace transform of the input is $X_{u}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\} = \\frac{1}{s}$.\nThe output in the Laplace domain is:\n$$Y_{u}(s) = G(s)X_{u}(s) = \\left(\\frac{1}{s+2}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{s} = \\frac{1}{s(s+2)}$$\nTo find the inverse Laplace transform, we use partial fraction expansion:\n$$Y_{u}(s) = \\frac{A}{s} + \\frac{B}{s+2}$$\nThe coefficients are found using the residue method:\n$$A = \\lim_{s \\to 0} s Y_{u}(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\frac{1}{s+2} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$B = \\lim_{s \\to -2} (s+2) Y_{u}(s) = \\lim_{s \\to -2} \\frac{1}{s} = -\\frac{1}{2}$$\nThus, the expanded form of the output is:\n$$Y_{u}(s) = \\frac{1/2}{s} - \\frac{1/2}{s+2}$$\nTaking the inverse Laplace transform of each term:\n$$y_{u}(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1/2}{s}\\right\\} - \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1/2}{s+2}\\right\\}$$\n$$y_{u}(t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s}\\right\\} - \\frac{1}{2}\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s+2}\\right\\}$$\nUsing the standard pairs for the step function and the exponential function, we find:\n$$y_{u}(t) = \\frac{1}{2}u(t) - \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-2t)u(t)$$\nThis can be written in a more compact form:\n$$y_{u}(t) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\exp(-2t))u(t)$$\nThe step response $y_{u}(t)$ is the time integral of the impulse response $y_{\\delta}(t)$. Since $y_{\\delta}(t)$ is a regular function (for $t \\ge 0$), its integral is a continuous function for $t \\ge 0$. Indeed, $y_u(0) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\exp(0)) = 0$. So, the step response also has no singular part.\n\nThe final expressions for the outputs, valid for $t \\ge 0$, are:\n$y_{\\delta}(t) = \\exp(-2t)u(t)$\n$y_{u}(t) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\exp(-2t))u(t)$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\exp(-2t)u(t)  \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\exp(-2t))u(t)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2717431"}, {"introduction": "After determining the complete time-domain response, a common engineering question is about the system's long-term behavior.

The problem is a standard exercise in the analysis of LTI systems using Laplace transforms. It is scientifically grounded in established control theory, mathematically consistent, well-posed, and objective. It contains all necessary information to proceed with a solution. The transfer function describes an unstable system, which is a valid scenario for analysis, particularly for examining the applicability of theorems like the FVT. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Applicability of the Final Value Theorem (FVT)\n\nThe Final Value Theorem states that if the limit $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y(t)$ exists and is finite, then it can be computed in the Laplace domain as $\\lim_{s \\to 0} sY(s)$. A necessary condition for the validity of this theorem is that the function $sY(s)$ must have all its poles in the open left-half of the complex plane. That is, for every pole $p$ of $sY(s)$, it must satisfy $\\text{Re}(p)  0$.\n\nThe output $Y(s)$ of the system is given by the product of the transfer function $G(s)$ and the input transform $U(s)$:\n$$Y(s) = G(s)U(s)$$\nThe input is a unit step function, $u(t)$, defined for $t \\ge 0$. Its unilateral Laplace transform is:\n$$U(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} 1 \\cdot \\exp(-st) dt = \\frac{1}{s}$$\nThe system's transfer function is given as:\n$$G(s) = \\frac{2}{(s+1)(s-1)}$$\nThe transform of the output is therefore:\n$$Y(s) = \\left( \\frac{2}{(s+1)(s-1)} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{s} \\right) = \\frac{2}{s(s+1)(s-1)}$$\nTo check the applicability of the FVT, we must examine the poles of the function $sY(s)$:\n$$sY(s) = s \\left( \\frac{2}{s(s+1)(s-1)} \\right) = \\frac{2}{(s+1)(s-1)}$$\nThe poles of $sY(s)$ are the roots of the denominator, which are $p_1 = -1$ and $p_2 = 1$.\nThe pole $p_1 = -1$ is in the open left-half plane, which is acceptable. However, the pole $p_2 = 1$ is in the right-half plane, since $\\text{Re}(p_2) = 1 > 0$. The presence of a pole in the right-half plane violates the necessary condition for the FVT.\nTherefore, the Final Value Theorem does not apply to $y(t)$ for this system and input. Applying it would yield a finite, but incorrect, value of $\\lim_{s \\to 0} sY(s) = \\frac{2}{(0+1)(0-1)} = -2$, which has no correspondence to the actual behavior of $y(t)$.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the actual limit $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y(t)$\n\nTo find the true limit, we must first determine the time-domain output $y(t)$ by computing the inverse Laplace transform of $Y(s)$. We use partial fraction expansion for $Y(s)$:\n$$Y(s) = \\frac{2}{s(s+1)(s-1)} = \\frac{A}{s} + \\frac{B}{s+1} + \\frac{C}{s-1}$$\nThe coefficients $A$, $B$, and $C$ are found using the residue method:\n$$A = \\lim_{s \\to 0} sY(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\frac{2}{(s+1)(s-1)} = \\frac{2}{(1)(-1)} = -2$$\n$$B = \\lim_{s \\to -1} (s+1)Y(s) = \\lim_{s \\to -1} \\frac{2}{s(s-1)} = \\frac{2}{(-1)(-1-1)} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1$$\n$$C = \\lim_{s \\to 1} (s-1)Y(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 1} \\frac{2}{s(s+1)} = \\frac{2}{(1)(1+1)} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1$$\nSubstituting these coefficients back into the expansion gives:\n$$Y(s) = -\\frac{2}{s} + \\frac{1}{s+1} + \\frac{1}{s-1}$$\nWe now take the inverse Laplace transform of each term to find $y(t)$. For a causal system with zero initial conditions, this is:\n$$y(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{Y(s)\\} = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{-\\frac{2}{s}\\right\\} + \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s+1}\\right\\} + \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s-1}\\right\\}$$\nUsing standard transform pairs, for $t \\ge 0$:\n$$y(t) = -2(1) + \\exp(-t) + \\exp(t)$$\n$$y(t) = \\exp(t) + \\exp(-t) - 2$$\nThis expression can also be written in terms of the hyperbolic cosine function as $y(t) = 2\\cosh(t) - 2$.\n\nNow we evaluate the limit of $y(t)$ as $t \\to \\infty$:\n$$\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y(t) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} (\\exp(t) + \\exp(-t) - 2)$$\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, the term $\\exp(t)$ grows without bound, i.e., $\\exp(t) \\to \\infty$. The term $\\exp(-t)$ approaches $0$. The constant term remains $-2$.\nThus, the limit is:\n$$\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y(t) = \\infty + 0 - 2 = \\infty$$\nThe output $y(t)$ diverges to infinity.

The problem is a standard exercise in state-space analysis and does not contain any logical contradictions, factual inaccuracies, or unscientific claims. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe transfer function $G(s)$ of a state-space system is defined by the relation $Y(s) = G(s)U(s)$, where $Y(s)$ and $U(s)$ are the Laplace transforms of the output $y(t)$ and input $u(t)$, respectively. We begin by taking the Laplace transform of the state and output equations, applying the zero initial condition $x(0) = 0$.\nThe state equation transforms to:\n$sX(s) - x(0) = AX(s) + BU(s) \\implies sX(s) = AX(s) + BU(s)$\nThe output equation transforms to:\n$Y(s) = CX(s) + DU(s)$\n\nFrom the transformed state equation, we solve for $X(s)$:\n$sX(s) - AX(s) = BU(s)$\n$(sI - A)X(s) = BU(s)$\n$X(s) = (sI - A)^{-1}BU(s)$\nwhere $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $X(s)$ into the transformed output equation gives:\n$Y(s) = C(sI - A)^{-1}BU(s) + DU(s)$\n$Y(s) = [C(sI - A)^{-1}B + D]U(s)$\nThus, the transfer function $G(s)$ is given by the formula:\n$$G(s) = C(sI - A)^{-1}B + D$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given matrices into this formula. The matrix $D$ is the zero scalar, $D=0$.\nFirst, we compute the term $(sI - A)$:\n$$sI - A = s\\begin{pmatrix}1  0\\\\ 0  1\\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix}0  1\\\\ -2  -3\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}s  -1\\\\ 2  s+3\\end{pmatrix}$$\nNext, we find the inverse of this matrix, $(sI - A)^{-1}$. The determinant of $(sI - A)$ is:\n$$\\det(sI - A) = s(s+3) - (-1)(2) = s^2 + 3s + 2$$\nThe inverse is then:\n$$(sI - A)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{s^2 + 3s + 2}\\begin{pmatrix}s+3  1\\\\ -2  s\\end{pmatrix}$$\nNow we pre-multiply by $C$ and post-multiply by $B$:\n$$G(s) = \\begin{pmatrix}2  1\\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\frac{1}{s^2 + 3s + 2}\\begin{pmatrix}s+3  1\\\\ -2  s\\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$G(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2 + 3s + 2} \\begin{pmatrix}2  1\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}s+3  1\\\\ -2  s\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}$$\nFirst, we compute the product $\\begin{pmatrix}2  1\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}s+3  1\\\\ -2  s\\end{pmatrix}$:\n$$\\begin{pmatrix}2  1\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}s+3  1\\\\ -2  s\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}2(s+3) + 1(-2)  2(1) + 1(s)\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}2s+6-2  2+s\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}2s+4  s+2\\end{pmatrix}$$\nNow, we complete the final multiplication:\n$$G(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2 + 3s + 2} \\begin{pmatrix}2s+4  s+2\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{(2s+4)(0) + (s+2)(1)}{s^2 + 3s + 2}$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$G(s) = \\frac{s+2}{s^2 + 3s + 2}$$\nThis result verifies the expression given in the problem statement.\n\nNext, we analyze the pole-zero cancellation. We factor the denominator of $G(s)$:\n$$s^2 + 3s + 2 = (s+1)(s+2)$$\nSo, the transfer function is:\n$$G(s) = \\frac{s+2}{(s+1)(s+2)}$$\nA common factor of $(s+2)$ appears in the numerator and the denominator. This corresponds to a zero at $s = -2$ and a pole at $s = -2$. This is a pole-zero cancellation. After cancellation, the reduced transfer function is $G_{red}(s) = \\frac{1}{s+1}$. This cancellation implies that the original $2^{nd}$-order state-space realization is not minimal. A non-minimal realization is either not controllable, not observable, or neither.\n\nWe check for controllability using the controllability matrix $\\mathcal{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} B  AB \\end{pmatrix}$. The system is controllable if $\\mathcal{C}$ has full rank, which is $2$ for this system.\n$B = \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}$\n$AB = \\begin{pmatrix}0  1\\\\ -2  -3\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\ -3\\end{pmatrix}$\nThe controllability matrix is:\n$$\\mathcal{C} = \\begin{pmatrix}0  1\\\\ 1  -3\\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe determinant of $\\mathcal{C}$ is $\\det(\\mathcal{C}) = (0)(-3) - (1)(1) = -1$. Since $\\det(\\mathcal{C}) \\neq 0$, the matrix has rank $2$. The realization is controllable.\n\nWe check for observability using the observability matrix $\\mathcal{O} = \\begin{pmatrix} C \\\\ CA \\end{pmatrix}$. The system is observable if $\\mathcal{O}$ has full rank, which is $2$.\n$C = \\begin{pmatrix}2  1\\end{pmatrix}$\n$CA = \\begin{pmatrix}2  1\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}0  1\\\\ -2  -3\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}2(0)+1(-2)  2(1)+1(-3)\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}-2  -1\\end{pmatrix}$\nThe observability matrix is:\n$$\\mathcal{O} = \\begin{pmatrix}2  1\\\\ -2  -1\\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe determinant of $\\mathcal{O}$ is $\\det(\\mathcal{O}) = (2)(-1) - (1)(-2) = -2 + 2 = 0$. Since $\\det(\\mathcal{O}) = 0$, the matrix does not have full rank; its rank is $1$. The realization is not observable.\n\nThe pole-zero cancellation at $s = -2$ is a direct consequence of the lack of observability. The unobservable mode of the system corresponds to the pole that is cancelled. The poles of the system are the eigenvalues of $A$, which are the roots of $\\det(sI-A)=s^2+3s+2=0$, so the eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. The unobservable subspace is the null space of $\\mathcal{O}$, spanned by the vector $v$ such that $\\mathcal{O}v = 0$. For $v=\\begin{pmatrix}v_1 \\\\ v_2\\end{pmatrix}$, we have $2v_1+v_2 = 0$. An eigenvector of $A$ associated with $\\lambda_2=-2$ is $v = \\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ -2\\end{pmatrix}$. This vector satisfies $2(1)+(-2)=0$, so it lies in the null space of $\\mathcal{O}$. This confirms the unobservable mode is associated with the eigenvalue $-2$.\n\nFinally, we determine the McMillan degree of the system. The McMillan degree is the order of a minimal state-space realization of the transfer function $G(s)$. This order is equal to the degree of the denominator of the transfer function after all pole-zero cancellations have been performed.\nAs shown, $G(s) = \\frac{s+2}{(s+1)(s+2)}$ reduces to $G_{red}(s) = \\frac{1}{s+1}$.\nThe denominator of the reduced transfer function is $s+1$, which is a polynomial of degree $1$.\nTherefore, the McMillan degree of the system is $1$.\nAny minimal realization must have an order of $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2717394"}]}
