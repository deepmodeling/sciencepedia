It is a standard problem in the analysis of LTI systems.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. We proceed to a full solution.\n\n**Derivation and Analysis**\n\nFirst, we determine the system's transfer function, $H(z)$, by applying the Z-transform to the difference equation. Using the time-shifting property $\\mathcal{Z}\\{f[n-k]\\} = z^{-k} F(z)$ and assuming zero initial conditions, we obtain:\n$$Y(z) - 2\\cos(\\omega_0)z^{-1}Y(z) + z^{-2}Y(z) = X(z)$$\n$$Y(z)(1 - 2\\cos(\\omega_0)z^{-1} + z^{-2}) = X(z)$$\nThe transfer function $H(z) = Y(z)/X(z)$ is therefore:\n$$H(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - 2\\cos(\\omega_0)z^{-1} + z^{-2}} = \\frac{z^2}{z^2 - 2\\cos(\\omega_0)z + 1}$$\n\nNext, we find the poles of $H(z)$ by finding the roots of the denominator polynomial $z^2 - 2\\cos(\\omega_0)z + 1 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula:\n$$z = \\frac{2\\cos(\\omega_0) \\pm \\sqrt{(2\\cos(\\omega_0))^2 - 4}}{2} = \\cos(\\omega_0) \\pm \\sqrt{\\cos^2(\\omega_0) - 1}$$\nUsing the identity $\\cos^2(\\omega_0) - 1 = -\\sin^2(\\omega_0)$, we get:\n$$z = \\cos(\\omega_0) \\pm \\sqrt{- \\sin^2(\\omega_0)} = \\cos(\\omega_0) \\pm j\\sin(\\omega_0)$$\nBy Euler's formula, the poles are $p_1 = e^{j\\omega_0}$ and $p_2 = e^{-j\\omega_0}$.\nSince $0  \\omega_0  \\pi$, we know that $\\sin(\\omega_0) \\neq 0$, which ensures the poles are distinct and complex. The magnitude of both poles is $\\lvert e^{\\pm j\\omega_0} \\rvert = 1$. Thus, the poles lie on the unit circle.\n\nThe problem states the system is causal. For a causal system, the Region of Convergence (ROC) is the region in the z-plane outside the outermost pole. Here, the poles are on the unit circle, so the ROC is $\\lvert z \\rvert  1$.\n\nBIBO stability requires that the ROC of $H(z)$ includes the unit circle $\\lvert z \\rvert = 1$. Since the ROC is $\\lvert z \\rvert  1$, it does not include the unit circle. Therefore, the system is not BIBO stable. This implies that the impulse response $h[n]$ is not absolutely summable, i.e., $\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\lvert h[n] \\rvert = \\infty$.\n\nTo analyze the properties of the impulse response $h[n]$, we find its expression by inverse Z-transforming $H(z)$. Using partial fraction expansion:\n$$H(z) = \\frac{1}{(1 - e^{j\\omega_0}z^{-1})(1 - e^{-j\\omega_0}z^{-1})} = \\frac{A}{1 - e^{j\\omega_0}z^{-1}} + \\frac{B}{1 - e^{-j\\omega_0}z^{-1}}$$\nThe coefficients are:\n$$A = \\frac{1}{1-e^{-j2\\omega_0}} = \\frac{1}{e^{-j\\omega_0}(e^{j\\omega_0}-e^{-j\\omega_0})} = \\frac{e^{j\\omega_0}}{2j\\sin(\\omega_0)}$$\n$$B = \\frac{1}{1-e^{j2\\omega_0}} = \\frac{1}{e^{j\\omega_0}(e^{-j\\omega_0}-e^{j\\omega_0})} = \\frac{-e^{-j\\omega_0}}{2j\\sin(\\omega_0)}$$\nThus,\n$$H(z) = \\frac{1}{2j\\sin(\\omega_0)} \\left( \\frac{e^{j\\omega_0}}{1-e^{j\\omega_0}z^{-1}} - \\frac{e^{-j\\omega_0}}{1-e^{-j\\omega_0}z^{-1}} \\right)$$\nFor a causal system, the inverse Z-transform of $\\frac{1}{1-pz^{-1}}$ is $p^n u[n]$. Applying this, we get the impulse response:\n$$h[n] = \\frac{1}{2j\\sin(\\omega_0)} \\left( e^{j\\omega_0}(e^{j\\omega_0})^n - e^{-j\\omega_0}(e^{-j\\omega_0})^n \\right) u[n]$$\n$$h[n] = \\frac{1}{2j\\sin(\\omega_0)} \\left( e^{j(n+1)\\omega_0} - e^{-j(n+1)\\omega_0} \\right) u[n]$$\nUsing the identity $\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{e^{j\\theta} - e^{-j\\theta}}{2j}$, this simplifies to:\n$$h[n] = \\frac{\\sin((n+1)\\omega_0)}{\\sin(\\omega_0)} u[n]$$\nFor $n \\ge 0$, the magnitude of the impulse response is $\\lvert h[n] \\rvert = \\frac{\\lvert \\sin((n+1)\\omega_0) \\rvert}{\\lvert \\sin(\\omega_0) \\rvert}$.\nSince $\\lvert \\sin(\\theta) \\rvert \\le 1$ and $0  \\omega_0  \\pi$ implies $\\sin(\\omega_0) \\ne 0$, we have $\\lvert h[n] \\rvert \\le \\frac{1}{\\lvert \\sin(\\omega_0) \\rvert}$. This means the impulse response $h[n]$ is bounded for all $n$.\nHowever, the terms $\\lvert h[n] \\rvert$ do not approach $0$ as $n \\to \\infty$. By the term test for divergence, the series $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\lvert h[n] \\rvert$ must diverge. The system is therefore not BIBO stable.

This statement propagates a common misunderstanding. Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. For the causal system, the ROC of $H(z)$ includes the unit circle $|z|=1$, so the DTFT $\\mathcal{F}\\{h[n]\\}$ exists and coincides with the steady-state frequency response.**\nThe ROC for this causal system with poles on the unit circle is $\\lvert z \\rvert  1$. This region does not include the unit circle. The DTFT, defined as the Z-transform evaluated on the unit circle, does not exist as a convergent function in the usual sense because the impulse response is not absolutely summable. The statement is factually wrong on its primary claim. Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The series $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\lvert h[n]\\rvert$ diverges because $\\lvert h[n]\\rvert$ does not approach $0$ as $n\\to\\infty$.**\nThe system is not BIBO stable, which means by definition that the series $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\lvert h[n]\\rvert$ diverges. The reason given is that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\lvert h[n] \\rvert \\neq 0$. As we established, $\\lvert h[n] \\rvert = \\frac{\\lvert \\sin((n+1)\\omega_0) \\rvert}{\\lvert \\sin(\\omega_0) \\rvert}$, and this sequence does not converge to $0$. The term test for divergence states that if the terms of a series do not tend to zero, the series diverges. This is a valid and correct justification for the divergence. Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. If the two poles at $z=e^{\\pm j\\omega_0}$ were replaced by a repeated (double) pole at $z=e^{j\\omega_0}$, the impulse response would remain bounded and still be not absolutely summable.**\nA system with a double pole at $p_0=e^{j\\omega_0}$ could have a transfer function like $H_{new}(z) = \\frac{1}{(1-e^{j\\omega_0}z^{-1})^2}$. The inverse Z-transform for a causal system is found from the pair $(n+1)p_0^n u[n] \\leftrightarrow \\frac{1}{(1-p_0z^{-1})^2}$ for $\\lvert z \\rvert  \\lvert p_0 \\rvert$.\nThe impulse response would be $h_{new}[n] = (n+1)(e^{j\\omega_0})^n u[n]$.\nThe magnitude is $\\lvert h_{new}[n] \\rvert = (n+1) \\lvert e^{j\\omega_0} \\rvert^n = (n+1) \\cdot 1^n = n+1$ for $n \\ge 0$.\nThe impulse response magnitude grows linearly with $n$ and is therefore **unbounded**.

The term \"causal\" unambiguously defines the region of convergence (ROC) for the systems.\n- The problem is **objective**, stated in precise mathematical language.\n- The setup is **complete and consistent**.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is found to be valid. A rigorous derivation of the solution will now proceed.\n\nThe analysis is based on fundamental principles. The Z-transform of the input unit step function $u[k]$ is given by\n$$U(z) = \\mathcal{Z}\\{u[k]\\} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (1)z^{-k} = \\frac{1}{1-z^{-1}} = \\frac{z}{z-1}, \\quad |z|1$$\nThe Z-transform of the output $Y(z)$ of an LTI system with transfer function $H(z)$ is the product of the transfer function and the input's Z-transform, $Y(z) = H(z)U(z)$. The final value theorem for the Z-transform states that if the sequence $y[k]$ converges to a finite limit, then $\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} y[k] = \\lim_{z\\to 1} (z-1)Y(z)$. A sufficient condition for the applicability of this theorem is that all poles of the function $(z-1)Y(z)$ must lie strictly inside the unit circle, i.e., have magnitude less than $1$. The \"naive shortcut\" mentioned in the problem consists of computing the limit $\\lim_{z\\to 1} (z-1)Y(z)$ irrespective of this condition.\n\n**Analysis of System $\\mathcal{S}_1$**\n\nThe transfer function is $H_1(z) = \\dfrac{z}{z-1.1}$.\nThe Z-transform of the output is\n$$Y_1(z) = H_1(z)U(z) = \\left( \\frac{z}{z-1.1} \\right) \\left( \\frac{z}{z-1} \\right) = \\frac{z^2}{(z-1.1)(z-1)}$$\nThe naive \"final value\" is computed as:\n$$y_{1,ss}^{\\text{naive}} = \\lim_{z\\to 1} (z-1)Y_1(z) = \\lim_{z\\to 1} (z-1)\\frac{z^2}{(z-1.1)(z-1)} = \\lim_{z\\to 1} \\frac{z^2}{z-1.1} = \\frac{1^2}{1-1.1} = \\frac{1}{-0.1} = -10$$\nThis computation yields a finite number, $-10$.\n\nNow, we check the condition for the final value theorem. The function to be examined is $(z-1)Y_1(z) = \\dfrac{z^2}{z-1.1}$. The poles of this function are the roots of the denominator, which is $z-1.1=0$, giving a pole at $z=1.1$. The magnitude of this pole is $|1.1|  1$, which is outside the unit circle. The theorem is not applicable.\n\nTo find the actual behavior of the output $y_1[k]$, we must compute the inverse Z-transform of $Y_1(z)$. We perform a partial fraction expansion of $Y_1(z)/z$:\n$$\\frac{Y_1(z)}{z} = \\frac{z}{(z-1.1)(z-1)} = \\frac{A}{z-1.1} + \\frac{B}{z-1}$$\nThe coefficients are:\n$$A = \\left. \\frac{z}{z-1} \\right|_{z=1.1} = \\frac{1.1}{1.1-1} = \\frac{1.1}{0.1} = 11$$\n$$B = \\left. \\frac{z}{z-1.1} \\right|_{z=1} = \\frac{1}{1-1.1} = \\frac{1}{-0.1} = -10$$\nThus,\n$$Y_1(z) = 11 \\left( \\frac{z}{z-1.1} \\right) - 10 \\left( \\frac{z}{z-1} \\right)$$\nUsing the Z-transform pair $\\mathcal{Z}\\{a^k u[k]\\} = \\frac{z}{z-a}$ for $|z||a|$, the inverse transform is:\n$$y_1[k] = \\left( 11(1.1)^k - 10(1)^k \\right) u[k] = (11(1.1)^k - 10)u[k]$$\nAs $k \\to \\infty$, the term $(1.1)^k$ grows without bound since its base $1.1$ is greater than $1$. Therefore, $\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} y_1[k] = \\infty$. The output diverges with exponential growth.\n\nConclusion for $\\mathcal{S}_1$: The naive calculation yields a finite value of $-10$, but the actual output diverges. This is a counterexample to the naive shortcut. The failure is correctly attributed to the pole of $(z-1)Y_1(z)$ at $z=1.1$, located outside the unit circle.\n\n**Analysis of System $\\mathcal{S}_2$**\n\nThe transfer function is $H_2(z) = \\dfrac{z}{z+1}$.\nThe Z-transform of the output is\n$$Y_2(z) = H_2(z)U(z) = \\left( \\frac{z}{z+1} \\right) \\left( \\frac{z}{z-1} \\right) = \\frac{z^2}{(z+1)(z-1)}$$\nThe naive \"final value\" is computed as:\n$$y_{2,ss}^{\\text{naive}} = \\lim_{z\\to 1} (z-1)Y_2(z) = \\lim_{z\\to 1} (z-1)\\frac{z^2}{(z+1)(z-1)} = \\lim_{z\\to 1} \\frac{z^2}{z+1} = \\frac{1^2}{1+1} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThis computation yields a finite number, $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nWe check the condition for the final value theorem. The function is $(z-1)Y_2(z) = \\dfrac{z^2}{z+1}$. The poles are roots of $z+1=0$, giving a pole at $z=-1$. The magnitude is $|-1|=1$. A pole on the unit circle (other than a single pole at $z=1$ in $Y(z)$ which is cancelled) violates the strict requirement that poles be *inside* the unit circle. The theorem is not applicable.\n\nTo find the actual behavior of $y_2[k]$, we perform a partial fraction expansion of $Y_2(z)/z$:\n$$\\frac{Y_2(z)}{z} = \\frac{z}{(z+1)(z-1)} = \\frac{A}{z+1} + \\frac{B}{z-1}$$\nThe coefficients are:\n$$A = \\left. \\frac{z}{z-1} \\right|_{z=-1} = \\frac{-1}{-1-1} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$B = \\left. \\frac{z}{z+1} \\right|_{z=1} = \\frac{1}{1+1} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThus,\n$$Y_2(z) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{z}{z+1} \\right) + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{z}{z-1} \\right)$$\nThe inverse Z-transform is:\n$$y_2[k] = \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(-1)^k + \\frac{1}{2}(1)^k \\right) u[k] = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + (-1)^k)u[k]$$\nThe sequence $y_2[k]$ for $k \\ge 0$ is $1, 0, 1, 0, 1, \\dots$. This sequence oscillates between $0$ and $1$ and does not converge to a single value. Therefore, $\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} y_2[k]$ does not exist.\n\nConclusion for $\\mathcal{S}_2$: The naive calculation yields a finite value of $\\frac{1}{2}$, but the actual output does not converge. This is also a counterexample to the naive shortcut. The failure is correctly attributed to the pole of $(z-1)Y_2(z)$ at $z=-1$, located on the unit circle.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nA. **Correct**. This option correctly states that both systems are counterexamples. It provides the correct naive final values: $-10$ for $\\mathcal{S}_1$ and $\\frac{1}{2}$ for $\\mathcal{S}_2$. It accurately describes the true behavior of the outputs: $y_1[k]$ diverges exponentially and $y_2[k]$ exhibits persistent oscillation (does not converge). Crucially, it provides the correct justification by identifying the poles of the relevant expressions, $(z-1)Y_1(z)$ at $z=1.1$ (outside the unit circle) and $(z-1)Y_2(z)$ at $z=-1$ (on the unit circle), as the reason for the failure of the final value theorem.\n\nB. **Incorrect**. This option is incorrect on multiple accounts. It claims $y_1[k]$ converges, when it diverges. It also claims the naive and actual final values for $\\mathcal{S}_2$ agree, when in fact $y_2[k]$ does not converge at all.\n\nC. **Incorrect**. This option incorrectly claims that the naive value for $\\mathcal{S}_1$ agrees with its limit, which is false as the output diverges. It also mischaracterizes the behavior of $y_2[k]$ as diverging in magnitude, when it is bounded and oscillating.\n\nD. **Incorrect**. This option incorrectly claims that neither system is a counterexample. This is patently false based on the derivations above. The reasoning provided is precisely the fallacy the problem is designed to expose: the validity of the final value theorem is not guaranteed by the existence of an algebraic limit but depends on the pole locations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2757911"}]}
