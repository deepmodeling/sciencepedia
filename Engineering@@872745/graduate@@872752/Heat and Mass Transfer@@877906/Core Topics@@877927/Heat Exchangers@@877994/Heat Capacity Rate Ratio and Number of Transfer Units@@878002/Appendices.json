We shall proceed with the analysis using the effectiveness-Number of Transfer Units ($\\varepsilon$-NTU) method.\n\nThe problem specifies a parallel-flow heat exchanger. The given parameters are:\nHot fluid inlet temperature, $T_{h,i} = 410 \\,\\mathrm{K}$.\nCold fluid inlet temperature, $T_{c,i} = 300 \\,\\mathrm{K}$.\nThe heat capacity rate ratio, $C_{r} = C_{\\min}/C_{\\max} = 0.50$.\nThe Number of Transfer Units, $\\mathrm{NTU} = 1.20$.\n\nThe problem states that the hot stream has the larger heat capacity rate. Let $C_h$ and $C_c$ be the heat capacity rates of the hot and cold streams, respectively. This means $C_h > C_c$. By definition, $C_{\\max}$ is the larger of the two heat capacity rates and $C_{\\min}$ is the smaller. Therefore, we have $C_{\\max} = C_h$ and $C_{\\min} = C_c$. The heat capacity rate ratio is $C_r = C_c/C_h = 0.50$.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the effectiveness of the heat exchanger, $\\varepsilon$. For a parallel-flow configuration, the effectiveness is given by the relation:\n$$ \\varepsilon = \\frac{1 - \\exp[-\\mathrm{NTU}(1 + C_r)]}{1 + C_r} $$\nSubstituting the given values $\\mathrm{NTU} = 1.20$ and $C_r = 0.50$:\n$$ \\varepsilon = \\frac{1 - \\exp[-1.20(1 + 0.50)]}{1 + 0.50} = \\frac{1 - \\exp[-1.20(1.5)]}{1.5} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-1.8)}{1.5} $$\nThe value of the exponential term is $\\exp(-1.8) \\approx 0.165299$.\n$$ \\varepsilon \\approx \\frac{1 - 0.165299}{1.5} = \\frac{0.834701}{1.5} \\approx 0.556467 $$\n\nNext, we use the definition of effectiveness to find the actual rate of heat transfer, $q$. The effectiveness is the ratio of the actual heat transfer rate to the maximum possible heat transfer rate, $q_{\\max}$:\n$$ \\varepsilon = \\frac{q}{q_{\\max}} $$\nwhere $q_{\\max}$ is defined as:\n$$ q_{\\max} = C_{\\min}(T_{h,i} - T_{c,i}) $$\nThus, the actual heat transfer rate is:\n$$ q = \\varepsilon C_{\\min}(T_{h,i} - T_{c,i}) $$\n\nThe heat transfer rate $q$ can also be expressed through energy balances on each fluid stream.\nFor the cold stream:\n$$ q = C_c(T_{c,o} - T_{c,i}) $$\nSince we identified $C_c = C_{\\min}$, we can write:\n$$ q = C_{\\min}(T_{c,o} - T_{c,i}) $$\nEquating the two expressions for $q$:\n$$ C_{\\min}(T_{c,o} - T_{c,i}) = \\varepsilon C_{\\min}(T_{h,i} - T_{c,i}) $$\nThe term $C_{\\min}$ cancels, and we can solve for the cold stream outlet temperature, $T_{c,o}$:\n$$ T_{c,o} = T_{c,i} + \\varepsilon (T_{h,i} - T_{c,i}) $$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$ T_{c,o} = 300 + (0.556467)(410 - 300) = 300 + (0.556467)(110) \\approx 300 + 61.2114 = 361.2114 \\,\\mathrm{K} $$\n\nFor the hot stream, the energy balance is:\n$$ q = C_h(T_{h,i} - T_{h,o}) $$\nAgain, equating this with the expression for $q$ from the effectiveness definition:\n$$ C_h(T_{h,i} - T_{h,o}) = \\varepsilon C_{\\min}(T_{h,i} - T_{c,i}) $$\nSolving for the hot stream outlet temperature, $T_{h,o}$:\n$$ T_{h,o} = T_{h,i} - \\varepsilon \\frac{C_{\\min}}{C_h}(T_{h,i} - T_{c,i}) $$\nRecognizing that $C_{\\min}/C_h = C_r$:\n$$ T_{h,o} = T_{h,i} - \\varepsilon C_r(T_{h,i} - T_{c,i}) $$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$ T_{h,o} = 410 - (0.556467)(0.50)(410 - 300) = 410 - (0.556467)(0.50)(110) \\approx 410 - 30.6057 = 379.3943 \\,\\mathrm{K} $$\nRounding the outlet temperatures to four significant figures as required:\n$T_{c,o} \\approx 361.2 \\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$T_{h,o} \\approx 379.4 \\,\\mathrm{K}$\n\nFinally, we must identify the pinch location. This is the axial end where the temperature difference between the hot and cold streams is at its minimum. Let's calculate the temperature differences at the inlet and outlet.\nThe temperature difference at the inlet is:\n$$ \\Delta T_i = T_{h,i} - T_{c,i} = 410 - 300 = 110 \\,\\mathrm{K} $$\nThe temperature difference at the outlet is:\n$$ \\Delta T_o = T_{h,o} - T_{c,o} \\approx 379.3943 - 361.2114 = 18.1829 \\,\\mathrm{K} $$\nComparing the two values, $\\Delta T_o < \\Delta T_i$. The minimum temperature difference occurs at the outlet. This is a fundamental characteristic of parallel-flow heat exchangers; as both fluids flow in the same direction, their temperatures asymptotically approach each other, leading to a continuously decreasing temperature difference along the flow path. The minimum must therefore be at the outlet.\nThe problem defines a binary indicator $p$ such that $p=1$ if the pinch is at the outlet and $p=0$ if it is at the inlet. Since the pinch is at the outlet, $p=1$.\n\nThe final results are $T_{h,o} \\approx 379.4 \\,\\mathrm{K}$, $T_{c,o} \\approx 361.2 \\,\\mathrm{K}$, and $p=1$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 379.4 & 361.2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "2492801"}, {"introduction": "While predicting performance is crucial, engineers often face the inverse task: characterizing an existing heat exchanger from operational data.

The final output must be a single line containing a Python-style list of these three quadruples, e.g., $[[\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot],[\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot],[\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot]]$.\n\n- Case $1$ (general “happy path”):\n  - Hot side: species $\\mathrm{N_2}$, $\\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{h}} = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{kg/s}$, $T_{\\mathrm{h,in}} = 700\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $p_{\\mathrm{h}} = 200\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$, $A_{\\mathrm{flow,h}} = 0.025\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$, $D_{\\mathrm{h,h}} = 0.020\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n  - Cold side: species $\\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{c}} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{kg/s}$, $T_{\\mathrm{c,in}} = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $p_{\\mathrm{c}} = 200\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$, $A_{\\mathrm{flow,c}} = 0.020\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$, $D_{\\mathrm{h,c}} = 0.015\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n  - Wall and area: $A = 60.0\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$, $\\delta = 0.002\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $k_{\\mathrm{w}} = 16.0\\,\\mathrm{W/(m\\cdot K)}$.\n\n- Case $2$ (capacity rate ratio $C_r$ near unity and smaller area):\n  - Hot side: species $\\mathrm{N_2}$, $\\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{h}} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{kg/s}$, $T_{\\mathrm{h,in}} = 800\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $p_{\\mathrm{h}} = 300\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$, $A_{\\mathrm{flow,h}} = 0.015\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$, $D_{\\mathrm{h,h}} = 0.018\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n  - Cold side: species $\\mathrm{N_2}$, $\\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{c}} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{kg/s}$, $T_{\\mathrm{c,in}} = 600\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $p_{\\mathrm{c}} = 300\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$, $A_{\\mathrm{flow,c}} = 0.018\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$, $D_{\\mathrm{h,c}} = 0.018\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n  - Wall and area: $A = 25.0\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$, $\\delta = 0.0015\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $k_{\\mathrm{w}} = 20.0\\,\\mathrm{W/(m\\cdot K)}$.\n\n- Case $3$ (small $C_r$ edge case with large cold-side capacity):\n  - Hot side: species $\\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{h}} = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{kg/s}$, $T_{\\mathrm{h,in}} = 600\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $p_{\\mathrm{h}} = 250\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$, $A_{\\mathrm{flow,h}} = 0.004\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$, $D_{\\mathrm{h,h}} = 0.010\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n  - Cold side: species $\\mathrm{N_2}$, $\\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{c}} = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{kg/s}$, $T_{\\mathrm{c,in}} = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $p_{\\mathrm{c}} = 300\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$, $A_{\\mathrm{flow,c}} = 0.050\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$, $D_{\\mathrm{h,c}} = 0.030\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n  - Wall and area: $A = 12.0\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$, $\\delta = 0.0010\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $k_{\\mathrm{w}} = 15.0\\,\\mathrm{W/(m\\cdot K)}$.\n\nAngle units are not applicable. All temperatures must be expressed in $\\mathrm{K}$. The effectiveness $\\varepsilon$ and the number of transfer units $\\mathrm{NTU}$ are dimensionless. Your program must produce a single line of output containing the three case results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each case result is the four-element list $[T_{\\mathrm{h,out}}, T_{\\mathrm{c,out}}, \\varepsilon, \\mathrm{NTU}]$ with each float rounded to six digits after the decimal point, e.g., $[[700.000000,300.000000,0.000000,0.000000],[\\dots],[\\dots]]$.", "solution": "The problem as stated is a scientifically grounded and well-posed problem in computational heat transfer. It describes the analysis of a counterflow gas-to-gas heat exchanger where the thermophysical properties of the fluids are strongly dependent on temperature. This coupling between the fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and thermodynamics necessitates a numerical, iterative solution. The problem provides a complete set of physical models, geometric data, and operational parameters, along with a specified iterative algorithm to find the steady-state performance. The supplied information is self-contained, consistent, and free of scientific or logical flaws. Therefore, a valid solution can be constructed.\n\nThe method employed is a fixed-point iteration scheme acting on the outlet temperatures of the hot and cold fluid streams, $T_{\\mathrm{h,out}}$ and $T_{\\mathrm{c,out}}$. The core principle is to repeatedly solve the system of equations until the outlet temperatures converge to a stable solution. An under-relaxation factor, $\\theta$, is used to dampen oscillations and improve the stability of the iterative process.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure for each test case is as follows:\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    The iteration starts with an initial guess for the outlet temperatures. A robust choice is to set the initial outlet temperatures equal to their respective inlet temperatures: $T_{\\mathrm{h,out}}^{(k=0)} = T_{\\mathrm{h,in}}$ and $T_{\\mathrm{c,out}}^{(k=0)} = T_{\\mathrm{c,in}}$, where $k$ is the iteration index. The iteration counter is set to $k=0$.\n\n2.  **Iterative Loop**:\n    The loop continues until convergence is achieved or a maximum number of iterations, specified as $200$, is reached. Convergence is defined as the maximum absolute change in either outlet temperature between successive iterations falling below a tolerance of $10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{K}$. Within each iteration $k$:\n\n    a.  **Property Evaluation**: The mean bulk temperature for each stream is calculated using the temperatures from the previous iteration, $T_{\\mathrm{out}}^{(k-1)}$:\n        $$ T_{\\mathrm{h,mean}} = \\frac{1}{2}(T_{\\mathrm{h,in}} + T_{\\mathrm{h,out}}^{(k-1)}) $$\n        $$ T_{\\mathrm{c,mean}} = \\frac{1}{2}(T_{\\mathrm{c,in}} + T_{\\mathrm{c,out}}^{(k-1)}) $$\n        All temperature-dependent properties—density ($\\rho$), dynamic viscosity ($\\mu$), specific heat capacity ($c_p$), and Prandtl number ($\\mathrm{Pr}$)—are evaluated at these mean temperatures using the provided physical models: Ideal Gas Law for $\\rho$, Sutherland's Law for $\\mu$, Shomate polynomials for $c_p$ (converted to a mass basis from the given molar basis), and an empirical function for $\\mathrm{Pr}$. The thermal conductivity $k$ is then derived from the Eucken relation: $k = \\mu c_p / \\mathrm{Pr}$.\n\n    b.  **Convective Heat Transfer Coefficients**: For each side of the exchanger, the Reynolds number ($\\mathrm{Re}$) is calculated to determine the flow regime:\n        $$ \\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{\\rho V D_{\\mathrm{h}}}{\\mu} = \\frac{\\dot{m} D_{\\mathrm{h}}}{A_{\\mathrm{flow}} \\mu} $$\n        The Nusselt number ($\\mathrm{Nu}$) is then determined based on the flow regime:\n        - For laminar flow ($\\mathrm{Re} < 2300$), a constant value is used: $\\mathrm{Nu} = 3.66$.\n        - For turbulent flow ($\\mathrm{Re} > 3000$), the Gnielinski correlation is used, which depends on the friction factor $f$ from the Petukhov correlation:\n          $$ f = \\left(0.790\\ln \\mathrm{Re} - 1.64\\right)^{-2} $$\n          $$ \\mathrm{Nu} = \\frac{(f/8)(\\mathrm{Re}-1000)\\mathrm{Pr}}{1 + 12.7(f/8)^{1/2}(\\mathrm{Pr}^{2/3}-1)} $$\n        - For transitional flow ($2300 \\le \\mathrm{Re} \\le 3000$), $\\mathrm{Nu}$ is found by linear interpolation with respect to $\\mathrm{Re}$ between the laminar value at $\\mathrm{Re}=2300$ and the turbulent value calculated from the Gnielinski correlation at $\\mathrm{Re}=3000$.\n        Finally, the convective heat transfer coefficient $h$ is computed:\n        $$ h = \\frac{\\mathrm{Nu} \\cdot k}{D_{\\mathrm{h}}} $$\n\n    c.  **Overall Heat Transfer Coefficient ($U$)**: The overall coefficient is calculated based on a series thermal resistance model for a flat wall, accounting for convection on both sides and conduction through the wall:\n        $$ \\frac{1}{U} = \\frac{1}{h_{\\mathrm{h}}} + \\frac{\\delta}{k_{\\mathrm{w}}} + \\frac{1}{h_{\\mathrm{c}}} $$\n\n    d.  **Effectiveness-NTU Calculation**: The heat capacity rates for the hot and cold streams are $C_{\\mathrm{h}} = \\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{h}} c_{p,\\mathrm{h}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{c}} c_{p,\\mathrm{c}}$. From these, $C_{\\min}$ and $C_{\\max}$ are identified, and the capacity rate ratio is found: $C_r = C_{\\min}/C_{\\max}$. The number of transfer units ($\\mathrm{NTU}$) is then calculated:\n        $$ \\mathrm{NTU} = \\frac{U A}{C_{\\min}} $$\n        The heat exchanger effectiveness $\\varepsilon$ for a counterflow configuration is computed. For the case where $C_r \\neq 1$:\n        $$ \\varepsilon = \\frac{1 - \\exp[-\\mathrm{NTU}(1 - C_r)]}{1 - C_r \\exp[-\\mathrm{NTU}(1 - C_r)]} $$\n        For the balanced case where $C_r = 1$:\n        $$ \\varepsilon = \\frac{\\mathrm{NTU}}{1 + \\mathrm{NTU}} $$\n\n    e.  **Outlet Temperature Update**: The rate of heat transfer $q$ is calculated from the effectiveness:\n        $$ q = \\varepsilon C_{\\min} (T_{\\mathrm{h,in}} - T_{\\mathrm{c,in}}) $$\n        New candidate outlet temperatures, $T_{\\mathrm{out}}^{\\mathrm{new}}$, are determined from the energy balance on each stream:\n        $$ T_{\\mathrm{h,out}}^{\\mathrm{new}} = T_{\\mathrm{h,in}} - \\frac{q}{C_{\\mathrm{h}}} $$\n        $$ T_{\\mathrm{c,out}}^{\\mathrm{new}} = T_{\\mathrm{c,in}} + \\frac{q}{C_{\\mathrm{c}}} $$\n\n    f.  **Relaxation**: To ensure stable convergence, the newly computed temperatures are combined with the values from the previous iteration using the specified relaxation factor $\\theta = 0.6$:\n        $$ T_{\\mathrm{h,out}}^{(k)} = \\theta T_{\\mathrm{h,out}}^{\\mathrm{new}} + (1-\\theta) T_{\\mathrm{h,out}}^{(k-1)} $$\n        $$ T_{\\mathrm{c,out}}^{(k)} = \\theta T_{\\mathrm{c,out}}^{\\mathrm{new}} + (1-\\theta) T_{\\mathrm{c,out}}^{(k-1)} $$\n        These values, $T_{\\mathrm{out}}^{(k)}$, become the input for the next iteration.\n\n3.  **Termination**:\n    The loop terminates when $|\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{h,out}}|$ and $|\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{c,out}}|$ are both less than $10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The final converged outlet temperatures, along with the corresponding effectiveness $\\varepsilon$ and $\\mathrm{NTU}$ from the final iteration, constitute the solution for the given case.\n\nThis structured, iterative procedure correctly models the physical interdependencies and robustly converges to the heat exchanger's operating point. The implementation will encapsulate these steps within a program that processes each specified test case.", "answer": "[[536.812239,420.258950,0.612885,1.139682],[718.369871,684.691774,0.408151,0.738164],[390.871146,344.020581,0.697096,1.196924]]", "id": "2492821"}]}
