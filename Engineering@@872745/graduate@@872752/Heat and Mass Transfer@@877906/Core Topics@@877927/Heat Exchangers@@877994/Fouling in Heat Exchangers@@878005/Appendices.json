Applying the limits of integration:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{k_{r}} \\left( \\ln(k_{d} - k_{r}R_{f}(t)) - \\ln(k_{d}) \\right) = t\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we combine the terms:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{k_{r}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{d} - k_{r}R_{f}(t)}{k_{d}}\\right) = t\n$$\nMultiplying by $-k_{r}$ and exponentiating both sides gives:\n$$\n\\frac{k_{d} - k_{r}R_{f}(t)}{k_{d}} = \\exp(-k_{r} t)\n$$\n$$\n1 - \\frac{k_{r}}{k_{d}}R_{f}(t) = \\exp(-k_{r} t)\n$$\nSolving for $R_{f}(t)$:\n$$\nR_{f}(t) = \\frac{k_{d}}{k_{r}}\\left(1 - \\exp(-k_{r} t)\\right)\n$$\nThis is the expression for the fouling resistance as a function of time.\n\nNext, we determine the asymptotic fouling resistance, $R_{f,\\infty}$, by taking the limit as $t \\to \\infty$:\n$$\nR_{f,\\infty} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} R_{f}(t) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left[\\frac{k_{d}}{k_{r}}\\left(1 - \\exp(-k_{r} t)\\right)\\right]\n$$\nSince $k_{r} > 0$, the term $\\exp(-k_{r} t)$ approaches $0$ as $t \\to \\infty$. Therefore:\n$$\nR_{f,\\infty} = \\frac{k_{d}}{k_{r}}\n$$\nThis result can also be obtained by setting the rate of change to zero in the original differential equation, which corresponds to the steady-state or asymptotic condition: $0 = k_{d} - k_{r}R_{f,\\infty}$, which yields $R_{f,\\infty} = k_{d}/k_{r}$.\n\nNow, we must find the time $t_{0.9}$ at which $R_{f}(t)$ reaches $90\\%$ of its asymptotic value, i.e., $R_{f}(t_{0.9}) = 0.9 R_{f,\\infty}$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $R_{f}(t)$ and $R_{f,\\infty}$:\n$$\n\\frac{k_{d}}{k_{r}}\\left(1 - \\exp(-k_{r} t_{0.9})\\right) = 0.9 \\left(\\frac{k_{d}}{k_{r}}\\right)\n$$\nThe non-zero term $k_{d}/k_{r}$ cancels from both sides:\n$$\n1 - \\exp(-k_{r} t_{0.9}) = 0.9\n$$\nRearranging the terms to solve for the exponential:\n$$\n\\exp(-k_{r} t_{0.9}) = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-k_{r} t_{0.9} = \\ln(0.1) = \\ln(10^{-1}) = -\\ln(10)\n$$\nSolving for $t_{0.9}$:\n$$\nt_{0.9} = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{k_{r}}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the definition $\\beta \\equiv k_{r}$ into this expression:\n$$\nt_{0.9} = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{\\beta}\n$$\nThe units of $\\beta$ are inverse time, so the units of $t_{0.9}$ are time. If $\\beta$ is given in units of $s^{-1}$, then $t_{0.9}$ will be in seconds, as requested.\n\nFor the qualitative discussion:\nThe parameter $\\beta$, equivalent to $k_r$, represents the rate constant for the shear-driven removal of foulant from the heat transfer surface. This removal process is a direct consequence of the fluid dynamic forces exerted by the flow on the deposited layer. The primary force responsible for this detachment is the fluid shear stress at the wall, $\\tau_{w}$.\n1.  **Effect on $\\beta$**: An increase in the bulk fluid velocity or turbulence intensity leads to a higher wall shear stress $\\tau_{w}$. A greater shear stress imparts a larger tangential force on the foulant deposits, increasing the probability and rate of their detachment and re-entrainment into the fluid. Therefore, an increase in wall shear will strengthen the removal mechanism. In the context of the model, this corresponds to an increase in the value of the removal rate constant $k_r$. As $\\beta \\equiv k_r$, increasing wall shear directly increases $\\beta$.\n2.  **Effect on $t_{0.9}$**: The time to reach $90\\%$ of the asymptotic fouling resistance is given by $t_{0.9} = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{\\beta}$. Since $\\beta$ appears in the denominator of this expression, an increase in $\\beta$ will cause a decrease in $t_{0.9}$.\n3.  **Explanation**: A higher wall shear not only leads to a lower final amount of fouling accumulation (since $R_{f,\\infty} = k_d/\\beta$ decreases), but it also accelerates the approach to this new, lower equilibrium state. The system reaches its dynamic balance between deposition and removal more quickly when the removal process is more vigorous. Consequently, the time required to reach any given fraction of the asymptotic fouling level, such as $t_{0.9}$, is reduced.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\ln(10)}{\\beta}}\n$$", "id": "2489349"}, {"introduction": "In practice, the fouling resistance $R_f(t)$ cannot be measured directly; it must be inferred from the overall performance of the heat exchanger.

It presents a well-posed, scientifically-grounded problem in engineering system identification, concerning the monitoring of fouling in a heat exchanger. The assumptions and provided information are internally consistent and sufficient for a rigorous analysis. We shall proceed to the solution.\n\nThe fundamental relationship governing the quasi-steady state thermal performance of the heat exchanger is given by the sum of thermal resistances:\n$$ \\frac{1}{U(t)A} = R_{\\text{total}}(t) = R_{h}(t) + R_{c}(t) + R_w + R_{f}(t) $$\nThe total resistance per unit of area, $\\frac{1}{U(t)}$, is derived from experimental measurements via the heat duty, $q(t)$, and the Logarithmic Mean Temperature Difference, $\\text{LMTD}(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{U(t)} = \\frac{A \\cdot \\text{LMTD}(t)}{q(t)} $$\nwhere $q(t)$ is found from an energy balance on either the hot or cold stream, for example:\n$$ q(t) = \\dot{m}_{h}(t) c_{p,h}(t) (T_{h,\\text{in}}(t) - T_{h,\\text{out}}(t)) $$\nThe convective resistances, $R_h(t) = \\frac{1}{h_h(t)A}$ and $R_c(t) = \\frac{1}{h_c(t)A}$, depend on the convective heat transfer coefficients $h_h(t)$ and $h_c(t)$. These coefficients are themselves functions of the respective Reynolds numbers, $Re_h(t)$ and $Re_c(t)$, which are directly related to the measured mass flow rates $\\dot{m}_h(t)$ and $\\dot{m}_c(t)$. The functional forms of $h_h(Re_h)$ and $h_c(Re_c)$ are unknown. The wall conduction resistance, $R_w$, is known and constant. The fouling resistance, $R_f(t)$, is the target variable to be identified.\n\nThe central challenge is the mathematical entanglement of the unknown convective correlations and the unknown fouling resistance. A change in the measured total resistance $\\frac{1}{U(t)A}$ could be due to a change in flow rates (affecting $h_h, h_c$) or due to the evolution of fouling (affecting $R_f$). To achieve structural identifiability for $R_f(t)$, one must design an experiment that decouples these effects. The problem provides a critical piece of information for this purpose: the separation of timescales, $\\tau_f \\gg \\tau_{\\mathrm{th}}$, where $\\tau_f$ is the characteristic time for fouling evolution and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}}$ is the thermal time constant of the exchanger. This allows for experiments of an intermediate duration $T$, where $\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}} \\ll T \\ll \\tau_f$, during which the fouling resistance $R_f(t)$ can be considered constant while the convective coefficients can be dynamically varied by manipulating flow rates under quasi-steady thermal conditions.\n\nWe now evaluate each proposed option.\n\n**A. Impose quasi-static triangular ramps in $\\dot{m}_{h}(t)$...**\nThis option proposes a classical one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) experimental design. The choice of ramp period $T_r$ such that $\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}} \\ll T_r \\ll \\tau_f$ is a rigorous application of the timescale separation principle. The condition $T_r \\gg \\tau_{\\mathrm{th}}$ ensures the system responds in a quasi-steady manner, validating the use of the steady-state LMTD method at each instant. The condition $T_r \\ll \\tau_f$ ensures $R_f(t)$ remains constant, let us say $R_f^*$, throughout the experiment.\n\nFirst, holding $\\dot{m}_c(t)$ constant makes $Re_c$ and thus $h_c$ and $R_c$ constant. The governing equation for this experiment becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{U(t)A} = \\frac{1}{h_h(Re_h(t))A} + \\left( R_c + R_w + R_f^* \\right) $$\nThe term in parentheses is an unknown but constant value. By collecting data pairs of $\\left( \\frac{1}{U(t)A}, Re_h(t) \\right)$ across the ramp, one can perform a regression analysis to identify the parameters of the unknown correlation $h_h(Re_h)$ and the lumped constant term. Symmetrically, a second experiment varying $\\dot{m}_c(t)$ while holding $\\dot{m}_h(t)$ constant allows for the identification of the $h_c(Re_c)$ correlation.\nOnce both correlations are identified, they can be used during normal operation. At any time $t$, $R_f(t)$ is uniquely determined by subtracting the calculated resistances from the measured total resistance:\n$$ R_f(t) = \\frac{1}{U(t)A} - \\frac{1}{h_h(Re_h(t))A} - \\frac{1}{h_c(Re_c(t))A} - R_w $$\nThis procedure is sound, logical, and directly addresses the identifiability problem.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Keep both mass flow rates constant in time and estimate simultaneously...**\nThis proposal suggests constant flow rates, $\\dot{m}_h$ and $\\dot{m}_c$. Consequently, $Re_h$ and $Re_c$ are constant, and so are the convective coefficients $h_h$ and $h_c$. The governing equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{1}{U(t)A} = \\left( \\frac{1}{h_h A} + \\frac{1}{h_c A} + R_w \\right) + R_f(t) $$\nThe term in parentheses is a constant, let us call it $C$. The measurable quantity is the total resistance, $\\frac{1}{U(t)A}$. We have a single time-varying measurement from which we wish to determine a time-varying function $R_f(t)$ and a constant $C$ which contains the two unknown constants $h_h$ and $h_c$. The equation is $\\frac{1}{U(t)A} = C + R_f(t)$. Without knowing the initial state (e.g., $R_f(0)=0$ for a clean exchanger), it is impossible to separate the constant offset $C$ from the absolute value of $R_f(t)$. We can only ever determine the change in fouling resistance relative to an initial time $t_0$, i.e., $R_f(t) - R_f(t_0)$. The absolute values of $h_h$, $h_c$, and $R_f(t)$ are not structurally identifiable. The claim that this is identifiable is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Use fast step changes in $\\dot{m}_{h}(t)$ and $\\dot{m}_{c}(t)$...**\nThis option proposes using fast transients where the period of change $T_s$ is comparable to the thermal time constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}}$. This experimental condition invalidates the quasi-steady assumption upon which the LMTD and simple series-resistance models are based. A full dynamic model based on partial differential equations involving thermal capacitances $(\\rho c_p V)$ would be required. The statement claims that the resulting temperature lags \"can be attributed uniquely to $R_f(t)$\". This is a fundamental error. The thermal lags are a function of *all* thermal capacitances and *all* thermal resistances in the system, including $R_h$ and $R_c$. A change in $R_f$ will affect the system's dynamic response, but so will a change in $h_h$ or $h_c$. Their effects on the dynamics are convoluted. This approach does not simplify the decoupling; it complicates the modeling and does not provide a unique signature for fouling.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Apply persistently exciting piecewise-linear ramps of $\\dot{m}_{h}(t)$ and $\\dot{m}_{c}(t)$...**\nThis option is a more sophisticated and generalized version of option A. It correctly employs the timescale separation, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}} \\ll T \\ll \\tau_f$, to justify a quasi-steady model with a constant fouling resistance $R_f^*$ over the experimental window $T$. By applying \"persistently exciting\" signals to both $\\dot{m}_h(t)$ and $\\dot{m}_c(t)$, it ensures that the collected data is sufficiently rich to resolve the contributions from both $h_h(Re_h)$ and $h_c(Re_c)$. This avoids issues of parameter collinearity that can arise from poorly designed experiments. The data is used in a multivariable nonlinear regression to fit the parameters of the assumed correlation forms (e.g., $C$ and $n$ in $h \\propto Re^n$) alongside the constant term $(R_w + R_f^*)$. This is a standard and powerful technique in system identification. The mention of using pressure drop data to regress friction factor correlations, which can be linked to heat transfer via analogies, further strengthens the methodology. Once the correlations for $h_h$ and $h_c$ are determined, $R_f(t)$ can be monitored as a residual, as in option A.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. Modulate only the inlet temperatures of one stream at constant mass flow rates...**\nThis option proposes constant mass flow rates, which, as in option B, means $h_h$ and $h_c$ are constant (ignoring minor temperature-dependent property effects). Modulating an inlet temperature will vary the heat duty $q(t)$ and the LMTD, but their ratio, the total resistance $\\frac{A \\cdot \\text{LMTD}(t)}{q(t)}$, remains governed by the same flawed equation from option B:\n$$ \\frac{1}{U(t)A} = C + R_f(t) $$\nThe experiment provides no information to distinguish the constant convective resistances (lumped in $C$) from the fouling resistance $R_f(t)$. Varying the temperature driving force does not help to identify flow-dependent coefficients, precisely because the flows are held constant. The argument that because $h$ is independent of the driving force, this method works, is a non-sequitur; the method fails because it provides no mechanism to estimate the unknown (but constant) values of $h$. The identifiability problem remains unsolved.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2489388"}]}
