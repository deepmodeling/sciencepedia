For a function $f$ of a single variable $x$ with uncertainty $u_x$, the uncertainty in the function, $u_f$, is approximated to first order by:\n$$ u_f \\approx \\left| \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\right| u_x $$\nIn our case, the function is $U_o(t_w)$, and the variable with uncertainty is $t_w$. The uncertainty in $U_o$ is therefore:\n$$ u_{U_o} = \\left| \\frac{\\partial U_o}{\\partial t_w} \\right| u_t $$\nWe must compute the partial derivative of $U_o$ with respect to $t_w$, which represents the sensitivity of $U_o$ to changes in $t_w$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial U_o}{\\partial t_w} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t_w} \\left[ U_i \\left( 1 - \\frac{2 t_w}{d_o} \\right) \\right] $$\nSince $U_i$ and $d_o$ are treated as constants for this differentiation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial U_o}{\\partial t_w} = U_i \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t_w} \\left( 1 - \\frac{2 t_w}{d_o} \\right) = U_i \\left( 0 - \\frac{2}{d_o} \\right) = -\\frac{2 U_i}{d_o} $$\nThe relationship between $U_o$ and $t_w$ is linear, so the first-order approximation is exact. Substituting the derivative back into the uncertainty formula:\n$$ u_{U_o} = \\left| -\\frac{2 U_i}{d_o} \\right| u_t = \\frac{2 U_i}{d_o} u_t $$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the standard uncertainty $u_{U_o}$.\n\nFinally, we must compute the numerical value of $u_{U_o}$ using the provided data.\nThe given values are:\n- $U_i = 1.450 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-2}\\, K^{-1}}$\n- $d_o = 19.05\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 1.905 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $u_t = 0.050\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\nIt is critical that all units are consistent. We will use SI base units.\n$$ u_{U_o} = \\frac{2 \\times (1.450 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-2}\\, K^{-1}})}{1.905 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m}} \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}) $$\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$ u_{U_o} = \\frac{2 \\times 1450}{0.01905} \\times 5.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-2}\\, K^{-1}} $$\n$$ u_{U_o} = \\frac{2900 \\times 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}}{0.01905} \\ \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-2}\\, K^{-1}} $$\n$$ u_{U_o} = \\frac{0.145}{0.01905} \\ \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-2}\\, K^{-1}} $$\n$$ u_{U_o} \\approx 7.611548556\\ \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-2}\\, K^{-1}} $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ u_{U_o} \\approx 7.61\\ \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-2}\\, K^{-1}} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.61}$$", "id": "2513467"}]}
