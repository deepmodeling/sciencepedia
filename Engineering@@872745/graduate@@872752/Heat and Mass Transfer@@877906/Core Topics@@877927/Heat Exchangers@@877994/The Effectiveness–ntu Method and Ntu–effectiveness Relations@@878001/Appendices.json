The language is objective and precise. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nDerivation and Solution\n\nThe analysis begins with the steady-flow energy balance for an adiabatic heat exchanger. The rate of heat transfer, $q$, lost by the hot stream is equal to the rate of heat gained by the cold stream.\n\nFor the hot stream:\n$q = \\dot{m}_{h} c_{p,h} (T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{h,\\mathrm{out}}) = C_{h} (T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{h,\\mathrm{out}})$\nFor the cold stream:\n$q = \\dot{m}_{c} c_{p,c} (T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}) = C_{c} (T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}})$\n\nHere, $C_{h} = \\dot{m}_{h} c_{p,h}$ and $C_{c} = \\dot{m}_{c} c_{p,c}$ are the heat capacity rates of the hot and cold streams, respectively.\n\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics dictates that heat can only transfer from a region of higher temperature to a region of lower temperature. In a heat exchanger, this means that at any location along the flow path, the temperature of the hot fluid must be greater than or equal to the temperature of the cold fluid. For a counterflow heat exchanger, the limiting temperature conditions occur at the inlets and outlets:\n$T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} \\ge T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}$\n$T_{h,\\mathrm{out}} \\ge T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}$\n\nWe can express the outlet temperatures in terms of the heat transfer rate, $q$:\n$T_{h,\\mathrm{out}} = T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - \\frac{q}{C_{h}}$\n$T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} = T_{c,\\mathrm{in}} + \\frac{q}{C_{c}}$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the Second Law constraints yields two upper bounds for $q$:\n1. From $T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} \\ge T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}$:\n$T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} \\ge T_{c,\\mathrm{in}} + \\frac{q}{C_{c}} \\implies q \\le C_{c} (T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}})$\n2. From $T_{h,\\mathrm{out}} \\ge T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}$:\n$T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - \\frac{q}{C_{h}} \\ge T_{c,\\mathrm{in}} \\implies q \\le C_{h} (T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}})$\n\nTo satisfy both constraints simultaneously, the heat transfer rate $q$ must not exceed the smaller of these two bounds. Let $C_{\\min} = \\min(C_{h}, C_{c})$. The maximum possible heat transfer rate, $q_{\\max}$, is therefore limited by the fluid with the minimum heat capacity rate and the maximum possible temperature difference across the exchanger, which is $(T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}})$.\nThe general upper bound is:\n$q_{\\max} = C_{\\min} (T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}})$\n\nThis theoretical maximum is attained in the reversible limit, which corresponds to an ideal heat exchanger with an infinitely large surface area. In this limit:\n- If $C_{h} = C_{\\min}$, setting $q = q_{\\max}$ in the energy balance for the hot stream gives $C_{h} (T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}) = C_{h} (T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{h,\\mathrm{out}})$, which implies the outlet temperature of the hot stream reaches the inlet temperature of the cold stream: $T_{h,\\mathrm{out}} = T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}$.\n- If $C_{c} = C_{\\min}$, setting $q = q_{\\max}$ in the energy balance for the cold stream gives $C_{c} (T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}) = C_{c} (T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}})$, which implies the outlet temperature of the cold stream reaches the inlet temperature of the hot stream: $T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} = T_{h,\\mathrm{in}}$.\n\nTherefore, the fluid with the minimum heat capacity rate ($C_{\\min}$) is the one that could theoretically undergo the maximum temperature change, with its outlet temperature approaching the inlet temperature of the other fluid.\n\nNow, we compute the required quantities using the given data.\n\n1) and 2) Heat Capacity Rates ($C_{\\min}$ and $C_{\\max}$):\nFirst, calculate $C_{h}$ and $C_{c}$. The specific heats are given in $\\mathrm{kJ/(kg\\cdot K)}$, so the heat capacity rates will be in $\\mathrm{kW/K}$.\n$C_{h} = \\dot{m}_{h} c_{p,h} = (0.9200\\ \\mathrm{kg/s})(3.850\\ \\mathrm{kJ/(kg\\cdot K)}) = 3.542\\ \\mathrm{kW/K}$\n$C_{c} = \\dot{m}_{c} c_{p,c} = (1.350\\ \\mathrm{kg/s})(4.120\\ \\mathrm{kJ/(kg\\cdot K)}) = 5.562\\ \\mathrm{kW/K}$\n\nComparing these values:\n$C_{h} = 3.542\\ \\mathrm{kW/K}$\n$C_{c} = 5.562\\ \\mathrm{kW/K}$\nThus, the minimum and maximum heat capacity rates are:\n$C_{\\min} = C_{h} = 3.542\\ \\mathrm{kW/K}$\n$C_{\\max} = C_{c} = 5.562\\ \\mathrm{kW/K}$\n\n3) Maximum Possible Heat Transfer Rate ($q_{\\max}$):\n$q_{\\max}$ is calculated using $C_{\\min}$ and the overall temperature difference.\n$q_{\\max} = C_{\\min} (T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}})$\n$q_{\\max} = (3.542\\ \\mathrm{kW/K}) (430.0\\ \\mathrm{K} - 310.0\\ \\mathrm{K})$\n$q_{\\max} = (3.542\\ \\mathrm{kW/K}) (120.0\\ \\mathrm{K}) = 425.04\\ \\mathrm{kW}$\nRounding to four significant figures, $q_{\\max} = 425.0\\ \\mathrm{kW}$.\n\n4) Reversible-Limit Outlet Temperature of the $C_{\\min}$ Stream:\nThe stream with $C_{\\min}$ is the hot stream ($C_h$).

It is a standard derivation problem in the field of heat transfer, requiring application of fundamental principles. We will proceed with the derivation as requested.\n\nThe analysis begins with the principle of conservation of energy applied to a differential area element $dA$ within the heat exchanger. For a two-stream heat exchanger operating at steady state, the rate of heat transfer $dQ$ across this element is given by the rate equation:\n$$dQ = U (T_h - T_c) dA$$\nwhere $U$ is the overall heat transfer coefficient, and $T_h$ and $T_c$ are the local temperatures of the hot and cold fluids, respectively.\n\nEnergy balances on the two fluid streams as they pass over the area $dA$ yield:\n$$dQ = -C_h dT_h$$\n$$dQ = \\sigma C_c dT_c$$\nHere, $C_h$ and $C_c$ are the heat capacity rates of the hot and cold fluids, defined as $C = \\dot{m} c_p$. The term $dT_h$ represents the infinitesimal change in the hot fluid temperature, which is negative as heat is transferred from it. The term $dT_c$ is the change in the cold fluid temperature. The factor $\\sigma$ depends on the flow arrangement: for parallel flow, $\\sigma = +1$ as both temperatures change in the same direction along the exchanger length; for counterflow, $\\sigma = -1$ as the temperatures change in opposite directions along a given spatial coordinate.\n\nFrom the energy balances, we express the differential temperature changes as:\n$$dT_h = -\\frac{dQ}{C_h}$$\n$$dT_c = \\sigma \\frac{dQ}{C_c}$$\nThe differential change in the temperature difference, $\\Delta T = T_h - T_c$, is then:\n$$d(\\Delta T) = dT_h - dT_c = -\\frac{dQ}{C_h} - \\sigma \\frac{dQ}{C_c} = -dQ \\left(\\frac{1}{C_h} + \\frac{\\sigma}{C_c}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the rate equation $dQ = U \\Delta T dA$, we obtain a first-order ordinary differential equation for $\\Delta T$:\n$$\\frac{d(\\Delta T)}{\\Delta T} = -U \\left(\\frac{1}{C_h} + \\frac{\\sigma}{C_c}\\right) dA$$\n\nWe will now integrate this equation for each flow arrangement.\n\n**Part 1: Parallel Flow Arrangement ($\\sigma = +1$)**\nFor parallel flow, both fluids enter at one end of the exchanger (say, at area $A=0$) and exit at the other end ($A=A_{total}$).

We apply L'Hôpital's rule by differentiating the numerator and denominator with respect to $C_r$. Let $N(C_r) = 1 - \\exp[-\\mathrm{NTU}(1-C_r)]$ and $D(C_r) = 1 - C_r\\exp[-\\mathrm{NTU}(1-C_r)]$.

As $\\mathrm{NTU} \\to \\infty$, both fluid outlet temperatures approach the arithmetic mean of the inlet temperatures, $T_{out} \\to (T_{h,in}+T_{c,in})/2$. The maximum possible temperature change for either fluid is $(T_{h,in}-T_{c,in})/2$. Thus, the maximum effectiveness is $\\epsilon_{max} = \\frac{C(T_{in}-T_{out})}{C(T_{h,in}-T_{c,in})} = \\frac{T_{in} - (T_{h,in}+T_{c,in})/2}{T_{h,in}-T_{c,in}} = \\frac{(T_{h,in}-T_{c,in})/2}{T_{h,in}-T_{c,in}} = 1/2$. This heat exchange \"penalty\" arises because the driving temperature difference diminishes rapidly.\nIn counterflow with $C_r=1$, the temperature difference $T_h(x)-T_c(x)$ is constant throughout the exchanger. This allows for a much more efficient thermal energy transfer.

The monitored quantity is the overall heat transfer coefficient (OHTC), denoted by $U$, which is subject to measurement uncertainty. To quantify how uncertainty in $U$ propagates to uncertainty in the heat exchanger effectiveness, consider the local sensitivity coefficient $\\partial \\epsilon / \\partial U$ with the heat capacity rate ratio $C_r$ and the heat transfer area $A$ held fixed.\n\nLet the minimum heat capacity rate be $C_{\\min}$, the maximum heat capacity rate be $C_{\\max}$, and the capacity rate ratio be $C_r \\equiv C_{\\min}/C_{\\max}$. The Number of Transfer Units (NTU) is defined by $\\mathrm{NTU} \\equiv UA/C_{\\min}$.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in the field of heat transfer, requiring the application of standard engineering formulas and calculus for sensitivity analysis. All necessary data are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe task is to derive an analytical expression for the sensitivity coefficient $\\frac{\\partial \\epsilon}{\\partial U}$ and evaluate it at a given operating point. The heat exchanger is of the counterflow type.\n\nThe heat exchanger effectiveness $\\epsilon$ is a function of the Number of Transfer Units, $\\mathrm{NTU}$, and the heat capacity rate ratio, $C_r \\equiv C_{\\min}/C_{\\max}$. The Number of Transfer Units is defined as $\\mathrm{NTU} \\equiv \\frac{UA}{C_{\\min}}$. Since we are asked to find the partial derivative of $\\epsilon$ with respect to the overall heat transfer coefficient $U$ while holding the area $A$ and the capacity rate ratio $C_r$ fixed, we must treat $\\epsilon$ as a composite function of $U$. That is, $\\epsilon(\\mathrm{NTU}(U))$.\n\nWe apply the chain rule for differentiation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\epsilon}{\\partial U} = \\frac{d\\epsilon}{d\\mathrm{NTU}} \\frac{\\partial \\mathrm{NTU}}{\\partial U} $$\n\nFirst, we determine the term $\\frac{\\partial \\mathrm{NTU}}{\\partial U}$.

For a counterflow heat exchanger with $C_r < 1$, the effectiveness-NTU relation is given by:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{1 - \\exp[-\\mathrm{NTU}(1 - C_r)]}{1 - C_r \\exp[-\\mathrm{NTU}(1 - C_r)]} $$\nTo find the derivative of $\\epsilon$ with respect to $\\mathrm{NTU}$, we use the quotient rule, $\\frac{d}{dx}(\\frac{f}{g}) = \\frac{f'g - fg'}{g^2}$.\nLet $f(\\mathrm{NTU}) = 1 - \\exp[-\\mathrm{NTU}(1 - C_r)]$ and $g(\\mathrm{NTU}) = 1 - C_r \\exp[-\\mathrm{NTU}(1 - C_r)]$.\nThe derivatives with respect to $\\mathrm{NTU}$ are:\n$$ \\frac{df}{d\\mathrm{NTU}} = (1 - C_r) \\exp[-\\mathrm{NTU}(1 - C_r)] $$\n$$ \\frac{dg}{d\\mathrm{NTU}} = C_r(1 - C_r) \\exp[-\\mathrm{NTU}(1 - C_r)] $$\nApplying the quotient rule, the numerator of $\\frac{d\\epsilon}{d\\mathrm{NTU}}$ is $f'g - fg'$:\n$$ (1-C_r)\\exp[-\\mathrm{NTU}(1-C_r)](1 - C_r \\exp[-\\mathrm{NTU}(1 - C_r)]) - (1 - \\exp[-\\mathrm{NTU}(1 - C_r)])C_r(1 - C_r)\\exp[-\\mathrm{NTU}(1 - C_r)] $$\nLet $X = \\exp[-\\mathrm{NTU}(1 - C_r)]$ for simplicity. The numerator becomes:\n$$ (1-C_r)X(1 - C_r X) - (1-X)C_r(1-C_r)X $$\nFactoring out the term $(1-C_r)X$:\n$$ (1-C_r)X [(1 - C_r X) - C_r(1-X)] $$\n$$ = (1-C_r)X [1 - C_r X - C_r + C_r X] $$\n$$ = (1-C_r)X (1-C_r) = (1-C_r)^2 X $$\nSubstituting $X$ back, the numerator is $(1-C_r)^2 \\exp[-\\mathrm{NTU}(1-C_r)]$.\nThe denominator of the derivative is $g^2 = (1 - C_r \\exp[-\\mathrm{NTU}(1-C_r)])^2$.\nSo, the derivative is:\n$$ \\frac{d\\epsilon}{d\\mathrm{NTU}} = \\frac{(1-C_r)^2 \\exp[-\\mathrm{NTU}(1-C_r)]}{(1 - C_r \\exp[-\\mathrm{NTU}(1-C_r)])^2} $$\n\nCombining the parts, we obtain the analytical expression for the sensitivity coefficient:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\epsilon}{\\partial U} = \\left( \\frac{(1-C_r)^2 \\exp[-\\mathrm{NTU}(1-C_r)]}{(1 - C_r \\exp[-\\mathrm{NTU}(1-C_r)])^2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{A}{C_{\\min}} \\right) $$\nwhere $\\mathrm{NTU} = \\frac{UA}{C_{\\min}}$.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the provided baseline operating point values:\n$U = 750\\ \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n$A = 60\\ \\mathrm{m}^2$\n$C_{\\min} = 3.00 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n$C_r = 0.60$\n\nFirst, we calculate the Number of Transfer Units:\n$$ \\mathrm{NTU} = \\frac{UA}{C_{\\min}} = \\frac{750 \\times 60}{3.00 \\times 10^{4}} = \\frac{45000}{30000} = 1.5 $$\nNext, we calculate the term $1-C_r$:\n$$ 1-C_r = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40 $$\nThe argument of the exponential function is:\n$$ -\\mathrm{NTU}(1-C_r) = -1.5 \\times 0.40 = -0.6 $$\nNow, we calculate the derivative $\\frac{d\\epsilon}{d\\mathrm{NTU}}$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\epsilon}{d\\mathrm{NTU}} = \\frac{(0.40)^2 \\exp(-0.6)}{(1 - 0.60 \\exp(-0.6))^2} = \\frac{0.16 \\exp(-0.6)}{(1 - 0.60 \\exp(-0.6))^2} $$\nUsing the value $\\exp(-0.6) \\approx 0.54881$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\epsilon}{d\\mathrm{NTU}} \\approx \\frac{0.16 \\times 0.54881}{(1 - 0.60 \\times 0.54881)^2} = \\frac{0.087810}{(1 - 0.32929)^2} = \\frac{0.087810}{(0.67071)^2} \\approx \\frac{0.087810}{0.44985} \\approx 0.19519 $$\nNext, we calculate the term $\\frac{A}{C_{\\min}}$:\n$$ \\frac{A}{C_{\\min}} = \\frac{60}{3.00 \\times 10^{4}} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{K}\\,\\mathrm{W}^{-1} $$\nFinally, we compute the sensitivity coefficient $\\frac{\\partial \\epsilon}{\\partial U}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\epsilon}{\\partial U} = \\frac{d\\epsilon}{d\\mathrm{NTU}} \\times \\frac{A}{C_{\\min}} \\approx 0.19519 \\times (2.00 \\times 10^{-3}) \\approx 0.00039038\\ \\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{K}\\,\\mathrm{W}^{-1} $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $0.0003904\\ \\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{K}\\,\\mathrm{W}^{-1}$, or $3.904 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{K}\\,\\mathrm{W}^{-1}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.904 \\times 10^{-4}}$$", "id": "2528677"}]}
