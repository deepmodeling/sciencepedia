No flaws are detected.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by deriving the required expressions before numerical substitution.\n\nFirst, an order-of-magnitude expression for the convective heat transfer coefficient, $h$, is derived. The problem provides the scaling law for the Nusselt number, $Nu_{L}$, as a function of the Rayleigh number, $Ra_{L}$:\n$$Nu_{L} \\sim Ra_{L}^{1/4}$$\nFor an order-of-magnitude analysis, we treat this proportionality as an approximate equality, $Nu_{L} \\approx Ra_{L}^{1/4}$. The Nusselt and Rayleigh numbers are defined as:\n$$Nu_{L} \\equiv \\frac{hL}{k}$$\n$$Ra_{L} \\equiv \\frac{g\\beta\\Delta T L^3}{\\nu\\alpha}$$\nwhere $h$ is the convective heat transfer coefficient, $L$ is the characteristic length (the plate height), $k$ is the thermal conductivity of the fluid, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\\beta$ is the coefficient of thermal expansion, $\\Delta T$ is the temperature difference, $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, and $\\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nSubstituting these definitions into the scaling relation gives:\n$$\\frac{hL}{k} \\approx \\left( \\frac{g\\beta\\Delta T L^3}{\\nu\\alpha} \\right)^{1/4}$$\nSolving for $h$, we obtain the desired expression:\n$$h \\approx \\frac{k}{L} \\left( \\frac{g\\beta\\Delta T L^3}{\\nu\\alpha} \\right)^{1/4} = k \\left( \\frac{g\\beta\\Delta T}{\\nu\\alpha L} \\right)^{1/4}$$\n\nNext, we define the conduction-only baseline heat transfer coefficient, $h_{\\mathrm{cond}}$. This coefficient corresponds to heat transfer by pure conduction through a stagnant fluid layer of thickness $L$. According to Fourier's law of conduction, the heat flux $q''$ across this layer is:\n$$q'' = k \\frac{\\Delta T}{L}$$\nBy definition, the heat transfer coefficient relates heat flux to the temperature difference via Newton's law of cooling, $q'' = h \\Delta T$. For the pure conduction case, this becomes:\n$$q'' = h_{\\mathrm{cond}} \\Delta T$$\nEquating the two expressions for $q''$ yields the definition of $h_{\\mathrm{cond}}$:\n$$h_{\\mathrm{cond}} = \\frac{k}{L}$$\n\nThe enhancement factor $E$ is defined as the ratio $h/h_{\\mathrm{cond}}$:\n$$E = \\frac{h}{h_{\\mathrm{cond}}} = \\frac{ \\frac{k}{L} Nu_L }{ \\frac{k}{L} } = Nu_L$$\nThis result is fundamental: the Nusselt number is precisely the ratio of convective heat transfer to the heat transfer that would occur by pure conduction over the same characteristic length. Using the given scaling, the enhancement factor is:\n$$E \\approx Ra_{L}^{1/4}$$\n\nWe now proceed with the numerical calculation.

We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe primary objective is to derive the linearized relation for the relative density variation, evaluate its magnitude, and then analyze the error introduced by this approximation in the context of natural convection correlations.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the coefficient of volumetric thermal expansion, $\\beta$, for an ideal gas. The ideal gas law is given as:\n$$p = \\rho R T$$\nwhere $p$ is the pressure, $\\rho$ is the density, $R$ is the specific gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.

Thus, the Rayleigh number is also overestimated by the same relative amount:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{Ra}_{\\text{Boussinesq}}}{\\mathrm{Ra}_{\\text{exact}}} = 1 + \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{\\infty}}$$\nGiven a Nusselt number correlation of the form $\\mathrm{Nu} \\propto \\mathrm{Ra}^n$, the error propagates to the Nusselt number as follows:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{Nu}_{\\text{Boussinesq}}}{\\mathrm{Nu}_{\\text{exact}}} = \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{Ra}_{\\text{Boussinesq}}}{\\mathrm{Ra}_{\\text{exact}}}\\right)^n = \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{\\infty}}\\right)^n$$\nFor small values of $\\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{\\infty}}$, a binomial expansion yields $\\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{\\infty}}\\right)^n \\approx 1 + n \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{\\infty}}$.

For $Pr \\ll 1$ (strong thermal diffusion), the thermal boundary layer is thick and temperature gradients are mild, weakening the coupling that drives shear instabilities (transition downstream). A $Gr_x$-only threshold, lacking $Pr$, cannot reflect these opposing tendencies.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This statement aligns with the non-dimensionalization: $Pr$ enters the coupled problem via the energy equation, and $Ra_x = Gr_x\\,Pr$ emerges as the composite control parameter. A $Gr_x$-only criterion neglects the role of thermal diffusion for $Pr \\neq 1$. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. This asserts independence from $Pr$, contrary to the governing equations and the demonstrated $Pr$-sensitivity of transition predictions. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. This reverses the actual dependencies: with fixed $\\nu$, $Gr_x$-based predictions do not depend on $\\alpha$ and thus give the same $x_t$, whereas $Ra_x$-based predictions differ. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. The numerical values are consistent with the computations above and the physical interpretation: $x_{t,Gr} \\approx 0.12\\ \\mathrm{m}$ for both fluids; $x_{t,Ra} \\approx 0.025\\ \\mathrm{m}$ for $Pr = 100$; $x_{t,Ra} \\approx 0.53\\ \\mathrm{m}$ for $Pr = 0.01$. The trend supports the Rayleigh-based criterion. Verdict — Correct.\n\nE. For $Pr \\ll 1$, we found $x_{t,Gr} \\approx 0.116\\ \\mathrm{m}$ while $x_{t,Ra} \\approx 0.536\\ \\mathrm{m}$, i.e., the $Gr_x$-based prediction is earlier (smaller $x$) than the $Ra_x$-based one. Thus, using $Gr_x$ would overpredict the streamwise extent of turbulence (and associated turbulent heat transfer) relative to a Rayleigh-based assessment. Verdict — Correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ADE}$$", "id": "2511088"}]}
