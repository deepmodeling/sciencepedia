It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions, missing data, or conceptual flaws. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a rigorous solution can be constructed.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this problem is the conservation of energy. For a general control volume, the energy balance is stated as $\\dot{E}_{in} - \\dot{E}_{out} + \\dot{E}_{gen} = \\dot{E}_{st}$, where the terms represent the rates of energy entering, leaving, being generated within, and being stored within the volume, respectively. For the specified conditions of steady, one-dimensional heat conduction in the $x$-direction with no internal heat generation, the differential form of this principle for a planar geometry simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(k\\frac{dT}{dx}\\right) = 0\n$$\nHere, $k$ is the thermal conductivity and $T$ is the temperature. The heat flux, $q^{\\prime\\prime}$, is defined by Fourier's law of heat conduction. With the sign convention that $q^{\\prime\\prime}$ is positive in the $+x$ direction, Fourier's law is written as:\n$$\nq^{\\prime\\prime} = -k(T)\\frac{dT}{dx}\n$$\nThe negative sign ensures that for a positive temperature gradient $\\frac{dT}{dx} > 0$, heat flows in the $-x$ direction ($q^{\\prime\\prime} < 0$), and for a negative temperature gradient $\\frac{dT}{dx} < 0$, heat flows in the $+x$ direction ($q^{\\prime\\prime} > 0$). This is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics.\n\n1) Proof of Spatially Constant Heat Flux and Derivation of an Integral Relation.\n\nFirst, we demonstrate that the heat flux $q^{\\prime\\prime}$ is constant throughout the slab. Substituting the definition of heat flux from Fourier's law into the simplified energy equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}(-q^{\\prime\\prime}) = 0\n$$\nThis directly implies that:\n$$\n\\frac{dq^{\\prime\\prime}}{dx} = 0\n$$\nIntegrating this equation with respect to $x$ shows that $q^{\\prime\\prime}$ is a constant, independent of the spatial coordinate $x$.\n\nNext, to derive the integral relation for this constant heat flux $q^{\\prime\\prime}$, we rearrange Fourier's law:\n$$\nq^{\\prime\\prime}dx = -k(T)dT\n$$\nWe integrate this expression across the entire thickness of the slab. The spatial variable $x$ is integrated from $0$ to $L$, while the temperature $T$ is integrated from the corresponding boundary temperature $T(0)=T_1$ to $T(L)=T_2$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} q^{\\prime\\prime}dx = \\int_{T_1}^{T_2} -k(T)dT\n$$\nSince $q^{\\prime\\prime}$ is constant, it can be taken outside the integral on the left side. To eliminate the negative sign on the right side, we can reverse the limits of integration.\n$$\nq^{\\prime\\prime}\\int_{0}^{L}dx = \\int_{T_2}^{T_1} k(T)dT\n$$\nEvaluating the integral on the left side gives:\n$$\nq^{\\prime\\prime}L = \\int_{T_2}^{T_1} k(T)dT\n$$\nSolving for $q^{\\prime\\prime}$, we obtain the required integral relation:\n$$\nq^{\\prime\\prime} = \\frac{1}{L}\\int_{T_2}^{T_1} k(T)dT\n$$\nThis relation expresses the heat flux solely in terms of the slab thickness $L$, the boundary temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$, and the functional form of the thermal conductivity $k(T)$.\n\n2) Closed-Form Expression for Heat Flux.\n\nWe now specialize this result for the given temperature-dependent thermal conductivity, $k(T) = k_0(1+\\alpha T)$. We substitute this expression into the integral relation:\n$$\nq^{\\prime\\prime} = \\frac{1}{L}\\int_{T_2}^{T_1} k_0(1+\\alpha T)dT\n$$\nSince $k_0$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$\nq^{\\prime\\prime} = \\frac{k_0}{L}\\int_{T_2}^{T_1} (1+\\alpha T)dT\n$$\nThe integration is straightforward:\n$$\n\\int (1+\\alpha T)dT = T + \\frac{\\alpha}{2}T^2\n$$\nApplying the limits of integration:\n$$\nq^{\\prime\\prime} = \\frac{k_0}{L}\\left[T + \\frac{\\alpha}{2}T^2\\right]_{T_2}^{T_1} = \\frac{k_0}{L}\\left(\\left(T_1 + \\frac{\\alpha}{2}T_1^2\\right) - \\left(T_2 + \\frac{\\alpha}{2}T_2^2\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThis expression can be rearranged by grouping terms:\n$$\nq^{\\prime\\prime} = \\frac{k_0}{L}\\left((T_1 - T_2) + \\frac{\\alpha}{2}(T_1^2 - T_2^2)\\right)\n$$\nFactoring the difference of squares $T_1^2 - T_2^2 = (T_1-T_2)(T_1+T_2)$, we can write the expression more compactly:\n$$\nq^{\\prime\\prime} = \\frac{k_0(T_1 - T_2)}{L}\\left(1 + \\frac{\\alpha}{2}(T_1+T_2)\\right)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the heat flux.\n\n3) Derivation of the Temperature Profile $T(x)$.\n\nTo find the explicit temperature distribution $T(x)$, we return to the separated form of Fourier's law and integrate from the boundary at $x=0$ to an arbitrary position $x$ within the slab, where the temperature is $T(x)$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{x} q^{\\prime\\prime}d\\xi = \\int_{T_1}^{T(x)} -k(T)dT\n$$\nHere, $\\xi$ is used as a dummy variable for integration over position.\n$$\nq^{\\prime\\prime}x = -\\int_{T_1}^{T(x)} k_0(1+\\alpha T)dT\n$$\n$$\nq^{\\prime\\prime}x = -k_0\\left[T + \\frac{\\alpha}{2}T^2\\right]_{T_1}^{T(x)}\n$$\n$$\nq^{\\prime\\prime}x = -k_0\\left(\\left(T(x) + \\frac{\\alpha}{2}T(x)^2\\right) - \\left(T_1 + \\frac{\\alpha}{2}T_1^2\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThis equation relates $T(x)$ to $x$.

The values provided are physically plausible. There are no internal contradictions or missing data.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived based on the principles of linear non-equilibrium thermodynamics.\n\nSolution Derivation:\nThe problem requires the calculation of the heat flux arising from a concentration gradient in an isothermal, isobaric binary mixture. This phenomenon is known as the Dufour effect. According to the principles of linear non-equilibrium thermodynamics, fluxes are linearly proportional to thermodynamic forces.\n\nIn this system, the heat flux in the $x$-direction, denoted as $J_q$, is driven by two potential forces: the gradient of temperature and the gradient of chemical potential (or concentration). The total heat flux is generally expressed as:\n$$ J_q = -k \\frac{dT}{dx} + J_{q, \\text{Dufour}} $$\nwhere the first term represents Fourier's law of heat conduction ($k$ is the thermal conductivity) and the second term is the heat flux due to the Dufour effect.\n\nThe problem states that the system is isothermal, which means the temperature $T$ is uniform. Therefore, the temperature gradient is zero:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dx} = 0 $$\nConsequently, the heat flux component due to thermal conduction is zero, and the total heat flux is solely the Dufour flux:\n$$ J_q = J_{q, \\text{Dufour}} $$\n\nThe Dufour heat flux is linearly related to the gradient of the mole fraction. The problem provides a Dufour coefficient, $D_f$, with units of $\\mathrm{W/m}$. The mole fraction gradient, $\\frac{dx_A}{dx}$, has units of $\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$. For the product to yield a heat flux (units of $\\mathrm{W/m^2}$), the phenomenological law must take the form:\n$$ J_q = -D_f \\frac{dx_A}{dx} $$\nThe negative sign is a standard convention in transport phenomena, analogous to Fourier's law and Fick's law, indicating that for a positive coefficient, the flux is directed opposite to the gradient.\n\nThe problem states that the mole fraction $x_A(x)$ varies linearly with the position $x$ over the length $L$. This implies that the gradient $\\frac{dx_A}{dx}$ is constant throughout the channel. We can calculate this gradient using the given boundary conditions:\n$$ \\frac{dx_A}{dx} = \\frac{x_A(L) - x_A(0)}{L - 0} $$\nSubstituting the given values, $L = 0.006~\\mathrm{m}$, $x_A(0) = 0.65$, and $x_A(L) = 0.50$:\n$$ \\frac{dx_A}{dx} = \\frac{0.50 - 0.65}{0.006~\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{-0.15}{0.006~\\mathrm{m}} = -25~\\mathrm{m}^{-1} $$\nThe gradient is constant and negative, indicating that the mole fraction of species $A$ decreases along the positive $x$-direction.\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat flux $J_q$ using the phenomenological law.
