The constitutive relation for diffusive flux is Fick's first law:\n$$\nJ_{x} = -D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the constant molecular diffusivity.

BC2: $C(x \\to \\infty, t) = C_{0}$ for $t > 0$\n\nThis problem lacks a characteristic length or time scale, which suggests a similarity solution exists. We introduce a single similarity variable $\\eta$ that combines the independent variables $x$ and $t$. Based on dimensional analysis, this variable must be of the form $\\eta \\propto x/\\sqrt{Dt}$. We choose the conventional form:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{4Dt}}\n$$\nTo simplify the boundary conditions, we define a dimensionless concentration, $\\theta(\\eta)$:\n$$\n\\theta(\\eta) = \\frac{C(x,t) - C_{s}}{C_{0} - C_{s}}\n$$\nThe PDE for $C(x,t)$ can now be transformed into an ODE for $\\theta(\\eta)$.

The equation becomes a first-order separable ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{d\\eta} = -2\\eta p \\implies \\frac{dp}{p} = -2\\eta d\\eta\n$$\nIntegrating gives $\\ln(p) = -\\eta^2 + K_{1}$, or $p = K_{2}\\exp(-\\eta^2)$, where $K_{2} = \\exp(K_{1})$ is a constant. Re-substituting $p = d\\theta/d\\eta$ and integrating again:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta}{d\\eta} = K_{2} \\exp(-\\eta^2) \\implies \\theta(\\eta) = K_{2} \\int_{0}^{\\eta} \\exp(-z^2) dz + K_{3}\n$$\nApplying the first boundary condition, $\\theta(0)=0$:\n$$\n0 = K_{2} \\int_{0}^{0} \\exp(-z^2) dz + K_{3} \\implies K_{3} = 0\n$$\nApplying the second boundary condition, $\\theta(\\infty)=1$:\n$$\n1 = K_{2} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-z^2) dz\n$$\nThe definite integral is the Gaussian integral, whose value is $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-z^2) dz = \\sqrt{\\pi}/2$. Thus:\n$$\n1 = K_{2} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} \\implies K_{2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\n$$\nThe solution for $\\theta(\\eta)$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\theta(\\eta) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_{0}^{\\eta} \\exp(-z^2) dz \\equiv \\text{erf}(\\eta)\n$$\nwhere $\\text{erf}(\\eta)$ is the error function.

The flux is $J(x,t) = -D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}$. First, we compute the concentration gradient:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} = (C_{0} - C_{s}) \\frac{d}{dx}\\left[\\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{4Dt}}\\right)\\right] = (C_{0} - C_{s}) \\left[\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{4Dt}\\right)\\right] \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4Dt}}\n$$\nNow, evaluate the flux $J(x,t)$ at the boundary $x=0$:\n$$\nJ(0,t) = -D \\left. \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} \\right|_{x=0} = -D (C_{0} - C_{s}) \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}\\sqrt{4Dt}} \\exp(0)\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the final result for the diffusive flux at the boundary:\n$$\nJ(0,t) = -D (C_{0} - C_{s}) \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi Dt}} = (C_{s} - C_{0}) \\frac{D}{\\sqrt{\\pi Dt}} = (C_{s} - C_{0})\\sqrt{\\frac{D}{\\pi t}}\n$$\nThis result shows that the magnitude of the flux, $|J(0,t)|$, is proportional to $|C_{s}-C_{0}|$ and $\\sqrt{D}$, as expected. The time dependence emerges from the similarity structure of the problem. Specifically, the flux decays with time as $t^{-1/2}$. This decay occurs because as time progresses, the diffusing species penetrates deeper into the medium, causing the concentration gradient at the surface $x=0$ to decrease. Since the flux is directly proportional to this gradient, the flux diminishes over time. The exponent in this temporal decay is precisely $-1/2$. At $t=0^{+}$, the model predicts an infinite flux, corresponding to the infinitely steep initial concentration gradient.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{(C_{s} - C_{0})\\sqrt{\\frac{D}{\\pi t}}}\n$$", "id": "2507726"}, {"introduction": "The intricate coupling of convection and diffusion near a surface is often simplified using conceptual models.

We look for a solution of the form $u(y,t) = \\text{Re}\\{f(y)\\exp(i\\omega t)\\}$. Substituting into the governing equation yields an ordinary differential equation for $f(y)$:\n$$\ni\\omega f(y) = \\nu \\frac{d^2f}{dy^2} \\implies \\frac{d^2f}{dy^2} - \\frac{i\\omega}{\\nu}f(y) = 0\n$$\nThe roots of the characteristic equation are $\\pm\\sqrt{i\\omega/\\nu}$.

Round your answers to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the interfacial concentration and the total molar absorption rate of a species $A$ being transferred from a gas phase to a liquid phase. This is a classic mass transfer problem that is analyzed using the two-film theory. The fundamental principle is that at steady state, the molar flux of species $A$ across the gas film, $N_{A,G}$, must equal the molar flux across the liquid film, $N_{A,L}$. We denote this common flux as $N_A$.\n\nWe perform a validation of the problem statement.\n\nStep 1: Extract Givens.\n- Isothermal temperature: $T=298\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- Total gas pressure: $P=1.01325\\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n- Bulk gas-phase mole fraction of $A$: $y_{A,b}=0.10$\n- Bulk liquid-phase concentration of $A$: $c_{A,b}=0\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n- Interfacial area: $A_{\\mathrm{int}}=12.0\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n- Liquid-side mass transfer coefficient: $k_{L}=1.20\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- Gas-side mass transfer coefficient: $k_{G}=7.50\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}$\n- Henry's Law constant: $H=2.00\\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$\n- Interfacial equilibrium relation: $p_{A,i}=H\\,c_{A,i}$\n\nStep 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens.\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, describing a standard gas absorption process governed by the two-film theory and Henry's law. It is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and a clear objective. The language is objective and precise. The physical quantities and their units are consistent. For example, the units of $k_G H$ are $(\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}) \\times (\\mathrm{Pa}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}) = \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which is dimensionally consistent with $k_L$. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe molar flux in the gas phase, $N_A$, is defined by the partial pressure difference between the bulk gas and the gas-liquid interface, multiplied by the gas-side mass transfer coefficient $k_G$:\n$$N_A = k_G (p_{A,b} - p_{A,i})$$\nThe bulk partial pressure of $A$, $p_{A,b}$, is determined from the bulk mole fraction $y_{A,b}$ and the total pressure $P$ using Dalton's Law:\n$$p_{A,b} = y_{A,b} P = 0.10 \\times (1.01325 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}) = 10132.5\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$$\n\nThe molar flux in the liquid phase, $N_A$, is defined by the concentration difference between the interface and the bulk liquid, multiplied by the liquid-side mass transfer coefficient $k_L$:\n$$N_A = k_L (c_{A,i} - c_{A,b})$$\nWe are given that the bulk liquid is initially free of $A$, so $c_{A,b} = 0\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$N_A = k_L c_{A,i}$$\n\nAt the gas-liquid interface, thermodynamic equilibrium is assumed. The interfacial partial pressure $p_{A,i}$ and the interfacial dissolved concentration $c_{A,i}$ are related by Henry's Law:\n$$p_{A,i} = H c_{A,i}$$\n\nAt steady state, the flux across both films is equal. We can equate the two expressions for $N_A$:\n$$k_G (p_{A,b} - p_{A,i}) = k_L c_{A,i}$$\nWe have a system of two equations with two unknowns, $p_{A,i}$ and $c_{A,i}$. We can substitute the Henry's Law relation for $p_{A,i}$ into the flux equality equation:\n$$k_G (p_{A,b} - H c_{A,i}) = k_L c_{A,i}$$\nThis is a single equation for the unknown interfacial concentration $c_{A,i}$. We rearrange the equation to solve for $c_{A,i}$:\n$$k_G p_{A,b} - k_G H c_{A,i} = k_L c_{A,i}$$\n$$k_G p_{A,b} = (k_L + k_G H) c_{A,i}$$\n$$c_{A,i} = \\frac{k_G p_{A,b}}{k_L + k_G H}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values to find $c_{A,i}$:\n$$p_{A,b} = 10132.5\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$$\n$$k_G = 7.50 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}$$\n$$k_L = 1.20 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n$$H = 2.00 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$$\nFirst, compute the product $k_G H$:\n$$k_G H = (7.50 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}) \\times (2.00 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}) = 150\\ \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nNow, substitute into the expression for $c_{A,i}$:\n$$c_{A,i} = \\frac{(7.50 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 10132.5}{1.20 \\times 10^{-4} + 150} = \\frac{0.07599375}{150.00012} \\approx 5.06624 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the interfacial concentration is:\n$$c_{A,i} = 5.066 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$$\n\nNext, we determine the overall molar absorption rate, $\\dot{n}_{A}$. This is the molar flux $N_A$ multiplied by the total interfacial area $A_{\\mathrm{int}}$:\n$$\\dot{n}_{A} = N_A \\times A_{\\mathrm{int}}$$\nWe can calculate the flux $N_A$ using the liquid-side expression, which is simpler:\n$$N_A = k_L c_{A,i}$$\nUsing the unrounded value for $c_{A,i}$ for better precision:\n$$N_A = (1.20 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (5.06624 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}) \\approx 6.07949 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nNow, we calculate the total rate $\\dot{n}_{A}$:\n$$\\dot{n}_{A} = (6.07949 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (12.0\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}) \\approx 7.29539 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the overall molar absorption rate is:\n$$\\dot{n}_{A} = 7.295 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe problem is solved. The liquid-side resistance, proportional to $1/k_L \\approx 8333\\ \\mathrm{s}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$, is much larger than the gas-side resistance, proportional to $1/(Hk_G) = 1/150 \\approx 0.0067\\ \\mathrm{s}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$. The process is strongly controlled by the liquid film resistance. This is consistent with the result that the interfacial concentration $c_{A,i}$ is very close to the concentration that would be in equilibrium with the bulk gas, $c_{A,b}^* = p_{A,b}/H \\approx 5.066 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 5.066 \\times 10^{-4} & 7.295 \\times 10^{-7} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2507711"}]}
