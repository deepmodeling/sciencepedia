This will be done for both a black surface and a gray, diffuse surface.\n\nFirst, we must derive the expression for the total hemispherical emissive power of a blackbody, $E_{b}(T)$, starting from the provided Planck's distribution for the spectral directional intensity of blackbody radiation, $I_{\\lambda,b}(T)$.\nThe spectral directional intensity is given as:\n$$\nI_{\\lambda,b}(T) = \\frac{2 h c^{2}}{\\lambda^{5}} \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{h c}{\\lambda k_{B} T}\\right)-1}\n$$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $\\lambda$ is the wavelength, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe spectral hemispherical emissive power, $E_{\\lambda,b}(T)$, is the rate of radiant energy emitted per unit area per unit wavelength interval into the hemisphere above the surface. It is obtained by integrating the spectral directional intensity over the solid angle of the hemisphere. For a diffuse surface (which a blackbody is), the intensity $I_{\\lambda,b}$ is uniform in all directions. According to Lambert's cosine law, the emitted power in a given direction is proportional to the cosine of the angle $\\theta$ from the surface normal.\n$$\nE_{\\lambda,b}(T) = \\int_{\\Omega} I_{\\lambda,b}(T) \\cos\\theta \\, d\\Omega\n$$\nThe differential solid angle in spherical coordinates is $d\\Omega = \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi$, where $\\theta$ is the zenith angle and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle.

A full derivation will be provided.\n\nThe net outward radiative power $P$ from the aperture is the difference between the power radiated outward, $P_{out}$, and the power absorbed from the exterior, $P_{in}$. The aperture is stated to be perfectly black, so its absorptivity is unity, and all incident radiation is absorbed.\n$$P = P_{out} - P_{in}$$\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the outward power, $P_{out}$. The aperture radiates as a blackbody at the temperature $T$ of the cavity. The Planck spectral radiance, $B_{\\lambda}(T)$, gives the power emitted per unit projected area, per unit solid angle, per unit wavelength. Assuming the standard physics definition for this term, it is the spectral intensity $I_{\\lambda,b}(T)$:\n$$I_{\\lambda,b}(T) = \\frac{2 h c^2}{\\lambda^5 \\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{h c}{\\lambda k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right)}$$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength.\n\nThe power per unit area per unit wavelength, known as the spectral hemispherical emissive power $E_{\\lambda,b}(T)$, is found by integrating the radiance over the entire hemisphere of outward directions.

For any physically meaningful situation, $\\lambda_0  0$ and $T_0  0$, so the parameter $x$ is always positive, $x0$. It is a fundamental mathematical inequality that for any $x0$, $\\exp(x)  1+x$. This implies $\\exp(x) - 1  x$. Consequently, the denominator $\\exp(x) - 1$ is strictly greater than the numerator $x$. Therefore, for any $x0$:\n$$ \\frac{x}{\\exp(x) - 1}  1 \\implies \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{RJ}}}{T_0}  1 \\implies T_{\\mathrm{RJ}}  T_0 $$\nThis shows that the inferred temperature $T_{\\mathrm{RJ}}$ is always less than the true temperature $T_0$. The use of the classical limit, which is only valid for $x \\ll 1$, introduces a systematic negative bias (underestimation) in the temperature reading whenever it is applied in a regime where $x$ is not infinitesimally small. The Rayleigh-Jeans law overestimates the radiance for a given temperature; thus, to match the lower true Planckian radiance, the pyrometer must calculate a lower temperature.\n\nNow, we compute the fractional bias, $\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{RJ}} - T_0}{T_0}$, for the given values. The fractional bias is equivalent to $\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{RJ}}}{T_0} - 1$.\n$$ \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{RJ}} - T_0}{T_0} = \\frac{x}{\\exp(x) - 1} - 1 $$\nFirst, we must calculate the value of $x$ using the given constants: $h = 6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s}$, $c = 2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}$, and the specified parameters $\\lambda_0 = 4.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and $T_0 = 800.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n$$ x = \\frac{h c}{\\lambda_0 k_B T_0} = \\frac{(6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s}) (2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{m/s})}{(4.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}) (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}) (800.0\\,\\mathrm{K})} $$\nLet's compute the numerator and denominator separately.\n$$ h c \\approx 1.98644586 \\times 10^{-25}\\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot m} $$\n$$ \\lambda_0 k_B T_0 = (4.00 \\times 10^{-6}) (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}) (800.0) \\approx 4.4180768 \\times 10^{-26}\\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot m} $$\n$$ x = \\frac{1.98644586 \\times 10^{-25}}{4.4180768 \\times 10^{-26}} \\approx 4.49658145 $$\nThe condition for the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation, $x \\ll 1$, is grossly violated, as $x \\approx 4.50$. We now substitute this value into the expression for the fractional bias:\n$$ \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{RJ}} - T_0}{T_0} = \\frac{4.49658145}{\\exp(4.49658145) - 1} - 1 $$\n$$ \\exp(4.49658145) \\approx 89.702755 $$\n$$ \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{RJ}} - T_0}{T_0} \\approx \\frac{4.49658145}{89.702755 - 1} - 1 = \\frac{4.49658145}{88.702755} - 1 \\approx 0.05069274 - 1 = -0.94930726 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the fractional bias is $-0.9493$.
