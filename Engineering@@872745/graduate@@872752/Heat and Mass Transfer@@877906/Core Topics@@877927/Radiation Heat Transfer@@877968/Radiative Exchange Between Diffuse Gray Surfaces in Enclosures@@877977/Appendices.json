It presents a classical problem in the theory of radiative heat transfer and requests a derivation from first principles, which is a valid and fundamental exercise. No flaws are identified. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe view factor, or configuration factor, $F_{ij}$ from a surface $A_i$ to a surface $A_j$ is defined by the integral relation:\n$$ F_{ij} = \\frac{1}{A_i} \\int_{A_i} \\int_{A_j} \\frac{\\cos\\theta_i \\cos\\theta_j}{\\pi R^2} dA_j dA_i $$\nwhere $dA_i$ and $dA_j$ are differential area elements on surfaces $i$ and $j$ respectively, $R$ is the magnitude of the vector connecting these elements, and $\\theta_i$ and $\\theta_j$ are the angles between this connecting vector and the respective surface normals.\n\nWe are given two parallel, infinite planar surfaces. Let surface $1$ be the plane $z=0$ and surface $2$ be the plane $z=H$, where $H0$. The outward unit normal for surface $1$ is $\\mathbf{n}_1 = (0, 0, 1)$ and for surface $2$ is $\\mathbf{n}_2 = (0, 0, -1)$.\n\nLet us first derive the view factor $F_{12}$. We select a differential area element $dA_1$ on surface $1$ at location $\\mathbf{r}_1 = (x_1, y_1, 0)$ and a differential area element $dA_2$ on surface $2$ at location $\\mathbf{r}_2 = (x_2, y_2, H)$. The vector $\\mathbf{R}$ from $dA_1$ to $dA_2$ is given by:\n$$ \\mathbf{R} = \\mathbf{r}_2 - \\mathbf{r}_1 = (x_2-x_1)\\mathbf{\\hat{i}} + (y_2-y_1)\\mathbf{\\hat{j}} + H\\mathbf{\\hat{k}} $$\nThe squared magnitude of this vector is:\n$$ R^2 = (x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2 + H^2 $$\nThe angles $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ are found from the dot product with the respective normal vectors.\n$$ \\cos\\theta_1 = \\frac{\\mathbf{R} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_1}{R} = \\frac{H}{R} $$\n$$ \\cos\\theta_2 = \\frac{-\\mathbf{R} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_2}{R} = \\frac{-(-H)}{R} = \\frac{H}{R} $$\nThe term $-\\mathbf{R}$ is used for the second cosine because the vector from $dA_2$ to $dA_1$ is $-\\mathbf{R}$, and the angle definition is symmetric. Equivalently, and more directly, $\\theta_2$ is the angle between the vector from $1$ to $2$ ($\\mathbf{R}$) and the normal of surface $2$ ($\\mathbf{n}_2$), but we must take the component of $\\mathbf{R}$ along $\\mathbf{n}_2$ as pointing away from the surface, which is standard. For parallel plates, both angles are identical.\n\nSubstituting these into the view factor integral for $F_{12}$:\n$$ F_{12} = \\frac{1}{A_1} \\int_{A_1} \\left( \\int_{A_2} \\frac{(H/R)(H/R)}{\\pi R^2} dA_2 \\right) dA_1 = \\frac{1}{A_1} \\int_{A_1} \\left( \\int_{A_2} \\frac{H^2}{\\pi R^4} dA_2 \\right) dA_1 $$\nThe inner integral represents the view factor from a differential element $dA_1$ to the finite surface $A_2$, denoted $F_{dA_1 \\to A_2}$.\n$$ F_{dA_1 \\to A_2} = \\int_{A_2} \\frac{H^2}{\\pi R^4} dA_2 = \\int_{A_2} \\frac{H^2}{\\pi \\left( (x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2 + H^2 \\right)^2} dx_2 dy_2 $$\nDue to the infinite extent of both planes, the geometry is translationally invariant. The value of this inner integral is independent of the location $(x_1, y_1)$ of $dA_1$. We can therefore, without loss of generality, place $dA_1$ at the origin $(0, 0, 0)$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$ F_{dA_1 \\to A_2} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{H^2}{\\pi (x_2^2 + y_2^2 + H^2)^2} dx_2 dy_2 $$\nTo solve this integral, we switch to a polar coordinate system on the plane $z=H$, centered at $(0, 0, H)$. Let $x_2 = r\\cos\\phi$ and $y_2 = r\\sin\\phi$. The differential area element becomes $dA_2 = r dr d\\phi$. The integration limits are $r \\in [0, \\infty)$ and $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\n$$ F_{dA_1 \\to A_2} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{H^2}{\\pi (r^2 + H^2)^2} r dr d\\phi $$\nSince the integrand is independent of $\\phi$, the integration over $\\phi$ yields a factor of $2\\pi$.\n$$ F_{dA_1 \\to A_2} = \\frac{2\\pi H^2}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{r}{(r^2 + H^2)^2} dr = 2H^2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{r}{(r^2 + H^2)^2} dr $$\nWe perform a substitution. Let $u = r^2 + H^2$. Then $du = 2r dr$, or $r dr = du/2$. The limits of integration change from $r=0 \\implies u=H^2$ to $r \\to \\infty \\implies u \\to \\infty$.\n$$ F_{dA_1 \\to A_2} = 2H^2 \\int_{H^2}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{u^2} \\frac{du}{2} = H^2 \\left[ -\\frac{1}{u} \\right]_{H^2}^{\\infty} = H^2 \\left( \\lim_{u\\to\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{1}{u}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{H^2}\\right) \\right) = H^2 \\left( 0 + \\frac{1}{H^2} \\right) = 1 $$\nSo, the view factor from any differential element on surface $1$ to the entire surface $2$ is $1$. The total view factor $F_{12}$ is the area-average of this value:\n$$ F_{12} = \\frac{1}{A_1} \\int_{A_1} F_{dA_1 \\to A_2} dA_1 = \\frac{1}{A_1} \\int_{A_1} 1 \\cdot dA_1 = \\frac{A_1}{A_1} = 1 $$\nThis is physically correct: all diffuse radiation emitted from the infinite plane $1$ into the positive hemisphere must intercept the infinite plane $2$.\n\nNext, we evaluate $F_{11}$. This factor represents the fraction of radiation leaving surface $1$ that strikes itself. Since surface $1$ is a plane, it is not possible for any point on the surface to \"see\" any other point on the same surface. The line segment connecting any two distinct points on a plane lies within that plane. The angle $\\theta_1$ between the surface normal $\\mathbf{n}_1$ (which is perpendicular to the plane) and this connecting line is therefore always $\\pi/2$.\nConsequently, $\\cos\\theta_1 = \\cos(\\pi/2) = 0$ for any pair of elements on surface $1$. The integrand in the defining equation for $F_{11}$ is zero everywhere.\n$$ F_{11} = \\frac{1}{A_1} \\int_{A_1} \\int_{A_1} \\frac{\\cos\\theta_1 \\cos\\theta'_1}{\\pi R^2} dA'_1 dA_1 = 0 $$\nThis property holds for any planar or convex surface.\n\nFinally, we evaluate $F_{22}$. The geometric argument for $F_{11}$ applies identically to surface $2$. It is also an infinite plane, and thus it cannot see itself. Therefore,\n$$ F_{22} = 0 $$\n\nWe have derived the required view factors from first principles as $F_{12}=1$, $F_{11}=0$, and $F_{22}=0$.

A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe analysis of radiative exchange in an enclosure of diffuse, gray surfaces is founded upon the concepts of radiosity and irradiation.\nThe radiosity $J_i$ of a surface $i$ is the total radiant energy leaving the surface per unit area, comprising emitted and reflected radiation:\n$$J_i = \\varepsilon_i E_{b,i} + \\rho_i G_i$$\nFor an opaque surface, reflectivity $\\rho_i = 1 - \\alpha_i$. For a gray surface, absorptivity $\\alpha_i = \\varepsilon_i$. Thus, $\\rho_i = 1 - \\varepsilon_i$.\n$$J_i = \\varepsilon_i E_{b,i} + (1 - \\varepsilon_i) G_i$$\nThe irradiation $G_i$ on a surface $i$ is the total radiant energy incident on the surface per unit area, originating from all surfaces in the enclosure:\n$$G_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} F_{ij} J_j$$\nThe governing equations for the radiosities of the three surfaces are:\n1. $J_1 = \\varepsilon_1 E_{b,1} + (1 - \\varepsilon_1) (F_{11}J_1 + F_{12}J_2 + F_{13}J_3)$\n2. $J_2 = \\varepsilon_2 E_{b,2} + (1 - \\varepsilon_2) (F_{21}J_1 + F_{22}J_2 + F_{23}J_3)$\n3. $J_3 = \\varepsilon_3 E_{b,3} + (1 - \\varepsilon_3) (F_{31}J_1 + F_{32}J_2 + F_{33}J_3)$\n\nA critical simplification arises from the fact that surface $3$ is a blackbody, meaning its emissivity $\\varepsilon_3 = 1$. Substituting this into the equation for $J_3$:\n$$J_3 = (1) E_{b,3} + (1 - 1) G_3 = E_{b,3}$$\nThis demonstrates that the radiosity of a black surface is equal to its blackbody emissive power. Since $T_3$ is known, $J_3$ is not an unknown variable but a known constant. The system of three unknowns $(J_1, J_2, J_3)$ reduces to a system of two unknowns $(J_1, J_2)$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the blackbody emissive powers:\n$E_{b,1} = \\sigma T_1^4 = (5.670374419\\times 10^{-8}) (800)^4 \\approx 23224.3\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2}$\n$E_{b,2} = \\sigma T_2^4 = (5.670374419\\times 10^{-8}) (500)^4 \\approx 3544.0\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2}$\n$J_3 = E_{b,3} = \\sigma T_3^4 = (5.670374419\\times 10^{-8}) (300)^4 \\approx 459.3\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2}$\n\nNow, we formulate the reduced system of two linear equations for $J_1$ and $J_2$ using the given view factors and properties:\nFor surface 1 ($F_{11}=0, F_{12}=0.5, F_{13}=0.5, \\varepsilon_1=0.6$):\n$$J_1 = \\varepsilon_1 E_{b,1} + (1 - \\varepsilon_1) (F_{12}J_2 + F_{13}J_3)$$\n$$J_1 = (0.6)(23224.3) + (0.4) (0.5 J_2 + 0.5 \\times 459.3)$$\n$$J_1 = 13934.6 + 0.2 J_2 + 91.86$$\n$$J_1 - 0.2 J_2 = 14026.46 \\quad (I)$$\n\nFor surface 2 ($F_{21}=0.5, F_{22}=0, F_{23}=0.5, \\varepsilon_2=0.8$):\n$$J_2 = \\varepsilon_2 E_{b,2} + (1 - \\varepsilon_2) (F_{21}J_1 + F_{23}J_3)$$\n$$J_2 = (0.8)(3544.0) + (0.2) (0.5 J_1 + 0.5 \\times 459.3)$$\n$$J_2 = 2835.2 + 0.1 J_1 + 45.93$$\n$$-0.1 J_1 + J_2 = 2881.13 \\quad (II)$$\n\nWe solve this system. From $(II)$, $J_2 = 2881.13 + 0.1 J_1$.

First, we calculate the irradiation $G_1$:\n$$G_1 = F_{12}J_2 + F_{13}J_3 = (0.5)(4371.2) + (0.5)(459.3) = 2185.6 + 229.65 = 2415.25\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2}$$\nNow, calculate $Q_1$:\n$$Q_1 = A_1 (J_1 - G_1) = (2\\,\\mathrm{m}^2) (14900.7 - 2415.25)\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2} = 2 \\times 12485.45\\,\\mathrm{W} = 24970.9\\,\\mathrm{W}$$\nThis can be expressed as $Q_1 \\approx 2.50 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{W}$.\nSince $Q_1  0$, the net heat transfer is *away from*, or *leaving*, surface $1$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA.

It is a standard, well-defined problem in radiative heat transfer. The solution will be derived from first principles.\n\n### Derivation\n\nThe analysis is performed for a two-surface enclosure consisting of surfaces $1$ (inner cylinder) and $2$ (outer cylinder). All calculations are per unit length of the cylinders. Let a prime denote a quantity per unit length, e.g., $A'$.\n\n**(i) Self-View Factor $F_{22}$**\n\nThe view factor $F_{ij}$ is the fraction of radiation leaving surface $i$ that strikes surface $j$ directly. The self-view factor $F_{ii}$ is non-zero only if surface $i$ is concave, allowing it to \"see\" itself.\n\n-   Surface $1$ (inner cylinder) is convex. No radiation leaving its surface can strike itself. Therefore, its self-view factor is zero: $F_{11} = 0$.\n-   For any surface $i$ in an $N$-surface enclosure, the summation rule states that $\\sum_{j=1}^{N} F_{ij} = 1$. For surface $1$, this gives $F_{11} + F_{12} = 1$. Since $F_{11} = 0$, it follows that $F_{12} = 1$. All radiation leaving the inner cylinder must strike the outer cylinder.\n-   Surface $2$ (inner surface of the outer cylinder) is concave. It can see itself. Thus, $F_{22}  0$. The summation rule for surface $2$ is $F_{21} + F_{22} = 1$.\n-   To find $F_{22}$, we first need $F_{21}$. We use the reciprocity rule: $A_1 F_{12} = A_2 F_{21}$.\n-   Substituting the known values (per unit length): $A'_1 F_{12} = A'_2 F_{21}$.\n-   Since $F_{12}=1$, we have $A'_1 (1) = A'_2 F_{21}$, which gives $F_{21} = \\frac{A'_1}{A'_2} = \\frac{2\\pi R_1}{2\\pi R_2} = \\frac{R_1}{R_2}$.\n-   Using the given values, $F_{21} = \\frac{0.6}{1.0} = 0.6$. The problem gives $A'_1 = 1.2\\pi$ and $A'_2 = 2.0\\pi$, so the ratio is also $\\frac{1.2\\pi}{2.0\\pi} = 0.6$.\n-   Now, from the summation rule for surface $2$, we find $F_{22} = 1 - F_{21} = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4$.\n\nThe physical interpretation of $F_{22}$ is the fraction of diffuse radiant energy leaving the concave inner surface of the outer cylinder that directly strikes another part of that same surface. Its value for this geometry is $F_{22}=1 - R_1/R_2 = 0.4$.\n\n**(ii) Radiosity Relation for Surface 2**\n\nFor a diffuse, gray surface $i$, the radiosity $J_i$ (total outgoing radiative flux) is the sum of its emitted and reflected radiation:\n$$J_i = E_i + \\rho_i G_i$$\nwhere $E_i = \\varepsilon_i \\sigma T_i^4$ is the emissive power, $\\rho_i = 1 - \\alpha_i = 1 - \\varepsilon_i$ is the reflectivity (for a gray, opaque surface), and $G_i$ is the irradiation (incoming radiative flux).\n\nThe irradiation on surface $i$ is the sum of radiosities from all surfaces in the enclosure, weighted by the corresponding view factors:\n$$G_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} F_{ij} J_j$$\nSubstituting these into the radiosity definition:\n$$J_i = \\varepsilon_i \\sigma T_i^4 + (1 - \\varepsilon_i) \\sum_{j=1}^{N} F_{ij} J_j$$\nFor surface $2$ in our two-surface enclosure, this becomes:\n$$J_2 = \\varepsilon_2 \\sigma T_2^4 + (1 - \\varepsilon_2) (F_{21} J_1 + F_{22} J_2)$$\nThis is the radiosity relation for surface $2$. To arrange it as requested, we collect terms involving the unknown $J_2$ on the left-hand side:\n$$J_2 - (1 - \\varepsilon_2) F_{22} J_2 = \\varepsilon_2 \\sigma T_2^4 + (1 - \\varepsilon_2) F_{21} J_1$$\n$$\\big(1 - (1 - \\varepsilon_2) F_{22}\\big) J_2 = \\varepsilon_2 \\sigma T_2^4 + (1 - \\varepsilon_2) F_{21} J_1$$\nThis is the correctly posed relation. The coefficient of $J_2$ is $(1 - (1-\\varepsilon_2)F_{22})$. With $\\varepsilon_2 = 0.4$ and $F_{22} = 0.4$, this coefficient is $1 - (1 - 0.4)(0.4) = 1 - (0.6)(0.4) = 1 - 0.24 = 0.76$.\n\n**(iii) Net Radiative Heat Transfer, $\\dot{Q}'_{1\\to 2}$**\n\nThe net radiative heat transfer for a two-surface enclosure consisting of a small convex object (1) inside a large concave one (2) can be calculated using the formula:\n$$\\dot{Q}_{1\\to 2} = \\frac{\\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)}{\\frac{1-\\varepsilon_1}{A_1 \\varepsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{A_1} + \\frac{1-\\varepsilon_2}{A_2 \\varepsilon_2}}$$\nThis formula is derived from a thermal resistance network and applies when $F_{12}=1$, which is our case. Per unit length, the equation becomes:\n$$\\dot{Q}'_{1\\to 2} = \\frac{A'_1 \\sigma (T_1^4 - T_2^4)}{\\frac{1-\\varepsilon_1}{\\varepsilon_1} + 1 + \\frac{A'_1}{A'_2}\\frac{1-\\varepsilon_2}{\\varepsilon_2}}$$\nA more general expression, which is equivalent, is:\n$$\\dot{Q}'_{1\\to 2} = \\frac{A'_1 \\sigma (T_1^4 - T_2^4)}{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_1} + \\frac{A'_1}{A'_2}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_2} - 1\\right)}$$\nUsing this second formula with the given values:\n-   $A'_1 = 1.2\\pi\\ \\mathrm{m^2/m}$\n-   $A'_2 = 2\\pi\\ \\mathrm{m^2/m}$\n-   $\\frac{A'_1}{A'_2} = 0.6$\n-   $\\varepsilon_1 = 0.7$\n-   $\\varepsilon_2 = 0.4$\n-   $T_1 = 1200\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n-   $T_2 = 800\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n-   $\\sigma = 5.67 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{W/(m^2 K^4)}$\n\nThe numerator is:\n$$A'_1 \\sigma (T_1^4 - T_2^4) = (1.2\\pi) (5.67 \\times 10^{-8}) (1200^4 - 800^4)$$\n$$= (1.2\\pi) (5.67 \\times 10^{-8}) (2.0736 \\times 10^{12} - 0.4096 \\times 10^{12})$$\n$$= (1.2\\pi) (5.67 \\times 10^{-8}) (1.664 \\times 10^{12}) = (1.2\\pi)(94348.8) \\approx 355676\\ \\mathrm{W/m}$$\n\nThe denominator is:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_1} + \\frac{A'_1}{A'_2}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_2} - 1\\right) = \\frac{1}{0.7} + 0.6 \\left(\\frac{1}{0.4} - 1\\right)$$\n$$= \\frac{1}{0.7} + 0.6 (2.5 - 1) = \\frac{1}{0.7} + 0.6(1.5) \\approx 1.42857 + 0.9 = 2.32857$$\n\nThe net heat transfer per unit length is:\n$$\\dot{Q}'_{1\\to 2} = \\frac{355676}{2.32857} \\approx 152742\\ \\mathrm{W/m} \\approx 1.53 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{W/m}$$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.**\n-   (i) **$F_{22}$ interpretation and value:** \"fraction of diffuse radiant energy leaving the concave inner side of the outer cylinder that directly strikes another part of that same surface... $F_{22} = 1 - A_1/A_2 = 0.4$\". This is physically correct, and the derivation and value are correct as shown above.\n-   (ii) **Radiosity relation:** \"$\\big(1 - (1-\\varepsilon_2) F_{22}\\big) J_2 = \\varepsilon_2 \\sigma T_2^4 + (1-\\varepsilon_2) F_{21} J_1$\". This matches the derived equation precisely. \"the left-hand coefficient is $0.76$\". This matches our calculation of $1-(0.6)(0.4) = 0.76$.\n-   (iii) **Heat transfer:** \"$\\dot{Q}'_{1\\to 2} \\approx 1.53\\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{W/m}$\". This matches our calculated value.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**. All parts are self-consistent and derived correctly from first principles.\n\n**B.**\n-   (i) **$F_{22}$ interpretation and value:** \"By definition $F_{ii} = 0$ for any finite surface, so $F_{22} = 0$\". This premise is fundamentally incorrect. $F_{ii}$ is non-zero for any concave surface.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The foundation of this option is a scientific error.\n\n**C.**\n-   (i) **$F_{22}$ interpretation and value:** \"$F_{22} ...$ equals $A_1/A_2 = 0.6$\". This is incorrect. It confuses $F_{22}$ with $F_{21}$. Our derivation shows $F_{22} = 1 - A_1/A_2 = 0.4$.\n-   (ii) **Radiosity relation:** \"$\\big(1 - \\varepsilon_2 F_{22}\\big) J_2 = ...$\". This equation is incorrectly formulated. The term moved to the left-hand side should be $(1-\\varepsilon_2)F_{22}J_2$, not $\\varepsilon_2 F_{22} J_2$.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. It contains multiple errors in the application of fundamental principles.\n\n**D.**\n-   (i) **$F_{22}$ interpretation and value:** \"$F_{22}$... equals $1 - A_1/A_2 = 0.4$\". The value and formula are correct. The interpretation as \"fraction of surface 2 that is hidden from surface 1\" is an unorthodox but valid way of describing the geometry that leads to self-viewing.\n-   (ii) **Radiosity relation:** \"$\\big(1 - F_{22}\\big) J_2 = ...$\". This equation is incorrectly formulated. It is missing the reflectivity term $(1-\\varepsilon_2)$. The correct coefficient for $J_2$ on the LHS is $(1 - (1-\\varepsilon_2)F_{22})$, not $(1-F_{22})$.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. Although the view factor value is correct, the radiosity equation is physically wrong.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2519272"}]}
