It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in the field of heat transfer, specifically concerning steady-state, one-dimensional heat conduction through a composite cylinder. All necessary parameters and boundary conditions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions, ambiguities, or physical impossibilities. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts. First, we derive the fundamental relationship for heat transfer through a single cylindrical layer. Second, we analyze the composite cylinder with perfect thermal contact. Third, we incorporate a thermal contact resistance and evaluate its impact.\n\nPart 1: Derivation for a Single Homogeneous Cylindrical Layer\n\nThe governing equation for steady-state, one-dimensional (radial) heat conduction with no heat generation in cylindrical coordinates is derived from the general heat diffusion equation. Under these conditions, the equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r k \\frac{dT}{dr}\\right) = 0 $$\nFor a material with constant thermal conductivity $k$, this becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r \\frac{dT}{dr}\\right) = 0 $$\nIntegrating this equation once with respect to the radial coordinate $r$ yields:\n$$ r \\frac{dT}{dr} = C_{1} $$\nwhere $C_{1}$ is a constant of integration. We can separate variables and integrate a second time:\n$$ \\int dT = \\int \\frac{C_{1}}{r} dr $$\nThis gives the general solution for the temperature field $T(r)$:\n$$ T(r) = C_{1} \\ln(r) + C_{2} $$\nwhere $C_{2}$ is the second integration constant.\n\nThe radial heat rate, $q_{r}$, is given by Fourier's law of conduction:\n$$ q_{r} = -k A_{r} \\frac{dT}{dr} $$\nwhere the area normal to heat flow is $A_{r} = 2\\pi r L$. Substituting the expression for the temperature gradient, $\\frac{dT}{dr} = \\frac{C_{1}}{r}$:\n$$ q_{r} = -k (2\\pi r L) \\left(\\frac{C_{1}}{r}\\right) = -2\\pi k L C_{1} $$\nSince $k$ and $L$ are constants, the heat rate $q_{r}$ must be a constant, independent of radius, which we denote as $q$. This is a direct consequence of the steady-state energy balance with no internal generation. We can express the constant $C_{1}$ in terms of the heat rate $q$:\n$$ C_{1} = -\\frac{q}{2\\pi k L} $$\nNow consider a single cylindrical layer between an inner radius $r_{i}$ and an outer radius $r_{o}$, with corresponding temperatures $T_{i}$ and $T_{o}$. We apply these boundary conditions to the general solution for $T(r)$:\n$$ T_{i} = T(r_{i}) = C_{1} \\ln(r_{i}) + C_{2} $$\n$$ T_{o} = T(r_{o}) = C_{1} \\ln(r_{o}) + C_{2} $$\nSubtracting the second equation from the first to eliminate $C_{2}$:\n$$ T_{i} - T_{o} = C_{1} (\\ln(r_{i}) - \\ln(r_{o})) = C_{1} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{i}}{r_{o}}\\right) = -C_{1} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{o}}{r_{i}}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{1}$:\n$$ T_{i} - T_{o} = -\\left(-\\frac{q}{2\\pi k L}\\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{o}}{r_{i}}\\right) = \\frac{q}{2\\pi k L} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{o}}{r_{i}}\\right) $$\nThis equation relates the temperature drop across the layer to the heat rate. It can be rearranged to express the heat rate as a function of the temperature drop and the system's properties, analogous to Ohm's law:\n$$ q = \\frac{T_{i} - T_{o}}{R_{th}} $$\nwhere the thermal resistance of the hollow cylindrical layer, $R_{th}$, is defined as:\n$$ R_{th} = \\frac{\\ln(r_{o}/r_{i})}{2\\pi k L} $$\nThis completes the required derivation.\n\nPart 2: Analysis without Contact Resistance\n\nFor the three-layer composite cylinder with perfect thermal contact, the total heat transfer rate $q_{no\\_c}$ is constant through each layer. The system can be modeled as three thermal resistances in series. The resistances of the three layers are:\n$$ R_{1} = \\frac{\\ln(r_{2}/r_{1})}{2\\pi k_{1} L} $$\n$$ R_{2} = \\frac{\\ln(r_{3}/r_{2})}{2\\pi k_{2} L} $$\n$$ R_{3} = \\frac{\\ln(r_{4}/r_{3})}{2\\pi k_{3} L} $$\nThe total thermal resistance, $R_{tot}$, is the sum of the individual resistances:\n$$ R_{tot} = R_{1} + R_{2} + R_{3} $$\nThe total heat rate is then:\n$$ q_{no\\_c} = \\frac{T_{1} - T_{4}}{R_{tot}} $$\nUsing the provided data:\n$L = 0.75 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $r_{1} = 0.05 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $r_{2} = 0.065 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $r_{3} = 0.085 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $r_{4} = 0.110 \\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n$k_{1} = 15 \\ \\mathrm{W \\cdot m^{-1} \\cdot K^{-1}}$, $k_{2} = 0.30 \\ \\mathrm{W \\cdot m^{-1} \\cdot K^{-1}}$, $k_{3} = 1.20 \\ \\mathrm{W \\cdot m^{-1} \\cdot K^{-1}}$.\n$T_{1} = 475 \\ \\mathrm{K}$, $T_{4} = 300 \\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n\nWe compute the resistances:\n$$ R_{1} = \\frac{\\ln(0.065/0.05)}{2\\pi (15)(0.75)} = \\frac{\\ln(1.3)}{22.5\\pi} \\approx 0.0037119 \\ \\mathrm{K \\cdot W^{-1}} $$\n$$ R_{2} = \\frac{\\ln(0.085/0.065)}{2\\pi (0.30)(0.75)} = \\frac{\\ln(1.30769...)}{0.45\\pi} \\approx 0.189730 \\ \\mathrm{K \\cdot W^{-1}} $$\n$$ R_{3} = \\frac{\\ln(0.110/0.085)}{2\\pi (1.20)(0.75)} = \\frac{\\ln(1.29411...)}{1.8\\pi} \\approx 0.0455943 \\ \\mathrm{K \\cdot W^{-1}} $$\nThe total resistance is:\n$$ R_{tot} = 0.0037119 + 0.189730 + 0.0455943 \\approx 0.239036 \\ \\mathrm{K \\cdot W^{-1}} $$\nThe total heat rate is:\n$$ q_{no\\_c} = \\frac{475 - 300}{0.239036} = \\frac{175}{0.239036} \\approx 732.11 \\ \\mathrm{W} $$\nThe interfacial temperatures $T_{2}$ (at $r=r_{2}$) and $T_{3}$ (at $r=r_{3}$) are found using the heat rate:\n$$ q_{no\\_c} = \\frac{T_{1} - T_{2}}{R_{1}} \\implies T_{2} = T_{1} - q_{no\\_c}R_{1} $$\n$$ T_{2} = 475 - (732.11)(0.0037119) \\approx 475 - 2.718 = 472.28 \\ \\mathrm{K} $$\n$$ q_{no\\_c} = \\frac{T_{2} - T_{3}}{R_{2}} \\implies T_{3} = T_{2} - q_{no\\_c}R_{2} $$\n$$ T_{3} = 472.28 - (732.11)(0.189730) \\approx 472.28 - 138.90 = 333.38 \\ \\mathrm{K} $$\n\nPart 3: Analysis with Contact Resistance\n\nA thermal contact resistance, $R_{c}$, is introduced at the interface $r=r_{3}$. This resistance is related to the area-specific contact resistance $R_{c}''$ by $R_{c} = R_{c}''/A_{3}$, where $A_{3} = 2\\pi r_{3} L$.\nGiven $R_{c}'' = 1.80 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m^2 \\cdot K \\cdot W^{-1}}$:\n$$ A_{3} = 2\\pi (0.085)(0.75) = 0.1275\\pi \\approx 0.400553 \\ \\mathrm{m}^{2} $$\n$$ R_{c} = \\frac{1.80 \\times 10^{-4}}{0.400553} \\approx 0.00044938 \\ \\mathrm{K \\cdot W^{-1}} $$\nThis contact resistance is added in series to the network. The new total resistance, $R'_{tot}$, is:\n$$ R'_{tot} = R_{1} + R_{2} + R_{c} + R_{3} = 0.239036 + 0.00044938 = 0.239485 \\ \\mathrm{K \\cdot W^{-1}} $$\nThe new heat rate, $q_{c}$, is:\n$$ q_{c} = \\frac{T_{1} - T_{4}}{R'_{tot}} = \\frac{475 - 300}{0.239485} \\approx 730.73 \\ \\mathrm{W} $$\nThe new interfacial temperatures are calculated. Let $T'_{3-}$ and $T'_{3+}$ be the temperatures on the inner and outer sides of the interface at $r=r_{3}$, respectively.\n$$ T'_{2} = T_{1} - q_{c}R_{1} = 475 - (730.73)(0.0037119) \\approx 475 - 2.713 = 472.29 \\ \\mathrm{K} $$\n$$ T'_{3-} = T'_{2} - q_{c}R_{2} = 472.29 - (730.73)(0.189730) \\approx 472.29 - 138.64 = 333.65 \\ \\mathrm{K} $$\nThe temperature drop across the contact resistance is $\\Delta T_{c} = q_{c}R_{c} = T'_{3-} - T'_{3+}$.\n$$ \\Delta T_{c} = (730.73)(0.00044938) \\approx 0.328 \\ \\mathrm{K} $$\nThus, $T'_{3+} = 333.65 - 0.328 = 333.32 \\ \\mathrm{K}$.

This problem delves into the practical strategy of applying a surface coating to enhance thermal contact, highlighting the critical interplay between mechanical and thermal properties.

In Trial C (coated), one solid is coated with a sufficiently thick metallic layer (thickness $t$ such that $t \\gg a$, where $a$ is a typical microcontact radius), of thermal conductivity $k_c$ and indentation hardness $H_c$, and is pressed against the uncoated base metal counterface. Assume the following:\n- Fully plastic asperity deformation controls the real contact area so that the mean contact pressure at each microjunction equals the indentation hardness of the softer surface in contact.\n- Heat flows through many isolated circular microcontacts; outside each microcontact, each body behaves as a semi-infinite solid, and the interstitial gaps do not conduct (negligible gas conduction and radiation).\n- The surface statistics (including the root-mean-square slope) are unchanged between trials, and the microcontact size distribution scales self-consistently with real area under the plasticity condition.\n- The coating is mechanically and thermally homogeneous over the contact depth so that the softer phase controlling plasticity in Trial C is the coating with hardness $H_c$.\n\nYou are given the material properties:\n- Base metal: $k_b = 45\\ \\mathrm{W \\cdot m^{-1} \\cdot K^{-1}}$, $H_b = 3.0\\times 10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$.\n- Coating: $k_c = 400\\ \\mathrm{W \\cdot m^{-1} \\cdot K^{-1}}$, $H_c = 0.80\\times 10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$.\n\nStarting from Fourier’s law of heat conduction and the classical constriction resistance of a circular contact between two semi-infinite solids, together with the plastic contact criterion relating real contact area $A_r$ to applied force $F$, derive expressions that relate the ratios $A_{r,C}/A_{r,B}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{con},C}/R_{\\mathrm{con},B}$ to the given properties, where $B$ denotes the baseline trial and $C$ the coated trial.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of contact mechanics and heat transfer, well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions, and the provided data are sufficient for a unique solution. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and evaluation of two ratios: the ratio of real contact areas, $A_{r,C}/A_{r,B}$, and the ratio of thermal contact resistances per unit nominal area, $R_{\\mathrm{con},C}/R_{\\mathrm{con},B}$.\n\nFirst, we address the ratio of real contact areas, $A_{r,C}/A_{r,B}$.\nThe problem states that fully plastic asperity deformation governs the contact. Under this condition, the real contact area, $A_r$, is determined by the balance between the total applied normal force, $F$, and the indentation hardness of the softer material in contact, $H$. This relationship is given by:\n$$A_r = \\frac{F}{H}$$\nThe total applied force $F$ is the product of the uniform nominal pressure $P$ and the nominal contact area $A_n$:\n$$F = P A_n$$\nSince both $P$ and $A_n$ are fixed for both trials, the force $F$ is constant. Thus, the real contact area is inversely proportional to the effective hardness of the interface:\n$$A_r \\propto \\frac{1}{H}$$\n\nFor Trial B (baseline), the contact is between two identical base metal solids. The hardness of both surfaces is $H_b$. Therefore, the effective hardness is $H_B = H_b$. The real contact area for Trial B is:\n$$A_{r,B} = \\frac{P A_n}{H_b}$$\n\nFor Trial C (coated), the contact is between a coated solid (hardness $H_c$) and an uncoated base metal solid (hardness $H_b$). The problem specifies that the mean contact pressure equals the indentation hardness of the softer surface. We are given $H_c = 0.80 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$ and $H_b = 3.0 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$. Since $H_c  H_b$, the coating is the softer material. The effective hardness for Trial C is therefore $H_C = H_c$. The real contact area for Trial C is:\n$$A_{r,C} = \\frac{P A_n}{H_c}$$\n\nThe ratio of the real contact areas is then:\n$$\\frac{A_{r,C}}{A_{r,B}} = \\frac{P A_n / H_c}{P A_n / H_b} = \\frac{H_b}{H_c}$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the first requested ratio.\n\nNext, we derive the ratio of the thermal contact resistances, $R_{\\mathrm{con},C}/R_{\\mathrm{con},B}$.\nThe overall thermal contact resistance per unit nominal area, $R_{\\mathrm{con}}$, is the inverse of the thermal contact conductance per unit nominal area, $h_c$.\n$$R_{\\mathrm{con}} = \\frac{1}{h_c}$$\nFor heat flow through a multitude of microcontacts, the total conductance is a function of the material properties, the surface topography, and the real area of contact. According to the Cooper-Mikic-Yovanovich (CMY) model for plastic contacts, which is consistent with the problem's assumptions (identical surface topography, plastic deformation, self-similar scaling), the conductance $h_c$ is given by:\n$$h_c = C_1 k_s \\frac{A_r}{A_n}$$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant determined by the surface topography (specifically, the RMS slope of the asperities), and $k_s$ is the effective thermal conductivity of the contacting pair. The real area fraction $A_r/A_n$ can be expressed as $P/H$. Therefore:\n$$h_c = C_1 k_s \\frac{P}{H}$$\nSince the nominal pressure $P$ and the surface topography (and thus $C_1$) are identical for both trials, the conductance $h_c$ is directly proportional to the ratio $k_s/H$.\n$$h_c \\propto \\frac{k_s}{H}$$\nConsequently, the resistance $R_{\\mathrm{con}}$ is proportional to $H/k_s$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{con}} \\propto \\frac{H}{k_s}$$\nThe effective thermal conductivity, $k_s$, for contact between two semi-infinite solids with thermal conductivities $k_1$ and $k_2$ is defined as the harmonic mean:\n$$k_s = \\frac{2 k_1 k_2}{k_1 + k_2}$$\n\nFor Trial B, the contact is between two solids of the same base metal ($k_1 = k_2 = k_b$). The effective hardness is $H_B = H_b$. The effective conductivity is:\n$$k_{s,B} = \\frac{2 k_b k_b}{k_b + k_b} = k_b$$\nThe resistance for Trial B is proportional to:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{con},B} \\propto \\frac{H_b}{k_b}$$\n\nFor Trial C, the contact is between the coating ($k_c$) and the base metal ($k_b$). The problem states the coating is sufficiently thick ($t \\gg a$) to be treated as a semi-infinite solid for the thermal analysis. The effective hardness is $H_C = H_c$.
