It presents a classical problem in transient heat transfer that is suitable for dimensional analysis. All necessary physical parameters and conditions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or violations of fundamental principles. The problem is valid.\n\nThe temperature distribution $T(x,t)$ within the slab is governed by the principles of conservation of energy (leading to the one-dimensional heat equation), Fourier's law of heat conduction, and Newton's law of cooling for the boundary condition. The full set of variables and parameters that describe the phenomenon is: the dependent variable, temperature $T$, which is a function of position $x$ and time $t$; the initial temperature $T_i$; the ambient fluid temperature $T_\\infty$; the slab half-thickness $L$; and the material properties: thermal conductivity $k$, density $\\rho$, specific heat capacity $c_p$, and the surface heat transfer coefficient $h$.\n\nThe governing partial differential equation and boundary conditions are linear with respect to temperature. This linearity implies that the principle of superposition applies. A crucial consequence is that the solution depends not on the absolute temperatures $T$, $T_i$, and $T_\\infty$, but on their differences. We can define a normalized, dimensionless temperature, $\\Theta$, as:\n$$ \\Theta = \\frac{T(x,t) - T_\\infty}{T_i - T_\\infty} $$\nBecause of the linearity and the uniform initial condition, this dimensionless temperature $\\Theta$ must be independent of the initial temperature difference $T_i - T_\\infty$. This key step constitutes the reduction in complexity mentioned in the problem statement. By framing the problem in terms of $\\Theta$, we have combined the three temperature-related quantities ($T$, $T_i$, $T_\\infty$) into a single dimensionless dependent variable.\n\nThe problem now is to determine the dimensionless groups that govern $\\Theta$. The physical parameters that $\\Theta$ depends upon are:\n1. Position, $x$\n2. Time, $t$\n3. Slab half-thickness, $L$\n4. Heat transfer coefficient, $h$\n5. Thermal conductivity, $k$\n6.

The solution for the dimensionless temperature $\\Theta$ can therefore be expressed as a function of these three groups:\n$$ \\Theta = f(\\Pi_1, \\Pi_2, \\Pi_3) $$\nTo find these groups, we select a set of $j=4$ repeating variables from our list that, combined, contain all fundamental dimensions and are dimensionally independent.

To address this, we transform the problem into one with homogeneous boundary conditions. Since a constant heat flux is applied to an otherwise insulated slab, the total energy content will increase linearly with time, and a steady-state solution does not exist. The temperature will approach a quasi-steady profile that increases linearly in time.

Substituting into the boundary conditions:\n$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}(0,t) = C_3 = 0$.\n$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}(L,t) = 2C_2 L = \\frac{q''_0}{k}$, which implies $C_2 = \\frac{q''_0}{2kL}$.\nFrom the heat equation, $C_1 = 2\\alpha C_2 = 2\\alpha \\frac{q''_0}{2kL} = \\frac{\\alpha q''_0}{kL}$.\nWe can set the arbitrary constant $C_4$ to zero, as it can be absorbed into the transient solution $\\theta(x,t)$. Thus, we define the auxiliary function as:\n$$\nv(x,t) = \\frac{\\alpha q''_0 t}{kL} + \\frac{q''_0 x^2}{2kL}\n$$\nNow we formulate the IBVP for $\\theta(x,t) = T(x,t) - v(x,t)$.\nSubstituting into the heat equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\theta + v) = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}(\\theta + v) \\implies \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial x^2} + \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\alpha q''_0}{kL} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial x^2} + \\alpha \\left(\\frac{q''_0}{kL}\\right) \\implies \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThe PDE for $\\theta(x,t)$ is homogeneous.\nThe boundary conditions for $\\theta(x,t)$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial x}(0,t) = \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}(0,t) - \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}(0,t) = 0 - 0 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial x}(L,t) = \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}(L,t) - \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}(L,t) = \\frac{q''_0}{k} - \\frac{q''_0 L}{kL} = 0\n$$\nBoth boundary conditions for $\\theta(x,t)$ are homogeneous.\nThe initial condition for $\\theta(x,t)$ is:\n$$\n\\theta(x,0) = T(x,0) - v(x,0) = T_i - \\left(\\frac{\\alpha q''_0 (0)}{kL} + \\frac{q''_0 x^2}{2kL}\\right) = T_i - \\frac{q''_0 x^2}{2kL}\n$$\nWe solve for $\\theta(x,t)$ using separation of variables. Let $\\theta(x,t) = X(x)\\tau(t)$. Substituting into the homogeneous heat equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\alpha \\tau} \\frac{d\\tau}{dt} = \\frac{1}{X} \\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} = -\\lambda^2\n$$\nwhere $-\\lambda^2$ is the separation constant. This gives two ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tau}{dt} + \\alpha \\lambda^2 \\tau = 0 \\implies \\tau(t) = C \\exp(-\\alpha \\lambda^2 t)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} + \\lambda^2 X = 0 \\implies X(x) = A \\cos(\\lambda x) + B \\sin(\\lambda x)\n$$\nApplying the homogeneous boundary conditions to $X(x)$:\n$X'(0) = 0 \\implies -A\\lambda \\sin(0) + B\\lambda \\cos(0) = B\\lambda = 0$. For non-trivial solutions, we assume $\\lambda \\neq 0$ for now, so $B=0$.\n$X'(L) = 0 \\implies -A\\lambda \\sin(\\lambda L) = 0$. To have a non-trivial solution ($A \\neq 0$), we require $\\sin(\\lambda L) = 0$.\nThis is the eigenvalue condition: $\\lambda L = n\\pi$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}$.\nWe must also consider the case $\\lambda=0$. The equation for $X$ becomes $X''(x)=0$, so $X(x) = C_1 x + C_2$. The boundary conditions give $X'(0)=C_1=0$ and $X'(L)=C_1=0$. Thus, $X_0(x) = C_2$ is a valid solution. We choose $X_0(x)=1$. For $\\lambda_0=0$, the solution for $\\tau$ is $\\tau(t) = \\text{constant}$.\nThe eigenfunctions are $X_n(x) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$ for $n=0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n\nThe general solution for $\\theta(x,t)$ is a superposition of all product solutions:\n$$\n\\theta(x,t) = C_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\lambda_n^2 t\\right) \\cos(\\lambda_n x) = C_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\frac{n^2\\pi^2}{L^2} t\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\nThe coefficients $C_n$ are determined from the initial condition using the orthogonality of the eigenfunctions:\n$$\n\\theta(x,0) = C_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) = T_i - \\frac{q''_0 x^2}{2kL}\n$$\nFor $n=0$, we integrate over $[0, L]$:\n$$\n\\int_0^L C_0 dx = \\int_0^L \\left(T_i - \\frac{q''_0 x^2}{2kL}\\right) dx\n$$\n$$\nC_0 L = \\left[ T_i x - \\frac{q''_0 x^3}{6kL} \\right]_0^L = T_i L - \\frac{q''_0 L^3}{6kL} = T_i L - \\frac{q''_0 L^2}{6k}\n$$\n$$\nC_0 = T_i - \\frac{q''_0 L}{6k}\n$$\nFor $n \\ge 1$, we multiply by $\\cos\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{L}\\right)$ and integrate over $[0, L]$:\n$$\n\\int_0^L C_n \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) dx = \\int_0^L \\left(T_i - \\frac{q''_0 x^2}{2kL}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) dx\n$$\nThe left side is $C_n \\frac{L}{2}$. For the right side, the integral of the $T_i$ term is zero. We evaluate the remaining integral:\n$$\nC_n \\frac{L}{2} = -\\frac{q''_0}{2kL} \\int_0^L x^2 \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) dx\n$$\nUsing integration by parts twice, we find:\n$$\n\\int_0^L x^2 \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) dx = \\left[\\frac{L x^2}{n\\pi}\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) + \\frac{2L^2 x}{(n\\pi)^2}\\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) - \\frac{2L^3}{(n\\pi)^3}\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right]_0^L = \\frac{2L^3}{(n\\pi)^2}\\cos(n\\pi) = \\frac{2L^3}{(n\\pi)^2}(-1)^n\n$$\nSo,\n$$\nC_n \\frac{L}{2} = -\\frac{q''_0}{2kL} \\left(\\frac{2L^3}{(n\\pi)^2}(-1)^n\\right) = -\\frac{q''_0 L^2}{k(n\\pi)^2}(-1)^n\n$$\n$$\nC_n = -\\frac{2q''_0 L}{k(n\\pi)^2}(-1)^n = \\frac{2q''_0 L}{k(n\\pi)^2}(-1)^{n+1}\n$$\nThe full solution for $\\theta(x,t)$ is:\n$$\n\\theta(x,t) = T_i - \\frac{q''_0 L}{6k} + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2q''_0 L(-1)^{n+1}}{k(n\\pi)^2} \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\frac{n^2\\pi^2}{L^2} t\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, we construct the solution for $T(x,t) = \\theta(x,t) + v(x,t)$:\n$$\nT(x,t) = T_i - \\frac{q''_0 L}{6k} + \\frac{\\alpha q''_0 t}{kL} + \\frac{q''_0 x^2}{2kL} + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2q''_0 L(-1)^{n+1}}{k(n\\pi)^2} \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\frac{n^2\\pi^2}{L^2} t\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\nWe need the surface temperature at the fluxed face, $T_s(t) = T(L,t)$.

Grouping the constant terms:\n$$\nT_i - \\frac{q''_0 L}{6k} + \\frac{q''_0 L}{2k} = T_i + \\frac{-q''_0 L + 3q''_0 L}{6k} = T_i + \\frac{2q''_0 L}{6k} = T_i + \\frac{q''_0 L}{3k}\n$$\nThe final expression for the surface temperature is:\n$$\nT_s(t) = T_i + \\frac{q''_0 \\alpha t}{kL} + \\frac{q''_0 L}{3k} - \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2q''_0 L}{k(n\\pi)^2} \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\frac{n^2\\pi^2}{L^2} t\\right)\n$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$\nT_s(t) = T_i + \\frac{q''_0 \\alpha t}{kL} + \\frac{q''_0 L}{3k} - \\frac{2q''_0 L}{k\\pi^2} \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^2} \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 t}{L^2}\\right)\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{T_i + \\frac{q''_0 \\alpha t}{kL} + \\frac{q''_0 L}{3k} - \\frac{2q''_0 L}{k \\pi^2} \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha n^2 \\pi^2 t}{L^2}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2526117"}]}
