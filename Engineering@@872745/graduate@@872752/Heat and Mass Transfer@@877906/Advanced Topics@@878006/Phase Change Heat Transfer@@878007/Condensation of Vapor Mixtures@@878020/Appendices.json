The equation for the flux of species $A$ simplifies to:\n$$N_A = -c D_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{dy_A}{dz} + y_A N_A$$\nThis equation reveals the physical mechanism: the diffusion of $A$ down its concentration gradient is opposed by the bulk flow (Stefan flow) required to displace the stagnant noncondensable species $B$. The accumulation of species $B$ at the interface creates a diffusive barrier that limits the condensation rate. Rearranging the equation to separate variables for integration:\n$$N_A (1 - y_A) = -c D_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{dy_A}{dz}$$\n$$N_A dz = -\\frac{c D_{\\text{eff}}}{1 - y_A} dy_A$$\nFor steady-state transport, $N_A$ is constant along the path $z$.

The analysis proceeds by first establishing the correct thermodynamic expression for the heat released during condensation of a non-ideal binary mixture and then comparing this to the simplified approximation proposed by the engineer.\n\nFirst, let us establish the notation. The total molar condensation flux is $N''$, and the molar fluxes of species $A$ and $B$ are $N_{A}''$ and $N_{B}''$, respectively, such that $N'' = N_{A}'' + N_{B}''$. The problem states that the total molar flux is $N'' = 0.200$ mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. For steady-state condensation, the composition of the material crossing the vapor-liquid interface must be identical to the composition of the liquid being formed. The interfacial liquid composition is given as $x_{A} = 0.40$ and $x_{B} = 0.60$. Therefore, the molar fluxes of the individual components are $N_{A}'' = x_{A} N''$ and $N_{B}'' = x_{B} N''$.\n\nThe true local heat flux released to the wall, $q''_{\\text{true}}$, is determined by an enthalpy balance at the interface.

Thus, the quantity in the brackets is the molar enthalpy of condensation for the mixture, $\\Delta \\bar{H}_{\\text{cond,mix}} = \\bar{H}_{v} - \\bar{H}_{L}$.\n\nTo evaluate this enthalpy change, we utilize the fact that enthalpy is a state function by constructing a convenient thermodynamic path from the initial state (vapor mixture) to the final state (liquid mixture):\n1.  Unmix $1$ mole of vapor mixture at $T_{i}$ with composition $(x_{A}, x_{B})$ into $x_{A}$ moles of pure vapor $A$ and $x_{B}$ moles of pure vapor $B$, both at $T_{i}$. As the vapor phase is treated as an ideal gas, the enthalpy of mixing is zero. Therefore, the enthalpy of the vapor mixture is simply the mole-fraction-weighted average of the pure component enthalpies: $\\bar{H}_{v} = x_{A} H_{A,v}^{\\text{pure}} + x_{B} H_{B,v}^{\\text{pure}}$. The enthalpy change for this step is $\\Delta H_{1} = 0$.\n2.  Condense the pure components at $T_{i}$. The enthalpy change for condensing $x_{A}$ moles of $A$ and $x_{B}$ moles of $B$ is given by $\\Delta H_{2} = -x_{A} L_{A}^{\\text{sat}}(T_{i}) - x_{B} L_{B}^{\\text{sat}}(T_{i})$, where $L_{i}^{\\text{sat}}$ is the molar latent heat of condensation of pure species $i$.\n3.  Mix the $x_{A}$ moles of pure liquid $A$ and $x_{B}$ moles of pure liquid $B$ at $T_{i}$ to form $1$ mole of a non-ideal liquid mixture. The enthalpy change of this process is the molar heat of mixing, which is equal to the excess molar enthalpy, $H^{E}$.

The geometry of wetting dictates that the radius of the pore, $r$, the radius of curvature of the meniscus, $R_c$, and the Young contact angle, $\\theta$, are related by $r = R_c \\cos\\theta$. For a spherical surface, the two principal radii of curvature are equal, $R_1 = R_2 = R_c$. Therefore, the radius of curvature is $R_c = \\frac{r}{\\cos\\theta}$. Substituting this into the Young-Laplace equation gives the capillary pressure jump, $\\Delta P_{cap}$:\n$$\n\\Delta P_{cap} = \\sigma \\left( \\frac{1}{R_c} + \\frac{1}{R_c} \\right) = \\frac{2\\sigma}{R_c} = \\frac{2\\sigma \\cos\\theta}{r}\n$$\nThis pressure difference, with the lower pressure on the liquid side for a wetting case ($\\theta  90^\\circ$), is the sole driving force for the liquid to imbibe into the pore.\n\nNext, we analyze the motion of the liquid column. As the liquid imbibes a distance $x(t)$ into the pore, it experiences a viscous pressure drop, $\\Delta P_{vis}$, which resists the flow. The problem states that the flow is laminar. For steady, laminar flow in a cylindrical tube of radius $r$ and length $x(t)$, the viscous pressure drop is given by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n$$\n\\Delta P_{vis} = \\frac{8 \\mu Q x(t)}{\\pi r^4}\n$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the liquid and $Q$ is the volumetric flow rate. The flow rate is related to the velocity of the imbibition front, $\\frac{dx}{dt}$, by $Q = A \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\pi r^2 \\frac{dx}{dt}$. Substituting this expression for $Q$ into the Hagen-Poiseuille equation yields:\n$$\n\\Delta P_{vis} = \\frac{8 \\mu (\\pi r^2 \\frac{dx}{dt}) x(t)}{\\pi r^4} = \\frac{8 \\mu x(t)}{r^2} \\frac{dx}{dt}\n$$\nUnder the assumption that inertia is negligible, the system is in a quasi-steady state where the capillary driving pressure is instantaneously balanced by the viscous resistive pressure drop: $\\Delta P_{cap} = \\Delta P_{vis}$.\n$$\n\\frac{2\\sigma \\cos\\theta}{r} = \\frac{8 \\mu x(t)}{r^2} \\frac{dx}{dt}\n$$\nThis is a separable first-order ordinary differential equation describing the imbibition dynamics. We rearrange it to solve for $x(t)$:\n$$\nx \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{2\\sigma r^2 \\cos\\theta}{8 \\mu r} = \\frac{\\sigma r \\cos\\theta}{4 \\mu}\n$$\nWe integrate this equation with the initial condition that the imbibed length is zero at time zero, i.e., $x(0) = 0$.\n$$\n\\int_0^{x(t)} x' dx' = \\int_0^t \\frac{\\sigma r \\cos\\theta}{4 \\mu} dt'\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} x(t)^2 = \\left( \\frac{\\sigma r \\cos\\theta}{4 \\mu} \\right) t\n$$\nThe relation between the imbibed length $x(t)$ and time $t$ is therefore given by the Lucas-Washburn equation:\n$$\nx(t) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma r \\cos\\theta}{2 \\mu} t}\n$$\n\nFinally, we use the provided data to calculate the time required for the imbibition front to reach the pore depth, $L$. First, we must calculate the surface tension $\\sigma$ and dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ for the mixed condensate.\nThe mole fraction of component B is $x_{B} = 0.30$, so the mole fraction of component A is $x_{A} = 1 - x_{B} = 0.70$.\nThe surface tension $\\sigma$ is calculated using the given correlation:\n$$\n\\sigma(x_{B}) = \\sigma_{A} (1 - x_{B}) + \\sigma_{B} x_{B} - k x_{B}(1 - x_{B})\n$$\nSubstituting the provided values $\\sigma_{A} = 0.072\\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$, $\\sigma_{B} = 0.022\\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$, and $k = 0.018\\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$:\n$$\n\\sigma = (0.072)(0.70) + (0.022)(0.30) - (0.018)(0.30)(0.70) = 0.0504 + 0.0066 - 0.00378 = 0.05322\\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$\nThe dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ is calculated using the Grunberg–Nissan relation:\n$$\n\\ln \\mu = x_{A} \\ln \\mu_{A} + x_{B} \\ln \\mu_{B} + x_{A} x_{B} d_{12}\n$$\nSubstituting the values $\\mu_{A} = 8.90 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}$, $\\mu_{B} = 1.07 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}$, and $d_{12} = 0.50$:\n$$\n\\ln \\mu = (0.70) \\ln(8.90 \\times 10^{-4}) + (0.30) \\ln(1.07 \\times 10^{-3}) + (0.70)(0.30)(0.50)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln \\mu \\approx (0.70)(-7.024645) + (0.30)(-6.840396) + 0.105\n$$\n$$\n\\ln \\mu \\approx -4.917252 - 2.052119 + 0.105 = -6.864371\n$$\n$$\n\\mu = \\exp(-6.864371) \\approx 1.0443 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nNow we can determine the time $t_{fill}$ for the imbibition front to reach the full depth of the pore, $x(t_{fill}) = L$.
