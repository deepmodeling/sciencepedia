It is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, providing all necessary information for a derivation from first principles. There is one minor ambiguity in the original phrasing \"steady $y$-momentum balance\". For a vertical plate with coordinate $x$ along its length and $y$ normal to it, the fluid motion is driven by gravity in the $x$-direction. The momentum balance in the $y$-direction is trivial, establishing that pressure is constant across the film (under boundary layer approximations). The non-trivial momentum balance, which governs the velocity profile, is in the $x$-direction, balancing viscous and body forces. It is standard practice to interpret the problem as requiring analysis of this $x$-momentum equation. With this clarification, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be constructed.\n\nWe establish a coordinate system where $x$ is the vertical coordinate measured downwards from the top edge of the plate ($x=0$), and $y$ is the coordinate normal to the plate, with $y=0$ at the wall and $y=\\delta(x)$ at the liquid-vapor interface.\n\nThe velocity of the condensate film, $u$, is in the $x$-direction. Under the Nusselt assumptions, the inertia terms in the momentum equation are negligible. The momentum balance in the $x$-direction simplifies to a balance between the viscous force and the gravitational body force. Assuming the vapor density is negligible compared to the liquid density ($\\rho_v \\ll \\rho_l$), the body force is due to the liquid's weight. The governing equation for the liquid velocity profile $u(y)$ is:\n$$\n\\mu_l \\frac{d^2 u}{dy^2} + \\rho_l g = 0\n$$\nWe solve this equation subject to two boundary conditions:\n$1$. No-slip condition at the wall: $u(y=0) = 0$.\n$2$. Negligible shear stress at the liquid-vapor interface (quiescent vapor): $\\frac{du}{dy}\\Big|_{y=\\delta} = 0$.\n\nIntegrating the momentum equation once with respect to $y$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dy} = -\\frac{\\rho_l g}{\\mu_l} y + C_1\n$$\nApplying the zero-shear condition at $y=\\delta(x)$:\n$$\n0 = -\\frac{\\rho_l g}{\\mu_l} \\delta + C_1 \\implies C_1 = \\frac{\\rho_l g}{\\mu_l} \\delta\n$$\nSubstituting $C_1$ back and integrating a second time:\n$$\nu(y) = \\int \\left( -\\frac{\\rho_l g}{\\mu_l} y + \\frac{\\rho_l g}{\\mu_l} \\delta \\right) dy = -\\frac{\\rho_l g}{\\mu_l} \\frac{y^2}{2} + \\frac{\\rho_l g}{\\mu_l} \\delta y + C_2\n$$\nApplying the no-slip condition at $y=0$:\n$$\n0 = 0 + 0 + C_2 \\implies C_2 = 0\n$$\nThe velocity profile in the liquid film is therefore:\n$$\nu(y) = \\frac{\\rho_l g}{\\mu_l} \\left( \\delta y - \\frac{y^2}{2} \\right)\n$$\nThe mass flow rate of condensate per unit width of the plate, $\\dot{m}'(x)$, is found by integrating the velocity profile multiplied by the density across the film thickness:\n$$\n\\dot{m}'(x) = \\int_0^{\\delta(x)} \\rho_l u(y) dy = \\rho_l \\int_0^{\\delta(x)} \\frac{\\rho_l g}{\\mu_l} \\left( \\delta y - \\frac{y^2}{2} \\right) dy\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{m}'(x) = \\frac{\\rho_l^2 g}{\\mu_l} \\left[ \\frac{\\delta y^2}{2} - \\frac{y^3}{6} \\right]_0^{\\delta(x)} = \\frac{\\rho_l^2 g \\delta(x)^3}{3 \\mu_l}\n$$\nNext, we perform an energy balance. The heat transfer across the film is by conduction. For a linear temperature profile, the local heat flux $q''(x)$ is given by Fourier's law:\n$$\nq''(x) = k_l \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{sat}} - T_w}{\\delta(x)} = \\frac{k_l \\Delta T}{\\delta(x)}\n$$\nThis heat flux is supplied by the latent heat of vaporization $h_{fg}$ released during condensation. The local rate of condensation per unit area is the rate of change of mass flow rate per unit width, differentiated with respect to $x$, which is $\\frac{d\\dot{m}'}{dx}$.

Substituting the expression for $\\delta(x)$:\n$$\nh_x = \\frac{k_l}{\\left[ \\frac{4 k_l \\mu_l \\Delta T x}{\\rho_l^2 g h_{fg}} \\right]^{1/4}} = \\left[ \\frac{k_l^4 \\rho_l^2 g h_{fg}}{4 k_l \\mu_l \\Delta T x} \\right]^{1/4} = \\left[ \\frac{k_l^3 \\rho_l^2 g h_{fg}}{4 \\mu_l x} \\right]^{1/4} (\\Delta T)^{-1/4}\n$$\nThis provides the dependence of $h_x$ on $x$ and $\\Delta T$, as requested.

This is because a larger temperature difference drives a higher rate of condensation, leading to a thicker liquid film on the plate. A thicker film offers greater thermal resistance to heat conduction, thereby reducing the heat transfer coefficient.

Substituting this back gives:\n$$ \\bar{h}_L = \\frac{4}{3L} \\left[ \\frac{\\rho_l g(\\rho_l - \\rho_v) h_{fg} k_l^3}{4 \\mu_l \\Delta T} \\right]^{1/4} L^{3/4} = \\frac{4}{3} \\left[ \\frac{\\rho_l g(\\rho_l - \\rho_v) h_{fg} k_l^3}{4 \\mu_l \\Delta T L} \\right]^{1/4} $$\nTreating all parameters except $\\mu_l$ and $k_l$ as a constant of proportionality, $C$, the parametric dependence is:\n$$ \\bar{h}_L \\propto \\left( \\frac{k_l^3}{\\mu_l} \\right)^{1/4} $$\nThis is the required derivation of the parametric dependence.\n\nNow, we compute the ratio of the average heat transfer coefficient when properties are evaluated at saturation temperature, $\\bar{h}_{L, \\mathrm{sat}}$, to that when properties are evaluated at the film temperature, $\\bar{h}_{L, f}$.
