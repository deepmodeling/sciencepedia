No flaws are identified.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the kinetic-limited net interfacial mass flux, $m''_{\\mathrm{kin}}$. This derivation begins with the kinetic theory of gases. The one-sided mass flux $J$ (mass per unit area per unit time) of molecules of an ideal gas impinging on a surface is a standard result. For a Maxwellian velocity distribution, this flux is given by:\n$$J = p \\sqrt{\\frac{M}{2 \\pi R_u T}}$$\nwhere $p$ is the pressure, $M$ is the molar mass of the gas, $R_u$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe net mass flux across the interface, $m''_{\\mathrm{kin}}$, is the difference between the evaporative flux from the liquid and the condensative flux from the vapor.\nThe evaporative flux, $m''_{\\mathrm{evap}}$, originates from the liquid phase. It is modeled as the flux that would be emitted into a vacuum from a surface at temperature $T_i$. The effective pressure driving this flux is the saturation pressure, $p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_i)$. The accommodation coefficient, $\\alpha$, represents the fraction of molecules that undergo phase change upon interaction. Therefore, the evaporation flux is:\n$$m''_{\\mathrm{evap}} = \\alpha \\sqrt{\\frac{M_w}{2 \\pi R_u T_i}} p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_i)$$\nThe condensative flux, $m''_{\\mathrm{cond}}$, is due to vapor molecules from the gas phase impinging on and being absorbed by the liquid surface. This flux depends on the partial pressure of the vapor at the interface, $p_{v,i}$. In the kinetic limit where transport to the interface is infinitely fast, $p_{v,i}$ is the pressure in the bulk gas, $p_v$. The condensation flux is thus:\n$$m''_{\\mathrm{cond}} = \\alpha \\sqrt{\\frac{M_w}{2 \\pi R_u T_i}} p_v$$\nThe assumption of a single accommodation coefficient $\\alpha$ for both evaporation and condensation is a consequence of detailed balance at equilibrium.\n\nThe net mass flux, which is the quantity sought, is the difference between these two opposing fluxes:\n$$m''_{\\mathrm{kin}} = m''_{\\mathrm{evap}} - m''_{\\mathrm{cond}}$$\n$$m''_{\\mathrm{kin}} = \\alpha \\sqrt{\\frac{M_w}{2 \\pi R_u T_i}} \\left( p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_i) - p_v \\right)$$\nThis is the Hertz-Knudsen-Schrage equation for the kinetic-limited mass flux.

Physical processes in series are limited by the slowest step, which corresponds to the highest resistance. The process with the smaller potential flux is the rate-limiting one. Therefore, under these conditions, gas-phase diffusion is the rate-limiting process. The actual evaporation rate would be very close to $m''_{\\mathrm{diff}}$.\n\nThe problem, however, asks only for the value of the kinetic-limited mass flux, $m''_{\\mathrm{kin}}$.

We will derive expressions for both heat fluxes and then solve for $B_{m,\\star}$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the heat transfer through the liquid film. The problem states that heat is transferred by one-dimensional, steady conduction. According to Fourier's law, the heat flux, $q''_{\\ell}$, is given by:\n$$\nq''_{\\ell} = -k_{\\ell} \\frac{dT}{dy}\n$$\nwhere $k_{\\ell}$ is the thermal conductivity of the liquid and $y$ is the coordinate normal to the wall, starting at $y=0$ at the wall.

Vapor ($v$) diffuses through the noncondensable carrier gas ($a$) to the interface, where it condenses. This creates a net mass flux towards the interface, known as Stefan flow. The mass flux of the noncondensable gas at the interface is zero, $n''_{a}=0$. The total mass flux, $n''$, is thus equal to the vapor mass flux, $n''=n''_{v}$.

Integrate the local energy balance over a pillbox surrounding the interface to obtain the Stefan jump condition,\n$$\n\\left[ k \\nabla T \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\right]_{\\Gamma} = \\rho_{v} h_{fg} v_{n}.\n$$\nWith negligible vapor conduction, the jump reduces to the liquid-side normal heat flux evaluated at the interface:\n$$\nk \\, \\nabla T \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\big|_{\\Gamma}^{(\\ell)} = \\rho_{v} h_{fg} v_{n}.\n$$\n\nGeometry and kinematics: consider a hemispherical bubble of radius $R(t)$ attached to a planar wall. The interface area is $A_{\\Gamma}(t) = 2 \\pi R^{2}(t)$, the bubble volume is $V(t) = \\tfrac{2}{3} \\pi R^{3}(t)$, and the normal speed is spatially uniform $v_{n} = \\dot{R}(t)$ by symmetry. The local jump condition integrated over the hemispherical surface yields the latent heat consumption rate,\n$$\n\\dot{Q}_{lat}(t) = \\rho_{v} h_{fg} \\, \\frac{dV}{dt} = \\rho_{v} h_{fg} \\, 2 \\pi R^{2}(t) \\, \\dot{R}(t).\n$$\n\nThermal driving mechanisms: two distinct heat inputs supply the latent heat.\n\n- Wall heat flux through the footprint. Assume the wall beneath the hemispherical footprint $\\pi R^{2}(t)$ supplies a uniform heat flux $q_{w}^{\\prime\\prime}$, all of which is consumed by phase change in the bubble. The wall contribution is\n$$\n\\dot{Q}_{wall}(t) = q_{w}^{\\prime\\prime} \\, \\pi R^{2}(t).\n$$\n\n- Diffusion-limited heat transfer from superheated liquid. The liquid initially at $T_{\\infty} = T_{sat} + \\Delta T$ is cooled to $T_{sat}$ at the moving interface. For early times when the thermal boundary layer in the liquid is thin compared to macroscopic scales, the local heat flux to a boundary suddenly held at $T_{sat}$ in a semi-infinite medium initially at $T_{\\infty}$ is well-approximated by the similarity solution\n$$\nq_{\\ell}(t) \\approx \\frac{k \\Delta T}{\\sqrt{\\pi \\alpha_{\\ell} t}}.\n$$\nApproximating the near-interface transport as locally planar and applying this flux uniformly over the hemispherical area gives\n$$\n\\dot{Q}_{liq}(t) \\approx \\left( 2 \\pi R^{2}(t) \\right) \\, \\frac{k \\Delta T}{\\sqrt{\\pi \\alpha_{\\ell} t}}.\n$$\n\nEnergy balance at the interface then yields\n$$\n\\dot{Q}_{lat}(t) = \\dot{Q}_{wall}(t) + \\dot{Q}_{liq}(t),\n$$\nthat is,\n$$\n\\rho_{v} h_{fg} \\, 2 \\pi R^{2}(t) \\, \\dot{R}(t) \\;=\\; q_{w}^{\\prime\\prime} \\, \\pi R^{2}(t) \\;+\\; 2 \\pi R^{2}(t) \\, \\frac{k \\Delta T}{\\sqrt{\\pi \\alpha_{\\ell} t}}.\n$$\nProvided $R(t) &gt; 0$ so that $\\pi R^{2}(t)$ can be canceled, this reduces to a separable ordinary differential equation for the radius:\n$$\n\\dot{R}(t) \\;=\\; \\frac{q_{w}^{\\prime\\prime}}{2 \\, \\rho_{v} \\, h_{fg}} \\;+\\; \\frac{k \\, \\Delta T}{\\rho_{v} \\, h_{fg} \\, \\sqrt{\\pi \\, \\alpha_{\\ell} \\, t}}.\n$$\nWith the initial condition $R(0) = R_{0}$, the solution is obtained by direct integration in time,\n$$\nR(t) \\;=\\; R_{0} \\;+\\; \\left( \\frac{q_{w}^{\\prime\\prime}}{2 \\, \\rho_{v} \\, h_{fg}} \\right) t \\;+\\; \\left( \\frac{2 \\, k \\, \\Delta T}{\\rho_{v} \\, h_{fg} \\, \\sqrt{\\pi \\, \\alpha_{\\ell}}} \\right) \\sqrt{t}.\n$$\nThis closed-form expression is the reduced sharp-interface radius-growth law that emerges from the Level-Set Method formulation with the Stefan jump condition under the stated assumptions. The first term beyond $R_{0}$ represents wall-driven, energy-limited linear growth; the second term represents diffusion-limited, superheat-driven $\\sqrt{t}$ growth.\n\nAlgorithmic design for the program:\n- For each test case, read $q_{w}^{\\prime\\prime}$, $\\Delta T$, and $t$, along with the shared parameters $k$, $\\alpha_{\\ell}$, $\\rho_{v}$, $h_{fg}$, and $R_{0}$.\n- Compute\n$$\nA = \\frac{q_{w}^{\\prime\\prime}}{2 \\, \\rho_{v} \\, h_{fg}}, \\qquad B = \\frac{2 \\, k \\, \\Delta T}{\\rho_{v} \\, h_{fg} \\, \\sqrt{\\pi \\, \\alpha_{\\ell}}},\n$$\nand then evaluate\n$$\nR(t) = R_{0} + A \\, t + B \\, \\sqrt{t}.\n$$\n- Format each $R(t)$ in meters with six significant figures using scientific notation and output all five results in a single comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets in the order $\\big[ R_{A}, R_{B}, R_{C}, R_{D}, R_{E} \\big]$.\n\nThe provided test suite covers:\n- A wall-flux-only case (Case A) to exercise the linear-in-time growth contribution.\n- A superheat-only case (Case B) to exercise the diffusion-limited $\\sqrt{t}$ growth contribution.\n- A combined case (Case C) to test superposition of contributions.\n- A zero-driving finite-time case (Case D) where $R(t)$ should remain equal to $R_{0}$.\n- A zero-time case (Case E) to verify the initial condition $R(0) = R_{0}$.\n\nAll results are to be reported in meters as floats with the specified formatting.
