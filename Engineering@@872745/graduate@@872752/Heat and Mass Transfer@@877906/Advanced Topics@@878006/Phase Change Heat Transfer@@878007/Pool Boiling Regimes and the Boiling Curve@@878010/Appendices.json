It is scientifically grounded in the principles of thermodynamics and fluid mechanics concerning boiling nucleation, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed in objective, precise language. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the wall superheat required for nucleation and the subsequent calculation of the reduction in this superheat due to the presence of a dissolved noncondensable gas. The physical model is based on the mechanical equilibrium of a vapor-gas nucleus at the mouth of a re-entrant cavity.\n\nThe condition for mechanical equilibrium of a spherical nucleus is given by the Young-Laplace equation, which relates the pressure inside the nucleus, $p_{i}$, to the pressure in the surrounding liquid, $p_{\\ell}$, and the surface tension, $\\sigma$, at an interface with radius of curvature $r_m$:\n$$ p_{i} = p_{\\ell} + \\frac{2\\sigma}{r_{m}} $$\nThe problem specifies that the internal pressure of the nucleus is the sum of the partial pressure of the vapor, $p_{v}(T_{w})$, which corresponds to the temperature of the adjacent wall, $T_{w}$, and the partial pressure of the dissolved noncondensable gas (air), $p_{g}$. The external liquid pressure is given as the total system pressure, $p_{\\ell} = p_{\\text{tot}}$.

For small superheats, the vapor pressure $p_{v}(T_{w})$ can be approximated by a linear expansion of the saturation curve around the point $(T_{\\text{sat}}(p_{\\text{tot}}), p_{\\text{tot}})$. This is an application of the Clausius-Clapeyron relation:\n$$ p_{v}(T_{w}) \\approx p_{\\text{sat}}(T_{\\text{sat}}(p_{\\text{tot}})) + (T_{w} - T_{\\text{sat}}(p_{\\text{tot}})) \\left. \\frac{dp_{\\text{sat}}}{dT} \\right|_{T_{\\text{sat}}(p_{\\text{tot}})} $$\nRecognizing that $p_{\\text{sat}}(T_{\\text{sat}}(p_{\\text{tot}})) = p_{\\text{tot}}$ and using the definition of $\\Delta T_{\\text{sup}}$, we have:\n$$ p_{v}(T_{w}) \\approx p_{\\text{tot}} + \\Delta T_{\\text{sup}} \\left. \\frac{dp_{\\text{sat}}}{dT} \\right|_{p_{\\text{tot}}} $$\nNow, we substitute this linearized expression for $p_{v}(T_{w})$ back into the mechanical equilibrium equation:\n$$ \\left( p_{\\text{tot}} + \\Delta T_{\\text{sup}} \\left. \\frac{dp_{\\text{sat}}}{dT} \\right|_{p_{\\text{tot}}} \\right) + p_{g} = p_{\\text{tot}} + \\frac{2\\sigma}{r_{m}} $$\nThe term $p_{\\text{tot}}$ cancels, leaving an equation that relates the superheat to the physical properties of the system:\n$$ \\Delta T_{\\text{sup}} \\left. \\frac{dp_{\\text{sat}}}{dT} \\right|_{p_{\\text{tot}}} = \\frac{2\\sigma}{r_{m}} - p_{g} $$\nSolving for the wall superheat, $\\Delta T_{\\text{sup}}$, gives the desired expression:\n$$ \\Delta T_{\\text{sup}} = \\frac{\\frac{2\\sigma}{r_{m}} - p_{g}}{\\left. \\frac{dp_{\\text{sat}}}{dT} \\right|_{p_{\\text{tot}}}} $$\nThis expression explicitly shows that the gas partial pressure, $p_{g}$, reduces the numerator, thereby decreasing the required wall superheat for nucleation compared to a system with pure vapor (where $p_{g}=0$). The term $p_{g}$ effectively offsets the pressure jump due to surface tension.\n\nTo compute the magnitude of the decrease in incipience superheat, we must find the difference between the superheat required for a pure system, $\\Delta T_{\\text{sup, pure}}$ (with $p_{g}=0$), and the superheat required for the gas-containing system, $\\Delta T_{\\text{sup, gas}}$.\nLet $\\delta(\\Delta T_{\\text{sup}})$ represent this decrease:\n$$ \\delta(\\Delta T_{\\text{sup}}) = \\Delta T_{\\text{sup, pure}} - \\Delta T_{\\text{sup, gas}} $$\nUsing our derived expression:\n$$ \\Delta T_{\\text{sup, pure}} = \\frac{\\frac{2\\sigma}{r_{m}}}{\\left. \\frac{dp_{\\text{sat}}}{dT} \\right|_{p_{\\text{tot}}}} $$\n$$ \\delta(\\Delta T_{\\text{sup}}) = \\frac{\\frac{2\\sigma}{r_{m}}}{\\left. \\frac{dp_{\\text{sat}}}{dT} \\right|_{p_{\\text{tot}}}} - \\frac{\\frac{2\\sigma}{r_{m}} - p_{g}}{\\left. \\frac{dp_{\\text{sat}}}{dT} \\right|_{p_{\\text{tot}}}} = \\frac{\\frac{2\\sigma}{r_{m}} - (\\frac{2\\sigma}{r_{m}} - p_{g})}{\\left. \\frac{dp_{\\text{sat}}}{dT} \\right|_{p_{\\text{tot}}}} $$\nThis simplifies to a remarkably direct relationship:\n$$ \\delta(\\Delta T_{\\text{sup}}) = \\frac{p_{g}}{\\left. \\frac{dp_{\\text{sat}}}{dT} \\right|_{p_{\\text{tot}}}} $$\nWe now proceed with numerical evaluation.
