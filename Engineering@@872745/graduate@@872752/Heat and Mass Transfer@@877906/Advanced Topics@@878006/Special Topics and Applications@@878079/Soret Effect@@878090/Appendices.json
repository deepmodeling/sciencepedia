The system reaches a stationary state with zero net diffusive flux of the solute relative to the solvent. In the linear regime of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the solute flux is driven by gradients of the solute’s chemical potential per unit temperature, and the stationary state is characterized by a balance between temperature and composition gradients.\n\nYou may assume the following fundamental ingredients only:\n- Linear force–flux framework with the solute’s diffusive flux proportional to the gradient of its chemical potential divided by temperature.\n- The Gibbs–Helmholtz relation at constant pressure and composition, $\\left(\\partial(\\mu_2/T)/\\partial T\\right)_{p,x_2} = -\\bar{h}_2/T^2$, where $\\mu_2$ is the chemical potential of the solute and $\\bar{h}_2$ is its partial molar enthalpy.\n- Thermodynamic stability of the mixture, which implies a positive curvature of the molar Gibbs free energy and, correspondingly, a positive thermodynamic factor $\\left(\\partial(\\mu_2/T)/\\partial x_2\\right)_{p,T}  0$ in the dilute regime $x_2 \\ll 1$.\n\nAt ambient pressure $p_0$, calorimetry and spectroscopy indicate that the solute’s hydration is exothermic with $\\bar{h}_2(p_0) \\approx -10\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. At an elevated pressure $p_1  p_0$ in the range of a few hundred megapascals, neutron scattering and infrared spectroscopy indicate that compression densifies the water network (reduced tetrahedrality) and weakens solute–water hydrogen bonds relative to water–water interactions in the solute’s hydration shell, yielding $\\bar{h}_2(p_1) \\approx +5\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. Over this pressure range, $\\left(\\partial(\\mu_2/T)/\\partial x_2\\right)_{p,T}$ remains positive and only weakly pressure dependent, and the spatial pressure gradient is negligible, $\\nabla p = 0$.\n\nThe Soret coefficient $S_T$ is defined in the usual way by the steady-state concentration gradient established under a temperature gradient at uniform pressure. Which of the following statements best predicts how pressure-induced changes in the hydrogen-bonding network can flip the sign of $S_T$ and why?\n\nA. $S_T$ changes from positive at $p_0$ to negative at $p_1$ because the sign of $\\bar{h}_2$ flips while the composition derivative $\\left(\\partial(\\mu_2/T)/\\partial x_2\\right)_{p,T}$ stays positive; compression reorganizes hydrogen bonds so that hydration becomes endothermic, inverting the direction of thermodiffusion.\n\nB. $S_T$ remains positive as pressure increases because the viscosity rise reduces mobilities symmetrically; the Soret effect is governed by frictional resistance, and enthalpy changes do not control its sign.\n\nC. $S_T$ changes from negative at $p_0$ to positive at $p_1$ because pressure strengthens solute–water hydrogen bonds, making $\\bar{h}_2$ more negative with pressure; the sign change of $S_T$ is enabled by a pressure-induced sign reversal of $\\left(\\partial(\\mu_2/T)/\\partial x_2\\right)_{p,T}$.\n\nD. $S_T$ flips sign with pressure because the solvation partial molar volume $\\bar{v}_2$ decreases and enters directly into the zero-flux condition even at uniform pressure; enthalpy plays no direct role in determining the sign of $S_T$.", "solution": "We proceed from first principles in linear non-equilibrium thermodynamics and equilibrium thermodynamics.\n\n1) Linear flux–force framework and the stationary condition. In the tracer limit for the solute (component $2$) in a stationary, isobaric field, the diffusive solute flux $J_2$ is, to leading order, proportional to the gradient of the normalized chemical potential,\n$$\nJ_2 \\propto - \\nabla\\!\\left(\\frac{\\mu_2}{T}\\right).\n$$\nAt steady state with zero net diffusive flux of the solute relative to the solvent, we have\n$$\nJ_2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\nabla\\!\\left(\\frac{\\mu_2}{T}\\right) = \\mathbf{0}.\n$$\nExpanding the gradient at constant $p$ in terms of temperature and composition gives\n$$\n0 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial (\\mu_2/T)}{\\partial T}\\right)_{p,x_2} \\nabla T + \\left(\\frac{\\partial (\\mu_2/T)}{\\partial x_2}\\right)_{p,T} \\nabla x_2.\n$$\n\n2) Gibbs–Helmholtz relation. At constant pressure and composition, the Gibbs–Helmholtz relation yields\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial (\\mu_2/T)}{\\partial T}\\right)_{p,x_2} = - \\frac{\\bar{h}_2}{T^2}.\n$$\nSubstituting into the stationary condition, we obtain\n$$\n0 = - \\frac{\\bar{h}_2}{T^2} \\nabla T + \\left(\\frac{\\partial (\\mu_2/T)}{\\partial x_2}\\right)_{p,T} \\nabla x_2,\n$$\nor equivalently,\n$$\n\\nabla x_2 = \\frac{\\bar{h}_2}{T^2} \\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial (\\mu_2/T)}{\\partial x_2}\\right)_{p,T}\\right]^{-1} \\nabla T.\n$$\n\n3) Stability and the sign of the thermodynamic factor. Thermodynamic stability of the binary mixture implies positive curvature of the molar Gibbs free energy with respect to composition, which translates into\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mu_2}{\\partial x_2}\\right)_{p,T}  0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\left(\\frac{\\partial (\\mu_2/T)}{\\partial x_2}\\right)_{p,T}  0\n$$\nat fixed $T$ and $p$. Therefore, the bracketed factor above is positive.\n\n4) Consequence for the induced composition gradient and the Soret coefficient. The last two steps imply that the sign of $\\nabla x_2$ relative to $\\nabla T$ is determined by the sign of $\\bar{h}_2$:\n- If $\\bar{h}_2  0$ (exothermic hydration), then $\\nabla x_2$ is opposite in sign to $\\nabla T$. Under the conventional definition of the Soret coefficient $S_T$ through the steady-state relation between $\\nabla x_2$ and $\\nabla T$ at uniform $p$, this corresponds to $S_T > 0$ (solute enriches on the cold side, often termed thermophobic behavior).\n- If $\\bar{h}_2 > 0$ (endothermic hydration), then $\\nabla x_2$ has the same sign as $\\nabla T$, which corresponds to $S_T  0$ (solute enriches on the hot side, often termed thermophilic behavior).\n\nThus, as pressure changes the hydrogen-bonding network and flips the sign of the solute’s partial molar enthalpy $\\bar{h}_2$, the sign of $S_T$ also flips. The denominator $\\left(\\partial (\\mu_2/T)/\\partial x_2\\right)_{p,T}$ remains positive by stability and, according to the statement of the problem, is only weakly pressure dependent, so it does not induce a sign change.\n\n5) Microscopic mechanism under pressure. Compression of liquid water reduces tetrahedral order and increases local density. For certain solutes (e.g., chaotropes or hydrophobes), this can weaken solute–water hydrogen bonds relative to water–water bonds in the hydration shell. The enthalpic balance of inserting the solute into water can thereby switch from exothermic at ambient pressure (negative $\\bar{h}_2$) to endothermic at elevated pressure (positive $\\bar{h}_2$). By the argument above, this reverses the direction of the steady-state composition gradient relative to the temperature gradient, hence flipping the sign of $S_T$.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\n- Option A: Correct. At $p_0$, since $\\bar{h}_2(p_0) \\approx -10\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}  0$, it implies $S_T > 0$ (solute enriches at the cold side). At $p_1$, since $\\bar{h}_2(p_1) \\approx +5\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} > 0$, it implies $S_T  0$ (solute enriches at the hot side). The reasoning explicitly relies on $\\left(\\partial (\\mu_2/T)/\\partial x_2\\right)_{p,T}  0$ and the hydrogen-bond reorganization that flips the sign of $\\bar{h}_2$, which is consistent with the provided spectroscopic picture.\n\n- Option B: Incorrect. While viscosity increases with pressure and reduces mobilities, the steady-state, zero-flux condition depends on the vanishing of $\\nabla(\\mu_2/T)$ and fixes the ratio of $\\nabla x_2$ to $\\nabla T$. Viscosity and mobilities factor into kinetic coefficients and affect the time to reach steady state and the magnitude of fluxes away from steady state, but not the sign of the steady-state Soret coefficient under the stated conditions. The sign is controlled by the thermodynamic derivatives, dominated here by $\\bar{h}_2$.\n\n- Option C: Incorrect. It asserts the opposite pressure trend for hydrogen bonding and $\\bar{h}_2$ compared to the premise and also claims a sign reversal of $\\left(\\partial (\\mu_2/T)/\\partial x_2\\right)_{p,T}$, which would violate thermodynamic stability (it must remain positive in the single-phase region). Therefore, this option conflicts with both the provided microscopic mechanism and fundamental stability.\n\n- Option D: Incorrect. The partial molar volume $\\bar{v}_2$ enters $d\\mu_2$ via $\\left(\\partial \\mu_2/\\partial p\\right)_{T,x_2} = \\bar{v}_2$, but under the stated isobaric condition with $\\nabla p = 0$, $\\bar{v}_2$ does not contribute directly to the stationary balance that relates $\\nabla x_2$ and $\\nabla T$. Pressure can influence $S_T$ parametrically by changing $\\bar{h}_2$ and the thermodynamic factor, but a decrease of $\\bar{v}_2$ alone at uniform $p$ does not set the sign of $S_T$ nor flip it. Enthalpy, through the Gibbs–Helmholtz relation, directly controls the sign in the stationary state.\n\nTherefore, only Option A is consistent with the fundamental relations and the pressure-induced hydrogen-bonding changes described.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2523409"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the thermodynamic basis for the Soret effect, we now turn to its quantitative prediction in a practical setting.

For a binary mixture, $x_1 + x_2 = 1$. The Soret coefficient, $S_T$, is defined as $S_T = \\frac{D_T}{D}$, with units of inverse temperature.

In a closed system with impermeable boundaries at $z=0$ and $z=L$, the net molar flux of each species must be zero everywhere to conserve mass.

Linearization and Mole Fraction Difference**\n\nWe now linearize this result under the assumption that $|\\lvert S_T \\Delta T \\rvert| \\ll 1$. This implies that the composition variation along the channel is small, so we can approximate $x_1(z) \\approx x_{1,0}$, where $x_{1,0}$ is the initial (and average) mole fraction. We start from the differential form:\n$$\n\\frac{d x_1}{d z} = -S_T x_1(1-x_1) \\frac{d T}{d z}\n$$\nAssuming small variations in $x_1$, the term $x_1(1-x_1)$ can be treated as a constant, $x_{1,0}(1-x_{1,0})$.\n$$\n\\frac{d x_1}{d z} \\approx -S_T x_{1,0}(1-x_{1,0}) \\frac{d T}{d z}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a linear temperature profile. Let us set the cold end at $z=0$ and the hot end at $z=L$. So, $T(0) = T_{\\text{cold}}$ and $T(L) = T_{\\text{hot}} = T_{\\text{cold}} + \\Delta T$.

This leads to the Sturm-Liouville problem for the spatial part:\n$$ X''(x) + \\lambda^2 X(x) = 0, \\quad X'(0) = 0, \\quad X'(L) = 0 $$\nThe eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are found to be:\n$$ \\lambda_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}, \\quad X_n(x) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\quad \\text{for } n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots $$\nThe temporal part gives $\\mathcal{T}_n(t) = \\exp(-D \\lambda_n^2 t) = \\exp\\left(-D \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 t\\right)$.\nThe general solution for the transient part is a superposition of these modes:\n$$ \\theta(x,t) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} C_n \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\exp\\left(-D \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 t\\right) $$\nThe $n=0$ mode corresponds to a constant offset. Due to overall mass conservation, $\\int_0^L \\theta(x,t) dx = 0$ for all $t$, which implies that the coefficient $C_0$ must be zero.\nThe solution for the deviation from steady state is therefore:\n$$ \\theta(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\gamma_n t\\right) $$\nwhere the decay rate for each mode is $\\gamma_n = D \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2$.\n\nThe approach to steady state is governed by the slowest decaying mode, which is the term with the smallest non-zero decay rate. This corresponds to the $n=1$ mode. The leading-order (slowest) decay rate is:\n$$ \\gamma_1 = D \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 $$\nThe characteristic relaxation time is $\\tau_1 = 1/\\gamma_1 = \\frac{L^2}{D \\pi^2}$.\n\nAt long times, the transient deviation is dominated by this slowest mode: $\\theta(x,t) \\approx C_1 \\cos(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}) \\exp(-\\gamma_1 t)$.\nWe are asked to estimate the time $t_{5\\%}$ for the concentration profile to be within $5\\%$ of its steady state value. A standard engineering estimate for this is the time required for the amplitude of the slowest mode to decay to $5\\%$ of its initial value. This means we set the exponential decay term to $0.05$:\n$$ \\exp(-\\gamma_1 t_{5\\%}) = 0.05 $$\nSolving for $t_{5\\%}$:\n$$ t_{5\\%} = -\\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{\\gamma_1} = -\\ln(0.05) \\left( \\frac{L^2}{D \\pi^2} \\right) $$\n\nNow, regarding the influence of the prefactor $x_1 x_2$. The steady-state concentration gradient is $\\frac{\\partial x_{1,ss}}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{D_T G}{D} x_{1,0}x_{2,0}$. This gradient, and thus the magnitude of species separation at steady state, is directly proportional to the linearized prefactor $x_{1,0}x_{2,0}$. However, within the framework of the requested linearization, the relaxation dynamics are governed by the simple diffusion equation. The relaxation time scale $\\tau_1 = \\frac{L^2}{D\\pi^2}$ depends only on the system size $L$ and the molecular diffusivity $D$. It does not depend on the thermodiffusion coefficient $D_T$ or the composition factor $x_{1,0}x_{2,0}$. Therefore, under this approximation, the prefactor affects the final state but not the time scale to reach it.\n\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value for $t_{5\\%}$.\nGiven: $L = 1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{m}$ and $D = 1.00 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{m}^{2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\n$$ t_{5\\%} = -\\ln(0.05) \\frac{(1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{m})^2}{(1.00 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{m}^{2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) \\pi^2} $$\n$$ t_{5\\%} = -\\ln(0.05) \\frac{1.00 \\times 10^{-6}}{1.00 \\times 10^{-9} \\pi^2}\\ \\text{s} = -\\ln(0.05) \\frac{1000}{\\pi^2}\\ \\text{s} $$\nUsing $\\ln(0.05) \\approx -2.99573$ and $\\pi^2 \\approx 9.86960$:\n$$ t_{5\\%} \\approx -(-2.99573) \\times \\frac{1000}{9.86960}\\ \\text{s} \\approx 2.99573 \\times 101.321\\ \\text{s} \\approx 303.533\\ \\text{s} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the estimated time is $304\\ \\text{s}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{304} $$", "id": "2523389"}]}
