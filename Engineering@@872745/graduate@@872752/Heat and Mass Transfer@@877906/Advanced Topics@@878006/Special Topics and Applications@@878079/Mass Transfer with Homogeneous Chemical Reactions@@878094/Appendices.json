It is a standard problem in reaction-diffusion theory and is fully specified with consistent data and boundary conditions. Therefore, we may proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe starting point is the general differential equation for species conservation. For a species $A$, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c_A}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{N}_A = R_A\n$$\nwhere $c_A$ is the molar concentration of species $A$, $t$ is time, $\\mathbf{N}_A$ is the molar flux of $A$, and $R_A$ is the volumetric rate of production of $A$.\n\nWe apply the conditions given in the problem statement:\n1.  The system is at steady state, so all time derivatives are zero: $\\frac{\\partial c_A}{\\partial t} = 0$.\n2.  Transport is one-dimensional in the $y$ direction, so the divergence operator simplifies to $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{N}_A = \\frac{dN_{A,y}}{dy}$.\n3.  There is no bulk flow, so the molar flux $\\mathbf{N}_A$ is described solely by Fick's law of diffusion: $\\mathbf{N}_A = -D \\nabla c_A$. In one dimension, this becomes $N_{A,y} = -D \\frac{dc_A}{dy}$. The diffusivity $D$ is constant.\n4.  The homogeneous reaction rate for species $A$ is explicitly given as $r_A = -k c_A$. The volumetric rate of production, $R_A$, in the species balance equation is equal to this rate. Thus, $R_A = -k c_A$.\n\nSubstituting these conditions into the general conservation equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dy}\\left(-D \\frac{dc_A}{dy}\\right) = -k c_A\n$$\nSince the diffusivity $D$ is constant, we can write the equation as:\n$$\n-D \\frac{d^2c_A}{dy^2} = -k c_A\n$$\nRearranging this gives the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the concentration profile $c_A(y)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2c_A}{dy^2} - \\frac{k}{D} c_A = 0\n$$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is $m^2 - \\frac{k}{D} = 0$, which has roots $m_{1,2} = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}$. The general solution can be written in terms of exponential functions or, more conveniently for this problem, hyperbolic functions:\n$$\nc_A(y) = C_1 \\cosh\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} y\\right) + C_2 \\sinh\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} y\\right)\n$$\nThe constants of integration, $C_1$ and $C_2$, are determined by the boundary conditions:\n1.  At $y=0$, the concentration is $c_A(0) = c_{A0}$.\n2.  At $y=L$, the concentration is $c_A(L) = 0$.\n\nApplying the first boundary condition at $y=0$:\n$$\nc_{A0} = C_1 \\cosh(0) + C_2 \\sinh(0) = C_1 \\cdot 1 + C_2 \\cdot 0 \\implies C_1 = c_{A0}\n$$\nThe solution thus becomes:\n$$\nc_A(y) = c_{A0} \\cosh\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} y\\right) + C_2 \\sinh\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} y\\right)\n$$\nApplying the second boundary condition at $y=L$:\n$$\n0 = c_{A0} \\cosh\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} L\\right) + C_2 \\sinh\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} L\\right)\n$$\nSolving for $C_2$:\n$$\nC_2 = -c_{A0} \\frac{\\cosh\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} L\\right)}{\\sinh\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} L\\right)}\n$$\nSubstituting $C_1$ and $C_2$ back into the solution gives:\n$$\nc_A(y) = c_{A0} \\cosh\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} y\\right) - c_{A0} \\frac{\\cosh\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} L\\right)}{\\sinh\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} L\\right)} \\sinh\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} y\\right)\n$$\nThis expression can be simplified by combining the terms over a common denominator:\n$$\nc_A(y) = \\frac{c_{A0}}{\\sinh\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} L\\right)} \\left[ \\sinh\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} L\\right)\\cosh\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} y\\right) - \\cosh\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} L\\right)\\sinh\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} y\\right) \\right]\n$$\nUsing the hyperbolic identity $\\sinh(a-b) = \\sinh(a)\\cosh(b) - \\cosh(a)\\sinh(b)$, with $a = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}L$ and $b = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}y$, we obtain the final closed-form solution for the concentration profile:\n$$\nc_A(y) = c_{A0} \\frac{\\sinh\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}(L-y)\\right)}{\\sinh\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}L\\right)}\n$$\nNext, we define and interpret the characteristic penetration depth using a dominant-balance argument. The governing ODE is $D \\frac{d^2c_A}{dy^2} - k c_A = 0$. The two terms represent diffusion ($D \\frac{d^2c_A}{dy^2}$) and reaction ($-k c_A$). A characteristic length scale emerges where these two processes are of comparable magnitude. Let $\\delta$ be this characteristic length scale. We can approximate the second derivative as $\\frac{d^2c_A}{dy^2} \\sim \\frac{c_{A0}}{\\delta^2}$ and the concentration as $c_A \\sim c_{A0}$. The balance of the two terms is then:\n$$\nD \\frac{c_{A0}}{\\delta^2} \\sim k c_{A0}\n$$\nSolving for $\\delta$ gives the characteristic penetration depth:\n$$\n\\delta = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}}\n$$\nThe physical meaning of this penetration depth is the characteristic distance over which the diffusing species $A$ can penetrate into the slab before it is significantly consumed by the chemical reaction. It is a measure of the competition between diffusion (which transports the species) and reaction (which consumes it).\n\nThis interpretation is evident from the analytical solution obtained. The arguments of the hyperbolic sine functions are of the form $\\frac{y}{\\delta}$ and $\\frac{L}{\\delta}$. The dimensionless group $\\frac{L}{\\delta} = L\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}$ is known as the Thiele modulus, which compares the rate of reaction to the rate of diffusion.\nIf $L \\ll \\delta$ (reaction is slow or diffusion is fast), then for small $x$, $\\sinh(x) \\approx x$. The concentration profile approaches:\n$$\nc_A(y) \\approx c_{A0} \\frac{\\sqrt{k/D}(L-y)}{\\sqrt{k/D}L} = c_{A0}\\left(1 - \\frac{y}{L}\\right)\n$$\nThis is a linear profile, which is the solution for pure diffusion with no reaction.\nIf $L \\gg \\delta$ (reaction is fast or diffusion is slow), then the reactant is consumed long before it reaches the end of the slab at $y=L$. For large $x$, $\\sinh(x) \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(x)$. The profile becomes:\n$$\nc_A(y) \\approx c_{A0} \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\exp\\left(\\frac{L-y}{\\delta}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{2}\\exp\\left(\\frac{L}{\\delta}\\right)} = c_{A0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y}{\\delta}\\right) = c_{A0} \\exp\\left(-y\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)\n$$\nIn this regime, the concentration decays exponentially from the surface $y=0$ with a characteristic length $\\delta$. The boundary condition at $y=L$ has no influence on the concentration near $y=0$. Thus, $\\delta = \\sqrt{D/k}$ is precisely the length scale that dictates the decay of the concentration profile due to the reaction.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{c_{A0} \\frac{\\sinh\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} (L-y)\\right)}{\\sinh\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} L\\right)}}\n$$", "id": "2503815"}, {"introduction": "Real-world systems rarely conform to simple planar geometries; reactors, catalysts, and biological tissues often have cylindrical or spherical shapes.

A full, reasoned solution will now be developed.\n\nThe starting point is the differential mass balance for species $A$ across the liquid film. Under steady-state conditions, the balance between Fickian diffusion and a first-order chemical reaction within a one-dimensional film is:\n$$ D \\frac{d^2 C_A}{dz^2} - k C_A = 0 $$\nwhere $z$ is the spatial coordinate perpendicular to the interface ($z=0$ at the interface, $z=\\delta$ at the film edge), $C_A$ is the concentration of $A$, $D$ is its diffusivity, and $k$ is the first-order rate constant.

In terms of $Ha$, the enhancement factor becomes:\n$$ E = Ha \\coth(Ha) $$\nThis is the fundamental relationship connecting the enhancement factor to the system properties. The problem provides $E = 7.50$. We must solve the transcendental equation $Ha \\coth(Ha) = 7.50$ for $Ha$. For $Ha \\gtrsim 3$, the reaction is considered fast, and $\\coth(Ha) \\rightarrow 1$.

With both gas- and liquid-side resistances, the flux is given by an overall mass transfer expression:\n$$ N_A = \\frac{p_{A,G} - H C_{A,b}}{\\frac{1}{k_g} + \\frac{H}{E k_L}} $$\nwhere $p_{A,G}$ is the bulk gas partial pressure, $k_g$ is the gas-side mass transfer coefficient, and $H$ is Henry's constant. For physical absorption ($k=0 \\implies E=1$), the flux is $N_A^* = (p_{A,G} - H C_{A,b}) / (1/k_g + H/k_L)$. An experiment measures the *observed* enhancement factor $E_{obs} = N_A/N_A^*$.\n$$ E_{obs} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{k_g} + \\frac{H}{k_L}}{\\frac{1}{k_g} + \\frac{H}{E k_L}} $$\nTo determine the intrinsic rate constant $k$, one must first find the intrinsic enhancement factor $E$ from the measured $E_{obs}$. The equation shows that $E$ depends not only on $E_{obs}$ but also on the relative contributions of the gas- and liquid-side resistances, which are functions of $k_g$, $k_L$, and $H$. If only $E_{obs}$ is measured, and the parameters $k_g$ and $H$ are unknown, it is impossible to uniquely solve for the intrinsic factor $E$. A single measurement of $E_{obs}$ is insufficient to deconvolve the coupled effects of gas-side resistance, liquid-side resistance, and intrinsic reaction kinetics. Therefore, without independent knowledge or measurement of $k_g$ and $H$, the intrinsic rate constant $k$ is not uniquely identifiable from a measured overall enhancement factor.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{15.0}\n$$", "id": "2503840"}]}
