We are given to use the principles of energy conservation, Fourier's law, and continuity conditions at the interface.\n\nFirst, we analyze the heat conduction within the solid coating. The coating occupies the region $-t < y < 0$ and has a constant thermal conductivity $k_s$. For steady-state heat transfer with no volumetric heat generation, the temperature field $T_s(x,y)$ within the coating is governed by the Laplace equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 T_s}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 T_s}{\\partial y^2} = 0\n$$\nThe problem is set in the thin-coating limit, where the thickness $t$ is much smaller than any characteristic length scale in the $x$-direction, which is of the order of the fluid height $H$, i.e., $t \\ll H$. In this limit, an asymptotic analysis shows that heat conduction parallel to the coating surface (in the $x$-direction) is negligible compared to conduction perpendicular to the surface (in the $y$-direction). The term $\\frac{\\partial^2 T_s}{\\partial x^2}$ can be neglected, reducing the governing equation to that of one-dimensional heat conduction:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 T_s}{dy^2} = 0\n$$\nThe general solution to this ordinary differential equation is a linear temperature profile:\n$$\nT_s(y) = C_1 y + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants of integration. These constants are determined by the boundary conditions for the coating.\n\nThe boundary conditions for the temperature field $T_s(y)$ are:\n$1$. At the lower surface of the coating, $y = -t$, it interfaces with a massive substrate maintained at an isothermal temperature $T_b$. Therefore, $T_s(-t) = T_b$.\n$2$. At the upper surface, $y = 0$, the coating is in contact with the fluid. The problem specifies continuity of temperature at this interface. Let the temperature at this interface be denoted by $T_w(x)$, which is equivalent to the fluid temperature at the boundary, $T_f(x, 0^+)$. Thus, the second boundary condition is $T_s(0) = T_w(x) = T_f(x, 0^+)$.\n\nApplying the second boundary condition to the general solution gives:\n$$\nT_s(0) = C_1(0) + C_2 = T_w(x) \\implies C_2 = T_w(x)\n$$\nApplying the first boundary condition gives:\n$$\nT_s(-t) = C_1(-t) + C_2 = T_b\n$$\nSubstituting $C_2 = T_w(x)$ into this equation yields:\n$$\n-C_1 t + T_w(x) = T_b \\implies C_1 = \\frac{T_w(x) - T_b}{t}\n$$\nThus, the temperature distribution within the coating is:\n$$\nT_s(y) = \\frac{T_w(x) - T_b}{t} y + T_w(x)\n$$\nNext, we utilize the condition of continuity of normal heat flux at the fluid–coating interface ($y=0$). Let us define the heat flux from the fluid into the wall, $q_w$, as being positive in the negative $y$-direction. By Fourier's law applied to the fluid at the interface:\n$$\nq_w = k_f \\frac{\\partial T_f}{\\partial y} \\bigg|_{y=0^+}\n$$\nBy energy conservation, this flux must be equal to the heat flux conducted through the coating, also in the negative $y$-direction.

This is of the form $q_w = h_{\\text{eff}}(T_w - T_b)$. The proportionality constant is the effective heat transfer coefficient, $h_{\\text{eff}}$. By comparing the expressions, we identify $h_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$\nh_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{k_s}{t}\n$$\nThis expression depends only on the coating's properties ($k_s$ and $t$), as required. It represents the thermal conductance of the plane wall represented by the coating.\n\nThe final mixed boundary condition on the fluid temperature at $y=0^{+}$ can be written in the standard Robin form by relating the heat flux to the gradient:\n$$\n-k_f \\frac{\\partial T_f}{\\partial y} \\bigg|_{y=0^+} = -q_w = -\\frac{k_s}{t} \\left( T_f(x, 0^+) - T_b \\right) = h_{\\text{eff}} \\left( T_b - T_f(x, 0^+) \\right)\n$$\nAnd the closed-form analytic expression for $h_{\\text{eff}}$ is $\\frac{k_s}{t}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{k_s}{t}}\n$$", "id": "2471278"}, {"introduction": "Building on the analysis of heat flow across interfaces, this exercise explores the conditions under which a multi-dimensional conduction problem within a solid can be reasonably simplified.
