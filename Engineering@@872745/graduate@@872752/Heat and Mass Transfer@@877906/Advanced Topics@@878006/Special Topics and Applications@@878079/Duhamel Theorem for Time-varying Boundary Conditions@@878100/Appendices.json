We are tasked to find the long-time, periodic steady-state response to a sinusoidal temperature forcing at the boundary.

Duhamel's Representation**\n\nDuhamel's principle allows us to construct the solution for a time-varying boundary condition $f(t)$ from the solution for a unit-step boundary condition. Let $u_{\\text{step}}(x,t)$ be the solution for the case where the boundary temperature is a unit step function, $f(t)=1$ for $t>0$. The problem for $u_{\\text{step}}(x,t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u_{\\text{step}}}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^{2} u_{\\text{step}}}{\\partial x^{2}}\n$$\n$$\nu_{\\text{step}}(x,0) = 0, \\quad u_{\\text{step}}(0,t) = 1, \\quad \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} u_{\\text{step}}(x,t) = 0\n$$\nThe solution to this standard problem is given in terms of the complementary error function, $\\text{erfc}$:\n$$\nu_{\\text{step}}(x,t) = \\text{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{\\alpha t}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\text{erfc}(z) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\int_z^\\infty \\exp(-s^2) ds$.\n\nFor a general boundary condition $f(t)$, with $f(0)=0$ (as is the case here, since $f(t)=F_0\\sin(\\omega t)$ and $\\sin(0)=0$), the solution $u(x,t)$ can be constructed by superposition. The time-varying boundary condition is treated as a continuum of infinitesimal step changes. A small step change $df = f'(\\tau)d\\tau$ at time $t=\\tau$ will produce a delayed and scaled response. Summing up all such contributions from $\\tau=0$ to $\\tau=t$ leads to the convolution integral:\n$$\nu(x,t) = \\int_0^t f'(\\tau) u_{\\text{step}}(x,t-\\tau) d\\tau\n$$\nAn equivalent and often more useful form of Duhamel's principle is obtained by integration by parts, which represents the solution as a convolution between the boundary function $f(t)$ and the time derivative of the unit-step response.

Let us first find the solution for a unit step change in the boundary temperature, i.e., $f(t)=1$ for $t>0$. Let this solution be denoted by $\\Theta(x,t)$. The problem for $\\Theta(x,t)$ is:\n$$\\Theta_{t}=\\alpha\\,\\Theta_{xx}$$\n$$\\Theta(x,0)=0, \\quad \\Theta(0,t)=1, \\quad \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\Theta(x,t)=0$$\nThis is a classical problem admitting a similarity solution in terms of the variable $\\eta = \\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{\\alpha t}}$. The solution is given by the complementary error function:\n$$\\Theta(x,t) = \\mathrm{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{\\alpha t}}\\right) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_{x/(2\\sqrt{\\alpha t})}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\xi^2) \\,d\\xi$$\nTo find the heat flux, we require the spatial gradient of the temperature at the surface, $\\Theta_{x}(0^{+},t)$. Using the Leibniz integral rule, we differentiate $\\Theta(x,t)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial\\Theta}{\\partial x} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{\\alpha t}}\\right)^2\\right) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\alpha t}}\\right) \\right] = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi\\alpha t}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{4\\alpha t}\\right)$$\nEvaluating this expression at the surface $x=0^{+}$ gives the surface gradient for the unit step response:\n$$R_{\\text{grad}}(t) \\equiv \\Theta_{x}(0^{+},t) = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi\\alpha t}}$$\nNow, we apply Duhamel's principle (superposition in time) to construct the solution for the general boundary condition $f(t) = g(t) - u_{\\infty}$. We can represent the function $f(t)$ as an initial step of magnitude $f(0^{+})$ occurring at $t=0$, followed by a continuous series of infinitesimal steps of magnitude $f'(\\tau)d\\tau$ at each subsequent time $\\tau \\in (0,t)$.\nThe total response of the surface gradient $\\theta_{x}(0^{+},t)$ is the superposition of the responses to all these steps. By linearity and time-invariance, the response at time $t$ is:\n$$\\theta_{x}(0^{+},t) = f(0^{+}) R_{\\text{grad}}(t) + \\int_{0}^{t} f'(\\tau) R_{\\text{grad}}(t-\\tau) \\,d\\tau$$\nSubstituting $R_{\\text{grad}}(t) = -(\\pi\\alpha t)^{-1/2}$ and $f(t) = g(t) - u_{\\infty}$, we get:\n$$u_{x}(0^{+},t) = \\theta_{x}(0^{+},t) = (g(0^{+})-u_{\\infty})\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi\\alpha t}}\\right) + \\int_{0}^{t} g'(\\tau) \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi\\alpha(t-\\tau)}}\\right) \\,d\\tau$$\n$$u_{x}(0^{+},t) = -\\frac{g(0^{+})-u_{\\infty}}{\\sqrt{\\pi\\alpha t}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi\\alpha}} \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{g'(\\tau)}{\\sqrt{t-\\tau}} \\,d\\tau$$\nThe surface heat flux is $q(0,t)=-k\\,u_{x}(0^{+},t)$:\n$$q(0,t) = \\frac{k(g(0^{+})-u_{\\infty})}{\\sqrt{\\pi\\alpha t}} + \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{\\pi\\alpha}} \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{g'(\\tau)}{\\sqrt{t-\\tau}} \\,d\\tau$$\nThis is the required integral representation for the surface heat flux. The term $g(0^{+})-u_{\\infty}$ is the initial jump $\\Delta = g(0^{+})-g(0^{-})$ specified in the problem, since the initial state implies $g(0^{-}) = u(0,0)=u_{\\infty}$.\n\n### Part 2: Regularity Conditions for Bounded Gradient\n\nWe need to determine the minimal regularity conditions on $g(t)$ such that the surface gradient $u_{x}(0^{+},t)$ remains bounded for all $t>0$. The expression is:\n$$u_{x}(0^{+},t) = -\\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\pi\\alpha t}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi\\alpha}} \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{g'(\\tau)}{\\sqrt{t-\\tau}} \\,d\\tau$$\nWe must analyze the behavior of both terms for $t>0$, particularly as $t \\to 0^{+}$.\nThe first term, $-\\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\pi\\alpha t}}$, is singular at $t=0$. It blows up as $t \\to 0^{+}$ unless its numerator is zero. Therefore, for $u_{x}(0^{+},t)$ to be bounded in any neighborhood of $t=0$, we must have $\\Delta = 0$. This implies $g(0^{+}) - u_{\\infty} = 0$, or $g(0^{+}) = u_{\\infty}$. This means the boundary temperature must be continuous at $t=0$, matching the initial temperature of the solid at the boundary.\n\nIf this condition $\\Delta=0$ is met, the gradient simplifies to:\n$$u_{x}(0^{+},t) = - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi\\alpha}} \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{g'(\\tau)}{\\sqrt{t-\\tau}} \\,d\\tau$$\nThe problem states that $g(t)$ is piecewise continuously differentiable for $t>0$, which implies $g'(\\tau)$ is piecewise continuous and thus bounded on any compact interval $[\\epsilon, T]$ for $\\epsilon>0$. Let's consider the convergence of the integral. If $g'(\\tau)$ is bounded in a neighborhood of $\\tau=0$, i.e., $|g'(\\tau)| \\le M$ for $\\tau \\in (0, t_0]$, then for $t \\in (0, t_0]$:\n$$\\left| \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{g'(\\tau)}{\\sqrt{t-\\tau}} \\,d\\tau \\right| \\le M \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{d\\tau}{\\sqrt{t-\\tau}} = M \\left[-2\\sqrt{t-\\tau}\\right]_{0}^{t} = 2M\\sqrt{t}$$\nThis term is bounded and approaches $0$ as $t\\to 0^{+}$. For any larger $t$, the integral is finite since the singularity of the kernel $(t-\\tau)^{-1/2}$ at $\\tau=t$ is integrable.\nThus, the minimal regularity condition on $g$ in a neighborhood of $t=0$ to ensure $u_{x}(0^{+},t)$ is bounded for $t>0$ is that the jump at $t=0$ must be zero: $\\Delta = g(0^{+}) - u_{\\infty} = 0$.\n\n### Part 3: Short-Time Asymptotic for Heat Flux\n\nWe are asked for the leading-order short-time asymptotic for the surface heat flux $q(0,t)$ as $t \\to 0^{+}$. We are given that there is a jump $\\Delta = g(0^{+})-u_{\\infty}$ at $t=0$, and $g(t)$ is continuously differentiable for $t>0$ with a bounded derivative in a neighborhood of $t=0$.\nThe expression for the flux is:\n$$q(0,t) = \\underbrace{\\frac{k\\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\pi\\alpha t}}}_{\\text{Term 1}} + \\underbrace{\\frac{k}{\\sqrt{\\pi\\alpha}} \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{g'(\\tau)}{\\sqrt{t-\\tau}} \\,d\\tau}_{\\text{Term 2}}$$\nWe analyze the order of magnitude of each term as $t \\to 0^{+}$.\nTerm 1 is of order $O(t^{-1/2})$:\n$$\\text{Term 1} = \\frac{k\\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\pi\\alpha}}t^{-1/2}$$\nFor Term 2, we use the fact that $g'(\\tau)$ is bounded in a neighborhood of $\\tau=0$. Let $|g'(\\tau)| \\le M$ for $\\tau \\in (0, t_0]$. Then, for $t \\to 0^{+}$:\n$$|\\text{Term 2}| = \\left| \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{\\pi\\alpha}} \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{g'(\\tau)}{\\sqrt{t-\\tau}} \\,d\\tau \\right| \\le \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{\\pi\\alpha}} M \\int_{0}^{t} (t-\\tau)^{-1/2} \\,d\\tau = \\frac{k M}{\\sqrt{\\pi\\alpha}} (2\\sqrt{t})$$\nTherefore, Term 2 is of order $O(t^{1/2})$.\nAs $t \\to 0^{+}$, the term of order $O(t^{-1/2})$ is dominant over the term of order $O(t^{1/2})$. The leading-order asymptotic behavior of the surface heat flux is given entirely by the first term, which is the response to the initial jump in temperature.\n$$q(0,t) \\sim \\frac{k\\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\pi\\alpha t}} \\quad \\text{as } t \\to 0^{+}$$\nThis expression gives the short-time asymptotic for the surface heat flux as a function of the specified parameters.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{k\\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\pi\\alpha t}}}\n$$", "id": "2480203"}]}
