It presents a valid inquiry into the fundamental assumptions of the Boussinesq approximation in the context of Rayleigh–Bénard convection. We shall proceed with the derivation and analysis.\n\nThe objective is to derive a dimensionless number that quantifies the relative error introduced by the Boussinesq approximation, specifically by treating the fluid density $\\rho$ as constant in terms where it is not coupled to gravity. The primary equation where this simplification is made is the mass conservation (continuity) equation.\n\nThe exact mass conservation equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\mathbf{u}) = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity field. Expanding the divergence term yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla \\rho + \\rho (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) = 0\n$$\nThe first two terms constitute the material derivative of density, $\\frac{D\\rho}{Dt}$. Thus, the equation can be written as:\n$$\n\\frac{D\\rho}{Dt} + \\rho (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) = 0\n$$\nThe Boussinesq approximation for the continuity equation simplifies this to $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$, which is the condition for an incompressible fluid. This simplification implies that the term $\\frac{D\\rho}{Dt}$ is considered negligible. The error in this approximation is therefore embodied in the non-zero velocity divergence that is being ignored. From the exact equation, this divergence is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{D\\rho}{Dt}\n$$\nTo estimate the magnitude of this term, we must relate the change in density to the change in temperature. The problem specifies the use of the isobaric volumetric thermal expansion coefficient, $\\beta$, defined as:\n$$\n\\beta = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial T}\\right)_P\n$$\nwhere the subscript $P$ indicates constant pressure. The material derivative of density, assuming pressure variations have a negligible effect on density compared to temperature variations (a core tenet of the Boussinesq approximation), is:\n$$\n\\frac{D\\rho}{Dt} \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial T}\\right)_P \\frac{DT}{Dt}\n$$\nwhere $\\frac{DT}{Dt}$ is the material derivative of temperature.

The Boussinesq approximation is valid if this term is small compared to other characteristic velocity gradients, such as shear strain rates. We perform a scaling analysis to find this relative magnitude.\n\nLet $U$ be a characteristic velocity scale, $d$ be the characteristic length scale (the layer thickness), and $\\Delta T$ be the characteristic temperature difference across the layer. The material derivative of temperature is $\\frac{DT}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla T$. In a convection problem, the characteristic time scale is advective, so both terms have the same order of magnitude.

The problem states that the system is in the rapid-rotation regime ($Ta \\gg 1$) and has rigid, isothermal boundaries. For this specific case, the onset of stationary convection is described by a well-established asymptotic scaling law. The critical Rayleigh number scales with the Taylor number to the power of $2/3$:\n$$ Ra_c(Ta) \\approx C \\cdot Ta^{2/3} $$\nThe constant of proportionality, $C$, has been determined through detailed asymptotic analysis and numerical computation. For rigid, perfectly conducting boundaries, the accepted value is $C \\approx 8.696$. Thus, the relation we apply is:\n$$ Ra_c \\approx 8.696 \\cdot Ta^{2/3} $$\nThis scaling law is valid in the limit $Ta \\to \\infty$, and our calculated value $Ta \\approx 6.55 \\times 10^6$ is sufficiently large for this approximation to be accurate.\n\nUsing the unrounded value of $Ta$ for precision, we compute $Ra_c$:\n$$ Ra_c \\approx 8.696 \\times (6,553,600)^{2/3} $$\n$$ Ra_c \\approx 8.696 \\times (35055.57\\dots) $$\n$$ Ra_c \\approx 304,843.0\\dots $$\nRounding this result to three significant figures gives $Ra_c = 3.05 \\times 10^5$.\n\nThe final answer is the ordered pair $(Ta, Ra_c)$, with both values rounded to three significant figures.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{(6.55 \\times 10^{6}, 3.05 \\times 10^{5})} $$", "id": "2519838"}]}
