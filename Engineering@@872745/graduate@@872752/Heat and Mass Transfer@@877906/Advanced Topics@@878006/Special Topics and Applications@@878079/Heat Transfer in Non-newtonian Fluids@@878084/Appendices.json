All provided information, including the constitutive model, flow geometry, boundary conditions, and thermal assumptions, has been extracted and analyzed.\n\n**Validation Verdict:** The problem is deemed **valid**. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of continuum mechanics and heat transfer, an objective and well-posed problem concerning the flow of a non-Newtonian fluid. The assumptions provided are standard for creating a tractable model of a physically realistic situation. Therefore, the derivation of a solution is warranted.\n\nThe solution will be developed in three parts as requested.\n\n**1) Shear Stress Distribution and Plug Radius**\n\nThe analysis begins with the conservation of linear momentum for a steady, fully developed, incompressible, axisymmetric laminar flow in a cylindrical coordinate system ($r, \\theta, z$). Under these conditions, the axial component of the momentum equation simplifies to a balance between pressure and shear forces:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}r}(r\\tau_{rz}) + \\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}z}\\right) = 0 $$\nThe problem defines the constant axial pressure gradient as $G = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}z}$, where $G0$ for flow to occur in the positive $z$-direction. The momentum equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}r}(r\\tau_{rz}) = -Gr $$\nThis ordinary differential equation is integrated with respect to $r$:\n$$ r\\tau_{rz} = -\\frac{Gr^2}{2} + C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration. For a physical solution, the shear stress $\\tau_{rz}$ must be finite at the centerline of the pipe, $r=0$. This requires that $C_1=0$. Thus, the shear stress distribution across the pipe radius is linear:\n$$ \\tau_{rz}(r) = -\\frac{Gr}{2} $$\nThe negative sign indicates the direction of the stress vector. The magnitude of the shear stress is $|\\tau_{rz}| = Gr/2$.\n\nThe Herschel-Bulkley model specifies that the fluid flows as a solid plug when the magnitude of the shear stress is less than the yield stress, $\\tau_0$. The plug region is defined by the condition $|\\tau_{rz}|  \\tau_0$. The fluid is sheared where $|\\tau_{rz}| \\ge \\tau_0$. The plug radius, $r_p$, is the radius at which the shear stress magnitude equals the yield stress.\n$$ |\\tau_{rz}(r_p)| = \\frac{Gr_p}{2} = \\tau_0 $$\nSolving for the plug radius $r_p$ yields:\n$$ r_p = \\frac{2\\tau_0}{G} $$\nThis result indicates that a plug region exists ($r_p  0$) only if the yield stress $\\tau_0$ is non-zero. If the pressure gradient $G$ is insufficient such that $GR/2  \\tau_0$, the plug radius would be larger than the pipe radius, meaning the entire fluid body remains a solid plug and no flow occurs.\n\n**2) Velocity Profile**\n\nThe velocity profile $v_z(r)$ is determined by integrating the appropriate form of the constitutive relation. The profile is piecewise.\n\nFor the plug region, $0 \\le r \\le r_p$, the shear stress is below the yield stress, $|\\tau_{rz}|  \\tau_0$. The constitutive relation dictates that the shear rate is zero:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial r} = 0 $$\nThis implies that the velocity is uniform across the plug region, equal to a constant plug velocity, $v_p$:\n$$ v_z(r) = v_p \\quad \\text{for} \\quad 0 \\le r \\le r_p $$\n\nFor the sheared annulus, $r_p  r \\le R$, the shear stress magnitude exceeds the yield stress, $|\\tau_{rz}| \\ge \\tau_0$. The constitutive relation is:\n$$ |\\tau_{rz}| = \\tau_0 + K \\left| \\frac{\\mathrm{d} v_z}{\\mathrm{d} r} \\right|^n $$\nFrom the momentum balance, $|\\tau_{rz}| = Gr/2$. Since velocity must decrease from the center to the wall for a pressure-driven flow, $\\mathrm{d}v_z/\\mathrm{d}r  0$, so $|\\mathrm{d}v_z/\\mathrm{d}r| = -\\mathrm{d}v_z/\\mathrm{d}r$. Substituting these into the constitutive equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{Gr}{2} = \\tau_0 + K \\left( -\\frac{\\mathrm{d} v_z}{\\mathrm{d} r} \\right)^n $$\nSolving for the velocity gradient:\n$$ -\\frac{\\mathrm{d} v_z}{\\mathrm{d} r} = \\left( \\frac{1}{K} \\left( \\frac{Gr}{2} - \\tau_0 \\right) \\right)^{1/n} $$\nTo find the velocity profile $v_z(r)$ in the sheared region, we integrate this expression from a radial position $r$ to the pipe wall at $R$, applying the no-slip boundary condition $v_z(R)=0$:\n$$ \\int_{v_z(r)}^{v_z(R)=0} \\mathrm{d}v_z = \\int_r^R -\\left( \\frac{1}{K} \\left( \\frac{G r'}{2} - \\tau_0 \\right) \\right)^{1/n} \\mathrm{d}r' $$\n$$ -v_z(r) = -\\left(\\frac{1}{K}\\right)^{1/n} \\int_r^R \\left( \\frac{G r'}{2} - \\tau_0 \\right)^{1/n} \\mathrm{d}r' $$\nThe integration is performed:\n$$ v_z(r) = \\left(\\frac{1}{K}\\right)^{1/n} \\left[ \\frac{(\\frac{G r'}{2} - \\tau_0)^{1/n+1}}{(\\frac{1}{n}+1)(\\frac{G}{2})} \\right]_r^R $$\n$$ v_z(r) = \\left(\\frac{1}{K}\\right)^{1/n} \\frac{2n}{G(n+1)} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{GR}{2} - \\tau_0 \\right)^{(n+1)/n} - \\left( \\frac{Gr}{2} - \\tau_0 \\right)^{(n+1)/n} \\right] $$\nThis expression gives the velocity profile for $r_p \\le r \\le R$.\n\nThe uniform plug velocity, $v_p$, is the velocity at the boundary of the plug, $r=r_p$. We evaluate $v_z(r_p)$ using the derived profile:\n$$ v_p = v_z(r_p) = \\left(\\frac{1}{K}\\right)^{1/n} \\frac{2n}{G(n+1)} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{GR}{2} - \\tau_0 \\right)^{(n+1)/n} - \\left( \\frac{Gr_p}{2} - \\tau_0 \\right)^{(n+1)/n} \\right] $$\nSince $r_p = 2\\tau_0/G$, the term $(Gr_p/2 - \\tau_0)$ is equal to zero. Therefore, the plug velocity simplifies to:\n$$ v_p = \\left(\\frac{1}{K}\\right)^{1/n} \\frac{2n}{G(n+1)} \\left( \\frac{GR}{2} - \\tau_0 \\right)^{(n+1)/n} $$\n\n**3) Qualitative Discussion of Convective Heat Transfer**\n\nThe analysis considers the implications of the plug region ($r_p  0$) on heat transfer, compared to a purely shear-thinning power-law fluid ($\\tau_0 = 0$) under the same pressure gradient $G$ and wall heat flux $\\dot{q}''$. The steady-state energy equation for axisymmetric flow with negligible axial conduction and viscous dissipation is:\n$$ \\rho c_p v_z(r) \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z} = \\frac{k}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r} \\right) $$\nFor a thermally fully developed flow with constant wall heat flux, $\\partial T/\\partial z$ is constant.\n\n- **Effect on Near-Wall Gradients and Velocity Profile:** The velocity profile for a Herschel-Bulkley fluid is blunter than for a power-law fluid. The presence of a yield stress $\\tau_0$ adds resistance to flow, so for a fixed pressure gradient $G$, the mean velocity and total flow rate are lower than in the $\\tau_0=0$ case. The velocity gradient at the wall ($r=R$) is given by $-\\frac{\\mathrm{d} v_z}{\\mathrm{d} r}|_R = \\left( \\frac{1}{K} ( \\frac{GR}{2} - \\tau_0 ) \\right)^{1/n}$. This is smaller than the gradient for a power-law fluid, which is $\\left( \\frac{1}{K} \\frac{GR}{2} \\right)^{1/n}$. The constant wall heat flux condition, $\\dot{q}'' = -k(\\partial T/\\partial r)|_{r=R}$, fixes the thermal gradient at the wall, irrespective of the fluid type.\n\n- **Effect on Fully Developed Nusselt Number ($Nu$):** The Nusselt number is defined as $Nu = hD/k$, where the heat transfer coefficient is $h = \\dot{q}'' / (T_w - T_b)$, with $T_w$ being the wall temperature and $T_b$ the bulk mean temperature. For fixed $\\dot{q}''$, $D$, and $k$, the Nusselt number is inversely proportional to the temperature difference $T_w - T_b$. The central plug region ($0 \\le r \\le r_p$) is characterized by a uniform velocity and zero shear rate. In this region, there is no relative motion between adjacent fluid layers, so radial heat transfer occurs purely by conduction. This lack of convective mixing in the core impedes the transport of heat away from the wall region toward the centerline. Consequently, to transfer the same amount of heat $\\dot{q}''$, a larger temperature difference between the wall and the bulk fluid is required. A larger $(T_w - T_b)$ signifies a lower heat transfer coefficient $h$ and therefore a lower fully developed Nusselt number. The presence of a finite plug region degrades the overall heat transfer performance compared to a purely shearing flow.\n\n- **Effect on Thermal Entrance Length ($L_{th}$):** The thermal entrance length is the axial distance required for the thermal boundary layer to develop fully, at which point the Nusselt number becomes constant. This length is proportional to the fluid's capacity to transport energy axially relative to its ability to diffuse it radially. A common scaling is $L_{th} \\propto \\bar{v} D^2 / \\alpha$, where $\\bar{v}$ is the mean velocity and $\\alpha = k/(\\rho c_p)$ is the thermal diffusivity. This can be expressed as $L_{th}/D \\propto Re \\cdot Pr$. For a given pressure gradient $G$, the presence of yield stress $\\tau_0$ increases the resistance to flow, resulting in a lower mean velocity $\\bar{v}$ compared to the case where $\\tau_0=0$. A lower mean velocity translates to a lower Reynolds number ($Re$). Since the thermal entrance length is approximately proportional to the Reynolds number in laminar flow, the presence of a plug region leads to a shorter thermal entrance length.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2\\tau_0}{GR}}\n$$", "id": "2494582"}, {"introduction": "Building on the foundational skill of deriving velocity profiles, this practice introduces two new elements: the versatile power-law fluid model and the concept of Navier slip at the wall.

State the corresponding boundary conditions in terms of $\\theta$.\n- Impose the kinematic constraint implied by the plate velocities, $\\int_{-H}^{H} \\dot{\\gamma}(y)\\,dy = 2U$, to obtain a second relation coupling the uniform shear stress $\\tau$ and the temperature field through an integral of $\\theta$.\n- Use an appropriate stress scale based on $m_w$, $U$, and $H$ to eliminate $\\tau$ in favor of a dimensionless stress, and show that the coupled problem can be written in terms of a minimal set of non-dimensional groups. Explain qualitatively, using monotonicity and intersection arguments, how the nonlinear coupling between temperature-dependent viscosity and viscous dissipation can give rise to multiple steady solutions for the same dimensional inputs $(U,H,m_w,\\beta,k,n)$.\n\nWhich option correctly identifies the minimal set of controlling non-dimensional groups for this configuration and describes their role in enabling multiplicity?\n\nA.

Integrating with respect to $y$ shows that the shear stress is uniform across the channel:\n$$ \\tau_{xy}(y) = \\tau = \\text{constant} $$\nThe velocity profile $u(y)$ must be an odd function due to the symmetric geometry and boundary conditions, i.e., $u(-y) = -u(y)$. This implies $u(0)=0$. Since $u(H)=U0$, the velocity gradient (shear rate) $\\dot{\\gamma}(y) = \\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$ must be positive everywhere, so $\\mathrm{sgn}(\\partial u/\\partial y)=1$ and $|\\partial u/\\partial y| = \\partial u/\\partial y = \\dot{\\gamma}$. The constitutive relation simplifies to:\n$$ \\tau = m(T) \\dot{\\gamma}^n $$\nSolving for the local shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}(y)$:\n$$ \\dot{\\gamma}(y) = \\left(\\frac{\\tau}{m(T)}\\right)^{1/n} $$\nThe viscous dissipation function $\\Phi(y)$ is given by $\\Phi = \\tau_{xy} \\dot{\\gamma}$. Substituting the expressions for $\\tau_{xy}$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}$:\n$$ \\Phi(y) = \\tau \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\tau}{m(T)}\\right)^{1/n} = \\frac{\\tau^{(n+1)/n}}{m(T)^{1/n}} $$\n\n**Non-Dimensionalization and Energy Equation**\nWe introduce the dimensionless coordinate $Y = y/H$. To eliminate $\\beta$ from the exponent in $m(T)$, we define a dimensionless temperature $\\theta$ as:\n$$ \\theta(Y) = \\beta (T(y) - T_w) $$\nWith this definition, the consistency becomes $m(T) = m_w \\exp(-\\theta)$. The energy equation is $k\\,\\dfrac{d^2 T}{dy^2} + \\Phi = 0$. We transform the derivatives: $T = T_w + \\theta/\\beta$, so $\\dfrac{d^2T}{dy^2} = \\dfrac{1}{\\beta H^2}\\dfrac{d^2\\theta}{dY^2}$. Substituting this and the expression for $\\Phi$ into the energy equation:\n$$ \\frac{k}{\\beta H^2} \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dY^2} + \\frac{\\tau^{(n+1)/n}}{(m_w e^{-\\theta})^{1/n}} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dY^2} + \\frac{\\beta H^2 \\tau^{(n+1)/n}}{k m_w^{1/n}} e^{\\theta/n} = 0 $$\nThe boundary conditions become $\\theta(\\pm 1) = \\beta(T_w - T_w) = 0$ and, by symmetry, $\\dfrac{d\\theta}{dY}\\bigg|_{Y=0}=0$.\n\n**Kinematic Constraint**\nThe total change in velocity across the gap is given by the integral of the shear rate:\n$$ \\int_{-H}^{H} \\dot{\\gamma}(y)\\,dy = u(H) - u(-H) = U - (-U) = 2U $$\nSubstituting $\\dot{\\gamma}(y)$ and non-dimensionalizing ($y=HY, dy=HdY$):\n$$ \\int_{-1}^{1} \\left(\\frac{\\tau}{m(T(Y))}\\right)^{1/n} H\\,dY = 2U $$\n$$ H \\left(\\frac{\\tau}{m_w}\\right)^{1/n} \\int_{-1}^{1} e^{\\theta(Y)/n}\\,dY = 2U $$\n\n**Final Dimensionless Form and Multiplicity**\nTo eliminate the unknown stress $\\tau$, we introduce a dimensionless stress $\\widehat{\\tau}$ scaled with a characteristic stress for isothermal flow, $\\tau_{char} = m_w(U/H)^n$.\n$$ \\widehat{\\tau} = \\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_{char}} = \\frac{\\tau}{m_w(U/H)^n} $$\nWe now rewrite the two main relations in terms of $\\widehat{\\tau}$.\nFrom the kinematic constraint:\n$$ H \\left(\\frac{\\widehat{\\tau} m_w (U/H)^n}{m_w}\\right)^{1/n} \\int_{-1}^{1} e^{\\theta(Y)/n}\\,dY = 2U $$\n$$ H \\widehat{\\tau}^{1/n} \\frac{U}{H} \\int_{-1}^{1} e^{\\theta(Y)/n}\\,dY = 2U $$\n$$ \\widehat{\\tau}^{1/n} \\int_{-1}^{1} e^{\\theta(Y)/n}\\,dY = 2 $$\nSince $\\theta(Y)$ is an even function, the integral from $-1$ to $1$ is twice the integral from $0$ to $1$. Thus, $\\widehat{\\tau}^{1/n} \\cdot 2 \\int_{0}^{1} e^{\\theta(Y)/n}\\,dY = 2$, which simplifies to:\n$$ \\widehat{\\tau}^{-1/n} = \\int_{0}^{1} e^{\\theta(Y)/n}\\,dY $$\nNext, we rewrite the parameter group in the energy equation. Let $\\Lambda = \\dfrac{\\beta H^2 \\tau^{(n+1)/n}}{k m_w^{1/n}}$. Substitute $\\tau = \\widehat{\\tau} m_w (U/H)^n$:\n$$ \\Lambda = \\frac{\\beta H^2}{k m_w^{1/n}} \\left(\\widehat{\\tau} m_w (U/H)^n\\right)^{(n+1)/n} = \\frac{\\beta H^2}{k m_w^{1/n}} \\widehat{\\tau}^{(n+1)/n} m_w^{(n+1)/n} (U/H)^{n+1} $$\n$$ \\Lambda = \\left(\\frac{\\beta m_w U^{n+1} H^{1-n}}{k}\\right) \\widehat{\\tau}^{(n+1)/n} $$\nThe problem can be further simplified. Let us re-scale the temperature as $\\phi = \\theta/n$. The energy equation becomes:\n$$ n \\frac{d^2\\phi}{dY^2} + \\left(\\frac{\\beta m_w U^{n+1} H^{1-n}}{k}\\right) \\widehat{\\tau}^{(n+1)/n} e^{\\phi} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\phi}{dY^2} + \\left(\\frac{\\beta m_w U^{n+1} H^{1-n}}{nk}\\right) \\widehat{\\tau}^{(n+1)/n} e^{\\phi} = 0 $$\nLet us define the dimensionless thermo-viscous coupling parameter $\\Pi$ as presented in option A:\n$$ \\Pi = \\frac{\\beta m_w U^{n+1} H^{1-n}}{nk} $$\nThe energy equation is now a boundary-value problem for $\\phi(Y)$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\phi}{dY^2} + \\left( \\Pi \\widehat{\\tau}^{(n+1)/n} \\right) e^{\\phi} = 0, \\quad \\text{with } \\phi(1)=0 \\text{ and } \\frac{d\\phi}{dY}(0)=0 $$\nThe solution to this BVP, $\\phi(Y)$, depends only on the combined parameter group $Z \\equiv \\Pi \\widehat{\\tau}^{(n+1)/n}$. Thus, $\\phi = \\phi(Y; Z)$.\nThe kinematic constraint becomes, in terms of $\\phi$:\n$$ \\widehat{\\tau}^{-1/n} = \\int_{0}^{1} e^{\\phi(Y; Z)}\\,dY $$\nIf we define a function $F(Z) = \\int_{0}^{1} e^{\\phi(Y; Z)}\\,dY$, the final implicit equation for $\\widehat{\\tau}$ is:\n$$ \\widehat{\\tau}^{-1/n} = F\\left(\\Pi \\widehat{\\tau}^{(n+1)/n}\\right) $$\nThe controlling parameters that define a specific problem instance are $\\Pi$ and $n$. For a fixed set of dimensional inputs, $\\Pi$ and $n$ are fixed. The value of $\\widehat{\\tau}$ must be found by solving this implicit equation.\nThe multiplicity of solutions arises from the non-linear nature of this system. It is a known result for this class of problems (related to the Frank-Kamenetskii theory of thermal explosion) that a plot of the response variable ($\\widehat{\\tau}$) versus the driving parameter ($\\Pi$) is S-shaped. For a range of $\\Pi$ values ($\\Pi_{min}  \\Pi  \\Pi_{max}$), a single value of $\\Pi$ corresponds to three possible values of $\\widehat{\\tau}$. Each value of $\\widehat{\\tau}$ represents a distinct steady-state solution (with its own velocity and temperature profile). This S-shaped relationship arises from the strong feedback loop: higher velocity $\\to$ more viscous heating $\\to$ higher temperature $\\to$ lower viscosity $\\to$ modified velocity profile.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. A single thermo-viscous coupling parameter $\\Pi \\equiv \\dfrac{\\beta\\,m_w\\,U^{\\,n+1}\\,H^{\\,1-n}}{n\\,k}$ together with the flow behavior index $n$. After scaling the stress by $m_w\\left(U/H\\right)^{n}$, the steady problem collapses to an implicit algebraic relation $\\widehat{\\tau}^{-1/n} = F\\!\\left(\\Pi\\,\\widehat{\\tau}^{(n+1)/n}\\right)$, where $F(\\cdot)$ arises from the solution of the dimensionless temperature boundary-value problem. For sufficiently large $\\Pi$ (depending on $n$), this relation becomes $S$-shaped in $\\widehat{\\tau}$, producing up to three steady states for the same dimensional inputs.**\nThis option correctly identifies the controlling dimensionless group $\\Pi$ and the flow index $n$. The stress scaling is correct. The derived implicit algebraic relation $\\widehat{\\tau}^{-1/n} = F(\\Pi \\widehat{\\tau}^{(n+1)/n})$ matches our derivation precisely (with a slight difference in the integration limits of F, being from 0 to 1 versus the symmetric form, which is just a factor of 2). The qualitative explanation for multiplicity, invoking the S-shaped response curve which yields multiple $\\widehat{\\tau}$ values for a given $\\Pi$, is correct. The phrasing \"S-shaped in $\\widehat{\\tau}$\" is slightly imprecise but correctly captures the essence of a multi-valued solution for $\\widehat{\\tau}$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The Reynolds number $\\mathrm{Re}$ and the Prandtl number $\\mathrm{Pr}$ alone. Multiple steady states arise only when $\\mathrm{Re}\\,\\mathrm{Pr}$ is sufficiently large due to strong convective transport overcoming diffusion.**\nThis is incorrect. The problem explicitly assumes negligible inertia, which corresponds to the limit $\\mathrm{Re} \\to 0$. Therefore, $\\mathrm{Re}$ cannot be a controlling parameter. The multiplicity arises from the non-linear coupling between viscous heating and temperature-dependent viscosity, not from convection, which is largely neglected in this formulation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The Graetz number $\\mathrm{Gz}$ and the Nusselt number $\\mathrm{Nu}$ alone. Multiple steady states occur when $\\mathrm{Gz}$ is small and $\\mathrm{Nu}$ is large so that wall heat removal competes with axial development.**\nThis is incorrect. The Graetz number is relevant for thermal entry-length problems. The assumption $\\partial T/\\partial x = 0$ means the problem is considered infinitely far downstream, i.e., it is thermally fully developed, making $\\mathrm{Gz}$ irrelevant. The Nusselt number is a calculated output (a dimensionless result), not an input parameter that controls the existence of multiple solutions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. A single Brinkman number $\\mathrm{Br}\\equiv \\mu\\,U^{2}/(k\\,\\Delta T)$ with no dependence on viscosity–temperature sensitivity or on $n$. Multiplicity occurs whenever $\\mathrm{Br}$ exceeds a universal critical value independent of the rheology and boundary conditions.**\nThis is incorrect. The given Brinkman number is for a Newtonian fluid and depends on an a priori unknown temperature difference $\\Delta T$. More fundamentally, it omits the temperature-sensitivity parameter $\\beta$, which is essential for the feedback mechanism that creates multiple solutions. If $\\beta=0$, viscosity is constant, the problem becomes linear, and the solution is unique. Furthermore, the analysis shows a clear and crucial dependence on the flow behavior index $n$. The existence and range of multiplicity are not independent of the rheology.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2494606"}]}
