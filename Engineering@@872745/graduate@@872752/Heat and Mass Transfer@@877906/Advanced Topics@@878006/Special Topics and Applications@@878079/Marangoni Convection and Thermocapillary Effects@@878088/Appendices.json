We derive this by considering the force balance on an infinitesimal fluid element located at the interface.\n\nThe gradient in surface tension $\\sigma$ creates a tangential force per unit area on the interface, known as the Marangoni stress. For the given $2\\mathrm{D}$ case, this stress is $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x}$. In a steady state, this force must be balanced by the viscous shear stress exerted by the liquid just below the interface, $\\tau_{xy}|_{y=h}$. This gives the general tangential stress balance at the interface:\n$$\\tau_{xy}|_{y=h} = \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x}$$\nHere, $\\tau_{xy}$ is the shear stress component in the liquid at the interface. For an incompressible Newtonian fluid, the shear stress tensor component is given by:\n$$\\tau_{xy} = \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} \\right)$$\nSubstituting this into the balance gives:\n$$\\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} \\right)\\bigg|_{y=h} = \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x}$$\nThis is the complete tangential stress balance.

The onset of thermocapillary convection occurs when the Marangoni number $\\mathrm{Ma}$ exceeds a critical value, $\\mathrm{Ma}_c$.

Derivation of the Affine Approximation for $\\mathrm{Ma}_c(\\mathrm{Ra})$**\n\nThe onset of stationary convection in a fluid layer heated from below is determined by a balance between destabilizing thermal effects (buoyancy and thermocapillarity) and stabilizing diffusive effects (viscous and thermal). For stationary onset, when heating from below ($\\Delta T > 0$), both buoyancy and thermocapillarity act in concert to destabilize the quiescent state. The simplest model for their combined effect is to assume their contributions to instability are additive. This means the system becomes unstable when a linear combination of the normalized driving parameters exceeds a threshold of unity.\n\nThe neutral stability condition can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{Ra}}{\\mathrm{Ra}_{c0}} + \\frac{\\mathrm{Ma}}{\\mathrm{Ma}_{c0}} = 1\n$$\nHere, $\\mathrm{Ra}_{c0}$ and $\\mathrm{Ma}_{c0}$ are the critical values for pure buoyancy-driven convection ($\\mathrm{Ma}=0$) and pure thermocapillary-driven convection ($\\mathrm{Ra}=0$), respectively. This linear relationship satisfies the problem's endpoint constraints.
