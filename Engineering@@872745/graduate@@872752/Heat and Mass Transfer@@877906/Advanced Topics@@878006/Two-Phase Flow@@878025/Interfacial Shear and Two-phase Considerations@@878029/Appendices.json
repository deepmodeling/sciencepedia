Given that gravity is negligible and there is no imposed pressure gradient, the $x$-component of the Navier-Stokes equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{yx}}{\\partial y} = 0 $$\nwhere $\\tau_{yx}$ is the shear stress. Since the flow is assumed to be a function only of the coordinate $y$, the partial derivative becomes an ordinary derivative:\n$$ \\frac{d\\tau_{yx}}{dy} = 0 $$\nThis equation holds true within each fluid layer. Integrating this equation implies that the shear stress $\\tau_{yx}$ must be a constant throughout the entire domain, from $y=0$ to $y=h_1+h_2$. Let us denote this constant shear stress as $\\tau$. The problem specifies that the tangential viscous shear stress is continuous across the interface at $y=h_1$, which is consistent with our finding that $\\tau$ is constant everywhere. The interfacial shear stress, $\\tau_i$, is therefore equal to this constant, $\\tau_i = \\tau$.\n\nThe fluids are Newtonian, so the shear stress is related to the velocity gradient by the constitutive relation:\n$$ \\tau_{yx} = \\mu \\frac{du}{dy} $$\nWe apply this relation to each fluid layer.

Let us non-dimensionalize the numerator and denominator of the expression for $C_0$.\nThe denominator is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta}{\\mu_1} + \\frac{H-\\delta}{\\mu_2} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_1}\\left(\\delta + \\frac{H-\\delta}{m}\\right) = \\frac{H}{\\mu_1}\\left(\\phi + \\frac{1-\\phi}{m}\\right) = \\frac{H}{\\mu_1 m}(1 - \\phi + m\\phi)\n$$\nThe numerator is:\n$$\n(U_H-U_0) + \\frac{G}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\delta^2}{\\mu_1} + \\frac{H^2-\\delta^2}{m}\\right) = \\frac{G H^2}{\\mu_1} S + \\frac{G}{2\\mu_1}\\left(\\delta^2 + \\frac{H^2-\\delta^2}{m}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{G H^2}{\\mu_1}S + \\frac{G H^2}{2\\mu_1}\\left(\\phi^2 + \\frac{1-\\phi^2}{m}\\right) = \\frac{G H^2}{\\mu_1 m}\\left(mS + \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\phi^2 + m\\phi^2)\\right)\n$$\nNow we compute $y_0/H = C_0/(GH)$:\n$$\n\\frac{y_0}{H} = \\frac{1}{GH} C_0 = \\frac{1}{GH} \\frac{\\frac{G H^2}{\\mu_1 m}\\left(mS + \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\phi^2 + m\\phi^2)\\right)}{\\frac{H}{\\mu_1 m}(1 - \\phi + m\\phi)}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{y_0}{H} = \\frac{mS + \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\phi^2 + m\\phi^2)}{1 - \\phi + m\\phi} = \\frac{2mS + 1 - \\phi^2 + m\\phi^2}{2(1 - \\phi + m\\phi)}\n$$\nThis can be written in a more structured form:\n$$\n\\frac{y_0}{H} = \\frac{1 - \\phi^2 + m(2S + \\phi^2)}{2(1 - \\phi + m\\phi)}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression.\n\nFor the interpretation, first we examine the dependence of $y_0/H$ on the viscosity ratio $m$. Let $f(m) = y_0/H$. We take the derivative with respect to $m$ while holding $\\phi$ and $S$ constant:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dm}\\left(\\frac{y_0}{H}\\right) = \\frac{d}{dm}\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1 - \\phi^2 + m(2S + \\phi^2)}{1 - \\phi + m\\phi}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{(2S+\\phi^2)(1-\\phi+m\\phi) - (1-\\phi^2+m(2S+\\phi^2))(\\phi)}{(1-\\phi+m\\phi)^2}\n$$\nThe numerator simplifies to $(2S+\\phi^2)(1-\\phi) - (1-\\phi^2)\\phi = (1-\\phi)[(2S+\\phi^2) - (1+\\phi)\\phi] = (1-\\phi)(2S-\\phi)$.\nSince $0  \\phi  1$, the term $(1-\\phi)$ is positive. The denominator is a square and is also positive. Thus, the sign of the derivative is determined by the sign of $(2S-\\phi)$.\nIf $2S  \\phi$, $y_0/H$ increases as $m$ increases.\nIf $2S  \\phi$, $y_0/H$ decreases as $m$ increases.\nIf $2S = \\phi$, $y_0/H = (1+\\phi)/2$ and is independent of $m$.\n\nSecond, we explain the sign of the interfacial shear, $\\tau(\\delta)$. The shear stress profile is $\\tau(y) = G(y_0 - y)$. At the interface $y=\\delta$:\n$$\n\\tau(\\delta) = G(y_0 - \\delta)\n$$\nSince $G$ is a positive constant, the sign of $\\tau(\\delta)$ is identical to the sign of $(y_0 - \\delta)$.\n- If $y_0  \\delta$, the plane of zero shear is in the upper fluid. Then $\\tau(\\delta)  0$. This signifies that the lower, more slowly moving region of fluid $1$ exerts a positive (downstream) shear force on the upper fluid $2$ at the interface.\n- If $y_0  \\delta$, the plane of zero shear is in the lower fluid. Then $\\tau(\\delta)  0$. This signifies that the upper, more rapidly moving region of fluid $2$ exerts a negative (upstream) shear force on the lower fluid $1$ at the interface.\n- If $y_0 = \\delta$, the shear stress is zero at the interface, $\\tau(\\delta)=0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1 - \\phi^2 + m(2S + \\phi^2)}{2(1 - \\phi + m\\phi)}}\n$$", "id": "2496261"}]}
