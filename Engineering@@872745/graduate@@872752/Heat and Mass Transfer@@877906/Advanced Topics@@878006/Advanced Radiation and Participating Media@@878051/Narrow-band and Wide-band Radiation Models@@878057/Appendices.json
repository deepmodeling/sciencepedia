For a homogeneous gas layer of path length $L$ with a uniform number density of absorbing molecules $n$, the optical depth is given by $\\tau(\\tilde{\\nu}) = \\kappa(\\tilde{\\nu}) L$, where $\\kappa(\\tilde{\\nu})$ is the spectral absorption coefficient. The problem deals with a column density, which we denote as $U = L n$.\n\nThe absorption coefficient $\\kappa(\\tilde{\\nu})$ is the product of the line strength per molecule $S$, the number density $n$, and the line shape function $g(\\tilde{\\nu})$. For a band composed of many lines centered at wavenumbers $\\tilde{\\nu}_i$, the total absorption coefficient is the sum over all lines:\n$$\n\\kappa(\\tilde{\\nu}) = n \\sum_i S_i g(\\tilde{\\nu}-\\tilde{\\nu}_i)\n$$\nAs per the problem statement, all lines have the same strength $S_i = S$. Thus, the optical depth for a path with column density $U = L n$ is:\n$$\n\\tau(\\tilde{\\nu}) = U S \\sum_i g(\\tilde{\\nu}-\\tilde{\\nu}_i)\n$$\nThe Lorentz line shape function, normalized such that $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g(\\tilde{\\nu})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\tilde{\\nu}=1$, is given by:\n$$\ng(\\tilde{\\nu}) = \\frac{\\gamma/\\pi}{\\tilde{\\nu}^2 + \\gamma^2}\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the half-width at half-maximum.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the \"strong-overlap limit\", which is specified to occur when the line half-width $\\gamma$ is of the same order as the mean line spacing $d$. In this limit, the spectral features of individual lines are smeared out due to extensive overlapping. The rapidly oscillating function $\\kappa(\\tilde{\\nu})$ can be replaced by its average value over the spectral interval, $\\bar{\\kappa}$. The problem provides a direct hint for this: \"the period-average of a periodic sum of Lorentzians equals the line density\". This implies that the correct average absorption coefficient is the total line strength per unit wavenumber, which is the strength of one line $S$ divided by the mean spacing $d$.\n\nLet us formally demonstrate this. The average absorption coefficient over a spectral interval of width $d$ is:\n$$\n\\bar{\\kappa} = \\frac{1}{d} \\int_{\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}=d} \\kappa(\\tilde{\\nu}) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{U S}{L d} \\int_{\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}=d} \\sum_i g(\\tilde{\\nu}-\\tilde{\\nu}_i) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\tilde{\\nu}\n$$\nOn average, there is one line in the interval of width $d$. If we extend the integral over a much larger interval $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{large} \\gg d$ containing many lines, the average becomes:\n$$\n\\bar{\\kappa} = \\frac{U S}{L \\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{large}} \\int_{\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{large}} \\sum_i g(\\tilde{\\nu}-\\tilde{\\nu}_i) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx \\frac{U S}{L \\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{large}} \\sum_i \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g(\\tilde{\\nu}-\\tilde{\\nu}_i) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\tilde{\\nu}\n$$\nSince each line is normalized, $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g(\\tilde{\\nu}-\\tilde{\\nu}_i) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\tilde{\\nu}=1$. The number of lines in the interval $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{large}$ is approximately $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{large}/d$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\bar{\\kappa} \\approx \\frac{U S}{L \\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{large}} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{large}}{d} \\right) = \\frac{U S}{L d} = \\frac{n S}{d}\n$$\nThe average spectral optical depth $\\bar{\\tau}$ is then constant over the band:\n$$\n\\bar{\\tau} = \\bar{\\kappa} L = \\left(\\frac{n S}{d}\\right) L = \\frac{S \\cdot (L n)}{d}\n$$\nWith a constant optical depth, the monochromatic transmittance $\\mathcal{T}(\\tilde{\\nu})$ also becomes constant, $\\bar{\\mathcal{T}} = \\exp(-\\bar{\\tau})$.\n\nNow we can compute the equivalent width $W$ using its definition for an interval of width $d$:\n$$\nW = \\int_{\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}=d} \\big(1 - \\mathcal{T}(\\tilde{\\nu})\\big)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\tilde{\\nu}\n$$\nSubstituting the constant transmittance $\\bar{\\mathcal{T}}$ from the strong-overlap approximation:\n$$\nW \\approx \\int_{\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}=d} (1 - \\bar{\\mathcal{T}}) \\,\\mathrm{d}\\tilde{\\nu} = (1 - \\bar{\\mathcal{T}}) \\int_{\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}=d} \\mathrm{d}\\tilde{\\nu} = d(1 - \\bar{\\mathcal{T}})\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\bar{\\mathcal{T}}$, we arrive at the closed-form approximation for the equivalent width in the strong-overlap limit:\n$$\nW = d \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{S \\cdot L n}{d}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThis expression is the required result for the Goody statistical model in this limit.\n\nNext, we compare this to the prediction from the Elsasser model, which assumes a regular, periodic array of lines. The absorption coefficient for the Elsasser model is a periodic function, and its average value over one period $d$ is precisely the line density, $\\bar{\\kappa}_{\\text{Elsasser}} = S/d$. In the strong-overlap limit, the spectral oscillations of the Elsasser absorption coefficient are heavily damped, and the coefficient approaches its mean value, $S/d$, everywhere. Consequently, the optical depth and transmittance become uniform, and the resulting equivalent width is identical to that derived above. Both models converge to the same result because the specific arrangement of lines (random versus regular) becomes irrelevant when they are sufficiently broadened to merge into a continuous absorption feature.\n\nFinally, we perform the numerical evaluation using the provided data:\n$S = 3 \\times 10^{-22}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{molecule}^{-1}$\n$\\gamma = 0.1\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n$d = 0.1\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n$L\\,n = 5 \\times 10^{21}\\ \\mathrm{molecules/cm}^{2}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the average optical depth, $\\bar{\\tau}$:\n$$\n\\bar{\\tau} = \\frac{S \\cdot L n}{d} = \\frac{(3 \\times 10^{-22}) \\cdot (5 \\times 10^{21})}{0.1} = \\frac{1.5}{0.1} = 15\n$$\nThis is a dimensionless quantity.
