It is therefore deemed **valid**. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe overall heat transfer coefficient, $U$, is a function of the random variables $k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_N$. The function is given by:\n$$\nU(\\mathbf{k}) = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{t_i}{k_i} \\right)^{-1}\n$$\nThe First-Order Second-Moment (FOSM) method approximates the variance of a function $Y = f(X_1, \\dots, X_N)$ using a first-order Taylor series expansion of the function about the mean values of the input variables $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{\\mathbf{X}} = (\\mu_{X_1}, \\dots, \\mu_{X_N})^{\\top}$.

We substitute this expression into the equation for $T_m$:\n$$\nT_m(\\xi) = \\frac{T_L + (\\mu_0 + \\sigma_0 \\xi)}{2} = \\frac{T_L + \\mu_0}{2} + \\frac{\\sigma_0}{2} \\xi\n$$\nThis shows that $T_m$ is a linear function of the random variable $\\xi$. We are asked to construct a second-order Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) for $T_m$:\n$$\nT_m(\\xi) \\approx c_0 \\psi_0(\\xi) + c_1 \\psi_1(\\xi) + c_2 \\psi_2(\\xi)\n$$\nThe coefficients $c_j$ are determined via the Galerkin projection method. Due to the orthonormality of the Hermite polynomials $\\psi_j$ with respect to the standard normal probability measure, the coefficients are given by the expectation:\n$$\nc_j = \\mathbb{E}[T_m(\\xi) \\psi_j(\\xi)]\n$$\nWe compute each coefficient systematically.\nFor $c_0$:\n$$\nc_0 = \\mathbb{E}[T_m(\\xi) \\psi_0(\\xi)] = \\mathbb{E}[T_m(\\xi) \\cdot 1] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\frac{T_L + \\mu_0}{2} + \\frac{\\sigma_0}{2} \\xi \\right]\n$$\nBy linearity of expectation, and using the fact that $\\mathbb{E}[\\xi] = 0$:\n$$\nc_0 = \\frac{T_L + \\mu_0}{2} + \\frac{\\sigma_0}{2} \\mathbb{E}[\\xi] = \\frac{T_L + \\mu_0}{2}\n$$\nFor $c_1$:\n$$\nc_1 = \\mathbb{E}[T_m(\\xi) \\psi_1(\\xi)] = \\mathbb{E}[T_m(\\xi) \\cdot \\xi] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\left( \\frac{T_L + \\mu_0}{2} + \\frac{\\sigma_0}{2} \\xi \\right) \\xi \\right]\n$$\n$$\nc_1 = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\left(\\frac{T_L + \\mu_0}{2}\\right) \\xi + \\frac{\\sigma_0}{2} \\xi^2 \\right] = \\left(\\frac{T_L + \\mu_0}{2}\\right) \\mathbb{E}[\\xi] + \\frac{\\sigma_0}{2} \\mathbb{E}[\\xi^2]\n$$\nFor a standard normal variable $\\xi$, $\\mathbb{E}[\\xi] = 0$ and the variance $\\mathrm{Var}(\\xi) = \\mathbb{E}[\\xi^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[\\xi])^2 = 1$, which implies $\\mathbb{E}[\\xi^2] = 1$.\n$$\nc_1 = \\left(\\frac{T_L + \\mu_0}{2}\\right) (0) + \\frac{\\sigma_0}{2} (1) = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{2}\n$$\nFor $c_2$:\n$$\nc_2 = \\mathbb{E}[T_m(\\xi) \\psi_2(\\xi)] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ T_m(\\xi) \\cdot \\frac{\\xi^2-1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right] = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\left( \\frac{T_L + \\mu_0}{2} + \\frac{\\sigma_0}{2} \\xi \\right) (\\xi^2-1) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nc_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\left(\\frac{T_L + \\mu_0}{2}\\right)(\\xi^2-1) + \\frac{\\sigma_0}{2}(\\xi^3-\\xi) \\right]\n$$\nBy linearity of expectation:\n$$\nc_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{T_L + \\mu_0}{2}\\right)(\\mathbb{E}[\\xi^2]-\\mathbb{E}[1]) + \\frac{\\sigma_0}{2}(\\mathbb{E}[\\xi^3]-\\mathbb{E}[\\xi]) \\right]\n$$\nThe odd moments of a standard normal distribution are zero, so $\\mathbb{E}[\\xi]=0$ and $\\mathbb{E}[\\xi^3]=0$. We also have $\\mathbb{E}[\\xi^2]=1$.\n$$\nc_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{T_L + \\mu_0}{2}\\right)(1-1) + \\frac{\\sigma_0}{2}(0-0) \\right] = 0\n$$\nThe coefficient $c_2$ is zero because the model output $T_m(\\xi)$ is a linear polynomial in $\\xi$. The PCE is exact and terminates at the first order. The second-order expansion is technically correct, but the second-order coefficient is simply zero.\n\nPart 3: Mean and Variance from PCE Coefficients\nA key property of an orthonormal PCE is that the statistical moments of the output can be computed directly from the coefficients.\nThe mean of the quantity of interest is the first coefficient, $c_0$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[T_m] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} c_j \\psi_j(\\xi) \\right] = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} c_j \\mathbb{E}[\\psi_j(\\xi)]\n$$\nDue to orthonormality, $\\mathbb{E}[\\psi_j(\\xi)] = \\mathbb{E}[\\psi_j(\\xi)\\psi_0(\\xi)] = \\delta_{j0}$ (the Kronecker delta). Thus, only the $j=0$ term survives:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[T_m] = c_0 = \\frac{\\mu_0 + T_L}{2}\n$$\nThe variance is the sum of the squares of the higher-order coefficients (for $j \\ge 1$):\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(T_m) = \\mathbb{E}[(T_m - \\mathbb{E}[T_m])^2] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} c_j \\psi_j(\\xi)\\right)^2 \\right] = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} c_j c_k \\mathbb{E}[\\psi_j(\\xi)\\psi_k(\\xi)]\n$$\nUsing the orthonormality condition $\\mathbb{E}[\\psi_j(\\xi)\\psi_k(\\xi)] = \\delta_{jk}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(T_m) = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} c_j^2\n$$\nFor our second-order expansion, since all coefficients $c_j$ for $j \\ge 2$ are zero, this sum simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(T_m) = c_1^2 + c_2^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_0}{2}\\right)^2 + 0^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_0^2}{4}\n$$\n\nSummary of results:\n- $c_0 = \\frac{\\mu_0 + T_L}{2}$\n- $c_1 = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{2}$\n- $c_2 = 0$\n- $\\mathbb{E}[T_m] = c_0 = \\frac{\\mu_0 + T_L}{2}$\n- $\\mathrm{Var}(T_m) = c_1^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_0^2}{4}$\n\nThese will be arranged in the specified row matrix for the final answer.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\mu_0 + T_L}{2}  \\frac{\\sigma_0}{2}  0  \\frac{\\mu_0 + T_L}{2}  \\frac{\\sigma_0^2}{4} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2536803"}]}
