The full divergence of the heat flux in the steady state is zero, $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{q}=0$. For a constant conductivity tensor, this is $-\\nabla \\cdot (K \\nabla T) = 0$, which expands to:\n$$ k_{xx}\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} + 2k_{xy}\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x \\partial y} + k_{yy}\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} = 0 $$\nA conservative finite volume discretization approximates $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{q}$ at node $(i,j)$ as:\n$$ (\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{q})\\Big|_{i,j} \\approx \\frac{q_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j} - q_{i-\\frac{1}{2},j}}{\\Delta x} + \\frac{q_{i,j+\\frac{1}{2}} - q_{i,j-\\frac{1}{2}}}{\\Delta y} $$\nThe chosen flux approximations must ensure this discrete operator corresponds to the standard $9$-point central difference stencil for the continuous PDE operator. As demonstrated during the internal validation, the chosen approximation for the cross-derivative term does indeed recover the correct central difference form for $\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x \\partial y}$ when combined with its counterpart from the $y$-flux divergence.\n\nSubstituting the derived finite difference approximations into the expression for $q_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j}$:\n$$ q_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j} = -k_{xx} \\left(\\frac{T_{i+1,j} - T_{i,j}}{\\Delta x}\\right) - k_{xy} \\left(\\frac{T_{i+1,j+1} + T_{i,j+1} - T_{i+1,j-1} - T_{i,j-1}}{4\\Delta y}\\right) $$\nThis expression is a second-order accurate approximation for the east-face normal heat flux.

If $k_{xy} \\neq 0$, some corner coefficients are positive and others are negative.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n3) Explanation of non-monotonicity\n\nA finite difference scheme is called monotone if the resulting matrix $A$ is inverse-positive, i.e., all entries of its inverse $A^{-1}$ are non-negative. For an irreducible matrix $A$, a sufficient and often necessary condition for inverse-positivity is that $A$ is an $M$-matrix.\n\nA matrix $A$ is an $M$-matrix if it is a $Z$-matrix and its inverse is non-negative. A Z-matrix is a matrix whose off-diagonal entries are all non-positive ($A_{ij} \\le 0$ for $i \\neq j$).\n\nFrom the analysis in part (2), the off-diagonal entries of our stiffness matrix $A$ are:\n$$\nA_{(i,j),(i \\pm 1, j)} = -\\frac{k_{xx}}{h^2} \\le 0\n$$\n$$\nA_{(i,j),(i, j \\pm 1)} = -\\frac{k_{yy}}{h^2} \\le 0\n$$\n$$\nA_{(i,j),(i+1,j+1)} = A_{(i,j),(i-1,j-1)} = -\\frac{k_{xy}}{2h^2}\n$$\n$$\nA_{(i,j),(i-1,j+1)} = A_{(i,j),(i+1,j-1)} = +\\frac{k_{xy}}{2h^2}\n$$\nIf $k_{xy} \\neq 0$, then one half of the corner coefficients are positive and the other half are negative. For instance, if $k_{xy} > 0$, then $A_{(i,j),(i-1,j+1)}$ and $A_{(i,j),(i+1,j-1)}$ are strictly positive. This violates the condition for $A$ to be a $Z$-matrix. Consequently, $A$ cannot be an $M$-matrix. Since $A$ is not an $M$-matrix, the scheme is not monotone.\n\nThe lack of monotonicity is directly related to the violation of the discrete maximum principle (DMP). The weak DMP states that for an operator $L_h$, if $L_h u \\le 0$ everywhere in the interior of the domain, then the maximum value of $u$ must occur on the boundary. This principle holds if the scheme can be written in the form $u_{i,j} = \\sum_{(k,l)\\neq(i,j)} \\omega_{kl} u_{kl} + \\gamma$ where all weights $\\omega_{kl}$ are non-negative. From our scheme, we can express $u_{i,j}$ as:\n$$\nu_{i,j} = \\sum_{(k,l)\\neq(i,j)} \\left(-\\frac{A_{(i,j),(k,l)}}{A_{(i,j),(i,j)}}\\right) u_{k,l} + \\frac{h^2}{2(k_{xx}+k_{yy})} f_{i,j}\n$$\nThe weights are $\\omega_{(k,l)} = -A_{(i,j),(k,l)}/A_{(i,j),(i,j)}$. Since the diagonal entry $A_{(i,j),(i,j)}$ is positive, the non-negativity of weights requires $A_{(i,j),(k,l)} \\le 0$ for all off-diagonal entries. This is precisely the Z-matrix condition. Because this condition is violated when $k_{xy} \\neq 0$, some weights are negative. A negative weight allows a neighboring value to be \"subtracted,\" which can create a local maximum or minimum in the interior even if not warranted by the source term or boundary conditions. This manifests as spurious, grid-scale oscillations in the numerical solution, which do not represent the physics of the problem. While the scheme remains formally second-order accurate (i.e., the error magnitude decreases as $h^2$ in a suitable norm), these unphysical oscillations persist under grid refinement.\n\n4) Concrete counterexample\n\nWe are given $k_1=10$, $k_2=1$, and $\\phi=\\pi/4$.

Impose Dirichlet boundary conditions $u(0,t)=0$ and $u(L,t)=0$, and the initial condition $u(x,0)=\\sin\\!\\left(\\pi x/L\\right)$.\n\nDiscretization requirements (to be derived and implemented by you from the governing equation using the stated principles, not by quoting pre-packaged formulas): use a uniform spatial grid on $[0,L]$ with $N$ equal segments (so $N+1$ nodes, including boundaries) and a standard second-order central difference for the spatial second derivative. For time, use the Crank–Nicolson (CN) method to advance the solution. Assemble and solve the resulting tridiagonal linear system at each time step exactly (within floating-point arithmetic) using an algorithm appropriate for tridiagonal systems.\n\nError separation strategy: separate temporal from spatial error in two complementary ways.\n- Strategy A (analytic-in-time and space): exploit the exact solution\n$$\nu_{\\text{exact}}(x,t) = \\sin\\!\\left(\\pi x/L\\right)\\, \\exp\\!\\left(-\\alpha \\left(\\pi/L\\right)^2 t\\right),\n$$\nand ensure that spatial error is negligible by using a very fine spatial grid. With spatial error negligible, the observed error as $\\Delta t \\to 0$ reveals the temporal order.\n- Strategy B (same-grid temporal reference): at fixed spatial grid (so fixed $N$), estimate the temporal error by comparing a solution computed with time step $\\Delta t$ to a reference solution on the same spatial grid computed with a much smaller time step $\\Delta t_{\\text{ref}} = \\Delta t / 2^r$ for a given refinement factor $r$. Because both solutions share the same spatial discretization, subtracting them cancels the dominant spatial error, isolating temporal error.\n\nError measurement and observed order: for a sequence of time steps $\\{\\Delta t_j\\}$ with $\\Delta t_{j+1} = \\Delta t_j/2$, compute the discrete $L^2$-norm of the error at a fixed final time $T$ over the $N-1$ interior nodes $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^{N-1}$,\n$$\n\\|e(\\Delta t_j)\\|_{L^2_h} = \\left( h \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \\left( u_i^{\\text{num}}(T;\\Delta t_j) - u_i^{\\text{ref}}(T) \\right)^2 \\right)^{1/2},\n$$\nwhere $h = L/N$ and $u_i^{\\text{ref}}(T)$ is either $u_{\\text{exact}}(x_i,T)$ for Strategy A or the same-grid reference solution for Strategy B. Estimate the observed temporal order between consecutive pairs by\n$$\n\\hat{p}_j = \\frac{\\log\\!\\left(\\|e(\\Delta t_j)\\|_{L^2_h} / \\|e(\\Delta t_{j+1})\\|_{L^2_h}\\right)}{\\log\\!\\left(\\Delta t_j / \\Delta t_{j+1}\\right)}.\n$$\nReport a single order estimate $\\hat{p}$ per test case as the minimum of the pairwise $\\hat{p}_j$ to guard against non-asymptotic effects.\n\nScientific realism and units: use $L$ in $\\mathrm{m}$, $\\alpha$ in $\\mathrm{m^2/s}$, $t$ in $\\mathrm{s}$, and $u$ in $\\mathrm{K}$. All computed observed orders $\\hat{p}$ are dimensionless. When constructing time-step sequences for a given $T$, use steps that partition $T$ exactly; if necessary, internally adjust each $\\Delta t$ to $T/M$ with integer $M$.\n\nYour program must implement the above and run the following test suite, producing one scalar $\\hat{p}$ per case. Use the specified units. All cases share the same boundary conditions $u(0,t)=0\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and $u(L,t)=0\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and initial condition $u(x,0)=\\sin(\\pi x/L)\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nTest Suite:\n- Case A (happy path: analytic reference with negligible spatial error): $L=1\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\alpha=0.1\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}$, $T=0.1\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $N=4096$. Use Strategy A with the exact solution as reference. Use the time-step sequence $\\Delta t \\in \\{T/10,\\, T/20,\\, T/40,\\, T/80\\}$.\n- Case B (same-grid temporal reference to cancel spatial error): $L=1\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\alpha=0.1\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}$, $T=0.1\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $N=64$. Use Strategy B with refinement factor $r=6$ so that $\\Delta t_{\\text{ref}} = \\Delta t / 2^6$. Use the same time-step sequence $\\Delta t \\in \\{T/10,\\, T/20,\\, T/40,\\, T/80\\}$.\n- Case C (edge case demonstrating contamination when spatial error is not negligible if using analytic reference): $L=1\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\alpha=0.1\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}$, $T=0.1\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $N=16$. Use Strategy A with the exact solution as reference. Use the same time-step sequence $\\Delta t \\in \\{T/10,\\, T/20,\\, T/40,\\, T/80\\}$.\n\nNumerical outputs:\n- For each test case, compute the scalar $\\hat{p}$ as described. Round each $\\hat{p}$ to three decimal places.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the three results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the order [Case A, Case B, Case C], for example, \"[$text{pA}$,$\\text{pB}$,$\\text{pC}$]\". The printed line must contain plain decimal numerals without LaTeX markup. The observed orders are dimensionless and should be printed as floating-point numbers rounded to three decimal places.", "solution": "The problem posed is a well-defined exercise in the verification of a numerical method for a partial differential equation. It requires the implementation of the Crank-Nicolson scheme for the one-dimensional transient heat equation and a subsequent numerical experiment to confirm its second-order temporal accuracy. The problem statement is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and complete. All parameters and methodologies are specified with sufficient precision to permit a unique and verifiable solution. Thus, we proceed with the derivation and implementation.\n\nThe governing equation is the one-dimensional heat equation for a homogeneous medium with constant thermal diffusivity $\\alpha$ and no internal heat generation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThe domain is specified as $x \\in [0, L]$ and $t \\ge 0$. The analysis is performed on the interior of the spatial domain, $x \\in (0, L)$. The system is subject to homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, $u(0, t) = 0$ and $u(L, t) = 0$, and a sinusoidal initial condition, $u(x, 0) = \\sin(\\pi x/L)$.\n\nOur first task is to construct the finite difference approximation. We define a uniform spatial grid with $N+1$ nodes, $x_i = i h$ for $i = 0, 1, \\dots, N$, where the grid spacing is $h = L/N$. Time is discretized into steps of size $\\Delta t$, such that $t_n = n \\Delta t$. The temperature at a discrete point $(x_i, t_n)$ is denoted by $u_i^n \\approx u(x_i, t_n)$.\n\nThe second spatial derivative is approximated using a second-order central difference stencil:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\bigg|_{x_i} \\approx \\frac{u_{i-1} - 2u_i + u_{i+1}}{h^2} + O(h^2)\n$$\nThe Crank-Nicolson method is an implicit scheme that achieves second-order accuracy in time. It is formulated by centering the finite difference approximation at the half time step $t_{n+1/2} = t_n + \\Delta t/2$. The time derivative is approximated by a central difference about this point:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} \\bigg|_{t_{n+1/2}} \\approx \\frac{u_i^{n+1} - u_i^n}{\\Delta t} + O(\\Delta t^2)\n$$\nThe spatial derivative term is evaluated as the average of its values at time levels $n$ and $n+1$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\bigg|_{t_{n+1/2}} \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{u_{i-1}^n - 2u_i^n + u_{i+1}^n}{h^2} + \\frac{u_{i-1}^{n+1} - 2u_i^{n+1} + u_{i+1}^{n+1}}{h^2} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting these approximations into the governing PDE yields the discrete equation for each interior node $i = 1, \\dots, N-1$:\n$$\n\\frac{u_i^{n+1} - u_i^n}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2h^2} \\left[ (u_{i-1}^n - 2u_i^n + u_{i+1}^n) + (u_{i-1}^{n+1} - 2u_i^{n+1} + u_{i+1}^{n+1}) \\right]\n$$\nTo solve for the unknown temperatures at time level $n+1$, we rearrange the equation, placing terms at $t_{n+1}$ on the left-hand side and known terms at $t_n$ on the right-hand side. Let $\\lambda = \\alpha \\Delta t / h^2$ be the dimensionless mesh Fourier number. The equation becomes:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\lambda}{2} u_{i-1}^{n+1} + (1 + \\lambda) u_i^{n+1} - \\frac{\\lambda}{2} u_{i+1}^{n+1} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} u_{i-1}^n + (1 - \\lambda) u_i^n + \\frac{\\lambda}{2} u_{i+1}^n\n$$\nThis represents a system of $N-1$ linear equations for the unknown interior nodal temperatures $\\{u_i^{n+1}\\}_{i=1}^{N-1}$. The boundary conditions $u_0^{n+1} = 0$ and $u_N^{n+1} = 0$ are incorporated into the equations for the first ($i=1$) and last ($i=N-1$) interior nodes. The system can be written in matrix form as:\n$$\nA \\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = B \\mathbf{u}^{n}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{u}^n$ is the vector of interior temperatures $[u_1^n, u_2^n, \\dots, u_{N-1}^n]^T$. The matrices $A$ and $B$ are $(N-1) \\times (N-1)$ tridiagonal matrices with constant coefficients:\n$$\nA = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1+\\lambda & -\\frac{\\lambda}{2} & & \\\\\n-\\frac{\\lambda}{2} & 1+\\lambda & -\\frac{\\lambda}{2} & \\\\\n& \\ddots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\\\\n& & -\\frac{\\lambda}{2} & 1+\\lambda & -\\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\\\\n& & & -\\frac{\\lambda}{2} & 1+\\lambda\n\\end{pmatrix}\n, \\quad\nB = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1-\\lambda & \\frac{\\lambda}{2} & & \\\\\n\\frac{\\lambda}{2} & 1-\\lambda & \\frac{\\lambda}{2} & \\\\\n& \\ddots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\\\\n& & \\frac{\\lambda}{2} & 1-\\lambda & \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\\\\n& & & \\frac{\\lambda}{2} & 1-\\lambda\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe right-hand side vector, $\\mathbf{d}^n = B \\mathbf{u}^n$, is computed, and then the system $A \\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = \\mathbf{d}^n$ is solved for $\\mathbf{u}^{n+1}$. Since $A$ is tridiagonal, symmetric, and positive-definite, it is efficiently solved using the Thomas algorithm (a specialized Gaussian elimination), which has a computational cost of $O(N)$.\n\nTo verify the second-order temporal accuracy, we must measure the error and compute its convergence rate. The error is measured at a final time $T$ using a discrete $L^2$-norm:\n$$\n\\|e(\\Delta t_j)\\|_{L^2_h} = \\left( h \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \\left( u_i^{\\text{num}}(T;\\Delta t_j) - u_i^{\\text{ref}}(T) \\right)^2 \\right)^{1/2}\n$$\nHere, $u_i^{\\text{num}}$ is the numerical solution and $u_i^{\\text{ref}}$ is a reference solution.\nStrategy A uses the exact analytical solution as the reference: $u_{\\text{ref}}(x_i, T) = u_{\\text{exact}}(x_i, T) = \\sin(\\pi x_i/L) \\exp(-\\alpha (\\pi/L)^2 T)$. This strategy is effective only if the spatial discretization error is negligible compared to the temporal error.\nStrategy B constructs a reference solution on the same spatial grid but with a much smaller time step, $\\Delta t_{\\text{ref}} = \\Delta t / 2^r$. The error measured is $e = u^{\\text{num}}(\\Delta t) - u^{\\text{num}}(\\Delta t_{\\text{ref}})$. Since both solutions share the same spatial discretization, subtracting them cancels the dominant spatial error term, thereby isolating the temporal error.\n\nGiven a sequence of time steps $\\Delta t_j$ where $\\Delta t_{j+1} = \\Delta t_j/2$, we compute the corresponding errors $\\|e(\\Delta t_j)\\|_{L^2_h}$. The observed order of convergence between two successive refinements is:\n$$\n\\hat{p}_j = \\frac{\\log\\!\\left(\\|e(\\Delta t_j)\\|_{L^2_h} / \\|e(\\Delta t_{j+1})\\|_{L^2_h}\\right)}{\\log\\!\\left(\\Delta t_j / \\Delta t_{j+1}\\right)} = \\frac{\\log\\!\\left(\\|e(\\Delta t_j)\\|_{L^2_h} / \\|e(\\Delta t_{j+1})\\|_{L^2_h}\\right)}{\\log(2)}\n$$\nThe reported order $\\hat{p}$ is the minimum of these pairwise orders to provide a conservative estimate of the asymptotic behavior.\n\nThe three test cases are designed to illustrate these principles:\nCase A: With a very fine mesh ($N=4096$), the spatial error is minimized, and Strategy A should reveal the theoretical temporal order of $\\hat{p} \\approx 2.0$.\nCase B: With a coarser mesh ($N=64$), the spatial error is significant. However, Strategy B is used to cancel this spatial error, and again we expect to observe $\\hat{p} \\approx 2.0$.\nCase C: With a coarse mesh ($N=16$) and Strategy A, the non-negligible spatial error does not cancel and will eventually dominate the total error as $\\Delta t$ becomes small. This \"error floor\" prevents the total error from decreasing with $\\Delta t$, causing the observed order $\\hat{p}$ to drop significantly below $2.0$ and approach $0.0$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.linalg import solve_banded\n\n# from scipy import ...\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run the test suite and print results.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def run_cn_simulation(L, alpha, N, T, dt_nominal):\n        \"\"\"\n        Solves the 1D heat equation using the Crank-Nicolson method.\n\n        Args:\n            L (float): Length of the rod.\n            alpha (float): Thermal diffusivity.\n            N (int): Number of spatial segments.\n            T (float): Final time.\n            dt_nominal (float): Nominal time step size.\n\n        Returns:\n            numpy.ndarray: Temperature distribution at the interior nodes at time T.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Adjust dt to partition T exactly\n        num_steps = int(round(T / dt_nominal))\n        dt = T / num_steps\n\n        h = L / N\n        x = np.linspace(0, L, N + 1)\n        x_interior = x[1:-1]\n\n        # Initial condition on interior nodes\n        u = np.sin(np.pi * x_interior / L)\n\n        # Mesh Fourier number\n        lambda_val = alpha * dt / h**2\n\n        # Tridiagonal matrix A for the LHS\n        m = N - 1  # Size of the system\n        A_banded = np.zeros((3, m))\n        A_banded[0, 1:] = -lambda_val / 2.0\n        A_banded[1, :] = 1.0 + lambda_val\n        A_banded[2, :-1] = -lambda_val / 2.0\n\n        for _ in range(num_steps):\n            # Construct the RHS vector d = B * u\n            d = np.zeros(m)\n            # Inner points\n            d[1:-1] = (lambda_val / 2.0) * u[:-2] + \\\n                      (1.0 - lambda_val) * u[1:-1] + \\\n                      (lambda_val / 2.0) * u[2:]\n            \n            # Boundary-adjacent points (u_0 and u_N are 0)\n            if m > 0:\n                d[0] = (1.0 - lambda_val) * u[0] + (lambda_val / 2.0) * u[1] if m > 1 else (1.0 - lambda_val) * u[0]\n            if m > 1:\n                d[-1] = (lambda_val / 2.0) * u[-2] + (1.0 - lambda_val) * u[-1]\n\n            # Solve the tridiagonal system A * u_next = d\n            u = solve_banded((1, 1), A_banded, d, overwrite_ab=False, overwrite_b=False)\n\n        return u\n\n    def calculate_order(params, strategy, r=None):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the observed order of convergence for a given case.\n        \"\"\"\n        L, alpha, T, N, dt_sequence = params\n\n        h = L / N\n        x = np.linspace(0, L, N + 1)\n        x_interior = x[1:-1]\n        \n        errors = []\n        for dt in dt_sequence:\n            u_num = run_cn_simulation(L, alpha, N, T, dt)\n\n            if strategy == 'A':\n                # Strategy A: Reference is the exact solution\n                u_ref = np.sin(np.pi * x_interior / L) * np.exp(-alpha * (np.pi / L)**2 * T)\n            elif strategy == 'B':\n                # Strategy B: Reference is from a much smaller dt\n                dt_ref = dt / (2**r)\n                u_ref = run_cn_simulation(L, alpha, N, T, dt_ref)\n            else:\n                raise ValueError(\"Unknown strategy\")\n\n            # Calculate discrete L2 norm of the error\n            error_norm = np.sqrt(h * np.sum((u_num - u_ref)**2))\n            errors.append(error_norm)\n\n        # Calculate pairwise orders\n        orders = []\n        for i in range(len(errors) - 1):\n            # Ratio of time steps is 2\n            order = np.log(errors[i] / errors[i+1]) / np.log(2.0)\n            orders.append(order)\n\n        # Return the minimum of the pairwise orders, as per problem spec\n        return min(orders)\n\n    # Common parameters\n    L = 1.0  # m\n    alpha = 0.1  # m^2/s\n    T = 0.1  # s\n    dt_sequence = [T / 10.0, T / 20.0, T / 40.0, T / 80.0]\n\n    # Test Suite\n    # Case A: happy path (analytic reference, negligible spatial error)\n    params_A = (L, alpha, T, 4096, dt_sequence)\n    p_A = calculate_order(params_A, strategy='A')\n\n    # Case B: same-grid temporal reference\n    params_B = (L, alpha, T, 64, dt_sequence)\n    p_B = calculate_order(params_B, strategy='B', r=6)\n\n    # Case C: edge case (spatial error contamination)\n    params_C = (L, alpha, T, 16, dt_sequence)\n    p_C = calculate_order(params_C, strategy='A')\n\n    results = [round(p_A, 3), round(p_B, 3), round(p_C, 3)]\n    \n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2486032"}]}
