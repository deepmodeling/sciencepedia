The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. Therefore, it is deemed valid.\n\nThe analysis begins with the volume-averaged linear momentum balance for steady, single-phase, incompressible flow in a porous medium. For flow in one dimension, let us say the $x$-direction, this balance simplifies to an equation for the pressure gradient, $-\\frac{dp}{dx}$. In the limit of low Reynolds numbers (creeping flow), the inertial terms are negligible, and the pressure gradient is balanced solely by the viscous drag exerted by the solid matrix of the porous medium on the fluid. This leads to Darcy's Law, which establishes the required proportionality between the mean pressure gradient and the superficial velocity, $U_s$. The superficial velocity is defined as the volumetric flow rate, $\\dot{V}$, divided by the total cross-sectional area normal to the flow, $A$.\n\n$U_s = \\frac{\\dot{V}}{A}$\n\nDarcy's Law is expressed as:\n$$-\\frac{dp}{dx} = \\frac{\\mu_\\ell}{K} U_s$$\nwhere $\\mu_\\ell$ is the dynamic viscosity of the liquid and $K$ is the permeability of the porous wick. The negative sign indicates that the pressure decreases in the direction of flow. The magnitude of the pressure gradient is therefore $|\\frac{dp}{dx}| = \\frac{\\mu_\\ell}{K} U_s$.\n\nTo find the total pressure drop, $\\Delta p_\\ell$, across the wick of thickness (length) $L_w$, we integrate the pressure gradient over this length. Assuming the properties $K$, $\\mu_\\ell$, and the flow rate $\\dot{V}$ (and thus $U_s$) are constant along the flow path, the pressure gradient is constant.\n$$\\Delta p_\\ell = \\int_{0}^{L_w} \\left(-\\frac{dp}{dx}\\right) dx = \\left(\\frac{\\mu_\\ell}{K} U_s\\right) L_w$$\nSubstituting the expression for the superficial velocity, $U_s = \\frac{\\dot{V}}{A}$, we obtain the expression for the total liquid pressure drop:\n$$\\Delta p_\\ell = \\frac{\\mu_\\ell L_w \\dot{V}}{K A}$$\nUsing the provided data: $L_w = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $A = 1.50 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m^2}$, $K = 3.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{m^2}$, $\\mu_\\ell = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}$, and $\\dot{V} = 1.20 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m^3 \\, s^{-1}}$.\n$$\\Delta p_\\ell = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}) (2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}) (1.20 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m^3 \\, s^{-1}})}{(3.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{m^2}) (1.50 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m^2})}$$\n$$\\Delta p_\\ell = \\frac{2.4 \\times 10^{-13}}{4.5 \\times 10^{-15}}\\ \\mathrm{Pa} = 53.333... \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$$\nRounded to four significant figures, the viscous pressure drop is $\\Delta p_\\ell = 53.33\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$.\n\nNext, we augment the momentum balance to include the inertial drag effects, which become significant at higher flow velocities. This is accomplished using the Forchheimer correction, resulting in the Darcy-Forchheimer equation for the pressure gradient magnitude:\n$$\\left|-\\frac{dp}{dx}\\right| = \\underbrace{\\frac{\\mu_\\ell}{K} U_s}_{\\text{Viscous Drag}} + \\underbrace{\\rho_\\ell \\beta U_s^2}_{\\text{Inertial Drag}}$$\nHere, $\\rho_\\ell$ is the liquid density and $\\beta$ is the inertial or Forchheimer coefficient.\n\nThe problem asks for the critical superficial velocity, $U_{s,\\mathrm{crit}}$, at which the inertial effects become comparable to the viscous resistance. This condition is defined by equating the magnitudes of the viscous and inertial terms in the pressure gradient equation:\n$$\\frac{\\mu_\\ell}{K} U_{s,\\mathrm{crit}} = \\rho_\\ell \\beta U_{s,\\mathrm{crit}}^2$$\nFor a non-trivial flow ($U_{s,\\mathrm{crit}} \\neq 0$), we can divide both sides by $U_{s,\\mathrm{crit}}$ to solve for the critical velocity:\n$$U_{s,\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{\\mu_\\ell}{\\rho_\\ell \\beta K}$$\nThe corresponding critical volumetric flow rate, $\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, is found using the relation $\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{crit}} = U_{s,\\mathrm{crit}} A$:\n$$\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{\\mu_\\ell A}{\\rho_\\ell \\beta K}$$\nWe now evaluate this expression using the given data: $\\rho_\\ell = 1.000 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{kg \\, m^{-3}}$ and $\\beta = 1.20 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-1}}$.\n$$\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}) (1.50 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m^2})}{(1.000 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{kg \\, m^{-3}}) (1.20 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-1}}) (3.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{m^2})}$$\n$$\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{1.50 \\times 10^{-6}}{3.6 \\times 10^{-2}}\\ \\mathrm{m^3 \\, s^{-1}} = 0.041666... \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m^3 \\, s^{-1}} = 4.1666... \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^3 \\, s^{-1}}$$\nRounded to four significant figures, the critical volumetric flow rate is $\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 4.167 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^3 \\, s^{-1}}$.\n\nThe regime in which Forchheimer corrections become necessary is when the inertial drag term is no longer negligible compared to the viscous drag term. Our derivation of $U_{s,\\mathrm{crit}}$ identifies the superficial velocity at which these two terms are of equal magnitude. Therefore, the Forchheimer correction is required when the actual superficial velocity $U_s$ approaches or exceeds the critical superficial velocity $U_{s,\\mathrm{crit}}$. Equivalently, this can be stated in terms of the Forchheimer number, $Fo = \\frac{\\rho_\\ell \\beta K U_s}{\\mu_\\ell}$, which represents the ratio of inertial to viscous forces. The correction becomes important as $Fo$ approaches and exceeds unity, since $Fo = U_s / U_{s,\\mathrm{crit}}$.

The maximum capillary pressure head available to drive the liquid flow is given by the Laplace-Young equation. For a meniscus in a pore of effective radius $r_{\\text{eff}}$, this pressure is $\\Delta P_{\\text{cap, max}} = \\frac{2 \\sigma \\cos(\\theta)}{r_{\\text{eff}}}$, where $\\sigma$ is the surface tension and $\\theta$ is the contact angle. The factor of $2$ is standard for a simple cylindrical capillary, but any constant of proportionality would suffice as it will be absorbed into a collective constant.\n\n2.  The pressure drop required to drive the liquid flow through the porous wick is given by Darcy's law. For a one-dimensional flow over an effective length $L_{e}$ through a wick of cross-sectional area $A_{w}$, the liquid pressure drop $\\Delta P_{l}$ is related to the mass flow rate $\\dot{m}_{l}$ by:\n    $$ \\Delta P_{l} = \\left( \\frac{\\mu_{l} L_{e}}{\\rho_{l} A_{w}} \\right) \\frac{\\dot{m}_{l}}{K} $$\n    where $\\mu_l$ and $\\rho_l$ are the liquid dynamic viscosity and density, respectively, and $K$ is the intrinsic permeability of the wick.\n\n3.  At the capillary limit, the maximum sustainable heat load $Q_{\\max}$ corresponds to the maximum mass flow rate $\\dot{m}_{l, \\max}$. This occurs when the entire capillary pressure head is consumed by the viscous pressure drop in the liquid: $\\Delta P_{\\text{cap, max}} = \\Delta P_{l}$.\n    $$ \\frac{2 \\sigma \\cos(\\theta)}{r_{\\text{eff}}} = \\left( \\frac{\\mu_{l} L_{e}}{\\rho_{l} A_{w}} \\right) \\frac{\\dot{m}_{l, \\max}}{K} $$\n\n4.

The maximum heat transport rate is related to the maximum mass flow rate by the latent heat of vaporization, $h_{fg}$: $Q_{\\max} = \\dot{m}_{l, \\max} h_{fg}$.\n    $$ Q_{\\max} = \\left( \\frac{2 \\sigma \\rho_{l} A_{w} h_{fg}}{\\mu_{l} L_{e}} \\right) \\frac{K \\cos(\\theta)}{r_{\\text{eff}}} $$\n    Since all terms in the parenthesis are considered constant, we can define a single constant $C = \\frac{2 \\sigma \\rho_{l} A_{w} h_{fg}}{\\mu_{l} L_{e}}$. The relation simplifies to:\n    $$ Q_{\\max}(K, r_{\\text{eff}}, \\theta) = C \\frac{K \\cos(\\theta)}{r_{\\text{eff}}} $$\n\nTo perform the sensitivity analysis, we take the natural logarithm of this expression:\n$$ \\ln Q_{\\max} = \\ln C + \\ln K - \\ln r_{\\text{eff}} + \\ln(\\cos(\\theta)) $$\n\nNow, we compute the required partial derivatives evaluated at the nominal point $(K_{0}, r_{\\text{eff},0}, \\theta_{0})$.\n\nFor $K$: The sensitivity is expressed as a logarithmic derivative.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\ln Q_{\\max}}{\\partial \\ln K} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ln K} (\\ln C + \\ln K - \\ln r_{\\text{eff}} + \\ln(\\cos(\\theta))) = 1 $$\nThis sensitivity is a constant, independent of the operating point.\n\nFor $r_{\\text{eff}}$: The sensitivity is also a logarithmic derivative.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\ln Q_{\\max}}{\\partial \\ln r_{\\text{eff}}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ln r_{\\text{eff}}} (\\ln C + \\ln K - \\ln r_{\\text{eff}} + \\ln(\\cos(\\theta))) = -1 $$\nThis sensitivity is also a constant.\n\nFor $\\theta$: The sensitivity is a standard partial derivative.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\ln Q_{\\max}}{\\partial \\theta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} (\\ln C + \\ln K - \\ln r_{\\text{eff}} + \\ln(\\cos(\\theta))) = \\frac{1}{\\cos(\\theta)} (-\\sin(\\theta)) = -\\tan(\\theta) $$\nThis sensitivity depends on the value of $\\theta$.\n\nWe can now calculate the magnitude-weighted contributions $c_{K}$, $c_{r}$, and $c_{\\theta}$.\n\nContribution from $K$:\n$$ c_{K} = \\left|\\frac{\\partial \\ln Q_{\\max}}{\\partial \\ln K}\\right| \\left|\\frac{\\Delta K}{K_{0}}\\right| = |1| \\cdot (0.30) = 0.30 $$\n\nContribution from $r_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$ c_{r} = \\left|\\frac{\\partial \\ln Q_{\\max}}{\\partial \\ln r_{\\text{eff}}}\\right| \\left|\\frac{\\Delta r_{\\text{eff}}}{r_{\\text{eff},0}}\\right| = |-1| \\cdot (0.12) = 0.12 $$\n\nContribution from $\\theta$:\nThis must be evaluated at the nominal angle $\\theta_{0} = 18^{\\circ}$.

The provided physical model is self-contained and scientifically sound. I will proceed with a systematic, principle-based solution.\n\nThe core of the analysis rests upon the provided model for the steady-state end-to-end temperature difference, $\\Delta T$, as a function of the heat load, $Q$:\n$$\n\\Delta T(Q) = R_{\\mathrm{struct}}\\, Q + S\\, \\Delta p_{\\mathrm{tot}}(Q)\n$$\nThe total pressure drop, $\\Delta p_{\\mathrm{tot}}(Q)$, is the sum of contributions from the liquid flow in the wick ($\\Delta p_{\\ell}$), the vapor flow in the core ($\\Delta p_{v}$), and the gravitational head ($\\Delta p_{g}$):\n$$\n\\Delta p_{\\mathrm{tot}}(Q) = \\Delta p_{\\ell}(Q) + \\Delta p_{v}(Q) + \\Delta p_{g}\n$$\nWe must first express each pressure drop component as a function of the heat load, $Q$. The mass flow rate, $\\dot{m}$, is directly proportional to $Q$ via the latent heat of vaporization, $h_{fg}$:\n$$\n\\dot{m} = \\frac{Q}{h_{fg}}\n$$\nThe individual pressure drop terms are:\n1.  **Gravity Head, $\\Delta p_{g}$**: This term is independent of heat load.\n    $$\n    \\Delta p_{g} = \\rho_{\\ell} g \\Delta z\n    $$\n    where $\\rho_{\\ell}$ is the liquid density, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $\\Delta z$ is the elevation change.\n\n2.  **Vapor Pressure Drop, $\\Delta p_{v}$**: This term is modeled as linear in the mass flow rate, and thus linear in $Q$.\n    $$\n    \\Delta p_{v}(Q) = R_{v} \\dot{m} = \\left(\\frac{R_{v}}{h_{fg}}\\right) Q\n    $$\n\n3.  **Liquid Pressure Drop, $\\Delta p_{\\ell}$**: This term is derived from Darcy's law. The volumetric flow rate of the liquid, $Q_{\\ell}$, is $\\dot{m}/\\rho_{\\ell}$.\n    $$\n    \\Delta p_{\\ell}(Q) = \\mu_{\\ell} \\frac{L_{\\ell}}{K A_{w}} Q_{\\ell} = \\mu_{\\ell} \\frac{L_{\\ell}}{K A_{w}} \\frac{\\dot{m}}{\\rho_{\\ell}} = \\left(\\frac{\\mu_{\\ell} L_{\\ell}}{K A_{w} \\rho_{\\ell} h_{fg}}\\right) Q\n    $$\n    Here, $\\mu_{\\ell}$ is the liquid viscosity, $L_{\\ell}$ is the liquid flow path length, $A_{w}$ is the wick cross-sectional area, and $K$ is the permeability we seek.\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the equation for $\\Delta T(Q)$ reveals a linear relationship between $\\Delta T$ and $Q$:\n$$\n\\Delta T(Q) = R_{\\mathrm{struct}}\\, Q + S \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\mu_{\\ell} L_{\\ell}}{K A_{w} \\rho_{\\ell} h_{fg}}\\right) Q + \\left(\\frac{R_{v}}{h_{fg}}\\right) Q + \\rho_{\\ell} g \\Delta z \\right]\n$$\nRearranging into the standard linear form $y = mx + c$, with $y = \\Delta T$ and $x = Q$, gives:\n$$\n\\Delta T(Q) = \\left[ R_{\\mathrm{struct}} + \\frac{S R_{v}}{h_{fg}} + \\left(\\frac{S \\mu_{\\ell} L_{\\ell}}{A_{w} \\rho_{\\ell} h_{fg}}\\right) \\frac{1}{K} \\right] Q + \\left(S \\rho_{\\ell} g \\Delta z\\right)\n$$\nThis equation has the form $\\Delta T = mQ + c$, where the slope $m$ and intercept $c$ are:\n$$\nm = R_{\\mathrm{struct}} + \\frac{S R_{v}}{h_{fg}} + \\left(\\frac{S \\mu_{\\ell} L_{\\ell}}{A_{w} \\rho_{\\ell} h_{fg}}\\right) \\frac{1}{K}\n$$\n$$\nc = S \\rho_{\\ell} g \\Delta z\n$$\n\n**Step 1: Estimation of Wick Permeability, $K$**\nFor each test case, we are given a set of experimental data points $(Q_i, \\Delta T_i)$. We perform a linear least-squares regression on this data to determine the empirical slope, $m$. Once $m$ is known, we can algebraically rearrange the slope equation to solve for the permeability, $K$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{K} = \\left( m - R_{\\mathrm{struct}} - \\frac{S R_{v}}{h_{fg}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{A_{w} \\rho_{\\ell} h_{fg}}{S \\mu_{\\ell} L_{\\ell}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nK = \\left[ \\left( m - R_{\\mathrm{struct}} - \\frac{S R_{v}}{h_{fg}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{A_{w} \\rho_{\\ell} h_{fg}}{S \\mu_{\\ell} L_{\\ell}} \\right) \\right]^{-1}\n$$\nThis procedure allows for the determination of $K$ using the measured linear trend of $\\Delta T$ versus $Q$ and the known thermophysical and geometric parameters.\n\n**Step 2: Estimation of Effective Pore Radius, $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$**\nThe second parameter, $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is found by applying the capillary limit condition. The problem states that the maximum heat load in each dataset, $Q_{\\max}$, corresponds to the point of incipient capillary limit. At this limit, the total pressure drop required to circulate the fluid is exactly equal to the maximum capillary pressure the wick can generate.\n$$\n\\Delta p_{\\mathrm{tot}}(Q_{\\max}) = \\Delta p_{\\mathrm{cap}}\n$$\nThe capillary pressure is given by the Young-Laplace equation:\n$$\n\\Delta p_{\\mathrm{cap}} = \\frac{2 \\sigma \\cos\\theta}{r_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the surface tension and $\\theta$ is the contact angle. The contact angle $\\theta = 10^\\circ$ must be converted to radians for the cosine function.\n\nTo find $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, we first calculate $\\Delta p_{\\mathrm{tot}}(Q_{\\max})$ using the component-wise model with the value of $K$ determined in Step $1$:\n$$\n\\Delta p_{\\mathrm{tot}}(Q_{\\max}) = \\rho_{\\ell} g \\Delta z + \\left(\\frac{R_{v}}{h_{fg}}\\right)Q_{\\max} + \\left(\\frac{\\mu_{\\ell} L_{\\ell}}{K A_{w} \\rho_{\\ell} h_{fg}}\\right)Q_{\\max}\n$$\nFinally, we solve for $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{2 \\sigma \\cos\\theta}{\\Delta p_{\\mathrm{tot}}(Q_{\\max})}\n$$\nThis completes the inverse estimation procedure. The following constants are used in all calculations: $\\mu_{\\ell} = 2.82 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\,s}$, $\\rho_{\\ell} = 958.4\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^3}$, $\\sigma = 5.89 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{N/m}$, $h_{fg} = 2.257 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{J/kg}$, $g = 9.81\\ \\mathrm{m/s^2}$, $S = 2.766 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K/Pa}$, and $\\theta = 10^\\circ$.
