The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the specific flow exergy, $\\psi$. We consider a steady-flow control volume (CV) with a single inlet (state $1$) and a single outlet, where the fluid has reached the dead state (state $0$). The fluid stream has a mass flow rate of $\\dot{m}$. The dead state is defined by the environment's temperature $T_0$ and pressure $p_0$, with specific enthalpy $h_0$ and specific entropy $s_0$. The problem states that changes in kinetic and potential energies are negligible.\n\nThe First Law of Thermodynamics (energy balance) for this steady-flow control volume is:\n$$\n\\dot{E}_{in} = \\dot{E}_{out}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{m}h_1 + \\dot{Q} = \\dot{m}h_0 + \\dot{W}\n$$\nHere, $\\dot{Q}$ is the rate of heat transfer *to* the control volume, and $\\dot{W}$ is the rate of work done *by* the control volume. We are interested in the maximum possible work, $\\dot{W}_{max}$, which corresponds to the exergy flow. Rearranging for the work output rate gives:\n$$\n\\dot{W} = \\dot{m}(h_1 - h_0) + \\dot{Q}\n$$\nTo denote a general state, we replace subscript $1$ with a generic state with properties $(h, s)$. The outlet is at the dead state $(h_0, s_0)$.\n$$\n\\dot{W} = \\dot{m}(h - h_0) + \\dot{Q}\n$$\n\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics is applied to a composite system consisting of the control volume and the immediate surroundings (the environment at temperature $T_0$ which exchanges heat with the CV). The total entropy generation rate, $\\dot{S}_{gen,tot}$, for this combined system must be non-negative:\n$$\n\\dot{S}_{gen,tot} = \\Delta \\dot{S}_{CV} + \\Delta \\dot{S}_{env} \\geq 0\n$$\nFor a steady-flow process, the rate of entropy change *of the fluid passing through* the control volume is $\\Delta \\dot{S}_{CV} = \\dot{m}(s_0 - s)$. The rate of heat transfer from the control volume to the environment is $-\\dot{Q}$. The environment is a large thermal reservoir at a constant temperature $T_0$, so its entropy change rate is $\\Delta \\dot{S}_{env} = -\\frac{\\dot{Q}}{T_0}$. Substituting these into the entropy generation equation:\n$$\n\\dot{S}_{gen,tot} = \\dot{m}(s_0 - s) - \\frac{\\dot{Q}}{T_0} \\geq 0\n$$\nThis inequality places a constraint on the heat transfer $\\dot{Q}$:\n$$\n\\dot{Q} \\leq T_0 \\dot{m}(s_0 - s)\n$$\nTo maximize the work output $\\dot{W}$, we must maximize the algebraic value of $\\dot{Q}$ in the energy balance equation. The maximum value for $\\dot{Q}$ is achieved when the process is reversible, making $\\dot{S}_{gen,tot} = 0$.\n$$\n\\dot{Q}_{rev} = T_0 \\dot{m}(s_0 - s)\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for the maximum (reversible) heat transfer into the work equation gives the maximum possible work rate, $\\dot{W}_{max}$:\n$$\n\\dot{W}_{max} = \\dot{m}(h - h_0) + \\dot{Q}_{rev} = \\dot{m}(h - h_0) + T_0 \\dot{m}(s_0 - s)\n$$\nFactoring out $\\dot{m}$:\n$$\n\\dot{W}_{max} = \\dot{m} \\left[ (h - h_0) + T_0(s_0 - s) \\right] = \\dot{m} \\left[ (h - h_0) - T_0(s - s_0) \\right]\n$$\nThe specific flow exergy, $\\psi$, is defined as the maximum useful work per unit mass, $\\psi = \\frac{\\dot{W}_{max}}{\\dot{m}}$. With negligible kinetic and potential energy contributions, the expression is:\n$$\n\\psi = (h - h_0) - T_0(s - s_0)\n$$\nThis is the required expression for the specific flow exergy.\n\nNext, we evaluate the specific flow exergy for Stream L (saturated liquid) and Stream V (superheated steam) using the provided data.\nThe dead state properties are $h_0 = 104.86\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}$, $s_0 = 0.3672\\,\\mathrm{kJ/(kg\\cdot K)}$, and $T_0 = 298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nFor Stream L (saturated liquid at $p = 100\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$):\nThe properties are $h_L = 419.04\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}$ and $s_L = 1.3070\\,\\mathrm{kJ/(kg\\cdot K)}$.\nThe specific flow exergy $\\psi_L$ is:\n$$\n\\psi_L = (h_L - h_0) - T_0(s_L - s_0)\n$$\n$$\n\\psi_L = (419.04 - 104.86)\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{kJ}}{\\mathrm{kg}} - (298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\times (1.3070 - 0.3672)\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{kJ}}{\\mathrm{kg}\\cdot\\mathrm{K}}\n$$\n$$\n\\psi_L = 314.18\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{kJ}}{\\mathrm{kg}} - (298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\times (0.9398\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{kJ}}{\\mathrm{kg}\\cdot\\mathrm{K}})\n$$\n$$\n\\psi_L = 314.18\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{kJ}}{\\mathrm{kg}} - 280.19827\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{kJ}}{\\mathrm{kg}}\n$$\n$$\n\\psi_L = 33.98173\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{kJ}}{\\mathrm{kg}}\n$$\n\nFor Stream V (superheated steam at $p = 100\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$, $T = 773.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$):\nThe properties are $h_V = 3508.00\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}$ and $s_V = 8.9010\\,\\mathrm{kJ/(kg\\cdot K)}$.\nThe specific flow exergy $\\psi_V$ is:\n$$\n\\psi_V = (h_V - h_0) - T_0(s_V - s_0)\n$$\n$$\n\\psi_V = (3508.00 - 104.86)\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{kJ}}{\\mathrm{kg}} - (298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\times (8.9010 - 0.3672)\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{kJ}}{\\mathrm{kg}\\cdot\\mathrm{K}}\n$$\n$$\n\\psi_V = 3403.14\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{kJ}}{\\mathrm{kg}} - (298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\times (8.5338\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{kJ}}{\\mathrm{kg}\\cdot\\mathrm{K}})\n$$\n$$\n\\psi_V = 3403.14\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{kJ}}{\\mathrm{kg}} - 2544.47157\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{kJ}}{\\mathrm{kg}}\n$$\n$$\n\\psi_V = 858.66843\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{kJ}}{\\mathrm{kg}}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $r = \\frac{\\psi_V}{\\psi_L}$:\n$$\nr = \\frac{858.66843}{33.98173} \\approx 25.2686\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the ratio is $25.27$.\n\nThe influence of the phase of water on exergy is substantial. The quantity of exergy, $\\psi = (h - h_0) - T_0(s - s_0)$, represents the quality of energy. It is the difference between the enthalpy change relative to the dead state, $(h-h_0)$, and the unavoidable energy loss, $T_0(s-s_0)$, which must be rejected as heat to the environment at $T_0$ due to the Second Law.\nFor the saturated liquid (Stream L), the enthalpy and entropy are moderately higher than the dead state. The enthalpy difference is $(h_L - h_0) = 314.18\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}$ and the unavailable energy is $T_0(s_L - s_0) = 280.20\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}$. These two terms are of comparable magnitude, resulting in a relatively small exergy of $\\psi_L \\approx 34.0\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}$.\nFor the superheated steam (Stream V), the phase change and subsequent heating to a high temperature lead to a dramatic increase in both enthalpy and entropy. The enthalpy difference is $(h_V - h_0) = 3403.14\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}$, more than $10$ times that of the liquid. The unavailable energy term, $T_0(s_V - s_0) = 2544.47\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}$, also increases significantly. However, the increase in total energy content (enthalpy) far surpasses the increase in the unavailable portion (entropy term). The resulting exergy, $\\psi_V \\approx 858.7\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}$, is over $25$ times larger than that of the liquid state. This demonstrates that high-temperature steam possesses a much higher quality of energy and a greater potential to perform useful work than hot liquid water at the same pressure, which is the fundamental thermodynamic reason for using vapor power cycles in engineering.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{25.27}\n$$", "id": "2482340"}, {"introduction": "Entropy Generation Minimization (EGM) offers more than just analysis; it provides a powerful philosophy for optimal design.

We must first express this total rate as a function of the porosity, $\\varepsilon$.\n\n$T_0 \\dot{S}_{gen}(\\varepsilon) = \\dot{W}_{pump}(\\varepsilon) + T_0 \\dot{S}_{gen,ht}(\\varepsilon)$\n\nFirst, we formulate the pumping power term, $\\dot{W}_{pump}(\\varepsilon)$.\n$\\dot{W}_{pump} = \\dot{V} \\Delta p = \\dot{V} \\frac{\\mu L U}{K} = \\dot{V} \\frac{\\mu L (\\dot{V}/A_c)}{K} = \\frac{\\mu L \\dot{V}^2}{A_c K}$\nUsing the Kozeny-Carman relation for permeability, $K(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{d_p^2 \\varepsilon^3}{C_k (1-\\varepsilon)^2}$, we substitute it into the expression for $\\dot{W}_{pump}$:\n$\\dot{W}_{pump}(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{\\mu L \\dot{V}^2}{A_c} \\left( \\frac{C_k (1-\\varepsilon)^2}{d_p^2 \\varepsilon^3} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{\\mu L \\dot{V}^2 C_k}{A_c d_p^2} \\right) \\frac{(1-\\varepsilon)^2}{\\varepsilon^3}$\n\nNext, we formulate the heat transfer exergy destruction term, $T_0 \\dot{S}_{gen,ht}(\\varepsilon)$.\nUsing the specified approximation for a small temperature rise, $1 - T_0/T_s \\approx (T_s - T_0)/T_0$, the exergy destruction is:\n$T_0 \\dot{S}_{gen,ht} = \\dot{Q} \\left( \\frac{T_s-T_0}{T_0} \\right)$\nThe temperature difference $(T_s - T_0)$ is obtained from the heat transfer rate equation, $\\dot{Q} = h A_s (T_s - T_0)$, which gives $T_s-T_0 = \\frac{\\dot{Q}}{h A_s}$.\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$T_0 \\dot{S}_{gen,ht} = \\frac{\\dot{Q}^2}{T_0 h A_s}$\nNow, we must express the product $h A_s$ as a function of $\\varepsilon$.\nThe total heat transfer area is $A_s = a_s V = a_s (A_c L)$. Using $a_s(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{6(1-\\varepsilon)}{d_p}$, we have:\n$A_s(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{6 A_c L (1-\\varepsilon)}{d_p}$\nThe hydraulic diameter is $d_h = \\frac{4\\varepsilon}{a_s} = \\frac{4\\varepsilon d_p}{6(1-\\varepsilon)} = \\frac{2\\varepsilon d_p}{3(1-\\varepsilon)}$.\nThe heat transfer coefficient is $h = \\frac{\\mathrm{Nu} \\, k_f}{d_h} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Nu} \\, k_f}{\\frac{2\\varepsilon d_p}{3(1-\\varepsilon)}} = \\frac{3 \\mathrm{Nu} \\, k_f (1-\\varepsilon)}{2\\varepsilon d_p}$.\nThe product $h A_s$ is therefore:\n$h A_s(\\varepsilon) = \\left( \\frac{3 \\mathrm{Nu} \\, k_f (1-\\varepsilon)}{2\\varepsilon d_p} \\right) \\left( \\frac{6 A_c L (1-\\varepsilon)}{d_p} \\right) = \\frac{9 \\mathrm{Nu} \\, k_f A_c L (1-\\varepsilon)^2}{d_p^2 \\varepsilon}$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $T_0 \\dot{S}_{gen,ht}$:\n$T_0 \\dot{S}_{gen,ht}(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{\\dot{Q}^2}{T_0} \\left( \\frac{d_p^2 \\varepsilon}{9 \\mathrm{Nu} \\, k_f A_c L (1-\\varepsilon)^2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{\\dot{Q}^2 d_p^2}{9 T_0 \\mathrm{Nu} \\, k_f A_c L} \\right) \\frac{\\varepsilon}{(1-\\varepsilon)^2}$\n\nThe total exergy destruction rate is the sum of the two terms:\n$T_0 \\dot{S}_{gen}(\\varepsilon) = \\left( \\frac{\\mu L \\dot{V}^2 C_k}{A_c d_p^2} \\right) \\frac{(1-\\varepsilon)^2}{\\varepsilon^3} + \\left( \\frac{\\dot{Q}^2 d_p^2}{9 T_0 \\mathrm{Nu} \\, k_f A_c L} \\right) \\frac{\\varepsilon}{(1-\\varepsilon)^2}$\nLet us define two constants, $C_1$ and $C_2$, to represent the collections of fixed parameters:\n$C_1 = \\frac{\\mu L \\dot{V}^2 C_k}{A_c d_p^2}$\n$C_2 = \\frac{\\dot{Q}^2 d_p^2}{9 T_0 \\mathrm{Nu} \\, k_f A_c L}$\nThe expression to minimize is:\n$T_0 \\dot{S}_{gen}(\\varepsilon) = C_1 \\frac{(1-\\varepsilon)^2}{\\varepsilon^3} + C_2 \\frac{\\varepsilon}{(1-\\varepsilon)^2}$\n\nTo find the optimal porosity $\\varepsilon^\\star$ that minimizes this function, we differentiate with respect to $\\varepsilon$ and set the result to zero:\n$\\frac{d}{d\\varepsilon} \\left( T_0 \\dot{S}_{gen}(\\varepsilon) \\right) = 0$\n$\\frac{d}{d\\varepsilon} \\left( C_1 \\frac{(1-\\varepsilon)^2}{\\varepsilon^3} \\right) = C_1 \\frac{-2(1-\\varepsilon)\\varepsilon^3 - (1-\\varepsilon)^2(3\\varepsilon^2)}{\\varepsilon^6} = C_1 \\frac{(1-\\varepsilon)(-2\\varepsilon - 3(1-\\varepsilon))}{\\varepsilon^4} = C_1 \\frac{(1-\\varepsilon)(\\varepsilon-3)}{\\varepsilon^4}$\n$\\frac{d}{d\\varepsilon} \\left( C_2 \\frac{\\varepsilon}{(1-\\varepsilon)^2} \\right) = C_2 \\frac{1 \\cdot (1-\\varepsilon)^2 - \\varepsilon \\cdot 2(1-\\varepsilon)(-1)}{(1-\\varepsilon)^4} = C_2 \\frac{(1-\\varepsilon)+2\\varepsilon}{(1-\\varepsilon)^3} = C_2 \\frac{1+\\varepsilon}{(1-\\varepsilon)^3}$\nSetting the sum to zero:\n$C_1 \\frac{(1-\\varepsilon)(\\varepsilon-3)}{\\varepsilon^4} + C_2 \\frac{1+\\varepsilon}{(1-\\varepsilon)^3} = 0$\n$C_2 \\frac{1+\\varepsilon}{(1-\\varepsilon)^3} = -C_1 \\frac{(1-\\varepsilon)(\\varepsilon-3)}{\\varepsilon^4} = C_1 \\frac{(1-\\varepsilon)(3-\\varepsilon)}{\\varepsilon^4}$\nRearranging to solve for the ratio $C_2/C_1$:\n$\\frac{C_2}{C_1} = \\frac{(1-\\varepsilon)(3-\\varepsilon)}{\\varepsilon^4} \\frac{(1-\\varepsilon)^3}{1+\\varepsilon} = \\frac{(1-\\varepsilon)^4 (3-\\varepsilon)}{\\varepsilon^4 (1+\\varepsilon)} = \\left(\\frac{1-\\varepsilon}{\\varepsilon}\\right)^4 \\frac{3-\\varepsilon}{1+\\varepsilon}$\n\nThis ratio $C_2/C_1$ is a dimensionless group, let us call it $\\Pi$.\n$\\Pi = \\frac{C_2}{C_1} = \\frac{\\frac{\\dot{Q}^2 d_p^2}{9 T_0 \\mathrm{Nu} \\, k_f A_c L}}{\\frac{\\mu L \\dot{V}^2 C_k}{A_c d_p^2}} = \\frac{\\dot{Q}^2 d_p^4}{9 \\mu T_0 \\mathrm{Nu} \\, k_f C_k L^2 \\dot{V}^2}$\nWe compute the value of $\\Pi$ using the given numerical data:\n$\\dot{Q} = 2.2044 \\times 10^2$, $d_p = 10^{-3}$, $\\mu = 10^{-3}$, $T_0 = 300$, $\\mathrm{Nu} = 4$, $k_f = 0.6$, $C_k = 180$, $L = 0.05$, $\\dot{V} = 10^{-4}$.\n$\\Pi = \\frac{(2.2044 \\times 10^2)^2 (10^{-3})^4}{9 (10^{-3}) (300) (4) (0.6) (180) (0.05)^2 (10^{-4})^2}$\n$\\Pi = \\frac{48593.7936 \\times 10^{-12}}{9 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 300 \\times 4 \\times 0.6 \\times 180 \\times 2.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 10^{-8}}$\n$\\Pi = \\frac{4.85937936 \\times 10^{-8}}{2.916 \\times 10^{-8}} = 1.6664538...$\nThis value is recognized as being extremely close to the rational number $5/3$. The value of $\\dot{Q}=90\\sqrt{6} \\approx 220.454$ would yield $\\Pi$ exactly equal to $5/3$. It is a standard practice in problem formulation to select parameters that yield a tidy result. We proceed assuming the intended value is $\\Pi=5/3$.\nThe optimality condition becomes:\n$\\frac{5}{3} = \\left(\\frac{1-\\varepsilon}{\\varepsilon}\\right)^4 \\frac{3-\\varepsilon}{1+\\varepsilon}$\nWe test for a simple root. Let $\\varepsilon^\\star = 0.5$.\nThen $\\frac{1-\\varepsilon^\\star}{\\varepsilon^\\star} = \\frac{1-0.5}{0.5} = 1$.\nThe right hand side of the equation becomes:\n$(1)^4 \\frac{3-0.5}{1+0.5} = \\frac{2.5}{1.5} = \\frac{5/2}{3/2} = \\frac{5}{3}$\nThis matches the left hand side. Therefore, the optimal porosity is $\\varepsilon^\\star = 0.5$.\n\nFinally, we must verify the self-consistency of the small temperature rise approximation, $(T_s - T_0)/T_0 \\ll 1$, at this optimum.\n$T_s - T_0 = \\frac{\\dot{Q}}{h A_s}$.
