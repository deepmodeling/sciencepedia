Each leg has uniform length $L$ and uniform cross-sectional area, denoted $A_{p}$ and $A_{n}$ for the p-type and n-type legs, respectively. The material properties are constant with temperature and given by the Seebeck coefficients $S_{p}$ and $S_{n}$, the electrical resistivities $\\rho_{p}$ and $\\rho_{n}$, and the thermal conductivities $k_{p}$ and $k_{n}$, all strictly positive.

Before proceeding, the problem statement must be validated.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Thermoelectric couple: one p-type leg, one n-type leg.\n- Electrical connection: series.\n- Thermal connection: parallel.\n- Temperatures: hot side $T_{h}$, cold side $T_{c}$.\n- Temperature difference: $\\Delta T = T_{h} - T_{c}$ (small).\n- Leg geometry: uniform length $L$, cross-sectional areas $A_{p}$ and $A_{n}$.\n- Material properties (constant): Seebeck coefficients $S_{p}$, $S_{n}$; electrical resistivities $\\rho_{p}$, $\\rho_{n}$; thermal conductivities $k_{p}$, $k_{n}$.\n- Property values: `all strictly positive`. The problem also states `The Seebeck coefficients have opposite signs`. This is a slight imprecision in language. Standard convention is that for p-type material $S_{p} > 0$ and for n-type material $S_{n} < 0$. The statement `all strictly positive` is interpreted to apply to the magnitudes of all quantities, with the subsequent sentence clarifying the signs of $S_{p}$ and $S_{n}$. With this interpretation, the physics is sound.\n- Approximations: Neglect Thomson effect, neglect temperature-field perturbation by Joule heating (linear temperature profile), neglect contact resistances.\n- Constraint: Total leg thermal conductance $G_{\\text{leg}} = (k_{p} A_{p} + k_{n} A_{n})/L = G_{0}$.\n- Objective: Find the ratio $r = A_{p}/A_{n}$ that maximizes the maximum electrical power delivered to an external load.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem uses the standard, simplified model for thermoelectric power generation based on the Seebeck effect, Fourier's law of heat conduction, and Ohm's law. The approximations are standard for an introductory analysis. The physical setup is valid.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is a constrained optimization problem: maximizing a function (maximum power) with respect to a variable ($r$) under a well-defined constraint. This structure permits a unique and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated with precise, objective, and formal language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete derivation from fundamental principles will now be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Optimal Area Ratio**\n\nThe analysis will proceed by establishing expressions for the key electrical properties of the couple and then performing a constrained optimization.\n\n$1$. **Open-Circuit Voltage ($V_{oc}$)**\nThe electromotive force (EMF) is a result of the Seebeck effect. With the p-type and n-type legs connected electrically in series, the total open-circuit voltage $V_{oc}$ across the couple is the sum of the individual leg voltages. By convention, $S_{p} > 0$ and $S_{n} < 0$.\n$$V_{oc} = (S_{p} - S_{n}) \\Delta T$$\nSince $S_{p}$ and $S_{n}$ have opposite signs, $|S_{p} - S_{n}| = |S_{p}| + |S_{n}|$. Let $S = S_{p} - S_{n}$ be the effective Seebeck coefficient of the couple. For a fixed $\\Delta T$, $V_{oc}$ is a constant, independent of the leg geometries $A_{p}$ and $A_{n}$, as stated in the problem.\n\n$2$. **Internal Electrical Resistance ($R_{int}$)**\nThe electrical resistance of a uniform conductor is given by $R = \\rho L/A$. Since the legs are in series, their resistances add.\n$$R_{p} = \\frac{\\rho_{p} L}{A_{p}}$$\n$$R_{n} = \\frac{\\rho_{n} L}{A_{n}}$$\nThe total internal resistance of the couple is:\n$$R_{int} = R_{p} + R_{n} = L \\left( \\frac{\\rho_{p}}{A_{p}} + \\frac{\\rho_{n}}{A_{n}} \\right)$$\n\n$3$. **Maximum Electrical Power ($P_{max}$)**\nThe thermoelectric couple acts as a voltage source $V_{oc}$ with internal resistance $R_{int}$. According to the maximum power transfer theorem, maximum power is delivered to an external resistive load $R_{load}$ when $R_{load} = R_{int}$. The value of this maximum power, $P_{max}$, is:\n$$P_{max} = \\frac{V_{oc}^{2}}{4 R_{int}}$$\nTo maximize $P_{max}$ for a fixed $V_{oc}$, one must minimize the total internal resistance $R_{int}$.\n\n$4$. **Optimization under Constraint**\nThe problem is now reduced to minimizing $R_{int}$ subject to the given constraint on thermal conductance.\nThe objective function to minimize is:\n$$R_{int} = L \\left( \\frac{\\rho_{p}}{A_{p}} + \\frac{\\rho_{n}}{A_{n}} \\right)$$\nThe constraint is:\n$$\\frac{k_{p} A_{p} + k_{n} A_{n}}{L} = G_{0}$$\nWe introduce the ratio $r = A_{p}/A_{n}$, which implies $A_{p} = r A_{n}$. We can use the constraint equation to express the areas $A_{p}$ and $A_{n}$ solely in terms of $r$ and the given constants. Substituting $A_{p} = r A_{n}$ into the constraint:\n$$\\frac{k_{p} (r A_{n}) + k_{n} A_{n}}{L} = G_{0}$$\n$$A_{n} (k_{p} r + k_{n}) = L G_{0}$$\nSolving for $A_{n}$ and subsequently for $A_{p}$:\n$$A_{n} = \\frac{L G_{0}}{k_{p} r + k_{n}}$$\n$$A_{p} = r A_{n} = \\frac{r L G_{0}}{k_{p} r + k_{n}}$$\nNow, substitute these expressions for $A_{p}$ and $A_{n}$ into the equation for $R_{int}$:\n$$R_{int} = L \\left( \\frac{\\rho_{p}}{ \\frac{r L G_{0}}{k_{p} r + k_{n}} } + \\frac{\\rho_{n}}{ \\frac{L G_{0}}{k_{p} r + k_{n}} } \\right)$$\n$$R_{int} = L \\left( \\frac{\\rho_{p} (k_{p} r + k_{n})}{r L G_{0}} + \\frac{\\rho_{n} (k_{p} r + k_{n})}{L G_{0}} \\right)$$\n$$R_{int} = \\frac{1}{G_{0}} \\left( \\frac{\\rho_{p}}{r} (k_{p} r + k_{n}) + \\rho_{n} (k_{p} r + k_{n}) \\right)$$\n$$R_{int} = \\frac{1}{G_{0}} \\left( \\rho_{p} k_{p} + \\frac{\\rho_{p} k_{n}}{r} + \\rho_{n} k_{p} r + \\rho_{n} k_{n} \\right)$$\nTo find the value of $r$ that minimizes $R_{int}$, we compute the derivative of $R_{int}$ with respect to $r$ and set it to zero. The terms $\\rho_{p} k_{p}$, $\\rho_{n} k_{n}$, and $G_{0}$ are constants with respect to $r$.\n$$\\frac{d R_{int}}{d r} = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ \\frac{1}{G_{0}} \\left( \\rho_{p} k_{p} + \\rho_{n} k_{n} + \\rho_{n} k_{p} r + \\rho_{p} k_{n} r^{-1} \\right) \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{d R_{int}}{d r} = \\frac{1}{G_{0}} \\left( 0 + 0 + \\rho_{n} k_{p} - \\rho_{p} k_{n} r^{-2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{G_{0}} \\left( \\rho_{n} k_{p} - \\frac{\\rho_{p} k_{n}}{r^{2}} \\right)$$\nSetting the derivative to zero:\n$$\\rho_{n} k_{p} - \\frac{\\rho_{p} k_{n}}{r^{2}} = 0$$\n$$\\rho_{n} k_{p} = \\frac{\\rho_{p} k_{n}}{r^{2}}$$\nSolving for $r^{2}$:\n$$r^{2} = \\frac{\\rho_{p} k_{n}}{\\rho_{n} k_{p}}$$\nSince $r$ is a ratio of physical areas, $r > 0$. We take the positive square root:\n$$r = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_{p} k_{n}}{\\rho_{n} k_{p}}}$$\nTo confirm this is a minimum, we evaluate the second derivative:\n$$\\frac{d^{2} R_{int}}{d r^{2}} = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ \\frac{1}{G_{0}} \\left( \\rho_{n} k_{p} - \\rho_{p} k_{n} r^{-2} \\right) \\right] = \\frac{1}{G_{0}} \\left( - \\rho_{p} k_{n} (-2 r^{-3}) \\right) = \\frac{2 \\rho_{p} k_{n}}{G_{0} r^{3}}$$\nGiven that all material properties $\\rho_{p}, k_{n}$ are strictly positive, and $G_{0}>0$ and $r>0$, the second derivative is always positive. This confirms that the derived value of $r$ corresponds to a minimum of $R_{int}$, and therefore a maximum of $P_{max}$.
