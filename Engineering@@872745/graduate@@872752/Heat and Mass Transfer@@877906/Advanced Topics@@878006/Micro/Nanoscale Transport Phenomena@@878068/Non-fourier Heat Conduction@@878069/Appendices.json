For $\\text{Re}(s)>0$, the real part of the square root term is positive. Thus, the exponential term with the positive argument will grow without bound as $x \\to \\infty$.

By definition, $H(z)=0$ for $z<0$ and $H(z)=1$ for $z>0$. The integral term is also non-zero only for $t > x/c$.\nThis means that for a given position $x>0$, the temperature $T(x,t)$ remains identically zero for all times $t  x/c$. The temperature first becomes non-zero at the precise moment $t = x/c$.\nThis time is the arrival time of the thermal wave front.\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{front}}(x) = \\frac{x}{c} $$\nSubstituting the definition of the wave speed $c = \\sqrt{\\alpha/\\tau}$:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{front}}(x) = x \\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau}{\\alpha}} $$\nThis result demonstrates that the CV model predicts a finite propagation speed, $c$, for thermal disturbances. The effect of the boundary temperature change is not felt instantaneously but propagates as a wave through the medium.\n\n**Classical Fourier Model:**\nThe classical Fourier model is recovered by setting the relaxation time $\\tau = 0$. The governing PDE, $\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\tau}{\\alpha} \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial t^2}$, reduces to the parabolic heat diffusion equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} $$\nThe solution to this equation with the same initial and boundary conditions is a classical result:\n$$ T(x,t) = T_s \\text{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{\\alpha t}}\\right) $$\nwhere $\\text{erfc}$ is the complementary error function. The properties of the $\\text{erfc}$ function are such that $\\text{erfc}(z) > 0$ for any finite argument $z$. For any position $x0$ and any time $t0$, however small, the argument $\\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{\\alpha t}}$ is finite. Therefore, $T(x,t)  0$ for all $x0$ and all $t0$.\nThis signifies that a thermal disturbance at $x=0$ is felt instantly, albeit infinitesimally, at all other points in the domain. The speed of propagation is infinite.\nTherefore, for the classical Fourier model, the front arrival time is:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{front}}(x) = 0 \\quad (\\text{for any } x0) $$\n\n**Comparison:**\n- The Cattaneo–Vernotte model predicts a finite front arrival time $t_{\\mathrm{front}}(x) = x\\sqrt{\\tau/\\alpha}$, corresponding to a finite propagation speed $c = \\sqrt{\\alpha/\\tau}$. This is physically more realistic as it respects causality.\n- The classical Fourier model predicts an instantaneous arrival, $t_{\\mathrm{front}}(x) = 0$, corresponding to an infinite propagation speed. This is a well-known physical paradox of the Fourier model.\n\nThe question asks for the analytic expression for the CV front arrival time, which is the final reported quantity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{x \\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau}{\\alpha}}}\n$$", "id": "2512772"}]}
