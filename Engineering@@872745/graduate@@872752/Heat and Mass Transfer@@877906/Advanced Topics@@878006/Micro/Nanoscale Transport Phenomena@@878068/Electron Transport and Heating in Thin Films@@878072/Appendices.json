An ultrafast optical pulse deposits energy predominantly into the conduction electrons, producing a transiently hot electron distribution that can be described by the Two-Temperature Model (TTM), in which the electron and lattice subsystems are characterized by temperatures $T_{e}$ and $T_{l}$ and volumetric heat capacities $C_{e}(T_{e})$ and $C_{l}(T_{l})$, respectively.

The volumetric heat capacity is defined as $C_{e}(T_{e}) = (\\frac{\\partial u_{e}}{\\partial T_{e}})_{V}$.\n\nFor a degenerate Fermi gas, where the thermal energy is much smaller than the Fermi energy ($k_{B}T_{e} \\ll E_{F}$), we can use the Sommerfeld expansion for the internal energy. The change in internal energy per unit volume from absolute zero is given by:\n$$\\Delta u_{e}(T_{e}) = u_{e}(T_{e}) - u_{e}(0) \\approx \\frac{\\pi^{2}}{6} g_{v}(E_{F}) (k_{B}T_{e})^{2}$$\nwhere $g_{v}(E_{F})$ is the density of states per unit volume at the Fermi energy $E_{F}$.\n\nFor a 3D free electron gas, the density of states per unit volume is $g_{v}(E) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi^{2}} (\\frac{2m_{e}}{\\hbar^{2}})^{3/2} E^{1/2}$. The Fermi energy $E_{F}$ is related to the electron number density $n_{e}$ by $E_{F} = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m_{e}} (3\\pi^{2}n_{e})^{2/3}$. The total number of electrons per unit volume is $n_{e} = \\int_{0}^{E_{F}} g_{v}(E) dE = \\frac{1}{3\\pi^{2}} (\\frac{2m_{e}E_{F}}{\\hbar^{2}})^{3/2}$. From these relations, the density of states at the Fermi energy can be expressed simply in terms of $n_{e}$ and $E_{F}$:\n$$g_{v}(E_{F}) = \\frac{3n_{e}}{2E_{F}}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $g_{v}(E_{F})$ into the equation for $\\Delta u_{e}(T_{e})$:\n$$\\Delta u_{e}(T_{e}) \\approx \\frac{\\pi^{2}}{6} \\left(\\frac{3n_{e}}{2E_{F}}\\right) (k_{B}T_{e})^{2} = \\frac{\\pi^{2}n_{e}k_{B}^{2}}{4E_{F}} T_{e}^{2}$$\nThe electron volumetric heat capacity is then found by differentiating with respect to $T_{e}$:\n$$C_{e}(T_{e}) = \\frac{\\partial(\\Delta u_{e})}{\\partial T_{e}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T_{e}} \\left(\\frac{\\pi^{2}n_{e}k_{B}^{2}}{4E_{F}} T_{e}^{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi^{2}n_{e}k_{B}^{2}}{2E_{F}} T_{e}$$\nThis is the required expression for the electron heat capacity, which is linear in the electron temperature $T_{e}$.\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the lattice volumetric heat capacity $C_{l}(T_{l})$.\n\nThe lattice heat capacity is described by the Debye model. In the high-temperature limit, where the thermal energy is much larger than the energy of typical phonons ($T_{l} \\gg \\Theta_{D}$), the heat capacity of the lattice approaches the classical limit predicted by the Law of Dulong-Petit. According to this law, each of the $3N$ vibrational modes of a solid containing $N$ atoms has an average energy of $k_{B}T_{l}$ due to equipartition. The total internal energy of the lattice is thus $U_{l} \\approx 3Nk_{B}T_{l}$.\nThe heat capacity at constant volume is $C_{V,l} = (\\frac{\\partial U_{l}}{\\partial T_{l}})_{V} = 3Nk_{B}$.\n\nThe volumetric heat capacity $C_{l}$ is obtained by dividing by the volume $V$:\n$$C_{l} = \\frac{3Nk_{B}}{V} = 3n_{a}k_{B}$$\nwhere $n_{a} = N/V$ is the number density of atoms in the solid.\n\nThe problem asks to justify the use of this high-temperature limit for gold at $T_{l} \\approx 300\\ \\text{K}$. The Debye temperature for gold is given as $\\Theta_{D} = 170\\ \\text{K}$. The ratio $T_{l}/\\Theta_{D} = 300/170 \\approx 1.76$. Since $T_{l} > \\Theta_{D}$, the system is in a regime where the Dulong-Petit law is a reasonable approximation. At $T = \\Theta_{D}$, the Debye model predicts a heat capacity that is approximately $96\\%$ of the Dulong-Petit limit $3n_{a}k_{B}$. At $T_l = 1.76\\,\\Theta_D$, the value is even closer to the limit. Thus, we can consider $C_{l}$ to be constant and equal to $3n_{a}k_{B}$ around $300\\ \\text{K}$.\n\nPart 3: Calculation of the crossover electron temperature $T_{e}^{\\ast}$.\n\nThe crossover temperature $T_{e}^{\\ast}$ is defined by the condition $C_{e}(T_{e}^{\\ast}) = C_{l}(T_{l}=300\\ \\text{K})$. Using the expressions derived above:\n$$\\frac{\\pi^{2}n_{e}k_{B}^{2}}{2E_{F}} T_{e}^{\\ast} = 3n_{a}k_{B}$$\nFor gold, a monovalent metal ($z=1$), each atom contributes one conduction electron. Therefore, the electron number density $n_{e}$ is equal to the atom number density $n_{a}$. We can cancel $n_{a}$ (as $n_e=n_a$) and one factor of $k_{B}$ from both sides:\n$$\\frac{\\pi^{2}k_{B}}{2E_{F}} T_{e}^{\\ast} = 3$$\nSolving for $T_{e}^{\\ast}$:\n$$T_{e}^{\\ast} = \\frac{6E_{F}}{\\pi^{2}k_{B}}$$\nTo calculate $T_{e}^{\\ast}$, we first need to find the Fermi energy $E_{F}$ for gold. First, we compute the atom density $n_{a}$:\n$$n_{a} = \\frac{\\rho N_{A}}{M} = \\frac{(19.3\\ \\text{g/cm}^{3}) \\times (10^{6}\\ \\text{cm}^{3}/\\text{m}^{3}) \\times (6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\ \\text{mol}^{-1})}{196.97\\ \\text{g/mol}} = 5.9015 \\times 10^{28}\\ \\text{m}^{-3}$$\nSince $n_{e} = n_{a}$ for gold, we use this value to calculate $E_{F}$:\n$$E_{F} = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m_{e}} (3\\pi^{2}n_{e})^{2/3}$$\n$$E_{F} = \\frac{(1.054571817 \\times 10^{-34}\\ \\text{J s})^{2}}{2(9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31}\\ \\text{kg})} [3\\pi^{2}(5.9015 \\times 10^{28}\\ \\text{m}^{-3})]^{2/3}$$\n$$E_{F} \\approx 8.8522 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\text{J}$$\nNow, we can compute $T_{e}^{\\ast}$:\n$$T_{e}^{\\ast} = \\frac{6 \\times (8.8522 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\text{J})}{\\pi^{2} \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\text{J/K})} \\approx 38978\\ \\text{K}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $T_{e}^{\\ast} = 3.90 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\text{K}$.\n\nQualitative Discussion:\nThe fact that at typical temperatures $C_{e} \\ll C_{l}$ is central to the two-temperature dynamics. After an ultrafast laser pulse, energy is almost instantaneously absorbed by the electrons. Because their heat capacity is so small, their temperature $T_e$ can rise to many thousands of kelvin while the lattice temperature $T_l$ remains near the initial temperature. The energy then equilibrates between the electron and lattice subsystems on a timescale governed by the electron-phonon coupling strength.\nThe calculated crossover temperature $T_{e}^{\\ast} \\approx 39000\\ \\text{K}$ is exceptionally high. Gold melts at $1337\\ \\text{K}$ and boils at $3129\\ \\text{K}$. Long before the electron temperature could reach $T_{e}^{\\ast}$, the energy transferred to the lattice would be sufficient to melt, vaporize, and even ionize the material, completely destroying the solid-state structure. Therefore, in experiments on gold thin films that do not result in material ablation or plasma formation, this crossover condition is never reached. The inequality $C_{e}(T_{e}) < C_{l}$ holds throughout the entire relevant temperature range for the solid phase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.90 \\times 10^{4}}$$", "id": "2481650"}, {"introduction": "The dynamics of thermal relaxation in thin films involve processes occurring on vastly different timescales.

Since $0.0361 < 0.1$, the lattice contribution to thermal conductivity can be neglected at this temperature according to the given criterion.\n\nCase 2: $T = 2000\\,\\mathrm{K}$\nThe provided data are:\n$\\rho_{\\mathrm{bulk}}(2000\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 2.2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\Omega\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$l_{e,\\mathrm{bulk}}(2000\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$l_{U}(2000\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 5\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\nr(2000\\,\\mathrm{K}) = \\frac{(3.6 \\times 10^{3}) (2.2 \\times 10^{-6})}{(2.44 \\times 10^{-8}) (2000)^{2}} \\frac{(40 + 1.5) \\times 10^{-9}}{(40 + 5) \\times 10^{-9}}\n$$\n$$\nr(2000\\,\\mathrm{K}) = \\frac{7.92 \\times 10^{-3}}{2.44 \\times 10^{-8} \\times 4 \\times 10^{6}} \\frac{41.5}{45} = \\frac{7.92 \\times 10^{-3}}{9.76 \\times 10^{-2}} \\frac{41.5}{45}\n$$\n$$\nr(2000\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx (0.081148) \\times (0.92222) \\approx 0.074836\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, $r(2000\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.0748$. Since $0.0748 < 0.1$, the lattice contribution can also be neglected at this higher temperature, although its relative importance has more than doubled compared to room temperature.\n\nIn both cases, the criterion $r(T) < 0.1$ is satisfied, justifying the neglect of $k_{\\ell}$ in the heat conduction term for this particular thin film under these conditions.\nThe final result is the two calculated ratios.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{bmatrix} 0.0361 & 0.0748 \\end{bmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2481534"}]}
