Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the Schmidt number, the derivation of a scaling law for the ratio of boundary layer thicknesses, and the evaluation of this ratio for the given fluid properties.\n\nFirst, we address Task 1: computation of the Schmidt number, $Sc$.\nThe Schmidt number is defined as the ratio of momentum diffusivity (kinematic viscosity), $\\nu$, to mass diffusivity, $D$.\n$$Sc = \\frac{\\nu}{D}$$\nThe problem provides the following values: $\\nu \\approx 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}$ and $D \\approx 2.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}$.\nSubstituting these values into the definition:\n$$Sc = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}} = \\frac{1.5}{2.0} = 0.75$$\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures. Thus, we write $Sc = 0.7500$.\n\nSecond, we address Task 2: derivation of the scaling law $\\delta_c(x)/\\delta(x) \\sim Sc^{-n}$ and determination of the exponent $n$.\nThe analysis begins with the steady, two-dimensional, laminar boundary layer equations for an incompressible fluid with constant properties and zero pressure gradient.\nThe continuity equation is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 0$$\nThe momentum equation in the streamwise ($x$) direction is:\n$$u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}$$\nThe species conservation (convection-diffusion) equation for a dilute, passive scalar is:\n$$u \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial y^2}$$\nHere, $u$ and $v$ are the velocity components in the $x$ (streamwise) and $y$ (wall-normal) directions, respectively.\n\nFrom a standard order-of-magnitude analysis of the momentum equation, the inertial terms on the left-hand side are balanced by the viscous term on the right-hand side. This leads to the well-known scaling for the hydrodynamic boundary layer thickness, $\\delta(x)$:\n$$\\frac{U_{\\infty}^2}{x} \\sim \\nu \\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\delta^2} \\implies \\delta^2(x) \\sim \\frac{\\nu x}{U_{\\infty}}$$\n$$\\delta(x) \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu x}{U_{\\infty}}}$$\n\nTo derive the scaling for the concentration boundary layer thickness, $\\delta_c(x)$, we perform an order-of-magnitude analysis of the species conservation equation. This requires an understanding of the velocity field within the concentration boundary layer. The nature of this velocity field depends on the ratio of $\\delta_c$ to $\\delta$, which is governed by the Schmidt number. The problem's mention of \"near-wall linearization\" correctly suggests we should analyze the case where the concentration boundary layer is embedded within the hydrodynamic boundary layer, which is valid for $Sc \\gtrsim 1$. In this regime, $\\delta_c \\ll \\delta$.\n\nWithin the hydrodynamic boundary layer, near the wall ($y \\ll \\delta$), the velocity profile is approximately linear. This is the \"near-wall linearization\". The wall shear stress is $\\tau_w = \\mu (\\partial u / \\partial y)_{y=0}$. From scaling, $\\tau_w \\sim \\mu U_{\\infty}/\\delta$. Thus, the velocity gradient at the wall scales as $(\\partial u / \\partial y)_{y=0} \\sim U_{\\infty}/\\delta$. The linearized velocity profile near the wall is therefore:\n$$u(y) \\sim \\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\delta} y$$\nSince we assume $\\delta_c \\ll \\delta$, this linear velocity profile is valid throughout the entire concentration boundary layer. The characteristic streamwise velocity within the concentration boundary layer (at $y \\sim \\delta_c$) is:\n$$u_c \\sim \\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\delta} \\delta_c$$\nNow, we apply an order-of-magnitude balance to the species equation within the layer of thickness $\\delta_c$.

This scaling is known to be a very good approximation for $Sc \\ge 0.6$.\n\nThird, we address Task 3: evaluation of the numerical value of $\\delta_c/\\delta$.\nThe derived scaling law, $\\delta_c/\\delta \\sim Sc^{-1/3}$, provides the functional dependence. For $Sc$ values not drastically different from unity, the constant of proportionality is approximately $1$. A more detailed analysis based on the similarity solution confirms that for $Sc \\ge 0.6$, the relation can be written as an approximate equality:\n$$\\frac{\\delta_c}{\\delta} \\approx Sc^{-1/3}$$\nOur computed Schmidt number is $Sc = 0.75$, which lies in the range of validity for this approximation.

We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to first derive an expression for the Sherwood number, $Sh$, based on the provided experimental quantities, and then to calculate the combined relative standard uncertainty in this derived value.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental relationships. The interfacial molar mass flux, $j$, from a surface to a bulk fluid is defined in terms of a mass transfer coefficient, $k_c$, and the concentration difference between the surface, $C_s$, and the bulk, $C_b$. This relationship is given by:\n$$ j = k_c (C_s - C_b) $$\nThe problem states that $j$, $C_s$, and $C_b$ are measured or known. We can therefore express the mass transfer coefficient, $k_c$, in terms of these quantities. Let $\\Delta C = C_s - C_b$.\n$$ k_c = \\frac{j}{\\Delta C} $$\nThe Sherwood number, $Sh$, is a dimensionless group that represents the ratio of convective mass transfer to diffusive mass transfer. It is defined as:\n$$ Sh = \\frac{k_c L}{D} $$\nwhere $L$ is a characteristic length and $D$ is the molecular diffusivity of the solute.\n\nBy substituting the expression for $k_c$ into the definition of the Sherwood number, we obtain the form of $Sh$ as inferred from this experiment:\n$$ Sh = \\left( \\frac{j}{\\Delta C} \\right) \\frac{L}{D} = \\frac{jL}{D \\Delta C} $$\nThis expression relates the dimensionless Sherwood number to the experimentally determined quantities.\n\nNext, we must propagate the uncertainties from the measured variables to the calculated Sherwood number. The problem specifies that the uncertainties in the characteristic length, $L$, and the concentrations, $C_s$ and $C_b$ (and thus $\\Delta C$), are negligible. The quantities with non-negligible standard uncertainties are the molar flux, $j$ (with uncertainty $u_j$), and the diffusivity, $D$ (with uncertainty $u_D$). The problem also states that the measurements of $j$ and $D$ are statistically independent.\n\nFor a function $Y = f(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_N)$ of independent variables $X_i$ with standard uncertainties $u_{X_i}$, the combined standard uncertainty in $Y$, denoted $u_Y$, is given by the law of propagation of uncertainty:\n$$ u_Y^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial X_i} \\right)^2 u_{X_i}^2 $$\nIn our case, the function is $Sh(j, D) = \\frac{jL}{D \\Delta C}$.

This requires minimizing the individual relative standard uncertainties $\\frac{u_j}{j}$ and $\\frac{u_D}{D}$.\n\nTo minimize $\\frac{u_j}{j}$: The flux $j$ is measured via a gravimetric balance, so $j = \\frac{\\Delta m}{A \\cdot \\Delta t}$, where $\\Delta m$ is the mass accumulated on area $A$ in time $\\Delta t$. If the primary source of uncertainty in $j$ is the standard uncertainty of the mass measurement, $u_{\\Delta m}$, which is often a fixed instrument limit, then $u_j \\approx \\frac{u_{\\Delta m}}{A \\cdot \\Delta t}$. The relative uncertainty is then $\\frac{u_j}{j} = \\frac{u_{\\Delta m}/(A \\cdot \\Delta t)}{\\Delta m / (A \\cdot \\Delta t)} = \\frac{u_{\\Delta m}}{\\Delta m}$. To minimize this ratio, one must maximize the accumulated mass, $\\Delta m = j \\cdot A \\cdot \\Delta t$. This can be achieved by:\n$1$. Increasing the experimental duration, $\\Delta t$.\n$2$. Increasing the capture surface area, $A$.\n$3$. Increasing the mass flux, $j$, by either using a larger concentration driving force, $\\Delta C = C_s - C_b$, or by increasing the mass transfer coefficient, $k_c$, for example, by increasing the fluid velocity (while maintaining laminar flow as per the problem statement).\n\nTo minimize $\\frac{u_D}{D}$: This uncertainty arises from the independent characterization of diffusivity. Its minimization depends on the chosen method (e.g., Taylor dispersion, dynamic light scattering, diaphragm cell). General strategies include:\n$1$. Using a high-precision measurement technique.\n$2$. Implementing precise temperature control, as diffusivity is strongly temperature-dependent (often following the Stokes-Einstein relation).\n$3$. Performing multiple replicate measurements to reduce the standard error of the mean.\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the current experiment is instructive. The contribution of each source to the total variance of the relative uncertainty is proportional to its square. The variance from flux is $(\\frac{u_j}{j})^2 = (0.0200)^2 = 0.000400$. The variance from diffusivity is $(\\frac{u_D}{D})^2 = (0.0400)^2 = 0.001600$. The total variance is $0.002000$. The uncertainty in diffusivity contributes $\\frac{0.001600}{0.002000} = 80\\%$ of the total variance, while the uncertainty in flux contributes only $20\\%$. Therefore, to most effectively reduce the overall uncertainty in $Sh$, experimental effort should be prioritized on obtaining a more precise value for the diffusivity, $D$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.04472}$$", "id": "2477329"}]}
