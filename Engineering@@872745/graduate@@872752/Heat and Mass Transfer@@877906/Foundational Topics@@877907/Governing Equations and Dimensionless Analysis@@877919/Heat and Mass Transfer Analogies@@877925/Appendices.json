The Reynolds Analogy:\nThe Reynolds analogy postulates a direct proportionality between momentum transfer and heat transfer, expressed as the equality of the Stanton number, $\\mathrm{St}$, and half the Fanning friction factor, $f/2$.\n$$\\mathrm{St}_{\\mathrm{Reynolds}} = \\frac{f}{2}$$\nUsing the general identity $\\mathrm{Nu} = \\mathrm{St} \\cdot \\mathrm{Re} \\cdot \\mathrm{Pr}$, the Nusselt number predicted by the Reynolds analogy is:\n$$\\mathrm{Nu}_{\\mathrm{Reynolds}} = \\mathrm{St}_{\\mathrm{Reynolds}} \\cdot \\mathrm{Re} \\cdot \\mathrm{Pr} = \\left(\\frac{f}{2}\\right) \\mathrm{Re} \\cdot \\mathrm{Pr}$$\nThe problem supplies the Blasius correlation for the friction factor, $f = 0.079\\,\\mathrm{Re}^{-0.25}$.

The Chilton–Colburn Analogy:\nThe Chilton–Colburn analogy provides a more accurate correlation for fluids with $\\mathrm{Pr} \\neq 1$ by introducing a correction factor involving the Prandtl number. It is expressed via the Colburn j-factor for heat transfer, $j_H = \\mathrm{St} \\cdot \\mathrm{Pr}^{2/3}$, as:\n$$j_H = \\mathrm{St}_{\\mathrm{CC}} \\cdot \\mathrm{Pr}^{2/3} = \\frac{f}{2}$$\nFrom this, we can express the Stanton number for the Chilton–Colburn case:\n$$\\mathrm{St}_{\\mathrm{CC}} = \\frac{f/2}{\\mathrm{Pr}^{2/3}}$$\nUsing the general identity $\\mathrm{Nu} = \\mathrm{St} \\cdot \\mathrm{Re} \\cdot \\mathrm{Pr}$ again, the Nusselt number from the Chilton–Colburn analogy is:\n$$\\mathrm{Nu}_{\\mathrm{CC}} = \\mathrm{St}_{\\mathrm{CC}} \\cdot \\mathrm{Re} \\cdot \\mathrm{Pr} = \\left(\\frac{f/2}{\\mathrm{Pr}^{2/3}}\\right) \\mathrm{Re} \\cdot \\mathrm{Pr}$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\\mathrm{Nu}_{\\mathrm{CC}} = \\left(\\frac{f}{2}\\right) \\mathrm{Re} \\cdot \\mathrm{Pr}^{1 - 2/3} = \\left(\\frac{f}{2}\\right) \\mathrm{Re} \\cdot \\mathrm{Pr}^{1/3}$$\nSubstituting the Blasius correlation for $f$ gives:\n$$\\mathrm{Nu}_{\\mathrm{CC}} = \\left(\\frac{0.079\\,\\mathrm{Re}^{-0.25}}{2}\\right) \\mathrm{Re} \\cdot \\mathrm{Pr}^{1/3} = 0.0395\\,\\mathrm{Re}^{0.75} \\mathrm{Pr}^{1/3}$$\n\nNow we derive the requested ratio, $R = \\mathrm{Nu}_{\\mathrm{Reynolds}}/\\mathrm{Nu}_{\\mathrm{CC}}$.

This cancellation shows that the ratio $R$ is independent of the Reynolds number and the specific friction factor correlation, as long as the same friction factor is used in both analogies.\nThe simplified analytic expression for the ratio $R$ is therefore dependent only on the Prandtl number, $\\mathrm{Pr}$:\n$$R = \\frac{\\mathrm{Pr}}{\\mathrm{Pr}^{1/3}} = \\mathrm{Pr}^{1 - 1/3} = \\mathrm{Pr}^{2/3}$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate this ratio for the given Prandtl number, $\\mathrm{Pr} = 7.00$:\n$$R = (7.00)^{2/3}$$\nCalculating this value:\n$$R \\approx 3.6593057$$\nThe problem requests the result to four significant figures.\n$$R \\approx 3.659$$\nThis result shows that for a fluid with $\\mathrm{Pr} = 7.00$, the simple Reynolds analogy overpredicts the heat transfer rate by a factor of approximately $3.659$ compared to the more accurate Chilton–Colburn analogy.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{3.659} $$", "id": "2492096"}, {"introduction": "While the Chilton-Colburn analogy offers a significant improvement, it is still an approximation rooted in the assumption that turbulent eddies transport heat and momentum with equal efficiency.

It presents a standard exercise in convective heat transfer theory, allowing for a direct and logical solution. We will proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe problem requires a multistep derivation and comparison of the Nusselt number, $\\mathrm{Nu}$, for turbulent flow in a pipe using different models.\n\nTask 1: Derive an expression for $\\mathrm{Nu}$ from the Chilton–Colburn analogy.\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental definitions provided. The Stanton number for heat transfer is $\\mathrm{St} \\equiv \\dfrac{h}{\\rho c_{p} u_{b}}$, and the Nusselt number is $\\mathrm{Nu} \\equiv \\dfrac{h D}{k}$. We must establish a relationship between these two dimensionless groups. To do this, we introduce the definitions of the Reynolds number, $\\mathrm{Re} \\equiv \\dfrac{\\rho u_{b} D}{\\mu}$, and the Prandtl number, $\\mathrm{Pr} \\equiv \\dfrac{c_{p} \\mu}{k}$.\n\nBy forming the product of the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers, we find:\n$$\\mathrm{Re} \\, \\mathrm{Pr} = \\left(\\frac{\\rho u_{b} D}{\\mu}\\right) \\left(\\frac{c_{p} \\mu}{k}\\right) = \\frac{\\rho u_{b} D c_{p}}{k}$$\nWe can now express the Nusselt number as a function of these groups by dividing $\\mathrm{Nu}$ by the product $\\mathrm{Re} \\, \\mathrm{Pr}$:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{Nu}}{\\mathrm{Re} \\, \\mathrm{Pr}} = \\frac{h D / k}{\\rho u_{b} D c_{p} / k} = \\frac{h}{\\rho c_{p} u_{b}}$$\nThe right-hand side is the definition of the Stanton number, $\\mathrm{St}$. Therefore, we have the identity:\n$$\\mathrm{St} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Nu}}{\\mathrm{Re} \\, \\mathrm{Pr}}$$\nThe problem states that the Chilton–Colburn analogy equates the heat transfer $j$-factor, $j_{H}$, to the momentum transfer $j$-factor. The heat transfer $j$-factor is defined as $j_{H} \\equiv \\mathrm{St} \\, \\mathrm{Pr}^{2/3}$. The appropriate momentum transfer $j$-factor for pipe flow is defined in terms of the Fanning friction factor, $f_{F}$, as $j_{M} \\equiv \\dfrac{f_{F}}{2}$.\n\nThe Chilton–Colburn analogy is therefore expressed as $j_{H} = j_{M}$, which becomes:\n$$\\mathrm{St} \\, \\mathrm{Pr}^{2/3} = \\frac{f_{F}}{2}$$\nThe problem provides the Darcy friction factor, $f_{D}$, and the relation $f_{D} = 4 f_{F}$. We must express the analogy in terms of $f_{D}$ by substituting $f_{F} = \\dfrac{f_{D}}{4}$:\n$$\\mathrm{St} \\, \\mathrm{Pr}^{2/3} = \\frac{f_{D}/4}{2} = \\frac{f_{D}}{8}$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $\\mathrm{St}$ in terms of $\\mathrm{Nu}$, $\\mathrm{Re}$, and $\\mathrm{Pr}$ into this analogy equation:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{Nu}}{\\mathrm{Re} \\, \\mathrm{Pr}}\\right) \\mathrm{Pr}^{2/3} = \\frac{f_{D}}{8}$$\nFinally, we solve for the Nusselt number, $\\mathrm{Nu}$:\n$$\\mathrm{Nu} = \\left(\\frac{f_{D}}{8}\\right) \\mathrm{Re} \\, \\mathrm{Pr} \\, \\mathrm{Pr}^{-2/3} = \\left(\\frac{f_{D}}{8}\\right) \\mathrm{Re} \\, \\mathrm{Pr}^{1/3}$$\nThis is the explicit expression for $\\mathrm{Nu}$ implied by the Chilton–Colburn analogy.\n\nTask 2: Evaluate $\\mathrm{Nu}$ using the Chilton–Colburn analogy.\nWe use the expression derived in Task 1 with the given numerical values: $\\mathrm{Re} = 1.0 \\times 10^{5}$, $\\mathrm{Pr} = 5.00$, and $f_{D} = 0.0180$.\n$$\\mathrm{Nu}_{CC} = \\left(\\frac{0.0180}{8}\\right) (1.0 \\times 10^{5}) (5.00)^{1/3}$$\n$$\\mathrm{Nu}_{CC} = (0.00225) (1.0 \\times 10^{5}) (5.00)^{1/3}$$\n$$\\mathrm{Nu}_{CC} \\approx 225 \\times 1.709976 \\approx 384.7446$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the Nusselt number predicted by the Chilton–Colburn analogy is $385$.\n\nTask 3: Evaluate $\\mathrm{Nu}$ using the Dittus–Boelter correlation.\nThe problem instructs us to use the Dittus–Boelter correlation for heating of the fluid, which is a widely known empirical formula:\n$$\\mathrm{Nu}_{DB} = 0.023 \\, \\mathrm{Re}^{0.8} \\, \\mathrm{Pr}^{0.4}$$\nThis correlation is applicable for the given conditions ($\\mathrm{Re} = 10^{5} \\gtrsim 10^{4}$ and $\\mathrm{Pr} = 5.00$ is within the range $0.7 \\lesssim \\mathrm{Pr} \\lesssim 160$).

The Dittus–Boelter correlation, being an empirical fit to extensive experimental data, is considered more accurate for this specific case.\n\nThe Chilton–Colburn analogy is a simplification based on the Reynolds analogy, which fundamentally assumes that the turbulent transport mechanisms for momentum and heat are identical. This implies that the eddy diffusivity for momentum, $\\nu_{t}$, is equal to the eddy diffusivity for heat, $\\alpha_{t}$. The ratio of these diffusivities is the turbulent Prandtl number, $\\mathrm{Pr}_{t} \\equiv \\dfrac{\\nu_{t}}{\\alpha_{t}}$. The simple Chilton-Colburn analogy implicitly assumes $\\mathrm{Pr}_{t} = 1$.\n\nIn reality, for fluids with molecular Prandtl number $\\mathrm{Pr} > 1$ (such as water or, in this case, a fluid with $\\mathrm{Pr}=5.00$), experimental evidence shows that turbulent eddies are slightly more effective at transporting heat than momentum, meaning $\\alpha_{t} > \\nu_{t}$. This results in a turbulent Prandtl number $\\mathrm{Pr}_{t} < 1$. Typical values for pipe flow are in the range of $0.85$ to $0.9$.\n\nThe problem provides a generalized analogy that accounts for this effect:\n$$\\mathrm{Nu} = \\left(\\frac{f_{D}}{8}\\right) \\mathrm{Re}\\, \\mathrm{Pr}^{1/3} \\, \\mathrm{Pr}_{t}^{-2/3}$$\nThis can be written as $\\mathrm{Nu} = \\mathrm{Nu}_{CC} \\cdot \\mathrm{Pr}_{t}^{-2/3}$. Since for this flow $\\mathrm{Pr}_{t} < 1$, the correction factor $\\mathrm{Pr}_{t}^{-2/3}$ is greater than $1$, leading to a higher, more accurate $\\mathrm{Nu}$ prediction than the simple analogy. This is consistent with our finding that $\\mathrm{Nu}_{DB} > \\mathrm{Nu}_{CC}$.\n\nWe can estimate an effective $\\mathrm{Pr}_{t}$ that reconciles the generalized analogy with the more accurate Dittus–Boelter value by setting $\\mathrm{Nu} = \\mathrm{Nu}_{DB}$:\n$$\\mathrm{Nu}_{DB} = \\mathrm{Nu}_{CC} \\cdot \\mathrm{Pr}_{t}^{-2/3}$$\nSolving for $\\mathrm{Pr}_{t}$:\n$$\\mathrm{Pr}_{t}^{-2/3} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Nu}_{DB}}{\\mathrm{Nu}_{CC}}$$\n$$\\mathrm{Pr}_{t} = \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{Nu}_{DB}}{\\mathrm{Nu}_{CC}}\\right)^{-3/2} = \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{Nu}_{CC}}{\\mathrm{Nu}_{DB}}\\right)^{3/2}$$\nUsing the unrounded values for better precision:\n$$\\mathrm{Pr}_{t} = \\left(\\frac{384.7446}{437.8404}\\right)^{3/2} \\approx (0.87873)^{3/2} \\approx 0.8245$$\nThis estimated value of $\\mathrm{Pr}_{t} \\approx 0.82$ is physically reasonable and consistent with the theoretical expectation that $\\mathrm{Pr}_t < 1$ for this type of flow, providing a mechanistic explanation for the discrepancy between the simple analogy and the empirical correlation.\nThe final answer required is the result of Task 2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{385}$$", "id": "2492137"}, {"introduction": "Modern heat transfer analysis often relies on complex, empirically-derived correlations that are best evaluated computationally.

We begin with the provided definitions.\n\nThe Chilton–Colburn factor is defined as:\n$$ j_H = \\mathrm{St} \\cdot \\mathrm{Pr}^{2/3} $$\nwhere $\\mathrm{St}$ is the Stanton number. The Stanton number is defined as:\n$$ \\mathrm{St} = \\frac{h}{\\rho\\,c_p\\,u} $$\nHere, $h$ is the heat transfer coefficient, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $c_p$ is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure, and $u$ is the mean fluid velocity.\n\nOur goal is to express $\\mathrm{St}$ using only $\\mathrm{Nu}$, $\\mathrm{Re}$, and $\\mathrm{Pr}$. We utilize the definitions of these dimensionless numbers:\n$$ \\mathrm{Nu} = \\frac{h\\,D}{k} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{\\rho\\,u\\,D}{\\mu} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Pr} = \\frac{\\mu\\,c_p}{k} $$\nwhere $D$ is the tube diameter, $k$ is the thermal conductivity, and $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity.\n\nA well-known and useful identity can be formed by taking the ratio of the Nusselt number to the product of the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{Nu}}{\\mathrm{Re} \\cdot \\mathrm{Pr}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{h\\,D}{k}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{\\rho\\,u\\,D}{\\mu}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\mu\\,c_p}{k}\\right)} $$\nSimplifying the denominator gives:\n$$ \\mathrm{Re} \\cdot \\mathrm{Pr} = \\frac{\\rho\\,u\\,D\\,c_p}{k} $$\nSubstituting this back into the ratio, we find:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{Nu}}{\\mathrm{Re} \\cdot \\mathrm{Pr}} = \\frac{h\\,D/k}{\\rho\\,u\\,D\\,c_p/k} = \\frac{h\\,D}{k} \\cdot \\frac{k}{\\rho\\,u\\,D\\,c_p} = \\frac{h}{\\rho\\,u\\,c_p} $$\nThis resulting expression is precisely the definition of the Stanton number, $\\mathrm{St}$.

Calculate the final ratio, $r$, defined as the comparison between the computed $j_H$ and half the Darcy friction factor:\n    $$ r = \\frac{j_H}{f/2} $$\n\nThe simple Chilton-Colburn analogy posits that $j_H \\approx f/8$. If this analogy were exact, the ratio $r$ would be $r = (f/8)/(f/2) = 1/4 = 0.25$. The computed value of $r$ therefore quantifies the deviation of the more accurate Gnielinski correlation from a scaled version of this simple analogy.
