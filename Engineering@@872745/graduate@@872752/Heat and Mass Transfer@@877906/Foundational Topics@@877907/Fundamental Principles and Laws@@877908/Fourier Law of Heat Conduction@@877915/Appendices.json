The problem is a canonical exercise in one-dimensional, steady-state heat conduction with internal heat generation. It is scientifically grounded in the first law of thermodynamics (conservation of energy) and Fourier's law of heat conduction. The problem is well-posed: it provides a second-order ordinary differential equation with two specified boundary conditions, which guarantees the existence of a unique, stable solution. The language is objective and precise, with all necessary parameters ($\\dot{q}$, $k$, $L$, $T_{s}$) defined. The assumptions, such as constant thermal conductivity and perfectly isothermal boundaries, are standard idealizations used to make the problem analytically tractable and are physically reasonable approximations in many engineering contexts. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, ill-posed, trivial, or unverifiable.\n\nThe verdict is that the problem is valid. A solution will now be constructed.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation starting from the principle of local conservation of energy. For a one-dimensional system at steady state, the general heat diffusion equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} q_x(x) = \\dot{q}\n$$\nwhere $q_x(x)$ is the local heat flux in the $x$-direction and $\\dot{q}$ is the volumetric rate of heat generation. The problem specifies a linear constitutive relation, which is Fourier's law of heat conduction:\n$$\nq_x = -k \\frac{dT}{dx}\n$$\nHere, $k$ is the thermal conductivity and $\\frac{dT}{dx}$ is the temperature gradient. Substituting Fourier's law into the energy conservation equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(-k \\frac{dT}{dx}\\right) = \\dot{q}\n$$\nGiven that the thermal conductivity $k$ is constant, it can be taken outside the derivative:\n$$\n-k \\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} = \\dot{q}\n$$\nRearranging this gives the governing second-order ordinary differential equation for the temperature $T(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\dot{q}}{k}\n$$\nTo find the temperature field $T(x)$, we integrate this equation twice with respect to $x$. The first integration gives the temperature gradient:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dx} = -\\frac{\\dot{q}}{k}x + C_1\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ is the first constant of integration. The second integration yields the general solution for the temperature profile:\n$$\nT(x) = -\\frac{\\dot{q}}{2k}x^2 + C_1x + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_2$ is the second constant of integration. These two constants, $C_1$ and $C_2$, are determined by applying the boundary conditions provided in the problem statement.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1. At $x=0$, the temperature is $T_s$: $T(0) = T_s$.\n2. At $x=L$, the temperature is $T_s$: $T(L) = T_s$.\n\nApplying the first boundary condition, $T(0) = T_s$:\n$$\nT(0) = -\\frac{\\dot{q}}{2k}(0)^2 + C_1(0) + C_2 = T_s\n$$\nThis immediately gives $C_2 = T_s$.\n\nNow, applying the second boundary condition, $T(L) = T_s$, and substituting $C_2 = T_s$:\n$$\nT(L) = -\\frac{\\dot{q}}{2k}L^2 + C_1L + T_s = T_s\n$$\nSimplifying this equation allows us to solve for $C_1$:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\dot{q}}{2k}L^2 + C_1L = 0\n$$\n$$\nC_1L = \\frac{\\dot{q}L^2}{2k}\n$$\nAssuming $L \\neq 0$, which is physically required for a slab to exist, we find:\n$$\nC_1 = \\frac{\\dot{q}L}{2k}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the determined constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ back into the general solution for $T(x)$:\n$$\nT(x) = -\\frac{\\dot{q}}{2k}x^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\dot{q}L}{2k}\\right)x + T_s\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the temperature field. It can be conveniently rewritten by factoring out common terms:\n$$\nT(x) = \\frac{\\dot{q}}{2k}(Lx - x^2) + T_s\n$$\nThis expression describes a parabolic temperature distribution across the slab.\n\nNext, we must determine the location of the maximum temperature, $x_{\\max}$. The maximum temperature occurs at the point where the temperature gradient is zero, i.e., $\\frac{dT}{dx} = 0$. Using our expression for the temperature gradient:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dx} = -\\frac{\\dot{q}}{k}x + C_1 = -\\frac{\\dot{q}}{k}x + \\frac{\\dot{q}L}{2k}\n$$\nSetting this to zero at $x = x_{\\max}$:\n$$\n0 = -\\frac{\\dot{q}}{k}x_{\\max} + \\frac{\\dot{q}L}{2k}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\dot{q}}{k}x_{\\max} = \\frac{\\dot{q}L}{2k}\n$$\nSolving for $x_{\\max}$ yields:\n$$\nx_{\\max} = \\frac{L}{2}\n$$\nThis result is expected, as the problem is symmetric with respect to both geometry and boundary conditions. The maximum temperature must occur at the midpoint of the slab.\n\nFinally, we determine the value of this maximum temperature, $T_{\\max}$, by evaluating the temperature field $T(x)$ at $x = x_{\\max} = \\frac{L}{2}$:\n$$\nT_{\\max} = T\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\dot{q}}{2k}\\left(L\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right)^2\\right) + T_s\n$$\n$$\nT_{\\max} = \\frac{\\dot{q}}{2k}\\left(\\frac{L^2}{2} - \\frac{L^2}{4}\\right) + T_s\n$$\n$$\nT_{\\max} = \\frac{\\dot{q}}{2k}\\left(\\frac{L^2}{4}\\right) + T_s\n$$\n$$\nT_{\\max} = \\frac{\\dot{q}L^2}{8k} + T_s\n$$\nThis expression gives the maximum temperature in the slab as a function of the given parameters.\n\nThe three required results have been derived: the temperature field $T(x)$, the location of maximum temperature $x_{\\max}$, and the maximum temperature $T_{\\max}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\dot{q}}{2k}(Lx - x^2) + T_s & \\frac{L}{2} & T_s + \\frac{\\dot{q}L^2}{8k} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2489779"}, {"introduction": "Having mastered the isotropic case, we now explore materials where properties are direction-dependent.

It presents a standard problem in the continuum mechanics of heat transfer for an anisotropic solid, providing all necessary physical parameters and mathematical structures.

For a conducting material, it is strictly positive definite. Furthermore, for materials without exotic coupling effects, Onsager's reciprocal relations require $\\mathbf{K}$ to be symmetric, i.e., $k_{ij} = k_{ji}$.\n\nThe problem states that the material exhibits transverse isotropy about a preferred direction, specified by the unit vector $\\mathbf{n}$.
