Round your final numerical answer to four significant figures and express it in kJ/K.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard thermodynamic process for which a unique solution can be found using fundamental principles. The problem requires the computation of the entropy change of a system and a justification for the method used.\n\nFirst, the justification for using a reversible path is addressed. Entropy, denoted by $S$, is a thermodynamic property. A property is a characteristic of a system's state, and thus a change in any property, such as $\\Delta S = S_{2} - S_{1}$, depends only on the initial (State $1$) and final (State $2$) equilibrium states. The change is independent of the path or process connecting these states. The actual process is an irreversible adiabatic stirring of the air. For any process, the entropy change of a closed system is related to heat transfer and entropy generation by the equation:\n$$ \\Delta S_{\\text{system}} = \\int_{1}^{2} \\frac{\\delta Q}{T_{b}} + S_{\\text{gen}} $$\nHere, $T_{b}$ is the temperature at the boundary where heat transfer $\\delta Q$ occurs, and $S_{\\text{gen}}$ is the entropy generated due to irreversibilities within the system. The tank is well-insulated, so there is no heat transfer with the surroundings, which means $\\delta Q = 0$. The process is stated to be highly irreversible, so $S_{\\text{gen}} > 0$. Consequently, the entropy change of the air is equal to the entropy generated, $\\Delta S = S_{\\text{gen}} > 0$.\n\nTo calculate the numerical value of $\\Delta S$, which is the state change $S_{2} - S_{1}$, we do not need to analyze the complex irreversible path. Instead, we can devise any convenient, completely reversible path that connects the identical initial State $1$ and final State $2$. The entropy change calculated for this fictitious reversible path will be exactly the same as for the actual irreversible process, because the endpoints are the same. A reversible path is chosen because the fundamental definition of entropy change is based on it:\n$$ \\Delta S = \\int_{1}^{2} \\left(\\frac{\\delta Q}{T}\\right)_{\\text{rev}} $$\nThis integral must be evaluated along a reversible path.\n\nThe initial state (State $1$) of the air is given by $T_{1} = 300~\\text{K}$ and $p_{1} = 1.00~\\text{bar}$. The final state (State $2$) is characterized by the temperature $T_{2} = 600~\\text{K}$. The process occurs in a rigid tank, meaning the specific volume and total volume are constant ($v_{2} = v_{1}$ and $V_{2} = V_{1}$).\n\nThe change in specific entropy, $\\Delta s = s_{2} - s_{1}$, for an ideal gas can be expressed using the second T-ds relation, $Tds = dh - vdp$. For an ideal gas, the change in specific enthalpy is $dh = c_{p}(T)dT$ and the ideal gas law gives $v/T = R/p$. Integrating the T-ds relation between the two states provides the general formula for entropy change:\n$$ \\Delta s = \\int_{T_{1}}^{T_{2}} \\frac{c_{p}(T)}{T} dT - R \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}}\\right) $$\nThe problem provides tabulated values for the temperature-dependent part of the specific entropy, $s^{0}(T) = \\int_{T_{\\text{ref}}}^{T} \\frac{c_{p}(T')}{T'} dT'$. This allows us to write the integral term as:\n$$ \\int_{T_{1}}^{T_{2}} \\frac{c_{p}(T)}{T} dT = s^{0}(T_{2}) - s^{0}(T_{1}) $$\nTherefore, the specific entropy change is given by:\n$$ \\Delta s = s^{0}(T_{2}) - s^{0}(T_{1}) - R \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}}\\right) $$\nTo apply this formula, we must determine the pressure ratio $p_{2}/p_{1}$. Since the air is a closed mass in a rigid tank, its volume is constant. Applying the ideal gas law, $pV = mRT$, to the initial and final states:\n$$ p_{1}V = mRT_{1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad p_{2}V = mRT_{2} $$\nDividing the second equation by the first yields the relationship between pressure and temperature for this constant-volume process:\n$$ \\frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}} = \\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}} $$\nSubstituting the given temperature values:\n$$ \\frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}} = \\frac{600\\,\\text{K}}{300\\,\\text{K}} = 2.00 $$\nNow, we can compute the change in specific entropy, $\\Delta s$, using the provided data:\n- $s^{0}(T_{1}) = s^{0}(300\\,\\text{K}) = 5.743~\\text{kJ/(kg·K)}$\n- $s^{0}(T_{2}) = s^{0}(600\\,\\text{K}) = 6.439~\\text{kJ/(kg·K)}$\n- $R = 0.287~\\text{kJ/(kg·K)}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $\\Delta s$:\n$$ \\Delta s = (6.439 - 5.743)\\,\\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kg·K}} - \\left(0.287\\,\\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kg·K}}\\right) \\ln(2.00) $$\n$$ \\Delta s = 0.696\\,\\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kg·K}} - 0.287 \\times 0.693147... \\,\\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kg·K}} $$\n$$ \\Delta s = 0.696\\,\\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kg·K}} - 0.198953... \\,\\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kg·K}} $$\n$$ \\Delta s = 0.497046... \\,\\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kg·K}} $$\nThe problem requires the total entropy change, $\\Delta S$, for the given mass of air, $m = 5.00~\\text{kg}$.

Let $K_c = x K_{\\text{tot}}$ and $K_h = (1-x) K_{\\text{tot}}$, where $x \\in (0,1)$. The term $\\frac{1}{K_c} + \\frac{1}{K_h}$ becomes $\\frac{1}{K_{\\text{tot}}} \\frac{1}{x(1-x)}$. To maximize $\\dot{Q}_c$ with respect to the allocation $x$, we can analyze the implicit governing equation $F(\\dot{Q}_c, x) = 0$. For an extremum, we require $\\frac{d\\dot{Q}_c}{dx} = 0$, which implies $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 0$, provided $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\dot{Q}_c} \\neq 0$.\nLet $A(x) = \\frac{1}{K_c} + \\frac{1}{K_h}$. The equation is $A(x) \\dot{Q}_c^2 + (T_h - T_c + \\dot{W}A(x))\\dot{Q}_c - \\dot{W}T_c = 0$.\nDifferentiating with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dx} \\dot{Q}_c^2 + \\dot{W}\\frac{dA}{dx}\\dot{Q}_c = 0 \\implies \\frac{dA}{dx} \\left( \\dot{Q}_c^2 + \\dot{W}\\dot{Q}_c \\right) = 0 $$\nSince $\\dot{Q}_c > 0$ and $\\dot{W} > 0$, the term $(\\dot{Q}_c^2 + \\dot{W}\\dot{Q}_c)$ must be non-zero. Thus, the condition for maximization reduces to $\\frac{dA}{dx} = 0$. This corresponds to minimizing the total thermal resistance term $A = \\frac{1}{K_c} + \\frac{1}{K_h}$ subject to $K_c+K_h=K_{\\text{tot}}$. This minimum occurs when the conductances are equally distributed.\n$$ K_c = K_h = \\frac{K_{\\text{tot}}}{2} $$\nThis is the necessary condition on the allocation that maximizes $\\dot{Q}_c$.\n\n**2) Optimal Cooling Rate, $\\dot{Q}_c^{\\star}$**\nWith the optimal allocation $K_c = K_h = K_{\\text{tot}}/2$, the term $\\frac{1}{K_c} + \\frac{1}{K_h}$ becomes $\\frac{2}{K_{\\text{tot}}/2} = \\frac{4}{K_{\\text{tot}}}$. Substituting this into the quadratic equation for $\\dot{Q}_c$:\n$$ \\frac{4}{K_{\\text{tot}}} (\\dot{Q}_c^{\\star})^2 + \\left( T_h - T_c + \\frac{4\\dot{W}}{K_{\\text{tot}}} \\right) \\dot{Q}_c^{\\star} - \\dot{W} T_c = 0 $$\nMultiplying by $K_{\\text{tot}}$ gives:\n$$ 4 (\\dot{Q}_c^{\\star})^2 + \\left( K_{\\text{tot}}(T_h - T_c) + 4\\dot{W} \\right) \\dot{Q}_c^{\\star} - \\dot{W} K_{\\text{tot}} T_c = 0 $$\nThis is a quadratic equation of the form $a z^2 + b z + c = 0$ for $z = \\dot{Q}_c^{\\star}$. The physical solution (with $\\dot{Q}_c^{\\star} > 0$) is given by the positive root:\n$$ \\dot{Q}_c^{\\star} = \\frac{-b + \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$\nwhere $a=4$, $b=K_{\\text{tot}}(T_h - T_c) + 4\\dot{W}$, and $c = -\\dot{W} K_{\\text{tot}} T_c$.\nThe closed-form solution for the optimal cooling rate is:\n$$ \\dot{Q}_c^{\\star} = \\frac{ - (K_{\\text{tot}}(T_h - T_c) + 4\\dot{W}) + \\sqrt{(K_{\\text{tot}}(T_h - T_c) + 4\\dot{W})^2 + 16 \\dot{W} K_{\\text{tot}} T_c} }{8} $$\n\n**3) Optimal Coefficient of Performance, $\\text{COP}^{\\star}$**\nThe coefficient of performance is defined as $\\text{COP} \\equiv \\dot{Q}_c/\\dot{W}$. For the optimal case:\n$$ \\text{COP}^{\\star} = \\frac{\\dot{Q}_c^{\\star}}{\\dot{W}} = \\frac{ - (K_{\\text{tot}}(T_h - T_c) + 4\\dot{W}) + \\sqrt{(K_{\\text{tot}}(T_h - T_c) + 4\\dot{W})^2 + 16 \\dot{W} K_{\\text{tot}} T_c} }{8\\dot{W}} $$\nAlternatively, we can derive a quadratic equation for $\\text{COP}^{\\star}$ by dividing the equation for $\\dot{Q}_c^{\\star}$ by $\\dot{W}^2$:\n$$ 4 \\left(\\frac{\\dot{Q}_c^{\\star}}{\\dot{W}}\\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{K_{\\text{tot}}(T_h - T_c)}{\\dot{W}} + 4 \\right) \\frac{\\dot{Q}_c^{\\star}}{\\dot{W}} - \\frac{K_{\\text{tot}} T_c}{\\dot{W}} = 0 $$\n$$ 4 (\\text{COP}^{\\star})^2 + \\left( 4 + \\frac{K_{\\text{tot}}(T_h - T_c)}{\\dot{W}} \\right) \\text{COP}^{\\star} - \\frac{K_{\\text{tot}} T_c}{\\dot{W}} = 0 $$\n\n**4) Numerical Evaluation**\nThe given parameters are:\n$T_c = 260~\\text{K}$, $T_h = 300~\\text{K}$, $\\dot{W} = 200~\\text{W}$, and $K_{\\text{tot}} = 20~\\text{W/K}$.\nFirst, calculate the coefficients for the quadratic equation for $\\text{COP}^{\\star}$:\n$$ T_h - T_c = 300~\\text{K} - 260~\\text{K} = 40~\\text{K} $$\n$$ \\frac{K_{\\text{tot}}(T_h - T_c)}{\\dot{W}} = \\frac{(20~\\text{W/K})(40~\\text{K})}{200~\\text{W}} = \\frac{800}{200} = 4 $$\n$$ \\frac{K_{\\text{tot}} T_c}{\\dot{W}} = \\frac{(20~\\text{W/K})(260~\\text{K})}{200~\\text{W}} = \\frac{5200}{200} = 26 $$\nThe equation becomes:\n$$ 4 (\\text{COP}^{\\star})^2 + (4 + 4) \\text{COP}^{\\star} - 26 = 0 $$\n$$ 4 (\\text{COP}^{\\star})^2 + 8 \\text{COP}^{\\star} - 26 = 0 $$\n$$ 2 (\\text{COP}^{\\star})^2 + 4 \\text{COP}^{\\star} - 13 = 0 $$\nSolving for $\\text{COP}^{\\star}$ using the quadratic formula (and taking the positive root):\n$$ \\text{COP}^{\\star} = \\frac{-4 + \\sqrt{4^2 - 4(2)(-13)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{-4 + \\sqrt{16 + 104}}{4} = \\frac{-4 + \\sqrt{120}}{4} = \\frac{-2 + \\sqrt{30}}{2} $$\n$$ \\text{COP}^{\\star} \\approx \\frac{-2 + 5.4772256}{2} \\approx 1.7386128 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\text{COP}^{\\star} = 1.739$.\n\nNext, we calculate the total steady entropy generation rate, $\\dot{S}_{\\text{gen}}^{\\star}$. This is the rate of entropy increase of the universe (the two reservoirs), as the working fluid operates in a cycle.\n$$ \\dot{S}_{\\text{gen}}^{\\star} = \\frac{\\dot{Q}_h^{\\star}}{T_h} - \\frac{\\dot{Q}_c^{\\star}}{T_c} $$\nFirst, find $\\dot{Q}_c^{\\star}$ and $\\dot{Q}_h^{\\star}$:\n$$ \\dot{Q}_c^{\\star} = \\text{COP}^{\\star} \\times \\dot{W} \\approx 1.7386128 \\times 200~\\text{W} \\approx 347.72256~\\text{W} $$\n$$ \\dot{Q}_h^{\\star} = \\dot{Q}_c^{\\star} + \\dot{W} \\approx 347.72256~\\text{W} + 200~\\text{W} \\approx 547.72256~\\text{W} $$\nNow compute the entropy generation rate:\n$$ \\dot{S}_{\\text{gen}}^{\\star} \\approx \\frac{547.72256~\\text{W}}{300~\\text{K}} - \\frac{347.72256~\\text{W}}{260~\\text{K}} \\approx 1.8257419~\\text{W/K} - 1.3373945~\\text{W/K} \\approx 0.4883474~\\text{W/K} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\dot{S}_{\\text{gen}}^{\\star} = 0.4883~\\text{W/K}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1.739  0.4883 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2521081"}]}
