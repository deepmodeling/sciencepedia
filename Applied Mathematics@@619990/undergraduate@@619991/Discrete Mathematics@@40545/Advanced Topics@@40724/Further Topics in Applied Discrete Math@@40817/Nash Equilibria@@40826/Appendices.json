The squares of the grid are identified by coordinate pairs $(r, c)$, where $r$ is the row number and $c$ is the column number, with $r, c \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\n\nThe game proceeds as follows: each player simultaneously chooses one of the four squares on the grid and places a marker on it. Let Alice's choice of square be $(r_A, c_A)$ and Bob's choice be $(r_B, c_B)$.\n\nThe payoff for each player is determined by the positions of both markers. A player's payoff is equal to the sum of the row and column numbers of the square they chose (i.e., $r+c$). However, a player receives this payoff only if the other player's marker is in a different row AND a different column. If the two markers are in the same row or in the same column (or both), the player's payoff for that round is 0.\n\nFor example, if Alice chooses $(1,1)$ and Bob chooses $(2,2)$, their markers are in different rows and different columns. Alice's payoff is $1+1=2$, and Bob's payoff is $2+2=4$. If Alice chooses $(1,1)$ and Bob chooses $(1,2)$, their markers are in the same row, so both players receive a payoff of 0.\n\nIdentify all pure-strategy Nash equilibria for this game from the options below.
