This is too strong: an independent set may intersect a circuit without containing it. For example, in a graphic matroid, a forest edge set can share edges with a cycle without forming a cycle.\n\n- Option D requires $|S| < |C|$ for all circuits $C$. This is neither necessary nor sufficient in general matroids. For instance, in a graphic matroid with a triangle circuit of size $3$, one can have an independent set $S$ of size $3$ not forming a cycle, so $|S|=|C|$ for some circuit $C$, contradicting the criterion.\n\n- Option E declares $S$ dependent only if $S$ equals a circuit.
