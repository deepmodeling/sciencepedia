In this scenario, your goal is to find the optimal mix of actions to protect a server against a rational hacker [@problem_id:1384634]. This exercise is fundamental because it demonstrates the core principle of mixed strategy equilibrium: you choose your probabilities not to directly maximize your payoff, but to make your opponent indifferent to their choices, thereby neutralizing their ability to exploit your strategy.", "problem": "A network administrator, Alex, is responsible for securing a critical server. Alex is in a strategic conflict with a persistent hacker known as 'The Ghost'. Both must choose their actions without knowing the other's choice. This situation can be modeled as a zero-sum game.\n\nAlex has two possible actions:\n1.  **Patch**: Spend time applying the latest security patches to known vulnerabilities.\n2.  **Monitor**: Actively monitor the network traffic for suspicious activity.\n\nThe Ghost also has two actions:\n1.  **Known Exploit**: Attempt to breach the server using a well-documented vulnerability.\n2.  **Zero-Day Attack**: Use a novel, previously unknown vulnerability.\n\nThe outcomes of their confrontation are quantified by a utility score for Alex. Since it is a zero-sum game, The Ghost's utility is the negative of Alex's. The scores for Alex are as follows:\n-   If Alex chooses 'Patch' and The Ghost chooses 'Known Exploit', the utility for Alex is +10.\n-   If Alex chooses 'Patch' and The Ghost chooses 'Zero-Day Attack', the utility for Alex is -5.\n-   If Alex chooses 'Monitor' and The Ghost chooses 'Known Exploit', the utility for Alex is -2.\n-   If Alex chooses 'Monitor' and The Ghost chooses 'Zero-Day Attack', the utility for Alex is +8.\n\nAssuming both Alex and The Ghost are perfectly rational and play to optimize their own respective outcomes, what is the probability that Alex should choose the 'Patch' action? Express your answer as an irreducible fraction.", "solution": "This is a two-player zero-sum game. Let's denote the players as Alex (the administrator) and The Ghost (the hacker). We need to find the optimal mixed strategy for Alex. A mixed strategy is a probability distribution over the player's available actions.\n\nFirst, we can represent Alex's utility scores in a payoff matrix. The rows represent Alex's choices, and the columns represent The Ghost's choices. The entries are Alex's utility.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n & \\text{Known Exploit} & \\text{Zero-Day Attack} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Patch} & 10 & -5 \\\\\n\\text{Monitor} & -2 & 8\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nLet $p$ be the probability that Alex chooses 'Patch'. Consequently, the probability that Alex chooses 'Monitor' is $1-p$.\nLet $q$ be the probability that The Ghost chooses 'Known Exploit'. Consequently, the probability that The Ghost chooses 'Zero-Day Attack' is $1-q$.\n\nSince the game is zero-sum, The Ghost's utility matrix is the negative of Alex's:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n & \\text{Known Exploit} & \\text{Zero-Day Attack} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Patch} & -10 & 5 \\\\\n\\text{Monitor} & 2 & -8\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nIn a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, each player chooses their probabilities to make the other player indifferent between their pure strategies. Alex's goal is to choose a probability $p$ that will make The Ghost's expected utility the same regardless of whether The Ghost chooses 'Known Exploit' or 'Zero-Day Attack'.\n\nLet's calculate The Ghost's expected utility for each of their pure strategies, as a function of Alex's strategy $p$.\n\nThe Ghost's expected utility for choosing 'Known Exploit', $E_G(\\text{KE})$, is:\n$$E_G(\\text{KE}) = p \\cdot (-10) + (1-p) \\cdot (2) = -10p + 2 - 2p = 2 - 12p$$\n\nThe Ghost's expected utility for choosing 'Zero-Day Attack', $E_G(\\text{ZD})$, is:\n$$E_G(\\text{ZD}) = p \\cdot (5) + (1-p) \\cdot (-8) = 5p - 8 + 8p = 13p - 8$$\n\nFor The Ghost to be indifferent, these two expected utilities must be equal:\n$$E_G(\\text{KE}) = E_G(\\text{ZD})$$\n$$2 - 12p = 13p - 8$$\n\nNow, we solve for $p$:\n$$2 + 8 = 13p + 12p$$\n$$10 = 25p$$\n$$p = \\frac{10}{25}$$\n\nSimplifying the fraction gives:\n$$p = \\frac{2}{5}$$\n\nThus, to maximize their expected utility against a rational opponent, Alex should choose the 'Patch' action with a probability of $\\frac{2}{5}$. With this strategy, The Ghost's expected utility is the same for either of their actions, so they have no incentive to deviate. This is Alex's optimal mixed strategy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$$", "id": "1384634"}, {"introduction": "Not every strategic encounter is a simple two-by-two matrix.

Both players simultaneously and secretly choose an integer from the set $\\{2, 3, 4\\}$. Let Rowena's choice be $i$ and Colin's choice be $j$.\n\nThe game is zero-sum. The scoring is determined by the coprimality of the two chosen numbers. Two integers are coprime if their greatest common divisor is 1. If $i$ and $j$ are coprime, Rowena wins 1 point from Colin. If $i$ and $j$ are not coprime, Colin wins 1 point from Rowena.\n\nBoth players are perfectly rational and aim to maximize their own expected score by employing optimal strategies.

Similarly, Colin’s indifference requires that Rowena’s mix makes Colin’s pure columns yield the same payoff to Rowena. Against Colin choosing Even, Rowena’s expected payoff is\n$$\nv_{E}(p)=p\\cdot(-1)+(1-p)\\cdot 1=1-2p,\n$$\nand against Colin choosing $3$ it is\n$$\nv_{3}(p)=p\\cdot 1+(1-p)\\cdot(-1)=2p-1.\n$$\nIndifference gives $1-2p=2p-1$, hence $p=\\frac{1}{2}$.
