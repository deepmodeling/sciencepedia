Bug A primarily corrupts data in the Project Organizer, while Bug B causes crashes in the Data Visualizer. The engineering team has limited resources and can only focus on fixing one of the two bugs in the next patch cycle.\n\nSimultaneously, a power user, representing the strategic choices of the user base, must decide which of the two features to rely on for an upcoming critical project. The user's decision will be made without knowing which bug the company will prioritize.\n\nThis strategic interaction between the user and the company can be modeled as a two-person, zero-sum game. The user is the row player, whose goal is to maximize their productivity, which is quantified by a \"satisfaction score.\" The company is the column player, who, playing conservatively, aims to minimize the maximum satisfaction score the user can achieve.\n\nThe satisfaction scores for the user, based on the combination of their choice (row) and the company's choice (column), are given in the following payoff matrix:\n\n| | Company: Fix Bug A | Company: Fix Bug B |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| **User: Use Project Organizer** | 8 | 2 |\n| **User: Use Data Visualizer** | 6 | 5 |\n\nAssuming both the company and the user play optimally according to the minimax theorem to reach a stable equilibrium in pure strategies, determine the value of the game.
