This first exercise challenges you to model a seemingly complex tiling problem by breaking it down into a few simple choices at the beginning of the process. By analyzing how the first few tiles can be placed, you will derive a recurrence that counts all possible arrangements, a technique applicable in fields like crystallography and layout design [@problem_id:1395086].", "problem": "A contractor is tasked with tiling a rectangular hallway that measures $2$ units in width and $n$ units in length. The contractor has an unlimited supply of two types of tiles:\n1.  Rectangular tiles with dimensions $1 \\times 2$ units (dominoes).\n2.  Square tiles with dimensions $2 \\times 2$ units.\n\nThe tiles can be placed in any orientation, but they must lie flat, cover the entire hallway without overlapping, and be fully contained within the hallway's boundaries.\n\nLet $a_n$ represent the total number of distinct ways to tile a $2 \\times n$ hallway. For example, $a_1 = 1$, as a $2 \\times 1$ hallway can only be tiled with a single domino placed vertically. A $2 \\times 2$ hallway can be tiled in 3 ways: with two vertical dominoes, with two horizontal dominoes, or with a single square tile. Thus, $a_2 = 3$.\n\nFind the numerical value of $a_8$.", "solution": "Let $a_{n}$ denote the number of tilings of a $2 \\times n$ hallway using $1 \\times 2$ dominoes and $2 \\times 2$ squares.

There are exactly two ways to fill this $2 \\times 2$ block: either by one $2 \\times 2$ square or by two horizontal $1 \\times 2$ dominoes. In either case, the remaining region is $2 \\times (n-2)$, contributing $a_{n-2}$ tilings per option, for a total of $2 a_{n-2}$.\n\nTherefore, the recurrence is\n$$\na_{n} = a_{n-1} + 2 a_{n-2}.\n$$\nThe base cases are $a_{0} = 1$ (empty tiling) and $a_{1} = 1$ (only one vertical domino fits).

In this problem, we move from tiling floors to scheduling tasks, where the constraint is logical rather than physical.

Due to the nature of the jobs and shared resource constraints, the system is configured to prevent jobs from being scheduled in two consecutive time slots. A \"valid schedule\" is defined as any set of time slots selected for maintenance that adheres to this rule. This includes the possibility of performing no jobs at all (i.e., selecting the empty set of time slots).\n\nLet $S_n$ be the number of distinct valid schedules possible for $n$ time slots.
