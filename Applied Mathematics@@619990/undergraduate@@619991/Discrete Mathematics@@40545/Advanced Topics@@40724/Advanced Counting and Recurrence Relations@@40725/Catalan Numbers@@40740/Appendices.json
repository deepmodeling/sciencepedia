A staircase polyomino of size $n$ is a two-dimensional shape made of unit squares arranged on a grid. It consists of $n$ columns of squares, indexed $i=1, 2, \\dots, n$ from left to right. For each $i$, the $i$-th column has a height of $i$ unit squares.\n\nTo optimize manufacturing, this entire staircase region must be perfectly partitioned, with no overlap and no gaps, into exactly $n$ rectangular blocks. The sides of these rectangular blocks must be aligned with the grid axes.\n\nDetermine the total number of distinct ways to perform such a partition for a staircase polyomino of size $n=10$.", "solution": "Let $T(n)$ be the number of ways to partition the staircase polyomino of size $n$. We set $T(0)=1$ for the empty case. In any valid partition, consider the rectangle $R$ that covers the bottom-right corner cell, $(n,1)$. This rectangle must have height 1 and some width $k$, where $1 \\le k \\le n$. Removing this rectangle $R$ decomposes the problem into tiling two independent, smaller regions: a staircase polyomino of size $n-k$ to the left of $R$, and a shape above $R$ that is equivalent to a staircase polyomino of size $k-1$. Summing the product of possibilities, $T(n-k)T(k-1)$, over all possible widths $k$ yields the recurrence relation:\n$$\nT(n) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} T(n-k)T(k-1)\n$$\nRe-indexing ($j=k-1$) gives the familiar form $T(n) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} T(j)T(n-1-j)$.

The scenario described here rephrases the famous \"Dyck path\" problem, which involves paths that are not allowed to dip below a certain boundary.

The system enters a vulnerable state if and only if there exists some $k$ for which $X_{k} < 0$, which is equivalent to the path touching the line $y=-1$.\n\nTo count sequences that become vulnerable, we use the reflection principle. For any path that touches the line $y=-1$, there is a first time $t$ where $X_t=-1$. If we reflect the initial portion of the path (from $k=0$ to $k=t$) across the line $y=-1$, we create a new path. This new path starts at $(0,0)$ and ends at $(2n,-2)$, because the reflection effectively swaps up-steps and down-steps in the initial segment, resulting in one net additional down-step. The total number of steps remains $2n$, but the final composition becomes $n-1$ up-steps and $n+1$ down-steps.\n\nThis construction creates a bijection between the set of \"vulnerable\" paths from $(0,0)$ to $(2n,0)$ and the set of all paths from $(0,0)$ to $(2n,-2)$.
