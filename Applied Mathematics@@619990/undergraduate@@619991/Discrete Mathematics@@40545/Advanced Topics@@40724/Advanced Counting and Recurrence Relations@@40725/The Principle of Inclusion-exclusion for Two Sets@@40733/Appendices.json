By calculating the total number of university courses from two overlapping categories, you will practice the fundamental formula $|A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B|$.

To encourage breadth of study, courses can have multiple designations. In the list of all approved CSS courses, there are a total of 157 courses designated as 'Quantitative Methods'. Separately, there are 94 courses designated as 'Ethics in Technology'. A review of the course catalog shows that there is an overlap: exactly 36 courses are designated as both 'Quantitative Methods' and 'Ethics in Technology'.\n\nCalculate the total number of distinct courses that are designated as either 'Quantitative Methods' or 'Ethics in Technology'.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total number of distinct courses that fall into at least one of two specified categories. This is a classic application of the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion for two sets.\n\nLet's define two sets to represent the categories of courses:\nLet $Q$ be the set of courses designated as 'Quantitative Methods'.\nLet $E$ be the set of courses designated as 'Ethics in Technology'.\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n1.  The number of courses designated as 'Quantitative Methods' is 157. In set notation, this is the size (or cardinality) of set $Q$:\n    $$|Q| = 157$$\n2.  The number of courses designated as 'Ethics in Technology' is 94. This is the cardinality of set $E$:\n    $$|E| = 94$$\n3.  The number of courses designated as both 'Quantitative Methods' and 'Ethics in Technology' is 36. This corresponds to the number of elements in the intersection of the two sets, $Q \\cap E$:\n    $$|Q \\cap E| = 36$$\n\nWe want to find the total number of distinct courses that are in either set $Q$ or set $E$. This is equivalent to finding the cardinality of the union of the two sets, denoted as $|Q \\cup E|$.\n\nThe Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion for two sets states that the size of the union of the sets is the sum of their individual sizes minus the size of their intersection:\n$$|Q \\cup E| = |Q| + |E| - |Q \\cap E|$$\n\nThe reason we subtract the intersection is that the courses in both categories are counted once when we count the elements of $Q$ and again when we count the elements of $E$. To get the correct total number of unique courses, we must subtract this overcounted group once.\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into the formula:\n$$|Q \\cup E| = 157 + 94 - 36$$\n\nFirst, perform the addition:\n$$157 + 94 = 251$$\n\nNext, perform the subtraction:\n$$251 - 36 = 215$$\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct courses that are either 'Quantitative Methods' or 'Ethics in Technology' is 215.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{215}$$", "id": "1410019"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond directly given counts, this problem challenges you to apply the principle to a structured environmentâ€”a grid of microcapsules.
