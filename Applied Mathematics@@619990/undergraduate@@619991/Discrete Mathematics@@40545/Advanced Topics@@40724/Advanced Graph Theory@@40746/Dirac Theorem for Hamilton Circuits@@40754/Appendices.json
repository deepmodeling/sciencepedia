The vertices of $C_{10}$ are labeled $v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_9$ in sequential order around the cycle. In a cycle graph $C_n$, the distance between two vertices $v_i$ and $v_j$ is defined as $\\min(|i-j|, n-|i-j|)$.

In $C_{10}$, only vertices at distance $1$ are adjacent, so $v_{a}$ and $v_{b}$ are not already adjacent; adding this edge does not create loops or multiple edges, hence $G$ is simple.\n\nAdding this single edge increases the degrees of exactly the two endpoints:\n$$\n\\deg_{G}(v_{a})=\\deg_{C_{10}}(v_{a})+1=3,\\quad \\deg_{G}(v_{b})=3,\n$$\nand for all other vertices $v$, $\\deg_{G}(v)=2$.

Instead of checking if a given graph is Hamiltonian, you will determine the minimum number of edges a graph must have to guarantee the condition is met. This exercise beautifully illustrates the connection between a local property (the degree of each vertex) and a global property (the total number of edges), a fundamental concept in graph theory [@problem_id:1363871].", "problem": "A technology company is designing a new communication network to connect its 10 primary data centers. The network is modeled as a simple graph, where the data centers are the vertices and the direct, high-bandwidth communication links are the edges. For reliability and maintenance purposes, the network architecture must guarantee the existence of a Hamilton circuit, which is a closed path that visits every data center exactly once before returning to the starting data center.\n\nThe network design team uses a well-established result from graph theory known as Dirac's theorem to ensure this property. The theorem states: a simple graph with $n$ vertices, where $n \\geq 3$, is guaranteed to have a Hamilton circuit if the degree of every vertex is at least $n/2$.\n\nBased on this theorem, what is the absolute minimum number of communication links the company must install to guarantee that their network of 10 data centers has a Hamilton circuit?", "solution": "Let the network be modeled by a simple graph $G$ with $n=10$ vertices.

Moreover, any $m25$ would yield an average degree $2m/105$, implying some vertex has degree less than $5$, which fails Dirac's condition and thus cannot guarantee a Hamilton circuit by this theorem.\n\nHence, based on Dirac's theorem, the absolute minimum number of communication links required is $25$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{25}$$", "id": "1363871"}, {"introduction": "This final practice places you in the role of a network architect tasked with upgrading an existing system.

This ensures each Engineering member is incident to at least one new edge, raising all their degrees to at least $6$, while Strategy members remain at degree $7 \\geq 6$.
