This cornerstone of graph theory is not just an abstract curiosity; it is a practical tool for designers and engineers. This first exercise [@problem_id:1527481] places you in the role of a robotics engineer, using Euler's formula to determine a crucial parameter in a circuit board design and demonstrating its direct application in real-world scenarios.", "problem": "A team of robotics engineers is designing the circuitry for a new processing unit. The layout of components and their connections on the circuit board can be modeled as a connected planar graph. In this model, each primary component is a vertex, and each conductive trace between two components is an edge. The design is planar, meaning no two traces cross each other. The proposed design features 12 primary components. When laid out on the plane, the network of traces divides the board's surface into 8 distinct regions, including the unbounded region surrounding the entire circuit. Based on this information, calculate the total number of conductive traces in the design.", "solution": "Let $V$ be the number of vertices, $E$ the number of edges, and $F$ the number of faces (including the unbounded face) of a connected planar graph. By Euler's formula for connected planar graphs,\n$$\nV - E + F = 2.\n$$\nSolving for $E$ gives\n$$\nE = V + F - 2.\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $V = 12$ and $F = 8$,\n$$\nE = 12 + 8 - 2 = 18.\n$$\nTherefore, the total number of conductive traces (edges) is $18$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{18}$$", "id": "1527481"}, {"introduction": "Beyond describing existing planar graphs, Euler's formula provides powerful tools to prove when a graph is *non-planar*. By establishing an upper limit on the number of edges a simple planar graph can have relative to its vertices, we can quickly disqualify designs that are too \"dense\" to be drawn without crossings. In this problem [@problem_id:1391516], you will apply a critical inequality derived from this formula to an ambitious urban planning project, learning a vital skill for assessing the feasibility of network layouts.", "problem": "An urban planning firm is designing a futuristic \"sky-city\" district. The design features $V = 12$ skyscrapers that are to be connected by a network of $E = 32$ direct, non-intersecting sky-bridges. The resulting network of skyscrapers (nodes) and sky-bridges (links) is intended to be connected, meaning it's possible to travel from any skyscraper to any other.\n\nA fundamental theorem in network topology, which is used to assess the feasibility of such two-dimensional layouts, states that for any simple, connected planar graph with $v$ vertices and $e$ edges, the inequality $e \\leq 3v - 6$ must hold, provided that $v \\geq 3$. A simple graph is one with no loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) and no more than one edge between any pair of vertices. The sky-city design adheres to the simple graph model.\n\nThe proposed design with 32 sky-bridges is found to be non-compliant with this topological constraint, making it impossible to build on a flat plane without bridges crossing. What is the minimum number of sky-bridges that must be removed from the plan for it to satisfy this necessary condition for a planar layout?", "solution": "We use the necessary condition for a simple, connected planar graph with $v \\geq 3$:\n$$\ne \\leq 3v - 6.\n$$\nFor the given design, $v = 12$ and $e = 32$.

This \"dual graph\" provides a different perspective on the original's structure, with its vertices representing the original's faces and its edges representing adjacencies between those faces. This practice [@problem_id:1527524] invites you to explore this elegant concept by constructing the dual of a common graph, a task that deepens the understanding of the geometric nature of planar embeddings.", "problem": "In graph theory, a planar embedding of a graph is a drawing of the graph on a plane such that no two edges cross each other. Such a drawing divides the plane into connected regions called faces. One of these faces is an unbounded region, called the outer face. For any planar embedding of a graph $G$, we can construct its dual graph, denoted $G^*$. The dual graph $G^*$ contains one vertex for each face of $G$. An edge connects two vertices in $G^*$ if and only if their corresponding faces in $G$ are adjacent, meaning they share a common edge on their boundary.\n\nConsider the wheel graph $W_6$. This graph is constructed from a cycle graph with five vertices, which we can label $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5$ in sequence around the cycle. An additional central \"hub\" vertex, $v_0$, is connected by an edge to each of the five vertices on the cycle.\n\nImagine a planar embedding of this graph $W_6$ where the hub vertex $v_0$ is placed at the center, and the cycle of vertices $v_1, \\dots, v_5$ forms a pentagon around it.\n\nBased on this specific planar embedding, determine the structure of the dual graph $G^*$.

The edges are the 5 rim edges $v_i v_{i+1}$ (indices modulo 5) and the 5 spokes $v_0 v_i$, so the total number of edges is $E=10$. The number of vertices is $V=6$. By Eulerâ€™s formula,\n$$\nV-E+F=2 \\implies 6-10+F=2 \\implies F=6.\n$$\nThus there are $6$ faces: $5$ inner triangular faces and $1$ outer face.\n\nIn the dual graph $G^*$, there is one vertex for each face, so $G^*$ has $6$ vertices: one corresponding to the outer face, and five corresponding to the inner triangular faces $T_i$ bounded by the edges $v_0 v_i$, $v_i v_{i+1}$, and $v_0 v_{i+1}$.\n\nAdjacency in $G^*$ is determined by shared edges in $G$:\n- Each rim edge $v_i v_{i+1}$ lies between the outer face and the triangle $T_i$, so the vertex for the outer face is adjacent to each of the five $T_i$ vertices.\n- Each spoke $v_0 v_i$ lies between the two adjacent triangles $T_{i-1}$ and $T_i$, so the vertices corresponding to $T_{i-1}$ and $T_i$ are adjacent. Consequently, the five $T_i$ vertices form a 5-cycle.\n\nTherefore, $G^*$ consists of a 5-cycle with an additional vertex adjacent to all five cycle vertices, which is exactly the wheel graph on $6$ vertices. Hence $G^* \\cong W_6$, matching option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1527524"}]}
