This practice models a system with two components, creating a poset that can be visualized as a simple grid, making the relationships of comparability and incomparability easy to see. By directly constructing a maximum antichain and a minimum chain partition, you will verify the core statement of Dilworth's Theorem in a clear and concrete setting.", "id": "1363688", "problem": "Consider a system composed of two independent components, Component 1 and Component 2. The operational state of each component can be set to one of three levels: Low (L), Medium (M), or High (H). A complete configuration of the system is described by an ordered pair $(s_1, s_2)$, where $s_1$ is the state of Component 1 and $s_2$ is the state of Component 2.\n\nThe set of all possible configurations forms a partially ordered set. This order is defined based on the natural progression of the states, where we define L < M < H. A configuration $C_a = (s_{a1}, s_{a2})$ is considered 'less than or equal to' another configuration $C_b = (s_{b1}, s_{b2})$, denoted $C_a \\preceq C_b$, if and only if $s_{a1} \\le s_{b1}$ and $s_{a2} \\le s_{b2}$ according to the state ordering.\n\nWithin this partially ordered set:\n- A **chain** is a subset of configurations in which for any two configurations in the subset, one is less than or equal to the other.\n- An **antichain** is a subset of configurations in which no two distinct configurations are comparable (i.e., for any two distinct configurations $C_x$ and $C_y$ in the subset, neither $C_x \\preceq C_y$ nor $C_y \\preceq C_x$ is true).\n\nYour task is to determine two values for this partially ordered set of system configurations:\n1. The size of a maximum antichain (an antichain with the largest possible number of elements).\n2. The size of a minimum chain partition (a partition of the entire set of configurations into the smallest possible number of disjoint chains).\n\n", "solution": "We formalize the states by mapping $L \\mapsto 0$, $M \\mapsto 1$, and $H \\mapsto 2$. Then the poset of configurations is $P=\\{0,1,2\\}\\times\\{0,1,2\\}$ with the product order: $(i,j)\\preceq (i',j')$ if and only if $i\\leq i'$ and $j\\leq j'$.\n\nTo bound the size of an antichain from above, let $A\\subseteq P$ be an antichain. The first coordinate takes only $3$ possible values, so if $|A|\\geq 4$, by the pigeonhole principle there exist two distinct elements of $A$ with the same first coordinate, say $(i,j_{1})$ and $(i,j_{2})$. Since $\\{j_{1},j_{2}\\}\\subseteq\\{0,1,2\\}$ and $j_{1}\\neq j_{2}$, either $j_{1}<j_{2}$ or $j_{2}<j_{1}$, which makes the two elements comparable, contradicting that $A$ is an antichain. Hence any antichain has size at most $3$.\n\nTo show this bound is tight, consider the set $\\{(0,2),(1,1),(2,0)\\}$. For any two distinct elements in this set, one has a smaller first coordinate and a larger second coordinate than the other, so no two are comparable. Therefore there exists an antichain of size $3$, and the maximum antichain size is exactly $3$.\n\nFor chain partitions, in any partition of $P$ into chains, each chain contains at most one element of any antichain. Therefore the number of chains in any chain partition is at least the size of a maximum antichain, which is $3$.\n\nTo prove that $3$ chains suffice, construct an explicit partition into $3$ chains:\n- $C_{1}: (0,0)\\preceq(0,1)\\preceq(0,2)$,\n- $C_{2}: (1,0)\\preceq(1,1)\\preceq(1,2)$,\n- $C_{3}: (2,0)\\preceq(2,1)\\preceq(2,2)$.\nThese chains are disjoint and cover all $9$ elements of $P$, so there exists a chain partition with exactly $3$ chains. Combining the lower and upper bounds, the minimum chain partition size is $3$.\n\nThus, the size of a maximum antichain is $3$, and the size of a minimum chain partition is $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}3 & 3\\end{pmatrix}}$$"}, {"introduction": "Having explored a basic grid-like poset, we now turn to a classic and richer example that connects poset theory with number theory. The set of divisors of an integer, ordered by divisibility, forms a natural poset whose structure is determined by the integer's prime factorization [@problem_id:1363660]. This exercise challenges you to find the minimum number of chains needed to partition the divisors of 360, which requires you to determine the poset's width.

Thus $(D,|)$ is isomorphic to the product of chains $C_{4}\\times C_{3}\\times C_{2}$.\n\nBy Dilworth’s theorem, the minimum number of chains in a partition of a finite poset equals its width (the size of a largest antichain). Therefore, it suffices to compute the maximum size of an antichain in $(D,|)$.\n\nDefine a rank function $r(i,j,k)=i+j+k$. For any fixed $t$, the level $L_{t}=\\{(i,j,k):i+j+k=t\\}$ is an antichain: if $(i,j,k)\\leq (i',j',k')$ and $i+j+k=i'+j'+k'$, then coordinate-wise inequalities with equal sums force $(i,j,k)=(i',j',k')$. The size of $L_{t}$ equals the coefficient of $x^{t}$ in the generating function\n$$\n(1+x+x^{2}+x^{3})(1+x+x^{2})(1+x).\n$$\nWe compute this product step by step. First,\n$$\n(1+x+x^{2})(1+x)=1+2x+2x^{2}+x^{3}.\n$$\nThen\n\\begin{align*}\n(1+x+x^{2}+x^{3})(1+2x+2x^{2}+x^{3})\n&=1(1+2x+2x^{2}+x^{3})\\\\\n&\\quad +x(1+2x+2x^{2}+x^{3})\\\\\n&\\quad +x^{2}(1+2x+2x^{2}+x^{3})\\\\\n&\\quad +x^{3}(1+2x+2x^{2}+x^{3})\\\\\n&=1+3x+5x^{2}+6x^{3}+5x^{4}+3x^{5}+x^{6}.\n\\end{align*}\nThus the level sizes are $1,3,5,6,5,3,1$, and the largest is $6$.
