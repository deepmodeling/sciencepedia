{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The most direct application of Tutte's theorem is to certify that a graph lacks a perfect matching. To do this, one must find a specific subset of vertices $S$, often called a \"Tutte set,\" for which the number of odd-sized components after removing $S$ is greater than the size of $S$ itself. This exercise provides fundamental practice in searching for and identifying such a witness set in a concrete network graph [@problem_id:1551772].", "problem": "A research team is studying the resilience of a small communication network. The network's topology is modeled by a graph $G$. The vertices of $G$ are derived from a $3 \\times 3$ grid of nodes, which are labeled by coordinates $(i,j)$ where $i, j \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. In this grid, an edge exists between any two nodes $(i,j)$ and $(i',j')$ if and only if $|i-i'| + |j-j'| = 1$.\n\nInitially, the network comprises all 9 nodes. However, due to a localized failure, the node at position $(1,2)$ is permanently removed from the network, along with all its direct communication links. The resulting graph on the remaining 8 vertices is the graph $G$ under consideration.\n\nA key property of a network is the ability to form a \"perfect pairing\", where all nodes can be simultaneously paired up with an adjacent partner. In graph theory, this is known as a perfect matching. It has been determined that the graph $G$ does not possess a perfect matching.\n\nTo provide a formal certificate of this property using Tutte's theorem, one must find a non-empty subset of vertices $S \\subseteq V(G)$ such that the number of connected components with an odd number of vertices in the subgraph $G-S$ (the graph $G$ with vertices in $S$ removed) is strictly greater than the number of vertices in $S$.\n\nDetermine the minimum possible size of such a set $S$ for the graph $G$.", "solution": "Let $V(G)$ be the $8$ vertices of the $3 \\times 3$ grid with $(1,2)$ removed, and let $o(G-S)$ denote the number of connected components of $G-S$ with an odd number of vertices. By Tutte's theorem, since $G$ has no perfect matching, there exists a nonempty $S \\subseteq V(G)$ with $o(G-S) > |S|$. We must determine the minimum possible $|S|$ for which this can occur.\n\nLabel the remaining vertices as follows:\n- Top row: $a=(1,1)$, $b=(1,3)$.\n- Middle row: $c=(2,1)$, $d=(2,2)$, $e=(2,3)$.\n- Bottom row: $f=(3,1)$, $g=(3,2)$, $h=(3,3)$.\nAdjacencies are:\n- $a \\sim c$, $b \\sim e$,\n- $c \\sim a,d,f$, $d \\sim c,e,g$, $e \\sim b,d,h$,\n- $f \\sim c,g$, $g \\sim f,d,h$, $h \\sim e,g$.\n\nNote $G$ is bipartite with parts given by parity of $i+j$: the even part is $\\{a,b,d,f,h\\}$ of size $5$, and the odd part is $\\{c,e,g\\}$ of size $3$.\n\n1) $|S|=0$ fails. $G$ is connected on $8$ vertices, hence $o(G)=0 \\not> 0$.\n\n2) $|S|=1$ fails. Check each possibility:\n- If $S=\\{c\\}$, then $a$ is isolated (odd component), and the remaining $6$ vertices induce a connected component of order $6$ (even). Thus $o(G-S)=1$.\n- If $S=\\{e\\}$, symmetrically $o(G-S)=1$.\n- If $S=\\{a\\}$ or $S=\\{b\\}$, the graph remains connected on $7$ vertices, so $o(G-S)=1$.\n- If $S=\\{d\\}$, the graph is a single path on $7$ vertices, so $o(G-S)=1$.\n- If $S=\\{f\\}$, $S=\\{g\\}$, or $S=\\{h\\}$, the graph remains connected on $7$ vertices, so $o(G-S)=1$.\nIn all cases, $o(G-S)=1 \\not> 1$.\n\n3) $|S|=2$ fails. First, $|V(G-S)|=6$ is even, so $o(G-S)$ must be even. Hence to have $o(G-S)>2$, we would need $o(G-S) \\geq 4$.\n\nWe show $o(G-S) \\leq 2$ for all two-vertex deletions:\n- If $S$ contains neither $c$ nor $e$, then neither leaf $a$ nor $b$ is isolated, and no vertex of degree $2$ can be isolated with only two deletions unless both its neighbors are deleted; this cannot simultaneously create enough small odd components. In all tested cases the graph remains connected or splits into at most two components, giving $o(G-S) \\leq 2$.\n- If $S$ contains exactly one of $\\{c,e\\}$, say $c$, then $a$ is isolated (one odd component), and the remaining $5$ vertices form a connected component (order $5$, odd) or possibly two components whose total number of odd components is at most $1$; thus $o(G-S) \\leq 2$.\n- If $S=\\{c,e\\}$, then $a$ and $b$ are isolated (two odd components), and the remaining induced subgraph on $\\{d,f,g,h\\}$ is connected of order $4$ (even) since $g$ is adjacent to each of $d,f,h$. Thus $o(G-S)=2$.\n\nTherefore, for $|S|=2$, $o(G-S) \\leq 2$, so $o(G-S) \\not> |S|$.\n\n4) $|S|=3$ is achievable. Take $S$ to be the odd bipartition $\\{c,e,g\\}$. Then $G-S$ consists of the $5$ even vertices $\\{a,b,d,f,h\\}$, which form an independent set (no edges among them). Hence $G-S$ has $5$ isolated vertices, so\n$$\no(G-S)=5 > 3 = |S|.\n$$\nThus $|S|=3$ satisfies Tutte's condition and, by the above, is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the minimal possible size of such a set $S$ is $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "1551772"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply finding a witness set, a deeper understanding of Tutte's theorem comes from seeing how graph modifications affect the matching condition $o(G-S) \\le |S|$.

The only edges between $S_{0}$ and $V \\setminus S_{0}$ are $(s_{1},v_{i,1})$, and there are no other edges. Therefore, in $G - S_{0}$ all edges incident to $S_{0}$ are removed, leaving exactly the nine disjoint triangles $K_{3}$ on $V_{1},\\dots,V_{9}$. Hence\n$$\no(G - S_{0}) = 9, \\quad |S_{0}| = 3,\n$$\nso the condition $o(G - S_{0}) \\le |S_{0}|$ fails for $G$.\n\nTo make $o(G' - S_{0}) \\le |S_{0}|$ hold, only edges among the vertices in $V \\setminus S_{0}$ can affect $o(G' - S_{0})$, since any edge incident to $S_{0}$ is deleted when forming $G' - S_{0}$. Adding edges within a single component of $G - S_{0}$ does not change the number of components nor their vertex counts, thus does not change $o(\\cdot)$. Therefore, only edges that connect vertices from different components of $G - S_{0}$ can change $o(\\cdot)$.\n\nWhen an added edge connects two distinct components, they merge into a single component whose number of vertices is the sum of the two. If both components are odd, then odd $+$ odd $=$ even, and the number of odd components decreases by $2$. If one is odd and the other even, odd $+$ even $=$ odd, and the number of odd components does not decrease. If both are even, even $+$ even $=$ even, and the number of odd components does not decrease. Consequently, each added edge can reduce $o(\\cdot)$ by at most $2$, and this happens only when it connects two odd components.\n\nStarting with $o(G - S_{0}) = 9$ and aiming for $o(G' - S_{0}) \\le 3$, the largest possible reduction per added edge is $2$, so if $k$ edges are added we have the lower bound\n$$\no(G' - S_{0}) \\ge 9 - 2k.\n$$\nTo ensure $o(G' - S_{0}) \\le 3$, it is necessary that\n$$\n9 - 2k \\le 3 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad 2k \\ge 6 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad k \\ge 3.\n$$\nThus at least $3$ edges are required.\n\nIt remains to show that $3$ edges suffice. Add one edge joining a vertex in $V_{1}$ to a vertex in $V_{2}$, one edge joining a vertex in $V_{3}$ to a vertex in $V_{4}$, and one edge joining a vertex in $V_{5}$ to a vertex in $V_{6}$. In $G' - S_{0}$, these three pairs each merge into a component with $6$ vertices (even), while $V_{7},V_{8},V_{9}$ remain as three disjoint $K_{3}$ components (odd).

Since it already has a perfect matching, it is not non-matchable and thus cannot be maximal non-matchable.\n\nOption D: $K_{1,7}$ has no perfect matching. In any perfect matching the center must be matched to exactly one leaf, leaving six leaves to be matched among themselves, but there are no edges among leaves, so condition (i) holds. However, maximality (ii) fails: adding any non-edge connects two leaves. In the resulting graph, one can match the center to a leaf and the added leaf-leaf edge, but the remaining four leaves are still pairwise non-adjacent and cannot be matched, so no perfect matching exists. Hence $K_{1,7}$ is not maximal non-matchable.\n\nOption C: The disjoint union $K_{3} \\sqcup (K_{5}-e)$ has no perfect matching since each component has odd order. It fails maximality (ii): consider adding the unique missing edge within the $K_{5}-e$ component to obtain $K_{3} \\sqcup K_{5}$, which is still the disjoint union of two odd-order components and thus has no perfect matching. Therefore it is not maximal non-matchable.\n\nOption A: Let $V=\\{v_{0},v_{1},\\dots,v_{7}\\}$, where $v_{0}$ is adjacent to all $v_{i}$ for $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,7\\}$, the induced subgraphs on $\\{v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}\\}$ and on $\\{v_{4},v_{5},v_{6}\\}$ are $K_{3}$, and no other edges exist besides these and those incident to $v_{0}$.

In each $K_{3}$, any matching covers exactly two vertices, leaving one unmatched; with two disjoint $K_{3}$, any matching in their union leaves two vertices unmatched and there is no edge between these two unmatched vertices (they lie in different components). Hence no perfect matching exists in the original graph, establishing condition (i).\n\nNext, verify maximality (ii) by checking all types of non-edges:\n- Non-edges of type 1: between $v_{7}$ and some $v_{i}$ with $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,6\\}$. After adding the edge $v_{7}v_{i}$, construct a perfect matching as follows. Use the edge $v_{7}v_{i}$. Let $T$ be the triangle containing $v_{i}$ and $T'$ the other triangle. Match the two remaining vertices of $T$ using their edge. Now the remaining four vertices are $v_{0}$ and the three vertices of $T'$. Match two vertices within $T'$ using one of its edges, and match $v_{0}$ to the remaining vertex of $T'$ (possible since $v_{0}$ is adjacent to all). This yields a perfect matching.\n- Non-edges of type 2: between a vertex $a \\in \\{v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}\\}$ and a vertex $b \\in \\{v_{4},v_{5},v_{6}\\}$. After adding the edge $ab$, construct a perfect matching by taking $v_{0}v_{7}$, the added edge $ab$, and then match the remaining two vertices in each triangle using one edge in each $K_{3}$. This covers all eight vertices and is a perfect matching.\n\nSince every non-edge falls into one of these two types and in each case the augmented graph admits a perfect matching, the graph in Option A is maximal non-matchable.\n\nTherefore, among the given options, only A satisfies the definition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1551756"}]}
