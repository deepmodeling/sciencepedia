This first practice provides a straightforward scenario to solidify your understanding of the core relationship in Euler's formula, $V - E + F = 2$. By applying it to a tangible problem like city planning, you'll see how this elegant equation connects the essential components of any planar graph.

The road network for this district can be modeled as a single connected planar graph, where road intersections are represented as vertices and the road segments connecting them are represented as edges. The areas enclosed by the roads, along with the single unbounded area surrounding the entire district, are the faces (or regions) of the graph. The final design consists of exactly 15 road segments. This network layout divides the map into a total of 8 distinct regions.

The design can be modeled as a graph, where electronic components are represented by vertices and the connections between them are represented by edges. For the design to be manufacturable on a single layer without wires overlapping, the graph representing the circuit must be planar.\n\nThe proposed architecture is a connected graph containing exactly 12 vertices. A key design constraint is that every vertex must be connected to exactly 3 other vertices; that is, every vertex has a degree of 3.

[@problem_id:1368114]", "problem": "A technology startup is designing a novel architecture for a Printed Circuit Board (PCB). The design consists of a network of 10 distinct connection points (vertices). The connections (edges) are laid out such that no two connections cross each other, forming a planar graph. For thermal and power-distribution reasons, the connection points are divided into two types, 'A' and 'B', and connections are only allowed between a point of Type A and a point of Type B. This makes the underlying graph a bipartite graph. The entire network must be connected, meaning there is a path of connections between any two points. A junior engineer proposes a design with a total of 17 connections.\n\nIs it possible to construct such a network? Analyze the proposal and select the correct conclusion from the options below.\n\nA. Yes, it is possible because the number of connections (17) is less than the maximum possible for a graph with 10 vertices, which is $\\binom{10}{2} = 45$.\n\nB.
