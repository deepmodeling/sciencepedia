A vertex is a cut vertex if removing it increases the number of connected components.\n\nConsider removing an endpoint $v_{1}$ or $v_{n}$. The remaining graph is the path $P_{n-1}$ when $n\\geq 3$, which is connected, so $c(P_{n}-v_{1})=c(P_{n}-v_{n})=1$, and the number of components does not increase. For $n=2$, removing an endpoint leaves $P_{1}$, which is also connected, so again there is no increase in the number of components. Hence, endpoints are not cut vertices for any $n\\geq 2$.\n\nNow consider removing an internal vertex $v_{k}$ with $2\\leq k\\leq n-1$.

Within $K_{4}$, removing any single vertex yields $K_{3}$, which is connected, and removing any single edge also leaves the graph connected. Thus, each $K_{4}$ alone has no cut vertices and no cut edges.\n\nIdentify cut vertices in $G$:\n- The only adjacency between $V_{A}$ and $V_{B}$ is via $e^{\\ast}=a_{4}b_{1}$. If $a_{4}$ is removed, then all edges incident to $a_{4}$, including $e^{\\ast}$, are removed.

Hence $a_{4}$ is a cut vertex. The same argument shows that removing $b_{1}$ disconnects $G$ into $K_{4}$ on $V_{A}$ and $K_{3}$ on $\\{b_{2},b_{3},b_{4}\\}$, so $b_{1}$ is a cut vertex.\n- If any $a_{i}$ with $i\\neq 4$ is removed, then $G_{A}$ becomes $K_{3}$ on the remaining three vertices, which is connected, and the edge $a_{4}b_{1}$ still connects $V_{A}$ to $V_{B}$.
