This exercise challenges you to engage with the famous Petersen graph, a classic example of a Class 2 graph, and guides you through the logic of a proof by contradiction to understand why it cannot be edge-colored with just three colors [@problem_id:1414300].", "problem": "In graph theory, a proper edge coloring of a graph $G$ is an assignment of colors to the edges of $G$ such that no two adjacent edges (i.e., edges that share a common vertex) have the same color. The minimum number of colors required for a proper edge coloring of $G$ is called the chromatic index, denoted $\\chi'(G)$.\n\nVizing's theorem states that for any simple graph, the chromatic index $\\chi'(G)$ is either equal to the maximum degree of its vertices, $\\Delta(G)$, or is $\\Delta(G) + 1$. Graphs for which $\\chi'(G) = \\Delta(G)$ are called Class 1, and graphs for which $\\chi'(G) = \\Delta(G) + 1$ are called Class 2.\n\nConsider the Petersen graph. The Petersen graph can be defined as the graph whose vertices are the 2-element subsets of a 5-element set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. Two vertices are adjacent if and only if their corresponding subsets are disjoint. This graph is a 3-regular graph (i.e., every vertex has degree 3), so its maximum degree is $\\Delta(G)=3$.\n\nTo determine if the Petersen graph is Class 1 or Class 2, one can attempt to construct a 3-edge-coloring. If a 3-edge-coloring exists, the graph is Class 1. If any attempt to create a 3-edge-coloring necessarily leads to a logical contradiction, the graph must be Class 2.\n\nAssume a 3-edge-coloring for the Petersen graph exists, using colors from the set $\\{c_1, c_2, c_3\\}$. Which of the following statements correctly identifies the contradiction that arises from this assumption?\n\nA. The color constraints imposed on the edges of the inner 5-cycle by the spokes (the edges connecting the inner and outer vertices) are inherently contradictory. An edge on the inner cycle is forced to have a certain color by one of its endpoints, which conflicts with the color constraints at its other endpoint.\n\nB. The contradiction arises immediately on the outer 5-cycle. It is impossible to assign 3 colors to the 5 edges of this cycle without two adjacent edges receiving the same color.\n\nC. Two spokes originating from adjacent vertices on the outer cycle are forced to have the same color. This is a contradiction because these two spokes connect to adjacent vertices on the inner 5-cycle.\n\nD. A 3-edge-coloring requires partitioning the graph's 15 edges into three sets of 5 disjoint edges (three perfect matchings). The contradiction is that the Petersen graph is non-Hamiltonian (contains no cycle that visits every vertex exactly once), and a non-Hamiltonian graph cannot be decomposed into perfect matchings.", "solution": "Assume for contradiction that the Petersen graph admits a proper 3-edge-coloring with colors $\\{c_{1},c_{2},c_{3}\\}$.\n\nBy definition of a proper edge coloring on a 3-regular graph, at every vertex the three incident edges receive three distinct colors; that is, at each vertex the multiset of incident edge colors is exactly $\\{c_{1},c_{2},c_{3}\\}$.\n\nConsider first the outer 5-cycle. There is no immediate obstruction to properly coloring its five edges with three colors, so no contradiction arises there; thus option B is false.\n\nNow use the spokes to transmit constraints to the inner 5-cycle. At any outer vertex, since the two outer-cycle edges incident there must have distinct colors from $\\{c_{1},c_{2},c_{3}\\}$, the spoke at that vertex is forced to be the third color (the unique color not used by those two edges). Hence, once the outer cycle edges are colored, every spoke color is uniquely determined.\n\nAt any inner vertex $v$, exactly one spoke and two inner-cycle edges are incident. Let the color of the spoke at $v$ be $c_{i}$. Then the two inner-cycle edges incident to $v$ must be colored with the other two colors, i.e., from the set $\\{c_{1},c_{2},c_{3}\\}\\setminus\\{c_{i}\\}$. Consequently, for any inner-cycle edge $uv$ whose endpoints are inner vertices $u$ and $v$ with spoke colors $c_{i}$ at $u$ and $c_{j}$ at $v$, the color of $uv$ is forced to be the unique element of the intersection\n$$\n\\bigl(\\{c_{1},c_{2},c_{3}\\}\\setminus\\{c_{i}\\}\\bigr)\\cap\\bigl(\\{c_{1},c_{2},c_{3}\\}\\setminus\\{c_{j}\\}\\bigr)\n=\n\\{c_{1},c_{2},c_{3}\\}\\setminus\\{c_{i},c_{j}\\}.\n$$\nThus each inner edge is forced by its two endpoints to be the unique color different from both spoke colors at its endpoints.\n\nTraverse the inner 5-cycle and propagate these forced colors: starting from any inner edge, its color is uniquely determined by the spoke colors at its endpoints. Moving to the next inner edge, its color is again uniquely determined, and so on. Because the inner cycle has odd length, after five steps the propagation returns to the starting edge but imposes a possibly different forced color. Since the forcing at each step is deterministic and depends only on the spoke colors at consecutive vertices, closure on an odd cycle necessarily yields a conflict: the starting edge is forced to be two distinct colors. Equivalently, the spokes impose pairwise endpoint constraints on inner edges that cannot be satisfied consistently around an odd cycle. This is the required contradiction. This matches statement A: an inner-cycle edge is forced by one endpoint to take a specific color that conflicts with the forced color from its other endpoint.\n\nFor completeness, we note:\n- B is false because a 5-cycle can be properly edge-colored with three colors.\n- C is false: there is no necessity that two spokes from adjacent outer vertices receive the same color, and in the standard structure of the Petersen graph those spokes do not connect to adjacent inner vertices.\n- D is false: being non-Hamiltonian does not preclude a cubic graph from decomposing into three perfect matchings; non-Hamiltonicity is unrelated to the existence of a 3-edge-coloring.\n\nTherefore, the correct identification of the contradiction is given by A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1414300"}]}
