We need to determine the number of such integers $n$.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to analyze the properties of the value of $\\phi(n)$, specifically its parity (whether it is even or odd). The target value in the equation is 11, which is an odd number.\n\nLet's examine the behavior of $\\phi(n)$ for different types of positive integers $n$.\n\nCase 1: $n = 1$.\nBy definition, the only positive integer less than or equal to 1 is 1. The greatest common divisor of 1 and 1 is $\\gcd(1,1) = 1$. So, there is one integer relatively prime to 1.\nTherefore, $\\phi(1) = 1$. Since $1 \\neq 11$, $n=1$ is not a solution.\n\nCase 2: $n = 2$.\nThe positive integers less than or equal to 2 are 1 and 2. The integer 1 is relatively prime to 2 since $\\gcd(1,2) = 1$. The integer 2 is not, since $\\gcd(2,2) = 2$. So, there is one integer relatively prime to 2.\nTherefore, $\\phi(2) = 1$. Since $1 \\neq 11$, $n=2$ is not a solution.\n\nCase 3: $n > 2$.\nWe will prove that for any integer $n > 2$, the value of $\\phi(n)$ is always an even number. We can use the formula for $\\phi(n)$ based on the prime factorization of $n$. Let the prime factorization of $n$ be $n = p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} \\cdots p_r^{k_r}$. The formula for $\\phi(n)$ is:\n$$ \\phi(n) = n \\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_i}\\right) = p_1^{k_1-1}(p_1-1) p_2^{k_2-1}(p_2-1) \\cdots p_r^{k_r-1}(p_r-1) $$\nWe can split this case into two sub-cases.\n\nSub-case 3a: $n$ is a power of 2.\nIf $n$ is a power of 2, since $n > 2$, we must have $n = 2^k$ for some integer $k \\geq 2$.\nUsing the formula, $\\phi(2^k) = 2^{k-1}(2-1) = 2^{k-1}$.\nSince $k \\geq 2$, the exponent $k-1 \\geq 1$. Thus, $\\phi(n) = 2^{k-1}$ is a power of 2 greater than or equal to 2, which is always an even number.\n\nSub-case 3b: $n$ has at least one odd prime factor.\nLet $p$ be an odd prime factor of $n$. So, $n$ can be written as $n = p^k \\cdot m$, where $k \\ge 1$ and $\\gcd(p^k, m) = 1$.\nThen $\\phi(n) = \\phi(p^k) \\phi(m) = p^{k-1}(p-1)\\phi(m)$.\nSince $p$ is an odd prime, $p \\ge 3$. This means $p-1$ is an even integer.\nAs $(p-1)$ is a factor of the expression for $\\phi(n)$, $\\phi(n)$ must be an even number.\n\nCombining these sub-cases, we see that for any integer $n > 2$, $\\phi(n)$ is always an even integer.\n\nNow we return to the original equation: $\\phi(n) = 11$.\nThe right-hand side, 11, is an odd number.\nFrom our analysis, if a solution $n$ exists, it must satisfy either $n=1$, $n=2$, or $n>2$.\n- If $n=1$ or $n=2$, we found $\\phi(n) = 1$, which is not 11.\n- If $n>2$, we found $\\phi(n)$ must be an even number. An even number can never be equal to the odd number 11.\n\nTherefore, there is no positive integer $n$, whether $n \\le 2$ or $n > 2$, for which $\\phi(n) = 11$.\nThis means that the equation has no solutions.\n\nThe correct statement is that there are no integers $n$ that satisfy the equation.

The case $p-1=8$ is impossible as $p=9$ is not prime. The only way to get a product of $8$ is $2\\cdot 4$, giving $n=3\\cdot 5=15$.
