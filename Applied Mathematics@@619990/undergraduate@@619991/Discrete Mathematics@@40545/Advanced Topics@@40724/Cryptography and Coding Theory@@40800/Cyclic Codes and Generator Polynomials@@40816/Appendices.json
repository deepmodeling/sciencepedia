We use polynomial identities, keeping in mind that arithmetic is modulo 2 (e.g., $2y = 0$ and $(a+b)^2 = a^2+2ab+b^2 = a^2+b^2$).\n\nWe can write $x^6 + 1$ as:\n$$x^6 + 1 = (x^3)^2 + 1^{2} = (x^3 + 1)^2$$\n\nNow, we factor the polynomial $x^3 + 1$. We can test for small roots. For $x=1$, we have $1^3 + 1 = 1+1=0$ in $GF(2)$. This means $(x-1)$, which is $(x+1)$ in $GF(2)$, is a factor of $x^3+1$. We can perform polynomial long division:\n$$\n\\frac{x^3+1}{x+1} = x^2+x+1\n$$\nSo, the factorization of $x^3+1$ is $(x+1)(x^2+x+1)$. The polynomial $x^2+x+1$ is irreducible over $GF(2)$ because it has no roots in $GF(2)$ (for $x=0$, it is $1$; for $x=1$, it is $1+1+1=1$).\n\nSubstituting this back into our expression for $x^6+1$:\n$$x^6 + 1 = ((x+1)(x^2+x+1))^2 = (x+1)^2(x^2+x+1)^2$$\n\nNow, we evaluate each of the given options:\n\n**A. $g(x) = x^2 + 1$**\nIn $GF(2)$, we have $(x+1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1 = x^2 + 1$. Since $(x+1)^2$ is a factor of $x^6+1$, $g(x) = x^2 + 1$ is a valid generator polynomial. Thus, option A is correct.\n\n**B. $g(x) = x^2 + x$**\nWe can factor this polynomial as $g(x) = x(x+1)$. For $g(x)$ to be a divisor of $x^6+1$, both of its factors, $x$ and $(x+1)$, must also be divisors of $x^6+1$. However, $x$ is not a divisor of $x^6+1$ because substituting $x=0$ into $x^6+1$ gives $0^6+1=1 \\neq 0$. Therefore, $g(x) = x^2+x$ is not a valid generator polynomial. Thus, option B is incorrect.\n\n**C. $g(x) = x^3 + x + 1$**\nThis is an irreducible polynomial over $GF(2)$. It is not one of the irreducible factors of $x^6+1$, which are $(x+1)$ and $(x^2+x+1)$. Therefore, $g(x) = x^3+x+1$ cannot be a divisor of $x^6+1$. Alternatively, we can perform long division of $x^6+1$ by $x^3+x+1$:\n$$\n(x^6+1) \\div (x^3+x+1) = x^3+x \\text{ with a remainder of } x^2\n$$\nSince there is a non-zero remainder, it is not a divisor. Thus, option C is incorrect.\n\n**D. $g(x) = x^2 + x + 1$**\nAs we found during the factorization of $x^6+1$, the polynomial $x^2+x+1$ is an irreducible factor of $x^3+1$, and therefore a factor of $(x^3+1)^2=x^6+1$. Thus, option D is correct.\n\n**E. $g(x) = x^4 + x + 1$**\nThis is an irreducible polynomial over $GF(2)$. It is not formed from the irreducible factors of $x^6+1$. To be certain, we can perform long division:\n$$\n(x^6+1) \\div (x^4+x+1) = x^2 \\text{ with a remainder of } x^3+x^2+1\n$$\nSince the remainder is non-zero, it is not a divisor.
