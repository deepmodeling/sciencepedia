A key part of the theorem is a constructive algorithm (often called Thompson's construction) to convert any regular expression into an equivalent Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA). This construction is inductive, building automata for complex expressions from the automata of their subexpressions.\n\nConsider two regular expressions over the alphabet $\\Sigma = \\{a, b\\}$:\n$R_1 = a^* b$\n$R_2 = b a^*$\n\nYour task is to construct an NFA for the language corresponding to the regular expression $R_1 | R_2$. You must strictly follow the standard inductive construction method taught in introductory courses, which we define as follows:\n1.  **Base Case**: For a symbol $x \\in \\Sigma$, the NFA has a start state and an accept state, with a single transition labeled $x$ between them.\n2.  **Union ($R|S$)**: Given NFAs $N(R)$ and $N(S)$, a new start state and a new accept state are created. Epsilon ($\\epsilon$) transitions are added from the new start state to the start states of both $N(R)$ and $N(S)$. Epsilon transitions are also added from the accept states of $N(R)$ and $N(S)$ to the new accept state.\n3.  **Concatenation ($RS$)**: Given NFAs $N(R)$ and $N(S)$, an epsilon transition is added from the accept state of $N(R)$ to the start state of $N(S)$. The start state of the new NFA is the start state of $N(R)$, and the accept state is the accept state of $N(S)$.\n4.  **Kleene Star ($R^*$)**: Given an NFA $N(R)$, a new start state and a new accept state are created. Epsilon transitions are added:\n    - From the new start state to the old start state of $N(R)$.\n    - From the old accept state of $N(R)$ to the new accept state.\n    - From the old accept state of $N(R)$ back to the old start state of $N(R)$ (to allow repetition).\n    - From the new start state directly to the new accept state (to allow the empty string).\n\nFollowing this procedure, first construct the NFAs for $R_1$ and $R_2$ individually, and then combine them using the union construction. Do not perform any simplifications, state reductions, or removal of epsilon transitions on the final resulting automaton.\n\nWhat is the total number of transitions in the final NFA for $R_1 | R_2$?

Therefore, $\\epsilon^*$ represents zero or more concatenations of the empty string.\n- Zero concatenations of $\\epsilon$ is the empty string, $\\epsilon$.\n- One concatenation of $\\epsilon$ is $\\epsilon$.\n- Two concatenations of $\\epsilon$ is $\\epsilon\\epsilon$, which is just $\\epsilon$.\n- And so on.\nThus, the only string that can be formed is the empty string. The language of $\\epsilon^*$ is $L(\\epsilon^*) = \\{\\epsilon\\}$.\n\nNow, let's follow the steps of a standard recursive construction (Thompson's construction) to build the NFA. The construction is based on the structure of the regular expression. The expression is $R^*$, where the sub-expression is $R = \\epsilon$.\n\n**Step 1: Construct the NFA for the base case, $R = \\epsilon$.**\nThe standard construction for the regular expression $\\epsilon$ creates an NFA with a start state and a final state, connected by a single transition on $\\epsilon$. Let's call the start state $q_1$ and the final state $q_2$.\n$$\nq_1 \\xrightarrow{\\epsilon} q_2\n$$\nSo, the NFA for $\\epsilon$ is $N_\\epsilon = (\\{q_1, q_2\\}, \\Sigma, \\delta_\\epsilon, q_1, \\{q_2\\})$, where $\\delta_\\epsilon(q_1, \\epsilon) = \\{q_2\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Kleene star construction to the NFA for $R = \\epsilon$.**\nTo construct an NFA for $R^*$, we take the NFA for $R$ (which is $N_\\epsilon$ in our case) and modify it as follows:\n1. Create a new start state, let's call it $q_0$.\n2. Create a new final state, let's call it $q_3$. The set of final states for the new NFA will be $F=\\{q_3\\}$.\n3. Add an $\\epsilon$-transition from the new start state $q_0$ to the old start state $q_1$.\n4. Add an $\\epsilon$-transition from the old final state $q_2$ to the new final state $q_3$.\n5. Add an $\\epsilon$-transition from the old final state $q_2$ back to the old start state $q_1$. This creates the \"zero or more\" loop.\n6. Add an $\\epsilon$-transition from the new start state $q_0$ directly to the new final state $q_3$. This handles the \"zero\" case, ensuring the empty string is accepted.\n\nLet's visualize the new connections based on $N_\\epsilon$:\n- New states: $q_0$ (start), $q_3$ (final).\n- Original NFA for $\\epsilon$: $q_1 \\xrightarrow{\\epsilon} q_2$.\n- Connection 3: $q_0 \\xrightarrow{\\epsilon} q_1$.\n- Connection 4: $q_2 \\xrightarrow{\\epsilon} q_3$.\n- Connection 5 (loop): $q_2 \\xrightarrow{\\epsilon} q_1$.\n- Connection 6 (bypass): $q_0 \\xrightarrow{\\epsilon} q_3$.\n\n**Step 3: Define the resulting NFA.**\nCombining these, the components of the final NFA for $\\epsilon^*$ are:\n- Set of states: $Q = \\{q_0, q_1, q_2, q_3\\}$.\n- Alphabet: $\\Sigma = \\{a\\}$ (though no symbols from it are used).\n- Start state: $q_0$.\n- Final states: $F = \\{q_3\\}$.\n- Transition function $\\delta$:\n    - From $q_0$, we have transitions to $q_1$ and $q_3$ on $\\epsilon$. So, $\\delta(q_0, \\epsilon) = \\{q_1, q_3\\}$.\n    - From $q_1$, we have the original transition to $q_2$ on $\\epsilon$. So, $\\delta(q_1, \\epsilon) = \\{q_2\\}$.\n    - From $q_2$, we have transitions to $q_3$ and back to $q_1$ on $\\epsilon$. So, $\\delta(q_2, \\epsilon) = \\{q_1, q_3\\}$.\n    - There are no other transitions. For any other state-input pair, the result is the empty set $\\emptyset$.\n\nThis NFA perfectly matches the description in Option A.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the language and evaluate the options.**\nThe language accepted by our constructed NFA is indeed $\\{\\epsilon\\}$. A string is accepted if there is a path from the start state $q_0$ to a final state ($q_3$) labeled with that string.\n- Path 1: $q_0 \\xrightarrow{\\epsilon} q_3$. This path consumes the empty string and ends in a final state. So, $\\epsilon$ is accepted.\n- Path 2: $q_0 \\xrightarrow{\\epsilon} q_1 \\xrightarrow{\\epsilon} q_2 \\xrightarrow{\\epsilon} q_3$. This path is a sequence of three $\\epsilon$-transitions, which again corresponds to consuming the empty string $\\epsilon$.\n- Any path involving the loop $q_2 \\to q_1$ will simply add more $\\epsilon$-transitions, still corresponding to the empty string.\nSince there are no transitions on the symbol 'a', no string containing 'a' can be accepted.\nTherefore, the language accepted is $L = \\{\\epsilon\\}$.\n\nThe NFA and the language in Option A are both correct.\n\nLet's briefly examine why the other options are incorrect:\n- **Option B:** The NFA shown is the result of the standard construction for the regular expression $a^*$. It accepts the language $\\{a^n \\mid n \\geq 0\\}$. This incorrectly treats $\\epsilon$ as the symbol $a$.\n- **Option C:** This NFA does accept the language $\\{\\epsilon\\}$. However, it is the standard construction for the regular expression $\\epsilon$, not $\\epsilon^*$. It lacks the additional states and feedback/bypass loops required by the star-construction rule.\n- **Option D:** This NFA has no final states, so it accepts no strings. Its language is the empty language, $\\emptyset$. This is incorrect because $L(\\epsilon^*) = \\{\\epsilon\\}$, which is not empty.\n- **Option E:** This is a minimal Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) for the language $a^* = \\{a^n \\mid n \\geq 0\\}$. The NFA and the language are both incorrect for the given regular expression $\\epsilon^*$.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the only choice that correctly presents both the NFA resulting from the standard construction and the language it recognizes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1379664"}]}
