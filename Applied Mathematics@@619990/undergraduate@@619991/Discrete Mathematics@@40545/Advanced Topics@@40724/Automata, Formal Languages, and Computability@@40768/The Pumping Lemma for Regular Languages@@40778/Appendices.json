The lemma’s precondition explicitly requires $s \\in L$.\n\nConsider the proposed choice $s=(ab)^p$. We check whether $s \\in L$ for arbitrary $p$.\n\nA necessary structural property of any string in $L$ is that it consists of a block of $a$’s followed by a block of $b$’s, with no occurrence of the substring $ba$. Equivalently, any $a^n b^n$ with $n \\ge 2$ contains the substring $aa$, and none contains the substring $ba$.\n\nOn the other hand, for $p \\ge 2$, the string $(ab)^p$ alternates symbols and therefore:\n- contains the substring $ba$, and\n- contains no substring $aa$.\n\nHence, for every $p \\ge 2$, we have $(ab)^p \\notin L$.

The student's work is presented below.\n\n**The Language:**\nLet $L$ be the language of all non-empty binary strings that represent even integers. This can be defined as the set of all strings over the alphabet $\\{0, 1\\}$ that end with a '0'.\n$L = \\{w \\in \\{0, 1\\}^* \\mid w \\text{ ends with a '0' and } |w| \\ge 1 \\}$\n\n**The Student's Argument:**\n\n1.  **Assumption:** Assume for the sake of contradiction that the language $L$ is regular.\n2.  **Pumping Length:** By the Pumping Lemma, there must exist a pumping length $p \\ge 1$ for $L$.\n3.  **String Selection:** I choose the string $s = 1^{p-1}0$. This string is in $L$ because it ends with a '0'. Its length is $|s| = p$, which satisfies the condition $|s| \\ge p$.\n4.  **Decomposition:** According to the Pumping Lemma, $s$ can be decomposed into three parts, $s = xyz$, such that the following conditions hold:\n    (i) $|xy| \\le p$\n    (ii) $|y| \\ge 1$\n    (iii) For all integers $i \\ge 0$, the string $xy^iz$ is in $L$.\n5.  **My Choice of Decomposition:** I will choose the decomposition as follows: $x = 1^{p-1}$, $y = 0$, and $z = \\epsilon$ (the empty string). This is a valid decomposition because $|xy| = |1^{p-1}0| = p \\le p$ and $|y| = |0| = 1 \\ge 1$.\n6.  **Pumping:** Now, I will test the pumping condition (iii). Let's choose $i=0$. The resulting string is $s' = xy^0z = xz = (1^{p-1})(\\epsilon) = 1^{p-1}$.\n7.  **Contradiction:** The string $s' = 1^{p-1}$ does not end with a '0'. Therefore, $s'$ is not in the language $L$. This contradicts condition (iii) of the Pumping Lemma.\n8.  **Conclusion:** Since my choice of string and decomposition led to a contradiction, the initial assumption must be false. Therefore, the language $L$ is not regular.\n\nThe student's conclusion is incorrect; the language $L$ is indeed regular. Which of the following statements correctly identifies the fundamental flaw in the student's argument?\n\nA. The argument incorrectly chooses a specific decomposition of the string $s$. A correct proof must demonstrate that for the chosen string $s$, a contradiction arises for *every* possible valid decomposition.\n\nB. The choice of string $s = 1^{p-1}0$ is faulty. To apply the Pumping Lemma, the length of the chosen string must be strictly greater than the pumping length $p$.\n\nC. The language $L$ is actually non-regular, but the argument fails by choosing $i=0$ to pump. A contradiction can only be achieved by pumping up (i.e., choosing $i \\ge 2$).\n\nD. The decomposition chosen in step 5, $x = 1^{p-1}, y=0, z=\\epsilon$, is not a valid decomposition because the substring $y$ cannot consist of the last character of the string $s$.\n\nE. The string $s' = 1^{p-1}$ does not cause a contradiction because the Pumping Lemma only applies to strings whose length is at least $p$, and the length of $s'$ is $p-1$.", "solution": "Define the language as $L=\\{w\\in\\{0,1\\}^{*}:\\ |w|\\ge 1\\ \\text{and }w\\text{ ends in }0\\}$, which is regular (recognized by a DFA with two states tracking the last bit).

They choose $s=1^{p-1}0$, which satisfies $|s|=p$ and $s\\in L$, so this choice is valid because the lemma requires $|s|\\ge p$, not $|s|>p$. Next, they choose a particular decomposition $x=1^{p-1}$, $y=0$, $z=\\epsilon$, and then pump with $i=0$ to obtain $xy^{0}z=1^{p-1}\\notin L$. However, this does not contradict the lemma, because the lemma only guarantees the existence of at least one decomposition for which all pumped strings remain in $L$; it does not require that every valid decomposition must have this property. Thus, exhibiting a single decomposition that fails does not refute regularity.\n\nIndeed, for the same $s=1^{p-1}0$, there exists a decomposition that satisfies the lemma’s conclusion, for example\n$$\nx=1^{p-2},\\quad y=1,\\quad z=0,\n$$\nwhich satisfies $|xy|=p-1\\le p$ and $|y|=1\\ge 1$, and for all $i\\ge 0$,\n$$\nxy^{i}z=1^{p-2}1^{i}0=1^{p-2+i}0\\in L,\n$$\nsince the string still ends with $0$. Therefore, the student’s “contradiction” arises only because they selected a decomposition that does not pump, which is compatible with regularity. To refute regularity, they would have to show that for their chosen $s$, every valid decomposition leads to some $i$ for which $xy^{i}z\\notin L$, which they did not and cannot do here.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental flaw is the incorrect use of the quantifiers in the Pumping Lemma: the student improperly fixed a specific decomposition rather than arguing that all valid decompositions fail. Option B is incorrect because $|s|=p$ is allowed. Option C is false because $L$ is regular. Option D is false because $y$ may be the last character. Option E is false because the lemma imposes no length requirement on $xy^{i}z$; only the original $s$ must satisfy $|s|\\ge p$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1410583"}, {"introduction": "Having mastered the critical steps of string selection and logical decomposition, you are now prepared to construct a complete proof from start to finish.
