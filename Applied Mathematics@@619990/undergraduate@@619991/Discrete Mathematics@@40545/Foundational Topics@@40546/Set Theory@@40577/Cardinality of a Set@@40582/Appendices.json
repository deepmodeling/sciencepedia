If $ax+b=cx+d$ as polynomials, then for all $x$ we have $(a-c)x+(b-d)=0$. The only polynomial identically equal to $0$ is the zero polynomial, which forces $a-c=0$ and $b-d=0$, hence $a=c$ and $b=d$. Therefore the rule $f(ax+b)=(a,b)$ assigns a unique ordered pair to each polynomial.\n\nTo show injectivity, let $p(x)=ax+b$ and $q(x)=cx+d$ be in $P_{1}$, and suppose $f(p)=f(q)$. Then $(a,b)=(c,d)$, hence $a=c$ and $b=d$, which implies $p=q$.
