Instead of counting subsets of a single set, we will count pairs of subsets $(A, B)$ that satisfy a specific condition [@problem_id:1409465]. The solution reveals an elegant method: consider the 'fate' of each individual element, a strategy that is fundamental to solving many complex counting problems in discrete mathematics.", "problem": "In a distributed computing system, a set of $n$ distinct computational tasks, denoted by the set $S = \\{t_1, t_2, \\ldots, t_n\\}$, needs to be allocated to two processing clusters, Cluster A and Cluster B.

Both $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $S$.\n\nThe system has a critical redundancy requirement: every task must be assigned to at least one of the two clusters to ensure that no task is dropped. This means that for any valid allocation $(A, B)$, the union of the sets $A$ and $B$ must be equal to the entire set of tasks $S$.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{P}(S)$ represent the power set of $S$.

We are looking for the number of ordered pairs of subsets $(A, B)$ such that $A \\subseteq S$, $B \\subseteq S$, and $A \\cup B = S$.\n\nA common and effective method for this type of combinatorial problem is to consider the placement of each individual element of the set $S$. Let's analyze the possible locations for an arbitrary element $x \\in S$ with respect to the sets $A$ and $B$.\n\nFor any given element $x \\in S$, there are four a priori possibilities for its membership in the pair of sets $(A, B)$:\n1.  $x \\in A$ and $x \\notin B$\n2.  $x \\notin A$ and $x \\in B$\n3.  $x \\in A$ and $x \\in B$\n4.  $x \\notin A$ and $x \\notin B$\n\nThe problem states the condition that $A \\cup B = S$. This means that for every element $x \\in S$, it must be true that $x \\in A \\cup B$. Let's examine how this condition impacts the four possibilities listed above.\n\n- If $x \\in A$ and $x \\notin B$, then $x \\in A \\cup B$. This is a valid placement.\n- If $x \\notin A$ and $x \\in B$, then $x \\in A \\cup B$. This is also a valid placement.\n- If $x \\in A$ and $x \\in B$, then $x \\in A \\cup B$. This is also a valid placement.\n- If $x \\notin A$ and $x \\notin B$, then $x \\notin A \\cup B$. This would imply $A \\cup B \\neq S$, which violates the given condition. Therefore, this fourth case is forbidden.\n\nSo, for each element $x \\in S$, there are exactly 3 valid ways to place it into the pair of sets $(A, B)$ to satisfy the condition $A \\cup B = S$.\n\nThe set $S$ contains $n$ distinct elements: $\\{t_1, t_2, \\ldots, t_n\\}$. The decision of where to place one element $t_i$ is independent of the decision of where to place any other element $t_j$ for $i \\neq j$.\n\n- For the first element $t_1$, there are 3 choices.\n- For the second element $t_2$, there are 3 choices.\n- ...\n- For the $n$-th element $t_n$, there are 3 choices.\n\nBy the fundamental principle of counting (the multiplication rule), the total number of ways to form the ordered pair $(A, B)$ is the product of the number of choices for each element. Since there are $n$ elements and 3 choices for each, the total number of valid pairs is:\n$$ \\underbrace{3 \\times 3 \\times \\cdots \\times 3}_{n \\text{ times}} = 3^n $$\n\nThus, there are $3^n$ ordered pairs of subsets $(A, B)$ of $S$ such that $A \\cup B = S$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3^{n}}$$", "id": "1409465"}]}
