The platform's configuration can be customized by enabling or disabling a specific set of five optional modules: a Machine Learning toolkit, a real-time Streaming processor, a distributed File System connector, an advanced Visualization engine, and a security Auditing logger. For a configuration to be considered a \"valid custom build,\" it must satisfy two conditions: it must include at least one optional module, and it cannot include all five optional modules simultaneously. How many distinct \"valid custom builds\" are possible?", "solution": "Let the set of optional modules be a set $M$ with $|M|=5$. Any configuration corresponds to a subset $S \\subseteq M$, where a module is enabled if and only if it is included in $S$.\n\nThe total number of possible configurations (including enabling none or all) is $2^{5}$, since each of the $5$ modules can be either enabled or disabled independently.\n\nA \"valid custom build\" must satisfy two conditions:\n- It includes at least one module: this excludes the empty set, which contributes $\\binom{5}{0}=1$ configuration.\n- It does not include all five modules: this excludes the full set $M$, which contributes $\\binom{5}{5}=1$ configuration.\n\nTherefore, the number of valid custom builds is\n$$\n2^{5}-\\binom{5}{0}-\\binom{5}{5}=2^{5}-1-1=32-2=30.\n$$\nEquivalently, summing over allowed sizes gives\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{4}\\binom{5}{k}=\\binom{5}{1}+\\binom{5}{2}+\\binom{5}{3}+\\binom{5}{4}=5+10+10+5=30.\n$$\nHence, there are $30$ distinct valid custom builds.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{30}$$", "id": "1403041"}, {"introduction": "Building on basic counting, this problem introduces a more complex system where states are defined by the interaction of multiple components, a perfect use case for Cartesian products.
