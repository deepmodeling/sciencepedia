A universally quantified statement (\"for all integers $n$...\") is proven true if it holds for every possible integer case, and it is proven false by finding a single counterexample. We will use the property that any integer $n$ can be expressed in the form $n = qk + r$, where $q$ is the quotient, $k$ is the divisor, and $r$ is the remainder such that $0 \\le r < |k|$. This is equivalent to using modular arithmetic.\n\n**Statement A: For all integers $n$, the expression $n^3 - n$ is divisible by 3.**\nWe can analyze this statement by considering the possible remainders of an integer $n$ when divided by 3. The remainder can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\nCase 1: $n$ has a remainder of 0 when divided by 3.\nThis means $n = 3k$ for some integer $k$. In modular notation, $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\nThen, $n^3 - n \\equiv 0^3 - 0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. So, $n^3 - n$ is divisible by 3.\n\nCase 2: $n$ has a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.\nThis means $n = 3k + 1$ for some integer $k$. In modular notation, $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.\nThen, $n^3 - n \\equiv 1^3 - 1 \\equiv 1 - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. So, $n^3 - n$ is divisible by 3.\n\nCase 3: $n$ has a remainder of 2 when divided by 3.\nThis means $n = 3k + 2$ for some integer $k$. In modular notation, $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$.\nThen, $n^3 - n \\equiv 2^3 - 2 \\equiv 8 - 2 \\equiv 6 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. So, $n^3 - n$ is divisible by 3.\n\nSince $n^3 - n$ is divisible by 3 for all possible remainders of $n$ when divided by 3, the statement is true for all integers $n$.\nAlternatively, we can factor the expression: $n^3 - n = n(n^2 - 1) = n(n-1)(n+1) = (n-1)n(n+1)$. This is the product of three consecutive integers. In any set of three consecutive integers, one must be a multiple of 3. Therefore, their product is always divisible by 3.\nStatement A is true.\n\n**Statement B: For all integers $n$, the expression $n^2 - n$ is divisible by 2.**\nWe use a similar case analysis for an integer $n$ divided by 2. The remainder can be 0 or 1.\n\nCase 1: $n$ is even. $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$, or $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$.\nThen, $n^2 - n \\equiv 0^2 - 0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$. So, $n^2 - n$ is divisible by 2.\n\nCase 2: $n$ is odd. $n = 2k + 1$ for some integer $k$, or $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$.\nThen, $n^2 - n \\equiv 1^2 - 1 \\equiv 1 - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$. So, $n^2 - n$ is divisible by 2.\n\nSince the property holds in all cases, the statement is true for all integers $n$.\nAlternatively, factoring gives $n^2 - n = n(n-1)$. This is the product of two consecutive integers. One integer in any consecutive pair must be even, so their product is always divisible by 2.\nStatement B is true.\n\n**Statement C: For all integers $n$, the expression $n^5 - n$ is divisible by 5.**\nWe analyze this based on the remainder of $n$ upon division by 5. The remainders can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nCase 1: $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$. Then $n^5 - n \\equiv 0^5 - 0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$.\nCase 2: $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$. Then $n^5 - n \\equiv 1^5 - 1 \\equiv 1 - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$.\nCase 3: $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$. Then $n^5 - n \\equiv 2^5 - 2 \\equiv 32 - 2 \\equiv 30 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$.\nCase 4: $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$. Then $n^5 - n \\equiv 3^5 - 3 \\equiv 243 - 3 \\equiv 240 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$. (Since $240 = 5 \\times 48$).\nCase 5: $n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$. Then $n^5 - n \\equiv 4^5 - 4 \\equiv (4^2)^2 \\cdot 4 - 4 \\equiv (16)^2 \\cdot 4 - 4 \\equiv 1^2 \\cdot 4 - 4 \\equiv 4 - 4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$.\n\nSince $n^5 - n$ is divisible by 5 for all possible integer cases modulo 5, the statement is true for all integers $n$. This is also a direct consequence of Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that $n^p - n$ is divisible by prime $p$ for any integer $n$. Here, $p=5$.\nStatement C is true.\n\n**Statement D: For all integers $n$, the expression $n^4 - n$ is divisible by 4.**\nTo test this \"for all\" statement, we can look for a counterexample. Let's try a simple integer value for $n$.\n\nLet $n=2$.\nThe expression evaluates to $2^4 - 2 = 16 - 2 = 14$.\nIs 14 divisible by 4? No, because $14 = 4 \\times 3 + 2$. The remainder is 2, not 0.\nSince we have found an integer $n=2$ for which $n^4 - n$ is not divisible by 4, the statement \"For all integers $n$, the expression $n^4 - n$ is divisible by 4\" is false.\nStatement D is false.\n\nIn summary, statements A, B, and C are true, while statement D is false.
