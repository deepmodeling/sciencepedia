Often, an initial logical design for a system, like the alarm in this problem, is functionally correct but overly complex. By applying the laws of logic, we can systematically simplify these expressions to create systems that are more efficient, less costly, and easier to debug. This exercise challenges you to apply these simplification techniques to a practical scenario, honing your ability to manipulate and streamline logical statements [@problem_id:1382337].", "problem": "A company is designing a sophisticated alarm system for a high-security vault. The logic for triggering the alarm is getting complicated, and they need to simplify it to reduce the number of logic gates and potential points of failure. The current logic is based on two sensor inputs:\n- Let $p$ be the proposition \"The vault's primary lock is engaged.\"\n- Let $q$ be the proposition \"The internal pressure sensor has been tripped.\"\n\nThe alarm, $A$, is set to sound if the following complex logical condition is met:\n$$ \\neg(p \\rightarrow \\neg q) \\lor (\\neg p \\land \\neg q) $$\nThe engineering team wants to replace this complex expression with a logically equivalent but simpler one.

We use the Law of Implication, which states that $X \\rightarrow Y$ is logically equivalent to $\\neg X \\lor Y$.
