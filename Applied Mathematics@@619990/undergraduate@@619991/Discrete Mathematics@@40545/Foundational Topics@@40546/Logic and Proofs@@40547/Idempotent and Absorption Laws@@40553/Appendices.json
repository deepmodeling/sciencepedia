The student justifies this step by claiming it is a direct application of the Absorption Law.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for the logical error in the student's reasoning?\n\nA. The simplification is incorrect because the Absorption Law, which is correctly stated as $A + AB = A$, cannot be applied. The student's expression $X + X'Y$ does not match the required form, as the second term's Boolean product must contain the variable $X$ itself, not its complement $X'$.\n\nB.

The student's reasoning is flawed because the expression $X + X'Y$ cannot be simplified further and must be left in its original form.\n\nD. The simplification is incorrect because the correct law to apply is the Distributive Law, which simplifies the expression to $F(X,Y)=Y$ because $X+X'$ cancels out.\n\nE.

Specifically, the law requires the same variable (not its complement) to appear as the common factor.\n\nConsider the student's expression $F(X,Y) = X + X'Y$. To apply the Absorption Law $A + AB = A$, the second term would need to be of the form $XY$, not $X'Y$. Since the product term contains $X'$ instead of $X$, the expression $X + X'Y$ does not match the required form of the Absorption Law. Therefore, the law cannot be directly applied, which is the fundamental error in the student's reasoning.\n\nTo see the correct simplification path and to confirm that $X + X'Y \\neq X$ in general, use the distributive identity $a + bc = (a + b)(a + c)$:\n$$X + X'Y = (X + X')(X + Y).$$\nUsing the complementarity law $X + X' = 1$, we get\n$$(X + X')(X + Y) = 1 \\cdot (X + Y) = X + Y,$$\nby the identity law $1 \\cdot Z = Z$. Thus the correct simplification is $X + X'Y = X + Y$, not $X$.\n\nA concrete counterexample also demonstrates the student's result is not generally valid: if $X = 0$ and $Y = 1$, then\n$$X + X'Y = 0 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 1 \\neq 0 = X.$$\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is that the Absorption Law cannot be applied because the given expression does not match its required form; the second term must contain $X$, not $X'$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$"}]}
