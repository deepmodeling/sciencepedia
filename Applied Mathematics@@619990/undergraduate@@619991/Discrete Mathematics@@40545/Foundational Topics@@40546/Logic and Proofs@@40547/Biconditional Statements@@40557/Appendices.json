First, let's analyze the original expression: $(p \\land q) \\lor (\\neg p \\land \\neg q)$. We evaluate this expression for all possible truth values of the propositional variables $p$ and $q$.\n\nThe four possible combinations of truth values for $p$ and $q$ are:\n1.  $p$ is True (T), $q$ is True (T)\n2.  $p$ is True (T), $q$ is False (F)\n3.  $p$ is False (F), $q$ is True (T)\n4.  $p$ is False (F), $q$ is False (F)\n\nLet's evaluate the original expression for each case:\nCase 1: $p=T, q=T$. The expression is $(T \\land T) \\lor (\\neg T \\land \\neg T) = T \\lor (F \\land F) = T \\lor F = T$.\nCase 2: $p=T, q=F$.
