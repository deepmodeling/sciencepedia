What is the minimum number of new professors that must be hired to guarantee that at least one pair of them will be assigned offices with consecutive numbers, regardless of which specific offices are chosen for them?", "solution": "Let the available offices be the integers $1,2,\\dots,100$.\n\nFirst, construct a set of offices with no consecutive numbers of maximal size to obtain a lower bound.

We will discover that any sufficiently long sequence of distinct numbers, such as daily stock prices, must contain an ordered subsequence of a certain length [@problem_id:1393075].

The analyst observes that for the period under consideration, all daily closing prices are distinct real numbers. The analyst is looking for specific long-term patterns, which they define as follows: An \"uptrend\" is a subsequence of days where the closing prices are strictly increasing, and a \"downtrend\" is a subsequence of days where the closing prices are strictly decreasing. Note that the days forming the subsequence do not need to be consecutive.\n\nThe analyst wants to determine the minimum number of trading days they must observe to be absolutely certain that the historical data contains either an uptrend of length 5 or a downtrend of length 4.\n\nWhat is this minimum number of trading days?", "solution": "Let the sequence of distinct daily closing prices over $N$ days be $P = (x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_N)$. We are looking for the minimum integer $N$ that guarantees the existence of either an increasing subsequence of length $r=5$ or a decreasing subsequence of length $s=4$. This is a classic combinatorial problem related to the Erdős–Szekeres theorem. We can solve it from first principles.\n\nLet's associate a pair of integers, $(i_k, d_k)$, with each price $x_k$ in the sequence, for $k = 1, 2, \\dots, N$.\n- $i_k$ is the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the term $x_k$.\n- $d_k$ is the length of the longest decreasing subsequence that ends with the term $x_k$.\n\nFirst, we will prove that all these $N$ pairs $(i_k, d_k)$ must be distinct. We can prove this by contradiction. Assume there exist two distinct indices $j$ and $k$ such that $j  k$ but $(i_j, d_j) = (i_k, d_k)$. Let's denote this common pair by $(i, d)$.\n\nSince $j  k$ and all prices are distinct, we have two possibilities: $x_j  x_k$ or $x_j > x_k$.\n\nCase 1: $x_j  x_k$.\nThere exists a longest increasing subsequence ending at $x_j$ of length $i_j = i$. We can take this subsequence and append $x_k$ to it, since $x_j  x_k$. This forms a new increasing subsequence ending at $x_k$ with a length of $i_j + 1 = i + 1$. Therefore, the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at $x_k$, which is $i_k$, must be at least $i+1$. So, $i_k \\ge i+1$. However, we assumed that $i_k = i_j = i$. This leads to the contradiction $i \\ge i+1$.\n\nCase 2: $x_j > x_k$.\nThere exists a longest decreasing subsequence ending at $x_j$ of length $d_j = d$. We can take this subsequence and append $x_k$ to it, since $x_j > x_k$. This forms a new decreasing subsequence ending at $x_k$ with a length of $d_j + 1 = d + 1$. Therefore, the length of the longest decreasing subsequence ending at $x_k$, which is $d_k$, must be at least $d+1$. So, $d_k \\ge d+1$. However, we assumed that $d_k = d_j = d$. This leads to the contradiction $d \\ge d+1$.\n\nSince both cases lead to a contradiction, our initial assumption must be false. Thus, for any $j \\neq k$, we must have $(i_j, d_j) \\neq (i_k, d_k)$. All $N$ pairs are unique.\n\nNow, let's assume for the sake of contradiction that the sequence of $N$ prices has no uptrend of length $r=5$ and no downtrend of length $s=4$. This assumption places constraints on the possible values of $i_k$ and $d_k$.\nIf there is no increasing subsequence of length 5, then any increasing subsequence must have length at most 4. This implies that the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at any $x_k$, which is $i_k$, must be in the range $1 \\le i_k \\le r-1 = 4$.\nSimilarly, if there is no decreasing subsequence of length 4, then any decreasing subsequence must have length at most 3. This implies that the length of the longest decreasing subsequence ending at any $x_k$, which is $d_k$, must be in the range $1 \\le d_k \\le s-1 = 3$.\n\nSo, under our assumption, every pair $(i_k, d_k)$ must be an element of the Cartesian product $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\times \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. The total number of distinct pairs possible is $(r-1)(s-1) = 4 \\times 3 = 12$.\n\nWe have a sequence of $N$ prices, and we have shown that each price $x_k$ corresponds to a unique pair $(i_k, d_k)$. According to the Pigeonhole Principle, if we want to assign $N$ items (the prices) to $N$ unique pairs, we need at least $N$ possible pairs.\nIf we choose a sequence of length $N > (r-1)(s-1) = 12$, we would need more than 12 unique pairs. But under our assumption, there are only 12 possible pairs. This is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the assumption that no such long subsequences exist must be false for any $N > (r-1)(s-1)$. The minimum integer value of $N$ for which this guarantee holds is $N = (r-1)(s-1) + 1$.\n\nSubstituting the given values $r=5$ and $s=4$:\n$N = (5-1)(4-1) + 1$\n$N = (4)(3) + 1$\n$N = 12 + 1$\n$N = 13$\n\nThus, a minimum of 13 trading days must be observed to guarantee either an uptrend of length 5 or a downtrend of length 4.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{13}$$", "id": "1393075"}]}
