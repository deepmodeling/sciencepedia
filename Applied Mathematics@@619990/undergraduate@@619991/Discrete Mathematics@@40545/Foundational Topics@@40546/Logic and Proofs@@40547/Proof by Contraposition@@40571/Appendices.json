A proof by contraposition involves proving that the contrapositive statement is true, which is logically equivalent to proving the original proposition is true.\n\nThe original proposition is a conditional statement of the form \"If $P$, then $Q$\".

Let's determine the negations of $Q$ and $P$.\n\nThe negation of the conclusion, $\\neg Q$, is:\n\"The integers $a$ and $b$ do not have different parity.\"\nThis is equivalent to saying: \"The integers $a$ and $b$ have the same parity\" (i.e., both are even or both are odd).\n\nThe negation of the hypothesis, $\\neg P$, is:\n\"The expression $7a + 11b$ is not an odd integer.\"\nFor an integer, not being odd is equivalent to being even. So, $\\neg P$ is: \"The expression $7a + 11b$ is an even integer.\"\n\nNow, we construct the contrapositive statement, \"If $\\neg Q$, then $\\neg P$\":\n\"If $a$ and $b$ have the same parity, then $7a + 11b$ is an even integer.\"\n\nThis statement matches option A.\n\nTo demonstrate that this is the correct path for the proof, we can proceed to prove this contrapositive statement. We must consider two cases for \"$a$ and $b$ have the same parity\".\n\nCase 1: Both $a$ and $b$ are even.\nIf $a$ and $b$ are even, we can write them as $a = 2k$ and $b = 2m$ for some integers $k$ and $m$.\nSubstituting these into the expression:\n$7a + 11b = 7(2k) + 11(2m) = 14k + 22m = 2(7k + 11m)$.\nSince $k$ and $m$ are integers, $7k + 11m$ is also an integer. Therefore, $2(7k + 11m)$ is an even number.\n\nCase 2: Both $a$ and $b$ are odd.\nIf $a$ and $b$ are odd, we can write them as $a = 2k + 1$ and $b = 2m + 1$ for some integers $k$ and $m$.\nSubstituting these into the expression:\n$7a + 11b = 7(2k + 1) + 11(2m + 1) = (14k + 7) + (22m + 11) = 14k + 22m + 18 = 2(7k + 11m + 9)$.\nSince $k$ and $m$ are integers, $7k + 11m + 9$ is also an integer. Therefore, $2(7k + 11m + 9)$ is an even number.\n\nIn both cases where $a$ and $b$ have the same parity, the expression $7a + 11b$ is even. This proves the contrapositive statement. Since the contrapositive is true, the original proposition is also true.\n\nLet's briefly analyze the other options:\n- Option B is the converse (\"If $Q$, then $P$\"). Proving the converse does not prove the original statement.\n- Option C is the inverse (\"If $\\neg P$, then $\\neg Q$\"). Proving the inverse does not prove the original statement. Note that the inverse is the contrapositive of the converse.\n- Option D incorrectly states the conclusion for the contrapositive's hypothesis.\n- Option E is the negation of the converse.\n\nTherefore, the only correct statement that must be proven to validate the original proposition via proof by contraposition is the contrapositive itself.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1393272"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the concrete world of integers to the abstract realm of functions, this practice demonstrates the versatility of proof by contraposition.
