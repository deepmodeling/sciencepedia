Let the rows be $v,w \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}^{2}$. A matrix is nonsingular if and only if $v$ and $w$ are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{R}$. There are $9$ row vectors total; one is the zero vector, which never yields independence. For any nonzero $v$, its scalar multiples $kv$ lying in $\\{-1,0,1\\}^{2}$ are exactly $\\{-v,0,v\\}$, hence exactly $3$ colinear choices.

Symmetric means $b=c$, so write $A=\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ b & d \\end{pmatrix}$ with $a,b,d \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$. Then $\\det(A)=ad-b^{2}$, and singularity requires $ad=b^{2}$.\n\nIf $b=0$, then $b^{2}=0$ and $ad=0$. Among the $9$ pairs $(a,d)$, exactly those with at least one of $a$ or $d$ equal to $0$ satisfy $ad=0$, yielding $5$ solutions.\n\nIf $b=\\pm 1$, then $b^{2}=1$ and $ad=1$, which occurs exactly for $(a,d)=(1,1)$ or $(-1,-1)$, giving $2$ solutions for each choice of $b$.
