This is an existential quantifier, $\\exists x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, such that $ax=b$.\n\nSo, the statement $S$ can be written in logical notation as:\n$$S: \\forall a \\in \\mathbb{Z}, \\forall b \\in \\mathbb{Z}, \\exists x \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\text{ such that } (ax=b)$$\n\nTo negate a quantified statement, we use De Morgan's laws for quantifiers. The rules are:\n1. $\\neg(\\forall y, P(y)) \\equiv \\exists y, \\neg P(y)$\n2. $\\neg(\\exists y, P(y)) \\equiv \\forall y, \\neg P(y)$\n\nBroadly, to negate a statement with a series of quantifiers, we change each quantifier to its opposite (universal $\\forall$ becomes existential $\\exists$, and vice versa) and then negate the predicate at the end.\n\nLet's apply this to our statement $S$. The negation is $\\neg S$.\n$$ \\neg S \\equiv \\neg(\\forall a \\in \\mathbb{Z}, \\forall b \\in \\mathbb{Z}, \\exists x \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\text{ such that } (ax=b)) $$\n\nWe apply the negation rule from left to right.\nFirst, negate the outermost quantifier `$\\forall a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$`:\n$$ \\neg S \\equiv \\exists a \\in \\mathbb{Z}, \\neg(\\forall b \\in \\mathbb{Z}, \\exists x \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\text{ such that } (ax=b)) $$\n\nNext, negate the second quantifier `$\\forall b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$`:\n$$ \\neg S \\equiv \\exists a \\in \\mathbb{Z}, \\exists b \\in \\mathbb{Z}, \\neg(\\exists x \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\text{ such that } (ax=b)) $$\n\nFinally, negate the innermost part `$\\exists x \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\text{ such that } (ax=b)$`. The negation of \"there exists an integer $x$ such that $ax=b$\" is \"for all integers $x$, it is not the case that $ax=b$\", or more simply, \"there is no integer $x$ such that $ax=b$\".\nFormally, $\\neg(\\exists x \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\text{ such that } (ax=b))$ becomes $\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{Z}, \\neg(ax=b)$, which is $\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{Z}, (ax \\ne b)$.\n\nSo, the complete negation in formal notation is:\n$$ \\neg S \\equiv \\exists a \\in \\mathbb{Z}, \\exists b \\in \\mathbb{Z}, \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{Z}, (ax \\ne b) $$\n\nNow we translate this back into English. The statement reads: \"There exists an integer $a$ and there exists an integer $b$ such that for all integers $x$, $ax \\ne b$.\"\nThis is logically equivalent to saying: \"There exists an integer $a$ and there exists an integer $b$ such that the equation $ax=b$ has no integer solution for $x$.\"\n\nLet's compare this with the given options:\n- A. \"For every integer $a$ and for every integer $b$, the equation $ax=b$ does not have an integer solution for $x$.\" This is incorrect because it fails to change the universal quantifiers ($\\forall$) to existential quantifiers ($\\exists$).\n- B. \"There exists an integer $a$ and there exists an integer $b$ such that the equation $ax=b$ does not have an integer solution for $x$.\" This exactly matches our derived negation. For instance, if we choose $a=2$ and $b=1$, the equation $2x=1$ has no integer solution for $x$.\n- C. \"There exists an integer $a$ such that for every integer $b$, the equation $ax=b$ does not have an integer solution for $x$.\" This is incorrect. It changes the second quantifier from `for every` to `there exists`, but then incorrectly swaps its position and sense. Our negation is $\\exists a, \\exists b, \\ldots$, not $\\exists a, \\forall b, \\ldots$.\n- D. \"For every integer $a$, there exists an integer $b$ such that the equation $ax=b$ does not have an integer solution for $x$.\" This is incorrect. It only negates the second and third parts of the statement, leaving the first quantifier \"For every integer $a$\" unchanged.\n- E. \"There exists an integer $a$ and there exists an integer $b$ such that the equation $ax=b$ has a solution for $x$ which is not an integer.\" This is not the negation. The original statement claims an integer solution exists. The negation is that an integer solution does *not* exist. It does not make any claim about the existence of non-integer solutions.\n\nTherefore, the correct logical negation is given in option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1387323"}, {"introduction": "This final practice challenge elevates your skills to the level required in advanced mathematics, such as real analysis.
