This practice introduces the powerful technique of proof by cases, which is essential when a situation can be divided into a finite set of scenarios ($A \\lor B$). By examining a set of rules for a network security gateway, you will see how to logically guarantee a conclusion by proving it holds true in every possible case [@problem_id:1350100].", "problem": "A network security gateway is programmed with a set of rules to handle incoming data packets.

This technique involves assuming the opposite of what one wishes to prove and then demonstrating that this assumption leads to a logical absurdity. This final practice invites you to deconstruct one of the most famous examples of this method—the proof that there is no largest prime number—to appreciate how fundamental logical steps can be chained together to build a powerful and undeniable argument [@problem_id:1350106].", "problem": "In a discrete mathematics course, students are tasked with analyzing the structure of a proof by contradiction. The goal is to prove that the set of prime numbers is infinite. Consider the following sequence of statements that form the basis of such a proof:\n\n*   **S1 (Assumption for Contradiction):** Assume there is a finite number of prime numbers. Let this complete set of all primes be denoted as $\\{p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k\\}$, where $p_k$ is the largest prime number.\n*   **S2 (Construction):** Construct a new integer $N$ defined as $N = (p_1 \\cdot p_2 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot p_k) + 1$.\n*   **S3 (Fundamental Premise):** For any integer $n > 1$, there exists at least one prime number $p$ such that $p$ divides $n$.\n*   **S4 (Property of N):** For any prime $p_i$ from the set $\\{p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k\\}$, dividing $N$ by $p_i$ leaves a remainder of 1.\n\nGiven these four statements, which of the following options represents the valid logical deduction that exposes the contradiction and completes the argument?\n\nA. The number $N$ must itself be a prime number. Since $N$ is clearly greater than $p_k$, this contradicts the assumption in S1 that $p_k$ is the largest prime.\n\nB. From S4, $N$ is not divisible by any of the primes in the set $\\{p_1, \\ldots, p_k\\}$. Therefore, $N$ has no prime factors, which directly contradicts the fundamental premise S3.\n\nC. Since $N > 1$, statement S3 guarantees that there exists some prime number, let's call it $q$, that divides $N$. Statement S4 implies that $q$ cannot be any of the primes in the set $\\{p_1, \\ldots, p_k\\}$. This shows the existence of a prime not in the supposedly complete set from S1, creating a contradiction.\n\nD. The number $N$ must be a composite number, as it is larger than the largest prime $p_k$. However, its prime factors cannot be any of $p_1, \\ldots, p_k$ according to S4, which is an absurdity.\n\nE. The construction in S2 is flawed. If the set of primes were very large, the number $N$ would exceed the capacity of standard integer types in a computer, making the argument computationally unsound and thus invalid.", "solution": "The problem requires us to identify the correct logical conclusion that completes a proof by contradiction regarding the infinitude of primes. The argument begins with the assumption (S1) that there is a finite number of primes. A valid conclusion will demonstrate that this assumption leads to a logical inconsistency. Let's analyze each option.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:** This option asserts that the constructed number $N$ must be prime. This is a common misconception in informal versions of this proof. While $N$ can be prime (e.g., if we assume primes are just $\\{2, 3\\}$, then $N = 2 \\cdot 3 + 1 = 7$, which is prime), it is not always the case. For instance, if we assume the complete set of primes is $\\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13\\}$, then $N = (2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13) + 1 = 30030 + 1 = 30031$. This number $N$ is composite, as $30031 = 59 \\times 509$. Since the proof must be universally valid, it cannot depend on a property (that $N$ is prime) which is not always true. Therefore, this option presents a flawed argument.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:** This option correctly observes from S4 that $N$ is not divisible by any prime in the set $\\{p_1, \\ldots, p_k\\}$. However, it then makes an invalid logical leap to conclude that \"Therefore, $N$ has no prime factors\". The argument has only shown that potential prime factors of $N$ cannot be from the *assumed complete set*. It has not shown that no such factors exist at all. The very goal of the proof is to show that there *must* be other prime factors outside the set. Thus, the reasoning presented in this option is fallacious.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:** This option presents a complete and logically sound deduction.\n1.  First, we establish that $N > 1$. From the construction in S2, $N$ is the product of all assumed primes plus one. Since the smallest prime is 2, the smallest possible product would be just 2 (if we assumed only one prime existed), giving $N=3$. In any case, $N > 1$.\n2.  With $N > 1$, the fundamental premise S3 applies. This guarantees that there must exist some prime number, which we can call $q$, that divides $N$.\n3.  Next, we determine the nature of this prime $q$. Statement S4 tells us that for any prime $p_i$ in our assumed complete set $\\{p_1, \\ldots, p_k\\}$, the division $N/p_i$ leaves a remainder of 1. This means that no prime $p_i$ from our set can be a divisor of $N$.\n4.  Therefore, the prime factor $q$ (whose existence is guaranteed by S3) cannot be any of the primes in the set $\\{p_1, \\ldots, p_k\\}$.\n5.  This is the contradiction. The initial assumption S1 was that the set $\\{p_1, \\ldots, p_k\\}$ contained *all* prime numbers. However, we have just proven the existence of a prime number $q$ that is not in this set. This logical contradiction proves that the initial assumption (S1) must be false. This is the correct conclusion to the proof.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:** This option suffers from a similar flaw as option A. It states that \"$N$ must be a composite number\". As we have already shown, $N$ can be either prime or composite. A robust proof cannot rely on an assertion that is not always true. The argument must work in both cases. If $N$ is prime, we have a new prime larger than $p_k$. If $N$ is composite, it must have prime factors that are not in the original list. Option C correctly captures this general logic without making the unnecessary claim that $N$ must be composite.\n\n**Analysis of Option E:** This option incorrectly brings computational limitations into a discussion of pure mathematical proof. The validity of a logical argument in number theory is an abstract concept, independent of the ability of a physical computer to handle the numbers involved. The argument deals with integers as mathematical objects, which are not bound by memory constraints. This option is a red herring.\n\nBased on this analysis, Option C is the only choice that represents a correct and complete line of reasoning to finish the proof by contradiction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1350106"}]}
