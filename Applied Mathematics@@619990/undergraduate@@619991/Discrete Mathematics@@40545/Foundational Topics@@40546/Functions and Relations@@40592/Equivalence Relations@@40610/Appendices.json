We recall the following definitions:\n*   A relation $R$ is **reflexive** if for every $x \\in X$, the pair $(x,x)$ is in $R$.\n*   A relation $R$ is **symmetric** if for all $x, y \\in X$, whenever $(x,y)$ is in $R$, then $(y,x)$ is also in $R$.\n*   A relation $R$ is **transitive** if for all $x, y, z \\in X$, whenever $(x,y)$ is in $R$ and $(y,z)$ is in $R$, then $(x,z)$ is also in $R$.\n\nAn argument is presented below, purporting to prove that any relation that is both symmetric and transitive must also be reflexive.\n\n**The Argument:**\n\"Let $R$ be a symmetric and transitive relation on a set $X$. We wish to prove that $R$ is reflexive.\n1.  Let $x$ be an arbitrary element of $X$.\n2.  Since $x \\in X$, there must exist some element $y \\in X$ such that $(x,y) \\in R$.\n3.  Because $R$ is symmetric, the fact that $(x,y) \\in R$ implies that $(y,x) \\in R$.\n4.  We now have $(x,y) \\in R$ and $(y,x) \\in R$. By the property of transitivity, we can conclude that $(x,x) \\in R$.\n5.  Since $x$ was an arbitrary element, this holds for all $x \\in X$. Thus, $R$ is reflexive.\"\n\nThis argument is flawed. Which of the following statements most accurately identifies the fundamental error in the reasoning?\n\nA. The application of transitivity in step 4 is invalid; the definition requires three distinct elements $x, y, z$, but here the third element is the same as the first.\n\nB. The argument is circular because step 2 effectively assumes that $x$ is related to some element, which is a necessary precursor to proving $(x,x) \\in R$.\n\nC. The conclusion in step 5 is an incorrect generalization; proving the property for an arbitrary element $x$ does not mean it holds for all elements.\n\nD. The argument contains a hidden, unjustified assumption in step 2: that for any given element $x \\in X$, it is guaranteed that there exists at least one element $y \\in X$ such that $(x,y) \\in R$.\n\nE. The property of symmetry requires that if $(x,y) \\in R$ then $(y,x) \\in R$ for *all* $y \\in X$, but the argument only considers one such $y$.", "solution": "We analyze the purported proof using the precise definitions:\n- Symmetry means: for all $x,y \\in X$, if $(x,y) \\in R$, then $(y,x) \\in R$.\n- Transitivity means: for all $x,y,z \\in X$, if $(x,y) \\in R$ and $(y,z) \\in R$, then $(x,z) \\in R$.\n- Reflexivity would require: for all $x \\in X$, $(x,x) \\in R$.\n\nThe argument’s step 2 asserts: since $x \\in X$, there exists $y \\in X$ with $(x,y) \\in R$. This is not a consequence of $x \\in X$, nor of symmetry or transitivity. The claimed existence would follow from the additional property that $R$ is left-total (also called serial), namely $\\forall x \\in X\\,\\exists y \\in X\\, (x,y) \\in R$, but this is not assumed. Therefore, step 2 introduces an unjustified assumption.\n\nTo underscore the error, consider a concrete counterexample: let $X$ be any non-empty set and let $R = \\emptyset$. Then for all $x,y \\in X$, the implication $(x,y) \\in R \\Rightarrow (y,x) \\in R$ holds vacuously, so $R$ is symmetric; and for all $x,y,z \\in X$, the implication $[(x,y) \\in R \\wedge (y,z) \\in R] \\Rightarrow (x,z) \\in R$ also holds vacuously, so $R$ is transitive. However, $R$ is not reflexive because for any $x \\in X$, $(x,x) \\notin R$.\n\nHence, the proof fails precisely because of the unjustified existence claim in step 2. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n- The use of transitivity in step 4 does not require $x,y,z$ to be distinct; transitivity allows $z=x$.\n- Generalizing from an arbitrary $x$ is valid if the property has been established for that $x$; the issue is that it was not established due to step 2’s flaw.\n- Symmetry does not demand anything “for all $y$” beyond the conditional statement; option E misstates the definition.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental error is the hidden assumption in step 2 that every $x$ is related by $R$ to some $y$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1551567"}, {"introduction": "Now that we have highlighted the importance of each property, let's apply our knowledge to a practical example from group theory.
