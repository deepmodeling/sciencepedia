However, it's often necessary to work backward, inferring the initial state from an observed outcome. This exercise [@problem_id:2304239] provides a hands-on way to practice this by inverting a function from a hypothetical physics model, where you must determine a particle's position from its measured potential energy. This practice sharpens your algebraic skills and reinforces the critical role of a function's domain and range in defining its inverse.", "problem": "In a theoretical physics model, the potential energy $U$ of a particle is described as a function of its radial position $r$. For a particle moving within a specific spherical region defined by $0 \\le r \\le R$, a simplified model proposes the potential energy function is given by:\n$$U(r) = U_0 - \\alpha (R-r)^2$$\nHere, $R$ is the radius of the region, while $U_0$ and $\\alpha$ are positive physical constants. The function $U(r)$ is defined on the domain $[0, R]$. For experimental analysis, it is necessary to determine the particle's position $r$ based on a measurement of its potential energy $U$.

First isolate the squared term:\n$$\nU_{0} - U = \\alpha (R - r)^{2}.\n$$\nSince $\\alpha > 0$, divide both sides by $\\alpha$:\n$$\n(R - r)^{2} = \\frac{U_{0} - U}{\\alpha}.\n$$\nTaking square roots yields\n$$\n|R - r| = \\sqrt{\\frac{U_{0} - U}{\\alpha}}.\n$$\nOn the domain $0 \\leq r \\leq R$, we have $R - r \\geq 0$, hence $|R - r| = R - r$.

This principle is fundamental to modern cryptography, where decryption is essentially the process of applying an inverse function to an encrypted message. This problem [@problem_id:1378898] gives you a practical look at this application by asking you to \"crack\" a simple affine cipher. To do so, you'll need to find the inverse of a function within the system of modular arithmetic, providing insight into how abstract algebra is used to secure information.", "problem": "In a simple cryptographic system, letters of the alphabet are represented by integers from 0 to 25, where A maps to 0, B to 1, ..., and Z maps to 25. A plaintext character, represented by its numerical value $p$, is encrypted into a ciphertext character, represented by its numerical value $c$, using an affine cipher. The specific encryption function used is:\n$$c = (5p + 1) \\pmod{26}$$\nThis means the result of $5p+1$ is divided by 26, and the remainder is taken as the value of $c$. If a particular character is encrypted and its resulting ciphertext numerical value is $c = 18$, what was the original numerical value $p$ of the plaintext character?", "solution": "Let the given encryption function be $c = E(p)$, where $p$ is the numerical value of the plaintext character and $c$ is the numerical value of the ciphertext character. The function is defined as:\n$$c \\equiv (5p + 1) \\pmod{26}$$\nOur goal is to find the value of $p$ that corresponds to a given value of $c$. We need to solve this linear congruence for $p$.\n\nFirst, we isolate the term containing $p$ by subtracting 1 from both sides of the congruence:\n$$c - 1 \\equiv 5p \\pmod{26}$$\nTo solve for $p$, we need to multiply both sides by the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 26. Let's denote this inverse as $5^{-1}$. The inverse must satisfy the property $5 \\cdot 5^{-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{26}$.\n\nWe can find this inverse using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm for $\\gcd(26, 5)$.\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n$$26 = 5 \\cdot 5 + 1$$\nSince the remainder is 1, the gcd is 1, which confirms that an inverse exists. Now, we express this remainder (1) as a linear combination of 26 and 5:\n$$1 = 26 - 5 \\cdot 5$$\n$$1 = (1) \\cdot 26 + (-5) \\cdot 5$$\nTaking this equation modulo 26, the term with 26 becomes zero:\n$$1 \\equiv (-5) \\cdot 5 \\pmod{26}$$\nThe multiplicative inverse of 5 is congruent to -5 modulo 26. To express this in the standard set of residues $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 25\\}$, we add 26:\n$$5^{-1} \\equiv -5 \\equiv -5 + 26 \\equiv 21 \\pmod{26}$$\nSo, the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 26 is 21. We can check this: $5 \\times 21 = 105$. And $105 = 4 \\times 26 + 1$, so $105 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{26}$.\n\nNow we can return to our congruence for $p$:\n$$c - 1 \\equiv 5p \\pmod{26}$$\nMultiply both sides by the inverse, which is 21:\n$$21(c - 1) \\equiv 21 \\cdot 5p \\pmod{26}$$\n$$21(c - 1) \\equiv (21 \\cdot 5)p \\pmod{26}$$\nSince $21 \\cdot 5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{26}$, the equation simplifies to:\n$$p \\equiv 21(c - 1) \\pmod{26}$$\nThis is our decryption formula.\n\nThe problem states that the ciphertext value is $c = 18$. We can substitute this value into our formula to find the original plaintext value $p$:\n$$p \\equiv 21(18 - 1) \\pmod{26}$$\n$$p \\equiv 21(17) \\pmod{26}$$\nNow we calculate the product $21 \\times 17$:\n$$21 \\times 17 = 357$$\nFinally, we find the remainder of 357 when divided by 26:\n$$357 = 26 \\times 13 + 19$$\nThe remainder is 19.
