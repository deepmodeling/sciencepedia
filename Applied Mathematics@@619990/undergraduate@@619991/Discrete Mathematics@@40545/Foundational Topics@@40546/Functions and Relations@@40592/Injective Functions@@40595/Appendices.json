To prove this, we assume $f((a, b)) = f((c, d))$ for some $(a, b), (c, d) \\in \\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N}$.\nThe assumption gives the equation $2^a 5^b = 2^c 5^d$.\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that any integer greater than 1 has a unique prime factorization. Since $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the numbers $2^a 5^b$ and $2^c 5^d$ are integers greater than 1. The equation shows two prime factorizations of the same number. By the uniqueness of this factorization, the exponents of corresponding prime factors must be equal.\nTherefore, we must have $a = c$ and $b = d$.\nThis means the original inputs must be identical, i.e., $(a, b) = (c, d)$.\nSince $f((a, b)) = f((c, d))$ implies $(a, b) = (c, d)$, the function is injective.\n\n**Option D: $f((a, b)) = (a+b)^2 + a$**\nThis function is injective.
