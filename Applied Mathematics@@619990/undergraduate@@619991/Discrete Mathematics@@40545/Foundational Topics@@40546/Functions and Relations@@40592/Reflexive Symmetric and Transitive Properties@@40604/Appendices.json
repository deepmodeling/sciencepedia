The set is $S = \\mathbb{Z}^{+}$, the set of positive integers. The relation is $a R b \\iff ab = k^2$ for some integer $k$.\n\n**1. Reflexivity**\nA relation $R$ on a set $S$ is reflexive if for every element $a \\in S$, $a R a$.\nWe need to check if $a R a$ holds for all $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+}$.\nAccording to the definition of $R$, $a R a$ means that the product $a \\cdot a$ must be a perfect square.\nThe product is $a \\cdot a = a^2$. By its very definition, $a^2$ is the square of the integer $a$. Therefore, $a^2$ is a perfect square for any integer $a$.\nSince this holds for any positive integer $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+}$, the relation $R$ is **reflexive**.\n\n**2. Symmetry**\nA relation $R$ on a set $S$ is symmetric if for every pair of elements $a, b \\in S$, if $a R b$, then $b R a$.\nWe assume $a R b$ is true and check if $b R a$ must follow.\nThe assumption $a R b$ means that the product $ab$ is a perfect square. So, $ab = k^2$ for some integer $k$.\nWe need to check if $b R a$ is true, which means we need to determine if the product $ba$ is a perfect square.\nSince multiplication of integers is commutative, $ba = ab$.\nGiven that $ab = k^2$, it follows that $ba = k^2$. Thus, $ba$ is also a perfect square.\nTherefore, if $a R b$, then $b R a$. The relation $R$ is **symmetric**.\n\n**3. Transitivity**\nA relation $R$ on a set $S$ is transitive if for every triplet of elements $a, b, c \\in S$, if $a R b$ and $b R c$, then $a R c$.\nWe assume that $a R b$ and $b R c$ are both true, and we must check if $a R c$ follows.\nThe assumption $a R b$ means $ab = k^2$ for some integer $k$.\nThe assumption $b R c$ means $bc = m^2$ for some integer $m$.\nWe need to determine if $ac$ is a perfect square.\n\nTo show this rigorously, we can use the prime factorization of the integers. Any positive integer $n$ can be uniquely written as a product of prime powers: $n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_j^{e_j}$. A number is a perfect square if and only if all the exponents $e_i$ in its prime factorization are even.\n\nLet the prime factorizations of $a, b, c$ be:\n$a = \\prod_{i=1}^{\\infty} p_i^{\\alpha_i}$\n$b = \\prod_{i=1}^{\\infty} p_i^{\\beta_i}$\n$c = \\prod_{i=1}^{\\infty} p_i^{\\gamma_i}$\nwhere $p_i$ is the $i$-th prime number and the exponents are non-negative integers.\n\nThe condition $a R b$ implies that $ab = \\prod p_i^{\\alpha_i + \\beta_i}$ is a perfect square. This means that for every prime $p_i$, the exponent $\\alpha_i + \\beta_i$ must be an even number.\n\nThe condition $b R c$ implies that $bc = \\prod p_i^{\\beta_i + \\gamma_i}$ is a perfect square. This means that for every prime $p_i$, the exponent $\\beta_i + \\gamma_i$ must be an even number.\n\nWe need to check if $a R c$, which means we need to check if $ac$ is a perfect square. This is equivalent to checking if the exponent $\\alpha_i + \\gamma_i$ is even for every prime $p_i$.\n\nFrom our assumptions:\n1. $\\alpha_i + \\beta_i = 2k_i$ for some integer $k_i$. This implies $\\alpha_i$ and $\\beta_i$ have the same parity (both are even or both are odd).\n2. $\\beta_i + \\gamma_i = 2m_i$ for some integer $m_i$. This implies $\\beta_i$ and $\\gamma_i$ have the same parity.\n\nFrom these two points, it follows that $\\alpha_i$ and $\\gamma_i$ must have the same parity.\n- If $\\beta_i$ is even, then for $\\alpha_i + \\beta_i$ to be even, $\\alpha_i$ must be even. For $\\beta_i + \\gamma_i$ to be even, $\\gamma_i$ must be even. So, $\\alpha_i$ and $\\gamma_i$ are both even.\n- If $\\beta_i$ is odd, then for $\\alpha_i + \\beta_i$ to be even, $\\alpha_i$ must be odd. For $\\beta_i + \\gamma_i$ to be even, $\\gamma_i$ must be odd. So, $\\alpha_i$ and $\\gamma_i$ are both odd.\n\nIn both cases, $\\alpha_i$ and $\\gamma_i$ have the same parity. The sum of two integers of the same parity is always an even number. Therefore, $\\alpha_i + \\gamma_i$ is even for all $i$.\n\nSince all exponents in the prime factorization of $ac$ are even, $ac$ is a perfect square. Thus, $a R c$.\nThe relation $R$ is **transitive**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe relation $R$ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. A relation with all three of these properties is known as an equivalence relation.\nComparing this result with the given options, the correct statement is G.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{G}$$", "id": "1395991"}]}
