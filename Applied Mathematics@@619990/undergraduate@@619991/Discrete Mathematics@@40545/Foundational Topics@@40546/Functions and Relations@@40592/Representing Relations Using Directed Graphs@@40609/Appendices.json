Let $S$ be the set of all possible states, which consists of all binary strings of length 3. The system can transition from a state $s_1$ to another state $s_2$ if and only if the binary strings for $s_1$ and $s_2$ differ in exactly one bit position.

The set is $S = \\{000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111\\}$. The relation is defined as $(s_1, s_2) \\in R$ if and only if the strings $s_1$ and $s_2$ differ in exactly one bit position.\n\n**Step 1: Test for Reflexivity**\nA relation $R$ on a set $S$ is reflexive if for every element $s \\in S$, the pair $(s, s)$ is in $R$.\nLet's pick an arbitrary element from $S$, for instance, $s = 010$. For $(s, s)$ to be in $R$, the string $s$ must differ from itself in exactly one position.\nHowever, any string is identical to itself, meaning it differs in zero positions. Since $0 \\neq 1$, the condition for the relation is not met. Thus, $(s, s) \\notin R$ for any $s \\in S$.\nTherefore, the relation $R$ is **not reflexive**.\nThis conclusion immediately eliminates options A and C.\n\n**Step 2: Test for Symmetry**\nA relation $R$ on a set $S$ is symmetric if for every pair of elements $s_1, s_2 \\in S$, if $(s_1, s_2) \\in R$, then $(s_2, s_1) \\in R$.\nLet's assume $(s_1, s_2) \\in R$. By the definition of $R$, this means that the binary strings $s_1$ and $s_2$ differ in exactly one bit position.\nThe property of \"differing in exactly one bit position\" is inherently symmetric. If string $s_1$ differs from string $s_2$ at a single position $i$, then it is also true that string $s_2$ differs from string $s_1$ at that same single position $i$.\nFor example, let $s_1 = 101$ and $s_2 = 111$. They differ in the second position only, so $(101, 111) \\in R$. Comparing $s_2=111$ with $s_1=101$, they also differ in the second position only, so $(111, 101) \\in R$.\nSince this holds for any pair $s_1, s_2$ that differ by one bit, we can conclude that if $(s_1, s_2) \\in R$, then $(s_2, s_1) \\in R$.\nTherefore, the relation $R$ is **symmetric**.\nThis conclusion is consistent with options A, B, and D, but we have already eliminated A. It eliminates option E.\n\n**Step 3: Test for Transitivity**\nA relation $R$ on a set $S$ is transitive if for every set of elements $s_1, s_2, s_3 \\in S$, if $(s_1, s_2) \\in R$ and $(s_2, s_3) \\in R$, then $(s_1, s_3) \\in R$.\nTo test for transitivity, we can look for a counterexample.\nLet's choose $s_1 = 000$.\nWe need to find an $s_2$ such that $(s_1, s_2) \\in R$. Let $s_2 = 100$. The strings $s_1$ and $s_2$ differ only in the first bit, so $(000, 100) \\in R$.\nNow, we need to find an $s_3$ such that $(s_2, s_3) \\in R$. To construct a potential counterexample, we should change a bit in $s_2$ that is different from the one we changed to get from $s_1$ to $s_2$. Let's change the second bit of $s_2=100$ to get $s_3 = 110$. The strings $s_2$ and $s_3$ differ only in the second bit, so $(100, 110) \\in R$.\nWe have established that $(s_1, s_2) \\in R$ and $(s_2, s_3) \\in R$ for our chosen $s_1=000, s_2=100, s_3=110$. Now we must check if $(s_1, s_3) \\in R$.\nLet's compare $s_1 = 000$ and $s_3 = 110$.\nThe first bit is different (0 vs 1).\nThe second bit is different (0 vs 1).\nThe third bit is the same (0 vs 0).\nThe strings $s_1$ and $s_3$ differ in two bit positions. Since $2 \\neq 1$, the pair $(s_1, s_3)$ is not in $R$.\nWe have found a case where $(s_1, s_2) \\in R$ and $(s_2, s_3) \\in R$, but $(s_1, s_3) \\notin R$. This is a valid counterexample.\nTherefore, the relation $R$ is **not transitive**.\nThis conclusion eliminates option B (and C, which was already eliminated).\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have determined that the relation $R$ is not reflexive, is symmetric, and is not transitive.

For $R$ restricted to a subset $S \\subseteq V$ to be an equivalence relation, it must satisfy, for all $u,v,w \\in S$: reflexivity, i.e., $(u,u) \\in E$; symmetry, i.e., if $(u,v) \\in E$ then $(v,u) \\in E$; and transitivity, i.e., if $(u,v) \\in E$ and $(v,w) \\in E$ then $(u,w) \\in E$.\n\nFirst, enforce reflexivity. Since $E$ contains $(i,i)$ for $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5,7,8\\}$ and not for $6$, any valid $S$ must be a subset of $\\{1,2,3,4,5,7,8\\}$.
