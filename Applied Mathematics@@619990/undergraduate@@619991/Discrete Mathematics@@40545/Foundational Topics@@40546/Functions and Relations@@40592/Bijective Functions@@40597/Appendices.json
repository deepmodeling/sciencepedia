The sum function $h(x) = f(x) + g(x)$ must NOT be a bijection.\n\nWe will analyze each option against these two conditions.\n\n**Option A: $f(x) = x+1, \\quad g(x) = -x+1$**\n\n1.  **Check if $f$ and $g$ are bijections.**\n    - The function $f(x) = x+1$ is a linear function with a non-zero slope of $1$. It is injective because if $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then $x_1+1 = x_2+1$, which implies $x_1=x_2$. It is surjective because for any $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we can find an $x = y-1$ such that $f(x) = (y-1)+1 = y$. Thus, $f(x)$ is a bijection.\n    - The function $g(x) = -x+1$ is a linear function with a non-zero slope of $-1$. It is injective because if $g(x_1) = g(x_2)$, then $-x_1+1 = -x_2+1$, which implies $x_1=x_2$. It is surjective because for any $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we can find an $x = 1-y$ such that $g(x) = -(1-y)+1 = y$. Thus, $g(x)$ is a bijection.\n    - Condition 1 is satisfied.\n\n2.  **Check if the sum $h(x)$ is a bijection.**\n    - The sum is $h(x) = f(x) + g(x) = (x+1) + (-x+1) = 2$.\n    - The function $h(x)=2$ is a constant function. It is not injective, as for any two distinct real numbers $x_1$ and $x_2$, $h(x_1) = 2 = h(x_2)$. It is also not surjective, as its range is $\\{2\\}$, not all of $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, $h(x)$ is not a bijection.\n    - Condition 2 is satisfied.\n\nSince both conditions are met, this pair of functions is a valid counterexample.\n\n**Option B: $f(x) = x, \\quad g(x) = x^3$**\n\n1.  **Check if $f$ and $g$ are bijections.**\n    - $f(x)=x$ is the identity function, which is a well-known bijection.\n    - $g(x)=x^3$ is a bijection. It's a strictly increasing function ($g'(x)=3x^2 \\ge 0$, and is $0$ only at $x=0$), which makes it injective. As an odd-degree polynomial, its range is $\\mathbb{R}$, making it surjective.\n    - Condition 1 is satisfied.\n\n2.  **Check if the sum $h(x)$ is a bijection.**\n    - The sum is $h(x) = x + x^3$. The derivative is $h'(x) = 1+3x^2$. Since $x^2 \\ge 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $h'(x) \\ge 1 > 0$. A strictly positive derivative implies the function is strictly increasing, which ensures it is injective. As a polynomial of odd degree, its range is $\\mathbb{R}$, so it is surjective. Therefore, $h(x)$ is a bijection.\n    - Condition 2 is not satisfied. This is not a counterexample.\n\n**Option C: $f(x) = x^2, \\quad g(x) = -x^2$**\n\n1.  **Check if $f$ and $g$ are bijections.**\n    - The function $f(x)=x^2$ is not a bijection from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. It is not injective because $f(-1) = 1 = f(1)$. It is not surjective because its range is $[0, \\infty)$, not $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    - Since $f(x)$ is not a bijection, Condition 1 is not met. We do not need to proceed further. This pair cannot be a counterexample.\n\n**Option D: $f(x) = 2x, \\quad g(x) = -x$**\n\n1.  **Check if $f$ and $g$ are bijections.**\n    - Both $f(x)=2x$ and $g(x)=-x$ are linear functions with non-zero slopes, so they are both bijections (by the same reasoning as in Option A).\n    - Condition 1 is satisfied.\n\n2.  **Check if the sum $h(x)$ is a bijection.**\n    - The sum is $h(x) = f(x)+g(x) = 2x + (-x) = x$.\n    - The function $h(x)=x$ is the identity function, which is a bijection.\n    - Condition 2 is not satisfied. This is not a counterexample.\n\n**Option E: $f(x) = \\sin(x), \\quad g(x) = x$**\n\n1.  **Check if $f$ and $g$ are bijections.**\n    - The function $f(x) = \\sin(x)$ is not a bijection from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. It is not injective because it is periodic (e.g., $\\sin(0) = \\sin(2\\pi)$). It is not surjective because its range is $[-1, 1]$, not $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    - Since $f(x)$ is not a bijection, Condition 1 is not met. This pair cannot be a counterexample.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOnly the pair of functions in Option A satisfies both criteria for a counterexample: both functions are bijections, but their sum is not.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1283997"}, {"introduction": "The concept of a bijection extends far beyond the realm of numbers, playing a vital role in computer science and data theory.

Suppose $f(s_{1})=f(s_{2})$.
