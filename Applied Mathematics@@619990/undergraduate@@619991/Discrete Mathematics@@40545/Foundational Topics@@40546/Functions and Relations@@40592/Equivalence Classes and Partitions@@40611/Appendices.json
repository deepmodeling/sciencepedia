It is a fundamental fact that equivalence relations on $X$ correspond bijectively to partitions of $X$ via the mapping that sends each equivalence relation to its set of equivalence classes, and conversely sends each partition to the relation of being in the same block. \n\nStarting from these definitions and the stated correspondence, determine the number of distinct equivalence relations on $X$ by counting the partitions of $X$ directly from first principles. Do not cite prepackaged counting formulas; justify the count by explicit case analysis based on block sizes. Your final answer must be a single integer.", "solution": "The problem requires determining the number of distinct equivalence relations on a set $X$ where the cardinality is $|X|=3$. The problem statement establishes a bijective correspondence between the set of equivalence relations on $X$ and the set of partitions of $X$. Therefore, the task reduces to counting the number of distinct partitions of the set $X$. This counting must be performed from first principles by analyzing the possible structures of the partitions.\n\nLet $X$ be a set with $3$ elements. We can represent it as $X=\\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$ without loss of generality. A partition of $X$ is a collection of non-empty, pairwise disjoint subsets of $X$, called blocks, whose union is $X$. The sum of the cardinalities of the blocks in any partition must equal the cardinality of the set $X$, which is $3$.\n\nTo systematically count all possible partitions, we can classify them by the sizes of their blocks. This corresponds to finding all integer partitions of the number $3$. An integer partition of a positive integer $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers, where the order of the addends does not matter. The integer partitions of $3$ are:\n1. $3$\n2. $2+1$\n3. $1+1+1$\n\nWe now perform a case analysis for each of these structures.\n\nCase 1: One block of size $3$.\nThis structure corresponds to the integer partition $3$. The partition must consist of a single block that contains all $3$ elements of $X$. The only such partition is $\\{\\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}\\}$. This corresponds to the trivial equivalence relation where all elements are related to each other. There is exactly $1$ partition of this type.\n\nCase 2: One block of size $2$ and one block of size $1$.\nThis structure corresponds to the integer partition $2+1$. To form a partition of this type, we need to select $2$ elements from the set $X$ to form the block of size $2$. The remaining $1$ element will automatically form the block of size $1$. The number of ways to choose $2$ elements from a set of $3$ is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{3}{2}$.\n$$ \\binom{3}{2} = \\frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = \\frac{3!}{2!1!} = \\frac{3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{(2 \\times 1) \\times 1} = 3 $$\nThe three distinct partitions are:\n- $\\{\\{x_1, x_2\\}, \\{x_3\\}\\}$\n- $\\{\\{x_1, x_3\\}, \\{x_2\\}\\}$\n- $\\{\\{x_2, x_3\\}, \\{x_1\\}\\}$\nThus, there are $3$ partitions of this type.\n\nCase 3: Three blocks of size $1$.\nThis structure corresponds to the integer partition $1+1+1$. Each block contains a single element. For the set $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$, each element must be in its own block. This results in the partition $\\{\\{x_1\\}, \\{x_2\\}, \\{x_3\\}\\}$. As a partition is a set of sets, the order of the blocks is immaterial. Therefore, there is only one way to form such a partition. This corresponds to the identity equivalence relation, where each element is related only to itself. There is exactly $1$ partition of this type.\n\nTo find the total number of partitions of $X$, we sum the counts from all possible cases.\nTotal number of partitions = (Number from Case 1) + (Number from Case 2) + (Number from Case 3).\n$$ \\text{Total} = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 $$\nBased on the bijection stated in the problem, the number of distinct equivalence relations on a set with $3$ elements is equal to the number of partitions of that set.
