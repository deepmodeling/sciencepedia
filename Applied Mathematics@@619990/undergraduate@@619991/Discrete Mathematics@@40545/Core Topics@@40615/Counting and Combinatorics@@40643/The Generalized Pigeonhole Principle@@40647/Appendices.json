This first practice problem explores a common scenario in database architecture known as sharding, where data is partitioned across multiple servers.

This exercise [@problem_id:1409193] provides a clear-cut application of the principle to predict system behavior and inform capacity planning.", "problem": "A large-scale social media platform utilizes a database sharding architecture to distribute its user data. The system consists of `S = 16` distinct database shards, indexed from 0 to 15. When a new user signs up, their account is assigned a unique, positive integer as a User ID. The system then assigns this user's data to a specific shard based on the following rule: a user with ID `U` is placed in the shard with index $I \\equiv U \\pmod S$.\n\nAn engineering team is analyzing system load. They need to determine the minimum number of new user accounts that must be created to guarantee that at least one of the shards will be responsible for storing the data of at least `C = 10` new users. What is this minimum number of new user accounts?", "solution": "We model the assignment as placing new users into $S$ shards according to $I \\equiv U \\pmod{S}$. This partitions users into $S$ residue classes modulo $S$, so analyzing the load reduces to distributing $N$ new users into $S$ shards.\n\nBy the pigeonhole principle: if $N$ items are placed into $S$ boxes, then some box contains at least $\\left\\lceil \\frac{N}{S} \\right\\rceil$ items. Equivalently, to avoid having $C$ or more in any single box, one can place at most $C-1$ in each of the $S$ boxes, for a total of\n$$\nS(C-1)\n$$\nitems. Therefore, if $N = S(C-1) + 1$, then it is guaranteed that at least one shard contains at least $C$ users.\n\nThus, the minimum number required is\n$$\nN_{\\min} = S(C-1) + 1.\n$$\nSubstituting $S = 16$ and $C = 10$,\n$$\nN_{\\min} = 16(10 - 1) + 1 = 16 \\cdot 9 + 1 = 144 + 1 = 145.\n$$\nTherefore, $145$ new user accounts are required to guarantee that at least one shard stores the data of at least $10$ new users.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{145}$$", "id": "1409193"}, {"introduction": "Real-world problems often require us to define our categories before we can apply combinatorial principles.

Only then can you apply the Generalized Pigeonhole Principle to solve a practical question in manufacturing and quality control.", "problem": "A large-scale electronics manufacturer produces Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) which are sorted into three distinct quality grades: 'Premium', 'Standard', and 'Economy'. After production, the operational lifespan of each LED is tested. The possible lifespans for these devices range from 10,000 hours to 14,999 hours, inclusive. For inventory management purposes, the recorded lifespan is always rounded down to the nearest multiple of 100 hours. For example, an LED with a tested lifespan of 12,345 hours and one with 12,389 hours are both categorized as having a 12,300-hour lifespan.\n\nA quality control manager is tasked with inspecting a massive, mixed shipment containing all three grades of LEDs. What is the minimum number of LEDs the manager must randomly draw from this shipment to absolutely guarantee that they have collected at least 25 LEDs that share both the exact same quality grade and the same categorized lifespan?", "solution": "Let the set of possible categorized lifespans be the multiples of 100 between 10000 and 14900, inclusive. This is an arithmetic progression with first term $a_{1}=10000$, last term $a_{n}=14900$, and common difference $d=100$. The number of such categories is\n$$\nn=\\frac{a_{n}-a_{1}}{d}+1=\\frac{14900-10000}{100}+1=49+1=50.\n$$\nThere are three quality grades.
