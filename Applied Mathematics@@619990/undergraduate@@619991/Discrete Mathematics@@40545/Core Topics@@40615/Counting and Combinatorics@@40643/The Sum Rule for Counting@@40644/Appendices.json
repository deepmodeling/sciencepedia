This first exercise provides a clear, real-world scenario where a larger set of possibilities is naturally partitioned into distinct, non-overlapping categories. By calculating the number of outcomes for each category separately and then adding the results, you can find the total count with confidence [@problem_id:1410901].", "problem": "A certain state's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) issues special license plates that follow one of two formats: Type-A or Type-B.

The available digits are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.\n\nA Type-A license plate consists of three letters followed by two digits. For this type, the first letter must be a vowel.

For this type, both letters must be consonants, and the first of the three digits cannot be zero.\n\nGiven these rules, how many distinct special license plates can be created? The two formats, Type-A and Type-B, represent mutually exclusive categories. Repetition of letters and digits is allowed unless a rule explicitly states otherwise.", "solution": "We apply basic counting rules: the rule of product (multiply independent choices) and the rule of sum (add counts from mutually exclusive cases).
