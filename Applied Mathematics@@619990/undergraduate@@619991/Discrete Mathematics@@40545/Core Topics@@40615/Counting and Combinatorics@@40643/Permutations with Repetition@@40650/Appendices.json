This is a problem of counting the number of distinguishable permutations of a multiset.\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of atoms in the molecule, which corresponds to the total number of positions in the linear sequence. Let this be $n$.\nThe counts for each type of atom are:\n- Carbon (C): $n_C = 8$\n- Hydrogen (H): $n_H = 12$\n- Nitrogen (N): $n_N = 4$\n- Silicon (Si): $n_{Si} = 2$\n\nThe total number of atoms is the sum of the counts of each element:\n$$ n = n_C + n_H + n_N + n_{Si} = 8 + 12 + 4 + 2 = 26 $$\n\nThe number of distinct permutations of $n$ objects, where there are $k$ distinct types of objects with counts $n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_k$ respectively, is given by the multinomial coefficient formula:\n$$ N = \\frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! \\cdots n_k!} $$\n\nIn our case, this translates to:\n$$ N = \\frac{26!}{8! \\cdot 12! \\cdot 4! \\cdot 2!} $$\n\nTo compute this value, we can expand the factorials and simplify. We can start by expanding the largest factorial in the numerator, $26!$, until we reach the largest factorial in the denominator, $12!$:\n$$ N = \\frac{26 \\times 25 \\times 24 \\times 23 \\times 22 \\times 21 \\times 20 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\times 17 \\times 16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12!}{8! \\cdot 12! \\cdot 4! \\cdot 2!} $$\n\nWe can cancel the $12!$ terms:\n$$ N = \\frac{26 \\times 25 \\times 24 \\times 23 \\times 22 \\times 21 \\times 20 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\times 17 \\times 16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times 13}{8! \\cdot 4! \\cdot 2!} $$\n\nNow, let's evaluate the remaining factorials in the denominator: $4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24$ and $2! = 2 \\times 1 = 2$.\n$$ N = \\frac{26 \\times 25 \\times 24 \\times 23 \\times 22 \\times 21 \\times 20 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\times 17 \\times 16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times 13}{8! \\cdot 24 \\cdot 2} $$\nThe $24$ in the numerator cancels with the $4! = 24$ in the denominator:\n$$ N = \\frac{26 \\times 25 \\times 23 \\times 22 \\times 21 \\times 20 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\times 17 \\times 16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times 13}{8! \\cdot 2} $$\n\nTo simplify further without a calculator for large numbers, we can look for helpful combinations.
