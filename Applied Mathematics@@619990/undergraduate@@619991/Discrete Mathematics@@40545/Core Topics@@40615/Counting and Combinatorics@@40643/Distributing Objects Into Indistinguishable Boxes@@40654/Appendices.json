This problem [@problem_id:1365865] asks us to partition a set of $n$ distinct items into $n-1$ indistinguishable groups. By thinking through the structure of such a partition, you will discover a direct and elegant connection between the Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted $S(n, k)$, and the familiar binomial coefficients, providing a solid anchor for understanding more complex scenarios.", "problem": "A university research committee is reviewing $n$ distinct grant proposals for a new funding initiative. The committee has decided to form exactly $n-1$ new, indistinguishable research collaborations to carry out the projects. Every proposal must be assigned to a collaboration, and every collaboration must be assigned at least one proposal. Find a closed-form analytic expression for the total number of ways the committee can assign the $n$ proposals to the $n-1$ collaborations, in terms of $n$, assuming $n \\ge 2$.", "solution": "We are assigning $n$ distinct proposals to exactly $n-1$ collaborations that are indistinguishable, with each collaboration nonempty. This is the number of set partitions of an $n$-element set into exactly $n-1$ nonempty unlabeled blocks, which equals $S(n,n-1)$, the Stirling number of the second kind.\n\nLet the block sizes be $s_{1},\\dots,s_{n-1}$ with each $s_{i}\\ge 1$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} s_{i}=n$.
