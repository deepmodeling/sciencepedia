The total number of analysts is $20$, partitioned into $5$ Cryptography specialists and $15$ non-Cryptography specialists (Network Security and Application Security combined).\n\nWe require teams of size $4$ with at least one Cryptography specialist.

The federation is composed of 10 member species, whose representatives are seated at a large circular table for diplomatic proceedings. The council will consist of 3 distinct representatives. To ensure a balance of power and to avoid a perception of collusion, a rule is established: no two representatives chosen for the council can be from species that were seated next to each other at the table. How many different councils of 3 can be formed under this rule?", "solution": "We label the 10 seated species as vertices $1,2,\\dots,10$ around a circle. We seek the number of $3$-subsets of $\\{1,\\dots,10\\}$ with no two adjacent on the circle; in particular, $\\{1,10\\}$ is also forbidden as adjacent.\n\nFirst convert to a linear problem and correct for the circular wrap-around. Consider the path $1,2,\\dots,10$ (a line). The number of $3$-subsets with no consecutive integers in a line of length $n$ is given by\n$$\n\\binom{n - 3 + 1}{3}=\\binom{n - 2}{3},\n$$\nwhich for $n=10$ becomes\n$$\n\\binom{8}{3}.\n$$\nThis formula follows from the standard bijection: if $1 \\leq a_{1}  a_{2}  a_{3} \\leq n$ with $a_{i+1} \\geq a_{i} + 2$ (no consecutive), define $b_{i} = a_{i} - (i - 1)$. Then $1 \\leq b_{1}  b_{2}  b_{3} \\leq n - 2$, and conversely $a_{i} = b_{i} + (i - 1)$, establishing a bijection with $3$-subsets of $\\{1,\\dots,n-2\\}$, counted by $\\binom{n-2}{3}$.\n\nThus the linear count for $n=10$ is\n$$\n\\binom{8}{3} = 56.\n$$\n\nNow adjust for the circular adjacency between $1$ and $10$. Among these $56$, subtract those subsets that contain both $1$ and $10$, since they are adjacent on the circle. If $1$ and $10$ are included, the remaining third element must avoid adjacency with $1$ and $10$, so it cannot be $2$ or $9$, and there is no other adjacency to consider because it is the only additional chosen element. Hence it can be any one of $\\{3,4,5,6,7,8\\}$, giving\n$$\n6\n$$\nsuch subsets.\n\nTherefore, the number of valid $3$-member councils on the circle is\n$$\n\\binom{8}{3} - 6 = 56 - 6 = 50.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{50}$$", "id": "1356216"}, {"introduction": "Real-world scenarios rarely involve a single, simple rule; they often feature multiple, overlapping constraints.
