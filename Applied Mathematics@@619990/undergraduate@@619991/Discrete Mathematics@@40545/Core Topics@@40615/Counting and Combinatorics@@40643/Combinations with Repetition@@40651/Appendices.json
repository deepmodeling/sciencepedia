For a particular sample, a total of 10 atoms must be chosen to be added as dopants to a crystal lattice. The scientist has an unlimited supply of 4 different types of dopant elements, let's call them Type 1, Type 2, Type 3, and Type 4. The properties of the resulting alloy depend only on the total count of each type of dopant atom in the sample, not on the order in which they are added or their specific positions in the lattice.
