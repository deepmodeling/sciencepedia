The sequence is defined as follows:\nLet $a_1 = 1$, $a_2 = 1$, and for all integers $n \\ge 3$, let $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$.\n\nThe student makes the following claim: \"All terms $a_n$ in this sequence are odd.\"\n\nTo support this claim, the student presents an argument that uses the Well-Ordering Principle. However, the argument is flawed. Read the argument carefully and identify the step that contains the logical error.\n\n**The Student's Argument:**\n\n*   **Step A:** I will use a proof by contradiction. Assume the claim is false. This means there is at least one term in the sequence that is even. Let $S$ be the set of all positive integers $n$ for which the term $a_n$ is even. According to my assumption, the set $S$ is non-empty.\n\n*   **Step B:** The Well-Ordering Principle states that every non-empty set of positive integers contains a least element. Since $S$ is a non-empty set of positive integers, it must have a least element. Let's call this least element $k$.\n\n*   **Step C:** By the definition of the sequence, $a_1 = 1$ (odd) and $a_2 = 1$ (odd). This means that $1$ is not in $S$ and $2$ is not in $S$. Therefore, the least element $k$ from Step B must be greater than 2, so $k \\ge 3$.\n\n*   **Step D:** Since $k \\ge 3$, we can use the recursive definition for $a_k$, which is $a_k = a_{k-1} + a_{k-2}$. Because $k$ is the *least* integer in $S$, the integers $k-1$ and $k-2$ are positive integers that are not in $S$. By the definition of $S$, this implies that both $a_{k-1}$ and $a_{k-2}$ must be odd.\n\n*   **Step E:** The sum of two odd integers is always an even integer. Since $a_{k-1}$ and $a_{k-2}$ are both odd, their sum, $a_k$, must be even. This contradicts the initial makeup of the sequence where the odd base terms can only generate other odd terms. This contradiction shows that my initial assumption in Step A must be false. Therefore, the set $S$ must be empty, and all terms in the sequence are odd.\n\nWhich step in the argument contains the fundamental logical flaw?\n\nA. Step A: The initial assumption is set up incorrectly for a proof by contradiction.\nB. Step B: The Well-Ordering Principle cannot be applied to the set $S$ because $S$ could potentially be an infinite set.\nC. Step D: The conclusion that $a_{k-1}$ and $a_{k-2}$ must be odd is not necessarily true.\nD. Step E: The argument fabricates a contradiction where none has been logically derived from the preceding steps.", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify the flaw in a student's proof that all terms of the sequence $a_1=1, a_2=1, a_n=a_{n-1}+a_{n-2}$ are odd. Let's analyze each step of the student's argument.\n\n**Analysis of Step A:**\nThe student assumes the claim is false, which is the standard first step for a proof by contradiction. The set $S = \\{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+ \\mid a_n \\text{ is even}\\}$ is correctly defined as the set of counterexamples. If the claim is false, $S$ must be non-empty. This step is logically sound. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Step B:**\nThe Well-Ordering Principle states that *any* non-empty subset of the positive integers has a least element. It does not matter if the set is finite or infinite. Since $S$ is defined as a non-empty set of positive integers, the principle can be validly applied. This step is logically sound. Thus, option B is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Step C:**\nThe argument correctly evaluates the first two terms of the sequence: $a_1=1$ and $a_2=1$. Both are odd. This correctly implies that the indices $1$ and $2$ are not in the set $S$. If $S$ contains a least element $k$, and $k$ is not $1$ and not $2$, then $k$ must be an integer greater than $2$ (i.e., $k \\ge 3$). This step is logically sound.\n\n**Analysis of Step D:**\nThis step uses the fact that $k$ is the *least* element of $S$. If $k$ is the smallest integer such that $a_k$ is even, then for any positive integer $m  k$, $a_m$ must be odd. Since Step C established that $k \\ge 3$, both $k-1$ and $k-2$ are positive integers that are less than $k$. Therefore, $k-1 \\notin S$ and $k-2 \\notin S$. This means $a_{k-1}$ and $a_{k-2}$ must be odd. This step is logically sound. Thus, option C is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Step E:**\nThis step begins by correctly stating a truth of arithmetic: the sum of two odd numbers is even. Based on Step D, where $a_{k-1}$ and $a_{k-2}$ were shown to be odd, it correctly concludes that $a_k = a_{k-1} + a_{k-2}$ must be even.\nAt this point, the argument has shown that the assumption (that a first even term $a_k$ exists) leads to the conclusion that $a_k$ is generated by the sum of the two preceding odd terms. This is a consistent line of reasoning, not a contradiction. For example, if we check the actual sequence ($1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...$), the first even term is $a_3=2$. Here, $k=3$. The preceding terms are $a_2=1$ and $a_1=1$, which are both odd. The logic of steps A through D perfectly describes how $a_3$ is generated.\nThe flaw occurs when the student claims a contradiction. The argument states: \"This contradicts the initial makeup of the sequence where the odd base terms can only generate other odd terms.\" This is the error. There is no \"fundamental property\" or \"initial makeup\" that has been established stating that odd terms must generate odd terms. In fact, the argument itself has just proven the opposite: two consecutive odd terms *will* generate an even term. The student invents a contradiction from an unproven assertion, ignoring the actual logical consequence of their own argument. The argument did not reach a logical impasse; it simply failed to find a contradiction, which is the correct outcome because the original claim is false. Step E misinterprets this failure as a successful contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental logical flaw is in Step E, where a contradiction is declared without being properly derived.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1411696"}, {"introduction": "The Well-ordering Principle is not just for abstract proofs; it has tangible consequences in computer science, guaranteeing that certain algorithms will terminate.
