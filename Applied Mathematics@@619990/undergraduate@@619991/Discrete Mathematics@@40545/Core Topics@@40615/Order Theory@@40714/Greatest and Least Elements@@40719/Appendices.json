Since by definition the empty string $\\epsilon$ is a prefix of every string, it follows that\n$$\n\\forall s\\in S,\\quad \\epsilon \\preceq s.\n$$\nHence $\\epsilon$ is a least element. No nonempty string can be least because if $x\\in S$ has positive length, then $x\\npreceq \\epsilon$ (a nonempty string is not a prefix of the empty string), so it fails the criterion $\\forall s\\in S,\\ x\\preceq s$.

This is a partial order since, in particular, antisymmetry holds: if $a \\preccurlyeq b$ and $b \\preccurlyeq a$ and $a \\ne b$, then $2a \\le b$ and $2b \\le a$, which imply $4a \\le a$, hence $3a \\le 0$, impossible for $a \\in S$. Therefore $a=b$.\n\nTo find a least element, we need $l \\in S$ such that $l \\preccurlyeq b$ for all $b \\in S$. Take $l=1$. For any $b \\in S$, if $b=1$ then $1 \\preccurlyeq 1$; if $b \\ge 2$, then $2 \\le b$, so $2\\cdot 1 \\le b$ and hence $1 \\preccurlyeq b$. Thus $1$ is a least element.\n\nTo check for a greatest element $g$, we would need $a \\preccurlyeq g$ for all $a \\in S$. In particular, for $a=11$ we need $11 \\preccurlyeq g$, which requires either $g=11$ or $22 \\le g$, but $22 \\le g$ is impossible in $S$. Hence $g=11$ is forced. For $a=12$, we need $12 \\preccurlyeq g$, requiring $g=12$ or $24 \\le g$, so $g=12$ is forced. It is impossible for a single $g$ to equal both $11$ and $12$, hence no greatest element exists.\n\nAn element $m$ is minimal if there is no $x \\in S$ with $x \\ne m$ and $x \\preccurlyeq m$. If $m \\ge 2$, then $x=1$ satisfies $2x=2 \\le m$, hence $1 \\preccurlyeq m$, so $m$ is not minimal. For $m=1$, the only $x$ with $x \\preccurlyeq 1$ is $x=1$ itself, since $2x \\le 1$ has no solution in $S$. Therefore the set of minimal elements is $\\{1\\}$.\n\nAn element $m$ is maximal if there is no $y \\in S$ with $y \\ne m$ and $m \\preccurlyeq y$. If $2m \\le 20$, then taking $y=2m$ gives $m \\preccurlyeq y$ with $y \\ne m$, so $m$ is not maximal. Thus $m$ is maximal if and only if $2m>20$, i.e., $m \\ge 11$. Therefore the set of maximal elements is $\\{11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20\\}$.\n\nCombining these, the correct description is: least element $1$, no greatest element, minimal elements $\\{1\\}$, maximal elements $\\{11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20\\}$, which matches option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1372444"}]}
