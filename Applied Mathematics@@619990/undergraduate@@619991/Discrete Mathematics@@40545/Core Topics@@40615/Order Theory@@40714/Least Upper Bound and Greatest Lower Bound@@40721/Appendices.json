{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The concepts of greatest lower bound (glb) and least upper bound (lub) can feel abstract, but they often correspond to familiar ideas in specific contexts. This first exercise grounds these concepts in number theory, using a set of integers ordered by the divisibility relation. You will discover how, in this particular partially ordered set, finding the glb and lub of a subset of numbers is equivalent to calculating their greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM), respectively [@problem_id:1381061].", "problem": "Consider the set $S$ of all positive integers that can be expressed in the form $2^a 3^b$, where $a$ and $b$ are non-negative integers. This set $S$ forms a partially ordered set (poset) under the relation of divisibility. We say that for two elements $x, y \\in S$, $x \\le y$ if and only if $x$ divides $y$.\n\nWithin this poset $(S, \\le)$, consider the subset $A = \\{12, 18\\}$. Your task is to find the greatest lower bound (glb), also known as the infimum, and the least upper bound (lub), also known as the supremum, of the subset $A$.\n\nYour final answer should be a row matrix containing two integers: the greatest lower bound and the least upper bound, in that order.", "solution": "First, we must express the elements of the subset $A = \\{12, 18\\}$ in the form $2^a 3^b$ to confirm they belong to the set $S$.\nThe prime factorization of 12 is $2^2 \\cdot 3^1$. Here, $a=2$ and $b=1$, which are non-negative integers. So, $12 \\in S$.\nThe prime factorization of 18 is $2^1 \\cdot 3^2$. Here, $a=1$ and $b=2$, which are non-negative integers. So, $18 \\in S$.\n\nNext, we determine the greatest lower bound (glb) of $A$.\nBy definition, a lower bound of $A$ is an element $g \\in S$ such that for every element $x \\in A$, we have $g \\le x$. In the context of the divisibility relation, this means $g$ must divide every element in $A$. So, a lower bound must divide both 12 and 18. The set of lower bounds for $A$ is the set of common divisors of 12 and 18 that are also in $S$.\nThe greatest lower bound (glb) is a lower bound that is \"greater\" than all other lower bounds. In this poset, this means the glb is a common divisor that is divisible by every other common divisor. For the set of integers ordered by divisibility, this corresponds to the greatest common divisor (GCD).\n\nWe compute the GCD of 12 and 18.\n$\\text{gcd}(12, 18) = \\text{gcd}(2^2 \\cdot 3^1, 2^1 \\cdot 3^2)$\nTo find the GCD, we take the minimum power for each common prime factor.\n$\\text{gcd}(12, 18) = 2^{\\min(2, 1)} \\cdot 3^{\\min(1, 2)} = 2^1 \\cdot 3^1 = 6$.\nWe must check if this result, 6, is in the set $S$. Since $6 = 2^1 3^1$, it fits the form $2^a 3^b$ with $a=1, b=1$. Thus, the glb of $\\{12, 18\\}$ is 6.\n\nNow, we determine the least upper bound (lub) of $A$.\nBy definition, an upper bound of $A$ is an element $l \\in S$ such that for every element $x \\in A$, we have $x \\le l$. In the context of the divisibility relation, this means every element in $A$ must divide $l$. So, an upper bound must be a multiple of both 12 and 18. The set of upper bounds for $A$ is the set of common multiples of 12 and 18 that are also in $S$.\nThe least upper bound (lub) is an upper bound that is \"less\" than all other upper bounds. In this poset, this means the lub is a common multiple that divides every other common multiple. For the set of integers ordered by divisibility, this corresponds to the least common multiple (LCM).\n\nWe compute the LCM of 12 and 18.\n$\\text{lcm}(12, 18) = \\text{lcm}(2^2 \\cdot 3^1, 2^1 \\cdot 3^2)$\nTo find the LCM, we take the maximum power for each prime factor present.\n$\\text{lcm}(12, 18) = 2^{\\max(2, 1)} \\cdot 3^{\\max(1, 2)} = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 = 4 \\cdot 9 = 36$.\nWe must check if this result, 36, is in the set $S$. Since $36 = 2^2 3^2$, it fits the form $2^a 3^b$ with $a=2, b=2$. Thus, the lub of $\\{12, 18\\}$ is 36.\n\nThe problem asks for the greatest lower bound and the least upper bound, in that order.\nThe glb is 6.\nThe lub is 36.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 6 & 36 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1381061"}, {"introduction": "Moving from numbers to a domain central to computer science, this practice explores a poset formed by binary strings under the prefix relation. This is an intuitive partial order where one string is 'less than' another if it forms the beginning of that other string.

We define a partial order on this set using the prefix relation, denoted by $\\preceq$. For any two strings $u, v \\in B$, we say that $u \\preceq v$ if and only if $u$ is a prefix of $v$.

The set for which we need to find the greatest lower bound (glb) is $S = \\{\"1100\", \"1101\", \"111\"\\}$.\n\nFirst, we must identify the set of all lower bounds of $S$. A string $l \\in B$ is a lower bound of $S$ if it is a prefix of every element in $S$. That is, $l$ must be a prefix of \"1100\", \"1101\", and \"111\" simultaneously.\n\nLet's list the non-empty prefixes for each string in $S$:\n- Prefixes of \"1100\": $\\{\"1\", \"11\", \"110\", \"1100\"\\}$\n- Prefixes of \"1101\": $\\{\"1\", \"11\", \"110\", \"1101\"\\}$\n- Prefixes of \"111\": $\\{\"1\", \"11\", \"111\"\\}$\n\nThe set of common prefixes is the intersection of these three sets of prefixes.\nCommon Prefixes = $\\{\"1\", \"11\", \"110\", \"1100\"\\} \\cap \\{\"1\", \"11\", \"110\", \"1101\"\\} \\cap \\{\"1\", \"11\", \"111\"\\}$\n\nLet's perform the intersection step-by-step.\nThe intersection of the first two sets is:\n$\\{\"1\", \"11\", \"110\", \"1100\"\\} \\cap \\{\"1\", \"11\", \"110\", \"1101\"\\} = \\{\"1\", \"11\", \"110\"\\}$\n\nNow, we intersect this result with the prefixes of the third string:\n$\\{\"1\", \"11\", \"110\"\\} \\cap \\{\"1\", \"11\", \"111\"\\} = \\{\"1\", \"11\"\\}$\n\nSo, the set of all lower bounds for $S$ is $L = \\{\"1\", \"11\"\\}$.\n\nNext, we must find the *greatest* lower bound from this set $L$. The greatest lower bound is the element $g \\in L$ such that for any other lower bound $l \\in L$, we have $l \\preceq g$. In the context of the prefix relation, this means the greatest lower bound is the *longest* string in the set of lower bounds, as any shorter prefix in the set will be a prefix of the longer one.\n\nThe elements of $L$ are \"1\" and \"11\". We check the prefix relation between them:\n- Is \"1\" $\\preceq$ \"11\"? Yes, because \"1\" is a prefix of \"11\".\n- Is \"11\" $\\preceq$ \"1\"? No.\n\nSince \"1\" $\\preceq$ \"11\", the string \"11\" is the \"greater\" element in the set of lower bounds $L$ according to the partial order $\\preceq$.
