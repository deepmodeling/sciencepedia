A partial order $\\preceq$ is defined on the set $S_8$. For any two strings $x = x_1x_2...x_8$ and $y = y_1y_2...y_8$ in $S_8$, we say that $x \\preceq y$ if and only if $x_i \\le y_i$ for all integers $i$ from 1 to 8.\n\nAn antichain in a partially ordered set is a subset of elements where no two distinct elements are comparable. That is, for any two distinct elements $a$ and $b$ in the antichain, neither $a \\preceq b$ nor $b \\preceq a$ is true.\n\nDetermine the size of the largest possible antichain in the partially ordered set $(S_8, \\preceq)$.", "solution": "Let $(S_8, \\preceq)$ be the partially ordered set as described in the problem statement. The elements of $S_8$ are binary strings of length 8 with no two consecutive '1's. The relation $\\preceq$ is the bitwise order. We are looking for the size of the largest antichain in this poset.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the comparability condition. If a string $x$ is comparable to a string $y$ with $x \\neq y$ and $x \\preceq y$, it means $x_i \\le y_i$ for all $i$, and there must be at least one index $j$ where $x_j < y_j$. This implies $x_j=0$ and $y_j=1$. Let $w(s)$ denote the Hamming weight of a string $s$, which is the number of '1's in it. The condition $x_j=0, y_j=1$ strictly increases the Hamming weight, so if $x \\preceq y$ and $x \\neq y$, it must be that $w(x) < w(y)$.\n\nA direct consequence of this is that if two distinct strings $x$ and $y$ have the same Hamming weight, $w(x) = w(y)$, they cannot be comparable. If they were, say $x \\preceq y$, it would imply $w(x) < w(y)$, a contradiction. Therefore, any set of strings in $S_8$ that all have the same Hamming weight forms an antichain.\n\nThis suggests a strategy to find a large antichain: we can partition $S_8$ into subsets based on Hamming weight and find the size of the largest such subset. Let $N_k$ be the set of strings in $S_8$ with Hamming weight $k$. Each $N_k$ is an antichain, and its size is the number of binary strings of length 8 with exactly $k$ ones and no consecutive ones.\n\nWe can find the size of $N_k$ using a combinatorial argument. Consider placing $k$ ones in 8 available positions. The constraint is that no two ones can be adjacent. This is a classic stars-and-bars type problem. Imagine we have $8-k$ zeros (the \"bars\") which create $ (8-k)+1 = 9-k $ slots where the $k$ ones (the \"stars\") can be placed (including before the first zero and after the last zero). To ensure no two ones are consecutive, we must place at most one '1' in each slot. Thus, we need to choose $k$ of these $9-k$ available slots. The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{9-k}{k}$.\n\nNow we calculate $|N_k| = \\binom{9-k}{k}$ for all possible values of $k$. The number of ones, $k$, can range from 0. The maximum number of ones in a string of length 8 with no consecutive ones is 4 (e.g., the string 10101010). So, we need to check $k=0, 1, 2, 3, 4$.\n\nFor $k=0$:\n$|N_0| = \\binom{9-0}{0} = \\binom{9}{0} = 1$. (The string is 00000000).\n\nFor $k=1$:\n$|N_1| = \\binom{9-1}{1} = \\binom{8}{1} = 8$.\n\nFor $k=2$:\n$|N_2| = \\binom{9-2}{2} = \\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21$.\n\nFor $k=3$:\n$|N_3| = \\binom{9-3}{3} = \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20$.\n\nFor $k=4$:\n$|N_4| = \\binom{9-4}{4} = \\binom{5}{4} = 5$.\n\nFor $k \\ge 5$, the formula gives $\\binom{9-k}{k}=0$, as expected since we cannot place 5 or more non-adjacent ones in 8 spots.\n\nThe sizes of these antichains $N_k$ are 1, 8, 21, 20, and 5. The maximum of these values is 21.\n\nThis poset is a graded poset where the rank function is the Hamming weight. For many such posets, including this one (which has the Sperner property), the size of the largest antichain is equal to the size of the largest rank level. We have found that the largest rank level is $N_2$, with size 21.\n\nTherefore, the size of the largest possible antichain in $(S_8, \\preceq)$ is 21.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{21}$$", "id": "1357398"}]}
