A relation $\\mathcal{R}$ is defined on this set. For any two points $P_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $P_2 = (x_2, y_2)$ in $S$, we say that $P_1$ is related to $P_2$, written as $P_1 \\mathcal{R} P_2$, if and only if the squared Euclidean distance of $P_1$ from the origin is less than or equal to that of $P_2$.

Hence $\\mathcal{R}$ is reflexive.\n\nAntisymmetry: Antisymmetry requires that if $P_{1} \\mathcal{R} P_{2}$ and $P_{2} \\mathcal{R} P_{1}$, then $P_{1}=P_{2}$. Let $a$ be any real number with $a \\ne 0$, and consider $P_{1}=(a,0)$ and $P_{2}=(0,a)$.

Since for any $r_{1},r_{2}\\in \\mathbb{R}$ we have $r_{1} \\le r_{2}$ or $r_{2} \\le r_{1}$, it follows that for any $P_{1},P_{2}$, either $P_{1} \\mathcal{R} P_{2}$ or $P_{2} \\mathcal{R} P_{1}$.
