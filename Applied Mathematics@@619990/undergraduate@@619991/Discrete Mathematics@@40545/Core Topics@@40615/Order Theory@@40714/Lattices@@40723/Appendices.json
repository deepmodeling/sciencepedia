Each switch can be either in the OFF state, represented by the integer 0, or the ON state, represented by the integer 1. The overall state of the control panel is described by an ordered pair $(s_1, s_2)$, where $s_1$ is the state of Switch 1 and $s_2$ is the state of Switch 2.\n\nA state $A = (a_1, a_2)$ is defined as a \"precursor\" to a state $B = (b_1, b_2)$ if one can transition from $A$ to $B$ by only flipping switches from OFF to ON. In other words, a switch that is already ON cannot be flipped to OFF during this progression. We denote this relationship by $A \\preceq B$.\n\nFurthermore, we define a state $B$ to be an \"immediate successor\" of a state $A$ if $A$ is a precursor to $B$ ($A \\preceq B$), $A$ is not equal to $B$, and there exists no distinct state $C$ (where $C \\ne A$ and $C \\ne B$) such that $A$ is a precursor to $C$ and $C$ is a precursor to $B$.\n\nWhich of the following sets correctly and completely lists all pairs of states $(A, B)$ such that $B$ is an immediate successor of $A$?\n\nA. $\\{((0,0), (1,0)), ((0,0), (0,1)), ((1,0), (1,1)), ((0,1), (1,1))\\}$\n\nB. $\\{((0,0), (1,0)), ((0,0), (0,1)), ((0,0), (1,1))\\}$\n\nC. $\\{((0,0), (1,1)), ((1,0), (0,1))\\}$\n\nD. $\\{((0,0), (1,0)), ((0,0), (0,1)), ((1,0), (1,1)), ((0,1), (1,1)), ((0,0), (1,1))\\}$\n\nE. $\\{((1,0), (0,0)), ((0,1), (0,0)), ((1,1), (1,0)), ((1,1), (0,1))\\}$", "solution": "Let the set of states of the control panel be $S$. Since each of the two switches can be in one of two states (0 or 1), the total number of states is $2 \\times 2 = 4$. The set of states is:\n$S = \\{(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1)\\}$.\n\nThe \"precursor\" relationship $A \\preceq B$ for two states $A = (a_1, a_2)$ and $B = (b_1, b_2)$ is defined as being able to go from $A$ to $B$ by only flipping switches from OFF (0) to ON (1). This means that for each switch, its state in $B$ must be greater than or equal to its state in $A$. Mathematically, this translates to:\n$(a_1, a_2) \\preceq (b_1, b_2)$ if and only if $a_1 \\le b_1$ and $a_2 \\le b_2$.\nThis defines a partial order on the set of states $S$.\n\nThe problem asks for all pairs $(A, B)$ where $B$ is an \"immediate successor\" of $A$. According to the definition, this means:\n1. $A \\preceq B$\n2. $A \\ne B$ (which can be combined with the first condition to write $A \\prec B$)\n3. There is no state $C$ such that $A \\prec C \\prec B$.\n\nThis is the definition of the covering relation in a partially ordered set. We need to find all pairs $(A, B)$ such that $B$ covers $A$. We can do this by systematically checking all possible pairs of distinct states.\n\nLet's denote the states for clarity:\n$S_A = (0,0)$\n$S_B = (1,0)$\n$S_C = (0,1)$\n$S_D = (1,1)$\n\nWe can analyze the relationship between pairs of states $(X, Y)$ where $X \\ne Y$:\n\n1.  **Pairs involving $S_A = (0,0)$ as the precursor:**\n    -   Is $S_B = (1,0)$ an immediate successor of $S_A$?\n        We have $(0,0) \\preceq (1,0)$ because $0 \\le 1$ and $0 \\le 0$. They are not equal. We need to check if a state $C=(c_1, c_2)$ exists such that $(0,0) \\prec (c_1, c_2) \\prec (1,0)$. This would mean $0 \\le c_1 \\le 1$, $0 \\le c_2 \\le 0$, and $C$ must be different from $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$. The condition on the second component implies $c_2 = 0$. The condition on the first component, combined with $C \\ne (0,0)$ and $C \\ne (1,0)$, is impossible as $c_1$ must be an integer. Thus, no such intermediate state $C$ exists. So, $((0,0), (1,0))$ is a valid pair.\n    -   Is $S_C = (0,1)$ an immediate successor of $S_A$?\n        By symmetry with the previous case, $(0,0) \\preceq (0,1)$, and there is no intermediate state. So, $((0,0), (0,1))$ is a valid pair.\n    -   Is $S_D = (1,1)$ an immediate successor of $S_A$?\n        We have $(0,0) \\preceq (1,1)$ since $0 \\le 1$ and $0 \\le 1$. But we can find an intermediate state. For example, let $C = S_B = (1,0)$. We have $(0,0) \\prec (1,0)$ and $(1,0) \\prec (1,1)$. So, $(0,0) \\prec (1,0) \\prec (1,1)$. Since an intermediate state exists, $S_D$ is not an immediate successor of $S_A$.\n\n2.  **Pairs involving $S_B = (1,0)$ as the precursor:**\n    -   Is $S_C = (0,1)$ a successor? No, because $1 \\not\\le 0$, so $(1,0) \\not\\preceq (0,1)$. These states are incomparable.\n    -   Is $S_D = (1,1)$ an immediate successor of $S_B$?\n        We have $(1,0) \\preceq (1,1)$ because $1 \\le 1$ and $0 \\le 1$. We check for an intermediate state $C=(c_1, c_2)$ such that $(1,0) \\prec (c_1, c_2) \\prec (1,1)$. This requires $1 \\le c_1 \\le 1$ and $0 \\le c_2 \\le 1$. The first part implies $c_1 = 1$. The non-equality requires $C \\ne (1,0)$ and $C \\ne (1,1)$, which is impossible for an integer $c_2$. No intermediate state exists. So, $((1,0), (1,1))$ is a valid pair.\n\n3.  **Pairs involving $S_C = (0,1)$ as the precursor:**\n    -   Is $S_D = (1,1)$ an immediate successor of $S_C$?\n        By symmetry with the case of $S_B$, we have $(0,1) \\preceq (1,1)$, and there is no intermediate state.
