{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A key feature of partially ordered sets (posets) is that we can analyze relationships within subsets of elements, even if the entire set is not linearly ordered. This first practice challenges you to apply the fundamental definitions of upper bounds and the least upper bound (supremum) to a concrete subset. Mastering these concepts by working with the familiar poset of integer divisors provides a solid foundation for understanding more complex lattice structures [@problem_id:1389463].", "problem": "Let $D_{72}$ be the set of all positive integer divisors of 72. A partially ordered set (poset) is formed by $(D_{72}, |)$, where the relation `|` denotes divisibility (i.e., for $x, y \\in D_{72}$, we say $x \\le y$ in this poset if $x | y$).\n\nConsider the subset $S = \\{6, 8\\}$ of $D_{72}$.

The divisors of 72 are:\n$$ D_{72} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72\\} $$\nThe poset is $(D_{72}, |)$, where $|$ is the divisibility relation. The subset in question is $S = \\{6, 8\\}$.\n\n**Step 1: Find the set of all upper bounds of S.**\n\nAn element $u \\in D_{72}$ is an upper bound for the subset $S$ if for every element $s \\in S$, we have $s | u$. In this case, an upper bound $u$ must be divisible by both 6 and 8.\nAn integer that is divisible by both 6 and 8 must be a common multiple of 6 and 8. The common multiples of two integers are the multiples of their least common multiple (lcm).\n\nLet's calculate the least common multiple of 6 and 8.\nThe prime factorization of 6 is $2^1 \\times 3^1$.\nThe prime factorization of 8 is $2^3$.\nThe lcm is found by taking the highest power of each prime factor present in either factorization.\n$$ \\text{lcm}(6, 8) = 2^{\\max(1,3)} \\times 3^{\\max(1,0)} = 2^3 \\times 3^1 = 8 \\times 3 = 24 $$\nSo, any upper bound of $S$ must be a multiple of 24.\n\nNow, we need to find which of these multiples of 24 are actually elements of the set $D_{72}$.\nThe multiples of 24 are $24, 48, 72, 96, \\dots$.\nWe check which of these belong to $D_{72} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72\\}$.\n- Is 24 in $D_{72}$? Yes, $72 = 3 \\times 24$.\n- Is 48 in $D_{72}$? No, 72 is not divisible by 48.\n- Is 72 in $D_{72}$? Yes, $72 = 1 \\times 72$.\n- Any multiple of 24 greater than 72 cannot be a divisor of 72.\n\nTherefore, the set of all upper bounds of $S = \\{6, 8\\}$ in $D_{72}$ is $\\{24, 72\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the least upper bound (supremum) of S.**\n\nThe least upper bound (supremum) of $S$, denoted $\\sup(S)$, is the unique upper bound that is \"smaller\" than all other upper bounds in the sense of the partial order. That is, if $U$ is the set of all upper bounds, the supremum is an element $l \\in U$ such that for all $u \\in U$, we have $l | u$.\n\nThe set of upper bounds is $U = \\{24, 72\\}$.\nWe need to find an element in this set which divides all other elements in the set.\n- Check 24: Does 24 divide 24? Yes. Does 24 divide 72? Yes, because $72 = 3 \\times 24$.\n- Check 72: Does 72 divide 24? No.\n\nSince 24 divides every element in the set of upper bounds $\\{24, 72\\}$, it is the least element of the set of upper bounds with respect to the divisibility relation. Thus, the least upper bound (supremum) of $S$ is 24.\n\n**Step 3: Match the findings with the given options.**\n\nOur findings are:\n- The set of upper bounds is $\\{24, 72\\}$.\n- The least upper bound is 24.\n\nThis corresponds exactly to option A.\nLet's analyze the other options to see why they are incorrect:\n- B: Incorrectly claims $\\{24\\}$ is the complete set of upper bounds. It omits 72.\n- C: Incorrectly includes 48 in the set of upper bounds. 48 is not a divisor of 72.\n- D: Incorrectly identifies the set of upper bounds and the least upper bound. 24 is also an upper bound, and is smaller than 72 in the poset ordering.\n- E: Correctly identifies the set of upper bounds but incorrectly identifies the least upper bound as 72. The least upper bound is the minimal element of the upper bound set under the partial order, not the maximal one.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1389463"}, {"introduction": "In mathematics, we often construct complex objects from simpler building blocks.
