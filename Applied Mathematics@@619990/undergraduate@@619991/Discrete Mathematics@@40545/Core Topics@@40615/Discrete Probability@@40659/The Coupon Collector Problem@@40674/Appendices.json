These artifacts are obtained by opening \"Time Capsules.\" Each time a capsule is opened, it reveals one of the $n$ artifacts, chosen uniformly at random and independently of all previous openings. This means a player can receive duplicates of artifacts they already possess.\n\nAmong the $n$ artifacts, one is designated as the \"Legendary Keystone.\" A player's collection is considered complete only when they have acquired at least one of each of the $n$ unique artifacts.\n\nAssume a player starts with no artifacts.

Consider the sequence of discoveries of new artifacts (i.e., the first time each distinct artifact is obtained).

Suppose $k-1$ distinct artifacts have already been collected. At the next time a new artifact is obtained, the conditional probability that it is any particular one among the $n-(k-1)$ not yet seen is computed as follows. On any single draw, the probability to obtain a specific not-yet-seen artifact is $1/n$, and the probability to obtain any not-yet-seen artifact is $(n-(k-1))/n$. By the definition of conditional probability,\n$$\n\\Pr(\\text{next new artifact is a given one}\\mid \\text{next draw is new})\n=\\frac{1/n}{(n-(k-1))/n}=\\frac{1}{n-(k-1)}.\n$$\nTherefore, for any fixed permutation $(y_{1},y_{2},\\dots,y_{n})$ of the $n$ artifacts, its probability as the order of first appearances is\n$$\n\\Pr(Y_{1}=y_{1},\\dots,Y_{n}=y_{n})\n=\\prod_{k=1}^{n}\\frac{1}{n-(k-1)}=\\frac{1}{n!}.\n$$\nThus the order of first appearances is uniformly distributed over all $n!$ permutations.
