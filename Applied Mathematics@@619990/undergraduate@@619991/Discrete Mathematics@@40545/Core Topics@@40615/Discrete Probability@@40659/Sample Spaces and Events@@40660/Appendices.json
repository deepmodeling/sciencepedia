The memory buffer of the unit receives these four packets in a random order. The set of all possible ordered arrangements of these packets forms the sample space for this operation. An individual outcome in this sample space can be represented by a permutation $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)$, where $x_i$ is the packet in the $i$-th position of the buffer.\n\nThe system's diagnostic software monitors for specific undesirable configurations. Let's define two such configurations as events:\n- Event $A$ is the set of outcomes where the packet $P_1$ is in the first position of the buffer (i.e., $x_1 = P_1$).\n- Event $B$ is the set of outcomes where the packet $P_2$ is in the second position of the buffer (i.e., $x_2 = P_2$).\n\nA \"valid\" configuration is one where neither event $A$ nor event $B$ occurs.

The total number of outcomes in the sample space is the number of ways to arrange four distinct items, which is given by the factorial of 4.\n$$|S| = 4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24$$\n\nLet event $A$ be the set of outcomes where $P_1$ is in the first position.\nLet event $B$ be the set of outcomes where $P_2$ is in the second position.\n\nWe are looking for the number of outcomes that are in neither $A$ nor $B$. This is the number of elements in the complement of the union of $A$ and $B$, denoted as $|(A \\cup B)^c|$ or $|S| - |A \\cup B|$.\n\nTo find $|A \\cup B|$, we use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion for two sets:\n$$|A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B|$$\n\nFirst, we calculate $|A|$, the number of permutations where $P_1$ is in the first position.
