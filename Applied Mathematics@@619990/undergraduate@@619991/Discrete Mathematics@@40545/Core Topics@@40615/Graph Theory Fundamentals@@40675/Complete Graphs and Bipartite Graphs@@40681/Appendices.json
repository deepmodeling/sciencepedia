This first exercise provides a practical scenario of upgrading a network, which requires you to quantify the difference in connectivity between a simple path graph and a fully-connected, or complete, graph. By working through this problem, you will solidify your understanding of the formula for the number of edges in a complete graph, $K_n$, a fundamental building block in graph theory [@problem_id:1357677].", "problem": "A data center houses 7 distinct servers. For routine maintenance, the servers are connected sequentially in a chain-like topology: server $S_1$ is connected to $S_2$, $S_2$ is connected to $S_3$, and so on, up to $S_6$ being connected to $S_7$. This forms a network structure known as a path graph. To improve data transfer speeds and reliability, the administrators decide to implement a fully-connected mesh topology, where every server is directly connected to every other server. This new structure is known as a complete graph. Assuming the existing connections are kept, how many additional direct connections must be installed to achieve this fully-connected topology?", "solution": "The problem asks for the number of edges that must be added to a path graph on 7 vertices, $P_7$, to transform it into a complete graph on 7 vertices, $K_7$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the number of edges in the initial network configuration. The servers are connected in a sequential chain, which corresponds to a path graph. A path graph on $n$ vertices, denoted $P_n$, consists of $n$ vertices $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n$ and edges $\\{v_i, v_{i+1}\\}$ for $i=1, 2, \\dots, n-1$. The number of edges in $P_n$ is therefore $n-1$.\nIn this problem, there are $n=7$ servers. So, the initial network is a $P_7$. The number of existing connections (edges) is:\n$$|E(P_7)| = 7 - 1 = 6$$\n\nNext, let's determine the number of edges in the final, fully-connected network configuration. This corresponds to a complete graph. A complete graph on $n$ vertices, denoted $K_n$, is a graph in which every distinct pair of vertices is connected by an edge. The number of edges in $K_n$ is equal to the number of ways to choose 2 vertices out of $n$, which is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{2}$.\n$$|E(K_n)| = \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$\nFor the 7 servers, the final network is a $K_7$. The total number of connections required for this topology is:\n$$|E(K_7)| = \\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7(7-1)}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = \\frac{42}{2} = 21$$\n\nThe problem asks for the number of additional connections that must be installed. This is the difference between the number of edges in the final configuration ($K_7$) and the number of edges in the initial configuration ($P_7$).\nNumber of additional connections = $|E(K_7)| - |E(P_7)|$\nNumber of additional connections = $21 - 6 = 15$\n\nTherefore, 15 additional connections must be installed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{15}$$", "id": "1357677"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of edge counting, this next practice presents a choice between two distinct network designs. This thought experiment introduces the complete bipartite graph, $K_{m,n}$, and its characteristic structure, contrasting it directly with the complete graph, $K_n$. This comparison is crucial for learning to differentiate between these important classes of graphs based on their fundamental properties, such as the total number of connections [@problem_id:1357699].", "problem": "Two competing network designs are proposed for a new high-performance computing cluster.\n\nDesign Alpha proposes a fully connected (or \"all-to-all\") topology for a set of $n$ identical processing nodes, where $n > 1$. In this design, every node is directly connected to every other node by a dedicated communication link. In graph theory, this topology corresponds to a complete graph, denoted $K_n$.\n\nDesign Beta proposes a two-tiered architecture. This design uses a group of 4 dedicated network switches and a group of 9 processing nodes. In this topology, each of the 4 switches is connected to each of the 9 processing nodes. However, no direct connections exist between switches, and no direct connections exist between processing nodes. This topology corresponds to a complete bipartite graph, denoted $K_{4,9}$.\n\nDetermine the integer value of $n$ for which Design Alpha requires the exact same number of communication links as Design Beta.", "solution": "In Design Alpha, the topology is a complete graph $K_{n}$ on $n$ nodes.

Given a list of desired collaboration counts (a degree sequence), this problem asks whether it's possible to organize a project team into two distinct divisions, a hallmark of a bipartite structure. This exercise challenges you to apply the necessary conditions related to degree sums and partitions, developing your skills in logical deduction and verifying the underlying properties of bipartite graphs [@problem_id:1357680].", "problem": "A tech company is organizing a cross-functional project involving employees from two divisions: Research, and Development. A total of 8 employees are selected to participate. The project structure requires that any collaboration must be between a Research employee and a Development employee. No two employees from the same division can collaborate.\n\nThe project manager has defined the required number of collaborations for each of the 8 employees. This list of collaboration counts is $(4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3)$. It has not yet been decided which employee will be assigned to which division.\n\nDetermine if it is possible to assign the 8 employees to the two divisions (Research and Development) and form the collaboration pairs such that every employee meets their required collaboration count, and no pair of employees collaborates more than once. If such an assignment is possible, what must be the size of the smaller of the two divisions? If it is not possible, provide an answer of 0.", "solution": "Let the two divisions form the bipartition of a simple bipartite graph with parts of sizes $m$ and $n$, with $m+n=8$. Every collaboration is an edge across the partition, and no pair collaborates more than once means the graph is simple.\n\nThe given degrees are $(4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3)$. In any bipartite graph, the degree of a vertex on one side is at most the size of the opposite side. Since there exists a vertex of degree $4$, the side opposite to that vertex must have size at least $4$. If we assume without loss of generality that $m \\leq n$, then $m \\leq 3$ would force all degrees on the $n$-side to be at most $3$, contradicting the presence of degree $4$. Hence $m \\geq 4$. With $m+n=8$ and $m \\leq n$, it follows that $m=n=4$. Therefore, the smaller division must have size $4$.\n\nNext, verify that the degree requirements can be met. In a bipartite graph, the sum of degrees on each side equals the total number of edges counted from that side. The total sum of degrees is\n$$\nS=4+4+4+4+3+3+3+3=28,\n$$\nso each side must have degree sum $14$.\n\nAssign to one side $a$ vertices of degree $4$ and $b$ vertices of degree $3$. Since there are $4$ vertices on a side, $a+b=4$, and the sum of degrees on that side must be\n$$\n4a+3b=14.\n$$\nSolving $4a+3(4-a)=14$ gives $a=2$ and $b=2$. Thus each side must have degree multiset $\\{4,4,3,3\\}$.\n\nTo certify existence, apply the Galeâ€“Ryser criterion. Let the left side degrees be $r=(4,4,3,3)$ and the right side degrees be $c=(4,4,3,3)$, both sorted nonincreasing, with $\\sum r_{i}=\\sum c_{j}=14$. The condition requires, for each $t\\in\\{1,2,3,4\\}$,\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{t} r_{i} \\leq \\sum_{j=1}^{4} \\min(t,c_{j}).\n$$\nCompute:\n- For $t=1$: $4 \\leq 1+1+1+1=4$.\n- For $t=2$: $4+4=8 \\leq 2+2+2+2=8$.\n- For $t=3$: $4+4+3=11 \\leq 3+3+3+3=12$.\n- For $t=4$: $14 \\leq 4+4+3+3=14$.\n\nAll inequalities hold, so such a bipartite graph exists. Therefore, it is possible, and the smaller division must have size $4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "1357680"}]}
