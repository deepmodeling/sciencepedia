We define a few key properties related to connectivity:\n\n1.  A digraph is **strongly connected** if for every pair of distinct vertices $(u, v)$ in $V$, there is a directed path from $u$ to $v$ and a directed path from $v$ to $u$.\n2.  A digraph is **weakly connected** if replacing all of its directed edges with undirected edges produces a connected undirected graph (i.e., there is a path between every pair of vertices, ignoring edge direction).\n3.  A **strongly connected component (SCC)** of a digraph is a maximal set of vertices where any vertex in the set is reachable from any other vertex in the set via a directed path.

However, from $3$ or $4$ the only reachable vertices are $3$ and $4$ (since edges are $3\\to 4$ and $4\\to 3$), so there is no path from $3$ or $4$ back to $2$ or $1$. Hence the graph is not strongly connected.\n- Weakly connected: The undirected edges are $\\{1,2\\},\\{2,3\\},\\{3,4\\}$ (the pair $\\{3,4\\}$ arises from both $(3,4)$ and $(4,3)$). This undirected graph is the path $1-2-3-4$, which is connected.

Vertices $3$ and $4$ have mutual reachability via $(3,4)$ and $(4,3)$, so $\\{3,4\\}$ is an SCC. There is an edge from $2$ to $3$ but no path back from $\\{3,4\\}$ to $\\{1,2\\}$, so these SCCs do not merge.

For any $u,v\\in V$ there is a directed path along the cycle from $u$ to $v$ and from $v$ to $u$, so the graph is strongly connected. It therefore fails the requirement “not strongly connected,” and it has exactly one SCC, not two.\n\nGraph C: $E_{C}=\\{(1,2),(2,1),(3,4)\\}$.\n- Weak connectivity: The undirected edges are $\\{1,2\\}$ and $\\{3,4\\}$, which form two disjoint edges. This undirected graph is disconnected, so the digraph is not weakly connected.\n- SCCs: $\\{1,2\\}$ is an SCC by mutual edges. Vertex $3$ has an outgoing edge to $4$ but no return path, and vertex $4$ has no outgoing edge, so $\\{3\\}$ and $\\{4\\}$ are singleton SCCs.
