In many practical scenarios, it's sufficient for a route to cover every connection exactly once, even if it starts and ends at different locations. This defines an Euler path.

For a connected graph, an Euler trail exists if and only if the number of vertices of odd degree is either 0 or 2; if it is 0, the trail is a circuit. The complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$ with $m,n \\geq 1$ is connected, so this criterion applies.\n\nIn $K_{m,n}$, each of the $m$ vertices on one side has degree $n$, and each of the $n$ vertices on the other side has degree $m$. Therefore, the number of vertices of odd degree equals the number of vertices in the part whose degree is odd:\n- If $n$ is odd, then all $m$ vertices on the $m$-side have odd degree, contributing $m$ odd-degree vertices.\n- If $m$ is odd, then all $n$ vertices on the $n$-side have odd degree, contributing $n$ odd-degree vertices.\n- If $m$ is even, then the $n$-side contributes $0$ odd-degree vertices; if $n$ is even, then the $m$-side contributes $0$ odd-degree vertices.\n\nSummarizing:\n- If both $m$ and $n$ are even, the number of odd-degree vertices is $0$, so an Euler circuit (hence a traversal) exists.\n- If $m$ is odd and $n=2$, then the $m$-side vertices have degree $2$ (even) and the two vertices on the $n$-side have degree $m$ (odd), giving exactly $2$ odd-degree vertices, so an Euler trail exists. Symmetrically, if $n$ is odd and $m=2$, exactly $2$ odd-degree vertices occur, so an Euler trail exists.\n- If $m=n=1$, both vertices have degree $1$, so there are exactly $2$ odd-degree vertices and an Euler trail exists.\n- If both $m$ and $n$ are odd in general, the number of odd-degree vertices is $m+n$. This equals $2$ only when $m=n=1$; otherwise it is at least $4$, so no Euler trail exists in general. Hence the condition “both odd” is not sufficient.\n- If $m+n$ is even, then either both are even (which works) or both are odd (which generally does not work, except for $m=n=1$).

The engineers have identified exactly four intersections in the city that have an odd number of road segments connected to them. Let's label these four \"unbalanced\" intersections as A, B, C, and D.

Specifically, the cost $C$ to connect two points with a distance $d$ is given by the formula $C = d^2$. To make the network traversable as required, the city must build the minimum number of tunnels necessary, chosen in such a way that the total construction cost is minimized.\n\nCalculate the minimum total cost required to make the street network meet the traversal requirement.
