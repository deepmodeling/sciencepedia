By considering a network where every node has the same number of connections—a $k$-regular graph—you'll use the Handshaking Lemma to establish a direct and powerful relationship between the number of nodes, their connectivity, and the total number of links required [@problem_id:1350938]. This calculation is fundamental in planning the infrastructure for symmetric systems like high-performance computing clusters.", "problem": "A team of network architects is designing the physical layout of a new high-performance computing cluster. The cluster consists of a number of identical server nodes. The design mandates a highly symmetric and robust network topology where each server node has a direct fiber optic connection to the same number of other nodes. In the language of graph theory, this network can be modeled as a simple graph where the server nodes are the vertices and the fiber optic connections are the edges. A graph in which every vertex has the same degree is known as a regular graph. If the degree of each vertex is $k$, it is called a $k$-regular graph.\n\nThe final design specifies a cluster with $v = 48$ server nodes. For optimal data throughput and redundancy, the network topology must be a $7$-regular graph. Calculate the total number of individual fiber optic connections (edges) required to construct this network.", "solution": "Let $v$ denote the number of vertices, $k$ the common degree of each vertex in a $k$-regular simple graph, and let $E$ denote the number of edges. By the Handshaking Lemma, the sum of the degrees equals twice the number of edges:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{v} \\deg(v_{i}) = 2|E|.\n$$\nFor a $k$-regular graph, each vertex has degree $k$, so the sum of degrees is $vk$.

The system is composed of two types of nodes: \"Master\" nodes, responsible for coordination, and \"Worker\" nodes, which perform computational tasks.

Every Master node must be connected to exactly 8 other nodes.\n2.  Every Worker node must be connected to exactly 3 other nodes.\n3.  For system stability and redundancy, the number of Worker nodes must be exactly five times the number of Master nodes.\n4.

A simple graph is used to model the network, where vertices represent data centers and edges represent direct fiber links. A graph is \"simple\" if it has no loops (edges from a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same pair of vertices. The \"degree\" of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it. For reasons of hardware homogeneity, the design specifies that every data center must be connected to exactly two other distinct data centers. This means the graph model must have a degree sequence of (2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2), where each of the 6 vertices has a degree of 2.\n\nIt turns out there are multiple fundamentally different network topologies that satisfy this requirement. In graph theory, we say two graphs are \"non-isomorphic\" if one cannot be transformed into the other simply by relabeling its vertices. One way to characterize the \"sprawl\" of such a network is by finding the length of the longest possible journey that visits a sequence of distinct data centers. This corresponds to the length of the longest \"simple path\" in the graph, where a simple path is a path that does not contain any repeated vertices. The length of a path is defined as the number of edges it contains.\n\nDetermine all possible values for the length of the longest simple path among the non-isomorphic simple graphs that can be constructed on 6 vertices with the degree sequence (2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2).

Hence the length of any simple path in $C_{k}$ is at most $k-1$. This upper bound is achieved by following $k-1$ consecutive edges along the cycle, which visits all $k$ vertices exactly once. Therefore, the maximum simple-path length in $C_{k}$ is $k-1$.\n\nApplying this:\n- In $C_{6}$, the longest simple path has length $6-1=5$.\n- In $C_{3} \\cup C_{3}$, the graph is disconnected, so a simple path lies entirely within one triangle; its maximum length is $3-1=2$.\n\nTherefore, the set of all possible values for the length of the longest simple path, over all non-isomorphic simple graphs on $6$ vertices with degree sequence $(2,2,2,2,2,2)$, is $\\{2,5\\}$, listed in ascending order.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 5 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1350909"}]}
