In this system, each computer is represented as a \"node,\" and a direct, two-way communication channel between two computers is represented as a \"connection.\" The design adheres to two strict rules:\n1.  A connection must link two distinct nodes; a node cannot be connected to itself.\n2.  Between any pair of nodes, there can be at most one direct connection.\n\nThese rules imply that the network topology can be modeled as a simple graph. The team has proposed several possible configurations, each specifying the total number of nodes and the number of connections each node must have. Your task is to identify which of the following proposed designs is fundamentally impossible to construct.\n\nA. A network with 10 nodes, where each node has exactly 3 connections.\n\nB.

By the Handshaking Lemma, the sum of all vertex degrees equals twice the number of edges, hence is even. For a $k$-regular graph on $n$ vertices, the total degree sum is $nk$, so a necessary condition is that $nk$ is even; in particular, if $k$ is odd then $n$ must be even.\n\nAnalyze each option:\n\nFor option A: $n=10$, each degree $3$. The total degree sum is $10 \\cdot 3 = 30$, which is even, and since $3$ is odd and $n$ is even, the parity condition holds. A concrete construction exists: take a $10$-cycle and add a perfect matching to obtain a $3$-regular simple graph. Thus A is possible.\n\nFor option B: $n=7$, each degree $4$. The total degree sum is $7 \\cdot 4 = 28$, which is even. Consider the complement graph, which would be $2$-regular on $7$ vertices. A $2$-regular simple graph is a disjoint union of cycles, and $7$ can be realized as a single $7$-cycle or as a union of a $3$-cycle and a $4$-cycle, so such a complement exists. Therefore a $4$-regular graph on $7$ vertices exists. Thus B is possible.\n\nFor option C: $n=9$, each degree $5$. The total degree sum is $9 \\cdot 5 = 45$, which is odd. By the Handshaking Lemma, this is impossible for a simple graph. Equivalently, since $5$ is odd, $n$ would have to be even, but $9$ is odd. Thus C is impossible.\n\nFor option D: $n=12$, each degree $2$. A $2$-regular simple graph is a disjoint union of cycles. With $12$ vertices, one can take a single $12$-cycle, so such a graph exists. Thus D is possible.\n\nFor option E: Degrees are $3,3,3,3,3,1$. The degree sum is $5 \\cdot 3 + 1 = 16$, which is even. Apply the Havel–Hakimi process to verify graphicality step by step:\nStart with $(3,3,3,3,3,1)$. Remove a $3$ and subtract $1$ from the next three entries to get $(2,2,2,3,1)$, which sorted is $(3,2,2,2,1)$. Remove a $3$ and subtract $1$ from the next three entries to get $(1,1,1,1)$. Remove a $1$ and subtract $1$ from the next one entry to get $(0,1,1)$, which sorted is $(1,1,0)$. Remove a $1$ and subtract $1$ from the next one entry to get $(0,0)$. This terminates with all zeros, so the sequence is graphical. Thus E is possible.\n\nTherefore, the only impossible configuration is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1400592"}, {"introduction": "While a graph's degree sequence tells us a great deal, it doesn't reveal the whole story, especially when we move beyond simple graphs.

A **multigraph** consists of a set of vertices $V$ and a multiset of edges $E$. Each edge is an unordered pair of distinct vertices. Since $E$ is a multiset, multiple edges between the same two vertices are permitted, but loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) are not. A simple graph is a special case of a multigraph where the multiplicity of any edge is at most one.\n\nThe **degree** of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it, where an edge of multiplicity $k$ contributes $k$ to the degree of each of its endpoints. The **degree sequence** of a graph is a list of the degrees of its vertices, typically sorted in non-increasing order.\n\nTwo multigraphs, $G_1 = (V_1, E_1)$ and $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$, are said to be **isomorphic** if there exists a bijection (a one-to-one correspondence) $f: V_1 \\to V_2$ that preserves the edge-multiplicity structure. That is, for any pair of vertices $u, v \\in V_1$, the number of edges between $u$ and $v$ in $G_1$ must be equal to the number of edges between $f(u)$ and $f(v)$ in $G_2$.\n\nConsider multigraphs on the vertex set $V = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.
