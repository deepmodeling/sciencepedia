The key is to find a \"graph invariant\"—a property that is preserved under isomorphism—which holds a different value for each graph. This exercise [@problem_id:1379146] provides a perfect opportunity to practice this fundamental technique by comparing two proposed network designs and identifying an invariant that proves they are not structurally equivalent.", "problem": "Two different designs are proposed for the communication network architecture of a new 6-node satellite constellation. In graph theory terms, the nodes are vertices and the communication links are edges. The two designs, named \"Alpha\" and \"Beta,\" are described as follows:\n\n- **Alpha Design:** The six nodes, labeled 1 through 6, are arranged in a single ring. Node 1 is linked to Node 2 and Node 6. Node 2 is linked to Node 1 and Node 3. This pattern continues sequentially, culminating with Node 6 being linked to Node 5 and Node 1.\n\n- **Beta Design:** The six nodes are split into two independent triangular clusters. In the first cluster, Nodes A, B, and C are all linked to each other (A-B, B-C, C-A). In the second cluster, Nodes D, E, and F are also all linked to each other (D-E, E-F, F-D). There are no links between the two clusters.\n\nTwo network engineers are debating whether these two designs are structurally equivalent (isomorphic). To settle the debate, they decide to compute a structural property for each network. If the values of this property differ, it will definitively prove the networks are not isomorphic. Which of the following properties would allow them to prove that the Alpha and Beta designs are not structurally equivalent?\n\nA. The total number of nodes in the network.\n\nB. The total number of communication links in the network.\n\nC. The list of the number of links connected to each individual node.\n\nD. The length of the shortest closed loop of links in the network.\n\nE.

In graph-theoretic terms, $G_{\\alpha}\\cong C_{6}$ (a single cycle on $6$ vertices) and $G_{\\beta}\\cong K_{3}\\cup K_{3}$ (a disjoint union of two triangles). To prove non-isomorphism, it suffices to find a graph invariant that takes different values on $G_{\\alpha}$ and $G_{\\beta}$.\n\nBy definition, if two graphs are isomorphic, then they share all graph invariants such as number of vertices, number of edges, degree multiset, and girth (length of the shortest cycle).\n\nEvaluate each proposed property:\n\nA. Total number of nodes: $|V(G_{\\alpha})|=6$ and $|V(G_{\\beta})|=6$. This is equal, so it cannot distinguish.\n\nB. Total number of communication links: For $C_{6}$, $|E(C_{6})|=6$. For $K_{3}$, $|E(K_{3})|=3$, hence $|E(K_{3}\\cup K_{3})|=3+3=6$. Thus $|E(G_{\\alpha})|=|E(G_{\\beta})|=6$. This is equal, so it cannot distinguish.\n\nC.

In $K_{3}$, every vertex has degree $2$; in $K_{3}\\cup K_{3}$, all $6$ vertices still have degree $2$. Hence the degree lists are identical. This cannot distinguish.\n\nD. Length of the shortest cycle (girth): The girth of $C_{n}$ is $n$, so $\\operatorname{girth}(G_{\\alpha})=\\operatorname{girth}(C_{6})=6$. The girth of $K_{3}$ is $3$, and the girth of a disjoint union is the minimum of the girths of its components, so $\\operatorname{girth}(G_{\\beta})=\\min\\{3,3\\}=3$. Since $6\\neq 3$, this invariant differs, which proves $G_{\\alpha}$ and $G_{\\beta}$ are not isomorphic.\n\nE. Number of nodes of degree exactly $2$: As established, all $6$ vertices in both $G_{\\alpha}$ and $G_{\\beta}$ have degree $2$, so this number is $6$ for both graphs.

For the cycle graph $C_{5}$, every vertex has degree $2$, so its degree sequence is $(2,2,2,2,2)$. Since isomorphic graphs must have identical degree sequences, $G$ and $C_{5}$ are not isomorphic. The edge counts match, so a discrepancy in the number of edges is not the reason, and $G$ is connected (for instance, $5-2-3-4-1$ is a spanning path), so disconnectedness is not the reason either.
