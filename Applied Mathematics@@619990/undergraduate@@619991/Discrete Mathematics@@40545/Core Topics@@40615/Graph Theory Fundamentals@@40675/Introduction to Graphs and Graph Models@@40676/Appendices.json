Every data scientist must have a direct, unique communication channel to every other data scientist on the team.\n3.  To ensure seamless collaboration, every software engineer must also have a direct, unique communication channel to every data scientist.\n\nAssuming a channel between two people is the same regardless of direction (i.e., the channel from person A to person B is the same as from B to A), what is the total number of unique communication channels that must be established for this project?
