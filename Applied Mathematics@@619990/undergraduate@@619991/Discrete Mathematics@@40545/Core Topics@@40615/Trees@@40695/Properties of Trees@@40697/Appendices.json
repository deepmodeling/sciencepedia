Any structure that is fully connected but contains no redundant loops is, by definition, a tree.

The molecule is constructed from a total of $N$ individual atomic units. The design adheres to two fundamental structural rules:\n1.  The entire structure must be connected, meaning there is a path of chemical bonds between any two atomic units in the molecule.\n2.  To maximize flexibility and avoid unwanted steric hindrance, the chemical bonds must be arranged in a way that no closed loops of atoms are formed. That is, any path of bonds that starts from an atom and returns to the same atom must re-trace at least one bond along its journey.\n\nIf the macromolecule is composed of $N = 128$ atomic units, how many chemical bonds are required to form the structure while satisfying both design rules?", "solution": "Model the macromolecule as a finite undirected graph with $N$ vertices (atomic units) and $E$ edges (chemical bonds). The two design rules state that the graph must be connected and contain no cycles; such a graph is a tree.\n\nA standard graph-theoretic identity relates the number of edges $E$, the number of vertices $N$, the number of connected components $C$, and the cycle rank (cyclomatic number) $r$:\n$$\nr = E - N + C.\n$$\nFor an acyclic graph, $r=0$, hence\n$$\nE - N + C = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad E = N - C.\n$$\nConnectivity requires $C=1$, so for a connected acyclic graph (a tree),\n$$\nE = N - 1.\n$$\nSubstituting $N=128$ gives\n$$\nE = 128 - 1 = 127.\n$$\nTherefore, $127$ chemical bonds are required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{127}$$", "id": "1393378"}, {"introduction": "Having established the total number of edges in a tree, we can now investigate how these edges are distributed among the vertices.

To prevent data corruption from message-passing loops, the network is always maintained as a tree structure. In this graph-theoretic model, each computing node is a vertex, and a direct, two-way communication channel between two nodes is an edge. The degree of a node is defined as the number of communication channels connected to it.\n\nConsider a stable RAMP network consisting of $N$ nodes, where $N$ is an integer greater than 1.

An \"endpoint server\" is defined as a server that is connected to exactly one other server. All other servers are considered \"internal nodes\".

Thus the sum on the right includes at least one term $(11 - 2) = 9$. Every additional vertex with degree at least $3$ would add at least $1$ to the sum and therefore increase $n_{1}$. Hence, to minimize $n_{1}$, take exactly one vertex of degree $11$ and make all other non-leaf vertices have degree $2$.
