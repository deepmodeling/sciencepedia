This first exercise explores one of the most regular of these structures: a complete $m$-ary tree.

The network consists of a single root server and a hierarchy of relay nodes. The dissemination process begins at the root server, which is considered to be at level 0. Any node that receives the information (whether it is the root server or a relay node) immediately forwards it to exactly three distinct nodes at the next level, which have not yet received the information. This process continues until the information reaches the final layer of the network.\n\nNodes that receive the information but do not forward it are called \"terminal nodes\". In this particular network architecture, all terminal nodes are located at the same level. The \"height\" $h$ of the network is defined as the level at which these terminal nodes reside. For a network of height $h=0$, the root server itself is the only node and is considered a terminal node.\n\nFind a general formula for the number of terminal nodes in this network as a function of its height $h$, for any non-negative integer $h$.", "solution": "We model the dissemination as a rooted tree with branching factor $3$. Let $N_{k}$ denote the number of nodes at level $k$, with the root at level $0$.\n\nBy definition, $N_{0}=1$.\n\nFor the step from level $k$ to level $k+1$, each node at level $k$ forwards the information to exactly three distinct nodes at level $k+1$ that have not yet received the information. Because no node can receive the information more than once, the three-node sets chosen by different parents at level $k$ are pairwise disjoint. Therefore, the total number of new nodes formed at level $k+1$ is exactly three times the number of nodes at level $k$. This establishes the recurrence\n$$\nN_{k+1}=3\\,N_{k}.\n$$\n\nSolving this recurrence with the initial condition gives by induction (or recognizing a geometric progression)\n$$\nN_{k}=3^{k}.\n$$\n\nAll terminal nodes lie at level $h$ by the definition of the network’s height, so the number of terminal nodes is $N_{h}$. Hence,\n$$\n\\text{terminal nodes at height }h=3^{h}.\n$$\n\nThis also correctly handles the base case $h=0$, yielding $3^{0}=1$, meaning the root alone is terminal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3^{h}}$$", "id": "1378379"}, {"introduction": "While height gives us one measure of a tree's scale, the number of internal vertices offers another powerful perspective. This practice establishes a fundamental relationship between the number of 'decision-making' internal nodes and the total number of nodes in a full $m$-ary tree [@problem_id:1378419].

The data structure is a full $m$-ary tree where the internal vertices represent transaction hubs and the leaves represent individual transaction records. For this particular ledger design, it is specified that every transaction hub must branch out to exactly $m=5$ other nodes (which can be other hubs or transaction records).\n\nIf a specific instance of this ledger contains exactly 121 transaction hubs, what is the total number of nodes (hubs and records combined) in this tree structure?", "solution": "Let $m$ denote the arity, $i$ the number of internal vertices (transaction hubs), $l$ the number of leaves (transaction records), and $n$ the total number of nodes.\n\nIn any tree, the number of edges equals $n-1$.

This exercise demonstrates how basic principles can be combined to reveal deep structural properties true for all trees, regardless of their specific shape.", "problem": "A technology company is designing the network architecture for a new distributed computing cluster. The design specifies that the network topology must be a tree to prevent data loops and ensure that there is exactly one unique path between any two nodes. The nodes in the network are categorized into two types: \"edge nodes\" and \"core routers\".\n\nAn edge node is a computing node with a degree of exactly one, serving as an entry or termination point in the network. A core router is an internal computing node with a degree greater than one, responsible for routing traffic between different segments of the network.\n\nThe total number of nodes in the entire network (comprising both edge nodes and core routers) is denoted by $n$. The sum of the degrees of all the core routers in the network is given as $S$.\n\nBased on this information, derive a general expression for the total number of edge nodes in the network in terms of $n$ and $S$.", "solution": "Let $L$ denote the number of edge nodes (degree exactly $1$) and let $I$ denote the number of core routers (degree greater than $1$).

By the handshaking lemma, the sum of all vertex degrees equals twice the number of edges, hence the total degree sum is $2(n - 1)$.\n\nThe sum of degrees over all nodes is the sum over core routers plus the sum over edge nodes. By definition, the sum of degrees of core routers is $S$, and each edge node contributes degree $1$, so the sum over all edge nodes is $L$.
