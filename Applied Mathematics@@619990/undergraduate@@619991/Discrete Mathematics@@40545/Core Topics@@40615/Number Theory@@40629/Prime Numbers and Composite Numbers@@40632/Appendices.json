The LPS algorithm takes an integer $n > 1$ and a fixed integer test limit $L$ as inputs. Its procedure is to test whether $n$ is divisible by any prime number $p$ such that $p \\le L$. If such a prime divisor is found, the algorithm terminates and correctly identifies $n$ as composite. However, if $n$ is not divisible by any prime less than or equal to $L$, the algorithm classifies $n$ as \"Likely Prime\".\n\nThis classification is not always correct, as some composite numbers can be designated as \"Likely Prime\". These numbers are known as \"LPS-deceptions\". Your task is to determine the smallest such deceptive number for a given test limit.\n\nGiven a test limit of $L = 40$, what is the smallest composite integer that the LPS algorithm would incorrectly classify as \"Likely Prime\"?", "solution": "The Limited Primality Sieve (LPS) with test limit $L$ classifies an integer $n>1$ as \"Likely Prime\" precisely when no prime $p \\leq L$ divides $n$. By the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, this is equivalent to saying that all prime divisors of $n$ are strictly greater than $L$.\n\nWe seek the smallest composite $n$ with no prime divisor $\\leq L=40$. Let $p$ be the smallest prime strictly greater than $L$. Then any such composite $n$ must have all prime factors at least $p$, so the minimal possibility (counting multiplicity) is obtained by taking the product of the two smallest such prime factors, which yields\n$$\nn_{\\min} = p^{2}.\n$$\nThis follows because any composite has at least two prime factors counted with multiplicity, and using any larger primes would only increase the product.\n\nWe now identify $p$ for $L=40$. We check $41$ for primality by testing divisibility by primes $\\leq \\sqrt{41}$. Since\n$$\n\\sqrt{41} < 7,\n$$\nwe only need to test divisibility by $2$, $3$, and $5$. We have\n$$\n41 \\bmod 2 = 1, \\quad 41 \\bmod 3 = 2, \\quad 41 \\bmod 5 = 1,\n$$\nso $41$ is prime. Therefore $p=41$, and the smallest composite with all prime factors $>40$ is\n$$\nn_{\\min} = 41^{2}.\n$$\nCompute using the binomial identity $(a+b)^{2}=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}$ with $a=40$ and $b=1$:\n$$\n41^{2} = (40+1)^{2} = 40^{2} + 2 \\cdot 40 \\cdot 1 + 1^{2} = 1600 + 80 + 1 = 1681.\n$$\nFinally, since $41$ is the only prime divisor of $1681$ and $41>40$, the LPS with $L=40$ does not test divisibility by $41$, so it would incorrectly classify $1681$ as \"Likely Prime\". By the minimality argument above, no smaller composite can avoid all prime factors $\\leq 40$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest LPS-deception for $L=40$ is $1681$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1681}$$", "id": "1392441"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply identifying composite numbers, a key skill is to find their unique prime factors.
