Write $n=2k+1$ with $k\\in\\mathbb{Z}$. Then\n$$\nn^{2}-1=(n-1)(n+1)=(2k)(2k+2)=4k(k+1).\n$$\nAmong $k$ and $k+1$ exactly one is even, so $k(k+1)$ is even. Therefore there exists an integer $t$ such that $k(k+1)=2t$, and hence\n$$\nn^{2}-1=4\\cdot 2t=8t.\n$$\nThus every $n^{2}-1$ with $n$ odd is divisible by $8$, so $8$ is a common divisor of all non-zero elements of $S$.\n\nTo show the greatest common divisor is exactly $8$, it suffices to produce a non-zero element of $S$ that is not divisible by $16$. Taking $n=3$ (which is odd) gives\n$$\n3^{2}-1=8,\n$$\nwhich is not divisible by $16$.

This problem [@problem_id:1366122] is not about finding the greatest common divisor ($GCD$) of two fixed numbers, but about understanding how the $GCD$ of two linear expressions can be constrained.

Consider the two integers defined by the expressions $P(n) = 3n + 2$ and $Q(n) = 2n + 5$. The value of the greatest common divisor of $P(n)$ and $Q(n)$, denoted as $\\gcd(P(n), Q(n))$, can vary depending on the specific integer value of $n$.

A fundamental property of the greatest common divisor is that if $d$ divides two numbers, it must also divide any integer linear combination of them. We can choose a linear combination that eliminates the variable $n$. Let's compute $3 \\times Q(n) - 2 \\times P(n)$:\n$$\n3(2n+5) - 2(3n+2) = (6n+15) - (6n+4) = 11.\n$$\nSince $d$ divides both $3n+2$ and $2n+5$, it must also divide $11$. Therefore, the only possible values for the greatest common divisor are the positive divisors of 11, which are $1$ and $11$. The greatest possible value is thus at most $11$.\n\nTo show that $11$ is attained, we require that both $P(n)$ and $Q(n)$ are divisible by $11$. We need to find an integer $n$ such that:\n$$\n3n+2\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2n+5\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}.\n$$\nSolve the first congruence: $3n\\equiv -2\\equiv 9 \\pmod{11}$. The multiplicative inverse of $3$ modulo $11$ is $4$ (because $3\\cdot 4 = 12 \\equiv 1\\pmod{11}$), so we get\n$$\nn\\equiv 4\\cdot 9\\equiv 36\\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}.\n$$\nWe can check this value of $n$ in the second congruence. If $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$, then $2n+5 \\equiv 2(3)+5 = 11 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\nBoth conditions are satisfied when $n\\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$. For instance, with $n=3$, we have $P(3)=3\\cdot 3+2=11$ and $Q(3)=2\\cdot 3+5=11$, giving\n$$\n\\gcd(P(3),Q(3))=\\gcd(11,11)=11.\n$$\nSince every $\\gcd(P(n),Q(n))$ must divide $11$ and the value $11$ is achieved, the greatest possible value is $11$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{11}$$", "id": "1366122"}, {"introduction": "Finally, we apply our knowledge to a practical scenario.
