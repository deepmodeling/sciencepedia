Each process cyclically transitions through a set of internal states, which are labeled by non-negative integers. The state of each process is determined by the number of clock ticks, $t \\ge 0$, that have elapsed since the system was initialized.\n\nProcess Alpha has a cycle of 17 states, labeled 0 through 16. Its state at time $t$ is given by the remainder of $t$ when divided by 17.\nProcess Beta has a cycle of 19 states, labeled 0 through 18.

Find the smallest positive integer $t$, at which this specific combination of states first occurs.", "solution": "Let $t$ be the number of clock ticks that have elapsed. The problem provides us with two conditions on $t$.\n\nThe first condition is that Process Alpha is in state 4. Since Process Alpha has a cycle of 17 states, this can be expressed as a congruence relation:\n$$t \\equiv 4 \\pmod{17}$$\n\nThe second condition is that Process Beta is in state 10. Since Process Beta has a cycle of 19 states, this gives us a second congruence relation:\n$$t \\equiv 10 \\pmod{19}$$\n\nWe are looking for the smallest positive integer $t$ that satisfies this system of linear congruences.\n$$t \\equiv 4 \\pmod{17}$$\n$$t \\equiv 10 \\pmod{19}$$\nThis is a problem that can be solved using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Since the moduli, 17 and 19, are distinct prime numbers, they are coprime, which guarantees a unique solution for $t$ modulo the product $17 \\times 19$.\n\nWe can solve this system using the method of substitution. From the first congruence, $t \\equiv 4 \\pmod{17}$, we can write $t$ in the general form:\n$$t = 17k + 4$$\nfor some integer $k$.\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $t$ into the second congruence:\n$$17k + 4 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{19}$$\nTo solve for $k$, we first isolate the term with $k$:\n$$17k \\equiv 10 - 4 \\pmod{19}$$\n$$17k \\equiv 6 \\pmod{19}$$\nTo simplify the coefficient of $k$, we can note that $17 \\equiv -2 \\pmod{19}$. Substituting this into the congruence gives:\n$$-2k \\equiv 6 \\pmod{19}$$\nNow, we can divide both sides by $-2$. In modular arithmetic, division by a number is equivalent to multiplication by its multiplicative inverse. We need to find the inverse of $-2$ modulo 19. The inverse of $-2$ is an integer $x$ such that $-2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{19}$. We can see that if we let $x=9$, then $-2 \\times 9 = -18$. Since $-18 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{19}$, the inverse of $-2$ modulo 19 is 9. Alternatively, we can see that if we divide both sides by 2, we get $-k \\equiv 3 \\pmod{19}$, so $k \\equiv -3 \\pmod{19}$.\n\nLet's use the second, simpler approach.\n$$-k \\equiv 3 \\pmod{19}$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ gives:\n$$k \\equiv -3 \\pmod{19}$$\nTo express this with a positive remainder, we add 19:\n$$k \\equiv 16 \\pmod{19}$$\nThis means that $k$ must be of the form $k = 19j + 16$ for some integer $j$.\n\nWe are looking for the smallest positive integer $t$. To find this, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer value for $k$. This occurs when we choose $j=0$, which gives $k = 16$.\n\nNow we substitute this value of $k$ back into our expression for $t$:\n$$t = 17k + 4$$\n$$t = 17(16) + 4$$\nLet's compute the product:\n$$17 \\times 16 = 17 \\times (10 + 6) = 170 + 102 = 272$$\nSo, we have:\n$$t = 272 + 4 = 276$$\nThe smallest positive integer value for $t$ is 276.\n\nTo verify the solution:\nFor $t=276$:\n$276 \\div 17 = 16$ with a remainder of $4$. So, $276 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{17}$.\n$276 \\div 19 = 14$ with a remainder of $10$. So, $276 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{19}$.\nBoth conditions are satisfied.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{276}$$", "id": "1827363"}, {"introduction": "Now we move to a more nuanced scenario where the moduli are not coprime.
