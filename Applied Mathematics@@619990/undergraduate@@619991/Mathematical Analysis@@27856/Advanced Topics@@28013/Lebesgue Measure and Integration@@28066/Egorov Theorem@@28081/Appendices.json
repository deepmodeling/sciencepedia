Let's analyze each condition.\n\nFirst, let's understand the functions and their convergence. The sequence of functions is given by $f_n(x) = \\frac{1}{1+nx^2}$ on the interval $I=[0,1]$.\nOn the interval of interest, $A_{\\delta} = [\\delta, 1]$ with $\\delta > 0$, for any fixed $x$, the value of $x$ is non-zero. The pointwise limit of the sequence on this interval is:\n$$f(x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_n(x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{1+nx^2} = 0 \\quad \\text{for } x \\in [\\delta, 1]$$\nThis is because as $n \\to \\infty$, the term $nx^2$ in the denominator grows without bound, forcing the fraction to zero.\n\nNow let's analyze the second condition. The condition states that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $n \\ge N$ and for all $x \\in A_{\\delta}$, we have $|f_n(x)| < \\epsilon$.\nSince the pointwise limit on $A_{\\delta}$ is the zero function, $f(x)=0$, this condition can be rewritten as $|f_n(x) - f(x)| < \\epsilon$. This is the definition of uniform convergence of the sequence $\\{f_n\\}$ to the function $f(x)=0$ on the set $A_{\\delta}$.\n\nTo check if this condition is met, we must determine if the convergence of $f_n$ to $0$ is uniform on $A_{\\delta} = [\\delta, 1]$. Uniform convergence is established if the supremum of the absolute difference between $f_n(x)$ and its limit function $f(x)$ over the set $A_{\\delta}$ tends to zero as $n \\to \\infty$.\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left( \\sup_{x \\in A_{\\delta}} |f_n(x) - f(x)| \\right) = 0 $$\nIn our case, this is:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left( \\sup_{x \\in [\\delta, 1]} \\left| \\frac{1}{1+nx^2} - 0 \\right| \\right) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left( \\sup_{x \\in [\\delta, 1]} \\frac{1}{1+nx^2} \\right) $$\nFor a fixed $n$, the function $g(x) = \\frac{1}{1+nx^2}$ is a positive and decreasing function of $x$ for $x > 0$. Therefore, on the interval $[\\delta, 1]$ where $\\delta > 0$, the maximum value (the supremum) of the function will occur at the smallest value of $x$, which is $x = \\delta$.\n$$ \\sup_{x \\in [\\delta, 1]} \\frac{1}{1+nx^2} = f_n(\\delta) = \\frac{1}{1+n\\delta^2} $$\nNow we evaluate the limit of this supremum as $n \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{1+n\\delta^2} = 0 $$\nSince $\\delta \\in (0,1)$, $\\delta$ is a fixed positive number, so the denominator $1+n\\delta^2$ goes to infinity as $n \\to \\infty$. The limit is indeed 0.\nThis means that for any choice of $\\delta \\in (0,1)$, the sequence $\\{f_n\\}$ converges uniformly to 0 on the interval $A_{\\delta} = [\\delta, 1]$. Therefore, Condition 2 is satisfied for any $\\delta \\in (0,1)$.\n\nNow, we use Condition 1 to find the specific value of $\\delta$.\nCondition 1 states that the Lebesgue measure of the set $A_{\\delta}$ must be exactly $0.93$. The set is the interval $A_{\\delta} = [\\delta, 1]$. The Lebesgue measure of an interval $[a,b]$ is simply its length, $b-a$.\n$$ m(A_{\\delta}) = m([\\delta, 1]) = 1 - \\delta $$\nWe are given that this measure must be $0.93$.
