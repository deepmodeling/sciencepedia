This problem leverages the inclusion-exclusion principle, $m(A \\cup B) = m(A) + m(B) - m(A \\cap B)$, and the monotonicity property of measures to solve what is essentially a resource optimization puzzle. By working through this hypothetical scenario about satellite instrument scheduling, you will gain a concrete understanding of how to determine bounds on the overlap between sets when their individual measures are known within a finite space. [@problem_id:2312580]", "problem": "A research satellite is in a stable orbit, and for a specific one-hour observation window, it has two primary instruments, an X-ray spectrometer and a particle detector, that can operate. Due to power constraints and data bus limitations, these instruments cannot always operate simultaneously. Let the total duration of the observation window be $T = 1.0$ hour.\n\nThe project plan requires that the X-ray spectrometer be active for a total duration of $T_X = 0.8 T$. The particle detector must be active for a total duration of $T_P = 0.5 T$. The time intervals during which each instrument is active can be fragmented and distributed arbitrarily throughout the one-hour window.\n\nAssuming the scheduling is optimized to minimize the overlap in their operation, what is the minimum possible total time that both instruments must be active simultaneously? Express your answer in minutes as a real number.", "solution": "Let the one-hour observation window be represented by a time interval $I$. The length of this interval, which corresponds to its Lebesgue measure $m(I)$, is $T = 1.0$ hour.\n\nLet $X$ be the set of time points within the interval $I$ when the X-ray spectrometer is active, and let $P$ be the set of time points when the particle detector is active. The problem states that the total duration of activity for each instrument corresponds to the measure of these sets.\nWe are given:\n$m(X) = T_X = 0.8 T$\n$m(P) = T_P = 0.5 T$\n\nThe time during which both instruments are active simultaneously is represented by the intersection of these two sets, $X \\cap P$. We want to find the minimum possible value for the measure of this intersection, $m(X \\cap P)$.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between the measures of two sets, their union, and their intersection is given by the principle of inclusion-exclusion for measures:\n$$m(X \\cup P) = m(X) + m(P) - m(X \\cap P)$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the measure of the intersection:\n$$m(X \\cap P) = m(X) + m(P) - m(X \\cup P)$$\nTo find the minimum possible value for $m(X \\cap P)$, we must subtract the largest possible value for $m(X \\cup P)$.\n\nSince both instruments operate within the one-hour window, the sets of active times $X$ and $P$ are both subsets of the total time interval $I$. Consequently, their union, $X \\cup P$, must also be a subset of $I$:\n$$X \\cup P \\subseteq I$$\nThe measure of a set cannot be larger than the measure of a set that contains it (monotonicity of measure). Therefore:\n$$m(X \\cup P) \\leq m(I)$$\nThe maximum possible value for the measure of the union is thus $m(I) = T$.\n$$m(X \\cup P)_{\\text{max}} = T$$\n\nSubstituting this maximum value into the rearranged inclusion-exclusion formula gives us the minimum possible measure for the intersection:\n$$m(X \\cap P)_{\\text{min}} = m(X) + m(P) - m(X \\cup P)_{\\text{max}}$$\n$$m(X \\cap P)_{\\text{min}} = m(X) + m(P) - T$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer in minutes. First, we convert all time durations to minutes.\nThe total window duration is $T = 1.0 \\text{ hour} = 60 \\text{ minutes}$.\nThe spectrometer's active time is $m(X) = 0.8 \\times 60 \\text{ minutes} = 48 \\text{ minutes}$.\nThe detector's active time is $m(P) = 0.5 \\times 60 \\text{ minutes} = 30 \\text{ minutes}$.\n\nNow, we can compute the minimum overlap time in minutes:\n$$m(X \\cap P)_{\\text{min}} = 48 \\text{ minutes} + 30 \\text{ minutes} - 60 \\text{ minutes}$$\n$$m(X \\cap P)_{\\text{min}} = 78 \\text{ minutes} - 60 \\text{ minutes}$$\n$$m(X \\cap P)_{\\text{min}} = 18 \\text{ minutes}$$\n\nThis minimum is achievable. For instance, in the interval $[0, 60]$, let the spectrometer be active on $[0, 48]$ and the particle detector be active on $[30, 60]$.

This exercise guides you to rigorously prove that the set of irrational numbers in an interval has the full measure of the interval itself.
