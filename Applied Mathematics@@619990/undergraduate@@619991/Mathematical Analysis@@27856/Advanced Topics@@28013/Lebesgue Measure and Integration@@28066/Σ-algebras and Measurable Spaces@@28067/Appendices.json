We only need to check if the pre-image of each individual value in the range of the random variable is an element of $\\mathcal{F}$.

Let's test the value $c=1$.\nThe pre-image is $V_1^{-1}(\\{1\\}) = \\{\\omega \\in \\Omega \\mid V_1(\\omega) = 1\\} = \\{1\\}$.\nNow we check if the set $\\{1\\}$ is an element of $\\mathcal{F}$.
