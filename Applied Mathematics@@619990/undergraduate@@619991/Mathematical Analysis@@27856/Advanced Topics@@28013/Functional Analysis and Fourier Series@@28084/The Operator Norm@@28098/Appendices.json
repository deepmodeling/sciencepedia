This first practice establishes a fundamental two-step method for calculating an operator norm.

[@problem_id:2327529]", "problem": "Consider the vector space $\\mathbb{R}^2$ equipped with the 1-norm (also known as the taxicab norm or Manhattan norm), which is defined for a vector $v=(x,y)$ as $\\|v\\|_1 = |x| + |y|$. Let $T: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ be a linear transformation defined by the rule $T(x, y) = (x + 2y, 3x - y)$.\n\nThe operator norm of $T$ induced by the 1-norm, denoted $\\|T\\|$, is defined as the supremum of the norms of the transformed vectors, taken over all vectors on the unit sphere. That is,\n$$ \\|T\\| = \\sup_{\\|v\\|_1=1} \\|T(v)\\|_1 $$\nCalculate the exact value of the operator norm $\\|T\\|$.", "solution": "To find the operator norm $\\|T\\|$, we need to calculate the supremum of $\\|T(v)\\|_1$ for all vectors $v=(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $\\|v\\|_1 = 1$. The condition $\\|v\\|_1 = 1$ means that $|x| + |y| = 1$.\n\nLet $v=(x,y)$ be such a vector. First, we apply the transformation $T$ to $v$:\n$$ T(v) = T(x,y) = (x + 2y, 3x - y) $$\n\nNext, we calculate the 1-norm of the resulting vector $T(v)$:\n$$ \\|T(v)\\|_1 = \\|(x + 2y, 3x - y)\\|_1 = |x + 2y| + |3x - y| $$\n\nOur goal is to find the maximum value of this expression subject to the constraint $|x|+|y|=1$. We can find an upper bound for $\\|T(v)\\|_1$ using the triangle inequality, which states $|a+b| \\le |a|+|b|$.\n$$ |x + 2y| \\le |x| + |2y| = |x| + 2|y| $$\n$$ |3x - y| \\le |3x| + |-y| = 3|x| + |y| $$\n\nAdding these two inequalities together, we get:\n$$ \\|T(v)\\|_1 = |x + 2y| + |3x - y| \\le (|x| + 2|y|) + (3|x| + |y|) = 4|x| + 3|y| $$\n\nSo, we have established that $\\|T(v)\\|_1 \\le 4|x| + 3|y|$ for any $(x,y)$. Now we need to find the maximum value of the expression $4|x| + 3|y|$ given the constraint $|x| + |y| = 1$.\n\nLet $u = |x|$ and $w = |y|$. The problem is now to maximize the function $f(u,w) = 4u + 3w$ subject to the constraints $u+w=1$, $u \\ge 0$, and $w \\ge 0$.\nWe can express $w$ in terms of $u$ from the constraint: $w = 1-u$. Substituting this into the function $f$, we get a function of a single variable $u$:\n$$ g(u) = 4u + 3(1-u) = 4u + 3 - 3u = u + 3 $$\nSince $u = |x|$ and $|x|+|y|=1$, the possible values for $u$ are in the interval $[0, 1]$. The function $g(u) = u+3$ is a strictly increasing linear function. Therefore, its maximum value on the interval $[0,1]$ occurs at the right endpoint, $u=1$.\nThe maximum value of a $g(u)$ is $g(1)=1+3=4$.\n\nThis tells us that for any vector $v$ with $\\|v\\|_1=1$, the norm of its image satisfies $\\|T(v)\\|_1 \\le 4$. By the definition of the supremum, this implies that $\\|T\\| \\le 4$.\n\nTo show that the supremum is exactly 4, we must demonstrate that this upper bound can be achieved. We need to find a specific vector $v_0 = (x_0, y_0)$ such that $\\|v_0\\|_1=1$ and $\\|T(v_0)\\|_1=4$.\nThe maximum value of our bound $4|x|+3|y|$ was achieved when $|x|=u=1$ and $|y|=w=0$.\nLet's choose the vector $v_0 = (1, 0)$.\nFirst, we check its norm: $\\|v_0\\|_1 = |1| + |0| = 1$. So it is a unit vector.\nNow, we apply the transformation $T$ to $v_0$:\n$$ T(v_0) = T(1, 0) = (1 + 2(0), 3(1) - 0) = (1, 3) $$\nFinally, we compute the 1-norm of the result:\n$$ \\|T(v_0)\\|_1 = \\|(1, 3)\\|_1 = |1| + |3| = 4 $$\nSince we have found a vector $v_0$ on the unit sphere for which $\\|T(v_0)\\|_1 = 4$, and we have shown that $\\|T(v)\\|_1 \\le 4$ for all vectors $v$ on the unit sphere, we can conclude that the supremum is exactly 4.\n\nTherefore, the operator norm of $T$ is 4.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "2327529"}, {"introduction": "Now we move from the discrete world of vectors to the continuous realm of functions.
