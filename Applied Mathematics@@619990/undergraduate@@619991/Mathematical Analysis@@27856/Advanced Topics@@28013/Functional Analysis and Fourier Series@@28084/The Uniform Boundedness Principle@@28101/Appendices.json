The field is described by a continuous function $f(t)$ over a normalized time interval $[0, 1]$. The material's response in the $n$-th harmonic mode, where $n$ is a positive integer, is given by an integrated value over an initial time window. The length of this window, $t_n = 1/a^n$, decreases exponentially with the mode number $n$, where $a > 1$ is a constant related to the material's damping properties. The measurement sensitivity in the $n$-th mode increases exponentially, given by a factor $K^n$, where $K > 1$ is an amplification constant.\n\nThe full model for the response in mode $n$ is thus a linear functional $R_n$ acting on the input field $f$.

Thus $\\|D_h f\\|_{\\infty,h} \\le \\|f'\\|_{\\infty}$, which is a bound independent of $h$. However, the conclusion is false. For the UBP to imply uniform boundedness, pointwise boundedness must hold for *every* function in the Banach space $C[0,1]$, not just for a dense subset.
