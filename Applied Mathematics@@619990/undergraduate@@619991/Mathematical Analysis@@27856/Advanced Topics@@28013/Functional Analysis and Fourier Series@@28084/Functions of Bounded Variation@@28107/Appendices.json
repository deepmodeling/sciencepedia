The total variation measures the total vertical distance traveled by the function. For a continuously differentiable function, this can be found by identifying the intervals where the function is increasing or decreasing.\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of the function $f(x)$:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^3 - 3x) = 3x^2 - 3 $$\nNext, we find the critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero:\n$$ 3x^2 - 3 = 0 $$\n$$ 3(x^2 - 1) = 0 $$\n$$ x^2 = 1 $$\n$$ x = -1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = 1 $$\nBoth critical points, $x=-1$ and $x=1$, lie within the interval $[-2, 2]$.
