Let's choose a sequence of test functions that will lead to a contradiction. Let $\\psi(y)$ be a non-negative smooth bump function with support in $[-1,1]$ and $\\psi(0)=1$. Define $\\phi_n(x) = \\psi(nx)$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}, n \\ge 2$. Then each $\\phi_n$ is a test function in $C^{\\infty}_{c}(\\Omega)$ since its support, $[-1/n, 1/n]$, is a compact subset of $(-1,1)$.\nFor each $\\phi_n$, the condition must hold:\n$$ \\int_{-1}^{1} f^{(3)}(x)\\phi_n(x)dx = 2\\phi_n(0) = 2\\psi(0) = 2 $$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, the function $\\phi_n(x)$ converges pointwise to $0$ for all $x \\neq 0$. The sequence of functions $g_n(x) = f^{(3)}(x)\\phi_n(x)$ is dominated by $|f^{(3)}(x)| \\cdot \\sup|\\psi|$, which is an $L^1$ function. By the Lebesgue Dominated Convergence Theorem:\n$$ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\int_{-1}^{1} f^{(3)}(x)\\phi_n(x)dx = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (f^{(3)}(x)\\phi_n(x))dx = \\int_{-1}^{1} 0 \\, dx = 0 $$\nBut we found that the integral is 2 for every $n$. This leads to the contradiction $2=0$. Therefore, no such function $f^{(3)} \\in L^1(\\Omega)$ exists. The third weak derivative of $f$ is $2\\delta_0$, the Dirac delta distribution, which is not a function in $L^1$.\nSo, $f \\notin W^{3,1}(\\Omega)$. This eliminates option A.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have shown that $f \\in W^{2,1}(\\Omega)$ but $f \\notin W^{3,1}(\\Omega)$.
