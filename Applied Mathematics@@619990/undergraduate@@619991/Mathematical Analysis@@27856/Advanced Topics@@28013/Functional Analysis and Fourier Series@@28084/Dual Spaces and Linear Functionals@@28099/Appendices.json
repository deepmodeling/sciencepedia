For any $t$ in the interval $[0,1]$, both $t$ and $1-t$ are non-negative. Therefore, their product $t(1-t) = t - t^2$ is also non-negative, and thus $|t - t^2| = t - t^2$ for $t \\in [0,1]$.\n\nThe inequality becomes:\n$$ |T(f)| \\le \\int_0^1 (t - t^2) |f(t)| \\, dt $$\nLet's find the maximum value of the function $g(t) = t - t^2$ on the interval $[0,1]$. We can use calculus to find the maximum. The derivative is $g'(t) = 1 - 2t$. Setting the derivative to zero gives $1 - 2t = 0$, which yields $t = 1/2$. This is a critical point within the interval.\nThe value of the function at this point is $g(1/2) = 1/2 - (1/2)^2 = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4$.\nAt the endpoints of the interval, we have $g(0) = 0 - 0^2 = 0$ and $g(1) = 1 - 1^2 = 0$.\nThe maximum value of $t-t^2$ on $[0,1]$ is therefore $1/4$.\n\nSince $t - t^2 \\le 1/4$ for all $t \\in [0,1]$, we can write:\n$$ |T(f)| \\le \\int_0^1 (t - t^2) |f(t)| \\, dt \\le \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{4} |f(t)| \\, dt $$\n$$ |T(f)| \\le \\frac{1}{4} \\int_0^1 |f(t)| \\, dt $$\nBy definition, $\\int_0^1 |f(t)| \\, dt = \\|f\\|_1$.

It implies that the operator norm $\\|T\\|$ must be less than or equal to $1/4$. So, $\\|T\\| \\le 1/4$.\n\nTo show that the norm is exactly $1/4$, we need to prove that this bound is the tightest possible. We can do this by constructing a sequence of functions $(f_n)$ in $C([0,1])$ such that $\\|f_n\\|_1 = 1$ for all $n$, and $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} |T(f_n)| = 1/4$.\n\nLet's consider a sequence of non-negative \"tent\" functions, $f_n(t)$, that become progressively more concentrated around the point $t=1/2$, where the function $t-t^2$ achieves its maximum.\nFor an integer $n \\ge 3$, define $f_n(t)$ as follows:\n- $f_n(t) = 0$ for $t \\in [0, 1/2 - 1/n]$ and $t \\in [1/2 + 1/n, 1]$.\n- On the interval $[1/2 - 1/n, 1/2 + 1/n]$, $f_n(t)$ forms a triangle with its peak at $t=1/2$.\nWe normalize these functions to have an $L^1$-norm of 1. The area under the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. The base is $(1/2 + 1/n) - (1/2 - 1/n) = 2/n$. To make the area equal to 1, the height must be $n$.\nSo, $f_n(1/2) = n$. The function is continuous for each $n$.\n\nNow we evaluate $T(f_n)$. Since $f_n(t) \\ge 0$, we have $|T(f_n)| = T(f_n)$.\n$$ T(f_n) = \\int_0^1 (t - t^2) f_n(t) \\, dt = \\int_{1/2 - 1/n}^{1/2 + 1/n} (t - t^2) f_n(t) \\, dt $$\nSince $f_n(t) \\geq 0$ on its support, we can apply the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals.
