This hub projects a circular field of influence, modeled as an open ball $B(C_H, R)$. To ensure uninterrupted operation for any device that could be powered by the temporary source, the hub's field of influence must completely contain the entire powered region of the temporary source.\n\nWhat is the minimum radius $R$ of the hub's field of influence that satisfies this condition?
