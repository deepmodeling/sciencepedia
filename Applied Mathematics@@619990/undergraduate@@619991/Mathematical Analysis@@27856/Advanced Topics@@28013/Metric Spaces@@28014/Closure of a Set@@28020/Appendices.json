The closure $\\bar{S}$ of a subset $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ can be characterized as the set of all points $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that every open neighborhood of $x$ intersects $S$. Equivalently,\n$$\n\\bar{S}=\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} : \\forall \\epsilon>0,\\ (x-\\epsilon,x+\\epsilon)\\cap S \\neq \\emptyset\\}.\n$$\nHere $S=\\{x \\in \\mathbb{Q}: 0<x<1\\}$.\n\nFirst, we show that every $x \\in (0,1)$ lies in $\\bar{S}$. Let $x \\in (0,1)$ and let $\\epsilon>0$. Since $x \\in (0,1)$, there exists $\\delta>0$ such that $(x-\\delta,x+\\delta) \\subset (0,1)$. Taking $\\eta=\\min\\{\\epsilon,\\delta\\}$ ensures $(x-\\eta,x+\\eta) \\subset (0,1)$. By the density of $\\mathbb{Q}$ in $\\mathbb{R}$, for any $a<b$ there exists $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ with $a<q<b$. Applying this with $a=x-\\eta$ and $b=x+\\eta$ yields a rational $q$ with $x-\\eta<q<x+\\eta$. Because $(x-\\eta,x+\\eta)\\subset (0,1)$, this $q$ satisfies $0<q<1$, hence $q \\in S$, and also $|q-x|<\\epsilon$. Therefore, every neighborhood of $x$ meets $S$, so $x \\in \\bar{S}$. This proves $(0,1) \\subset \\bar{S}$.\n\nNext, we show that $0 \\in \\bar{S}$ and $1 \\in \\bar{S}$. Let $\\epsilon>0$. By the density of $\\mathbb{Q}$ in $\\mathbb{R}$, there exists $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ with $0<q<\\epsilon$. Then $q \\in S$ and $|q-0|<\\epsilon$, so every neighborhood of $0$ meets $S$, implying $0 \\in \\bar{S}$. Similarly, there exists $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ with $1-\\epsilon<q<1$, so $q \\in S$ and $|q-1|<\\epsilon$, hence $1 \\in \\bar{S}$. Therefore $[0,1] \\subset \\bar{S}$.\n\nFinally, we show that no point outside $[0,1]$ lies in $\\bar{S}$. If $x<0$, set $\\epsilon=\\frac{1}{2}|x-0|$.

If $x>1$, set $\\epsilon=\\frac{1}{2}|x-1|$.
