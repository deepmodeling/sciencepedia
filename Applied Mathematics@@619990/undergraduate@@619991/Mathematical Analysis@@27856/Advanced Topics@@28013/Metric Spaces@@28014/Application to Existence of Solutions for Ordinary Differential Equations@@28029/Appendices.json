Continuity of $f(t, y)$ in a region containing $(0, 1)$.\n2.  Lipschitz continuity of $f(t, y)$ with respect to $y$ in that same region.\n\nLet's define a rectangular region $R$ around the point $(0, 1)$:\n$R = \\{(t, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : |t - 0| \\le a, |y - 1| \\le b \\}$ for some positive constants $a$ and $b$. This is the rectangle $R = [-a, a] \\times [1-b, 1+b]$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for continuity of $f(t, y)$ on $R$.**\nThe function $f(t, y) = |t|y$ is a product of two functions: $g(t) = |t|$ and $h(y) = y$.\nThe absolute value function $g(t) = |t|$ is continuous for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe identity function $h(y) = y$ is continuous for all $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe product of two universally continuous functions is itself continuous everywhere on their domain. Thus, $f(t, y) = |t|y$ is continuous on all of $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\nConsequently, $f(t, y)$ is continuous on any rectangle $R$ containing the point $(0, 1)$. The first condition of the theorem is satisfied.\n\n**Step 2: Check for Lipschitz continuity of $f(t, y)$ with respect to $y$ on $R$.**\nWe need to determine if there exists a constant $L  0$ such that for any two points $(t, y_1)$ and $(t, y_2)$ in the rectangle $R$, the following inequality holds:\n$$|f(t, y_1) - f(t, y_2)| \\le L |y_1 - y_2|$$\n\nLet's compute the left-hand side of the inequality:\n$$|f(t, y_1) - f(t, y_2)| = ||t|y_1 - |t|y_2|$$\nFactoring out the common term $|t|$:\n$$ = ||t|(y_1 - y_2)|$$\nUsing the property $|ab| = |a||b|$:\n$$ = |t| |y_1 - y_2|$$\n\nNow we need to find a constant $L$ such that $|t| |y_1 - y_2| \\le L |y_1 - y_2|$. This simplifies to finding an upper bound for $|t|$ within the region $R$.\nBy definition, for any point $(t, y)$ in the rectangle $R = [-a, a] \\times [1-b, 1+b]$, the value of $t$ is restricted to the interval $[-a, a]$. Therefore, for any $t$ in this region, we have $|t| \\le a$.\n\nWe can thus write:\n$$|t| |y_1 - y_2| \\le a |y_1 - y_2|$$\nThis is precisely the Lipschitz condition, with the Lipschitz constant $L = a$. Since we can always choose a positive value for $a$ to define our rectangle $R$, we have shown that $f(t, y)$ is indeed locally Lipschitz continuous with respect to $y$ in a neighborhood of $(0, 1)$. The second condition is also satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a sufficient condition for Lipschitz continuity. If the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}$ is continuous and bounded in the rectangle $R$, then $f$ is Lipschitz in $y$ on $R$.\nLet's compute the partial derivative:\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(|t|y) = |t|$$\nIn the rectangle $R = [-a, a] \\times [1-b, 1+b]$, the function $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = |t|$ is clearly bounded. Its maximum value on $R$ is $a$.\nSince $|\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}| = |t| \\le a$ for all $(t, y) \\in R$, the function $f$ is Lipschitz continuous in $y$ on $R$, with a Lipschitz constant $L = a$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth conditions of the Picard-Lindelöf theorem—continuity of $f(t,y)$ and its local Lipschitz continuity with respect to $y$—are satisfied in a neighborhood of the initial point $(0,1)$.

The theorem does not require $f(t,y)$ to be differentiable with respect to $t$. The non-differentiability of $|t|$ at $t=0$ is irrelevant to the theorem's conditions.\n- C: Incorrect. We have explicitly shown that the function is Lipschitz continuous.\n- D: Incorrect. Continuity alone (as in Peano's existence theorem) guarantees existence, but not uniqueness.

As $y$ approaches $2$, the denominator $\\sqrt{4 - y^2}$ approaches $0$.

Consequently, the Picard-Lindelöf theorem does not guarantee the uniqueness of a solution. This implies that there could be one, more than one, or even infinitely many solutions. We must therefore find the solutions explicitly.\n\nLet's look for solutions.\n**Solution 1: A constant solution.**\nConsider the constant function $y_1(x) = 2$.\nLet's check if it satisfies the conditions.\n- Initial condition: $y_1(0) = 2$. This is satisfied.\n- ODE: The derivative is $y_1'(x) = 0$. Substituting into the ODE: $(y_1')^2 + (y_1)^2 = 0^2 + 2^2 = 4$. This is also satisfied.\nTherefore, $y_1(x) = 2$ is a valid solution.\n\n**Solution 2: A non-constant solution.**\nLet's solve the separable ODE $y' = \\sqrt{4-y^2}$. Note that at the initial point $(0,2)$, $y'=\\sqrt{4-2^2}=0$.\nAssuming $y(x)$ is not constantly $2$, we can separate variables for $|y|2$:\n$$ \\frac{dy}{\\sqrt{4 - y^2}} = dx $$\nIntegrating both sides:\n$$ \\int \\frac{dy}{\\sqrt{4 - y^2}} = \\int dx $$\n$$ \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right) = x + C $$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. We use the initial condition $y(0) = 2$ to find $C$:\n$$ \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{2}{2}\\right) = 0 + C \\implies \\arcsin(1) = C \\implies C = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\nSubstituting $C$ back, we get:\n$$ \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right) = x + \\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\nSolving for $y$:\n$$ \\frac{y}{2} = \\sin\\left(x + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\cos(x) $$\n$$ y_2(x) = 2\\cos(x) $$\nLet's check this solution.\n- Initial condition: $y_2(0) = 2\\cos(0) = 2$. Satisfied.\n- ODE: The derivative is $y_2'(x) = -2\\sin(x)$. Substituting into the ODE: $(y_2')^2 + (y_2)^2 = (-2\\sin(x))^2 + (2\\cos(x))^2 = 4\\sin^2(x) + 4\\cos^2(x) = 4(\\sin^2(x) + \\cos^2(x)) = 4$. Satisfied.\nThus, $y_2(x) = 2\\cos(x)$ is another distinct solution. (If we were to solve $y'=-\\sqrt{4-y^2}$, we would arrive at the same solution $y(x)=2\\cos(x)$).\n\nWe have already found two distinct solutions: $y_1(x) = 2$ and $y_2(x) = 2\\cos(x)$. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n**Existence of more solutions:**\nThe failure of the Lipschitz condition at $y=2$ allows for the possibility of \"stitching\" together different solutions at points where their values and derivatives match.\nBoth solutions $y_1(x) = 2$ and $y_2(x) = 2\\cos(x)$ pass through $(0, 2)$, and their derivatives are both zero at this point ($y_1'(0)=0$ and $y_2'(0)=-2\\sin(0)=0$). This allows us to construct new, distinct solutions.\n\nFor example, consider the function $y_3(x)$ defined as:\n$$ y_3(x) = \\begin{cases} 2\\cos(x)  \\text{for } x \\le 0 \\\\ 2  \\text{for } x  0 \\end{cases} $$\n- Initial condition: $y_3(0) = 2\\cos(0) = 2$. Satisfied.\n- ODE: The function is made of pieces of valid solutions.\n- Differentiability: We must check for continuous differentiability at the stitch point, $x=0$.\n  - Continuity: $\\lim_{x\\to 0^-} y_3(x) = \\lim_{x\\to 0^-} 2\\cos(x) = 2$. And $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} y_3(x) = \\lim_{x\\to 0^+} 2 = 2$. The function is continuous.\n  - Derivative continuity: The left-hand derivative is $\\frac{d}{dx}(2\\cos(x))|_{x=0} = -2\\sin(0) = 0$. The right-hand derivative is $\\frac{d}{dx}(2)|_{x=0} = 0$. Since the left and right derivatives match, the function is continuously differentiable.\nThis function $y_3(x)$ is a third distinct solution.\n\nWe can generalize this construction. The two basic solutions $y=2$ and $y=2\\cos(x)$ meet with the same value and derivative at all points $x=2k\\pi$ for any integer $k$. We can \"switch\" from one solution to another at any of these points.\nFor any real number $a  0$, we can define a solution:\n$$ y_a(x) = \\begin{cases} 2  \\text{for } x \\in [0, 2\\pi a] \\\\ 2\\cos(x)  \\text{for } x  0 \\\\ 2\\cos(x)  \\text{for } x  2\\pi a \\end{cases} $$\nThis function is built by starting on the cosine solution, switching to the constant solution at $x=0$, staying there until $x=2\\pi a$, and then switching back to the cosine curve. Each choice of a distinct positive `a` produces a new, unique, continuously differentiable solution passing through $(0,2)$. Since there are infinitely many choices for $a0$, there are infinitely many distinct solutions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that there are infinitely many solutions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2288403"}]}
