We can use topological invariants—properties unchanged by such transformations—to show two spaces are fundamentally different, without having to test every possible function. This thought experiment uses the idea of 'cut-points' to demonstrate why a simple line segment can never be topologically equivalent to a more complex shape like a figure-eight, revealing the power of qualitative analysis in topology. [@problem_id:2301571]", "problem": "Let $X$ be the \"figure-eight\" space, which is topologically defined as the union of two circles identified at a single, common point. Let $S$ be a non-empty subset of the real line $\\mathbb{R}$. A fundamental result in topology states that if $S$ were homeomorphic to $X$, they would share certain topological invariants. Since $X$ is a compact and connected space, any space $S$ homeomorphic to it must also be compact and connected. A non-empty, compact, connected subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ is a closed interval of the form $[a, b]$ where $a  b$.\n\nTo investigate the theoretical possibility of such a homeomorphism, we can analyze the \"cut-points\" of each space. For a given topological space $T$, we define two quantities:\n- Let $N_1(T)$ be the number of points $p \\in T$ such that the space $T \\setminus \\{p\\}$ (i.e., $T$ with the point $p$ removed) is connected (has exactly one connected component).\n- Let $N_2(T)$ be the number of points $p \\in T$ such that $T \\setminus \\{p\\}$ has exactly two connected components.\n\nIf a homeomorphism existed between $X$ and $S=[a,b]$, it would be necessary that $N_1(X) = N_1(S)$ and $N_2(X) = N_2(S)$.

To achieve this, we must first determine the values of $N_1(S)$ and $N_2(X)$ by analyzing the topological properties of the given spaces.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the figure-eight space, $X$. This space can be visualized as two loops joined at a single point. Let's call this junction point the central point, $p_c$. We need to find $N_2(X)$, the number of points whose removal disconnects the space into exactly two components.\nConsider removing a point $p$ from $X$.\nIf we remove the central point, $p = p_c$, the two loops become entirely separate. Each loop, with one point removed, is homeomorphic to an open interval and is thus connected. Therefore, the space $X \\setminus \\{p_c\\}$ consists of two connected components.\nIf we remove any other point $p \\neq p_c$, the point $p$ lies on only one of the two loops. The remainder of that loop is an arc that is still connected to the other, complete loop at the central point $p_c$. The union of these two sets (the arc and the complete loop), which share a common point $p_c$, is a connected space. Thus, for any $p \\neq p_c$, the space $X \\setminus \\{p\\}$ remains connected (i.e., has one connected component).\nFrom this analysis, we conclude that there is only one point in $X$ whose removal results in two connected components, namely the central point $p_c$. Therefore, $N_2(X) = 1$.\n\nNext, we analyze the space $S$, which is a closed interval $[a, b]$ with $a  b$. We need to find $N_1(S)$, the number of points whose removal leaves the space connected.\nConsider removing a point $s$ from $S$.\nIf we remove an interior point $s \\in (a, b)$, the resulting space is $S \\setminus \\{s\\} = [a, s) \\cup (s, b]$. This is the union of two disjoint intervals, which means the space is disconnected and has two connected components.\nIf we remove one of the endpoints, either $a$ or $b$, the resulting space is $(a, b]$ or $[a, b)$, respectively. Both of these are intervals and are therefore connected spaces.\nThus, there are exactly two points in $S$ whose removal leaves the space connected: the endpoints $a$ and $b$. Therefore, $N_1(S) = 2$.\n\nFinally, we can compute the value of $\\Delta$. The definition is given as $\\Delta = N_1(S) - N_2(X)$.\nSubstituting the values we have found:\n$$ \\Delta = 2 - 1 = 1 $$\nThis result highlights a fundamental topological difference between a closed interval and a figure-eight space. Since a homeomorphism must preserve the number of cut-points of each type (i.e., it would require $N_1(X) = N_1(S)$ and $N_2(X) = N_2(S)$), and we can see that $N_1(S)=2$ while $N_1(X)=\\infty$, and $N_2(S)=\\infty$ while $N_2(X)=1$, no such homeomorphism can exist.
