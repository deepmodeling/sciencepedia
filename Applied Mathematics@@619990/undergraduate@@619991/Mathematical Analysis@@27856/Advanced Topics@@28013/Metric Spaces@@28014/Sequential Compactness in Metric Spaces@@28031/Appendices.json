A subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ is sequentially compact if and only if it is closed and bounded (this is the Heine-Borel Theorem). We will investigate whether Property M implies that a set must be closed and bounded.\n\n**Step 1: Does Property M imply the set is bounded?**\n\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that a set $S$ has Property M but is not bounded. If $S$ is not bounded, it must be either unbounded above, unbounded below, or both.\n\nCase 1: $S$ is not bounded above.\nConsider the function $f(x) = x$. This function is continuous on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, and therefore is continuous on the subset $S$. Since $S$ is not bounded above, for any real number $M$, there exists an element $s \\in S$ such that $s > M$. This means the function $f(x) = x$ is not bounded above on $S$. A function that is not bounded above cannot attain a maximum value. This contradicts the assumption that $S$ has Property M.\n\nCase 2: $S$ is not bounded below.\nConsider the function $g(x) = -x$. This function is also continuous on all of $\\mathbb{R}$ and thus on $S$. Since $S$ is not bounded below, for any real number $N$, there exists an element $s \\in S$ such that $s < N$. This implies $-s > -N$, so $g(s) > -N$. This means the function $g(x) = -x$ is not bounded above on $S$. Therefore, it cannot attain a maximum value. This again contradicts the assumption that $S$ has Property M.\n\nSince both cases lead to a contradiction, our initial assumption must be false. Therefore, any set $S$ with Property M must be bounded.\n\n**Step 2: Does Property M imply the set is closed?**\n\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that a set $S$ has Property M but is not closed. If $S$ is not closed, then by definition, there exists at least one limit point of $S$ that is not in $S$. Let's call such a limit point $x_0$. So, $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a limit point of $S$, but $x_0 \\notin S$.\n\nConsider the function $h(x) = \\frac{1}{|x - x_0|}$. This function is defined for all $x \\neq x_0$. Since $x_0 \\notin S$, the function $h(x)$ is well-defined and continuous for all $x \\in S$.\n\nBecause $x_0$ is a limit point of $S$, there exists a sequence of points $(s_n)_{n=1}^\\infty$ in $S$ such that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} s_n = x_0$.\nNow let's examine the behavior of our function $h(x)$ along this sequence.\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} h(s_n) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{|s_n - x_0|} $$\nAs $s_n \\to x_0$, the denominator $|s_n - x_0| \\to 0$ (through positive values). Therefore, the expression for $h(s_n)$ tends to infinity.\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} h(s_n) = \\infty $$\nThis means the function $h$ is not bounded above on $S$, and consequently, it cannot attain a maximum value. This contradicts the assumption that $S$ has Property M.\n\nSo, our assumption that $S$ is not closed must be false. Therefore, any set $S$ with Property M must be closed.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion and Evaluation of Options**\n\nFrom Step 1 and Step 2, we have proven that if a non-empty set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ has Property M, it must be both closed and bounded. By the Heine-Borel Theorem for $\\mathbb{R}$, a set is sequentially compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. Thus, any set $S$ with Property M must be sequentially compact.\n\nThis confirms that statement A is true. Let's briefly examine why the other options are false.\n\nB. This statement is false. We proved that $S$ must be closed. For the specific example $S=(0,1)$, consider the continuous function $f(x) = x$. The supremum of $f$ on $S$ is 1, but this value is never attained for any $x \\in (0,1)$. So $(0,1)$ does not have Property M.\n\nC. This statement is false. We proved that $S$ must be bounded. For the specific example $S=\\mathbb{Z}$ (the set of integers), the function $f(x)=x$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{Z}$ but is unbounded above, so it does not attain a maximum. Thus $\\mathbb{Z}$ does not have Property M.\n\nD. This statement is false. It claims \"if and only if\". The reverse direction is true (a single point set is compact, so it has Property M). However, the forward direction is false. Consider the set $S=[0,1]$. This set is closed and bounded, hence compact. By the Extreme Value Theorem, any continuous function on $[0,1]$ attains its maximum. So, $S=[0,1]$ has Property M, but it is not a single point.\n\nE. This statement is also false. It claims \"if and only if\". Any finite set is closed and bounded, hence compact, and thus has Property M. But the counterexample from D, $S=[0,1]$, has Property M and is an infinite set.\n\nTherefore, the only true statement is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1321791"}, {"introduction": "The principles of analysis can be applied to spaces far more abstract than the real number line.
