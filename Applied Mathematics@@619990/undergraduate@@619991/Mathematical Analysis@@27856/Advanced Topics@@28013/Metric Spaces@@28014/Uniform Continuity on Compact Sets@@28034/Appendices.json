This constant $C$ is the Lipschitz constant of $g$ on $K$.\n\nFirst, let's express the term $|g(x) - g(y)|$ in terms of $f(x)$ and $f(y)$:\n$$\n|g(x) - g(y)| = \\left|\\frac{1}{f(x)} - \\frac{1}{f(y)}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{f(y) - f(x)}{f(x)f(y)}\\right| = \\frac{|f(x) - f(y)|}{f(x)f(y)}\n$$\nTo find an upper bound for this expression in the form $C|x-y|$, we need to find an upper bound for the numerator $|f(x) - f(y)|$ and a lower bound for the denominator $f(x)f(y)$.\n\nLet's start with the denominator. The function $f(x)$ is continuous on the compact set $K=[0,4]$. By the Extreme Value Theorem, $f(x)$ must attain its minimum value on $K$. Let this minimum value be $m = \\min_{x \\in K} f(x)$.\nTo find $m$, we first find the critical points of $f(x)$ by taking its derivative and setting it to zero:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 - 6x + 13) = 2x - 6\n$$\nSetting $f'(x) = 0$ gives $2x - 6 = 0$, so $x = 3$. Since $3 \\in [0, 4]$, this is a critical point within our domain.\nNow we evaluate $f(x)$ at the critical point and at the endpoints of the interval $[0, 4]$:\n- At the critical point $x=3$: $f(3) = (3)^2 - 6(3) + 13 = 9 - 18 + 13 = 4$.\n- At the left endpoint $x=0$: $f(0) = (0)^2 - 6(0) + 13 = 13$.\n- At the right endpoint $x=4$: $f(4) = (4)^2 - 6(4) + 13 = 16 - 24 + 13 = 5$.\nComparing these values, the minimum value of $f(x)$ on $K$ is $m=4$.\nSince $f(x) \\ge m = 4$ for all $x \\in K$, we have $f(x)f(y) \\ge m^2 = 4^2 = 16$.\nThis gives a lower bound for the denominator:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{f(x)f(y)} \\le \\frac{1}{m^2} = \\frac{1}{16}\n$$\n\nNext, let's find an upper bound for the numerator, $|f(x) - f(y)|$. Since $f$ is continuously differentiable, we can use the Mean Value Theorem. For any $x, y \\in K$ with $x \\neq y$, there exists a point $c$ between $x$ and $y$ such that:\n$$\n\\frac{f(x) - f(y)}{x - y} = f'(c)\n$$\nThis implies $|f(x) - f(y)| = |f'(c)||x-y|$. To get a uniform upper bound, we need to find the maximum value of $|f'(c)|$ for any $c \\in K = [0, 4]$. Let this maximum value be $L = \\max_{c \\in [0,4]} |f'(c)|$.\nWe have $f'(c) = 2c - 6$. We need to find the maximum of $|2c - 6|$ on the interval $[0, 4]$.\nLet's check the endpoints of the interval for the function $h(c) = 2c-6$:\n- At $c=0$: $|h(0)| = |2(0) - 6| = |-6| = 6$.\n- At $c=4$: $|h(4)| = |2(4) - 6| = |8 - 6| = 2$.\nThe function $h(c)=2c-6$ is linear, so its maximum absolute value on a closed interval must occur at an endpoint. Comparing the values, the maximum value is $L=6$.\nTherefore, for any $x, y \\in K$, we have $|f(x) - f(y)| \\le L|x-y| = 6|x-y|$.\n\nNow, we can combine the bounds for the numerator and the denominator:\n$$\n|g(x) - g(y)| = \\frac{|f(x) - f(y)|}{f(x)f(y)} \\le \\frac{L|x-y|}{m^2}\n$$\nSubstituting the values we found for $L$ and $m$:\n$$\n|g(x) - g(y)| \\le \\frac{6|x-y|}{16} = \\frac{3}{8}|x-y|\n$$\nThis shows that $C=3/8$ is a valid Lipschitz constant for $g(x)$ on $K$. The method used, which bounds the expression by the maximum of the derivative of the numerator and the minimum of the denominator, finds the smallest such constant, which is the exact Lipschitz constant for $g$.\nThus, the smallest possible value for $C$ is $3/8$.
