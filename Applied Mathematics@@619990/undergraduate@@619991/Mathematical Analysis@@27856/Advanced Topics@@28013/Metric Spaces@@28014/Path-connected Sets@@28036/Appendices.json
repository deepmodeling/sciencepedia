This is a question about the path-connectedness of the robot's operational space. A space is path-connected if for any two points in the space, there exists a continuous path connecting them that lies entirely within the space. If a space is not path-connected, there exist pairs of points for which no such path can be found.\n\nThe operational space in each scenario is $\\mathbb{R}^N \\setminus \\{Q\\}$, which is the N-dimensional Euclidean space with a single point $Q$ removed.\n\nLet's analyze each scenario:\n\n**General Case for $N \\ge 2$ (Scenarios A, B, and D):**\nConsider a space $\\mathbb{R}^N$ where $N \\ge 2$, with a point $Q$ removed. Let $P_i$ and $P_f$ be any two distinct points in this space, $\\mathbb{R}^N \\setminus \\{Q\\}$.\nA candidate for a path is the straight line segment connecting $P_i$ and $P_f$, given by the parameterization $\\gamma(t) = (1-t)P_i + tP_f$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$.\nCase 1: The point $Q$ does not lie on this line segment. In this case, the straight line segment itself is a valid path, as it lies entirely within the operational space $\\mathbb{R}^N \\setminus \\{Q\\}$.\nCase 2: The point $Q$ lies on the line segment connecting $P_i$ and $P_f$. Since the dimension $N$ is 2 or greater, the space is not restricted to a single line. We can always \"go around\" the point $Q$. To construct an explicit path, we can find a third point $M$ that is in the space $\\mathbb{R}^N \\setminus \\{Q\\}$ but not on the line passing through $P_i$ and $P_f$. Since $N \\ge 2$, such a point $M$ always exists. For example, in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, we can pick a point anywhere off the line. Then, the path can be formed by two straight line segments: one from $P_i$ to $M$, and another from $M$ to $P_f$. The segment from $P_i$ to $M$ does not contain $Q$ (since $M$ is not on the line containing $P_i, P_f, Q$), and the segment from $M$ to $P_f$ also does not contain $Q$. The concatenation of these two segments forms a continuous path from $P_i$ to $P_f$ that avoids $Q$.\nTherefore, for any $N \\ge 2$, the space $\\mathbb{R}^N \\setminus \\{Q\\}$ is path-connected. This means a path is always guaranteed to exist.\n\n*   **Scenario A:** The space is $\\mathbb{R}^3 \\setminus \\{(0, 0, 0)\\}$. Here $N=3 \\ge 2$. Based on the general argument, this space is path-connected. Even though $P_i = (1, 2, 3)$ and $P_f = (-1, -2, -3)$ are collinear with the origin $Q = (0, 0, 0)$, a path can be found by detouring around the origin. A path is guaranteed.\n\n*   **Scenario B:** The space is $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{(1, 1)\\}$. Here $N=2 \\ge 2$. This space is path-connected. The points $P_i = (0, 0)$ and $P_f = (2, 2)$ are collinear with $Q = (1, 1)$, but a path can be constructed that avoids $Q$, for example, by using a semi-circular arc around $Q$.

The points $P_i = (5, 0, 0, 0)$ and $P_f = (-5, 0, 0, 0)$ are collinear with $Q = (1, 0, 0, 0)$, but the four dimensions provide ample room to construct a path around $Q$. A path is guaranteed.\n\n**Scenario C:**\nThe space is $\\mathbb{R}^1 \\setminus \\{0\\}$. This is the real number line with the origin removed. This space can be expressed as the union of two disjoint open sets: $S_1 = (-\\infty, 0)$ and $S_2 = (0, \\infty)$. These are the two connected components of the space.\nThe initial position is $P_i = -1$, which lies in $S_1$.\nThe final position is $P_f = 1$, which lies in $S_2$.\nA continuous path from $P_i$ to $P_f$ must be a continuous function $\\gamma: [0, 1] \\to \\mathbb{R}^1 \\setminus \\{0\\}$ with $\\gamma(0) = -1$ and $\\gamma(1) = 1$.\nThe domain $[0,1]$ is a connected set. The continuous image of a connected set is connected. In $\\mathbb{R}^1$, the connected sets are intervals. The image of the path, $\\gamma([0, 1])$, must therefore be an interval containing its start and end points, $-1$ and $1$. Any interval containing $-1$ and $1$ must also contain the entire segment $[-1, 1]$, including the point $0$.\nThis means that for some $t \\in (0, 1)$, we must have $\\gamma(t) = 0$. However, the point $0$ is the 'no-go' zone and is explicitly excluded from the operational space. This is a contradiction. Therefore, no such continuous path can exist within the space $\\mathbb{R}^1 \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\nIn this scenario, it is not possible for the robot to travel from $P_i = -1$ to $P_f = 1$.
