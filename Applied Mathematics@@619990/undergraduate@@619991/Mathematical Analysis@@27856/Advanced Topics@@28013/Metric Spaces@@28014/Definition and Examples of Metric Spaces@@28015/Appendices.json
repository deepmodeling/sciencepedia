A function $d: X \\times X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is called a metric on a set $X$ if for all $x, y, z \\in X$, it satisfies the following four axioms:\n1.  Non-negativity: $d(x, y) \\ge 0$\n2.

Identity of indiscernibles holds because $|x-y|^{\\alpha}=0$ if and only if $|x-y|=0$, which is equivalent to $x=y$. Symmetry holds since $|x-y|=|y-x|$, hence $|x-y|^{\\alpha}=|y-x|^{\\alpha}$.\n\nIt remains to verify the triangle inequality. Let $x,y,z\\in\\mathbb{R}$ and set $a=|x-y|$ and $b=|y-z|$, so that $|x-z|\\le a+b$ by the usual triangle inequality on $\\mathbb{R}$.
