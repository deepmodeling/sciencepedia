Therefore, $||x^{(m)} - x^{(n)}||_{\\infty} < \\epsilon$, and the sequence $(x^{(n)})_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ is a Cauchy sequence.\n\nNext, we check for convergence in $c_{00}$. Suppose the sequence converges to a limit $L \\in c_{00}$, i.e., $x^{(n)} \\to L$. Convergence in the supremum norm implies pointwise convergence. This means that for each fixed component $k$, the sequence of real numbers $(x^{(n)}_k)_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ must converge to $L_k$.\nFor a fixed $k$, the sequence of the $k$-th components is $(x^{(1)}_k, x^{(2)}_k, x^{(3)}_k, \\dots)$. By definition of $x^{(n)}$, for any $n \\ge k$, the $k$-th component is $x^{(n)}_k = \\frac{1}{k}$. Thus, the sequence $(x^{(n)}_k)_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ is eventually constant and equal to $\\frac{1}{k}$.\nThe limit is therefore $L_k = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} x^{(n)}_k = \\frac{1}{k}$.\nThis must hold for all $k \\ge 1$. So, the candidate limit is the sequence $L = \\left(1, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\dots, \\frac{1}{k}, \\dots\\right)$.\nThis sequence $L$ has infinitely many non-zero terms. Therefore, it is not an eventually zero sequence, which means $L \\notin c_{00}$. Since the sequence has a pointwise limit that is not in $c_{00}$, it cannot converge to any element within $c_{00}$. Thus, the sequence $(x^{(n)})_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ does not converge in $c_{00}$.\nThis option describes a Cauchy sequence that does not converge in $c_{00}$.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\nThe sequence is given by $x^{(n)} = \\left(\\frac{1}{n}, \\frac{1}{n}, \\dots, \\frac{1}{n}, 0, \\dots\\right)$.\nLet's check if this sequence converges. Consider the zero sequence $0 = (0, 0, 0, \\dots)$, which is clearly in $c_{00}$. The distance from $x^{(n)}$ to the zero sequence is:\n$$ ||x^{(n)} - 0||_{\\infty} = ||x^{(n)}||_{\\infty} = \\sup\\left\\{\\left|\\frac{1}{n}\\right|, \\dots, \\left|\\frac{1}{n}\\right|\\right\\} = \\frac{1}{n} $$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, $||x^{(n)}||_{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{n} \\to 0$. This means the sequence $(x^{(n)})_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ converges to the zero sequence. Since every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence, this is a Cauchy sequence that converges in $c_{00}$. This is not the correct answer.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThe sequence is given by $x^{(n)} = (1, 1, \\dots, 1, 0, \\dots)$.\nTo check if it's a Cauchy sequence, let's consider the distance between consecutive terms. Let $n \\ge 1$.\n$$ x^{(n+1)} - x^{(n)} = (0, \\dots, 0, 1, 0, \\dots) = e_{n+1} $$\nThe norm of the difference is:\n$$ ||x^{(n+1)} - x^{(n)}||_{\\infty} = ||e_{n+1}||_{\\infty} = 1 $$\nSince the distance between consecutive terms is always 1, it does not approach 0 as $n \\to \\infty$. So, for $\\epsilon = 1/2$, we can never find an $N$ such that for $m, n > N$, $||x^{(m)} - x^{(n)}||_{\\infty} < 1/2$. Therefore, the sequence is not a Cauchy sequence.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nThe sequence is given by $x^{(n)} = \\left(0, \\dots, 0, \\frac{1}{n}, 0, \\dots\\right) = \\frac{1}{n}e_n$.\nLet's check for convergence to the zero sequence $0 = (0, 0, \\dots) \\in c_{00}$.\n$$ ||x^{(n)} - 0||_{\\infty} = ||x^{(n)}||_{\\infty} = \\left|\\frac{1}{n}\\right| = \\frac{1}{n} $$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, $||x^{(n)}||_{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{n} \\to 0$.

Therefore, the 5-adic valuation is:\n$$v_5\\left(\\sum_{k=n+1}^{m} 2 \\cdot 5^k\\right) = n+1$$\nThe distance is then $d_5(x_m, x_n) = 5^{-(n+1)}$. As $n \\to \\infty$, this distance approaches 0. Thus, the sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(\\mathbb{Q}, d_5)$.\n\nSince $\\mathbb{Q}_5$ is the completion of $(\\mathbb{Q}, d_5)$, every Cauchy sequence of rational numbers converges to a limit in $\\mathbb{Q}_5$. In a complete non-Archimedean field like $\\mathbb{Q}_5$, a geometric series $\\sum a r^k$ converges if its \"norm\" $|r|_p < 1$. Here, the ratio is $r=5$, and the 5-adic norm is $|5|_5 = d_5(5,0) = 5^{-v_5(5)} = 5^{-1}$. Since $|5|_5 < 1$, the series converges. The sum of a convergent geometric series is given by the formula $S = \\frac{a}{1-r}$, where $a$ is the first term.\nThe limit $L$ is:\n$$L = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} 2 \\cdot 5^k = \\frac{2}{1-5} = \\frac{2}{-4} = -\\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe limit $L = -1/2$ is a rational number.

Let's examine if there exists a number $i_5 \\in \\mathbb{Q}_5$ such that $(i_5)^2 = -1$. If such a number exists, then we would have $-1 > 0$. However, we also know $1 = 1^2 > 0$. It is a property of ordered fields that if $a>0$, then $-a<0$. So if $1>0$, then $-1<0$, leading to a contradiction.\nTo see if $(i_5)^2=-1$ has a solution in $\\mathbb{Q}_5$, we can use Hensel's Lemma for the polynomial $f(x) = x^2+1$. We seek a root modulo 5. The equation $x^2+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 5$ is equivalent to $x^2 \\equiv -1 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 5$. This has solutions $x_0 = 2$ and $x_0 = 3$. Let's choose $x_0 = 2$.\nThe derivative is $f'(x) = 2x$. At $x_0=2$, we have $f'(2) = 4$. Since $f'(2) \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod 5$, Hensel's Lemma guarantees that the solution $x_0=2$ can be lifted to a unique solution for $x^2+1=0$ in the ring of 5-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_5$, and thus in $\\mathbb{Q}_5$.\nSince $\\mathbb{Q}_5$ contains a square root of -1, it cannot be an ordered field. Therefore, statement B is false.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThis statement claims that any 5-adic number not in $\\mathbb{Q}$ is transcendental. A number is transcendental over $\\mathbb{Q}$ if it is not a root of any non-zero polynomial with rational coefficients.\nFrom the analysis of option B, we know there is an element $i_5 \\in \\mathbb{Q}_5$ that is a root of the polynomial $f(x) = x^2+1$. By definition, this number $i_5$ is an algebraic number over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The equation $x^2 = -1$ has no solution in the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, so $i_5 \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$.\nWe have found an element $i_5 \\in \\mathbb{Q}_5 \\setminus \\mathbb{Q}$ which is algebraic. This serves as a counterexample to the statement. Therefore, statement C is false.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nThis statement claims the 5-adic topology on $\\mathbb{Q}_5$ is the same as the standard Euclidean topology inherited from $\\mathbb{R}$. Two topologies are the same if and only if they have the same convergent sequences.\nConsider the sequence $a_n = 5^n$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. In the 5-adic metric, the distance to 0 is:\n$$d_5(5^n, 0) = 5^{-v_5(5^n)} = 5^{-n}$$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, $d_5(5^n, 0) \\to 0$. So, the sequence $\\{5^n\\}$ converges to 0 in $\\mathbb{Q}_5$.\nIn the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}$, the sequence $\\{5^n\\}$ diverges to infinity.\nSince this sequence behaves differently in the two topologies, the topologies are not the same. Therefore, statement D is false.\n\n**Analysis of Option E:**\nThis statement claims the set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ is dense in $\\mathbb{Q}_5$. For a set to be dense, any point in the space must be a limit of a sequence of points from the set. Equivalently, for any point $y \\in \\mathbb{Q}_5$ and any $\\epsilon > 0$, there must be an element $z \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $\\hat{d}_5(y, z) < \\epsilon$.\nLet's choose the point $y = 1/5$, which is in $\\mathbb{Q}$ and thus in $\\mathbb{Q}_5$. Let's compute the distance from an arbitrary integer $z \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ to $y=1/5$:\n$$d_5(z, 1/5) = 5^{-v_5(z - 1/5)} = 5^{-v_5((5z-1)/5)}$$\nUsing the property $v_p(x/y) = v_p(x) - v_p(y)$, we get:\n$$d_5(z, 1/5) = 5^{-(v_5(5z-1) - v_5(5))}$$\nSince $z$ is an integer, $5z$ is a multiple of 5, so $5z-1$ is not divisible by 5. This means $v_5(5z-1) = 0$. Also, $v_5(5) = 1$.\nThe valuation is $v_5(z - 1/5) = 0 - 1 = -1$.\nSo, the distance is $d_5(z, 1/5) = 5^{-(-1)} = 5$.\nThis means that for any integer $z$, the distance from $z$ to $1/5$ is exactly 5. We cannot find any integer that is, for instance, in the open ball of radius 1 around $1/5$. Thus, $\\mathbb{Z}$ is not dense in $\\mathbb{Q}_5$.
