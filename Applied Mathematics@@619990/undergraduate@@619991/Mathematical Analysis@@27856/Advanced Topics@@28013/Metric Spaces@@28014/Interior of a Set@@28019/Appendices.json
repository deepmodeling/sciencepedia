By definition, a counterexample must satisfy two properties:\n1) $S$ is connected.\n2) $\\text{Int}(S)$ is not connected; in particular, it must be the union of at least two disjoint nonempty open sets.\n\nI examine each option.\n\nFor set A:\nLet $D_{-2}=\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}:(x+2)^{2}+y^{2}\\leq 1\\}$, $D_{2}=\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}:(x-2)^{2}+y^{2}\\leq 1\\}$, and $L=\\{(x,0):-1\\leq x\\leq 1\\}$. Each of $D_{-2},D_{2},L$ is connected. Moreover, $L$ intersects each disk: indeed, $(-1,0)\\in D_{-2}\\cap L$ since $(-1+2)^{2}+0^{2}=1$, and $(1,0)\\in D_{2}\\cap L$ since $(1-2)^{2}+0^{2}=1$. A standard fact states that a union of connected sets that intersect successively in a chain is connected; hence $A=D_{-2}\\cup L\\cup D_{2}$ is connected.\n\nNext, compute $\\text{Int}(A)$. The line segment $L$ has empty interior in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The only points of $A$ that can have open neighborhoods contained in $A$ are those points that lie strictly inside one of the two disks. Hence\n$$\n\\text{Int}(A)=\\{(x,y):(x+2)^{2}+y^{2}<1\\}\\cup\\{(x,y):(x-2)^{2}+y^{2}<1\\}.\n$$\nThese two open disks are disjoint: if a point were in both, it would be within distance less than $1$ of both $(-2,0)$ and $(2,0)$, which by the triangle inequality would imply $d((-2,0),(2,0))2$, contradicting $d((-2,0),(2,0))=4$. Therefore $\\text{Int}(A)$ is the union of two disjoint nonempty open sets, hence is disconnected. Thus A is a counterexample.\n\nFor set B:\nLet $S=\\{(x,\\sin(1/x)):0x\\leq 1\\}$. The map $x\\mapsto (x,\\sin(1/x))$ is continuous on the connected interval $(0,1]$, so $S$ is connected. The set $B$ is the closure of $S$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, since the added set $\\{(0,y):-1\\leq y\\leq 1\\}$ is exactly the set of limit points on $x=0$. The closure of a connected set is connected, so $B$ is connected. Its interior is empty because around any point in $B$ any open ball contains points with the same $x$-coordinate but $y$-coordinate not matching the graph or the vertical segment, so no point has a neighborhood contained in $B$. Hence $\\text{Int}(B)=\\varnothing$, which is connected. Therefore B is not a counterexample.\n\nFor set C:\nIt is the union of two closed disks centered at $(-2,0)$ and $(2,0)$ of radius $1$. These are disjoint by the same triangle inequality argument as above, so $C$ is disconnected and fails the hypothesis. Hence C is not a counterexample.\n\nFor set D:\nThe closed unit disk $\\{(x,y):x^{2}+y^{2}\\leq 1\\}$ is convex, hence path-connected and therefore connected. Its interior is the open unit disk $\\{(x,y):x^{2}+y^{2}1\\}$, which is also path-connected and hence connected. Thus D is not a counterexample.\n\nFor set E:\nLet $H=\\{(x,0):0\\leq x\\leq 1\\}$ and for each $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ let $V_{n}=\\{(1/n,y):0\\leq y\\leq 1\\}$ and $V_{0}=\\{(0,y):0\\leq y\\leq 1\\}$. Each $H,V_{n},V_{0}$ is connected. Moreover, $V_{n}\\cap H=\\{(1/n,0)\\}\\neq\\varnothing$ for all $n$, and $V_{0}\\cap H=\\{(0,0)\\}\\neq\\varnothing$. Therefore the union $E=H\\cup\\bigcup_{n=0}^{\\infty}V_{n}$ is connected as a union of connected sets all intersecting $H$. Its interior is empty, since it is a countable union of line segments in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$; for any point in $E$, any open ball contains points with $x$ not equal to $0$ or $1/n$ and with $y0$, which are not in $E$.
