A common method to prove that a space is not separable is to find an uncountable collection of non-empty, pairwise disjoint open sets. If such a collection exists, any dense subset would need to contain at least one point from each of these open sets, forcing the dense subset to be uncountable.\n\nLet's employ this strategy. Consider the set of points on the Euclidean unit circle, $C = \\{ p \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid \\|p\\| = 1 \\}$. This set $C$ is uncountable.\n\nFor each point $p \\in C$, let us consider the open ball with center $p$ and radius $r=1/2$, defined as $B(p, 1/2) = \\{ q \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid d_{HS}(p, q)  1/2 \\}$.\n\nLet's analyze the composition of such an open ball for a given $p \\in C$. A point $q \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ can either be collinear with $p$ and the origin $O$, or not.\n\nCase 1: $q$ is not collinear with $p$ and $O$.\nIn this case, the distance is $d_{HS}(p, q) = \\|p\\| + \\|q\\|$. Since $p \\in C$, we have $\\|p\\|=1$. So, $d_{HS}(p, q) = 1 + \\|q\\|$. As the Euclidean norm $\\|q\\|$ is always non-negative, $d_{HS}(p, q) \\ge 1$. Since we are considering the ball of radius $1/2$, no point $q$ that is not collinear with $p$ and $O$ can be in $B(p, 1/2)$.\n\nCase 2: $q$ is collinear with $p$ and $O$.\nIn this case, the distance is the Euclidean distance, $d_{HS}(p, q) = \\|p-q\\|$. The condition for $q$ to be in the ball $B(p, 1/2)$ is $\\|p-q\\|  1/2$.\nThis means that the open ball $B(p, 1/2)$ consists exclusively of points $q$ that lie on the line passing through the origin and $p$, and are within a Euclidean distance of $1/2$ from $p$.\n\nNow, let's consider two distinct points $p_1, p_2 \\in C$. We want to show that their corresponding open balls, $B(p_1, 1/2)$ and $B(p_2, 1/2)$, are disjoint.\nThe ball $B(p_1, 1/2)$ is a subset of the line $L_1$ that passes through $O$ and $p_1$.\nThe ball $B(p_2, 1/2)$ is a subset of the line $L_2$ that passes through $O$ and $p_2$.\nSince $p_1$ and $p_2$ are distinct points on the unit circle, the lines $L_1$ and $L_2$ are distinct. The only point of intersection between $L_1$ and $L_2$ is the origin $O$.\n\nCould the origin $O$ be in any of these balls? Let's check the distance from a point $p \\in C$ to the origin $O$. Since $p$ and $O$ are collinear (any two points define a line, and the third point is on it), we use the Euclidean distance: $d_{HS}(p, O) = \\|p-O\\| = \\|p\\| = 1$. Since $1 > 1/2$, the origin $O$ is not in $B(p, 1/2)$ for any $p \\in C$.\n\nTherefore, for any two distinct points $p_1, p_2 \\in C$, the ball $B(p_1, 1/2)$ is a subset of $L_1 \\setminus \\{O\\}$ and the ball $B(p_2, 1/2)$ is a subset of $L_2 \\setminus \\{O\\}$. Since $(L_1 \\setminus \\{O\\}) \\cap (L_2 \\setminus \\{O\\}) = \\emptyset$, it follows that $B(p_1, 1/2) \\cap B(p_2, 1/2) = \\emptyset$.\n\nWe have constructed a collection of open sets $\\{ B(p, 1/2) \\mid p \\in C \\}$. This collection has the following properties:\n1.  Each set $B(p, 1/2)$ is a non-empty open set in $(\\mathbb{R}^2, d_{HS})$.\n2.  The sets are pairwise disjoint.\n3.  The collection is uncountable, as it is indexed by the uncountable set $C$.\n\nNow, suppose for the sake of contradiction that $(\\mathbb{R}^2, d_{HS})$ is separable. This would mean there exists a countable dense subset $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$. By the definition of a dense set, for any non-empty open set $U$, the intersection $S \\cap U$ must be non-empty.\nApplying this to our collection, for each $p \\in C$, the set $S \\cap B(p, 1/2)$ must be non-empty. Let's choose a point $s_p \\in S \\cap B(p, 1/2)$ for each $p \\in C$.\nSince the balls $B(p, 1/2)$ are pairwise disjoint, if $p_1 \\neq p_2$, then $s_{p_1} \\in B(p_1, 1/2)$ and $s_{p_2} \\in B(p_2, 1/2)$ must be distinct points.\nThis establishes an injective mapping from the uncountable set $C$ to the subset $\\{s_p \\mid p \\in C\\} \\subset S$. This implies that the set $S$ must also be uncountable.\nThis contradicts our initial assumption that $S$ is a countable dense subset. Therefore, no such countable dense subset can exist.\n\nWe conclude that the metric space $(\\mathbb{R}^2, d_{HS})$ is not separable.\nThis eliminates option A. Option D is also incorrect, as the same argument can be applied within the closed unit disk, using the points on its boundary (the unit circle). Option C is a distractor; restricting to points with rational coordinates would create a countable subspace, which is trivially separable, but this says nothing about the separability of the entire space.
