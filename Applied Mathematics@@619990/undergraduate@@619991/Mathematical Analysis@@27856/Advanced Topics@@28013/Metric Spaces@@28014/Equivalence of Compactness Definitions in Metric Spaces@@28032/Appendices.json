In our case, the union of the open intervals from the net must cover $[a,b]$. The total length of the union of these $k$ intervals is at most $k \\cdot 2\\epsilon$.

The length of each sub-interval would be $\\frac{9.7}{7} \\approx 1.3857$. The maximum distance from any point in a sub-interval to its midpoint is half its length, which is $\\frac{1.3857}{2} \\approx 0.6928$.
