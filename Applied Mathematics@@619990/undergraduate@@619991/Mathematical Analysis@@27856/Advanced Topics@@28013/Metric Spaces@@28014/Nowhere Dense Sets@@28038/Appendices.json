We will show that $S$ is a closed set. A set is closed if its complement is open. Let's consider the complement of $S$ in $[0,1]$, which is $[0,1] \\setminus S$.\n\nLet $x \\in [0,1] \\setminus S$. We need to show that there exists an open interval centered at $x$ that is entirely contained in $[0,1] \\setminus S$.\nSince $x \\notin S$, any decimal expansion of $x$ must contain at least one digit that is not 4 or 7. For numbers with two decimal expansions (those that are terminating, e.g., $0.5 = 0.499\\dots$), both expansions must contain a forbidden digit. Let's choose the expansion for $x$ that does not end in an infinite trail of 9s. Let this expansion be $x = 0.c_1 c_2 c_3 \\dots$.\nSince $x \\notin S$, there must be a first digit, say at position $k$, such that $c_k \\notin \\{4, 7\\}$.\n\nLet's define a number $y$ by truncating the expansion of $x$ just before the $k$-th digit: $y = 0.c_1 c_2 \\dots c_{k-1}$. The digits $c_1, \\dots, c_{k-1}$ must all be in $\\{4, 7\\}$, otherwise $k$ would not be the first position of a forbidden digit.\nAll numbers in $S$ that start with the prefix $0.c_1 \\dots c_{k-1}$ must have their $k$-th digit be either 4 or 7. The set of such numbers in $S$ is a subset of the union of two intervals:\n$I_4 = [y + \\frac{4}{10^k}, y + \\frac{4}{10^k} + \\sum_{j=k+1}^{\\infty} \\frac{7}{10^j}] = [y + \\frac{4}{10^k}, y + \\frac{4}{10^k} + \\frac{7}{9 \\cdot 10^k}]$\n$I_7 = [y + \\frac{7}{10^k}, y + \\frac{7}{10^k} + \\sum_{j=k+1}^{\\infty} \\frac{7}{10^j}] = [y + \\frac{7}{10^k}, y + \\frac{7}{10^k} + \\frac{7}{9 \\cdot 10^k}]$\n\nOur number $x$ has $k$-th digit $c_k \\notin \\{4, 7\\}$.\nConsider the intervals defined by the $k$-th digit:\n$J_m = [y + \\frac{m}{10^k}, y + \\frac{m+1}{10^k})$ for $m \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 9\\}$.\nOur number $x$ lies in $J_{c_k}$.\nSince $c_k$ is not 4 or 7, $x$ does not belong to the intervals corresponding to numbers in $S$. For example, if $c_k  4$, then $x  y + \\frac{4}{10^k}$, which is the smallest number in $S$ with the prefix $y$. If $c_k=5$ or $c_k=6$, then $x$ is in the open interval $(y + \\frac{4}{10^k} + \\frac{7}{9 \\cdot 10^k}, y + \\frac{7}{10^k})$. This is an open \"gap\" that contains no points of $S$.\nIn general, because $c_k \\notin \\{4, 7\\}$, there is a positive distance between $x$ and any point in $S$ that shares the same first $k-1$ digits. This argument can be made more formal to show that there's an open neighborhood around $x$ that is disjoint from $S$. Thus, $[0,1] \\setminus S$ is open, which implies $S$ is a closed set in $[0,1]$.\nSince $S$ is a closed subset of $\\mathbb{R}$, its closure is itself: $\\bar{S} = S$.\n\nNow we need to find the interior of the closure, $\\text{int}(\\bar{S})$, which is $\\text{int}(S)$.\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $\\text{int}(S)$ is non-empty. This means there exists a non-empty open interval $(a,b)$ such that $(a,b) \\subseteq S$.\nAn open interval $(a,b)$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ with $ab$ must contain a rational number that has a terminating decimal expansion. Let's prove this. The length of the interval is $L=b-a > 0$. We can choose an integer $N$ so large that $10^{-N}  L$. The interval $(a,b)$ must then contain a point of the form $m/10^N$ for some integer $m$. Such a number has a terminating decimal expansion.\nLet $q = m/10^N$ be such a number in $(a,b)$.\nThe decimal representation of $q$ contains only a finite number of non-zero digits. We can easily construct a number $q'$ close to $q$ that is not in $S$. For example, we can take $q' = q + 10^{-M}$ for a very large integer $M > N$. By choosing $M$ large enough, we can ensure that $q' \\in (a,b)$. If the decimal representation of $q'$ contains a digit other than 4 or 7 (which it will, e.g. a '1' or '0'), then $q' \\notin S$.\nFor instance, if $q=0.47 \\in S$, we can choose $M$ such that $10^{-M}  b-q$. Then $q' = 0.47 + 10^{-M} = 0.4700\\dots01$ is in $(q,b) \\subset (a,b)$. But $q'$ has digits 0 and 1, so $q' \\notin S$.\nThis shows that our interval $(a,b)$ contains a point $q'$ that is not in $S$. But we assumed $(a,b) \\subseteq S$. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, the initial assumption must be false. The interior of $S$ must be empty: $\\text{int}(S) = \\emptyset$.\n\nSo we have $\\bar{S} = S$ and $\\text{int}(S) = \\emptyset$.\nThe interior of the closure of $S$ is $\\text{int}(\\bar{S}) = \\text{int}(S) = \\emptyset$.\nBy definition, a set $A$ is nowhere dense if $\\text{int}(\\bar{A}) = \\emptyset$. Thus, $S$ is a nowhere dense set.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. $S$ is dense in the interval $[0,1]$. For $S$ to be dense in $[0,1]$, its closure must be $[0,1]$. We found $\\bar{S}=S$. Since $S$ does not contain all points in $[0,1]$ (e.g., $0.5 \\notin S$), $\\bar{S} \\neq [0,1]$. So, A is false.\nB. $S$ is an open set. We proved that $S$ is closed. A subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ that is both open and closed must be either $\\mathbb{R}$ or the empty set. $S$ is neither. Since $S$ is non-empty and closed, it cannot be open. So, B is false.\nC. $S$ is a countable set. The elements of $S$ are determined by infinite sequences of digits from the set $\\{4, 7\\}$. The set of all such sequences, $\\{4, 7\\}^{\\mathbb{N}}$, is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of all infinite binary sequences, which has cardinality $2^{\\aleph_0}$, the cardinality of the continuum. Therefore, $S$ is an uncountable set. So, C is false.\nD. The interior of the closure of $S$ is non-empty. This means $\\text{int}(\\bar{S}) \\neq \\emptyset$. We proved that $\\text{int}(\\bar{S}) = \\emptyset$. So, D is false.\nE. $S$ is a nowhere dense set. This means $\\text{int}(\\bar{S}) = \\emptyset$. We proved this to be true.
