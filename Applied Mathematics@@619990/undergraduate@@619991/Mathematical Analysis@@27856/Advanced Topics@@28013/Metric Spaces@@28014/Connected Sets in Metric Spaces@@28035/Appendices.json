A set is connected if it cannot be expressed as the union of two disjoint non-empty open subsets (in the relative topology). A useful property is that if a set is path-connected, it is connected. Furthermore, if a collection of connected sets has a non-empty intersection, their union is also connected.\n\n**Analysis of Set I: $S_1 = C_1 \\cup C_2$**\nThe set $C_1$ is a circle, which is a path-connected space. To see this, any two points on a circle can be connected by an arc of that circle, which is a continuous path. The same logic applies to the circle $C_2$. A path-connected set is always connected. So, $C_1$ and $C_2$ are connected sets.\nThe intersection of these two sets is the point of tangency. By substituting $(x,y)=(0,0)$ into the equations for $C_1$ and $C_2$, we see that $(0+r_1)^2+0^2 = r_1^2$ and $(0-r_2)^2+0^2=r_2^2$, so the origin is on both circles. For any other point $(x,y)$ in their intersection, we would have $x^2+y^2 = -2r_1x$ and $x^2+y^2 = 2r_2x$. This implies $-2r_1x = 2r_2x$, which means $(2r_1+2r_2)x=0$. Since $r_1, r_2 > 0$, we must have $x=0$. Substituting $x=0$ back into the circle equations gives $y=0$. Thus, the intersection is a single point: $C_1 \\cap C_2 = \\{(0,0)\\}$.\nSince the intersection $C_1 \\cap C_2$ is non-empty, and both $C_1$ and $C_2$ are connected, their union $S_1 = C_1 \\cup C_2$ is connected. Therefore, statement I describes a connected set.\n\n**Analysis of Set II: $S_2 = (C_1 \\cup C_2) \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$**\nThis set is the union of two circles with their point of tangency removed. Let $A = C_1 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$ and $B = C_2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$. Then $S_2 = A \\cup B$. Note that $A$ consists of all points on $C_1$ except the origin, and $B$ consists of all points on $C_2$ except the origin. Therefore, $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$.\nTo show that $S_2$ is disconnected, we need to find a separation. Let $U = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x  0\\}$ and $V = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x > 0\\}$. These are open half-planes in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\nFor any point $(x,y) \\in C_1$ other than the origin, $(x+r_1)^2+y^2=r_1^2$ implies $x^2+2r_1x+r_1^2+y^2=r_1^2$, so $x^2+y^2=-2r_1x$. Since $(x,y) \\neq (0,0)$, we have $x^2+y^2>0$, which implies $-2r_1x>0$. As $r_1>0$, we must have $x0$. Thus, $A \\subset U$.\nSimilarly, for any point $(x,y) \\in C_2$ other than the origin, $(x-r_2)^2+y^2=r_2^2$ implies $x^2+y^2=2r_2x$. This implies $x>0$. Thus, $B \\subset V$.\nSo, we have:\n1. $S_2 = A \\cup B \\subset U \\cup V$.\n2. $S_2 \\cap U = A$, which is non-empty.\n3. $S_2 \\cap V = B$, which is non-empty.\n4. $S_2 \\cap U \\cap V = \\emptyset$ because $U \\cap V = \\emptyset$.\nThe sets $A$ and $B$ form a separation of $S_2$ in the subspace topology. More formally, using open sets from the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the pair $(U, V)$ forms a separation of $S_2$. Therefore, $S_2$ is disconnected.\n\n**Analysis of Set III: $S_3 = D_1 \\cup D_2$**\nThe set $D_1$ is an open disk. For any point $(x,y) \\in D_1$, we have $(x+r_1)^2+y^2  r_1^2$, which implies $x^2+2r_1x+r_1^2+y^2  r_1^2$, so $x^2+y^2  -2r_1x$. This implies $x  0$. So all points in $D_1$ have a negative x-coordinate.\nSimilarly, for any point $(x,y) \\in D_2$, we have $(x-r_2)^2+y^2  r_2^2$, which implies $x^2+y^2  2r_2x$. This implies $x > 0$. So all points in $D_2$ have a positive x-coordinate.\nThis shows that the two open disks $D_1$ and $D_2$ are disjoint, i.e., $D_1 \\cap D_2 = \\emptyset$.\nThe set $S_3$ is the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets, $D_1$ and $D_2$. This is the definition of a disconnected set. The sets $D_1$ and $D_2$ themselves form a separation of $S_3$. Therefore, $S_3$ is disconnected.\n\n**Analysis of Set IV: $S_4 = \\bar{D}_1 \\cup \\bar{D}_2$**\nThe set $\\bar{D}_1$ is a closed disk. A closed disk is a convex set, and any convex set is path-connected. A path-connected set is connected. Thus, $\\bar{D}_1$ is a connected set. Similarly, $\\bar{D}_2$ is a connected set.\nThe intersection of these two sets is the set of points $(x,y)$ such that $(x+r_1)^2+y^2 \\le r_1^2$ and $(x-r_2)^2+y^2 \\le r_2^2$. As shown in the analysis of $S_1$, the boundaries only intersect at the origin. The interiors are disjoint. Thus, the intersection of the two closed disks is just the origin: $\\bar{D}_1 \\cap \\bar{D}_2 = \\{(0,0)\\}$.\nSince the intersection $\\bar{D}_1 \\cap \\bar{D}_2$ is non-empty, and both $\\bar{D}_1$ and $\\bar{D}_2$ are connected, their union $S_4 = \\bar{D}_1 \\cup \\bar{D}_2$ is connected. Therefore, statement IV describes a connected set.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe sets described in I and IV are connected. The sets described in II and III are disconnected.
