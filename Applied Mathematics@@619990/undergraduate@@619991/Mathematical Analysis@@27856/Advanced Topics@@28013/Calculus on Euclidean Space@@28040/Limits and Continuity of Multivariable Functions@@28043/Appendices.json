A fundamental principle for multivariable limits is that, if a limit exists at a point, it must be path-independent; that is, the value approached along any path tending to the point must be the same. We will evaluate $C(x,y)$ along different paths approaching $(0,0)$ and compare the resulting limits.\n\nFirst, consider the path along the $x$-axis given by $y=0$ with $x \\to 0$. Substituting $y=0$ gives\n$$\nC(x,0) = \\frac{x \\cdot 0}{x^{2} + \\sin^{2}(0)} = \\frac{0}{x^{2} + 0} = 0,\n$$\nso along this path the limit is $0$.\n\nNext, consider the path defined by $x = \\sin(y)$ with $y \\to 0$.

Because a multivariable limit, if it exists, must be unique and independent of path, these two different values imply that the limit does not exist.\n\nFor completeness, note that a more general family of paths $x = k \\sin(y)$ with constant $k$ gives\n$$\nC(k \\sin(y), y) = \\frac{k \\sin(y)\\, y}{k^{2} \\sin^{2}(y) + \\sin^{2}(y)} = \\frac{k}{k^{2}+1} \\cdot \\frac{y}{\\sin(y)} \\to \\frac{k}{k^{2}+1}\n$$\nas $y \\to 0$, which varies with $k$ and confirms the nonexistence of a unique limit.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is that the limit does not exist.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2306128"}, {"introduction": "Beyond just evaluating limits, a key skill is using them to ensure continuity, especially for functions defined piecewise, a common situation in engineering and materials science.
