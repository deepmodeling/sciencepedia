A point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ is a limit point of $S$ if every open ball centered at $p$ contains at least one point of $S$ other than $p$ itself. For a set defined parametrically like $S$, the limit points that are not already in $S$ can be found by examining the behavior of the parametrization at the boundaries of the parameter's domain. The domain for the parameter $t$ is $(0, \\infty)$, so we need to investigate the limits as $t \\to 0^+$ and $t \\to \\infty$.\n\nLet the parametric function be $f(t) = (\\cos(t), \\sin(t), e^{-t})$.\n\nFirst, let's consider the limit as $t$ approaches $0$ from the positive side ($t \\to 0^+$):\n$$ \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} f(t) = \\left( \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} \\cos(t), \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} \\sin(t), \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} e^{-t} \\right) $$\nUsing standard limits, we find:\n$$ \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} \\cos(t) = \\cos(0) = 1 $$\n$$ \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} \\sin(t) = \\sin(0) = 0 $$\n$$ \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} e^{-t} = e^{0} = 1 $$\nSo, as $t \\to 0^+$, the points on the spiral approach the point $p_0 = (1, 0, 1)$. Since the parameter domain is $t > 0$, the point $p_0$ is not itself in the set $S$. By definition, $p_0$ is a limit point of $S$.\n\nNext, let's consider the behavior as $t \\to \\infty$:\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, the $z$-component of the curve, $z(t) = e^{-t}$, approaches 0.\nThe $x$ and $y$ components, $x(t) = \\cos(t)$ and $y(t) = \\sin(t)$, do not converge to a single value; they oscillate. For any $t$, we have $x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 = \\cos^2(t) + \\sin^2(t) = 1$. This means that as the curve approaches the $xy$-plane (where $z=0$), it remains at a unit distance from the $z$-axis. The set of points approached by the curve is the unit circle $C = \\{ (x, y, 0) \\mid x^2 + y^2 = 1 \\}$.\n\nTo be more rigorous, we must show that every point on the circle $C$ is a limit point of $S$. Let $p_c = (\\cos(\\theta_0), \\sin(\\theta_0), 0)$ be an arbitrary point on $C$ for some $\\theta_0 \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. We need to show that we can find a sequence of points in $S$ that converges to $p_c$.\nConsider the sequence of parameter values $t_k = \\theta_0 + 2\\pi k$ for integers $k \\ge 1$. As $k \\to \\infty$, we have $t_k \\to \\infty$.\nThe corresponding sequence of points in $S$ is $s_k = f(t_k) = (\\cos(\\theta_0 + 2\\pi k), \\sin(\\theta_0 + 2\\pi k), e^{-(\\theta_0 + 2\\pi k)})$.\nUsing the periodicity of sine and cosine, this simplifies to $s_k = (\\cos(\\theta_0), \\sin(\\theta_0), e^{-(\\theta_0 + 2\\pi k)})$.\nAs $k \\to \\infty$, the exponent $-(\\theta_0 + 2\\pi k) \\to -\\infty$, so $e^{-(\\theta_0 + 2\\pi k)} \\to 0$.\nTherefore, the sequence of points $s_k$ converges to $(\\cos(\\theta_0), \\sin(\\theta_0), 0) = p_c$.\nSince we can construct such a sequence for any point $p_c$ on the circle $C$, the entire circle $C$ is a set of limit points of $S$. Note that no point in $C$ is in $S$, because for any point in $S$, its $z$-coordinate is $e^{-t} > 0$, while for points in $C$, the $z$-coordinate is 0.\n\nThe set of all limit points of $S$ is the union of points in $S$ itself (since there are no isolated points) and the limit points we found that are not in $S$.\nThe set of limit points not in $S$ is precisely the union of the point $p_0$ and the circle $C$.\nThe closure $\\bar{S}$ is the union of $S$ and all its limit points.\nTherefore, $\\bar{S} = S \\cup \\{ (1, 0, 1) \\} \\cup C$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2329875"}, {"introduction": "After exploring a single connected object, we now turn to dissecting a set into its fundamental connected \"pieces\". This practice challenges you to determine the number of connected components for a set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ defined by a simple algebraic inequality. You will need to translate the inequality into a geometric picture and reason about which parts of the set can be connected by a continuous path and which are irreconcilably separated [@problem_id:2329893].", "problem": "A subset of the Euclidean plane, $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$, is defined by the inequality $x^2 y^2 > 1$.

Determine the total number of connected components of the set $S$.", "solution": "The set $S$ is defined as $S = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x^2 y^2 > 1\\}$. To determine the number of connected components, we first analyze the inequality that defines the set.\n\nThe inequality $x^2 y^2 > 1$ can be rewritten as $(xy)^2 > 1$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $\\sqrt{(xy)^2} > \\sqrt{1}$, which is equivalent to $|xy| > 1$.\n\nThis absolute value inequality can be split into two separate cases:\n1. $xy > 1$\n2. $xy < -1$\n\nLet's define two disjoint sets based on these cases:\n$A = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid xy > 1\\}$\n$B = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid xy < -1\\}$\nThe set $S$ is the union of these two sets, $S = A \\cup B$. The sets $A$ and $B$ are disjoint. Since the functions $f(x,y) = xy-1$ and $g(x,y)=-1-xy$ are continuous, the sets $A=f^{-1}((0, \\infty))$ and $B=g^{-1}((0, \\infty))$ are open in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. As $S=A \\cup B$ is a union of two disjoint non-empty open sets, $S$ is not connected. The connected components of $S$ are the union of the connected components of $A$ and the connected components of $B$.\n\nLet's first analyze the set $A = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid xy > 1\\}$.\nFor the product $xy$ to be positive, $x$ and $y$ must have the same sign. This means the set $A$ is restricted to the first and third quadrants of the Cartesian plane. Note that neither $x$ nor $y$ can be zero.\nLet's define two subsets of $A$:\n$S_1 = \\{(x,y) \\in A \\mid x > 0 \\text{ and } y > 0\\} = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x>0, y > 1/x \\}$. This is a region in the first quadrant.\n$S_3 = \\{(x,y) \\in A \\mid x < 0 \\text{ and } y < 0\\} = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x<0, y < 1/x \\}$. This is a region in the third quadrant.\nThe sets $S_1$ and $S_3$ are disjoint. Any continuous path from a point in $S_1$ to a point in $S_3$ must cross a coordinate axis. On the x-axis, $y=0$, so $xy=0$. On the y-axis, $x=0$, so $xy=0$. In either case, the condition $xy > 1$ is not met. Thus, no point on the axes lies in $A$. This means $S_1$ and $S_3$ are separated, and $A$ is not connected.\n\nNow we check if $S_1$ and $S_3$ are themselves connected. A simple way is to check for path-connectedness.\nFor $S_1$: Consider the function $f(x) = 1/x$ for $x > 0$. Its second derivative is $f''(x) = 2/x^3 > 0$, so $f(x)$ is a convex function. The set $S_1$ is the set of points above the graph of $f(x)$, which is the epigraph of a convex function. An epigraph of a convex function is a convex set. Every convex set is path-connected, and therefore connected. So, $S_1$ is a connected component of $A$.\nFor $S_3$: Consider the function $g(x) = 1/x$ for $x < 0$. Its second derivative is $g''(x) = 2/x^3 < 0$, so $g(x)$ is a concave function. The set $S_3$ is the set of points below the graph of $g(x)$, which is the hypograph of a concave function. A hypograph of a concave function is a convex set. Therefore, $S_3$ is also path-connected and connected. So, $S_3$ is the other connected component of $A$.\nSo, the set $A$ has two connected components: $S_1$ and $S_3$.\n\nNext, let's analyze the set $B = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid xy < -1\\}$.\nFor the product $xy$ to be negative, $x$ and $y$ must have opposite signs. This means the set $B$ is restricted to the second and fourth quadrants.\nLet's define two subsets of $B$:\n$S_2 = \\{(x,y) \\in B \\mid x < 0 \\text{ and } y > 0\\} = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x<0, y > -1/x \\}$. This is a region in the second quadrant.\n$S_4 = \\{(x,y) \\in B \\mid x > 0 \\text{ and } y < 0\\} = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x>0, y < -1/x \\}$. This is a region in the fourth quadrant.\nAgain, $S_2$ and $S_4$ are disjoint, and any path between them must cross a coordinate axis where $xy=0$. The condition $xy < -1$ is not satisfied on the axes, so $S_2$ and $S_4$ are separated.\nTo check if $S_2$ and $S_4$ are connected, we again consider convexity.\nFor $S_2$: Consider $h(x) = -1/x$ for $x < 0$. $h''(x) = -2/x^3 > 0$, so $h(x)$ is convex. $S_2$ is the epigraph of $h(x)$ and is therefore a convex set, which implies it is path-connected and connected.\nFor $S_4$: Consider $k(x) = -1/x$ for $x > 0$. $k''(x) = -2/x^3 < 0$, so $k(x)$ is concave. $S_4$ is the hypograph of $k(x)$ and is therefore a convex set, which implies it is path-connected and connected.\nSo, the set $B$ has two connected components: $S_2$ and $S_4$.\n\nIn total, the set $S = S_1 \\cup S_2 \\cup S_3 \\cup S_4$. These four sets are disjoint and each is path-connected (and thus connected). They are located in the four separate quadrants of the plane. Any continuous path from one of these sets to another must cross one or both of the coordinate axes, where $xy=0$. Since the condition for being in $S$ is $|xy|>1$, no point on the axes is in $S$. Therefore, no path can connect any two of the sets $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$ while staying within $S$.\nThis means that $S_1, S_2, S_3,$ and $S_4$ are the maximal connected subsets of $S$. They are the connected components of $S$.\n\nThus, there are 4 connected components in total.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "2329893"}, {"introduction": "Our final exercise pushes the concept of connectedness to its counter-intuitive limits, demonstrating that visual intuition can sometimes be misleading in topology.

Let $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2) \\in S$. Choose fixed $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. We construct a path from $(x_1, y_1)$ to $(a,b)$ within $S$ as follows:\n- If $y_1 \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, move along the horizontal line $y=y_1$ from $(x_1, y_1)$ to $(a, y_1)$; this entire segment lies in $S$ because $y_1 \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. Then move along the vertical line $x=a$ from $(a, y_1)$ to $(a,b)$; this segment lies in $S$ because $x=a \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n- If $y_1 \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$, then $x_1 \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ by definition of $S$. Move along the vertical line $x=x_1$ from $(x_1, y_1)$ to $(x_1, b)$; this lies in $S$ because $x_1 \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. Then move along the horizontal line $y=b$ from $(x_1,b)$ to $(a,b)$; this lies in $S$ because $y=b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nIn either case, we obtain a piecewise linear path in $S$ from $(x_1, y_1)$ to $(a,b)$. Repeating the same construction yields a path in $S$ from $(x_2, y_2)$ to $(a,b)$. Reversing that second path and concatenating shows there is a continuous path in $S$ from $(x_1, y_1)$ to $(x_2, y_2)$. Hence $S$ is path-connected, and therefore connected. Thus A is true and B is false.\n\nNext, $S$ is not open. Let $(x_0, y_0) \\in S$ and let $r>0$. Since the irrationals are dense in $\\mathbb{R}$, we can find $u,v \\in \\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\mathbb{Q}$ with $|u-x_0|<r/ \\sqrt{2}$ and $|v-y_0|<r/ \\sqrt{2}$. Then the point $(u,v)$ is in the open ball $B((x_0, y_0),r)$ but $(u,v)\\notin S$, because neither coordinate is rational. Therefore no open ball about any point of $S$ is contained in $S$, so $S$ is not open. Thus C is false.\n\nAlso, $S$ is not closed. Consider any point $(\\alpha,\\beta)\\in(\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\mathbb{Q})\\times(\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\mathbb{Q})$. Choose a sequence $(\\alpha_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}} \\subset \\mathbb{Q}$ with $\\alpha_n \\to \\alpha$. Then the sequence of points $(\\alpha_n, \\beta)$ is in $S$ for all $n$, and $(\\alpha_n, \\beta) \\to (\\alpha, \\beta) \\notin S$. Hence $S$ does not contain all its limit points and is not closed. Thus D is false.\n\nFinally, $S$ is not compact. By the Heine–Borel theorem, a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. We have shown $S$ is not closed, and it is also unbounded (for example, it contains the entire $x$-axis), so it is not compact.
