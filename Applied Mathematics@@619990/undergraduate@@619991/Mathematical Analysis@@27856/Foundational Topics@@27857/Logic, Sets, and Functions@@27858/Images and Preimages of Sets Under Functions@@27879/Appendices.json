The image, denoted as $f((0, 1])$, is the set of all values $f(x)$ where $x$ is an element of $(0, 1]$. We can write this as $f((0, 1]) = \\{ \\cos(\\ln x) \\mid x \\in (0, 1] \\}$.\n\nThe function $f(x)$ is a composition of two functions: the natural logarithm function, $g(x) = \\ln x$, and the cosine function, $h(u) = \\cos u$. We have $f(x) = h(g(x))$. To find the image of an interval under a composite function, we can first find the image of the interval under the inner function, and then find the image of the resulting set under the outer function.\n\nStep 1: Find the image of the interval $(0, 1]$ under the inner function $g(x) = \\ln x$.\nLet the interval be $A = (0, 1]$. We want to find the set $U = g(A) = \\{ \\ln x \\mid x \\in (0, 1] \\}$.\nThe natural logarithm function, $\\ln x$, is a continuous and strictly increasing function on its entire domain $(0, \\infty)$.\nWe examine the behavior of $\\ln x$ on the boundaries of the interval $A$.\nAt the right endpoint, $x=1$, we have $\\ln(1) = 0$. Since $1 \\in A$, the value $0$ is in the image set $U$.\nAs $x$ approaches the left boundary, $0$, from the right side (denoted $x \\to 0^+$), the value of $\\ln x$ approaches negative infinity ($\\ln x \\to -\\infty$).\nBecause $\\ln x$ is continuous and increasing, as $x$ takes every value in $(0, 1]$, $\\ln x$ takes every value in the interval $(-\\infty, 0]$.\nSo, the image of $(0, 1]$ under $\\ln x$ is the set $U = (-\\infty, 0]$.\n\nStep 2: Find the image of the set $U = (-\\infty, 0]$ under the outer function $h(u) = \\cos u$.\nWe are now looking for the set $\\{ \\cos u \\mid u \\in (-\\infty, 0] \\}$.\nThe cosine function, $\\cos u$, is a periodic function with a period of $2\\pi$. Its range over the set of all real numbers is the closed interval $[-1, 1]$.\nThe input interval for the cosine function is $U = (-\\infty, 0]$. This is an infinite interval. As $u$ takes values from $0$ and goes towards $-\\infty$, it passes through infinitely many intervals of length $2\\pi$. For example, the interval $[-2\\pi, 0]$ is a subset of $(-\\infty, 0]$.\nOn any interval of length $2\\pi$, the cosine function achieves all the values in its range, i.e., all values from $-1$ to $1$. For instance, considering the interval $[-2\\pi, 0]$:\n- When $u=0$, $\\cos(0) = 1$.\n- When $u=-\\pi$, $\\cos(-\\pi) = -1$.\n- When $u=-2\\pi$, $\\cos(-2\\pi) = 1$.\nSince the interval $(-\\infty, 0]$ contains infinitely many such intervals of the form $[(k-1)2\\pi, k(2\\pi)]$ for $k \\le 0$, the function $\\cos u$ will attain all values between its minimum, $-1$, and its maximum, $1$, inclusive.\nTherefore, the image of $(-\\infty, 0]$ under the function $\\cos u$ is the closed interval $[-1, 1]$.\n\nCombining these steps, the image of the interval $(0, 1]$ under the function $f(x) = \\cos(\\ln x)$ is $[-1, 1]$.\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA. $[0, 1]$\nB. $[-1, 1]$\nC. $(-1, 1)$\nD. $[\\cos(1), 1]$\nE. $\\mathbb{R}$\n\nThe correct option is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2301732"}, {"introduction": "Next, we transition from the real line to the complex plane, a vital step in broadening our analytical perspective.

The boundary $\\partial D = \\{z : |z| = 1\\}$ passes through $z = -i$, which is the pole of $f$, so $f(\\partial D)$ is a straight line.
