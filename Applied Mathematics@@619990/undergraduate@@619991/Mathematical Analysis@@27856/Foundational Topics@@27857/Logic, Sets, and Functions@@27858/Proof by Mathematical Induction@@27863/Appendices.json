This exercise presents a seemingly correct proof that contains a common logical error, challenging you to identify the flaw. This practice will sharpen your understanding of how to correctly apply the inductive hypothesis, especially the crucial difference between an assumption of equality versus an assumption of inequality [@problem_id:1383046].", "problem": "A student is trying to construct a proof by mathematical induction for the proposition that for all positive integers $n$, the inequality $P(n)$ given by $\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{1}{k^2} \\le 2 - \\frac{1}{n}$ is true. The student's argument is presented in four steps below. However, the argument contains a logical flaw.\n\n**The Purported Proof:**\n\n**Step 1: Base Case**\nFor $n=1$, the left-hand side (LHS) of the inequality is $\\sum_{k=1}^1 \\frac{1}{k^2} = \\frac{1}{1^2} = 1$. The right-hand side (RHS) is $2 - \\frac{1}{1} = 1$. Since $1 \\le 1$, the proposition $P(1)$ holds true.\n\n**Step 2: Inductive Hypothesis**\nAssume that for some arbitrary integer $m \\ge 1$, the proposition $P(m)$ is true. That is, we assume $\\sum_{k=1}^m \\frac{1}{k^2} \\le 2 - \\frac{1}{m}$.\n\n**Step 3: Inductive Step**\nWe aim to prove that $P(m+1)$ is true, i.e., $\\sum_{k=1}^{m+1} \\frac{1}{k^2} \\le 2 - \\frac{1}{m+1}$.\nWe begin with the LHS of $P(m+1)$:\nLHS = $\\sum_{k=1}^{m+1} \\frac{1}{k^2} = \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{k^2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{(m+1)^2}$.\nAccording to the inductive hypothesis from Step 2, we can substitute the sum, so we write:\nLHS = $\\left(2 - \\frac{1}{m}\\right) + \\frac{1}{(m+1)^2}$.\nNow, we just need to show that this resulting expression is less than or equal to the RHS of $P(m+1)$:\n$2 - \\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{(m+1)^2} \\le 2 - \\frac{1}{m+1}$.\nSubtracting 2 from both sides gives:\n$-\\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{(m+1)^2} \\le -\\frac{1}{m+1}$.\nRearranging the terms:\n$\\frac{1}{m+1} - \\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{(m+1)^2} \\le 0$.\nFinding a common denominator for the fractions, $m(m+1)^2$:\n$\\frac{m(m+1) - (m+1)^2 + m}{m(m+1)^2} \\le 0$.\n$\\frac{m^2 + m - (m^2 + 2m + 1) + m}{m(m+1)^2} \\le 0$.\n$\\frac{m^2 + m - m^2 - 2m - 1 + m}{m(m+1)^2} \\le 0$.\n$\\frac{-1}{m(m+1)^2} \\le 0$.\nSince $m \\ge 1$, the denominator $m(m+1)^2$ is always positive. Therefore, the expression $\\frac{-1}{m(m+1)^2}$ is always negative, and the inequality is true. This completes the inductive step.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nSince the base case is true (Step 1) and the inductive step (Step 3) has been successfully shown, we conclude by the principle of mathematical induction that the proposition $P(n)$ is true for all positive integers $n$.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly identifies the fundamental flaw in the student's argument?\n\nA. The arithmetic for the base case in Step 1 is incorrect.\n\nB. The algebraic simplification in Step 3, which leads to the expression $\\frac{-1}{m(m+1)^2}$, is incorrect.\n\nC. The conclusion in Step 4 is logically invalid as a general statement about induction.\n\nD. The inductive hypothesis from Step 2 is applied incorrectly in Step 3.\n\nE. The statement of the inductive hypothesis in Step 2 is itself incorrect.", "solution": "We examine each step of the purported proof and check its validity.\n\nStep 1 (Base case) computes $\\sum_{k=1}^{1} \\frac{1}{k^{2}} = 1$ and $2 - \\frac{1}{1} = 1$, so $1 \\le 1$ holds. There is no arithmetic error here.\n\nStep 2 (Inductive hypothesis) assumes for some $m \\ge 1$ that $P(m)$ is true: $\\sum_{k=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{k^{2}} \\le 2 - \\frac{1}{m}$. This hypothesis is correctly stated.\n\nStep 3 (Inductive step) starts with\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{m+1} \\frac{1}{k^{2}} = \\sum_{k=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{k^{2}} + \\frac{1}{(m+1)^{2}}.\n$$\nBy the inductive hypothesis, we only have\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{k^{2}} \\le 2 - \\frac{1}{m},\n$$\nso the correct inequality is\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{m+1} \\frac{1}{k^{2}} \\le \\left(2 - \\frac{1}{m}\\right) + \\frac{1}{(m+1)^{2}},\n$$\nnot an equality. The student writes\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{m+1} \\frac{1}{k^{2}} = \\left(2 - \\frac{1}{m}\\right) + \\frac{1}{(m+1)^{2}},\n$$\nwhich incorrectly replaces a quantity bounded above by $2 - \\frac{1}{m}$ with that exact bound. This is a misuse of the inductive hypothesis. After this misstep, the student aims to prove\n$$\n2 - \\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{(m+1)^{2}} \\le 2 - \\frac{1}{m+1},\n$$\nwhich is indeed true, since it is equivalent to\n$$\n\\frac{1}{(m+1)^{2}} \\le \\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{1}{m+1} = \\frac{1}{m(m+1)},\n$$\nand because $m(m+1) \\le (m+1)^{2}$ for $m \\ge 1$, we have $\\frac{1}{(m+1)^{2}} \\le \\frac{1}{m(m+1)}$. Alternatively, following the student’s algebra,\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{(m+1)^{2}} \\le -\\frac{1}{m+1}\n\\;\\;\\Longleftrightarrow\\;\\;\n\\frac{1}{m+1} - \\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{(m+1)^{2}} \\le 0,\n$$\nand with common denominator $m(m+1)^{2}$, the numerator is\n$$\nm(m+1) - (m+1)^{2} + m = -1,\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\frac{-1}{m(m+1)^{2}} \\le 0,\n$$\nwhich is true for $m \\ge 1$. Thus the algebra is correct.\n\nStep 4 (Conclusion) would be valid if Step 3 correctly applied the inductive hypothesis. The only flaw is the incorrect use of equality when invoking the inductive hypothesis in Step 3.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental flaw is the incorrect application of the inductive hypothesis in Step 3.\n\nThe correct option is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1383046"}, {"introduction": "The principle of induction extends far beyond number theory and combinatorics, serving as a key technique in fields like calculus.
