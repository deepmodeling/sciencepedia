The exclusion connective is both associative and commutative.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to test whether the property of associativity holds for the newly defined connective $\\odot$.\n\nFirst, let's express the definition of the exclusion connective $P \\odot Q$ using standard logical connectives. The statement \"$P$ is true and $Q$ is false\" corresponds to the logical expression $P \\wedge \\neg Q$. Thus, we have the definition:\n$$P \\odot Q \\equiv P \\wedge \\neg Q$$\n\nNext, we state the condition for associativity for the connective $\\odot$. It must satisfy the following equivalence for all possible truth values of propositions $P$, $Q$, and $R$:\n$$(P \\odot Q) \\odot R \\equiv P \\odot (Q \\odot R)$$\n\nWe will now analyze the left-hand side (LHS) and the right-hand side (RHS) of this prospective equivalence separately.\n\nFor the LHS:\n$$(P \\odot Q) \\odot R$$\nFirst, we substitute the definition for the expression in the parentheses:\n$$(P \\wedge \\neg Q) \\odot R$$\nNow, we apply the definition of $\\odot$ again, where $(P \\wedge \\neg Q)$ is the first proposition and $R$ is the second:\n$$(P \\wedge \\neg Q) \\wedge \\neg R$$\n\nFor the RHS:\n$$P \\odot (Q \\odot R)$$\nFirst, we substitute the definition for the expression in the parentheses:\n$$P \\odot (Q \\wedge \\neg R)$$\nNow, we apply the definition of $\\odot$ again, where $P$ is the first proposition and $(Q \\wedge \\neg R)$ is the second:\n$$P \\wedge \\neg(Q \\wedge \\neg R)$$\nWe can simplify the negated term using De Morgan's laws, which state that $\\neg(A \\wedge B) \\equiv \\neg A \\vee \\neg B$:\n$$\\neg(Q \\wedge \\neg R) \\equiv \\neg Q \\vee \\neg(\\neg R) \\equiv \\neg Q \\vee R$$\nSo, the RHS simplifies to:\n$$P \\wedge (\\neg Q \\vee R)$$\n\nNow, to check for associativity, we must check if the LHS and RHS are logically equivalent:\n$$(P \\wedge \\neg Q) \\wedge \\neg R \\equiv P \\wedge (\\neg Q \\vee R)$$\n\nTo do this, we can construct a truth table for all eight combinations of truth values for $P$, $Q$, and $R$.\n\n| P | Q | R | $\\neg Q$ | $\\neg R$ | $P \\wedge \\neg Q$ | **LHS: $(P \\wedge \\neg Q) \\wedge \\neg R$** | $\\neg Q \\vee R$ | **RHS: $P \\wedge (\\neg Q \\vee R)$** |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| T | T | T | F | F | F | F | T | T |\n| T | T | F | F | T | F | F | F | F |\n| T | F | T | T | F | T | F | T | T |\n| T | F | F | T | T | T | T | T | T |\n| F | T | T | F | F | F | F | T | F |\n| F | T | F | F | T | F | F | F | F |\n| F | F | T | T | F | F | F | T | F |\n| F | F | F | T | T | F | F | T | F |\n\nBy comparing the column for the LHS with the column for the RHS, we can see that they are not identical. For instance, in the first row where $P, Q, R$ are all True, the LHS evaluates to False while the RHS evaluates to True. Since we have found a counterexample, the two expressions are not logically equivalent. Therefore, the connective $\\odot$ is not associative. This means option B is correct.\n\nLet's briefly examine the other options.\nOption A is false, as proven above.\nOption C is conceptually flawed. Associativity is a property that must hold universally for all propositions. If it fails for even one case, the connective is declared not associative. The property cannot be 'dependent' on a specific proposition's value.\nOption D suggests the connective is also commutative. A connective is commutative if $P \\odot Q \\equiv Q \\odot P$. We have $P \\odot Q \\equiv P \\wedge \\neg Q$ and $Q \\odot P \\equiv Q \\wedge \\neg P$. If we take $P$ to be True and $Q$ to be False, then $P \\odot Q$ is $T \\wedge \\neg F \\equiv T \\wedge T \\equiv T$. In contrast, $Q \\odot P$ is $F \\wedge \\neg T \\equiv F \\wedge F \\equiv F$. Since $T \\not\\equiv F$, the connective is not commutative.
