This first exercise provides practice in this essential skill. We'll explore the set of all possible arithmetic progressions defined by rational numbers, a concept that may seem abstract at first. By modeling each progression as an ordered pair, you will see how a seemingly complex set can be analyzed using a fundamental principle of countability concerning Cartesian products [@problem_id:2295286].", "problem": "An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference. An arithmetic progression is uniquely determined by its first term, $a_1$, and its common difference, $d$. The sequence is given by $(a_1, a_1+d, a_1+2d, a_1+3d, \\dots)$.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{A}$ be the set of all possible arithmetic progressions where both the first term $a_1$ and the common difference $d$ are rational numbers.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the cardinality of the set $\\mathcal{A}$?\n\nA. $\\mathcal{A}$ is a finite set.\nB. $\\mathcal{A}$ is a countably infinite set.\nC. $\\mathcal{A}$ has the same cardinality as the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$.\nD. $\\mathcal{A}$ has a cardinality strictly greater than the cardinality of the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the cardinality of the set $\\mathcal{A}$, which is the set of all arithmetic progressions with rational first terms and rational common differences.\n\nAn arithmetic progression is uniquely defined by its first term, $a_1$, and its common difference, $d$. Therefore, we can establish a one-to-one correspondence (a bijection) between each arithmetic progression in the set $\\mathcal{A}$ and an ordered pair of numbers $(a_1, d)$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, both $a_1$ and $d$ must be rational numbers. The set of all rational numbers is denoted by $\\mathbb{Q}$. So, for any arithmetic progression in $\\mathcal{A}$, we have $a_1 \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ and $d \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThis means that the ordered pair $(a_1, d)$ that uniquely defines each progression is an element of the Cartesian product of the set of rational numbers with itself, which is $\\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe bijection can be formally defined as a function $f: \\mathcal{A} \\to \\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$, where $f$ maps the progression $(a_1, a_1+d, a_1+2d, \\dots)$ to the ordered pair $(a_1, d)$. This function is clearly injective (one-to-one) because if two progressions map to the same pair $(a_1, d)$, they must be the same progression. It is also surjective (onto) because for any pair $(a_1, d) \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$, there exists a corresponding arithmetic progression in $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\nSince there is a bijection between the set $\\mathcal{A}$ and the set $\\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$, these two sets have the same cardinality. Therefore, to determine the cardinality of $\\mathcal{A}$, we must determine the cardinality of $\\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nFirst, we recall a fundamental result from set theory: the set of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$, is countably infinite. A set is countably infinite if it can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$.\n\nNext, we use another key theorem from set theory: the Cartesian product of two countable sets is also a countable set. Since $\\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, the set $\\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$ must also be countable.\n\nSince the set $\\mathbb{Q}$ is infinite, the Cartesian product $\\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$ is also infinite. For example, pairs of the form $(n, 0)$ where $n$ is an integer form an infinite subset. Therefore, $\\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$ is not finite; it is countably infinite.\n\nBecause the set $\\mathcal{A}$ has the same cardinality as $\\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$, we conclude that $\\mathcal{A}$ is a countably infinite set.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. $\\mathcal{A}$ is a finite set. This is incorrect, as there are infinitely many rational numbers to choose for $a_1$ and $d$.\nB. $\\mathcal{A}$ is a countably infinite set. This aligns with our derivation.\nC. $\\mathcal{A}$ has the same cardinality as the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$. This is incorrect. The set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ is uncountably infinite, whereas we found $\\mathcal{A}$ to be countably infinite.\nD. $\\mathcal{A}$ has a cardinality strictly greater than the cardinality of the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$. This is incorrect. The cardinality of $\\mathcal{A}$ is much smaller than that of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThus, the correct statement is that $\\mathcal{A}$ is a countably infinite set.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2295286"}, {"introduction": "Some infinite sets seem far too vast to be countable.

Combined with the earlier observation that $S$ is not finite, this shows that $S$ is countably infinite, so option B is correct.\n\nOption C is false because $S$ is countable. Option D is false because the power set $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N})$ has cardinality $2^{\\aleph_{0}}$, which is uncountable by Cantor's theorem, whereas $S$ has cardinality $\\aleph_{0}$.

This final practice uses the familiar concept of decimal expansions to highlight the breathtaking difference in size between various infinite sets. By examining sets of numbers defined by simple rules about their decimal digits, you will discover how a subtle change in a set's definition can cause its cardinality to jump from countable to uncountable, a foundational concept first explored by Georg Cantor [@problem_id:1299950].", "problem": "Consider the following three sets of real numbers in the interval $(0, 1)$:\n\n-   Let $S_1$ be the set of all real numbers in $(0, 1)$ whose decimal expansion contains only the digit '1'.\n-   Let $S_2$ be the set of all real numbers in $(0, 1)$ whose decimal expansion contains only the digits '1' and '2'.\n-   Let $S_3$ be the set of all real numbers in $(0, 1)$ whose decimal expansion is terminating (i.e., contains only a finite number of non-zero digits).\n\nWhich of these sets are uncountable?\n\nA. $S_1$ only\nB. $S_2$ only\nC. $S_3$ only\nD. $S_1$ and $S_2$\nE. $S_2$ and $S_3$\nF.

A standard decimal expansion is an infinite sequence of digits $(d_1, d_2, d_3, \\dots)$. For this sequence to contain *only* the digit '1', every digit $d_k$ must be '1'. There is only one such sequence: $(1, 1, 1, \\dots)$. This corresponds to the single real number $0.111\\dots = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1 \\cdot 10^{-k} = 1/9$. Therefore, $S_1 = \\{1/9\\}$.

The set of all infinite sequences over a two-element alphabet is uncountable by Cantor’s diagonal argument.
