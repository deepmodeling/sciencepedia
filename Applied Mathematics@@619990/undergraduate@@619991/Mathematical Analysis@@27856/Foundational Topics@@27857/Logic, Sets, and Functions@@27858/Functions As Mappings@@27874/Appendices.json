This first practice explores injectivity, not as a global property, but as a local one that depends on the chosen interval. By analyzing the function $f(x) = (x^2 - 4)^2$, you will use calculus to determine the maximal intervals on which the function is one-to-one, providing a tangible link between a function's graphical behavior and its mapping properties [@problem_id:1300294].", "problem": "Consider the function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by the formula $f(x) = (x^2 - 4)^2$. A function is said to be injective (or one-to-one) on an interval $I$ if for every pair of distinct numbers $x_1, x_2 \\in I$, it holds that $f(x_1) \\neq f(x_2)$. An interval $I$ is a *maximal* such interval if it is not a proper subset of any larger interval on which the function is also injective.\n\nIdentify the complete collection of all maximal intervals on which the function $f$ is injective.\n\nA.

Since $f$ is a polynomial, it is continuous and differentiable on $\\mathbb{R}$. A continuous function on an interval is injective if and only if it is strictly monotone on that interval. Therefore, we determine intervals of strict monotonicity via the derivative.\n\nCompute the derivative:\n$$\nf'(x) = 2(x^{2} - 4)\\cdot 2x = 4x(x^{2} - 4) = 4x(x - 2)(x + 2).\n$$\nThe critical points are $x = -2, 0, 2$. Determine the sign of $f'(x)$ on the intervals determined by these points:\n- For $x \\in (-\\infty, -2)$: $x < 0$, $x - 2 < 0$, $x + 2 < 0$, so $f'(x) < 0$; $f$ is strictly decreasing.\n- For $x \\in (-2, 0)$: $x < 0$, $x - 2 < 0$, $x + 2 > 0$, so $f'(x) > 0$; $f$ is strictly increasing.\n- For $x \\in (0, 2)$: $x > 0$, $x - 2 < 0$, $x + 2 > 0$, so $f'(x) < 0$; $f$ is strictly decreasing.\n- For $x \\in (2, \\infty)$: $x > 0$, $x - 2 > 0$, $x + 2 > 0$, so $f'(x) > 0$; $f$ is strictly increasing.\n\nThus $f$ is strictly monotone (and hence injective) on each of the open intervals $(-\\infty, -2)$, $(-2, 0)$, $(0, 2)$, and $(2, \\infty)$. Including the endpoints at the critical points preserves injectivity on each such segment because the function is monotone on each open interval and the endpoint contributes a unique extremal value within that segment. Specifically:\n- $(-\\infty, -2]$ remains injective since $f$ is strictly decreasing on $(-\\infty, -2)$ and $x = -2$ is a local minimum on the left branch.\n- $[-2, 0]$ remains injective since $f$ is strictly increasing on $(-2, 0)$ and includes the endpoint values without duplication.\n- $[0, 2]$ remains injective since $f$ is strictly decreasing on $(0, 2)$ and includes the endpoint values without duplication.\n- $[2, \\infty)$ remains injective since $f$ is strictly increasing on $(2, \\infty)$ and $x = 2$ is a local minimum on the right branch.\n\nEach of these intervals is maximal because extending any of them past a critical point would include a region where the monotonicity reverses, producing two distinct points with the same function value (by continuity and the presence of a local extremum), thereby violating injectivity.
