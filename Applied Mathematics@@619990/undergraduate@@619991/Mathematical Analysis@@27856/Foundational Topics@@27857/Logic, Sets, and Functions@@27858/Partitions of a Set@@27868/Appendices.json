The partition of a set under an equivalence relation is the set of its equivalence classes. An equivalence class containing an element is the subset of all elements in the set that are equivalent to it. Therefore, our task is to group the polynomials in $P$ according to their degree.\n\nThe set of polynomials is $P = \\{x^2+1, 3x-2, 5, x^3, 2x, 4x^3+x\\}$.\n\nFirst, we must find the degree of each polynomial in the set $P$. The degree of a polynomial is the highest exponent of its variable. The degree of a non-zero constant polynomial is 0.\n\nLet's compute the degree for each element of $P$:\n1.  For the polynomial $p_1(x) = x^2+1$, the highest power of $x$ is 2. So, $\\deg(p_1(x)) = 2$.\n2.  For the polynomial $p_2(x) = 3x-2$, which can be written as $3x^1-2$, the highest power of $x$ is 1. So, $\\deg(p_2(x)) = 1$.\n3.  For the polynomial $p_3(x) = 5$, which is a non-zero constant, the degree is 0. So, $\\deg(p_3(x)) = 0$.\n4.  For the polynomial $p_4(x) = x^3$, the highest power of $x$ is 3. So, $\\deg(p_4(x)) = 3$.\n5.  For the polynomial $p_5(x) = 2x$, which can be written as $2x^1$, the highest power of $x$ is 1. So, $\\deg(p_5(x)) = 1$.\n6.  For the polynomial $p_6(x) = 4x^3+x$, the highest power of $x$ is 3. So, $\\deg(p_6(x)) = 3$.\n\nNow, we group the polynomials that have the same degree. These groups are the equivalence classes.\n\n-   **Degree 0:** The only polynomial with degree 0 is $5$. The equivalence class is $\\{5\\}$.\n-   **Degree 1:** The polynomials with degree 1 are $3x-2$ and $2x$.

The quadrants are pairwise disjoint because any point in $Q_{i}$ has fixed signs of $x$ and $y$ that are incompatible with those in any other quadrant. No quadrant contains any point with $x=0$ or $y=0$, so all quadrants are disjoint from all semi-axes and from $O$. Among the semi-axes, any two distinct semi-axes require mutually incompatible equalities and inequalities: for example, $A_{x}^{+}$ requires $y=0$ and $x>0$, whereas $A_{y}^{+}$ requires $x=0$ and $y>0$, which cannot both hold; similarly $A_{x}^{+}\\cap A_{x}^{-}=\\varnothing$ since $x>0$ and $x<0$ cannot both hold.

The smallest such relation is the equivalence closure of the initial set of pairs $R = \\{(S_1, S_3), (S_3, S_5)\\}$.
