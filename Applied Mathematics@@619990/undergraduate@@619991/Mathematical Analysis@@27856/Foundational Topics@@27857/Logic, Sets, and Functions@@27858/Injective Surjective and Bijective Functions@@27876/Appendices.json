A function is strictly monotonic if it is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing everywhere in its domain.\n\nThis condition on strict monotonicity can be analyzed using the function's first derivative. A differentiable function $f$ is strictly increasing on an interval if its derivative $f'(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x$ in the interval, and the set of points where $f'(x) = 0$ does not form a subinterval. Similarly, $f$ is strictly decreasing if $f'(x) \\leq 0$ under the same condition for the points where the derivative is zero.\n\nThe given function is $f(x) = x^3 + cx + 1$. This is a polynomial function, so it is differentiable everywhere on $\\mathbb{R}$.\nFirst, we compute the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^3 + cx + 1) = 3x^2 + c\n$$\n\nNow, we investigate the two cases for strict monotonicity.\n\nCase 1: The function $f(x)$ is strictly increasing.\nFor $f(x)$ to be strictly increasing on $\\mathbb{R}$, we must have $f'(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nSubstituting the expression for the derivative, we get the inequality:\n$$\n3x^2 + c \\geq 0\n$$\nThis inequality must hold for all real numbers $x$. To find the condition on $c$, we can rearrange it to be $c \\geq -3x^2$.\nWe need to find the value of $c$ that satisfies this for all possible values of $x$. This means $c$ must be greater than or equal to the maximum possible value of the expression $-3x^2$.\nThe term $x^2$ is always non-negative, so its minimum value is $0$ (which occurs at $x=0$). Therefore, the maximum value of $-3x^2$ is $0$ (at $x=0$).\nFor the inequality $c \\geq -3x^2$ to hold for all $x$, $c$ must be greater than or equal to the maximum value of $-3x^2$.\nThus, we must have:\n$$\nc \\geq 0\n$$\nIf $c > 0$, then $f'(x) = 3x^2 + c$ is strictly positive for all $x$, so $f$ is strictly increasing.\nIf $c = 0$, then $f'(x) = 3x^2$. In this case, $f'(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x$, and $f'(x)=0$ only at the single point $x=0$. Since the derivative is zero only at an isolated point and not over an interval, the function is still strictly increasing and therefore injective.\nSo, the condition for $f(x)$ to be strictly increasing is $c \\geq 0$.\n\nCase 2: The function $f(x)$ is strictly decreasing.\nFor $f(x)$ to be strictly decreasing on $\\mathbb{R}$, we must have $f'(x) \\leq 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nSubstituting the expression for the derivative, we get the inequality:\n$$\n3x^2 + c \\leq 0\n$$\nThis inequality can be rearranged as $3x^2 \\leq -c$.\nThe expression on the left side, $3x^2$, can take any non-negative value. As $|x|$ becomes very large, $3x^2$ grows without bound. For any fixed value of $c$ (and thus $-c$), we can always find an $x$ large enough such that $3x^2 > -c$. For example, if $x > \\sqrt{|c|/3}$, the inequality fails. Therefore, there is no real number $c$ for which $f'(x) \\leq 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The function can never be strictly decreasing on its entire domain.\n\nCombining the results from both cases, the function $f(x)$ is injective if and only if it is strictly increasing, which occurs if and only if $c \\geq 0$.\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2302547"}, {"introduction": "The concepts of injectivity and surjectivity extend far beyond functions on real numbers, forming a cornerstone of abstract algebra.
