The range of the Dirichlet function $g(x)$ is the set $\\{0, 1\\}$.\nThus, the function $h(x)$ can be written as:\n$$\nh(x) = f(g(x)) = \\begin{cases}\nf(1) & \\text{if } x \\text{ is a rational number} \\\\\nf(0) & \\text{if } x \\text{ is an irrational number}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFor $h(x)$ to be continuous at an arbitrary point $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the limit of $h(x)$ as $x$ approaches $x_0$ must exist and be equal to $h(x_0)$. That is, $\\lim_{x \\to x_0} h(x) = h(x_0)$.\n\nWe will use the sequential criterion for limits. For the limit $\\lim_{x \\to x_0} h(x)$ to exist, the function $h(x)$ must approach the same value along every sequence $(x_n)$ that converges to $x_0$.\n\nLet's pick an arbitrary point $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We know that the set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ and the set of irrational numbers $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Q}$ are both dense in $\\mathbb{R}$.

For every term $q_n$ in this sequence, $g(q_n) = 1$, so $h(q_n) = f(g(q_n)) = f(1)$.

For every term $i_n$ in this sequence, $g(i_n) = 0$, so $h(i_n) = f(g(i_n)) = f(0)$. Therefore, the limit along this sequence is:\n$$\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} h(i_n) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f(0) = f(0)\n$$\n\nFor the limit $\\lim_{x \\to x_0} h(x)$ to exist, the limits along all sequences converging to $x_0$ must be equal. In particular, the limits along our chosen rational and irrational sequences must be equal. This gives us the necessary condition:\n$$\nf(1) = f(0)\n$$\n\nNow we check if this condition is sufficient. Suppose that $f(0) = f(1)$. Let this common value be $C$.

This is a sufficient condition (as it implies $f(0)=f(1)$), but it is not necessary. For example, if $f(x) = x^2 - x$, then $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 1^2 - 1 = 0$. So $f(0) = f(1)$, which makes $h(x)$ continuous, but $f(x)$ is not a constant function.\nB. $f(0) = f(1)$. As we derived, this condition is both necessary and sufficient.\nC. $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 1$. If this were true, then $h(x) = g(x)$, which is nowhere continuous.\nD. $f(x)$ must be the identity function. This is a special case of C, so it also results in a nowhere continuous function $h(x)=g(x)$.\nE. $h(x)$ is necessarily discontinuous everywhere. This is false, as shown by the sufficiency of the condition $f(0)=f(1)$.\n\nThus, the correct option is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1289892"}]}
