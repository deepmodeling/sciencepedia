The equivalence class of an element $(a, b) \\in S$, denoted by $[(a,b)]$, is the set of all pairs $(c, d) \\in S$ such that $(a, b) \\sim (c, d)$.\nUsing the definition of the relation, we can write the equivalence class of $(a, b)$ as:\n$$ [(a, b)] = \\{ (c, d) \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z} \\mid c+d \\equiv a+b \\pmod{15} \\} $$\n\nFrom this definition, we can see that two pairs $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$ belong to the same equivalence class if and only if the sum of their components, $a+b$ and $c+d$, have the same remainder when divided by 15. The equivalence classes are therefore uniquely determined by the value of the sum of the components modulo 15.\n\nLet $k = (a+b) \\pmod{15}$.

This shows that none of the classes $C_k$ are empty.\n\nSince the equivalence classes are determined by the remainder of the sum of their components modulo 15, and there are exactly 15 possible remainders (0 through 14), there are exactly 15 distinct equivalence classes.\n\nThe fact that the underlying set $\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$ is infinite is irrelevant to the number of equivalence classes. Each equivalence class is itself an infinite set, but the number of such sets is finite. For example, the class $C_0$ contains pairs like $(0,0)$, $(1,-1)$, $(15,0)$, $(14,1)$, etc., all of which have component sums that are multiples of 15.\n\nThe number of distinct equivalence classes corresponds to the number of possible values for the expression $(a+b) \\pmod{15}$.
