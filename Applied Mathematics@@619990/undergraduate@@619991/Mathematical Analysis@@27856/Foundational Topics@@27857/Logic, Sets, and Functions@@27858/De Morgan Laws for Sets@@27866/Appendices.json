The system monitors a stream of network packets. An alert is triggered if a packet meets both of the following criteria:\n1. The packet originates from an external, non-whitelisted IP address.\n2. The packet's payload contains a signature matching a known malware pattern.\n\nLet `U` be the universal set of all network packets scanned by the system.\nLet `A` be the subset of packets originating from an external, non-whitelisted IP address.\nLet `B` be the subset of packets whose payload contains a known malware signature.\n\nA packet is considered \"high-risk\" if it belongs to the set `A ∩ B`. All other packets are considered \"low-risk\". The set of all low-risk packets is therefore the complement of the high-risk set, `(A ∩ B)ᶜ`.\n\nAn engineer is tasked with configuring a logging rule to record every packet that is classified as \"low-risk\".

The expression $(X \\cup Y) \\setminus (X \\cap Y)$ is the definition of the symmetric difference of sets $X$ and $Y$, often denoted $X \\Delta Y$.\nIn our case, the set of unlogged packets is the symmetric difference of $A^{c}$ and $B^{c}$.\n$$ \\text{Unlogged packets} = A^{c} \\Delta B^{c} = (A^{c} \\setminus B^{c}) \\cup (B^{c} \\setminus A^{c}) $$\nWe can simplify these terms using the identity $X \\setminus Y = X \\cap Y^{c}$.\nThe first term is $A^{c} \\setminus B^{c} = A^{c} \\cap (B^{c})^{c} = A^{c} \\cap B$.\nThe second term is $B^{c} \\setminus A^{c} = B^{c} \\cap (A^{c})^{c} = B^{c} \\cap A$.\nCombining these, the set of unlogged packets is:\n$$\\text{Unlogged packets} = (A^{c} \\cap B) \\cup (A \\cap B^{c})$$\nThis expression represents the set of packets that satisfy exactly one of the two conditions: either they are from an external source but have no malware signature ($A \\cap B^{c}$), or they are not from an external source but do contain a malware signature ($A^{c} \\cap B$).
