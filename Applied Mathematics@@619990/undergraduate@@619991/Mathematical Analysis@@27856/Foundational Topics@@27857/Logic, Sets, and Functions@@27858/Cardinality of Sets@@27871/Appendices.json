This practice explores that very question, demonstrating one of the most counter-intuitive and beautiful properties of infinite sets. By constructing an explicit bijection, you will learn a classic technique, often compared to Hilbert's Paradox of the Grand Hotel, for rearranging an infinite collection of points to prove two sets have the same cardinality [@problem_id:1285592].", "problem": "In set theory, two sets are said to have the same cardinality if there exists a bijection between them. A bijection is a function that is both one-to-one (injective) and onto (surjective).\n\nConsider the closed interval $S = [0,1]$ and the half-open interval $T = [0,1)$. These two sets appear very similar, differing only by the single point $\\{1\\}$.\n\nWhich of the following function definitions describes a bijection $f: S \\to T$?\n\nA. $f(x) = x$\n\nB. $f(x) = \\begin{cases} x & \\text{if } x \\in [0,1) \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } x = 1 \\end{cases}$\n\nC. $f(x) = \\frac{x}{2}$\n\nD. Let the set $A$ be defined as $A = \\{ \\frac{1}{n} \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N}, n \\ge 1 \\}$. The function is defined as:\n$$ f(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{n+1} & \\text{if } x = \\frac{1}{n} \\text{ for some } n \\in \\mathbb{N}, n \\ge 1 \\\\ x & \\text{if } x \\in S \\setminus A \\end{cases} $$", "solution": "To determine which function is a bijection from the set $S=[0,1]$ to the set $T=[0,1)$, we must analyze each option to see if it satisfies the properties of a function mapping $S$ to $T$ and if it is both injective and surjective.\n\nOption A: $f(x) = x$.\nA function $f: S \\to T$ must map every element of the domain $S$ to an element in the codomain $T$. Let's consider the point $x=1$, which is in the domain $S$. The function gives $f(1)=1$. However, the codomain is $T=[0,1)$, which does not include the value $1$. Therefore, this definition does not describe a function from $S$ to $T$.\n\nOption B: $f(x) = \\begin{cases} x & \\text{if } x \\in [0,1) \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } x = 1 \\end{cases}$.\nThis function maps every element of $S$ to an element in $T$. For $x \\in [0,1)$, $f(x)=x \\in [0,1) = T$. For $x=1$, $f(1)=0 \\in T$. So it is a valid function from $S$ to $T$.\nNow, let's check for injectivity. A function is injective if distinct inputs produce distinct outputs. Consider the inputs $x_1=0$ and $x_2=1$. These are distinct elements of $S$.\n$f(x_1) = f(0) = 0$.\n$f(x_2) = f(1) = 0$.\nSince $x_1 \\ne x_2$ but $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, the function is not injective. Therefore, it is not a bijection.\n\nOption C: $f(x) = \\frac{x}{2}$.\nThis function maps every element of $S=[0,1]$ to an element in $T=[0,1)$. If $x \\in [0,1]$, then $f(x) = x/2 \\in [0, 1/2]$. Since $[0, 1/2]$ is a subset of $[0,1)$, this is a valid function from $S$ to $T$.\nLet's check for surjectivity. A function is surjective if every element in the codomain $T$ is the image of at least one element in the domain $S$. The range of this function is the set of all possible outputs, which is $[0, 1/2]$.\nConsider the element $y = 0.75$, which is in the codomain $T=[0,1)$. For $f$ to be surjective, there must be an $x \\in S$ such that $f(x) = 0.75$. This would mean $x/2 = 0.75$, which solves to $x=1.5$. However, $x=1.5$ is not in the domain $S=[0,1]$. Thus, there is no element in the domain that maps to $0.75$. The function is not surjective. Therefore, it is not a bijection.\n\nOption D: Let $A = \\{1, 1/2, 1/3, \\ldots \\}$. $f(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{n+1} & \\text{if } x = \\frac{1}{n} \\in A \\\\ x & \\text{if } x \\in S \\setminus A \\end{cases}$.\nThis construct is a classic example of how to handle a single \"extra\" point, often likened to Hilbert's hotel paradox.\n\nFirst, let's check if it is a valid function from $S$ to $T$.\nIf $x\\in A$, then $x=1/n$ for some positive integer $n$. The output is $f(x)=1/(n+1)$. Since $n\\ge1$, we have $n+1 \\ge 2$, so $0 < 1/(n+1) \\le 1/2$. This output is in $T=[0,1)$.\nIf $x \\in S \\setminus A$, then $x \\in [0,1]$ but $x$ is not of the form $1/n$. This means $x \\in [0,1)$. For these values, $f(x)=x$, and since $x \\in [0,1)$, the output is in $T$.\nSo, the function correctly maps all elements of $S$ to elements of $T$.\n\nSecond, let's check for injectivity. Let $x_1, x_2 \\in S$ such that $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$.\nCase 1: $x_1, x_2 \\in A$. Then $x_1=1/n_1$ and $x_2=1/n_2$. $f(x_1)=1/(n_1+1)$ and $f(x_2)=1/(n_2+1)$. If $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$, then $1/(n_1+1)=1/(n_2+1)$, which implies $n_1=n_2$, so $x_1=x_2$.\nCase 2: $x_1, x_2 \\in S \\setminus A$. Then $f(x_1)=x_1$ and $f(x_2)=x_2$. If $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$, then $x_1=x_2$.\nCase 3: $x_1 \\in A$ and $x_2 \\in S \\setminus A$. Then $f(x_1)=1/(n_1+1)$ for some $n_1 \\ge 1$. This means $f(x_1)$ is in the set $\\{1/2, 1/3, 1/4, \\ldots \\}$. On the other hand, $f(x_2)=x_2$. Since $x_2 \\in S \\setminus A$, $x_2$ cannot be in the set $\\{1/2, 1/3, 1/4, \\ldots \\}$. Therefore, it is impossible for $f(x_1)$ to equal $f(x_2)$.\nIn all cases where $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. The function is injective.\n\nThird, let's check for surjectivity. Let $y \\in T=[0,1)$. We need to find an $x \\in S$ such that $f(x)=y$.\nCase 1: $y$ is in the set $\\{1/2, 1/3, 1/4, \\ldots \\}$. Then $y=1/k$ for some integer $k \\ge 2$. We can write $k=m+1$ where $m=k-1 \\ge 1$. To get the output $y=1/(m+1)$, we need to find an input $x$ that maps to it. The function rule states that for an input $x=1/m$, the output is $f(1/m)=1/(m+1)=y$. Since $m \\ge 1$, this $x=1/m$ is in the set $A$ and therefore in the domain $S$. So we have found a pre-image.\nCase 2: $y \\in [0,1)$ and $y$ is not in the set $\\{1/2, 1/3, 1/4, \\ldots \\}$. Let's try the pre-image $x=y$. Since $y \\in [0,1)$, $x=y$ is in the domain $S=[0,1]$. Does $x=y$ belong to the set $A=\\{1, 1/2, 1/3, \\ldots\\}$? No, because $y$ is not of the form $1/k$ for $k \\ge 2$, and $y \\ne 1$. So $x=y$ is in $S \\setminus A$. According to the function definition for this case, $f(x)=x$. Thus, $f(y)=y$. We have found a pre-image.\nSince every element $y$ in the codomain $T$ has a pre-image in the domain $S$, the function is surjective.\n\nSince the function is both injective and surjective, it is a bijection.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1285592"}, {"introduction": "While some infinite sets are unimaginably large, many can be \"counted\" just like the natural numbers.
