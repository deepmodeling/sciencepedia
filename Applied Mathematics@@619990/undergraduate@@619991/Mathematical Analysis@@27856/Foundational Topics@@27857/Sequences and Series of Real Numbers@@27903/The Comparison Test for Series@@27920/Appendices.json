This exercise is a foundational practice in applying the Limit Comparison Test. It challenges you to determine how a parameter $p$ affects the convergence of a series whose general term is a rational function of $n$. The key is to correctly identify the dominant part of the expression and compare it to a suitable $p$-series, a fundamental skill for analyzing a wide range of series.

Consider one such model where the total effect is described by the sum of an infinite number of terms.
