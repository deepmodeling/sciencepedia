The set of all possible distances from the origin to points on the curve is a non-empty set of real numbers that is bounded below (e.g., by 0).

A point on the curve has coordinates $(x, \\exp(x))$. The distance $d$ from this point to the origin is given by the distance formula:\n$$d(x) = \\sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (\\exp(x)-0)^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\exp(2x)}$$\nFinding the point that minimizes the distance $d(x)$ is equivalent to finding the point that minimizes the square of the distance, $D(x) = d(x)^2$, because $d(x)$ is always non-negative. This simplifies the problem by removing the square root. Let the function we want to minimize be:\n$$D(x) = x^2 + \\exp(2x)$$\nThe question is whether this function $D(x)$ is guaranteed to have an absolute minimum on the interval $x \\in [-1, 1]$.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A:** This option suggests that the existence of a minimum is guaranteed because the derivative $D'(x)$ must have a zero. While finding where the derivative is zero is a standard technique for locating local extrema (critical points), it does not, by itself, guarantee the existence of an absolute minimum on a closed interval. The absolute minimum could occur at one of the endpoints ($x=-1$ or $x=1$), where the derivative is not necessarily zero. The guarantee of existence for a minimum comes from a more fundamental theorem, not from the mechanics of finding it using calculus. Therefore, this justification is flawed.\n\n**Option B:** This option invokes the completeness axiom. The set of distances, $S = \\{d(x) \\mid x \\in [-1, 1]\\}$, is indeed a non-empty set of real numbers that is bounded below by 0. The completeness axiom states that such a set must have a greatest lower bound, or infimum. Let $m = \\inf(S)$. However, the axiom does not guarantee that this infimum is actually an element of the set $S$. In other words, it doesn't guarantee that there exists a point $c \\in [-1, 1]$ such that $d(c) = m$. The property that the infimum is attained is known as the minimum property and requires additional conditions on the function and its domain. So, this justification is subtly incomplete.\n\n**Option C:** This option relies on the Extreme Value Theorem (EVT). The EVT states that if a real-valued function is continuous on a closed, bounded interval (a compact set), then it must attain an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum on that interval. Let's check the conditions for our function $D(x) = x^2 + \\exp(2x)$ on the interval $[-1, 1]$.\n1.  **Continuity:** The function $g(x) = x^2$ is a polynomial and is continuous everywhere. The function $h(x) = \\exp(2x)$ is an exponential function and is also continuous everywhere. The sum of two continuous functions is continuous. Therefore, $D(x) = g(x) + h(x)$ is continuous on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, and specifically on the interval $[-1, 1]$.\n2.  **Domain:** The domain is specified as the interval $[-1, 1]$, which is both closed (it includes its endpoints) and bounded.\nSince both conditions of the EVT are satisfied, the theorem guarantees that $D(x)$ must attain an absolute minimum value at some point $c \\in [-1, 1]$. This minimum value of the squared distance corresponds to the minimum distance itself. Thus, a point of minimum distance exists. This is a correct and complete justification.\n\n**Option D:** This option claims that monotonicity is the key property. While $f(x) = \\exp(x)$ is a strictly increasing function, monotonicity is not the fundamental reason a minimum distance must exist. For example, the function $y = \\cos(x)$ on $[-\\pi, \\pi]$ is not monotonic, yet a point of minimum distance to the origin still exists. The statement that a monotonic function on a closed interval has a point of minimum distance is true, but this is a consequence of the fact that such a function is continuous (with at most jump discontinuities, but $\\exp(x)$ is everywhere continuous) on a compact set. Therefore, this explanation is not as fundamental as the one given in option C.\n\n**Option E:** This option incorrectly applies the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT). The IVT states that a continuous function on an interval takes on all values *between* its values at the endpoints. It says nothing about achieving a minimum or maximum value. For example, the function $f(x)=x$ on the open interval $(0,1)$ takes on all values between 0 and 1, but never attains a minimum or maximum. The IVT is concerned with the \"connectedness\" of the function's image, not its \"boundedness\" or the existence of extrema.\n\n**Conclusion:** Option C provides the most accurate and rigorous argument by correctly identifying the relevant function ($D(x)$), its essential property (continuity), the nature of the domain (closed and bounded), and the correct foundational result (The Extreme Value Theorem).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2292918"}, {"introduction": "The behavior of infinite sequences is a central theme in analysis, and completeness plays a crucial role here as well through the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem.
