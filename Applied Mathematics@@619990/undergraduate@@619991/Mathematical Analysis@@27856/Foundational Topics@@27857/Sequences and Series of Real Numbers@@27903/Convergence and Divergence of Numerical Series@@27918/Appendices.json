Let the general term of the series be $a_n = \\frac{1}{n(\\ln n)^2}$. For $n \\ge 2$, all terms $a_n$ are positive.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A:** This option claims convergence because $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_n = 0$. Let's check the limit:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_n = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n(\\ln n)^2} $$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, both $n$ and $\\ln n$ approach infinity. Therefore, the denominator $n(\\ln n)^2$ approaches infinity, and the limit of the fraction is 0.\nHowever, the condition $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_n = 0$ is a necessary condition for convergence, but it is not sufficient. The Test for Divergence states that if the limit is not zero, the series diverges. Since the limit is zero, the test is inconclusive. For example, the harmonic series $\\sum \\frac{1}{n}$ has its terms approaching zero, yet it diverges. Thus, the reasoning in option A is flawed.\n\n**Option B:** This option suggests using the Direct Comparison Test with the harmonic series $\\sum \\frac{1}{n}$. For $n \\ge 3$, we have $\\ln n > \\ln e = 1$, which implies $(\\ln n)^2 > 1$. Therefore, for $n \\ge 3$:\n$$ n(\\ln n)^2 > n $$\nTaking the reciprocal reverses the inequality:\n$$ \\frac{1}{n(\\ln n)^2} < \\frac{1}{n} $$\nWe have shown that the terms of our series are *smaller* than the terms of the divergent harmonic series. The Direct Comparison Test is inconclusive in this situation. To prove divergence by comparison, we would need to find a divergent series whose terms are *smaller* than our series' terms. Thus, option B is incorrect.\n\n**Option E:** This option suggests using the Alternating Series Test. This test applies only to series whose terms alternate in sign. The series $\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n(\\ln n)^2}$ has all positive terms. Therefore, the Alternating Series Test is not applicable. Option E is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:** This option suggests using the Ratio Test. Let's compute the limit of the ratio of consecutive terms:\n$$ L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left| \\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \\right| = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{1}{(n+1)(\\ln(n+1))^2}}{\\frac{1}{n(\\ln n)^2}} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{n}{n+1} \\left( \\frac{\\ln n}{\\ln(n+1)} \\right)^2 $$\nWe can evaluate the limits of the two factors separately:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{n}{n+1} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{1+1/n} = 1 $$\nFor the second factor's limit, we can use L'HÃ´pital's Rule on the base $\\frac{\\ln n}{\\ln(n+1)}$ by considering the corresponding function of a real variable $x$:\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\ln x}{\\ln(x+1)} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{d}{dx}(\\ln x)}{\\frac{d}{dx}(\\ln(x+1))} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{1/x}{1/(x+1)} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{x+1}{x} = 1 $$\nTherefore, the limit of the ratio is $L = 1 \\cdot (1)^2 = 1$. Since the limit is 1, the Ratio Test is inconclusive. Thus, option D is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:** This option suggests using the Integral Test. We define the function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x(\\ln x)^2}$. For the Integral Test to be applicable, $f(x)$ must be continuous, positive, and decreasing on the interval $[2, \\infty)$.\n1.  **Continuity:** For $x \\ge 2$, $x > 0$ and $\\ln x > \\ln 2 > 0$, so the denominator is never zero. The function is a composition of continuous functions, so it is continuous on $[2, \\infty)$.\n2.  **Positivity:** For $x \\ge 2$, $x$, $\\ln x$, and $(\\ln x)^2$ are all positive. Thus, $f(x)$ is positive on $[2, \\infty)$.\n3.  **Decreasing:** Both $x$ and $(\\ln x)^2$ are positive and increasing functions for $x \\ge 2$. Their product, $x(\\ln x)^2$, is also increasing. The reciprocal of a positive increasing function is a decreasing function. So, $f(x)$ is decreasing on $[2, \\infty)$.\n\nThe conditions for the Integral Test are met. We now evaluate the improper integral $\\int_{2}^{\\infty} f(x) \\,dx$:\n$$ \\int_{2}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x(\\ln x)^2} \\,dx = \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\int_{2}^{b} \\frac{1}{x(\\ln x)^2} \\,dx $$\nWe use the substitution $u = \\ln x$, so $du = \\frac{1}{x} \\,dx$. The limits of integration change from $x=2$ to $u=\\ln 2$, and from $x=b$ to $u=\\ln b$.\n$$ \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\int_{\\ln 2}^{\\ln b} \\frac{1}{u^2} \\,du = \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\int_{\\ln 2}^{\\ln b} u^{-2} \\,du $$\nThe antiderivative of $u^{-2}$ is $-u^{-1} = -\\frac{1}{u}$.\n$$ \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{u} \\right]_{\\ln 2}^{\\ln b} = \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\ln b} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\ln 2}\\right) \\right) = \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\ln 2} - \\frac{1}{\\ln b} \\right) $$\nAs $b \\to \\infty$, $\\ln b \\to \\infty$, so $\\frac{1}{\\ln b} \\to 0$. The limit is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\ln 2} - 0 = \\frac{1}{\\ln 2} $$\nSince the improper integral converges to a finite value, the Integral Test states that the series $\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n(\\ln n)^2}$ also converges. This confirms that the statement in option C is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2294275"}]}
