The indices in the original sequence $(c_n)$ are $n = 2k - 1 = 2(2j-1) - 1 = 4j - 3$. The terms are:\n$$ c_{4j-3} = a_{2j-1} = (-1)^{2j-1} = -1 $$\nThis gives the constant subsequence $(-1, -1, -1, \\dots)$, which clearly converges to $-1$. Therefore, $-1$ is a subsequential limit of $(c_n)$.\n\nNow, let's extract a subsequence from $(c_{2k-1})$ by taking only the terms where $k$ is even. Let $k = 2j$ for $j \\ge 1$. The indices in the original sequence $(c_n)$ are $n = 2k - 1 = 2(2j) - 1 = 4j - 1$. The terms are:\n$$ c_{4j-1} = a_{2j} = (-1)^{2j} = 1 $$\nThis gives the constant subsequence $(1, 1, 1, \\dots)$, which converges to $1$.

The set of indices $\\{n_j\\}$ is an infinite subset of $\\mathbb{N}$. By the pigeonhole principle, this set must contain either infinitely many even numbers or infinitely many odd numbers (or both).\n\nCase A: The set of indices $\\{n_j\\}$ contains infinitely many even numbers. Let this infinite set of even indices be $\\{m_k\\}$. Then $(c_{m_k})$ is a subsequence of $(c_{n_j})$. Since $(c_{n_j})$ converges to $L$, its subsequence $(c_{m_k})$ must also converge to $L$. However, $(c_{m_k})$ is also a subsequence of the sequence of all even terms, $(c_{2k})$, which converges to $0$. Since every subsequence of a convergent sequence must converge to the same limit, we must have $L=0$.\n\nCase B: The set of indices $\\{n_j\\}$ contains infinitely many odd numbers. Let this infinite set of odd indices be $\\{p_k\\}$. Then $(c_{p_k})$ is a subsequence of $(c_{n_j})$ and must also converge to $L$. The sequence $(c_{p_k})$ is also a subsequence of the sequence of odd terms, $(c_{2k-1}) = ((-1)^k)$. The only values in this sequence are $-1$ and $1$. For a sequence whose terms are only $-1$ or $1$ to converge to a limit $L$, it must be eventually constant. If it is eventually all $-1$, then $L=-1$. If it is eventually all $1$, then $L=1$. No other limit is possible for a subsequence of $(c_{2k-1})$.\n\nTherefore, any convergent subsequence of $(c_n)$ must converge to one of the values in $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\nThis proves that the complete set of subsequential limits is $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n\nComparing this result with the given choices:\nA. $\\{0, 1\\}$ - Incorrect, misses -1.\nB. $\\{-1, 1\\}$ - Incorrect, misses 0.\nC. $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ - Correct.\nD.
