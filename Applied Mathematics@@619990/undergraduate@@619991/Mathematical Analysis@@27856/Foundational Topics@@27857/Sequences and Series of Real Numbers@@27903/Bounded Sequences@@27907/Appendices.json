For a monotonically increasing sequence that is bounded above, its supremum is equal to its limit. We will first establish that the sequence $(x_n)$ is monotonically increasing and bounded above.\n\nFirst, let's show that the sequence is monotonically increasing, i.e., $x_{n+1} > x_n$ for all $n \\geq 1$.
