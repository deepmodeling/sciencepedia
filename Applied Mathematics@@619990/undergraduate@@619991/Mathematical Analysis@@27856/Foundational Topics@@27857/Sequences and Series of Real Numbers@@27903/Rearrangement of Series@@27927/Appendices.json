This theorem states:\nIf a series $\\sum a_n$ is absolutely convergent, then every rearrangement of the series converges to the *same sum*.\n\nWe can state the contrapositive of this theorem, which is logically equivalent and equally valid:\nIf a convergent series $\\sum a_n$ has a rearrangement that converges to a different sum (or diverges), then the series $\\sum a_n$ is *not* absolutely convergent.\n\nLet's apply this to the information given in the problem. We are given:\n1. The series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n$ converges to a sum $S$.\n2. There exists a rearrangement, $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} b_n$, that converges to a sum $T$.\n3. The sums are different, i.e., $S \\neq T$.\n\nFrom premise (1), we know that $\\sum a_n$ is a convergent series. Premises (2) and (3) tell us that a rearrangement of this convergent series results in a different sum.\n\nAccording to the contrapositive of the Rearrangement Theorem, since a rearrangement of the convergent series $\\sum a_n$ yields a different sum, the series $\\sum a_n$ cannot be absolutely convergent.\n\nBy the definition of absolute convergence, for a series to be \"not absolutely convergent\" means that the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} |a_n|$ does not converge.\n\nSince $|a_n| \\geq 0$ for all $n$, the partial sums of the series $\\sum |a_n|$ form a non-decreasing sequence. A non-decreasing sequence either converges to a finite limit or diverges to infinity. Since we have established that $\\sum |a_n|$ does not converge, it must diverge (to infinity).\n\nTherefore, we can definitively conclude that the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} |a_n|$ diverges. This corresponds to the case where the original series $\\sum a_n$ is conditionally convergent. The behavior described in the problem is, in fact, the defining characteristic of conditionally convergent series, as shown by the Riemann Rearrangement Theorem, which states that a conditionally convergent series can be rearranged to converge to any real number or to diverge.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. The series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} |a_n|$ converges to $|S|$. This is incorrect. If $\\sum |a_n|$ converged, the series would be absolutely convergent, and all rearrangements would have the same sum $S$.\nB. The series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} |a_n|$ converges, but its sum cannot be determined. This is incorrect for the same reason as A; its convergence would imply $S=T$.\nC. The series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} |a_n|$ diverges. This matches our conclusion perfectly.\nD. The behavior of $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} |a_n|$ cannot be determined. This is incorrect because the condition $S \\neq T$ allows for a definitive conclusion.\n\nThus, the only correct conclusion is that the series of absolute values diverges.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1319780"}, {"introduction": "Having established the theoretical distinction between absolute and conditional convergence, we now move to a concrete demonstration of the consequences.
