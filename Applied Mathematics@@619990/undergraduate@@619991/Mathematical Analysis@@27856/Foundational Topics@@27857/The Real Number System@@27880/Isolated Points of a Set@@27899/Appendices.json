First, we must find the set $A$ itself. Then, we apply the definition of an isolated point to each element of $A$.\n\nStep 1: Determine the set $A$.\nThe set $A$ consists of all real numbers $x$ such that $x^2$ is a solution to the equation $y^2 - 13y + 36 = 0$. Let's solve this quadratic equation for $y$. We can factor the polynomial or use the quadratic formula.\nFactoring the quadratic expression: We need two numbers that multiply to 36 and add up to -13. These numbers are -4 and -9.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$$ (y - 4)(y - 9) = 0 $$\nThe solutions for $y$ are $y = 4$ and $y = 9$.\n\nAccording to the problem description, the values of $x^2$ are these solutions. Thus, we have two conditions for the elements $x$ of the set $A$:\n1. $x^2 = 4$\n2. $x^2 = 9$\n\nFrom $x^2 = 4$, we find the real numbers $x = \\sqrt{4}$ and $x = -\\sqrt{4}$, which are $x = 2$ and $x = -2$.\nFrom $x^2 = 9$, we find the real numbers $x = \\sqrt{9}$ and $x = -\\sqrt{9}$, which are $x = 3$ and $x = -3$.\n\nCombining all these possible values for $x$, we construct the set $A$.\n$$ A = \\{-3, -2, 2, 3\\} $$\nThis is a finite set of four distinct points on the real number line.\n\nStep 2: Find the isolated points of $A$.\nWe need to check if each point in $A$ is an isolated point. A point $s \\in A$ is isolated if we can find a small open interval around it that contains no other points from $A$. Let's examine each point in $A$.\n\n- **Consider the point $s = -3$:** The other points in $A$ are $-2, 2, 3$. The closest point to $-3$ in $A$ is $-2$. The distance between them is $|-2 - (-3)| = 1$. If we choose an $\\epsilon$ that is less than this distance, say $\\epsilon = 0.5$, the open interval $(-3 - 0.5, -3 + 0.5) = (-3.5, -2.5)$ will contain $-3$ but no other points from $A$. Specifically, $(-3.5, -2.5) \\cap A = \\{-3\\}$. Therefore, $-3$ is an isolated point of $A$.\n\n- **Consider the point $s = -2$:** The other points in $A$ are $-3, 2, 3$. The distances to the other points are $|-3 - (-2)| = 1$, $|2 - (-2)| = 4$, and $|3 - (-2)| = 5$. The minimum distance to another point in $A$ is 1. If we choose $\\epsilon = 0.5$, the open interval $(-2 - 0.5, -2 + 0.5) = (-2.5, -1.5)$ contains $-2$. Since this interval does not contain $-3, 2,$ or $3$, we have $(-2.5, -1.5) \\cap A = \\{-2\\}$. Therefore, $-2$ is an isolated point of $A$.\n\n- **Consider the point $s = 2$:** The other points in $A$ are $-3, -2, 3$. The distances to the other points are $|-3 - 2| = 5$, $|-2 - 2| = 4$, and $|3 - 2| = 1$. The minimum distance to another point in $A$ is 1. If we choose $\\epsilon = 0.5$, the open interval $(2 - 0.5, 2 + 0.5) = (1.5, 2.5)$ contains $2$. This interval does not contain any other point from $A$. Thus, $(1.5, 2.5) \\cap A = \\{2\\}$. Therefore, $2$ is an isolated point of $A$.\n\n- **Consider the point $s = 3$:** The other points in $A$ are $-3, -2, 2$. The closest point to $3$ in $A$ is $2$. The distance is $|2 - 3| = 1$. If we choose $\\epsilon = 0.5$, the open interval $(3 - 0.5, 3 + 0.5) = (2.5, 3.5)$ contains $3$. This interval does not contain any other point from $A$. So, $(2.5, 3.5) \\cap A = \\{3\\}$. Therefore, $3$ is an isolated point of $A$.\n\nIn general, every point in a finite subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ is an isolated point. Since all four points in $A$ satisfy the definition of an isolated point, the set of all isolated points of $A$ is the set $A$ itself.\nSet of isolated points = $\\{-3, -2, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nStep 3: Compare with the given options.\nThe calculated set of isolated points is $\\{-3, -2, 2, 3\\}$, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1306209"}, {"introduction": "A key skill in mathematical analysis is to test your intuition against rigorous definitions.

Since there are infinitely many such points, this set has infinitely many isolated points.\n- The point $0$ is a limit point of the set, not an isolated point. Any open interval $(-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$ around $0$ contains points of the form $\\frac{1}{n}$ for sufficiently large $n$ (specifically, for any $n > 1/\\epsilon$).\nSince $S_A$ has infinitely many isolated points, it is not the correct answer.\n\n**B. $S_B = \\mathbb{Q}$**\nThe set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ is infinite. Let's check for isolated points.\nThe set of rational numbers is dense in the real numbers. This means that for any rational number $q$ and any $\\epsilon > 0$, the open interval $(q - \\epsilon, q + \\epsilon)$ contains infinitely many other rational numbers. Therefore, it's impossible to find an $\\epsilon > 0$ such that $(q - \\epsilon, q + \\epsilon) \\cap \\mathbb{Q} = \\{q\\}$. This means that no point in $\\mathbb{Q}$ is an isolated point. The set has zero isolated points. This is not the correct answer.\n\n**C. $S_C = [0, 1] \\cup \\{2, 3\\}$**\nThis set is infinite because it contains the interval $[0, 1]$.\n- Consider any point $s_0 \\in [0, 1]$. For any $\\epsilon > 0$, the interval $(s_0 - \\epsilon, s_0 + \\epsilon)$ will always contain other points from the interval $[0, 1]$. For instance, $(s_0 - \\epsilon, s_0 + \\epsilon) \\cap [0, 1]$ is itself an interval (or a half-open interval if $s_0=0$ or $s_0=1$) containing infinitely many points. So, no point in $[0, 1]$ is isolated.\n- Consider the point $s_0 = 2$. We need to find an $\\epsilon > 0$ such that $(2-\\epsilon, 2+\\epsilon) \\cap S_C = \\{2\\}$. The closest other points in $S_C$ are $1$ and $3$. The distance to $1$ is $1$, and the distance to $3$ is $1$. If we choose, for example, $\\epsilon = 0.5$, the interval is $(1.5, 2.5)$. The intersection of $(1.5, 2.5)$ with $S_C = [0, 1] \\cup \\{2, 3\\}$ is exactly $\\{2\\}$. So, $2$ is an isolated point.\n- Consider the point $s_0 = 3$. Similarly, we can choose $\\epsilon = 0.5$. The interval is $(2.5, 3.5)$. The intersection of $(2.5, 3.5)$ with $S_C$ is exactly $\\{3\\}$. So, $3$ is also an isolated point.\nThis set has two isolated points. This is not the correct answer.\n\n**D. $S_D = \\{ n + \\frac{1}{m} \\mid n \\in \\{0, 1\\}, m \\in \\mathbb{N} \\}$**\nThis set is the union of two sequences: $A_0 = \\{\\frac{1}{m} \\mid m \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} = \\{1, 1/2, 1/3, ...\\}$ and $A_1 = \\{1 + \\frac{1}{m} \\mid m \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} = \\{2, 3/2, 4/3, ...\\}$. The set $S_D$ is infinite.\nThe sequence $A_0$ is contained in the interval $(0, 1]$ and accumulates at 0. The sequence $A_1$ is in $(1, 2]$ and accumulates at 1. Note that the limit points 0 and 1 are not in $S_D$.\nEvery point in $A_0$ is separated from other points in $A_0$ by a finite distance. The distance from any point in $A_0$ to any point in $A_1$ is also bounded below by a positive number. Specifically, for any $s \\in S_D$, we can find an $\\epsilon > 0$ that isolates it. For example, take $s_0 = 1 + \\frac{1}{m}$. The nearest points in its own sequence are $1+\\frac{1}{m-1}$ and $1+\\frac{1}{m+1}$. The nearest points in the other sequence are in $(0, 1]$. The distance is $|(1+\\frac{1}{m}) - \\frac{1}{k}| > 0$ for any $k \\geq 1$. In fact, for $k=1$, the point is $1$, and the distance is $1/m$. For any other points, the distance is larger. We can always find a small enough neighborhood containing only $s_0$. Every point in $S_D$ is an isolated point. The set has infinitely many isolated points. This is not the correct answer.\n\n**E. $S_E = \\{ \\sin(x) \\mid x \\in [0, \\pi/2] \\} \\cup \\{2 \\}$**\nFirst, let's identify the set $A = \\{ \\sin(x) \\mid x \\in [0, \\pi/2] \\}$. The function $f(x) = \\sin(x)$ is continuous and monotonically increasing on the closed interval $[0, \\pi/2]$. Therefore, its image is the closed interval $[\\sin(0), \\sin(\\pi/2)] = [0, 1]$.\nSo, the set is $S_E = [0, 1] \\cup \\{2\\}$.\nThis set is infinite because it contains the interval $[0, 1]$.\n- As established in the analysis of option C, no point in the interval $[0, 1]$ is an isolated point of $S_E$. Any neighborhood of a point in $[0, 1]$ contains other points from $[0, 1]$.\n- Consider the point $s_0 = 2$. The closest point in $S_E$ is $1$. The distance is $2 - 1 = 1$. If we choose $\\epsilon = 0.5$, the open interval $(2 - 0.5, 2 + 0.5) = (1.5, 2.5)$. The intersection of this interval with $S_E = [0, 1] \\cup \\{2\\}$ is just $\\{2\\}$. Therefore, $2$ is an isolated point.\nThe set $S_E$ is infinite and has exactly one isolated point.
