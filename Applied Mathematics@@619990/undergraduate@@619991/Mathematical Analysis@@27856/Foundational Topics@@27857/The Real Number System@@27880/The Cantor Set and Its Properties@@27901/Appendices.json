Let's denote this sum by $S_p$. To find $S_p$, we sum the contributions from each step $k$, from $k=1$ to infinity. The contribution at step $k$ is the number of intervals removed at that step multiplied by the $p$-th power of the length of each of those intervals.\n\nContribution at step $k = N_k \\cdot (L_k)^p = 2^{k-1} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{3^k}\\right)^p = \\frac{2^{k-1}}{3^{kp}}$.\n\nThe total sum $S_p$ is the infinite series:\n$$S_p = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^{k-1}}{3^{kp}}$$\n\nWe can rewrite this expression to identify it as a geometric series.\n$$S_p = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2^k}{3^{kp}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^k}{(3^p)^k} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{2}{3^p}\\right)^k$$\n\nThis is a geometric series of the form $\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} ar^{k-1} = a + ar + ar^2 + \\dots$, where the first term is $a' = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{2}{3^p}\\right)^1 = \\frac{1}{3^p}$ and the common ratio is $r = \\frac{2}{3^p}$.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series $\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} x^k$ is given by $\\frac{x}{1-x}$, provided that $|x| < 1$. In our case, the sum inside the parenthesis is a geometric series with ratio $r = \\frac{2}{3^p}$. Let's verify the condition for convergence. Since $p \\geq 1$, we have $3^p \\geq 3^1 = 3$. Therefore, the common ratio $r = \\frac{2}{3^p}$ satisfies $0 < r \\leq \\frac{2}{3}$. Since $|r| < 1$, the series converges.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of a geometric series starting from $k=1$, $\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} r^k = \\frac{r}{1-r}$:\n$$S_p = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\frac{2}{3^p}}{1 - \\frac{2}{3^p}} \\right)$$\n\nNow, we simplify the expression:\n$$S_p = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\frac{2}{3^p}}{\\frac{3^p - 2}{3^p}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2}{3^p} \\cdot \\frac{3^p}{3^p - 2} \\right)$$\n$$S_p = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2}{3^p - 2} \\right)$$\n$$S_p = \\frac{1}{3^p - 2}$$\n\nThis is the value of the series for any $p$ such that the series converges.
