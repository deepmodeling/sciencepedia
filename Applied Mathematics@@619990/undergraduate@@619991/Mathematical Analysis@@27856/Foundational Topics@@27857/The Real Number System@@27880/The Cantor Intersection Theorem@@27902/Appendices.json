The sequence is defined recursively. The initial set is the closed square $K_0 = [-1, 1] \\times [-1, 1]$. Subsequent sets are generated by applying an affine transformation $T: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ to the preceding set. Specifically, $K_{n+1} = T(K_n)$, where the transformation $T$ is given by\n$$\nT(x,y) = \\left(\\frac{x}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{y}{2}-\\frac{1}{4}\\right).\n$$\nThis construction generates a nested sequence of non-empty compact sets, i.e., $K_0 \\supset K_1 \\supset K_2 \\supset \\cdots$. According to the Cantor intersection theorem, the intersection of such a sequence is non-empty. Furthermore, because the transformation $T$ is a contraction mapping, the diameter of the sets $K_n$ tends to zero, which guarantees that the intersection consists of a single, unique point.\n\nLet this unique point be $P = (x^*, y^*)$.

If $P$ is the unique point in the intersection, then $P \\in K = \\bigcap_{n=0}^{\\infty} K_n$.\nThe set $K$ itself is mapped into itself by $T$.
