The critical points where the expressions change sign are obtained from $3x - 6 = 0$ and $x + 2 = 0$, which give $x = 2$ and $x = -2$. Thus, consider the intervals $(-\\infty, -2)$, $[-2, 2)$, and $[2, \\infty)$.\n\nRecall the definition of absolute value: for any real $a$, $|a| = a$ if $a \\ge 0$ and $|a| = -a$ if $a < 0$.\n\nCase 1: $x < -2$. Then $3x - 6 < 0$ and $x + 2 < 0$, so $|3x - 6| = 6 - 3x$ and $|x + 2| = -x - 2$.

The quantities are given by the products $E_1 = ac$ and $E_2 = bd$. While the exact values of the parameters are unknown, they are constrained by the results of other measurements. These constraints on the real-valued parameters $a, b, c, d$ are given as:\n\n1.  $|a-b| \\le 0.05$\n2.  $|c-d| \\le 0.02$\n3.  $|a| \\le 10$\n4.  $|d| \\le 20$\n\nGiven these constraints, determine the maximum possible value of the magnitude of the difference between the two quantities, $|E_1 - E_2|$. Your final answer should be a single real number.", "solution": "Our objective is to find the maximum possible value of the expression $|ac - bd|$ given the constraints on the real numbers $a, b, c,$ and $d$.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to relate the expression $|ac - bd|$ to the given constraints, which involve $|a-b|$ and $|c-d|$. We can achieve this by adding and subtracting a carefully chosen term inside the absolute value. A suitable choice is the term $ad$ (or alternatively, $bc$).\n\nLet's start by manipulating the expression $|ac - bd|$:\n$$ |ac - bd| = |ac - ad + ad - bd| $$\n\nNow, we can factor the terms inside the absolute value by grouping them:\n$$ |ac - ad + ad - bd| = |a(c-d) + d(a-b)| $$\n\nAt this point, we can apply the triangle inequality, which states that for any two real numbers $x$ and $y$, we have $|x+y| \\le |x| + |y|$. Let's identify $x = a(c-d)$ and $y = d(a-b)$. Applying the triangle inequality gives us:\n$$ |a(c-d) + d(a-b)| \\le |a(c-d)| + |d(a-b)| $$\n\nNext, we use the property of absolute values that $|uv| = |u||v|$ for any real numbers $u$ and $v$. Applying this property to each term on the right-hand side, we get:\n$$ |a(c-d)| + |d(a-b)| = |a||c-d| + |d||a-b| $$\n\nCombining these steps, we have established an upper bound for our expression:\n$$ |ac - bd| \\le |a||c-d| + |d||a-b| $$\n\nNow we use the given constraints to find the maximum value of this upper bound. The constraints are:\n$|a| \\le 10$\n$|d| \\le 20$\n$|a-b| \\le 0.05$\n$|c-d| \\le 0.02$\n\nSince $|a|$ is at most $10$ and $|c-d|$ is at most $0.02$, the product $|a||c-d|$ is at most $10 \\times 0.02$.\nSimilarly, since $|d|$ is at most $20$ and $|a-b|$ is at most $0.05$, the product $|d||a-b|$ is at most $20 \\times 0.05$.\n\nSubstituting these maximum values into our inequality:\n$$ |ac - bd| \\le (10)(0.02) + (20)(0.05) $$\n$$ |ac - bd| \\le 0.2 + 1.0 $$\n$$ |ac - bd| \\le 1.2 $$\n\nThis shows that $1.2$ is an upper bound for $|ac - bd|$. To confirm that $1.2$ is the maximum possible value, we must show that it is achievable for some choice of $a, b, c, d$ that satisfy the given constraints.\n\nThe equality in the triangle inequality step, $|x+y| = |x|+|y|$, holds if and only if $x$ and $y$ have the same sign (or one or both are zero). In our case, this means we need $a(c-d)$ and $d(a-b)$ to have the same sign. We also need to choose the values of the parameters to be at the limits of their constraints to maximize the expression.\n\nLet's try to achieve the value $1.2$. We can set:\n-   $a = 10$ (to satisfy $|a| \\le 10$ and make $|a|$ as large as possible)\n-   $d = 20$ (to satisfy $|d| \\le 20$ and make $|d|$ as large as possible)\n\nWith these choices, we then choose $b$ and $c$ to maximize the differences:\n-   To make $|a-b|=0.05$, with $a=10$, we can choose $b = 9.95$. Then $a-b = 0.05$.\n-   To make $|c-d|=0.02$, with $d=20$, we can choose $c = 20.02$. Then $c-d = 0.02$.\n\nLet's check if our chosen values satisfy all constraints:\n1.  $|a-b| = |10 - 9.95| = 0.05 \\le 0.05$ (Satisfied)\n2.  $|c-d| = |20.02 - 20| = 0.02 \\le 0.02$ (Satisfied)\n3.  $|a| = |10| = 10 \\le 10$ (Satisfied)\n4.  $|d| = |20| = 20 \\le 20$ (Satisfied)\n\nNow we check the signs of the terms for the triangle inequality:\n-   $a(c-d) = 10(0.02) = 0.2$ (Positive)\n-   $d(a-b) = 20(0.05) = 1.0$ (Positive)\nSince both terms are positive, they have the same sign, and the equality in the triangle inequality will hold.\n\nFinally, we calculate $|ac - bd|$ for this set of values:\n$ac = 10 \\times 20.02 = 200.2$\n$bd = 9.95 \\times 20 = 199.0$\n$|ac - bd| = |200.2 - 199.0| = |1.2| = 1.2$\n\nSince we have found a set of parameters that satisfy the constraints and result in $|ac - bd| = 1.2$, we can conclude that the maximum possible value is indeed $1.2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.2}$$", "id": "1280872"}, {"introduction": "The power of a core principle like the triangle inequality is truly revealed when it is generalized to more abstract settings.
