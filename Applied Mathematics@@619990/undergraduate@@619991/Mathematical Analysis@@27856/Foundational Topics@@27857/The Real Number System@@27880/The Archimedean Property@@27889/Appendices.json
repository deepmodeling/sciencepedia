This principle asserts that between any two distinct real numbers, we can always find a rational number. This problem [@problem_id:24991] challenges you to not only find such a rational but to find the \"simplest\" one by minimizing its denominator, a task which requires both conceptual insight and elegant problem-solving.", "problem": "The Archimedean property of the real numbers states that for any two positive real numbers $x$ and $y$, there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $nx > y$. A direct consequence of this property is that the set of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$, is dense in the set of real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$. This means that for any two distinct real numbers $a$ and $b$, there always exists a rational number $r$ such that $a  r  b$.\n\nA rational number $r$ is a number that can be expressed as a fraction $p/q$ of two integers, a numerator $p$ and a non-zero denominator $q$. For this problem, we consider positive rational numbers, so $p$ and $q$ are positive integers.\n\nConsider the open interval $(\\sqrt{99}, 10)$. Your task is to find the rational number $r = p/q$ within this interval, where $p$ and $q$ are positive integers, that has the smallest possible denominator $q > 1$.", "solution": "Our goal is to find a rational number $r = \\frac{p}{q}$ with the smallest possible integer denominator $q > 1$ that satisfies the inequality:\n$$\n\\sqrt{99}  \\frac{p}{q}  10\n$$\nHere, $p$ and $q$ must be positive integers.\n\nWe can rewrite the inequality by multiplying all parts by the positive denominator $q$:\n$$\nq\\sqrt{99}  p  10q\n$$\nFor a given integer $q$, we need to determine if there exists an integer $p$ that lies strictly between $q\\sqrt{99}$ and $10q$. We are looking for the smallest integer $q > 1$ for which such an integer $p$ exists.\n\nLet's analyze the condition for the existence of such an integer $p$. An integer $p$ exists in the open interval $(q\\sqrt{99}, 10q)$ if and only if this interval is not entirely contained between two consecutive integers. We can systematically check values of $q$ starting from $q=2$.\n\nFor an integer $p$ to exist, the integer $\\lfloor q\\sqrt{99} \\rfloor + 1$ must be less than $10q$.\nLet's analyze the inequality $10q - 1  q\\sqrt{99}$. If this inequality holds, then the interval $(q\\sqrt{99}, 10q)$ is a sub-interval of $(10q-1, 10q)$, which is an interval of length 1 between two consecutive integers. Such an interval cannot contain an integer.\n\nLet's test the condition $10q - 1  q\\sqrt{99}$. Since both sides are positive for $q \\ge 1$, we can square them without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$\n(10q - 1)^2  (q\\sqrt{99})^2\n$$\n$$\n100q^2 - 20q + 1  99q^2\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we get a quadratic inequality:\n$$\nq^2 - 20q + 1  0\n$$\nTo find for which values of $q$ this inequality holds, we first find the roots of the corresponding equation $q^2 - 20q + 1 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula, $q = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$\nq = \\frac{20 \\pm \\sqrt{(-20)^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2} = \\frac{20 \\pm \\sqrt{400 - 4}}{2} = \\frac{20 \\pm \\sqrt{396}}{2}\n$$\n$$\nq = \\frac{20 \\pm \\sqrt{36 \\cdot 11}}{2} = \\frac{20 \\pm 6\\sqrt{11}}{2} = 10 \\pm 3\\sqrt{11}\n$$\nTo approximate the roots, we know that $3^2=9$ and $3.5^2=12.25$, so $3  \\sqrt{11}  3.5$. Let's use $\\sqrt{11} \\approx 3.317$.\nThe roots are approximately:\n$q_1 = 10 - 3(3.317) = 10 - 9.951 = 0.049$\n$q_2 = 10 + 3(3.317) = 10 + 9.951 = 19.951$\n\nThe parabola $f(q) = q^2 - 20q + 1$ opens upwards, so the inequality $q^2 - 20q + 1  0$ holds for values of $q$ between the roots:\n$$\n10 - 3\\sqrt{11}  q  10 + 3\\sqrt{11}\n$$\nSince $q$ must be an integer, this inequality holds for $q \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 19\\}$. For all these values of $q$, we have $10q - 1  q\\sqrt{99}$, which implies that the interval $(q\\sqrt{99}, 10q)$ contains no integers. Therefore, no rational number $p/q$ can be found for $q = 2, 3, \\ldots, 19$.\n\nNow we must check the first integer value of $q$ for which the condition $q^2 - 20q + 1  0$ is not met. This is $q=20$.\nLet's test $q=20$:\nThe inequality for $p$ becomes:\n$$\n20\\sqrt{99}  p  200\n$$\nFor $q=20$, the quadratic $q^2-20q+1$ is $20^2 - 20(20) + 1 = 1 > 0$, so the inequality $10q-1  q\\sqrt{99}$ is false. Instead, we have $10q-1 \\ge q\\sqrt{99}$.\nLet's check this explicitly for $q=20$:\n$$\n10(20)-1 \\stackrel{?}{} 20\\sqrt{99}\n$$\n$$\n199 \\stackrel{?}{} 20\\sqrt{99}\n$$\nSquaring both sides:\n$$\n199^2 \\stackrel{?}{} (20\\sqrt{99})^2\n$$\n$$\n(200-1)^2 \\stackrel{?}{} 400 \\times 99\n$$\n$$\n40000 - 400 + 1 \\stackrel{?}{} 39600\n$$\n$$\n39601  39600\n$$\nThe inequality is true. This means that $199 > 20\\sqrt{99}$.\nSo, for $q=20$, the condition on $p$ is $20\\sqrt{99}  p  200$. Since we have just shown that $20\\sqrt{99}  199$, the integer $p=199$ satisfies this condition.\n$p=199$ lies in the interval $(20\\sqrt{99}, 200)$.\n\nThus, for $q=20$, we found an integer $p=199$. This gives the rational number $r = \\frac{199}{20}$.\nSince we have demonstrated that no solution exists for $q=2, 3, \\ldots, 19$, the smallest denominator $q>1$ is $q=20$.\n\nThe required rational number is $\\frac{199}{20}$.\nAs a check: $\\frac{199}{20} = 9.95$.\n$\\sqrt{99} \\approx 9.94987\\dots$\nSo, $9.94987\\dots  9.95  10$, which confirms our result.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{199}{20}}\n$$", "id": "24991"}]}
