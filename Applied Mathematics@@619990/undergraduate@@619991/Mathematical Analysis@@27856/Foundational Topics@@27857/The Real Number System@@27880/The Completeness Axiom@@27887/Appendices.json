Let $S$ be a non-empty subset of the real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nAn element $u \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is an **upper bound** of $S$ if $s \\le u$ for all $s \\in S$. A set is said to be **bounded above** if it has at least one upper bound.\n\nThe **supremum** of $S$, denoted $\\sup(S)$, is its least upper bound.

Thus $1$ is an upper bound of $S_A$. To show it is the least upper bound, let $\\varepsilon > 0$. There exists $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $2^{-n}  \\varepsilon$, which implies $1 - 2^{-n} > 1 - \\varepsilon$. Hence for every $\\varepsilon > 0$ there is an element of $S_A$ within $\\varepsilon$ of $1$ from below, so $\\sup(S_A) = 1$. No element of $S_A$ equals $1$, since $2^{-n} > 0$ for all $n$, so $S_A$ has no maximum. Therefore $S_A$ is bounded above, has a supremum, and does not have a maximum.\n\nFor $S_B = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid x^2 - x - 2 \\le 0\\}$, we factor $x^2 - x - 2 = (x - 2)(x + 1)$. The inequality $(x - 2)(x + 1) \\le 0$ holds exactly for $x \\in [-1, 2]$. Thus $S_B = [-1, 2]$, which is bounded above with $\\sup(S_B) = 2$, and $2 \\in S_B$, so $\\max(S_B) = 2$ exists. Hence $S_B$ does not meet the requirement.\n\nFor $S_C = \\{\\sin(\\pi/n) \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N}, n \\ge 2\\}$, note that for $n \\ge 2$, we have $\\pi/n \\in (0, \\pi/2]$ and the function $\\sin$ is strictly increasing on $[0, \\pi/2]$. As $n$ increases, $\\pi/n$ decreases, so the sequence $\\sin(\\pi/n)$ is strictly decreasing and its largest value occurs at $n=2$, giving $\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$. Therefore $\\sup(S_C) = 1$ and $\\max(S_C) = 1$ exists. Hence $S_C$ does not meet the requirement.\n\nFor $S_D = \\{n^2 - 10 \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$, the set is not bounded above because for any real number $u$, one can choose $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ with $n^2 > u + 10$, which yields $n^2 - 10 > u$. Hence it is not bounded above and therefore does not have a real supremum. It does not meet the requirement.\n\nFor $S_E = \\bigcap_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left[-1, 1 + \\frac{1}{k}\\right]$, note that the right endpoints $1 + \\frac{1}{k}$ decrease to $1$ as $k \\to \\infty$ and the left endpoint is fixed at $-1$. Any $x \\le 1$ lies in all intervals, while any $x > 1$ is excluded for all sufficiently large $k$ because $1 + \\frac{1}{k}  x$ eventually. Therefore $S_E = [-1, 1]$, which is bounded above with $\\sup(S_E) = 1$ and contains $1$, so $\\max(S_E) = 1$ exists.
