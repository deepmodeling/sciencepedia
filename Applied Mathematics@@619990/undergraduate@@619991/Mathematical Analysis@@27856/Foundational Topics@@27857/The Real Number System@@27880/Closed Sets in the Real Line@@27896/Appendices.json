Then $x = 2^k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. We need $y = -x = -2^k$ to be in $C$. However, the negative elements of $C$ are all of the form $-2^n - 2^{-n}$, which are not integers (and thus not of the form $-2^k$). So, $-2^k \\notin C$.\n- Case 2: Let $x$ be a negative element from $C$. Then $x = -2^k - 2^{-k}$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. We need $y = -x = 2^k + 2^{-k}$ to be in $C$. However, the positive elements of $C$ are all of the form $2^n$.
