Hence Statement 1 implies Statement 2.\n\nConversely, assume Statement 2: $xy\\ge 0$. Then $|x||y|=xy$. Compute\n$$\n(|x|+|y|)^{2}-|x+y|^{2}=(x^{2}+2|x||y|+y^{2})-(x^{2}+2xy+y^{2})=2(|x||y|-xy)=0.\n$$\nBoth $|x+y|$ and $|x|+|y|$ are nonnegative, so equality of squares implies\n$$\n|x+y|=|x|+|y|.\n$$\nThus Statement 2 implies Statement 1. Therefore, Statements 1 and 2 are equivalent.\n\nNext, relate Statement 3 to Statement 2.\n\nAssume Statement 3: there exists $c\\ge 0$ with either $x=cy$ or $y=cx$. If $x=cy$, then\n$$\nxy=c y^{2}\\ge 0.\n$$\nIf $y=cx$, then\n$$\nxy=c x^{2}\\ge 0.\n$$\nHence Statement 3 implies Statement 2.\n\nConversely, assume $xy\\ge 0$. If $y\\neq 0$, define $c=\\frac{x}{y}\\ge 0$, so $x=cy$. If $y=0$, choose $c=0$ and write $y=cx$. Thus Statement 2 implies Statement 3. Hence Statements 2 and 3 are equivalent.\n\nNow relate Statement 4 to Statement 2.\n\nAssume $xy\\ge 0$. Then $|x||y|=xy$. Square both sides of the desired equality and compare:\n$$\n|x-y|^{2}=x^{2}-2xy+y^{2},\\qquad ||x|-|y||^{2}=|x|^{2}-2|x||y|+|y|^{2}=x^{2}-2xy+y^{2}.\n$$\nTherefore $|x-y|^{2}=||x|-|y||^{2}$, and since both sides are nonnegative, it follows that\n$$\n|x-y|=||x|-|y||.\n$$\nThus Statement 2 implies Statement 4.\n\nConversely, assume $|x-y|=||x|-|y||$. Squaring both sides gives\n$$\nx^{2}-2xy+y^{2}=x^{2}-2|x||y|+y^{2}\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad xy=|x||y|\\ge 0.\n$$\nHence Statement 4 implies Statement 2. Therefore, Statements 2 and 4 are equivalent.\n\nFinally, relate Statement 5 to Statement 2.\n\nAssume $xy\\ge 0$. If $x\\ge 0$ and $y\\ge 0$, then $x|y|=xy=y|x|$. If $x\\le 0$ and $y\\le 0$, then $x|y|=x(-y)=-xy=y(-x)=y|x|$. If one of $x$ or $y$ is zero, both sides are zero. Thus Statement 2 implies Statement 5.\n\nConversely, assume $x|y|=y|x|$. If $|x||y|=0$, then $xy=0\\ge 0$. If $|x||y|0$, divide both sides by $|x||y|$ to get\n$$\n\\frac{x}{|x|}=\\frac{y}{|y|},\n$$\nwhich for real nonzero numbers forces $x$ and $y$ to have the same sign, hence $xy\\ge 0$. Therefore, Statement 5 implies Statement 2. Thus Statements 2 and 5 are equivalent.\n\nCollecting the results, Statements 2, 3, 4, and 5 are each equivalent to Statement 1.
