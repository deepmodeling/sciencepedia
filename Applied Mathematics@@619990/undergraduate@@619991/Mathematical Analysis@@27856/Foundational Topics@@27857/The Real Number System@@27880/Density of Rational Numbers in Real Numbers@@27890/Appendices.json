We will first determine the infima and suprema of the sets $A$ and $B$ and then use standard properties of infimum and supremum for set addition and subtraction.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the set $A = \\{q \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\mid \\sqrt{3} < q < \\sqrt{5}\\}$.\nThe infimum of $A$, denoted $\\inf(A)$, is the greatest lower bound of $A$. By the definition of set $A$, every element $q \\in A$ satisfies $q > \\sqrt{3}$. Thus, $\\sqrt{3}$ is a lower bound for $A$. To show it is the greatest lower bound, we must show that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an element $q \\in A$ such that $q < \\sqrt{3} + \\epsilon$. By the density of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ in the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$, for any two distinct real numbers $x < y$, there exists a rational number $q$ such that $x < q < y$. Let us choose $x = \\sqrt{3}$ and $y = \\min(\\sqrt{3}+\\epsilon, \\sqrt{5})$. Since $\\sqrt{3} < \\sqrt{5}$, for a sufficiently small $\\epsilon$, $y > \\sqrt{3}$. Thus, there exists a rational $q$ such that $\\sqrt{3} < q < \\min(\\sqrt{3}+\\epsilon, \\sqrt{5})$. This $q$ is in $A$ and satisfies $q < \\sqrt{3}+\\epsilon$. This means no number greater than $\\sqrt{3}$ can be a lower bound for $A$. Therefore, $\\inf(A) = \\sqrt{3}$.\nSimilarly, every element $q \\in A$ satisfies $q < \\sqrt{5}$, so $\\sqrt{5}$ is an upper bound for $A$. To show it is the least upper bound (supremum), we use the density of $\\mathbb{Q}$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ again. For any $\\epsilon > 0$, we can find a rational number $q$ such that $\\max(\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{5}-\\epsilon) < q < \\sqrt{5}$. This $q$ belongs to $A$, which proves that no number smaller than $\\sqrt{5}$ can be an upper bound. Hence, $\\sup(A) = \\sqrt{5}$.\n\nUsing the same reasoning for the set $B = \\{r \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\mid \\sqrt{7} < r < \\sqrt{11}\\}$, we find:\n$\\inf(B) = \\sqrt{7}$\n$\\sup(B) = \\sqrt{11}$\n\nNext, we need to find the supremum of the sum set $S=A+B$. The general property for the supremum of a sum of two non-empty sets $A, B \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ is $\\sup(A+B) = \\sup(A) + \\sup(B)$.\nLet's verify this. Let $s_A = \\sup(A)$ and $s_B = \\sup(B)$. For any $a \\in A$ and $b \\in B$, we have $a \\le s_A$ and $b \\le s_B$. Thus, $a+b \\le s_A+s_B$. This shows that $s_A+s_B$ is an upper bound for $A+B$.\nTo show it is the least upper bound, let $\\epsilon > 0$. By the definition of supremum, there exists $a' \\in A$ such that $a' > s_A - \\epsilon/2$ and there exists $b' \\in B$ such that $b' > s_B - \\epsilon/2$. The element $a'+b'$ is in $A+B$. We have $a'+b' > (s_A - \\epsilon/2) + (s_B - \\epsilon/2) = s_A+s_B - \\epsilon$. Since for any $\\epsilon > 0$ we can find an element in $A+B$ greater than $(s_A+s_B)-\\epsilon$, no number smaller than $s_A+s_B$ can be an upper bound. Thus, $\\sup(A+B) = s_A+s_B$.\nApplying this to our sets:\n$\\sup(S) = \\sup(A+B) = \\sup(A) + \\sup(B) = \\sqrt{5} + \\sqrt{11}$.\n\nFinally, we need to find the infimum of the difference set $D=A-B$. The set is defined as $D = \\{a-b \\mid a \\in A, b \\in B\\}$. This can be written as $D = A + (-B)$, where $-B = \\{-b \\mid b \\in B\\}$. First, we find the infimum and supremum of $-B$.\nIf $\\sqrt{7} < b < \\sqrt{11}$, then $-\\sqrt{11} < -b < -\\sqrt{7}$.\nSo, $-B = \\{s \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\mid -\\sqrt{11} < s < -\\sqrt{7}\\}$.\nThus, $\\inf(-B) = -\\sqrt{11}$ and $\\sup(-B) = -\\sqrt{7}$. Notice that $\\inf(-B) = -\\sup(B)$ and $\\sup(-B) = -\\inf(B)$.\nThe general property for the infimum of a sum is $\\inf(A+C) = \\inf(A) + \\inf(C)$. Applying this to $D = A + (-B)$:\n$\\inf(D) = \\inf(A+(-B)) = \\inf(A) + \\inf(-B) = \\inf(A) - \\sup(B)$.\nLet's verify this rule: $\\inf(A-B) = \\inf(A) - \\sup(B)$.\nLet $i_A = \\inf(A)$ and $s_B = \\sup(B)$. For any $a \\in A$ and $b \\in B$, we have $a \\ge i_A$ and $b \\le s_B$, which implies $-b \\ge -s_B$. So, $a-b = a+(-b) \\ge i_A - s_B$. This shows $i_A - s_B$ is a lower bound for $A-B$.\nTo show it is the greatest lower bound, let $\\epsilon > 0$. There exists $a' \\in A$ such that $a' < i_A + \\epsilon/2$ and there exists $b' \\in B$ such that $b' > s_B - \\epsilon/2$. Then $a'-b'$ is in $A-B$, and $a'-b' < (i_A + \\epsilon/2) - (s_B - \\epsilon/2) = i_A - s_B + \\epsilon$. This shows that no number greater than $i_A - s_B$ can be a lower bound. Therefore, $\\inf(A-B) = i_A - s_B$.\nApplying this to our sets:\n$\\inf(D) = \\inf(A-B) = \\inf(A) - \\sup(B) = \\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{11}$.\n\nThe two required values are $\\inf(D) = \\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{11}$ and $\\sup(S) = \\sqrt{5} + \\sqrt{11}$.\nThe question asks for the answer as a row matrix $[\\inf(D), \\sup(S)]$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{11} & \\sqrt{5} + \\sqrt{11} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2296770"}]}
