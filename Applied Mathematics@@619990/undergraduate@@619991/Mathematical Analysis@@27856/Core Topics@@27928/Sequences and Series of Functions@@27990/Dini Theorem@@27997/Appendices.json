In the context of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$, a set is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded (Heine-Borel theorem). The interval $[0, 1]$ is both closed (it contains its endpoints 0 and 1) and bounded (it is contained within, for example, the interval $[-2, 2]$). Therefore, the domain $K = [0, 1]$ is a compact set. This hypothesis of Dini's theorem is satisfied. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n2.  **Continuity of the Functions $f_n$ (Option B):** For each positive integer $n$, the function $f_n(x) = x^n$ is a polynomial function.

For any non-negative value $f_n(x)$, multiplying by $x$ will result in a smaller or equal value.

We consider two cases for $x \\in [0, 1]$:\n    - Case 1: $x \\in [0, 1)$. For any $x$ in this range, the limit of the geometric sequence $x^n$ is 0. So, $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} x^n = 0$.\n    - Case 2: $x = 1$. The limit is $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} 1^n = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} 1 = 1$.\n    Since the limit exists for every $x \\in [0, 1]$, the sequence does converge pointwise.
