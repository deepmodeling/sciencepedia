The series of constants $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} M_n$ converges.\nThen, the series of functions $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} f_n(x)$ converges uniformly on $S$.\n\nLet's apply this test to our series, where $f_n(x) = \\frac{\\exp(-nx)}{\\sqrt{n^3+1}}$ and the set is $S = [0, \\infty)$.\n\nFirst, we need to find a suitable sequence $M_n$. We do this by finding the supremum of $|f_n(x)|$ over the interval $[0, \\infty)$.\nFor any $n \\geq 1$, the term $\\sqrt{n^3+1}$ is positive. Also, the exponential function $\\exp(-nx)$ is always positive for real arguments $-nx$.

The denominator $\\sqrt{n^3+1}$ is a constant with respect to $x$.\n\nThe function $g(x) = \\exp(-nx)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $x$ for $x \\geq 0$ (since $n \\geq 1$ is positive). Its derivative is $g'(x) = -n \\exp(-nx)$, which is negative for all $x$. Therefore, the maximum value of $\\exp(-nx)$ on the interval $[0, \\infty)$ occurs at the left endpoint, $x=0$.\nAt $x=0$, we have $\\exp(-n \\cdot 0) = \\exp(0) = 1$.\nThus, for any $x \\in [0, \\infty)$, we have $\\exp(-nx) \\leq 1$.\n\nThis allows us to bound $|f_n(x)|$:\n$$ |f_n(x)| = \\frac{\\exp(-nx)}{\\sqrt{n^3+1}} \\leq \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n^3+1}} $$\nThis inequality holds for all $x \\in [0, \\infty)$.
