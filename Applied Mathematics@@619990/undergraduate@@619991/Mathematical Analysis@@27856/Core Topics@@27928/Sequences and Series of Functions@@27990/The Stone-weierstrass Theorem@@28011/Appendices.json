This space is equipped with the uniform norm, defined by $\\|f\\|_{\\infty} = \\sup_{x \\in [-1, 1]} |f(x)|$.\n\nConsider the subalgebra $\\mathcal{A}$ of $C([-1, 1], \\mathbb{R})$ generated by the constant function $1$ and the function $g(x) = x^2$.

Any function $p \\in \\mathcal{A}$ has the form $p(x) = P(x^2)$ for some polynomial $P(y) = a_0 + a_1 y + \\dots + a_n y^n$. A crucial property of every function in $\\mathcal{A}$ is that it is an even function. An even function $h(x)$ is one that satisfies $h(-x) = h(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain. For any $p \\in \\mathcal{A}$, we have:\n$$p(-x) = P((-x)^2) = P(x^2) = p(x)$$\nSo, every function in $\\mathcal{A}$ is even.\n\nNext, we consider the property of uniform convergence. An important theorem in analysis states that the uniform limit of a sequence of continuous functions is continuous. More generally, properties that are \"stable\" under uniform limits are passed from the sequence to the limit function. The property of being an even function is one such stable property. If we have a sequence of even functions $(p_n)$ on $[-1, 1]$ such that $p_n \\to f$ uniformly, then the limit function $f$ must also be even. To see this, for any $x \\in [-1, 1]$:\n$$f(-x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} p_n(-x)$$\nSince each $p_n$ is even, $p_n(-x) = p_n(x)$. Therefore,\n$$f(-x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} p_n(x) = f(x)$$\nThis shows that $f$ must be an even function.\n\nCombining these two points, any function $f$ in the closure $\\overline{\\mathcal{A}}$ must be an even function. This allows us to immediately disqualify any functions from the given list that are not even. Let's check each option:\n\nA. $f_1(x) = |x|$. We check if it is even: $f_1(-x) = |-x| = |x| = f_1(x)$. This function is even. It remains a candidate.\n\nB. $f_2(x) = x^3$. We check if it is even: $f_2(-x) = (-x)^3 = -x^3 = -f_2(x)$. This function is odd, not even. Thus, it cannot be in $\\overline{\\mathcal{A}}$.\n\nC. $f_3(x) = \\cos(\\pi x)$. We check if it is even: $f_3(-x) = \\cos(-\\pi x) = \\cos(\\pi x) = f_3(x)$. This function is even. It remains a candidate.\n\nD. $f_4(x) = \\exp(x)$. We check if it is even: $f_4(-x) = \\exp(-x)$. For $x \\neq 0$, $\\exp(-x) \\neq \\exp(x)$. This function is not even. Thus, it cannot be in $\\overline{\\mathcal{A}}$.\n\nE. $f_5(x) = \\sin(\\pi x)$. We check if it is even: $f_5(-x) = \\sin(-\\pi x) = -\\sin(\\pi x) = -f_5(x)$. This function is odd, not even. Thus, it cannot be in $\\overline{\\mathcal{A}}$.\n\nSo far, we have eliminated options B, D, and E. We now need to determine if the candidate functions, $f_1(x) = |x|$ and $f_3(x) = \\cos(\\pi x)$, can indeed be uniformly approximated by functions in $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\nThis requires a version of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem. The standard theorem states that a subalgebra of $C(K, \\mathbb{R})$ (for a compact set $K$) is dense if it contains the constants and separates points. Our algebra $\\mathcal{A}$ fails to separate points on $[-1, 1]$ because for any $x_1 = -x_2 \\neq 0$, we have $p(x_1) = p(x_2)$ for all $p \\in \\mathcal{A}$. This is why $\\mathcal{A}$ is not dense in all of $C([-1, 1], \\mathbb{R})$.\n\nHowever, we can consider the space of continuous even functions on $[-1, 1]$, let's call it $C_{even}([-1, 1], \\mathbb{R})$. Any continuous even function $f(x)$ on $[-1, 1]$ is uniquely determined by its values on $[0,1]$. We can define a function $g(y)$ on the interval $[0,1]$ by setting $g(y) = f(\\sqrt{y})$. Since $f$ and $\\sqrt{y}$ are continuous, $g$ is a continuous function on $[0,1]$. So, $f(x) = g(x^2)$ for $x \\in [-1, 1]$.\n\nBy the Stone-Weierstrass theorem applied to the interval $[0,1]$, the algebra of polynomials in $y$ is dense in $C([0, 1], \\mathbb{R})$. This means that for our function $g(y)$, there exists a sequence of polynomials $(P_n(y))$ that converges uniformly to $g(y)$ on $[0,1]$.\n$$\\sup_{y \\in [0,1]} |g(y) - P_n(y)| \\to 0 \\quad \\text{as } n \\to \\infty$$\nNow, let's define a sequence of functions $p_n(x) = P_n(x^2)$. These functions belong to our algebra $\\mathcal{A}$. Let's check their convergence to $f(x)$ on $[-1, 1]$.\n$$\\|f - p_n\\|_{\\infty} = \\sup_{x \\in [-1,1]} |f(x) - p_n(x)| = \\sup_{x \\in [-1,1]} |g(x^2) - P_n(x^2)|$$\nAs $x$ ranges over $[-1, 1]$, the value of $x^2$ ranges over $[0, 1]$. Let $y = x^2$. Then the supremum above is equivalent to:\n$$\\sup_{y \\in [0,1]} |g(y) - P_n(y)|$$\nWe already know this term goes to zero. Therefore, the sequence $p_n(x) = P_n(x^2)$ converges uniformly to $f(x)$ on $[-1, 1]$.\n\nThis powerful result shows that any continuous even function on $[-1, 1]$ can be uniformly approximated by a polynomial in $x^2$. In other words, the closure of $\\mathcal{A}$ is precisely the set of all continuous even functions on $[-1, 1]$.\n\nReturning to our candidates:\n- $f_1(x) = |x|$ is a continuous even function on $[-1, 1]$. Therefore, it is in $\\overline{\\mathcal{A}}$.\n- $f_3(x) = \\cos(\\pi x)$ is a continuous even function on $[-1, 1]$. Therefore, it is in $\\overline{\\mathcal{A}}$.\n\nThus, the functions that belong to the closure of $\\mathcal{A}$ are $f_1(x)$ and $f_3(x)$.\nThe correct options are A and C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "1903162"}, {"introduction": "Building on the insights from the previous example, this problem [@problem_id:1903163] offers a fascinating contrast.
