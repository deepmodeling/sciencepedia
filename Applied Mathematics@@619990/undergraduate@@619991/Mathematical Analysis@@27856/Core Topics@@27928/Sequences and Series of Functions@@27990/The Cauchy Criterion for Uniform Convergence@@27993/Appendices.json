The failure of this condition often occurs at points where the functions change most rapidly. For our sequence, this happens for values of $x$ close to $0$.\n\nLet's try to find an $\\epsilon_0$ that violates the condition. A common strategy is to select specific values for $m$ and $n$ (for example, by setting $m=2n$) and then choosing a point $x$ that depends on $n$ in a way that prevents the difference from becoming arbitrarily small.\n\nLet's choose $m=2n$. We require $n > N$ for any given $N$. The difference becomes:\n$$ |f_{2n}(x) - f_n(x)| = \\frac{(2n-n)x}{(nx+1)(2nx+1)} = \\frac{nx}{(nx+1)(2nx+1)} $$\nNow, let's choose a point $x$ that depends on $n$. Let's pick $x = \\frac{1}{n}$.

This is the key to demonstrating the lack of uniform convergence.\n\nLet's set $\\epsilon_0 = 1/6$. Now we must show that for any integer $N>0$, we can find $m, n > N$ and an $x \\in (0,1)$ such that $|f_m(x) - f_n(x)| \\ge \\epsilon_0$.\nGiven any $N > 0$, let's choose $n = N+1$. This ensures $n > N$. We also require $n>1$ for our choice of $x=1/n$ to be in $(0,1)$, so let's refine our choice to $n = \\max(2, N+1)$. Now, let $m = 2n$. Then $m > n > N$. Finally, choose $x = 1/n$. Since $n \\ge 2$, $x = 1/n \\in (0,1]$. For $n>1$, $x \\in (0,1)$.\nWith these choices, we have just calculated that $|f_m(x) - f_n(x)| = |f_{2n}(1/n) - f_n(1/n)| = 1/6$.\nSo, we have shown that for $\\epsilon_0 = 1/6$, for any $N>0$, we can find $m,n>N$ and an $x \\in (0,1)$ such that the Cauchy condition is violated. Therefore, the sequence $(f_n)$ is not uniformly Cauchy on $(0,1)$.\n\nLet's review the options:\nA. This is incorrect. The problem occurs as $x \\to 0^+$, not as $x \\to 1$. Near $x=1$, the functions behave \"nicely\" and the difference $|f_n(1) - f_m(1)| = |\\frac{1}{n+1} - \\frac{1}{m+1}| \\to 0$ as $n,m \\to \\infty$.\nB. This statement confuses pointwise and uniform properties. For any fixed $x \\in (0,1)$, $f_n(x) \\to 0$, so the sequence of real numbers $\\{f_n(x)\\}$ converges and is thus a Cauchy sequence. This is the definition of being pointwise Cauchy, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for being uniformly Cauchy.\nC. This is exactly what we have demonstrated. We found that for $\\epsilon_0 = 1/6$, we can always find $m, n$ larger than any given $N$ and a point $x$ in the interval where the difference is at least $\\epsilon_0$. This statement correctly describes why the sequence is not uniformly Cauchy.\nD. While the pointwise limit is indeed $f(x)=0$, which is continuous, this does not guarantee uniform convergence. A famous theorem states that if a sequence of continuous functions converges uniformly, its limit must be continuous. The converse is not true.\nE. The behavior of the functions at $x=0$ is irrelevant to the question of uniform convergence on the open interval $(0,1)$, which explicitly excludes the point $x=0$.\n\nThus, statement C provides the correct reasoning.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1328544"}, {"introduction": "This final exercise explores the crucial role that the domain plays in determining uniform convergence.
