The limit of a geometric sequence $r^n$ as $n \\to \\infty$ is $0$ if $|r|1$.\nThus, for every $x \\in [0, \\frac{1}{2}]$, the limit is zero.\n$$\nf(x) = 0\n$$\nSo, the pointwise limit function on the interval $S$ is the zero function.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the expression for $M_n$**\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for $f_n(x)$ and $f(x)$ into the definition of $M_n$.\n$$\nM_n = \\sup_{x \\in [0, 1/2]} |f_n(x) - f(x)| = \\sup_{x \\in [0, 1/2]} |x^n - 0|\n$$\n$$\nM_n = \\sup_{x \\in [0, 1/2]} |x^n|\n$$\nSince $x$ is in the interval $[0, \\frac{1}{2}]$, $x$ is always non-negative. Therefore, $x^n$ is also non-negative, and the absolute value bars can be removed.\n$$\nM_n = \\sup_{x \\in [0, 1/2]} (x^n)\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the supremum for $M_n$**\n\nWe need to find the least upper bound (supremum) of the function $g(x) = x^n$ on the closed interval $[0, \\frac{1}{2}]$ for a fixed integer $n \\ge 1$.\nTo find the maximum value of $g(x)$, we can analyze its derivative with respect to $x$:\n$$\ng'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = n x^{n-1}\n$$\nFor any $x \\in (0, \\frac{1}{2}]$, we have $x  0$ and $n \\ge 1$, so $g'(x) = n x^{n-1}  0$. This indicates that the function $g(x) = x^n$ is strictly increasing on the interval $[0, \\frac{1}{2}]$.\nFor a continuous function that is strictly increasing on a closed interval $[a, b]$, its supremum (and maximum value) is attained at the right endpoint, $x=b$.\nIn our case, the supremum of $x^n$ on $[0, \\frac{1}{2}]$ occurs at $x=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n$$\nM_n = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n = \\frac{1}{2^n}\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final limit $L$**\n\nFinally, we compute the limit of $M_n$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n$$\nL = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} M_n = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{2^n}\n$$\nThis is the limit of a geometric sequence with ratio $r = \\frac{1}{2}$.

Thus, the expression inside the absolute value, $\\frac{\\lfloor nx \\rfloor}{n} - x$, is always less than or equal to zero. So we can write:\n$$ M_n = \\sup_{x \\in [0, 1]} \\left( x - \\frac{\\lfloor nx \\rfloor}{n} \\right) $$\nFrom the first step, we derived the inequality $x - \\frac{1}{n}  f_n(x) \\le x$.

To see this, consider a point $x_k = \\frac{k}{n} - \\epsilon$ for an integer $k \\in \\{1, ..., n\\}$ and a very small $\\epsilon > 0$. For such an $x_k$ close to, but less than, $k/n$, we have $\\lfloor nx_k \\rfloor = \\lfloor k - n\\epsilon \\rfloor = k-1$.\nThe difference is $|f_n(x_k) - x_k| = | \\frac{k-1}{n} - (\\frac{k}{n} - \\epsilon) | = |-\\frac{1}{n} + \\epsilon| = \\frac{1}{n} - \\epsilon$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, this difference approaches $\\frac{1}{n}$. This means the value $\\frac{1}{n}$ is the least upper bound (supremum) of the differences.\nTaking the limit as $n \\to \\infty$:\n$$ 0 \\le \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} M_n \\le \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} = 0 $$\nThis implies $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} M_n = 0$, which is the definition of uniform convergence.
