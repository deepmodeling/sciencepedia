The presence of the term $2n+1$ in the denominator suggests a connection to integration. We can establish this connection by starting with a known power series, specifically the geometric series, and integrating it term-by-term.\n\nConsider the geometric series formula:\n$$G(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x^n = \\frac{1}{1-x}$$\nThis series converges for $|x| < 1$.\n\nTo obtain a term like $(2n+1)$ in the denominator, we need to integrate a term of the form $t^{2n}$. Let's substitute $x = t^2$ into the geometric series formula:\n$$F(t) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (t^2)^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} t^{2n} = \\frac{1}{1-t^2}$$\nThis series converges for $|t^2| < 1$, which is equivalent to $|t| < 1$.\n\nNow, we can integrate the function $F(t)$ from $0$ to some value $x$ within the interval of convergence (i.e., $|x| < 1$). The theorem on term-by-term integration of power series allows us to interchange the integral and the summation:\n$$ \\int_0^x F(t) \\,dt = \\int_0^x \\left(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} t^{2n}\\right) dt = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\int_0^x t^{2n} \\,dt\\right) $$\nPerforming the integration on the term inside the sum gives:\n$$ \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left[ \\frac{t^{2n+1}}{2n+1} \\right]_0^x = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{x^{2n+1}}{2n+1} - 0 \\right) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{2n+1}}{2n+1} $$\nSo, we have derived the power series representation for the integral of $F(t)$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the integral of the closed-form expression for $F(t)$:\n$$ \\int_0^x \\frac{1}{1-t^2} \\,dt $$\nWe can use partial fraction decomposition for the integrand:\n$$ \\frac{1}{1-t^2} = \\frac{1}{(1-t)(1+t)} = \\frac{A}{1-t} + \\frac{B}{1+t} $$\nSolving for the coefficients $A$ and $B$, we find $1 = A(1+t) + B(1-t)$. Setting $t=1$ gives $1 = 2A$, so $A = \\frac{1}{2}$. Setting $t=-1$ gives $1 = 2B$, so $B = \\frac{1}{2}$.
