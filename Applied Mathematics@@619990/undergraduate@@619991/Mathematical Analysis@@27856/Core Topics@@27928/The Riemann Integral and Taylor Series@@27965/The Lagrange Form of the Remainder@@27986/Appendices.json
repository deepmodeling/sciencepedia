Express your answer as a single rational number in the form of a fraction.", "solution": "The problem asks for an upper bound on the error when approximating $\\sqrt[3]{28}$ using a first-degree Taylor polynomial for $f(x) = \\sqrt[3]{x}$.\n\nStep 1: Identify the function, the point of approximation, and the center of the Taylor expansion.\nThe function is $f(x) = x^{1/3}$.\nThe value we wish to approximate is $f(28)$, so $x=28$.\nThe center of the expansion, $a$, is the integer nearest to 28 that is a perfect cube. The perfect cubes near 28 are $3^3 = 27$ and $4^3 = 64$. Clearly, 27 is closer to 28. So, we choose $a=27$.\nThe degree of the Taylor polynomial is $n=1$.\n\nStep 2: State the Lagrange form of the remainder.\nThe error of the first-degree Taylor approximation is given by the remainder term $R_1(x)$. According to the Lagrange form of the remainder theorem, this is:\n$$R_n(x) = \\frac{f^{(n+1)}(\\xi)}{(n+1)!}(x-a)^{n+1}$$\nFor $n=1$, the remainder is:\n$$R_1(x) = \\frac{f''(\\xi)}{2!}(x-a)^2$$\nwhere $\\xi$ is some number between $a$ and $x$. In our case, $a=27$ and $x=28$, so $\\xi$ is in the interval $(27, 28)$. The magnitude of the error is $|R_1(28)|$.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the necessary derivatives of $f(x)$.\nWe need the second derivative, $f''(x)$.\nFirst derivative: $f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^{1/3}) = \\frac{1}{3}x^{-2/3}$.\nSecond derivative: $f''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}x^{-2/3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right)x^{-5/3} = -\\frac{2}{9}x^{-5/3}$.\n\nStep 4: Express the error term for our specific case.\nSubstituting the values $x=28$, $a=27$, and the second derivative into the remainder formula, we get:\n$$R_1(28) = \\frac{f''(\\xi)}{2!}(28-27)^2 = \\frac{f''(\\xi)}{2}(1)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}f''(\\xi)$$\nThe magnitude of the error is:\n$$|R_1(28)| = \\left| \\frac{1}{2} \\left(-\\frac{2}{9}\\xi^{-5/3}\\right) \\right| = \\left| -\\frac{1}{9}\\xi^{-5/3} \\right| = \\frac{1}{9\\xi^{5/3}}$$\nThis holds for some $\\xi \\in (27, 28)$.\n\nStep 5: Find an upper bound for the magnitude of the error.\nWe need to find the maximum possible value of the expression $\\frac{1}{9\\xi^{5/3}}$ for $\\xi \\in (27, 28)$.\nThe expression is a decreasing function of $\\xi$, because $\\xi$ is in the denominator with a positive exponent. Therefore, to maximize the value of the fraction, we must minimize the value of the denominator. This occurs when $\\xi$ is at its minimum possible value.\nSince $\\xi \\in (27, 28)$, we know that $\\xi  27$.\nThis implies:\n$$\\xi^{5/3}  27^{5/3}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{\\xi^{5/3}}  \\frac{1}{27^{5/3}}$$\nSo, the error magnitude is bounded above:\n$$|R_1(28)| = \\frac{1}{9\\xi^{5/3}}  \\frac{1}{9 \\cdot 27^{5/3}}$$\n\nStep 6: Calculate the numerical value of the upper bound.\nWe evaluate the bound:\n$$27^{5/3} = (27^{1/3})^5 = (3)^5 = 243$$\nSubstituting this into our inequality for the error bound:\n$$|R_1(28)|  \\frac{1}{9 \\cdot 243}$$\n$$|R_1(28)|  \\frac{1}{2187}$$\nThus, an upper bound for the magnitude of the error is $\\frac{1}{2187}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2187}}$$", "id": "2325404"}, {"introduction": "In many scientific and engineering contexts, we need to guarantee an approximation's accuracy not just at one point, but over an entire interval.
