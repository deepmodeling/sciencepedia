The term $\\sqrt{9x^2 - 5x + 1}$ involves a quadratic function inside the square root which is dominated by the $9x^2$ term for large negative values of $x$. So, $\\sqrt{9x^2 - 5x + 1} \\approx \\sqrt{9x^2} = |3x|$. Since $x \\to -\\infty$, $x$ is negative, which means $|x| = -x$. Therefore, $|3x| = -3x$.\nThe expression thus behaves like $-3x + 3x$, which is an indeterminate form of the type \"$\\infty - \\infty$\".\n\nTo resolve this indeterminate form, we can multiply the expression by its conjugate, which is $\\sqrt{9x^2 - 5x + 1} - 3x$, and divide by the same quantity. This is equivalent to multiplying by 1.\n$$ L = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} \\left( (\\sqrt{9x^2 - 5x + 1} + 3x) \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{9x^2 - 5x + 1} - 3x}{\\sqrt{9x^2 - 5x + 1} - 3x} \\right) $$\nUsing the difference of squares formula, $(a+b)(a-b) = a^2 - b^2$, on the numerator, we get:\n$$ L = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} \\frac{(\\sqrt{9x^2 - 5x + 1})^2 - (3x)^2}{\\sqrt{9x^2 - 5x + 1} - 3x} $$\nSimplifying the numerator:\n$$ L = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} \\frac{(9x^2 - 5x + 1) - 9x^2}{\\sqrt{9x^2 - 5x + 1} - 3x} = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} \\frac{-5x + 1}{\\sqrt{9x^2 - 5x + 1} - 3x} $$\nNow, we have an indeterminate form of the type \"$\\infty / \\infty$\".

Thus, if $V_{n} > V_{+}$, then $V_{n+1} < V_{n}$. Starting with $V_{0} = 5 > V_{+}$, the sequence is strictly decreasing while remaining above $V_{+}$ because $f$ is increasing on $(0, \\infty)$ and satisfies $f(V_{+}) = V_{+}$. Therefore $\\{V_{n}\\}$ is monotone decreasing and bounded below by $V_{+}$, hence convergent to some limit $L \\geq V_{+}$. Passing to the limit in $V_{n+1} = f(V_{n})$ yields $L = f(L)$, so $L$ must be a fixed point.
