Continuity of $f(x)$.\n2.  Differentiability of $f(x)$.\n3.  Continuity of the derivative $f'(x)$.\n\nWe will analyze these properties sequentially to find the smallest integer $k$ that satisfies the problem's criteria.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the continuity of $f(x)$ at $x=0$.\nFor $f(x)$ to be continuous at $x=0$, the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches 0 must equal $f(0)$.\nWe are given $f(0)=0$. We need to evaluate $\\lim_{x \\to 0} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0} x^k \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)$.\nThe sine function is bounded: $-1 \\le \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\le 1$ for all $x \\neq 0$.\nFor $x \\neq 0$, we can multiply this inequality by $|x|^k$, which is always non-negative:\n$$-|x|^k \\le |x|^k \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\le |x|^k$$\nNote that $x^k \\sin(1/x)$ is between $-|x|^k$ and $|x|^k$.\nWe evaluate the limits of the bounding functions: $\\lim_{x \\to 0} (-|x|^k) = 0$ and $\\lim_{x \\to 0} |x|^k = 0$, provided that $k0$.\nSince $k$ is a positive integer, $k \\ge 1$, so this condition holds.\nBy the Squeeze Theorem, $\\lim_{x \\to 0} x^k \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0$.\nSince $\\lim_{x \\to 0} f(x) = 0 = f(0)$, the function $f(x)$ is continuous at $x=0$ for all positive integers $k \\ge 1$.\n\nNext, we analyze the differentiability of $f(x)$ at $x=0$.\nFor $f(x)$ to be differentiable, the function must be continuous, which we've just shown it is for $k \\ge 1$. We must use the limit definition for the derivative at $x=0$:\n$$f'(0) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(0+h) - f(0)}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h^k \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{h}\\right) - 0}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} h^{k-1} \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{h}\\right)$$\nFor this limit to exist, we can again use the Squeeze Theorem. The limit will be 0 if the exponent of $h$ is strictly greater than 0.\nWe require $k-1  0$, which implies $k  1$.\nSince $k$ is an integer, the function is differentiable at $x=0$ if $k \\ge 2$. For these values, $f'(0)=0$.\nIf $k=1$, the limit becomes $\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\sin(1/h)$, which does not exist.\nSo, for $f(x)$ to be differentiable everywhere (it is clearly differentiable for $x \\neq 0$ as a composition of differentiable functions), we must have $k \\ge 2$.\n\nFinally, we analyze the continuity of the derivative, $f'(x)$, at $x=0$.\nFirst, let's find the derivative for $x \\neq 0$ using the product and chain rules:\n$$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(x^k \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\right) = kx^{k-1}\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) + x^k \\cos\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{x^2}\\right)$$\n$$f'(x) = kx^{k-1}\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) - x^{k-2}\\cos\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)$$\nFor $f'(x)$ to be continuous at $x=0$, we must have $\\lim_{x \\to 0} f'(x) = f'(0)$.\nFrom the previous step, we know that for the function to be differentiable, we need $k \\ge 2$, and in these cases, $f'(0)=0$.\nSo, we need to check when $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\left( kx^{k-1}\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) - x^{k-2}\\cos\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\right) = 0$.\nLet's analyze the limit of each term:\nThe first term is $\\lim_{x \\to 0} kx^{k-1}\\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)$. By the Squeeze Theorem, this limit is 0 if $k-1  0$, i.e., $k1$.\nThe second term is $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\left(-x^{k-2}\\cos\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\right)$. The existence of this limit depends on the exponent $k-2$.\n- If $k-2  0$ (i.e., $k2$), the limit is 0 by the Squeeze Theorem.\n- If $k-2 = 0$ (i.e., $k=2$), the term becomes $-\\cos\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)$, and $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\left(-\\cos\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\right)$ does not exist, as the function oscillates between -1 and 1.\n- If $k-2  0$ (i.e., $k2$), the limit diverges.\n\nFor the total limit $\\lim_{x \\to 0} f'(x)$ to be 0, the limits of both terms must be 0. This requires $k-10$ and $k-20$. The stricter condition is $k2$.\nThus, the derivative $f'(x)$ is continuous at $x=0$ if and only if $k  2$. Since $k$ is an integer, this means $k \\ge 3$.\n\nThe problem asks for the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $f(x)$ is differentiable everywhere, but $f'(x)$ is *not* continuous at $x=0$.\n- Differentiability everywhere requires $k \\ge 2$.\n- The derivative *not* being continuous at $x=0$ requires that the condition for continuity ($k \\ge 3$) is not met.\n\nCombining these, we need an integer $k$ such that $k \\ge 2$ and $k  3$.\nThe only integer that satisfies this is $k=2$.\n\nLet's verify our answer for $k=2$:\nThe function is $f(x) = x^2 \\sin(1/x)$ for $x \\neq 0$ and $f(0)=0$.\n- It is differentiable at $x=0$ with $f'(0) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} h \\sin(1/h) = 0$. It is differentiable everywhere.\n- The derivative is $f'(x) = 2x\\sin(1/x) - \\cos(1/x)$ for $x \\neq 0$.\n- The limit $\\lim_{x \\to 0} f'(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0} (2x\\sin(1/x) - \\cos(1/x))$. The first part $2x\\sin(1/x)$ goes to 0, but the second part $\\cos(1/x)$ oscillates and does not approach a limit.\n- Thus, $\\lim_{x \\to 0} f'(x)$ does not exist, so it cannot equal $f'(0)=0$. The derivative is not continuous at $x=0$.\n\nSo, $k=2$ satisfies all conditions and is the smallest such integer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2307240"}]}
