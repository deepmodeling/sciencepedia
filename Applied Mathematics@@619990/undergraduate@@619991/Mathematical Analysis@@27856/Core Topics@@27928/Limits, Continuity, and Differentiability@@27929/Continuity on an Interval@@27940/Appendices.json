Suppose, for contradiction, that no $c$ exists with $g(c) = 0$. Because $g$ is continuous on the connected interval $[0, L-d]$, the sign of $g$ must be constant, so either $g(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in [0, L-d]$ or $g(x) < 0$ for all $x \\in [0, L-d]$.\n- If $g(x) > 0$ on $[0, L-d]$, evaluate at $x_{k} = k d$ for $k = 0, 1, \\ldots, n-1$ (note $x_{k} \\in [0, L-d]$ since $x_{n-1} = L-d$).

It is continuous on the open interval $(0, 2)$.\n2. It is unbounded on the open interval $(0, 2)$.\n\nWe will analyze each option against these two conditions.\n\n**A. $f(x) = x^{2} - 2x + 5$**\nThis is a polynomial function. Polynomials are continuous for all real numbers. Therefore, $f(x)$ is continuous on the interval $(0, 2)$.\nTo check for boundedness on $(0, 2)$, we can consider the behavior of the function on the corresponding closed interval $[0, 2]$. Since the function is continuous on $[0, 2]$, by the Extreme Value Theorem, it must attain a maximum and minimum value on this closed interval, and thus it is bounded. The vertex of this parabola is at $x = -\\frac{-2}{2(1)} = 1$. The value at the vertex is $f(1) = 1^2 - 2(1) + 5 = 4$. At the endpoints, $f(0) = 5$ and $f(2) = 2^2 - 2(2) + 5 = 5$. For any $x \\in (0, 2)$, the function value $f(x)$ will be between $4$ and $5$. Thus, the function is bounded on $(0, 2)$. This option fails the second condition.\n\n**B. $f(x) = \\lfloor x \\rfloor$**\nThis is the floor function (or greatest integer function). A function is continuous on an open interval if it is continuous at every point in that interval. The floor function has jump discontinuities at every integer. Since the integer $1$ is in the interval $(0, 2)$, $f(x)$ is not continuous at $x=1$. For example, $\\lim_{x \\to 1^-} \\lfloor x \\rfloor = 0$ while $\\lim_{x \\to 1^+} \\lfloor x \\rfloor = 1$. Since the function is not continuous on $(0, 2)$, this option fails the first condition.\n\n**C. $f(x) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)$**\nThe function $g(x) = \\frac{1}{x}$ is continuous for all $x \\neq 0$. The sine function, $\\sin(u)$, is continuous for all real numbers $u$. The composition of continuous functions is continuous. Since for all $x \\in (0, 2)$, $x \\neq 0$, the function $f(x) = \\sin(\\frac{1}{x})$ is continuous on the interval $(0, 2)$.\nNow, we check for boundedness. The range of the sine function is $[-1, 1]$. This means that for any non-zero input, the output of the sine function is always between $-1$ and $1$, inclusive. Therefore, $|f(x)| = |\\sin(\\frac{1}{x})| \\le 1$ for all $x \\in (0, 2)$. The function is bounded. This option fails the second condition.\n\n**D. $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x-3}$**\nThis is a rational function. Rational functions are continuous everywhere except where their denominator is zero. The denominator is zero when $x-3=0$, which is at $x=3$. Since the point of discontinuity $x=3$ does not lie in the interval $(0, 2)$, the function $f(x)$ is continuous on $(0, 2)$.\nTo check for boundedness, we examine the function's values on the interval. As $x$ varies from $0$ to $2$, the denominator $x-3$ varies from $-3$ to $-1$. The function values $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x-3}$ therefore vary from $\\frac{1}{0-3} = -\\frac{1}{3}$ to $\\frac{1}{2-3} = -1$. The function values are always within the interval $[-1, -\\frac{1}{3}]$. Thus, the function is bounded on $(0, 2)$. This option fails the second condition.\n\n**E. $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x(2-x)}$**\nThis is a rational function. The function is discontinuous where the denominator is zero. The denominator $x(2-x) = 0$ for $x=0$ and $x=2$. Since neither of these points is in the open interval $(0, 2)$, the function is continuous on $(0, 2)$.\nNow we check for boundedness. Let's examine the behavior of the function as $x$ approaches the endpoints of the interval.\nConsider the limit as $x$ approaches $0$ from the right side (i.e., from within the interval):\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\frac{1}{x(2-x)} $$\nAs $x \\to 0^+$, $x$ is a small positive number and $(2-x)$ is close to $2$. Their product $x(2-x)$ is a small positive number. Therefore, the fraction approaches $+\\infty$.\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\frac{1}{x(2-x)} = +\\infty $$\nSince we can find values of $f(x)$ that are arbitrarily large by choosing $x$ sufficiently close to $0$, the function is not bounded on the interval $(0, 2)$.\nThis function is continuous on $(0, 2)$ and is unbounded on $(0, 2)$.
