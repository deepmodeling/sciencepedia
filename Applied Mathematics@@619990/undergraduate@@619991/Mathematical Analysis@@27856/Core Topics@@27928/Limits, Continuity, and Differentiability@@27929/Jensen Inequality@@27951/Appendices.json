This problem investigates a common scenario in systems engineering: comparing the expected time to complete a job with the time calculated from the expected processing rate.

This comparison can be made using Jensen's inequality.\n\nJensen's inequality relates the expected value of a function of a random variable to the function of the expected value of that random variable. For a convex function $f$, the inequality states $E[f(X)] \\ge f(E[X])$. For a strictly convex function and a non-constant random variable $X$, the inequality is strict: $E[f(X)] > f(E[X])$.\n\nIn this problem, the random variable is $R$, and the function being applied is $f(x) = 1/x$. The domain of our random variable $R$ consists of strictly positive values $\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n\\}$, so we consider the function $f(x) = 1/x$ for $x > 0$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the convexity of the function $f(x) = 1/x$ on its domain $x > 0$. We do this by examining its second derivative.\nThe first derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ is:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right) = -x^{-2} = -\\frac{1}{x^2} $$\nThe second derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ is:\n$$ f''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( -x^{-2} \\right) = -(-2)x^{-3} = \\frac{2}{x^3} $$\nSince the rates $r_i$ are all strictly positive, the domain of interest is $x > 0$. On this domain, $x^3 > 0$, and therefore the second derivative $f''(x) = 2/x^3$ is always positive. A positive second derivative over an interval indicates that the function is strictly convex on that interval.\n\nNow we apply Jensen's inequality for a strictly convex function. The problem states that $R$ is not a constant, meaning it takes at least two different values with non-zero probabilities. For a strictly convex function $f$ and a non-constant random variable $R$, Jensen's inequality is a strict inequality:\n$$ E[f(R)] > f(E[R]) $$\nSubstituting our function $f(x)=1/x$ and random variable $R$ into this inequality, we get:\n$$ E\\left[\\frac{1}{R}\\right] > \\frac{1}{E[R]} $$\nThe problem defines $T_{avg} = E[1/R]$ and $T_{at\\_avg\\_R} = 1/E[R]$. Substituting these definitions into our derived inequality gives:\n$$ T_{avg} > T_{at\\_avg\\_R} $$\nThis relationship holds true for any non-constant random variable $R$ that takes positive values, regardless of the specific values of the rates or their probabilities. Therefore, the relationship is general and does not depend on the specifics of the distribution (as long as it's not a constant).\n\nThis corresponds to choice C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2304615"}, {"introduction": "The power of convexity and Jensen's inequality extends into more abstract mathematical spaces, providing a unified way to understand seemingly disparate concepts.
