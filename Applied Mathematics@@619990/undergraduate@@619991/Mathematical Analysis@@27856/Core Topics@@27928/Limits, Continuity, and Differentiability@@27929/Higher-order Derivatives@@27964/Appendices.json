For a particle moving in a potential energy field $U(x)$, equilibrium points are found where the force, $-U'(x)$, is zero. This exercise challenges you to use both the first and second derivatives to map out a potential energy landscape: first by locating all equilibrium points, and then by using the sign of the second derivative to classify them as stable (local minima) or unstable (local maxima) [@problem_id:2300903].", "problem": "The potential energy $U(x)$ of a particle moving along the x-axis is described by the function:\n$$U(x) = \\frac{1}{4}x^4 - 2x^3 + 4x^2$$\nwhere $U$ is in nanojoules (nJ) and $x$ is in nanometers (nm).
