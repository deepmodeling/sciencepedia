For any $x$ in this interval, the value of $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is constant and equal to $\\lfloor c \\rfloor$.\nThus, within this interval, the function $h(x)$ is also constant:\n$$ h(x) = f(\\lfloor x \\rfloor) = f(\\lfloor c \\rfloor) $$\nThe limit of $h(x)$ as $x$ approaches $c$ is:\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to c} h(x) = \\lim_{x \\to c} f(\\lfloor c \\rfloor) = f(\\lfloor c \\rfloor) $$\nThe value of the function at $c$ is:\n$$ h(c) = f(\\lfloor c \\rfloor) $$\nSince $\\lim_{x \\to c} h(x) = h(c)$, the function $h(x)$ is continuous at every non-integer point $c$. This holds true for any continuous function $f(x)$, so the points of potential discontinuity are only the integers.\n\nNext, let's analyze the continuity at an integer point, $x=n$, where $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nFor $h(x)$ to be continuous at $x=n$, the limit as $x \\to n$ must exist and be equal to $h(n)$. This requires the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit to be equal to each other and to the function's value at that point.\n\nThe value of the function at $x=n$ is:\n$$ h(n) = f(\\lfloor n \\rfloor) = f(n) $$\n\nNow, let's evaluate the right-hand limit:\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to n^+} h(x) = \\lim_{x \\to n^+} f(\\lfloor x \\rfloor) $$\nFor $x$ in an interval $(n, n+\\delta)$ with $\\delta \\in (0, 1)$, we have $\\lfloor x \\rfloor = n$. Therefore:\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to n^+} h(x) = \\lim_{x \\to n^+} f(n) = f(n) $$\n\nNow, let's evaluate the left-hand limit:\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to n^-} h(x) = \\lim_{x \\to n^-} f(\\lfloor x \\rfloor) $$\nFor $x$ in an interval $(n-\\delta, n)$ with $\\delta \\in (0, 1)$, we have $\\lfloor x \\rfloor = n-1$. Therefore:\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to n^-} h(x) = \\lim_{x \\to n^-} f(n-1) = f(n-1) $$\nNote that since $f$ is continuous, the limit of $f$ applied to a value is simply $f$ of that value.\n\nFor continuity at $x=n$, we must have:\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to n^-} h(x) = \\lim_{x \\to n^+} h(x) = h(n) $$\nSubstituting our results, this gives the condition:\n$$ f(n-1) = f(n) $$\nFor $h(x)$ to be continuous for all real numbers, this condition must hold for all integer points $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe condition $f(n-1) = f(n)$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is equivalent to stating that $f(k) = f(k+1)$ for all integers $k$ (by setting $k = n-1$).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this derived condition.\nA. \"$f(x)$ must be a constant function.\" If $f(x)=C$, then $f(n)=C$ and $f(n+1)=C$ for all integers $n$. So this is a sufficient condition. However, it is not necessary. For example, if $f(x) = \\sin(\\pi x)$, then for any integer $n$, $f(n) = \\sin(n\\pi) = 0$ and $f(n+1) = \\sin((n+1)\\pi) = 0$. So $f(n)=f(n+1)$ is satisfied, but $f(x)$ is not a constant function. Thus, A is incorrect.\n\nB. \"$h(x)$ is continuous for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ if and only if $f(n) = f(n+1)$ for all integers $n$.\" This is precisely the condition we derived. It is both necessary and sufficient. Thus, B is correct.\n\nC. \"$h(x)$ is continuous ... if and only if $f(x)$ is a periodic function with period 1...\" This means $f(x) = f(x+1)$ for all *real numbers* $x$. This is a sufficient condition, as it implies $f(n)=f(n+1)$ for all integers $n$. However, it is not a necessary condition. The function $f(x) = \\sin(\\pi x)$ demonstrates this, as $f(x+1) = \\sin(\\pi(x+1)) = \\sin(\\pi x + \\pi) = -\\sin(\\pi x) \\neq f(x)$ in general, yet it yields a continuous $h(x)$. Thus, C is incorrect.\n\nD. \"$h(x)$ is never continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$ unless $f(x)$ is a constant function.\" This is equivalent to saying that non-constant functions $f(x)$ cannot produce a continuous $h(x)$. This is false, as shown by the counterexample $f(x) = \\sin(\\pi x)$. Thus, D is incorrect.\n\nE. \"For any non-constant continuous function $f(x)$, ... $h(x)$ is ... discontinuous at all integer points.\" This is also false, again demonstrated by $f(x) = \\sin(\\pi x)$, which is non-constant but generates a continuous $h(x)$ (specifically, $h(x)=0$).
