The function's values at several points within this interval are given as:\n- $g(-2) = 3$\n- $g(0) = -1$\n- $g(1) = 2$\n- $g(3) = 0$\n\n**Background:**\nRecall the **Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)**: If a function $f$ is continuous on a closed interval $[a, b]$, and $N$ is any number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ (where $f(a) \\neq f(b)$), then there must exist at least one number $c$ in the open interval $(a, b)$ such that $f(c) = N$.\n\nA **root** of a function is a value $x=c$ in its domain such that the function evaluates to zero at that point, i.e., $f(c) = 0$.\n\nBased on the information provided, derive the minimum number of distinct roots that the function $g(x)$ is guaranteed to have in the interval $[-2, 3]$.", "solution": "## Derivation\n\nOur goal is to find the minimum number of guaranteed roots for the continuous function $g(x)$ on the interval $[-2, 3]$. A root occurs where $g(x) = 0$. We will use the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) to identify intervals where roots must exist.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the interval $[-2, 0]$**\n\nWe are given that the function $g(x)$ is continuous on $[-2, 3]$, which implies it is also continuous on the subinterval $[-2, 0]$. The values of the function at the endpoints of this subinterval are:\n- $g(-2) = 3$\n- $g(0) = -1$\n\nLet the target value be $N=0$. Since $g(0)  0  g(-2)$, we see that $N=0$ is between the values $g(-2)$ and $g(0)$. According to the IVT, there must exist at least one number $c_1$ in the open interval $(-2, 0)$ such that $g(c_1) = 0$. This confirms the existence of our first root.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the interval $[0, 1]$**\n\nThe function $g(x)$ is also continuous on the subinterval $[0, 1]$. The values of the function at these endpoints are:\n- $g(0) = -1$\n- $g(1) = 2$\n\nAgain, let the target value be $N=0$. Since $g(0)  0  g(1)$, the value $N=0$ is between $g(0)$ and $g(1)$. By the IVT, there must exist at least one number $c_2$ in the open interval $(0, 1)$ such that $g(c_2) = 0$. This confirms the existence of a second root.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the point $x=3$**\n\nWe are explicitly given the value of the function at $x=3$:\n- $g(3) = 0$\n\nBy the definition of a root, if $g(c)=0$, then $c$ is a root. Therefore, $x=3$ is a root of the function. Let's call this root $c_3=3$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the distinct roots**\n\nWe have guaranteed the existence of three roots:\n1.  $c_1 \\in (-2, 0)$\n2.  $c_2 \\in (0, 1)$\n3.  $c_3 = 3$\n\nTo determine the minimum number of roots, we must confirm that these three roots are distinct.\n- The root $c_1$ is strictly between $-2$ and $0$.\n- The root $c_2$ is strictly between $0$ and $1$.\n- The root $c_3$ is exactly $3$.\n\nSince the intervals $(-2, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, and the point $\\{3\\}$ are disjoint, the roots $c_1$, $c_2$, and $c_3$ must be distinct from one another.\n\nTherefore, the function $g(x)$ is guaranteed to have at least 3 distinct roots in the closed interval $[-2, 3]$. It is a minimum because the IVT only guarantees at least one root in each interval, and there could be more. However, based only on the given information, we can only be certain of these three.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "30174"}, {"introduction": "The power of the Intermediate Value Theorem is most evident when it is applied creatively to problems that are not obviously about root-finding.
