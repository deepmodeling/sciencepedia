The domain $[0, 1]$ is a closed and bounded interval, which means it is a compact set in $\\mathbb{R}$.\nThe Heine-Cantor theorem states that any continuous function defined on a compact set is uniformly continuous on that set.\nSince $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ is continuous on the compact set $[0, 1]$, it must be uniformly continuous on $[0, 1]$.\nTherefore, statement A is true.\n\n**Analysis of Statement B: Lipschitz Continuity on [0, 1]**\nStatement B claims that $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ is Lipschitz continuous on $[0, 1]$.\nFor $f(x)$ to be Lipschitz continuous on $[0, 1]$, there must exist a constant $L \\ge 0$ such that for all $x, y \\in [0, 1]$, $|f(x) - f(y)| \\le L|x-y|$.\nThis inequality can be rewritten as $\\frac{|f(x) - f(y)|}{|x-y|} \\le L$ for all $x \\neq y$ in $[0, 1]$. This means the \"secant slope\" must be bounded.\nLet's evaluate this ratio for our function $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$. For any two distinct points $x, y \\in [0, 1]$:\n$$\n\\frac{|\\sqrt{x} - \\sqrt{y}|}{|x-y|} = \\frac{|\\sqrt{x} - \\sqrt{y}|}{|(\\sqrt{x} - \\sqrt{y})(\\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{y})|} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{y}}\n$$\nFor the function to be Lipschitz continuous, this expression must be bounded for all $x, y \\in [0, 1]$.\nLet's consider the behavior as $x$ and $y$ approach $0$. Let's pick $y=0$ and let $x$ approach $0$ from the right ($x \\to 0^+$).\nThe ratio becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{|\\sqrt{x} - \\sqrt{0}|}{|x-0|} = \\frac{\\sqrt{x}}{x} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}\n$$\nAs $x \\to 0^+$, the value of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}$ approaches infinity.\n$$\n\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}} = \\infty\n$$\nSince the ratio $\\frac{|f(x) - f(y)|}{|x-y|}$ is not bounded on $[0, 1]$, there is no finite constant $L$ that can satisfy the Lipschitz condition for all $x, y$ in the interval.\nTherefore, $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ is not Lipschitz continuous on $[0, 1]$. Statement B is false.\n\n**Analysis of Statement C: Differentiability and Bounded Derivative**\nStatement C claims that $f(x)$ is differentiable on $(0, 1)$ and its derivative is bounded on $(0, 1)$.\nLet's find the derivative of $f(x) = \\sqrt{x} = x^{1/2}$ for $x \\in (0, 1)$.\nUsing the power rule for differentiation:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} (x^{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} x^{-1/2} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x}}\n$$\nThe derivative exists for all $x \\in (0, 1)$, so the first part of the statement is true.\nNow we must check if the derivative $f'(x)$ is bounded on $(0, 1)$. We examine the limit of $f'(x)$ as $x$ approaches the endpoints of the interval. As $x \\to 1^-$, $f'(x) \\to \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{1}} = \\frac{1}{2}$. However, as $x \\to 0^+$, we have:\n$$\n\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f'(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x}} = \\infty\n$$\nSince the derivative is not bounded on the interval $(0, 1)$, the second part of the statement is false.\nTherefore, statement C is false.\n\n**Analysis of Statement D: Lipschitz Continuity on [α, 1]**\nStatement D claims that for any constant $\\alpha$ with $0 < \\alpha \\le 1$, the function $f(x)$ is Lipschitz continuous on the interval $[\\alpha, 1]$.\nWe again consider the ratio $\\frac{|f(x) - f(y)|}{|x-y|} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{y}}$ for $x, y \\in [\\alpha, 1]$ where $x \\neq y$.\nSince $x \\ge \\alpha$ and $y \\ge \\alpha$, we have $\\sqrt{x} \\ge \\sqrt{\\alpha}$ and $\\sqrt{y} \\ge \\sqrt{\\alpha}$.\nThis implies that their sum is bounded below:\n$$\n\\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{y} \\ge \\sqrt{\\alpha} + \\sqrt{\\alpha} = 2\\sqrt{\\alpha}\n$$\nTaking the reciprocal reverses the inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{y}} \\le \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\alpha}}\n$$\nSince $\\alpha > 0$, the quantity $L = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\alpha}}$ is a finite, positive constant.\nSo, for all $x, y \\in [\\alpha, 1]$, we have shown that $\\frac{|f(x) - f(y)|}{|x-y|} \\le L$. This is precisely the definition of Lipschitz continuity on the interval $[\\alpha, 1]$ with a Lipschitz constant of $L = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\alpha}}$.\nTherefore, statement D is true.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis of each statement:\n- Statement A is true.\n- Statement B is false.\n- Statement C is false.\n- Statement D is true.\n\nThe correct options are A and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "1308881"}]}
