This means there exists a real number $M_1$ such that for all $x  M_1$, we have $|f'(x) - 1|  \\frac{1}{2}$, which implies $f'(x)  \\frac{1}{2}$.\nFor any $x  M_1$, by the Mean Value Theorem on the interval $[M_1, x]$, there exists a $\\xi \\in (M_1, x)$ such that:\n$$ f(x) - f(M_1) = f'(\\xi)(x - M_1) $$\nSince $\\xi  M_1$, we have $f'(\\xi)  \\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, for $x  M_1$:\n$$ f(x) - f(M_1)  \\frac{1}{2}(x - M_1) \\implies f(x)  f(M_1) + \\frac{1}{2}(x - M_1) $$\nAs $x \\to \\infty$, the right-hand side goes to $\\infty$, which implies $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = \\infty$.\n\nSimilarly, from the condition $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f'(x) = -1$, we can choose $\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{2}$. There exists a real number $M_2$ such that for all $x  M_2$, we have $|f'(x) - (-1)|  \\frac{1}{2}$, which implies $f'(x)  -\\frac{1}{2}$.\nFor any $x  M_2$, by the Mean Value Theorem on the interval $[x, M_2]$, there exists a $\\zeta \\in (x, M_2)$ such that:\n$$ f(M_2) - f(x) = f'(\\zeta)(M_2 - x) $$\nSince $\\zeta  M_2$, we have $f'(\\zeta)  -\\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, for $x  M_2$:\n$$ f(M_2) - f(x)  -\\frac{1}{2}(M_2 - x) \\implies f(x)  f(M_2) + \\frac{1}{2}(M_2 - x) $$\nAs $x \\to -\\infty$, the term $(M_2 - x)$ goes to $\\infty$, so the right-hand side goes to $\\infty$. This implies $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = \\infty$.\n\nSince $f$ is differentiable on $\\mathbb{R}$, it is also continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$. We have a continuous function $f(x)$ such that $\\lim_{x \\to \\pm\\infty} f(x) = \\infty$. This guarantees that $f$ is bounded below and must attain its global minimum. To show this formally, pick any point, say $x=0$. Since $\\lim_{x \\to \\pm\\infty} f(x) = \\infty$, there exists $R0$ such that for all $|x|  R$, $f(x)  f(0)$. On the compact interval $[-R, R]$, the continuous function $f$ must attain a minimum value, say at $x_0 \\in [-R, R]$. So, $f(x_0) \\le f(x)$ for all $x \\in [-R, R]$. In particular, $f(x_0) \\le f(0)$. For any $x$ outside this interval, i.e., $|x|R$, we have $f(x)  f(0) \\ge f(x_0)$. Thus, $f(x_0)$ is the global minimum of $f$.\n\n**Statement B: There exists at least one real number $c$ such that $f'(c) = 0$.**\n\nThis statement is **true**.\nFrom $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f'(x) = 1$, we can choose a real number $b$ large enough such that $f'(b)  0$. For instance, for $\\epsilon = 0.5$, there is $M_1$ such that for $xM_1$, $f'(x)0.5$. Pick $b=M_1+1$.\nFrom $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f'(x) = -1$, we can choose a real number $a$ small enough (large in magnitude and negative) such that $f'(a)  0$. For instance, for $\\epsilon = 0.5$, there is $M_2$ such that for $xM_2$, $f'(x)-0.5$. Pick $a=M_2-1$.\nWe have two points $a$ and $b$ with $a  b$ such that $f'(a)  0$ and $f'(b)  0$. The number $k=0$ is between $f'(a)$ and $f'(b)$.\nSince $f$ is differentiable on $\\mathbb{R}$, its derivative $f'$ has the intermediate value property (this is Darboux's Theorem). Therefore, there must exist at least one point $c$ in the interval $(a, b)$ such that $f'(c) = k = 0$.\n\n**Statement C: The derivative function $f'(x)$ must be continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$.**\n\nThis statement is **false**.\nA function being a derivative does not guarantee its continuity. While derivatives possess the intermediate value property (Darboux's Theorem), they are not necessarily continuous. A standard counterexample is the function $g(x) = x^2 \\sin(1/x)$ for $x \\neq 0$ and $g(0) = 0$. Its derivative is $g'(x) = 2x \\sin(1/x) - \\cos(1/x)$ for $x \\neq 0$, and $g'(0)=0$. As $x \\to 0$, $g'(x)$ does not have a limit due to the $\\cos(1/x)$ term, so $g'$ is discontinuous at $x=0$.\nWhile this specific example does not satisfy the limit conditions $\\lim_{x \\to \\pm\\infty} f'(x) = \\pm 1$, it demonstrates that a function can be differentiable everywhere without its derivative being continuous. It is possible to construct more complex functions that satisfy all the conditions of the problem while having a discontinuous derivative. Thus, continuity of $f'$ is not a necessary consequence.\n\n**Statement D: The equation $f(x) = 0$ must have at least one real solution.**\n\nThis statement is **false**.\nWe can find a function that satisfies the given derivative properties but is always positive. Consider the function $f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2 + 1}$.\nThis function is differentiable everywhere. Its derivative is:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x^2+1}} (2x) = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2+1}} $$\nLet's check the limits:\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f'(x) = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{x}{x\\sqrt{1+1/x^2}} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+1/x^2}} = 1 $$\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f'(x) = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} \\frac{x}{|x|\\sqrt{1+1/x^2}} = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} \\frac{x}{-x\\sqrt{1+1/x^2}} = -1 $$\nThe conditions on the derivative are met. However, for any real $x$, $x^2 \\ge 0$, so $x^2+1 \\ge 1$. This means $f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2+1} \\ge 1$. The function never takes the value 0. Therefore, the equation $f(x)=0$ has no solution.\n\n**Statement E: The function $f(x)$ is monotonic on some interval of the form $(-\\infty, a)$ and also on some interval of the form $(b, \\infty)$ for some real numbers $a$ and $b$.**\n\nThis statement is **true**.\nThis follows directly from the definition of the limits of $f'(x)$.\nConsider $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f'(x) = 1$. By definition, for $\\epsilon = 0.5$, there exists a real number $b$ such that for all $x  b$, we have $|f'(x) - 1|  0.5$. This inequality implies $0.5  f'(x)  1.5$. Since $f'(x)  0$ for all $x \\in (b, \\infty)$, the function $f(x)$ is strictly increasing, and therefore monotonic, on the interval $(b, \\infty)$.\nConsider $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f'(x) = -1$. By definition, for $\\epsilon = 0.5$, there exists a real number $a$ such that for all $x  a$, we have $|f'(x) - (-1)|  0.5$. This inequality implies $-1.5  f'(x)  -0.5$. Since $f'(x)  0$ for all $x \\in (-\\infty, a)$, the function $f(x)$ is strictly decreasing, and therefore monotonic, on the interval $(-\\infty, a)$.\n\nIn summary, statements A, B, and E are necessarily true, while C and D are false.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABE}$$", "id": "2324915"}, {"introduction": "This problem bridges two cornerstone theorems of calculus: the Mean Value Theorem and Darboux's Theorem.

Darboux's Theorem states that if a function $f$ is differentiable on an interval $[a, b]$, then its derivative $f'(x)$ takes on every value between $f'(a)$ and $f'(b)$. A crucial point is that the derivative $f'(x)$ need not be continuous for this property to hold. The existence of the derivative everywhere on the interval is sufficient.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n1.  $f$ is differentiable on $[-1, 1]$. This implies that Darboux's Theorem can be applied to $f'$ on any subinterval of $[-1, 1]$.\n2.  $f'(-1) = 0$.\n3.  $f'(1) = 0$.\n4.

Since $K  0$, we have $0  K/3  K$.\n\nLet's consider two distinct intervals: $[-1, x_0]$ and $[x_0, 1]$.\n\n**Interval 1: $[-1, x_0]$**\nThe function $f$ is differentiable on this interval. The values of its derivative at the endpoints are:\n- $f'(-1) = 0$\n- $f'(x_0) = K$\n\nThe target value is $V = K/3$. Since $0  K/3  K$, the value $V$ lies strictly between $f'(-1)$ and $f'(x_0)$.\nBy Darboux's Theorem applied to the interval $[-1, x_0]$, there must exist at least one point $c_1$ in the open interval $(-1, x_0)$ such that $f'(c_1) = K/3$.\n\n**Interval 2: $[x_0, 1]$**\nSimilarly, the function $f$ is differentiable on this interval. The values of its derivative at the endpoints are:\n- $f'(x_0) = K$\n- $f'(1) = 0$\n\nThe target value is again $V = K/3$. Since $0  K/3  K$, the value $V$ lies strictly between $f'(1)$ and $f'(x_0)$.\nBy Darboux's Theorem applied to the interval $[x_0, 1]$, there must exist at least one point $c_2$ in the open interval $(x_0, 1)$ such that $f'(c_2) = K/3$.\n\nNow we need to check if these points are distinct.\nThe point $c_1$ is in the interval $(-1, x_0)$, which means $-1  c_1  x_0$.\nThe point $c_2$ is in the interval $(x_0, 1)$, which means $x_0  c_2  1$.\nFrom these two inequalities, it is clear that $c_1  x_0  c_2$, which implies $c_1 \\neq c_2$.\n\nTherefore, we have guaranteed the existence of at least two distinct points, $c_1$ and $c_2$, both within the larger interval $(-1, 1)$, where the derivative is equal to $K/3$.\n\nThe question asks for the minimum guaranteed number. We have shown that at least two such points are guaranteed to exist. We cannot guarantee more than two, as a simple quadratic function appropriately shifted and scaled could have exactly two such points. For example, the function $f(x) = -\\frac{3K}{4}x^2(x-2)$ on $[0,2]$ can be adapted to $[-1,1]$, but even without constructing an explicit example, our logical argument proves that two is the minimum number that *must* exist.\n\nThus, the minimum guaranteed number of points is 2.
