The key is to correctly interpret the absolute value term $|x-a|$ in each case.\n\nFirst, let's determine the left-hand limit, $L_{-} = \\lim_{x \\to a^{-}} f(x)$.\nWhen $x$ approaches $a$ from the left, it means that $x < a$. This implies that the term $x-a$ is negative.\nBy the definition of the absolute value function, if a quantity is negative, its absolute value is its negation. Thus, for $x < a$, we have $|x-a| = -(x-a)$.\nWe can now substitute this into the expression for $f(x)$:\n$$f(x) = \\frac{x^2 - a^2}{-(x-a)} \\quad \\text{for } x < a$$\nThe numerator is a difference of squares, which can be factored as $x^2 - a^2 = (x-a)(x+a)$.\nSubstituting the factored numerator, we get:\n$$f(x) = \\frac{(x-a)(x+a)}{-(x-a)}$$\nSince $x$ is approaching $a$ but is not equal to $a$, the term $x-a$ is non-zero, so we can cancel it from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$f(x) = -(x+a) \\quad \\text{for } x < a$$\nNow we can evaluate the limit by direct substitution:\n$$L_{-} = \\lim_{x \\to a^{-}} -(x+a) = -(a+a) = -2a$$\n\nNext, let's determine the right-hand limit, $L_{+} = \\lim_{x \\to a^{+}} f(x)$.\nWhen $x$ approaches $a$ from the right, it means that $x > a$. This implies that the term $x-a$ is positive.\nBy the definition of the absolute value function, if a quantity is positive, its absolute value is the quantity itself. Thus, for $x > a$, we have $|x-a| = x-a$.\nWe substitute this into the expression for $f(x)$:\n$$f(x) = \\frac{x^2 - a^2}{x-a} \\quad \\text{for } x > a$$\nAgain, we factor the numerator:\n$$f(x) = \\frac{(x-a)(x+a)}{x-a}$$\nAs before, since $x \\ne a$, we can cancel the $(x-a)$ term:\n$$f(x) = x+a \\quad \\text{for } x > a$$\nNow we can evaluate the limit by direct substitution:\n$$L_{+} = \\lim_{x \\to a^{+}} (x+a) = a+a = 2a$$\n\nThe left-hand limit is $L_{-} = -2a$ and the right-hand limit is $L_{+} = 2a$. Since $a$ is non-zero, $L_{-} \\ne L_{+}$. This indicates that the function has a jump discontinuity at $x=a$.\n\nThe final answer is required as a row matrix $[L_{-}, L_{+}]$.\nTherefore, the answer is $[-2a, 2a]$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{bmatrix} -2a & 2a \\end{bmatrix}}$$", "id": "1312445"}, {"introduction": "Transcendental functions, particularly the exponential function, often exhibit dramatic and asymmetric behavior around singularities.
