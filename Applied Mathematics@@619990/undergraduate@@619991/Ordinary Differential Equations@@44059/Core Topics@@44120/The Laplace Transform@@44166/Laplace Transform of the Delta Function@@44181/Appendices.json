By solving a first-order system subject to an impulse at the origin, you will practice the core mechanics of transforming the Dirac delta function, $\\delta(t)$. This problem specifically highlights the handling of initial conditions defined just before the impulse, at $t=0^-$, a crucial detail when dealing with discontinuities at the origin. [@problem_id:2182975]", "problem": "Consider a physical system whose state at time $t$ is described by the function $y(t)$. The evolution of the system's state for $t \\ge 0$ is governed by the following first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} + 2y(t) = 3\\delta(t)\n$$\nwhere $\\delta(t)$ is the Dirac delta function, representing a strong, instantaneous impulse applied at $t=0$. The system's state just before the impulse is applied is known to be $y = -1$. This is formally stated as the initial condition $\\lim_{t \\to 0^-} y(t) = -1$.\n\nDetermine the function $y(t)$ that describes the state of the system for all time $t > 0$.

We apply the Laplace transform to both sides of the given differential equation:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}\\left\\{\\frac{dy}{dt} + 2y(t)\\right\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{3\\delta(t)\\}\n$$\nBy the linearity of the Laplace transform, this can be written as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}\\left\\{\\frac{dy}{dt}\\right\\} + 2\\mathcal{L}\\{y(t)\\} = 3\\mathcal{L}\\{\\delta(t)\\}\n$$\nNow, we use the standard properties of the Laplace transform. The transform of the derivative $y'(t)$ is given by $\\mathcal{L}\\{y'(t)\\} = sY(s) - y(0^-)$. It is important to use the value of the function at $t=0^-$ because the forcing term involves an impulse at $t=0$, which can cause a discontinuity in $y(t)$ at $t=0$.\nThe Laplace transform of the Dirac delta function centered at the origin is $\\mathcal{L}\\{\\delta(t)\\} = 1$.\n\nSubstituting these properties and the given initial condition $y(0^-) = -1$ into the transformed equation, we get:\n$$\n(sY(s) - y(0^-)) + 2Y(s) = 3(1)\n$$\n$$\n(sY(s) - (-1)) + 2Y(s) = 3\n$$\n$$\nsY(s) + 1 + 2Y(s) = 3\n$$\nNow, we solve this algebraic equation for $Y(s)$.

The presence of the delta function implies the solution is considered in the context of distributions, and for $t>0$, the delta function is zero, so the equation becomes homogeneous. We can verify that our solution $y(t) = 2e^{-2t}$ gives $y(0^+) = \\lim_{t\\to 0^+} 2e^{-2t} = 2$. The jump across $t=0$ is $y(0^+) - y(0^-) = 2 - (-1) = 3$.
