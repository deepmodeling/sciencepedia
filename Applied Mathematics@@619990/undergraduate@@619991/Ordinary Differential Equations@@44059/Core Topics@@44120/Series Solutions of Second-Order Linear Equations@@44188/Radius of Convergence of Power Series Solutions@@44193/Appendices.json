A singular point is a point where either $p(x)$ or $q(x)$ is not analytic.\n\nIn our case, $p(x) = 0$ is analytic everywhere, so its radius of convergence is infinite. The function $q(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2 - b^2}$ is a rational function. Its singularities occur where the denominator is zero.\n$$x^2 - b^2 = 0 \\implies x^2 = b^2 \\implies x = \\pm b$$\nSince $b$ is a real constant, the singular points are $s_1 = b$ and $s_2 = -b$, both on the real axis.\n\nThe power series solution is centered at $x_0 = 1$. The guaranteed radius of convergence, $R$, is the minimum of the distances from the center $x_0$ to each of the singular points.

The midpoint between $-1$ and $1$ is $0$.\n\nWe can analyze this by considering two cases based on the value of $b$:\n\nCase 1: $b \\ge 0$.\nIn this case, $b$ is closer to $1$ (or equidistant if $b=0$).

This is consistent with our assumption $b \\ge 0$.\n1b) $b-1 = -4 \\implies b = -3$. This contradicts our assumption $b \\ge 0$, so it is not a valid solution for this case.\nThus, from Case 1, we get $b=5$.\n\nCase 2: $b  0$.\nIn this case, $b$ is closer to $-1$. Therefore, the minimum distance is $|b+1|$.\nThe equation becomes $|b+1| = 4$.\nThis gives two possibilities:\n2a) $b+1 = 4 \\implies b = 3$.
