This exercise [@problem_id:2198585] asks you to compare the series solutions for two fundamental equations, including the Airy equation, to understand how the ODE's coefficients determine the structure of the recurrence relation. By analyzing why one equation yields a relation between coefficients two indices apart versus three indices apart, you will gain a much deeper intuition for the power series method and how the form of the equation dictates the form of the solution.", "problem": "Consider the task of finding power series solutions of the form $y(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n x^n$ around the ordinary point $x_0 = 0$ for the following two second-order linear ordinary differential equations:\n\nEquation (I): $y'' + y = 0$\nEquation (II): $y'' + xy = 0$\n\nUpon deriving the recurrence relations for the coefficients $a_n$, a key structural difference emerges. For Equation (I), the recurrence relation links coefficients whose indices are separated by 2 (e.g., it relates $a_{n+2}$ to $a_n$). This leads to two independent sets of coefficients, one for even indices and one for odd indices. For Equation (II), the recurrence relation links coefficients whose indices are separated by 3 (e.g., it relates $a_{n+2}$ to $a_{n-1}$). This leads to three independent sets of coefficients, based on their index modulo 3.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct mathematical explanation for why the index separation in the recurrence relation is 2 for Equation (I) but 3 for Equation (II)?\n\nA. In Equation (II), the variable coefficient $x$ is not analytic at $x=0$, which fundamentally alters the structure of the series, increasing the index separation by one compared to Equation (I).\n\nB. The multiplication of the power series for $y(x)$ by the term $x$ in Equation (II) produces a series of the form $\\sum a_n x^{n+1}$. When this is re-indexed to match the powers of $x$ from the $y''$ term (which are of the form $x^{k}$), the coefficient becomes $a_{k-1}$. This creates a relation between $a_{k+2}$ (from $y''$) and $a_{k-1}$ (from $xy$), whose indices are separated by 3.\n\nC. Any second-order differential equation with a constant coefficient for the $y$ term will produce a recurrence relation with an index separation of 2, while any such equation with a linear coefficient $a(x)y$ where $a(x)$ has degree 1 will produce a recurrence relation with an index separation of 3.\n\nD. The index separation is given by $m+d$, where $m$ is the order of the highest derivative (which is 2 for both equations) and $d$ is the degree of the polynomial coefficient of the $y$ term. Thus, for Equation (I), $d=0$ gives separation $2+0=2$, and for Equation (II), $d=1$ gives separation $2+1=3$.\n\nE. Equation (II) requires three initial conditions ($a_0, a_1, a_2$) to determine the series, whereas Equation (I) only requires two ($a_0, a_1$).

The origin of this separation is the factor $x$ multiplying $y$, which shifts the series by one power so that, after reindexing to match the $x^{n}$ powers coming from $y''$, the $xy$ contribution at $x^{n}$ carries coefficient $a_{n-1}$. Therefore the correct explanation is that multiplying by $x$ produces a one-step shift in the power series, and aligning with the $y''$ series (already reindexed to $x^{n}$) yields a recurrence linking indices differing by $3$.\n\nEvaluating the options:\nA is false because $x$ is analytic at $x=0$.\nB correctly describes the effect of multiplying by $x$ and the subsequent reindexing that yields $a_{k-1}$ and hence the index gap of $3$.\nC and D are overgeneralizations; the gap depends on how series terms align after all products and reindexings and can be affected by other terms (such as $y'$) and non-polynomial coefficients.\nE is false; the equation is second order and requires only two initial conditions.
