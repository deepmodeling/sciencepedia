The motion of a component is described by its displacement $x(t)$ from an equilibrium position. For this system, the governing equation of motion is a homogeneous second-order linear differential equation:\n$$m \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + k x = 0$$\nHere, $m$ and $k$ are positive physical constants of the system representing mass and stiffness, respectively.\n\nThrough experimental analysis, the engineer finds that one possible non-trivial motion for the component is described by the function $x_1(t) = C \\cos(\\omega t)$, where $C$ is a non-zero amplitude and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency.\n\nNow, the engineer considers a hypothetical motion with a different amplitude, given by $x_2(t) = 5 C \\cos(\\omega t)$.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly assesses whether $x_2(t)$ is also a valid physical solution to the governing equation?\n\nA. No, because changing the amplitude requires a corresponding change in the system's mass $m$ or stiffness $k$.\nB. Yes, because for any function that is a solution, any constant multiple of that function is also a solution to this type of equation.\nC. It is impossible to determine without knowing the specific numerical values of the constants $m$, $k$, and $C$.\nD.
