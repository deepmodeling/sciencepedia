This practice challenges you to apply the fundamental criterion for SHM—a restoring force, and thus acceleration, that is directly proportional to the negative of the displacement—to a common physical scenario. By analyzing the forces acting on a bouncing ball, you will develop a more rigorous understanding of what truly constitutes simple harmonic motion. [@problem_id:2214090]", "problem": "A small, perfectly elastic ball of mass $m$ is dropped from a height $H$ onto a perfectly rigid, horizontal surface. It then bounces vertically, always returning to the same height $H$ due to the perfectly elastic nature of the collisions. Let $y$ be the vertical position of the ball, measured positive upwards from the surface, so the surface is at $y=0$. The ball's motion is thus confined to the range $0 \\le y \\le H$. Let $g$ be the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity. The duration of each collision with the surface is non-zero but extremely short. We are interested in determining if this periodic motion can be classified as simple harmonic motion.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the acceleration, $a$, of the ball as a function of its position, $y$?\n\nA. The acceleration is directly proportional to the negative of the displacement from the midpoint of the motion: $a \\propto -(y - H/2)$.\n\nB. The acceleration has a constant value $a = -g$ throughout the entire motion, including the bounce.\n\nC. The acceleration has a constant value $a = -g$ whenever the ball is not in contact with the surface ($y > 0$), and it becomes a large, positive value for a brief interval of time during the bounce at $y=0$.\n\nD. The acceleration is zero at the peak of the trajectory ($y=H$) and is a large negative value during the bounce at $y=0$.\n\nE. The acceleration is a linear function of position, given by $a = g(1 - 2y/H)$.", "solution": "Let $y$ be measured upward from the surface, with $y=0$ at the surface and $0 \\le y \\le H$. The vertical acceleration is $a=\\ddot{y}$. By Newton’s second law, $m\\ddot{y}=\\sum F_{y}$ at each instant.\n\nDuring free flight (when the ball is not in contact with the surface, so $y0$), the only vertical force is gravity, $F_{g}=-mg$. Hence\n$$\nm\\ddot{y}=-mg \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a=\\ddot{y}=-g.\n$$\n\nDuring the brief collision at $y=0$, there is an additional upward normal force $N(t)$ from the surface. Then\n$$\nm\\ddot{y}=N(t)-mg \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a=\\ddot{y}=\\frac{N(t)}{m}-g.\n$$\nBecause the collision is perfectly elastic, the speed just after the bounce equals the speed just before, with reversed sign. Let $v^{-}$ be the velocity just before impact and $v^{+}$ just after. The impulse from the surface over the short contact time $\\Delta t$ satisfies\n$$\n\\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{0}+\\Delta t} N(t)\\,dt = m\\left(v^{+}-v^{-}\\right) + \\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{0}+\\Delta t} mg\\,dt.\n$$\nWith $\\Delta t$ very small, the gravitational impulse $\\int mg\\,dt$ is negligible compared to the normal impulse required to reverse the velocity, so $\\int N(t)\\,dt$ is large and positive. Consequently $N(t)$, and thus $a=\\frac{N(t)}{m}-g$, is large and positive for a very short time interval during contact.\n\nTherefore:\n- For $y0$ (no contact), $a=-g$.\n- At $y=0$ during the brief collision, $a$ becomes large and positive for a short interval.\n\nThis behavior is not simple harmonic motion, which would require $a$ to be proportional to the negative of the displacement from equilibrium, $a=-\\omega^{2}\\left(y-y_{0}\\right)$, i.e., linear in $y$ at all times. Options proposing $a$ linear in $y$ (A or E) are incorrect. It is also incorrect that $a=-g$ during the bounce (B), and $a$ is not zero at the peak (at $y=H$, $a=-g$), nor large negative during the bounce (D). The only accurate description is that $a=-g$ in flight and becomes a large positive value briefly during the bounce.\n\nHence the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2214090"}, {"introduction": "A graph of position versus time tells only part of an oscillator's story; to see the full picture, we can turn to the phase plane.
