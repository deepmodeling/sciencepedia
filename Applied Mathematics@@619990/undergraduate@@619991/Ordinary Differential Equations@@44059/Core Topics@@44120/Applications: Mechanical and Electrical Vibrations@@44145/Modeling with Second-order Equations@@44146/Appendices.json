This problem introduces damping by modeling the motion of a fluid in a U-shaped tube, a system analogous to many manometers and fluid-based sensors. You will add a viscous drag term to the equation of motion, creating a damped harmonic oscillator, and then determine the precise amount of damping needed to achieve critical damping—the state where the system returns to equilibrium as quickly as possible without oscillating [@problem_id:2187197].

The motion of the liquid column is also opposed by a viscous drag force that is linearly proportional to the instantaneous velocity of the fluid. This force can be modeled as $F_{drag} = -b \\dot{y}$, where $y(t)$ is the vertical displacement of the liquid surface in one arm from its equilibrium level, and $b$ is the viscous damping coefficient.\n\nFor an application in a measurement device, it is required that the system be critically damped.
