This exercise places you in the role of a peer reviewer, tasked with evaluating a claim about an unknown differential equation. By focusing on a specific observation—that slopes are constant along horizontal lines—you can rigorously test a proposed equation and identify the flaw in the reasoning, thereby sharpening your ability to use graphical evidence to validate or falsify a mathematical model [@problem_id:2169743].", "problem": "An undergraduate student is analyzing a direction field plotted in the $ty$-plane for an unknown first-order differential equation of the form $y' = f(t, y)$. The student carefully observes that along any horizontal line, all the tangent line segments appear to have the same slope. For example, the slope appears to be the same at point $P_1 = (0, 1)$ and point $P_2 = (3, 1)$. Likewise, the slope at point $Q_1 = (-2, -4)$ is observed to be identical to the slope at point $Q_2 = (1, -4)$.\n\nBased on a general impression of the field, the student proposes that the differential equation is:\n$$y' = y + t$$\nYour task is to identify the flaw in the student's reasoning. Which of the following statements provides a direct contradiction between the student's specific observation and their proposed equation?\n\nA. The lines of constant slope (isoclines) for the equation $y' = y+t$ have a slope of $-1$ in the $ty$-plane, which are not horizontal lines.\n\nB. For the equation $y' = y+t$, the slope at the origin $(0,0)$ must be zero, which is information not provided by the student's observation.\n\nC. A calculation using the proposed equation shows that the slope at point $P_1 = (0, 1)$ is different from the slope at point $P_2 = (3, 1)$.\n\nD. The student's observation implies the differential equation is autonomous, but the equation $y' = y+t$ is non-autonomous.\n\nE.

This means that for any $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$,\n$$\nf(t_{1}, y_{0}) = f(t_{2}, y_{0}).\n$$\nSince this must hold for all $t_{1}, t_{2}$ at a fixed $y_{0}$, $f$ does not depend on $t$. Hence there exists a function $g$ such that\n$$\nf(t,y) = g(y),\n$$\nso the differential equation must be autonomous.\n\n3) For the proposed equation $y' = y + t$, the slope function is $f(t,y) = y + t$, which depends on $t$. Along a horizontal line $y = y_{0}$, we have\n$$\nf(t, y_{0}) = y_{0} + t,\n$$\nwhich varies with $t$ and therefore cannot be constant along that horizontal line.\n\n4) Applying this directly to the student’s specific observation at $P_{1} = (0,1)$ and $P_{2} = (3,1)$, the proposed equation gives slopes\n$$\nf(0,1) = 1 + 0, \\quad f(3,1) = 1 + 3,\n$$\nand since $0 \\neq 3$, these slopes are not equal.
