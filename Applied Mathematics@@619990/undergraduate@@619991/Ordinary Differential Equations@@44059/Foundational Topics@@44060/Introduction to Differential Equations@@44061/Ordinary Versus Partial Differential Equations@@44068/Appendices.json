The choice between an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) and a Partial Differential Equation (PDE) depends critically on the assumptions made about the system's spatial structure. An ODE describes a system where the dependent variables are functions of a single independent variable (usually time), while a PDE is required when dependent variables are functions of two or more independent variables (e.g., time and one or more spatial coordinates).\n\nConsider the population of yeast, $P$, growing in a bioreactor. You are tasked with determining the appropriate type of differential equation to model the yeast population under several different experimental conditions.\n\nAnalyze the five scenarios described below.\n\nA. A small, continuously stirred tank reactor is used. The nutrient medium is kept constant and uniform throughout the reactor at all times. The yeast population is assumed to be perfectly mixed, resulting in a spatially uniform population density at any given instant.\n\nB. The experiment is conducted in a long, unstirred tube. A nutrient-rich gel is placed at one end ($x=0$), and the nutrients slowly diffuse down the tube. Yeast cells are initially distributed uniformly but their growth rate depends on the local nutrient concentration. The population density varies along the length of the tube.\n\nC. The setup is the same as in scenario A (a well-mixed reactor), but the control system is programmed to vary the rate of nutrient supply sinusoidally with time to study the population's response to fluctuating resource availability. The population density remains spatially uniform.\n\nD. A tall, cylindrical bioreactor is used. It is not mechanically stirred. A heating element at the bottom of the reactor maintains a constant high temperature, while the top is cooled, creating a stable vertical temperature gradient. The yeast's metabolic and growth rates are sensitive to temperature. The population density varies with height.\n\nE. The setup is the same as in scenario A (a well-mixed reactor with constant nutrients), but a filtering system is attached that continuously removes a fixed fraction of the yeast population per hour to simulate predation or harvesting.\n\nWhich of the following scenarios would necessarily require a Partial Differential Equation (PDE) to accurately model the yeast population as a function of time and space? Select all that apply.", "solution": "We distinguish ODEs from PDEs by the number of independent variables on which the dependent variable depends. If the population density is spatially uniform, we can write $P=P(t)$ and an ODE such as\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt}=F(P,t)\n$$\nsuffices. If the population density varies over space, we must represent $P=P(x,t)$ (or $P=P(z,t)$, etc.), and the governing equation becomes a PDE in the sense that it involves partial derivatives with respect to $t$ (and typically also spatial derivatives when transport processes like diffusion or advection are present), e.g.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial t}=\\mathcal{L}_{x}[P]+G(P,\\ldots,x,t),\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}_{x}$ denotes a spatial operator (such as diffusion, $\\mathcal{L}_{x}[P]=D\\,\\partial^{2}P/\\partial x^{2}$), and $G$ collects reaction terms that may depend on local fields (nutrients, temperature).\n\nScenario A: The reactor is well mixed and both medium and population are spatially uniform. The state is $P=P(t)$, so an ODE like\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt}=r\\,P\n$$\nis appropriate. A PDE is not necessary.\n\nScenario B: The tube is unstirred, nutrients diffuse along $x$, and growth depends on the local nutrient concentration. Population density varies along $x$, so $P=P(x,t)$ and nutrient $N=N(x,t)$ satisfy coupled PDEs, for example\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial t}=D_{N}\\frac{\\partial^{2}N}{\\partial x^{2}}-H(P,N),\\qquad\n\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial t}=D_{P}\\frac{\\partial^{2}P}{\\partial x^{2}}+G(P,N),\n$$\nwith $D_{N}$ and $D_{P}$ diffusion coefficients and $H,G$ local interaction terms. A PDE is necessary.\n\nScenario C: The reactor is well mixed with time-varying nutrient supply; the population remains spatially uniform. The state is $P=P(t)$ and an ODE with time-dependent forcing such as\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt}=r(t)\\,P\n$$\nsuffices. A PDE is not necessary.\n\nScenario D: There is a vertical temperature gradient and the population density varies with height $z$, so $P=P(z,t)$. Because growth depends on local temperature $T=T(z)$, a space-resolved model is required. A representative PDE is\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial t}=D\\frac{\\partial^{2}P}{\\partial z^{2}}+r(T(z))\\,P,\n$$\nwhere $D$ captures any vertical mixing or dispersal; even in the limiting case $D=0$, the model is a space-resolved evolution equation for $P(z,t)$ involving a partial derivative in $t$ and spatial dependence in the coefficients, which necessarily treats $P$ as a function of time and space. Thus, a PDE framework is required to accurately model $P$ as a function of time and space.\n\nScenario E: The reactor is well mixed with constant nutrients and continuous removal at a fixed fractional rate. The state is $P=P(t)$ and an ODE such as\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt}=r\\,P-\\alpha\\,P\n$$\nsuffices. A PDE is not necessary.\n\nTherefore, the scenarios that necessarily require a PDE to model the yeast population as a function of time and space are B and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BD}$$", "id": "2190135"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the conceptual choice between ODEs and PDEs, let's now apply this to a classic physical scenario.
