{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Determining the order of a differential equation is the first step in its classification and analysis. This exercise demonstrates a crucial preliminary step: ensuring the equation is in its fully expanded form. Before you can identify the highest-order derivative, you must first carry out any indicated differentiations, a process that can sometimes reveal a higher order than is immediately apparent [@problem_id:2189608].", "problem": "Consider the following ordinary differential equation in which $y$ is a function of the independent variable $x$, and $y'$ denotes the first derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 y') + y = 0\n$$\nTo properly classify a differential equation, it must first be written in its fully expanded form, where all indicated differentiations have been performed. Determine the order of this differential equation.", "solution": "We are given the differential equation\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(x^{2}y'\\right)+y=0.\n$$\nTo determine the order, we first expand the derivative using the product rule. The product rule states that for functions $u(x)$ and $v(x)$, $\\frac{d}{dx}(uv)=u'v+uv'$. Here, take $u(x)=x^2$ and $v(x)=y'$, so $u'(x)=2x$ and $v'(x)=y''$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(x^{2}y'\\right)=(x^{2})'y'+x^{2}y''=2x\\,y'+x^{2}y''.\n$$\nSubstituting this into the original equation gives the fully expanded form\n$$\nx^{2}y''+2x\\,y'+y=0.\n$$\nThe order of a differential equation is the highest order of derivative of the dependent variable that appears in the equation. In this expanded form, the highest derivative is $y''$, which is of second order. Therefore, the order of the differential equation is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2189608"}, {"introduction": "Real-world physical systems often lead to differential equations with non-linear terms. This practice explores such a scenario, modeling a system where damping is proportional to the magnitude of velocity. It challenges a common misconception by asking you to consider whether non-linearity, introduced here by an absolute value function, affects the fundamental classification of the equation's order [@problem_id:2189592].", "problem": "Consider the following ordinary differential equation, which can be used to model a physical system with a damping force proportional to the magnitude of its velocity but always opposing the motion:\n$$y''(t) + \\alpha |y'(t)| + \\beta y(t) = 0$$\nwhere $y(t)$ is the displacement of the system at time $t$, and $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are positive real constants.

The order is undefined because the absolute value function $|y'(t)|$ is not differentiable everywhere.", "solution": "We recall the definition: the order of an ordinary differential equation is the highest order of derivative of the unknown function that appears in the equation.\n\nConsider the given equation:\n$$y''(t) + \\alpha |y'(t)| + \\beta y(t) = 0.$$\nThe derivatives present are $y''(t)$ (second derivative), $y'(t)$ (first derivative), and $y(t)$ (zeroth derivative). The highest derivative that appears is $y''(t)$, which is of order two.\n\nNonlinearity, such as the presence of $|y'(t)|$, does not affect the definition of order. Similarly, the fact that $|y'(t)|$ is not differentiable with respect to $y'$ at $y'=0$ does not change the order of the differential equation; it only affects smoothness and certain analytical properties, not the order. Therefore, the order is determined solely by the highest derivative present, which is two.\n\nHence, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2189592"}, {"introduction": "The order of a differential equation not only describes its structure but also dictates the nature of its general solution. This problem reverses the typical perspective: instead of finding the solution from the equation, you will deduce the order of the equation from its known general solution. This exercise illuminates a fundamental principle for linear homogeneous ODEs, which connects the order to the number of arbitrary constants required to describe every possible solution [@problem_id:2189602].", "problem": "A theoretical model for a mechanical system is described by a linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation with real, continuous coefficients on the domain $x > 0$.
