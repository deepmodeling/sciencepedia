The maximal interval of existence is the largest such interval.\n\nIn this problem, the system is homogeneous, meaning $\\vec{g}(t) = \\vec{0}$, which is continuous for all real $t$. Therefore, we only need to consider the continuity of the entries of the matrix $A(t)$.\nThe matrix is given by:\n$$ A(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} a_{11}(t) & a_{12}(t) \\\\ a_{21}(t) & a_{22}(t) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} t^2 & \\frac{1}{t+1} \\\\ \\ln(5-t) & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nWe will find the domain of continuity for each entry of the matrix $A(t)$:\n\n1.

The entry $a_{12}(t) = \\frac{1}{t+1}$ is a rational function. It is continuous everywhere except where its denominator is zero. The denominator is zero when $t+1 = 0$, which means $t = -1$. Thus, the domain of continuity for $a_{12}(t)$ is $(-\\infty, -1) \\cup (-1, \\infty)$.\n\n3.  The entry $a_{21}(t) = \\ln(5-t)$ is a logarithmic function. The natural logarithm $\\ln(u)$ is defined and continuous for $u > 0$.

The entry $a_{22}(t) = 0$ is a constant function, which is continuous for all real numbers $t$.
