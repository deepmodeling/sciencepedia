This violates Lyapunov stability.\n\nTherefore, $x_{0}=0$ is not Lyapunov stable (due to repulsion from the left) but attracts solutions from the right; it is semi-stable.\n\nAmong the options, this corresponds to statement C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2184617"}, {"introduction": "The behavior of many systems depends critically on adjustable parameters.

For all $\\mu > \\mu_c$, there are always two steady-states, one stable and one unstable.", "solution": "To analyze the steady-state solutions and their stability, we first need to find the equilibrium points of the system. An equilibrium point, or steady-state solution, $x_{eq}$, occurs when the rate of change of the potential is zero.\nLet $f(x, \\mu) = x - \\mu \\exp(-x)$. The equilibrium points are the solutions to the equation $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$, which is:\n$$\nx_{eq} - \\mu \\exp(-x_{eq}) = 0\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to find a relationship between $x_{eq}$ and $\\mu$:\n$$\nx_{eq} = \\mu \\exp(-x_{eq})\n$$\nTo better analyze the number of solutions, we can write this as:\n$$\n\\mu = x_{eq} \\exp(x_{eq})\n$$\nThe number of equilibrium points for a given $\\mu$ is determined by the number of solutions $x_{eq}$ to this equation. Let's define a function $g(x) = x \\exp(x)$. The equilibrium points are the intersections of the graph of $g(x)$ with the horizontal line $y = \\mu$.\n\nTo understand the shape of $g(x)$, we can use calculus to find its critical points. The derivative of $g(x)$ with respect to $x$ is:\n$$\ng'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x \\exp(x)) = 1 \\cdot \\exp(x) + x \\cdot \\exp(x) = (1+x)\\exp(x)\n$$\nThe critical points occur when $g'(x) = 0$. Since $\\exp(x)$ is always positive, this equation is satisfied only when $1+x=0$, which gives $x = -1$.\nTo determine if this is a minimum or maximum, we can check the second derivative, or analyze the sign of $g'(x)$. For $x < -1$, $g'(x) < 0$ (the function is decreasing). For $x > -1$, $g'(x) > 0$ (the function is increasing). Thus, $x = -1$ is a global minimum for $g(x)$.\n\nThe value of the function at this minimum is:\n$$\ng(-1) = (-1)\\exp(-1) = -\\frac{1}{e}\n$$\nThis minimum value of $g(x)$ corresponds to the critical value of the parameter $\\mu_c$. So, $\\mu_c = -1/e$. This is consistent with the problem statement that for $\\mu < \\mu_c$, there are no solutions.\n\nNow we can analyze the number of equilibrium points for $\\mu > \\mu_c$:\n1.  If $\\mu_c < \\mu < 0$ (i.e., $-1/e < \\mu < 0$), the horizontal line $y=\\mu$ intersects the graph of $g(x)$ at two distinct points, $x_1$ and $x_2$. From the graph of $g(x)$, one solution is in the interval $(-\\infty, -1)$ and the other is in $(-1, 0)$. So, there are two equilibrium points.\n2.  If $\\mu = 0$, the equation becomes $x \\exp(x) = 0$, which has a single solution $x = 0$. There is one equilibrium point.\n3.  If $\\mu > 0$, the line $y=\\mu$ intersects the graph of $g(x)$ at exactly one point, with $x > 0$. There is one equilibrium point.\n\nNext, we determine the stability of these equilibrium points using linearization. The stability of an equilibrium point $x_{eq}$ is determined by the sign of the derivative of the original function $f(x, \\mu) = x - \\mu \\exp(-x)$ evaluated at $x_{eq}$. Let's find $f'(x) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x - \\mu \\exp(-x)) = 1 - \\mu(-\\exp(-x)) = 1 + \\mu \\exp(-x)\n$$\nAn equilibrium point $x_{eq}$ is stable if $f'(x_{eq}) < 0$ and unstable if $f'(x_{eq}) > 0$.\nAt an equilibrium point, we know that $\\mu = x_{eq} \\exp(x_{eq})$. We can substitute this into the expression for $f'(x_{eq})$:\n$$\nf'(x_{eq}) = 1 + (x_{eq} \\exp(x_{eq})) \\exp(-x_{eq}) = 1 + x_{eq}\n$$\nSo, the stability simply depends on whether $x_{eq}$ is greater or less than $-1$.\n-   An equilibrium is stable if $1 + x_{eq} < 0 \\implies x_{eq} < -1$.\n-   An equilibrium is unstable if $1 + x_{eq} > 0 \\implies x_{eq} > -1$.\n\nLet's combine this with our analysis of the number of equilibria:\n1.  For $\\mu_c < \\mu < 0$: We have two equilibria, $x_1$ and $x_2$. We established that $x_1 < -1$ and $-1 < x_2 < 0$.\n    -   For $x_1$: Stability is determined by $1+x_1$. Since $x_1 < -1$, $1+x_1 < 0$. This equilibrium is **stable**.\n    -   For $x_2$: Stability is determined by $1+x_2$. Since $x_2 > -1$, $1+x_2 > 0$. This equilibrium is **unstable**.\n    So in this range, there are two steady-states: one stable and one unstable.\n\n2.  For $\\mu \\geq 0$: We have one equilibrium, $x_{eq}$.\n    -   If $\\mu = 0$, $x_{eq} = 0$.\n    -   If $\\mu > 0$, $x_{eq} > 0$.\n    In both cases, $x_{eq} \\geq 0$, which means $x_{eq} > -1$. The stability is determined by $1+x_{eq}$, which is positive. This equilibrium is **unstable**.\n    So in this range, there is one unstable steady-state.\n\nSummarizing the behavior for $\\mu > \\mu_c$:\n-   For $\\mu_c < \\mu < 0$, there are two steady-states, one stable and one unstable.\n-   For $\\mu \\geq 0$, there is one unstable steady-state.\n\nThis combined description perfectly matches option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2184632"}]}
