The Picard-Lindelöf theorem provides a set of sufficient conditions for guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of a solution to a general IVP, $y'(t) = f(t, y)$ with $y(t_0) = y_0$, within some interval around $t_0$. The two main conditions are:\n1. The function $f(t, y)$ is continuous in a rectangular domain $D = \\{(t, y) : |t-t_0| \\le a, |y-y_0| \\le b \\}$.\n2. The function $f(t, y)$ satisfies a Lipschitz condition with respect to the variable $y$ in the domain $D$.
