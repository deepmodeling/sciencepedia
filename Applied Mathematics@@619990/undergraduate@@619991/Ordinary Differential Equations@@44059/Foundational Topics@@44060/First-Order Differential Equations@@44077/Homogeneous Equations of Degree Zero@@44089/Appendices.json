This conceptual exercise challenges you to think about the geometric meaning of homogeneity, which is scale-invariance with respect to the origin. By analyzing why a specific family of parabolas *cannot* be described by a homogeneous ODE, you will solidify your understanding of the foundational principle that unifies this entire class of equations [@problem_id:2178101].", "problem": "A first-order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) written in the form $\\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x, y)$ is classified as homogeneous of degree zero if the slope function $f(x, y)$ remains unchanged when its arguments are scaled by a common factor $t$. That is, $f(tx, ty) = f(x, y)$ for any non-zero scalar $t$. A key geometric implication of this property is that the family of integral curves (the solution curves) for such an ODE is invariant under a homothety, which is a uniform scaling transformation centered at the origin. If a curve is a solution, then any scaled version of that curve is also a solution.\n\nConsider the family of parabolas described by the equation $y = x^2 + C$, where $C$ is an arbitrary real constant. This family consists of identical parabolas whose vertices are shifted vertically along the y-axis. The differential equation that has this family as its general solution is not homogeneous of degree zero.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct reason for this fact?\n\nA.

The slope of the tangent line to any curve in the family depends only on the $x$-coordinate.\n\nE. It is impossible to eliminate the parameter $C$ to obtain a single first-order ODE for the entire family.", "solution": "To determine why the family of curves $y = x^2 + C$ cannot be described by a single homogeneous Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) of degree zero, we will first find the ODE that represents this family and then analyze it both algebraically and geometrically.\n\nStep 1: Derive the differential equation for the family of curves.\nThe family of curves is given by the equation $y = x^2 + C$, where $C$ is a parameter. To find the differential equation for the family, we must eliminate this parameter. We can do this by differentiating the equation with respect to $x$.\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx}(y) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 + C) $$\n$$ \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x $$\nThis is the first-order ODE whose general solution is the family of parabolas $y = x^2 + C$. The slope function is $f(x, y) = 2x$.\n\nStep 2: Algebraically test for homogeneity of degree zero.\nAn ODE $\\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x, y)$ is homogeneous of degree zero if $f(tx, ty) = f(x, y)$ for any non-zero scalar $t$. Let's test our slope function $f(x, y) = 2x$.\n$$ f(tx, ty) = 2(tx) = t(2x) = t \\cdot f(x, y) $$\nSince $f(tx, ty) = t \\cdot f(x, y) \\neq f(x, y)$ (for $t \\neq 1$), the slope function is not homogeneous of degree zero. (It is, in fact, homogeneous of degree one). This algebraic test confirms that the ODE is not homogeneous of degree zero.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the geometric interpretation.\nThe geometric property of a family of curves described by a homogeneous ODE of degree zero is that the family must be invariant under a uniform scaling (homothety) about the origin. This means that if we take any curve in the family and scale all of its points $(x, y)$ by a factor $t$ to get new points $(x', y') = (tx, ty)$, the new curve composed of these points must also be a member of the original family.\n\nLet's test this for our family of parabolas, $y = x^2 + C$.\nPick an arbitrary curve from the family, say for $C = C_0$. Its equation is $y = x^2 + C_0$. Let $(x, y)$ be a point on this curve.\nNow, scale this point by a non-zero factor $t$. The new point is $(x', y') = (tx, ty)$. We want to find the equation that relates $x'$ and $y'$.\nFrom the transformation, we have $x = \\frac{x'}{t}$ and $y = \\frac{y'}{t}$.\nSubstitute these into the equation of our original curve:\n$$ \\frac{y'}{t} = \\left(\\frac{x'}{t}\\right)^2 + C_0 $$\n$$ \\frac{y'}{t} = \\frac{(x')^2}{t^2} + C_0 $$\nNow, we solve for $y'$ in terms of $x'$ to see the form of the scaled curve:\n$$ y' = t \\left( \\frac{(x')^2}{t^2} + C_0 \\right) $$\n$$ y' = \\frac{1}{t}(x')^2 + tC_0 $$\nThe equation of the scaled curve is of the form $y = \\frac{1}{t} x^2 + (tC_0)$. For this scaled curve to be a member of the original family $y = x^2 + C$, its equation must be of the form $y = (1)x^2 + C_{\\text{new}}$ for some new constant $C_{\\text{new}}$.\nOur scaled curve has the form $y = \\frac{1}{t} x^2 + \\dots$. The coefficient of the $x^2$ term is $\\frac{1}{t}$. This coefficient is only equal to 1 if $t=1$ (the trivial case of no scaling). For any other scaling factor $t \\neq 1$, the shape of the parabola itself changes (it becomes wider or narrower), so the resulting curve is not of the form $y=x^2+C$.\nTherefore, the family of curves $y = x^2 + C$ is not invariant under scaling from the origin.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the given options.\nA. The vertex of each parabola, $(0, C)$, is different, meaning the family of curves is not centered at the origin. While true, this is not the direct reason. A family of curves can be centered at the origin (e.g., $y=Cx$) and still not be a solution to a homogeneous ODE of degree zero. Conversely, the family of circles $x^2+y^2=C$ is not centered at the origin (only one is), but it is the solution to a homogeneous ODE $dy/dx=-x/y$.\n\nB. The differential equation governing the family is a nonlinear ODE. This is false. As we found, the ODE is $\\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x$, which is a linear first-order ODE.\n\nC. A uniform scaling of any parabola in the family with respect to the origin does not result in another parabola belonging to the same family. Our geometric analysis in Step 3 proved this statement to be true. This failure of scale-invariance is the fundamental geometric reason why the governing ODE is not homogeneous of degree zero.\n\nD. The slope of the tangent line to any curve in the family depends only on the $x$-coordinate. This is a true statement ($\\frac{dy}{dx}=2x$), and it is the algebraic reason the ODE isn't homogeneous of degree zero (as it's not a function of $g(y/x)$). However, option C provides the equivalent, and more fundamental, geometric reason that the question asks for. The failure of the slope function to be of the form $g(y/x)$ is directly equivalent to the failure of the solution curves to be scale-invariant. Option C describes this geometric failure directly.\n\nE. It is impossible to eliminate the parameter $C$ to obtain a single first-order ODE for the entire family. This is false. We successfully eliminated $C$ in Step 1 to get $\\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x$.\n\nConclusion: The correct reason is the failure of the family of curves to be closed under uniform scaling from the origin, as described in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2178101"}, {"introduction": "This final practice presents a more advanced challenge where the differential equation is not given in an explicit form.
