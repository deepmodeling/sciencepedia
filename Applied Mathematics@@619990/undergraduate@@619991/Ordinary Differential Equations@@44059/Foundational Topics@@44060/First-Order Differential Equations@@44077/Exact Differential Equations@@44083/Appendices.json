That is, the condition for exactness is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial x}\n$$\nFirst, we compute the partial derivative of $M$ with respect to $y$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(6xy^2 + \\cos(y)) = 12xy - \\sin(y)\n$$\nNext, we compute the partial derivative of $N$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(kx^2y - x\\sin(y)) = 2kxy - \\sin(y)\n$$\nNow, we set these two partial derivatives equal to each other to find the value of $k$:\n$$\n12xy - \\sin(y) = 2kxy - \\sin(y)\n$$\nAdding $\\sin(y)$ to both sides gives:\n$$\n12xy = 2kxy\n$$\nFor this equation to hold true for all values of $x$ and $y$, the coefficients must be equal. Thus:\n$$\n12 = 2k \\implies k = 6\n$$\nNow that we have the value of $k$, the exact differential equation is:\n$$\n(6xy^2 + \\cos(y))dx + (6x^2y - x\\sin(y))dy = 0\n$$\nWe need to find the potential function $F(x,y)$ such that $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = M(x,y)$ and $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = N(x,y)$.\nLet's start by integrating $M(x,y)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\nF(x,y) = \\int M(x,y) dx = \\int (6xy^2 + \\cos(y)) dx = 3x^2y^2 + x\\cos(y) + g(y)\n$$\nHere, $g(y)$ is an arbitrary function of $y$ that acts as the \"constant\" of integration with respect to $x$.\n\nTo find $g(y)$, we differentiate our expression for $F(x,y)$ with respect to $y$ and set it equal to $N(x,y)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(3x^2y^2 + x\\cos(y) + g(y)) = 6x^2y - x\\sin(y) + g'(y)\n$$\nWe know that $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}$ must equal $N(x,y) = 6x^2y - x\\sin(y)$. So we have:\n$$\n6x^2y - x\\sin(y) + g'(y) = 6x^2y - x\\sin(y)\n$$\nThis simplifies to $g'(y) = 0$. Integrating with respect to $y$ gives $g(y) = C_0$, where $C_0$ is a constant.\nThus, the general form of the potential function is:\n$$\nF(x,y) = 3x^2y^2 + x\\cos(y) + C_0\n$$\nThe problem states the condition $F(0,0) = 5$. We use this to find the value of $C_0$:\n$$\nF(0,0) = 3(0)^2(0)^2 + (0)\\cos(0) + C_0 = 5\n$$\n$$\n0 + 0 + C_0 = 5 \\implies C_0 = 5\n$$\nSo the specific potential function is:\n$$\nF(x,y) = 3x^2y^2 + x\\cos(y) + 5\n$$\nFinally, we need to evaluate this function at the point $(x,y) = (1, \\pi)$:\n$$\nF(1, \\pi) = 3(1)^2(\\pi)^2 + (1)\\cos(\\pi) + 5\n$$\nSince $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$, we have:\n$$\nF(1, \\pi) = 3\\pi^2 - 1 + 5 = 3\\pi^2 + 4\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3\\pi^{2} + 4}$$", "id": "2172520"}, {"introduction": "Once an equation is confirmed to be exact, we can find its general solution, which is described by a potential function $\\Psi(x, y) = C$.
