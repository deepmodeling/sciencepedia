At any point $(x, y)$ on the curve, the y-intercept of the tangent line at that point is equal to $\\sqrt{1+(y')^2}$, where $y' = \\frac{dy}{dx}$ is the slope of the tangent line. This property leads to two distinct types of solutions that describe such curves: a family of straight lines and a single non-linear curve.\n\nThe family of straight lines can be written in the form $y = cx + f(c)$, where $c$ is an arbitrary constant parameter.\nThe single non-linear curve can be written in the implicit form $g(x, y) = 0$.\n\nYour task is to determine the expressions for $f(c)$ and $g(x, y)$. For the implicit form, choose the expression for $g(x,y)$ such that the constant term is $-1$. Express your answer as an ordered pair of expressions, $(f(c), g(x,y))$.", "solution": "The problem describes a geometric property of a curve $y(x)$. We first need to translate this property into a differential equation.\n\nThe equation of a line tangent to the curve $y(x)$ at an arbitrary point $(x_0, y_0)$ is given by $Y - y_0 = y'(x_0)(X - x_0)$. Here, $(X, Y)$ are the coordinates on the tangent line, and $y'(x_0)$ is the slope of the curve at $(x_0, y_0)$. To find the y-intercept of this tangent line, we set $X=0$.\n$Y_{int} - y_0 = y'(x_0)(0 - x_0)$\n$Y_{int} = y_0 - x_0 y'(x_0)$\n\nSince this must hold for any point $(x,y)$ on the curve, we can write the y-intercept as $y - x y'$. The problem states that this y-intercept is equal to $\\sqrt{1+(y')^2}$. Therefore, we have the equation:\n$y - x y' = \\sqrt{1+(y')^2}$\n\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$y = x y' + \\sqrt{1+(y')^2}$\n\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation. To simplify notation, we let $p = y' = \\frac{dy}{dx}$. The equation becomes:\n$y = xp + \\sqrt{1+p^2}$\n\nThis is a Clairaut equation, which has the general form $y = xp + f(p)$, where in this case, $f(p) = \\sqrt{1+p^2}$.\n\nTo solve a Clairaut equation, we differentiate it with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}(xp) + \\frac{d}{dx}(\\sqrt{1+p^2}) $$\nUsing the product rule for the first term and the chain rule for the second term, we get:\n$$ p = \\left(1 \\cdot p + x \\frac{dp}{dx}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{1+p^2}} \\cdot 2p \\cdot \\frac{dp}{dx}\\right) $$\n$$ p = p + x \\frac{dp}{dx} + \\frac{p}{\\sqrt{1+p^2}} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\n\nSubtracting $p$ from both sides gives:\n$$ 0 = x \\frac{dp}{dx} + \\frac{p}{\\sqrt{1+p^2}} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\n$$ 0 = \\left(x + \\frac{p}{\\sqrt{1+p^2}}\\right) \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\n\nThis equation holds if either $\\frac{dp}{dx} = 0$ or $x + \\frac{p}{\\sqrt{1+p^2}} = 0$. These two cases lead to the general and singular solutions, respectively.\n\nCase 1: The General Solution ($\\frac{dp}{dx} = 0$)\nIf $\\frac{dp}{dx} = 0$, integrating with respect to $x$ gives $p = c$, where $c$ is an arbitrary constant. Substituting $p=c$ back into the original Clairaut equation, we get:\n$y = xc + \\sqrt{1+c^2}$\nThis represents a family of straight lines. The problem asks for the function $f(c)$ in the form $y = cx + f(c)$. By comparing, we find:\n$f(c) = \\sqrt{1+c^2}$\n\nCase 2: The Singular Solution ($x + \\frac{p}{\\sqrt{1+p^2}} = 0$)\nThis second case provides a parametric representation of the singular solution. We solve for $x$ in terms of the parameter $p$:\n$x = -\\frac{p}{\\sqrt{1+p^2}}$\n\nTo find the corresponding $y$ value, we substitute this expression for $x$ back into the original Clairaut equation $y = xp + \\sqrt{1+p^2}$:\n$$ y = \\left(-\\frac{p}{\\sqrt{1+p^2}}\\right)p + \\sqrt{1+p^2} $$\n$$ y = -\\frac{p^2}{\\sqrt{1+p^2}} + \\frac{1+p^2}{\\sqrt{1+p^2}} $$\n$$ y = \\frac{-p^2 + 1 + p^2}{\\sqrt{1+p^2}} $$\n$$ y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+p^2}} $$\n\nSo, the singular solution is given parametrically by:\n$x(p) = -\\frac{p}{\\sqrt{1+p^2}}$\n$y(p) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+p^2}}$\n\nTo find the implicit equation $g(x, y) = 0$, we must eliminate the parameter $p$. We can do this by squaring both parametric equations:\n$$ x^2 = \\left(-\\frac{p}{\\sqrt{1+p^2}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{p^2}{1+p^2} $$\n$$ y^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+p^2}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{1+p^2} $$\n\nNow, we add the expressions for $x^2$ and $y^2$:\n$$ x^2 + y^2 = \\frac{p^2}{1+p^2} + \\frac{1}{1+p^2} = \\frac{p^2+1}{1+p^2} = 1 $$\nThis gives the implicit equation $x^2 + y^2 = 1$, which describes a unit circle.\nThe problem requires the form $g(x, y) = 0$ with the constant term being $-1$.
