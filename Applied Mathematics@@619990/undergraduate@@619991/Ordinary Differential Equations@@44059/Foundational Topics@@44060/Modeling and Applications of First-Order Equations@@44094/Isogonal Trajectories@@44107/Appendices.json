We do this by differentiating the given equation implicitly with respect to $x$ and then eliminating the parameter $c$.\nThe given family is:\n$$ (x+y)^2 = c(x-y) $$\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to $x$, and treating $y$ as a function of $x$ (so $\\frac{dy}{dx} = y'$), we use the chain rule:\n$$ 2(x+y) \\cdot (1+y') = c(1-y') $$\nNow, we must eliminate the parameter $c$.
