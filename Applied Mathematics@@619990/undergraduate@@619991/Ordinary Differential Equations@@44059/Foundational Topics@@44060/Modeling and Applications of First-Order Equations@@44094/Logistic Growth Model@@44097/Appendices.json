The meadow's resources, such as soil nutrients and space, are finite, and it is estimated that the carrying capacity ($K$) for this species is 2000 individual plants. A recent, thorough survey determined that the current population size ($N$) is 100 plants.\n\nTo understand the plant's intrinsic growth potential, studies were conducted under optimal laboratory conditions where resources were not limiting. In this ideal environment, the species exhibited a per-capita birth rate of $b = 0.13$ new plants per plant per year and a per-capita death rate of $d = 0.03$ deaths per plant per year.\n\nAssuming the population's growth in the meadow is governed by a logistic model, what is the current instantaneous rate of population growth ($dN/dt$)?

The problem provides these values from laboratory studies.\n$$\nr = b - d\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nr = 0.13 \\text{ year}^{-1} - 0.03 \\text{ year}^{-1} = 0.10 \\text{ year}^{-1}\n$$\n\nNow we have all the necessary parameters to calculate the instantaneous population growth rate.
