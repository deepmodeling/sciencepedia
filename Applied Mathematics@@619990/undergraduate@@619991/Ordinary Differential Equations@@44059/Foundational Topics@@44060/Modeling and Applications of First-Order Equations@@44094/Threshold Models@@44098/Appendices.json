In many biological and physical systems, these thresholds correspond to unstable equilibria—points where the rate of change is zero, but any small perturbation leads to a dramatic shift in behavior.

Ecologists model the change in the fern's total biomass, $P$, over time using a differential equation that accounts for a phenomenon known as the Allee effect, where the population's per capita growth rate increases with population density at low densities. This effect creates a critical population threshold for survival.\n\nThe rate of change of the fern's biomass, measured in kilograms (kg), with respect to time $t$, measured in years, is given by the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = r P^{2} - m P\n$$\nHere, $P(t)$ is the biomass of the fern at time $t$.
