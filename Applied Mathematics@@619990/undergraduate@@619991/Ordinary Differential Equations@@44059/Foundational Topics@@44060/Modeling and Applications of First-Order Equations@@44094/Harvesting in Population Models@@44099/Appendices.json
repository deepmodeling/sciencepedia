This problem introduces a Holling type III harvesting function, which realistically models phenomena like predator saturation, and challenges you to analyze the system's fundamental stability. Rather than just solving for a population level, you will use bifurcation analysis to find the precise \"tipping point\" where the pest population either persists or is driven to extinction, demonstrating how to identify the conditions that govern a system's qualitative fate [@problem_id:2177129].", "problem": "In an effort to manage an invasive insect species, a sterile insect release program is being modeled. In the absence of control measures, the pest population, $N(t)$, is assumed to grow exponentially with a net intrinsic rate $r$. The control measure involves releasing sterile males which mate with fertile females, effectively removing them from the reproductive pool. The rate of this removal is a function of the pest population density itself. At very low densities, encounters between sterile and fertile insects are rare. As the population grows, the removal rate increases, but it eventually saturates at a maximum rate due to the finite number of sterile insects available. This saturation effect is well-described by a Holling type III functional response.\n\nThe full population dynamics are thus given by the ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = rN - \\frac{H N^2}{A^2 + N^2} $$\nHere, $H$ is the maximum removal rate parameter, and $A$ is the pest population density at which the removal rate reaches half of its maximum effectiveness. All parameters $r, H, A$ are positive constants.\n\nIf the control measure is sufficiently strong relative to the population's growth rate, the pest population will be driven to extinction. If it is too weak, the pest population will persist at a stable, non-zero level. The transition between these two outcomes occurs at a critical point known as a saddle-node bifurcation.
