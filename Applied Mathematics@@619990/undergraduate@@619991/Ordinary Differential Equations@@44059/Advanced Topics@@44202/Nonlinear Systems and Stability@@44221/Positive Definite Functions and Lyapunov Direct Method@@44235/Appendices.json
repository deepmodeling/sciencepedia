In Lyapunov's method, this tool is a scalar function, $V$, whose properties reflect the system's behavior near an equilibrium. The most fundamental requirement for a Lyapunov function is that it must be positive definite, meaning it is zero at the equilibrium and positive everywhere else nearby. This exercise [@problem_id:2193258] provides essential practice in verifying this property for a common class of candidate functions, the quadratic forms.", "problem": "In the application of Lyapunov's direct method to analyze the stability of an equilibrium point for a two-dimensional autonomous system, a candidate function $V(x,y)$ must be constructed. A fundamental requirement for $V(x,y)$ to serve as a proper Lyapunov function is that it must be positive definite in a neighborhood of the equilibrium. A function $V(x,y)$ is said to be positive definite if $V(0,0) = 0$ and $V(x,y) > 0$ for all other points $(x,y)$ in a domain around the origin.\n\nConsider the quadratic form $V(x,y) = x^2 + cxy + 2y^2$, where $c$ is a real constant. This function is proposed as a candidate Lyapunov function for a system with an equilibrium at the origin $(0,0)$. The range of values for $c$ for which $V(x,y)$ is positive definite can be expressed as an open interval $(a, b)$.\n\nDetermine the value of the length of this interval, $b-a$.
