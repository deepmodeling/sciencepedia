This is a non-hyperbolic equilibrium point, and linear stability analysis is inconclusive. We must use non-linear methods.\n\nA powerful method for determining non-linear stability is using a Lyapunov function. A common choice for systems with odd-powered polynomial terms is a sum of even powers. Let's try the Lyapunov function candidate $V(x,y) = x^4 + y^4$.\nThis function is positive definite, as $V(x,y) > 0$ for all $(x,y) \\neq (0,0)$ and $V(0,0)=0$.\nNow, we compute the time derivative of $V$ along the trajectories of the system:\n$$ \\dot{V} = \\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}\\frac{dx}{dt} + \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y}\\frac{dy}{dt} $$\nThe partial derivatives of $V$ are $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} = 4x^3$ and $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} = 4y^3$.\nSubstituting these and the system equations into the expression for $\\dot{V}$:\n$$ \\dot{V} = (4x^3) \\left( y^3 - \\beta x(x^2+y^2) \\right) + (4y^3) \\left( -x^3 - \\beta y(x^2+y^2) \\right) $$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$ \\dot{V} = 4x^3y^3 - 4\\beta x^4(x^2+y^2) - 4y^3x^3 - 4\\beta y^4(x^2+y^2) $$\nThe $4x^3y^3$ terms cancel out, leaving:\n$$ \\dot{V} = -4\\beta x^4(x^2+y^2) - 4\\beta y^4(x^2+y^2) $$\nFactoring out common terms:\n$$ \\dot{V} = -4\\beta (x^4+y^4)(x^2+y^2) $$\nAccording to Lyapunov's second theorem for stability, if $\\dot{V}$ is negative definite, the origin is asymptotically stable. The term $(x^4+y^4)(x^2+y^2)$ is always positive for any $(x,y) \\neq (0,0)$. Therefore, the sign of $\\dot{V}$ is determined by the sign of $-4\\beta$.\n- For the origin to be asymptotically stable, we require $\\dot{V} < 0$ for all $(x,y) \\neq (0,0)$. This means we need $-4\\beta < 0$, which implies $\\beta > 0$.\n- If $\\beta=0$, then $\\dot{V}=0$. In this case, $V$ is a constant of motion, and the trajectories are the level sets $x^4+y^4=C$. The origin is stable (Lyapunov stable), but not asymptotically stable, as trajectories do not converge to the origin.\n- If $\\beta<0$, then $\\dot{V}>0$ for all $(x,y) \\neq (0,0)$. The origin is unstable.\n\nSo, the condition for asymptotic stability is $\\beta > 0$. Substituting back $\\beta = \\alpha - \\frac{1}{4}$:\n$$ \\alpha - \\frac{1}{4} > 0 \\implies \\alpha > \\frac{1}{4} $$\nThe problem asks for the critical value $\\alpha_c$ such that the system is asymptotically stable for $\\alpha > \\alpha_c$ and not asymptotically stable for $\\alpha \\le \\alpha_c$. Based on our analysis:\n- For $\\alpha > 1/4$, the origin is asymptotically stable.\n- For $\\alpha = 1/4$ (i.e., $\\beta=0$), the origin is stable but not asymptotically stable.\n- For $\\alpha < 1/4$ (i.e., $\\beta<0$), the origin is unstable.\n\nThus, the critical value is $\\alpha_c = 1/4$.\n\nIt is instructive to consider an alternative (but ultimately misleading) analysis in polar coordinates ($x=r\\cos\\theta, y=r\\sin\\theta$) to understand a common pitfall. The rate of change of the radial distance $r=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ is given by $\\dot{r} = (x\\dot{x}+y\\dot{y})/r$. After substitution and simplification, one finds:\n$$ \\dot{r} = -r^3 \\left( \\beta + \\frac{1}{4}\\sin(4\\theta) \\right) $$\nOne might incorrectly assume that for stability, $\\dot{r}$ must be non-positive for all $\\theta$. This would require $\\beta + \\frac{1}{4}\\sin(4\\theta) \\ge 0$ for all $\\theta$, which implies $\\beta \\ge \\max_{\\theta}{(-\\frac{1}{4}\\sin(4\\theta))} = \\frac{1}{4}$. This suggests $\\alpha_c=1/2$, which is incorrect. The reason this reasoning is flawed is that stability does not require the distance from the origin $r(t)$ to be monotonically decreasing. The trajectory can locally move away from the origin ($\\dot{r} > 0$ in some sectors) while still converging to the origin over time. The existence of a valid Lyapunov function whose value strictly decreases along all non-trivial trajectories provides a rigorous proof of asymptotic stability, overriding the potentially misleading interpretation of the sign of $\\dot{r}$. The Lyapunov analysis is the correct path to the solution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$$", "id": "2160262"}]}
