The population can be divided into three groups: susceptible individuals ($S$), infected individuals ($I$), and recovered individuals ($R$). Initially, at time $t=0$, there are 20 infected individuals and no one has recovered yet. The remaining population is susceptible.\n\nThe dynamics of the epidemic are modeled as follows:\n- The rate at which susceptible people become infected is jointly proportional to the number of susceptible people and the number of infected people. The constant of proportionality, known as the effective transmission rate, is $\\alpha = 0.0001 \\text{ (person} \\cdot \\text{day)}^{-1}$.\n- Infected individuals recover at a rate proportional to the number of currently infected people. The constant of proportionality, known as the recovery rate, is $\\gamma = 0.1 \\text{ day}^{-1}$. Once recovered, an individual gains permanent immunity and cannot be reinfected.\n\nCalculate the initial rates of change for the susceptible, infected, and recovered populations ($S'(0)$, $I'(0)$, and $R'(0)$) at time $t=0$. Express your answers as a set of three numerical values in the specified order, in units of people per day.", "solution": "The problem asks for the initial rates of change of the susceptible ($S$), infected ($I$), and recovered ($R$) populations. We are given a description of the dynamics, which we can translate into a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs).\n\nFirst, let's establish the initial conditions at $t=0$.\nThe total population is $N = 2020$.\nThe initial number of infected individuals is $I(0) = 20$.\nThe initial number of recovered individuals is $R(0) = 0$.\nThe number of susceptible individuals is the remainder of the population, so $S(0) = N - I(0) - R(0) = 2020 - 20 - 0 = 2000$.\n\nThe constants given are:\nEffective transmission rate: $\\alpha = 0.0001 \\text{ (person} \\cdot \\text{day)}^{-1}$\nRecovery rate: $\\gamma = 0.1 \\text{ day}^{-1}$\n\nNow, let's write down the differential equations based on the problem description.\nThe rate of change of the susceptible population, $\\frac{dS}{dt}$, is the rate at which susceptible people become infected. The problem states this is proportional to the product $S \\cdot I$ with constant $\\alpha$. Since the number of susceptible people decreases, this rate is negative.\n$$ \\frac{dS}{dt} = -\\alpha S I $$\n\nThe rate of change of the infected population, $\\frac{dI}{dt}$, has two components. It increases as susceptible people get infected and decreases as infected people recover.\nThe rate of increase is $\\alpha S I$.\nThe rate of decrease (recovery) is proportional to $I$ with constant $\\gamma$, so it's $\\gamma I$.\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dt} = \\alpha S I - \\gamma I $$\n\nThe rate of change of the recovered population, $\\frac{dR}{dt}$, is simply the rate at which infected people recover.\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = \\gamma I $$\n\nWe need to find the values of these rates at $t=0$, which are $S'(0)$, $I'(0)$, and $R'(0)$. We can do this by substituting the initial conditions $S(0)$, $I(0)$, and $R(0)$ into the differential equations.\n\nFor the susceptible population:\n$$ S'(0) = \\frac{dS}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} = -\\alpha S(0) I(0) $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ S'(0) = -(0.0001) \\cdot (2000) \\cdot (20) = -(0.0001) \\cdot (40000) = -4 $$\nSo, the susceptible population is initially decreasing at a rate of 4 people per day.\n\nFor the infected population:\n$$ I'(0) = \\frac{dI}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} = \\alpha S(0) I(0) - \\gamma I(0) $$\nWe have already calculated the first term, $\\alpha S(0) I(0) = 4$.\n$$ I'(0) = 4 - \\gamma I(0) = 4 - (0.1) \\cdot (20) = 4 - 2 = 2 $$\nSo, the infected population is initially increasing at a rate of 2 people per day.\n\nFor the recovered population:\n$$ R'(0) = \\frac{dR}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} = \\gamma I(0) $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ R'(0) = (0.1) \\cdot (20) = 2 $$\nSo, the recovered population is initially increasing at a rate of 2 people per day.\n\nThe initial rates of change are $S'(0) = -4$, $I'(0) = 2$, and $R'(0) = 2$, all in units of people per day. As a quick check, note that the total population $N=S+I+R$ is constant, so its rate of change must be zero: $N' = S' + I' + R' = -4 + 2 + 2 = 0$.
