By identifying the equilibrium points and assessing their stability, we can create a qualitative picture of all possible outcomes. This first exercise guides you through this powerful process, demonstrating how the initial state of a system determines its ultimate fate in a model representing population dynamics with an Allee effect.

The population size, denoted by $y(t)$ in millions of cells, is observed to evolve over time $t$ (in hours) according to the autonomous differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dy}{dt} = (y-2)(5-y) $$\nThis model incorporates an Allee effect, where the population declines if it falls below a certain threshold, and a carrying capacity that limits its growth.\nAt the beginning of the experiment ($t=0$), the initial population is measured to be 3 million cells.\nAssuming the model holds for all future times, what is the predicted population of the microorganisms after a very long time? Determine the value of $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y(t)$. Express your answer in millions of cells.", "solution": "We consider the autonomous differential equation $ \\frac{dy}{dt} = f(y)$ with $f(y) = (y-2)(5-y)$ and initial condition $y(0) = 3$. \n\nFirst, we find the equilibrium points by solving $f(y) = 0$. This gives\n$$\n(y-2)(5-y) = 0 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad y = 2 \\text{ or } y = 5.\n$$\nTo determine the stability of these equilibria, we compute $f'(y)$:\n$$\nf'(y) = \\frac{d}{dy}\\big[(y-2)(5-y)\\big] = (1)(5-y) + (y-2)(-1) = 7 - 2y.\n$$\nEvaluating at the equilibria,\n$$\nf'(2) = 7 - 4 = 3 > 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y = 2 \\text{ is unstable},\n$$\n$$\nf'(5) = 7 - 10 = -3 < 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y = 5 \\text{ is asymptotically stable}.\n$$\n\nNext, we analyze the solution trajectory starting from $y(0) = 3$.

Since $y(0) = 3 \\in (2,5)$, the solution initially lies in this interval and increases. The point $y = 5$ is an equilibrium, so $y(t)$ cannot cross it; if it reaches $y = 5$ at some time, uniqueness implies it remains there. Consequently, $y(t)$ is bounded above by $5$ and is monotonically increasing, so by the monotone convergence principle, the limit\n$$\nL = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y(t)\n$$\nexists and satisfies $L \\leq 5$.\n\nBecause $f$ is continuous, any limit $L$ of a solution to an autonomous equation must satisfy $f(L) = 0$, hence $L \\in \\{2,5\\}$.
