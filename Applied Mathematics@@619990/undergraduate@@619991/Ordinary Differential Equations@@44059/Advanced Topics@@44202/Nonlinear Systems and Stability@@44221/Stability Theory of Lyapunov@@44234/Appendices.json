To do this, the student plans to use Lyapunov's direct method. According to this method, a function $V(\\mathbf{x})$ can serve as a candidate Lyapunov function to analyze stability if it is continuous, possesses continuous first partial derivatives, and is positive definite in a neighborhood of the origin.

Therefore $V$ is positive semidefinite, not positive definite.\n\nBy the definition given, this disqualifies $V$ as a Lyapunov function candidate for proving stability via Lyapunov’s direct method, since that method requires positive definiteness to relate level sets of $V$ to neighborhoods of the origin.\n\nFor completeness, its derivative along trajectories is\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x,y)=\\nabla V(x,y)\\cdot \\mathbf{f}(x,y)=\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}f_{1}(x,y)+\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y}f_{2}(x,y)=2x^{3}f_{1}(x,y),\n$$\nand along the $y$-axis (where $x=0$) we get $\\dot{V}(0,y)=0$ regardless of $\\mathbf{f}$.
