Systems of this form are known as conservative systems because mechanical energy is conserved.\n\nLet's demonstrate this by finding a first integral, which is a function $H(x, y)$ that remains constant along the trajectories of the system. If such a function exists, it means $H(x(t), y(t)) = \\text{constant}$ for any solution curve $(x(t), y(t))$. The condition for this is that the total time derivative of $H$ is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dH}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x}\\frac{dx}{dt} + \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y}\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the given system equations:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x}(y) + \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y}(\\alpha x - \\beta x^3) = 0\n$$\nThis is a partial differential equation for $H(x,y)$. A standard way to construct such a function for a system of the form $\\dot{x} = y, \\dot{y} = f(x)$ is to identify it with a Hamiltonian system where $\\dot{x} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y}$ and $\\dot{y} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x}$.\n\nFrom $\\dot{x} = y$, we have $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y} = y$. Integrating this with respect to $y$ gives:\n$$\nH(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2}y^2 + k(x)\n$$\nwhere $k(x)$ is an arbitrary function of $x$.\n\nNext, we use the equation for $\\dot{y}$:\n$$\n\\dot{y} = \\alpha x - \\beta x^3 = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x}\n$$\nSubstituting our expression for $H$:\n$$\n\\alpha x - \\beta x^3 = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}y^2 + k(x)\\right) = -k'(x)\n$$\nThis gives $k'(x) = -(\\alpha x - \\beta x^3) = \\beta x^3 - \\alpha x$.

The first integral, which represents the conserved total energy of the system, is:\n$$\nH(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2}y^2 + \\frac{\\beta}{4}x^4 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}x^2\n$$\nThe trajectories of the system are the level curves of this function, $H(x, y) = C$, where the constant $C$ is determined by the initial conditions.\n\nA limit cycle is defined as an *isolated* periodic trajectory. This means that for a trajectory to be a limit cycle, there must be a neighborhood around it that contains no other periodic trajectories.\n\nIn our system, any periodic trajectory must be a closed level curve of the function $H(x, y)$. The potential energy part, $V(x) = \\frac{\\beta}{4}x^4 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}x^2$, has a \"W\" shape with local minima, implying that for certain ranges of energy $C$, the level curves $H(x,y)=C$ are indeed closed. For example, around the central fixed point at $(0,0)$, there are closed orbits.\n\nHowever, if we have one such closed orbit corresponding to $H(x,y) = C_1$, we can choose a slightly different energy level, $C_2 = C_1 + \\delta C$. For a sufficiently small $\\delta C$, the level curve $H(x,y) = C_2$ will also be a closed orbit lying arbitrarily close to the first one. This means any periodic orbit in the system is part of a continuous family (a continuum) of periodic orbits, parameterized by the energy $C$. No periodic orbit is isolated. Therefore, the system has no limit cycles.\n\nNow we can evaluate the given options:\nA. Almost all trajectories spiral into a stable fixed point. This is incorrect. Conservative systems like this one do not have attractors (stable fixed points or limit cycles). The divergence of the vector field $(\\dot{x}, \\dot{y})$ is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(y) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\alpha x - \\beta x^3) = 0 + 0 = 0$. A non-zero divergence is required for trajectories to spiral.\nB. The system exhibits a single, isolated periodic trajectory (a limit cycle)... This is incorrect. As shown, the system cannot have any isolated periodic trajectories.\nC. The system is characterized by the presence of at least one continuous family of periodic trajectories, and as a consequence, it contains no isolated periodic trajectories (limit cycles). This is correct. The existence of the first integral $H(x,y)$ implies that periodic solutions come in continuous families (the closed level sets of $H$), so none of them can be isolated limit cycles.\nD. For almost all initial conditions, trajectories are unbounded... This is incorrect. The potential energy $V(x) = \\frac{\\beta}{4}x^4 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}x^2$ tends to $+\\infty$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$ (since $\\beta  0$). This means the particle is always trapped in a potential well. Consequently, both $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ (since energy is conserved) must remain bounded for all time. All trajectories are bounded.\nE. The system has exactly two stable limit cycles... This is incorrect. The system has no limit cycles.\n\nTherefore, the only correct statement is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2183586"}]}
