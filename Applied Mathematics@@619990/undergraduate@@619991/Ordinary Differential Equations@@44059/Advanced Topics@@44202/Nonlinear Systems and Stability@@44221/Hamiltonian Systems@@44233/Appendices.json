The Hamiltonian is given by $H(q, p) = \\frac{1}{2}p^2 + \\frac{1}{4}q^4 - \\frac{1}{2}q^2$.\n\nThe equations of motion are $\\dot{q} = \\frac{dq}{dt}$ and $\\dot{p} = \\frac{dp}{dt}$.\nWe compute the partial derivatives of the Hamiltonian:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}p^2 + \\frac{1}{4}q^4 - \\frac{1}{2}q^2 \\right) = p $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}p^2 + \\frac{1}{4}q^4 - \\frac{1}{2}q^2 \\right) = q^3 - q $$\n\nSubstituting these into Hamilton's equations gives the system of differential equations:\n$$ \\dot{q} = p $$\n$$ \\dot{p} = -(q^3 - q) = q - q^3 $$\n\nEquilibrium points $(q_0, p_0)$ are found by setting $\\dot{q} = 0$ and $\\dot{p} = 0$.\nFrom $\\dot{q} = 0$, we have $p_0 = 0$.\nFrom $\\dot{p} = 0$, we have $q_0 - q_0^3 = 0$. This can be factored as $q_0(1 - q_0^2) = 0$, or $q_0(1 - q_0)(1 + q_0) = 0$.\nThe solutions for $q_0$ are $q_0 = 0$, $q_0 = 1$, and $q_0 = -1$.\nCombining these with $p_0=0$, we find three equilibrium points: $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(-1, 0)$.\n\nNext, we classify these equilibrium points by analyzing the linearization of the system around each point. We compute the Jacobian matrix of the vector field $F(q, p) = (\\dot{q}, \\dot{p}) = (p, q - q^3)$.\n$$ J(q, p) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial \\dot{q}}{\\partial q} & \\frac{\\partial \\dot{q}}{\\partial p} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\dot{p}}{\\partial q} & \\frac{\\partial \\dot{p}}{\\partial p} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}(p) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}(p) \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}(q - q^3) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}(q - q^3) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 - 3q^2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nNow, we evaluate this Jacobian at each equilibrium point and find the eigenvalues.\n\nCase 1: Equilibrium point $(0, 0)$\n$$ J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 - 3(0)^2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe characteristic equation is $\\det(J - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -\\lambda & 1 \\\\ 1 & -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (-\\lambda)(-\\lambda) - (1)(1) = \\lambda^2 - 1 = 0 $$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -1$. Since we have one positive and one negative real eigenvalue, the equilibrium point $(0, 0)$ is an unstable saddle point.\n\nCase 2: Equilibrium point $(1, 0)$\n$$ J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 - 3(1)^2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe characteristic equation is:\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -\\lambda & 1 \\\\ -2 & -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (-\\lambda)(-\\lambda) - (1)(-2) = \\lambda^2 + 2 = 0 $$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda^2 = -2$, so $\\lambda_{1,2} = \\pm i\\sqrt{2}$. Since the eigenvalues are purely imaginary and non-zero, the equilibrium point $(1, 0)$ is a center. From linear stability theory, a center is stable.\n\nCase 3: Equilibrium point $(-1, 0)$\n$$ J(-1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 - 3(-1)^2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis is the same Jacobian matrix as for the point $(1, 0)$.
