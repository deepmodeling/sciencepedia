The boundary layer serves to connect the \"outer solution\" (the approximate solution away from the layer) to the boundary condition that the outer solution cannot satisfy.\n\nThe outer solution, let's call it $y_0(x)$, is found by setting $\\epsilon = 0$ in the original equation.

The fact that $p(x)=0$ at the endpoints $x=0$ and $x=1$ does not change the fact that $p(x)$ is consistently negative throughout the interior of the domain.\n\nSince $p(x) < 0$ on the interval $(0,1)$, the boundary layer must be located at the right endpoint of the domain.
