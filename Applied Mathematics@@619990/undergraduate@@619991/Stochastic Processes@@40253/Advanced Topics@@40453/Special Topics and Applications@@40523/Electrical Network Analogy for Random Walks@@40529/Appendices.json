By calculating the hitting probability, you will see how it naturally corresponds to the voltage at a node between two terminals set at different potentials, a key principle that underpins this entire topic [@problem_id:1299098].", "problem": "A particle performs a random walk on a simple graph consisting of three vertices: $A$, $B$, and $C$. The vertices are connected in a line such that vertex $B$ is connected to both $A$ and $C$, but $A$ and $C$ are not directly connected to each other. The random walk is defined by transition probabilities proportional to the weight of the edges. The weight of the edge between vertices $A$ and $B$ is given as $w_{AB}$, and the weight of the edge between vertices $B$ and $C$ is $w_{BC}$. It is known that $w_{AB} = 2w_{BC}$. The vertices $A$ and $C$ act as absorbing boundaries.

In many real-world processes, states can merge or become indistinguishable; this practice demonstrates how to represent such a change by physically modifying the electrical network. You will see how to model this by merging nodes and precisely quantify the impact by calculating the resulting shift in the network's effective resistance [@problem_id:1299152].", "problem": "In the study of random walks on graphs, an electrical network analogy is a powerful tool. The probability of moving between connected states can be related to the conductance of an edge in an equivalent electrical circuit. Consider a system whose state space is modeled by a graph with four nodes: A, B, C, and D. The connections are represented by edges between the following pairs of nodes: (A, B), (B, C), (C, D), (D, A), and (A, C). Each edge in this network corresponds to a resistor with a resistance of $R_0 = 1.0 \\Omega$.\n\nInitially, we are interested in the effective resistance between nodes A and B, which we denote as $R_{initial}$.\n\nSubsequently, the system undergoes a modification where states C and D become indistinguishable. In the electrical network analogy, this is modeled by merging nodes C and D into a single new node, which we will call K. This merging operation implies that any edge that was previously connected to either C or D is now connected to node K.\n\nCalculate the change in the effective resistance between nodes A and B after this modification.

Consider a simplified model of such a network consisting of $n$ nodes, where $n \\geq 2$. The connection between any pair of distinct nodes is a resistive link, and every link in the network has the same electrical resistance $R$.\n\nYour task is to determine the effective electrical resistance between any two arbitrarily chosen distinct nodes in this network. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $n$ and $R$.", "solution": "Let the set of $n$ nodes be $V = \\{v_1, v_2, ..., v_n\\}$. We want to find the effective resistance, $R_{eff}$, between two arbitrary distinct nodes, let's call them $A$ and $B$. Without loss of generality, let $A = v_1$ and $B = v_2$.\n\nTo find the effective resistance, we can connect an ideal voltage source with voltage $V_0$ across nodes $A$ and $B$. The total current $I$ that flows from the source into node $A$ and out of node $B$ is related to $R_{eff}$ by Ohm's law: $R_{eff} = \\frac{V_0}{I}$.\n\nLet's set the electric potential at node $A$ to be $V_A$ and at node $B$ to be $V_B$. The potential difference is $V_0 = V_A - V_B$. Due to the symmetry of the network, we can choose a convenient potential reference. Let's set the potentials such that $V_A = \\frac{V_0}{2}$ and $V_B = -\\frac{V_0}{2}$.\n\nNow consider the remaining $n-2$ nodes, $\\{v_3, v_4, ..., v_n\\}$. Let's call this set $S$. Each node $v_k \\in S$ is connected to node $A$ by a resistor $R$ and to node $B$ by a resistor $R$. For any node $v_k \\in S$, its position in the network is completely symmetric with respect to nodes $A$ and $B$. The potential at any node $v_k$ must be the same due to this symmetry. The potential at these nodes must be exactly halfway between $V_A$ and $V_B$ if we only considered the sub-circuit of $A$, $B$, and $v_k$. By superposition and symmetry over all nodes, we can argue that the potential of all nodes in $S$ must be 0. Let's denote the potential of any node in $S$ as $V_S$. So, $V_S = 0$.\n\nOur goal is to find the total current $I$ entering node $A$. We can use Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at node $A$.
