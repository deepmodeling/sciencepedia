This skill is fundamental to constructing and simulating any stochastic epidemic model [@problem_id:1281962].", "problem": "A wildlife biologist is studying a non-lethal disease spreading through an isolated population of amphibians. The dynamics of the disease are modeled using a stochastic Susceptible-Infective-Susceptible (SIS) model, which also accounts for demographic changes in the population. In this model, individuals can be in one of two states: Susceptible (S) or Infective (I). Infective individuals can recover and become susceptible again, as the disease does not confer immunity.\n\nThe state of the system at any time $t$ is described by a pair of integers $(I(t), N(t))$, where $I(t)$ is the number of infective individuals and $N(t)$ is the total population size. The number of susceptible individuals is therefore $S(t) = N(t) - I(t)$.\n\nThe population dynamics are governed by the following continuous-time stochastic processes:\n1.  **Birth**: New individuals are born susceptible at a constant rate $\\Lambda$.\n2.  **Death**: All individuals, whether susceptible or infective, have a per capita natural death rate of $\\mu$.\n3.  **Infection**: A susceptible individual becomes infective through contact with an infective individual.

To model behavioral changes such as social distancing or \"infection fatigue,\" the total rate of new infections in the population is not a simple mass-action term. Instead, it is given by a saturated form:\n    $$\n    \\text{Rate of Infection} = \\frac{\\beta S I}{K+I}\n    $$\n    where $S$ is the number of susceptible individuals, $I$ is the number of infected individuals, $\\beta$ is a transmission coefficient, and $K$ is a positive saturation constant.\n2.  **Recovery:** Infected individuals recover and gain permanent immunity at a constant per-capita rate $\\gamma$.
