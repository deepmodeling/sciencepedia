By considering a familiar system—a library—this exercise allows you to solidify your understanding of the relationship between arrival rate ($\\lambda$), average time in the system ($W$), and the average number of items in the system ($L$). Solving this problem will build your intuition for how these three key metrics are fundamentally linked in any stable process [@problem_id:1315284].", "problem": "The management of the Stochastic University Library is conducting an analysis of its circulation data to better understand its collection's usage and plan for future acquisitions. Through long-term observation, they have determined that, on average, 250 books are borrowed by students and faculty each day the library is open. The library's policy sets a standard loan period, and internal records show that the average time a book remains checked out is exactly 28 days.\n\nAssuming the system of borrowed books is in a steady state, what is the average number of books that are checked out from the library at any given moment?", "solution": "This problem can be analyzed using Little's Law, a fundamental theorem in queuing theory that relates key variables in a stable system.\n\nLittle's Law is stated as:\n$$L = \\lambda W$$\n\nWhere:\n- $L$ is the average number of items within the system.\n- $\\lambda$ is the average arrival rate of items into the system.\n- $W$ is the average time an item spends in the system.\n\nWe can map the components of the library scenario to these variables:\n\n1.  **The System**: The \"system\" in this context is the collection of all books that are currently checked out and on loan from the library.\n\n2.  **Average Arrival Rate ($\\lambda$)**: This corresponds to the rate at which books are borrowed. The problem states that, on average, 250 books are borrowed per day.\n    $$ \\lambda = 250 \\text{ books/day} $$\n\n3.  **Average Time in System ($W$)**: This is the average duration a book stays in the \"checked out\" state. The problem gives this as the average loan period, which is 28 days.\n    $$ W = 28 \\text{ days} $$\n\n4.  **Average Number in System ($L$)**: This is the quantity we want to find—the average number of books that are on loan at any given time.\n\nBefore applying the formula, it is crucial to ensure the units are consistent. The arrival rate $\\lambda$ is in books per day, and the time $W$ is in days. The product $\\lambda W$ will result in a dimensionless quantity representing the number of books, which is what is required.\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into Little's Law:\n$$ L = \\lambda \\times W $$\n$$ L = (250 \\text{ books/day}) \\times (28 \\text{ days}) $$\n$$ L = 7000 \\text{ books} $$\n\nTherefore, the average number of books checked out from the library at any given moment is 7000.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7000}$$", "id": "1315284"}, {"introduction": "Having practiced calculating the average system size, we now explore the versatility of Little's Law by using it as a diagnostic tool.

This scenario [@problem_id:1341721], set in a modern e-commerce context, highlights how Little's Law can be used to infer system throughput and emphasizes the critical importance of ensuring consistent units in your calculations.", "problem": "A boutique e-commerce platform uses a single, dedicated server to process incoming purchase orders. System administrators are monitoring the server's performance to plan for future capacity upgrades. Through extensive logging, they have determined that, on average, there are 5.75 orders present in the system at any given moment. This count includes the order currently being processed by the server as well as any orders waiting in the queue. Furthermore, the total time an order spends in the system, from the moment it is submitted until its processing is complete, has an average value of 115 milliseconds. Assuming the system can be modeled as a stable M/M/1 queue, calculate the average arrival rate of orders. Express your answer in orders per second, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires us to find the average arrival rate of orders, denoted by $\\lambda$. We are given the average number of orders in the system, $L$, and the average time an order spends in the system, $W$. The relationship between these quantities in a stable queuing system is described by Little's Law.\n\nLittle's Law is stated as:\n$$L = \\lambda W$$\nwhere:\n- $L$ is the average number of customers (or orders, in this case) in the system.\n- $\\lambda$ is the average arrival rate of customers.\n- $W$ is the average time a customer spends in the system.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n- $L = 5.75$ orders\n- $W = 115$ milliseconds\n\nThe problem asks for the arrival rate $\\lambda$ in units of orders per second.

Instead of viewing the system as a single 'black box', you will analyze a closed-loop system composed of distinct zones and travel paths. The key to solving this problem [@problem_id:1315287] is the powerful technique of system decomposition: applying Little's Law not just to the system as a whole, but also to its individual components, demonstrating how to untangle complex processes to find specific performance metrics.", "problem": "A large automated warehouse employs a fleet of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) to transport goods from a designated loading zone to a separate unloading zone. The AGVs operate continuously on a closed, one-way loop track that connects these two zones. The system has reached a steady state of operation.\n\nThe following quantities have been determined through long-term observation:\n- The total number of AGVs operating in the closed loop is a constant, $N$.\n- The system throughput, defined as the average rate at which AGVs complete a full cycle, is measured to be $\\lambda$.\n- The time-averaged number of AGVs physically present within the boundaries of the loading zone (including those waiting for service or actively being loaded) is $L_L$.\n- The time-averaged number of AGVs physically present within the boundaries of the unloading zone (including those waiting for service or actively being unloaded) is $L_U$.\n\nBased solely on this information, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the average total travel time, $T_{travel}$, for a single AGV to complete one full cycle of travel. This travel time is defined as the time spent on the track moving from the loading zone to the unloading zone, plus the time spent on the track returning from the unloading zone to the loading zone.", "solution": "We model the closed-loop AGV system in steady state and apply Little’s Law, which states that for any stable subsystem, the long-run time-average number in the system equals the long-run average arrival rate times the average time in the system. Symbolically, for any subsystem, $L=\\lambda W$, where $L$ is the time-averaged number in the subsystem, $\\lambda$ is the steady throughput through that subsystem, and $W$ is the average time an entity spends in that subsystem.\n\nFirst, apply Little’s Law to the entire closed loop (loading zone, track, unloading zone). Let $T_{\\text{cycle}}$ denote the average total cycle time per AGV. Since the total average number of AGVs in the loop is $N$ and the throughput is $\\lambda$, we have\n$$\nN=\\lambda T_{\\text{cycle}} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad T_{\\text{cycle}}=\\frac{N}{\\lambda}.\n$$\n\nNext, apply Little’s Law to the loading zone. Let $T_{L}$ denote the average time an AGV spends in the loading zone. Given the time-averaged number in the loading zone $L_{L}$ and the same throughput $\\lambda$, we have\n$$\nL_{L}=\\lambda T_{L} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad T_{L}=\\frac{L_{L}}{\\lambda}.\n$$\n\nSimilarly, apply Little’s Law to the unloading zone. Let $T_{U}$ denote the average time an AGV spends in the unloading zone. With the time-averaged number in the unloading zone $L_{U}$, we obtain\n$$\nL_{U}=\\lambda T_{U} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad T_{U}=\\frac{L_{U}}{\\lambda}.\n$$\n\nBy definition, the total cycle time decomposes into the sum of the average time in the loading zone, the average total travel time on the track (from loading to unloading and back), and the average time in the unloading zone:\n$$\nT_{\\text{cycle}}=T_{L}+T_{\\text{travel}}+T_{U}.\n$$\nSolving for the desired average total travel time $T_{\\text{travel}}$ and substituting the expressions above gives\n$$\nT_{\\text{travel}}=T_{\\text{cycle}}-T_{L}-T_{U}=\\frac{N}{\\lambda}-\\frac{L_{L}}{\\lambda}-\\frac{L_{U}}{\\lambda}=\\frac{N-L_{L}-L_{U}}{\\lambda}.\n$$\n\nEquivalently, one can view the track as a subsystem whose time-averaged population is $N-L_{L}-L_{U}$; applying Little’s Law directly to the track yields the same result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{N-L_{L}-L_{U}}{\\lambda}}$$", "id": "1315287"}]}
