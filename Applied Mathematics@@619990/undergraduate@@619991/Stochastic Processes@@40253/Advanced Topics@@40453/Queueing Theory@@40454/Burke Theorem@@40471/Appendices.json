We can model the situation as an M/M/1 queue. The notation M/M/1 stands for:\n- The first 'M' (for Markovian or memoryless) indicates that the arrivals follow a Poisson process. The rate of this arrival process is given as $\\lambda$.\n- The second 'M' indicates that the service times are exponentially distributed. The rate of service is given as $\\mu$, which is the reciprocal of the mean service time ($1/\\mu$).\n- The '1' indicates that there is a single server (the single toll booth).\n\nThe problem states that the system is in a steady state, which requires the condition $\\lambda  \\mu$. This means that, on average, vehicles arrive slower than they can be served, preventing the queue from growing infinitely long.\n\nThe question asks for the rate of the departure process. The problem statement explicitly mentions that Burke's theorem applies. Burke's theorem is a key result in queueing theory that deals with the output of certain queueing systems.\n\nFor an M/M/c queue (where c is the number of servers) in steady-state with arrival rate $\\lambda$ and service rate $\\mu$ per server, satisfying the stability condition $\\lambda  c\\mu$, Burke's theorem states that the departure process is also a Poisson process with a rate equal to the arrival rate, $\\lambda$.\n\nIn our specific case, we have an M/M/1 queue, so $c=1$. The arrival rate is $\\lambda$. The problem states the system is in steady-state, so the condition $\\lambda  1 \\cdot \\mu$ is met. According to Burke's theorem, the departure process must be a Poisson process with a rate exactly equal to the arrival rate.\n\nThis can be understood intuitively as a conservation of flow. In a stable, steady-state system, the long-term average rate at which entities enter the system must equal the long-term average rate at which they leave. If the departure rate were different from the arrival rate, the number of entities in the system would either be constantly increasing (if arrival rate  departure rate) or decreasing towards zero (if arrival rate  departure rate), which contradicts the notion of a non-empty steady state.\n\nTherefore, the rate of the departure Poisson process is $\\lambda$.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA. $\\lambda$ - This matches our conclusion.\nB. $\\mu$ - This is the service rate.\nC. $\\mu - \\lambda$ - This is related to the \"idle rate\" of the server.\nD. $\\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu}$ - This is the traffic intensity or server utilization, often denoted by $\\rho$.\nE. $\\frac{\\lambda \\mu}{\\lambda + \\mu}$ - This form often appears in different contexts, like parallel processes, but is not the departure rate here.\n\nThe correct option is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1286987"}, {"introduction": "Having established the nature of the departure process, we now delve deeper into the system's internal state.
