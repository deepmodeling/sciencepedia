By comparing two systems with identical arrival rates and mean service times—one with constant, predictable service (an M/D/1 queue) and another with highly variable, exponential service (an M/M/1 queue)—we can directly quantify how consistency reduces waiting times. This practice demonstrates why minimizing unpredictability is as crucial as increasing average speed in system design.
