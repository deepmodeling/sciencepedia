The 'M's stand for Markovian (or memoryless), indicating that both the inter-arrival times and the service times are exponentially distributed. The '1' signifies that there is a single server.\n\nFirst, we need to establish consistent units for the rates and times. The problem gives the arrival rate in jobs per hour and the maximum waiting time in seconds, but asks for the final service rate in jobs per minute. Let's convert everything to minutes.\n\nThe arrival rate, denoted by $\\lambda$, is given as 144 jobs per hour.\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{144 \\text{ jobs}}{1 \\text{ hour}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ hour}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} = 2.4 \\text{ jobs/minute} $$\n\nThe maximum allowed average waiting time in the queue, which we will call $W_{q, \\text{max}}$, is 45 seconds.\n$$ W_{q, \\text{max}} = 45 \\text{ seconds} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ minute}}{60 \\text{ seconds}} = 0.75 \\text{ minutes} $$\n\nLet $\\mu$ be the service rate in jobs per minute, which is the quantity we need to find. For a steady-state M/M/1 queue, the average waiting time in the queue, $W_q$, is given by the formula:\n$$ W_q = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu(\\mu - \\lambda)} $$\nThis formula is valid only for a stable system, which requires the service rate to be greater than the arrival rate, i.e., $\\mu > \\lambda$.\n\nWe are given the condition that the average waiting time must not exceed $W_{q, \\text{max}}$. This translates to the inequality:\n$$ W_q \\le W_{q, \\text{max}} $$\nSubstituting the formula for $W_q$:\n$$ \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu(\\mu - \\lambda)} \\le W_{q, \\text{max}} $$\n\nNow, substitute the numerical values for $\\lambda$ and $W_{q, \\text{max}}$:\n$$ \\frac{2.4}{\\mu(\\mu - 2.4)} \\le 0.75 $$\n\nTo solve this inequality for $\\mu$, we first consider the stability condition $\\mu > \\lambda = 2.4$. In this case, both $\\mu$ and $(\\mu - 2.4)$ are positive, so their product $\\mu(\\mu - 2.4)$ is also positive. We can multiply both sides of the inequality by this product without changing the direction of the inequality sign:\n$$ 2.4 \\le 0.75 \\mu (\\mu - 2.4) $$\n$$ 2.4 \\le 0.75 \\mu^2 - (0.75)(2.4) \\mu $$\n$$ 2.4 \\le 0.75 \\mu^2 - 1.8 \\mu $$\n\nTo simplify, we can divide the entire inequality by 0.75 (or multiply by 4/3):\n$$ \\frac{2.4}{0.75} \\le \\mu^2 - \\frac{1.8}{0.75} \\mu $$\n$$ 3.2 \\le \\mu^2 - 2.4 \\mu $$\n\nRearranging this into a standard quadratic inequality form:\n$$ \\mu^2 - 2.4 \\mu - 3.2 \\ge 0 $$\n\nTo find when this inequality holds, we first find the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation $\\mu^2 - 2.4 \\mu - 3.2 = 0$ using the quadratic formula, $\\mu = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$ \\mu = \\frac{-(-2.4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2.4)^2 - 4(1)(-3.2)}}{2(1)} $$\n$$ \\mu = \\frac{2.4 \\pm \\sqrt{5.76 + 12.8}}{2} $$\n$$ \\mu = \\frac{2.4 \\pm \\sqrt{18.56}}{2} $$\n\nNow, we calculate the two roots:\n$$ \\mu_1 = \\frac{2.4 - \\sqrt{18.56}}{2} \\approx \\frac{2.4 - 4.3081}{2} \\approx -0.95405 $$\n$$ \\mu_2 = \\frac{2.4 + \\sqrt{18.56}}{2} \\approx \\frac{2.4 + 4.3081}{2} \\approx 3.35405 $$\n\nThe quadratic function $f(\\mu) = \\mu^2 - 2.4 \\mu - 3.2$ represents a parabola opening upwards.

This corresponds to the lower bound of the valid range for $\\mu$.\nTherefore, the minimum required service rate is $\\mu_{\\text{min}} = 3.35405$ jobs/minute.\n\nThe problem asks to round the final answer to three significant figures.\nThe first three significant figures of 3.35405 are 3, 3, and 5.
