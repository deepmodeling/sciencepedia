Let Station 1 be the Initial Processing Unit and Station 2 be the Secondary Verification Unit. We need to find the expected number of jobs in Station 2, denoted as $L_2$.\n\nFirst, we must express all rates in consistent units. We will use jobs per minute.\n\nThe external arrival rate to the system is given as $\\gamma = 8$ jobs per minute. All these arrivals are directed to Station 1. Thus, the external arrival rate to Station 1 is $\\gamma_1 = 8$ jobs/min, and the external arrival rate to Station 2 is $\\gamma_2 = 0$.\n\nNext, we calculate the service rates for each station. The service rate $\\mu$ is the reciprocal of the mean service time.\n\nFor Station 1, the mean service time is 5 seconds. We convert this to minutes:\nMean service time at Station 1 = $5 \\text{ seconds} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ minute}}{60 \\text{ seconds}} = \\frac{5}{60} \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{1}{12}$ minutes.\nThe service rate for Station 1 is therefore:\n$\\mu_1 = \\frac{1}{1/12 \\text{ minutes/job}} = 12$ jobs/min.\n\nFor Station 2, the mean service time is 12 seconds.
