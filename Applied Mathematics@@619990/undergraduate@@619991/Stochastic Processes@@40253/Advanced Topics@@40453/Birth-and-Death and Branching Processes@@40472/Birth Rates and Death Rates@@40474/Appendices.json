The state of the machine can be modeled as a continuous-time stochastic process. When the machine is in a 'working' state, it can break down.

The total time it spends in this non-operational state before becoming 'working' again is an exponential random variable with rate parameter $\\beta$.\n\nDetermine the long-run availability of this machine.

This implies that the sequence of birth times can be constructed from i.i.d. interarrival times that are exponential with parameter $\\lambda$. Equivalently, the birth counting process $N_{\\text{birth}}(t)$ is a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda$, so for any finite $t$,\n$$\nN_{\\text{birth}}(t)\\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda t),\n$$\nand in particular $N_{\\text{birth}}(t)$ is almost surely finite.\n\nLet $X(t)$ denote the population size at time $t$.

Since $X(0)$ is finite and $N_{\\text{birth}}(t)$ is almost surely finite for every finite $t$, it follows that $N_{\\text{death}}(t)$ is also almost surely finite for every finite $t$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of jumps (births plus deaths) by any finite time $t$,\n$$\nJ(t) = N_{\\text{birth}}(t)+N_{\\text{death}}(t),\n$$\nis almost surely finite.
