This shows that $\\mu(x)$ is globally Lipschitz with a Lipschitz constant $L_1 = 1$.\n\n2.  **Growth Condition for $\\mu(x)$:**\n    The function is $|\\mu(x)| = \\frac{1}{1+|x|}$. Since $|x| \\ge 0$, the denominator $1+|x| \\ge 1$. Thus, we have $0  |\\mu(x)| \\leq 1$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    Since $\\mu(x)$ is a bounded function, it automatically satisfies the linear growth condition. To be explicit, $|\\mu(x)|^2 \\le 1^2 = 1$. We need to find a constant $C_1$ such that $1 \\leq C_1(1+x^2)$. Choosing $C_1=1$ works, since $1 \\leq 1+x^2$ for all $x$.\n\n**Analysis of the diffusion coefficient $\\sigma(x) = \\frac{x}{1+x^2}$:**\n\n1.  **Lipschitz Condition for $\\sigma(x)$:**\n    A differentiable function is globally Lipschitz if its derivative is bounded. Let's find the derivative of $\\sigma(x)$:\n    $$ \\sigma'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{x}{1+x^2}\\right) = \\frac{(1)(1+x^2) - x(2x)}{(1+x^2)^2} = \\frac{1-x^2}{(1+x^2)^2} $$\n    To check if the derivative is bounded, we can find its maximum absolute value. Let's find an upper bound for $|\\sigma'(x)|$:\n    $$ |\\sigma'(x)| = \\frac{|1-x^2|}{(1+x^2)^2} \\leq \\frac{1+x^2}{(1+x^2)^2} = \\frac{1}{1+x^2} $$\n    Since $1+x^2 \\ge 1$, we have $\\frac{1}{1+x^2} \\le 1$.\n    So, we have shown that $|\\sigma'(x)| \\leq 1$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    By the Mean Value Theorem, for any $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, there exists a $c$ between $x$ and $y$ such that $\\sigma(x) - \\sigma(y) = \\sigma'(c)(x-y)$.\n    Taking the absolute value, we get $|\\sigma(x) - \\sigma(y)| = |\\sigma'(c)||x-y| \\leq 1 \\cdot |x-y|$.\n    This shows that $\\sigma(x)$ is globally Lipschitz with a Lipschitz constant $L_2 = 1$.\n\n2.  **Growth Condition for $\\sigma(x)$:**\n    We analyze the magnitude of $\\sigma(x)$: $|\\sigma(x)| = \\frac{|x|}{1+x^2}$.\n    To find the maximum value, we can examine its derivative, which we already found to be zero at $x=\\pm 1$. At these points, $|\\sigma(\\pm 1)| = \\frac{1}{1+1} = \\frac{1}{2}$. As $|x|\\to\\infty$, $|\\sigma(x)|\\to 0$. At $x=0$, $\\sigma(0)=0$.\n    Thus, the function is bounded: $|\\sigma(x)| \\le \\frac{1}{2}$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    Since $\\sigma(x)$ is bounded, it satisfies the linear growth condition. Specifically, $|\\sigma(x)|^2 \\le (\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$. We need to find a constant $C_2$ such that $\\frac{1}{4} \\leq C_2(1+x^2)$. Choosing $C_2=1/4$ works, since $1/4 \\le (1/4)(1+x^2)$ for all $x$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth the drift coefficient $\\mu(x)$ and the diffusion coefficient $\\sigma(x)$ are globally Lipschitz.\nBoth coefficients are also bounded, which is a stronger condition than and implies the linear growth condition.\nTherefore, the statement that correctly describes the properties is that both coefficients individually satisfy a global Lipschitz condition and are bounded.
