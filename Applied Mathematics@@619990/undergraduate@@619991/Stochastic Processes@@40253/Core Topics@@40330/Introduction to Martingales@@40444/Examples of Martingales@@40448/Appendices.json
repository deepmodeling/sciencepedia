This technique is fundamental in stochastic analysis for managing the quadratic variation of processes.", "id": "1299933", "problem": "A quantitative analyst is developing a simple model for a speculative asset. The model assumes the asset's price starts at zero, so $S_0 = 0$. At the end of each day $i$, the price changes by an amount $X_i$. The total price at the end of day $n$ is given by the sum of these daily changes, $S_n = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$. The daily changes $X_1, X_2, \\ldots$ are independent and identically distributed random variables. The market is assumed to be unbiased, meaning the expected daily change is zero, $E[X_i] = 0$. The daily volatility is constant, with the variance of the daily change being $\\text{Var}(X_i) = \\sigma^2$, where $\\sigma^2$ is a positive constant.\n\nThe analyst considers a derivative instrument whose value at the end of day $n$ is given by $V_n = S_n^2 - cn$, where $c$ is a constant daily fee. The analyst wants to set the fee $c$ to make the instrument a \"fair game\". A fair game is defined by the property that the expected value of the instrument tomorrow, given all information up to and including today, is equal to its value today. Mathematically, this condition is expressed as $E[V_{n+1} \\mid S_0, S_1, \\dots, S_n] = V_n$ for all $n \\ge 0$.\n\nDetermine the value of the constant fee $c$ that makes this instrument a fair game.

Let the information available at time $n$, represented by the history $(S_0, S_1, \\dots, S_n)$, be denoted by $\\mathcal{F}_n$. The condition can be written as $E[V_{n+1} \\mid \\mathcal{F}_n] = V_n$.\n\nWe start by expressing $V_{n+1}$ in terms of quantities at time $n$ and the new random change $X_{n+1}$.\nBy definition, $V_{n+1} = S_{n+1}^2 - c(n+1)$.\nThe price at time $n+1$ is $S_{n+1} = S_n + X_{n+1}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $V_{n+1}$:\n$$V_{n+1} = (S_n + X_{n+1})^2 - c(n+1)$$\nExpanding the squared term:\n$$V_{n+1} = S_n^2 + 2S_n X_{n+1} + X_{n+1}^2 - c(n+1)$$\n\nNow, we take the conditional expectation of $V_{n+1}$ with respect to the information $\\mathcal{F}_n$:\n$$E[V_{n+1} \\mid \\mathcal{F}_n] = E[S_n^2 + 2S_n X_{n+1} + X_{n+1}^2 - c(n+1) \\mid \\mathcal{F}_n]$$\n\nUsing the linearity of conditional expectation, we can break this down into several terms:\n$$E[V_{n+1} \\mid \\mathcal{F}_n] = E[S_n^2 \\mid \\mathcal{F}_n] + E[2S_n X_{n+1} \\mid \\mathcal{F}_n] + E[X_{n+1}^2 \\mid \\mathcal{F}_n] - E[c(n+1) \\mid \\mathcal{F}_n]$$\n\nLet's evaluate each term:\n1.  $S_n$ is known at time $n$, so it is $\\mathcal{F}_n$-measurable. This means $E[S_n^2 \\mid \\mathcal{F}_n] = S_n^2$. Similarly, the constant term $c(n+1)$ is also known, so $E[c(n+1) \\mid \\mathcal{F}_n] = c(n+1)$.\n\n2.  For the term $E[2S_n X_{n+1} \\mid \\mathcal{F}_n]$, we can take the known factor $2S_n$ out of the conditional expectation (\"taking out what is known\"):\n    $$E[2S_n X_{n+1} \\mid \\mathcal{F}_n] = 2S_n E[X_{n+1} \\mid \\mathcal{F}_n]$$\n    Since the random variable $X_{n+1}$ is independent of the past history $\\mathcal{F}_n$, its conditional expectation is just its unconditional expectation: $E[X_{n+1} \\mid \\mathcal{F}_n] = E[X_{n+1}]$.\n    The problem states that $E[X_i] = 0$ for all $i$. Thus, $E[X_{n+1}] = 0$.\n    So, this term becomes $2S_n \\times 0 = 0$.\n\n3.  For the term $E[X_{n+1}^2 \\mid \\mathcal{F}_n]$, since $X_{n+1}$ is independent of $\\mathcal{F}_n$, we have $E[X_{n+1}^2 \\mid \\mathcal{F}_n] = E[X_{n+1}^2]$.\n    We are given the variance $\\text{Var}(X_{n+1}) = \\sigma^2$ and the mean $E[X_{n+1}] = 0$. The variance is defined as $\\text{Var}(X_{n+1}) = E[X_{n+1}^2] - (E[X_{n+1}])^2$.\n    Substituting the known values:\n    $$\\sigma^2 = E[X_{n+1}^2] - (0)^2$$\n    Therefore, $E[X_{n+1}^2] = \\sigma^2$.\n\nSubstituting these results back into the equation for $E[V_{n+1} \\mid \\mathcal{F}_n]$:\n$$E[V_{n+1} \\mid \\mathcal{F}_n] = S_n^2 + 0 + \\sigma^2 - c(n+1)$$\n$$E[V_{n+1} \\mid \\mathcal{F}_n] = S_n^2 + \\sigma^2 - cn - c$$\n\nNow we apply the fair game condition, $E[V_{n+1} \\mid \\mathcal{F}_n] = V_n$. We know that $V_n = S_n^2 - cn$.\nSetting the two expressions equal:\n$$S_n^2 + \\sigma^2 - cn - c = S_n^2 - cn$$\n\nWe can cancel the $S_n^2$ and $-cn$ terms from both sides of the equation:\n$$\\sigma^2 - c = 0$$\nSolving for $c$, we get:\n$$c = \\sigma^2$$\n\nThus, the daily fee $c$ must be equal to the variance of the daily price change, $\\sigma^2$, for the instrument to be a fair game.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sigma^{2}}$$"}, {"introduction": "Shifting from additive to multiplicative processes, this problem [@problem_id:1299939] introduces a scenario common in modeling asset prices or population growth, where changes are proportional rather than absolute.
