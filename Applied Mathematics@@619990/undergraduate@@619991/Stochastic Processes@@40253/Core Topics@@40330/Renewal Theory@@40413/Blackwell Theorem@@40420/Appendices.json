Upon completion of one task, the next one begins instantaneously. The time required to complete a single task is a random variable, measured in discrete time units. Specifically, the duration $T$ of any given task is given by the formula $T = 2K$, where $K$ is a random integer drawn from a geometric distribution with success probability $p \\in (0, 1)$, defined by the probability mass function $P(K=k) = (1-p)^{k-1}p$ for $k = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$.
