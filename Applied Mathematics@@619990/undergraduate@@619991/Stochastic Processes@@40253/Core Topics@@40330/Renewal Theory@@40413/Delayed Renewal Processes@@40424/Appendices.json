The lifetime of a standard component, denoted by the random variable $X$, is governed by a continuous probability distribution with Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) $F(x)$. These lifetimes are independent and identically distributed with a finite mean $E[X] = \\mu$ and a finite, non-zero variance $\\text{Var}(X) = \\sigma^2$.\n\nTo optimize system stability from the moment of launch, engineers propose a special \"burn-in\" protocol for the very first component installed. This initial component has a lifetime $X_D$ drawn from a potentially different CDF, $F_D(x)$. The goal is to choose $F_D(x)$ such that the system exhibits no start-up transient effects in its failure behavior. Specifically, the expected number of component failures up to any time $t$, denoted $E[N_D(t)]$, must be perfectly proportional to the elapsed time $t$, following the relationship $E[N_D(t)] = t/\\mu$ for all $t \\geq 0$.\n\nAssuming that such a burn-in protocol is successfully implemented, an auditor, arriving at some arbitrary time $t > 0$, inspects the system.

This is the defining property of a stationary (equilibrium) renewal process with rate $1/\\mu$, which is achieved by choosing the initial life to have the equilibrium (or stationary excess) distribution. Consequently, the process is stationary from time $t=0$, and any fixed time $t>0$ is a typical time with respect to the stationary measure.\n\nLet $T$ denote the total lifetime of the component that is in service at an arbitrary time $t>0$.
