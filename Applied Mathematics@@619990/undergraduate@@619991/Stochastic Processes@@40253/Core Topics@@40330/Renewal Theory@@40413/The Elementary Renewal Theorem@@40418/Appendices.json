This constitutes a renewal process. The time between consecutive failures, known as the inter-renewal time, is a random variable $X$ that is uniformly distributed on the interval $[0, 2]$ in units of months.\n\nTo test the long-term behavior of this system, a simulation is performed. The inter-renewal times $X_i$ are generated using the inverse transform sampling method from a sequence of standard uniform random variates $U_i \\sim U(0,1)$. The transformation is given by $X_i = 2 U_i$.\n\nSuppose the simulation begins at time $t=0$ with a new component. Using the first twelve random variates from a $U(0,1)$ generator provided below, calculate the empirical rate of failures up to time $t = 10.0$ months.
