The light cycles through green, yellow, and red phases. The duration of the green phase is a fixed constant $t_g$, and the duration of the yellow phase is a fixed constant $t_y$.\n\nTo improve traffic flow, the duration of the red phase is adaptive. After the yellow light ends, the system waits for a suitable gap in the cross-traffic before switching to green. This waiting time, which constitutes the red phase duration, is a random variable.
