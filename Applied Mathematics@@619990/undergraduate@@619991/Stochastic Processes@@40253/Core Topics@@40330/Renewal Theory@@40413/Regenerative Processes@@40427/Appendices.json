We'll examine an insurance surplus model based on a diffusion process, a powerful tool for modeling financial quantities. The regenerative cycle is defined by a specific dividend policy, and your task is to calculate a crucial risk metric: the probability of financial distress within one cycle.

The constant $\\mu > 0$ represents the average net premium rate (premiums collected minus expected claims paid), and $\\sigma > 0$ is the volatility parameter of the surplus.\n\nThe company employs a dividend strategy based on a regenerative process. A cycle begins with the surplus at a level $u$. The process evolves until the surplus first reaches an upper barrier $U$, where $U > u$. At this moment, a dividend is paid out, and the surplus is instantaneously reset to the level $u$, marking the end of the current cycle and the beginning of a brand new, identical cycle.\n\nA key concern for the regulator is the risk of the company's surplus dropping too low. A \"distress level\" is defined at a surplus value of $z$, where $0 < z < u$. We are interested in the risk of entering this distress state during a standard operational cycle.\n\nAssuming the parameters $U, u, z, \\mu,$ and $\\sigma$ are all positive constants, determine the probability that the surplus $S(t)$ will drop to or below the distress level $z$ at some point during a single cycle, which starts with the surplus at $u$ and ends when the surplus first reaches $U$.
