The jump is a displacement of magnitude $\\Delta x$ either to the positive direction (right) or the negative direction (left), with an equal probability of $1/2$ for each choice.

This thought experiment challenges that notion by asking you to consider the distribution of the proportion of time the walk is positive. This leads to the celebrated arcsine law, revealing that the most likely outcomes are for the walk to spend almost all or almost none of its time on one side of the origin, a profound feature of Brownian paths [@problem_id:1330651].", "problem": "An analyst is studying a simplified model for the daily fluctuation of a stock price. The model assumes the stock's price change each day is a random step. Let the price deviation from its initial value on day $n$ be $S_n$. The process starts at $S_0 = 0$. Each day, the price deviation either increases by one unit or decreases by one unit with equal probability. This is a classic simple symmetric random walk.\n\nThe analyst runs a large number of simulations, $M$, of this process. Each simulation runs for a total of $N=500$ days (steps). For each of the $M$ individual simulations, the analyst calculates the proportion of days the price deviation was strictly positive. That is, for each simulation run $j \\in \\{1, ..., M\\}$, they compute the value $p_j$, where $p_j$ is the number of days $n \\in \\{1, ..., N\\}$ for which $S_n > 0$, divided by the total number of days $N$.\n\nAfter collecting the values $\\{p_1, p_2, ..., p_M\\}$, the analyst plots a histogram to visualize their distribution.
