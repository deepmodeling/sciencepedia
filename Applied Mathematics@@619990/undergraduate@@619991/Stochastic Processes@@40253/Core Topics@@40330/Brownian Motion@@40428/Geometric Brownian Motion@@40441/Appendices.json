The resulting process is a type of jump-diffusion model with time-dependent volatility.\n\n-   **Scientific Grounding:** The concepts used (GBM, SDE, log-returns, volatility, jumps, kurtosis, quadratic variation, option pricing, autocorrelation, MLE) are all standard and rigorously defined within mathematics, statistics, and computational finance.

A data-generating process is specified, and the task is to analyze its properties. The description is sufficient to deduce the characteristics of the resulting time series of log-returns.\n-   **Objective:** The language is technical and precise. It does not contain subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is a valid problem in computational finance. I will now proceed with the analysis of each option.\n\n**Theoretical Framework**\nUnder a standard GBM, the logarithm of the asset price, $\\ln S_t$, follows an arithmetic Brownian motion. By Itô's lemma, $d(\\ln S_t) = (\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)dt + \\sigma dW_t$. The discrete log-return over a period $\\Delta t$ is thus an independent increment:\n$$r_k = \\ln S_{t_{k+1}} - \\ln S_{t_k} = \\int_{t_k}^{t_{k+1}} (\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)ds + \\int_{t_k}^{t_{k+1}} \\sigma dW_s$$\nThis implies that the returns $r_k$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) as a Gaussian random variable, $r_k \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left((\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)\\Delta t, \\sigma^2\\Delta t\\right)$.\n\nThe modified process deviates from this in two critical ways:\n1.  **Jump:** It introduces a discontinuity. The log-return spanning the jump time $\\tau$ (let's say $\\tau=t_j$) will be $r_{j-1} = \\ln(S_{t_j}/S_{t_{j-1}}) = \\ln(S_{t_j^-}(1+J)/S_{t_{j-1}}) = \\ln(S_{t_j^-}/S_{t_{j-1}}) + \\ln(1+J)$. This is a normal GBM return shifted by a large negative constant $\\ln(1+J)$.\n2.  **Volatility Spike:** The volatility $\\sigma_t$ is no longer constant. It is a piecewise-constant function: $\\sigma_t = \\sigma$ for $t \\notin [\\tau, \\tau+\\delta]$ and $\\sigma_t = \\sigma_{\\text{crash}}$ for $t \\in [\\tau, \\tau+\\delta]$. Consequently, the log-returns are no longer identically distributed; their variance changes during the spike period.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. The empirical distribution of $r_k$ remains Gaussian with mean $(\\mu-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)\\Delta t$ and variance $\\sigma^2\\Delta t$ even after introducing the crash and the volatility spike.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The distribution of the set of log-returns $\\{r_k\\}$ is a mixture of distributions, not a single Gaussian. Firstly, the single jump at $\\tau$ introduces a large negative outlier, which makes the empirical distribution non-Gaussian and heavily skewed to the left. Secondly, the returns generated during the window $[\\tau, \\tau+\\delta]$ are drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a different variance, $\\sigma_{\\text{crash}}^2 \\Delta t$, where $\\sigma_{\\text{crash}}  \\sigma$. A mixture of Gaussian distributions with different parameters is not, in general, a Gaussian distribution. Therefore, the empirical distribution is demonstrably not the original Gaussian distribution.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The single jump induces excess kurtosis in the distribution of $r_k$ relative to the Gaussian benchmark, and the realized quadratic variation $\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} r_k^2$ will understate the total variation contributed by the crash because jumps contribute only linearly to variation.**\nThis statement consists of two parts. The first part is correct: jumps cause fat tails (leptokurtosis). A Gaussian distribution has zero excess kurtosis. The jump creates a large, discrete outlier in the log-return series. The presence of such an outlier drastically increases the fourth central moment of the empirical distribution relative to its variance, leading to a large positive excess kurtosis (leptokurtosis). This part is correct.\nThe second part claims that the realized quadratic variation (QV), $\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} r_k^2$, understates something because \"jumps contribute only linearly to variation\". This reasoning is fundamentally flawed. The realized QV is an estimator for the true quadratic variation of the log-price process. For a process with a jump of size $\\Delta_j = \\ln(1+J)$, its true QV over an interval is the sum of the integrated variance (the continuous part) and the sum of squared jumps: $\\int \\sigma_t^2 dt + \\Delta_j^2$. The realized QV, $\\sum r_k^2$, correctly captures this by including the term $r_j^2 \\approx \\Delta_j^2$. The claim that jumps contribute \"linearly\" to \"variation\" is a nonsensical mix of concepts. Jumps contribute quadratically to quadratic variation. The realized QV does not \"understate\" the crash's contribution; it incorporates it, making the sum much larger than the integrated variance of the continuous part alone. The reasoning provided is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The sample path of $S_t$ is no longer almost surely continuous, violating a key property of geometric Brownian motion; moreover, deep out-of-the-money put options priced under the Black–Scholes–Merton (BSM) assumptions would be systematically underpriced relative to prices implied by the jump-augmented data.**\nThis statement is correct. The first clause is a direct consequence of the problem definition. The imposed jump $S_{\\tau}=S_{\\tau^-}(1+J)$ with $J \\neq 0$ creates a discontinuity in the sample path at time $\\tau$. The sample paths of a GBM process are, by definition, almost surely continuous. This modification thus violates a fundamental property of GBM.\nThe second clause addresses option pricing. The BSM model assumes a GBM process, which implies that future log-prices are normally distributed. This distribution has tails that decay exponentially. The jump-augmented process, however, has fatter tails (is leptokurtic), particularly on the left side due to the crash component $J0$. A deep out-of-the-money (OTM) put option has a strike price $K$ far below the current price $S_t$ and pays off only in the event of a large price drop. The BSM model assigns a very low probability to such an event. The jump-augmented process allows for such a drop to occur with a much higher probability via a single jump event. Consequently, the true value of a deep OTM put (its expected payoff under the appropriate risk-neutral measure) is higher than the value calculated using the BSM formula. The BSM price is a systematic underestimation. This is consistent with the empirically observed volatility smirk.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Under geometric Brownian motion with constant $\\sigma$, powers of returns such as $|r_k|$ have zero autocorrelation due to independent increments; with the temporary elevation $\\sigma_{\\text{crash}}$ over $[\\tau,\\tau+\\delta]$, the empirical absolute returns will display positive autocorrelation around the crash window, contradicting the constant-volatility assumption.**\nThis statement is correct. Under standard GBM, the log-returns $r_k$ are i.i.d. random variables. This implies that any transformation of these returns, such as the absolute returns $|r_k|$ or squared returns $r_k^2$, will also form an i.i.d. sequence. An i.i.d. sequence has zero autocorrelation for all non-zero lags. This is a key theoretical property of GBM.\nThe modified process explicitly introduces time-varying volatility: it is low ($\\sigma$), then high ($\\sigma_{\\text{crash}}$), then low again. During the period $[\\tau, \\tau+\\delta]$, the magnitude of returns, characterized by $|r_k|$, will be consistently higher than outside this period. A large value of $|r_k|$ at time $t_k$ within this window makes it highly probable that the next value $|r_{k+1}|$ will also be large, as it is likely generated under the same high-volatility regime. This persistence of volatility levels leads to clusters of large (and small) returns, which manifests statistically as positive autocorrelation in the sequence of absolute or squared returns. This phenomenon is known as volatility clustering, a well-known stylized fact of financial markets that standard GBM cannot explain.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of $\\sigma$ based on the Gaussian likelihood for $r_k$ is guaranteed to be unbiased even if the sample includes the crash and the volatility spike, because the likelihood score equations are robust to jumps.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The MLE procedure described is based on the assumption that the data are generated by a single Gaussian distribution, which is a model misspecification. The standard Gaussian likelihood is known to be non-robust; it is exquisitely sensitive to outliers. The log-return corresponding to the jump is a large outlier that will heavily skew the estimation. The sample variance of the log-returns will be greatly inflated by both the jump term and the higher-variance returns from the spike period. The MLE for $\\sigma^2$ is closely related to this sample variance and will therefore produce a significantly overestimated value for the baseline volatility $\\sigma$. The estimator is neither unbiased nor robust. The claim that likelihood score equations are robust to jumps is false for a standard Gaussian model.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{CD}$$", "id": "2397815"}]}
