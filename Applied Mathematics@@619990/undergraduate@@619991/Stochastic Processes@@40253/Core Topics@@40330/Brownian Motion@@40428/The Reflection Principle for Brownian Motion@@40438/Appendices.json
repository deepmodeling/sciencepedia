The displacement $X(t)$ from its equilibrium position, measured in micrometers (μm), is modeled as a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion, where time $t$ is measured in seconds.

However, the monitoring equipment can only register the displacement value at the exact end of the 16-second interval, not the maximum value during the interval.

Solving this requires us to think not just about final probabilities, but about the ensemble of random paths and the elegant symmetry that the reflection principle uncovers.", "problem": "A materials scientist is studying the one-dimensional diffusion of a nanoparticle on a specialized substrate. The position of the particle at time $t$, denoted by $B_t$, is modeled as a standard Brownian motion starting from the origin, so $B_0=0$. The time $t$ is measured in seconds, and the position is measured in nanometers.\n\nAt a position $a > 0$, there is a reactive strip on the substrate. If the nanoparticle's trajectory ever reaches this position, a permanent and irreversible chemical change is induced in the particle. At a later time, it's possible to test whether this change has occurred.\n\nAt a specific time $t_f > 0$, an experiment is conducted to measure the particle's current position, without disturbing its state. The measurement reveals that the particle is at position $x_f$, where it is known that $x_f < a$.\n\nGiven this measurement, what is the probability that the particle has undergone the chemical change at some time $s$ in the interval $[0, t_f]$? Express your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of the given parameters $a$, $t_f$, and $x_f$.", "solution": "Let $\\{B_s\\}_{s \\ge 0}$ be the standard Brownian motion representing the particle's position. The process starts at $B_0=0$. The particle undergoes a chemical change if its path reaches or crosses the level $a > 0$. The event that the particle has undergone this change by time $t_f$ can be expressed mathematically as $\\{ \\sup_{0 \\le s \\le t_f} B_s \\ge a \\}$. Let's denote the maximum position reached by time $t_f$ as $M_{t_f} = \\sup_{0 \\le s \\le t_f} B_s$.\n\nWe are given that at time $t_f$, the particle's position is $B_{t_f} = x_f$, where $x_f < a$. We need to find the conditional probability $P(M_{t_f} \\ge a | B_{t_f} = x_f)$.\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for continuous random variables, this can be expressed as a ratio of probability density functions (PDFs). Informally, we can write:\n$$ P(M_{t_f} \\ge a | B_{t_f} = x_f) = \\frac{f_{\\text{joint}}(M_{t_f} \\ge a, B_{t_f} = x_f)}{f_{B_{t_f}}(x_f)} $$\nwhere $f_{B_{t_f}}(x_f)$ is the PDF of the Brownian motion at time $t_f$ evaluated at $x_f$, and $f_{\\text{joint}}(M_{t_f} \\ge a, B_{t_f} = x_f)$ represents the probability density for the joint event that the maximum is at least $a$ and the final position is $x_f$.\n\nTo find the numerator, we employ the reflection principle for Brownian motion. The reflection principle establishes a correspondence between paths that reach a certain level and paths that end at a \"reflected\" position.\nSpecifically, for $x_f < a$, any path from $(0, 0)$ to $(t_f, x_f)$ that touches or crosses the line $y=a$ can be mapped to a unique path from $(0, 0)$ to $(t_f, 2a - x_f)$. This mapping is constructed by reflecting the portion of the path after its first hitting time of level $a$. Conversely, any path from $(0, 0)$ to $(t_f, 2a - x_f)$ must cross the level $a$ (since $a>0$ and $2a-x_f > a$), and reflecting its portion after the first hitting time of $a$ yields a unique path from $(0,0)$ to $(t_f, x_f)$ that has touched level $a$.\n\nThis one-to-one correspondence implies that the \"number\" of paths, and thus the probability density, is the same for both events. Therefore, the density of the joint event $\\{M_{t_f} \\ge a, B_{t_f} = x_f\\}$ is equal to the density of the event $\\{B_{t_f} = 2a - x_f\\}$.\n$$ f_{\\text{joint}}(M_{t_f} \\ge a, B_{t_f} = x_f) = f_{B_{t_f}}(2a - x_f) $$\n\nThe position of a standard Brownian motion at time $t$, $B_t$, follows a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance $t$. Its PDF is given by:\n$$ f_{B_t}(z) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z^2}{2t}\\right) $$\n\nNow we can compute the conditional probability:\n$$ P(M_{t_f} \\ge a | B_{t_f} = x_f) = \\frac{f_{B_{t_f}}(2a - x_f)}{f_{B_{t_f}}(x_f)} $$\nSubstituting the PDF expression:\n$$ P(M_{t_f} \\ge a | B_{t_f} = x_f) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t_f}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(2a - x_f)^2}{2t_f}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t_f}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x_f^2}{2t_f}\\right)} $$\nThe term $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t_f}}$ cancels out. We are left with a ratio of exponentials, which can be simplified by subtracting the exponents:\n$$ P(M_{t_f} \\ge a | B_{t_f} = x_f) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(2a - x_f)^2}{2t_f} - \\left(-\\frac{x_f^2}{2t_f}\\right)\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{x_f^2 - (2a - x_f)^2}{2t_f}\\right) $$\nLet's simplify the term in the numerator of the exponent:\n$$ x_f^2 - (2a - x_f)^2 = x_f^2 - (4a^2 - 4ax_f + x_f^2) = x_f^2 - 4a^2 + 4ax_f - x_f^2 = 4ax_f - 4a^2 $$\nWe can factor out $-4a$:\n$$ 4ax_f - 4a^2 = -4a(a - x_f) $$\nSubstituting this back into the exponential:\n$$ P(M_{t_f} \\ge a | B_{t_f} = x_f) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{-4a(a - x_f)}{2t_f}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2a(a - x_f)}{t_f}\\right) $$\nThis is the final expression for the desired probability.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2a(a-x_f)}{t_f}\\right)}$$", "id": "1344197"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice extends the use of the reflection principle beyond calculating the probability of specific events.
