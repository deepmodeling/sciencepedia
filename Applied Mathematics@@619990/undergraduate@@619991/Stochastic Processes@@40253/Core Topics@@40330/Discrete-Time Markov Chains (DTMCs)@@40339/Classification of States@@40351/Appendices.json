This distinction gives rise to the concepts of recurrence (certain return) and transience (a non-zero probability of never returning).

The player's journey is modeled as a discrete-time Markov chain on the state space $S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, where the state represents the player's current level. The transition probabilities between levels are given as follows:\n- From level 1, the player has a probability $p_{11}  0$ of replaying the level and a probability $p_{12}  0$ of advancing to level 2, with $p_{11} + p_{12} = 1$.\n- From level 2, the player has a probability $p_{21}  0$ of being sent back to level 1 and a probability $p_{23}  0$ of advancing to level 3, with $p_{21} + p_{23} = 1$.\n- From level 3, the player has a probability $p_{32}  0$ of being sent back to level 2 and a probability $p_{34}  0$ of advancing to level 4, with $p_{32} + p_{34} = 1$.\n- Level 4 is the final 'Game Over' level.

By assumption, level $4$ is absorbing, so $p_{44}=1$ and $p_{4j}=0$ for all $j \\neq 4$. A state $i$ is recurrent if, when starting from $i$, the probability of ever returning to $i$ equals $1$; it is transient if that probability is strictly less than $1$. In a finite Markov chain, recurrent states necessarily belong to closed communicating classes; moreover, every non-closed communicating class consists entirely of transient states.\n\nFirst, we establish the communication relations among levels $1,2,3$:\n- From level $1$, $p_{12}0$, so $1 \\to 2$.\n- From level $2$, $p_{21}0$ and $p_{23}0$, so $2 \\to 1$ and $2 \\to 3$.\n- From level $3$, $p_{32}0$ and $p_{34}0$, so $3 \\to 2$ and $3 \\to 4$.\n\nThus, within $\\{1,2,3\\}$ we have $1 \\leftrightarrow 2$ (since $1 \\to 2$ and $2 \\to 1$) and $2 \\leftrightarrow 3$ (since $2 \\to 3$ and $3 \\to 2$), hence $1,2,3$ all communicate with each other; i.e., $\\{1,2,3\\}$ is a single communicating class. However, this class is not closed because from state $3$ there is a positive probability $p_{34}0$ to move to state $4 \\notin \\{1,2,3\\}$. Therefore, by the finite-state classification theorem, every state in the non-closed communicating class $\\{1,2,3\\}$ is transient.\n\nEquivalently, since the only closed class is $\\{4\\}$ and it is absorbing, and since from any $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ there exists a path to $4$ with positive probability (e.g., $1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 4$ with product probability $p_{12} p_{23} p_{34}  0$), absorption at $4$ occurs with probability $1$ starting from any of $1,2,3$. Hence the probability of returning infinitely often to any of $1,2,3$ is zero, which confirms that $1,2,3$ are transient.\n\nTherefore, all three states $1,2,3$ are transient, corresponding to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1288866"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply knowing if a return to a state is certain, we can also investigate the timing of these returns.

The states of the chain correspond to different market sentiments (e.g., 'bullish', 'bearish', 'stable'). For one particular state, defined as the 'stable' state, an analysis of the algorithm's state-transition diagram reveals the following possible return times: starting from the 'stable' state, it is possible for the system to return to this same state in 4 time steps. It is also possible for a return to occur in 6 time steps. Finally, a longer cyclic path allows for a return in 8 time steps.\n\nBased on this information about possible return times, calculate the period of the 'stable' state.", "solution": "By definition, the period of a state $i$ in a discrete-time Markov chain is\n$$\nd(i) = \\gcd\\{n \\geq 1 : P_{ii}^{(n)}  0\\}.\n$$\nWe are told that starting from the 'stable' state $i$, returns are possible in $n=4$, $n=6$, and $n=8$ steps, so the set in the definition contains these values.
