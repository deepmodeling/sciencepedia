Let's define the rules of a standard game:\n\n1.  Points are awarded in the sequence: 15, 30, 40. For our model, we can represent these scores as 1, 2, and 3 points, respectively. A score of zero is 'Love'.\n2.  A player wins the game if they have won at least 4 points and are ahead of their opponent by at least 2 points.\n3.

A state is absorbing if a player has won. According to the rules, a player wins if they have at least 4 points and lead by at least 2 points. All other states are transient.\n\nWe can count the transient states by considering the possible scores:\n\n1.  **Standard Scores:** The game proceeds through scores $(i, j)$ where $i$ and $j$ represent the points won by player 1 and player 2, respectively. Using the mapping {Love:0, 15:1, 30:2, 40:3}, the scores before any player reaches 4 points are represented by the grid of pairs $(i,j)$ where $0 \\leq i, j \\leq 3$. All of these $4 \\times 4 = 16$ scores are transient, as the game has not concluded. This includes the score (3,3), which is the 'Deuce' state.\n\n2.  **Advantage States:** When the score is 'Deuce' (3-3), the game does not end on the next point.
