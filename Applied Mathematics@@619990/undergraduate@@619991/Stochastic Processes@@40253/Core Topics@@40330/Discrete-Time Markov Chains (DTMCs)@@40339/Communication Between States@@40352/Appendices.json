The state of the elevator is observed at discrete time steps. The system can be in one of four states:\n- $S_1$: Idle at Floor 1.\n- $S_2$: Moving from Floor 1 to Floor 2.\n- $S_3$: Idle at Floor 2.\n- $S_4$: Moving from Floor 2 to Floor 1.\n\nThe transitions between states are probabilistic and are governed by the following rules:\n1.  If the elevator is in state $S_1$ (Idle at Floor 1), there is a probability $p_u$ that a passenger request will cause it to enter state $S_2$ (Moving Up) in the next time step. Otherwise, it remains in state $S_1$.\n2.  If the elevator is in state $S_3$ (Idle at Floor 2), there is a probability $p_d$ that a passenger request will cause it to enter state $S_4$ (Moving Down) in the next time step. Otherwise, it remains in state $S_3$.\n3.  If the elevator is in state $S_2$ (Moving Up), there is a small probability $\\epsilon$ of a minor mechanical fault that forces an immediate reset, returning it to state $S_1$ in the next time step.

This exercise introduces the crucial concept of communicating classes, which are sets of states that are mutually accessible. Using a model of a data-parsing automaton, you will practice identifying these classes and learn to recognize special cases like absorbing states, which have a profound impact on the long-term behavior of the system [@problem_id:1290025].", "problem": "A research team is modeling the behavior of a specialized automaton designed to parse a proprietary communication protocol. The automaton's state at any discrete time step is determined by the type of data packet it is currently processing. The system can be modeled as a discrete-time Markov chain with four possible states: `SYNC` (Synchronization), `DATA` (Data Payload), `CTRL` (Control), and `ACK` (Acknowledgement).\n\nThe state transitions are governed by the following probabilistic rules:\n- From state `SYNC`, the automaton always transitions to state `DATA`.\n- From state `DATA`, it transitions back to `DATA` with a probability of 0.6 or to `CTRL` with a probability of 0.4.\n- From state `CTRL`, it transitions to `ACK` with a probability of 0.8 or to `SYNC` with a probability of 0.2.\n- From state `ACK`, it always transitions back to `ACK`.\n\nBased on this model, which of the following statements about the relationships between the states is true?\n\nA.

The one-step transition probabilities are:\n$$P(\\text{SYNC}\\to\\text{DATA})=1,$$\n$$P(\\text{DATA}\\to\\text{DATA})=0.6,\\quad P(\\text{DATA}\\to\\text{CTRL})=0.4,$$\n$$P(\\text{CTRL}\\to\\text{ACK})=0.8,\\quad P(\\text{CTRL}\\to\\text{SYNC})=0.2,$$\n$$P(\\text{ACK}\\to\\text{ACK})=1.$$\n\nTo test communication, recall that states $i$ and $j$ communicate if there exist $m,n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ with $P^{m}_{ij}>0$ and $P^{n}_{ji}>0$.\n\n1) For statement A, $\\text{SYNC}$ reaches $\\text{ACK}$ with\n$$P^{3}_{\\text{SYNC},\\text{ACK}}\\ge P_{\\text{SYNC},\\text{DATA}}P_{\\text{DATA},\\text{CTRL}}P_{\\text{CTRL},\\text{ACK}}=1\\cdot 0.4\\cdot 0.8>0.$$\nHowever, from $\\text{ACK}$ we have $P(\\text{ACK}\\to\\text{ACK})=1$, so for every $n\\ge 1$, $P^{n}_{\\text{ACK},j}=0$ for any $j\\neq \\text{ACK}$.

From $\\text{DATA}$, the time to first hit $\\text{CTRL}$ is geometric with success probability $0.4$, so the probability to eventually hit $\\text{CTRL}$ is $1$. From $\\text{CTRL}$, with probability $0.8$ the chain goes to $\\text{ACK}$, and with probability $0.2$ it goes to $\\text{SYNC}\\to\\text{DATA}$ and repeats. The probability to avoid $\\text{ACK}$ forever would be $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}(0.2)^{n}=0$, so the probability to be absorbed in $\\text{ACK}$ eventually (starting from $\\text{DATA}$) is $1$. Since from $\\text{ACK}$ no other state is reachable, the probability of infinitely many returns to $\\text{DATA}$ is $0$, so $\\text{DATA}$ is transient, not recurrent.

Note this class is not closed because $P_{\\text{CTRL},\\text{ACK}}=0.8>0$. Therefore C is true.\n\n4) For statement D, a chain is irreducible if there is a single communicating class. Here $\\text{ACK}$ does not communicate with any other state (it is absorbing), so there are at least two communicating classes: $\\{\\text{SYNC},\\text{DATA},\\text{CTRL}\\}$ and $\\{\\text{ACK}\\}$. Hence D is false.\n\n5) For statement E, since $P(\\text{ACK}\\to\\text{ACK})=1$, starting from $\\text{ACK}$ the chain returns to $\\text{ACK}$ in one step with probability $1$, so $\\text{ACK}$ is recurrent (indeed absorbing), not transient.
