The state $H$ represents a central hub.

From the hub state $H$, the particle must move to either System 1 or System 2.

Within System 1, the states $\\{T_{1a}, T_{1b}, T_{1c}\\}$ are fully connected. From any state in this system, the particle will transition to one of the other two states in the same system with equal probability.

A communicating class is a maximal set of mutually communicating states. A class is closed if no transition leaves the set; otherwise it is open. In a finite Markov chain, any open class contains transient states, and any closed irreducible class is recurrent.\n\nFrom rule 1, from $H$ the chain moves to $T_{1a}$ with probability $p$ and to $T_{2a}$ with probability $1-p$, and once it leaves $H$ it can never return. Thus, for any $x \\in \\{T_{1a},T_{1b},T_{1c},T_{2a},T_{2b},T_{2c}\\}$, $H \\to x$ is possible, but $x \\to H$ is impossible. Therefore, $H$ does not communicate with any other state. Since every state communicates with itself, $\\{H\\}$ is a singleton communicating class. It is not closed, because there are transitions from $H$ to states outside $\\{H\\}$. Consequently, $H$ is a transient state, so $\\{H\\}$ is a transient communicating class.\n\nFrom rule 2, within System 1, $\\{T_{1a},T_{1b},T_{1c}\\}$, each state transitions to one of the other two with positive probability and no transitions go outside System 1. Hence, each pair of states in System 1 reaches each other (in one or two steps), so they communicate and form a single communicating class. Since no transitions leave this set, it is a closed communicating class.\n\nFrom rule 3, the same reasoning applies to System 2, $\\{T_{2a},T_{2b},T_{2c}\\}$: it is a single communicating class and it is closed.\n\nTherefore, the state space partitions into one transient communicating class $\\{H\\}$ and two closed communicating classes $\\{T_{1a},T_{1b},T_{1c}\\}$ and $\\{T_{2a},T_{2b},T_{2c}\\}$.

Let $\\mathcal{C}_{n}\\subseteq\\mathcal{G}_{n}$ denote the set of connected graphs.\n\nClaim 1: $\\mathcal{C}_{n}$ is closed for all $n\\geq 1$.\nLet $G\\in\\mathcal{C}_{n}$ so that $G$ is connected, equivalently $c(G)=1$ where $c(G)$ denotes the number of connected components. Consider any one-step transition from $G$:\n- If a nonedge $(u,v)$ is selected, then $G_{t+1}=G\\cup\\{(u,v)\\}$, which is connected since adding an edge cannot increase $c(\\cdot)$ and cannot disconnect a connected graph. Thus $c(G_{t+1})=1$.\n- If an existing edge $(u,v)$ is selected and is not a bridge, then $G_{t+1}=G\\setminus\\{(u,v)\\}$ remains connected by the definition of non-bridge (removing a non-bridge does not increase $c(\\cdot)$; in particular, $c(G\\setminus\\{(u,v)\\})=c(G)=1$).\n- If an existing edge $(u,v)$ is selected and is a bridge, then no change occurs, so $G_{t+1}=G$ and remains connected.\nIn all cases, starting from $G\\in\\mathcal{C}_{n}$ we have $G_{t+1}\\in\\mathcal{C}_{n}$. Hence $\\mathcal{C}_{n}$ is closed.\n\nClaim 2: $\\mathcal{C}_{n}$ is a single communicating class for all $n\\geq 1$.\nFix any $G,H\\in\\mathcal{C}_{n}$. We exhibit a path of allowed transitions from $G$ to $H$ with positive probability that remains in $\\mathcal{C}_{n}$ throughout.\n\nStep 2.1: From $G$ to the complete graph $K_{n}$. For each edge $e\\in E(K_{n})\\setminus E(G)$, select its endpoint pair when it is absent; by the chain’s rule, the transition $G\\mapsto G\\cup\\{e\\}$ occurs. Repeating for all missing edges produces a finite sequence of additions leading to $K_{n}$. Each chosen pair has probability $\\frac{1}{\\binom{n}{2}}$ at each step, so the specific sequence occurs with positive probability. Connectivity is preserved at each step by the argument in Claim 1.\n\nStep 2.2: From $K_{n}$ to $H$ by deleting only edges not in $H$. Consider the set $F=E(K_{n})\\setminus E(H)$ of edges to be removed. We remove the edges of $F$ one by one in any order, never attempting to delete an edge of $H$. At every intermediate step the current graph includes $H$ as a spanning connected subgraph. For any edge $e=\\{x,y\\}\\in F$ present at an intermediate step, since $H$ is connected there exists an $x$–$y$ path entirely in $H$. Therefore $e$ lies on a cycle formed by $e$ and that path, implying $e$ is not a bridge in the current graph. Hence the chain permits its deletion. Repeating yields $H$ after finitely many steps. As before, selecting the specific pairs in this sequence has positive probability, and connectivity is preserved at each step.\n\nCombining Steps 2.1 and 2.2, $H$ is reachable from $G$ with positive probability while staying in $\\mathcal{C}_{n}$. By symmetry (or by repeating the construction swapping $G$ and $H$), any two states in $\\mathcal{C}_{n}$ communicate. Thus $\\mathcal{C}_{n}$ is a communicating class.\n\nEdge cases: For $n=1$, $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ consists of the single (connected) graph with no edges, which is trivially a closed communicating class. For $n=2$, $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$ consists of the single connected graph with one edge; the edge is a bridge, so no deletion occurs and no other additions are possible, making it a closed singleton communicating class. These are consistent with the arguments above.\n\nTherefore, for every $n\\geq 1$, $\\mathcal{C}_{n}$ forms a single, closed communicating class.
