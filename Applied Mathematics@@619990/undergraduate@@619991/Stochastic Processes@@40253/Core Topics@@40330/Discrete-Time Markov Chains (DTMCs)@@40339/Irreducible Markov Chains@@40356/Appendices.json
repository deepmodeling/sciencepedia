{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The predictability of a Markov chain's long-term behavior depends on the properties of its states. One such property is periodicity, which describes the rhythm or cycle of returns to a state. This exercise provides a clear and intuitive introduction to the concept of a state's period by modeling a simple, deterministic patrol route. By analyzing the possible return times, you will directly compute the period as their greatest common divisor, grounding the formal definition in a tangible scenario [@problem_id:1312357].", "problem": "A security robot is programmed to patrol three distinct zones: Zone A, Zone B, and Zone C. The robot's movement is deterministic and occurs in discrete time steps. Its schedule is as follows:\n- If it is in Zone A at time step $t$, it will be in Zone B at time step $t+1$.\n- If it is in Zone B at time step $t$, it will be in Zone C at time step $t+1$.\n- If it is in Zone C at time step $t$, it will be in Zone A at time step $t+1$.\nThe robot cannot stay in the same zone or move to any other zone than the one specified by the protocol.\n\nAssume the robot starts in Zone A at time $t=0$. Let the set $\\mathcal{T}$ contain all possible time steps $t > 0$ for which the robot is found back in Zone A.

Define a map $f$ by $f(A)=B$, $f(B)=C$, and $f(C)=A$. Then the robotâ€™s position at time $t$ is $f^{t}(A)$, where $f^{t}$ denotes the $t$-fold composition of $f$.\n\nCompute successive iterates:\n$$\nf^{1}(A)=B,\\quad f^{2}(A)=C,\\quad f^{3}(A)=A.\n$$\nThus $f$ is a $3$-cycle and has order $3$, so\n$$\nf^{t+3}(A)=f^{t}(A)\\quad\\text{for all integers }t\\geq 0.\n$$\nTherefore the robot is back in Zone A exactly when $3$ divides $t$.

While this often involves solving a system of linear equations, we can sometimes leverage the system's structure for a more elegant solution. This problem models a random walk on a symmetric ring of states, inviting you to use a symmetry argument to find the stationary distribution and discover a key property of such balanced systems [@problem_id:1312387].", "problem": "A particle performs a random walk on a set of five states, labeled $S = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The states are arranged in a ring. At each time step, if the particle is in state $i$, it moves to state $(i+1) \\pmod 5$ with probability $p$, and to state $(i-1) \\pmod 5$ with probability $q = 1-p$. The parameter $p$ is a constant such that $0 < p < 1$. This process defines a discrete-time Markov chain on the state space $S$. Assuming that the chain possesses a unique stationary distribution $\\pi = (\\pi_0, \\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\pi_3, \\pi_4)$, what is this distribution? Express your answer as a row vector.", "solution": "Let $\\pi = (\\pi_0, \\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\pi_3, \\pi_4)$ be the stationary distribution of the Markov chain. By definition, a stationary distribution must satisfy the equation $\\pi = \\pi P$, where $P$ is the transition probability matrix of the chain. This can be written component-wise as:\n$$ \\pi_j = \\sum_{i \\in S} \\pi_i P_{ij} \\quad \\text{for } j \\in S $$\nHere, $P_{ij}$ is the probability of transitioning from state $i$ to state $j$. According to the problem description, the only non-zero transitions are to adjacent states. For any state $j$, a particle can only arrive at $j$ from state $(j-1) \\pmod 5$ or state $(j+1) \\pmod 5$.\n\nThe transition from $(j-1) \\pmod 5$ to $j$ is a step in the positive (clockwise) direction, so its probability is $p$. Thus, $P_{(j-1)\\pmod 5, j} = p$.\nThe transition from $(j+1) \\pmod 5$ to $j$ is a step in the negative (anti-clockwise) direction, so its probability is $q=1-p$. Thus, $P_{(j+1)\\pmod 5, j} = q$.\n\nThe balance equation for state $j$ is therefore:\n$$ \\pi_j = \\pi_{(j-1)\\pmod 5} P_{(j-1)\\pmod 5, j} + \\pi_{(j+1)\\pmod 5} P_{(j+1)\\pmod 5, j} $$\n$$ \\pi_j = \\pi_{(j-1)\\pmod 5} \\cdot p + \\pi_{(j+1)\\pmod 5} \\cdot q $$\nThis gives us a system of five linear equations:\n$$ \\pi_0 = p \\cdot \\pi_4 + q \\cdot \\pi_1 $$\n$$ \\pi_1 = p \\cdot \\pi_0 + q \\cdot \\pi_2 $$\n$$ \\pi_2 = p \\cdot \\pi_1 + q \\cdot \\pi_3 $$\n$$ \\pi_3 = p \\cdot \\pi_2 + q \\cdot \\pi_4 $$\n$$ \\pi_4 = p \\cdot \\pi_3 + q \\cdot \\pi_0 $$\nIn addition to these five equations, the probabilities must sum to one:\n$$ \\sum_{i=0}^{4} \\pi_i = \\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 + \\pi_4 = 1 $$\nWhile this system of equations can be solved algebraically, a more elegant solution arises from a symmetry argument. The structure of the state space and the transition rules are rotationally symmetric. The dynamics viewed from any state $i$ are identical to the dynamics viewed from any other state $j$, aside from a relabeling of the states. For instance, the transition probabilities from state 0 to states 1 ($p$) and 4 ($q$) are the same as from state 1 to states 2 ($p$) and 0 ($q$), and so on. This symmetry of the process implies that the long-term probability of being in any particular state must be the same for all states.\nTherefore, in the stationary distribution, we must have:\n$$ \\pi_0 = \\pi_1 = \\pi_2 = \\pi_3 = \\pi_4 $$\nLet's denote this common probability by $c$. So, $\\pi_i = c$ for all $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\nUsing the normalization condition that the sum of all probabilities must be 1:\n$$ \\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 + \\pi_4 = c + c + c + c + c = 5c = 1 $$\nSolving for $c$, we find $c = \\frac{1}{5}$.\nThus, the proposed stationary distribution is $\\pi = (\\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{1}{5})$.\n\nWe can verify this solution by substituting it back into the general balance equation for an arbitrary state $j$:\n$$ \\pi_j = p \\cdot \\pi_{(j-1)\\pmod 5} + q \\cdot \\pi_{(j+1)\\pmod 5} $$\nSubstituting $\\pi_i = 1/5$ for all $i$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{5} \\stackrel{?}{=} p \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} + q \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{5} \\stackrel{?}{=} \\frac{1}{5} (p + q) $$\nBy definition, $q = 1-p$, so $p+q = p + (1-p) = 1$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot 1 $$\nThe equation holds true. Since this verification works for any state $j$, the uniform distribution is indeed the correct stationary distribution. It is noteworthy that the final distribution is independent of the bias parameter $p$. The problem statement guarantees the existence and uniqueness of the stationary distribution, which is consistent with the properties of a finite, irreducible Markov chain (irreducibility is ensured as long as $0 < p < 1$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{5} & \\frac{1}{5} & \\frac{1}{5} & \\frac{1}{5} & \\frac{1}{5} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1312387"}, {"introduction": "While symmetry provides a powerful shortcut, many real-world systems lack such perfect balance, requiring a more direct algebraic approach to determine long-term behavior.
