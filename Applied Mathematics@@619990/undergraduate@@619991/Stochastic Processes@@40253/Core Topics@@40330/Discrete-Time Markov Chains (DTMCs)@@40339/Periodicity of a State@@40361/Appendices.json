In this exercise [@problem_id:1323482], a particle's movement is confined to a \"star graph\" with a central hub and several peripheral nodes. The strict, deterministic-like rules of movement make it easy to trace all possible paths, allowing you to directly calculate the possible return times to the hub and discover its fundamental period.", "problem": "Consider a system modeled by a discrete-time Markov chain on a set of six states, labeled $\\{S_0, S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4, S_5\\}$. The state $S_0$ is called the central hub, and the states $\\{S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4, S_5\\}$ are called the peripheral nodes. The transition rules for a particle moving between these states are defined as follows:\n\n1.  If the particle is at any peripheral node $S_i$ (where $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$), it will transition to the central hub $S_0$ with a probability of 1 in the next time step.\n2.  If the particle is at the central hub $S_0$, it will transition to any one of the five peripheral nodes with equal probability in the next time step. The particle cannot remain at the hub $S_0$.\n\nThe period of a state is defined as the greatest common divisor of all possible numbers of steps it can take for the particle to start at that state and return to it for the first time. Given this system, determine the period of the central hub state, $S_0$.", "solution": "Let the states be $\\{S_{0},S_{1},S_{2},S_{3},S_{4},S_{5}\\}$, with $S_{0}$ the hub and $S_{1},\\dots,S_{5}$ the peripherals.

At time $t=1$, the chain must be at some peripheral $S_{i}$ with probability $1$ because remaining at $S_{0}$ is impossible. At time $t=2$, from that peripheral $S_{i}$, the chain must move to $S_{0}$ with probability $1$. Therefore, the first return time $T$ to $S_{0}$ satisfies $\\Pr(T=2)=1$, so the only possible first return time is $2$.\n\nBy the given definition, the period is the greatest common divisor of all possible first return times. Since the set of possible first return times is $\\{2\\}$, the period is $\\gcd\\{2\\}=2$.\n\nEquivalently, one can note that $\\Pr(X_{n}=S_{0}\\mid X_{0}=S_{0})>0$ if and only if $n$ is even, yielding the same period as $\\gcd\\{2,4,6,\\dots\\}=2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "1323482"}, {"introduction": "Next, we expand our analysis to an infinite state space, a scenario common in modeling physical systems. This problem [@problem_id:1323470] explores a micro-robot's movement on a 2D grid and introduces the powerful technique of a parity argument. By examining how the coordinates change with each diagonal step, you can uncover a hidden constraint that dictates when a return to the origin is possible, revealing the system's periodicity without needing to enumerate every path.", "problem": "A specialized micro-robot is designed to inspect integrated circuits by moving on an effectively infinite 2D grid of integer coordinates, which can be represented by the set $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. The robot starts at the origin, state $(0,0)$. From any given coordinate $(x,y)$, the robot's movement mechanism allows it to move in a single step to one of the four \"diagonal\" locations: $(x+1, y+1)$, $(x+1, y-1)$, $(x-1, y+1)$, or $(x-1, y-1)$. The choice of which of these four valid moves to make is random.\n\nThe robot's path constitutes a discrete-time Markov chain on the state space $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. The period of a state $i$ in a Markov chain is defined as the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all positive integers $n$ for which there exists a non-zero probability of returning to state $i$ in exactly $n$ steps.\n\nDetermine the period of the state $(0,0)$.", "solution": "We analyze the parity constraints induced by the allowed moves. From any state $(x,y)$, a step changes both coordinates by $\\pm 1$. Therefore, at each step the parity of $x$ and the parity of $y$ both flip. Starting from $(0,0)$ where both coordinates are even, after an odd number of steps both coordinates are odd, and after an even number of steps both coordinates are even. Hence a necessary condition to return to $(0,0)$ is that the number of steps $n$ is even. Equivalently, $P^{(n)}((0,0),(0,0))=0$ for all odd $n$.\n\nWe now show that this condition is also sufficient. Consider any even $n=2m$. The two-step sequence\n$$(x,y)\\to(x+1,y-1)\\to(x,y)$$\nreturns to the original state and has non-zero probability. By repeating this two-step loop $m$ times, the robot returns to $(0,0)$ at time $n=2m$ with positive probability. Therefore, for every even $n$, $P^{(n)}((0,0),(0,0))>0$.\n\nCombining these, the set of return times with positive probability is exactly $\\{2,4,6,\\dots\\}$.

The intermediate partial sums are $3$, $6$, and $9$, none congruent to $0 \\pmod{12}$, so this is a first return at step $4$.\n- For $n=5$, take three applications of $+2$ and two of $+3$ in any order; for instance, $+2,+2,+2,+3,+3$ gives a total increment $2+2+2+3+3=12 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$. Any partial sum before the fifth step is at most $10$, hence cannot be congruent to $0 \\pmod{12}$, so this is a first return at step $5$.\n\nTherefore, $n=4$ and $n=5$ are both possible first-return times with positive probability.
