This practice challenges you to apply this concept critically to real-world situations, training your intuition to spot scenarios where the rate of events might change over time due to underlying patterns or external factors. By evaluating different phenomena [@problem_id:1324213], you will learn to distinguish between processes that can be reasonably approximated as stationary and those that clearly cannot.", "problem": "A standard, or homogeneous, Poisson process is often used to model the occurrences of discrete events over a continuous interval, such as time. One of the core assumptions, or postulates, for such a process is the **stationarity postulate**. This postulate asserts that the average rate of event occurrences, denoted by the parameter $\\lambda$, is constant throughout the entire observation period. In other words, the probability of an event occurring within a small time interval of a given duration is the same, regardless of when that interval occurs.\n\nA data scientist is evaluating several real-world phenomena to determine if they can be appropriately modeled by a standard homogeneous Poisson process. Which of the following phenomena most directly and significantly violates the stationarity postulate?\n\nA. The number of alpha particles detected by a Geiger counter from a small, stable radioactive source of Polonium-210 over a period of 60 seconds.\n\nB. The number of customer service emails received by a major e-commerce company, with the observation period being one full calendar year.\n\nC. The number of buses arriving at a specific city bus stop over a 24-hour period, where the city's transit authority schedules buses to arrive exactly every 15 minutes.\n\nD. The number of times a specific server in a large, stable data center fails, assuming failures are independent and the hardware does not age significantly over the observation period of several months.", "solution": "For a standard homogeneous Poisson process with constant rate parameter $\\lambda$, the stationarity postulate requires that increments be stationary: for any start time $s$ and interval length $h>0$, the distribution of the increment $N(s+h)-N(s)$ depends only on $h$, not on $s$. Equivalently, for small $h$, $P(N(s+h)-N(s)=1)\\approx \\lambda h$ and $P(N(s+h)-N(s)\\ge 2)=o(h)$.\n\nEvaluate each option against this requirement:\n\nA. Radioactive decay from a small, stable Polonium-210 source over 60 seconds. Radioactive decays are well modeled by a Poisson process when the source is stable over the observation window. Given the half-life is very long relative to $60$ seconds, the effective rate $\\lambda$ is constant over the window, so $P(N(s+h)-N(s)=k)$ does not depend on $s$. This does not violate stationarity.\n\nB. Customer service emails over a full calendar year. The arrival rate inherently varies with time-of-day, day-of-week, and season (holidays, promotions), so the effective rate is $\\lambda(t)$, not a constant $\\lambda$. Hence $P(N(s+h)-N(s)=k)$ depends on $s$ (morning versus night, weekday versus weekend, holiday seasons), directly violating the stationarity postulate. This is a clear and substantial nonstationarity.\n\nC. Buses scheduled exactly every $15$ minutes. Arrivals are deterministic with fixed interarrival times, not random. For a small interval of length $h$, $P(N(s+h)-N(s)=1)$ depends drastically on whether $s$ aligns with a scheduled arrival; it is near zero for most $s$ and near one in a tiny neighborhood of schedule times. Thus the small-interval event probability depends on $s$, so stationarity is violated. However, this setting primarily fails because arrivals are not random and interarrivals are not exponential; the central violation is of the Poisson randomness assumptions more broadly, not merely time variation of a rate parameter.\n\nD. Server failures that are independent with negligible aging over several months. With no aging effect, the failure rate can be treated as approximately constant $\\lambda$, so increments are stationary. This does not violate stationarity.\n\nAmong the phenomena, both B and C fail the stationarity condition, but B most directly and significantly violates the stationarity postulate in the sense emphasized in the statementâ€”namely, a time-varying average rate across the observation period. In C, the chief issue is deterministic scheduling and non-Poisson interarrival structure, whereas B exemplifies the precise nonstationary behavior (time-varying $\\lambda$) that the postulate forbids.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1324213"}, {"introduction": "Another fundamental assumption is the independence of increments, meaning that the number of events in one interval has no influence on the number of events in any other non-overlapping interval.

The scientist proposes to model the number of cracks, $N(x)$, that appear along the first $x$ meters of the fiber as a Poisson process. However, further experiments reveal a critical phenomenon: if a segment of the fiber from length $L_1$ to $L_2$ accumulates a significant number of cracks, the material in the adjacent segment from $L_2$ to $L_3$ becomes more brittle. Consequently, the probability of new cracks forming in the segment $[L_2, L_3]$ increases if the number of cracks in the segment $[L_1, L_2]$ is high.\n\nAssuming this experimental observation is correct, which of the fundamental properties required for a counting process to be a Poisson process is directly violated?\n\nA.
