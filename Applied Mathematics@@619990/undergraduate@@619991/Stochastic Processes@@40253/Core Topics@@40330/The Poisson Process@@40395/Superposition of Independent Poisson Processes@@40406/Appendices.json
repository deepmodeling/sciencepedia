However, to prevent critical data corruption, the system is designed to trigger an emergency shutdown as soon as the cumulative number of errors from both Source A and Source B combined reaches a predefined integer threshold, $k$.\n\nAssuming the system starts in a perfect state at time $t=0$, determine the probability that exactly $n$ errors (where $n$ is an integer such that $0 \\le n \\le k$) originated from Source A at the precise moment the system shuts down.

This practice is valuable as it demonstrates how to calculate probabilities based on spatial relationships and reinforces the superposition principle in a more complex, geometric context.", "problem": "In an advanced semiconductor fabrication process, two types of microscopic point defects, designated as type A and type B, can occur on the surface of a silicon wafer. The locations of these defects are well-modeled by two independent, homogeneous two-dimensional spatial Poisson point processes. The process for type A defects has a constant intensity of $\\lambda_A$ defects per unit area, and the process for type B defects has an intensity of $\\lambda_B$ defects per unit area.\n\nAn automated optical inspection tool is used to scan the wafer and classify these defects. However, the tool's classification algorithm has specific limitations based on the proximity of other defects. The rules for successful identification are as follows:\n- A defect of type A is successfully identified if and only if there are no other type A defects within a radius $R_A$ and no type B defects within a radius $R_B$ of its location.\n- A defect of type B is successfully identified if and only if there are no other defects of *any* type (A or B) within a radius $R_C$ of its location.\n\nConsider a defect that is selected uniformly at random from the entire population of defects on a very large wafer. Calculate the probability that this chosen defect will be successfully identified by the inspection tool. Your answer should be a symbolic expression in terms of the given parameters $\\lambda_A$, $\\lambda_B$, $R_A$, $R_B$, and $R_C$.", "solution": "Let $I$ be the event that a randomly chosen defect is successfully identified. The problem asks for the probability $P(I)$. A randomly chosen defect can be either type A or type B. Let $T_A$ be the event that the chosen defect is of type A, and $T_B$ be the event that it is of type B. By the law of total probability, we can write:\n$$P(I) = P(I | T_A) P(T_A) + P(I | T_B) P(T_B)$$\n\nFirst, we determine the probabilities $P(T_A)$ and $P(T_B)$. For a very large area $S$, the expected number of type A defects is $N_A = \\lambda_A S$ and the expected number of type B defects is $N_B = \\lambda_B S$. The total expected number of defects is $N_{total} = N_A + N_B = (\\lambda_A + \\lambda_B)S$. The probability of a randomly selected defect being of type A is the ratio of the number of type A defects to the total number of defects, which in the limit of a large area becomes the ratio of their intensities.\n$$P(T_A) = \\frac{\\lambda_A S}{(\\lambda_A + \\lambda_B)S} = \\frac{\\lambda_A}{\\lambda_A + \\lambda_B}$$\nSimilarly,\n$$P(T_B) = \\frac{\\lambda_B S}{(\\lambda_A + \\lambda_B)S} = \\frac{\\lambda_B}{\\lambda_A + \\lambda_B}$$\n\nNext, we need to find the conditional probabilities $P(I | T_A)$ and $P(I | T_B)$. This involves the properties of Poisson point processes. A key property (often related to Slivnyak's theorem or the Palm distribution) is that conditioning on the existence of a process point at a certain location does not change the statistical distribution of all other points in the process.\n\nLet's calculate $P(I | T_A)$. This is the probability that a type A defect is identifiable. Let's assume this \"typical\" type A defect is located at the origin. For it to be identified, two conditions must be met:\n1.  There are no *other* type A defects in the disk of radius $R_A$ centered at the origin. The area of this disk is $\\pi R_A^2$. The number of other type A defects in this area follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu_{A_1} = \\lambda_A \\pi R_A^2$. The probability of having zero such defects is $P_1 = \\exp(-\\mu_{A_1}) = \\exp(-\\lambda_A \\pi R_A^2)$.\n2.  There are no type B defects in the disk of radius $R_B$ centered at the origin. The area is $\\pi R_B^2$. The number of type B defects in this area follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu_{A_2} = \\lambda_B \\pi R_B^2$. The probability of having zero such defects is $P_2 = \\exp(-\\mu_{A_2}) = \\exp(-\\lambda_B \\pi R_B^2)$.\n\nSince the two Poisson processes (for type A and type B defects) are independent, the events of these two disks being empty are independent. Therefore, we can multiply their probabilities:\n$$P(I | T_A) = P_1 \\times P_2 = \\exp(-\\lambda_A \\pi R_A^2) \\exp(-\\lambda_B \\pi R_B^2) = \\exp(-\\pi(\\lambda_A R_A^2 + \\lambda_B R_B^2))$$\n\nNow let's calculate $P(I | T_B)$. This is the probability that a type B defect is identifiable. We place this typical type B defect at the origin. For it to be identified, there must be no *other* defects of any type (A or B) within a radius $R_C$.\nBy the superposition property of independent Poisson processes, the combined process of all defects (type A and type B) is itself a Poisson process with intensity $\\lambda_{total} = \\lambda_A + \\lambda_B$.\nWhen we condition on a type B defect being at the origin, the distribution of all *other* defects (both A and B) remains a Poisson process with intensity $\\lambda_{total}$.\nWe need the disk of radius $R_C$ centered at the origin to be empty of these other defects. The area of this disk is $\\pi R_C^2$. The number of other defects in this area follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu_B = \\lambda_{total} \\pi R_C^2 = (\\lambda_A + \\lambda_B) \\pi R_C^2$.\nThe probability of having zero defects in this region is:\n$$P(I | T_B) = \\exp(-\\mu_B) = \\exp(-(\\lambda_A + \\lambda_B) \\pi R_C^2)$$\n\nFinally, we substitute these expressions back into the law of total probability:\n$$P(I) = P(I | T_A) P(T_A) + P(I | T_B) P(T_B)$$\n$$P(I) = \\exp(-\\pi(\\lambda_A R_A^2 + \\lambda_B R_B^2)) \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_A}{\\lambda_A + \\lambda_B}\\right) + \\exp(-(\\lambda_A + \\lambda_B) \\pi R_C^2) \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_B}{\\lambda_A + \\lambda_B}\\right)$$\nCombining the terms over a common denominator gives the final expression for the probability:\n$$P(I) = \\frac{\\lambda_A \\exp(-\\pi(\\lambda_A R_A^2 + \\lambda_B R_B^2)) + \\lambda_B \\exp(-\\pi(\\lambda_A + \\lambda_B) R_C^2)}{\\lambda_A + \\lambda_B}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\lambda_A \\exp(-\\pi(\\lambda_A R_A^2 + \\lambda_B R_B^2)) + \\lambda_B \\exp(-\\pi(\\lambda_A + \\lambda_B) R_C^2)}{\\lambda_A + \\lambda_B}}$$", "id": "1335979"}, {"introduction": "This final challenge moves into more advanced territory by introducing memory into the system.
