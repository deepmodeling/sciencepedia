{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The first step in analyzing a stochastic process is often translating a real-world scenario into a mathematical model. This exercise provides practical experience in this crucial skill by asking you to construct a transition matrix from a description of a student's daily choices. By mapping qualitative behaviors to quantitative probabilities, you will learn how to formalize a dynamic system into the structure of a Markov chain [@problem_id:1345028].", "problem": "A university student's daily coffee choice can be modeled as a discrete-time stochastic process. The student chooses between three coffee shops on campus: \"The Daily Grind,\" \"Bean Scene,\" and \"Cafe Diem.\" We will define the state space of this process as {$1, 2, 3$}, corresponding to the student visiting The Daily Grind, Bean Scene, and Cafe Diem, respectively.\n\nThe student's daily switching behavior is as follows:\n- If the student visits The Daily Grind (State 1) on a given day, there is a 50% chance they will return to The Daily Grind the next day, a 30% chance they will switch to Bean Scene, and a 20% chance they will switch to Cafe Diem.\n- If the student visits Bean Scene (State 2) on a given day, there is a 10% chance they will switch to The Daily Grind the next day and a 60% chance they will switch to Cafe Diem. They will otherwise return to Bean Scene.\n- If the student visits Cafe Diem (State 3) on a given day, they never return to Cafe Diem on the following day. Instead, they are equally likely to switch to The Daily Grind or Bean Scene.\n\nConstruct the one-step transition probability matrix $P$ for this Markov chain. The matrix element $P_{ij}$ should represent the probability of transitioning from state $i$ to state $j$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the one-step transition probability matrix $P$ for a Markov chain with three states. The state space is $S = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, where State 1 is \"The Daily Grind,\" State 2 is \"Bean Scene,\" and State 3 is \"Cafe Diem.\"\n\nThe transition matrix $P$ is a $3 \\times 3$ matrix where the entry in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column, denoted $P_{ij}$, is the probability of moving from state $i$ to state $j$ in one step. That is, $P_{ij} = P(X_{n+1}=j | X_n=i)$. A key property of any transition matrix is that the sum of the probabilities in each row must equal 1, since from any given state, the process must transition to some state in the state space.\n\nWe will construct the matrix row by row.\n\n**Row 1: Transitions from State 1 (The Daily Grind)**\nThe problem states that if the student is in State 1:\n- The probability of returning to The Daily Grind (State 1) is 50%. So, $P_{11} = 0.50$.\n- The probability of switching to Bean Scene (State 2) is 30%. So, $P_{12} = 0.30$.\n- The probability of switching to Cafe Diem (State 3) is 20%. So, $P_{13} = 0.20$.\nLet's check the sum of the row: $0.50 + 0.30 + 0.20 = 1.00$. This is correct.\nSo, the first row of $P$ is $[0.50, 0.30, 0.20]$.\n\n**Row 2: Transitions from State 2 (Bean Scene)**\nThe problem states that if the student is in State 2:\n- The probability of switching to The Daily Grind (State 1) is 10%. So, $P_{21} = 0.10$.\n- The probability of switching to Cafe Diem (State 3) is 60%. So, $P_{23} = 0.60$.\n- The problem states they will \"otherwise return to Bean Scene.\" This means the remaining probability corresponds to staying in State 2. Since the sum of each row must be 1, we can calculate $P_{22}$:\n$P_{22} = 1 - P_{21} - P_{23} = 1 - 0.10 - 0.60 = 0.30$.\nLet's check the sum of the row: $0.10 + 0.30 + 0.60 = 1.00$. This is correct.\nSo, the second row of $P$ is $[0.10, 0.30, 0.60]$.\n\n**Row 3: Transitions from State 3 (Cafe Diem)**\nThe problem states that if the student is in State 3:\n- They never return to Cafe Diem (State 3) on the following day. This means the probability of transitioning from State 3 to State 3 is 0. So, $P_{33} = 0$.\n- They are \"equally likely to switch to The Daily Grind or Bean Scene.\" The total probability for this row must sum to 1. The probability of moving to a state other than State 3 is $1 - P_{33} = 1 - 0 = 1$. This remaining probability is split equally between State 1 and State 2.\n- The probability of switching to The Daily Grind (State 1) is $P_{31} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.50$.\n- The probability of switching to Bean Scene (State 2) is $P_{32} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.50$.\nLet's check the sum of the row: $0.50 + 0.50 + 0 = 1.00$. This is correct.\nSo, the third row of $P$ is $[0.50, 0.50, 0]$.\n\nCombining these rows, we get the complete transition matrix $P$:\n$$\nP = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0.50 & 0.30 & 0.20 \\\\\n0.10 & 0.30 & 0.60 \\\\\n0.50 & 0.50 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWriting the entries as decimals is conventional.\n$$\nP = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0.5 & 0.3 & 0.2 \\\\\n0.1 & 0.3 & 0.6 \\\\\n0.5 & 0.5 & 0.0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.5 & 0.3 & 0.2 \\\\\n0.1 & 0.3 & 0.6 \\\\\n0.5 & 0.5 & 0.0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "1345028"}, {"introduction": "For a matrix to represent valid transitions in a Markov chain, it must obey strict mathematical rules.
