One of the operational states is the 'Computation' state, during which the server executes a complex numerical simulation. The time the server spends in the 'Computation' state before transitioning to another state (such as 'Data I/O' or 'Idle') is called the holding time for that state. A core property of a CTMC is that this holding time is an exponentially distributed random variable.\n\nSystem logs indicate that the probability of a server remaining in the 'Computation' state for more than 0.25 minutes is precisely $e^{-1.5}$. Based on this information, determine the total rate at which the server leaves the 'Computation' state. Express your answer in units of events per minute.", "solution": "Let $T$ denote the holding time in the 'Computation' state. For a CTMC, the holding time in a state is exponentially distributed with rate $\\lambda$, so the survival function is\n$$\n\\Pr(T>t)=\\exp(-\\lambda t), \\quad t\\ge 0.\n$$\nGiven $\\Pr(T>0.25)=\\exp(-1.5)$, we have\n$$\n\\exp(-\\lambda \\cdot 0.25)=\\exp(-1.5).\n$$\nSince the exponential function is injective, this implies\n$$\n-\\lambda \\cdot 0.25=-1.5.\n$$\nSolving for $\\lambda$ yields\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{1.5}{0.25}=6.\n$$\nBecause time $t$ is measured in minutes, the rate $\\lambda$ is in events per minute.
