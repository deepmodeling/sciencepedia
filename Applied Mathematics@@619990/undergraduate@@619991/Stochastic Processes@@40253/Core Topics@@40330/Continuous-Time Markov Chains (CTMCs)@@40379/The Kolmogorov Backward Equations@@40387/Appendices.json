The component transitions from the 'Operational' state to the 'Failed' state at a constant rate $\\lambda > 0$. Once the component has failed, it remains in the 'Failed' state indefinitely. This physical scenario can be modeled as a continuous-time Markov process.\n\nThe dynamics of this process are governed by the transition rates $q_{ij}$, which denote the instantaneous rate of transition from state $i$ to state $j$. For this specific component, the only non-zero off-diagonal transition rate is $q_{01} = \\lambda$. Let $P_{ij}(t)$ represent the probability that the component is in state $j$ at time $t$, given it was in state $i$ at time $t=0$.\n\nThe evolution of these transition probabilities is described by the Kolmogorov backward equations, given in matrix form as $\\frac{d}{dt}P(t) = Q P(t)$. Here, $P(t)$ is the matrix of transition probabilities $[P_{ij}(t)]$ and $Q$ is the generator matrix with elements $[q_{ij}]$. The diagonal elements of the generator matrix are defined by the relation $q_{ii} = - \\sum_{j \\neq i} q_{ij}$.\n\nGiven this system, which of the following functions correctly represents the probability $P_{00}(t)$?
