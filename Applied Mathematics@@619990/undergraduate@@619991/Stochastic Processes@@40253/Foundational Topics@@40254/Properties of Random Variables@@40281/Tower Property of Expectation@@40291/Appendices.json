Let $X_i$ be the random variable representing the payout in the $i$-th round of the second stage, for $i=1, 2, \\dots, N$. The total winnings, $Y$, can be expressed as the sum of the payouts from the $N$ rounds:\n$$Y = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$$\nWe understand that if $N=0$, the sum is empty, and $Y=0$. We wish to compute the expected value of $Y$, which is $\\mathbb{E}[Y]$.\n\nTo solve this, we use the law of total expectation, also known as the tower property, which states that $\\mathbb{E}[Y] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[Y|N]]$. We will compute this in two steps: first, the inner conditional expectation $\\mathbb{E}[Y|N]$, and second, the outer expectation.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the conditional expectation $\\mathbb{E}[Y|N]$.**\nWe condition on the event that the number of heads is a specific value, $N=n$. The total winnings are then the sum of $n$ random payouts:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[Y|N=n] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \\bigg| N=n\\right]$$\nSince the die rolls $X_i$ are independent of the coin flips (and thus of $N$), the conditioning on $N=n$ only determines the number of terms in the sum.

This probability $p$ is constant for all $N$ steps of a given random walk experiment. However, for each new experiment, the value of $p$ is itself determined by drawing it from a random distribution.
