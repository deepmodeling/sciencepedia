Understanding how to find the median of a discrete set of observations is the first step in characterizing the central tendency of a stochastic process. Unlike the mean, the median is less affected by extreme values, making it a robust and reliable measure in many real-world scenarios, such as analyzing network latency [@problem_id:1329200].", "problem": "A network engineer is analyzing the performance of a new routing algorithm by measuring the round-trip time (latency) for a series of data packets.
