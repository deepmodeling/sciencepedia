Nonnegativity holds because for any $A \\subseteq \\Omega$, each term $i^{2}$ is nonnegative and the factor $\\frac{1}{14}$ is positive, hence $P(A) \\geq 0$.\n\nNext, normalization: \n$$\nP(\\Omega) = \\frac{1}{14} \\sum_{i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}} i^{2} = \\frac{1}{14} \\left(1^{2} + 2^{2} + 3^{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{14} \\cdot 14 = 1.\n$$\nThus $P(\\Omega) = 1$.\n\nFinally, countable additivity for disjoint events holds.
