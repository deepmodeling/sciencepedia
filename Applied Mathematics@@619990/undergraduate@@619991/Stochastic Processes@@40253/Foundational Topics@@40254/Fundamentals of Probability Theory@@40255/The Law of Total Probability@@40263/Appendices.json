This first exercise provides a classic scenario to practice this skill. We will determine the probability of an event (drawing a queen) by first considering the different situations, or partitions, that could lead to itâ€”in this case, which of two possible decks of cards is being used. [@problem_id:10080]", "problem": "Two types of card decks are used in an experiment: a standard deck and a pinochle deck.\n- A **standard deck** consists of 52 cards, with 4 suits and 13 ranks (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace). It contains a total of 4 queen cards.\n- A **pinochle deck** consists of 48 cards. It is formed by taking two of each card from 9 to Ace (9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace) for each of the four suits. It contains a total of 8 queen cards.\n\nAn experimenter chooses one of the two decks based on the outcome of a single toss of a biased coin. If the coin shows heads, the standard deck is chosen. If it shows tails, the pinochle deck is chosen. The probability of the coin landing on heads is given by the symbol $p$.\n\nAfter a deck has been selected, one card is drawn uniformly at random from it. Using the law of total probability, derive a symbolic expression for the total probability of drawing a queen.", "solution": "Let $A$ be the event that the drawn card is a queen.\nLet $B_S$ be the event that the standard deck is chosen.\nLet $B_P$ be the event that the pinochle deck is chosen.\n\nThe events $B_S$ and $B_P$ form a partition of the sample space, as one and only one of them must occur. The problem states that the deck is chosen based on a coin toss where the probability of heads (choosing the standard deck) is $p$. Therefore, the probabilities of these events are:\n$$\nP(B_S) = p\n$$\n$$\nP(B_P) = 1 - p\n$$\n\nNext, we need to determine the conditional probabilities of drawing a queen, given that a particular deck has been chosen.\n\nFor the standard deck, there are 4 queens in a total of 52 cards.
