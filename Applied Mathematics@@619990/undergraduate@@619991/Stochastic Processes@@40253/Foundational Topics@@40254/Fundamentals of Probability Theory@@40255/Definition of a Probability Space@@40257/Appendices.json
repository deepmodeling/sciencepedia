A collection of 'distinguishable' events (which are subsets of $\\Omega$) is being constructed for data analysis. For this collection to be valid, it must satisfy three fundamental rules:\n\n1.  The 'certain event' $\\Omega$ must be in the collection.\n2.  If an event $E$ is in the collection, then the event that $E$ does not occur (its complement, $\\Omega \\setminus E$) must also be in the collection.\n3.  If any two events $E_1$ and $E_2$ are in the collection, then the event that at least one of them occurs (their union, $E_1 \\cup E_2$) must also be in the collection.\n\nSuppose we mandate that the event $A = \\{2, 4, 6\\}$ (the outcome is even) and the event $B = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ (the outcome is less than 4) must both be in the collection.

A collection satisfying the three rules is a field (Boolean algebra) of subsets of $\\Omega$: it contains $\\Omega$, is closed under complements (relative to $\\Omega$), and under finite unions (by induction from closure under binary unions). The smallest such collection containing $A$ and $B$ is the field generated by $A$ and $B$.\n\nFor two generating sets $A$ and $B$, the field they generate is the set of all unions of the four basic regions (atoms) determined by $A$ and $B$, namely the nonempty sets among\n$$\nA\\cap B,\\quad A\\cap B^{c},\\quad A^{c}\\cap B,\\quad A^{c}\\cap B^{c}.\n$$\nFirst compute these intersections using $B^{c}=\\{4,5,6\\}$ and $A^{c}=\\{1,3,5\\}$:\n$$\nA\\cap B=\\{2\\},\\quad A\\cap B^{c}=\\{4,6\\},\\quad A^{c}\\cap B=\\{1,3\\},\\quad A^{c}\\cap B^{c}=\\{5\\}.\n$$\nAll four regions are nonempty, so they form a partition of $\\Omega$ into $m=4$ atoms.\n\nBy De Morganâ€™s laws and closure properties, each atom belongs to any collection containing $A$ and $B$ that is closed under complements and unions; for example,\n$$\nA\\cap B = (A^{c}\\cup B^{c})^{c},\\quad A\\cap B^{c} = (A^{c}\\cup B)^{c},\\quad A^{c}\\cap B = (A\\cup B^{c})^{c},\\quad A^{c}\\cap B^{c} = (A\\cup B)^{c}.\n$$\nOnce the atoms are included, closure under unions forces the collection to contain every union of these atoms. Therefore the smallest such collection has exactly $2^{m}$ sets, where $m$ is the number of atoms.
