Choose a line segment $L \\subset W$ and parametrize $p_{1}(t)$ along $L$ by $t \\in (0,1)$. For $t \\ne s$, the perpendicular bisectors of $p_{1}(t)$ and $p_{2}$, and of $p_{1}(s)$ and $p_{2}$, are distinct parallel lines with distinct midpoints, hence the corresponding shared Voronoi edge between the cells of $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ lies in a different location in $U$.
