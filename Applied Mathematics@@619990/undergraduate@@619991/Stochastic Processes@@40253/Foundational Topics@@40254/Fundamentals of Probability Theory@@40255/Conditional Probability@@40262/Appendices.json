Let $A$ be the event that a randomly selected microchip fails Test A, and let $B$ be the event that it fails Test B. The probabilities associated with these tests are given as follows:\n\n- The probability that a chip fails Test A is $P(A) = p_A$.\n- The probability that a chip fails Test B is $P(B) = p_B$.\n- The probability that a chip fails Test A, given that it has already failed Test B, is $P(A|B) = p_{A|B}$.\n\nAssume the following values for the probabilities:\n- $p_A = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- $p_B = \\frac{2}{5}$\n- $p_{A|B} = \\frac{3}{5}$\n\nUsing the fundamental definition of conditional probability, derive an expression for $P(B|A)$, the probability that a microchip fails Test B given that it has failed Test A.

The definition of conditional probability for two events, $X$ and $Y$ (with $P(Y)>0$), is given by:\n$$\nP(X|Y) = \\frac{P(X \\cap Y)}{P(Y)}\n$$\nwhere $P(X \\cap Y)$ is the joint probability that both events $X$ and $Y$ occur.\n\nOur goal is to find $P(B|A)$. Using the definition, we can write:\n$$\nP(B|A) = \\frac{P(B \\cap A)}{P(A)}\n$$\n\nThe problem provides $P(A)$ but does not directly provide the joint probability $P(B \\cap A)$. However, we are given $P(A|B)$ and $P(B)$. We can use the definition of conditional probability for $P(A|B)$:\n$$\nP(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\n$$\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the joint probability $P(A \\cap B)$:\n$$\nP(A \\cap B) = P(A|B) P(B)\n$$\n\nThe intersection of events is a symmetric operation, meaning the event \"A and B occur\" is the same as the event \"B and A occur\". Therefore, their probabilities are equal:\n$$\nP(A \\cap B) = P(B \\cap A)\n$$\n\nNow we can substitute the expression for $P(A \\cap B)$ from the rearranged formula into our equation for $P(B|A)$:\n$$\nP(B|A) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(A)} = \\frac{P(A|B) P(B)}{P(A)}\n$$\n\nThis gives us the symbolic expression for $P(B|A)$ in terms of the given quantities.

We can rearrange the definition of conditional probability for $P(D|A)$:\n$$\nP(D|A) = \\frac{P(D \\cap A)}{P(A)}\n$$\nSolving for $P(D \\cap A)$, which is the same as $P(A \\cap D)$, we get:\n$$\nP(A \\cap D) = P(D|A) P(A)\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nP(A \\cap D) = d_A p_A\n$$\n\nNext, let's find the denominator, $P(D)$. A microchip can be defective in two mutually exclusive ways: it was produced by Line A and is defective, or it was produced by Line B and is defective. Using the law of total probability, we can express $P(D)$ as the sum of these possibilities:\n$$\nP(D) = P(D \\cap A) + P(D \\cap B)\n$$\nWe have already found $P(D \\cap A) = d_A p_A$.
