This first exercise provides a fundamental look at how the joint probability mass function of two new variables, derived from a pair of simple, independent random signals, can be constructed.

The system then computes two new parameters from these signals: their sum, $S = X + Y$, and their absolute difference, $D = |X - Y|$.\n\nAn analyst is interested in the joint statistical properties of $S$ and $D$. Calculate the value of the joint probability mass function $P(S=s, D=d)$ for the specific case where the sum is $s=7$ and the absolute difference is $d=3$.\n\nProvide your answer as an exact fraction.", "solution": "Let the two independent random variables be $X$ and $Y$. Both variables are drawn from a discrete uniform distribution over the set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. The size of this set is $|\\mathcal{A}| = 5$.\n\nSince $X$ and $Y$ are independent and uniformly distributed on $\\mathcal{A}$, the probability of $X$ taking any specific value $x \\in \\mathcal{A}$ is $P(X=x) = \\frac{1}{5}$.

The total number of possible outcomes is $5 \\times 5 = 25$. Due to the independence of $X$ and $Y$, the probability of any specific pair $(x, y)$ occurring is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(X=x, Y=y) = P(X=x) P(Y=y) = \\frac{1}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{25}$$\nEach of the 25 pairs is equally likely.\n\nWe are asked to find the probability of the joint event where the sum $S = X + Y$ is 7 and the absolute difference $D = |X - Y|$ is 3. We need to find all pairs $(x, y)$ from the sample space that simultaneously satisfy these two conditions:\n1. $x + y = 7$\n2. $|x - y| = 3$\n\nLet's analyze the second condition, $|x-y|=3$. This implies two possibilities:\n- Case A: $x - y = 3$, which means $x = y + 3$.\n- Case B: $x - y = -3$, which means $y = x + 3$.\n\nWe can now substitute these into the first condition, $x + y = 7$.\n\nFor Case A ($x = y + 3$):\nSubstitute $x$ in the sum equation:\n$(y + 3) + y = 7$\n$2y + 3 = 7$\n$2y = 4$\n$y = 2$\nNow, find the corresponding value of $x$:\n$x = y + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5$\nThis gives us the pair $(x, y) = (5, 2)$. We must verify that both $x=5$ and $y=2$ are in the set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. They are, so $(5, 2)$ is a valid outcome.\n\nFor Case B ($y = x + 3$):\nSubstitute $y$ in the sum equation:\n$x + (x + 3) = 7$\n$2x + 3 = 7$\n$2x = 4$\n$x = 2$\nNow, find the corresponding value of $y$:\n$y = x + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5$\nThis gives us the pair $(x, y) = (2, 5)$. We must verify that both $x=2$ and $y=5$ are in the set $\\mathcal{A}$.
