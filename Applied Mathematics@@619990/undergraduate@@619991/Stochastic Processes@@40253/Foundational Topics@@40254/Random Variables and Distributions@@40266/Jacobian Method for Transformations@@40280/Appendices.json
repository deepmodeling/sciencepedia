We introduce a second transformation to create a one-to-one mapping from $(X, Y)$ to a new pair of variables $(M, U)$. Let's define the transformation as:\n$$ M = \\frac{Y}{X} $$\n$$ U = X $$\n\nNext, we find the inverse transformation by expressing $X$ and $Y$ in terms of $M$ and $U$:\n$$ X = U $$\n$$ Y = MU $$\n\nNow, we compute the Jacobian of this inverse transformation. The Jacobian determinant, $J$, is given by:\n$$ J = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial m} & \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial u} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial m} & \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u} \\end{pmatrix} = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ u & m \\end{pmatrix} = (0)(m) - (1)(u) = -u $$\nThe absolute value of the Jacobian is $|J| = |-u| = u$. We need $u \\ge 0$ for this to be non-trivial, which is satisfied as $X=U$ and $X \\in [0,1]$.\n\nThe joint PDF of the new variables, $M$ and $U$, is given by the formula $f_{M,U}(m, u) = f_{X,Y}(x(m,u), y(m,u)) |J|$. Substituting the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $|J|$:\n$$ f_{M,U}(m, u) = f_{X,Y}(u, mu) \\cdot u $$\n\nTo evaluate this, we need to determine the support (the region where the PDF is non-zero) for $(M,U)$. The support for $(X,Y)$ is the unit square $0 \\le x \\le 1$ and $0 \\le y \\le 1$. We transform these inequalities into inequalities for $m$ and $u$:\n1.  $0 \\le x \\le 1 \\implies 0 \\le u \\le 1$.\n2.  $0 \\le y \\le 1 \\implies 0 \\le mu \\le 1$.\n\nSince $u=x>0$ and $y \\ge 0$, the slope $m=y/x$ must be non-negative, so $m \\ge 0$.\nThe condition $mu \\le 1$, since $u>0$, implies $u \\le 1/m$.\nCombining these, the support for $(M,U)$ is defined by $m \\ge 0$, $0 \\le u \\le 1$, and $0 \\le u \\le 1/m$.\nWithin this region, $f_{X,Y}(u, mu) = 1$. Therefore, the joint PDF for $M$ and $U$ is:\n$$ f_{M,U}(m, u) = 1 \\cdot u = u $$\nfor $m \\ge 0$ and $0 \\le u \\le \\min(1, 1/m)$, and $f_{M,U}(m, u) = 0$ otherwise.\n\nTo find the marginal PDF of $M$, $f_M(m)$, we integrate the joint PDF $f_{M,U}(m, u)$ with respect to $u$ over its support. The upper limit of integration for $u$ depends on $m$, so we must consider two cases.\n\nCase 1: $0 \\le m \\le 1$\nIn this case, $1/m \\ge 1$. The upper bound for $u$ is $\\min(1, 1/m) = 1$.\n$$ f_M(m) = \\int_0^1 f_{M,U}(m, u) \\, du = \\int_0^1 u \\, du = \\left[ \\frac{u^2}{2} \\right]_0^1 = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n\nCase 2: $m > 1$\nIn this case, $0 < 1/m < 1$.
