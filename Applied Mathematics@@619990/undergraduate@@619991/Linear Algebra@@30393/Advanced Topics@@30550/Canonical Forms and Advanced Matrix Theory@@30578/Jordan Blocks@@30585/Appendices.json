Specifically, the sizes of the Jordan blocks of $T$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ are identical to the sizes of the Jordan blocks of the nilpotent operator $N$ (which correspond to eigenvalue 0). Our goal is to find the sizes of the Jordan blocks of $N$.\n\nThe key information for determining the Jordan structure of a nilpotent operator is the sequence of nullities (dimensions of the kernels) of its powers. The nullity of a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space is related to its rank by the rank-nullity theorem:\n$\\dim(\\ker(L)) + \\text{rank}(L) = \\dim(V)$\nHere, the vector space $V$ has dimension $n=10$. Let $d_k = \\dim(\\ker(N^k))$ be the nullity of $N^k$.
