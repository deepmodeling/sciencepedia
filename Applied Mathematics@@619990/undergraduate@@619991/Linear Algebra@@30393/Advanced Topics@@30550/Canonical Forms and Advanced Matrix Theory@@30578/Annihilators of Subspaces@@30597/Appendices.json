We first need to determine the general form of a linear functional in the annihilator $W^0$, and then use the given normalization condition to find the unique functional $\\phi$.\n\nStep 1: Determine the general form of a functional in $W^0$.\nA linear functional $f$ on $V=\\mathbb{R}^3$ can be represented by the dot product with a fixed vector. That is, for any $f \\in (\\mathbb{R}^3)^*$, there exists a unique vector $f_{vec} = (\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ such that for any vector $w = (x, y, z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, the functional is evaluated as:\n$$f(w) = f(x, y, z) = \\alpha_1 x + \\alpha_2 y + \\alpha_3 z$$\nThe subspace $W$ is defined by the equation $a_1 x + a_2 y + a_3 z = 0$.\nFor a functional $f$ to be in the annihilator $W^0$, it must satisfy $f(w) = 0$ for all $w \\in W$. This means:\nIf $a_1 x + a_2 y + a_3 z = 0$, then it must follow that $\\alpha_1 x + \\alpha_2 y + \\alpha_3 z = 0$.\n\nGeometrically, the set of points satisfying $a_1 x + a_2 y + a_3 z = 0$ is a plane through the origin with normal vector $a = (a_1, a_2, a_3)$. Similarly, the kernel of the functional $f$ (where $f(w)=0$) is a plane with normal vector $f_{vec} = (\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3)$. For the kernel of $f$ to contain the plane $W$, the two planes must be identical. This occurs if and only if their normal vectors are parallel.\nTherefore, the vector $(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3)$ must be a scalar multiple of $(a_1, a_2, a_3)$. Let this scalar be $\\lambda$.\n$$(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3) = \\lambda (a_1, a_2, a_3)$$\nThus, any functional $\\phi \\in W^0$ must have the form:\n$$\\phi(x, y, z) = \\lambda(a_1 x + a_2 y + a_3 z)$$\nfor some scalar $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nStep 2: Use the normalization condition to find the specific scalar $\\lambda$ for $\\phi$.\nWe are given that $\\phi(v) = k$ for the vector $v = (c_1, c_2, c_3)$. We can substitute $v$ into the general form of $\\phi$:\n$$\\phi(v) = \\phi(c_1, c_2, c_3) = \\lambda(a_1 c_1 + a_2 c_2 + a_3 c_3)$$\nWe are given that this value equals $k$:\n$$\\lambda(a_1 c_1 + a_2 c_2 + a_3 c_3) = k$$\nSince $v \\notin W$, we know that $v$ does not satisfy the equation for the subspace $W$, which means $a_1 c_1 + a_2 c_2 + a_3 c_3 \\neq 0$. This allows us to solve for $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{k}{a_1 c_1 + a_2 c_2 + a_3 c_3}$$\n\nStep 3: Write the explicit form for $\\phi$ and evaluate it at $u$.\nNow we have the unique scalar $\\lambda$ that defines $\\phi$.
