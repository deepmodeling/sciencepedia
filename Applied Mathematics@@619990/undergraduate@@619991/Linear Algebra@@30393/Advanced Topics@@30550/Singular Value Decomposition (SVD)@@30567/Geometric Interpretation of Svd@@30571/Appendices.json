The transformation of the unit circle by the matrix $A$ generates a set of points $E = \\{A\\vec{x} \\mid \\vec{x} \\in C\\}$. We are tasked with finding the area of this set $E$, which is an ellipse.\n\nWe begin by using the Singular Value Decomposition of the matrix $A$:\n$$\nA = U\\Sigma V^T\n$$\nA point $\\mathbf{y}$ in the set $E$ is given by $\\mathbf{y} = A\\vec{x}$ for some $\\vec{x}$ on the unit circle.

Since $V$ is an orthogonal matrix, its transpose $V^T$ is also an orthogonal matrix. An orthogonal transformation is a rigid transformation (a rotation and/or a reflection) that preserves lengths (norms) of vectors.\nTherefore, the norm of $\\vec{x}'$ is the same as the norm of $\\vec{x}$:\n$$\n\\|\\vec{x}'\\| = \\|V^T \\vec{x}\\| = \\|\\vec{x}\\| = 1\n$$\nThis means that as the vector $\\vec{x}$ traces the entire unit circle $C$, the vector $\\vec{x}'$ also traces the entire unit circle.\n\n**Step 2: The action of $\\Sigma$**\nAfter the first transformation, our expression for $\\mathbf{y}$ becomes $\\mathbf{y} = U\\Sigma \\vec{x}'$. Let's define a second intermediate vector $\\mathbf{y}' = \\Sigma \\vec{x}'$. Since $\\vec{x}'$ is a vector on the unit circle, we can parameterize its components using an angle $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\vec{x}' = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\text{for } \\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)\n$$\nNow we apply the scaling transformation by the diagonal matrix $\\Sigma$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}' = \\Sigma \\vec{x}' = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sigma_2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_1 \\cos\\theta \\\\ \\sigma_2 \\sin\\theta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nLet the components of $\\mathbf{y}'$ be $y'_1$ and $y'_2$.
