By working through this problem for a simple path graph, you will gain a concrete understanding of how the Laplacian matrix measures the 'smoothness' of a function defined on the graph's vertices [@problem_id:1371396].", "problem": "In the field of spectral graph theory, the Laplacian matrix of a simple graph is a fundamental tool for analyzing its structure. For a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices labeled $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n$, its Laplacian matrix $L$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix defined as $L = D - A$. Here, $D$ is the degree matrix, which is a diagonal matrix where the entry $D_{ii}$ is the degree of vertex $v_i$, and $A$ is the adjacency matrix, where $A_{ij} = 1$ if there is an edge between vertices $v_i$ and $v_j$, and $A_{ij} = 0$ otherwise.\n\nConsider the path graph on three vertices, denoted as $P_3$.

The graph $P_3$ has three vertices $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$ and an edge set $E = \\{(v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3)\\}$. The process is broken down into several steps.\n\nFirst, we determine the degree of each vertex. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.\n- The degree of vertex $v_1$ is $\\deg(v_1) = 1$ (connected to $v_2$).\n- The degree of vertex $v_2$ is $\\deg(v_2) = 2$ (connected to $v_1$ and $v_3$).\n- The degree of vertex $v_3$ is $\\deg(v_3) = 1$ (connected to $v_2$).\n\nSecond, we construct the degree matrix $D$.

The entry $A_{ij}$ is 1 if there is an edge between vertex $v_i$ and vertex $v_j$, and 0 otherwise. For a simple graph, the diagonal entries $A_{ii}$ are always 0.\n- The edge $(v_1, v_2)$ implies $A_{12} = A_{21} = 1$.\n- The edge $(v_2, v_3)$ implies $A_{23} = A_{32} = 1$.\n- All other non-diagonal entries are 0.\nThis gives the adjacency matrix:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nFourth, we calculate the Laplacian matrix $L$ using its definition, $L = D - A$.\n$$\nL = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1-0 & 0-1 & 0-0 \\\\ 0-1 & 2-0 & 0-1 \\\\ 0-0 & 0-1 & 1-0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the quadratic form $x^T L x$ using the given vector $x = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.
