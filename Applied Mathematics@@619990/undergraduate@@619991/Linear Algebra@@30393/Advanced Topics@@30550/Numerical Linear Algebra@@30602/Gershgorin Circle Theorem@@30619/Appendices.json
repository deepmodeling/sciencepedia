Consider a system of four interacting nodes, whose dynamics are governed by a complex-valued $4 \\times 4$ matrix $A$. The eigenvalues of this matrix are crucial for understanding the system's behavior.\n\nA powerful theorem states that for any square matrix, all its eigenvalues are located in the union of a set of disks in the complex plane. For an $n \\times n$ matrix $M$, the $k$-th disk, $D_k$, is centered at the diagonal element $M_{kk}$ and has a radius equal to the sum of the absolute values of the off-diagonal elements in the $k$-th row ($R_k = \\sum_{j \\neq k} |M_{kj}|$).\n\nLet the matrix for our four-node system be:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n10 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n-1 & 20i & 1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & -1 & -10 & 1 \\\\\n-1 & 1 & -1 & -20i\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $i$ is the imaginary unit.\n\nBased on an analysis of the locations of the Gershgorin disks for matrix $A$, which of the following conclusions is definitively correct?\n\nA.

Hence $A$ is nonsingular, i.e., invertible. This definitively validates option D via Gershgorin analysis.\n\nWe now check why the other options are not definitively supported by Gershgorin disks:\n- A claims all eigenvalues have real part greater than $5$. However $D_{3}$ is centered at $-10$ with radius $3$, entirely contained in the half-plane with real part less than $-7$. Gershgorin allows eigenvalues to lie in $D_{3}$, so A cannot be concluded.\n- B claims at least one eigenvalue is pure imaginary. While $D_{2}$ and $D_{4}$ intersect the imaginary axis, Gershgorin does not guarantee any eigenvalue lies on that axis; it only guarantees inclusion in the disks. Thus B is not guaranteed.\n- C claims $A$ is singular. The disks exclude $0$, so C is false.\n- E claims the sum of eigenvalues is zero. Although $\\operatorname{tr}(A)=10+20i-10-20i=0$ implies the sum of eigenvalues is $0$, this conclusion follows from the trace property, not from Gershgorin disk analysis.

For an irreducible $2 \\times 2$ matrix (where $a_{12}$ and $a_{21}$ are non-zero), this means the eigenvector $v=(v_1, v_2)^T$ must satisfy $|v_1|=|v_2|$. This condition implies that the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ lies on the boundary of *both* disks.\n\nThe problem asks us to find $c$ such that an eigenvalue lies on the boundary of both disks, which directs us to look for an eigenvector with components of equal magnitude. Let this eigenvector be $v = \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix}$ where $|v_1| = |v_2|$. We can normalize this and write it as $v = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ u \\end{pmatrix}$ where $u$ is a complex number with $|u|=1$.\n\nThe eigenvalue equation is $Av = \\lambda v$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 5 & -3 \\\\ c & 9 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ u \\end{pmatrix} = \\lambda \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ u \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis yields a system of two equations:\n1) $5 - 3u = \\lambda$\n2) $c + 9u = \\lambda u$\n\nSubstitute $\\lambda$ from the first equation into the second:\n$$\nc + 9u = (5 - 3u)u\n$$\n$$\nc + 9u = 5u - 3u^2\n$$\nRearranging gives a quadratic equation for $u$:\n$$\n3u^2 + 4u + c = 0\n$$\nWe are looking for a solution $u$ that satisfies $|u|=1$. Since the matrix $A$ is real (as $c$ is specified to be real), the coefficients of this quadratic equation are real. If a complex number $u$ is a solution, its conjugate $\\bar{u}$ must also be a solution. If $|u|=1$ and $u$ is not real, then $u \\neq \\bar{u}$. A real quadratic can only have two solutions. If they are non-real, they must be a conjugate pair. Since $|u|=|\\bar{u}|=1$, this is possible. However, the simplest cases to check are when $u$ is real. If $u$ is real and $|u|=1$, then $u$ must be either $1$ or $-1$.\n\nCase 1: $u = 1$.\nSubstitute $u=1$ into the quadratic equation:\n$3(1)^2 + 4(1) + c = 0 \\implies 3 + 4 + c = 0 \\implies c = -7$.\nThis is a valid non-zero real value for $c$.\nWith $c=-7$, the eigenvector is $v = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe corresponding eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is found from the first equation: $\\lambda = 5 - 3u = 5 - 3(1) = 2$.\nLet's verify.
