The trace of $A(k)$ is exactly 1.\n2.  The determinant of $A(k)$ is positive.\n3.  The matrix $A(k)$ is indefinite.\n\nLet's address each condition step-by-step.\n\nFirst, we use the most restrictive condition, the specific value of the trace, to determine the value of $k$.\nThe trace of a square matrix is the sum of the elements on its main diagonal. For the given matrix $A(k)$, the trace is:\n$$\n\\text{Tr}(A(k)) = k + (-2) + (-2) = k - 4\n$$\nThe problem states that the trace must be equal to 1:\n$$\n\\text{Tr}(A(k)) = 1 \\implies k - 4 = 1 \\implies k = 5\n$$\nThis gives a unique integer value, $k=5$.

Since $D_2 = -11  0$, the matrix $A(5)$ is not positive definite.\n- A matrix is negative definite if and only if its leading principal minors alternate in sign, starting with a negative one ($D_1  0, D_2  0, D_3  0, \\dots$).
