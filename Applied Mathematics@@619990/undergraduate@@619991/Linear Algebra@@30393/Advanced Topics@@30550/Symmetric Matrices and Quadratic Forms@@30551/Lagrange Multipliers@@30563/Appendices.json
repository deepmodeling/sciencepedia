The energy consumption of the system is approximated by a linear function of its state components, given by $E(\\mathbf{s}) = s_1 + 2s_2 + 3s_3$. To operate the arm in its most energy-efficient configuration, it is necessary to find the state vector $\\mathbf{s}$ that minimizes this energy consumption.

The constraint is that $\\mathbf{s}$ must be a unit vector, which can be written as $s_1^2 + s_2^2 + s_3^2 = 1$. This is a constrained optimization problem that can be solved using the method of Lagrange multipliers.\n\nFirst, we define the objective function $f(s_1, s_2, s_3)$ and the constraint function $g(s_1, s_2, s_3)$.\nObjective function: $f(s_1, s_2, s_3) = s_1 + 2s_2 + 3s_3$.\nConstraint function: $g(s_1, s_2, s_3) = s_1^2 + s_2^2 + s_3^2 - 1 = 0$.\n\nThe method of Lagrange multipliers states that at an extremum, the gradient of the objective function must be proportional to the gradient of the constraint function. That is, $\\nabla f = \\lambda \\nabla g$ for some scalar $\\lambda$, known as the Lagrange multiplier.\n\nWe compute the gradients of $f$ and $g$:\nThe gradient of $f$ is:\n$$ \\nabla f = \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial s_1}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial s_2}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial s_3} \\right) = (1, 2, 3) $$\nThe gradient of $g$ is:\n$$ \\nabla g = \\left( \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial s_1}, \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial s_2}, \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial s_3} \\right) = (2s_1, 2s_2, 2s_3) $$\n\nNow, we set up the system of equations from $\\nabla f = \\lambda \\nabla g$:\n1.  $1 = \\lambda(2s_1)$\n2.  $2 = \\lambda(2s_2)$\n3.  $3 = \\lambda(2s_3)$\n\nWe also have the original constraint equation:\n4.  $s_1^2 + s_2^2 + s_3^2 = 1$\n\nFrom equations (1), (2), and (3), we can express $s_1, s_2,$ and $s_3$ in terms of $\\lambda$.
