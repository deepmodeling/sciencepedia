This implies that the operator $(T-I)$ is not the zero operator. If $(T-I)$ is not the zero operator, there must exist at least one vector $u \\in V$ such that $(T-I)u \\neq 0$.

Therefore:\n$$T(w) = T((T-I)u) = 0$$\n\nLet's verify this step-by-step using linearity as well:\n$$T(w) = T(T(u) - u)$$\n$$T(w) = T(T(u)) - T(u)$$\n$$T(w) = T^2(u) - T(u)$$\nUsing the given property $T^2 = T$, we have $T^2(u) = T(u)$.
