Yet, they often exhibit rotational or oscillatory behavior, which is elegantly described by complex eigenvalues. This first exercise provides foundational practice on the most important property of such systems: for any real matrix, its complex eigenvalues must appear in conjugate pairs. You will use this principle to determine a key invariant of the matrix—its determinant—which is crucial for analyzing the system's long-term behavior, such as whether it grows or shrinks over time [@problem_id:1354558].", "problem": "In the study of linear dynamical systems, the evolution of a state vector $\\mathbf{x}$ in a two-dimensional space is often described by the equation $\\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = A\\mathbf{x}_k$, where $A$ is a $2 \\times 2$ matrix with exclusively real entries. A crucial aspect of analyzing such a system is understanding its eigenvalues, which determine the stability and long-term behavior of the states.\n\nSuppose that for a particular system, experimental analysis reveals that the matrix $A$ has an eigenvalue of $\\lambda = 1 - 2i$. Based solely on this information, calculate the determinant of the matrix $A$.", "solution": "For any real $2 \\times 2$ matrix $A$, the characteristic polynomial has real coefficients. Therefore, if it has a non-real eigenvalue, its complex conjugate is also an eigenvalue. Given $\\lambda_{1} = 1 - 2i$ is an eigenvalue, the other eigenvalue must be $\\lambda_{2} = 1 + 2i$.\n\nFor any square matrix, the determinant equals the product of its eigenvalues (counted with algebraic multiplicity).

Just as a pair of complex conjugate numbers can be multiplied to produce a real number, a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues corresponds to a quadratic factor with real coefficients within the characteristic polynomial.
