We will use two fundamental properties of determinants.\n\n**Step 1: Apply the determinant of a product rule.**\nThe determinant of a product of two square matrices is the product of their individual determinants. For any two $n \\times n$ matrices $X$ and $Y$, this property is stated as:\n$$\n\\det(XY) = \\det(X)\\det(Y)\n$$\nApplying this rule to the expression $\\det(A^{-1}B)$, we can separate it into the product of two determinants:\n$$\n\\det(A^{-1}B) = \\det(A^{-1})\\det(B)\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Derive the expression for the determinant of an inverse matrix.**\nFor any invertible matrix $A$, its inverse $A^{-1}$ satisfies the property:\n$$\nA A^{-1} = I\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix.\n\nTaking the determinant of both sides of this equation gives:\n$$\n\\det(A A^{-1}) = \\det(I)\n$$\nUsing the product rule from Step 1 on the left side, we get:\n$$\n\\det(A)\\det(A^{-1}) = \\det(I)\n$$\nThe determinant of the identity matrix $\\det(I)$ is always $1$. So, the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\det(A)\\det(A^{-1}) = 1\n$$\nSince $A$ is invertible, we know that $\\det(A) \\neq 0$. Therefore, we can divide both sides by $\\det(A)$ to solve for $\\det(A^{-1})$:\n$$\n\\det(A^{-1}) = \\frac{1}{\\det(A)}\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results to find the general expression.**\nNow we substitute the result from Step 2 into the equation from Step 1:\n$$\n\\det(A^{-1}B) = \\det(A^{-1})\\det(B) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\det(A)}\\right) \\det(B)\n$$\nThis gives us the general expression for $\\det(A^{-1}B)$ in terms of $\\det(A)$ and $\\det(B)$:\n$$\n\\det(A^{-1}B) = \\frac{\\det(B)}{\\det(A)}\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the specific value.**\nWe are given the specific values $\\det(A) = 2$ and $\\det(B) = 6$.
