The model involves three specific enzymes, E1, E2, and E3, whose activity levels can be adjusted. Let the vector $x = (x_1, x_2, x_3)^T$ represent the change in concentration of these three enzymes. The activities of these enzymes influence the production rates of four key metabolites, M1, M2, M3, and M4. The relationship between the change in enzyme concentrations and the resulting change in metabolite production rates, represented by the vector $b = (b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4)^T$, is described by the linear transformation $b = Ax$, where $A$ is the interaction matrix:\n$$A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & -3 \\\\ 2 & -1 & -3 \\\\ -1 & 3 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 2 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe researchers are particularly interested in identifying \"homeostatic states\" — non-zero combinations of changes in enzyme concentrations that lead to no net change in the production rates of any of the four metabolites.
