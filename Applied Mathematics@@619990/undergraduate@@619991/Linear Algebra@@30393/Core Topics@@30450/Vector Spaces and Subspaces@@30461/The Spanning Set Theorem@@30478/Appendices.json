Here, $\\mathbf{v}_4$ is a linear combination of other vectors in $S$. To show this explicitly, consider any vector $\\mathbf{x}\\in H$. We can write it as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}=c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}+c_{3}\\mathbf{v}_{3}+c_{4}\\mathbf{v}_{4}.\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mathbf{v}_{4}$ gives:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}=c_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\\mathbf{v}_{2}+c_{3}\\mathbf{v}_{3}+c_{4}(a\\mathbf{v}_{1}+b\\mathbf{v}_{2}) = (c_{1}+ac_{4})\\mathbf{v}_{1}+(c_{2}+bc_{4})\\mathbf{v}_{2}+c_{3}\\mathbf{v}_{3}.\n$$\nThis shows that $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\operatorname{span}\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\}$.

The reverse inclusion, $\\operatorname{span}\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\} \\subseteq \\operatorname{span}(S)$, is immediate since $\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\}\\subset S$.

For instance, if $\\mathbf{v}_{4}=b\\,\\mathbf{v}_{2}$ with $b\\in\\mathbb{F}$ and $a=0$, and we assume $\\mathbf{v}_1$ is not a multiple of $\\mathbf{v}_2$, then\n$$\n\\operatorname{span}\\{\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\mathbf{v}_{3},\\mathbf{v}_{4}\\}=\\operatorname{span}\\{\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\}\\subsetneq \\operatorname{span}\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\mathbf{v}_{3}\\}=H,\n$$\nso removing $\\mathbf{v}_{1}$ can reduce the span.

Since any four vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ must be linearly dependent, at least one vector can be removed.\n\nFirst, test whether $\\mathbf{u}_{3}$ lies in the span of $\\{\\mathbf{u}_{1},\\mathbf{u}_{2}\\}$.
