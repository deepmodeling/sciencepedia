Here the ambient space is $P_{n}(\\mathbb{R})$ over the field $\\mathbb{R}$, and $W=\\{p \\in P_{n}(\\mathbb{R}) : p(0) \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\n\nFirst, the zero vector is in $W$ because the zero polynomial satisfies $0(0)=0$, and 0 is an integer. So, $0 \\in W$.\n\nSecond, if $p,q \\in W$, then $p(0)$ and $q(0)$ are integers. Their sum is $(p+q)(0)=p(0)+q(0)$, which is also an integer since the set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ is closed under addition. Hence $W$ is closed under vector addition.\n\nThird, for scalar multiplication, we must check for all scalars in $\\mathbb{R}$. Let $c$ be a real number that is not an integer (e.g., $c=0.5$). Choose a polynomial $p \\in W$ such that $p(0)=1$ (for instance, the constant polynomial $p(x)=1$). Then for the new polynomial $cp$, we have\n$$\n(cp)(0)=c \\cdot p(0)=c \\cdot 1 = c.\n$$\nSince we chose $c$ to be a non-integer, $(cp)(0)$ is not an integer.
