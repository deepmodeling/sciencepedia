Elementary row operations replace rows by linear combinations of the original rows and therefore preserve the row space. Thus, the nonzero rows of a row-echelon form (in particular, the reduced row-echelon form) of $A$ form a basis for the row space.\n\nStart with\n$$\nA=\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -2 & 0 & 3\\\\\n2 & -3 & -1 & 4\\\\\n0 & -1 & 1 & 2\\\\\n3 & -5 & -1 & 7\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nPerform $R_{2}\\leftarrow R_{2}-2R_{1}$ and $R_{4}\\leftarrow R_{4}-3R_{1}$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -2 & 0 & 3\\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & -2\\\\\n0 & -1 & 1 & 2\\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & -2\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nNext, eliminate the third row via $R_{3}\\leftarrow R_{3}+R_{2}$ and the fourth via $R_{4}\\leftarrow R_{4}-R_{2}$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -2 & 0 & 3\\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & -2\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nFinally, use $R_{1}\\leftarrow R_{1}+2R_{2}$ to obtain the reduced row-echelon form:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & -2 & -1\\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & -2\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nTherefore, a basis for the row space is given by the two nonzero rows of the RREF:\n$$\n(1,0,-2,-1),\\quad (0,1,-1,-2),\n$$\nwhich matches option A.

Option A is correct.\n- B: $\\{r_{1},r_{3}\\}$. Since $r_{3}=2r_{1}-r_{2}$, we can recover $r_{2}=2r_{1}-r_{3}$, so $\\operatorname{span}\\{r_{1},r_{3}\\}=\\operatorname{span}\\{r_{1},r_{2}\\}$. They are not multiples of each other, hence independent. Option B is correct.\n- C: $\\{r_{1},r_{4}\\}$ with $r_{4}=r_{1}+r_{2}$. Then $\\operatorname{span}\\{r_{1},r_{4}\\}=\\operatorname{span}\\{r_{1},r_{2}\\}$, and $r_{1},r_{4}$ are independent (if $a r_{1}+b r_{4}=0$, then $(a+b)r_{1}+b r_{2}=0$ forces $b=0$ and $a=0$). Option C is correct.\n- D: $\\{r_{1},r_{2}\\}$ are plainly independent and span the row space. Option D is correct.\n- E: $\\{r_{1},r_{2},r_{4}\\}$ contains three vectors in a $2$-dimensional space, hence is linearly dependent and cannot be a basis. Option E is incorrect.\n- F: $\\{r_{1},(1,1,1,1)\\}$. Check whether $(1,1,1,1)$ lies in the row space by solving $a r_{1}+b r_{2}=(1,1,1,1)$. From the third component, $-b=1$ gives $b=-1$.
