A common method to determine the rank is to transform the matrix into its **row echelon form** using elementary row operations. The rank is then simply the number of non-zero rows in the resulting echelon form matrix. A matrix is in row echelon form if:\n1. All rows consisting entirely of zeros are at the bottom.\n2. The leading non-zero entry (called a pivot) of a non-zero row is to the right of the leading entry of the row above it.\n\nConsider the following $3 \\times 3$ matrix $A$, which contains a variable parameter $z$:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  2  3 \\\\ 2  5  0 \\\\ 1  2  z \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nYour task is to find the specific value of $z$ for which the rank of the matrix $A$ is exactly 2.", "solution": "We apply elementary row operations to $A$:\n$$\nA=\\begin{pmatrix}123\\\\250\\\\12z\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nPerform $R_2\\to R_2-2R_1$ and $R_3\\to R_3-R_1$ to obtain\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n123\\\\\n01-6\\\\\n00z-3\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nIn this row echelon form the pivots are $1$, $1$, and $z-3$.

The matrix $A$ is known to be upper triangular, which means that all entries below the main diagonal are zero.

Exactly one diagonal entry is zero and the other three diagonal entries are nonzero.\n\nFirst, we show that the rank is at least the number of nonzero diagonal entries. Let $S=\\{i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\} : a_{ii} \\neq 0\\}$, so $|S|=3$. For each $i \\in S$, consider the $i$-th row vector $r_{i}$. Because $A$ is upper triangular, in row $i$ all entries in columns $1,\\dots,i-1$ are zero and $a_{ii}\\neq 0$, so the leading (leftmost) nonzero entry of $r_{i}$ is at column $i$. Suppose there is a linear dependence $\\sum_{i \\in S} c_{i} r_{i}=0$. Let $i_{0}$ be the minimal index in $S$ with $c_{i_{0}} \\neq 0$. Looking at column $i_{0}$ of the combination, all rows $r_{j}$ with $ji_{0}$ have zero in column $i_{0}$ (since $A$ is upper triangular), while $r_{i_{0}}$ has $a_{i_{0}i_{0}}\\neq 0$ in that column. Hence the entry in column $i_{0}$ of the sum is $c_{i_{0}} a_{i_{0}i_{0}}=0$, which forces $c_{i_{0}}=0$, a contradiction. Therefore, the rows $\\{r_{i}: i \\in S\\}$ are linearly independent and\n$$\n\\operatorname{rank}(A) \\geq |S| = 3.\n$$\n\nNext, for any triangular matrix, the determinant equals the product of the diagonal entries:\n$$\n\\det(A)=\\prod_{i=1}^{4} a_{ii}.\n$$\nSince exactly one diagonal entry is zero, this product is zero, so $\\det(A)=0$.

This is equal to the maximum number of linearly independent rows (or columns) in the matrix. We can determine the rank of matrix $A$ by analyzing the linear independence of its rows.\n\nFirst, let's write out the matrix $A$ explicitly. The building blocks are:\n$I_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0 \\\\ 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $J_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  1 \\\\ 1  1  1 \\\\ 1  1  1 \\end{pmatrix}$, and $O_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe top-left block is $B = I_3 + J_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  1  1 \\\\ 1  2  1 \\\\ 1  1  2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe top-right and bottom-right blocks are $C = E = J_3$.\nThe bottom-left block is $D = O_3$.\n\nSo, the full $6 \\times 6$ matrix $A$ is:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n2  1  1  1  1  1 \\\\\n1  2  1  1  1  1 \\\\\n1  1  2  1  1  1 \\\\\n0  0  0  1  1  1 \\\\\n0  0  0  1  1  1 \\\\\n0  0  0  1  1  1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nLet the rows of $A$ be $r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5, r_6$. The row space of $A$ is the vector space spanned by these six rows.\n\nWe can see that the last three rows are identical: $r_4 = r_5 = r_6 = (0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1)$. Therefore, the subspace spanned by $\\{r_4, r_5, r_6\\}$ is one-dimensional, with a basis given by the single vector $v = (0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1)$.\n\nNow, let's consider the first three rows:\n$r_1 = (2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)$\n$r_2 = (1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1)$\n$r_3 = (1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1)$\n\nTo determine the dimension of the space spanned by $\\{r_1, r_2, r_3\\}$, we can check for their linear independence. This is equivalent to finding the rank of the $3 \\times 6$ matrix formed by these three rows. The first three components of these rows form the matrix $B = I_3 + J_3$. Let's check if $B$ is invertible by computing its determinant.\n$$\n\\det(B) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2  1  1 \\\\ 1  2  1 \\\\ 1  1  2 \\end{pmatrix} = 2(2 \\cdot 2 - 1 \\cdot 1) - 1(1 \\cdot 2 - 1 \\cdot 1) + 1(1 \\cdot 1 - 2 \\cdot 1)\n$$\n$$\n\\det(B) = 2(3) - 1(1) + 1(-1) = 6 - 1 - 1 = 4\n$$\nSince $\\det(B) \\neq 0$, the matrix $B$ is invertible and has rank 3. This implies that its rows are linearly independent. Since the rows of $B$ are just the first three components of $r_1, r_2, r_3$, the vectors $r_1, r_2, r_3$ must also be linearly independent. (If a linear combination of $r_1, r_2, r_3$ were zero, then the same linear combination of their first three components would be zero, which is only possible for zero coefficients). Thus, the dimension of the space spanned by $\\{r_1, r_2, r_3\\}$ is 3.\n\nThe row space of $A$ is the span of $\\{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5, r_6\\}$, which is the same as the span of the set of four vectors $\\{r_1, r_2, r_3, v\\}$. We have already established that $\\{r_1, r_2, r_3\\}$ is a linearly independent set. To find the dimension of the span of $\\{r_1, r_2, r_3, v\\}$, we need to check if $v$ is a linear combination of $r_1, r_2, r_3$.\n\nSuppose $v = c_1 r_1 + c_2 r_2 + c_3 r_3$ for some scalars $c_1, c_2, c_3$.\nBy looking at the first three components of this vector equation, we have:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = c_1 \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + c_2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + c_3 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  1  1 \\\\ 1  2  1 \\\\ 1  1  2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c_1 \\\\ c_2 \\\\ c_3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis is a homogeneous system of linear equations $B \\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{0}$. Since we found that $\\det(B) = 4 \\neq 0$, the matrix $B$ is invertible, and the only solution to this system is the trivial solution $c_1=c_2=c_3=0$.\nThis would imply $v = 0 \\cdot r_1 + 0 \\cdot r_2 + 0 \\cdot r_3 = \\mathbf{0}$, which contradicts the fact that $v=(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1)$.\nTherefore, $v$ is not in the span of $\\{r_1, r_2, r_3\\}$, meaning $v$ is linearly independent of the first three rows.\n\nThe set of vectors $\\{r_1, r_2, r_3, v\\}$ is linearly independent and spans the row space of $A$. This set contains 4 vectors.\nThus, the dimension of the row space of $A$, which is the rank of $A$, is 4.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "1397997"}]}
