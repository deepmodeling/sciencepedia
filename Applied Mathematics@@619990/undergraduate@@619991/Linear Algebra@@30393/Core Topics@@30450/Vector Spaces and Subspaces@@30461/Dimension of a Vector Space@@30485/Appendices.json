{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding the dimension of a vector space often begins with the intuitive idea of counting degrees of freedom. This exercise invites you to determine the dimension of a space of upper-triangular matrices. By identifying which entries of the matrix can be chosen independently, you are directly counting the number of basis vectors needed to span the space, thus providing a concrete link between the abstract definition of dimension and a tangible counting procedure [@problem_id:1123].", "problem": "Consider the vector space $V$ of all $3 \\times 3$ matrices with real entries. A matrix $A$ in this space is called an upper-triangular matrix if all its entries below the main diagonal are zero. That is, for a matrix $A = [a_{ij}]$, it is upper-triangular if $a_{ij} = 0$ for all $i > j$.\n\nLet $U$ be the set of all $3 \\times 3$ upper-triangular matrices. The set $U$ with the standard operations of matrix addition and scalar multiplication forms a vector subspace of $V$.\n\nYour task is to derive the dimension of the vector space $U$.", "solution": "An upper-triangular matrix $A=[a_{ij}]$ in $U$ satisfies $a_{ij}=0$ for all $i>j$, so the only possibly nonzero entries are those with $1\\le i\\le j\\le3$.
