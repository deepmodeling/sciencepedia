A set with these operations constitutes a vector space over the real numbers if it satisfies a specific list of axioms.\n\nThe set $V$ under these operations is not a vector space because it fails to satisfy all the required axioms.

Closure under addition: Using componentwise addition in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, we have $\\mathbf{u}+\\mathbf{v}=(x_{1}+x_{2},\\,y_{1}+y_{2})$. Since sums of non-negative real numbers are non-negative, $x_{1}+x_{2}\\ge 0$ and $y_{1}+y_{2}\\ge 0$, so $\\mathbf{u}+\\mathbf{v}\\in V$. Thus A is satisfied.\n\nB. Existence of an additive identity: The zero vector in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is $\\mathbf{0}=(0,0)$, and $(0,0)\\in V$ because $0\\ge 0$. By the additive identity property in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, $\\mathbf{u}+\\mathbf{0}=\\mathbf{u}$ for all $\\mathbf{u}\\in V$. Thus B is satisfied.\n\nC. Existence of an additive inverse: The additive inverse in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ of $\\mathbf{u}=(x_{1},y_{1})$ is $-\\mathbf{u}=(-x_{1},-y_{1})$. For $-\\mathbf{u}\\in V$ we require $-x_{1}\\ge 0$ and $-y_{1}\\ge 0$, which is equivalent to $x_{1}\\le 0$ and $y_{1}\\le 0$. Together with $x_{1}\\ge 0$ and $y_{1}\\ge 0$, this forces $x_{1}=0$ and $y_{1}=0$. Hence only $\\mathbf{u}=\\mathbf{0}$ has its additive inverse in $V$, so the axiom fails for general $\\mathbf{u}\\in V$. Thus C is not satisfied.\n\nD. Closure under scalar multiplication: Scalar multiplication in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ gives $c\\mathbf{u}=(c x_{1},\\,c y_{1})$. For $c\\mathbf{u}\\in V$ we need $c x_{1}\\ge 0$ and $c y_{1}\\ge 0$. If $c<0$ and $\\mathbf{u}\\neq \\mathbf{0}$ with any positive component, then at least one of $c x_{1}$ or $c y_{1}$ is negative, so $c\\mathbf{u}\\notin V$. Because the axiom requires closure for all real $c$, it fails. Thus D is not satisfied.\n\nE. Associativity of addition: In $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, addition is associative.

The problem statement explicitly defines the set $S$ to include the zero polynomial. For any polynomial $p(x) \\in S$, we have $p(x) + 0 = p(x)$. Thus, an additive identity exists in $S$. Therefore, statement E is false.\n\nNext, let's check option C: Existence of an additive inverse.\nFor any element $u \\in S$, we need to check if its additive inverse, $-u$, is also in $S$.\nCase 1: $u$ is the zero polynomial, $u(x) = 0$. Its additive inverse is $-u(x) = 0$, which is in $S$.\nCase 2: $u$ is a polynomial of degree exactly 3. Let $u(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$, where $a_3 \\neq 0$. Its additive inverse is $-u(x) = -a_3x^3 - a_2x^2 - a_1x - a_0$. The leading coefficient of $-u(x)$ is $-a_3$. Since $a_3 \\neq 0$, it follows that $-a_3 \\neq 0$. This means $-u(x)$ is also a polynomial of degree exactly 3. Thus, $-u(x) \\in S$.\nSince every element in $S$ has an additive inverse in $S$, the axiom for the existence of an additive inverse is satisfied. Therefore, statement C is false.\n\nNow, let's check option D: Closure under scalar multiplication.\nFor any scalar $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and any element $u \\in S$, we need to check if $c \\cdot u$ is in $S$.\nCase 1: $u$ is the zero polynomial, $u(x) = 0$. Then for any scalar $c$, $c \\cdot u(x) = c \\cdot 0 = 0$, which is in $S$.\nCase 2: $u$ is a polynomial of degree exactly 3. Let $u(x) = a_3x^3 + \\dots$, where $a_3 \\neq 0$.\nIf $c \\neq 0$, then $c \\cdot u(x) = (ca_3)x^3 + \\dots$. The leading coefficient $ca_3$ is non-zero, so $c \\cdot u(x)$ is a polynomial of degree exactly 3 and is in $S$.\nIf $c = 0$, then $c \\cdot u(x) = 0 \\cdot u(x) = 0$, which is in $S$ by definition.\nIn all possible cases, the result of scalar multiplication is an element of $S$. Thus, the axiom of closure under scalar multiplication is satisfied. Therefore, statement D is false.\n\nFinally, let's check option B: Closure under addition.\nFor any two elements $u, v \\in S$, we need to check if their sum $u+v$ is also in $S$. Let's test this with a counterexample.\nLet $u(x) = 2x^3 - x^2 + 5$. Since the degree of $u(x)$ is 3, $u(x) \\in S$.\nLet $v(x) = -2x^3 + 4x^2 + x$. Since the degree of $v(x)$ is 3, $v(x) \\in S$.\nNow, let's compute their sum:\n$u(x) + v(x) = (2x^3 - x^2 + 5) + (-2x^3 + 4x^2 + x)$\n$u(x) + v(x) = (2 - 2)x^3 + (-1 + 4)x^2 + x + 5$\n$u(x) + v(x) = 0x^3 + 3x^2 + x + 5 = 3x^2 + x + 5$.\nThe resulting polynomial, $3x^2 + x + 5$, has a degree of 2. It is not the zero polynomial and it is not a polynomial of degree exactly 3. Therefore, the sum $u(x) + v(x)$ is not an element of $S$.\nSince we found a pair of elements in $S$ whose sum is not in $S$, the set is not closed under addition. The axiom of closure under addition fails.\n\nBecause at least one axiom is not satisfied, $S$ is not a vector space. The specific axiom that fails is closure under addition.
