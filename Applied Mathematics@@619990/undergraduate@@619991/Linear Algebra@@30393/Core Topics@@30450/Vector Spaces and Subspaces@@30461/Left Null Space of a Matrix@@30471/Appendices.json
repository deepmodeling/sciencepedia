An alternative and effective method is to perform Gaussian elimination on the augmented matrix $[A | I]$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. The row operations that transform $A$ into its row echelon form $U$ are represented by a matrix $E$, such that $EA = U$. Applying the same operations to $I$ yields $E$ itself. Therefore, row-reducing $[A|I]$ gives $[U|E]$.\n\nThe rows of $E$ that correspond to the zero rows in $U$ form a basis for the left null space of $A$.
