This first practice invites you to use two of the most basic ones—linearity and invariance under transposition—to prove an important result. By working through this problem [@problem_id:1400123], you will discover a universal characteristic of skew-symmetric matrices, which are defined as matrices $S$ where $S^T = -S$, demonstrating how these simple rules lead to powerful general conclusions.", "problem": "Let $M$ be an arbitrary $n \\times n$ matrix with real-valued entries.
