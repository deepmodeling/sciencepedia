The inverse of $K$, which is the compliance matrix $C = K^{-1}$, is symmetric.\n2. The trace of $K$ is 20.\n\nLet's first analyze the condition that $K^{-1}$ is symmetric. A fundamental property of invertible matrices states that a matrix $A$ is symmetric if and only if its inverse $A^{-1}$ is symmetric. We can prove the part relevant to our problem: if $A^{-1}$ is symmetric, then $A$ must be symmetric.\n\nLet $B = A^{-1}$. We are given that $B$ is symmetric, which means $B^T = B$. Our goal is to show that $A$ is symmetric, i.e., $A^T = A$.\nWe know that $A = (A^{-1})^{-1} = B^{-1}$.\nTaking the transpose of $A$, we get $A^T = (B^{-1})^T$.\nUsing the property that the transpose of an inverse is the inverse of the transpose, we have $(B^{-1})^T = (B^T)^{-1}$.\nSo, $A^T = (B^T)^{-1}$.\nSince we are given that $B$ is symmetric ($B^T = B$), we can substitute $B$ for $B^T$:\n$A^T = B^{-1}$.\nBy definition, $A = B^{-1}$.\nTherefore, we have shown that $A^T = A$, which means that $A$ is a symmetric matrix.\n\nApplying this principle to our problem, since the compliance matrix $C = K^{-1}$ is symmetric, the stiffness matrix $K$ must also be symmetric.\nA matrix is symmetric if it is equal to its transpose, i.e., $K = K^T$.\nThe matrix $K$ is given as:\n$$\nK = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\alpha & 12 & z \\\\\nx & 9 & -5 \\\\\n-4 & y & 7\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nIts transpose, $K^T$, is obtained by interchanging the rows and columns:\n$$\nK^T = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\alpha & x & -4 \\\\\n12 & 9 & y \\\\\nz & -5 & 7\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor $K$ to be symmetric, we must have $K = K^T$.
