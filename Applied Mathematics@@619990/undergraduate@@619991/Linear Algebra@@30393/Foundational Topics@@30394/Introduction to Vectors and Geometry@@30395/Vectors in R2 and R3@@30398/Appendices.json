The rover starts at the origin, represented by the vector $\\vec{o} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Its movement is controlled by executing two pre-programmed vector displacements:\n- Move A, represented by the vector $\\vec{m}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- Move B, represented by the vector $\\vec{m}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe rover can perform any of these moves any number of times. It can also perform fractions of a move (e.g., $0.5$ times Move A) or moves in the reverse direction (e.g., $-2$ times Move B). A task requires the rover to travel from its starting point to a target destination located at the point corresponding to the vector $\\vec{p} = \\begin{pmatrix} 13 \\\\ 13 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nTo reach this destination, the rover's total displacement must be a direct combination of its allowed moves, such that the target vector $\\vec{p}$ is formed by a sum of scaled movement vectors: $\\vec{p} = c_1 \\vec{m}_1 + c_2 \\vec{m}_2$. Here, $c_1$ and $c_2$ are the dimensionless scaling factors indicating how many times Move A and Move B are executed, respectively.\n\nDetermine the unique pair of scaling factors $(c_1, c_2)$ required for the rover to reach its target destination.", "solution": "The problem asks for the scaling factors $c_1$ and $c_2$ that satisfy the vector equation $\\vec{p} = c_1 \\vec{m}_1 + c_2 \\vec{m}_2$.\n\nWe are given the following vectors:\nTarget vector: $\\vec{p} = \\begin{pmatrix} 13 \\\\ 13 \\end{pmatrix}$\nMovement vector 1: $\\vec{m}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$\nMovement vector 2: $\\vec{m}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe substitute these vectors into the given equation:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 13 \\\\ 13 \\end{pmatrix} = c_1 \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + c_2 \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nNext, we perform scalar multiplication on the right side of the equation:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 13 \\\\ 13 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2c_1 \\\\ 5c_1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} -3c_2 \\\\ c_2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThen, we add the vectors on the right side:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 13 \\\\ 13 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2c_1 - 3c_2 \\\\ 5c_1 + c_2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nFor the two vectors to be equal, their corresponding components must be equal.

It is convenient to use the substitution method. From Equation 2, we can isolate $c_2$:\n$$\nc_2 = 13 - 5c_1\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $c_2$ into Equation 1:\n$$\n2c_1 - 3(13 - 5c_1) = 13\n$$\n\nDistribute the $-3$ into the parentheses:\n$$\n2c_1 - 39 + 15c_1 = 13\n$$\n\nCombine the terms with $c_1$ and move the constant term to the right side:\n$$\n17c_1 = 13 + 39\n$$\n$$\n17c_1 = 52\n$$\n\nSolve for $c_1$:\n$$\nc_1 = \\frac{52}{17}\n$$\n\nNow that we have the value for $c_1$, we can substitute it back into the expression we found for $c_2$:\n$$\nc_2 = 13 - 5c_1 = 13 - 5\\left(\\frac{52}{17}\\right)\n$$\n\nTo combine these terms, we find a common denominator:\n$$\nc_2 = \\frac{13 \\times 17}{17} - \\frac{5 \\times 52}{17}\n$$\n$$\nc_2 = \\frac{221}{17} - \\frac{260}{17}\n$$\n$$\nc_2 = \\frac{221 - 260}{17} = -\\frac{39}{17}\n$$\n\nSo, the unique pair of scaling factors is $(c_1, c_2) = \\left(\\frac{52}{17}, -\\frac{39}{17}\\right)$.
