The affine constraint: $\\alpha + \\beta = 1$\n\nFirst, let's write out the vector equation from the linear combination condition:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\alpha \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} + \\beta \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis vector equation can be expanded into a system of three linear equations, one for each component:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n1\\alpha + 4\\beta = -2 & (1) \\\\\n2\\alpha + 5\\beta = -1 & (2) \\\\\n3\\alpha + 6\\beta = 0 & (3)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nWe also have the fourth equation from the affine constraint:\n$$\n\\alpha + \\beta = 1 \\quad (4)\n$$\nWe need to find a pair $(\\alpha, \\beta)$ that satisfies all four equations.
