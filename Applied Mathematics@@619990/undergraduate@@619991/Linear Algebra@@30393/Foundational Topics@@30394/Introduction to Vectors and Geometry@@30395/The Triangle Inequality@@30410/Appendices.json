The vector sum is $u+v = (u_1+v_1, u_2+v_2, \\dots, u_n+v_n)$.\n\nBy the definition of the $L_1$-norm, the equality condition is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |u_i + v_i| = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |u_i| + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |v_i| $$\nWe can combine the sums on the right-hand side:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |u_i + v_i| = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (|u_i| + |v_i|) $$\nThis equation can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( (|u_i| + |v_i|) - |u_i + v_i| \\right) = 0 $$\nFor any pair of real numbers $a$ and $b$, the standard triangle inequality for absolute values states that $|a+b| \\le |a|+|b|$. This implies that each term in the summation, $(|u_i| + |v_i|) - |u_i + v_i|$, is greater than or equal to zero.\n\nFor a sum of non-negative terms to be equal to zero, each individual term must be zero. Therefore, the equality holds if and only if for every index $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$:\n$$ |u_i| + |v_i| - |u_i + v_i| = 0 $$\n$$ |u_i + v_i| = |u_i| + |v_i| $$\nThis is the condition for equality in the triangle inequality for real numbers. For real numbers $a$ and $b$, the equality $|a+b| = |a|+|b|$ holds if and only if $a$ and $b$ have the same sign, or at least one of them is zero. This condition can be expressed succinctly as $ab \\ge 0$.\n\nApplying this to our vector components, the condition $|u_i + v_i| = |u_i| + |v_i|$ is equivalent to the condition that $u_i$ and $v_i$ have the same sign or one/both are zero. This is precisely the condition $u_i v_i \\ge 0$.\n\nThus, the necessary and sufficient condition for $\\|u+v\\|_1 = \\|u\\|_1 + \\|v\\|_1$ is that for every component $i$ from $1$ to $n$, we must have $u_i v_i \\ge 0$.\n\nNow let's analyze the given options:\nA. The vectors $u$ and $v$ must be linearly dependent. This is not necessary. Consider $u=(1,1)$ and $v=(2,3)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. These vectors are linearly independent. For $i=1$, $u_1v_1 = 1 \\cdot 2 = 2 \\ge 0$. For $i=2$, $u_2v_2 = 1 \\cdot 3 = 3 \\ge 0$. The condition $u_iv_i \\ge 0$ is met for all $i$. Let's check the norm equality: $\\|u\\|_1 = |1|+|1|=2$, $\\|v\\|_1 = |2|+|3|=5$. $\\|u+v\\|_1 = \\|(3,4)\\|_1 = |3|+|4|=7$. We see that $\\|u+v\\|_1 = 7 = 2+5 = \\|u\\|_1+\\|v\\|_1$. So, equality can hold for linearly independent vectors.\n\nB. There must exist a non-negative scalar $c \\ge 0$ such that $u = cv$. This is a sufficient condition because if $u = cv$ with $c \\ge 0$, then for each $i$, $u_i = c v_i$. This implies $u_i v_i = c v_i^2 \\ge 0$, which is the correct condition. However, it is not a necessary condition. The counterexample from A with $u=(1,1)$ and $v=(2,3)$ shows that the equality can hold even when $u$ is not a scalar multiple of $v$.\n\nC. For every index $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, the product of the corresponding components must be non-negative, i.e., $u_i v_i \\ge 0$. As derived above, this is the correct necessary and sufficient condition.\n\nD. The dot product of the two vectors must be non-negative, i.e., $\\sum_{i=1}^n u_i v_i \\ge 0$. This is not sufficient. Consider $u=(2,-1)$ and $v=(3,1)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The dot product is $u \\cdot v = 2 \\cdot 3 + (-1) \\cdot 1 = 6-1=5 \\ge 0$. However, for the second component ($i=2$), $u_2v_2 = (-1)(1) = -1  0$. The condition from C is violated. Let's check the norm equality: $\\|u\\|_1 = |2|+|-1|=3$, $\\|v\\|_1 = |3|+|1|=4$. $\\|u+v\\|_1 = \\|(5,0)\\|_1 = 5$. Since $5 \\ne 3+4=7$, the equality does not hold.\n\nE. For every index $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, the product of the corresponding components must be strictly positive, i.e., $u_i v_i  0$. This is not necessary. It incorrectly excludes cases where some components can be zero. Consider $u=(1,0)$ and $v=(2,0)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. These are non-zero vectors. The condition $u_iv_i\\ge 0$ is met: $u_1v_1 = 2 \\ge 0$ and $u_2v_2=0 \\ge 0$. The norm equality holds: $\\|u\\|_1=1$, $\\|v\\|_1=2$, $\\|u+v\\|_1=\\|(3,0)\\|_1=3$. So $3=1+2$. However, the condition $u_i v_i  0$ is not met for $i=2$. Therefore, this condition is too strict and not necessary.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only correct necessary and sufficient condition is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1399565"}]}
