In a two-dimensional plane like $\\mathbb{R}^2$, two vectors can typically \"span\" the entire plane, meaning any point can be reached through their linear combination.

By investigating this scenario, you'll build a solid intuition for linear dependence and how it geometrically confines the span of a set of vectors to a smaller dimension, like a line within a plane.", "problem": "A simple robotic rover operates on a large, flat plane, which can be modeled as the two-dimensional real coordinate space, $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The rover's movement is controlled by executing two fundamental displacement commands, which correspond to the vectors $\\mathbf{u} = (1, 2)$ and $\\mathbf{v} = (-2, h)$, where $h$ is a configurable real-valued parameter. Any final displacement of the rover from its starting point is achieved by a linear combination of these two vectors; that is, any reachable point can be represented as $c_1\\mathbf{u} + c_2\\mathbf{v}$ for some real scalars $c_1$ and $c_2$.\n\nThere exists a specific value of the parameter $h$ for which the set of all reachable points for the rover is dramatically limited, confining it to a single line through the origin instead of allowing it to access the entire plane. Determine this specific value of $h$.", "solution": "The set of all reachable displacements is the span of $\\mathbf{u}=(1,2)$ and $\\mathbf{v}=(-2,h)$.
