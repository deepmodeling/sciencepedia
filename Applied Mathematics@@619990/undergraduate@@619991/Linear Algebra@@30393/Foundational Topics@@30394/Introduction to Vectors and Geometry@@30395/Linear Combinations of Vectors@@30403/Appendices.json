We are looking for scalar coefficients $k_1, k_2, k_3$ such that for any choice of $a, b, c$:\n$$k_1 p_1(x) + k_2 p_2(x) + k_3 p_3(x) = q(x)$$\n\nSubstitute the given polynomials into the equation:\n$$k_1 (x^2 + 1) + k_2 (x - 2) + k_3 (x^2 + x) = ax^2 + bx + c$$\n\nNext, we expand the left side and group the terms by powers of $x$:\n$$(k_1 x^2 + k_1) + (k_2 x - 2k_2) + (k_3 x^2 + k_3 x) = ax^2 + bx + c$$\n$$(k_1 + k_3)x^2 + (k_2 + k_3)x + (k_1 - 2k_2) = ax^2 + bx + c$$\n\nFor two polynomials to be equal, the coefficients of corresponding powers of $x$ must be equal.

A square matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is non-zero. Let's calculate the determinant of $A$ using cofactor expansion along the first row:\n$$ \\det(A) = 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ -2 & 0 \\end{vmatrix} - 0 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{vmatrix} + 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -2 \\end{vmatrix} $$\n$$ \\det(A) = 1 \\cdot ((1)(0) - (1)(-2)) - 0 + 1 \\cdot ((0)(-2) - (1)(1)) $$\n$$ \\det(A) = 1 \\cdot (0 + 2) + 1 \\cdot (0 - 1) $$\n$$ \\det(A) = 2 - 1 = 1 $$\n\nSince the determinant of the coefficient matrix $A$ is $1$, which is non-zero, the matrix $A$ is invertible. This has two important consequences:\n1. For any vector $\\mathbf{v} = (a, b, c)^T$, there exists a solution for $\\mathbf{k}$, given by $\\mathbf{k} = A^{-1}\\mathbf{v}$. This means any polynomial $q(x)$ in $P_2$ can be formed by a linear combination of $p_1, p_2, p_3$.\n2.

A non-zero determinant implies the column vectors (and thus the corresponding polynomials) are linearly independent.\nC) No, a linear combination is only possible if the coefficients of the target polynomial satisfy the relation $a+b-c=0$. - This would be true if the determinant were zero, implying a condition on $a, b, c$ for a solution to exist. Since the determinant is non-zero, no such constraint exists.\nD) No, because none of the given polynomials have a degree of exactly zero, making it impossible to form an arbitrary constant term $c$. - This is false. The constant term of the linear combination is $k_1 - 2k_2$, which can be set to any real value $c$ by choosing appropriate $k_1$ and $k_2$.\nE) A linear combination is possible for any target polynomial, but it is not unique. - This is false.
