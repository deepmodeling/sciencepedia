These are typically the smallest integers having the same ratio as the components of the vector. Imagine a researcher is investigating a novel material whose properties are anisotropic. An important axis of this anisotropy is aligned with the crystallographic direction given by the indices $[1, -2, 4]$.\n\nFor a computer simulation of wave propagation along this axis, the direction must be represented by a unit vector $\\mathbf{u}$.
