These rates are unknown constants. An engineer takes three independent measurements of the differences in production rates between the stages. The measurements are:\n1. The difference between the rate of the first stage and the second stage is $a$.\n2. The difference between the rate of the second stage and the third stage is $b$.\n3. The difference between the rate of the first stage and the third stage is $c$.\n\nThe values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ are externally controlled parameters. For a given set of parameters $(a, b, c)$, a physically possible scenario corresponds to a set of non-negative production rates $(p_1, p_2, p_3)$ that satisfy the measurement conditions. However, not all choices of $a$, $b$, and $c$ will allow for a set of underlying production rates to exist. For the system of measurements to be self-consistent (i.e., for at least one solution for the production rates to exist), the parameter $c$ must be a specific function of $a$ and $b$. That is, the measurements are self-consistent if and only if $c = f(a, b)$ for some function $f$.\n\nFind the expression for $f(a, b)$.", "solution": "Let the production rates be real numbers $p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}$, constrained by the measured signed differences:\n$$\np_{1} - p_{2} = a, \\quad p_{2} - p_{3} = b, \\quad p_{1} - p_{3} = c.\n$$\nNecessity: From the first two equations,\n$$\np_{1} - p_{3} = (p_{1} - p_{2}) + (p_{2} - p_{3}) = a + b.\n$$\nComparing with the third measurement $p_{1} - p_{3} = c$ gives the necessary condition\n$$\nc = a + b.\n$$\n\nSufficiency (including non-negativity feasibility): Assume $c = a + b$.
