We will test the row equivalence of each option and check if it satisfies the stated definitions.\n\nAn elementary row operation can be one of three types:\n1. Swapping two rows ($R_i \\leftrightarrow R_j$).\n2. Multiplying a row by a non-zero scalar ($R_i \\leftarrow c R_i, c \\neq 0$).\n3.

A different sequence of operations may lead to a different REF.\nLet's\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 2: $R_1 \\leftrightarrow R_2$.\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 5 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\xrightarrow{R_1 \\leftrightarrow R_2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 5 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n2.

We perform the operation $R_2 \\leftarrow R_2 - 3R_1$.\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\xrightarrow{R_2 \\leftarrow R_2 - 3R_1} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3-3(1) & 5-3(2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n3. The pivot in the second row must be 1. We perform the operation $R_2 \\leftarrow -1 \\cdot R_2$.\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\xrightarrow{R_2 \\leftarrow -R_2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis resulting matrix is Option A. Let's check if it is an REF.\n1. No all-zero rows. (Satisfied)\n2. Pivots in each row are 1. (Satisfied)\n3. The pivot in row 2 (column 2) is to the right of the pivot in row 1 (column 1). (Satisfied)\n4. The entry below the pivot in column 1 is 0. (Satisfied)\nSo, Option A is a valid REF of $A$. Is it the RREF? For it to be the RREF, the pivot in column 2 must be the only non-zero entry in that column. However, the entry in row 1, column 2 is 2, not 0. Therefore, Option A is an REF but not the RREF. Thus, **A is a correct choice**.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:** $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\frac{5}{3} \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nLet's try a different sequence of operations on $A$.\n1. Start with $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 5 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Instead of swapping, let's make the first pivot 1 by scaling the first row: $R_1 \\leftarrow \\frac{1}{3}R_1$.\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 5 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\xrightarrow{R_1 \\leftarrow \\frac{1}{3}R_1} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\frac{5}{3} \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n2. Create a zero below the first pivot: $R_2 \\leftarrow R_2 - R_1$.\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\frac{5}{3} \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\xrightarrow{R_2 \\leftarrow R_2 - R_1} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\frac{5}{3} \\\\ 1-1 & 2-\\frac{5}{3} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\frac{5}{3} \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{3} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n3. Make the pivot in the second row 1: $R_2 \\leftarrow 3R_2$.\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\frac{5}{3} \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{3} \\end{pmatrix} \\xrightarrow{R_2 \\leftarrow 3R_2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\frac{5}{3} \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis resulting matrix is Option B. Let's check if it is an REF.\n1-4. It satisfies all conditions for an REF for the same reasons as Option A.\nIs it the RREF? The entry in row 1, column 2 is $\\frac{5}{3}$, not 0. So it is not the RREF.\nSince Options A and B are different, this demonstrates that the REF is not unique. Since Option B is an REF but not the RREF, **B is a correct choice**.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:** $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can obtain this matrix by continuing from either Option A or B. Let's start from A: $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. To make the pivot in column 2 the only non-zero entry, we perform $R_1 \\leftarrow R_1 - 2R_2$.\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\xrightarrow{R_1 \\leftarrow R_1 - 2R_2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1-2(0) & 2-2(1) \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis is Option C. It is in REF, and it also satisfies the additional condition for RREF (all pivots are the only non-zero entries in their columns). Therefore, Option C is the RREF of $A$. The question asks for matrices that are REFs but *not* the RREF. Thus, C is not a correct choice.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:** $\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 5 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{3} \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix is row-equivalent to A (it is an intermediate step in the derivation of Option B). Let's check if it is an REF.\nCondition 2 for REF states that the first non-zero entry (pivot) in each non-zero row must be 1. The pivot of the first row is 3. Since $3 \\neq 1$, this matrix is not in REF according to the problem's definition. Thus, D is not a correct choice.\n\n**Analysis of Option E:** $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix is row-equivalent to A (it is an intermediate step in the derivation of Option A). Let's check if it is an REF.\nCondition 2 requires the pivot of each non-zero row to be 1. The pivot of the second row is -1. Since $-1 \\neq 1$, this matrix is not in REF. Thus, E is not a correct choice.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe matrices that are valid Row Echelon Forms of A but not the Reduced Row Echelon Form are A and B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\text{A, B}}$$", "id": "2168399"}]}
