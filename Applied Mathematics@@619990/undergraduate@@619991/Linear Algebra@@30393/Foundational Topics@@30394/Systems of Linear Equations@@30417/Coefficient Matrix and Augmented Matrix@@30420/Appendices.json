The state of the system at equilibrium is described by the quantities of these components, denoted by the variables $x_1, x_2,$ and $x_3$, respectively. Based on established physical laws and experimental observations, the relationships between these quantities are governed by a system of three linear equations.\n\nThe relationships are as follows:\n1. A total inventory count reveals that the sum of twice the quantity of Type 1, five times the quantity of Type 2, and three times the quantity of Type 3 is constant.\n2. An internal process constraint, which does not involve Type 1 components, dictates that twice the quantity of Type 3 components minus four times the quantity of Type 2 components results in a constant value.\n3. The quantity of Type 3 components is controlled by an external calibration parameter $\\lambda$, which is known to be a positive real number. This relationship is succinctly described by the equation $\\lambda x_3 = K$, where $K$ is a fixed, non-zero constant for the experiment.\n\nThese three statements define a system of linear equations for the variables $x_1, x_2,$ and $x_3$.

This gives $2x_3 - 4x_2 = C_2$. Writing this in standard order gives $-4x_{2}+2x_{3}=C_{2}$, where $C_{2}$ is a constant.\n3) The calibration condition is $\\lambda x_{3}=K$, with $K\\neq 0$ and $\\lambda>0$.\n\nThus the coefficient matrix $A$ corresponding to these equations (in the order $(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})$) is\n$$\nA=\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 5 & 3\\\\\n0 & -4 & 2\\\\\n0 & 0 & \\lambda\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nMatrix $A$ is upper triangular, so the determinant equals the product of its diagonal entries:\n$$\n\\det(A)=2\\cdot(-4)\\cdot\\lambda=-8\\lambda.\n$$\nGiven $\\det(A)=-72$, we solve\n$$\n-8\\lambda=-72 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\lambda=\\frac{-72}{-8}=9.\n$$\nThis satisfies the requirement that $\\lambda$ be a positive real number.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9}$$", "id": "1353735"}, {"introduction": "Not all systems of equations have a solution.
