Let $x_1, x_2,$ and $x_3$ represent the weekly budget allocations (in thousands of dollars) for online ads, social media campaigns, and print media, respectively. The effectiveness and resource constraints of these strategies are captured by the following system of linear equations:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ncx_1 + x_2 + x_3 &= 1 \\\\\nx_1 + cx_2 + x_3 &= 2 \\\\\nx_1 + x_2 + cx_3 &= -3\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nThe parameter $c$ is a 'synergy factor' that depends on market conditions. The system can have a unique budget allocation, no possible allocation (an inconsistent model), or an infinite number of possible allocations (an under-specified model).\n\nLet $c_{inf}$ be the value of the synergy factor $c$ for which the system has infinitely many solutions, and let $c_{no}$ be the value of $c$ for which the system has no solution.

Specifically, if the determinant of $A$ is non-zero, the system has a unique solution. If the determinant of $A$ is zero, the system has either no solution or infinitely many solutions. Let's compute the determinant of $A$.\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\det(A) &= c \\begin{vmatrix} c & 1 \\\\ 1 & c \\end{vmatrix} - 1 \\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & c \\end{vmatrix} + 1 \\begin{vmatrix} 1 & c \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{vmatrix} \\\\\n&= c(c^2 - 1) - 1(c - 1) + 1(1 - c) \\\\\n&= c(c-1)(c+1) - (c-1) - (c-1) \\\\\n&= (c-1)[c(c+1) - 1 - 1] \\\\\n&= (c-1)(c^2 + c - 2) \\\\\n&= (c-1)(c+2)(c-1) \\\\\n&= (c-1)^2(c+2)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nThe determinant is zero when $(c-1)^2(c+2) = 0$, which gives the critical values $c=1$ and $c=-2$.

We must now investigate these two cases to determine which corresponds to no solution ($c_{no}$) and which to infinitely many solutions ($c_{inf}$).\n\nCase 1: $c=1$\nWe form the augmented matrix $[A|\\mathbf{b}]$ and perform Gaussian elimination.\nFor $c=1$, the augmented matrix is:\n$$\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & -3\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n$$\nWe perform the following row operations: $R_2 \\to R_2 - R_1$ and $R_3 \\to R_3 - R_1$.\n$$\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & -4\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n$$\nThe second row represents the equation $0x_1 + 0x_2 + 0x_3 = 1$, which simplifies to $0 = 1$. This is a contradiction, which means the system is inconsistent. Therefore, for $c=1$, there is no solution.

The system is consistent. The rank of the coefficient matrix (and the augmented matrix) is 2, which is less than the number of variables (3). This means there is one free variable, and thus the system has infinitely many solutions. Therefore, for $c=-2$, there are infinitely many solutions. This gives us $c_{inf} = -2$.\n\nWe have found $c_{inf} = -2$ and $c_{no} = 1$.
