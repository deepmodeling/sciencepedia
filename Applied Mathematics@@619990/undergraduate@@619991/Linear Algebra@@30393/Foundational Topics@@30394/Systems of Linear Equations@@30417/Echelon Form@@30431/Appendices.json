This process is fundamental for solving systems of linear equations, finding matrix inverses, and determining key properties of a matrix, such as its rank.\n\nThe three elementary row operations are:\n1.  Swapping two rows.\n2.  Multiplying a row by a non-zero scalar.\n3.  Adding a multiple of one row to another row.\n\nA matrix is in **reduced row echelon form** if it satisfies the following conditions:\n1.  All rows consisting entirely of zeros are at the bottom of the matrix.\n2.  The first non-zero number from the left in any non-zero row is a 1. This entry is called a **leading 1** or a **pivot**.\n3.  Each leading 1 is in a column to the right of the leading 1s in the rows above it.\n4.  Each column that contains a leading 1 has zeros in every other entry.\n\nThe **rank** of a matrix is defined as the number of leading 1s (or pivots) in its reduced row echelon form. This is equivalent to the number of non-zero rows in the RREF.\n\nConsider the following $3 \\times 4$ matrix $A$:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -2 & 0 & 3 \\\\\n2 & -3 & -1 & 4 \\\\\n1 & -3 & 1 & 5\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nYour task is to transform this matrix into its reduced row echelon form and then determine its rank.

This question does not require extensive row reduction but is a thought experiment that tests your grasp of what it means for a matrix's RREF to be the identity matrix, $I_n$. By considering a matrix $M$ where $M^2 = \\mathbf{0}$, this problem [@problem_id:1359905] challenges you to connect the algebraic properties of a matrix to the geometric and structural implications of its RREF, reinforcing a key principle in linear algebra.", "problem": "Let $M$ be a non-zero square matrix of size $n \\times n$ with real entries.

We analyze the implications and the student's claim about the reduced row echelon form (RREF) of $M$.\n\nFirst, $M^2 = \\mathbf{0}$ implies that $M$ is nilpotent of index at most $2$.

More concretely, if $\\operatorname{rref}(M) = I_n$, then there exists a finite product of elementary matrices $E$ such that\n$$\nEM=I_n,\n$$\nwhich implies\n$$\nM=E^{-1},\n$$\nso $M$ is invertible.\n\nCombining the two facts yields a contradiction: from $M^2=\\mathbf{0}$ we deduced $\\det(M)=0$, so $M$ is not invertible; but if $\\operatorname{rref}(M)=I_n$ then $M$ would be invertible. Therefore, the student's claim that the RREF of such an $M$ is $I_n$ is incorrect.\n\nTo rule out option C, note that $M^2=\\mathbf{0}$ does not force $M=\\mathbf{0}$.

Option E is false because the conclusion does not depend on the specific entries, only on the equation $M^2=\\mathbf{0}$.\n\nThus, the correct statement is that the claim is incorrect because a matrix whose RREF is the identity must be invertible, which contradicts $M^2=\\mathbf{0}$ for a non-zero matrix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1359905"}]}
