This process is fundamental for solving systems of linear equations, finding matrix inverses, and determining key properties of a matrix, such as its rank.\n\nThe three elementary row operations are:\n1.  Swapping two rows.\n2.  Multiplying a row by a non-zero scalar.\n3.  Adding a multiple of one row to another row.\n\nA matrix is in **reduced row echelon form** if it satisfies the following conditions:\n1.  All rows consisting entirely of zeros are at the bottom of the matrix.\n2.  The first non-zero number from the left in any non-zero row is a 1. This entry is called a **leading 1** or a **pivot**.\n3.  Each leading 1 is in a column to the right of the leading 1s in the rows above it.\n4.  Each column that contains a leading 1 has zeros in every other entry.\n\nThe **rank** of a matrix is defined as the number of leading 1s (or pivots) in its reduced row echelon form. This is equivalent to the number of non-zero rows in the RREF.\n\nConsider the following $3 \\times 4$ matrix $A$:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1  -2  0  3 \\\\\n2  -3  -1  4 \\\\\n1  -3  1  5\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nYour task is to transform this matrix into its reduced row echelon form and then determine its rank.

This problem connects the abstract concept of linear dependence to a concrete calculation involving a matrix with an unknown parameter.

We can determine the value of $k$ that causes this by performing row reduction on matrix $A$.\n\nFirst, let's construct the matrix $A$:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  2  3 \\\\ 2  3  4 \\\\ 3  4  k \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow, we perform Gaussian elimination to transform $A$ into a row echelon form.\nOur goal is to create zeros below the first pivot in the first column.

In the row echelon form, the first two rows have pivots (at positions (1,1) and (2,2)). The third pivot would be at position (3,3). A third pivot exists only if the entry at this position, which is $k-5$, is non-zero.\n\nIf this entry is zero, the third row becomes a zero row, and the rank of the matrix is 2, which is less than 3.
