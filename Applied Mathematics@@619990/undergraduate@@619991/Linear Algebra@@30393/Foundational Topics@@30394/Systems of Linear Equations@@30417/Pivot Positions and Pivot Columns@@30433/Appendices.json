Such a matrix is invertible, so all three columns are pivot columns. This fails Property P.\n\nB. $B$ has first column $c_1 = (0,0,0)^T$, which cannot be a pivot column.

To see $c_3 \\notin \\operatorname{span}\\{c_1\\}$, suppose $c_3 = t c_1$; then $(1,1,0)^T = t(1,2,3)^T$ gives $t=1$ from the first component, which forces the second component to be $2$, not $1$, a contradiction.
