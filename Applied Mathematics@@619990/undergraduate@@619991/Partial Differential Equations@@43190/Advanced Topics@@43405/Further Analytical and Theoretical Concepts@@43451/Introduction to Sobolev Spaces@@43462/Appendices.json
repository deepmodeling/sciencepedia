Yes, $f(x)$ is in $H^1_{loc}(\\mathbb{R})$ because it is a bounded and periodic function, which ensures both the function and its derivative are sufficiently well-behaved on any compact subset of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nB. Yes, $f(x)$ is in $H^1_{loc}(\\mathbb{R})$ because its classical derivative is $f'(x) = 1$ for all non-integer $x$, and the constant function $g(x)=1$ is an element of $L^2_{loc}(\\mathbb{R})$.\n\nC. No, $f(x)$ is not in $H^1_{loc}(\\mathbb{R})$ because a function in $H^1$ on any given interval must be equal almost everywhere to a continuous function, but the sawtooth wave's inherent jump discontinuities make this impossible for any interval containing an integer.\n\nD. No, $f(x)$ is not in $H^1_{loc}(\\mathbb{R})$ because the function $f(x)$ is not in $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$, as the integral of $|f(x)|^2$ over the entire real line diverges.", "solution": "To determine if the function $f(x) = x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor - \\frac{1}{2}$ is in the local Sobolev space $H^1_{loc}(\\mathbb{R})$, we must check if its restriction to any bounded open interval $I \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ belongs to the Sobolev space $H^1(I)$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the function $f(x)$.\nFor $x \\in [k, k+1)$ where $k$ is an integer, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor = k$, so $f(x) = x - k - \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe function is piecewise linear with a slope of 1. Let's examine its behavior at an integer, for example at $x=1$.\nThe limit from the left is $\\lim_{x \\to 1^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 1^-} (x - 0 - \\frac{1}{2}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe value at $x=1$ is $f(1) = 1 - \\lfloor 1 \\rfloor - \\frac{1}{2} = 1 - 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\nSince $\\lim_{x \\to 1^-} f(x) \\neq f(1)$, the function has a jump discontinuity at $x=1$. By its periodic nature, $f(x)$ has a jump discontinuity at every integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nAccording to the definition of $H^1_{loc}(\\mathbb{R})$, $f$ must belong to $H^1(I)$ for *every* bounded open interval $I \\subset \\mathbb{R}$. Let's choose an interval that contains one of the discontinuities, for example, $I = (0, 2)$.\n\nFor a function $u$ to be in $H^1(I)$, two conditions must be met:\n1.  $u \\in L^2(I)$.\n2.  Its weak derivative $u'$ exists and $u' \\in L^2(I)$.\n\nLet's check the first condition for $f(x)$ on $I=(0,2)$. The function $f(x)$ is bounded, since for any $x$, $0 \\le x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor < 1$, which implies $-\\frac{1}{2} \\le f(x) < \\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, $|f(x)| \\le \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe integral $\\int_0^2 |f(x)|^2 dx \\le \\int_0^2 (\\frac{1}{2})^2 dx = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 2 = \\frac{1}{2} < \\infty$.\nSo, $f \\in L^2(0,2)$. In general, for any bounded interval, $f$ is in $L^2$ on that interval. Therefore, $f \\in L^2_{loc}(\\mathbb{R})$.\n\nNow we analyze the second condition regarding the weak derivative. A key result in the theory of Sobolev spaces (a Sobolev embedding theorem) states that for an interval $I \\subset \\mathbb{R}$, any function $u \\in H^1(I)$ is equal almost everywhere to a continuous function on the closure of $I$. In other words, every function in $H^1(I)$ has a continuous representative.\n\nOur function $f(x)$, when restricted to the interval $I=(0,2)$, has a jump discontinuity at $x=1$. A function with a jump discontinuity cannot be made continuous by changing its value at a single point (or on a set of measure zero). If there were a continuous function $g(x)$ such that $g(x) = f(x)$ almost everywhere on $(0,2)$, then $g$ must match $f$ on $(0,1)$ and $(1,2)$. This would mean $\\lim_{x \\to 1^-} g(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 1^-} f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\lim_{x \\to 1^+} g(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 1^+} f(x) = -\\frac{1}{2}$. For $g$ to be continuous at $x=1$, these two limits must be equal, which they are not. Therefore, no continuous representative for $f(x)$ exists on the interval $(0,2)$.\n\nSince the restriction of $f$ to $I=(0,2)$ does not have a continuous representative, it cannot be an element of $H^1(0,2)$. Because we have found a bounded interval $I$ for which $f \\notin H^1(I)$, by definition, $f(x)$ is not in $H^1_{loc}(\\mathbb{R})$.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\nA. This is incorrect. Boundedness and periodicity are not sufficient. The Heaviside step function is bounded, and can be extended periodically, but it is not in $H^1_{loc}(\\mathbb{R})$ for the same reason as the sawtooth wave (discontinuities).\nB. This is a common misconception. The weak derivative is not always equal to the classical derivative, especially for discontinuous functions. The presence of jumps introduces distributional terms (in this case, Dirac delta functions) into the weak derivative which are not in $L^2$. The statement that $f'(x)=1$ a.e. is true, but this is not the full expression for the weak derivative.\nC. This is the correct reasoning. The Sobolev embedding theorem for one dimension guarantees that $H^1$ functions are continuous (after modification on a set of measure zero). Since the sawtooth wave has non-removable jump discontinuities, it cannot be in $H^1$ on any interval containing a jump. This failure on one such interval is enough to show it is not in $H^1_{loc}(\\mathbb{R})$.\nD. This is incorrect. The definition of $H^1_{loc}(\\mathbb{R})$ only requires the function to be in $L^2$ on *local* (i.e., bounded) intervals, not on the entire real line $\\mathbb{R}$. While it is true that $f \\notin L^2(\\mathbb{R})$, this is not the reason it fails to be in $H^1_{loc}(\\mathbb{R})$. As we showed, $f$ *is* in $L^2_{loc}(\\mathbb{R})$.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2114469"}]}
