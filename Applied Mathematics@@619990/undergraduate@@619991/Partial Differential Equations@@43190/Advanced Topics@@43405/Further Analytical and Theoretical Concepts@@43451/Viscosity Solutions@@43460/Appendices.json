Thus, for $r>0$, $-r(1+\\frac{1}{2}\\cos\\theta) \\le -r/2 < 0$. Since $u(0,0)-\\phi(0,0)=0$, this shows that $u-\\phi$ has a strict local maximum at $(0,0)$.\nFor this valid test function, $D\\phi(x,y) = (1/2, 0)$, so $D\\phi(0,0) = (1/2, 0)$ and $|D\\phi(0,0)| = 1/2$.\nThe subsolution inequality requires $|D\\phi(0,0)| \\le 0$, which is $1/2 \\le 0$.

Also $\\phi(tv) = \\phi(0) + t(D\\phi(0)\\cdot v) + o(t) = 1 + t(D\\phi(0)\\cdot v) + o(t)$.\nThe condition $u(tv) \\ge \\phi(tv)$ becomes $1-|t| \\ge 1 + t(D\\phi(0)\\cdot v) + o(t)$, which simplifies to $-|t| \\ge t(D\\phi(0)\\cdot v) + o(t)$.\nFor $t>0$ small: $-t \\ge t(D\\phi(0)\\cdot v) + o(t)$, which upon dividing by $t$ and taking the limit gives $-1 \\ge D\\phi(0)\\cdot v$.\nFor $t0$ small, $|t|=-t$: $-(-t) \\ge t(D\\phi(0)\\cdot v) + o(t)$, which is $t \\ge t(D\\phi(0)\\cdot v) + o(t)$.
