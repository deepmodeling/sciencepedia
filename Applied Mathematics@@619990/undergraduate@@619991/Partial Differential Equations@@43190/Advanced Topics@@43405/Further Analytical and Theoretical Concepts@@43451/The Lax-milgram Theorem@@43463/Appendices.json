The stability of the equilibrium depends on the properties of the associated bilinear form $B: H \\times H \\to \\mathbb{R}$. The system is stable if the form is positive semi-definite, and robustly stable if it is coercive.\n\nA bilinear form $B$ is:\n- **Symmetric** if $B(x, y) = B(y, x)$ for all $x, y \\in H$.\n- **Positive semi-definite** if $B(x, x) \\ge 0$ for all $x \\in H$.

It must be symmetric.\n2.  It must be positive semi-definite.\n3.  It must NOT be coercive.\n\nLet's analyze each option for vectors $x = (x_1, x_2)$ and $y = (y_1, y_2)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The norm is $\\|x\\|^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2$.\n\n**Option A: $B(x, y) = 2x_1 y_1 + 3x_2 y_2$**\n1.  **Symmetry**: $B(y, x) = 2y_1 x_1 + 3y_2 x_2 = B(x, y)$. This form is symmetric.\n2.  **Positive semi-definiteness**: $B(x, x) = 2x_1^2 + 3x_2^2$. Since squares of real numbers are non-negative, $B(x, x) \\ge 0$ for all $x$. This form is positive semi-definite.\n3.  **Coercivity**: We check if there exists $\\alpha > 0$ such that $B(x, x) \\ge \\alpha \\|x\\|^2$.\n    $B(x, x) = 2x_1^2 + 3x_2^2 \\ge 2x_1^2 + 2x_2^2 = 2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = 2\\|x\\|^2$.\n    We can choose $\\alpha = 2 > 0$.

This form is symmetric.\n2.  **Positive semi-definiteness**: $B(x, x) = x_1^2 - x_2^2$. To check if this is always non-negative, let's test a vector. Consider $x = (0, 1)$. Then $B(x, x) = 0^2 - 1^2 = -1$. Since $B(x, x) < 0$ for this vector, the form is not positive semi-definite.\n    This option fails the second condition.\n\n**Option C: $B(x, y) = x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_1$**\n1.  **Symmetry**: $B(y, x) = y_1 x_2 + y_2 x_1 = B(x, y)$. This form is symmetric.\n2.  **Positive semi-definiteness**: $B(x, x) = x_1 x_2 + x_2 x_1 = 2x_1 x_2$. Let's test a vector, for instance $x = (1, -1)$. Then $B(x, x) = 2(1)(-1) = -2$. Since $B(x, x) < 0$ for this vector, the form is not positive semi-definite.\n    This option fails the second condition.\n\n**Option D: $B(x, y) = x_1 y_2$**\n1.  **Symmetry**: $B(y, x) = y_1 x_2$. In general, $x_1 y_2 \\neq y_1 x_2$. For example, let $x=(1,0)$ and $y=(0,1)$. Then $B(x,y) = 1(1)=1$, but $B(y,x) = 0(0)=0$.

This form is symmetric.\n2.  **Positive semi-definiteness**: $B(x, x) = (x_1 + x_2)(x_1 + x_2) = (x_1 + x_2)^2$. Since this is the square of a real number, $B(x, x) \\ge 0$ for all $x$. This form is positive semi-definite.\n3.  **Coercivity**: We check if there exists $\\alpha > 0$ such that $B(x, x) \\ge \\alpha \\|x\\|^2$, which means we need $(x_1 + x_2)^2 \\ge \\alpha (x_1^2 + x_2^2)$ to hold for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n    To show it is not coercive, we need to find a non-zero vector $x$ for which this inequality cannot hold for any positive $\\alpha$. Let's search for a vector such that $B(x, x) = 0$. This occurs when $x_1 + x_2 = 0$, or $x_2 = -x_1$.\n    Consider the non-zero vector $x = (1, -1)$. For this vector:\n    $B(x, x) = (1 + (-1))^2 = 0^2 = 0$.\n    The norm squared is $\\|x\\|^2 = 1^2 + (-1)^2 = 2$.\n    The coercivity condition for this vector would be $0 \\ge \\alpha (2)$. Since coercivity requires $\\alpha > 0$, this inequality is false. Because we found a non-zero vector for which the condition fails, the bilinear form is not coercive.\n\nOption E is symmetric, positive semi-definite, and not coercive.
