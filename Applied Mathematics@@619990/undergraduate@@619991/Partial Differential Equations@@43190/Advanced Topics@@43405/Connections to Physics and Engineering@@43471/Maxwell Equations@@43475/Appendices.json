We will test the given field against each of Maxwell's equations under these vacuum conditions.\n\nThe components of the electric field are $E_x = 0$, $E_y = 0$, and $E_z = E_0 \\cos(kz - \\omega t)$.\n\n**A. Gauss's Law for electricity**\n\nIn a vacuum, where $\\rho = 0$, Gauss's Law becomes $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = 0$. Let's calculate the divergence of the given electric field:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = \\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial E_z}{\\partial z}\n$$\nSubstituting the components of our field:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = \\frac{\\partial (0)}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial (0)}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} [E_0 \\cos(kz - \\omega t)]\n$$\nThe only non-zero term is the partial derivative with respect to $z$:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = E_0 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} [\\cos(kz - \\omega t)] = E_0 [-k \\sin(kz - \\omega t)]\n$$\nSo, we find:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = -k E_0 \\sin(kz - \\omega t)\n$$\nSince $k$ and $E_0$ are non-zero, the divergence $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E}$ is generally not zero. However, Gauss's Law in a vacuum requires $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = 0$. This is a direct contradiction. Therefore, the proposed longitudinal electric field violates Gauss's Law for electricity.\n\nLet's briefly examine the other equations to confirm our understanding, although we have already found a violation.\n\n**B. Gauss's Law for magnetism**\n\nThis law, $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{B} = 0$, involves only the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$. It does not directly impose a constraint on $\\vec{E}$ by itself. We would first need to find a candidate for $\\vec{B}$. So, this law is not directly violated by the given $\\vec{E}$ field alone.\n\n**C. Faraday's Law of Induction**\n\nIn a vacuum, Faraday's Law is $\\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = - \\partial \\vec{B} / \\partial t$. Let's compute the curl of the given $\\vec{E}$ field:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = \\begin{vmatrix} \\hat{x} & \\hat{y} & \\hat{z} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\\\ E_x & E_y & E_z \\end{vmatrix} = \\begin{vmatrix} \\hat{x} & \\hat{y} & \\hat{z} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\\\ 0 & 0 & E_0 \\cos(kz - \\omega t) \\end{vmatrix}\n$$\nExpanding the determinant:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = \\hat{x} \\left( \\frac{\\partial E_z}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial z} \\right) - \\hat{y} \\left( \\frac{\\partial E_z}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial z} \\right) + \\hat{z} \\left( \\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial y} \\right)\n$$\nSince $E_z$ only depends on $z$ and $t$, its derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ are zero. Since $E_x$ and $E_y$ are zero, all their derivatives are zero. Thus, every term in the curl is zero:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = \\vec{0}\n$$\nSo, from Faraday's Law, we have $-\\partial \\vec{B} / \\partial t = \\vec{0}$. This implies that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ must be static (i.e., not a function of time). A time-independent magnetic field does not violate Faraday's Law with this $\\vec{E}$, so this law is not violated on its own.\n\n**D. The Ampère-Maxwell Law**\n\nIn a vacuum where $\\vec{J} = \\vec{0}$, this law is $\\nabla \\times \\vec{B} = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\partial \\vec{E} / \\partial t$.\nFrom our analysis of Faraday's Law, we concluded that for this $\\vec{E}$ to exist, the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ must be static, $\\vec{B} = \\vec{B}(\\vec{r})$. The curl of a static field, $\\nabla \\times \\vec{B}$, is also static (independent of time).\nNow let's look at the right-hand side of the Ampère-Maxwell equation.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\vec{E}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} [E_0 \\cos(kz - \\omega t) \\hat{z}] = E_0 [-\\sin(kz - \\omega t) \\cdot (-\\omega)] \\hat{z} = \\omega E_0 \\sin(kz - \\omega t) \\hat{z}\n$$\nSo the right-hand side is $\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\omega E_0 \\sin(kz - \\omega t) \\hat{z}$. This is a time-varying quantity.\nWe have a contradiction:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\vec{B}(\\vec{r}) = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\omega E_0 \\sin(kz - \\omega t) \\hat{z}\n$$\nA time-independent vector field (LHS) cannot be equal to a non-zero, time-dependent vector field (RHS). This shows there is also an inconsistency with the Ampère-Maxwell Law, but it arises from trying to satisfy Faraday's Law and the Ampère-Maxwell Law simultaneously.\n\nThe most direct and immediate violation is with Gauss's Law. The equation $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = 0$ is a condition on the electric field alone in a source-free region. The proposed longitudinal field fails this test directly, without any need to consider the magnetic field or any other laws.
