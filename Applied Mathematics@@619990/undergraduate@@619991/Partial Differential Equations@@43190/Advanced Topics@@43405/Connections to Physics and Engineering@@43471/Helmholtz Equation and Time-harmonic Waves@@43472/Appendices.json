The boundary conditions from $p(0,y,z)=0$ and $p(L,y,z)=0$ are $X(0)=0$ and $X(L)=0$.\nThe general solution is $X(x) = A \\cos(k_x x) + B \\sin(k_x x)$.\n$X(0)=0 \\implies A \\cos(0) + B \\sin(0) = A = 0$.\nThe solution is now $X(x) = B \\sin(k_x x)$.\n$X(L)=0 \\implies B \\sin(k_x L) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($B \\neq 0$), we must have $\\sin(k_x L) = 0$. This implies $k_x L = n_x \\pi$, where $n_x$ is an integer.\nThus, $k_x = \\frac{n_x \\pi}{L}$. Since $n_x=0$ yields the trivial solution $X(x)=0$, and negative integers give redundant solutions (up to a sign change in $B$), we take $n_x = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\n**2. The $y$-dimension (Neumann-Neumann):**\nThe ODE is $Y''(y) + k_y^2 Y(y) = 0$. The boundary conditions from $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y}|_{y=0}=0$ and $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y}|_{y=W}=0$ are $Y'(0)=0$ and $Y'(W)=0$.\nThe general solution is $Y(y) = C \\cos(k_y y) + D \\sin(k_y y)$.\nThe derivative is $Y'(y) = -C k_y \\sin(k_y y) + D k_y \\cos(k_y y)$.\n$Y'(0)=0 \\implies -C k_y \\sin(0) + D k_y \\cos(0) = D k_y = 0$.\nIf $k_y \\neq 0$, then $D=0$. The solution becomes $Y(y) = C \\cos(k_y y)$.\nApplying the second BC: $Y'(W)=0 \\implies -C k_y \\sin(k_y W) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($C \\neq 0, k_y \\neq 0$), we need $\\sin(k_y W) = 0$, so $k_y W = n_y \\pi$ for $n_y = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\nWhat if $k_y = 0$? The ODE becomes $Y''(y)=0$, with general solution $Y(y) = C'y + D'$. The BC $Y'(0)=0 \\implies C'=0$. The BC $Y'(W)=0$ is also satisfied by $C'=0$. So, $Y(y)=D'$ (a constant) is a valid non-trivial solution for $k_y=0$. This corresponds to $n_y=0$ in the formula $k_y = \\frac{n_y \\pi}{W}$.\nSo, for the y-dimension, $k_y = \\frac{n_y \\pi}{W}$ with $n_y = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\n**3. The $z$-dimension (Dirichlet-Neumann):**\nThe ODE is $Z''(z) + k_z^2 Z(z) = 0$. The boundary conditions are $Z(0)=0$ and $Z'(H)=0$.\nThe general solution is $Z(z) = E \\cos(k_z z) + F \\sin(k_z z)$.\n$Z(0)=0 \\implies E \\cos(0) + F \\sin(0) = E = 0$.\nThe solution is $Z(z) = F \\sin(k_z z)$.\nThe derivative is $Z'(z) = F k_z \\cos(k_z z)$.\n$Z'(H)=0 \\implies F k_z \\cos(k_z H) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($F \\neq 0$), we need $k_z \\cos(k_z H) = 0$. If $k_z=0$, $Z(z)=0$, a trivial solution. Therefore, we must have $\\cos(k_z H) = 0$.\nThis implies $k_z H = \\frac{(2n_z+1)\\pi}{2} = (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\pi$, where $n_z$ is an integer.\nThus, $k_z = \\frac{(2n_z+1)\\pi}{2H}$. For non-negative values of $k_z$, we take $n_z = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\n**Assembling the final result:**\nThe total wave number $k$ is given by $k^2 = k_x^2 + k_y^2 + k_z^2$. Substituting our expressions for $k_x, k_y, k_z$:\n$$\nk^2 = \\left(\\frac{n_x \\pi}{L}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{n_y \\pi}{W}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{(2n_z+1)\\pi}{2H}\\right)^2\n$$\nTaking the square root gives the expression for the allowed wave numbers, indexed by the integer mode numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$:\n$$\nk = \\sqrt{\\pi^2 \\left[ \\left(\\frac{n_x}{L}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{n_y}{W}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{2n_z+1}{2H}\\right)^2 \\right]}\n$$\n$$\nk = \\pi \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{n_x}{L}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{n_y}{W}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{2n_z+1}{2H}\\right)^2}\n$$\nwhere the mode numbers must be integers from the ranges we derived: $n_x \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$, $n_y \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\}$, and $n_z \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\}$. A non-trivial solution requires at least one mode number to result in a non-zero term. Since $n_x$ starts at 1, $k$ will always be non-zero, ensuring a non-trivial solution always exists for any valid set of integers.\nThe requested expression is therefore the one derived for $k$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\pi \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{n_x}{L}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{n_y}{W}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{2n_z+1}{2H}\\right)^2}}\n$$", "id": "2111730"}]}
