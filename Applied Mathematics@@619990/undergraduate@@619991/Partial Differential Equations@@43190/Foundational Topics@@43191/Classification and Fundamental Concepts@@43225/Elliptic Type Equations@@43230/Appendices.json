The equation is to be solved on a square domain $\\Omega = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : |x| < L, |y| < L\\}$ for some positive constant $L$. The value of the solution on the boundary $\\partial \\Omega$ is specified by the function $f(x,y) = C x^3$, where $C$ is a non-zero constant.\n\nWithout finding an explicit series or integral representation for the solution $u(x,y)$, one can deduce the value of the solution along the y-axis (the line $x=0$) by using an argument based on the symmetries of the problem and the uniqueness of the solution.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct and most direct line of reasoning to conclude that $u(0,y)=0$?\n\nA. Define a new function $v(x,y) = -u(-x,y)$. This function $v(x,y)$ also satisfies Laplace's equation on $\\Omega$. On the boundary, $v(x,y) = -u(-x,y) = -C(-x)^3 = C x^3 = f(x,y)$. By the uniqueness theorem for the Dirichlet problem, $v(x,y) = u(x,y)$. This implies $u(x,y) = -u(-x,y)$, so $u$ is an odd function of $x$ and must be zero for $x=0$.\n\nB. By the Maximum/Minimum Principle, the solution's extrema must occur on the boundary. The boundary function $f(x,y)=Cx^3$ has a maximum of $CL^3$ and a minimum of $-CL^3$. The y-axis ($x=0$) is the geometric midpoint between the lines $x=L$ and $x=-L$. Therefore, by the smoothing property of the Laplacian, the solution along the y-axis must be the average of the extreme boundary values, which is $(CL^3 - CL^3)/2 = 0$.\n\nC. The solution $u(x,y)$ must inherit the symmetries of the governing equation and the domain. Since both the Laplacian operator $\\nabla^2$ and the square domain $\\Omega$ are symmetric with respect to a reflection across the y-axis (the transformation $x \\to -x$), the solution must also be symmetric, i.e., $u(x,y) = u(-x,y)$. Evaluating at $x=0$ gives $u(0,y)=u(0,y)$, which provides no information about the value of the solution.\n\nD. The value of a harmonic function at a point is the average of its values on any circle centered at that point. For any point $(0,y)$ on the y-axis, consider a circle small enough to be within the domain. Since the boundary data $f(x,y)=Cx^3$ is positive for $x>0$ and negative for $x<0$, the values of $u(x,y)$ inside the domain will also tend to be positive for $x>0$ and negative for $x<0$.
