The temperature is calculated at discrete time steps $t_n = n\\Delta t$.\n\nThe temperature at an interior grid point $x_j$ at the next time step $t_{n+1}$ is determined from the temperatures at the current time step $t_n$ using the following update rule:\n$$u_j^{n+1} = u_j^n + \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} (u_{j-1}^n - 2u_j^n + u_{j+1}^n)$$\nwhere $u_j^n$ represents the temperature at position $x_j$ and time $t_n$.
