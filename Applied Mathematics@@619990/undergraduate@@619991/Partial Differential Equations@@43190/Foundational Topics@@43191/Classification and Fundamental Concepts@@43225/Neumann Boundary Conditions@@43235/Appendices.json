What happens when a wave encounters a \"free\" end, as opposed to a fixed one? This thought experiment [@problem_id:2156496] challenges you to connect the physical reality of wave reflection to the underlying mathematical boundary conditions. By contrasting a free end (a Neumann condition, representing zero force) with a fixed end (a Dirichlet condition, representing zero displacement), this practice deepens your physical intuition for why a wave crest reflects as a crest, not a trough.", "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional wave propagating along a long, flexible medium, such as a string, governed by the standard wave equation. The shape of the wave is described by its transverse displacement, $u(x,t)$. An incoming wave pulse, which is a crest, travels towards the boundary at $x=L$. When this crest reaches the boundary, it reflects. The nature of this reflection depends on the boundary condition at $x=L$.\n\nIt is observed that if the end at $x=L$ is fixed (e.g., tied to a wall), the crest reflects as a trough. In contrast, if the end at $x=L$ is free to move vertically (e.g., attached to a frictionless sliding ring on a pole), the crest reflects as a crest.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate physical and mathematical explanation for this difference in reflection behavior?\n\nA. At a fixed end, the boundary condition is zero slope, $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(L,t)=0$, because the point cannot pivot, which mathematically requires an inverted reflection. At a free end, the boundary condition is zero displacement, $u(L,t)=0$, as there is no support, which requires a non-inverted reflection.\n\nB. At a fixed end, the principle of conservation of energy requires the wave's potential energy to be converted to kinetic energy in the opposite direction, causing an inversion. At a free end, conservation of momentum dictates that the end of the string must move with twice the amplitude of the incoming wave, which results in a non-inverted reflection.\n\nC. At a fixed end, the boundary condition is zero displacement, $u(L,t)=0$, which can only be satisfied if the reflected wave is inverted to perfectly cancel the incident wave at that point. At a free end, the physical condition is zero vertical force, which for small displacements implies zero slope, $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(L,t)=0$. This slope condition is met when the reflected wave has the same sign as the incident wave.\n\nD. The reflection type is determined by Newton's third law. At a fixed end, the wall exerts a downward force in reaction to the string's upward pull, creating an inverted reflected pulse. At a free end, there is no external object to provide a reaction force, so the wave reflects on itself without inversion.\n\nE.
