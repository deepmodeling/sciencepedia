For a first-order quasi-linear PDE of the form $a(x,y,u)u_{x}+b(x,y,u)u_{y}=0$, the characteristic curves $(x(s),y(s),u(s))$ satisfy the system\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{ds}=a(x,y,u),\\quad \\frac{dy}{ds}=b(x,y,u),\\quad \\frac{du}{ds}=0.\n$$\nHere $a=y^{2}$ and $b=1$, so the characteristic ODEs are\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{ds}=y^{2},\\qquad \\frac{dy}{ds}=1,\\qquad \\frac{du}{ds}=0.\n$$\nFrom $\\frac{dy}{ds}=1$ we obtain $y=s+C_{1}$, so $s=y-C_{1}$.

Setting $y=0$ in $x-\\frac{y^{3}}{3}=C$ gives $x=C$. Thus, for each constant $C$, the characteristic intersects $y=0$ exactly at the point $(C,0)$, and conversely each point $(x_{0},0)$ lies on exactly one characteristic (namely the one with $C=x_{0}$). Hence each characteristic intersects $y=0$ at exactly one point.\n\nTo determine the tangent direction at the intersection, note that the tangent vector to a characteristic is $(\\frac{dx}{ds},\\frac{dy}{ds})=(y^{2},1)$. At $y=0$, this vector becomes $(0,1)$, which is vertical.
