We seek curves in the $(x,t)$ plane along which the PDE simplifies to an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Let's parameterize a characteristic curve by a parameter $s$, such that $x = x(s)$ and $t = t(s)$. The total derivative of the solution $u(x(s), t(s))$ with respect to $s$ is given by the chain rule:\n$$ \\frac{du}{ds} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\frac{dx}{ds} + \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} \\frac{dt}{ds} $$\nComparing this to the given PDE, we can define the characteristic curves by setting:\n$$ \\frac{dt}{ds} = 1 $$\n$$ \\frac{dx}{ds} = c $$\nWith this choice, the expression for $\\frac{du}{ds}$ becomes:\n$$ \\frac{du}{ds} = c \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} $$\nThis is exactly the left-hand side of the PDE. Therefore, along these characteristic curves, the PDE becomes the following simple ODE:\n$$ \\frac{du}{ds} = 0 $$\nNow, we solve this system of ODEs.\nFrom $\\frac{dt}{ds} = 1$, we can integrate to find $t(s) = s + k_1$. We can set the constant of integration $k_1=0$ without loss of generality by choosing $s=0$ when $t=0$. Thus, $t(s) = s$.\n\nFrom $\\frac{dx}{ds} = c$, we integrate to find $x(s) = cs + k_2$. Let's denote the initial position of the characteristic curve at $s=0$ (which corresponds to $t=0$) as $x_0$. Then $x(0) = c(0) + k_2 = x_0$, so $k_2 = x_0$. The equation for the characteristic curve is $x(s) = cs + x_0$. Substituting $s=t$, we get $x(t) = ct + x_0$. This can be rearranged to show that the quantity $x - ct = x_0$ is constant along a characteristic curve.\n\nFrom $\\frac{du}{ds} = 0$, we integrate to find that $u(s)$ is a constant. This means the value of the solution $u$ does not change along a characteristic curve. So, the value of $u$ at any point $(x, t)$ on a characteristic is the same as its value at the starting point of that characteristic on the $t=0$ axis, which is $(x_0, 0)$.\n$$ u(x, t) = u(x_0, 0) $$\nWe are given the initial condition $u(x, 0) = f(x) = C_0 \\cos^2(\\alpha x)$. Therefore, $u(x_0, 0) = f(x_0) = C_0 \\cos^2(\\alpha x_0)$.\nSubstituting $x_0 = x - ct$, we obtain the general solution for $u(x,t)$:\n$$ u(x, t) = f(x - ct) = C_0 \\cos^2(\\alpha (x - ct)) $$\nWe need to find the concentration at $x = 5.00 \\text{ m}$ and $t = 1.00 \\text{ s}$.
