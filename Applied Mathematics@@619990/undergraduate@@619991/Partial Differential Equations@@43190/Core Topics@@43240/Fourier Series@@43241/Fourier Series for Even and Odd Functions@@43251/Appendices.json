It is defined as the even periodic extension of $f(x)$ with period $T=2$. The period $T=2L$ implies that $L=1$.\n\nThe function $g(x)$ is constructed to be an even function, which means $g(-x) = g(x)$ for all $x$.\nOn the interval $[0, 1]$, we have $g(x) = f(x) = x-1$.\nUsing the even property, we can define the function on the interval $[-1, 0)$. For any $x$ in this interval, $-x$ is in $(0, 1]$. Therefore, $g(x) = g(-x) = f(-x) = (-x) - 1 = -x-1$.\nSo, over one full period from $x=-1$ to $x=1$, the function $g(x)$ is given by:\n$$\ng(x) = \\begin{cases}\n-x-1 & \\text{if } -1 \\leq x < 0 \\\\\nx-1 & \\text{if } 0 \\leq x \\leq 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis function is then extended periodically with period $T=2$. By its very construction, $g(x)$ is an even function.\n\nNow, let's examine the formulas for the Fourier coefficients. For a function with period $T=2L$, which is $T=2$ in our case ($L=1$), the coefficients are:\n$$a_n = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{-L}^{L} g(x) \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) dx = \\int_{-1}^{1} g(x) \\cos(n\\pi x) dx$$\n$$b_n = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{-L}^{L} g(x) \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) dx = \\int_{-1}^{1} g(x) \\sin(n\\pi x) dx$$\n\nWe need to determine which set of coefficients, if any, will be zero. This depends on the parity of the integrands.\nLet's analyze the integrand for the sine coefficients, $b_n$: The integrand is $g(x) \\sin(n\\pi x)$.\n- We know $g(x)$ is an even function.\n- The function $\\sin(n\\pi x)$ is an odd function, since $\\sin(-z) = -\\sin(z)$.\n- The product of an even function and an odd function is an odd function. Let $h(x) = g(x) \\sin(n\\pi x)$. Then $h(-x) = g(-x) \\sin(-n\\pi x) = g(x) [-\\sin(n\\pi x)] = -h(x)$.\n\nThe integral of any odd function over a symmetric interval, such as $[-L, L]$, is always zero.\nTherefore, for all $n \\geq 1$:\n$$b_n = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\underbrace{g(x) \\sin(n\\pi x)}_{\\text{odd function}} dx = 0$$\nThis means all the sine coefficients are zero. This matches statement D.\n\nTo be thorough, let's check the other options.\nLet's analyze the integrand for the cosine coefficients, $a_n$: The integrand is $g(x) \\cos(n\\pi x)$.\n- $g(x)$ is an even function.\n- $\\cos(n\\pi x)$ is an even function, since $\\cos(-z) = \\cos(z)$.\n- The product of two even functions is an even function.\n\nThe integral of an even function over a symmetric interval $[-L, L]$ is generally non-zero.
