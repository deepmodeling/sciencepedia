These functions are non-trivial solutions to a specific differential equation with associated boundary conditions. A key property of such a set is that the eigenfunctions are often mutually orthogonal with respect to a positive weight function $w(x)$ on the interval $[a, b]$. This orthogonality is defined by the relation:\n$$ \\int_a^b y_n(x) y_m(x) w(x) dx = 0 \\quad \\text{for } n \\neq m $$\nFurthermore, such a set of eigenfunctions is said to be *complete* if any reasonably well-behaved function, specifically any square-integrable function $f(x)$ on $[a, b]$, can be represented as a unique generalized Fourier series expansion in terms of these eigenfunctions:\n$$ f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} c_n y_n(x) $$\nwhere the coefficients $c_n$ are constants.\n\nNow, consider a specific square-integrable function $g(x)$ defined on the interval $[a, b]$. This function has the particular property that it is orthogonal to *every* eigenfunction $y_n(x)$ from the complete set. That is,\n$$ \\int_a^b g(x) y_n(x) w(x) dx = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots $$\nBased on this information, what can be definitively concluded about the function $g(x)$ on the interval $[a,b]$?\n\nA.

The problem statement specifies that a complete set of eigenfunctions $\\{y_n(x)\\}$ can be used to represent any square-integrable function $g(x)$ as a generalized Fourier series:\n$$ g(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} c_k y_k(x) $$\nOur goal is to determine the coefficients $c_k$ for the function $g(x)$.\n\nTo find a specific coefficient, say $c_n$, we utilize the orthogonality property of the eigenfunctions. We multiply both sides of the series expansion for $g(x)$ by $y_n(x)w(x)$ and integrate over the interval $[a, b]$:\n$$ \\int_a^b g(x) y_n(x) w(x) dx = \\int_a^b \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} c_k y_k(x) \\right) y_n(x) w(x) dx $$\nAssuming the series converges in a way that allows us to interchange the summation and integration, we have:\n$$ \\int_a^b g(x) y_n(x) w(x) dx = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} c_k \\int_a^b y_k(x) y_n(x) w(x) dx $$\nThe orthogonality relation is given as $\\int_a^b y_k(x) y_n(x) w(x) dx = 0$ for $k \\neq n$. This means that every term in the summation on the right-hand side is zero, except for the term where $k=n$. Therefore, the equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\int_a^b g(x) y_n(x) w(x) dx = c_n \\int_a^b [y_n(x)]^2 w(x) dx $$\nFrom this, we can express the coefficient $c_n$ as:\n$$ c_n = \\frac{\\int_a^b g(x) y_n(x) w(x) dx}{\\int_a^b [y_n(x)]^2 w(x) dx} $$\nThe denominator, $\\int_a^b [y_n(x)]^2 w(x) dx$, is the square of the norm of the eigenfunction $y_n(x)$. Since eigenfunctions are defined as non-trivial (i.e., not the zero function) and the weight function $w(x)$ is positive, this integral is strictly positive.\n\nNow, we use the crucial piece of information provided in the problem statement: the function $g(x)$ is orthogonal to *every* eigenfunction $y_n(x)$. This means:\n$$ \\int_a^b g(x) y_n(x) w(x) dx = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } n $$\nThis is precisely the numerator in our expression for the coefficient $c_n$. Substituting this into our formula for $c_n$, we find:\n$$ c_n = \\frac{0}{\\int_a^b [y_n(x)]^2 w(x) dx} = 0 $$\nThis holds for all values of $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$. Thus, every single coefficient in the Fourier series expansion of $g(x)$ is zero.\n\nFinally, we substitute these zero coefficients back into the series expansion for $g(x)$:\n$$ g(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} (0) \\cdot y_k(x) = 0 $$\nThis means the function $g(x)$ must be the zero function. In the context of square-integrable functions, this conclusion holds \"almost everywhere,\" meaning it can be non-zero only on a set of measure zero. This corresponds to option A.\n\nLet's analyze why the other options are incorrect:\n- B: If $g(x)=C$ (a non-zero constant), then its inner product with at least one eigenfunction would be non-zero (unless $C=0$), violating the given condition.\n- C: If $g(x) = y_k(x)$, its inner product with $y_k(x)$ would be $\\int_a^b [y_k(x)]^2 w(x) dx > 0$, again violating the condition.\n- D: The properties are not contradictory; they lead to a unique conclusion.\n- E: This contradicts the definition of completeness, which guarantees that such a function *can* be represented by the series.
