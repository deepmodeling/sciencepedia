Express your answer as a single closed-form analytic expression.", "solution": "The problem asks us to find a specific function $f(x)$ and then use it to compute an integral. We'll follow a multi-step process to determine $f(x)$ and then evaluate the integral.\n\nFirst, we identify the function $f(x)$ based on the given properties.\nThe function $f(x)$ must be a solution to the Sturm-Liouville problem $f''(x) + \\lambda f(x) = 0$ with boundary conditions $f(0)=0$ and $f(\\pi)=0$. The general solution to this ordinary differential equation depends on the sign of $\\lambda$. Assuming $\\lambda > 0$, let $\\lambda = k^2$ for some $k>0$. The general solution is $f(x) = A \\cos(kx) + B \\sin(kx)$.\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n1. $f(0) = 0 \\implies A \\cos(0) + B \\sin(0) = A \\cdot 1 + B \\cdot 0 = A = 0$.\nSo the solution must be of the form $f(x) = B \\sin(kx)$.\n\n2. $f(\\pi) = 0 \\implies B \\sin(k\\pi) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution, we must have $B \\neq 0$, which implies $\\sin(k\\pi) = 0$. This condition is met when $k\\pi = m\\pi$ for any integer $m$. Since $k>0$, $m$ must be a positive integer, $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$. Thus, $k=m$.\n\nThe eigenfunctions of the Sturm-Liouville problem are of the form $f_m(x) = B_m \\sin(mx)$ for $m=1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\n\nNext, we use the orthogonality condition. The function $f(x)$ must be orthogonal to every function in the set $S = \\{\\sin(nx) \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}, n \\ge 2\\}$. This means $\\langle f(x), \\sin(nx) \\rangle = 0$ for all integers $n \\ge 2$.\nLet our function be $f(x) = B_m \\sin(mx)$ for some positive integer $m$. The orthogonality condition is:\n$$\n\\langle B_m \\sin(mx), \\sin(nx) \\rangle = B_m \\int_0^\\pi \\sin(mx) \\sin(nx) dx = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } n \\ge 2.\n$$\nThe set of functions $\\{\\sin(jx)\\}_{j=1}^\\infty$ is an orthogonal set on $[0, \\pi]$. The value of the integral $\\int_0^\\pi \\sin(mx) \\sin(nx) dx$ is non-zero only if $m=n$. Since the condition must hold for all $n \\in \\{2, 3, 4, \\dots\\}$, our chosen integer $m$ cannot be any of these values. The only positive integer not in the set $\\{2, 3, 4, \\dots\\}$ is $m=1$.\nTherefore, the function $f(x)$ must be of the form $f(x) = B_1 \\sin(x)$.\n\nNow, we use the normalization condition to find the constant $B_1$. The maximum value of $f(x)$ on $[0, \\pi]$ is given as $\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}}$.\nThe function is $f(x) = B_1 \\sin(x)$. On the interval $[0, \\pi]$, $\\sin(x)$ is non-negative and its maximum value is $\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$. Thus, the maximum value of $f(x)$ is $|B_1|$. Assuming $B_1$ is positive to match the positive value of $\\sin(x)$ on the interval, the maximum is $B_1$.\nWe are given that this maximum is $\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}}$, so $B_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}}$.\nThe uniquely determined function is $f(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}} \\sin(x)$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the integral $I = \\int_0^\\pi x^2 f(x) dx$.\n$$\nI = \\int_0^\\pi x^2 \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}} \\sin(x)\\right) dx = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}} \\int_0^\\pi x^2 \\sin(x) dx\n$$\nWe evaluate the definite integral $\\int_0^\\pi x^2 \\sin(x) dx$ using integration by parts twice.\nLet $u = x^2$ and $dv = \\sin(x)dx$.
