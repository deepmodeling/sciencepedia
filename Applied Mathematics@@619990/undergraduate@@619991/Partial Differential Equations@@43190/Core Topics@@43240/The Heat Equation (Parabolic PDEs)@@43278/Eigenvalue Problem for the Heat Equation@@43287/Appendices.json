An insulated end at $x=0$ means the heat flux is zero. Heat flux is proportional to the spatial derivative of temperature, so $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(0, t) = 0$. Since $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$, this implies $X'(0)T(t) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution, $T(t)$ cannot be zero for all $t$, so we must have $X'(0) = 0$.\n2.
