The primary method to solve this is to apply the Fourier transform to the partial differential equation (PDE), which converts it into an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that is easier to solve.\n\nStep 1: Apply the Fourier transform to the heat equation.\nWe start with the heat equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} $$\nWe take the Fourier transform of both sides with respect to the spatial variable $x$.

We can solve it by separation of variables or by recognizing its standard solution form. The solution is:\n$$ \\hat{u}(\\omega, t) = C(\\omega) \\exp(-\\alpha \\omega^2 t) $$\nThe \"constant\" of integration, $C(\\omega)$, can depend on the parameter $\\omega$. We determine $C(\\omega)$ using the initial condition at $t=0$.\n\nStep 3: Apply the initial condition.\nAt $t=0$, the solution becomes $\\hat{u}(\\omega, 0) = C(\\omega) \\exp(0) = C(\\omega)$. So, we need to find the Fourier transform of the initial temperature distribution, $u(x,0)$.\nThe initial condition is $u(x,0) = A \\cos(\\omega_0 x)$.\nTo find its Fourier transform, we first express the cosine function using Euler's formula, $\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{e^{i\\theta} + e^{-i\\theta}}{2}$:\n$$ u(x,0) = A \\left( \\frac{e^{i\\omega_0 x} + e^{-i\\omega_0 x}}{2} \\right) $$\nNow we take the Fourier transform:\n$$ \\hat{u}(\\omega, 0) = \\mathcal{F}[u(x,0)] = \\frac{A}{2} \\mathcal{F}[e^{i\\omega_0 x} + e^{-i\\omega_0 x}] = \\frac{A}{2} (\\mathcal{F}[e^{i\\omega_0 x}] + \\mathcal{F}[e^{-i\\omega_0 x}]) $$\nThe Fourier transform of a complex exponential $e^{iax}$ is related to the Dirac delta function.

Substituting this into our general solution for $\\hat{u}(\\omega, t)$:\n$$ \\hat{u}(\\omega, t) = A\\pi [\\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) + \\delta(\\omega + \\omega_0)] \\exp(-\\alpha \\omega^2 t) $$\nThis expression can be simplified by using the property of the Dirac delta function, $f(\\omega)\\delta(\\omega-a) = f(a)\\delta(\\omega-a)$.\nApplying this property to each term in the sum:\nThe term with $\\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0)$ becomes:\n$$ \\exp(-\\alpha \\omega^2 t) \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) = \\exp(-\\alpha \\omega_0^2 t) \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) $$\nThe term with $\\delta(\\omega + \\omega_0)$ becomes:\n$$ \\exp(-\\alpha \\omega^2 t) \\delta(\\omega + \\omega_0) = \\exp(-\\alpha (-\\omega_0)^2 t) \\delta(\\omega + \\omega_0) = \\exp(-\\alpha \\omega_0^2 t) \\delta(\\omega + \\omega_0) $$\nNotice that the exponential factor is the same for both terms.
