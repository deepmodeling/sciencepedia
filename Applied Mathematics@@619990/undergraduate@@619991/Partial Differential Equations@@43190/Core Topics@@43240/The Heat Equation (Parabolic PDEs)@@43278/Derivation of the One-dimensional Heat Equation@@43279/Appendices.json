Each mass is $m$ and has a specific heat capacity $c$. The masses are equally spaced. The rod is placed between two large heat reservoirs. The left end, at index $i=0$, is held at a constant temperature $T_L$. The right end, at index $i=N+1$, is held at a constant temperature $T_R$.\n\nHeat can flow between adjacent masses. The physical law governing this heat transfer is analogous to Newton's law of cooling: the rate of heat energy flow from mass $j$ to mass $i$ is given by $\\frac{dQ}{dt} = \\kappa(T_j - T_i)$, where $T_i$ and $T_j$ are the temperatures of the respective masses and $\\kappa$ is a positive constant representing the thermal coupling. Assume there is no heat loss to the surrounding environment, so masses only exchange heat with their nearest neighbors. The thermal energy of a single mass $i$ is related to its temperature $T_i$ by $U_i = mcT_i$.\n\nAfter a sufficiently long time, the system reaches a steady state where the temperatures of the masses no longer change.

This isotope acts as an internal heat source, generating heat throughout the volume of the rod.
