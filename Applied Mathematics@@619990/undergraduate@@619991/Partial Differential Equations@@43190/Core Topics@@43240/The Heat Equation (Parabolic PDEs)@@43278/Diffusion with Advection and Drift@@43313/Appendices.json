A species of protein is distributed along this filament with a concentration $u(x, t)$, which depends on position $x$ and time $t$. The proteins are subject to three transport phenomena: diffusion, advection, and drift.\n\n1.  The proteins undergo random thermal motion, which can be modeled as Fickian diffusion with a constant diffusion coefficient $D > 0$.\n2.  The filament is situated within a cellular environment where there is a bulk cytoplasmic flow, resulting in a constant advection velocity of $c > 0$ in the positive x-direction for all proteins.\n3.  The proteins are a type of motor protein that actively moves along the filament. This directed motion constitutes a drift velocity, $v$. For this particular system, the drift velocity is constant and directed toward the origin with a magnitude exactly equal to the advection velocity. Thus, the drift velocity is $v = -c$.\n\nThe ends of the filament are connected to reservoirs that maintain fixed protein concentrations. At $x=0$, the concentration is held at $u(0, t) = u_0$. At $x=L$, the concentration is held at $u(L, t) = u_L$.\n\nAfter a sufficiently long time, the system reaches a steady-state concentration profile.

The net velocity $V$ is the sum of the advection velocity $c$ and the drift velocity $v$.\n$$\nV = c + v\n$$\nThe problem states that $v = -c$. Therefore, the net velocity is:\n$$\nV = c + (-c) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the constant $D$ and the net velocity $V=0$ into the governing PDE, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (0 \\cdot u)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the steady-state concentration profile, which is the profile after a long time when the concentration no longer changes with time. This implies that $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = 0$. The concentration $u$ becomes a function of position $x$ only, so we can write it as $u(x)$ and use ordinary derivatives. The PDE simplifies to an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE):\n$$\n0 = D \\frac{d^2 u}{d x^2}\n$$\nSince the diffusion coefficient $D$ is a positive constant ($D > 0$), this equation requires that:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 u}{d x^2} = 0\n$$\nThis is a simple second-order linear homogeneous ODE. We can solve it by integrating twice with respect to $x$.\nIntegrating once gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d u}{d x} = C_1\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration.\nIntegrating a second time gives the general solution for the concentration profile:\n$$\nu(x) = C_1 x + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_2$ is a second constant of integration.\n\nTo find the specific values of $C_1$ and $C_2$, we apply the boundary conditions given in the problem statement.\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1.  $u(0) = u_0$\n2.  $u(L) = u_L$\n\nApplying the first boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$\nu(0) = C_1 (0) + C_2 = u_0\n$$\nThis directly gives $C_2 = u_0$.\n\nNow, we substitute $C_2 = u_0$ back into the general solution:\n$$\nu(x) = C_1 x + u_0\n$$\nApplying the second boundary condition at $x=L$:\n$$\nu(L) = C_1 L + u_0 = u_L\n$$\nWe can now solve for $C_1$:\n$$\nC_1 L = u_L - u_0\n$$\n$$\nC_1 = \\frac{u_L - u_0}{L}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for $C_1$ and $C_2$ back into the general solution $u(x) = C_1 x + C_2$ to obtain the specific solution for the steady-state concentration profile:\n$$\nu(x) = \\left( \\frac{u_L - u_0}{L} \\right) x + u_0\n$$\nThis shows that when the advection and drift velocities exactly cancel, the steady-state profile is a simple linear interpolation between the boundary concentrations, which is the characteristic profile of pure diffusion in steady state.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{u_{0} + \\frac{(u_{L} - u_{0})x}{L}}$$", "id": "2096190"}, {"introduction": "Having established the pure diffusion baseline, we now introduce a net advective flow.

A coolant fluid flows with a constant velocity $v$ along a narrow microchannel of length $L$. We can model this channel as a one-dimensional interval extending from $x=0$ to $x=L$. In this system, heat is transported along the channel by two primary mechanisms: advection (convection) due to the bulk fluid motion and diffusion (conduction) through the fluid.

The boundary at the inlet, $x=0$, is perfectly thermally insulated. In the context of combined advection and diffusion, this insulation implies that the total heat flux across the boundary is zero.
