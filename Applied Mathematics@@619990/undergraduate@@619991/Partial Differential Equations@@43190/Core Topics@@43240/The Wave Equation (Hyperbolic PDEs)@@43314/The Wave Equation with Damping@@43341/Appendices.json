The string is submerged in a medium that provides a damping force proportional to the velocity of any point on the string.

The governing Partial Differential Equation (PDE) is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} + \\alpha \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} $$\nwith boundary conditions $u(0, t) = 0$, $u(\\pi, t) = 0$, and initial conditions $u(x, 0) = \\sin(2x)$, $u_t(x, 0) = 0$.\n\nWe use the method of separation of variables, assuming a solution of the form $u(x, t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the PDE gives:\n$$ X(x)T''(t) + \\alpha X(x)T'(t) = c^2 X''(x)T(t) $$\nDividing by $c^2 X(x)T(t)$ allows us to separate the variables:\n$$ \\frac{T''(t) + \\alpha T'(t)}{c^2 T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} $$\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side only on $x$, both must be equal to a constant, which we denote as $-\\lambda$. This yields two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n1. Spatial equation: $X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0$\n2. Temporal equation: $T''(t) + \\alpha T'(t) + \\lambda c^2 T(t) = 0$\n\nFirst, we solve the spatial equation with its boundary conditions. The boundary conditions $u(0, t) = X(0)T(t) = 0$ and $u(\\pi, t) = X(\\pi)T(t) = 0$ imply that $X(0) = 0$ and $X(\\pi) = 0$ for a non-trivial solution ($T(t) \\not\\equiv 0$).\nThe general solution to $X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0$ for $\\lambda > 0$ is $X(x) = A \\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x) + B \\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$.\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n$X(0) = A \\cos(0) + B \\sin(0) = A = 0$.\n$X(\\pi) = B \\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\pi) = 0$.\nFor a non-trivial solution, we must have $B \\neq 0$, which requires $\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\pi) = 0$.

This means $T_n(0) = 0$ for $n \\neq 2$, and $T_2(0) = 1$. The solution is thus a single mode corresponding to $n=2$.\n$$ u(x, t) = T_2(t) \\sin(2x) $$\nFor this mode ($n=2$), the temporal ODE is $T_2''(t) + \\alpha T_2'(t) + 4c^2 T_2(t) = 0$.
