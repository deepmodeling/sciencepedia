This first practice focuses on the physical interpretation of initial conditions. By comparing two common scenarios—plucking a string versus striking it—you will learn to connect the abstract mathematical statements $u(x,0)=f(x)$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0)=g(x)$ to tangible physical actions [@problem_id:2113070].", "problem": "The motion of a vibrating string of length $L$ fixed at both ends is described by the one-dimensional wave equation, $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$, where $u(x, t)$ is the vertical displacement of the string at position $x$ and time $t$, and $c$ is the wave propagation speed. The state of the string at $t=0$ is determined by its initial displacement and initial velocity.\n\nConsider two distinct physical scenarios:\n\n1.  **The Plucked String:** A harpist pulls the center of a string upwards into a triangular shape and then releases it from rest at time $t=0$.\n\n2.  **The Struck String:** A pianist presses a key, causing a small, localized hammer to strike a string that is initially in its straight-line equilibrium position. The impact occurs at time $t=0$ and imparts a velocity profile to the string.\n\nNow, consider two sets of mathematical initial conditions, where $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are non-zero functions describing the initial shape and velocity profile, respectively.\n\n-   **Set I:**  $u(x, 0) = f(x)$, $\\quad \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x, 0) = 0$\n-   **Set II:** $u(x, 0) = 0$, $\\quad \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x, 0) = g(x)$\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly matches the physical scenarios with their corresponding mathematical initial conditions?\n\nA.

The Struck String is modeled by Set II, but the Plucked String cannot be modeled by either set.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must interpret the physical meaning of the initial conditions for the wave equation and relate them to the described scenarios.\n\nThe function $u(x,t)$ represents the displacement of the string from its equilibrium position (the horizontal axis) at a point $x$ and time $t$.\nThe two initial conditions are:\n1.  $u(x, 0) = f(x)$: This specifies the initial displacement or shape of the string at the starting time, $t=0$.\n2.  $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x, 0) = g(x)$: This specifies the initial velocity of each point on the string at the starting time, $t=0$. The partial derivative of displacement with respect to time, $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}$, is the velocity.\n\nLet's analyze each physical scenario.\n\n**Scenario 1: The Plucked String**\nThe description states that the harpist \"pulls the center of a string upwards into a triangular shape\". This means that at the moment of release, $t=0$, the string is not in its flat equilibrium position. It has a specific, non-zero shape. This corresponds to a non-zero initial displacement function. Mathematically, this is represented by $u(x, 0) = f(x)$, where $f(x)$ is a function describing the triangular shape and is not identically zero.\n\nThe description then states that the string is \"releases it from rest\". \"From rest\" means that at the exact moment of release, the velocity of every point on the string is zero. Mathematically, this is represented by setting the initial velocity to zero for all $x$: $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x, 0) = 0$.\n\nCombining these two observations, the plucked string scenario is modeled by the conditions:\n$u(x, 0) = f(x)$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x, 0) = 0$.\nThis perfectly matches **Set I**.\n\n**Scenario 2: The Struck String**\nThe description states that the hammer strikes a string \"that is initially in its straight-line equilibrium position\". The equilibrium position corresponds to zero displacement. This means that at the moment of impact, $t=0$, the displacement of the string is zero everywhere. Mathematically, this is represented as $u(x, 0) = 0$.\n\nThe description then states that the impact \"imparts a velocity profile to the string\". This means that the hammer strike causes the points on the string to start moving, giving them a non-zero initial velocity. The profile of this velocity along the string is described by some function $g(x)$, which will be non-zero at least in the region of the hammer strike. Mathematically, this is represented as $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x, 0) = g(x)$, where $g(x)$ is not identically zero.\n\nCombining these two observations, the struck string scenario is modeled by the conditions:\n$u(x, 0) = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x, 0) = g(x)$.\nThis perfectly matches **Set II**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n- The Plucked String scenario corresponds to Set I.\n- The Struck String scenario corresponds to Set II.\n\nThis leads us to select the option stating that the Plucked String is modeled by Set I, and the Struck String is modeled by Set II.

The small transverse vibrations of this string, denoted by the displacement function $u(x, t)$, are governed by the one-dimensional wave equation. Here, $x$ is the position along the circumference of the ring, with $x \\in [0, L]$, and $t$ is time. The wave equation is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nwhere $c$ is a positive constant representing the wave propagation speed.\n\nUsing the method of separation of variables, we assume a solution of the form $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$.

The associated angular frequency is $\\omega=c\\sqrt{\\lambda_{0}}=0$, so there is no restoring oscillation; physically this is a zero-frequency (neutral) mode. For a bounded stationary mode shape, one takes $a=0$, yielding a spatially uniform, time-independent displacement $u(x,t)\\equiv Bb$. On a ring, a uniform transverse displacement means every point is displaced by the same amount along its local transverse direction, preserving circular symmetry and yielding a new stationary circular shape. Therefore, the correct physical interpretation is that the entire string is uniformly displaced from its equilibrium circle to a new, stationary circular shape.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2125305"}, {"introduction": "Real-world physical systems often exhibit complexities that linear models cannot capture. This final practice moves beyond the idealized wave equation to the nonlinear Kirchhoff model, where the string's tension is not constant but depends on its own stretching.
