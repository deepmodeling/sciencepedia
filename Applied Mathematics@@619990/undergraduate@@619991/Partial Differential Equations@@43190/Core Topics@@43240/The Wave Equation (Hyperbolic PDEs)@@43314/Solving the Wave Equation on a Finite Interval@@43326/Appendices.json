The transverse displacement of any point on the string at position $x$ and time $t$ is given by the function $u(x,t)$. The motion of the string is governed by the one-dimensional wave equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nwhere $c$ is a positive constant representing the speed of wave propagation along the string.\n\nAt time $t=0$, the string is perfectly straight, coinciding with the x-axis.

We assume a solution of the form $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the wave equation gives:\n$$X(x)T''(t) = c^2 X''(x)T(t)$$\nDividing by $c^2 X(x)T(t)$, we can separate the variables:\n$$\\frac{T''(t)}{c^2 T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -k^2$$\nwhere $-k^2$ is the separation constant. This leads to two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n1.  Spatial ODE: $X''(x) + k^2 X(x) = 0$\n2.  Temporal ODE: $T''(t) + (ck)^2 T(t) = 0$\n\nFirst, we solve the spatial ODE for $X(x)$ subject to the boundary conditions. The general solution is $X(x) = A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx)$.\nApplying the BC $u(0,t)=0$, which implies $X(0)=0$:\n$$X(0) = A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0) = A = 0$$\nSo, the solution becomes $X(x) = B\\sin(kx)$.\nApplying the BC $u(L,t)=0$, which implies $X(L)=0$:\n$$X(L) = B\\sin(kL) = 0$$\nFor a non-trivial solution ($B \\neq 0$), we must have $\\sin(kL) = 0$. This implies that $kL = n\\pi$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\nThus, the eigenvalues are $k_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}$, and the corresponding eigenfunctions are:\n$$X_n(x) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we solve the temporal ODE for each $k_n$:\n$$T_n''(t) + \\left(\\frac{n\\pi c}{L}\\right)^2 T_n(t) = 0$$\nThe general solution for $T_n(t)$ is:\n$$T_n(t) = C_n \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi c t}{L}\\right) + D_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi c t}{L}\\right)$$\n\nBy the principle of superposition, the general solution for $u(x,t)$ is a sum over all possible modes:\n$$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} X_n(x)T_n(t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(C_n \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi c t}{L}\\right) + D_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi c t}{L}\\right)\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$$\n\nNext, we use the initial conditions to find the coefficients $C_n$ and $D_n$.\nUsing the first IC, $u(x,0) = 0$:\n$$u(x,0) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(C_n \\cos(0) + D_n \\sin(0)\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) = 0$$\nThis is a Fourier sine series that equals zero everywhere on the interval.

The specific solution for the displacement is:\n$$u(x,t) = D_1 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi c t}{L}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) = \\frac{V_0 L}{\\pi c} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi c t}{L}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$$\n\nFinally, we need to find the displacement at the midpoint of the string, $x = L/2$, at the specified time, $t = L/(2c)$.
