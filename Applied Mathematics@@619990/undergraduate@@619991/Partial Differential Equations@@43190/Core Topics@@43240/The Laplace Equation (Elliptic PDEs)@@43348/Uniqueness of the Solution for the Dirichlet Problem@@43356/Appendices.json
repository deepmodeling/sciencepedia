The rod occupies the region $x \\in [a, b]$, where $a$ and $b$ are positions with $b > a$. In the absence of internal heat sources, the temperature profile is governed by the one-dimensional Laplace equation, $u''(x) = 0$. The ends of the rod are maintained at fixed, known temperatures: $u(a) = A$ and $u(b) = B$.\n\nTo confirm that the mathematical model yields a single, predictable temperature distribution, you are asked to investigate its uniqueness. Assume, for the sake of argument, that two different functions, $u_1(x)$ and $u_2(x)$, could both be valid solutions. This means that both functions satisfy the same differential equation and the same boundary conditions.\n\nDefine a difference function $w(x) = u_1(x) - u_2(x)$.

The differential equation: $u_1''(x) = 0$ for $x \\in (a, b)$.\n2.  The boundary conditions: $u_1(a) = A$ and $u_1(b) = B$.\n\nFor $u_2(x)$:\n1.  The differential equation: $u_2''(x) = 0$ for $x \\in (a, b)$.\n2.  The boundary conditions: $u_2(a) = A$ and $u_2(b) = B$.\n\nNext, we establish the differential equation that the difference function $w(x) = u_1(x) - u_2(x)$ must satisfy. Since the differentiation operator is linear, we can write:\n$$w''(x) = \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}(u_1(x) - u_2(x)) = \\frac{d^2 u_1}{dx^2} - \\frac{d^2 u_2}{dx^2}$$\nSubstituting the governing equations for $u_1$ and $u_2$:\n$$w''(x) = 0 - 0 = 0$$\nSo, the difference function $w(x)$ also satisfies the same homogeneous differential equation.\n\nNow, we determine the boundary conditions for $w(x)$.\nAt $x=a$:\n$$w(a) = u_1(a) - u_2(a) = A - A = 0$$\nAt $x=b$:\n$$w(b) = u_1(b) - u_2(b) = B - B = 0$$\nSo, $w(x)$ must satisfy homogeneous boundary conditions, i.e., $w(a)=0$ and $w(b)=0$.\n\nWe now solve the boundary value problem for $w(x)$: $w''(x)=0$ with $w(a)=0$ and $w(b)=0$.\nWe find the general solution for $w(x)$ by integrating $w''(x)=0$ twice with respect to $x$.\nIntegrating once gives:\n$$w'(x) = C_1$$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration.\nIntegrating a second time gives:\n$$w(x) = C_1 x + C_2$$\nwhere $C_2$ is a second constant of integration. This is the general solution for $w(x)$.\n\nTo find the specific solution, we apply the boundary conditions for $w(x)$.\nUsing $w(a)=0$:\n$$C_1 a + C_2 = 0 \\quad (1)$$\nUsing $w(b)=0$:\n$$C_1 b + C_2 = 0 \\quad (2)$$\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for the two unknown constants $C_1$ and $C_2$. To solve this system, we can subtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n$$(C_1 b + C_2) - (C_1 a + C_2) = 0 - 0$$\n$$C_1 b - C_1 a = 0$$\n$$C_1 (b-a) = 0$$\nThe problem specifies that the rod exists on an interval $[a, b]$ with $b > a$, which means $b-a \\neq 0$. For the product $C_1(b-a)$ to be zero, it must be that $C_1=0$.\n\nNow, substitute $C_1=0$ back into equation (1):\n$$(0)a + C_2 = 0$$\n$$C_2 = 0$$\n\nSince both constants of integration are zero, the function $w(x)$ is:\n$$w(x) = (0)x + 0 = 0$$\nThis holds for all $x$ in the interval $[a, b]$. The fact that $w(x) = u_1(x) - u_2(x) = 0$ implies that $u_1(x)=u_2(x)$, demonstrating that the solution to the original boundary value problem is unique.
