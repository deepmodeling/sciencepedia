On a vertical edge $x = \\text{constant}$, the outward normal is in the $\\pm x$ direction, so $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial n}$ is $\\pm u_{x}$. Since the condition is homogeneous, it reduces to $u_{x} = 0$ along that edge.

Thus the Neumann condition fails on $x=0$.\n- On $x = a$: $u_{x}(a,y) = 3a^{2} - 3y^{2}$, which is not identically zero for $y \\in [0,b]$ unless $y = a$, hence it fails on $x=a$ for arbitrary $a,b>0$.\n- On $y = 0$: $u_{y}(x,0) = -6x\\cdot 0 = 0$ for all $x \\in [0,a]$, so the Neumann condition is satisfied on $y=0$.\n- On $y = b$: $u_{y}(x,b) = -6xb$, which is not zero for general $x \\in (0,a]$ when $b>0$, so it fails on $y=b$.\n\nTherefore, while $u$ satisfies Laplace’s equation, it satisfies the homogeneous Neumann boundary condition only on the edge $y=0$ and fails it on $x=0$, $x=a$, and $y=b$.
