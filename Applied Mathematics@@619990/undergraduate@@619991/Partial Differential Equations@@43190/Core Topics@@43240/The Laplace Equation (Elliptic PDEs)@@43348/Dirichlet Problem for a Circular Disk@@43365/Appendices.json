{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To begin our hands-on exploration, we will tackle a classic problem involving steady-state heat distribution. This exercise requires you to solve Laplace's equation on a unit disk where the boundary temperature is described by the function $u(1, \\theta) = \\sin^2(\\theta)$. The key step here is to represent this seemingly simple boundary condition as a Fourier series, which is a foundational skill for solving Dirichlet problems. By working through this, you'll gain practical experience with the separation of variables method and the importance of trigonometric identities in matching the general solution to specific physical constraints [@problem_id:2097779].", "problem": "A thin, circular disk of unit radius, representing a simplified model of an optical component, is placed in a test chamber. The flat top and bottom faces of the disk are perfectly insulated, so heat can only flow radially and angularly. The temperature along the boundary of the disk (at a radial distance $r=1$) is carefully maintained according to the function $u(1, \\theta) = \\sin^2(\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angular position in radians. The system is allowed to reach thermal equilibrium, meaning the temperature distribution no longer changes with time (i.e., it reaches a steady state).\n\nDetermine the steady-state temperature function $u(r, \\theta)$ for any point $(r, \\theta)$ inside the disk, where $0 \\le r  1$. Express your answer as an analytic function of $r$ and $\\theta$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the steady-state temperature distribution $u(r, \\theta)$ inside a unit circular disk. The governing partial differential equation for steady-state heat conduction in a region with no heat sources is the Laplace equation. In polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, the Laplace equation is:\n$$ \\nabla^2 u = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial \\theta^2} = 0 $$\nThe domain is the interior of the unit disk, $0 \\le r  1$ and $0 \\le \\theta  2\\pi$. The boundary condition is given at $r=1$:\n$$ u(1, \\theta) = \\sin^2(\\theta) $$\nWe also have an implicit physical condition that the temperature must remain finite at the center of the disk, i.e., $u(0, \\theta)$ must be finite.\n\nWe solve this equation using the method of separation of variables. Let's assume a solution of the form $u(r, \\theta) = R(r)\\Theta(\\theta)$. Substituting this into the Laplace equation gives:\n$$ R''(r)\\Theta(\\theta) + \\frac{1}{r}R'(r)\\Theta(\\theta) + \\frac{1}{r^2}R(r)\\Theta''(\\theta) = 0 $$\nWe can separate the variables by multiplying the entire equation by $\\frac{r^2}{R(r)\\Theta(\\theta)}$:\n$$ \\frac{r^2 R''(r) + r R'(r)}{R(r)} + \\frac{\\Theta''(\\theta)}{\\Theta(\\theta)} = 0 $$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$ \\frac{r^2 R''(r) + r R'(r)}{R(r)} = -\\frac{\\Theta''(\\theta)}{\\Theta(\\theta)} $$\nSince the left side depends only on $r$ and the right side depends only on $\\theta$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we'll call $\\lambda$. This gives us two ordinary differential equations:\n1.  $\\Theta''(\\theta) + \\lambda \\Theta(\\theta) = 0$\n2.  $r^2 R''(r) + r R'(r) - \\lambda R(r) = 0$\n\nFirst, we solve the equation for $\\Theta(\\theta)$. Since temperature must be a single-valued function of position, $\\Theta(\\theta)$ must be periodic with period $2\\pi$. That is, $\\Theta(\\theta) = \\Theta(\\theta+2\\pi)$.\n- If $\\lambda  0$, say $\\lambda = -k^2$, the general solution is $\\Theta(\\theta) = c_1 e^{k\\theta} + c_2 e^{-k\\theta}$. For this to be periodic, we must have $c_1=c_2=0$, which gives the trivial solution.\n- If $\\lambda = 0$, the general solution is $\\Theta(\\theta) = c_1 \\theta + c_2$. For periodicity, we need $c_1=0$. So, $\\Theta(\\theta) = c_2$ is a constant solution.\n- If $\\lambda  0$, say $\\lambda = n^2$ where $n  0$, the general solution is $\\Theta(\\theta) = c_1 \\cos(n\\theta) + c_2 \\sin(n\\theta)$. The periodicity condition requires that $n$ must be an integer, so $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are $\\lambda_n = n^2$ for $n=0, 1, 2, \\ldots$.\n\nNext, we solve the radial equation for $R(r)$ for these eigenvalues. The equation is a Cauchy-Euler equation:\n$$ r^2 R''(r) + r R'(r) - n^2 R(r) = 0 $$\nFor $n=0$, the equation is $r^2 R'' + r R' = 0$, which has the general solution $R_0(r) = A_0 + B_0 \\ln(r)$.\nFor $n  0$, we look for solutions of the form $R(r) = r^m$. Substituting this in gives $m(m-1) + m - n^2 = 0$, which simplifies to $m^2 - n^2 = 0$, so $m = \\pm n$. The general solution is $R_n(r) = A_n r^n + B_n r^{-n}$.\n\nThe physical constraint is that the temperature must be finite at the origin ($r=0$).\n- For the $n=0$ solution, the $\\ln(r)$ term diverges as $r \\to 0$, so we must set $B_0=0$. This leaves $R_0(r) = A_0$.\n- For the $n0$ solutions, the $r^{-n}$ term diverges as $r \\to 0$, so we must set all $B_n=0$. This leaves $R_n(r) = A_n r^n$.\n\nCombining the solutions for $R(r)$ and $\\Theta(\\theta)$ and summing over all possible values of $n$ (by the principle of superposition), we get the general solution for the temperature inside the disk:\n$$ u(r, \\theta) = A_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} r^n (A_n \\cos(n\\theta) + C_n \\sin(n\\theta)) $$\n(We rename the constants for clarity).\n\nNow, we apply the boundary condition at $r=1$:\n$$ u(1, \\theta) = \\sin^2(\\theta) = A_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} (A_n \\cos(n\\theta) + C_n \\sin(n\\theta)) $$\nThe right side is the Fourier series expansion of the function on the left side. To find the coefficients $A_n$ and $C_n$, we can either use the standard integral formulas for Fourier coefficients or, if possible, express the boundary function as a finite trigonometric series and compare coefficients directly.\n\nLet's use the power-reduction trigonometric identity for $\\sin^2(\\theta)$:\n$$ \\sin^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1 - \\cos(2\\theta)}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(2\\theta) $$\nNow we can compare this expression with the Fourier series form at $r=1$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(2\\theta) = A_0 + A_1 \\cos(\\theta) + A_2 \\cos(2\\theta) + \\ldots + C_1 \\sin(\\theta) + C_2 \\sin(2\\theta) + \\ldots $$\nBy matching the coefficients term-by-term, we find:\n- The constant term: $A_0 = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- The coefficient of $\\cos(2\\theta)$: $A_2 = -\\frac{1}{2}$\n- All other coefficients are zero: $A_n = 0$ for $n \\neq 0, 2$, and $C_n = 0$ for all $n \\ge 1$.\n\nFinally, we substitute these coefficients back into the general solution for $u(r, \\theta)$:\n$$ u(r, \\theta) = A_0 + r^2 (A_2 \\cos(2\\theta) + C_2 \\sin(2\\theta)) + \\ldots $$\n$$ u(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} + r^2 \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\cos(2\\theta) + 0 \\cdot \\sin(2\\theta)\\right) $$\n$$ u(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\cos(2\\theta) $$\nThis is the steady-state temperature distribution inside the disk.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} r^{2} \\cos(2\\theta)}$$", "id": "2097779"}, {"introduction": "Next, we increase the complexity by considering a boundary condition that is not a smooth, continuous function.
