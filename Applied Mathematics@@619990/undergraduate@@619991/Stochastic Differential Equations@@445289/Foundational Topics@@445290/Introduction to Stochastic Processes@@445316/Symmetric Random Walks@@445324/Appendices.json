It is scientifically and mathematically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The quantity to be calculated, $u(i)$, is a well-defined probability. The boundary conditions are implicitly defined by the problem setup, leading to a unique solution. For $i=0$, the walk has already hit $0$, so $\\tau_0=0$ and $\\tau_N>0$, meaning $\\mathbb{P}_0(\\tau_N<\\tau_0)=0$. For $i=N$, the walk has already hit $N$, so $\\tau_N=0$ and $\\tau_0>0$, meaning $\\mathbb{P}_N(\\tau_N<\\tau_0)=1$. The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, formal mathematical language, with no ambiguity or subjectivity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Expression for $u(i)$\n\nLet $u(i) = \\mathbb{P}_{i}(\\tau_{N} < \\tau_{0})$ be the probability that the random walk, starting from state $i$, hits state $N$ before hitting state $0$. We are interested in finding $u(i)$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N-1\\}$.\n\nThe boundary conditions are determined by the definition of the event.\nIf the walk starts at $i=0$, it has hit state $0$ at time $n=0$. Thus, $\\tau_{0}=0$. Since $N \\ge 2$, it cannot be at state $N$ at time $n=0$, so $\\tau_{N}>0$. The event $\\tau_{N} < \\tau_{0}$ is impossible. Therefore,\n$$u(0) = 0$$\nIf the walk starts at $i=N$, it has hit state $N$ at time $n=0$. Thus, $\\tau_{N}=0$. Since $i \\neq 0$, $\\tau_{0}>0$. The event $\\tau_{N} < \\tau_{0}$ is certain. Therefore,\n$$u(N) = 1$$\n\nFor any interior state $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N-1\\}$, we can condition on the outcome of the first step, $S_{1}$. The first step is either to $i+1$ with probability $p$ or to $i-1$ with probability $q$. Using the law of total probability (or the definition of conditional expectation):\n$$u(i) = \\mathbb{P}_{i}(S_1=i+1) \\mathbb{P}_{i}(\\tau_N < \\tau_0 | S_1=i+1) + \\mathbb{P}_{i}(S_1=i-1) \\mathbb{P}_{i}(\\tau_N < \\tau_0 | S_1=i-1)$$\nBy definition, $\\mathbb{P}_{i}(S_1=i+1) = \\mathbb{P}(X_1=1) = p$ and $\\mathbb{P}_{i}(S_1=i-1) = \\mathbb{P}(X_1=-1) = q$.\n\nThe random walk has the Markov property, which means the future evolution of the process from state $S_1$ is independent of the path taken to reach $S_1$. Therefore, the probability of reaching $N$ before $0$ starting from $S_1=j$ is the same as the probability of reaching $N$ before $0$ if the process started at $j$ initially.\n$$\\mathbb{P}_{i}(\\tau_N < \\tau_0 | S_1=i+1) = \\mathbb{P}_{i+1}(\\tau_N<\\tau_0) = u(i+1)$$\n$$\\mathbb{P}_{i}(\\tau_N < \\tau_0 | S_1=i-1) = \\mathbb{P}_{i-1}(\\tau_N<\\tau_0) = u(i-1)$$\nSubstituting these into the equation for $u(i)$ yields a linear second-order homogeneous difference equation:\n$$u(i) = p \\cdot u(i+1) + q \\cdot u(i-1) \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N-1\\}$$\n\nWe solve this equation subject to the boundary conditions $u(0)=0$ and $u(N)=1$.\nSince $p+q=1$, we can write $u(i) = (p+q)u(i)$. The equation becomes:\n$$p u(i) + q u(i) = p u(i+1) + q u(i-1)$$\nRearranging terms, we get:\n$$p(u(i+1) - u(i)) = q(u(i) - u(i-1))$$\nLet $\\Delta(i) = u(i) - u(i-1)$ be the difference. The relation is $\\Delta(i+1) = \\frac{q}{p} \\Delta(i)$. This shows that the differences form a geometric progression.\nThe general solution to the difference equation $u(i) = p u(i+1) + q u(i-1)$ can be found using its characteristic equation. Assuming a solution of the form $u(i) = r^i$, we substitute it into the rearranged equation $p u(i+1) - u(i) + q u(i-1) = 0$:\n$$p r^{i+1} - r^i + q r^{i-1} = 0$$\nDividing by $r^{i-1}$ (since $r=0$ is not a solution), we get the characteristic equation:\n$$p r^2 - r + q = 0$$\nThis quadratic equation can be factored as $(pr - q)(r - 1) = 0$.\nThe roots are $r_1=1$ and $r_2=\\frac{q}{p}$.\n\n**Case 1: Biased walk ($p \\neq q$)**\nSince $p \\neq q$, the roots $r_1=1$ and $r_2=\\frac{q}{p}$ are distinct. The general solution is a linear combination of the powers of the roots:\n$$u(i) = A \\cdot (r_1)^i + B \\cdot (r_2)^i = A + B \\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^i$$\nWe determine the constants $A$ and $B$ using the boundary conditions $u(0)=0$ and $u(N)=1$.\nFrom $u(0)=0$:\n$$A + B \\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^0 = A+B = 0 \\implies A = -B$$\nFrom $u(N)=1$:\n$$A + B \\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^N = 1$$\nSubstituting $A=-B$ into the second equation:\n$$-B + B \\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^N = 1 \\implies B\\left(\\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^N - 1\\right) = 1$$\n$$B = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^N - 1}$$\nAnd thus:\n$$A = -B = \\frac{-1}{\\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^N - 1} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^N}$$\nSubstituting $A$ and $B$ back into the general solution:\n$$u(i) = \\frac{1}{1 - \\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^N} - \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^N - 1} \\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^i = \\frac{1 - \\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^i}{1 - \\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^N}$$\nThis is the required expression for $u(i)$ when $p \\neq q$.\n\n**Case 2: Symmetric limit ($p \\to \\frac{1}{2}$)**\nWe are asked to find the limit of the expression for $u(i)$ as $p \\to \\frac{1}{2}$. As $p \\to \\frac{1}{2}$, we have $q = 1-p \\to \\frac{1}{2}$, and thus the ratio $\\frac{q}{p} \\to 1$.\nThe expression for $u(i)$ becomes an indeterminate form $\\frac{0}{0}$:\n$$\\lim_{p \\to 1/2} u(i) = \\lim_{\\frac{q}{p} \\to 1} \\frac{1 - \\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^i}{1 - \\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^N}$$\nLet $x = \\frac{q}{p}$. We evaluate the limit $\\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{1 - x^i}{1 - x^N}$ using L'Hôpital's Rule. We differentiate the numerator and the denominator with respect to $x$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}(1-x^i) = -i x^{i-1}$$\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}(1-x^N) = -N x^{N-1}$$\nThe limit is:\n$$\\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{-i x^{i-1}}{-N x^{N-1}} = \\frac{-i \\cdot 1^{i-1}}{-N \\cdot 1^{N-1}} = \\frac{-i}{-N} = \\frac{i}{N}$$\nSo, in the symmetric case, the probability is $u(i) = \\frac{i}{N}$.\n\nWe can verify this result by solving the difference equation directly for $p=q=\\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe characteristic equation $pr^2 - r + q = 0$ becomes $\\frac{1}{2}r^2 - r + \\frac{1}{2} = 0$, or $r^2 - 2r + 1 = 0$, which is $(r-1)^2=0$.\nThis equation has a repeated root $r_1=r_2=1$. In this case, the general solution to the difference equation is:\n$$u(i) = A \\cdot (1)^i + B \\cdot i \\cdot (1)^i = A + Bi$$\nUsing the boundary conditions $u(0)=0$ and $u(N)=1$:\nFrom $u(0)=0$:\n$$A + B \\cdot 0 = 0 \\implies A=0$$\nFrom $u(N)=1$:\n$$A + B \\cdot N = 1$$\nSubstituting $A=0$ gives $BN=1$, so $B=\\frac{1}{N}$.\nThe solution is therefore $u(i) = \\frac{1}{N} \\cdot i = \\frac{i}{N}$, which confirms the result obtained from the limit.\n\nThe two expressions requested are:\n1.

The solution will be derived using martingale theory and the optional stopping theorem (OST).\n\nFirst, let us formalize the process.

A rigorous application of the OST involves considering the bounded stopping times $\\tau_{k} = \\tau \\wedge k = \\min(\\tau, k)$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Applying the OST to $\\tau_k$ gives $E[M_{\\tau_k}] = E[M_0]$.

We will proceed with this understanding.\n\nOur derivation requires two distinct martingales.\n\nFirst, we determine the probability of absorption at each boundary. Let $p_{i} = \\mathbb{P}_{i}(S_{\\tau} = N)$ be the probability that the walk is absorbed at $N$, given it starts at $i$. Consequently, $\\mathbb{P}_{i}(S_{\\tau} = 0) = 1 - p_{i}$.

For any $n \\geq 1$:\n$$\nE[S_{n} | \\mathcal{F}_{n-1}] = E[S_{n-1} + X_{n} | \\mathcal{F}_{n-1}]\n$$\nSince $S_{n-1}$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$-measurable and $X_{n}$ is independent of $\\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$:\n$$\nE[S_{n} | \\mathcal{F}_{n-1}] = S_{n-1} + E[X_{n}]\n$$\nThe expectation of a single step is $E[X_{n}] = (1) \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(X_{n}=1) + (-1) \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(X_{n}=-1) = 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} - 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 0$.\nThus, $E[S_{n} | \\mathcal{F}_{n-1}] = S_{n-1}$, confirming that $(S_{n})_{n \\geq 0}$ is a martingale.\n\nThe increments of the martingale are bounded, $|S_{n} - S_{n-1}| = |X_{n}| = 1$. The stopping time $\\tau$ has a finite expectation. These are sufficient conditions for the OST to apply to the martingale $S_n$ and stopping time $\\tau$.
