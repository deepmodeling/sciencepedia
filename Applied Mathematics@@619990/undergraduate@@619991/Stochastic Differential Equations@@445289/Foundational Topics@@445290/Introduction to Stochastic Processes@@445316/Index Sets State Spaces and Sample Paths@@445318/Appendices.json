A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution addresses the three parts of the problem concerning the stochastic processes $X$ and $Y$.\n\n**1. Almost Sure Equality for a Fixed Time $t$**\n\nWe must show that for any fixed $t \\in [0,T]$, the random variables $X_t$ and $Y_t$ are equal almost surely, which means $\\mathbb{P}(X_t = Y_t) = 1$.\n\nLet's fix an arbitrary $t \\in [0,T]$. We consider the event $\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega \\mid X_t(\\omega) = Y_t(\\omega)\\}$.\nAccording to the definitions provided:\n-   $X_t(\\omega) = 0$ for all $\\omega \\in \\Omega$.\n-   $Y_t(\\omega) = \\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\omega=t\\}}$, which is $1$ if $\\omega = t$ and $0$ if $\\omega \\neq t$.\n\nThe equality $X_t(\\omega) = Y_t(\\omega)$ holds if and only if $0 = Y_t(\\omega)$.\nThis is true if and only if $\\omega \\neq t$.\nTherefore, the set of outcomes for which $X_t$ and $Y_t$ are equal is the set of all $\\omega \\in \\Omega$ such that $\\omega \\neq t$.\nThis set is $\\Omega \\setminus \\{t\\}$, which is $[0,T] \\setminus \\{t\\}$.\n\nWe now calculate the probability of this event using the given measure $\\mathbb{P}$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(X_t = Y_t) = \\mathbb{P}(\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega \\mid \\omega \\neq t\\}) = \\mathbb{P}([0,T] \\setminus \\{t\\})\n$$\nBy definition of $\\mathbb{P}$, this is $\\frac{1}{T}\\lambda([0,T] \\setminus \\{t\\})$.\nThe Lebesgue measure $\\lambda$ is additive. For a measurable subset $\\{t\\} \\subset [0,T]$, we have $\\lambda([0,T]) = \\lambda([0,T] \\setminus \\{t\\}) + \\lambda(\\{t\\})$.\nThe Lebesgue measure of the interval $[0,T]$ is $\\lambda([0,T]) = T-0 = T$.\nThe problem states that the Lebesgue measure of a singleton is $0$, so $\\lambda(\\{t\\}) = 0$.\nThus, $\\lambda([0,T] \\setminus \\{t\\}) = \\lambda([0,T]) - \\lambda(\\{t\\}) = T - 0 = T$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the probability calculation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(X_t = Y_t) = \\frac{1}{T} \\lambda([0,T] \\setminus \\{t\\}) = \\frac{1}{T} \\cdot T = 1\n$$\nSince this holds for any arbitrarily chosen $t \\in [0,T]$, we have shown that $X_t$ and $Y_t$ are equal almost surely for each fixed $t$.\n\n**2. Indistinguishability of the Processes $X$ and $Y$**\n\nTwo processes $X$ and $Y$ are said to be indistinguishable if their sample paths are equal with probability $1$. This is formally expressed as:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega \\mid X_t(\\omega) = Y_t(\\omega) \\text{ for all } t \\in [0,T]\\}\\right) = 1\n$$\nLet's analyze the event $A = \\{\\omega \\in \\Omega \\mid X_t(\\omega) = Y_t(\\omega) \\text{ for all } t \\in [0,T]\\}$.\nAn outcome $\\omega_0 \\in \\Omega$ belongs to this set $A$ if and only if the equality $X_t(\\omega_0) = Y_t(\\omega_0)$ holds for every single $t$ in the interval $[0,T]$.\n\nFor a fixed $\\omega_0 \\in \\Omega = [0,T]$, the condition is:\n$0 = \\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\omega_0=t\\}}$ for all $t \\in [0,T]$.\n\nHowever, consider the specific choice $t = \\omega_0$. Since $\\omega_0 \\in [0,T]$, this choice of $t$ is valid.\nFor $t = \\omega_0$, the indicator function is $\\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\omega_0=\\omega_0\\}} = 1$.\nThe condition $0 = \\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\omega_0=t\\}}$ for $t=\\omega_0$ becomes $0 = 1$, which is a contradiction.\nThis means that for any given $\\omega_0 \\in \\Omega$, there exists at least one value of $t$ (namely, $t=\\omega_0$) for which $X_t(\\omega_0) \\neq Y_t(\\omega_0)$.\nConsequently, there is no outcome $\\omega_0$ in $\\Omega$ for which the sample paths are identical across the entire index set $[0,T]$.\n\nThe set $A$ is therefore the empty set: $A = \\emptyset$.\nThe probability of this event is $\\mathbb{P}(A) = \\mathbb{P}(\\emptyset) = 0$.\nSince this probability is $0$, not $1$, the processes $X$ and $Y$ are not indistinguishable.\n\nAlternatively, the event for indistinguishability is the intersection of events over all $t \\in [0,T]$:\n$$\nA = \\bigcap_{t \\in [0,T]} \\{\\omega \\in \\Omega \\mid X_t(\\omega) = Y_t(\\omega)\\} = \\bigcap_{t \\in [0,T]} (\\Omega \\setminus \\{t\\})\n$$\nAn element $\\omega_0$ belongs to this intersection if and only if $\\omega_0 \\in \\Omega \\setminus \\{t\\}$ for all $t \\in [0,T]$. This means $\\omega_0 \\neq t$ for all $t \\in [0,T]$. But $\\omega_0$ itself is in $[0,T]$, so if we take $t = \\omega_0$, we get the contradiction $\\omega_0 \\neq \\omega_0$. Thus, no such $\\omega_0$ exists, and the intersection is empty.\n\n**3. Computation of the Probability**\n\nAs determined in the previous part, the event that the sample paths of $X$ and $Y$ are identical for all $t \\in [0,T]$ is the empty set.\nWe are asked to compute the value of $\\mathbb{P}\\big(X_t=Y_t\\text{ for all }t\\in[0,T]\\big)$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}\\big(X_t=Y_t\\text{ for all }t\\in[0,T]\\big) = \\mathbb{P}(\\emptyset)\n$$\nBy the axioms of probability measures, the measure of the empty set is $0$.\nTherefore, the value of the probability is $0$.\nThis problem serves as a canonical example demonstrating that a process being almost surely equal at every point in an uncountable index set does not imply that the processes are indistinguishable. The intersection of uncountably many events of probability $1$ is not guaranteed to be an event of probability $1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3059772"}, {"introduction": "While many processes in finance and physics are modeled with continuous sample paths, like Brownian motion, numerous systems exhibit sudden, instantaneous jumps.

The problem asks to identify which options correctly describe a process with this property and correctly explain the term.\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this definition.\n\n**Option A:**\nThe process is a homogeneous Poisson process $(X_t)_{t \\in [0,T]}$ with rate $\\lambda  0$ on the state space $\\mathbb{N}_0$, with the initial condition $X_0 = 0$.\nA sample path of a homogeneous Poisson process is a step function. It is constant between jump times and increases by an integer value (specifically, $+1$) at each jump time. The number of jumps in any finite time interval is finite almost surely.\n- **Right-continuity:** By convention, the value of the process at a jump time $t_j$ is the value after the jump, i.e., $X_{t_j} = X_{t_j-} + 1$. For any $s  t_j$ in a sufficiently small neighborhood of $t_j$, $X_s = X_{t_j}$. Thus, $\\lim_{s \\downarrow t_j} X_s = X_{t_j}$. At points $t$ where no jump occurs, the path is continuous, so it is also right-continuous. This holds for all $t \\in [0, T)$.\n- **Left-limits:** For any $t \\in (0, T]$, since there are almost surely a finite number of jumps in $[0, t)$, there exists some $\\epsilon  0$ such that the process is constant on the interval $(t-\\epsilon, t)$. Therefore, the left limit $\\lim_{s \\uparrow t} X_s$ exists and is finite.\nThe explanation provided is: \"a càdlàg path is right-continuous at every $t \\in [0, T)$, and for each $t \\in (0, T]$ the left limit $X_{t-} = \\lim_{s \\uparrow t} X_s$ exists (and is finite); Poisson paths are step functions with isolated jumps, hence they satisfy this property.\" This explanation correctly defines the càdlàg property and correctly asserts that Poisson paths satisfy it.\nTherefore, Option A successfully provides a càdlàg process and a correct explanation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B:**\nThe process is a standard Brownian motion $(X_t)_{t \\in [0,T]}$ on $\\mathbb{R}$ with $X_0=0$.\nA defining property of standard Brownian motion is that its sample paths are continuous almost surely. Any continuous function on $[0, T]$ is trivially right-continuous and has left limits (which are equal to the function value). Thus, the sample paths of Brownian motion are indeed càdlàg.\nHowever, the explanation states that \"`càdlàg` means left-continuous with right limits\". This is incorrect. The term `càdlàg` explicitly means **right**-continuous with **left** limits. The explanation reverses the properties.\nAlthough the process itself is càdlàg, the accompanying explanation of the term is fundamentally wrong. The problem requires both the process construction and the explanation to be correct.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C:**\nThe process is a deterministic function defined by $X_t=\\sin(1/(T-t))$ for $t \\in [0,T)$ and $X_T=0$.\nLet's analyze this single sample path.\n- **Right-continuity:** For any $t \\in [0, T)$, the function $s \\mapsto \\sin(1/(T-s))$ is continuous at $s=t$, so it is right-continuous on $[0, T)$.\n- **Left-limits:** We must check the existence of the left limit at $t=T$. We evaluate $\\lim_{s \\uparrow T} X_s = \\lim_{s \\uparrow T} \\sin(1/(T-s))$. Let $u=1/(T-s)$. As $s \\to T^-$, $T-s \\to 0^+$, so $u \\to +\\infty$. The limit becomes $\\lim_{u \\to +\\infty} \\sin(u)$, which does not exist due to the persistent oscillation of the sine function between $-1$ and $1$.\nSince the left limit at $t=T$ does not exist, the path is not càdlàg. The explanation provided correctly identifies this failure: \"this path is not càdlàg because the left limit at $t=T$ does not exist\". The question, however, asks to select options that \"correctly construct a process ... **with** right-continuous sample paths that have left limits\". This option describes a process that does **not** have this property. Therefore, it does not fulfill the primary condition specified in the problem statement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option D:**\nThe process is a compound Poisson process $X_t=\\sum_{k=1}^{N_t}J_k$, where $(N_t)_{t \\in [0,T]}$ is a homogeneous Poisson process and the $J_k$ are i.i.d. jump sizes.\nThe sample path of a compound Poisson process has the same structure as that of a simple Poisson process: it is a right-continuous step function. The jumps occur at the same times as the jumps of the underlying process $N_t$. The number of jumps in $[0, T]$ is almost surely finite.\n- **Right-continuity:** The reasoning is identical to that for the simple Poisson process in Option A. The process is right-continuous.\n- **Left-limits:** Similar to Option A, for any $t \\in (0, T]$, there are no jumps in some interval $(t-\\epsilon, t)$, so the left limit exists. The condition $\\mathbb{E}[|J_k|]  \\infty$ implies that the jump sizes $J_k$ are finite almost surely. Since there are a finite number of jumps in $[0, t)$, the sum $X_t$ is finite, and therefore the left limit $\\lim_{s \\uparrow t} X_s$ is also finite.\nThe explanation states that \"sample paths are piecewise constant with isolated jumps, hence right-continuous with left limits at every $t \\in (0,T]$\". This is correct. It also gives the meaning of càdlàg: \"'càdlàg' means right-continuous with finite left limits on $(0,T]$\". This is a correct (though slightly less formal) definition.\nTherefore, Option D successfully provides a càdlàg process and a correct explanation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option E:**\nThe process is a jump process with jump times at $t_n = T - 1/n$ for $n \\in \\{k \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid T - 1/n \\ge 0\\}$. The jump size is $+1$ at each $t_n$.\nThis sequence of jump times $\\{t_n\\}$ has an accumulation point at $t=T$, since $t_n \\to T$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n- **Right-continuity:** The argument for right-continuity at each $t \\in [0, T)$ holds, as the path is piecewise constant and by convention takes its post-jump value at a jump time.\n- **Left-limits:** Let's examine the left limit at $t=T$. As $s \\uparrow T$, the time $s$ will surpass an infinite number of jump times $t_n$. For any integer $M  0$, we can find an $N$ such that for all $n  N$, $t_n  T - 1/M$. As $s$ approaches $T$, the value of the process $X_s$ will be the sum of all jumps that occurred before time $s$. Since there are infinitely many jumps of size $+1$ in any interval of the form $(T-\\epsilon, T)$, the value of the process increases without bound. Thus, $\\lim_{s \\uparrow T} X_s = +\\infty$.\nThe left limit at $t=T$ is not finite. Therefore, the sample path is not càdlàg for a real-valued process. The explanation claims the path is \"right-continuous with left limits everywhere (hence càdlàg)\". This is false because the left limit at $T$ is not finite.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nIn summary, only options A and D correctly describe a càdlàg process and provide a correct explanation of the term.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "3059721"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the foundational definitions of sample paths, we now apply these ideas to the single most important stochastic process: Brownian motion.

Therefore, $\\sup_{t \\ge 0} W_t = \\infty$ almost surely.\n\nSince $W_0 = 0$ and the sample paths are almost surely continuous, if a path has a supremum of $\\infty$, the Intermediate Value Theorem implies that it must take on every positive value. For any given $a0$, there must exist some time $t$ for which $W_t = a$. The set of such times $\\{t \\ge 0 : W_t = a\\}$ is therefore non-empty almost surely. As the path is continuous, this set is also a closed set, and its infimum, $\\tau_a$, must be a member of the set. Thus, $\\tau_a$ is finite almost surely.

By the symmetry of the Gaussian distribution of increments, this process has the same law as its negative, $-(W_t - W_{\\tau_a})$. The process $\\tilde{W}_t$ for $t  \\tau_a$ is $a - (W_t - W_{\\tau_a})$, which has the same law as $a + (W_t - W_{\\tau_a}) = W_t$. Consequently, the entire reflected path $(\\tilde{W}_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ has the same distribution as the original Brownian motion $(W_t)_{t \\ge 0}$.\n\nThe reflection creates a bijective correspondence between paths in the set $\\{M_T \\ge a, W_T  a\\}$ and paths in the set $\\{M_T \\ge a, W_T  a\\}$. If a path satisfies $M_T \\ge a$ and $W_T  a$, then $\\tau_a \\le T$. Its reflection $\\tilde{W}_t$ has $\\tilde{W}_T = 2a - W_T$. Since $W_T  a$, we have $\\tilde{W}_T  a$. For this reflected path, the maximum up to time $T$ must also be at least $a$. Thus, the reflected path is in the set $\\{M_T \\ge a, W_T  a\\}$. Since the mapping preserves the measure, the probabilities of these two sets are equal:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(M_T \\ge a, W_T  a) = \\mathbb{P}(M_T \\ge a, W_T  a)\n$$\nAs established earlier, $\\mathbb{P}(M_T \\ge a, W_T  a) = \\mathbb{P}(W_T  a)$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(M_T \\ge a, W_T  a) = \\mathbb{P}(W_T  a)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the equation for $\\mathbb{P}(M_T \\ge a)$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(M_T \\ge a) = \\mathbb{P}(W_T  a) + \\mathbb{P(W_T  a)} = 2 \\mathbb{P}(W_T  a)\n$$\nSince the distribution of $W_T$ is continuous, $\\mathbb{P}(W_T  a) = \\mathbb{P}(W_T \\ge a)$. Thus, we have the result of the reflection principle:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le T) = \\mathbb{P}(M_T \\ge a) = 2 \\mathbb{P}(W_T \\ge a)\n$$\nNow we compute $\\mathbb{P}(W_T \\ge a)$. We are given that $W_T \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, T)$. To use the standard normal cumulative distribution function $\\Phi(x)$, we standardize the random variable $W_T$. Let $Z = W_T / \\sqrt{T}$. Then $Z$ follows the standard normal distribution, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(W_T \\ge a) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\frac{W_T}{\\sqrt{T}} \\ge \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{T}}\\right) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(Z \\ge \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{T}}\\right)\n$$\nThe probability $\\mathbb{P}(Z \\ge x)$ for a standard normal variable $Z$ is given by $1 - \\mathbb{P}(Z  x)$. Since $Z$ has a continuous distribution, this is $1 - \\mathbb{P}(Z \\le x) = 1 - \\Phi(x)$. Thus,\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}\\left(Z \\ge \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{T}}\\right) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{T}}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, substituting this into our expression for $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le T)$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le T) = 2 \\mathbb{P}(W_T \\ge a) = 2\\left(1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{T}}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the desired probability.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2\\left(1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{T}}\\right)\\right)}\n$$", "id": "3059723"}]}
