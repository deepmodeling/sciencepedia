No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is divided into two parts. We will address each part sequentially, starting from first principles as requested.\n\n### Part 1: Determination and analysis of the filtration $\\mathcal{F}_t^X$\n\nThe stochastic process is defined by $X_t(\\omega) = f(t)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ and $\\omega \\in \\Omega = [0,1]$. For any fixed time $t$, the function $X_t: \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a random variable. However, its value $f(t)$ is constant with respect to the outcome $\\omega$. Let us denote this constant value by $c_t = f(t)$. So, for each $t$, the random variable is $X_t(\\omega) = c_t$.\n\nFirst, we determine the $\\sigma$-algebra generated by a single such random variable, $\\sigma(X_s)$, for a fixed $s \\in [0,1]$. By definition, $\\sigma(X_s)$ is the smallest $\\sigma$-algebra on $\\Omega$ with respect to which $X_s$ is measurable. It is given by the collection of all pre-images of Borel sets in $\\mathbb{R}$:\n$$\n\\sigma(X_s) = \\{ X_s^{-1}(B) \\mid B \\in \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R}) \\}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})$ is the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra on $\\mathbb{R}$. Let's examine the pre-image $X_s^{-1}(B) = \\{ \\omega \\in \\Omega \\mid X_s(\\omega) \\in B \\}$. Since $X_s(\\omega) = c_s$, this set is:\n$$\nX_s^{-1}(B) = \\{ \\omega \\in \\Omega \\mid c_s \\in B \\}\n$$\nThere are two possibilities for any given Borel set $B$:\n1. If the constant $c_s$ is an element of $B$ (i.e., $c_s \\in B$), then the condition is true for all $\\omega \\in \\Omega$. Thus, $X_s^{-1}(B) = \\Omega$.\n2. If the constant $c_s$ is not an element of $B$ (i.e., $c_s \\notin B$), then the condition is false for all $\\omega \\in \\Omega$. Thus, $X_s^{-1}(B) = \\emptyset$.\n\nTherefore, the set of all possible pre-images is simply $\\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\}$. This collection is itself a $\\sigma$-algebra, known as the trivial $\\sigma$-algebra. So, for any $s \\in [0,1]$:\n$$\n\\sigma(X_s) = \\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\}\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the natural filtration of the process $X$, which is defined as $\\mathcal{F}_t^X = \\sigma(X_s : 0 \\leq s \\leq t)$. This is the smallest $\\sigma$-algebra on $\\Omega$ that makes all random variables $X_s$ for $s \\in [0,t]$ measurable. It is generated by the union of the individual $\\sigma$-algebras:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}_t^X = \\sigma\\left(\\bigcup_{s \\in [0,t]} \\sigma(X_s)\\right)\n$$\nSince we found that $\\sigma(X_s) = \\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\}$ for every $s$, the union is:\n$$\n\\bigcup_{s \\in [0,t]} \\sigma(X_s) = \\bigcup_{s \\in [0,t]} \\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\} = \\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\}\n$$\nThe smallest $\\sigma$-algebra containing $\\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\}$ is just $\\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\}$ itself. Therefore, for any $t \\in [0,1]$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}_t^X = \\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\}\n$$\nThis result shows that the filtration $\\mathcal{F}_t^X$ is the trivial $\\sigma$-algebra for all $t \\in [0,1]$. Consequently, it is constant in $t$. The intuitive reason for this is that the process $X_t(\\omega) = f(t)$ is deterministic; observing its path up to time $t$ provides no information about the random outcome $\\omega$, as the path is identical for all $\\omega$. The filtration, which represents the information accumulated over time, therefore remains minimal (trivial) and does not grow.\n\nThe problem asks to discuss how this conclusion depends on the choice of the ambient $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{F}$. The problem defines $\\mathcal{F}$ as the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra on $[0,1]$. The natural filtration $\\mathcal{F}_t^X$ is, by definition, the smallest filtration with respect to which the process $(X_s)_{s \\in [0,t]}$ is adapted. Its construction depends only on the process $X$ itself. The role of the ambient $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{F}$ is to be a space of events rich enough that each $X_t$ is a valid random variable (i.e., is $\\mathcal{F}$-measurable). As we showed, for any $t$, $X_t$ is a constant function on $\\Omega$. A constant function is measurable with respect to *any* $\\sigma$-algebra on $\\Omega$, including the smallest possible one, $\\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\}$, and the given large one, the Borel sets on $[0,1]$. Since the measurability of $X_t$ is guaranteed for any choice of ambient $\\sigma$-algebra on $\\Omega$, the subsequent construction of $\\mathcal{F}_t^X$ yields $\\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\}$ regardless of whether the ambient $\\sigma$-algebra is the minimal one that works, or a much larger one like the one specified in the problem. Thus, the conclusion that the natural filtration is trivial and constant is independent of the choice of the ambient $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{F}$.\n\n### Part 2: Computation of the conditional expectation\n\nWe are asked to compute the conditional expectation $Y = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{1}_A \\mid \\mathcal{F}_t^X]$, where $A = [0, \\frac{1}{3}]$.\nBy the definition of conditional expectation, $Y$ must satisfy two properties:\n1. $Y$ is a random variable that is measurable with respect to the conditioning $\\sigma$-algebra, $\\mathcal{F}_t^X$.\n2. For every set $B \\in \\mathcal{F}_t^X$, the following integral identity holds: $\\int_B Y d\\mathbb{P} = \\int_B \\mathbf{1}_A d\\mathbb{P}$.\n\nFrom Part 1, we know that $\\mathcal{F}_t^X = \\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\}$ for any $t \\in [0,1]$.\n\nLet's first analyze the measurability condition (1). A random variable $Y: \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is measurable with respect to the trivial $\\sigma$-algebra $\\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\}$ if and only if it is a constant function. To see this, let $Y$ be $\\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\}$-measurable. For any value $y$ in the range of $Y$, the set $Y^{-1}(\\{y\\})$ must be in $\\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\}$. If the range of $Y$ contained more than one value, say $y_1$ and $y_2$, then $Y^{-1}(\\{y_1\\})$ and $Y^{-1}(\\{y_2\\})$ would be non-empty, disjoint sets. But the only non-empty set in $\\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\}$ is $\\Omega$ itself, which is not disjoint from itself. Therefore, the range of $Y$ can contain at most one value, meaning $Y$ must be a constant. Let's denote this constant value by $c$. So, $Y(\\omega) = c$ for all $\\omega \\in \\Omega$.\n\nNow we apply the integral condition (2). We must check the identity for both sets in $\\mathcal{F}_t^X = \\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\}$.\n- For $B = \\emptyset$: $\\int_{\\emptyset} c \\, d\\mathbb{P} = 0$ and $\\int_{\\emptyset} \\mathbf{1}_A \\, d\\mathbb{P} = 0$. The identity $0=0$ holds trivially for any $c$.\n- For $B = \\Omega$: We require $\\int_{\\Omega} c \\, d\\mathbb{P} = \\int_{\\Omega} \\mathbf{1}_A \\, d\\mathbb{P}$.\n  - The left-hand side is $\\int_{\\Omega} c \\, d\\mathbb{P} = c \\int_{\\Omega} d\\mathbb{P} = c \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(\\Omega)$. Since $\\mathbb{P}$ is the Lebesgue probability measure on $\\Omega = [0,1]$, we have $\\mathbb{P}(\\Omega)=1$. So, the left-hand side is just $c$.\n  - The right-hand side is $\\int_{\\Omega} \\mathbf{1}_A \\, d\\mathbb{P} = \\mathbb{P}(A)$.\n\nEquating the two sides gives $c = \\mathbb{P}(A)$.\n\nThe set is $A = [0, \\frac{1}{3}]$. The probability measure $\\mathbb{P}$ is the Lebesgue measure on $[0,1]$. Therefore, the probability of $A$ is its length:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(A) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\left[0, \\frac{1}{3}\\right]\\right) = \\frac{1}{3} - 0 = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nThus, the constant $c$ must be $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe conditional expectation $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{1}_A \\mid \\mathcal{F}_t^X]$ is the constant random variable whose value is $\\frac{1}{3}$.

The $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{F}$ is defined as $\\mathcal{F}_{T}$, which is the augmented natural filtration generated by the Brownian motion up to time $T$. By the definition of the natural filtration, the random variable $W_{T}$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{T}$-measurable. Consequently, $W_{T}$ is $\\mathcal{F}$-measurable.\n\nThe function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x) = \\exp(\\lambda x)$ is a continuous function. Every continuous function is a Borel-measurable function. A fundamental property of measurable spaces states that a Borel-measurable function of a measurable random variable is also a measurable random variable. Since $W_{T}$ is $\\mathcal{F}$-measurable and $f(x)$ is Borel-measurable, the composite random variable $X_{t} = f(W_{T}) = \\exp(\\lambda W_{T})$ is $\\mathcal{F}$-measurable for every $t \\in [0,T]$.\n\nSecond, we show that for $t<T$, the process $(X_{t})_{t\\in[0,T]}$ is not adapted to the filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_{t})_{t\\in[0,T]}$.\nA stochastic process $(Y_s)_{s\\in[0,T]}$ is said to be adapted to a filtration $(\\mathcal{G}_s)_{s\\in[0,T]}$ if for every $s \\in [0,T]$, the random variable $Y_s$ is $\\mathcal{G}_s$-measurable. To show that $(X_t)$ is not adapted to $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$, we must show that there exists at least one $t \\in [0,T]$ for which $X_t$ is not $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable.\n\nLet us consider any $t \\in [0,T)$ such that $t < T$. For the process $(X_t)$ to be adapted, $X_t = \\exp(\\lambda W_T)$ would need to be $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable. The filtration $\\mathcal{F}_t$ represents the information available from observing the path of the Brownian motion up to time $t$.\n\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that $X_t$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable for some $t < T$. Since $\\lambda \\neq 0$, the function $g(y) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\ln(y)$, defined for $y>0$, is a Borel-measurable function. If $X_t = \\exp(\\lambda W_T)$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable, then $W_T = g(X_t)$ must also be $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable.\n\nWe can express $W_T$ as the sum of two terms: $W_T = W_t + (W_T - W_t)$.\nThe random variable $W_t$ is, by definition, $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable. If we assume $W_T$ is also $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable, then the difference $W_T - W_t$ must be $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable. This is because the set of $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable random variables forms a vector space.\n\nHowever, a fundamental property of standard Brownian motion is that it has independent increments. Specifically, for any $s < u$, the increment $W_u - W_s$ is independent of the filtration $\\mathcal{F}_s = \\sigma(W_v : 0\\leq v \\leq s)$. In our case, with $t<T$, the increment $W_T - W_t$ is independent of $\\mathcal{F}_t$.\n\nA random variable that is measurable with respect to a $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{G}$ cannot be independent of $\\mathcal{G}$, unless the random variable is almost surely constant. Let's check if $W_T - W_t$ is constant. The increment $W_T - W_t$ follows a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $T-t$. Since we chose $t<T$, the variance $T-t > 0$. A random variable with a positive variance is not almost surely constant.\n\nTherefore, $W_T - W_t$ is a non-constant random variable that is independent of $\\mathcal{F}_t$. This implies that $W_T - W_t$ cannot be $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable. This contradicts our deduction from the initial assumption. Thus, the initial assumption must be false: $W_T$ is not $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable, and consequently, $X_t = \\exp(\\lambda W_T)$ is not $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable for any $t < T$.\n\nSince there exists $t \\in [0,T]$ (in fact, for all $t \\in [0,T)$) for which $X_t$ is not $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable, the process $(X_{t})_{t\\in[0,T]}$ is not adapted to the filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_{t})_{t\\in[0,T]}$.\n\nPart 2: Computation of the Conditional Expectation\n\nWe are asked to compute $Y_t := \\mathbb{E}[X_{t}\\mid \\mathcal{F}_{t}]$ for $t\\in[0,T)$.\nSubstituting the definition of $X_t$, we have:\n$$ Y_t = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\lambda W_{T})\\mid \\mathcal{F}_{t}] $$\nWe use the decomposition $W_T = W_t + (W_T - W_t)$:\n$$ Y_t = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\lambda (W_{t} + W_{T}-W_{t}))\\mid \\mathcal{F}_{t}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\lambda W_{t})\\exp(\\lambda (W_{T}-W_{t}))\\mid \\mathcal{F}_{t}] $$\nNow, we use two key properties of conditional expectation.\n1. Taking out what is known: A random variable that is measurable with respect to the conditioning $\\sigma$-algebra can be factored out. Here, $W_t$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable, and so is any Borel function of it, such as $\\exp(\\lambda W_t)$. Therefore:\n$$ Y_t = \\exp(\\lambda W_{t}) \\, \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\lambda (W_{T}-W_{t}))\\mid \\mathcal{F}_{t}] $$\n2. Independence: If a random variable is independent of the conditioning $\\sigma$-algebra, its conditional expectation is equal to its unconditional expectation. As established in Part 1, the increment $W_T - W_t$ is independent of the filtration $\\mathcal{F}_t$. The random variable $\\exp(\\lambda(W_T - W_t))$ is thus also independent of $\\mathcal{F}_t$. This gives:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\lambda (W_{T}-W_{t}))\\mid \\mathcal{F}_{t}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\lambda (W_{T}-W_{t}))] $$\nCombining these results, we have:\n$$ Y_t = \\exp(\\lambda W_{t}) \\, \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\lambda (W_{T}-W_{t}))] $$\nThe problem now reduces to computing the unconditional expectation $\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\lambda(W_T - W_t))]$. Let the random variable be $Z := W_T - W_t$. Due to the stationary and independent increments property of standard Brownian motion, $Z$ has the same distribution as $W_{T-t}$. A standard Brownian motion $W_s$ at time $s$ is a centered normal random variable with variance $s$, i.e., $W_s \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,s)$. Therefore, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, T-t)$.\n\nThe expectation $\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\lambda Z)]$ is the moment-generating function (MGF) of the random variable $Z$, evaluated at $\\lambda$. The MGF of a normal random variable $V \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ is given by $M_V(k) = \\exp(k\\mu + \\frac{1}{2}k^2\\sigma^2)$.\nFor our centered normal random variable $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, T-t)$, we have mean $\\mu=0$ and variance $\\sigma^2 = T-t$. Evaluating its MGF at $k=\\lambda$, we get:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\lambda Z)] = \\exp\\left(\\lambda \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda^2(T-t)\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda^2(T-t)\\right) $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $Y_t$:\n$$ Y_t = \\exp(\\lambda W_{t}) \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda^2(T-t)\\right) $$\nCombining the exponents, we obtain the final closed-form expression for the conditional expectation for $t \\in [0,T)$:\n$$ Y_t = \\mathbb{E}[X_{t}\\mid \\mathcal{F}_{t}] = \\exp\\left(\\lambda W_{t} + \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda^2(T-t)\\right) $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\exp\\left(\\lambda W_{t} + \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda^{2}(T-t)\\right)}$$", "id": "2976607"}]}
