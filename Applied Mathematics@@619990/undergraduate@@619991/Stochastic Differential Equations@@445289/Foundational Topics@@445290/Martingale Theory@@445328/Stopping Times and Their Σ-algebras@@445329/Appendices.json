We will address each part in sequence, starting from fundamental definitions and properties as instructed.\n\nLet $B=(B_t)_{t\\ge 0}$ be a standard Brownian motion on a filtered probability space $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\ge 0},\\mathbb{P})$ with $B_0=0$. The filtration is the natural filtration of $B$ satisfying the usual conditions. For a fixed $a\\in\\mathbb{R}$, the first hitting time is $\\tau_a=\\inf\\{t\\ge 0:\\,B_t=a\\}$.\n\n1. We first justify that $\\tau_a$ is a stopping time with respect to $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\ge 0}$. By definition, a random time $\\tau$ is a stopping time if for every $t \\ge 0$, the event $\\{\\tau \\le t\\}$ is in the $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_t$.\n- If $a=0$, then since $B_0=0$, the infimum is achieved at $t=0$, so $\\tau_0=0$. For any $t\\ge 0$, the event $\\{\\tau_0 \\le t\\}$ is $\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega: 0 \\le t\\}$, which is the entire sample space $\\Omega$. Since $\\mathcal{F}_t$ is a $\\sigma$-algebra on $\\Omega$, $\\Omega \\in \\mathcal{F}_t$. Thus, $\\tau_0$ is a stopping time.\n- If $a \\ne 0$, we rely on the continuity of the sample paths of Brownian motion, which is a fundamental property. Consider the case $a>0$. The event $\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}$ occurs if the process $B$ reaches the level $a$ at some time $s$ in the interval $[0, t]$. Due to path continuity, this is equivalent to the supremum of the process over $[0, t]$ being greater than or equal to $a$.\n$$ \\{\\tau_a \\le t\\} = \\left\\{ \\omega \\in \\Omega : \\sup_{s \\in [0, t]} B_s(\\omega) \\ge a \\right\\} $$\nTo show this event belongs to $\\mathcal{F}_t$, we must show that the random variable $M_t = \\sup_{s \\in [0, t]} B_s$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable. Because the paths are continuous, the supremum over the interval $[0, t]$ is equal to the supremum over the countable dense subset of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0, t]$.\n$$ M_t = \\sup_{s \\in [0, t] \\cap \\mathbb{Q}} B_s $$\nFor any $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the event $\\{M_t \\le c\\}$ can be written as:\n$$ \\{M_t \\le c\\} = \\bigcap_{s \\in [0, t] \\cap \\mathbb{Q}} \\{B_s \\le c\\} $$\nFor each rational time $s \\in [0, t]$, the random variable $B_s$ is $\\mathcal{F}_s$-measurable by definition of the natural filtration. As $s \\le t$, the filtration property $\\mathcal{F}_s \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}_t$ implies that $B_s$ is also $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable. Consequently, the event $\\{B_s \\le c\\}$ is in $\\mathcal{F}_t$. Since $\\mathcal{F}_t$ is a $\\sigma$-algebra, it is closed under countable intersections. Therefore, $\\{M_t \\le c\\} \\in \\mathcal{F}_t$. This confirms that $M_t$ is an $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable random variable.\nAs a result, the event $\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\} = \\{M_t \\ge a\\}$ is also in $\\mathcal{F}_t$.\n- For the case $a<0$, an analogous argument holds using the infimum of the process, $m_t = \\inf_{s \\in [0, t]} B_s$. We have $\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\} = \\{m_t \\le a\\}$, and the $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurability of $m_t$ is proven similarly.\nThus, for any $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $\\tau_a$ is a stopping time.\n\n2. Next, we explain why $T = t \\wedge \\tau_a$ is a bounded stopping time and why $B_T = B_{t \\wedge \\tau_a}$ is integrable.\n- A deterministic time $t$ can be viewed as a constant stopping time. From part 1, $\\tau_a$ is a stopping time. A standard result is that if $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$ are stopping times, then their minimum $\\sigma_1 \\wedge \\sigma_2$ is also a stopping time. Therefore, $T = t \\wedge \\tau_a$ is a stopping time.\n- The stopping time $T$ is bounded because, for any outcome $\\omega \\in \\Omega$, $T(\\omega) = \\min(t, \\tau_a(\\omega))$. By definition of the minimum, $T(\\omega) \\le t$. Since $t$ is a fixed positive constant, $T$ is bounded by $t$.\n- To show that $B_T$ is integrable, we must demonstrate that $\\mathbb{E}[|B_T|] < \\infty$. The random variable $B_T$ can be expressed as:\n$$ B_{t \\wedge \\tau_a} = B_t \\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\tau_a > t\\}} + B_{\\tau_a} \\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}} $$\nOn the event $\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}$, we have $B_{\\tau_a} = a$ by definition of $\\tau_a$. So,\n$$ B_{t \\wedge \\tau_a} = B_t \\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\tau_a > t\\}} + a \\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}} $$\nUsing the triangle inequality for the absolute value, we get:\n$$ |B_{t \\wedge \\tau_a}| \\le |B_t \\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\tau_a > t\\}}| + |a \\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}}| = |B_t|\\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\tau_a > t\\}} + |a|\\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}} $$\nSince the indicator functions are non-negative and partition the sample space, we can establish an upper bound:\n$$ |B_{t \\wedge \\tau_a}| \\le |B_t| + |a| $$\nTaking the expectation of both sides and using its linearity:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[|B_{t \\wedge \\tau_a}|] \\le \\mathbb{E}[|B_t| + |a|] = \\mathbb{E}[|B_t|] + |a| $$\nFor a standard Brownian motion, $B_t$ is a normally distributed random variable with mean $0$ and variance $t$, i.e., $B_t \\sim N(0, t)$. The expected absolute value of $B_t$ is finite and given by $\\mathbb{E}[|B_t|] = \\sqrt{t} \\sqrt{2/\\pi} = \\sqrt{2t/\\pi}$.\nTherefore, $\\mathbb{E}[|B_{t \\wedge \\tau_a}|] \\le \\sqrt{2t/\\pi} + |a|$. Since both $t$ and $a$ are finite, this expectation is finite, which proves that $B_{t \\wedge \\tau_a}$ is an integrable random variable.\n\n3. Finally, we compute the expectation $\\mathbb{E}[B_{t \\wedge \\tau_a}]$ by applying the optional stopping theorem for bounded stopping times. The theorem states that if $(X_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ is a martingale and $T$ is a bounded stopping time, then $\\mathbb{E}[X_T] = \\mathbb{E}[X_0]$.\nWe verify that the conditions of this theorem are satisfied:\n- **Martingale:** The process is $(B_t)_{t\\ge 0}$. It is a fundamental property of standard Brownian motion that it is a martingale with respect to its natural filtration.\n- **Bounded Stopping Time:** The time is $T = t \\wedge \\tau_a$. As established in part 2, this is a stopping time that is bounded by the constant $t$.\nWith all conditions verified, we can apply the theorem to the martingale $B_t$ and the bounded stopping time $T = t \\wedge \\tau_a$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[B_{t \\wedge \\tau_a}] = \\mathbb{E}[B_0] $$\nThe problem states that the Brownian motion starts at zero, $B_0=0$.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[B_{t \\wedge \\tau_a}] = \\mathbb{E}[0] = 0 $$\nThus, the expectation of the stopped process is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3078707"}, {"introduction": "Beyond preserving expectations, the true power of stopping times lies in the Strong Markov Property, which states that a Markov process probabilistically restarts at these special times.

We are to derive this from first principles, relying on the strong Markov property.\n\nLet $\\{B_{t}\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ be a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion starting at $B_0 = 0$, defined on a probability space $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},\\mathbb{P})$. Let $\\{\\mathcal{F}_{t}\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ be the natural filtration generated by $\\{B_{t}\\}_{t \\ge 0}$. For a fixed constant $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the first hitting time is defined as $\\tau_{a} = \\inf\\{t \\ge 0 : B_{t} = a\\}$. It is a standard result that $\\tau_{a}$ is an $\\{\\mathcal{F}_{t}\\}_{t \\ge 0}$-stopping time. It is also a fundamental property of one-dimensional Brownian motion that it is recurrent, which implies that $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_{a} < \\infty) = 1$ for any $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The paths of a Brownian motion are continuous almost surely. Therefore, on the event $\\{\\tau_{a} < \\infty\\}$, which occurs with probability $1$, we have $B_{\\tau_{a}} = a$.\n\nThe random variable in question is $X_{t} = B_{\\tau_{a}+t} - a$. Using the fact that $B_{\\tau_{a}} = a$ almost surely, we can rewrite $X_{t}$ as:\n$$X_{t} = B_{\\tau_{a}+t} - B_{\\tau_{a}}$$\nThis expression represents the increment of the Brownian motion over a time interval of length $t$, starting from the random time $\\tau_{a}$.\n\nTo analyze the distribution of $X_{t}$, we invoke the strong Markov property of Brownian motion. The strong Markov property states that, conditional on the history of the process up to a stopping time $\\tau$, the future evolution of the process behaves like a new Brownian motion starting from the state at time $\\tau$, and is independent of the past. More formally, let us define a new process $\\{W_{s}\\}_{s \\ge 0}$ by setting $W_{s} = B_{\\tau_{a}+s} - B_{\\tau_{a}}$. The strong Markov property implies that the process $\\{W_{s}\\}_{s \\ge 0}$ is a standard Brownian motion, starting at $W_{0} = 0$, and is independent of the pre-$\\tau_a$ sigma-algebra, $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{a}}$.\n\nOur random variable is $X_{t} = W_{t}$. We first wish to find the conditional law of $X_{t}$ given $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{a}}$. The independence of the process $\\{W_{s}\\}_{s \\ge 0}$ from $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{a}}$ means that for any bounded, measurable function $g: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, we have:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[g(W_{t}) | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{a}}] = \\mathbb{E}[g(W_{t})]$$\nThe right-hand side is the unconditional expectation of $g(W_{t})$. Since $\\{W_{s}\\}_{s \\ge 0}$ is a standard Brownian motion, the random variable $W_{t}$ has a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $t$, which we denote by $\\mathcal{N}(0, t)$.\n\nTo find the conditional law, we can consider the conditional cumulative distribution function (CDF). For any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(X_{t} \\le x | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{a}}) = \\mathbb{P}(W_{t} \\le x | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{a}})$$\nBy the independence property derived from the strong Markov property, this conditional probability is equal to the unconditional probability:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(W_{t} \\le x | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{a}}) = \\mathbb{P}(W_{t} \\le x)$$\nSince $W_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,t)$, we have:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(W_{t} \\le x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^2}{2t}\\right) dy$$\nThis expression is a deterministic function of $x$ and $t$; it does not depend on any random outcomes in $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{a}}$. Therefore, the conditional law of $X_{t}$ given $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{a}}$ is the normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, t)$. This means that regardless of how and when the process hits the level $a$, the subsequent displacement $B_{\\tau_a+t} - a$ after a fixed time $t$ always follows the same $\\mathcal{N}(0, t)$ distribution. We can express this by saying $X_t$, conditioned on $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a}$, has the same law as $\\tilde{B}_t$, where $\\{\\tilde{B}_s\\}_{s \\ge 0}$ is a standard Brownian motion started at $0$ at time $0$.\n\nNext, we determine the unconditional distribution of $X_{t}$. The unconditional probability $\\mathbb{P}(X_{t} \\le x)$ can be found using the law of total expectation:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(X_{t} \\le x) = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{P}(X_{t} \\le x | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{a}})]$$\nAs we have just established, the conditional probability $\\mathbb{P}(X_{t} \\le x | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{a}})$ is a constant value, equal to $\\mathbb{P}(W_t \\le x)$, which is the CDF of an $\\mathcal{N}(0, t)$ distribution. The expectation of a constant is the constant itself. Therefore:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(X_{t} \\le x) = \\mathbb{P}(W_{t} \\le x)$$\nThis shows that the unconditional distribution of $X_{t}$ is also the normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, t)$.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the probability density function (PDF) of $X_{t}$. For a random variable following a normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$, the PDF is given by $f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$. For $X_{t} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t)$, we have $\\mu=0$ and $\\sigma^2=t$. Substituting these values, we obtain the PDF of $X_{t}$, denoted $f_{X_t}(x)$:\n$$f_{X_t}(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2t}\\right)$$\nThis is the required probability density function.

Since $\\tau_n$ is a stopping time, we can apply the Optional Stopping Theorem. The waiting time $T_1$ for a Poisson process is an exponential random variable with finite mean $1/\\lambda$.

The jump of the martingale is therefore entirely due to the jump of the Poisson process:\n$$ \\Delta M_\\sigma = \\Delta N_\\sigma - \\Delta(\\lambda t)_\\sigma = \\Delta N_\\sigma $$\nThe condition becomes $\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta N_\\sigma | \\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma-}] = 0$. The jumps of a standard Poisson process are non-negative integers ($\\Delta N_t \\in \\{0, 1, 2, ...\\}$). The conditional expectation of a non-negative random variable can be zero only if the random variable itself is zero almost surely. This means $\\Delta N_\\sigma = 0$ a.s.\n\nThis is a crucial result: a Poisson process almost surely does not jump at any predictable time.\nThe time $T_1$ is, by its very definition, a jump time. Specifically, the jump at $T_1$ is $\\Delta N_{T_1} = N_{T_1} - N_{T_1-} = 1 - 0 = 1$.\nSince $\\Delta N_{T_1} = 1 \\ne 0$, the time $T_1$ cannot be equal to any predictable time $\\sigma$ (on a set of positive probability).
