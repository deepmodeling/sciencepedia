In the numerical simulation of a stochastic differential equation (SDE), such as $dX_t = \\mu(X_t,t)\\,dt + \\sigma(X_t,t)\\,dB_t$, one needs to approximate increments $\\Delta B$ over small time steps $\\Delta t$.

It contains no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors.\n\nThe solution consists of two parts as requested: a theoretical derivation and an empirical verification.\n\n### Part 1: Theoretical Derivation\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the fundamental properties of expectation and variance for linear transformations of random variables. Let $Z$ be a random variable with mean $\\mathbb{E}[Z]$ and variance $\\mathrm{Var}(Z)$. For constants $a$ and $b$, the transformed variable $Y = aZ + b$ has mean $\\mathbb{E}[Y] = a\\mathbb{E}[Z] + b$ and variance $\\mathrm{Var}(Y) = a^2\\mathrm{Var}(Z)$. A critical property of the normal distribution is its closure under affine transformations: if $Z$ is normally distributed, so is $Y$.\n\nWe are given a standard normal random variable $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$, for which its expectation is $\\mathbb{E}[Z] = 0$ and its variance is $\\mathrm{Var}(Z) = 1$. The Brownian increment $\\Delta B$ is constructed as the random variable $\\Delta B = \\sqrt{\\Delta t}\\,Z$. This is a linear transformation with a scaling factor $a = \\sqrt{\\Delta t}$ and a shift $b = 0$.\n\nFirst, we compute the expectation of $\\Delta B$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta B] = \\mathbb{E}[\\sqrt{\\Delta t}\\,Z] = \\sqrt{\\Delta t}\\,\\mathbb{E}[Z]\n$$\nSubstituting the known value $\\mathbb{E}[Z] = 0$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta B] = \\sqrt{\\Delta t} \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\nThis establishes that the mean of the increment is $0$.\n\nSecond, we compute the variance of $\\Delta B$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta B) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\sqrt{\\Delta t}\\,Z) = (\\sqrt{\\Delta t})^2\\,\\mathrm{Var}(Z)\n$$\nSubstituting the known value $\\mathrm{Var}(Z) = 1$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta B) = \\Delta t \\cdot 1 = \\Delta t\n$$\nThis establishes that the variance of the increment is $\\Delta t$.\n\nGiven that $Z$ is a normally distributed random variable, the linearly transformed variable $\\Delta B$ must also be normally distributed. Combining these findings—a normal distribution with a mean of $0$ and a variance of $\\Delta t$—we conclude that $\\Delta B$ follows the distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\Delta t)$. This completes the derivation from first principles, confirming the scaling property used to simulate Wiener process increments.\n\n### Part 2: Empirical Verification\n\nFor the empirical verification, a numerical simulation is implemented according to the problem specification. The core of the implementation processes a suite of test cases, each defined by a pair of parameters $(\\Delta t, N)$, representing the time step size and the number of samples, respectively.\n\nThe procedure for each test case is as follows:\n$1$. A reproducible random number generator is used to generate $N$ independent samples, $\\{Z_i\\}_{i=1}^N$, from the standard normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.\n$2$. These standard samples are scaled to produce increments of a Wiener process, $\\{\\Delta B_i\\}_{i=1}^N$, using the theoretically-derived relationship $\\Delta B_i = \\sqrt{\\Delta t}\\,Z_i$.\n$3$. The sample mean, $\\hat{m}$, and the unbiased sample variance, $\\hat{s}^2$, of the generated increments are computed using the standard estimators:\n$$ \\hat{m} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\Delta B_i $$\n$$ \\hat{s}^2 = \\frac{1}{N-1}\\sum_{i=1}^N (\\Delta B_i - \\hat{m})^2 $$\n$4$. These empirical statistics are then compared against their theoretical expected values, which are $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{m}] = 0$ for the mean and $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{s}^2] = \\Delta t$ for the variance.\n$5$. The acceptance criterion quantifies whether the empirical estimates are statistically consistent with the theoretical targets. A test case is considered a pass if the estimates lie within a specified number of standard errors of their expected values. The problem specifies a multiplier of $c=3$.\n$6$. The first condition checks the sample mean. The theoretical variance of the sample mean is $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{m}) = \\frac{\\Delta t}{N}$. The condition is:\n$$ |\\hat{m} - 0| \\leq c \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Delta t}{N}} $$\n$7$. The second condition checks the sample variance. For samples from a normal distribution, the variance of the unbiased sample variance estimator is $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{s}^2) = \\frac{2\\Delta t^2}{N-1}$. The condition is:\n$$ |\\hat{s}^2 - \\Delta t| \\leq c \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\Delta t^2}{N-1}} $$\n$8$. A test case is marked as `True` if both conditions are met, and `False` otherwise. For the boundary case where $\\Delta t = 0$, the increments $\\Delta B_i$ are all identically $0$, leading to $\\hat{m}=0$ and $\\hat{s}^2=0$. The acceptance thresholds also evaluate to $0$, so both conditions $|0| \\leq 0$ are satisfied, and the case passes. The implementation correctly handles this limiting case without special conditional logic, as the numerical computations correctly yield the zero values throughout.\n\nThe final output is a list of boolean values, one for each test case, indicating the outcome of the verification.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates Brownian motion increments and verifies their statistical properties.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # (delta_t, N_samples)\n        (0.0, 1000),\n        (0.1, 5000),\n        (1.0, 100000),\n        (1e-4, 200000),\n        (2.5, 50000),\n    ]\n\n    # Acceptance criterion multiplier\n    c = 3.0\n\n    # Initialize a reproducible random number generator for consistent results.\n    # The seed value is arbitrary but fixed.\n    rng = np.random.default_rng(42)\n\n    results = []\n    for dt, N in test_cases:\n        # The case N <= 1 is not in the test suite.

All numerical values should be treated as pure numbers.", "solution": "The problem requires the implementation of a statistical validation pipeline for simulated increments of a one-dimensional Brownian motion. The validation is based on two fundamental properties of the standardized increments: normality and independence. The solution involves developing a programmatic test and applying it to four distinct test cases designed to probe the validator's effectiveness.\n\nThe validation pipeline proceeds in a sequence of steps for a given series of increments $\\{\\Delta W_k\\}_{k=1}^n$ corresponding to a time step $\\Delta t$.\n\n**Step 1: Standardization of Increments**\n\nThe theoretical foundation of Brownian motion states that for an equidistant time grid with step size $\\Delta t > 0$, the increments $\\Delta W_k$ are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) according to a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $\\Delta t$, denoted $\\Delta W_k \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\Delta t)$.\n\nTo facilitate a standard statistical test, we first transform the increments into a standard normal scale. The standardized increment, $Z_k$, is defined as:\n$$\nZ_k = \\frac{\\Delta W_k}{\\sqrt{\\Delta t}}\n$$\nUnder the null hypothesis that the original increments are from a true Brownian motion, the standardized increments $\\{Z_k\\}$ must be i.i.d. samples from a standard normal distribution, $Z_k \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. This standardized series $\\{Z_k\\}_{k=1}^n$ is the subject of the subsequent statistical tests.\n\n**Step 2: Normality Test**\n\nThe first property to validate is that the standardized increments follow a standard normal distribution. We employ the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test for this purpose. The KS test compares the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of the sample data $\\{Z_k\\}$ to the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the hypothesized distribution, which in this case is $\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$.\n\nThe null hypothesis ($H_0$) is that the data are drawn from the standard normal distribution. The test yields a $p$-value, $p_{\\text{KS}}$. A small $p$-value suggests that the sample distribution is significantly different from the theoretical distribution. We compare this $p$-value against a pre-defined significance level, $\\alpha_{\\text{norm}}$. The test is declared \"passed\" if the evidence against the null hypothesis is not statistically significant, i.e., if:\n$$\np_{\\text{KS}} \\ge \\alpha_{\\text{norm}}\n$$\nFor this problem, $\\alpha_{\\text{norm}} = 0.01$.\n\n**Step 3: Independence Test**\n\nThe second property to validate is the independence of the standardized increments. This is assessed by examining the sample autocorrelation function (ACF) at various time lags. If the series $\\{Z_k\\}$ is truly independent, its autocorrelation should be statistically indistinguishable from zero for all non-zero lags.\n\nFor a given lag $\\ell > 0$, the sample autocorrelation $r_{\\ell}$ is calculated using the formula:\n$$\nr_{\\ell} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{n-\\ell} (Z_k - \\bar{Z})(Z_{k+\\ell} - \\bar{Z})}{\\sum_{k=1}^{n} (Z_k - \\bar{Z})^2}\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the sample size and $\\bar{Z}$ is the sample mean of $\\{Z_k\\}$.\n\nUnder the null hypothesis of independence and for a large sample size $n$, the sample autocorrelation $r_{\\ell}$ is approximately normally distributed with mean $0$ and variance $1/n$. Consequently, the test statistic $\\sqrt{n}\\, r_{\\ell}$ is approximately standard normal:\n$$\n\\sqrt{n}\\, r_{\\ell} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)\n$$\nFrom this, we can calculate a two-sided $p$-value, $p_{\\ell}$, which represents the probability of observing an autocorrelation as extreme as $r_{\\ell}$ if the series were truly independent. $p_{\\ell} = 2 \\cdot (1 - \\Phi(|\\sqrt{n}\\, r_{\\ell}|))$, where $\\Phi$ is the standard normal CDF.\n\nSince we are testing for independence at multiple lags, specifically $\\mathcal{L} = \\{1, 2, 5\\}$, we perform three separate hypothesis tests. To control the family-wise error rate (the probability of making at least one Type I error) at a level $\\alpha_{\\text{indep}}$, we use the Bonferroni correction. The significance level for each individual test is adjusted to $\\alpha_{\\text{indep}}/m$, where $m = |\\mathcal{L}| = 3$. The independence test is declared \"passed\" only if the condition $p_{\\ell} \\ge \\alpha_{\\text{indep}}/m$ holds for all lags $\\ell \\in \\mathcal{L}$. For this problem, $\\alpha_{\\text{indep}} = 0.01$, so the corrected threshold is $0.01/3$.\n\n**Step 4: Overall Validation and Test Case Implementation**\n\nThe overall validation for a given series of increments passes if and only if both the normality test and the independence test pass.\n\nThe implementation will proceed by generating four sets of increments according to the problem specification, using a seeded pseudorandom number generator for reproducibility.\n\n- **Case 1 (Ideal):** Increments are generated as $\\Delta W_k = \\sqrt{\\Delta t}\\, \\xi_k$ with $\\xi_k \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ i.i.d. Here, $Z_k = \\xi_k$, so both normality and independence are satisfied by construction. This case is expected to pass.\n\n- **Case 2 (Non-normal):** Increments are generated using scaled Student's $t$-distributed variates. A standard Student's $t$ variable $S_k$ with $\\nu=3$ degrees of freedom is scaled to have unit variance, $T_k = S_k / \\sqrt{\\nu/(\\nu-2)}$, before being used to define $\\Delta W_k = \\sqrt{\\Delta t}\\, T_k$. The resulting $Z_k = T_k$ are independent but not normally distributed. This case is expected to fail the normality test.\n\n- **Case 3 (Dependent):** Increments are generated from a standard normal autoregressive process of order $1$ (AR($1$)), $Y_k = \\rho Y_{k-1} + \\sqrt{1-\\rho^2}\\, \\xi_k$, with $\\rho=0.3$. The marginal distribution of each $Y_k$ is $\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, but the terms are serially correlated. By setting $\\Delta W_k = \\sqrt{\\Delta t}\\, Y_k$, we get $Z_k = Y_k$. This series should pass the normality test but fail the independence test, particularly at lag $\\ell=1$.\n\n- **Case 4 (Boundary Sample Size):** This case uses the ideal generator but with a smaller sample size ($n=400$). The statistical tests have less power, but given the parameters, it is still expected to pass, testing the procedure's robustness with smaller datasets.\n\nThe final output is a list of four booleans, each indicating the overall pass/fail status for the corresponding test case.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import stats\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements a statistical validation pipeline for Brownian motion simulators\n    and applies it to four test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Global test parameters\n    LAGS = [1, 2, 5]\n    ALPHA_NORM = 0.01\n    ALPHA_INDEP = 0.01\n\n    def calculate_autocorrelation(z_series, lag):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the sample autocorrelation for a given lag.\n        \"\"\"\n        n = len(z_series)\n        z_demeaned = z_series - np.mean(z_series)\n        \n        # Numerator: sum_{k=1}^{n-l} (Z_k - Z_bar)(Z_{k+l} - Z_bar)\n        # Python indices: z_demeaned[:n-lag] and z_demeaned[lag:]\n        numerator = np.sum(z_demeaned[:n-lag] * z_demeaned[lag:])\n        \n        # Denominator: sum_{k=1}^{n} (Z_k - Z_bar)^2\n        denominator = np.sum(z_demeaned**2)\n        \n        if denominator == 0:\n            return 0.0\n            \n        return numerator / denominator\n\n    def validate_increments(delta_W, delta_t):\n        \"\"\"\n        Runs the full validation pipeline for a given set of increments.\n        \n        Args:\n            delta_W (np.ndarray): The simulated increments.\n            delta_t (float): The time step.\n\n        Returns:\n            bool: True if both normality and independence tests pass, False otherwise.\n        \"\"\"\n        n = len(delta_W)\n        \n        # Step 1: Standardization\n        if delta_t == 0: # Handle edge case\n            if np.all(delta_W == 0):\n                return True # All increments are zero, trivially normal and independent\n            else:\n                return False\n        \n        Z = delta_W / np.sqrt(delta_t)\n        \n        # Step 2: Normality Test (Kolmogorov-Smirnov)\n        _ks_stat, ks_p_value = stats.kstest(Z, 'norm')\n        normality_pass = (ks_p_value >= ALPHA_NORM)\n        \n        # Step 3: Independence Test (Autocorrelation)\n        independence_pass = True\n        m = len(LAGS)\n        alpha_bonferroni = ALPHA_INDEP / m\n        \n        for lag in LAGS:\n            if lag >= n:\n                continue  # Lag is too large for the series\n            \n            r_lag = calculate_autocorrelation(Z, lag)\n            \n            # Test statistic: sqrt(n) * r_lag ~ N(0,1) under H0\n            test_stat = np.sqrt(n) * r_lag\n            \n            # Two-sided p-value from standard normal distribution\n            p_value_lag = 2 * (1 - stats.norm.cdf(np.abs(test_stat)))\n            \n            if p_value_lag < alpha_bonferroni:\n                independence_pass = False\n                break  # Fail fast\n                \n        # Step 4: Overall Result\n        return normality_pass and independence_pass\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        {'n': 10000, 'dt': 0.001, 'seed': 123456, 'type': 'ideal', 'params': {}},\n        {'n': 10000, 'dt': 0.001, 'seed': 24681012, 'type': 'student_t', 'params': {'nu': 3}},\n        {'n': 10000, 'dt': 0.001, 'seed': 314159, 'type': 'ar1', 'params': {'rho': 0.3}},\n        {'n': 400, 'dt': 0.01, 'seed': 271828, 'type': 'ideal', 'params': {}},\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        n, dt, seed = case['n'], case['dt'], case['seed']\n        gen_type, params = case['type'], case['params']\n        \n        rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)\n        delta_W = np.array([])\n\n        if gen_type == 'ideal':\n            # Case 1 & 4: Ideal Brownian motion increments\n            xi = rng.normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=n)\n            delta_W = np.sqrt(dt) * xi\n        elif gen_type == 'student_t':\n            # Case 2: Non-normal (Student's t) but independent increments\n            nu = params['nu']\n            # Generate standard t-distributed variates\n            s_k = rng.standard_t(df=nu, size=n)\n            # Scale to have unit variance.
