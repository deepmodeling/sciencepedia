The calculation must rely on first principles: the definition of conditional expectation, the properties of Brownian motion, and the tower property of conditional expectation.\n\nThe tower property (or law of total expectation) states that for any integrable random variable $X$ and any sub-$\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{G} \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}$, we have $\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[X | \\mathcal{G}]]$. We will apply this property by conditioning on the natural filtration $\\mathcal{F}_{u}$ at time $u$. The random variable of interest is $X = W_{u} W_{t}$. Thus, we can write:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[W_{u} W_{t}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbb{E}[W_{u} W_{t} | \\mathcal{F}_{u}]\\right]\n$$\nOur first step is to evaluate the inner conditional expectation, $\\mathbb{E}[W_{u} W_{t} | \\mathcal{F}_{u}]$. A key property of conditional expectation is that any random variable that is measurable with respect to the conditioning $\\sigma$-algebra can be treated as a constant and factored out. By definition, the random variable $W_{u}$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{u}$-measurable. Therefore, we can write:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[W_{u} W_{t} | \\mathcal{F}_{u}] = W_{u} \\mathbb{E}[W_{t} | \\mathcal{F}_{u}]\n$$\nNext, we must compute $\\mathbb{E}[W_{t} | \\mathcal{F}_{u}]$. Since we are given that $u \\le t$, we can decompose the random variable $W_{t}$ into a part known at time $u$ and an independent future increment. We write $W_{t}$ as the sum of $W_{u}$ and the increment from $u$ to $t$:\n$$\nW_{t} = W_{u} + (W_{t} - W_{u})\n$$\nBy the linearity of conditional expectation, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[W_{t} | \\mathcal{F}_{u}] = \\mathbb{E}[W_{u} + (W_{t} - W_{u}) | \\mathcal{F}_{u}] = \\mathbb{E}[W_{u} | \\mathcal{F}_{u}] + \\mathbb{E}[W_{t} - W_{u} | \\mathcal{F}_{u}]\n$$\nLet us evaluate each term on the right-hand side separately.\nFor the first term, $\\mathbb{E}[W_{u} | \\mathcal{F}_{u}]$, since $W_{u}$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{u}$-measurable, its conditional expectation given $\\mathcal{F}_{u}$ is simply itself:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[W_{u} | \\mathcal{F}_{u}] = W_{u}\n$$\nFor the second term, $\\mathbb{E}[W_{t} - W_{u} | \\mathcal{F}_{u}]$, we use a fundamental property of Brownian motion: its increments are independent of the past. Specifically, for $u  t$, the increment $W_{t} - W_{u}$ is independent of the $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_{u}$. A property of conditional expectation states that if a random variable $Y$ is independent of a $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{G}$, then $\\mathbb{E}[Y | \\mathcal{G}] = \\mathbb{E}[Y]$. Applying this, we get:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[W_{t} - W_{u} | \\mathcal{F}_{u}] = \\mathbb{E}[W_{t} - W_{u}]\n$$\nFrom the definition of a standard Brownian motion, the increment $W_{t}-W_{s}$ for $s  t$ follows a Gaussian distribution with mean $0$ and variance $t-s$. In our case, $s=u$, so the mean of the increment $W_{t}-W_{u}$ is $0$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[W_{t} - W_{u}] = 0\n$$\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $\\mathbb{E}[W_{t} | \\mathcal{F}_{u}]$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[W_{t} | \\mathcal{F}_{u}] = W_{u} + 0 = W_{u}\n$$\nThis result demonstrates the martingale property of Brownian motion with respect to its natural filtration. Now, we use this to simplify the inner expectation from our original problem:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[W_{u} W_{t} | \\mathcal{F}_{u}] = W_{u} \\mathbb{E}[W_{t} | \\mathcal{F}_{u}] = W_{u} \\cdot W_{u} = W_{u}^{2}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this back into the tower property equation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[W_{u} W_{t}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[W_{u} W_{t} | \\mathcal{F}_{u}]] = \\mathbb{E}[W_{u}^{2}]\n$$\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the second moment of $W_{u}$. The variance of a random variable $X$ is defined as $\\text{Var}(X) = \\mathbb{E}[X^{2}] - (\\mathbb{E}[X])^{2}$. For the standard Brownian motion $W_{u}$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[W_{u}] = \\mathbb{E}[W_{u} - W_{0}] = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Var}(W_{u}) = \\text{Var}(W_{u} - W_{0}) = u - 0 = u\n$$\nRearranging the variance formula, we find the second moment:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[W_{u}^{2}] = \\text{Var}(W_{u}) + (\\mathbb{E}[W_{u}])^{2} = u + 0^{2} = u\n$$\nTherefore, the desired quantity is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[W_{u} W_{t}] = u\n$$\nThis result is valid for $0 \\le u \\le t$.
