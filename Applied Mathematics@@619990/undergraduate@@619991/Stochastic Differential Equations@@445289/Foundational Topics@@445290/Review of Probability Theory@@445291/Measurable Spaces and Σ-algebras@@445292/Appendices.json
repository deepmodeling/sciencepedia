We must then verify that the constructed collection of subsets satisfies the three defining properties of a $\\sigma$-algebra and determine its cardinality.\n\nFirst, let us recall the given set $\\Omega = \\{a,b,c\\}$. The two $\\sigma$-algebras to be avoided are:\n1. The trivial $\\sigma$-algebra: $\\mathcal{F}_{triv} = \\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\} = \\{\\emptyset, \\{a,b,c\\}\\}$.

The complement of the union is $(A_1 \\cup A_2)^c = A_1^c \\cap A_2^c$. Since $A_2^c$ is finite, this intersection is also finite.

The complement of the union is $(A_1 \\cup A_2)^c = A_1^c \\cap A_2^c$. The intersection of two finite sets is finite.

Its complement, $A^c = \\mathbb{N} \\setminus A = \\{1, 3, 5, \\ldots\\}$, the set of odd natural numbers, is also infinite. Since neither $A$ nor $A^c$ is finite, $A \\notin \\mathcal{A}$.\nThus, $\\mathcal{A}$ is not closed under countable unions. The statement's claims are all verified.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Let $\\Omega=\\mathbb{R}$ and let $\\mathcal{A}$ be the collection of all finite disjoint unions of half-open intervals of the form $\\left[a,b\\right)$ with $ab$. Then $\\mathcal{A}$ is a sigma ($\\sigma$)-algebra on $\\mathbb{R}$.**\n\nThis collection forms an algebra on $\\mathbb{R}$ (if we allow $a,b$ to be infinite to include $\\mathbb{R}$ itself), but it is not a $\\sigma$-algebra. This is a classic example used to motivate the construction of the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra. To show it is not a $\\sigma$-algebra, we need to find a countable operation on sets in $\\mathcal{A}$ that results in a set not in $\\mathcal{A}$.\nConsider a singleton set, for example, $\\{0\\}$. A set in $\\mathcal{A}$ is a finite union of non-empty intervals $[a,b)$ where $ab$. Any such set is either empty or contains uncountably many points. Thus, the singleton set $\\{0\\}$ cannot be expressed as a finite disjoint union of such intervals, so $\\{0\\} \\notin \\mathcal{A}$.\nNow consider the sequence of sets $A_n = [0, \\frac{1}{n})$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.

An event $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$ is in $\\sigma(Z)$ if and only if, for any outcome $\\omega \\in \\Omega$, observing the value $Z(\\omega)$ is sufficient to determine whether $\\omega \\in A$ or $\\omega \\notin A$.\n\nThe fundamental structure that $\\sigma(Z)$ captures is the partition of the sample space $\\Omega$ induced by the level sets of $Z$. For any value $c$ in the range of $Z$, the level set is $Z^{-1}(\\{c\\})$. The collection of these level sets for all $c$ in the range of $Z$ forms a partition of $\\Omega$. Any event in $\\sigma(Z)$ is a union of some of these partition elements.\n\nFor our random variable $X$, the partition induced on $\\Omega = [0,1]$ is $\\mathcal{P}_X = \\{[0,\\frac{1}{2}), [\\frac{1}{2}, 1]\\}$. Observing $X$ tells us which of these two sets the outcome $\\omega$ belongs to. If we observe $X(\\omega)=1$, we know $\\omega \\in [0,\\frac{1}{2})$. If we observe $X(\\omega)=0$, we know $\\omega \\in [\\frac{1}{2}, 1]$. The $\\sigma$-algebra $\\sigma(X)$ consists of precisely the sets whose occurrence can be determined from this information: $\\emptyset$, $[0,\\frac{1}{2})$, $[\\frac{1}{2}, 1]$, and their union $[0,1]$.\n\nFor the random variable $Y$, the values assigned to the partition elements are different ($2$ and $0$ instead of $1$ and $0$), but the underlying partition of $\\Omega$ is identical: $\\mathcal{P}_Y = \\{[0,\\frac{1}{2}), [\\frac{1}{2}, 1]\\}$. Observing $Y(\\omega)=2$ tells us $\\omega \\in [0,\\frac{1}{2})$, and observing $Y(\\omega)=0$ tells us $\\omega \\in [\\frac{1}{2}, 1]$. This is the exact same information about the location of $\\omega$ as provided by $X$.\n\nThe fact that $\\sigma(X)=\\sigma(Y)$ demonstrates that the generated $\\sigma$-algebra is insensitive to the specific numerical values (the \"labels\") that a random variable assigns to the sets in the partition it induces. The information content is solely determined by the partition itself—which sets of outcomes are distinguishable. Here, both $X$ and $Y$ distinguish the outcomes in $[0,\\frac{1}{2})$ from the outcomes in $[\\frac{1}{2}, 1]$, and provide no further refinement. Since they make the same distinctions, they carry the same information, and thus generate the same $\\sigma$-algebra. This holds more generally: if $Z_2 = g(Z_1)$ for some function $g$ that is one-to-one on the range of $Z_1$, then $\\sigma(Z_1)=\\sigma(Z_2)$. Here, $Y=g(X)$ with $g(x)=2x$, which is one-to-one on the range $\\{0,1\\}$ of $X$.\n\n### Part 3: Compute $\\mathbb{P}(X\\neq Y)$.\n\nAs calculated in Part 1, the event $\\{X\\neq Y\\}$ is the set of $\\omega \\in \\Omega$ for which $X(\\omega)\\neq Y(\\omega)$. This occurs precisely when $\\omega \\in [0, \\frac{1}{2})$. The probability measure $\\mathbb{P}$ is the Lebesgue measure on $[0,1]$. Therefore, the probability of this event is the length of the interval.\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(X\\neq Y) = \\mathbb{P}([0, \\frac{1}{2})) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "3066358"}]}
