Since all open sets are in $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$, it follows that $C^{c} \\in \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$.

Therefore, every closed set is a Borel set. This fact will be used in both parts of the problem.\n\nThe problem states that \"continuous functions map open sets to open sets via preimages.\" This is the standard definition of continuity: a function $f: X \\to Y$ is continuous if and only if for every open set $U \\subseteq Y$, the preimage $f^{-1}(U)$ is an open set in $X$. A direct consequence, which we will use, is that the preimage of a closed set under a continuous function is closed. To see this, let $C \\subseteq Y$ be a closed set. Its complement $Y \\setminus C$ is open. By continuity, $f^{-1}(Y \\setminus C)$ is open in $X$. Using the property that the preimage of a set difference is the difference of the preimages, we have $f^{-1}(Y \\setminus C) = f^{-1}(Y) \\setminus f^{-1}(C) = X \\setminus f^{-1}(C)$. Since $X \\setminus f^{-1}(C)$ is open, its complement, $f^{-1}(C)$, must be closed.\n\n**Part 1: Polytope $P$**\n\nFirst, we prove that any polytope $P \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a Borel set. A polytope is defined as a finite intersection of affine half-spaces. An affine half-space can be represented by an inequality of the form $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot x \\leq b$ for some vector $\\mathbf{a} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and a scalar $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Let us define a function $f: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ by $f(x) = \\mathbf{a} \\cdot x$. This is a linear function and is therefore continuous. The affine half-space is the set $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} : f(x) \\leq b \\}$. This can be written as the preimage of the interval $(-\\infty, b]$ under the function $f$, i.e., $f^{-1}((-\\infty, b])$. The interval $(-\\infty, b]$ is a closed set in $\\mathbb{R}$. As established, the preimage of a closed set under a continuous function is closed. Thus, each affine half-space is a closed set.\nA polytope $P$ is the intersection of a finite number of such half-spaces, $P = \\bigcap_{i=1}^{k} H_{i}$, where each $H_{i}$ is an affine half-space. Since each $H_i$ is a closed set, and the problem states that a finite intersection of closed sets is closed, the polytope $P$ is a closed set. As shown in the introduction, every closed set is a Borel set. Therefore, any polytope $P$ is a Borel set.\n\nNext, we compute the Lebesgue measure $\\lambda_{n}(P)$ for the specific polytope $P = [0,a_{1}] \\times [0,a_{2}] \\times \\cdots \\times [0,a_{n}]$, where $a_{i} \\in (0,\\infty)$ for $i=1,\\dots,n$. This set is an axis-aligned hyperrectangle. The problem states that the $n$-dimensional Lebesgue measure $\\lambda_{n}$ extends the usual length on $\\mathbb{R}$ and satisfies the product measure property for axis-aligned rectangles. The length of a closed interval $[0, a_{i}]$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ is its Lebesgue measure $\\lambda_{1}([0, a_{i}]) = a_{i} - 0 = a_{i}$. Applying the product measure property, the measure of the Cartesian product $P$ is the product of the measures of the individual intervals:\n$$\n\\lambda_{n}(P) = \\lambda_{n}([0,a_{1}] \\times \\cdots \\times [0,a_{n}]) = \\lambda_{1}([0,a_{1}]) \\cdots \\lambda_{1}([0,a_{n}]) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}.\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Ellipsoid $E$**\n\nFirst, we prove that the ellipsoid $E$ is a Borel set. The ellipsoid is defined as\n$$\nE = \\left\\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} : \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(\\frac{x_{i}-c_{i}}{r_{i}}\\right)^{2} \\leq 1 \\right\\}.\n$$\nLet us define a function $g: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ by\n$$\ng(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(\\frac{x_{i}-c_{i}}{r_{i}}\\right)^{2}.\n$$\nThis function $g$ is a polynomial in the coordinates $x_1, \\dots, x_n$, and is therefore continuous. The ellipsoid $E$ is the set of points $x$ for which $g(x) \\leq 1$. This can be expressed as the preimage of the interval $(-\\infty, 1]$ under $g$, i.e., $E = g^{-1}((-\\infty, 1])$. The interval $(-\\infty, 1]$ is a closed set in $\\mathbb{R}$. Since $g$ is continuous, the preimage $E$ must be a closed set in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. As every closed set is a Borel set, the ellipsoid $E$ is a Borel set.\n\nNext, we compute the Lebesgue measure $\\lambda_{n}(E)$. We will relate the ellipsoid $E$ to the unit $n$-ball, $B^{n}(0,1) = \\{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} : \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_{i}^{2} \\leq 1 \\}$, using an affine transformation. Consider the transformation $S: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ defined by $S(y) = x$, where the components are related by $x_{i} = r_{i}y_{i} + c_{i}$ for $i=1,\\dots,n$. This is an affine transformation which can be written as $S(y) = Dy + c$, where $c = (c_{1},\\dots,c_{n})$ is the translation vector and $D$ is the linear transformation represented by a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries $d_{ii} = r_{i}$.\nLet $y \\in B^{n}(0,1)$. Then $x=S(y)$ satisfies $y_i = (x_i-c_i)/r_i$. Substituting this into the inequality for the unit ball:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_{i}^{2} \\leq 1 \\implies \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(\\frac{x_{i}-c_{i}}{r_{i}}\\right)^{2} \\leq 1.\n$$\nThis shows that $S$ maps the unit ball $B^{n}(0,1)$ onto the ellipsoid $E$, so $E = S(B^{n}(0,1))$. The volume of $E$ is $\\lambda_{n}(E) = \\lambda_{n}(S(B^{n}(0,1))) = \\lambda_{n}(D(B^{n}(0,1)) + c)$.\nThe problem states that the Lebesgue measure is invariant under translations, so $\\lambda_{n}(A+c) = \\lambda_{n}(A)$. Applying this, we get:\n$$\n\\lambda_{n}(E) = \\lambda_{n}(D(B^{n}(0,1))).\n$$\nThe problem also states that for a linear transformation $T$, the measure scales by the absolute value of the determinant: $\\lambda_{n}(T(A)) = |\\det(T)| \\lambda_{n}(A)$. The determinant of the diagonal matrix $D$ is the product of its diagonal entries: $\\det(D) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} r_{i}$. Since all $r_{i} \\in (0,\\infty)$, the determinant is positive, so $|\\det(D)| = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} r_{i}$.\nApplying this scaling property, we find:\n$$\n\\lambda_{n}(E) = |\\det(D)| \\lambda_{n}(B^{n}(0,1)) = \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{n} r_{i}\\right) \\lambda_{n}(B^{n}(0,1)).\n$$\nWe are given the volume of the unit ball: $\\lambda_{n}(B^{n}(0,1)) = \\frac{\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2}+1)}$. Substituting this gives the closed-form expression for the volume of the ellipsoid:\n$$\n\\lambda_{n}(E) = \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{n} r_{i}\\right) \\frac{\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}+1\\right)}.\n$$\n\nThe two requested results are $\\lambda_{n}(P) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}$ and $\\lambda_{n}(E) = \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{n} r_{i}\\right) \\frac{\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2}+1)}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\prod_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} & \\frac{\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2}+1)} \\prod_{i=1}^{n} r_{i} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3040698"}, {"introduction": "One of the primary motivations for developing measure theory was to build a powerful and rigorous theory of integration.

The denominator, $(1+x^2)(1+y^2)$, is a product of two terms, each of which is always greater than or equal to $1$. Thus, the denominator is never zero for any $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$.

Applicability of Tonelli's Theorem**\n\nTonelli's theorem applies to non-negative measurable functions on a product of $\\sigma$-finite measure spaces. Let's state the theorem in the context of our problem: Let $(X, \\mathcal{A}, \\mu)$ and $(Y, \\mathcal{B}, \\nu)$ be $\\sigma$-finite measure spaces. If $g: X \\times Y \\to [0, \\infty]$ is a measurable function with respect to the product $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{A} \\otimes \\mathcal{B}$, then the iterated integrals are equal to the double integral, i.e.,\n$$ \\int_{X \\times Y} g \\,d(\\mu \\otimes \\nu) = \\int_{X} \\left( \\int_{Y} g(x,y) \\,d\\nu(y) \\right) d\\mu(x) = \\int_{Y} \\left( \\int_{X} g(x,y) \\,d\\mu(x) \\right) d\\nu(y). $$\nTo justify its application to $f(x,y)$ on $(\\mathbb{R}^2, \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R}^2))$ with the Lebesgue measure, we must verify the hypotheses:\n- **Measure Spaces**: Our measure spaces are $(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R}), \\lambda)$, where $\\lambda$ is the one-dimensional Lebesgue measure. The Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb{R}$ is $\\sigma$-finite because $\\mathbb{R}$ can be written as a countable union of sets of finite measure, for instance, $\\mathbb{R} = \\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} [n, n+1]$, where $\\lambda([n, n+1])=1 < \\infty$.\n- **Non-negativity**: The function is $f(x,y) = \\frac{1}{(1+x^2)(1+y^2)}$. For any real numbers $x$ and $y$, $x^2 \\ge 0$ and $y^2 \\ge 0$. Thus, $1+x^2 \\ge 1$ and $1+y^2 \\ge 1$. Their product is also greater than or equal to $1$, so $f(x,y) > 0$ for all $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. The function maps to $[0, \\infty)$ (more specifically, to $(0,1]$), so it is a non-negative function.\n- **Measurability**: As established in the first part, $f$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and therefore is $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$-measurable. The product $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R}) \\otimes \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})$ is precisely the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$.\n\nSince all conditions are met, Tonelli's theorem is applicable to the function $f$.\n\n**3. Applicability of Fubini's Theorem**\n\nFubini's theorem is similar to Tonelli's theorem but applies to integrable functions which may take both positive and negative values. For the same $\\sigma$-finite measure spaces as above, Fubini's theorem states that if a function $g: X \\times Y \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is integrable, meaning it is measurable and its absolute value has a finite integral, $\\int_{X \\times Y} |g| \\,d(\\mu \\otimes \\nu) < \\infty$, then the iterated integrals exist and are equal to the double integral.\n\nThe crucial condition for Fubini's theorem to apply to our function $f$ is that $f$ must be integrable over $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure. This means we must verify that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^2} |f(x,y)| \\,dx\\,dy < \\infty$.\n\nSince $f(x,y) > 0$ for all $(x,y)$, we have $|f(x,y)| = f(x,y)$. The condition for Fubini's theorem becomes $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^2} f(x,y) \\,dx\\,dy < \\infty$.\n\nWe can use Tonelli's theorem (which we have already justified) to evaluate this integral of the non-negative function $f$. If the result is finite, then the condition for Fubini's theorem is met.\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^2} f(x,y) \\,dx\\,dy = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\left( \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\frac{1}{(1+x^2)(1+y^2)} \\,dy \\right) dx $$\nWe compute the inner integral:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\frac{1}{(1+x^2)(1+y^2)} \\,dy = \\frac{1}{1+x^2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+y^2} \\,dy $$\nThe integral of $\\frac{1}{1+y^2}$ is a standard result:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+y^2} \\,dy = [\\arctan(y)]_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} = \\lim_{b\\to\\infty} \\arctan(b) - \\lim_{a\\to-\\infty} \\arctan(a) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\pi. $$\nSubstituting this result back:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^2} f(x,y) \\,dx\\,dy = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+x^2} (\\pi) \\,dx = \\pi \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+x^2} \\,dx $$\nThe remaining integral is identical in form to the one just calculated, so its value is also $\\pi$.\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^2} f(x,y) \\,dx\\,dy = \\pi \\cdot \\pi = \\pi^2. $$\nSince the integral evaluates to $\\pi^2$, which is a finite value, we have shown that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^2} |f(x,y)| \\,dx\\,dy = \\pi^2 < \\infty$. Therefore, the function $f$ is integrable, and the condition for Fubini's theorem is satisfied.\n\n**4. Computation of the Double Integral**\n\nAs demonstrated in the justification for Fubini's theorem, we can compute the integral using Tonelli's theorem. Since the function $f(x,y)$ is a product of a function of $x$ and a function of $y$, i.e., $f(x,y) = g(x)h(y)$ with $g(x) = \\frac{1}{1+x^2}$ and $h(y) = \\frac{1}{1+y^2}$, the double integral over the rectangular domain $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ can be separated into a product of two single-variable integrals:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{2}} \\frac{1}{(1+x^{2})(1+y^{2})}\\,dx\\,dy = \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+x^{2}} \\,dx \\right) \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+y^{2}} \\,dy \\right). $$\nWe have already computed the value of this standard definite integral:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+t^2} \\,dt = [\\arctan(t)]_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} = \\pi. $$\nTherefore, the double integral is:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{2}} f(x,y)\\,dx\\,dy = (\\pi) \\cdot (\\pi) = \\pi^2. $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\pi^{2}}$$", "id": "3040713"}]}
