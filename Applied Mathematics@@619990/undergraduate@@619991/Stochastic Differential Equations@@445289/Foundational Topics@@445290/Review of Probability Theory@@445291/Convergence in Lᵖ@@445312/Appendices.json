This sequence must satisfy several specified properties concerning convergence. We will construct such a sequence, verify that it meets all the stated criteria, provide an explanation for its convergence behavior based on the concept of uniform integrability, and finally compute the requested limit superior for our constructed sequence.\n\nFirst, we establish the framework for our construction. Let the limit random variable be the zero function, $X(\\omega) = 0$ for all $\\omega \\in [0,1]$. We define the sequence of random variables $\\{X_n\\}_{n \\ge 1}$ on this space as a \"traveling spike\" that becomes progressively taller and narrower. For any fixed $p \\ge 1$, we define $X_n$ for $n \\ge 1$ as:\n$$\nX_n(\\omega) = n^{1/p} \\mathbf{1}_{[0, 1/n]}(\\omega)\n$$\nThis means $X_n(\\omega) = n^{1/p}$ if $\\omega \\in [0, 1/n]$ and $X_n(\\omega) = 0$ if $\\omega \\in (1/n, 1]$.\n\nWe now verify that this sequence and its limit $X=0$ satisfy all the required properties.\n\n1.  **Convergence in probability**: We must show that $X_n \\to 0$ in probability, which means $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\mathbb{P}(|X_n - 0| > \\varepsilon) = 0$ for every $\\varepsilon > 0$.\n    For any given $\\varepsilon > 0$, consider the inequality $|X_n(\\omega)| > \\varepsilon$, which is $n^{1/p} > \\varepsilon$. Since $p \\ge 1$ is fixed, the term $n^{1/p}$ grows to infinity as $n \\to \\infty$. Therefore, we can find an integer $N$ such that for all $n > N$, we have $n^{1/p} > \\varepsilon$. For any such $n$, the set of $\\omega$ where $|X_n(\\omega)| > \\varepsilon$ is precisely the set where $X_n(\\omega) = n^{1/p}$, which is the interval $[0, 1/n]$.\n    The probability of this event is its Lebesgue measure:\n    $$\n    \\mathbb{P}(|X_n| > \\varepsilon) = \\mathbb{P}([0, 1/n]) = \\frac{1}{n}\n    $$\n    As $n \\to \\infty$, we have $\\mathbb{P}(|X_n| > \\varepsilon) = \\frac{1}{n} \\to 0$. Thus, $X_n \\to 0$ in probability.\n\n2.  **Boundedness of $p$-th moments**: We need to show that $\\sup_n \\mathbb{E}[|X_n|^p]  \\infty$.\n    We compute the expectation of $|X_n|^p$ by integrating over $\\Omega = [0,1]$:\n    $$\n    \\mathbb{E}[|X_n|^p] = \\int_0^1 |X_n(\\omega)|^p \\,d\\omega = \\int_0^{1/n} (n^{1/p})^p \\,d\\omega + \\int_{1/n}^1 0^p \\,d\\omega = \\int_0^{1/n} n \\,d\\omega = n \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{n} - 0\\right) = 1\n    $$\n    Since $\\mathbb{E}[|X_n|^p] = 1$ for all integers $n \\ge 1$, the supremum of these values is $\\sup_n \\mathbb{E}[|X_n|^p] = 1$, which is finite.\n\n3.  **Failure of convergence in $L^p$**: We must demonstrate that $X_n$ does not converge to $X=0$ in $L^p$. This requires showing that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\mathbb{E}[|X_n - 0|^p] \\neq 0$.\n    From the previous calculation, we have that $\\mathbb{E}[|X_n - 0|^p] = \\mathbb{E}[|X_n|^p] = 1$ for all $n \\ge 1$.\n    Therefore, the limit is:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\mathbb{E}[|X_n - 0|^p] = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} 1 = 1\n    $$\n    Since this limit is $1$ and not $0$, the sequence $\\{X_n\\}$ does not converge to $0$ in $L^p$.\n\nNext, we explain why the failure of uniform integrability obstructs $L^p$ convergence. The Vitali Convergence Theorem states that for a sequence of random variables $\\{Z_n\\}$ in $L^1$, convergence $Z_n \\to Z$ in $L^1$ holds if and only if $Z_n \\to Z$ in probability and the family $\\{Z_n\\}$ is uniformly integrable. Let $Y_n = |X_n - X|^p = |X_n|^p$. Then $L^p$ convergence of $X_n$ to $X$ is equivalent to $L^1$ convergence of $Y_n$ to $Y=0$. We have established that $Y_n \\to 0$ in probability. According to the theorem, the failure of $L^1$ convergence (and thus $L^p$ convergence) must be due to the fact that the family $\\{Y_n\\} = \\{|X_n|^p\\}$ is not uniformly integrable.\n\nLet's show this explicitly. By definition, $\\{Y_n\\}$ is uniformly integrable if $\\lim_{M \\to \\infty} \\sup_n \\mathbb{E}[|Y_n| \\mathbf{1}_{\\{|Y_n| > M\\}}] = 0$. In our construction, $Y_n(\\omega) = n \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{[0, 1/n]}(\\omega)$. The random variable $Y_n$ only takes values $n$ or $0$.\nThe condition $|Y_n| > M$ is met only if $n > M$.\n- If $n \\le M$, the set $\\{\\omega: |Y_n(\\omega)| > M\\}$ is empty, so $\\mathbb{E}[|Y_n| \\mathbf{1}_{\\{|Y_n| > M\\}}] = 0$.\n- If $n > M$, the set $\\{\\omega: |Y_n(\\omega)| > M\\}$ is the interval $[0, 1/n]$. For such $n$:\n  $$\n  \\mathbb{E}[|Y_n| \\mathbf{1}_{\\{|Y_n| > M\\}}] = \\mathbb{E}[n \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{[0, 1/n]}] = n \\cdot \\mathbb{P}([0, 1/n]) = n \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} = 1\n  $$\nFor any $M > 0$, we can always find an integer $n > M$. Thus, the supremum over all $n$ will always include values of $1$:\n$$\n\\sup_n \\mathbb{E}[|Y_n| \\mathbf{1}_{\\{|Y_n| > M\\}}] = \\sup(\\{0 \\text{ for } n \\le M\\} \\cup \\{1 \\text{ for } n > M\\}) = 1\n$$\nTaking the limit as $M \\to \\infty$:\n$$\n\\lim_{M \\to \\infty} \\sup_n \\mathbb{E}[|Y_n| \\mathbf{1}_{\\{|Y_n| > M\\}}] = \\lim_{M \\to \\infty} 1 = 1\n$$\nSince this limit is not $0$, the family $\\{|X_n|^p\\}$ is not uniformly integrable. This failure reflects that a persistent amount of the integral's mass ($1$ in this case) comes from arbitrarily large values of $|X_n|^p$, even as the probability of observing these values shrinks. This \"escaping mass\" prevents the total integral from converging to $0$.\n\nFinally, we compute the value of the requested limit superior for our constructed sequence. We need to find $\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} \\mathbb{E}[|X_n - X|^p]$.\nAs we have shown, for our choice of $X_n$ and $X=0$, the expectation is constant for all $n \\ge 1$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[|X_n - X|^p] = 1\n$$\nThe limit superior of a constant sequence $\\{1, 1, 1, \\dots\\}$ is simply the value of the constant.\n$$\n\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} \\mathbb{E}[|X_n - X|^p] = \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} 1 = 1\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3046407"}, {"introduction": "Now, let's apply these abstract convergence principles to the core of our study: the Itô stochastic integral.

That is, $W_{s} - W_{r} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, s-r)$.\nIn our case, the increment is $W_{n+1/n^{2}} - W_{n}$. The time difference is $(n+1/n^{2}) - n = 1/n^{2}$.\nSo, the increment has the distribution $W_{n+1/n^{2}} - W_{n} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1/n^2)$.\nThe random variable $I_n$ is this increment scaled by the constant $n$.

The differential is $\\mathrm{d}z = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2u}} \\cdot 2\\,\\mathrm{d}u = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2u}}\\mathrm{d}u$.\nSubstituting these into the integral gives:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} (\\sqrt{2u})^p \\exp(-u) \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2u}}\\mathrm{d}u = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (2u)^{p/2} (2u)^{-1/2} \\exp(-u) \\mathrm{d}u = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} 2^{(p-1)/2} u^{(p-1)/2} \\exp(-u) \\mathrm{d}u.\n$$\nThis can be expressed using the Gamma function, $\\Gamma(x) = \\int_0^\\infty t^{x-1} e^{-t} \\mathrm{d}t$.\n$$\n2^{(p-1)/2} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} u^{\\frac{p+1}{2}-1} \\exp(-u) \\mathrm{d}u = 2^{(p-1)/2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{p+1}{2}\\right).\n$$\nNow, we combine this with the pre-factor:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[|Z|^p] = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\cdot 2^{(p-1)/2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{p+1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2^1}{2^{1/2}\\pi^{1/2}} \\cdot 2^{(p-1)/2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{p+1}{2}\\right) = 2^{1 - 1/2 + (p-1)/2} \\pi^{-1/2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{p+1}{2}\\right).\n$$\nSimplifying the exponent of $2$:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{p-1}{2} = \\frac{2-1+p-1}{2} = \\frac{p}{2}.\n$$\nThus, the expectation is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[|I_{n}|^p] = \\mathbb{E}[|Z|^p] = 2^{p/2} \\pi^{-1/2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{p+1}{2}\\right).\n$$\nSince this value is independent of $n$, the limit is the value itself.\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\,|I_{n}|^{p}\\,\\right] = 2^{p/2} \\pi^{-1/2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{p+1}{2}\\right).\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Explanation of non-convergence in $L^p$**\n\nWe have shown that $H_n(t) \\to 0$ for every fixed $t \\geq 0$. However, the sequence of Itô integrals $I_n$ does not converge to $0$ in $L^p(\\Omega)$. Convergence of $I_n$ to $0$ in $L^p$ would require $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\mathbb{E}[|I_n - 0|^p] = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\mathbb{E}[|I_n|^p] = 0$.\nOur calculation in Part 2 shows that this limit is a positive constant for any $p>0$, since $2^{p/2}>0$, $\\pi^{-1/2}>0$, and $\\Gamma((p+1)/2)>0$ for $p>0$. Therefore, $I_n$ does not converge to $0$ in $L^p$.\n\nThis example demonstrates that pointwise convergence of integrands is not a sufficient condition for the convergence of the corresponding Itô integrals in $L^p$. The reason lies in the failure of a crucial condition, often found in dominated convergence-type theorems for stochastic integrals.\n\nFor the special case of $p=2$, the Itô isometry states that $\\mathbb{E}[I_n^2] = \\mathbb{E}[\\int_0^\\infty H_n(t)^2 \\mathrm{d}t]$. Since $H_n$ is deterministic, this simplifies to $\\mathbb{E}[I_n^2] = \\int_0^\\infty H_n(t)^2 \\mathrm{d}t$.\nLet's compute this integral:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty H_n(t)^2 \\mathrm{d}t = \\int_0^\\infty \\left(n\\,\\mathbf{1}_{(n,\\,n+1/n^{2}]}(t)\\right)^2 \\mathrm{d}t = \\int_n^{n+1/n^2} n^2 \\mathrm{d}t = n^2 \\left( (n+1/n^2) - n \\right) = n^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{n^2} = 1.\n$$\nThis result is consistent with our general finding for $p=2$: $\\mathbb{E}[I_n^2] = 2^{2/2}\\pi^{-1/2}\\Gamma(3/2) = 2\\pi^{-1/2}(\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\pi}) = 1$.\nThe $L^2$ convergence theorem for Itô integrals states that if $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\mathbb{E}[\\int_0^\\infty (H_n(t) - H(t))^2 \\mathrm{d}t] = 0$, then $I_n \\to I$ in $L^2(\\Omega)$. Here, $H(t)=0$. The condition becomes $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\int_0^\\infty H_n(t)^2 \\mathrm{d}t = 0$. We have just shown this limit is $1$, not $0$. The condition is not met, and indeed, the conclusion does not hold.\n\nThe problem asks to highlight the role of the \"absence of a uniform $L^2$-dominating envelope over time\". This refers to the fact that there is no single function $K(t) \\in L^2(\\mathbb{R}_+)$, i.e., $\\int_0^\\infty K(t)^2 \\mathrm{d}t  \\infty$, such that $|H_n(t)| \\leq K(t)$ for all $n$ and almost all $t$.\nIf such a dominating function $K(t)$ existed, then we would have $|H_n(t)|^2 \\leq K(t)^2$. Since we know $H_n(t)^2 \\to 0$ for each $t$, the Lebesgue Dominated Convergence Theorem would apply to the sequence of functions $f_n(t) = H_n(t)^2$:\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\int_0^\\infty H_n(t)^2 \\mathrm{d}t = \\int_0^\\infty \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} H_n(t)^2 \\mathrm{d}t = \\int_0^\\infty 0 \\mathrm{d}t = 0.\n$$\nThis would imply $L^2$ convergence of the integrals. However, our calculation shows $\\int_0^\\infty H_n(t)^2 \\mathrm{d}t = 1$, so such a dominating function cannot exist. The peak of the integrand $H_n(t)$ grows as $n$, preventing the existence of an $L^2$-integrable envelope. The \"mass\" of the integrand, measured by its $L^2$ norm, does not vanish but instead \"escapes to infinity\" along the time axis, maintaining a constant value of $1$.

The random variable $\\mathbf{1}_{A_n}$ is constant with respect to the time variable $s$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} |H^n_s|^2\\,\\mathrm{d}s = \\int_{0}^{T} n^2\\,\\mathbf{1}_{A_n}\\,\\mathrm{d}s = n^2\\,\\mathbf{1}_{A_n} \\int_{0}^{T} \\mathrm{d}s = n^2\\,T\\,\\mathbf{1}_{A_n}.\n$$\nNext, we take the expectation with respect to the probability measure $\\mathbb{P}$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\int_{0}^{T} |H^n_s|^2\\,\\mathrm{d}s\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[n^2\\,T\\,\\mathbf{1}_{A_n}\\right] = n^2\\,T\\,\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\mathbf{1}_{A_n}\\right].\n$$\nThe expectation of an indicator function of an event is the probability of that event, $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{1}_{A_n}] = \\mathbb{P}(A_n)$. We are given that $\\mathbb{P}(A_n) = n^{-p}$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\int_{0}^{T} |H^n_s|^2\\,\\mathrm{d}s\\right] = n^2\\,T\\,n^{-p} = T\\,n^{2-p}.\n$$\nWe are given that $p2$, which implies $2-p  0$. Therefore, as $n \\to \\infty$, the term $n^{2-p}$ approaches $0$.\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\int_{0}^{T} |H^n_s|^2\\,\\mathrm{d}s\\right] = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} T\\,n^{2-p} = 0.\n$$\nThis verifies that $H^n \\to 0$ in $L^2(\\Omega\\times[0,T])$.\n\nNow, we proceed to compute the limit of the expectation of the $p$-th power of the supremum of the stochastic integral $M_t^n = \\int_{0}^{t} H^n_s\\,\\mathrm{d}W_s$.\nFirst, we express $M_t^n$ more explicitly. Since $A_n \\in \\mathcal{F}_0$, the process $\\mathbf{1}_{A_n}$ is $\\mathcal{F}_0$-measurable, and therefore predictable. We can pull the random variable $\\mathbf{1}_{A_n}$ and the constant $n$ out of the stochastic integral.\n$$\nM_t^n = \\int_{0}^{t} n\\,\\mathbf{1}_{A_n}\\,\\mathbf{1}_{[0,T]}(s)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_s = n\\,\\mathbf{1}_{A_n} \\int_{0}^{t} \\mathrm{d}W_s = n\\,\\mathbf{1}_{A_n}\\,W_t, \\quad \\text{for } t \\in [0,T].\n$$\nNext, we find the supremum of the absolute value of this process over the interval $[0,T]$.\n$$\n\\sup_{0\\le t\\le T} \\left|M_t^n\\right| = \\sup_{0\\le t\\le T} \\left|n\\,\\mathbf{1}_{A_n}\\,W_t\\right| = n\\,|\\mathbf{1}_{A_n}| \\sup_{0\\le t\\le T} |W_t| = n\\,\\mathbf{1}_{A_n} \\sup_{0\\le t\\le T} |W_t|.\n$$\nWe are interested in the expectation of the $p$-th power of this expression.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\sup_{0\\le t\\le T} \\left|M_t^n\\right|^{p}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\left(n\\,\\mathbf{1}_{A_n} \\sup_{0\\le t\\le T} |W_t|\\right)^p\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[n^p\\,\\mathbf{1}_{A_n}^p \\left(\\sup_{0\\le t\\le T} |W_t|\\right)^p\\right].\n$$\nUsing $\\mathbf{1}_{A_n}^p = \\mathbf{1}_{A_n}$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[n^p\\,\\mathbf{1}_{A_n} \\left(\\sup_{0\\le t\\le T} |W_t|\\right)^p\\right].\n$$\nThe problem states that the event $A_n$ is independent of the Brownian motion $\\{W_t\\}_{t\\in[0,T]}$. This means the random variable $\\mathbf{1}_{A_n}$ is independent of the random variable $\\sup_{0\\le t\\le T} |W_t|$. For independent random variables, the expectation of their product is the product of their expectations.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\sup_{0\\le t\\le T} \\left|M_t^n\\right|^{p}\\right] = n^p\\,\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\mathbf{1}_{A_n}\\right]\\,\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\left(\\sup_{0\\le t\\le T} |W_t|\\right)^p\\right].\n$$\nSubstituting $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{1}_{A_n}]=\\mathbb{P}(A_n)=n^{-p}$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\sup_{0\\le t\\le T} \\left|M_t^n\\right|^{p}\\right] = n^p\\,n^{-p}\\,\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\left(\\sup_{0\\le t\\le T} |W_t|\\right)^p\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\left(\\sup_{0\\le t\\le T} |W_t|\\right)^p\\right].\n$$\nThis expression is a constant with respect to $n$. Therefore, its limit as $n\\to\\infty$ is the expression itself.\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\,\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\sup_{0\\le t\\le T} \\left|M_t^n\\right|^{p}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\left(\\sup_{0\\le t\\le T} |W_t|\\right)^p\\right].\n$$\nSince $p>0$, this expectation is strictly positive, proving that the sequence of stochastic integrals does not converge to $0$ in the specified $L^p$ sense.\n\nFinally, we must express this result in the required form, standardized on the unit interval $[0,1]$ using Brownian scaling. The scaling property of Brownian motion states that for any constant $c>0$, the process $\\{W_{ct}\\}_{t\\ge 0}$ has the same distribution as the process $\\{\\sqrt{c}\\,W_t\\}_{t\\ge 0}$.\nLet $t=Tu$, where $u \\in [0,1]$. Then $\\{W_{Tu}\\}_{u\\in[0,1]}$ has the same distribution as $\\{\\sqrt{T}\\,W_u\\}_{u\\in[0,1]}$.\nTherefore, the random variable $\\sup_{0\\le t\\le T}|W_t| = \\sup_{0\\le u\\le 1}|W_{Tu}|$ has the same distribution as $\\sup_{0\\le u\\le 1}|\\sqrt{T}\\,W_u| = \\sqrt{T}\\sup_{0\\le u\\le 1}|W_u|$.\nThis implies that their moments are equal.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\left(\\sup_{0\\le t\\le T} |W_t|\\right)^p\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\left(\\sqrt{T}\\sup_{0\\le u\\le 1} |W_u|\\right)^p\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[T^{\\frac{p}{2}}\\left(\\sup_{0\\le u\\le 1} |W_u|\\right)^p\\right].\n$$\nPulling the constant $T^{\\frac{p}{2}}$ out of the expectation gives the final expression:\n$$\nT^{\\frac{p}{2}} \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\left(\\sup_{0\\le u\\le 1} |W_u|\\right)^p\\right].\n$$\nAs per the problem's instructions, this is a closed-form expression in terms of $T$, $p$, and a universal constant defined by an expectation of a functional of standard Brownian motion on the unit interval.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{T^{\\frac{p}{2}} \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\left(\\sup_{0\\le t\\le 1} |W_t|\\right)^{p}\\right]}$$", "id": "3046412"}]}
