It is a standard problem in the field of mathematical finance, based on the Black-Scholes-Merton framework with deterministic, time-dependent coefficients. We can thus proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe value at time $t$ of a forward contract with delivery price $K$ and maturity $T$ is the risk-neutral expectation of its discounted payoff. The payoff at time $T$ is $S_T - K$. The discount factor from $T$ to $t$ is $P(t,T) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_t^T r(u) du\\right)$. Since the interest rate $r(t)$ is deterministic, this discount factor is non-stochastic and can be pulled out of the expectation. The time-$t$ value of the forward contract, $V_t(S_t, t; K)$, is therefore:\n$$\nV_t(S_t, t; K) = E_t^{\\mathbb{Q}} \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\int_t^T r(u) du\\right) (S_T - K) \\right] = P(t,T) \\left( E_t^{\\mathbb{Q}}[S_T] - K \\right)\n$$\nwhere $E_t^{\\mathbb{Q}}[\\cdot]$ denotes the expectation under the risk-neutral measure $\\mathbb{Q}$ conditional on the information available at time $t$.\n\n**1. Fair Forward Price $F_{t,T}$**\n\nThe fair forward price $F_{t,T}$ is the delivery price $K$ that makes the initial value of the contract zero. Setting $V_t = 0$ and $K = F_{t,T}$ in the valuation formula gives:\n$$\n0 = P(t,T) \\left( E_t^{\\mathbb{Q}}[S_T] - F_{t,T} \\right)\n$$\nSince $P(t,T) > 0$, this implies that the fair forward price is the conditional risk-neutral expectation of the future spot price:\n$$\nF_{t,T} = E_t^{\\mathbb{Q}}[S_T]\n$$\nTo calculate this expectation, we must first find the distribution of $S_T$. The SDE for $S_t$ is given as:\n$$\ndS_t = S_t (r(t) - q(t) + c(t)) dt + S_t \\sigma(t) dW_t\n$$\nLet $X_t = \\ln S_t$. By Itô's lemma for $f(S_t) = \\ln S_t$, we have:\n$$\ndX_t = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial S_t} dS_t + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial S_t^2} (dS_t)^2 = \\frac{1}{S_t} dS_t - \\frac{1}{2S_t^2} (S_t \\sigma(t) dW_t)^2\n$$\n$$\ndX_t = (r(t) - q(t) + c(t)) dt + \\sigma(t) dW_t - \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma(t)^2 dt\n$$\n$$\ndX_t = \\left( r(t) - q(t) + c(t) - \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma(t)^2 \\right) dt + \\sigma(t) dW_t\n$$\nIntegrating from $t$ to $T$:\n$$\n\\ln(S_T) - \\ln(S_t) = \\int_t^T \\left( r(u) - q(u) + c(u) - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma(u)^2 \\right) du + \\int_t^T \\sigma(u) dW_u\n$$\nSo, $S_T$ can be expressed as:\n$$\nS_T = S_t \\exp\\left( \\int_t^T \\left( r(u) - q(u) + c(u) - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma(u)^2 \\right) du + \\int_t^T \\sigma(u) dW_u \\right)\n$$\nNow we compute the expectation $E_t^{\\mathbb{Q}}[S_T]$. The term $\\int_t^T \\sigma(u) dW_u$ is a normally distributed random variable with mean $0$ and variance $\\int_t^T \\sigma(u)^2 du$.

Hedge Ratios**\n\nWe need to find the hedge ratios that make a long forward position locally value-neutral against infinitesimal changes in $S_t$. This means constructing a portfolio whose delta with respect to $S_t$ is zero. The value of our initial position is $V_t$.\n\n- **Hedging with the underlying asset $S_t$**:\nLet $h_S$ be the number of units of the underlying asset held to hedge the forward position. The total portfolio value is $\\Pi_t = V_t + h_S S_t$. For the portfolio to be delta-neutral, its derivative with respect to $S_t$ must be zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Pi_t}{\\partial S_t} = \\frac{\\partial V_t}{\\partial S_t} + h_S \\frac{\\partial S_t}{\\partial S_t} = \\Delta_S V_t + h_S = 0\n$$\nThe optimal hedge ratio $h_S^*$ is therefore:\n$$\nh_S^* = -\\Delta_S V_t = - \\exp\\left( \\int_t^T (c(u) - q(u)) du \\right)\n$$\nThis is a dynamic hedge, as $h_S^*$ changes with time $t$. To maintain the hedge, one must continuously rebalance the holding in the underlying asset.\n\n- **Hedging with the forward contract itself**:\nLet $h_F$ be the number of units of the same forward contract used for hedging. The total portfolio is composed of the original long position (1 unit) and the hedging position ($h_F$ units), for a total of $(1+h_F)$ units of the forward contract. The portfolio value is $\\Pi'_t = (1+h_F) V_t$. To make the portfolio delta-neutral:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Pi'_t}{\\partial S_t} = (1+h_F) \\frac{\\partial V_t}{\\partial S_t} = (1+h_F) \\Delta_S V_t = 0\n$$\nWe know that $\\Delta_S V_t = \\exp\\left( \\int_t^T (c(u) - q(u)) du \\right)$, which is strictly positive. Therefore, the equation can only be satisfied if:\n$$\n1+h_F = 0 \\implies h_F^* = -1\n$$\nThis means that to hedge a long forward position with the same forward contract, one must take an equal and opposite position (a short position of one unit). This effectively closes out the original position, resulting in a net position of zero. This is a static hedge, requiring no further rebalancing.\n\nThe contrast is clear: hedging with the underlying asset requires a dynamic strategy where the number of shorted units of the asset changes with time, converging to $-1$ as $t \\to T$. Hedging with the forward contract itself is a trivial, static hedge that simply cancels the position.\n\nThe four requested quantities are:\n1. $F_{t,T} = S_t \\exp\\left( \\int_t^T (r(u) - q(u) + c(u)) du \\right)$\n2. $\\Delta_S V_t = \\exp\\left( \\int_t^T (c(u) - q(u)) du \\right)$\n3. $h_S^* = - \\exp\\left( \\int_t^T (c(u) - q(u)) du \\right)$\n4. $h_F^* = -1$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\pmatrix{\nS_t \\exp\\left( \\int_t^T (r(u) - q(u) + c(u)) du \\right) & \\exp\\left( \\int_t^T (c(u) - q(u)) du \\right) & - \\exp\\left( \\int_t^T (c(u) - q(u)) du \\right) & -1\n}\n}\n$$", "id": "3051044"}, {"introduction": "Having mastered linear derivatives, we now move to the non-linear world of options, where delta is no longer constant but changes with the underlying asset's price.

The delta, $\\Delta_t$, represents the number of futures contracts to hold per option to construct a risk-free hedge. The problem defines the delta as the partial derivative of the option price with respect to the futures price, $\\Delta_t = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial F}(t,F_t)$.\n\nFirst, we establish the price of the option, $C(t, F_t)$, using the principle of no-arbitrage in a risk-neutral framework. The value of the option at time $t$ is the discounted expectation of its terminal payoff under the risk-neutral measure $\\mathbb{Q}$, where the numeraire is the money market account $B_t = \\exp(rt)$.\nThe payoff at maturity $T$ is $(F_T - K)^+$. The discount factor from $T$ to $t$ is $\\exp(-r(T-t))$. Thus, the option price is:\n$$ C(t, F_t) = E_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\left[ \\exp(-r(T-t)) (F_T - K)^{+} \\mid \\mathcal{F}_t \\right] $$\nwhere $F_t$ is the futures price at time $t$ and $\\mathcal{F}_t$ is the information available at time $t$. Since the discount factor is deterministic, we can write:\n$$ C(t, F_t) = \\exp(-r(T-t)) E_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\left[ (F_T - K)^{+} \\mid F_t \\right] $$\n\nThe futures price $F_t$ follows the stochastic differential equation (SDE) $dF_t = \\sigma F_t dW_t$, where $W_t$ is a standard Brownian motion under $\\mathbb{Q}$. This is a geometric Brownian motion with zero drift. The solution to this SDE for $F_T$ given $F_t$ is:\n$$ F_T = F_t \\exp\\left( -\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2(T-t) + \\sigma(W_T - W_t) \\right) $$\nUnder the measure $\\mathbb{Q}$, the increment $W_T - W_t$ is a normally distributed random variable with mean $0$ and variance $T-t$. Therefore, $\\ln(F_T)$ is normally distributed with mean $\\mu = \\ln(F_t) - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2(T-t)$ and variance $v^2 = \\sigma^2(T-t)$.\n\nTo calculate the expectation $E_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\left[ (F_T - K)^{+} \\mid F_t \\right]$, we can separate it into two terms:\n$$ E_{\\mathbb{Q}} [ (F_T - K)^{+} \\mid F_t ] = E_{\\mathbb{Q}} [ F_T \\mathbb{I}_{F_T > K} \\mid F_t ] - K \\cdot E_{\\mathbb{Q}} [ \\mathbb{I}_{F_T > K} \\mid F_t ] $$\nwhere $\\mathbb{I}_{F_T > K}$ is an indicator function. The second term is $K \\cdot \\mathbb{Q}(F_T > K \\mid F_t)$. The condition $F_T > K$ is equivalent to $\\ln(F_T) > \\ln(K)$. Standardizing the normal random variable $\\ln(F_T)$, we get:\n$$ \\mathbb{Q}(F_T > K \\mid F_t) = \\mathbb{Q}\\left( \\frac{\\ln(F_T) - \\mu}{v} > \\frac{\\ln(K) - \\mu}{v} \\right) = 1 - \\Phi\\left( \\frac{\\ln(K) - \\mu}{v} \\right) = \\Phi\\left( -\\frac{\\ln(K) - \\mu}{v} \\right) $$\nwhere $\\Phi(\\cdot)$ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.

A standard calculation involving completing the square in the exponent of the integral yields the result:\n$$ E_{\\mathbb{Q}} [ F_T \\mathbb{I}_{F_T > K} \\mid F_t ] = F_t \\Phi(d_1) $$\nwhere $d_1$ is given by:\n$$ d_1 = \\frac{\\ln(F_t/K) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2(T-t)}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T-t}} $$\nNote that $d_1 = d_2 + \\sigma\\sqrt{T-t}$.\n\nCombining these results, we obtain the Black-76 formula for the price of a call option on a futures contract:\n$$ C(t, F) = \\exp(-r(T-t)) \\left[ F \\Phi(d_1) - K \\Phi(d_2) \\right] $$\nwhere we have replaced $F_t$ with the generic variable $F$ for differentiation.\n\nThe delta-hedging strategy consists of holding a quantity $\\Delta_t$ of the underlying futures contract for each option held.

The value of the portfolio at time $t+\\Delta t$ is:\n$$\n\\Pi_{t+\\Delta t} = V(S_{t+\\Delta t}, t+\\Delta t, \\sigma+\\Delta\\sigma) - \\Delta_0 S_{t+\\Delta t}\n$$\nThe problem states that the financing cost of the hedge is negligible, so the profit and loss (P&L) over the interval $[t, t+\\Delta t]$ is the change in the portfolio's value, $\\text{P\\&L} = \\Pi_{t+\\Delta t} - \\Pi_t$.\n$$\n\\text{P\\&L} = \\left( V(S_{t+\\Delta t}, t+\\Delta t, \\sigma+\\Delta\\sigma) - \\Delta_0 S_{t+\\Delta t} \\right) - \\left( V(S_t, t, \\sigma) - \\Delta_0 S_t \\right)\n$$\nRearranging terms, we get:\n$$\n\\text{P\\&L} = \\left( V(S_{t+\\Delta t}, t+\\Delta t, \\sigma+\\Delta\\sigma) - V(S_t, t, \\sigma) \\right) - \\Delta_0 \\left( S_{t+\\Delta t} - S_t \\right)\n$$\nLet $\\Delta V = V(S_{t+\\Delta t}, t+\\Delta t, \\sigma+\\Delta\\sigma) - V(S_t, t, \\sigma)$ and $\\Delta S = S_{t+\\Delta t} - S_t$. The expression for P&L becomes:\n$$\n\\text{P\\&L} = \\Delta V - \\Delta_0 \\Delta S\n$$\nTo find a leading-order approximation for the P&L, we perform a Taylor series expansion of $\\Delta V$ around the point $(S_t, t, \\sigma)$. The function $V$ depends on three variables, so we use a multivariable expansion. We are interested in an expansion that is second-order in $S$ and first-order in $t$ and $\\sigma$.\n$$\n\\Delta V \\approx \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} \\Delta S + \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} \\Delta t + \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\sigma} \\Delta \\sigma + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} (\\Delta S)^2 + \\text{higher-order terms (H.O.T.)}\n$$\nAll partial derivatives are evaluated at $(S_t, t, \\sigma)$.\n\nThe justification for this specific form of expansion comes from the scaling properties of the increments for an Itô process. The underlying asset price follows $\\mathrm{d}S_{u}=\\mu S_{u}\\,\\mathrm{d}u+\\sigma_{S} S_{u}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{u}$. Over a small interval $\\Delta t$, the increments have the following orders of magnitude:\n- $\\Delta t$ is of order $O(\\Delta t)$.\n- The increment of the Brownian motion, $\\Delta W_t = W_{t+\\Delta t} - W_t$, is a random variable with mean $0$ and variance $\\Delta t$, so its magnitude is of order $O(\\sqrt{\\Delta t})$.\n- The asset price change, $\\Delta S \\approx \\mu S_t \\Delta t + \\sigma_S S_t \\Delta W_t$, is dominated by the stochastic term and is thus of order $O(\\sqrt{\\Delta t})$.\n- The squared price change, $(\\Delta S)^2 \\approx (\\sigma_S S_t \\Delta W_t)^2 = \\sigma_S^2 S_t^2 (\\Delta W_t)^2$. In the context of Itô calculus, $(\\mathrm{d}W_t)^2 = \\mathrm{d}t$, which means that $(\\Delta W_t)^2$ has an expected value of $\\Delta t$ and its magnitude is of order $O(\\Delta t)$. Therefore, $(\\Delta S)^2$ is of order $O(\\Delta t)$.\n\nThe higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion that are neglected include:\n- Cross-product terms such as $\\frac{\\partial^2V}{\\partial S \\partial t}\\Delta S \\Delta t$, which is of order $O(\\sqrt{\\Delta t})O(\\Delta t) = O((\\Delta t)^{3/2})$.\n- higher powers like $(\\Delta S)^3 \\sim O((\\Delta t)^{3/2})$ and $(\\Delta t)^2 \\sim O((\\Delta t)^2)$.\n- Terms involving $\\Delta \\sigma$, such as $\\Delta S \\Delta \\sigma$ and $(\\Delta \\sigma)^2$, are also considered higher-order effects in this leading-order approximation.\n\nThese higher-order terms vanish faster than $O(\\Delta t)$ as $\\Delta t \\to 0$. The leading-order approximation must retain all terms of order $O(\\Delta t)$ and the term for the exogenous shock $\\Delta \\sigma$. The crucial insight is that the term $\\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma(\\Delta S)^2$ is of order $O(\\Delta t)$ and must be included.\n\nSubstituting the expansion for $\\Delta V$ back into the P&L equation:\n$$\n\\text{P\\&L} \\approx \\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} \\Delta S + \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} \\Delta t + \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\sigma} \\Delta \\sigma + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} (\\Delta S)^2 \\right) - \\Delta_0 \\Delta S\n$$\nBy definition, the hedge ratio is $\\Delta_0 = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S}$. The first term in the parentheses cancels with the hedging term:\n$$\n\\text{P\\&L} \\approx \\left( \\Delta_0 \\Delta S + \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} \\Delta t + \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\sigma} \\Delta \\sigma + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} (\\Delta S)^2 \\right) - \\Delta_0 \\Delta S\n$$\n$$\n\\text{P\\&L} \\approx \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} \\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} (\\Delta S)^2 + \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\sigma} \\Delta \\sigma\n$$\nUsing the standard notation for the Greeks provided in the problem statement ($\\Theta = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}$, $\\Gamma = \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2}$, $\\nu = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\sigma}$), we arrive at the final expression for the approximate P&L:\n$$\n\\text{P\\&L} \\approx \\Theta \\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2} \\Gamma (\\Delta S)^2 + \\nu \\Delta \\sigma\n$$\n\n**Economic Interpretation of Terms:**\n1.  **$\\Theta \\Delta t$ (Theta P&L):** This term represents the P&L attributable to the passage of time. For a typical long option, $\\Theta$ is negative, reflecting time decay. Thus, holding the hedged portfolio over the interval $\\Delta t$ results in a predictable loss equal to $\\Theta \\Delta t$, assuming all other factors remain constant.\n\n2.  **$\\frac{1}{2} \\Gamma (\\Delta S)^2$ (Gamma P&L):** This term represents the P&L generated by the option's convexity with respect to the underlying price. The delta hedge neutralizes the first-order (linear) price risk, but it does not protect against second-order effects. For a standard long option, Gamma ($\\Gamma$) is positive. This means that the position generates a profit from price movements in either direction, as $(\\Delta S)^2$ is always non-negative. This profit arises because a static delta hedge becomes imperfect as soon as the price moves; the portfolio becomes under-hedged for a price rise and over-hedged for a price fall, with both scenarios creating a profit for a long-gamma position.\n\n3.  **$\\nu \\Delta \\sigma$ (Vega P&L):** This term represents the P&L from the change in the implied volatility parameter, $\\sigma$. The delta hedge provides no protection against changes in volatility. The Greek $\\nu$ (Vega) measures the option price's sensitivity to implied volatility. For a standard long option, $\\nu$ is positive. Therefore, an increase in implied volatility ($\\Delta \\sigma > 0$) leads to a profit, while a decrease leads to a loss. This term isolates the portfolio's exposure to volatility risk.\n\nThese three terms decompose the total P&L of the statically delta-hedged portfolio into contributions from time decay, price convexity (hedging error), and changes in implied volatility.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\Theta \\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2} \\Gamma (\\Delta S)^2 + \\nu \\Delta \\sigma}\n$$", "id": "3051041"}]}
