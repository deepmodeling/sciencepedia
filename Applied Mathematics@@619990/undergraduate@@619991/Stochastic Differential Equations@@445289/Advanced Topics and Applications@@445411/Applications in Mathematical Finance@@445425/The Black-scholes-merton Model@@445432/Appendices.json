{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The Black-Scholes-Merton model is built upon the foundational economic principle of no-arbitrage, which states that no risk-free profit opportunities should exist in an efficient market. This principle gives rise to the famous put-call parity relationship, a static connection between the prices of calls, puts, the underlying asset, and a risk-free bond.

For the same strike $K = 100$ and maturity $T$, you observe the following European option prices at time $0$: a call priced at $C_{0} = 12.50$ and a put priced at $P_{0} = 3.00$.\n\nStarting from first principles of no-arbitrage and replication, construct a static, self-financing arbitrage strategy using the stock, the call, the put, and the risk-free bank account that exploits any violation of the fundamental replication relation between these instruments.

Round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires constructing a static arbitrage strategy based on a potential violation of the put-call parity relationship and calculating the guaranteed profit at maturity. The analysis proceeds from the first principles of no-arbitrage and replication.\n\nThe fundamental put-call parity relationship for European options on a non-dividend-paying stock is derived by constructing two portfolios with identical payoffs at maturity $T$. Under the no-arbitrage assumption, these portfolios must have the same price at time $t=0$. The relationship is given by:\n$$C_{0} + K e^{-rT} = P_{0} + S_{0}$$\nwhere $C_0$ is the price of the call option at time $0$, $P_0$ is the price of the put option at time $0$, $S_0$ is the stock price at time $0$, $K$ is the strike price, $r$ is the continuously compounded risk-free rate, and $T$ is the time to maturity.\n\nThe left-hand side, $C_{0} + K e^{-rT}$, represents the cost of a portfolio comprising one long call option and an amount of cash equal to $K e^{-rT}$ invested at the risk-free rate (i.e., a long position in a zero-coupon bond with face value $K$). The right-hand side, $P_{0} + S_{0}$, represents the cost of a portfolio comprising one long put option and one long share of the stock. At maturity $T$, both portfolios have a guaranteed payoff of $\\max(S_T, K)$, where $S_T$ is the stock price at time $T$.\n\nFirst, we must verify if the given market prices violate this parity relationship. The provided data are:\n- Stock price: $S_{0} = 105$\n- Strike price: $K = 100$\n- Risk-free rate: $r = 0.03$\n- Time to maturity: $T = 1$\n- Call price: $C_{0} = 12.50$\n- Put price: $P_{0} = 3.00$\n\nLet us calculate the value of both sides of the parity equation.\nValue of the left-hand side (LHS):\n$$LHS = C_{0} + K e^{-rT} = 12.50 + 100 \\times \\exp(-0.03 \\times 1)$$\n$$LHS = 12.50 + 100 \\times \\exp(-0.03) \\approx 12.50 + 100 \\times 0.97044553 = 12.50 + 97.044553 = 109.544553$$\n\nValue of the right-hand side (RHS):\n$$RHS = P_{0} + S_{0} = 3.00 + 105 = 108.00$$\n\nComparing the two sides, we find that $109.544553 > 108.00$. Therefore, put-call parity is violated:\n$$C_{0} + K e^{-rT} > P_{0} + S_{0}$$\nThis inequality signifies an arbitrage opportunity. The portfolio consisting of a call option and a risk-free bond is overpriced relative to the portfolio consisting of a put option and the stock.\n\nThe arbitrage strategy is to sell the overpriced portfolio and buy the underpriced one. However, a clearer construction involves creating a synthetic risk-free asset. Consider a portfolio constructed at time $t=0$ consisting of one long put option, one long share of stock, and one short call option.\nThe cost of establishing this portfolio at $t=0$ is:\n$$\\text{Cost}_{0} = P_{0} + S_{0} - C_{0} = 3.00 + 105.00 - 12.50 = 95.50$$\nThe payoff of this portfolio at maturity $T$ is:\n$$\\text{Payoff}_{T} = (\\text{Payoff from put}) + (\\text{Payoff from stock}) - (\\text{Payoff from call})$$\n$$\\text{Payoff}_{T} = \\max(K - S_{T}, 0) + S_{T} - \\max(S_{T} - K, 0)$$\nWe analyze this payoff for the two possible scenarios at maturity:\n1. If $S_{T} > K$: Payoff$_{T} = 0 + S_{T} - (S_{T} - K) = K = 100$.\n2. If $S_{T} \\leq K$: Payoff$_{T} = (K - S_{T}) + S_{T} - 0 = K = 100$.\nThe portfolio has a certain, risk-free payoff of $K = 100$ at time $T$. It is a synthetic zero-coupon bond with a face value of $K$.\n\nThe fair price of such a bond at time $t=0$ should be its discounted future value, which is $K e^{-rT} = 100 \\times \\exp(-0.03) \\approx 97.044553$.\nThe market price of creating this synthetic bond is $\\text{Cost}_{0} = 95.50$. Since the market price ($95.50$) is less than the fair value ($\\approx 97.05$), the synthetic bond is underpriced.\n\nThe arbitrage strategy is to buy the underpriced synthetic bond and finance it by selling (shorting) the fairly priced equivalent, which is borrowing at the risk-free rate.\n\nThe explicit trades at time $t=0$ are:\n1.  **Buy one European put option**: Cash outflow of $P_{0} = 3.00$.\n2.  **Buy one share of stock**: Cash outflow of $S_{0} = 105.00$.\n3.  **Sell (write) one European call option**: Cash inflow of $C_{0} = 12.50$.\nThis set of trades requires a net cash payment of $3.00 + 105.00 - 12.50 = 95.50$.\n4.  **Finance this payment by borrowing**: Borrow the amount $95.50$ from the risk-free bank account. This is a cash inflow of $95.50$.\n\nThe total net cash flow at time $t=0$ is $0$, so the strategy is self-financing.\n\nAt maturity $T=1$, the positions are closed:\n1.  The portfolio (long put, long stock, short call) yields a guaranteed cash inflow of $K = 100.00$.\n2.  The amount borrowed, $95.50$, must be repaid with interest. The repayment amount is $95.50 \\times e^{rT} = 95.50 \\times \\exp(0.03 \\times 1)$.\n\nThe guaranteed arbitrage profit at time $T$ is the difference between the cash inflow from the asset portfolio and the cash outflow for the loan repayment.\n$$\\text{Profit}_{T} = K - (P_{0} + S_{0} - C_{0}) e^{rT}$$\n$$\\text{Profit}_{T} = 100 - (95.50) \\times \\exp(0.03)$$\nUsing a calculator for the values:\n$$\\exp(0.03) \\approx 1.03045453$$\n$$\\text{Loan Repayment} \\approx 95.50 \\times 1.03045453 \\approx 98.408408$$\n$$\\text{Profit}_{T} \\approx 100 - 98.408408 = 1.591592$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$\\text{Profit}_{T} \\approx 1.592$$\nThis value represents the risk-free profit guaranteed at maturity by exploiting the mispricing in the options market.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.592}$$", "id": "3079682"}, {"introduction": "Beyond pricing, the true power of the BSM model lies in risk management through dynamic hedging.

We can write $W_T - W_t = \\sqrt{T-t} Z$, where $Z$ is a standard normal random variable, $Z \\sim N(0,1)$. Let $\\tau = T-t$. The expression for $S_T$ becomes\n$$ S_T = S \\exp\\left(\\left(r - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)\\tau + \\sigma\\sqrt{\\tau}Z\\right) $$\nLet us define a random variable $X = \\exp\\left(\\left(r - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)\\tau + \\sigma\\sqrt{\\tau}Z\\right)$.

The term in the parentheses in the expression for $\\Delta$ is zero.\nThis gives the well-known result for the delta of a European call:\n$$\n\\Delta = N(d_1)\n$$\nWe are asked to assess the approximation $\\Delta \\approx p$, which is equivalent to assessing $N(d_1) \\approx N(d_2)$.\nThe relationship between the arguments is $d_1 = d_2 + \\sigma\\sqrt{T}$. The difference is $d_1 - d_2 = \\sigma\\sqrt{T}$. Since $\\sigma0$ and $T0$, this difference is always positive.\n\nThe quality of the approximation $N(d_1) \\approx N(d_2)$ depends on two factors:\n1. The magnitude of the difference between the arguments, $\\sigma\\sqrt{T}$. If $\\sigma\\sqrt{T}$ is very small (i.e., volatility or time to maturity is small), then $d_1 \\approx d_2$, and hence $N(d_1) \\approx N(d_2)$ for any value of $d_2$.\n2. The location of the arguments on the real line, which is determined by moneyness ($S_0/K$) and other parameters. The function $N(x)$ is a sigmoid function. Its derivative, the standard normal PDF $N'(x)$, is maximal at $x=0$ and approaches zero as $|x| \\to \\infty$. By the Mean Value Theorem, $N(d_1) - N(d_2) = N(d_2 + \\sigma\\sqrt{T}) - N(d_2) = N'(c) \\cdot \\sigma\\sqrt{T}$ for some $c \\in (d_2, d_1)$.\n   - The approximation is good if the difference $N(d_1) - N(d_2)$ is small. This occurs when either $\\sigma\\sqrt{T}$ is small, or $N'(c)$ is small.\n   - $N'(c)$ is small when $|c|$ is large. This happens when both $|d_1|$ and $|d_2|$ are large.\n     - For a deep in-the-money option ($S_0 \\gg K$), $\\ln(S_0/K)$ is large and positive, making $d_1$ and $d_2$ large and positive. In this case, $N(d_1) \\approx 1$ and $N(d_2) \\approx 1$.\n     - For a deep out-of-the-money option ($S_0 \\ll K$), $\\ln(S_0/K)$ is large and negative, making $d_1$ and $d_2$ large and negative. In this case, $N(d_1) \\approx 0$ and $N(d_2) \\approx 0$.\n     - In both deep in-the-money and deep out-of-the-money cases, the approximation is good because the CDF is very flat in the tails.\n   - The approximation is poor when $N(d_1) - N(d_2)$ is large. This occurs when $N'(c)$ is large (i.e., $c$ is close to $0$) and $\\sigma\\sqrt{T}$ is large. $d_1$ and $d_2$ are close to $0$ for at-the-money options ($S_0 \\approx K$), especially if the drift term $(r - \\sigma^2/2)T$ is small. In this region, the CDF is steepest, so a given difference $\\sigma\\sqrt{T}$ in the argument results in the largest possible difference in the function values.\n\nSummary of analysis:\n- The approximation is good when $\\sigma\\sqrt{T}$ is small.\n- The approximation is good for deep in-the-money and deep out-of-the-money options (where $|d_1|,|d_2|$ are large).\n- The approximation is poor for near-at-the-money options when $\\sigma\\sqrt{T}$ is large.\n\nNow, we evaluate the provided options:\n\nA. The approximation $N(d_1) \\approx N(d_2)$ is good when either $\\sigma \\sqrt{T}$ is small or the option is deep in-the-money or deep out-of-the-money; it is poor near at-the-money when $\\sigma \\sqrt{T}$ is large.\nThis statement is a perfect match for our derived conclusions. It correctly identifies all conditions affecting the approximation quality. **Correct**.\n\nB. The approximation is good when the risk-free rate $r$ is high and poor when $r$ is near zero, regardless of $\\sigma \\sqrt{T}$ and moneyness.\nThe difference $d_1 - d_2 = \\sigma\\sqrt{T}$ is independent of $r$. While $r$ affects the values of $d_1$ and $d_2$, it is not the primary determinant of the approximation's quality. The claim \"regardless of $\\sigma \\sqrt{T}$\" is fundamentally false. **Incorrect**.\n\nC. The approximation is uniformly accurate for all maturities because $d_1 - d_2 = 0$ under the model.\nThe premise $d_1 - d_2 = 0$ is false. We derived $d_1 - d_2 = \\sigma\\sqrt{T}$, which is strictly positive. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. The approximation is best for far out-of-the-money options but systematically breaks down for deep in-the-money options due to the nonlinearity of the normal cumulative distribution function, independent of $\\sigma \\sqrt{T}$.\nThis statement is asymmetric without justification. The approximation is good at both tails (deep OTM and deep ITM). Also, the claim that it is independent of $\\sigma\\sqrt{T}$ is false. **Incorrect**.\n\nThus, option A provides the correct and complete characterization of the approximation quality.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2438257"}]}
