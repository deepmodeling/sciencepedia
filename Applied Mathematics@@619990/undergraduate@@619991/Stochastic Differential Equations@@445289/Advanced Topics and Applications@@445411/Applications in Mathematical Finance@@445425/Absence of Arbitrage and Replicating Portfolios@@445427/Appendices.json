There is a risky asset with current price $S_0$ that, at the next time step, takes one of two values: $S_0 u$ in the up state or $S_0 d$ in the down state, where $u0$ and $d0$.

The parameters are realistic.\n- The problem is non-trivial and tests core understanding.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nA self-financing portfolio is described by $(\\phi, \\psi)$, where $\\phi$ is the number of shares of the risky asset and $\\psi$ is the number of units of the risk-free money market account. The initial value of the portfolio is $V_0 = \\phi S_0 + \\psi B_0$. Since $B_0=1$, this is $V_0 = \\phi S_0 + \\psi$. The terminal value is $V_1 = \\phi S_1 + \\psi B_1 = \\phi S_1 + \\psi (1+r)$.\n\nAn arbitrage is a self-financing portfolio that satisfies three conditions:\n1.  The initial cost is zero: $V_0 = \\phi S_0 + \\psi = 0$.\n2.  The terminal payoff is non-negative in all states: $V_1 \\ge 0$.\n3.  The terminal payoff is strictly positive in at least one state.\n\nFrom the zero-cost condition, we can express the holding in the risk-free asset in terms of the holding in the risky asset: $\\psi = -\\phi S_0$. This means the strategy consists of taking a position of $\\phi$ shares in the stock, financed by taking an opposite position of value $\\phi S_0$ in the money market account.\n\nSubstituting $\\psi$ into the expression for the terminal value, we get:\n$V_1 = \\phi S_1 + (-\\phi S_0)(1+r) = \\phi (S_1 - S_0(1+r))$.\n\nThe terminal value $V_1$ depends on the state of the market. Let's denote the payoffs in the up and down states as $V_{1,u}$ and $V_{1,d}$ respectively.\n- In the up state, $S_1 = S_0 u$, so the payoff is $V_{1,u} = \\phi (S_0 u - S_0(1+r)) = \\phi S_0 (u - (1+r))$.\n- In the down state, $S_1 = S_0 d$, so the payoff is $V_{1,d} = \\phi (S_0 d - S_0(1+r)) = \\phi S_0 (d - (1+r))$.\n\nFor an arbitrage to exist, we must have $V_{1,u} \\ge 0$, $V_{1,d} \\ge 0$, and at least one of these must be a strict inequality. Let's consider two cases for $\\phi$.\n\nCase 1: $\\phi  0$ (long position in the stock, short in the bond).\nSince $\\phi S_0  0$, the arbitrage conditions become:\n- $u - (1+r) \\ge 0 \\implies u \\ge 1+r$.\n- $d - (1+r) \\ge 0 \\implies d \\ge 1+r$.\n- At least one strict inequality must hold. Since it is standard to assume $u  d$ for a non-trivial model, if $d \\ge 1+r$, then $u  d \\ge 1+r$, which implies $u  1+r$. In this case, $V_{1,u}  0$ and $V_{1,d} \\ge 0$. Thus, an arbitrage opportunity exists if $d \\ge 1+r$. This strategy involves borrowing money to buy the stock, as the stock's growth in both scenarios is at least as good as the interest on the loan.\n\nCase 2: $\\phi  0$ (short position in the stock, long in the bond).\nSince $\\phi S_0  0$, the signs of the inequalities are reversed for the arbitrage conditions:\n- $u - (1+r) \\le 0 \\implies u \\le 1+r$.\n- $d - (1+r) \\le 0 \\implies d \\le 1+r$.\n- At least one strict inequality must hold. Since $u  d$, if $u \\le 1+r$, then $d  u \\le 1+r$, which implies $d  1+r$. In this case, $V_{1,d}  0$ and $V_{1,u} \\ge 0$. Thus, an arbitrage opportunity exists if $u \\le 1+r$. This strategy involves short-selling the stock and investing the proceeds in the risk-free asset, as the risk-free return is at least as good as the stock's growth in both scenarios.\n\nTo preclude any arbitrage opportunity, both of these cases must be prevented.\n- To prevent arbitrage from Case 1, we must have the opposite of its condition, i.e., $d  1+r$.\n- To prevent arbitrage from Case 2, we must have the opposite of its condition, i.e., $u  1+r$.\n\nCombining these, the necessary condition for the absence of arbitrage is $d  1+r  u$. This ensures that the risk-free return lies strictly between the returns of the risky asset in the down and up states.\n\nNow, we analyze the specific parameter values: $S_0=80$, $u=1.05$, $d=1.03$, and $r=0.02$.\nThe risk-free growth factor is $1+r = 1+0.02 = 1.02$.\nWe check the no-arbitrage condition: $d  1+r  u$.\nSubstituting the values: $1.03  1.02  1.05$.\nThis statement is false because $1.03$ is not less than $1.02$. Specifically, we have $d=1.03  1+r=1.02$.\nTherefore, the market violates the no-arbitrage condition. The violation corresponds to Case 1, where $d \\ge 1+r$, indicating an arbitrage opportunity by taking a long position in the stock financed by borrowing.\n\nWe now construct an explicit arbitrage strategy. Let's choose to buy $\\phi=1$ share of the stock.\n- The cost to buy the stock is $\\phi S_0 = 1 \\times 80 = 80$.\n- To create a zero-cost portfolio, we must borrow this amount. This corresponds to setting our holding in the money market account to $\\psi = -80$.\n- The initial value of this portfolio is $V_0 = \\phi S_0 + \\psi B_0 = (1)(80) + (-80)(1) = 0$.\n\nNext, we compute the terminal payoffs for this strategy. The terminal obligation on the loan is $\\psi B_1 = -80 \\times (1+0.02) = -80 \\times 1.02 = -81.6$. The portfolio's terminal value is $V_1 = \\phi S_1 - 81.6 = S_1 - 81.6$.\n- In the up state, the stock price becomes $S_{1,u} = S_0 u = 80 \\times 1.05 = 84$.\nThe terminal payoff is $V_{1,u} = 84 - 81.6 = 2.4$.\n- In the down state, the stock price becomes $S_{1,d} = S_0 d = 80 \\times 1.03 = 82.4$.\nThe terminal payoff is $V_{1,d} = 82.4 - 81.6 = 0.8$.\n\nThe strategy yields a profit of $2.4$ in the up state and $0.8$ in the down state, with zero initial investment. Both payoffs are strictly positive, confirming this is an arbitrage.\n\nThe final question is to find the minimum guaranteed profit per share.\nThe profit of the strategy per share held is given by $\\frac{V_1}{\\phi}$.\n- Profit per share in up state: $\\frac{V_{1,u}}{\\phi} = \\frac{\\phi S_0 (u - (1+r))}{\\phi} = S_0 (u - (1+r)) = 80(1.05-1.02) = 80(0.03) = 2.4$.\n- Profit per share in down state: $\\frac{V_{1,d}}{\\phi} = \\frac{\\phi S_0 (d - (1+r))}{\\phi} = S_0 (d - (1+r)) = 80(1.03-1.02) = 80(0.01) = 0.8$.\n\nThe minimum guaranteed profit per share is the minimum of these two values.\nMinimum guaranteed profit per share $= \\min(2.4, 0.8) = 0.8$.\nThis value is independent of the number of shares $\\phi$ chosen for the arbitrage portfolio (as long as $\\phi0$).\nThe final answer is expressed in currency units, so it is $0.8$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8}$$", "id": "3038414"}, {"introduction": "Moving from a discrete model to the continuous-time world of Black-Scholes, we introduce a more powerful and general pricing tool: the state-price deflator, also known as the stochastic discount factor.

A process is a martingale if and only if its drift term is zero.\n\nLet us model the dynamics of the state-price deflator $M_t$ by a general stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the form:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}M_t = a_t M_t \\mathrm{d}t + b_t M_t \\mathrm{d}W_t\n$$\nwhere $a_t$ and $b_t$ are adapted processes to be determined.

This confirms our previous identification.\n\nThe relationship between the state-price deflator $M_t$ and the density process $Z_t$ is given by $M_t = B_t^{-1} Z_t$. This can be shown as follows: for any traded asset price process $P_t$, the discounted price $B_t^{-1}P_t$ is a $\\mathbb{Q}$-martingale. By the abstract Bayes' rule, this means $Z_t (B_t^{-1} P_t)$ is a $\\mathbb{P}$-martingale. Rearranging gives $(Z_t B_t^{-1}) P_t$ is a $\\mathbb{P}$-martingale. Comparing this with the definition of the state-price deflator, which states that $M_t P_t$ is a $\\mathbb{P}$-martingale, we deduce $M_t = Z_t B_t^{-1}$.\n\nWe can now write the explicit form of $M_t$ using this relation.

We want to minimize:\n$$\nJ(\\phi) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[\\left(\\tilde{H} - \\int_{0}^{T} \\phi_{t}\\, d\\tilde{S}_{t}\\right)^{2}\\right]\n$$\nThis is a least-squares problem in the Hilbert space $L^{2}(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}_{T}, \\mathbb{Q})$. The solution is found by making the hedging error, $\\tilde{H} - \\int_{0}^{T} \\phi_{t}\\, d\\tilde{S}_{t}$, orthogonal to the space of all possible stochastic integrals with respect to $\\tilde{S}_{t}$.\n\nA more direct approach is to use the martingale representation theorem (specifically the Galtchouk-Kunita-Watanabe decomposition). Any square-integrable martingale can be represented as a stochastic integral with respect to the underlying Brownian motions.\nThe discounted claim $\\tilde{H} = \\alpha W^{(1)}_{T} + \\beta W^{(2)}_{T}$ can be written as the terminal value of a martingale. Since $W_{T} = \\int_{0}^{T} dW_t$ for any Brownian motion, we have:\n$$\n\\tilde{H} = \\alpha \\int_{0}^{T} 1 \\cdot dW^{(1)}_{t} + \\beta \\int_{0}^{T} 1 \\cdot dW^{(2)}_{t} = \\int_{0}^{T} \\alpha\\, dW^{(1)}_{t} + \\int_{0}^{T} \\beta\\, dW^{(2)}_{t}\n$$\nThe value of the hedging portfolio is given by:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} \\phi_{t}\\, d\\tilde{S}_{t} = \\int_{0}^{T} \\phi_{t} (\\sigma_{1}\\, dW^{(1)}_{t} + \\sigma_{2}\\, dW^{(2)}_{t}) = \\int_{0}^{T} \\phi_{t}\\sigma_{1}\\, dW^{(1)}_{t} + \\int_{0}^{T} \\phi_{t}\\sigma_{2}\\, dW^{(2)}_{t}\n$$\nThe hedging error is the difference between these two quantities:\n$$\n\\text{Error} = \\tilde{H} - \\int_{0}^{T} \\phi_{t}\\, d\\tilde{S}_{t} = \\int_{0}^{T} (\\alpha - \\phi_{t}\\sigma_{1})\\, dW^{(1)}_{t} + \\int_{0}^{T} (\\beta - \\phi_{t}\\sigma_{2})\\, dW^{(2)}_{t}\n$$\nWe need to minimize the expectation of the square of this error. Because $W^{(1)}$ and $W^{(2)}$ are independent standard Brownian motions, the stochastic integrals with respect to them are orthogonal. Using the Itô isometry property, which states that $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\int_{0}^{T} f_t dW_t\\right)^2\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T} f_t^2 dt\\right]$, the mean-square error is:\n$$\nJ(\\phi) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[\\left(\\int_{0}^{T} (\\alpha - \\phi_{t}\\sigma_{1})\\, dW^{(1)}_{t}\\right)^2\\right] + \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[\\left(\\int_{0}^{T} (\\beta - \\phi_{t}\\sigma_{2})\\, dW^{(2)}_{t}\\right)^2\\right]\n$$\n$$\nJ(\\phi) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T} (\\alpha - \\phi_{t}\\sigma_{1})^2\\, dt\\right] + \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T} (\\beta - \\phi_{t}\\sigma_{2})^2\\, dt\\right]\n$$\nBy Fubini's theorem, we can swap the expectation and integral:\n$$\nJ(\\phi) = \\int_{0}^{T} \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[ (\\alpha - \\phi_{t}\\sigma_{1})^2 + (\\beta - \\phi_{t}\\sigma_{2})^2 \\right]\\, dt\n$$\nTo minimize this integral, we can minimize the integrand for each $t \\in [0, T]$. Since $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\sigma_{1}$, and $\\sigma_{2}$ are constants, we look for a constant strategy $\\phi_{t} = \\phi$. The problem reduces to minimizing the following function of $\\phi$:\n$$\nf(\\phi) = (\\alpha - \\phi\\sigma_{1})^2 + (\\beta - \\phi\\sigma_{2})^2\n$$\nTo find the minimum, we compute the derivative of $f(\\phi)$ with respect to $\\phi$ and set it to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{d\\phi} = 2(\\alpha - \\phi\\sigma_{1})(-\\sigma_{1}) + 2(\\beta - \\phi\\sigma_{2})(-\\sigma_{2}) = 0\n$$\n$$\n-\\alpha\\sigma_{1} + \\phi\\sigma_{1}^2 - \\beta\\sigma_{2} + \\phi\\sigma_{2}^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\phi(\\sigma_{1}^2 + \\sigma_{2}^2) = \\alpha\\sigma_{1} + \\beta\\sigma_{2}\n$$\nSolving for $\\phi$, we get:\n$$\n\\phi = \\frac{\\alpha\\sigma_{1} + \\beta\\sigma_{2}}{\\sigma_{1}^2 + \\sigma_{2}^2}\n$$\nThe second derivative, $\\frac{d^2f}{d\\phi^2} = 2\\sigma_{1}^2 + 2\\sigma_{2}^2$, is positive since $\\sigma_{1}$ and $\\sigma_{2}$ are positive, confirming that this value of $\\phi$ corresponds to a minimum.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $\\sigma_{1} = 3$, $\\sigma_{2} = 1$, $\\alpha = 1$, and $\\beta = 2$.\n$$\n\\phi = \\frac{(1)(3) + (2)(1)}{(3)^2 + (1)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\phi = \\frac{3 + 2}{9 + 1}\n$$\n$$\n\\phi = \\frac{5}{10}\n$$\n$$\n\\phi = 0.5\n$$\nThe minimal-variance hedging strategy is to hold a constant number of units $\\phi_{t} = 0.5$ of the risky asset.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5}\n$$", "id": "3038453"}]}
