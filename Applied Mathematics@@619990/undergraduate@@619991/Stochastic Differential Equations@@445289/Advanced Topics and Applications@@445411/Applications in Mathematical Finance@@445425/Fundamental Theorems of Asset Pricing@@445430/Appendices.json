It is a well-posed, scientifically sound, and standard problem in quantitative finance. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the construction of an Equivalent Martingale Measure (EMM) $\\mathbb{Q}$ and the verification that the discounted asset price process $\\tilde{S}_t$ is a martingale under $\\mathbb{Q}$. The final goal is to provide the expression for the Radon–Nikodym derivative density $d\\mathbb{Q}/d\\mathbb{P}$ on $\\mathcal{F}_T$.\n\nFirst, we determine the dynamics of the discounted asset price $\\tilde{S}_t = S_t/B_t = S_t \\exp(-rt)$. We apply Itō's lemma for a function $f(t, x) = x \\exp(-rt)$, where $x$ is the process $S_t$. The partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} = -r S_t \\exp(-rt) = -r \\tilde{S}_t, \\quad  \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial S_t} = \\exp(-rt), \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial S_t^2} = 0.\n$$\nThe dynamics of $S_t$ are given by $dS_t = \\mu S_t dt + \\sigma S_t dW_t$. The quadratic variation is $(dS_t)^2 = \\sigma^2 S_t^2 dt$.\nApplying Itō's formula to $d\\tilde{S}_t = df(t, S_t)$:\n$$\nd\\tilde{S}_t = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} dt + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial S_t} dS_t + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial S_t^2} (dS_t)^2\n$$\n$$\nd\\tilde{S}_t = (-r \\tilde{S}_t) dt + \\exp(-rt) (\\mu S_t dt + \\sigma S_t dW_t) + 0\n$$\nSubstituting $\\tilde{S}_t = S_t \\exp(-rt)$:\n$$\nd\\tilde{S}_t = -r \\tilde{S}_t dt + \\mu \\tilde{S}_t dt + \\sigma \\tilde{S}_t dW_t\n$$\n$$\nd\\tilde{S}_t = \\tilde{S}_t \\big( (\\mu - r) dt + \\sigma dW_t \\big)\n$$\nThis is the stochastic differential equation (SDE) for the discounted asset price process under the physical measure $\\mathbb{P}$.\n\nNext, we construct the EMM $\\mathbb{Q}$. We are given the market price of risk, $\\lambda = (\\mu-r)/\\sigma$. Girsanov's theorem provides a way to change the probability measure such that the drift of the Brownian motion is altered. We define a new process $Z_t$ which will serve as the density process for the change of measure. This process must be a martingale. As guided by the problem, we use an exponential local martingale related to the market price of risk. We define the process $\\theta_t = -\\lambda$. Let $L_t = \\int_0^t \\theta_s dW_s = -\\lambda W_t$. The process $Z_t$ is the stochastic exponential of $L_t$, denoted $\\mathcal{E}(L)_t$:\n$$\nZ_t = \\mathcal{E}(-\\lambda W)_t = \\exp\\left( -\\lambda W_t - \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^t \\lambda^2 ds \\right) = \\exp\\left( -\\lambda W_t - \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda^2 t \\right)\n$$\nSince $\\lambda$ is a constant, the process $\\theta_t = -\\lambda$ satisfies Novikov's condition:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P}}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^T \\theta_t^2 dt\\right)\\right] = \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P}}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^T \\lambda^2 dt\\right)\\right] = \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P}}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda^2 T\\right)\\right] = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda^2 T\\right) < \\infty\n$$\nThis condition being satisfied ensures that $Z = (Z_t)_{t\\in[0,T]}$ is not just a local martingale but a true martingale under $\\mathbb{P}$. We can now define the measure $\\mathbb{Q}$ on $\\mathcal{F}_T$ by its Radon-Nikodym derivative with respect to $\\mathbb{P}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbb{Q}}{d\\mathbb{P}}\\bigg|_{\\mathcal{F}_T} = Z_T = \\exp\\left( -\\lambda W_T - \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda^2 T \\right)\n$$\nBy Girsanov's theorem, the process $W^\\mathbb{Q} = (W^\\mathbb{Q}_t)_{t\\in[0,T]}$ defined by\n$$\nW^\\mathbb{Q}_t = W_t - \\int_0^t \\theta_s ds = W_t - \\int_0^t (-\\lambda) ds = W_t + \\lambda t\n$$\nis a standard Brownian motion under the measure $\\mathbb{Q}$. From this, we have the relationship $dW_t = dW^\\mathbb{Q}_t - \\lambda dt$.\n\nNow we find the dynamics of $\\tilde{S}_t$ under $\\mathbb{Q}$ by substituting the expression for $dW_t$ into the SDE for $\\tilde{S}_t$ under $\\mathbb{P}$:\n$$\nd\\tilde{S}_t = \\tilde{S}_t \\big( (\\mu - r) dt + \\sigma(dW^\\mathbb{Q}_t - \\lambda dt) \\big)\n$$\n$$\nd\\tilde{S}_t = \\tilde{S}_t \\big( (\\mu - r - \\sigma\\lambda) dt + \\sigma dW^\\mathbb{Q}_t \\big)\n$$\nWe substitute the definition of the market price of risk, $\\lambda = (\\mu - r)/\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\mu - r - \\sigma\\lambda = \\mu - r - \\sigma \\left(\\frac{\\mu - r}{\\sigma}\\right) = (\\mu - r) - (\\mu - r) = 0\n$$\nThus, the drift term of the SDE for $\\tilde{S}_t$ under $\\mathbb{Q}$ vanishes:\n$$\nd\\tilde{S}_t = \\tilde{S}_t ( (0) dt + \\sigma dW^\\mathbb{Q}_t ) = \\sigma \\tilde{S}_t dW^\\mathbb{Q}_t\n$$\nThis is the SDE for $\\tilde{S}_t$ under $\\mathbb{Q}$. A process whose SDE has a zero drift term is a local martingale. Since the solution to this SDE, a geometric Brownian motion, is non-negative, it is a supermartingale. The explicit solution is $\\tilde{S}_t = \\tilde{S}_0 \\exp(\\sigma W^\\mathbb{Q}_t - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 t)$. We can check the martingale property directly:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}[\\tilde{S}_T|\\mathcal{F}_t] = \\tilde{S}_t \\, \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\sigma(W^\\mathbb{Q}_T - W^\\mathbb{Q}_t) - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 (T-t)\\right)\\bigg|\\mathcal{F}_t\\right]\n$$\nThe increment $W^\\mathbb{Q}_T - W^\\mathbb{Q}_t$ is independent of $\\mathcal{F}_t$ and is normally distributed with mean $0$ and variance $T-t$. The expectation of the log-normal variable is $1$, so $\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}[\\tilde{S}_T|\\mathcal{F}_t] = \\tilde{S}_t$.\nTherefore, $\\tilde{S}$ is a martingale under $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the explicit closed-form expression for the Radon–Nikodym derivative $d\\mathbb{Q}/d\\mathbb{P}$ on $\\mathcal{F}_T$. This is the value of the density martingale $Z_t$ at time $t=T$.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbb{Q}}{d\\mathbb{P}}\\bigg|_{\\mathcal{F}_T} = Z_T = \\exp\\left( -\\lambda W_T - \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda^2 T \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $\\lambda = (\\mu-r)/\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbb{Q}}{d\\mathbb{P}}\\bigg|_{\\mathcal{F}_T} = \\exp\\left( - \\frac{\\mu-r}{\\sigma} W_T - \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\mu-r}{\\sigma}\\right)^2 T \\right)\n$$\nThis is the final expression required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mu-r}{\\sigma}W_T - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\mu-r}{\\sigma}\\right)^2 T\\right)}$$", "id": "3055812"}, {"introduction": "Once we establish a risk-neutral framework, the pricing of contingent claims becomes an exercise in calculating expected values.

Analyze the resulting expression to determine the conditions under which it is finite.\n\n**Step 1: Solve the SDE for $S_t$**\n\nThe given SDE describes a Geometric Brownian Motion. To solve it, we apply Itô's lemma to the function $f(s) = \\ln(s)$. The partial derivatives of $f(s)$ are $f'(s) = 1/s$ and $f''(s) = -1/s^2$. According to Itô's lemma, the differential for $Y_t = \\ln(S_t)$ is:\n$$\ndY_t = d(\\ln S_t) = f'(S_t) dS_t + \\frac{1}{2} f''(S_t) (dS_t)^2\n$$\nFrom the SDE, the quadratic variation term is $(dS_t)^2 = (r S_t dt + \\sigma S_t dW_t)^2$.

Since $S_0 > 0$ and all parameters are finite real numbers, these terms are also always finite.\nTherefore, the expectation is finite for all values of the parameters in their specified domains. No additional conditions are necessary.\nThe conditions under which the expectation is finite are simply the conditions given in the problem statement: $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $r \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $\\sigma \\ge 0$, $T > 0$, and $S_0 > 0$.\nThe problem requires a single closed-form analytic expression for the present value as the final answer.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{S_0^{\\alpha} \\exp\\left( (\\alpha-1)rT + \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha(\\alpha-1)\\sigma^2 T \\right)}\n$$", "id": "3055829"}, {"introduction": "While complete markets guarantee a unique arbitrage-free price, many real-world markets are incomplete, meaning some risks cannot be perfectly hedged.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Detailed Solution\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of prices of a contingent claim under two specific Equivalent Martingale Measures (EMMs), and for the superhedging bounds, which represent the tightest possible range of arbitrage-free prices in this incomplete market.\n\nFirst, let's determine the general form of the price of the contingent claim, $H=\\mathbf{1}_{\\{Y_{1}\\geq 0\\}}$, under an arbitrary EMM, $Q$, from the specified family. The price at time $t=0$ is given by the risk-neutral valuation formula:\n$$\np_{Q} = \\exp(-rT)\\,\\mathbb{E}_{Q}[H]\n$$\nThe payoff $H$ depends on the value of $Y_{1}$. Let's analyze the process $Y_{t}$. Given $a=0$, $b=1$, and $Y_{0}=0$, the dynamics are $dY_{t} = dW^{2}_{t}$, which implies $Y_{t} = W^{2}_{t}$. Therefore, the payoff is $H = \\mathbf{1}_{\\{W^{2}_{1}\\geq 0\\}}$. The price is:\n$$\np_{Q} = \\exp(-rT)\\,\\mathbb{E}_{Q}[\\mathbf{1}_{\\{W^{2}_{1}\\geq 0\\}}] = \\exp(-rT)\\,Q(W^{2}_{1} \\geq 0)\n$$\nThe problem states that under an EMM $Q$ parameterized by $(\\lambda_{1}, \\lambda_{2})$, the relationship between the physical Brownian motion $W^{2}_{t}$ and the $Q$-Brownian motion $W^{2,Q}_{t}$ is given by $dW^{2}_{t}=dW^{2,Q}_{t}-\\lambda_{2}\\,dt$. Integrating this from $t=0$ to $t=1$, and using $W^{2}_{0}=W^{2,Q}_{0}=0$, we get:\n$$\nW^{2}_{1} = W^{2,Q}_{1} - \\lambda_{2}\n$$\nUnder the measure $Q$, the process $W^{2,Q}_{t}$ is a standard Brownian motion. Thus, $W^{2,Q}_{1}$ is a standard normal random variable, $W^{2,Q}_{1} \\sim N(0, 1)$. Consequently, under $Q$, the random variable $W^{2}_{1}$ is normally distributed with mean $\\mathbb{E}_{Q}[W^{2}_{1}] = -\\lambda_{2}$ and variance $\\text{Var}_{Q}(W^{2}_{1}) = \\text{Var}_{Q}(W^{2,Q}_{1}) = 1$. So, under $Q$, $W^{2}_{1} \\sim N(-\\lambda_{2}, 1)$.\n\nThe probability $Q(W^{2}_{1} \\geq 0)$ can be computed by standardizing the variable. Let $Z \\sim N(0,1)$.\n$$\nQ(W^{2}_{1} \\geq 0) = Q\\left(\\frac{W^{2}_{1} - (-\\lambda_{2})}{\\sqrt{1}} \\geq \\frac{0 - (-\\lambda_{2})}{\\sqrt{1}}\\right) = P(Z \\geq \\lambda_{2})\n$$\nThis probability is $1 - \\Phi(\\lambda_{2})$, where $\\Phi(\\cdot)$ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.\nThe price under an EMM $Q$ with parameter $\\lambda_{2}$ is thus:\n$$\np_Q = \\exp(-rT) (1 - \\Phi(\\lambda_{2}))\n$$\nWith $r=0.05$ and $T=1$, this simplifies to:\n$$\np_Q = \\exp(-0.05) (1 - \\Phi(\\lambda_{2}))\n$$\nThe martingale constraint is $\\sigma\\lambda_{1} + \\gamma\\lambda_{2} = \\mu-r$. Substituting the numerical values:\n$$\n0.2\\lambda_{1} + 0.3\\lambda_{2} = 0.12 - 0.05 = 0.07\n$$\n\n**1. Compute the price $p_{Q^{(1)}}$**\nFor the measure $Q^{(1)}$, we are given $\\lambda_{2}^{(1)} = 0$. We first check that this corresponds to a valid EMM by finding the associated $\\lambda_{1}^{(1)}$:\n$$\n0.2\\lambda_{1}^{(1)} + 0.3(0) = 0.07 \\implies \\lambda_{1}^{(1)} = \\frac{0.07}{0.2} = 0.35\n$$\nSince a valid $\\lambda_{1}^{(1)}$ exists, $Q^{(1)}$ is a valid EMM.\nThe price under $Q^{(1)}$ is found by substituting $\\lambda_{2}^{(1)}=0$ into our general price formula:\n$$\np_{Q^{(1)}} = \\exp(-0.05) (1 - \\Phi(0))\n$$\nSince $\\Phi(0) = 0.5$, we have:\n$$\np_{Q^{(1)}} = 0.5 \\exp(-0.05) \\approx 0.5 \\times 0.9512294 = 0.4756147\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $p_{Q^{(1)}} \\approx 0.4756$.\n\n**2. Compute the price $p_{Q^{(2)}}$**\nFor the measure $Q^{(2)}$, we are given $\\lambda_{2}^{(2)} = 0.1$. We find the associated $\\lambda_{1}^{(2)}$:\n$$\n0.2\\lambda_{1}^{(2)} + 0.3(0.1) = 0.07 \\implies 0.2\\lambda_{1}^{(2)} = 0.07 - 0.03 = 0.04 \\implies \\lambda_{1}^{(2)} = \\frac{0.04}{0.2} = 0.2\n$$\nSince a valid $\\lambda_{1}^{(2)}$ exists, $Q^{(2)}$ is a valid EMM.\nThe price under $Q^{(2)}$ is found by substituting $\\lambda_{2}^{(2)}=0.1$:\n$$\np_{Q^{(2)}} = \\exp(-0.05) (1 - \\Phi(0.1))\n$$\nUsing a standard normal table or calculator, $\\Phi(0.1) \\approx 0.5398278$.\n$$\np_{Q^{(2)}} \\approx \\exp(-0.05) (1 - 0.5398278) = \\exp(-0.05) \\times 0.4601722\n$$\n$$\np_{Q^{(2)}} \\approx 0.9512294 \\times 0.4601722 = 0.4377439\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $p_{Q^{(2)}} \\approx 0.4377$.\n\n**3. Compute the superhedging bounds $L$ and $U$**\nThe superhedging bounds are the infimum ($L$) and supremum ($U$) of the set of all possible arbitrage-free prices. The price depends only on $\\lambda_{2}$:\n$$\np(\\lambda_{2}) = \\exp(-0.05) (1 - \\Phi(\\lambda_{2}))\n$$\nWe need to find the range of possible values for $\\lambda_{2}$. The martingale constraint $0.2\\lambda_{1} + 0.3\\lambda_{2} = 0.07$ can be rearranged to solve for $\\lambda_{1}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{1} = \\frac{0.07 - 0.3\\lambda_{2}}{0.2} = 0.35 - 1.5\\lambda_{2}\n$$\nFor any real value of $\\lambda_{2}$, there exists a corresponding real value of $\\lambda_{1}$ that satisfies the constraint. Since there are no other constraints on $\\lambda_{1}$ or $\\lambda_{2}$, the parameter $\\lambda_{2}$ can take any value in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nWe must therefore find the infimum and supremum of $p(\\lambda_{2})$ over $\\lambda_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The function $\\Phi(\\lambda_{2})$ is strictly increasing over $\\mathbb{R}$, with $\\lim_{\\lambda_{2}\\to-\\infty} \\Phi(\\lambda_{2}) = 0$ and $\\lim_{\\lambda_{2}\\to\\infty} \\Phi(\\lambda_{2}) = 1$.\nConsequently, the function $1 - \\Phi(\\lambda_{2})$ is strictly decreasing over $\\mathbb{R}$, and its range is $(0, 1)$.\n\nThe supremum of the price is:\n$$\nU = \\sup_{\\lambda_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}} \\left\\{ \\exp(-0.05) (1 - \\Phi(\\lambda_{2})) \\right\\} = \\exp(-0.05) \\times \\sup_{\\lambda_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}} (1 - \\Phi(\\lambda_{2}))\n$$\n$$\nU = \\exp(-0.05) \\times \\lim_{\\lambda_{2}\\to-\\infty}(1 - \\Phi(\\lambda_{2})) = \\exp(-0.05) \\times 1 = \\exp(-0.05)\n$$\n$$\nU \\approx 0.9512294\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $U \\approx 0.9512$.\n\nThe infimum of the price is:\n$$\nL = \\inf_{\\lambda_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}} \\left\\{ \\exp(-0.05) (1 - \\Phi(\\lambda_{2})) \\right\\} = \\exp(-0.05) \\times \\inf_{\\lambda_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}} (1 - \\Phi(\\lambda_{2}))\n$$\n$$\nL = \\exp(-0.05) \\times \\lim_{\\lambda_{2}\\to\\infty}(1 - \\Phi(\\lambda_{2})) = \\exp(-0.05) \\times 0 = 0\n$$\nSo, $L=0$.\n\nFinal numerical values rounded to four significant figures are:\n$p_{Q^{(1)}} \\approx 0.4756$\n$p_{Q^{(2)}} \\approx 0.4377$\n$L = 0$\n$U \\approx 0.9512$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.4756 & 0.4377 & 0 & 0.9512\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3055777"}]}
