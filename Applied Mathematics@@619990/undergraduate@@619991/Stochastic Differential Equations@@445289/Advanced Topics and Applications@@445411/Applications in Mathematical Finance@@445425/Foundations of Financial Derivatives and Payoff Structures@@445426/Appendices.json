The solution process may proceed.\n\nThe objective is to find the explicit strong solution for the stochastic differential equation:\n$$\ndS_{t} = \\mu S_{t}\\,dt + \\sigma S_{t}\\,dW_{t}\n$$\nwith initial condition $S_{0}  0$. The coefficients $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ are constants.\n\nThe structure of the SDE, where the drift and diffusion terms are proportional to the process $S_{t}$ itself, suggests that a logarithmic transformation may simplify the equation. Let us define a new process $X_{t}$ as a function of $S_{t}$:\n$$\nX_{t} = f(S_{t}) = \\ln(S_{t})\n$$\nSince $S_t$ represents an asset price, we can assume $S_{t}  0$ for all $t \\geq 0$ if $S_0  0$, ensuring that the logarithm is well-defined. We seek the SDE that $X_{t}$ satisfies. To do this, we apply Itô's lemma.\n\nFor a twice-differentiable function $f(S_t)$, Itô's lemma gives the differential $df(S_t)$ as:\n$$\ndf(S_{t}) = f'(S_{t})\\,dS_{t} + \\frac{1}{2}f''(S_{t})\\,(dS_{t})^2\n$$\nThe term $(dS_{t})^2$ represents the quadratic variation of the process $S_{t}$. From the definition of $dS_{t}$, we compute this term using the symbolic multiplication rules of Itô calculus: $(dt)^2 = 0$, $dt\\,dW_{t} = 0$, and $(dW_{t})^2 = dt$.\n$$\n(dS_{t})^2 = (\\mu S_{t}\\,dt + \\sigma S_{t}\\,dW_{t})^2 = (\\mu S_{t})^2\\,(dt)^2 + 2\\mu\\sigma S_{t}^2\\,dt\\,dW_{t} + (\\sigma S_{t})^2\\,(dW_{t})^2\n$$\nApplying the multiplication rules, only the final term is non-zero:\n$$\n(dS_{t})^2 = \\sigma^2 S_{t}^2\\,dt\n$$\nNow, we compute the necessary derivatives for our choice of $f(S_{t}) = \\ln(S_{t})$:\n$$\nf'(S_{t}) = \\frac{df}{dS_{t}} = \\frac{1}{S_{t}}\n$$\n$$\nf''(S_{t}) = \\frac{d^2f}{dS_{t}^2} = -\\frac{1}{S_{t}^2}\n$$\nSubstituting these derivatives and the expression for $(dS_{t})^2$ into the formula for Itô's lemma:\n$$\ndX_{t} = d(\\ln(S_{t})) = \\left(\\frac{1}{S_{t}}\\right)\\,dS_{t} + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(-\\frac{1}{S_{t}^2}\\right)(\\sigma^2 S_{t}^2\\,dt)\n$$\nNext, we substitute the original SDE for $dS_{t}$:\n$$\ndX_{t} = \\left(\\frac{1}{S_{t}}\\right)(\\mu S_{t}\\,dt + \\sigma S_{t}\\,dW_{t}) - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\,dt\n$$\nSimplifying the terms, we obtain:\n$$\ndX_{t} = (\\mu\\,dt + \\sigma\\,dW_{t}) - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\,dt\n$$\nGrouping the $dt$ and $dW_{t}$ terms yields the SDE for $X_{t}$:\n$$\ndX_{t} = \\left(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)dt + \\sigma\\,dW_{t}\n$$\nThis is a simple linear SDE with constant drift $(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)$ and constant diffusion $\\sigma$.

The first integral on the right is a standard Riemann integral with respect to time, and the second is an Itô integral. Evaluating these integrals yields:\n$$\nX_{t} - X_{0} = \\left(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)t + \\sigma(W_{t} - W_{0})\n$$\nBy convention, a standard Brownian motion starts at zero, so $W_{0} = 0$.

A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation of the relation between the call price $C$ and the put price $P$ is based on the principle of no-arbitrage, which states that two portfolios with identical payoffs at a future time must have the same price today. We will construct two such portfolios with payoffs at the common maturity date $T$.\n\nLet's construct Portfolio A at time $t=0$:\n- Buy one European call option with strike $K$ and maturity $T$. The cost is $C$.\n- Sell one European put option with the same strike $K$ and maturity $T$. This generates an income of $P$.\nThe net cost of Portfolio A at time $t=0$ is $V_A(0) = C - P$.\n\nAt maturity $T$, the value of Portfolio A is the sum of the payoffs of the options:\n$V_A(T) = (S_T - K)^{+} - (K - S_T)^{+}$\nWe analyze this payoff for two cases:\n1. If $S_T  K$, the call is in-the-money and the put is out-of-the-money. $V_A(T) = (S_T - K) - 0 = S_T - K$.\n2. If $S_T \\le K$, the call is out-of-the-money and the put is in-the-money. $V_A(T) = 0 - (K - S_T) = S_T - K$.\nThus, for any value of $S_T$, the payoff of Portfolio A at maturity $T$ is exactly $S_T - K$.\n\nNow, let's construct Portfolio B at time $t=0$ that also has a guaranteed payoff of $S_T - K$ at time $T$.\nThe payoff $S_T - K$ consists of two parts: a long position in the stock and a short position in cash.\n- To replicate the $-K$ term, we can borrow cash at the risk-free rate. If we borrow an amount of $K \\exp(-rT)$ at time $t=0$, we will owe exactly $K$ at time $T$. The initial cash flow for this part of the portfolio is $+K \\exp(-rT)$.\n- To replicate the $S_T$ term, we need a position that is worth exactly $S_T$ at time $T$. A simple strategy of buying one share of the stock at $t=0$ is insufficient because the stock pays a continuous dividend stream at rate $q$. This dividend stream would represent an additional cash flow not present in the target payoff $S_T - K$.\n\nTo correctly price the claim of receiving $S_T$ at time $T$, we must consider the present value of this specific cash flow, separate from the dividend stream. In a risk-neutral world, the price of any contingent claim is its discounted expected payoff. The stock price process $\\{S_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ under the risk-neutral measure $\\mathbb{Q}$ for a stock paying a continuous dividend yield $q$ is described by the SDE:\n$$dS_t = (r - q)S_t dt + \\sigma S_t dW_t^{\\mathbb{Q}}$$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the volatility and $\\{W_t^{\\mathbb{Q}}\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ is a Wiener process under $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe expected stock price at time $T$ under $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}[S_T | S_0] = S_0 \\exp((r-q)T)$.\nThe no-arbitrage price at $t=0$ for a claim paying $S_T$ at time $T$ is its discounted expected value:\nPrice $= \\exp(-rT) \\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}[S_T | S_0] = \\exp(-rT) \\left( S_0 \\exp((r-q)T) \\right) = S_0 \\exp(-qT)$.\n\nSo, to replicate the $S_T$ component of the payoff, one must enter a position at $t=0$ that has a cost of $S_0 \\exp(-qT)$. This can be thought of as buying the stock but selling off the rights to the dividend stream until maturity.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of Portfolio B at $t=0$ is:\n$V_B(0) = (\\text{Cost to replicate } S_T) - (\\text{Amount borrowed to replicate } -K)$\n$V_B(0) = S_0 \\exp(-qT) - K \\exp(-rT)$.\n\nSince both Portfolio A and Portfolio B have the exact same payoff, $S_T - K$, at maturity $T$, the principle of no-arbitrage dictates that their initial costs must be equal:\n$V_A(0) = V_B(0)$\n$$C - P = S_0 \\exp(-qT) - K \\exp(-rT)$$\nThis is the put-call parity relationship for European options on a stock paying a continuous dividend yield.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires computing the numerical value of $C - P$ given the specific parameter values:\n- $S_0 = 105$\n- $K = 100$\n- $r = 0.03$ (i.e., $3\\%$)\n- $q = 0.02$ (i.e., $2\\%$)\n- $T = 1$ (one year)\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived put-call parity formula:\n$C - P = 105 \\cdot \\exp(-0.02 \\cdot 1) - 100 \\cdot \\exp(-0.03 \\cdot 1)$\n$C - P = 105 \\cdot \\exp(-0.02) - 100 \\cdot \\exp(-0.03)$\n\nWe compute the values of the exponential terms:\n$\\exp(-0.02) \\approx 0.9801986733$\n$\\exp(-0.03) \\approx 0.9704455335$\n\nNow, substitute these into the expression for $C - P$:\n$C - P \\approx 105 \\times 0.9801986733 - 100 \\times 0.9704455335$\n$C - P \\approx 102.92086070 - 97.04455335$\n$C - P \\approx 5.87630735$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures. The number is $5.87630735$. The first four significant figures are $5$, $8$, $7$, and $6$. The fifth significant figure is $3$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\nThe result rounded to four significant figures is $5.876$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{5.876}\n$$", "id": "3055093"}]}
