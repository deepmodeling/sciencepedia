The problem statement provides all necessary data for a one-period binomial model: the initial price of the risky asset $S_0$, the up and down factors $u$ and $d$, the risk-free return factor $R_f$, and the condition for no arbitrage, $d  R_f  u$. The problem asks for the derivation of the risk-neutral probability and its application to price a European call option. These are standard, well-defined tasks within the established mathematical framework of asset pricing. The provided numerical values ($u = 1.3$, $d = 0.85$, $R_f = 1.02$) satisfy the no-arbitrage condition $0.85  1.02  1.3$. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Risk-Neutral Probability\n\nLet the sample space for the one-period market be $\\Omega = \\{\\omega_u, \\omega_d\\}$, where $\\omega_u$ represents the 'up' state and $\\omega_d$ represents the 'down' state. A risk-neutral probability measure (RNPM), denoted by $\\mathbb{Q}$, assigns probabilities to these states, which we will call $q$ and $1-q$ respectively:\n$$ q = \\mathbb{Q}(\\{\\omega_u\\}) $$\n$$ 1-q = \\mathbb{Q}(\\{\\omega_d\\}) $$\nThe fundamental theorem of asset pricing states that in an arbitrage-free market, there exists a risk-neutral probability measure $\\mathbb{Q}$ such that the price process of any traded asset, when discounted by the price of the risk-free asset (the numeraire), is a martingale under $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe risk-free asset has price $B_0 = 1$ at time $t=0$ and $B_1 = R_f$ at time $t=1$. The risky asset has price $S_0$ at $t=0$ and $S_1$ at $t=1$, where $S_1$ can take two possible values: $S_1(\\omega_u) = uS_0$ or $S_1(\\omega_d) = dS_0$.\n\nThe discounted price of the risky asset at time $t$ is defined as $\\tilde{S}_t = S_t / B_t$.\nAt time $t=0$, the discounted price is $\\tilde{S}_0 = S_0 / B_0 = S_0 / 1 = S_0$.\nAt time $t=1$, the discounted price is $\\tilde{S}_1 = S_1 / B_1 = S_1 / R_f$.\n\nThe martingale property under the RNPM $\\mathbb{Q}$ requires that the expected value of the future discounted price, conditional on the information available at time $t=0$ (the filtration $\\mathcal{F}_0$), equals the current discounted price.\n$$ E_\\mathbb{Q}[\\tilde{S}_1 | \\mathcal{F}_0] = \\tilde{S}_0 $$\nSince at time $t=0$ all values are known, the conditional expectation is simply the unconditional expectation under $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n$$ E_\\mathbb{Q}\\left[\\frac{S_1}{R_f}\\right] = S_0 $$\nWe can expand the expectation on the left-hand side using the definition of expecation over the discrete sample space:\n$$ E_\\mathbb{Q}[S_1] = S_1(\\omega_u) \\cdot \\mathbb{Q}(\\{\\omega_u\\}) + S_1(\\omega_d) \\cdot \\mathbb{Q}(\\{\\omega_d\\}) $$\n$$ E_\\mathbb{Q}[S_1] = (uS_0) \\cdot q + (dS_0) \\cdot (1-q) $$\nSubstituting this back into the martingale equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{R_f} \\left[ q(uS_0) + (1-q)(dS_0) \\right] = S_0 $$\nSince the asset must have a non-zero price, we can assume $S_0 > 0$ and divide both sides by $S_0$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{R_f} \\left[ qu + (1-q)d \\right] = 1 $$\nNow we solve for the risk-neutral probability $q$:\n$$ qu + d - qd = R_f $$\n$$ q(u - d) = R_f - d $$\n$$ q = \\frac{R_f - d}{u - d} $$\nThis expression gives the unique risk-neutral probability for the 'up' state. The no-arbitrage condition $d  R_f  u$ ensures that the numerator $R_f - d$ and the denominator $u - d$ are both positive, and that $R_f - d  u - d$, which guarantees that $0  q  1$.\n\nPart 2: Valuation of the European Call Option\n\nWe are given the specific parameter values: $S_0 = 100$, $u = 1.3$, $d = 0.85$, $R_f = 1.02$, and the strike price $K = 110$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the possible prices of the risky asset at time $t=1$:\n- In the up state: $S_1^u = u S_0 = 1.3 \\times 100 = 130$.\n- In the down state: $S_1^d = d S_0 = 0.85 \\times 100 = 85$.\n\nNext, we determine the payoff of the European call option, $X(S_1) = \\max(S_1 - K, 0)$, in each state:\n- Payoff in the up state: $X_u = \\max(S_1^u - K, 0) = \\max(130 - 110, 0) = 20$.\n- Payoff in the down state: $X_d = \\max(S_1^d - K, 0) = \\max(85 - 110, 0) = 0$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of the risk-neutral probability $q$ using the formula derived in Part 1:\n$$ q = \\frac{R_f - d}{u - d} = \\frac{1.02 - 0.85}{1.3 - 0.85} = \\frac{0.17}{0.45} = \\frac{17}{45} $$\nThe risk-neutral probability of the down state is $1-q = 1 - \\frac{17}{45} = \\frac{28}{45}$.\n\nThe no-arbitrage price of the option at time $t=0$, denoted $V_0$, is the discounted expected value of its future payoff under the risk-neutral measure $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n$$ V_0 = E_\\mathbb{Q}\\left[\\frac{X(S_1)}{B_1}\\right] = \\frac{1}{R_f} E_\\mathbb{Q}[X(S_1)] $$\nWe calculate the expected payoff:\n$$ E_\\mathbb{Q}[X(S_1)] = X_u \\cdot q + X_d \\cdot (1-q) $$\n$$ E_\\mathbb{Q}[X(S_1)] = (20) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{17}{45}\\right) + (0) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{28}{45}\\right) = \\frac{340}{45} $$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$ E_\\mathbb{Q}[X(S_1)] = \\frac{68 \\times 5}{9 \\times 5} = \\frac{68}{9} $$\nFinally, we discount this expected payoff to find the option's price at $t=0$:\n$$ V_0 = \\frac{1}{R_f} \\left(\\frac{68}{9}\\right) = \\frac{1}{1.02} \\left(\\frac{68}{9}\\right) = \\frac{68}{1.02 \\times 9} = \\frac{68}{9.18} $$\nPerforming the division to obtain a numerical value:\n$$ V_0 \\approx 7.407407407... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ V_0 \\approx 7.407 $$\nThis is the no-arbitrage price of the European call option.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{7.407}\n$$", "id": "3072796"}, {"introduction": "From the discrete world, we now transition to the continuous-time framework that forms the heart of modern quantitative finance.

Dynamics of the Discounted Asset Price**\n\nFirst, we determine the stochastic differential equation (SDE) for the discounted asset price process $\\tilde{S}_t = S_t / B_t = S_t \\exp(-rt)$. We apply Ito's lemma to the function $f(t, S_t) = S_t \\exp(-rt)$. The partial derivatives of $f$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} = -r S_t \\exp(-rt) = -r \\tilde{S}_t\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial S} = \\exp(-rt)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial S^2} = 0\n$$\nBy Ito's lemma, the differential $\\mathrm{d}\\tilde{S}_t$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\tilde{S}_t = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}\\mathrm{d}t + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial S}\\mathrm{d}S_t + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial S^2}(\\mathrm{d}S_t)^2\n$$\nSubstituting the derivatives and the SDE for $S_t$, we get:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\tilde{S}_t = -r S_t \\exp(-rt) \\mathrm{d}t + \\exp(-rt)(\\mu S_t \\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma S_t \\mathrm{d}W_t) + 0\n$$\nFactoring out $\\exp(-rt)S_t = \\tilde{S}_t$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\tilde{S}_t = \\tilde{S}_t(-r + \\mu)\\mathrm{d}t + \\tilde{S}_t\\sigma \\mathrm{d}W_t\n$$\nSo, the dynamics of the discounted asset price under the physical measure $\\mathbb{P}$ are:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\tilde{S}_t = (\\mu - r)\\tilde{S}_t \\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma \\tilde{S}_t \\mathrm{d}W_t\n$$\n\n**2. Change of Measure and Girsanov's Theorem**\n\nWe want to find an equivalent measure $\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\tilde{S}$ is a $\\mathbb{Q}$-martingale. This means the drift term of $\\tilde{S}_t$ must be zero under $\\mathbb{Q}$. We introduce a change of measure via a Radon-Nikodym density process $Z=(Z_t)_{t \\in [0,T]}$, where $Z_t = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbb{Q}}{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbb{P}}\\big|_{\\mathcal{F}_t}$. We are given that this process is of exponential-martingale type, associated with a constant \"market price of risk\" $\\lambda$. This corresponds to the Doléans-Dade exponential:\n$$\nZ_t = \\mathcal{E}(-\\lambda W)_t = \\exp\\left(-\\lambda W_t - \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda^2 t\\right)\n$$\nBy Girsanov's theorem, if $Z$ is a uniformly integrable martingale, then under the measure $\\mathbb{Q}$, the process $W^\\mathbb{Q}_t$ defined by:\n$$\nW^\\mathbb{Q}_t = W_t + \\int_0^t \\lambda \\,\\mathrm{d}s = W_t + \\lambda t\n$$\nis a standard Brownian motion. In differential form, this relationship is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}W^\\mathbb{Q}_t = \\mathrm{d}W_t + \\lambda \\mathrm{d}t \\quad \\implies \\quad \\mathrm{d}W_t = \\mathrm{d}W^\\mathbb{Q}_t - \\lambda \\mathrm{d}t\n$$\n\n**3. Determining the Market Price of Risk $\\lambda$**\n\nWe substitute the expression for $\\mathrm{d}W_t$ into the SDE for $\\tilde{S}_t$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\tilde{S}_t = (\\mu - r)\\tilde{S}_t \\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma \\tilde{S}_t (\\mathrm{d}W^\\mathbb{Q}_t - \\lambda \\mathrm{d}t)\n$$\nCollecting the terms with $\\mathrm{d}t$ and $\\mathrm{d}W^\\mathbb{Q}_t$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\tilde{S}_t = (\\mu - r - \\sigma\\lambda)\\tilde{S}_t \\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma \\tilde{S}_t \\mathrm{d}W^\\mathbb{Q}_t\n$$\nFor $\\tilde{S}$ to be a $\\mathbb{Q}$-martingale, its drift under $\\mathbb{Q}$ must be zero. This requires the coefficient of the $\\mathrm{d}t$ term to be zero:\n$$\n\\mu - r - \\sigma\\lambda = 0\n$$\nSolving for $\\lambda$, we find the unique constant market price of risk that achieves this:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\mu - r}{\\sigma}\n$$\nWith this choice of $\\lambda$, the dynamics of the discounted asset price under the risk-neutral measure $\\mathbb{Q}$ become:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\tilde{S}_t = \\sigma \\tilde{S}_t \\mathrm{d}W^\\mathbb{Q}_t\n$$\nThis is a driftless geometric Brownian motion, which is a martingale.\n\n**4. The Terminal Radon-Nikodym Density $Z_T$**\n\nHaving determined $\\lambda$, we can now write the explicit form of the Radon-Nikodym density process $Z_t$ and its terminal value $Z_T$.\n$$\nZ_t = \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{\\mu-r}{\\sigma}\\right)W_t - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\mu-r}{\\sigma}\\right)^2 t\\right)\n$$\nThe terminal value at $t=T$ is therefore:\n$$\nZ_T = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbb{Q}}{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbb{P}}\\bigg|_{\\mathcal{F}_T} = \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{\\mu-r}{\\sigma}\\right)W_T - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\mu-r}{\\sigma}\\right)^2 T\\right)\n$$\n\n**5. Verification Steps**\n\nFirst, we must check that $Z=(Z_t)_{t \\in [0,T]}$ is a true $\\mathbb{P}$-martingale, not just a local martingale. For an exponential martingale of the form $\\mathcal{E}(\\int \\theta_s \\mathrm{d}W_s)_t$, Novikov's condition provides a sufficient condition for it to be a true martingale: $\\mathbb{E}_\\mathbb{P}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^T \\theta_s^2 \\mathrm{d}s\\right)\\right]  \\infty$. In our case, the process in the stochastic exponential is $-\\lambda W_t$, so $\\theta_s = -\\lambda$, which is a constant. The condition becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_\\mathbb{P}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^T (-\\lambda)^2 \\mathrm{d}s\\right)\\right] = \\mathbb{E}_\\mathbb{P}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda^2 T\\right)\\right] = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda^2 T\\right)\n$$\nSince $\\lambda$, and $T$ are finite constants, this expectation is finite. Thus, Novikov's condition is satisfied, and $Z_t$ is a true $\\mathbb{P}$-martingale. We can also verify this by direct computation of the expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_\\mathbb{P}[Z_t] = \\mathbb{E}_\\mathbb{P}\\left[\\exp\\left(-\\lambda W_t - \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda^2 t\\right)\\right] = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda^2 t\\right)\\mathbb{E}_\\mathbb{P}[\\exp(-\\lambda W_t)]\n$$\nSince $W_t \\sim N(0, t)$ under $\\mathbb{P}$, its moment-generating function is $\\mathbb{E}_\\mathbb{P}[\\exp(k W_t)] = \\exp(\\frac{1}{2}k^2 t)$. With $k=-\\lambda$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_\\mathbb{P}[\\exp(-\\lambda W_t)] = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(-\\lambda)^2 t\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda^2 t\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this back, we find:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_\\mathbb{P}[Z_t] = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda^2 t\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda^2 t\\right) = 1 = Z_0\n$$\nThis confirms that $Z_t$ is a $\\mathbb{P}$-martingale.\n\nSecond, we verify directly that $\\tilde{S}_t$ is a $\\mathbb{Q}$-martingale. We need to show $\\mathbb{E}_\\mathbb{Q}[\\tilde{S}_t | \\mathcal{F}_s] = \\tilde{S}_s$ for $s  t$. Using the change of measure formula for conditional expectations:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_\\mathbb{Q}[\\tilde{S}_t | \\mathcal{F}_s] = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}_\\mathbb{P}[Z_t \\tilde{S}_t | \\mathcal{F}_s]}{Z_s}\n$$\nThis requires showing that the process $Y_t = Z_t \\tilde{S}_t$ is a $\\mathbb{P}$-martingale. We use Ito's product rule on $Y_t$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}Y_t = Z_t \\mathrm{d}\\tilde{S}_t + \\tilde{S}_t \\mathrm{d}Z_t + \\mathrm{d}\\langle Z, \\tilde{S}\\rangle_t\n$$\nWe have the SDEs for $Z_t$ and $\\tilde{S}_t$ under $\\mathbb{P}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}Z_t = -\\lambda Z_t \\mathrm{d}W_t\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\tilde{S}_t = (\\mu - r)\\tilde{S}_t \\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma \\tilde{S}_t \\mathrm{d}W_t\n$$\nThe quadratic covariation term is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\langle Z, \\tilde{S}\\rangle_t = (-\\lambda Z_t)(\\sigma \\tilde{S}_t) \\mathrm{d}t = -\\lambda\\sigma Z_t \\tilde{S}_t \\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nSubstituting these into the product rule:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}Y_t = Z_t [(\\mu-r)\\tilde{S}_t \\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma\\tilde{S}_t \\mathrm{d}W_t] + \\tilde{S}_t [-\\lambda Z_t \\mathrm{d}W_t] - \\lambda\\sigma Z_t \\tilde{S}_t \\mathrm{d}t\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}Y_t = [(\\mu-r) - \\lambda\\sigma]Z_t \\tilde{S}_t \\mathrm{d}t + [\\sigma - \\lambda]Z_t \\tilde{S}_t \\mathrm{d}W_t\n$$\nFor $Y_t$ to be a $\\mathbb{P}$-martingale, its drift term must be zero. This means $\\mu - r - \\lambda\\sigma = 0$, which implies $\\lambda = \\frac{\\mu-r}{\\sigma}$. This is precisely the value we derived. With this $\\lambda$, $\\mathrm{d}Y_t$ has no drift, confirming $Y_t$ is a $\\mathbb{P}$-martingale.\nTherefore, $\\mathbb{E}_\\mathbb{P}[Y_t | \\mathcal{F}_s] = Y_s$, which is $\\mathbb{E}_\\mathbb{P}[Z_t \\tilde{S}_t | \\mathcal{F}_s] = Z_s \\tilde{S}_s$.\nFinally:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_\\mathbb{Q}[\\tilde{S}_t | \\mathcal{F}_s] = \\frac{Z_s \\tilde{S}_s}{Z_s} = \\tilde{S}_s\n$$\nThis completes the verification.\n\nThe final answer is the pair $(\\lambda, Z_T)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\mu - r}{\\sigma}  \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{\\mu - r}{\\sigma}\\right) W_T - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\mu - r}{\\sigma}\\right)^2 T\\right) \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3072744"}, {"introduction": "The power of martingale pricing theory rests on a few key mathematical assumptions.

We will address each task in sequence.\n\nFirst, we derive the stochastic differential equation (SDE) for $\\tilde{S}_{t}$ and explain why it is a local martingale.\nWe are given $\\tilde{S}_{t} = f(R_{t})$ where $f(x) = 1/x$. The derivatives of $f(x)$ are:\n$f'(x) = -1/x^2$\n$f''(x) = 2/x^3$\nThe process $(R_{t})_{t \\geq 0}$ follows the SDE:\n$$dR_{t} = dW_{t} + \\frac{1}{R_{t}}\\,dt$$\nWe apply Itô's formula to $\\tilde{S}_{t} = f(R_{t})$:\n$$d\\tilde{S}_{t} = f'(R_{t}) dR_{t} + \\frac{1}{2} f''(R_{t}) (dR_{t})^2$$\nSubstituting the derivatives and the SDE for $R_t$:\n$$d\\tilde{S}_{t} = \\left(-\\frac{1}{R_{t}^2}\\right) \\left(dW_{t} + \\frac{1}{R_{t}}\\,dt\\right) + \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{2}{R_{t}^3}\\right) \\left(dW_{t} + \\frac{1}{R_{t}}\\,dt\\right)^2$$\nWe use the rules of Itô calculus, where $(dW_{t})^2 = dt$, $dt \\cdot dW_{t} = 0$, and $(dt)^2 = 0$. Thus, the quadratic variation term is:\n$$(dR_{t})^2 = \\left(dW_{t} + \\frac{1}{R_{t}}\\,dt\\right)^2 = (dW_{t})^2 = dt$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $d\\tilde{S}_{t}$:\n$$d\\tilde{S}_{t} = -\\frac{1}{R_{t}^2} dW_{t} - \\frac{1}{R_{t}^3} dt + \\frac{1}{R_{t}^3} dt$$\nThe drift terms cancel out, yielding:\n$$d\\tilde{S}_{t} = -\\frac{1}{R_{t}^2} dW_{t}$$\nSince $\\tilde{S}_{t} = 1/R_{t}$, we can write the SDE in terms of $\\tilde{S}_{t}$:\n$$d\\tilde{S}_{t} = -(\\tilde{S}_{t})^2 dW_{t}$$\nAn Itô process is a local martingale if its SDE has a drift term equal to zero. The SDE for $\\tilde{S}_{t}$ is of the form $d\\tilde{S}_{t} = \\mu_{t} dt + \\sigma_{t} dW_{t}$ with drift $\\mu_t = 0$ and volatility $\\sigma_t = -(\\tilde{S}_{t})^2$. Because the drift term is zero, the process $(\\tilde{S}_{t})_{t \\geq 0}$ is, by definition, a local martingale under the measure $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nSecond, we compute a closed-form expression for $\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}[\\tilde{S}_{T}]$.\nWe are given that $R_{T}$ has the same law as $|B_{T} + x_{0}|$, where $(B_{t})_{t \\geq 0}$ is a three-dimensional Brownian motion starting at the origin, and $x_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is a point with $|x_{0}| = r_{0}$. The expectation is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}[\\tilde{S}_{T}] = \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[\\frac{1}{R_{T}}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{|B_{T} + x_{0}|}\\right]$$\nThe vector $B_T$ has components $(B_T^{(1)}, B_T^{(2)}, B_T^{(3)})$, where each $B_T^{(i)}$ is an independent normal random variable with mean $0$ and variance $T$. So, $B_T \\sim N(0, T \\cdot I_3)$, where $I_3$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix. The probability density function of $B_T$ at position $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ is $p(y, T) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi T)^{3/2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|y|^2}{2T}\\right)$.\nThe expectation can be written as the convolution of the heat kernel with the function $g(x) = 1/|x|$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{|B_{T} + x_{0}|}\\right] = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} \\frac{1}{|y + x_{0}|} \\frac{1}{(2\\pi T)^{3/2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|y|^2}{2T}\\right) dy$$\nBy a change of variables $z = y + x_0$, this becomes:\n$$\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}[\\tilde{S}_{T}] = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} \\frac{1}{|z|} \\frac{1}{(2\\pi T)^{3/2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|z - x_0|^2}{2T}\\right) dz$$\nDue to rotational symmetry, the value of this integral depends only on the magnitude $|x_0| = r_0$, not the direction. We can choose a convenient coordinate system. Let's align $x_0$ with the z-axis, $x_0 = (0, 0, r_0)$. We use spherical coordinates for $z$: $z = (\\rho \\sin\\phi \\cos\\theta, \\rho \\sin\\phi \\sin\\theta, \\rho \\cos\\phi)$.\nThe terms in the integral become:\n$|z| = \\rho$\n$|z - x_0|^2 = x^2 + y^2 + (z-r_0)^2 = \\rho^2 - 2 \\rho r_0 \\cos\\phi + r_0^2$\n$dz = \\rho^2 \\sin\\phi \\, d\\rho \\, d\\phi \\, d\\theta$\nThe integral is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}[\\tilde{S}_{T}] = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi T)^{3/2}} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\rho^2 - 2 \\rho r_0 \\cos\\phi + r_0^2}{2T}\\right) \\rho^2 \\sin\\phi \\, d\\rho \\, d\\phi \\, d\\theta$$\nThe integrand is independent of $\\theta$, so the integral over $\\theta$ yields $2\\pi$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}[\\tilde{S}_{T}] = \\frac{2\\pi}{(2\\pi T)^{3/2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r_0^2}{2T}\\right) \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin\\phi \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\rho \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\rho^2 - 2 \\rho r_0 \\cos\\phi}{2T}\\right) d\\rho \\, d\\phi$$\nLet's swap the order of integration and integrate over $\\phi$ first.
