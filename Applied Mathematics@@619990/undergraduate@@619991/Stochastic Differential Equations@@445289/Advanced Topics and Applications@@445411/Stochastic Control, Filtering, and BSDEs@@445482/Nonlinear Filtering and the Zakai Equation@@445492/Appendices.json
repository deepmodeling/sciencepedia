Does it mean the coefficient in the polynomial `P(x)` or the coefficient of the highest power of `x` in the entire expression `L*ρ_t(x)`?\n            Let's re-read: \"identify the coefficient of the highest-degree monomial in x that appears in the dt-term\".

The term `x^k * exp(A x^2 + ...)` is not a monomial.\n            Let's reconsider the wording: \"expand the deterministic ($dt$) part that results from substituting the exponential-quadratic ansatz into the Zakai equation\".\n            The Zakai equation is `dρ_t = ...`.\n            Let's substitute `dρ_t` using the ansatz:\n            `ρ_t = exp(A_t x^2 + B_t x + C_t)`\n            `dρ_t = (x^2 dA_t + x dB_t + dC_t) ρ_t`\n            Equating the `dt` parts:\n            `(x^2 \\dot{A}_t + x \\dot{B}_t + \\dot{C}_t) ρ_t = L*ρ_t`\n            This implies `x^2 \\dot{A}_t + x \\dot{B}_t + \\dot{C}_t = L*ρ_t / ρ_t`.\n            The right hand side is the polynomial `P(x)` I calculated earlier.\n            `P(x) = -2A_tθ_3 x^4 - B_tθ_3 x^3 + (2σ^2A_t^2 - 3θ_3 - 2A_tθ_1)x^2 + (2σ^2A_tB_t - B_tθ_1)x + (σ^2A_t + (1/2)σ^2B_t^2 - θ_1)`.\n            So we have `x^2 \\dot{A}_t + x \\dot{B}_t + \\dot{C}_t = P(x)`.\n            The left side is a quadratic in `x`. The right side is a quartic in `x`.\n            For the equality to hold, the coefficients of `x^4` and `x^3` on the right must be zero. This is the essence of moment closure/Gaussian approximation methods. The ansatz `ρ_t(x) = exp(A_t x^2 + B_t x + C_t)` is generally not a solution, but an approximation. The method works by matching the coefficients of the lower order terms and setting the higher order ones to zero (or approximating them).\n            The problem seems to imply that the ansatz might not hold, as it asks to identify a coefficient. If the ansatz were an exact solution, the quartic and cubic terms would vanish, i.e., `-2A_tθ_3 = 0` and `-B_tθ_3 = 0`. Since `θ_3` is a general constant, this would force `A_t=0` and `B_t=0`, which is not a general Gaussian.\n\n            Let's re-read the problem again, very carefully. \"Suppose we test whether the unnormalized posterior remains within the exponential-quadratic family...

So I need to find `-2A_0θ_3`.\n            The problem states that at `t=0`, the posterior is Gaussian with mean `m_0` and variance `s_0  0`.\n            The *posterior* `p_0(x)` is `N(m_0, s_0)`.\n            `p_0(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi s_0}} \\exp\\left( - \\frac{(x-m_0)^2}{2s_0} \\right)`.\n            The unnormalized posterior `ρ_0(x)` is proportional to this.\n            `ρ_0(x) = K * p_0(x)` for some constant `K`.\n            So, `ρ_0(x) = \\frac{K}{\\sqrt{2\\pi s_0}} \\exp\\left( - \\frac{x^2 - 2m_0x + m_0^2}{2s_0} \\right)`.\n            `ρ_0(x) = \\exp\\left( -\\frac{1}{2s_0}x^2 + \\frac{m_0}{s_0}x - \\frac{m_0^2}{2s_0} + \\ln\\left(\\frac{K}{\\sqrt{2\\pi s_0}}\\right) \\right)`.\n            This matches the ansatz `ρ_0(x) = \\exp(A_0 x^2 + B_0 x + C_0)`.\n            By comparing the coefficients of the powers of `x` in the exponent, we can identify `A_0`, `B_0`, and `C_0`.\n            Coefficient of `x^2`: `A_0 = -1 / (2s_0)`.\n            Coefficient of `x`: `B_0 = m_0 / s_0`.\n            Constant term: `C_0 = -m_0^2 / (2s_0) + \\ln(...)`.\n\n            The highest-degree monomial in `P(x)` at `t=0` is `-2A_0θ_3 x^4`.\n            The coefficient is `-2A_0θ_3`.\n            I need to express this in terms of `θ_3` and `s_0`.\n            I have `A_0 = -1 / (2s_0)`.\n            So the coefficient is `-2 * (-1 / (2s_0)) * θ_3`.\n            This simplifies to `θ_3 / s_0`.\n\n            The problem statement is specific: \"Express your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $\\theta_3$ and $s_0$ only.\"\n            My answer `θ_3/s_0` fits this perfectly. It doesn't depend on `m_0`, `c`, `σ`, or `θ_1`, which makes sense because those terms don't contribute to the `x^4` term.\n            `B_0` depends on `m_0`, and `B_0` multiplies the `x^3` term coefficient.\n            `σ` and `θ_1` appear in the `x^2` term coefficient.\n            This confirms the dependencies seem right.\n\n    *   **Final structure of the solution:**\n        *   Start with validating the problem.

This practice explores a critical failure mode where an unbounded observation function can cause the unnormalized posterior to become non-integrable, leading to a breakdown of the filter. By analyzing a degenerate case without observation noise, you will isolate the delicate balance between the information from the prior and the likelihood from new data, revealing fundamental conditions for the stability of the filtering problem [@problem_id:3068635].", "problem": "Consider a partially observed system in continuous time. The hidden signal $X_t$ evolves according to the deterministic differential equation\n$$\ndX_t = 0, \\quad X_t \\equiv X_0,\n$$\nwith prior density $f_0(x) = C \\exp(-x^2)$ for some normalizing constant $C \\in (0,\\infty)$. The observation process is\n$$\ndY_t = h(X_t) \\, dt,\n$$\nwith an unbounded observation function $h(x) = x^3$. In standard nonlinear filtering under nondegenerate observation noise, the unnormalized conditional density process solves the Zakai equation, and its formal solution involves a stabilizing Itô correction term that depends on the quadratic variation of the observation. However, when the observation noise is degenerate (that is, $Y_t$ has zero quadratic variation), this stabilizing term is absent and the unnormalized posterior over a short time interval $[0,\\tau]$ takes the form of a prior density multiplied by a likelihood factor of the form $\\exp(\\kappa h(x))$, where $\\kappa = \\int_0^{\\tau} dY_s$ is the observed cumulative increment.\n\nIn this degenerate setting, define the normalizing constant\n$$\nZ(\\kappa) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\big(-x^2 + \\kappa x^3\\big)\\, dx,\n$$\nwhich must be finite for the posterior to be well-defined.

Express your final answer as an exact number. No rounding is required and no physical units are involved.", "solution": "The problem requires us to first justify the form of the normalizing constant $Z(\\kappa)$ in a degenerate nonlinear filtering setting and then to determine the range of the parameter $\\kappa$ for which this constant is finite.\n\nFirst, we address the justification for the form of the unnormalized posterior density and its normalizing constant $Z(\\kappa)$. The standard nonlinear filtering problem considers a hidden state process $X_t$ and an observation process $Y_t$ given by\n$$dY_t = h(X_t) dt + \\sigma(t) dW_t$$\nwhere $W_t$ is a standard Wiener process, representing observation noise. The unnormalized conditional density of $X_t$ given the observations up to time $t$, denoted $p_t(x)$, is governed by the Zakai equation. Under the reference measure approach, the solution to the Zakai equation, known as the Kallianpur-Striebel formula, can be expressed as:\n$$p_t(x) = p_0(x) E_x \\left[ \\exp\\left( \\int_0^t h(X_s) dY_s - \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^t h(X_s)^2 ds \\right) \\right]$$\nHere, $p_0(x)$ is the prior density of $X_0$, and the expectation is taken with respect to the law of the state process $X_t$ starting at $X_0=x$. The term $-\\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^t h(X_s)^2 ds$ is an Itô correction term, which arises from the Girsanov theorem and ensures the exponential term is a martingale. This correction term is fundamentally linked to the quadratic variation of the observation process. Specifically, if we write the exponential part as a stochastic exponential (Doléans-Dade exponential) $\\mathcal{E}\\left(\\int h(X) dY\\right)_t$, its explicit form includes a correction proportional to the quadratic variation of the integrator, $\\langle Y \\rangle_t$. For $dY_t=h(X_t)dt+dW_t$, we have $d\\langle Y \\rangle_t = dt$, leading to the term shown.\n\nThe problem describes a degenerate case where the observation noise is absent. The observation process is given by the deterministic differential equation $dY_t = h(X_t) dt$. For a given path of $X_t$, the path of $Y_t$ is differentiable and therefore has finite variation over any finite time interval. A process with finite variation has a quadratic variation of zero, i.e., $\\langle Y \\rangle_t = 0$ for all $t \\ge 0$. As the problem statement correctly notes, the Itô correction term, which depends on the quadratic variation, is therefore absent.\n\nIn this degenerate setting, the Zakai equation for the unnormalized posterior $p_t(x)$ simplifies significantly. The state process is $dX_t=0$, so its generator's adjoint is $L^*=0$. The Zakai equation becomes:\n$$dp_t(x) = h(x) p_t(x) dY_t$$\nFor a fixed value of $x$, $h(x)$ is a constant. We can formally integrate this ordinary differential equation for $p_t(x)$ from $t=0$ to $t=\\tau$:\n$$\\int_{p_0(x)}^{p_\\tau(x)} \\frac{dp_s(x)}{p_s(x)} = \\int_0^\\tau h(x) dY_s$$\n$$\\ln(p_\\tau(x)) - \\ln(p_0(x)) = h(x) \\int_0^\\tau dY_s$$\nDefining the observed cumulative increment as $\\kappa = \\int_0^\\tau dY_s$, we obtain:\n$$p_\\tau(x) = p_0(x) \\exp(\\kappa h(x))$$\nGiven the prior density $f_0(x) = C \\exp(-x^2)$, proportional to $p_0(x)$, and the unbounded observation function $h(x) = x^3$, the unnormalized posterior density at time $\\tau$ is proportional to:\n$$\\exp(-x^2) \\exp(\\kappa x^3) = \\exp(-x^2 + \\kappa x^3)$$\nThe normalizing constant, $Z(\\kappa)$, is the integral of this expression over the entire state space, which justifies the given form:\n$$Z(\\kappa) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-x^2 + \\kappa x^3) dx$$\n\nNext, we determine the largest real number $\\kappa^\\star$ for which this integral is finite. The convergence of the integral depends on the asymptotic behavior of the integrand as $x \\to +\\infty$ and $x \\to -\\infty$. For the integral to converge, the integrand must decay to zero sufficiently fast in both limits. A necessary condition is that the exponent, $g(x, \\kappa) = -x^2 + \\kappa x^3$, must approach $-\\infty$ as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$.\n\nLet us analyze the behavior of $g(x, \\kappa)$ by examining its highest-order term, $\\kappa x^3$.\n\n1.

The integrand $\\exp(g(x, \\kappa))$ will diverge to $+\\infty$, causing the integral to diverge on any interval of the form $[a, +\\infty)$.\n    -   If $\\kappa = 0$, the exponent is $g(x, 0) = -x^2$, which approaches $-\\infty$ as $x \\to +\\infty$. The integrand decays rapidly, ensuring convergence on $[0, +\\infty)$.\n    -   If $\\kappa  0$, the limiting factor is negative, so the limit of $g(x, \\kappa)$ is $-\\infty$. The integrand decays, ensuring convergence on $[0, +\\infty)$.\n    For the integral to converge as $x \\to +\\infty$, we must have $\\kappa \\le 0$.\n\n2.  Behavior as $x \\to -\\infty$:\n    We again consider the limit of the exponent $g(x, \\kappa)$:\n    $$\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} (-x^2 + \\kappa x^3) = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} x^3 \\left(\\kappa - \\frac{1}{x}\\right)$$\n    As $x \\to -\\infty$, the term $x^3 \\to -\\infty$. The behavior of the limit depends on the sign of the factor $(\\kappa - 1/x)$, which approaches $\\kappa$.\n    -   If $\\kappa  0$, the factor is negative. The limit is $(-\\infty) \\times (\\text{negative number}) = +\\infty$. The integrand diverges, causing the integral to diverge on any interval of the form $(-\\infty, b]$.\n    -   If $\\kappa = 0$, the exponent is $g(x, 0) = -x^2$, which approaches $-\\infty$ as $x \\to -\\infty$. The integrand decays, ensuring convergence on $(-\\infty, 0]$.\n    -   If $\\kappa  0$, the factor is positive. The limit is $(-\\infty) \\times (\\text{positive number}) = -\\infty$. The integrand decays, ensuring convergence on $(-\\infty, 0]$.\n    For the integral to converge as $x \\to -\\infty$, we must have $\\kappa \\ge 0$.\n\nFor the integral $Z(\\kappa) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-x^2 + \\kappa x^3) dx$ to be finite, it must converge on both tails of the real line. This requires satisfying both conditions simultaneously:\n-   From the behavior at $x \\to +\\infty$, we need $\\kappa \\le 0$.\n-   From the behavior at $x \\to -\\infty$, we need $\\kappa \\ge 0$.\n\nThe only real number $\\kappa$ that satisfies both $\\kappa \\le 0$ and $\\kappa \\ge 0$ is $\\kappa = 0$.\nThus, the set of real numbers for which $Z(\\kappa)$ is finite is the singleton set $\\{0\\}$. The problem asks for the largest real number in this set, which is trivially $0$.\nTherefore, $\\kappa^\\star = 0$. This result highlights a critical feature of filtering with unbounded observation functions: unless the observed signal increment $\\kappa$ is exactly zero, the Gaussian prior is insufficient to regularize the likelihood, leading to an ill-defined (non-normalizable) posterior distribution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3068635"}]}
