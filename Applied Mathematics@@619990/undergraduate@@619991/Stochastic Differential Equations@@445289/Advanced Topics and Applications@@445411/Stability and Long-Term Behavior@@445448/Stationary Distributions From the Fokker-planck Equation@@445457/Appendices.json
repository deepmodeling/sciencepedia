The Itô SDE with a linear drift, $a(x) = -\\lambda x$, describes the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, a fundamental model in statistical mechanics and stochastic processes. The Fokker-Planck equation provided is the correct forward Kolmogorov equation for this process. The conditions of a confining drift ($\\lambda0$) and constant diffusion ($D0$) are standard for ensuring the existence of a unique, stable stationary distribution. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary equations, parameters, and boundary conditions clearly defined. It is well-posed and objective. The problem is a standard exercise in stochastic calculus and is free of any of the invalidating flaws listed in the instructions.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Stationary Solution\n\nThe stationary pdf, denoted $p_s(x)$, is defined by the condition $\\frac{\\partial p_s(x,t)}{\\partial t} = 0$. Applying this to the given Fokker-Planck equation yields the stationary Fokker-Planck equation:\n$$\n0 = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\big(a(x)\\,p_s(x)\\big) + D\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2}{\\mathrm{d}x^2}p_s(x)\n$$\nThis equation can be expressed as $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x} J(x) = 0$, where $J(x)$ is the probability current, defined as:\n$$\nJ(x) = a(x)\\,p_s(x) - D\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}p_s(x)\n$$\nThe condition $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}J(x)}{\\mathrm{d}x} = 0$ implies that the probability current $J(x)$ is a constant, say $J_0$. The problem states that the probability current vanishes for $|x|\\to\\infty$. This implies that $J_0=0$. Therefore, the probability current must be zero for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This gives us a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $p_s(x)$:\n$$\na(x)\\,p_s(x) - D\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p_s(x)}{\\mathrm{d}x} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the given drift term $a(x) = -\\lambda x$:\n$$\n-\\lambda x\\,p_s(x) - D\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p_s(x)}{\\mathrm{d}x} = 0\n$$\nRearranging this into a standard form for a first-order linear homogeneous ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p_s}{\\mathrm{d}x} + \\frac{\\lambda}{D}x\\,p_s(x) = 0\n$$\nAs requested by the problem, we use the integrating factor method. The integrating factor $I(x)$ is given by $I(x) = \\exp\\left(\\int \\frac{\\lambda}{D}x\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\right)$.\nCalculating the integral in the exponent:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{\\lambda}{D}x\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{\\lambda}{2D}x^2\n$$\nSo the integrating factor is $I(x) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\lambda x^2}{2D}\\right)$. Multiplying the ODE by $I(x)$:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\lambda x^2}{2D}\\right)\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p_s}{\\mathrm{d}x} + \\frac{\\lambda}{D}x\\,\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\lambda x^2}{2D}\\right)p_s(x) = 0\n$$\nThe left-hand side is the derivative of a product, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(p_s(x)I(x)\\right)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(p_s(x)\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\lambda x^2}{2D}\\right)\\right) = 0\n$$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $x$ gives:\n$$\np_s(x)\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\lambda x^2}{2D}\\right) = C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. Solving for $p_s(x)$, we obtain the stationary distribution up to a normalization constant:\n$$\np_s(x) = C\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda x^2}{2D}\\right)\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Normalization of the Stationary PDF\n\nFor $p_s(x)$ to be a valid pdf, its integral over the entire real line must equal $1$:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p_s(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = 1\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $p_s(x)$:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} C\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda x^2}{2D}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = 1\n$$\nThis is a standard Gaussian integral of the form $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ax^2)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{a}}$. In our case, the parameter $a$ is $\\frac{\\lambda}{2D}$. Therefore:\n$$\nC \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{\\frac{\\lambda}{2D}}} = C \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi D}{\\lambda}} = 1\n$$\nSolving for the normalization constant $C$:\n$$\nC = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi D}}\n$$\nThus, the fully normalized stationary probability density function is:\n$$\np_s(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi D}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda x^2}{2D}\\right)\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Calculation of the Variance\n\nThe stationary distribution $p_s(x)$ is a Gaussian (normal) distribution. A general Gaussian pdf has the form:\n$$\nf(x; \\mu, \\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the mean and $\\sigma^2$ is the variance.\nBy comparing our $p_s(x)$ with the general form, we can identify the mean and variance. Our distribution can be written as:\n$$\np_s(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\frac{D}{\\lambda}}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\frac{D}{\\lambda}}\\right)\n$$\nFrom this comparison, we can directly identify the mean $\\mu = 0$ and the variance $\\sigma^2 = \\frac{D}{\\lambda}$.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the variance using its definition, $\\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$.\nFirst, we compute the mean $E[X]$:\n$$\nE[X] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x p_s(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi D}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda x^2}{2D}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nThe integrand is an odd function (a product of an odd function $x$ and an even function, the Gaussian), integrated over a symmetric interval $(-\\infty, \\infty)$. Therefore, the integral is zero. $E[X] = 0$.\n\nNext, we compute the second moment $E[X^2]$:\n$$\nE[X^2] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 p_s(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi D}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda x^2}{2D}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nThis integral is a known result for Gaussian distributions. For an integral of the form $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}x^2\\exp(-ax^2)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{1}{2a}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{a}}$. Here, $a = \\frac{\\lambda}{2D}$.\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda x^2}{2D}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{1}{2\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{2D}\\right)}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{\\frac{\\lambda}{2D}}} = \\frac{D}{\\lambda}\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi D}{\\lambda}}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $E[X^2]$:\n$$\nE[X^2] = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi D}} \\left(\\frac{D}{\\lambda}\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi D}{\\lambda}}\\right) = \\frac{D}{\\lambda}\n$$\nThe variance is then $\\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 = \\frac{D}{\\lambda} - 0^2 = \\frac{D}{\\lambda}$. Both methods yield the same result. The variance of the process $X$ in the stationary state is $\\frac{D}{\\lambda}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{D}{\\lambda}}$$", "id": "3076241"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond equilibrium, this practice explores a system that reaches a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) due to a constant driving force.

This is a Langevin equation with a constant drift term $A(\\theta) = \\omega$ and a constant diffusion coefficient which we identify from the structure of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. The general form of the Fokker-Planck equation for a process $dx_t = A(x, t) dt + B(x, t) dW_t$ is $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(A p) + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}(B^2 p)$.\n\nIn this specific case, $A(\\theta) = \\omega$ and $B(\\theta) = \\sqrt{2D}$, so $B(\\theta)^2 = 2D$.

By comparing the two forms, we identify the current as:\n$$J(\\theta, t) = \\omega p(\\theta, t) - D \\frac{\\partial p(\\theta, t)}{\\partial \\theta}$$\nThe problem asks for the stationary solution, where the probability density does not change with time, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial p_s(\\theta)}{\\partial t} = 0$. The subscript $s$ denotes the stationary state. From the continuity equation, this implies that the divergence of the stationary current is zero. In one dimension, this means the derivative of the stationary current with respect to the spatial coordinate is zero:\n$$\\frac{\\partial J_s(\\theta)}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$$\nThis demonstrates that the stationary probability current, $J_s(\\theta)$, must be a constant, which we shall denote as $J_0$.

This means $p_s(\\theta) = p_s(\\theta + 2\\pi)$, and specifically $p_s(0) = p_s(2\\pi)$.\n    $$p_s(0) = \\frac{J_0}{\\omega} + C \\exp(0) = \\frac{J_0}{\\omega} + C$$\n    $$p_s(2\\pi) = \\frac{J_0}{\\omega} + C \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi\\omega}{D}\\right)$$\n    Equating these two expressions:\n    $$\\frac{J_0}{\\omega} + C = \\frac{J_0}{\\omega} + C \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi\\omega}{D}\\right)$$\n    $$C = C \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi\\omega}{D}\\right) \\implies C\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi\\omega}{D}\\right)\\right) = 0$$\n    Since the problem states $\\omega  0$ and $D  0$, the term $\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi\\omega}{D}\\right)$ is strictly greater than $1$. Therefore, the factor $\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi\\omega}{D}\\right)\\right)$ is non-zero. This forces the integration constant to be zero: $C = 0$.\n    The stationary distribution is thus a constant:\n    $$p_s(\\theta) = \\frac{J_0}{\\omega}$$\n\n2.  **Normalization**: The total probability over the entire domain must be equal to $1$.\n    $$\\int_0^{2\\pi} p_s(\\theta) d\\theta = 1$$\n    $$\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{J_0}{\\omega} d\\theta = 1$$\n    $$\\frac{J_0}{\\omega} [\\theta]_0^{2\\pi} = 1$$\n    $$\\frac{J_0}{\\omega} (2\\pi - 0) = 1 \\implies J_0 = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}$$\n\nHaving found $J_0$, we can determine both $p_s(\\theta)$ and $J_s(\\theta)$.\nThe stationary probability density is:\n$$p_s(\\theta) = \\frac{J_0}{\\omega} = \\frac{\\omega/(2\\pi)}{\\omega} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}$$\nThe stationary probability current is:\n$$J_s(\\theta) = J_0 = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}$$\nThe resulting stationary distribution $p_s(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}$ is uniform, which indicates that the rotor has no preferred position on the ring. The stationary current $J_s = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}$ is constant and non-zero, indicating a net flow of probability in the direction of the torque $\\omega$.\n\nNext, we verify whether $\\nabla \\cdot J_s = 0$ holds.

Since we found $J_s(\\theta)=\\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}$, which is a constant, its derivative is indeed zero:\n$$\\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}\\right) = 0$$\nThis condition, known as **global balance**, is a defining characteristic of any stationary state (both equilibrium and non-equilibrium). It ensures that the probability density at any point is time-invariant.\n\nFinally, we assess whether detailed balance holds. **Detailed balance** is a stricter condition that requires the net probability current to be identically zero everywhere, i.e., $J_s(\\theta) = 0$ for all $\\theta$. In our case, for $\\omega \\neq 0$:\n$$J_s = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} \\neq 0$$\nSince the stationary current is non-zero, **detailed balance fails**.\n\nThe physical distinction between these two conditions is crucial.\n**Global balance** ($\\nabla \\cdot J_s = 0$) characterizes a **stationary state**. It requires that the total probability flowing into any region of state space equals the total probability flowing out, thus keeping the density within that region constant. This allows for a non-zero net circulation of probability, which is the case here. This system is in a **non-equilibrium steady state (NESS)**. The constant torque $\\omega$ is a non-conservative force ($-\\omega \\theta$ is not a single-valued potential on the circle) that continuously performs work on the rotor, which is dissipated as heat into the environment (implicit in the overdamped SDE). This constant input and dissipation of energy maintains the system out of thermodynamic equilibrium, driving the non-zero current $J_s$.\n**Detailed balance** ($J_s = 0$) characterizes **thermodynamic equilibrium**. It requires that the rate of transition between any two states is equal to the rate of the reverse transition. This implies zero net flow of probability between any two points and forbids any macroscopic currents. Detailed balance would only hold in this system if the driving torque were zero, $\\omega=0$. In that case, $J_s=0$, and the system would be in equilibrium with its thermal environment.\nThe failure of detailed balance is a direct consequence of the non-conservative force (torque) breaking time-reversal symmetry and driving the system into a NESS.\n\nThe requested final answer is a row matrix containing $p_s(\\theta)$ and $J_s$.\n$p_s(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}$\n$J_s = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2\\pi}  \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3076213"}, {"introduction": "This exercise delves into the complexities of stochastic processes with state-dependent noise and boundaries, using the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model as a case study.

Exponentiating both sides gives the functional form of the stationary distribution:\n$$\np_s(x) = C\\, x^{\\left(\\frac{2\\kappa\\theta}{\\sigma^2} - 1\\right)} e^{-\\frac{2\\kappa}{\\sigma^2}x}\n$$\nwhere $C=e^{C_0}$ is a normalization constant. This is the probability density function of a Gamma distribution. For $p_s(x)$ to be a valid (normalizable) probability density on $(0, \\infty)$, its integral must be finite:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty p_s(x)\\,dx = C \\int_0^\\infty x^{\\left(\\frac{2\\kappa\\theta}{\\sigma^2} - 1\\right)} e^{-\\frac{2\\kappa}{\\sigma^2}x} dx  \\infty\n$$\nThe convergence of this integral depends on the behavior of the integrand near $x=0$ and as $x\\to\\infty$.\nAs $x\\to\\infty$, the exponential term $e^{-\\frac{2\\kappa}{\\sigma^2}x}$ decays faster than any power of $x$ grows (since $\\kappa0, \\sigma^20$), so the integral always converges at the upper limit.\nNear $x=0$, the integrand behaves like $x^{\\nu}$, where the exponent is $\\nu = \\frac{2\\kappa\\theta}{\\sigma^2} - 1$. The integral $\\int_0^\\epsilon x^\\nu dx$ converges if and only if $\\nu  -1$.\nIn our case, this condition is $\\frac{2\\kappa\\theta}{\\sigma^2} - 1  -1$, which simplifies to $\\frac{2\\kappa\\theta}{\\sigma^2}  0$. Since the problem states $\\kappa0, \\theta0, \\sigma0$, this condition is always met.\nTherefore, a normalizable stationary distribution exists for all valid parameters.\n\nNow we analyze the behavior at the boundary $x=0$:\n1.  **SDE Boundary Behavior**: The Feller condition, $2\\kappa\\theta \\ge \\sigma^2$, determines whether the boundary at $x=0$ is attainable.\n    - If $2\\kappa\\theta \\ge \\sigma^2$, the process $X_t$, starting from $X_0  0$, will almost surely never reach $x=0$. The boundary is unattainable.\n    - If $2\\kappa\\theta  \\sigma^2$, the process can reach $x=0$ in finite time with a positive probability. The boundary is attainable.\n    - When the process reaches $x=0$, the SDE becomes $dX_t = \\kappa(\\theta-0)dt + \\sigma\\sqrt{0}dW_t = \\kappa\\theta dt$. Since $\\kappa\\theta0$, there is a positive drift away from the origin. This means the boundary at $x=0$ is instantaneously reflecting; it is not absorbing (which would require the process to remain at $x=0$).\n\n2.  **Stationary Density Behavior at $x=0$**: The shape of $p_s(x)$ near $x=0$ depends on the exponent $\\frac{2\\kappa\\theta}{\\sigma^2} - 1$.\n    - If $2\\kappa\\theta  \\sigma^2$, the exponent is positive. Thus, $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} p_s(x) = 0$.\n    - If $2\\kappa\\theta = \\sigma^2$, the exponent is zero. Thus, $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} p_s(x) = C  0$. The density is finite and non-zero at the origin.\n    - If $2\\kappa\\theta  \\sigma^2$, the exponent is negative. Thus, $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} p_s(x) = \\infty$. The density has a singularity at the origin. As shown before, this singularity is integrable.\n\nWith this complete analysis, we can evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. If $2\\kappa\\theta\\ge \\sigma^2$, the boundary $x=0$ is unattainable (an entrance boundary) for trajectories started at $x0$, and there exists a unique stationary distribution on $(0,\\infty)$ whose density is well behaved at $x=0$ in the sense that it has a finite limit or vanishes there.**\n- **Boundary behavior:** The statement that the boundary $x=0$ is unattainable if $2\\kappa\\theta\\ge \\sigma^2$ is correct.\n- **Stationary distribution existence:** We proved a unique (up to normalization) stationary distribution exists for all positive parameters. So it exists in this case.\n- **Density at $x=0$:** We showed that if $2\\kappa\\theta\\ge \\sigma^2$, the density either vanishes (for $$ ) or approaches a finite constant (for $=$). This matches the description \"well behaved ... has a finite limit or vanishes\".\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. If $2\\kappa\\theta \\sigma^2$, the boundary $x=0$ is absorbing (once hit, $X_t$ stays at $0$), and no stationary distribution exists.**\n- **Boundary behavior:** We showed that the drift at $x=0$ is $\\kappa\\theta  0$, hence the boundary is instantaneously reflecting, not absorbing. This claim is incorrect.\n- **Stationary distribution existence:** We showed that a normalizable stationary distribution exists even when $2\\kappa\\theta  \\sigma^2$. This claim is also incorrect.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. If $2\\kappa\\theta \\sigma^2$, the boundary $x=0$ is attainable and instantaneously reflecting for the SDE above (the drift at $x=0$ pushes the process back into $(0,\\infty)$), and a stationary distribution exists; its density has an integrable singularity at $x=0$.**\n- **Boundary behavior:** When $2\\kappa\\theta  \\sigma^2$, the boundary is indeed attainable and, due to the positive drift $\\kappa\\theta$, instantaneously reflecting. This part is correct.\n- **Stationary distribution existence:** As established, a stationary distribution exists. This is correct.\n- **Density at $x=0$:** As shown in our analysis, for $2\\kappa\\theta  \\sigma^2$, the exponent of $x$ in $p_s(x)$ is negative, leading to an integrable singularity at $x=0$. This is correct.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**D. The existence of a stationary distribution requires $2\\kappa\\theta\\ge \\sigma^2$; otherwise the stationary Fokker–Planck equation has no normalizable solution.**\n- Our analysis of normalizability showed that the integral for the normalization constant converges for all $\\kappa0, \\theta0, \\sigma0$, regardless of the Feller condition. A normalizable solution always exists.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. At the threshold $2\\kappa\\theta=\\sigma^2$, the stationary density, if it exists, changes qualitatively and is no longer of the same functional family as for $2\\kappa\\theta\\ne \\sigma^2$.**\n- The functional form of the stationary density is always $p_s(x) \\propto x^{\\alpha-1} e^{-\\beta x}$, which is the family of Gamma distributions. At the threshold $2\\kappa\\theta=\\sigma^2$, the shape parameter $\\alpha = \\frac{2\\kappa\\theta}{\\sigma^2}$ becomes $1$. The Gamma distribution with shape parameter $1$ is the exponential distribution. The exponential distribution is a specific case *within* the Gamma family, not a different functional family. While the qualitative shape of the density curve changes (from having a mode at $x0$ to being monotonic), the function does not leave the family.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "3076182"}]}
