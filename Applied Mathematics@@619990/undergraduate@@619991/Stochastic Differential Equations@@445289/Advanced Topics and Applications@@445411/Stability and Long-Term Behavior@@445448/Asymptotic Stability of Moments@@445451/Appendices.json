Since the drift and diffusion coefficients are zero at $X_t=0$ and the initial condition is positive, the solution $X_t$ will remain positive for all $t \\geq 0$ almost surely. This allows for a change of variables to $Y_t = \\ln(X_t)$. To find the dynamics of $Y_t$, we apply Itô's lemma to the function $f(x) = \\ln(x)$. The derivatives are $f'(x) = 1/x$ and $f''(x) = -1/x^2$.\n\nAccording to Itô's lemma, the differential of $Y_t = f(X_t)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}Y_t = f'(X_t)\\mathrm{d}X_t + \\frac{1}{2}f''(X_t)(\\mathrm{d}X_t)^2\n$$\nThe quadratic variation term $(\\mathrm{d}X_t)^2$ is calculated using the Itô rules $(\\mathrm{d}t)^2=0$, $\\mathrm{d}t\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t=0$, and $(\\mathrm{d}W_t)^2=\\mathrm{d}t$:\n$$\n(\\mathrm{d}X_t)^2 = (a\\,X_t\\,\\mathrm{d}t + b\\,X_t\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t)^2 = (b\\,X_t)^2(\\mathrm{d}W_t)^2 = b^2 X_t^2 \\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\mathrm{d}X_t$ and $(\\mathrm{d}X_t)^2$ into the formula for $\\mathrm{d}Y_t$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}Y_t = \\frac{1}{X_t}(a\\,X_t\\,\\mathrm{d}t + b\\,X_t\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(-\\frac{1}{X_t^2}\\right)(b^2 X_t^2 \\mathrm{d}t)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}Y_t = (a\\,\\mathrm{d}t + b\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t) - \\frac{1}{2}b^2\\,\\mathrm{d}t = \\left(a - \\frac{b^2}{2}\\right)\\mathrm{d}t + b\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t\n$$\nIntegrating this SDE for $Y_t = \\ln(X_t)$ from $0$ to $t$ gives:\n$$\n\\ln(X_t) - \\ln(X_0) = \\int_0^t \\left(a - \\frac{b^2}{2}\\right)\\mathrm{d}s + \\int_0^t b\\,\\mathrm{d}W_s = \\left(a - \\frac{b^2}{2}\\right)t + b\\,W_t\n$$\nThe explicit solution for $X_t$ is obtained by exponentiating:\n$$\nX_t = X_0 \\exp\\left(\\left(a - \\frac{b^2}{2}\\right)t + b\\,W_t\\right)\n$$\nNext, we compute the $p$-th moment, $\\mathbb{E}[X_t^p]$, for $p0$:\n$$\nX_t^p = \\left(X_0 \\exp\\left(\\left(a - \\frac{b^2}{2}\\right)t + b\\,W_t\\right)\\right)^p = X_0^p \\exp\\left(p\\left(a - \\frac{b^2}{2}\\right)t + pb\\,W_t\\right)\n$$\nTaking the expectation, we note that $X_0$ is a deterministic constant:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_t^p] = X_0^p \\exp\\left(p\\left(a - \\frac{b^2}{2}\\right)t\\right) \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\exp(pb\\,W_t)\\right]\n$$\nThe random variable $W_t$ follows a normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, t)$. Therefore, the term $pb\\,W_t$ is also normally distributed with mean $\\mathbb{E}[pb\\,W_t] = pb\\,\\mathbb{E}[W_t] = 0$ and variance $\\mathrm{Var}(pb\\,W_t) = (pb)^2\\mathrm{Var}(W_t) = p^2b^2t$. For a normally distributed random variable $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, the expectation of its exponential is $\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(Z)] = \\exp(\\mu + \\sigma^2/2)$. Applying this result, we get:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\exp(pb\\,W_t)\\right] = \\exp\\left(0 + \\frac{p^2b^2t}{2}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{p^2b^2t}{2}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the moment:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_t^p] = X_0^p \\exp\\left(\\left(pa - \\frac{pb^2}{2} + \\frac{p^2b^2}{2}\\right)t\\right)\n$$\nNow we can compute the $p$-th moment Lyapunov exponent, $\\lambda_p$:\n$$\n\\lambda_p = \\limsup_{t\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{t}\\ln \\mathbb{E}[X_t^p] = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{t}\\ln\\left(X_0^p \\exp\\left(\\left(pa - \\frac{pb^2}{2} + \\frac{p^2b^2}{2}\\right)t\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSince the limit exists, the `limsup` becomes a `lim`.\n$$\n\\lambda_p = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{t}\\left[p\\ln(X_0) + \\left(pa - \\frac{pb^2}{2} + \\frac{p^2b^2}{2}\\right)t\\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_p = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\left[\\frac{p\\ln(X_0)}{t} + pa - \\frac{pb^2}{2} + \\frac{p^2b^2}{2}\\right]\n$$\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{p\\ln(X_0)}{t}$ vanishes. This yields the explicit expression for $\\lambda_p$:\n$$\n\\lambda_p = pa - \\frac{pb^2}{2} + \\frac{p^2b^2}{2}\n$$\nThis expression can be rearranged as a quadratic in $p$:\n$$\n\\lambda_p = \\frac{b^2}{2}p^2 + \\left(a - \\frac{b^2}{2}\\right)p\n$$\nThe condition for the $p$-th moment to be asymptotically stable is $\\lambda_p  0$. We must solve this inequality for $p  0$:\n$$\n\\frac{b^2}{2}p^2 + \\left(a - \\frac{b^2}{2}\\right)p  0\n$$\nSince $p0$, we can divide the inequality by $p$ without changing its direction:\n$$\n\\frac{b^2}{2}p + a - \\frac{b^2}{2}  0\n$$\nSolving for $p$:\n$$\n\\frac{b^2}{2}p  \\frac{b^2}{2} - a\n$$\nSince $b \\neq 0$, $b^2  0$, and we can divide by $\\frac{b^2}{2}$ without affecting the inequality:\n$$\np  \\frac{\\frac{b^2}{2} - a}{\\frac{b^2}{2}} = 1 - \\frac{a}{\\frac{b^2}{2}} = 1 - \\frac{2a}{b^2}\n$$\nThe problem states that $\\lambda_p  0$ if and only if $0  p  p_{\\star}$. Combining our result $p  1 - \\frac{2a}{b^2}$ with the given condition $p0$, we find the interval for stability to be $0  p  1 - \\frac{2a}{b^2}$.\nThis implies that the critical exponent $p_{\\star}$ must be:\n$$\np_{\\star} = 1 - \\frac{2a}{b^2}\n$$\nThe problem includes the assumption $a  \\frac{b^2}{2}$. This is equivalent to $2a  b^2$, or $\\frac{2a}{b^2}  1$.
