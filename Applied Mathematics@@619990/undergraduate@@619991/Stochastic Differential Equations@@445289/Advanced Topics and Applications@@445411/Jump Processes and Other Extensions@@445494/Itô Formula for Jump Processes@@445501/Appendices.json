A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities related to the compound Poisson process $X_t$: its random jump measure $\\mu^X(\\mathrm{d}t,\\mathrm{d}z)$ and the associated compensator $\\nu^X(\\mathrm{d}t,\\mathrm{d}z)$.\n\n**1. Expression for the Random Measure $\\mu^X(\\mathrm{d}t,\\mathrm{d}z)$**\n\nThe compound Poisson process $X_t = \\sum_{k=1}^{N_t} J_k$ is a pure jump process. Its jumps are entirely determined by the jumps of the underlying Poisson process $\\{N_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ and the associated marks $\\{J_k\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$.\n\nLet $T_k$ be the time of the $k$-th jump of the Poisson process $N_t$. By definition, $N_t$ is constant between these jump times. Consequently, $X_t$ is also constant between these times. The jumps of $X_t$ can only occur at the times $\\{T_k\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$.\n\nLet's determine the size of the jump of $X_t$ at time $T_k$. The jump is given by $\\Delta X_{T_k} = X_{T_k} - X_{T_k-}$.\nAt time $T_k$, the Poisson process $N_t$ jumps from $k-1$ to $k$, so $N_{T_k} = k$.\nJust before the jump at $T_k$, for any $\\epsilon  0$ small enough, $t \\in [T_k-\\epsilon, T_k)$, we have $N_t = k-1$.\nThus, $X_{T_k-} = \\lim_{s \\uparrow T_k} X_s = \\lim_{s \\uparrow T_k} \\sum_{i=1}^{N_s} J_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} J_i$.\nAt the jump time $T_k$, the value of the process is $X_{T_k} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{T_k}} J_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} J_i$.\nThe jump size is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta X_{T_k} = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k} J_i\\right) - \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} J_i\\right) = J_k\n$$\nThis shows that the jumps of the process $X_t$ occur at the random times $T_1, T_2, \\dots$ and have the corresponding random sizes $J_1, J_2, \\dots$. The set of jumps of $X_t$ is the set of points $\\{(T_k, J_k)\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ in the space-time plane $(0,\\infty) \\times (\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\})$.\n\nThe random jump measure $\\mu^X$ is a counting measure that records these jumps. For any Borel set $A \\subset (0,\\infty) \\times (\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\})$, $\\mu^X(A)$ counts the number of jumps $(T_k, J_k)$ that fall into $A$. Such a measure can be formally expressed as a sum of Dirac delta measures, where each delta measure corresponds to a single jump event.\n\nTherefore, the explicit expression for the random measure $\\mu^X(\\mathrm{d}t,\\mathrm{d}z)$ is:\n$$\n\\mu^X(\\mathrm{d}t,\\mathrm{d}z) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\delta_{(T_k, J_k)}(\\mathrm{d}t, \\mathrm{d}z)\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_{(t_0, z_0)}$ is the Dirac measure centered at the point $(t_0, z_0)$.\n\n**2. Expression for the Compensator $\\nu^X(\\mathrm{d}t,\\mathrm{d}z)$**\n\nThe compensator $\\nu^X(\\mathrm{d}t,\\mathrm{d}z)$ of a random measure $\\mu^X(\\mathrm{d}t,\\mathrm{d}z)$ is the unique predictable measure such that for any suitable non-negative predictable process $\\phi(t,z)$, the process $M_t = \\int_0^t \\int_{\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\phi(s,z) (\\mu^X(\\mathrm{d}s, \\mathrm{d}z) - \\nu^X(\\mathrm{d}s, \\mathrm{d}z))$ is an $\\{\\mathcal{F}_t\\}$-martingale.\n\nA key property that defines the compensator is that it represents the conditional expected rate of jumps. Let $A = (t, t+\\mathrm{d}t] \\times B$, where $B$ is a Borel set in $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. Then, informally, $\\nu^X(\\mathrm{d}t, B) = \\mathbb{E}[\\mu^X((t, t+\\mathrm{d}t] \\times B) | \\mathcal{F}_t]$.\n\nFor a compound Poisson process, the intensity of jumps is independent of the past. The arrival rate of jumps is governed by the Poisson process $N_t$, which has a constant intensity $\\lambda$. The sizes of the jumps are i.i.d. with distribution $F$ and are independent of the jump times. Due to this independence, the compensator will be a deterministic measure, which is trivially predictable.\n\nTo find the form of $\\nu^X$, let us compute the expectation of $\\mu^X$ on a test set $(0,t] \\times B$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mu^X\\big((0,t] \\times B\\big)\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{0s \\le t} \\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\Delta X_s \\in B\\}}\\right]\n$$\nUsing the result from part 1, this is equivalent to:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\mathbf{1}_{\\{T_k \\le t\\}} \\mathbf{1}_{\\{J_k \\in B\\}}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{k=1}^{N_t} \\mathbf{1}_{\\{J_k \\in B\\}}\\right]\n$$\nWe compute this expectation using the law of total expectation by conditioning on $N_t$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{k=1}^{N_t} \\mathbf{1}_{\\{J_k \\in B\\}} \\bigg| N_t\\right]\\right]\n$$\nGiven $N_t = n$, the inner expectation is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\mathbf{1}_{\\{J_k \\in B\\}} \\bigg| N_t=n\\right]\n$$\nSince the marks $\\{J_k\\}$ are independent of the process $\\{N_t\\}$, conditioning on $N_t=n$ does not affect the distribution of the $J_k$. By linearity of expectation:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbf{1}_{\\{J_k \\in B\\}}\\right] = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\mathbb{P}(J_k \\in B)\n$$\nAs the $J_k$ are i.i.d. with distribution $F$, we have $\\mathbb{P}(J_k \\in B) = F(B)$, where $F(B) = \\int_B F(\\mathrm{d}z)$.\nThus, the inner expectation is $n F(B)$. Substituting this back into the outer expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[N_t F(B)\\right] = F(B) \\mathbb{E}[N_t]\n$$\nFor a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda$, we know that $\\mathbb{E}[N_t] = \\lambda t$.\nSo, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mu^X\\big((0,t] \\times B\\big)\\right] = \\lambda t F(B)\n$$\nWe are looking for a measure $\\nu^X$ such that for any $t$ and $B$, $\\int_0^t \\int_B \\nu^X(\\mathrm{d}s, \\mathrm{d}z) = \\lambda t F(B)$.\nLet's propose the product measure form $\\nu^X(\\mathrm{d}t, \\mathrm{d}z) = c \\, \\mathrm{d}t \\, G(\\mathrm{d}z)$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_0^t \\int_B c \\, \\mathrm{d}s \\, G(\\mathrm{d}z) = c \\left(\\int_0^t \\mathrm{d}s\\right) \\left(\\int_B G(\\mathrm{d}z)\\right) = c t G(B)\n$$\nComparing this with $\\lambda t F(B)$, we directly identify $c=\\lambda$ and the measure $G$ with the mark distribution measure $F$.\nThus, the compensator is a deterministic product measure given by:\n$$\n\\nu^X(\\mathrm{d}t,\\mathrm{d}z) = \\lambda \\mathrm{d}t F(\\mathrm{d}z)\n$$\nThis measure is deterministic, and therefore predictable. It is composed of a time component, $\\lambda \\mathrm{d}t$, representing the constant intensity of jumps in time, and a mark component, $F(\\mathrm{d}z)$, representing the distribution of jump sizes.

The process $X_t$ has a continuous martingale part given by $\\int_0^t \\sigma(X_{s-})\\,\\mathrm{d}W_s$.\n\nFirst, as requested, we identify the contributions to the quadratic variation.\n1.  **Continuous Martingale Contribution:** The quadratic variation of the continuous martingale part, $M_t^c = \\int_0^t \\sigma(X_{s-})\\,\\mathrm{d}W_s$, is given by $[X,X]_t^c = [M^c,M^c]_t = \\int_0^t \\sigma^2(X_{s-})\\,\\mathrm{d}s$. In differential form, this is:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{d}[X,X]_t^c = \\sigma^2(X_{t-})\\,\\mathrm{d}t\n    $$\n2.  **Pure-Jump Contribution:** The jumps of the process $X_t$ at time $t$ are given by $\\Delta X_t = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\gamma(X_{t-},z) N(\\{t\\}, \\mathrm{d}z)$. The quadratic variation from the jumps is the sum of the squares of these jumps, $[X,X]_t^d = \\sum_{0s\\le t} (\\Delta X_s)^2$. This can be expressed as an integral with respect to the Poisson random measure:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{d}[X,X]_t^d = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\gamma^2(X_{t-},z) N(\\mathrm{d}t,\\mathrm{d}z)\n    $$\nThe compensator of this jump quadratic variation process is $\\langle X^d, X^d \\rangle_t = \\int_0^t \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\gamma^2(X_{s-},z) \\nu(\\mathrm{d}z)\\,\\mathrm{d}s$, which in differential form is $\\mathrm{d}\\langle X^d, X^d \\rangle_t = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\gamma^2(X_{t-},z) \\nu(\\mathrm{d}z)\\,\\mathrm{d}t$.\n\nNow we apply Itô's formula to $f(x)=x^2$. We compute each term in the formula.\n\n- **Term 1:** $f'(X_{t-})\\, \\mathrm{d}X_t^{\\text{cont}} = 2X_{t-}(b(X_{t-})\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma(X_{t-})\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t)$.\n- **Term 2:** $\\frac{1}{2} f''(X_{t-})\\, \\mathrm{d}[X,X]_t^c = \\frac{1}{2}(2)\\sigma^2(X_{t-})\\,\\mathrm{d}t = \\sigma^2(X_{t-})\\,\\mathrm{d}t$. This term arises directly from the continuous martingale contribution to the quadratic variation.\n- **Term 3 (Jump Martingale):** The integrand is $f(X_{t-} + \\gamma(X_{t-},z)) - f(X_{t-}) = (X_{t-}+\\gamma(X_{t-},z))^2 - X_{t-}^2 = 2X_{t-}\\gamma(X_{t-},z) + \\gamma^2(X_{t-},z)$. The full term is:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\left( 2X_{t-}\\gamma(X_{t-},z) + \\gamma^2(X_{t-},z) \\right) \\tilde{N}(\\mathrm{d}t,\\mathrm{d}z) $$\n- **Term 4 (Jump compensator contribution to drift):** The integrand is $f(X_{t-} + \\gamma(X_{t-},z)) - f(X_{t-}) - f'(X_{t-})\\gamma(X_{t-},z) = (X_{t-}+\\gamma(X_{t-},z))^2 - X_{t-}^2 - 2X_{t-}\\gamma(X_{t-},z) = \\gamma^2(X_{t-},z)$. The full term is:\n$$ \\left( \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\gamma^2(X_{t-},z) \\nu(\\mathrm{d}z) \\right) \\mathrm{d}t $$\nThis term can be interpreted as the contribution to the drift from the second-order effect of the jumps, and it is built from the compensator of the pure-jump quadratic variation.\n\nCombining all terms, we get the expression for $\\mathrm{d}(X_t^2)$. We group the terms by their differential type ($\\mathrm{d}t$, $\\mathrm{d}W_t$, $\\tilde{N}(\\mathrm{d}t,\\mathrm{d}z)$).\n\n- **Drift part (coefficient of $\\mathrm{d}t$):** This combines the original drift from $X_t$ (multiplied by $f'$), the Itô correction from the continuous part, and the Itô correction from the jump part.\n$$\n2X_{t-}b(X_{t-}) + \\sigma^2(X_{t-}) + \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\gamma^2(X_{t-},z) \\nu(\\mathrm{d}z)\n$$\n- **Continuous martingale part (coefficient of $\\mathrm{d}W_t$):**\n$$\n2X_{t-}\\sigma(X_{t-})\n$$\n- **Pure-jump martingale part (integrand for $\\tilde{N}(\\mathrm{d}t,\\mathrm{d}z)$):**\n$$\n2X_{t-}\\gamma(X_{t-},z) + \\gamma^2(X_{t-},z)\n$$\nAssembling these components gives the final SDE for $X_t^2$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}(X_t^2) = \\left( 2X_{t-}b(X_{t-}) + \\sigma^2(X_{t-}) + \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\gamma^2(X_{t-},z) \\nu(\\mathrm{d}z) \\right) \\mathrm{d}t \\\\\n+ 2X_{t-}\\sigma(X_{t-})\\mathrm{d}W_t \\\\\n+ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\left( 2X_{t-}\\gamma(X_{t-},z) + \\gamma^2(X_{t-},z) \\right) \\tilde{N}(\\mathrm{d}t,\\mathrm{d}z)\n$$\nThis is the complete expression for the differential $\\mathrm{d}(X_t^2)$ in the standard canonical form for a jump-diffusion process.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left( 2X_{t-}b(X_{t-}) + \\sigma^2(X_{t-}) + \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\gamma^2(X_{t-},z) \\nu(\\mathrm{d}z) \\right) \\mathrm{d}t + 2X_{t-}\\sigma(X_{t-})\\mathrm{d}W_t + \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\left( 2X_{t-}\\gamma(X_{t-},z) + \\gamma^2(X_{t-},z) \\right) \\tilde{N}(\\mathrm{d}t,\\mathrm{d}z)}$$", "id": "3062569"}]}
