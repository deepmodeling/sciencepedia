No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires us to analyze the domain of integration for the mild solution of the one-dimensional stochastic wave equation. The mild solution at a fixed point $(t,x)$ is given by the stochastic convolution:\n$$\nu(t,x) = \\int_{0}^{t}\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} G_{c}(t-s,x-y)\\,\\sigma(s,y)\\,W(\\mathrm{d}s,\\mathrm{d}y)\n$$\nThe task is to determine the effective domain of this integral in the $(s,y)$-plane, which is defined by the region where the integrand's deterministic part, $G_{c}(t-s,x-y)\\,\\sigma(s,y)$, can be non-zero. Since $\\sigma(s,y)$ is a general bounded, measurable coefficient, we must assume its support can be the entire plane. Therefore, the integration domain is solely determined by the support of the fundamental solution, $G_{c}(t-s,x-y)$.\n\nThe fundamental solution $G_{c}(\\tau,\\xi)$ is defined by the equation $\\partial_{\\tau}^{2} G_{c}(\\tau,\\xi)-c^{2}\\,\\partial_{\\xi}^{2} G_{c}(\\tau,\\xi)=\\delta(\\tau)\\,\\delta(\\xi)$ with the causality condition $G_{c}(\\tau,\\xi)=0$ for $\\tau0$. This represents the response at $(\\tau,\\xi)$ to a point impulse at the origin $(0,0)$.\n\nThe fundamental support property of the one-dimensional wave equation with speed $c$ is that a disturbance originating at a point in spacetime propagates outwards at a speed no greater than $c$. For a source at the origin $(\\tau, \\xi) = (0,0)$, the effect at a later time $\\tau0$ is confined to the spatial region $|\\xi| \\leq c\\tau$. This region is known as the forward light cone of the origin. The causality condition $G_{c}(\\tau,\\xi)=0$ for $\\tau0$ ensures that there is no effect before the cause.\n\nTherefore, the support of the fundamental solution $G_c(\\tau, \\xi)$ is the set of points $(\\tau, \\xi)$ satisfying:\n1. $\\tau \\geq 0$\n2. $|\\xi| \\leq c\\tau$\n\nIn our context, the arguments of the fundamental solution are $\\tau = t-s$ and $\\xi = x-y$. To find the region where $G_{c}(t-s,x-y)$ is non-zero, we apply these conditions:\n1. $t-s \\geq 0 \\implies s \\leq t$.\n2. $|x-y| \\leq c(t-s)$.\n\nAdditionally, the stochastic integral itself is defined for $s$ in the interval $[0,t]$, which means we have the explicit constraint $s \\geq 0$. Combining this with the condition $s \\leq t$ from the support of $G_c$, we get the range for the time variable $s$: $0 \\leq s \\leq t$.\n\nThis answers the first part of the problem. The domain of integration, let's call it $D_{t,x}$, for a fixed point $(t,x)$ with $t0$, is the set of points $(s,y)$ satisfying the inequalities:\n$$\n0 \\leq s \\leq t \\quad \\text{and} \\quad |x-y| \\leq c(t-s)\n$$\nThe second inequality can be expanded as:\n$$\n-c(t-s) \\leq x-y \\leq c(t-s)\n$$\nIsolating $y$, we get the explicit limits for the spatial integration:\n$$\nx - c(t-s) \\leq y \\leq x + c(t-s)\n$$\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we describe the geometry of this domain in the $(s,y)$-plane. The domain $D_{t,x}$ is bounded by the lines:\n- The base line: $s=0$.\n- The upper boundary for $y$: $y = x + c(t-s)$, which is a line $y = -cs + (x+ct)$.\n- The lower boundary for $y$: $y = x - c(t-s)$, which is a line $y = cs + (x-ct)$.\n\nThe region is a triangle. To find its vertices, we find the intersection points of these boundary lines.\n- **Vertex 1**: Intersection of the two slanted lines $y = -cs + (x+ct)$ and $y = cs + (x-ct)$.\nSetting them equal: $-cs + x + ct = cs + x - ct \\implies 2ct = 2cs \\implies s=t$.\nSubstituting $s=t$ into either equation gives $y=x+c(t-t) = x$. Thus, the first vertex is $(t,x)$. This is the apex of the triangle, corresponding to the observation point itself.\n\n- **Vertex 2**: Intersection of the line $s=0$ with the upper boundary $y = -cs + (x+ct)$.\nSubstituting $s=0$ gives $y = x+ct$. The second vertex is $(0, x+ct)$.\n\n- **Vertex 3**: Intersection of the line $s=0$ with the lower boundary $y = cs + (x-ct)$.\nSubstituting $s=0$ gives $y = x-ct$. The third vertex is $(0, x-ct)$.\n\nSo, the domain of integration is a triangle in the $(s,y)$-plane with vertices at $(t,x)$, $(0, x+ct)$, and $(0, x-ct)$. This triangular region is the past light cone of the point $(t,x)$, representing all source points $(s,y)$ that could influence the solution at $(t,x)$.\n\nFor the third part of the problem, we compute the Lebesgue measure (area) of this triangular domain.\nThe base of the triangle lies along the line $s=0$ (the $y$-axis in the $(s,y)$-plane). The length of the base is the distance between the vertices $(0, x+ct)$ and $(0, x-ct)$, which is $|(x+ct) - (x-ct)| = |2ct| = 2ct$ since $c0$ and $t0$.\nThe height of the triangle is the perpendicular distance from the apex vertex $(t,x)$ to the base line $s=0$. This distance is simply $t$.\n\nThe area of a triangle is given by the formula $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$.\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (2ct) \\times t = ct^{2}\n$$\nAlternatively, we can compute the area by direct integration over the domain $D_{t,x}$:\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\iint_{D_{t,x}} 1 \\, \\mathrm{d}s \\, \\mathrm{d}y = \\int_{0}^{t} \\left( \\int_{x-c(t-s)}^{x+c(t-s)} 1 \\, \\mathrm{d}y \\right) \\mathrm{d}s\n$$\nThe inner integral evaluates to:\n$$\n\\int_{x-c(t-s)}^{x+c(t-s)} 1 \\, \\mathrm{d}y = [y]_{y=x-c(t-s)}^{y=x+c(t-s)} = (x+c(t-s)) - (x-c(t-s)) = 2c(t-s)\n$$\nNow, we compute the outer integral:\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\int_{0}^{t} 2c(t-s) \\, \\mathrm{d}s = 2c \\left[ ts - \\frac{s^{2}}{2} \\right]_{0}^{t} = 2c \\left( \\left(t \\cdot t - \\frac{t^{2}}{2}\\right) - (0-0) \\right) = 2c \\left( t^{2} - \\frac{t^{2}}{2} \\right) = 2c \\left( \\frac{t^{2}}{2} \\right) = ct^{2}\n$$\nBoth methods yield the same result.
