The derivation must proceed from the fundamental definitions of a Lévy process and Brownian motion. The final result is to be presented as the Lévy-Itô triplet $(b, \\sigma, \\nu)$.\n\nFirst, we verify that $\\{X_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ is a Lévy process. A Lévy process is a stochastic process with stationary, independent increments and càdlàg paths, starting at $0$.\n\n1.  **Independent Increments**: Let $0 \\le t_0  t_1  \\dots  t_n$ be a sequence of times. The increments of $X_t$ are given by\n    $$X_{t_i} - X_{t_{i-1}} = (\\mu t_i + \\sigma W_{t_i}) - (\\mu t_{i-1} + \\sigma W_{t_{i-1}}) = \\mu(t_i - t_{i-1}) + \\sigma(W_{t_i} - W_{t_{i-1}})$$\n    for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, n$. By definition, a standard Brownian motion $\\{W_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ has independent increments. This means the random variables $\\{W_{t_i} - W_{t_{i-1}}\\}_{i=1}^n$ are mutually independent. Since each increment $X_{t_i} - X_{t_{i-1}}$ is a deterministic shift of a scaled Brownian increment $\\sigma(W_{t_i} - W_{t_{i-1}})$, the increments of $\\{X_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ are also mutually independent.\n\n2.  **Stationary Increments**: For any $s, t \\ge 0$, consider the increment $X_{s+t} - X_s$.\n    $$X_{s+t} - X_s = \\mu((s+t) - s) + \\sigma(W_{s+t} - W_s) = \\mu t + \\sigma(W_{s+t} - W_s)$$\n    By definition, Brownian motion has stationary increments, which means the distribution of $W_{s+t} - W_s$ is the same as the distribution of $W_t - W_0 = W_t$. Both are Gaussian with mean $0$ and variance $t$. That is, $W_{s+t} - W_s \\sim N(0, t)$. Therefore, the increment $X_{s+t} - X_s$ has a distribution given by a linear transformation of a normal random variable. Specifically, $X_{s+t} - X_s \\sim N(\\mu t, \\sigma^2 t)$. Since this distribution depends only on the time difference $t$ and not on $s$, the process $\\{X_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ has stationary increments.\n\n3.  **Càdlàg Paths and Initial Value**: The sample paths of a standard Brownian motion $\\{W_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ are continuous almost surely by definition. The function $t \\mapsto \\mu t$ is a deterministic, continuous function. The process $X_t$ is the sum of these two processes. The sum of two continuous functions is continuous. Therefore, the sample paths of $X_t$ are continuous almost surely. Any continuous path is automatically càdlàg (right-continuous with left limits). Finally, at $t=0$, we have $W_0=0$ a.s., so $X_0 = \\mu \\cdot 0 + \\sigma \\cdot 0 = 0$ a.s.\n\nSince $\\{X_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ satisfies all the defining properties, it is a Lévy process.\n\nThe Lévy-Itô decomposition theorem states that any one-dimensional Lévy process $\\{X_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ has a unique decomposition of the form:\n$$X_t = b t + \\sigma_{L} W'_t + J_t$$\nwhere $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a drift coefficient, $\\sigma_{L} \\ge 0$ is the Gaussian (or diffusion) coefficient, $\\{W'_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ is a standard Brownian motion, and $\\{J_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ is a pure jump process, independent of $\\{W'_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$. The jump process $J_t$ is characterized by a Lévy measure $\\nu$ on $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$, which satisfies the condition $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\min(1, z^2) \\nu(dz)  \\infty$. The characteristics of the Lévy process are given by the triplet $(b, \\sigma_{L}, \\nu)$.\n\nWe now identify these components for the process $X_t = \\mu t + \\sigma W_t$.\n\nThe key to identifying the jump component is the continuity of the paths. The jumps of a process are defined by $\\Delta X_t = X_t - X_{t-}$, where $X_{t-} = \\lim_{s \\to t^-} X_s$. As established above, the paths of $X_t$ are continuous almost surely. For a continuous path, $X_t = X_{t-}$ for all $t  0$. Consequently, the jumps are $\\Delta X_t = 0$ for all $t  0$ almost surely.\n\nThe jump process $J_t$ in the Lévy-Itô decomposition accounts for all non-zero jumps of $X_t$. Since $X_t$ has no jumps, the jump process $J_t$ must be identically zero, i.e., $J_t = 0$ for all $t \\ge 0$. The Lévy measure $\\nu$ determines the intensity and size distribution of the jumps. Specifically, the expected number of jumps with size in a set $A \\subset \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ occurring within the time interval $[0, t]$ is given by $t \\nu(A)$. Since there are no jumps, this expected number must be $0$. This implies that $\\nu(A) = 0$ for all such sets $A$. Thus, the Lévy measure $\\nu$ is the zero measure, which we denote by $\\nu = 0$.\n\nWith the jump component being zero, the Lévy-Itô decomposition for $X_t$ simplifies to:\n$$X_t = b t + \\sigma_{L} W'_t$$\nThis is the general form for any continuous Lévy process.\n\nWe are given that the process is $X_t = \\mu t + \\sigma W_t$. By the uniqueness of the Lévy-Itô decomposition, we can directly compare this given form with the general simplified form.\nThe term $\\mu t$ is a deterministic linear drift. This corresponds to the $b t$ term in the decomposition. Therefore, the drift coefficient is $b = \\mu$.\nThe term $\\sigma W_t$ is the continuous, stochastic part, which is a scaled standard Brownian motion. This corresponds to the $\\sigma_{L} W'_t$ term. Thus, the Gaussian coefficient is $\\sigma_{L} = \\sigma$. The Brownian motion $\\{W_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ in the definition of $X_t$ is the same Brownian motion (up to a sign, but we take $\\sigma \\ge 0$) that appears in its Lévy-Itô decomposition.\n\nIn summary, the three components of the Lévy-Itô triplet $(b, \\sigma, \\nu)$ for the process $X_t = \\mu t + \\sigma W_t$ are:\n-   The drift coefficient, $b = \\mu$.\n-   The Gaussian coefficient, which is the given parameter $\\sigma$.\n-   The Lévy measure, $\\nu = 0$, as the process is continuous.\n\nThe resulting Lévy-Itô triplet is $(\\mu, \\sigma, 0)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\mu  \\sigma  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3081096"}, {"introduction": "Having established the decomposition for a continuous process, we now turn our attention to a process composed entirely of jumps.

The probability that any given jump $J_k$ has its size in $B$ is $\\mathbb{P}(J_k \\in B) = F(B)$, since $F$ is the probability distribution of the jumps.\nBy the properties of thinning a Poisson process, the process of jumps with sizes in $B$ is also a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda \\times \\mathbb{P}(J_k \\in B) = \\lambda F(B)$.\nThe expected number of such jumps up to time $t$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\Big[N\\big((0,t]\\times B\\big)\\Big] = \\big(\\lambda F(B)\\big) t\n$$\nBy equating the two expressions for the expectation, we have:\n$$\nt\\,\\nu(B) = \\lambda t F(B)\n$$\nThis implies that for any Borel set $B \\subset \\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{0\\}$, $\\nu(B) = \\lambda F(B)$.

The variance of an exponential random variable with rate $\\eta$ is $\\mathrm{Var}(Y_1) = 1/\\eta^2$.\n    So, $\\mathrm{Var}(J_t|N_t) = N_t / \\eta^2$. Taking the expectation gives\n    $$\n    \\mathbb{E}[\\mathrm{Var}(J_t|N_t)] = \\mathbb{E}[N_t / \\eta^2] = \\frac{1}{\\eta^2} \\mathbb{E}[N_t] = \\frac{\\lambda t}{\\eta^2}.\n    $$\n2.  **Second term:** $\\mathrm{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[J_t|N_t])$. From the mean calculation, we have $\\mathbb{E}[J_t|N_t] = N_t / \\eta$.\n    The variance of this term is\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[J_t|N_t]) = \\mathrm{Var}(N_t / \\eta) = \\frac{1}{\\eta^2} \\mathrm{Var}(N_t).\n    $$\n    For a Poisson process, $\\mathrm{Var}(N_t) = \\lambda t$. So,\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[J_t|N_t]) = \\frac{\\lambda t}{\\eta^2}.\n    $$\nSumming the two terms, the variance of the jump component is\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N_t} Y_i\\right) = \\frac{\\lambda t}{\\eta^2} + \\frac{\\lambda t}{\\eta^2} = \\frac{2\\lambda t}{\\eta^2}.\n$$\nFinally, summing the variances of the diffusion and jump components gives the total variance of $X_t$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(X_t) = \\sigma^2 t + \\frac{2\\lambda t}{\\eta^2} = \\left(\\sigma^2 + \\frac{2\\lambda}{\\eta^2}\\right)t.\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx_0 + \\left(\\mu + \\frac{\\lambda}{\\eta}\\right)t  \\left(\\sigma^2 + \\frac{2\\lambda}{\\eta^2}\\right)t\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3002113"}]}
