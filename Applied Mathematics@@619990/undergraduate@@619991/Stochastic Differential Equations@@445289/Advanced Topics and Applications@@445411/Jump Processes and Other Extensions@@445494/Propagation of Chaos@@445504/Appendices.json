The positions $X_t^{i,N}$ are random variables, functions from $\\Omega$ to $\\mathbb{R}^d$.

Therefore, $\\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,N})$ is a **deterministic probability measure**.\n\nWith this primary distinction established, we can evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. The empirical measure $\\mu_t^N$ is a random probability measure determined by the realized particle sample, whereas $\\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,N})$ is a deterministic probability measure describing the distribution of a single tagged particle.**\nThis statement precisely captures the fundamental difference between the two objects, as explained above. $\\mu_t^N$ is a measure-valued random variable representing the state of the entire system for a single realization. $\\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,N})$ is the probabilistic law of a single particle, averaged over all possible realizations.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.

It equates a random measure with a deterministic one. For this equality to hold almost surely, the random measure $\\mu_t^N$ must be constant (equal to the deterministic measure $\\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,N})$) for almost all outcomes $\\omega$.

The \"propagation of chaos\" property means two things happen simultaneously as $N \\to \\infty$:\n1. The empirical measure $\\mu_t^N$ converges to a deterministic measure $\\nu_t$. The mode of convergence is weak convergence of measures, in probability. This is a law of large numbers for interacting particles.\n2. The law of any single particle, $\\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,N})$, also converges weakly to the same deterministic measure $\\nu_t$. This means the influence of all other $N-1$ particles on particle $1$ averages out in the limit to be described by the distribution $\\nu_t$.\nThe limit measure $\\nu_t$ is the solution to the McKean–Vlasov equation. Thus, while $\\mu_t^N$ and $\\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,N})$ are distinct for any finite $N$, they share the same deterministic limit as $N \\to \\infty$. The statement accurately captures this asymptotic coincidence.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. For a fixed finite $N$, $\\mu_t^N = \\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,N})$ if and only if the particles are independent and identically distributed.**\nThis is incorrect. First, as established in B, the equality $\\mu_t^N = \\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,N})$ almost never holds for a non-trivial stochastic system because a random measure cannot equal a deterministic one. Second, assuming particles are i.i.d. with law $\\nu_t$ does not lead to this equality. If they are i.i.d., then $\\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,N}) = \\nu_t$. The empirical measure $\\mu_t^N$ is still random. By the Glivenko-Cantelli theorem (a strong law of large numbers for empirical measures), $\\mu_t^N$ converges to $\\nu_t$ almost surely as $N \\to \\infty$, but for finite $N$, $\\mu_t^N \\neq \\nu_t$ almost surely. The condition of being i.i.d. is related to the *limit* behavior, not to an equality at finite $N$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. For $N=1$, the equality $\\mu_t^1=\\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,1})$ holds as probability measures (without taking expectation).**\nThis is incorrect. It is a special case of the same fundamental fallacy seen in options B and E. For $N=1$, the empirical measure is $\\mu_t^1 = \\delta_{X_t^{1,1}}$, which is a random Dirac measure located at the random position of the single particle. The one-particle law is $\\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,1})$, which is the deterministic probability distribution of that particle's position. For example, if $X_t^{1,1}$ is a one-dimensional Brownian motion starting at $0$, then $\\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,1})$ is the Gaussian measure $\\mathcal{N}(0,t)$. A random Dirac mass $\\delta_{X_t^{1,1}}$ is not equal to a fixed Gaussian measure $\\mathcal{N}(0,t)$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "3070909"}, {"introduction": "To prove that the particle system converges to the McKean–Vlasov equation, a powerful technique is to \"couple\" the two systems and show that they stay close.

Using the independence of $X_0$ and $W$, and Itô's isometry, we compute:\n$$ V_t = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(e^{\\gamma t}(X_0 - m_0) + \\sigma \\int_0^t e^{\\gamma(t-s)} dW_s\\right) $$\n$$ V_t = e^{2\\gamma t} \\mathrm{Var}(X_0) + \\sigma^2 \\int_0^t e^{2\\gamma(t-s)} ds $$\n$$ V_t = e^{2\\gamma t} v_0 + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\gamma} (e^{2\\gamma t} - 1) $$\nSince $\\gamma > 0$, both terms in the variance grow exponentially. For large $t$, the variance behaves as $V_t \\sim \\left(v_0 + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\gamma}\\right) e^{2\\gamma t}$. The law $\\mu_t$ of $X_t$ becomes progressively wider as time increases.\n\nNext, consider the $N$-particle system. As noted, the drift $b(x,\\mu)=\\gamma x$ does not depend on $\\mu$. Thus, the SDEs for the particles are uncoupled:\n$$ dX_t^i = \\gamma X_t^i dt + \\sigma dW_t^i, \\quad i=1, \\dots, N $$\nSince the initial conditions $\\{X_0^i\\}_{i=1}^N$ are i.i.d. draws from $\\mu_0$, the random variables $\\{X_t^i\\}_{i=1}^N$ at any time $t$ are i.i.d. draws from the law $\\mu_t = \\mathcal{L}(X_t)$.\n\nThe empirical measure is $\\mu_t^N = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\delta_{X_t^i}$. The question is about the rate of convergence of $\\mu_t^N$ to $\\mu_t$, uniformly in time. A necessary condition for such uniform convergence is that the fluctuations of statistical quantities do not grow unboundedly in time. Let's analyze the fluctuation of the empirical mean $m_t^N$ around the true mean $m_t$. The variance of this fluctuation is:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}\\left[ (m_t^N - m_t)^2 \\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N X_t^i - m_t\\right)^2 \\right] = \\mathrm{Var}\\left( \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N X_t^i \\right) $$\nSince $\\{X_t^i\\}_{i=1}^N$ are i.i.d., the variance of their sum is the sum of their variances:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}\\left( \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N X_t^i \\right) = \\frac{1}{N^2} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\mathrm{Var}(X_t^i) = \\frac{N V_t}{N^2} = \\frac{V_t}{N} $$\nTherefore, the mean squared fluctuation is:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}\\left[ (m_t^N - m_t)^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{N} \\left( e^{2\\gamma t} v_0 + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\gamma} (e^{2\\gamma t} - 1) \\right) $$\nThe standard deviation of the fluctuation scales as $\\sqrt{V_t/N}$, which grows like $e^{\\gamma t}/\\sqrt{N}$.\n\nThe $1$-Wasserstein distance $W_1(\\mu_t^N, \\mu_t)$ is related to these fluctuations. A lower bound is given by the distance between the means: $W_1(\\mu_t^N, \\mu_t) \\ge |m_t^N - m_t|$. Therefore,\n$$ \\mathbb{E}\\left[ W_1(\\mu_t^N, \\mu_t) \\right] \\ge \\mathbb{E}\\left[ |m_t^N - m_t| \\right] $$\nBy Jensen's inequality, $\\mathbb{E}[|Z|] \\le \\sqrt{\\mathbb{E}[Z^2]}$, so an estimate for the scale of the lower bound is $\\sqrt{\\mathbb{E}[(m_t^N - m_t)^2]} = \\sqrt{V_t/N}$, which grows like $e^{\\gamma t}/\\sqrt{N}$. More precise results for i.i.d. random variables in one dimension show that $\\mathbb{E}[W_1(\\mu_t^N, \\mu_t)]$ is of the order $\\sqrt{V_t/N}$.\nAs this quantity grows exponentially in $t$, it is impossible to find a constant $C$ independent of $t$ such that $\\mathbb{E}[W_1(\\mu_t^N, \\mu_t)] \\le C N^{-1/2}$ for all $t \\ge 0$. The factor $C$ must itself grow exponentially with $t$. Thus, time-uniform propagation of chaos fails. The reason is the inherent instability of the dynamics, where the positive drift $\\gamma x$ pushes particles away from the origin exponentially fast.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The drift dynamics are contractive, so deviations decay like $e^{-\\gamma t}$ and one obtains a uniform-in-time bound $\\mathbb{E}\\big[W_1(\\mu_t^N,\\mu_t)\\big] \\leq C N^{-1/2}$ for all $t\\geq 0$.**\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. The drift is $b(x) = \\gamma x$. For two solutions $X_t$ and $Y_t$, their difference $Z_t=X_t-Y_t$ satisfies $dZ_t = \\gamma Z_t dt$, so $Z_t = Z_0 e^{\\gamma t}$. Since $\\gamma > 0$, the distance between trajectories is amplified exponentially, not contracted. The dynamics are expansive. Contractivity would require $\\gamma < 0$.\n\n**B. The drift amplifies deviations exponentially, causing fluctuations of $m_t^N - m_t$ to grow on the scale $e^{\\gamma t}/\\sqrt{N}$, so any bound of the form $\\mathbb{E}\\big[W_1(\\mu_t^N,\\mu_t)\\big] \\leq C N^{-1/2}$ cannot hold uniformly in $t\\geq 0$.**\nThis statement is **Correct**. As demonstrated in the derivation, the drift $b(x) = \\gamma x$ with $\\gamma > 0$ is amplifying. This leads to an exponential growth of the variance $V_t \\sim e^{2\\gamma t}$. The fluctuations of the empirical mean, $m_t^N - m_t$, have a standard deviation that scales as $\\sqrt{V_t/N} \\sim e^{\\gamma t}/\\sqrt{N}$. This exponential growth in time of the fluctuations prevents the existence of a time-uniform bound on the convergence rate.\n\n**C. The diffusion term $\\sigma>0$ neutralizes the unstable drift and yields a time-uniform bound $\\mathbb{E}\\big[W_1(\\mu_t^N,\\mu_t)\\big] \\leq C(\\sigma,\\gamma)N^{-1/2}$, independent of $t$.**\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. The diffusion does not neutralize the instability. On the contrary, the noise injected by the diffusion term is itself amplified by the unstable drift. As shown by the variance calculation, $V_t = e^{2\\gamma t} v_0 + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\gamma} (e^{2\\gamma t} - 1)$, the contribution from diffusion, $\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\gamma} (e^{2\\gamma t} - 1)$, also grows exponentially. Diffusion exacerbates the spread of particles rather than stabilizing the system.\n\n**D. Because $b$ depends on $\\mu$, the particles are dependent at any fixed time and propagation of chaos fails even on finite time intervals, independent of the growth rate $\\gamma$.**\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. The premise is false. The drift is specified as $b(x,\\mu) = \\gamma x$, which explicitly *does not* depend on the measure $\\mu$. Therefore, the particles evolve independently of each other. Because they are independent, propagation of chaos (convergence of the empirical measure to the true law) holds on any finite time interval $[0,T]$. The issue at hand is not the failure of convergence itself, but the lack of a *uniform* rate of convergence for all time $t \\ge 0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "3070911"}]}
