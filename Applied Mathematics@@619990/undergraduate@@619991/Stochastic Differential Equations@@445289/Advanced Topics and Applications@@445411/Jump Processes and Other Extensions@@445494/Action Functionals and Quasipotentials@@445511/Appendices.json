First, we find the canonical momentum $p$ conjugate to the position variable $x$:\n$$p = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\dot{x}} \\left[\\frac{1}{2}(\\dot{x} - b(x))^2\\right] = \\dot{x} - b(x)$$\nWe can express the velocity $\\dot{x}$ in terms of the momentum $p$ and position $x$:\n$$\\dot{x} = p + b(x)$$\nThe Hamiltonian $H(x, p)$ is obtained via the Legendre transformation of the Lagrangian:\n$$H(x, p) = p\\dot{x} - L(x, \\dot{x})$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\dot{x}$ and $L(x, \\dot{x})$:\n$$H(x, p) = p(p + b(x)) - \\frac{1}{2}((p + b(x)) - b(x))^2 = p^2 + p b(x) - \\frac{1}{2}p^2 = \\frac{1}{2}p^2 + p b(x)$$\nThe quasipotential $V(x_a, y)$ is defined as the infimum of the action functional over all positive time durations $T$ and all paths connecting the attractor $x_a$ to the point $y$:\n$$V(x_a, y) = \\inf_{T>0} \\inf_{\\varphi(0)=x_a, \\varphi(T)=y} S_T(\\varphi)$$\nA key result of the theory is that the quasipotential $V(y) \\equiv V(x_a, y)$ satisfies the stationary Hamilton–Jacobi equation. This arises because the infimum over time $T$ requires the Hamiltonian to be zero along the optimal trajectory. The momentum $p$ is related to the gradient of the quasipotential, $p = \\frac{dV}{dy}$. Thus, the stationary Hamilton–Jacobi equation is:\n$$H\\left(y, \\frac{dV}{dy}\\right) = 0$$\nSubstituting our derived Hamiltonian:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{dV}{dy}\\right)^2 + b(y)\\frac{dV}{dy} = 0$$\nNow, we substitute the specific drift term for this problem, $b(y) = -\\lambda y$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{dV}{dy}\\right)^2 - \\lambda y \\frac{dV}{dy} = 0$$\nThis is a first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation for $V(y)$. We can solve it by factoring:\n$$\\frac{dV}{dy} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dV}{dy} - \\lambda y\\right) = 0$$\nThis equation yields two possible solutions for the derivative $\\frac{dV}{dy}$:\n1.  $\\frac{dV}{dy} = 0$\n2.  $\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dV}{dy} - \\lambda y = 0 \\implies \\frac{dV}{dy} = 2\\lambda y$\n\nThe first solution, $\\frac{dV}{dy} = 0$, implies that $V(y)$ is a constant. The quasipotential is defined to be zero at the attractor, so $V(0)=0$. This would lead to the trivial solution $V(y)=0$ for all $y$. This solution represents the action required to reach points by following the time-reversed deterministic flow towards the attractor, which incurs zero cost for this system. However, we are interested in the action required to escape the potential well of the attractor, which is a non-zero cost process. Therefore, we must choose the second, non-trivial solution.\n\nThe second solution is:\n$$\\frac{dV}{dy} = 2\\lambda y$$\nWe solve this differential equation by direct integration with respect to $y$:\n$$V(y) = \\int 2\\lambda y \\, dy = \\lambda y^2 + C$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. To determine $C$, we use the boundary condition that the quasipotential is zero at the starting point, which is the attractor $x_a=0$. Thus, $V(0,0)=0$, which we write as $V(0)=0$.\n$$V(0) = \\lambda (0)^2 + C = 0 \\implies C = 0$$\nTherefore, the explicit closed-form expression for the quasipotential from the attractor at $0$ to a point $y$ is:\n$$V(0, y) = \\lambda y^2$$\nThis result represents the minimum action, or \"cost,\" for the stochastic system to move from the stable equilibrium at $0$ to the point $y$ due to noise, in the limit of small noise intensity $\\varepsilon \\to 0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\lambda y^{2}}$$", "id": "3038674"}, {"introduction": "Building on the specific case of a linear system, this practice explores the deep physical intuition behind the action functional for the broad class of gradient systems, where the drift is derived from a potential $U$.

A key step is to establish a lower bound for the action $I_{T}[\\varphi]$ that depends only on the endpoints of the trajectory.\n\nWe begin by manipulating the integrand. For any two vectors $v, w \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, we have the algebraic identity:\n$$\n\\|v+w\\|^2 = \\|v-w\\|^2 + 4\\langle v, w \\rangle,\n$$\nwhere $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ denotes the Euclidean inner product. This identity is derived from expanding the norms: $\\|v+w\\|^2 = \\langle v+w, v+w \\rangle = \\|v\\|^2 + 2\\langle v,w \\rangle + \\|w\\|^2$ and $\\|v-w\\|^2 = \\|v\\|^2 - 2\\langle v,w \\rangle + \\|w\\|^2$. Subtracting the second from the first gives $4\\langle v,w \\rangle$.\n\nLet us apply this identity to the integrand of the action, with $v = \\dot{\\varphi}(t)$ and $w = \\nabla U(\\varphi(t))$. We obtain:\n$$\n\\left\\|\\dot{\\varphi}(t) + \\nabla U(\\varphi(t))\\right\\|^{2} = \\left\\|\\dot{\\varphi}(t) - \\nabla U(\\varphi(t))\\right\\|^{2} + 4\\langle \\dot{\\varphi}(t), \\nabla U(\\varphi(t)) \\rangle.\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $I_{T}[\\varphi]$ yields:\n$$\nI_{T}[\\varphi] = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{T} \\left( \\left\\|\\dot{\\varphi}(t) - \\nabla U(\\varphi(t))\\right\\|^{2} + 4\\langle \\dot{\\varphi}(t), \\nabla U(\\varphi(t)) \\rangle \\right) \\mathrm{d}t.\n$$\nWe can split this into two integrals:\n$$\nI_{T}[\\varphi] = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{T} \\left\\|\\dot{\\varphi}(t) - \\nabla U(\\varphi(t))\\right\\|^{2} \\mathrm{d}t + 2\\int_{0}^{T} \\langle \\dot{\\varphi}(t), \\nabla U(\\varphi(t)) \\rangle \\mathrm{d}t.\n$$\nThe second term can be evaluated precisely using the chain rule. For a smooth function $U$ and a differentiable path $\\varphi(t)$, the time derivative of the composite function $U(\\varphi(t))$ is\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}U(\\varphi(t)) = \\langle \\nabla U(\\varphi(t)), \\dot{\\varphi}(t) \\rangle.\n$$\nTherefore, the second integral is an exact differential:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} \\langle \\dot{\\varphi}(t), \\nabla U(\\varphi(t)) \\rangle \\mathrm{d}t = \\int_{0}^{T} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}U(\\varphi(t)) \\mathrm{d}t = U(\\varphi(T)) - U(\\varphi(0)).\n$$\nGiven the boundary conditions of the path, $\\varphi(0)=x_{a}$ and $\\varphi(T)=x_{s}$, this becomes $U(x_{s}) - U(x_{a})$.\n\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the action, we find:\n$$\nI_{T}[\\varphi] = 2\\left(U(x_{s}) - U(x_{a})\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{T} \\left\\|\\dot{\\varphi}(t) - \\nabla U(\\varphi(t))\\right\\|^{2} \\mathrm{d}t.\n$$\nThe integrand $\\left\\|\\dot{\\varphi}(t) - \\nabla U(\\varphi(t))\\right\\|^{2}$ is a squared norm, so it is non-negative for all $t$.

This, in turn, requires the integrand to be identically zero, meaning the path must satisfy the ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varphi}^*(t) = \\nabla U(\\varphi^*(t)).\n$$\nThis deterministic equation describes a motion that follows the gradient of the potential $U$, i.e., an \"uphill\" trajectory. The original stochastic system's drift, $-\\nabla U$, drives the system \"downhill\". The optimal escape path is therefore the time-reversal of the deterministic trajectory under the system's own drift.\nThe specific path that minimizes the action is the trajectory of $\\dot{\\varphi} = \\nabla U(\\varphi)$ that connects $x_a$ to $x_s$. Since $x_a$ is a minimum of $U$, it is an unstable fixed point of this uphill dynamics ($\\nabla U(x_a)=0$). The saddle point $x_s$ is also a fixed point. The required path is a heteroclinic orbit connecting $x_a$ to $x_s$, which takes an infinite amount of time. Therefore, no path over a finite interval $[0, T]$ can make the integral exactly zero. However, by taking the limit $T\\to\\infty$, one can construct a sequence of paths that approximate this heteroclinic orbit ever more closely, causing the integral term to approach zero. Thus, the infimum of the action $I_T[\\varphi]$ over all paths and all $T>0$ is precisely the lower bound we derived.\n$$\nV(x_{a}, x_{s}) = 2\\left(U(x_{s}) - U(x_{a})\\right).\n$$\nThis concludes the derivation for the $\\alpha=1$ case.\n\nNow we address how the prefactor arises from the specific noise convention.

If we repeat our derivation with this general form, the chain rule term remains the same, but the coefficients change.\n$$\nI_{T}[\\varphi] = \\frac{1}{2\\alpha}\\int_{0}^{T} \\left( \\left\\|\\dot{\\varphi} - \\nabla U\\right\\|^{2} + 4\\langle \\dot{\\varphi}, \\nabla U \\rangle \\right) \\mathrm{d}t.\n$$\n$$\nI_{T}[\\varphi] = \\frac{1}{2\\alpha}\\int_{0}^{T} \\left\\|\\dot{\\varphi} - \\nabla U\\right\\|^{2} \\mathrm{d}t + \\frac{4}{2\\alpha}\\int_{0}^{T} \\langle \\dot{\\varphi}, \\nabla U \\rangle \\mathrm{d}t.\n$$\n$$\nI_{T}[\\varphi] = \\frac{2}{\\alpha}\\left(U(x_{s}) - U(x_{a})\\right) + \\frac{1}{2\\alpha}\\int_{0}^{T} \\left\\|\\dot{\\varphi} - \\nabla U\\right\\|^{2} \\mathrm{d}t.\n$$\nThe minimal action is therefore $V(x_{a}, x_{s}) = \\frac{2}{\\alpha}(U(x_{s}) - U(x_{a}))$.\n\nThe parameter $\\alpha$ is set by the noise amplitude convention.\n1.  **Convention $\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}$:** The noise term is $\\sqrt{\\alpha\\varepsilon}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t = \\sqrt{\\varepsilon}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$. This implies $\\alpha=1$. In this case, $V(x_{a}, x_{s}) = \\frac{2}{1}(U(x_{s}) - U(x_{a})) = 2(U(x_{s}) - U(x_{a}))$. The factor of $2$ arises directly from this convention. The $4$ in the algebraic identity is divided by $2\\alpha = 2$.\n\n2.  **Convention $\\sqrt{2\\varepsilon}$:** The noise term is $\\sqrt{\\alpha\\varepsilon}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t = \\sqrt{2\\varepsilon}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$.

This is a common convention in physics literature, as it simplifies the final expression for the potential barrier to be just the difference in potential energy.\n\nThe choice of $\\alpha$ is a matter of notational convention, but it is critical to be consistent.

The solution will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Minimum Action Method\n\nAccording to the Freidlin-Wentzell theory, for small $\\varepsilon$, the probability of the process $X_t$ following a specific path $\\phi_t$ is exponentially small, governed by an action functional $S_T[\\phi]$. The probability is maximized for the path that minimizes this action. This path is called the \"most probable path\" or \"instanton\".\n\nThe action functional for a path $\\phi:[0,T]\\to\\mathbb{R}^d$ is given by:\n$$\nS_T[\\phi] \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^T L(\\phi(t), \\dot{\\phi}(t))\\,\\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nwhere $L$ is the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian is derived from the \"cost\" of forcing the stochastic system to follow the deterministic trajectory $\\phi(t)$. This cost is determined by the mismatch between the desired velocity $\\dot{\\phi}(t)$ and the drift velocity $b(\\phi(t))$, measured in a metric defined by the inverse of the covariance matrix of the noise.\n\nThe covariance matrix of the noise term $\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}\\,\\sigma(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$ is $\\varepsilon\\,\\sigma(X_t)\\sigma(X_t)^\\top\\,\\mathrm{d}t$. We define the diffusion tensor as $a(x) = \\sigma(x)\\sigma(x)^\\top$. The problem states that $a(x)$ is positive definite, so its inverse $a(x)^{-1}$ exists and is also positive definite.\n\nThe Lagrangian $L(x, v)$ for a state $x$ and velocity $v$ is the squared Mahalanobis distance between $v$ and $b(x)$, with the covariance matrix being $a(x)$:\n$$\nL(x, v) \\;=\\; (v - b(x))^\\top a(x)^{-1} (v - b(x))\n$$\nThus, the continuous action functional for a path $\\phi_t$ from $x_A$ at $t=0$ to $x_B$ at $t=T$ is:\n$$\nS_T[\\phi] \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^T \\left(\\dot{\\phi}(t) - b(\\phi(t))\\right)^\\top a(\\phi(t))^{-1} \\left(\\dot{\\phi}(t) - b(\\phi(t))\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nThe Minimum Action Method (MAM) finds the minimizer of this functional numerically. This is done by discretizing the path and the functional.\n\nLet the time interval $[0, T]$ be discretized into $N$ segments of length $\\Delta t = T/N$, with time points $t_k = k\\,\\Delta t$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, N$. The path $\\phi(t)$ is represented by a sequence of points $\\{x_k\\}_{k=0}^N$, where $x_k \\approx \\phi(t_k)$. The boundary conditions are fixed: $x_0 = x_A$ and $x_N = x_B$.\n\nThe integral is approximated by a sum, and the derivative $\\dot{\\phi}(t)$ is approximated by a finite difference. Using the forward Euler-Maruyama convention for the SDE suggests a simple forward difference for the derivative and evaluating the drift and diffusion at the start of each interval:\n*   $\\dot{\\phi}(t_k) \\approx \\frac{x_{k+1}-x_k}{\\Delta t}$\n*   The integral $\\int_0^T f(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t \\approx \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} f(t_k)\\,\\Delta t$\n\nSubstituting these approximations into the continuous action functional yields the discrete action $S_\\Delta$:\n$$\nS_\\Delta(\\{x_k\\}) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\left(\\frac{x_{k+1}-x_k}{\\Delta t}-b(x_k)\\right)^\\top a(x_k)^{-1}\\,\\left(\\frac{x_{k+1}-x_k}{\\Delta t}-b(x_k)\\right)\\,\\Delta t\n$$\nThe MAM consists of finding the set of intermediate path points $\\{x_k\\}_{k=1}^{N-1}$ that minimizes this discrete action $S_\\Delta$, holding the endpoints $x_0 = x_A$ and $x_N = x_B$ fixed. This is a high-dimensional nonlinear optimization problem, typically solved using gradient-based methods (like gradient descent, conjugate gradient, or L-BFGS). The algorithm requires an initial guess for the path (e.g., a straight line) and terminates based on criteria such as the norm of the gradient or the change in the action value.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**Option A**\nThis option proposes a discrete action:\n$$\nS_\\Delta(\\{x_k\\}) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\Delta t \\,\\Big(\\frac{x_{k+1}-x_k}{\\Delta t}-b(x_k)\\Big)^\\top a(x_k)^{-1}\\,\\Big(\\frac{x_{k+1}-x_k}{\\Delta t}-b(x_k)\\Big)\n$$\nwith $a(x)=\\sigma(x)\\sigma(x)^\\top$. This expression is precisely the discrete action functional derived above. The proposed procedure—minimizing this action over the internal points $\\{x_k\\}_{k=1}^{N-1}$ while keeping endpoints fixed, using a gradient-based optimizer, and employing standard initialization and termination criteria—is an exact description of the standard Minimum Action Method. The optional regularization is also a common practical enhancement.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B**\nThis option proposes minimizing $E_\\Delta(\\{x_k\\}) \\;=\\; \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\frac{\\|x_{k+1}-x_k\\|^2}{\\Delta t}$. This is a discretization of the functional $\\int_0^T \\|\\dot{\\phi}(t)\\|^2 \\mathrm{d}t$. This corresponds to a special case of the FW action functional where the drift $b(x)$ is zero and the diffusion tensor $a(x)$ is the identity matrix. The problem is stated for a general, non-zero drift $b(x)$ and a general, state-dependent diffusion tensor $a(x)$. This option incorrectly ignores both of these crucial components. Its minimizer is simply a straight line, which is not the most probable path in the general case.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C**\nThis option describes a direct simulation (Monte Carlo) approach. One simulates many SDE paths and post-selects those that happen to fulfill the boundary conditions. This is not the Minimum Action Method, which is a deterministic variational method. Furthermore, for small $\\varepsilon$, the transition from $x_A$ to $x_B$ is a rare event, making this naive sampling approach computationally infeasible. The condition \"conditioned to end at $x_B$\" is non-trivial and hides immense complexity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option D**\nThis option proposes a discrete action:\n$$\n\\tilde{S}_\\Delta(\\{x_k\\}) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\Delta t \\,\\Big(\\frac{x_{k+1}-x_k}{\\Delta t}-b(x_k)\\Big)^\\top a(x_k)\\,\\Big(\\frac{x_{k+1}-x_k}{\\Delta t}-b(x_k)\\Big)\n$$\nThe key error here is the use of the diffusion tensor $a(x_k)$ instead of its inverse, $a(x_k)^{-1}$. The Lagrangian penalizes deviations from the drift according to the metric defined by the *inverse* of the noise covariance. A large diffusion coefficient (large $a(x)$) implies that large fluctuations are more likely, and thus deviations from the drift are less \"expensive.\" This translates to a smaller penalty, which requires the inverse $a(x)^{-1}$. This option has the weighting inverted.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option E**\nThis option presents two material errors. First, it proposes minimizing:\n$$\nJ_\\Delta(\\{x_k\\}) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\Delta t \\,\\Big\\|\\frac{x_{k+1}-x_k}{\\Delta t}-b(x_k)\\Big\\|^2 + \\dots\n$$\nThe use of the squared Euclidean norm $\\|\\cdot\\|^2$ is equivalent to setting the diffusion tensor $a(x)$ to the identity matrix, which is incorrect for a general state-dependent diffusion $\\sigma(x)$. Second, it treats the boundary conditions as soft constraints via a penalty term. While this is a valid numerical technique for some problems, the standard MAM for finding the most probable path *between* two fixed points enforces these as hard constraints. The problem statement explicitly specifies fixed endpoint constraints.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3038675"}]}
