The crucial feature of this conclusion is that the limiting dynamic is independent of the initial state $Y_0$.\n\nLet's analyze the ergodicity of the fast process $Y_s$. A probability measure $\\mu$ on the state space $S=\\{-1,1\\}$ is invariant if, for any bounded measurable function $\\phi$, the relation $\\int_S (P_s \\phi)(y) \\mu(dy) = \\int_S \\phi(y) \\mu(dy)$ holds, where $P_s$ is the transition semigroup. For our process, $Y_s=Y_0$, the semigroup is the identity operator, $(P_s \\phi)(y) = \\mathbb{E}[\\phi(Y_s)|Y_0=y] = \\phi(y)$. The invariance condition becomes a tautology, $\\int_S \\phi(y) \\mu(dy) = \\int_S \\phi(y) \\mu(dy)$. This means *any* probability measure on $S=\\{-1,1\\}$ is an invariant measure.\n\nThe set of all probability measures on $\\{-1,1\\}$ is the family $\\{\\mu_p = p\\delta_1 + (1-p)\\delta_{-1} \\mid p \\in [0,1]\\}$, where $\\delta_y$ is the Dirac measure at $y$. Since there is more than one invariant measure, the process is not ergodic by definition.\n\nThe failure of the unique ergodicity assumption is the core reason for the failure of the standard averaging conclusion. Instead of a single averaged behavior, the system's limit depends on which \"ergodic component\" the process starts in. The state space $S$ decomposes into two disjoint, invariant (and hence ergodic) sets: $\\{1\\}$ and $\\{-1\\}$.\n- If $Y_0=1$, the process lives on the set $\\{1\\}$, for which the unique invariant measure is $\\delta_1$. The effective averaged drift is $\\bar{f}_1 = \\int_S y \\, \\delta_1(dy) = 1$. The limit of $X_T^{\\varepsilon}$ is then $1 \\cdot T = T$.\n- If $Y_0=-1$, the process lives on $\\{-1\\}$, for which the unique invariant measure is $\\delta_{-1}$. The effective averaged drift is $\\bar{f}_{-1} = \\int_S y \\, \\delta_{-1}(dy) = -1$. The limit of $X_T^{\\varepsilon}$ is then $(-1) \\cdot T = -T$.\n\nOur direct calculation confirms this: the limit of the slow variable is indeed dependent on the initial state of the fast variable, which contradicts the prediction of a single, universal limiting dynamic that would arise from a uniquely ergodic fast process.

Invariant Distribution of the Fast Variable**\n\nFirst, we identify the stationary distribution of the fast variable $y_t^\\varepsilon$, assuming the slow variable $x_t^\\varepsilon$ is \"frozen\" at a fixed value $x$. The SDE for $y_t^\\varepsilon$ becomes:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}y_{t} = -\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\left(y_{t} - x\\right)\\mathrm{d}t + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}}\\,\\mathrm{d}B_{t}\n$$\nThis is the SDE for an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process.

The stationary or invariant distribution of such a process is a Gaussian distribution $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\frac{\\eta^2}{2\\theta})$.\n\nSubstituting the parameters for our process, the mean of the invariant distribution is $x$. The variance is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\eta^2}{2\\theta} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}}\\right)^2}{2\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{\\varepsilon}}{\\frac{2}{\\varepsilon}} = 1\n$$\nThus, for a fixed $x$, the invariant distribution of the fast variable $y$, denoted by $\\pi_x(y)$, is a normal distribution with mean $x$ and variance $1$:\n$$\n\\pi_x(y) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(x, 1)\n$$\nThe probability density function is $p(y|x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(y-x)^2}{2}\\right)$.

Averaging the Stratonovich Equation and Converting to Itô Form**\n\nThe stochastic averaging principle for Stratonovich SDEs states that as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, the slow process $x_t^\\varepsilon$ converges in distribution to a process $\\bar{x}_t$ whose dynamics are governed by an SDE where the coefficients are averaged with respect to the invariant measure of the fast process.\n\nThe slow variable equation is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}x_{t}^{\\varepsilon} = y_{t}^{\\varepsilon}\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma\\,x_{t}^{\\varepsilon} \\circ \\mathrm{d}W_{t}\n$$\nThe drift term is $f(x,y) = y$ and the diffusion term is $g(x) = \\sigma x$. The averaged drift coefficient $\\bar{f}_S(x)$ is the expectation of $f(x,y)$ with respect to $\\pi_x(y)$:\n$$\n\\bar{f}_S(x) = E_{\\pi_x}[Y] = x\n$$\nThe diffusion coefficient $\\sigma x$ does not depend on the fast variable, so it remains unchanged. The resulting averaged equation in Stratonovich form is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\bar{x}_{t} = x\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma\\,x \\circ \\mathrm{d}W_{t}\n$$\nNext, we convert this averaged Stratonovich SDE to its equivalent Itô form. For a general SDE $\\mathrm{d}X_t = a(X_t)\\mathrm{d}t + b(X_t) \\circ \\mathrm{d}W_t$, the equivalent Itô form is $\\mathrm{d}X_t = \\left(a(X_t) + \\frac{1}{2} b'(X_t)b(X_t)\\right)\\mathrm{d}t + b(X_t)\\mathrm{d}W_t$.\n\nIn our case, $a(x) = x$ and $b(x) = \\sigma x$. The derivative of $b(x)$ with respect to $x$ is $b'(x) = \\sigma$. The Itô correction term is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} b'(x)b(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma (\\sigma x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 x\n$$\nThe Itô form of the averaged equation is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\bar{x}_{t} = \\left(x + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 x\\right)\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma\\,x\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{t}\n$$\nThe averaged Itô drift coefficient is therefore $\\bar{f}_I(x) = x + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 x$.\n\n**3. Reconciliation with an Alternative Approach**\n\nThe problem asks to reconcile this result with the one obtained by interpreting the original equation in the Itô sense. A naive interpretation would be to simply replace the $\\circ$ with a standard differential, leading to $\\mathrm{d}x_{t}^{\\varepsilon} = y_{t}^{\\varepsilon}\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma\\,x_{t}^{\\varepsilon} \\mathrm{d}W_{t}$. Averaging the drift $y_t^\\varepsilon$ would yield an averaged drift of $x$. This creates a discrepancy of $\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 x$.\n\nThe reconciliation lies in understanding that this naive interpretation is incorrect. The correct procedure is to first convert the original Stratonovich SDE system to its Itô equivalent *before* averaging.\n\nThe original system is:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\mathrm{d}x_{t}^{\\varepsilon} = y_{t}^{\\varepsilon}\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma\\,x_{t}^{\\varepsilon} \\circ \\mathrm{d}W_{t} \\\\\n\\mathrm{d}y_{t}^{\\varepsilon} = -\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\left(y_{t}^{\\varepsilon} - x_{t}^{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\mathrm{d}t + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}}\\,\\mathrm{d}B_{t}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nTo convert the first equation to Itô form, we must compute the Itô correction term, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{d}[\\sigma x^\\varepsilon, W]_t$. The quadratic covariation depends on the Itô differential of $x^\\varepsilon$ itself. The proper conversion rule for a system must be used. Let the state vector be $X_t = (x_t^\\varepsilon, y_t^\\varepsilon)^T$. The Stratonovich term is associated with the vector field $g_W(x,y) = (\\sigma x, 0)^T$. The Itô correction to the drift vector is $\\frac{1}{2} (D g_W) g_W$, where $D g_W$ is the Jacobian of $g_W$.\n$$\nD g_W = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\sigma x) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\sigma x) \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(0) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe correction vector is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} (D g_W) g_W = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma x \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 x \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis correction is added to the original drift vector $(y, -\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}(y-x))^T$. The resulting Itô system is:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\mathrm{d}x_{t}^{\\varepsilon} = \\left(y_{t}^{\\varepsilon} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 x_t^\\varepsilon \\right)\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma\\,x_{t}^{\\varepsilon} \\mathrm{d}W_{t} \\\\\n\\mathrm{d}y_{t}^{\\varepsilon} = -\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\left(y_{t}^{\\varepsilon} - x_{t}^{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\mathrm{d}t + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}}\\,\\mathrm{d}B_{t}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nNow, we apply the averaging principle to this Itô system. The drift of the slow variable is $f_I(x,y) = y + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 x$. The diffusion coefficient $\\sigma x$ does not depend on the fast variable $y$, so the averaged drift is simply the expectation of $f_I(x,y)$ with respect to the invariant measure $\\pi_x(y)$:\n$$\n\\bar{f}_I(x) = E_{\\pi_x}\\left[Y + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 x\\right] = E_{\\pi_x}[Y] + E_{\\pi_x}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 x\\right]\n$$\nAs established, $E_{\\pi_x}[Y] = x$. Since $\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 x$ is constant with respect to $y$, its expectation is itself. Therefore:\n$$\n\\bar{f}_I(x) = x + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 x\n$$\nBoth rigorous methods yield the same averaged Itô drift. The discrepancy arises from a fallacious comparison with a naive Itô interpretation. The reconciliation is the correct application of the Itô-Stratonovich conversion rules, which reveals a \"noise-induced drift\" term $\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 x$ that is present in the Itô formulation from the outset.\n\nThe reconciled averaged Itô drift coefficient is the final expression derived consistently from both paths.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{x + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 x}\n$$", "id": "3076830"}]}
