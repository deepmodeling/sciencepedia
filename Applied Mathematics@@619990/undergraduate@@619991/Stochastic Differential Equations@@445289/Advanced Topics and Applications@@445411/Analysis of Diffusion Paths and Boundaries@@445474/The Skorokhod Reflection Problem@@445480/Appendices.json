The input path $x(t)$ is a given continuous, piecewise linear function defined on the time interval $[0, 6.2]$. We are tasked with finding a pair of functions $(y(t), k(t))$ that satisfy the following four conditions for all $t \\in [0, 6.2]$:\n1.  $y(t) = x(t) + k(t)$\n2.  $y(t) \\geq 0$ (the reflected path must stay in the domain $D$)\n3.  $k(0) = 0$ and $k(t)$ is a nondecreasing function (the control process is cumulative and cannot decrease)\n4.  The control process $k(t)$ acts only when the path $y(t)$ is at the boundary of the domain, which is the point $0$. This is formally expressed by the condition that the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure $\\mathrm{d}k$ is supported on the set $\\{t : y(t) = 0\\}$, i.e., $\\int_{0}^{6.2} \\mathbf{1}_{\\{y(s)0\\}}\\,\\mathrm{d}k(s)=0$.\n\nFor a continuous input path $x(t)$, this problem is well-posed and has a unique solution. The solution is given by the following explicit formulas:\n$$ k(t) = \\max\\left(0, -\\inf_{s \\in [0, t]} x(s)\\right) $$\n$$ y(t) = x(t) + k(t) $$\nFirst, we verify that these formulas satisfy the required conditions. Let $m(t) = \\inf_{s \\in [0, t]} x(s)$.\nThe relation $y(t) = x(t) + k(t)$ holds by definition.\nThe input path is given by $x(t) = t$ for $0 \\leq t \\leq 1$, so $x(0) = 0$. Using the formula for $k(t)$ at $t=0$:\n$k(0) = \\max(0, -m(0)) = \\max(0, -x(0)) = \\max(0, 0) = 0$. The initial condition is satisfied.\n\nTo justify the nondecreasingness of $k(t)$, consider $0 \\leq t_1  t_2 \\leq 6.2$. The interval over which the infimum is taken expands, i.e., $[0, t_1] \\subset [0, t_2]$. Therefore, $m(t_2) = \\inf_{s \\in [0, t_2]} x(s) \\leq \\inf_{s \\in [0, t_1]} x(s) = m(t_1)$. This implies $-m(t_2) \\geq -m(t_1)$. Since the function $\\max(0, \\cdot)$ is nondecreasing, we have $k(t_2) = \\max(0, -m(t_2)) \\geq \\max(0, -m(t_1)) = k(t_1)$. Thus, $k(t)$ is nondecreasing.\n\nFor the nonnegativity of $y(t)$, we have $y(t) = x(t) + \\max(0, -m(t))$.\nIf $-m(t) \\leq 0$, then $k(t) = 0$ and $y(t) = x(t)$. In this case, $m(t) = \\inf_{s \\in [0, t]} x(s) \\geq 0$. Since $t \\in [0,t]$, we have $x(t) \\geq m(t) \\geq 0$. Hence $y(t) \\geq 0$.\nIf $-m(t)  0$, then $k(t) = -m(t)$ and $y(t) = x(t) - m(t) = x(t) - \\inf_{s \\in [0, t]} x(s)$. By the definition of the infimum, $x(t) \\geq \\inf_{s \\in [0, t]} x(s)$, so $y(t) \\geq 0$. In all cases, $y(t) \\geq 0$.\n\nLastly, we justify the support property of $\\mathrm{d}k$. The function $k(t)$ is continuous since $x(t)$ is continuous, which implies $m(t)$ is continuous. $k(t)$ is the composition of continuous functions. For a continuous nondecreasing function $k(t)$, the condition $\\int_{0}^{6.2} \\mathbf{1}_{\\{y(s)0\\}}\\,\\mathrm{d}k(s)=0$ means that if $y(t)  0$ on an open interval $(a,b)$, then $k(t)$ must be constant on $(a,b)$.\nLet's assume $y(t)0$ for $t \\in (a,b)$. Then $x(t) + k(t)  0$. From the analysis above, this implies $x(t) + \\max(0, -m(t))  0$.\nThe function $k(t)$ increases only if $-m(t)$ increases, which happens only if $m(t)$ decreases. A decrease in $m(t)$ at time $t$ can only occur if $x(t)$ attains a new minimum, i.e., $x(t) = m(t)$.\nAt such a time $t$, if $k(t)$ is to increase, we must have $m(t)  0$. In this case, $y(t) = x(t) + k(t) = m(t) + (-m(t)) = 0$.\nTherefore, $k(t)$ can only increase at times $t$ where $y(t)=0$. If $y(t)0$, $k(t)$ must be constant. This confirms the support condition.\n\nNow we proceed with the calculation for the specific $x(t)$ provided.\n$$\nx(t)=\n\\begin{cases}\nt,  0 \\leq t \\leq 1 \\\\\n2 - t,  1 \\leq t \\leq 3 \\\\\n-1 + 1.5(t-3),  3 \\leq t \\leq 4 \\\\\n0.5 - 0.8(t-4),  4 \\leq t \\leq 5 \\\\\n-0.3 + 0.25(t-5),  5 \\leq t \\leq 6.2\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nWe first compute the running infimum $m(t) = \\inf_{s \\in [0, t]} x(s)$:\n- For $t \\in [0, 1]$, $x(s)=s$ is increasing from $0$ to $1$. So, $m(t) = \\inf_{s \\in [0,t]} s = 0$.\n- For $t \\in [1, 3]$, $x(s)=2-s$ is decreasing from $1$ to $-1$. The infimum up to time $t$ is $m(t) = \\inf(m(1), \\inf_{s \\in [1,t]} x(s)) = \\inf(0, x(t)) = \\inf(0, 2-t)$. Since $2-t \\geq 0$ for $t \\leq 2$ and $2-t  0$ for $t  2$, we have $m(t) = 0$ for $t \\in [1,2]$ and $m(t) = 2-t$ for $t \\in [2,3]$.\n- For $t \\in [3, 4]$, $x(s)=-1 + 1.5(s-3)$ is increasing from $-1$ to $0.5$. The infimum $m(t) = \\inf(m(3), \\inf_{s \\in [3,t]} x(s)) = \\inf(-1, x(3)) = \\inf(-1, -1) = -1$.\n- For $t \\in [4, 5]$, $x(s)=0.5 - 0.8(s-4)$ is decreasing from $0.5$ to $-0.3$. The infimum $m(t) = \\inf(m(4), \\inf_{s \\in [4,t]} x(s)) = \\inf(-1, x(t)) = \\inf(-1, 0.5 - 0.8(t-4))$. The expression $0.5 - 0.8(t-4)$ is always greater than $-1$ for $t \\in [4,5]$. So, $m(t) = -1$.\n- For $t \\in [5, 6.2]$, $x(s)=-0.3 + 0.25(s-5)$ is increasing from $-0.3$ to $0$. The infimum $m(t) = \\inf(m(5), \\inf_{s \\in [5,t]} x(s)) = \\inf(-1, x(5)) = \\inf(-1, -0.3) = -1$.\n\nIn summary, the running infimum is:\n$$\nm(t) =\n\\begin{cases}\n0,  0 \\leq t \\leq 2 \\\\\n2-t,  2 \\leq t \\leq 3 \\\\\n-1,  3 \\leq t \\leq 6.2\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nNext, we compute $k(t) = \\max(0, -m(t))$:\n- For $t \\in [0, 2]$, $m(t) = 0$, so $k(t) = \\max(0, 0) = 0$.\n- For $t \\in [2, 3]$, $m(t) = 2-t \\leq 0$, so $k(t) = \\max(0, -(2-t)) = \\max(0, t-2)$. Since $t \\geq 2$, $t-2 \\geq 0$, hence $k(t) = t-2$.\n- For $t \\in [3, 6.2]$, $m(t) = -1$, so $k(t) = \\max(0, -(-1)) = \\max(0, 1) = 1$.\n\nSo, the control process $k(t)$ is:\n$$\nk(t) =\n\\begin{cases}\n0,  0 \\leq t \\leq 2 \\\\\nt-2,  2 \\leq t \\leq 3 \\\\\n1,  3 \\leq t \\leq 6.2\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the reflected path $y(t) = x(t) + k(t)$ by combining the piecewise definitions:\n- For $t \\in [0, 1]: y(t) = x(t)+k(t) = t + 0 = t$.\n- For $t \\in [1, 2]: y(t) = x(t)+k(t) = (2-t) + 0 = 2-t$.\n- For $t \\in [2, 3]: y(t) = x(t)+k(t) = (2-t) + (t-2) = 0$.\n- For $t \\in [3, 4]: y(t) = x(t)+k(t) = (-1 + 1.5(t-3)) + 1 = 1.5(t-3)$.\n- For $t \\in [4, 5]: y(t) = x(t)+k(t) = (0.5 - 0.8(t-4)) + 1 = 1.5 - 0.8(t-4)$.\n- For $t \\in [5, 6.2]: y(t) = x(t)+k(t) = (-0.3 + 0.25(t-5)) + 1 = 0.7 + 0.25(t-5)$.\n\nThis gives the full piecewise definition of the reflected path $y(t)$.\n$$\ny(t) =\n\\begin{cases}\nt,  0 \\leq t \\leq 1 \\\\\n2 - t,  1 \\leq t \\leq 2 \\\\\n0,  2 \\leq t \\leq 3 \\\\\n1.5(t-3),  3 \\leq t \\leq 4 \\\\\n1.5 - 0.8(t-4),  4 \\leq t \\leq 5 \\\\\n0.7 + 0.25(t-5),  5 \\leq t \\leq 6.2\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThese expressions for $k(t)$ and $y(t)$ constitute the solution to the Skorokhod problem.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nk(t) = \n\\begin{cases}\n0,  0 \\leq t \\leq 2 \\\\\nt-2,  2 \\leq t \\leq 3 \\\\\n1,  3 \\leq t \\leq 6.2\n\\end{cases}\n\ny(t) = \n\\begin{cases}\nt,  0 \\leq t \\leq 1 \\\\\n2 - t,  1 \\leq t \\leq 2 \\\\\n0,  2 \\leq t \\leq 3 \\\\\n1.5(t-3),  3 \\leq t \\leq 4 \\\\\n1.5 - 0.8(t-4),  4 \\leq t \\leq 5 \\\\\n0.7 + 0.25(t-5),  5 \\leq t \\leq 6.2\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3081591"}, {"introduction": "Building on the previous example, this practice challenges you to apply the reflection principle to a smooth, oscillating path.

For $t0.5$, $X_t  0.15$.\nThus, $-X_t$ is negative and decreasing.\nThe supremum $M_t = \\sup_{s \\in [0,t]} (-X_s)$ does not change from its value at $t=0.5$, so $M_t = -0.15$.\n$K_t = \\max(0, -0.15) = 0$.\n$Y_t = X_t + K_t = X_t = -0.2 + 0.7t$.\nJust before the second jump at $t=1.6$:\n$X_{1.6^-} = -0.2 + 0.7(1.6) = -0.2 + 1.12 = 0.92$.\n$K_{1.6^-} = 0$.\n$Y_{1.6^-} = 0.92$.\n\n**Jump 2: At $t = T_2 = 1.6$**\nA jump of size $J_2 = -2.3$ occurs.\n$X_{1.6} = X_{1.6^-} + J_2 = 0.92 - 2.3 = -1.38$.\nThe process $X_t$ becomes negative. We must update the supremum.\n$M_{1.6} = \\sup_{s \\in [0, 1.6]} (-X_s) = \\max(M_{1.6^-}, -X_{1.6}) = \\max(-0.15, -(-1.38)) = \\max(-0.15, 1.38) = 1.38$.\n$K_{1.6} = \\max(0, 1.38) = 1.38$.\nThe jump in $K$ is $\\Delta K_{1.6} = K_{1.6} - K_{1.6^-} = 1.38 - 0 = 1.38$.\n$Y_{1.6} = X_{1.6} + K_{1.6} = -1.38 + 1.38 = 0$. The reflection pushes the process back to the barrier.\n\n**Interval 3: $t \\in (1.6, 3.2)$**\nFor $t$ in this interval, $X_t = x_0 + \\beta t + J_1 + J_2 = 1 + 0.7t - 1.2 - 2.3 = -2.5 + 0.7t$.\nThis function is increasing. At $t=1.6$, $X_{1.6} = -1.38$. For $t1.6$, $X_t  -1.38$.\nThis means $-X_t  1.38$.\nThe supremum $M_t = \\sup_{s \\in [0,t]} (-X_s)$ remains at the value set at $t=1.6$, so $M_t = 1.38$.\n$K_t = \\max(0, 1.38) = 1.38$. The regulator is constant in this interval.\n$Y_t = X_t + K_t = (-2.5 + 0.7t) + 1.38 = -1.12 + 0.7t$.\nNote that $Y_{1.6} = -1.12 + 0.7(1.6) = 0$, and for $t1.6$, $Y_t  0$. This is consistent with $K_t$ being constant.\nJust before the third jump at $t=3.2$:\n$X_{3.2^-} = -2.5 + 0.7(3.2) = -2.5 + 2.24 = -0.26$.\n$K_{3.2^-} = 1.38$.\n$Y_{3.2^-} = X_{3.2^-} + K_{3.2^-} = -0.26 + 1.38 = 1.12$.\n\n**Jump 3: At $t = T_3 = 3.2$**\nA jump of size $J_3 = -0.9$ occurs.\n$X_{3.2} = X_{3.2^-} + J_3 = -0.26 - 0.9 = -1.16$.\nWe check if this creates a new supremum for $-X_s$.\n$M_{3.2} = \\sup_{s \\in [0, 3.2]} (-X_s) = \\max(M_{3.2^-}, -X_{3.2}) = \\max(1.38, -(-1.16)) = \\max(1.38, 1.16) = 1.38$.\nThe supremum does not change.\n$K_{3.2} = \\max(0, 1.38) = 1.38$.\nThe jump in $K$ is $\\Delta K_{3.2} = K_{3.2} - K_{3.2^-} = 1.38 - 1.38 = 0$.\n$Y_{3.2} = X_{3.2} + K_{3.2} = -1.16 + 1.38 = 0.22$. Since $Y_{3.2}  0$, no reflection is needed.\n\n**Interval 4: $t \\in (3.2, 4]$**\nFor $t$ in this interval, $X_t = x_0 + \\beta t + J_1 + J_2 + J_3 = 1 + 0.7t - 1.2 - 2.3 - 0.9 = -3.4 + 0.7t$.\nThis function is increasing. At $t=3.2$, $X_{3.2} = -1.16$. For $t3.2$, $X_t  -1.16$.\nSo $-X_t  1.16$.\nThe supremum $M_t = \\sup_{s \\in [0,t]} (-X_s)$ remains $M_t = 1.38$.\n$K_t = \\max(0, 1.38) = 1.38$. The regulator is constant.\nAt the final time $T=4$:\n$X_T = X_4 = -3.4 + 0.7(4) = -3.4 + 2.8 = -0.6$.\n$K_T = K_4 = 1.38$.\n$Y_T = Y_4 = X_4 + K_4 = -0.6 + 1.38 = 0.78$.\n\nThe required values are:\n- $Y_T = Y_4 = 0.78$\n- $K_T = K_4 = 1.38$\n- $\\Delta K_{T_1} = \\Delta K_{0.5} = 0$\n- $\\Delta K_{T_2} = \\Delta K_{1.6} = 1.38$\n- $\\Delta K_{T_3} = \\Delta K_{3.2} = 0$\n\nWe assemble these results into the requested row vector $(Y_T, K_T, \\Delta K_{T_1}, \\Delta K_{T_2}, \\Delta K_{T_3})$.\nThe final vector is $(0.78, 1.38, 0, 1.38, 0)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.78  1.38  0  1.38  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3081635"}]}
