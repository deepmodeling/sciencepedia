We derive, from first principles, the probability that a scaled Brownian motion bridge between two points hits a constant boundary, and then apply this result to our problem.\n\nStep 1: Change of Measure\nLet $P$ be the physical measure under which $W_t$ is a standard Brownian motion.

We want to compute $P(A|C)$. By definition, $P(A|C) = P(A \\cap C) / P(C)$. In terms of expectations under measure $P$, this is $E_P[\\mathbb{I}_A \\mathbb{I}_C] / E_P[\\mathbb{I}_C]$.\nUsing the change of measure, we can write expectations under $P$ as expectations under $Q$:\n$$P(A|C) = \\frac{E_Q\\left[\\frac{dP}{dQ}\\bigg|_{\\mathcal{F}_{\\Delta t}} \\mathbb{I}_A \\mathbb{I}_C\\right]}{E_Q\\left[\\frac{dP}{dQ}\\bigg|_{\\mathcal{F}_{\\Delta t}} \\mathbb{I}_C\\right]}$$\nThe Radon-Nikodym derivative $dP/dQ$ is the inverse of $dQ/dP$:\n$$\\frac{dP}{dQ}\\bigg|_{\\mathcal{F}_{\\Delta t}} = \\exp\\left(\\int_0^{\\Delta t} \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma} dW_s + \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^{\\Delta t} \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2 ds\\right)$$\nExpressing $dW_s$ in terms of $d X_s$ under measure $P$, $dW_s = (dX_s - \\mu ds)/\\sigma$, we can write the integral in the exponent as $\\int_0^{\\Delta t} \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma^2}(dX_s - \\mu ds) = \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma^2}(X_{\\Delta t}-X_0) - \\frac{\\mu^2}{\\sigma^2}\\Delta t$.\nThus, the Radon-Nikodym derivative at time $\\Delta t$ is:\n$$L_{\\Delta t} = \\frac{dP}{dQ}\\bigg|_{\\mathcal{F}_{\\Delta t}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma^2}(X_{\\Delta t}-x) - \\frac{\\mu^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\Delta t\\right)$$\nOn the conditioning set $C = \\{X_{\\Delta t}=y\\}$, this derivative is a constant value:\n$$L_{\\Delta t}|_C = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma^2}(y-x) - \\frac{\\mu^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\Delta t\\right)$$\nSince this value is constant on the set $C$, it can be factored out of the expectations:\n$$P(A|C) = \\frac{E_Q\\left[L_{\\Delta t}|_C \\cdot \\mathbb{I}_A \\mathbb{I}_C\\right]}{E_Q\\left[L_{\\Delta t}|_C \\cdot \\mathbb{I}_C\\right]} = \\frac{L_{\\Delta t}|_C \\cdot E_Q[\\mathbb{I}_A \\mathbb{I}_C]}{L_{\\Delta t}|_C \\cdot E_Q[\\mathbb{I}_C]} = \\frac{E_Q[\\mathbb{I}_{A \\cap C}]}{E_Q[\\mathbb{I}_C]} = Q(A|C)$$\nThis shows that the desired conditional probability is the same under measure $Q$. The problem is now reduced to finding $Q(\\min_{s \\in [0, \\Delta t]} X_s \\le 0 \\mid X_0=x, X_{\\Delta t}=y)$, where under $Q$, $X_s$ is a scaled Brownian motion with $dX_s = \\sigma d\\tilde{W}_s$.\n\nStep 3: Hitting Probability of a Scaled Brownian Bridge\nWe need to find the probability that a scaled Brownian motion, starting at $a$ and conditioned to end at $b$ at time $T$, has crossed a level $c$ in between.

According to the reflection principle for Brownian motion, the \"number\" of paths from $a$ to $b$ in time $T$ that touch or cross the level $c$ is equal to the \"number\" of paths from the reflected starting point $a' = 2c-a$ to $b$.\nThe transition probability density for the process $Z_t$ from a point $u$ to a point $v$ in time $T$ is given by the Gaussian kernel:\n$$p(u, v; T) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma^2 T}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(v-u)^2}{2\\sigma^2 T}\\right)$$\nThe conditional probability is the ratio of the density of paths that hit the boundary to the density of all paths:\n$$P(\\min_{s \\in [0,T]} Z_s \\le c \\mid Z_0=a, Z_T=b) = \\frac{p(2c-a, b; T)}{p(a, b; T)}$$\n$$= \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma^2 T}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(b-(2c-a))^2}{2\\sigma^2 T}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma^2 T}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(b-a)^2}{2\\sigma^2 T}\\right)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(b+a-2c)^2 - (b-a)^2}{2\\sigma^2 T}\\right)$$\nThe term in the exponent simplifies:\n$$(b+a-2c)^2 - (b-a)^2 = ((b-c)+(a-c))^2 - ((b-c)-(a-c))^2 = 4(a-c)(b-c)$$\nSo, the probability is:\n$$P(\\min_{s \\in [0,T]} Z_s \\le c \\mid Z_0=a, Z_T=b) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4(a-c)(b-c)}{2\\sigma^2 T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2(a-c)(b-c)}{\\sigma^2 T}\\right)$$\nWe now apply this general formula to our specific problem. Under measure $Q$, the process is $X_s$ with dynamics $dX_s = \\sigma d\\tilde{W}_s$. We match the parameters:\n- Process: $Z_s \\rightarrow X_s$\n- Start point: $a \\rightarrow X_0 = x$\n- End point: $b \\rightarrow X_{\\Delta t} = y$\n- Boundary level: $c \\rightarrow 0$\n- Time interval: $T \\rightarrow \\Delta t$\nThe conditions $x0$ and $y0$ correspond to $ac$ and $bc$.
