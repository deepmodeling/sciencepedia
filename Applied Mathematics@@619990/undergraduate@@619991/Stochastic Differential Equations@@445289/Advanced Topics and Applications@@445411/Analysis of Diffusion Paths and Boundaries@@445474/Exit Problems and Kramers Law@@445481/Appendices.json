It is scientifically grounded in the theory of stochastic differential equations, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and stated in objective, unambiguous terms.\n\nWe are asked to find the mean first exit time, $\\mathbb{E}_x[\\tau]$, for a particle undergoing Brownian motion from the open interval $(0,1)$. The motion is described by the one-dimensional stochastic differential equation (SDE):\n$$dX_t = \\sqrt{2}\\,dW_t$$\nwith an initial position $X_0 = x \\in (0,1)$. The exit time $\\tau$ is defined as $\\tau = \\inf\\{t \\ge 0: X_t \\notin (0,1)\\}$. Let $u(x) = \\mathbb{E}_x[\\tau]$ denote the mean exit time as a function of the starting position $x$.\n\nThe problem suggests using the concept of an infinitesimal generator. The generator $\\mathcal{L}$ of a general time-homogeneous Itô process $dX_t = b(X_t)dt + \\sigma(X_t)dW_t$ acting on a sufficiently smooth function $f(x)$ is given by:\n$$\\mathcal{L}f(x) = b(x)\\frac{df}{dx} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma(x)^2\\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}$$\nFor the given SDE, the drift coefficient is $b(x) = 0$ and the diffusion coefficient is $\\sigma(x) = \\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the infinitesimal generator is:\n$$\\mathcal{L}f(x) = (0)\\frac{df}{dx} + \\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{2})^2\\frac{d^2f}{dx^2} = \\frac{1}{2}(2)\\frac{d^2f}{dx^2} = \\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}$$\nSo, for our specific process, the generator $\\mathcal{L}$ is simply the second derivative operator, $\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}$.\n\nTo find $u(x)$, we use a fundamental result that connects the mean exit time to the generator, which can be derived from Dynkin's formula. Dynkin's formula states that for a suitable function $f$ and a stopping time $\\tau$ with finite expectation,\n$$\\mathbb{E}_x[f(X_\\tau)] - f(x) = \\mathbb{E}_x\\left[\\int_0^\\tau (\\mathcal{L}f)(X_s) ds\\right]$$\nThe key step is to recognize that the mean exit time $u(x)$ itself satisfies the Poisson equation $\\mathcal{L}u(x) = -1$ inside the domain, with boundary conditions reflecting that the exit time is zero if starting on the boundary. We can prove this relationship using Dynkin's formula. Let us assume that our mean exit time function $u(x)$ is twice continuously differentiable and solves the boundary value problem:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}u(x) = -1, \\quad x \\in (0,1) $$\n$$ u(x) = 0, \\quad x \\in \\{0, 1\\} $$\nNow, let's substitute $f(x) = u(x)$ into Dynkin's formula:\n$$\\mathbb{E}_x[u(X_\\tau)] - u(x) = \\mathbb{E}_x\\left[\\int_0^\\tau (\\mathcal{L}u)(X_s) ds\\right]$$\nBy definition of the exit time $\\tau$, the process stops when $X_\\tau$ reaches the boundary $\\{0,1\\}$. According to our proposed boundary conditions, $u(0)=0$ and $u(1)=0$. Thus, $u(X_\\tau) = 0$. The left side of the equation becomes:\n$$\\mathbb{E}_x[0] - u(x) = -u(x)$$\nFor the right side, we use our assumption that $\\mathcal{L}u(x) = -1$ for all $x$ in the domain. So, $(\\mathcal{L}u)(X_s) = -1$ for all $s < \\tau$. The integral becomes:\n$$\\mathbb{E}_x\\left[\\int_0^\\tau (-1) ds\\right] = \\mathbb{E}_x\\left[-s\\right]_0^\\tau = \\mathbb{E}_x[-\\tau] = -\\mathbb{E}_x[\\tau]$$\nEquating the transformed left and right sides of Dynkin's formula gives:\n$$-u(x) = -\\mathbb{E}_x[\\tau]$$\nThis confirms that if we find the function $u(x)$ that solves the specified boundary value problem, it will be the mean exit time, i.e., $u(x) = \\mathbb{E}_x[\\tau]$.\n\nWe now solve the boundary value problem. Substituting the specific generator $\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}$, the problem becomes:\n$$u''(x) = -1 \\quad \\text{for } x \\in (0,1)$$\nwith boundary conditions:\n$$u(0) = 0$$\n$$u(1) = 0$$\nWe solve this second-order ordinary differential equation by integrating twice with respect to $x$. The first integration yields:\n$$u'(x) = \\int -1 \\, dx = -x + C_1$$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration. Integrating a second time gives:\n$$u(x) = \\int (-x + C_1) \\, dx = -\\frac{x^2}{2} + C_1 x + C_2$$\nwhere $C_2$ is a second constant of integration. We determine the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ using the boundary conditions.\nApplying the condition $u(0)=0$:\n$$u(0) = -\\frac{0^2}{2} + C_1(0) + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = 0$$\nThe solution simplifies to $u(x) = -\\frac{x^2}{2} + C_1 x$. Now, applying the second condition $u(1)=0$:\n$$u(1) = -\\frac{1^2}{2} + C_1(1) = 0 \\implies -\\frac{1}{2} + C_1 = 0 \\implies C_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nSubstituting the values of $C_1$ and $C_2$ back into the general solution, we obtain the exact expression for the mean exit time:\n$$u(x) = -\\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}x$$\nThis can be written in a factored form:\n$$u(x) = \\frac{x(1-x)}{2}$$\nThe problem asks to confirm that $\\mathbb{E}_x[\\tau]$ depends quadratically on $x$. Our derived expression for $u(x) = \\mathbb{E}_x[\\tau]$ is $u(x) = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}x$, which is a polynomial of degree $2$ in $x$.

I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Solution\n\n#### Step 2.1: The Governing Equation for the MFPT\n\nThe given SDE is of the form $dX_t = a(X_t)dt + b(X_t)dW_t$, with a drift coefficient $a(x) = -V'(x)$ and a diffusion coefficient $b(x) = \\sqrt{2\\varepsilon}$. The infinitesimal generator $\\mathcal{L}$ of this diffusion process is given by:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} = a(x) \\frac{d}{dx} + \\frac{1}{2} b(x)^2 \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\n$$\nSubstituting the given coefficients, we obtain:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} = -V'(x) \\frac{d}{dx} + \\frac{1}{2} (\\sqrt{2\\varepsilon})^2 \\frac{d^2}{dx^2} = -V'(x) \\frac{d}{dx} + \\varepsilon \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\n$$\nThe Mean First Passage Time $T_{\\varepsilon}(x)$ for a particle starting at $x$ to exit a domain satisfies the Dynkin equation, which is a backward Fokker-Planck equation for the time variable:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} T_{\\varepsilon}(x) = -1\n$$\nThis yields the following second-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $T_{\\varepsilon}(x)$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon \\frac{d^2 T_{\\varepsilon}}{dx^2} - V'(x) \\frac{d T_{\\varepsilon}}{dx} = -1\n$$\nThis equation is valid for $x$ within the domain of motion, i.e., $x \\in (x_a, x_s)$.\n\n#### Step 2.2: Boundary Conditions\n\nThe boundary conditions for $T_{\\varepsilon}(x)$ are determined by the nature of the boundaries at $x_a$ and $x_s$.\n-   At $x=x_s$, there is an absorbing boundary. This means that once the particle reaches $x_s$, the process terminates. The time taken to reach $x_s$ starting from $x_s$ is zero. Thus, we have the condition:\n    $$\n    T_{\\varepsilon}(x_s) = 0\n    $$\n-   At $x=x_a$, there is a reflecting boundary. This condition implies that there is no probability flux across this boundary. For the MFPT equation, this translates to a zero-derivative condition:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d T_{\\varepsilon}}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=x_a} = 0\n    $$\n\nSo, we must solve the boundary value problem (BVP):\n$$\n\\varepsilon T_{\\varepsilon}''(x) - V'(x) T_{\\varepsilon}'(x) = -1, \\quad T_{\\varepsilon}'(x_a) = 0, \\quad T_{\\varepsilon}(x_s) = 0\n$$\n\n#### Step 2.3: Exact Integral Solution\n\nLet $u(x) = T_{\\varepsilon}'(x)$. The ODE becomes a first-order linear ODE for $u(x)$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon u'(x) - V'(x) u(x) = -1\n$$\nThe integrating factor for this equation is $I(x) = \\exp\\left(\\int \\frac{-V'(x)}{\\varepsilon} dx\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{V(x)}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$.

We set $x=x_m$:\n$$\nT_{\\varepsilon}(x_m) = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} \\int_{x_m}^{x_s} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V(y)}{\\varepsilon}\\right) \\left( \\int_{x_a}^y \\exp\\left(-\\frac{V(z)}{\\varepsilon}\\right) dz \\right) dy\n$$\nThis is a double integral of an exponential function. In the limit $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, such integrals can be evaluated asymptotically using Laplace's method. The value of the integral is dominated by the point in the domain of integration where the exponent is maximal.\n\nThe term in the exponent of the combined integrand is $(V(y) - V(z))/\\varepsilon$. We need to find the maximum of the function $f(y,z) = V(y) - V(z)$ over the domain of integration $D = \\{(y, z) | x_m \\leq y \\leq x_s, x_a \\leq z \\leq y\\}$.\n\nTo maximize $f(y,z)$, we need to maximize $V(y)$ and minimize $V(z)$ within the allowed domain.\n1.  **Maximizing $V(y)$**: The variable $y$ is in the interval $[x_m, x_s]$. By definition, $x_m$ is a local minimum and $x_s$ is the adjacent local maximum of the potential $V$. Therefore, on the interval $[x_m, x_s]$, the potential $V(y)$ attains its maximum at $y=x_s$.\n2.  **Minimizing $V(z)$**: The variable $z$ is in the interval $[x_a, y]$. Since $y \\geq x_m$ and $x_a < x_m$, the interval $[x_a, y]$ always contains the local minimum $x_m$. Therefore, the potential $V(z)$ attains its minimum on this interval at $z=x_m$.\n\nThe maximum value of the exponent is thus achieved at the point $(y, z) = (x_s, x_m)$. The maximum value of $f(y,z)$ is:\n$$\n\\max_{(y,z) \\in D} [V(y) - V(z)] = V(x_s) - V(x_m)\n$$\nThis quantity is the height of the potential barrier, $\\Delta V = V(x_s)-V(x_m)$, which is positive since $x_s$ is a local maximum and $x_m$ is a local minimum.\n\nAccording to the principle of Laplace's method, the leading asymptotic behavior of the integral is determined by the exponential of its maximum value divided by $\\varepsilon$. The overall expression for $T_{\\varepsilon}(x_m)$ contains prefactors involving $\\varepsilon$ and terms from the Gaussian integrals around the maximum, but the dominant exponential dependence is given by the maximum of the exponent.\n$$\nT_{\\varepsilon}(x_m) \\sim \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\max [V(y) - V(z)]}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\n$$\nTherefore, the leading exponential factor of $T_{\\varepsilon}(x_m)$ as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$ is:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(\\frac{V(x_s) - V(x_m)}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\n$$\nThis result is the core of Kramers' escape rate theory, where the mean escape time is exponentially long for small noise, with the rate determined by the height of the potential barrier.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\exp\\left(\\frac{V(x_s) - V(x_m)}{\\varepsilon}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "3052381"}, {"introduction": "Physical systems are often multidimensional, and the escape path is not just about energy, but also about geometry.

Thus, the unstable direction is along the vector $(1,0)$, which is the $x$-axis.\n\nFinally, we substitute the calculated quantities into the formula for the prefactor $K$:\n$$\nK = \\frac{|\\lambda_{u,S}|}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\det(H_A)}{|\\det(H_S)|}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\alpha}{\\alpha}}\n$$\nSince $\\alpha > 0$, we can simplify the expression:\n$$\nK = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2\\pi}\n$$\nThis is the multidimensional prefactor for the exit rate.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2\\pi}}\n$$", "id": "3052364"}]}
