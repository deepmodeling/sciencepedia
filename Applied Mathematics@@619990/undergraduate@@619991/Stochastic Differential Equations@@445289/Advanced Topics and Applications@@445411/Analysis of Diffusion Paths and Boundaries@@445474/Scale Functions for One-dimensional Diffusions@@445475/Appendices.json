A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet the one-dimensional diffusion process $X_{t}$ be governed by the stochastic differential equation:\n$$dX_{t} = \\mu\\,dt + \\sigma\\,dW_{t}$$\nwhere $X_{0} = x \\in (a,b)$, $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\sigma  0$ are constants.\n\nThe infinitesimal generator $\\mathcal{L}$ of this diffusion process, applied to a twice continuously differentiable function $f(y)$, is given by:\n$$\\mathcal{L}f(y) = \\mu \\frac{df}{dy} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2} \\frac{d^{2}f}{dy^{2}}$$\n\nA scale function $s(y)$ for the process $X_{t}$ is defined as a non-constant, twice continuously differentiable function that satisfies the ordinary differential equation (ODE) $\\mathcal{L}s(y) = 0$. Therefore, the scale function for our process must satisfy:\n$$\\mu s'(y) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2} s''(y) = 0$$\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients. We analyze two cases based on the value of $\\mu$.\n\n**Case 1: $\\mu \\neq 0$**\nThe characteristic equation for the ODE is $\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}r^{2} + \\mu r = 0$, which can be written as $r(\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}r + \\mu) = 0$. The roots are $r_{1}=0$ and $r_{2}=-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^{2}}$. Since $\\mu \\neq 0$, the roots are distinct. The general solution for $s(y)$ is a linear combination of the basis functions $\\exp(r_{1}y)$ and $\\exp(r_{2}y)$:\n$$s(y) = c_{1}\\exp(0 \\cdot y) + c_{2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^{2}}y\\right) = c_{1} + c_{2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^{2}}y\\right)$$\nwhere $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ are arbitrary constants. To serve as a scale function, $s(y)$ must be non-constant, so we require $c_{2} \\neq 0$. We can choose a particular solution for simplicity, for instance by setting $c_{1}=0$ and $c_{2}=1$. Let us use the specific scale function:\n$$s(y) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^{2}}y\\right)$$\n\n**Case 2: $\\mu = 0$**\nThe ODE simplifies to $\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}s''(y)=0$, which implies $s''(y)=0$ since $\\sigma0$. The characteristic equation has a repeated root $r_{1}=r_{2}=0$. The general solution is:\n$$s(y) = c_{1} + c_{2}y$$\nAgain, for a non-constant function, we need $c_{2} \\neq 0$. A simple choice is $s(y) = y$.\n\nNow, let $M_{t} = s(X_{t})$. By applying Itô's formula to $s(X_{t})$:\n$$dM_{t} = d(s(X_{t})) = s'(X_{t})dX_{t} + \\frac{1}{2}s''(X_{t})d\\langle X,X \\rangle_{t}$$\nWith $dX_{t} = \\mu dt + \\sigma dW_{t}$, the quadratic variation is $d\\langle X,X \\rangle_{t} = \\sigma^{2}dt$. Substituting these gives:\n$$dM_{t} = s'(X_{t})(\\mu dt + \\sigma dW_{t}) + \\frac{1}{2}s''(X_{t})\\sigma^{2}dt = \\left(\\mu s'(X_{t}) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}s''(X_{t})\\right)dt + \\sigma s'(X_{t})dW_{t}$$\nThe term in the parenthesis is precisely $(\\mathcal{L}s)(X_{t})$. By definition of the scale function $s$, we have $\\mathcal{L}s = 0$. Thus, the drift term vanishes:\n$$dM_{t} = \\sigma s'(X_{t})dW_{t}$$\nThis shows that the process $M_{t} = s(X_{t})$ is a local martingale.\n\nLet $T = \\min(T_{a}, T_{b})$ be the first exit time of $X_{t}$ from the interval $(a,b)$. Since $x \\in (a,b)$ and the interval is finite, $T$ is a stopping time that is finite almost surely. The process $X_{t}$ is bounded on the time interval $[0, T]$ (it is confined to $[a,b]$). Consequently, $s(X_{t})$ is a bounded function of $t$ for $t \\in [0, T]$, which means the stopped process $M_{t \\land T} = s(X_{t \\land T})$ is a true martingale, and it is bounded.\n\nBy the Optional Stopping Theorem for bounded martingales, we have:\n$$\\mathbb{E}_{x}[M_{T}] = M_{0}$$\nSubstituting the definitions of $M_t$ and $X_0$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}_{x}[s(X_{T})] = s(X_{0}) = s(x)$$\nAt the stopping time $T$, the process is at one of the boundaries, i.e., $X_{T} \\in \\{a, b\\}$. Let $p_{x} = P_{x}(T_{b}  T_{a})$ be the probability we seek. Then $P_{x}(T_{a} \\leq T_{b}) = 1 - p_{x}$, as the event $T_a=T_b$ has zero probability for a diffusion. We can expand the expectation:\n$$\\mathbb{E}_{x}[s(X_{T})] = s(b) \\cdot P_{x}(T_{b}  T_{a}) + s(a) \\cdot P_{x}(T_{a} \\leq T_{b}) = s(b)p_{x} + s(a)(1-p_{x})$$\nEquating this with $s(x)$:\n$$s(x) = s(b)p_{x} + s(a) - s(a)p_{x}$$\n$$s(x) - s(a) = p_{x}(s(b) - s(a))$$\nSince $s(y)$ is a non-constant function and $a \\neq b$, we have $s(b) - s(a) \\neq 0$. We can therefore solve for $p_{x}$:\n$$p_{x} = P_{x}(T_{b}  T_{a}) = \\frac{s(x) - s(a)}{s(b) - s(a)}$$\n\nThis general formula is valid for any choice of scale function. We now substitute the specific form of $s(y)$ derived earlier.\n\nFor $\\mu \\neq 0$, using $s(y) = \\exp(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^{2}}y)$:\n$$P_{x}(T_{b}  T_{a}) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^{2}}x) - \\exp(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^{2}}a)}{\\exp(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^{2}}b) - \\exp(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^{2}}a)}$$\nFor $\\mu = 0$, using $s(y) = y$:\n$$P_{x}(T_{b}  T_{a}) = \\frac{x-a}{b-a}$$\nIt is a standard result that the expression for $\\mu \\neq 0$ converges to the expression for $\\mu = 0$ in the limit as $\\mu \\to 0$, which can be verified using L'Hôpital's rule on the variable $\\gamma = -2\\mu/\\sigma^2$ as $\\gamma \\to 0$.

The derivative of our scale function is $s'(x) = p(x) = \\frac{1}{(1+x)^2}$.\n\n### Step 2: Compute the Speed Measure\nThe speed measure density $m(x)$ is given by the formula (consistent with the main text):\n$$\nm(x) = \\frac{2}{\\sigma(x)^2 p(x)}\n$$\nUsing our previously computed values for $\\sigma(x)$ and $p(x)$:\n$$\nm(x) = \\frac{2}{1^2 \\cdot (1+x)^{-2}} = 2(1+x)^2\n$$\nThe speed measure is $m(dx) = m(x) dx = 2(1+x)^2 dx$.\n\n### Step 3: Classify the Boundaries\nWe need to classify the left boundary $l=0$ and the right boundary $r=1$. We choose an arbitrary point $c$ in the interior of the interval, for example, $c = 1/2$. The classification depends on the finiteness of the following integrals.\n\n**For the left boundary $l=0$:**\nWe evaluate the integrals of the scale density and speed density from the boundary $l=0$ to the interior point $c$.\n1.  Integral of the scale density:\n    $$\n    N(l) = \\int_l^c p(x) dx = \\int_0^{1/2} \\frac{1}{(1+x)^2} dx = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{1+x} \\right]_0^{1/2} = \\left(-\\frac{1}{1+1/2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{1+0}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{3/2} + 1 = -\\frac{2}{3} + 1 = \\frac{1}{3}\n    $$\n    This integral is **finite**.\n2.  Integral of the speed density:\n    $$\n    S(l) = \\int_l^c m(x) dx = \\int_0^{1/2} 2(1+x)^2 dx = 2\\left[ \\frac{(1+x)^3}{3} \\right]_0^{1/2} = 2\\left(\\frac{(1+1/2)^3}{3} - \\frac{(1+0)^3}{3}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{9}{8} - \\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{19}{24}\\right) = \\frac{19}{12}\n    $$\n    This integral is **finite**.\n\nAccording to the Feller boundary classification for the left boundary $l$:\n- $N(l)  \\infty$ and $S(l)  \\infty \\implies l$ is **regular**.\n- $N(l)  \\infty$ and $S(l) = \\infty \\implies l$ is **exit**.\n- $N(l) = \\infty$ and $S(l)  \\infty \\implies l$ is **entrance**.\n- $N(l) = \\infty$ and $S(l) = \\infty \\implies l$ is **natural**.\n\nSince both $N(0)$ and $S(0)$ are finite, the left boundary $0$ is **regular**.\n\n**For the right boundary $r=1$:**\nWe evaluate the integrals from the interior point $c$ to the boundary $r=1$.\n1.  Integral of the scale density:\n    $$\n    N(r) = \\int_c^r p(x) dx = \\int_{1/2}^1 \\frac{1}{(1+x)^2} dx = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{1+x} \\right]_{1/2}^1 = \\left(-\\frac{1}{1+1}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{1+1/2}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3/2} = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{-3+4}{6} = \\frac{1}{6}\n    $$\n    This integral is **finite**.\n2.  Integral of the speed density:\n    $$\n    S(r) = \\int_c^r m(x) dx = \\int_{1/2}^1 2(1+x)^2 dx = 2\\left[ \\frac{(1+x)^3}{3} \\right]_{1/2}^1 = 2\\left(\\frac{(1+1)^3}{3} - \\frac{(1+1/2)^3}{3}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{8}{3} - \\frac{9}{8}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{37}{24}\\right) = \\frac{37}{12}\n    $$\n    This integral is **finite**.\n\nAccording to the Feller boundary classification for the right boundary $r$:\n- $N(r)  \\infty$ and $S(r)  \\infty \\implies r$ is **regular**.\n- $N(r)  \\infty$ and $S(r) = \\infty \\implies r$ is **entrance**.\n- $N(r) = \\infty$ and $S(r)  \\infty \\implies r$ is **exit**.\n- $N(r) = \\infty$ and $S(r) = \\infty \\implies r$ is **natural**.\n(Note the swapped roles of entrance/exit for the right boundary compared to the left).\n\nSince both $N(1)$ and $S(1)$ are finite, the right boundary $1$ is **regular**.\n\nA simpler check is to note that the functions $b(x)=\\frac{1}{1+x}$ and $\\sigma(x)=1$ are well-defined and continuous on the closed interval $[0,1]$, and importantly, $\\sigma(x) \\neq 0$ at the boundaries. This is a sufficient condition for the boundaries to be regular.
