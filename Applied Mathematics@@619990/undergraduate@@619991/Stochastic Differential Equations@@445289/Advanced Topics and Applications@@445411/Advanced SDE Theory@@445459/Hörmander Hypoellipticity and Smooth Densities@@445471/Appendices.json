This is the smallest vector space of vector fields containing $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ and closed under the Lie bracket operation, $[A, B] = AB - BA$. We need to verify if the vector fields in $\\mathfrak{g}$, when evaluated at any point $(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, span the tangent space $T_{(x,y)}\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The tangent space is a two-dimensional vector space spanned by $\\{\\partial_x, \\partial_y\\}$.\n\nLet's evaluate the given vector fields. In vector form, $\\partial_x$ corresponds to $(1, 0)$ and $\\partial_y$ corresponds to $(0, 1)$. Thus, at any point $(x, y)$:\n$$\nV_{1}(x,y) = (1, 0)\n$$\n$$\nV_{2}(x,y) = (0, \\sin(x))\n$$\nThe vector field $V_1$ always provides the direction of the $x$-axis. To span the full tangent space $\\mathbb{R}^2$, we need a vector with a non-zero $y$-component. The vector field $V_2$ provides this, except at points where $\\sin(x) = 0$, i.e., where $x = k\\pi$ for an integer $k$. At these points, $V_2(x,y) = (0, 0)$, and the set $\\{V_1, V_2\\}$ only spans the $x$-direction.\n\nAccording to Hörmander's condition, we must then check higher-order Lie brackets. Let's compute the first-order bracket $[V_1, V_2]$. For an arbitrary smooth test function $f(x, y)$, we have:\n\\begin{align*}\n[V_1, V_2]f &= (V_1 V_2 - V_2 V_1)f \\\\\n&= \\partial_x (\\sin(x)\\partial_y f) - \\sin(x)\\partial_y(\\partial_x f) \\\\\n&= (\\partial_x \\sin(x))(\\partial_y f) + \\sin(x)(\\partial_x \\partial_y f) - \\sin(x)(\\partial_y \\partial_x f) \\\\\n&= \\cos(x)\\partial_y f + \\sin(x)\\partial_{xy}^2 f - \\sin(x)\\partial_{yx}^2 f\\end{align*}\nBy Schwarz's theorem (Clairaut's theorem) on the equality of mixed partials for smooth functions, $\\partial_{xy}^2 f = \\partial_{yx}^2 f$. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\n[V_1, V_2]f = \\cos(x)\\partial_y f\n$$\nThis implies that the commutator is the vector field $[V_1, V_2] = \\cos(x)\\partial_y$. Let's call this new vector field $V_{12}$. In vector form:\n$$\nV_{12}(x,y) = (0, \\cos(x))\n$$\nAt the points where $V_2$ failed to provide the $y$-direction (i.e., $x=k\\pi$), we check if $V_{12}$ can provide it. At $x=k\\pi$, we have $\\cos(k\\pi) = (-1)^k$, which is either $1$ or $-1$. In either case, $\\cos(k\\pi) \\neq 0$. Thus, at points where $V_2$ vanishes, $V_{12}$ is non-zero and points in the $y$-direction.\n\nThe problem asks us to relate this to the function $S(x) = \\sin^2(x) + \\cos^2(x)$. At any point $(x,y)$, the accessibility of the $y$-direction depends on the coefficients of $\\partial_y$ in the generating vector fields $V_2$ and $V_{12}$. These coefficients are $\\sin(x)$ and $\\cos(x)$, respectively. Hörmander's condition is satisfied if, at every point $x$, the vector space spanned by $\\{V_1(x,y), V_2(x,y), V_{12}(x,y), \\dots\\}$ is $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Since $V_1=(1,0)$ is constant, this is equivalent to requiring that there is some vector in the Lie algebra that has a non-zero $y$-component. This means that for any $x$, we cannot have all coefficients of $\\partial_y$ vanish simultaneously.\n\nThe coefficients of $\\partial_y$ in $V_2$ and $V_{12}$ are $\\sin(x)$ and $\\cos(x)$. The condition for failure to span would be that both are zero for the same $x$. The function $S(x)$ acts as a \"nondegeneracy witness\" because it is the sum of the squares of these coefficients:\n$$\nS(x) = (\\text{coeff of }\\partial_y \\text{ in } V_2)^2 + (\\text{coeff of }\\partial_y \\text{ in } V_{12})^2 = \\sin^2(x) + \\cos^2(x)\n$$\nIf $S(x) > 0$ for all $x$, it implies that $\\sin(x)$ and $\\cos(x)$ cannot both be zero simultaneously. This would guarantee that for any $x$, either $V_2$ or $V_{12}$ (or both) provides a non-zero component in the $y$-direction, which, together with $V_1$ providing the $x$-direction, ensures the full tangent space is spanned.\n\nWe now compute $S(x)$ in closed form. From the fundamental Pythagorean identity in trigonometry, for any real number $x$:\n$$\nS(x) = \\sin^2(x) + \\cos^2(x) = 1\n$$\nSince $S(x)=1$ for all $x$, $S(x)$ is never zero. This rigorously proves that for any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, at least one of $\\sin(x)$ or $\\cos(x)$ is non-zero. Consequently, at every point $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, the set of vectors $\\{V_1(x,y), V_2(x,y), [V_1, V_2](x,y)\\}$ spans the tangent space $T_{(x,y)}\\mathbb{R}^2$.

It presents a standard problem in the intersection of linear control theory and the theory of stochastic differential equations, specifically concerning the hypoellipticity of the associated generator. All necessary information is provided, and the task is clearly defined. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be constructed.\n\nThe problem asks us to analyze a two-dimensional linear Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE):\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}X_{t} = A X_{t} \\,\\mathrm{d}t + B \\,\\mathrm{d}W_{t}\n$$\nwhere $X_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, $W_{t}$ is a one-dimensional standard Brownian motion, and the matrices are given by:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\sigma \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwith $\\lambda, \\sigma \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nWe are tasked with constructing the Kalman controllability matrix $[B, AB]$ and finding its determinant. This quantity is crucial for determining both the controllability of the associated deterministic linear system and the applicability of Hörmander's condition for the hypoellipticity of the SDE's generator.\n\nFirst, let us establish the connection between these concepts. For a linear time-invariant system of the form $\\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)$, controllability is a property that ensures the system can be driven from any initial state to any final state in finite time. The Kalman rank condition states that the system is controllable if and only if the controllability matrix, $\\mathcal{C}$, has full rank. For an $n$-dimensional system, the controllability matrix is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} B & AB & A^2B & \\cdots & A^{n-1}B \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nIn our case, the state space is $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, so $n=2$. The Kalman matrix is $\\mathcal{C} = [B, AB]$. The system is controllable if and only if $\\mathrm{rank}(\\mathcal{C}) = 2$, which for a $2 \\times 2$ matrix is equivalent to its determinant being non-zero, i.e., $\\det(\\mathcal{C}) \\neq 0$.\n\nSecond, we consider Hörmander's condition for hypoellipticity. The generator, $\\mathcal{L}$, of the Itô diffusion $X_t$ is a second-order partial differential operator. For our linear SDE, the drift vector field is $Y_0(x) = Ax$ and the diffusion vector field (since $W_t$ is one-dimensional) is $Y_1(x) = B$. Hörmander's theorem states that the operator $\\mathcal{L}$ is hypoelliptic if the Lie algebra generated by the vector fields $\\{Y_0, Y_1\\}$ spans the tangent space at every point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. This means that the set of vector fields comprising $Y_1$ and its iterated Lie brackets with $Y_0$, i.e., $\\{Y_1, [Y_0, Y_1], [Y_0, [Y_0, Y_1]], \\dots \\}$, must span $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nLet us compute the first Lie bracket, $[Y_0, Y_1]$. For vector fields $Y_0 = \\sum_{i} (Ax)_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}$ and $Y_1 = \\sum_{j} B_j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j}$, the Lie bracket is given by $[Y_0, Y_1] = (\\nabla Y_1) Y_0 - (\\nabla Y_0) Y_1$. Since $Y_1 = B$ is a constant vector field, its Jacobian $\\nabla Y_1$ is the zero matrix. The Jacobian of the linear vector field $Y_0(x) = Ax$ is simply the matrix $A$. Therefore, the Lie bracket simplifies to:\n$$\n[Y_0, Y_1](x) = 0 - A B\n$$\nThis result is itself a constant vector field, $-AB$. Hörmander's condition is satisfied if the set of vectors $\\{B, -AB\\}$ are linearly independent. The negative sign on $AB$ does not affect linear independence. Thus, the condition reduces to checking if the vectors $B$ and $AB$ are linearly independent, which is precisely the Kalman controllability condition. The matrix whose columns are these vectors is the Kalman matrix $\\mathcal{C} = [B, AB]$.\n\nWe now proceed to calculate this matrix and its determinant.\nThe given matrices are:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\sigma \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFirst, we compute the product $AB$:\n$$\nAB = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\sigma \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (0)(0) + (1)(\\sigma) \\\\ (0)(0) + (-\\lambda)(\\sigma) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma \\\\ -\\lambda\\sigma \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we construct the Kalman controllability matrix $\\mathcal{C}$ by placing $B$ and $AB$ as its columns:\n$$\n\\mathcal{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} B & AB \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sigma \\\\ \\sigma & -\\lambda\\sigma \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe final step is to compute the determinant of this matrix:\n$$\n\\det(\\mathcal{C}) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sigma \\\\ \\sigma & -\\lambda\\sigma \\end{pmatrix} = (0)(-\\lambda\\sigma) - (\\sigma)(\\sigma) = 0 - \\sigma^2 = -\\sigma^2\n$$\nThe determinant of the Kalman matrix is $-\\sigma^2$.\n\nBased on this result, we can infer the conditions for controllability and hypoellipticity. The system is controllable if and only if $\\det(\\mathcal{C}) \\neq 0$, which means $-\\sigma^2 \\neq 0$, or simply $\\sigma \\neq 0$. Similarly, Hörmander's condition holds, and thus the generator $\\mathcal{L}$ is hypoelliptic, if and only if $\\sigma \\neq 0$. This implies that for any time $t > 0$, the probability distribution of $X_t$ has a smooth ($C^{\\infty}$) density function, provided that the diffusion coefficient $\\sigma$ is non-zero. The parameter $\\lambda$, which represents damping in the second component, does not affect the controllability or hypoellipticity of the system. The physical intuition is that noise must be directly injected into the 'velocity' component (the second component of $X_t$) for its effects to propagate to the 'position' component (the first component) and make the entire state fully randomized and controllable. If $\\sigma=0$, the noise term vanishes, and the system is deterministic and not stochastically excited.\n\nThe problem asks for the determinant of the Kalman matrix as a closed-form symbolic expression. This has been computed as $-\\sigma^2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\sigma^{2}}$$", "id": "3058890"}]}
