The key to a unique answer lies in using the *canonical* decomposition, where the finite variation part is required to be predictable.\n\nFirst, we must establish that $X_t$ is a martingale. A process is a martingale if it is adapted, integrable, and $\\mathbb{E}[X_t | \\mathcal{F}_s] = X_s$ for all $s  t$. The process $X_t$ is adapted and its expectation is $\\mathbb{E}[|X_t|] \\le \\mathbb{E}[N_t] + \\lambda t = 2\\lambda t  \\infty$, so it is integrable.

As a semimartingale, $B$ is a continuous local martingale. Hence $B$ has no jumps, so for all $s$, we have $\\Delta B_s = 0$, and the continuous part of $B$ is $B^c = B$ itself.\n\nSecond, $N$ is a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda  0$.

The second term vanishes because $\\Delta B_s = 0$ for all $s$ (Brownian motion has continuous paths), so every summand is zero regardless of $\\Delta N_s$.\n\nAn equivalent argument uses the foundational fact that the quadratic covariation of any continuous local martingale with any finite variation process is zero. Writing $N = \\lambda t + M$ with $\\lambda t$ of finite variation and $M$ purely discontinuous, we have $[B, \\lambda t]_t = 0$ and\n$$\n[B, M]_t \\;=\\; [B^c, M^c]_t \\;+\\; \\sum_{0  s \\le t} \\Delta B_s \\,\\Delta M_s \\;=\\; 0 \\;+\\; 0 \\;=\\; 0,\n$$\nso $[B,N]_t = 0 + 0 = 0$.\n\nInterpretation: Quadratic covariation measures the cumulative effect of simultaneous infinitesimal co-fluctuations (the continuous part) and products of simultaneous jumps. Brownian motion exhibits continuous fluctuations without jumps, whereas the Poisson process has only jump discontinuities and no continuous part.
