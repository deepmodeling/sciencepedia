The concepts of SDEs, Itô's formula, boundary classification, and the Lamperti transform are standard and well-established.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It asks a qualitative question about the invariance of boundary types under a specific class of transformations. The assumptions on $X_t$ and $\\phi$ are sufficient to allow for a rigorous analysis. The ambiguity of the boundary at $r$ is irrelevant to the question, which exclusively concerns the boundary at $\\ell$.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective mathematical language.\n-   **Conclusion:** The problem statement does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a valid, well-formulated question in stochastic analysis.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. We may proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation\nThe core of the problem is to determine if the nature of a boundary (absorbing or reflecting) is preserved under a strictly monotone change of variables $Y_t = \\phi(X_t)$. The analysis will be based on the fundamental pathwise definitions of these boundary types.\n\nThe function $\\phi: (\\ell, r) \\to (\\phi(\\ell+), \\phi(r-))$ is given as strictly monotone (since $\\phi'(x)  0$) and continuous. It extends continuously to the boundary points. This means $\\phi$ is a homeomorphism that maps the interval $[\\ell, r)$ to the interval $[\\phi(\\ell+), \\phi(r-))$. A key consequence is that there is a one-to-one correspondence between points in the state space of $X_t$ and points in the state space of $Y_t$. Specifically, for any time $t$:\n-   $X_t = \\ell \\iff Y_t = \\phi(\\ell+)$\n-   $X_t \\in (\\ell, r) \\iff Y_t \\in (\\phi(\\ell+), \\phi(r-))$\n\nSince the transformation $Y_t = \\phi(X_t)$ applies at every instant in time $t$ to the value of the process $X_t$, a sample path of $Y_t$ is simply the point-wise image of a sample path of $X_t$ under the map $\\phi$. The topological properties of the paths are therefore preserved.\n\n**1. Analysis of an Absorbing Boundary**\nAn absorbing boundary at $\\ell$ for the process $X_t$ is defined by the property that if a sample path reaches $\\ell$, it remains there for all future time.\nLet $\\tau_{\\ell} = \\inf\\{t  0 : X_t = \\ell\\}$ be the first hitting time of the boundary $\\ell$. If the boundary is absorbing, then for a given sample path where $\\tau_{\\ell}  \\infty$, we have $X_t = \\ell$ for all $t \\geq \\tau_{\\ell}$.\n\nNow consider the transformed process $Y_t = \\phi(X_t)$. The first hitting time of $\\phi(\\ell+)$ for $Y_t$ is $\\tau_{\\phi(\\ell+)} = \\inf\\{t  0 : Y_t = \\phi(\\ell+)\\}$. Due to the homeomorphic nature of $\\phi$, $Y_t = \\phi(\\ell+)$ if and only if $X_t = \\ell$. Therefore, the hitting times are identical: $\\tau_{\\phi(\\ell+)} = \\tau_{\\ell}$.\n\nFor all $t \\geq \\tau_{\\ell}$, we have $X_t = \\ell$. Applying the transformation $\\phi$ yields:\n$$Y_t = \\phi(X_t) = \\phi(\\ell+) \\quad \\text{for all } t \\geq \\tau_{\\ell} = \\tau_{\\phi(\\ell+)}$$\nThis is precisely the definition of an absorbing boundary for the process $Y_t$ at the point $\\phi(\\ell+)$. Thus, an absorbing boundary is preserved under the transformation.\n\n**2. Analysis of a Reflecting Boundary**\nA reflecting boundary at $\\ell$ is characterized by the property that the process does not get \"stuck\" at the boundary. Upon reaching $\\ell$, it is immediately sent back into the interior $(\\ell, r)$. Pathwise, this means that for a typical path, the set of times $\\{t : X_t(\\omega) = \\ell\\}$ has Lebesgue measure zero. A path may touch the boundary but does not spend any positive amount of time there.\n\nConsider a sample path of $X_t$ that touches the reflecting boundary $\\ell$ at time $t_0$. This means $X_{t_0} = \\ell$, but the process does not stay at $\\ell$. For any $\\delta  0$, there exists a time $t_1 \\in (t_0, t_0+\\delta)$ such that $X_{t_1}  \\ell$.\n\nNow examine the corresponding path for $Y_t = \\phi(X_t)$. At time $t_0$, we have $Y_{t_0} = \\phi(X_{t_0}) = \\phi(\\ell+)$. At time $t_1$, we have $Y_{t_1} = \\phi(X_{t_1})$. Since $X_{t_1}  \\ell$ and $\\phi$ is strictly increasing ($\\phi'  0$), it follows that $\\phi(X_{t_1})  \\phi(\\ell+)$, so $Y_{t_1}  \\phi(\\ell+)$.\n\nThis shows that the process $Y_t$ does not remain at the boundary $\\phi(\\ell+)$ after hitting it. It is immediately sent back into the interior $(\\phi(\\ell+), \\phi(r-))$. This is the definition of a reflecting boundary for $Y_t$. Thus, a reflecting boundary is also preserved.\n\nThe problem asks to use the consequences of applying Itô's formula. Applying Itô's formula to $Y_t = \\phi(X_t)$ gives the SDE for $Y_t$:\n$$ dY_t = \\left[ \\phi'(X_t) b(X_t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\phi''(X_t) \\sigma(X_t)^2 \\right] dt + \\phi'(X_t) \\sigma(X_t) dW_t $$\nThis can be written as $dY_t = b_Y(Y_t) dt + \\sigma_Y(Y_t) dW_t$ by substituting $X_t = \\phi^{-1}(Y_t)$. Although the drift $b_Y$ and diffusion $\\sigma_Y$ coefficients are different from $b$ and $\\sigma$, the solutions to this new SDE must, by construction, be the paths $Y_t = \\phi(X_t)$. Therefore, the pathwise behavior, including at the boundaries, is determined by the mapping $\\phi$ and the behavior of $X_t$. The change in coefficients cannot alter the topological equivalence established by the mapping itself.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Under the stated assumptions, an absorbing boundary at $\\ell$ for $X_t$ becomes an absorbing boundary at $\\phi(\\ell+)$ for $Y_t$, and a reflecting boundary at $\\ell$ for $X_t$ becomes a reflecting boundary at $\\phi(\\ell+)$ for $Y_t$.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with the derivation above. The strictly monotone, continuous state transformation $\\phi$ acts as a homeomorphism on the state space, which preserves the fundamental pathwise properties that define absorbing and reflecting boundaries.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. An absorbing boundary at $\\ell$ for $X_t$ becomes a reflecting boundary at $\\phi(\\ell+)$ for $Y_t$ because the drift in the transformed coordinates alters the probability current sign near the boundary.**\nThis statement is incorrect. As shown in the derivation, an absorbing boundary remains absorbing. A path that is trapped at a boundary point cannot become \"un-trapped\" by a mere relabeling of that state. While the transformed drift $b_Y$ is indeed different from $b$, it cannot override the fundamental pathwise equivalence between the two processes.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. A reflecting boundary at $\\ell$ for $X_t$ is converted into an absorbing boundary at $\\phi(\\ell+)$ for $Y_t$ if and only if $\\phi'(\\ell)=0$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. First, the condition should be interpreted as $\\lim_{x \\downarrow \\ell} \\phi'(x) = 0$, since $\\phi'$ is defined on $(\\ell, r)$. If this limit is $0$, the transformed diffusion coefficient $\\sigma_Y(y) = \\phi'(\\phi^{-1}(y)) \\sigma(\\phi^{-1}(y))$ would vanish at the boundary $y \\to \\phi(\\ell+)$. While a zero diffusion coefficient at a boundary is a feature of some SDEs with absorbing boundaries (e.g., the CIR model at $0$), it cannot change the nature of the boundary in this context. The pathwise argument still holds: a path of $X_t$ that reflects from $\\ell$ is mapped to a path of $Y_t$ that reflects from $\\phi(\\ell+)$. The boundary type is preserved regardless of the limiting behavior of $\\phi'(x)$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Neither absorbing nor reflecting boundary types are preserved under any non-linear strictly monotone transform; the boundary classification generally changes under state transformations.**\nThis is a strong, general claim that is false. The derivation shows that both absorbing and reflecting boundary types are, in fact, preserved under any transformation that is a homeomorphism on the state space, which includes all transformations satisfying the conditions of the problem (strictly monotone, continuous). The non-linearity of the transform (i.e., $\\phi''(x) \\neq 0$) affects the drift but not the topological nature of the boundary.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3063402"}]}
