Just as learning classical calculus begins with differentiating basic functions like polynomials, our journey starts by applying the Malliavin derivative operator $D$ to the fundamental building blocks of random variables on Wiener space. This exercise demonstrates through a rigorous approximation argument the elegant and intuitive rule for this operation, providing a powerful tool for all subsequent computations.

Provide only the final expression for $D_{t}F$ as your answer.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is a well-posed question within the established mathematical framework of Malliavin calculus. The definitions are standard, and the premises are scientifically sound. We shall proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe objective is to compute the Malliavin derivative $D_{t}F$ for the random variable $F$ defined by the Wiener integral $F = \\int_{0}^{T}\\phi(t)\\,dW_{t}$, where $\\phi \\in L^{2}([0,T])$ is a deterministic function.\n\nThe provided definition of the Malliavin derivative applies to random variables in the class $\\mathcal{S}$ of smooth cylindrical random variables. A general Wiener integral, such as $F$, is not necessarily an element of $\\mathcal{S}$. For instance, if we choose $\\phi(t) = h_{1}(t)$, then $F = W(h_1) = g(W(h_1))$ where $g(x) = x$. The function $g$ is not in $C_{b}^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R})$ as its derivatives, while bounded, are not all zero, and the function itself is not bounded.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that the domain of the Malliavin derivative operator $D$ is the Sobolev space $\\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$, which is defined as the closure of $\\mathcal{S}$ with respect to the norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_{1,2}$. The fact that $D$ is a closable operator is key. This means that if we can find a sequence of random variables $\\{F_{n}\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ that are in the domain of $D$ such that $F_{n} \\to F$ in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$ and the sequence of derivatives $\\{DF_{n}\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ converges in $L^{2}(\\Omega\\times[0,T])$, then $F$ is in the domain of $D$ ($\\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$), and its derivative is the limit of the sequence of derivatives: $DF = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} DF_{n}$.\n\nOur strategy is to construct such an approximating sequence. Since $\\phi \\in L^{2}([0,T])$, we can approximate $\\phi$ in the $L^{2}$-norm by a sequence of functions that give rise to random variables for which the derivative is easily computed. Let $\\{e_{k}\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ be a complete orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space $L^{2}([0,T])$. We can express $\\phi$ as a series:\n$$\n\\phi(t) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\langle \\phi, e_{k} \\rangle_{L^{2}} e_{k}(t),\n$$\nwhere the convergence is in the $L^{2}([0,T])$ norm.\n\nLet us define a sequence of partial sums $\\{\\phi_{n}\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$:\n$$\n\\phi_{n}(t) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\langle \\phi, e_{k} \\rangle_{L^{2}} e_{k}(t).\n$$\nBy construction, $\\|\\phi - \\phi_{n}\\|_{L^{2}([0,T])} \\to 0$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\nNow, we define a sequence of random variables $\\{F_{n}\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ corresponding to the approximating functions $\\{\\phi_{n}\\}$:\n$$\nF_{n} = \\int_{0}^{T} \\phi_{n}(t) \\, dW_{t}.\n$$\nUsing the linearity of the Wiener integral, we can write $F_{n}$ as:\n$$\nF_{n} = \\int_{0}^{T} \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\langle \\phi, e_{k} \\rangle_{L^{2}} e_{k}(t) \\right) dW_{t} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\langle \\phi, e_{k} \\rangle_{L^{2}} \\int_{0}^{T} e_{k}(t) \\, dW_{t} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\langle \\phi, e_{k} \\rangle_{L^{2}} W(e_{k}).\n$$\nEach $F_{n}$ is a finite linear combination of Wiener integrals. $F_n$ can be expressed as $g_n(W(e_{1}), \\dots, W(e_{n}))$, where $g_{n}: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is the linear function $g_{n}(x_{1}, \\dots, x_{n}) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\langle \\phi, e_{k} \\rangle_{L^{2}} x_{k}$. While this function $g_n$ is in $C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, it is not in $C_{b}^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ because it is unbounded. However, the definition of the Malliavin derivative on $\\mathcal{S}$ naturally extends to the algebra of polynomials in Wiener integrals, which is a core for the operator $D$. We proceed by applying the given formula, which is standard practice in this context. The partial derivatives of $g_{n}$ are constants:\n$$\n\\partial_{i} g_{n}(x_{1}, \\dots, x_{n}) = \\langle \\phi, e_{i} \\rangle_{L^{2}} \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}.\n$$\nUsing the definition of the Malliavin derivative for smooth cylindrical random variables, we compute $D_{t}F_{n}$:\n$$\nD_{t}F_{n} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\partial_{i}g_{n}\\big(W(e_{1}), \\dots, W(e_{n})\\big) \\, e_{i}(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\langle \\phi, e_{i} \\rangle_{L^{2}} e_{i}(t).\n$$\nWe recognize the expression on the right-hand side as the definition of $\\phi_{n}(t)$. Thus, we have the remarkable result that the Malliavin derivative of $F_{n}$ is the deterministic function $\\phi_{n}(t)$:\n$$\nD_{t}F_{n} = \\phi_{n}(t).\n$$\nNext, we must show that $F_{n} \\to F$ in the $\\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$ norm. The squared norm is $\\|G\\|_{1,2}^{2} = \\mathbb{E}[G^{2}] + \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T}|D_{s}G|^{2}\\,ds\\right]$. We need to show that $\\{F_{n}\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in this norm.\nConsider $\\|F_{n} - F_{m}\\|_{1,2}^{2}$ for $n > m$:\n$$\n\\|F_{n} - F_{m}\\|_{1,2}^{2} = \\mathbb{E}[(F_{n}-F_{m})^{2}] + \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T} |D_{t}F_{n} - D_{t}F_{m}|^{2} \\, dt\\right].\n$$\nFor the first term, we use the Itô isometry:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[(F_{n}-F_{m})^{2}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\int_{0}^{T}(\\phi_{n}(t) - \\phi_{m}(t))\\,dW_{t}\\right)^{2}\\right] = \\int_{0}^{T}|\\phi_{n}(t) - \\phi_{m}(t)|^{2}\\,dt = \\|\\phi_{n} - \\phi_{m}\\|_{L^{2}([0,T])}^{2}.\n$$\nFor the second term, we substitute the derivatives we found:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T} |D_{t}F_{n} - D_{t}F_{m}|^{2} \\, dt\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T} |\\phi_{n}(t) - \\phi_{m}(t)|^{2} \\, dt\\right].\n$$\nSince the integrand is deterministic, the expectation is trivial:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T} |\\phi_{n}(t) - \\phi_{m}(t)|^{2} \\, dt\\right] = \\int_{0}^{T} |\\phi_{n}(t) - \\phi_{m}(t)|^{2} \\, dt = \\|\\phi_{n} - \\phi_{m}\\|_{L^{2}([0,T])}^{2}.\n$$\nCombining both terms:\n$$\n\\|F_{n} - F_{m}\\|_{1,2}^{2} = 2\\|\\phi_{n} - \\phi_{m}\\|_{L^{2}([0,T])}^{2}.\n$$\nSince $\\{\\phi_{n}\\}$ is a convergent sequence in $L^{2}([0,T])$, it is a Cauchy sequence. Therefore, $\\|\\phi_{n} - \\phi_{m}\\|_{L^{2}([0,T])}^{2} \\to 0$ as $n, m \\to \\infty$. This implies that $\\{F_{n}\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$. Since $\\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$ is a Hilbert space, it is complete, so the sequence $\\{F_{n}\\}$ converges to a limit in $\\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$.\n\nWe must identify this limit. We already know that $\\|F - F_{n}\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2} = \\|\\phi - \\phi_{n}\\|_{L^{2}([0,T])}^{2} \\to 0$, so $F_{n} \\to F$ in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$. Therefore, the limit of $\\{F_{n}\\}$ in $\\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$ is indeed $F$.\n\nBy the definition of the derivative for elements in $\\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$ via the closedness of $D$, the derivative $DF$ is the limit of the sequence $\\{DF_{n}\\}$ in the space $L^{2}(\\Omega \\times [0,T])$. Let's compute this limit. We want to find a function $H(t)$ such that $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T} |D_{t}F_{n} - H(t)|^{2} dt\\right] \\to 0$. We propose $H(t) = \\phi(t)$.\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T} |D_{t}F_{n} - \\phi(t)|^{2} \\, dt\\right] = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T} |\\phi_{n}(t) - \\phi(t)|^{2} \\, dt\\right].\n$$\nAgain, the integrand is deterministic:\n$$\n= \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\int_{0}^{T} |\\phi_{n}(t) - \\phi(t)|^{2} \\, dt = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\|\\phi_{n} - \\phi\\|_{L^{2}([0,T])}^{2} = 0.\n$$\nThis shows that the sequence of derivatives $\\{D F_{n}\\}$ converges to $\\phi$ in $L^{2}(\\Omega \\times [0,T])$. Therefore, by the definition of the Malliavin derivative on $\\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$:\n$$\nD_{t}F = \\phi(t).\n$$\nThe result is an explicit, closed-form analytic expression in $t$, as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\phi(t)}$$", "id": "3064902"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the derivative operator $D$, we now turn to its dual, the divergence or Skorokhod integral, denoted by $\\delta$.

The Malliavin derivative of $W_T$ is $D_t W_T = 1$ for all $t \\in [0, T]$.\n$$\nD_t(F W_T) = F(D_t W_T) + W_T(D_t F) = F \\cdot 1 + W_T(D_t F) = F + W_T(D_t F)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the integral on the right-hand side:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[F W_T^2] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T} (F + W_T D_t F) \\, dt\\right]\n$$\nBy linearity of expectation and integration, we can split the right-hand side:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[F W_T^2] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T} F \\, dt\\right] + \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T} W_T D_t F \\, dt\\right]\n$$\nSince $F$ does not depend on the integration variable $t$, $\\int_0^T F \\, dt = F \\int_0^T dt = F T$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[F W_T^2] = \\mathbb{E}[F T] + \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T} W_T D_t F \\, dt\\right]\n$$\nRearranging this equation to isolate the term that appears in the duality relation for $\\delta(W_T)$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T} (D_t F) W_T \\, dt\\right] = \\mathbb{E}[F W_T^2] - \\mathbb{E}[F T] = \\mathbb{E}[F(W_T^2 - T)]\n$$\nNow we compare this with the original duality relation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[F\\,\\delta(W_T)] = \\mathbb{E}[F(W_T^2 - T)]\n$$\nSince this equality must hold for all suitable test random variables $F$, we can identify the random variables inside the expectations:\n$$\n\\delta(u) = \\delta(W_T) = W_T^2 - T\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Computation of the Itô integral $\\int_{0}^{T}u_{t}\\,dW_{t}$**\n\nFor this part, we are working in the enlarged filtration $\\mathcal{F}^*_t = \\sigma(\\mathcal{F}^W_t, W_T)$. In this filtration, the random variable $W_T$ is measurable for any $t \\in [0,T]$. Therefore, the process $u_t = W_T$ is an $\\mathcal{F}^*_t$-adapted process.\n\nThe problem asks to compute the Itô integral $\\int_{0}^{T} u_t \\, dW_t = \\int_{0}^{T} W_T \\, dW_t$. The Itô integral $\\int_0^T X_s dY_s$ of an adapted process $X$ with respect to a semimartingale $Y$ is defined as the limit in probability of the discrete sums over a partition $0 = t_0 < t_1 < \\dots < t_n = T$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} X_{t_i} (Y_{t_{i+1}} - Y_{t_i})\n$$\nIn our case, the integrand is $X_t = u_t = W_T$ and the integrator is $Y_t = W_t$. The integrand $W_T$ is constant with respect to the time index $t_i$. Thus, for any partition, the approximating sum is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} u_{t_i} (W_{t_{i+1}} - W_{t_i}) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} W_T (W_{t_{i+1}} - W_{t_i})\n$$\nWe can factor out the random variable $W_T$ from the sum:\n$$\nW_T \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (W_{t_{i+1}} - W_{t_i})\n$$\nThe sum is a telescoping series:\n$$\n(W_{t_1} - W_{t_0}) + (W_{t_2} - W_{t_1}) + \\dots + (W_{t_n} - W_{t_{n-1}}) = W_{t_n} - W_{t_0}\n$$\nGiven the partition goes from $0$ to $T$, we have $t_0 = 0$ and $t_n = T$. Since $W$ is a standard Wiener process, $W_0=0$. The sum evaluates to $W_T - 0 = W_T$.\nTherefore, the approximating sum for any partition is exactly:\n$$\nW_T \\cdot W_T = W_T^2\n$$\nSince the approximating sums are constant and equal to $W_T^2$ for any partition, the limit in probability is also $W_T^2$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} u_{t} \\, dW_{t} = W_T^2\n$$\nThis result highlights the distinction between the Skorokhod integral, which is a form of anticipating integral, and the classical Itô integral defined within a filtration where the integrand is adapted.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe first entry is $\\delta(u) = W_T^2 - T$ and the second entry is $\\int_{0}^{T}u_{t}\\,dW_{t} = W_T^2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nW_T^2 - T & W_T^2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3064905"}]}
