Derive an upper bound on $\\|M_{1}\\|_{L^{2}}$ in terms of $\\|[M]_{1}^{1/2}\\|_{L^{2}}$ using Doob's maximal inequality.\n3.  Compute the ratio of the upper bound to the exact value.\n\nLet us address each part systematically.\n\n**Part 1: Exact relationship between $\\|M_{1}\\|_{L^{2}}$ and $\\|[M]_{1}^{1/2}\\|_{L^{2}}$**\n\nThe $L^{2}$ norm of the martingale at time $t=1$ is given by $\\|M_{1}\\|_{L^{2}} = (\\mathbb{E}[M_{1}^2])^{1/2}$.\nThe martingale is $M_{1} = \\int_{0}^{1} s \\, dW_{s}$. The integrand $f(t, \\omega) = t$ is a deterministic function of time. We can apply the Itô isometry for deterministic integrands, which states that for a function $f \\in L^2([0,T])$,\n$$ \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\int_{0}^{T} f(t) \\, dW_{t}\\right)^2\\right] = \\int_{0}^{T} f(t)^2 \\, dt $$\nIn our case, $T=1$ and $f(t)=t$. Thus,\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[M_{1}^2] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\int_{0}^{1} s \\, dW_{s}\\right)^2\\right] = \\int_{0}^{1} s^2 \\, ds $$\nThe quadratic variation of the Itô integral $M_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} H_s \\, dW_s$ is given by $[M]_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} H_s^2 \\, ds$. For our specific martingale, the integrand is $H_s = s$, so the quadratic variation is:\n$$ [M]_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} s^2 \\, ds $$\nAt time $t=1$, the quadratic variation is a deterministic quantity:\n$$ [M]_{1} = \\int_{0}^{1} s^2 \\, ds = \\left[\\frac{s^3}{3}\\right]_{0}^{1} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nFrom the Itô isometry result, we see that $\\mathbb{E}[M_{1}^2] = [M]_{1}$.\nTherefore, the $L^2$ norm of $M_1$ is:\n$$ \\|M_{1}\\|_{L^{2}} = (\\mathbb{E}[M_{1}^2])^{1/2} = ([M]_{1})^{1/2} $$\nNow, let's evaluate the term $\\|[M]_{1}^{1/2}\\|_{L^{2}}$. By definition of the $L^2$ norm:\n$$ \\|[M]_{1}^{1/2}\\|_{L^{2}} = \\left(\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left([M]_{1}^{1/2}\\right)^2\\right]\\right)^{1/2} = (\\mathbb{E}[[M]_{1}])^{1/2} $$\nSince $[M]_{1}$ is a deterministic constant ($[M]_1 = 1/3$), its expectation is the constant itself: $\\mathbb{E}[[M]_{1}] = [M]_{1}$.\nSo, we have:\n$$ \\|[M]_{1}^{1/2}\\|_{L^{2}} = ([M]_{1})^{1/2} $$\nComparing the expressions for $\\|M_{1}\\|_{L^{2}}$ and $\\|[M]_{1}^{1/2}\\|_{L^{2}}$, we find they are identical:\n$$ \\|M_{1}\\|_{L^{2}} = \\|[M]_{1}^{1/2}\\|_{L^{2}} $$\nThis establishes the exact relationship. The coefficient is $1$.\n\n**Part 2: Upper bound on $\\|M_{1}\\|_{L^{2}}$ using Doob's maximal inequality**\n\nWe are instructed to use the trivial inequality $|M_{1}| \\leq \\sup_{0 \\leq t \\leq 1} |M_{t}|$ along with Doob's $L^{2}$ maximal inequality.\nDoob's $L^{2}$ maximal inequality for a continuous martingale $\\{N_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ states that for any $T > 0$,\n$$ \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sup_{0 \\leq t \\leq T} |N_{t}|^2\\right] \\leq 4 \\, \\mathbb{E}[|N_{T}|^2] $$\nApplying this to our martingale $M_t$ over the interval $[0,1]$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sup_{0 \\leq t \\leq 1} |M_{t}|^2\\right] \\leq 4 \\, \\mathbb{E}[M_{1}^2] $$\nNow, from Part 1, we know by Itô isometry that $\\mathbb{E}[M_{1}^2] = [M]_{1}$. Since $[M]_{1}$ is deterministic, we also have $\\mathbb{E}[M_{1}^2] = \\mathbb{E}[[M]_1]$.\nSubstituting this into Doob's inequality:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sup_{0 \\leq t \\leq 1} |M_{t}|^2\\right] \\leq 4 \\, \\mathbb{E}[[M]_{1}] $$\nTaking the square root of both sides gives an inequality for the $L^2$ norms:\n$$ \\left(\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sup_{0 \\leq t \\leq 1} |M_{t}|^2\\right]\\right)^{1/2} \\leq \\left(4 \\, \\mathbb{E}[[M]_{1}]\\right)^{1/2} $$\n$$ \\|\\sup_{0 \\leq t \\leq 1} |M_{t}|\\|_{L^{2}} \\leq 2 \\, (\\mathbb{E}[[M]_{1}])^{1/2} = 2 \\, \\|[M]_{1}^{1/2}\\|_{L^{2}} $$\nNow we use the trivial inequality $|M_{1}| \\leq \\sup_{0 \\leq t \\leq 1} |M_{t}|$. Squaring both sides and taking expectations, we get:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[|M_{1}|^2] \\leq \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sup_{0 \\leq t \\leq 1} |M_{t}|^2\\right] $$\nIn terms of $L^2$ norms, this is $\\|M_{1}\\|_{L^2} \\leq \\|\\sup_{0 \\le t \\le 1} |M_{t}|\\|_{L^2}$.\nCombining this with the result from Doob's inequality, we form a chain of inequalities:\n$$ \\|M_{1}\\|_{L^{2}} \\leq \\|\\sup_{0 \\leq t \\leq 1} |M_{t}|\\|_{L^{2}} \\leq 2 \\, \\|[M]_{1}^{1/2}\\|_{L^{2}} $$\nThis yields the desired upper bound on $\\|M_{1}\\|_{L^{2}}$ in terms of $\\|[M]_{1}^{1/2}\\|_{L^{2}}$:\n$$ \\|M_{1}\\|_{L^{2}} \\leq 2 \\, \\|[M]_{1}^{1/2}\\|_{L^{2}} $$\n\n**Part 3: Ratio of the upper bound to the exact value**\n\nFrom Part 1, the exact value expression is $\\|M_{1}\\|_{L^{2}} = 1 \\cdot \\|[M]_{1}^{1/2}\\|_{L^{2}}$. Let's call the exact value $V_{\\text{exact}} = \\|[M]_{1}^{1/2}\\|_{L^{2}}$.\nFrom Part 2, we derived an upper bound for $\\|M_{1}\\|_{L^{2}}$, which is $2 \\cdot \\|[M]_{1}^{1/2}\\|_{L^{2}}$. Let's call this upper bound value $V_{\\text{bound}} = 2 \\, \\|[M]_{1}^{1/2}\\|_{L^{2}}$.\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the upper bound to the exact value. This can be interpreted as the ratio of the constants in the two relationships. Alternatively, we are comparing the value of the bound $V_{\\text{bound}}$ to the actual value of the quantity being bounded, $V_{\\text{exact}} = \\|M_{1}\\|_{L^{2}}$.\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{V_{\\text{bound}}}{V_{\\text{exact}}} = \\frac{2 \\, \\|[M]_{1}^{1/2}\\|_{L^{2}}}{\\|[M]_{1}^{1/2}\\|_{L^{2}}} $$\nSince $[M]_{1} = 1/3 > 0$, the norm $\\|[M]_{1}^{1/2}\\|_{L^{2}} = (1/3)^{1/2}$ is non-zero, so the division is well-defined.\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = 2 $$\nThe ratio of the upper bound obtained from Doob's inequality to the exact value is $2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "3042986"}, {"introduction": "The BDG inequalities link the moments of a martingale's maximum to its quadratic variation.

We verify the defining properties:\n1.  **Initial Value**: At $s=0$, we have $B_{0} = T^{-1/2} W_{T \\cdot 0} = T^{-1/2} W_{0}$. Since $W_{0} = 0$, it follows that $B_{0} = 0$.\n2.  **Continuity of Paths**: The function $s \\mapsto Ts$ is continuous for $s \\in [0,1]$. Since $\\{W_t\\}$ has continuous sample paths, the composition $s \\mapsto W_{Ts}$ is a continuous function of $s$. Multiplication by the constant $T^{-1/2}$ preserves continuity. Therefore, $\\{B_s\\}$ has continuous sample paths.\n3.  **Stationary and Independent Increments**: Let's consider increments of $B_s$. For any $0 \\le u < s \\le 1$, the increment is:\n    $$B_{s} - B_{u} = T^{-1/2} W_{Ts} - T^{-1/2} W_{Tu} = T^{-1/2} (W_{Ts} - W_{Tu})$$\n    a. **Independence**: Let $0 \\le u_1 < s_1 \\le u_2 < s_2 \\le 1$. The corresponding time intervals for the process $W$ are $[Tu_1, Ts_1]$ and $[Tu_2, Ts_2]$. Since $T > 0$, these intervals $[Tu_1, Ts_1]$ and $[Tu_2, Ts_2]$ are non-overlapping. The increments of $W$, namely $W_{Ts_1} - W_{Tu_1}$ and $W_{Ts_2} - W_{Tu_2}$, are independent by the definition of Brownian motion. The increments of $B$, being constant multiples of these, are therefore also independent.\n    b. **Stationarity and Distribution**: The increment $W_{Ts} - W_{Tu}$ depends on the time interval of length $Ts - Tu = T(s-u)$. By the stationary increments property of $W$, the distribution of $W_{Ts} - W_{Tu}$ is the same as the distribution of $W_{T(s-u)} - W_0 = W_{T(s-u)}$. We know that $W_{t'}$ is a centered Gaussian with variance $t'$. Thus, $W_{T(s-u)}$ is a centered Gaussian with variance $T(s-u)$.\n    The increment $B_s - B_u$ is a scaling of this Gaussian variable:\n    $$B_s - B_u \\sim T^{-1/2} \\mathcal{N}(0, T(s-u))$$\n    A linear transformation of a Gaussian random variable is also Gaussian. The mean remains $T^{-1/2} \\cdot 0 = 0$. The variance is:\n    $$\\mathbb{E}[(B_s - B_u)^2] = \\mathbb{E}[(T^{-1/2}(W_{Ts} - W_{Tu}))^2] = T^{-1} \\mathbb{E}[(W_{Ts} - W_{Tu})^2] = T^{-1} \\text{Var}(W_{T(s-u)}) = T^{-1} (T(s-u)) = s-u$$\n    So, the increment $B_s - B_u$ is a centered Gaussian random variable with variance $s-u$. This distribution depends only on the length of the interval, $s-u$.\n\nAll defining properties are satisfied, so $\\{B_{s}\\}_{s \\in [0,1]}$ is a standard Brownian motion on $[0,1]$.\n\nNext, we relate the random variables $\\sup_{t \\le T} |W_{t}|$ and $\\sup_{s \\le 1} |B_{s}|$. From the definition $B_{s} = T^{-1/2} W_{Ts}$, we can write $W_{Ts} = T^{1/2} B_s$. Let $t=Ts$. As $s$ varies over the interval $[0,1]$, $t$ varies over the interval $[0,T]$. We can therefore write:\n$$\\sup_{t \\in [0,T]} |W_{t}| = \\sup_{s \\in [0,1]} |W_{Ts}|$$\nSubstituting the relationship $W_{Ts} = T^{1/2} B_s$:\n$$\\sup_{t \\in [0,T]} |W_{t}| = \\sup_{s \\in [0,1]} |T^{1/2} B_s|$$\nSince $T^{1/2}$ is a positive constant, it can be factored out of the supremum:\n$$\\sup_{t \\in [0,T]} |W_{t}| = T^{1/2} \\sup_{s \\in [0,1]} |B_{s}|$$\nThis equation establishes the relationship between the two random variables.\n\nNow, we deduce the expression for $\\mathbb{E}[\\sup_{t \\le T} |W_{t}|^{p}]$. We take the $p$-th power of the equality above and then compute the expectation:\n$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\sup_{t \\le T} |W_{t}|\\right)^p\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(T^{1/2} \\sup_{s \\le 1} |B_{s}|\\right)^p\\right]$$\nUsing the linearity of expectation to factor out the constant $(T^{1/2})^p = T^{p/2}$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sup_{t \\le T} |W_{t}|^{p}\\right] = T^{p/2} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\sup_{s \\le 1} |B_{s}|\\right)^p\\right]$$\nWe have established that $\\{B_{s}\\}_{s \\in [0,1]}$ is a standard Brownian motion. This means that the law of the process $\\{B_s\\}_{s \\in [0,1]}$ is identical to the law of the process $\\{W_s\\}_{s \\in [0,1]}$. Consequently, the distribution of any functional of the process path is the same for both. In particular, the random variable $\\sup_{s \\le 1} |B_{s}|$ has the same distribution as the random variable $\\sup_{s \\le 1} |W_{s}|$. Therefore, their moments must be equal:\n$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\sup_{s \\le 1} |B_{s}|\\right)^p\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\sup_{s \\le 1} |W_{s}|\\right)^p\\right]$$\nSubstituting this back into our expression, we arrive at the final result:\n$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sup_{t \\le T} |W_{t}|^{p}\\right] = T^{p/2} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sup_{s \\le 1} |W_{s}|^{p}\\right]$$\n\nFinally, we explain the connection to the Burkholder-Davis-Gundy (BDG) inequalities. For a continuous local martingale $M_t$ with $M_0=0$, the BDG inequalities state that for $p \\in (0, \\infty)$, there exist constants $c_p$ and $C_p$ such that for any stopping time $\\tau$:\n$$c_p \\mathbb{E}[[ M ]_{\\tau}^{p/2}] \\le \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\sup_{t \\le \\tau} |M_t|\\right)^p\\right] \\le C_p \\mathbb{E}[[ M ]_{\\tau}^{p/2}]$$\nStandard Brownian motion $W_t$ is a continuous martingale. Its quadratic variation is given by $[W]_t = t$. For the fixed time $\\tau = T$, the quadratic variation $[W]_T = T$ is a deterministic quantity. The BDG inequalities for Brownian motion thus become:\n$$c_p \\mathbb{E}[T^{p/2}] \\le \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\sup_{t \\le T} |W_t|\\right)^p\\right] \\le C_p \\mathbb{E}[T^{p/2}]$$\nSince $T$ is a constant, $\\mathbb{E}[T^{p/2}] = T^{p/2}$. Therefore, the BDG inequalities predict:\n$$c_p T^{p/2} \\le \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sup_{t \\le T} |W_{t}|^{p}\\right] \\le C_p T^{p/2}$$\nThis implies that $\\mathbb{E}[\\sup_{t \\le T} |W_{t}|^{p}]$ must be proportional to $T^{p/2}$. Our derived equality, $\\mathbb{E}[\\sup_{t \\le T} |W_{t}|^{p}] = (\\mathbb{E}[\\sup_{s \\le 1} |W_{s}|^{p}]) T^{p/2}$, confirms this prediction exactly. The constant of proportionality is identified as $\\mathbb{E}[\\sup_{s \\le 1} |W_{s}|^{p}]$, a finite constant that depends only on $p$.
