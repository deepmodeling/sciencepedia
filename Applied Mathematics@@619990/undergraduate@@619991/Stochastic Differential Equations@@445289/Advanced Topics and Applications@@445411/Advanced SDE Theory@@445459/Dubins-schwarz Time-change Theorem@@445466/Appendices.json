We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of the predictable quadratic variation processes for two specific continuous martingales, $M_{t}$ and $N_{t}$, and to connect these results to the Dubins–Schwarz time-change theorem and the Itô isometry.\n\nLet $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},(\\mathcal{F}_{t})_{t\\ge 0},\\mathbb{P})$ be a filtered probability space supporting a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion $W=(W_{t})_{t\\ge 0}$. The martingales are defined as $M_{t}=W_{t}$ and $N_{t}=\\int_{0}^{t}\\sigma\\,dW_{s}$ for a constant $\\sigma\\in\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe predictable quadratic variation of a continuous local martingale $X$, denoted $\\langle X \\rangle_{t}$, is the unique, non-decreasing, predictable process starting at $0$ such that $X_{t}^{2} - \\langle X \\rangle_{t}$ is a continuous local martingale. For Itô processes of the form $dX_{t} = H_{t} dW_{t}$, where $H_{t}$ is a predictable process, the predictable quadratic variation is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\langle X \\rangle_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} H_{s}^{2} ds\n$$\n\nWe apply this general result to the two martingales $M_{t}$ and $N_{t}$.\n\nFirst, consider $M_{t}=W_{t}$. This can be written in differential form as $dM_{t} = dW_{t}$, which is an Itô process with an integrand of $H_{t} = 1$. The process $H_{t}=1$ is constant and therefore predictable. Applying the formula for the predictable quadratic variation, we get:\n$$\n\\langle M \\rangle_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} 1^{2} ds = \\int_{0}^{t} ds = t\n$$\nThus, the predictable quadratic variation of a standard Brownian motion is simply time, $\\langle W \\rangle_{t} = t$.\n\nSecond, consider $N_{t}=\\int_{0}^{t}\\sigma\\,dW_{s}$. This can be written in differential form as $dN_{t} = \\sigma\\,dW_{t}$. This is an Itô process with an integrand of $H_{t} = \\sigma$. Since $\\sigma$ is a constant, the process $H_{t}=\\sigma$ is predictable. Applying the formula for the predictable quadratic variation yields:\n$$\n\\langle N \\rangle_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} \\sigma^{2} ds = \\sigma^{2} \\int_{0}^{t} ds = \\sigma^{2} t\n$$\nSo, the predictable quadratic variation of the scaled Brownian motion is $\\sigma^{2}t$.\n\nNow, we connect these results to the Dubins–Schwarz theorem. The theorem states that any continuous local martingale $X$ (with $X_{0}=0$ and $\\langle X \\rangle_{\\infty}=\\infty$) can be represented as a time-changed Brownian motion. Specifically, there exists a standard Brownian motion $B$ such that $X_{t} = B_{\\langle X \\rangle_{t}}$ for all $t \\ge 0$. The process $\\langle X \\rangle_{t}$ serves as the new \"clock\" for the underlying Brownian motion.\n\nFor $M_{t} = W_{t}$, we found $\\langle M \\rangle_{t} = t$. The Dubins–Schwarz theorem implies $M_{t} = B_{\\langle M \\rangle_{t}} = B_{t}$ for some standard Brownian motion $B$. This is trivially satisfied by letting $B_{t}=W_{t}$. The clock for $M_{t}$ is the standard clock $t$, which is expected as $M_{t}$ is itself a standard Brownian motion.\n\nFor $N_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t}\\sigma\\,dW_{s}$, we found $\\langle N \\rangle_{t} = \\sigma^{2}t$. The Dubins–Schwarz theorem asserts the existence of a standard Brownian motion $B$ such that $N_{t} = B_{\\langle N \\rangle_{t}} = B_{\\sigma^{2}t}$. This reveals that the process $N_{t}$ is a standard Brownian motion run on a clock that proceeds at a rate of $\\sigma^{2}$ relative to the calendar time $t$. If $|\\sigma|>1$, the clock runs faster; if $|\\sigma|<1$, it runs slower. If $\\sigma=0$, the clock stops, $\\langle N \\rangle_{t}=0$, and $N_t = B_0 = 0$ for all $t$.\n\nFinally, we reconcile these findings with the Itô isometry. The Itô isometry states that for a suitable predictable integrand process $H_{s}$, the second moment of the Itô integral is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\int_{0}^{t} H_{s} dW_{s}\\right)^{2}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{t} H_{s}^{2} ds\\right]\n$$\nThis connects the $L^{2}$ norm of the random variable $\\int_{0}^{t} H_{s} dW_{s}$ to the $L^{2}$ norm of the integrand process $H$.\nA fundamental property relating the martingale $X_{t}^{2} - \\langle X \\rangle_{t}$ to expected values is that if $X$ is a martingale (not just a local martingale) with $X_0=0$ and $\\mathbb{E}[\\langle X \\rangle_t] < \\infty$, then $\\mathbb{E}[X_{t}^{2}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\langle X \\rangle_t]$.\n\nFor $M_{t}=W_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} 1\\,dW_{s}$:\nUsing the Itô isometry with $H_{s}=1$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[M_{t}^{2}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\int_{0}^{t} 1\\,dW_{s}\\right)^{2}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{t} 1^{2}\\,ds\\right] = \\mathbb{E}[t] = t\n$$\nThis aligns with our result for the predictable quadratic variation, since $\\mathbb{E}[\\langle M \\rangle_{t}] = \\mathbb{E}[t] = t$. So, $\\mathbb{E}[M_{t}^{2}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\langle M \\rangle_{t}]$. This is also consistent with the known property of Brownian motion that $\\text{Var}(W_{t}) = t$, and since $\\mathbb{E}[W_t]=0$, $\\mathbb{E}[W_{t}^{2}] = t$.\n\nFor $N_{t}=\\int_{0}^{t}\\sigma\\,dW_{s}$:\nUsing the Itô isometry with $H_{s}=\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[N_{t}^{2}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\int_{0}^{t} \\sigma\\,dW_{s}\\right)^{2}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{t} \\sigma^{2}\\,ds\\right] = \\mathbb{E}[\\sigma^{2}t] = \\sigma^{2}t\n$$\nThis aligns with our result for the predictable quadratic variation, since $\\mathbb{E}[\\langle N \\rangle_{t}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\sigma^{2}t] = \\sigma^{2}t$.

This is a direct application of the Dubins-Schwarz (DDS) theorem.\n\nFirst, let us state the relevant version of the DDS theorem. Let $(M_{t})_{t \\geq 0}$ be a continuous local martingale on a filtered probability space, with $M_{0} = 0$. Let $A(t) = \\langle M \\rangle_{t}$ be its quadratic variation process. Define a family of stopping times $(\\tau_{t})_{t \\geq 0}$ by\n$$\n\\tau_{t} = \\inf\\{s \\geq 0 : A(s) > t\\}\n$$\nThis family $(\\tau_{t})_{t \\geq 0}$ constitutes a time-change, and is the right-continuous inverse of the process $(A(t))_{t \\geq 0}$. The DDS theorem asserts that the time-changed process $(B_{t})_{t \\geq 0}$, defined by $B_{t} = M_{\\tau_{t}}$, is a standard Brownian motion with respect to the time-changed filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{t}})_{t \\geq 0}$, provided that $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} A(t) = \\infty$ almost surely.\n\nNow, we apply this theorem to the specific problem. The continuous local martingale is given by the Itô integral\n$$\nM_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t}a(s)\\,dW_{s}\n$$\nwhere $(W_{t})_{t \\geq 0}$ is a standard Brownian motion and $a$ is a deterministic, measurable function. The process starts at $M_{0} = \\int_{0}^{0}a(s)\\,dW_{s} = 0$.\n\nThe next step is to compute the quadratic variation process, $\\langle M \\rangle_{t}$. For an Itô integral with a deterministic integrand, the quadratic variation is given by\n$$\n\\langle M \\rangle_{t} = \\left\\langle \\int_{0}^{\\cdot}a(s)\\,dW_{s} \\right\\rangle_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} a(s)^{2} \\, d\\langle W \\rangle_{s}\n$$\nSince $(W_{t})_{t \\geq 0}$ is a standard Brownian motion, its quadratic variation is $\\langle W \\rangle_{s} = s$. Therefore, $d\\langle W \\rangle_{s} = ds$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\langle M \\rangle_{t}$ yields\n$$\n\\langle M \\rangle_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} a(s)^{2} \\, ds\n$$\nThe problem statement defines the function $A(t) = \\int_{0}^{t}a(s)^{2}\\,ds$, which is precisely the quadratic variation of $M_{t}$. Thus, $A(t) = \\langle M \\rangle_{t}$.\n\nAccording to the DDS theorem, the time-change $(\\tau_{t})_{t \\geq 0}$ that transforms $(M_{t})_{t \\geq 0}$ into a standard Brownian motion is given by the right-continuous inverse of its quadratic variation process $(A(t))_{t \\geq 0}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{t} = \\inf\\{s \\geq 0 : A(s) > t\\}\n$$\nWe are given that the function $a$ maps $[0,\\infty)$ to $(0,\\infty)$. This implies that $a(s) > 0$ for all $s \\geq 0$. Consequently, the integrand $a(s)^{2}$ is strictly positive for all $s \\geq 0$. The function $A(t) = \\int_{0}^{t}a(s)^{2}\\,ds$ has the following properties:\n1.  $A(0) = \\int_{0}^{0}a(s)^{2}\\,ds = 0$.\n2.  $A(t)$ is continuous for $t \\geq 0$, as it is the integral of a locally integrable function.\n3.  $A(t)$ is strictly increasing for $t \\geq 0$, because its derivative with respect to $t$ is $A'(t) = a(t)^{2} > 0$.\n\nA function that is continuous and strictly increasing on an interval has a well-defined inverse function, which is also continuous and strictly increasing. Let us denote the inverse of the function $A$ by $A^{-1}$. The domain of $A^{-1}$ is the range of $A$.\n\nWe can now simplify the expression for $\\tau_{t}$. For a continuous and strictly increasing function $A$, the inequality $A(s) > t$ is equivalent to $s > A^{-1}(t)$. Thus, we can rewrite the definition of $\\tau_{t}$ as\n$$\n\\tau_{t} = \\inf\\{s \\geq 0 : s > A^{-1}(t)\\}\n$$\nThe set $\\{s \\geq 0 : s > A^{-1}(t)\\}$ is the open interval $(A^{-1}(t), \\infty)$, assuming $A^{-1}(t) \\geq 0$, which is true since $t \\geq 0$ and the range of $A^{-1}$ is $[0, \\infty)$.

The problem is thus deemed valid.\n\n### Step 2: Solution\n\nWe now proceed with the solution by addressing each part of the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we establish that the process $(M_{t})_{t \\ge 0}$ is a continuous local martingale. The process is defined by the Itô integral:\n$$\nM_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} \\exp(-s)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{s}\n$$\nThis is a stochastic integral of the form $M_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} H_{s}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{s}$, where the integrand is $H_{s} = \\exp(-s)$. For the Itô integral to be a continuous local martingale, the integrand process $(H_{s})_{s \\ge 0}$ must be adapted to the filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_{s})_{s \\ge 0}$ and must satisfy the condition $\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\int_{0}^{t} H_{s}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}s < \\infty\\right) = 1$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\nThe integrand $H_{s} = \\exp(-s)$ is a deterministic function of time $s$. A deterministic function is measurable with respect to the trivial $\\sigma$-algebra, which is a sub-$\\sigma$-algebra of $\\mathcal{F}_{0}$. Since the filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_{t})_{t \\ge 0}$ is increasing, $H_{s}$ is adapted to $(\\mathcal{F}_{s})_{s \\ge 0}$ for all $s \\ge 0$.\n\nNext, we check the integrability condition. We compute the integral of $H_{s}^{2}$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} H_{s}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}s = \\int_{0}^{t} (\\exp(-s))^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}s = \\int_{0}^{t} \\exp(-2s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s\n$$\nThis integral evaluates to:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} \\exp(-2s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-2s) \\right]_{0}^{t} = -\\frac{1}{2}(\\exp(-2t) - \\exp(-2 \\cdot 0)) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\exp(-2t))\n$$\nFor any finite $t \\ge 0$, the value $\\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\exp(-2t))$ is a finite deterministic number. Thus, the condition $\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\int_{0}^{t} H_{s}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}s < \\infty\\right) = 1$ is satisfied. By the fundamental properties of the Itô integral, it follows that $(M_{t})_{t \\ge 0}$ is a continuous local martingale. Furthermore, since $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{t} H_{s}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}s\\right] = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\exp(-2t)) < \\infty$, $(M_t)_{t\\ge 0}$ is in fact a true $L^{2}$-martingale, which is a stronger condition.\n\nSecond, we compute the quadratic variation process, $(\\langle M \\rangle_{t})_{t \\ge 0}$. For a continuous local martingale given by an Itô integral $M_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} H_{s}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{s}$, the quadratic variation is defined as:\n$$\n\\langle M \\rangle_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} H_{s}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}s\n$$\nUsing our previously calculated integral, we have:\n$$\n\\langle M \\rangle_{t} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\exp(-2t))\n$$\nTo determine if this process is bounded as $t \\to \\infty$, we compute its limit:\n$$\n\\langle M \\rangle_{\\infty} := \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\langle M \\rangle_{t} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\exp(-2t))\n$$\nSince $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\exp(-2t) = 0$, the limit is:\n$$\n\\langle M \\rangle_{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - 0) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe quadratic variation process $(\\langle M \\rangle_{t})_{t \\ge 0}$ is indeed bounded. For all $t \\ge 0$, we have $0 \\le \\langle M \\rangle_{t} < \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThird, we apply the Dubins–Schwarz (DDS) time-change theorem. The theorem states that for any continuous local martingale $(M_{t})_{t \\ge 0}$ starting at $M_{0}=0$, there exists a standard Brownian motion $(B_{u})_{u \\ge 0}$ such that $M_{t} = B_{\\langle M \\rangle_{t}}$. The new time parameter $u$ for the process $B$ is given by the quadratic variation of $M$.\nThe relation $M_{t} = B_{\\langle M \\rangle_{t}}$ implies that the Brownian motion $B_{u}$ is sampled at times $u = \\langle M \\rangle_{t}$. The set of all such times, as $t$ spans $[0, \\infty)$, is the range of the process $(\\langle M \\rangle_{t})_{t \\ge 0}$.\n\nWe have found that $\\langle M \\rangle_{0} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\exp(0)) = 0$ and $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\langle M \\rangle_{t} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since $\\langle M \\rangle_{t}$ is a continuous and strictly increasing function of $t$, its range for $t \\in [0, \\infty)$ is the interval $[0, \\frac{1}{2})$.\nTherefore, the construction of the Brownian motion $(B_{u})$ via the DDS theorem defines it for time $u$ in this interval, i.e., for $u \\in [0, \\frac{1}{2})$. The time-changed process $B_{u} = M_{\\tau_u}$ (where $\\tau_u = \\inf\\{s \\ge 0: \\langle M \\rangle_s > u\\}$) is a standard Brownian motion on the time interval $[0, \\langle M \\rangle_\\infty)$.\n\nThe question asks for the finite deterministic time up to which the associated Brownian motion is defined. This corresponds to the supremum of the time interval over which the DDS construction naturally defines $B_u$. This supremum is $\\langle M \\rangle_{\\infty}$.\nThus, the finite deterministic time is given by the total accumulated quadratic variation:\n$$\n\\langle M \\rangle_{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe associated Brownian motion $(B_u)$ is a standard Brownian motion on the interval $[0, \\frac{1}{2})$. For times $u \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$, it can be thought of as a Brownian motion stopped at time $\\frac{1}{2}$. The problem asks to identify that stopping time.\n\nThe finite deterministic time is $\\frac{1}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "3050789"}]}
