It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem within the field of stochastic differential equations and its connection to partial differential equations. All definitions and conditions are standard and self-consistent.\n\nThe problem is addressed in two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Scaling property and its implication for mean exit time.\n\nThe problem states the scaling property of a standard $d$-dimensional Brownian motion $\\{B_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ as: for any constant $c>0$, the process $\\{B_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ has the same distribution as the process $\\{\\sqrt{c}\\,B_{t/c}\\}_{t \\ge 0}$. Let us choose $c = 1/\\lambda^2$ for some $\\lambda>0$. The scaling property then implies that $\\{B_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ has the same distribution as $\\{\\frac{1}{\\lambda}B_{\\lambda^2 t}\\}_{t \\ge 0}$. This is the characteristic parabolic scaling where space is scaled by a factor of $\\lambda$ and time is scaled by a factor of $\\lambda^2$.\n\nThe infinitesimal generator of the Brownian motion is given as $\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta$, where $\\Delta$ is the Laplacian operator. The generator connects the stochastic process to analysis. Specifically, for a suitable function $f$, Dynkin's formula states that $\\mathbb{E}_y[f(X_t)] - f(y) = \\mathbb{E}_y\\left[\\int_0^t \\mathcal{L}f(X_s) ds\\right]$ for a process $X_t$ starting at $y$. The generator has units of $(\\text{time})^{-1}$. Since $\\Delta_x = \\sum_{i=1}^d \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_i^2}$, it has units of $(\\text{length})^{-2}$. The structure of the generator $\\mathcal{L} \\propto \\Delta$ thus intrinsically links a unit of time to a unit of length squared. This suggests that any quantity with units of time, derived from the process, should scale quadratically with the characteristic length scale of the problem.\n\nLet us formalize this for the mean exit time. Let $u(y) = \\mathbb{E}_y[\\tau_{B(x,r)}]$ be the mean exit time from the ball $B(x,r) = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^d : |z-x|<r\\}$ for a process $X_t = y + B_t$ starting at $y \\in B(x,r)$.\nThe exit condition is $|X_t-x| \\ge r$, which can be written as $|(y-x) + B_t| \\ge r$.\nLet us rescale space by $r$. Dividing by $r$ gives $|\\frac{y-x}{r} + \\frac{1}{r}B_t| \\ge 1$.\nNow, let's perform the corresponding parabolic time scaling. Define a new time variable $s=t/r^2$, so $t=r^2s$.\nAccording to the Brownian scaling property with $c=1/r^2$, the process $W_s = \\frac{1}{r} B_{r^2 s}$ is also a standard $d$-dimensional Brownian motion.\nIn terms of the new process $W_s$, the exit condition becomes $|\\frac{y-x}{r} + W_s| \\ge 1$.\nThe original exit time is $\\tau_{B(x,r)} = \\inf\\{ t > 0 : |(y-x)+B_t| \\ge r\\}$. The exit time in the rescaled system is $\\tilde{\\tau} = \\inf\\{ s > 0 : |\\frac{y-x}{r}+W_s| \\ge 1\\}$.\nFrom the relation $t=r^2s$, we have $\\tau_{B(x,r)} = r^2 \\tilde{\\tau}$.\nThe rescaled problem describes the exit of a standard Brownian motion from the unit ball $B(0,1)$, starting from the point $z = \\frac{y-x}{r}$.\nLet $v(z) = \\mathbb{E}_z[\\tau_{B(0,1)}]$ be the mean exit time from the unit ball for a process starting at $z$. Then $\\mathbb{E}[\\tilde{\\tau}] = v(\\frac{y-x}{r})$.\nTaking the expectation of the relation $\\tau_{B(x,r)} = r^2\\tilde{\\tau}$, we get:\n$$ u(y) = \\mathbb{E}_y[\\tau_{B(x,r)}] = r^2 \\mathbb{E}[\\tilde{\\tau}] = r^2 v\\left(\\frac{y-x}{r}\\right) $$\nDue to the rotational symmetry of Brownian motion and the ball, the function $v(z)$ must depend only on the distance $|z|$ from the center. Thus, $v(z) = \\phi(|z|)$ for some function $\\phi$.\nThe mean exit time must therefore have the form:\n$$ u(y) = r^2 \\phi\\left(\\frac{|y-x|}{r}\\right) $$\nThis result demonstrates that the mean exit time scales as the square of the radius $r$ of the ball.\n\nPart 2: Derivation and solution of the boundary value problem.\n\nThe problem provides the probabilistic representation for the solution to an elliptic PDE: for a domain $D$ and function $f$, the function $u(y) := \\mathbb{E}_y\\!\\left[\\int_0^{\\tau_D} f(B_s)\\,ds\\right]$ solves the boundary value problem (BVP):\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta u(y) = -f(y) \\quad \\text{for } y \\in D $$\n$$ u(y) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } y \\in \\partial D $$\nWe are interested in the mean exit time $u(y) = \\mathbb{E}_y[\\tau_{B(x,r)}]$. The exit time can be written as an integral:\n$$ \\tau_{B(x,r)} = \\int_0^{\\tau_{B(x,r)}} 1 \\, ds $$\nComparing this to the given representation, we can identify our domain as $D=B(x,r)$ and the function $f$ as the constant function $f(y)=1$. The process is $y+B_s$, but since the generator applies to the state variable, and $f$ is constant, this distinction is immaterial here.\nTherefore, the mean exit time $u(y)$ must satisfy the Poisson equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta u(y) = -1, \\quad y \\in B(x,r) $$\nwith the boundary condition that the process stops upon hitting the boundary $\\partial B(x,r)$, so the remaining expected time is zero:\n$$ u(y) = 0, \\quad y \\in \\partial B(x,r) $$\nThis constitutes the BVP:\n$$ \\Delta u = -2 \\quad \\text{in } B(x,r); \\quad u=0 \\quad \\text{on } \\partial B(x,r) $$\nDue to the spherical symmetry of the domain, the boundary condition, and the Laplacian operator, the solution $u(y)$ must be radially symmetric about the center $x$. We can thus write $u(y) = \\phi(\\rho)$ where $\\rho = |y-x|$ is the radial distance from the center.\nIn $d$-dimensional spherical coordinates, the Laplacian of a radially symmetric function $\\phi(\\rho)$ is given by:\n$$ \\Delta \\phi(\\rho) = \\frac{d^2\\phi}{d\\rho^2} + \\frac{d-1}{\\rho} \\frac{d\\phi}{d\\rho} $$\nThe PDE transforms into an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $\\phi(\\rho)$ on the interval $[0,r)$:\n$$ \\phi''(\\rho) + \\frac{d-1}{\\rho} \\phi'(\\rho) = -2 $$\nThe boundary condition becomes $\\phi(r)=0$. Let $v(\\rho) = \\phi'(\\rho)$. The ODE is a first-order linear equation for $v$:\n$$ v' + \\frac{d-1}{\\rho} v = -2 $$\nWe solve this using an integrating factor $I(\\rho) = \\exp\\left(\\int \\frac{d-1}{\\rho} d\\rho\\right) = \\exp((d-1)\\ln\\rho) = \\rho^{d-1}$.\nMultiplying the ODE by $I(\\rho)$ gives:\n$$ \\rho^{d-1}v' + (d-1)\\rho^{d-2}v = -2\\rho^{d-1} $$\nThe left side is the derivative of a product:\n$$ \\frac{d}{d\\rho}(\\rho^{d-1}v) = -2\\rho^{d-1} $$\nIntegrating with respect to $\\rho$:\n$$ \\rho^{d-1}v(\\rho) = \\int -2\\rho^{d-1} d\\rho = -2\\frac{\\rho^d}{d} + C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is an integration constant. Solving for $v(\\rho) = \\phi'(\\rho)$:\n$$ \\phi'(\\rho) = -\\frac{2\\rho}{d} + C_1\\rho^{1-d} $$\nThe solution $u(y)$ must be well-behaved (specifically, differentiable) at the center of the ball, $y=x$, which corresponds to $\\rho=0$. If $d>1$, the term $\\rho^{1-d}$ diverges as $\\rho \\to 0$ unless $C_1=0$. If $d=1$, the term is $C_1\\rho^0=C_1$, but symmetry requires the gradient to be zero at the center of the domain, so $\\phi'(0)=0$, which implies $C_1=0$. Thus, for all $d \\ge 1$, we must set $C_1=0$ for a physically and mathematically regular solution.\nThis simplifies the derivative to:\n$$ \\phi'(\\rho) = -\\frac{2\\rho}{d} $$\nIntegrating again with respect to $\\rho$ gives $\\phi(\\rho)$:\n$$ \\phi(\\rho) = \\int -\\frac{2\\rho}{d} d\\rho = -\\frac{\\rho^2}{d} + C_2 $$\nwhere $C_2$ is the second integration constant. We determine $C_2$ using the boundary condition $\\phi(r)=0$:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{r^2}{d} + C_2 \\implies C_2 = \\frac{r^2}{d} $$\nSubstituting $C_2$ back, we obtain the expression for $\\phi(\\rho)$:\n$$ \\phi(\\rho) = \\frac{r^2}{d} - \\frac{\\rho^2}{d} = \\frac{r^2 - \\rho^2}{d} $$\nSince $u(y) = \\phi(\\rho)$ and $\\rho=|y-x|$, the mean exit time is:\n$$ u(y) = \\mathbb{E}_y[\\tau_{B(x,r)}] = \\frac{r^2 - |y-x|^2}{d} $$\nThe problem asks for the expression in terms of $d$, $r$, and $\\rho := |y-x|$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{r^2 - \\rho^2}{d}} $$", "id": "3070396"}, {"introduction": "Next, we shift our focus from exit times to boundary values, tackling the classic Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation.
