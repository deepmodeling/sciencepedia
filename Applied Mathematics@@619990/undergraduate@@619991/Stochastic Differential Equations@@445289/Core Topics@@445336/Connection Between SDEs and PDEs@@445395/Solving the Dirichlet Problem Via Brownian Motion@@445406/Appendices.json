Validation against Criteria**\nThe problem is mathematically and scientifically sound. It is a standard application of stochastic calculus to solve a partial differential equation, specifically the Dirichlet problem for the one-dimensional Laplace equation. The connection between Brownian motion and the Laplacian, via Dynkin's formula and the probabilistic representation of solutions, is a cornerstone of the theory of stochastic processes. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary information provided and no contradictions. The terminology is precise and objective. There are no flaws according to the checklist.\n\n**1.3. Verdict**\nThe problem is valid.\n\n**2. Solution**\n\nThe problem asks for the explicit form of the function $u(x) = \\mathbb{E}_{x}[f(B_{\\tau})]$ for a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion $\\{B_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ starting at $x \\in (0,a)$, where $\\tau$ is the first exit time from the interval $D=(0,a)$ and $f(y)=y^2$. The subscript $x$ in the expectation $\\mathbb{E}_x[\\cdot]$ denotes conditioning on the starting event $B_0=x$. This function $u(x)$ is the solution to the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation on the interval $D$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta u(x) = 0, & x \\in (0,a) \\\\\nu(x) = f(x), & x \\in \\partial D = \\{0,a\\}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nIn one dimension, this is $u''(x)=0$ with boundary conditions $u(0)=f(0)=0^2=0$ and $u(a)=f(a)=a^2$. We will derive the solution $u(x)$ using the prescribed probabilistic method.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Martingales**\nA process $\\{M_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ is a martingale with respect to the filtration generated by $\\{B_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ if $\\mathbb{E}[|M_t|] < \\infty$ for all $t$ and $\\mathbb{E}[M_t | \\mathcal{F}_s] = M_s$ for all $s<t$.\n- A standard Brownian motion $\\{B_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ is itself a martingale. This can be seen as a specific case from Itô's formula. For a twice-differentiable function $g(x)$, the process $g(B_t)$ is a local martingale if its drift term is zero. From Itô's formula, $d(g(B_t)) = g'(B_t) dB_t + \\frac{1}{2}g''(B_t) dt$. For the drift to be zero, we need $g''(x)=0$, which implies $g(x)=c_1 x + c_2$ for constants $c_1, c_2$. Choosing $c_1=1$ and $c_2=0$ shows that $M_t^{(1)} = B_t$ is a (local) martingale. Since $\\mathbb{E}[|B_t|] < \\infty$, it is a true martingale.\n- Another important martingale is $M_t^{(2)} = B_t^2 - t$. Applying Itô's formula to $g(t,x)=x^2-t$ gives $d(B_t^2-t) = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial t}dt + \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}dB_t + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial x^2}dt = -1 dt + 2B_t dB_t + \\frac{1}{2}(2)dt = 2B_t dB_t$. Since the drift term is zero, $\\{B_t^2-t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ is a local martingale, and it can be shown to be a true martingale.\n\nWe will use the first martingale, $M_t = B_t$, to solve the problem as instructed.\n\n**Step 2: Justify and Apply the Optional Stopping Theorem (OST)**\nThe Optional Stopping Theorem states that for a martingale $\\{M_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ and a stopping time $\\tau$, under certain conditions, $\\mathbb{E}[M_\\tau] = \\mathbb{E}[M_0]$. We apply this theorem to the martingale $M_t = B_t$ and the first exit time $\\tau$ from $(0,a)$.\n\nTo apply the OST, we need to verify its conditions. One widely used set of sufficient conditions is:\n1. $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau < \\infty) = 1$.\n2. The stopped process $\\{M_{t \\wedge \\tau}\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ is uniformly integrable.\n\nFor a one-dimensional Brownian motion starting inside a finite interval, it is a standard result that the process will exit the interval in finite time with probability $1$. Thus, $\\mathbb{P}_x(\\tau < \\infty) = 1$.\n\nA sufficient condition for uniform integrability is that the stopped process is bounded. Let us examine the stopped process $M_{t \\wedge \\tau} = B_{t \\wedge \\tau}$. By definition of the stopping time $\\tau$, for any time $s \\leq \\tau$, the process $B_s$ is within the interval $[0,a]$. Since $t \\wedge \\tau \\leq \\tau$, the value of the process at this time, $B_{t \\wedge \\tau}$, must lie in the closed interval $[0,a]$. Therefore, $|B_{t \\wedge \\tau}| \\leq a$ for all $t \\geq 0$. The stopped process is bounded, which implies it is uniformly integrable.\n\nBoth conditions are met, so we can apply the OST to the martingale $M_t = B_t$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_x[B_\\tau] = \\mathbb{E}_x[B_0]\n$$\nGiven the initial condition $B_0=x$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_x[B_\\tau] = x\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Compute $\\mathbb{P}_x(B_\\tau = a)$**\nBy the definition of $\\tau$, the process stops as soon as it leaves the open interval $(0,a)$. Since Brownian paths are continuous, at the moment of exit, $B_\\tau$ must be on the boundary $\\partial D = \\{0,a\\}$. So, the random variable $B_\\tau$ can only take two values: $0$ and $a$.\n\nLet $p_a(x) = \\mathbb{P}_x(B_\\tau = a)$. Then, the probability of exiting at the other end is $\\mathbb{P}_x(B_\\tau = 0) = 1 - p_a(x)$. We can express the expectation of $B_\\tau$ using these probabilities:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_x[B_\\tau] = a \\cdot \\mathbb{P}_x(B_\\tau = a) + 0 \\cdot \\mathbb{P}_x(B_\\tau = 0) = a \\cdot p_a(x)\n$$\nEquating this with the result from the OST in Step 2:\n$$\na \\cdot p_a(x) = x\n$$\nSolving for $p_a(x)$, we find the probability of the Brownian motion exiting at $a$:\n$$\np_a(x) = \\mathbb{P}_x(B_\\tau = a) = \\frac{x}{a}\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Compute $u(x) = \\mathbb{E}_x[f(B_\\tau)]$**\nThe function to be determined is $u(x) = \\mathbb{E}_x[f(B_\\tau)]$, where the boundary function is $f(y) = y^2$. The random variable $f(B_\\tau)$ takes the value $f(a)=a^2$ when $B_\\tau=a$, and the value $f(0)=0^2=0$ when $B_\\tau=0$.\n\nWe compute the expectation by summing over the possible outcomes:\n$$\nu(x) = \\mathbb{E}_x[f(B_\\tau)] = f(a) \\cdot \\mathbb{P}_x(B_\\tau = a) + f(0) \\cdot \\mathbb{P}_x(B_\\tau = 0)\n$$\nSubstituting the known values and the probability calculated in Step 3:\n$$\nu(x) = a^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right) + 0 \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{a}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nu(x) = a x\n$$\nThis is the explicit form for $u(x)$. We can verify that this solution satisfies the corresponding differential equation $u''(x)=0$ and boundary conditions: $u(0)=a \\cdot 0 = 0=f(0)$ and $u(a)=a \\cdot a = a^2=f(a)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ax}$$", "id": "3074772"}, {"introduction": "Beyond finding where a process ends up, we can also ask *when* it gets there.

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all provided information is consistent and sufficient for a unique solution.\n\nWe will proceed in three parts as requested by the problem statement. First, we will derive the boundary value problem (BVP) satisfied by the function $u(x)$. Second, we will use this result to justify the finiteness of $u(x)$. Third, we will solve this BVP for the specific case of a $d$-dimensional ball.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Boundary Value Problem**\n\nLet $u(x) = \\mathbb{E}_{x}[\\tau_{D}]$, where $\\tau_{D} = \\inf\\{t \\geq 0 : B_{t} \\notin D\\}$ is the first exit time of a standard $d$-dimensional Brownian motion $\\{B_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ from an open, bounded domain $D \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$. The expectation $\\mathbb{E}_{x}$ is conditioned on the process starting at $x \\in D$, i.e., $B_0=x$. The infinitesimal generator of $B_t$ is given as $\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta$.\n\nWe will demonstrate that $u(x)$ satisfies the following Poisson problem with a Dirichlet boundary condition:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta u(x) = -1 & \\text{for } x \\in D \\\\\nu(x) = 0 & \\text{for } x \\in \\partial D\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe boundary condition follows directly from the definition of $u(x)$. If the starting point $x$ is on the boundary $\\partial D$, the process is already outside the open domain $D$, so the first exit time is $\\tau_D = 0$. Thus, $u(x) = \\mathbb{E}_x[0] = 0$ for $x \\in \\partial D$.\n\nTo derive the partial differential equation, let us assume there exists a unique solution $v(x) \\in C^2(D) \\cap C(\\bar{D})$ to the boundary value problem:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta v(x) = -1 & \\text{for } x \\in D \\\\\nv(x) = 0 & \\text{for } x \\in \\partial D\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nWe apply Itô's formula to the process $v(B_t)$. For a time $t \\geq 0$, this yields:\n$$v(B_t) - v(B_0) = \\int_0^t \\nabla v(B_s) \\cdot dB_s + \\int_0^t \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta v(B_s) ds$$\nwhere $\\nabla v$ is the gradient of $v$ and $\\Delta v$ is its Laplacian.\n\nLet us stop the process at the time $t \\wedge \\tau_D = \\min(t, \\tau_D)$. For any $s < \\tau_D$, the process $B_s$ is inside the domain $D$, so $\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta v(B_s) = -1$. Substituting this into the stopped version of Itô's formula gives:\n$$v(B_{t \\wedge \\tau_D}) - v(B_0) = \\int_0^{t \\wedge \\tau_D} \\nabla v(B_s) \\cdot dB_s + \\int_0^{t \\wedge \\tau_D} (-1) ds$$\nSince $B_0=x$, we can write:\n$$v(B_{t \\wedge \\tau_D}) - v(x) = \\int_0^{t \\wedge \\tau_D} \\nabla v(B_s) \\cdot dB_s - (t \\wedge \\tau_D)$$\nWe now take the expectation $\\mathbb{E}_x$ of both sides. The stochastic integral term $\\int_0^{t \\wedge \\tau_D} \\nabla v(B_s) \\cdot dB_s$ is a local martingale. Since $D$ is bounded and $v \\in C^2(D)$, its gradient $\\nabla v$ is bounded on any compact subset of $D$. Under these conditions, the optional stopping theorem can be applied, and the expectation of the stochastic integral is zero.\n$$\\mathbb{E}_x \\left[ \\int_0^{t \\wedge \\tau_D} \\nabla v(B_s) \\cdot dB_s \\right] = 0$$\nThus, the equation for the expectations becomes:\n$$\\mathbb{E}_x[v(B_{t \\wedge \\tau_D})] - v(x) = -\\mathbb{E}_x[t \\wedge \\tau_D]$$\nRearranging for $v(x)$, we have:\n$$v(x) = \\mathbb{E}_x[v(B_{t \\wedge \\tau_D})] + \\mathbb{E}_x[t \\wedge \\tau_D]$$\nWe now take the limit as $t \\to \\infty$.\nFor a bounded domain $D$, the Brownian motion exits with probability one, so $\\tau_D < \\infty$ almost surely. As $t \\to \\infty$, the random variable $t \\wedge \\tau_D$ converges to $\\tau_D$. By the Monotone Convergence Theorem, we have:\n$$\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\mathbb{E}_x[t \\wedge \\tau_D] = \\mathbb{E}_x[\\tau_D]$$\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, the process position $B_{t \\wedge \\tau_D}$ converges to $B_{\\tau_D}$, which lies on the boundary $\\partial D$. Since $v \\in C(\\bar{D})$ and $v(y)=0$ for all $y \\in \\partial D$, we have $v(B_{\\tau_D}) = 0$. The function $v$ is continuous on the compact set $\\bar{D}$, so it is bounded. We can apply the Dominated Convergence Theorem:\n$$\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\mathbb{E}_x[v(B_{t \\wedge \\tau_D})] = \\mathbb{E}_x[\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} v(B_{t \\wedge \\tau_D})] = \\mathbb{E}_x[v(B_{\\tau_D})] = \\mathbb{E}_x[0] = 0$$\nTaking the limit $t \\to \\infty$ in the equation for $v(x)$, we obtain:\n$$v(x) = 0 + \\mathbb{E}_x[\\tau_D] = u(x)$$\nThis establishes that $u(x)$ is the solution to the BVP. The problem is equivalent to solving $\\Delta u(x) = -2$ in $D$ with boundary condition $u(x)=0$ on $\\partial D$.\n\n**Part 2: Finiteness of $u(x)$**\n\nThe boundary value problem derived above is a standard Poisson equation on a bounded domain $D$ with a $C^2$ boundary $\\partial D$ and a Dirichlet boundary condition. From the theory of elliptic partial differential equations, it is known that for a smooth-enough domain and continuous data, such a problem admits a unique solution $u(x)$ that belongs to the class $C^2(D) \\cap C(\\bar{D})$.\nA function that is continuous on a compact set (here, the closure $\\bar{D}$) must be bounded. Therefore, $u(x)$ must be finite for all $x \\in \\bar{D}$.\n\n**Part 3: Solution for the Ball $D = B(0,R)$**\n\nWe now solve the specific problem where the domain is a $d$-dimensional ball of radius $R$ centered at the origin: $D = B(0,R) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d : |x| < R\\}$. The BVP is:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\Delta u(x) = -2 & \\text{for } |x| < R \\\\\nu(x) = 0 & \\text{for } |x| = R\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nGiven the spherical symmetry of the domain and the boundary condition, the solution $u(x)$ must depend only on the radial distance $r = |x|$. We thus seek a solution of the form $u(x) = f(r)$.\nThe Laplacian operator in $d$-dimensional spherical coordinates acting on a radial function $f(r)$ is:\n$$\\Delta u = f''(r) + \\frac{d-1}{r}f'(r)$$\nThe PDE becomes an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $f(r)$:\n$$f''(r) + \\frac{d-1}{r}f'(r) = -2, \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\leq r < R$$\nThe boundary condition is $f(R) = 0$. Furthermore, for the solution $u(x)$ to be smooth (specifically $C^2$) at the origin, its gradient must be zero at $x=0$, which implies $f'(0) = 0$. This prevents the term $\\frac{d-1}{r}f'(r)$ from being singular at $r=0$ for $d>1$.\n\nLet $g(r) = f'(r)$. The ODE becomes a first-order linear equation for $g(r)$:\n$$g'(r) + \\frac{d-1}{r}g(r) = -2$$\nThe integrating factor is $I(r) = \\exp\\left(\\int \\frac{d-1}{r} dr\\right) = \\exp((d-1)\\ln r) = r^{d-1}$.\nMultiplying the ODE by the integrating factor gives:\n$$r^{d-1}g'(r) + (d-1)r^{d-2}g(r) = -2r^{d-1}$$\nThe left-hand side is the derivative of a product:\n$$\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^{d-1}g(r)\\right) = -2r^{d-1}$$\nIntegrating with respect to $r$:\n$$r^{d-1}g(r) = \\int -2r^{d-1} dr = -2\\frac{r^d}{d} + C_1$$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration. Solving for $g(r)$:\n$$g(r) = f'(r) = -\\frac{2r}{d} + C_1r^{1-d}$$\nApplying the regularity condition $f'(0)=0$. For $d \\ge 2$, the term $C_1r^{1-d}$ is singular as $r \\to 0$ unless $C_1=0$. For $d=1$, $f'(r) = -2r+C_1$, and $f'(0)=C_1=0$. In all cases, we must have $C_1=0$.\nThis simplifies the derivative to:\n$$f'(r) = -\\frac{2r}{d}$$\nIntegrating $f'(r)$ to find $f(r)$:\n$$f(r) = \\int -\\frac{2r}{d} dr = -\\frac{r^2}{d} + C_2$$\nwhere $C_2$ is the second integration constant. We determine $C_2$ using the boundary condition $f(R)=0$:\n$$0 = f(R) = -\\frac{R^2}{d} + C_2 \\implies C_2 = \\frac{R^2}{d}$$\nSubstituting $C_2$ back, we obtain the expression for $f(r)$:\n$$f(r) = \\frac{R^2}{d} - \\frac{r^2}{d} = \\frac{R^2 - r^2}{d}$$\nSince $u(x) = f(|x|)$, the solution in terms of $x$ is:\n$$u(x) = \\frac{R^2 - |x|^2}{d}$$\nThis expression represents the mean first exit time from a $d$-dimensional ball of radius $R$ for a Brownian motion starting at position $x$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{R^2 - |x|^2}{d}}$$", "id": "3074767"}, {"introduction": "We now move to the classic two-dimensional setting of the unit disk, a cornerstone of potential theory.

Let us assume our solution $u$ is such a function.\n\nAs $M_t = u(B_{t \\wedge \\tau})$ is a martingale, the Optional Stopping Theorem (OST) can be applied. For any stopping time $T$, under suitable conditions, $\\mathbb{E}^x[M_T] = \\mathbb{E}^x[M_0]$. The initial value is $M_0 = u(B_0) = u(x)$.\nLet us consider the sequence of constant times $T_n = n$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. These are trivial stopping times. By the definition of a martingale, for each $n$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}^x[M_n] = \\mathbb{E}^x[u(B_{n \\wedge \\tau})] = u(x)\n$$\nWe wish to evaluate this in the limit as $n \\to \\infty$. For a two-dimensional Brownian motion starting inside a bounded domain $D$, the first exit time $\\tau$ is finite almost surely, i.e., $\\mathbb{P}^x(\\tau < \\infty) = 1$.\nTherefore, as $n \\to \\infty$, the random variable $n \\wedge \\tau$ converges to $\\tau$ almost surely.\nSince the paths of Brownian motion are continuous, $B_{n \\wedge \\tau} \\to B_{\\tau}$ almost surely.\nThe solution $u$ is continuous on the closed disk $\\overline{D}$, so we also have the almost sure convergence of the random variables:\n$$\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} u(B_{n \\wedge \\tau}) = u(B_{\\tau})\n$$\nTo interchange the limit and the expectation, we can invoke the Dominated Convergence Theorem. The solution $u$ to the Dirichlet problem with bounded boundary data $f$ is bounded on $\\overline{D}$. Let $|u(z)| \\leq K$ for all $z \\in \\overline{D}$ and some constant $K < \\infty$. Then $|u(B_{n \\wedge \\tau})| \\leq K$ for all $n$. Since the constant $K$ is an integrable random variable, the conditions for the Dominated Convergence Theorem are satisfied.\n$$\nu(x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\mathbb{E}^x[u(B_{n \\wedge \\tau})] = \\mathbb{E}^x\\left[\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} u(B_{n \\wedge \\tau})\\right] = \\mathbb{E}^x[u(B_{\\tau})]\n$$\nBy definition of the first exit time $\\tau$, the position of the particle at this time, $B_{\\tau}$, lies on the boundary $\\partial D$. The solution $u$ satisfies the boundary condition $u(z) = f(z)$ for $z \\in \\partial D$. Therefore, $u(B_{\\tau}) = f(B_{\\tau})$.\nSubstituting this into our result gives the probabilistic representation of the solution:\n$$\nu(x) = \\mathbb{E}^{x}\\!\\big[f(B_{\\tau})\\big]\n$$\nNow, we use the specific form of the boundary function $f$. It is defined as $f(\\zeta) = c_{1}$ for $\\zeta \\in A$ and $f(\\zeta) = c_{2}$ for $\\zeta \\in A^{c}$. We can write $f(\\zeta) = c_1 \\mathbf{1}_A(\\zeta) + c_2 \\mathbf{1}_{A^c}(\\zeta)$, where $\\mathbf{1}$ denotes the indicator function. The expectation becomes:\n$$\nu(x) = \\mathbb{E}^{x}\\!\\big[c_1 \\mathbf{1}_A(B_{\\tau}) + c_2 \\mathbf{1}_{A^c}(B_{\\tau})\\big]\n$$\nBy linearity of expectation:\n$$\nu(x) = c_1 \\mathbb{E}^{x}[\\mathbf{1}_A(B_{\\tau})] + c_2 \\mathbb{E}^{x}[\\mathbf{1}_{A^c}(B_{\\tau})]\n$$\nThe expectation of an indicator function is the probability of the event it indicates. Thus:\n$$\nu(x) = c_{1}\\,\\mathbb{P}^{x}(B_{\\tau} \\in A) + c_{2}\\,\\mathbb{P}^{x}(B_{\\tau} \\in A^{c})\n$$\nSince $B_{\\tau} \\in \\partial D$ and $A \\cup A^{c} = \\partial D$ with $A \\cap A^c = \\emptyset$, we have $\\mathbb{P}^{x}(B_{\\tau} \\in A) + \\mathbb{P}^{x}(B_{\\tau} \\in A^{c}) = 1$. It follows that $\\mathbb{P}^{x}(B_{\\tau} \\in A^{c}) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}^{x}(B_{\\tau} \\in A)$. Substituting this into the expression for $u(x)$ yields:\n$$\nu(x) = c_1\\,\\mathbb{P}^{x}(B_{\\tau} \\in A) + c_2(1 - \\mathbb{P}^{x}(B_{\\tau} \\in A)) = c_2 + (c_1 - c_2)\\,\\mathbb{P}^{x}(B_{\\tau} \\in A)\n$$\nThis completes the justification required in part (a).\n\n**Part b)**\n\nWe are asked to compute $u(x)$ for the specific case where $c_1=1$, $c_2=0$, $x=r e^{\\mathrm{i}0}$ (so $x$ is the point $(r,0)$ for $r \\in (0,1)$), with $r=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\alpha=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nWith $c_1=1$ and $c_2=0$, the formula from part (a) simplifies to:\n$$\nu(x) = 0 + (1-0)\\mathbb{P}^x(B_{\\tau} \\in A) = \\mathbb{P}^x(B_{\\tau} \\in A)\n$$\nThis function $u(x)$ is the harmonic measure of the arc $A$ at the point $x$. It is the solution to the Dirichlet problem with boundary data $f(\\zeta) = \\mathbf{1}_A(\\zeta)$. This solution can be calculated directly using the Poisson integral formula for the unit disk. For a point $x = r e^{i\\phi}$ and boundary data $f(e^{i\\theta})$, the solution is:\n$$\nu(r e^{i\\phi}) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} f(e^{i\\theta}) \\frac{1-r^2}{1-2r\\cos(\\theta-\\phi)+r^2} \\, d\\theta\n$$\nIn our case, $x$ is on the real axis, so $\\phi=0$. The boundary data is $f(e^{i\\theta}) = 1$ for $\\theta \\in [-\\alpha, \\alpha]$ and $0$ otherwise. The integral becomes:\n$$\nu(r) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\alpha}^{\\alpha} \\frac{1-r^2}{1-2r\\cos(\\theta)+r^2} \\, d\\theta\n$$\nThe integrand is an even function of $\\theta$. We can write:\n$$\nu(r) = \\frac{2}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\alpha} \\frac{1-r^2}{1-2r\\cos(\\theta)+r^2} \\, d\\theta = \\frac{1-r^2}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\alpha} \\frac{1}{1-2r\\cos(\\theta)+r^2} \\, d\\theta\n$$\nThis integral can be computed using the tangent half-angle substitution $t=\\tan(\\theta/2)$, which gives $d\\theta = \\frac{2}{1+t^2}dt$ and $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}$. The indefinite integral is a standard result:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{d\\theta}{1-2r\\cos(\\theta)+r^2} = \\frac{2}{1-r^2} \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1+r}{1-r}\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\right) + C\n$$\nEvaluating the definite integral:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\alpha \\frac{d\\theta}{1-2r\\cos(\\theta)+r^2} = \\left[ \\frac{2}{1-r^2} \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1+r}{1-r}\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\right) \\right]_0^\\alpha\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{2}{1-r^2} \\left[ \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1+r}{1-r}\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\right) - \\arctan(0) \\right] = \\frac{2}{1-r^2} \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1+r}{1-r}\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $u(r)$:\n$$\nu(r) = \\frac{1-r^2}{\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{2}{1-r^2} \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1+r}{1-r}\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\right) \\right] = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1+r}{1-r}\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nNow we insert the specific values $r = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\alpha = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n$$\n\\frac{1+r}{1-r} = \\frac{1+\\frac{1}{2}}{1-\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 3\n$$\n$$\n\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) = \\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi/2}{2}\\right) = \\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = 1\n$$\nPlugging these values into the formula for $u(r)$:\n$$\nu\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\arctan(3 \\cdot 1) = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\arctan(3)\n$$\nThis is the final exact expression for the probability that the Brownian motion started at $(1/2, 0)$ exits the unit disk through the arc $\\{e^{i\\theta} : \\theta \\in [-\\pi/2, \\pi/2]\\}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{\\pi} \\arctan(3)}$$", "id": "3074775"}]}
