This is a specific case of a general Itô diffusion $dX_{t} = \\mu(X_{t})dt + \\sigma(X_{t})dW_{t}$, where the drift coefficient is $\\mu(x)=0$ and the diffusion coefficient is $\\sigma(x)=1$.\n\nThe infinitesimal generator $\\mathcal{A}$ of this diffusion process acts on a sufficiently smooth function $f$ (e.g., $f \\in C^{2}(\\mathbb{R})$) as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}f(x) = \\mu(x) \\frac{df}{dx}(x) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma(x)^{2} \\frac{d^{2}f}{dx^{2}}(x)\n$$\nFor the given process, the generator simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}f(x) = (0) \\frac{df}{dx}(x) + \\frac{1}{2} (1)^{2} \\frac{d^{2}f}{dx^{2}}(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d^{2}f}{dx^{2}}(x)\n$$\nA fundamental result in stochastic calculus, often derived from Itô's formula and related to Dynkin's formula, states that for a function $f$ in the domain of the generator, the process $f(X_t)$ is a local martingale if and only if $\\mathcal{A}f(x) = 0$ for all $x$ in the interior of the domain. For a bounded domain as we have here, $f(X_t)$ is a true martingale.\n\nLet us first find the probability $p_{1}(x) = \\mathbb{P}_{x}(X_{\\tau}=1)$. The quantity $p_{1}(X_{t})$ represents the probability of eventually hitting $1$ before $0$, given the process is at position $X_{t}$ at time $t$. By the nature of Brownian motion, this probability should not have a tendency to increase or decrease over time, which suggests that the process $Y_{t} = p_{1}(X_{t})$ should be a martingale. For $p_{1}(X_{t})$ to be a martingale, its \"infinitesimal drift\" must be zero, which is equivalent to the condition $\\mathcal{A}p_{1}(x)=0$ for $x \\in (0,1)$.\n\nThis can be more formally justified using Dynkin's formula. For a function $f$ and a stopping time $\\tau$ with finite expectation, the formula states $\\mathbb{E}_{x}[f(X_{\\tau})] = f(x) + \\mathbb{E}_{x}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\tau} (\\mathcal{A}f)(X_{s}) ds\\right]$. If we assume $\\mathcal{A}f(x) = 0$, this simplifies to $\\mathbb{E}_{x}[f(X_{\\tau})] = f(x)$. This relation serves as the basis for finding the hitting probabilities. Let's postulate that our hitting probability function $p_1(x)$ is such a function. Then it must satisfy $\\mathcal{A} p_1(x)=0$.\n\nSo, the function $p_{1}(x)$ must satisfy the ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}p_{1}(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d^{2}p_{1}}{dx^{2}}(x) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } x \\in (0,1)\n$$\nThis is equivalent to $\\frac{d^{2}p_{1}}{dx^{2}}(x) = 0$. The general solution is a linear function:\n$$\np_{1}(x) = c_{1}x + c_{2}\n$$\nwhere $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nThe boundary conditions for $p_{1}(x) = \\mathbb{P}_{x}(X_{\\tau}=1)$ are determined by considering the starting position $x_0$ at the boundaries of the interval $[0,1]$.\n- If the process starts at $x=1$, it is already at the boundary and is absorbed. The hitting time is $\\tau=0$ and the position is $X_{\\tau}=1$. Therefore, the probability of hitting $1$ is $1$. This gives the condition $p_{1}(1)=1$.\n- If the process starts at $x=0$, it is at the other boundary and is absorbed. The hitting time is $\\tau=0$ and the position is $X_{\\tau}=0$. Therefore, the probability of hitting $1$ is $0$. This gives the condition $p_{1}(0)=0$.\n\nWe apply these boundary conditions to the general solution:\n- $p_{1}(0) = c_{1}(0) + c_{2} = 0 \\implies c_{2} = 0$.\n- $p_{1}(1) = c_{1}(1) + c_{2} = c_{1} + 0 = 1 \\implies c_{1} = 1$.\n\nSubstituting the constants back into the general solution, we find the closed form for $p_{1}(x)$:\n$$\np_{1}(x) = x\n$$\nNext, we find $p_{0}(x) = \\mathbb{P}_{x}(X_{\\tau}=0)$. Since the process is in a bounded interval, the probability that it never hits the boundary is zero. Thus, it must hit either $0$ or $1$. This implies that the probabilities must sum to one:\n$$\np_{0}(x) + p_{1}(x) = 1\n$$\nUsing our result for $p_{1}(x)$, we immediately get:\n$$\np_{0}(x) = 1 - p_{1}(x) = 1 - x\n$$\nAlternatively, we can solve for $p_{0}(x)$ using the same procedure as for $p_{1}(x)$. The function $p_{0}(x)$ must also satisfy $\\mathcal{A}p_{0}(x)=0$, leading to the same general solution $p_{0}(x) = d_{1}x + d_{2}$. The boundary conditions for $p_{0}(x)$ are:\n- $p_{0}(0) = \\mathbb{P}_{0}(X_{\\tau}=0) = 1$.\n- $p_{0}(1) = \\mathbb{P}_{1}(X_{\\tau}=0) = 0$.\n\nApplying these conditions:\n- $p_{0}(0) = d_{1}(0) + d_{2} = 1 \\implies d_{2} = 1$.\n- $p_{0}(1) = d_{1}(1) + d_{2} = d_{1} + 1 = 0 \\implies d_{1} = -1$.\nThis gives the solution $p_{0}(x) = -x + 1$, which confirms the previous result.\n\nThe hitting probabilities for a standard Brownian motion starting at $x \\in (0,1)$ to be absorbed at the boundaries $0$ and $1$ are $p_{0}(x) = 1-x$ and $p_{1}(x) = x$, respectively.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1-x & x\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3059961"}, {"introduction": "Beyond calculating probabilities of specific events, the infinitesimal generator provides deep insights into the long-term stability and behavior of a stochastic process.

There are no contradictions.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is presented in four parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Infinitesimal Generator $L$**\n\nThe infinitesimal generator $L$ is defined by $Lf(x) = \\lim_{t\\downarrow 0} \\frac{T_t f(x) - f(x)}{t}$. The semigroup $T_t$ is given by $T_t f(x) = \\mathbb{E}^x[f(X_t)]$. By convention for killed processes, the function $f$ is extended to the cemetery state by setting its value to $0$. Thus, $T_t f(x) = \\mathbb{E}^x[f(B_t) \\mathbf{1}_{t<\\tau}]$.\n\nTo find the form of $L$, we consider its action on a sufficiently smooth function $f$. The natural domain of the generator for a process killed at the boundary of an interval $(a,b)$ is the set of functions which are twice continuously differentiable and vanish at the boundaries. So, let us consider $f \\in C^2[0, \\pi]$ such that $f(0)=0$ and $f(\\pi)=0$.\n\nBy Itô's formula applied to $f(B_s)$ up to the stopping time $t \\wedge \\tau = \\min(t, \\tau)$, we have:\n$$\nf(B_{t \\wedge \\tau}) - f(B_0) = \\int_0^{t \\wedge \\tau} f'(B_s) dB_s + \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^{t \\wedge \\tau} f''(B_s) ds\n$$\nTaking the expectation $\\mathbb{E}^x$ (with $B_0=x$), the stochastic integral term, which is a martingale, has an expectation of $0$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}^x[f(B_{t \\wedge \\tau})] - f(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbb{E}^x\\left[\\int_0^{t \\wedge \\tau} f''(B_s) ds\\right]\n$$\nThe left side can be expanded:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}^x[f(B_{t \\wedge \\tau})] = \\mathbb{E}^x[f(B_t)\\mathbf{1}_{t<\\tau} + f(B_\\tau)\\mathbf{1}_{t \\ge \\tau}]\n$$\nSince $X_0=x \\in (0, \\pi)$, at the stopping time $\\tau$, $B_\\tau$ is either $0$ or $\\pi$. As $f$ is in the assumed domain, $f(0)=f(\\pi)=0$, which implies $f(B_\\tau)=0$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}^x[f(B_{t \\wedge \\tau})] = \\mathbb{E}^x[f(B_t)\\mathbf{1}_{t<\\tau}] = T_t f(x)\n$$\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$\nT_t f(x) - f(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbb{E}^x\\left[\\int_0^{t \\wedge \\tau} f''(B_s) ds\\right]\n$$\nTo find $L f(x)$, we divide by $t$ and take the limit as $t \\downarrow 0$:\n$$\nLf(x) = \\lim_{t\\downarrow 0} \\frac{1}{t} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbb{E}^x\\left[\\int_0^{t \\wedge \\tau} f''(B_s) ds\\right] \\right)\n$$\nFor any starting point $x \\in (0, \\pi)$, the probability of exiting the interval in a small time $t$, $\\mathbb{P}^x(\\tau \\le t)$, goes to $0$ as $t \\downarrow 0$. Thus, in the limit, we can replace $t \\wedge \\tau$ with $t$. By the continuity of $B_s$ and $f''$, the integrand $f''(B_s)$ is continuous in $s$. By the fundamental theorem of calculus and dominated convergence (to move the limit inside the expectation):\n$$\nLf(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbb{E}^x\\left[ \\lim_{t\\downarrow 0} \\frac{1}{t} \\int_0^t f''(B_s) ds \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbb{E}^x[f''(B_0)] = \\frac{1}{2} f''(x)\n$$\nThe generator is thus the operator $L = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}$. Its natural domain $\\mathcal{D}(L)$ consists of functions in $C[0, \\pi]$ for which this limit exists and is continuous. This corresponds to the space of twice continuously differentiable functions on $[0, \\pi]$ that satisfy the boundary conditions imposed by the killing, which are Dirichlet boundary conditions.\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}(L) = \\{f \\in C^2[0, \\pi] : f(0)=0, f(\\pi)=0\\}\n$$\n\n**2. Eigenvalue Problem**\n\nWe need to solve the eigenvalue problem $L\\varphi = \\lambda \\varphi$ for $\\varphi \\in \\mathcal{D}(L)$.\nThe equation is $\\frac{1}{2} \\varphi''(x) = \\lambda \\varphi(x)$, with boundary conditions $\\varphi(0)=0$ and $\\varphi(\\pi)=0$.\nThis can be written as $\\varphi''(x) - 2\\lambda \\varphi(x) = 0$.\n\nCase 1: $\\lambda > 0$. Let $2\\lambda = k^2$ for $k>0$. The equation is $\\varphi''(x) - k^2\\varphi(x)=0$. The general solution is $\\varphi(x) = c_1 \\cosh(kx) + c_2 \\sinh(kx)$.\n$\\varphi(0)=0 \\implies c_1=0$. So $\\varphi(x) = c_2 \\sinh(kx)$.\n$\\varphi(\\pi)=0 \\implies c_2 \\sinh(k\\pi)=0$. Since $k>0$, $\\sinh(k\\pi) \\ne 0$, so $c_2=0$. This gives only the trivial solution $\\varphi(x)=0$.\n\nCase 2: $\\lambda = 0$. The equation is $\\varphi''(x)=0$, with general solution $\\varphi(x) = c_1 x + c_2$.\n$\\varphi(0)=0 \\implies c_2=0$. So $\\varphi(x) = c_1 x$.\n$\\varphi(\\pi)=0 \\implies c_1 \\pi=0 \\implies c_1=0$. This also gives only the trivial solution.\n\nCase 3: $\\lambda < 0$. Let $2\\lambda = -k^2$ for $k>0$. The equation is $\\varphi''(x) + k^2\\varphi(x)=0$. The general solution is $\\varphi(x) = c_1 \\cos(kx) + c_2 \\sin(kx)$.\n$\\varphi(0)=0 \\implies c_1 \\cos(0) + c_2 \\sin(0) = c_1 = 0$. So $\\varphi(x) = c_2 \\sin(kx)$.\n$\\varphi(\\pi)=0 \\implies c_2 \\sin(k\\pi)=0$. To have a non-trivial solution, we need $c_2 \\ne 0$, which implies $\\sin(k\\pi)=0$.\nThis requires $k\\pi = n\\pi$ for a positive integer $n$ (since $k>0$).\nThus, $k_n = n$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\n\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_n = -\\frac{k_n^2}{2} = -\\frac{n^2}{2}$.\nThe corresponding eigenfunctions (choosing $c_2=1$) are $\\varphi_n(x) = \\sin(nx)$.\nThe complete set of eigenfunctions is $\\{\\sin(nx)\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$ with corresponding eigenvalues $\\lambda_n = -\\frac{n^2}{2}$ for $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$.\n\n**3. Semigroup Evolution of Eigenfunctions**\n\nLet $\\varphi_n$ be an eigenfunction of $L$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda_n$. We want to find how $T_t \\varphi_n$ evolves in time. Consider the function $g(t,x) = T_t \\varphi_n(x)$. Differentiating with respect to $t$ and using the semigroup property $T_{t+h}=T_t T_h$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} T_t \\varphi_n(x) = \\lim_{h\\downarrow 0} \\frac{T_{t+h}\\varphi_n(x) - T_t\\varphi_n(x)}{h} = \\lim_{h\\downarrow 0} \\frac{T_t(T_h\\varphi_n(x)) - T_t\\varphi_n(x)}{h}\n$$\nSince $T_t$ is a linear operator, we can write this as:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} T_t \\varphi_n(x) = T_t \\left( \\lim_{h\\downarrow 0} \\frac{T_h\\varphi_n(x) - \\varphi_n(x)}{h} \\right) = T_t (L\\varphi_n(x))\n$$\nSince $L\\varphi_n = \\lambda_n \\varphi_n$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} T_t \\varphi_n(x) = T_t (\\lambda_n \\varphi_n(x)) = \\lambda_n (T_t \\varphi_n(x))\n$$\nFor a fixed $x$, this is a simple ordinary differential equation for $g(t) = T_t \\varphi_n(x)$: $g'(t) = \\lambda_n g(t)$.\nThe solution is $g(t) = C \\exp(\\lambda_n t)$. The constant $C$ is determined by the initial condition at $t=0$: $g(0) = T_0 \\varphi_n(x) = \\varphi_n(x)$.\nThus, the evolution of an eigenfunction is given by:\n$$\nT_t \\varphi_n(x) = \\exp(\\lambda_n t) \\varphi_n(x)\n$$\nNow, consider a finite linear combination of eigenfunctions, $f(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^N c_k \\varphi_k(x)$. By the linearity of the semigroup operator $T_t$:\n$$\nT_t f(x) = T_t\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^N c_k \\varphi_k(x)\\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^N c_k T_t \\varphi_k(x)\n$$\nSubstituting the evolution rule for each eigenfunction, we get the representation:\n$$\nT_t f(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^N c_k \\exp(\\lambda_k t) \\varphi_k(x)\n$$\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\nWe are given the function $f(x) = \\sin(3x) + 2\\sin(5x)$.\nThis is a linear combination of the eigenfunctions $\\varphi_3(x) = \\sin(3x)$ and $\\varphi_5(x) = \\sin(5x)$, with coefficients $c_3=1$ and $c_5=2$.\nThe corresponding eigenvalues are $\\lambda_3 = -\\frac{3^2}{2} = -\\frac{9}{2}$ and $\\lambda_5 = -\\frac{5^2}{2} = -\\frac{25}{2}$.\nWe need to compute $(T_t f)(x)$ for $t = 2\\ln 2$ and evaluate it at $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nUsing the formula from part 3:\n$$\nT_{2\\ln 2} f(x) = c_3 \\exp(\\lambda_3 (2\\ln 2)) \\varphi_3(x) + c_5 \\exp(\\lambda_5 (2\\ln 2)) \\varphi_5(x)\n$$\n$$\nT_{2\\ln 2} f(x) = 1 \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{9}{2} \\cdot 2\\ln 2\\right) \\sin(3x) + 2 \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{25}{2} \\cdot 2\\ln 2\\right) \\sin(5x)\n$$\nLet's simplify the exponential terms:\n$$\n\\exp(-9\\ln 2) = \\exp(\\ln(2^{-9})) = 2^{-9}\n$$\n$$\n\\exp(-25\\ln 2) = \\exp(\\ln(2^{-25})) = 2^{-25}\n$$\nSo, the expression for $T_{2\\ln 2} f(x)$ becomes:\n$$\nT_{2\\ln 2} f(x) = 2^{-9} \\sin(3x) + 2 \\cdot 2^{-25} \\sin(5x) = 2^{-9} \\sin(3x) + 2^{-24} \\sin(5x)\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this expression at $x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$:\n$$\n(T_{2\\ln 2} f)\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = 2^{-9} \\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right) + 2^{-24} \\sin\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThe values of the trigonometric functions are:\n$$\n\\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right) = -1\n$$\n$$\n\\sin\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2\\pi\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = 1\n$$\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\n(T_{2\\ln 2} f)\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = 2^{-9}(-1) + 2^{-24}(1) = -2^{-9} + 2^{-24}\n$$\nTo combine these terms, we use a common denominator of $2^{24}$:\n$$\n-2^{-9} + 2^{-24} = -\\frac{1}{2^9} + \\frac{1}{2^{24}} = -\\frac{2^{15}}{2^{24}} + \\frac{1}{2^{24}} = \\frac{1 - 2^{15}}{2^{24}}\n$$\nThus, the exact value is $\\frac{1 - 2^{15}}{2^{24}}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1-2^{15}}{2^{24}}}\n$$", "id": "3059971"}]}
