It is a standard problem in the theory of stochastic processes, relying on fundamental definitions and properties of Brownian motion. All necessary information is provided, and the problem is free from any logical contradictions or factual unsoundness. We may therefore proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nLet $\\{B_t : t \\ge 0\\}$ be a one-dimensional standard Brownian motion starting from $B_0 = 0$. The defining properties we shall use are:\n1. For any $0 \\le s  t$, the increment $B_t - B_s$ is a Gaussian random variable with mean $0$ and variance $t-s$, i.e., $B_t - B_s \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t-s)$. Increments over disjoint time intervals are independent. This implies stationarity and independence of increments.\n2. The sample paths $t \\mapsto B_t(\\omega)$ are continuous almost surely.\n3. The process possesses the strong Markov property, which states that for any stopping time $\\tau$ with respect to the natural filtration of $B_t$, the process $\\{B_{\\tau+t} - B_\\tau : t \\ge 0\\}$ is a standard Brownian motion independent of the pre-$\\tau$ sigma-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_\\tau$.\n\nWe are asked to find the probability density function (PDF) of the first passage time $\\tau_a = \\inf\\{t \\ge 0 : B_t = a\\}$ for a fixed level $a  0$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in two main steps. First, we determine the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of $\\tau_a$, denoted $F_{\\tau_a}(t) = \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t)$. Second, we differentiate the CDF to obtain the PDF, $f_{\\tau_a}(t)$.\n\n**Step 1: Derivation of the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of $\\tau_a$**\n\nWe aim to show that for any $t  0$, $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t) = \\mathbb{P}(|B_t| \\ge a)$.\nConsider the event $\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}$, which means the process reaches level $a$ at or before time $t$. We can partition this event based on the value of $B_t$. Using the law of total probability, we write:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t) = \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t, B_t \\ge a) + \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t, B_t  a)\n$$\nLet's analyze the first term. Since $B_0 = 0$ and the sample paths are continuous, for the process to reach a value $B_t \\ge a$, it must have passed through the level $a$ at some time less than or equal to $t$. This means that the event $\\{B_t \\ge a\\}$ implies the event $\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}$. Therefore, the intersection is simply the event $\\{B_t \\ge a\\}$:\n$$\n\\{\\tau_a \\le t, B_t \\ge a\\} = \\{B_t \\ge a\\}\n$$\nThus, the first term becomes $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t, B_t \\ge a) = \\mathbb{P}(B_t \\ge a)$.\n\nNow, we analyze the second term, $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t, B_t  a)$, using the strong Markov property at the stopping time $\\tau_a$.\nOn the event $\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}$, the strong Markov property implies that the process $X_s := B_{\\tau_a + s} - B_{\\tau_a}$ for $s \\ge 0$ is a standard Brownian motion that is independent of the filtration $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a}$. By continuity, $B_{\\tau_a} = a$.\nThe condition $B_t  a$ can be rewritten in terms of the post-$\\tau_a$ process. On the set $\\{\\omega : \\tau_a(\\omega) \\le t\\}$, we have:\n$$\nB_t = B_{\\tau_a + (t - \\tau_a)} = B_{\\tau_a} + (B_{\\tau_a + (t - \\tau_a)} - B_{\\tau_a}) = a + X_{t-\\tau_a}\n$$\nSo the condition $B_t  a$ is equivalent to $a + X_{t-\\tau_a}  a$, which simplifies to $X_{t-\\tau_a}  0$.\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t, B_t  a) = \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t, X_{t-\\tau_a}  0)\n$$\nWe can evaluate this probability using conditioning. Let $\\mathbb{I}_A$ be the indicator function for an event $A$.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t, B_t  a) = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{I}_{\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}} \\mathbb{I}_{\\{B_t  a\\}}] \\\\\n= \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{I}_{\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}} \\mathbb{I}_{\\{B_t  a\\}} | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a}]] \\\\\n= \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{I}_{\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}} \\mathbb{P}(B_t  a | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a})] \\quad \\text{(since } \\{\\tau_a \\le t\\} \\in \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a})\n\\end{align*}\nOn the event $\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}$, we have $B_t  a \\iff X_{t-\\tau_a}  0$. Since the process $X$ is independent of $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a}$, and $\\tau_a$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a}$-measurable, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(B_t  a | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a}) = \\mathbb{P}(X_{t-\\tau_a}  0 | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a}) = \\mathbb{P}(X_{t-\\tau_a}  0)\n$$\nThe random variable $X_{t-\\tau_a}$ follows a normal distribution centered at $0$. By the symmetry of the Gaussian distribution, $\\mathbb{P}(X_{t-\\tau_a}  0) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThis gives:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t, B_t  a) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbb{I}_{\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t)\n$$\nSubstituting our findings for both terms back into the original equation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t) = \\mathbb{P}(B_t \\ge a) + \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t)\n$$\nSolving for $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t)$, we find:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t) = \\mathbb{P}(B_t \\ge a) \\implies \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t) = 2 \\mathbb{P}(B_t \\ge a)\n$$\nThis result is known as the reflection principle. To complete the first part of the problem, we must relate this to $\\mathbb{P}(|B_t| \\ge a)$.\nFor a standard Brownian motion, $B_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,t)$. The distribution of $B_t$ is symmetric about $0$. Thus, for any $a  0$, $\\mathbb{P}(B_t \\ge a) = \\mathbb{P}(B_t \\le -a)$.\nThe event $\\{|B_t| \\ge a\\}$ is the disjoint union of $\\{B_t \\ge a\\}$ and $\\{B_t \\le -a\\}$ (since $\\mathbb{P}(B_t=a)=0$).\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(|B_t| \\ge a) = \\mathbb{P}(B_t \\ge a) + \\mathbb{P}(B_t \\le -a) = \\mathbb{P}(B_t \\ge a) + \\mathbb{P}(B_t \\ge a) = 2 \\mathbb{P}(B_t \\ge a)\n$$\nComparing this with our derived expression for $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t)$, we have established the required identity:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t) = \\mathbb{P}(|B_t| \\ge a)\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Derivation of the Probability Density Function (PDF) of $\\tau_a$**\n\nThe CDF of $\\tau_a$ for $t  0$ is $F_{\\tau_a}(t) = \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t) = 2 \\mathbb{P}(B_t \\ge a)$.\nLet $Z$ be a standard normal random variable, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$.
