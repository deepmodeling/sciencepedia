We begin by validating that $\\{M_{t}\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ is a martingale with respect to the filtration $\\{\\mathcal{F}_{t}\\}_{t \\geq 0}$.\n\nA stochastic process $\\{M_{t}\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ is a martingale with respect to a filtration $\\{\\mathcal{F}_{t}\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ if it satisfies the following three conditions for all $t \\geq 0$:\n1. $M_{t}$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$-measurable for all $t \\geq 0$ (i.e., the process is adapted).\n2. $E[|M_{t}|] < \\infty$ for all $t \\geq 0$ (i.e., the process is integrable).\n3. For any $s, t$ with $0 \\leq s < t$, $E[M_{t} | \\mathcal{F}_{s}] = M_{s}$.\n\nWe now verify these conditions for the process $M_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} u \\, dW_{u}$, where the integrand is the deterministic process $H_{u} = u$.\n\n**Condition 1: Adaptedness**\nThe Itô integral $M_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} H_{u} \\, dW_{u}$ is constructed as a limit of sums involving increments of the Wiener process $\\{W_{u}\\}$ up to time $t$. By its very construction, the value of $M_{t}$ depends only on the path of the Wiener process over the interval $[0, t]$. Therefore, $M_{t}$ is measurable with respect to the information available at time $t$, which is captured by the sigma-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_{t} = \\sigma(\\{W_{u} : 0 \\leq u \\leq t\\})$. Thus, $\\{M_{t}\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ is an adapted process. This condition is satisfied.\n\n**Condition 2: Integrability**\nTo show that $M_{t}$ is integrable, i.e., $E[|M_{t}|] < \\infty$, it is sufficient to show that its second moment is finite, $E[M_{t}^{2}] < \\infty$. This is because the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality implies $(E[|M_{t}|])^{2} \\leq E[M_{t}^{2}]$. For the Itô integral $M_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} H_{u} \\, dW_{u}$, a sufficient condition for $E[M_{t}^{2}] < \\infty$ is that the integrand $H_{u}$ satisfies $E\\left[\\int_{0}^{t} H_{u}^{2} \\, du\\right] < \\infty$. In our case, the integrand is $H_{u} = u$. We check this condition:\n$$\nE\\left[\\int_{0}^{t} H_{u}^{2} \\, du\\right] = E\\left[\\int_{0}^{t} u^{2} \\, du\\right]\n$$\nSince the integrand $u^{2}$ is a deterministic function of time, the integral $\\int_{0}^{t} u^{2} \\, du$ is a deterministic quantity. Therefore, its expectation is simply the value of the integral itself.\n$$\nE\\left[\\int_{0}^{t} u^{2} \\, du\\right] = \\int_{0}^{t} u^{2} \\, du = \\left[ \\frac{u^{3}}{3} \\right]_{0}^{t} = \\frac{t^{3}}{3}\n$$\nSince $\\frac{t^{3}}{3}$ is finite for any finite time $t \\geq 0$, the condition is satisfied. This implies $E[M_{t}^{2}] < \\infty$ and consequently $E[|M_{t}|] < \\infty$. Thus, the process is integrable.\n\n**Condition 3: Martingale Property**\nWe must show that for any $0 \\leq s < t$, the property $E[M_{t} | \\mathcal{F}_{s}] = M_{s}$ holds. We can split the integral defining $M_{t}$ at time $s$:\n$$\nM_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} u \\, dW_{u} = \\int_{0}^{s} u \\, dW_{u} + \\int_{s}^{t} u \\, dW_{u} = M_{s} + \\int_{s}^{t} u \\, dW_{u}\n$$\nNow, we take the conditional expectation with respect to $\\mathcal{F}_{s}$:\n$$\nE[M_{t} | \\mathcal{F}_{s}] = E\\left[M_{s} + \\int_{s}^{t} u \\, dW_{u} \\Big| \\mathcal{F}_{s}\\right]\n$$\nBy the linearity of conditional expectation, this becomes:\n$$\nE[M_{t} | \\mathcal{F}_{s}] = E[M_{s} | \\mathcal{F}_{s}] + E\\left[\\int_{s}^{t} u \\, dW_{u} \\Big| \\mathcal{F}_{s}\\right]\n$$\nFor the first term, $M_{s}$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{s}$-measurable (as established in Condition 1). Therefore, taking the conditional expectation given $\\mathcal{F}_{s}$ does not change its value: $E[M_{s} | \\mathcal{F}_{s}] = M_{s}$.\n\nFor the second term, the Itô integral $\\int_{s}^{t} u \\, dW_{u}$ is defined over the time interval $(s, t]$. It is a fundamental property of Itô integrals that if the integrand is adapted and satisfies the integrability condition on $[s, t]$, the integral's expectation is zero. Furthermore, the increments of the Wiener process $\\{W_{u} - W_{s}\\}_{u > s}$ are independent of the filtration $\\mathcal{F}_{s}$. The integral $\\int_{s}^{t} u \\, dW_{u}$ is a function of these future increments. Consequently, the integral is independent of $\\mathcal{F}_{s}$. The conditional expectation of a random variable that is independent of the conditioning sigma-algebra is just its unconditional expectation:\n$$\nE\\left[\\int_{s}^{t} u \\, dW_{u} \\Big| \\mathcal{F}_{s}\\right] = E\\left[\\int_{s}^{t} u \\, dW_{u}\\right]\n$$\nThe expected value of this Itô integral is zero, as the condition $E\\left[\\int_{s}^{t} u^{2} \\, du\\right] = \\int_{s}^{t} u^{2} \\, du = \\frac{t^{3}-s^{3}}{3} < \\infty$ holds. Thus:\n$$\nE\\left[\\int_{s}^{t} u \\, dW_{u}\\right] = 0\n$$\nSubstituting these results back, we obtain:\n$$\nE[M_{t} | \\mathcal{F}_{s}] = M_{s} + 0 = M_{s}\n$$\nThis confirms the third condition. Since all three conditions are satisfied, $\\{M_{t}\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ is a martingale with respect to its natural filtration $\\{\\mathcal{F}_{t}\\}_{t \\geq 0}$.\n\n**Derivation of the Variance**\nThe problem also asks for the variance of $M_{t}$, denoted $\\mathrm{Var}(M_{t})$. By definition, $\\mathrm{Var}(M_{t}) = E[(M_{t} - E[M_{t}])^{2}]$.\n\nFirst, we find the expectation of $M_{t}$. As shown above while verifying Condition 3 for $s=0$, the expectation of an Itô integral with a suitable integrand is zero:\n$$\nE[M_{t}] = E\\left[\\int_{0}^{t} u \\, dW_{u}\\right] = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the variance simplifies to the second moment:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(M_{t}) = E[(M_{t} - 0)^{2}] = E[M_{t}^{2}]\n$$\nTo calculate $E[M_{t}^{2}]$, we use the Itô isometry property, which states that for a suitable integrand $H_{u}$:\n$$\nE\\left[\\left(\\int_{0}^{t} H_{u} \\, dW_{u}\\right)^{2}\\right] = E\\left[\\int_{0}^{t} H_{u}^{2} \\, du\\right]\n$$\nApplying this to our process with $H_{u} = u$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(M_{t}) = E[M_{t}^{2}] = E\\left[\\left(\\int_{0}^{t} u \\, dW_{u}\\right)^{2}\\right] = E\\left[\\int_{0}^{t} u^{2} \\, du\\right]\n$$\nAs calculated previously while verifying the integrability condition, the integral $\\int_{0}^{t} u^{2} \\, du$ is a deterministic value, so its expectation is the value itself:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(M_{t}) = \\int_{0}^{t} u^{2} \\, du = \\left[ \\frac{u^{3}}{3} \\right]_{0}^{t} = \\frac{t^{3}}{3} - 0 = \\frac{t^{3}}{3}\n$$\nThis expression describes the evolution of the variability of the process $M_{t}$ over time. The variance grows cubically with time $t$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{t^{3}}{3}}\n$$", "id": "3064968"}, {"introduction": "Having mastered the deterministic case, we now generalize to integrands that are themselves stochastic processes.

By linearity of expectation:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}\\left[S_t^{(n)}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} W_{t_k+\\epsilon}\\,\\bigl(W_{t_{k+1}}-W_{t_k}\\bigr)\\right] = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\mathbb{E}\\left[W_{t_k+\\epsilon}\\,\\bigl(W_{t_{k+1}}-W_{t_k}\\bigr)\\right] $$\nConsider a single term in the sum:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}\\left[W_{t_k+\\epsilon}\\,(W_{t_{k+1}}-W_{t_k})\\right] = \\mathbb{E}[W_{t_k+\\epsilon}W_{t_{k+1}}] - \\mathbb{E}[W_{t_k+\\epsilon}W_{t_k}] $$\nUsing the covariance property $\\mathbb{E}[W_s W_u] = \\min(s, u)$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[W_{t_k+\\epsilon}W_{t_{k+1}}] - \\mathbb{E}[W_{t_k+\\epsilon}W_{t_k}] = \\min(t_k+\\epsilon, t_{k+1}) - \\min(t_k+\\epsilon, t_k) $$\nThe condition $\\Delta_n < \\epsilon$ implies $t_{k+1} - t_k < \\epsilon$, or $t_{k+1} < t_k + \\epsilon$. Since $t_k < t_{k+1}$, the time ordering is $t_k < t_{k+1} < t_k+\\epsilon$.\nTherefore, $\\min(t_k+\\epsilon, t_{k+1}) = t_{k+1}$ and $\\min(t_k+\\epsilon, t_k) = t_k$.\nThe expectation of the term becomes:\n$$ t_{k+1} - t_k = \\Delta_n $$\nSumming over all terms from $k=0$ to $n-1$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}\\left[S_t^{(n)}\\right] = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\Delta_n = n \\cdot \\Delta_n = n \\cdot \\frac{t}{n} = t $$\nThis holds for any $t \\ge 0$ (for $t=0$, the sum is empty and equals $0$). The first part of the statement is correct.\n\nThe problem states that $S_t^{(n)} \\to I_t$ in $L^2(\\mathbb{P})$.

Let's consider $t=0$. The sum $S_0^{(n)}$ is over the interval $[0,0]$, so it is an empty sum, which is $0$. Thus, $I_0 = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} S_0^{(n)} = 0$. If $I$ were a martingale, we would need $\\mathbb{E}[I_t] = \\mathbb{E}[I_0] = 0$ for all $t > 0$. However, we found $\\mathbb{E}[I_t] = t$. For any $t>0$, $t \\ne 0$. Therefore, $I$ cannot be an $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$-martingale.

A necessary condition for predictability is that the process must be adapted, meaning that for every $s \\ge 0$, the random variable $X_s$ must be $\\mathcal{F}_s$-measurable.\nIn this problem, the integrand is $H_s = W_{s+\\epsilon}$. The filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_s)$ is the natural filtration generated by the Brownian motion up to time $s$, i.e., $\\mathcal{F}_s = \\sigma(W_u: 0 \\le u \\le s)$ (augmented).\nThe random variable $H_s = W_{s+\\epsilon}$ depends on the path of the Brownian motion at a future time $s+\\epsilon$. Since $\\epsilon > 0$, the increment $W_{s+\\epsilon}-W_s$ is independent of the sigma-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_s$. Therefore, $W_{s+\\epsilon}$ is not $\\mathcal{F}_s$-measurable. The process $H$ is not adapted to $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$, and consequently, it is not predictable.\nBecause the integrand is not predictable, the classical Itô integral $\\int_0^t W_{s+\\epsilon}\\,dW_s$ is not well-defined. The first part of the statement is false, making the entire statement incorrect.\n\nVerdict for B: **Incorrect**.\n\n#### Option C Evaluation\n\nThis option states that the Itô integral is not defined because $H$ is not predictable, and that this lack of predictability causes a nonzero drift, preventing the martingale property.\n\nThe first part, \"The classical Itô integral with integrand $H_t=W_{t+\\epsilon}$ is not defined with respect to $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$ because $H$ is not predictable,\" is correct, as established in the analysis of Option B.\n\nLet's analyze the second part: \"...and this lack of predictability is precisely what produces a nonzero drift in the forward-sum limit above, preventing the martingale property.\"\nFor a predictable integrand $X$, the corresponding Riemann sum $\\sum X_{t_k}(W_{t_{k+1}}-W_{t_k})$ has zero expectation. This is because $X_{t_k}$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{t_k}$-measurable and $W_{t_{k+1}}-W_{t_k}$ is independent of $\\mathcal{F}_{t_k}$ with zero mean:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X_{t_k}(W_{t_{k+1}}-W_{t_k})] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[X_{t_k}(W_{t_{k+1}}-W_{t_k})|\\mathcal{F}_{t_k}]] = \\mathbb{E}[X_{t_k} \\mathbb{E}[W_{t_{k+1}}-W_{t_k}|\\mathcal{F}_{t_k}]] = \\mathbb{E}[X_{t_k} \\cdot 0] = 0. $$\nThis fundamentally relies on the integrand's value at time $t_k$ being part of the information available at time $t_k$.\nIn the given problem, the integrand $H_{t_k} = W_{t_k+\\epsilon}$ is not $\\mathcal{F}_{t_k}$-measurable. This violation of predictability means the above argument fails. Instead, there is a non-zero correlation between the integrand $W_{t_k+\\epsilon}$ and the increment $W_{t_{k+1}}-W_{t_k}$, which we explicitly calculated in the analysis of Option A to be $\\mathbb{E}[H_{t_k}(W_{t_{k+1}}-W_{t_k})] = \\Delta_n$.\nThis non-zero expectation for each term in the sum leads to the overall non-zero expectation, or \"drift\" ($\\mathbb{E}[I_t]=t$). This drift, in turn, violates the constant-expectation requirement for martingales. Thus, the statement accurately identifies the lack of predictability as the fundamental reason for the non-martingale nature of the resulting limit process $I$.\n\nVerdict for C: **Correct**.\n\n#### Option D Evaluation\n\nThis option suggests enlarging the filtration to $\\mathcal{G}_t := \\mathcal{F}_{t+\\epsilon}$ and claims that $W$ remains a Brownian motion with respect to $(\\mathcal{G}_t)$ and $I$ becomes a $(\\mathcal{G}_t)$-martingale.\n\nLet's check the first claim: \"W remains a Brownian motion with respect to $(\\mathcal{G}_t)$\".\nFor $W$ to be a $(\\mathcal{G}_t)$-Brownian motion, one of the requirements is that for any $s < t$, the increment $W_t - W_s$ must be independent of the sigma-algebra $\\mathcal{G}_s$.\nHere, $\\mathcal{G}_s = \\mathcal{F}_{s+\\epsilon} = \\sigma(W_u: 0 \\le u \\le s+\\epsilon)$.\nLet us choose times $s$ and $t$ such that $s < t < s+\\epsilon$. For example, let $t = s + \\epsilon/2$. The increment is $W_{s+\\epsilon/2} - W_s$.\nThe random variable $W_{s+\\epsilon/2}$ is, by definition, measurable with respect to $\\mathcal{F}_{s+\\epsilon} = \\mathcal{G}_s$. Similarly, $W_s$ is $\\mathcal{G}_s$-measurable. Thus, their difference, the increment $W_t - W_s$, is a $\\mathcal{G}_s$-measurable random variable.\nA non-constant random variable cannot be both measurable with respect to a sigma-algebra and independent of it. Therefore, $W_t - W_s$ is not independent of $\\mathcal{G}_s$.\nThe independence of increments property fails. Thus, $W$ is not a Brownian motion with respect to the enlarged filtration $(\\mathcal{G}_t)$. The first part of the statement is false.\n\nSince the statement is a conjunction (\"P and Q\"), and P is false, the entire statement is false.\n\nVerdict for D: **Incorrect**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, statements A and C are correct, while B and D are incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "3064973"}]}
