Let $M_t = \\max_{0 \\le s \\le t} B_s$. The problem asks for the conditional probability that a detection event occurred, given the final state of the process. In mathematical terms, we need to calculate $P(M_t \\ge a | B_t = x)$.\n\nWe are given that $x=1.5$ mV and $a=3.5$ mV, so we are in the case where the final value $x$ is less than the threshold $a$.\n\nTo calculate this conditional probability, we can use the definition involving probability densities:\n$$P(M_t \\ge a | B_t = x) = \\frac{f(M_t \\ge a, B_t=x)}{f_{B_t}(x)}$$\nwhere $f_{B_t}(x)$ is the probability density function (PDF) of the Brownian motion at time $t$, and $f(M_t \\ge a, B_t=x)$ is the joint density for the event that the maximum is at least $a$ and the final position is $x$.\n\nThe reflection principle for Brownian motion is the key to finding the numerator. The principle states that for any path starting at $B_0=0$ that reaches the level $a$ and subsequently ends at a level $x  a$ at time $t$, there is a corresponding path that ends at level $2a-x$ at time $t$. This correspondence is a measure-preserving bijection created by reflecting the portion of the path after the first time it hits level $a$. Consequently, the density of paths that have a maximum of at least $a$ and end at $x$ is equal to the density of paths that simply end at $2a-x$.\n\nTherefore, we have the crucial relationship:\n$$f(M_t \\ge a, B_t=x) = f_{B_t}(2a-x)$$\n\nThe PDF of a standard Brownian motion $B_t$ at time $t$ is a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance $t$, given by:\n$$f_{B_t}(y) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^2}{2t}\\right)$$\n\nSubstituting these into the conditional probability formula:\n$$P(M_t \\ge a | B_t = x) = \\frac{f_{B_t}(2a-x)}{f_{B_t}(x)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(2a-x)^2}{2t}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2t}\\right)}$$\n\nThe normalization constant $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}}$ cancels out, leaving:\n$$P(M_t \\ge a | B_t = x) = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(2a-x)^2}{2t}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2t}\\right)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(2a-x)^2 - x^2}{2t}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we simplify the term in the exponent:\n$$(2a-x)^2 - x^2 = (4a^2 - 4ax + x^2) - x^2 = 4a^2 - 4ax = 4a(a-x)$$\n\nSubstituting this back into the probability expression gives the general formula:\n$$P(M_t \\ge a | B_t = x) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4a(a-x)}{2t}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2a(a-x)}{t}\\right)$$\n\nNow we plug in the numerical values given in the problem: $a = 3.5$, $t = 25$, and $x = 1.5$.
