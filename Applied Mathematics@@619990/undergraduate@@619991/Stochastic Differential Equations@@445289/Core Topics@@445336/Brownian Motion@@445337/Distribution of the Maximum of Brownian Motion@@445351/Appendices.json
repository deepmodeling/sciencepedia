It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and free of any flaws. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $\\{B_s\\}_{s \\geq 0}$ be a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion with $B_0=0$. The running maximum up to time $t > 0$ is defined as $M_t := \\sup_{0 \\leq s \\leq t} B_s$. We are tasked with finding the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and probability density function (PDF) of $M_t$, and then computing its expectation $E[M_t]$.\n\nFirst, we derive the CDF of $M_t$, which is $F_{M_t}(m) = P(M_t \\leq m)$ for any real number $m$. Since $B_0 = 0$ and the paths of Brownian motion are continuous, the maximum $M_t$ must be non-negative, i.e., $M_t \\geq B_0 = 0$. Therefore, for any $m  0$, $P(M_t \\leq m) = 0$. We now consider the case where $m \\geq 0$.\n\nThe core tool for this derivation is the reflection principle for Brownian motion. The principle states that for any level $m>0$, the probability that the maximum $M_t$ has exceeded $m$ is twice the probability that the process value $B_t$ is greater than $m$.\nLet's analyze the event $\\{M_t \\geq m\\}$. This is equivalent to saying that the Brownian path hits or crosses the level $m$ at some time $s \\in [0, t]$. Let $\\tau_m = \\inf\\{s \\geq 0 : B_s = m\\}$ be the first hitting time of the level $m$. Then the event $\\{M_t \\geq m\\}$ is identical to the event $\\{\\tau_m \\leq t\\}$.\nWe can decompose this event based on the final position $B_t$:\n$$\nP(M_t \\geq m) = P(M_t \\geq m, B_t \\geq m) + P(M_t \\geq m, B_t  m)\n$$\nIf $B_t \\geq m$, then it is certain that the maximum $M_t$ is also at least $m$, so $M_t \\geq B_t \\geq m$. Thus, the event $\\{M_t \\geq m, B_t \\geq m\\}$ is simply the event $\\{B_t \\geq m\\}$.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$$\nP(M_t \\geq m) = P(B_t \\geq m) + P(M_t \\geq m, B_t  m)\n$$\nThe reflection principle states that $P(M_t \\geq m, B_t  m) = P(B_t > m)$. Briefly, this is because any path that hits $m$ and ends up below $m$ can be \"reflected\" about the line $y=m$ after its first hitting time $\\tau_m$. The reflected path from $\\tau_m$ onwards corresponds to a path that hits $m$ and ends up above $m$. By the strong Markov property of Brownian motion, these two sets of paths have equal probability.\nSince the distribution of $B_t$ is continuous (normal distribution), we have $P(B_t \\geq m) = P(B_t > m)$.\nSubstituting this into the equation for $P(M_t \\geq m)$, we get:\n$$\nP(M_t \\geq m) = P(B_t > m) + P(B_t > m) = 2 P(B_t > m)\n$$\nThe random variable $B_t$ is normally distributed with mean $0$ and variance $t$, i.e., $B_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t)$. We can express this in terms of the standard normal variable $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ as $B_t \\stackrel{d}{=} \\sqrt{t}Z$.\n$$\nP(B_t > m) = P(\\sqrt{t}Z > m) = P(Z > \\frac{m}{\\sqrt{t}}) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{m}{\\sqrt{t}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\Phi(\\cdot)$ is the CDF of the standard normal distribution.\nTherefore, for $m \\geq 0$:\n$$\nP(M_t \\geq m) = 2 \\left(1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{m}{\\sqrt{t}}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThe CDF of $M_t$ is $F_{M_t}(m) = P(M_t \\leq m) = 1 - P(M_t > m)$. Since $M_t$ has a continuous distribution, $P(M_t > m) = P(M_t \\geq m)$.\n$$\nF_{M_t}(m) = 1 - 2 \\left(1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{m}{\\sqrt{t}}\\right)\\right) = 2\\Phi\\left(\\frac{m}{\\sqrt{t}}\\right) - 1, \\quad \\text{for } m \\geq 0\n$$\nAnd $F_{M_t}(m) = 0$ for $m0$.\n\nNext, we find the probability density function (PDF) of $M_t$, $f_{M_t}(m)$, by differentiating the CDF for $m \\geq 0$:\n$$\nf_{M_t}(m) = \\frac{d}{dm} F_{M_t}(m) = \\frac{d}{dm} \\left(2\\Phi\\left(\\frac{m}{\\sqrt{t}}\\right) - 1\\right)\n$$\nLet $\\phi(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\Phi(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp(-x^2/2)$ be the PDF of the standard normal distribution. Using the chain rule:\n$$\nf_{M_t}(m) = 2 \\phi\\left(\\frac{m}{\\sqrt{t}}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{d}{dm}\\left(\\frac{m}{\\sqrt{t}}\\right) = 2 \\phi\\left(\\frac{m}{\\sqrt{t}}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{t}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\phi(\\cdot)$:\n$$\nf_{M_t}(m) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{t}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{m}{\\sqrt{t}}\\right)^2\\right) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m^2}{2t}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m^2}{2t}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the PDF for $m \\geq 0$. For $m  0$, $f_{M_t}(m) = 0$. This distribution is known as a folded normal distribution. It is noteworthy that $M_t$ has the same distribution as $|B_t|$.\n\nNow we compute the expectation $E[M_t]$:\n$$\nE[M_t] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} m f_{M_t}(m) dm = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} m f_{M_t}(m) dm\n$$\n$$\nE[M_t] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} m \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m^2}{2t}\\right)\\right) dm = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi t}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} m \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m^2}{2t}\\right) dm\n$$\nTo evaluate the integral, we use the substitution $u = \\frac{m^2}{2t}$. This gives $du = \\frac{2m}{2t} dm = \\frac{m}{t} dm$, so $m \\, dm = t \\, du$. The limits of integration remain from $0$ to $\\infty$.\n$$\nE[M_t] = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi t}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u) (t \\, du) = t \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi t}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-u} du\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-u} du = [-e^{-u}]_0^\\infty = 0 - (-1) = 1$.\n$$\nE[M_t] = t \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi t}} \\cdot 1 = \\sqrt{t^2 \\cdot \\frac{2}{\\pi t}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2t}{\\pi}}\n$$\n\nFinally, we use the Brownian scaling property to justify this result. The scaling property states that for any constant $c>0$, the process $W_s = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}}B_{cs}$ is also a standard Brownian motion. Let us choose $c=t$. Then the process $W_s = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{t}} B_{ts}$ defined for $s \\geq 0$ is a standard Brownian motion.\nWe can express $M_t$ in terms of this new process $W_s$. Note that $B_{ts} = \\sqrt{t} W_s$.\n$$\nM_t = \\sup_{0 \\leq u \\leq t} B_u\n$$\nLet's change the variable of the supremum to $s = u/t$. As $u$ ranges from $0$ to $t$, $s$ ranges from $0$ to $1$.\n$$\nM_t = \\sup_{0 \\leq s \\leq 1} B_{ts} = \\sup_{0 \\leq s \\leq 1} (\\sqrt{t} W_s) = \\sqrt{t} \\sup_{0 \\leq s \\leq 1} W_s\n$$\nThe term $\\sup_{0 \\leq s \\leq 1} W_s$ is the maximum of the standard Brownian motion $W$ over the time interval $[0,1]$. Let's denote this as $M_{W,1}$. Since $W$ is a standard Brownian motion, the distribution of its maximum over $[0,1]$ is identical to the distribution of the maximum of the original Brownian motion $B$ over $[0,1]$, which is $M_1$. Thus, $M_{W,1} \\stackrel{d}{=} M_1$.\nThis leads to the equality in distribution:\n$$\nM_t \\stackrel{d}{=} \\sqrt{t} M_1\n$$\nTaking the expectation of both sides:\n$$\nE[M_t] = E[\\sqrt{t} M_1] = \\sqrt{t} E[M_1]\n$$\nWe can find $E[M_1]$ from our previous general calculation by setting $t=1$:\n$$\nE[M_1] = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(1)}{\\pi}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}}\n$$\nSubstituting this value back, we get:\n$$\nE[M_t] = \\sqrt{t} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2t}{\\pi}}\n$$\nThis confirms our direct calculation and demonstrates the utility of the scaling property.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{2t}{\\pi}}}$$", "id": "3049950"}, {"introduction": "Brownian motion exhibits a remarkable self-similarity across different time scales, a property known as Brownian scaling.

It has covariance $\\mathbb{E}[B_s B_t] = \\min\\{s, t\\}$ for all $s, t \\geq 0$.\n\nWe are given a constant $c > 0$.

Since $B_0 = 0$, it follows that $X_0 = 0$.\n\n2.  **Continuity of paths:** The mapping $s \\mapsto cs$ is a continuous function. The process $\\{B_t\\}$ has continuous sample paths, meaning $u \\mapsto B_u$ is continuous. The composition of continuous functions is continuous, so $s \\mapsto B_{cs}$ is continuous. Scaling by the constant $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}}$ preserves continuity. Therefore, the sample paths of $\\{X_s\\}$ are continuous.\n\n3.  **Gaussian process and mean:** Since $\\{B_t\\}$ is a Gaussian process, any finite linear combination of its random variables is normally distributed. For any set of times $s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_n$, the vector $(X_{s_1}, \\dots, X_{s_n}) = (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}} B_{cs_1}, \\dots, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}} B_{cs_n})$ is a linear transformation of the Gaussian vector $(B_{cs_1}, \\dots, B_{cs_n})$, and is therefore also a Gaussian vector. This establishes that $\\{X_s\\}$ is a Gaussian process.\nThe mean of $X_s$ is:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X_s] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}} B_{cs}\\right] = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}} \\mathbb{E}[B_{cs}] $$\nSince $\\mathbb{E}[B_t] = 0$ for all $t$, we have $\\mathbb{E}[B_{cs}] = 0$. Thus, $\\mathbb{E}[X_s] = 0$ for all $s \\geq 0$.\n\n4.  **Covariance structure:** We compute the covariance of $X_s$ and $X_u$ for any $s, u \\geq 0$.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X_s X_u] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}} B_{cs}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}} B_{cu}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{1}{c} \\mathbb{E}[B_{cs} B_{cu}] $$\nUsing the covariance property of SBM, $\\mathbb{E}[B_a B_b] = \\min\\{a, b\\}$, we have:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[B_{cs} B_{cu}] = \\min\\{cs, cu\\} $$\nSince $c > 0$, we can factor it out of the minimum operator: $\\min\\{cs, cu\\} = c \\min\\{s, u\\}$.\nSubstituting this back into the covariance calculation for $X$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X_s X_u] = \\frac{1}{c} (c \\min\\{s, u\\}) = \\min\\{s, u\\} $$\nThis is precisely the covariance structure of a standard Brownian motion.\n\nSince the process $\\{X_s\\}_{s \\geq 0}$ satisfies all four defining properties of a standard Brownian motion, it has the same probability law as the process $\\{B_s\\}_{s \\geq 0}$.

Let $u = cs$. As $s$ varies from $0$ to $t$, the variable $u$ varies from $0$ to $ct$. The expression becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}} \\sup_{0 \\leq u \\leq ct} B_u $$\nBy definition, $\\sup_{0 \\leq u \\leq ct} B_u = M_{ct}$. Therefore, we have established:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}} M_{ct} \\stackrel{d}{=} M_t $$\nMultiplying by $\\sqrt{c}$ (which is a deterministic, positive constant), we arrive at the desired scaling relationship:\n$$ M_{ct} \\stackrel{d}{=} \\sqrt{c} M_t $$\nThis completes the proof for part (a).\n\n(b) Relating the PDFs of $M_{c t}$ and $M_t$.\n\nFrom part (a), we have the distributional equality $M_{ct} \\stackrel{d}{=} \\sqrt{c} M_t$.

We need to find the PDF of $Y$, $f_Y(m)$, in terms of the PDF of $X$, $f_X(m)$. The problem asks us to use first principles.\n\nWe begin with the cumulative distribution function (CDF). Let $F_Y(m)$ be the CDF of $Y$ and $F_X(m)$ be the CDF of $X$.\n$$ F_Y(m) = P(Y \\leq m) $$\nDue to the equality in distribution, $P(Y \\leq m) = P(aX \\leq m)$.\nSince $a = \\sqrt{c} > 0$, we can divide the inequality by $a$ without changing its direction:\n$$ P(aX \\leq m) = P\\left(X \\leq \\frac{m}{a}\\right) $$\nThe right-hand side is, by definition, the CDF of $X$ evaluated at the point $\\frac{m}{a}$:\n$$ F_Y(m) = F_X\\left(\\frac{m}{a}\\right) $$\nThe probability density function (PDF) is the derivative of the CDF with respect to its argument. So, $f_Y(m) = \\frac{d}{dm} F_Y(m)$. Applying this to our relationship:\n$$ f_Y(m) = \\frac{d}{dm} F_X\\left(\\frac{m}{a}\\right) $$\nUsing the chain rule for differentiation, with $u = \\frac{m}{a}$ so that $\\frac{du}{dm} = \\frac{1}{a}$:\n$$ f_Y(m) = \\frac{dF_X(u)}{du} \\cdot \\frac{du}{dm} = f_X(u) \\cdot \\frac{1}{a} $$\nSubstituting $u = \\frac{m}{a}$ back into the expression:\n$$ f_Y(m) = \\frac{1}{a} f_X\\left(\\frac{m}{a}\\right) $$\nFinally, we replace $Y$, $X$, and $a$ with their definitions in the context of the problem: $Y=M_{ct}$, $X=M_t$, and $a=\\sqrt{c}$. The PDFs are denoted $f_{M_{ct}}(m)$ and $f_{M_t}(m)$.\nThis yields the relationship between the two PDFs:\n$$ f_{M_{ct}}(m) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}} f_{M_t}\\left(\\frac{m}{\\sqrt{c}}\\right) $$\nThis expression gives the PDF of the maximum at time $ct$ in terms of the PDF of the maximum at time $t$.

The event $\\{M_t \\geq a\\}$ means that the Brownian path has reached or exceeded the level $a$ at some time $s \\in [0, t]$.\n\nWe can partition the sample space based on the value of $B_t$. By the law of total probability, we can write:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(M_t \\geq a) = \\mathbb{P}(M_t \\geq a \\text{ and } B_t \\geq a) + \\mathbb{P}(M_t \\geq a \\text{ and } B_t  a)\n$$\nLet's analyze the first term. If the process is at or above level $a$ at time $t$, i.e., $B_t \\geq a$, then its maximum over the interval $[0, t]$ must also be at or above $a$, i.e., $M_t \\geq B_t$. This is because $M_t = \\sup_{0 \\leq s \\leq t} B_s \\geq B_t$. Therefore, the event $\\{B_t \\geq a\\}$ is a subset of the event $\\{M_t \\geq a\\}$. This implies that the intersection of these two events is simply the event $\\{B_t \\geq a\\}$ itself. So,\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(M_t \\geq a \\text{ and } B_t \\geq a) = \\mathbb{P}(B_t \\geq a)\n$$\nNow we analyze the second term, $\\mathbb{P}(M_t \\geq a \\text{ and } B_t  a)$. This is the probability that the path reaches or exceeds level $a$ at some point but ends up below $a$ at time $t$. For this to happen, the path must have crossed level $a$ at some time $\\tau_a \\leq t$. This is where the reflection principle for Brownian motion is applied.\n\nThe reflection principle states that for any $a > 0$, the probability of a path starting at $0$ reaching level $a$ before time $t$ and ending at $B_t  a$ is equal to the probability of a path starting at $0$ and ending at $B_t > a$. To see this, consider a path $\\omega$ for which $M_t(\\omega) \\geq a$ and $B_t(\\omega)  a$. Let $\\tau_a(\\omega)$ be the first time this path hits $a$. We define a new path $\\tilde{\\omega}$ by reflecting the original path after time $\\tau_a(\\omega)$:\n$$\n\\tilde{B}_s(\\omega) = \\begin{cases} B_s(\\omega)  \\text{if } s \\leq \\tau_a(\\omega) \\\\ a - (B_s(\\omega) - a) = 2a - B_s(\\omega)  \\text{if } s > \\tau_a(\\omega) \\end{cases}\n$$\nBy construction, since $B_t(\\omega)  a$, the reflected path's value at time $t$ is $\\tilde{B}_t(\\omega) = 2a - B_t(\\omega) > 2a - a = a$. The map from $\\omega$ to $\\tilde{\\omega}$ is a bijection between the set of paths where $\\{M_t \\geq a, B_t  a\\}$ and the set of paths where $\\{B_t > a\\}$. The strong Markov property of Brownian motion and the symmetry of its increments imply that this map preserves probabilities. Therefore,\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(M_t \\geq a \\text{ and } B_t  a) = \\mathbb{P}(B_t > a)\n$$\nSince $B_t$ follows a normal distribution, which is continuous, the probability of it being exactly equal to any value is $0$. Thus, $\\mathbb{P}(B_t > a) = \\mathbb{P}(B_t \\geq a)$.\n\nSubstituting these results back into our original equation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(M_t \\geq a) = \\mathbb{P}(B_t \\geq a) + \\mathbb{P}(B_t > a) = \\mathbb{P}(B_t \\geq a) + \\mathbb{P}(B_t \\geq a)\n$$\nThis yields the fundamental relationship:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(M_t \\geq a) = 2 \\, \\mathbb{P}(B_t \\geq a)\n$$\n\n### Part 2: CDF and PDF of the First Hitting Time $\\tau_a$\n\nThe cumulative distribution function (CDF) of $\\tau_a$ is defined as $F_{\\tau_a}(t) = \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\leq t)$. The event that the first hitting time $\\tau_a$ is less than or equal to $t$ is equivalent to the event that the running maximum $M_t$ is greater than or equal to $a$. This is because $B_0=0$ and the paths of a Brownian motion are continuous. If $M_t \\geq a$, the path must have visited $a$ at or before time $t$. Conversely, if $\\tau_a \\leq t$, then $B_{\\tau_a} = a$, so $M_t \\geq a$. Thus, $\\{\\tau_a \\leq t\\} = \\{M_t \\geq a\\}$.\n\nUsing the result from Part 1, we can write the CDF of $\\tau_a$ as:\n$$\nF_{\\tau_a}(t) = \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\leq t) = \\mathbb{P}(M_t \\geq a) = 2 \\, \\mathbb{P}(B_t \\geq a)\n$$\nA standard Brownian motion $B_t$ at a fixed time $t$ is a normally distributed random variable with mean $0$ and variance $t$, i.e., $B_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t)$. We can express this in terms of a standard normal variable $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ as $B_t = \\sqrt{t} Z$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(B_t \\geq a) = \\mathbb{P}(\\sqrt{t} Z \\geq a) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(Z \\geq \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{t}}\\right)\n$$\nThe probability $\\mathbb{P}(Z \\geq z)$ can be written as an integral of the standard normal PDF, $\\phi(u) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{u^2}{2}\\right)$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}\\left(Z \\geq \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{t}}\\right) = \\int_{a/\\sqrt{t}}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u^2}{2}\\right) du\n$$\nSo, the CDF of $\\tau_a$ is:\n$$\nF_{\\tau_a}(t) = 2 \\int_{a/\\sqrt{t}}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u^2}{2}\\right) du\n$$\nTo find the probability density function (PDF), $f_{\\tau_a}(t)$, we differentiate the CDF with respect to $t$. Using the Leibniz integral rule ($\\frac{d}{dx} \\int_{g(x)}^{h(x)} f(u) du = f(h(x))h'(x) - f(g(x))g'(x)$), we have:\n$$\nf_{\\tau_a}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} F_{\\tau_a}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( 2 \\int_{a/\\sqrt{t}}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u^2}{2}\\right) du \\right)\n$$\nThe upper limit is a constant, so its derivative is $0$. The lower limit is $g(t) = a t^{-1/2}$, and its derivative is $g'(t) = a(-\\frac{1}{2})t^{-3/2} = -\\frac{a}{2t^{3/2}}$.\n$$\nf_{\\tau_a}(t) = 2 \\left( 0 - \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{t}}\\right)^2\\right) \\right] \\cdot \\left( -\\frac{a}{2t^{3/2}} \\right) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nf_{\\tau_a}(t) = 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{a^2}{2t}\\right) \\frac{a}{2t^{3/2}} \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the PDF of the first hitting time $\\tau_a$:\n$$\nf_{\\tau_a}(t) = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2\\pi} t^{3/2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{a^2}{2t}\\right) \\quad \\text{for } t > 0\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Expectation of the First Hitting Time $\\mathbb{E}[\\tau_a]$\n\nThe expectation of $\\tau_a$ is given by the integral of $t$ times its PDF over its support $(0, \\infty)$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\tau_a] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t \\, f_{\\tau_a}(t) \\, dt\n$$\nSubstituting the derived PDF:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\tau_a] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t \\left( \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2\\pi} t^{3/2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{a^2}{2t}\\right) \\right) dt\n$$\nWe can simplify the integrand:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\tau_a] = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t \\cdot t^{-3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{a^2}{2t}\\right) dt = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^{-1/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{a^2}{2t}\\right) dt\n$$\nWe must now evaluate this improper integral and determine if it converges. The integral must be analyzed at its limits $t \\to 0^+$ and $t \\to \\infty$.\n\n1.  Behavior as $t \\to 0^+$: Let $y = 1/t$. As $t \\to 0^+$, $y \\to \\infty$. The integrand becomes $y^{1/2} \\exp(-a^2 y/2)$. Using L'Hôpital's rule multiple times shows that $\\lim_{y\\to\\infty} y^{1/2} \\exp(-a^2 y/2) = 0$. The integrand approaches $0$ at the lower limit of integration, so the integral converges on any interval of the form $[0, K]$ for finite $K > 0$.\n\n2.  Behavior as $t \\to \\infty$: As $t \\to \\infty$, the term $a^2/(2t) \\to 0$, and therefore $\\exp(-a^2/(2t)) \\to \\exp(0) = 1$.\n    For large $t$, the integrand behaves asymptotically like $t^{-1/2}$:\n    $$\n    t^{-1/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{a^2}{2t}\\right) \\sim t^{-1/2} \\quad \\text{as } t \\to \\infty\n    $$\n    We can use the limit comparison test for improper integrals. Consider the integral $\\int_{1}^{\\infty} t^{-p} dt$. This integral converges if and only if $p > 1$. In our case, the power is $p = 1/2$. Since $p = 1/2 \\leq 1$, the integral $\\int_{1}^{\\infty} t^{-1/2} dt$ diverges.\n    Formally, let $g(t) = t^{-1/2} \\exp(-a^2/(2t))$ and $h(t) = t^{-1/2}$.\n    $$\n    \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{g(t)}{h(t)} = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{t^{-1/2} \\exp(-a^2/(2t))}{t^{-1/2}} = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{a^2}{2t}\\right) = 1\n    $$\n    Since this limit is a finite positive number and the integral $\\int_{1}^{\\infty} h(t) dt = \\int_{1}^{\\infty} t^{-1/2} dt$ diverges, the integral $\\int_{1}^{\\infty} g(t) dt$ must also diverge. The integral for the expectation can be split as $\\int_{0}^{1} g(t) dt + \\int_{1}^{\\infty} g(t) dt$. The first part is finite, but the second part diverges to infinity.\n\nTherefore, the integral for $\\mathbb{E}[\\tau_a]$ diverges to $+\\infty$.\n\nConclusion: The expected time for a standard Brownian motion to first hit any level $a > 0$ is infinite.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\tau_a] = \\infty\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\infty}$$", "id": "3049951"}]}
