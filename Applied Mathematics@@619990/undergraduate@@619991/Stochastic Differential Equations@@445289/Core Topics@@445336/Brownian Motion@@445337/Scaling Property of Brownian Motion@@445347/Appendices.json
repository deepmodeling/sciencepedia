We are asked to evaluate the expectation $\\mathbb{E}[|W_{t+h}-W_{t}|^{q}]$ for $t \\geq 0$, $h>0$, and a fixed constant $q>0$.\n\nAccording to the defining properties provided, for any $0 \\leq s < t'$, the increment $W_{t'}-W_{s}$ is a Gaussian random variable with mean $0$ and variance $t'-s$. This is written as $W_{t'}-W_{s} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t'-s)$.\nIn our specific case, we are interested in the increment over the time interval $[t, t+h]$. We set $s=t$ and $t'=t+h$. The duration is $(t+h)-t=h$. Therefore, the increment $W_{t+h}-W_{t}$ follows a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $h$:\n$$\nW_{t+h}-W_{t} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, h)\n$$\nA general normal random variable $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ can be expressed in terms of a standard normal random variable $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ as $X = \\mu + \\sigma Z$. In our case, the mean is $\\mu=0$ and the variance is $\\sigma^2=h$, which implies the standard deviation is $\\sigma = \\sqrt{h}$ (since $h>0$).\nThus, we can write the Brownian increment as:\n$$\nW_{t+h}-W_{t} = \\sqrt{h} Z, \\quad \\text{where } Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\n$$\nThis representation allows us to compute the desired expectation.

Since the distribution of $Z$ is fixed, this expectation is a constant that depends only on the parameter $q$. Let us define this constant as $C_{q}$:\n$$\nC_{q} := \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\,|Z|^{q}\\,\\right]\n$$\nWith this definition, we have established the required relationship:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\,|W_{t+h}-W_{t}|^{q}\\,\\right] = C_{q} h^{q/2}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem. This result is a manifestation of the self-similarity or scaling property of Brownian motion, as the distribution of $W_{ch}$ is the same as that of $\\sqrt{c}W_h$.\n\nNext, we must determine the explicit form of $C_q$ in terms of the Gamma function.
