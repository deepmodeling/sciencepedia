We may, therefore, proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part solution: a theoretical derivation followed by an algorithmic implementation.\n\n### Task 1: Derivation of the Scaling Rule\n\nThe objective is to devise a method for generating discrete-time increments of a Brownian motion, $\\{\\Delta W_k\\}_{k=0}^{N-1}$, from a sequence of independent, standard normal random variables, $\\{Z_k\\}_{k=0}^{N-1}$. Each $Z_k$ is drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean $0$ and variance $1$, denoted as $Z_k \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. The time axis is discretized into uniform intervals of duration $\\Delta t$.\n\nThe increment $\\Delta W_k$ represents the change in the Brownian motion over the $k$-th time interval, i.e., $\\Delta W_k = W_{(k+1)\\Delta t} - W_{k\\Delta t}$. According to the foundational properties of a standard Brownian motion $\\{W_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$, for any two time points $s < t$, the increment $W_t - W_s$ is a normally distributed random variable with mean $0$ and variance $t-s$.\nApplying this property to our discrete interval of length $\\Delta t$, we set $s = k\\Delta t$ and $t = (k+1)\\Delta t$. The duration is $t-s = \\Delta t$. Therefore, the target distribution for each increment $\\Delta W_k$ must be a Gaussian distribution with mean $0$ and variance $\\Delta t$:\n$$\n\\Delta W_k \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\Delta t).\n$$\nWe propose a linear transformation to generate these increments from the standard normal variables $Z_k$:\n$$\n\\Delta W_k = \\alpha(\\Delta t) Z_k,\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha(\\Delta t)$ is a deterministic scaling function dependent only on the time step $\\Delta t$. Our task is to determine this function $\\alpha(\\Delta t)$.\n\nWe analyze the statistical properties of our proposed construction using standard properties of expectation and variance.\nThe expectation of the constructed increment is:\n$$\nE[\\Delta W_k] = E[\\alpha(\\Delta t) Z_k] = \\alpha(\\Delta t) E[Z_k].\n$$\nSince $E[Z_k] = 0$, we have $E[\\Delta W_k] = 0$. This correctly matches the zero-mean property of Brownian increments.\n\nThe variance of the constructed increment is found using the scaling property of variance, $\\text{Var}(aX) = a^2 \\text{Var}(X)$, where $a$ is a constant. Here, $a = \\alpha(\\Delta t)$.\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\Delta W_k) = \\text{Var}(\\alpha(\\Delta t) Z_k) = (\\alpha(\\Delta t))^2 \\text{Var}(Z_k).\n$$\nSince $Z_k$ is a standard normal variable, its variance is $\\text{Var}(Z_k) = 1$. This simplifies the expression for the variance of our constructed increment to:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\Delta W_k) = (\\alpha(\\Delta t))^2.\n$$\nTo ensure our construction is valid, its variance must match the target variance of a true Brownian increment, which is $\\Delta t$. Equating the two variances yields the equation for $\\alpha(\\Delta t)$:\n$$\n(\\alpha(\\Delta t))^2 = \\Delta t.\n$$\nSolving for $\\alpha(\\Delta t)$, we take the positive square root by convention:\n$$\n\\alpha(\\Delta t) = \\sqrt{\\Delta t}.\n$$\nTherefore, the correct scaling rule to generate Brownian increments is:\n$$\n\\Delta W_k = \\sqrt{\\Delta t} \\, Z_k.\n$$\nThis construction guarantees that each $\\Delta W_k$ is a random variable drawn from $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\Delta t)$. Furthermore, since the input variables $\\{Z_k\\}$ are independent, the resulting increments $\\{\\Delta W_k\\}$ are also independent, satisfying another core property of Brownian motion. This completes the derivation.\n\n### Task 2: Algorithmic Implementation and Statistical Analysis\n\nThe second task is to implement this generation scheme and compute three specified statistics for given sets of parameters. The parameters for each test case are the time step $\\Delta t$, the number of samples $N$, and a seed for the pseudo-random number generator to ensure reproducibility.\n\nThe steps for each test case are as follows:\n1.  Initialize a pseudo-random number generator with the specified seed. This ensures that the sequence of \"random\" numbers is deterministic and repeatable.\n2.  Generate a sequence of $N$ independent samples $\\{Z_k\\}_{k=0}^{N-1}$ from the standard normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$.\n3.  Calculate the scaling factor $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\Delta t}$.\n4.  Compute the sequence of Brownian increments $\\{\\Delta W_k\\}_{k=0}^{N-1}$ using the derived rule: $\\Delta W_k = \\sqrt{\\Delta t} \\, Z_k$.\n5.  Compute the sample mean $m$ of the sequence $\\{\\Delta W_k\\}$:\n    $$ m = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\Delta W_k. $$\n    The theoretical mean is $0$, so for large $N$, $m$ is expected to be close to $0$.\n6.  Compute the sample variance $v$ of the sequence $\\{\\Delta W_k\\}$ using $\\frac{1}{N}$ normalization:\n    $$ v = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\left(\\Delta W_k - m\\right)^2. $$\n    The theoretical variance is $\\Delta t$, so for large $N$, $v$ is expected to be close to $\\Delta t$.\n7.  Compute the lag-$1$ sample autocorrelation $r$. This first requires the calculation of the lag-$1$ autocovariance $c_1$:\n    $$ c_1 = \\frac{1}{N-1}\\sum_{k=0}^{N-2} \\left(\\Delta W_k - m\\right)\\left(\\Delta W_{k+1} - m\\right). $$\n    The autocorrelation $r$ is then the autocovariance normalized by the variance:\n    $$ r = \\frac{c_1}{v}. $$\n    Since the increments are constructed to be independent, their theoretical autocorrelation is $0$. For a finite sample size $N$, $r$ is expected to be a small value fluctuating around $0$.\n\nThe program will execute this procedure for each of the three test cases (A, B, and C) and compile the nine resulting floating-point numbers ($m_A, v_A, r_A, m_B, v_B, r_B, m_C, v_C, r_C$) into a single list, rounding each to six decimal places for the final output.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates discrete Brownian motion increments and computes their statistics\n    for a given set of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A: (delta_t, N, seed)\n        (1e-3, 100000, 12345),\n        # Case B: (delta_t, N, seed)\n        (1e-1, 200000, 67890),\n        # Case C: (delta_t, N, seed)\n        (2.0, 50000, 54321),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        delta_t, N, seed = case\n\n        # Task 3: Initialize the pseudo-random number generator for reproducibility.\n        rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)\n\n        # Generate a sequence of N independent standard normal random variables Z_k.\n        Zk = rng.standard_normal(size=N)\n\n        # Task 1: Apply the derived scaling rule to get Brownian increments.\n        # The scaling factor alpha is sqrt(delta_t).\n        alpha = np.sqrt(delta_t)\n        delta_W = alpha * Zk\n\n        # Task 2: Compute the required statistics.\n        # 1.
