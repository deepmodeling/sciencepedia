That is, we must have:\n    $$ [M]_t = t, \\quad \\text{for all } t \\ge 0, \\text{ almost surely.} $$\n    It is crucial to recognize that this is a **pathwise** condition. For almost every realization $\\omega$ of the underlying probability space, the function $t \\mapsto [M]_t(\\omega)$ must be identical to the function $t \\mapsto t$.\n\n2.  **Quadratic Variation and the Second Moment**: For a continuous square-integrable martingale $\\{M_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ with $M_0=0$, there is a fundamental identity connecting its second moment to its quadratic variation. The process $\\{M_t^2 - [M]_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ is a martingale. Since $M_0=0$ and $[M]_0=0$ by definition, we have:\n    $$ \\mathbb{E}[M_t^2 - [M]_t] = \\mathbb{E}[M_0^2 - [M]_0] = 0 $$\n    This directly implies:\n    $$ \\mathbb{E}[M_t^2] = \\mathbb{E}[[M]_t] $$\n    This result is a form of Itō's isometry.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Problem Condition**: The problem provides the condition $\\mathbb{E}[M_t^2] = t$. Applying the identity from step 2, we can conclude that:\n    $$ \\mathbb{E}[[M]_t] = t $$\n    This means that the *expected value* of the quadratic variation at time $t$ is equal to $t$.\n\n4.  **Comparison**: Lévy's characterization requires $[M]_t = t$ almost surely. The given condition only allows us to deduce that $\\mathbb{E}[[M]_t] = t$. The question thus reduces to whether knowing the expectation of a random variable is sufficient to determine the random variable itself.\n    For a non-negative random variable $X$, the condition $\\mathbb{E}[X] = c$ does not, in general, imply that $X=c$ almost surely. The equality holds if and only if the variance of $X$ is zero, i.e., $\\text{Var}(X) = 0$. In our case, for each fixed $t>0$, $[M]_t$ is a non-negative random variable. The condition $\\mathbb{E}[[M]_t] = t$ does not preclude $[M]_t$ from having a non-zero variance. It is possible for $[M]_t$ to be a random variable with mean $t$, but whose value for any specific sample path is not $t$.\n    \n    For $\\{M_t\\}$ to be a standard Brownian motion, we need $[M]_t$ to be the deterministic function $f(t)=t$. The given information only fixes the mean of the random process $[M]_t$, not the process itself. Therefore, the condition $\\mathbb{E}[M_t^2] = t$ is insufficient to conclude that $M$ is a standard Brownian motion.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The condition $\\mathbb{E}[M_t^2] = t$ implies $[M]_t = t$ almost surely, so by Lévy’s characterization $M$ is a standard Brownian motion.**\nThis statement is founded on a false premise. As demonstrated above, $\\mathbb{E}[M_t^2] = t$ implies $\\mathbb{E}[[M]_t] = t$, which does NOT imply $[M]_t = t$ almost surely. The expectation of a random variable does not determine its value.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The condition $\\mathbb{E}[M_t^2] = t$ ensures $\\mathbb{E}([M]_t) = t$ but does not force $[M]_t = t$ almost surely; Lévy’s characterization requires the stronger pathwise identity $[M]_t = t$.**\nThis statement is perfectly accurate. It correctly states that the given condition implies $\\mathbb{E}[[M]_t] = t$. It correctly identifies that this is not sufficient to conclude $[M]_t = t$ a.s., because the expectation does not determine the random variable. It also correctly states the precise pathwise requirement of Lévy's characterization. This is a complete and correct analysis of the situation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Since $\\mathbb{E}[M_t^2] = t$, the distribution of $M_t$ must be Gaussian with variance $t$, hence $M$ is Brownian by Lévy’s characterization.**\nThis statement contains two errors. First, knowing the second moment, $\\mathbb{E}[M_t^2] = t$, is not sufficient to determine the entire distribution of the random variable $M_t$. There exist infinitely many non-Gaussian distributions with the same second moment. Second, even if $M_t$ were known to be Gaussian for each $t$, this would not be sufficient to prove that the process $\\{M_t\\}$ is a Brownian motion. A Brownian motion is a Gaussian process, which is a much stronger condition concerning the joint distribution of $(M_{t_1}, M_{t_2}, \\dots, M_{t_n})$ for any collection of times.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Continuity, the martingale property, and $\\mathbb{E}[M_t^2] = t$ are sufficient for $M$ to be Brownian; the quadratic variation $[M]_t$ plays no role in Lévy’s characterization.**\nThis statement is incorrect. As established, the conditions are insufficient. Furthermore, the claim that \"[M]_t$ plays no role in Lévy’s characterization\" is a direct contradiction of the theorem itself. Lévy's characterization is precisely a statement *about* the quadratic variation of a continuous local martingale.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. If $[M]_t$ is deterministic, then $M$ is a time-change of Brownian motion; moreover $\\mathbb{E}[M_t^2]=t$ forces $[M]_t$ to equal $t$ deterministically, so $M$ is a standard Brownian motion.**\nThe first part of the statement is related to the Dambis-Dubins-Schwarz theorem and is correct: if $[M]_t = f(t)$ for a deterministic, continuous, strictly increasing function $f$, then $M$ is a time-changed Brownian motion. The second part, however, is fallacious. The condition $\\mathbb{E}[M_t^2]=t$ does not force $[M]_t$ to be deterministic. It only implies $\\mathbb{E}[[M]_t]=t$. The argument incorrectly assumes that $[M]_t$ is deterministic to conclude that it must be equal to $t$. The premise of the argument does not provide any grounds for assuming $[M]_t$ is deterministic.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "3063559"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theoretical distinctions to concrete calculations, we now test a process defined by an Itô integral.

The quadratic variation is then:\n$$[Y]_t = \\operatorname*{plim}_{n\\to\\infty} \\sum_{i=0}^{m_n-1} (Y_{t_{i+1}^n} - Y_{t_i^n})^2$$\nFor our process $X_t = B_{t^2}$, the sum is:\n$$V_n(t) := \\sum_{i=0}^{m_n-1} (X_{t_{i+1}^n} - X_{t_i^n})^2 = \\sum_{i=0}^{m_n-1} (B_{(t_{i+1}^n)^2} - B_{(t_i^n)^2})^2$$\nLet us define a new set of time points $s_i^n := (t_i^n)^2$. This new set, $S^n = \\{s_0^n, \\dots, s_{m_n}^n\\}$, forms a partition of the interval $[0, t^2]$.
