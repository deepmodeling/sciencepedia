All necessary components for a unique solution are provided. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nLet $\\{W_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ be a standard Brownian motion and $X_t$ be a scalar Itô process governed by the stochastic differential equation (SDE):\n$$\ndX_t = \\mu_t \\, dt + \\sigma_t \\, dW_t\n$$\nWe are asked to find the SDE for the process $Y_t = X_t^n$ for an integer $n \\ge 2$. Following the problem's instruction, we start by considering the differential $d(X_t^n)$ and expanding it using the binomial formula:\n$$\nd(X_t^n) = (X_t + dX_t)^n - X_t^n\n$$\nThe binomial expansion of $(X_t + dX_t)^n$ is given by:\n$$\n(X_t + dX_t)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} X_t^{n-k} (dX_t)^k\n$$\nwhere $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ is the binomial coefficient.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $d(X_t^n)$:\n$$\nd(X_t^n) = \\left( \\binom{n}{0}X_t^n (dX_t)^0 + \\binom{n}{1}X_t^{n-1} (dX_t)^1 + \\binom{n}{2}X_t^{n-2} (dX_t)^2 + \\sum_{k=3}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} X_t^{n-k} (dX_t)^k \\right) - X_t^n\n$$\nSince $\\binom{n}{0} = 1$ and $(dX_t)^0 = 1$, the first term is $X_t^n$. Thus, we have:\n$$\nd(X_t^n) = \\binom{n}{1}X_t^{n-1} dX_t + \\binom{n}{2}X_t^{n-2} (dX_t)^2 + \\sum_{k=3}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} X_t^{n-k} (dX_t)^k\n$$\nWe now analyze the powers of the stochastic differential $dX_t = \\mu_t \\, dt + \\sigma_t \\, dW_t$ using the provided multiplication rules: $dt^2 = 0$, $dt \\, dW_t = 0$, and $(dW_t)^2 = dt$. These rules are shorthands for the behavior of stochastic integrals and capture the quadratic variation of Brownian motion.\n\nFor the first-order term, $dX_t$:\n$$\ndX_t = \\mu_t \\, dt + \\sigma_t \\, dW_t\n$$\n\nFor the second-order term, $(dX_t)^2$:\n$$\n(dX_t)^2 = (\\mu_t \\, dt + \\sigma_t \\, dW_t)^2 = (\\mu_t \\, dt)^2 + 2\\mu_t\\sigma_t \\, dt \\, dW_t + (\\sigma_t \\, dW_t)^2\n$$\n$$\n(dX_t)^2 = \\mu_t^2 \\, (dt)^2 + 2\\mu_t\\sigma_t \\, (dt \\, dW_t) + \\sigma_t^2 \\, (dW_t)^2\n$$\nApplying the rules, we substitute $dt^2 = 0$, $dt \\, dW_t = 0$, and $(dW_t)^2 = dt$:\n$$\n(dX_t)^2 = \\mu_t^2 \\, (0) + 2\\mu_t\\sigma_t \\, (0) + \\sigma_t^2 \\, (dt) = \\sigma_t^2 \\, dt\n$$\nThis is a crucial result: the square of the stochastic differential $dX_t$ is not negligible but is a term of order $dt$. This is a direct consequence of the non-zero quadratic variation of Brownian motion.\n\nFor higher-order terms, $(dX_t)^k$ with $k \\ge 3$:\nLet's examine $(dX_t)^3$:\n$$\n(dX_t)^3 = (dX_t)^2 \\, dX_t = (\\sigma_t^2 \\, dt) (\\mu_t \\, dt + \\sigma_t \\, dW_t) = \\mu_t\\sigma_t^2 \\, dt^2 + \\sigma_t^3 \\, dt \\, dW_t\n$$\nApplying the rules again, we find:\n$$\n(dX_t)^3 = \\mu_t\\sigma_t^2 \\, (0) + \\sigma_t^3 \\, (0) = 0\n$$\nAll terms of order $dt^{3/2}$ or higher are considered negligible in this heuristic calculus. For any $k \\ge 3$, $(dX_t)^k$ will contain products of differentials like $(dt)^a (dW_t)^b$ where $a+b/2 > 1$. For instance, the lowest order part of $(dX_t)^k$ will be proportional to $(dW_t)^k$, which is of order $dt^{k/2}$. Since $k \\ge 3$, $k/2 > 1$, and these are negligible compared to terms of order $dt$ or $dW_t$ (order $dt^{1/2}$). Therefore, the summation for $k \\ge 3$ vanishes.\n\nSo, the expansion of $d(X_t^n)$ simplifies to:\n$$\nd(X_t^n) = \\binom{n}{1}X_t^{n-1} dX_t + \\binom{n}{2}X_t^{n-2} (dX_t)^2\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $dX_t$ and $(dX_t)^2$:\n$$\nd(X_t^n) = n X_t^{n-1} (\\mu_t \\, dt + \\sigma_t \\, dW_t) + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} X_t^{n-2} (\\sigma_t^2 \\, dt)\n$$\nWe can now group the terms by $dt$ (the drift) and $dW_t$ (the diffusion):\n$$\nd(X_t^n) = (n X_t^{n-1} \\mu_t + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} X_t^{n-2} \\sigma_t^2) \\, dt + n X_t^{n-1} \\sigma_t \\, dW_t\n$$\nThis is the SDE for $Y_t = X_t^n$. This result is a specific application of Itô's formula for the function $f(x)=x^n$.\n\nThe problem asks to explain why the differential $d(X_t^n)$ includes a drift term proportional to $X_t^{n-2} \\sigma_t^2 \\, dt$ for $n \\ge 2$. As the derivation shows, this term arises from the second-order term in the binomial (or Taylor) expansion of $(X_t+dX_t)^n$, which is $\\binom{n}{2}X_t^{n-2}(dX_t)^2$. In ordinary calculus, $(dx)^2$ is considered an infinitesimal of higher order and is neglected. However, in Itô's stochastic calculus, the quadratic variation of the process $X_t$ is non-zero due to its stochastic component. The term $(dX_t)^2$ is not negligible; it simplifies to $\\sigma_t^2 \\, dt$, a term of the same order as the standard drift differential $dt$. This additional drift component is known as the Itô correction term. For $n \\ge 2$, the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{2}$ is non-zero, ensuring the presence of this term.\n\nThe drift component of $d(X_t^n)$ is $(n X_t^{n-1} \\mu_t + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} X_t^{n-2} \\sigma_t^2) \\, dt$.

For any $t0$, this value is strictly positive. This stands in direct contradiction to the result $\\mathbb{E}[|W_t|] = 0$ obtained from the naive application of Itô's formula. This demonstrates that the naive approach is invalid. The discrepancy arises because the behavior of the function at the single point $x=0$ cannot be ignored. The correct generalization, known as the Itô-Tanaka formula, adds a drift term related to the local time of the process at zero, $L_t^0$, which accounts for the \"push\" the process receives when it hits the origin. The full formula is $d|W_t| = \\text{sgn}(W_t) dW_t + dL_t^0$, and taking expectations reveals $\\mathbb{E}[|W_t|]=\\mathbb{E}[L_t^0]$. Our calculation thus also computes the expected local time.\n\nThe problem asks for the exact value of $\\mathbb{E}[|W_t|]$. Based on our direct calculation, this value is $\\sqrt{\\frac{2t}{\\pi}}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{2t}{\\pi}}}$$", "id": "3060946"}]}
