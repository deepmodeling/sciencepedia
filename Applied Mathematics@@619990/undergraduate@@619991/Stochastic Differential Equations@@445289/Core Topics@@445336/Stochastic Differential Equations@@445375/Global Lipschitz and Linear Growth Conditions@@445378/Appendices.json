Specifically, if $\\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} |f'(x)| = L < \\infty$, then by the Mean Value Theorem, for any $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, there exists a $c$ between $x$ and $y$ such that $|f(x) - f(y)| = |f'(c)| |x-y|$. This implies $|f(x) - f(y)| \\leq L|x-y|$. The constant $L = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} |f'(x)|$ is the smallest possible Lipschitz constant for $f$.\n\n**Analysis of the drift coefficient $b(x) = \\sin(x)$:**\nThe drift coefficient is given by $b(x) = \\sin(x)$. This function is differentiable for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Its derivative is:\n$$\nb'(x) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\sin(x) = \\cos(x)\n$$\nTo find the smallest global Lipschitz constant $L_b$, we compute the supremum of the absolute value of the derivative over $\\mathbb{R}$:\n$$\nL_b = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} |b'(x)| = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} |\\cos(x)|\n$$\nThe function $|\\cos(x)|$ has a maximum value of $1$. For example, at $x=0$, $|\\cos(0)| = |1| = 1$. The range of $|\\cos(x)|$ is $[0, 1]$. Therefore, the supremum is $1$.\n$$\nL_b = 1\n$$\nSince the derivative is bounded, $b(x) = \\sin(x)$ satisfies a global Lipschitz condition, and the smallest such constant is $L_b = 1$.\n\n**Analysis of the diffusion coefficient $\\sigma(x) = \\cos(x)$:**\nThe diffusion coefficient is given by $\\sigma(x) = \\cos(x)$. This function is also differentiable for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Its derivative is:\n$$\n\\sigma'(x) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\cos(x) = -\\sin(x)\n$$\nTo find the smallest global Lipschitz constant $L_\\sigma$, we compute the supremum of the absolute value of the derivative over $\\mathbb{R}$:\n$$\nL_\\sigma = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} |\\sigma'(x)| = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} |-\\sin(x)| = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} |\\sin(x)|\n$$\nThe function $|\\sin(x)|$ has a maximum value of $1$. For example, at $x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, $|\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2})| = |1| = 1$. The range of $|\\sin(x)|$ is $[0, 1]$.

To find the smallest possible constant $K$, we can rearrange the inequality to solve for $K^2$:\n$$\nK^2 \\geq \\frac{1}{1 + |x|^2}\n$$\nSince this must be true for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $K^2$ must be greater than or equal to the maximum value of the expression on the right-hand side. Let's find the supremum of the function $g(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + x^2}$ over $\\mathbb{R}$.\nThe denominator $1 + x^2$ is always greater than or equal to $1$, with its minimum value occurring at $x=0$.\n$$\n\\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}}(1+x^2) = 1 + 0^2 = 1\n$$\nConsequently, the function $g(x)$ achieves its maximum value at $x=0$:\n$$\n\\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} g(x) = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} \\frac{1}{1 + x^2} = \\frac{1}{\\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}}(1+x^2)} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1\n$$\nTherefore, the condition on $K^2$ becomes:\n$$\nK^2 \\geq 1\n$$\nSince the problem defines $K \\geq 0$, the smallest possible value for $K$ is $\\sqrt{1} = 1$.

Therefore, **$b(x)$ satisfies the linear growth condition**.\n\n**Analysis of the Diffusion Coefficient: $\\sigma(x) = \\sigma \\sqrt{x^+}$**\n\n1.  **Global Lipschitz Condition for $\\sigma(x)$**:\n    We test the condition $|\\sigma(x) - \\sigma(y)| \\le L_\\sigma |x-y|$ for some constant $L_\\sigma > 0$.

Since $\\sigma(x)$ fails this condition, this theorem cannot be directly applied. However, this does not mean a solution fails to exist or is not unique. For one-dimensional SDEs, there are weaker conditions that suffice. The coefficient $\\sigma(x) = \\sigma\\sqrt{x^+}$ is globally $\\frac{1}{2}$-Hölder continuous. For a 1D SDE, a Lipschitz drift and a Hölder continuous diffusion are sufficient to guarantee the existence of a unique strong solution. The linear growth condition ensures this solution is global (does not explode in finite time). The Feller condition ($2\\kappa\\theta \\ge \\sigma^2$) is a well-known result from the study of the CIR process that determines the behavior of the process at the boundary $x=0$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.

Therefore, its supremum on the interval $(R, \\infty)$ is the limit as $u$ approaches $R$ from the right:\n$$\n\\sup_{|x| > R} \\frac{|b_R(x)|}{1+|x|} = \\lim_{u \\to R^+} g(u) = \\frac{R^3}{1+R}\n$$\n\nCombining both cases, the overall supremum is the maximum of the values found, which are identical.\n$$\nC(R) = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} \\frac{|b_R(x)|}{1+|x|} = \\frac{R^3}{1+R}\n$$\nThis verifies that $b_R$ satisfies a linear growth condition and provides the smallest constant.\n\n**Computation of the Global Lipschitz Constant $L(R)$**\n\nThe global Lipschitz condition requires $|b_R(x) - b_R(y)| \\le L(R)|x-y|$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The smallest such constant $L(R)$ is given by:\n$$\nL(R) = \\sup_{x \\neq y} \\frac{|b_R(x) - b_R(y)|}{|x-y|}\n$$\nWe use the structure of $b_R(x) = b(T_R(x))$. The problem notes that $T_R(x)$ is a projection onto a closed convex set in $\\mathbb{R}$, specifically the interval $[-R, R]$. A fundamental property of such projections is that they are non-expansive, which means they are Lipschitz continuous with a constant of $1$:\n$$\n|T_R(x) - T_R(y)| \\le |x-y| \\quad \\forall x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}\n$$\nNow consider the function $b(u) = u^3$. Its domain of application in $b_R$ is restricted to the range of $T_R$, which is the interval $[-R, R]$. On this interval, $b(u)$ is continuously differentiable, with derivative $b'(u) = 3u^2$.\nBy the Mean Value Theorem, for any two points $u, v \\in [-R, R]$, there exists a point $c$ between $u$ and $v$ such that:\n$$\n|b(u) - b(v)| = |b'(c)| |u-v|\n$$\nSince $u, v \\in [-R, R]$, it follows that $c \\in [-R, R]$. The Lipschitz constant of $b(u)$ on $[-R, R]$ is the supremum of $|b'(u)|$ over this interval:\n$$\nL_{b,R} = \\sup_{c \\in [-R, R]} |b'(c)| = \\sup_{c \\in [-R, R]} |3c^2| = 3R^2\n$$\nNow we can combine these facts. Let $u = T_R(x)$ and $v = T_R(y)$.\n\\begin{align*}\n|b_R(x) - b_R(y)| &= |b(T_R(x)) - b(T_R(y))| \\\\\n&\\le L_{b,R} |T_R(x) - T_R(y)| \\\\\n&\\le (3R^2) |x-y|\n\\end{align*}\nThis shows that $b_R$ is globally Lipschitz and that its Lipschitz constant $L(R)$ is at most $3R^2$.\n\nTo show that $3R^2$ is the smallest possible constant, we must demonstrate that this value is achieved or approached by the ratio $\\frac{|b_R(x) - b_R(y)|}{|x-y|}$. We can do this by considering points $x$ and $y$ within the interval $[-R, R]$, where $T_R$ is the identity map, i.e., $T_R(x) = x$.\nFor $x, y \\in [-R, R]$, we have $b_R(x) = x^3$ and $b_R(y) = y^3$. The ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{|x^3 - y^3|}{|x-y|} = |x^2 + xy + y^2|\n$$\nThe supremum of this expression for $x, y \\in [-R, R]$ gives the Lipschitz constant of $b_R$ on this interval. This supremum equals the supremum of the absolute value of the derivative, $|b_R'(x)| = |3x^2|$, on $(-R, R)$.\n$$\n\\sup_{x \\in (-R, R)} |3x^2| = 3R^2\n$$\nThe value $3R^2$ is approached as $x \\to R$ or $x \\to -R$. For example, consider $y=R$ and $x = R-\\epsilon$ for a small $\\epsilon > 0$.\n$$\n\\frac{|R^3 - (R-\\epsilon)^3|}{|R - (R-\\epsilon)|} = \\frac{3R^2\\epsilon - 3R\\epsilon^2 + \\epsilon^3}{\\epsilon} = 3R^2 - 3R\\epsilon + \\epsilon^2\n$$\nAs $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, this ratio approaches $3R^2$. Since the supremum of the ratio over all $x, y$ cannot be less than the supremum over a sub-domain, and we have an upper bound of $3R^2$ for the global case, we conclude that the smallest Lipschitz constant is exactly $3R^2$.\n$$\nL(R) = 3R^2\n$$\nThe pair of smallest constants is $(L(R), C(R))$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3R^{2} & \\frac{R^{3}}{1+R} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3057701"}]}
