The equation $\\mathrm{d}X_t = b(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t$ with a zero diffusion coefficient is an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE), specifically $X'(t) = b(X(t))$. The use of terminology from SDEs, such as \"strong solution\" and \"adapted process,\" is technically consistent. A deterministic solution $X_t$ is trivially adapted to any filtration, including that generated by a standard Brownian motion, as deterministic functions are measurable with respect to the trivial sigma-algebra $\\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\}$, which is a sub-sigma-algebra of any filtration. Thus, the problem is a well-posed ODE problem framed in the language of degenerate SDEs. The specific function $b(x) = 2\\sqrt{|x|}$ is a classic example used to illustrate the difference between the Peano existence theorem (which requires only continuity of $b$) and the Picard-LindelÃ¶f theorem (which requires local Lipschitz continuity for uniqueness). The problem is mathematically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The question asks about the existence and uniqueness of solutions, which is a standard and well-defined mathematical question. A definite answer can be derived.\n- **Objectivity, Completeness, and Consistency**: The problem is stated in precise, objective mathematical language. All necessary components (equation, initial condition, coefficient function) are provided. There are no internal contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe given SDE, $\\mathrm{d}X_t = b(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t$ with $b(x) = 2\\sqrt{|x|}$ and a zero diffusion term, is equivalent to the ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}X_t}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 2\\sqrt{|X_t|}, \\quad X_0 = 0.\n$$\nThe integral form is $X_t = \\int_0^t 2\\sqrt{|X_s|}\\,\\mathrm{d}s$. We are asked to analyze the properties of the drift $b$ and the existence and uniqueness of solutions.\n\n**1. Verification of Linear Growth**\nA function $b:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is said to have linear growth if there exists a constant $K > 0$ such that for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$:\n$$\n|b(x)| \\le K(1 + |x|).\n$$\nFor the given drift $b(x) = 2\\sqrt{|x|}$, we have $|b(x)| = 2\\sqrt{|x|}$. We need to show that $2\\sqrt{|x|} \\le K(1 + |x|)$ for some $K$.\nConsider the inequality $2\\sqrt{|x|} \\le 1 + |x|$. This can be rewritten as $0 \\le |x| - 2\\sqrt{|x|} + 1$, which is equivalent to $0 \\le (\\sqrt{|x|} - 1)^2$. This inequality is true for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nTherefore, we can choose $K=1$, and the linear growth condition is satisfied:\n$$\n|b(x)| = 2\\sqrt{|x|} \\le 1 + |x| = 1 \\cdot (1 + |x|).\n$$\n\n**2. Verification of Non-Local Lipschitz Continuity at the Origin**\nA function $b$ is locally Lipschitz at $x=0$ if there exist constants $L > 0$ and $\\delta > 0$ such that for all $y_1, y_2 \\in (-\\delta, \\delta)$, the inequality $|b(y_1) - b(y_2)| \\le L|y_1 - y_2|$ holds.\nLet us test this condition at the origin. We choose $y_2 = 0$ and $y_1 = x$ for some $x \\in (-\\delta, \\delta)$. The condition becomes:\n$$\n|b(x) - b(0)| \\le L|x - 0|.\n$$\nSince $b(x) = 2\\sqrt{|x|}$ and $b(0) = 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n2\\sqrt{|x|} \\le L|x|.\n$$\nFor $x \\neq 0$, we can divide by $\\sqrt{|x|}$ to get:\n$$\n2 \\le L\\sqrt{|x|}.\n$$\nThis inequality must hold for all $x$ in a neighborhood of $0$. However, for any chosen $L > 0$, we can find an $x$ such that $0  |x|  (2/L)^2$. For such an $x$, we have $\\sqrt{|x|}  2/L$, which implies $L\\sqrt{|x|}  2$. This contradicts the required inequality. Therefore, no such constant $L$ exists, and the function $b(x) = 2\\sqrt{|x|}$ is not locally Lipschitz at $x=0$.\n\n**3. Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions for $X_0=0$**\nThe standard theorem for existence and uniqueness of solutions to SDEs (or ODEs), which requires local Lipschitz continuity and linear growth of the coefficients, does not apply here because the local Lipschitz condition fails at $x=0$.\nHowever, the drift function $b(x) = 2\\sqrt{|x|}$ is continuous everywhere. For ODEs, the Peano existence theorem guarantees the existence of at least one local solution when the right-hand side function is continuous.\n\n**Existence:**\nLet's test the trivial solution $X_t \\equiv 0$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\n- Initial condition: $X_0 = 0$, which is satisfied.\n- Differential equation: $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}(0) = 0$. The right-hand side is $2\\sqrt{|X_t|} = 2\\sqrt{|0|} = 0$. Since $0=0$, the equation is satisfied for all $t$.\nThus, $X_t \\equiv 0$ is a valid solution. A solution exists.\n\n**Uniqueness:**\nTo check for uniqueness (pathwise uniqueness in the SDE context), we search for other possible solutions. Let's assume a solution exists such that $X_t > 0$ for $t > 0$. The ODE becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}X_t}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 2\\sqrt{X_t}.\n$$\nThis is a separable equation. For $X_t > 0$, we can write:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}X_t}{2\\sqrt{X_t}} = \\mathrm{d}t.\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from $0$ to $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{X_0}^{X_t} \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{u}}\\,\\mathrm{d}u = \\int_0^t \\mathrm{d}s.\n$$\nSince $X_0=0$, the integral on the left is improper, but we proceed formally:\n$$\n[\\sqrt{u}]_{0}^{X_t} = [s]_0^t \\implies \\sqrt{X_t} - \\sqrt{X_0} = t - 0.\n$$\nWith $X_0=0$, we get $\\sqrt{X_t} = t$, which implies $X_t = t^2$ for $t \\ge 0$.\nLet's verify if $X_t = t^2$ is indeed a solution:\n- Initial condition: $X_0 = 0^2 = 0$, which is satisfied.\n- Differential equation: $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}X_t}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}(t^2) = 2t$. The right-hand side is $2\\sqrt{|X_t|} = 2\\sqrt{|t^2|} = 2|t|$. For $t \\ge 0$, this is $2t$.\nSince $2t=2t$ for $t \\ge 0$, the equation is satisfied.\nThus, $X_t = t^2$ is another valid solution.\n\nSince we have found at least two distinct solutions, $X_t \\equiv 0$ and $X_t = t^2$, that both satisfy the initial condition $X_0 = 0$, the solution is not unique. Pathwise uniqueness fails. In fact, one can construct an infinite family of solutions of the form $X_t = (t-c)^2$ for $t \\ge c$ and $X_t = 0$ for $t  c$, where $c \\ge 0$ is any non-negative constant.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation:**\n- At least one strong solution exists.\n- Pathwise uniqueness fails for the initial condition $X_0=0$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. There exists at least one strong solution and pathwise uniqueness fails for $X_0=0$.**\n    This statement aligns perfectly with our derivation. We explicitly found two solutions, $X_t \\equiv 0$ and $X_t = t^2$, demonstrating both existence and failure of uniqueness. This statement is **Correct**.\n\n*   **B. No strong solution exists for $X_0=0$ because $b$ is not locally Lipschitz.**\n    This statement is incorrect. The first part, \"No strong solution exists,\" is false, as we found multiple solutions. The reasoning is also flawed; the failure of the local Lipschitz condition does not imply non-existence. It only implies that the standard uniqueness theorem cannot be applied. The Peano existence theorem still guarantees a solution because $b$ is continuous. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. There is a unique strong solution for $X_0=0$ because $b$ has linear growth.**\n    This statement is incorrect. The premise, \"There is a unique strong solution,\" is false, as demonstrated by the existence of at least two solutions. The reasoning is also flawed; linear growth of the drift is not sufficient to guarantee uniqueness. It is typically combined with a Lipschitz condition to prove both existence and uniqueness. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. The only strong solution for $X_0=0$ is $X_t \\equiv 0$ for all $t\\ge 0$.**\n    This statement claims uniqueness of the trivial solution.

However, the diffusion term is constant and, critically, non-zero. This is a case of non-degenerate diffusion, as $\\sigma(x)^2 = \\sigma^2 > 0$ for all $x$, including $x=0$.\n\nA fundamental result in the theory of SDEs, often referred to as \"regularization by noise,\" states that a non-degenerate diffusion term can restore uniqueness even when the drift is not Lipschitz. More formally, theorems by Zvonkin and Veretennikov establish that for a one-dimensional SDE with a bounded, measurable drift and a uniformly elliptic and sufficiently regular diffusion coefficient, a unique strong solution exists. While the drift $b(x)=\\sqrt{|x|}$ is not bounded, it exhibits sub-linear growth, and local versions of these theorems apply. The crucial feature is that the noise term $\\sigma \\mathrm{d}W_t$ with $\\sigma > 0$ almost surely prevents the solution path from spending any positive amount of time at the single point $x=0$. Since the non-uniqueness of the ODE arises from solutions being able to \"rest\" at the singularity at $x=0$, the noise, by \"kicking\" the process away from the origin, resolves the issue.\n\nTherefore, for the SDE $\\mathrm{d}X_t=\\sqrt{|X_t|}\\,\\mathrm{d}t+\\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$ with $\\sigma0$, pathwise uniqueness holds.

The question of uniqueness now depends on how quickly the diffusion vanishes as $y \\to 0$, in competition with the singularity of the drift.\n\nA widely used criterion, related to the work of Engelbert  Schmidt and Yamada  Watanabe, inspects the integrability of $\\sigma(x)^{-2}$ near the singularity. For the zero-drift SDE $\\mathrm{d}Z_t = \\sigma(Z_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$, pathwise uniqueness from $0$ holds if and only if $\\int_{0+}^\\epsilon \\sigma(x)^{-2} \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\infty$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$.

Thus, we require:\n$$\n0 \\leq A + 2 - \\sigma^2 \\quad \\implies \\quad A \\geq \\sigma^2 - 2\n$$\nWe also require $A \\geq 0$. A valid choice for $A$ that satisfies both conditions is $A = \\max(0, \\sigma^2 - 2)$. For simplicity, a larger value also works. For example, let us choose $A = \\sigma^2$. Since $\\sigma \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $\\sigma^2 \\geq 0$, so this choice is valid. We check if it satisfies $A \\geq \\sigma^2 - 2$: indeed, $\\sigma^2 \\geq \\sigma^2 - 2$ is equivalent to $0 \\geq -2$, which is true.\nTherefore, with $V(x) = 1 + x^2$, we have found constants $A=\\sigma^2 \\geq 0$ and $B=2 \\geq 0$ such that $\\mathcal{L}V(x) \\leq A + B V(x)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFinally, we use this result to conclude that the solution is non-explosive. Let $\\tau_n = \\inf\\{t \\geq 0 : |X_t| \\geq n\\}$ be the first exit time from the interval $(-n, n)$, and let $\\tau_e = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\tau_n$ be the explosion time. By Dynkin's formula, for any $t \\geq 0$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[V(X_{t \\wedge \\tau_n})] = V(x_0) + \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^{t \\wedge \\tau_n} \\mathcal{L}V(X_s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s\\right]\n$$\nUsing the Lyapunov bound we derived, $\\mathcal{L}V(x) \\leq A + BV(x)$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[V(X_{t \\wedge \\tau_n})] \\leq V(x_0) + \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^{t \\wedge \\tau_n} (A + BV(X_s))\\,\\mathrm{d}s\\right] \\leq V(x_0) + At + B\\int_0^t \\mathbb{E}[V(X_{s \\wedge \\tau_n})]\\,\\mathrm{d}s\n$$\nLet $f(t) = \\mathbb{E}[V(X_{t \\wedge \\tau_n})]$. The inequality is $f(t) \\leq V(x_0) + At + B\\int_0^t f(s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s$. By GrÃ¶nwall's inequality, this implies that for any fixed $t > 0$, $f(t)$ is bounded by a constant $C(t, x_0, A, B)$ that depends on $t$ and the initial condition $x_0$, but not on $n$. Specifically, $f(t) \\leq (V(x_0) + A/B)\\exp(Bt) - A/B$.\n\nOn the other hand, we can obtain a lower bound for the expectation. On the event $\\{\\tau_n \\leq t\\}$, we have $|X_{\\tau_n}| \\geq n$, so $V(X_{\\tau_n}) = 1 + X_{\\tau_n}^2 \\geq 1 + n^2$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[V(X_{t \\wedge \\tau_n})] \\geq \\mathbb{E}[V(X_{t \\wedge \\tau_n}) \\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\tau_n \\leq t\\}}] = \\mathbb{E}[V(X_{\\tau_n}) \\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\tau_n \\leq t\\}}] \\geq (1+n^2)\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_n \\leq t)\n$$\nCombining the upper and lower bounds:\n$$\n(1+n^2)\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_n \\leq t) \\leq \\mathbb{E}[V(X_{t \\wedge \\tau_n})] \\leq C(t, x_0, A, B)\n$$\nRearranging for the probability gives:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_n \\leq t) \\leq \\frac{C(t, x_0, A, B)}{1+n^2}\n$$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, the right-hand side goes to $0$ for any fixed $t$, so $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_n \\leq t) = 0$.\nThe explosion time is $\\tau_e = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\tau_n$ (an increasing limit). The probability of explosion before time $t$ is $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_e \\leq t) = \\mathbb{P}(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\tau_n \\leq t)$. By continuity of probability from below (or by considering the complement event), this is equal to $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_n \\leq t) = 0$.\nSince this holds for any $t > 0$, the probability of explosion in finite time is zero: $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_e  \\infty) = 0$. Thus, $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_e = \\infty) = 1$, which confirms that the strong solution is non-explosive for any starting point $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe problem requires providing the explicit formula for the chosen function $V(x)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1+x^2}\n$$", "id": "3052211"}]}
