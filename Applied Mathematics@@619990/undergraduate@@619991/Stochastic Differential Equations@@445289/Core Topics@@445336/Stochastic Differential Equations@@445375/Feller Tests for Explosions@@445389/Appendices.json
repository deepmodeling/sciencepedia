We are to use the Feller test for explosions to classify the boundary points $0$ and $\\infty$ and determine the probability of explosion to $+\\infty$ in finite time, $\\mathbb{P}_{x_{0}}(\\tau_{\\infty}\\infty)$.\n\nFirst, we identify the drift and diffusion coefficients from the general form of an It√¥ diffusion, $\\mathrm{d}X_{t} = b(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}B_t$. For the given SDE, the drift coefficient is $b(x) = \\mu$ and the diffusion coefficient is $\\sigma(x) = 1$. Both are constants over the state space.\n\nThe Feller test for boundary classification relies on the scale function $s(x)$ and the speed measure density $m(x)$. These are determined by the coefficients $b(x)$ and $\\sigma(x)$.\n\nThe scale density, $s'(x)$, is defined up to a multiplicative constant and is given by\n$$\ns'(x) = \\exp\\left(-\\int \\frac{2b(x)}{\\sigma(x)^2} \\,\\mathrm{d}x\\right).\n$$\nSubstituting $b(x) = \\mu$ and $\\sigma(x) = 1$, we compute the integral in the exponent:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{2\\mu}{1^2} \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int 2\\mu \\,\\mathrm{d}x = 2\\mu x.\n$$\nChoosing the constant of integration to be zero for simplicity, we obtain the scale density:\n$$\ns'(x) = \\exp(-2\\mu x).\n$$\nThe scale function $s(x)$ can be defined by integrating $s'(x)$ from a reference point $c \\in (0, \\infty)$:\n$$\ns(x) = \\int_c^x s'(y)\\,\\mathrm{d}y = \\int_c^x \\exp(-2\\mu y)\\,\\mathrm{d}y = \\left[-\\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\exp(-2\\mu y)\\right]_c^x = \\frac{1}{2\\mu}(\\exp(-2\\mu c) - \\exp(-2\\mu x)).\n$$\nThe density of the speed measure, $m(x)$, is given by\n$$\nm(x) = \\frac{2}{s'(x)\\sigma(x)^2}.\n$$\nSubstituting our expressions for $s'(x)$ and $\\sigma(x)$:\n$$\nm(x) = \\frac{2}{\\exp(-2\\mu x) \\cdot 1^2} = 2\\exp(2\\mu x).\n$$\nWith the scale and speed densities, we can now classify the boundaries $0$ and $\\infty$ of the interval $(0, \\infty)$. We pick an arbitrary reference point $c \\in (0, \\infty)$, for instance $c=1$. The classification depends on the convergence or divergence of the following integrals.\n\nClassification of the boundary at $\\infty$:\nWe evaluate the integrals of $s'(x)$ and $m(x)$ from $c$ to $\\infty$.\n$$\n\\int_c^\\infty s'(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_c^\\infty \\exp(-2\\mu x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\left[-\\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\exp(-2\\mu x)\\right]_c^\\infty = 0 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\exp(-2\\mu c)\\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\exp(-2\\mu c).\n$$\nSince $\\mu  0$ and $c \\in (0, \\infty)$, this integral is finite.

An exit boundary is accessible from the interior but not enterable from the outside. Accessibility means the process can reach arbitrarily large values, but does not by itself guarantee it reaches the boundary at infinity *in finite time*.\n\nClassification of the boundary at $0$:\nWe evaluate the integrals of $s'(x)$ and $m(x)$ from $0$ to $c$.\n$$\n\\int_0^c s'(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_0^c \\exp(-2\\mu x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\left[-\\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\exp(-2\\mu x)\\right]_0^c = -\\frac{1}{2\\mu}(\\exp(-2\\mu c) - 1) = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-2\\mu c)}{2\\mu}.\n$$\nThis integral is finite.\nNext, we evaluate the integral of the speed density:\n$$\n\\int_0^c m(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_0^c 2\\exp(2\\mu x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\left[\\frac{1}{\\mu}\\exp(2\\mu x)\\right]_0^c = \\frac{1}{\\mu}(\\exp(2\\mu c) - 1).\n$$\nThis integral is also finite.\nSince both $\\int_0^c s'(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x  \\infty$ and $\\int_0^c m(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x  \\infty$, the boundary at $0$ is classified as a **regular** boundary. A regular boundary can be reached in finite time.\n\nThe question asks whether the process can explode to $+\\infty$ in finite time. A general Feller test for non-explosion to a boundary $r$ is to check if the integral of the expected time to reach it is infinite. Specifically, the process does not explode to infinity if the integral $I = \\int_c^\\infty m(x) (s(\\infty)-s(x))\\,\\mathrm{d}x$ diverges. Let's evaluate this. From our scale function, $s(\\infty) = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} s(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\exp(-2\\mu c)$, so $s(\\infty)-s(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\exp(-2\\mu x)$.\n$$\nI = \\int_c^\\infty 2\\exp(2\\mu x) \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\exp(-2\\mu x) \\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\int_c^\\infty 1\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\infty.\n$$\nSince this integral diverges, the Feller criterion for non-explosion is satisfied. The process does not reach $+\\infty$ in finite time.\n\nThis result is also intuitive. The SDE describes a Brownian motion with a constant positive drift $\\mu  0$. The path of the process $X_t = x_0 + \\mu t + B_t$ is continuous for all finite $t$. For any finite time $T  0$, $X_T = x_0 + \\mu T + B_T$ is a sum of finite quantities and thus is almost surely finite. Therefore, the process cannot reach $\\infty$ in finite time. The formal application of the Feller test confirms this.\n\nThis means that the explosion time $\\tau_\\infty$ is almost surely infinite.\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}_{x_{0}}(\\tau_{\\infty} = \\infty) = 1.\n$$\nConsequently, the probability of explosion to $+\\infty$ in finite time is zero.\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}_{x_{0}}(\\tau_{\\infty}  \\infty) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}_{x_{0}}(\\tau_{\\infty} = \\infty) = 0.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3053584"}, {"introduction": "Having mastered the case with constant coefficients, we now turn to a process where the drift depends on the state of the system.

So, the scale density is $s'(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2}$.\n\nNext, we compute the speed measure density $m(x)$, given by:\n$$\nm(x) = \\frac{2}{\\sigma^{2}(x)s'(x)}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\sigma(x)$ and $s'(x)$:\n$$\nm(x) = \\frac{2}{1^2 \\cdot x^{-2}} = 2x^2\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we must determine if the boundary point $0$ is accessible and compute the probability $p(x_0) = \\mathbb{P}_{x_0}(\\tau_0  \\infty)$, where $\\tau_0$ is the first hitting time of $0$.

Such a transformation does not alter the hitting probabilities. We can choose the constants to obtain the simplest form, which is equivalent to setting $c \\to \\infty$ or just taking the core functional part. Let's use the simple form:\n$$\ns(x) = -\\frac{1}{x}\n$$\nThe accessibility of a boundary and the probability of hitting it are determined by the behavior of the scale function at the boundary points. For a diffusion on an interval $(l, r)$, the probability of the process starting at $x_0 \\in (l, r)$ hitting the boundary $l$ before hitting the boundary $r$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}_{x_0}(\\tau_l  \\tau_r) = \\frac{s(r) - s(x_0)}{s(r) - s(l)}\n$$\nwhere $s(l) = \\lim_{x \\to l^+} s(x)$ and $s(r) = \\lim_{x \\to r^-} s(x)$.\nIn our case, the interval is $(0, \\infty)$, so we have $l=0$ and $r=\\infty$. The probability of hitting $0$ before 'escaping to infinity' is what we need to calculate for $p(x_0) = \\mathbb{P}_{x_0}(\\tau_0  \\infty)$. We compute the limits of our scale function at the boundaries:\n$$\ns(0) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} s(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\left(-\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = -\\infty\n$$\n$$\ns(\\infty) = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} s(x) = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\left(-\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0\n$$\nNow, we can substitute these values into the formula for the hitting probability:\n$$\np(x_0) = \\mathbb{P}_{x_0}(\\tau_0  \\tau_\\infty) = \\frac{s(\\infty) - s(x_0)}{s(\\infty) - s(0)} = \\frac{0 - (-1/x_0)}{0 - (-\\infty)}\n$$\nThe numerator is $1/x_0$, which is a finite positive value for any starting point $x_0 \\in (0, \\infty)$.

A boundary is said to be accessible if there is a positive probability of reaching it in finite time from at least one point in the interior of the domain. Since we have found that $\\mathbb{P}_{x_0}(\\tau_0  \\infty) = 0$ for all $x_0 \\in (0, \\infty)$, the boundary point $0$ is **inaccessible**.\n\nThe Feller boundary test for accessibility confirms this. A boundary $l$ is accessible from the interior if and only if the integral $\\int_{l}^{c} s'(y) \\, dy$ is finite for some $c \\in (l,r)$. In our case, for the boundary $l=0$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{c} s'(y) \\, dy = \\int_{0}^{c} y^{-2} \\, dy = \\left[-\\frac{1}{y}\\right]_{0}^{c} = -\\frac{1}{c} - \\lim_{y \\to 0^+} \\left(-\\frac{1}{y}\\right) = \\infty\n$$\nSince this integral diverges, the condition for accessibility is not met. The boundary at $0$ is inaccessible, which is consistent with the hitting probability being $0$. The strong positive drift $1/x$ near $x=0$ pushes the process away from the origin, overpowering the constant diffusion term and preventing the process from ever reaching $0$.\n\nThe final answer required is the value of the probability $p(x_0)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3053658"}, {"introduction": "This final practice demonstrates the predictive power of Feller's tests when applied to a family of processes dependent on a parameter.
