We proceed to the solution.\n\n### Analysis of the SDE\n\nThe given SDE is $dX_{t} = \\sigma(X_t) dB_t$ where the coefficient $\\sigma(x) = \\operatorname{sgn}(x)$ is discontinuous at $x=0$. Standard existence and uniqueness theorems for SDEs, which require Lipschitz continuous coefficients, do not apply here.\n\n### Pathwise Uniqueness\n\nWe are asked to use the Itô–Tanaka formula for the convex function $f(x)=|x|$. For a continuous semimartingale $X_t$, the formula is:\n$$|X_t| = |X_0| + \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(X_s) dX_s + L_t^0(X)$$\nwhere $L_t^0(X)$ is the local time of $X$ at $0$. The problem defines $\\operatorname{sgn}(0)=0$, but the specific value of the integrand $\\operatorname{sgn}(x)$ at $x=0$ does not alter the value of the Itô integral because the set of times $\\{s : X_s=0\\}$ has Lebesgue measure zero for any non-trivial solution, a fact we will confirm shortly.\n\nGiven $X_0 = 0$ and the SDE $dX_t = \\operatorname{sgn}(X_t) dB_t$, we substitute $dX_s$ into the formula:\n$$|X_t| = \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(X_s) (\\operatorname{sgn}(X_s) dB_s) + L_t^0(X) = \\int_0^t (\\operatorname{sgn}(X_s))^2 dB_s + L_t^0(X)$$\nFor any $x \\neq 0$, $(\\operatorname{sgn}(x))^2 = 1$. For $x=0$, $(\\operatorname{sgn}(0))^2 = 0$. So, the integrand is $(\\operatorname{sgn}(X_s))^2 = \\mathbf{1}_{\\{X_s \\neq 0\\}}$. The quadratic variation of any solution $X_t$ is $\\langle X \\rangle_t = \\int_0^t (\\operatorname{sgn}(X_s))^2 ds$. For any non-trivial solution of such an SDE, it is a known result (from the Engelbert-Schmidt zero-one law) that the set of zeros $\\{s : X_s=0\\}$ has Lebesgue measure zero almost surely. Thus, $\\int_0^t (\\operatorname{sgn}(X_s))^2 ds = \\int_0^t 1 ds = t$ almost surely. Since the integrand $(\\operatorname{sgn}(X_s))^2$ is equal to $1$ for almost every $s$ (in the sense of Lebesgue measure), the stochastic integral becomes:\n$$\\int_0^t (\\operatorname{sgn}(X_s))^2 dB_s = \\int_0^t 1 \\cdot dB_s = B_t$$\nThus, for any strong solution $X_t$, its absolute value must satisfy:\n$$|X_t| = B_t + L_t^0(X)$$\nThis equation is a form of the Skorokhod problem. It implies that for a given Brownian motion $B_t$, the process $|X_t|$ is uniquely determined. Specifically, $|X_t|$ is a reflecting Brownian motion, but one whose reflection is determined by adding a local time term to $B_t$ itself. The unique solution to this representation is $|X_t| = B_t - \\inf_{0 \\le s \\le t} B_s$.\nTherefore, for any two strong solutions $X_t^{(1)}$ and $X_t^{(2)}$ corresponding to the same Brownian motion $B_t$, we must have $|X_t^{(1)}| = |X_t^{(2)}|$.\n\nThis does not imply that $X_t^{(1)} = X_t^{(2)}$. The non-uniqueness can arise from the sign of the process. We can construct an explicit counterexample to demonstrate the failure of pathwise uniqueness.\nLet $W_t$ be a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion. Define a new process $B_t$ by the Itô integral:\n$$B_t = \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(W_s) dW_s$$\nBy Lévy's characterization of Brownian motion, since the integrand $\\operatorname{sgn}(W_s)$ has absolute value $1$ almost everywhere, the quadratic variation of $B_t$ is $\\langle B \\rangle_t = \\int_0^t (\\operatorname{sgn}(W_s))^2 ds = t$. As $B_t$ is a continuous local martingale starting at $0$, it is a standard Brownian motion.\n\nNow, consider the SDE $dX_t = \\operatorname{sgn}(X_t) dB_t$ with this specific $B_t$.\n1. Let $X_t^{(1)} = W_t$. Then $dX_t^{(1)} = dW_t$. The right-hand side of the SDE is $\\operatorname{sgn}(X_t^{(1)}) dB_t = \\operatorname{sgn}(W_t) dB_t$. By our definition of $B_t$, $dW_t = \\operatorname{sgn}(W_t) dB_t$. Thus, $X_t^{(1)}=W_t$ is a strong solution.\n2. Let $X_t^{(2)} = -W_t$. Then $dX_t^{(2)} = -dW_t$. The right-hand side is $\\operatorname{sgn}(X_t^{(2)}) dB_t = \\operatorname{sgn}(-W_t) dB_t = -\\operatorname{sgn}(W_t) dB_t = -(\\operatorname{sgn}(W_t))^2 dW_t = -dW_t$. This matches $dX_t^{(2)}$, so $X_t^{(2)}=-W_t$ is also a strong solution.\n\nSince $W_t$ is not identically zero, $X_t^{(1)}$ and $X_t^{(2)}$ are distinct processes. We have found two distinct strong solutions for the same Brownian motion $B_t$ and the same initial condition $X_0=0$. Therefore, pathwise uniqueness fails.\n\n### Uniqueness in Law\n\nA process $X_t$ is a solution to the SDE if it is continuous, adapted, and satisfies $X_t = \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(X_s) dB_s$. This implies that any solution $X_t$ is a continuous local martingale with $X_0=0$.\nThe quadratic variation of any such solution is:\n$$\\langle X \\rangle_t = \\left\\langle \\int \\operatorname{sgn}(X) dB, \\int \\operatorname{sgn}(X) dB \\right\\rangle_t = \\int_0^t (\\operatorname{sgn}(X_s))^2 d\\langle B \\rangle_s = \\int_0^t (\\operatorname{sgn}(X_s))^2 ds$$\nAs established before, for any non-trivial solution, the set $\\{s : X_s = 0\\}$ has Lebesgue measure zero a.s. Therefore, $(\\operatorname{sgn}(X_s))^2 = 1$ for a.e. $s \\in [0,t]$, and we have:\n$$\\langle X \\rangle_t = \\int_0^t 1 \\, ds = t \\quad \\text{a.s.}$$\nAccording to Lévy's characterization of Brownian motion, any continuous local martingale $M_t$ starting at $0$ with quadratic variation $\\langle M \\rangle_t = t$ is a standard Brownian motion.\nThis implies that any non-trivial solution $X_t$ to the SDE must have the same law as a standard Brownian motion.\n\nThe SDE also admits the trivial solution $X_t \\equiv 0$, since $dX_t=0$ and $\\operatorname{sgn}(X_t)dB_t = \\operatorname{sgn}(0)dB_t = 0$. The law of this process is a Dirac measure on the zero path, which is different from the Wiener measure (the law of a Brownian motion).\nHowever, for this class of SDEs ($dX_t = \\sigma(X_t) dB_t$ with $X_0=0$), a result by Engelbert and Schmidt states that uniqueness in law holds if and only if $\\sigma(x)=0 \\iff x=0$. In our case, $\\sigma(x)=\\operatorname{sgn}(x)$, which satisfies this condition. This implies that all solutions must have the same law. The existence of a non-trivial weak solution (which we can construct) with the law of a Brownian motion, combined with the principle of uniqueness in law, implies that this must be the law of any solution. The subtle technical reason this does not lead to a contradiction is related to the fact that for any weak solution $(X, B)$, one can show that $P(X \\equiv 0) = 0$.\n\nThus, uniqueness in law holds, and the law of any solution $X_t$ is that of a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion.\n\n### Characteristic Function\n\nThe final task is to compute the characteristic function $\\varphi_{X_{t}}(u) = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(iuX_{t})]$.\nFrom the analysis of uniqueness in law, we concluded that any solution process $X_t$ has the same law as a standard Brownian motion. Therefore, for any fixed time $t > 0$, the random variable $X_t$ has the same distribution as $B_t$.\nA standard Brownian motion at time $t$ follows a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $t$. That is, $X_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t)$.\n\nThe characteristic function of a normally distributed random variable $Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ is given by the formula:\n$$\\varphi_Y(u) = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(iuY)] = \\exp\\left(iu\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}u^2\\sigma^2\\right)$$\nFor our random variable $X_t$, the mean is $\\mu=0$ and the variance is $\\sigma^2=t$. Substituting these values into the formula, we obtain the characteristic function of $X_t$:\n$$\\varphi_{X_t}(u) = \\exp\\left(iu(0) - \\frac{1}{2}u^2 t\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}u^2 t\\right)$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}u^2 t\\right)}\n$$", "id": "3069544"}, {"introduction": "Building on the previous concepts, this practice explores how uniqueness properties can depend on the specific parameters of a model, using the celebrated Cox–Ingersoll–Ross (CIR) process from financial mathematics.

This classification is determined by the behavior of the scale function and the speed measure near the boundary.\n\nFirst, we determine the infinitesimal generator $\\mathcal{L}$ of the diffusion, which is defined for sufficiently smooth functions $f$ by\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}f(x) = a(x) \\frac{df}{dx} + \\frac{1}{2} b(x)^2 \\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}\n$$\nSubstituting the coefficients for the CIR process, we get\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}f(x) = \\kappa(\\theta - x)f'(x) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 x f''(x)\n$$\nThe scale function, denoted $s(x)$, is a strictly increasing function that satisfies the ordinary differential equation (ODE) $\\mathcal{L}s(x) = 0$. Let $u(x) = s'(x)$. The ODE for $s(x)$ becomes a first-order ODE for $u(x)$:\n$$\n\\kappa(\\theta - x)u(x) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 x u'(x) = 0\n$$\nThis is a separable ODE for $u(x)$ on the interval $(0, \\infty)$. We can rearrange it as\n$$\n\\frac{u'(x)}{u(x)} = -\\frac{2\\kappa(\\theta-x)}{\\sigma^2 x} = \\frac{2\\kappa}{\\sigma^2} - \\frac{2\\kappa\\theta}{\\sigma^2 x}\n$$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $x$ yields\n$$\n\\ln|u(x)| = \\frac{2\\kappa}{\\sigma^2}x - \\frac{2\\kappa\\theta}{\\sigma^2}\\ln(x) + C_0\n$$\nwhere $C_0$ is a constant of integration.

Since the scale function is unique up to affine transformations, we can set the constant $C_1=1$ without loss of generality. Thus, the density of the scale function is\n$$\ns'(x) = x^{-2\\kappa\\theta/\\sigma^2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\kappa}{\\sigma^2}x\\right)\n$$\nThe speed measure, $m(dx)$, has a density $m(x)$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure given by\n$$\nm(x) = \\frac{2}{b(x)^2 s'(x)} = \\frac{2}{\\sigma^2 x s'(x)}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $s'(x)$, we find\n$$\nm(x) = \\frac{2}{\\sigma^2 x} \\left(x^{-2\\kappa\\theta/\\sigma^2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\kappa}{\\sigma^2}x\\right)\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{2}{\\sigma^2} x^{-1} x^{2\\kappa\\theta/\\sigma^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\kappa}{\\sigma^2}x\\right)\n$$\n$$\nm(x) = \\frac{2}{\\sigma^2} x^{2\\kappa\\theta/\\sigma^2 - 1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\kappa}{\\sigma^2}x\\right)\n$$\nThe classification of the boundary at $x=0$ depends on the convergence of the integrals of $s'(x)$ and $m(x)$ on an interval $(0, c]$ for some $c>0$. Let us define\n$$\nI_s = \\int_0^c s'(x)dx \\quad \\text{and} \\quad I_m = \\int_0^c m(x)dx\n$$\nWe analyze the behavior of the integrands as $x \\to 0^+$.\nFor $s'(x)$, as $x \\to 0^+$, the term $\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\kappa}{\\sigma^2}x\\right) \\to 1$. Thus, the convergence of $I_s$ is determined by the convergence of $\\int_0^c x^{-2\\kappa\\theta/\\sigma^2} dx$. An integral of the form $\\int_0^c x^p dx$ converges if and only if $p > -1$.

In the scale-speed framework, a boundary is accessible if and only if the integral of the scale density, $I_s$, is finite. Therefore, the boundary at $x=0$ is accessible if $I_s < \\infty$, which corresponds to the condition:\n$$\n\\frac{2\\kappa\\theta}{\\sigma^2} < 1\n$$\nConversely, the boundary at $x=0$ is inaccessible if $I_s = \\infty$, which occurs when:\n$$\n\\frac{2\\kappa\\theta}{\\sigma^2} \\geq 1\n$$\nThis condition is the celebrated Feller condition for the boundary at $0$ to be non-attracting and inaccessible.\n\nThis boundary classification governs the uniqueness properties of the SDE. The diffusion coefficient $b(x) = \\sigma\\sqrt{x}$ is not Lipschitz continuous at $x=0$, as its derivative blows up. Standard existence and uniqueness theorems for SDEs do not apply directly over any interval including $0$.\n- If the boundary $x=0$ is inaccessible ($2\\kappa\\theta/\\sigma^2 \\geq 1$), a solution starting at $X_0=x_0>0$ will almost surely never reach $0$. On $(0, \\infty)$, the coefficients are locally Lipschitz, so pathwise uniqueness holds. For $X_0=0$, inaccessibility implies the process cannot enter the domain $(0, \\infty)$, so $X_t \\equiv 0$ is the unique solution. Thus, when $2\\kappa\\theta/\\sigma^2 \\geq 1$, pathwise uniqueness (and hence uniqueness in law) holds for all initial conditions $x_0 \\geq 0$.\n- If the boundary $x=0$ is accessible ($2\\kappa\\theta/\\sigma^2 < 1$), a solution starting at $x_0>0$ can reach $0$ in finite time. At this point, the failure of the Lipschitz condition allows for a breakdown of pathwise uniqueness. It is possible to construct multiple solutions for the same driving Brownian path, one of which might, for instance, reflect at the boundary while another is absorbed. Pathwise uniqueness fails. Uniqueness in law, a weaker concept, may still hold. It fails for $X_0=0$ if and only if the boundary at $0$ is of the `exit` type ($I_s < \\infty$ and $I_m=\\infty$), which corresponds to the case $\\theta=0$.\n\nThe problem asks for the single parameter combination that separates these regimes.

Let's estimate the inner integral $\\int_{y}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u^4/2)du$ using integration by parts, noting that $d(-\\exp(-u^4/2)) = 2u^3 \\exp(-u^4/2)du$:\n$$ \\int_{y}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u^4}{2}\\right) du = \\int_{y}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2u^3} \\left(2u^3 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u^4}{2}\\right)\\right) du $$\n$$ = \\left[ \\frac{1}{2u^3} \\cdot \\left(-\\exp\\left(-\\frac{u^4}{2}\\right)\\right) \\right]_{y}^{\\infty} - \\int_{y}^{\\infty} \\left( -\\frac{3}{2u^4} \\right) \\left(-\\exp\\left(-\\frac{u^4}{2}\\right)\\right) du $$\n$$ = \\frac{1}{2y^3} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^4}{2}\\right) - \\frac{3}{2} \\int_{y}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{u^4} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u^4}{2}\\right) du $$\nThe second term is of smaller order than the first for large $y$. Therefore, we have the asymptotic equivalence:\n$$ \\int_{y}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u^4}{2}\\right) du \\sim \\frac{1}{2y^3} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^4}{2}\\right) \\quad \\text{as } y \\to \\infty $$\nThe integrand of $I_+$ is $(S(\\infty) - S(y)) m(y)$, which for large $y$ behaves as:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{1}{2y^3} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^4}{2}\\right) \\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{y^4}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2y^3} $$\nSince the integral $\\int_{c}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{y^3} dy$ for any $c>0$ is convergent (it equals $1/(2c^2)$), the integral $I_+$ is finite.\n\nFor the boundary at $-\\infty$, we analyze:\n$$I_- = \\int_{-\\infty}^{a} (S(y) - S(-\\infty))\\, m(y)\\,dy$$\nAgain choosing $a=0$, we have $S(y) - S(-\\infty) = \\int_{-\\infty}^y \\exp(-u^4/2) du$. Due to the evenness of the functions $s(x)$ and $m(x)$, a change of variables $z = -y$ and $w = -u$ shows that $I_-$ is also finite and equal to $I_+$.\n$$I_- = \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{y} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u^4}{2}\\right) du \\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{y^4}{2}\\right) dy = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\int_{z}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{w^4}{2}\\right) dw \\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{z^4}{2}\\right) dz = I_+$$\nAccording to Feller's boundary classification, since these integrals are finite, both boundaries at $+\\infty$ and $-\\infty$ are accessible from the interior. This means the process $X_t$ can reach infinity in a finite amount of time with positive probability. Therefore, the solution is explosive.\n\n**(2) Pathwise Uniqueness up to Explosion**\n\nLet $X_t$ and $Y_t$ be two solutions to the SDE with the same initial condition $X_0 = Y_0 = x$ and driven by the same Brownian motion $B_t$. Pathwise uniqueness up to the explosion time $\\tau$ means that $X_t = Y_t$ for all $t < \\tau$, almost surely.\n\nLet $Z_t = (X_t - Y_t)^2$. Since $X_0 = Y_0$, we have $Z_0=0$. The difference process $D_t = X_t - Y_t$ satisfies $dD_t = (X_t^3 - Y_t^3)dt$. As this process has no diffusion term, it is of finite variation, and we can apply the standard rules of calculus pathwise.\n$$dZ_t = d((X_t - Y_t)^2) = 2(X_t - Y_t)d(X_t - Y_t) = 2(X_t - Y_t)(X_t^3 - Y_t^3)dt$$\nUsing the algebraic identity $a^3 - b^3 = (a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2)$, we have:\n$$dZ_t = 2(X_t - Y_t)^2(X_t^2 + X_tY_t + Y_t^2)dt = 2Z_t(X_t^2 + X_tY_t + Y_t^2)dt$$\nThe drift coefficient $b(x) = x^3$ is not globally Lipschitz, so we must use a localization argument. Let $\\tau_n^X = \\inf\\{t \\ge 0 : |X_t| \\ge n\\}$ and $\\tau_n^Y = \\inf\\{t \\ge 0 : |Y_t| \\ge n\\}$. We define a joint stopping time $\\tau_n = \\tau_n^X \\wedge \\tau_n^Y$. For any $t < \\tau_n$, we have $|X_t| < n$ and $|Y_t| < n$.\n\nFor $t < \\tau_n$, we can bound the quadratic term:\n$$ X_t^2 + X_tY_t + Y_t^2 \\le |X_t|^2 + |X_t||Y_t| + |Y_t|^2 < n^2 + n \\cdot n + n^2 = 3n^2 $$\nThus, for $t < \\tau_n$, $Z_t$ satisfies the deterministic differential inequality:\n$$ \\frac{dZ_t}{dt} = 2Z_t(X_t^2 + X_tY_t + Y_t^2) \\le 2Z_t(3n^2) = 6n^2 Z_t $$\nThis inequality can be written as $\\frac{dZ_t}{dt} - 6n^2 Z_t \\le 0$. We can apply the Gronwall inequality. Let's integrate this inequality from $0$ to $t$ for $t < \\tau_n$:\n$$ Z_t - Z_0 = \\int_0^t 2Z_s(X_s^2 + X_sY_s + Y_s^2)ds \\le \\int_0^t 6n^2 Z_s ds $$\nSince $Z_0 = 0$, we have $Z_t \\le \\int_0^t 6n^2 Z_s ds$.\nBy the integral form of Gronwall's inequality, if a non-negative continuous function $u(t)$ satisfies $u(t) \\le C \\int_0^t u(s)ds$, then $u(t) \\equiv 0$. Here, $Z_t$ is non-negative and continuous, and $C = 6n^2 > 0$. Thus, $Z_t = 0$ for all $t < \\tau_n$.\nThis implies $X_t = Y_t$ for all $t < \\tau_n$. By continuity of the paths, this equality extends to the stopping time, so $X_{t \\wedge \\tau_n} = Y_{t \\wedge \\tau_n}$ for all $t \\ge 0$. This holds for any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nThe explosion time is $\\tau = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\tau_n$. For any given sample path $\\omega$ and any time $t < \\tau(\\omega)$, there exists an integer $N$ such that $t < \\tau_n(\\omega)$ for all $n \\ge N$.\nFor such $n$, we have $t \\wedge \\tau_n(\\omega) = t$. From our previous result, we have $X_{t \\wedge \\tau_n}(\\omega) = Y_{t \\wedge \\tau_n}(\\omega)$, which implies $X_t(\\omega) = Y_t(\\omega)$.\nThis shows that $X_t = Y_t$ for all $t < \\tau$. By continuity, we can say $X_{t \\wedge \\tau} = Y_{t \\wedge \\tau}$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\nThis establishes pathwise uniqueness up to the explosion time $\\tau$.\n\n**Final Value of $p$**\n\nThe quantity $p$ is defined as:\n$$p \\coloneqq \\mathbb{P}\\Big(\\forall t \\geq 0,\\; X_{t \\wedge \\tau} = Y_{t \\wedge \\tau}\\Big)$$\nOur proof of pathwise uniqueness in part (2) demonstrated that for any two solutions $X$ and $Y$ starting from the same point and driven by the same Brownian motion, the event $\\{\\forall t \\geq 0,\\; X_{t \\wedge \\tau} = Y_{t \\wedge \\tau}\\}$ is true for almost every sample path. Therefore, the probability of this event is $1$.\n$$p=1$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3069581"}]}
