The standard method involves a localization argument, which proceeds by a sequence of approximations that are well-behaved, and then showing these approximations converge to a global solution.\n\n**A.

Let $\\tau_R=\\inf\\{t\\ge 0:|X_t^R|\\ge R\\}$. Use pathwise uniqueness to prove $X^R=X^S$ on $[0,\\tau_R\\wedge\\tau_S]$. Establish non-explosion by combining the linear growth bound with the Burkholder–Davis–Gundy inequality and Gronwall’s inequality to show $\\lim_{R\\to\\infty}\\tau_R=\\infty$ almost surely, and patch $\\{X^R\\}_{R\\ge 1}$ to define a global strong solution $X$.**\n\nThis option describes the canonical proof of existence and uniqueness for strong solutions under local Lipschitz and linear growth conditions.\n1.  **Truncation:** For each $R  0$, the functions $b_R(x) = b(x)\\phi_R(x)$ and $\\sigma_R(x) = \\sigma(x)\\phi_R(x)$ are constructed. Since $b$ and $\\sigma$ are locally Lipschitz and $\\phi_R$ is a smooth function with compact support, the truncated coefficients $b_R$ and $\\sigma_R$ are globally Lipschitz.\n2.  **Existence for Truncated SDE:** Since $b_R$ and $\\sigma_R$ are globally Lipschitz and satisfy a linear growth condition (they are in fact bounded), the standard existence and uniqueness theorem for SDEs with globally Lipschitz coefficients applies. This guarantees that for each $R0$, the SDE $dX_t^R = b_R(X_t^R)\\,dt + \\sigma_R(X_t^R)\\,dW_t$ has a unique strong solution $X^R$.\n3.  **Localization and Pasting:** Let $\\tau_R = \\inf\\{t\\ge 0:|X_t^R|\\ge R\\}$. For $t  \\tau_R$, we have $|X_s^R|R$ for $s\\le t$. On the ball $B(0, R)$, $\\phi_R(x)=1$, so $b_R(x)=b(x)$ and $\\sigma_R(x)=\\sigma(x)$. Thus, the process $X^R$ is a solution to the original SDE on the stochastic interval $[0, \\tau_R)$. Pathwise uniqueness, which holds for locally Lipschitz coefficients, ensures that for $SR$, the solutions $X^S$ and $X^R$ coincide on $[0, \\tau_R]$. This consistency allows us to define a process $X$ by setting $X_t = X_t^R$ for $t \\in [0, \\tau_R)$. This defines a solution up to the explosion time $\\tau_\\infty = \\lim_{R\\to\\infty} \\tau_R$.\n4.  **Non-Explosion:** The final step is to show $\\tau_\\infty = \\infty$ almost surely. This uses the linear growth condition. For any $T0$, one estimates $\\mathbb{E}[\\sup_{t\\in[0,T]}|X_{t\\wedge\\tau_R}|^2]$. Using the integral form of the SDE, Itô's formula, or direct estimation with Cauchy-Schwarz and the Burkholder-Davis-Gundy (BDG) inequality, one obtains an inequality of the form $f(t) \\le C_1 + C_2 \\int_0^t f(s) ds$ for $f(t) = \\mathbb{E}[\\sup_{u\\le t}|X_{u\\wedge\\tau_R}|^2]$. Gronwall's inequality then implies that $\\sup_R \\mathbb{E}[\\sup_{t\\in[0,T]}|X_{t\\wedge\\tau_R}|^2]  \\infty$. By Markov's inequality, $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_R \\le T) = \\mathbb{P}(\\sup_{t\\in[0,T]}|X_t^R| \\ge R) \\le R^{-2}\\mathbb{E}[\\sup_{t\\in[0,T]}|X_t^R|^2]$. Since the expectation is uniformly bounded in $R$, $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_R \\le T)\\to 0$ as $R\\to\\infty$. As $T$ is arbitrary, this implies $\\tau_\\infty = \\infty$ a.s.\nThe process $X$ is therefore a global, unique strong solution.\n\n**Verdict on A:** **Correct**. This option accurately details the standard mathematical construction.\n\n**B. Apply Picard iteration directly to the original SDE without truncation, relying on local Lipschitz continuity to obtain a contraction on the full space $\\mathbb{R}^d$, and then use Gronwall’s inequality to deduce global existence and uniqueness for the untruncated equation.**\n\nThe Picard iteration scheme for the SDE is $X_t^{(0)} = x_0$ and $X_t^{(n+1)} = x_0 + \\int_0^t b(X_s^{(n)})\\,ds + \\int_0^t \\sigma(X_s^{(n)})\\,dW_s$. To prove convergence, one estimates the difference $\\mathbb{E}[\\sup_{s\\le t}|X_s^{(n+1)} - X_s^{(n)}|^2]$. This requires a global Lipschitz constant to establish a contraction on the space of continuous-time processes. Local Lipschitz continuity only guarantees a Lipschitz property on bounded sets. A key statement in this option, \"...relying on local Lipschitz continuity to obtain a contraction on the full space $\\mathbb{R}^d$,\" is false. Local Lipschitz continuity does not imply a global contraction property. The standard Picard iteration argument fails without a global Lipschitz condition. The localization procedure in option A is designed precisely to circumvent this issue.\n\n**Verdict on B:** **Incorrect**. The proposed method is fundamentally flawed as it misapplies the contraction mapping principle.\n\n**C. Construct weak solutions via tightness of Euler–Maruyama approximations and convergence in distribution, and then invoke the Yamada–Watanabe principle to deduce strong existence, without separately verifying pathwise uniqueness under the stated hypotheses.**\n\nThis option outlines a well-known pathway from weak to strong solutions. The Yamada-Watanabe (YW) theorem states that if weak existence and pathwise uniqueness hold for an SDE, then a unique strong solution exists. The construction of a weak solution via tightness of numerical schemes is a standard technique. However, the option contains a fatal flaw in the clause \"without separately verifying pathwise uniqueness under the stated hypotheses.\" The YW theorem *requires* pathwise uniqueness as a premise. The local Lipschitz condition on $b$ and $\\sigma$ is precisely what is used to establish pathwise uniqueness (using Gronwall's inequality on the difference of two potential solutions). To apply the YW principle, one must first prove pathwise uniqueness. By stating this step is omitted, the described procedure is incomplete and thus invalid.\n\n**Verdict on C:** **Incorrect**. The procedure is logically incomplete because it fails to satisfy a crucial hypothesis of the Yamada-Watanabe theorem.\n\n**D. Define stopping times $\\tau_n=\\inf\\{t\\ge 0:|X_t|\\ge n\\}$ using the unknown solution $X$, and apply the deterministic Gronwall inequality only to $t\\mapsto \\mathbb{E}\\big[|X_{t\\wedge\\tau_n}|^2\\big]$ to conclude that $\\sup_{t\\le T}|X_{t\\wedge\\tau_n}|\\infty$ almost surely for each fixed $T0$, thereby obtaining global existence without using estimates on stochastic integrals.**\n\nThis option has multiple severe flaws.\n1.  **Circular Reasoning:** It defines the stopping time $\\tau_n$ in terms of the solution $X$, whose existence is what we are trying to prove. One must define stopping times with respect to the known, approximate solutions $X^n$ from the localization procedure.\n2.  **Trivial Conclusion:** The conclusion that $\\sup_{t\\le T}|X_{t\\wedge\\tau_n}|\\infty$ a.s. is trivial. Any continuous process on a finite interval $[0, T]$ is a.s. bounded. Stopping the process at $\\tau_n$ ensures its norm is bounded by $n$ (or its value at $T$). This shows nothing about non-explosion.\n3.  **Ignoring the Stochastic Integral:** The most egregious error is the claim of \"obtaining global existence without using estimates on stochastic integrals.\" The stochastic nature of the SDE is captured by the term $\\int \\sigma(X_s)dW_s$. The linear growth condition on $\\sigma$ is essential for controlling the growth of the solution. Its effect is only brought into the analysis through inequalities for stochastic integrals, such as the Itô isometry or the Burkholder-Davis-Gundy (BDG) inequality. Ignoring this term is equivalent to ignoring the noise, which would reduce the problem to an ODE, fundamentally misrepresenting the SDE.\n\n**Verdict on D:** **Incorrect**. This option is a cascade of mathematical errors, including circular reasoning, a trivial conclusion, and a fundamentally wrong approach that discards the essential stochastic component of the problem.\n\nBased on the analysis, only option A describes a correct and complete mathematical procedure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3078973"}, {"introduction": "Having established the general construction method, we now probe its boundaries by examining an SDE where the standard Lipschitz condition fails at the origin.

Existence of Weak Solutions**\n\nA standard theorem for the existence of weak solutions requires that the coefficients $b(x)$ and $\\sigma(x)$ be continuous and satisfy a linear growth condition.\n- **Continuity**: The drift coefficient $b(x) = 0$ is continuous for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The diffusion coefficient $\\sigma(x) = \\sqrt{|x|}$ is also continuous for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n- **Linear Growth Condition**: We need to find a constant $K  0$ such that for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $|b(x)| + |\\sigma(x)| \\le K(1 + |x|)$.\nSubstituting our coefficients:\n$$ |0| + \\sqrt{|x|} \\le K(1 + |x|) $$\nThis inequality must hold for some $K$. For $|x| \\ge 1$, we have $\\sqrt{|x|} \\le |x|$. For $|x|  1$, we have $\\sqrt{|x|}  1$. Thus, $\\sqrt{|x|} \\le 1 + |x|$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We can choose $K=1$.\nSince both conditions (continuity and linear growth) are satisfied, we can conclude that **at least one weak solution exists**.\n\nThis immediately shows that option **(C)**, which claims weak solutions do not exist, is **Incorrect**.\n\n**2. Uniqueness of Solutions**\n\nThe standard theorem for the existence and uniqueness of a strong solution requires both $b(x)$ and $\\sigma(x)$ to be globally or locally Lipschitz continuous. The drift $b(x)=0$ is globally Lipschitz. However, the diffusion coefficient $\\sigma(x) = \\sqrt{|x|}$ is not locally Lipschitz at $x=0$. To see this, consider the ratio $|\\sigma(x) - \\sigma(0)| / |x-0|$ as $x \\to 0$:\n$$ \\frac{|\\sqrt{|x|} - \\sqrt{0}|}{|x-0|} = \\frac{\\sqrt{|x|}}{|x|} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{|x|}} $$\nThis expression tends to $\\infty$ as $x \\to 0$, so $\\sigma(x)$ is not Lipschitz continuous in any neighborhood containing $0$. Therefore, the standard strong uniqueness theorem does not apply. We must use a more powerful criterion.\n\n**Pathwise Uniqueness: The Yamada–Watanabe Criterion**\n\nThe Yamada–Watanabe theorem provides sufficient conditions for pathwise uniqueness. One version of the criterion states that for an SDE of the form $dX_t = \\sigma(X_t)dW_t$, if there exists a strictly increasing, concave function $\\rho: [0, \\infty) \\to [0, \\infty)$ such that $\\rho(0)=0$, $\\int_{0^+} \\rho(u)^{-2} du = \\infty$, and $|\\sigma(x) - \\sigma(y)| \\le \\rho(|x-y|)$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then pathwise uniqueness holds.\n\nLet's check this for $\\sigma(x) = \\sqrt{|x|}$. We first need to bound $|\\sqrt{|x|} - \\sqrt{|y|}|$. Using the inequality $|\\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b}| \\le \\sqrt{|a-b|}$ for $a, b \\ge 0$, and the reverse triangle inequality $||x|-|y|| \\le |x-y|$, we get:\n$$ |\\sigma(x) - \\sigma(y)| = |\\sqrt{|x|} - \\sqrt{|y|}| \\le \\sqrt{||x|-|y||} \\le \\sqrt{|x-y|} $$\nThis suggests we can choose $\\rho(u) = \\sqrt{u}$. Let's verify the properties of $\\rho(u) = \\sqrt{u}$:\n- It is strictly increasing on $[0, \\infty)$.\n- It is concave on $[0, \\infty)$ since its second derivative $\\rho''(u) = -1/4 u^{-3/2}$ is negative for $u0$.\n- $\\rho(0) = 0$.\nFinally, we check the integral condition:\n$$ \\int_{0^+} \\frac{du}{\\rho(u)^2} = \\int_{0^+} \\frac{du}{(\\sqrt{u})^2} = \\int_{0^+} \\frac{1}{u} du = [\\ln(u)]_{0^+}^\\epsilon = \\ln(\\epsilon) - \\lim_{u\\to 0^+} \\ln(u) = \\infty $$\nThe integral diverges. All conditions of the Yamada–Watanabe criterion are met. Therefore, **pathwise uniqueness holds** for this SDE.\n\nThis conclusion shows that options **(B)** and **(E)**, which claim pathwise uniqueness fails, are **Incorrect**.\n\n**Weak Uniqueness**\n\nPathwise uniqueness is a stronger condition than weak uniqueness (uniqueness in law). If for any given driving Brownian motion $W_t$ there is only one solution process $X_t$, then the law of the solution process is uniquely determined by the law of the driving process. Since all standard Brownian motions have the same law, all weak solutions must also have the same law. Therefore, pathwise uniqueness implies weak uniqueness. Since pathwise uniqueness holds, **weak uniqueness must also hold**.\n\nThis shows that option **(D)**, which claims weak uniqueness fails, is **Incorrect**.\n\n**Strong Solution**\n\nThe Yamada–Watanabe theorem states that the existence of a weak solution combined with pathwise uniqueness implies the existence of a unique strong solution. We have established both premises.\n- Weak existence holds.\n- Pathwise uniqueness holds.\nTherefore, **a unique strong solution exists**.\n\nLet's identify this solution. Consider the deterministic process $X_t \\equiv 0$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\n- Initial condition: $X_0 = 0$ is satisfied.\n- SDE: The integral form is $X_t = X_0 + \\int_0^t \\sqrt{|X_s|} dW_s$.\nSubstituting $X_t = 0$:\n$$ 0 = 0 + \\int_0^t \\sqrt{|0|} dW_s = 0 + \\int_0^t 0 \\, dW_s = 0 $$\nThe equation holds. Thus, $X_t \\equiv 0$ is a solution. Since we have proven that a unique strong solution exists, this must be it.

A weak solution to an SDE is a triple consisting of a filtered probability space, a Brownian motion, and an adapted process that satisfies the SDE in the Itô sense; a strong solution is a solution adapted to the filtration generated by the given Brownian motion. Pathwise uniqueness means that if two solutions are defined on the same filtered probability space and are driven by the same Brownian motion, then they are indistinguishable. Uniqueness in law means the distribution of the solution (for a fixed initial distribution) is unique across all weak solutions. The Yamada–Watanabe theorem (YW theorem) states that weak existence plus pathwise uniqueness implies strong existence and uniqueness in law; moreover, weak uniqueness together with strong existence implies pathwise uniqueness.\n\nYour task is to select the option that correctly provides an example of an SDE where uniqueness in law holds but pathwise uniqueness fails, and to correctly interpret how this fits within the Yamada–Watanabe framework.

The task is to apply these concepts to identify a correct example among a set of choices. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains no internal contradictions, ambiguities, or unsound premises.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the solution derivation and option analysis.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires finding an example of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that satisfies two conditions:\n1.  Uniqueness in law holds.\n2.  Pathwise uniqueness fails.\n\nLet's analyze the consequences of these conditions using the provided Yamada–Watanabe (YW) theorem. The second part of the theorem states:\n$$ (\\text{Uniqueness in Law}) \\land (\\text{Strong Existence}) \\implies (\\text{Pathwise Uniqueness}) $$\nThe contrapositive of this statement is:\n$$ \\neg(\\text{Pathwise Uniqueness}) \\implies \\neg(\\text{Uniqueness in Law}) \\lor \\neg(\\text{Strong Existence}) $$\nIf we are looking for an SDE where uniqueness in law holds but pathwise uniqueness fails, we have the premises:\n-   $\\neg(\\text{Pathwise Uniqueness})$ is true.\n-   $\\text{Uniqueness in Law}$ is true, which means $\\neg(\\text{Uniqueness in Law})$ is false.\n\nSubstituting these into the contrapositive statement, we get:\n$$ \\text{True} \\implies (\\text{False}) \\lor \\neg(\\text{Strong Existence}) $$\nFor this implication to hold, the right side must be true. Since the first part of the disjunction is false, the second part must be true. Therefore, a necessary consequence is:\n$$ \\neg(\\text{Strong Existence}) $$\nIn summary, any SDE that has uniqueness in law but fails to have pathwise uniqueness cannot have a strong solution. A complete example must therefore exhibit:\n1.  Weak existence.\n2.  Uniqueness in law.\n3.  Failure of pathwise uniqueness.\n4.  Failure of strong existence.\n\nNow, I will analyze each option based on these criteria.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The SDE is $dX_t = \\operatorname{sgn}(X_t)\\, dW_t$ with $X_0 = 0$, where $\\operatorname{sgn}(x)$ is the sign function with $\\operatorname{sgn}(0) = 0$. For any weak solution $X$, the quadratic variation satisfies $\\langle X \\rangle_t = \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}^2(X_s)\\, ds = t$ almost surely, so $X$ is a Brownian motion in law, giving uniqueness in law. However, pathwise uniqueness fails because different solutions driven by the same Brownian motion can be constructed by randomizing the sign choices at hitting times of $0$. This aligns with the YW theorem in that weak uniqueness holds but pathwise uniqueness fails, which implies there is no strong solution.**\n\nThis is the Tanaka SDE, a canonical example for this phenomenon.\n-   **Uniqueness in Law:** Let $(X_t, W_t)$ be a weak solution. By definition, $X_t = \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(X_s) dW_s$. $X_t$ is a continuous local martingale starting at $X_0=0$. Its quadratic variation is given by $\\langle X \\rangle_t = \\int_0^t (\\operatorname{sgn}(X_s))^2 d\\langle W \\rangle_s$. For a non-trivial solution, the set of times $\\{s: X_s = 0\\}$ has Lebesgue measure zero. Thus, $(\\operatorname{sgn}(X_s))^2 = 1$ for almost every $s$. Since $\\langle W \\rangle_s = s$, we have $\\langle X \\rangle_t = \\int_0^t 1 \\, ds = t$. By Lévy's characterization of Brownian motion, any continuous local martingale $X_t$ with $X_0=0$ and $\\langle X \\rangle_t = t$ must be a standard Brownian motion. Therefore, any weak solution has the law of a standard Brownian motion. This means uniqueness in law holds. The argument in the option is correct.\n-   **Pathwise Uniqueness:** This SDE is known to lack pathwise uniqueness. The diffusion coefficient $\\sigma(x) = \\operatorname{sgn}(x)$ is not locally Lipschitz nor does it satisfy other common sufficient conditions for pathwise uniqueness (like the non-degeneracy condition $\\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\sigma(x)^{-2}dx = \\infty$). The failure of pathwise uniqueness can be proven rigorously by showing that its existence would imply the existence of a strong solution, which leads to a contradiction. The explanation about \"randomizing sign choices\" is an intuitive, albeit informal, pointer to the reason for this failure.\n-   **Interpretation:** The option states that \"weak uniqueness holds but pathwise uniqueness fails, which implies there is no strong solution.\" As derived above from the YW theorem, this logical implication is correct.\n\nAll parts of this option—the SDE, the analysis of its properties, and the aplication of the YW theorem—are correct.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The SDE is $dX_t = -X_t\\, dt + dW_t$ with $X_0 = 0$. The coefficients are globally Lipschitz. The claim is that uniqueness in law holds while pathwise uniqueness fails, and this shows that the YW theorem does not require pathwise uniqueness for strong solutions.**\n\nThis is the SDE for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.\n-   **Analysis:** The drift coefficient $b(x) = -x$ and the diffusion coefficient $\\sigma(x)=1$ are both globally Lipschitz continuous. A fundamental theorem of SDEs states that if the coefficients are globally Lipschitz, there exists a unique strong solution. A strong solution is, by its nature, pathwise unique. Since strong existence and pathwise uniqueness hold, the YW theorem further implies that uniqueness in law holds. The claim that pathwise uniqueness fails is false.\n-   **Interpretation:** The interpretation is also flawed. A strong solution is inherently pathwise unique. The statement that the YW theorem \"does not require pathwise uniqueness for strong solutions\" is nonsensical.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The SDE is $dX_t = |X_t|^\\alpha\\, dW_t$ with $X_0 = 0$ and $\\alpha \\in (0, 1/2)$. The claim is that uniqueness in law holds but pathwise uniqueness fails, illustrating that weak uniqueness does not imply strong existence in the YW theorem.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** For this SDE, the diffusion coefficient is $\\sigma(x) = |x|^\\alpha$. The Engelbert-Schmidt zero-one law provides criteria for uniqueness for SDEs of the form $dX_t = \\sigma(X_t) dW_t$. Pathwise uniqueness (and uniqueness in law) fails if $\\int_0^\\epsilon \\sigma(x)^{-2} dx  \\infty$. Here, $\\sigma(x)^{-2} = |x|^{-2\\alpha}$. The integral is $\\int_0^\\epsilon x^{-2\\alpha} dx = [\\frac{x^{1-2\\alpha}}{1-2\\alpha}]_0^\\epsilon$. Since $\\alpha \\in (0, 1/2)$, we have $1-2\\alpha  0$, so the integral is finite. Thus, both pathwise uniqueness and uniqueness in law fail. A simple way to see the failure of uniqueness in law is to note that $X_t=0$ is a valid (trivial) solution, but non-trivial weak solutions also exist, which clearly have a different law. The option's claim that uniqueness in law holds is false.\n-   **Interpretation:** The statement that this example illustrates \"that weak uniqueness does not imply strong existence\" is based on a false premise, since weak uniqueness does not hold for this SDE.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The SDE is $dX_t = dW_t$ with $X_0 = 0$. The claim is that uniqueness in law holds but pathwise uniqueness fails, and this shows that the YW theorem can fail even for constant coefficients.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** The solution to this SDE is simply $X_t = W_t$. Given a Brownian motion $W_t$, the solution is uniquely determined as $W_t$ itself. Therefore, pathwise uniqueness holds trivially. As in option B, the coefficients ($b(x)=0, \\sigma(x)=1$) are globally Lipschitz, guaranteeing a unique strong solution. The claim that pathwise uniqueness fails is false.\n-   **Interpretation:** The YW theorem does not fail for this SDE; on the contrary, this is a textbook case where all conditions for existence and uniqueness are met and the theorem's implications hold perfectly.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3078966"}]}
