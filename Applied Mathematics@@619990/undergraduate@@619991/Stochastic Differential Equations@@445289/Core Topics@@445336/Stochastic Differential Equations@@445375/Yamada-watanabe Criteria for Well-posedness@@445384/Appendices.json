Your answer must be the single numerical value of α*.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is a well-posed question within the established mathematical framework of stochastic differential equations and is free from any scientific or logical inconsistencies.\n\nWe are asked to find the threshold value α* for the parameter $\\alpha \\geq 0$ that determines the boundary for pathwise uniqueness of the one-dimensional stochastic differential equation (SDE):\n$$dX_{t} = |X_{t}|^{\\alpha}\\, dW_{t}, \\quad X_{0} = x_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}$$\nThe drift coefficient is $b(x) = 0$ and the diffusion coefficient is $\\sigma(x) = |x|^{\\alpha}$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the pathwise uniqueness using the standard local Lipschitz condition. The drift coefficient $b(x)=0$ is globally Lipschitz. We examine the diffusion coefficient $\\sigma(x) = |x|^{\\alpha}$.\nFor $\\alpha \\geq 1$, the function $\\sigma(x)$ is locally Lipschitz on $\\mathbb{R}$. If $\\alpha=1$, $\\sigma(x)=|x|$ is globally Lipschitz with constant $1$, since for any $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $||x|-|y|| \\leq |x-y|$. If $\\alpha > 1$, the function $f(u)=u^\\alpha$ for $u \\geq 0$ is continuously differentiable, and its derivative $f'(u) = \\alpha u^{\\alpha-1}$ is bounded on any compact interval. By the Mean Value Theorem, for any $x, y$ in a compact set, $\\sigma(x)$ is locally Lipschitz. The local Lipschitz property of both coefficients is a sufficient condition for the existence of a unique strong solution, which implies pathwise uniqueness. Thus, for all $\\alpha \\geq 1$, pathwise uniqueness holds.\n\nFor $0 \\leq \\alpha  1$, the function $\\sigma(x)=|x|^\\alpha$ is not locally Lipschitz at $x=0$. To see this, consider the ratio $\\frac{|\\sigma(x) - \\sigma(0)|}{|x-0|} = \\frac{|x|^\\alpha}{|x|} = |x|^{\\alpha-1}$. As $x \\to 0$, this ratio approaches $\\infty$ because the exponent $\\alpha-1$ is negative. Therefore, we must employ a more general criterion, as suggested by the problem statement, namely the Yamada-Watanabe criterion.\n\nThe Yamada-Watanabe theorem provides a sufficient condition for pathwise uniqueness. For an SDE of the form $dX_t = \\sigma(X_t) dW_t$ (since our drift is zero), pathwise uniqueness holds if there exists a continuous, non-decreasing function $k: [0, \\infty) \\to [0, \\infty)$ such that $k(0)=0$, $k(u) > 0$ for $u>0$, and for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$:\n$1$. $|\\sigma(x) - \\sigma(y)| \\leq k(|x-y|)$\n$2$. $\\int_{0+}^{\\epsilon} \\frac{1}{k(u)^2} du = \\infty$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$.\n\nLet's apply this to $\\sigma(x) = |x|^{\\alpha}$ for $0  \\alpha \\leq 1$. For any non-negative numbers $a, b$, a standard inequality states that $|a^{\\alpha}-b^{\\alpha}| \\leq |a-b|^{\\alpha}$. Let $a=|x|$ and $b=|y|$. We have $||x|^{\\alpha} - |y|^{\\alpha}| \\leq ||x|-|y||^{\\alpha}$. Using the reverse triangle inequality, $||x|-|y|| \\leq |x-y|$. Combining these, we get:\n$$|\\sigma(x) - \\sigma(y)| = ||x|^{\\alpha} - |y|^{\\alpha}| \\leq |x-y|^{\\alpha}$$\nThis suggests we can choose the function $k(u) = u^{\\alpha}$. For $\\alpha > 0$, this function satisfies the properties of being continuous, non-decreasing, and $k(0)=0, k(u)>0$ for $u>0$.\n\nNow we check the integral condition:\n$$\\int_{0+}^{\\epsilon} \\frac{1}{k(u)^2} du = \\int_{0+}^{\\epsilon} \\frac{1}{(u^{\\alpha})^2} du = \\int_{0+}^{\\epsilon} u^{-2\\alpha} du$$\nThis improper integral of the form $\\int_{0+} u^p du$ diverges if and only if the exponent $p \\leq -1$. In our case, $p = -2\\alpha$. So, the condition for divergence is $-2\\alpha \\leq -1$, which simplifies to $2\\alpha \\geq 1$, or $\\alpha \\geq 1/2$.\nThis result, derived for $\\alpha \\in (0, 1]$, together with our previous finding for $\\alpha \\geq 1$, establishes that pathwise uniqueness holds for all $\\alpha \\geq 1/2$.\n\nTo establish α* = 1/2 as the sharp threshold, we must demonstrate that pathwise uniqueness may fail for $\\alpha  1/2$. For this, we use a converse result. A theorem by Engelbert and Schmidt states that for the SDE $dX_t = \\sigma(X_t) dW_t$ where $\\sigma$ is continuous and $\\sigma(0)=0$, pathwise uniqueness holds if and only if $\\int_{0+}^{\\epsilon} \\frac{1}{\\sigma(x)^2} dx = \\infty$.\nThis criterion applies to our problem for $\\alpha > 0$, since $\\sigma(x)=|x|^\\alpha$ is continuous and $\\sigma(0)=0$. For $x>0$, the integral is:\n$$\\int_{0+}^{\\epsilon} \\frac{1}{(x^{\\alpha})^2} dx = \\int_{0+}^{\\epsilon} x^{-2\\alpha} dx$$\nThis integral converges if the exponent $-2\\alpha > -1$, which means $2\\alpha  1$, or $\\alpha  1/2$.\nThe convergence of this integral implies that pathwise uniqueness fails. Thus, for any $\\alpha \\in (0, 1/2)$, pathwise uniqueness does not hold.\n\nFinally, we consider the case $\\alpha = 0$. The SDE becomes $dX_t = |X_t|^0 dW_t = 1 \\cdot dW_t = dW_t$. The solution is $X_t = x_0 + W_t$. This solution is clearly unique. Formally, the diffusion coefficient is $\\sigma(x) = 1$, which is globally Lipschitz with a Lipschitz constant of $L=0$. Pathwise uniqueness is therefore guaranteed.\n\nIn summary:\n- For $\\alpha=0$, pathwise uniqueness holds.\n- For $0  \\alpha  1/2$, pathwise uniqueness fails.\n- For $\\alpha \\geq 1/2$, pathwise uniqueness holds.\n\nThe problem asks for a threshold value α* such that pathwise uniqueness holds for all $\\alpha \\geq α*$ and may fail for $\\alpha  α*$. Based on our analysis, the set of $\\alpha$ for which uniqueness holds is $\\{0\\} \\cup [1/2, \\infty)$. The largest semi-infinite interval of the form $[A, \\infty)$ contained in this set is $[1/2, \\infty)$. Therefore, the threshold is α* = 1/2.

We will analyze each statement based on classical criteria for uniqueness, primarily the Yamada-Watanabe and Engelbert-Schmidt theorems.\n\nA key result for the driftless case ($b \\equiv 0$) is the Engelbert-Schmidt zero-one law. For the SDE $dX_t = \\sigma(X_t) dW_t$ starting from $X_0 = x_0$ where $\\sigma(x_0)=0$, pathwise uniqueness holds if and only if the integral of $\\sigma(x)^{-2}$ diverges on any neighborhood of $x_0$. Specifically, if $\\sigma(x) \\neq 0$ for $x \\neq x_0$ near $x_0$, uniqueness holds if and only if $\\int_{x_0-\\epsilon}^{x_0+\\epsilon} \\sigma(x)^{-2} dx = \\infty$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$.\n\nFor SDEs with a drift term, the behavior of $b(x)$ interacts with that of $\\sigma(x)$. The Yamada-Watanabe theorem provides a powerful criterion. Pathwise uniqueness holds if $b$ is Lipschitz continuous and $\\sigma$ satisfies $|\\sigma(x) - \\sigma(y)| \\le \\rho(|x-y|)$ for a function $\\rho$ such that $\\int_{0^+} \\rho(u)^{-2} du = \\infty$. This result has extensions, for instance, by relaxing the condition on $b$ to one-sided Lipschitz and on $\\sigma$ to just being continuous, provided that pathwise uniqueness holds for the driftless equation and $b$ is bounded and measurable (via Girsanov's theorem).\n\nWe now evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. For $\\sigma(x)=|x|^{\\alpha}$ with $0  \\alpha  1/2$ and $b\\equiv 0$, pathwise uniqueness may fail at $x=0$ because $\\sigma(0)=0$ allows the identically zero process as a solution while there also exist solutions that leave $0$. If $\\sigma$ is modified to be uniformly elliptic in a neighborhood of $0$ (e.g., $\\inf_{|x|\\le 1}\\sigma(x)\\ge c0$), then pathwise uniqueness is restored under standard local regularity on $b$ and $\\sigma$.**\n\nThe first part of the statement concerns the SDE $dX_t = |X_t|^\\alpha dW_t$ with $X_0=0$. We apply the Engelbert-Schmidt criterion. The relevant integral is:\n$$ \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\sigma(x)^{-2} dx = \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} (|x|^\\alpha)^{-2} dx = \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} |x|^{-2\\alpha} dx = 2 \\int_{0}^{\\epsilon} x^{-2\\alpha} dx $$\nThis integral is of the form $\\int_0^\\epsilon x^p dx$, which converges if and only if $p > -1$. Here, $p = -2\\alpha$. Thus, the integral converges if $-2\\alpha > -1$, which simplifies to $2\\alpha  1$, or $\\alpha  1/2$. According to the Engelbert-Schmidt theorem, since the integral converges for $0  \\alpha  1/2$, pathwise uniqueness fails. The process $X_t \\equiv 0$ is a trivial solution, and the failure of uniqueness implies the existence of other, non-zero solutions starting from $0$. This part of the statement is correct.\n\nThe second part posits that making $\\sigma$ uniformly elliptic restores uniqueness. Uniform ellipticity means that $\\sigma(x)$ is bounded away from zero, i.e., $\\inf_{x \\in K} |\\sigma(x)| > 0$ for compact sets $K$. If, for instance, $\\inf_{|x|\\le 1}\\sigma(x)\\ge c > 0$, the degeneracy at $x=0$ is removed. Under standard local regularity conditions, typically meaning local Lipschitz continuity for both $b$ and $\\sigma$, pathwise uniqueness is a classical result (proven via Itô-Picard iteration or Gronwall's inequality). Thus, removing the degeneracy indeed restores uniqueness. This part is also correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire statement is correct.\n\n**Verdict for A: Correct**\n\n**B. For $\\sigma(x)=|x|^{\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha\\ge 1/2$ and $b$ bounded and measurable, pathwise uniqueness holds; this is consistent with Yamada–Watanabe-type conditions relating the modulus of continuity of $\\sigma$ to uniqueness.**\n\nFirst, consider the driftless case ($b \\equiv 0$) with $\\sigma(x)=|x|^\\alpha$ and $\\alpha \\ge 1/2$. Using the Engelbert-Schmidt criterion as in A, the integral $\\int_{0}^{\\epsilon} x^{-2\\alpha} dx$ diverges if $-2\\alpha \\le -1$, i.e., $\\alpha \\ge 1/2$. This implies that for the SDE $dX_t = |X_t|^\\alpha dW_t$, pathwise uniqueness holds.\n\nNext, we add a bounded, measurable drift term $b(x)$. A standard result, demonstrable with Girsanov's theorem, is that if pathwise uniqueness holds for the driftless SDE $dY_t = \\sigma(Y_t)dW_t$, then it also holds for $dX_t = b(X_t)dt + \\sigma(X_t)dW_t$ provided $b$ is bounded and measurable. Since uniqueness holds for the driftless case when $\\alpha \\ge 1/2$, it continues to hold with such a drift term.\n\nFinally, we check consistency with the Yamada-Watanabe condition. The condition requires finding a function $\\rho$ such that $|\\sigma(x)-\\sigma(y)| \\le \\rho(|x-y|)$ and $\\int_{0^+} \\rho(u)^{-2} du = \\infty$. For $\\sigma(x) = |x|^\\alpha$:\n- If $1/2 \\le \\alpha \\le 1$, the function $|x|^\\alpha$ is Hölder continuous with exponent $\\alpha$. We can take $\\rho(u) = C u^\\alpha$ for some constant $C>0$. The integral is $\\int_{0^+} (Cu^\\alpha)^{-2} du = C^{-2} \\int_{0^+} u^{-2\\alpha} du$. This diverges for $-2\\alpha \\le -1$, i.e., $\\alpha \\ge 1/2$.\n- If $\\alpha > 1$, the function $|x|^\\alpha$ is locally Lipschitz and its derivative vanishes at $x=0$, so for $|x|,|y| \\le 1$ we can find $C$ such that $||x|^\\alpha - |y|^\\alpha| \\le C|x-y|$. A more careful analysis shows we can still use $\\rho(u)=Cu$ near $0$, for which $\\int_0^+ (Cu)^{-2}du$ diverges.\nThe Yamada-Watanabe modulus of continuity condition is indeed satisfied for all $\\alpha \\ge 1/2$.\n\nTherefore, the statement is correct in all its assertions.\n\n**Verdict for B: Correct**\n\n**C. For any $\\alpha0$, even if $\\sigma(x)=|x|^{\\alpha}$ vanishes at $x=0$, pathwise uniqueness holds provided $b$ is globally Lipschitz with linear growth. In other words, a globally Lipschitz drift compensates any degeneracy of $\\sigma$.**\n\nThis statement claims that a globally Lipschitz drift is sufficient to guarantee pathwise uniqueness, regardless of the severity of the degeneracy in $\\sigma$. This is false.\nConsider the case $0  \\alpha  1/2$, for which we know uniqueness fails when $b \\equiv 0$. Let us choose a globally Lipschitz drift that also vanishes at $x=0$, for example $b(x) = kx$ for some constant $k$. The SDE is $dX_t = kX_t dt + |X_t|^\\alpha dW_t$.\nThe process $X_t \\equiv 0$ is a solution, as $b(0)=0$ and $\\sigma(0)=0$. The question is whether other solutions starting at $X_0=0$ exist. It is a known result in SDE theory that for $0  \\alpha  1/2$, pathwise uniqueness still fails. A criterion by Nakao shows that if $\\sigma(x_0)=b(x_0)=0$ and $\\int_{x_0-\\epsilon}^{x_0+\\epsilon} \\frac{1+|b(x)|}{\\sigma(x)^2} dx  \\infty$, uniqueness may fail. For our case, this integral is $\\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\frac{1+|kx|}{|x|^{2\\alpha}} dx$, which converges for $\\alpha  1/2$. The Lipschitz nature of the drift does not compensate for the rapid decay of $\\sigma(x)$ near its zero.\n\n**Verdict for C: Incorrect**\n\n**D. If $\\sigma$ is continuous and has at most polynomial growth, then pathwise uniqueness holds regardless of whether $\\sigma$ vanishes at some points.**\n\nThis is a very strong and incorrect generalization. The analysis for statement A provides a direct counterexample. Let $\\sigma(x) = |x|^\\alpha$ with $b \\equiv 0$ and $0  \\alpha  1/2$.\n- $\\sigma$ is continuous.\n- $\\sigma$ has polynomial growth (it is even sub-linear, since $\\alpha  1$).\n- $\\sigma(0) = 0$.\nAs established, pathwise uniqueness fails for this SDE. The simple fact of $\\sigma$ vanishing is not the issue; it is the *rate* at which it vanishes that matters. The modulus of continuity of $\\sigma$ at its zeros is the critical factor, which this statement completely ignores.\n\n**Verdict for D: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Even if $\\sigma$ vanishes at isolated points, pathwise uniqueness can be restored when $b$ is locally bounded and one-sided Lipschitz (monotone) and $\\sigma$ satisfies a Yamada–Watanabe modulus condition $|\\sigma(x)-\\sigma(y)|\\le \\rho(|x-y|)$ for some modulus $\\rho$ with $\\int_{0^{+}}\\rho(u)^{-2}\\,du=+\\infty$.**\n\nThis statement is a precise formulation of a celebrated theorem that extends the original Yamada-Watanabe result. Let's examine the conditions:\n1.  **Condition on $\\sigma$**: The criterion $|\\sigma(x)-\\sigma(y)|\\le \\rho(|x-y|)$ with $\\int_{0^{+}}\\rho(u)^{-2}\\,du=+\\infty$ is exactly the Yamada-Watanabe condition on the diffusion coefficient. As seen in the analysis of B, this condition is key to controlling the quadratic variation term in an Itô-formula-based proof and is satisfied by functions like $|x|^\\alpha$ for $\\alpha \\ge 1/2$, which do vanish.\n2.  **Condition on $b$**: The standard Yamada-Watanabe theorem assumes a Lipschitz drift. However, the result holds under the weaker assumption that $b$ is one-sided Lipschitz, meaning $(x-y)(b(x)-b(y)) \\le K(x-y)^2$ for some constant $K$. This condition is sufficient to control the drift term when using Itô's formula on $\\|X_t-Y_t\\|^2$. The additional assumption of local boundedness is a standard technical requirement.\n\nThe combination of the Yamada-Watanabe integral condition on $\\sigma$ and the one-sided Lipschitz condition on $b$ is a well-known set of sufficient conditions for pathwise uniqueness.

We constructed, for any stopping time $\\tau$, a process $X$ that is a strong solution driven by the given $B$, which stays at $0$ up to $\\tau$ and then evolves as a Brownian motion thereafter.

Two canonical solutions in law are:\n- Absorbing Brownian motion at $0$: the process behaves as Brownian motion on $(0,\\infty)$ and, upon hitting $0$, remains at $0$ thereafter.\n- Reflecting Brownian motion at $0$: the process behaves as Brownian motion on $(0,\\infty)$ and is instantaneously reflected at $0$ (the Skorokhod reflection), spending zero Lebesgue time at $0$.\nBoth solve the martingale problem for test functions $f$ supported inside $(0,\\infty)$, since on $(0,\\infty)$ the generator is $\\tfrac12 f''$ and the distinction arises only at the boundary. Their laws started from $0$ are different. Thus, without a boundary condition, uniqueness in law fails. This exemplifies that nonstandard or unspecified boundary behavior breaks well-posedness, even though the interior coefficients are regular. Verdict: Correct.\n\nOption E. If $\\sigma(x)\\equiv 1$ on $\\mathbb{R}$, then the SDE reduces to $X_t=X_0+B_t$, which has a unique strong solution and enjoys pathwise and weak uniqueness. This highlights that the earlier nonuniqueness was caused by the state-dependent degeneracy at $0$, not by any irregularity in the interior coefficients. Verdict: Correct.\n\nIn light of the Yamada–Watanabe principle, the failure of pathwise uniqueness in the original SDE prevents us from concluding strong well-posedness; moreover, because weak uniqueness also fails, the SDE is not well-posed in any sense without further specification (such as a precise boundary condition or a “stickiness” parameter) at $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BDE}$$", "id": "3083468"}]}
