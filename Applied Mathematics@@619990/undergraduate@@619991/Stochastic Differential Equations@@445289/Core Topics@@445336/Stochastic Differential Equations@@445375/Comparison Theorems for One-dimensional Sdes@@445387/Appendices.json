The function of interest is $f(x) = x^{+} = \\max(0, x)$, which is a convex function.\n\nThe general Itô-Tanaka formula for a continuous semimartingale $S_t$ and a twice-differentiable function $f$ is a special case of the broader formula for convex functions. For a general convex function $f$, the formula for $f(S_t)$ is given by:\n$$\nf(S_t) = f(S_0) + \\int_0^t f'_-(S_s) \\, dS_s + \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} L_t^a(S) \\, f''(da)\n$$\nwhere $f'_-$ denotes the left-hand derivative of $f$, $f''(da)$ is the second derivative of $f$ in the sense of distributions (a measure on $\\mathbb{R}$), and $L_t^a(S)$ is the symmetric local time of $S$ at the level $a$.\n\nWe apply this formula to the process $S_t = Z_t$ and the function $f(x) = x^{+}$.\nFirst, we need to determine the derivatives of $f(x) = x^{+}$.\nThe function is $f(x) = x$ for $x \\ge 0$ and $f(x) = 0$ for $x  0$.\nThe left-hand derivative, $f'_{-}(x)$, is given by:\n$$\nf'_{-}(x) = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if } x  0 \\\\ 0  \\text{if } x \\le 0 \\end{cases}\n$$\nThis can be written compactly using an indicator function as $f'_{-}(x) = \\mathbf{1}_{x0}$.\n\nThe second derivative of $f(x)$ in the sense of distributions is a Dirac delta measure concentrated at $x=0$, denoted by $\\delta_0$. That is, $f''(dx) = \\delta_0(dx)$. The integral involving the second derivative then becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} L_t^a(Z) \\, f''(da) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} L_t^a(Z) \\, \\delta_0(da) = \\frac{1}{2} L_t^0(Z)\n$$\nThis term accounts for the non-differentiability of $f(x)$ at $x=0$.\n\nSubstituting these components into the Itô-Tanaka formula for $S_t = Z_t$ and $f(x)=x^+$ gives the decomposition for $Z_t^{+}$:\n$$\nZ_t^{+} = Z_0^{+} + \\int_0^t \\mathbf{1}_{Z_s  0} \\, dZ_s + \\frac{1}{2} L_t^0(Z)\n$$\nThis is the specific form of Tanaka's formula for the positive part of a continuous semimartingale.\n\nThe problem provides the dynamics for $Z_t$ as:\n$$\ndZ_t = \\bigl(b_1(X_t) - b_2(Y_t)\\bigr)\\,dt + \\bigl(\\sigma(X_t) - \\sigma(Y_t)\\bigr)\\,dW_t\n$$\nWe now substitute this expression for $dZ_t$ into the integral term of the decomposition of $Z_t^{+}$:\n$$\n\\int_0^t \\mathbf{1}_{Z_s  0} \\, dZ_s = \\int_0^t \\mathbf{1}_{Z_s  0} \\left( \\bigl(b_1(X_s) - b_2(Y_s)\\bigr)\\,ds + \\bigl(\\sigma(X_s) - \\sigma(Y_s)\\bigr)\\,dW_s \\right)\n$$\nBy the linearity of the Itô integral, we can separate this into a Lebesgue integral (the drift part) and a stochastic integral (the diffusion part):\n$$\n\\int_0^t \\mathbf{1}_{Z_s  0} \\, dZ_s = \\int_0^t \\mathbf{1}_{Z_s  0} \\bigl(b_1(X_s) - b_2(Y_s)\\bigr)\\,ds + \\int_0^t \\mathbf{1}_{Z_s  0} \\bigl(\\sigma(X_s) - \\sigma(Y_s)\\bigr)\\,dW_s\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this back into the expression for $Z_t^{+}$ to obtain the complete explicit decomposition.

This is because the diffusion coefficient $\\sigma$ is a constant identical for both SDEs. The resulting equation for $Z_t$ contains only a standard Riemann integral. This implies that for any given sample path $\\omega$ from the underlying probability space, the evolution of $Z_t(\\omega)$ is deterministic, governed by an ordinary differential equation (ODE). The initial condition $Z_0(\\omega) = X_0(\\omega) - Y_0(\\omega)$ is a random variable, but once it is fixed for a given path, the entire trajectory of $Z_t(\\omega)$ is determined.\n\nThe differential form of the equation for $Z_t$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}Z_t}{\\mathrm{d}t} = a\\,Z_t + (b_1 - b_2)\n$$\nwith the initial condition $Z_0 = X_0 - Y_0$.

We can argue this by contradiction. Suppose there exists some time $t  0$ for which $Z_t  0$ on a set of paths with positive probability. For any such path, let $t^*$ be the first time that $Z_t$ becomes positive:\n$$\nt^* = \\inf\\{s  0 : Z_s  0\\}\n$$\nSince $Z_0 \\le 0$ and $Z_t$ is a continuous function of time (as it is the solution to an ODE with continuous coefficients), we must have $Z_{t^*} = 0$. For the function $Z_t$ to become positive at times $t  t^*$, its derivative at $t^*$ must be non-negative, i.e., $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}Z_t}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\Big|_{t=t^*} \\ge 0$.\n\nHowever, from the ODE governing $Z_t$, we can evaluate the derivative at $t=t^*$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}Z_t}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\Big|_{t=t^*} = a\\,Z_{t^*} + (b_1 - b_2)\n$$\nSubstituting $Z_{t^*} = 0$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}Z_t}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\Big|_{t=t^*} = a \\cdot 0 + (b_1 - b_2) = b_1 - b_2\n$$\nFrom the problem's assumption, we have $b_1 \\le b_2$, which implies $b_1 - b_2 \\le 0$. Thus, we have shown that\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}Z_t}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\Big|_{t=t^*} \\le 0\n$$\nThis contradicts the condition $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}Z_t}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\Big|_{t=t^*} \\ge 0$ unless the derivative is exactly zero, which occurs if and only if $b_1 = b_2$. If $b_1  b_2$, the derivative is strictly negative, so it's impossible for $Z_t$ to increase from $0$. If $b_1 = b_2$, the derivative at $Z_t=0$ is $0$. The ODE becomes $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}Z_t}{\\mathrm{d}t} = aZ_t$ with solution $Z_t = Z_0 \\exp(at)$. Since $Z_0 \\le 0$, $Z_t$ will remain non-positive for all $t \\ge 0$.\nIn all cases, a path starting with $Z_0 \\le 0$ cannot become positive. Therefore, the initial assumption that $Z_t  0$ for some $t$ must be false.\n\nWe conclude that $Z_t \\le 0$ for all $t \\ge 0$ almost surely.\nThis means $X_t - Y_t \\le 0$ almost surely for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\nThe quantity we need to compute is $\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[(X_t - Y_t)^+\\right]$.

The initial condition for $D_t$ is $D_0 = X_0 - Y_0 = 0 - 0 = 0$.\nThe differential of $D_t$ is given by the difference of the differentials of $X_t$ and $Y_t$. Since the SDEs are linear, we can write:\n$$\ndD_t = d(X_t - Y_t) = dX_t - dY_t\n$$\nSubstituting the given expressions for $dX_t$ and $dY_t$:\n$$\ndD_t = (\\mu\\,dt + dW_t) - (-\\mu\\,dt + dW_t)\n$$\nWe can separate the drift ($dt$) and diffusion ($dW_t$) terms:\n$$\ndD_t = (\\mu - (-\\mu))\\,dt + (1 - 1)\\,dW_t\n$$\n$$\ndD_t = 2\\mu\\,dt + 0 \\cdot dW_t\n$$\n$$\ndD_t = 2\\mu\\,dt\n$$\nThis resulting equation for $D_t$ is a simple ordinary differential equation, as the diffusion term has vanished. This is a crucial consequence of the fact that both processes $X_t$ and $Y_t$ are driven by the same Brownian motion $W_t$ and have identical, constant diffusion coefficients $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = 1$.
