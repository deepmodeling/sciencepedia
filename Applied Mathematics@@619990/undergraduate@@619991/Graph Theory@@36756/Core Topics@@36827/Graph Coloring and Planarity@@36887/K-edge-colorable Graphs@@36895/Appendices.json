During any single time slot, a set of links can be active simultaneously, with the constraint that any node can only participate in one active link at a time. For maximum throughput, the system is designed to operate in \"full utilization\" rounds, where every node is involved in exactly one communication. Such a set of active links is formally known as a 1-factor or a perfect matching.\n\nThe network manager wants to create a complete schedule that partitions all available links into a sequence of disjoint full utilization rounds.
