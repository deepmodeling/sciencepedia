For any simple planar graph with $v$ vertices and $e$ edges, it must be true that $e \\le 3v - 6$. This exercise provides a hands-on application of this powerful first-line test, framing it within a practical engineering scenario to determine the physical limits of a microchip design. By working through this problem, you will see how a straightforward calculation can quickly rule out certain graph structures as non-planar [@problem_id:1527797].", "problem": "A team of engineers is designing a microchip that contains 6 crucial processing units. For the chip to function reliably, each processing unit must have a direct communication link (a wire) to at least $k$ other distinct units, where $k$ is an integer representing the minimum connectivity. The entire design must be fabricated on a single flat layer, meaning that no two wires are allowed to cross each other.\n\nThe engineers want to determine the limits of their design. A planar graph can model the layout, where processing units are vertices and wires are edges. Based on graph-theoretic constraints for planarity, there is a maximum integer value for the minimum connectivity $k$ for which such a planar chip design *might* be possible. If the connectivity requirement $k$ is set any higher than this maximum value, it becomes physically impossible to create the chip layout without wires crossing.\n\nWhat is this maximum possible integer value for the minimum connectivity $k$?", "solution": "Model the chip as a simple planar graph with $n=6$ vertices and $e$ edges.
