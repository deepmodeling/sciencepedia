This exercise provides direct, hands-on practice by guiding you through the process of contracting edges in the well-known Petersen graph. By performing these contractions, you'll uncover a complete graph $K_5$ as a minor, a classic result that illustrates how complex structures can be simplified to reveal their essential non-planar core [@problem_id:1554462].", "problem": "In graph theory, the Petersen graph is a well-known structure with interesting properties. Let's define the Petersen graph, $P$, using a common construction. Its set of 10 vertices is partitioned into two sets: an \"outer\" set $V_{out} = \\{v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\\}$ and an \"inner\" set $V_{in} = \\{u_0, u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4\\}$. The 15 edges of the graph are defined as follows, where all indices are considered modulo 5:\n1.  **Outer edges**: An edge exists between $v_i$ and $v_{i+1}$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. These form a 5-cycle.\n2.  **Spoke edges**: An edge exists between $v_i$ and $u_i$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n3.  **Inner edges**: An edge exists between $u_i$ and $u_{i+2}$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. These form a 5-pointed star.\n\nAn important operation in graph theory is edge contraction. When an edge $(a,b)$ is contracted, the two vertices $a$ and $b$ are merged into a single new vertex, let's call it $w$. This new vertex $w$ is connected to every vertex that was a neighbor of either $a$ or $b$ (except for $a$ and $b$ themselves). The resulting graph is simplified, meaning if multiple edges form between the same two vertices as a result of the contraction, they are considered a single edge.\n\nConsider the graph $P'$ that results from contracting all five \"spoke\" edges of the Petersen graph, i.e., the set of edges $\\{(v_0, u_0), (v_1, u_1), (v_2, u_2), (v_3, u_3), (v_4, u_4)\\}$. This operation produces a new graph with 5 vertices.\n\nDetermine the total number of edges in the resulting graph $P'$.", "solution": "Define the contraction map $f$ from the vertex set of $P$ to the vertex set of $P'$ by $f(v_{i})=f(u_{i})=w_{i}$ for $i \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$, so $P'$ has vertices $\\{w_{0},w_{1},w_{2},w_{3},w_{4}\\}$. By the definition of edge contraction in simple graphs, for each edge $(x,y)$ of $P$ with $f(x) \\neq f(y)$, there is a single edge between $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ in $P'$; loops are discarded and parallel edges are simplified to a single edge.\n\nEnumerate the images of the three edge families of $P$ under $f$:\n1. Outer edges: Each edge $(v_{i},v_{i+1})$ maps to $(w_{i},w_{i+1})$. These yield the set $\\{\\{w_{i},w_{i+1}\\} : i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{5}\\}$, consisting of $5$ distinct unordered pairs.\n2. Spoke edges: Each edge $(v_{i},u_{i})$ maps to a loop at $w_{i}$, which is discarded in the contraction. Hence they contribute no edges to $P'$.\n3. Inner edges: Each edge $(u_{i},u_{i+2})$ maps to $(w_{i},w_{i+2})$. These yield the set $\\{\\{w_{i},w_{i+2}\\} : i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{5}\\}$, consisting of $5$ distinct unordered pairs.\n\nWe verify there are no duplications between the two families that survive:\n- Distinctness within each family holds since $\\{\\{i,i+1\\} : i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{5}\\}$ and $\\{\\{i,i+2\\} : i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{5}\\}$ are $5$-element sets of unordered pairs.\n- No outer edge coincides with an inner edge: if $\\{i,i+1\\}=\\{j,j+2\\}$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_{5}$, then either $i=j$ and $i+1=j+2$, which implies $1\\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$ (impossible), or $i=j+2$ and $i+1=j$, which implies $1\\equiv -2 \\pmod{5}$, i.e., $3\\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ (also impossible). Hence the two families are disjoint.\n\nTherefore $P'$ has exactly $5+5=10$ edges. Equivalently, each $w_{i}$ is adjacent to $w_{i\\pm 1}$ and $w_{i\\pm 2}$, so $P'$ is isomorphic to the complete graph $K_{5}$, which has $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ edges.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10}$$", "id": "1554462"}, {"introduction": "A common point of confusion is the distinction between a subgraph and a minor, a difference that is critical for correctly applying Wagner's and Kuratowski's theorems.

Hence it is non-planar but violates the “contains neither $K_{5}$ nor $K_{3,3}$ as a subgraph” condition. So C is not acceptable.\n\nOption D: The edges among $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ form all $\\binom{5}{2}$ pairs, i.e., the induced subgraph on $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ is $K_{5}$. Hence it contains $K_{5}$ as a subgraph, violating the condition. So D is not acceptable.\n\nOption B: The graph is two disjoint triangles $\\{1,2,3\\}$ and $\\{4,5,6\\}$ with a perfect matching $(1,4),(2,5),(3,6)$ between them. This is the triangular prism graph, which is planar. An explicit planar drawing exists: draw triangle $(1,2,3)$ as a large triangle, draw triangle $(4,5,6)$ strictly inside it, and connect $1$ to $4$, $2$ to $5$, and $3$ to $6$ with pairwise non-crossing curves inside the outer triangle; none of these edges cross each other or the inner triangle, so the graph is planar. Therefore B does not satisfy the non-planarity requirement.\n\nOption A: We verify it is non-planar but contains neither $K_{5}$ nor $K_{3,3}$ as a subgraph.\n\n1) Absence of a $K_{5}$ subgraph:\n- Vertex $6$ has degree $2$ (it is adjacent only to $4$ and $5$), so any 5-vertex set that includes $6$ cannot induce a $K_{5}$ subgraph because a $K_{5}$ requires every chosen vertex to be adjacent to the other 4 vertices.\n- The only 5-vertex set excluding $6$ is $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$. Among these, edge $(4,5)$ is missing, so the subgraph on $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ is not $K_{5}$.\nTherefore, the graph has no $K_{5}$ subgraph.\n\n2) Absence of a $K_{3,3}$ subgraph:\n- Any subgraph isomorphic to $K_{3,3}$ uses exactly 6 vertices. Since the host graph has exactly 6 vertices, such a subgraph would have to use all vertices, including vertex $6$.\n- In $K_{3,3}$, each vertex has degree $3$ within the subgraph. But in the given graph, vertex $6$ has degree $2$, and a subgraph cannot add edges. Therefore, the graph contains no $K_{3,3}$ subgraph.\n\n3) Non-planarity by containing a subdivision of $K_{5}$:\n- Consider the 5 vertices $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ as the branch vertices. All edges of $K_{5}$ among these are present except $(4,5)$; specifically, edges $(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5),(2,3),(2,4),(2,5),(3,4),(3,5)$ exist.\n- The missing edge $(4,5)$ is replaced by the 2-edge path $4-6-5$, using vertex $6$ to subdivide the edge.\n- Hence the graph contains a subdivision of $K_{5}$ with exactly one edge subdivided. By Kuratowski’s theorem, any graph containing a subdivision of $K_{5}$ is non-planar.\n\nTherefore, Option A is non-planar but contains neither $K_{5}$ nor $K_{3,3}$ as a subgraph.\n\nThus, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1554460"}, {"introduction": "Having grasped the definition and significance of minors, you can now wield them as a powerful analytical tool.

A minor $H$ of $G$ satisfies $|V(H)| \\leq |V(G)|$ because deletions and contractions do not increase the number of vertices. Hence $K_{3,3}$ (which has $6$ vertices) cannot be a minor of $G$. For a $K_{5}$ minor on a $5$-vertex graph, no edge contraction is possible (any contraction would reduce the vertex count below $5$), so a $K_{5}$ minor would require a $K_{5}$ subgraph. However, in $K_{1,3,1}$ the three vertices of $V_{2}$ are mutually nonadjacent, so the graph lacks the three edges among them and cannot contain $K_{5}$. Therefore $K_{1,3,1}$ has neither a $K_{5}$ nor a $K_{3,3}$ minor and is planar.\n\nFinally, for $n=0$, $G=K_{1,3,0}$ is the star $K_{1,3}$, which is a tree on $4$ vertices and therefore planar.
