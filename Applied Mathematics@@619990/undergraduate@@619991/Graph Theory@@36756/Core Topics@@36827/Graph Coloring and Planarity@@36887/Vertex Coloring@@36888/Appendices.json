This first practice exercise grounds the concept of chromatic number in a tangible scheduling scenario. By translating committee and team conflicts into a graph, you will determine the minimum number of time slots needed, which corresponds precisely to the graph's chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$. This problem will give you hands-on experience in modeling practical situations and applying coloring concepts to well-known graph families like cycles and complete graphs [@problem_id:1553035].", "problem": "A university department needs to schedule meetings for two separate working groups. The time slots for meetings are identical for both groups, but no individual can be in two meetings at once. The goal is to determine the minimum total number of time slots required for all meetings to take place.\n\nThe first working group consists of five committees: {A, B, C, D, E}. Due to overlapping membership, some pairs of committees cannot meet at the same time. The specific conflicts are as follows:\n- Committee A conflicts with B and E.\n- Committee B conflicts with A and C.\n- Committee C conflicts with B and D.\n- Committee D conflicts with C and E.\n- Committee E conflicts with D and A.\n\nThe second working group is a special task force composed of four project teams: {$P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$}. In this group, the work is so intertwined that every project team has a scheduling conflict with every other project team.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of distinct time slots required to schedule all the meetings for both the working group and the task force?", "solution": "Model each working group as a simple graph whose vertices are the meetings and whose edges connect pairs that cannot be held simultaneously. The minimum number of time slots equals the chromatic number of the graph, denoted $\\chi(\\cdot)$.\n\nFor the first working group, the committees are $\\{A,B,C,D,E\\}$ with conflicts $A\\!\\!-\\!\\!B$, $B\\!\\!-\\!\\!C$, $C\\!\\!-\\!\\!D$, $D\\!\\!-\\!\\!E$, $E\\!\\!-\\!\\!A$. This is exactly the cycle graph $C_5$. A graph is $2$-colorable if and only if it is bipartite, which holds if and only if it has no odd cycle. Since $C_5$ is an odd cycle, it is not $2$-colorable, hence $\\chi(C_5) \\ge 3$. A $3$-coloring exists; for example, assign colors along the cycle as $A=1$, $B=2$, $C=3$, $D=1$, $E=2$, which respects all conflicts. Therefore,\n$$\n\\chi(\\text{working group})=\\chi(C_5)=3\n$$\n\nFor the second working group (task force), the teams {$P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$} have all-pairs conflicts, forming the complete graph $K_4$. In $K_n$, every pair of distinct vertices is adjacent, so at least $n$ colors are needed; assigning distinct colors to each vertex achieves this. Hence,\n$$\n\\chi(\\text{task force})=\\chi(K_4)=4\n$$\n\nSince the two groups use the same set of time slots and there are no cross-group conflict constraints specified, the total number of distinct time slots needed to schedule all meetings is the maximum of the two chromatic numbers. Let $m$ denote this minimum total. Then\n$$\nm=\\max\\{\\chi(C_5),\\chi(K_4)\\}=\\max\\{3,4\\}=4\n$$\nThus the minimum number of distinct time slots required is $4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "1553035"}, {"introduction": "Now that you've seen how vertex coloring can solve problems, you might ask: how do we actually find a coloring for a general graph? While finding the absolute minimum number of colors (the chromatic number) is a famously difficult computational problem, we can use practical algorithms to find a valid coloring efficiently. This exercise introduces a classic greedy method, the Welsh-Powell algorithm, which provides a systematic procedure for coloring any graph [@problem_id:1552998]. Following this algorithm will not only yield a proper coloring but also build your intuition for algorithmic problem-solving in graph theory.", "problem": "Consider an undirected graph $G$ defined by a vertex set $V$ and an edge set $E$.

The procedure for the algorithm is as follows:\n1.  List all vertices in descending order of their degree.\n2.  In case of a tie in degree between two or more vertices, list them in alphabetical order.\n3.  Assign the first color to the first vertex in the list and then, in sequence, assign the same color to every subsequent vertex in the list that is not adjacent to any previously colored vertex in this step.\n4.  Move to the next uncolored vertex in the original ordered list and assign the second color to it. Repeat the process of coloring other uncolored vertices with this second color.\n5.  Continue this process with new colors until all vertices are colored.\n\nWhat is the total number of distinct colors used by this specific application of the Welsh-Powell algorithm to color the graph $G$?", "solution": "We first compute the degree of each vertex from the edge set $E=\\{\\{A,B\\}, \\{A,C\\}, \\{A,D\\}, \\{A,E\\}, \\{B,C\\}, \\{B,D\\}, \\{B,F\\}, \\{C,E\\}, \\{D,F\\}\\}$.\n\nThe adjacency relations are:\n- $A$ is adjacent to $B,C,D,E$, so $\\deg(A)=4$.\n- $B$ is adjacent to $A,C,D,F$, so $\\deg(B)=4$.\n- $C$ is adjacent to $A,B,E$, so $\\deg(C)=3$.\n- $D$ is adjacent to $A,B,F$, so $\\deg(D)=3$.\n- $E$ is adjacent to $A,C$, so $\\deg(E)=2$.\n- $F$ is adjacent to $B,D$, so $\\deg(F)=2$.\n\nOrder the vertices in nonincreasing degree, breaking ties alphabetically: $A,B,C,D,E,F$.\n\nApply the Welsh-Powell coloring:\n- Color $c_1$: Start with $A$ and assign $c_1$ to $A$. Proceed through the list; a vertex can receive $c_1$ if it is not adjacent to any vertex already colored $c_1$. Vertices $B,C,D,E$ are each adjacent to $A$, so they cannot receive $c_1$. Vertex $F$ is not adjacent to $A$, so assign $c_1$ to $F$. After this step: $A,F$ have color $c_1$.\n- Color $c_2$: The next uncolored vertex in the ordered list is $B$. Assign $c_2$ to $B$. Proceed through the list; a vertex can receive $c_2$ if it is not adjacent to any vertex already colored $c_2$ (currently $B$). Vertex $C$ is adjacent to $B$, so it cannot receive $c_2$. Vertex $D$ is adjacent to $B$, so it cannot receive $c_2$. Vertex $E$ is not adjacent to $B$, so assign $c_2$ to $E$. After this step: $B,E$ have color $c_2$.\n- Color $c_3$: The next uncolored vertex is $C$. Assign $c_3$ to $C$.

This final practice challenges that very idea, pushing for a deeper understanding of what truly drives a graph's chromatic number. You are tasked with designing a network that requires three colors but is explicitly \"triangle-free,\" meaning it contains no complete subgraph on three vertices, $K_3$. This exercise [@problem_id:1552993] brilliantly illustrates that the presence of odd cycles, not just cliques, is a fundamental reason a graph may not be 2-colorable, elevating your understanding from simple rules to core structural principles.", "problem": "An amusement park designer is creating a transportation network for 8 new themed zones, labeled $Z_0, Z_1, \\ldots, Z_7$. The transportation consists of direct monorail links between certain pairs of zones. The final network design must satisfy two critical constraints:\n\n1.  **Triangle-Free Constraint**: For any set of three distinct zones, it is not possible for all three to be mutually connected by monorail links.\n2.  **Coloring Constraint**: It must be impossible to assign each zone one of two 'access-pass' colors (e.g., Gold or Silver) such that any two zones connected by a link have different colors. However, it must be possible to achieve this with three colors (e.g., Gold, Silver, and Platinum).\n\nWhich of the following network designs, described by their monorail links, satisfies both constraints?\n\nA. A 'Ring' network: Links exist between $Z_i$ and $Z_{i+1 \\pmod{8}}$ for all $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, 7\\}$.\n\nB.

There are no links connecting any pair of zones from the set $\\{Z_1, Z_2, \\ldots, Z_7\\}$.\n\nC. A 'Cube' network: The zones correspond to the vertices of a cube.

The Triangle-Free Constraint means the graph contains no $C_3$ (no $3$-cliques). The Coloring Constraint requires that the graph is not $2$-colorable (i.e., not bipartite), but is $3$-colorable; equivalently, by the bipartite characterization, the graph must contain an odd cycle and have chromatic number $\\chi(G)=3$.\n\nWe check each option:\n\nA. Ring network is $C_8$. Since $C_8$ has no $3$-cycles, it is triangle-free. However, $C_8$ is an even cycle, so it is bipartite and hence $2$-colorable. This violates the Coloring Constraint. Therefore A fails.\n\nB. Star network is $K_{1,7}$. This graph has no triangles, so it is triangle-free. It is bipartite by definition (partition the center and the leaves), so it is $2$-colorable. This violates the Coloring Constraint. Therefore B fails.\n\nC. Cube network is the $3$-cube $Q_3$. Vertices can be partitioned by parity of Hamming weight; every edge connects opposite parity, so $Q_3$ is bipartite and hence $2$-colorable. Being bipartite implies triangle-free. This violates the Coloring Constraint. Therefore C fails.\n\nD. Cross-Connected Ring is $C_8$ plus the chord ($Z_0,Z_4$). First, it is triangle-free: $C_8$ has no triangles, and adding edge ($Z_0,Z_4$) could only create a triangle if there were a path of length $2$ between $Z_0$ and $Z_4$ in $C_8$, but all $Z_0$–$Z_4$ paths in $C_8$ have length $4$. Second, it is not $2$-colorable because it contains an odd cycle: $Z_0-Z_4-Z_5-Z_6-Z_7-Z_0$ is a $5$-cycle. Finally, it is $3$-colorable; for instance, assign colors $\\{A,B,C\\}$ as follows:\n$Z_0 \\mapsto A$, $Z_1 \\mapsto B$, $Z_7 \\mapsto B$, $Z_4 \\mapsto C$, then along the paths $Z_1-Z_2-Z_3-Z_4$ use $Z_2 \\mapsto A$, $Z_3 \\mapsto B$, and along $Z_7-Z_6-Z_5-Z_4$ use $Z_6 \\mapsto A$, $Z_5 \\mapsto B$. Adjacent vertices receive different colors, so a proper $3$-coloring exists and $\\chi(G)=3$. Therefore D satisfies both constraints.\n\nE. Fragmented network has a component on $\\{Z_0,Z_1,Z_2\\}$ forming $K_3$, which contains a triangle. This violates the Triangle-Free Constraint.
