Place the five vertices in cyclic order on a circle and draw only the edges of the $5$-cycle as the boundary of a convex pentagon. No edges cross, and all vertices lie on the boundary of the unbounded face, so the drawing is outerplanar.\n\nB. Take the circular order $v_{1}, v_{2}, v_{3}, v_{4}, v_{5}$. Draw $(v_{1},v_{2}), (v_{2},v_{3}), (v_{3},v_{4})$ along the boundary between consecutive vertices. Draw the star edges $(v_{5},v_{i})$ for $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$ as straight diagonals from $v_{5}$ to each $v_{i}$. These diagonals share the common endpoint $v_{5}$ and therefore do not cross each other, and in a convex polygon a diagonal does not cross any boundary edge except at a common endpoint. Hence there is a planar drawing with all vertices on the boundary of the outer face, so the graph is outerplanar. Moreover, it contains no subdivision of $K_{4}$ because a subdivision of $K_{4}$ requires four branch vertices of degree at least $3$, while this graph has only three vertices of degree at least $3$.\n\nC.

Draw the chord $(v_{1},v_{3})$ as the single diagonal from $v_{1}$ to $v_{3}$. A single diagonal does not cross any boundary edge except at endpoints.

Label the outer $6$-cycle $1,2,3,4,5,6$ and add the three noncrossing diagonals $(1,3)$, $(3,5)$, $(5,1)$. All bounded faces are triangles, so the graph is maximal outerplanar. The degrees are $\\deg(1)=\\deg(3)=\\deg(5)=4$ and $\\deg(2)=\\deg(4)=\\deg(6)=2$, so there is no vertex of degree $5$. Hence C is false.\n\nFor statement D (minimum degree is $3$), note that in any triangulation of an $n$-gon there are at least two ears (triangles using two boundary edges), which correspond to vertices of degree $2$. In particular, the example above has three vertices of degree $2$. Hence the minimum degree need not be $3$, so D is false.\n\nFor statement E (not $2$-connected), observe that maximal outerplanar graphs on $n \\ge 3$ vertices are $2$-connected; equivalently, they contain a Hamiltonian outer cycle through all vertices, so removing any single vertex leaves the remaining vertices connected via the path along the outer cycle.
