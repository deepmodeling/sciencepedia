This exercise explores a fundamental counting principle known as the \"face-handshaking lemma.\" By understanding this relationship, you'll gain a powerful tool for analyzing planar graphs, starting with a direct link between the local geometry of faces and the total number of edges in the graph [@problem_id:1492298].", "problem": "An urban planner is analyzing the layout of a new city district. The layout is represented as a connected planar graph where vertices are intersections and edges are roads. The drawing of this graph on a map partitions the plane into distinct regions, called faces (this includes the unbounded region surrounding the entire district). The \"degree of a face\" is defined as the number of road segments (edges) forming its boundary. An edge that does not separate two distinct faces (known as a bridge) is counted twice in the degree of the face it borders.\n\nThe proposed design for the district consists of 8 intersections and 11 distinct road segments. Your task is to calculate the sum of the degrees of all faces in this graph representation of the district.", "solution": "Let the connected planar graph have $V=8$ vertices and $E=11$ edges. The drawing partitions the plane into faces, including the unbounded face. By the face-handshaking lemma for planar embeddings, the sum of the degrees of all faces equals twice the number of edges, because each edge contributes exactly $2$ to the total: for an edge separating two distinct faces it contributes $1$ to each, and for a bridge it is counted twice in the boundary of the same face, as specified.\n\nDenote the sum of the degrees of all faces by $S$. Then\n$$\nS=\\sum_{\\text{faces } f}\\deg(f)=2E.\n$$\nSubstituting $E=11$ gives\n$$\nS=2\\cdot 11=22.\n$$\nFor completeness, Euler's formula for a connected planar graph, $V-E+F=2$, yields\n$$\nF=2-V+E=2-8+11=5,\n$$\nwhich is consistent with the above, since the average face degree would be $\\frac{S}{F}=\\frac{22}{5}$, while only the total $S$ is required.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the degrees of all faces is $22$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{22}$$", "id": "1492298"}, {"introduction": "Leonhard Euler's formula, $V - E + F = 2$, is a cornerstone of graph theory, revealing a beautiful, hidden relationship between the vertices, edges, and faces of any connected planar graph. However, what happens when a graph is not connected? This practice investigates the generalized form of Euler's formula, which accounts for graphs composed of multiple separate components, a common scenario in real-world networks [@problem_id:1368115].", "problem": "An urban planning committee is analyzing a schematic for a new automated transport network. The network is laid out on a 2D map. It consists of a set of stations and direct, non-intersecting transport links connecting pairs of stations. The layout has 15 distinct stations and 20 transport links. The presence of these links on the map divides the city plane into 8 separate, enclosed districts, including the unbounded area outside the entire network. A key requirement for the network is full connectivity, meaning a passenger should be able to travel from any station to any other station. The transport network is composed of one or more subnetworks, where each subnetwork is a connected group of stations and links, but there are no links between different subnetworks. Determine the total number of separate subnetworks in the proposed design.", "solution": "Let $V$ be the number of stations, $E$ the number of transport links, $F$ the number of faces (districts) including the unbounded exterior, and $c$ the number of connected components (separate subnetworks).
