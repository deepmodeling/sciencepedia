If $\\chi'(G)=\\Delta(G)=k$, then there exists a proper edge $k$-coloring. In such a coloring, each vertex is incident to exactly $k$ edges and adjacent edges receive distinct colors, so at each vertex the $k$ incident edges must use all $k$ colors exactly once. Therefore, for each color $i$ (with $1 \\leq i \\leq k$), the set of edges of color $i$ meets every vertex exactly once, i.e., it forms a perfect matching (a $1$-factor). Hence a $k$-edge-coloring of a $k$-regular graph decomposes $E(G)$ into $k$ disjoint perfect matchings, which is only possible if $n$ is even.\n\nConsequently, if $n$ is odd and $G$ is $k$-regular, then $G$ cannot be Class 1 (since a perfect matching cannot cover an odd number of vertices), so $\\chi'(G) \\neq k$.

Vizing's theorem states that for any simple graph $G$ with maximum vertex degree $\\Delta(G)$, the edge chromatic number is either $\\Delta(G)$ or $\\Delta(G)+1$.

Removing $e$ splits $G$ into two connected components $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ with vertex counts $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$, where $n_{1}+n_{2}=n$. In $G_{i}$, exactly one vertex (the endpoint of $e$ in $G_{i}$) has degree $2$, and all other vertices have degree $3$. Let $m_{i}$ be the number of edges in $G_{i}$. Then the degree-sum identity in $G_{i}$ gives\n$$\n2m_{i} = \\big(3(n_{i}-1)\\big) + 2 = 3n_{i} - 1.\n$$\nThus $3n_{i} - 1$ is even, which implies $n_{i}$ is odd for $i=1,2$. Therefore both components have an odd number of vertices, and hence $n = n_{1} + n_{2}$ is even as already observed.\n\nWe now find the minimal possible $n$. Since each $n_{i}$ is odd, try the smallest odd sizes. The case $n_{i}=1$ is impossible (no edges, but the special vertex would need degree $2$). The case $n_{i}=3$ is also impossible in a simple graph because it would require vertices of degree $3$ on $3$ vertices, while the maximum degree possible is $2$. Hence $n_{i} \\geq 5$, so\n$$\nn \\geq 5 + 5 = 10.\n$$\nWe next show that $n=10$ is achievable. Construct a $5$-vertex connected simple graph $H$ with one vertex of degree $2$ and the other four of degree $3$.

Take two disjoint copies $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ and add a single edge joining the two degree-$2$ vertices (one from each copy). In the resulting graph, every vertex has degree $3$, the added edge is a bridge, and the graph is simple and connected with $10$ vertices. Therefore the minimum is\n$$\nN=10.\n$$\n\nFinally, determine the Vizing class. Here $\\Delta(G)=3$, so by Vizing's theorem $\\chi'(G) \\in \\{3,4\\}$. We show that $\\chi'(G) \\neq 3$ for any $3$-regular graph with a bridge. Suppose, for contradiction, that a proper $3$-edge-coloring exists. Then each color class is a perfect matching. Let $e=uv$ be the bridge and let $X$ be the vertex set of one component of $G-e$. For any perfect matching $M$,\n$$\n|\\delta(X) \\cap M| \\equiv |X| \\pmod{2}.\n$$\nAs shown above, $|X|=n_{1}$ is odd, so each perfect matching must cross the cut $\\delta(X)$ in an odd number of edges.
