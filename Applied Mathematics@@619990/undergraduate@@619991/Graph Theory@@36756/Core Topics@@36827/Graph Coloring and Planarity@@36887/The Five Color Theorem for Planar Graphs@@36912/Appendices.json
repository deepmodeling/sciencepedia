The graph has a set of six vertices labeled $v_1$, $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$, $v_5$, and $v_c$. The edges of the graph are defined as follows:\n1.  The vertices $v_1$, $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$, $v_5$ form a cycle. That is, for $i=1, \\dots, 4$, an edge exists between $v_i$ and $v_{i+1}$. Additionally, an edge exists between $v_5$ and $v_1$.\n2.  The vertex $v_c$ acts as a central hub, connected by an edge to each of the other five vertices, $v_1$, $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$, and $v_5$.\n\nThis graph is known to be planar. What is the chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, of this graph $G$?", "solution": "Let $G$ be the described graph with vertices $v_{1},v_{2},v_{3},v_{4},v_{5}$ forming a cycle and a central vertex $v_{c}$ adjacent to each $v_{i}$. This is the wheel graph on six vertices, often denoted $W_{6}$, whose rim is the cycle $C_{5}$.\n\nFirst, consider the rim $C_{5}$. It is a standard fact that for a cycle $C_{m}$,\n$$\n\\chi(C_{m})=\\begin{cases}\n2, & \\text{if } m \\text{ is even},\\\\\n3, & \\text{if } m \\text{ is odd}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nSince $5$ is odd, we have $\\chi(C_{5})=3$. Therefore, in any proper coloring of $G$, the vertices $v_{1},\\dots,v_{5}$ must use at least three distinct colors.\n\nNext, $v_{c}$ is adjacent to each of $v_{1},\\dots,v_{5}$. Hence $v_{c}$ must receive a color distinct from every color that appears on the rim. Because the rim requires at least three distinct colors, $v_{c}$ cannot use any of those three, so at least a fourth color is necessary. Thus,\n$$\n\\chi(G)\\geq 4.\n$$\n\nTo show this lower bound is tight, we provide an explicit $4$-coloring. Let the available colors be $c_{1},c_{2},c_{3},c_{4}$. Color the rim by\n$$\nv_{1}\\mapsto c_{1},\\quad v_{2}\\mapsto c_{2},\\quad v_{3}\\mapsto c_{3},\\quad v_{4}\\mapsto c_{1},\\quad v_{5}\\mapsto c_{2},\n$$\nwhich is proper on the cycle $v_{1}v_{2}v_{3}v_{4}v_{5}v_{1}$. Then color the center by\n$$\nv_{c}\\mapsto c_{4}.\n$$\nSince $v_{c}$ is adjacent only to vertices colored $c_{1},c_{2},c_{3}$, assigning $c_{4}$ yields a proper coloring of $G$ using exactly four colors.

This practice places you in a critical step of that algorithm, where a clever recoloring technique known as a Kempe chain argument must be used to resolve a color conflict. By working through this process [@problem_id:1541320], you will gain hands-on experience with the powerful logic at the heart of the theorem.", "problem": "A computer scientist is implementing a recursive algorithm to find a valid 5-coloring for any given planar graph. The algorithm is based directly on the constructive proof of the Five-Color Theorem. It uses the set of colors $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\n\nThe algorithm is currently at a specific step: it has just finished a recursive call that produced a valid 5-coloring for a subgraph $G'$, and now it must determine the color for a single remaining vertex, $v$. The subgraph $G'$ was formed by removing $v$ from a larger graph $G$, so $G' = G - \\{v\\}$.\n\nYou are given the following facts about this specific state of the algorithm:\n1.  In the full graph $G$, the vertex $v$ has exactly five neighbors, which we will label $n_1$, $n_2$, $n_3$, $n_4$, $n_5$.\n2.  The neighbors of $v$ are arranged in a cycle around it in the planar embedding, in the order ($n_1$, $n_2$, $n_3$, $n_4$, $n_5$). This means $n_1$ is not adjacent to $n_3$, and $n_2$ is not adjacent to $n_4$.\n3.  The recursive call has assigned colors to all vertices in $G'$, and the five neighbors of $v$ have received five distinct colors: vertex $n_1$ is colored 1, $n_2$ is colored 2, $n_3$ is colored 3, $n_4$ is colored 4, and $n_5$ is colored 5.\n4.  In graph $G'$, there exists a path between vertices $n_1$ and $n_3$ that consists entirely of vertices colored with either 1 or 3. This path is known as a Kempe chain.\n\nThe algorithm now follows a deterministic procedure to free up a color for $v$:\n- **Procedure Step 1:** It first attempts to free up color 1. It examines the subgraph of $G'$ induced by vertices colored 1 and 3. Because it is given that $n_1$ and $n_3$ are connected by a Kempe chain of these colors, a simple color swap is blocked. This attempt fails.\n- **Procedure Step 2:** Since the first attempt failed, the algorithm proceeds to its second (and in this case, final) option. It attempts to free up color 2. It examines the subgraph of $G'$ induced by vertices colored 2 and 4. The Five-Color Theorem guarantees that since the 1-3 chain connected $n_1$ and $n_3$, the 2-4 chain cannot connect $n_2$ and $n_4$. The algorithm will perform a color swap on the Kempe chain containing $n_2$.\n\nGiven this procedure, what is the final color assigned to vertex $v$?\n\nA) 1\n\nB) 2\n\nC) 3\n\nD) 4\n\nE) 5", "solution": "We consider a planar graph $G$ with a vertex $v$ whose neighbors are $n_{1},n_{2},n_{3},n_{4},n_{5}$ arranged cyclically around $v$ in the planar embedding in the order $(n_{1},n_{2},n_{3},n_{4},n_{5})$. The reduced graph is $G' = G - \\{v\\}$. The recursive step provides a valid $5$-coloring of $G'$ using the color set $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$, with $n_{1},n_{2},n_{3},n_{4},n_{5}$ colored $1,2,3,4,5$ respectively, and there exists a Kempe chain in the subgraph of $G'$ induced by colors $1$ and $3$ connecting $n_{1}$ to $n_{3}$.\n\nAttempt to free color $1$: Consider the induced subgraph $H_{1,3}$ on vertices of colors $1$ and $3$. By assumption, $n_{1}$ and $n_{3}$ lie in the same connected component of $H_{1,3}$ via a Kempe chain. Swapping colors $1$ and $3$ on that component maps $n_{1}$ to color $3$ and $n_{3}$ to color $1$, leaving the neighbor multiset of colors around $v$ still containing both colors $1$ and $3$. Therefore, color $1$ is not removed from the set of colors appearing on neighbors of $v$, so color $1$ cannot be assigned to $v$ at this step.\n\nAttempt to free color $2$: Consider the induced subgraph $H_{2,4}$ on vertices of colors $2$ and $4$. By planarity and the cyclic order $(n_{1},n_{2},n_{3},n_{4},n_{5})$ around $v$, the existence of a $1$-$3$ Kempe chain joining $n_{1}$ to $n_{3}$ implies that $n_{2}$ and $n_{4}$ lie in different connected components of $H_{2,4}$; otherwise there would be a $2$-$4$ Kempe chain joining $n_{2}$ and $n_{4}$ that would cross the $1$-$3$ chain together with the edges incident to $v$, contradicting planarity. Therefore, a color swap on the $2$-$4$ Kempe chain component containing $n_{2}$ interchanges colors $2$ and $4$ on that component, changing the color of $n_{2}$ from $2$ to $4$, while $n_{4}$ remains color $4$ because it is in a different component. This swap preserves a valid $5$-coloring of $G'$.\n\nAfter this swap, among the neighbors of $v$ the colors present are $\\{1,3,4,4,5\\}$, so color $2$ no longer appears on any neighbor of $v$. Hence assigning $v$ the color $2$ yields a proper extension of the coloring from $G'$ to $G$.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm assigns $v$ the color $2$, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1541320"}, {"introduction": "Knowing a theorem is one thing, but knowing when to apply it is a crucial skill.

To prevent signal interference, adjacent components in the network must be assigned different operating frequencies. The assignment of frequencies is analogous to vertex coloring in a graph, where components are vertices and a direct connection between two components is an edge. The chromatic number of this graph corresponds to the minimum number of distinct frequencies required.\n\nThe network has the following two properties:\n1.  The layout is planar, meaning it can be drawn on the circuit board without any connections crossing each other.\n2.  The components are of two distinct types: \"transmitters\" and \"receivers\". Every connection in the network links one transmitter to one receiver; there are no connections between two transmitters or between two receivers.\n\nRecalling that the Five Color Theorem guarantees that any planar graph is 5-colorable, the engineer concludes that allocating 5 distinct frequency channels is a safe and potentially necessary choice for complex layouts. They claim that for some very large and intricate networks satisfying these properties, all 5 frequencies might be required.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly evaluates the engineer's conclusion?\n\nA. The engineer is correct. The Five Color Theorem provides the tightest possible upper bound on the number of required frequencies for any planar network.\n\nB. The engineer is incorrect. The Four Color Theorem provides a tighter bound of 4, which is the best possible upper bound for any planar network.\n\nC. The engineer is incorrect. The network structure described is a bipartite graph. Any such graph with at least one connection requires exactly 2 frequencies.\n\nD. The engineer is incorrect. Since the graph contains no triangles, by Grötzsch's theorem, it is 3-colorable. Thus, a maximum of 3 frequencies are needed.\n\nE. The engineer is correct in principle, but 5 is an overly generous allocation.
