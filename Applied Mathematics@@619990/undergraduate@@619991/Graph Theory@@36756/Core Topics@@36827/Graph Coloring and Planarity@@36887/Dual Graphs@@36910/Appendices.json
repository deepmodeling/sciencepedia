By the definition of planar duality for a 2-cell embedding:\n- Each face of $G_{cube}$ becomes a vertex of $G_{dual}$, so\n$$\nV_{d} = F_{c} = 6.\n$$\n- Each edge of $G_{cube}$ separates exactly two faces, inducing exactly one edge between the corresponding dual vertices, so\n$$\nE_{d} = E_{c} = 12.\n$$\n- The degree of a dual vertex equals the number of edges on the boundary of the corresponding primal face. Since each face of a cube is a quadrilateral, every dual vertex has degree $4$. Hence $G_{dual}$ is $4$-regular on $6$ vertices.\n\nUsing Euler’s formula on $G_{dual}$,\n$$\nF_{d} = 2 - V_{d} + E_{d} = 2 - 6 + 12 = 8.\n$$\nBy the face-handshaking lemma (sum of face lengths equals $2E_{d}$),\n$$\n\\sum \\text{(face lengths)} = 2E_{d} = 24.\n$$\nWith $F_{d} = 8$, the average face length is $24/8 = 3$.

This final practice moves into the realm of combinatorial enumeration by exploring the relationship between the spanning trees of a graph and its dual. By analyzing a specific graph composed of parallel paths, you will apply a powerful theorem stating that the number of spanning trees in a planar graph is equal to the number of spanning trees in its dual, showcasing how duality can be a key to solving complex counting problems [@problem_id:1498296].", "problem": "Consider a simple planar graph, denoted by $G$. The graph $G$ is constructed from two distinct vertices, let's call them $u$ and $v$. These two vertices are connected by three paths, $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$, which are vertex-disjoint except at their shared endpoints $u$ and $v$. Let the lengths of these paths, defined as the number of edges in each, be $p_1$, $p_2$, and $p_3$, respectively.

Determine the total number of distinct spanning trees in this dual graph $G^*$.

The number of edges is $m=p_{1}+p_{2}+p_{3}$. The vertex set consists of $u$ and $v$ plus the internal vertices on each path, for a total of\n$$\nn=2+(p_{1}-1)+(p_{2}-1)+(p_{3}-1)=p_{1}+p_{2}+p_{3}-1.\n$$\nA spanning tree on $G$ has $n-1=p_{1}+p_{2}+p_{3}-2$ edges, so from the $m$ edges we must delete exactly $2$ edges to obtain a spanning tree.\n\nWe now characterize which $2$ edges can be deleted without disconnecting $G$ and while breaking all cycles. Since $G$ has three parallel $u$–$v$ routes, any cycle uses edges from exactly two of the three paths. Thus to eliminate all cycles, at most one of the three paths can remain intact; otherwise two intact paths would create a cycle. Moreover, on any path $P_{i}$, deleting more than one edge would split $P_{i}$ into at least three segments, and the middle segment would be disjoint from both $u$ and $v$, hence disconnected from the rest of the graph, which is forbidden in a spanning tree. Therefore, in any spanning tree, exactly one of the three paths remains intact (no deletion on that path), and on each of the other two paths exactly one edge is deleted.\n\nThis structure is also sufficient: if one path, say $P_{i}$, is kept intact, then $u$ and $v$ remain connected through $P_{i}$. Deleting a single edge on each of the other two paths $P_{j}$ and $P_{k}$ splits each into two subpaths, one attached to $u$ and the other to $v$, so all vertices remain connected through $u$ and $v$, and the graph has no cycles because there is only one $u$–$v$ path.\n\nCounting the spanning trees of $G$ therefore proceeds as follows. Choose which path remains intact (three choices). If $P_{i}$ is intact, then on each of the other two paths $P_{j}$ and $P_{k}$ there are $p_{j}$ and $p_{k}$ choices, respectively, for the unique deleted edge.
