This exercise [@problem_id:1528837] demonstrates how duality preserves and reflects the underlying geometry, leading to a surprising and elegant result.

For any such drawing (a planar embedding), its dual graph $G^*$ can be constructed as follows: a vertex is placed inside each face of the original graph $G$ (including the unbounded outer face), and an edge is drawn between two such new vertices if and only if their corresponding faces in $G$ share a boundary edge.\n\nA wheel graph $W_n$ (for an integer $n \\ge 4$) is a simple graph constructed by joining a single central vertex (the hub) to all vertices of a cycle graph on $n-1$ vertices, $C_{n-1}$ (the rim). Thus, $W_n$ has $n$ vertices and $2(n-1)$ edges.\n\nConsider the specific wheel graph $G = W_8$, which consists of a central hub connected to the 7 vertices of a cycle $C_7$.

The dual graph $G^*$ is isomorphic to the original graph $W_8$.\n\nE. The dual graph $G^*$ is a cycle graph.", "solution": "We use standard properties of planar graphs and their duals. For a connected planar embedding, Euler’s formula gives $v-e+f=2$, where $v$ is the number of vertices, $e$ the number of edges, and $f$ the number of faces (including the outer face). For a wheel graph $W_{n}$, we have $v=n$ and $e=2(n-1)$ by definition. Thus\n$$\nf \\;=\\; 2 - v + e \\;=\\; 2 - n + 2(n-1) \\;=\\; n.\n$$\nSpecializing to $W_{8}$, we obtain $f=8$, so the dual $G^{*}$ has $8$ vertices (one per face of $G$). Therefore, any claim that $G^{*}$ has $7$ vertices is false.\n\nIn a planar dual, the number of edges satisfies $e^{*}=e$ when no primal edge is a bridge (since each edge in the embedding separates two faces and corresponds to exactly one dual edge between the corresponding dual vertices). The wheel graph $W_{8}$ has no bridges (it is in fact $3$-connected), so\n$$\ne^{*} \\;=\\; e \\;=\\; 2(8-1) \\;=\\; 14.\n$$\nHence, $G^{*}$ has $14$ edges and $8$ vertices, which rules out the statement that it has $7$ vertices and $14$ edges.\n\nThe degree of a dual vertex equals the number of edges on the boundary of the corresponding face in the primal. In the standard embedding of $W_{8}$ with the hub inside the cycle $C_{7}$:\n- There are $7$ inner triangular faces (each bounded by two spokes and one rim edge), and each such face has boundary length $3$, so the corresponding dual vertices have degree $3$.\n- The outer face is bounded by the $7$ rim edges of $C_{7}$, so its corresponding dual vertex has degree $7$.\n\nTherefore, $G^{*}$ is not $3$-regular, because it has one vertex of degree $7$ and seven vertices of degree $3$.\n\nNext, we analyze the adjacency structure. Two inner triangular faces share a boundary edge exactly when they share a spoke; each such pair of adjacent triangles gives an edge in $G^{*}$. This makes the seven dual vertices corresponding to the inner faces adjacent in a cyclic manner, forming a $7$-cycle. Each inner triangular face also shares its rim edge with the outer face, so each inner dual vertex is adjacent to the dual vertex of the outer face. There are no other adjacencies. This structure is precisely that of the wheel graph on $8$ vertices: a $7$-cycle with an additional central vertex connected to all cycle vertices. Hence $G^{*} \\cong W_{8}$.\n\nFrom the presence of the $7$-cycle on the inner dual vertices, $G^{*}$ contains an odd cycle, so it is not bipartite. Also, because one vertex has degree $7$, $G^{*}$ is not a cycle graph (whose vertices all have degree $2$).\n\nSummarizing:\n- A is false (not $3$-regular).\n- B is false (contains an odd cycle).\n- C is false (it has $8$ vertices, not $7$).\n- D is true ($G^{*} \\cong W_{8}$).\n- E is false (not a cycle graph).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1528837"}, {"introduction": "This final practice challenges you to use the properties of duality as a deductive tool.
