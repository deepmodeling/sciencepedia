This first exercise provides a concrete, constructive approach to see how easily planarity can be broken. Starting with a simple planar graph, the 6-cycle ($C_6$), you will explore how the addition of just three edges can create a non-planar structure by forming the complete bipartite graph $K_{3,3}$, one of the two forbidden subgraphs described by Kuratowski's theorem. This practice is invaluable for developing the skill of recognizing the underlying structure of a $K_{3,3}$ subgraph, which is often disguised within a larger graph [@problem_id:1517540].", "problem": "Consider a simple cycle graph on six vertices, denoted as $C_6$.

Therefore, if we can show that adding a set of edges results in a non-planar graph, it must contain a subdivision of $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$. In this problem, we are specifically looking for a subdivision of $K_{3,3}$. Conversely, if a resulting graph is planar, it cannot contain a subdivision of $K_{3,3}$.\n\nA graph $G$ contains a subdivision of $K_{3,3}$ if we can identify two disjoint sets of three vertices in $G$, let's call them branch vertices $U=\\{u_1, u_2, u_3\\}$ and $W=\\{w_1, w_2, w_3\\}$, and nine paths between each vertex in $U$ and each vertex in $W$, such that these nine paths are internally vertex-disjoint (i.e., any two paths can only share endpoints, which must be branch vertices).\n\nLet's analyze each option. The initial graph $C_6$ has 6 vertices and 6 edges. Adding 3 edges results in a graph with $v=6$ vertices and $e=9$ edges.\n\n**Analysis of Option A: Add edges $\\{(v_1, v_3), (v_3, v_5), (v_5, v_1)\\}$**\nThe resulting graph $G_A$ is the cycle $C_6$ plus a triangle connecting the alternate vertices $\\{v_1, v_3, v_5\\}$. We can provide a planar drawing of this graph. Imagine the vertices $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5, v_6$ arranged in a circle forming a hexagon. The edges of $C_6$ are the sides of this hexagon. The added edges $(v_1, v_3)$, $(v_3, v_5)$, and $(v_5, v_1)$ form a triangle that can be drawn entirely inside the hexagon. Since no edges cross, the graph $G_A$ is planar. By Kuratowski's theorem, it cannot contain a subdivision of $K_{3,3}$.\n\n**Analysis of Option C: Add edges $\\{(v_2, v_4), (v_4, v_6), (v_6, v_2)\\}$**\nThis case is structurally identical (isomorphic) to Option A. It adds a triangle connecting the alternate vertices $\\{v_2, v_4, v_6\\}$. Similar to Option A, this graph, $G_C$, can be drawn with the $C_6$ as an outer hexagon and the added edges forming a triangle inside it. Thus, $G_C$ is planar and does not contain a subdivision of $K_{3,3}$.\n\n**Analysis of Option D: Add edges $\\{(v_1, v_3), (v_2, v_4), (v_3, v_5)\\}$**\nThe resulting graph $G_D$ has the $C_6$ edges plus the chords $(v_1, v_3)$, $(v_2, v_4)$, and $(v_3, v_5)$. We can construct a planar embedding. Draw the vertices $v_1, \\dots, v_6$ in a hexagon. The chords $(v_1, v_3)$ and $(v_3, v_5)$ form a path $v_1-v_3-v_5$. This can be drawn inside the hexagon. The remaining chord $(v_2, v_4)$ can also be drawn inside the hexagon without crossing the path $v_1-v_3-v_5$. Therefore, $G_D$ is planar and cannot contain a subdivision of $K_{3,3}$.\n\n**Analysis of Option B: Add edges $\\{(v_1, v_4), (v_3, v_6), (v_5, v_2)\\}$**\nLet's analyze the structure of the resulting graph, $G_B$. A natural way to partition the vertices of $C_6$ is into two sets: the odd-indexed vertices $U = \\{v_1, v_3, v_5\\}$ and the even-indexed vertices $W = \\{v_2, v_4, v_6\\}$.\nLet's check the connections between vertices in $U$ and vertices in $W$.\nThe original edges of $C_6$ are $(v_i, v_{i+1})$ (with $v_7 = v_1$). These edges always connect an odd-indexed vertex to an even-indexed one. The edges are:\n$(v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3), (v_3, v_4), (v_4, v_5), (v_5, v_6), (v_6, v_1)$.\nThis gives us the connections: $(v_1,v_2)$, $(v_3,v_2)$, $(v_3,v_4)$, $(v_5,v_4)$, $(v_5,v_6)$, $(v_1,v_6)$.\n\nThe added edges are $(v_1, v_4), (v_3, v_6), (v_5, v_2)$. Notice these are the \"long chords\" that also connect vertices from $U$ to vertices in $W$.\n\nLet's list all connections from $U$ to $W$ in the graph $G_B$:\n- From $v_1 \\in U$: to $v_2$ (from $C_6$), to $v_4$ (new), to $v_6$ (from $C_6$). So $v_1$ is connected to all vertices in $W$.\n- From $v_3 \\in U$: to $v_2$ (from $C_6$), to $v_4$ (from $C_6$), to $v_6$ (new). So $v_3$ is connected to all vertices in $W$.\n- From $v_5 \\in U$: to $v_2$ (new), to $v_4$ (from $C_6$), to $v_6$ (from $C_6$). So $v_5$ is connected to all vertices in $W$.\n\nIn the resulting graph $G_B$, every vertex in $U=\\{v_1, v_3, v_5\\}$ is connected by an edge to every vertex in $W=\\{v_2, v_4, v_6\\}$. The original $C_6$ edges ensure there are no edges within $U$ or within $W$, as they connect odd- to even-indexed vertices. The new edges also connect odd- to even-indexed vertices. Thus, there are no edges with both endpoints in $U$ or both in $W$.\nThis structure perfectly matches the definition of the complete bipartite graph $K_{3,3}$ with partitions $U$ and $W$.\n\nA graph is always considered a (trivial) subdivision of itself. Since $G_B$ is the graph $K_{3,3}$, it contains a subdivision of $K_{3,3}$. As $K_{3,3}$ is one of the Kuratowski forbidden subgraphs, it is a non-planar graph.\n\nTherefore, adding the edges in set B creates the graph $K_{3,3}$, which by definition contains a subdivision of $K_{3,3}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1517540"}, {"introduction": "While $K_5$ and $K_{3,3}$ are distinct graphs, they are deeply related in the context of planarity. This exercise explores a fascinating transformation: how constructing a new graph by adding a single \"apex\" vertex to a $K_{3,3}$ results in a graph containing a subdivision of $K_5$. To solve this, you must move beyond simple pattern recognition and engage with the formal definition of a graph subdivision. You will need to strategically select a set of principal vertices and then find the required internally-disjoint paths, demonstrating a non-obvious link between the two Kuratowski subgraphs [@problem_id:1517522].", "problem": "Let $K_{3,3}$ be a complete bipartite graph with vertex partitions $U = \\{u_1, u_2, u_3\\}$ and $V = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$.

Thus, in $G$, every $u \\in U$ is adjacent to every $v \\in V$, there are no edges within $U$ nor within $V$, and $w$ is adjacent to all six of $u_1,u_2,u_3,v_1,v_2,v_3$.

Therefore, a necessary condition is that the number of nonadjacent pairs inside $S$ is at most $2$, because each nonadjacent pair requires at least one distinct internal vertex. We will enumerate, for each option, the number of nonadjacent pairs inside the proposed $S$ and check feasibility, also verifying that appropriate internal vertices exist and can be assigned without conflict.\n\nOption A: $S=\\{u_1,u_2,u_3,v_1,v_2\\}$. Adjacent pairs are all across $U$–$V$ among these, giving $3 \\times 2=6$ edges. Nonadjacent pairs are within $U$ (three pairs among $u_1,u_2,u_3$) and within $V$ (one pair $v_1-v_2$), totaling $4$ nonadjacent pairs. Only $2$ internal vertices (namely $v_3$ and $w$) are available, so at least $4$ internally disjoint paths would be required that each uses a distinct internal vertex, which is impossible. Hence A cannot serve.\n\nOption B: $S=\\{w,u_1,u_2,u_3,v_1\\}$. Pairs involving $w$ are adjacent; across $U$–$V$ give three more edges. The only nonadjacent pairs are within $U$, totaling $3$.
