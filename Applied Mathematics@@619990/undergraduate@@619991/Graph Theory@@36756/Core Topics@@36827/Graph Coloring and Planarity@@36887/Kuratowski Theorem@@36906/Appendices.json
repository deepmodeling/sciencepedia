According to Kuratowski's theorem, a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$. Let's analyze the edge and vertex counts of these two fundamental non-planar graphs and their subdivisions.\n\n1.  The complete graph $K_5$ has 5 vertices and $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$ edges. Any subdivision of $K_5$ is formed by replacing its edges with paths. This process adds vertices but does not change the fact that the resulting graph structure must be built upon at least 10 \"edge-paths\". Therefore, any graph containing a subdivision of $K_5$ must have at least 10 edges.\n\n2.  The complete bipartite graph $K_{3,3}$ has $3+3=6$ vertices and $3 \\times 3 = 9$ edges. Similarly, any subdivision of $K_{3,3}$ must have at least 9 edges.\n\nA non-planar graph must contain a subdivision of at least one of these two graphs. Therefore, a non-planar graph must have at least $\\min(10, 9) = 9$ edges. This establishes that the minimum possible number of edges for any non-planar graph is 9.\n\nThe problem states that our graph $G$ has 6 vertices and is non-planar with the minimum possible number of edges. We have just determined this minimum to be 9 edges. So, we know that $G$ has $|V(G)|=6$ and $|E(G)|=9$.\n\nNow, let's determine which Kuratowski subgraph must be present in $G$.\nSince $G$ is non-planar, it must contain a subdivision of $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$.\n- Can $G$ contain a subdivision of $K_5$? No. A subdivision of $K_5$ requires at least 10 edges, but $G$ only has 9 edges.\n- Therefore, $G$ must contain a subdivision of $K_{3,3}$. Let's call this subdivision $H$.\n\nSo, $H$ is a subgraph of $G$ ($H \\subseteq G$) and $H$ is a subdivision of $K_{3,3}$. We know that any subdivision of $K_{3,3}$ must have at least 9 edges, so $|E(H)| \\ge 9$. Since $H$ is a subgraph of $G$, its number of edges cannot exceed the number of edges in $G$, so $|E(H)| \\le |E(G)| = 9$.\nCombining these two facts, we must have $|E(H)|=9$. Because $H$ is a subgraph of $G$ and they have the same number of edges, they must be the same graph, i.e., $G = H$.\n\nThis means $G$ itself is a subdivision of $K_{3,3}$ with 6 vertices and 9 edges. The original graph $K_{3,3}$ has 6 vertices and 9 edges. A non-trivial subdivision of $K_{3,3}$ would involve replacing an edge with a path of length 2 or more, which would introduce at least one new vertex, resulting in a graph with more than 6 vertices. Since $G$ has exactly 6 vertices, it must be a trivial subdivision of $K_{3,3}$. A trivial subdivision of a graph is the graph itself.\nTherefore, the graph $G$ must be isomorphic to $K_{3,3}$.\n\nNow we can evaluate the given options based on the fact that $G$ is isomorphic to $K_{3,3}$:\n- **A. $G$ contains a subdivision of $K_5$ but not a subdivision of $K_{3,3}$.** This is false. $G$ is $K_{3,3}$, so it does contain a subdivision of $K_{3,3}$ (itself). Furthermore, $G$ cannot contain a subdivision of $K_5$ as it only has 9 edges.\n\n- **B. $G$ contains a subdivision of $K_{3,3}$ but not a subdivision of $K_5$.** This is true. $G$ is $K_{3,3}$, so it is a (trivial) subdivision of $K_{3,3}$. As established, it cannot contain a subdivision of $K_5$. This statement is correct.\n\n- **C. $G$ must contain subdivisions of both $K_5$ and $K_{3,3}$.** This is false.\n\n- **D. $G$ is isomorphic to the complete graph $K_6$.** This is false. $K_6$ has $\\binom{6}{2}=15$ edges, not 9.\n\n- **E.
