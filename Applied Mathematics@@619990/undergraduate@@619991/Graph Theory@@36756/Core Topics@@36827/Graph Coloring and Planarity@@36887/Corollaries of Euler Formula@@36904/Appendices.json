This first practice provides a perfect illustration of this principle by combining the formula with another cornerstone of graph theory: the handshaking lemma.

The layout of this grid can be modeled as a simple graph, where network hubs are represented by vertices and fiber optic cables are represented by edges. For the grid to be planar, the cables must be laid out in such a way that no two cables cross each other. A key design requirement for fault tolerance is that each network hub must be directly connected to exactly four other distinct hubs. The initial design proposal outlines a network with 9 hubs, forming a single connected system. When this network is mapped onto a 2D plane, it partitions the plane into several non-overlapping regions bounded by the cables, in addition to the single unbounded region surrounding the entire network. Determine the total number of these regions (including the unbounded outer region) that would be created by any such planar layout.", "solution": "Let the planar, connected, simple graph have $V$ vertices, $E$ edges, and $F$ faces (regions, including the unbounded one).

The network layout can be modeled as a graph where 10 processing cores are the vertices and the communication links between them are the edges. For the design to be valid, it must satisfy several topological constraints.\n\nFirst, the graph must be **simple**, meaning there is at most one link between any two cores and no link connects a core to itself. Second, the graph must be **connected**, ensuring a communication path exists between any two cores. Third, the graph must be **planar**, as the entire network is fabricated on a flat surface and the links (edges) cannot cross. Finally, to prevent certain types of signal resonance and interference, the design specifications forbid any communication loops involving 3 or 4 cores. In graph-theoretic terms, this means the **girth** of the graph, defined as the length of its shortest cycle, must be at least 5.\n\nGiven these constraints, determine the maximum possible number of communication links the team can include in this network design.", "solution": "Let $G$ be a simple, connected, planar graph with $V$ vertices, $E$ edges, $F$ faces, and girth at least $5$.

Construct two disjoint $5$-cycles $P$ with vertices $p_{1},\\dots,p_{5}$ and edges $p_{i}p_{i+1}$ (indices modulo $5$), and $Q$ with vertices $q_{1},\\dots,q_{5}$ and edges $q_{i}q_{i+1}$.

There are no triangles because the added cross edges form a matching (no two share an endpoint), and no $4$-cycles because the only adjacent pair among the used $P$-vertices is $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$, while their mates $q_{1}$ and $q_{3}$ are not adjacent in $Q$. The original $5$-cycles in $P$ and $Q$ ensure the girth is exactly $5$. A planar embedding exists by placing one $5$-cycle inside the other and routing the three matching edges without crossings by choosing the cyclic order of $q_{1},q_{3},q_{5}$ to match that of $p_{1},p_{2},p_{4}$.
