The minimum number of colors required for an edge coloring of a graph $G$ is called its chromatic index, denoted $\\chi'(G)$. Vizing's theorem states that for any simple graph (a graph without loops or multiple edges), the chromatic index is either equal to its maximum vertex degree, $\\Delta(G)$, or is one greater, i.e., $\\Delta(G) \\le \\chi'(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1$.\n\nThis theorem leads to a classification of simple graphs:\n- **Class 1**: Graphs for which $\\chi'(G) = \\Delta(G)$.\n- **Class 2**: Graphs for which $\\chi'(G) = \\Delta(G) + 1$.\n\nA graph is called regular if all its vertices have the same degree, and non-regular otherwise.\n\nConsider the following four simple graphs, described by their vertex sets $V$ and edge sets $E$.

For $G_{A}$, compute degrees: $\\deg(1)=3$, $\\deg(2)=3$, $\\deg(3)=3$, $\\deg(4)=3$, $\\deg(5)=2$. Thus $G_{A}$ is non-regular with $\\Delta(G_{A})=3$. We show by contradiction that it cannot be 3-edge-colored. Suppose there is a proper $3$-edge-coloring with colors $\\{A,B,C\\}$. At vertex $1$, the three incident edges must receive all three colors, so let's set $c(1,3)=A$, $c(1,4)=B$, and $c(1,5)=C$. At vertex $3$, the incident edges $(1,3),(2,3),(3,4)$ must also receive all three distinct colors, so $\\{c(2,3), c(3,4)\\} = \\{B,C\\}$. At vertex $4$, the incident edges $(1,4),(2,4),(3,4)$ must also receive three distinct colors, so $\\{c(2,4), c(3,4)\\} = \\{A,C\\}$. Comparing the color sets for vertices 3 and 4, we see that the edge $(3,4)$ must be colored $C$. This implies $c(2,3)=B$ and $c(2,4)=A$. Now consider vertex $2$. Its incident edges $(2,3)$ and $(2,4)$ are colored $B$ and $A$ respectively, so its third edge, $(2,5)$, must be colored $C$. However, this creates a conflict at vertex $5$, where the edge $(1,5)$ is already colored $C$. Two edges incident to vertex 5 cannot have the same color. Thus no $3$-edge-coloring exists, so $\\chi'(G_{A})=4=\\Delta(G_{A})+1$. Therefore $G_{A}$ is non-regular, has $\\Delta=3$, and is Class 2.\n\nB. For $G_{B}$, degrees are $\\deg(1)=3$, $\\deg(3)=3$, $\\deg(2)=\\deg(4)=\\deg(5)=2$, so it is non-regular with $\\Delta(G_{B})=3$. We construct a $3$-edge-coloring to show it is Class 1. Color the $5$-cycle edges: $c(1,2)=A, c(2,3)=B, c(3,4)=A, c(4,5)=C, c(5,1)=B$. The edge $(1,3)$ is adjacent to edges with colors $A,B$ at vertex 1 and $B,A$ at vertex 3. In both cases, color $C$ is available. We assign $c(1,3)=C$. This is a proper $3$-edge-coloring, so $\\chi'(G_{B})=3=\\Delta(G_{B})$ and $G_{B}$ is Class 1.\n\nC. For $K_{4}$, the graph is 3-regular. Thus it is not non-regular. It is also Class 1, since $\\chi'(K_{n})=n-1$ for even $n$, so $\\chi'(K_{4})=3=\\Delta(K_{4})$.\n\nD. For $G_{D}$, degrees are $\\deg(1)=\\deg(4)=3$ and $\\deg(2)=\\deg(3)=\\deg(5)=\\deg(6)=2$, so it is non-regular with $\\Delta(G_{D})=3$. We can exhibit a $3$-edge-coloring. Color the edges of the first triangle $(1,2,3)$ with $c(1,2)=A, c(2,3)=B, c(3,1)=C$. Color the edges of the second triangle $(4,5,6)$ with $c(4,5)=A, c(5,6)=B, c(6,4)=C$. The remaining edge is the \"bridge\" $(1,4)$. At vertex 1, colors $A,C$ are used. At vertex 4, colors $A,C$ are used. So we can color the edge $(1,4)$ with color $B$. This is a proper $3$-edge-coloring, so $\\chi'(G_{D})=3=\\Delta(G_{D})$ and $G_{D}$ is Class 1.\n\nConclusion: The only non-regular, Class 2 graph with $\\Delta(G)=3$ among the options is $G_{A}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1488741"}, {"introduction": "Many important concepts in graph theory are embodied by a few key examples.

Removing one color class leaves a $2$-regular spanning subgraph (a $2$-factor) whose components are cycles in which the remaining two colors must alternate; thus every such cycle must have even length. However, any $2$-factor in the Petersen graph must consist of two $5$-cycles (since the graph has girth 5 and 10 vertices). Since 5-cycles have odd length, this is a contradiction.
