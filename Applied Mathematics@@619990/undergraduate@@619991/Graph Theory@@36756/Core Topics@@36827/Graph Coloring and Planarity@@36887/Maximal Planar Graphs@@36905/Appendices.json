The network is modeled as a simple, connected graph $G$, where the servers are the vertices and the physical data cables are the edges. A \"simple\" graph is one with no loops and no more than one edge between any two vertices. The network must be planar, meaning the cables (edges) can be laid out on the floor without any of them crossing.\n\nTo maximize redundancy, the engineers decide to add as many cables as possible without violating the planarity constraint. This process results in a \"maximal planar graph,\" also known as a triangulation, where the plane is partitioned into triangular regions by the cables.

By definition of maximal planar, $G$ is planar and adding any edge between two non-adjacent vertices would destroy planarity. In any plane embedding of $G$, consider a face. If any face boundary had length at least $4$, then two nonadjacent vertices on that facial cycle could be joined by a chord drawn inside the face without creating an edge crossing, yielding a planar supergraph of $G$, which contradicts maximality. Therefore every face boundary has length $3$, so $G$ contains a cycle of length $3$ (a triangle).\n\nA fundamental characterization of bipartite graphs is: a graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no cycle of odd length. One direction follows from the fact that in a bipartition $(U,V)$, any cycle alternates between $U$ and $V$ and hence must have even length; the other direction is the standard two-coloring along components when no odd cycle exists.\n\nSince $G$ contains a $3$-cycle, it contains an odd cycle, and thus $G$ is not bipartite.

A key property of maximal planar graphs is that in any of their planar embeddings, every face is a triangle (i.e., its boundary is a 3-cycle).\n\nSuppose you are given a simple connected planar graph $G$ with $v \\geq 3$ vertices that is not yet maximal planar. Which of the following procedures is **guaranteed** to transform $G$ into a maximal planar graph?\n\nA. Add edges between every pair of non-adjacent vertices in the graph.\n\nB. Calculate the target number of edges for a maximal planar graph, $e = 3v-6$. While the number of edges in the graph is less than $e$, add an edge between a randomly chosen pair of non-adjacent vertices.\n\nC. Fix a planar embedding of $G$. As long as there is a face with more than 3 vertices on its boundary, add an edge (a chord) between two non-adjacent vertices on that face's boundary, ensuring the new edge is drawn entirely within that face.\n\nD. Pick a vertex $v$ with the lowest degree in the graph. Add edges connecting $v$ to all other vertices to which it is not already adjacent. Repeat this for the next lowest-degree vertex, and so on, until the graph is maximal planar.\n\nE. Calculate the number of edges to add, $k = (3v-6) - |E|$.

A graph is maximal planar if and only if it is planar and every face in a planar embedding is bounded by a 3-cycle (triangulated).

Hence “all faces triangles” is equivalent to “maximal planar.”\n\nWe now evaluate each option.\n\nOption A: Adding edges between every pair of non-adjacent vertices produces the complete graph on $v$ vertices, $K_v$. For $v \\geq 5$, $K_v$ is non-planar, so this procedure is not guaranteed to preserve planarity and therefore cannot guarantee a maximal planar graph.\n\nOption B: Targeting $e=3v-6$ edges without respecting the planar embedding can fail. Adding an edge between an arbitrary non-adjacent pair that are not cofacial in the current embedding cannot, in general, be drawn without crossings; thus the graph can become non-planar before reaching $3v-6$. Therefore this is not guaranteed to succeed.\n\nOption C: Fix a planar embedding of $G$. If a face has boundary length at least $4$, select two non-adjacent boundary vertices of that face and add a chord drawn entirely within the face. This preserves planarity and strictly reduces the number of non-triangular faces while increasing $e$ by $1$. Since a planar graph satisfies $e \\leq 3v-6$ for $v \\geq 3$, this process must terminate after finitely many steps. At termination, every face is triangular; by the argument above, the resulting planar graph is maximal planar and has exactly $3v-6$ edges. Hence this procedure is guaranteed to transform $G$ into a maximal planar graph.\n\nOption D: Repeatedly connecting a lowest-degree vertex to all its non-neighbors ignores the planar embedding and can create non-planar subgraphs (for instance, by forming a $K_{5}$ subgraph when connecting a vertex to all vertices of an existing $K_{4}$). Thus it is not guaranteed.\n\nOption E: Selecting non-adjacent pairs by minimizing degree sums is a heuristic unrelated to the embedding. As in Options B and D, adding such edges can violate planarity; hitting the count $3v-6$ is not sufficient unless planarity is preserved at each step. Therefore this is not guaranteed.\n\nTherefore, only Option C is guaranteed to transform an arbitrary simple connected planar graph into a maximal planar graph.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1521449"}]}
