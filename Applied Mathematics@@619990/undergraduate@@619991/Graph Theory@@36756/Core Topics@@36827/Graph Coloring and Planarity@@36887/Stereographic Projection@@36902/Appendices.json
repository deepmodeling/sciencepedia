A stereographic projection maps a point $P = (X,Y,Z)$ on the sphere, other than the North Pole $N=(0,0,1)$, to a point in the equatorial plane $Z=0$. This projection is established by finding the unique intersection of the line passing through $N$ and $P$ with the plane $Z=0$.

The vertex $v$ becomes an isolated vertex in the planar drawing, completely disconnected from the projections of its former neighbors.", "solution": "Let's analyze the process of stereographic projection and its effect on the graph $G$, particularly on the vertex $v$ located at the center of projection $P$.\n\nStep 1: Understand Stereographic Projection.\nThe stereographic projection maps points from a sphere $\\mathbb{S}^2$ to a plane $\\Pi$. The center of projection, which we can consider the \"North Pole\" $P$, is the only point on the sphere that does not have a corresponding finite point on the plane $\\Pi$. As a point $Q$ on the sphere approaches $P$, the line through $P$ and $Q$ becomes more and more parallel to the projection plane $\\Pi$. The intersection point $Q'$ on the plane moves farther and farther away from the origin (the projection of the South Pole). In the limit as $Q$ approaches $P$, the projection $Q'$ \"goes to infinity\". Thus, the point $P$ is mapped to the \"point at infinity\" on the plane.\n\nStep 2: Relate the \"point at infinity\" to planar graph drawings.\nIn the context of planar graph theory, a drawing on an infinite plane has one special face that is unbounded; this is known as the outer face. This unbounded region conceptually contains the \"point at infinity\". Therefore, any feature of the spherical embedding that is mapped to infinity by the projection becomes part of the outer face of the planar drawing.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the projection of vertex $v$.\nThe problem states that vertex $v$ is located at the center of projection $P$. Based on Step 1, the vertex $v$ itself is projected to the point at infinity. This means that $v$ will not appear as a vertex (a finite point) in the resulting planar drawing. Its location on the sphere is now associated with the entire unbounded outer region of the drawing on the plane.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the projection of edges incident to $v$.\nConsider an edge $(v, u)$ in the graph $G$. On the sphere, this is an arc connecting the vertex $v$ (at point $P$) to another vertex $u$ (at a point $U \\neq P$). The vertex $u$ is projected to a finite point $u'$ on the plane $\\Pi$. The edge is an arc of points. Points on the arc near $u$ are projected to points near $u'$. Points on the arc near $v$ (i.e., near $P$) are projected to points very far away on the plane. The entire edge $(v, u)$ is therefore projected to an unbounded curve (a ray or a half-line) starting at $u'$ and extending out to infinity.\n\nStep 5: Conclude the overall structure and evaluate the options.\nThe vertices of the graph $G$ other than $v$ are projected to finite points on the plane $\\Pi$. The edges of $G$ not incident to $v$ are projected to finite curves connecting these points. The edges that were incident to $v$ become unbounded curves extending from the projections of $v$'s neighbors out into the unbounded face. The collection of these neighbors now forms the boundary of this outer face. The vertex $v$ itself has effectively \"become\" the outer face.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this understanding:\n\n*   A. The vertex $v$ is projected to the origin of the plane $\\Pi$, and its neighbors are arranged in a circle around it. This is incorrect. The point antipodal to the center of projection (the \"South Pole\") is projected to the origin. The vertex $v$ is at the center of projection.\n*   B. The vertex $v$ is not represented as a finite point in the drawing; its location on the sphere corresponds to the unbounded outer face of the planar drawing. This is the correct description. The vertex at the center of projection is mapped to infinity, which corresponds to the outer face of the planar embedding.\n*   C. All edges originally incident to $v$ become parallel, infinite lines in the planar drawing. This is incorrect. The edges become unbounded curves (rays), but there is no requirement for them to be parallel. Their direction depends on the location of the neighbors on the sphere.\n*   D. The projection is ill-defined, and the resulting drawing is no longer a planar graph because all edges originally incident to $v$ must now cross. This is incorrect. Stereographic projection is a homeomorphism (a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse) between the sphere (minus the projection point) and the plane. It preserves topological properties like planarity. The projection is well-defined for all points except $v$, and the resulting drawing is planar.\n*   E. The vertex $v$ becomes an isolated vertex in the planar drawing, completely disconnected from the projections of its former neighbors. This is incorrect. The vertex $v$ is not represented as a vertex at all. Its neighbors are not disconnected; they are now on the boundary of the outer face.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1535499"}]}
