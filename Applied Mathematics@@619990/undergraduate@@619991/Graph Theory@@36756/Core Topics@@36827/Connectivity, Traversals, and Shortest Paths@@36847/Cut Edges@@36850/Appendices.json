Initially, the graph has one connected component. Removing $uv$ leaves two isolated vertices $u$ and $v$, so the number of connected components increases from $1$ to $2$. Therefore, $uv$ is a bridge and the number of bridges in $K_2$ is $1$.\n\n2) Case $n \\ge 3$: Let $uv$ be any edge of $K_n$. Since $n \\ge 3$, there exists a vertex $w$ with $w \\neq u$ and $w \\neq v$. By completeness, the edges $uw$ and $wv$ are present. Hence $u,w,v$ form a 3-cycle, and $uv$ lies on this cycle. An edge on a cycle is not a bridge, because after removing $uv$ there remains the path $u \\to w \\to v$ connecting its endpoints, and the graph remains connected.

The edge $(v_3,v_4)$ does not belong to any cycle, since there is no alternative path between $v_3$ and $v_4$ avoiding it; removing it disconnects the graph into two components. Therefore this graph is connected and has exactly one bridge, namely $(v_3,v_4)$.\n\nFor option B, the edges form a 6-cycle $(v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4,v_5,v_6,v_1)$ plus the chord $(v_1,v_4)$. Every edge lies on some cycle (the 6-cycle or a shorter cycle using the chord), so there are no bridges.\n\nFor option C, the subgraph on $\\{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4\\}$ is a 4-cycle with a chord $(v_2,v_4)$, and $\\{(v_1,v_5),(v_5,v_6)\\}$ is a path attached at $v_1$.

A link is defined as a **bridge** if its failure (i.e., removal of the corresponding edge) increases the number of connected components in the network.\n\nThe architect is interested in a specific, non-obvious vulnerability: a network configuration that contains a bridge $e = (u, v)$ where both routers $u$ and $v$ are non-trivial hubs, meaning each is connected to at least one other router besides their connection to each other. In graph theory terms, the architect is looking for a graph containing a bridge $e = (u, v)$ such that the degree of vertex $u$ is $\\deg(u) > 1$ and the degree of vertex $v$ is $\\deg(v) > 1$.\n\nWhich of the following network configurations, if any, exhibits this specific property?\n\nA.

An edge $e=(u,v)$ is a bridge if and only if removing it increases the number of connected components. Equivalently, an edge is a bridge if and only if it does not lie on any cycle. The target property requires a bridge $e=(u,v)$ with $\\deg(u)>1$ and $\\deg(v)>1$.\n\nCase A: A cycle on five vertices (the 5-cycle). In a cycle, every edge lies on a cycle. Therefore, for any edge $e$, there exists an alternate path between its endpoints that avoids $e$, so removing $e$ leaves the graph connected. Hence no edge is a bridge, so the required property does not occur.\n\nCase B: A star with center $c$ and leaves $p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4$. For any edge $e=(c,p_i)$, removing $e$ disconnects $p_i$ from the rest, so $e$ is a bridge. However, $\\deg(c)=4>1$ while $\\deg(p_i)=1$. The condition requires both endpoints to have degree greater than $1$, which fails here.

The edge $e$ is the only connection between the two 3-cliques, so it does not lie on any cycle spanning both clusters. Removing $e$ separates the graph into two connected components, so $e$ is a bridge. Moreover, $\\deg(v_1)=3$ (neighbors $v_2,v_3,v_4$) and $\\deg(v_4)=3$ (neighbors $v_5,v_6,v_1$), hence both degrees exceed $1$. Therefore this configuration satisfies the required property.\n\nCase D: The complete graph on five vertices $K_5$. In $K_5$, the edge connectivity is $4$, and in particular, removing any single edge leaves the graph connected. Equivalently, every edge lies on many cycles. Thus there are no bridges, and the required property does not occur.\n\nOnly configuration C exhibits a bridge whose endpoints both have degree greater than $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1493374"}]}
