From $3$ we reach $5$ via $\\{3,5\\}$; from $5$ and $7$ there are no new vertices. Thus the connected component containing $1$ is $C_{1}=\\{1,3,5,7\\}$.

Four of the servers form this cycle, and the fifth server is connected by a single link to exactly one of the servers in the 4-cycle.\n\nThe resilience of a network to server failures is measured by its vertex connectivity, denoted $\\kappa$.

We also use the general bound $\\kappa(G) \\leq \\delta(G)$, where $\\delta(G)$ is the minimum degree of $G$.\n\nNetwork A (the cycle $C_{5}$): Each vertex in $C_{5}$ has degree $2$, so $\\delta(C_{5})=2$ and therefore $\\kappa(C_{5}) \\leq 2$. Removing any single vertex from $C_{5}$ leaves a path on $4$ vertices, which is connected, so no $1$-vertex removal disconnects the graph; hence $\\kappa(C_{5}) \\geq 2$. To see that two vertices suffice, remove two nonadjacent vertices (for example, remove $v_{1}$ and $v_{3}$ when the cycle is $v_{1}-v_{2}-v_{3}-v_{4}-v_{5}-v_{1}$). The remaining graph has an isolated vertex $v_{2}$ and an edge $v_{4}v_{5}$, so it is disconnected. Therefore $\\kappa(C_{5})=2$.\n\nNetwork B (a $C_{4}$ with a leaf attached to one cycle vertex): Let the cycle be $a-b-c-d-a$ and let $x$ be the leaf attached only to $a$. Then $\\delta(G)=1$ (the leaf), so $\\kappa(G) \\leq 1$. The graph is connected and nontrivial, so removing zero vertices does not disconnect it, implying $\\kappa(G) \\geq 1$. Moreover, removing the single vertex $a$ separates $x$ from the path $b-c-d$, yielding a disconnected graph, so $\\kappa(G)=1$.\n\nThus the two vertex connectivities are $1$ (Network B) and $2$ (Network A).

The *degree* of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it, and the *minimum degree* of a graph $G$, denoted $\\delta(G)$, is the smallest degree among all its vertices.

By definition, $\\kappa(G)=1$ holds if and only if $G$ has a cut-vertex, i.e., a single vertex whose removal disconnects the graph.\n\nConsider each option:\n\nOption A: $K_{4}$. In $K_{n}$, every vertex has degree $n-1$, so $\\delta(K_{4})=3$. The vertex connectivity of a complete graph is $\\kappa(K_{n})=n-1$, hence $\\kappa(K_{4})=3$. Therefore $K_{4}$ does not satisfy $\\kappa(G)=1$.\n\nOption B: Two copies of $K_{4}$ identified at one vertex. Let the shared vertex be $v$. In each original $K_{4}$, a non-identified vertex has degree $3$; identification does not add neighbors to such a vertex outside its original $K_{4}$, so every non-shared vertex still has degree $3$. The shared vertex $v$ is adjacent to the $3$ remaining vertices from each copy, so $\\deg(v)=6$. Hence $\\delta(G)=3$. Removing $v$ separates the graph into two disjoint copies of $K_{3}$, so $v$ is a cut-vertex. Therefore $\\kappa(G)=1$. This option satisfies both required properties.\n\nOption C: The cubical graph (the $3$-cube). Each vertex has degree $3$, so $\\delta(G)=3$. However, the $3$-cube has no cut-vertex; equivalently, it is $3$-vertex-connected, so $\\kappa(G)=3$. Therefore it does not satisfy $\\kappa(G)=1$.\n\nOption D: $W_{7}$. In a wheel $W_{n}$ with $n \\ge 4$, the hub has degree $n-1$, and each rim vertex has degree $3$, so $\\delta(W_{7})=3$. Removing the hub leaves the cycle $C_{6}$, which is connected, and removing any rim vertex leaves the hub still adjacent to all remaining rim vertices, so there is no cut-vertex. Thus $\\kappa(W_{7}) \\ge 2$, and in fact $\\kappa(W_{7})=3$.
