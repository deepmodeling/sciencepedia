The distance between two servers, $d_G(u, v)$, is the number of links in the shortest path between them.\n\nCertain servers are critical for maintaining network connectivity. A server is called a **cut vertex** (or articulation point) if its removal (along with all its incident links) increases the number of connected components in the network. The network can be decomposed into a set of **blocks** (or biconnected components), where each block is a maximal subgraph that has no cut vertices of its own. Any two blocks in a graph can share at most one vertex, and if they do, that vertex must be a cut vertex of the original graph.\n\nThis decomposition gives rise to a higher-level structural representation called the **block-cutpoint tree**, denoted $T_G$.
