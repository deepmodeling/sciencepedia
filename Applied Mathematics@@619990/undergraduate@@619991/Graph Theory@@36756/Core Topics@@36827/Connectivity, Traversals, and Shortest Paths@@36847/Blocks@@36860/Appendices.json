A block is a maximal connected subgraph with no cut vertices.\n\nFirst, determine the cut vertices. Let the unique common vertex be $s$. Consider removing $s$ from $G$. Since $C_{A}$ and $C_{B}$ intersect only at $s$, removing $s$ disconnects the graph into two disjoint subgraphs, each being the corresponding $5$-cycle with $s$ removed. Each such subgraph is connected (a path), but they are disjoint from one another. Therefore, the number of connected components increases, so $s$ is a cut vertex.\n\nNext, consider any vertex $u \\in V$ with $u \\neq s$. Without loss of generality, suppose $u \\in C_{A}\\setminus\\{s\\}$. Removing $u$ from $G$ turns $C_{A}$ into a path on its remaining vertices, which is connected, and $C_{B}$ remains intact and connected. Moreover, both parts remain attached via the shared vertex $s$ (which is still present), so the overall graph remains connected. Hence, removing $u$ does not increase the number of connected components. Therefore, no vertex other than $s$ is a cut vertex. It follows that $G$ has exactly one cut vertex.\n\nNow determine the blocks. A cycle on at least three vertices has no cut vertices and is $2$-connected, hence each $5$-cycle is a connected subgraph with no cut vertices. Consider $C_{A}$ as a subgraph: it has no cut vertices within itself, and adding any additional vertex or edge from $C_{B}$ would create a larger connected subgraph in which the shared vertex $s$ becomes a cut vertex (removing $s$ would disconnect the added part from the rest), violating the definition of a block. Thus $C_{A}$ is maximal with respect to having no cut vertices and is a block. The same argument applies to $C_{B}$. The entire graph $G$ is not a block because it has the cut vertex $s$. Therefore, the blocks are exactly the two $5$-cycles, so $G$ has exactly two blocks.\n\nCombining these conclusions, $G$ has $2$ blocks and $1$ cut vertex.

Every edge of $G$ belongs to exactly one block, and two blocks share at most one vertex, which must be a cut vertex of $G$.\n\nTo visualize the relationship between these components, one can construct the **block-cut tree** of $G$, denoted $T(G)$. This is a new graph defined as follows:\n- The vertex set of $T(G)$ consists of two types of vertices: one \"b-vertex\" for each block of $G$, and one \"c-vertex\" for each cut vertex of $G$.\n- An edge exists in $T(G)$ between a c-vertex (representing cut vertex $a$) and a b-vertex (representing block $B$) if and only if the vertex $a$ is a member of the block $B$ in the original graph $G$.

By construction, the vertex set of $T(G)$ consists of $b$ b-vertices (one for each block) and $c$ c-vertices (one for each cut vertex), so\n$$\n|V(T(G))|=b+c.\n$$\nWe first show $T(G)$ is connected. Take any two vertices of $T(G)$, each corresponding to either a block or a cut vertex of $G$. Choose any vertex $u$ in the subgraph of $G$ corresponding to the first and any vertex $v$ in the subgraph of $G$ corresponding to the second. Since $G$ is connected, there is a $u$-$v$ path in $G$. As one traverses this path, one remains within a block until passing through a cut vertex to enter a different block. Thus this path induces an alternating sequence of blocks and cut vertices, which yields a path in $T(G)$ between the two chosen vertices. Hence $T(G)$ is connected.\n\nWe next show $T(G)$ has no cycles. Suppose, for contradiction, that $T(G)$ contains a cycle\n$$\nB_{1}-a_{1}-B_{2}-a_{2}-\\dots-B_{k}-a_{k}-B_{1},\n$$\nwhere each $B_{i}$ is a b-vertex (block) and each $a_{i}$ is a c-vertex (cut vertex), with adjacency indicating membership of $a_{i}$ in $B_{i}$ and $B_{i+1}$ (indices modulo $k$). Let $H$ be the union in $G$ of the blocks $B_{1},\\dots,B_{k}$. Then $H$ is connected. For any $i$, there is a path in $B_{i+1}$ from $a_{i}$ to $a_{i+1}$, and there is also a path in $H \\setminus B_{i+1}$ from $a_{i}$ to $a_{i+1}$ that goes around the rest of the cycle. Thus between consecutive cut vertices on the cycle there are two internally disjoint routes within $H$. This redundancy around the entire cycle implies that removing any single vertex from $H$ does not disconnect $H$, so $H$ has no cut vertices. Since $H$ properly contains at least two blocks, this contradicts the maximality of blocks. Therefore $T(G)$ is acyclic.\n\nHaving shown that $T(G)$ is connected and acyclic, $T(G)$ is a tree. A fundamental property of trees is that if $H$ is a tree, then $|E(H)|=|V(H)|-1$. Applying this to $T(G)$ gives\n$$\n|E(T(G))|=|V(T(G))|-1=(b+c)-1=b+c-1.\n$$\nTherefore, the number of edges in the block-cut tree is $b+c-1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{b+c-1}$$", "id": "1484267"}]}
