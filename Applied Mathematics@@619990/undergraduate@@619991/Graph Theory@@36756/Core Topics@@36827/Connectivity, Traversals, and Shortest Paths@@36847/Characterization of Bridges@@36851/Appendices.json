This first exercise provides a clear, hands-on opportunity to apply this core principle.

The design consists of a main backbone and several local clusters.\n\nThe backbone is a high-speed fiber optic ring connecting $n=8$ primary data centers, labeled $c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_8$. Each data center $c_i$ is connected directly to its neighbors $c_{i-1}$ and $c_{i+1}$ (with indices taken cyclically, so $c_1$ is connected to $c_8$ and $c_2$).\n\nFrom each of these 8 primary data centers, a separate local cluster extends outwards. Each local cluster consists of a linear chain of 4 secondary offices. For the cluster attached to center $c_i$, the offices are labeled $o_{i,1}, o_{i,2}, o_{i,3}, o_{i,4}$. The connection topology is as follows: the primary data center $c_i$ is connected only to the first office $o_{i,1}$; $o_{i,1}$ is connected only to $c_i$ and $o_{i,2}$; $o_{i,2}$ is connected only to $o_{i,1}$ and $o_{i,3}$; and so on, up to $o_{i,4}$ which is connected only to $o_{i,3}$.\n\nThis entire network can be modeled as a single connected graph where data centers and offices are vertices, and communication links are edges. A link is defined as \"critical\" if its failure would disconnect the network into two or more separate components. In graph theory, such an edge is known as a bridge.\n\nHow many critical links are there in the entire network?", "solution": "Model the network as a graph. The backbone forms a cycle on the vertices $c_{1}, \\dots, c_{8}$, specifically an $8$-cycle. A fundamental fact in graph theory is that no edge that lies on a cycle is a bridge, because removing such an edge leaves an alternative route along the remainder of the cycle connecting its endpoints; thus removal does not increase the number of connected components.\n\nFrom each $c_{i}$ a path of length $4$ edges extends: $c_{i}$–$o_{i,1}$–$o_{i,2}$–$o_{i,3}$–$o_{i,4}$. These edges do not lie on any cycle, since the only cycle in the graph is the backbone ring. Another standard fact is that any edge not contained in any cycle is a bridge; equivalently, every edge of a tree is a bridge. Therefore, for each $i$, the four edges $(c_i, o_{i,1})$, $(o_{i,1}, o_{i,2})$, $(o_{i,2}, o_{i,3})$, and $(o_{i,3}, o_{i,4})$ are bridges.\n\nThe backbone edges are not bridges, and all bridges are exactly the edges in these $8$ attached paths.

The network's structure is modeled as a simple undirected graph $G$. The graph consists of a central \"core\" component and $m$ peripheral \"satellite\" components.\n\nThe core component is modeled as a complete graph, denoted $K_p$, with $p$ vertices. Each of the $m$ satellite components is also modeled as a complete graph, denoted $K_q$, with $q$ vertices. The network has the following parameters: $m \\ge 1$, $p \\ge \\max(2, m)$, and $q \\ge 3$.\n\nThe components are interconnected as follows:\n1.  In the core component $K_p$, a set of $m$ distinct vertices $\\{c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_m\\}$ are designated as ports.\n2.

Indeed, $e_{i}$ is the unique edge between the satellite $S_{i}$ and the rest of the graph. If $e_{i}$ is removed, all vertices of $S_{i}$ become disconnected from the core and from all other satellites, so the number of connected components increases by $1$. Equivalently, there is no alternate path between $c_{i}$ and $s_{i}$ avoiding $e_{i}$, so $e_{i}$ lies on no cycle and is a bridge. Therefore there are at least $m$ bridges, contributed by the $m$ attachment edges.\n\n2) No internal edge inside any satellite $K_{q}$ is a bridge when $q \\ge 3$. In $K_{q}$ every edge lies on a triangle, hence on a cycle, so removing any single internal satellite edge does not disconnect $K_{q}$; adding extra edges (the attachments) cannot create a bridge from a non-bridge, since cycles persist under edge additions. Thus all internal satellite edges are non-bridges.\n\n3) Consider internal edges of the core $K_{p}$.\n- If $p \\ge 3$, then in $K_{p}$ every edge lies on a triangle, hence on a cycle; such edges are not bridges in $K_{p}$, and adding attachment edges cannot destroy these cycles. Therefore no internal core edge is a bridge when $p \\ge 3$.\n- If $p=2$, the core is $K_{2}$ with vertices $u$ and $v$ and a single core edge $uv$. This edge lies on no cycle in $G$ because the only connections between satellites and the core are the attachment edges to their designated core ports, and there is no path from $u$ to $v$ avoiding $uv$ once $uv$ is removed: removing $uv$ separates the graph into the component containing $u$ together with the satellites attached to $u$, and the component containing $v$ together with the satellites attached to $v$. Hence $uv$ is a bridge when $p=2$.\n\nCombining 1)–3):\n- For $p \\ge 3$, the bridges are exactly the $m$ attachment edges, so the total number of bridges is $m$.\n- For $p=2$, the bridges are the $m$ attachment edges plus the single core edge, for a total of $m+1$.\n\nThis matches statement B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1487108"}, {"introduction": "After working with concrete examples, it's easy to develop the intuition that bridges are always connected to simple, low-degree vertices.

Claim: “$G$ has no bridges if and only if $\\delta(G) \\geq 2$.” The forward direction is true: if $G$ has no bridges, then no vertex can have degree $1$, because if there were a vertex $u$ with $\\deg(u)=1$, its unique incident edge would be a bridge, a contradiction. Hence $\\delta(G) \\geq 2$. The reverse direction is false. Counterexample: take two cycles and connect them by a single edge. Formally, let $G$ be obtained from two disjoint cycles $C_{m}$ and $C_{n}$ by adding a single edge $xy$ where $x \\in V(C_{m})$ and $y \\in V(C_{n})$.

Pick one vertex from each copy and add a single edge between them. The resulting graph is connected; the added edge is the only interconnection between the two copies, hence it is a bridge. The degrees of the chosen endpoints increase to $k+1$, while all other vertices still have degree $k$, so the minimum degree remains $\\delta(G)=k$. Thus C is true.\n\nD. Claim: “If an edge is a bridge, then at least one endpoint has degree $1$.” This is false. In the earlier construction with two cycles (or two triangles) connected by a single edge, the bridge’s endpoints have degree at least $2$ (indeed $3$ in the two-triangles example), not $1$.
