This first exercise challenges you to apply the definitions of a bridge and edge connectivity to identify a specific graph from a list of candidates.

The **edge connectivity** of a connected graph $G$, denoted $\\lambda(G)$, is the minimum number of edges whose removal disconnects the graph. An edge whose removal disconnects a connected graph is called a **bridge** or a **cut-edge**.\n\nConsider a set of six vertices $V = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5, v_6\\}$.

The edge connectivity of a connected graph $G$, denoted $\\lambda(G)$, is the minimum number of edges whose removal disconnects $G$. An edge is a bridge if its removal disconnects the graph; equivalently, an edge is a bridge if and only if it does not belong to any cycle.\n\nWe examine each option for the four required properties: connectedness, exactly $6$ edges, $\\lambda(G)=1$, and exactly one bridge.\n\nOption A: $E_{A}=\\{(v_{1},v_{2}),(v_{2},v_{3}),(v_{3},v_{4}),(v_{4},v_{5}),(v_{5},v_{1}),(v_{1},v_{6})\\}$. The subgraph on $\\{v_{1},v_{2},v_{3},v_{4},v_{5}\\}$ is a $5$-cycle, hence connected, and $(v_{1},v_{6})$ attaches $v_{6}$ to $v_{1}$, so the whole graph is connected. The edge set has cardinality $6$, so the second condition holds. In a cycle, every edge belongs to that cycle, hence none of the five cycle edges is a bridge. The edge $(v_{1},v_{6})$ is not in any cycle (since $v_{6}$ has degree $1$), so it is a bridge. Therefore, the graph has exactly one bridge. Since a bridge exists, removing it disconnects the graph, so $\\lambda(G)=1$. Thus A satisfies all four properties.\n\nOption B: $E_{B}=\\{(v_{1},v_{2}),(v_{2},v_{3}),(v_{3},v_{1}),(v_{3},v_{4}),(v_{4},v_{5}),(v_{5},v_{6})\\}$. This is a triangle on $\\{v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}\\}$ with a path $v_{3}-v_{4}-v_{5}-v_{6}$ appended at $v_{3}$. It is connected and has $6$ edges. The edges $(v_{3},v_{4})$, $(v_{4},v_{5})$, and $(v_{5},v_{6})$ do not lie on any cycle, hence each is a bridge. Therefore, there are at least three bridges, so the graph does not have exactly one bridge. Although $\\lambda(G)=1$ holds due to the presence of bridges, the “exactly one bridge” condition fails.\n\nOption C: $E_{C}=\\{(v_{1},v_{2}),(v_{2},v_{3}),(v_{3},v_{4}),(v_{4},v_{5}),(v_{5},v_{6}),(v_{6},v_{1})\\}$. This is a $6$-cycle, which is connected and has $6$ edges. Every edge lies on a cycle, hence there are no bridges. Removing any single edge leaves a path on $6$ vertices, which is connected; thus at least two edges must be removed to disconnect, so $\\lambda(G)\\geq 2$. In particular, $\\lambda(G)\\neq 1$. Hence C fails the edge-connectivity and bridge conditions.\n\nOption D: $E_{D}=\\{(v_{1},v_{2}),(v_{2},v_{3}),(v_{3},v_{1}),(v_{4},v_{5}),(v_{5},v_{6}),(v_{6},v_{4})\\}$. This is the disjoint union of two triangles, so it is disconnected and fails the connectivity requirement.\n\nTherefore, the only graph satisfying all four conditions is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1499316"}, {"introduction": "Real-world networks are often built by augmenting existing structures. This practice problem simulates such a scenario, where a simple cycle graph is reinforced with an additional connection.

To improve the network's resilience, a single long-range connection is added. This new connection is represented by an edge that connects a pair of vertices that are diametrically opposite on the cycle, for instance, $v_0$ and $v_4$.\n\nDetermine the edge connectivity of the resulting graph.

Therefore, $G$ remains connected after removal of any single cycle edge.\n\nThus no single edge is a bridge, so\n$$\n\\lambda(G) \\geq 2.\n$$\n\nCombining the two inequalities gives\n$$\n\\lambda(G)=2.\n$$\n\nFor completeness, note that a $2$-edge cut exists (consistent with the bound $\\lambda(G) \\leq 2$): removing the two edges incident to any degree-$2$ vertex, for example $v_{1}v_{0}$ and $v_{1}v_{2}$, isolates $v_{1}$ and disconnects $G$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "1499388"}, {"introduction": "Moving from analysis to design is a key step in mastering graph theory. This problem asks you to determine the smallest possible network that meets specific design criteria: a fixed number of connections per node (4-regularity) and a precise level of resilience ($\\lambda(G) = 2$). Solving this requires both theoretical deduction to establish a lower bound and creative construction to prove that bound is achievable [@problem_id:1499380].", "problem": "In network theory, the robustness of a network can be modeled by the connectivity of its underlying graph. Consider a specialized, decentralized communication network designed with the following constraints. The network is represented as a simple graph $G=(V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of nodes and $E$ is the set of communication links.\n\n1.  **Regularity:** Every node must have exactly four communication links. In graph-theoretic terms, the graph $G$ must be 4-regular.\n2.  **Resilience:** The network must be resilient to any single link failure, meaning the removal of any single edge does not disconnect the graph. However, to minimize costs, it is designed to be just barely above this threshold. This is captured by the requirement that the edge connectivity of the graph is exactly two, i.e., $\\lambda(G) = 2$.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of vertices $|V|$ required to construct a graph that satisfies both of these properties?", "solution": "Let $G=(V,E)$ be a simple $4$-regular graph with edge connectivity $\\lambda(G)=2$. By definition, there exists a partition $(S,T)$ of $V$ such that exactly two edges cross between $S$ and $T$, and removing those two edges disconnects $G$. Denote $s=|S|$ and $t=|T|$, so $s+t=|V|$.\n\nFor each $v\\in S$, let $d_{T}(v)$ be the number of neighbors of $v$ in $T$. Since exactly two edges cross the cut, we have\n$$\n\\sum_{v\\in S} d_{T}(v)=2.\n$$\nBecause $G$ is $4$-regular, the internal degree of $v$ within $S$ is $d_{S}(v)=4-d_{T}(v)$. Let\n$$\nZ=\\{v\\in S:\\ d_{T}(v)=0\\}.\n$$\nIf $Z$ is nonempty, any $v\\in Z$ must have $d_{S}(v)=4$.

We now exclude $s=1$ and $s=2$:\n- If $s=1$, then the unique vertex $v$ in $S$ has $d_{T}(v)=2$, hence $d_{S}(v)=2$, which is impossible since with $s=1$ there are no internal neighbors.\n- If $s=2$, the only way to have $\\sum d_{T}(v)=2$ with $d_{T}(v)\\geq 1$ is $(d_{T}(v_{1}),d_{T}(v_{2}))=(1,1)$, which forces $d_{S}(v_{i})=3$ for $i=1,2$, impossible in a simple graph on $2$ vertices where the maximum internal degree is $1$.\n\nTherefore $Z$ cannot be empty, and we conclude $s\\geq 5$. By symmetry, the same argument applied to $T$ yields $t\\geq 5$. Hence\n$$\n|V|=s+t\\geq 10.\n$$\n\nIt remains to show that $|V|=10$ is achievable. Construct $G$ as follows. Take two disjoint copies of $K_{5}$ with vertex sets $S$ and $T$. In $S$, delete a single edge $x_{1}y_{1}$; in $T$, delete a single edge $x_{2}y_{2}$. Then add the two cross edges $x_{1}x_{2}$ and $y_{1}y_{2}$. Every vertex still has degree $4$ (the endpoints of the deleted edges lose one internal edge and gain one cross edge; all other vertices are unchanged), so the resulting graph is $4$-regular and simple. The two added cross edges form a $2$-edge cut: removing them disconnects the graph into the two copies of $K_{5}$ minus an edge (each connected), while removing any single edge does not disconnect the graph (removing a cross edge leaves the other cross edge connecting $S$ and $T$, and removing an internal edge leaves both sides connected and still joined by two cross edges). Therefore $\\lambda(G)=2$ for this $10$-vertex graph.\n\nCombining the lower bound $|V|\\geq 10$ with this explicit construction, the minimum number of vertices is $10$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10}$$", "id": "1499380"}]}
