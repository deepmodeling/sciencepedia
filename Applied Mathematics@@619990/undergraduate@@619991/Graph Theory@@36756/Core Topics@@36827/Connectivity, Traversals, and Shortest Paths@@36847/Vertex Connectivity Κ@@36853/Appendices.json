The network linking these servers is designed with a specific topology to provide redundancy. The connections are as follows:\n1.  For each $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, server $a_i$ is connected to server $a_{i+1}$.\n2.  For each $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, server $b_i$ is connected to server $b_{i+1}$.\n3.

The *degree* of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it, and the *minimum degree* of a graph $G$, denoted $\\delta(G)$, is the smallest degree among all its vertices. The *vertex connectivity* of a graph $G$, denoted $\\kappa(G)$, is the minimum number of vertices whose removal would either disconnect the graph or reduce it to a single vertex.

By definition, $\\kappa(G)=1$ holds if and only if $G$ has a cut-vertex, i.e., a single vertex whose removal disconnects the graph.\n\nConsider each option:\n\nOption A: $K_{4}$. In $K_{n}$, every vertex has degree $n-1$, so $\\delta(K_{4})=3$. The vertex connectivity of a complete graph is $\\kappa(K_{n})=n-1$, hence $\\kappa(K_{4})=3$. Therefore $K_{4}$ does not satisfy $\\kappa(G)=1$.\n\nOption B: Two copies of $K_{4}$ identified at one vertex. Let the shared vertex be $v$. In each original $K_{4}$, a non-identified vertex has degree $3$; identification does not add neighbors to such a vertex outside its original $K_{4}$, so every non-shared vertex still has degree $3$. The shared vertex $v$ is adjacent to the $3$ remaining vertices from each copy, so $\\deg(v)=6$. Hence $\\delta(G)=3$. Removing $v$ separates the graph into two disjoint copies of $K_{3}$, so $v$ is a cut-vertex. Therefore $\\kappa(G)=1$. This option satisfies both required properties.\n\nOption C: The cubical graph (the $3$-cube). Each vertex has degree $3$, so $\\delta(G)=3$. However, the $3$-cube has no cut-vertex; equivalently, it is $3$-vertex-connected, so $\\kappa(G)=3$. Therefore it does not satisfy $\\kappa(G)=1$.\n\nOption D: $W_{7}$. In a wheel $W_{n}$ with $n \\ge 4$, the hub has degree $n-1$, and each rim vertex has degree $3$, so $\\delta(W_{7})=3$. Removing the hub leaves the cycle $C_{6}$, which is connected, and removing any rim vertex leaves the hub still adjacent to all remaining rim vertices, so there is no cut-vertex. Thus $\\kappa(W_{7}) \\ge 2$, and in fact $\\kappa(W_{7})=3$.
