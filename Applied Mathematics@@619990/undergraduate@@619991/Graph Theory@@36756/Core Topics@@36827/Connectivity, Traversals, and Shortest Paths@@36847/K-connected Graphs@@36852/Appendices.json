Therefore,\n$$\n\\kappa(G)\\leq 3.\n$$\n\nTo show equality, it suffices to prove that removing any set $S$ of at most two vertices leaves the graph connected. This yields $\\kappa(G)\\geq 3$, and combined with the upper bound gives $\\kappa(G)=3$.\n\nWe proceed by cases on $|S|$.\n\nCase 1: $|S|=1$. Let $S=\\{X\\}$.\n- If $X=A_{i}$ for some $i$, then the remaining vertices are $A_{j},A_{k},B_{1},B_{2},B_{3}$ where $\\{i,j,k\\}=\\{1,2,3\\}$. The edges present include $A_{j}A_{k}$ (the $A$-triangle edge), the entire $B$-triangle on $\\{B_{1},B_{2},B_{3}\\}$, and the two matching edges $A_{j}B_{j}$ and $A_{k}B_{k}$. The subgraph induced by $\\{A_{j},B_{j},B_{k},A_{k}\\}$ contains the 4-cycle $A_{j}-B_{j}-B_{k}-A_{k}-A_{j}$, which is connected. The vertex $B_i$ is connected to this component via the $B$-triangle. Hence the entire remaining graph is connected.\n- If $X=B_{i}$, the argument is symmetric: the $A$-triangle remains intact, the $B$-triangle becomes an edge between the two remaining $B$-vertices, and two matching edges survive, forming a connected subgraph that includes every remaining vertex.\n\nThus, deleting any single vertex leaves a connected graph.\n\nCase 2: $|S|=2$. Consider possible placements of the two removed vertices.\n\n- Subcase 2a: Both removed vertices lie in the same part, say $S=\\{A_{i},A_{j}\\}$ with $i\\neq j$. The remaining vertices are $A_{k}$ and all three $B$-vertices, with $\\{i,j,k\\}=\\{1,2,3\\}$. The edges present include the full $B$-triangle and the matching edge $A_{k}B_{k}$. Therefore $A_{k}$ is attached to the $B$-triangle via $A_{k}B_{k}$, and the whole graph is connected. The case $S\\subset V_{B}$ is analogous.\n\n- Subcase 2b: One removed from each part, and they are corresponding: $S=\\{A_{i},B_{i}\\}$. The remaining vertices are $\\{A_{j},A_{k},B_{j},B_{k}\\}$ with $\\{i,j,k\\}=\\{1,2,3\\}$. The edges present are $A_{j}A_{k}$, $B_{j}B_{k}$, and the two matching edges $A_{j}B_{j}$ and $A_{k}B_{k}$. These four vertices form the 4-cycle $A_{j}-B_{j}-B_{k}-A_{k}-A_{j}$, which is connected.\n\n- Subcase 2c: One removed from each part, and they are non-corresponding: $S=\\{A_{i},B_{j}\\}$ with $i\\neq j$. The remaining vertices are $A_{j},A_{k},B_{i},B_{k}$ where $\\{i,j,k\\}=\\{1,2,3\\}$ and $i\\neq j$. The edges present include $A_{j}A_{k}$ (from the $A$-triangle), $B_{i}B_{k}$ (from the $B$-triangle), and the matching edge $A_{k}B_{k}$ (since neither endpoint is removed). Then $A_{j}$ connects to $A_{k}$, which connects to $B_{k}$ via the matching, which connects to $B_{i}$ via the $B$-triangle edge. Hence the remaining graph is connected.\n\nIn all cases with $|S|\\leq 2$, the graph remains connected. Therefore,\n$$\n\\kappa(G)\\geq 3.\n$$\n\nFinally, to witness that removal of three vertices can disconnect $G$, take $S=N(A_{1})=\\{A_{2},A_{3},B_{1}\\}$. Removing $S$ leaves $A_{1}$ isolated and the edge $B_{2}B_{3}$, so the remaining graph has at least two components.

Let's test each vertex type in $G$.\n- Vertices $v_1, v_4, a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2$: These are all of degree 2 or less (in the case of $v_1, v_4$). Removing any of them (e.g., $v_1$) will not disconnect the remaining graph. For instance, removing $v_1$ leaves the rest of the graph connected through the path starting from $v_2$. Removing $a_1$ leaves $v_2$ and $a_2$ connected via their direct edge. So, these are not cut vertices.\n- Vertex $v_2$: The vertex $v_2$ connects the edge $(v_1, v_2)$, the edge $(v_2, v_3)$, and the triangle on $\\{v_2, a_1, a_2\\}$. If we remove $v_2$, the vertex $v_1$ becomes isolated from the rest of the graph. The vertices $a_1$ and $a_2$ are only connected to each other and are isolated from the rest. The path starting from $v_3$ is also a separate component. Therefore, removing $v_2$ disconnects the graph, making $v_2$ a cut vertex.\n- Vertex $v_3$: Similarly, $v_3$ connects the edge $(v_2, v_3)$, the edge $(v_3, v_4)$, and the triangle on $\\{v_3, b_1, b_2\\}$. Removing $v_3$ disconnects $v_4$, the triangle vertices $\\{b_1, b_2\\}$, and the path from $v_2$. So, $v_3$ is also a cut vertex.\n\nThe set of cut vertices of $G$ is $\\{v_2, v_3\\}$. There are exactly two cut vertices. This already confirms that statement D is correct. We will continue the analysis to verify that the other statements are incorrect.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Blocks of G**\nBlocks are maximal 2-connected subgraphs or bridges. We can find them by identifying edge sets that lie on common simple cycles, or edges that are bridges.\n- **Block 1 ($B_1$)**: The edges $\\{(v_2, a_1), (a_1, a_2), (a_2, v_2)\\}$ form a cycle (a triangle). This is a 2-connected subgraph. It is maximal because adding any other adjacent vertex (like $v_1$ or $v_3$) and its edge to $v_2$ would make $v_2$ a cut vertex of the new subgraph. So, the subgraph induced by vertices $\\{v_2, a_1, a_2\\}$ is a block.\n- **Block 2 ($B_2$)**: Similarly, the edges $\\{(v_3, b_1), (b_1, b_2), (b_2, v_3)\\}$ form a triangle. The subgraph induced by vertices $\\{v_3, b_1, b_2\\}$ is another block.\n- **Block 3 ($B_3$)**: The edge $(v_1, v_2)$ is not part of any cycle. It is a bridge. Therefore, it forms a block by itself. The subgraph with vertices $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ and edge $(v_1, v_2)$ is a block.\n- **Block 4 ($B_4$)**: The edge $(v_2, v_3)$ connects the two cut vertices. It is not part of any simple cycle in $G$. Therefore, it is a bridge between the larger components around $v_2$ and $v_3$ and forms a block by itself. The subgraph with vertices $\\{v_2, v_3\\}$ and edge $(v_2, v_3)$ is a block.\n- **Block 5 ($B_5$)**: The edge $(v_3, v_4)$ is not part of any cycle. It is a bridge. It forms a block by itself. The subgraph with vertices $\\{v_3, v_4\\}$ and edge $(v_3, v_4)$ is a block.\n\nSo, there are 5 blocks in $G$.\n\n**Step 3: Construct the Block-Cut Tree T(G)**\nThe vertices of $T(G)$ are the cut vertices and the blocks of $G$.\n- Cut vertex nodes: $v_2, v_3$.\n- Block nodes: $B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4, B_5$.\nThe total number of nodes in $T(G)$ is $2 + 5 = 7$.\n- This immediately shows that statement E, \"The tree $T(G)$ has a total of 8 nodes,\" is incorrect.\n\nThe edges of $T(G)$ connect a block node to a cut-vertex node if the vertex is in the block.\n- Cut vertex $v_2$ is in blocks $B_1$ (triangle), $B_3$ (edge to $v_1$), and $B_4$ (edge to $v_3$). So, $T(G)$ has edges $(v_2, B_1)$, $(v_2, B_3)$, and $(v_2, B_4)$.\n- Cut vertex $v_3$ is in blocks $B_2$ (triangle), $B_4$ (edge to $v_2$), and $B_5$ (edge to $v_4$). So, $T(G)$ has edges $(v_3, B_2)$, $(v_3, B_4)$, and $(v_3, B_5)$.\n\nThe structure of T(G) is:\n$B_1 - v_2 - B_4 - v_3 - B_2$\nwith $B_3$ also connected to $v_2$, and $B_5$ also connected to $v_3$.\nThe tree can be drawn as:\n$B_3 - v_2 - B_4 - v_3 - B_5$\n      $|$          $|$\n     $B_1$        $B_2$\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Properties of T(G) and Evaluate the Options**\n\n- **A.
