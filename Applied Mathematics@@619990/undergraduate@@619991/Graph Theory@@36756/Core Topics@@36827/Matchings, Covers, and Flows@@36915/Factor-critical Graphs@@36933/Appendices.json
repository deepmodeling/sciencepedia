By definition, a connected graph $G$ with $|V(G)|$ odd is factor-critical if and only if for every vertex $v \\in V(G)$ the graph $G-v$ has a perfect matching. A perfect matching can exist only in a graph with an even number of vertices, and in a disconnected graph a perfect matching exists if and only if each connected component has a perfect matching.\n\nOption A: $K_{5}$. This graph is connected and has $|V(K_{5})|=5$ (odd). For any vertex $v$, $K_{5}-v \\cong K_{4}$. The complete graph $K_{2k}$ has a perfect matching by pairing vertices arbitrarily, so $K_{4}$ has a perfect matching. Therefore $K_{5}$ is factor-critical.\n\nOption B: $C_{7}$. This graph is connected and has $|V(C_{7})|=7$ (odd). For any vertex $v$, $C_{7}-v \\cong P_{6}$. The path $P_6$ has a perfect matching by taking every other edge along the path. Hence $C_7-v$ has a perfect matching, so $C_7$ is factor-critical.\n\nOption C: Two disjoint copies of $K_{3}$ with a new vertex $v$ adjacent to exactly one vertex in each triangle. The graph is connected because $v$ joins the two triangles, and it has $3+3+1=7$ vertices (odd). Consider removing the special vertex $v$. Then $G-v$ is the disjoint union $K_{3} \\cup K_{3}$. Each $K_{3}$ has no perfect matching (it has $3$ vertices), and there are no edges between the components. Thus $G-v$ has no perfect matching. Therefore this graph is not factor-critical.\n\nOption D: $W_{7}$. This graph is connected and has $|V(W_{7})|=7$ (odd). If we remove the center, we get $C_{6}$, which has a perfect matching. If we remove any rim vertex $r$, the remaining rim forms a path on $5$ vertices, and the center is adjacent to all $5$; match the center to one endpoint of the path and complete the matching along the path by two disjoint edges. Hence $W_{7}-r$ has a perfect matching for any rim $r$, so $W_{7}$ is factor-critical.\n\nTherefore, the only option that is connected, has an odd number of vertices, and is not factor-critical is Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1503670"}, {"introduction": "Having grasped the basic definition, we now explore the relationship between factor-criticality and other important graph properties like connectivity.

A graph is 2-connected if it has at least three vertices and remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. A graph $G$ is factor-critical if for every vertex $v$, the graph $G-v$ has a perfect matching.\n\nWe test each option against the statement to find a 2-connected graph with an odd number of vertices that is not factor-critical.\n\nFor $C_{5}$, the graph has 5 vertices and is 2-connected because every cycle is 2-connected. For any vertex $v$, the graph $C_{5}-v$ is a path on 4 vertices, which has a perfect matching (for instance, the two disjoint edges between consecutive vertices at the ends), so $C_{5}$ is factor-critical. Thus $C_{5}$ is not a counterexample.\n\nFor $K_{5}$, the graph has 5 vertices and is 2-connected. For any vertex $v$, the graph $K_{5}-v$ is $K_{4}$, which has a perfect matching. Hence $K_{5}$ is factor-critical and not a counterexample.\n\nFor $K_{2,3}$, the graph has 5 vertices and its vertex-connectivity equals $\\min\\{2,3\\}=2$, so it is 2-connected. To test factor-criticality, remove a vertex from the part of size $2$, say $a_{1}$. Then $G-a_{1}$ is $K_{1,3}$, a bipartite graph with parts of sizes $1$ and $3$. In any bipartite graph with bipartition $(X,Y)$, a perfect matching can exist only if $|X|=|Y|$, since a perfect matching must saturate both sides. Here $|X|=1$ and $|Y|=3$, so no perfect matching exists in $K_{1,3}$. Therefore $K_{2,3}$ is not factor-critical, and this violates the proposition while maintaining 2-connectedness and an odd number of vertices. Hence $K_{2,3}$ is a counterexample.\n\nFor $W_{7}$, the graph has 7 vertices and is 2-connected (indeed, wheel graphs with at least 4 rim vertices are at least 3-connected). Removing the center yields $C_{6}$, which has a perfect matching. Removing any rim vertex yields a graph consisting of the center adjacent to the 5 remaining rim vertices with the rim forming a path on 5 vertices; one can form a perfect matching by matching the center to the middle rim vertex and pairing the remaining rim vertices along the path.
