This exercise sharpens your understanding by creating a scenario where the shortest geometric path between two points is not an M-alternating path. By comparing the length of a standard shortest path, $L_S$, with the length of the shortest $M$-alternating path, $L_A$, you will learn to prioritize the crucial pattern of alternating edges over simple distance, a foundational skill for applying Berge's Lemma [@problem_id:1482977].", "problem": "Consider an undirected simple graph $G = (V, E)$ where the vertex set is $V = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5, v_6, v_7, v_8, v_9\\}$ and the edge set is $E = \\{\\{v_1, v_2\\}, \\{v_2, v_3\\}, \\{v_3, v_4\\}, \\{v_4, v_5\\}, \\{v_5, v_6\\}, \\{v_6, v_7\\}, \\{v_7, v_8\\}, \\{v_1, v_9\\}, \\{v_9, v_8\\}\\}$.\n\nA matching $M$ in $G$ is a subset of $E$ where no two edges share a common vertex. We are given the matching $M = \\{\\{v_2, v_3\\}, \\{v_4, v_5\\}, \\{v_6, v_7\\}\\}$.\nThe following definitions are used:\n- A vertex is called $M$-exposed if it is not an endpoint of any edge in the matching $M$.\n- A path in $G$ is a sequence of distinct vertices; its length is the number of edges it contains.\n- A path is $M$-alternating if its edges alternate between those that are not in $M$ and those that are in $M$.\n\nLet $L_S$ be the length of a shortest path in the graph $G$ between vertices $v_1$ and $v_8$.\nLet $L_A$ be the length of a shortest $M$-alternating path between vertices $v_1$ and $v_8$.\n\nDetermine the numerical values of $L_S$ and $L_A$.

In addition, there are edges $\\{v_1,v_9\\}$ and $\\{v_9,v_8\\}$, providing a two-edge connection between $v_1$ and $v_8$ via $v_9$. The given matching is $M=\\{\\{v_2,v_3\\},\\{v_4,v_5\\},\\{v_6,v_7\\}\\}$.\n\nTo determine $L_S$, the length of a shortest path between $v_1$ and $v_8$, observe that there is no edge $\\{v_1,v_8\\}$, so a path of length $1$ does not exist. The path $v_1-v_9-v_8$ has length $2$, hence $L_S \\leq 2$. Any path along the chain $v_1-v_2-v_3-v_4-v_5-v_6-v_7-v_8$ has length $7$, which is longer. Therefore the shortest possible length is achieved by $v_1-v_9-v_8$, and we conclude $L_S=2$.\n\nTo determine $L_A$, the length of a shortest $M$-alternating path between $v_1$ and $v_8$, recall that an $M$-alternating path must have its edges alternating between those not in $M$ and those in $M$. The edges incident to $v_9$, namely $\\{v_1,v_9\\}$ and $\\{v_9,v_8\\}$, are not in $M$. If a path uses $v_9$ internally, it would necessarily traverse two consecutive edges not in $M$, violating alternation. Moreover, starting at $v_1$, any first edge is not in $M$ (either $\\{v_1,v_2\\}$ or $\\{v_1,v_9\\}$), and from $v_9$ there is no edge in $M$, so no $M$-alternating path can include $v_9$. Hence any $M$-alternating path from $v_1$ to $v_8$ must lie entirely on the chain $v_1,v_2,\\dots,v_8$.\n\nAlong this chain, the membership of edges in $M$ alternates as follows:\n$\\{v_1,v_2\\} \\notin M$, $\\{v_2,v_3\\} \\in M$, $\\{v_3,v_4\\} \\notin M$, $\\{v_4,v_5\\} \\in M$, $\\{v_5,v_6\\} \\notin M$, $\\{v_6,v_7\\} \\in M$, $\\{v_7,v_8\\} \\notin M$.\nTherefore, the unique simple path $v_1-v_2-v_3-v_4-v_5-v_6-v_7-v_8$ is $M$-alternating and has length $7$. Since no path using $v_9$ can be alternating and there is no shorter simple path between $v_1$ and $v_8$ on the chain, this is the shortest $M$-alternating path. Thus $L_A=7$.\n\nCombining the results gives $(L_S,L_A)=(2,7)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 7 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1482977"}, {"introduction": "Now that we grasp the nature of alternating paths, let's focus on identifying the specific type that allows us to enlarge a matching: the $M$-augmenting path.
