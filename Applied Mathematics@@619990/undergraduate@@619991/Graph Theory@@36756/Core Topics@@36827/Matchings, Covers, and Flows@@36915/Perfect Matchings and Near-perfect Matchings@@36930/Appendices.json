Before we can count perfect matchings or prove complex theorems about them, it is essential to be able to identify the size of a maximum matching in basic graph structures.

A **maximum matching** is a matching that contains the largest possible number of edges for the given graph $G$. The size of a maximum matching is often denoted by $\\alpha'(G)$.\n\nConsider a system with 6 nodes, where connections between nodes can be represented by a simple undirected graph with a vertex set $V$ of size $|V|=6$. You are presented with four different possible network configurations. Your task is to identify which configuration results in a graph where the size of a maximum matching is exactly 2.\n\nWhich of the following graphs on 6 vertices has a maximum matching of size 2?\n\nA. The cycle graph on 6 vertices, denoted $C_6$. This is a connected graph where every vertex has a degree of exactly 2.\nB. The complete bipartite graph $K_{3,3}$.

The star graph $K_{1,5}$. This graph has a central vertex connected to the other 5 vertices, and no other edges exist.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine which of the four described graphs on 6 vertices has a maximum matching of size 2. A matching is a set of edges with no common vertices, and a maximum matching has the largest possible size. Let the vertex set be $V = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5, v_6\\}$. We will analyze each option.\n\n**Analysis of Option A: The cycle graph $C_6$**\nA cycle graph $C_6$ can be described by the vertex set $V$ and the edge set $E = \\{(v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3), (v_3, v_4), (v_4, v_5), (v_5, v_6), (v_6, v_1)\\}$. We are looking for the maximum number of edges that do not share any vertices.\nConsider the set of edges $M_A = \\{(v_1, v_2), (v_3, v_4), (v_5, v_6)\\}$.\nThe vertices involved in $(v_1, v_2)$ are $v_1$ and $v_2$.\nThe vertices involved in $(v_3, v_4)$ are $v_3$ and $v_4$.\nThe vertices involved in $(v_5, v_6)$ are $v_5$ and $v_6$.\nNo two edges in $M_A$ share a common vertex, so $M_A$ is a matching. The size of this matching is $|M_A| = 3$.\nA matching of size 3 in a graph with 6 vertices covers all 6 vertices (since each edge covers 2 vertices, $3 \\times 2 = 6$). Such a matching is called a perfect matching. Since a perfect matching covers all vertices, it is not possible to add any more edges to it. Therefore, a perfect matching is always a maximum matching.\nThe size of the maximum matching for $C_6$ is 3. This is not 2, so option A is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option B: The complete bipartite graph $K_{3,3}$**\nThe vertex set is partitioned into two sets, say $U = \\{u_1, u_2, u_3\\}$ and $W = \\{w_1, w_2, w_3\\}$. An edge exists between every vertex in $U$ and every vertex in $W$.\nWe can construct a matching by pairing each vertex in $U$ with a unique vertex in $W$. For example, consider the set of edges $M_B = \\{(u_1, w_1), (u_2, w_2), (u_3, w_3)\\}$.\nThis is a valid matching because each edge connects a distinct vertex from $U$ to a distinct vertex from $W$, so no two edges share a vertex. The size of this matching is $|M_B|=3$.\nSimilar to option A, this is a perfect matching because it covers all 6 vertices of the graph. Therefore, the size of the maximum matching for $K_{3,3}$ is 3. This is not 2, so option B is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option C: A graph of two disjoint $C_3$ components**\nThe graph consists of two separate components that are not connected. Each component is a cycle on 3 vertices (a triangle). Let the first component have vertices $V_1 = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$ and edges $E_1 = \\{(v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3), (v_3, v_1)\\}$. Let the second component have vertices $V_2 = \\{v_4, v_5, v_6\\}$ and edges $E_2 = \\{(v_4, v_5), (v_5, v_6), (v_6, v_4)\\}$.\nLet's find the maximum matching for the first component ($C_3$). If we choose any edge, say $(v_1, v_2)$, it covers vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$. The only remaining vertex is $v_3$. The only edges connected to $v_3$ are $(v_2, v_3)$ and $(v_3, v_1)$, both of which are incident to a vertex that is already covered by the edge $(v_1, v_2)$. Therefore, no more edges can be added to the matching. The maximum matching for a single $C_3$ has a size of 1.\nSince the two $C_3$ components are disjoint (share no vertices or edges), a matching in the overall graph is the union of a matching from the first component and a matching from the second component. To get the maximum matching for the entire graph, we take the maximum matching from each component.\nMaximum matching for the first $C_3$: size 1 (e.g., $\\{(v_1, v_2)\\}$).\nMaximum matching for the second $C_3$: size 1 (e.g., $\\{(v_4, v_5)\\}$).\nCombining these gives a matching for the whole graph: $M_C = \\{(v_1, v_2), (v_4, v_5)\\}$. The size of this matching is $1 + 1 = 2$.\nThis is the maximum possible size, because we can select at most one edge from each triangle. Thus, the size of the maximum matching is 2. This matches the requirement, so option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Analysis of Option D: The star graph $K_{1,5}$**\nThis graph has a central vertex, let's call it $v_c$, and 5 other \"leaf\" vertices, $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5\\}$. The edge set is $E = \\{(v_c, v_1), (v_c, v_2), (v_c, v_3), (v_c, v_4), (v_c, v_5)\\}$.\nTo form a matching, we select a set of edges that do not share vertices. All edges in this graph share the common central vertex $v_c$.\nIf we select any single edge, for instance $(v_c, v_1)$, the vertex $v_c$ is now covered. Since every other edge in the graph is also incident to $v_c$, no other edge can be added to the matching.\nTherefore, any matching in a star graph can contain at most one edge. A maximum matching consists of any single edge, for example $M_D = \\{(v_c, v_1)\\}$. The size of the maximum matching is 1. This is not 2, so option D is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis of all four options, only the graph described in option C has a maximum matching of size 2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1526765"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simply finding the size of a maximum matching, this practice challenges you to enumerate all possible perfect matchings in a given network.
