It also severs the connection from this chain to vertex 1.

These are the \"leaf\" vertices of the chains. Let's test $v=2$. The graph $G-\\{2\\}$ consists of a single connected component of 9 vertices (e.g., vertex 3 is still connected to 4 and 1, keeping everything linked). A single component with 9 vertices is an odd component. So, $o(G-\\{2\\}) = 1$. The candidate value is $T_2 = 1 - 1 = 0$. By symmetry, this holds for all other vertices in this case.\n\n4.

Removing vertex 3 from component $C_a$ splits it into two new components: $\\{2\\}$ and $\\{4\\}$. Both are single-vertex components and are therefore odd.
