Present your answer as the ordered pair $(\\alpha'(G), \\beta(G))$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the matching number $\\alpha'(G)$ and the vertex cover number $\\beta(G)$ of a specific graph $G$.\n\nFirst, let's explicitly construct the graph $G=(V, E)$.\nThe vertex set $V$ consists of all 2-element subsets of $S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The number of such subsets is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6$. The vertices are:\n$v_1 = \\{1, 2\\}$\n$v_2 = \\{1, 3\\}$\n$v_3 = \\{1, 4\\}$\n$v_4 = \\{2, 3\\}$\n$v_5 = \\{2, 4\\}$\n$v_6 = \\{3, 4\\}$\n\nThe edge set $E$ contains pairs of vertices $\\{A, B\\}$ such that $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$. Let's find the edges by checking each pair of vertices for the disjointness condition.\n- For $v_1 = \\{1, 2\\}$, the only 2-element subset of $S$ disjoint from it is $\\{3, 4\\} = v_6$. So, there is an edge $(v_1, v_6)$.\n- For $v_2 = \\{1, 3\\}$, the only 2-element subset of $S$ disjoint from it is $\\{2, 4\\} = v_5$. So, there is an edge $(v_2, v_5)$.\n- For $v_3 = \\{1, 4\\}$, the only 2-element subset of $S$ disjoint from it is $\\{2, 3\\} = v_4$. So, there is an edge $(v_3, v_4)$.\nChecking other pairs would be redundant. For example, for $v_4=\\{2,3\\}$, its disjoint counterpart is $\\{1,4\\}=v_3$, which we have already found.\nSo, the graph $G$ has 6 vertices and the following 3 edges:\n$E = \\{(\\{1, 2\\}, \\{3, 4\\}), (\\{1, 3\\}, \\{2, 4\\}), (\\{1, 4\\}, \\{2, 3\\})\\}$\nThis graph consists of three separate edges.\n\nNext, we find the matching number $\\alpha'(G)$.\nA matching is a set of edges with no common vertices. The set of all edges in our graph is $M = E = \\{(\\{1, 2\\}, \\{3, 4\\}), (\\{1, 3\\}, \\{2, 4\\}), (\\{1, 4\\}, \\{2, 3\\})\\}$. Let's check if this set $M$ is a matching.\nThe vertices involved in the first edge are $\\{1, 2\\}$ and $\\{3, 4\\}$.\nThe vertices involved in the second edge are $\\{1, 3\\}$ and $\\{2, 4\\}$.\nThe vertices involved in the third edge are $\\{1, 4\\}$ and $\\{2, 3\\}$.\nAll six vertices of the graph are distinct. Therefore, no two edges in $M$ share a common vertex. This means $M$ is a matching.\nSince $M$ includes all edges of the graph $G$, it is by definition a maximum matching. The size of this matching is the number of edges in it, which is 3.\nThus, the matching number is $\\alpha'(G) = 3$.\n\nNow, we find the vertex cover number $\\beta(G)$.\nA vertex cover is a set of vertices $C \\subseteq V$ such that every edge is incident to at least one vertex in $C$. We are looking for the minimum size of such a set.\nThe edges are $e_1 = (\\{1, 2\\}, \\{3, 4\\})$, $e_2 = (\\{1, 3\\}, \\{2, 4\\})$, and $e_3 = (\\{1, 4\\}, \\{2, 3\\})$.\nThese three edges are vertex-disjoint.\nTo cover edge $e_1$, a vertex cover must contain either vertex $\\{1, 2\\}$ or vertex $\\{3, 4\\}$.\nTo cover edge $e_2$, a vertex cover must contain either vertex $\\{1, 3\\}$ or vertex $\\{2, 4\\}$.\nTo cover edge $e_3$, a vertex cover must contain either vertex $\\{1, 4\\}$ or vertex $\\{2, 3\\}$.\nSince these choices are independent for each edge (because the edges are disjoint), we must select at least one vertex for each of the three edges. Therefore, any vertex cover must have at least 3 vertices. This establishes a lower bound: $\\beta(G) \\ge 3$.\n\nLet's try to construct a vertex cover of size 3. We can do this by picking one vertex from each edge. For example, let's choose the set $C = \\{\\{1, 2\\}, \\{1, 3\\}, \\{1, 4\\}\\}$.\n- Edge $e_1 = (\\{1, 2\\}, \\{3, 4\\})$ is incident to $\\{1, 2\\}$, which is in $C$. So $e_1$ is covered.\n- Edge $e_2 = (\\{1, 3\\}, \\{2, 4\\})$ is incident to $\\{1, 3\\}$, which is in $C$. So $e_2$ is covered.\n- Edge $e_3 = (\\{1, 4\\}, \\{2, 3\\})$ is incident to $\\{1, 4\\}$, which is in $C$. So $e_3$ is covered.\nSince all edges are covered, $C$ is a valid vertex cover. The size of $C$ is $|C| = 3$.\nSince we have found a vertex cover of size 3, and we know that the size of any vertex cover must be at least 3, the minimum possible size for a vertex cover is 3.\nThus, the vertex cover number is $\\beta(G) = 3$.\n\nThe ordered pair is $(\\alpha'(G), \\beta(G)) = (3, 3)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(3, 3)}$$", "id": "1531348"}, {"introduction": "While some graphs, like the one in our first practice, exhibit equality between the matching number and vertex cover number, this is not a universal truth.
