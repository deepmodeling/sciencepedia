This first exercise [@problem_id:1506375] provides a direct application of Gallai's first identity, $\\alpha(G) + \\tau(G) = n$. By working through a practical scenario involving network maintenance and security, you will see how determining the size of a maximum set of non-adjacent vertices (an independent set) immediately allows you to find the size of the minimum set of vertices required to \"cover\" every connection (a vertex cover).", "problem": "A technology company is designing a new internal network architecture consisting of 12 identical server hubs. The network topology is structured such that every hub is connected by a direct fiber-optic link to exactly 3 other distinct hubs.\n\nFor maintenance planning, the network administrators need to determine the maximum number of hubs that can be shut down simultaneously for upgrades, under the strict constraint that no two hubs chosen for shutdown are directly connected by a fiber-optic link. Through analysis, they have determined this maximum number to be 5.\n\nFor network security monitoring, the company must install a special intrusion detection system (IDS) on a selection of hubs. The installation must guarantee that every single fiber-optic link in the network is incident to at least one hub running the IDS. To minimize costs, they wish to find the absolute minimum number of hubs that must be equipped with the IDS to satisfy this monitoring requirement.\n\nWhat is this minimum number of hubs required for the IDS installation?", "solution": "Let the network be modeled by a graph $G=(V,E)$ with $|V|=12$, where vertices are hubs and edges are fiber-optic links. The requirement that no two simultaneously shut-down hubs are directly connected describes an independent set. The given maximum number of such hubs is the independence number, so $\\alpha(G)=5$.\n\nAn IDS placement that ensures every link is incident to at least one instrumented hub is a vertex cover $C \\subseteq V$, i.e., every edge in $E$ has at least one endpoint in $C$. The minimum number of hubs needed is the minimum vertex cover size $\\tau(G)$.\n\nWe use the standard relationship between independence number and vertex cover:\n- If $S \\subseteq V$ is an independent set, then $V \\setminus S$ is a vertex cover. Proof: if some edge had neither endpoint in $V \\setminus S$, then both endpoints would be in $S$, contradicting that $S$ is independent. Hence, taking a maximum independent set of size $\\alpha(G)$, we obtain a vertex cover of size $|V|-\\alpha(G)$, so\n$$\n\\tau(G) \\leq |V| - \\alpha(G).\n$$\n- Conversely, if $C \\subseteq V$ is a vertex cover, then $V \\setminus C$ is an independent set. Proof: if there were an edge with both endpoints in $V \\setminus C$, that edge would not be covered by $C$, a contradiction. Hence taking a minimum vertex cover of size $\\tau(G)$ yields an independent set of size $|V|-\\tau(G)$, so\n$$\n\\alpha(G) \\geq |V| - \\tau(G).\n$$\nCombining the two inequalities gives the equality\n$$\n\\tau(G) = |V| - \\alpha(G).\n$$\n\nSubstituting $|V|=12$ and $\\alpha(G)=5$,\n$$\n\\tau(G) = 12 - 5 = 7.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of hubs that must be equipped with the IDS is $7$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7}$$", "id": "1506375"}, {"introduction": "Similar to the duality between vertex sets, there is an equally important relationship concerning edge sets. This problem [@problem_id:1506391] focuses on Gallai's second identity, $\\alpha'(G) + \\rho(G) = n$, which connects the maximum number of disjoint edges (a matching) to the minimum number of edges needed to touch every vertex (an edge cover). This practice will help you grasp how finding the network's maximum concurrent communication capacity directly informs the minimum resources needed for a complete monitoring setup.", "problem": "A company manages a private communication network composed of 15 nodes interconnected by physical links. For security reasons, when communication channels are active, no single node can be part of more than one active link at a time. A set of links that can be simultaneously active under this rule is called a valid communication set. After a thorough analysis of the network's structure, it has been determined that the maximum number of links in any valid communication set is 6.\n\nSeparately, for maintenance purposes, the company needs to select a subset of links to form a 'monitoring cover'. A monitoring cover is a set of links chosen such that every node in the network is an endpoint of at least one link within the cover. The network has been designed such that there are no isolated nodes.\n\nWhat is the minimum possible number of links required to form a monitoring cover?", "solution": "Model the network as a simple graph $G$ with $n=15$ vertices (nodes) and edges (links). A valid communication set is a matching, i.e., a set of pairwise disjoint edges. The given statement that the maximum number of links in any valid communication set is $6$ means the maximum matching number is $\\alpha'(G)=6$. A monitoring cover is an edge cover, i.e., a set of edges whose endpoints collectively include every vertex. Let the minimum size of an edge cover be denoted by $\\rho(G)$.\n\nKey fact for graphs with no isolated vertices: \n$$\\rho(G)=n-\\alpha'(G).$$\n\nDerivation of the formula:\n1. Upper bound $\\rho(G)\\leq n-\\alpha'(G)$: Let $M$ be a maximum matching with $|M|=\\alpha'(G)$. Then $M$ covers $2\\alpha'(G)$ vertices, leaving $n-2\\alpha'(G)$ vertices unmatched. Because there are no isolated vertices, for each unmatched vertex $v$ there exists at least one edge incident to $v$; add one such edge to the set. Let $C$ be the resulting set of edges. Then\n$$|C|=|M|+(n-2\\alpha'(G))=\\alpha'(G)+n-2\\alpha'(G)=n-\\alpha'(G),$$\nand $C$ is an edge cover. Hence $\\rho(G)\\leq n-\\alpha'(G)$.\n\n2. Lower bound $\\rho(G)\\geq n-\\alpha'(G)$: Let $C$ be any edge cover. Extract a matching $M'\\subseteq C$ by choosing disjoint edges greedily until no more can be added; then $M'$ is a maximal matching within $C$, and $|M'|\\leq\\alpha'(G)$. The edges of $M'$ cover $2|M'|$ vertices, leaving $n-2|M'|$ vertices not incident to any edge of $M'$. Each of these remaining vertices must be covered by some edge of $C$, and any such edge can contribute at most one new vertex to the covered set (its other endpoint is already covered by maximality of $M'$). Therefore\n$$|C|\\geq |M'|+(n-2|M'|)=n-|M'|\\geq n-\\alpha'(G).$$\nCombining both bounds gives $\\rho(G)=n-\\alpha'(G)$.\n\nApplying to this network with $n=15$ and $\\alpha'(G)=6$:\n$$\\rho(G)=15-6=9.$$\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible number of links required for a monitoring cover is $9$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9}$$", "id": "1506391"}, {"introduction": "Now that we've explored the two Gallai identities separately, let's bring them together in a concrete example.

A matching cannot contain two edges incident to the same vertex, so at most one edge incident to $v_{2}$ and at most one edge incident to $v_{3}$ can be included.
