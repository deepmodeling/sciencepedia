For any $S \\subseteq U$, count edges between $S$ and $N(S)$. From the $U$-side, there are exactly $k|S|$ edges from $S$ to $V$. All such edges end in $N(S)$, so the number of edges between $S$ and $N(S)$ is $k|S|$. From the $V$-side, each vertex in $N(S)$ has degree $k$, so the number of edges from $N(S)$ into $U$ is at most $k|N(S)|$.
