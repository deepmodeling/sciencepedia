The proposed cover is $C=\\{u_{1},u_{2},u_{3},u_{4}\\}$. Every edge of $E$ is of the form $(u_{i},v_{j})$ and contains its $U$-endpoint $u_{i}$, which lies in $C$. Thus $C$ is a vertex cover.

Let $L_{max}(n)$ be the maximum number of links that can be tested in a single session for a network of $n$ nodes.\n\n2.  **Network Monitoring:** For security purposes, monitoring devices must be installed at some of the nodes.

A lower bound arises from any set of pairwise edge-disjoint edges, since each such edge needs a distinct endpoint in the cover. Using the disjoint edge set $(v_{1},v_{2}), (v_{3},v_{4}), \\ldots$ shows that any vertex cover has size at least $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor$.
