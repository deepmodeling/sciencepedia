A scanner placed at node $v_i$ can monitor all communication links that are directly connected to it. A \"fully monitored network\" is one where every single communication link is monitored by at least one scanner.\n\nYour task is to determine the minimum number of security scanners required to create a fully monitored network. Express your answer as a single, closed-form analytic expression in terms of $n$.", "solution": "Let us model the network of server nodes and communication links as a graph. The server nodes represent the vertices $V = \\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n\\}$ and the communication links represent the edges $E = \\{(v_i, v_{i+1}) \\mid 1 \\le i < n\\}$. This graph is a path graph on $n$ vertices, denoted as $P_n$.\n\nA security scanner at a node $v_i$ covers all incident edges. A \"fully monitored network\" corresponds to a set of vertices $C \\subseteq V$ such that every edge in $E$ has at least one of its endpoints in $C$. In graph theory, this set $C$ is known as a vertex cover. The problem asks for the size of a minimum vertex cover for the path graph $P_n$. Let this quantity be denoted by $\\tau(P_n)$.\n\nFirst, we establish a lower bound for $\\tau(P_n)$. The path graph $P_n$ has $|E| = n-1$ edges. In $P_n$, the two endpoint vertices ($v_1$ and $v_n$) have a degree of 1, and all intermediate vertices ($v_2, \\dots, v_{n-1}$) have a degree of 2. Therefore, any single vertex can cover at most 2 edges. If we have a vertex cover of size $k$, the total number of edges covered is at most $2k$. To cover all $n-1$ edges, we must satisfy the inequality:\n$$2k \\ge n-1$$\nThis implies that $k \\ge \\frac{n-1}{2}$. Since $k$ must be an integer, we have:\n$$\\tau(P_n) \\ge \\left\\lceil \\frac{n-1}{2} \\right\\rceil$$\n\nNext, we establish an upper bound for $\\tau(P_n)$ by constructing a valid vertex cover. Consider the set of vertices with even-numbered indices:\n$$C = \\{v_{2i} \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+, 2i \\le n\\}$$\nLet's verify if this set $C$ is a vertex cover. An arbitrary edge in $P_n$ is of the form $(v_j, v_{j+1})$ for $1 \\le j < n$. For any such integer $j$, one of the two consecutive integers $j$ or $j+1$ must be even.\n- If $j$ is even, then the vertex $v_j$ is in our set $C$. Thus, the edge $(v_j, v_{j+1})$ is covered.\n- If $j$ is odd, then $j+1$ is even. In this case, the vertex $v_{j+1}$ is in our set $C$. Thus, the edge $(v_j, v_{j+1})$ is covered.\nSince every edge in $P_n$ has at least one endpoint with an even index, the set $C$ is a valid vertex cover.\n\nNow, let's find the size of this constructed cover, $|C|$. The vertices in $C$ are $v_2, v_4, v_6, \\dots$. The largest index is the largest even number less than or equal to $n$, which is $2 \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor$. The number of elements in the set $\\{2, 4, \\dots, 2\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor\\}$ is $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor$.\nSo, we have found a vertex cover of size $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor$. This provides an upper bound on the minimum size:\n$$\\tau(P_n) \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor$$\n\nCombining our lower and upper bounds, we have:\n$$\\left\\lceil \\frac{n-1}{2} \\right\\rceil \\le \\tau(P_n) \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor$$\n\nLet's show that the lower and upper bounds are equal. We can analyze this using two cases based on the parity of $n$.\n\nCase 1: $n$ is even. Let $n = 2m$ for some integer $m \\ge 1$.\nThe lower bound is $\\lceil \\frac{2m-1}{2} \\rceil = \\lceil m - \\frac{1}{2} \\rceil = m$.\nThe upper bound is $\\lfloor \\frac{2m}{2} \\rfloor = \\lfloor m \\rfloor = m$.\nIn this case, the bounds are equal, so $\\tau(P_{2m}) = m = \\frac{n}{2}$.\n\nCase 2: $n$ is odd. Let $n = 2m+1$ for some integer $m \\ge 0$.\nThe lower bound is $\\lceil \\frac{(2m+1)-1}{2} \\rceil = \\lceil \\frac{2m}{2} \\rceil = \\lceil m \\rceil = m$.\nThe upper bound is $\\lfloor \\frac{2m+1}{2} \\rfloor = \\lfloor m + \\frac{1}{2} \\rfloor = m$.\nIn this case, the bounds are also equal, so $\\tau(P_{2m+1}) = m = \\frac{n-1}{2}$.\n\nWe now need a single expression that works for both cases.\nIf $n=2m$, then $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{2m}{2} \\rfloor = m$. This matches our result for the even case.\nIf $n=2m+1$, then $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{2m+1}{2} \\rfloor = \\lfloor m + \\frac{1}{2} \\rfloor = m$. This matches our result for the odd case.\n\nThus, for any positive integer $n$, the size of the minimum vertex cover for a path graph $P_n$ is $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor}$$", "id": "1553528"}, {"introduction": "When tackling optimization problems, a common first instinct is to use a 'greedy' strategy, such as always picking the vertex with the highest degree.
