The search builds an alternating tree by labeling vertices. The root $r$ is labeled 'outer'. The search proceeds from an un-scanned 'outer' vertex $u$. For each neighbor $v$ of $u$:\n1.  If $v$ is in the tree and labeled 'inner', the edge $(u,v)$ is part of the tree structure and is ignored.\n2.  If $v$ is not in the tree and is a matched vertex (i.e., some edge $(v,w) \\in M$ exists), the path $u-v-w$ is added to the alternating tree.

If $v$ is in the tree and also labeled 'outer', an odd-length cycle, called a blossom, has been detected.\n\nTo ensure a deterministic search process, when exploring from an 'outer' vertex, you must consider its neighbors in increasing order of their vertex labels.
