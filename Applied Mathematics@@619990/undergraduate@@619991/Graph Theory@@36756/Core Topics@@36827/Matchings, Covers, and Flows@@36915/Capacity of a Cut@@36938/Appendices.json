The vertices $v_1, \\dots, v_n$ are intermediate relay nodes.\n\nThe connections in this network are directed and have specific capacities. They are categorized as follows:\n1.  **Direct links**: For each $i$ from $0$ to $n$, there is a directed edge from $v_i$ to $v_{i+1}$. The capacity of this edge, denoted $c(v_i, v_{i+1})$, is given by the formula $c(v_i, v_{i+1}) = \\alpha \\cdot 2^i$.\n2.  **Bypass links**: For each $i$ from $0$ to $n-1$, there is a directed edge from $v_i$ to $v_{i+2}$.
