It is adjacent to all four rim vertices, so\n$$\n\\deg(h)=4,\n$$\nwhich is even.\n- Let $v_{1},v_{2},v_{3},v_{4}$ be the rim vertices forming $C_{4}$.

Although $W_{5}$ is connected, it fails the necessary condition that all vertices have even degree, so it does not have an Eulerian circuit. Therefore, Hierholzer’s algorithm cannot be used to find an Eulerian circuit on $W_{5}$, and the correct explanation is that the graph contains vertices of odd degree.\n\nFor completeness, option C is false because $\\deg(h)=4$ is even; option B is false because $W_{5}$ is connected; option A is false because not all vertices have odd degree; and option E is irrelevant and false here since $|E(W_{5})|=4+4=8$ is even, and in any case the parity of the number of edges is not the Eulerian condition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1512112"}, {"introduction": "Having established the necessary conditions for an Eulerian circuit, the next step is to execute the algorithm itself.

By determining the minimum number of pathways to add, you will apply your knowledge of vertex degrees to solve a practical optimization problem, bridging the gap between graph theory and real-world design [@problem_id:1512155].", "problem": "An autonomous maintenance robot is tasked with inspecting a series of pathways in a facility. The layout of the pathways can be modeled as a graph. The robot must start at a designated service hub (a vertex), travel along every single pathway (edge) exactly once, and then return to its starting hub. Such a traversal is known as an Eulerian circuit.\n\nA key theorem in graph theory states that a connected graph possesses an Eulerian circuit if and only if every vertex in the graph has an even degree (i.e., an even number of edges connected to it).\n\nThe specific facility layout is modeled by a complete bipartite graph, denoted as $K_{m,n}$. In such a graph, the vertices are partitioned into two disjoint sets, a set $U$ of size $m$ and a set $V$ of size $n$. Every vertex in $U$ is connected to every vertex in $V$ by an edge, and no edges exist between vertices within the same set.\n\nConsider a network represented by the graph $K_{3,5}$. This initial configuration does not permit an Eulerian circuit. To resolve this, the facility manager can authorize the construction of additional pathways. An additional pathway is equivalent to adding an edge to the graph. This can be either a new, direct pathway between any two existing service hubs, or a duplication of an existing pathway.\n\nDetermine the minimum number of additional pathways (edges) that must be built so that the resulting network allows for an Eulerian circuit.", "solution": "An Eulerian circuit exists in a connected graph if and only if every vertex has even degree. The graph $K_{m,n}$ is connected and has the property that every vertex in the part of size $m$ has degree $n$, and every vertex in the part of size $n$ has degree $m$.\n\nFor $K_{3,5}$, each vertex in the $m=3$ part has degree $5$, and each vertex in the $n=5$ part has degree $3$. Both $5$ and $3$ are odd, so all $3+5=8$ vertices have odd degree.\n\nAdding one edge between two vertices increases the degree of each endpoint by $1$, thereby toggling the parity (odd to even or even to odd) of exactly two vertices. Loops are not permitted by the problem statement, so every added edge affects exactly two distinct vertices.\n\nLet $k$ be the number of added edges. Each added edge can convert at most two odd-degree vertices to even degree. To reduce the number of odd-degree vertices from $8$ to $0$, we must have\n$$\n2k \\geq 8 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad k \\geq 4.\n$$\nThus at least $4$ edges are necessary.\n\nTo see that $4$ edges suffice, pair up the $8$ odd-degree vertices into $4$ disjoint pairs and add one edge for each pair. This is allowed either by creating new direct pathways between the paired vertices (even within the same part) or by duplicating existing pathways; in either case, each endpoint’s degree increases by $1$, making all degrees even.
