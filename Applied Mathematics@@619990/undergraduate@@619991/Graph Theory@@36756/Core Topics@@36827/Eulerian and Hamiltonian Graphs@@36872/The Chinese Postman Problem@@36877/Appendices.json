The additional traversals beyond one per edge form a multiset of edges whose endpoints are the odd-degree vertices of the original graph; decomposing these added traversals into paths pairs up the odd vertices, and the total added cost is at least the sum of the distances of some perfect matching on the odd set. Hence no feasible solution can have total cost less than $S$ plus the minimum matching cost $6$.
