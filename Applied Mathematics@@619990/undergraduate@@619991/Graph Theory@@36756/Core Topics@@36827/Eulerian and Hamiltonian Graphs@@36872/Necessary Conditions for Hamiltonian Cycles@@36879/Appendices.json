A necessary condition for the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle in any graph is that every vertex has degree at least $2$. The reason is that in a cycle, each vertex must have two distinct incident edges used by the cycle—one to enter and one to exit—so each vertex must have at least two incident edges available in the graph.\n\nFormally: if a graph $G$ has a Hamiltonian cycle $C$, then for every vertex $v \\in V(G)$ the degree $\\deg_{G}(v)$ satisfies $\\deg_{G}(v) \\ge 2$, because $C$ uses exactly two distinct edges at $v$.\n\nIn $K_{1,N}$, each satellite vertex has $\\deg = 1$.

A graph with structural \"choke points,\" known as cut-vertices, can often be non-Hamiltonian because a single cycle cannot navigate such a fragile connection and still visit every vertex.

A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle within the graph that visits every vertex exactly once. A graph that contains such a cycle is called a Hamiltonian graph.\n\nCertain structural properties can guarantee that a graph is *not* Hamiltonian. One such property is described as follows:\n*There exist two non-adjacent vertices, let's call them $u$ and $v$, for which there is exactly one common neighbor, let's call it $w$. Furthermore, this common neighbor $w$ is a cut-vertex whose removal disconnects the graph into multiple components, with $u$ and $v$ located in different components.*\n\nYou are given four different graph structures. Your task is to identify which of these graphs exhibits this specific non-Hamiltonian property.\n\nFor clarity, a **neighbor** of a vertex is any vertex connected to it by an edge. A **cut-vertex** is a vertex whose removal (along with all edges incident to it) increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nWhich of the following graphs has the specific property described above?\n\nA. A graph formed by taking two separate triangles, one with vertices $\\{A, B, C\\}$ and the other with vertices $\\{D, E, F\\}$, and then merging them by identifying vertex $C$ from the first triangle with vertex $D$ from the second. The resulting single vertex is labeled $W$. The original vertices $A$ and $E$ are relabeled as $U$ and $V$, respectively.\n\nB.

The wheel graph $W_7$, which is formed by taking a 6-vertex cycle (labeled $C_1$ to $C_6$) and adding a central \"hub\" vertex $H$ that is connected by an edge to every vertex on the cycle.\n\nD. A graph with five vertices $\\{P, Q, R, S, T\\}$ and edges that form a \"house\" shape: a square base with vertices $(P, Q, R, S)$ in order, and a triangular roof formed by connecting vertex $T$ to the top two vertices of the square, $P$ and $Q$.", "solution": "We must find a graph in which there exist two non-adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$ that have exactly one common neighbor $w$, and such that $w$ is a cut-vertex whose removal disconnects the graph into at least two components with $u$ and $v$ lying in different components.\n\nConsider option A. The graph consists of two triangles identified at a single vertex $W$: one triangle on vertices $\\{U,B,W\\}$ and the other on $\\{V,F,W\\}$. Take $u=U$, $v=V$, and $w=W$. The neighbors are $N(U)=\\{B,W\\}$ and $N(V)=\\{F,W\\}$, hence $N(U)\\cap N(V)=\\{W\\}$, so $U$ and $V$ have exactly one common neighbor, namely $W$. Moreover, removing $W$ deletes all edges incident to $W$ and separates the graph into two components: one containing $\\{U,B\\}$ and the other containing $\\{V,F\\}$. Therefore $W$ is a cut-vertex, and $U$ and $V$ lie in different components of $G-\\{W\\}$. Thus A satisfies the stated property.\n\nConsider option B. Start from the cycle on eight vertices, which is $2$-vertex-connected. Adding the chords $(A,C)$ and $(A,E)$ cannot create a cut-vertex because adding edges cannot reduce vertex-connectivity. Therefore this graph has no cut-vertex and cannot satisfy the property.\n\nConsider option C. The wheel graph on six rim vertices plus a hub has no cut-vertex: removing the hub leaves the rim cycle connected, and removing any rim vertex leaves the hub connected to all remaining rim vertices, maintaining connectivity. Hence no vertex is a cut-vertex, so the property fails.\n\nConsider option D. The “house” graph on vertices $\\{P,Q,R,S,T\\}$ with edges forming a square $P\\!-\\!Q\\!-\\!R\\!-\\!S\\!-\\!P$ and roof edges $T\\!-\\!P$ and $T\\!-\\!Q$ has no cut-vertex. Indeed, removing $T$ leaves the square connected; removing $P$ leaves $Q\\!-\\!R\\!-\\!S$ with $T\\!-\\!Q$ still connected; removing $Q$ leaves $P\\!-\\!S\\!-\\!R$ with $T\\!-\\!P$ still connected; removing $R$ leaves $P\\!-\\!Q\\!-\\!S$ with $T$ attached to $P$ and $Q$; removing $S$ leaves $P\\!-\\!Q\\!-\\!R$ with $T$ attached to $P$ and $Q$.

The drone operational area contains two types of locations: Warehouses (Set $W$) and Distribution Hubs (Set $H$). The company aims to create a single, closed-loop tour where a drone starts at a location, visits every single warehouse and every single distribution hub exactly once, and then returns to its starting point. A critical operational constraint is that the drone's flight path must strictly alternate between a warehouse and a distribution hub.\n\nThe campus contains 8 warehouses, so $W = \\{W_1, W_2, \\dots, W_8\\}$, and 8 distribution hubs, so $H = \\{H_1, H_2, \\dots, H_8\\}$.\n\nThe specific flight permissions, which are bidirectional, are defined as follows:\n1.

The desired tour is possible.\n\nB. The desired tour is not possible because the number of warehouses is not equal to the number of distribution hubs.\n\nC. The desired tour is not possible because the flight restrictions on Group Alpha warehouses create a structural bottleneck.\n\nD. The desired tour is not possible because the network of locations and flight paths is disconnected.", "solution": "Model the operational area as a bipartite graph $G=(W \\cup H, E)$ with partitions $W=\\{W_{1},\\dots,W_{8}\\}$ and $H=\\{H_{1},\\dots,H_{8}\\}$.

A fundamental necessary condition for the existence of such a cycle is the existence of a perfect matching. In a bipartite graph with equal partition sizes, any Hamiltonian cycle of length $2n$ alternates between the two parts and selecting every other edge of the cycle yields a perfect matching saturating $W$ (and also one saturating $H$). Therefore, the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle implies the existence of a perfect matching.\n\nTo test for a perfect matching from $W$ to $H$, apply Hall’s theorem: a bipartite graph $G=(W \\cup H,E)$ has a perfect matching saturating $W$ if and only if for every subset $X \\subseteq W$, one has $|N(X)| \\ge |X|$. Take $X=S_{A}$. Then $N(X)=H_{A}$, hence $|N(X)|=3$ while $|X|=4$, so $|N(X)||X|$. This violates Hall’s condition. Therefore, no perfect matching exists, and consequently no Hamiltonian cycle can exist.\n\nThus the tour is not possible, and the reason is the bottleneck created by the restriction that four warehouses in $S_{A}$ can connect to only three hubs in $H_{A}$.
