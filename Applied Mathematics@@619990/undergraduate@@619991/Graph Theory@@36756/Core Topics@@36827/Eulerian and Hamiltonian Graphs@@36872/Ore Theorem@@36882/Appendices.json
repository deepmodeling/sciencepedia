The network topology is represented by a simple graph where servers are vertices and direct communication links are edges. For robustness and balanced traffic, the network is required to be an $r$-regular graph, meaning every server is connected to exactly $r$ other servers.\n\nA crucial property for certain routing algorithms is the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle. A well-known sufficient condition for a graph to be Hamiltonian is **Ore's condition**. A graph on $n \\ge 3$ vertices satisfies Ore's condition if for every pair of non-adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$, the sum of their degrees is at least $n$. Formally, for all pairs of vertices $(u,v)$ such that there is no edge between them, it must hold that $\\deg(u) + \\deg(v) \\ge n$.\n\nConsider a network design with $n=12$ servers.

For any non-adjacent pair, the sum is $2r \\le 10  12$, violating Ore's condition. Hence no $r \\le 5$ can guarantee the condition. For $r=6$, any non-adjacent pair satisfies $2r = 12 = n$, so Ore's condition holds for all non-adjacent pairs. Moreover, an $r$-regular simple graph on $n=12$ vertices exists for $r=6$ because $0 \\le r \\le n-1$ and $nr$ is even, which is satisfied by $r=6$.\nTherefore, the minimum integer $r$ that guarantees Ore's condition for all $r$-regular graphs on $12$ vertices is $6$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "1525231"}, {"introduction": "Ore's theorem provides a sufficient condition for a graph to be Hamiltonian, but what happens when the condition is not met? This practice [@problem_id:1525206] asks you to analyze a specific graph built by joining two complete subgraphs with a single \"bridge\" edge. By calculating vertex degrees and checking the Ore condition for non-adjacent pairs, you will see first-hand how its failure relates to other structural properties that can prevent a Hamiltonian cycle.", "problem": "Consider a simple graph $G$ constructed as follows. We begin with two disjoint complete graphs, which we will call $K_A$ and $K_B$. Each of these complete graphs has 5 vertices. Let the vertex set of $K_A$ be $V_A = \\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5\\}$ and the vertex set of $K_B$ be $V_B = \\{b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, b_5\\}$. The graph $G$ is formed by the union of $K_A$ and $K_B$, with the addition of a single edge connecting vertex $a_5$ to vertex $b_5$. This new edge is a bridge in $G$.

Graph $G$ possesses a bridge, which implies it cannot be Hamiltonian.", "solution": "We first determine the total number of vertices. Each of $K_{A}$ and $K_{B}$ has $5$ vertices, and the union with a single additional edge does not change the vertex count. Hence\n$$\nn=|V_{A}|+|V_{B}|=5+5=10.\n$$\n\nNext, we compute vertex degrees. In $K_{A}$, each vertex is adjacent to the other $4$ vertices of $K_{A}$. The only cross-edge is the bridge $a_{5}b_{5}$.

A Hamiltonian cycle must be a single cycle including all vertices. A bridge cannot lie on any cycle. Since the only connection between $V_{A}$ and $V_{B}$ is the bridge $a_{5}b_{5}$, any cycle that visits vertices in both parts would have to use $a_{5}b_{5}$, which is impossible for a cycle because a bridge cannot be part of a cycle.
