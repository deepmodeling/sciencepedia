The design is modeled as a simple, undirected graph where data centers are vertices and direct communication links are edges. The proposed network has 7 vertices, and the list of degrees for these vertices is given as $(3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6)$.\n\nThe analyst's goal is to determine if this network structure guarantees the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle—a closed loop that visits every vertex exactly once. The analyst recalls Dirac's theorem, which states that for a simple graph with $n$ vertices where $n \\ge 3$, if the minimum degree $\\delta(G)$ of the graph satisfies the condition $\\delta(G) \\ge \\frac{n}{2}$, then the graph is Hamiltonian.\n\nAfter examining the degree sequence, the analyst considers several lines of reasoning. Which of the following statements represents the most fundamental and logically sound conclusion regarding the proposed network design?\n\nA. The analyst can conclude the graph is not Hamiltonian. According to Dirac's theorem's condition, the minimum degree must be at least $\\frac{7}{2} = 3.5$. Since the actual minimum degree is 3, the condition is not met, which proves the absence of a Hamiltonian cycle.\n\nB. The analyst cannot draw any conclusion from Dirac's theorem.

The graph might be Hamiltonian, or it might not be; further investigation using other methods is required.\n\nC. The analyst should conclude that the proposed network design is physically impossible. There is a fundamental contradiction in the description of the graph itself, which invalidates any further analysis regarding its properties, including Hamiltonicity.\n\nD. The analyst can conclude the graph is Hamiltonian. Although the minimum degree is only 3, the average degree of the graph is $\\frac{3+4+4+4+5+5+6}{7} \\approx 4.43$, which is well above the threshold of $3.5$. This high average connectivity is sufficient to ensure a Hamiltonian cycle.", "solution": "We model the proposed network as a simple undirected graph $G$ with $n=7$ vertices and degree sequence $(3,4,4,4,5,5,6)$. By the Handshaking Lemma, for any simple undirected graph with vertex degrees $d_{1},\\dots,d_{n}$, the sum of degrees equals twice the number of edges:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_{i} = 2|E|.\n$$\nTherefore $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_{i}$ must be an even integer.

The analyst is correct. Since $n = 2k+1$, the condition for Dirac's theorem is $\\delta(G) \\ge n/2 = k+0.5$. As the degree must be an integer, this is equivalent to $\\delta(G) \\ge k$, which the design rule guarantees.\n\nB. The analyst is correct.
