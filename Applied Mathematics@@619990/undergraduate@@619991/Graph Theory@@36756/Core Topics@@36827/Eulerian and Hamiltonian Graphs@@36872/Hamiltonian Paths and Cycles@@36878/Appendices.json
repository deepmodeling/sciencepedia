Therefore every vertex has degree $2$, so $\\delta(G_{A})=2$. A cycle $C_{n}$ with $n \\geq 3$ has no cut-vertex, hence is $2$-connected. However, $G_{A}$ itself is a Hamiltonian cycle, so it is Hamiltonian. Thus $G_{A}$ fails condition (iii).\n\nFor B: $G_{B}$ has edges forming two $4$-cycles $c\\!-\\!a_{1}\\!-\\!a_{2}\\!-\\!a_{3}\\!-\\!c$ and $c\\!-\\!b_{1}\\!-\\!b_{2}\\!-\\!b_{3}\\!-\\!c$ sharing only the vertex $c$.

The remaining vertex $y_{5}$ is adjacent to two distinct vertices $x_{3}$ and $x_{4}$ in $H$. If one adds a new vertex adjacent to at least two vertices of a $2$-connected graph, the resulting graph remains $2$-connected. A direct verification: let $G'=H \\cup \\{y_{5}\\}$ with edges $(y_{5},x_{3})$ and $(y_{5},x_{4})$. For any single vertex removal $z$, if $z=y_{5}$ then the remainder is $H$, which is connected; if $z \\in V(H)$, then $H-z$ is connected, and $y_{5}$ remains adjacent to at least one of $x_{3},x_{4}$ (since $z$ can remove at most one of them), hence $y_{5}$ has a path into $H-z$, and all vertices remain in a single component. Therefore $G_{C}$ is $2$-connected.\n\nTo show $G_{C}$ is not Hamiltonian, note that $G_{C}$ is bipartite with parts of sizes $|X|=4$ and $|Y|=5$. Any cycle in a bipartite graph alternates between the two parts and hence has even length. A Hamiltonian cycle would have length $|V(G_{C})|=9$, which is odd, a contradiction.

A crucial characteristic for potential applications in molecular computing is the existence of a \"visiting tour,\" a path that traverses the bonds to visit every atom exactly once before returning to the starting atom.\n\nIn graph-theoretic terms, this corresponds to the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle. The molecular graph has the following properties: it is planar, 3-vertex-connected, and every vertex has a degree of 3. An analysis of its structure reveals that its surface is composed entirely of faces of two sizes: there are exactly 13 pentagonal (5-sided) faces and 1 heptagonal (7-sided) face.\n\nTo determine if a Hamiltonian cycle exists, one can use Grinberg's theorem, which provides a necessary condition.
