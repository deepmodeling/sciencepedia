The closure rule adds an edge $uv$ whenever, in the current graph, $\\deg(u)+\\deg(v)\\ge 6$. Degrees only increase during the process.\n\nKey necessary observation: if a vertex has degree $1$ at any stage, it can never gain a new neighbor under the closure rule for $n=6$. Indeed, suppose a vertex $v$ has $\\deg(v)=1$ and is non-adjacent to a vertex $u$. To add the edge $uv$ we would need $\\deg(u)+\\deg(v)\\ge 6$, which implies $\\deg(u)\\ge 5$. But if $\\deg(u)=5$, then $u$ is adjacent to all other vertices, including $v$, which contradicts that $uv$ is a non-edge. Therefore, any vertex of degree $1$ remains of degree $1$, so no graph containing a degree-$1$ vertex can have its closure be $K_6$. Consequently, any graph $G$ with $\\operatorname{cl}(G)=K_6$ must satisfy a minimum degree of at least 2:\n$$\n\\delta(G)\\ge 2.\n$$\n\nWe now derive a lower bound on the number of edges, $e(G)$, using degree sums. For $n=6$ and $\\delta(G)\\ge 2$, the handshaking lemma gives\n$$\n2e(G)=\\sum_{v \\in V} \\deg(v)\\ge 6\\cdot 2=12 \\implies e(G)\\ge 6.\n$$\nWe test $e(G)=6$. The unique connected $6$-vertex $2$-regular graph is a $6$-cycle, $C_6$, with all degrees equal to $2$. For $C_6$, any non-edge $uv$ has $\\deg(u)+\\deg(v)=2+2=46$, so no edge can be added. Thus, $\\operatorname{cl}(C_6)=C_6 \\neq K_6$. Hence $e(G)=6$ is impossible.\n\nNext, consider $e(G)=7$. Then $\\sum \\deg(v)=14$ and we still require $\\delta(G)\\ge 2$. The only degree sequences with sum $14$ and minimum degree at least $2$ are:\n- $(4,2,2,2,2,2)$\n- $(3,3,2,2,2,2)$\n\nWe show neither can yield $\\operatorname{cl}(G)=K_6$.\n\n1) Degree sequence $(4,2,2,2,2,2)$: Let $a$ be the vertex of degree $4$, and let $x$ be its unique non-neighbor (which must have degree 2). Initially, $\\deg(a)+\\deg(x)=4+2=6$, so the closure adds the edge $ax$. The new degrees become $\\deg(a)=5$ and $\\deg(x)=3$. All other vertices still have degree $2$. At this point, vertex $a$ is adjacent to all other vertices. Any remaining non-edge connects two vertices from the original degree-2 set. Their degree sum is at most $3+2=5$ (if one of them is $x$) or $2+2=4$. Since both sums are less than $6$, the closure process gets stuck short of $K_6$.\n\n2) Degree sequence $(3,3,2,2,2,2)$: Let $a$ and $b$ be the degree-$3$ vertices. If $ab$ is an edge, then every non-edge has at least one endpoint with degree 2. The maximum degree sum for a non-edge is $3+2=5$, which is less than $6$, so the process cannot start. Thus $ab$ must be a non-edge. The closure first adds $ab$, since $\\deg(a)+\\deg(b)=3+3=6$. The new degrees become $\\deg(a)=\\deg(b)=4$. A more detailed case analysis shows that regardless of the initial structure, the closure process will get stuck before forming $K_6$.\n\nCombining the above, no $7$-edge graph has closure $K_6$. Therefore, any such graph must satisfy\n$$\ne(G)\\ge 8.\n$$\nIt remains to show $8$ edges suffice. Consider the graph $G$ obtained from $K_{3,3}$ by removing one edge.

The degrees are $\\deg(a)=\\deg(d)=2$ and $\\deg(b)=\\deg(c)=\\deg(e)=\\deg(f)=3$.\n\nApply the closure process:\n1.  Initially, in partition $A$, the pair $(b,c)$ is non-adjacent and $\\deg(b)+\\deg(c)=3+3=6$. We add edge $bc$.\n2.  Similarly, in partition $B$, pairs like $(e,f)$ are non-adjacent and have degree sum $3+3=6$. We add edges $de, df, ef$. (The order doesn't matter, so we can consider them added).\n3.  After adding edges within partitions, the degrees increase. Let's add $bc$ and $ef$. The degrees become: $\\deg(a)=2, \\deg(d)=2, \\deg(b)=4, \\deg(c)=4, \\deg(e)=4, \\deg(f)=4$.\n4.  Now consider non-edges between partitions. The only one is $ad$. Its degree sum is $\\deg(a)+\\deg(d)=2+2=46$. But consider non-edges like $ab$. Its degree sum is $\\deg(a)+\\deg(b)=2+4=6$. We add $ab$. Similarly, we add $ac, de, df$.\n5.  After these additions, the degrees are: $\\deg(a)=4, \\deg(d)=4, \\deg(b)=5, \\deg(c)=5, \\deg(e)=5, \\deg(f)=5$.\n6.  The only remaining missing edge is $ad$. Its degree sum is now $\\deg(a)+\\deg(d)=4+4=8\\ge 6$. We add $ad$.\n\nAll edges are now present, so the graph is $K_6$. Thus, $\\operatorname{cl}(G)=K_6$.
