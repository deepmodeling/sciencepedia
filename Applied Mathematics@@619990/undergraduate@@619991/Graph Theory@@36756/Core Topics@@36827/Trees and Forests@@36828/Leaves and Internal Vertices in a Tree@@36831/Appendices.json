This exercise provides a direct application of these principles, allowing you to practice a core quantitative skill by relating the total number of vertices to the degrees of its distinct vertex types. Solving this problem [@problem_id:1518553] will strengthen your ability to use basic tree properties to uncover unknown structural parameters, a foundational task in network analysis.", "problem": "A certain network is modeled as a simple undirected graph that is a tree. This tree has a total of 20 vertices. Within this structure, there are two types of vertices: leaves, which are vertices of degree 1, and internal vertices. It is known that there are 14 leaves in this tree. Furthermore, all internal vertices are uniform in their connectivity, meaning they all have the same degree, which we will call $d$. Based on this information, determine the value of the degree $d$ for an internal vertex.", "solution": "A tree with $n$ vertices has $|E| = n - 1$ edges. By the handshaking lemma, the sum of degrees equals twice the number of edges:\n$$\n\\sum \\deg(v) = 2|E| = 2(n - 1).\n$$\nLet the number of leaves be $L$ and the number of internal vertices be $I$. Given $n = 20$ and $L = 14$, we have\n$$\nI = n - L = 20 - 14 = 6.\n$$\nAll internal vertices have the same degree $d$, while each leaf has degree $1$.

Let $v$ be a leaf of $T$, and let $u$ be the unique vertex adjacent to $v$. A new graph, $T'$, is formed by removing the vertex $v$ and the edge $(u,v)$.

This problem explores a subtle but critical distinction in the definition of a \"leaf\" between general unrooted trees and specialized rooted trees, which are ubiquitous in computer science. By carefully applying the given hierarchical definitions, you will see how a vertex's role can differ from what its degree alone might suggest, sharpening your attention to definitional detail [@problem_id:1518539].", "problem": "In graph theory, definitions are paramount, and their precise application is critical. Consider the following set of definitions pertaining to a rooted tree $T$:\n\n1.  A **rooted tree** is a tree in which one vertex has been designated as the **root**. The level of a vertex is the length of the simple path from the root to that vertex.\n2.  For any edge connecting vertices $u$ and $v$, if the level of $u$ is less than the level of $v$, then $u$ is the **parent** of $v$, and $v$ is a **child** of $u$.\n3.  A vertex is called a **leaf** if it has no children.\n4.  A vertex is called an **internal vertex** if it is not a leaf.\n\nNow, consider a special rooted tree $T$ constructed with a vertex set $V = \\{r\\} \\cup \\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n\\}$ where $n \\ge 2$. The vertex $r$ is designated as the root. The edges of the tree are such that $r$ is connected *only* to the vertex $v_1$.

The vertex $r$ is a leaf because its degree is 1.\n\nB. The vertex $r$ is an internal vertex because all roots are internal vertices.\n\nC. The vertex $r$ is an internal vertex because it has a child.\n\nD. The classification of vertex $r$ is ambiguous; it can be considered a leaf based on its degree and an internal vertex based on its role as a non-terminal node in the hierarchy.\n\nE. The vertex $r$ is neither a leaf nor an internal vertex, as it is a special case.", "solution": "We apply the provided definitions step by step to the specific rooted tree.\n\n1. By definition of level, the root has level $0$. Since $r$ is connected only to $v_{1}$, and the tree is rooted at $r$, it follows that $v_{1}$ lies at level $1$ (the simple path from $r$ to $v_{1}$ has length $1$).\n\n2. By the parent-child definition, for the edge $\\{r,v_{1}\\}$ with $\\text{level}(r)=0<1=\\text{level}(v_{1})$, the vertex $r$ is the parent of $v_{1}$ and $v_{1}$ is a child of $r$. Hence $r$ has at least one child.\n\n3. By the definition of a leaf (no children), since $r$ has a child, $r$ is not a leaf.\n\n4. By the definition of an internal vertex (not a leaf), since $r$ is not a leaf, $r$ is an internal vertex.\n\nNow evaluate the options against these conclusions and the given definitions:\n\n- Option A: Asserts $r$ is a leaf because its degree is $1$. However, a leaf is defined by having no children, not by degree. Since $r$ has a child, this is false.\n\n- Option B: Asserts $r$ is internal because all roots are internal. The classification of $r$ as internal is correct here, but the justification “all roots are internal” is not a consequence of the definitions (a single-vertex rooted tree has a root that is a leaf). Thus, this statement is not correct based strictly on the definitions as its reasoning is invalid.\n\n- Option C: Asserts $r$ is internal because it has a child. This directly matches steps 2–4 and is correct.\n\n- Option D: Claims ambiguity. The definitions yield an unambiguous classification: $r$ is internal. Hence false.\n\n- Option E: Claims $r$ is neither leaf nor internal. This contradicts the definitions, hence false.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1518539"}]}
