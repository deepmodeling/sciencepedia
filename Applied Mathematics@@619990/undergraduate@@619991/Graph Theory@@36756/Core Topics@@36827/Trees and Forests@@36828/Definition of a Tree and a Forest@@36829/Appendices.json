The number of servers in these four trees are 5, 10, 15, and 20, respectively.\n\nThe administrator performs two sequential operations to modify the network:\n\n1.  First, an edge is added to connect two distinct, previously non-adjacent servers that both belong to the largest tree (the one with 20 servers).\n2.  Second, another edge is added to connect a server from the smallest tree (the one with 5 servers) to a server from the tree with 15 servers.\n\nAfter both of these operations are completed, what is the final number of cycles and the final number of connected components in the resulting graph?\n\nProvide your answer as a row matrix `[C, K]`, where `C` is the final number of cycles and `K` is the final number of connected components.", "solution": "Model the network as a simple undirected graph with total vertices $V$ and edges $E$, and let $K$ denote the number of connected components and $C$ the number of cycles (cyclomatic number).

On $4$ vertices, any vertex of degree $3$ is adjacent to all other three vertices. Hence if two vertices have degree $3$, then each of the remaining two vertices is adjacent to both of them and thus has degree at least $2$, contradicting the required degrees $(1,1)$. Therefore $(3,3,1,1)$ is not graphical on $4$ vertices.\n\n- If $k=5$, the remaining vertex forms a component of size $1$ and thus has degree $0$, contradicting the given degree sequence (all degrees are $1$ or $3$).\n\nThe only remaining possibility is $k=6$, i.e., $G$ is connected. Therefore any simple graph with this degree sequence must be connected, so D is false.\n\nTree property: Since $G$ is connected and has $m=5$ edges with $n=6$ vertices, we have $m=n-1$.
