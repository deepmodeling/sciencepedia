This hands-on problem challenges you to apply this fundamental principle, which states that a tree with $n$ vertices must have exactly $n-1$ edges.

Initially, the servers are organized into $k$ distinct, isolated local networks. Within each local network, the connections are configured such that the network forms a tree (i.e., it is connected and has no cycles).

The final unified network must also be free of any cyclical paths to ensure efficiency and prevent data packet loops.\n\nDetermine the exact number of new connections (edges) that must be added to achieve this goal.
