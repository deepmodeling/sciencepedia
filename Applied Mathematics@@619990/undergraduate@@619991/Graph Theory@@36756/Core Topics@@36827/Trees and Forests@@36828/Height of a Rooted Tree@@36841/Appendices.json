A path from a vertex $u$ to a vertex $v$ is a sequence of edges that allows one to travel from $u$ to $v$. The depth of a vertex in a rooted tree is the length (number of edges) of the unique path from the root to that vertex. The height of a rooted tree is defined as the maximum depth among all vertices in the tree. A vertex in a rooted tree is called a leaf if it has no outgoing edges (i.e., it has no children).\n\nConsider a rooted tree with exactly 10 vertices and a height of exactly 4. What is the maximum possible number of leaves that such a tree can have?", "solution": "Let $N$ be the total number of vertices, $I$ the number of internal vertices (vertices with out-degree at least $1$), and $L$ the number of leaves (vertices with out-degree $0$). In any rooted tree, every vertex is either internal or a leaf, so\n$$\nL = N - I.\n$$\nWe are given $N = 10$ and that the height is exactly $4$. Height $4$ means there exists a path of length $4$ from the root to some vertex. The vertices on this path at depths $0,1,2,3$ must each have at least one child (to continue the path), hence they are internal. Therefore,\n$$\nI \\geq 4.\n$$\nTo maximize $L$, we minimize $I$. The lower bound $I = 4$ is achievable: take a single path of length $4$ (depths $0$ through $4$), which uses $5$ vertices with exactly $4$ internal vertices (depths $0$ to $3$) and one leaf at depth $4$. The remaining $N - 5 = 5$ vertices can be attached as additional children to any of these already-internal vertices (for example, to the root), which does not create any new internal vertices and does not increase the height beyond $4$. Thus the minimum possible $I$ is $4$.\n\nHence the maximum number of leaves is\n$$\nL_{\\max} = N - I_{\\min} = 10 - 4 = 6.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "1511879"}, {"introduction": "While we often analyze a single, given rooted tree, many applications start with an unrooted graph that can be rooted in multiple ways. This exercise explores how the choice of a root can dramatically impact the tree's height, a key structural parameter.
