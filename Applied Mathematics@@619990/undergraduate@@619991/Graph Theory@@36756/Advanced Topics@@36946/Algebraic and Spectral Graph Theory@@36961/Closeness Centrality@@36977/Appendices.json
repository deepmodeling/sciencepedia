In this system, a single main server acts as a hub, and it is directly connected to $k$ satellite receivers. Each receiver is connected *only* to the main server, and there are no direct connections between any two receivers. This network structure forms a 'star graph', which we will denote as $S_k$. The graph has a total of $k+1$ vertices (one central server and $k$ receivers), where $k$ is a positive integer.\n\nThe efficiency of a vertex in broadcasting information can be measured by its closeness centrality.

It is tempting to assume that the node with the most connections (highest degree) is also the most central, but is this always the case? This problem requires you to analyze several network structures to find one where the most connected node is not the one with the highest closeness centrality, highlighting the distinct insights these two important metrics offer about a node's role. [@problem_id:1495217]", "problem": "In network analysis, the importance of a node can be quantified using various centrality measures. For a simple, undirected, connected graph with $N$ vertices, two common measures are:\n\n1.  **Degree Centrality**: The degree centrality of a vertex $v$ is simply its degree, which is the number of edges connected to it. A vertex with more connections is considered more important by this measure.\n\n2.  **Closeness Centrality**: The closeness centrality of a vertex $v$ measures its average farness (inverse distance) to all other vertices. It is defined as $C(v) = \\frac{N-1}{\\sum_{u \\neq v} d(u,v)}$, where $d(u,v)$ is the length of the shortest path between vertices $u$ and $v$. A vertex with a higher closeness centrality is more \"central\" in the sense that it can reach all other nodes in the network more quickly on average.\n\nWhile one might intuitively expect that the node with the most direct connections (highest degree) is also the most central (highest closeness), this is not always true.\n\nConsider the following descriptions of four different communication networks. In which of these networks is it true that the vertex with the highest degree centrality is **not** the vertex with the highest closeness centrality?\n\nA. A corporate structure consists of two identical project teams, Team Alpha and Team Beta, each with 4 members. Within each team, every member can communicate directly with every other member of their own team. To connect the teams, one specific member from Team Alpha is connected to a liaison officer, \"L1\". L1 is connected to a second liaison officer, \"L2\", who is in turn connected to a specific member of Team Beta. The liaison officers are not members of either team and only make the connections described. The total network has 10 vertices (8 team members + 2 liaisons).\n\nB. A clandestine cell of 7 agents operates in a \"wheel\" formation. One agent, the \"hub\", can communicate directly with all 6 other \"field\" agents. The field agents are arranged in a ring, where each can communicate with their two immediate neighbors, in addition to the central hub.\n\nC. A supply chain consists of 7 depots arranged in a single line. Each depot can only receive supplies from and send supplies to its immediate neighbor(s) in the line. For example, the third depot is connected only to the second and fourth depots. The depots at the ends of the line are connected to only one other depot each.\n\nD. The command structure for a small fleet of 8 vessels is organized as a \"star\". One flagship command vessel is in direct communication with each of the other 7 support vessels. The support vessels do not communicate directly with each other.", "solution": "We compare degree centrality (maximum degree) and closeness centrality, where for a graph with $N$ vertices the closeness of $v$ is\n$$\nC(v)=\\frac{N-1}{\\sum_{u\\neq v} d(u,v)}=\\frac{N-1}{S(v)}.\n$$\nSince $N$ is fixed within each network, the vertex with highest closeness centrality is the one with smallest $S(v)$.\n\nCase A (two $K_{4}$ cliques linked by a path of two liaison nodes): Label the Alpha clique nodes as $a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}$ with $a_{0}$ connected to $L1$, and the Beta clique nodes as $b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},b_{3}$ with $b_{0}$ connected to $L2$, and $L1$ connected to $L2$. Degrees: $\\deg(a_{0})=\\deg(b_{0})=4$, $\\deg(a_{i})=\\deg(b_{j})=3$ for $i,j\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$, and $\\deg(L1)=\\deg(L2)=2$. Thus the maximum degree is $4$, attained by $a_{0}$ and $b_{0}$.\n\nCompute $S(v)$ by type:\n- For $a_{0}$,\n$$\nS(a_{0})=3\\cdot 1+1+2+3+3\\cdot 4=21.\n$$\n- For a non-bridge Alpha node $a_{1}$,\n$$\nS(a_{1})=3+2+3+4+3\\cdot 5=27.\n$$\n- For $L1$,\n$$\nS(L1)=1+3\\cdot 2+1+2+3\\cdot 3=19.\n$$\nBy symmetry, $S(b_{0})=21$, $S(b_{1})=27$, and $S(L2)=19$. The minimum $S(v)$ is $19$, achieved by $L1$ and $L2$, so the highest closeness is at the liaisons, not at $a_{0}$ or $b_{0}$. Therefore, in A the vertex (indeed, the vertices) with highest degree centrality are not those with highest closeness centrality.\n\nCase B (wheel on $7$ vertices): One hub $h$ connected to all $6$ rim nodes, and rim nodes form a cycle. Degrees: $\\deg(h)=6$ (maximum), rim degrees $=3$. Distances: for $h$, $S(h)=6\\cdot 1=6$. For a rim node $r$, distances are $1$ to $h$, $1$ to two adjacent rim nodes, and $2$ to the remaining three rim nodes, giving\n$$\nS(r)=1+2+3\\cdot 2=9.\n$$\nThus $S(h)<S(r)$, so the hub has the highest closeness and also the highest degree. Degree and closeness maxima coincide; the condition in the question is not satisfied.\n\nCase C (path on $7$ vertices): Endpoints have degree $1$; interior vertices have degree $2$, so the maximum degree is $2$ at vertices $2,3,4,5,6$. The unique minimum of $S(v)$ is at the central vertex (vertex $4$), for which\n$$\nS(4)=3+2+1+1+2+3=12,\n$$\nwhile an adjacent interior vertex (e.g., $3$) has\n$$\nS(3)=2+1+1+2+3+4=13.\n$$\nThus the maximum closeness is at the center (vertex $4$), which also has the maximum degree $2$. Since at least one vertex simultaneously achieves both maxima, the statement that the vertex with highest degree is not the one with highest closeness is not true here.\n\nCase D (star on $8$ vertices): Center $c$ has degree $7$ (maximum), leaves have degree $1$. Distances: $S(c)=7\\cdot 1=7$, and for a leaf $\\ell$, $S(\\ell)=1+6\\cdot 2=13$. Hence the center uniquely maximizes closeness and degree. The maxima coincide; the condition is not satisfied.\n\nConclusion: Only in network A do the vertices with highest degree centrality fail to be the vertices with highest closeness centrality.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1495217"}]}
