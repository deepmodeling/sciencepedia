This exercise provides a foundational understanding of how to quantify a node's immediate influence by simply counting its direct connections. We will analyze a hypothetical 'hub-and-spoke' network to calculate a node's normalized degree centrality, a crucial step for comparing importance across networks of different sizes.

In this network, the central server is connected by a direct communication link to every one of the $n$ client machines. Furthermore, the client machines are interconnected to form a ring topology: each client machine is connected to exactly two other client machines, forming a single closed loop of all $n$ clients. This network structure is an example of a wheel graph, denoted $W_{n+1}$.\n\nIn the analysis of such networks, two common centrality measures are defined as follows:\n1.  The **degree centrality** of a node (a server or a client) is the number of direct communication links connected to it.\n2.  The **normalized degree centrality** of a node is its degree centrality divided by the maximum possible degree in the network, which is equivalent to the total number of nodes in the network minus one.\n\nDetermine the normalized degree centrality for any one of the peripheral client machines.

This practice moves beyond immediate neighbors to consider the sum of shortest path distances, providing a measure of how quickly information can spread from a given point. By working with a symmetric ring network, we can calculate this value and gain a deeper appreciation for a node's overall 'farness' from the rest of the graph.
