Substituting into $\\lambda z = y + w$ gives $z = \\frac{y}{\\lambda - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}}$. The graph strictly contains the triangle graph $K_3$ as a proper subgraph, and by Perron–Frobenius monotonicity, its spectral radius $\\lambda$ strictly exceeds that of $K_3$, which is $2$. Hence $\\lambda > 2$, so $y = (\\lambda - 1) x > x$. Moreover, $z = \\frac{y}{\\lambda - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}} < y$ and $w = \\frac{z}{\\lambda} < z$. Thus $v_3$ is the unique vertex with maximal eigenvector centrality and is also the unique vertex with maximal degree.
