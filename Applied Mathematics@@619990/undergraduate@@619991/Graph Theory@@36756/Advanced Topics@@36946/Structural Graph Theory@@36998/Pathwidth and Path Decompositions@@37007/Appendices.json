It has practical applications in problems like circuit design and data routing. This problem asks you to determine the pathwidth of a specific type of network graph.\n\nFirst, let's establish the necessary definitions:\nA **path decomposition** of a graph $G=(V, E)$ is a sequence of subsets of vertices $X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_t$, called \"bags,\" that satisfy the following three properties:\n1.  The union of all bags covers all vertices of the graph: $\\bigcup_{i=1}^{t} X_i = V$.\n2.  For every edge $(u,v) \\in E$, there exists at least one bag $X_i$ that contains both $u$ and $v$.\n3.

The **pathwidth** of a graph $G$, denoted $\\text{pw}(G)$, is the minimum width over all possible path decompositions of $G$.\n\nConsider a graph, which we'll call $S_{n,k}$, constructed as follows. Start with a **star graph** $K_{1,n}$, which has a central vertex $c$ connected to $n$ distinct \"leaf\" vertices $\\{l_1, l_2, \\ldots, l_n\\}$. Then, modify this graph by adding all possible edges between the vertices in a chosen subset of $k$ leaves, $\\{l_1, l_2, \\ldots, l_k\\}$, thereby making this subset a **complete graph** $K_k$.

For any graph $G$, the pathwidth satisfies $\\text{pw}(G)\\geq \\omega(G)-1$, where $\\omega(G)$ is the size of a largest clique in $G$.

The set $\\{c\\}\\cup Q$ induces a clique of size $k+1$, since $Q$ is a clique and $c$ is adjacent to every leaf in $Q$.
