To avoid interference, any two drones that are within direct communication range of each other must be assigned different channels. The system is designed such that interference only occurs between specific pairs. The connections are as follows: $D_1$ is in range of $D_2$ and $D_5$; $D_2$ is in range of $D_1$ and $D_3$; $D_3$ is in range of $D_2$ and $D_4$; $D_4$ is in range of $D_3$ and $D_5$; and $D_5$ is in range of $D_4$ and $D_1$.\n\nFor a communication network to be considered \"frequency-optimal\", it must satisfy a special property: for any selected subset of drones from the fleet, the minimum number of frequency channels required for that subset to communicate without interference must be equal to the maximum number of drones in that subset that are all mutually in range of one another.\n\nLet the entire five-drone network be represented by a graph $G$.
