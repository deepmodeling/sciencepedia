The treewidth of a complete graph $K_k$ is $k-1$. If we can show that $W_n$ (for $n \\ge 4$) has a $K_4$ minor, this implies $tw(W_n) \\ge tw(K_4) = 4-1 = 3$.\n\nTo find a $K_4$ minor in $W_n$, we need to find four disjoint non-empty subsets of vertices $V_1, V_2, V_3, V_4$ such that the subgraphs induced by each $V_i$ are connected, and for every pair $i \\ne j$, there is an edge in $W_n$ connecting a vertex in $V_i$ to a vertex in $V_j$.\n\nLet's define these sets for $W_n$ with vertices $\\{c, v_1, \\dots, v_{n-1}\\}$ where $n \\ge 4$:\n- $V_1 = \\{c\\}$\n- $V_2 = \\{v_1\\}$\n- $V_3 = \\{v_2\\}$\n- $V_4 = \\{v_3, v_4, \\ldots, v_{n-1}\\}$\n\nLet's check the conditions:\n- The sets are disjoint and their union is a subset of $V(W_n)$.

For $V_4$, the vertices $\\{v_3, \\dots, v_{n-1}\\}$ form a path on the rim of the wheel graph (e.g., $v_3-v_4-\\dots-v_{n-1}$), which is connected. This holds as long as $V_4$ is not empty, which is true for $n \\ge 4$.\n- The sets are mutually adjacent:\n    - $(V_1, V_2)$: The edge $(c, v_1)$ connects them.\n    - $(V_1, V_3)$: The edge $(c, v_2)$ connects them.\n    - $(V_1, V_4)$: The edge $(c, v_3)$ connects them (since $v_3 \\in V_4$).\n    - $(V_2, V_3)$: The rim edge $(v_1, v_2)$ connects them.\n    - $(V_2, V_4)$: The rim edge $(v_1, v_{n-1})$ connects them (since $v_{n-1} \\in V_4$).\n    - $(V_3, V_4)$: The rim edge $(v_2, v_3)$ connects them (since $v_3 \\in V_4$).\n\nSince all conditions are met, $W_n$ has a $K_4$ minor for all $n \\ge 4$. This establishes the lower bound: $tw(W_n) \\ge 3$. This applies to the case $n \\ge 5$.\n\n**2. Upper Bound for $n \\ge 4$**\n\nTo establish an upper bound, we must construct a tree decomposition of width 3. A width of 3 means the largest bag must have size $3+1 = 4$.\n\nLet the tree $T$ be a path with $n-3$ vertices, which we label $t_1, t_2, \\ldots, t_{n-3}$. The edges of $T$ are $(t_i, t_{i+1})$ for $i=1, \\ldots, n-4$.

Since $c$ is in all bags, the edge $(c, v_j)$ is covered.\n    - Rim edges $(v_j, v_{j+1})$ for $j=1, \\ldots, n-2$:\n        - $(v_1, v_2)$: Covered by $X_{t_1} = \\{c, v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$.\n        - For $j \\in \\{2, \\ldots, n-3\\}$, the edge $(v_j, v_{j+1})$ is covered by bag $X_{t_{j-1}} = \\{c, v_1, v_j, v_{j+1}\\}$.\n        - $(v_{n-2}, v_{n-1})$: Covered by $X_{t_{n-3}} = \\{c, v_1, v_{n-2}, v_{n-1}\\}$.\n    - Rim wrap-around edge $(v_{n-1}, v_1)$: Covered by bag $X_{t_{n-3}} = \\{c, v_1, v_{n-2}, v_{n-1}\\}$.\n    All edges are covered.\n\n- **Property 3 (Connected Subtree):**\n    - For $c$ and $v_1$, the bags containing them correspond to all nodes of the path $T$, which is a connected subtree.\n    - For $v_2$, it is only in $X_{t_1}$. The induced subtree is the single node $t_1$, which is connected.\n    - For $v_j$ where $3 \\le j \\le n-2$, it is in bags $X_{t_{j-2}}$ and $X_{t_{j-1}}$. The nodes $t_{j-2}$ and $t_{j-1}$ are adjacent in the path $T$, so this forms a connected subtree.\n    - For $v_{n-1}$, it is only in $X_{t_{n-3}}$. The induced subtree is the single node $t_{n-3}$, which is connected.\n    The property holds for all vertices.\n\nThe largest bag in this decomposition has size 4 (e.g., $X_{t_1}$). Therefore, the width of this decomposition is $4-1=3$. This shows that $tw(W_n) \\le 3$.\n\n**Conclusion on Treewidth**\n\nSince we have shown $tw(W_n) \\ge 3$ and $tw(W_n) \\le 3$ for all $n \\ge 4$, we can conclude that $tw(W_n) = 3$ for $n \\ge 4$. This is true for the condition of the problem, $n \\ge 5$.\n\n**Analysis of the Options**\n\nNow we evaluate each statement for $n \\ge 5$:\n\nA. $tw(W_n) = 2$, and an optimal tree decomposition can be constructed using bags of size 3 arranged in a cycle.\nThis is false. We've shown $tw(W_n) = 3$. Also, the underlying structure of a tree decomposition must be a tree, not a cycle.\n\nB. $tw(W_n) = 3$, and any optimal tree decomposition must have an underlying tree $T$ that is a path.\nThe first part, $tw(W_n)=3$, is correct. However, the claim that *any* optimal decomposition's tree must be a path is false. For example, take the path decomposition $(T, \\{X_t\\})$ we constructed. We can form a new tree $T'$ by adding a new leaf node $t'$ adjacent to $t_1 \\in V(T)$. We can define a new set of bags where the bag for $t'$ is a copy of the bag for $t_1$, i.e., $X'_{t'} = X_{t_1}$. This new decomposition is also of width 3, but its underlying tree $T'$ is not a path.\n\nC. $tw(W_n) = 3$, and an optimal tree decomposition can be constructed where the underlying tree $T$ is a path.\nThis is correct. We found $tw(W_n) = 3$, and our explicit construction provides an optimal tree decomposition (width 3) where the underlying tree is a path.\n\nD. $tw(W_n)$ is not constant for $n \\ge 5$; specifically, $tw(W_n) = \\lfloor \\frac{n-1}{2} \\rfloor$.\nThis is false. We proved that $tw(W_n) = 3$ for all $n \\ge 4$, so it is constant for $n \\ge 5$.\n\nE. $tw(W_n) = 4$, because $W_n$ contains a $K_4$ subgraph and the hub vertex adds one to the treewidth.\nThis is false. The treewidth is 3, not 4. The reasoning is also flawed. For $n \\ge 5$, $W_n$ does not contain a $K_4$ as a subgraph (it only has triangles). It has a $K_4$ *minor*, which gives a lower bound of 3, not 4. The effect of a hub vertex on treewidth is not a simple addition.\n\nTherefore, the only true statement is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1555572"}, {"introduction": "A deep understanding of a graph parameter like treewidth includes knowing how it behaves when the graph's structure is altered.

The largest bag will have a size of either the original maximum, $k+1$, or the size of our new bag, which is 3. The width of the new decomposition is thus $\\max(k, |X_{new}| - 1) = \\max(k, 2)$.\n\n- If $tw(G) = k \\ge 2$, the width of our new decomposition for $G'$ is $k$.\n- If $tw(G) = 1$ (i.e., $G$ is a forest), then subdividing an edge results in another forest, $G'$, so $tw(G') = 1$.
