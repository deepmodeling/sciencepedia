Consider a scenario with five research teams, conveniently labeled 1 through 5, working on a collaborative project. To manage access to a shared supercomputer, certain pairs of teams are designated as having a \"scheduling conflict,\" meaning they cannot be assigned the same time slot. The conflicts are as follows:\n\n- Team 1 conflicts with Team 2 and Team 5.\n- Team 2 conflicts with Team 3.\n- Team 3 conflicts with Team 4.\n- Team 4 conflicts with Team 5.\n\nLet's represent this conflict system as a graph $G$, where each team is a vertex and an edge connects two vertices if the corresponding teams have a scheduling conflict.\n\nThe **clique number** of a graph, denoted $\\omega(G)$, is the size of the largest subset of vertices in which every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. In our scenario, this corresponds to the maximum number of teams that are all mutually in conflict with each other.\n\nThe **chromatic number** of a graph, denoted $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

This hands-on exercise challenges you to see how adding a single edge—a chord—to a simple cycle can fundamentally alter its structure. By analyzing how a chord transforms a 7-cycle, you will discover how a smaller odd hole can be created, offering a concrete illustration of how a graph can fail to be a Berge graph [@problem_id:1482736].", "id": "1482736", "problem": "In graph theory, an induced cycle of length $k \\ge 4$ is called a hole. A hole is an odd hole if its length $k$ is an odd integer. Note that for a cycle to be induced, no two vertices of the cycle can be connected by an edge that is not itself an edge of the cycle. A graph is called a Berge graph if it does not contain an odd hole, and its complement graph also does not contain an odd hole.\n\nConsider a graph $G$ constructed as follows. Start with a simple cycle on 7 vertices, labeled sequentially as $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_7$. Then, introduce a single new edge, called a chord, that connects two vertices whose distance in the original cycle is 3. The distance between two vertices in a cycle is the length of the shortest path between them along the cycle edges.

This is an induced $4$-cycle (no extra edges among $\\{v_{1},v_{2},v_{3},v_{4}\\}$ besides the cycle edges), but it is even, so it is not an odd hole.\n- The path $v_{1}-v_{7}-v_{6}-v_{5}-v_{4}$ of length $4$ yields the cycle $v_{1}-v_{4}-v_{5}-v_{6}-v_{7}-v_{1}$ of length $5$. To check that it is induced, consider the vertex set $S=\\{v_{1},v_{4},v_{5},v_{6},v_{7}\\}$. The edges of $G$ with both ends in $S$ are exactly $(v_{1},v_{4})$, $(v_{4},v_{5})$, $(v_{5},v_{6})$, $(v_{6},v_{7})$, and $(v_{7},v_{1})$, which are precisely the consecutive edges of this $5$-cycle; there are no additional edges among nonconsecutive vertices in $S$ because the only edges of $G$ are the cycle edges of $C_{7}$ and the chord $(v_{1},v_{4})$. Hence this $5$-cycle is an induced cycle, i.e., an odd hole.\n\nSince holes have length at least $4$ and the smallest odd length at least $4$ is $5$, the existence of the induced $5$-cycle above shows that the shortest odd hole in $G$ has length $5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$"}, {"introduction": "The definition of a Berge graph is beautifully symmetric, forbidding both odd holes in a graph $G$ and odd holes in its complement $\\bar{G}$ (which are called odd antiholes in $G$).
