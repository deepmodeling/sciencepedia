The graph $K_{4}$ has $4$ vertices and $6$ edges. An ear decomposition partitions the edges into $P_{0}$ (a simple cycle) and subsequent ears $P_{i}$, $i \\geq 1$, where each $P_{i}$ is a simple path whose endpoints lie in $G_{i-1}$ and whose internal vertices do not. The sequence of ear lengths is $(l_{1},\\dots,l_{k})$ with $l_{i}$ equal to the number of edges in $P_{i}$, and $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} l_{i} = |E(K_{4})| - |E(P_{0})|$.\n\nFirst, $P_{0}$ must be a cycle in $K_{4}$. The only possible cycle lengths in $K_{4}$ are $3$ (a triangle) and $4$ (a $4$-cycle), since $K_{4}$ is complete on $4$ vertices.\n\nCase 1: $P_{0}$ is a triangle (length $3$). Then $G_{0}$ contains exactly $3$ vertices and $3$ edges; the fourth vertex is not in $G_{0}$. For the first ear $P_{1}$, both endpoints must lie in $G_{0}$ and all internal vertices must be outside $G_{0}$. The only vertex outside $G_{0}$ is the fourth vertex, so the only possible ear is a path of length $2$ between two triangle vertices whose unique internal vertex is the outside vertex. A length $1$ ear is impossible at this step because that would require both endpoints in $G_{0}$, but any unused length $1$ edge incident to the outside vertex would have one endpoint not in $G_{0}$. Thus $l_{1}=2$. After adding this ear, $5$ edges are present, and exactly one edge remains: the edge from the new vertex to the third triangle vertex. This edge can be added as a length $1$ ear because now both endpoints lie in the current subgraph and there are no internal vertices. Therefore the ear-length sequence is $(2,1)$, and no other sequence can arise from a triangular $P_{0}$.\n\nCase 2: $P_{0}$ is a $4$-cycle (length $4$). Then $G_{0}$ contains all $4$ vertices and $4$ edges; the remaining edges are the two diagonals. Any subsequent ear must have endpoints in $G_{0}$ and internal vertices outside $G_{0}$. Since there are no vertices outside $G_{0}$, no ear can have any internal vertex; hence every ear must be of length $1$. Exactly two edges remain, so the only possible ear-length sequence is $(1,1)$. A length $2$ ear is impossible here because that would require at least one internal vertex not in $G_{0}$, and none exist.\n\nThese two cases exhaust all possibilities, yielding exactly the sequences $(2,1)$ and $(1,1)$.
