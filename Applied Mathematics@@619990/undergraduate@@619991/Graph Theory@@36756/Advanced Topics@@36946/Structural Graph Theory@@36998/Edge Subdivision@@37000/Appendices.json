In graph theory, this modification is known as subdividing each edge of the graph exactly once.

The distance between any two vertices in a graph is defined as the number of edges in the shortest path connecting them.\n\nA new graph, $G'$, is formed by performing an operation known as edge subdivision on a single edge of $G$. The edge $(v_j, v_{j+1})$ is subdivided $k$ times. This operation involves removing the original edge $(v_j, v_{j+1})$ and introducing $k$ new, distinct vertices, say $w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_k$.

Let us consider the wheel graph $W_5$, which has 5 vertices in total. We can label the central vertex as $c$ and the vertices on the outer cycle $C_4$ as $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4$ in sequential order. The edges of $W_5$ can be categorized into two types: 'spoke' edges, which are of the form $\\{c, v_i\\}$, and 'rim' edges, which are of the form $\\{v_i, v_{i+1}\\}$ (where the index is taken modulo 4, so $v_5$ is identified with $v_1$).\n\nWe will create two new graphs by performing an 'edge subdivision'. To subdivide an edge $\\{u, v\\}$, we remove this edge and introduce a new vertex $w$, along with two new edges $\\{u, w\\}$ and $\\{w, v\\}$.\n\nLet $G_1$ be the graph obtained by subdividing the spoke edge $\\{c, v_1\\}$.\nLet $G_2$ be the graph obtained by subdividing the rim edge $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$.\n\nAre the graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ isomorphic?\n\nA. Yes, because both $G_1$ and $G_2$ have 6 vertices and 9 edges.\nB. Yes, because the degree sequences of $G_1$ and $G_2$ are identical.\nC. No, because the vertex of degree 2 in $G_1$ is part of a 3-cycle, while the vertex of degree 2 in $G_2$ is not.\nD. No, because the degree-4 vertex in $G_1$ is adjacent to a degree-2 vertex, while the degree-4 vertex in $G_2$ is not.\nE. The question cannot be answered as the choice of which spoke or rim edge to subdivide affects the resulting graph's structure.", "solution": "Start with the wheel graph $W_5$ on vertices $\\{c,v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4\\}$, where $c$ is adjacent to all $v_i$ and the $v_i$ form a 4-cycle. In $W_5$, the degrees are: $\\deg(c)=4$ and $\\deg(v_i)=3$ for $i\\in\\{1,2,3,4\\}$. The graph has $8$ edges (four spokes and four rim edges).\n\nSubdividing an edge $\\{u,v\\}$ removes that edge and introduces a new vertex $w$ with edges $\\{u,w\\}$ and $\\{w,v\\}$. This increases the vertex count by $1$ and the edge count by $1$.\n\nFor $G_1$ (subdivide the spoke $\\{c,v_1\\}$): introduce a new vertex $s$ and replace $\\{c,v_1\\}$ by $\\{c,s\\}$ and $\\{s,v_1\\}$. Then $\\deg(c)$ remains $4$ (loses $v_1$, gains $s$), $\\deg(v_1)$ remains $3$ (loses $c$, gains $s$), $\\deg(v_2)=\\deg(v_3)=\\deg(v_4)=3$, and the new vertex has $\\deg(s)=2$. Thus $G_1$ has one vertex of degree $4$, four vertices of degree $3$, and one vertex of degree $2$. It has $6$ vertices and $9$ edges.\n\nFor $G_2$ (subdivide the rim edge $\\{v_1,v_2\\}$): introduce a new vertex $r$ and replace $\\{v_1,v_2\\}$ by $\\{v_1,r\\}$ and $\\{r,v_2\\}$. Then $\\deg(c)=4$ (unchanged), $\\deg(v_1)$ and $\\deg(v_2)$ remain $3$ (each loses one neighbor and gains $r$), $\\deg(v_3)=\\deg(v_4)=3$, and $\\deg(r)=2$. Thus $G_2$ also has one vertex of degree $4$, four of degree $3$, and one of degree $2$, and has $6$ vertices and $9$ edges.\n\nTherefore, the degree sequences and the pair $(\\text{number of vertices},\\text{number of edges})$ coincide for $G_1$ and $G_2$, so options A and B alone do not establish isomorphism, since isomorphism requires more than matching degree sequences and sizes.\n\nTo decide isomorphism, use the invariant that isomorphisms preserve degrees and adjacency. Each graph has a unique vertex of degree $4$ and a unique vertex of degree $2$. Any isomorphism must map the degree-$4$ vertex to the degree-$4$ vertex and the degree-$2$ vertex to the degree-$2$ vertex.\n\nIn $G_1$, the degree-$4$ vertex is $c$ and the degree-$2$ vertex is $s$. They are adjacent because the edge $\\{c,s\\}$ was created by subdividing the spoke. In $G_2$, the degree-$4$ vertex is $c$ and the degree-$2$ vertex is $r$. They are not adjacent, because $r$ is only adjacent to $v_1$ and $v_2$. Since adjacency between the unique degree-$4$ and degree-$2$ vertices differs between $G_1$ and $G_2$, no isomorphism can exist. Hence the graphs are not isomorphic.\n\nFor completeness, the statement in option C is false: in $G_1$ the degree-$2$ vertex $s$ is adjacent only to $c$ and $v_1$, which are not adjacent to each other, so $s$ is not in any $3$-cycle; similarly, in $G_2$ the degree-$2$ vertex $r$ is adjacent to $v_1$ and $v_2$, which are not adjacent after subdivision, so $r$ is not in any $3$-cycle.\n\nTherefore, the correct reason is that the degree-$4$ vertex is adjacent to the degree-$2$ vertex in $G_1$ but not in $G_2$, so the graphs are not isomorphic.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1500405"}]}
