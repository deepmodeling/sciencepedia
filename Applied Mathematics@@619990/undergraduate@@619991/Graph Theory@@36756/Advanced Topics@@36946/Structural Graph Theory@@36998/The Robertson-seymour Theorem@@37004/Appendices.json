An edge contraction is the operation of removing an edge $(u,v)$ and merging its two incident vertices, $u$ and $v$, into a new single vertex. The new vertex is adjacent to all vertices that were previously adjacent to either $u$ or $v$.\n\nConsider the 3-dimensional cube graph, denoted as $Q_3$. The vertex set of $Q_3$ can be represented by all 3-bit binary strings: $\\{000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111\\}$. An edge exists between two vertices if and only if their binary string representations differ in exactly one bit position. For example, vertex $000$ is connected to vertices $001$, $010$, and $100$.\n\nThe complete graph on four vertices, denoted $K_4$, is a graph with four vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. One method to obtain a $K_4$ minor from $Q_3$ is to find a perfect matching in $Q_3$ and contract all four of its edges. A perfect matching is a set of edges where no two edges share a vertex, and every vertex in the graph is an endpoint of one of the edges.\n\nWhich of the following sets of edges represents a perfect matching in $Q_3$ that, upon contraction of all four edges, results in a graph isomorphic to $K_4$?\n\nA. $\\{(000, 100), (001, 101), (010, 110), (011, 111)\\}$\n\nB. $\\{(000, 001), (001, 011), (110, 100), (101, 111)\\}$\n\nC. $\\{(000, 111), (001, 110), (010, 101), (100, 011)\\}$\n\nD. $\\{(000, 010), (001, 101), (011, 111), (100, 110)\\}$\n\nE. $\\{(000, 001), (110, 111), (100, 110), (011, 001)\\}$", "solution": "We use the definition of $Q_{3}$: vertices are $3$-bit strings, and an edge exists between two vertices if and only if their Hamming distance is $1$. A perfect matching is a set of $4$ edges that are pairwise vertex-disjoint and cover all $8$ vertices. Upon contracting a perfect matching $\\{(u_{i},v_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{4}$, the graph has four supervertices $U_{i}=\\{u_{i},v_{i}\\}$; two supervertices $U_{i}$ and $U_{j}$ are adjacent in the contracted graph if and only if there exists at least one edge in $Q_{3}$ between a vertex in $U_{i}$ and a vertex in $U_{j}$. To obtain a graph isomorphic to $K_{4}$, every pair among the four supervertices must be adjacent.\n\nCheck each option:\n\nOption A: $\\{(000,100),(001,101),(010,110),(011,111)\\}$. This is a perfect matching (all four edges are valid and vertex-disjoint). After contraction, the supervertices are $A_{1}=\\{000,100\\}$, $A_{2}=\\{001,101\\}$, $A_{3}=\\{010,110\\}$, $A_{4}=\\{011,111\\}$.

Hence the contracted graph is not complete; this does not yield $K_{4}$.\n\nOption B: $\\{(000,001),(001,011),(110,100),(101,111)\\}$. This is not a matching because $(000,001)$ and $(001,011)$ share vertex $001$.\n\nOption C: $\\{(000,111),(001,110),(010,101),(100,011)\\}$.

This graph is connected, bipartite, Eulerian, and Hamiltonian by standard properties of even cycles.\n\nPerform a single edge contraction on the edge $(v_{1},v_{2})$. By the definition of edge contraction, we replace $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ by a new vertex $w$ and make $w$ adjacent to all vertices that were adjacent to either $v_{1}$ or $v_{2}$, excluding $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$. In $C_{2n}$, the neighbors are $\\{v_{2n},v_{2}\\}$ for $v_{1}$ and $\\{v_{1},v_{3}\\}$ for $v_{2}$, so $w$ becomes adjacent to $v_{2n}$ and $v_{3}$.

Therefore $G'$ is the odd cycle $C_{2n-1}$.\n\nNow verify each property under this specific transformation:\n- Connectedness: Edge contraction does not disconnect a graph, so $G'$ is connected.\n- Eulerian: In $C_{2n}$, every vertex has degree $2$. Under contracting $(u,v)$, the new vertex has degree $\\deg(u)+\\deg(v)-2$. Here $\\deg(v_{1})=\\deg(v_{2})=2$, so the new degree is $2+2-2=2$, and all other vertices retain degree $2$. Hence all degrees in $G'$ are even, so $G'$ is Eulerian.\n- Bipartiteness: A graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no cycle of odd length. Since $G'$ contains the odd cycle of length $2n-1$, $G'$ is not bipartite, whereas $C_{2n}$ is bipartite. Therefore bipartiteness is not preserved under this minor operation.\n- Hamiltonicity: Since $G'=C_{2n-1}$, it has a Hamiltonian cycle (the entire cycle itself), so Hamiltonicity is preserved in this instance.\n\nHence, the specific transformation from $C_{2n}$ to $G'$ demonstrates that the property of being a bipartite graph is not minor-closed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1546364"}, {"introduction": "A key consequence of the Robertson-Seymour theorem is that any minor-closed property can be characterized by a finite set of forbidden minors.
