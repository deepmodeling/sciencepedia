An edge contraction on an edge $(u, v)$ removes the edge and merges its two endpoints, $u$ and $v$, into a single new vertex $w$. Any edges that were incident to either $u$ or $v$ become incident to $w$. If this process creates multiple edges between the same two vertices, they are merged into a single edge to ensure the resulting graph is simple (contains no loops or multiple edges between the same two vertices).\n\nConsider the 4-cycle graph, denoted $C_4$. This is a simple graph with 4 vertices and 4 edges, arranged in a square. From the list below, identify all the graphs that are non-isomorphic, connected, simple minors of $C_4$.\n\nFor clarity, the graphs listed are defined as:\n- $K_n$: The complete graph on $n$ vertices, where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. $K_1$ is a single vertex, and $K_2$ is a single edge between two vertices.\n- $P_n$: The path graph on $n$ vertices, consisting of $n$ vertices $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n$ and $n-1$ edges $(v_i, v_{i+1})$ for $i=1, \\dots, n-1$.\n- $C_n$: The cycle graph on $n$ vertices, formed by taking a path graph $P_n$ and adding an edge between $v_1$ and $v_n$.\n- $K_{1,3}$: The claw graph, a tree with one central vertex connected to three leaf vertices.

While every subgraph is technically a minor (obtainable through only vertex and edge deletions), the reverse is not true. The power of edge contraction is what creates this important difference, as it can generate adjacencies that were not present in the original graph. This problem challenges you to construct a concrete example that perfectly illustrates this key concept, helping you to internalize how minors are a more general and powerful structural notion than subgraphs [@problem_id:1507876].", "problem": "In graph theory, we distinguish between subgraphs and minors.

Contracting an edge merges its endpoints and preserves adjacency to other vertices.\n\nWe analyze each option:\n\nA. $E_{A}$ is the $5$-cycle $1-2-3-4-5-1$. This graph does not contain $C_{4}$ as a subgraph, because any selection of $4$ vertices from a $5$-cycle induces at most a path and does not include the needed fourth edge to complete a $4$-cycle. However, $C_{4}$ is a minor: contract one edge of the $5$-cycle, for instance contract $(5,1)$ to merge $\\{5,1\\}$ into a single vertex $w$, producing the $4$-cycle $w-2-3-4-w$. Therefore, $A$ contains $C_{4}$ as a minor but not as a subgraph.\n\nB. $E_{B}$ contains the edges $(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,1)$, which already form a $4$-cycle on vertices $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$.

The vertices $\\{1,3,4,5\\}$ with edges $(1,3),(3,4),(4,5),(5,1)$ form a $4$-cycle, so $C_{4}$ is a subgraph. Thus this option does not satisfy the requirement.\n\nE. $E_{E}$ is the disjoint union of a triangle on $\\{1,2,3\\}$ and an edge $(4,5)$. Any connected minor must be contained in a single connected component. The triangle component has only three vertices, so it cannot yield $C_{4}$ as a minor (a minor cannot increase the number of vertices needed for a connected graph like $C_{4}$). The edge component is too small as well. Hence $C_{4}$ is not a minor and also not a subgraph.

A major part of the answer lies in their ability to characterize entire families of graphs. A graph property is called 'minor-closed' if, whenever a graph possesses that property, all of its minors do as well. In this exercise, you will investigate several fundamental graph properties—such as being a forest, planar, or bipartite—to determine which of them are minor-closed [@problem_id:1554444]. Discovering which property fails this test, and constructing the counterexample, reveals a deep insight into the structural consequences of the edge contraction operation.", "problem": "In graph theory, a graph $H$ is a minor of another graph $G$ if $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by a sequence of zero or more edge deletions, vertex deletions, and edge contractions.

Let $F$ be a forest (i.e., acyclic). Deleting edges or vertices cannot create cycles, so those operations preserve being a forest. It remains to check edge contraction. Consider contracting an edge $e=(u,v)$ of $F$ to a vertex $w$, yielding $F/e$. Suppose for contradiction that $F/e$ has a cycle $C$. If $C$ avoids $w$, then $C$ already existed in $F$, contradicting that $F$ is acyclic. If $C$ uses $w$, then in $F$ the edges of $C$ incident to $w$ correspond to edges incident to $u$ or $v$, which trace a $u$–$v$ path in $F$ that avoids $e$. Together with $e$, this forms a cycle in $F$, again a contradiction. Hence $F/e$ is acyclic. Therefore forests are minor-closed.\n\nB) Outerplanar graphs are minor-closed. Deleting vertices or edges from an outerplanar drawing clearly preserves an outerplanar drawing. For edge contraction, in an outerplanar embedding, contracting an edge along its drawing produces a graph that can still be embedded with all vertices on the boundary of the unbounded face and without crossings. Equivalently, the well-known forbidden minor characterization states that a graph is outerplanar if and only if it has no $K_{4}$ or $K_{2,3}$ as a minor; such a characterization implies minor-closedness.\n\nC) Planar graphs are minor-closed. Vertex and edge deletions preserve planarity. For edge contraction, in a planar embedding one can contract an edge within a neighborhood of that edge without creating crossings, so the resulting graph is planar. Equivalently, by Wagner’s theorem, a graph is planar if and only if it has no $K_{5}$ or $K_{3,3}$ as a minor, which again characterizes a minor-closed class.\n\nD) Bipartite graphs are not minor-closed. A counterexample via edge contraction: start with the $4$-cycle $C_{4}$ with vertices $v_{1},v_{2},v_{3},v_{4}$ in order, which is bipartite. Contract the edge $(v_{1},v_{2})$ to a vertex $w$. The resulting graph has edges $w$–$v_{3}$, $v_{3}$–$v_{4}$, and $v_{4}$–$w$, which is a $3$-cycle $C_{3}$, not bipartite. Thus a minor of a bipartite graph need not be bipartite, so bipartiteness is not minor-closed.\n\nTherefore, among the listed properties, only option D is not minor-closed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1554444"}]}
