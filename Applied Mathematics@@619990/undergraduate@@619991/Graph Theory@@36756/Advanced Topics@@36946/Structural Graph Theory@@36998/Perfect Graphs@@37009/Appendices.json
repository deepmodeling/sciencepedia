Let $G=(V, E)$ be a simple undirected graph, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges.\n\nA key concept is that of an *induced subgraph*. An induced subgraph $H$ of $G$ is a graph formed from a subset of vertices $V' \\subseteq V$ and *all* edges from $E$ that have both endpoints in $V'$.\n\nTwo important numerical invariants of a graph are its clique number and chromatic number:\n- The *clique number* of a graph $G$, denoted $\\omega(G)$, is the number of vertices in a maximum clique in $G$. A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge.\n- The *chromatic number* of a graph $G$, denoted $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of $G$ such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nA graph $G$ is defined as a *perfect graph* if, for every induced subgraph $H$ of $G$ (including $G$ itself), its chromatic number is equal to its clique number; that is, $\\chi(H) = \\omega(H)$.\n\nConsider the path graph on four vertices, denoted $P_4$. This graph has the vertex set $V = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\\}$ and the edge set $E = \\{(v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3), (v_3, v_4)\\}$.

We can group these subgraphs by their number of vertices. Due to symmetry in the graph structure, we only need to consider non-isomorphic cases. The edges of the parent graph $P_4$ are $(v_1, v_2)$, $(v_2, v_3)$, and $(v_3, v_4)$.\n\n1.  **Induced subgraphs on 1 vertex:**\n    Any subgraph induced by a single vertex (e.g., the set $\\{v_1\\}$) is an isolated vertex, a graph denoted $K_1$.\n    For this subgraph $H = K_1$, the largest clique consists of the single vertex, so its size is 1. Thus, $\\omega(H) = 1$.\n    A single vertex requires only one color. Thus, $\\chi(H) = 1$.\n    This analysis yields the ordered pair $(\\omega(H), \\chi(H)) = (1, 1)$.\n\n2.  **Induced subgraphs on 2 vertices:**\n    There are two non-isomorphic cases for subgraphs induced by two vertices.\n    -   Case 2a: The two vertices are adjacent in $P_4$. An example is the set $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$. The induced subgraph has the edge $(v_1, v_2)$ and is isomorphic to $K_2$. For this subgraph $H=K_2$, the largest clique contains both vertices, so $\\omega(H) = 2$. Two vertices connected by an edge require two different colors, so $\\chi(H) = 2$. This gives the pair $(2, 2)$.\n    -   Case 2b: The two vertices are not adjacent in $P_4$. An example is the set $\\{v_1, v_3\\}$. The induced subgraph has no edges, consisting of two isolated vertices. For this subgraph $H$, the largest clique is a single vertex, so $\\omega(H) = 1$. Since there are no edges, all vertices can be the same color, so $\\chi(H) = 1$. This gives the pair $(1, 1)$.\n\n3.  **Induced subgraphs on 3 vertices:**\n    There are two non-isomorphic cases for subgraphs induced by three vertices.\n    -   Case 3a: The three vertices form a connected path. An example is $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$. The induced edges are $(v_1, v_2)$ and $(v_2, v_3)$, forming the path graph $P_3$. For this subgraph $H=P_3$, the largest clique is any single edge (e.g., $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$), so $\\omega(H) = 2$. This graph is bipartite and has an edge, so it requires two colors (e.g., color $v_1, v_3$ red and $v_2$ blue). Thus, $\\chi(H) = 2$. This gives the pair $(2, 2)$.\n    -   Case 3b: The three vertices do not form a connected path. An example is $\\{v_1, v_2, v_4\\}$. The only edge from $P_4$ with both endpoints in this set is $(v_1, v_2)$. The induced subgraph consists of an edge and an isolated vertex ($K_2 \\cup K_1$). For this subgraph $H$, the largest clique is the edge $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$, so $\\omega(H) = 2$. Since the graph contains an edge, it needs at least two colors. A 2-coloring is possible (e.g., $v_1$ red, $v_2$ blue, $v_4$ red). Thus, $\\chi(H) = 2$. This gives the pair $(2, 2)$.\n\n4.  **Induced subgraph on 4 vertices:**\n    The only subgraph on 4 vertices is $P_4$ itself, induced by the set $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\\}$.\n    For this subgraph $H = P_4$, the largest clique is any single edge (e.g., $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$), giving $\\omega(H) = 2$.\n    The graph $P_4$ is bipartite (and not edgeless), meaning it is 2-colorable but not 1-colorable. A valid 2-coloring is to give $\\{v_1, v_3\\}$ one color and $\\{v_2, v_4\\}$ another. Thus, $\\chi(H) = 2$.\n    This gives the pair $(2, 2)$.\n\nBy examining all possible non-empty induced subgraphs, we have found the following $(\\omega, \\chi)$ pairs:\n- From 1-vertex subgraphs: $(1, 1)$\n- From 2-vertex subgraphs: $(2, 2)$ and $(1, 1)$\n- From 3-vertex subgraphs: $(2, 2)$\n- From 4-vertex subgraphs: $(2, 2)$\n\nThe set $S$ of all unique pairs generated is the collection of these distinct pairs. Therefore, $S = \\{(1, 1), (2, 2)\\}$.\nThis result also confirms that $P_4$ is a perfect graph, as for every induced subgraph $H$, we found that $\\omega(H) = \\chi(H)$.\n\nComparing our resulting set $S$ with the given choices, the correct one is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1526462"}, {"introduction": "Not all graphs are perfect, and understanding the structures that \"break\" this property is key to a deeper appreciation of the theory.
