The design specifies a direct, high-bandwidth physical cable between every distinct pair of servers. This network will be laid out on a single, large circuit board. Due to manufacturing constraints, the physical cables, which can be modeled as lines, are not allowed to cross each other. To satisfy this constraint, the company can replace some physical cables with wireless optical links, which are not restricted by the planar layout. Assuming each wireless link is significantly more expensive than a physical cable, what is the absolute minimum number of physical cables that must be replaced by wireless links to ensure the entire network can be built on the circuit board without any cables crossing?", "solution": "Model the six servers and their pairwise physical cables as the complete graph $K_{6}$ with $n=6$ vertices and $m=\\binom{6}{2}=15$ edges. The physical cables must be drawn without crossings, so the subgraph consisting of physical cables must be planar.\n\nFor any simple planar graph with $n \\geq 3$ vertices, Euler’s formula and face-degree counting give the maximal number of edges. Euler’s formula is\n$$\nn - m + f = 2,\n$$\nwhere $f$ is the number of faces in a planar embedding.

Since $K_{6}$ has $15$ edges, at least $15 - 12 = 3$ edges must be removed from the physical (planar) cable graph. Interpreting edge removals as replacing those cables with wireless links, at least $3$ physical cables must be replaced.\n\nTo show that $3$ suffices, remove a perfect matching of $3$ disjoint edges from $K_{6}$. The remaining $12$-edge graph is isomorphic to $K_{2,2,2}$ (the octahedral graph), which is planar and indeed a triangulation (it satisfies $3f = 2m$ with $n=6$, $m=12$, yielding $f=8$ and $n - m + f = 2$).

The design involves two sets of components: a set $U$ of four processing units $\\{u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4\\}$, and a set $V$ of four memory modules $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\\}$. According to the design specification, every processing unit must be connected to every memory module with a dedicated electrical trace. Traces can be placed on either the top layer or the bottom layer of the PCB. However, two different traces on the same layer are not allowed to cross each other to avoid interference. The components themselves are considered points, and the traces are lines connecting them.\n\nIs it possible to route all the required connections on the two-layer PCB? Select the most accurate statement from the options below.\n\nA. Yes, it is possible because the entire connection layout can be drawn on a single layer without any crossings.\n\nB. Yes, it is possible because the required 16 connections can be partitioned into two groups, where each group of connections can be drawn on a separate layer without any crossings.\n\nC. No, it is not possible because the graph of connections has too many edges relative to its number of vertices to be decomposed into two planar subgraphs.\n\nD. No, it is not possible because the connection graph contains the Kuratowski graph $K_{3,3}$ as a minor, and any such graph requires at least three layers.\n\nE.

Thus there are $v=8$ vertices and $m=16$ edges.\n\nFirst, check whether a single layer suffices. Any planar bipartite graph with $v \\ge 3$ satisfies the edge bound\n$$\nm \\le 2v-4,\n$$\nwhich follows from Euler’s formula together with the fact that every face has length at least $4$ in a bipartite planar embedding (so $4f \\le 2m$ and $m - v + f = 2$ imply $m \\le 2v - 4$). For $v=8$, this gives $m \\le 12$. Since $K_{4,4}$ has $m=16 > 12$, it is not planar, so it cannot be drawn without crossings on a single layer. Therefore option A is false.\n\nNext, determine whether two layers suffice. A lower bound on the number of planar layers (the thickness) needed is\n$$\nt \\ge \\left\\lceil \\frac{m}{2v-4} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{16}{12} \\right\\rceil = 2.\n$$\nTo show that two layers are sufficient, explicitly partition the $16$ edges into two planar subgraphs on the same vertex set.\n\nIndex arithmetic is taken modulo $4$. Define the first layer’s edge set by\n$$\nE_{1}=\\{\\,u_{i}v_{i},\\ u_{i+1}v_{i}:\\ i\\in\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\,\\}.\n$$\nEach $u_{i}$ has degree $2$ in $E_{1}$ (adjacent to $v_{i}$ and $v_{i-1}$), and each $v_{i}$ has degree $2$ (adjacent to $u_{i}$ and $u_{i+1}$). Hence $E_{1}$ is a single $8$-cycle\n$$\nu_{1} - v_{1} - u_{2} - v_{2} - u_{3} - v_{3} - u_{4} - v_{4} - u_{1},\n$$\nwhich is planar.\n\nLet the second layer contain the complementary edges\n$$\nE_{2}=E(K_{4,4})\\setminus E_{1}=\\{\\,u_{i}v_{i+1},\\ u_{i}v_{i+2}:\\ i\\in\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\,\\}.\n$$\nAgain, each vertex has degree $2$ in $E_{2}$, and a direct traversal shows it is a single $8$-cycle, for example\n$$\nu_{1} - v_{2} - u_{4} - v_{1} - u_{3} - v_{4} - u_{2} - v_{3} - u_{1},\n$$\nwhich is planar.\n\nThus $K_{4,4}$ is the union of two planar subgraphs, so all required connections can be routed on two layers with no intra-layer crossings. Option C is false because the edge count does not preclude a decomposition into two planar subgraphs, and the explicit decomposition above shows it exists. Option D is false because containing $K_{3,3}$ as a minor does not force thickness at least $3$; indeed $K_{3,3}$ itself has thickness $2$. Option E is false because planarity and such a decomposition depend on the abstract graph, not on specific geometric placements; planar embeddings allow routing as curves to avoid crossings regardless of vertex locations.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that two layers suffice via a partition of the edges into two planar groups.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1548713"}, {"introduction": "What if we are limited to a single layer and must accept that some connections will cross?

The initial design involves two sets of three terminals each, set $U$ and set $V$. Every terminal in set $U$ must be connected by a conductive trace to every terminal in set $V$. This connection scheme can be modeled by a complete bipartite graph, denoted $K_{3,3}$. The engineers aim to lay out the traces on the 2D plane of the PCB with the minimum possible number of crossings, a value known as the graph's crossing number, $cr(G)$.\n\nDue to a design revision, a single \"signal integrity booster\" must be inserted along one of the existing traces. In graph-theoretic terms, this operation is called an edge subdivision: one edge of the graph is chosen and replaced by a path of length two by adding a new vertex (the booster) along its length. Let the initial graph be $G = K_{3,3}$ and the new, modified graph be $G'$. The new layout for $G'$ must also be designed to have the minimum possible number of trace crossings.\n\nYou are tasked to evaluate a design metric, $Q$, defined by the properties of the initial graph.

You may use the fact that any simple, bipartite, planar graph with $v \\ge 3$ vertices and $e$ edges must satisfy the inequality $e \\le 2v - 4$.\n\nThe final answer should be a single integer.", "solution": "Let $G=K_{3,3}$. The graph $K_{3,3}$ has $v=6$ vertices and $e=9$ edges. For any simple bipartite planar graph with $v \\ge 3$ and $e$ edges, the inequality $e \\le 2v - 4$ must hold. Substituting $v=6$ gives $e \\le 8$. Therefore a planar subgraph on these six vertices can have at most $8$ edges. Since $K_{3,3}$ has $9$ edges, it cannot be contained in a single planar subgraph, so at least two planar subgraphs are necessary to cover all edges. Hence $\\theta(G) \\ge 2$.\n\nNext, $K_{3,3}$ is a minimal nonplanar graph, so removing any one edge yields a planar graph. Let $H_{1}$ be $K_{3,3}$ with one edge removed (which is planar with $8$ edges), and let $H_{2}$ be the single removed edge (which is planar). Then $G=H_{1} \\cup H_{2}$ with both $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ planar, so $\\theta(G) \\le 2$.

Therefore\n$$\ncr(G)=1.\n$$\n\nLet $G'$ be obtained from $G$ by subdividing one edge (inserting a degree-$2$ vertex on that edge). Subdividing an edge does not change the crossing number. To see $cr(G') \\le cr(G)$, take a drawing of $G$ with $cr(G)$ crossings and place the new vertex along the chosen edge’s curve; this yields a drawing of $G'$ with the same number of crossings. To see $cr(G) \\le cr(G')$, take a drawing of $G'$ with $cr(G')$ crossings and merge the two edges incident to the inserted vertex into a single curve following their union; this produces a drawing of $G$ with at most $cr(G')$ crossings.
