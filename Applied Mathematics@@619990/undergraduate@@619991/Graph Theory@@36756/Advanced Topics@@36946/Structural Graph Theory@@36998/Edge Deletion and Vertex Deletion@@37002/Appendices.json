When we consider deleting a single edge, the network either stays connected or breaks apart. This exercise [@problem_id:1500119] explores this fundamental dichotomy by asking you to identify which links in a simple, modified network are \"redundant\"â€”that is, which ones can be removed without losing connectivity. This practice sharpens your ability to spot cycles, as the non-critical edges are precisely those that belong to one.", "problem": "A data center operates a set of $N$ servers, labeled sequentially as $S_1, S_2, \\dots, S_N$. The initial network topology connects these servers in a linear chain, where server $S_k$ is linked to server $S_{k+1}$ for all $k$ from $1$ to $N-1$. This configuration is known as a path graph. To enhance network resilience against single-point failures, the administrators install one additional high-speed fiber optic cable that directly connects server $S_i$ to server $S_j$, where $1 \\le i < j \\le N$.\n\nThe network is defined as \"operational\" if every server can communicate with every other server, meaning the graph representing the network is connected. A link failure corresponds to the removal of an edge from this graph.\n\nGiven $N=100$, $i=25$, and $j=75$, determine the total number of individual links (from either the original chain or the added cable) whose failure would still leave the network operational. Provide your answer as a single integer.", "solution": "Model the network as a graph $G$ with vertices $S_{1},\\dots,S_{100}$ and edges consisting of the path edges $\\{S_{k},S_{k+1}\\}$ for $k=1,\\dots,99$ plus one extra edge $\\{S_{25},S_{75}\\}$. The network remains operational after removal of a link if and only if the removed edge is not a bridge. An edge is not a bridge if and only if it belongs to some cycle.\n\nAdding the edge $\\{S_{25},S_{75}\\}$ creates exactly one simple cycle: the unique path in the original chain from $S_{25}$ to $S_{75}$ together with the added edge. The path from $S_{25}$ to $S_{75}$ uses the consecutive edges $\\{S_{k},S_{k+1}\\}$ for $k=25,26,\\dots,74$, which is a total of $75-25=j-i$ edges. Therefore, the cycle contains $(j-i)$ path edges plus the added edge, for a total of $(j-i)+1$ edges, all of which are not bridges. All remaining path edges lie outside this cycle and are bridges, so their removal would disconnect the network.\n\nSubstituting $i=25$ and $j=75$ gives $(j-i)+1=50+1=51$. Hence, there are $51$ links whose failure still leaves the network operational.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{51}$$", "id": "1500119"}, {"introduction": "While deleting single edges is illustrative, real-world networks must withstand multiple failures, which often involves the loss of entire nodes (vertices). This brings us to the concept of vertex connectivity, a crucial measure of a graph's resilience. In this problem [@problem_id:1500127], you will calculate the vertex connectivity, denoted $\\kappa(G)$, of a highly symmetric and robust network structure, providing a hands-on application of fundamental graph theory principles.", "problem": "A team is designing a highly resilient, decentralized communication network. The network architecture consists of six nodes. Four of these nodes, which we can label $N_1, N_2, N_3, N_4$, are arranged in a primary communication ring. In this ring structure, $N_1$ is linked to $N_2$ and $N_4$; $N_2$ is linked to $N_3$ and $N_1$; $N_3$ is linked to $N_4$ and $N_2$; and $N_4$ is linked to $N_1$ and $N_3$.\n\nIn addition to the ring, there are two special hub nodes, a North hub ($H_N$) and a South hub ($H_S$). To ensure high connectivity, every node in the primary ring ($N_1, N_2, N_3,$ and $N_4$) is connected by a direct link to both $H_N$ and $H_S$.\n\nA node is considered \"offline\" if it is removed from the network, and all communication links attached to it are severed. The network is defined as \"disconnected\" if there exists at least one pair of functioning (i.e., not offline) nodes between which no communication path can be established, even by routing through other functioning nodes.\n\nDetermine the minimum number of nodes that must be taken offline to cause the network to become disconnected.", "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum number of nodes that need to be removed from a network to make it disconnected. In graph theory, this is known as the vertex connectivity of the graph, denoted by $\\kappa(G)$.\n\nFirst, let's formally define the graph $G=(V, E)$ described in the problem.\nThe set of vertices (nodes) is $V = \\{N_1, N_2, N_3, N_4, H_N, H_S\\}$. This graph has $|V|=6$ vertices.\n\nThe set of edges (links) $E$ can be described as follows:\n1.  Ring connections: $\\{ (N_1, N_2), (N_2, N_3), (N_3, N_4), (N_4, N_1) \\}$.\n2.  Hub connections: For each $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, there are edges $(N_i, H_N)$ and $(N_i, H_S)$. This gives the set of edges $\\{ (N_1, H_N), (N_2, H_N), (N_3, H_N), (N_4, H_N), (N_1, H_S), (N_2, H_S), (N_3, H_S), (N_4, H_S) \\}$.\n\nThis graph structure is isomorphic to the graph of an octahedron, where $H_N$ and $H_S$ are the antipodal vertices, and $N_1, N_2, N_3, N_4$ form the \"equator\".\n\nTo find the vertex connectivity $\\kappa(G)$, we can use some fundamental properties of graphs. A key theorem in graph theory states that for any graph $G$, the vertex connectivity is less than or equal to the minimum degree of any vertex in the graph. That is, $\\kappa(G) \\le \\delta(G)$.\n\nLet's compute the degree of each vertex in $G$:\n-   Degree of $H_N$: It is connected to $N_1, N_2, N_3, N_4$. So, $\\deg(H_N) = 4$.\n-   Degree of $H_S$: It is connected to $N_1, N_2, N_3, N_4$. So, $\\deg(H_S) = 4$.\n-   Degree of any $N_i$ (e.g., $N_1$): It is connected to two nodes in the ring ($N_2, N_4$) and the two hubs ($H_N, H_S$). So, $\\deg(N_1) = 4$. By symmetry, $\\deg(N_i) = 4$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nSince every vertex has a degree of 4, the minimum degree of the graph is $\\delta(G) = 4$.\nFrom the theorem $\\kappa(G) \\le \\delta(G)$, we get an upper bound: $\\kappa(G) \\le 4$.\n\nTo find a lower bound for $\\kappa(G)$, we can use Menger's Theorem. The vertex version of Menger's Theorem states that for any two non-adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$ in a graph $G$, the minimum number of vertices in a set that separates $u$ from $v$ (a $u-v$ separator) is equal to the maximum number of internally vertex-disjoint paths between $u$ and $v$. The vertex connectivity $\\kappa(G)$ is the minimum size of a $u-v$ separator over all pairs of non-adjacent vertices.\n\nLet's choose the pair of non-adjacent vertices $H_N$ and $H_S$. We need to find the maximum number of internally vertex-disjoint paths between them.\nA path from $H_N$ to $H_S$ must go through one of the ring nodes. The possible paths are of the form $H_N - N_i - H_S$. Let's list them:\n1.  Path 1: $H_N - N_1 - H_S$\n2.  Path 2: $H_N - N_2 - H_S$\n3.  Path 3: $H_N - N_3 - H_S$\n4.  Path 4: $H_N - N_4 - H_S$\n\nThe internal vertices of these paths are $\\{N_1\\}$, $\\{N_2\\}$, $\\{N_3\\}$, and $\\{N_4\\}$, respectively. Since these sets of internal vertices are disjoint from each other, these four paths are internally vertex-disjoint.\n\nAccording to Menger's Theorem, the minimum number of vertices required to separate $H_N$ from $H_S$ is equal to the maximum number of internally vertex-disjoint paths between them, which is 4. This means that any vertex cut that separates $H_N$ and $H_S$ must have at least 4 vertices.\n\nSince the vertex connectivity $\\kappa(G)$ is the minimum size of a vertex set whose removal disconnects the graph, it must be at least as large as the size of the minimum separator for any pair of non-adjacent vertices. Therefore, we have a lower bound: $\\kappa(G) \\ge 4$.\n\nCombining our upper and lower bounds:\n$4 \\le \\kappa(G) \\le 4$\n\nThis implies that the vertex connectivity is exactly 4.\nThe minimum number of nodes that must be taken offline to disconnect the network is 4. An example of such a set of nodes is $\\{N_1, N_2, N_3, N_4\\}$. If these four nodes are removed, the remaining nodes are $H_N$ and $H_S$, which are not connected to each other, thus disconnecting the network.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "1500127"}, {"introduction": "So far, we have focused on deleting elements while trying to maintain connectivity. However, sometimes the goal of edge deletion is to deliberately alter a graph's properties, such as removing all cycles to prevent infinite loops.

The workstations are also connected in a ring topology, where each workstation is connected to exactly two other distinct workstations, forming a single closed loop that includes all $n$ workstations.\n\nTo prevent network instabilities caused by endlessly circulating data packets, the network must be configured to be acyclic, meaning it should not contain any closed loops or cycles. This is achieved by disabling some of the communication links. To minimize operational costs, the goal is to disable the minimum possible number of links to render the entire network acyclic.\n\nDetermine the minimum number of links that must be disabled. Express your answer as a function of $n$.", "solution": "Model the network as a graph with one central server (hub) and $n$ workstations (peripheral vertices), where:\n- Each workstation is connected to the hub by one link, giving $n$ hub-to-workstation links.\n- The workstations form a cycle (ring) of length $n$, giving $n$ ring links.\n\nThus, the graph has $N = n + 1$ vertices and $m = 2n$ edges.\n\nTo make the network acyclic, the resulting graph must be a forest. A fundamental graph-theoretic fact is that any acyclic graph (a forest) on $N$ vertices with $c$ connected components has exactly $N - c$ edges, so in particular it has at most $N - 1$ edges because $c \\geq 1$.
