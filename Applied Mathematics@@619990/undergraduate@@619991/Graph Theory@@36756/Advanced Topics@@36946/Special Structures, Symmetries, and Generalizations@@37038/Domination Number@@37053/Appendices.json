Hence three additional selections are necessary, giving a total of $4$.\n\nNow determine $\\gamma(G)$. First, no dominating set of size $2$ exists. For any two vertices $x,y$, the union $N[x]\\cup N[y]$ misses at least one of the vertices in $\\{3,5,8\\}$ together with its partner, as can be checked directly or by observing that none of the closed neighborhoods contains more than one among $\\{3,5,8\\}$. Therefore $\\gamma(G)\\geq 3$.\n\nNext, a dominating set of size $3$ exists. For example, let $D=\\{1,4,6\\}$. Then\n$$\nN[1]\\cup N[4]\\cup N[6]=\\{1,2,7,8\\}\\cup\\{3,4,7\\}\\cup\\{5,6,7\\}=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\\}=V,\n$$\nso $D$ dominates $G$.
