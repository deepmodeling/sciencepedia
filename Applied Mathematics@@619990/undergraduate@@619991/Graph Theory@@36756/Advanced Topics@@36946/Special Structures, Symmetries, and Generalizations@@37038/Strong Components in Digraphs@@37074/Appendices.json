A **strong component** (or strongly connected component) of a directed graph is a maximal subgraph where for every pair of vertices $u$ and $v$ in the subgraph, there exists a directed path from $u$ to $v$ and a directed path from $v$ to $u$.\n\nConsider a directed path graph, denoted as $P_n$, with $n$ vertices where $n \\ge 2$. The vertices are labeled $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n$. The set of directed edges in this graph is given by $E = \\{(v_i, v_{i+1}) \\mid 1 \\le i < n\\}$. This structure represents a simple one-way sequence, where one can only travel from a vertex with a lower index to one with a higher index.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate description of the strong components of the directed path graph $P_n$?\n\nA. There is only one strong component, which includes all $n$ vertices $\\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n\\}$.\n\nB.

Since edges go only from lower index to the next higher index, there is a directed path from $v_{i}$ to $v_{j}$ given by the sequence of edges\n$$\n(v_{i},v_{i+1}),(v_{i+1},v_{i+2}),\\dots,(v_{j-1},v_{j}),\n$$\nso a path of length $j-i$ exists from $v_{i}$ to $v_{j}$. \n\nHowever, there is no directed path from $v_{j}$ back to $v_{i}$. To see this, note that every directed edge increases the vertex index by exactly $1$. Therefore, along any directed path starting at $v_{j}$, the sequence of indices is strictly increasing:\n$$\nj = k_{0} < k_{1} < \\dots < k_{t}.\n$$\nHence it is impossible to reach any vertex $v_{i}$ with $i<j$, so no path exists from $v_{j}$ to $v_{i}$ when $i<j$.\n\nTherefore, for $i \\neq j$, $v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$ cannot both lie in the same strong component, because the mutual reachability condition fails. Each single vertex $v_{i}$ trivially has a path to itself (the path of length $0$), so each $\\{v_{i}\\}$ is strongly connected. Moreover, each $\\{v_{i}\\}$ is maximal with this property, since adding any other vertex $v_{j}$ with $j \\neq i$ would break strong connectivity as shown.\n\nThus, there are exactly $n$ strong components, each consisting of a single vertex.

It asks whether ensuring every node has at least one incoming and one outgoing connection is enough to guarantee strong connectivity for the entire graph. By working through this thought experiment, you will discover the crucial difference between local properties and the global property of strong connectivity, and understand why it's a more complex issue than it first appears. [@problem_id:1535703]", "problem": "A systems architect is drafting a blueprint for a new distributed data processing network. The network is modeled as a directed graph (digraph), where the vertices represent processing nodes and a directed edge from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$ signifies that node $u$ can directly send data packets to node $v$.\n\nThe architect proposes a fundamental design rule to ensure the network is robust. This robustness is defined by the property of strong connectivity: for any two distinct nodes $A$ and $B$ in the network, there must be a sequence of one-way connections allowing data to flow from $A$ to $B$. In graph theory terms, a digraph is strongly connected if for every ordered pair of distinct vertices $(u, v)$, there exists a directed path from $u$ to $v$.\n\nThe architect's proposed design rule is:\n**\"For every vertex $v$ in the digraph, both its in-degree (the number of incoming edges) and its out-degree (the number of outgoing edges) must be at least one.\"**\n\nThe architect claims that any network adhering to this rule is guaranteed to be strongly connected.

If every vertex has at least one incoming and one outgoing edge, it is impossible for any part of the graph to be unreachable, guaranteeing a path between any two vertices.\n\nB. The claim is correct. This condition is a well-known requirement for the existence of a directed Hamiltonian cycle, which by definition would visit every vertex and thus make the graph strongly connected.\n\nC. The claim is incorrect. It is possible to construct a counterexample where the graph consists of two or more strongly connected components with edges directed from one component to another, but with no path leading back.\n\nD. The claim is incorrect. The condition only guarantees the absence of source vertices (in-degree 0) and sink vertices (out-degree 0), which is necessary but not sufficient for strong connectivity. A counterexample would be a simple directed cycle, which is not strongly connected.", "solution": "The central question is whether the condition that every vertex in a directed graph has an in-degree of at least one and an out-degree of at least one is sufficient to guarantee that the graph is strongly connected. A directed graph is strongly connected if for any two vertices $u$ and $v$, there is a path from $u$ to $v$ AND a path from $v$ to $u$.\n\nTo evaluate the architect's claim, we can attempt to find a counterexample: a directed graph that satisfies the design rule but is not strongly connected.\n\nLet's consider a graph constructed from two separate components. Let the first component, $C_1$, be a set of vertices $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ with edges $(v_1, v_2)$ and $(v_2, v_1)$. This forms a simple 2-cycle, and this subgraph is strongly connected by itself. Let the second component, $C_2$, be another set of vertices $\\{v_3, v_4\\}$ with edges $(v_3, v_4)$ and $(v_4, v_3)$. This is also a 2-cycle and is strongly connected by itself.\n\nSo far, the graph consists of two disconnected components. The in-degree and out-degree of every vertex is exactly 1.\n- In $C_1$: $\\text{indeg}(v_1)=1$, $\\text{outdeg}(v_1)=1$; $\\text{indeg}(v_2)=1$, $\\text{outdeg}(v_2)=1$.\n- In $C_2$: $\\text{indeg}(v_3)=1$, $\\text{outdeg}(v_3)=1$; $\\text{indeg}(v_4)=1$, $\\text{outdeg}(v_4)=1$.\n\nNow, let's connect these two components with a single directed edge. Let's add an edge from a vertex in $C_1$ to a vertex in $C_2$, for example, the edge $(v_2, v_3)$.\n\nThe resulting graph has the vertex set $V = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\\}$ and the edge set $E = \\{(v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_1), (v_3, v_4), (v_4, v_3), (v_2, v_3)\\}$.\n\nLet's check the in-degrees and out-degrees of all vertices in this new graph:\n- $\\text{indeg}(v_1) = 1$ (from $v_2$), $\\text{outdeg}(v_1) = 1$ (to $v_2$).\n- $\\text{indeg}(v_2) = 1$ (from $v_1$), $\\text{outdeg}(v_2) = 2$ (to $v_1$ and $v_3$).\n- $\\text{indeg}(v_3) = 2$ (from $v_4$ and $v_2$), $\\text{outdeg}(v_3) = 1$ (to $v_4$).\n- $\\text{indeg}(v_4) = 1$ (from $v_3$), $\\text{outdeg}(v_4) = 1$ (to $v_3$).\n\nEvery vertex has an in-degree of at least one and an out-degree of at least one. So, this graph satisfies the architect's design rule.\n\nNow, we check if this graph is strongly connected. Consider the vertices $v_1$ and $v_3$.\n- Is there a path from $v_1$ to $v_3$? Yes, the path is $v_1 \\to v_2 \\to v_3$.\n- Is there a path from $v_3$ to $v_1$? Any path starting from $v_3$ can only move to $v_4$. From $v_4$, the only place to go is back to $v_3$. There are no edges leaving the set of vertices $\\{v_3, v_4\\}$ and leading to the set $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$. Therefore, it is impossible to reach $v_1$ from $v_3$.\n\nSince there is no path from $v_3$ to $v_1$, the graph is not strongly connected. We have successfully constructed a counterexample. Therefore, the architect's claim is incorrect.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n- A: This is incorrect, as demonstrated by our counterexample. The graph is not \"fully reachable\" even though the local degree conditions are met.\n- B: This is incorrect. The condition for a directed Hamiltonian cycle is a much stronger and more complex property (and is an NP-complete problem to determine). The condition for an Eulerian circuit is that the graph is strongly connected AND for every vertex $v$, $\\text{indeg}(v) = \\text{outdeg}(v)$. Our counterexample shows that $\\text{indeg}(v) \\geq 1$ and $\\text{outdeg}(v) \\geq 1$ is not sufficient.\n- C: This is the correct explanation. Our counterexample is precisely a graph with two strongly connected components ($C_1=\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ and $C_2=\\{v_3, v_4\\}$) where there is a directed edge from $C_1$ to $C_2$, but no path back. This structure satisfies the degree requirements but breaks strong connectivity for the overall graph.\n- D: This statement is partially correct in its first clause but incorrect in its second. The condition indeed guarantees no sources or sinks. However, the subsequent claim that \"a simple directed cycle... is not strongly connected\" is false. A simple directed cycle of length $k \\ge 1$ is, by definition, strongly connected, as one can get from any vertex to any other vertex by traversing the cycle.
