For threshold graphs, a powerful tool is the forbidden subgraph characterization, which states a graph is a threshold graph if and only if it does not contain an induced subgraph isomorphic to a path on four vertices ($P_4$), a cycle on four vertices ($C_4$), or two disjoint edges ($2K_2$). This exercise challenges you to apply this theorem to the familiar family of path graphs, helping you develop the crucial skill of identifying induced subgraphs to determine a graph's classification [@problem_id:1549405].", "problem": "In graph theory, a **threshold graph** is a graph that can be constructed from an empty graph by a sequence of operations.

We can show these are threshold graphs by providing a creation sequence for each.\n- For $n=1$, $P_1$ is a single vertex. It can be formed by the creation sequence `0`. It is trivially a threshold graph.\n- For $n=2$, $P_2$ is a single edge. It can be formed by the creation sequence `01`. Vertex $v_1$ is added. Then $v_2$ is added as a universal vertex, connecting to $v_1$. This forms $P_2$. Thus, $P_2$ is a threshold graph.\n- For $n=3$, $P_3$ is a path on three vertices. It is isomorphic to a star graph $K_{1,2}$. It can be formed by the creation sequence `001`. Vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$ are added as isolated vertices.

This practice shifts our focus from forbidden structures to the constructive definition and its deep connection to the graph's degree sequence. You will explore whether a given degree sequence can be realized as a threshold graph, a task that bridges the gap between a graph's numerical properties and its physical structure and highlights the unique properties of this graph class [@problem_id:1549407].", "problem": "In network science, a \"threshold graph\" is a special type of graph that can be constructed from an empty graph by a sequence of operations. Each step in the sequence adds a new vertex, which is either an **isolated vertex** (a vertex with no edges to any existing vertices) or a **dominating vertex** (a vertex connected by an edge to every existing vertex).\n\nA data scientist is analyzing a small collaboration network of five researchers. The number of collaborators for each researcher is measured, yielding the degree sequence $d = (4, 3, 2, 2, 1)$. The scientist hypothesizes that this network structure can be modeled as a threshold graph due to its hierarchical nature.\n\nDetermine if a simple graph with this degree sequence can be a threshold graph.\n\nA. Yes, a threshold graph with this degree sequence exists, and it is the only simple graph with this degree sequence (up to isomorphism).\n\nB. Yes, a threshold graph with this degree sequence exists, but there are other non-isomorphic simple graphs with the same degree sequence.\n\nC. No, a graph with this degree sequence cannot exist because the sum of degrees is odd.\n\nD. No, a threshold graph with this degree sequence cannot exist, although other simple graphs with this sequence might.", "solution": "First, we check if the degree sequence $d=(4,3,2,2,1)$ for a graph on $n=5$ vertices is valid. The sum of degrees must be even, and $\\sum d_i = 4+3+2+2+1=12$, which is even. So, a graph with this degree sequence could exist.\n\nNext, we check if a threshold graph with this degree sequence can be constructed. We need to find a binary creation sequence $S=s_1s_2s_3s_4s_5$ that generates this degree sequence. Let's try to build such a sequence.\nA vertex $v_i$ added with $s_i=1$ connects to all $i-1$ previous vertices. A vertex $v_j$ with $j>i$ and $s_j=1$ will also connect to $v_i$. The degree of a vertex $v_i$ is $\\deg(v_i) = s_i(i-1) + \\sum_{j=i+1}^5 s_j$.\n\nLet's work backward from the highest degree. To get a degree of 4 in a 5-vertex graph, vertex $v_5$ must be a dominating vertex ($s_5=1$), as it's the only one that can connect to 4 prior vertices.\n- If $s_5=1$, then $\\deg(v_5) = 1(5-1) + 0 = 4$. This matches.\n\nNow we have the sequence $s_1s_2s_3s_41$. Let's find a degree of 1.\n- The degree of $v_4$ is $\\deg(v_4) = s_4(3) + s_5 = 3s_4 + 1$. To get a degree of 1, we must have $s_4=0$.\n\nNow we have $s_1s_2s_301$. Let's find a degree of 3.\n- $\\deg(v_3) = s_3(2) + s_4 + s_5 = 2s_3 + 0 + 1 = 2s_3+1$. To get a degree of 3, we must have $s_3=1$.\n\nNow we have $s_1s_2101$. We need two vertices of degree 2.\n- $\\deg(v_2) = s_2(1) + s_3 + s_4 + s_5 = s_2 + 1 + 0 + 1 = s_2+2$. To get degree 2, we need $s_2=0$.\n- $\\deg(v_1) = s_1(0) + s_2+s_3+s_4+s_5 = 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 2$. This gives us the second degree 2 vertex, regardless of $s_1$. Let's set $s_1=0$.\n\nThe creation sequence $S=00101$ yields the degrees:\n- $\\deg(v_1)=0+0+1+0+1=2$\n- $\\deg(v_2)=0(1)+1+0+1=2$\n- $\\deg(v_3)=1(2)+0+1=3$\n- $\\deg(v_4)=0(3)+1=1$\n- $\\deg(v_5)=1(4)=4$\nThe degree multiset is $\\{4, 3, 2, 2, 1\\}$, which matches the given sequence. Thus, a threshold graph with this degree sequence exists.\n\nFinally, we consider uniqueness. It is a known property that a degree sequence corresponds to at most one threshold graph (up to isomorphism). Furthermore, if a degree sequence has a unique realization as a simple graph, and we have shown it can be realized as a threshold graph, then that unique realization must be the threshold graph. In this case, the Havel-Hakimi process on $(4,3,2,2,1)$ confirms it is graphic and leads to a unique residual graph, implying the original graph is uniquely determined by its degree sequence.\n\nTherefore, a threshold graph with this degree sequence exists, and it is the only simple graph with this sequence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1549407"}, {"introduction": "The binary creation sequence provides a blueprint for constructing a threshold graph by sequentially adding vertices.
