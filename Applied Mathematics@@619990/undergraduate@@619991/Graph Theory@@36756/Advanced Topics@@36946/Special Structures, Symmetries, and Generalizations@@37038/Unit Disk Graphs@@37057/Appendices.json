In the unit disk graph $G$, two distinct vertices $(i,j)$ and $(i',j')$ are adjacent if and only if their Euclidean distance satisfies\n$$\n\\sqrt{(i-i')^{2}+(j-j')^{2}}\\leq 1.\n$$\nSince $i,i',j,j'$ are integers between $0$ and $2$, the possible nonzero squared distances between distinct points are $1$ (when $|i-i'|+|j-j'|=1$, i.e., they differ by $1$ in exactly one coordinate) and $2$ (when both coordinates differ by $1$, i.e., diagonal neighbors). The condition $\\sqrt{(i-i')^{2}+(j-j')^{2}}\\leq 1$ includes only the case with squared distance $1$ and excludes the case with squared distance $2$ because $\\sqrt{2}>1$. Therefore, edges exist exactly between horizontal or vertical nearest neighbors, and no diagonal edges exist. Hence $G$ is the $3\\times 3$ grid graph with only orthogonal adjacencies.\n\nTo count edges, observe there are horizontal edges: in each of the $3$ rows, $3$ vertices create $2$ edges, yielding $3\\cdot 2=6$ horizontal edges. Similarly, there are $3$ columns each with $2$ vertical edges, yielding $3\\cdot 2=6$ vertical edges. Thus the total number of edges is $6+6=12$, so statement A (exactly $10$ edges) is false.\n\nFor connectivity, the $3\\times 3$ grid with orthogonal adjacencies forms a single connected component because from any vertex one can reach any other by a sequence of horizontal and vertical steps of length $1$ along existing edges. Therefore, statement B (not connected) is false.\n\nFor bipartiteness, define a $2$-coloring by partitioning $V$ according to the parity of $i+j$: place $(i,j)$ in one part if $i+j$ is even and in the other if $i+j$ is odd. Adjacent vertices differ by $1$ in exactly one coordinate, so $i+j$ changes parity across every edge. Hence no edge is within a part, so $G$ is bipartite. Therefore, statement C is true.\n\nFor vertex degrees, corner vertices (e.g., $(0,0)$) have degree $2$, edge-midpoint vertices (e.g., $(1,0)$) have degree $3$, and the center $(1,1)$ has degree $4$. Thus not every vertex has degree $3$, so statement D is false. Using the handshake lemma as a check: sum of degrees equals $4\\cdot 2+4\\cdot 3+1\\cdot 4=24$, giving $24/2=12$ edges, consistent with the earlier count.\n\nFinally, for triangles, a cycle of length $3$ would require three mutually adjacent vertices. However, since edges only occur between points differing by $1$ in exactly one coordinate, any closed walk that returns to its start must have an even number of steps in each coordinate direction to result in zero net displacement. A $3$-step closed walk cannot satisfy this, so no $3$-cycle exists. Thus statement E is false.\n\nConsequently, the only true statement is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1552583"}, {"introduction": "The structure of a Unit Disk Graph is highly sensitive to the precise geometric placement of its vertices.
