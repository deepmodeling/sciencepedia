Hence any automorphism maps a vertex of degree $d$ to a vertex of degree $d$, and similarly it maps an edge with a given pattern of endpoint degrees to an edge with the same pattern.\n\nFor the path graph $P_{n}$ with $n>3$, the degree sequence has exactly two vertices of degree $1$ (the endpoints) and $n-2$ vertices of degree $2$ (the internal vertices). Since automorphisms preserve degree, any automorphism must map endpoints to endpoints and internal vertices to internal vertices. Therefore, there are at least two distinct vertex orbits under the automorphism group, so $P_{n}$ is not vertex-transitive. For edges, the two end edges each have one endpoint of degree $1$ and one of degree $2$, whereas every internal edge has both endpoints of degree $2$. Because automorphisms preserve the degrees of endpoints, the end edges cannot be mapped to internal edges. Hence $P_{n}$ is not edge-transitive either.\n\nFor the cycle graph $C_{n}$ with $n>3$, every vertex has degree $2$, and every edge is structurally identical up to rotation or reflection. Define, for each $k \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,n-1\\}$, the permutation $\\rho_{k}$ on the vertex set by $\\rho_{k}(v_{i})=v_{i+k}$ where indices are taken modulo $n$.

In particular, all vertices must have the same degree. Since the hub has degree $n$ and a rim vertex has degree $3$, equality of degrees forces $n=3$. When $n=3$, the rim is $C_{3}$, so every pair of rim vertices is adjacent, and together with the three spokes this yields exactly $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ edges; thus $W_{3}$ is isomorphic to $K_{4}$, which is vertex-transitive.

By construction, edges exist exactly between $S$ and $C$, and there are no edges within $S$ or within $C$.\n\nNode-uniformity (vertex-transitivity):\n1) A basic invariant under any graph automorphism is vertex degree. If $\\varphi$ is an automorphism and $u$ a vertex, then $\\deg(u)=\\deg(\\varphi(u))$.\n2) In $K_{m,n}$, for any $s\\in S$, $\\deg(s)=n$, and for any $c\\in C$, $\\deg(c)=m$.\n3) If $m\\neq n$, then vertices in $S$ and $C$ have different degrees. Hence no automorphism can map a vertex in $S$ to a vertex in $C$. Therefore the graph cannot be vertex-transitive, since vertex-transitivity requires that for any $u$ and $v$ (possibly from different parts) there exists an automorphism sending $u$ to $v$. Thus, a necessary condition for vertex-transitivity is $m=n$.\n4) If $m=n$, then all vertices have the same degree $n$. To show sufficiency, construct automorphisms:\n   - For any permutation $\\sigma\\in S_{m}$, extend it to an automorphism of $K_{n,n}$ by permuting vertices within $S$ according to $\\sigma$ and fixing $C$. Similarly, any $\\tau\\in S_{n}$ induces an automorphism by permuting within $C$ and fixing $S$. These act transitively on vertices within each part.\n   - To map across parts, fix a bijection $f:S\\to C$ (possible since $m=n$) and define $\\phi$ by $\\phi(s)=f(s)$ for $s\\in S$ and $\\phi(c)=f^{-1}(c)$ for $c\\in C$. For any edge $\\{s,c\\}$ with $s\\in S$, $c\\in C$, $\\phi(s)\\in C$ and $\\phi(c)\\in S$, and since every pair across parts is adjacent in $K_{n,n}$, adjacency is preserved.
