The connections between nodes can be either one-way (a directed edge or arc) or two-way (an undirected edge). The design must adhere to a strict set of rules for fault tolerance and data flow management.\n\nThe rules are as follows:\n1.  Each server node must have exactly one outgoing directed connection to another server node.\n2.  Each server node must have exactly one incoming directed connection from another server node.\n3.  Each server node must be part of exactly one two-way connection with another server node.\n\nLet the servers be represented by vertices and the connections by edges in a mixed graph.

The connections are represented by a set of directed edges (arcs), $A$, and a set of undirected edges, $E$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the constraints on the directed edges.\n- Rule 1 states that each server must have exactly one outgoing directed connection. In graph theory terms, this means the out-degree of every vertex $v$ is 1, i.e., $deg^+(v) = 1$ for all $v \\in V$.\n- Rule 2 states that each server must have exactly one incoming directed connection. This means the in-degree of every vertex $v$ is 1, i.e., $deg^-(v) = 1$ for all $v \\in V$.\n\nA directed graph where every vertex has an in-degree of 1 and an out-degree of 1 is known to be a disjoint union of directed cycles. Since there are 5 vertices, the only possible configuration for the directed subgraph is a single directed cycle of length 5 (a 5-cycle). This tells us that the directed part of the network is structurally determined.\n\nNext, let's analyze the constraint on the undirected edges.\n- Rule 3 states that each server node must be part of exactly one two-way connection. In graph theory terms, this means the degree of every vertex $v$ in the undirected subgraph is 1. Let $deg(v)$ denote the degree of vertex $v$ from the undirected edges. The rule states $deg(v) = 1$ for all $v \\in V$.\n\nNow, we consider the properties of the undirected subgraph. The handshaking lemma (or degree sum formula) for an undirected graph states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges in the graph.\n$$ \\sum_{v \\in V} deg(v) = 2|E| $$\nAccording to Rule 3, the degree of each of the 5 vertices is 1. So, the sum of the degrees is:\n$$ \\sum_{v \\in V} deg(v) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 $$\nApplying the handshaking lemma, we get the equation:\n$$ 5 = 2|E| $$\nThis equation requires the number of undirected edges, $|E|$, to be $2.5$. However, the number of edges in a graph must be a non-negative integer. It is impossible to have $2.5$ edges. Therefore, there is a contradiction. An undirected graph with 5 vertices cannot have every vertex be of degree 1, because the sum of degrees would be 5, which is an odd number. The sum of degrees in any undirected graph must be even.\n\nSince it is impossible to satisfy Rule 3 for a network of 5 nodes, the entire network structure as described by the three rules is impossible to construct.\n\nLet's briefly evaluate the other options:\n- A: A path graph on 5 vertices has two vertices of degree 1 and three vertices of degree 2. This violates Rule 3.\n- B and E: In these scenarios, one vertex has an undirected degree of 0, which violates Rule 3.\n- D: A perfect matching on a graph is a set of edges where every vertex is an endpoint of exactly one edge. This is only possible if the number of vertices is even. Since we have 5 vertices, a perfect matching is not possible.\n\nThus, the only correct conclusion is that the network is impossible to build.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1522651"}, {"introduction": "Progress in mathematics often involves extending familiar concepts into new, more complex domains.
