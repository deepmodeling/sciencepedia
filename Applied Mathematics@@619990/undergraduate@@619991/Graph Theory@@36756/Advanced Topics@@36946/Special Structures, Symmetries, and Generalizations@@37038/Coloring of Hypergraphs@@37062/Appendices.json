This practice introduces the concept of the 2-section graph, a fundamental tool for translating a hypergraph problem into a more familiar graph theory setting [@problem_id:1490012]. You will see how the structure of the hypergraph—in this case, two overlapping hyperedges—creates cliques in the 2-section graph, allowing you to use classic graph coloring bounds to find the solution.", "problem": "In network science and data analysis, relationships between entities are often more complex than simple pairwise connections. A hypergraph is a generalization of a graph that allows an \"edge\" to connect any number of \"vertices.\" Formally, a hypergraph $H$ is a pair $(V, E)$, where $V$ is a set of vertices, and $E$ is a set of hyperedges, with each hyperedge being a non-empty subset of $V$.\n\nFrom any hypergraph $H$, we can derive a standard graph called its 2-section graph, denoted $G_H$. The vertex set of $G_H$ is the same as the vertex set of $H$. An edge exists between two distinct vertices $\\{u, v\\}$ in $G_H$ if and only if there is at least one hyperedge in $H$ that contains both $u$ and $v$.\n\nA proper coloring of a graph assigns a color to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The chromatic number of a graph, denoted $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors required for a proper coloring.\n\nConsider a simple hypergraph $H = (V, E)$ consisting of exactly two hyperedges, $E_1$ and $E_2$. The cardinalities of these hyperedges are $|E_1| = 5$ and $|E_2| = 7$. The hyperedges have exactly two vertices in common, i.e., $|E_1 \\cap E_2| = 2$.\n\nCalculate the chromatic number of the 2-section graph $G_H$ derived from this hypergraph $H$.", "solution": "Let the hypergraph be $H=(V, E)$ with $E = \\{E_1, E_2\\}$.\nWe are given the sizes of the hyperedges: $|E_1| = 5$ and $|E_2| = 7$.\nWe are also given that their intersection has size 2: $|E_1 \\cap E_2| = 2$.\n\nThe problem asks for the chromatic number, $\\chi(G_H)$, of the 2-section graph $G_H$.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the 2-section graph $G_H$.\nThe vertex set of $G_H$ is the same as the vertex set of $H$, which is $V = E_1 \\cup E_2$. The total number of vertices is $|V| = |E_1| + |E_2| - |E_1 \\cap E_2| = 5 + 7 - 2 = 10$.\nThe edges of $G_H$ are defined as follows: two vertices $u, v \\in V$ are adjacent in $G_H$ if they both belong to $E_1$ or they both belong to $E_2$.\n\nLet's analyze the subgraph of $G_H$ induced by the vertices of $E_1$. By definition of the 2-section graph, any two vertices in $E_1$ are connected by an edge because they are all in the same hyperedge $E_1$. A graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge is a clique. Therefore, the vertices of $E_1$ form a clique of size $|E_1|=5$, which we denote as $K_5$.\n\nSimilarly, the vertices of $E_2$ induce a clique of size $|E_2|=7$ in $G_H$, which we denote as $K_7$.\n\nThe graph $G_H$ is the union of these two cliques, which share the $|E_1 \\cap E_2| = 2$ common vertices.\n\nTo find the chromatic number $\\chi(G_H)$, we can establish a lower and an upper bound.\n\nA fundamental property of graph coloring is that the chromatic number of any graph $G$ must be greater than or equal to the size of its largest clique (the clique number, $\\omega(G)$). This is because all vertices in a clique are mutually adjacent, so they must all be assigned distinct colors.\n$$ \\chi(G) \\ge \\omega(G) $$\nIn our graph $G_H$, we have a clique of size 7 (the one induced by $E_2$). Thus, the clique number of $G_H$ is at least 7. It is in fact exactly 7, as any clique larger than 7 would need vertices from outside $E_2$, but those vertices are not all mutually connected to all vertices in $E_2$. The largest clique is the larger of the two initial cliques, so $\\omega(G_H) = \\max(|E_1|, |E_2|) = \\max(5, 7) = 7$.\nTherefore, we have a lower bound for the chromatic number:\n$$ \\chi(G_H) \\ge 7 $$\n\nNow, let's determine if we can properly color $G_H$ with 7 colors. If we can find a valid 7-coloring, then we can conclude that the chromatic number is exactly 7.\n\nLet the 7 colors be $\\{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5, c_6, c_7\\}$.\nThe graph $G_H$ contains a $K_7$ subgraph on the vertex set $E_2$. Let's start by coloring these 7 vertices. Since they are all mutually adjacent, they require 7 distinct colors. Let's assign each vertex in $E_2$ a unique color from our palette of 7 colors.\nLet $E_1 \\cap E_2 = \\{v_1, v_2\\}$. These two vertices are part of $E_2$, so they have already been assigned two distinct colors. Let's say $c(v_1) = c_1$ and $c(v_2) = c_2$.\n\nNow, we need to color the remaining vertices. The vertices that have not yet been colored are those in $E_1$ but not in $E_2$. Let this set be $E_1' = E_1 \\setminus E_2$. The number of such vertices is $|E_1'| = |E_1| - |E_1 \\cap E_2| = 5 - 2 = 3$.\nLet $E_1' = \\{u_1, u_2, u_3\\}$.\n\nThese three vertices, along with $v_1$ and $v_2$, form the $K_5$ clique on the vertex set $E_1$. So, each of $u_1, u_2, u_3$ is adjacent to $v_1$ and $v_2$, and they are all adjacent to each other.\nFor a proper coloring, the color for any vertex $u_i \\in E_1'$ must be different from the colors of all its neighbors.\nThe neighbors of $u_1$ include $v_1, v_2, u_2, u_3$.\nThis means:\n1. $c(u_1), c(u_2), c(u_3)$ must all be distinct.\n2. Each of these colors must be different from $c(v_1)=c_1$ and $c(v_2)=c_2$.\n\nSo we need to find 3 distinct colors for $\\{u_1, u_2, u_3\\}$ from the palette $\\{c_1, \\dots, c_7\\}$, excluding $c_1$ and $c_2$. The available colors are $\\{c_3, c_4, c_5, c_6, c_7\\}$. We have 5 colors available, and we only need to choose 3 of them. This is possible. For example, we can set $c(u_1) = c_3$, $c(u_2) = c_4$, and $c(u_3) = c_5$.\n\nWith this assignment, all vertices in the graph have been colored. The subgraph on $E_2$ is properly colored because its 7 vertices have 7 distinct colors. The subgraph on $E_1$ is properly colored because its 5 vertices ($v_1, v_2, u_1, u_2, u_3$) have been assigned the colors $\\{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5\\}$, which are 5 distinct colors. Since the entire graph $G_H$ is the union of these two cliques, the coloring is proper for all of $G_H$.\n\nWe have successfully constructed a proper coloring of $G_H$ using 7 colors. This establishes an upper bound:\n$$ \\chi(G_H) \\le 7 $$\n\nCombining the lower and upper bounds, we have $\\chi(G_H) \\ge 7$ and $\\chi(G_H) \\le 7$.\nTherefore, the chromatic number of the 2-section graph $G_H$ is exactly 7.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7}$$", "id": "1490012"}]}
