The intersection graph for this set of squares is a graph where each square corresponds to a vertex, and an edge exists between two vertices if and only if their corresponding squares have a non-empty intersection. An intersection can be an area or just a shared boundary point.\n\nSuppose the arrangement of these five squares is such that their intersection graph is isomorphic to the path graph $P_5$.
