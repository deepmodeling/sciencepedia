The graph $K_{2,3}$ is not a circular-arc graph, because any bipartite graph containing a cycle is not a circular-arc graph.\nD. The graph $K_{2,3}$ is not a circular-arc graph, because placing the two disjoint arcs for the vertices in $U$ on a circle creates only two disjoint gaps, which is insufficient to place the three required, mutually disjoint arcs for the vertices in $V$ such that they each intersect both arcs from $U$.", "solution": "We model a circular-arc representation as follows. For each vertex $x$, let $I_{x}$ denote its corresponding arc on a circle.

Since $I_{u_{1}}$ and $I_{u_{2}}$ are disjoint, $I$ must have one endpoint in $I_{u_{1}}$ and the other endpoint in $I_{u_{2}}$. Traversing the circle from the endpoint in $I_{u_{1}}$ to the endpoint in $I_{u_{2}}$ yields exactly two possible circular subarcs; each route necessarily passes through exactly one of the two gaps, and along that chosen route $I$ contains the entire corresponding gap. Therefore, for such an $I$,\n$$\n\\text{either } G_{1} \\subseteq I \\quad\\text{or}\\quad G_{2} \\subseteq I.\n$$\nConsequently, if two arcs $I$ and $J$ both intersect $I_{u_{1}}$ and $I_{u_{2}}$ and use the same gap $G_{k}$, then\n$$\nI \\cap J \\supseteq G_{k} \\neq \\varnothing,\n$$\nso $I$ and $J$ intersect. Hence, among arcs that each intersect both $I_{u_{1}}$ and $I_{u_{2}}$ and are pairwise disjoint, at most one can use $G_{1}$ and at most one can use $G_{2}$.

Yes, $\\bar{C_6}$ is a circular-arc graph. This is because $\\bar{C_6}$ is isomorphic to the disjoint union of two 3-vertex cliques ($2K_3$). Any graph consisting of disjoint cliques is an interval graph, and every interval graph is a circular-arc graph.\nB. Yes, $\\bar{C_6}$ is a circular-arc graph. While it can be shown that $\\bar{C_6}$ is not an interval graph, the class of circular-arc graphs is broader, and it is a general property that the complement of any cycle graph $C_n$ is a circular-arc graph.\nC. No, $\\bar{C_6}$ is not a circular-arc graph. The graph $\\bar{C_6}$ contains an induced 4-cycle. Graphs that contain induced cycles of length greater than 3 are not chordal. Since circular-arc graphs must be chordal, $\\bar{C_6}$ cannot be a circular-arc graph.\nD. No, $\\bar{C_6}$ is not a circular-arc graph. The edges of the original $C_6$ graph correspond to pairs of vertices that are non-adjacent in $\\bar{C_6}$. This cycle of six non-adjacencies ($v_1 \\not\\leftrightarrow v_2 \\not\\leftrightarrow \\dots \\not\\leftrightarrow v_6 \\not\\leftrightarrow v_1$) forces the corresponding six arcs in any potential circular-arc representation to be placed in a sequential, non-overlapping order around the circle.

Although $\\bar{C_6}$ contains an induced $4$-cycle, circular-arc graphs are not required to be chordal. A basic counterexample is $C_4$ itself, which is a circular-arc graph but is not chordal.\n\nThird, option B asserts a general property that the complement of any cycle $C_{n}$ is circular-arc. This is not a valid justification. In particular, we will show directly that $\\bar{C_6}$ cannot be a circular-arc graph, contradicting the asserted general property.\n\nWe now prove that $\\bar{C_6}$ is not a circular-arc graph. Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists a circular-arc representation with arcs $A_{i}$ corresponding to $v_{i}$. In such a representation, two vertices are adjacent if and only if the corresponding arcs intersect, and they are non-adjacent if and only if the arcs are disjoint.\n\nFrom the adjacency in $C_6$, the pairs $\\{(v_{1},v_{2}),(v_{2},v_{3}),(v_{3},v_{4}),(v_{4},v_{5}),(v_{5},v_{6}),(v_{6},v_{1})\\}$ are edges of $C_6$, hence these pairs are non-edges of $\\bar{C_6}$ and therefore the corresponding arc pairs $\\{(A_{1},A_{2}),(A_{2},A_{3}),(A_{3},A_{4}),(A_{4},A_{5}),(A_{5},A_{6}),(A_{6},A_{1})\\}$ are disjoint. Consider the circle with a fixed orientation, and let the endpoints of $A_{i}$ be $a_{i}^{-}$ and $a_{i}^{+}$ in the circular order so that $A_{i}$ is the subarc from $a_{i}^{-}$ to $a_{i}^{+}$.\n\nBecause $A_{1}$ is disjoint from $A_{2}$ and $A_{6}$, the two endpoints $a_{1}^{-},a_{1}^{+}$ must lie in the same connected component of the circle with $A_{2}\\cup A_{6}$ removed. Equivalently, in the circular order of endpoints, the pair $\\{a_{1}^{-},a_{1}^{+}\\}$ must appear consecutively with no endpoint of $A_{2}$ or $A_{6}$ in between; in particular, the endpoints of $A_{2}$ must both lie outside $A_{1}$. Applying the same reasoning to each disjoint pair $(A_{i},A_{i+1})$ shows inductively that the endpoints occur in the circular sequence\n$$\na_{1}^{-},\\,a_{1}^{+},\\,a_{2}^{-},\\,a_{2}^{+},\\,a_{3}^{-},\\,a_{3}^{+},\\,a_{4}^{-},\\,a_{4}^{+},\\,a_{5}^{-},\\,a_{5}^{+},\\,a_{6}^{-},\\,a_{6}^{+}\n$$\nup to rotation, so that each consecutive pair of arcs $A_{i}$ and $A_{i+1}$ occupy disjoint consecutive segments around the circle.\n\nNow examine $A_{1}$ and $A_{3}$. In the above order, $A_{2}$ separates $A_{1}$ from $A_{3}$: any subarc that starts in $A_{1}$ and tries to reach the segment of $A_{3}$ must pass through the segment occupied by $A_{2}$. Since $A_{2}$ is disjoint from both $A_{1}$ and $A_{3}$, this prevents $A_{1}$ and $A_{3}$ from intersecting. But in $\\bar{C_6}$, $v_{1}$ and $v_{3}$ are adjacent, so $A_{1}$ and $A_{3}$ must intersect. This is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, no circular-arc representation of $\\bar{C_6}$ exists, and $\\bar{C_6}$ is not a circular-arc graph. Among the options, D accurately captures this obstruction: the pattern of six non-adjacencies forces a circular placement that precludes the required intersection between $A_{1}$ and $A_{3}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1488352"}]}
