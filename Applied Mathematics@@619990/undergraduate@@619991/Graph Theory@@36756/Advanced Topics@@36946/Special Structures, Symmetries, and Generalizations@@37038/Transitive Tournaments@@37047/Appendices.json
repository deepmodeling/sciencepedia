A tournament graph on $n$ vertices (representing $n$ players) is a directed graph where for every pair of distinct vertices $u$ and $v$, exactly one of the directed edges $(u, v)$ or $(v, u)$ exists. An edge $(u, v)$ signifies that player $u$ defeated player $v$.\n\nA tournament is said to be transitive if it represents a consistent, linear ranking of all players. Formally, a tournament is transitive if for any three distinct vertices $u, v, w$, the existence of edges $(u, v)$ and $(v, w)$ implies the existence of the edge $(u, w)$. In other words, if player $u$ beats player $v$, and player $v$ beats player $w$, then for the ranking to be consistent, player $u$ must also beat player $w$.\n\nConsider four different tournaments, each with four players labeled $\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.

Because $T$ is transitive, if $u \\prec v$ and $v \\prec w$, then $(u,w) \\in E$, so $u \\prec w$ (transitivity). The relation is irreflexive since there are no loops. Hence $\\prec$ is a strict total order on $V$.\n\nLet $H=T[S]$ be any non-empty induced subgraph on $S \\subseteq V$. The restriction of $\\prec$ to $S$ is again a strict total order on $S$, since for any distinct $u,v \\in S$ exactly one of $(u,v)$ or $(v,u)$ lies in $E$ and thus in $E(H)$, and transitivity on triples in $S$ is inherited from $T$.\n\nLet $m \\in S$ be the unique minimal element under $\\prec$ restricted to $S$.

Uniqueness: if $x \\in S$, $x \\neq m$, then either $x \\prec m$ or $m \\prec x$.

For every $v \\in S \\setminus \\{M\\}$, we have $v \\prec M$, hence $(v,M) \\in E(H)$, so $M$ has out-degree zero in $H$. Thus $M$ is a sink. Uniqueness follows analogously: any other $y \\neq M$ satisfies either $y \\prec M$ (implying an edge into $M$) or $M \\prec y$ (contradicting maximality), and in the first case $y$ has an outgoing edge to $M$, so it is not a sink.\n\nIn the case $|S|=1$, the single vertex is both minimal and maximal, hence simultaneously a unique source and a unique sink.
