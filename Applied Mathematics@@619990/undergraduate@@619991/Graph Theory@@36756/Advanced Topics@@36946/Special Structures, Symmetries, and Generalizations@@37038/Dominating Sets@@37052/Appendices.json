The tunnel is a single, straight passage that has been divided into $n=2024$ consecutive segments of equal length, numbered sequentially from 1 to 2024.\n\nFor emergency situations, a series of powerful broadcast speakers must be installed. A speaker placed in any given segment $i$ (where $1 \\le i \\le n$) provides clear audio coverage to segment $i$ itself. Due to the acoustics of the tunnel, the signal also clearly reaches the immediately preceding segment $i-1$ (if $i>1$) and the immediately succeeding segment $i+1$ (if $i<n$).\n\nThe design objective is to ensure that every single segment along the entire length of the tunnel receives audio coverage from at least one speaker. Your task is to determine the absolute minimum number of speakers required to achieve this goal.", "solution": "Let $n$ denote the number of tunnel segments and let $s$ denote the minimum number of speakers needed so that every segment is covered. A speaker placed at segment $i$ covers at most the three segments $\\{i-1,i,i+1\\}$ (with fewer only at the ends). Therefore, any set of $s$ speakers can cover at most $3s$ segments in total. To cover all $n$ segments, it is necessary that\n$$\n3s \\geq n \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad s \\geq \\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{3} \\right\\rceil.\n$$\nThis gives a universal lower bound $s \\geq \\lceil n/3 \\rceil$.\n\nWe now show that this bound is achievable, hence optimal, by an explicit construction. Use a left-to-right greedy placement: place a speaker at segment $2$, which covers segments $1,2,3$; then place the next at segment $5$, covering $4,5,6$; and continue placing at every third segment thereafter. Concretely, for $n=3k$, place speakers at segments $2,5,\\dots,3k-1$; there are $k$ speakers and they cover all $3k$ segments. For $n=3k+1$, after covering up to segment $3k$ with $k$ speakers at $2,5,\\dots,3k-1$, place one additional speaker at segment $3k+1$ to cover the remaining segment; this uses $k+1=\\lceil (3k+1)/3 \\rceil$ speakers. For $n=3k+2$, after covering up to segment $3k$, place one additional speaker at segment $3k+1$; this covers segments $3k+1$ and $3k+2$, using $k+1=\\lceil (3k+2)/3 \\rceil$ speakers. In all cases, the construction uses exactly $\\lceil n/3 \\rceil$ speakers, matching the lower bound.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of speakers required for $n$ segments is $s_{\\min}=\\lceil n/3 \\rceil$.

For any two vertices $x,y$, the union $N[x]\\cup N[y]$ misses at least one of the vertices in $\\{3,5,8\\}$ together with its partner, as can be checked directly or by observing that none of the closed neighborhoods contains more than one among $\\{3,5,8\\}$. Therefore $\\gamma(G)\\ge 3$.\n\nNext, a dominating set of size $3$ exists. For example, let $D=\\{1,4,6\\}$.
