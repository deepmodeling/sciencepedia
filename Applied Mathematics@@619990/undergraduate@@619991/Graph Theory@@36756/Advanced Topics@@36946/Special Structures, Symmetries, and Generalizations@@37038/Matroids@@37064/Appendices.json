{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The rank of a set of elements is one of the most fundamental properties of a matroid, measuring the size of the largest independent subset it contains. In the context of a graphic matroid, the rank of a set of edges has an intuitive geometric meaning related to the structure of the corresponding subgraph. This exercise will help you master the calculation of rank in a graphic matroid by directly applying the formula $r(X) = |V| - c(V,X)$, where $|V|$ is the number of vertices in the graph and $c(V,X)$ is the number of connected components in the subgraph formed by the edge set $X$ [@problem_id:1520917].", "problem": "Consider a graph $G$ known as the 5-rung ladder graph. The vertex set of $G$ is given by $V = \\{u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4, u_5\\} \\cup \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5\\}$. The edge set $E$ of $G$ consists of the following three types of edges:\n1.  A set of 'top rail' edges, $E_{top} = \\{\\{u_i, u_{i+1}\\} \\mid i=1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n2.  A set of 'bottom rail' edges, $E_{bot} = \\{\\{v_i, v_{i+1}\\} \\mid i=1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n3.

We are interested in the rank of a specific subset of these edges. Let the set $S$ be defined as the union of all five rung edges and the first edge from each of the top and bottom rails.

The classic problem of finding a minimum or maximum weight spanning tree in a graph is the canonical example of this powerful principle in action. This hands-on practice guides you through Kruskal's algorithm, allowing you to see firsthand how the greedy choice at each step builds toward a provably optimal network design [@problem_id:1542076].", "problem": "A network architect is designing the backbone of a small, specialized computing cluster. The cluster consists of six server nodes, labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F. A set of potential high-bandwidth fiber optic links can be installed between certain pairs of nodes. The available links and their corresponding maximum data transfer rates (bandwidths) are listed below:\n\n- Link (A, B): 15 Gbps\n- Link (A, C): 5 Gbps\n- Link (A, F): 8 Gbps\n- Link (B, C): 10 Gbps\n- Link (B, D): 12 Gbps\n- Link (C, D): 4 Gbps\n- Link (C, E): 9 Gbps\n- Link (D, E): 14 Gbps\n- Link (E, F): 7 Gbps\n\nThe final network design requires that a subset of these links be activated. The chosen set of active links must satisfy two conditions: First, all six nodes must be connected, meaning it must be possible to send data between any two nodes by traversing a path of active links. Second, the network must contain no redundant paths or loops; that is, there must be exactly one unique path between any two nodes. The objective is to select the active links in such a way that the sum of their individual bandwidths is maximized.\n\nWhat is the maximum possible total bandwidth of the active links in the final network design? Express your answer in Gbps.", "solution": "The requirements “all nodes connected” and “no cycles” mean the active links must form a spanning tree on the six nodes. With six nodes, any spanning tree has exactly $6-1=5$ edges. To maximize the total bandwidth of the active links subject to this tree constraint, we must find a maximum-weight spanning tree. Using Kruskal’s algorithm adapted for maximum weight, we sort the links by decreasing bandwidth and insert them one by one, skipping any link that would create a cycle, until we have $5$ edges.\n\nOrder the links by bandwidth (from largest to smallest): $(A,B):15$, $(D,E):14$, $(B,D):12$, $(B,C):10$, $(C,E):9$, $(A,F):8$, $(E,F):7$, $(A,C):5$, $(C,D):4$. Start with no edges. Add $(A,B)$ to connect $A$ and $B$. Add $(D,E)$ to connect $D$ and $E$. Add $(B,D)$, which merges the components $\\{A,B\\}$ and $\\{D,E\\}$ into $\\{A,B,D,E\\}$ without forming a cycle. Add $(B,C)$ to include $C$, yielding the component $\\{A,B,C,D,E\\}$. The next candidate $(C,E)$ would create a cycle because $C$ and $E$ are already connected via the existing path $C$–$B$–$D$–$E$, so we skip it. The next candidate $(A,F)$ connects $F$ to the existing component without forming a cycle. At this point we have selected $5$ edges, so the spanning tree is complete. The selected edges are $(A,B)$, $(D,E)$, $(B,D)$, $(B,C)$, and $(A,F)$ with total bandwidth\n$$15+14+12+10+8=59.$$\n\nBy the cut optimality property underlying Kruskal’s algorithm, this construction yields a maximum-weight spanning tree. As an independent check, note that the five largest bandwidths are $15$, $14$, $12$, $10$, and $9$, but the corresponding edges contain a cycle, so at least one must be replaced by the next largest feasible edge $8$, giving an upper bound of $59$, which is achieved by the tree above. Therefore, the maximum possible total bandwidth is $59$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{59}$$", "id": "1542076"}, {"introduction": "Duality is a profound concept in mathematics where objects or properties exist in complementary pairs. In matroid theory, every matroid $M$ has a unique dual matroid $M^*$, whose structure is intrinsically linked to that of $M$. This exercise provides a concrete introduction to this concept by exploring the simple but elegant relationship between the bases of a matroid and its dual: the bases of $M^*$ are the complements of the bases of $M$. By working with a small, easy-to-visualize graph, you can build a solid intuition for this fundamental construction [@problem_id:1509135].", "problem": "Consider a simple transportation network consisting of three hubs, labeled H1, H2, and H3.

The set of all links is $E = \\{l_{12}, l_{23}, l_{13}\\}$.\n\nThe network's structure can be described by a graphic matroid, $M$, on the ground set $E$. In this matroid, a set of links is independent if it does not contain a cycle. A basis of the matroid $M$ is a maximal independent set of links.\n\nThe dual matroid, denoted $M^*$, is another matroid on the same ground set $E$. A defining property of the dual matroid is that its bases are the complements of the bases of the original matroid $M$.

For the graphic matroid $M$ of a connected graph, the rank is $r(M)=|V|-1=3-1=2$. Independent sets are acyclic edge sets; in a triangle, any two-edge set is acyclic, while the three-edge set forms a cycle. Therefore, the bases of $M$ are precisely the two-edge subsets:\n$$\n\\{l_{12},l_{23}\\},\\quad \\{l_{23},l_{13}\\},\\quad \\{l_{12},l_{13}\\}.\n$$\nBy the defining property of duality, the bases of the dual matroid $M^{*}$ are the complements in $E$ of the bases of $M$.
