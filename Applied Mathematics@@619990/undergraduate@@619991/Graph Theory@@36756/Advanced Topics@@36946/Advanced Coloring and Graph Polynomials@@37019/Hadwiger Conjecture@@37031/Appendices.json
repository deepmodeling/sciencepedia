This problem explores the relationship between two such invariants: the chromatic number and the Hadwiger number.\n\nFirst, let's establish the necessary definitions. A **simple graph** is an undirected graph with no loops (edges from a vertex to itself) and no more than one edge between any two distinct vertices.\n\nA **k-coloring** of a graph $G$ is an assignment of one of $k$ colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color. The **chromatic number** of $G$, denoted $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum integer $k$ for which a k-coloring of $G$ exists. A graph is called **bipartite** if its vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets, $U$ and $V$, such that every edge connects a vertex in $U$ to one in $V$.\n\nThe concept of a graph minor is defined through edge contraction. An **edge contraction** on an edge $\\{u, v\\}$ in a graph $G$ creates a new graph $G'$ where the vertices $u$ and $v$ are merged into a new single vertex $w$. This new vertex $w$ is adjacent to every vertex that was adjacent to either $u$ or $v$ (excluding $u$ and $v$ themselves). A graph $H$ is a **minor** of a graph $G$ if $H$ can be obtained from a subgraph of $G$ by performing a sequence of zero or more edge contractions.\n\nThe **Hadwiger number** of a graph $G$, denoted $h(G)$, is the size of the largest complete graph $K_k$ that is a minor of $G$. In other words, $h(G)$ is the maximum integer $k$ such that $K_k$ is a minor of $G$.\n\nNow, consider the **complete bipartite graph** $K_{3,3}$.
