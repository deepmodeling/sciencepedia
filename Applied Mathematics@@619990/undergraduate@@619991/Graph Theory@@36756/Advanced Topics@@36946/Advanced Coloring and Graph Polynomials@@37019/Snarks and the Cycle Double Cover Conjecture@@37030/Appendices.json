This final practice [@problem_id:1533405] delves into what makes a snark \"reducible\" by examining the role of small cycles. By analyzing the coloring constraints imposed by a 4-cycle, you will understand the reasoning behind a key requirement for nontrivial snarks: they must have a girth of at least 5, a fundamental structural property that helps researchers focus their search for counterexamples.", "problem": "In graph theory, a *snark* is a connected, bridgeless, cubic graph that has a chromatic index of 4. The chromatic index is the minimum number of colors required for an edge coloring, where no two adjacent edges have the same color. A graph is *cubic* if every vertex has a degree of 3. A graph is *bridgeless* if the removal of any single edge does not disconnect the graph.\n\nSnarks can be seen as the fundamental obstacles to 3-edge-coloring cubic graphs. For this reason, researchers are particularly interested in *nontrivial* snarks, which are snarks that are irreducible, meaning they do not contain simpler substructures that would make them \"trivially\" non-3-edge-colorable.\n\nFor example, consider a bridgeless cubic graph $G$ that contains a triangle (a 3-cycle). It can be proven that $G$ has a chromatic index of 3 if and only if the smaller cubic graph $G'$, formed by contracting the triangle into a single vertex, also has a chromatic index of 3. This means that if $G$ were a snark (chromatic index 4), it would imply the existence of a smaller snark $G'$. Consequently, any snark containing a triangle is considered \"trivial\" or reducible. This is why nontrivial snarks are required to have a *girth* (the length of the shortest cycle) of at least 4.\n\nNow, let's extend this reasoning. Consider a bridgeless cubic graph $H$ with a girth of exactly 4. Let one of its 4-cycles be $C_4$, with vertices $u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4$ in sequential order. Since $H$ is cubic and has no 3-cycles, there is a single edge leaving each vertex of the $C_4$ to the rest of the graph. Let's call these outgoing edges $e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4$, corresponding to vertices $u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4$.\n\nSuppose we attempt to 3-edge-color $H$ with colors {red, blue, green}. One possible way to color the edges of the 4-cycle is to use alternating colors, for instance, coloring edges $(u_1, u_2)$ and $(u_3, u_4)$ red, and edges $(u_2, u_3)$ and $(u_4, u_1)$ blue. This specific coloring of the cycle's edges imposes a strict condition on the colors of the four 'outgoing' edges $e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4$.\n\nBased on this observation, which of the following statements best explains why a cubic graph containing a 4-cycle is also considered reducible, and therefore not a nontrivial snark?\n\nA. The alternating coloring of the 4-cycle forces all outgoing edges to have the same color (green). This is a contradiction because it is impossible to color a graph where four edges originating from a small structure must have the same color. Thus, any such graph is a snark.\nB. The constraint that all outgoing edges must have the same color (green) simplifies the problem so much that a valid 3-edge-coloring is always guaranteed to exist. Therefore, no graph with a 4-cycle can be a snark.\nC. This constraint allows the coloring problem on $H$ to be related to coloring problems on one or more graphs that are strictly smaller than $H$. Thus, if $H$ were a snark, it would imply the existence of a smaller snark, meaning $H$ is not minimal.\nD. The alternating coloring of the 4-cycle is too restrictive. Other colorings of the cycle must be considered, such as using all three colors on the cycle's edges. These other colorings lead to unpredictable constraints on the outgoing edges, preventing any systematic reduction.\nE. The presence of a 4-cycle in a bridgeless cubic graph implies that the graph must have the Petersen graph as a minor. Since the Petersen graph is a known minimal snark, any other graph containing it as a minor is by definition non-minimal.", "solution": "The goal is to understand why a cubic graph containing a 4-cycle is not considered a *minimal* (or *nontrivial*) snark. The logic mirrors the reason for excluding triangles: the presence of such a substructure allows the edge-coloring problem to be reduced to that of a smaller graph.\n\nLet's first analyze the coloring scenario described in the problem. We have a 4-cycle $C_4 = u_1-u_2-u_3-u_4-u_1$ in a cubic graph $H$. We use three colors: {red, blue, green}.\nThe edges of the cycle are colored with alternating colors:\n- Edge $(u_1, u_2)$ is red.\n- Edge $(u_2, u_3)$ is blue.\n- Edge $(u_3, u_4)$ is red.\n- Edge $(u_4, u_1)$ is blue.\n\nThis is a valid partial coloring. Now, we examine the constraints on the outgoing edges $e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4$.\n- At vertex $u_1$, the two incident cycle edges are red and blue. Since the vertex must have three incident edges of distinct colors, the outgoing edge $e_1$ must be green.\n- At vertex $u_2$, the two incident cycle edges are red and blue. Therefore, the outgoing edge $e_2$ must be green.\n- At vertex $u_3$, the two incident cycle edges are blue and red. Therefore, the outgoing edge $e_3$ must be green.\n- At vertex $u_4$, the two incident cycle edges are blue and red. Therefore, the outgoing edge $e_4$ must be green.\n\nSo, this specific coloring of the 4-cycle forces all four outgoing edges to have the same color (green). This is a very strong constraint. The core of the problem is to understand the implication of this constraint. Let's evaluate the given options.\n\n**Option A is incorrect.** It correctly states that the outgoing edges must all be green but draws the wrong conclusions. It is not necessarily \"impossible\" to color a graph with this constraint. If the four endpoints of $e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4$ are distinct and not adjacent to each other, there is no immediate contradiction. Furthermore, concluding that *any* such graph is a snark is false. For example, the cube graph has girth 4, is cubic and bridgeless, but it is 3-edge-colorable (chromatic index 3), so it is not a snark.\n\n**Option B is incorrect.** It claims that this constraint guarantees a 3-edge-coloring always exists. This is also false. There exist snarks with girth 4 (e.g., Isaacs flower snarks like $J_5$). These graphs are not 3-edge-colorable, demonstrating that the presence of a 4-cycle does not guarantee 3-colorability.\n\n**Option C is correct.** This statement captures the essence of reducibility. The fact that the coloring problem of the large graph $H$ can be tied to the coloring of smaller graphs is the key. If a 3-edge-coloring for $H$ exists, it must satisfy the coloring constraints imposed by the 4-cycle. The analysis of these constraints leads to equivalent coloring problems on graphs smaller than $H$. A full proof shows that $H$ is 3-edge-colorable if and only if at least one of two specific smaller graphs is 3-edge-colorable. This means that if $H$ is *not* 3-edge-colorable (i.e., it's a snark), then both of those smaller graphs must also not be 3-edge-colorable. This would imply the existence of a smaller snark. Therefore, any snark $H$ containing a 4-cycle is \"reducible\" to a smaller snark and is not considered minimal or nontrivial. This is the precise reason why nontrivial snarks are often defined to have a girth of at least 5.\n\n**Option D is incorrect.** While it is true that other colorings of the 4-cycle exist (e.g., using three colors, like red-blue-green-blue), the reduction argument does not require analyzing all of them at once. The argument is that the colorability of the whole graph is determined by the colorability properties of the sub-problems derived from *all* possible local colorings. The alternating 2-coloring is one such case, and it alone is sufficient to build a reduction argument (as sketched in the analysis of option C). The existence of a systematic reduction is precisely what makes these graphs non-minimal snarks.\n\n**Option E is incorrect.** This is a factually false statement. While the Petersen graph is a famous minimal snark (with girth 5), not all bridgeless cubic graphs with a 4-cycle contain it as a minor. Moreover, there are infinitely many distinct nontrivial snarks, so the Petersen graph is not the only one.\n\nTherefore, the correct explanation is that the presence of a 4-cycle allows the problem to be reduced to one or more smaller graphs, making any snark with a 4-cycle non-minimal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1533405"}]}
