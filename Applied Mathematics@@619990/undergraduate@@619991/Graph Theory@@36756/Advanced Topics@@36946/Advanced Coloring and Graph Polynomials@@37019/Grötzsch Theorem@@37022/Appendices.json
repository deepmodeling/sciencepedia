By Kuratowski's theorem, a graph is planar if and only if it contains no subdivision of $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$; since $K_{3,3}$ itself is a Kuratowski obstruction, it is nonplanar.

This is the correct reason.\n\nThe other options are incorrect: $K_{3,3}$ does not contain triangles (so A is false), its chromatic number is actually $2$ because it is bipartite (so B is false), Grötzsch's theorem yields an upper bound of $3$ for graphs satisfying its hypotheses (so D is false), and the theorem imposes no condition about having a minimum number of edges (so E is false).
