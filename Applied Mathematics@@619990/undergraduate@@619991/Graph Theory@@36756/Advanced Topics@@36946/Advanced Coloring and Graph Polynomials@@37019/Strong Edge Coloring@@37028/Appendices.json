A particularly stringent requirement is 'strong' separation. A **strong edge coloring** of a graph is an assignment of colors to its edges such that any two distinct edges receive different colors if they meet at a common vertex, or if they are connected to vertices that are themselves connected by an edge. More formally, two edges $(u,v)$ and $(x,y)$ must have different colors if they share a vertex (i.e., $\\{u,v\\} \\cap \\{x,y\\} \\neq \\emptyset$) or if any vertex of the first edge is adjacent to any vertex of the second edge (meaning an edge exists between a vertex in $\\{u,v\\}$ and a vertex in $\\{x,y\\}$).\n\nConsider the 'Friendship Graph' $F_3$. This graph is constructed from three separate triangles, where all three triangles share exactly one common vertex, and are otherwise disjoint.\n\nWhat is the strong chromatic index of the Friendship Graph $F_3$? The strong chromatic index is defined as the minimum number of colors needed for a strong edge coloring.", "solution": "Let $F_{3}$ have vertex set $V=\\{c,a_{1},b_{1},a_{2},b_{2},a_{3},b_{3}\\}$, where for each $i\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$ the triangle uses vertices $\\{c,a_{i},b_{i}\\}$. The edge set is\n$$\nE(F_{3})=\\{ca_{i},cb_{i},a_{i}b_{i}: i=1,2,3\\},\n$$\nso $|E(F_{3})|=9$. Partition $E(F_{3})$ into the six “spoke” edges $S=\\{ca_{1},cb_{1},ca_{2},cb_{2},ca_{3},cb_{3}\\}$ and the three “rim” edges $R=\\{a_{1}b_{1},a_{2}b_{2},a_{3}b_{3}\\}$.\n\nBy the definition of strong edge coloring, two edges must receive different colors if they share a vertex or if any endpoint of one is adjacent to any endpoint of the other.\n\nLower bound:\n1) All edges in $S$ are mutually incident at $c$, so they must all receive distinct colors. Hence at least $6$ colors are required.\n2) Fix any rim edge $a_{i}b_{i}\\in R$ and any spoke edge $cx\\in S$. Since $c$ is adjacent to both $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$, there is an adjacency between an endpoint of $cx$ (namely $c$) and an endpoint of $a_{i}b_{i}$ (namely $a_{i}$ or $b_{i}$). Therefore every rim edge conflicts with every spoke edge, implying no rim edge can use any color used on $S$. Consequently, at least one additional color beyond those $6$ is necessary. Thus at least $7$ colors are needed.\n\nUpper bound:\nAssign six distinct colors to the six spoke edges in $S$, and assign a seventh color to all three rim edges in $R$. This is a valid strong edge coloring because:\n- Any two spoke edges are incident at $c$ and already have distinct colors.\n- Any rim edge and any spoke edge have different colors by construction, and they must differ because $c$ is adjacent to both endpoints of each rim edge.\n- Any two rim edges $a_{i}b_{i}$ and $a_{j}b_{j}$ with $i\\neq j$ do not share a vertex, and no endpoint of one is adjacent to an endpoint of the other (each $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ is adjacent only to $c$ and its partner within the same triangle). Hence they may share the same color without violating the strong constraint.\n\nTherefore a strong edge coloring with $7$ colors exists, and no coloring with fewer than $7$ colors is possible. Hence the strong chromatic index of $F_{3}$ equals $7$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7}$$", "id": "1535937"}, {"introduction": "Moving from a single graph to a general family, this practice problem [@problem_id:1535985] challenges you to determine the strong chromatic index for any complete bipartite graph of the form $K_{2,n}$.

There are no direct links between the two hubs, and no direct links between any pair of client nodes.\n\nTo prevent signal interference, a frequency must be assigned to each communication link according to two strict rules:\n1.  Any two links that connect to the same node (either a hub or a client) must be assigned different frequencies.\n2.  If two links, say Link A and Link B, do not connect to the same node, they must still be assigned different frequencies if there exists a third link in the network that connects an endpoint of Link A to an endpoint of Link B.\n\nDetermine the minimum number of distinct frequencies required to operate this network.
