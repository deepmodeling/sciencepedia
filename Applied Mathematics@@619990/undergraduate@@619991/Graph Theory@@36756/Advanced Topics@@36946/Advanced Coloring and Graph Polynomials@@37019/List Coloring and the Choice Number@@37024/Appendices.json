An $L$-coloring of $G$ is a vertex coloring $c$ such that for every vertex $v$, the chosen color $c(v)$ is in the list $L(v)$, and for every pair of adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$, their assigned colors are different, i.e., $c(u) \\neq c(v)$.\n\nConsider the complete bipartite graph $G = K_{3,3}$.

No, a valid $L$-coloring does not exist because the graph $K_{3,3}$ is not 2-colorable.\n\nE. It is impossible to determine whether a valid $L$-coloring exists with the given information.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine if a valid $L$-coloring exists for the complete bipartite graph $K_{3,3}$ with a specific list assignment $L$. A valid $L$-coloring must satisfy two conditions for every vertex and edge:\n1. The color assigned to each vertex must be from its specified list.\n2. Adjacent vertices must have different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the given options.\n\nFirst, consider option D. It claims that no coloring exists because $K_{3,3}$ is not 2-colorable. This statement is incorrect. A graph is 2-colorable if and only if it is bipartite. $K_{3,3}$ is the definition of a bipartite graph, so it is 2-colorable. For example, we could color all vertices in partition $U$ with color 'A' and all vertices in partition $V$ with color 'B'. Since there are no edges within $U$ or $V$, this is a valid 2-coloring. Therefore, option D is false.\n\nNext, consider option A. It proposes the coloring $c(u_1)=1, c(u_2)=1, c(u_3)=2, c(v_1)=2, c(v_2)=3, c(v_3)=1$. This is not a valid $L$-coloring for two reasons. First, it violates the list constraint for vertex $v_3$: the assigned color $c(v_3)=1$ is not in its list $L(v_3)=\\{2,3\\}$. Second, it violates the adjacency constraint: vertices $u_3$ and $v_1$ are adjacent, but both are assigned color 2. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nNow, consider option B. It proposes a coloring $c$: $c(u_1)=2, c(u_2)=1, c(u_3)=3, c(v_1)=1, c(v_2)=2, c(v_3)=2$.\nLet's check the list constraints first. For vertex $v_2$, the proposed color is $c(v_2)=2$, which is not in its list $L(v_2)=\\{1,3\\}$. The color chosen for $v_2$ is not in its list. Therefore, the coloring in option B is invalid.\n\nHaving eliminated options A, B, D, and E (as the problem is well-defined), we are left with C. Let's prove that C is correct by showing that no $L$-coloring exists.\n\nLet's attempt to construct an $L$-coloring. We must pick colors for each vertex from their respective lists. Since the vertices within partition $U$ are not adjacent to each other, we can choose their colors $c(u_1), c(u_2), c(u_3)$ independently from their lists, as long as we can then color the vertices in $V$.\nThe set of colors used for partition $U$ is $C_U = \\{c(u_1), c(u_2), c(u_3)\\}$.\n\nCase 1: The colors $c(u_1), c(u_2), c(u_3)$ are not all distinct. This means $|C_U| = 2$. (It cannot be 1, because there is no single color present in all three lists $L(u_1), L(u_2), L(u_3)$).\nLet's assume we use two colors, $\\{a, b\\}$, for the vertices in $U$. For this to be possible, at least two vertices in $U$ must share a color.\nFor example, let $c(u_1) = c(u_2)$. The only common color in $L(u_1)$ and $L(u_2)$ is 1. So, we must have $c(u_1)=1$ and $c(u_2)=1$. For $u_3$, we can choose either $c(u_3)=2$ or $c(u_3)=3$.\n- If $c(u_3)=2$, the set of colors on $U$ is $C_U = \\{1, 2\\}$. Now consider vertex $v_1 \\in V$. It is adjacent to all vertices in $U$. Thus, $c(v_1)$ must be different from all colors in $C_U$, i.e., $c(v_1) \\notin \\{1, 2\\}$. However, the list for $v_1$ is $L(v_1)=\\{1, 2\\}$. There is no color in $L(v_1)$ that is not in $C_U$. So, $v_1$ cannot be colored. This attempt fails.\n- If $c(u_3)=3$, the set of colors on $U$ is $C_U = \\{1, 3\\}$. Now consider vertex $v_2 \\in V$. It is adjacent to all vertices in $U$. Its color $c(v_2)$ must not be in $C_U = \\{1, 3\\}$. But its list is $L(v_2)=\\{1, 3\\}$. So, $v_2$ cannot be colored. This attempt fails too.\nBy symmetry, any attempt to color the vertices in $U$ with only two colors will fail. If the two colors used are $\\{a,b\\}$, then the vertex $v_i \\in V$ whose list is $L(v_i)=\\{a,b\\}$ cannot be colored. The list-assignment is constructed such that for any pair of colors from $\\{1,2,3\\}$, there is a vertex in $V$ with that list.\n\nCase 2: The colors $c(u_1), c(u_2), c(u_3)$ are all distinct.\nThis means $|C_U|=3$.\nWe need to find $c(u_1) \\in L(u_1)$, $c(u_2) \\in L(u_2)$, and $c(u_3) \\in L(u_3)$ that are all different.\nLet's try to assign them.\n- If we choose $c(u_1)=1$, then to be distinct, $c(u_2)$ must be 3 (from $L(u_2)=\\{1,3\\}$). Then to be distinct from 1 and 3, $c(u_3)$ must be 2 (from $L(u_3)=\\{2,3\\}$). This gives the color choices $(c(u_1), c(u_2), c(u_3)) = (1, 3, 2)$.\n- If we choose $c(u_1)=2$, then to be distinct, $c(u_2)$ can be 1 or 3. If $c(u_2)=1$, then $c(u_3)$ must be 3. This gives $(2, 1, 3)$. If $c(u_2)=3$, then $c(u_3)$ must be different from 2 and 3, which is impossible from its list $L(u_3)=\\{2,3\\}$.\nSo there are two ways to color $U$ with distinct colors: $(1,3,2)$ and $(2,1,3)$.\nIn both scenarios, the set of colors used on partition $U$ is $C_U = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\nNow, consider any vertex in $V$, for instance $v_1$. It is adjacent to $u_1, u_2, u_3$. Therefore, its color $c(v_1)$ must be different from $c(u_1), c(u_2), c(u_3)$. This means $c(v_1)$ cannot be 1, 2, or 3. However, the list for $v_1$ is $L(v_1)=\\{1, 2\\}$, which only contains colors from the forbidden set. Thus, $v_1$ cannot be colored. The same logic applies to $v_2$ and $v_3$.\n\nSince both cases (coloring $U$ with 2 colors or 3 colors) lead to a contradiction, no valid $L$-coloring exists for the entire graph. The reasoning matches option C: for any valid coloring of $U$, the set of colors used on $U$ will conflict with the list of at least one vertex in $V$, making a full coloring impossible.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1519305"}, {"introduction": "A central task in list coloring theory is to determine the choice number, $\\text{ch}(G)$, of a graph $G$.

For the corresponding vertex $y_{i}$ with $L(y_{i})$ equal to that pair, both colors in $L(y_{i})$ coincide with the colors on its two neighbors $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ and are therefore forbidden. Hence $y_{i}$ has no available color, contradicting the existence of an $L$-coloring. Thus $K_{2,4}$ is not $2$-choosable, so $\\text{ch}(K_{2,4}) \\geq 3$.\n\nNext, we show that $K_{2,4}$ is $3$-choosable, which will establish $\\text{ch}(K_{2,4}) \\leq 3$.
