One such method is Mycielski's construction, which is known for creating triangle-free graphs with arbitrarily large chromatic numbers. This problem asks you to apply this construction to a simple graph and determine the chromatic number of the result.\n\nThe **chromatic number** of a graph, denoted $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nLet $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V=\\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n\\}$ and edge set $E$. The **Mycielski graph** of $G$, denoted $M(G)$, is a new graph constructed as follows:\n1.

This graph has a vertex set $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$ and an edge set consisting of $(v_1, v_2)$ and $(v_2, v_3)$.\n\nConstruct the graph $M(P_3)$ and determine its chromatic number.", "solution": "Let $P_{3}$ have vertex set $V=\\{v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}\\}$ and edge set $E=\\{(v_{1},v_{2}),(v_{2},v_{3})\\}$.

Since $P_{3}$ is bipartite, any proper $2$-coloring of $\\{v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}\\}$ must assign the same color to $v_{1}$ and $v_{3}$ and the other color to $v_{2}$. Without loss of generality, let $c(v_{1})=1$, $c(v_{2})=2$, and $c(v_{3})=1$. The vertex $u_{2}$ is adjacent to both $v_{1}$ and $v_{3}$, so $c(u_{2})\\neq 1$, hence $c(u_{2})=2$. Because $w$ is adjacent to $u_{2}$, we must have $c(w)\\neq 2$, so $c(w)=1$. Now $u_{1}$ is adjacent to $v_{2}$ and $w$, so $c(u_{1})\\neq c(v_{2})=2$ and $c(u_{1})\\neq c(w)=1$, which is impossible with only two colors.

Define $c(v_{1})=1$, $c(v_{2})=2$, $c(v_{3})=1$, set $c(u_{1})=1$, $c(u_{2})=2$, $c(u_{3})=1$, and assign $c(w)=3$.

Let's consider a variation of this construction.\n\nLet $G=(V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V=\\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n\\}$ and edge set $E$. The modified Mycielski graph, denoted $M_S(G)$, is constructed as follows:\n1. The vertex set of $M_S(G)$ is $V \\cup U \\cup \\{w\\}$, where $U = \\{u_1, u_2, \\dots, u_n\\}$ is a set of new vertices corresponding to the vertices in $V$, and $w$ is an additional single vertex.\n2. The edge set of $M_S(G)$ consists of three parts:\n    a. The original edge set $E$ of $G$.\n    b. For each vertex $v_i \\in V$, the corresponding vertex $u_i \\in U$ is made adjacent to all vertices in the neighborhood of $v_i$ in $G$. That is, for every edge $(v_i, v_j) \\in E$, an edge $(u_i, v_j)$ is added to $M_S(G)$. Note that there are no edges between any two vertices in $U$.\n    c. The vertex $w$ is made adjacent to a specific subset of vertices in $U$. Let $V_S \\subseteq V$ be a predefined subset of vertices in the original graph $G$. The corresponding subset of vertices in $U$ is $S = \\{u_i \\in U \\mid v_i \\in V_S \\}$. The vertex $w$ is made adjacent to every vertex in $S$, and only to those vertices.\n\nNow, consider a specific graph $G$ which is formed by the union of two complete graphs, each on 5 vertices, which share exactly one common vertex. Let these two complete graphs be $A$ and $B$. The shared vertex is $x$. Thus, the vertex set of $A$ is $V(A)=\\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, x\\}$ and the vertex set of $B$ is $V(B)=\\{b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, x\\}$. The vertex set of $G$ is $V(A) \\cup V(B)$.\n\nFor this graph $G$, we construct the modified Mycielski graph $M_S(G)$ by choosing the subset $V_S$ to be the vertex set of the complete graph $A$.

Since $A$ is an induced $K_{5}$ subgraph of $G$, we have $\\chi(G) \\geq 5$. A $5$-coloring of $G$ exists: color $A$ with five distinct colors, and color $B$ with the same five colors so that the shared vertex $x$ keeps its color and the other four vertices of $B$ use the four colors different from $c(x)$.

Fix any proper coloring $c:V(G)\\to C$ with $|C|=5$. For any $v\\in V(G)$, the set of colors forbidden to $u_{v}$ is precisely\n$$\nF(u_{v})=\\{c(z):z\\in N_{G}(v)\\}.\n$$\nWe now determine $F(u_{v})$ for $v\\in V(A)$ in such a $5$-coloring.\n\nIf $v\\in V(A)\\setminus\\{x\\}$, then $N_{G}(v)=V(A)\\setminus\\{v\\}$, which in a proper coloring of the clique $A$ uses $4$ pairwise distinct colors.

Since $w$ is adjacent to every vertex in $S$, $w$ is adjacent to vertices of all $5$ colors, and hence cannot receive any of these $5$ colors. Therefore any proper coloring of $M_{S}(G)$ uses at least $6$ colors, so\n$$\n\\chi\\bigl(M_{S}(G)\\bigr)\\geq 6.\n$$\n\nTo show $\\chi\\bigl(M_{S}(G)\\bigr)\\leq 6$, construct an explicit $6$-coloring: color $V(G)$ with $5$ colors as above; color each $u_{v}$ with $c(v)$; and assign $w$ a sixth color not used on $V\\cup U$.
