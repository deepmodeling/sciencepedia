It is a two-variable polynomial that can be computed for any given graph $G$ by recursively applying a set of rules known as the deletion-contraction recurrence.\n\nThe rules are as follows:\n1.  If $G$ is a graph containing at least one edge $e$:\n    a. If the edge $e$ is a bridge (i.e., its removal increases the number of connected components of the graph), then $T_G(x,y) = x \\cdot T_{G-e}(x,y)$, where $G-e$ is the graph $G$ with edge $e$ deleted.\n    b.

If a graph $G$ consists of two disconnected subgraphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ (i.e., $G = G_1 \\cup G_2$), then its Tutte polynomial is the product of the polynomials of its components: $T_G(x,y) = T_{G_1}(x,y) \\cdot T_{G_2}(x,y)$.\n\nA complete bipartite graph, $K_{m,n}$, is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets, one of size $m$ and the other of size $n$, such that every vertex in the first set is connected to every vertex in the second set, and there are no connections within the sets.\n\nUsing the rules defined above, determine the Tutte polynomial for the complete bipartite graph $K_{2,2}$.
