A Turán graph, denoted $T(n, r)$, is a graph with $n$ vertices constructed as follows:\n\nFirst, the set of $n$ vertices is partitioned into $r$ disjoint subsets, let's call them $V_1, V_2, \\ldots, V_r$. The sizes of these subsets are chosen to be as close to equal as possible. Specifically, if $n$ is divided by $r$ to get a quotient $q$ and a remainder $s$ (i.e., $n = qr + s$, where $0 \\le s < r$), then $s$ of the subsets have size $q+1$ and the remaining $r-s$ subsets have size $q$.\n\nSecond, an edge is drawn between two vertices if and only if they belong to different subsets. No edges exist between vertices within the same subset.\n\nGiven this definition, calculate the exact number of edges in the Turán graph $T(11, 4)$.", "solution": "We are given $n=11$ and $r=4$.
