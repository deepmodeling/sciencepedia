This problem frames Mantel's Theorem in a real-world scenario of research collaborations, providing a direct application of its core result. By solving it, you will practice calculating the upper bound for edges in a triangle-free graph, a foundational skill in this field [@problem_id:1533181].", "problem": "A consortium of 17 distinct research laboratories is established to spearhead advancements in a new technological field. To facilitate progress, labs can form direct 'collaboration links' to share data and resources. However, to prevent conflicts of interest and maintain intellectual property boundaries, a regulatory protocol is enforced: no group of three laboratories can all be mutually linked with each other. A 'mutual link' means that for any three labs, say Lab A, Lab B, and Lab C, it is forbidden for A and B, B and C, and C and A to all have collaboration links simultaneously.\n\nWhat is the maximum possible number of distinct collaboration links that can be established among the 17 labs while adhering to this protocol?", "solution": "Interpret the laboratories as vertices of a simple graph and collaboration links as edges. The protocol forbids any triple of labs from all being mutually linked, which is precisely the condition that the graph contain no triangle, i.e., no $K_3$ subgraph.\n\nBy Mantel's theorem (the $r=2$ case of Turán's theorem), the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph on $n$ vertices is\n$$\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^{2}}{4} \\right\\rfloor.\n$$\nFor $n=17$, this yields\n$$\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{17^{2}}{4} \\right\\rfloor=\\left\\lfloor \\frac{289}{4} \\right\\rfloor=\\left\\lfloor 72+\\frac{1}{4} \\right\\rfloor=72.\n$$\nThis bound is achieved by the complete bipartite graph $K_{8,9}$, which has $8 \\times 9 = 72$ edges and is triangle-free because bipartite graphs contain no odd cycles, in particular no $K_3$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of collaboration links is $72$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{72}$$", "id": "1533181"}, {"introduction": "Knowing the maximum number of edges is one thing, but understanding the graphs that achieve this maximum is another. The Turan graph $T(n, 2)$ is the unique graph that holds the maximum number of edges without containing a triangle. This exercise invites you to explore the very structure of this extremal graph by asking what happens the moment we violate its triangle-free property, helping you build intuition for why the Turan graph is so special [@problem_id:1519862].", "problem": "In graph theory, a triangle is a complete subgraph on three vertices, often denoted as $K_3$. A graph is called triangle-free if it contains no such subgraphs. For an integer $n \\geq 2$, the Turan graph $T(n, 2)$ is a specific $n$-vertex graph constructed as follows: the set of $n$ vertices is partitioned into two disjoint subsets, $V_1$ and $V_2$, with sizes as close to equal as possible, i.e., $|V_1| = \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ and $|V_2| = \\lceil n/2 \\rceil$. Two vertices are connected by an edge if and only if they belong to different subsets. The resulting graph $T(n,2)$ is triangle-free.\n\nConsider a new graph $G$ that is formed by adding exactly one edge to $T(n, 2)$. Since $T(n,2)$ is triangle-free, any triangle in $G$ must be a 'new' triangle created by this additional edge. Depending on which two vertices the new edge connects, the number of new triangles might vary.\n\nAssuming $n \\geq 3$, determine the minimum possible number of new triangles created by the addition of this single edge. Express your answer as a single, closed-form expression in terms of $n$.", "solution": "Let $T(n,2)$ be the complete bipartite graph with bipartition $(V_{1},V_{2})$ where $|V_{1}|=\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ and $|V_{2}|=\\lceil n/2 \\rceil$. By construction, $T(n,2)$ has all edges between $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ and no edges within either part, so it is triangle-free.\n\nAdding exactly one new edge to obtain $G$ cannot introduce a new cross-edge, because every pair of vertices across the bipartition is already adjacent. Therefore, the new edge must connect two vertices within the same part, say $u,v \\in V_{i}$ for some $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$.\n\nIn any graph, the number of triangles containing a given edge $uv$ equals the number of common neighbors of $u$ and $v$. In $T(n,2)$, if $u,v \\in V_{i}$, then every vertex $w$ in the opposite part $V_{3-i}$ is adjacent to both $u$ and $v$, while no vertex in $V_{i}$ is adjacent to either $u$ or $v$ (other than the new edge between $u$ and $v$). Hence, the number of triangles created by adding the edge $uv$ within $V_{i}$ is exactly\n$$\n|V_{3-i}|.\n$$\n\nThus:\n- If the new edge is added within $V_{1}$, the number of new triangles is $|V_{2}|=\\lceil n/2 \\rceil$.\n- If the new edge is added within $V_{2}$, the number of new triangles is $|V_{1}|=\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$.\n\nTo minimize the number of new triangles, we choose to add the edge within the larger part, so that the opposite part (which counts the triangles) is as small as possible. For $n \\geq 3$, the larger part has size at least $2$, so this choice is feasible.

This raises a fascinating question: what is the maximum number of edges if we specifically forbid a bipartite structure?
