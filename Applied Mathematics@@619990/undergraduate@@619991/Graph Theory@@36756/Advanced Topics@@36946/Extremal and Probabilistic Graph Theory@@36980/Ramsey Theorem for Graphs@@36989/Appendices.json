By enforcing the condition that no monochromatic triangles ($K_3$) exist, we can deduce the precise structure of the \"ally\" or \"rival\" subgraphs, providing a rigorous argument for the famous lower bound $R(3,3) > 5$ [@problem_id:1530508].", "problem": "In a group of 5 individuals, an anthropologist observes their relationships.

The condition “no group of 3 all allies” means $G_{A}$ is triangle-free; the condition “no group of 3 all rivals” means $\\overline{G_{A}}$ is triangle-free. Thus both $G_{A}$ and $\\overline{G_{A}}$ are triangle-free on 5 vertices.\n\nWe determine the structure of $G_{A}$ by degree constraints. Let $d_{G}(v)$ denote the degree of a vertex $v$ in $G_{A}$.

Hence $d_{G}(v)\\neq 0$, and by complementarity also $d_{G}(v)\\neq 4$.\n\n2) Excluding degrees $1$ and $3$: If $d_{G}(v)=1$, then $d_{\\overline{G}}(v)=3$.

This final practice introduces a revolutionary alternative pioneered by Paul Erdős: the probabilistic method. Instead of building a specific coloring, we will use probability to show that a good coloring (one without a monochromatic $K_5$) is not just possible, but likely to exist in a randomly colored graph on a certain number of vertices, thereby establishing a strong lower bound for $R(5,5)$ [@problem_id:1530489].", "problem": "In graph theory, a Ramsey number $R(k, s)$ is the smallest integer $N$ such that for any complete graph on $N$ vertices, $K_N$, whose edges are colored with two colors (say, red and blue), there must exist either a red complete subgraph on $k$ vertices ($K_k$) or a blue complete subgraph on $s$ vertices ($K_s$). When $k=s$, we consider the diagonal Ramsey number $R(k, k)$.\n\nA powerful technique to establish a lower bound for $R(k, k)$ is the probabilistic method.
