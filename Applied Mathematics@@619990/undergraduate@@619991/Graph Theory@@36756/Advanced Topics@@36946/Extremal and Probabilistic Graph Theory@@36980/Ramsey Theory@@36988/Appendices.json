To foster connections, it is decided that every pair of distinct diplomats will establish exactly one of two types of ties: a 'friendly' tie or a 'rival' tie. The summit organizers are concerned about social dynamics and wish to avoid creating any unstable groups. An unstable group is defined as any set of three diplomats where the ties are all of the same type. That is, the organizers want to avoid any group of three diplomats who are all mutual friends, and any group of three who are all mutual rivals.\n\nWhich of the following assignments of ties successfully avoids any unstable groups?\n\nA.

We test each assignment for the presence or absence of such a monochromatic $K_3$.\n\nFor option A, the friendly ties are $(D_1,D_2),(D_2,D_3),(D_3,D_1),(D_4,D_5)$. The triple $\\{D_1,D_2,D_3\\}$ has all three edges friendly, since $(D_1,D_2),(D_2,D_3),(D_3,D_1)$ are all friendly. Therefore there is a monochromatic triangle of friendly ties, so option A creates an unstable group and fails.\n\nFor option B, the friendly ties are all edges incident to $D_1$, namely $(D_1,D_2),(D_1,D_3),(D_1,D_4),(D_1,D_5)$, and all other pairs are rivals. Then among $D_2,D_3,D_4,D_5$ every pair is a rival tie. In particular, the triple $\\{D_2,D_3,D_4\\}$ has edges $(D_2,D_3),(D_2,D_4),(D_3,D_4)$ all rival, forming a monochromatic rival triangle. Hence option B creates an unstable group and fails.\n\nFor option C, the friendly ties form the $5$-cycle $C_5$ with edges $(D_1,D_2),(D_2,D_3),(D_3,D_4),(D_4,D_5),(D_5,D_1)$. A cycle $C_5$ is triangle-free, so there is no monochromatic triangle of friendly ties. The rival ties are precisely the complement of this $C_5$ in $K_5$. The complement of a $C_5$ on $5$ vertices is again a $C_5$ (each vertex has degree $2$, and the edges connect vertices at distance $2$ along the original cycle), which is also triangle-free. Therefore there is no monochromatic triangle of rival ties either. Hence option C avoids unstable groups and succeeds.\n\nFor option D, the rival ties are $(D_1,D_2),(D_2,D_3),(D_3,D_1)$. The triple $\\{D_1,D_2,D_3\\}$ then has all three edges rival, which is a monochromatic rival triangle, creating an unstable group.
