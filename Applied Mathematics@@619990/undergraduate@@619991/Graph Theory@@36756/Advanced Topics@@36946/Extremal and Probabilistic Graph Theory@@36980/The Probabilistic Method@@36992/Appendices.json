For any two players, each has a probability of $1/2$ of winning their game, and all game outcomes are mutually independent.\n\nA configuration of particular interest is the \"cyclic triple\". A cyclic triple is a set of three distinct players, let's call them P1, P2, and P3, such that P1 defeats P2, P2 defeats P3, and P3 in turn defeats P1.

The network of sensors is modeled as a simple undirected graph $G=(V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of $n$ sensors, and an edge $(u,v) \\in E$ exists if sensors $u$ and $v$ are close enough to interfere with each other. To reduce power consumption and signal interference, the company wants to activate a subset of sensors $I \\subseteq V$ such that no two active sensors interfere with each other. This means the set $I$ must be an independent set of the graph $G$. The network is designed such that any given sensor can interfere with at most $\\Delta$ other sensors, meaning the maximum degree of the graph is $\\Delta$.\n\nA randomized, two-stage algorithm is implemented to generate the independent set $I$:\n\n1.  **Candidacy Stage:** A preliminary set of candidate sensors, $S$, is formed. Each sensor in $V$ is independently chosen to be in $S$ with a fixed probability $p$.\n2.  **Conflict Resolution Stage:** Any edge whose both endpoints are in $S$ is called a \"conflicting edge\". To form the final independent set $I$, a new set $S'$ is created from $S$ by removing, for each conflicting edge, exactly one of its endpoints. The final set $I$ is $S'$.\n\nThe expected size of the set $I$, denoted $\\mathbb{E}[|I|]$, is difficult to compute directly as it depends on the precise graph structure and the specific removal choices.

The total number of sensors removed from $S$ is at most $Y$. Thus, the size of the final set is bounded by $|I| \\ge X - Y$.
