Determine the exact value of this constant $C$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the constant $C$ in the asymptotic formula for the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex graph that is free of the House Graph $H$, denoted $\\text{ex}(n, H)$. This is a classic problem in extremal graph theory, and its solution relies on the fundamental Erdős-Stone theorem.\n\nThe Erdős-Stone theorem states that for any graph $H$ with at least one edge, the maximum number of edges in an $H$-free graph on $n$ vertices is given by:\n$$ \\text{ex}(n, H) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\chi(H)-1} + o(1)\\right) \\frac{n^2}{2} $$\nwhere $\\chi(H)$ is the chromatic number of the graph $H$, and the $o(1)$ term represents a quantity that approaches zero as $n \\to \\infty$. This formula is valid for any non-bipartite graph $H$ (i.e., $\\chi(H) \\ge 3$). If $H$ is bipartite ($\\chi(H)=2$), the number of edges is of a smaller order, $\\text{ex}(n, H) = o(n^2)$.\n\nTo apply this theorem, we must first determine the chromatic number of the given House Graph, $H$. The House Graph is defined on vertices $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5\\}$ with edges $E = \\{(v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3), (v_3, v_4), (v_4, v_1), (v_1, v_5), (v_2, v_5)\\}$.\n\nFirst, we establish a lower bound for $\\chi(H)$. The vertices $\\{v_1, v_2, v_5\\}$ form a triangle, since the edges $(v_1, v_2)$, $(v_1, v_5)$, and $(v_2, v_5)$ are all present in the edge set $E$. A graph containing a triangle (a 3-clique) cannot be colored with fewer than 3 colors. Therefore, $\\chi(H) \\ge 3$.\n\nNext, we establish an upper bound by attempting to color the graph with 3 colors. If we succeed, we can conclude that $\\chi(H) = 3$. Let the available colors be {1, 2, 3}.\n1. We start with the triangle on $\\{v_1, v_2, v_5\\}$. We must assign a different color to each of these vertices. Let's set the coloring as follows:\n   - $c(v_1) = 1$\n   - $c(v_2) = 2$\n   - $c(v_5) = 3$\n2. Now, we must color the remaining vertices, $v_3$ and $v_4$.\n3. Consider vertex $v_3$. It is adjacent to $v_2$ (colored 2) and $v_4$. We can assign a color different from color 2, for example, color 1. So, let $c(v_3) = 1$.\n4. Finally, consider vertex $v_4$. It is adjacent to $v_1$ (colored 1) and $v_3$ (colored 1). Since both its neighbors are colored with color 1, we are free to assign any other color. Let's choose color 2. So, let $c(v_4) = 2$.\n5. We have now assigned a color to every vertex: $c(v_1)=1, c(v_2)=2, c(v_3)=1, c(v_4)=2, c(v_5)=3$. We must verify that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n   - $(v_1, v_2) \\to (1, 2)$: OK\n   - $(v_2, v_3) \\to (2, 1)$: OK\n   - $(v_3, v_4) \\to (1, 2)$: OK\n   - $(v_4, v_1) \\to (2, 1)$: OK\n   - $(v_1, v_5) \\to (1, 3)$: OK\n   - $(v_2, v_5) \\to (2, 3)$: OK\nSince we have found a valid 3-coloring, we have shown that $\\chi(H) \\le 3$.\n\nCombining our lower and upper bounds, we conclude that the chromatic number of the House Graph is exactly $\\chi(H) = 3$.\n\nNow we can substitute this value into the Erdős-Stone theorem formula:\n$$ \\text{ex}(n, H) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3-1}\\right) \\frac{n^2}{2} + o(n^2) $$\n$$ \\text{ex}(n, H) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\frac{n^2}{2} + o(n^2) $$\n$$ \\text{ex}(n, H) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\frac{n^2}{2} + o(n^2) $$\n$$ \\text{ex}(n, H) = \\frac{1}{4} n^2 + o(n^2) $$\n\nThe problem states that for large $n$, $\\text{ex}(n, H) \\sim C n^2$. This is equivalent to saying $\\text{ex}(n, H) = C n^2 + o(n^2)$. By comparing this with our derived expression, we can identify the constant $C$.\n$$ C n^2 = \\frac{1}{4} n^2 $$\nTherefore, the value of the constant is $C = \\frac{1}{4}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$$", "id": "1540704"}, {"introduction": "Building on the direct application of the Erdős-Stone theorem, this problem delves deeper into the most critical parameter in its formula: the chromatic number $\\chi(H)$.
