The complement $\\overline{G}$ therefore has exactly $k$ connected components, each an induced clique whose sizes are precisely the part sizes of $G$.\n\nStatement A: $G$ is a complete multipartite graph.\nNecessity: Every $T(n,k)$ is complete multipartite, so this condition is necessary.\nInsufficiency: A complete multipartite graph need not have parts with sizes differing by at most $1$. For example, $K_{3,1}$ on $4$ vertices is complete multipartite, but it is not isomorphic to $T(4,1)$ (empty graph), $T(4,2)$ (two parts of sizes $2,2$), $T(4,3)$ (parts $2,1,1$), or $T(4,4)$ ($K_4$). Hence A is not sufficient.\n\nStatement B: For every induced subgraph $H$ of $G$, the chromatic number of $H$ equals the clique number of $H$.\nThis is the definition of a perfect graph. Necessity: $T(n,k)$ is perfect because it is complete multipartite and its complement is a disjoint union of cliques, both of which are perfect classes; thus the property holds for general Turán graphs. Insufficiency: Many perfect graphs are not complete multipartite and hence not Turán; for example, a path $P_{4}$ is perfect (being bipartite) but not complete multipartite, so it is not isomorphic to any $T(n,k)$. Hence B is not sufficient.\n\nStatement C: $G$ is isomorphic to the extremal graph specified by Turán's theorem for some forbidden clique $K_{r+1}$ with $r \\ge 2$.\nSufficiency: By Turán's theorem, the unique extremal $K_{r+1}$-free graph on $n$ vertices is $T(n,r)$, so this condition implies $G$ is a Turán graph.\nNon-necessity: General Turán graphs include $T(n,1)$, which is the empty graph on $n$ vertices. This graph is not extremal for forbidding $K_{r+1}$ with any $r \\ge 2$ (for $r=1$, it is extremal, but the statement disallows $r=1$).

Since the part sizes in $T(n,k)$ differ by at most $1$, the clique sizes in $\\overline{G}$ also differ by at most $1$. Thus D holds for every general Turán graph.\nSufficiency: If $\\overline{G}$ is a disjoint union of cliques with sizes differing by at most $1$, then $G$ is complete multipartite with parts given by those cliques, and the part sizes differ by at most $1$. Therefore $G$ is isomorphic to $T(n,k)$ where $k$ equals the number of cliques in $\\overline{G}$.
