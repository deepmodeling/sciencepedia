By engaging with this problem, you will solidify your understanding of the structural properties of subgraphs, a crucial first step in tackling the Zarankiewicz problem [@problem_id:1548494].", "problem": "Consider a bipartite graph $G$ constructed with two disjoint sets of vertices, $U$ and $V$.

Yes, the graph contains a $K_{2,2}$ subgraph.\n\nB. No, the graph is $K_{2,2}$-free.\n\nC. The existence of a $K_{2,2}$ subgraph is dependent on the specific labeling of vertices in $V$.\n\nD.

This practice challenges you to find the absolute maximum number of edges a bipartite graph can have without forming a $K_{2,2}$.

To promote knowledge sharing and prevent skill silos, the project manager wants to assign developers to work on various modules. An assignment is a pairing of one developer with one module. The manager imposes a strict collaboration rule to ensure diverse expertise: no two developers are allowed to be assigned to the exact same pair of modules. For example, if Developer A and Developer B are both assigned to Module 1, they cannot both also be assigned to Module 2. The goal is to maximize the total number of developer-module assignments to accelerate the project. What is the absolute maximum number of unique developer-module assignments possible under this rule?", "solution": "Model the situation as a simple bipartite graph with developer set $D=\\{d_{1},d_{2},d_{3}\\}$ and module set $M=\\{m_{1},m_{2},m_{3},m_{4}\\}$. An assignment is an edge between a developer and a module. Let $t_{j}$ denote the number of developers assigned to module $m_{j}$, so the total number of assignments is\n$$\nE=\\sum_{j=1}^{4} t_{j}.\n$$\nThe collaboration rule says: any two developers cannot be assigned together to two different modules; equivalently, any pair of developers shares at most one module. For a fixed module $m_{j}$, the number of developer pairs who share it is $\\binom{t_{j}}{2}$. Summing over modules counts, for each pair of developers, how many modules they share; thus\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{4} \\binom{t_{j}}{2} \\le \\binom{3}{2}=3,\n$$\nbecause there are $\\binom{3}{2}=3$ developer pairs and each pair can be counted at most once.\n\nSince $t_{j}\\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}$, we have $\\binom{t_{j}}{2}\\in\\{0,0,1,3\\}$. To maximize $E=\\sum t_{j}$ under $\\sum \\binom{t_{j}}{2}\\le 3$, observe:\n- If some module has $t_{j}=3$, it contributes $3$ to the binomial sum, exhausting the entire budget, so all other modules must have $t\\le 1$. This yields at most $E\\le 3+1+1+1=6$.\n- Otherwise, all $t_{j}\\le 2$. Each module with $t_{j}=2$ uses $1$ unit of the binomial budget. With total budget $3$, we can have at most three modules with $t_{j}=2$, and the remaining module can have $t=1$ at no additional binomial cost. This gives\n$$\nE\\le 2+2+2+1=7.\n$$\n\nThe upper bound $E\\le 7$ is attainable. For example, assign:\n- Module $m_{1}$ to developers $d_{1},d_{2}$,\n- Module $m_{2}$ to developers $d_{1},d_{3}$,\n- Module $m_{3}$ to developers $d_{2},d_{3}$,\n- Module $m_{4}$ to developer $d_{1}$ only.\n\nHere $t=(2,2,2,1)$, so $E=7$, and each developer pair shares exactly one module, satisfying the rule.
