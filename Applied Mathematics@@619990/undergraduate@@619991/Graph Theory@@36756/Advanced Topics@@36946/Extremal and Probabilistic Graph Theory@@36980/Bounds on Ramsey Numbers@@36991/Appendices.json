Equivalently, to prove a lower bound $R(s,t) > n$, it suffices to exhibit a specific red-blue edge-coloring of $K_{n}$ that avoids both a red $K_{s}$ and a blue $K_{t}$.\n\nWe apply this directly with $s=t=5$ and $n=50$. To validate the claim $R(5,5) > 50$, the construction must be a 2-coloring of the edges of $K_{50}$ that contains neither a monochromatic red $K_{5}$ nor a monochromatic blue $K_{5}$.

This exercise guides you through verifying the famous construction that proves $R(3,3) > 5$. By analyzing a specific edge-coloring of the complete graph $K_5$, you will demonstrate hands-on how to prove that a graph is free of monochromatic subgraphs, a foundational skill in combinatorial constructions [@problem_id:1484980].", "problem": "Consider the complete graph $K_5$ with vertices labeled by the set $V = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The edges of this graph are colored with two colors, Red and Blue, according to the following rule: an edge $\\{u, v\\}$ is colored Red if the absolute difference of its vertex labels, $|u - v|$, satisfies $|u - v| \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ or $|u - v| \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$. All other edges are colored Blue. A monochromatic triangle is a set of three vertices for which all three connecting edges have the same color.\n\nHow many monochromatic triangles exist in this colored graph?", "solution": "Let $V=\\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$. By the coloring rule, an edge $\\{u,v\\}$ is Red if and only if $|u-v|\\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ or $|u-v|\\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$. Since $|u-v|$ ranges over $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ for distinct $u,v\\in V$, this condition is equivalent to $v\\equiv u\\pm 1 \\pmod{5}$. Therefore, the Red edges are exactly the pairs $\\{i,i+1\\}$ (indices modulo $5$), which form the $5$-cycle $C_{5}$. A $5$-cycle contains no triangle: among any three distinct vertices on a cycle of length $5$, at least one pair is nonadjacent in that cycle, so not all three connecting edges can be present in the Red subgraph. Hence there are no Red triangles.\n\nAll other edges are Blue, i.e., those with $|u-v|\\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$ or $|u-v|\\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$. These connect vertices at distance two along the same cyclic order, forming the complementary graph of the Red $C_{5}$. The complement of $C_{5}$ in $K_{5}$ is again a $5$-cycle (the $5$-point star), which is also triangle-free by the same reasoning. Hence there are no Blue triangles.\n\nSince neither color class contains a triangle, the number of monochromatic triangles in this coloring of $K_{5}$ is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "1484980"}, {"introduction": "While constructing colorings establishes lower bounds, a different set of tools is needed to establish upper bounds.
