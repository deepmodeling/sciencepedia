The formula is satisfiable if there exists an assignment of 'true' or 'false' to the variables that makes the entire formula evaluate to 'true'.\n\nTo prove the existence of a satisfying assignment using a probabilistic approach, we consider a random assignment where each variable is independently set to 'true' with probability 1/2 and 'false' with probability 1/2. We define a 'bad event' for each clause, corresponding to that clause not being satisfied by the random assignment. If we can show that the probability of no bad events occurring is greater than zero, then a satisfying assignment must exist.\n\nThe Symmetric Lovász Local Lemma provides a powerful tool for such proofs. It states: Let $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_m$ be a set of events. Suppose that for each $i$, the probability $P(A_i) \\leq p$, and the event $A_i$ is mutually independent of all other events except for a set of at most $d$ of them.
