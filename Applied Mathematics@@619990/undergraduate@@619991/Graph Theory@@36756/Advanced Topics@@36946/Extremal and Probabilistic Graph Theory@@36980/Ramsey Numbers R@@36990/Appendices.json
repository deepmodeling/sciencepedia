We introduce a 2-edge-coloring on this graph using two colors, red and blue.

Each triangle contributes to $S$ as follows:\n- A monochromatic triangle contributes $3$ (at each of its $3$ vertices, the two incident edges are the same color).\n- A bichromatic triangle (two edges of one color, one of the other) contributes $1$ (only at the vertex where the two same-colored edges meet).\n\nLet $T$ be the total number of triangles in $K_{6}$, so $T = \\binom{6}{3} = 20$.
