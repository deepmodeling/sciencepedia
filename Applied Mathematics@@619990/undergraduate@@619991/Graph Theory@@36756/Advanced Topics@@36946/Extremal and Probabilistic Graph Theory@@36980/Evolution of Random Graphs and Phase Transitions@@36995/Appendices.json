A graph in this model consists of a set of $n$ vertices, and each of the $\\binom{n}{2}$ possible edges is present independently with probability $p$.\n\nA key concept in this field is the notion of a 'phase transition', where the qualitative structure of the graph changes abruptly as the edge probability $p$ crosses a certain threshold. The appearance of small subgraphs is a classic example of such a transition.\n\nConsider a specific non-trivial tree structure on 5 vertices, which we will call the \"Forked Path\" tree. It is constructed from a path on four vertices, labeled sequentially as $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4$, by adding a fifth vertex, $v_5$, and connecting it to one of the internal vertices of the path, for instance, $v_2$. The resulting graph has edges $(v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3), (v_3, v_4)$, and $(v_2, v_5)$.\n\nThe emergence of this Forked Path tree in $G(n,p)$ is governed by a threshold. For an introductory analysis, a precise way to characterize this threshold is to determine the function $p(n)$ for which the expected number of copies of the Forked Path tree in $G(n,p)$ is exactly equal to 1.\n\nYour task is to find this probability function $p(n)$.
