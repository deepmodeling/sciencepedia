We consider a connected graph where it is impossible to find three vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$ such that $A$ is connected to $B$ and $B$ to $C$, but $A$ and $C$ are not connected. This exercise reveals the powerful principle that forbidding a simple path of length two ($P_3$) as an induced subgraph forces the graph to be as dense as possible, illustrating a foundational characterization result in forbidden subgraph theory.

The network is modeled as a simple graph where each protein is a vertex and an edge between two vertices signifies a direct interaction between the corresponding proteins. The experimental data has confirmed two key properties of this network. First, the network is connected, meaning it's possible to trace a path of interactions from any protein to any other protein. Second, a specific three-protein structural pattern is entirely absent. This absent pattern consists of three distinct proteins, let's call them A, B, and C, where A interacts with B and B interacts with C, but A and C do not interact with each other.\n\nBased solely on this information, determine the total number of direct interactions in this protein network. Express your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $n$.", "solution": "Let $G$ be a simple connected graph on $n \\ge 3$ vertices with the property that there do not exist distinct vertices $A,B,C$ such that $AB$ and $BC$ are edges while $AC$ is not an edge. Equivalently, for all distinct $a,b,c$, if $ab$ and $bc$ are edges, then $ac$ is also an edge.\n\nClaim: $G$ is complete. To prove this, take any two distinct vertices $u$ and $w$. Since $G$ is connected, there exists a path $u=v_{0},v_{1},\\dots,v_{k}=w$ with $k \\ge 1$. If $k=1$, then $u$ and $w$ are adjacent and we are done. If $k \\ge 2$, apply the given property to the triple $(v_{0},v_{1},v_{2})$ to conclude that $v_{0}v_{2}$ is an edge. Then apply the property to $(v_{0},v_{2},v_{3})$ to get that $v_{0}v_{3}$ is an edge, and continue inductively to obtain that $v_{0}v_{k}$ is an edge. Hence $u$ and $w$ are adjacent. Since $u$ and $w$ were arbitrary, every pair of distinct vertices is adjacent, so $G$ is the complete graph $K_{n}$.\n\nThe number of edges in $K_{n}$ is the number of unordered pairs of vertices, which is\n$$\n\\binom{n}{2}=\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}.\n$$\nThus the total number of direct interactions is $\\binom{n}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\binom{n}{2}}$$", "id": "1505531"}, {"introduction": "Next, we shift our focus from connected forbidden subgraphs to disconnected ones, a concept that yields very different structural consequences. This practice challenges you to find the maximum number of edges in a graph that cannot contain two disjoint edges, a structure denoted $2K_2$.
