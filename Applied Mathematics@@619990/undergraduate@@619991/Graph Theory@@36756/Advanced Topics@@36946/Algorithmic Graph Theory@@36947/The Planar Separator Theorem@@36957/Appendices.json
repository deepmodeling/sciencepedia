The network consists of $n=900$ communication hubs, and their physical fiber optic connections can be represented as a planar graph (i.e., it can be drawn on a map without any connections crossing). For maintenance and fault isolation, the engineers plan to use network separators. A separator is a set of hubs that, when temporarily disabled, partition the remaining hubs into two or more disconnected groups.\n\nThe design must adhere to a principle derived from the Planar Separator Theorem. The theorem states that for any planar graph with $n$ vertices, it is always possible to find a set of separator vertices, $C$, whose removal partitions the remaining vertices into two disjoint sets, $A$, and $B$, such that there are no edges connecting any vertex in $A$ to any vertex in $B$.

Indeed, if $v_{c} \\notin C$, then the remaining graph is connected (all arms are joined via $v_{c}$), so the only partition with no edges between $A$ and $B$ has one of $A,B$ empty. Then the nonempty side would have size $n-|C|$, which must be at most $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$. Hence $|C| \\ge n - \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor = \\lceil n/2 \\rceil$, which is much larger than the constructions below.

Hence $s(k) \\ge 1 + \\frac{k-1}{2} = \\frac{k+1}{2}$. This lower bound is achievable: remove $v_{c}$ and remove a total of $(k-1)/2$ vertices from the arms assigned to the larger side (for example, delete $(k-1)/2$ arbitrary vertices within those arms).
