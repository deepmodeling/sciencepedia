This is the path graph $P_8$.", "solution": "We analyze each option by (i) determining the independence number and (ii) counting the maximal independent sets of size three, using only the stated edges and standard facts about independent sets.\n\nOption A. Partition $V=A\\cup B$ with $A=\\{v_{1},v_{2},v_{3},v_{4},v_{5}\\}$ and $B=\\{v_{6},v_{7},v_{8}\\}$, and edges only $(v_{1},v_{6}),(v_{2},v_{6}),(v_{3},v_{7}),(v_{4},v_{7}),(v_{5},v_{8})$. There are no edges within $A$ and none within $B$.\n- Independence number: Since $A$ has no internal edges, $A$ itself is an independent set of size $5$, so $\\alpha\\geq 5$. For any independent set $I$, let $S=I\\cap B$. Then $I\\cap A\\subseteq A\\setminus N_{A}(S)$, where $N_{A}(S)$ is the set of neighbors of $S$ in $A$.

Maximality requires (i) for every $a\\in A\\setminus I$, its unique neighbor in $B$ must be in $I$ (otherwise $a$ could be added), and (ii) for every $b\\in B\\setminus I$, at least one of its neighbors in $A$ must lie in $I$ (otherwise $b$ could be added).

If instead $I$ contains $\\{v_{6},v_{8}\\}$, the $A$-vertex is in $\\{v_{3},v_{4}\\}$, leaving the other of $\\{v_{3},v_{4}\\}$ addable, so not maximal. Similarly, with $\\{v_{7},v_{8}\\}$ the remaining $\\{v_{1},v_{2}\\}$ yields an addable vertex, so not maximal.\n(iii) $k=1$: With only one $B$-vertex in $I$, one of $\\{v_{3},v_{4},v_{5}\\}$ stays outside $I$ without its corresponding neighbor in $B$ present, so it is addable; not maximal.\n(iv) $k=0$: Any $3$-subset of $A$ leaves other $A$-vertices addable (no $A$-$A$ edges), so not maximal.\nHence there are exactly two maximal independent sets of size $3$, namely $\\{v_{6},v_{7},v_{8}\\}$ and $\\{v_{5},v_{6},v_{7}\\}$. Therefore A does not have exactly one such set (it has two).\n\nOption B. $K_{3,5}$ with parts $A=\\{v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}\\}$ and $B=\\{v_{4},v_{5},v_{6},v_{7},v_{8}\\}$.\n- In a complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$, every independent set lies entirely in one part. Thus the largest independent sets are the whole larger part; here $\\alpha=5$ (take $B$).\n- Size-$3$ independent sets are either $A$ itself or $3$-subsets of $B$. Any $3$-subset of $B$ is not maximal because it can be enlarged within $B$ (no $B$-$B$ edges). The set $A$ is independent and cannot be enlarged because every vertex of $B$ is adjacent to every vertex of $A$. Therefore there is exactly one maximal independent set of size $3$, namely $A$, and the maximum independent set has size $5$.\n\nOption C. Disjoint union $C_3 \\sqcup C_5$. For cycles, $\\alpha(C_n)=\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor$.

Path $P_8$. For paths, $\\alpha(P_n)=\\lceil n/2\\rceil$, so $\\alpha(P_8)=\\lceil 8/2\\rceil=4 \\neq 5$.
