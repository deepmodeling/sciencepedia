By calculating these values for a path graph, you will gain direct experience with how abstract graph properties can quantify practical needs like minimum sensor coverage and the complexity of data analysis.", "problem": "Consider a long, straight pipeline that is divided into $n$ discrete segments, indexed from 1 to $n$. A security company needs to place sensors to monitor the entire pipeline. A sensor placed on segment $i$ can monitor segment $i$ itself, as well as its immediate neighbors (segment $i-1$ and segment $i+1$, if they exist). The goal is to use the minimum number of sensors required to ensure every segment is monitored. This minimum number is called the *domination number* of the system.\n\nSeparately, a data processing system analyzes the sensor data. The structure of the pipeline can be analyzed using a concept called path decomposition. Abstractly, let the pipeline be represented by a path graph $P_n$ with vertices $V = \\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n\\}$ and edges connecting adjacent segments. A *path decomposition* of this graph is a sequence of vertex subsets $(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_t)$, called bags, satisfying three properties:\n1. The union of all subsets $X_i$ covers all vertices $V$.\n2. For every edge $\\{v_i, v_{i+1}\\}$ in the graph, there is some subset $X_j$ that contains both $v_i$ and $v_{i+1}$.\n3. For any vertex $v_k$, the subsets containing $v_k$ form a contiguous interval in the sequence.\n\nThe *width* of such a decomposition is the size of the largest subset minus one, i.e., $\\max_i |X_i| - 1$. The *pathwidth* of the graph is the minimum possible width over all valid path decompositions.\n\nAssume the pipeline consists of $n=17$ segments. Calculate two values:\n1. The domination number for the pipeline of 17 segments.\n2. The pathwidth of the corresponding graph $P_{17}$.\n\nPresent your two answers, the domination number and the pathwidth, in that order, as a pair of integers.", "solution": "We model the pipeline with the path graph $P_{n}$ on vertices $v_{1},\\dots,v_{n}$ and edges $\\{v_{i},v_{i+1}\\}$ for $i=1,\\dots,n-1$.\n\nFirst, the domination number. A dominating set $D \\subseteq V$ is a set of vertices such that every vertex of $P_{n}$ is either in $D$ or adjacent to a vertex in $D$. On a path, any single chosen vertex can dominate at most three vertices (itself and up to two neighbors), so any dominating set $D$ must satisfy\n$$\n3|D| \\geq n \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad |D| \\geq \\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{3} \\right\\rceil.\n$$\nThus $\\gamma(P_{n}) \\geq \\lceil n/3 \\rceil$. For $n=17$, we obtain $\\gamma(P_{17}) \\geq \\left\\lceil \\frac{17}{3} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil 5 + \\frac{2}{3} \\right\\rceil = 6$. To show this lower bound is tight, we exhibit an explicit dominating set of size $6$: take\n$$\nD=\\{v_{2},v_{5},v_{8},v_{11},v_{14},v_{17}\\}.\n$$\nEach chosen $v_{k}$ dominates $v_{k-1},v_{k},v_{k+1}$ where they exist, and a direct check shows all vertices $v_{1},\\dots,v_{17}$ are dominated. Hence $\\gamma(P_{17}) \\leq 6$, so $\\gamma(P_{17})=6$.\n\nSecond, the pathwidth. A path decomposition of $P_{17}$ is given by the sequence of bags\n$$\nX_{i}=\\{v_{i},v_{i+1}\\} \\quad \\text{for } i=1,2,\\dots,16.\n$$\nThese bags cover all vertices, each edge $\\{v_{i},v_{i+1}\\}$ lies in $X_{i}$, and for each vertex $v_{k}$, the bags containing it are $X_{k-1}$ and $X_{k}$ (only $X_{1}$ for $k=1$ and only $X_{16}$ for $k=17$), which form a contiguous interval. The maximum bag size is $2$, so this decomposition has width $2-1=1$, giving $\\operatorname{pw}(P_{17}) \\leq 1$. A width $0$ decomposition would require all bags to have size $1$, which cannot contain both endpoints of any edge, contradicting the edge coverage requirement. Therefore $\\operatorname{pw}(P_{17}) \\geq 1$, and we conclude $\\operatorname{pw}(P_{17})=1$.\n\nThus, for $n=17$, the domination number is $6$ and the pathwidth is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 6 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1536494"}, {"introduction": "Building on our understanding of graph parameters, we now examine how different objectives lead to different optimization problems on the same underlying structure.

For a given graph $G=(V, E)$, the goal is to find a minimum-sized set of vertices $S \\subseteq V$ such that removing the vertices in $S$ from the graph results in a graph with no cycles (i.e., a forest). In the parameterized version of the problem, we are given a graph $G$ and an integer parameter $k$, and we ask if an FVS of size at most $k$ exists.\n\nA common data reduction technique used to simplify instances of the parameterized FVS problem involves processing long paths of vertices that all have a degree of 2. The simplification procedure is as follows:\nIdentify any simple path $P = (x, v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_L, y)$ where the $L$ internal vertices $v_1, \\dots, v_L$ each have a degree of exactly 2 in the current graph, while their neighbors on the path, the endpoints $x$ and $y$, do not. If the number of internal vertices $L$ is strictly greater than the parameter $k$, this path is replaced by a new simple path connecting $x$ and $y$ which contains exactly $k$ new internal vertices. This operation does not change the parameter $k$.\n\nSuppose you are given an initial instance $(G_0, k_0)$ where the budget is $k_0 = 7$.

The vertices $A$ and $B$ are the only vertices in $G_0$ with a degree other than 2.\n\nApply the simplification procedure described above exhaustively to the graph $G_0$. This process results in a final, smaller graph, $G_f$.

All internal vertices have degree $2$, while $A$ and $B$ do not (each has degree $3$).\n\nThe simplification rule states: for any simple path whose internal vertices all have degree $2$ and whose endpoints do not, if the number $L$ of internal vertices satisfies $L>k$, replace that path by a new simple path with exactly $k$ internal vertices. If $L\\leq k$, the path is left unchanged. Applying this exhaustively to each $P_{i}$ independently yields that the number of internal vertices on each path in the final graph $G_{f}$ is\n$$\nL_{i}^{f}=\\min(L_{i},k_{0}).\n$$\nThus,\n$$\nL_{1}^{f}=\\min(12,7)=7,\\quad L_{2}^{f}=\\min(9,7)=7,\\quad L_{3}^{f}=\\min(5,7)=5.\n$$\n\nThe total number of vertices in $G_{f}$ equals the two endpoints $A,B$ plus the internal vertices across all three paths:\n$$\n|V(G_{f})|=2+\\sum_{i=1}^{3}L_{i}^{f}=2+(7+7+5)=21.\n$$\nNo further applications of the rule are possible because each resulting path has at most $k_{0}$ internal vertices, and $A$ and $B$ remain of degree $3$, so the conditions for the rule are not newly created or altered.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{21}$$", "id": "1536524"}]}
