The pool of available researchers consists of 2 from the Physics department, 3 from the Chemistry department, and 4 from the Biology department.

Since edges exist only between different departments and there are $2$ from Physics, $3$ from Chemistry, and $4$ from Biology, $G$ is the complete tripartite graph $K_{2,3,4}$.\n\nA fully collaborative team is a clique. In a complete tripartite graph $K_{n_{1},n_{2},n_{3}}$, any clique can contain at most one vertex from each part because there are no edges within a part. Therefore, any clique in $K_{2,3,4}$ has size at most $3$. This upper bound is attained by selecting one researcher from each of the three departments, which yields a triangle since all chosen vertices lie in different parts and are pairwise adjacent. Hence the maximum clique size is\n$$\n\\omega(G)=3.\n$$\n\nA non-interfering set is an independent set. In $K_{2,3,4}$, any two vertices from different parts are adjacent, so an independent set cannot contain vertices from two different departments. Thus any independent set lies entirely within a single department, and its size is at most the largest part size. The Biology department has $4$ researchers, so taking all four Biology researchers yields an independent set of size $4$, which is maximal.
