The servers, named Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta, have different hardware architectures, leading to varying energy consumption for each job. The manager's goal is to create a one-to-one assignment of jobs to servers that minimizes the total energy consumption for running all four tasks. The four jobs are: a Quantum Simulation (QS), a Protein Folding simulation (PF), a Fluid Dynamics calculation (FD), and a Cryptographic Analysis (CA).\n\nThe projected energy consumption for each job-server pairing, in kilowatt-hours (kWh), is given in the following list.\n- **Server Alpha:** 10 kWh for QS, 12 kWh for PF, 19 kWh for FD, 11 kWh for CA.\n- **Server Beta:** 5 kWh for QS, 10 kWh for PF, 7 kWh for FD, 8 kWh for CA.\n- **Server Gamma:** 12 kWh for QS, 14 kWh for PF, 13 kWh for FD, 11 kWh for CA.\n- **Server Delta:** 8 kWh for QS, 15 kWh for PF, 11 kWh for FD, 9 kWh for CA.\n\nEach server must be assigned exactly one job, and each job must be run on exactly one server.

Let's fix the assignment for the QS (Quantum Simulation) job.\n\n*   **Case 1: Assign QS to Server Beta (Cost = 5 kWh).**\n    We must assign the remaining jobs {PF, FD, CA} to servers {Alpha, Gamma, Delta}.
