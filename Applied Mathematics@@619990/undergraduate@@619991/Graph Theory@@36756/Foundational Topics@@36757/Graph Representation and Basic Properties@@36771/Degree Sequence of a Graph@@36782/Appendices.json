We repeat this process until we arrive at a sequence that is trivially graphical (e.g., all zeros) or a sequence that is clearly not graphical (e.g., contains negative numbers or has a degree larger than the number of remaining vertices).\n\nWe also use a necessary condition for any graph: the sum of the degrees of all vertices must be an even number, as each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices.\n\nLet's analyze each option.\n\n**A.

This practice challenges you to think like a graph theorist, using the degree sequence alone to deduce structural features.

By Euler’s theorem for undirected graphs:\n- An Eulerian cycle exists if and only if every vertex has even degree and the graph is connected. Since there are odd degrees, no realization can have an Eulerian cycle, so B is false.\n- An Eulerian path exists if and only if the graph is connected and has exactly zero or two vertices of odd degree. We will show every realization is connected; combined with exactly two odd degrees, this implies D must be true.\n\nWe show that any realization is necessarily connected. In a simple graph, within any connected component of size $s$, every vertex has degree at most $s-1$. Since the sequence contains vertices of degree $4$, any component containing such a vertex must have size at least $5$. There are two vertices of degree $4$, and they cannot lie in different components (that would require at least $10$ vertices in total). Thus both degree-$4$ vertices lie in the same component of size at least $5$. With only $6$ vertices total, the remaining component, if any, would have at most one vertex, which would have degree $0$, contradicting the given degrees (all are at least $2$). Therefore any realization is connected. Since there are exactly two odd-degree vertices, every realization contains an Eulerian path. Hence D is true for all realizations.\n\nTo eliminate the remaining options:\n- A claims $G$ is disconnected. As shown, every realization is connected, so A is false.\n- C claims $G$ is bipartite. It is not necessary: for example, a connected realization can be constructed that contains a triangle (e.g., with edges forming a $3$-cycle among three vertices), so not every realization is bipartite. Thus C is false as a must statement.\n- F claims $G$ does not contain a cycle. Any acyclic graph with $n$ vertices has at most $n-1$ edges in each connected component; in particular, a connected acyclic graph on $6$ vertices has at most $5$ edges. Since every realization has $m=9>5$ edges and is connected, it must contain cycles. Hence F is false.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that must hold for every realization is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1495689"}, {"introduction": "A true expert not only knows how to use an algorithm but also understands its limitations.
