This topology is modeled as a simple, undirected graph called a path graph, $P_n$. In this graph, vertices represent the nodes and edges represent communication links. The connections are defined as follows: for any integer $i$ from $1$ to $n-1$, there is an edge connecting vertex $v_i$ and vertex $v_{i+1}$. There are no other edges. The network's structure is stored using an adjacency list representation, where for each vertex, a list of its directly connected neighbors is maintained.
