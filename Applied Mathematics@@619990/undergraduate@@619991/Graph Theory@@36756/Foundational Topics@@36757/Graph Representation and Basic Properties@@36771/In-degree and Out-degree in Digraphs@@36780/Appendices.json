This first practice introduces a foundational principle known as the handshaking lemma for digraphs, which states that the sum of all in-degrees must equal the sum of all out-degrees. By applying this simple yet powerful test [@problem_id:1513062], you'll learn a critical first step in validating any proposed graph specification.", "problem": "A team of engineers is designing the communication architecture for a new distributed system consisting of five specialized Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents. The flow of information between these agents can be modeled as a directed graph where the agents are the vertices and a directed edge from agent $u$ to agent $v$ signifies that agent $u$ sends data directly to agent $v$. To prevent feedback loops and redundant data channels, the proposed architecture must adhere to two rules: an agent cannot send data to itself, and there can be at most one directed data channel from any agent $u$ to any other agent $v$.\n\nA system architect proposes a design specification. In this specification, the sequence of the number of incoming data channels for the five agents (their in-degrees) is $(3, 2, 1, 1, 1)$. The sequence of the number of outgoing data channels for the five agents (their out-degrees) is $(2, 2, 1, 1, 1)$. Note that the sequences represent the set of degrees, not the degrees of specific agents in any particular order.\n\nIs it possible to construct a communication network that satisfies this design specification?\n\nA. Yes, such a network is possible.\nB. No, because the sum of the in-degrees is not equal to the sum of the out-degrees.\nC. No, because the maximum proposed in-degree (3) is too large for a network of five agents.\nD. No, because it is impossible to construct a graph with this specific combination of degrees, even though the sums are equal.\nE.
