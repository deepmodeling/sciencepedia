It consists of a set of vertices (or nodes) and a set of edges that connect pairs of vertices. The *degree* of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.

There are no edges connecting two vertices within the same set. A special type of bipartite graph is a *complete bipartite graph*, where every vertex in set $U$ is connected to every vertex in set $V$.
