This problem illustrates the fundamental relationship between a local property of a graph—the degree of each vertex—and a global property—the total number of edges. By working through a scenario involving a regularly structured network, you will see how this simple yet powerful formula allows us to determine the total size of the network from purely local information [@problem_id:1377860].", "problem": "A team of network engineers is tasked with designing a small-scale, decentralized communication network for a research facility. The facility consists of 12 servers, and the network topology must adhere to a specific redundancy protocol. According to the protocol, each server must be connected by a dedicated, bidirectional data cable to exactly 4 other distinct servers. To procure the necessary materials, the team needs to determine the total number of individual data cables required to construct this network. What is this total number?", "solution": "Let's model the communication network as a simple graph $G = (V, E)$, where the set of vertices $V$ represents the 12 servers and the set of edges $E$ represents the bidirectional data cables connecting them.\n\nThe number of vertices in our graph is the number of servers, so $|V| = 12$.\nAn edge $\\{u, v\\}$ exists in $E$ if and only if there is a data cable connecting server $u$ and server $v$. The problem states these are individual, bidirectional cables, which corresponds to the standard definition of an edge in an undirected graph.\n\nThe degree of a vertex, denoted $\\deg(v)$, is the number of edges incident to it. In the context of this problem, the degree of a server is the number of other servers it is connected to. The problem specification states that each server must be connected to exactly 4 other distinct servers. This means that the degree of every vertex in the graph is 4.\nSo, for every vertex $v \\in V$, we have $\\deg(v) = 4$.\n\nTo find the total number of edges (cables), we can use the Handshaking Theorem (also known as the degree sum formula). This theorem states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges.\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\sum_{v \\in V} \\deg(v) = 2 |E| $$\n\nWe can calculate the sum of the degrees for our graph. Since there are 12 vertices and each vertex has a degree of 4, the sum is:\n$$ \\sum_{v \\in V} \\deg(v) = 12 \\times 4 = 48 $$\n\nNow, we substitute this sum back into the Handshaking Theorem equation:\n$$ 48 = 2 |E| $$\n\nTo find the number of edges, $|E|$, we solve for it:\n$$ |E| = \\frac{48}{2} $$\n$$ |E| = 24 $$\n\nTherefore, the total number of individual data cables required is 24.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{24}$$", "id": "1377860"}, {"introduction": "Moving from calculation to validation, this next practice demonstrates the power of the Degree Sum Formula as a critical tool for verification. A famous corollary of the formula states that the sum of degrees in any graph must be an even number. This problem asks you to use this property as a quick and effective \"impossibility test\" to determine whether a proposed network design is theoretically feasible before any resources are committed [@problem_id:1539823].", "problem": "A group of nine research institutions are collaborating on a project and decide to build a dedicated, private data network to connect their computer systems. This network can be modeled as a simple graph, where each institution is a vertex and a direct fiber-optic link between two institutions is an edge.

Therefore, it is not possible to construct such a network.\n\nAs an additional check, applying the Havel–Hakimi process also fails: removing the vertex of degree $8$ forces subtracting $1$ from each of the remaining degrees, yielding $6,5,4,3,2,1,0,0$, and the next step with leading $6$ requires reducing six entries including a $0$, producing a negative degree, which is impossible. This corroborates the impossibility.\n\nThus the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1539823"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice challenges you to look beyond simple arithmetic and engage in deeper logical reasoning about graph structures. While the evenness of the degree sum is a necessary condition, it is not always sufficient to guarantee a graph's existence.
