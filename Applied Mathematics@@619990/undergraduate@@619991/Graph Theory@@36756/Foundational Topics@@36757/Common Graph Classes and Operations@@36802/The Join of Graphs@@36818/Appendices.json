The problem assumes $V_1$ and $V_2$ are disjoint. Let $G = G_1 + G_2$ be the join of these two graphs. The vertex set of $G$ is $V = V_1 \\cup V_2$.\n\nFor the graph $G$ to be a complete graph, every pair of distinct vertices in $V$ must be connected by an edge. Let's analyze this condition by considering any two distinct vertices, $u$ and $v$, from $V$. We have three possible cases for the locations of $u$ and $v$.\n\nCase 1: Both vertices are in $G_1$ (i.e., $u, v \\in V_1$).\nFor $G$ to be a complete graph, there must be an edge between $u$ and $v$. By the definition of the join operation, the edges between any two vertices from $V_1$ in the resulting graph $G$ are exactly the edges originally present in $G_1$. The join operation does not add any edges between vertices that are both in $V_1$. Therefore, for any pair of distinct vertices $u, v \\in V_1$, the edge $\\{u, v\\}$ must be in $E_1$. This is precisely the definition of $G_1$ being a complete graph. Thus, a necessary condition for $G_1+G_2$ to be complete is that $G_1$ must be complete.\n\nCase 2: Both vertices are in $G_2$ (i.e., $u, v \\in V_2$).\nBy the same logic as in Case 1, for $G$ to be a complete graph, any pair of distinct vertices $u, v \\in V_2$ must be connected by an edge in $G$. The edges between vertices in $V_2$ are defined solely by the edge set $E_2$ of the original graph $G_2$. Therefore, for every pair of distinct vertices $u, v \\in V_2$, the edge $\\{u, v\\}$ must be in $E_2$. This means $G_2$ must also be a complete graph. This is another necessary condition.\n\nCase 3: One vertex is in $G_1$ and the other is in $G_2$ (i.e., $u \\in V_1$ and $v \\in V_2$).\nBy the definition of the join operation $G_1 + G_2$, an edge is added between every vertex of $G_1$ and every vertex of $G_2$. Therefore, for any $u \\in V_1$ and $v \\in V_2$, the edge $\\{u, v\\}$ is guaranteed to exist in $G$. This condition is always satisfied by the construction of the join.\n\nCombining the necessary conditions from all three cases, we find that for $G_1 + G_2$ to be a complete graph, both $G_1$ and $G_2$ must be complete graphs.\n\nNow, we check for sufficiency. Assume $G_1$ is a complete graph on $|V_1| = n_1$ vertices, and $G_2$ is a complete graph on $|V_2| = n_2$ vertices. Let's consider an arbitrary pair of distinct vertices $u, v$ from the join $G = G_1 + G_2$.\n- If $u, v \\in V_1$, an edge $\\{u, v\\}$ exists because $G_1$ is complete.\n- If $u, v \\in V_2$, an edge $\\{u, v\\}$ exists because $G_2$ is complete.\n- If $u \\in V_1$ and $v \\in V_2$, an edge $\\{u, v\\}$ exists by the definition of the join.\nSince an edge exists between any pair of distinct vertices, the join graph $G$ is a complete graph on $n_1 + n_2$ vertices.\n\nThus, the condition that both $G_1$ and $G_2$ must be complete graphs is both necessary and sufficient for their join $G_1 + G_2$ to be a complete graph.
