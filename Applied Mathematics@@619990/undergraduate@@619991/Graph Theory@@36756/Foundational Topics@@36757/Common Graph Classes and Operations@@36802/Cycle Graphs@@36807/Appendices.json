This practice will sharpen your analytical skills by asking you to distinguish a cycle graph from another graph that shares the same number of vertices, edges, and identical vertex degrees. By comparing fundamental graph invariants like connectivity and diameter, you will learn which properties truly define a graph's unique structure [@problem_id:1494182].", "problem": "In graph theory, two graphs are considered isomorphic if they are structurally identical, meaning there exists a one-to-one correspondence (a bijection) between their vertex sets that preserves adjacency. If two graphs are isomorphic, they must share all their structural properties, known as graph invariants. These invariants include properties like the number of vertices, number of edges, degree sequence, and connectivity.\n\nConsider two simple, undirected graphs, $G_1$ and $G_2$.\nThe first graph, $G_1$, is the cycle graph on 8 vertices, commonly denoted as $C_8$. This graph consists of 8 vertices arranged in a single closed loop.\nThe second graph, $G_2$, is the graph formed by two separate, disjoint copies of the cycle graph on 4 vertices. This graph is often denoted as $2C_4$.\n\nWhile $G_1$ and $G_2$ are not isomorphic, several of their basic properties are identical. Your task is to identify which of the following graph properties can be used to definitively prove that $G_1$ and $G_2$ are not isomorphic. Select all valid options.\n\nA.

The diameter of the graph (the maximum shortest-path distance between any pair of vertices).\n\nF. The length of the longest simple path in the graph.", "solution": "To determine which properties distinguish the graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, we must calculate the value of each listed property for both graphs and compare them. Two graphs can only be isomorphic if all their graph invariants are identical. Therefore, any property that yields a different value for $G_1$ and $G_2$ serves as proof of their non-isomorphism.\n\nLet's first analyze the properties of $G_1$, the cycle graph $C_8$.\n- **A. Number of vertices:** By definition, $C_8$ has 8 vertices.\n- **B. Number of edges:** In a cycle graph $C_n$, the number of edges is equal to the number of vertices. Thus, $C_8$ has 8 edges.\n- **C. Degree sequence:** Every vertex in $C_8$ is connected to exactly two other vertices (its neighbors in the cycle). Therefore, every vertex has a degree of 2. The degree sequence for $G_1$ is $(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)$.\n- **D. Number of connected components:** $C_8$ is a single, connected loop. Thus, it has 1 connected component.\n- **E. Diameter:** The diameter is the greatest distance between any pair of vertices. In $C_n$, the diameter is $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$. For $C_8$, the diameter is $\\lfloor 8/2 \\rfloor = 4$.\n- **F. Length of the longest simple path:** A simple path does not repeat vertices. The longest simple path in $C_8$ involves traversing 7 edges to connect all 8 vertices. For example, a path from vertex $v_1$ to $v_8$ without closing the loop would be $v_1 \\to v_2 \\to \\dots \\to v_8$. This path has length $8-1=7$.\n\nNext, let's analyze the properties of $G_2$, the graph consisting of two disjoint copies of $C_4$. Let's call these two components $H_1$ and $H_2$. Both $H_1$ and $H_2$ are isomorphic to $C_4$.\n- **A. Number of vertices:** Each $C_4$ component has 4 vertices. The total number of vertices in $G_2$ is $4 + 4 = 8$.\n- **B. Number of edges:** Each $C_4$ component has 4 edges. The total number of edges in $G_2$ is $4 + 4 = 8$.\n- **C. Degree sequence:** In each $C_4$ component, every vertex has a degree of 2. Since $G_2$ is composed of these two components, all 8 of its vertices have a degree of 2. The degree sequence for $G_2$ is $(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)$.\n- **D. Number of connected components:** By its definition, $G_2$ consists of two separate, non-connected graphs ($H_1$ and $H_2$). Thus, it has 2 connected components.\n- **E. Diameter:** Since the graph is not connected, there is no path between a vertex in $H_1$ and a vertex in $H_2$. By convention, the distance between such vertices is considered infinite. Therefore, the diameter of $G_2$ is infinite.\n- **F. Length of the longest simple path:** The longest simple path in $G_2$ must be contained entirely within one of its components. The longest simple path in a $C_4$ uses all 4 vertices, which corresponds to a path of length $4 - 1 = 3$.\n\nNow we compare the properties for $G_1$ and $G_2$:\n- **A. Number of vertices:** $8$ for $G_1$ and $8$ for $G_2$. This is the same.\n- **B. Number of edges:** $8$ for $G_1$ and $8$ for $G_2$. This is the same.\n- **C. Degree sequence:** $(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)$ for both. This is the same.\n- **D. Number of connected components:** $1$ for $G_1$ and $2$ for $G_2$. This is different.\n- **E. Diameter:** $4$ for $G_1$ and $\\infty$ for $G_2$. This is different.\n- **F. Length of the longest simple path:** $7$ for $G_1$ and $3$ for $G_2$. This is different.\n\nThe properties that have different values for $G_1$ and $G_2$ are the number of connected components, the diameter, and the length of the longest simple path. Therefore, options D, E, and F are the correct choices as they can be used to prove the graphs are not isomorphic.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{DEF}$$", "id": "1494182"}, {"introduction": "Graph transformations allow us to view structures from new perspectives and uncover surprising relationships.

One such transformation is the line graph. For a given simple graph $G$, its line graph, denoted $L(G)$, is a graph constructed as follows: each vertex of $L(G)$ corresponds to an edge of $G$, and two vertices in $L(G)$ are adjacent if and only if their corresponding edges in $G$ share a common vertex.\n\nAnother fundamental concept is that of a spanning tree. A spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph is a subgraph that includes all the vertices of the original graph and is a tree (i.e., it is connected and has no cycles).\n\nConsider the cycle graph $C_n$, which is a graph on $n \\ge 3$ vertices $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n$ with edges connecting $v_i$ to $v_{i+1}$ for $i=1, \\dots, n-1$, and an edge connecting $v_n$ to $v_1$.\n\nDetermine the total number of distinct spanning trees in the line graph of the cycle graph $C_{37}$.", "solution": "Let $C_{n}$ be the cycle on vertices $v_{1},\\dots,v_{n}$ with edges $e_{i}=\\{v_{i},v_{i+1}\\}$ for $i=1,\\dots,n-1$ and $e_{n}=\\{v_{n},v_{1}\\}$, with indices understood modulo $n$. In the line graph construction, each edge $e_{i}$ of $C_{n}$ becomes a vertex $u_{i}$ of $L(C_{n})$, and two vertices $u_{i}$ and $u_{j}$ in $L(C_{n})$ are adjacent if and only if $e_{i}$ and $e_{j}$ share a common endpoint in $C_{n}$. In $C_{n}$, each edge $e_{i}$ meets exactly the two edges $e_{i-1}$ and $e_{i+1}$ (indices modulo $n$). Therefore, in $L(C_{n})$ each $u_{i}$ is adjacent exactly to $u_{i-1}$ and $u_{i+1}$, which shows that\n$$\nL(C_{n}) \\cong C_{n}.\n$$\n\nTo count spanning trees, recall that a spanning tree on $n$ vertices has exactly $n-1$ edges, and $C_{n}$ has $n$ edges arranged in a single cycle. Removing any one edge from $C_{n}$ breaks the unique cycle and yields a connected, acyclic subgraph on all $n$ vertices, i.e., a spanning tree. Conversely, any spanning tree of $C_{n}$ must be obtained by deleting exactly one edge, since adding any edge back would recreate a cycle.
