This first exercise [@problem_id:1484033] guides you through partitioning the vertices of a specific graph, the 3-dimensional hypercube $Q_3$. By classifying vertices based on a simple property of their binary labels, you will directly construct the two sets of the bipartition, making the abstract definition of bipartiteness a concrete and tangible reality.", "problem": "Consider a graph $G$ whose set of vertices $V$ consists of all possible 3-bit binary strings (e.g., '000', '010', '111'). An edge exists between any two vertices in $V$ if and only if their corresponding binary strings differ in exactly one position. For example, an edge connects '011' and '111' because they differ only in the first bit, but no edge connects '001' and '111' as they differ in two bits.\n\nWe wish to partition the vertex set $V$ into two non-empty, disjoint sets, $A$ and $B$, such that $A \\cup B = V$ and $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$. This partition must satisfy the property that no two vertices within set $A$ are connected by an edge, and similarly, no two vertices within set $B$ are connected by an edge.\n\nGiven that the vertex '000' must belong to set $A$, determine the sum of the decimal interpretations of all the binary strings that constitute set $A$. For example, the binary string '101' is interpreted as the decimal number $1 \\times 2^2 + 0 \\times 2^1 + 1 \\times 2^0 = 5$. Your final answer should be a single integer.", "solution": "Let $V=\\{0,1\\}^{3}$ and let two vertices be adjacent if their Hamming distance is $1$. This is the 3-dimensional hypercube $Q_{3}$. The requirement that no two vertices within $A$ are adjacent and no two within $B$ are adjacent means that $(A,B)$ is a proper $2$-coloring of $G$, i.e., a bipartition into independent sets.\n\nIn $Q_{3}$, flipping one bit changes the Hamming weight parity. Therefore, if we define the Hamming weight $w(x)$ of a vertex $x=b_{2}b_{1}b_{0}$ by $w(x)=b_{2}+b_{1}+b_{0}$, then every edge connects a vertex of even $w$ to one of odd $w$. Hence the sets\n$$\nS_{\\text{even}}=\\{x\\in V:\\, w(x)\\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}\\},\\qquad S_{\\text{odd}}=\\{x\\in V:\\, w(x)\\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}\\}\n$$\nform a valid bipartition. Moreover, since $Q_{3}$ is connected, any proper $2$-coloring is unique up to swapping the two color classes. With the constraint that $000\\in A$ and noting that $w(000)=0$ is even, it follows that $A=S_{\\text{even}}$.\n\nThus $A$ consists of all $3$-bit strings with even Hamming weight, namely\n$$\nA=\\{000,011,101,110\\}.\n$$\nInterpreting $b_{2}b_{1}b_{0}$ in decimal as $b_{2}2^{2}+b_{1}2^{1}+b_{0}2^{0}$, we compute the values:\n$$\n000\\mapsto 0,\\quad 011\\mapsto 0\\cdot 2^{2}+1\\cdot 2^{1}+1\\cdot 2^{0}=3,\\quad 101\\mapsto 1\\cdot 2^{2}+0\\cdot 2^{1}+1\\cdot 2^{0}=5,\\quad 110\\mapsto 1\\cdot 2^{2}+1\\cdot 2^{1}+0\\cdot 2^{0}=6.\n$$\nTherefore, the required sum is\n$$\n0+3+5+6=14.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{14}$$", "id": "1484033"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond direct construction, we can often deduce a graph's properties from numerical data alone.

This is impossible.\n\n- If $(m,n)=(2,3)$, then any bipartite graph on these parts satisfies $E \\le mn = 6$, with equality if and only if the graph is complete bipartite. Since $E=6$, equality holds and the graph must be $K_{2,3}$.
