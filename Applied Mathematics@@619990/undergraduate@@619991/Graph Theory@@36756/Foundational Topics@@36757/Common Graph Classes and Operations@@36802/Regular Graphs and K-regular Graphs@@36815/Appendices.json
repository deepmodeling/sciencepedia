A complete graph on $n$ vertices, $K_{n}$, has every pair of distinct vertices adjacent, so each vertex has degree $n-1$. A counterexample to the claim must be $k$-regular for some $k$ but not complete.\n\nConsider $C_{6}$. In any cycle $C_{n}$ with $n \\geq 3$, each vertex is adjacent to exactly two neighbors, so $C_{6}$ is $2$-regular. However, $K_{6}$ would require each vertex to have degree $5$ and edges between every pair of distinct vertices. Since $C_{6}$ has missing edges (no chords), it is not complete. Thus $C_{6}$ is a counterexample.\n\nConsider $K_{5}$. By definition $K_{5}$ is complete and $4$-regular. Since it is complete, it does not contradict the claim; it is not a counterexample.\n\nConsider $K_{3,3}$. In a complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$, each vertex in the part of size $m$ is adjacent to all $n$ vertices in the other part, and vice versa, with no edges within a part. Therefore in $K_{3,3}$, every vertex has degree $3$, so it is $3$-regular. It is not complete on $6$ vertices because vertices within the same part are nonadjacent. Hence $K_{3,3}$ is a counterexample.\n\nConsider the disjoint union of two copies of $K_{3}$. Within each $K_{3}$, every vertex has degree $2$, and there are no edges between the two components. Therefore every vertex in the whole graph has degree $2$, so the graph is $2$-regular. It is not complete on $6$ vertices because there exist vertices in different components with no edge between them (and also because degrees would have to be $5$ in $K_{6}$). Hence it is a counterexample.\n\nConsider $K_{2}$. It is complete and $1$-regular.
