Two different network communication protocols, Protocol 1 and Protocol 2, are being considered. Each protocol defines a set of direct, bidirectional connections (edges) between pairs of servers (vertices). The overall set of servers is $V = \\{a, b, c, d, e, f\\}$.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, we will use the following standard graph theory definitions:\n- A graph $G=(V, E)$ consists of a set of vertices $V$ and a set of edges $E$, where each edge is an unordered pair of distinct vertices.\n- A graph is a **complete bipartite graph**, denoted $K_{m,n}$, if its vertex set can be partitioned into two disjoint sets, say $P_1$ with $m$ vertices and $P_2$ with $n$ vertices, such that an edge exists between two vertices if and only if one vertex is in $P_1$ and the other is in $P_2$.\n- The **intersection** of two graphs $G_1 = (V, E_1)$ and $G_2 = (V, E_2)$ on the same vertex set $V$ is the graph $G_{int} = (V, E_1 \\cap E_2)$. The edges of $G_{int}$ are precisely those edges that exist in *both* $G_1$ and $G_2$.\n\nThe network defined by Protocol 1, let's call it graph $G_1$, is a complete bipartite graph $K_{3,3}$. The vertex set $V$ is partitioned into the two sets $A_1 = \\{a, b, c\\}$ and $B_1 = \\{d, e, f\\}$.\n\nThe network defined by Protocol 2, let's call it graph $G_2$, is a complete bipartite graph $K_{2,4}$. The vertex set $V$ is partitioned into the two sets $A_2 = \\{a, d\\}$ and $B_2 = \\{b, c, e, f\\}$.\n\nYour task is to determine the total number of connections that are common to both protocols.
