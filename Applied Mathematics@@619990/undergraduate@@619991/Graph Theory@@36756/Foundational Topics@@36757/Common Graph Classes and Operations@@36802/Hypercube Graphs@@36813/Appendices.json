In $Q_{3}$ each vertex has degree $3$, so for any vertex $v$ with neighbor set $N(v)$, the number of unordered pairs of distinct neighbors is\n$$\n\\binom{|N(v)|}{2}=\\binom{3}{2}=3.\n$$\nWe must verify that any two distinct neighbors $x,y\\in N(v)$ are not adjacent, so that the three vertices $\\{x,v,y\\}$ do indeed form a $P_{3}$. In the hypercube, adjacency corresponds to Hamming distance $1$. If $x$ and $y$ are distinct neighbors of $v$, then $x$ differs from $v$ in exactly one coordinate, say $i$, and $y$ differs from $v$ in exactly one (possibly different) coordinate, say $j$. Since $x\\neq y$, we must have $i\\neq j$, so $x$ and $y$ differ from each other in exactly the two coordinates $i$ and $j$, hence their Hamming distance is $2$, and they are not adjacent. Therefore, each unordered pair $\\{x,y\\}\\subset N(v)$ together with $v$ induces a copy of $P_{3}$ with $v$ as the middle vertex.\n\nSince $Q_{3}$ has $8$ vertices, the total number of such subgraphs is\n$$\n\\sum_{v\\in V(Q_{3})}\\binom{3}{2}=8\\cdot 3=24.\n$$\nEach $P_{3}$ is counted exactly once because it has a unique middle vertex (the unique vertex of degree $2$ in the path).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{24}$$", "id": "1512648"}, {"introduction": "We now shift our focus from local counting to a profound global property of all hypercube graphs: bipartiteness. This exercise presents a thought experiment to deepen your understanding of this feature by exploring the consequences of breaking it [@problem_id:1512645].

The addition of the edge $(u, v)$ creates exactly one new cycle in the graph.", "solution": "We recall that $Q_{n}$ is bipartite with a fixed bipartition given by parity of Hamming weight: let $X$ be the set of vertices with even Hamming weight and $Y$ be those with odd Hamming weight. Every edge of $Q_{n}$ changes exactly one bit, hence changes parity, so all edges go between $X$ and $Y$. Therefore any path between two vertices in the same part has even length, and any cycle in $Q_{n}$ has even length.\n\nLet $u,v \\in V(Q_{n})$ with shortest path distance $2$. Then $u$ and $v$ differ in exactly two coordinates, which implies they have the same parity, hence $u,v \\in X$ or $u,v \\in Y$.\n\nConsider the effect of adding the new edge $(u,v)$:\n- For A and B: Since $(u,v)$ connects two vertices in the same part, the resulting graph $G'$ contains an edge within a part, so it is no longer bipartite. Consequently, the chromatic number of $G'$ is not $2$. Thus A and B are false.\n- For D: $Q_{n}$ is $n$-regular. Adding the edge $(u,v)$ increases the degrees of $u$ and $v$ from $n$ to $n+1$, but all other vertices retain degree $n$. Hence the minimum degree in $G'$ is still $n$, not $n+1$. Thus D is false.\n- For E: Since $u$ and $v$ differ in exactly two coordinates, there are exactly two distinct vertices $w_{1}, w_{2}$ each adjacent to both $u$ and $v$, giving two distinct $u$–$v$ paths of length $2$. Adding $(u,v)$ creates at least two distinct $3$-cycles $u$–$w_{1}$–$v$–$u$ and $u$–$w_{2}$–$v$–$u$, and in fact additional cycles from longer even-length $u$–$v$ paths. Hence not exactly one new cycle is created. Thus E is false.\n- For C: Any cycle in $G'$ that contains the new edge $(u,v)$ can be decomposed as the edge $(u,v)$ plus a $v$–$u$ path entirely within $Q_{n}$. Because $u$ and $v$ lie in the same part of the bipartition of $Q_{n}$, every $u$–$v$ path in $Q_{n}$ has even length, say $2k$ for some integer $k \\geq 1$. Therefore, the total cycle length equals $1+2k$, which is odd. Conversely, every $u$–$v$ path in $Q_{n}$ yields such an odd cycle when combined with the new edge. Hence all cycles in $G'$ that include $(u,v)$ have odd length. Thus C is true.\n\nTherefore, the statement that always holds is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1512645"}, {"introduction": "This final practice connects the local property of vertex degree, which is constant throughout a hypercube, to a significant global traversal problem.
