One such transformation is the construction of a line graph. Given a simple undirected graph $G$, its line graph, denoted $L(G)$, is a graph where each vertex of $L(G)$ represents an edge of $G$. Two vertices in $L(G)$ are connected by an edge if and only if their corresponding edges in $G$ share a common vertex.\n\nConsider two specific simple graphs:\n1.

Thus the four edges of $G$ are pairwise incident.\n\nWe now characterize simple graphs that contain a set of at least four pairwise incident edges. In a simple graph, a set of pairwise incident edges either:\n- all meet at a single common vertex (a star centered at that vertex), or\n- forms exactly the three edges of a triangle $K_{3}$.\n\nThe triangle case has size three, so it cannot occur for four edges. Hence any set of four pairwise incident edges in a simple graph must all meet at a single common vertex. Therefore all four edges of $G$ are incident to a single vertex, and since $G$ is connected and simple with exactly four edges, $G$ must be the star $K_{1,4}$.\n\nFinally, verify directly that $L(K_{1,4})=K_{4}$: the four edges of $K_{1,4}$ all share the center, so in the line graph the four corresponding vertices are all mutually adjacent, yielding $K_{4}$.
