The network topology is designed as a wheel graph, denoted $W_5$. In this structure, one node acts as a central hub, and the remaining nodes are arranged in a cycle, with the hub connected to every node on the cycle.\n\nFor this specific network, node 1 is designated as the central hub. The remaining nodes (2, 3, 4, 5) form the outer cycle. The connections on the cycle are as follows: node 2 is connected to node 3, node 3 is connected to node 4, node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 5 is connected back to node 2, completing the cycle.\n\nAll connections in the network are bidirectional, meaning the graph is undirected. We also assume there are no self-loops (i.e., no node is connected to itself). Construct the adjacency matrix $A$ for this network. The rows and columns of the matrix should correspond to the nodes in ascending numerical order (e.g., row 1 and column 1 correspond to node 1). The entries of the adjacency matrix, $A_{ij}$, are defined as 1 if an edge exists between node $i$ and node $j$, and 0 otherwise.", "solution": "By definition, the adjacency matrix $A$ of a simple undirected graph has entries $A_{ij}=1$ if there is an edge between nodes $i$ and $j$, and $A_{ij}=0$ otherwise.

A 4-cycle involving $c$ must be of the form $c-v_i-v_j-v_k-c$ for some distinct rim vertices $v_i, v_j, v_k$. For the edges $(v_i,v_j)$ and $(v_j,v_k)$ to exist on the rim, these three vertices must be consecutive on the cycle $C_n$.\n\nThus, each 4-cycle is formed by the central vertex $c$ and a path of length 2 on the outer cycle. A path of length 2 involves three consecutive vertices, for instance $(v_i, v_{i+1}, v_{i+2})$ (with indices taken modulo $n$). This set of three vertices, together with the hub $c$, forms exactly one 4-cycle: $c-v_i-v_{i+1}-v_{i+2}-c$.\n\nThe number of such 4-cycles is equal to the number of paths of length 2 on the cycle $C_n$.
