Two graphs cannot be isomorphic if they have different degree sequences. We will analyze each pair based on these properties.\n\n**Analysis of Pair A**\n- $G_A$ has the edge set $\\{(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6)\\}$. It has 5 edges. The graph forms a single path connecting all vertices, so it is connected. Thus, $G_A$ is a tree (specifically, the path graph $P_6$). The degrees of its vertices are $d(1)=1$, $d(6)=1$, and $d(2)=d(3)=d(4)=d(5)=2$. The sorted degree sequence is $(1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2)$.\n- $G_B$ has the edge set $\\{(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\\}$. It has 5 edges. Vertex 1 is connected to all other vertices, so the graph is connected. Thus, $G_B$ is a tree (specifically, the star graph $K_{1,5}$). The degrees of its vertices are $d(1)=5$ and $d(2)=d(3)=d(4)=d(5)=d(6)=1$. The sorted degree sequence is $(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5)$.\n- **Isomorphism Check:** The degree sequence of $G_A$ is $(1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2)$ and the degree sequence of $G_B$ is $(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5)$. Since their degree sequences are different, the graphs are not isomorphic.\n- **Conclusion:** Both are trees, and they are not isomorphic. This pair matches the required conditions.\n\n**Analysis of Pair B**\n- $G_A$ has the edge set $\\{(1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6)\\}$. It has 5 edges. It is connected, for instance, via the path $1-4-5-6$. Therefore, $G_A$ is a tree. The degrees are $d(1)=1, d(2)=1, d(3)=1, d(6)=1, d(5)=2, d(4)=4$. The sorted degree sequence is $(1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4)$.\n- $G_B$ has the edge set $\\{(1,2), (3,2), (4,2), (2,5), (5,6)\\}$. It has 5 edges. It is connected, for instance, via the path $1-2-5-6$. Therefore, $G_B$ is a tree. The degrees are $d(1)=1, d(3)=1, d(4)=1, d(6)=1, d(5)=2, d(2)=4$. The sorted degree sequence is $(1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4)$.\n- **Isomorphism Check:** Both graphs have the same degree sequence. This does not guarantee isomorphism, but suggests it's possible. Let's try to construct an isomorphism $f:V_A \\to V_B$. The vertices of degree 4 must map to each other, so $f(4)=2$. The vertex of degree 2 must map to the vertex of degree 2, so $f(5)=5$. The neighbor of the degree-2 vertex which is not the degree-4 vertex must map accordingly. In $G_A$, vertex 6 is adjacent to 5. In $G_B$, vertex 6 is adjacent to 5. So, $f(6)=6$. The remaining vertices {1,2,3} are neighbors of vertex 4 in $G_A$ and have degree 1. The remaining vertices {1,3,4} are neighbors of vertex 2 in $G_B$ and have degree 1. We can map them arbitrarily, for example, $f(1)=1, f(2)=3, f(3)=4$. The function $f = \\{1\\to1, 2\\to3, 3\\to4, 4\\to2, 5\\to5, 6\\to6\\}$ is a bijection that preserves adjacency. Thus, $G_A$ and $G_B$ are isomorphic.\n- **Conclusion:** This pair consists of two isomorphic trees. It does not satisfy the conditions.\n\n**Analysis of Pair C**\n- $G_A$ is the same graph as in Pair A, which is the path graph $P_6$. It is a tree.\n- $G_B$ has the edge set $\\{(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,1)\\}$. It has 6 edges. For $n=6$ vertices, a tree must have 5 edges. Since $|E_B|=6 \\neq 5$, $G_B$ is not a tree. In fact, it is the cycle graph $C_6$.\n- **Conclusion:** $G_B$ is not a tree. This pair does not satisfy the conditions.\n\n**Analysis of Pair D**\n- $G_A$ is the same graph as in Pair A, which is the star graph $K_{1,5}$. It is a tree.\n- $G_B$ has the edge set $\\{(1,2), (2,3), (4,5), (5,6)\\}$. It has 4 edges. For $n=6$ vertices, a tree must have 5 edges. Since $|E_B|=4 \\neq 5$, $G_B$ is not a tree. Furthermore, there is no path from vertex 1 to vertex 4, so the graph is disconnected.\n- **Conclusion:** $G_B$ is not a tree.

Graph $G_1$ is also the complete bipartite graph $K_{3,3}$, but with the bipartition $\\{1,5,6\\}$ and $\\{2,3,4\\}$, which can be verified from its edge list. Since both $G_1$ and $G_3$ are two different labelings of the same graph structure ($K_{3,3}$), they are isomorphic.

For instance, $G_2$ contains two triangles, $\\{1,5,6\\}$ and $\\{2,3,4\\}$, which can be verified from its edge list. An explicit isomorphism $f$ from $G_2$ to $G_4$ is $f(1)=1, f(5)=2, f(6)=3, f(2)=4, f(3)=5, f(4)=6$.

An automorphism is an isomorphism of a graph to itself. A graph is said to be vertex-transitive if for any two of its vertices, there exists an automorphism that maps one to the other. Essentially, in a vertex-transitive graph, all vertices are structurally equivalent—the graph \"looks the same\" from every vertex.\n\nConsider two simple, undirected graphs, $G_1$ and $G_2$, each with 10 vertices and 15 edges.\n\nGraph $G_1$ is constructed as follows:\nThe vertex set is $V_1 = \\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, b_5\\}$.\nThe edge set $E_1$ consists of three types of edges:\n1.

Yes, they are isomorphic.\nB. No, because they have a different number of edges.\nC. No, because one graph is vertex-transitive while the other is not.\nD. No, because their degree sequences are different.", "solution": "We compare $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ via invariants preserved by isomorphism.\n\nFirst, we check the number of vertices and edges. By construction, both graphs have 10 vertices. For $G_1$, there are 5 edges in the 'a'-cycle, 5 in the 'b'-cycle, and 5 connecting edges, totaling 15 edges. For $G_2$, there are 10 edges in the 10-cycle and 5 additional chord edges, also totaling 15 edges. Since the vertex and edge counts are identical, option B is false.\n\nNext, we compute the degree sequences. In $G_1$, each vertex $a_i$ is adjacent to two other 'a' vertices in its cycle and one 'b' vertex ($b_i$), so its degree is 3. Similarly, each $b_i$ has a degree of 3. Thus, $G_1$ is a 3-regular graph. In $G_2$, each vertex is adjacent to two other vertices in the 10-cycle. The five chords, $\\{0, 5\\}, \\{1, 4\\}, \\{2, 8\\}, \\{3, 6\\}, \\{7, 9\\}$, form a perfect matching, meaning each vertex is an endpoint of exactly one chord. Therefore, each vertex in $G_2$ has a degree of $2+1=3$. Both graphs are 3-regular, so their degree sequences are identical: $(3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3)$. Option D is false.\n\nNow, we consider a more subtle invariant: vertex-transitivity.\nGraph $G_1$ is the prism graph $C_5 \\square K_2$. This graph is highly symmetric. For any vertex, we can rotate the graph and/or flip it between the 'a' and 'b' layers to map that vertex to any other vertex. Thus, $G_1$ is vertex-transitive.\n\nLet's examine $G_2$ for any structural differences between its vertices. We can check for the presence of small cycles, like triangles ($C_3$). A triangle is formed by three mutually adjacent vertices.\n- Consider the chord $\\{7, 9\\}$. The neighbors of 7 in the 10-cycle are 6 and 8. The neighbors of 9 are 8 and 0. Since 8 is a neighbor of both 7 and 9, the vertices $\\{7, 8, 9\\}$ form a triangle (edges are $\\{7,8\\}$, $\\{8,9\\}$ from the cycle, and $\\{7,9\\}$ is a chord).\n- Do other chords form triangles? For a chord $\\{u,v\\}$ to be part of a triangle, $u$ and $v$ must have a common neighbor.\n  - Chord $\\{1,4\\}$: Neighbors of 1 are $\\{0,2,4\\}$. Neighbors of 4 are $\\{1,3,5\\}$. There are no common neighbors.\n  - Chord $\\{0,5\\}$: Neighbors of 0 are $\\{1,9,5\\}$. Neighbors of 5 are $\\{0,4,6\\}$. No common neighbors.\n  - Chord $\\{2,8\\}$: Neighbors of 2 are $\\{1,3,8\\}$. Neighbors of 8 are $\\{2,7,9\\}$. No common neighbors.\n  - Chord $\\{3,6\\}$: Neighbors of 3 are $\\{2,4,6\\}$. Neighbors of 6 are $\\{3,5,7\\}$. No common neighbors.\nThe only triangle in $G_2$ is $\\{7,8,9\\}$. This means that vertices 7, 8, and 9 are part of a 3-cycle, while vertices like 0, 1, 2, etc., are not. Since not all vertices share this structural property, the graph cannot be vertex-transitive. An automorphism cannot map a vertex that is in a triangle to one that is not.\n\nSince vertex-transitivity is a graph invariant, and $G_1$ is vertex-transitive while $G_2$ is not, the two graphs cannot be isomorphic.
