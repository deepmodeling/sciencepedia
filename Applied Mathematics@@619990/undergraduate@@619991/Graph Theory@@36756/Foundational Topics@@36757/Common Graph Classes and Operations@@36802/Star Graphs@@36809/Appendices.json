This first exercise guides you through translating the visual structure of a simple star graph into its corresponding adjacency matrix. Mastering this fundamental skill is crucial, as it forms the basis for many computational algorithms in graph theory and network analysis [@problem_id:1535227].", "problem": "Consider a simple network topology modeled by a graph. The network has a single central router and three peripheral computers. Each computer is connected directly to the central router, but not to any other computer. This structure forms a star graph $S_3$. By the article's definition, this graph has 4 total vertices: one central vertex connected to 3 peripheral vertices (leaves).\n\nLet the vertices of this graph be labeled such that the central router is assigned the label $v_1$, and the peripheral computers are assigned the labels $v_2$, $v_3$, and $v_4$.\n\nThe connectivity of a graph with $n$ vertices labeled $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n$ can be represented by its adjacency matrix $A$, which is an $n \\times n$ matrix. The entry in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column, denoted $A_{ij}$, is defined as 1 if an edge exists between vertex $v_i$ and vertex $v_j$, and 0 otherwise. By convention, for a simple graph, there are no edges from a vertex to itself.\n\nBased on this information, determine the adjacency matrix for the described $S_3$ graph with the specified vertex labeling.", "solution": "We are given a simple undirected graph with vertices labeled $v_{1},v_{2},v_{3},v_{4}$, where $v_{1}$ is the central vertex connected to each of $v_{2},v_{3},v_{4}$, and no other edges exist. For a simple graph, the adjacency matrix $A$ is defined by $A_{ij}=1$ if there is an edge between $v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$, and $A_{ij}=0$ otherwise, with $A_{ii}=0$ for all $i$.\n\nIn the star $S_{3}$ with this labeling, the edges are precisely $\\{(v_{1},v_{2}), (v_{1},v_{3}), (v_{1},v_{4})\\}$. Because the graph is undirected, $A$ is symmetric, so $A_{12}=A_{21}=1$, $A_{13}=A_{31}=1$, and $A_{14}=A_{41}=1$. All other off-diagonal entries are $0$, and all diagonal entries are $0$.\n\nTherefore, the adjacency matrix in the order $(v_{1},v_{2},v_{3},v_{4})$ is\n$$\nA=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 1 & 1\\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 & 1 & 1\\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1535227"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple representation, we can now explore the intrinsic properties of star graphs. This practice presents a scenario about selecting compatible items, which, in graph theory terms, is equivalent to finding a maximum independent set.

The product line consists of one 'flagship' device and $N$ distinct 'accessory' devices, where $N$ is a positive integer. The marketing team must select a group of these products to feature in a single advertisement. Due to branding guidelines, certain products are considered 'incompatible' and cannot be featured together in the same ad. The compatibility rules are as follows:\n\n1.  The flagship device is incompatible with every accessory device.\n2.  Any two distinct accessory devices are compatible with each other.\n\nThe goal is to create an advertisement featuring the largest possible group of products that are all mutually compatible.

Including the flagship precludes including any accessory, hence the largest compatible group containing the flagship has size $|F|=1$.

This final practice challenges you to investigate the possibility of a \"Hamiltonian path\" â€” a path that visits every node exactly once. By exploring this question for a star graph, you will gain a deeper intuition for how the central hub's role as a bottleneck limits the types of traversals possible in this common topology, a key insight for network design and logistics [@problem_id:1535249].", "problem": "A network administrator is designing a 'hub-and-spoke' network topology. A network with a total of $n$ nodes consists of one central 'hub' node and $n-1$ peripheral 'spoke' nodes. A communication link (an edge) exists between the hub and each of the $n-1$ spokes, but no links exist directly between any two spoke nodes.\n\nThe administrator needs to test a data-validation protocol where a special packet must originate at some node and be routed through the network, visiting every single node exactly once before terminating.

The required routing path is a Hamiltonian path, i.e., a simple path that visits every vertex exactly once.\n\nObservation: In $K_{1,n-1}$, no two spokes are adjacent. Therefore, the only way to move from one spoke to another is through the hub. However, in a Hamiltonian path, no vertex can be visited more than once. Consequently, a Hamiltonian path can include at most two distinct spokes: starting at one spoke, going to the hub, and then to a second spoke. Including a third spoke would require revisiting the hub, which is not allowed.\n\nSince all non-hub vertices are spokes, the total number of spokes used by a Hamiltonian path must equal the total number of spokes in the graph. Thus, a Hamiltonian path can exist only if the total number of spokes satisfies\n$$\nn-1 \\le 2 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad n \\le 3.\n$$\n\nIt remains to verify existence for these cases:\n- For $n=1$, the single vertex itself is a Hamiltonian path (trivial path).\n- For $n=2$, the unique edge between hub and the single spoke is a Hamiltonian path.\n- For $n=3$, a Hamiltonian path exists: spoke $1 \\to$ hub $\\to$ spoke $2$.\n\nFor $n \\ge 4$, there are at least $3$ spokes, which is impossible for a Hamiltonian path as argued.
