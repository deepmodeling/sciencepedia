[@problem_id:1525932]", "problem": "In graph theory, a graph is a structure consisting of a set of vertices and a set of edges, where each edge connects a pair of vertices. A graph $H$ is a **subgraph** of a graph $G$ if the vertices of $H$ are a subset of the vertices of $G$, and the edges of $H$ are a subset of the edges of $G$. Two graphs are said to be **isomorphic** if they have the same number of vertices and edges and there is a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices that preserves the connections (adjacency).\n\nThe **complete graph** on $n$ vertices, denoted $K_n$, is the simple graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge.\nThe **path graph** on $n$ vertices, denoted $P_n$, is a graph with vertices $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n$ and edges connecting $v_i$ to $v_{i+1}$ for all $1 \\le i  n$.\n\nConsider the complete graph on four vertices, $K_4$. Your task is to determine the total number of distinct subgraphs of $K_4$ that are isomorphic to the path graph on three vertices, $P_3$.", "solution": "Let the set of vertices of the complete graph $K_4$ be $V = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\\}$. In $K_4$, every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. Thus, the number of edges in $K_4$ is $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6$.\n\nWe are looking for the number of subgraphs of $K_4$ that are isomorphic to the path graph $P_3$.\nFirst, let's characterize the graph $P_3$. A path graph on three vertices, $P_3$, consists of 3 vertices and 2 edges. The edges connect the vertices in a line, for example, $a-b-c$. In this structure, one vertex (the \"center\") has a degree of 2, and the other two vertices (the \"endpoints\") each have a degree of 1.\n\nTo count the number of such subgraphs in $K_4$, we can identify all possible structures within $K_4$ that match this description. A subgraph is defined by its set of vertices and its set of edges. So, a subgraph isomorphic to $P_3$ is determined by a choice of 3 vertices and 2 edges from $K_4$ that form a path.\n\nWe can solve this problem systematically using a combinatorial approach. Let's count the number of ways to form a $P_3$ path by first choosing its central vertex.\n\n**Step 1: Choose the central vertex of the path.**\nA $P_3$ path is of the form endpoint - center - endpoint. Any of the 4 vertices of $K_4$ can serve as the central vertex of a path. So, there are 4 choices for the central vertex. Let's pick an arbitrary vertex, say $v_c$, to be the center.\n\n**Step 2: Choose the two endpoints of the path.**\nThe central vertex of a $P_3$ must be connected to two other vertices, which will serve as the endpoints of the path. In $K_4$, every vertex is connected to every other vertex. If we have chosen $v_c$ as the center, it is connected to the remaining $4-1=3$ vertices. We need to choose 2 of these 3 vertices to be the endpoints of our path.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 endpoints from the 3 available neighbors of $v_c$ is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{3}{2}$.\n$$ \\binom{3}{2} = \\frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = \\frac{3!}{2!1!} = 3 $$\nSo, for each choice of a central vertex, there are 3 ways to form a $P_3$ path.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of subgraphs.**\nThe total number of subgraphs of $K_4$ isomorphic to $P_3$ is the product of the number of choices in Step 1 and Step 2.\nTotal number = (Number of choices for the central vertex) $\\times$ (Number of ways to choose 2 endpoints for it)\n$$ \\text{Total number} = 4 \\times \\binom{3}{2} = 4 \\times 3 = 12 $$\n\nAlternatively, we can count the number of pairs of adjacent edges in $K_4$.\nA $P_3$ path is formed by two edges that share a common vertex.\nThe total number of edges in $K_4$ is $E = \\binom{4}{2} = 6$.\nThe degree of each vertex in $K_4$ is $3$.\nLet's count the number of paths of length 2 (which are isomorphic to $P_3$) by summing the contributions from each vertex. The number of paths of length 2 with a specific vertex $v$ as the center is the number of ways to choose 2 edges incident to $v$. Since the degree of each vertex is 3, there are $\\binom{3}{2}=3$ such pairs of edges for each vertex.\nSince there are 4 vertices, the total number of paths is:\n$$ \\sum_{v \\in V(K_4)} \\binom{\\text{deg}(v)}{2} = 4 \\times \\binom{3}{2} = 4 \\times 3 = 12 $$\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nTherefore, there are 12 distinct subgraphs of $K_4$ that are isomorphic to $P_3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12}$$", "id": "1525932"}, {"introduction": "Path graphs provide a natural model for linear systems where adjacent elements can be paired, from data processing pipelines to molecular chains.
