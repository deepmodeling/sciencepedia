One such operation is the Cartesian product.

Since the only edges connecting the two rails are rungs, any cycle must cross between the rails an even number of times. A 4-cycle cannot use $0$ rungs (it would lie entirely on a single rail, which is a path and has no cycles) and cannot use $4$ rungs (there are no edges directly connecting nonmatching $u$- or $v$-vertices needed to close such a cycle). Therefore, any 4-cycle must use exactly $2$ rungs.\n\nLet those rungs be $(u_{p},v_{p})$ and $(u_{q},v_{q})$ with $p\\neq q$. The remaining two edges of the cycle must lie on the rails, namely $(u_{p},u_{q})$ on the top and $(v_{p},v_{q})$ on the bottom.

Suppose for contradiction that $|D|=2$.\n1. If $D$ contains a corner vertex, then that vertex dominates at most $3$ vertices (it has degree $2$), while any other vertex dominates at most $4$. Hence two vertices can dominate at most $3+4=78$, a contradiction. Therefore both vertices of $D$ must be non-corner vertices, i.e., lie in columns $2$ or $3$.\n2. If both vertices of $D$ lie in the same column (both in column $2$ or both in column $3$), then one end column cannot be dominated. For instance, if both are in column $2$, then a vertex in column $4$ is adjacent only to its neighbor in column $3$ or its vertical neighbor in column $4$, none of which lies in $D$; hence column $4$ contains undominated vertices. This is impossible, so the two vertices of $D$ must lie in different columns, one in column $2$ and one in column $3$.\n3. Let $x \\in D$ be in column $2$ and $y \\in D$ be in column $3$. To dominate $v_{1,4}$, we must have $y$ in row $1$ (since there is no vertex of $D$ in column $4$). To dominate $v_{2,1}$, we must have $x$ in row $2$ (since there is no vertex of $D$ in column $1$).

But then $v_{1,1}$ has neighbors only $v_{1,2}$ and $v_{2,1}$, neither of which is in $D$, and $v_{1,1} \\notin D$, so $v_{1,1}$ is undominated—a contradiction.\n\nTherefore no dominating set of size $2$ exists, so $\\gamma(G) \\ge 3$.
