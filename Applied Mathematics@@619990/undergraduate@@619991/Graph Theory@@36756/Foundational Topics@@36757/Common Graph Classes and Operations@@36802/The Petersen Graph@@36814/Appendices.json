This process generates a BFS tree rooted at the starting vertex.\n\nDuring the traversal, a specific tie-breaking rule must be followed. When multiple neighbors of a vertex need to be added to the search queue, they are processed in a fixed order. To establish this order, each vertex (a 2-element subset $\\{a, b\\}$) is represented as an ordered pair $(a, b)$ with $a < b$. The neighbors are then added to the queue according to the lexicographical order of these pairs.

For a $3$-regular graph of odd girth $5$, the Moore bound gives\n$$\nn \\geq 1 + 3 + 3(3-1) = 10,\n$$\nand equality holds here. Therefore $G$ is a Moore graph with parameters $(3,5)$, which is uniquely the Petersen graph. Hence we may use standard properties of the Petersen graph.\n\nForm $G'$ by deleting an arbitrary edge $e=uv$ of $G$. In any graph, deleting an edge cannot create cycles, so the set of cycles of $G'$ is a subset of those of $G$. In particular, no triangles or $4$-cycles can appear in $G'$ since $G$ has none. It remains to determine whether $5$-cycles persist after removing one edge.\n\nA key property we use is that the Petersen graph contains two edge-disjoint $5$-cycles. One way to see this rigorously is: the Petersen graph is bridgeless and $3$-regular, so by Petersen’s theorem it has a perfect matching; deleting that perfect matching leaves a $2$-regular spanning subgraph on $10$ vertices with no $3$- or $4$-cycles, hence it must be the disjoint union of two $5$-cycles. Therefore, there exist two edge-disjoint $5$-cycles in $G$. Deleting a single edge can meet at most one of these two cycles, so at least one $5$-cycle remains in $G'$. Consequently, the girth of $G'$ is still $5$ and $G'$ contains an odd cycle.\n\nNow we evaluate each statement:\n\nA. $G'$ is bipartite. A graph is bipartite if and only if it has no odd cycles. Since $G'$ still contains a $5$-cycle, it is not bipartite. Thus A is false.\n\nB. The chromatic number of $G'$ is $3$. The Petersen graph has chromatic number $3$. Since $G'$ is a subgraph of $G$, we have $\\chi(G') \\leq \\chi(G) = 3$. Also, $G'$ is not bipartite because it contains an odd cycle, so $\\chi(G') \\geq 3$. Therefore $\\chi(G')=3$. Thus B is true.\n\nC. $G'$ is planar. Because $G$ has no triangles or $4$-cycles, and edge deletion cannot create cycles, $G'$ also has no triangles or $4$-cycles. Hence its girth is $5$. For any planar simple graph with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges, and girth $g \\geq 3$, Euler’s formula implies\n$$\nm \\leq \\frac{g}{g-2}(n-2).\n$$\nSubstituting $g=5$ and $n=10$ gives $m \\leq \\frac{5}{3}(8) = \\frac{40}{3}$, hence $m \\leq 13$. But $G'$ has $m=15-1=14$ edges, which violates this bound. Therefore $G'$ cannot be planar. Thus C is false.\n\nD. The number of vertices of degree $2$ in $G'$ is exactly $2$. Deleting a single edge $uv$ from a $3$-regular simple graph reduces the degree of $u$ and $v$ from $3$ to $2$, and leaves all other vertex degrees unchanged at $3$. Therefore exactly two vertices have degree $2$. Thus D is true.\n\nE. The girth of $G'$ is $4$. As noted, deleting edges cannot create cycles, so no $4$-cycle can appear if none existed in $G$. Since $G$ had girth $5$ and at least one $5$-cycle remains, the girth of $G'$ is still $5$, not $4$. Thus E is false.\n\nCollecting the truths: only B and D are necessarily true for any choice of the removed edge.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BD}$$", "id": "1545616"}]}
