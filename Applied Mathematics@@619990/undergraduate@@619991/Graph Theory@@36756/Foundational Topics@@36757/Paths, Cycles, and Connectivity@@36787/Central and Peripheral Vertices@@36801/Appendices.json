Since the two vertices are adjacent, some central vertex is adjacent to a peripheral vertex, so the property fails.\n\n- For $n=3$: The connected graphs are $K_{3}$ and $P_{3}$. In $K_{3}$, $r=D=1$ and $C=P=V(G)$, so the property fails. In $P_{3}$, the unique central vertex is the middle vertex and the peripheral vertices are the two ends; the middle vertex is adjacent to both ends, so the property fails.\n\n- For $n=4$: If $r=1$, then some $c\\in C$ is adjacent to all other vertices, hence to any $p\\in P$, contradicting the property. If $r=2$, then no vertex can have degree $3$ (otherwise that vertex would have eccentricity $1$), so $\\Delta(G)\\le 2$.
