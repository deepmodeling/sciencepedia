If $x\\in V_{1}$ and $y\\in V_{2}$, then by completeness across the bipartition there is an edge $\\{x,y\\}$, so the shortest path has length $1$, hence $d(x,y)=1$.\n\n2.

The travel network for this tour is designed for maximum convenience: there is a direct, non-stop flight available between every pair of distinct cities in the package. The agency wants to create a special itinerary called the 'Grand Odyssey'. This itinerary must be a path that visits a sequence of cities without ever revisiting a city. The length of an itinerary is defined as the total number of flights taken. What is the maximum possible length of a 'Grand Odyssey' itinerary?", "solution": "Let's model this problem using graph theory. The cities can be represented as vertices in a graph $G$, and the direct flights between them as edges.\n\nThe problem statement specifies that there is a direct, non-stop flight available between every pair of distinct cities. This means that for any two distinct vertices in our graph, there is an edge connecting them. A graph with this property is called a complete graph, denoted by $K_n$, where $n$ is the number of vertices. In this scenario, there are 23 cities, so we are dealing with a complete graph $K_{23}$, where $n=23$.\n\nThe itinerary, called the 'Grand Odyssey', is described as a path that visits a sequence of cities without ever revisiting a city. In graph theory, this corresponds to a simple path, which is a path that does not contain repeated vertices.\n\nThe length of the itinerary is the total number of flights taken. In our graph model, this is the number of edges in the simple path. A simple path that visits $k$ distinct vertices will have a length of $k-1$. For example, a path visiting vertices $(v_1, v_2, v_3)$ consists of two edges, $(v_1, v_2)$ and $(v_2, v_3)$, and thus has a length of $3-1=2$.\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum possible length of such an itinerary. This is equivalent to finding the length of the longest simple path in the graph $K_{23}$.\n\nLet's consider a generic simple path in a graph with $n$ vertices. Since a simple path cannot have repeated vertices, the maximum number of vertices it can possibly visit is $n$. Such a path, which visits every vertex in the graph exactly once, is known as a Hamiltonian path.\n\nIf a path visits all $n$ vertices, it contains $n$ vertices. The length of such a path is $n-1$. Since a path cannot visit more than $n$ vertices (as there are only $n$ vertices available in the graph), the maximum possible length for any simple path is $n-1$.\n\nNow we must confirm that a path of this length actually exists in our graph, $K_{23}$. A complete graph $K_n$ has an edge between any two distinct vertices. Therefore, we can easily construct a path that visits all $n$ vertices. Let the vertices be labeled $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n$. The sequence of vertices $(v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n)$ forms a simple path because for any $i$ from 1 to $n-1$, the edge $(v_i, v_{i+1})$ exists by the definition of a complete graph. This path visits all $n$ vertices and has length $n-1$.\n\nSince a path of length $n-1$ is achievable and no path can be longer, the maximum possible length is indeed $n-1$.\n\nFor this specific problem, the number of cities (vertices) is $n=23$. Applying our general result, the maximum possible length of a 'Grand Odyssey' itinerary is:\n$$ \\text{Maximum Length} = n - 1 = 23 - 1 = 22 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{22}$$", "id": "1518806"}]}
