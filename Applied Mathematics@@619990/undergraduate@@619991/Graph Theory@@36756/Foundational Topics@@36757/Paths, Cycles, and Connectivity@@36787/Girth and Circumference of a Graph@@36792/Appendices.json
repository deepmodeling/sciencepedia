Hence every edge goes between $A$ and $B$, and there are no edges inside $A$ or inside $B$. Therefore $H_{n}$ is bipartite and contains no odd cycles. In particular, any cycle must have even length at least $4$; cycles of length $2$ do not occur because the graph is simple and has no multiple edges or loops.\n\nNext, we exhibit a $4$-cycle whenever $n \\ge 2$.

The dodecahedron, with its distinctive pentagonal faces, provides a perfect real-world example for this application. This practice challenges you to determine the girth of the dodecahedral graph by relating the abstract concept of a cycle directly to the tangible geometric features of the solid from which it is derived.

By definition, the boundary of each face is a simple cycle of length 5, so there exists a 5-cycle in the graph. Therefore the girth $g$ satisfies $g \\le 5$.\n\nTo show that no shorter cycle exists, suppose, for contradiction, that there is a simple cycle $C$ of length $k < 5$. In a planar embedding of a simple graph, $C$ is a Jordan curve whose interior is a union of faces. Each interior face of the dodecahedral graph has length 5. If $k=3$ or $k=4$, then the region bounded by $C$ would have to be decomposed into pentagonal faces glued along edges. Counting boundary edges of the region gives the standard boundary-count identity: if $F$ is the number of interior faces and $E_{\\text{int}}$ the number of edges shared by two interior faces, then the total boundary length $k$ satisfies\n$$\nk = 5F - 2E_{\\text{int}}.\n$$\nSince $F \\ge 1$ and the graph is simple and planar with all faces pentagons, the smallest possible boundary arises when $F=1$ and $E_{\\text{int}}=0$, which gives $k=5$.
