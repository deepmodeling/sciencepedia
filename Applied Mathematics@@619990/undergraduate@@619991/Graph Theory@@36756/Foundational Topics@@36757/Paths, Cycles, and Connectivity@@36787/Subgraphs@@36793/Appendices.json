Equivalently, the graph must have a $4$-cycle for which the induced subgraph on its four vertices includes at least one additional edge beyond the four cycle edges (a chord), so that the induced subgraph is not isomorphic to $C_{4}$.\n\nAnalyze each option:\n\nA. In $G_{A}$, the edges $(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,1)$ form a $C_{4}$ on $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$. Among these four vertices, there are no additional edges, since $(1,3)$ and $(2,4)$ are absent. Hence $G_{A}[\\{1,2,3,4\\}]$ is exactly $C_{4}$, so $C_{4}$ appears as an induced subgraph. Therefore $G_{A}$ does not satisfy the property.\n\nB. In $K_{2,3}$, choose $\\{a_{1},a_{2},b_{i},b_{j}\\}$ with $i \\neq j$. The induced subgraph on these four vertices is $K_{2,2}$, which is exactly $C_{4}$. There are no chords because there are no edges within the same part. Thus $C_{4}$ appears as an induced subgraph. Therefore $K_{2,3}$ does not satisfy the property.\n\nC. In $K_{4}$, a $C_{4}$ exists as a subgraph by choosing any four vertices (all of them) and taking four edges that form a cycle. However, the induced subgraph on these four vertices is $K_{4}$ with $6$ edges, which is not $C_{4}$. Thus $K_{4}$ contains $C_{4}$ as a subgraph but not as an induced subgraph. Therefore $K_{4}$ satisfies the property.\n\nD. The path $P_{5}$ has no cycles, hence it does not contain $C_{4}$ as a subgraph. Therefore it does not satisfy the property.\n\nE. The wheel $W_{5}$ consists of a $C_{4}$ rim plus a central vertex adjacent to all rim vertices. The induced subgraph on the rim vertices is exactly $C_{4}$, so it contains an induced $C_{4}$.

A key property of any network or graph is connectivity, and we can ask whether this property is preserved when we zoom in on smaller subsets of vertices.

When a task force is formed, it inherits all the communication links that exist between the nodes within that subset.

By definition, a task force is coherent if and only if its induced subgraph is connected. \n\nIn a path graph, an induced subgraph on a subset $S$ is connected if and only if $S$ is a contiguous block of vertices along the path order. Indeed, if $S$ omits some vertex between two included vertices, then the unique path in $P_{4}$ between those included vertices passes through the omitted vertex, so the induced subgraph disconnects; conversely, any contiguous block induces a connected path.\n\nTherefore, coherent task forces correspond exactly to contiguous blocks of vertices.
