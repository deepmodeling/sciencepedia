Hence every pair of vertices in $\\bar{G}$ is connected by a path of length at most $2$, so $\\bar{G}$ is connected. Thus it is impossible for both $G$ and $\\bar{G}$ to be disconnected, and B is true.\n\nFor C, consider $G$ as the disjoint union of $K_{n-1}$ and an isolated vertex for $n \\geq 5$. Then $G$ is disconnected and has $m(G) = \\binom{n-1}{2}$ edges. Since $m(G) + m(\\bar{G}) = \\binom{n}{2}$, the condition $m(G) > m(\\bar{G})$ is equivalent to $m(G) > \\frac{1}{2}\\binom{n}{2}$. This leads to the inequality:\n$$\n\\binom{n-1}{2} > \\frac{n(n-1)}{4}\n$$\nBy simplifying, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} > \\frac{n(n-1)}{4} \\iff 2(n-1)(n-2) > n(n-1) \\iff 2(n-2) > n \\iff n > 4.\n$$\nThus for $n \\geq 5$, $G$ is disconnected and has more edges than its complement, so C is false.\n\nFor D, take $G = K_{5,5}$, which is non-planar.
