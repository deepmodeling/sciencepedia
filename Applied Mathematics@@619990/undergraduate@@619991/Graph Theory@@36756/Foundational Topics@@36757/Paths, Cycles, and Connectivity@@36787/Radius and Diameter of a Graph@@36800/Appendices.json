The vertices of the graph can be partitioned into two sets: a set $U$ of $m$ computation nodes and a set $V$ of $n$ storage nodes. An edge exists between a vertex from $U$ and a vertex from $V$, but there are no edges between any two vertices within $U$ or any two vertices within $V$. This is the definition of a complete bipartite graph, denoted $K_{m,n}$.\n\nTo determine the radius and diameter of this graph, we first need to understand the distances between any two vertices. Let's analyze the distance $d(u,v)$ for any two vertices $u$ and $v$.\n\n1.  **Distance between vertices in different partitions:** Let $u \\in U$ and $v \\in V$. By the definition of the graph, there is an edge connecting every vertex in $U$ to every vertex in $V$. Therefore, $u$ and $v$ are adjacent, and the shortest path between them is the edge itself. So, $d(u,v) = 1$.\n\n2.  **Distance between vertices in the same partition:** Let $u$ and $v$ be two distinct vertices in the same partition, for instance, $u, v \\in U$. By definition, there is no edge between them, so $d(u,v) > 1$. However, we can find a path from $u$ to $v$ by going through a vertex in the other partition. Since $m,n \\ge 1$, the set $V$ is not empty. Let $w$ be any vertex in $V$. Since the graph is a *complete* bipartite graph, both $u$ and $v$ are adjacent to $w$. This gives us a path $u \\to w \\to v$ of length 2. Since $d(u,v) > 1$, the shortest path must have length 2. Thus, $d(u,v) = 2$. A similar argument holds for any two distinct vertices in $V$.\n\nIn summary: the distance between any two vertices is 1 if they are in different partitions, and 2 if they are in the same partition (and are distinct).\n\nNext, we calculate the eccentricity $\\epsilon(v)$ for each vertex $v$, which is the maximum distance from $v$ to any other vertex. $\\epsilon(v) = \\max_{u \\in G} d(v,u)$. We need to consider three cases for the values of $m$ and $n$.\n\n**Case 1: $m=1$ and $n=1$.**\nThe graph is $K_{1,1}$, which consists of two vertices, one in $U$ and one in $V$, connected by a single edge. Let $U=\\{u_1\\}$ and $V=\\{v_1\\}$. The only distance to calculate is $d(u_1, v_1) = 1$. The eccentricity of $u_1$ is $\\epsilon(u_1) = d(u_1,v_1)=1$. The eccentricity of $v_1$ is $\\epsilon(v_1) = d(v_1,u_1)=1$.\nThe radius is the minimum eccentricity: $rad(G) = \\min\\{1, 1\\} = 1$.\nThe diameter is the maximum eccentricity: $diam(G) = \\max\\{1, 1\\} = 1$.\nTherefore, statement **C** is true.\n\n**Case 2: Exactly one of $m$ or $n$ is 1 (and the other is greater than 1).**\nWithout loss of generality, let $m=1$ and $n > 1$. This graph is a star graph $K_{1,n}$. The partition $U$ has a single vertex, let's call it $u_c$ (the center), and $V$ has $n$ vertices, $\\{v_1, v_2, ..., v_n\\}$ (the leaves).\nLet's find the eccentricity of the central vertex $u_c$. The distance from $u_c$ to any leaf $v_i$ is $d(u_c, v_i) = 1$. So, $\\epsilon(u_c) = \\max_{i} \\{d(u_c, v_i)\\} = 1$.\nNow, let's find the eccentricity of a leaf vertex, say $v_i$. The distance from $v_i$ to the center is $d(v_i, u_c) = 1$. The distance from $v_i$ to any other leaf $v_j$ (where $j \\ne i$) is $d(v_i, v_j) = 2$, since the path is $v_i \\to u_c \\to v_j$.\nSo, $\\epsilon(v_i) = \\max(\\{d(v_i, u_c)\\} \\cup \\{d(v_i, v_j) \\text{ for } j \\ne i\\}) = \\max(\\{1\\} \\cup \\{2\\}) = 2$.\nThe set of all eccentricities is $\\{1, 2, 2, ..., 2\\}$.\nThe radius is the minimum eccentricity: $rad(G) = \\min\\{1, 2\\} = 1$.\nThe diameter is the maximum eccentricity: $diam(G) = \\max\\{1, 2\\} = 2$.\nTherefore, statement **E** is true.\n\n**Case 3: $m > 1$ and $n > 1$.**\nLet's find the eccentricity of any vertex $u \\in U$. For any other vertex $v$, the distance $d(u,v)$ is either 1 (if $v \\in V$) or 2 (if $v \\in U$ and $v \\ne u$). Since $m>1$, there is at least one other vertex $u' \\in U$ distinct from $u$. The distance $d(u,u')=2$. Thus, the maximum distance from $u$ to any other vertex is 2. So, $\\epsilon(u) = 2$ for all $u \\in U$.\nSimilarly, for any vertex $v \\in V$, since $n>1$, there exists another vertex $v' \\in V$ for which $d(v,v')=2$. Thus, the maximum distance from $v$ to any other vertex is 2. So, $\\epsilon(v) = 2$ for all $v \\in V$.\nIn this case, every vertex in the graph has an eccentricity of 2.\nThe radius is the minimum eccentricity: $rad(G) = \\min\\{2\\} = 2$.\nThe diameter is the maximum eccentricity: $diam(G) = \\max\\{2\\} = 2$.\nTherefore, statement **D** is true.\n\nNow we evaluate the given statements:\nA. For any $m \\ge 1, n \\ge 1$, the radius is 1. This is false, as shown in Case 3 where the radius is 2.\nB. For any $m \\ge 1, n \\ge 1$, the diameter is 2.

If $m > 1$ and $n > 1$, the radius and diameter are both 2. This is true from our analysis of Case 3.\nE. If exactly one of $m$ or $n$ is equal to 1 (and the other is greater than 1), the radius is 1 and the diameter is 2.
