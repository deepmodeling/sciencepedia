For their initial model, they represent the network as a graph where each of the $n$ users is a vertex. They make a simplifying assumption that the network is fully connected; that is, an edge exists between every pair of distinct users. The team is interested in quantifying network density by counting the number of 'triadic closures,' which are sets of three distinct users who are all mutually connected. A triadic closure corresponds to a 3-cycle in the graph model. Your task is to determine a general formula for the total number of distinct triadic closures in this fully connected network of $n$ users.\n\nExpress your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $n$.", "solution": "We model the network as the complete graph $K_{n}$ on $n$ vertices, where an edge exists between every pair of distinct vertices. A triadic closure is defined as a set of three distinct users all mutually connected, which corresponds to a triangle (3-cycle) in the graph.\n\nIn $K_{n}$, any choice of three distinct vertices induces a $K_{3}$ (a triangle), because all pairwise edges among those three vertices are present. Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between triadic closures and 3-element subsets of the $n$ vertices.\n\nThe number of such subsets is the binomial coefficient:\n$$\n\\binom{n}{3}.\n$$\nEquivalently, one can count ordered triples of distinct vertices, which is $n(n-1)(n-2)$, and then divide by $3!$ to account for the $3!$ permutations of the same unordered triple:\n$$\n\\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{3!}=\\binom{n}{3}.\n$$\nThus, the total number of distinct triadic closures in a fully connected network of $n$ users is $\\binom{n}{3}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\binom{n}{3}}$$", "id": "1494456"}, {"introduction": "Many real-world systems, from processor architectures to transportation grids, can be modeled using structured graphs. This exercise explores cycles in a grid graph, introducing the concept of a graph's girthâ€”the length of its shortest cycle.

The architecture consists of a rectangular array of processing units.

That is, a unit at position $(i, j)$ in the array (row $i$, column $j$) is connected by a bidirectional data link to units at $(i-1, j)$, $(i+1, j)$, $(i, j-1)$, and $(i, j+1)$, provided these units exist within the $m \\times n$ array.\n\nA \"feedback loop\" is a path a signal can take, starting from one processing unit, passing through a sequence of other distinct units via the data links, and finally returning to the original unit.

A feedback loop as defined is a simple cycle, and its length is the number of edges traversed.\n\nFirst, determine the shortest possible cycle length. The grid graph is bipartite (partition by the parity of $i+j$), so every cycle has even length; in particular, triangles do not exist. A 2-cycle is impossible in a simple graph. There do exist 4-cycles: for any $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,m-1\\}$ and $j \\in \\{1,\\dots,n-1\\}$, the vertices $(i,j)$, $(i,j+1)$, $(i+1,j+1)$, $(i+1,j)$ form a 4-cycle. Hence the shortest possible length is $4$.\n\nNext, count all distinct 4-cycles. Any length-4 cycle in this grid must consist of two horizontal and two vertical steps in alternation to return to the starting vertex without repeating vertices; this forces the four vertices to be the corners of a unit square determined by a pair of adjacent rows and a pair of adjacent columns. Thus there is a bijection between 4-cycles and choices of adjacent row indices $(i,i+1)$ with $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,m-1\\}$ and adjacent column indices $(j,j+1)$ with $j \\in \\{1,\\dots,n-1\\}$. The number of such choices is\n$$\n(m-1)(n-1).\n$$\nEach such choice determines exactly one cycle as a set of vertices and edges; changing the starting point or traversal direction does not produce a distinct loop under the usual notion of distinct cycles as different sets of traversed units/links.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct feedback loops of the shortest possible length is $(m-1)(n-1)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(m-1)(n-1)}$$", "id": "1494453"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond counting specific cycles, a more general challenge in graph theory is to measure a network's overall redundancy or \"cyclicality.\" This practice addresses a crucial problem in network design: determining the minimum number of connections to sever to eliminate all cycles and ensure stability.

Therefore, at least\n$$\nE_{i}-(V_{i}-1)\n$$\nedges must be removed from component $i$ to eliminate all cycles.\n\nSumming this lower bound over all $k$ components gives a global lower bound on the number of edge removals required:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\bigl(E_{i}-(V_{i}-1)\\bigr)=\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k}E_{i}\\right)-\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k}V_{i}\\right)+\\sum_{i=1}^{k}1=E-V+k.\n$$\nThis lower bound is achievable.
