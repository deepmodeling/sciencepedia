One of the most powerful and basic tools for this is the handshaking lemma, which states that the sum of degrees in any simple graph must be an even number. This exercise [@problem_id:1533148] presents a hypothetical network design and asks you to use this lemma as a first-pass feasibility test, a skill essential for any network engineer or computer scientist.", "problem": "A team of network engineers is designing a small, interconnected system of 7 specialized servers. For this system to function correctly, the servers must be linked by direct, bidirectional communication channels. The design specifications require that no server is connected to itself, and there can be at most one direct channel between any pair of servers. The proposed design specifies the number of direct channels connected to each of the 7 servers. This specification is given by the sequence of connection counts (6, 5, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1).\n\nYour task is to determine if it is physically possible to construct such a network of servers and channels according to these specifications. Which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA. The network configuration is possible to construct as specified.\n\nB. The network configuration is impossible to construct.\n\nC. The network configuration is possible only if multiple distinct channels between the same two servers are allowed.\n\nD. The network configuration is possible only if a server is allowed to have a channel connecting to itself.\n\nE. More information is needed to determine the feasibility of the configuration.", "solution": "Let the system be modeled as a simple undirected graph with $n=7$ vertices and degree sequence $(6,5,4,2,2,1,1)$. The specifications include: no loops and at most one edge between any pair of distinct vertices. The fundamental principle to use is the Handshaking Lemma.\n\nThe Handshaking Lemma states that for any undirected graph (simple or with multiple edges), the sum of the degrees of all vertices equals twice the number of edges:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_{i} = 2|E|.\n$$\nIn particular, the left-hand side must be an even integer.\n\nCompute the sum of the given degrees:\n$$\n6+5+4+2+2+1+1 = 21.\n$$\nSince $21$ is odd, this contradicts the necessity that $\\sum d_{i}$ be even. Therefore, no simple undirected graph can realize this degree sequence.\n\nConsider whether allowing multiple edges or loops could change this conclusion. For a multigraph without loops, each edge still contributes $2$ to the total degree, so $\\sum d_{i}=2|E|$ remains even. If loops are allowed, each loop contributes $2$ to the degree of its incident vertex, so the total degree sum is still even. Hence the parity obstruction persists under both relaxations.\n\nTherefore, the configuration is impossible to construct under the given rules, and also cannot be rescued by allowing multiple edges or loops.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1533148"}, {"introduction": "Moving from possibility to practicality, many design problems involve not just meeting specifications, but doing so efficiently.

The design specifications require that every computer in the network must be directly connected to exactly four other distinct computers. These connections are bidirectional, and there can be at most one direct connection link between any pair of computers. For a network to be valid, it must adhere to these rules. The administrator aims to build a functional network that satisfies these criteria while using the minimum possible number of computers to reduce initial setup costs. What is the minimum number of computers required to construct such a network?", "solution": "Interpret the network as a simple undirected graph with $n$ vertices (computers), where each vertex has degree exactly $4$ (each computer is directly connected to exactly four other distinct computers), and there is at most one edge between any pair of vertices, with no loops.\n\n1. Necessity of a lower bound on $n$:\n- Since each computer must connect to $4$ other distinct computers and self-connections are disallowed, each vertex needs at least $4$ distinct neighbors.\n- Therefore, the total number of vertices must satisfy $n-1 \\geq 4$, which yields\n$$\nn \\geq 5.\n$$\n\n2.

On 6 vertices, the only possible decompositions into cycles of length at least 3 are a single cycle of length 6 and a disjoint union of two cycles of length 3. Thus the two non-isomorphic graphs are $C_{6}$ and $C_{3}\\cup C_{3}$.\n\n- For bipartiteness: A cycle $C_{n}$ is bipartite if and only if $n$ is even. Therefore, $C_{6}$ is bipartite, but each $C_{3}$ is not bipartite; hence $C_{3}\\cup C_{3}$ is not bipartite. Thus it is not true that both are bipartite, so option A is false.\n\n- For the presence of a $4$-cycle: Neither $C_{6}$ nor $C_{3}\\cup C_{3}$ contains a cycle of length $4$, since $C_{6}$ has only the 6-cycle and $C_{3}\\cup C_{3}$ has only 3-cycles. Hence option B is false.\n\n- For connectivity: $C_{6}$ is connected, while $C_{3}\\cup C_{3}$ has two connected components, so it is not connected. Therefore one is connected and the other is not, so option C is true.\n\n- For the number of edges: In a $k$-regular graph on $n$ vertices, the number of edges is $m=\\frac{k n}{2}$. Here $k=2$ and $n=6$, so both graphs have $m=\\frac{2\\cdot 6}{2}=6$ edges. Hence option D is false.\n\n- For degree sequences: Both graphs are 2-regular on 6 vertices, so both have degree sequence $(2,2,2,2,2,2)$.
