A vertex cover is a set $S\\subseteq V$ such that for every edge $(u,v)\\in E$, at least one of $u$ or $v$ is in $S$.\n\nStatement A: Let $S_{\\text{even}}=\\{2k\\mid k\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\}$. For any edge $(i,i+1)$ with $i\\in\\mathbb{Z}$, exactly one of $i$ or $i+1$ is even because consecutive integers have opposite parity.

Hence there are at least two distinct vertex covers, and B is true.\n\nStatement C: Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists a finite vertex cover $S\\subseteq\\mathbb{Z}$. If $S=\\emptyset$, then the edge $(0,1)$ is uncovered, so $S$ is not a vertex cover. If $S\\neq\\emptyset$, let $M=\\max S$, which exists since $S$ is finite and $S\\subseteq\\mathbb{Z}$. Consider the edge $(M+1,M+2)\\in E$. Since $M+1M$ and $M+2M$, we have $M+1\\notin S$ and $M+2\\notin S$. Therefore $\\{M+1,M+2\\}\\cap S=\\emptyset$, so $(M+1,M+2)$ is uncovered.

If $S_{R}\\neq\\emptyset$, let $M=\\max S_{R}$. Then the edge $(M+1,M+2)$ remains in the right ray, and neither $M+1$ nor $M+2$ lies in $S_{R}$, hence not in $S$, so $(M+1,M+2)$ is uncovered.

If $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ are adjacent, then $|a-c|=1$, so $a$ and $c$ have opposite parity. Consequently, adjacent vertices receive different colors under this rule.
