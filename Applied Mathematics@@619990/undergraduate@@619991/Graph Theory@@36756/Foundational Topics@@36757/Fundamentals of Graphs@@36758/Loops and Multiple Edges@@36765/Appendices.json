By working through a practical scenario involving a data network, you will solidify your understanding of how to calculate edge counts in these more complex graphs [@problem_id:1519592].", "problem": "A small, experimental network consists of five specialized data centers. These centers are interconnected by high-speed data links. The network's design allows for a data center to have a link connecting back to itself for internal diagnostics (this is called a loop), and it also permits multiple parallel links between any two distinct centers for redundancy.\n\nThis network can be modeled as a pseudograph where the data centers are the vertices and the links are the edges. The \"degree\" of a data center (vertex) is defined as the total number of link endpoints connected to it. Therefore, a standard link between two different centers contributes 1 to the degree of each of the two centers, while a diagnostic loop on a single center contributes 2 to the degree of that center.\n\nA network audit reveals that the degrees of the five data centers are, in no particular order, 4, 4, 3, 3, and 2. Given this information, determine the total number of data links (edges) in the entire network. Note that each loop is counted as a single link.", "solution": "We model the network as a pseudograph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. In a pseudograph, the handshaking lemma still applies:\n$$\n\\sum_{v \\in V} \\deg(v) = 2|E|.\n$$\nThis holds because each ordinary edge contributes $1$ to the degree of each of its two endpoints (total contribution $2$), and each loop contributes $2$ to the degree of its single endpoint while counting as one edge, thereby also contributing $2$ to the left-hand side per edge.\n\nThe given degrees are $4,4,3,3,2$, so\n$$\n\\sum_{v \\in V} \\deg(v) = 4+4+3+3+2 = 16.\n$$\nApplying the handshaking lemma,\n$$\n16 = 2|E| \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad |E| = 8.\n$$\nThus, the total number of data links (edges), counting each loop as one edge, is $8$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "1519592"}, {"introduction": "Now, let's explore a critical distinction that arises when we introduce loops and multiple edges. In simple graphs, a vertex's degree is equal to its number of neighbors, but this is not always true for multigraphs and pseudographs.

Consider the following definitions:\n- A **simple graph** is a graph in which any two distinct vertices are connected by at most one edge, and no vertex is connected to itself by an edge (a loop).\n- A **multigraph** is a graph that may have multiple edges connecting the same two vertices, but does not allow loops.\n- A **pseudograph** is a graph that allows both multiple edges between vertices and loops on a single vertex.\n\nThe **degree** of a vertex is the number of edge ends incident to it. It is important to note that a loop at a vertex contributes 2 to its degree. Two vertices are considered **adjacent** if there is at least one edge connecting them.\n\nAn engineer is modeling a communication network.

Thus the configuration is impossible in a simple graph.\n\nMultigraph: In a multigraph there are no loops but multiple edges are allowed.

We need to find two quantities from the adjacency matrix $A$: the total number of edges $E$, and the sum of degrees for vertices with odd degree, $D_{odd}$.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of edges, $E$. The total number of edges is the sum of the number of non-loop edges and the number of loops.\nThe number of non-loop edges is given by the sum of the elements in the upper (or lower, since the matrix is symmetric) triangle of the adjacency matrix $A$. Let's denote this by $E_{\\text{non-loop}}$.\n$$ E_{\\text{non-loop}} = \\sum_{i<j} A_{ij} = A_{12} + A_{13} + A_{14} + A_{23} + A_{24} + A_{34} $$\nSubstituting the values from the matrix $A$:\n$$ E_{\\text{non-loop}} = 3 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 12 $$\nThe number of loops, denoted by $L$, is the sum of the diagonal elements of the adjacency matrix.\n$$ L = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} A_{ii} = A_{11} + A_{22} + A_{33} + A_{44} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ L = 2 + 0 + 1 + 3 = 6 $$\nThe total number of edges $E$ is the sum of the non-loop edges and the loops:\n$$ E = E_{\\text{non-loop}} + L = 12 + 6 = 18 $$\n\nNext, we need to find the degree of each vertex. The degree of a vertex $v_i$, $\\deg(v_i)$, is the sum of the non-diagonal elements in its corresponding row (or column) plus twice its diagonal element, as each loop contributes 2 to the degree. The formula is $\\deg(v_i) = \\left(\\sum_{j \\neq i} A_{ij}\\right) + 2A_{ii}$. Let's calculate the degree for each vertex in $V = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\\}$:\nFor $v_1$:\n$$ \\deg(v_1) = (A_{12} + A_{13} + A_{14}) + 2A_{11} = (3 + 0 + 1) + 2(2) = 4 + 4 = 8 $$\nFor $v_2$:\n$$ \\deg(v_2) = (A_{21} + A_{23} + A_{24}) + 2A_{22} = (3 + 2 + 2) + 2(0) = 7 + 0 = 7 $$\nFor $v_3$:\n$$ \\deg(v_3) = (A_{31} + A_{32} + A_{34}) + 2A_{33} = (0 + 2 + 4) + 2(1) = 6 + 2 = 8 $$\nFor $v_4$:\n$$ \\deg(v_4) = (A_{41} + A_{42} + A_{43}) + 2A_{44} = (1 + 2 + 4) + 2(3) = 7 + 6 = 13 $$\n\nThe degrees of the vertices are $\\{8, 7, 8, 13\\}$. We now identify the vertices that have an odd degree.

Let's verify this for our graph:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\deg(v_i) = 8 + 7 + 8 + 13 = 36 $$\nAnd we calculated $2E = 2(18) = 36$. The lemma holds, which gives us confidence in our calculations. Furthermore, if we let $D_{even}$ be the sum of the even degrees, the Handshaking Lemma implies $D_{even} + D_{odd} = 2E$. The expression we are asked to calculate is $2E - D_{odd}$, which is equivalent to $D_{even}$. The vertices with even degrees are $v_1$ and $v_3$, with degrees 8 and 8 respectively.
