A complete graph on $n$ vertices, denoted $K_n$, is a simple undirected graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. A cycle graph on $m$ vertices, denoted $C_m$, consists of $m$ vertices $u_1, u_2, \\dots, u_m$ and edges $(u_1, u_2), (u_2, u_3), \\dots, (u_{m-1}, u_m), (u_m, u_1)$.\n\nLet $G$ be the complete graph $K_6$ with the vertex set $V = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5, v_6\\}$. A new graph $H$ is formed by taking the graph $G$ and removing a specific set of edges.

The program is structured such that a direct link can only be established between a Mentor and a Mentee. No links are permitted between two Mentors or between two Mentees. Furthermore, any given pair of a Mentor and a Mentee can have at most one link between them.\n\nThe program currently has a total of 13 participants available. The organizers have the freedom to assign each participant to either the Mentor group or the Mentee group. To maximize networking opportunities, they want to configure the groups in such a way that the total number of possible unique links is as large as possible.\n\nAssuming that at least one person must be in each group, what is the maximum possible number of unique links that can be established in the program?", "solution": "Let the number of Mentors be $x$ and the number of Mentees be $13-x$, with the constraint $1 \\leq x \\leq 12$ to ensure each group is nonempty. A link can only connect a Mentor to a Mentee, and at most one link is allowed per such pair. Therefore, for a given split $(x,13-x)$, the maximum number of unique links is achieved by the complete bipartite graph between the two groups, yielding\n$$\nL(x)=x(13-x).\n$$\nTo maximize $L(x)$ over integers $x \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,12\\}$, rewrite by completing the square:\n$$\nL(x)=13x - x^{2} = -\\left(x - \\frac{13}{2}\\right)^{2} + \\frac{169}{4}.\n$$\nThe quadratic attains its maximum at $x=\\frac{13}{2}$; under the integer constraint, the maximizers are $x=6$ or $x=7$.

The vertices of $G$ are the 3-element subsets of the set $S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. The number of ways to choose a subset of 3 elements from a set of 6 elements is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ with $n=6$ and $k=3$.\n$$|V(G)| = \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20$$\nSo, the order of the graph $G$ is 20.\n\nNext, we determine the size of the graph, which is the number of edges, denoted by $|E(G)|$. We can find the number of edges by first calculating the degree of an arbitrary vertex and then using the handshaking lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges: $ \\sum_{v \\in V(G)} \\deg(v) = 2|E(G)| $.\n\nLet's pick an arbitrary vertex $v \\in V(G)$. This vertex corresponds to a 3-element subset of $S$. Let's call this subset $A$. Without loss of generality, let $A = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. The degree of vertex $v$, $\\deg(v)$, is the number of other vertices $u$ (corresponding to subset $B$) such that an edge exists between $v$ and $u$. The condition for an edge is $|A \\cap B| = 1$.\n\nTo find the number of such subsets $B$, we can construct them by following these steps:\n1.  Choose one element from $A$ that will also be in $B$. There are $\\binom{3}{1}$ ways to do this. Let this chosen element be $x$.\n2.  The remaining two elements of $B$ must be chosen from the elements in $S$ that are not in $A$. The set of these elements is $S \\setminus A = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\setminus \\{1, 2, 3\\} = \\{4, 5, 6\\}$.\n3.  Choose two elements from the 3-element set $S \\setminus A$. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{3}{2}$.\n\nBy the multiplication principle, the number of subsets $B$ that satisfy the condition $|A \\cap B| = 1$ is the product of the number of ways to perform each step.\n$$\\deg(v) = \\binom{3}{1} \\times \\binom{3}{2} = 3 \\times \\frac{3!}{2!1!} = 3 \\times 3 = 9$$\nSince the choice of the initial vertex $v$ (and its corresponding subset $A$) was arbitrary, every vertex in the graph has the same degree. Thus, the graph $G$ is a 9-regular graph.\n\nNow, we use the handshaking lemma. The sum of the degrees is the number of vertices multiplied by the degree of each vertex.\n$$\\sum_{v \\in V(G)} \\deg(v) = |V(G)| \\times \\deg(v) = 20 \\times 9 = 180$$\nAccording to the lemma, this sum is equal to twice the number of edges:\n$$2|E(G)| = 180$$\n$$|E(G)| = \\frac{180}{2} = 90$$\nSo, the size of the graph $G$ is 90.\n\nThe order of the graph is 20, and the size is 90.
