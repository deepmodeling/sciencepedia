You are asked to determine the maximum number of edges a graph can have while remaining disconnected, a question with implications for designing networks that are both internally well-connected and fragmented. Solving this problem requires you to think critically about how the arrangement of vertices into components affects the overall edge count.

The network is modeled as a simple graph where employees are vertices and a direct communication link is an edge. A key design constraint is that the network must be 'fragmented', meaning it must be disconnected. This ensures that a local network failure in one part of the company does not compromise communication across the entire company. To maximize the number of direct communication channels available within the network fragments, the administrator needs to determine the maximum possible number of edges (links) the graph can have while remaining disconnected.\n\nFind a closed-form expression for this maximum number of edges in terms of $n$.", "solution": "Let $G$ be a simple graph with $n$ vertices. The problem asks for the maximum number of edges in $G$ given that $G$ is disconnected.\n\nA graph is disconnected if it consists of two or more connected components. Let the graph $G$ have $k$ connected components, where $k \\ge 2$. Let the number of vertices in these components be $n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_k$, respectively. Since every vertex must belong to exactly one component, we have the constraint that $n_1 + n_2 + \\dots + n_k = n$, with $n_i \\ge 1$ for all $i=1, \\dots, k$.\n\nTo maximize the total number of edges in $G$, we should maximize the number of edges within each of its connected components. For a component with $n_i$ vertices, the maximum number of edges it can contain is realized when it is a complete graph, denoted $K_{n_i}$. The number of edges in a complete graph with $n_i$ vertices is given by $\\binom{n_i}{2} = \\frac{n_i(n_i-1)}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of edges in our graph $G$ is the sum of the edges in each complete component:\n$$E = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\binom{n_i}{2}$$\nOur task is to maximize this sum $E$ subject to the constraints $k \\ge 2$, $n_i \\ge 1$ for all $i$, and $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i = n$.\n\nLet's consider how the number of edges changes as we vary the partition of vertices $(n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_k)$. Consider any two components with $n_a$ and $n_b$ vertices, where $n_a \\ge 1$ and $n_b \\ge 1$. Their contribution to the total number of edges is $\\binom{n_a}{2} + \\binom{n_b}{2}$. Now, let's see what happens if we change this partition to one with $n_a + n_b - 1$ vertices in one component and $1$ vertex in another. The total number of vertices, $n_a+n_b$, is conserved. The new contribution to the edge count would be $\\binom{n_a + n_b - 1}{2} + \\binom{1}{2}$.\n\nLet's compare these two quantities. Note that $\\binom{1}{2} = 0$.\nThe change in the number of edges is:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\binom{n_a + n_b - 1}{2} - \\left( \\binom{n_a}{2} + \\binom{n_b}{2} \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{(n_a + n_b - 1)(n_a + n_b - 2)}{2} - \\frac{n_a(n_a - 1)}{2} - \\frac{n_b(n_b - 1)}{2} $$\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (n_a^2 + 2n_an_b - 3n_a - 3n_b + n_b^2 + 2) - (n_a^2 - n_a) - (n_b^2 - n_b) \\right] $$\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 2n_an_b - 2n_a - 2n_b + 2 \\right] $$\n$$ \\Delta E = n_an_b - n_a - n_b + 1 $$\nThis expression can be factored:\n$$ \\Delta E = (n_a - 1)(n_b - 1) $$\nSince $n_a \\ge 1$ and $n_b \\ge 1$, we have $(n_a-1) \\ge 0$ and $(n_b-1) \\ge 0$. Therefore, $\\Delta E = (n_a - 1)(n_b - 1) \\ge 0$.\nThis means that taking a vertex from one component and adding it to another (while leaving the lone vertex as its own new component, which we can then merge with another singleton) never decreases the number of edges. The number of edges strictly increases if both original components had more than one vertex ($n_a  1$ and $n_b  1$).\n\nThis result implies that to maximize the total number of edges, we should consolidate as many vertices as possible into a single component. Any partition with more than two components can have its edge count increased (or kept equal) by merging components until only two remain. For example, a partition $(n_1, n_2, n_3)$ can be formed into $(n_1+n_2-1, n_3, 1)$, increasing the edge count.\n\nSo, the maximum number of edges will be achieved when there are exactly two components ($k=2$). Let their sizes be $n_1$ and $n_2$, where $n_1+n_2=n$ and $n_1, n_2 \\ge 1$. The total number of edges is $E = \\binom{n_1}{2} + \\binom{n_2}{2}$.\nTo maximize this sum, we need to make one partition size as large as possible and the other as small as possible. The smallest possible component size is $n_i=1$.\nThus, the optimal partition is one component of size $n-1$ and one component of size $1$.\n\nThe maximum number of edges is the sum of the edges in a complete graph $K_{n-1}$ and a complete graph $K_1$ (which is just an isolated vertex).\n$$ E_{max} = \\binom{n-1}{2} + \\binom{1}{2} $$\n$$ E_{max} = \\frac{(n-1)(n-1-1)}{2} + 0 $$\n$$ E_{max} = \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} $$\nThis configuration corresponds to a graph consisting of a complete subgraph on $n-1$ vertices and a single isolated vertex, which is indeed disconnected.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}}$$", "id": "1553959"}]}
