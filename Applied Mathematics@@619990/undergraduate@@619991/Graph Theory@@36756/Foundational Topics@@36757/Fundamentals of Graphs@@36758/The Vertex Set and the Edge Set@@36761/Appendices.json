The maximum possible sum is $5+6=11$. The prime numbers less than or equal to 11 are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.

Thus, statement C is true.\n\n**Statement A: The graph is bipartite.**\nA graph is bipartite if its vertices can be partitioned into two disjoint sets, $V_1$ and $V_2$, such that every edge connects a vertex in $V_1$ to one in $V_2$. This is equivalent to the graph having no odd-length cycles.\nLet's consider partitioning the vertices into odd and even numbers:\n$V_1 = \\{1, 3, 5\\}$ (odd vertices)\n$V_2 = \\{2, 4, 6\\}$ (even vertices)\n\n- The sum of two odd numbers is always even. Since the smallest sum of two distinct odd vertices is $1+3=4$, any sum of two odd vertices is an even number greater than 2, and therefore not prime. So, there are no edges within $V_1$.\n- The sum of two even numbers is always even. The smallest sum is $2+4=6$, so any sum of two even vertices is an even number greater than 2, and therefore not prime. So, there are no edges within $V_2$.\n- The sum of an odd and an even number is always odd. Odd numbers can be prime (e.g., 3, 5, 7, 11). All the edges we found, like $(1,2)$ with sum 3, must connect an odd vertex to an even vertex.\n\nSince all edges connect a vertex in $V_1$ to a vertex in $V_2$, the graph is bipartite with partitions $V_1$ and $V_2$. Thus, statement A is true.\n\n**Statement B: The graph contains a cycle of length 3.**\nA cycle of length 3 is an odd-length cycle. A fundamental property of bipartite graphs is that they contain no odd-length cycles. Since we have established that $G$ is bipartite, it cannot contain a cycle of length 3. Thus, statement B is false.\n\n**Statement D: The minimum degree of any vertex in the graph is 1.**\nThe degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it. Let's calculate the degree for each vertex from the edge set $E$:\n- $\\deg(1)$: Edges are (1,2), (1,4), (1,6). $\\deg(1) = 3$.\n- $\\deg(2)$: Edges are (1,2), (2,3), (2,5). $\\deg(2) = 3$.\n- $\\deg(3)$: Edges are (2,3), (3,4). $\\deg(3) = 2$.\n- $\\deg(4)$: Edges are (1,4), (3,4). $\\deg(4) = 2$.\n- $\\deg(5)$: Edges are (2,5), (5,6). $\\deg(5) = 2$.\n- $\\deg(6)$: Edges are (1,6), (5,6). $\\deg(6) = 2$.\nThe degrees of the vertices are $\\{3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2\\}$. The minimum degree in the graph is 2. Therefore, the statement that the minimum degree is 1 is false.\n\n**Statement E: The graph is connected.**\nA graph is connected if there is a path between any two of its vertices. Every vertex has a degree of at least 2, so there are no isolated vertices. The partitions are $V_1 = \\{1,3,5\\}$ and $V_2 = \\{2,4,6\\}$. Any two vertices in $V_1$ (e.g., 3 and 5) can be connected via a path of length 2 through a vertex in $V_2$ (e.g., $3-2-5$). Similarly, any two vertices in $V_2$ (e.g., 4 and 6) are connected via a vertex in $V_1$ (e.g., $4-1-6$). Since all vertices within each partition are connected to each other (via the other partition), and all partitions are linked by edges, the entire graph is connected. Thus, statement E is true.\n\nIn summary:\n- Statement A is true.\n- Statement B is false.\n- Statement C is true.\n- Statement D is false.\n- Statement E is true.\n\nThe true statements are A, C, and E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "1548199"}, {"introduction": "Graph theory serves as a powerful framework for modeling complex systems, from social networks to distributed computing.

The set of vertices $V$ is comprised of all possible binary strings of length 5. An edge exists in the set $E$ connecting two distinct vertices if and only if their Hamming distance is exactly 2. The Hamming distance between two binary strings is defined as the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different. For system analysis, it is necessary to quantify the number of minimal feedback loops. Your task is to calculate the total number of distinct 3-cycles (triangles) present in this graph $G$.", "solution": "A 3-cycle, or a triangle, in the graph $G$ is a set of three distinct vertices $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$ where each pair of vertices is connected by an edge. This means the Hamming distance between any two vertices in the set is exactly 2.\nLet's find the number of such sets.\n\nWe can count the number of ordered triplets $(v_1, v_2, v_3)$ that form a triangle and then divide by the number of ways to order a set of three vertices to correct for overcounting.\n\nThe graph defined is vertex-transitive, meaning it looks the same from every vertex. This allows us to fix one vertex, perform the calculation, and then multiply by the total number of vertices.\n\nStep 1: Choose the first vertex, $v_1$.\nThe vertex set $V$ consists of all binary strings of length 5. The size of the vertex set is $|V| = 2^5 = 32$. We can fix $v_1$ to be the string `00000` without loss of generality.\n\nStep 2: Choose the second vertex, $v_2$.\n$v_2$ must be connected to $v_1$ by an edge, which means their Hamming distance must be 2. So, $d_H(v_1, v_2) = 2$. Since $v_1 = 00000$, $v_2$ must be a binary string with exactly two 1s. The number of ways to choose 2 positions for these 1s out of 5 available positions is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{5}{2}$.\nNumber of choices for $v_2 = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$.\nThis also tells us that the graph is 10-regular (every vertex has a degree of 10). Let's pick one such neighbor for our calculation, say $v_2 = 11000$.\n\nStep 3: Choose the third vertex, $v_3$.\n$v_3$ must form a triangle with $v_1$ and $v_2$. This requires $v_3$ to be connected to both $v_1$ and $v_2$.\n1.  $d_H(v_1, v_3) = 2$: Since $v_1 = 00000$, $v_3$ must also be a string with exactly two 1s.\n2.  $d_H(v_2, v_3) = 2$: $v_3$ must differ from $v_2 = 11000$ in exactly two positions.\n\nLet $I_2$ be the set of positions where $v_2$ has a '1', so $I_2 = \\{1, 2\\}$. Let $I_3$ be the set of positions where $v_3$ has a '1'. From condition 1, we know $|I_3| = 2$.\nThe Hamming distance between two binary strings can be calculated using the sets of their '1' positions as $d_H(v_2, v_3) = |I_2 \\Delta I_3|$, where $\\Delta$ is the symmetric difference. The size of the symmetric difference is given by $|I_2 \\Delta I_3| = |I_2| + |I_3| - 2|I_2 \\cap I_3|$.\nSubstituting the known values:\n$2 = 2 + 2 - 2|I_2 \\cap I_3|$\n$2 = 4 - 2|I_2 \\cap I_3|$\n$2|I_2 \\cap I_3| = 2$\n$|I_2 \\cap I_3| = 1$\n\nThis crucial result means that the set of '1' positions for $v_3$ must share exactly one element with the set of '1' positions for $v_2$.\nSo, to construct $v_3$, we must choose:\n- One position from $I_2 = \\{1, 2\\}$. There are $\\binom{2}{1} = 2$ ways.\n- One position from the complement of $I_2$, which is $\\{3, 4, 5\\}$. There are $\\binom{3}{1} = 3$ ways.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose the positions for the 1s in $v_3$ is $2 \\times 3 = 6$. So, for a fixed pair $(v_1, v_2)$, there are 6 possible choices for $v_3$ that complete a triangle.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total number of ordered triplets.\nWe can now find the total number of ordered triplets $(v_1, v_2, v_3)$ forming a triangle:\n- Number of choices for $v_1$: 32\n- Number of choices for $v_2$ (a neighbor of $v_1$): 10\n- Number of choices for $v_3$ (a common neighbor of $v_1$ and $v_2$): 6\nTotal ordered triplets = $32 \\times 10 \\times 6 = 1920$.\n\nStep 5: Correct for overcounting.\nEach unique triangle, being a set of three vertices $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$, is counted multiple times in our ordered triplet calculation. For any given set of three vertices, there are $3! = 6$ ways to order them into a triplet (e.g., $(v_1,v_2,v_3)$, $(v_1,v_3,v_2)$, $(v_2,v_1,v_3)$, etc.). All of these 6 orderings are counted in our total of 1920.\nTo find the number of distinct triangles, we must divide the total count of ordered triplets by 6.\nNumber of distinct triangles = $\\frac{1920}{6} = 320$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{320}$$", "id": "1548230"}]}
