However, as $y \\to 0$, the denominator approaches $0$, and $f_1'(y) \\to \\infty$. The derivative is undefined at $y=0$. Therefore, the function $f_1(y) = y^{1/3}$ is not differentiable at $y=0$, and consequently, it is not a $C^1$ function on its domain $\\mathbb{R}$.\nSince we have found one transition map that is not $C^1$, we can conclude that the atlases $\\mathcal{A}_{\\text{id}}$ and $\\mathcal{A}_{\\phi}$ are not $C^1$-compatible. This means they define different $C^1$ differentiable structures on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFor completeness, let's analyze the second transition map, $f_2 = \\phi \\circ \\text{id}^{-1}$.\nThe inverse of the identity map is the identity map itself: $\\text{id}^{-1}(y) = y$.\nThe domain of this transition map is $\\text{id}(U \\cap V) = \\text{id}(\\mathbb{R}) = \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe expression for this transition map is:\n$$f_2(y) = (\\phi \\circ \\text{id}^{-1})(y) = \\phi(\\text{id}^{-1}(y)) = \\phi(y) = y^3$$\nTo check if $f_2$ is a $C^1$ function, we compute its derivative:\n$$f_2'(y) = \\frac{d}{dy} (y^3) = 3y^2$$\nThe derivative $f_2'(y) = 3y^2$ is a continuous function for all $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Thus, $f_2(y) = y^3$ is a $C^1$ function. In fact, it is a $C^{\\infty}$ function (smooth).\n\nHowever, for the atlases to be compatible, *all* transition maps must be $C^1$. Since the map $f_1 = \\text{id} \\circ \\phi^{-1}$ fails this condition, the atlases are not $C^1$-compatible.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\nA. This is incorrect. The differentiability of the chart maps themselves is a necessary condition for them to be valid charts, but it is not sufficient for compatibility. The transition maps must be differentiable.\nB. This is correct. As shown above, the transition map $\\text{id} \\circ \\phi^{-1}$ evaluates to $y^{1/3}$, which is not differentiable at $y=0$.\nC. This is incorrect. The transition map $\\phi \\circ \\text{id}^{-1}$ is $y^3$, which is infinitely differentiable everywhere.\nD. This is incorrect. The function $\\phi(x) = x^3$ is a strictly increasing function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, which means it is injective. It is also surjective. Therefore, it is a bijection.\nE. This is incorrect. While the union of the atlases does cover $\\mathbb{R}$ (as each atlas alone already covers $\\mathbb{R}$), this is not the condition for compatibility.
