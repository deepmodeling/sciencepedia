The surface $S$ is a two-dimensional topological manifold. For this manifold, we can define a specific type of chart. Let the four vertices of the tetrahedron be labeled $V_1, V_2, V_3,$ and $V_4$. A chart is constructed such that its domain, denoted $U_i$, consists of the entire surface $S$ with a single vertex $V_i$ removed, i.e., $U_i = S \\setminus \\{V_i\\}$.
