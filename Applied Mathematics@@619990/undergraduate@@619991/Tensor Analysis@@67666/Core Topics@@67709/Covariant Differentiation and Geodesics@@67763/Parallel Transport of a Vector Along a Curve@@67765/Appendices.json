This is a minor flaw in the derivation, but the result `-exp(2v)` is correct. Given the \"minimalist principle,\" I will leave this as is, since the final formula for the Christoffel symbol is correct, and the subsequent steps are also correct.\n\nThe solution continues:\nDifferentiate the first equation: $\\frac{d^2A^u}{du^2} + \\frac{dA^v}{du} = 0$.\nSubstitute $\\frac{dA^v}{du} = e^{2v_0}A^u$ from the second equation: $\\frac{d^2A^u}{du^2} + e^{2v_0}A^u = 0$.\nThis is correct.\nThus, $k(v_0) = \\exp(2v_0)$.
