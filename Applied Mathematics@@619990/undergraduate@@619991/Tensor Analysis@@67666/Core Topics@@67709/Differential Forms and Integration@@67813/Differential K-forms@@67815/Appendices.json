Stokes' theorem for a smooth $k$-form $\\omega$ on a compact, oriented $(k+1)$-dimensional manifold-with-boundary $M$ states that $\\int_{M} d\\omega = \\int_{\\partial M} \\omega$. In our case, $M=\\Omega$ is a $2$-dimensional manifold-with-boundary, and $\\omega=\\alpha$ is a $1$-form. The theorem thus states $\\int_{\\Omega} d\\alpha = \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} \\alpha$. We will compute both sides of this equation independently.\n\nPart 1: Computation of the boundary integral $\\int_{\\partial\\Omega} j^{*}(x\\,dy)$.\n\nThe boundary of the disk $\\Omega$ is the unit circle $\\partial\\Omega = \\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid x^{2}+y^{2}=1\\}$. The standard orientation on $\\Omega$ is given by the $2$-form $dx\\wedge dy$. The induced orientation on the boundary $\\partial\\Omega$ is the counterclockwise orientation.

The components are $x(t) = \\cos(t)$ and $y(t) = \\sin(t)$.\n\nThe integral of the $1$-form $j^{*}(\\alpha)$ over $\\partial\\Omega$ is found by pulling back the form to the parameter domain $[0, 2\\pi]$ via the map $\\gamma$. The pullback $\\gamma^{*}(j^{*}(\\alpha))$ is equivalent to $\\gamma^{*}(\\alpha)$ since $\\gamma$ maps into the boundary. We compute the pullback $\\gamma^{*}(x\\,dy)$:\nThe function $x$ pulls back to $\\gamma^{*}x = x(\\gamma(t)) = \\cos(t)$.\nThe $1$-form $dy$ pulls back to $\\gamma^{*}(dy) = d(\\gamma^{*}y) = d(\\sin(t))$.\nUsing the rules of differentiation, $d(\\sin(t)) = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\sin(t))\\,dt = \\cos(t)\\,dt$.\nTherefore, the pullback of the entire form $\\alpha=x\\,dy$ is:\n$$\n\\gamma^{*}(\\alpha) = (\\gamma^{*}x) \\wedge (\\gamma^{*}dy) = \\cos(t) (\\cos(t)\\,dt) = \\cos^{2}(t)\\,dt\n$$\nNow, we can evaluate the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{\\partial\\Omega} j^{*}(x\\,dy) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\gamma^{*}(x\\,dy) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\cos^{2}(t)\\,dt\n$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we use the trigonometric identity $\\cos^{2}(t) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\cos(2t))$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\cos(2t))\\,dt = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ t + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(2t) \\right]_{0}^{2\\pi}\n$$\nEvaluating the expression at the limits of integration:\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\left( 2\\pi + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(4\\pi) \\right) - \\left( 0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(0) \\right) \\right]\n$$\nSince $\\sin(4\\pi) = 0$ and $\\sin(0) = 0$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} (2\\pi - 0) = \\pi\n$$\nThus, the value of the boundary integral is $\\pi$.\n\nPart 2: Computation of the interior integral $\\int_{\\Omega} d(x\\,dy)$.\n\nFirst, we compute the exterior derivative of the $1$-form $\\alpha = x\\,dy$. The exterior derivative operator $d$ has the property $d(f\\omega) = df \\wedge \\omega + f \\,d\\omega$ for a $0$-form (function) $f$ and a $k$-form $\\omega$. In our case, $f=x$ and $\\omega=dy$.\n$$\nd(x\\,dy) = dx \\wedge dy + x \\wedge d(dy)\n$$\nThe coordinate function $y$ is a $0$-form, so $dy$ is its exterior derivative. A fundamental property of the exterior derivative is that $d^{2} = 0$. Applying this, we have $d(dy) = d(d(y)) = 0$.\nTherefore, the exterior derivative of $\\alpha$ is:\n$$\nd\\alpha = d(x\\,dy) = dx \\wedge dy + x \\wedge 0 = dx \\wedge dy\n$$\nNow, we must compute the integral of this $2$-form over the unit disk $\\Omega$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} d(x\\,dy) = \\int_{\\Omega} dx \\wedge dy\n$$\nThe $2$-form $dx \\wedge dy$ is the standard area form on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The integral of the area form over a region gives the area of that region. The region $\\Omega$ is a disk of radius $r=1$. The area of a disk with radius $r$ is given by the formula $A = \\pi r^{2}$.\nFor $\\Omega$, with $r=1$, the area is $\\pi (1)^{2} = \\pi$.\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} dx \\wedge dy = \\text{Area}(\\Omega) = \\pi\n$$\nAlternatively, one could compute this integral by changing to polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, where $x=r\\cos(\\theta)$ and $y=r\\sin(\\theta)$. The form $dx \\wedge dy$ becomes $r\\,dr \\wedge d\\theta$. The domain $\\Omega$ is described by $0 \\le r \\le 1$ and $0 \\le \\theta \\le 2\\pi$.
