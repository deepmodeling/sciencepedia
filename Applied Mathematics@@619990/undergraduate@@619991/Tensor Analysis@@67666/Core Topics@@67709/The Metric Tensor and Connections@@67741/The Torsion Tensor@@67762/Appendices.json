Present your answer as a four-component row vector $(k_0, i_0, j_0, c)$.", "solution": "The problem asks us to find the indices $(k_0, i_0, j_0)$ and the value $c$ of the single non-zero Christoffel symbol, $\\Gamma^{k_0}_{i_0 j_0} = c$, that produces a specific torsion tensor.\n\nThe components of the torsion tensor are given by $T^k_{ij} = \\Gamma^k_{ij} - \\Gamma^k_{ji}$.\nWe are given that exactly one Christoffel symbol is non-zero. Let this be $\\Gamma^{k_0}_{i_0 j_0} = c$, where $c \\neq 0$. All other Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are zero.\n\nWe analyze the resulting torsion tensor components based on this assumption. The component $T^k_{ij}$ can only be non-zero if at least one of the terms $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ or $\\Gamma^k_{ji}$ is non-zero. Since only $\\Gamma^{k_0}_{i_0 j_0}$ is non-zero, we only need to check the torsion components related to the indices $(k_0, i_0, j_0)$.\n\nLet's consider two cases for the lower indices $i_0$ and $j_0$.\n\nCase 1: $i_0 = j_0$.\nIn this case, the single non-zero Christoffel symbol is of the form $\\Gamma^{k_0}_{i_0 i_0} = c$. The torsion component with these indices is:\n$$T^{k_0}_{i_0 i_0} = \\Gamma^{k_0}_{i_0 i_0} - \\Gamma^{k_0}_{i_0 i_0} = c - c = 0$$\nSince all other Christoffel symbols are zero, any other torsion component $T^k_{ij}$ will also be zero. This means that if $i_0 = j_0$, the torsion tensor is identically zero. This contradicts the given condition $T^3_{12} = 1$. Therefore, we must have $i_0 \\neq j_0$.\n\nCase 2: $i_0 \\neq j_0$.\nThe single non-zero Christoffel symbol is $\\Gamma^{k_0}_{i_0 j_0} = c$. Since $i_0 \\neq j_0$, the indices $(k_0, j_0, i_0)$ are different from $(k_0, i_0, j_0)$. By the problem's constraint, this means the Christoffel symbol with the permuted lower indices, $\\Gamma^{k_0}_{j_0 i_0}$, must be zero.\n\nLet's compute the torsion components related to these indices:\nFirst, for the indices $(k_0, i_0, j_0)$:\n$$T^{k_0}_{i_0 j_0} = \\Gamma^{k_0}_{i_0 j_0} - \\Gamma^{k_0}_{j_0 i_0} = c - 0 = c$$\nSecond, for the indices $(k_0, j_0, i_0)$:\n$$T^{k_0}_{j_0 i_0} = \\Gamma^{k_0}_{j_0 i_0} - \\Gamma^{k_0}_{i_0 j_0} = 0 - c = -c$$\nFor any other set of indices $(k, i, j)$, neither $(k,i,j)$ nor $(k,j,i)$ can be equal to $(k_0, i_0, j_0)$. Thus, both $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ and $\\Gamma^k_{ji}$ are zero, which implies $T^k_{ij} = 0 - 0 = 0$.\n\nSo, the connection defined by a single non-zero $\\Gamma^{k_0}_{i_0 j_0} = c$ with $i_0 \\neq j_0$ produces exactly two non-zero torsion components: $T^{k_0}_{i_0 j_0} = c$ and $T^{k_0}_{j_0 i_0} = -c$.\n\nThe problem states that the torsion tensor has the component $T^3_{12} = 1$ and that all other independent components $T^k_{ij}$ with $i < j$ are zero.\nOur analysis shows that there is only one non-zero independent component, which we can take to be $T^{k_0}_{i_0 j_0} = c$ by adopting the convention $i_0 < j_0$.\n\nBy comparing our derived non-zero component with the given condition, we can identify the indices and the constant:\n$$\nT^{k_0}_{i_0 j_0} = T^3_{12}\n$$\nThis gives us:\n$k_0 = 3$\n$i_0 = 1$\n$j_0 = 2$\nAnd the value of the component gives:\n$c = 1$\n\nThis set of indices satisfies the condition $i_0 \\neq j_0$ (since $1 \\neq 2$) and defines the convention $i_0 < j_0$, consistent with how independent components are specified.\nSo, the single non-zero Christoffel symbol must be $\\Gamma^3_{12} = 1$.\n\nLet's verify this result. If $\\Gamma^3_{12} = 1$ and all other $\\Gamma^k_{ij}=0$:\n- $T^3_{12} = \\Gamma^3_{12} - \\Gamma^3_{21} = 1 - 0 = 1$. This matches the condition.\n- Any other independent component $T^k_{ij}$ with $i<j$ (e.g., $T^1_{23}, T^2_{13}$, etc.) will be zero because the corresponding Christoffel symbols are zero. This also matches the conditions.\n\nThe indices are $(k_0, i_0, j_0) = (3, 1, 2)$ and the constant is $c=1$.\nThe final answer must be presented as the row vector $(k_0, i_0, j_0, c)$.\nThe vector is $(3, 1, 2, 1)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1685033"}, {"introduction": "A key property of tensors is that their components transform in a specific, predictable way when the coordinate system is changed.
