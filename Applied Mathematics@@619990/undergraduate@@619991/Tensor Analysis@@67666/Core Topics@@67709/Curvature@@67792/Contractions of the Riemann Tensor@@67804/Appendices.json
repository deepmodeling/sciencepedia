This exercise [@problem_id:1498492] challenges you to think critically about the relationship between the Ricci tensor, $R_{\\mu\\nu}$, and the Ricci scalar, $R$. By considering which geometric scenarios are mathematically possible and which are contradictory, you will reinforce the core principle that the Ricci scalar is a direct contraction of the Ricci tensor, a concept that underpins much of differential geometry.", "problem": "In the study of differential geometry and general relativity, the curvature of a manifold is described by the Riemann curvature tensor, $R_{\\rho\\sigma\\mu\\nu}$. By performing contractions on this tensor, one can define simpler objects that still capture essential information about the geometry. The first contraction yields the Ricci tensor, defined as $R_{\\mu\\nu} = R^{\\rho}_{\\,\\,\\mu\\rho\\nu}$ (using the Einstein summation convention). A further contraction of the Ricci tensor with the inverse metric tensor, $g^{\\mu\\nu}$, defines the Ricci scalar, $R = g^{\\mu\\nu} R_{\\mu\\nu}$.\n\nA theoretical physicist is investigating several hypothetical $n$-dimensional spacetimes (where $n \\geq 2$) and proposes a list of possible curvature properties for these manifolds. Each property is described in terms of the relationships between the Riemann tensor, the Ricci tensor, and the Ricci scalar. One of these proposed scenarios is fundamentally impossible due to the mathematical definitions of these quantities.\n\nWhich of the following scenarios describes a mathematically inconsistent spacetime?\n\nA. A spacetime where the Riemann curvature tensor $R_{\\rho\\sigma\\mu\\nu}$ is non-zero, but the Ricci tensor $R_{\\mu\\nu}$ is zero for all components.\n\nB. A spacetime where the Ricci tensor $R_{\\mu\\nu}$ is zero for all components, but the Ricci scalar $R$ is a non-zero constant.\n\nC.

The Ricci tensor is defined by contracting the Riemann tensor on one upper and one lower index:\n$$\nR_{\\mu\\nu} = R^{\\rho}_{\\ \\mu\\rho\\nu}.\n$$\nThe Ricci scalar is the metric contraction (trace) of the Ricci tensor:\n$$\nR = g^{\\mu\\nu} R_{\\mu\\nu}.\n$$\nThese are linear contractions; in particular, if $R_{\\mu\\nu}=0$, then substituting into the definition of $R$ gives\n$$\nR = g^{\\mu\\nu} R_{\\mu\\nu} = g^{\\mu\\nu} \\cdot 0 = 0.\n$$\n\nNow evaluate each scenario against these definitions.\n\nA. Non-zero $R_{\\rho\\sigma\\mu\\nu}$ with $R_{\\mu\\nu}=0$: This is consistent with the definitions, since a tensor can have vanishing trace while being non-zero. In dimensions $n \\geq 3$, the Riemann tensor decomposes into the Weyl tensor plus terms built from the Ricci tensor and scalar; setting $R_{\\mu\\nu}=0$ allows a non-zero Weyl tensor and hence a non-zero Riemann tensor. Thus this is not mathematically inconsistent (though in $n=2$ such a situation cannot occur, it is allowed for $n \\geq 3$ and hence is not fundamentally inconsistent with the definitions).\n\nB. $R_{\\mu\\nu}=0$ but $R$ a non-zero constant: Substituting $R_{\\mu\\nu}=0$ into $R = g^{\\mu\\nu} R_{\\mu\\nu}$ yields $R=0$. Therefore asserting $R \\neq 0$ contradicts the defining contraction. This is mathematically inconsistent for any $n \\geq 2$.\n\nC. $R_{\\mu\\nu} \\neq 0$ but $R=0$: This demands a symmetric, trace-free Ricci tensor. This is consistent with the definition $R = g^{\\mu\\nu} R_{\\mu\\nu}$, which merely states that the trace vanishes; a tensor can be trace-free yet non-zero. Such spacetimes exist for $n \\geq 3$ (for example, solutions sourced by trace-free matter). In $n=2$ one has $R_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g_{\\mu\\nu} R$, so $R=0$ would force $R_{\\mu\\nu}=0$, but the scenario is not inherently inconsistent with the definitions for general $n$.\n\nD. $R_{\\rho\\sigma\\mu\\nu}=0$: This is a flat spacetime. Contracting a zero Riemann tensor gives $R_{\\mu\\nu}=0$ and hence $R=0$. There is no inconsistency.\n\nTherefore, only scenario B contradicts the defining relation between $R$ and $R_{\\mu\\nu}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1498492"}, {"introduction": "Theory comes to life when applied to concrete examples.
