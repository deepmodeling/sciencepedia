Without using any symmetries there are $4 \\times 4 = 16$ such components.\n\nUse the antisymmetry in the last pair: $R_{12ab} = - R_{12ba}$. This immediately implies $R_{12aa} = 0$ for each $a$, and we only need to consider antisymmetric pairs $[ab]$ with $a<b$. In four dimensions, the antisymmetric pairs are\n$$\n[12],\\ [13],\\ [14],\\ [23],\\ [24],\\ [34],\n$$\nso naively this leaves the six components\n$$\nR_{1212},\\ R_{1213},\\ R_{1214},\\ R_{1223},\\ R_{1224},\\ R_{1234}.\n$$\n\nNext, check whether the other algebraic symmetries create relations among these six:\n\n1) Antisymmetry in the first pair, $R_{abcd}=-R_{bacd}$, does not relate any two different entries within the set $R_{12ab}$, because the first pair is fixed as $(1,2)$; it only relates $R_{12ab}$ to $R_{21ab}=-R_{12ab}$, which lies outside the restricted set.\n\n2) Pair interchange symmetry, $R_{abcd}=R_{cdab}$, gives $R_{12ab}=R_{ab12}$. For $[ab]\\neq[12]$, the right-hand side has first pair $ab\\neq 12$ and so lies outside the restricted set; for $[ab]=[12]$ it is the tautology $R_{1212}=R_{1212}$. Thus, within the restricted set, this symmetry does not relate distinct components.\n\n3) First Bianchi identity, $R_{abcd}+R_{acdb}+R_{adbc}=0$, with $a=1$ and $b=2$ reads\n$$\nR_{12cd} + R_{1c d 2} + R_{1d 2 c} = 0.\n$$\nFor $c,d$ neither equal to $1$ nor $2$, the last two terms involve first pairs $1c$ and $1d$, not equal to $12$, so they do not produce relations among only the $R_{12cd}$. For cases with $c$ or $d$ equal to $1$ or $2$, the identity reduces to trivial equalities using antisymmetries. For example:\n- With $c=1$, $d=3$, one has\n$$\nR_{1213} + R_{1132} + R_{1321} = 0,\n$$\nwhere $R_{1132}=0$ (first-pair antisymmetry) and $R_{1321}=-R_{1213}$ (pair interchange and antisymmetry), yielding $R_{1213} - R_{1213} = 0$.\n- With $c=2$, $d=3$, one has\n$$\nR_{1223} + R_{1232} + R_{1322} = 0,\n$$\nwhere $R_{1232}=-R_{1223}$ (last-pair antisymmetry) and $R_{1322}=0$ (last-pair antisymmetry), yielding $R_{1223} - R_{1223} = 0$.\nThus, the Bianchi identity imposes no nontrivial relations within the set $\\{R_{12ab}\\}$.\n\nSince none of these symmetries relate distinct members of the six listed components, and none of them is forced to vanish by antisymmetry (note in particular that $R_{1212}$ can be nonzero in general), the maximum number of potentially non-zero and independent components of the form $R_{12ab}$ is exactly the number of antisymmetric pairs $[ab]$ in four dimensions, which is $6$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "1623323"}, {"introduction": "The principles for counting tensor components are universal and extend beyond the specific case of the Riemann tensor.
