This thought experiment invites you to become an ant-geometer on a cylinder, using the tool of parallel transport to probe your world. By considering what happens to a vector carried along a closed path, you will uncover the crucial difference between the way a surface is embedded in higher-dimensional space (extrinsic curvature) and the geometry experienced by its inhabitants, which is governed by the Riemann tensor [@problem_id:1515232].", "problem": "An ant, who is an amateur geometer, lives on the surface of a vast, hollow cylinder of radius $R$. To investigate the geometry of its world, the ant performs a classic experiment. It starts at a point $P$ on the cylinder's surface and carefully defines a local \"forward\" direction with a small pointer, which can be represented by a tangent vector $V_i$. The ant then walks along a closed, piecewise-smooth path that eventually returns to the starting point $P$. Throughout its journey, the ant ensures its pointer is never twisted or turned relative to its path, a process known as parallel transport. Upon returning to $P$, the ant compares the final orientation of its pointer, represented by the vector $V_f$, with its initial orientation $V_i$.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate description of the experiment's outcome and its underlying geometric principle?\n\nA. The final vector $V_f$ will be different from the initial vector $V_i$. This is a necessary consequence of the cylinder being a curved surface embedded in three-dimensional space; this extrinsic curvature dictates the rules of parallel transport.\n\nB. The final vector $V_f$ will be identical to the initial vector $V_i$. This is because the surface of the cylinder is intrinsically flat, a property signified by its Riemann curvature tensor being zero everywhere.\n\nC. The final vector $V_f$ will be identical to the initial vector $V_i$, but only if the closed path is formed by segments of geodesics (the \"straightest possible lines\" on the surface).\n\nD. The final vector $V_f$ will be different from the initial vector $V_i$. The angle of rotation between $V_f$ and $V_i$ will be directly proportional to the area enclosed by the closed path on the cylinder's surface.\n\nE. The outcome depends on the path taken. If the loop does not go all the way around the cylinder's circumference, $V_f$ will be identical to $V_i$. If the loop does encircle the cylinder, $V_f$ will be different from $V_i$.", "solution": "Let $C$ denote the cylindrical surface of radius $R$. Use coordinates $(\\theta,z)$ induced by the embedding $(R\\cos\\theta,R\\sin\\theta,z)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. The induced metric on $C$ is\n$$\nds^{2} = R^{2}\\,d\\theta^{2} + dz^{2}.\n$$\nDefine the unwrapping map $\\pi:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\to C$ by\n$$\n\\pi(x,y) = \\big(\\theta = x/R \\bmod 2\\pi,\\; z=y\\big).\n$$\nUnder the change of variables $x=R\\theta$, $y=z$, the metric becomes\n$$\nds^{2} = dx^{2} + dy^{2},\n$$\nwhich is the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Therefore, the cylinder is locally isometric to the Euclidean plane, and its Levi-Civita connection is the pullback of the flat Euclidean connection. In these $(x,y)$ coordinates the Christoffel symbols vanish:\n$$\n\\Gamma^{i}_{jk} = 0,\n$$\nhence the Riemann curvature tensor vanishes identically:\n$$\nR^{i}{}_{jkl} = 0.\n$$\nParallel transport along a curve $\\gamma$ is defined by the condition that a tangent vector field $V$ along $\\gamma$ satisfies\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} V = 0.\n$$\nIn the flat coordinates $(x,y)$ this reduces to the ordinary differential equation\n$$\n\\frac{dV^{i}}{dt} = 0,\n$$\nso $V^{i}$ are constant along the lifted curve in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Consequently, in the plane, parallel transport preserves the vector exactly along any path and around any closed loop.\n\nNow consider a closed loop $\\gamma$ on the cylinder and lift it to a curve $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ under $\\pi$. If $\\gamma$ is contractible, then $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ is a closed loop; if $\\gamma$ winds $k$ times around the cylinder, then $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ has endpoints differing by a deck transformation\n$$\nT_{k}(x,y) = (x + 2\\pi R k,\\, y).\n$$\nParallel transport in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ yields $\\tilde{V}_{f} = \\tilde{V}_{i}$ because $\\Gamma^{i}_{jk}=0$. Pushing forward by $d\\pi$ at the endpoints gives the transported vectors on the cylinder. Since $dT_{k}$ is the identity linear map, the identification under the covering does not alter the tangent vector:\n$$\nV_{f} = d\\pi\\big(\\tilde{V}_{f}\\big) = d\\pi\\big(\\tilde{V}_{i}\\big) = V_{i}.\n$$\nTherefore, for any closed loop on the cylinder, whether or not it wraps around the circumference, parallel transport returns the vector to its initial orientation. This shows that holonomy is trivial on the cylinder.\n\nThis directly refutes statements that attribute the outcome to extrinsic curvature (parallel transport is determined by the intrinsic Levi-Civita connection), or that claim dependence on enclosed area (the Gaussian curvature is zero everywhere, so there is no curvature-induced rotation), or that restrict trivial holonomy to geodesic polygons. The correct statement is that the surface is intrinsically flat, with vanishing Riemann curvature tensor, and the result of parallel transport around any loop is $V_{f} = V_{i}$.\n\nHence the most accurate choice is that the final vector equals the initial one because the cylinder is intrinsically flat (vanishing Riemann curvature tensor).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1515232"}, {"introduction": "One of the most profound results in geometry is that curvature leaves a distinct signature on the shapes drawn within a space.
