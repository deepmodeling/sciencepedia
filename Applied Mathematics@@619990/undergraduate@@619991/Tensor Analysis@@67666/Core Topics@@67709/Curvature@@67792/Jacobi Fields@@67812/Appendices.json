The infinitesimal separation between two nearby geodesics can be described by a vector field $J(t)$ called the Jacobi field, where $t$ is a parameter, typically time, along a reference geodesic.

We can verify that this is a unit-speed curve: $|\\gamma'(t)|^2 = \\cos^2 t + (-\\sin t)^2 = 1$.\n\nThe Jacobi equation is $\\nabla_t \\nabla_t J(t) + R(J(t), \\gamma'(t))\\gamma'(t) = 0$.\nThe problem provides the formula for the curvature term on $S^2$:\n$R(J, \\gamma')\\gamma' = \\langle \\gamma', \\gamma' \\rangle J - \\langle J, \\gamma' \\rangle \\gamma'$.\n\nWe are given two conditions for the Jacobi field $J(t)$:\n1.  $J(t)$ is orthogonal to $\\gamma'(t)$, which means $\\langle J(t), \\gamma'(t) \\rangle = 0$ for all $t$.\n2.  $J(t)$ vanishes at $t=0$, so $J(0) = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nLet's use the first condition to simplify the curvature term.

Since $J(t)$ must be orthogonal to $\\gamma'(t)$, we need to find a vector field $E(t)$ that is also tangent to the sphere at $\\gamma(t)$ and orthogonal to $\\gamma'(t)$, so that $\\{E(t)\\}$ forms a basis for the one-dimensional space of vectors orthogonal to $\\gamma'(t)$ in the tangent plane $T_{\\gamma(t)}S^2$.\n\nLet's look for a simple vector field $E(t)$ that satisfies these properties. The tangent space $T_{\\gamma(t)}S^2$ is the plane orthogonal to the position vector $\\gamma(t)$. So, any vector $V$ in $T_{\\gamma(t)}S^2$ must satisfy $\\langle V, \\gamma(t) \\rangle = 0$.\nLet's try the constant vector field $E_0 = (0, 1, 0)$.\nFirst, let's check if it's tangent to the sphere along $\\gamma(t)$:\n$\\langle E_0, \\gamma(t) \\rangle = \\langle (0, 1, 0), (\\sin t, 0, \\cos t) \\rangle = 0$.

Yes, it is.\nFinally, let's make it a unit vector field. $|E_0| = 1$.\nSo, we can choose our basis vector field to be $E(t) = (0, 1, 0)$.\n\nA crucial property of this basis field $E(t)$ is that it is parallel-transported along $\\gamma(t)$. The covariant derivative $\\nabla_t E(t)$ is the projection of the ordinary derivative $E'(t)$ onto the tangent plane $T_{\\gamma(t)}S^2$. Since $E(t)=(0,1,0)$ is a constant vector, its ordinary derivative is $E'(t) = \\mathbf{0}$. The projection of the zero vector is the zero vector, so $\\nabla_t E(t) = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nNow we can write the Jacobi field $J(t)$ in terms of this basis. Since $J(t)$ is in the tangent space and orthogonal to $\\gamma'(t)$, it must be proportional to $E(t)$:\n$J(t) = f(t) E(t)$, for some scalar function $f(t)$.\n\nLet's compute the covariant derivatives of $J(t)$:\n$\\nabla_t J(t) = \\nabla_t (f(t) E(t)) = f'(t) E(t) + f(t) \\nabla_t E(t)$.\nSince $\\nabla_t E(t) = \\mathbf{0}$, this simplifies to $\\nabla_t J(t) = f'(t) E(t)$.\n\nNow for the second covariant derivative:\n$\\nabla_t \\nabla_t J(t) = \\nabla_t (f'(t) E(t)) = f''(t) E(t) + f'(t) \\nabla_t E(t)$.\nAgain, using $\\nabla_t E(t) = \\mathbf{0}$, we get $\\nabla_t \\nabla_t J(t) = f''(t) E(t)$.\n\nSubstitute this into our simplified Jacobi equation $\\nabla_t \\nabla_t J(t) + J(t) = 0$:\n$f''(t) E(t) + f(t) E(t) = 0$\n$(f''(t) + f(t)) E(t) = 0$.\nSince $E(t)$ is a non-zero vector field, the scalar function must be zero:\n$f''(t) + f(t) = 0$.\n\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. Its general solution is:\n$f(t) = C_1 \\cos(t) + C_2 \\sin(t)$, where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are arbitrary constants.\n\nNow we apply the second condition, $J(0) = \\mathbf{0}$.\n$J(0) = f(0) E(0) = (C_1 \\cos(0) + C_2 \\sin(0)) E(0) = (C_1 \\cdot 1 + C_2 \\cdot 0) E(0) = C_1 E(0)$.\nSince $E(0) = (0,1,0)$ is not the zero vector, for $J(0)$ to be the zero vector, we must have $C_1 = 0$.\n\nSo, the function $f(t)$ must be of the form $f(t) = C_2 \\sin(t)$.\nThe general form of the Jacobi field $J(t)$ satisfying the given conditions is therefore:\n$J(t) = f(t) E(t) = C_2 \\sin(t) (0, 1, 0) = (0, C_2 \\sin(t), 0)$.\n\nThe problem asks to denote the arbitrary constant by $C$.
