You will use the Lie derivative to derive the condition for an \"area-preserving\" flow, a key concept in fluid dynamics.

The fundamental equation for the Lie derivative of a differential form is Cartan's magic formula:\n$${\\mathcal L}_X \\omega = d(i_X \\omega) + i_X(d\\omega)$$\nHere, $d$ represents the exterior derivative and $i_X$ represents the interior product with respect to the vector field $X$.\n\nFirst, we compute the term $d\\omega$. The form $\\omega = dx \\wedge dy$ is a 2-form. Its exterior derivative, $d\\omega$, is a 3-form. Since we are in a two-dimensional space, any 3-form is identically zero. Alternatively, we can compute it directly:\n$$d\\omega = d(dx \\wedge dy) = d(dx) \\wedge dy - dx \\wedge d(dy)$$\nSince $dx$ and $dy$ are the differentials of coordinate functions, they are exact 1-forms, and their exterior derivatives are zero: $d(dx) = 0$ and $d(dy) = 0$.\nTherefore,\n$$d\\omega = 0 \\wedge dy - dx \\wedge 0 = 0$$\nWith $d\\omega = 0$, Cartan's formula simplifies significantly to:\n$${\\mathcal L}_X \\omega = d(i_X \\omega)$$\n\nNext, we compute the interior product $i_X \\omega$.
