Let $\\phi_t^X$ be the flow of $X$ and $\\psi_s^Y$ be the flow of $Y$. The condition $[X,Y]=0$ is equivalent to $\\phi_t^X \\circ \\psi_s^Y = \\psi_s^Y \\circ \\phi_t^X$ for all $s,t$ for which the flows are defined.\n\nLet's identify the flows:\n1.  **Flow of $X = x\\,\\partial_x + y\\,\\partial_y$**: The flow lines are solutions to the differential equations $\\frac{dx}{dt} = x$ and $\\frac{dy}{dt} = y$. Given an initial point $(x_0, y_0)$, the solution is $(x(t), y(t)) = (x_0 e^t, y_0 e^t)$. The flow map is $\\phi_t^X(x_0, y_0) = e^t(x_0, y_0)$. This transformation is a uniform scaling or homothety centered at the origin. For $t>0$, it is a dilation, and for $t<0$, it is a contraction. The vector field $X$ is the infinitesimal generator of the one-parameter group of homotheties. The pullback of the metric $g_0 = dx^2+dy^2$ is $(\\phi_t^X)^*g_0 = e^{2t}g_0$, so these are not isometries for $t \\neq 0$.\n\n2.  **Flow of $Y = -y\\,\\partial_x + x\\,\\partial_y$**: The flow lines are solutions to $\\frac{dx}{ds} = -y$ and $\\frac{dy}{ds} = x$. Given an initial point $(x_0,y_0)$, the solution is $(x(s), y(s)) = (x_0 \\cos(s) - y_0 \\sin(s), x_0 \\sin(s) + y_0 \\cos(s))$. In matrix form, this is:\n    $$ \\begin{pmatrix} x(s) \\\\ y(s) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos s & -\\sin s \\\\ \\sin s & \\cos s \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\\\ y_0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The flow map $\\psi_s^Y$ is a rotation about the origin by an angle $s$. Rotations preserve the Euclidean metric $g_0$, so they are isometries of $(\\mathbb{R}^2, g_0)$. The vector field $Y$ is a Killing vector field, generating the special orthogonal group $SO(2)$.\n\nThe result $[X,Y]=0$ means that the action of scaling commutes with the action of rotation. This is intuitively clear: scaling a point and then rotating it yields the same result as rotating it first and then scaling it. In linear algebra terms, a rotation matrix $R_s$ and a scaling matrix $S_t = e^t I$ (where $I$ is the identity matrix) commute:\n$$ S_t R_s = (e^t I) R_s = e^t (I R_s) = e^t R_s $$\n$$ R_s S_t = R_s (e^t I) = e^t (R_s I) = e^t R_s $$\nThus, $S_t R_s = R_s S_t$. This algebraic commutation of the flow maps is the geometric manifestation of the vanishing Lie bracket of their infinitesimal generators. The group of homotheties and the group of rotations on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ (both centered at the origin) are commuting subgroups of the affine group.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2987419"}, {"introduction": "With a solid understanding of the Lie bracket as a \"commutativity detector,\" we can now apply it to solve a deeper geometric problem.
