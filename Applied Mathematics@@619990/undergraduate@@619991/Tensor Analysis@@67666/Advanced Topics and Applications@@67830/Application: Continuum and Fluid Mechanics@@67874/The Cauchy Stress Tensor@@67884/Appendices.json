This practice examines the case of hydrostatic pressure, a state where a material is subjected to uniform compressive stress from all directions, such as in a deep-sea environment. By applying Cauchy's formula, you will investigate whether it's possible for a plane of zero traction to exist within the material, deepening your understanding of how the stress tensor governs internal forces [@problem_id:1544482].", "problem": "A small, solid cubic block of an isotropic material is part of the hull of a deep-sea submersible. At a great depth, the surrounding water exerts a uniform pressure on the block. In continuum mechanics, this state of stress is known as hydrostatic pressure. The Cauchy stress tensor, $\\sigma_{ij}$, describing this state is given by $\\sigma_{ij} = -p\\delta_{ij}$, where $p$ is the magnitude of the pressure (a positive constant) and $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nAn engineer is investigating whether there might exist an internal plane within the material where the material experiences no force. The force per unit area on any internal plane is described by the traction vector, $\\mathbf{t}$. According to Cauchy's stress principle, the components of this vector, $t_i$, for a plane with a unit normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$ (with components $n_j$) are given by the formula $t_i = \\sigma_{ij} n_j$.\n\nCan a plane with zero traction (i.e., $\\mathbf{t} = \\mathbf{0}$) exist within the material under this non-zero hydrostatic pressure?\n\nA.
