In tissues with a high degree of structural organization, such as the white matter tracts in the brain, diffusion is anisotropic (directionally dependent). This directional diffusion is mathematically described by a symmetric, second-rank tensor, $\\mathbf{D}$, called the diffusion tensor. The eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{D}$ represent the diffusivities along three orthogonal principal directions, which are given by the corresponding eigenvectors. In a coordinate system whose axes align with these principal directions (the principal axis system), the matrix representation of the tensor $\\mathbf{D}$ is diagonal.\n\nConsider a simplified model of a coherent bundle of nerve fibers (axons) that are all aligned parallel to the $z$-axis of a Cartesian coordinate system $(x, y, z)$. The diffusion of water molecules is fastest along the direction of the fibers and is equal in all directions perpendicular to the fibers. This results in a diffusion profile shaped like a prolate spheroid. The diffusivity along the main axis of the spheroid (parallel to the fibers) is a constant value denoted by $\\lambda_{\\parallel}$.
