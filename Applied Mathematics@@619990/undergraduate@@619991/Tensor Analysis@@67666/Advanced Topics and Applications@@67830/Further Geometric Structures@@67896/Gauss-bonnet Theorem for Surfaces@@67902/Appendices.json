This first practice applies the theorem to its most classic and intuitive setting: a geodesic triangle on the surface of a sphere. By calculating the sum of the triangle's interior angles, you will directly observe how a surface's constant positive curvature, where $K \\gt 0$, causes geometry to deviate from the flat, Euclidean case where the sum is always $\\pi$ radians [@problem_id:1513158].", "problem": "Consider a perfectly spherical planet of radius $R$. A geodesic triangle is drawn on the surface of this planet. The sides of this triangle are segments of great circles, representing the shortest paths on the surface between the vertices. The area of the region enclosed by this geodesic triangle is exactly one-eighth of the total surface area of the planet. Determine the sum of the interior angles of this geodesic triangle. Express your answer in radians as a multiple of $\\pi$.", "solution": "Let the geodesic triangle be denoted by $T$, and its interior angles be $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2,$ and $\\alpha_3$. We want to find the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\alpha_i$.\n\nThe problem can be solved using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for a region on a surface. For a geodesic triangle $T$ on a smooth surface, the theorem states:\n$$\n\\int_{T} K \\, dA + \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (\\pi - \\alpha_i) = 2\\pi\n$$\nHere, $K$ is the Gaussian curvature of the surface, $dA$ is the surface area element, and $(\\pi - \\alpha_i)$ are the exterior angles at the vertices. Since the sides of the triangle are geodesics, their geodesic curvature is zero, so there is no integral term for the boundary curve.\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for the sum of the interior angles:\n$$\n\\int_{T} K \\, dA + 3\\pi - \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\alpha_i = 2\\pi\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\alpha_i = \\pi + \\int_{T} K \\, dA\n$$\nThis is also known as Girard's theorem for spherical triangles.\n\nFor a sphere of radius $R$, the Gaussian curvature $K$ is constant over the entire surface and is given by the formula $K = \\frac{1}{R^2}$. Since $K$ is a constant, we can take it out of the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{T} K \\, dA = K \\int_{T} dA = K \\cdot \\text{Area}(T)\n$$\nSubstituting $K = \\frac{1}{R^2}$, we get:\n$$\n\\int_{T} K \\, dA = \\frac{1}{R^2} \\cdot \\text{Area}(T)\n$$\nThe problem states that the area of the geodesic triangle, $\\text{Area}(T)$, is one-eighth of the total surface area of the sphere. The total surface area of a sphere of radius $R$ is $A_{\\text{sphere}} = 4\\pi R^2$.\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is:\n$$\n\\text{Area}(T) = \\frac{1}{8} A_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{1}{8} (4\\pi R^2) = \\frac{\\pi R^2}{2}\n$$\nNow we can calculate the value of the integral term:\n$$\n\\int_{T} K \\, dA = \\frac{1}{R^2} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\pi R^2}{2} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\n$$\nNotice that the radius $R$ cancels out, so the result is independent of the size of the sphere.\n\nFinally, we substitute this result back into our expression for the sum of the interior angles:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\alpha_i = \\pi + \\int_{T} K \\, dA = \\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\alpha_i = \\frac{2\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}\n$$\nThe sum of the interior angles of the geodesic triangle is $\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ radians.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3\\pi}{2}}$$", "id": "1513158"}, {"introduction": "How does a concept like Gaussian curvature apply to non-smooth objects like polyhedra, which are common in computer graphics and engineering?
