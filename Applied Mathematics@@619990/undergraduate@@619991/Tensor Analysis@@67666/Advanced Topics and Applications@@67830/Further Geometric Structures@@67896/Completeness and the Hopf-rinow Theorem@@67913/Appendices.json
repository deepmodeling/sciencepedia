The Hopf-Rinow theorem elegantly connects the idea of geodesic completeness (the ability to extend geodesics forever) with metric space completeness (the convergence of Cauchy sequences). This first practice problem uses a familiar object, the open disk, to make these abstract definitions concrete by examining a sequence of points that 'tries' to converge to the missing edge [@problem_id:1494670].", "problem": "Consider a physical system modeled as a 2-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$, where the manifold $M$ is the set of points $(x,y)$ in a plane such that $x^2 + y^2 < R^2$ for some fixed positive radius $R$.

Since $M$ is convex, for any $p,q\\in M$ the straight line segment from $p$ to $q$ lies entirely in $M$.
