Therefore, a coordinate singularity in a particular chart does not constitute a fundamental obstruction to normal coordinates. This rules out option A as the fundamental reason.\n\nSimilarly, the Christoffel symbols for a metric of the form $\\mathrm{diag}(a, r^{2})$ with $a>0$ have the typical nonzero components\n$$\n\\Gamma^{r}_{\\phi\\phi} = -\\frac{r}{a}, \\qquad \\Gamma^{\\phi}_{r\\phi} = \\Gamma^{\\phi}_{\\phi r} = \\frac{1}{r},\n$$\nwhich blow up at $r=0$.

Such divergences are coordinate artifacts and do not preclude the existence of normal coordinates when the surface is smooth at the point. Hence option C is not the fundamental reason.\n\nThe Gaussian curvature of the cone is $0$ away from the apex and is not a smooth function at the apex; in fact, the curvature is concentrated as a defect at the apex. In any case, nonzero Gaussian curvature does not prevent the construction of normal coordinates on smooth surfaces; normal coordinates exist at every point of a smooth Riemannian manifold regardless of curvature.

The rank of the differential drops to $1$ at the apex, and the limit of tangent planes as $r \\to 0$ depends on the direction $\\phi$. There is no unique tangent plane at the apex. In precise terms, the cone is not a smooth surface (not even $C^{1}$) at the apex; the normal vector is discontinuous there, and the surface fails to be an immersed submanifold at that point. Consequently, the tangent space $T_{P}M$ at the apex is not well-defined. Since the exponential map $\\exp_{P}$ requires a well-defined tangent space at $P$, the construction of normal coordinates centered at the apex fails at the most basic level. This is exactly the content of option D.\n\nFinally, option E is irrelevant to the obstruction: the fact that geodesics on an unrolled cone appear as straight lines in a planar sector does not prevent forming a valid coordinate system in general; indeed, on the plane geodesics are straight lines and normal coordinates exist everywhere. The failure at the apex is due to the lack of differentiability and the absence of a unique tangent space, not the linearity of unrolled geodesics.\n\nTherefore, the most fundamental reason is that the apex is a singular, non-differentiable point where the tangent space is not well-defined, which precludes defining the exponential map and hence normal coordinates.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1526929"}]}
