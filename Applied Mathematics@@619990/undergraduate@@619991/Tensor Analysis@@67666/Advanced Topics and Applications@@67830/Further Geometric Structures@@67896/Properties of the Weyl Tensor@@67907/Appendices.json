The Weyl tensor is constructed to have all the same algebraic symmetries as the Riemann tensor, with one additional constraint: it is \"trace-free\". This trace-free condition means that the Ricci-type contraction of the Weyl tensor is zero. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$C^k{}_{ikj} = 0$$\nwhere the repeated index $k$ implies summation from 1 to $n$. The resulting tensor, let's call it $T_{ij} = C^k{}_{ikj}$, is a symmetric tensor of rank two, meaning $T_{ij} = T_{ji}$.
