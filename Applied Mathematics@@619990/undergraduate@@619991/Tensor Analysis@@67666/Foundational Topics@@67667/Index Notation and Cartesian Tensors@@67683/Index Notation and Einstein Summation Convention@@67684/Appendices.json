The convention states that when an index variable appears twice in a single term, summation over all possible values of that index is implied. For example, in a 3-dimensional space where indices run from 1 to 3, the expression for the dot product, $v_i w_i$, is a shorthand for the sum $v_1 w_1 + v_2 w_2 + v_3 w_3$.\n\nConsider an abstract 4-dimensional space where indices, such as $i$ and $j$, can each take on any integer value from 1 to 4. Two rank-2 tensors, $A$ and $B$, are defined in this space, with components denoted by $A_{ij}$ and $B_{ij}$, respectively. An operation involving these tensors is represented by the expression $A_{ij} B_{ij}$.\n\nApplying the Einstein summation convention, determine the total number of individual product terms (e.g., a term like $A_{23}B_{23}$) that are present in the full expansion of the expression $A_{ij} B_{ij}$.

The sum is taken over all possible integer values of the index, which is determined by the dimension of the space.\n\nA fundamental tool in this notation is the Kronecker delta. In a Cartesian coordinate system, its components can be written with either upper or lower indices, and are defined as:\n$$\n\\delta_{ij} = \\delta^{ij} = \\delta^{i}_{j} = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } i = j \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } i \\neq j \\end{cases}\n$$\nConsider a 3-dimensional Euclidean space, where all indices (such as $i$ and $j$) can take on the integer values 1, 2, or 3.\n\nUsing the Einstein summation convention, calculate the numerical value of the scalar quantity $\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{ij}$.", "solution": "The quantity we need to compute is $\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{ij}$. The Einstein summation convention implies that we must sum over both index $i$ and index $j$ because each appears twice in the expression (once as a subscript and once as a superscript, although in this Euclidean context the position does not change the value of the Kronecker delta). Since the space is 3-dimensional, the indices $i$ and $j$ range from 1 to 3.\n\nThe expression $\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{ij}$ is a concise way of writing the double summation:\n$$\n\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{ij} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\delta_{ij} \\delta^{ij}\n$$\nThe problem statement gives the definition of the Kronecker delta, $\\delta_{ij}$, which is 1 if $i=j$ and 0 if $i \\neq j$. The same definition applies to $\\delta^{ij}$. Therefore, the product $\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{ij}$ is non-zero only when the condition $i=j$ is met. If $i \\neq j$, then $\\delta_{ij}=0$, and the term $\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{ij}$ becomes $0 \\cdot \\delta^{ij} = 0$.\n\nConsequently, we only need to sum the terms for which $i=j$:\n$$\n\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{ij} = \\sum_{i=j} \\delta_{ij} \\delta^{ij} = \\delta_{11}\\delta^{11} + \\delta_{22}\\delta^{22} + \\delta_{33}\\delta^{33}\n$$\nAll other terms in the nine-term expansion of the double sum, such as $\\delta_{12}\\delta^{12}$ or $\\delta_{21}\\delta^{21}$, are zero.\n\nAccording to the definition of the Kronecker delta:\n$\\delta_{11} = 1$ and $\\delta^{11} = 1$\n$\\delta_{22} = 1$ and $\\delta^{22} = 1$\n$\\delta_{33} = 1$ and $\\delta^{33} = 1$\n\nSubstituting these values into our sum:\n$$\n\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{ij} = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n$$\nAlternatively, we can perform the summation one index at a time. Let's first sum over $j$:\n$$\n\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{ij} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\delta_{ij} \\delta^{ij} \\right)\n$$\nConsider the inner sum $\\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\delta_{ij} \\delta^{ij}$ for a fixed value of $i$. This sum expands to:\n$$\n\\delta_{i1}\\delta^{i1} + \\delta_{i2}\\delta^{i2} + \\delta_{i3}\\delta^{i3}\n$$\nFor a fixed $i$, only one of the terms $\\delta_{i1}, \\delta_{i2}, \\delta_{i3}$ is non-zero. Specifically, $\\delta_{ij}$ is 1 only when $j=i$. So, the sum simplifies to just the term where $j=i$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\delta_{ij} \\delta^{ij} = \\delta_{ii}\\delta^{ii} = (1)(1) = 1\n$$\nThis result holds for any choice of $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. Now, we substitute this result back into the outer sum over $i$:\n$$\n\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{ij} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n$$\nBoth methods yield the same result.

Throughout this problem, the Einstein summation convention is used, meaning that any index repeated within a single term is summed over all its possible values.\n\nConsider a second-rank contravariant tensor represented by its components $S^{ij}$. This tensor is symmetric, which is defined by the property $S^{ij} = S^{ji}$ for all pairs of indices $(i, j)$.\n\nAlso, consider the Levi-Civita symbol, $\\epsilon_{ijk}$, a third-rank object whose components are defined as follows:\n- $\\epsilon_{ijk} = +1$ for even permutations of $(1,2,3)$ (i.e., $(1,2,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2)$).\n- $\\epsilon_{ijk} = -1$ for odd permutations of $(1,2,3)$ (i.e., $(1,3,2), (3,2,1), (2,1,3)$).\n- $\\epsilon_{ijk} = 0$ if any two indices are equal.\n\nA covector $T_k$ is constructed by contracting these two objects:\n$$T_k = \\epsilon_{ijk} S^{ij}$$\nDetermine the value of the components $T_k$.

The indices $i$ and $j$ are repeated, so according to the Einstein summation convention, they are summed over from 1 to 3. The index $k$ is a free index and can be 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThe defining expression is:\n$$T_k = \\epsilon_{ijk} S^{ij}$$\nIn this expression, the indices $i$ and $j$ are dummy (summation) indices. A fundamental property of expressions involving dummy indices is that they can be relabeled without changing the value of the expression. Let's relabel the dummy indices by swapping them: we will replace every occurrence of $i$ with $j$, and every occurrence of $j$ with $i$.\n$$T_k = \\epsilon_{jik} S^{ji}$$\nNow, we use the given properties of the quantities in the expression.\n1. The tensor $S^{ij}$ is symmetric, which means $S^{ji} = S^{ij}$.\n2. The Levi-Civita symbol $\\epsilon_{ijk}$ is totally antisymmetric. This means that if we swap any two of its indices, the symbol's value is negated. Swapping the first two indices, we have $\\epsilon_{jik} = -\\epsilon_{ijk}$. This property can be verified directly from the definition of the Levi-Civita symbol.\n\nLet's substitute these two properties back into our relabeled expression for $T_k$:\n$$T_k = (-\\epsilon_{ijk}) (S^{ij})$$\nWe can move the minus sign to the front:\n$$T_k = - \\epsilon_{ijk} S^{ij}$$\nNow, notice that the expression on the right-hand side, $\\epsilon_{ijk} S^{ij}$, is the original definition of $T_k$. Therefore, we have derived the relationship:\n$$T_k = -T_k$$\nThis equation must hold for each component of $T_k$. The only number that is equal to its own negative is zero. We can show this algebraically by adding $T_k$ to both sides of the equation:\n$$T_k + T_k = 0$$\n$$2T_k = 0$$\n$$T_k = 0$$\nSince this derivation did not depend on the specific value of the free index $k$, it holds true for $k=1, 2, 3$. Thus, all components of the covector $T_k$ are zero.\n\nAs a check, we can also expand the sum for a specific component, say $k=3$. The summation is over $i$ and $j$ from 1 to 3. The only non-zero components of $\\epsilon_{ij3}$ are when $i, j$ are a permutation of $1, 2$.\n$$T_3 = \\sum_{i,j=1}^3 \\epsilon_{ij3} S^{ij} = \\epsilon_{123}S^{12} + \\epsilon_{213}S^{21}$$\nAll other terms in the sum are zero because at least two indices on $\\epsilon_{ij3}$ will be equal. From the definition of the Levi-Civita symbol, $\\epsilon_{123} = +1$ and $\\epsilon_{213} = -1$.\n$$T_3 = (1) S^{12} + (-1) S^{21} = S^{12} - S^{21}$$\nSince the tensor $S^{ij}$ is symmetric, we have $S^{12} = S^{21}$. Substituting this into the expression for $T_3$:\n$$T_3 = S^{12} - S^{12} = 0$$\nA similar explicit calculation for $k=1$ and $k=2$ would also show that $T_1=0$ and $T_2=0$. The index manipulation method is more general and powerful as it avoids writing out the sums.
