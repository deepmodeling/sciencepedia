Thus the hypothesis provides no constraints on $A_{i3}$, $A_{3j}$, or $A_{33}$, nor on how these components would have to transform under rotations.\n\nThis shows that one can construct objects that agree on $U$ with a genuine tensor (hence yield an invariant $S$ for all $v,w\\in U$), but differ arbitrarily in components involving the $x^{3}$-direction, thereby failing to be a tensor in the full $3$-dimensional space. For example, fix in some Cartesian frame $A_{ab}=\\delta_{ab}$ for $a,b\\in\\{1,2\\}$, while choosing $A_{13},A_{31},A_{23},A_{32},A_{33}$ arbitrarily (or with a non-tensorial transformation rule).
