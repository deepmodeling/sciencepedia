In her system, the particle $P$ is located at coordinates $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$. Instead of using the standard position vector, she proposes to describe the particle's location using a triplet of numbers, $V_A$, defined by the perpendicular distances from $P$ to the three coordinate planes. Specifically, $V_A = (d_{yz}, d_{xz}, d_{xy})$, where $d_{yz}$ is the perpendicular distance from $P$ to the $y-z$ plane, $d_{xz}$ is the distance to the $x-z$ plane, and $d_{xy}$ is the distance to the $x-y$ plane.\n\nBoris uses a different right-handed Cartesian coordinate system $S'$ with basis vectors $(\\hat{\\imath}', \\hat{\\jmath}', \\hat{k}')$ along axes $(x', y', z')$. Boris's system $S'$ is obtained by rotating Alba's system $S$ by an angle $\\theta$ counter-clockwise about their common $z$-axis (so $\\hat{k}' = \\hat{k}$). Boris measures the coordinates of the same particle $P$ as $(x'_0, y'_0, z'_0)$ in his system.
