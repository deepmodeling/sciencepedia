Consider a simplified theoretical model where a particular physical property is described by a constitutive tensor of type $(2, 3)$. This tensor defines a multilinear relationship that takes two contravariant vectors and three covariant vectors as input and produces a scalar value. The underlying physical space of our model is a 2-dimensional real vector space, denoted by $V$. The set of all possible tensors of type $(2, 3)$ on this space $V$ itself forms a vector space. What is the dimension of this space of $(2, 3)$-tensors?", "solution": "A tensor of type $(p,q)$ over a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ is an element of $V^{\\otimes p} \\otimes (V^{*})^{\\otimes q}$.
