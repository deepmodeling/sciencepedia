[@problem_id:2068923]", "problem": "In the study of classical mechanics on a two-dimensional plane, it is often useful to switch between different Cartesian coordinate systems. Consider a transformation from an initial coordinate system $(x,y)$ to a new coordinate system $(x',y')$. This transformation is described by a set of linear equations that relate the new coordinates to the old ones:\n$x' = c x + c y$\n$y' = -c x + c y$\nwhere $c$ is a real, positive constant.\nFor this transformation to represent a pure, rigid rotation of the coordinate system, without any scaling (stretching/shrinking) or reflection, the underlying transformation matrix must satisfy specific mathematical properties. Determine the precise numerical value of the constant $c$ that ensures this transformation is a pure rotation.", "solution": "The relationship between the new coordinates $(x', y')$ and the old coordinates $(x, y)$ can be expressed in matrix form. Let the position vector in the original system be $\\mathbf{r} = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}$ and in the new system be $\\mathbf{r}' = \\begin{pmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\end{pmatrix}$. The transformation is given by the matrix equation $\\mathbf{r}' = A \\mathbf{r}$, where $A$ is the transformation matrix.\n\nFrom the given linear equations:\n$x' = c x + c y$\n$y' = -c x + c y$\n\nWe can write down the transformation matrix $A$ as:\n$$A = \\begin{pmatrix} c & c \\\\ -c & c \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nFor the transformation to represent a \"pure, rigid rotation\", the matrix $A$ must be a proper rotation matrix. This implies two conditions must be met:\n1.  The matrix must be orthogonal, meaning it preserves lengths and angles. This corresponds to the \"rigid\" and \"no scaling\" requirement. Mathematically, an orthogonal matrix satisfies the condition $A^T A = I$, where $A^T$ is the transpose of $A$ and $I$ is the identity matrix.\n2.  The matrix must have a determinant of +1. This ensures the orientation of the coordinate system is preserved, which corresponds to the \"no reflection\" requirement. Mathematically, $\\det(A) = 1$.\n\nWe will now apply these two conditions to the matrix $A$.\n\nFirst, let's impose the orthogonality condition, $A^T A = I$. The transpose of matrix $A$ is:\n$$A^T = \\begin{pmatrix} c & -c \\\\ c & c \\end{pmatrix}$$\nNow, we compute the product $A^T A$:\n$$A^T A = \\begin{pmatrix} c & -c \\\\ c & c \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c & c \\\\ -c & c \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (c)(c) + (-c)(-c) & (c)(c) + (-c)(c) \\\\ (c)(c) + (c)(-c) & (c)(c) + (c)(c) \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$A^T A = \\begin{pmatrix} c^2 + c^2 & c^2 - c^2 \\\\ c^2 - c^2 & c^2 + c^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2c^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2c^2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nFor this matrix to be equal to the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix $I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, the diagonal elements must be equal to 1. This gives us the equation:\n$$2c^2 = 1$$\n\nNext, let's impose the determinant condition, $\\det(A) = 1$. The determinant of matrix $A$ is:\n$$\\det(A) = (c)(c) - (c)(-c) = c^2 + c^2 = 2c^2$$\nSetting the determinant equal to 1 gives us the equation:\n$$2c^2 = 1$$\n\nBoth conditions independently lead to the same equation for $c$. We solve this equation for $c$:\n$$c^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$c = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nThe problem statement specifies that $c$ must be a positive constant.
