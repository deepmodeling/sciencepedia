By using a simple $2 \\times 2$ matrix representation, this exercise allows you to directly compute the product of two group elements and then use the principles of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula to find the single equivalent generator. This practice provides a tangible foundation for understanding how successive transformations are composed within a Lie group framework.

A basis for this algebra can be chosen as the generator of dilations, $D$, and the generator of translations, $P$.

For instance, a pure dilation by a factor $e^a$ corresponds to the group element $e^{aD}$, and a pure translation by $b$ corresponds to $e^{bP}$.\n\nAccording to the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula, the product of two such group elements can be written as the exponential of a single element from the Lie algebra, i.e., $e^{aD} e^{bP} = e^Z$ for some $Z \\in \\mathfrak{aff}(1, \\mathbb{R})$.\n\nGiven the matrix representations for $D$ and $P$, and non-zero real parameters $a$ and $b$, derive the expression for the generator $Z$ as a linear combination of $D$ and $P$.", "solution": "To find the generator $Z$ such that $e^Z = e^{aD}e^{bP}$, we first compute the product of the two matrix exponentials on the left-hand side, then compute the general form of the matrix exponential on the right-hand side, and finally equate them to solve for the coefficients of $Z$.\n\n1.  **Compute the Left-Hand Side (LHS):**\n    First, we compute the individual matrix exponentials for the generators $D=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $P=\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    For the dilation generator $D$, we have $D^k = D$ for any integer $k \\ge 1$.

Thus, the series for the exponential truncates:\n    $$e^{bP} = I + bP = \\begin{pmatrix}1&b\\\\0&1\\end{pmatrix}$$\n    The product is then:\n    $$e^{aD}e^{bP} = \\begin{pmatrix}e^a&0\\\\0&1\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}1&b\\\\0&1\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}e^a&e^ab\\\\0&1\\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n2.  **Compute the Right-Hand Side (RHS):**\n    We need to compute $e^Z$ for a general element $Z = xD + yP = \\begin{pmatrix} x & y \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ from the algebra. The exponential of this upper-triangular matrix is a standard result:\n    $$e^Z = \\begin{pmatrix} e^x & y\\frac{e^x-1}{x} \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n3.  **Equate LHS and RHS and Solve:**\n    By equating the matrices from step 1 and step 2, we get:\n    $$\\begin{pmatrix} e^x & y\\frac{e^x-1}{x} \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}e^a&e^ab\\\\0&1\\end{pmatrix}$$\n    Comparing the matrix elements:\n    -   From the (1,1) element: $e^x = e^a \\implies x=a$.\n    -   From the (1,2) element: $y\\frac{e^x-1}{x} = e^ab$. Substituting $x=a$, we get $y\\frac{e^a-1}{a} = e^ab$.\n    -   Solving for $y$: $y = \\frac{a e^a b}{e^a - 1} = \\frac{ab}{e^{-a}(e^a - 1)} = \\frac{ab}{1 - e^{-a}}$.\n\n4.  **Final Result:**\n    The resulting generator is $Z = xD + yP$, so:\n    $$Z = aD + \\frac{ab}{1-e^{-a}}P$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{aD+\\frac{ab}{1-e^{-a}}P}$$", "id": "622998"}, {"introduction": "Next, we turn our attention to the Heisenberg algebra, a cornerstone in quantum mechanics and signal processing.
