Key representation-theoretic facts used:\n- The number of non-isomorphic irreducible representations of a finite group equals the number of its conjugacy classes.\n- The regular representation decomposes as a direct sum of irreducibles with multiplicities equal to their dimensions, and the sum of squares of the dimensions of the irreducibles equals the group order.\n- The number of one-dimensional irreducible representations equals the order of the abelianization of the group.\n\nFirst, determine the number of irreducible representations.\n- For $D_8$ (symmetries of a square, order $8$): its conjugacy classes are $\\{1\\}$, $\\{r^2\\}$, $\\{r,r^3\\}$, and the two classes of reflections (each of size $2$). This gives $5$ conjugacy classes, hence $5$ irreducible representations.\n- For $Q_8$ (order $8$): its conjugacy classes are $\\{1\\}$, $\\{-1\\}$, $\\{i,-i\\}$, $\\{j,-j\\}$, $\\{k,-k\\}$, again $5$ classes, hence $5$ irreducible representations.\n\nNext, determine the multiset of dimensions.
