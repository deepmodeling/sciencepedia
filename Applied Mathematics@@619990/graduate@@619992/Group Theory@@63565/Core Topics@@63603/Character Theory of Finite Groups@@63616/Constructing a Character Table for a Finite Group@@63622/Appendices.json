This exercise uses the group $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, a small abelian group isomorphic to the Klein four-group $C_2 \\times C_2$. By working through this problem, you will gain first-hand experience with the fundamental properties of characters for abelian groups, where every irreducible representation is one-dimensional, providing a clear and manageable entry point into the mechanics of character table construction.

Present your answer as a $4 \\times 4$ matrix where the entry in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column is the value of the $i$-th irreducible character on the $j$-th element.\n\nFor the purpose of a uniquely specified answer, you must adhere to the following ordering conventions:\n1.  Order the columns of the table corresponding to the group elements in the sequence $[1], [3], [5], [7]$. Since $G$ is an abelian group, each element forms its own conjugacy class.\n2.  Order the rows of the table, which correspond to the irreducible characters, in the following manner: The first row must be the trivial character.

Compute the orders of the nonidentity elements:\n$$[3]^{2} = [9] = [1], \\quad [5]^{2} = [25] = [1], \\quad [7]^{2} = [49] = [1].$$\nThus every nonidentity element has order $2$, so $G \\cong C_{2} \\times C_{2}$.\n\nSince $G$ is abelian, all irreducible characters are $1$-dimensional, and there are $|G|=4$ of them. Each irreducible character is a homomorphism $G \\to \\mathbb{C}^{\\times}$ whose values on elements of order $2$ must lie in $\\{\\pm 1\\}$.
