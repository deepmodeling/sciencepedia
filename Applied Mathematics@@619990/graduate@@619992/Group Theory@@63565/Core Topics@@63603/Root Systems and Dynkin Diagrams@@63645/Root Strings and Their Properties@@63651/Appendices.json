Let's denote the set of all such roots as $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the inner products between the simple roots using the given Cartan matrix $A$ and the ratios of their squared lengths. The formula is $A_{ij} = \\frac{2(\\alpha_i, \\alpha_j)}{(\\alpha_j, \\alpha_j)}$.\nWe are given $(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_1)=2$, $(\\alpha_2, \\alpha_2)=2$, and $(\\alpha_3, \\alpha_3)=1$.\n\n-   $(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2)$: From $A_{12} = -1$, we have $\\frac{2(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2)}{(\\alpha_2, \\alpha_2)} = -1$.

Let the roots in this string be of the form $\\alpha_1 + k\\alpha_2$, where $k$ is an integer ranging from $-p$ to $q$.\nWe use the formula $p-q = \\frac{2(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2)}{(\\alpha_2, \\alpha_2)}$.\n$$\np-q = \\frac{2(-1)}{2} = -1\n$$\nTo find $p$ and $q$, we need to check if $\\alpha_1 - \\alpha_2$ is a root. Since $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ are simple roots, their difference $\\alpha_1 - \\alpha_2$ has coefficients $(1, -1, 0)$ in the simple root basis. Since the coefficients are of mixed sign, $\\alpha_1 - \\alpha_2$ is not a root. This means the string cannot be extended in the negative $\\alpha_2$ direction, so $p=0$.\nSubstituting $p=0$ into $p-q=-1$, we get $0-q = -1$, which gives $q=1$.\nSo, the integer $k$ can take values $0, 1$. The roots in the primary string, which we denote by $\\mathcal{P}$, are:\n-   For $k=0$: $\\gamma_1 = \\alpha_1 + 0\\alpha_2 = \\alpha_1$\n-   For $k=1$: $\\gamma_2 = \\alpha_1 + 1\\alpha_2 = \\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2$\nThus, the primary string is the set $\\mathcal{P} = \\{\\alpha_1, \\alpha_1+\\alpha_2\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the roots in the secondary strings.**\nFor each root $\\gamma \\in \\mathcal{P}$, we form a secondary string, which is the $\\alpha_3$-string through $\\gamma$.\n\n**Case 1: Secondary string through $\\gamma_1 = \\alpha_1$.**\nLet the roots be $\\alpha_1 + m\\alpha_3$ for $m \\in [-p_1, q_1]$.\n$$\np_1 - q_1 = \\frac{2(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_3)}{(\\alpha_3, \\alpha_3)} = \\frac{2(0)}{1} = 0\n$$\nSo, $p_1 = q_1$. The difference $\\alpha_1 - \\alpha_3$ has mixed-sign coefficients $(1, 0, -1)$ and is not a root. Thus, $p_1=0$.\nThis implies $q_1=0$. The only allowed value for $m$ is $0$.\nThe first secondary string, $\\mathcal{S}_1$, consists of a single root:\n$\\mathcal{S}_1 = \\{\\alpha_1\\}$.\n\n**Case 2: Secondary string through $\\gamma_2 = \\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2$.**\nLet the roots be $(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2) + m\\alpha_3$ for $m \\in [-p_2, q_2]$.\nFirst, calculate the inner product: $(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3) = (\\alpha_1, \\alpha_3) + (\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3) = 0 + (-1) = -1$.\n$$\np_2 - q_2 = \\frac{2(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3)}{(\\alpha_3, \\alpha_3)} = \\frac{2(-1)}{1} = -2\n$$\nThe vector $(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2) - \\alpha_3$ has coefficients $(1, 1, -1)$ in the simple root basis. Since the signs are mixed, it is not a root. Therefore, $p_2=0$.\nSubstituting $p_2=0$ into $p_2 - q_2 = -2$, we get $0 - q_2 = -2$, which gives $q_2=2$.\nThe integer $m$ can take values $0, 1, 2$.
