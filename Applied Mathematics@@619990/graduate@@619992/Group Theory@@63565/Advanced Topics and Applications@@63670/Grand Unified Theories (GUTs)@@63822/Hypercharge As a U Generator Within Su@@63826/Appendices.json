The electroweak hypercharge generator, $Y$, corresponds to the generator of the $U(1)_Y$ subgroup. For $Y$ to be part of the $SU(5)$ Lie algebra and also a generator for a $U(1)$ subgroup that commutes with $SU(3)_C \\times SU(2)_L$, it must take the general diagonal form:\n$$\nY = \\begin{pmatrix}\nc_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{I}_3 & \\mathbf{0}_{3\\times2} \\\\\n\\mathbf{0}_{2\\times3} & c_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{I}_2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{I}_n$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix, $\\mathbf{0}_{m\\times n}$ is the $m \\times n$ zero matrix, and $c_1, c_2$ are real constants.\n\nThe first generation of Standard Model fermions is placed into two irreducible representations of $SU(5)$, the $\\bar{\\mathbf{5}}$ (anti-fundamental) and the $\\mathbf{10}$. The $\\bar{\\mathbf{5}}$ representation contains the color-antitriplet of down-type antiquarks ($\\bar{d}$) and the weak isospin doublet of left-handed leptons ($L$). These particles correspond to the basis vectors upon which the $5 \\times 5$ representation matrices act.

The conventional normalization of hypercharge dictates that the lepton doublet, $L = (\\nu_e, e^-)_L$, has a weak hypercharge of $Y_L = -1$.\n\nUsing the tracelessness condition for an $SU(5)$ generator and the given hypercharge for the lepton doublet to fix the constants $c_1$ and $c_2$, derive the numerical value of the trace invariant $\\text{Tr}(Y^2)$ for the $\\bar{\\mathbf{5}}$ representation.\n\n", "solution": "The problem asks for the calculation of $\\text{Tr}(Y^2)$ for the hypercharge generator $Y$ acting on the anti-fundamental ($\\bar{\\mathbf{5}}$) representation of $SU(5)$.\n\nFirst, we establish the structure of the hypercharge generator $Y$. As given, it must commute with the block-diagonal $SU(3)_C$ and $SU(2)_L$ subgroups, so it takes the form:\n$$\nY = \\text{diag}(c_1, c_1, c_1, c_2, c_2)\n$$\nwhere the first three diagonal entries correspond to the color-antitriplet states and the last two correspond to the weak-isospin doublet states.\n\nSecond, the generator $Y$ must belong to the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{su}(5)$, which means it must be a traceless matrix. We apply the trace condition $\\text{Tr}(Y) = 0$:\n$$\n\\text{Tr}(Y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} Y_{ii} = 3c_1 + 2c_2 = 0\n$$\nThis gives a relationship between the constants $c_1$ and $c_2$:\n$$\nc_2 = -\\frac{3}{2} c_1\n$$\n\nThird, we use the provided physical information to fix the normalization of the generator. The problem states that the weak doublet of left-handed leptons ($L$) has a hypercharge $Y_L = -1$. The components of the state vector corresponding to this doublet are acted upon by the lower $2 \\times 2$ block of the $Y$ matrix. The eigenvalue of $Y$ for these states is $c_2$. Therefore, we have:\n$$\nc_2 = Y_L = -1\n$$\n\nNow we can solve for the constant $c_1$ using the relation derived from the tracelessness condition:\n$$\n-1 = -\\frac{3}{2} c_1\n$$\n$$\nc_1 = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\n\nWith both constants determined, we can write down the explicit matrix for the hypercharge generator $Y$ in the $\\bar{\\mathbf{5}}$ representation:\n$$\nY = \\text{diag}\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{2}{3}, -1, -1\\right)\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are indeed the hypercharges of the particles in the representation: $Y_{\\bar{d}} = 2/3$ and $Y_L = -1$.\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the trace invariant $\\text{Tr}(Y^2)$.
