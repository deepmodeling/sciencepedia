In this framework, the fundamental particles and any new hypothetical particles must belong to irreducible representations (irreps) of $SO(10)$. When the GUT symmetry is broken down to the SM symmetry, these $SO(10)$ irreps decompose, or \"branch,\" into a direct sum of SM irreps.\n\nAn SM irrep is denoted by $(\\mathbf{d_C}, \\mathbf{d_L})_Y$, where $\\mathbf{d_C}$ is the dimension of the $SU(3)_C$ (color) representation, $\\mathbf{d_L}$ is the dimension of the $SU(2)_L$ (weak isospin) representation, and $Y$ is the weak hypercharge.\n\nConsider a hypothetical particle that is a color octet, meaning it transforms in the 8-dimensional adjoint representation of $SU(3)_C$.
