Composite particles, such as baryons made of three quarks, are described by states within the tensor product of the constituent quark representations. This tensor product space can be decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible representations (irreps) of SU(N).\n\nOne of these irreps is formed by the totally symmetric combinations of the quark states. Mathematically, this corresponds to the space of rank-$k$ totally symmetric tensors, $S_{i_1 i_2 \\dots i_k}$, where each index $i_j$ ranges from $1$ to $N$. A tensor is totally symmetric if its components are invariant under any permutation of its indices. The dimension of this irrep is equal to the number of linearly independent components of such a tensor.\n\nFirst, by using a combinatorial argument, derive a general formula for the dimension of the totally symmetric irrep obtained from the tensor product of $k$ fundamental representations of SU(N).\n\nThen, apply this formula to a specific physical system. In a model extending the standard three-quark (up, down, strange) flavor symmetry to include the charm quark, the relevant flavor group is SU(4). Baryons in this model are composite particles made of three quarks. Determine the dimension of the totally symmetric irrep arising from the tensor product of three fundamental representations of SU(4).
