This algebraic property implies that the eigenvalues of $\\hat{P}$ are restricted to be $\\pm 1$.\n\nThe action of $\\hat{P}$ on a quantum state can be analyzed by considering its constituent parts. For a system of particles, the total parity is a multiplicative quantum number. Consider a composite system of two distinct particles, A and B.
