Symmetries of the Dynkin diagram are called diagram automorphisms. These automorphisms induce outer automorphisms of the Lie algebra.\n\nThe simple Lie algebra $A_n$, corresponding to $\\mathfrak{sl}(n+1, \\mathbb{C})$, has rank $n$. Its Dynkin diagram is a linear chain of $n$ nodes, representing the $n$ simple roots $\\{\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_n\\}$. The Cartan matrix $C$ for $A_n$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix whose entries are given by the formula $C_{ij} = \\frac{2 \\langle \\alpha_i, \\alpha_j \\rangle}{\\langle \\alpha_j, \\alpha_j \\rangle}$.
