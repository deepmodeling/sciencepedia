The algorithm proceeds by inserting the elements of the permutation, $w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_n$, one by one into an initially empty tableau. The procedure for inserting a number $x$ into a partially-filled tableau is as follows:\n1.  Begin with the first row. In the current row, find the smallest entry that is strictly greater than $x$.\n2.  If such an entry exists, say $y$, replace $y$ with $x$ in the current row.

This shape $\\lambda$ provides a bridge between a specific permutation and a specific irrep.\n\nThe RS correspondence is constructed via an insertion algorithm. Given a permutation $w = w_1 w_2 \\dots w_n$, one constructs the \"insertion tableau\" $P$ and the \"recording tableau\" $Q$ step-by-step.

To insert an integer $x$ into a row of the tableau, find the smallest entry in that row which is strictly greater than $x$.\n2.  If such an entry exists, replace it with $x$.
