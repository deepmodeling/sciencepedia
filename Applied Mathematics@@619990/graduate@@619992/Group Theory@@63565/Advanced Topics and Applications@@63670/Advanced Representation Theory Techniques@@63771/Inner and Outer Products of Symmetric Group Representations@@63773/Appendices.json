The character $\\chi_\\lambda$ of an irrep $V_\\lambda$ is the function $\\chi_\\lambda(g) = \\text{Tr}(\\rho_\\lambda(g))$, where $\\rho_\\lambda$ is a matrix representation of $G$ corresponding to $V_\\lambda$. Characters are constant on conjugacy classes.\n\nThe tensor product (also known as Kronecker product) of two representations $V_\\lambda$ and $V_\\mu$ results in a new representation $V_\\lambda \\otimes V_\\mu$. Its character is the product of the individual characters: $\\chi_{\\lambda \\otimes \\mu}(g) = \\chi_\\lambda(g) \\chi_\\mu(g)$.

The characters of $S_n$ are always real-valued. The one-dimensional irrep corresponding to the partition $[1^n]$ is the sign representation, denoted $\\epsilon$.
