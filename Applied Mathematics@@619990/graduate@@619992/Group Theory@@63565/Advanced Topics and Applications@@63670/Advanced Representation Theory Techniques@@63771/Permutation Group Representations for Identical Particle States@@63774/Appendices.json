This first practice explores a concrete example: a system of two identical deuterons. By enforcing the requirement that the total wavefunction be symmetric, you will derive a condition that connects the spatial and spin degrees of freedom, ultimately determining the allowed values for the system's total spin $S$ [@problem_id:739788].", "problem": "Consider a system composed of two identical deuterons. A deuteron is a composite particle with a nuclear spin quantum number $I=1$ and is a boson. The total wavefunction of the system, $\\Psi_{\\text{total}}$, can be expressed as a product of a spatial part and a spin part: $\\Psi_{\\text{total}} = \\psi_{\\text{spatial}} \\otimes \\chi_{\\text{spin}}$.\n\nFor a system of identical bosons, the total wavefunction must be symmetric under the exchange of any two particles. The symmetry of the spatial part of the wavefunction, $\\psi_{\\text{spatial}}$, under particle exchange is determined by the relative orbital angular momentum quantum number, $L$. The eigenvalue of the particle exchange operator acting on the spatial wavefunction is $(-1)^L$.\n\nThe two individual deuteron spins, $\\vec{I}_1$ and $\\vec{I}_2$, combine to form a total spin $\\vec{S} = \\vec{I}_1 + \\vec{I}_2$. The total spin quantum number, $S$, can take several values. The symmetry of the spin wavefunction, $\\chi_{\\text{spin}}$, for a state with a given total spin $S$ is given by the eigenvalue $(-1)^{2I-S}$ under spin exchange.\n\nThe two-deuteron system is prepared in a state with a definite relative orbital angular momentum quantum number $L=1$. Due to the symmetrization requirement, only certain values of the total spin quantum number $S$ are physically allowed. Let $\\mathcal{S}$ be the set of all allowed values for $S$.\n\nYour task is to derive the total number of allowed spin substates for this system, which is given by the quantity $\\mathcal{N} = \\sum_{S \\in \\mathcal{S}} (2S+1)$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total number of allowed spin substates for a system of two identical deuterons with relative orbital angular momentum $L=1$.\n\n1.  **Symmetry of the Total Wavefunction**:\n    Since deuterons are bosons, the total wavefunction $\\Psi_{\\text{total}}$ must be symmetric under the exchange of the two particles. Let $P_{12}$ be the particle exchange operator. The symmetry condition is:\n    $$P_{12} \\Psi_{\\text{total}} = (+1) \\Psi_{\\text{total}}$$\n\n2.  **Symmetry of Spatial and Spin Parts**:\n    The total wavefunction is the product of the spatial and spin parts, $\\Psi_{\\text{total}} = \\psi_{\\text{spatial}} \\otimes \\chi_{\\text{spin}}$. The exchange operator acts on both parts, so its eigenvalue for the total wavefunction is the product of its eigenvalues for the spatial and spin parts.\n    $$(\\text{Symmetry of } \\Psi_{\\text{total}}) = (\\text{Symmetry of } \\psi_{\\text{spatial}}) \\times (\\text{Symmetry of } \\chi_{\\text{spin}})$$\n\n3.  **Applying the Given Symmetries**:\n    The problem states that the symmetry of the spatial part is $(-1)^L$ and the symmetry of the spin part is $(-1)^{2I-S}$. Substituting these into the symmetry equation, we get:\n    $$+1 = (-1)^L \\times (-1)^{2I-S}$$\n\n4.  **Substituting System-Specific Parameters**:\n    The system consists of two deuterons, which have spin $I=1$. The system is in a state with orbital angular momentum $L=1$. Plugging these values into the condition:\n    $$1 = (-1)^1 \\times (-1)^{2(1)-S}$$\n    $$1 = (-1) \\times (-1)^{2-S}$$\n    $$1 = (-1)^{1 + (2-S)}$$\n    $$1 = (-1)^{3-S}$$\n\n5.  **Determining the Condition on S**:\n    For $(-1)^{3-S}$ to be equal to $+1$, the exponent $(3-S)$ must be an even integer. If $S$ is an integer, this is equivalent to requiring $S$ to be an odd integer.\n\n6.  **Finding Possible Values of Total Spin S**:\n    The total spin quantum number $S$ is obtained by coupling two individual spins with $I=1$. The possible values of $S$ range from $|I-I|$ to $I+I$ in integer steps:\n    $$S \\in \\{|1-1|, \\dots, 1+1\\} = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$$\n\n7.  **Identifying Allowed Values of S**:\n    We must now select the values from the set $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$ that satisfy the condition derived from the symmetry requirement, which is that $S$ must be an odd integer.\n    -   For $S=0$: $S$ is even. Not allowed.\n    -   For $S=1$: $S$ is odd. Allowed.\n    -   For $S=2$: $S$ is even. Not allowed.\n    Therefore, the only allowed value for the total spin quantum number is $S=1$. The set of allowed values is $\\mathcal{S} = \\{1\\}$.\n\n8.  **Calculating the Total Number of Allowed Spin Substates**:\n    The final step is to calculate the quantity $\\mathcal{N}$, which is the sum of the degeneracies $(2S+1)$ for all allowed values of $S$.\n    $$\\mathcal{N} = \\sum_{S \\in \\mathcal{S}} (2S+1)$$\n    Since $\\mathcal{S}=\\{1\\}$, the sum has only one term:\n    $$\\mathcal{N} = 2(1) + 1$$\n    $$\\mathcal{N} = 3$$\n    This means that for a system of two deuterons with relative orbital angular momentum $L=1$, the total spin must be $S=1$, and there are $2S+1=3$ possible spin substates, corresponding to $M_S = -1, 0, 1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3}\n$$", "id": "739788"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basic symmetrization principle, a central task in quantum statistics is to enumerate the total number of available states for a system of identical particles.
