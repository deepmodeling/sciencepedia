So $L_1L_{-1} = L_{-1}L_1 + 2L_0$.\n$G_{12} = 3\\langle h|(L_{-1}L_1 + 2L_0)|h\\rangle = 3( \\langle h|L_{-1}L_1|h\\rangle + 2\\langle h|L_0|h\\rangle)$.\nThe first term is zero.

Since $h$ is a real parameter, $G_{21} = G_{12} = 6h$.\nAlternatively, we can compute it directly:\n$G_{21} = \\langle h|L_1 L_1 L_{-2} |h\\rangle$. From $[L_1, L_{-2}] = 3L_{-1}$, we have $L_1L_{-2} = L_{-2}L_1 + 3L_{-1}$.\n$G_{21} = \\langle h|L_1 (L_{-2}L_1 + 3L_{-1}) |h\\rangle = \\langle h|(L_1L_{-2}L_1 + 3L_1L_{-1})|h\\rangle$.\nThe first term is zero because $L_1|h\\rangle=0$. The second term is $3\\langle h|L_1L_{-1}|h\\rangle = 3(2h) = 6h$. This confirms $G_{21}=6h$.\n\n**4. Calculation of $G_{22}$:**\n$G_{22} = \\langle h|L_1^2 L_{-1}^2|h\\rangle = \\langle h|L_1L_1L_{-1}L_{-1}|h\\rangle$.\nWe commute the $L_1$ operators to the right.\n$G_{22} = \\langle h|L_1(L_{-1}L_1+2L_0)L_{-1}|h\\rangle = \\langle h|(L_1L_{-1}L_1L_{-1} + 2L_1L_0L_{-1})|h\\rangle$.\nLet's evaluate each term:\n- First term: $\\langle h|L_1L_{-1}L_1L_{-1}|h\\rangle$. We evaluate from the right: $L_1L_{-1}|h\\rangle = (L_{-1}L_1+2L_0)|h\\rangle = 2h|h\\rangle$. So the expression becomes $\\langle h|L_1L_{-1}(2h|h\\rangle) = 2h\\langle h|L_1L_{-1}|h\\rangle = 2h(2h) = 4h^2$.\n- Second term: $2\\langle h|L_1L_0L_{-1}|h\\rangle$. The state $L_{-1}|h\\rangle$ is a level-1 state, so $L_0 L_{-1}|h\\rangle = (h+1)L_{-1}|h\\rangle$. The expression becomes $2\\langle h|L_1 (h+1)L_{-1}|h\\rangle = 2(h+1)\\langle h|L_1L_{-1}|h\\rangle = 2(h+1)(2h) = 4h(h+1)$.\nSo, $G_{22} = 4h^2 + 4h(h+1) = 4h^2 + 4h^2 + 4h = 8h^2+4h$.\n\n**5.
