This order parameter transforms according to one of the irreducible representations (irreps) of the point group of the high-symmetry phase, $G_0$.\n\nA ferroelectric phase transition is a specific type of structural transition where the crystal develops a spontaneous electric polarization, $\\vec{P}$, below a critical temperature. This occurs when the order parameter itself transforms as a polar vector, or has a component that does. The group-theoretical criterion for a transition from a centrosymmetric high-symmetry phase to a ferroelectric phase to be possible is that the irrep, $\\Gamma_i$, which drives the transition, must be one of the irreps that span the representation of the polar vector, $\\Gamma_V$. In simpler terms, $\\Gamma_i$ must have a basis function that transforms as $x$, $y$, or $z$.\n\n**Problem Statement**\nConsider a crystal whose high-temperature paraelectric phase has the symmetry of the point group $D_{2h}$.
