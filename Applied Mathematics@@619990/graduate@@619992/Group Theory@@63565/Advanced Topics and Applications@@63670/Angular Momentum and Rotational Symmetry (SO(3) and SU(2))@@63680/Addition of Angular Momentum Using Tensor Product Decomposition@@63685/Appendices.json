The dimension $D$ of the vector space associated with the irrep for a given spin $j$ is given by the formula $D = 2j+1$. It is common to denote an irrep by its dimension in boldface, e.g., $\\mathbf{D}$.\n\nWhen two quantum systems with angular momenta described by spins $j_1$ and $j_2$ are combined, the resulting composite system is described by the tensor product of the corresponding representation spaces. This tensor product is generally a reducible representation, which can be decomposed into a direct sum of irreps. This decomposition is governed by the Clebsch-Gordan series, which states that the total angular momentum quantum number $J$ of the resulting irreps can take values in the range:\n$$\nJ = |j_1 - j_2|, |j_1 - j_2| + 1, \\dots, j_1 + j_2\n$$\nwhere the values of $J$ increase in integer steps.\n\nConsider the tensor product of two SU(2) irreps, denoted by their dimensions as $\\mathbf{4} \\otimes \\mathbf{5}$.

Mastering this concept is essential for accurately predicting the term symbols and energy levels of real atoms, highlighting the interplay between group theory and quantum statistics.", "problem": "In the study of atomic structure, the coupling of angular momenta is crucial for determining the allowed energy levels. For an atom with multiple electrons, the total angular momentum is found by combining the orbital and spin angular momenta of the individual electrons. A common approach is the Russell-Saunders (LS) coupling scheme, where the individual orbital angular momenta $\\vec{l}_i$ are coupled to form a total orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$, and the individual spin angular momenta $\\vec{s}_i$ are coupled to form a total spin angular momentum $\\vec{S}$. The total angular momentum of the atom, $\\vec{J}$, is then found by coupling $\\vec{L}$ and $\\vec{S}$.\n\nA critical consideration arises when dealing with *equivalent electrons*—electrons that share the same principal quantum number $n$ and orbital angular momentum quantum number $l$. The Pauli exclusion principle dictates that the total wavefunction of the system must be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of any two electrons. This imposes strong restrictions on the allowed combinations of $L$ and $S$.\n\nFor a system of two equivalent electrons with orbital quantum number $l$, the symmetry of the spatial part of the wavefunction depends on the total orbital quantum number $L$. The spatial wavefunction is symmetric under particle exchange if $L$ is even and antisymmetric if $L$ is odd. The spin part of the wavefunction for two electrons can either be a singlet state ($S=0$, antisymmetric) or a triplet state ($S=1$, symmetric). For the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric, a symmetric spatial part (even $L$) must be paired with an antisymmetric spin part ($S=0$), and an antisymmetric spatial part (odd $L$) must be paired with a symmetric spin part ($S=1$).\n\nConsider an atomic configuration consisting of two equivalent f-electrons ($l=3$). By applying the Pauli exclusion principle to the LS coupling scheme, determine all allowed term symbols and their corresponding total angular momentum quantum numbers $J$.
