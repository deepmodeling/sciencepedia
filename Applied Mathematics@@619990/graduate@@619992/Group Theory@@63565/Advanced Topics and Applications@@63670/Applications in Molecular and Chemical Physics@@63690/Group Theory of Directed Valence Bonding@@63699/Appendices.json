For an orbital to participate in $\\sigma$-bonding, it must have the same symmetry as one of the SALCs.\n\n-   The $3s$ orbital is spherically symmetric, so it always belongs to the totally symmetric irrep, which is $A_1$.\n-   The $3p$ orbitals transform as the Cartesian axes $x, y, z$. The problem statement provides the symmetries for these axes:\n    -   $3p_x$ transforms as $x$, which has $A_1$ symmetry.\n    -   $3p_y$ transforms as $y$, which has $B_2$ symmetry.\n    -   $3p_z$ transforms as $z$, which has $B_1$ symmetry.\n\nSummary of orbital symmetries:\n-   $Cl$ $3s$: $A_1$\n-   $Cl$ $3p_x$: $A_1$\n-   $Cl$ $3p_y$: $B_2$\n-   $Cl$ $3p_z$: $B_1$\n\nMatching SALCs and central orbitals for bonding:\n-   **$A_1$ symmetry**: There are two SALCs of $A_1$ symmetry and two central orbitals ($3s, 3p_x$) of $A_1$ symmetry. These can mix to form bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals (MOs).\n-   **$B_1$ symmetry**: There is one SALC of $B_1$ symmetry and one central orbital ($3p_z$) of $B_1$ symmetry. These can mix to form a bonding and an antibonding MO.\n-   **$B_2$ symmetry**: There are no SALCs of $B_2$ symmetry. The central $Cl$ $3p_y$ orbital has $B_2$ symmetry and thus cannot form a $\\sigma$-bond with the fluorine ligands. It remains a nonbonding orbital.\n\n**Step 4: Deduce lone pair placement**\n\nThe $\\text{ClF}_3$ molecule has a total of $7 + 3(7) = 28$ valence electrons. Three $\\sigma$-bonds account for $3 \\times 2 = 6$ electrons. The remaining $28 - 6 = 22$ electrons must occupy nonbonding orbitals. Each of the three fluorine atoms has three lone pairs (using orbitals not involved in $\\sigma$-bonding), which accounts for $3 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 18$ electrons. This leaves $22 - 18 = 4$ electrons, or two lone pairs, to be placed on the central chlorine atom.\n\nOur analysis identified one nonbonding orbital on the chlorine atom:\n1.  The $Cl$ $3p_y$ orbital, with $B_2$ symmetry. This orbital is perpendicular to the molecular plane and accommodates one lone pair.\n2.  The second lone pair must occupy another nonbonding or weakly bonding/antibonding MO. In the $A_1$ symmetry block, two central orbitals ($3s, 3p_x$) interact with two SALCs. This interaction produces four MOs. Two are bonding and are filled. The other two are antibonding. In a more refined picture of such molecules, one of these higher-energy MOs is effectively nonbonding and is predominantly localized on the central atom. This orbital has $A_1$ symmetry and holds the second lone pair. It is largely a hybrid of $Cl$ $3s$ and $3p_x$ orbitals.\n\nThe five electron domains around the central atom ($3$ bonding pairs, $2$ lone pairs) form a trigonal-bipyramidal (TBP) electron geometry. According to VSEPR theory, lone pairs occupy equatorial positions to minimize repulsion. The T-shaped molecular geometry of $\\text{ClF}_3$ results from the three fluorine atoms occupying two axial and one equatorial position, with the two lone pairs occupying the remaining two equatorial positions.\n\nOur MO analysis is consistent with this:\n-   The lone pair in the $Cl$ $3p_y$ orbital ($B_2$ symmetry) occupies an equatorial position in the TBP geometry.\n-   The lone pair in the $A_1$ nonbonding orbital (an $s-p_x$ hybrid) also occupies an equatorial position, pointing away from the equatorial Cl-F bond.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n-   **A. $\\Gamma_{\\sigma} = 2A_1 \\oplus B_1$. The $A_1$ SALCs mix with $Cl$ $3s$ and $3p_x$, and the $B_1$ SALC mixes with $Cl$ $3p_z$. The $Cl$ $3p_y$ ($B_2$) orbital has no matching SALC and is nonbonding; in addition, one predominantly $A_1$ nonbonding combination is largely $Cl$ $3s$ in character. These two nonbonding pairs reside on $Cl$ and occupy equatorial positions.**\n    This statement is fully consistent with our derivation.

Furthermore, it incorrectly claims $3p_z$ is nonbonding, while it has $B_1$ symmetry and participates in bonding. The description of lone pair placement is also inconsistent with VSEPR and MO theory.
