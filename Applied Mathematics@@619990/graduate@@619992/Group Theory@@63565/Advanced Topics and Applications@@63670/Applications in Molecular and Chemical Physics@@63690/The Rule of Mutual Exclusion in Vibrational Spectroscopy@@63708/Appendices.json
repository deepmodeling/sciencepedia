The underlying symmetry arguments are as follows.\n\nA vibrational mode is IR active if it transforms as any of the Cartesian coordinates $x$, $y$, or $z$, i.e., if it has the same symmetry as the dipole moment components. A vibrational mode is Raman active if it transforms as any quadratic form $x^{2}$, $y^{2}$, $z^{2}$, $xy$, $xz$, or $yz$, i.e., like the components of the polarizability tensor.\n\nUnder inversion $i$, the coordinates transform as $x \\to -x$, $y \\to -y$, $z \\to -z$, so $x$, $y$, $z$ are ungerade ($u$). Quadratic forms transform as $x^{2} \\to x^{2}$, $xy \\to xy$, etc., so they are gerade ($g$). In a centrosymmetric molecule, each normal mode has a definite $g/u$ parity.

By performing a complete vibrational analysis, you will reinforce the connection between symmetry and spectral activity and learn how to identify these elusive silent modes.", "problem": "Vibrational spectroscopy is a powerful tool for determining molecular structure. The activity of a molecule's fundamental vibrational modes in Infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy is governed by selection rules determined by molecular symmetry. A vibrational mode is IR active if it corresponds to a change in the molecule's dipole moment, and it is Raman active if it corresponds to a change in the molecule's polarizability. In terms of group theory, a mode is IR active if its irreducible representation (irrep) transforms as one of the Cartesian coordinates ($x, y, z$), and Raman active if its irrep transforms as one of the quadratic functions ($x^2, y^2, z^2, xy, xz, yz$).\n\nFor molecules that possess a center of inversion ($i$), the rule of mutual exclusion states that vibrational modes cannot be both IR and Raman active. Vibrations that are symmetric with respect to inversion (gerade, subscript $g$) can be Raman active, while vibrations that are antisymmetric (ungerade, subscript $u$) can be IR active. Some vibrational modes may be inactive in both IR and Raman spectra; these are known as \"silent\" modes.\n\nConsider a hypothetical molecule $\\text{AB}_2\\text{C}_6$ with $D_{3d}$ point group symmetry. The molecule's structure is defined as follows:\n- A single atom *A* is located at the origin, which is the center of inversion.\n- Two atoms of type *B* are located on the principal $C_3$ axis (the $z$-axis), at positions (0, 0, d) and (0, 0, -d).\n- Six atoms of type *C* are located off-axis. They form two equilateral triangles centered on the $z$-axis, in planes above and below the $xy$-plane. The triangle in the $z>0$ region is staggered with respect to the one in the $z0$ region, resulting in $D_{3d}$ symmetry.\n\nYour task is to calculate the total number of fundamental vibrational modes for the $\\text{AB}_2\\text{C}_6$ molecule that are completely silent, i.e., inactive in both IR and Raman spectroscopy.", "solution": "First, we determine the total number of vibrational modes. The molecule has $N=9$ atoms, so it has $3N = 27$ total degrees of freedom. As it is nonlinear, it has 3 translational and 3 rotational degrees of freedom, leaving $3N - 6 = 21$ fundamental vibrational modes.\n\nNext, we construct the reducible representation $\\Gamma_{\\text{tot}}$ for all 3N displacements. We find the characters, $\\chi(R)$, for each symmetry operation class in the $D_{3d}$ point group by determining the number of unshifted atoms, $N_U$.\n\n- **E**: All 9 atoms are unshifted. The character per atom is 3. $\\chi(E) = 9 \\times 3 = 27$.\n- **$2C_3$**: The 3 atoms on the $z$-axis (A and the two B atoms) are unshifted. The character per atom for a $C_3$ rotation is $1+2\\cos(120^\\circ) = 0$. $\\chi(C_3) = 3 \\times 0 = 0$.\n- **$3C_2$**: Only atom A at the origin is unshifted. The character per atom for a $C_2$ rotation is $1+2\\cos(180^\\circ) = -1$. $\\chi(C_2) = 1 \\times (-1) = -1$.\n- **$i$**: Only atom A at the center of inversion is unshifted. The character per atom for inversion is $-3$. $\\chi(i) = 1 \\times (-3) = -3$.\n- **$2S_6$**: Only atom A is unshifted. The character per atom for an $S_6$ operation is $2\\cos(60^\\circ)-1=0$. $\\chi(S_6) = 1 \\times 0 = 0$.\n- **$3\\sigma_d$**: Each reflection plane contains 5 atoms (A, the two B atoms, and two C atoms). The character per atom for reflection is 1. $\\chi(\\sigma_d) = 5 \\times 1 = 5$.\n\nThe resulting character set for $\\Gamma_{\\text{tot}}$ under the classes $(E, 2C_3, 3C_2, i, 2S_6, 3\\sigma_d)$ is $(27, 0, -1, -3, 0, 5)$. Using the reduction formula, we decompose this into irreducible representations (irreps):\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\text{tot}} = 3A_{1g} + 1A_{2g} + 4E_g + 1A_{1u} + 4A_{2u} + 5E_u $$\nTo find the vibrational modes, we subtract the representations for translation ($\\Gamma_{\\text{trans}} = A_{2u} + E_u$) and rotation ($\\Gamma_{\\text{rot}} = A_{2g} + E_g$):\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\text{vib}} = \\Gamma_{\\text{tot}} - \\Gamma_{\\text{trans}} - \\Gamma_{\\text{rot}} $$\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\text{vib}} = (3A_{1g} + 1A_{2g} + 4E_g + 1A_{1u} + 4A_{2u} + 5E_u) - (A_{2u} + E_u) - (A_{2g} + E_g) $$\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\text{vib}} = 3A_{1g} + 3E_g + 1A_{1u} + 3A_{2u} + 4E_u $$\nThe total number of modes is $3(1) + 3(2) + 1(1) + 3(1) + 4(2) = 3+6+1+3+8 = 21$, which matches our expectation.\n\nFinally, we identify the silent modes. In the $D_{3d}$ point group, IR active modes have $A_{2u}$ or $E_u$ symmetry, and Raman active modes have $A_{1g}$ or $E_g$ symmetry. Any vibrational mode with a different symmetry will be inactive in both spectroscopies. Looking at the irreps in $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}}$, the $A_{1g}$ and $E_g$ modes are Raman active, while the $A_{2u}$ and $E_u$ modes are IR active. The only remaining irrep in our set is $A_{1u}$. Since the coefficient of $A_{1u}$ in $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}}$ is 1, there is exactly one silent mode.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "824772"}]}
