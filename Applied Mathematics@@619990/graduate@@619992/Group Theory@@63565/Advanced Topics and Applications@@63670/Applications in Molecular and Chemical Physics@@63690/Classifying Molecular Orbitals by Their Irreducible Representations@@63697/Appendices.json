These SALCs transform according to the irreducible representations (irreps) of the molecule's point group. A powerful method to determine which irreps are spanned by a given set of atomic orbitals is to first generate a (generally) reducible representation, $\\Gamma$, and then decompose it into its constituent irreps.\n\nConsider the water molecule ($H_2O$), which belongs to the $C_{2v}$ point group.
