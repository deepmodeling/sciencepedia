This distortion is described by the normal mode of $E_g$ symmetry, which leads to an elongation or compression along one axis and a corresponding compression or elongation in the perpendicular plane. Let's consider the distortion corresponding to elongation along the z-axis, which lowers the symmetry to $D_{4h}$.
