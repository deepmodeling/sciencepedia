The symmetric spatial part is found by decomposing the symmetric direct product $[t_2 \\otimes t_2]_{\\text{sym}}$.\n\n**3. Character Analysis of the Direct Product**\nThe spatial representation is $t_2 \\otimes t_2$. We first need the characters for this direct product and its symmetric part.

So, $\\chi^{t_2}(E^2) = \\chi^{t_2}(E) = 3$.\n- For $g \\in 8C_3$: $g^2 = (C_3)^2 = C_3^{-1}$. A $C_3^{-1}$ rotation is in the same class as $C_3$. So, $\\chi^{t_2}((C_3)^2) = \\chi^{t_2}(C_3) = 0$.\n- For $g \\in 3C_2$: $g^2 = (C_2)^2 = E$. So, $\\chi^{t_2}((C_2)^2) = \\chi^{t_2}(E) = 3$.\n- For $g \\in 6S_4$: $g^2 = (S_4)^2 = C_2$.

The term symbols for the singlet states are $^1A_1$, $^1E$, and $^1T_2$.\nThe problem asks for the sum of the dimensions of these spatial irreps. The dimension of an irrep is its character under the identity operation, $\\chi^\\Gamma(E)$.\n- $\\dim(A_1) = \\chi^{A_1}(E) = 1$\n- $\\dim(E) = \\chi^{E}(E) = 2$\n- $\\dim(T_2) = \\chi^{T_2}(E) = 3$\n\nThe sum of the dimensions is:\n$$ \\text{Sum} = \\dim(A_1) + \\dim(E) + \\dim(T_2) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 $$\n\n(For completeness, the antisymmetric spatial part, $\\{t_2 \\otimes t_2\\}_{\\text{anti}}$, corresponds to the triplet state $S=1$. Its character is $\\chi^{\\{t_2 \\otimes t_2\\}_{\\text{anti}}} = (3, 0, -1, 1, -1)$, which matches the irrep $T_1$. So the triplet term is $^3T_1$. The total number of microstates is $1\\times\\dim(A_1) + 1\\times\\dim(E) + 1\\times\\dim(T_2) + 3\\times\\dim(T_1) = 1(1) + 1(2) + 1(3) + 3(3) = 1+2+3+9=15$.
