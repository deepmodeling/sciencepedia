This exercise provides a foundational practice for this essential skill. By constructing and decomposing the magnetic representation for magnons in a model antiferromagnet, you will see precisely how group theory predicts the number of distinct magnon modes and their symmetries, which are directly observable in experiments like inelastic neutron scattering and Raman spectroscopy. This problem [@problem_id:701017] is a hands-on walkthrough of the central computational tool in the group theory of magnons.", "problem": "Consider a simplified model of an A-type tetragonal antiferromagnet. The crystal structure has a point group symmetry of $D_{4h}$. Within the chemical unit cell, there are two magnetic ions, labeled 1 and 2, which are located on the primary rotation axis (the $z$-axis). These two ions form the basis of a magnetic unit cell. In the ground state, the spins are aligned collinearly with the $z$-axis but in opposite directions: spin $\\mathbf{S}_1$ is \"up\" ($+S\\hat{z}$) and spin $\\mathbf{S}_2$ is \"down\" ($-S\\hat{z}$).\n\nWe are interested in the collective spin excitations (magnons) at the center of the magnetic Brillouin zone ($\\mathbf{k}=0$). The symmetry of these magnon modes can be classified according to the irreducible representations (irreps) of the crystal point group $D_{4h}$. The basis for the spin deviations on the two ions can be conveniently written in terms of circular components: $\\{S_1^+, S_1^-, S_2^+, S_2^-\\}$, where $S_j^\\pm = \\delta S_{jx} \\pm i\\delta S_{jy}$ represents the small transverse spin deviations for ion $j \\in \\{1,2\\}$.\n\nThe transformation of these spin deviation operators is determined by the action of the symmetry operations of the $D_{4h}$ group on both the ion positions and the spin components. Any operation $g$ in $D_{4h}$ that exchanges the positions of the two ions will map the spin deviations of ion 1 to ion 2, and vice versa. The spin itself is a pseudovector (or axial vector), so its components transform under a group operation $R \\in O(3)$ according to the rule $\\mathbf{S}' = \\det(R) R \\mathbf{S}$.\n\nYour task is to determine the number of distinct one-magnon modes at $\\mathbf{k}=0$. A mode is considered distinct if it transforms according to a different irreducible representation of the point group $D_{4h}$. To solve this, you must first find the characters of the magnetic representation, $\\Gamma_{mag}$, which is built on the 4-dimensional basis $\\{S_1^+, S_1^-, S_2^+, S_2^-\\}$, and then decompose this representation into the irreps of $D_{4h}$.\n\nThe character table for the point group $D_{4h}$ is provided below.
