In this picture, electrons occupy a sphere of states in momentum space up to the Fermi energy. This exercise explores the limit of this simple model by asking a critical question: what happens when the Fermi surface grows large enough to interact with the underlying structure of the crystal, represented by the Brillouin zone? By calculating the critical electron density at which the Fermi circle first touches the Brillouin zone boundary [@problem_id:828289], you will gain a concrete understanding of why the free electron approximation must give way to a more sophisticated description, namely Bloch's theorem, which accounts for the lattice's periodic potential.", "problem": "**Background**\n\nIn solid-state physics, the behavior of electrons in a crystalline solid is profoundly influenced by the periodic potential of the atomic lattice. The translational symmetry of the lattice gives rise to the concept of a reciprocal lattice in momentum space (k-space).

The radius of this circle is the Fermi wavevector, $k_F$. The number density of electrons, $n$ (number of electrons per unit area), is related to the Fermi wavevector by the formula:\n$$n = \\frac{k_F^2}{2\\pi}$$\nAs the electron density $n$ increases, the radius $k_F$ of the Fermi circle expands. A critical point is reached when the Fermi circle first makes contact with the boundary of the first Brillouin Zone.
