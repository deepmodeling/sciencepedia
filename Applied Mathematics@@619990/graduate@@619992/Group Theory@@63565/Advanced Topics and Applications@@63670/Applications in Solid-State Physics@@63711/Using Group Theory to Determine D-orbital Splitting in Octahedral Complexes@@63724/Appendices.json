The symmetry of this splitting can be elegantly determined using group theory.\n\nConsider a metal ion at the center of an octahedral complex. The Cartesian axes $(x, y, z)$ are aligned with the metal-ligand bonds, which correspond to the $C_4$ axes of the octahedron. The five real d-orbitals can be represented by functions proportional to certain combinations of Cartesian coordinates. For this problem, we define the basis of d-orbital functions as the set $B = \\{\\psi_1, \\psi_2, \\psi_3, \\psi_4, \\psi_5\\}$, where:\n- $\\psi_1 = 2z^2 - x^2 - y^2$ (proportional to $d_{z^2}$)\n- $\\psi_2 = x^2 - y^2$ (proportional to $d_{x^2-y^2}$)\n- $\\psi_3 = xy$ (proportional to $d_{xy}$)\n- $\\psi_4 = xz$ (proportional to $d_{xz}$)\n- $\\psi_5 = yz$ (proportional to $d_{yz}$)\n\nThis set of five functions forms a basis for a 5-dimensional representation of the octahedral point group $O_h$. Now, consider a symmetry operation corresponding to a $C_3$ rotation about an axis passing through the origin and the point $(1, 1, 1)$. This operation cyclically permutes the coordinate axes, transforming a point $(x, y, z)$ to a new point $(x', y', z') = (y, z, x)$.\n\nYour task is to derive the character, $\\chi(C_3)$, of the $5 \\times 5$ matrix that represents this $C_3$ rotation operator in the specified basis $B$.", "solution": "We seek the character $\\chi(C_3)=\\text{Tr}\\,D(C_3)$ for the 5-dimensional basis of functions under the cyclic rotation $R:(x,y,z) \\to (y,z,x)$.
