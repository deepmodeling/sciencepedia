The charge-conjugated spinor $\\psi^c$ is defined as $\\psi^c = C\\bar{\\psi}^T$, where $\\bar{\\psi} = \\psi^\\dagger\\gamma^0$ and $C$ is the charge conjugation matrix.

Next, use a charge conjugation identity to \"flip\" the second bilinear term. The relevant identity is $(\\bar{\\psi}_a \\Gamma \\psi_b) = (\\bar{\\psi}_b^c C \\Gamma^T C^{-1} \\psi_a^c)$. Applying this to $(\\bar{\\psi}_3\\gamma_\\mu\\psi_2)$:\n    $$ (\\bar{\\psi}_3\\gamma_\\mu\\psi_2) = (\\bar{\\psi}_2^c C \\gamma_\\mu^T C^{-1} \\psi_3^c) $$\n3.  We simplify the matrix product $C \\gamma_\\mu^T C^{-1}$. Using the property $C^{-1}\\gamma_\\mu C = -\\gamma_\\mu^T$, we can write $\\gamma_\\mu^T = -C^{-1}\\gamma_\\mu C$. Substituting this gives:\n    $$ C \\gamma_\\mu^T C^{-1} = C (-C^{-1}\\gamma_\\mu C) C^{-1} = -C C^{-1} \\gamma_\\mu C C^{-1} = -\\gamma_\\mu $$\n4.

The expression now has the form $(\\bar{A}\\gamma^\\mu B)(\\bar{C}\\gamma_\\mu D)$. A standard Fierz identity states this is equivalent to $2(\\bar{A}P_R D)(\\bar{C}P_L B) + 2(\\bar{A}P_L D)(\\bar{C}P_R B)$.

The question asks for the coefficient of $(\\bar{\\psi}_1\\psi_3^c)(\\bar{\\psi}_4^c\\psi_2)$.

We can find this by summing the projected terms, since $\\mathbb{I} = P_L + P_R$. The expression $(\\bar{\\psi}_1\\psi_3^c)(\\bar{\\psi}_4^c\\psi_2)$ contains all four combinations of projectors ($LL, LR, RL, RR$). The identity above only gives the $LR$ and $RL$ combinations. Thus, the vector-vector interaction is not equal to the scalar-scalar interaction in the conjugated channel; it is equal to a specific part of it. However, if we are asked for the coefficient of the full scalar-scalar term in an expansion that includes other Lorentz structures (Tensor, etc.), the coefficient is -2.\n\nThe scalar term is extracted by summing over projectors:\n$$ -2 (\\bar{\\psi}_1\\psi_3^c)(\\bar{\\psi}_4^c\\psi_2) = -2(\\bar{\\psi}_1(P_L+P_R)\\psi_3^c)(\\bar{\\psi}_4^c(P_L+P_R)\\psi_2) $$\nThe Fierz identity shows that only the mixed-chirality terms contribute to the vector-vector product.
