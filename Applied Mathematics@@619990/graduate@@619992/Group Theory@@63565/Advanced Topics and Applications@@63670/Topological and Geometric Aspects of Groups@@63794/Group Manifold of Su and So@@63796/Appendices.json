This exercise explores the limitations of the Cayley map for the rotation group $SO(3)$, asking you to identify which rotations cannot be generated by it. This practice is crucial for understanding that such maps are not always surjective and reveals a deep connection between algebraic properties and the geometric nature of rotations [@problem_id:691119].", "problem": "**Background:**\nThe special orthogonal group in three dimensions, denoted $\\text{SO(3)}$, consists of $3 \\times 3$ real matrices $R$ that satisfy $R^T R = I$ and $\\det(R) = 1$. Each such matrix represents a rotation in 3D Euclidean space. Any rotation $R \\in \\text{SO(3)}$ is characterized by an axis of rotation and an angle $\\theta$. By convention, the rotation angle is taken to be in the interval $[0, \\pi]$.\n\nThe Lie algebra of $SO(3)$, denoted $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$, is the space of $3 \\times 3$ real, skew-symmetric matrices. A crucial connection between the Lie algebra and the Lie group is given by the Cayley map, defined as:\n$$ \\text{Cay}: \\mathfrak{so}(3) \\to \\text{SO(3)} $$\n$$ X \\mapsto R = (I+X)(I-X)^{-1} $$\nwhere $X \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$ and $I$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix. This map is only defined for matrices $X$ for which $(I-X)$ is invertible.\n\nThe image of the Cayley map, $\\text{Im}(\\text{Cay})$, does not cover the entire $SO(3)$ group. There exists a subset of rotation matrices that cannot be generated via the Cayley map from any element of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$.\n\n**Problem:**\nDetermine the value of the rotation angle $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$ for any rotation matrix $R \\in SO(3)$ that lies outside the image of the Cayley map.", "solution": "**1.

We can solve this equation for $X$ to find the inverse map, the Cayley transform, from the group to the algebra.\n$$ R = (I+X)(I-X)^{-1} $$\nMultiplying by $(I-X)$ on the right gives:\n$$ R(I-X) = I+X $$\n$$ R - RX = I + X $$\nRearranging the terms to solve for $X$:\n$$ R - I = RX + X $$\n$$ R - I = (R+I)X $$\nThis leads to the expression for $X$:\n$$ X = (R+I)^{-1}(R-I) $$\nThis expression for $X$ is well-defined if and only if the matrix $(R+I)$ is invertible. If $(R+I)$ is not invertible, then we cannot find a corresponding $X$. Therefore, a rotation matrix $R$ is not in the image of the Cayley map if and only if $(R+I)$ is a singular matrix.\n\n**2.

The condition for $R$ to be outside the image of the Cayley map is:\n$$ \\det(R+I) = 0 $$\nLet the eigenvalues of $R$ be $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3$. Then the eigenvalues of the matrix $(R+I)$ are $(\\lambda_1+1), (\\lambda_2+1), (\\lambda_3+1)$. The determinant of a matrix is the product of its eigenvalues. Thus,\n$$ \\det(R+I) = (\\lambda_1+1)(\\lambda_2+1)(\\lambda_3+1) = 0 $$\nThis equation holds if and only if at least one of the eigenvalues of $R$ is equal to $-1$.\n\n**3. Determine the eigenvalues of a general rotation matrix.**\n\nAny rotation $R \\in SO(3)$ by an angle $\\theta$ about some axis has a set of three eigenvalues that are independent of the choice of axis. In a coordinate system where the axis of rotation is the z-axis, the matrix has the form:\n$$ R' = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta & 0 \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe eigenvalues are found from the characteristic polynomial $\\det(R' - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta-\\lambda & -\\sin\\theta & 0 \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta-\\lambda & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (1-\\lambda) \\left[ (\\cos\\theta-\\lambda)^2 + \\sin^2\\theta \\right] = 0 $$\n$$ (1-\\lambda) \\left[ \\lambda^2 - 2\\lambda\\cos\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta + \\sin^2\\theta \\right] = 0 $$\n$$ (1-\\lambda) \\left[ \\lambda^2 - 2\\lambda\\cos\\theta + 1 \\right] = 0 $$\nOne eigenvalue is clearly $\\lambda_1=1$.

Solve for the rotation angle $\\theta$.**\n\nFrom step 2, for a matrix $R$ to be outside the image of the Cayley map, one of its eigenvalues must be $-1$. From step 3, the eigenvalues are $\\{1, e^{i\\theta}, e^{-i\\theta}\\}$.\nThe eigenvalue $1$ is always present (for non-identity rotations). Setting one of the other eigenvalues to $-1$:\n$$ e^{i\\theta} = -1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad e^{-i\\theta} = -1 $$\nBoth equations are equivalent. Using Euler's formula, $e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta$, the condition becomes:\n$$ \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta = -1 $$\nEquating the real and imaginary parts, we get:\n$$ \\cos\\theta = -1 $$\n$$ \\sin\\theta = 0 $$\nThe problem specifies that the angle of rotation $\\theta$ is in the interval $[0, \\pi]$. The only value of $\\theta$ in this interval for which $\\cos\\theta = -1$ is:\n$$ \\theta = \\pi $$\nFor this angle, $\\sin\\pi = 0$, so the second condition is also satisfied.\n\nThus, any rotation matrix in $SO(3)$ that is not in the image of the Cayley map must correspond to a rotation by the angle $\\pi$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\pi} $$", "id": "691119"}, {"introduction": "The adjoint action describes how a Lie group acts on its own Lie algebra, providing a window into the group's internal symmetries and dynamics.
