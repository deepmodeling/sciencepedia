Each element of this group is called a permutation. A permutation is called a *transposition* if it swaps two elements and leaves all others fixed. Any non-identity permutation can be written as a product of transpositions. A permutation is called *even* if it can be written as a product of an even number of transpositions, and *odd* if it can be written as a product of an odd number of transpositions.

In this problem, all permutations are written in disjoint cycle notation, and the composition of permutations is performed from right to left. For any two elements $g, h$ in a group, their commutator is defined as $[g,h] = ghg^{-1}h^{-1}$.\n\nA fundamental property of the alternating group $A_n$ for $n \\ge 5$ is that its commutator subgroup is $A_n$ itself. This implies that every element of $A_n$, including any 3-cycle, can be expressed as the commutator of two other elements in $A_n$.\n\nOne specific constructive method to find such a pair for a given 3-cycle $(a,b,c)$ is to choose two distinct auxiliary elements, $d$ and $e$, that are not in the set $\\{a,b,c\\}$. The 3-cycle $(a,b,c)$ can then be generated as the commutator $[g,h]$, where $g=(a,b,d)$ and $h=(a,c,e)$.\n\nYour task is to apply this construction to a specific case.
