We need to find all pairs $(o_1, o_2)$ such that $\\operatorname{lcm}(o_1, o_2) = 20$.\n\nAccording to Lagrange's theorem, the order of an element in a finite group must divide the order of the group.\nThe possible orders $o_1$ for an element $g \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ are the positive divisors of 12. The set of divisors of 12 is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\\}$.\nThe possible orders $o_2$ for an element $h \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{10}$ are the positive divisors of 10.

We can analyze this using prime factorizations. The prime factorization of 20 is $2^2 \\cdot 5^1$.

For a permutation, the order is the least common multiple of the lengths of its disjoint cycles. Therefore, to have order $10$, the cycle structure must have lengths whose least common multiple is $10$. This forces the presence of a cycle length divisible by $5$, i.e., a $5$-cycle or a $10$-cycle, and possibly some $2$-cycles; $1$-cycles (fixed points) do not affect the order or parity.\n\nThe sign of a $k$-cycle is $(-1)^{k-1}$.
