For any element $(x,y) \\in G$, we must have $(x,y) * (e_1, e_2) = (x,y)$.\n$$\n(x + (-1)^y e_1, y+e_2) = (x,y)\n$$\nThis yields a system of two equations:\n1. $y + e_2 = y \\implies e_2 = 0$\n2. $x + (-1)^y e_1 = x \\implies (-1)^y e_1 = 0 \\implies e_1 = 0$\nWe verify that $(0,0)$ is also a left identity: $(0,0) * (x,y) = (0 + (-1)^0 x, 0+y) = (x,y)$.\nThus, the identity element is $e = (0,0)$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the inverse of a generic element**\nLet $g = (x,y)$ be an element of $G$. We want to find its inverse $g^{-1} = (u,v)$ such that $g*g^{-1}=e$.\n$$\n(x,y) * (u,v) = (0,0)\n$$\n$$\n(x + (-1)^y u, y+v) = (0,0)\n$$\nThis gives two equations:\n1. $y+v=0 \\implies v = -y$\n2. $x + (-1)^y u = 0 \\implies (-1)^y u = -x \\implies u = -x / (-1)^y = -x(-1)^{-y}$\nSince $y$ is an integer, $(-1)^{-y} = (-1)^y$. So, $u = -x(-1)^y$.\nThe inverse of $(x,y)$ is $(-x(-1)^y, -y)$. We can verify this is a left inverse as well:\n$(-x(-1)^y, -y) * (x,y) = (-x(-1)^y + (-1)^{-y}x, -y+y) = (-x(-1)^y + (-1)^y x, 0) = (0,0)$.\nSo, for a generic element $(x,y) \\in G$, its inverse is $(x,y)^{-1} = (-x(-1)^y, -y)$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the inverses of $g_1$ and $g_2$**\nUsing the formula from Step 2:\nFor $g_1 = (a,b)$, its inverse is $g_1^{-1} = (-a(-1)^b, -b)$.\nFor $g_2 = (c,d)$, its inverse is $g_2^{-1} = (-c(-1)^d, -d)$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the products required for the commutator**\nFirst, we calculate $g_1 * g_2$:\n$$\ng_1 * g_2 = (a,b) * (c,d) = (a + (-1)^b c, b+d)\n$$\nNext, we calculate $g_1^{-1} * g_2^{-1}$:\n$$\ng_1^{-1} * g_2^{-1} = (-a(-1)^b, -b) * (-c(-1)^d, -d)\n$$\nUsing the group operation rule, with first element $(-a(-1)^b, -b)$ and second element $(-c(-1)^d, -d)$:\n$$\n= ( -a(-1)^b + (-1)^{-b} (-c(-1)^d), -b + (-d) )\n$$\n$$\n= ( -a(-1)^b - (-1)^{-b}(-1)^d c, -(b+d) )\n$$\nSince $(-1)^{-b} = (-1)^b$, we can write this as:\n$$\n= ( -a(-1)^b - (-1)^{d-b} c, -(b+d) )\n$$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final commutator product**\nNow we compute the full commutator $[g_1, g_2] = (g_1 * g_2) * (g_1^{-1} * g_2^{-1})$.\nLet $X = g_1 * g_2 = (a + (-1)^b c, b+d)$\nLet $Y = g_1^{-1} * g_2^{-1} = (-a(-1)^b - (-1)^{d-b} c, -(b+d))$\nWe need to compute $X*Y$. Let $X = (A,B)$ and $Y=(C,D)$. The product is $(A + (-1)^B C, B+D)$.\nThe second component is $B+D = (b+d) + (-(b+d)) = 0$.\nThe first component is $A + (-1)^B C$:\n$$\n(a + (-1)^b c) + (-1)^{b+d} \\left( -a(-1)^b - (-1)^{d-b} c \\right)\n$$\nDistributing the $(-1)^{b+d}$ term:\n$$\n= (a + (-1)^b c) - (-1)^{b+d}(-1)^b a - (-1)^{b+d}(-1)^{d-b} c\n$$\nSimplify the exponents:\n$$\n= a + (-1)^b c - (-1)^{2b+d} a - (-1)^{2d} c\n$$\nSince $b$ and $d$ are integers, $2b$ and $2d$ are even.
