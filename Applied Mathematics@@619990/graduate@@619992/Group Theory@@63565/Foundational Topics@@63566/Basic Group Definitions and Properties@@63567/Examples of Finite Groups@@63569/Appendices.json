This practice problem offers a direct application of the first Sylow theorem, a result that guarantees the existence of subgroups of prime-power order.

The order of this group, denoted $|S_n|$, is equal to $n!$.\n\nIn the study of finite group structures, subgroups whose order is a power of a prime number play a crucial role. For a given finite group $G$ and a prime $p$, a subgroup $H$ of $G$ is called a $p$-subgroup if its order, $|H|$, is equal to $p^k$ for some non-negative integer $k$.\n\nConsider the symmetric group $S_6$. We are interested in the 3-subgroups of $S_6$ that have the largest possible order among all 3-subgroups. What is the order of such a subgroup?", "solution": "We consider $G=S_{6}$ with order\n$$\n|S_{6}|=6!=720=2^{4}\\cdot 3^{2}\\cdot 5.\n$$\nBy Sylow’s theorems, for a prime $p$, any Sylow $p$-subgroup of a finite group $G$ has order equal to the highest power of $p$ dividing $|G|$. Taking $p=3$, the highest power of $3$ dividing $|S_{6}|$ is $3^{2}$. Therefore any Sylow $3$-subgroup has order\n$$\n3^{2}=9,\n$$\nand hence the largest $3$-subgroups (the Sylow $3$-subgroups) of $S_{6}$ have order $9$.
