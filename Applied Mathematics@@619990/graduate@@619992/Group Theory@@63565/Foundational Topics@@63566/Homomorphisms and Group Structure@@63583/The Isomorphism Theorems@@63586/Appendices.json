Symbolically, this is $G/\\ker(\\phi) \\cong \\text{im}(\\phi)$.\n\nIn this problem, the domain group is $G = \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$ and the codomain group is $H = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the kernel of the homomorphism $\\phi$, denoted $\\ker(\\phi)$. The kernel is the set of all elements in the domain $G$ that map to the identity element in the codomain $H$. The identity element in the group $(\\mathbb{Z}, +)$ is $0$.\nSo, we are looking for all pairs $(a, b) \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $\\phi(a, b) = 0$.\n$$ \\phi(a, b) = a - 2b = 0 $$\nThis equation implies $a = 2b$. Therefore, any element in the kernel must be of the form $(2b, b)$ where $b$ is an integer.\nThe kernel is the set:\n$$ \\ker(\\phi) = \\{ (2b, b) \\mid b \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\} $$\nThis set is a subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$. We can recognize this as the set of all integer multiples of the element $(2, 1)$. This is the cyclic subgroup generated by $(2, 1)$, which is denoted by $\\langle (2, 1) \\rangle$.\nSo, $\\ker(\\phi) = \\langle (2, 1) \\rangle$.\n\nNext, we identify the image of the homomorphism, $\\text{im}(\\phi)$. The problem statement explicitly says that the homomorphism $\\phi$ is surjective. For a surjective map, the image is equal to the entire codomain.\nTherefore, $\\text{im}(\\phi) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNow, we apply the First Isomorphism Theorem, $G/\\ker(\\phi) \\cong \\text{im}(\\phi)$, by substituting the groups and subgroups we have found:\n$$ (\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}) / \\langle (2, 1) \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z} $$\n\nFinally, we compare this result with the given multiple-choice options.\n\nA. $(\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}) / \\langle (1, 2) \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.

So this is incorrect.\n\nB. $(\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}) / \\langle (1, -2) \\rangle \\cong \\{0\\}$. The kernel is incorrectly identified, and the image is also incorrect. The image is $\\mathbb{Z}$, not the trivial group $\\{0\\}$. So this is incorrect.\n\nC. $(\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}) / \\langle (2, 1) \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.
