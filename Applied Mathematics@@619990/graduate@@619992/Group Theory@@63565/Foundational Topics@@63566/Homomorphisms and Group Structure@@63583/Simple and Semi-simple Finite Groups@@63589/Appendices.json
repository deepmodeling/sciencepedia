Finally, we count the number of elements that have this maximal order.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the orders of elements in $A_5$.**\nThe elements of $A_5$ are the even permutations of 5 elements. The cycle structure of a permutation determines its order. The possible cycle structures for even permutations in $S_5$ are:\n1.  The identity: `(1)`. Cycle structure $1^5$.

Pairs of disjoint 2-cycles (transpositions): `(ab)(cd)`. Cycle structure $2^2 1^1$. The order is 2.\n\nOther cycle structures in $S_5$, like a single 2-cycle (odd), a 4-cycle (odd), or a 3-cycle with a 2-cycle (odd), are not in $A_5$.\nThus, the set of possible orders of elements in $A_5$ is $\\{1, 2, 3, 5\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the maximal order of an element in $G = A_5 \\times A_5$.**\nThe order of an element $g = (g_1, g_2) \\in G$ is $o(g) = \\text{lcm}(o(g_1), o(g_2))$, where $o(g_1)$ and $o(g_2)$ can be any value from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 5\\}$.

This is $N_3 \\times N_5$.\nThe number of elements for Case 2 is similarly $N_5 \\times N_3$.\n\nThe total number of elements of order 15 is the sum of the counts from these two cases:\n$$ \\text{Total Number} = (N_3 \\times N_5) + (N_5 \\times N_3) = 2 N_3 N_5 $$\nSubstituting the values we calculated:\n$$ \\text{Total Number} = 2 \\times 20 \\times 24 = 2 \\times 480 = 960 $$\nThus, there are 960 elements of maximal order 15 in the group $G = A_5 \\times A_5$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{960}\n$$", "id": "771900"}, {"introduction": "One of the most profound connections in modern algebra is the bridge between a group's structure and its representation theory.
