The possible orders of elements in $A_4$ are 1, 2, and 3.

This set contains all elements of $A_4$ whose order divides 2. It is known as the Klein four-group and is a subgroup of $A_4$.\nThe number of choices for $h_1$ is the number of elements in this set, which is $|V| = 4$.\n\n**Condition 2: Find all possible choices for $h_2$.**\nThe condition is $h_2^2 = e$, so $\\text{ord}(h_2)$ must divide 2.
