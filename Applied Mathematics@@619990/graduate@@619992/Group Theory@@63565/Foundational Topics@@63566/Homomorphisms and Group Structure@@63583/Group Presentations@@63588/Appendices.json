Instead of just manipulating elements within the group, we can often use the given relations to systematically eliminate generators. This exercise demonstrates how this technique, an intuitive approach related to Tietze transformations, can distill a complex presentation down to its essential structure and thereby determine the group's order [@problem_id:693754].", "problem": "In combinatorial group theory, a group $G$ can be specified by a set of generators $S$ and a set of relations $R$ among those generators.

A fundamental result is Tietze's theorem, which states that any two finite presentations for the same group can be transformed into one another by a finite sequence of elementary changes called Tietze transformations. These transformations allow for simplifying complex presentations. A common strategy involves using the relations to substitute and eliminate generators.\n\nConsider the group $G$ defined by the presentation with three generators $a, b, c$ and three relations:\n$$\nG = \\langle a, b, c \\mid b=a^2, c=b^2, a=c^2 \\rangle\n$$\nBy systematically applying transformations implied by the relations, simplify this presentation to determine the structure of the group.\n\nDerive the order of the group $G$, denoted as $|G|$.", "solution": "We have the presentation\n$$\nG=\\langle a,b,c \\mid b=a^2,\\;c=b^2,\\;a=c^2\\rangle.\n$$\n1.
