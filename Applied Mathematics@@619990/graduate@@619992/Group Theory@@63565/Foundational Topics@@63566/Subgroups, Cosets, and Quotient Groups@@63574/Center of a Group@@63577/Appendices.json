From $bab=a^{-1}$, we prove by induction that\n$$\nb a^{k} b = a^{-k} \\quad \\text{for all integers } k.\n$$\nThe base case $k=1$ is the given relation.

Thus among the powers of $a$, precisely $e$ and $a^{2}$ commute with $b$. Therefore $e$ and $a^{2}$ commute with both generators $a$ and $b$, so $e,a^{2}\\in Z(G)$.\n\nNext, consider elements of the form $a^{i} b$.

An element $(g, h) \\in G_1 \\times G_2$ is in the center $Z(G_1 \\times G_2)$ if and only if it commutes with every element $(x, y) \\in G_1 \\times G_2$.\nThe condition for commutation is $(g, h) \\cdot (x, y) = (x, y) \\cdot (g, h)$.\nUsing the definition of the operation in the direct product group, this becomes:\n$$ (g x, h + y) = (x g, y + h) $$\n(Note: we use multiplicative notation for the abstract group $G_1$ and additive notation for $G_2=\\mathbb{Z}_5$).\nThis equality of ordered pairs holds if and only if the components are equal:\n1. $gx = xg$ for all $x \\in G_1$.\n2. $h + y = y + h$ for all $y \\in G_2$.\n\nThe first condition means that $g$ must be an element of the center of $G_1$, so $g \\in Z(G_1)$.\nThe second condition means that $h$ must be an element of the center of $G_2$, so $h \\in Z(G_2)$.\nTherefore, an element $(g,h)$ is in $Z(G_1 \\times G_2)$ if and only if $g \\in Z(G_1)$ and $h \\in Z(G_2)$. This confirms that $Z(G_1 \\times G_2) = Z(G_1) \\times Z(G_2)$.\n\nNow, we apply this to our specific case, $G = S_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5$. We need to find the centers of $S_3$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_5$ individually.\n\n**Step 1: Find the center of $S_3$, denoted $Z(S_3)$.**\nThe group $S_3$ is the group of permutations of $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$. Its elements are:\n$e$ (the identity), $(12)$, $(13)$, $(23)$ (the transpositions), and $(123)$, $(132)$ (the 3-cycles).\n$S_3$ is a non-abelian group. We need to find which elements commute with all other elements.\nThe identity element $e$ always commutes with everything, so $e \\in Z(S_3)$.\nLet's test a transposition, say $(12)$. We check if it commutes with another element, for instance $(13)$:\n$(12)(13) = (132)$\n$(13)(12) = (123)$\nSince $(12)(13) \\neq (13)(12)$, the element $(12)$ is not in the center of $S_3$. A similar argument shows that no transposition is in the center.\nNow let's test a 3-cycle, say $(123)$. We check if it commutes with $(12)$:\n$(123)(12) = (13)$\n$(12)(123) = (23)$\nSince $(123)(12) \\neq (12)(123)$, the element $(123)$ is not in the center of $S_3$. A similar argument applies to $(132)$.\nThus, the only element in $S_3$ that commutes with all other elements is the identity element $e$.\nSo, $Z(S_3) = \\{e\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the center of $\\mathbb{Z}_5$, denoted $Z(\\mathbb{Z}_5)$.**\nThe group $\\mathbb{Z}_5 = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ with the operation of addition modulo 5 is a cyclic group, and all cyclic groups are abelian. An abelian group is one in which the operation is commutative for all pairs of elements. By definition of the center, if a group is abelian, its center is the entire group itself.\nTherefore, $Z(\\mathbb{Z}_5) = \\mathbb{Z}_5 = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results.**\nUsing the property $Z(S_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5) = Z(S_3) \\times Z(\\mathbb{Z}_5)$, we substitute the centers we found:\n$Z(S_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5) = \\{e\\} \\times \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\nThis means the center of $G$ consists of all ordered pairs where the first element is the identity permutation $e$ from $S_3$ and the second element is any element from $\\mathbb{Z}_5$.\nThe elements are:\n$(e, 0), (e, 1), (e, 2), (e, 3), (e, 4)$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, we see that it matches option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1815995"}, {"introduction": "Moving from specific examples to general properties is a key step in developing mathematical maturity.
