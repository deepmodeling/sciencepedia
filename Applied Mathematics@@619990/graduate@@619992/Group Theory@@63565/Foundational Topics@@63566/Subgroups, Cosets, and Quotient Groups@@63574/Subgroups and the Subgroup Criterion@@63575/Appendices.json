We need to count the number of matrices that satisfy the given conditions.\n\n1.  **Identify the form of matrices in H.**\n    The problem states that $H$ is a subgroup of $GL_2(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ consisting of upper-triangular matrices with equal diagonal entries. A general $2 \\times 2$ upper-triangular matrix with entries in the field $\\mathbb{F}_p$ has the form:\n    $$ M = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & d \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    where $a, b, d \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$. The condition that the diagonal entries are equal implies $d = a$. Thus, any matrix in $H$ must be of the form:\n    $$ M = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & a \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    for some $a, b \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$.\n\n2.  **Apply the invertibility condition.**\n    For a matrix $M$ to be an element of the general linear group $GL_2(\\mathbb{F}_p)$, it must be invertible. A matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is non-zero. The determinant of $M$ is:\n    $$ \\det(M) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & a \\end{pmatrix} = (a)(a) - (b)(0) = a^2 $$\n    The condition for invertibility is $\\det(M) \\neq 0$. In the field $\\mathbb{F}_p$, this means:\n    $$ a^2 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{p} $$\n    Since $p$ is a prime number, $\\mathbb{F}_p$ is a field. In a field, a product $xy=0$ if and only if $x=0$ or $y=0$. Therefore, the condition $a^2 \\neq 0$ is equivalent to $a \\neq 0$.\n\n3.  **Count the number of possible elements.**\n    The matrices in $H$ are uniquely determined by the choice of the entries $a$ and $b$, subject to the constraints we have found:\n    -   $a, b \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$.\n    -   $a \\neq 0$.\n    -   There is no constraint on $b$.\n\n    The field $\\mathbb{F}_p$ has $p$ elements, represented by $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, p-1\\}$.\n    -   The number of choices for the entry $a$: It can be any element of $\\mathbb{F}_p$ except for $0$. So there are $p-1$ possible choices for $a$.\n    -   The number of choices for the entry $b$: It can be any element of $\\mathbb{F}_p$. So there are $p$ possible choices for $b$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total order of H.**\n    The total number of matrices in $H$ is the product of the number of independent choices for each entry.\n    $$ |H| = (\\text{Number of choices for } a) \\times (\\text{Number of choices for } b) $$\n    $$ |H| = (p-1) \\times p $$\n    Thus, the order of the subgroup $H$ is $p(p-1)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{p(p-1)}\n$$", "id": "788417"}, {"introduction": "Building on direct counting, we now investigate a subgroup defined by a geometric property rather than an explicit algebraic form, illustrating the powerful connection between algebra and geometry.
