This approach of identifying an unknown structure with a known one is a fundamental technique in modern algebra.", "problem": "Let $\\mathbb{F}_p$ be the finite field with $p$ elements, where $p$ is a prime number. The affine plane over this field is the set of points $\\mathbb{A}^2(\\mathbb{F}_p) = \\mathbb{F}_p^2$. The affine general linear group $AGL_2(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ consists of all invertible affine transformations of the plane. These are mappings $g: \\mathbb{A}^2(\\mathbb{F}_p) \\to \\mathbb{A}^2(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ of the form $g(x) = Mx + v$, where $M$ is an invertible $2 \\times 2$ matrix with entries in $\\mathbb{F}_p$ (i.e., $M \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{F}_p)$) and $v$ is a vector in $\\mathbb{F}_p^2$. The group operation is the composition of mappings.\n\nThe group $AGL_2(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ acts on the set of points of the affine plane. This action extends to subsets of points. A triangle is defined as a set of three non-collinear points. Consider the standard triangle $T$ defined by the set of vertices $\\{P_0, P_1, P_2\\}$, where $P_0 = (0,0)$, $P_1 = (1,0)$, and $P_2 = (0,1)$. These three points are non-collinear for any prime $p$.\n\nThe stabilizer of the triangle $T$ under this group action, denoted $G_T$, is the subgroup of $AGL_2(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ consisting of all transformations that map the triangle $T$ onto itself, i.e., $G_T = \\{g \\in AGL_2(\\mathbb{F}_p) \\mid g(T) = T\\}$.\n\nDerive the order of the stabilizer group $G_T$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the order of the stabilizer subgroup $G_T$ of the triangle $T = \\{P_0, P_1, P_2\\}$ under the action of the affine group $AGL_2(\\mathbb{F}_p)$. The vertices of the triangle are $P_0 = \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$, $P_1 = \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$, and $P_2 = \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nAn element $g \\in AGL_2(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ is in the stabilizer $G_T$ if it maps the set of vertices $T$ to itself. This means that the action of $g$ on $T$ must permute its vertices. Let's represent an element $g \\in AGL_2(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ by a pair $(M, v)$, where $M \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ and $v \\in \\mathbb{F}_p^2$, such that $g(x) = Mx + v$.\n\nThe condition $g(T) = T$ implies that for each vertex $P_i \\in T$, its image $g(P_i)$ must also be a vertex in $T$. This defines a permutation $\\sigma$ of the indices $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$, such that $g(P_i) = P_{\\sigma(i)}$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. The set of all permutations of three elements is the symmetric group $S_3$.\n\nThis relationship defines a map $\\phi: G_T \\to S_3$, where $\\phi(g) = \\sigma$. We can show this map is a group homomorphism. Let $g_1, g_2 \\in G_T$ correspond to permutations $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2 \\in S_3$. Then $(g_1 \\circ g_2)(P_i) = g_1(g_2(P_i)) = g_1(P_{\\sigma_2(i)}) = P_{\\sigma_1(\\sigma_2(i))} = P_{(\\sigma_1 \\circ \\sigma_2)(i)}$. So $\\phi(g_1 \\circ g_2) = \\sigma_1 \\circ \\sigma_2 = \\phi(g_1) \\circ \\phi(g_2)$, which confirms it's a homomorphism.\n\nTo find the order of $G_T$, we will investigate if this homomorphism is an isomorphism. This requires checking if it is both injective and surjective.\n\n**1. Injectivity of $\\phi$**\n\nThe homomorphism $\\phi$ is injective if its kernel is trivial. The kernel of $\\phi$ consists of elements $g \\in G_T$ that map to the identity permutation, i.e., $g(P_i) = P_i$ for all $i=0, 1, 2$.\n\nLet $g=(M,v)$ be in $\\ker(\\phi)$. The conditions are:\n1.  $g(P_0) = P_0 \\implies M P_0 + v = P_0 \\implies M\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix} + v = \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix} \\implies v = \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$.\n2.  $g(P_1) = P_1 \\implies M P_1 + v = P_1 \\implies M\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$. Let $M = \\begin{pmatrix}a & b \\\\ c & d\\end{pmatrix}$. This gives $\\begin{pmatrix}a\\\\c\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$, so $a=1, c=0$.\n3.  $g(P_2) = P_2 \\implies M P_2 + v = P_2 \\implies M\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\0\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$. This gives $\\begin{pmatrix}b\\\\d\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$, so $b=0, d=1$.\n\nSo, $M$ must be the identity matrix $I = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}$, and $v$ must be the zero vector. The only element in $\\ker(\\phi)$ is $(I, 0)$, which is the identity element of $AGL_2(\\mathbb{F}_p)$. Thus, the kernel is trivial, and $\\phi$ is injective. This means $G_T$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_3$.\n\n**2. Surjectivity of $\\phi$**\n\nThe homomorphism $\\phi$ is surjective if for every permutation $\\sigma \\in S_3$, there exists an affine transformation $g = (M,v)$ such that $g(P_i) = P_{\\sigma(i)}$ for $i=0, 1, 2$.\n\nLet's try to construct such a $g$ for an arbitrary $\\sigma \\in S_3$. The conditions are:\n1.  $g(P_0) = P_{\\sigma(0)} \\implies M P_0 + v = P_{\\sigma(0)} \\implies v = P_{\\sigma(0)}$.\n2.  $g(P_1) = P_{\\sigma(1)} \\implies M P_1 + v = P_{\\sigma(1)} \\implies M P_1 = P_{\\sigma(1)} - v = P_{\\sigma(1)} - P_{\\sigma(0)}$.\n3.  $g(P_2) = P_{\\sigma(2)} \\implies M P_2 + v = P_{\\sigma(2)} \\implies M P_2 = P_{\\sigma(2)} - v = P_{\\sigma(2)} - P_{\\sigma(0)}$.\n\nRecalling that $P_1 = \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix} = e_1$ and $P_2 = \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix} = e_2$, the second and third conditions determine the columns of the matrix $M$:\nThe first column of $M$ is $Me_1 = P_{\\sigma(1)} - P_{\\sigma(0)}$.\nThe second column of $M$ is $Me_2 = P_{\\sigma(2)} - P_{\\sigma(0)}$.\n\nSo, $M$ is uniquely determined by $\\sigma$:\n$$M = \\begin{pmatrix} P_{\\sigma(1)} - P_{\\sigma(0)} & | & P_{\\sigma(2)} - P_{\\sigma(0)} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nFor $g=(M,v)$ to be a valid element of $AGL_2(\\mathbb{F}_p)$, the matrix $M$ must be invertible, i.e., $M \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{F}_p)$. This is equivalent to its columns being linearly independent. The columns are the vectors pointing from vertex $P_{\\sigma(0)}$ to the other two vertices, $P_{\\sigma(1)}$ and $P_{\\sigma(2)}$.\n\nSince the points $P_0, P_1, P_2$ are non-collinear, any set of three distinct points from $T$ is non-collinear. Let $\\{i,j,k\\} = \\{\\sigma(0), \\sigma(1), \\sigma(2)\\}$. The vectors $P_j - P_i$ and $P_k - P_i$ are linearly independent if and only if $P_i, P_j, P_k$ are non-collinear. The determinant of $M$ is given by $\\det(P_j-P_i, P_k-P_i)$, which is non-zero.\n\nLet's check this explicitly for our points. A permutation of $\\{P_0,P_1,P_2\\}$ is used. Let the vertices be denoted by their indices.\nLet's choose $\\sigma(0)=0$, $\\sigma(1)=1$, $\\sigma(2)=2$ (the identity). $v=P_0=(0,0)$. $M e_1 = P_1 - P_0 = (1,0)^T$, $M e_2 = P_2 - P_0 = (0,1)^T$. $M=I$, $\\det(M)=1$.\nLet's choose $\\sigma(0)=1$, $\\sigma(1)=2$, $\\sigma(2)=0$. $v=P_1=(1,0)^T$. $M e_1 = P_2 - P_1 = (-1,1)^T$, $M e_2 = P_0 - P_1 = (-1,0)^T$. $M=\\begin{pmatrix}-1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}$, $\\det(M)=1$.\nLet's choose $\\sigma(0)=0$, $\\sigma(1)=2$, $\\sigma(2)=1$. $v=P_0=(0,0)^T$. $M e_1 = P_2 - P_0 = (0,1)^T$, $M e_2 = P_1 - P_0 = (1,0)^T$. $M=\\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}$, $\\det(M)=-1$.\n\nIn general, the determinant of $M$ will be the determinant of a matrix whose columns are vectors of the form $P_k - P_j$. The vectors representing the sides of the triangle $T$ are $P_1-P_0 = (1,0)$, $P_2-P_0 = (0,1)$, and $P_2-P_1 = (-1,1)$. Any pair of these (originating from the same vertex) will have determinant $\\pm 1$. This value is non-zero in any field $\\mathbb{F}_p$.\nFor every permutation $\\sigma \\in S_3$, we found a unique element $g=(M,v) \\in AGL_2(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ that realizes it. Therefore, the map $\\phi$ is surjective.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSince the homomorphism $\\phi: G_T \\to S_3$ is both injective and surjective, it is an isomorphism. This means the stabilizer group $G_T$ is isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_3$.\n$$G_T \\cong S_3$$\nThe order of the group $G_T$ is therefore the same as the order of $S_3$.\n$$|G_T| = |S_3| = 3! = 6$$\nThe result is independent of the prime $p$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{6}\n$$", "id": "729492"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice explores a more abstract but profoundly important action: a group acting on its own set of subgroups via conjugation.
