The initial condition is a deterministic value $x_0 \\in (0, \\infty)$.\n\nFirst, we address the tasks as outlined in the problem statement.\n\n**Properties of the Coefficients**\n\nWe verify that the coefficients $b(x) = x^{2}$ and $\\sigma(x) = 0$ are locally Lipschitz on $\\mathbb{R}$ and that the linear growth condition fails for $b(x)$.\n\n1.  **Local Lipschitz Continuity:** A function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is locally Lipschitz if for every compact set $K \\subset \\mathbb{R}$, there exists a constant $L_K > 0$ such that $|f(x) - f(y)| \\le L_K |x - y|$ for all $x, y \\in K$.\n    *   For the diffusion coefficient $\\sigma(x) = 0$, we have $|\\sigma(x) - \\sigma(y)| = |0 - 0| = 0$. This trivially satisfies the Lipschitz condition for any $L_K \\ge 0$ on any set, so $\\sigma$ is globally Lipschitz.\n    *   For the drift coefficient $b(x) = x^{2}$, let $K$ be any compact subset of $\\mathbb{R}$. Being compact, $K$ is bounded, so there exists a constant $M > 0$ such that $K \\subseteq [-M, M]$. For any $x, y \\in K$, we have $|x| \\le M$ and $|y| \\le M$. Consider the difference:\n        $$\n        |b(x) - b(y)| = |x^2 - y^2| = |(x-y)(x+y)| = |x-y||x+y|\n        $$\n        Using the triangle inequality, $|x+y| \\le |x| + |y| \\le M + M = 2M$. Therefore,\n        $$\n        |b(x) - b(y)| \\le (2M)|x-y|\n        $$\n        Choosing $L_K = 2M$, we have demonstrated that $b(x) = x^2$ is Lipschitz continuous on any compact set $K$. Thus, $b$ is locally Lipschitz.\n\n2.  **Linear Growth Condition:** A function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfies the linear growth condition if there exists a constant $C > 0$ such that $|f(x)| \\le C(1 + |x|)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   For $b(x) = x^{2}$, we have $|b(x)| = x^2$. We must check if there exists a constant $C$ such that $x^2 \\le C(1+|x|)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   Consider the ratio $\\frac{|b(x)|}{1+|x|} = \\frac{x^2}{1+|x|}$. As $|x| \\to \\infty$, this ratio behaves like $\\frac{x^2}{|x|} = |x|$.\n    *   Specifically, $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{x^2}{1+x} = \\infty$.\n    *   Since this ratio is unbounded, there is no constant $C$ that can satisfy the inequality for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, the linear growth condition fails for the drift coefficient $b(x)$.\n\n**Strong Existence and Solution**\n\nSince the diffusion coefficient $\\sigma(x)$ is identically zero, the SDE degenerates into an ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\ndX_t = X_t^2 \\, dt, \\qquad X_0 = x_0\n$$\nSince $x_0 > 0$, the solution $X_t$ will be positive for as long as it exists, as $dX_t/dt = X_t^2 > 0$. We can solve this ODE using separation of variables for $X_t > 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{dX_t}{X_t^2} = dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from time $0$ to a generic time $t$, we get:\n$$\n\\int_{X_0}^{X_t} \\frac{1}{u^2} \\, du = \\int_0^t 1 \\, ds\n$$\nThe evaluation of the integrals yields:\n$$\n\\left[ -\\frac{1}{u} \\right]_{x_0}^{X_t} = [s]_0^t\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{X_t} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{x_0}\\right) = t - 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x_0} - \\frac{1}{X_t} = t\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $X_t$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{X_t} = \\frac{1}{x_0} - t = \\frac{1 - t x_0}{x_0}\n$$\n$$\nX_t = \\frac{x_0}{1 - t x_0}\n$$\nThis is an explicit formula for the solution. Since this solution is a deterministic function of time $t$ and the initial condition $x_0$, it is adapted to any filtration, including the one generated by the Brownian motion $W_t$. Thus, this constitutes a strong solution.\n\nThe solution is defined for $t$ such that $1 - t x_0 \\ne 0$. Since we are given $x_0 > 0$, the solution starts at $X_0=x_0$ and increases. The denominator $1 - t x_0$ becomes zero at $t = 1/x_0$. As $t$ approaches $1/x_0$ from below, $X_t \\to +\\infty$. This phenomenon is known as finite-time blow-up or explosion.\n\nThe explosion time, denoted $\\tau_{e}(x_0)$, is the first time the solution leaves every compact subset of $\\mathbb{R}$. Based on the explicit solution, this occurs precisely at the time of the vertical asymptote.\n$$\n\\tau_{e}(x_0) = \\inf\\{t > 0 : |X_t| = \\infty\\} = \\frac{1}{x_0}\n$$\nThe unique maximal strong solution exists on the time interval $[0, \\tau_{e}(x_0))$.\n\n**Pathwise Uniqueness up to Explosion Time**\n\nThe standard theorem for existence and uniqueness of strong solutions to SDEs requires the coefficients to be globally Lipschitz and satisfy a linear growth condition to guarantee global existence and uniqueness. Here, these conditions fail. However, a more general theorem states that if the coefficients are locally Lipschitz, then for any initial condition, there exists a unique strong solution up to a random explosion time $\\tau_e$. We will justify this for our specific case.\n\nLet $X_t$ and $Y_t$ be two strong solutions to the SDE with the same initial condition $X_0 = Y_0 = x_0$. Let $\\tau_e^X$ and $\\tau_e^Y$ be their respective explosion times. We want to show that $X_t = Y_t$ for all $t < \\tau_e^X \\wedge \\tau_e^Y$.\n\nLet $n$ be an integer such that $n > |x_0|$. Define a sequence of stopping times:\n$$\nT_n = \\inf\\{t \\ge 0 : |X_t| \\ge n \\text{ or } |Y_t| \\ge n\\}\n$$\nFor any time $t < T_n$, both solutions satisfy $|X_t| < n$ and $|Y_t| < n$. On the compact interval $[-n, n]$, the drift coefficient $b(x) = x^2$ is Lipschitz with a constant $L_n = 2n$, as we showed earlier.\n\nConsider the difference process $Z_t = X_t - Y_t$. For $t < T_n$, we have:\n$$\nZ_t = X_t - Y_t = (X_0 - Y_0) + \\int_0^t (b(X_s) - b(Y_s)) \\, ds + \\int_0^t (\\sigma(X_s) - \\sigma(Y_s)) \\, dW_s\n$$\nSince $X_0=Y_0=x_0$ and $\\sigma(x)=0$, this simplifies to:\n$$\nZ_t = \\int_0^t (b(X_s) - b(Y_s)) \\, ds\n$$\nTaking the absolute value for $t \\in [0, T_n)$:\n$$\n|Z_t| = \\left| \\int_0^t (b(X_s) - b(Y_s)) \\, ds \\right| \\le \\int_0^t |b(X_s) - b(Y_s)| \\, ds\n$$\nSince $s < t < T_n$, both $X_s$ and $Y_s$ are in the interval $(-n, n)$, where $b$ is Lipschitz with constant $L_n$:\n$$\n|Z_t| \\le \\int_0^t L_n |X_s - Y_s| \\, ds = \\int_0^t L_n |Z_s| \\, ds\n$$\nThe function $u(t) = |Z_t|$ is non-negative and continuous. By the integral form of Grönwall's inequality, which states that if $u(t) \\le C \\int_0^t u(s) ds$ for a non-negative constant $C$, then $u(t) \\equiv 0$ for all $t \\ge 0$. In our case, this implies $|Z_t| = 0$ for all $t \\in [0, T_n)$. Thus, $X_t = Y_t$ for all $t < T_n$.\n\nThis holds for any integer $n > |x_0|$. The sequence of stopping times $T_n$ is non-decreasing as $n \\to \\infty$. Let $T_\\infty = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} T_n$. By definition of explosion time, $T_\\infty = \\tau_e^X \\wedge \\tau_e^Y$. Since $X_t = Y_t$ on $[0, T_n)$ for all $n$, it follows that $X_t = Y_t$ for all $t < T_\\infty$. This establishes pathwise uniqueness up to the (possibly common) explosion time. Because the solutions are identical, their sample paths are identical, and hence their explosion times must be equal: $\\tau_e^X = \\tau_e^Y$ almost surely.\n\nTherefore, we have established strong existence and pathwise uniqueness for the solution $X_t = \\frac{x_0}{1 - t x_0}$ up to its explosion time $\\tau_e(x_0) = \\frac{1}{x_0}$.\n\nThe final answer required is the expression for the explosion time $\\tau_e(x_0)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{x_0}}\n$$", "id": "2998943"}, {"introduction": "While the previous problem explored the growth of coefficients, this exercise [@problem_id:2998961] investigates their local regularity.
