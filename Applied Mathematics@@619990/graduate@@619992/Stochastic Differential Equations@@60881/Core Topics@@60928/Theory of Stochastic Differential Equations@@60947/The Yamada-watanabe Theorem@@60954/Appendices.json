There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or missing information that would render it invalid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the derivation and analysis.\n\n### Derivation of the Classical Conditions\n\nThe standard proof for strong existence and uniqueness via Picard iteration involves two main parts:\n1.  **Uniqueness and Convergence of Iterates**: Showing that the mapping defined by the right-hand side of the SDE's integral form is a contraction on a suitable space of stochastic processes. This guarantees that if a solution exists, it is unique, and that the Picard sequence $\\{X^{(n)}\\}$ converges to a limit process $X$.\n2.  **Boundedness of Moments**: Ensuring that the solution process $X$ does not \"explode\" in finite time. This is typically done by showing that the moments of the Picard iterates, e.g., $\\mathbb{E}\\big[\\sup_{t \\in [0,T]}\\|X^{(n)}_t\\|^2\\big]$, are uniformly bounded on any finite time interval $[0,T]$.\n\n**Part 1: Uniqueness and Convergence (Contraction Argument)**\n\nLet $X$ and $Y$ be two solutions with the same initial condition $X_0$ and Brownian motion $W$. Their difference is:\n$$\nX_t - Y_t = \\int_0^t \\big(b(X_s) - b(Y_s)\\big)\\,ds + \\int_0^t \\big(\\sigma(X_s) - \\sigma(Y_s)\\big)\\,dW_s\n$$\nTaking the expectation of the squared norm and applying the inequality $(a+b)^2 \\le 2a^2 + 2b^2$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\big[\\|X_t - Y_t\\|^2\\big] \\le 2\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left\\|\\int_0^t \\big(b(X_s) - b(Y_s)\\big)\\,ds\\right\\|^2\\right] + 2\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left\\|\\int_0^t \\big(\\sigma(X_s) - \\sigma(Y_s)\\big)\\,dW_s\\right\\|^2\\right]\n$$\nUsing the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for the drift term and Itô's isometry for the diffusion term:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\big[\\|X_t - Y_t\\|^2\\big] \\le 2T\\int_0^t \\mathbb{E}\\big[\\|b(X_s) - b(Y_s)\\|^2\\big]\\,ds + 2\\int_0^t \\mathbb{E}\\big[\\|\\sigma(X_s) - \\sigma(Y_s)\\|_{\\mathrm{HS}}^2\\big]\\,ds\n$$\nTo proceed, we must control the terms $\\|b(X_s) - b(Y_s)\\|$ and $\\|\\sigma(X_s) - \\sigma(Y_s)\\|_{\\mathrm{HS}}$. The classical assumption is that both $b$ and $\\sigma$ are **globally Lipschitz continuous**. That is, there exists a constant $L>0$ such that for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$:\n$$\n\\|b(x)-b(y)\\| \\le L\\|x-y\\| \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\|\\sigma(x)-\\sigma(y)\\|_{\\mathrm{HS}} \\le L\\|x-y\\|\n$$\nApplying these conditions:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\big[\\|X_t - Y_t\\|^2\\big] \\le 2T\\int_0^t L^2\\mathbb{E}\\big[\\|X_s - Y_s\\|^2\\big]\\,ds + 2\\int_0^t L^2\\mathbb{E}\\big[\\|X_s - Y_s\\|^2\\big]\\,ds\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\big[\\|X_t - Y_t\\|^2\\big] \\le 2L^2(T+1)\\int_0^t \\mathbb{E}\\big[\\|X_s - Y_s\\|^2\\big]\\,ds\n$$\nLet $\\phi(t) = \\mathbb{E}\\big[\\|X_t - Y_t\\|^2\\big]$. We have $\\phi(t) \\le C \\int_0^t \\phi(s)\\,ds$ for some constant $C$. Since $\\phi(0) = \\mathbb{E}\\big[\\|X_0 - Y_0\\|^2\\big] = 0$, Gronwall's inequality implies $\\phi(t) = 0$ for all $t \\ge 0$. A similar argument using the BDG inequality shows pathwise uniqueness. The same logic proves that the sequence of Picard iterates is a Cauchy sequence, thus ensuring convergence.\n\n**Part 2: Boundedness of Moments (Non-Explosion)**\n\nTo ensure the integrals in the Picard scheme are well-defined and that the solution exists for all time, we must control the growth of the solution's moments. Let's analyze $\\mathbb{E}\\big[\\|X_t\\|^2\\big]$ for a solution $X_t$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\big[\\|X_t\\|^2\\big] \\le 3\\mathbb{E}\\big[\\|X_0\\|^2\\big] + 3T\\int_0^t \\mathbb{E}\\big[\\|b(X_s)\\|^2\\big]\\,ds + 3\\int_0^t \\mathbb{E}\\big[\\|\\sigma(X_s)\\|_{\\mathrm{HS}}^2\\big]\\,ds\n$$\nTo control the integral terms, we need to bound $\\|b(x)\\|^2$ and $\\|\\sigma(x)\\|_{\\mathrm{HS}}^2$. The classical condition is **linear growth**: there exists a constant $K>0$ such that for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$:\n$$\n\\|b(x)\\|^2 + \\|\\sigma(x)\\|_{\\mathrm{HS}}^2 \\le K(1+\\|x\\|^2)\n$$\nWith this condition, we get:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\big[\\|X_t\\|^2\\big] \\le 3\\mathbb{E}\\big[\\|X_0\\|^2\\big] + 3(T+1)\\int_0^t \\mathbb{E}\\big[K(1+\\|X_s\\|^2)\\big]\\,ds\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\big[\\|X_t\\|^2\\big] \\le 3\\mathbb{E}\\big[\\|X_0\\|^2\\big] + 3K(T+1)t + 3K(T+1)\\int_0^t \\mathbb{E}\\big[\\|X_s\\|^2\\big]\\,ds\n$$\nLet $\\psi(t) = \\mathbb{E}\\big[\\|X_t\\|^2\\big]$. Then $\\psi(t) \\le A + B\\int_0^t \\psi(s)\\,ds$, where $A$ and $B$ are constants depending on $T, K,$ and $\\mathbb{E}\\big[\\|X_0\\|^2\\big]$. Gronwall's inequality implies that $\\psi(t)$ is bounded on any finite interval $[0,T]$. This ensures the solution does not explode in finite time.\n\nThe combination of global Lipschitz and linear growth conditions is the classical set of sufficient conditions for strong existence and uniqueness. Note that the global Lipschitz condition implies the linear growth condition, as for any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$:\n$\\|b(x)\\| \\le \\|b(x)-b(0)\\| + \\|b(0)\\| \\le L\\|x\\| + \\|b(0)\\|$, so $\\|b(x)\\|^2 \\le 2(L^2\\|x\\|^2 + \\|b(0)\\|^2) \\le C(1+\\|x\\|^2)$ for some constant $C$. A similar argument holds for $\\sigma$. Nonetheless, the two conditions are classically stated together.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. There exist constants $L>0$ and $K>0$ such that, for all $x,y\\in\\mathbb{R}^d$, $\\|b(x)-b(y)\\|\\le L\\|x-y\\|$, $\\|\\sigma(x)-\\sigma(y)\\|_{\\mathrm{HS}}\\le L\\|x-y\\|$, and $\\|b(x)\\|^2 + \\|\\sigma(x)\\|_{\\mathrm{HS}}^2 \\le K\\big(1+\\|x\\|^2\\big)$.**\n    This option states the global Lipschitz condition for both $b$ and $\\sigma$, and the linear growth condition. As derived above, these are precisely the classical conditions used in the standard Picard iteration proof to establish strong existence and pathwise uniqueness.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. The function $b$ is globally Lipschitz on $\\mathbb{R}^d$, the function $\\sigma$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}^d$, and there exists $K>0$ such that $\\|b(x)\\|^2 + \\|\\sigma(x)\\|_{\\mathrm{HS}}^2 \\le K\\big(1+\\|x\\|^2\\big)$.**\n    This option weakens the condition on $\\sigma$ from Lipschitz to merely continuous. The contraction argument used in the Picard iteration method fundamentally relies on the Lipschitz property of $\\sigma$ to control the stochastic integral term. Mere continuity is insufficient to guarantee pathwise uniqueness or the convergence of the Picard iterates. A famous counterexample is the Tanaka SDE, $dX_t = \\operatorname{sgn}(X_t)dW_t$, where $\\sigma$ is not continuous at $0$, but even with a continuous, non-Lipschitz $\\sigma$, uniqueness can fail.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. In dimension $d=1$, there exists $L>0$ such that $(x-y)\\big(b(x)-b(y)\\big)\\le L|x-y|^2$, and $\\sigma$ is Hölder continuous of order $1/2$ with linear growth.**\n    This option presents conditions that are weaker than the classical Lipschitz conditions. The one-sided Lipschitz condition on $b$ and Hölder continuity on $\\sigma$ are used in more advanced theorems to prove pathwise uniqueness, often in concert with the Yamada-Watanabe theorem (which states that weak existence + pathwise uniqueness implies strong existence). However, these are not the conditions used in the *classical Picard iteration* scheme, which hinges on a contraction mapping argument enabled by the stronger Lipschitz assumption.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. There exist constants $L>0$ and $K>0$ such that, for all $x,y\\in\\mathbb{R}^d$, $\\|b(x)-b(y)\\|\\le L\\|x-y\\|$, $\\|\\sigma(x)-\\sigma(y)\\|_{\\mathrm{HS}}\\le L\\|x-y\\|$, and $\\|b(x)\\|^2 + \\|\\sigma(x)\\|_{\\mathrm{HS}}^2 \\le K\\big(1+\\|x\\|^4\\big)$.**\n    This option includes the correct Lipschitz conditions but specifies a superlinear growth condition of order $\\|x\\|^4$. As shown in the derivation for moment bounds, a linear growth condition ($\\|x\\|^2$) is required to use Gronwall's inequality to show that moments are finite on any interval $[0,T]$. A superlinear growth condition like this one does not guarantee that the solution will not explode in finite time. The problem asks for conditions ensuring existence for all finite horizons, which this condition fails to do.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nIn summary, Option A is the only one that correctly identifies the standard, classical set of sufficient conditions for proving strong existence and pathwise uniqueness for all time using the Picard iteration method.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3004620"}, {"introduction": "Having reviewed the classical framework, we now confront a scenario where it breaks down: the Tanaka SDE, where the diffusion coefficient is not Lipschitz.

All givens are clearly defined, scientifically sound, and internally consistent. The problem is a non-trivial application of fundamental concepts such as the Skorokhod problem, semimartingale local time, the product rule, and Lévy's characterization of Brownian motion. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is provided below.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, we must show that the constructed process $(X_t, W_t)$ is a weak solution to the Tanaka SDE. Second, we must compute the characteristic function of $X_t$.\n\n**Part 1: Verification of the Weak Solution**\n\nWe are given the candidate solution $X_t = U_t R_t$, where $R_t$ is the reflecting Brownian motion (RBM) solving the Skorokhod problem $R_t = W_t + L_t^0(R)$, and $U_t$ is a predictable sign process constructed from the excursions of $R_t$ and an independent Rademacher sequence $\\{\\varepsilon_k\\}_{k\\ge 1}$. We start with $X_0 = U_0 R_0$. Since $R_0 = W_0 + L_0^0(R) = 0+0=0$, we have $X_0 = 0$, which matches the initial condition of the SDE.\n\nTo find the dynamics of $X_t$, we apply the product rule for semimartingales (integration by parts formula) to $X_t = U_t R_t$. The general formula is:\n$$\nd(U_t R_t) = U_{t-} dR_t + R_{t-} dU_t + d[U, R]_t\n$$\nIn integral form, this is:\n$$\nX_t = X_0 + \\int_0^t U_{s-} dR_s + \\int_0^t R_{s-} dU_s + [U, R]_t\n$$\nWe analyze each term on the right-hand side.\nSince $X_0=0$:\n$$\nX_t = \\int_0^t U_{s-} dR_s + \\int_0^t R_{s-} dU_s + [U, R]_t\n$$\n1.  The term $\\int_0^t U_{s-} dR_s$:\n    We substitute $dR_s = dW_s + dL_s^0(R)$ from the definition of the RBM:\n    $$\n    \\int_0^t U_{s-} dR_s = \\int_0^t U_{s-} dW_s + \\int_0^t U_{s-} dL_s^0(R)\n    $$\n    The process $U_s$ is predictable, which means $U_{s-} = U_s$ almost everywhere with respect to the Lebesgue measure, allowing us to write the stochastic integral as $\\int_0^t U_s dW_s$. The second integral is a Stieltjes integral with respect to the local time $L_s^0(R)$. The process $L_s^0(R)$ is continuous and non-decreasing, and it increases only on the set of times $\\{s \\ge 0 : R_s = 0\\}$. By construction, the process $U_s$ is defined to be $0$ on this very set. Therefore, the integrand $U_s$ is zero whenever $dL_s^0(R)$ is non-zero. This implies $\\int_0^t U_s dL_s^0(R) = 0$.\n    Thus, the first term simplifies to $\\int_0^t U_s dW_s$.\n\n2.  The term $\\int_0^t R_{s-} dU_s$:\n    The process $U_t$ is a pure jump process. It is constant on the excursion intervals $I_k=(g_k, d_k)$ and on the zero set of $R$. Its jumps occur at the start times $g_k$ of the excursions, where $U_t$ jumps from $0$ to $\\varepsilon_k$. At these times $g_k$, the process $R_t$ is at $0$, so $R_{g_k} = R_{g_k-}=0$ due to the continuity of $R$. The integral is the sum of the jumps of $U$ scaled by the value of $R$ just before the jump: $\\int_0^t R_{s-} dU_s = \\sum_{s \\le t} R_{s-} \\Delta U_s$. As all jumps $\\Delta U_s$ occur at times when $R_{s-}=0$, this sum is zero.\n\n3.  The term $[U, R]_t$:\n    The quadratic covariation between a pure jump process $U$ and a continuous process $R$ is given by $[U, R]_t = \\sum_{s \\le t} \\Delta U_s \\Delta R_s$. Since $R_t$ is a continuous process, its jumps are $\\Delta R_s = 0$ for all $s$. Therefore, $[U, R]_t = 0$.\n\nCombining these results, we find that the dynamics of $X_t$ are given by:\n$$\nX_t = \\int_0^t U_s dW_s\n$$\nThe final step is to show that $U_s = \\operatorname{sgn}(X_s)$. We examine this equality based on the value of $R_s$:\n-   If $R_s > 0$, then $s$ must belong to some excursion interval $I_k$. On this interval, $U_s = \\varepsilon_k$, where $\\varepsilon_k \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$.\n    - If $U_s = 1$, then $X_s = 1 \\cdot R_s = R_s > 0$, so $\\operatorname{sgn}(X_s) = 1$. Thus $U_s = \\operatorname{sgn}(X_s)$.\n    - If $U_s = -1$, then $X_s = -1 \\cdot R_s = -R_s < 0$, so $\\operatorname{sgn}(X_s) = -1$. Thus $U_s = \\operatorname{sgn}(X_s)$.\n-   If $R_s = 0$, then $X_s = U_s R_s = U_s \\cdot 0 = 0$. By the problem's convention, $\\operatorname{sgn}(X_s) = \\operatorname{sgn}(0) = 0$. By construction, $U_s=0$ when $R_s=0$. Thus $U_s = \\operatorname{sgn}(X_s)$.\n\nIn all cases, we have $U_s = \\operatorname{sgn}(X_s)$ for all $s \\ge 0$. Substituting this into the integral expression for $X_t$, we get:\n$$\nX_t = \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(X_s) dW_s\n$$\nThis is the integral form of the Tanaka SDE. The constructed pair $(X_t, W_t)$ solves the equation. Since the process $X_t$ is adapted not to the filtration of $W_t$ alone but to an enlarged filtration that includes the information from the Rademacher variables, this is a weak solution.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Characteristic Function**\n\nWe wish to compute $\\varphi_t(u) = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(iu X_t)]$. Using the construction $X_t = U_t R_t$, we have:\n$$\n\\varphi_t(u) = \\mathbb{E}\\big[ \\exp(iu U_t R_t) \\big]\n$$\nWe use the law of total expectation by conditioning on the Brownian motion $W$, which also determines the process $R$. The Rademacher sequence $\\{\\varepsilon_k\\}$ is independent of $W$. Let $\\mathcal{F}^W = \\sigma(\\{W_s : s \\ge 0\\})$.\n$$\n\\varphi_t(u) = \\mathbb{E}\\Big[ \\mathbb{E}\\big[ \\exp(iu U_t R_t) \\big| \\mathcal{F}^W \\big] \\Big]\n$$\nGiven a realization of $W$, the process $R_t$ and its excursion intervals are fixed.\n-   If, at time $t$, $R_t = 0$, then $X_t=0$ and $\\exp(iu U_t R_t) = 1$. In this case, $\\cos(u R_t) = \\cos(0) = 1$.\n-   If, at time $t$, $R_t > 0$, then $t$ belongs to some excursion interval $I_k$. On this interval, $U_t = \\varepsilon_k$. Since $\\varepsilon_k$ is a Rademacher random variable independent of $\\mathcal{F}^W$, the conditional expectation is:\n    $$\n    \\mathbb{E}\\big[ \\exp(iu \\varepsilon_k R_t) \\big| \\mathcal{F}^W \\big] = \\frac{1}{2} \\exp(iu R_t) + \\frac{1}{2} \\exp(-iu R_t) = \\cos(u R_t)\n    $$\nCombining both cases, the conditional expectation is always $\\cos(u R_t)$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\big[ \\exp(iu U_t R_t) \\big| \\mathcal{F}^W \\big] = \\cos(u R_t)\n$$\nTaking the outer expectation, we get:\n$$\n\\varphi_t(u) = \\mathbb{E}\\big[ \\cos(u R_t) \\big]\n$$\nThe next step is to determine the law of $R_t$. The process $R_t$ is a reflecting Brownian motion starting at $0$. It is a standard result, derivable from the Itô-Tanaka formula and Lévy's characterization of Brownian motion, that the law of $R_t$ is the same as the law of $|B_t|$ for a standard Brownian motion $B_t$. Specifically, applying the Itô-Tanaka formula to $|B_t|$ yields $|B_t| = \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(B_s)dB_s + L^0_t(B)$. The stochastic integral term is a Brownian motion by Lévy's characterization, and $L^0_t(B) = L^0_t(|B|)$, so $|B_t|$ is a solution to the Skorokhod problem. Thus, $\\text{Law}(R_t) = \\text{Law}(|W_t|)$.\n\nOur task reduces to computing $\\mathbb{E}[\\cos(u|W_t|)]$, where $W_t \\sim N(0, t)$.\nThe probability density function of $W_t$ is $f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2t}\\right)$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\cos(u|W_t|)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\cos(u|x|) \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2t}\\right) dx\n$$\nSince the cosine function is even, $\\cos(u|x|) = \\cos(ux)$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\cos(u|W_t|)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\cos(ux) \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2t}\\right) dx = \\mathbb{E}[\\cos(uW_t)]\n$$\nThis is the real part of the characteristic function of the random variable $W_t \\sim N(0,t)$. The characteristic function of a general normal random variable $Y \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ is $\\phi_Y(\\xi) = \\exp(i\\mu\\xi - \\sigma^2 \\xi^2/2)$. For $W_t$, we have $\\mu=0$ and $\\sigma^2=t$.

The SDE is known as Tanaka's SDE, a canonical example used to illustrate the distinctions between weak and strong solutions and different types of uniqueness. The drift coefficient is $b(x)=0$ and the diffusion coefficient is $\\sigma(x)=\\operatorname{sgn}(x)$. The function $\\sigma(x)$ is bounded but discontinuous at $x=0$. The initial condition $X_0=0$ places the process at the point of discontinuity, which is the central feature of the problem. All terms are mathematically precise. The problem is scientifically grounded, objective, and well-posed. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Analysis of the SDE**\n\nThe SDE is $\\mathrm{d}X_t = \\sigma(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$ with $\\sigma(x) = \\operatorname{sgn}(x)$. The standard theorems for existence and uniqueness of strong solutions require the coefficient $\\sigma(x)$ to be locally Lipschitz continuous. Here, $\\sigma(x)$ is not even continuous at $x=0$, so these theorems do not apply and we must investigate using more fundamental principles.\n\n**Option A: There exists a weak solution to the SDE with $X_0=0$, and uniqueness in law (weak uniqueness) holds.**\n\nA weak solution is a pair of processes $(X, W)$ on some filtered probability space $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, (\\mathcal{F}_t), P)$ such that $W$ is an $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$-Brownian motion, $X$ is $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$-adapted, and the SDE is satisfied. The law of the process $X$ must match the initial condition.\n\n*   **Existence of a weak solution:** Let $B_t$ be a standard Brownian motion on some probability space, with $B_0=0$. Define a process $W_t$ by the Itô integral $W_t = \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(B_s)\\,\\mathrm{d}B_s$. The quadratic variation of $W_t$ is $\\langle W \\rangle_t = \\int_0^t (\\operatorname{sgn}(B_s))^2\\,\\mathrm{d}\\langle B \\rangle_s = \\int_0^t (\\operatorname{sgn}(B_s))^2\\,\\mathrm{d}s$. A standard one-dimensional Brownian motion spends a set of time of Lebesgue measure zero at any single point, so the set $\\{s \\ge 0 : B_s=0\\}$ has measure zero almost surely. Thus, $(\\operatorname{sgn}(B_s))^2 = 1$ for almost every $s$. This gives $\\langle W \\rangle_t = \\int_0^t 1\\,\\mathrm{d}s = t$. By Lévy's characterization theorem, since $W_t$ is a continuous local martingale with $W_0=0$ and quadratic variation $\\langle W \\rangle_t=t$, $W_t$ is a standard Brownian motion.\n    From the definition of $W_t$, we have $\\mathrm{d}W_t = \\operatorname{sgn}(B_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}B_t$. Since $\\operatorname{sgn}(x)^2 = 1$ for $x \\neq 0$, we can invert this relationship to get $\\mathrm{d}B_t = \\operatorname{sgn}(B_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$.\n    If we set $X_t = B_t$, then $X_0 = B_0 = 0$ and $\\mathrm{d}X_t = \\operatorname{sgn}(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$. Thus, the pair $(X_t, W_t) = (B_t, \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(B_s)\\,\\mathrm{d}B_s)$ constitutes a weak solution.\n\n*   **Uniqueness in law (weak uniqueness):** Let $(X_t, W_t)$ be any weak solution to the SDE. Since the drift coefficient is zero, $X_t$ is a continuous local martingale. Its quadratic variation is given by $\\mathrm{d}\\langle X \\rangle_t = (\\operatorname{sgn}(X_t))^2 \\mathrm{d}\\langle W \\rangle_t = (\\operatorname{sgn}(X_t))^2 \\mathrm{d}t$. A non-trivial solution to this SDE cannot be identically zero, and as a continuous martingale, the set of times $\\{t : X_t=0\\}$ has Lebesgue measure zero almost surely. Therefore, $(\\operatorname{sgn}(X_t))^2=1$ for almost every $t$, which implies $\\langle X \\rangle_t = t$. A continuous local martingale $X_t$ with $X_0=0$ and $\\langle X \\rangle_t = t$ is, by Lévy's characterization, a standard Brownian motion. This means that any weak solution $X_t$ must have the same law as a standard Brownian motion. Consequently, the law of the solution is unique.\n\nBoth weak existence and uniqueness in law hold.\n**Verdict for A: Correct.**\n\n**Option B: Pathwise uniqueness holds for the SDE with $X_0=0$.**\n\nPathwise uniqueness requires that, on a given probability space with a given Brownian motion $W_t$, there is at most one solution process $X_t$.\nLet's use the construction from A. Let $B_t$ be a standard Brownian motion and define $W_t = \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(B_s)\\,\\mathrm{d}B_s$. We showed that $W_t$ is a standard Brownian motion and that $X_t^{(1)} = B_t$ is a solution to $\\mathrm{d}X_t = \\operatorname{sgn}(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$.\nNow consider the process $X_t^{(2)} = -B_t$. It also starts at $0$. Its differential is $\\mathrm{d}X_t^{(2)} = -\\mathrm{d}B_t$. The right-hand side of the SDE for $X_t^{(2)}$ is $\\operatorname{sgn}(X_t^{(2)})\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t = \\operatorname{sgn}(-B_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t = -\\operatorname{sgn}(B_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$.\nSo, for $X_t^{(2)}$ to be a solution, we must have $-\\mathrm{d}B_t = -\\operatorname{sgn}(B_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$, which simplifies to $\\mathrm{d}B_t = \\operatorname{sgn}(B_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$. This is precisely the relationship we used to define $W_t$.\nTherefore, for this specific Brownian motion $W_t$, both $X_t^{(1)} = B_t$ and $X_t^{(2)} = -B_t$ are solutions. Since $P(B_t = -B_t \\text{ for any } t>0) = P(B_t=0 \\text{ for any } t>0) = 0$, the two solutions are distinct with probability $1$. The existence of two distinct solutions for the same driving Brownian motion demonstrates that pathwise uniqueness fails.\n**Verdict for B: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option C: There exists a strong solution adapted to the filtration generated by $W$.**\n\nA strong solution is a process $X_t$ adapted to the filtration $\\mathcal{F}_t^W$ generated by the given Brownian motion $W_t$. If a strong solution $X_t$ exists, it must satisfy two conditions: (1) $X_t$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t^W$-adapted for all $t \\ge 0$; (2) the SDE holds.\nFrom the analysis in A, any solution must have the law of a Brownian motion. Let's assume a strong solution $X_t$ exists. Then $X_t$ must be an $\\mathcal{F}_t^W$-adapted Brownian motion. The SDE implies $X_t = \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(X_s) \\, \\mathrm{d}W_s$. This implies that the filtration generated by $X$, $\\mathcal{F}_t^X$, is a sub-filtration of $\\mathcal{F}_t^W$, i.e., $\\mathcal{F}_t^X \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}_t^W$.\nFrom the SDE, we can also write $\\mathrm{d}W_t = \\operatorname{sgn}(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}X_t$. This means $W_t = \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(X_s)\\,\\mathrm{d}X_s$. Since $\\operatorname{sgn}(X_s)$ is adapted to $\\mathcal{F}_s^X$, the integral defining $W_t$ is adapted to $\\mathcal{F}_t^X$. Thus, $\\mathcal{F}_t^W \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}_t^X$.\nCombining these gives $\\mathcal{F}_t^X = \\mathcal{F}_t^W$.\nNow we use the generalized Itô formula (Tanaka's formula) for $|X_t|$:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}|X_t| = \\operatorname{sgn}(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}X_t + L_t^0(X)\\,\\mathrm{d}t $$\nwhere $L_t^0(X)$ is the local time of $X$ at $0$. Substituting $\\mathrm{d}X_t = \\operatorname{sgn}(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}|X_t| = \\operatorname{sgn}(X_t)(\\operatorname{sgn}(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t) + L_t^0(X)\\,\\mathrm{d}t = (\\operatorname{sgn}(X_t))^2\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t + L_t^0(X)\\,\\mathrm{d}t $$\nAs $(\\operatorname{sgn}(X_t))^2=1$ for a.e. $t$, we get $\\mathrm{d}|X_t| = \\mathrm{d}W_t + L_t^0(X)\\,\\mathrm{d}t$.\nThis implies $W_t = |X_t| - X_0 - \\int_0^t L_s^0(X)\\,\\mathrm{d}s = |X_t| - \\int_0^t L_s^0(X)\\,\\mathrm{d}s$. The local time $L_t^0(X)$ is measurable with respect to the filtration generated by $|X_t|$, which we denote $\\mathcal{F}_t^{|X|}$. Hence, $W_t$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t^{|X|}$-measurable. This implies $\\mathcal{F}_t^W \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}_t^{|X|}$.\nSo we have the chain of inclusions: $\\mathcal{F}_t^X = \\mathcal{F}_t^W \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}_t^{|X|}$.\nHowever, for a Brownian motion $X_t$, knowing its absolute value $|X_t|$ is not enough to determine $X_t$ (we don't know the sign). The filtration $\\mathcal{F}_t^{|X|}$ is strictly smaller than $\\mathcal{F}_t^X$. Thus, $\\mathcal{F}_t^X \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}_t^{|X|}$ is a contradiction.\nTherefore, no strong solution can exist.\n**Verdict for C: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option D: From weak uniqueness and failure of pathwise uniqueness, the Yamada-Watanabe theorem implies that no strong solution exists.**\n\nThe Yamada-Watanabe theorem provides a fundamental link between strong existence, weak existence, and pathwise uniqueness. A key part of the theorem states that for an SDE, the existence of a strong solution implies pathwise uniqueness.\nLet's write this as an implication: (Strong Existence) $\\implies$ (Pathwise Uniqueness).\nThe logically equivalent contrapositive statement is: (NOT Pathwise Uniqueness) $\\implies$ (NOT Strong Existence).\nIn the analysis for option B, we proved that pathwise uniqueness fails for this SDE.\nTherefore, applying the Yamada-Watanabe theorem, we can directly conclude that a strong solution does not exist. The statement correctly attributes this conclusion to the theorem. The premises mentioned in the statement (\"weak uniqueness\" and \"failure of pathwise uniqueness\") are indeed correct properties of this SDE, and the failure of pathwise uniqueness is the crucial premise for this part of the theorem.\n**Verdict for D: Correct.**\n\n**Option E: If instead $X_0=x\\neq 0$, then pathwise uniqueness holds for the same SDE.**\n\nLet's consider the initial condition $X_0 = x_0 \\neq 0$. Without loss of generality, let $x_0 > 0$.\nA solution $X_t$ starting at $x_0$ will remain positive for some interval of time $[0, T_0)$, where $T_0 = \\inf\\{t>0 : X_t=0\\}$ is the first hitting time of the origin.\nFor $t \\in [0, T_0)$, we have $\\operatorname{sgn}(X_t) = 1$, so the SDE simplifies to $\\mathrm{d}X_t = \\mathrm{d}W_t$. The unique solution on this interval is $X_t = x_0 + W_t$. The first hitting time is thus $T_0 = \\inf\\{t>0 : x_0 + W_t = 0\\}$. For a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion, this time is almost surely finite.\nAt time $T_0$, the process reaches the state $X_{T_0} = 0$. For times $t > T_0$, the evolution of the process is governed by the SDE starting from $0$. Let $s = t - T_0$ and define a new process $Y_s = X_{T_0+s}$ and a new Brownian motion $\\tilde{W}_s = W_{T_0+s} - W_{T_0}$. By the strong Markov property of Brownian motion, $\\tilde{W}_s$ is a standard Brownian motion independent of the history up to time $T_0$. The process $Y_s$ must satisfy the SDE:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}Y_s = \\operatorname{sgn}(Y_s)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\tilde{W}_s, \\qquad Y_0=0 $$\nThis is the original problem for which we have already shown in B that pathwise uniqueness fails. The failure of pathwise uniqueness for $Y_s$ implies that for a given path of $\\tilde{W}_s$, there can be multiple solution paths for $Y_s$. This in turn implies that for a given path of the original $W_t$, there can be multiple solution paths for $X_t$ that coincide up to $T_0$ but diverge afterwards.\nSince hitting the origin is an almost sure event, the issue of non-uniqueness is not avoided, merely postponed. Therefore, pathwise uniqueness does not hold for a non-zero initial condition either.\n**Verdict for E: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2998968"}]}
