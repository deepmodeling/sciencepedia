The assumptions on the drift function $b$ and diffusion function $\\sigma$ (twice continuously differentiable with bounded derivatives) are standard conditions that guarantee the existence and uniqueness of a strong solution to the given stochastic differential equation (SDE).\n\nThe problem asks for two main derivations: first, the differential of the quadratic covariation $d\\langle H, W\\rangle_t$ where $H_t = \\sigma(X_t)$, and second, the expression for the Stratonovich drift $b_{\\mathrm{Strat}}(x)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the differential of the quadratic covariation, $d\\langle H, W\\rangle_t$. The process $H_t$ is defined as $H_t = \\sigma(X_t)$, where $X_t$ is an Itô process. To find the SDE for $H_t$, we apply Itô's formula. Let $f(x) = \\sigma(x)$. Since $\\sigma$ is assumed to be twice continuously differentiable ($C^2$), Itô's formula for $H_t = f(X_t)$ is applicable:\n$$\ndH_t = f'(X_t) dX_t + \\frac{1}{2} f''(X_t) d\\langle X \\rangle_t\n$$\nThe SDE for $X_t$ is given as $dX_t = b(X_t) dt + \\sigma(X_t) dW_t$. The quadratic variation of $X_t$ is given by $d\\langle X \\rangle_t = \\sigma(X_t)^2 dt$. Substituting these into the formula for $dH_t$, and using $f'(x) = \\sigma'(x)$ and $f''(x) = \\sigma''(x)$, we get:\n$$\ndH_t = \\sigma'(X_t) \\left( b(X_t) dt + \\sigma(X_t) dW_t \\right) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma''(X_t) \\sigma(X_t)^2 dt\n$$\nWe can separate the drift ($dt$) and diffusion ($dW_t$) terms:\n$$\ndH_t = \\left( b(X_t)\\sigma'(X_t) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma''(X_t)\\sigma(X_t)^2 \\right) dt + \\sigma(X_t)\\sigma'(X_t) dW_t\n$$\nThe quadratic covariation differential between two continuous semimartingales, say $Y_t$ and $Z_t$, with SDEs $dY_t = \\mu_Y dt + \\sigma_Y dW_t$ and $dZ_t = \\mu_Z dt + \\sigma_Z dW_t$, is given by $d\\langle Y, Z \\rangle_t = \\sigma_Y \\sigma_Z dt$.\nIn our case, we need $d\\langle H, W \\rangle_t$. The SDE for $W_t$ is $dW_t = 0 \\cdot dt + 1 \\cdot dW_t$, so its diffusion coefficient is $1$. The diffusion coefficient of $H_t$, from its SDE derived above, is $\\sigma(X_t)\\sigma'(X_t)$.\nTherefore, the differential of the quadratic covariation is:\n$$\nd\\langle H, W \\rangle_t = \\left( \\sigma(X_t)\\sigma'(X_t) \\right) \\cdot (1) \\cdot dt = \\sigma(X_t)\\sigma'(X_t) dt\n$$\n\nSecond, we use this result to rewrite the Itô SDE in Stratonovich form. The relationship between the Stratonovich integral and the Itô integral is given by:\n$$\n\\int_0^t \\sigma(X_s) \\circ dW_s = \\int_0^t \\sigma(X_s) dW_s + \\frac{1}{2} \\langle \\sigma(X), W \\rangle_t\n$$\nHere, $\\langle \\sigma(X), W \\rangle_t$ is precisely the quadratic covariation process $\\langle H, W \\rangle_t$ from the first part.

The problem is a classic example illustrating the distinction between weak and strong solutions to SDEs. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for a multi-part analysis of the stochastic differential equation (SDE) given in integral form by\n$$\nX_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} \\sigma(X_{s}) \\, dW_{s}\n$$\nwhere $X_{0}=0$ and the diffusion coefficient is $\\sigma(x) = \\operatorname{sgn}(x)$.\n\n**Part 1: Analysis of the diffusion coefficient $\\sigma(x)$**\n\nThe diffusion coefficient is defined as\n$$\n\\sigma(x) \\;=\\; \\operatorname{sgn}(x) \\;:=\\; \\begin{cases}\n1, & x \\ge 0,\\\\\n-1, & x<0.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nWe analyze its regularity properties relevant to classical SDE theory.\n\n- **Boundedness**: The function $\\sigma(x)$ takes values only in the set $\\{-1, 1\\}$. Therefore, it is bounded, as $\\lvert\\sigma(x)\\rvert = 1 \\le M$ for any constant $M \\ge 1$ and for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n- **Borel Measurability**: A function is Borel measurable if the preimage of any open set in the codomain is a Borel set in the domain. Consider an arbitrary open set $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$. The preimage $\\sigma^{-1}(A)$ can be one of the following sets: $\\emptyset$, $(-\\infty, 0)$, $[0, \\infty)$, or $\\mathbb{R}$. All of these are Borel sets in $\\mathbb{R}$. For instance, if $1 \\in A$ and $-1 \\notin A$, $\\sigma^{-1}(A) = [0, \\infty)$. If $-1 \\in A$ and $1 \\notin A$, $\\sigma^{-1}(A) = (-\\infty, 0)$. If both $1, -1 \\in A$, $\\sigma^{-1}(A) = \\mathbb{R}$. If neither is in $A$, $\\sigma^{-1}(A) = \\emptyset$. Thus, $\\sigma(x)$ is a Borel measurable function.\n\n- **Continuity**: The function $\\sigma(x)$ is continuous for all $x \\neq 0$. However, at $x=0$, we have the left-hand limit $\\lim_{x \\to 0^{-}} \\sigma(x) = -1$ and the right-hand limit $\\lim_{x \\to 0^{+}} \\sigma(x) = 1$. Since the left and right limits are not equal, the function is not continuous at $x=0$.\n\n- **Lipschitz Continuity**: A function $f(x)$ is globally Lipschitz continuous if there exists a constant $K > 0$ such that $\\lvert f(x) - f(y) \\rvert \\le K \\lvert x-y \\rvert$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Since $\\sigma(x)$ is not continuous, it cannot be globally Lipschitz continuous. It also fails to be locally Lipschitz continuous in any neighborhood of $0$. To see this, consider $x=\\epsilon > 0$ and $y=-\\epsilon  0$. Then $\\lvert\\sigma(x) - \\sigma(y)\\rvert = \\lvert 1 - (-1) \\rvert = 2$. The Lipschitz condition would require $2 \\le K \\lvert x-y \\rvert = K \\lvert 2\\epsilon \\rvert$, or $K \\ge 1/\\epsilon$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the required constant $K$ would have to be unbounded, which violates the definition.\n\nThe classical existence and uniqueness theorem for strong solutions requires the diffusion coefficient to be locally Lipschitz continuous and satisfy a linear growth condition. Since $\\sigma(x)$ is not locally Lipschitz at $x=0$, this theorem cannot be applied to guarantee the existence of a strong solution.\n\n**Part 2: Existence of a weak solution**\n\nA weak solution to the SDE consists of a filtered probability space $(\\tilde{\\Omega},\\tilde{\\mathcal{F}},(\\tilde{\\mathcal{F}}_{t})_{t\\geq 0},\\tilde{\\mathbb{P}})$ and a pair of continuous adapted processes $(\\tilde{X}, \\tilde{W})$ such that $\\tilde{W}$ is an $(\\tilde{\\mathcal{F}}_{t})$-Standard Brownian Motion, $\\tilde{X}_{0}=0$, and the integral equation holds.\n\nThe existence of a weak solution for SDEs with bounded, measurable coefficients is a classical result due to Stroock and Varadhan, established via the martingale problem. The relevant theorem states that for an SDE of the form $dX_t = b(t, X_t)dt + \\sigma(t, X_t)dW_t$, a weak solution exists if the coefficients $b$ and $\\sigma$ are bounded and measurable, and the matrix $a(t,x) = \\sigma(t,x)\\sigma(t,x)^T$ is uniformly elliptic.\nIn our case, the drift coefficient is $b(x)=0$ and the diffusion coefficient is $\\sigma(x) = \\operatorname{sgn}(x)$.\n- As established in Part 1, $\\sigma(x)$ is bounded and Borel measurable.\n- The \"diffusion matrix\" is a $1 \\times 1$ matrix (a scalar) given by $a(x) = \\sigma(x)\\sigma(x)^T = (\\operatorname{sgn}(x))^2 = 1$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n- The uniform ellipticity condition requires that there exists a constant $\\lambda  0$ such that $\\xi^T a(x) \\xi \\ge \\lambda |\\xi|^2$ for all $x, \\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}$. For our one-dimensional case, this simplifies to $a(x) \\ge \\lambda  0$. Since $a(x)=1$, we can choose $\\lambda=1$. The condition is satisfied.\nTherefore, based on the theorem for existence of weak solutions for SDEs with bounded, measurable, and uniformly elliptic diffusion coefficients, a weak solution to the SDE $dX_t = \\operatorname{sgn}(X_t) dW_t$ exists.\n\n**Part 3: Non-existence of a strong solution**\n\nA strong solution is a process $X$ adapted to the filtration generated by the given Brownian motion $W$, which satisfies the SDE. The Yamada-Watanabe theorem states that for an SDE (with weak existence established), the existence of a strong solution is equivalent to pathwise uniqueness. Pathwise uniqueness means that for any given Brownian motion $W$ on a given probability space, any two solutions $X$ and $Y$ starting from the same initial condition must be indistinguishable, i.e., $\\mathbb{P}(X_t=Y_t \\text{ for all } t\\geq 0)=1$.\n\nWe will demonstrate that pathwise uniqueness fails for this SDE.\nLet's assume a strong solution $X = (X_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ exists for a given SBM $W = (W_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ and its natural filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_t^W)_{t \\ge 0}$. So, $X$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t^W$-adapted and satisfies\n$$\nX_t = \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(X_s) dW_s.\n$$\nNow, consider the process $Y_t = -X_t$. The process $Y$ is also continuous, adapted to $\\mathcal{F}_t^W$, and starts at $Y_0=0$. Let's check if $Y$ also solves the SDE. The SDE for $Y$ would be\n$$\nY_t = \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(Y_s) dW_s.\n$$\nLet's evaluate the right-hand side with $Y_s = -X_s$:\n$$\n\\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(-X_s) dW_s = \\int_0^t -\\operatorname{sgn}(X_s) dW_s,\n$$\nwhere the equality $\\operatorname{sgn}(-x) = -\\operatorname{sgn}(x)$ holds for all $x\\neq 0$. As will be shown in Part 4, any solution $X$ is a SBM, so the set of times $\\{s \\ge 0 \\mid X_s=0\\}$ has Lebesgue measure $0$ almost surely. The Itô integral is invariant under changes to the integrand on a set of measure zero, so the equality holds for the integral.\nThe integral becomes\n$$\n-\\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(X_s) dW_s = -X_t = Y_t.\n$$\nThis shows that if $X_t$ is a strong solution, then $Y_t = -X_t$ is also a strong solution for the same Brownian motion $W$.\n\nAs shown in Part 4, any solution $X$ must be a SBM. A SBM is not identically zero (with probability $1$). Thus, $X_t$ and $Y_t = -X_t$ are two distinct processes. This demonstrates the failure of pathwise uniqueness.\nSince pathwise uniqueness fails, the Yamada-Watanabe theorem implies that no strong solution can exist for this SDE.\n\n**Part 4: Quadratic Variation and Characteristic Function**\n\nLet $X = (X_t)_{t\\geq 0}$ be any weak solution to the SDE. By definition, $X$ is a continuous process satisfying $X_t = M_t$ where $M_t = \\int_0^t \\sigma(X_s) dW_s$. This implies $X$ is a continuous local martingale with $X_0=0$.\n\nThe quadratic variation process of $X$, denoted $\\langle X \\rangle_t$, is given by the general formula for Itô integrals:\n$$\n\\langle X \\rangle_t = \\left\\langle \\int_0^\\cdot \\sigma(X_s) dW_s \\right\\rangle_t = \\int_0^t \\sigma(X_s)^2 ds.\n$$\nUsing the definition of our specific $\\sigma(x)$, we find that $\\sigma(x)^2 = (\\operatorname{sgn}(x))^2 = 1$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for the quadratic variation gives:\n$$\n\\langle X \\rangle_t = \\int_0^t 1^2 ds = t.\n$$\nSo, $X$ is a continuous local martingale with $X_0=0$ and quadratic variation $\\langle X \\rangle_t = t$. By Lévy's characterization of Brownian motion, any such process must be a standard Brownian motion (SBM). Therefore, any weak solution $X$ to this SDE has the law of a SBM.\n\nWe are asked to compute the characteristic function of $X_T$ at a fixed time $T0$, which is defined as $\\phi_{X_T}(u) = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(iuX_T)]$. Since the law of the process $X$ is that of a SBM, the random variable $X_T$ is normally distributed with mean $0$ and variance $T$. That is, $X_T \\sim N(0, T)$.\n\nThe characteristic function of a general normal random variable $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ is given by $\\phi_Z(u) = \\exp(iu\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}u^2\\sigma^2)$.\nFor $X_T$, we have mean $\\mu = 0$ and variance $\\sigma^2 = T$. Substituting these values, we get:\n$$\n\\phi_{X_T}(u) = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(iuX_T)] = \\exp\\left(iu(0) - \\frac{1}{2}u^2T\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}Tu^2\\right).\n$$\nThis is the characteristic function of $X_T$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}Tu^{2}\\right)}$$", "id": "2997369"}, {"introduction": "The properties of the coefficients in an SDE's integral form can dramatically influence the long-term behavior of its solution.

This is the SDE for a Bessel process of dimension $\\delta$. We are asked to determine the probability that the process hits the boundary at $0$ starting from an initial state $x_0  0$.\n\nThe hitting probabilities of a one-dimensional diffusion on an interval $(l, r)$ are determined by its scale function, $s(x)$. The scale function is defined up to affine transformations, and its derivative, the scale density $s'(x)$, is given by:\n$$\ns'(x) = \\exp\\left( -\\int_{c}^{x} \\frac{2b(y)}{\\sigma(y)^2} dy \\right)\n$$\nfor some reference point $c  0$. In our case, this becomes:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{2b(y)}{\\sigma(y)^2} dy = \\int \\frac{2(\\frac{\\delta-1}{2y})}{1^2} dy = (\\delta-1) \\int \\frac{1}{y} dy = (\\delta-1) \\ln(y)\n$$\nWe have ignored the absolute value in the logarithm as the process $X_t^{(\\delta)}$ is positive. The scale density is therefore proportional to:\n$$\ns'(x) = \\exp(-(\\delta-1)\\ln(x)) = x^{-(\\delta-1)} = x^{1-\\delta}\n$$\nThe behavior of the diffusion process at the boundaries of its state space, here $0$ and $\\infty$, can be classified by the convergence or divergence of the integral of the scale density near these boundaries. For a process on $(0, \\infty)$ starting at $x_0  0$, the criterion for hitting the boundary at $0$ is as follows:\n- If the \"scale distance\" to $0$ is finite and the \"scale distance\" to $\\infty$ is infinite, the process is certain to hit $0$.\n- If the \"scale distance\" to $0$ is infinite and the \"scale distance\" to $\\infty$ is finite, the process will almost surely not hit $0$ and will instead escape to $\\infty$.\n\nThe scale distance from a point $x_0$ to a boundary is the integral of the scale density. Let $c$ be any point in $(0, \\infty)$, for instance $c=x_0$.\n- The scale distance to $0$ is finite if $\\int_0^c s'(y) dy  \\infty$.\n- The scale distance to $\\infty$ is finite if $\\int_c^\\infty s'(y) dy  \\infty$.\n\nLet's evaluate these integrals for $s'(y) = y^{1-\\delta}$.\nThe integral $\\int y^{p} dy$ converges at $0$ if $p  -1$, and converges at $\\infty$ if $p  -1$. In our case, $p=1-\\delta$.\n- The integral $\\int_0^c y^{1-\\delta} dy$ converges if $1-\\delta  -1$, which simplifies to $\\delta  2$.\n- The integral $\\int_c^\\infty y^{1-\\delta} dy$ converges if $1-\\delta  -1$, which simplifies to $\\delta  2$.\n\nNote that for $\\delta=2$, both integrals diverge. For $\\delta \\neq 2$, one converges and the other diverges. The hitting probability for the non-critical cases is therefore either $0$ or $1$.\n\nWe now apply this framework to the two sequences of parameters given in the problem.\n\n**Case 1: $\\delta = \\delta_{\\varepsilon}^{-} = 2 - \\varepsilon$**\nFor $0  \\varepsilon  1$, we have $1  \\delta_{\\varepsilon}^{-}  2$.\nIn this case, the parameter $\\delta$ satisfies $\\delta  2$.\n- The integral of the scale density near $0$: $\\int_0^c y^{1-(2-\\varepsilon)} dy = \\int_0^c y^{\\varepsilon-1} dy$. Since $0  \\varepsilon  1$, the exponent $\\varepsilon-1$ is in $(-1, 0)$, so $\\varepsilon-1  -1$. The integral converges. The scale distance to $0$ is finite.\n- The integral of the scale density near $\\infty$: $\\int_c^\\infty y^{\\varepsilon-1} dy$. Since $\\varepsilon-1  -1$, the integral diverges. The scale distance to $\\infty$ is infinite.\n\nSince the boundary at $0$ is finitely distant while the boundary at $\\infty$ is infinitely distant on the natural scale, the process will almost surely hit $0$. Thus, for any $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$,\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}\\Big[T_{0}^{(\\delta_{\\varepsilon}^{-})}  \\infty\\Big] = 1\n$$\n\n**Case 2: $\\delta = \\delta_{\\varepsilon}^{+} = 2 + \\varepsilon$**\nFor $0  \\varepsilon  1$, we have $2  \\delta_{\\varepsilon}^{+}  3$.\nIn this case, the parameter $\\delta$ satisfies $\\delta  2$.\n- The integral of the scale density near $0$: $\\int_0^c y^{1-(2+\\varepsilon)} dy = \\int_0^c y^{-1-\\varepsilon} dy$. Since $\\varepsilon  0$, the exponent $-1-\\varepsilon$ is less than $-1$. The integral diverges. The scale distance to $0$ is infinite.\n- The integral of the scale density near $\\infty$: $\\int_c^\\infty y^{-1-\\varepsilon} dy$. Since $-1-\\varepsilon  -1$, the integral converges. The scale distance to $\\infty$ is finite.\n\nSince the boundary at $0$ is infinitely distant while the boundary at $\\infty$ is finitely distant, the process will almost surely not hit $0$ and will instead escape to $\\infty$. Thus, for any $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$,\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}\\Big[T_{0}^{(\\delta_{\\varepsilon}^{+})}  \\infty\\Big] = 0\n$$\n\n**Final Computation**\nWe are asked to compute the limit:\n$$\nD(x_{0}) \\;:=\\; \\lim_{\\varepsilon \\downarrow 0} \\Big( \\mathbb{P}\\big[T_{0}^{(\\delta_{\\varepsilon}^{-})}  \\infty\\big] \\;-\\; \\mathbb{P}\\big[T_{0}^{(\\delta_{\\varepsilon}^{+})}  \\infty\\big] \\Big)\n$$\nSubstituting the probabilities we have determined, we get:\n$$\nD(x_0) = \\lim_{\\varepsilon \\downarrow 0} (1 - 0) = \\lim_{\\varepsilon \\downarrow 0} 1\n$$\nThe limit of a constant is the constant itself. Therefore,\n$$\nD(x_0) = 1\n$$\nThe result is independent of the initial condition $x_0  0$. This captures the sharp transition in the behavior of the Bessel process at the critical dimension $\\delta=2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "2997366"}]}
