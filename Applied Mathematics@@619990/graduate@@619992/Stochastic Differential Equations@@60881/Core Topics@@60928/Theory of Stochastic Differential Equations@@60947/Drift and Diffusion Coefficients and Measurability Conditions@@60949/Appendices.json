The given diffusion coefficient $\\sigma(x)$ is not continuous at $x=0$, as $\\lim_{x\\to 0^{-}} \\sigma(x) = 1$ while $\\sigma(0) = 2$. Therefore, $\\sigma(x)$ is not Lipschitz continuous, and these standard theorems do not apply directly.\n\nHowever, for one-dimensional SDEs, less restrictive conditions are sufficient. We are guided to use the concept of uniform ellipticity. A diffusion coefficient $\\sigma$ is said to be uniformly elliptic if there exists a constant $\\Lambda > 0$ such that $\\sigma(x)^{2} \\geq \\Lambda$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nLet us verify this condition for the given $\\sigma(x)$.\nFor $x < 0$, we have $\\sigma(x) = 1$, so $\\sigma(x)^{2} = 1^{2} = 1$.\nFor $x \\geq 0$, we have $\\sigma(x) = 2$, so $\\sigma(x)^{2} = 2^{2} = 4$.\nThus, for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $\\sigma(x)^{2} \\geq 1$. We can choose the uniform ellipticity constant $\\Lambda = 1$.\n\nThe uniform ellipticity condition is crucial because it implies that the function $x \\mapsto 1/\\sigma(x)^2$ is bounded. Specifically, $\\sigma(x)^{2} \\geq \\Lambda$ implies $0 < 1/\\sigma(x)^{2} \\leq 1/\\Lambda$. For our case, $0 < 1/\\sigma(x)^{2} \\leq 1$.\nA function that is bounded and Borel measurable (which $1/\\sigma^2$ is, since $\\sigma$ is) is locally integrable, i.e., $1/\\sigma^2 \\in L^1_{\\text{loc}}(\\mathbb{R})$. This means that for any compact interval $[a,b] \\subset \\mathbb{R}$, the integral $\\int_a^b \\frac{1}{\\sigma(x)^2} dx$ is finite.\n\nWe now invoke a well-tested result from the theory of one-dimensional SDEs, namely the Engelbert-Schmidt theorem. For an SDE of the form $dX_{t} = \\sigma(X_{t})\\,dW_{t}$ with a Borel measurable coefficient $\\sigma$, the condition $1/\\sigma^2 \\in L^1_{\\text{loc}}(\\mathbb{R})$ is sufficient for the existence of a weak solution.\n\nFurthermore, the same condition, $1/\\sigma^2 \\in L^1_{\\text{loc}}(\\mathbb{R})$, is also sufficient to guarantee that the weak solution is unique in law.\n\nFinally, we apply the Yamada-Watanabe theorem. This fundamental result states that for a given SDE, the existence of a weak solution that is unique in law implies the existence of a pathwise unique strong solution.\n\nIn summary, the argument proceeds as follows:\n1. The coefficient $\\sigma(x)$ is uniformly elliptic with $\\sigma(x)^2 \\geq 1$.\n2. This implies $1/\\sigma(x)^2 \\leq 1$, so $1/\\sigma^2$ is bounded and Borel measurable, and therefore belongs to $L^1_{\\text{loc}}(\\mathbb{R})$.\n3. By the Engelbert-Schmidt theorem, the condition $1/\\sigma^2 \\in L^1_{\\text{loc}}(\\mathbb{R})$ ensures the existence of a weak solution that is unique in law.\n4. By the Yamada-Watanabe theorem, the existence and uniqueness in law of a weak solution guarantees the existence of a strong solution.\nThus, a strong solution to the given SDE exists.\n\n**Task 2: Progressive Measurability of $\\sigma(X_t)$**\n\nWe need to prove that the process $Y_t = \\sigma(X_t)$ is progressively measurable with respect to $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \\geq 0}$.\n\nA real-valued process $(Z_t)_{t\\geq 0}$ is progressively measurable with respect to a filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \\geq 0}$ if for every $T \\geq 0$, the mapping $(t, \\omega) \\mapsto Z_t(\\omega)$ from $[0, T] \\times \\Omega$ into $\\mathbb{R}$ is $\\mathcal{B}([0,T]) \\otimes \\mathcal{F}_T$-measurable, where $\\mathcal{B}([0,T])$ is the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra on $[0,T]$.\n\nLet $X = (X_t)_{t \\geq 0}$ be a solution to the SDE. By definition of a solution, $X$ is an adapted process. Furthermore, any solution to an SDE driven by a continuous process like Brownian motion must itself be a continuous process (almost surely). Thus, $X$ is a continuous and adapted process.\n\nA standard result in stochastic processes states that any continuous, adapted process is progressively measurable. To be self-contained as requested, we sketch the proof. Fix $T \\geq 0$. We want to show the map $\\phi: [0, T] \\times \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $\\phi(t,\\omega) = X_t(\\omega)$ is $\\mathcal{B}([0,T]) \\otimes \\mathcal{F}_T$-measurable. For each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, define an approximating process $X_t^n = X_{\\frac{k}{n}}(\\omega)$ for $t \\in [\\frac{k}{n}, \\frac{k+1}{n})$ and $k=0, 1, \\dots, \\lfloor nT \\rfloor-1$. This process is left-continuous and adapted, and thus progressively measurable. Since $X_t$ is a continuous process, $X_t^n(\\omega) \\to X_t(\\omega)$ for every $(t,\\omega)$ as $n \\to \\infty$. The pointwise limit of a sequence of measurable functions is measurable. Therefore, the map $\\phi$ is $\\mathcal{B}([0,T]) \\otimes \\mathcal{F}_T$-measurable, which means the process $X$ is progressively measurable.\n\nNow we consider the process $Y_t = \\sigma(X_t)$. We need to show that for any $T \\geq 0$, the map $\\psi: [0, T] \\times \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}$ given by $\\psi(t, \\omega) = \\sigma(X_t(\\omega))$ is $\\mathcal{B}([0,T]) \\otimes \\mathcal{F}_T$-measurable.\n\nThis map $\\psi$ is a composition of two functions: $\\psi = \\sigma \\circ \\phi$, where $\\phi(t, \\omega) = X_t(\\omega)$ and $\\sigma: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n1. We have just established that the process $X$ is progressively measurable. This means the map $\\phi: ([0, T] \\times \\Omega, \\mathcal{B}([0,T]) \\otimes \\mathcal{F}_T) \\to (\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R}))$ is a measurable function.\n2. The problem statement specifies that the function $\\sigma: \\mathbb{R} \\to (0,\\infty)$ is Borel measurable. This means $\\sigma: (\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})) \\to (\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R}))$ is a measurable function.\n\nThe composition of two measurable functions is measurable. Therefore, the composite map $\\psi = \\sigma \\circ \\phi$ is a measurable function from $([0, T] \\times \\Omega, \\mathcal{B}([0,T]) \\otimes \\mathcal{F}_T)$ to $(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R}))$.\n\nSince this holds for any $T \\geq 0$, the process $t \\mapsto \\sigma(X_t)$ is progressively measurable by definition.\n\n**Task 3: Computation of the Integral**\n\nWe are asked to compute the scalar quantity $I = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{1}{\\sigma(x)^{2}}\\,dx$.\n\nThe function $\\sigma(x)$ is defined piecewise:\n$$\n\\sigma(x)\\;=\\; \\begin{cases}\n1, & x<0,\\\\\n2, & x \\geq 0.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nConsequently, the function $1/\\sigma(x)^2$ is also piecewise:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sigma(x)^{2}}\\;=\\; \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{1}{1^{2}} = 1, & x<0,\\\\\n\\frac{1}{2^{2}} = \\frac{1}{4}, & x \\geq 0.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe integral's domain is $[-1, 1]$.

The map $x \\mapsto b(t,x)$ is therefore $x \\mapsto c_t x$, which is a linear function of $x$. Linear functions are continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$.

A function is jointly measurable if the preimage of any Borel set is in the product $\\sigma$-algebra. Let's consider the function $h(t,x) = \\mathbf{1}_{N}(t)x$. The function $b(t,x)$ can be written as the sum of two functions: $g(t,x) = tx$ and $h(t,x)$. The function $g(t,x)$ is continuous on $[0,1] \\times \\mathbb{R}$ and is therefore jointly measurable. If $b(t,x)$ were jointly measurable, then $h(t,x) = b(t,x) - g(t,x)$ would also be jointly measurable as the difference of two measurable functions.\nLet's check the measurability of $h(t,x)$. Consider the set $S = h^{-1}((1, \\infty)) = \\{(t,x) \\in [0,1]\\times\\mathbb{R} \\mid \\mathbf{1}_{N}(t)x > 1\\}$. This condition is satisfied if and only if $t \\in N$ (so $\\mathbf{1}_{N}(t) = 1$) and $x > 1$. Thus, $S = N \\times (1, \\infty)$.

The set $(1, \\infty)$ is a Borel set in $\\mathbb{R}$. However, the problem states that $N$ is not a Borel set in $[0,1]$. Therefore, the set $S = N \\times (1, \\infty)$ is not an element of $\\mathcal{B}([0,1])\\otimes\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})$. Since the preimage of the Borel set $(1, \\infty)$ is not a measurable set in the product space, the function $h(t,x)$ is not jointly measurable. Consequently, $b(t,x)$ is not jointly measurable.\n\nThe theory of SDEs typically requires the coefficients to be progressively measurable.

A fundamental property of the Lebesgue integral is that it does not change if the integrand is modified on a set of measure zero. This means that we can replace $b(t,x)$ with a version $\\tilde{b}(t,x)$ that is equal to $b(t,x)$ for Lebesgue-almost every $t \\in [0,1]$, without changing the value of the integral and thus the solution to the SDE.\n\nWe seek a jointly measurable version $\\tilde{b}(t,x)$ such that for a fixed Lebesgue-null set $M \\subset [0,1]$, we have $\\tilde{b}(t,x) = b(t,x)$ for all $t \\in [0,1] \\setminus M$ and for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.

The function $\\mathbf{1}_{N}(t)$ is equal to the zero function for all $t \\notin N$. Let's define $\\tilde{b}(t,x) = tx$.\nThis function $\\tilde{b}(t,x)$ is continuous on $[0,1]\\times\\mathbb{R}$ and is therefore jointly measurable.\nFor any $t \\in [0,1] \\setminus N$, we have $\\mathbf{1}_{N}(t) = 0$, so $b(t,x) = (t+0)x = tx$. Thus, $\\tilde{b}(t,x) = b(t,x)$ for all $t \\in [0,1]\\setminus N$ and for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Since $\\lambda(N)=0$, the condition is satisfied.\n\nWe can therefore analyze the SDE with the well-behaved coefficient $\\tilde{b}(t,x)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}X_{t} = tX_{t}\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{t}.\n$$\nThis is a linear SDE. To find the expectation $\\mathbb{E}[X_{1}]$, let's derive the dynamics of $\\mu_{t} = \\mathbb{E}[X_{t}]$. Taking the expectation of the SDE in its integral form:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_{t}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[x_{0} + \\int_{0}^{t} sX_{s}\\,\\mathrm{d}s + \\int_{0}^{t} \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{s}\\right].\n$$\nUsing the linearity of expectation and Fubini's theorem:\n$$\n\\mu_{t} = x_{0} + \\int_{0}^{t} s\\mathbb{E}[X_{s}]\\,\\mathrm{d}s + \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{t} \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{s}\\right].\n$$\nThe It√¥ integral of a deterministic integrand (or more generally, an adapted integrand satisfying certain integrability conditions) has zero expectation. Since $\\sigma$ is constant, $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{t} \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{s}\\right] = 0$.\nSo, we obtain an ordinary integral equation for $\\mu_{t}$:\n$$\n\\mu_{t} = x_{0} + \\int_{0}^{t} s\\mu_{s}\\,\\mathrm{d}s.\n$$\nDifferentiating with respect to $t$ gives the ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mu_{t}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = t\\mu_{t}.\n$$\nThe initial condition is $\\mu_{0} = \\mathbb{E}[X_{0}] = x_{0}$. This is a separable first-order linear ODE.\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mu_{t}}{\\mu_{t}} = t\\,\\mathrm{d}t.\n$$\nIntegrating from $s=0$ to $s=t$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mu_{0}}^{\\mu_{t}} \\frac{1}{\\mu}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu = \\int_{0}^{t} s\\,\\mathrm{d}s.\n$$\n$$\n[\\ln|\\mu|]_{\\mu_{0}}^{\\mu_{t}} = \\left[\\frac{s^{2}}{2}\\right]_{0}^{t}.\n$$\n$$\n\\ln|\\mu_{t}| - \\ln|\\mu_{0}| = \\frac{t^{2}}{2}.\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left|\\frac{\\mu_{t}}{\\mu_{0}}\\right| = \\frac{t^{2}}{2}.\n$$\nAssuming $x_{0} \\neq 0$, exponentiating both sides gives $|\\mu_{t}| = |\\mu_{0}|\\exp\\left(\\frac{t^{2}}{2}\\right)$. Since the solution must be continuous in $t$ and $\\exp(\\cdot)$ is always positive, $\\mu_t$ cannot change sign, so $\\mu_{t} = \\mu_{0}\\exp\\left(\\frac{t^{2}}{2}\\right)$. If $x_0=0$, the unique solution is $\\mu_t=0$, which also fits this formula.\nSubstituting $\\mu_{0}=x_{0}$, we have the solution for the expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_{t}] = x_{0}\\exp\\left(\\frac{t^{2}}{2}\\right).\n$$\nWe need to find $\\mathbb{E}[X_{1}]$. We substitute $t=1$ into the expression:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_{1}] = x_{0}\\exp\\left(\\frac{1^{2}}{2}\\right) = x_{0}\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right).\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the expectation. It is independent of the diffusion coefficient $\\sigma$, which is a general property for the expectation of solutions to linear SDEs with additive noise.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{x_{0}\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}$$", "id": "2973985"}]}
