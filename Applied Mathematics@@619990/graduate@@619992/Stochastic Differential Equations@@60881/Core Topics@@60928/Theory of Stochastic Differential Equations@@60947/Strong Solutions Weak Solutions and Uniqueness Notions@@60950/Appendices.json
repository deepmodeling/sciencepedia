Verification of Conditions for the Diffusion Coefficient, $\\sigma(x)=\\sigma$:**\n- **Global Lipschitz Condition:** For any $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we must find a constant $L_\\sigma \\ge 0$ such that $|\\sigma(x) - \\sigma(y)| \\le L_\\sigma|x-y|$. We have $|\\sigma - \\sigma| = 0$, so $0 \\le L_\\sigma|x-y|$ is true for any $L_\\sigma \\ge 0$. The condition is satisfied.\n- **Linear Growth Condition:** For any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we must find a constant $K_\\sigma \\ge 0$ such that $|\\sigma(x)|^2 \\le K_\\sigma(1+x^2)$. We have $|\\sigma|^2 \\le K_\\sigma(1+x^2)$. Since $\\sigma$ is a constant and $1+x^2 \\ge 1$, we can choose $K_\\sigma = |\\sigma|^2$, and the inequality $|\\sigma|^2 \\le |\\sigma|^2(1+x^2)$ holds for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The condition is satisfied.\n\n**2. Verification of Conditions for the Drift Coefficient, $b(x)=\\frac{x}{1+x^2}$:**\n- **Global Lipschitz Condition:** We examine the derivative of $b(x)$ to find its maximum absolute value.\n$$\nb'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{x}{1+x^2}\\right) = \\frac{1 \\cdot (1+x^2) - x \\cdot (2x)}{(1+x^2)^2} = \\frac{1-x^2}{(1+x^2)^2}.\n$$\nTo find the maximum of $|b'(x)|$, we note that $b'(0) = 1$ and for $x\\to\\pm\\infty$, $b'(x) \\to 0$. The absolute value of the numerator $|1-x^2|$ is bounded, while the denominator grows. A brief analysis shows that the maximum value of $|b'(x)|$ occurs at $x=0$, where $|b'(0)| = 1$. Therefore, $|b'(x)| \\le 1$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. By the Mean Value Theorem, for any $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, there exists a $c$ between $x$ and $y$ such that $|b(x)-b(y)| = |b'(c)||x-y|$. This implies $|b(x)-b(y)| \\le 1 \\cdot |x-y|$. Thus, $b(x)$ is globally Lipschitz with a Lipschitz constant $L_b=1$.\n- **Linear Growth Condition:** We need to find a constant $K_b \\ge 0$ such that $|b(x)|^2 \\le K_b(1+x^2)$.\n$$\n|b(x)|^2 = \\left|\\frac{x}{1+x^2}\\right|^2 = \\frac{x^2}{(1+x^2)^2}.\n$$\nFor any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $x^2 < (1+x^2)^2$, which implies $|b(x)|^2 < 1$. We can choose $K_b=1$. The inequality $1 \\le 1 \\cdot (1+x^2)$ is true for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Thus, $|b(x)|^2 \\le K_b(1+x^2)$ is satisfied.\n\nSince both coefficients $b(x)$ and $\\sigma(x)$ satisfy the global Lipschitz and linear growth conditions, the fundamental theorem on existence and uniqueness for SDEs guarantees that for any initial condition $X_0=x_0$, there exists a pathwise unique strong solution $(X_t)_{t \\ge 0}$.\n\n**Uniqueness in Law and the Yamada–Watanabe Theorem:**\nPathwise uniqueness is a stronger notion than uniqueness in law (also called weak uniqueness). If a solution is pathwise unique, it means that for a given Brownian motion $W_t$ and initial condition $x_0$, there is only one process $X_t$ that solves the SDE. This implies that the law (the probability distribution on the space of continuous functions) of the solution process is uniquely determined by the law of the initial condition. Therefore, pathwise uniqueness implies uniqueness in law.\n\nThe Yamada–Watanabe theorem formalizes the relationship between weak solutions, strong solutions, and uniqueness. One part of the theorem states that if pathwise uniqueness holds for an SDE, then weak existence implies strong existence. More broadly, the theorem establishes the equivalence: (weak existence and pathwise uniqueness) $\\iff$ (strong existence). In our context, since standard theorems guarantee weak existence under linear growth conditions (which we have verified), and we have established pathwise uniqueness, the Yamada-Watanabe theorem confirms the existence of a strong solution. The principle that pathwise uniqueness implies weak uniqueness is a crucial part of this theoretical framework.\n\nb) **Canonical Semimartingale Decomposition**\n\nThe SDE $dX_t = b(X_t)dt + \\sigma dW_t$ with $X_0=x_0$ can be written in its integral form:\n$$\nX_t = x_0 + \\int_0^t b(X_s) ds + \\int_0^t \\sigma dW_s.\n$$\nA continuous semimartingale is a stochastic process that can be decomposed as the sum of a continuous local martingale and a continuous process of finite variation. Let us define:\n- $A_t = \\int_0^t b(X_s) ds$\n- $M_t = \\int_0^t \\sigma dW_s$\n\nThen the solution can be written as $X_t = X_0 + A_t + M_t$. We must justify that this is a valid semimartingale decomposition.\n\n**1. The Finite-Variation Component, $A_t$:**\nThe process $A_t$ is a process of finite variation if its total variation on any finite time interval $[0, T]$ is almost surely finite. The total variation $V_T(A)$ is given by:\n$$\nV_T(A) = \\int_0^T |dA_s| = \\int_0^T |b(X_s)| ds.\n$$\nAs established in part (a), $|b(x)| = |\\frac{x}{1+x^2}| \\le 1$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Therefore,\n$$\nV_T(A) = \\int_0^T |b(X_s)| ds \\le \\int_0^T 1 ds = T.\n$$\nSince the total variation is almost surely finite (in fact, deterministically bounded) on any finite interval $[0,T]$, $A_t$ is a process of finite variation. Since the solution $X_s$ has continuous paths, the integrand $s \\mapsto b(X_s(\\omega))$ is a continuous function of $s$ for almost every $\\omega$. The integral of a continuous function is itself continuous. Thus, $A_t$ is a continuous process of finite variation.\n\n**2. The Local Martingale Component, $M_t$:**\nThe process $M_t = \\int_0^t \\sigma dW_s$ is a stochastic integral with respect to a standard Brownian motion $W_t$. The integrand is the constant $\\sigma$. A stochastic integral $\\int_0^t H_s dW_s$ is a continuous local martingale provided the integrand $H_s$ is a predictable process satisfying $\\int_0^t H_s^2 ds < \\infty$ almost surely for all $t \\ge 0$. Here, the integrand is $H_s = \\sigma$, which is a deterministic constant and hence a predictable process. The condition is\n$$\n\\int_0^t \\sigma^2 ds = \\sigma^2 t < \\infty\n$$\nfor all finite $t$. This condition is clearly met. In fact, since $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^t \\sigma^2 ds\\right] = \\sigma^2 t < \\infty$, the Itô integral $M_t$ is not just a local martingale, but a true martingale (specifically, a scaled Brownian motion, $M_t = \\sigma W_t$). It is a fundamental property of the Itô integral that its sample paths are continuous.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe process $X_t$ can be decomposed as $X_t = X_0 + A_t + M_t$, where $X_0=x_0$ is the constant initial value, $A_t$ is a continuous process of finite variation, and $M_t$ is a continuous local martingale. By definition, this makes $X_t$ a continuous semimartingale. Its canonical decomposition is $X_t = X_0 + M_t + A_t$.\n\nc) **Computation of the Quadratic Variation $[X]_t$**\n\nThe quadratic variation of a continuous semimartingale $X_t$ is defined as the limit in probability of the sum of squared increments over a partition $\\Pi = \\{0=t_0 < t_1 < \\dots < t_n = t\\}$ of the interval $[0, t]$ as the mesh $|\\Pi| = \\max_i(t_i - t_{i-1})$ goes to zero.\n$$\n[X]_t = \\lim_{|\\Pi| \\to 0} \\sum_{i=1}^n (X_{t_i} - X_{t_{i-1}})^2.\n$$\nWe use the semimartingale decomposition $X_t = X_0 + A_t + M_t$. Since $X_0$ is a constant, $[X]_t = [X - X_0]_t = [A + M]_t$. Using the bilinearity of the quadratic covariation, which follows from its definition as a limit of sums:\n$$\n[X]_t = [A + M]_t = [A]_t + 2[A, M]_t + [M]_t.\n$$\nWe evaluate each term based on fundamental principles:\n- **$[A]_t$**: $A_t$ is a continuous process of finite variation. For such a process, its quadratic variation is zero. To see this from the definition, let $V_t(A)$ be the total variation of $A$ on $[0,t]$. Then $\\sum_{i=1}^n |A_{t_i} - A_{t_{i-1}}|^2 \\le \\max_i|A_{t_i} - A_{t_{i-1}}| \\sum_{i=1}^n |A_{t_i} - A_{t_{i-1}}| \\le \\max_i|A_{t_i} - A_{t_{i-1}}| \\cdot V_t(A)$. Since $A_t$ has continuous paths, $\\max_i|A_{t_i} - A_{t_{i-1}}| \\to 0$ as $|\\Pi| \\to 0$. Since $V_t(A)$ is finite, the entire expression converges to $0$. Thus, $[A]_t=0$.\n\n- **$[A, M]_t$**: This is the quadratic covariation between a continuous finite variation process $A_t$ and a continuous local martingale $M_t$. Its value is zero. This can be shown using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on the defining sum:\n$$\n\\left| \\sum_{i=1}^n (A_{t_i}-A_{t_{i-1}})(M_{t_i}-M_{t_{i-1}}) \\right| \\le \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n (A_{t_i}-A_{t_{i-1}})^2 \\right)^{1/2} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n (M_{t_i}-M_{t_{i-1}})^2 \\right)^{1/2}.\n$$\nIn the limit as $|\\Pi| \\to 0$, this inequality becomes $|[A, M]_t| \\le ([A]_t)^{1/2} ([M]_t)^{1/2}$. Since $[A]_t=0$, it follows that $[A, M]_t=0$.\n\n- **$[M]_t$**: The local martingale component is $M_t = \\int_0^t \\sigma dW_s$. Since $\\sigma$ is a constant, this simplifies to $M_t = \\sigma W_t$. The quadratic variation is then:\n$$\n[M]_t = [\\sigma W]_t = \\sigma^2 [W]_t.\n$$\nThis follows directly from the definition, as $\\sum (\\sigma(W_{t_i}-W_{t_{i-1}}))^2 = \\sigma^2 \\sum (W_{t_i}-W_{t_{i-1}})^2$. A fundamental property of standard Brownian motion is that its quadratic variation is $[W]_t = t$. Therefore, $[M]_t = \\sigma^2 t$.\n\nCombining these results, the quadratic variation of $X_t$ is:\n$$\n[X]_t = [A]_t + 2[A, M]_t + [M]_t = 0 + 2(0) + \\sigma^2 t = \\sigma^2 t.\n$$\n\nd) **Verification of the Semimartingale Structure**\n\nIn part (b), we identified the canonical semimartingale decomposition of the solution process $X_t$ as $X_t = X_0 + M_t + A_t$, where $M_t = \\int_0^t \\sigma dW_s$ is the continuous local martingale part and $A_t = \\int_0^t b(X_s) ds$ is the continuous finite-variation part.\n\nWe now use our computation of $[X]_t$ to verify this structure.\n1.  The finite-variation component is $A_t = \\int_0^t b(X_s) ds$. As argued in part (c), any continuous process of finite variation has zero quadratic variation. Therefore, $[A]_t = 0$. This confirms that the finite-variation component, by its very nature, has zero quadratic variation.\n2.  The local martingale component is $M_t = \\int_0^t \\sigma dW_s$. As shown in part (c), its quadratic variation is $[M]_t = \\sigma^2 t$.\n3.  The general theory for the quadratic variation of a semimartingale decomposition states that $[X]_t = [A+M]_t = [A]_t + 2[A,M]_t + [M]_t$. As shown, both $[A]_t$ and $[A,M]_t$ are zero. Thus, the theory predicts $[X]_t = [M]_t = \\sigma^2 t$.\n\nOur independent calculation in part (c) yielded $[X]_t = \\sigma^2 t$. This result matches the quadratic variation of the local martingale component, $[M]_t$, alone. This directly verifies that the identified semimartingale structure is correct, in the sense that the quadratic variation of the process $X_t$ is entirely captured by its local martingale part, while the finite-variation part makes no contribution.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sigma^2 t}\n$$", "id": "2999129"}, {"introduction": "Local existence and uniqueness provide a starting point, but they do not guarantee that a solution will remain finite for all time.

A simpler way is to note $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_\\infty \\le t) = \\lim_{R\\to\\infty} \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_R \\le t)$. Taking the limit as $R\\to\\infty$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_\\infty \\le t) = \\lim_{R\\to\\infty} \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_R \\le t) \\le \\lim_{R\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\bigl(1+V(x)\\bigr)\\exp(ct) - 1}{V_R} = 0\n$$\nThis holds for any $t>0$. Since the probability of explosion by any finite time $t$ is $0$, the probability of explosion at any time is $0$:\n$\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_\\infty < \\infty) = \\mathbb{P}(\\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty \\{\\tau_\\infty \\le n\\}) \\le \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_\\infty \\le n) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty 0 = 0$.\nThus, $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_\\infty = \\infty)=1$, meaning the solution does not explode in finite time, almost surely.\n\nThis non-explosion criterion is crucial for establishing global properties of solutions. The assumption that $b$ and $\\sigma$ are locally Lipschitz guarantees the existence of a unique local strong solution up to the explosion time $\\tau_\\infty$. The result $\\tau_\\infty=\\infty$ a.s. implies that this local solution extends to all time $t \\ge 0$, thus establishing the existence of a global strong solution. Pathwise uniqueness, which is also guaranteed locally by the Lipschitz condition, is thereby extended globally. Finally, by the Yamada-Watanabe theorem, the existence of a pathwise unique strong solution implies uniqueness in law for the SDE.\n\n### Verification and Calculation for the Worked Example\nWe are given the SDE:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}X_{t} = \\bigl(X_{t}-X_{t}^{3}\\bigr)\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sqrt{\\,1+X_{t}^{2}\\,}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{t}\n$$\nThe drift and diffusion coefficients are $b(x) = x-x^3$ and $\\sigma(x) = \\sqrt{1+x^2}$, respectively. Both are $C^\\infty$ and thus locally Lipschitz.\nThe candidate Lyapunov function is $V(x) = x^2$. We check its properties:\n$1$. $V(x) = x^2 \\in C^2(\\mathbb{R}; [0, \\infty))$.\n$2$. As $|x| \\to \\infty$, $V(x) = x^2 \\to \\infty$.\nThus, $V(x)$ is a valid candidate.\n\nWe compute $LV(x)$. The derivatives of $V(x)$ are $V'(x)=2x$ and $V''(x)=2$.\n$$\nLV(x) = b(x)V'(x) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma(x)^2V''(x)\n$$\n$$\nLV(x) = (x-x^3)(2x) + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{1+x^2}\\right)^2(2)\n$$\n$$\nLV(x) = 2x^2 - 2x^4 + (1+x^2) = -2x^4 + 3x^2 + 1\n$$\nWe need to find the smallest constant $c^\\star$ such that $LV(x) \\le c^\\star(1+V(x))$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n$$\n-2x^4 + 3x^2 + 1 \\le c^\\star(1+x^2)\n$$\nSince $1+x^2 > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we can divide by it. The constant $c^\\star$ must be an upper bound for the function $f(x) = \\frac{-2x^4 + 3x^2 + 1}{1+x^2}$. Thus, $c^\\star$ is the supremum of this function.\n$$\nc^\\star = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} \\frac{-2x^4 + 3x^2 + 1}{1+x^2}\n$$\nLet $y=x^2$. Since $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $y \\in [0, \\infty)$. We need to find the maximum of the function $g(y)$ for $y \\ge 0$:\n$$\ng(y) = \\frac{-2y^2 + 3y + 1}{1+y}\n$$\nWe perform polynomial long division or an algebraic rearrangement:\n$$\n-2y^2 + 3y + 1 = -2y(y+1) + 2y + 3y + 1 = -2y(y+1) + 5y + 1\n$$\n$$\n= -2y(y+1) + 5(y+1) - 5 + 1 = -2y(y+1) + 5(y+1) - 4\n$$\nSo, $g(y) = \\frac{-2y(y+1) + 5(y+1) - 4}{y+1} = -2y + 5 - \\frac{4}{1+y}$.\nTo find the maximum, we compute the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it to $0$:\n$$\ng'(y) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}y}\\left(-2y + 5 - 4(1+y)^{-1}\\right) = -2 - 4(-1)(1+y)^{-2} = -2 + \\frac{4}{(1+y)^2}\n$$\nSet $g'(y) = 0$:\n$$\n-2 + \\frac{4}{(1+y)^2} = 0 \\implies (1+y)^2 = 2 \\implies 1+y = \\sqrt{2}\n$$\nWe take the positive root since $y \\ge 0$. This gives the critical point $y = \\sqrt{2}-1$. This value is in the domain $[0, \\infty)$ since $\\sqrt{2} > 1$.\nThe second derivative is $g''(y) = -8(1+y)^{-3}$, which is negative for $y > -1$. At $y = \\sqrt{2}-1$, $g''(y) < 0$, so this point is a local maximum.\nAs $y \\to \\infty$, $g(y) \\approx -2y \\to -\\infty$. Thus, the local maximum is the global maximum for $y \\ge 0$.\nThe maximum value is attained at $y = \\sqrt{2}-1$:\n$$\nc^\\star = g(\\sqrt{2}-1) = -2(\\sqrt{2}-1) + 5 - \\frac{4}{1+(\\sqrt{2}-1)}\n$$\n$$\nc^\\star = -2\\sqrt{2} + 2 + 5 - \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{2}} = 7 - 2\\sqrt{2} - \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 7 - 2\\sqrt{2} - 2\\sqrt{2}\n$$\n$$\nc^\\star = 7 - 4\\sqrt{2}\n$$\nThis value is positive since $7 = \\sqrt{49}$ and $4\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{32}$. Thus, the non-explosion criterion holds for this SDE with the constant $c=c^\\star$, confirming that its solution exists for all time.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{7 - 4\\sqrt{2}}\n$$", "id": "2999087"}, {"introduction": "The foundational theorems guaranteeing uniqueness rely on specific regularity conditions, and understanding their limits is key to mastering SDE theory.

The initial state is $x_0 = 0$. Since the coefficient $\\sigma(x)$ is not Lipschitz continuous at $x=0$ for $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$, standard existence and uniqueness theorems do not apply. We must analyze the structure of the SDE more closely.\n\nA central result for pathwise uniqueness of such SDEs is the Engelbert-Schmidt zero-one law, which relates uniqueness to the local integrability of $\\sigma(x)^{-2}$ around the starting point. Pathwise uniqueness for solutions starting at $x_0$ holds if and only if the integral $\\int_{U} \\sigma(x)^{-2} \\, dx$ is infinite for every neighborhood $U$ of $x_0$. In our case, $x_0=0$, so we must analyze the integral of $\\sigma(x)^{-2} = (|x|^{\\alpha})^{-2} = |x|^{-2\\alpha}$ in a neighborhood of $0$.\n\nThe problem specifically asks for a justification using a time-change construction, which we now develop. A key insight is that any weak solution to this SDE, being a continuous local martingale, can be represented as a time-changed Brownian motion.\n\nLet $X = \\{X_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ be any weak solution to the SDE starting at $X_0 = 0$. The trivial process $X_t \\equiv 0$ for all $t \\geq 0$ is a valid solution, since both sides of the SDE are identically zero. Pathwise uniqueness fails if and only if there exists at least one non-trivial solution.\n\nLet's construct solutions from a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion $B = \\{B_s\\}_{s \\geq 0}$ starting at $B_0=0$. A weak solution $X$ can be constructed by time-changing $B$. Define a continuous, non-decreasing process $A_s$, called the \"clock\" or additive functional, by\n$$\nA_s = \\int_0^s \\sigma(B_u)^{-2} \\, du = \\int_0^s |B_u|^{-2\\alpha} \\, du\n$$\nLet $\\tau_t$ be the right-continuous inverse of $A_s$:\n$$\n\\tau_t = \\inf\\{s \\geq 0 : A_s > t\\}\n$$\nThen, the process $X_t = B_{\\tau_t}$ is a weak solution to the SDE $dX_t = \\sigma(X_t) \\, dW_t$.\n\nFor a non-trivial solution to exist, the time-change $\\tau_t$ must be finite and non-zero for $t > 0$. This requires the clock process $A_s$ to be finite almost surely for all $s > 0$. If $A_s$ were to diverge to infinity for an arbitrarily small $s > 0$, then $\\tau_t$ would be identically zero for all $t$, leading to $X_t = B_0 = 0$, the trivial solution.\n\nThe core of the analysis is to determine when $A_s$ is finite. As instructed, we use the occupation-times formula, which relates the integral of a function of a Brownian path to an integral over the local time of the Brownian motion:\n$$\nA_s = \\int_0^s |B_u|^{-2\\alpha} \\, du = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |x|^{-2\\alpha} L_s^x(B) \\, dx\n$$\nwhere $L_s^x(B)$ is the local time of the Brownian motion $B$ at level $x$ up to time $s$. We are interested in whether this integral is finite or infinite. The integrand $|x|^{-2\\alpha}$ has a singularity at $x=0$. The local time $L_s^x(B)$ is a continuous function of the spatial variable $x$. For any $s > 0$, the Brownian path will have visited a neighborhood of $0$, and $L_s^0(B) > 0$ almost surely.\n\nThe convergence or divergence of the integral for $A_s$ is determined by the local integrability of the function $|x|^{-2\\alpha}$ around $x=0$. That is, the behavior of $A_s$ is dictated by the behavior of the integral\n$$\nI(\\varepsilon) = \\int_{-\\varepsilon}^{\\varepsilon} |x|^{-2\\alpha} \\, dx\n$$\nfor any $\\varepsilon > 0$. Due to symmetry, this is\n$$\nI(\\varepsilon) = 2 \\int_0^{\\varepsilon} x^{-2\\alpha} \\, dx\n$$\nThis is a standard p-integral. It converges if the exponent is greater than $-1$, and diverges otherwise.\nThe condition for convergence is $-2\\alpha > -1$, which simplifies to $2\\alpha < 1$, or $\\alpha < 1/2$.\nThe condition for divergence is $-2\\alpha \\leq -1$, which simplifies to $2\\alpha \\geq 1$, or $\\alpha \\geq 1/2$.\n\nLet's analyze the two cases:\n\nCase 1: $\\alpha \\geq 1/2$.\nIn this case, the integral $\\int_0^{\\varepsilon} x^{-2\\alpha} \\, dx$ diverges. The function $|x|^{-2\\alpha}$ is not locally integrable at $0$. For any $s > 0$, the Brownian motion $B$ almost surely spends a positive amount of time (in the sense of local time) in any neighborhood of $0$. The divergence of the integral implies that the additive functional $A_s = \\int_0^s |B_u|^{-2\\alpha} \\, du$ is almost surely infinite for any $s > 0$.\nIf $A_s = \\infty$ for all $s>0$, then its inverse $\\tau_t = \\inf\\{s : A_s > t\\}$ is $0$ for all $t \\geq 0$. The time-changed process is $X_t = B_{\\tau_t} = B_0 = 0$. This construction yields only the trivial solution. This aligns with the Engelbert-Schmidt criterion: since $\\sigma(x)^{-2}$ is not locally integrable at $0$, pathwise uniqueness holds. Any solution must be the trivial one. The \"cost\" for the process to leave the origin is infinite, which prevents the construction of non-trivial paths.\n\nCase 2: $\\alpha < 1/2$.\nIn this case, the integral $\\int_0^{\\varepsilon} x^{-2\\alpha} \\, dx$ converges. The function $|x|^{-2\\alpha}$ is locally integrable at $0$. This ensures that the additive functional $A_s = \\int_0^s |B_u|^{-2\\alpha} \\, du$ is finite almost surely for all finite $s$.\nConsequently, the inverse $\\tau_t = A_t^{-1}$ is a well-defined, strictly increasing, and finite process for $t \\geq 0$. The constructed process $X_t = B_{\\tau_t}$ is therefore a non-trivial solution to the SDE.\nSince we have the trivial solution $X_t \\equiv 0$ and we have just constructed a non-trivial solution $X_t = B_{\\tau_t}$, there are at least two distinct solutions starting from $X_0 = 0$. Therefore, pathwise uniqueness fails.\nThe problem mentions \"freedom to insert nontrivial holding times at $0$\". This is precisely what happens when $\\alpha < 1/2$. Because the singularity is integrable, the point $0$ is not \"sticky\" enough to enforce a unique exit behavior. One can construct a family of solutions $\\{X_t^c\\}_{c \\geq 0}$ defined by:\n$$\nX_t^c =\n\\begin{cases}\n0 & \\text{if } t \\leq c \\\\\nB_{\\tau_{t-c}} & \\text{if } t > c\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nEach of these processes is a valid weak solution that remains at $0$ for a duration $c$ before evolving non-trivially. The existence of this uncountable family of solutions is a strong manifestation of the failure of pathwise uniqueness.\n\nSummary of the findings:\n- For $\\alpha \\geq 1/2$, pathwise uniqueness holds.\n- For $\\alpha < 1/2$, pathwise uniqueness fails.\n\nThe problem asks for the critical threshold $\\alpha_c$ such that for all $\\alpha \\geq \\alpha_c$, uniqueness holds, and for all $\\alpha < \\alpha_c$, uniqueness fails. Based on our analysis, this critical threshold is precisely at the point where the integral of $|x|^{-2\\alpha}$ switches from divergent to convergent.\nThis transition occurs when $-2\\alpha = -1$, i.e., at $\\alpha = 1/2$.\n\nTherefore, the critical threshold exponent is $\\alpha_c=1/2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$", "id": "2999079"}]}
