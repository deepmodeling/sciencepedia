The derivation relies on the application of Itô's formula for continuous semimartingales.\n\nLet us begin by stating the relevant theorem. A continuous local martingale is a specific type of continuous semimartingale. Let $X = (X_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ be a continuous semimartingale and let $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a function of class $C^2$ (i.e., twice continuously differentiable).

The first integral is a stochastic integral with respect to the semimartingale $X$, and the second is a Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral with respect to the quadratic variation process $\\langle X \\rangle_t$. The conditions given in the problem statement—that $f'$ and $f''$ have at most polynomial growth—are sufficient to ensure that the integrands $f'(M_s)$ and $f''(M_s)$ satisfy the necessary conditions for these integrals to be well-defined.\n\nIn the context of this problem, the continuous semimartingale $X_t$ is the continuous local martingale $M_t$. We are given the process $Y_t = f(M_t)$. We can directly apply Itô's formula by substituting $X_t$ with $M_t$.

The quadratic covariation term $\\mathrm{d}[X,Y]_t$ can be informally calculated as $(\\mathrm{d}X_t)(\\mathrm{d}Y_t)$ using the Itô multiplication table: $\\mathrm{d}W_{t}^{k}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{t}^{l} = \\delta_{kl}\\,\\mathrm{d}t$, where $\\delta_{kl}$ is the Kronecker delta, and $\\mathrm{d}W_{t}^{k}\\,\\mathrm{d}t = \\mathrm{d}t\\,\\mathrm{d}t = 0$.\n\nApplying this to our case, we have\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}[M^{i}, M^{j}]_{t} = (\\mathrm{d}M_{t}^{i})(\\mathrm{d}M_{t}^{j}) = \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{d} \\sigma(t)^{ik}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{t}^{k}\\right) \\left(\\sum_{l=1}^{d} \\sigma(t)^{jl}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{t}^{l}\\right).\n$$\nExpanding the product and applying the Itô rules, we get\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}[M^{i}, M^{j}]_{t} = \\sum_{k=1}^{d} \\sum_{l=1}^{d} \\sigma(t)^{ik}\\sigma(t)^{jl}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{t}^{k}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{t}^{l} = \\sum_{k=1}^{d} \\sum_{l=1}^{d} \\sigma(t)^{ik}\\sigma(t)^{jl}\\,\\delta_{kl}\\,\\mathrm{d}t.\n$$\nThe sum over $l$ collapses due to the Kronecker delta, leaving only the terms where $l=k$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}[M^{i}, M^{j}]_{t} = \\sum_{k=1}^{d} \\sigma(t)^{ik}\\sigma(t)^{jk}\\,\\mathrm{d}t.\n$$\nThe sum $\\sum_{k=1}^{d} \\sigma(t)^{ik}\\sigma(t)^{jk}$ is precisely the $(i,j)$-th entry of the matrix product $\\sigma(t)\\sigma(t)^{\\top}$.

The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to evaluate the given statements.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in the change-of-variables formula for a convex function applied to a semimartingale, known as the Meyer-Itô-Tanaka formula. For a general real-valued semimartingale $X=(X_t)_{t\\ge 0}$ and a convex function $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$, the formula is given by:\n$$ f(X_t) = f(X_0) + \\int_0^t f'_{-}(X_{s-}) dX_s + \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} L_t^a(X^c) \\mu_{f''}(da) + \\sum_{0<s\\le t} \\left( f(X_s) - f(X_{s-}) - f'_{-}(X_{s-})\\Delta X_s \\right) $$\nHere, $f'_-$ denotes the left-hand derivative of $f$, $X_{s-}$ is the left-limit of the process at time $s$, $\\Delta X_s = X_s - X_{s-}$ is the jump size, $X^c$ is the continuous local martingale part of $X$, $L_t^a(X^c)$ is the local time of $X^c$ at level $a$, and $\\mu_{f''}$ is the non-negative Borel measure corresponding to the second derivative of $f$ in the sense of distributions. Since the problem specifies that $f$ is of class $C^1$, its left and right derivatives are equal and continuous, so we can write $f'(x)$ instead of $f'_-(x)$.\n\nThe process $M$ is a continuous local martingale. This implies two major simplifications to the general formula:\n$1$. Since $M$ is continuous, its jumps are zero, i.e., $\\Delta M_s = 0$ for all $s \\ge 0$. This causes the summation term to vanish.\n$2$. The continuous local martingale part of $M$ is $M$ itself, so $X^c = M$.\n\nThus, for a continuous local martingale $M$ and a $C^1$ convex function $f$, the Meyer-Itô-Tanaka formula simplifies to the Itô-Tanaka formula:\n$$ f(M_t) = f(M_0) + \\int_0^t f'(M_s) dM_s + \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} L_t^a(M) \\mu_{f''}(da) $$\nWe will now evaluate each statement based on this established theory.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For a convex $C^1$ function $f$, there exists a unique nonnegative locally finite Borel measure $\\mu_f$ on $\\mathbb{R}$ such that for all $x<y$, one has $f'(y)-f'(x)=\\mu_f((x,y])$. Moreover, for any continuous local martingale $M$, one has for all $t\\ge 0$,**\n$$ f(M_t)=f(M_0)+\\int_0^t f'(M_s)\\,dM_s+\\frac12\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} L_t^a(M)\\,\\mu_f(da), $$\n**where the last integral is a Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral of $a\\mapsto L_t^a(M)$ with respect to $\\mu_f$.**\n\nThe first part of the statement concerns the properties of convex functions. Since $f$ is convex, its derivative $f'$ is a non-decreasing function. Any non-decreasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$ uniquely defines a non-negative Borel measure via the prescription $\\mu_f((x,y]) = f'(y)-f'(x)$. This is the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure associated with $f'$. Since $f'$ is a continuous real-valued function, it is finite on any compact interval, which means the measure $\\mu_f$ is locally finite. This measure $\\mu_f$ is precisely the second derivative of $f$ in the sense of distributions, i.e., $\\mu_f = \\mu_{f''}$.\n\nThe second part of the statement is the Itô-Tanaka formula for a continuous local martingale $M$ and a $C^1$ convex function $f$, as derived above. The formula is stated correctly, including the crucial factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$. The integral is correctly identified as a Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral, as $a\\mapsto L_t^a(M)$ is a continuous function of $a$ and $\\mu_f$ is a measure. Thus, the statement is entirely accurate.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. In the representation of the second derivative term via local time and $\\mu_f$, the numerical factor in front of the local time integral is $1$ rather than $\\tfrac12$, that is,**\n$$ f(M_t)=f(M_0)+\\int_0^t f'(M_s)\\,dM_s+\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} L_t^a(M)\\,\\mu_f(da)\\quad\\text{for all }t\\ge 0. $$\n\nThis statement proposes a version of the Itô-Tanaka formula with a factor of $1$ instead of $\\frac{1}{2}$. As established in the analysis of option A and from the standard formulation of the theorem, the correct factor is $\\frac{1}{2}$. This factor originates from the quadratic nature of the correction term in Itô's lemma. For example, the definitional formula for local time, $(M_t-a)^+ = (M_0-a)^+ + \\int_0^t \\mathbb{1}_{\\{M_s>a\\}}dM_s + \\frac{1}{2}L_t^a(M)$, confirms the factor is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Altering this factor to $1$ makes the formula incorrect.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The continuity of $M$ implies $L_t^a(M)=0$ for all $a\\neq M_t$, and therefore the local time term vanishes almost surely for any convex $C^1$ function $f$.**\n\nThis statement fundamentally misinterprets the concept of local time. $L_t^a(M)$ is a cumulative process that measures the \"time spent\" by the process $M$ at level $a$ over the entire interval $[0, t]$. The fact that $M_t \\neq a$ at the specific time $t$ does not imply that $M$ has not visited the level $a$ at some prior time $s \\in [0, t)$. For any non-constant continuous local martingale (like Brownian motion), it will visit a continuum of levels. For a standard Brownian motion $B_t$ starting at $0$, $L_t^0(B)$ is strictly positive for all $t > 0$ almost surely, while the probability that $B_t=0$ for any fixed $t>0$ is zero. The local time term is generally non-zero and represents the correction needed because $f$ is not necessarily $C^2$. The continuity of $M$ is what ensures the existence of a well-behaved (and typically non-zero) local time process.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. If $M$ is a continuous local martingale with $M_0=0$, then for any convex $C^1$ function $f$ one can always rewrite the second derivative term as**\n$$ \\frac12\\int_0^t f''(M_s)\\,d\\langle M\\rangle_s, $$\n**where $f''$ is interpreted as the Radon–Nikodym derivative of $\\mu_f$ with respect to Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb{R}$.**\n\nThis statement claims that the local time integral can always be expressed as an integral with respect to the quadratic variation process $\\langle M \\rangle$. The relation between the two forms is given by the occupation times formula: $\\int_0^t g(M_s) d\\langle M \\rangle_s = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g(a) L_t^a(M) da$.\nApplying this to the formula from option A, if we assume $\\mu_f(da) = f''(a)da$ (i.e., $\\mu_f$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure with density $f''$), then\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} L_t^a(M)\\,\\mu_f(da) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} L_t^a(M) f''(a) da = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^t f''(M_s) d\\langle M \\rangle_s $$\nThis rewriting is only valid if the measure $\\mu_f$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. However, this is not true for *every* convex $C^1$ function. For example, one can construct a $C^1$ convex function $f$ such that $f'$ is the Cantor function. The associated measure $\\mu_f$ is then the Cantor measure, which is purely singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure. For such a function, its Radon-Nikodym derivative $f''$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure is $0$ almost everywhere, so $\\int_0^t f''(M_s)d\\langle M \\rangle_s = 0$. But the local time term $\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} L_t^a(M) \\mu_f(da)$ is generally non-zero. The claim that this is *always* possible is therefore false. The condition $M_0=0$ is irrelevant to this general property of the function $f$.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. For a general semimartingale, the Tanaka-type change-of-variables formula for convex functions includes an additional sum over jumps. The continuity of $M$ eliminates this jump-sum, so only the stochastic integral and the integral of local time against $\\mu_f$ remain in the formula.**\n\nThis statement accurately describes the relationship between the general Meyer-Itô-Tanaka formula for semimartingales and the specific version for continuous local martingales. As shown in the preliminary discussion, the general formula contains a term $\\sum_{0<s\\le t} \\left( f(X_s) - f(X_{s-}) - f'_{-}(X_{s-})\\Delta X_s \\right)$ to account for the process's jumps. Since the process $M$ is continuous, $\\Delta M_s = M_s - M_{s-} = 0$ for all $s > 0$. Consequently, each term in the sum becomes $f(M_{s-}) - f(M_{s-}) - f'(M_{s-}) \\cdot 0 = 0$, and the entire sum vanishes. The remaining terms in the formula for $f(M_t) - f(M_0)$ are indeed the stochastic integral and the local time integral, as stated in option A. This statement correctly identifies the crucial role of the continuity of $M$ in simplifying the general formula.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "AE", "id": "2997675"}]}
