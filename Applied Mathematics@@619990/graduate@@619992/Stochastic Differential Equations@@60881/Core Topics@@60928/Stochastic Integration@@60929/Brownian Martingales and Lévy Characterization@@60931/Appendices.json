The derivation will be based on the Lévy characterization of Brownian motion, which states that it is a continuous martingale with $B_0=0$ and quadratic variation $[B]_t = t$, and will employ Itô's formula.\n\nConsider the complex-valued process $Z_s = \\exp(i u B_s)$ for $s \\in [0, t]$. Applying Itô's formula to the function $f(x) = \\exp(i u x)$ and the process $B_s$, we have:\n$$dZ_s = f'(B_s) \\, \\mathrm{d}B_s + \\frac{1}{2} f''(B_s) \\, \\mathrm{d}[B]_s$$\nThe derivatives of $f(x)$ are $f'(x) = i u \\exp(i u x)$ and $f''(x) = (i u)^2 \\exp(i u x) = -u^2 \\exp(i u x)$. The quadratic variation is given as $[B]_s = s$, so $\\mathrm{d}[B]_s = \\mathrm{d}s$.\nSubstituting these into the formula yields:\n$$dZ_s = i u \\exp(i u B_s) \\, \\mathrm{d}B_s + \\frac{1}{2} (-u^2 \\exp(i u B_s)) \\, \\mathrm{d}s$$\n$$dZ_s = i u Z_s \\, \\mathrm{d}B_s - \\frac{u^2}{2} Z_s \\, \\mathrm{d}s$$\nThis is a stochastic differential equation for $Z_s$. To find its expectation, we define an auxiliary process, an exponential martingale. Let us define the process $M_s = \\exp(i u B_s + \\frac{u^2}{2} s)$. This is constructed to cancel the drift term. Let's verify this using Itô's formula for the function $g(s, x) = \\exp(i u x + \\frac{u^2}{2} s)$ and the process $B_s$.\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial s} = \\frac{u^2}{2} g(s, x)$, $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = i u g(s, x)$, and $\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial x^2} = -u^2 g(s, x)$.\nApplying Itô's formula for time-dependent functions:\n$$dM_s = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial s}(s, B_s) \\, \\mathrm{d}s + \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}(s, B_s) \\, \\mathrm{d}B_s + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial x^2}(s, B_s) \\, \\mathrm{d}[B]_s$$\n$$dM_s = \\left(\\frac{u^2}{2} M_s\\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}s + (i u M_s) \\, \\mathrm{d}B_s + \\frac{1}{2} (-u^2 M_s) \\, \\mathrm{d}s$$\n$$dM_s = \\left(\\frac{u^2}{2} - \\frac{u^2}{2}\\right) M_s \\, \\mathrm{d}s + i u M_s \\, \\mathrm{d}B_s = i u M_s \\, \\mathrm{d}B_s$$\nThe drift term (the $\\mathrm{d}s$ term) is zero, which confirms that $M_s$ is a continuous local martingale. It is a standard result that for a Brownian motion, this exponential local martingale is in fact a true martingale.\nAs $M_s$ is a martingale, we have the property $\\mathbb{E}[M_t] = \\mathbb{E}[M_0]$.\nWe evaluate $M_0$:\n$$M_0 = \\exp(i u B_0 + \\frac{u^2}{2} \\cdot 0) = \\exp(0) = 1$$\nsince $B_0=0$ by definition of standard Brownian motion.\nTherefore, $\\mathbb{E}[M_t] = 1$. Let's write out $M_t$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\exp\\left(i u B_t + \\frac{u^2}{2} t\\right)\\right] = 1$$\n$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\exp(i u B_t) \\exp\\left(\\frac{u^2}{2} t\\right)\\right] = 1$$\nThe term $\\exp(\\frac{u^2}{2} t)$ is deterministic and can be factored out of the expectation:\n$$\\exp\\left(\\frac{u^2}{2} t\\right) \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(i u B_t)] = 1$$\nThe expectation term is the definition of the characteristic function $\\varphi_{B_t}(u)$.\n$$\\exp\\left(\\frac{u^2}{2} t\\right) \\varphi_{B_t}(u) = 1$$\nSolving for $\\varphi_{B_t}(u)$, we obtain the closed-form expression:\n$$\\varphi_{B_t}(u) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u^2 t}{2}\\right)$$\n\nSecond, we deduce the distribution of $B_t$ from its characteristic function. A random variable $X$ follows a Gaussian (normal) distribution with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$, denoted $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, if and only if its characteristic function has the form $\\varphi_X(u) = \\exp(i u \\mu - \\frac{u^2 \\sigma^2}{2})$.\nBy comparing our derived characteristic function $\\varphi_{B_t}(u) = \\exp(-\\frac{u^2 t}{2})$ with the general form, we can identify the parameters by inspection:\nThe coefficient of the $i u$ term in the exponent is $0$, so the mean is $\\mu = 0$.\nThe coefficient of the $-u^2/2$ term in the exponent is $t$, so the variance is $\\sigma^2 = t$.\nThus, we conclude that $B_t$ is a Gaussian random variable with mean $0$ and variance $t$, i.e., $B_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t)$.\n\nThird, as a consistency check, we justify the reflection principle. We need to show that for $a  0$, $\\mathbb{P}(\\sup_{0 \\leq s \\leq t} B_s \\geq a) = 2 \\mathbb{P}(B_t \\geq a)$.\nLet $M_t = \\sup_{0 \\leq s \\leq t} B_s$. Let $\\tau_a = \\inf\\{s \\geq 0: B_s = a\\}$ be the first time the process hits the level $a$. Since $B_s$ has continuous paths and $B_0=0  a$, the event $\\{M_t \\geq a\\}$ is identical to the event $\\{\\tau_a \\leq t\\}$.\nWe can partition this event based on the value of $B_t$:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(M_t \\geq a) = \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\leq t) = \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\leq t, B_t  a) + \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\leq t, B_t  a) + \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\leq t, B_t = a)$$\nSince $B_t$ has a continuous distribution, $\\mathbb{P}(B_t = a) = 0$, so the third term is zero.\nIf $B_t  a$, then by the continuity of paths, the process must have crossed the level $a$ at some time at or before $t$. Therefore, the event $\\{B_t  a\\}$ is a subset of the event $\\{\\tau_a \\leq t\\}$. This simplifies the first term:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\leq t, B_t  a) = \\mathbb{P}(B_t  a)$$\nFor the second term, we apply the strong Markov property at the stopping time $\\tau_a$. On the event $\\{\\tau_a \\leq t\\}$, the process $s \\mapsto B_{s+\\tau_a} - B_{\\tau_a} = B_{s+\\tau_a} - a$ is a Brownian motion starting from $0$ and is independent of the pre-$\\tau_a$ sigma-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a}$. By symmetry of Brownian motion, conditional on $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a}$, the probability of being above or below the starting point at a later time is equal. Specifically, for the increment $B_t - B_{\\tau_a}$, we have $\\mathbb{P}(B_t - B_{\\tau_a}  0 | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a}) = \\mathbb{P}(B_t - B_{\\tau_a}  0 | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a}) = 1/2$.\nApplying this, we find:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\leq t, B_t  a) = \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\leq t, B_t - B_{\\tau_a}  0) = \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\leq t, B_t - B_{\\tau_a}  0) = \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\leq t, B_t  a)$$\nThe middle equality holds by applying the law of total probability and the strong Markov property: $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{I}_{\\{\\tau_a \\leq t\\}}\\mathbb{P}(B_t-B_{\\tau_a}0|\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a})] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{I}_{\\{\\tau_a \\leq t\\}} \\frac{1}{2}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{I}_{\\{\\tau_a \\leq t\\}}\\mathbb{P}(B_t-B_{\\tau_a}0|\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a})]$.\nSo, we have shown $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\leq t, B_t  a) = \\mathbb{P}(B_t  a)$.\nSubstituting back:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(M_t \\geq a) = \\mathbb{P}(B_t  a) + \\mathbb{P}(B_t  a) = 2 \\mathbb{P}(B_t  a)$$\nSince $\\mathbb{P}(B_t = a) = 0$, we have $\\mathbb{P}(B_t  a) = \\mathbb{P}(B_t \\geq a)$, which completes the justification.\n\nFinally, we express the tail probability in terms of the standard normal CDF, $\\Phi(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp(-y^2/2) \\, \\mathrm{d}y$.\nWe have $B_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t)$. The standardized variable $Z = B_t/\\sqrt{t}$ follows a standard normal distribution, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.\n$$\\mathbb{P}(B_t \\geq a) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\frac{B_t}{\\sqrt{t}} \\geq \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{t}}\\right) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(Z \\geq \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{t}}\\right)$$\nThis tail probability is given by $1 - \\mathbb{P}(Z  a/\\sqrt{t}) = 1 - \\Phi(a/\\sqrt{t})$.\nTherefore, the probability of the supremum is:\n$$\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\sup_{0 \\leq s \\leq t} B_s \\geq a\\right) = 2 \\mathbb{P}(B_t \\geq a) = 2\\left(1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{t}}\\right)\\right)$$\n\nThe problem requires the single closed-form expression for $\\varphi_{B_{t}}(u)$ as the final answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{u^{2} t}{2}\\right)}$$", "id": "2993856"}, {"introduction": "Not every continuous local martingale $M$ has a quadratic variation of $[M]_t = t$, but many can be transformed into a Brownian motion via a change in the 'clock' they run on.

It concerns the properties of a time-changed continuous local martingale, a central topic in stochastic calculus covered by the Dambis-Dubins-Schwarz (DDS) theorem. All definitions and statements are standard and mathematically precise.\n\nThe core of the problem is to understand why the process $(B_s)_{s\\ge 0}$, which is a standard Brownian motion with respect to the time-changed filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_{T_s})_{s\\ge 0}$, does not, in general, retain this property when viewed with respect to the original filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ (indexed by the new time parameter $s$). A process being a Brownian motion with respect to a given filtration $(\\mathcal{G}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ requires several properties, most notably that it is adapted to $(\\mathcal{G}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ and that its increments are independent of the past, i.e., for $rs$, the increment $B_s-B_r$ is independent of the $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{G}_r$.\n\nThe fundamental reason for the properties to fail with respect to $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ is the mismatch between the filtrations $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ and $(\\mathcal{F}_{T_s})_{s\\ge 0}$. The time $T_s = \\inf\\{t\\ge 0: [M]_t  s\\}$ is a random variable that depends on the path of the quadratic variation process $[M]_t$. In general, $T_s$ is not equal to the deterministic time $s$. This means that the information available at time $s$ in the original filtration, $\\mathcal{F}_s$, is generally different from the information available at the random time $T_s$, which is contained in $\\mathcal{F}_{T_s}$.\n\nA process $(X_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ is adapted to a filtration $(\\mathcal{G}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ if for every $s\\ge 0$, the random variable $X_s$ is $\\mathcal{G}_s$-measurable. For our process $B_s = M_{T_s}$ to be adapted to $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$, $M_{T_s}$ must be $\\mathcal{F}_s$-measurable for all $s$. The value of $M_{T_s}$ depends on the path of $M$ up to the random time $T_s$. If it is possible for $T_s  s$, then $M_{T_s}$ depends on information from the future with respect to time $s$, and thus cannot be $\\mathcal{F}_s$-measurable. Therefore, for $(B_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ to be adapted to $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$, we must have $T_s \\leq s$ almost surely for all $s\\ge 0$. From the definition of $T_s$, the condition $T_s \\le s$ is equivalent to $[M]_s \\ge s$.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option based on this framework.\n\n**A. In general, $(B_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ does not have independent increments with respect to $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$, because the $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_s$ can strictly contain $\\mathcal{F}_{T_s}$ on events where $T_ss$, thereby including information about the path of $(M_t)_{t\\ge 0}$ over $(T_s,s]$, which can couple with the future increment $M_{T_u}-M_{T_s}=B_u-B_s$ for $us$. Independence of increments for $(B_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ is guaranteed only relative to $(\\mathcal{F}_{T_s})_{s\\ge 0}$.**\n\nThis statement is correct. It precisely identifies the source of the problem. While the comparison of $\\sigma$-algebras \"on events\" is informal, the intuition is sound. Formally, for $r  s$, the increment $B_s - B_r = M_{T_s} - M_{T_r}$ is independent of $\\mathcal{F}_{T_r}$. However, it is not generally independent of $\\mathcal{F}_r$. When the underlying volatility of $M$ is stochastic, the path of $M_t$ up to time $r$ (information in $\\mathcal{F}_r$) provides information about the likely path of $[M]_t$. This information influences the random times $T_s$ and $T_r$, which define the increment. For instance, if $[M]_r  r$, then $T_r  r$. The knowledge of the path of $M_t$ on the interval $(T_r, r]$, which is contained in $\\mathcal{F}_r$ but not in $\\mathcal{F}_{T_r}$, can be correlated with the future behavior of $[M]_t$ and thus with the value of the future increment $B_s - B_r$. The statement that independence is guaranteed with respect to $(\\mathcal{F}_{T_s})_{s\\ge 0}$ is the essence of the DDS theorem.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Independence of increments of $(B_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ with respect to $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ holds if and only if $[M]_t=t$ almost surely, in which case $T_s=s$ almost surely and $B_s=M_s$ is a standard Brownian motion relative to $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ by the Lévy characterization.**\n\nThis statement is correct. It establishes the unique condition under which the time-changed process behaves as a Brownian motion with respect to the original filtration.\n- **If part ($\\Leftarrow$)**: If $[M]_t = t$ a.s. for all $t\\ge 0$, then $T_s = \\inf\\{t\\ge 0 : t  s\\} = s$ a.s. In this case, $B_s = M_{T_s} = M_s$. The process $(B_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ is simply the original process $(M_s)_{s\\ge 0}$. Since $(M_t)_{t\\ge 0}$ is given as a continuous local martingale with $M_0=0$ and $[M]_t=t$, by the Lévy characterization, it is a standard Brownian motion with respect to its own filtration, $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\ge 0}$. Thus, it has independent increments with respect to $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$.\n- **Only if part ($\\Rightarrow$)**: For $(B_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ to have independent increments with respect to $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ (and to be considered a Brownian motion), it must first be adapted to $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$. As established earlier, this requires $T_s \\le s$ a.s. for all $s$, which is equivalent to $[M]_s \\ge s$ a.s. for all $s$. Now consider the independence property itself. For the increment $B_u-B_s = M_{T_u}-M_{T_s}$ to be independent of $\\mathcal{F}_s$ for $us$, any information in $\\mathcal{F}_s$ must be decorrelated from it. However, if $[M]_s  s$ on a set of positive probability, then on this set $T_s  s$. The information in $\\mathcal{F}_s$ about the path of $M_t$ on $(T_s, s]$ will generally be correlated with the subsequent evolution of $[M]_t$ and hence with the times $T_s, T_u$ and the increment $M_{T_u}-M_{T_s}$. For this coupling to be severed for a general continuous local martingale $M$, the time-change must be trivial. This requires that the condition for adaptedness, $[M]_s \\ge s$, must be met with equality, i.e., $[M]_s = s$ a.s. for all $s$.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The optional stopping theorem for $(M_t)_{t\\ge 0}$ at stopping times $T_sT_u$ implies that $M_{T_u}-M_{T_s}$ is independent of $\\mathcal{F}_{T_s}$, which in turn implies independence of $B_u-B_s$ from $\\mathcal{F}_s$; hence independence cannot fail under $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, the optional stopping theorem (or more accurately, the strong Markov property of $M$) implies that $\\mathbb{E}[M_{T_u}-M_{T_s} | \\mathcal{F}_{T_s}] = 0$ (under suitable integrability conditions for $M$, or by localization), not that the increment is independent of $\\mathcal{F}_{T_s}$. The independence is a stronger property that follows from the full DDS theorem. Second, and more critically, even if one grants independence from $\\mathcal{F}_{T_s}$, this does not imply independence from $\\mathcal{F}_s$. As argued in A, $\\mathcal{F}_s$ and $\\mathcal{F}_{T_s}$ are generally different filtrations, and independence with respect to one does not imply independence with respect to the other.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. If one replaces $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ by the completed natural filtration $(\\sigma(B_r:0\\le r\\le s))_{s\\ge 0}$ of $(B_s)_{s\\ge 0}$, the independence of increments is restored; the failure occurs only when one insists on the original filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ rather than the appropriate $(\\mathcal{F}_{T_s})_{s\\ge 0}$ or the natural filtration of $(B_s)_{s\\ge 0}$.**\n\nThis statement is correct. The DDS theorem states that the process $(B_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ *is* a standard Brownian motion. A key part of the definition of a standard Brownian motion is that it has stationary and independent increments. When this is stated without reference to a specific filtration, it is understood to hold with respect to its own natural filtration $(\\mathcal{B}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ where $\\mathcal{B}_s = \\sigma(B_r:0\\le r\\le s)$. The DDS theorem gives a larger filtration, $(\\mathcal{F}_{T_s})_{s\\ge 0}$, with respect to which $(B_s)_{s \\ge 0}$ is a Brownian motion. Since $(\\mathcal{B}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ is a sub-filtration of $(\\mathcal{F}_{T_s})_{s\\ge 0}$, the property also holds for the natural filtration. The statement correctly identifies that the \"failure\" of properties is not intrinsic to the process $(B_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ but is relative to the choice of the filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. If $[M]_t=a(t)$ is a deterministic, strictly increasing function with $a(t)\\neq t$, then $T_s=a^{-1}(s)$ is deterministic, so viewing $(B_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ under $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ still leads to failure of independence of increments, without exception.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because it is too strong and mischaracterizes one of the failure modes. Let $M_t = \\int_0^t \\sqrt{a'(u)} \\, \\mathrm{d}W_u$ for a standard Brownian motion $W$. Then $[M]_t = a(t)$.\nThe increment is $B_u - B_s = M_{a^{-1}(u)} - M_{a^{-1}(s)} = \\int_{a^{-1}(s)}^{a^{-1}(u)} \\sqrt{a'(v)} \\, \\mathrm{d}W_v$.\nThis increment is independent of $\\mathcal{F}_s = \\sigma (W_v : v\\le s)$ if and only if the integration interval $[a^{-1}(s), a^{-1}(u)]$ has no overlap with $[0,s]$, which means $a^{-1}(s) \\ge s$, or equivalently $s \\ge a(s)$.\nConsider the case where $a(t) \\neq t$.\n1. If there exists some $s_0$ such that $a(s_0)  s_0$, then $a^{-1}(s_0)  s_0$. In this case, the process is adapted at $s_0$, but for $us_0$ sufficiently close to $s_0$, the integration interval $[a^{-1}(s_0), a^{-1}(u)]$ overlaps with $[0, s_0]$. Thus, independence of increments fails.\n2. If $a(t)  t$ for all $t0$. For example, let $a(t)=t/2$. Then $a^{-1}(s)=2s$. The condition for independence, $a^{-1}(s) \\ge s$, becomes $2s \\ge s$, which is true for all $s\\ge 0$. So, in this case, the increments *are* independent of $\\mathcal{F}_s$. However, the process $(B_s)_{s\\ge0}$ is not an $(\\mathcal{F}_s)$-Brownian motion because it is not adapted: $T_s = 2s  s$.\nSince the statement claims independence fails \"without exception\" if $a(t)\\neq t$, and we have found a case where it does not fail (but adaptedness does), the statement is false.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "3000830"}, {"introduction": "For a multi-dimensional Brownian motion, the components are independent if and only if they are strongly orthogonal, meaning their quadratic covariation is zero.

A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the relationship between strong orthogonality ($[M,N]_t \\equiv 0$) and independence. For two continuous local martingales $M$ and $N$ that are jointly a Gaussian process (for instance, if they are components of a multidimensional Brownian motion), strong orthogonality is equivalent to independence. The problem asks for examples where this equivalence fails, which occurs when the joint law of $(M,N)$ is not Gaussian. The task is to verify, for each option, three conditions:\n1. $M$ and $N$ are continuous local martingales.\n2. $M$ and $N$ are strongly orthogonal, i.e., $[M,N]_t \\equiv 0$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\n3. $M$ and $N$ are not independent.\n4. The provided justification is correct and invokes non-Gaussianity.\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\n- **Construction**: $M_t := B^1_t$ and $N_t := B^2_{t\\wedge T} = \\int_0^t \\mathbf{1}_{\\{s\\le T\\}}\\,\\mathrm{d}B^2_s$, where $T := \\inf\\{t\\ge 0:\\,B^1_t=1\\}$.\n1. **Continuous Local Martingales**: $M_t = B^1_t$ is a martingale. The stopping time $T$ is an $\\mathcal{F}_t$-stopping time. The process $s \\mapsto \\mathbf{1}_{\\{s\\le T\\}}$ is a left-continuous and adapted, hence predictable, process. Therefore, $N_t$, as a stochastic integral with respect to the Brownian motion $B^2$, is a continuous local martingale.\n2. **Strong Orthogonality**: $M_t = \\int_0^t 1\\,\\mathrm{d}B^1_s$ and $N_t = \\int_0^t \\mathbf{1}_{\\{s\\le T\\}}\\,\\mathrm{d}B^2_s$. Since $B^1$ and $B^2$ are independent standard Brownian motions, their quadratic covariation $[B^1, B^2]_t \\equiv 0$. The quadratic covariation of the stochastic integrals is given by $[M,N]_t = \\int_0^t 1 \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\{s\\le T\\}} \\,\\mathrm{d}[B^1,B^2]_s = 0$. They are strongly orthogonal.\n3. **Independence**: The stopping time $T$ is a functional of the path of $M=B^1$, so $T$ is $\\mathcal{F}_\\infty^M$-measurable. The process $N_t$ is defined using $T$. To show dependence, consider the conditional distribution of $N_t$ given the full history of $M$, i.e., given $\\mathcal{F}_\\infty^M$. Since $T$ is known given $\\mathcal{F}_\\infty^M$, the process $N_t=B^2_{t\\wedge T}$ is a stopped Brownian motion, where the stopping time is fixed. The conditional distribution is Gaussian with mean $0$ and variance $t \\wedge T$. Since $T$ is a non-degenerate random variable (it depends on the path of $B^1$), this conditional variance is random. If $M$ and $N$ were independent, the conditional distribution of $N_t$ given $\\mathcal{F}_\\infty^M$ would be the same as its unconditional distribution, which must have a deterministic variance. The randomness of the conditional variance proves dependence.\n4. **Justification**: The justification provided is entirely correct. It points out that the conditional law of $N_t$ is $\\mathcal{N}(0,t\\wedge T)$, where the variance is the random variable $t\\wedge T$ determined by $M$. This dependence of the conditional variance on $M$ is a hallmark of non-Gaussianity for the joint process $(M_t,N_t)_t$, explaining why zero covariation does not imply independence.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\n- **Construction**: $M_t := B^1_t$ and $N_t := \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sign}(B^1_s)\\,\\mathrm{d}B^2_s$.\n1. **Continuous Local Martingales**: $M_t$ is a martingale. The integrand $H_s = \\operatorname{sign}(B^1_s)$ is a bounded, progressively measurable process. Thus, $N_t$ is a continuous local martingale.\n2. **Strong Orthogonality**: $[M,N]_t = \\int_0^t 1 \\cdot \\operatorname{sign}(B^1_s) \\,\\mathrm{d}[B^1,B^2]_s = 0$ since $[B^1,B^2]_t \\equiv 0$. They are strongly orthogonal.\n3. **Independence**: Let's examine the quadratic variation of $N_t$. $[N,N]_t = \\int_0^t (\\operatorname{sign}(B^1_s))^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}[B^2,B^2]_s = \\int_0^t (\\operatorname{sign}(B^1_s))^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}s$. Since the set of times $\\{s: B^1_s = 0\\}$ has Lebesgue measure $0$ almost surely, $(\\operatorname{sign}(B^1_s))^2=1$ for almost every $s$. Thus, $[N,N]_t = \\int_0^t 1\\,\\mathrm{d}s = t$. We have a two-dimensional continuous local martingale $(M_t, N_t)$ with quadratic variation matrix given by $\\mathrm{d}[M,M]_t = \\mathrm{d}t$, $\\mathrm{d}[N,N]_t = \\mathrm{d}t$, and $\\mathrm{d}[M,N]_t = 0$. By Lévy's characterization of multidimensional Brownian motion, the process $(M,N)$ is a two-dimensional standard Brownian motion. The components of a standard Brownian motion are independent. Therefore, $M$ and $N$ are independent processes.\n4. **Justification**: The claim that $M$ and $N$ are not independent is false. Consequently, the justification is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\n- **Construction**: $M_t := B^1_t$ and $N_t := B^2_t$.\n1. **Continuous Local Martingales**: Yes, by definition.\n2. **Strong Orthogonality**: Yes, $[B^1, B^2]_t \\equiv 0$ by definition of a standard 2D Brownian motion.\n3. **Independence**: Yes, by definition of a standard 2D Brownian motion.\n4. **Justification**: The option correctly states that these processes are strongly orthogonal and independent, and therefore this is not an example of the phenomenon requested. The question asks to choose options that *produce* an example of strongly orthogonal but non-independent martingales. This option explicitly and correctly states it does not.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n- **Construction**: $B$ is a 1D BM, $M_t := B_t$, and $N_t := B_t^3-3\\int_0^t B_s\\,\\mathrm{d}s$.\n1. **Continuous Local Martingales**: $M_t$ is a martingale. For $N_t$, we apply Itō's formula to $f(x)=x^3$. We have $\\mathrm{d}(B_t^3) = 3B_t^2\\,\\mathrm{d}B_t + 3B_t\\,\\mathrm{d}t$. Integrating gives $B_t^3 = \\int_0^t 3B_s^2\\,\\mathrm{d}B_s + \\int_0^t 3B_s\\,\\mathrm{d}s$. Therefore, $N_t = B_t^3-3\\int_0^t B_s\\,\\mathrm{d}s = \\int_0^t 3B_s^2\\,\\mathrm{d}B_s$. This is an Itō integral with respect to $B$ and is a continuous local martingale.\n2. **Strong Orthogonality**: Both $M_t$ and $N_t$ are stochastic integrals with respect to the *same* Brownian motion $B$. $M_t = \\int_0^t 1 \\cdot \\mathrm{d}B_s$ and $N_t = \\int_0^t 3B_s^2 \\cdot \\mathrm{d}B_s$. Their quadratic covariation is $[M,N]_t = \\int_0^t (1)(3B_s^2)\\,\\mathrm{d}[B,B]_s = \\int_0^t 3B_s^2\\,\\mathrm{d}s$. This is not identically zero (a.s. it is strictly positive for $t0$). Therefore, $M$ and $N$ are not strongly orthogonal.\n3. **Independence**: Since they are not strongly orthogonal, this option fails a key requirement. (They are also clearly not independent, as $N$ is constructed directly from $M$).\n4. **Justification**: The claim that they are strongly orthogonal is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option E**\n- **Construction**: $M_t := B^1_t$ and $N_t := \\int_0^t \\mathbf{1}_{\\{B^1_s\\ge 0\\}}\\,\\mathrm{d}B^2_s$.\n1. **Continuous Local Martingales**: $M_t$ is a martingale. The integrand $H_s = \\mathbf{1}_{\\{B^1_s\\ge 0\\}}$ is a bounded, progressively measurable process, so $N_t$ is a continuous local martingale.\n2. **Strong Orthogonality**: As in option A, $M_t$ is an integral w.r.t. $B^1$ and $N_t$ is an integral w.r.t. $B^2$. Since $[B^1, B^2]_t \\equiv 0$, their quadratic covariation $[M,N]_t = \\int_0^t 1 \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\{B^1_s\\ge 0\\}} \\,\\mathrm{d}[B^1,B^2]_s = 0$. They are strongly orthogonal.\n3. **Independence**: The integrand of $N_t$ depends on the path of $M_t = B^1_t$. Let's compute the conditional variance of $N_t$ given the history $\\mathcal{F}^M_\\infty = \\mathcal{F}^{B^1}_\\infty$. By the conditional version of Itō's isometry:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[N_t^2 \\mid \\mathcal{F}^{B^1}_\\infty] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ [N,N]_t \\mid \\mathcal{F}^{B^1}_\\infty \\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\int_0^t (\\mathbf{1}_{\\{B^1_s\\ge 0\\}})^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}s \\mid \\mathcal{F}^{B^1}_\\infty \\right] = \\int_0^t \\mathbf{1}_{\\{B^1_s\\ge 0\\}} \\,\\mathrm{d}s $$\nThis is the occupation time of the positive half-line for the process $B^1$ up to time $t$. By the arcsine laws for Brownian motion, this is a non-degenerate random variable for any $t0$. Since the conditional variance of $N_t$ is a non-constant random variable depending on $M$, the processes $M$ and $N$ are not independent.\n4. **Justification**: The justification correctly identifies the conditional variance as the occupation time, correctly states it's a non-degenerate random variable depending on $M$, and correctly concludes that this implies non-independence and non-Gaussianity.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "2980277"}]}
