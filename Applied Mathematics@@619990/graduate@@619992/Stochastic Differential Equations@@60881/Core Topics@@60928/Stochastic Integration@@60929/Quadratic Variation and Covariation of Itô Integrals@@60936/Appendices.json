The definitions of Brownian motion, Itô processes, quadratic variation, and covariation are all standard and mathematically rigorous.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined and self-contained. The process $X_t$ is specified, and the quantities to be computed, $[X]_t$ and $[X,W]_t$, are well-defined objects in this framework. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists and can be derived from the provided definitions and fundamental principles of stochastic calculus.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, formal mathematical language, free from any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe process $X_t$ is a continuous semimartingale, being the sum of a deterministic process with finite variation and a scaled Brownian motion. We can decompose $X_t$ into two components:\n$1$. A finite-variation process, which we denote by $A_t = b\\,t$. This process has continuous paths and its total variation on $[0,t]$ is $|b|t$, which is finite. This is the drift component of $X_t$.\n$2$. A continuous local martingale, which we denote by $M_t = \\sigma\\,W_t$. This is the martingale component or diffusion component of $X_t$.\nThus, $X_t = A_t + M_t$.\n\nThe quadratic variation and covariation are bilinear operators. We will use this property, along with fundamental properties of these operators with respect to finite-variation processes and martingales.\n\n**Calculation of the Quadratic Variation $[X]_t$**\n\nThe quadratic variation $[X]_t$ is equivalent to the quadratic covariation $[X,X]_t$. Using the decomposition $X_t = A_t + M_t$ and the bilinearity of the covariation bracket:\n$$\n[X]_t = [A_t + M_t, A_t + M_t]_t = [A,A]_t + 2[A,M]_t + [M,M]_t\n$$\nWe analyze each term separately:\n- $[A,A]_t = [A]_t$: This is the quadratic variation of a continuous process with finite variation. Let $\\Pi = \\{0=t_0 < t_1 < \\dots < t_n = t\\}$ be a partition of $[0,t]$. The corresponding sum is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (A_{t_{i+1}} - A_{t_i})^2 = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (b\\,t_{i+1} - b\\,t_i)^2 = b^2 \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (t_{i+1} - t_i)^2\n$$\nLet $\\Delta t_i = t_{i+1} - t_i$. The sum is $b^2 \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (\\Delta t_i)^2$. We have $\\sum_i (\\Delta t_i)^2 \\le (\\max_i \\Delta t_i) \\sum_i \\Delta t_i = \\|\\Pi\\|\\,t$. As the mesh $\\|\\Pi\\| \\to 0$, this sum converges to $0$. Therefore, $[A]_t=0$.\n\n- $[A,M]_t$: This is the quadratic covariation between a continuous finite-variation process and a continuous local martingale. The defining sum is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (A_{t_{i+1}} - A_{t_i})(M_{t_{i+1}} - M_{t_i}) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (b\\,\\Delta t_i)(\\sigma\\,(W_{t_{i+1}} - W_{t_i})) = b\\,\\sigma \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\Delta t_i \\Delta W_i\n$$\nThe limit of this sum as $\\|\\Pi\\| \\to 0$ is $0$ in probability. Thus, $[A,M]_t=0$.\n\n- $[M,M]_t = [M]_t$: This is the quadratic variation of the process $M_t = \\sigma\\,W_t$. Using the scaling property of the quadratic variation, $[\\lambda Y]_t = \\lambda^2 [Y]_t$:\n$$\n[M]_t = [\\sigma W]_t = \\sigma^2 [W]_t\n$$\nA fundamental property of standard one-dimensional Brownian motion is that its quadratic variation is $[W]_t=t$. Therefore, $[M]_t = \\sigma^2 t$.\n\nCombining these results, the quadratic variation of $X_t$ is:\n$$\n[X]_t = 0 + 2(0) + \\sigma^2 t = \\sigma^2 t\n$$\n\n**Calculation of the Quadratic Covariation $[X,W]_t$**\n\nWe again use the decomposition $X_t = A_t + M_t$ and the bilinearity of the covariation bracket:\n$$\n[X,W]_t = [A_t + M_t, W_t]_t = [A,W]_t + [M,W]_t\n$$\n- $[A,W]_t$: This is the quadratic covariation between the continuous finite-variation process $A_t=b\\,t$ and the Brownian motion $W_t$. As established previously for $[A,M]_t$, the quadratic covariation between a continuous finite-variation process and a continuous local martingale is zero. Thus, $[A,W]_t = 0$.\n\n- $[M,W]_t$: This is the quadratic covariation between $M_t = \\sigma\\,W_t$ and $W_t$. Using the bilinearity property:\n$$\n[M,W]_t = [\\sigma W, W]_t = \\sigma [W,W]_t\n$$\nThe quadratic covariation of a process with itself is its quadratic variation, so $[W,W]_t = [W]_t=t$.\nTherefore, $[M,W]_t = \\sigma t$.\n\nCombining these results, the quadratic covariation between $X_t$ and $W_t$ is:\n$$\n[X,W]_t = 0 + \\sigma t = \\sigma t\n$$\n\n**Interpretation of the Covariation Term**\n\nThe quadratic covariation $[X,W]_t = \\sigma t$ quantifies the accumulated covariance of the infinitesimal random innovations of the processes $X_t$ and $W_t$ over the interval $[0,t]$. The stochastic differential of $X_t$ is $dX_t = b\\,dt + \\sigma\\,dW_t$. The coefficient $\\sigma$ determines the magnitude and sign of the influence of the Wiener process increment $dW_t$ on the increment $dX_t$. The quadratic covariation is the integral of the product of the diffusion coefficients of the two processes with respect to their common source of noise. In this case, the diffusion coefficient for $X_t$ is $\\sigma$ and for $W_t$ it is $1$. The rate of change of the covariation, $d[X,W]_t/dt = \\sigma$, is precisely this \"instantaneous noise coupling\" coefficient. If $\\sigma > 0$, the random components of $X_t$ and $W_t$ tend to move in the same direction. If $\\sigma < 0$, they tend to move in opposite directions. If $\\sigma=0$, $X_t$ becomes a deterministic process, $X_t = b\\,t$, and has no random component, resulting in a zero quadratic covariation with $W_t$, indicating no noise coupling.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sigma^2 t & \\sigma t\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2982388"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the previous example, we now move to a more general Itô integral where the integrand is not constant but a function of time.

Itô process $X_t$ defined by\n$$\nX_{t}=\\int_{0}^{t}\\exp(-s)\\,dB_{s}\n$$\nwhere $B_t$ is a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion. The computation must be based on the Itô formula and foundational definitions. We are also asked to prove certain properties of $[X]_t$.\n\nThe differential of the process $X_t$ is given by\n$dX_t = \\exp(-t)\\,dB_t$.\nThis is an Itô process with zero drift and a volatility term of $\\exp(-t)$. According to the problem statement, we must derive its quadratic variation $[X]_t$ using the Itô formula, rather than directly applying the standard result for Itô integrals.\n\nA standard method to achieve this is to define an auxiliary process and compute its differential in two different ways, then equate the results. Let us define the process $Y_t$ as\n$Y_t = \\exp(t) X_t$.\nWe can compute the differential $dY_t$ using the Itô product rule, which is a specific application of the Itô formula for a function $f(u,v)=uv$. Let $u(t) = \\exp(t)$. Then $dY_t = d(u(t)X_t)$ is given by\n$dY_t = (du(t))X_t + u(t)dX_t + d[u, X]_t$.\nSince $u(t) = \\exp(t)$ is a deterministic, continuously differentiable function, its differential is $du(t) = \\exp(t)dt$. As a process of finite variation, its quadratic variation is zero, and its covariation with any continuous local martingale $X_t$ is also zero. Thus, $d[u, X]_t = 0$.\nSubstituting the known terms, we get\n$dY_t = (\\exp(t)dt)X_t + \\exp(t)(\\exp(-t)dB_t) = \\exp(t)X_t dt + dB_t$.\nThis expression gives the stochastic differential equation (SDE) for $Y_t$. It shows that $Y_t$ is an Itô process with drift coefficient $a_t = \\exp(t)X_t$ and diffusion coefficient $b_t = 1$. The quadratic variation of such a process is given by $d[Y]_t = b_t^2 d[B]_t$. Since $B_t$ is a standard Brownian motion, $[B]_t = t$, so $d[B]_t = dt$. Therefore,\n$d[Y]_t = 1^2 dt = dt$.\nIntegrating from $0$ to $t$ and noting that $Y_0 = \\exp(0)X_0 = 0$, we find that the quadratic variation of $Y_t$ is simply\n$[Y]_t = t$.\nNow, we will compute the differential of $Y_t^2$ in two ways.\n\nFirst, applying Itô's formula for the function $f(y) = y^2$ to the process $Y_t$:\n$$\nd(Y_t^2) = 2Y_t dY_t + d[Y]_t.\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $dY_t$ and $d[Y]_t$:\n$$\nd(Y_t^2) = 2Y_t(\\exp(t)X_t dt + dB_t) + dt.\n$$\nSubstitute $Y_t = \\exp(t)X_t$:\n$$\nd(Y_t^2) = 2\\exp(t)X_t(\\exp(t)X_t dt + dB_t) + dt = 2\\exp(2t)X_t^2 dt + 2\\exp(t)X_t dB_t + dt.\n$$\nThis gives us our first expression for $d(Y_t^2)$. It is a semimartingale with a martingale part $2\\exp(t)X_t dB_t$ and a finite variation part $(2\\exp(2t)X_t^2 + 1)dt$. Both integrands are predictable processes since $X_t$ is continuous and adapted.\n\nSecond, we express $Y_t^2$ in terms of $X_t$ directly: $Y_t^2 = (\\exp(t)X_t)^2 = \\exp(2t)X_t^2$. We apply Itô's formula for a time-dependent function $f(t,x) = \\exp(2t)x^2$ to the process $X_t$. The general formula is\n$$\nd f(t, X_t) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}dt + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}dX_t + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}d[X]_t.\n$$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}(t,x) = 2\\exp(2t)x^2, \\quad \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(t,x) = 2\\exp(2t)x, \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}(t,x) = 2\\exp(2t).\n$$\nSubstituting these into the formula, with $x=X_t$ and $dX_t = \\exp(-t)dB_t$:\n$$\nd(Y_t^2) = d(\\exp(2t)X_t^2) = 2\\exp(2t)X_t^2 dt + 2\\exp(2t)X_t dX_t + \\frac{1}{2}(2\\exp(2t))d[X]_t\n$$\n$$\nd(Y_t^2) = 2\\exp(2t)X_t^2 dt + 2\\exp(2t)X_t (\\exp(-t)dB_t) + \\exp(2t)d[X]_t\n$$\n$$\nd(Y_t^2) = 2\\exp(2t)X_t^2 dt + 2\\exp(t)X_t dB_t + \\exp(2t)d[X]_t.\n$$\nThis gives our second expression for $d(Y_t^2)$.\n\nBy the uniqueness of the decomposition of a semimartingale into a local martingale and a predictable finite-variation process, the two expressions for $d(Y_t^2)$ must be equal.\n$$\n(2\\exp(2t)X_t^2 + 1)dt + 2\\exp(t)X_t dB_t = (2\\exp(2t)X_t^2 dt + \\exp(2t)d[X]_t) + 2\\exp(t)X_t dB_t.\n$$\nThe local martingale parts are identical.
