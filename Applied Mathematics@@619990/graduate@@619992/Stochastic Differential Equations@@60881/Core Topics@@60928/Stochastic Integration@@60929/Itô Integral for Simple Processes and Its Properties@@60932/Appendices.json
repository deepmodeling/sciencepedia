It presents a standard, fundamental question in the theory of stochastic integration concerning the definition of predictable processes. All terms are standard and defined precisely. The setup is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities. The problem probes the subtle but critical difference between adaptedness and predictability.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation and Option Analysis**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the definition of a predictable process. A process $H$ is predictable if it is measurable with respect to the predictable $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{P}$. The problem states that $\\mathcal{P}$ is generated by sets of the form $(s,t]\\times A$ where $0\\le s<t\\le T$ and $A\\in\\mathcal{F}_s$, along with sets $\\{0\\}\\times A_0$ where $A_0\\in\\mathcal{F}_0$. These generating sets are called predictable rectangles.\n\nLet us analyze the measurability of the two families of processes.\n\n**1. Analysis of the right-closed family $H^{\\mathrm{rc}}(t,\\omega)$**\nThe process is $H^{\\mathrm{rc}}(t,\\omega)=\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\\xi_k(\\omega)\\,\\mathbf{1}_{(t_k,t_{k+1}]}(t)$. Since a finite sum of measurable functions is measurable, we only need to analyze a single term, say $H_k(t,\\omega) = \\xi_k(\\omega)\\,\\mathbf{1}_{(t_k,t_{k+1}]}(t)$, for a fixed $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, n-1\\}$.\n\nTo check if $H_k$ is $\\mathcal{P}$-measurable, we must verify that for any Borel set $B \\subset \\mathbb{R}$, the preimage set $\\{(t,\\omega) : H_k(t,\\omega) \\in B\\}$ belongs to $\\mathcal{P}$.\nThis preimage is $\\{(t,\\omega) : t \\in (t_k, t_{k+1}] \\text{ and } \\xi_k(\\omega) \\in B \\}$. Let $A = \\{\\omega : \\xi_k(\\omega) \\in B\\}$. Since $\\xi_k$ is given to be $\\mathcal{F}_{t_k}$-measurable, the set $A$ is in $\\mathcal{F}_{t_k}$.\nThe preimage set is therefore $(t_k, t_{k+1}] \\times A$.\nBy the definition of $\\mathcal{P}$, this is a predictable rectangle (with $s=t_k$ and $t=t_{k+1}$), and thus an element of $\\mathcal{P}$.\nHence, each term $H_k$ is predictable, and their sum $H^{\\mathrm{rc}}$ is predictable.\nThis construction is fundamental: the value of the process at any time $t \\in (t_k, t_{k+1}]$ is given by $\\xi_k$, a random variable whose value is \"known\" at time $t_k < t$. This aligns with the intuition of predictability.\n\n**2. Analysis of the left-closed family $H^{\\mathrm{lc}}(t,\\omega)$**\nThe process is $H^{\\mathrm{lc}}(t,\\omega)=\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\\xi_k(\\omega)\\,\\mathbf{1}_{[t_k,t_{k+1})}(t)$. Again, we analyze a single term $H'_k(t,\\omega) = \\xi_k(\\omega)\\,\\mathbf{1}_{[t_k,t_{k+1})}(t)$.\nThe preimage set is $\\{(t,\\omega) : t \\in [t_k, t_{k+1}) \\text{ and } \\xi_k(\\omega) \\in B \\}$. With $A = \\{\\omega : \\xi_k(\\omega) \\in B\\} \\in \\mathcal{F}_{t_k}$ as before, this set is $[t_k, t_{k+1}) \\times A$.\nWe can decompose this set as:\n$$[t_k, t_{k+1}) \\times A = (\\{t_k\\} \\times A) \\cup ((t_k, t_{k+1}) \\times A)$$\nThe second part, $(t_k, t_{k+1}) \\times A$, is predictable because it can be written as a countable union of predictable rectangles, $\\bigcup_{m=1}^{\\infty} (t_k, t_{k+1}-1/m] \\times A$.\nThe first part, $\\{t_k\\} \\times A$, is more problematic. For $t_k > 0$, the set $\\{t_k\\} \\times A$ is predictable if and only if $A \\in \\mathcal{F}_{t_k-}$, where $\\mathcal{F}_{t_k-} = \\sigma(\\bigcup_{s<t_k} \\mathcal{F}_s)$ is the pre-$t_k$ sigma-algebra.\nThe problem only assumes $\\xi_k$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{t_k}$-measurable, which implies $A \\in \\mathcal{F}_{t_k}$. In general, $\\mathcal{F}_{t_k-} \\subsetneq \\mathcal{F}_{t_k}$ (for example, in a filtration generated by a process with a jump at $t_k$). Therefore, merely knowing $A \\in \\mathcal{F}_{t_k}$ is not sufficient to conclude that $\\{t_k\\} \\times A$ is predictable.\nConsequently, $H^{\\mathrm{lc}}$ is not guaranteed to be a predictable process. It is, however, an adapted process, because for any $t \\in [t_k, t_{k+1})$, its value $H^{\\mathrm{lc}}_t = \\xi_k$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{t_k}$-measurable and thus $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Using $(t_k,t_{k+1}]$ ensures that for each $k$ and all $t\\in(t_k,t_{k+1}]$, the value $H^{\\mathrm{rc}}_t=\\xi_k$ is already determined at time $t_k$, i.e., $\\xi_k$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{t_k}$-measurable and hence $\\sigma(\\mathcal{F}_s:s\\le t)$-measurable for all $t\\in(t_k,t_{k+1}]$, which makes $H^{\\mathrm{rc}}$ predictable. If one instead uses $[t_k,t_{k+1})$, then predictability at the left endpoint $t_k$ would require $\\xi_k$ to be $\\mathcalF}_{t_k-}$-measurable; mere $\\mathcal{F}_{t_k}$-measurability is not sufficient in general.**\nThis statement is a precise and accurate summary of the analysis above. The process $H^{\\mathrm{rc}}$ is constructed from predictable rectangles. The process $H^{\\mathrm{lc}}$ has a potential measurability issue at the left endpoint $t_k$ unless the coefficient $\\xi_k$ satisfies the stronger condition of being $\\mathcal{F}_{t_k-}$-measurable. The statement correctly identifies this critical distinction.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. With the left-closed choice $[t_k,t_{k+1})$, the process $H^{\\mathrm{lc}}$ remains predictable as long as $\\xi_k$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{t_k}$-measurable, because predictability only encodes right-continuity in time.**\nThis statement is incorrect on two counts. First, as shown in our analysis, $H^{\\mathrm{lc}}$ is not necessarily predictable under the given conditions. Second, predictability is fundamentally associated with left-continuity, not right-continuity. The predictable $\\sigma$-algebra can be characterized as the one generated by all left-continuous adapted processes.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The predictable $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{P}$ is designed to make left-continuous adapted processes measurable. Step processes that are constant on time-slabs of the form $(t_k,t_{k+1}]$ with $\\mathcal{F}_{t_k}$-measurable coefficients are left-continuous and adapted, hence $\\mathcal{P}$-measurable. In contrast, step processes built from $[t_k,t_{k+1})$ and merely $\\mathcal{F}_{t_k}$-measurable coefficients are typically right-continuous adapted and need not be $\\mathcal{P}$-measurable.**\nThis statement provides an alternative, correct perspective based on path properties. It is a fundamental result that $\\mathcal{P}$ is the $\\sigma$-algebra generated by all left-continuous adapted processes. The process $H^{\\mathrm{rc}}$ is indeed left-continuous and adapted, and therefore predictable. The process $H^{\\mathrm{lc}}$ is right-continuous and adapted. A right-continuous adapted process is not necessarily predictable, which is the key issue. This statement correctly aligns the interval choices with path properties and their implications for predictability.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. The distinction between $(t_k,t_{k+1}]$ and $[t_k,t_{k+1})$ is immaterial for predictability because the endpoints $\\{t_k\\}$ are countable, hence negligible with respect to Brownian paths with probability one.**\nThis reasoning is flawed. The issue is one of measurability with respect to the filtration, not integrability with respect to Lebesgue measure on the time axis. The definition of the Itô integral and the class of valid integrands (predictable processes) is a delicate matter of information flow over time. The properties at individual time points, particularly the left endpoints of intervals, are crucial for distinguishing predictability from adaptedness. Confusing this with measure-theoretic negligibility is a conceptual error.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. If one defined the stochastic integral on left-closed step processes with $\\mathcal{F}_{t_k}$-measurable coefficients, then even for Brownian motion the Itô isometry could fail in general, so the right-closed convention is necessary to ensure the isometry.**\nThis statement is false. The Itô isometry holds for simple adapted processes, which are precisely of the form $H^{\\mathrm{lc}}$. Let $I(H) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\\xi_k(W_{t_{k+1}}-W_{t_k})$. The Itô isometry is the property $\\mathbb{E}[(I(H))^2] = \\mathbb{E}[\\int_0^T H_t^2 dt]$.\nFor $H=H^{\\mathrm{lc}}$, we have $\\mathbb{E}[\\int_0^T (H^{\\mathrm{lc}}_t)^2 dt] = \\mathbb{E}[\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\xi_k^2 (t_{k+1}-t_k)] = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (t_{k+1}-t_k) \\mathbb{E}[\\xi_k^2]$.\nFor the integral's second moment, the key steps rely on the orthogonality of increments $\\mathbb{E}[(W_{t_{k+1}}-W_{t_k})(W_{t_{j+1}}-W_{t_j})|\\mathcal{F}_{t_j}] = 0$ for $j<k$, and the fact that $\\xi_k$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{t_k}$-measurable and $(W_{t_{k+1}}-W_{t_k})$ is independent of $\\mathcal{F}_{t_k}$. This leads to $\\mathbb{E}[(I(H^{\\mathrm{lc}}))^2] = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\mathbb{E}[\\xi_k^2(W_{t_{k+1}}-W_{t_k})^2] = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\mathbb{E}[\\xi_k^2]\\mathbb{E}[(W_{t_{k+1}}-W_{t_k})^2] = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (t_{k+1}-t_k) \\mathbb{E}[\\xi_k^2]$.\nThe isometry holds perfectly. The choice of predictable processes as the class of integrands is motivated by the desire for the stochastic integral to be a martingale (for bounded integrands), which requires predictability, not just adaptedness. The isometry itself is established on the simpler class of adapted step processes and then extended.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2982008"}, {"introduction": "Having established the structure of simple predictable integrands, we now investigate their uniqueness.

Since $H$ and $G$ are simple predictable processes and the coefficients $K_i$ are in $L^2(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}_{t_{i-1}}, \\mathbb{P})$, their Itô integrals are well-defined continuous martingales.\n\nTo show that the processes $\\{I_H(t)\\}_{t \\in [0,T]}$ and $\\{I_G(t)\\}_{t \\in [0,T]}$ are indistinguishable, we must show that $\\mathbb{P}(I_H(t) = I_G(t) \\text{ for all } t\\in[0,T]) = 1$.\nConsider the difference process $D(t) = I_H(t) - I_G(t)$. By the linearity of the Itô integral,\n$$\nD(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\big(H(s,\\omega) - G(s,\\omega)\\big) \\,dW_{s}\n$$\n$D(t)$ is a continuous martingale with $D(0)=0$. We will show that $D(t)=0$ for all $t \\in [0,T]$ almost surely.\nA core property of the Itô integral is that if two integrands are equal almost everywhere with respect to $\\mathbb{P}\\otimes dt$, their Itô integrals are indistinguishable. We have already shown that $H$ and $G$ are equal a.e. in Task 2.\nTo demonstrate this from the core properties listed, we use the $L^2$-isometry. For any fixed $t \\in [0,T]$, the isometry states:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[D(t)^2\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\int_{0}^{t} \\big(H(s) - G(s)\\big) \\,dW_{s}\\right)^2\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{t} \\big(H(s) - G(s)\\big)^2 \\,ds\\right]\n$$\nBy Fubini's theorem (since the integrand is non-negative), we can swap the expectation and integral:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[D(t)^2\\right] = \\int_{0}^{t} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\big(H(s) - G(s)\\big)^2\\right] \\,ds\n$$\nAs established in Task 2, $H(s) - G(s) = 0$ for all $s \\in (0,T]$. At $s=0$, $H(0) - G(0) = -Z(\\omega)$. The integrand of the time integral, $\\mathbb{E}[(H(s)-G(s))^2]$, is $0$ for all $s \\in (0,t]$. The Lebesgue integral over $[0,t]$ is therefore $0$, as the value at a single point does not contribute to the integral.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\big(H(s) - G(s)\\big)^2\\right] \\,ds = \\int_{0}^{t} 0 \\,ds = 0\n$$\nSo, for any $t \\in [0,T]$, $\\mathbb{E}[D(t)^2] = 0$. This implies that $D(t) = 0$ almost surely for each fixed $t$.\nTo establish indistinguishability, we use the fact that $D(t)$ is a continuous process. A continuous process that is zero at every fixed time $t$ with probability $1$ is indistinguishable from the zero process.\nFormally, let $Q = [0,T] \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$ be the set of rational numbers in the interval. The event \"there exists $t \\in [0,T]$ such that $D(t) \\neq 0$\" is, by continuity, the same as \"there exists $q \\in Q$ such that $D(q) \\neq 0$\".\nLet $E_q = \\{\\omega \\mid D(q,\\omega) \\neq 0\\}$. We have shown $\\mathbb{P}(E_q) = 0$ for each $q$. The union $E = \\cup_{q \\in Q} E_q$ is a countable union of null sets, and thus is a null set: $\\mathbb{P}(E)=0$.\nThis means $\\mathbb{P}(D(q)=0 \\text{ for all } q \\in Q)=1$. By the continuity of the sample paths of $D(t)$, if a path is zero on the dense set $Q$, it must be zero for all $t \\in [0,T]$.\nTherefore, $\\mathbb{P}(D(t)=0 \\text{ for all } t \\in [0,T]) = 1$. This shows that the processes $\\{I_H(t)\\}$ and $\\{I_G(t)\\}$ are indistinguishable.\n\n**Task 4: Compute the quantity.**\n\nWe are asked to compute\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\left(\\int_{0}^{T}\\big(H(s,\\omega)-G(s,\\omega)\\big)\\,dW_{s}\\right)^{2}\\right]\n$$\nThis is precisely the expression for $\\mathbb{E}[D(T)^2]$ derived in Task 3. Using the $L^2$-isometry property of the Itô integral:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\left(\\int_{0}^{T}\\big(H(s)-G(s)\\big)\\,dW_{s}\\right)^{2}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\int_{0}^{T}\\big(H(s)-G(s)\\big)^{2}\\,ds\\right]\n$$\nWe analyze the integrand of the time integral, $(H(s)-G(s))^2$.\nFor any $s \\in (0, T]$, we have $H(s)=K(s)$ and $G(s)=K(s)$, so $(H(s)-G(s))^2 = 0$.\nAt $s=0$, we have $H(0)=0$ and $G(0)=Z(\\omega)$, so $(H(0)-G(0))^2 = (-Z(\\omega))^2 = Z(\\omega)^2 = (\\mathbf{1}_A(\\omega))^2 = \\mathbf{1}_A(\\omega)$.\nSo, for any given $\\omega \\in \\Omega$, the integrand as a function of time is:\n$$\nf(s) = \\big(H(s,\\omega)-G(s,\\omega)\\big)^{2} = \\begin{cases} \\mathbf{1}_A(\\omega), & s=0 \\\\ 0, & s \\in (0,T] \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_{0}^{T} f(s) \\,ds$ is a Lebesgue integral with respect to time $s$. The integrand is non-zero only at the single point $s=0$. A set containing a single point has Lebesgue measure zero.

The definition of the Itô integral is directly applicable. All conditions are consistent and sufficient for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n**Step 2: Derivation of the Itô Integral**\nThe process $H_s$ is a simple predictable process. A general simple process is of the form $\\phi_t = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} E_k \\mathbf{1}_{(t_k, t_{k+1}]}(t)$, where each $E_k$ is an $\\mathcal{F}_{t_k}$-measurable random variable. The Itô integral is defined as $\\int_0^T \\phi_t \\, dW_t = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} E_k (W_{t_{k+1}} - W_{t_k})$.\n\nIn this problem, the process $H_s$ corresponds to the case with a single time interval $(0, T]$. We can write $H_s = E \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{(0,T]}(s)$, where the random variable $E$ is given by\n$$\nE = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} a_{j}\\,\\mathbf{1}_{A_{j}}.\n$$\nSince each event $A_j$ is in the initial $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_0$, the random variable $E$ is $\\mathcal{F}_0$-measurable.\n\nApplying the definition of the Itô integral for simple processes, we get:\n$$\nI = \\int_{0}^{T} H_{s}\\,dW_{s} = E \\cdot (W_T - W_0).\n$$\nBy the properties of standard Brownian motion, $W_0 = 0$. Thus, the integral simplifies to:\n$$\nI = E \\cdot W_T = \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{m} a_{j}\\,\\mathbf{1}_{A_{j}}\\right) W_T.\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Derivation of the Probability Density Function**\nTo find the unconditional PDF of $I$, denoted $f_I(x)$, we will use the law of total probability, conditioning on the partition $\\{A_1, \\dots, A_m\\}$. The sets $\\{A_j\\}_{j=1}^m$ form a partition of $\\Omega$, so for any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the PDF can be expressed as:\n$$\nf_I(x) = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} f_{I|A_j}(x) \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(A_j)\n$$\nwhere $f_{I|A_j}(x)$ is the conditional PDF of $I$ given the event $A_j$, and $\\mathbb{P}(A_j) = p_j$.\n\nLet us determine the conditional distribution of $I$ given $A_j$. When we condition on the event $A_j$, the indicator function $\\mathbf{1}_{A_j}$ becomes $1$, and $\\mathbf{1}_{A_k}$ becomes $0$ for all $k \\neq j$. Therefore, the random variable $E$ takes the constant value $a_j$:\n$$\nE \\big|_{A_j} = a_j.\n$$\nConsequently, the conditional random variable $I$ given $A_j$ is:\n$$\nI \\big|_{A_j} = a_j W_T.\n$$\nA standard Brownian motion $W_T$ at time $T$ follows a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $T$, i.e., $W_T \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, T)$.\nThe random variable $E$ is $\\mathcal{F}_0$-measurable, while the increment $W_T = W_T - W_0$ is independent of the $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_0$. Thus, $E$ and $W_T$ are independent random variables.\n\nFor a normally distributed random variable $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ and a constant $c$, the scaled variable $cX$ is distributed as $c X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(c\\mu, c^2\\sigma^2)$. Applying this property to $I \\big|_{A_j} = a_j W_T$, we have:\n$$\nI \\big|_{A_j} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(a_j \\cdot 0, a_j^2 T) = \\mathcal{N}(0, a_j^2 T).\n$$\nThe constants $a_j$ are non-zero, so the variance $a_j^2 T$ is strictly positive.\n\nThe PDF of a normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ is given by $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$.
