The process is commonly known as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The state space is given as $(l,r) = (-\\infty, +\\infty)$. The derivation must start from the fundamental definition of the scale function $s(x)$ as a solution to the differential equation $L s(x) = 0$, where $L$ is the infinitesimal generator of the process $X_t$.\n\nThe infinitesimal generator $L$ is given by $L f(x)=\\mu(x) f'(x)+\\tfrac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}(x) f''(x)$.\nSubstituting the given coefficients $\\mu(x)=\\alpha x$ and $\\sigma(x)=\\sigma$ into the generator expression, we get:\n$$L f(x) = (\\alpha x) f'(x) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 f''(x)$$\nThe scale function $s(x)$ must satisfy the equation $L s(x) = 0$.

Let $v(x) = s'(x)$. The ODE becomes a first-order ODE for $v(x)$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 v'(x) + (\\alpha x) v(x) = 0$$\nThis equation is separable:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 \\frac{dv}{dx} = -\\alpha x v$$\n$$\\frac{dv}{v} = -\\frac{2\\alpha x}{\\sigma^2} dx$$\nIntegrating both sides, we obtain:\n$$\\int \\frac{1}{v} dv = \\int -\\frac{2\\alpha x}{\\sigma^2} dx$$\n$$\\ln|v(x)| = -\\frac{\\alpha x^2}{\\sigma^2} + C_1$$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration.

Since $v(x) = s'(x)$, we have:\n$$s'(x) = K \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha x^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right)$$\nTo find $s(x)$, we integrate $s'(x)$ with respect to $x$.

The Speed Measure Density and Integral**\nThe speed measure density $m(x)$ is defined by the relation $m(x) = \\frac{2}{\\sigma^2 s'(x)}$.\nUsing $s'(x) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} x\\right)$, we find:\n$$\nm(x) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} x\\right)} = \\frac{2}{\\sigma^2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} x\\right)\n$$\nNext, we compute the total speed measure on $(0, \\infty)$, $M(\\infty) = \\int_0^\\infty m(x) \\mathrm{d}x$:\n$$\nM(\\infty) = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{2}{\\sigma^2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} x\\right) \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nThe convergence of this integral depends on the sign of the exponent's coefficient $\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2}$, which has the same sign as $\\mu$.\n\nCase 1: $\\mu \\ge 0$. The exponent is non-negative, so the integrand is non-decaying. The integral diverges: $M(\\infty) = \\infty$.\n\nCase 2: $\\mu < 0$. The exponent is negative, so the integral converges.\n$$\nM(\\infty) = \\frac{2}{\\sigma^2} \\left[ \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\mu} \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} x\\right) \\right]_0^\\infty = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\left[ \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} x\\right) - \\exp(0) \\right] = \\frac{1}{\\mu} (0 - 1) = -\\frac{1}{\\mu}\n$$\nIn summary, $M(\\infty)$ is infinite if $\\mu \\ge 0$ and finite if $\\mu < 0$. The value for $\\mu < 0$ is $-\\frac{1}{\\mu}$.\n\n**4. Boundary Classification at $\\infty$**\nThe classification of the boundary at $\\infty$ depends on two key properties derived from the scale function and speed measure: the finiteness of the scale distance to the boundary, and the integrability of certain functions involving $s(x)$ and $m(x)$ near the boundary. A boundary $r$ is **attainable** if and only if the scale distance to it is finite, i.e., $s(r)  \\infty$.\n\n**Case 1: $\\mu > 0$**\n- **Attainability**: We found $s(\\infty) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\mu}$, which is finite. A finite scale distance implies the boundary is **attainable**.\n- **Classification**: For an attainable boundary, we must distinguish between regular (a two-way passage) and exit (a one-way trip). This is determined by the convergence of $\\int_c^\\infty s(x)m(x) \\mathrm{d}x$ for some $c \\in (0, \\infty)$. The integrand is:\n$$ s(x)m(x) = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} x\\right) - 1\\right) $$\nSince $\\mu > 0$, this integrand grows exponentially, so the integral diverges. An attainable boundary where this integral diverges is an **exit** boundary. The problem also asks to evaluate $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\bigl(s(\\infty)-s(x)\\bigr)\\,m(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x$. The integrand is $(s(\\infty) - s(x))m(x) = \\frac{1}{\\mu}$, so the integral is $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\mathrm{d}x = \\infty$. This divergence is consistent with an exit classification.\n\n**Case 2: $\\mu  0$**\n- **Attainability**: We found $s(\\infty) = \\infty$. An infinite scale distance implies the boundary is **unattainable**.\n- **Classification**: For an unattainable boundary, we must distinguish between entrance and natural. This is determined by the convergence of the speed measure integral $\\int_c^\\infty m(x) \\mathrm{d}x$. From part 3, the total speed measure $M(\\infty) = \\int_0^\\infty m(x) \\mathrm{d}x = -1/\\mu$ is finite. An unattainable boundary with a finite speed measure integral is an **entrance** boundary.\n\n**Case 3: $\\mu = 0$**\n- **Attainability**: We found $s(\\infty) = \\infty$. The boundary is **unattainable**.\n- **Classification**: The speed measure is $m(x) = 2/\\sigma^2$, so the integral $\\int_c^\\infty m(x) \\mathrm{d}x$ diverges. An unattainable boundary with a divergent speed measure integral is a **natural** boundary.\n\n**Summary of the effect of the sign of $\\mu$:**\n- For $\\mu > 0$, the positive drift pushes the process towards $\\infty$. The boundary is **exit**.\n- For $\\mu  0$, the negative drift pulls the process away from $\\infty$. The boundary is **entrance**.\n- For $\\mu = 0$, the boundary at $\\infty$ is **natural**.\n\nThe final calculation required is the value of the speed measure integral $M(\\infty)$ for $\\mu0$. As derived in part 3, this value is $-\\frac{1}{\\mu}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{\\mu}}$$", "id": "2970110"}]}
