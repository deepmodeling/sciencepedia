The concepts of SDEs, infinitesimal generators, and scale functions are standard in the theory of stochastic processes. The given SDE is a general one-dimensional Itô diffusion. The assumptions on the coefficients are common. The question is a well-posed query about the definition and properties of the scale function. No inconsistencies, ambiguities, or factual errors are present in the problem setup.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to derive the solution and evaluate the options.\n\n**Derivation of the Scale Function**\nLet $s(x)$ be a twice continuously differentiable function. We want to find the condition on $s$ such that the transformed process $Z_t = s(X_t)$ has zero drift, i.e., it is a local martingale. We apply Itô's formula to $Z_t$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}Z_t = s'(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}X_t + \\frac{1}{2} s''(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\langle X \\rangle_t\n$$\nSubstituting $\\mathrm{d}X_t = b(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$ and the quadratic variation $\\mathrm{d}\\langle X \\rangle_t = \\sigma^2(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t$, we get:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}Z_t = s'(X_t) \\left( b(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t \\right) + \\frac{1}{2} s''(X_t) \\sigma^2(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nGrouping the $\\mathrm{d}t$ and $\\mathrm{d}W_t$ terms:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}Z_t = \\left( b(X_t)s'(X_t) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2(X_t)s''(X_t) \\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}t + s'(X_t)\\sigma(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t\n$$\nThe expression in the parenthesis is precisely the action of the generator $L$ on the function $s$, evaluated at $X_t$: $L s(X_t)$. For $Z_t$ to be a local martingale, its drift term (the coefficient of $\\mathrm{d}t$) must be zero. Therefore, the scale function $s(x)$ must be a solution to the second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\nL s(x) = b(x)s'(x) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2(x)s''(x) = 0\n$$\nTo solve this ODE, let $u(x) = s'(x)$. The equation becomes a first-order linear ODE for $u(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2(x) u'(x) = -b(x)u(x) \\implies \\frac{u'(x)}{u(x)} = -\\frac{2b(x)}{\\sigma^2(x)}\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from a reference point $x_*$ to $x$ gives:\n$$\n\\ln(u(x)) - \\ln(u(x_*)) = -\\int_{x_*}^x \\frac{2b(y)}{\\sigma^2(y)}\\,\\mathrm{d}y\n$$\n$$\nu(x) = u(x_*) \\exp\\left(-\\int_{x_*}^x \\frac{2b(y)}{\\sigma^2(y)}\\,\\mathrm{d}y\\right)\n$$\nSetting the integration constant $u(x_*) = s'(x_*)$ to 1 for simplicity (any positive constant will do), we have:\n$$\ns'(x) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_{x_*}^x \\frac{2b(y)}{\\sigma^2(y)}\\,\\mathrm{d}y\\right)\n$$\nSince $\\sigma(x)>0$ is given, $\\sigma^2(x)>0$. The exponential function is always positive, so $s'(x) > 0$ for all $x$. This implies that $s(x)$ is a strictly increasing function, confirming its description as \"strictly monotone\". The function $s(x)$ itself is found by integrating $s'(x)$, typically with a normalization like $s(x_*) = 0$:\n$$\ns(x) = \\int_{x_*}^x s'(y)\\,\\mathrm{d}y\n$$\nWith $L s = 0$, the SDE for $Z_t = s(X_t)$ becomes:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}Z_t = s'(X_t)\\sigma(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t\n$$\nThis confirms that $Z_t$ is a local martingale. The scale function transforms the original process $X_t$ into a driftless process, which is a (time-changed) Brownian motion.\n\nNow we evaluate each option.\n\n**Option A Evaluation**\nThis option states that the scale function $s$ is a strictly increasing solution of $L s=0$, provides the correct integral form for $s'(x)$, and correctly states the SDE for the transformed process $Z_t=s(X_t)$. It correctly identifies $Z_t$ as a driftless local martingale. It also correctly notes that since $s$ is strictly increasing, it preserves pathwise order (i.e., if $x_1 \\le x_2$, then $s(x_1) \\le s(x_2)$). Finally, it accurately describes the utility of this transformation in comparison arguments, where removing the drift simplifies the problem to comparing two local martingales, a standard technique in SDE theory often involving Tanaka's formula or related martingale methods. All parts of this statement are correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B Evaluation**\nThis option claims the scale function is defined by $s'(x)=\\sigma^{-2}(x)$. This is incorrect. The correct condition for the scale function is $L s = 0$, and its derivative $s'(x)$ is given by the exponential formula derived above, which is not generally equal to $\\sigma^{-2}(x)$. Furthermore, it claims this transformation leads to a unit diffusion coefficient for $Z_t$. The diffusion coefficient of $Z_t$ is $s'(X_t)\\sigma(X_t)$. If $s'(x) = \\sigma^{-2}(x)$, the diffusion coefficient would be $\\sigma^{-2}(X_t)\\sigma(X_t) = \\sigma^{-1}(X_t)$, which is not unity in general. In fact, a different transformation, known as the Lamperti transform, defined by $s'(x) = \\sigma^{-1}(x)$, is used to obtain a unit diffusion coefficient. The statement confuses the scale function with another concept and incorrectly computes the resulting diffusion coefficient.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C Evaluation**\nThis option claims that the transformation $Z_t=s(X_t)$ is not suitable for comparison because $s$ is not monotone. As we derived, $s'(x)$ is strictly positive for a suitable choice of integration constant, which means $s(x)$ is strictly monotone (specifically, strictly increasing). Therefore, the premise \"s is not monotone\" is false. The conclusion that it is \"not suitable for comparison\" is also false; its primary purpose is precisely to facilitate comparison arguments.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option D Evaluation**\nThis option correctly states the SDE for the transformed processes and that their difference is a local martingale (has zero drift). The claim that the local time of the difference at zero is \"vanishing\" is also correct, as the diffusion of the difference process is zero at contact. However, the final part of the statement claims this implies order preservation \"for all initial conditions\". This is a critical error. Comparison principles guarantee the *preservation* of an initial order (e.g., if $X_0^{(1)} \\le X_0^{(2)}$), not the creation of a specific order regardless of the starting configuration. Therefore, the statement is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option E Evaluation**\nThis option claims the utility of the scale function is making the diffusion coefficient constant. As shown in the derivation, the diffusion coefficient of the transformed process $Z_t$ is $s'(X_t)\\sigma(X_t)$. Using the expression for $s'(x)$, this is $\\exp(-\\int_{x_*}^x \\frac{2b(y)}{\\sigma^2(y)}\\,\\mathrm{d}y) \\sigma(x)$ (up to a constant). This expression is a function of $x$ and is not constant in general. The purpose of the scale function is to eliminate the drift term, not to make the diffusion coefficient constant. The Lamperti transform, not the scale function transform, is used for the latter purpose.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, only option A is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2970994"}, {"introduction": "From concept to calculation, this practice asks you to construct and apply a scale function to a specific, important SDE: the geometric Brownian motion.

The given Itô's formula is\n$$df(Y_{t}) = f'(Y_{t})\\,dY_{t} + \\tfrac{1}{2} f''(Y_{t})\\,\\varsigma(Y_{t})^{2} \\, dt$$\nfor a process $Y_t$ with SDE $dY_t = \\beta(Y_t) dt + \\varsigma(Y_t) dW_t$.\nFor our case, $f=s$, $Y_t = X_t$, the drift coefficient is $\\beta(x) = \\mu x$, and the diffusion coefficient is $\\varsigma(x) = \\sigma x$.\nApplying the formula, we have:\n$$dZ_t = ds(X_t) = s'(X_t) dX_t + \\frac{1}{2} s''(X_t) (\\sigma X_t)^2 dt$$\nSubstituting the expression for $dX_t$:\n$$dZ_t = s'(X_t) (\\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 X_t^2 s''(X_t) dt$$\nGrouping the $dt$ and $dW_t$ terms, we obtain the SDE for $Z_t$:\n$$dZ_t = \\left( \\mu X_t s'(X_t) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 X_t^2 s''(X_t) \\right) dt + \\left( \\sigma X_t s'(X_t) \\right) dW_t$$\nThe drift coefficient of $Z_t$ is $\\mu X_t s'(X_t) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 X_t^2 s''(X_t)$, and the diffusion coefficient is $\\sigma X_t s'(X_t)$. Note that the drift term, as a function of $x=X_t$, is precisely the action of the infinitesimal generator $L$ on the function $s$, i.e., $(Ls)(X_t)$.\n\n**2. ODE for Zero Drift**\n\nThe process $Z_t$ has zero drift if its drift coefficient is identically zero. This condition translates to the following ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the function $s(x)$:\n$$\\mu x s'(x) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 x^2 s''(x) = 0, \\quad \\text{for } x > 0$$\nThis is the condition that $s$ is a scale function for the diffusion $X$, commonly written as $Ls = 0$.\n\n**3. Solution of the ODE and the Diffusion Coefficient of $Z$**\n\nWe solve the ODE derived in the previous step. Let $v(x) = s'(x)$. The ODE becomes a first-order linear ODE for $v(x)$:\n$$\\mu x v(x) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 x^2 v'(x) = 0$$\nSince $x > 0$, we can divide by $x$. For $v(x) \\neq 0$, we can rearrange it into a separable form:\n$$\\frac{v'(x)}{v(x)} = -\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2 x}$$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $x$:\n$$\\int \\frac{v'(x)}{v(x)} dx = \\int -\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2 x} dx$$\n$$\\ln|v(x)| = -\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} \\ln|x| + C_0$$\nSince $x > 0$ and $s$ is strictly increasing, we have $v(x) = s'(x) > 0$. Thus, $|x|=x$ and $|v(x)|=v(x)$.\n$$\\ln(v(x)) = \\ln\\left(x^{-2\\mu/\\sigma^2}\\right) + C_0$$\nExponentiating both sides gives:\n$$v(x) = \\exp(C_0) x^{-2\\mu/\\sigma^2} = C_1 x^{-2\\mu/\\sigma^2}$$\nwhere $C_1 = \\exp(C_0)$ is an arbitrary positive constant.\nSo, $s'(x) = C_1 x^{-2\\mu/\\sigma^2}$. To find $s(x)$, we integrate $s'(x)$. This yields $s(x) = C_1 \\int x^{-2\\mu/\\sigma^2} dx + C_2$. The explicit form of $s(x)$ depends on whether the exponent is $-1$, but we only need $s'(x)$ for the next step.\n\nThe diffusion coefficient of $Z_t$, as a function of the state $x=X_t$, is $\\sigma x s'(x)$. Substituting the expression for $s'(x)$:\n$$\\text{Diffusion coeff. of } Z = \\sigma x \\left(C_1 x^{-2\\mu/\\sigma^2}\\right) = C_1 \\sigma x^{1 - 2\\mu/\\sigma^2}$$\n\n**4. Constant Diffusion and Normalization**\n\nFor the diffusion coefficient of $Z$ to be tractable in the sense of being constant (independent of $x$), the exponent of $x$ in the expression $C_1 \\sigma x^{1 - 2\\mu/\\sigma^2}$ must be zero.\n$$1 - \\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} = 0 \\implies 2\\mu = \\sigma^2 \\implies \\mu = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}$$\nThis is the condition on the drift parameter $\\mu$. Under this condition, the diffusion coefficient becomes a constant:\n$$\\text{Diffusion coeff. of } Z = C_1 \\sigma x^{0} = C_1 \\sigma$$\nThe problem asks to choose the normalization of $s$ so that this constant equals $1$. The normalization of $s$ is controlled by the constant $C_1$. We set:\n$$C_1 \\sigma = 1 \\implies C_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sigma}$$\nWith this choice of $C_1$, the diffusion coefficient is exactly $1$.\n\n**Justification for Order Preservation**\n\nThe pathwise comparison principle for one-dimensional SDEs states that if we have two solutions $Y_t^{(1)}$ and $Y_t^{(2)}$ to the same SDE $dY_t = \\beta(Y_t) dt + \\varsigma(Y_t) dW_t$ with initial conditions $Y_0^{(1)} \\le Y_0^{(2)}$, then $Y_t^{(1)} \\le Y_t^{(2)}$ for all $t \\ge 0$ almost surely, provided the coefficients $\\beta$ and $\\varsigma$ are regular enough (e.g., locally Lipschitz) to ensure pathwise uniqueness of solutions.\n\nLet $s$ be the scale function satisfying $Ls=0$. The transformed process $Z_t = s(X_t)$ satisfies the driftless SDE $dZ_t = \\sigma_Z(Z_t)dW_t$, where the diffusion coefficient is $\\sigma_Z(z) = \\sigma g(z) s'(g(z))$ with $g = s^{-1}$. This diffusion coefficient is continuously differentiable because $s$ is $C^2$ and strictly increasing, thus ensuring the local Lipschitz condition is met.\n\nConsider two solutions of the original SDE, $X_t^{x_0}$ and $X_t^{y_0}$, with initial conditions $x_0 \\le y_0$. Let the corresponding transformed processes be $Z_t^{(1)} = s(X_t^{x_0})$ and $Z_t^{(2)} = s(X_t^{y_0})$. Both $Z_t^{(1)}$ and $Z_t^{(2)}$ satisfy the same driftless SDE. Their initial conditions are $Z_0^{(1)} = s(x_0)$ and $Z_0^{(2)} = s(y_0)$. Since $s$ is strictly increasing, the condition $x_0 \\le y_0$ implies $s(x_0) \\le s(y_0)$, so $Z_0^{(1)} \\le Z_0^{(2)}$.\n\nBy the pathwise comparison principle applied to the SDE for $Z$, the ordering of the initial conditions is preserved for all time. Therefore, $Z_t^{(1)} \\le Z_t^{(2)}$ for all $t \\ge 0$ almost surely. This is equivalent to $s(X^{x_0}_{t}) \\le s(X^{y_{0}}_{t})$ almost surely for all $t \\ge 0$. Thus, the transformation by a strictly increasing function $s$ preserves the order of solutions. In the specific case found in part 4, the SDE for $Z_t$ is simply $dZ_t = dW_t$, for which the comparison principle trivially holds.\n\nThe final answer requested is the value of the normalized diffusion coefficient in the constant-diffusion case. As derived in step 4, this value is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2970999"}]}
