The overall problem is well-posed and objective, with no missing information, contradictions, or subjective elements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n***\n\nThe given stochastic differential equation is $dX_{t}=dW_{t}$. This is a one-dimensional Itô diffusion of the general form $dX_{t} = b(X_t)dt + \\sigma(X_t)dW_{t}$, where the drift coefficient is $b(x) = 0$ and the diffusion coefficient is $\\sigma(x) = 1$.\n\nThe infinitesimal generator $\\mathcal{L}$ of this diffusion process is defined via Itô's formula. For a twice continuously differentiable function $f(x)$, the generator is given by:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}f(x) = b(x)\\frac{df}{dx} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma(x)^2\\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}\n$$\nSubstituting $b(x)=0$ and $\\sigma(x)=1$, the generator for this specific process is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}\n$$\n\n**1. Determination of the Scale Function $s(x)$**\n\nThe scale function $s(x)$ for a one-dimensional diffusion is a non-constant function that satisfies the equation $\\mathcal{L}s(x) = 0$. For this diffusion, the condition is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d^2s}{dx^2} = 0\n$$\nwhich simplifies to $s''(x) = 0$.\nIntegrating this ordinary differential equation once with respect to $x$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{ds}{dx} = C_1\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration. Integrating a second time gives the general form of the scale function:\n$$\ns(x) = C_1 x + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_2$ is another constant of integration.\n\nThe problem provides two normalization conditions to uniquely determine $s(x)$.\nFirst, $s(0) = 0$. Applying this to the general solution:\n$$\ns(0) = C_1(0) + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = 0\n$$\nSecond, $s'(0) = 1$. The derivative of $s(x)$ is $s'(x) = C_1$. Applying the condition:\n$$\ns'(0) = C_1 = 1\n$$\nThus, the constants are $C_1 = 1$ and $C_2 = 0$. The unique, strictly increasing scale function satisfying the given normalization is:\n$$\ns(x) = x\n$$\nThis function is strictly increasing since its derivative, $s'(x) = 1$, is positive.\n\n**2. Determination of the Speed Density $m'(x)$**\n\nThe generator $\\mathcal{L}$ can be expressed in terms of the scale function $s(x)$ and the speed measure, which has a density $m'(x)$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure. This form, consistent with the Itô generator, is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}f(x) = \\frac{1}{m'(x)}\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{1}{s'(x)}\\frac{df}{dx}\\right)\n$$\nWait, this is not the standard form. Let's start from the known relation between the coefficients $(b,\\sigma)$ and the densities $(s,m)$. The standard relation linking the Itô generator $\\mathcal{L} = b(x)\\partial_x + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2(x)\\partial_x^2$ to the Feller-McKean generator $G = \\frac{d}{dm}\\frac{d}{ds}$ is that they are identical, i.e., $\\mathcal{L}=G$. Note that $\\frac{d}{dm} = \\frac{1}{m'(x)} \\frac{d}{dx}$.\n\nLet's expand the Feller-McKean generator:\n$$\nG f(x) = \\frac{1}{m'(x)} \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{f'(x)}{s'(x)} \\right) = \\frac{1}{m'(x)} \\left[ \\frac{f''(x)}{s'(x)} - \\frac{f'(x)s''(x)}{(s'(x))^2} \\right]\n$$\nWe equate this to $\\mathcal{L}f(x) = b(x)f'(x) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma(x)^2f''(x)$.\nComparing the coefficients of $f''(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{m'(x)s'(x)} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma(x)^2 \\implies m'(x) = \\frac{2}{\\sigma(x)^2 s'(x)}\n$$\nComparing the coefficients of $f'(x)$:\n$$\n-\\frac{s''(x)}{m'(x)(s'(x))^2} = b(x) \\implies s''(x) = -b(x) m'(x) (s'(x))^2\n$$\nThis also yields the known ODE for $s'(x)$, since substituting the expression for $m'(x)$ gives $s''(x) = -b(x) \\left( \\frac{2}{\\sigma(x)^2 s'(x)} \\right) (s'(x))^2 = -\\frac{2b(x)}{\\sigma(x)^2}s'(x)$, which upon integration gives the scale function.\n\nUsing the derived formula for the speed density, $m'(x) = \\frac{2}{\\sigma(x)^2 s'(x)}$, with our known values $\\sigma(x)=1$ and $s'(x)=1$:\n$$\nm'(x) = \\frac{2}{1^2 \\cdot 1} = 2\n$$\nSo, the speed density is constant, $m'(x) = 2$.\n\n**3. Recurrence vs. Transience**\n\nA one-dimensional diffusion on an interval $(l, r)$ is classified as recurrent or transient based on the behavior of its scale function at the boundaries. The process is **recurrent** if and only if it can neither reach $l$ nor $r$ in a finite expected time. This corresponds to the scale function tending to $-\\infty$ at the left boundary and $+\\infty$ at the right boundary.\nMathematically, the diffusion is recurrent if and only if:\n$$\ns(l) = \\lim_{x \\to l^+} s(x) = -\\infty \\quad \\text{and} \\quad s(r) = \\lim_{x \\to r^-} s(x) = +\\infty\n$$\nIf either limit is finite, the process is transient, as it can escape through that boundary.\n\nFor this problem, the diffusion is on the entire real line, so the interval is $(l, r) = (-\\infty, \\infty)$. We have found the scale function to be $s(x) = x$. We now evaluate the limits at the boundaries:\n-   At the right boundary, $r = +\\infty$:\n$$\n\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} s(x) = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} x = +\\infty\n$$\n-   At the left boundary, $l = -\\infty$:\n$$\n\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} s(x) = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} x = -\\infty\n$$\nSince both conditions ($s(-\\infty) = -\\infty$ and $s(+\\infty) = +\\infty$) are satisfied, the diffusion is **recurrent**. This is the well-known property of standard one-dimensional Brownian motion.\n\nThe problem asks for the row matrix $(s(x), m'(x))$.

The Dambis–Dubins–Schwarz theorem provides this relationship through the quadratic variation of $Y_t$.\n\nThe SDE for $Y_t$ is $dY_t = g(Y_t)dW_t$. Its quadratic variation is $d\\langle Y \\rangle_t = g^2(Y_t)dt$. The DDS theorem establishes that $Y_t$ can be represented as a standard Brownian motion $B$ evaluated at a new time $u = A_t = \\langle Y \\rangle_t$. The differential form of this time change is:\n$$ du = g^2(Y_t)\\,dt $$\nThis equation is central. It tells us that an increment $du$ of the Brownian clock corresponds to an increment $dt = du/g^2(Y_t)$ of physical time.\n\nThe occupation measure of the process $X_t$ describes the amount of physical time it spends in different regions of its state space. For a recurrent diffusion, the density of this measure is proportional to the density of the speed measure, $m'(x)$. The density of the speed measure is known from the factorization $L = \\frac{d}{dm}\\frac{d}{ds}$ to be $m'(x) = \\frac{2}{s'(x)\\sigma^2(x)}$.\n\nA numerical scheme should reproduce this occupation density. The most natural way to construct such a scheme based on the DDS theorem is to discretize the process in the Brownian clock $u$, where it behaves as a simple standard Brownian motion.\n\nLet's choose a constant step size $h > 0$ for the Brownian clock, so $\\Delta u_n = h$.\n1.  **Update in the Scale Coordinate $Y$**: Since $Y$ is a standard Brownian motion in the $u$-clock, a step of size $h$ in $u$ corresponds to a random increment with mean $0$ and variance $h$. The update rule is:\n    $$ Y_{n+1} = Y_n + \\xi_n \\sqrt{h}, \\quad \\text{where } \\xi_n \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1) \\text{ are i.i.d.} $$\n2.  **Update the Physical Time $t$**: The corresponding increment in physical time, $\\Delta t_n = t_{n+1}-t_n$, is found by discretizing the relation $dt = du/g^2(Y_t)$. Using an explicit approximation:\n    $$ \\Delta t_n \\approx \\frac{\\Delta u_n}{g^2(Y_n)} = \\frac{h}{g^2(Y_n)} $$\n    where $Y_n$ is the state at the beginning of the step.\n3.  **Map Back to Original Coordinate $X$**: The state in the original coordinate is recovered via the inverse scale function: $X_{n+1} = s^{-1}(Y_{n+1})$.\n\nLet us verify that this scheme produces the correct occupation measure. The process takes steps of constant \"Brownian-time\" duration $h$. The corresponding physical time duration of each step is $\\Delta t_n = h/g^2(Y_n)$. The number of steps the process takes in a small interval $[y, y+dy]$ is, in the long run, uniform across the state space of $Y$. Therefore, the total physical time spent in that interval is proportional to the duration of each step taken from there, i.e., proportional to $1/g^2(y)$. So, the occupation density in the $y$-coordinate, $\\rho_Y(y)$, satisfies $\\rho_Y(y) \\propto 1/g^2(y)$.\n\nTo find the occupation density $\\rho_X(x)$ in the original coordinate, we perform a change of variables: $\\rho_X(x)dx = \\rho_Y(y)dy$. With $y=s(x)$ and $dy=s'(x)dx$, we get $\\rho_X(x) = \\rho_Y(s(x))s'(x)$. Substituting our finding for $\\rho_Y(y)$:\n$$ \\rho_X(x) \\propto \\frac{1}{g^2(s(x))} s'(x) $$\nNow, we use the definition $g(y) = s'(s^{-1}(y))\\sigma(s^{-1}(y))$, which implies $g(s(x)) = s'(x)\\sigma(x)$.\n$$ \\rho_X(x) \\propto \\frac{s'(x)}{\\left(s'(x)\\sigma(x)\\right)^2} = \\frac{s'(x)}{(s'(x))^2 \\sigma^2(x)} = \\frac{1}{s'(x)\\sigma^2(x)} $$\nThis resulting occupation density is proportional to the speed measure density $m'(x) = \\frac{2}{s'(x)\\sigma^2(x)}$. The scheme is therefore correct.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options based on this derivation.\n\n**A.** This option proposes the scheme: $Y_{n+1} = Y_n + \\xi_n\\sqrt{h}$ and $t_{n+1} = t_n + h/g^2(Y_n)$. This precisely matches the scheme derived above. The justification provided in the option—that it keeps the Brownian clock increment constant and yields the correct occupation density—is also correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.** This option proposes a standard Euler–Maruyama scheme for the SDE $dY_t = g(Y_t)dW_t$ with a fixed physical time step $h$: $Y_{n+1} = Y_n + g(Y_n)\\,\\xi_n\\sqrt{h}$ and $t_{n+1} = t_n + h$. While this scheme does converge to the process $Y_t$ and its stationary (occupation) distribution is indeed proportional to $1/g^2(y)$, leading to the correct occupation measure for $X$, it does not \"implement the correct time rescaling\" as required by the problem's framing. It uses a fixed physical time step. The problem explicitly asks for a scheme designed around the time-change principle. The option's rationale, \"no time rescaling is needed,\" is conceptually contrary to the DDS-based approach outlined in the problem statement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** This option proposes using constant variance increments for $Y$ and constant physical time steps: $Y_{n+1} = Y_n + \\xi_n\\sqrt{h}$ and $t_{n+1} = t_n + h$. In this case, the occupation density $\\rho_Y(y)$ would be uniform. Transforming back to the $X$ coordinate gives $\\rho_X(x) \\propto s'(x)$. This is not proportional to the speed measure density $m'(x) \\propto 1/(s'(x)\\sigma^2(x))$ in the general case.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.** This option proposes an incorrect time rescaling factor. It suggests $\\Delta t_n = h/\\sigma^2(s^{-1}(Y_n))$. The correct factor is $1/g^2(Y_n) = 1/[(s'(s^{-1}(Y_n)))^2 \\sigma^2(s^{-1}(Y_n))]$. The scheme omits the $(s')^2$ term. The occupation density produced by this scheme would be $\\rho_X(x) \\propto s'(x)/\\sigma^2(x)$, which is not the correct speed measure density. The justification that the $s'$ factor is unnecessary is false; this factor is a crucial part of the volatility term $g(y)$ that governs the time change.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2989182"}]}
