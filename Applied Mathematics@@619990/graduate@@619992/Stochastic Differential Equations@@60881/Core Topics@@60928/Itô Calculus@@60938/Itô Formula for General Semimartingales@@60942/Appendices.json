It is a well-posed question within the established mathematical framework of stochastic calculus, with all necessary components clearly defined and consistent. We can proceed with the solution.\n\nLet the semimartingale be $X_{t} = B_{t} + Y_{t}$, where $B_{t}$ is a standard Brownian motion and $Y_{t}$ is a compound Poisson process defined as $Y_{t}=\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{t}}J_{i}$. We are asked to compute the quadratic variation $[X]_{t}$ using its definition as a limit in probability of discrete sums.\n\nLet $\\Pi = \\{0=t_{0}<t_{1}<\\cdots<t_{m}=t\\}$ be a deterministic partition of the interval $[0, t]$. The mesh of the partition is given by $||\\Pi|| = \\max_{k}(t_{k+1}-t_{k})$.

This corresponds to the general property of quadratic variation for semimartingales:\n$$\n[X]_{t} = [B+Y]_{t} = [B]_{t} + [Y]_{t} + 2[B,Y]_{t}.\n$$\nWe now compute each of these three terms.\n\n1.  **Quadratic Variation of Brownian Motion, $[B]_{t}$**:\n    The first term is the quadratic variation of the standard Brownian motion $B_t$. It is a fundamental result in stochastic calculus that\n    $$\n    [B]_{t} = \\lim_{||\\Pi||\\to 0} \\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} (B_{t_{k+1}}-B_{t_{k}})^{2} = t.\n    $$\n    This convergence holds in the $L^{2}$ sense, which implies convergence in probability. This term represents the continuous part of the quadratic variation of $X_{t}$.\n\n2.  **Quadratic Variation of the Compound Poisson Process, $[Y]_{t}$**:\n    The second term is the quadratic variation of the compound Poisson process $Y_{t}$. The process $Y_{t}$ is a pure-jump process. Its sample paths are constant except for a finite number of jumps in any finite time interval $[0, t]$. Let the jump times of the underlying Poisson process $N_{t}$ be $T_{1}, T_{2}, \\dots$. At time $T_{i}$, the process $Y_{t}$ jumps by an amount $\\Delta Y_{T_{i}} = Y_{T_{i}} - Y_{T_{i}-} = J_{i}$. Between jumps, $Y_{t}$ is constant.\n    Consider the sum $\\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} (Y_{t_{k+1}}-Y_{t_{k}})^{2}$. For any partition interval $[t_{k}, t_{k+1}]$ that does not contain a jump time $T_{i}$, the increment $Y_{t_{k+1}}-Y_{t_{k}}$ is $0$.\n    With probability $1$, for a sufficiently fine partition (i.e., $||\\Pi||$ small enough), each jump time $T_{i}$ in the interval $(0, t]$ will be contained in a unique partition interval, say $T_i \\in (t_{k_i}, t_{k_i+1}]$. For such an interval, the increment is $Y_{t_{k_i+1}}-Y_{t_{k_i}} = J_{i}$.\n    Therefore, for a fine partition, the sum of squared increments becomes\n    $$\n    \\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} (Y_{t_{k+1}}-Y_{t_{k}})^{2} \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{t}} J_{i}^{2}.\n    $$\n    This approximation becomes an equality in the limit as $||\\Pi||\\to 0$. Since for a fixed sample path $\\omega$, the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{t}(\\omega)} J_{i}(\\omega)^{2}$ is a fixed number, the limit converges almost surely to this sum.\n    $$\n    [Y]_{t} = \\lim_{||\\Pi||\\to 0} \\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} (Y_{t_{k+1}}-Y_{t_{k}})^{2} = \\sum_{0<s\\leq t} (\\Delta Y_{s})^{2} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{t}} J_{i}^{2}.\n    $$\n\n3.  **Quadratic Covariation of $B_{t}$ and $Y_{t}$, $[B, Y]_{t}$**:\n    The third term is the quadratic covariation of $B_{t}$ and $Y_{t}$.\n    $$\n    [B, Y]_{t} = \\lim_{||\\Pi||\\to 0} \\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} (B_{t_{k+1}}-B_{t_{k}})(Y_{t_{k+1}}-Y_{t_{k}}).\n    $$\n    As argued above, the increments $Y_{t_{k+1}}-Y_{t_{k}}$ are non-zero only for intervals containing the jump times $T_{i}$. Thus, the sum reduces to\n    $$\n    \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{t}} (B_{t_{k_i+1}}-B_{t_{k_i}})J_{i}.\n    $$\n    where $T_i \\in (t_{k_i}, t_{k_i+1}]$. As the mesh $||\\Pi||\\to 0$, we have $t_{k_i+1}-t_{k_i} \\to 0$. Since the sample paths of Brownian motion are almost surely continuous, $B_{t_{k_i+1}}-B_{t_{k_i}} \\to B_{T_i} - B_{T_i} = 0$.\n    Since $N_{t}$ is finite almost surely, the sum is a finite sum of terms, each of which tends to $0$. Therefore, the entire sum converges to $0$ almost surely.\n    $$\n    [B,Y]_{t} = 0.\n    $$\n    This is a general result: the quadratic covariation of a continuous martingale (like $B_{t}$) and a pure-jump process of finite variation (like $Y_{t}$) is zero, especially when they are independent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCombining the results for the three terms, we obtain the quadratic variation of $X_{t}$:\n$$\n[X]_{t} = [B]_{t} + [Y]_{t} + 2[B,Y]_{t} = t + \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{t}} J_{i}^{2} + 2(0).\n$$\nThe final expression for the quadratic variation of $X_t$ is\n$$\n[X]_{t} = t + \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{t}} J_{i}^{2}.\n$$\nThis expression clearly separates the contribution from the continuous part of the process, $t$, which is $[B]_{t}$, and the contribution from the jump part, $\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{t}} J_{i}^{2}$, which is the sum of the squares of the jumps of $X_t$ up to time $t$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{t + \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{t}} J_{i}^{2}}\n$$", "id": "2981325"}, {"introduction": "With a firm grasp of quadratic variation, we can now derive the Itô formula for the simplest non-trivial case, $f(x) = x^2$.

The solution will be derived from the foundational definitions of the stochastic integral and quadratic variation for semimartingales. This approach is equivalent to re-deriving Itô's formula for the function $f(x)=x^2$.\n\nLet us consider a sequence of partitions of the interval $[0, t]$, denoted by $\\pi_n = \\{0 = t_0^{(n)}, t_1^{(n)}, \\dots, t_{k_n}^{(n)} = t\\}$, such that the mesh of the partition, $\\|\\pi_n\\| = \\max_{i} (t_{i+1}^{(n)} - t_i^{(n)})$, approaches $0$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\nWe begin with the elementary algebraic identity for the difference of squares, $b^2 - a^2 = (b-a)(b+a)$. We can rewrite this as $b^2 - a^2 = 2a(b-a) + (b-a)^2$. This identity is central to the derivation of Itô's formula.\n\nThe term $X_t^2 - X_0^2$ can be expressed as a telescoping sum over any such partition:\n$$\nX_t^2 - X_0^2 = \\sum_{i=0}^{k_n-1} \\left(X_{t_{i+1}^{(n)}}^2 - X_{t_i^{(n)}}^2\\right)\n$$\nThis is an exact identity for any finite partition. Applying the algebraic identity $b^2 - a^2 = 2a(b-a) + (b-a)^2$ to each term in the sum, with $b=X_{t_{i+1}^{(n)}}$ and $a=X_{t_i^{(n)}}$, we get:\n$$\nX_t^2 - X_0^2 = \\sum_{i=0}^{k_n-1} \\left[ 2X_{t_i^{(n)}}(X_{t_{i+1}^{(n)}} - X_{t_i^{(n)}}) + (X_{t_{i+1}^{(n)}} - X_{t_i^{(n)}})^2 \\right]\n$$\nThis can be split into two separate sums:\n$$\nX_t^2 - X_0^2 = 2 \\sum_{i=0}^{k_n-1} X_{t_i^{(n)}}(X_{t_{i+1}^{(n)}} - X_{t_i^{(n)}}) + \\sum_{i=0}^{k_n-1} (X_{t_{i+1}^{(n)}} - X_{t_i^{(n)}})^2\n$$\nThis equation holds pathwise for any given sample path $\\omega \\in \\Omega$ and any partition $\\pi_n$. We now analyze the limit of each sum as the mesh $\\|\\pi_n\\| \\to 0$.\n\nThe first sum, $\\sum_{i=0}^{k_n-1} X_{t_i^{(n)}}(X_{t_{i+1}^{(n)}} - X_{t_i^{(n)}})$, is the discrete approximation of the stochastic integral of the process $X_{s-}$ with respect to $X_s$. The process $(X_{s-})_{s \\ge 0}$ is left-continuous and adapted, hence it is a predictable process. For a semimartingale $X$, the stochastic integral $\\int_0^t X_{s-} dX_s$ is defined as the limit in probability of these Riemann-type sums. Therefore, as $\\|\\pi_n\\| \\to 0$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{k_n-1} X_{t_i^{(n)}}(X_{t_{i+1}^{(n)}} - X_{t_i^{(n)}}) \\xrightarrow{p} \\int_0^t X_{s-} dX_s\n$$\nThe existence and properties of this limit are guaranteed because $X$ is a semimartingale. The canonical decomposition $X_t = X_0 + M_t + A_t$ into a local martingale $M$ and a predictable finite-variation process $A$ is the fundamental reason why such an integration theory can be constructed.\n\nThe second sum, $\\sum_{i=0}^{k_n-1} (X_{t_{i+1}^{(n)}} - X_{t_i^{(n)}})^2$, is the sum of squared increments of $X$ over the partition. By definition, the quadratic variation of a semimartingale $X$, denoted $[X]_t$, is the limit in probability of these sums as the mesh of the partition tends to zero.\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{k_n-1} (X_{t_{i+1}^{(n)}} - X_{t_i^{(n)}})^2 \\xrightarrow{p} [X]_t\n$$\nThis definition inherently accounts for both the continuous and jump parts of the semimartingale. The quadratic variation is given by $[X]_t = [X^c]_t + \\sum_{0 < s \\le t} (\\Delta X_s)^2$, where $X^c$ is the continuous martingale part of $X$ and $\\Delta X_s = X_s - X_{s-}$ are the jumps of $X$. The discrete sum correctly converges to this total quadratic variation.\n\nTaking the limit in probability of the entire identity for $X_t^2 - X_0^2$, we obtain:\n$$\nX_t^2 - X_0^2 = 2 \\int_0^t X_{s-} dX_s + [X]_t\n$$\nThis identity is a specific instance of Itô's formula, applied to the function $f(x)=x^2$. Our derivation from first principles confirms its validity for any càdlàg semimartingale $X$.\n\nNow, we can substitute this established identity into the given expression for $E_t$:\n$$\nE_t = \\left( X_t^2 - X_0^2 \\right) - 2\\int_0^t X_{s-} dX_s - [X]_t\n$$\nSubstituting the expression we derived for $X_t^2 - X_0^2$:\n$$\nE_t = \\left( 2\\int_0^t X_{s-} dX_s + [X]_t \\right) - 2\\int_0^t X_{s-} dX_s - [X]_t\n$$\nThe terms cancel out completely:\n$$\nE_t = 0\n$$\nThus, the expression $E_t$ simplifies to the constant value $0$.

This is the \"jump compensation term arising from convexity\".\nThe martingale component is the compensated process:\n$$ M_t^{\\text{jump}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_t} \\left[ (X_{T_i-}+Y_i-a)^+ - (X_{T_i-}-a)^+ \\right] - \\int_0^t \\lambda \\mathbb{E}_{Y}\\left[ (X_{s-}+Y-a)^+ - (X_{s-}-a)^+ \\right] ds $$\n\nAdding these components gives the full expression for $(X_t-a)^+$.\nTo present the final decomposition with all required parts explicitly identified, we write $(X_t-a)^+$ as the sum of its initial value, drift, continuous martingale part, local time, and the raw jump sum, which implicitly contains the compensator and jump martingale.\n\nThe final expression is the sum of these identified components:\n1.  **Initial value**: $(x_0-a)^+$.\n2.  **Drift**: $\\int_0^t \\mu \\mathbf{1}_{\\{X_{s-}>a\\}} ds$.\n3.  **Continuous martingale**: $\\int_0^t \\sigma \\mathbf{1}_{\\{X_{s-}>a\\}} dW_s$.\n4.  **Local time**: $\\frac{1}{2}\\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0^+} \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\epsilon} \\int_0^t \\mathbf{1}_{\\{a-\\epsilon < \\sigma W_s < a+\\epsilon\\}} ds$.\n5.  **Total Jump Part**: $\\sum_{i=1}^{N_t} \\left[ (X_{T_i-}+Y_i-a)^+ - (X_{T_i-}-a)^+ \\right]$.\n\nAdding these components gives the full expression for $(X_t-a)^+$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\n(x_{0}-a)^{+} + \\int_{0}^{t} \\mu \\mathbf{1}_{\\{X_{s-}>a\\}} ds + \\int_{0}^{t} \\sigma \\mathbf{1}_{\\{X_{s-}>a\\}} dW_{s} + \\frac{1}{2}\\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0^+} \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\epsilon} \\int_0^t \\mathbf{1}_{\\{a-\\epsilon < \\sigma W_s < a+\\epsilon\\}} ds + \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{t}} \\left[ (X_{T_{i}-}+Y_{i}-a)^{+} - (X_{T_{i}-}-a)^{+} \\right]\n}$$", "id": "2981331"}]}
