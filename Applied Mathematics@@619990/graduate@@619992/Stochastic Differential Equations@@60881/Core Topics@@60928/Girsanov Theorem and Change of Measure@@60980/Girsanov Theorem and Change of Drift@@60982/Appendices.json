It is a well-posed problem in the theory of stochastic calculus, specifically concerning the application of Girsanov's theorem for a change of measure. All terms are standard and the data provided is self-contained and consistent.\n\nThe objective is to find the Radon-Nikodym derivative $Z_T$ that transforms the process $X_t$, which follows the stochastic differential equation (SDE) $dX_t=\\mu\\,dt+\\sigma\\,dW_t$, into a martingale under a new measure $\\mathbb{Q}$. We will also verify the properties of $X_t$ under this new measure.\n\nFirst, we identify the structure of the SDE for $X_t$. It is given by\n$$\ndX_t = \\mu \\, dt + \\sigma \\, dW_t\n$$\nwhere $W_t$ is a standard Brownian motion under the probability measure $\\mathbb{P}$. For $X_t$ to be a martingale under a new measure $\\mathbb{Q}$, its SDE under $\\mathbb{Q}$ must not contain a drift term. That is, its dynamics must be of the form\n$$\ndX_t = \\sigma \\, d\\widetilde{W}_t\n$$\nwhere $\\widetilde{W}_t$ is a standard Brownian motion under the measure $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nAccording to Girsanov's theorem, we can change the drift from $\\mu$ to $0$ by choosing a Girsanov kernel $\\theta_s$ such that the new drift $\\mu - \\sigma \\theta_s = 0$. This implies we must choose the constant process $\\theta_s = \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma}$.\n\nWith this choice, the theorem states that the process $\\widetilde{W}_t$ defined by\n$$\n\\widetilde{W}_t = W_t + \\int_0^t \\theta_s \\, ds = W_t + \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma}t\n$$\nis a standard Brownian motion under the measure $\\mathbb{Q}$, whose Radon-Nikodym derivative process is given by the stochastic exponential $Z_t = \\mathcal{E}(M)_t$, where\n$$\nM_t = -\\int_0^t \\theta_s \\, dW_s = -\\int_0^t \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma} \\, dW_s = -\\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma} W_t\n$$\nThe stochastic exponential $\\mathcal{E}(M)_t$ is defined as:\n$$\nZ_t = \\mathcal{E}(M)_t = \\exp\\left(M_t - \\frac{1}{2}[M]_t\\right)\n$$\nwhere $[M]_t$ is the quadratic variation of the process $M_t$.

A sufficient condition for this is Novikov's condition, which states that if $\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P}}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^T \\theta_s^2 \\, ds\\right)\\right]  \\infty$, then $Z_t$ is a martingale.

Thus, $Z_t$ is a true martingale, and $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a valid probability measure equivalent to $\\mathbb{P}$.\n\nThe explicit expression for $Z_T$ is obtained by setting $t=T$:\n$$\nZ_T = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma} W_T - \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\mu^2}{\\sigma^2} T\\right)\n$$\n\nNext, we verify that under the measure $\\mathbb{Q}$, the process $X_t$ is a martingale with quadratic variation $[X]_t = \\sigma^2 t$.\nBy construction, under $\\mathbb{Q}$, the process $\\widetilde{W}_t=W_t + \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma}t$ is a standard Brownian motion. We can express the original Brownian motion differential as $dW_t = d\\widetilde{W}_t - \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma}dt$. Substituting this into the SDE for $X_t$:\n$$\ndX_t = \\mu \\, dt + \\sigma \\left(d\\widetilde{W}_t - \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma}dt\\right) = \\mu \\, dt + \\sigma \\, d\\widetilde{W}_t - \\mu \\, dt = \\sigma \\, d\\widetilde{W}_t\n$$\nThis is the SDE for $X_t$ under the measure $\\mathbb{Q}$. Since the drift term is zero and $\\sigma$ is a constant, $X_t$ is a continuous local martingale under $\\mathbb{Q}$. To show it is a true martingale, we can check that $\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}[|X_t|]  \\infty$. The solution to the SDE under $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $X_t = X_0 + \\sigma \\widetilde{W}_t = x_0 + \\sigma \\widetilde{W}_t$. Since $\\widetilde{W}_t$ is a $\\mathbb{Q}$-Brownian motion, its first moment is finite, so $\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}[|X_t|] \\leq |x_0| + \\sigma \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}[|\\widetilde{W}_t|]  \\infty$. Therefore, $X_t$ is a true martingale under $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nFinally, we determine the quadratic variation of $X_t$. The quadratic variation is a property of the process path and does not depend on the probability measure. We can compute it from the SDE under either measure. Using the SDE under $\\mathbb{P}$, $dX_t = \\mu \\, dt + \\sigma \\, dW_t$:\n$$\n[X]_t = \\int_0^t \\sigma^2 \\, ds = \\sigma^2 t\n$$\nUsing the SDE under $\\mathbb{Q}$, $dX_t = \\sigma \\, d\\widetilde{W}_t$:\n$$\n[X]_t = \\int_0^t \\sigma^2 \\, ds = \\sigma^2 t\n$$\nBoth calculations yield the same result, confirming that $X_t$ has quadratic variation $[X]_t = \\sigma^2 t$.

Second, we compute the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence from $\\mathbb{Q}$ to $\\mathbb{P}$.\n\n**Part 1: Construction of the Radon-Nikodym Density**\n\nThe SDE for $X_t$ under the measure $\\mathbb{P}$ is $dX_t = b\\,dt + \\sigma\\,dW_t$. We want to find a new measure $\\mathbb{Q}$ such that under this measure, the process $X$ has the same law as process $Y$ under $\\mathbb{P}$.
