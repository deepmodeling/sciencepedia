First, a general explanation of why the Beneš conditions ensure that the stochastic exponential $Z_t$ is a true martingale. Second, a specific computation of $\\mathbb{E}[Z_T]$ for an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.\n\n**Part 1: The Beneš Conditions and the Martingale Property**\n\nLet $M_t = \\int_{0}^{t} \\theta_s\\,dW_s$. The process $Z_t$ is the Doléans-Dade exponential of the continuous local martingale $M_t$, given by $Z_t = \\mathcal{E}(M)_t$. It is defined as\n$$\nZ_t = \\exp\\!\\left( M_t - \\frac{1}{2} \\langle M \\rangle_t \\right) = \\exp\\!\\left( \\int_{0}^{t} \\theta_s\\,dW_s \\;-\\; \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{t} \\theta_s^{2}\\,ds \\right).\n$$\nThe conditions on $b$ and $\\sigma$ for the SDE $dX_t = b(X_t)dt + \\sigma dW_t$ ensure the existence of a unique strong solution $X_t$. The condition of linear growth on $\\phi$ implies that $\\theta_t = \\phi(X_t)$ is a well-defined process such that $\\int_0^T \\mathbb{E}[\\theta_s^2]\\,ds < \\infty$, which is sufficient for the stochastic integral $\\int_0^t \\theta_s dW_s$ to be a martingale.\n\nBy applying Itô's formula, we find that the SDE for $Z_t$ is $dZ_t = Z_t \\theta_t\\,dW_t$.\nSince the SDE for $Z_t$ has no drift ($dt$) term, $(Z_t)_{t \\in [0,T]}$ is a local martingale. It starts at $Z_0 = \\exp(0) = 1$. Since $Z_t$ is always non-negative, it is a supermartingale, which implies $\\mathbb{E}[Z_t] \\le \\mathbb{E}[Z_0] = 1$ for all $t \\in [0,T]$.\n\nFor $(Z_t)_{t \\in [0,T]}$ to be a true martingale, its expectation must be constant. That is, we must have $\\mathbb{E}[Z_t] = 1$ for all $t \\in [0,T]$. A widely used sufficient condition for this is Novikov's condition, which states that if\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{T} \\theta_s^2\\,ds \\right) \\right] < \\infty,\n$$\nthen $(Z_t)_{t \\in [0,T]}$ is a uniformly integrable martingale, and thus a true martingale.\n\nThe Beneš conditions are a set of assumptions on the coefficients of the SDE for $X_t$ and the function $\\phi$ that are sufficient to guarantee that Novikov's condition holds. The conditions given in the problem are:\n1.  $b$ has linear growth: there exists a constant $K_1$ such that $|b(x)| \\le K_1(1+|x|)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n2.  $\\phi$ has linear growth: there exists a constant $K_2$ such that $|\\phi(x)| \\le K_2(1+|x|)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n(The Lipschitz property of $b$ and constancy of $\\sigma$ are also part of the standard setup for the Beneš criterion).\n\nThe reasoning is as follows. The linear growth of $b$ and the constant diffusion $\\sigma$ (which trivially has linear growth) control the growth of the moments of $X_t$. It is a standard result for SDEs that these conditions imply that all moments of $X_t$ are bounded on a finite time horizon, i.e., for any $p \\ge 1$,\n$$\n\\sup_{t \\in [0,T]} \\mathbb{E}[|X_t|^p] < C_p\n$$\nfor some constant $C_p$ that depends on $p$, $T$, and the initial condition $x$.\n\nNow, we use the linear growth of $\\phi$ to bound the term in the exponent of Novikov's condition:\n$$\n\\theta_s^2 = (\\phi(X_s))^2 \\le (K_2(1+|X_s|))^2 \\le 2K_2^2(1+X_s^2).\n$$\nIntegrating over $[0,T]$ gives\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} \\theta_s^2\\,ds \\le 2K_2^2 \\int_{0}^{T} (1+X_s^2)\\,ds = 2K_2^2 T + 2K_2^2 \\int_{0}^{T} X_s^2\\,ds.\n$$\nTherefore, to satisfy Novikov's condition, it is sufficient to show that\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\exp\\left( K_2^2 T + K_2^2 \\int_{0}^{T} X_s^2\\,ds \\right) \\right] = \\exp(K_2^2 T) \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\exp\\left( K_2^2 \\int_{0}^{T} X_s^2\\,ds \\right) \\right] < \\infty.\n$$\nThis reduces the problem to proving that $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\exp\\left(C \\int_0^T X_s^2 ds \\right)\\right] < \\infty$ for some positive constant $C$. This is the core result of the Beneš criterion. It states that for a process $X_t$ governed by an SDE with coefficients having at most linear growth, the exponential moment of the integral of $X_s^2$ is finite on any finite time interval. The proof of this fact is non-trivial and often relies on the Feynman-Kac formula to relate this expectation to the solution of a certain partial differential equation.\n\nIn summary, the Beneš conditions (linear growth on $b$ and $\\phi$) ensure the moments of $X_t$ are well-controlled, which in turn guarantees that the integral $\\int_0^T \\theta_s^2 ds$ does not grow too fast, leading to the satisfaction of Novikov's condition. This validates that $Z_t$ is a true martingale.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Case**\n\nWe are asked to compute $\\mathbb{E}[Z_T]$ for the specific case where $X_t$ is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and $\\theta_t$ is linear in $X_t$.\nThe SDE for $X_t$ is $dX_t = -\\beta X_t\\,dt + \\sigma\\,dW_t$, with $\\beta>0$ and $\\sigma \\neq 0$.\nThe process $\\theta_t$ is given by $\\theta_t = \\lambda X_t$, with $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFirst, we verify that the Beneš conditions, as described in Part 1, are satisfied for this specific model.\n- The drift function is $b(x) = -\\beta x$. This function is globally Lipschitz, as $|b(x) - b(y)| = |-\\beta(x-y)| = \\beta|x-y|$. It also has linear growth, since $|b(x)| = \\beta |x| \\le \\beta(1+|x|)$.\n- The function defining $\\theta_t$ is $\\phi(x) = \\lambda x$. This function also has linear growth, as $|\\phi(x)| = |\\lambda||x| \\le |\\lambda|(1+|x|)$.\n\nSince all the Beneš conditions are met, we can invoke the result explained in Part 1: the process $(Z_t)_{t \\in [0,T]}$ is a true martingale under the measure $\\mathbb{P}$.\n\nThe definition of a martingale $(M_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ states that for any $s < t$, $\\mathbb{E}[M_t | \\mathcal{F}_s] = M_s$.\nBy taking the expectation on both sides, we get $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[M_t | \\mathcal{F}_s]] = \\mathbb{E}[M_s]$. By the law of total expectation, this simplifies to $\\mathbb{E}[M_t] = \\mathbb{E}[M_s]$. This means that a martingale has a constant expectation over time.\n\nApplying this property to our true martingale $(Z_t)_{t \\in [0,T]}$, we have\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Z_T] = \\mathbb{E}[Z_0].\n$$\nWe now compute the value of $Z_0$. From the definition of $Z_t$:\n$$\nZ_t = \\exp\\!\\left( \\int_{0}^{t} \\theta_s\\,dW_s \\;-\\; \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{t} \\theta_s^{2}\\,ds \\right).\n$$\nSetting $t=0$, the integrals are over the interval $[0,0]$, which evaluates to $0$:\n$$\nZ_0 = \\exp\\!\\left( \\int_{0}^{0} \\theta_s\\,dW_s \\;-\\; \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{0} \\theta_s^{2}\\,ds \\right) = \\exp(0 - 0) = \\exp(0) = 1.\n$$\nTherefore, the expectation of $Z_T$ is\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Z_T] = \\mathbb{E}[Z_0] = \\mathbb{E}[1] = 1.\n$$\nThe value is an explicit real number, as requested. The detailed setup of the OU process and the specific parameters are used to verify the Beneš conditions, which is the crucial step that permits the simple conclusion that $\\mathbb{E}[Z_T]=1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2992589"}, {"introduction": "While Girsanov's theorem provides a recipe for changing measures, it is not universally applicable.

A fundamental property of Brownian motion is its quadratic variation.\n\nLet $x \\in \\mathcal{C} = C([0,1],\\mathbb{R})$ be a continuous path. Its quadratic variation over $[0,1]$, denoted $[x,x]_1$, is defined as the limit of sums of squared increments over partitions of the interval, provided the limit exists. For a standard Brownian motion path $W = (W_t)_{t\\in[0,1]}$, it is a well-known theorem that its quadratic variation is almost surely equal to the length of the time interval:\n$$\n[W,W]_1 = 1, \\quad \\mathbb{P}\\text{-almost surely.}\n$$\nNow, consider the path on which the measure $\\mathbb{Q}$ is concentrated: the zero path $x_0(t)=0$ for all $t \\in [0,1]$. For this path, any increment is zero, so its quadratic variation is:\n$$\n[x_0,x_0]_1 = 0.\n$$\nThis clear distinction allows us to construct a measurable set $S \\subset \\mathcal{C}$ that separates the two measures. Let $S$ be the set of all continuous paths on $[0,1]$ with quadratic variation equal to 1:\n$$\nS = \\{ x \\in \\mathcal{C} \\mid [x,x]_1 = 1 \\}\n$$\nBy the property of Brownian motion, the set of paths generated under $\\mathbb{P}$ falls into $S$ with probability 1. Thus, $\\mathbb{P}(S) = 1$.\nConversely, the path $x_0$ is not in $S$ because its quadratic variation is 0. Since $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the Dirac measure concentrated at $x_0$, we have $\\mathbb{Q}(S) = 0$.\n\nBy definition, two measures $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ are mutually singular ($\\mu \\perp \\nu$) if there exists a measurable set $A$ such that $\\mu(A)=1$ and $\\nu(A)=0$.

Let $X_t$ be a $\\mathbb{P}$-semimartingale with the canonical decomposition $X_t = X_0 + M_t^{\\mathbb{P}} + A_t^{\\mathbb{P}}$, where $M_t^{\\mathbb{P}}$ is a $\\mathbb{P}$-local martingale and $A_t^{\\mathbb{P}}$ is a predictable process of finite variation.

Its canonical decomposition under $\\mathbb{P}$ is $N_t = M_t + A_t$.

Since the processes $Z_{t-}$ and $\\gamma_t$ are predictable, they can be taken outside the compensator operation:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\langle M, Z \\rangle_t = \\text{compensator of}(\\mathrm{d}[M, Z]_t) = \\text{compensator of}(Z_{t-} \\gamma_t \\mathrm{d}[M]_t) = Z_{t-} \\gamma_t \\mathrm{d}\\langle M \\rangle_t\n$$\nThe next step is to find the predictable quadratic variation of $M_t$, denoted $\\langle M \\rangle_t$. The process $M_t$ is $N_t - A_t$. $A_t = \\int_0^t \\lambda_s \\mathrm{d}s$ is a continuous process of finite variation. The optional quadratic variation $[M]_t$ is:\n$$\n[M]_t = [N - A]_t = [N]_t - 2[N, A]_t + [A]_t\n$$\nSince $A_t$ is continuous and of finite variation, $[A]_t = 0$. The covariation $[N, A]_t$ is the sum of products of jumps, $\\sum_{s \\le t} \\Delta N_s \\Delta A_s$. Since $A_t$ is continuous, $\\Delta A_s = 0$ for all $s$, so $[N, A]_t = 0$. Therefore, $[M]_t = [N]_t$.\nFor a simple counting process like $N_t$, its jumps are of size $1$ ($\\Delta N_s = 1$ if a jump occurs at time $s$). The quadratic variation is the sum of the squares of its jumps:\n$$\n[N]_t = \\sum_{0 < s \\le t} (\\Delta N_s)^2 = \\sum_{0 < s \\le t} (1)^2 \\Delta N_s = \\sum_{0 < s \\le t} \\Delta N_s = N_t\n$$\nSo, we have $[M]_t = N_t$.
