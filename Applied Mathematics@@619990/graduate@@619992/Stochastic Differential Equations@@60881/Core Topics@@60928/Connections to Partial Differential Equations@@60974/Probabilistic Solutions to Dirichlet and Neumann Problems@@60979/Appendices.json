All definitions are standard, and the premises are scientifically sound. No inconsistencies, ambiguities, or missing information are present. The problem is valid.

We will first establish that the function $u(x) := \\mathbb{E}_{x}[ g(W_{\\tau}) ]$ is the unique solution to the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation on the unit ball $B$. Then, we will derive the explicit formula for the Poisson kernel $P_d(x, \\zeta)$ which represents this solution.\n\n**Part 1: The Probabilistic Solution to the Dirichlet Problem**\n\nLet $W_t$ be a standard $d$-dimensional Brownian motion starting at $W_0=x \\in B$. Let $\\tau = \\inf\\{t>0 : W_t \\notin B\\}$ be the first exit time from the open unit ball $B$. The function $u(x)$ is defined for $x \\in B$ as the expected value of a continuous function $g$ on the boundary $\\partial B$ evaluated at the exit position $W_\\tau$:\n$$u(x) = \\mathbb{E}_x[g(W_\\tau)]$$\n\nFirst, we establish that $u(x)$ is a harmonic function, i.e., $\\Delta u(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in B$.\nLet $x \\in B$ and choose $r > 0$ small enough such that the closed ball $\\bar{B}_r(x) = \\{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^d : |y-x| \\leq r\\}$ is contained entirely within $B$. Let $\\tau_r = \\inf\\{t>0 : W_t \\notin B_r(x)\\}$ be the first exit time from the open ball $B_r(x)$. Since $\\bar{B}_r(x) \\subset B$, we have $\\tau_r < \\tau$ almost surely.\n\nThe core of the argument rests on the strong Markov property of Brownian motion. This property asserts that, conditioned on the history of the process up to a stopping time $\\tau_r$, the future evolution of the process $W'_{s} := W_{\\tau_r+s}$ for $s \\geq 0$ is a standard Brownian motion starting from the position $W_{\\tau_r}$, and is independent of the history before $\\tau_r$.\n\nWe can rewrite the expectation defining $u(x)$ using the law of total expectation (tower property), conditioning on the information $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_r}$ available at time $\\tau_r$:\n$$u(x) = \\mathbb{E}_x[g(W_\\tau)] = \\mathbb{E}_x\\left[ \\mathbb{E}_x[g(W_\\tau) | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_r}] \\right]$$\nThe inner conditional expectation is an expectation over the future path, which, by the strong Markov property, behaves like a new Brownian motion starting from $W_{\\tau_r}$. The time until this new process exits the larger ball $B$ and the location of its exit are exactly what defines the function $u$ evaluated at the new starting point $W_{\\tau_r}$. Therefore,\n$$\\mathbb{E}_x[g(W_\\tau) | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_r}] = u(W_{\\tau_r})$$\nSubstituting this back, we obtain a crucial identity:\n$$u(x) = \\mathbb{E}_x[u(W_{\\tau_r})]$$\nThis equation states that the value of $u$ at the center $x$ of the ball $B_r(x)$ is the average of its values on the boundary sphere $\\partial B_r(x)$, where the averaging is done with respect to the hitting distribution of Brownian motion on $\\partial B_r(x)$. This is known as the mean value property for the function $u$.\nA continuous function satisfying the mean value property is harmonic. The continuity of $u$ in $B$ follows from the continuous dependence of the law of $W_t$ on its starting point $x$, combined with the fact that $g$ is continuous and bounded. Thus, we conclude that $\\Delta u = 0$ in $B$.\n\nNext, we show that $u$ attains the boundary values $g$ in a continuous sense. We need to show that for any $\\zeta_0 \\in \\partial B$, we have $\\lim_{x \\to \\zeta_0} u(x) = g(\\zeta_0)$.\nLet $x \\in B$ approach $\\zeta_0 \\in \\partial B$. Intuitively, a Brownian motion starting very close to the boundary is highly likely to exit the domain very quickly and very near its starting point. Let $\\epsilon > 0$. Since $g$ is continuous on the compact set $\\partial B$, it is uniformly continuous. Thus, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that for any $\\zeta_1, \\zeta_2 \\in \\partial B$ with $|\\zeta_1 - \\zeta_2| < \\delta$, we have $|g(\\zeta_1) - g(\\zeta_2)| < \\epsilon/2$.\nWe can choose $x$ close enough to $\\zeta_0$ such that the probability of the exit point $W_\\tau$ being far from $\\zeta_0$ is very small. That is, for $|x-\\zeta_0|$ small enough, $\\mathbb{P}_x(|W_\\tau - \\zeta_0| \\geq \\delta)$ can be made arbitrarily small. Let $M = \\sup_{\\zeta \\in \\partial B} |g(\\zeta)|$.\nThen we have:\n$$|u(x) - g(\\zeta_0)| = |\\mathbb{E}_x[g(W_\\tau) - g(\\zeta_0)]| \\leq \\mathbb{E}_x[|g(W_\\tau) - g(\\zeta_0)|]$$\nWe split the expectation over two events: $A = \\{|W_\\tau - \\zeta_0| < \\delta\\}$ and its complement $A^c$.\n$$\\mathbb{E}_x[|g(W_\\tau) - g(\\zeta_0)|] = \\mathbb{E}_x[|g(W_\\tau) - g(\\zeta_0)| \\mathbf{1}_{A}] + \\mathbb{E}_x[|g(W_\\tau) - g(\\zeta_0)| \\mathbf{1}_{A^c}]$$\nOn event $A$, $|g(W_\\tau) - g(\\zeta_0)| < \\epsilon/2$. On event $A^c$, we use the bound $|g(W_\\tau) - g(\\zeta_0)| \\leq 2M$.\n$$|u(x) - g(\\zeta_0)| \\leq \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} \\mathbb{P}_x(A) + 2M \\mathbb{P}_x(A^c) \\leq \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} + 2M \\mathbb{P}_x(A^c)$$\nFor $x$ sufficiently close to $\\zeta_0$, we can ensure $\\mathbb{P}_x(A^c) < \\epsilon/(4M)$. Then $|u(x) - g(\\zeta_0)| < \\epsilon/2 + \\epsilon/2 = \\epsilon$. This proves that $\\lim_{x \\to \\zeta_0} u(x) = g(\\zeta_0)$.\n\n**Part 2: The Poisson Kernel Derivation**\n\nWe have established that $u(x) = \\mathbb{E}_x[g(W_\\tau)]$ is the solution to the Dirichlet problem:\n$$ \\begin{cases} \\Delta u = 0 & \\text{in } B \\\\ u = g & \\text{on } \\partial B \\end{cases} $$\nThe functional $g \\mapsto u(x)$ is linear and continuous on $C(\\partial B)$. By the Riesz representation theorem, for each $x \\in B$, there exists a unique finite Borel measure $\\mu_x$ on $\\partial B$ such that $u(x) = \\int_{\\partial B} g(\\zeta) d\\mu_x(\\zeta)$. This measure, $\\mu_x$, is the distribution of the exit point $W_\\tau$ conditional on $W_0=x$. The problem states that this measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the surface measure $\\sigma$ on $\\partial B$. The corresponding density is the Poisson kernel $P_d(x,\\zeta)$:\n$$u(x) = \\int_{\\partial B} g(\\zeta) P_d(x,\\zeta) d\\sigma(\\zeta)$$\nFrom potential theory, the solution to the Dirichlet problem can also be expressed using the Green's function $G_B(x,y)$ for the Laplacian on the ball $B$:\n$$ u(x) = -\\int_{\\partial B} g(y) \\frac{\\partial G_B}{\\partial n_y}(x,y) d\\sigma(y) $$\nwhere $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_y}$ denotes the derivative in the direction of the outward unit normal to $\\partial B$ at $y$. Thus, the Poisson kernel is given by $P_d(x,y) = -\\frac{\\partial G_B}{\\partial n_y}(x,y)$.\n\nFor the unit ball $B$ in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ and a point $x \\in B$, the Green's function is constructed using the method of images. For $d > 2$, it is given by:\n$$ G_B(x,y) = \\Phi(y-x) - \\Phi(|x|(y-x^*)) $$\nwhere $\\Phi(z) = \\frac{1}{(d-2)S_d}|z|^{2-d}$ is the fundamental solution of the Laplacian, $x^* = x/|x|^2$ is the inversion of $x$ with respect to $\\partial B$, and $S_d$ is the surface area of the unit sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^d$.\nFor a point $y = \\zeta \\in \\partial B$, we have $|\\zeta|=1$. The outward unit normal is $n_\\zeta = \\zeta$. We calculate the normal derivative:\n$$ P_d(x,\\zeta) = - \\zeta \\cdot \\nabla_\\zeta G_B(x,\\zeta) $$\nLet's compute the gradient with respect to $\\zeta$:\n$$ \\nabla_\\zeta G_B(x,\\zeta) = \\frac{1}{(d-2)S_d} \\nabla_\\zeta \\left( | \\zeta-x |^{2-d} - |x|^{2-d} | \\zeta-x^* |^{2-d} \\right) $$\nUsing $\\nabla|z|^p = p|z|^{p-2}z$, we have:\n$$ \\nabla_\\zeta |\\zeta-x|^{2-d} = (2-d)|\\zeta-x|^{-d}(\\zeta-x) $$\n$$ \\nabla_\\zeta |\\zeta-x^*|^{2-d} = (2-d)|\\zeta-x^*|^{-d}(\\zeta-x^*) $$\nTaking the dot product with $\\zeta$:\n$$ \\zeta \\cdot \\nabla_\\zeta G_B(x,\\zeta) = \\frac{2-d}{(d-2)S_d} \\left( \\frac{\\zeta \\cdot (\\zeta-x)}{|\\zeta-x|^d} - |x|^{2-d} \\frac{\\zeta \\cdot (\\zeta-x^*)}{|\\zeta-x^*|^d} \\right) $$\nWe use the facts that for $\\zeta \\in \\partial B$, $|\\zeta|=1$, and the geometric identity $|\\zeta-x^*| = \\frac{|\\zeta-x|}{|x|}$.\nThe terms in the numerator become:\n$$ \\zeta \\cdot (\\zeta-x) = |\\zeta|^2 - \\zeta \\cdot x = 1 - \\zeta \\cdot x $$\n$$ \\zeta \\cdot (\\zeta-x^*) = |\\zeta|^2 - \\zeta \\cdot x^* = 1 - \\frac{\\zeta \\cdot x}{|x|^2} $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for the normal derivative:\n$$ \\zeta \\cdot \\nabla_\\zeta G_B(x,\\zeta) = -\\frac{1}{S_d} \\left( \\frac{1 - \\zeta \\cdot x}{|\\zeta-x|^d} - |x|^{2-d} \\frac{1 - (\\zeta \\cdot x)/|x|^2}{(|\\zeta-x|/|x|)^d} \\right) $$\n$$ = -\\frac{1}{S_d |\\zeta-x|^d} \\left( (1 - \\zeta \\cdot x) - |x|^{2-d} |x|^d (1 - (\\zeta \\cdot x)/|x|^2) \\right) $$\n$$ = -\\frac{1}{S_d |\\zeta-x|^d} \\left( 1 - \\zeta \\cdot x - |x|^2(1 - (\\zeta \\cdot x)/|x|^2) \\right) $$\n$$ = -\\frac{1}{S_d |\\zeta-x|^d} \\left( 1 - \\zeta \\cdot x - |x|^2 + \\zeta \\cdot x \\right) = -\\frac{1}{S_d} \\frac{1-|x|^2}{|\\zeta-x|^d} $$\nTherefore, the Poisson kernel is:\n$$ P_d(x,\\zeta) = - \\left(-\\frac{1}{S_d} \\frac{1-|x|^2}{|x-\\zeta|^d}\\right) = \\frac{1}{S_d} \\frac{1-|x|^2}{|x-\\zeta|^d} $$\nThis derivation holds for $d > 2$. A similar derivation for $d=2$ starting from the logarithmic potential $\\Phi(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\ln|z|$ yields $P_2(x,\\zeta) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\frac{1-|x|^2}{|x-\\zeta|^2}$, which matches the general formula since $S_2=2\\pi$.\n\nThe surface area of the unit sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ is $S_d = \\frac{2\\pi^{d/2}}{\\Gamma(d/2)}$. Substituting this gives the final expression for the Poisson kernel.\n\n$$ P_d(x,\\zeta) = \\frac{\\Gamma(d/2)}{2\\pi^{d/2}} \\frac{1-|x|^2}{|x-\\zeta|^d} $$\nThis is the unique function that satisfies the required properties.

I will now proceed with the derivation of the solution and the evaluation of the options.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem asks for properties of the function $u(x)$ that is harmonic in $D$ ($\\Delta u = 0$) and satisfies the given boundary conditions. The domain is a wedge with angle $\\alpha=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$. The boundary conditions are $u(r,0)=0$, $u(r, \\frac{3\\pi}{2})=0$, and $u(1, \\theta) = \\sin(\\frac{2\\theta}{3})$.\n\nWe use the method of separation of variables, as suggested. The general solution for a harmonic function in a wedge with zero boundary conditions on the straight sides is given as a superposition of basis functions:\n$$u(r,\\theta) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} c_k r^{k\\pi/\\alpha} \\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{\\alpha}\\theta\\right)$$\nThe solution must be bounded at the origin ($r=0$), which is why we exclude terms with negative powers of $r$.\n\nIn our case, the angle is $\\alpha=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$. Substituting this value into the general form gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\pi}{3\\pi/2} = \\frac{2}{3} $$\nSo the solution has the form:\n$$ u(r,\\theta) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} c_k r^{2k/3} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2k}{3}\\theta\\right) $$\nNow, we must satisfy the boundary condition on the circular arc at $r=1$:\n$$ u(1,\\theta) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} c_k \\sin\\left(\\frac{2k}{3}\\theta\\right) = g(1,\\theta) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\theta\\right) $$\nBy comparing the Fourier sine series on the left with the function on the right, we can identify the coefficients $c_k$. The boundary data is exactly the first basis function (for $k=1$). By inspection, we must have:\n$$ c_1=1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c_k = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\ge 2 $$\nTherefore, the unique solution to the Dirichlet problem is:\n$$ u(r,\\theta) = 1 \\cdot r^{2/3} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\theta\\right) = r^{2/3} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\theta\\right) $$\n\nWe now analyze the properties of this function to evaluate the given options.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The function $u$ extends continuously to $\\overline{D}$ but is not $C^{1}$ up to the boundary; specifically, its gradient $\\nabla u$ blows up at the corner $r=0$.**\n\nFirst, let's check continuity. The function $u(r,\\theta) = r^{2/3} \\sin(\\frac{2}{3}\\theta)$ is a product of $r^{2/3}$ and a bounded function $\\sin(\\frac{2}{3}\\theta)$. As $r \\downarrow 0$, $r^{2/3} \\to 0$, so $\\lim_{r\\to 0} u(r,\\theta) = 0$. This matches the boundary value at the corner, $g(0,0)=0$. The function is continuous on the entire closed domain $\\overline{D}$.\n\nNext, let's analyze its gradient, $\\nabla u$. In polar coordinates, the gradient is $\\nabla u = (\\partial_r u)\\mathbf{\\hat{r}} + \\frac{1}{r}(\\partial_\\theta u)\\mathbf{\\hat{\\theta}}$.\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$ \\partial_r u = \\frac{2}{3} r^{-1/3} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\theta\\right) $$\n$$ \\partial_\\theta u = \\frac{2}{3} r^{2/3} \\cos\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\theta\\right) $$\nThe magnitude of the gradient is:\n$$ |\\nabla u| = \\sqrt{(\\partial_r u)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\partial_\\theta u\\right)^2} $$\n$$ |\\nabla u| = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{2}{3} r^{-1/3} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\theta\\right)\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{r} \\frac{2}{3} r^{2/3} \\cos\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\theta\\right)\\right)^2} $$\n$$ |\\nabla u| = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{2}{3} r^{-1/3}\\right)^2 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\theta\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2}{3} r^{-1/3}\\right)^2 \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\theta\\right)} $$\n$$ |\\nabla u| = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{2}{3} r^{-1/3}\\right)^2 \\left(\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\theta\\right) + \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\theta\\right)\\right)} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{2}{3} r^{-1/3}\\right)^2} = \\frac{2}{3} r^{-1/3} $$\nAs $r\\downarrow 0$, $|\\nabla u| = \\frac{2}{3} r^{-1/3} \\to \\infty$. The gradient blows up at the corner $r=0$. This implies the function is not $C^1$ on $\\overline{D}$.\n\nThe statement is **Correct**.\n\n**B. The function $u$ fails to be continuous at the corner because $2$-dimensional Brownian motion hits the corner point with positive probability before exiting elsewhere.**\n\nAs established in the analysis of option A, the function $u(r,\\theta) = r^{2/3} \\sin(\\frac{2}{3}\\theta)$ is continuous at the corner $r=0$. The first part of the statement is false.\nThe reason given is also false. A classic result of stochastic analysis (Wiener's test) states that a point on the boundary of a domain is \"regular\" (i.e., hit with probability $1$ by a Brownian motion starting nearby) if and only if a certain capacity criterion is met. For a wedge with interior angle $\\alpha$, the corner is regular if and only if $\\alpha \\le \\pi$. In this problem, the angle is $\\alpha=\\frac{3\\pi}{2} > \\pi$. This is a re-entrant corner, which is an \"irregular\" point for the Dirichlet problem in $2$D. This means that a $2$-dimensional Brownian motion started in $D$ has a probability of $0$ of hitting the corner at $r=0$ before exiting through another part of the boundary.\n\nThe statement is false on two counts: the function *is* continuous, and the Brownian motion does *not* hit the corner with positive probability.\n\nThe statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. As $r\\downarrow 0$, one has the precise rate $|\\nabla u(r,\\theta)|=\\tfrac{2}{3}\\,r^{-1/3}$ for all $\\theta\\in(0,\\tfrac{3\\pi}{2})$.**\n\nIn the analysis for option A, we computed the exact magnitude of the gradient for any $r>0$ and $\\theta \\in (0, \\frac{3\\pi}{2})$ to be:\n$$ |\\nabla u(r,\\theta)| = \\frac{2}{3} r^{-1/3} $$\nThis expression is not an approximation or an asymptotic relation; it is an equality. Thus, it certainly represents the \"precise rate\" of blowup as $r\\downarrow 0$.\n\nThe statement is **Correct**.\n\n**D. The function $u$ solves $\\Delta u=0$ in $D$, attains the boundary values $g$ on $\\partial D$, and satisfies the probabilistic representation $u(x)=\\mathbb{E}^{x}\\!\\big[g(B_{\\tau_D})\\big]$ for all $x\\in D$.**\n\nThis statement summarizes the properties of the solution to the Dirichlet problem. Let's verify each part for the function $u(r,\\theta) = r^{2/3}\\sin(\\frac{2}{3}\\theta)$ we found.\n1.  $u$ solves $\\Delta u=0$ in $D$: The function was constructed as a linear combination of harmonic functions from separation of variables, so it must be harmonic. A direct check also confirms this: $\\Delta u = u_{rr} + \\frac{1}{r}u_r + \\frac{1}{r^2}u_{\\theta\\theta} = (-\\frac{2}{9}r^{-4/3} + \\frac{2}{3}r^{-4/3} - \\frac{4}{9}r^{-4/3})\\sin(\\frac{2}{3}\\theta) = 0$.\n2.  $u$ attains the boundary values $g$ on $\\partial D$: By construction, $u(r,0)=0$, $u(r,\\frac{3\\pi}{2})=0$, and $u(1,\\theta)=\\sin(\\frac{2\\theta}{3})$. As shown for A, $u$ is continuous on $\\overline{D}$ and matches the value at the corner. So it attains the continuous boundary function $g$ everywhere on $\\partial D$.\n3.  $u(x)=\\mathbb{E}^{x}\\!\\big[g(B_{\\tau_D})\\big]$: The problem statement itself posits that the probabilistic solution $u(x)=\\mathbb{E}^{x}\\!\\big[g(B_{\\tau_D})\\big]$ is the unique continuous function on $\\overline{D}$ that is harmonic in $D$ and agrees with $g$ on the boundary. Since we have found exactly such a function (and uniqueness is guaranteed), our function must be identical to the probabilistic one. This is a fundamental tenet of the theory.\n\nAll three clauses of the statement are true.\n\nThe statement is **Correct**.\n\n**E.

It constitutes a standard, non-trivial problem in stochastic calculus.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the ODE and Boundary Conditions**\n\nAn eigenfunction $u(x)$ of the semigroup $T_t$ with eigenvalue $\\exp(-\\lambda t)$ satisfies $T_t u(x) = \\exp(-\\lambda t) u(x)$. By definition, $T_t u(x) = \\mathbb{E}^{x}[M_t u(X_t)]$. Combining these, we have $\\mathbb{E}^{x}[M_t u(X_t)] = \\exp(-\\lambda t) u(x)$, which can be rewritten as $\\mathbb{E}^{x}[\\exp(\\lambda t) M_t u(X_t)] = u(x)$. This implies that the process $Z_t = \\exp(\\lambda t) M_t u(X_t)$ is a martingale under the measure $\\mathbb{P}^x$. For $Z_t$ to be a martingale, its drift part (the finite variation part of its dynamics) must be zero.\n\nWe apply Itô's formula to $Z_t$. First, let's find the dynamics of $M_t u(X_t)$. The process $X_t$ is a semimartingale given by the Skorokhod problem:\n$$dX_t = dW_t + dL_t^0 - dL_t^1$$\nwhere $W_t$ is a standard Brownian motion and $L_t^0, L_t^1$ are the local times at the boundaries. The quadratic variation is $d\\langle X, X \\rangle_t = d\\langle W, W \\rangle_t = dt$.\nThe killing functional is $M_t = \\exp(-\\kappa(L_t^0 + L_t^1))$, so its differential is\n$$dM_t = -\\kappa M_t (dL_t^0 + dL_t^1)$$\nLet $u$ be a $C^2$ function on $[0,1]$. By the generalized Itô formula for a function of a semimartingale, we have for $u(X_t)$:\n$$du(X_t) = u'(X_t) dX_t + \\frac{1}{2} u''(X_t) d\\langle X, X \\rangle_t$$\nSubstituting $dX_t$ and $d\\langle X,X \\rangle_t$:\n$$du(X_t) = u'(X_t)dW_t + \\frac{1}{2}u''(X_t)dt + u'(X_t)dL_t^0 - u'(X_t)dL_t^1$$\nNow we use the Itô product rule for $M_t u(X_t)$. Since $M_t$ is a process of finite variation, the quadratic covariation term $d\\langle M, u(X) \\rangle_t$ is zero.\n$$d(M_t u(X_t)) = M_{t-} du(X_t) + u(X_{t-}) dM_t$$\nAs all processes are continuous, we can write $M_t$ and $u(X_t)$:\n$$d(M_t u(X_t)) = M_t du(X_t) + u(X_t) dM_t$$\nSubstituting the differentials:\n$$d(M_t u(X_t)) = M_t \\left( u'(X_t)dW_t + \\frac{1}{2}u''(X_t)dt + u'(X_t)dL_t^0 - u'(X_t)dL_t^1 \\right) + u(X_t) \\left( -\\kappa M_t (dL_t^0 + dL_t^1) \\right)$$\nCombining terms with respect to $dt$, $dW_t$, $dL_t^0$, and $dL_t^1$:\n$$d(M_t u(X_t)) = M_t u'(X_t) dW_t + \\frac{1}{2} M_t u''(X_t) dt + M_t (u'(X_t) - \\kappa u(X_t)) dL_t^0 - M_t (u'(X_t) + \\kappa u(X_t)) dL_t^1$$\nFinally, we apply the product rule to $Z_t = \\exp(\\lambda t) M_t u(X_t)$:\n$$dZ_t = \\lambda \\exp(\\lambda t) M_t u(X_t) dt + \\exp(\\lambda t) d(M_t u(X_t))$$\nSubstituting the expression for $d(M_t u(X_t))$:\n$$dZ_t = \\exp(\\lambda t) M_t u'(X_t) dW_t + \\exp(\\lambda t) M_t \\left( \\frac{1}{2} u''(X_t) + \\lambda u(X_t) \\right) dt$$\n$$+ \\exp(\\lambda t) M_t (u'(X_t) - \\kappa u(X_t)) dL_t^0 - \\exp(\\lambda t) M_t (u'(X_t) + \\kappa u(X_t)) dL_t^1$$\nFor $Z_t$ to be a martingale, the finite variation part (all terms except the $dW_t$ term) must be zero.\nThe $dt$ term must be zero for all paths, which implies that for $x \\in (0,1)$, its coefficient must be zero:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} u''(x) + \\lambda u(x) = 0$$\nThe term with $dL_t^0$ is non-zero only when $X_t = 0$. For the integral to be zero, its coefficient must vanish at $x=0$:\n$$u'(0) - \\kappa u(0) = 0 \\implies u'(0) = \\kappa u(0)$$\nThe term with $dL_t^1$ is non-zero only when $X_t = 1$. For the integral to be zero, its coefficient must vanish at $x=1$:\n$$u'(1) + \\kappa u(1) = 0 \\implies u'(1) = -\\kappa u(1)$$\nThese are the sought-after ODE and Robin boundary conditions.\n\n**Solving the Boundary Value Problem for $\\kappa = \\pi/2$**\n\nThe ODE is $u''(x) + 2\\lambda u(x) = 0$. With $\\lambda > 0$, we can set $\\omega^2 = 2\\lambda$ where $\\omega > 0$. The ODE becomes $u''(x) + \\omega^2 u(x) = 0$.\nThe general solution is $u(x) = A \\cos(\\omega x) + B \\sin(\\omega x)$.\nThe derivative is $u'(x) = -A\\omega \\sin(\\omega x) + B\\omega \\cos(\\omega x)$.\n\nWe apply the boundary conditions with $\\kappa = \\pi/2$:\n1.

We seek the smallest positive solution $\\omega_0$, which will correspond to the nonnegative principal eigenfunction. By inspection, we test $\\omega = \\pi/2$:\n$(\\frac{\\pi^2}{4} - (\\frac{\\pi}{2})^2)\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) + \\pi(\\frac{\\pi}{2})\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = (0)(1) + \\frac{\\pi^2}{2}(0) = 0$.\nSo, $\\omega = \\pi/2$ is a solution. This corresponds to the principal eigenvalue $\\lambda = \\omega^2/2 = (\\pi/2)^2/2 = \\pi^2/8$.\n\nWith $\\omega = \\pi/2$ and $\\kappa = \\pi/2$, the condition $B\\omega = \\kappa A$ becomes $B(\\pi/2) = (\\pi/2)A$, which implies $B=A$.\nThe eigenfunction is of the form $u(x) = A(\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}x) + \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}x))$.\nTo be nonnegative on $[0,1]$, we note that $u(x)$ can be written as $A\\sqrt{2}\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}x + \\frac{\\pi}{4})$. For $x \\in [0,1]$, the argument $\\frac{\\pi}{2}x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ ranges from $\\pi/4$ to $3\\pi/4$. The sine function is positive on this interval. Thus, by choosing $A > 0$, the eigenfunction is strictly positive on $[0,1]$. This is the eigenfunction corresponding to the quasi-stationary distribution.\n\n**Normalization and Interpretation**\nThe problem asks for $u(x)$ to be a normalized density, which means its integral over $[0,1]$ must be $1$.
