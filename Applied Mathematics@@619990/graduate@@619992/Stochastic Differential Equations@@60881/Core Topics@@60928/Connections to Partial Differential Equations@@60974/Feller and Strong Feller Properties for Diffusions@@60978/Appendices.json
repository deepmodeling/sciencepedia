We want to show $(P_{t}f)(x_{n}, y_{n}) \\to (P_{t}f)(x, y)$. The function $h(x', y', z) = f(z, y') \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(z-x')^{2}}{2t}\\right)$ is continuous in $(x', y')$ for each fixed $z$. Also, $|h(x', y', z)| \\le \\|f\\|_{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(z-x')^{2}}{2t}\\right)$. Since $f$ is bounded, and the Gaussian kernel is integrable with respect to $z$ (with integral $1$), we can apply the Dominated Convergence Theorem to show that $(P_{t}f)(x,y)$ is continuous in $(x,y)$.\nVanishing at infinity: We need to show $\\lim_{|(x,y)| \\to \\infty} (P_{t}f)(x,y) = 0$.\nCase 1: $|y| \\to \\infty$. Since $f \\in C_{0}(\\mathbb{R}^{2})$, for any $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $M$ such that $|f(z,y)| < \\varepsilon$ for all $z$ whenever $|y|>M$. Thus, for $|y|>M$,\n$$\n|(P_{t}f)(x,y)| \\le \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |f(z,y)| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(z-x)^{2}}{2t}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}z < \\varepsilon \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(z-x)^{2}}{2t}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}z = \\varepsilon.\n$$\nThis shows $(P_{t}f)(x,y) \\to 0$ as $|y| \\to \\infty$, uniformly in $x$.\nCase 2: $y$ remains in a bounded set, and $|x| \\to \\infty$. For any $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $R$ such that $|f(z,y)| < \\varepsilon$ for all $y$ in the bounded set whenever $|z|>R$. We split the integral:\n$$\n|(P_{t}f)(x,y)| \\le \\int_{|z|\\le R} |f(z,y)| \\frac{...}{...} \\,\\mathrm{d}z + \\int_{|z|> R} |f(z,y)| \\frac{...}{...} \\,\\mathrm{d}z.\n$$\nThe second term is bounded by $\\varepsilon$. The first term is bounded by\n$$\n\\|f\\|_{\\infty} \\int_{-R}^{R} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(z-x)^{2}}{2t}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}z.\n$$\nAs $|x|\\to\\infty$, the interval $[-R, R]$ moves away from $x$, and the integral of the Gaussian kernel over this fixed-length interval tends to $0$. Thus, $(P_{t}f)(x,y) \\to 0$.\nSo, $P_{t}f \\in C_{0}(\\mathbb{R}^{2})$.\n\nSecond, we show that $(P_{t})_{t\\ge 0}$ is strongly continuous on $C_{0}(\\mathbb{R}^{2})$ at $t=0$, i.e., $\\lim_{t\\downarrow 0} \\|P_{t}f - f\\|_{\\infty} = 0$ for all $f \\in C_{0}(\\mathbb{R}^{2})$.\n$$\n|(P_{t}f)(x,y) - f(x,y)| = \\left|\\mathbb{E}[f(x+W_{t}, y)] - f(x,y)\\right| \\le \\mathbb{E}[|f(x+W_{t}, y) - f(x,y)|].\n$$\nSince $f \\in C_{0}(\\mathbb{R}^{2})$, it is uniformly continuous on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. For any $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that if $\\|(z_{1},y_{1})-(z_{2},y_{2})\\| < \\delta$, then $|f(z_{1},y_{1})-f(z_{2},y_{2})| < \\varepsilon/2$. Here we only change the first coordinate, so if $|w| < \\delta$, then $|f(x+w,y)-f(x,y)| < \\varepsilon/2$.\nWe write\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[|f(x+W_{t}, y) - f(x,y)|] = \\mathbb{E}[|f(x+W_{t}, y) - f(x,y)| \\mathbf{1}_{\\{|W_{t}|<\\delta\\}}] + \\mathbb{E}[|f(x+W_{t}, y) - f(x,y)| \\mathbf{1}_{\\{|W_{t}|\\ge\\delta\\}}].\n$$\nThe first term is less than $\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}\\mathbb{P}(|W_{t}|<\\delta) \\le \\varepsilon/2$.\nThe second term is bounded by $2\\|f\\|_{\\infty}\\mathbb{P}(|W_{t}|\\ge\\delta)$. Since $W_{t} = \\sqrt{t} W_{1}$, where $W_{1}$ is a standard normal variable, $\\mathbb{P}(|W_{t}|\\ge\\delta) = \\mathbb{P}(|\\sqrt{t}W_{1}|\\ge\\delta) = \\mathbb{P}(|W_{1}|\\ge \\delta/\\sqrt{t})$. As $t\\downarrow 0$, $\\delta/\\sqrt{t} \\to \\infty$, so $\\mathbb{P}(|W_{1}|\\ge \\delta/\\sqrt{t}) \\to 0$. We can choose $t$ small enough so $2\\|f\\|_{\\infty}\\mathbb{P}(|W_{t}|\\ge\\delta) < \\varepsilon/2$.\nThus, for $t$ small enough, $|(P_{t}f)(x,y) - f(x,y)| < \\varepsilon$ uniformly in $(x,y)$.\nThis completes the proof that $(P_{t})_{t\\ge 0}$ is a Feller semigroup.\n\n(b) To prove that $(P_{t})_{t\\ge 0}$ is not strong Feller, we must find a bounded measurable function $g$ such that for some $t>0$, $P_{t}g$ is not a continuous function. The strong Feller property requires that $P_{t}$ maps the space of all bounded measurable functions $B(\\mathbb{R}^{2})$ into the space of bounded continuous functions $C_{b}(\\mathbb{R}^{2})$.\nLet's consider the function suggested in part (c), $g(x,y) = \\mathbf{1}_{\\{y\\ge 0\\}}$. This function is bounded and measurable, but it is not continuous along the line $y=0$.\nFor any $t>0$, let's compute $(P_{t}g)(x,y)$.\n$$\n(P_{t}g)(x,y) = \\mathbb{E}^{(x,y)}[g(X_{t},Y_{t})] = \\mathbb{E}[g(x+W_{t}, y)].\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of $g$,\n$$\n(P_{t}g)(x,y) = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{1}_{\\{y\\ge 0\\}}].\n$$\nThe expression $\\mathbf{1}_{\\{y\\ge 0\\}}$ depends only on the initial value $y$ and not on the random variable $W_{t}$. Therefore, it is a constant with respect to the expectation.\n$$\n(P_{t}g)(x,y) = \\mathbf{1}_{\\{y\\ge 0\\}} = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } y \\ge 0 \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } y < 0 \\end{cases}.\n$$\nThe function $(x,y) \\mapsto (P_{t}g)(x,y)$ is equal to $g(x,y)$ itself. This function is not continuous for any $(x,0)$ on the $x$-axis. For instance, for any fixed $x$, $\\lim_{y\\downarrow 0} (P_{t}g)(x,y) = 1$ while $\\lim_{y\\uparrow 0} (P_{t}g)(x,y) = 0$.\nSince we found a bounded measurable function $g$ for which $P_{t}g$ is not continuous for any $t>0$, the semigroup $(P_{t})_{t\\ge 0}$ is not strong Feller. The degeneracy of the diffusion (no noise in the $y$-direction) prevents smoothing of discontinuities along the $y$-axis.\n\n(c) We are asked to compute the jump $J(t)$ for the function $g(x,y)=\\mathbf{1}_{\\{y\\ge 0\\}}$.\n$$\nJ(t) = \\lim_{y\\downarrow 0}(P_{t}g)(x,y) - \\lim_{y\\uparrow 0}(P_{t}g)(x,y).\n$$\nFrom part (b), we have the explicit expression for $(P_{t}g)(x,y)$ for any $t>0$ and any $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$:\n$$\n(P_{t}g)(x,y) = \\mathbf{1}_{\\{y\\ge 0\\}}.\n$$\nThe limits are straightforward to compute.\nFor the limit from above ($y\\downarrow 0$), we consider values of $y>0$.

For example, $[V_1, [V_0, V_1]] = [V_1, 0] = 0$.\nTherefore, the Lie algebra is simply the linear span of the initial vector fields:\n$$\n\\text{Lie}(V_0, V_1) = \\text{span}\\{V_0, V_1\\}\n$$\nTo check Hörmander's condition at a point $(x_p, y_p)$, we must evaluate the vector fields in the Lie algebra at that point and determine the dimension of the resulting subspace of the tangent space $T_{(x_p, y_p)}\\mathbb{R}^2 \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$.\nHörmander's condition holds at $(x_p, y_p)$ if $\\text{dim}(\\text{Lie}(V_0, V_1)|_{(x_p, y_p)}) = 2$, which is the dimension of the state space $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nThe problem asks to check the condition at a point $(x,0)$. At any such point, the vector fields evaluate to:\n$$\nV_{0}(x,0) = (0,0)\n$$\n$$\nV_{1}(x,0) = (0,0)\n$$\nThe space spanned by these vectors at $(x,0)$ is:\n$$\n\\text{Lie}(V_0, V_1)|_{(x,0)} = \\text{span}\\{(0,0), (0,0)\\} = \\{(0,0)\\}\n$$\nThe dimension of this space is $0$. Since $0 \\neq 2$, Hörmander’s bracket condition fails at all points on the line $y=0$, including any point of the form $(x,0)$.\n\n**2. Semigroup Computation and Continuity Analysis**\n\nFirst, we solve the SDE system. The equation for $Y_t$ is $dY_t = 0$, which implies $Y_t$ is constant:\n$$\nY_{t} = Y_{0} = y\n$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $X_t$:\n$$\ndX_{t} = y\\, dW_{t}\n$$\nIntegrating from $0$ to $t$ gives:\n$$\nX_{t} - X_{0} = \\int_{0}^{t} y\\, dW_{s} = y \\int_{0}^{t} dW_{s} = y W_t\n$$\nThus, the solution to the SDE system starting from $(x,y)$ is:\n$$\n(X_{t}, Y_{t}) = (x + y W_{t}, y)\n$$\nThe Markov semigroup $P_t$ is defined by $P_{t}f(x,y) = \\mathbb{E}[f(X_{t}, Y_{t}) \\mid (X_{0},Y_{0}) = (x,y)]$. We use the test function $f(u,v) = \\mathbf{1}_{\\{u=0\\}}$, which is $1$ if $u=0$ and $0$ otherwise.\n\nWe compute $P_{t}f(0,y)$ for a fixed $t > 0$. The initial condition is $(X_0, Y_0) = (0,y)$. The solution is $(X_t, Y_t) = (y W_t, y)$.\n$$\nP_{t}f(0,y) = \\mathbb{E}[f(y W_t, y)] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{1}_{\\{y W_t = 0\\}}] = \\mathbb{P}(y W_t = 0)\n$$\nWe consider two cases for $y$:\nCase 1: $y \\neq 0$.\nThe condition $y W_t = 0$ is equivalent to $W_t = 0$. The random variable $W_t$ follows a normal distribution $N(0,t)$. For any continuous random variable, the probability of it taking a specific value is zero. Therefore, $\\mathbb{P}(W_t = 0) = 0$.\nSo, for $y \\neq 0$, $P_{t}f(0,y) = 0$.\n\nCase 2: $y = 0$.\nThe initial condition is $(X_0, Y_0) = (0,0)$. The SDE solution is $(X_t, Y_t) = (0 + 0 \\cdot W_t, 0) = (0,0)$ for all $t \\geq 0$. The process is deterministic and remains at the origin.\nThen, we compute $P_t f(0,0)$:\n$$\nP_{t}f(0,0) = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{1}_{\\{X_t = 0\\}} \\mid (X_0,Y_0)=(0,0)] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{1}_{\\{0=0\\}}] = \\mathbb{E}[1] = 1\n$$\nSo, we have $P_{t}f(0,0) = 1$.\n\nTo assess the continuity of the function $g(x,y) = P_t f(x,y)$ at the point $(0,0)$, we can examine the limit as $(x,y) \\to (0,0)$ and compare it with the value $g(0,0)$. Let's consider the limit along the path where $x=0$ and $y \\to 0$:\n$$\n\\lim_{y \\to 0} P_{t}f(0,y) = \\lim_{y \\to 0, y \\neq 0} P_{t}f(0,y) = \\lim_{y \\to 0, y \\neq 0} 0 = 0\n$$\nWe have found that $\\lim_{y \\to 0} P_t f(0,y) = 0$, while $P_t f(0,0) = 1$. Since the limit does not equal the function's value at the point, the function $P_t f$ is not continuous at $(0,0)$.\n\nThe strong Feller property for a Markov semigroup requires that $P_t f$ is a continuous function for any bounded measurable function $f$. We have found a bounded measurable function $f(u,v) = \\mathbf{1}_{\\{u=0\\}}$ for which $P_t f$ is not continuous. This demonstrates that the process does not possess the strong Feller property. This failure is a direct consequence of the degeneracy of the diffusion, which is precisely what the failure of Hörmander's condition at points on the $x$-axis indicated.\n\n**3. Computation of the Limit**\n\nWe are asked to compute the limit:\n$$\nL = \\lim_{y \\to 0} \\big( P_{t} f(0,y) - P_{t} f(0,0) \\big)\n$$\nThe limit as $y \\to 0$ considers values of $y$ in a punctured neighborhood of $0$, i.e., $y \\neq 0$.\nFrom our analysis in Part 2, we have:\n- For $y \\neq 0$, $P_{t}f(0,y) = 0$.\n- The value at $y=0$ is $P_{t}f(0,0) = 1$.\n\nWe substitute these into the expression inside the limit. For any $y \\neq 0$, the expression is:\n$$\nP_{t} f(0,y) - P_{t} f(0,0) = 0 - 1 = -1\n$$\nThe limit of a constant function is the constant itself. Therefore:\n$$\nL = \\lim_{y \\to 0} (-1) = -1\n$$\nThe value of the limit is $-1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1}$$", "id": "2976256"}]}
