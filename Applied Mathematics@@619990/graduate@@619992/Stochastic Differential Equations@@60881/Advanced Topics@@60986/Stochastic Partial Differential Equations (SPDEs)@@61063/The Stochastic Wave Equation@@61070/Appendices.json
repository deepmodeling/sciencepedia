A forward fundamental solution $G$ is a distribution satisfying $L G = \\delta_{(0,0)}$, where $\\delta_{(0,0)}$ is the Dirac delta distribution centered at the origin $(t,x)=(0,0)$. The defining property is $\\langle G, L\\varphi \\rangle = \\varphi(0,0)$ for all test functions $\\varphi \\in \\mathcal{D}(\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R})$. The support of $G$ is specified to be in the forward light cone, i.e., $G(t,x)=0$ for $t < 0$.\n\nWe consider the inhomogeneous initial value problem with zero initial data:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nL v(t,x) = f(t,x), & (t,x) \\in (0,\\infty) \\times \\mathbb{R} \\\\\nv(0,x) = 0 \\\\\n\\partial_{t}v(0,x) = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe solution to this problem is given by Duhamel's principle as the spacetime convolution of the fundamental solution $G$ with the source term $f$:\n$$\nv(t,x) = (G * f)(t,x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} G(t-s, x-y) f(s,y) \\, ds \\, dy\n$$\nOn the other hand, the explicit solution to this initial value problem is given by d'Alembert's formula for the inhomogeneous equation:\n$$\nv(t,x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{x-(t-s)}^{x+(t-s)} f(s,y) \\, dy \\, ds\n$$\nWe can rewrite this formula as an integral over all of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ by introducing an indicator function for the domain of integration:\n$$\nv(t,x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{1}_{\\{0 \\le s \\le t, |x-y| \\le t-s\\}} f(s,y) \\, dy \\, ds\n$$\nComparing this with the convolution formula, we identify the kernel $G$.

The lower limit at $t=0$ yields:\n$$\n\\langle L G, \\varphi \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2} [0 - (\\varphi(0,0) + \\varphi(0,0))] = \\varphi(0,0)\n$$\nThis confirms that $G(t,x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{1}_{\\{t \\ge 0, |x| \\le t\\}}$ is indeed the correct forward fundamental solution.\n\n### Part 2: Stochastic Convolution Term\n\nThe given SPDE is $\\partial_{t}^{2}u - \\partial_{x}^{2}u = \\dot{M}(t,x)$ with zero initial conditions. The solution to an inhomogeneous linear PDE with zero initial data can be formally expressed as the convolution of the fundamental solution with the source term. In the context of SPDEs driven by a martingale measure $M$, this convolution becomes a stochastic integral. The mild solution $u(t,x)$ is therefore given by:\n$$\nu(t,x) = \\int_0^T \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} G(t-s, x-y) M(ds, dy)\n$$\nwhere $G$ is the fundamental solution derived in Part 1. This integral is the stochastic convolution term.

So, the differential of the kinetic energy is:\n$$\ndE_{k}(t) = \\langle v(t), c^{2}\\Delta u(t) dt + \\sigma dW(t) \\rangle_{H} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}\\operatorname{Tr}(Q) dt\n$$\n$$\ndE_{k}(t) = c^{2}\\langle v(t), \\Delta u(t) \\rangle_{H} dt + \\sigma\\langle v(t), dW(t) \\rangle_{H} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}\\operatorname{Tr}(Q) dt\n$$\n\nNext, consider the potential energy term $E_{p}(t) = \\frac{c^{2}}{2}\\|\\nabla u(t)\\|_{H}^{2} = \\frac{c^{2}}{2}\\langle \\nabla u(t), \\nabla u(t) \\rangle_{H}$. The process $u(t)$ has a differential $du(t) = v(t) dt$, which has no martingale part. Therefore, the classical chain rule applies (or ItÃ´'s formula with a zero quadratic variation term):\n$$\ndE_{p}(t) = \\frac{c^{2}}{2} d\\langle \\nabla u(t), \\nabla u(t) \\rangle_{H} = c^{2}\\langle \\nabla u(t), d(\\nabla u(t)) \\rangle_{H}\n$$\nSince $d(\\nabla u(t)) = \\nabla(du(t)) = \\nabla(v(t) dt) = (\\nabla v(t)) dt$, we have:\n$$\ndE_{p}(t) = c^{2}\\langle \\nabla u(t), \\nabla v(t) \\rangle_{H} dt\n$$\n\nNow, we sum the differentials $dE_{k}(t)$ and $dE_{p}(t)$ to obtain $dE(t)$:\n$$\ndE(t) = \\left( c^{2}\\langle v(t), \\Delta u(t) \\rangle_{H} + c^{2}\\langle \\nabla u(t), \\nabla v(t) \\rangle_{H} \\right) dt + \\sigma\\langle v(t), dW(t) \\rangle_{H} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}\\operatorname{Tr}(Q) dt\n$$\nLet's analyze the first term in the drift, which combines the effects of the wave propagation. We use inner product notation for integrals over $D$:\n$$\nc^{2}\\langle v, \\Delta u \\rangle_{H} + c^{2}\\langle \\nabla u, \\nabla v \\rangle_{H} = c^{2}\\int_{D} v(t,x) \\Delta u(t,x) dx + c^{2}\\int_{D} \\nabla u(t,x) \\cdot \\nabla v(t,x) dx\n$$\nWe apply Green's first identity to the term $\\int_{D} v \\Delta u \\, dx$:\n$$\n\\int_{D} v \\Delta u \\, dx = \\int_{\\partial D} v \\, \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\nu} \\, dS - \\int_{D} \\nabla v \\cdot \\nabla u \\, dx\n$$\nHere, $\\partial_{\\nu}u = \\nabla u \\cdot \\nu$ is the normal derivative on the boundary $\\partial D$. Substituting this back into the expression for the drift gives:\n$$\nc^{2} \\left( \\int_{\\partial D} v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\nu} dS - \\int_{D} \\nabla v \\cdot \\nabla u dx + \\int_{D} \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v dx \\right) = c^{2} \\int_{\\partial D} v(t,x) \\frac{\\partial u(t,x)}{\\partial \\nu} dS\n$$\nThe two inner product terms involving gradients cancel out. Substituting $v = \\partial_t u$, we identify this as the boundary energy flux term.\n\nThe complete energy balance equation is therefore:\n$$\ndE(t) = \\underbrace{c^{2}\\left(\\int_{\\partial D} \\partial_{t}u(t,x) \\, \\partial_{\\nu}u(t,x) \\, dS(x)\\right) dt}_{\\text{Boundary Flux Term}} + \\underbrace{\\sigma\\langle \\partial_{t}u(t, \\cdot), dW(t) \\rangle_{H}}_{\\text{Stochastic Term}} + \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}\\operatorname{Tr}(Q) dt}_{\\text{ItÃ´ Correction}}\n$$\nThis equation describes the evolution of the total energy $E(t)$. The change in energy is driven by three components:\n1.  The energy flux across the boundary $\\partial D$.\n2.  A martingale term representing random energy exchange with the noise field.\n3.  A deterministic drift term arising from the stochastic forcing, which systematically increases the system's energy.\n\nThe problem asks to identify the boundary energy flux term and compute it under the homogeneous Neumann boundary condition $\\partial_{\\nu}u(t,x) = 0$ for $x \\in \\partial D$. The boundary energy flux term appearing in the differential $dE(t)$ is:\n$$\nc^{2} \\int_{\\partial D} \\partial_{t}u(t,x) \\, \\partial_{\\nu}u(t,x) \\, dS(x)\n$$\nApplying the Neumann condition $\\partial_{\\nu}u = 0$, this term becomes:\n$$\nc^{2} \\int_{\\partial D} \\partial_{t}u(t,x) \\cdot (0) \\, dS(x) = 0\n$$\nThus, under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, there is no energy flux across the boundary. The boundary does not contribute to the change in energy, which is consistent with its physical interpretation as a perfectly reflecting or insulated boundary.\n\nFinally, we address whether total energy is conserved. With zero boundary flux, the energy balance simplifies to:\n$$\ndE(t) = \\sigma\\langle \\partial_{t}u, dW(t) \\rangle_{H} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}\\operatorname{Tr}(Q) dt\n$$\nSince $E(t)$ is a stochastic process and not constant, the energy is not conserved pathwise. Taking the expectation, and assuming the stochastic integral is a true martingale with zero expectation, we find the evolution of the expected energy:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\mathbb{E}[E(t)] = \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}\\operatorname{Tr}(Q)\n$$\nSince $\\sigma > 0$ and $Q$ is a non-negative operator for a non-trivial process (so $\\operatorname{Tr}(Q) > 0$), we have $\\frac{d}{dt}\\mathbb{E}[E(t)] > 0$. The expected energy of the system strictly increases over time. This continuous injection of energy is a fundamental feature of systems driven by additive stochastic noise. Therefore, total energy is not conserved.\n\nThe final answer requested is the explicit analytic expression for the boundary energy flux term under the Neumann condition.
