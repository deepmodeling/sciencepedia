The deterministic term $S(t)X_0$ is well-defined for any $X_0 \\in H$ because $S(t)$ is a strongly continuous semigroup.\n2. The stochastic term, known as the stochastic convolution, is $W_\\Delta(t) := \\int_{0}^{t} S(t-s)\\,\\mathrm{d}W^{Q}(s)$. Its existence as an $H$-valued random variable in $L^2(\\Omega; H)$ is guaranteed if the operator-valued function $s \\mapsto S(s)$ satisfies the condition $\\int_0^t \\mathbb{E} \\| S(s) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}W^Q}{\\mathrm{d}s} \\|_H^2 \\mathrm{d}s  \\infty$. Using the Itô isometry for stochastic integrals in Hilbert spaces, this condition translates to requiring the finiteness of the integral of the trace:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E} \\left\\| \\int_{0}^{t} S(t-s)\\,\\mathrm{d}W^{Q}(s) \\right\\|_{H}^{2} = \\int_{0}^{t} \\mathrm{Tr}\\left( S(t-s) Q S(t-s)^{\\ast} \\right) \\mathrm{d}s\n$$\nThe operator $\\Delta$ is self-adjoint, which implies its generated semigroup $S(t)$ is also self-adjoint, i.e., $S(t)^{\\ast} = S(t)$. The Dirichlet Laplacian on a bounded domain generates an exponentially stable semigroup, meaning there exists a constant $\\lambda_1 > 0$ (the smallest eigenvalue of $-\\Delta$) such that $\\|S(t)\\|_{\\mathcal{L}(H)} \\le \\exp(-\\lambda_1 t)$ for $t \\ge 0$.

Uniqueness of the mild solution for this linear equation is a standard result; if two solutions existed, their difference would satisfy the homogeneous deterministic equation with zero initial data, and must thus be identically zero.\n\nNext, we argue that this mild solution is also a variational solution. A variational solution is a process with values in $V=H_0^1(D)$ that satisfies the weak formulation of the SPDE. The space $V$ is characterized as the domain of the operator $(-\\Delta)^{1/2}$, so $V=D((-\\Delta)^{1/2})$. We must show that $X(t)$ takes values in $V$ almost surely for $t > 0$.\n1. For the deterministic part, $S(t)X_0$: Since $S(t)$ is an analytic semigroup, it has a smoothing property. For any $X_0 \\in H$ and $t > 0$, the element $S(t)X_0$ belongs to the domain of the generator, $D(\\Delta) = H^2(D) \\cap H_0^1(D)$, which is a subset of $V=H_0^1(D)$.\n2. For the stochastic part, $W_\\Delta(t)$: We need to show that it is $V$-valued, which we can verify by checking if $\\mathbb{E}\\|(-\\Delta)^{1/2} W_\\Delta(t)\\|_H^2  \\infty$.

Furthermore, $Q$ commutes with $\\Delta$, so it also commutes with $(-\\Delta)^{1/2}$ and $S(t-s)$. The integrand becomes:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Tr}\\left( S(t-s) (-\\Delta)^{1/2} Q (-\\Delta)^{1/2} S(t-s) \\right) = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left( S(2(t-s)) (-\\Delta) Q \\right)\n$$\nLet $\\{e_k\\}_{k=1}^\\infty$ be an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of $-\\Delta$ with eigenvalues $0  \\lambda_1 \\le \\lambda_2 \\le \\dots$. As $Q$ commutes with $\\Delta$, this basis can also be chosen to diagonalize $Q$, with corresponding non-negative eigenvalues $q_k$. Then $\\mathrm{Tr}(Q) = \\sum_k q_k  \\infty$. The trace becomes:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Tr}(S(2u) (-\\Delta) Q) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\langle S(2u)(-\\Delta)Q e_k, e_k \\rangle_H = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty q_k \\lambda_k \\exp(-2u\\lambda_k)\n$$\nIntegrating this from $u=0$ to $u=t$ and using the Fubini-Tonelli theorem:\n$$\n\\int_0^t \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty q_k \\lambda_k \\exp(-2u\\lambda_k) \\mathrm{d}u = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty q_k \\lambda_k \\int_0^t \\exp(-2u\\lambda_k) \\mathrm{d}u = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty q_k \\lambda_k \\left[ \\frac{1-\\exp(-2t\\lambda_k)}{2\\lambda_k} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty q_k(1-\\exp(-2t\\lambda_k))\n$$\nThis sum is bounded above by $\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty q_k = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{Tr}(Q)  \\infty$.\nThus, the stochastic convolution is in $L^2(\\Omega, V)$. Since both terms of the mild solution are in $V$ for $t > 0$, the solution $X(t)$ is almost surely in $V = H_0^1(D)$ and can be shown to satisfy the variational formulation of the SPDE, which makes it a variational solution.\n\n\\subsection*{Part 2: Stationary Solution}\nA stationary solution can be constructed by extending the integration interval to $(-\\infty, t]$:\n$$\nX_{\\mathrm{stat}}(t) := \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} S(t-s)\\,\\mathrm{d}W^{Q}(s)\n$$\nThis is an improper stochastic integral, defined as an $L^2(\\Omega; H)$ limit of $\\int_{-T}^t S(t-s)\\,\\mathrm{d}W^Q(s)$ as $T \\to \\infty$.

This proves that the improper stochastic integral is well-defined in $L^2(\\Omega; H)$. The resulting process $X_{\\mathrm{stat}}(t)$ is stationary because the Wiener process has stationary increments and the convolution kernel $S(t-s)$ is a function of the time difference.\n\n\\subsection*{Part 3: Covariance Operator of the Stationary Solution}\nThe stationary solution $X_{\\mathrm{stat}}(t)$ is a centered Gaussian process, so its law is determined by its covariance operator $\\Sigma$, defined by $\\langle \\Sigma x, y \\rangle_H = \\mathbb{E}[\\langle X_{\\mathrm{stat}}(t), x \\rangle_H \\langle X_{\\mathrm{stat}}(t), y \\rangle_H]$ for $x,y \\in H$.\nStationarity implies that $\\Sigma$ is constant in time. We can derive an operator equation for $\\Sigma$ by considering the time evolution of the second moments. Using Itô's product rule on $\\langle X(t), x \\rangle_H \\langle X(t), y \\rangle_H$ for sufficiently regular $x, y$ (e.g., in $D(\\Delta)$) and taking expectations, the martingale terms vanish:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\mathbb{E}[\\langle X(t),x \\rangle_H \\langle X(t),y \\rangle_H] = \\mathbb{E}[\\langle \\Delta X(t),x \\rangle_H \\langle X(t),y \\rangle_H + \\langle X(t),x \\rangle_H \\langle \\Delta X(t),y \\rangle_H] + \\langle Qx,y \\rangle_H\n$$\nIn terms of $\\Sigma$, this is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\langle \\Sigma x,y \\rangle_H = \\langle \\Sigma \\Delta x,y \\rangle_H + \\langle \\Sigma x,\\Delta y \\rangle_H + \\langle Qx,y \\rangle_H = \\langle (\\Delta\\Sigma + \\Sigma\\Delta)x, y \\rangle_H + \\langle Qx,y \\rangle_H\n$$\nSince the process is stationary, the left hand side is zero. This yields the continuous-time algebraic Lyapunov equation for $\\Sigma$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Sigma + \\Sigma\\Delta + Q = 0\n$$\nTo solve for $\\Sigma$ explicitly, we use its integral representation derived from the definition of $X_{\\mathrm{stat}}(t)$:\n$$\n\\Sigma = \\int_0^\\infty S(u)QS(u)^{\\ast} \\mathrm{d}u\n$$\nGiven that $\\Delta$ is self-adjoint ($S(u)^{\\ast}=S(u)$) and that $Q$ commutes with $\\Delta$ (and thus with $S(u)$), we can simplify the integrand:\n$$\nS(u)QS(u) = Q S(u)S(u) = Q S(2u) = Q\\exp(2u\\Delta)\n$$\nThe expression for $\\Sigma$ becomes:\n$$\n\\Sigma = \\int_0^\\infty Q \\exp(2u\\Delta) \\mathrm{d}u = Q \\int_0^\\infty \\exp(2u\\Delta) \\mathrm{d}u\n$$\nThe integral of an exponentially stable semigroup is the negative of the inverse of its generator.

The problem asks to identify correct statements regarding the proof of pathwise uniqueness for solutions to such equations, focusing on the role of localization via stopping times.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **SPDE:** $\\mathrm{d}X(t) = A X(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t + F(X(t))\\,\\mathrm{d}t + G(X(t))\\,\\mathrm{d}W(t)$ for $t \\in [0,T]$.\n- **Hilbert Spaces:** $H$ and $U$ are separable Hilbert spaces.\n- **Linear Operator:** $A$ is the generator of a strongly continuous ($C_0$) semigroup $\\{S(t)\\}_{t\\ge 0}$ on $H$.\n- **Noise:** $W$ is a cylindrical Wiener process on $U$, defined on a filtered probability space $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},\\{\\mathcal{F}_t\\}_{t\\ge 0},\\mathbb{P})$.\n- **Nonlinear Coefficients:** $F\\colon H \\to H$ and $G\\colon H \\to \\mathcal{L}_2(U,H)$, where $\\mathcal{L}_2(U,H)$ is the space of Hilbert–Schmidt operators.\n- **Local Lipschitz Condition:** For each $R>0$, there exists a constant $L_R>0$ such that for all $x,y\\in H$ with $\\|x\\|_H\\vee \\|y\\|_H \\le R$, the following inequalities hold:\n$$\n\\|F(x)-F(y)\\|_H \\le L_R \\|x-y\\|_H,\n$$\n$$\n\\|G(x)-G(y)\\|_{\\mathcal{L}_2(U,H)} \\le L_R \\|x-y\\|_H.\n$$\n- **Linear Growth Condition:** There exists a constant $C>0$ such that for all $x\\in H$:\n$$\n\\|F(x)\\|_H + \\|G(x)\\|_{\\mathcal{L}_2(U,H)} \\le C(1+\\|x\\|_H).\n$$\n- **Solutions  Initial Condition:** $X$ and $Y$ are two mild solutions with the same initial condition $X(0)=Y(0)$, adapted to the same filtration and driven by the same Wiener process $W$.\n- **Stopping Time:** For $R>0$, the stopping time $\\tau_R$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\tau_R := \\inf\\{t\\in[0,T]: \\|X(t)\\|_H \\vee \\|Y(t)\\|_H \\ge R\\} \\wedge T.\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard framework for studying semilinear SPDEs, consistent with established literature (e.g., Da Prato  Zabczyk, \"Stochastic Equations in Infinite Dimensions\"). The assumptions on the coefficients ($F$, $G$) and the operator $A$ are typical for proving existence and uniqueness of mild solutions. The question itself pertains to a fundamental proof technique—localization—used to handle non-global properties like the local Lipschitz condition. The setup is complete and internally consistent. No flaws are identified.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. Proceeding to solution and option analysis.\n\n### Core Derivation\nLet $X(t)$ and $Y(t)$ be two mild solutions. By definition, they satisfy the integral equations:\n$$\nX(t) = S(t)X(0) + \\int_0^t S(t-s)F(X(s))\\,\\mathrm{d}s + \\int_0^t S(t-s)G(X(s))\\,\\mathrm{d}W(s)\n$$\n$$\nY(t) = S(t)Y(0) + \\int_0^t S(t-s)F(Y(s))\\,\\mathrm{d}s + \\int_0^t S(t-s)G(Y(s))\\,\\mathrm{d}W(s)\n$$\nLet $Z(t) = X(t) - Y(t)$. Since $X(0)=Y(0)$, we have $Z(0)=0$. Subtracting the two equations gives:\n$$\nZ(t) = \\int_0^t S(t-s)[F(X(s)) - F(Y(s))]\\,\\mathrm{d}s + \\int_0^t S(t-s)[G(X(s)) - G(Y(s))]\\,\\mathrm{d}W(s)\n$$\nTo prove uniqueness, we must show that $Z(t) = 0$ for all $t\\in[0,T]$ almost surely. The main difficulty is that the Lipschitz condition on $F$ and $G$ is only local. We cannot assume a global Lipschitz constant. This is where the stopping time $\\tau_R$ is essential.\n\nFor any time $t \\le \\tau_R$, we know by definition of $\\tau_R$ that $\\|X(s)\\|_H  R$ and $\\|Y(s)\\|_H  R$ for all $s  t$. By continuity of paths, we can say $\\|X(s)\\|_H \\le R$ and $\\|Y(s)\\|_H \\le R$ for $s \\le t \\wedge \\tau_R$. On the interval $[0, \\tau_R]$, the local Lipschitz condition becomes effective with the constant $L_R$.\n\nLet $t_R = t \\wedge \\tau_R$. We have for $s \\in [0, t_R]$:\n$$\n\\|F(X(s)) - F(Y(s))\\|_H \\le L_R \\|Z(s)\\|_H\n$$\n$$\n\\|G(X(s)) - G(Y(s))\\|_{\\mathcal{L}_2(U,H)} \\le L_R \\|Z(s)\\|_H\n$$\nWe can now estimate $\\mathbb{E}[\\sup_{s \\in [0, t_R]} \\|Z(s)\\|_H^2]$. Let $M = \\sup_{s\\in[0,T]}\\|S(s)\\|_{\\mathcal{L}(H,H)}  \\infty$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sup_{u \\in [0, t_R]} \\|Z(u)\\|_H^2\\right] \\le 2\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sup_{u \\in [0, t_R]} \\left\\|\\int_0^u S(u-s)[F(X(s)) - F(Y(s))]\\,\\mathrm{d}s\\right\\|_H^2\\right] \\\\\n+ 2\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sup_{u \\in [0, t_R]} \\left\\|\\int_0^u S(u-s)[G(X(s)) - G(Y(s))]\\,\\mathrm{d}W(s)\\right\\|_H^2\\right]\n$$\nUsing standard estimates for deterministic and stochastic convolutions (the latter involving the Burkholder-Davis-Gundy inequality), both terms on the right-hand side can be bounded by an expression of the form $C_{R,T} \\int_0^{t_R} \\mathbb{E}[\\|Z(s)\\|_H^2]\\,\\mathrm{d}s$.\nLetting $\\phi(t) = \\mathbb{E}[\\sup_{u \\in [0, t \\wedge \\tau_R]} \\|Z(u)\\|_H^2]$, we arrive at an integral inequality:\n$$\n\\phi(t) \\le K_{R,T} \\int_0^t \\mathbb{E}[\\|Z(s \\wedge \\tau_R)\\|_H^2]\\,\\mathrm{d}s \\le K_{R,T} \\int_0^t \\phi(s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s\n$$\nSince $\\phi(0) = \\mathbb{E}[\\|Z(0)\\|_H^2] = 0$, the deterministic Gronwall lemma implies $\\phi(t)=0$ for all $t\\in[0,T]$. This means $\\mathbb{E}[\\sup_{u \\in [0, \\tau_R]} \\|Z(u)\\|_H^2] = 0$, which implies $X(t)=Y(t)$ for all $t \\in [0,\\tau_R]$ almost surely.\n\nThe final step is to extend this local uniqueness to a global one. The linear growth condition on $F$ and $G$ ensures that the solution does not explode in finite time. This means that $\\lim_{R\\to\\infty} \\tau_R = T$ almost surely. Since $X=Y$ on $[0, \\tau_R]$ for every $R>0$, it follows that $X=Y$ on $[0,T]$ almost surely. This establishes pathwise uniqueness.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. On the localized interval $[0,\\tau_R]$ the local Lipschitz bounds for $F$ and $G$ become effective, allowing estimates of the difference $Z(t):=X(t)-Y(t)$ in the mild formulation. After bounding the stochastic convolution via the Burkholder–Davis–Gundy inequality and taking expectations of $\\sup_{t\\le T\\wedge \\tau_R}\\|Z(t)\\|_H^2$, one obtains an integral inequality to which a deterministic Gronwall lemma applies, yielding $X=Y$ on $[0,\\tau_R]$ almost surely. Sending $R\\to\\infty$ then gives global pathwise uniqueness on $[0,T]$.**\nThis statement accurately summarizes the entire proof strategy for pathwise uniqueness of mild solutions under local Lipschitz conditions. Each step described—localization via $\\tau_R$, application of local Lipschitz bounds, use of estimates for the stochastic convolution based on BDG, taking expectations of the supremum of the norm, application of Gronwall's lemma, and the final limit $R\\to\\infty$—is a correct and standard part of the argument.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Stopping times are unnecessary in the mild framework because the smoothing property of the strongly continuous semigroup $\\{S(t)\\}_{t\\ge 0}$ forces the nonlinearities $F$ and $G$ to be globally Lipschitz, so a Gronwall inequality can be applied directly on $[0,T]$ without localization.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The semigroup $S(t)$ acts on the state $X(t)$, not on the functions $F$ and $G$ themselves. The property of being locally or globally Lipschitz is an intrinsic property of the maps $F$ and $G$. A general $C_0$-semigroup does not possess a \"smoothing property\" that would alter this. If $F$ and $G$ were globally Lipschitz to begin with, stopping times would indeed be unnecessary for the uniqueness proof, but the problem specifies they are locally Lipschitz, and the semigroup does not change this fact.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Localization via the stopping time $\\tau_R$ permits replacing stochastic integrals by pathwise Riemann integrals on $[0,\\tau_R]$, which removes the need for martingale estimates and allows a direct application of a deterministic Gronwall inequality.**\nThis statement demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of stochastic integration. The integral with respect to a Wiener process $W(t)$ is an Itô integral because the paths of $W(t)$ have unbounded variation. Localization via a stopping time does not alter the nature of the integrator. The integral remains a stochastic one, and martingale-related properties and estimates (like the Itô isometry or the Burkholder-Davis-Gundy inequality) are essential for controlling its moments.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The primary role of stopping times in this setting is to force the stochastic convolution term to vanish on $[0,\\tau_R]$ by the optional sampling theorem, hence uniqueness follows immediately without additional estimates.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The optional sampling theorem relates the expected value of a stopped martingale to its initial expected value, i.e., $\\mathbb{E}[M_\\tau] = \\mathbb{E}[M_0]$ under certain conditions. It does not imply that the process itself vanishes. Furthermore, the stochastic convolution term is not, in general, a martingale. Localization does not cause any term to vanish; it serves to make the local Lipschitz condition applicable for estimates.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. In the variational setting under local monotonicity and coercivity conditions, localization by a sequence of stopping times $(\\tau_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ defined by bounds on $\\|X\\|_H$ and $\\|Y\\|_H$ enables applying the Itô formula to $\\|X(t)-Y(t)\\|_H^2$ up to $\\tau_n$ to derive an energy inequality. After taking expectations and using a Gronwall-type argument, one concludes $X=Y$ on $[0,\\tau_n]$ almost surely, and then lets $n\\to\\infty$ to obtain global pathwise uniqueness on $[0,T]$.**\nThis statement describes the proof of pathwise uniqueness in the variational framework for SPDEs, which is distinct from the mild solution framework but conceptually parallel. In this setting, local monotonicity and coercivity replace the local Lipschitz condition. The core technique, however, is the same: localization via stopping times ($\\tau_n$) to make local conditions applicable. The tool used is Itô's formula for $\\|X(t)-Y(t)\\|_H^2$ instead of the mild solution integral formula. Taking expectations of the resulting \"energy inequality\" and applying Gronwall's lemma leads to local uniqueness, which is then extended globally. The statement is a correct description of this important, analogous procedure. The question asks about the role of stopping times and localization in general, and this option provides a correct explanation in a closely related, fundamental context. Therefore, it is a valid answer.\n**Verdict: Correct**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "2987689"}]}
