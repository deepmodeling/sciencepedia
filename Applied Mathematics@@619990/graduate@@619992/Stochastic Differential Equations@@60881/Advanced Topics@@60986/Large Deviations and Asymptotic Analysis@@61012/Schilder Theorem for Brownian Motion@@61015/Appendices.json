This involves solving two separate variational problems. The quantity $\\inf_{\\phi \\in A} I(\\phi)$ is often denoted as $I(A)$.\n\n### Variational Problem for the Set $A_1$\n\nThe set $A_1$ is defined as $A_{1}=\\{\\phi\\in C([0,T]): \\phi(0)=\\phi(T)=0,\\ \\text{and there exists }t_{1}\\in(0,T)\\text{ with }\\phi(t_{1})=a\\}$. To minimize the \"energy\" functional $I(\\phi)$, the path will not go higher than required. Thus, we seek the minimum of $I(\\phi)$ subject to the constraints $\\phi(0)=0$, $\\phi(T)=0$, and $\\phi(t_1)=a$ for some $t_1 \\in (0,T)$.\n\nThe Euler-Lagrange equation for the functional $J(\\phi) = \\int_0^T \\dot{\\phi}(t)^2 dt$ is $\\ddot{\\phi}(t) = 0$. This implies that the energy-minimizing path between any two fixed points is a straight line. Therefore, the optimal path for $A_1$ will be piecewise linear, consisting of a line segment from $(0,0)$ to $(t_1, a)$ followed by a line segment from $(t_1, a)$ to $(T,0)$.\n\nFor a given time $t_1 \\in (0,T)$, the path is:\n$$ \\phi(t) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{a}{t_1} t & \\text{for } 0 \\le t \\le t_1 \\\\ a - \\frac{a}{T-t_1}(t-t_1) & \\text{for } t_1 < t \\le T \\end{cases} $$\nThe corresponding derivatives are $\\dot{\\phi}(t) = a/t_1$ on $[0, t_1)$ and $\\dot{\\phi}(t) = -a/(T-t_1)$ on $(t_1, T]$. The rate function for this specific path, parametrized by $t_1$, is:\n$$ I(\\phi; t_1) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^{t_1} \\left(\\frac{a}{t_1}\\right)^2 dt + \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{t_1}^T \\left(\\frac{-a}{T-t_1}\\right)^2 dt $$\n$$ I(\\phi; t_1) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{a^2}{t_1^2} \\cdot t_1 + \\frac{a^2}{(T-t_1)^2} \\cdot (T-t_1) \\right] = \\frac{a^2}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{t_1} + \\frac{1}{T-t_1} \\right) $$\nTo find the overall minimum $I(A_1)$, we must minimize this expression with respect to $t_1 \\in (0,T)$. We compute the derivative and set it to zero:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt_1} \\left( \\frac{1}{t_1} + \\frac{1}{T-t_1} \\right) = -\\frac{1}{t_1^2} + \\frac{1}{(T-t_1)^2} = 0 $$\nThis implies $t_1^2 = (T-t_1)^2$, which for $t_1 \\in (0,T)$ yields $t_1 = T-t_1$, so $t_1 = T/2$.\nSubstituting this optimal time back into the energy expression gives the minimal rate for $A_1$:\n$$ I(A_1) = \\frac{a^2}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{T/2} + \\frac{1}{T - T/2} \\right) = \\frac{a^2}{2} \\left( \\frac{2}{T} + \\frac{2}{T} \\right) = \\frac{2a^2}{T} $$\nThus, $\\lim_{\\varepsilon\\to 0} \\varepsilon\\log \\mathbb{P}(X^{\\varepsilon}\\in A_{1}) = -I(A_1) = -\\frac{2a^2}{T}$.

The energy of a linear path segment from $(t_i, y_i)$ to $(t_f, y_f)$ is $\\frac{(y_f-y_i)^2}{2(t_f-t_i)}$.\nFor a path with intermediate times $t_1, t_2, t_3$, the total energy is:\n$$ I(\\phi; t_1, t_2, t_3) = \\frac{(a-0)^2}{2(t_1-0)} + \\frac{(0-a)^2}{2(t_2-t_1)} + \\frac{(a-0)^2}{2(t_3-t_2)} + \\frac{(0-a)^2}{2(T-t_3)} $$\n$$ I(\\phi; t_1, t_2, t_3) = \\frac{a^2}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{t_1} + \\frac{1}{t_2-t_1} + \\frac{1}{t_3-t_2} + \\frac{1}{T-t_3} \\right) $$\nTo find the infimum, we must minimize this over all valid times $0 < t_1 < t_2 < t_3 < T$. Let $\\Delta t_1 = t_1$, $\\Delta t_2 = t_2-t_1$, $\\Delta t_3 = t_3-t_2$, and $\\Delta t_4 = T-t_3$. We must minimize $\\sum_{i=1}^4 \\frac{1}{\\Delta t_i}$ subject to the constraint $\\sum_{i=1}^4 \\Delta t_i = T$.\nBy the method of Lagrange multipliers or the arithmetic mean-harmonic mean inequality, the sum is minimized when all terms $\\Delta t_i$ are equal. Therefore, $\\Delta t_i = T/4$ for $i=1,2,3,4$.\nThe minimum value of the sum is $\\frac{1}{T/4} + \\frac{1}{T/4} + \\frac{1}{T/4} + \\frac{1}{T/4} = \\frac{16}{T}$.\nSubstituting this into the energy expression gives the minimal rate for $A_3$:\n$$ I(A_3) = \\frac{a^2}{2} \\left( \\frac{16}{T} \\right) = \\frac{8a^2}{T} $$\nThus, $\\lim_{\\varepsilon\\to 0} \\varepsilon\\log \\mathbb{P}(X^{\\varepsilon}\\in A_{3}) = -I(A_3) = -\\frac{8a^2}{T}$. This implies the asymptotic behavior:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(X^{\\varepsilon}\\in A_{3}) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{8a^2}{\\varepsilon T} + o\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\right) $$\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\nWe have found the large deviation rates to be $I(A_1) = \\frac{2a^2}{T}$ and $I(A_3) = \\frac{8a^2}{T}$. We observe that $I(A_3) = 4 \\cdot I(A_1)$. Now we evaluate each option.\n\n**A.** The option states that $\\mathbb{P}(X^{\\varepsilon}\\in A_{1})=\\exp\\!\\big(-\\tfrac{2a^{2}}{\\varepsilon T}+o(\\tfrac{1}{\\varepsilon})\\big)$ and $\\mathbb{P}(X^{\\varepsilon}\\in A_{3})=\\exp\\!\\big(-\\tfrac{8a^{2}}{\\varepsilon T}+o(\\tfrac{1}{\\varepsilon})\\big)$. These expressions are precisely what we derived. The option further provides a reason: \"The large deviation rate is proportional to the square of the total variation of the excursion, so doubling the number of up–down legs from $2$ to $4$ quadruples the cost.\"\nLet's analyze this reasoning. The optimal path for $A_1$ consists of 2 \"legs\" (up, down), traversing a total vertical distance (total variation) of $V_1=a+a=2a$. The optimal path for $A_3$ consists of 4 \"legs\" (up, down, up, down), with total variation $V_3=a+a+a+a=4a$.\nThe rates are $I(A_1) = \\frac{2a^2}{T} = \\frac{(2a)^2}{2T} = \\frac{V_1^2}{2T}$ and $I(A_3) = \\frac{8a^2}{T} = \\frac{16a^2}{2T} = \\frac{(4a)^2}{2T} = \\frac{V_3^2}{2T}$.\nSo the rate is indeed proportional to the square of the total variation. Doubling the number of legs from $2$ to $4$ doubles the total variation (from $2a$ to $4a$), which in turn quadruples the rate (since $I \\propto V^2$). The cost (rate) increases from $\\frac{2a^2}{T}$ to $\\frac{8a^2}{T}$, which is a factor of $4$. The reasoning is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.** This option claims the rates are $\\frac{a^2}{2T}$ for $A_1$ and $\\frac{a^2}{T}$ for $A_3$. These values are incorrect by a factor of $4$. The conclusion that the cost is doubled is also incorrect; it is quadrupled.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** This option claims that the events have the same large deviation exponential order, meaning $I(A_1) = I(A_3)$. Our calculation shows $I(A_1) = \\frac{2a^2}{T}$ and $I(A_3) = \\frac{8a^2}{T}$, which are unequal for $a>0$. The reasoning given for this false claim is also flawed; adding path constraints like additional oscillations fundamentally changes the variational problem and typically increases the minimal energy, affecting the exponential rate, not just sub-exponential prefactors.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.** This option claims that the costs for $A_1$ and $A_3$ are equal, based on the faulty reasoning that a path can \"reduce its cost by pausing at the level $a$\". Let's consider a path that moves from $(0,0)$ to $(t_a, a)$, waits until time $t_b$, then moves from $(t_b, a)$ to $(T,0)$. The energy is $\\frac{a^2}{2t_a} + \\frac{a^2}{2(T-t_b)}$. The total time spent moving is $T' = t_a + (T-t_b) < T$. The minimum energy for a given moving time $T'$ is $\\frac{2a^2}{T'}$. Since $T' < T$, this energy is strictly greater than $\\frac{2a^2}{T}$, the energy of the path that does not pause. Therefore, pausing for a macroscopic time *increases* the energy cost, invalidating the premise of this option.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the rigorous derivation from first principles as requested, only option A provides both the correct mathematical expressions for the probabilities and a correct explanation for the relationship between them. The increased number of oscillations is penalized by forcing the path to have steeper slopes, which leads to a quadratically larger energy cost.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2995048"}, {"introduction": "The rate function of Schilder’s theorem sharply divides paths into those with finite cost and those with infinite cost, a distinction captured by the structure of the Cameron-Martin space.

As $\\delta \\downarrow 0$, the constraint becomes tighter, forcing any finite-energy path to more closely resemble the infinite-energy path $\\varphi$. This suggests that the cost $I_\\delta$ must increase as $\\delta \\downarrow 0$. The rate of this divergence is a known result in large deviation theory.\n\n*   **Subcase 2a: $\\alpha < \\frac{1}{2}$**\n    The path $\\varphi(t) = ct^\\alpha$ is more \"cuspy\" than any path in $H_0^1([0,T])$. Paths in $H_0^1$ cannot grow faster than $O(\\sqrt{t})$ near $t=0$. The task is to find a path $\\psi \\in H_0^1$ that minimizes the energy subject to $\\|\\psi-\\varphi\\|_\\infty \\le \\delta$. A detailed variational analysis shows that the minimal energy required to satisfy this constraint scales with $\\delta$. The scaling law is found by balancing the growth of the target path with the growth constraints on finite-energy paths. The result is that the infimum energy behaves as:\n    $$ \\inf_{\\psi\\in B_\\delta(\\varphi)}I(\\psi) \\sim K \\cdot \\delta^{-(1-2\\alpha)/\\alpha} \\quad \\text{as } \\delta \\downarrow 0 $$\n    for some positive constant $K$. Since $0 < \\alpha < 1/2$, the exponent $(1-2\\alpha)/\\alpha$ is positive, meaning the energy diverges to $+\\infty$ as $\\delta \\downarrow 0$.\n\n*   **Subcase 2b: $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$**\n    This is a critical case. The target path is $\\varphi(t) = c\\sqrt{t}$. Again, $I(\\varphi) = +\\infty$. We can construct a family of approximating paths in $H_0^1$, for example by regularizing $\\varphi$ near the origin, like $\\psi_\\eta(t) = c\\sqrt{t+\\eta}-c\\sqrt{\\eta}$. The energy of such a path is $I(\\psi_\\eta) \\sim C_1 \\log(1/\\eta)$. The distance to $\\varphi$ is $\\|\\psi_\\eta-\\varphi\\|_\\infty \\sim C_2 \\sqrt{\\eta}$. Setting this distance to $\\delta$, we have $\\eta \\sim ( \\delta/C_2 )^2$. Substituting this into the energy expression gives:\n    $$ \\inf_{\\psi\\in B_\\delta(\\varphi)}I(\\psi) \\sim C_1 \\log(1/(\\delta/C_2)^2) = 2C_1 \\log(C_2/\\delta) \\sim K \\cdot \\log(1/\\delta) \\quad \\text{as } \\delta \\downarrow 0 $$\n    The cost diverges logarithmically, which is slower than the power-law divergence for $\\alpha < 1/2$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For $\\alpha>\\tfrac{1}{2}$, the quantity $\\inf_{\\psi\\in B_\\delta(\\varphi)}I(\\psi)$ is finite and converges to $I(\\varphi)$ as $\\delta\\downarrow 0$. For $\\alpha\\le\\tfrac{1}{2}$, the infimum diverges as $\\delta\\downarrow 0$, more precisely it grows on the scale of a positive constant times $\\delta^{-(1-2\\alpha)/\\alpha}$ when $\\alpha<\\tfrac{1}{2}$, and on the scale of a positive constant times $\\log(1/\\delta)$ when $\\alpha=\\tfrac{1}{2}$, capturing the extra energy required to smooth the cusp near $t=0$.**\nThis option correctly describes the behavior for all three regimes of $\\alpha$:\n1.  For $\\alpha > \\frac{1}{2}$, it correctly states that the infimum converges to the finite value $I(\\varphi)$.\n2.  For $\\alpha < \\frac{1}{2}$, it correctly states that the infimum diverges and gives the correct scaling law $\\delta^{-(1-2\\alpha)/\\alpha}$.\n3.  For $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$, it correctly states that the infimum diverges logarithmically.\nThe concluding phrase accurately provides the physical intuition.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The quantity $\\inf_{\\psi\\in B_\\delta(\\varphi)}I(\\psi)$ is always equal to $0$ for any $\\delta>0$ because Brownian motion sample paths are nowhere differentiable and therefore naturally approximate non-smooth targets.**\nThis is incorrect. The LDP cost is determined by the minimum energy required for a path to be in the set, not by the properties of typical (infinite-energy) sample paths. The rate function $I(\\psi)=0$ only if $\\psi(t)=0$ for all $t$. The target path $\\varphi(t)=ct^\\alpha$ is not the zero path, so for sufficiently small $\\delta$, the neighborhood $B_\\delta(\\varphi)$ will not contain the zero path, and the infimum must be strictly greater than $0$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. For any non-smooth target $\\varphi$ (such as a cusp with any $\\alpha\\in(0,1)$), $\\inf_{\\psi\\in B_\\delta(\\varphi)}I(\\psi)=+\\infty$ for all $\\delta>0$, so the event $\\{X^\\varepsilon\\in B_\\delta(\\varphi)\\}$ is super-exponentially unlikely, regardless of the cusp severity.**\nThis is incorrect. While $I(\\varphi)=+\\infty$ for $\\alpha \\le \\frac{1}{2}$, the infimum over an open set $B_\\delta(\\varphi)$ is finite for any $\\delta>0$. We can always construct a path in $H_0^1([0,T])$ (e.g., a polynomial) that is arbitrarily close to $\\varphi$ in the sup-norm, proving the infimum is finite. An infinite infimum would require the set $B_\\delta(\\varphi) \\cap H_0^1([0,T])$ to be empty, which is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The infimum $\\inf_{\\psi\\in B_\\delta(\\varphi)}I(\\psi)$ is attained by a path with a jump discontinuity at $t=0$, which minimizes the energy by bypassing the cusp, and therefore the minimal cost is strictly less than $I(\\varphi)$ for all $\\alpha\\in(0,1)$.**\nThis is incorrect. The entire LDP is formulated on the space of continuous paths $C([0,T];\\mathbb{R})$. A path with a discontinuity is not an element of this space and cannot be a candidate for the infimum. The rate function is defined to be $+\\infty$ for any path that is not absolutely continuous, a much stronger condition than just continuity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. For every $\\alpha\\in(0,1)$, the infimum $\\inf_{\\psi\\in B_\\delta(\\varphi)}I(\\psi)$ decreases linearly to $0$ as $\\delta\\downarrow 0$, because the Cameron–Martin energy penalizes only large deviations and is insensitive to local cusp behavior.**\nThis is incorrect. The behavior of the infimum as $\\delta\\downarrow 0$ is highly sensitive to the cusp exponent $\\alpha$. For $\\alpha > \\frac{1}{2}$, it converges to a non-zero constant $I(\\varphi)$. For $\\alpha \\le \\frac{1}{2}$, it diverges to $+\\infty$. The statement that the energy is insensitive to local behavior is the opposite of the truth; the regularity requirements of the Cameron-Martin space make the energy extremely sensitive to non-smooth features like cusps.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2994982"}]}
