The setup corresponds to a standard problem in the theory of large deviations for stochastic differential equations, specifically concerning exit times from a domain of attraction. The system is a gradient flow perturbed by small-amplitude white noise. The potential `U(x,y)` is well-defined and convex, guaranteeing a unique, globally stable equilibrium. The domain `D` is a simple bounded set. The problem asks for the computation of the exit-time barrier, a well-defined quantity in Freidlin-Wentzell theory. A necessary condition for the problem to be non-trivial is that the stable equilibrium `x_{\\star}` must be inside the domain `D`. The coordinates of `x_{\\star}` are `(-\\alpha, 0)`. The condition `x_{\\star} \\in D` translates to `(-\\alpha)^{2} + 0^{2} < R^{2}`, which simplifies to `\\alpha^{2} < R^{2}`. Since both `\\alpha` and `R` are given to be positive, this is equivalent to `\\alpha < R`. This condition is assumed to hold, as is standard for such exit problems.\n\nAccording to the large deviations theory of Freidlin and Wentzell, for a system described by the stochastic differential equation (SDE) `\\mathrm{d}X^{\\varepsilon}_{t} = b(X^{\\varepsilon}_{t})\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sqrt{\\varepsilon}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{t}`, the expected first exit time `\\tau_{D}^{\\varepsilon}` from a domain `D` starting at a stable equilibrium `x_{\\star} \\in D` satisfies the following asymptotic relation in the small-noise limit `\\varepsilon \\to 0`:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\varepsilon\\to 0}\\,\\varepsilon\\,\\ln \\mathbb{E}_{x_{\\star}}\\!\\left[\\tau_{D}^{\\varepsilon}\\right] = \\inf_{z\\in\\partial D} W(z),\n$$\nwhere `W(z)` is the quasipotential (or action functional minimum) relative to `x_{\\star}`. The problem thus reduces to calculating this infimum.\n\nThe quasipotential `W(z)` is defined as the minimum of the sample-path action functional `S_{T}(\\phi)` over all paths `\\phi` connecting `x_{\\star}` to `z` over any time `T > 0`:\n$$\nW(z) = \\inf_{T>0} \\inf_{\\substack{\\phi \\in C([0,T]; \\mathbb{R}^{2}) \\\\ \\phi(0)=x_{\\star}, \\phi(T)=z}} S_{T}(\\phi).\n$$\nThe action functional for the given SDE, where the drift is `b(z) = -\\nabla U(z)` and the diffusion is isotropic ($\\sigma=I$), is\n$$\nS_{T}(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{T} \\left|\\dot{\\phi}_{s} - b(\\phi_{s})\\right|^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}s = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{T} \\left|\\dot{\\phi}_{s} + \\nabla U(\\phi_{s})\\right|^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}s.\n$$\nFor gradient systems, the quasipotential has a particularly simple form. The optimal path `\\phi^{*}` that minimizes the action functional for a transition from `x_{\\star}` to `z` is the time-reversal of the deterministic trajectory. That is, `\\phi^{*}` satisfies the ordinary differential equation `\\dot{\\phi}^{*}_s = \\nabla U(\\phi^{*}_s)`. Substituting this into the action functional gives:\n$$\nS_{T}(\\phi^{*}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{T} \\left|\\nabla U(\\phi^{*}_{s}) + \\nabla U(\\phi^{*}_{s})\\right|^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}s = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{T} \\left|2\\nabla U(\\phi^{*}_{s})\\right|^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}s = 2 \\int_{0}^{T} \\left|\\nabla U(\\phi^{*}_{s})\\right|^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}s.\n$$\nUsing the relation `\\dot{\\phi}^{*}_s = \\nabla U(\\phi^{*}_s)`, we can rewrite the integrand:\n$$\nS_{T}(\\phi^{*}) = 2 \\int_{0}^{T} \\langle \\nabla U(\\phi^{*}_{s}), \\dot{\\phi}^{*}_{s} \\rangle\\,\\mathrm{d}s.\n$$\nThis is the line integral of `2\\nabla U` along the path `\\phi^{*}`. By the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals, its value is independent of the path and depends only on the endpoints:\n$$\nW(z) = S_{T}(\\phi^{*}) = 2 \\left( U(\\phi^{*}(T)) - U(\\phi^{*}(0)) \\right) = 2 \\left( U(z) - U(x_{\\star}) \\right).\n$$\nThis shows that the quasipotential `W(z)` is simply twice the difference in the potential `U` between the point `z` and the equilibrium `x_{\\star}`.\n\nOur task is now to compute `\\inf_{z\\in\\partial D} W(z)`:\n$$\n\\inf_{z\\in\\partial D} W(z) = \\inf_{z\\in\\partial D} \\left[ 2 \\left( U(z) - U(x_{\\star}) \\right) \\right] = 2 \\left( \\left(\\inf_{z\\in\\partial D} U(z)\\right) - U(x_{\\star}) \\right).\n$$\nWe need to calculate two quantities: `U(x_{\\star})` and `\\inf_{z\\in\\partial D} U(z)`.\n\nFirst, we calculate the potential at the stable equilibrium `x_{\\star} = (-\\alpha, 0)`:\nThe potential is `U(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}(x^{2}+y^{2}) + \\alpha x`.\n$$\nU(x_{\\star}) = U(-\\alpha, 0) = \\frac{1}{2}((-\\alpha)^{2} + 0^{2}) + \\alpha(-\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha^{2} - \\alpha^{2} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha^{2}.\n$$\n\nNext, we find the infimum of `U(z)` on the boundary of the disk, `\\partial D`. The boundary is the circle defined by `x^{2} + y^{2} = R^{2}`. For any point `z=(x,y)` on this circle, the potential becomes:\n$$\nU(x,y)\\bigr|_{\\partial D} = \\frac{1}{2}(R^{2}) + \\alpha x.\n$$\nTo find the infimum of `U` on `\\partial D`, we must find the minimum value of this expression. Since `R` and `\\alpha` are positive constants, we need to minimize the term `\\alpha x` subject to the constraint `x^{2} + y^{2} = R^{2}`. This is equivalent to minimizing `x` itself. The range of possible values for `x` on the circle is `[-R, R]`. The minimum value of `x` is thus `-R`, which occurs at the point `z = (-R, 0)`.\nTherefore, the infimum of the potential on the boundary is:\n$$\n\\inf_{z\\in\\partial D} U(z) = U(-R, 0) = \\frac{1}{2}R^{2} + \\alpha(-R) = \\frac{1}{2}R^{2} - \\alpha R.\n$$\n\nFinally, we substitute these results back into the expression for the exit-time barrier:\n$$\n\\inf_{z\\in\\partial D} W(z) = 2 \\left[ \\left( \\frac{1}{2}R^{2} - \\alpha R \\right) - \\left( -\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha^{2} \\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n= 2 \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}R^{2} - \\alpha R + \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha^{2} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n= R^{2} - 2\\alpha R + \\alpha^{2}.\n$$\nThis expression can be simplified to a perfect square:\n$$\n\\inf_{z\\in\\partial D} W(z) = (R - \\alpha)^{2}.\n$$\nThis is the value of the logarithmic exit-time barrier.

Let the sorted roots be $r_1 < r_2 < r_3$.\nThe stability is determined by the sign of $b'(x) = 1-3x^2$ at the roots. For a tilted double-well potential of this form, the leftmost and rightmost roots correspond to stable equilibria, while the middle root is the saddle.\nTherefore, $a_{0.05} = r_1$ and $s_{0.05} = r_2$. Numerical computation yields the following approximate values for the roots:\n$r_1 \\approx -0.975333$\n$r_2 \\approx -0.0500125$\n$r_3 \\approx 1.025345$\nSo, we have $a_{0.05} \\approx -0.975333$ and $s_{0.05} \\approx -0.0500125$.\n\nThe quasipotential is calculated using the antiderivative $F_{0.05}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^2 - \\frac{1}{4}x^4 + 0.05x$.\n$$\nV(a_{0.05}, s_{0.05}) = -2 \\big( F_{0.05}(s_{0.05}) - F_{0.05}(a_{0.05}) \\big).\n$$\nPlugging in the numerically determined values of $a_{0.05}$ and $s_{0.05}$:\n$F_{0.05}(s_{0.05}) = \\frac{1}{2}(-0.0500125)^2 - \\frac{1}{4}(-0.0500125)^4 + 0.05(-0.0500125) \\approx -0.00125031$.\n$F_{0.05}(a_{0.05}) = \\frac{1}{2}(-0.975333)^2 - \\frac{1}{4}(-0.975333)^4 + 0.05(-0.975333) \\approx 0.200155$.\n$$\nV(a_{0.05}, s_{0.05}) \\approx -2 ( -0.00125031 - 0.200155 ) = -2 ( -0.20140531 ) \\approx 0.40281.\n$$\nA more precise calculation will be performed in the implementation.\n\n**Test Case 3: Quasipotential at the equilibrium, $\\delta=0.05$**\n\nThis case asks for the value of $V(a_{0.05}, a_{0.05})$.\nBy definition, the quasipotential from a point to itself is the infimum of the action functional over all paths starting and ending at that point. The trivial path $x(t) = a_{0.05}$ for all $t$ has $\\dot{x}(t)=0$. Since $a_{0.05}$ is an equilibrium point, $b_{0.05}(a_{0.05})=0$. The action for this path is:\n$$\nS_T[x] = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^T (\\dot{x}(t)-b(x(t)))^2\\,dt = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^T (0-0)^2\\,dt = 0.\n$$\nSince the action is non-negative, this path achieves the infimum, and thus $V(a_{0.05}, a_{0.05}) = 0$.\nThis is also confirmed by the integral formula:\n$$\nV(a_{0.05}, a_{0.05}) = -2 \\int_{a_{0.05}}^{a_{0.05}} b_{0.05}(s)\\,ds = 0.\n$$\nThe value for this test case is exactly $0.0$.\n\nIn summary, the three test cases require a straightforward application of the provided formula for the quasipotential, with the main computational challenge being the numerical determination of polynomial roots in the second case.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the quasipotential for three test cases based on the\n    Freidlin-Wentzell theory for a one-dimensional bistable system.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    results = []\n\n    def F_delta(x, delta):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the antiderivative of the drift b_delta(x) = x - x^3 + delta.\n        The antiderivative is F_delta(x) = 0.5*x^2 - 0.25*x^4 + delta*x.\n        \"\"\"\n        return 0.5 * x**2 - 0.25 * x**4 + delta * x\n\n    def calculate_V(a, s, delta):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the quasipotential V(a, s) = -2 * (F_delta(s) - F_delta(a)).\n        \"\"\"\n        val = -2.0 * (F_delta(s, delta) - F_delta(a, delta))\n        return val\n\n    # --- Test Case 1: delta = 0 ---\n    # The drift is b_0(x) = x - x^3.
