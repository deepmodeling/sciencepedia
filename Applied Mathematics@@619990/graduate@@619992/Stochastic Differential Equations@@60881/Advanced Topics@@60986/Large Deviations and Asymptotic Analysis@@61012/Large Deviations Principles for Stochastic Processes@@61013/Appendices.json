The expectation is given by the integral:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{W_{T}^{2}}{2T}\\right)\\right] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(\\frac{w^{2}}{2T}\\right) p(w) \\,dw = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(\\frac{w^{2}}{2T}\\right) \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi T}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{w^{2}}{2T}\\right) \\,dw.\n$$\nThe exponential terms cancel each other out:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi T}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{w^{2}}{2T} - \\frac{w^{2}}{2T}\\right) \\,dw = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi T}} \\,dw.\n$$\nThis is the integral of a positive constant over an infinite domain, which diverges to $+\\infty$.\nSince the lower bound is infinite, the original expectation must also be infinite. This holds for any $\\varepsilon>0$, and thus for all sufficiently small $\\varepsilon>0$.\n\nVaradhan's lemma connects the limiting behavior of Laplace-type integrals to the rate function. In our case, with a positive sign in the exponent, the lemma would state:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\varepsilon\\to 0} \\varepsilon \\ln \\left( \\int\\exp\\left(\\frac{f(x)}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\,\\mathbb{P}^{\\varepsilon}(dx) \\right) = \\sup_{x\\in C_{0}([0,T])}\\Big(f(x)-I(x)\\Big) = S.\n$$\nFrom Part 1, we know $S=0$. However, we just showed that the integral on the left-hand side is infinite for all $\\varepsilon>0$. Thus, the left-hand side is $\\lim_{\\varepsilon\\to 0} \\varepsilon \\ln(+\\infty)$, which is not well-defined in this form but interpreted as $+\\infty$. Since $+\\infty \\neq 0$, the conclusion of Varadhan's lemma does not hold.\n\nThe failure occurs because a crucial hypothesis of Varadhan's lemma is not satisfied. The lemma requires a certain exponential integrability condition on the functional $f$. Specifically, for the version of the lemma with a positive sign in the exponent, one needs to find a constant $\\gamma > 1$ such that\n$$\n\\limsup_{\\varepsilon\\to 0} \\varepsilon \\ln \\left( \\int\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\gamma f(x)}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\,\\mathbb{P}^{\\varepsilon}(dx) \\right) < \\infty.\n$$\nLet's check this condition. For any $\\gamma > 1$, the integral is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\gamma f(X^{\\varepsilon})}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{2T}\\left(\\sup_{t\\in[0,T]}|W_{t}|\\right)^{2}\\right)\\right].\n$$\nAgain, using the lower bound $|W_T|$:\n$$\n\\geq \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\gamma W_{T}^{2}}{2T}\\right)\\right] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\gamma w^{2}}{2T}\\right) \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi T}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{w^{2}}{2T}\\right) \\,dw = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi T}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(\\frac{(\\gamma-1)w^{2}}{2T}\\right) \\,dw.\n$$\nSince $\\gamma>1$, the term $\\gamma-1$ is positive. The integrand $\\exp(c w^{2})$ with $c>0$ grows quadratically and is not integrable over $\\mathbb{R}$. The integral diverges to $+\\infty$. Thus, the exponential integrability condition fails for any $\\gamma>1$.\n\nThis condition is essential because it ensures that the \"tails\" of the distribution, where $f(x)$ might be large, are controlled. The Laplace principle is based on the idea that for small $\\varepsilon$, the integral is dominated by paths $x$ in a small neighborhood of the points that maximize the expression $f(x)-I(x)$. The exponential integrability condition guarantees that contributions from paths far from these maximizers (where $f(x)$ may be very large) are negligible. In our case, the quadratic growth of $f(x)$ is \"too fast\" relative to the quadratic nature of the rate function $I(x)$ (which governs the exponential decay of probabilities), causing the integral to be dominated by the tails and ultimately diverge. This invalidates the local approximation argument underlying the Laplace principle.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2984127"}]}
