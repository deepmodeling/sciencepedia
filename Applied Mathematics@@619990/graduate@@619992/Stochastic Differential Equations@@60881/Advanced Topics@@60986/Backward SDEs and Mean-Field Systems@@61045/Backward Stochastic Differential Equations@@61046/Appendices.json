The first part requires the derivation of a general representation for the process $Z_t$ in a Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (BSDE) using tools from Malliavin calculus. The second part asks for an explicit computation of $Z_t$ for a specific terminal condition.\n\nPart $1$: Derivation of the representation for $Z_t$.\n\nWe are given the BSDE:\n$$Y_t = h(W_T) + \\int_t^T g(s)\\,ds - \\int_t^T Z_s\\,dW_s, \\quad t\\in[0,T]$$\nwhere $g$ is a deterministic function in $L^2([0,T])$ and $h(W_T) \\in L^2(\\Omega)$ with $h \\in \\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$. The pair $(Y_t, Z_t)$ is the adapted solution to this equation.\n\nWe can rewrite the BSDE in differential form. For $t \\in [0,T]$, the dynamics of $Y_t$ are given by:\n$$dY_t = -g(t)\\,dt + Z_t\\,dW_t$$\nLet us define a new process $M_t$ by adding the deterministic drift term back to $Y_t$:\n$$M_t = Y_t + \\int_0^t g(s)\\,ds$$\nThe stochastic differential of $M_t$ is:\n$$dM_t = dY_t + g(t)\\,dt = (-g(t)\\,dt + Z_t\\,dW_t) + g(t)\\,dt = Z_t\\,dW_t$$\nThis implies that $M_t$ is a local martingale. Since the solution $(Y,Z)$ is assumed to exist in the usual $L^2$ spaces, which implies $\\mathbb{E}[\\int_0^T Z_s^2 ds] < \\infty$, the process $M_t$ is a true martingale.\n\nAs $M_t$ is a martingale with respect to the filtration $\\{\\mathcal{F}_t\\}_{t \\in [0,T]}$, it must satisfy the property $M_t = \\mathbb{E}[M_T | \\mathcal{F}_t]$ for all $t \\in [0,T]$.\nLet's determine the terminal value $M_T$. At time $t=T$, the BSDE gives $Y_T = h(W_T)$. Therefore,\n$$M_T = Y_T + \\int_0^T g(s)\\,ds = h(W_T) + \\int_0^T g(s)\\,ds$$\nSince the integral $\\int_0^T g(s)\\,ds$ is a deterministic constant, the martingale $M_t$ can be expressed as:\n$$M_t = \\mathbb{E}\\left[h(W_T) + \\int_0^T g(s)\\,ds \\, \\middle| \\, \\mathcal{F}_t\\right] = \\mathbb{E}[h(W_T)|\\mathcal{F}_t] + \\int_0^T g(s)\\,ds$$\nThe process $M_t$ is an $\\mathcal{F}_t$-adapted, square-integrable martingale. The filtration $\\{\\mathcal{F}_t\\}_{t \\in [0,T]}$ is generated by the Brownian motion $W_t$. The Martingale Representation Theorem states that any such martingale can be written as a stochastic integral with respect to $W_t$. We already have one such representation from the definition of $M_t$:\n$$M_t = M_0 + \\int_0^t Z_s\\,dW_s$$\nThe Clark-Ocone formula provides an explicit expression for the integrand in the martingale representation of functionals of Brownian motion. Specifically, for an $\\mathcal{F}_T$-measurable random variable $F \\in \\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$, the martingale $N_t = \\mathbb{E}[F|\\mathcal{F}_t]$ has the representation:\n$$N_t = \\mathbb{E}[F] + \\int_0^t \\mathbb{E}[D_s F | \\mathcal{F}_s]\\,dW_s$$\nwhere $D_s$ is the Malliavin derivative operator.\n\nLet's apply this to our martingale $M_t = \\mathbb{E}[M_T|\\mathcal{F}_t]$. The integrand in its representation is given by $\\mathbb{E}[D_t M_T | \\mathcal{F}_t]$. By the uniqueness of the martingale representation integrand, we can identify $Z_t$ with this expression:\n$$Z_t = \\mathbb{E}[D_t M_T | \\mathcal{F}_t]$$\nWe now compute the Malliavin derivative of $M_T$:\n$$D_t M_T = D_t \\left(h(W_T) + \\int_0^T g(s)\\,ds\\right)$$\nThe Malliavin derivative is a linear operator. The term $\\int_0^T g(s)\\,ds$ is a deterministic constant, and the Malliavin derivative of any constant is $0$. Therefore:\n$$D_t M_T = D_t h(W_T) + D_t\\left(\\int_0^T g(s)\\,ds\\right) = D_t h(W_T) + 0 = D_t h(W_T)$$\nSubstituting this back into our expression for $Z_t$, we obtain the desired result:\n$$Z_t = \\mathbb{E}[D_t h(W_T) | \\mathcal{F}_t]$$\nThis holds for almost every $t \\in [0,T]$. This result shows that the integrand $Z_t$ in the BSDE is the conditional expectation of the Malliavin derivative of the terminal value functional $h(W_T)$. The term involving $g(s)$ affects the process $Y_t$ but not the martingale component $Z_t$.\n\nPart $2$: Explicit computation for $h(x)=x^2$.\n\nWe are given the specific terminal condition functional $h(x) = x^2$, so the terminal condition is $Y_T = h(W_T) = W_T^2$. To find $Z_t$, we use the formula derived in Part $1$:\n$$Z_t = \\mathbb{E}[D_t(W_T^2) | \\mathcal{F}_t]$$\nFirst, we compute the Malliavin derivative $D_t(W_T^2)$. We use the chain rule for the Malliavin derivative, which states that for a differentiable function $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ and a Malliavin differentiable random variable $F$, $D_t(f(F)) = f'(F) D_t(F)$.\nHere, $f(x)=x^2$ and $F=W_T$. The derivative is $f'(x) = 2x$. So,\n$$D_t(W_T^2) = 2 W_T \\cdot D_t(W_T)$$\nThe Malliavin derivative of the Brownian motion $W_s$ at time $t$ is the indicator function $D_t(W_s) = \\mathbf{1}_{[0,s]}(t)$. For $s=T$, we have $D_t(W_T) = \\mathbf{1}_{[0,T]}(t)$. Since we are considering $t \\in [0,T]$, this is equal to 1 for almost every $t$ in this interval.\nThus, the Malliavin derivative is:\n$$D_t(W_T^2) = 2W_T \\cdot 1 = 2W_T$$\nNow, we substitute this into the expression for $Z_t$:\n$$Z_t = \\mathbb{E}[2W_T | \\mathcal{F}_t]$$\nBy linearity of conditional expectation, this becomes:\n$$Z_t = 2 \\mathbb{E}[W_T | \\mathcal{F}_t]$$\nTo evaluate the conditional expectation, we use the property that Brownian motion is a martingale. We can write $W_T$ as the sum of its value at time $t$ and a future increment:\n$$W_T = W_t + (W_T - W_t)$$\nTaking the conditional expectation with respect to $\\mathcal{F}_t$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[W_T | \\mathcal{F}_t] = \\mathbb{E}[W_t + (W_T - W_t) | \\mathcal{F}_t] = \\mathbb{E}[W_t | \\mathcal{F}_t] + \\mathbb{E}[W_T - W_t | \\mathcal{F}_t]$$\nSince $W_t$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable, $\\mathbb{E}[W_t | \\mathcal{F}_t] = W_t$. The increment $W_T - W_t$ is independent of the filtration $\\mathcal{F}_t$ for $t < T$. Therefore, its conditional expectation is equal to its unconditional expectation:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[W_T - W_t | \\mathcal{F}_t] = \\mathbb{E}[W_T - W_t] = \\mathbb{E}[W_T] - \\mathbb{E}[W_t] = 0 - 0 = 0$$\nCombining these results, we get:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[W_T | \\mathcal{F}_t] = W_t + 0 = W_t$$\nFinally, we substitute this back into the expression for $Z_t$:\n$$Z_t = 2 \\mathbb{E}[W_T | \\mathcal{F}_t] = 2W_t$$\nThis is the explicit closed-form expression for $Z_t$ as a function of $t$ and $W_t$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2W_t}$$", "id": "2969602"}]}
