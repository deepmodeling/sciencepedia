The problem requires the simulation of an $N$-particle system that approximates a McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation (SDE), and the comparison of the simulation's output statistics against theoretically derived values. The scientific premises, including the form of the SDE and the theoretical mean and variance, are correct. The provided parameters are complete and computationally feasible. Therefore, a solution can be constructed.\n\nThe foundation of this problem is the McKean–Vlasov SDE:\n$$\ndX_t = (X_t - \\mathbb{E}[X_t])\\,dt + dW_t\n$$\nwhere $t \\in [0,T]$, $W_t$ is a standard Brownian motion, and the initial law of $X_0$ has mean $m_0$ and variance $s_0^2$. This equation is a mean-field model where the drift of a particle depends on the expectation of its own process, which represents an interaction with the entire population.\n\nFirst, we derive the theoretical mean and variance, which serve as benchmarks for our numerical simulation. Let $m_t = \\mathbb{E}[X_t]$. Taking the expectation of the SDE, and noting that $\\mathbb{E}[dW_t]=0$, we obtain:\n$$\nd\\mathbb{E}[X_t] = \\mathbb{E}[X_t - \\mathbb{E}[X_t]]\\,dt = (\\mathbb{E}[X_t] - \\mathbb{E}[X_t])\\,dt = 0\n$$\nThis implies that $m_t$ is constant. Thus, for any time $T$, the mean is conserved:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_T] = m_0\n$$\nThis is the first theoretical target.\n\nNext, we derive the variance $v_t = \\operatorname{Var}(X_t) = \\mathbb{E}[X_t^2] - m_t^2$. Using Itô's lemma for the function $f(x)=x^2$, we have $d(X_t^2) = 2X_t dX_t + (dX_t)^2$. Substituting the SDE and using the Itô multiplication rule $(dW_t)^2=dt$, we get:\n$$\nd(X_t^2) = 2X_t\\left((X_t - m_0)\\,dt + dW_t\\right) + \\left((X_t - m_0)\\,dt + dW_t\\right)^2 = (2X_t^2 - 2m_0 X_t + 1)\\,dt + 2X_t dW_t\n$$\nTaking the expectation, the stochastic integral term $\\mathbb{E}[2X_t dW_t]$ vanishes. Let $E_t = \\mathbb{E}[X_t^2]$. We are left with an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $E_t$:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_t}{dt} = 2\\mathbb{E}[X_t^2] - 2m_0\\mathbb{E}[X_t] + 1 = 2E_t - 2m_0^2 + 1\n$$\nThe solution to this linear ODE with initial condition $E_0 = \\mathbb{E}[X_0^2] = s_0^2 + m_0^2$ is:\n$$\nE_t = (s_0^2 + m_0^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2})e^{2t} - (m_0^2 - \\tfrac{1}{2})\n$$\nNo, the derivation is simpler. The general solution is $E_t = C e^{2t} + m_0^2 - \\tfrac{1}{2}$. Using $E_0 = s_0^2 + m_0^2$, we find $C = s_0^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2}$. Thus,\n$$\nE_t = (s_0^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2})e^{2t} + m_0^2 - \\tfrac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe variance is $v_t = E_t - m_t^2 = E_t - m_0^2$:\n$$\nv_t = (s_0^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2})e^{2t} - \\tfrac{1}{2} = s_0^2 e^{2t} + \\tfrac{1}{2}(e^{2t} - 1)\n$$\nAt the final time $T$, the theoretical variance is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(X_T) = s_0^2 e^{2T} + \\tfrac{1}{2}(e^{2T} - 1)\n$$\nThis confirms the formula provided in the problem statement.\n\nThe numerical solution involves simulating the associated $N$-particle interacting system, where the population expectation $\\mathbb{E}[X_t]$ is approximated by the empirical mean of the particles, $\\bar{X}_t = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^N X_t^{(j)}$. The SDE for each particle $i$ is:\n$$\ndX_t^{(i)} = \\left(X_t^{(i)} - \\bar{X}_t\\right)\\,dt + dW_t^{(i)}\n$$\nWe discretize this system using the Euler-Maruyama scheme with a time step $\\Delta t$. The update rule for particle $i$ from time $t_k = k \\Delta t$ to $t_{k+1} = (k+1)\\Delta t$ is:\n$$\nX_{t_{k+1}}^{(i)} = X_{t_k}^{(i)} + \\left(X_{t_k}^{(i)} - \\bar{X}_{t_k}\\right)\\Delta t + \\sqrt{\\Delta t}\\,Z_k^{(i)}\n$$\nwhere $Z_k^{(i)}$ are independent and identically distributed standard normal random variables, $\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$.\n\nThe implementation will follow these steps for each test case:\n1.  Initialize the pseudo-random number generator using the specified `seed`.\n2.  Generate the initial positions of the $N$ particles, $\\{X_0^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^N$, from the specified initial law (Gaussian, degenerate, or uniform). The parameters for each law are given ($m_0, s_0$).\n3.  Simulate the system for a total of `num_steps` = $\\text{round}(T/\\Delta t)$ iterations. In each step, we compute the empirical mean of all particles and then update each particle's position according to the vectorized Euler-Maruyama rule.\n4.  After the final time step, compute the empirical mean $\\hat{m}_T$ and the unbiased empirical variance $\\hat{v}_T = \\frac{1}{N-1}\\sum_{i=1}^N (X_T^{(i)} - \\hat{m}_T)^2$ of the final particle positions $\\{X_T^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^N$.\n5.  Calculate the theoretical variance target $v_T = s_0^2 e^{2T} + \\tfrac{1}{2}(e^{2T} - 1)$. The theoretical mean target is $m_T = m_0$.\n6.  Compare the empirical results to the theoretical targets using the provided tolerances. The conditions are $|\\hat{m}_T - m_T| \\le \\text{mean\\_tol}$ and $|\\hat{v}_T - v_T| \\le \\text{var\\_tol}$.\n7.  The final output for the case is the boolean result of the logical conjunction (`AND`) of these two conditions.\n\nThis procedure is deterministic for a given seed and set of parameters, allowing for reproducible verification.

Let's analyze the dynamics of $Z_t^N$ and then take the limit.\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}Z_{t}^{N} = \\sqrt{N}(\\mathrm{d}m_{t}^{N} - \\mathrm{d}m_{t}) = \\sqrt{N}\\left( -(a-b)m_{t}^{N}\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{N}}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\tilde{W}_{t}^{N} - (-(a-b)m_{t}\\,\\mathrm{d}t) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}Z_{t}^{N} = -(a-b) \\sqrt{N}(m_{t}^{N}-m_{t})\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}\\tilde{W}_{t}^{N}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}Z_{t}^{N} = -(a-b)Z_{t}^{N}\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}\\tilde{W}_{t}^{N}.\n$$\nAs $N \\to \\infty$, $Z_{t}^{N}$ converges in law to a process $Z_{t}$ which solves the linear SDE, or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}Z_{t} = -(a-b)Z_{t}\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{t},\n$$\nwhere $W_{t}$ is a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion. This SDE represents the linearized evolution for the observable $\\varphi(x)=x$. The linearized semigroup is generated by the operator acting on $Z_t$, which is multiplication by $-(a-b)$.\n\nThe initial condition for this SDE is $Z_{0} = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\sqrt{N}(m_{0}^{N} - m_{0})$. Since the initial positions $X_{0}^{i,N}$ are i.i.d. with mean $m_{0}$ and variance $v_{0}$, the Central Limit Theorem states that $\\sqrt{N}(m_{0}^{N} - m_{0}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(X_{0}^{i,N} - m_{0})$ converges in distribution to a Gaussian random variable with mean $0$ and variance $v_{0}$. Thus, $Z_{0} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, v_{0})$.\n\nWe need to compute $\\lim_{N\\to\\infty}\\operatorname{Var}(Z_{t}^{N}) = \\operatorname{Var}(Z_t)$. The solution to the SDE for $Z_t$ with initial condition $Z_0$ is given by:\n$$\nZ_{t} = Z_{0}\\,\\exp(-(a-b)t) + \\sigma \\int_{0}^{t} \\exp(-(a-b)(t-s))\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{s}.\n$$\nTo find the variance, we first compute the mean $\\mathbb{E}[Z_t]$. Since $\\mathbb{E}[Z_{0}]=0$ and the Itô integral has zero mean,\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Z_{t}] = \\mathbb{E}[Z_{0}]\\,\\exp(-(a-b)t) + \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sigma \\int_{0}^{t} \\exp(-(a-b)(t-s))\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{s}\\right] = 0.\n$$\nThe variance is therefore $\\operatorname{Var}(Z_{t}) = \\mathbb{E}[Z_{t}^{2}]$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Z_{t}^{2}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\left(Z_{0}\\,\\exp(-(a-b)t) + \\sigma \\int_{0}^{t} \\exp(-(a-b)(t-s))\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{s}\\right)^{2} \\right].\n$$\nExpanding the square gives three terms. The cross-term's expectation is zero because $Z_{0}$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{0}$-measurable and thus independent of the Wiener process increments for $s>0$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[ 2 Z_{0}\\,\\exp(-(a-b)t) \\sigma \\int_{0}^{t} \\exp(-(a-b)(t-s))\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{s} \\right] = 2\\sigma\\,\\exp(-(a-b)t)\\,\\mathbb{E}[Z_{0}]\\,\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{t} \\dots \\mathrm{d}W_{s}\\right] = 0.\n$$\nThus, the variance is the sum of the variances of the two terms:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(Z_{t}) = \\mathbb{E}[Z_{0}^{2}\\,\\exp(-2(a-b)t)] + \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\sigma \\int_{0}^{t} \\exp(-(a-b)(t-s))\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{s}\\right)^{2}\\right].\n$$\nThe first term is $\\operatorname{Var}(Z_{0})\\,\\exp(-2(a-b)t) = v_{0}\\,\\exp(-2(a-b)t)$.\nFor the second term, we use Itô's isometry:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\sigma \\int_{0}^{t} \\exp(-(a-b)(t-s))\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{s}\\right)^{2}\\right] = \\sigma^{2} \\int_{0}^{t} \\left(\\exp(-(a-b)(t-s))\\right)^{2}\\mathrm{d}s\n$$\n$$\n= \\sigma^{2} \\int_{0}^{t} \\exp(-2(a-b)(t-s))\\,\\mathrm{d}s.\n$$\nLet $u = s$.
