It presents a standard exercise in stochastic calculus concerning the Geometric Brownian Motion process, Itô's formula, and the concept of Lyapunov exponents. All conditions are formally stated and mathematically consistent. Therefore, a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe one-dimensional linear stochastic differential equation (SDE) is given by:\n$$\ndX_t = a X_t dt + b X_t dW_t\n$$\nwith initial condition $X_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{0\\}$, where $a$ and $b$ are real constants and $W_t$ is a standard Brownian motion.\n\nFirst, we derive the explicit strong solution for $X_t$ using Itô's formula. We define the function $f(x) = \\ln|x|$ for $x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{0\\}$. The problem correctly notes that $X_t$ will almost surely not be zero for any $t > 0$ if $X_0 \\neq 0$, so $f(X_t)$ is well-defined.

The term $W_t$ is a random variable. By definition, for a standard Brownian motion, $W_t$ is normally distributed with mean $0$ and variance $t$, i.e., $W_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t)$.\nThe term $\\frac{b}{t}W_t$ is a linear transformation of a normal random variable.

So, $\\frac{b}{t}W_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\frac{b^2}{t})$.\nThe random variable $Z_t$ is the sum of a normal random variable and a constant. Therefore, $Z_t$ is also normally distributed. Its mean is:\n$$\nE[Z_t] = E\\left[\\frac{\\ln|X_0|}{t} + a - \\frac{1}{2}b^2 + \\frac{b}{t}W_t\\right] = \\frac{\\ln|X_0|}{t} + a - \\frac{1}{2}b^2\n$$\nIts variance is:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(Z_t) = \\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{\\ln|X_0|}{t} + a - \\frac{1}{2}b^2 + \\frac{b}{t}W_t\\right) = \\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{b}{t}W_t\\right) = \\frac{b^2}{t}\n$$\nThus, the probability law of $\\frac{1}{t}\\ln|X_t|$ is a Normal distribution with these parameters:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{t}\\ln|X_t| \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(a - \\frac{1}{2}b^2 + \\frac{\\ln|X_0|}{t}, \\frac{b^2}{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the top Lyapunov exponent $\\lambda$, defined as the almost sure (a.s.) limit:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{t}\\ln|X_t| \\quad \\text{(a.s.)}\n$$\nWe take the limit of the expression for $\\frac{1}{t}\\ln|X_t|$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\left(a - \\frac{1}{2}b^2 + \\frac{\\ln|X_0|}{t} + b\\frac{W_t}{t}\\right)\n$$\nWe analyze the limit of each term:\n1. The term $a - \\frac{1}{2}b^2$ is a constant.\n2. The term $\\frac{\\ln|X_0|}{t}$ vanishes as $t \\to \\infty$ because $X_0$ is a fixed non-zero constant, making $\\ln|X_0|$ a finite value.\n$$\n\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\ln|X_0|}{t} = 0\n$$\n3.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of Lyapunov Exponents\n\n#### 1. The Itô Stochastic Differential Equation\nThe first SDE is given in Itô form:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}X_t = a\\,X_t\\,\\mathrm{d}t + b\\,X_t\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t, \\quad X_0 \\neq 0 $$\nTo solve this equation, we seek a transformation that simplifies it. Let us consider the process $Z_t = \\ln|X_t|$. Since $X_0 \\neq 0$ and the solution to this SDE is an exponential function, $X_t$ will not cross zero, so its sign remains constant. We can apply Itô's formula to the function $f(x) = \\ln|x|$. The derivatives of $f(x)$ are $f'(x) = 1/x$ and $f''(x) = -1/x^2$ for $x \\neq 0$.\nAccording to Itô's formula, for a process $X_t$ and a twice-differentiable function $f$, the differential of $f(X_t)$ is:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}f(X_t) = f'(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}X_t + \\frac{1}{2}f''(X_t)\\,(\\mathrm{d}X_t)^2 $$\nThe quadratic variation $(\\mathrm{d}X_t)^2$ is calculated using the Itô rules $(\\mathrm{d}t)^2 = 0$, $\\mathrm{d}t\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t = 0$, and $(\\mathrm{d}W_t)^2 = \\mathrm{d}t$:\n$$ (\\mathrm{d}X_t)^2 = (a\\,X_t\\,\\mathrm{d}t + b\\,X_t\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t)^2 = (b\\,X_t)^2\\,(\\mathrm{d}W_t)^2 = b^2\\,X_t^2\\,\\mathrm{d}t $$\nSubstituting $\\mathrm{d}X_t$ and $(\\mathrm{d}X_t)^2$ into Itô's formula for $Z_t = \\ln|X_t|$:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}Z_t = \\frac{1}{X_t}(a\\,X_t\\,\\mathrm{d}t + b\\,X_t\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(-\\frac{1}{X_t^2}\\right)(b^2\\,X_t^2\\,\\mathrm{d}t) $$\n$$ \\mathrm{d}Z_t = (a\\,\\mathrm{d}t + b\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t) - \\frac{1}{2}b^2\\,\\mathrm{d}t $$\n$$ \\mathrm{d}Z_t = \\left(a - \\frac{1}{2}b^2\\right)\\mathrm{d}t + b\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t $$\nIntegrating this linear SDE from $0$ to $t$ gives:\n$$ Z_t - Z_0 = \\int_0^t \\left(a - \\frac{1}{2}b^2\\right)\\mathrm{d}s + \\int_0^t b\\,\\mathrm{d}W_s $$\n$$ \\ln|X_t| - \\ln|X_0| = \\left(a - \\frac{1}{2}b^2\\right)t + b\\,W_t $$\nThis gives the explicit solution for $|X_t|$:\n$$ |X_t| = |X_0|\\,\\exp\\left(\\left(a - \\frac{1}{2}b^2\\right)t + b\\,W_t\\right) $$\nNow, we compute the top Lyapunov exponent, denoted $\\lambda_I$, using its definition:\n$$ \\lambda_I = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{t}\\ln|X_t| = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{t}\\left[\\ln|X_0| + \\left(a - \\frac{1}{2}b^2\\right)t + b\\,W_t\\right] $$\n$$ \\lambda_I = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left[\\frac{\\ln|X_0|}{t} + \\left(a - \\frac{1}{2}b^2\\right) + \\frac{b\\,W_t}{t}\\right] $$\nThe first term vanishes as $t \\to \\infty$. By the strong law of large numbers for Brownian motion, $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{W_t}{t} = 0$ almost surely. Therefore, the limit becomes:\n$$ \\lambda_I = a - \\frac{1}{2}b^2 $$\n\n#### 2. The Stratonovich Stochastic Differential Equation\nThe second SDE is given in Stratonovich form:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}Y_t = a\\,Y_t\\,\\mathrm{d}t + b\\,Y_t \\circ \\mathrm{d}W_t, \\quad Y_0 \\neq 0 $$\nTo find its Lyapunov exponent, the most direct method is to convert it to its equivalent Itô form. For a general Stratonovich SDE $\\mathrm{d}Z_t = \\mu(Z_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma(Z_t) \\circ \\mathrm{d}W_t$, the equivalent Itô SDE is $\\mathrm{d}Z_t = [\\mu(Z_t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma'(Z_t)\\sigma(Z_t)]\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma(Z_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$.\nFor our SDE, we have $\\mu(y) = a\\,y$ and $\\sigma(y) = b\\,y$. The derivative is $\\sigma'(y) = b$. The correction term is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma'(y)\\sigma(y) = \\frac{1}{2}(b)(b\\,y) = \\frac{1}{2}b^2\\,y $$\nThe drift of the equivalent Itô SDE is $a\\,y + \\frac{1}{2}b^2\\,y = (a + \\frac{1}{2}b^2)y$. The diffusion term remains $b\\,y$. Thus, the equivalent Itô SDE for $Y_t$ is:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}Y_t = \\left(a + \\frac{1}{2}b^2\\right)Y_t\\,\\mathrm{d}t + b\\,Y_t\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t $$\nThis SDE has the same form as the first one, with the drift coefficient $a$ replaced by $a' = a + \\frac{1}{2}b^2$. We can directly use the formula for the Lyapunov exponent derived for the Itô case, substituting $a'$ for $a$:\n$$ \\lambda_S = a' - \\frac{1}{2}b^2 = \\left(a + \\frac{1}{2}b^2\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}b^2 = a $$\nThe top Lyapunov exponent for the Stratonovich SDE is simply:\n$$ \\lambda_S = a $$\nThis result reflects that Stratonovich calculus follows the rules of ordinary calculus, so the long-term stability is governed by the deterministic drift, just as in the ODE $\\mathrm{d}y/\\mathrm{d}t = a\\,y$.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nGiven the parameter values $a = 0.1$ and $b = 1$:\n- The Lyapunov exponent for the Itô SDE is:\n$$ \\lambda_I = a - \\frac{1}{2}b^2 = 0.1 - \\frac{1}{2}(1)^2 = 0.1 - 0.5 = -0.4 $$\n- The Lyapunov exponent for the Stratonovich SDE is:\n$$ \\lambda_S = a = 0.1 $$\n\n### Dynamical Consequences\nThe sign of the Lyapunov exponent determines the almost sure long-term behavior of the system's trajectories. For a solution $Z_t$, the relation $|Z_t| \\sim \\exp(\\lambda t)$ holds for large $t$. The zero solution ($Z_t=0$) is an equilibrium point for both systems.\n\n- For the Itô SDE, the Lyapunov exponent is $\\lambda_I = -0.4$, which is negative. This implies that almost all sample paths decay to zero exponentially, i.e., $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} X_t = 0$ almost surely. The zero solution $X_t=0$ is almost surely asymptotically stable. This is an example of noise-induced stabilization, as the deterministic part $(\\dot{x} = 0.1x)$ is unstable, but the multiplicative noise is strong enough to stabilize the system.\n\n- For the Stratonovich SDE, the Lyapunov exponent is $\\lambda_S = 0.1$, which is positive. This implies that almost all sample paths grow exponentially without bound, i.e., $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} |Y_t| = \\infty$ almost surely. The zero solution $Y_t=0$ is unstable. The long-term behavior is identical to that of the deterministic system $\\dot{y} = 0.1y$, which is also unstable.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -0.4 & 0.1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2986110"}, {"introduction": "Analytical solutions are rare, making numerical methods indispensable for studying complex, multidimensional systems.

This approach is numerically untenable for two reasons:\n1.  **Anisotropy of Growth**: The columns of $\\Phi_t$ will tend to align along the Oseledets filtration, with most columns aligning with the direction of the fastest growth, corresponding to $\\lambda_1$. This leads to the matrix $\\Phi_t$ becoming severely ill-conditioned, making the numerical determination of its singular values impossible.\n2.  **Overflow/Underflow**: The norm of $\\Phi_t$ typically grows or decays exponentially at a rate determined by $\\lambda_1$. For large $T$, its elements would exceed the floating-point range of a computer, causing overflow (if $\\lambda_1 > 0$) or underflow (if $\\lambda_1 < 0$).\n\n**3. The Discrete Orthonormalization (QR-based) Method**\n\nTo circumvent these issues, we employ a method developed by Benettin et al. for deterministic systems and extended to stochastic contexts. The core idea is to avoid the direct computation of $\\Phi_t$ and instead track an evolving orthonormal basis that spans the same subspaces as the columns of $\\Phi_t$. The exponential growth is factored out at each step and accumulated logarithmically.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\nLet the time interval $[0, T]$ be discretized into $N$ steps of size $\\Delta t = T/N$, with $t_j = j \\Delta t$.\nWe start with an orthonormal basis represented by the columns of a matrix $Q_0 = I_n$. We then iterate:\n\n**a. Discretization and Propagation:**\nWe use the Euler-Maruyama scheme to approximate the SDE over one time step. The solution at $t_{j+1}$ is related to the solution at $t_j$ by:\n$$\n\\Phi_{t_{j+1}} \\approx \\left( I_n + A \\Delta t + \\sum_{k=1}^{m} B_k \\Delta W_j^{(k)} \\right) \\Phi_{t_j}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta W_j^{(k)} = W_{t_{j+1}}^{(k)} - W_{t_j}^{(k)}$ are independent random variables drawn from a normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\Delta t)$. We can write $\\Delta W_j^{(k)} = \\xi_j^{(k)} \\sqrt{\\Delta t}$, where $\\xi_j^{(k)} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.\n\nInstead of propagating $\\Phi_t$, we propagate the orthonormal basis $Q_j$. We compute the matrix of un-normalized basis vectors at the next step, $Z_{j+1}$:\n$$\nZ_{j+1} = \\left( I_n + A \\Delta t + \\sum_{k=1}^{m} B_k \\xi_j^{(k)} \\sqrt{\\Delta t} \\right) Q_j\n$$\nThe matrix $Z_{j+1}$ represents the image of the orthonormal basis $Q_j$ after one step of the discretized flow. Its columns are neither orthogonal nor of unit length.\n\n**b. Orthonormalization via QR Decomposition:**\nWe apply the QR decomposition to $Z_{j+1}$ to separate it into a new orthonormal basis $Q_{j+1}$ and an upper-triangular matrix $R_{j+1}$ that captures the local growth and rotation:\n$$\nZ_{j+1} = Q_{j+1} R_{j+1}\n$$\nThe matrix $Q_{j+1}$ becomes the basis for the next iteration.\n\n**c. Accumulation of Lyapunov Exponents:**\nThe fundamental insight is that the long-term dynamics are captured in the sequence of $R_j$ matrices. The total evolution after $N$ steps can be seen as a product $\\Phi_{t_N} \\approx Q_N R_N R_{N-1} \\dots R_1$. While this product is hard to analyze directly, the MET implies that the individual Lyapunov exponents can be estimated from the geometric mean of the diagonal elements of the $R_j$ matrices. The rate of expansion of the $i$-th basis vector, already orthogonalized with respect to the first $i-1$ vectors, is given by the $i$-th diagonal element $(R_j)_{ii}$.\n\nThe exponents are thus estimated by the time average of the logarithms of the magnitudes of these diagonal elements:\n$$\n\\lambda_i \\approx \\frac{1}{N \\Delta t} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\log \\left| (R_j)_{ii} \\right| = \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\log \\left| (R_j)_{ii} \\right|\n$$\nThe absolute value is necessary as the QR decomposition is not unique with respect to the signs of the columns of $Q$ and the diagonal of $R$. This procedure reliably separates the different growth rates and avoids both ill-conditioning and numerical overflow/underflow, as the norm of $Q_j$ is always unity. The ordering $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_n$ emerges naturally from the prioritized nature of the Gram-Schmidt process underlying the QR decomposition.\n\n**4. Verification for Commuting Diagonal Systems**\n\nFor the special cases where the matrices $A$ and all $\\{B_k\\}$ are diagonal, the SDE decouples into $n$ independent scalar equations for each component $x_i$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}x_i = A_{ii} x_i \\mathrm{d}t + \\sum_{k=1}^{m} (B_k)_{ii} x_i \\mathrm{d}W_t^{(k)}\n$$\nThis is a standard geometric Brownian motion, whose exact solution is known. The Lyapunov exponent for the $i$-th component is given by the deterministic formula:\n$$\n\\lambda_i = A_{ii} - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^{m} (B_k)_{ii}^2\n$$\nThis provides an exact theoretical value against which the numerical estimates for test cases 1, 2, 3, and 4 can be validated. For instance, for Case 1 ($n=1, m=1, A=0.1, B_1=0.5$), the theoretical exponent is $\\lambda_1 = 0.1 - \\frac{1}{2}(0.5)^2 = -0.025$. For the deterministic Case 4 ($m=0$), the exponents are simply the real parts of the eigenvalues of $A$. The provided algorithm should closely approximate these theoretical values.", "answer": "[[-0.024982],[0.099959,-0.350106],[0.030019,-0.005072,-0.145065],[-0.050000,-0.200000]]", "id": "2986135"}]}
