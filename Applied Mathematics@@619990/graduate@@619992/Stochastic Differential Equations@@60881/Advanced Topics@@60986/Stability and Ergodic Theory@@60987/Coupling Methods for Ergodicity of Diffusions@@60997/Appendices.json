Subtracting the second SDE from the first, we obtain the evolution equation for $Z_{t}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}Z_{t} \\;=\\; \\mathrm{d}X^{x}_{t} - \\mathrm{d}X^{y}_{t} \\;=\\; (- A X^{x}_{t} \\,\\mathrm{d}t \\;+\\; \\sqrt{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}B_{t}) - (- A X^{y}_{t} \\,\\mathrm{d}t \\;+\\; \\sqrt{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}B_{t})\n$$\nThe Brownian motion terms cancel out due to the synchronous coupling.\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}Z_{t} \\;=\\; - A (X^{x}_{t} - X^{y}_{t}) \\,\\mathrm{d}t \\;=\\; - A Z_{t} \\,\\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nThis is a deterministic linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $Z_{t}$.

To show that $m$ is the largest such uniform rate, we must demonstrate that no rate $\\lambda > m$ works for all initial conditions. Let $v_{m}$ be an eigenvector of $A$ corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue $m$. Let the initial difference be $x-y = v_{m}$. Then $Z_{0} = v_{m}$. The solution for $Z_{t}$ is:\n$$\nZ_{t} = \\exp(-At) v_{m} = \\exp(-mt) v_{m}\n$$\nThe norm is then:\n$$\n|Z_{t}| = |\\exp(-mt) v_{m}| = \\exp(-mt) |v_{m}| = \\exp(-mt) |x-y|\n$$\nIn this case, the inequality $|Z_{t}| \\le \\exp(-\\lambda t) |x-y|$ becomes $\\exp(-mt) \\le \\exp(-\\lambda t)$, which is only true for all $t\\ge 0$ if $\\lambda \\le m$. Thus, $m$ is the largest possible uniform contraction rate.\nTherefore, $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{sync}} = m$.\nThis result implies a contraction for the $2$-Wasserstein distance $W_{2}$.

Thus, the invariant measure is $\\mu = N(0, A^{-1})$.\n\nThe spectral gap $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{gap}}$ is the optimal constant in the Poincaré inequality:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mu}(f) \\;\\le\\; \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{gap}}}\\,\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}} |\\nabla f(x)|^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu(x)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mu}(f) = \\int (f - \\int f d\\mu)^{2} d\\mu$.\nA fundamental result, often associated with the Bakry-Émery criterion or directly provable for Gaussian measures, states that for a Gaussian measure $\\mu = N(0, \\Sigma)$, the optimal constant in the Poincaré inequality is the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix $\\Sigma$. That is, $1/\\lambda_{\\mathrm{gap}} = \\lambda_{\\max}(\\Sigma)$.\nIn our case, the covariance matrix is $\\Sigma = A^{-1}$. The eigenvalues of $A^{-1}$ are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of $A$. Let the eigenvalues of $A$ be $0 < m = \\lambda_{\\min}(A) \\le \\dots \\le \\lambda_{\\max}(A) = L$. The eigenvalues of $A^{-1}$ are $1/L \\le \\dots \\le 1/m$.\nThe largest eigenvalue of $\\Sigma=A^{-1}$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max}(A^{-1}) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\min}(A)} = \\frac{1}{m}\n$$\nFrom the Poincaré inequality, we have $1/\\lambda_{\\mathrm{gap}} = 1/m$, which implies $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{gap}} = m$.\n\nAlternatively, one can compute the spectrum of the generator of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, $\\mathcal{L} = -Ax \\cdot \\nabla + \\Delta$. The spectral gap is the smallest non-zero eigenvalue of $-\\mathcal{L}$. By diagonalizing $A = P D P^{\\top}$ where $D=\\mathrm{diag}(\\lambda_{1}, \\dots, \\lambda_{d})$, the SDE decouples into $d$ independent one-dimensional OU processes. The spectrum of $-\\mathcal{L}$ is the set of all sums $\\sum_{i=1}^{d} k_i \\lambda_i$ for non-negative integers $k_i$. The smallest non-zero eigenvalue corresponds to setting one $k_j=1$ and the others to $0$, which gives the set of eigenvalues $\\{\\lambda_{1}, \\dots, \\lambda_{d}\\}$. The spectral gap is the minimum of these:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\mathrm{gap}} = \\min_{i} \\{\\lambda_i\\} = m\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Comparison**\n\nFrom Part 1, we found the optimal synchronous coupling contraction rate to be $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{sync}} = m$.\nFrom Part 2, we found the spectral gap of the generator to be $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{gap}} = m$.\nThe two rates are identical. The common value is the smallest eigenvalue of the matrix $A$, which is denoted by $m$.

A standard and logical interpretation in this context is to compute the relative entropy of the controlled path law of $Y_t$ with respect to the uncontrolled path law starting at the same point $y$. Let $\\mu_y$ denote the law of the process $d\\tilde{Y}_t = b(\\tilde{Y}_t)dt + \\sigma dB_t$ with $\\tilde{Y}_0=y$. The relative entropy between the law of our controlled process $Y_t$ (denoted $\\mathbb{P}^Y$) and $\\mu_y$ is given by Girsanov's theorem.\n\nThe SDE for $Y_t$ is $dY_t = b(Y_t)dt + \\sigma dB_t + \\sigma \\beta_t dt$. We can write this as $dY_t = b(Y_t)dt + \\sigma(dB_t + \\beta_t dt)$. Girsanov's theorem states that if we define a new measure $\\mathbb{Q}$ under which $dW_t = dB_t + \\beta_t dt$ is a Brownian motion, then under $\\mathbb{Q}$, the process $Y_t$ satisfies $dY_t = b(Y_t)dt + \\sigma dW_t$. Thus, the law of $Y_t$ under $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\mu_y$.\n\nThe relative entropy between the path measures on the underlying probability space, $\\mathrm{H}(\\mathbb{P}\\|\\mathbb{Q})$, is given by:\n$$\n\\mathrm{H}(\\mathbb{P}\\|\\mathbb{Q}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P}}\\left[\\int_0^\\infty |\\beta_t|^2 dt\\right]\n$$\nBy the data processing inequality for relative entropy, $\\mathrm{H}(\\mathbb{P}^Y \\| \\mu_y) \\le \\mathrm{H}(\\mathbb{P}\\|\\mathbb{Q})$. The quantity on the right is the information-theoretic cost of control, and we will compute its upper bound.\n$$\n\\text{Cost} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^\\infty |\\beta_t|^2 dt\\right] = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^\\infty \\left|\\frac{\\lambda-m}{\\sigma} Z_t\\right|^2 dt\\right] = \\frac{(\\lambda-m)^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\int_0^\\infty \\mathbb{E}\\left[|Z_t|^2\\right] dt\n$$\nWe use the pathwise bound $|Z_t|^2 \\le |Z_0|^2 \\exp(-2\\lambda t) = |x-y|^2 \\exp(-2\\lambda t)$. This provides an upper bound for the cost, which we denote as $H_{bound}$:\n$$\nH_{bound} = \\frac{(\\lambda-m)^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\int_0^\\infty |x-y|^2 \\exp(-2\\lambda t) dt\n$$\n$$\nH_{bound} = \\frac{(\\lambda-m)^2 |x-y|^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-2\\lambda t) dt\n$$\nThe integral is elementary:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-2\\lambda t) dt = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{2\\lambda} \\exp(-2\\lambda t) \\right]_0^\\infty = 0 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\lambda}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\lambda}\n$$\nSubstituting this back, we obtain the final expression for the upper bound on the relative entropy:\n$$\nH_{bound} = \\frac{(\\lambda-m)^2 |x-y|^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2\\lambda} = \\frac{(\\lambda-m)^2 |x-y|^2}{4\\lambda\\sigma^2}\n$$\nThis quantity is the requested upper bound, expressed solely in terms of the given parameters $\\lambda, m, \\sigma,$ and the initial separation $|x-y|$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{(\\lambda-m)^{2} |x-y|^{2}}{4\\lambda\\sigma^{2}}}$$", "id": "2972472"}]}
