The concepts of an infinitesimal generator, Itô calculus, and drift conditions are standard and well-established.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly stated. The assumptions on the drift $b$ (locally Lipschitz, linear growth) are standard for guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of a strong solution to the SDE. The candidate function $V(x)$ is a common choice for analyzing stability. The tasks are specific and lead to a unique set of results based on the conditions imposed.\n- **Objective:** The problem is expressed in precise mathematical language, free from any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the invalidity flaws. It is a standard, formal, and solvable problem in stochastic analysis.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for three distinct but related results: the expression for the infinitesimal generator $L$ applied to the function $V(x)$, the conditions on the SDE's parameters for a specific drift inequality to hold, and the tight constants in that inequality.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for $LV(x)$. The infinitesimal generator $L$ of the Itô diffusion $dX_{t} = b(X_{t})\\,dt + \\sigma(X_t)\\, dW_{t}$ applied to a twice continuously differentiable function $f:\\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is given by:\n$$L f(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^n b_i(x) \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}(x) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j=1}^n (\\sigma(x)\\sigma(x)^T)_{ij} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j}(x)$$\nIn our case, the diffusion term is a constant matrix $\\sigma(x) = \\Sigma$. The candidate function is $V(x) = 1 + |x|^2 = 1 + \\sum_{k=1}^n x_k^2$. We need to compute the first and second partial derivatives of $V(x)$.\n\nThe first partial derivatives are:\n$$\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x_i} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} \\left(1 + \\sum_{k=1}^n x_k^2\\right) = 2x_i$$\nIn vector form, the gradient is $\\nabla V(x) = 2x$.\n\nThe second partial derivatives are:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} (2x_i) = 2\\delta_{ij}$$\nwhere $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. The Hessian matrix of $V(x)$ is $H_V(x) = 2I_n$, where $I_n$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix.\n\nNow we can write the generator $L$ in a more compact vector notation:\n$$LV(x) = \\langle \\nabla V(x), b(x) \\rangle + \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\left(\\Sigma\\Sigma^T H_V(x)\\right)$$\nSubstituting the gradient and Hessian of $V(x)$:\n$$LV(x) = \\langle 2x, b(x) \\rangle + \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\left(\\Sigma\\Sigma^T (2I_n)\\right)$$\nUsing the linearity of the trace and inner product, we simplify this expression:\n$$LV(x) = 2\\langle x, b(x) \\rangle + \\text{Tr}\\left(\\Sigma\\Sigma^T\\right)$$\nThe term $\\text{Tr}(\\Sigma\\Sigma^T)$ is the squared Frobenius norm of $\\Sigma$, sometimes denoted as $||\\Sigma||_F^2$. This is the first required result.\n\nNext, we must identify conditions on $b$ and $\\Sigma$ under which there exist constants $\\lambda  0$ and $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $LV(x) \\le -\\lambda|x|^2 + c$. Substituting our expression for $LV(x)$, this inequality becomes:\n$$2\\langle x, b(x) \\rangle + \\text{Tr}(\\Sigma\\Sigma^T) \\le -\\lambda|x|^2 + c$$\nFor this inequality to hold for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ with a positive $\\lambda$, the term $\\langle x, b(x) \\rangle$ must exert a dissipative effect, becoming sufficiently negative for large $|x|$. This motivates the following condition on the drift field $b$:\n**Condition on $b$**: There exist constants $K  0$ and $C \\in \\mathbb{R}$ (typically one can find $C \\ge 0$) such that for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, the following inequality holds:\n$$\\langle x, b(x) \\rangle \\le -K|x|^2 + C$$\nThis is a standard one-sided Lipschitz or dissipativity-type condition used in stability analysis. No specific condition on $\\Sigma$ is necessary beyond it being a constant matrix as given in the problem, since $\\text{Tr}(\\Sigma\\Sigma^T)$ is a finite non-negative constant.\n\nFinally, we determine the tight values of $\\lambda$ and $c$ based on this condition. We substitute the bound on $\\langle x, b(x) \\rangle$ into the expression for $LV(x)$:\n$$LV(x) = 2\\langle x, b(x) \\rangle + \\text{Tr}(\\Sigma\\Sigma^T) \\le 2(-K|x|^2 + C) + \\text{Tr}(\\Sigma\\Sigma^T)$$\n$$LV(x) \\le -2K|x|^2 + 2C + \\text{Tr}(\\Sigma\\Sigma^T)$$\nThis inequality is now in the desired form $LV(x) \\le -\\lambda|x|^2 + c$. By direct comparison, we identify the constants:\n$$\\lambda = 2K$$\n$$c = 2C + \\text{Tr}(\\Sigma\\Sigma^T)$$\nSince we required $K  0$, it follows that $\\lambda  0$, as needed. These values are \"tight\" in the sense that they are the sharpest conclusion that can be drawn from the assumed condition on $b$. If the inequality $\\langle x, b(x) \\rangle \\le -K|x|^2 + C$ is an equality for some $x$, then the inequality for $LV(x)$ is also an equality for that $x$. The constants $\\lambda$ and $c$ are expressed in terms of the quantitative bounds $K$ and $C$ from our condition on $b$ and the matrix $\\Sigma$ via its trace, as requested.\n\nThe three required components for the final answer are:\n1. $LV(x) = 2\\langle x, b(x) \\rangle + \\text{Tr}(\\Sigma\\Sigma^T)$\n2. $\\lambda = 2K$\n3. $c = 2C + \\text{Tr}(\\Sigma\\Sigma^T)$\n\nwhere $K  0$ and $C \\in \\mathbb{R}$ are the constants from the imposed condition on $b(x)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2\\langle x, b(x) \\rangle + \\text{Tr}(\\Sigma\\Sigma^T)  2K  2C + \\text{Tr}(\\Sigma\\Sigma^T) \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2997894"}, {"introduction": "We now move from general principles to a specific, famous case study: the geometric Brownian motion model.

It is a well-posed and scientifically grounded question in the field of stochastic differential equations, specifically concerning the stability analysis of geometric Brownian motion.

This equation describes a process known as geometric Brownian motion.\n\nThe infinitesimal generator $L$ of a one-dimensional Itô diffusion $dX_{t} = f(X_{t})dt + g(X_{t})dW_{t}$, when applied to a twice continuously differentiable function $V(x)$, is defined as:\n$$LV(x) = f(x)\\frac{dV}{dx} + \\frac{1}{2}g(x)^{2}\\frac{d^{2}V}{dx^{2}}$$\nFor the given SDE, we have the drift coefficient $f(x) = ax$ and the diffusion coefficient $g(x) = \\sigma x$.

The Almost Sure (Sample) Lyapunov Exponent**\n\nThe sample Lyapunov exponent is defined as the almost sure limit $\\lambda = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{t}\\ln|X_{t}|$. Since $X_{0}  0$, the solution $X_{t}$ will remain positive for all $t \\ge 0$ almost surely, so we can replace $|X_{t}|$ with $X_{t}$. To find the explicit solution for $X_{t}$, we apply Itô's formula to the function $V(x) = \\ln(x)$. The derivatives are $\\frac{dV}{dx} = \\frac{1}{x}$ and $\\frac{d^{2}V}{dx^{2}} = -\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$.\n\nAccording to Itô's formula, the differential of $Y_{t} = \\ln(X_{t})$ is given by:\n$$dY_{t} = d(\\ln X_{t}) = L(\\ln X_{t}) dt + \\frac{d(\\ln X_{t})}{dX_{t}} g(X_{t}) dW_{t}$$\nLet's compute the drift term using the generator:\n$$L(\\ln x) = (ax)\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}(\\sigma x)^{2}\\left(-\\frac{1}{x^{2}}\\right) = a - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}$$\nThe diffusion term for $d(\\ln X_{t})$ is:\n$$\\frac{d(\\ln X_{t})}{dX_{t}} g(X_{t}) dW_{t} = \\left(\\frac{1}{X_{t}}\\right)(\\sigma X_{t}) dW_{t} = \\sigma dW_{t}$$\nCombining these, we obtain the SDE for $Y_{t} = \\ln(X_{t})$:\n$$d(\\ln X_{t}) = \\left(a - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}\\right)dt + \\sigma dW_{t}$$\nIntegrating this from $t=0$ to $t$ yields:\n$$\\ln(X_{t}) - \\ln(X_{0}) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\left(a - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}\\right) ds + \\int_{0}^{t} \\sigma dW_{s}$$\n$$\\ln(X_{t}) = \\ln(X_{0}) + \\left(a - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}\\right)t + \\sigma W_{t}$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the explicit solution for $X_{t}$:\n$$X_{t} = X_{0} \\exp\\left(\\left(a - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}\\right)t + \\sigma W_{t}\\right)$$\nNow we can compute the sample Lyapunov exponent:\n$$\\lambda = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{t}\\ln(X_{t}) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{t}\\left[\\ln(X_{0}) + \\left(a - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}\\right)t + \\sigma W_{t}\\right]$$\n$$\\lambda = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left(\\frac{\\ln(X_{0})}{t} + a - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2} + \\sigma \\frac{W_{t}}{t}\\right)$$\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{\\ln(X_{0})}{t}$ goes to $0$.

The Mean-Square Lyapunov Exponent**\n\nThe mean-square Lyapunov exponent is the exponential rate of change of the second moment, $\\mathbb{E}[X_{t}^{2}]$. We are instructed to use the candidate Lyapunov function $V(x) = x^{2}$. We first compute the action of the generator $L$ on $V(x)$. The derivatives are $\\frac{dV}{dx} = 2x$ and $\\frac{d^{2}V}{dx^{2}} = 2$.\n$$LV(x) = L(x^{2}) = (ax)(2x) + \\frac{1}{2}(\\sigma x)^{2}(2) = 2ax^{2} + \\sigma^{2}x^{2} = (2a + \\sigma^{2})x^{2}$$\nNotice that $LV(x) = (2a + \\sigma^{2})V(x)$.\n\nBy Dynkin's formula, the time derivative of the expectation of $V(X_t)$ is given by:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}\\mathbb{E}[V(X_{t})] = \\mathbb{E}[LV(X_{t})]$$\nSubstituting $V(x)=x^2$ and the expression for $LV(x)$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}\\mathbb{E}[X_{t}^{2}] = \\mathbb{E}[(2a + \\sigma^{2})X_{t}^{2}] = (2a + \\sigma^{2})\\mathbb{E}[X_{t}^{2}]$$\nLet $m_{2}(t) = \\mathbb{E}[X_{t}^{2}]$. We have the ordinary differential equation:\n$$\\frac{d m_{2}(t)}{dt} = (2a + \\sigma^{2})m_{2}(t)$$\nThe solution to this ODE is:\n$$m_{2}(t) = m_{2}(0) \\exp\\left((2a + \\sigma^{2})t\\right)$$\nwhere $m_{2}(0) = \\mathbb{E}[X_{0}^{2}]$. Thus,\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X_{t}^{2}] = \\mathbb{E}[X_{0}^{2}] \\exp\\left((2a + \\sigma^{2})t\\right)$$\nThe exponential rate of growth or decay of the second moment is the coefficient in the exponent. The mean-square Lyapunov exponent is therefore:\n$$2a + \\sigma^{2}$$\n\n**3. The Extinction Probability**\n\nWe need to find the probability that $X_{t}$ converges to the equilibrium at $0$ as $t \\to \\infty$, given $X_{0}  0$. We analyze the long-term behavior of the explicit solution:\n$$X_{t} = X_{0} \\exp\\left(\\left(a - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}\\right)t + \\sigma W_{t}\\right)$$\nThe asymptotic behavior of $X_t$ is determined by the behavior of the argument of the exponential function, which can be written as $t\\left(a - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2} + \\sigma \\frac{W_{t}}{t}\\right)$. As established before, $\\frac{W_{t}}{t} \\to 0$ almost surely as $t \\to \\infty$. Therefore, the sign of the entire argument for large $t$ is determined by the sign of the sample Lyapunov exponent $\\lambda = a - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}$.\n\nCase 1: $a - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}  0$.\nIn this case, the term $\\left(a - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}\\right)t$ goes to $-\\infty$, and it dominates the term $\\sigma W_{t}$. Thus, the argument of the exponent goes to $-\\infty$ almost surely.\n$$\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} X_{t} = X_{0} \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\exp\\left(\\left(a - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}\\right)t + \\sigma W_{t}\\right) = 0 \\quad \\text{a.s.}$$\nThe probability of extinction is $1$.\n\nCase 2: $a - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}  0$.\nIn this case, the term $\\left(a - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}\\right)t$ goes to $+\\infty$ and dominates the term $\\sigma W_{t}$. The argument of the exponent goes to $+\\infty$ almost surely.\n$$\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} X_{t} = +\\infty \\quad \\text{a.s.}$$\nThe probability of extinction is $0$.\n\nCase 3: $a - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2} = 0$.\nThe solution simplifies to $X_{t} = X_{0} \\exp(\\sigma W_{t})$. The standard Wiener process $W_{t}$ does not converge as $t \\to \\infty$. By the law of the iterated logarithm, $\\limsup_{t \\to \\infty} W_{t} = +\\infty$ and $\\liminf_{t \\to \\infty} W_{t} = -\\infty$ almost surely (for $\\sigma \\neq 0$). Consequently, $\\limsup_{t \\to \\infty} X_{t} = +\\infty$ and $\\liminf_{t \\to \\infty} X_{t} = 0$ almost surely. The process does not converge to $0$. If $\\sigma=0$, then $a=0$, so $dX_t=0$, meaning $X_t=X_00$ for all $t$, which also does not converge to $0$. In this case, the probability of extinction is $0$.\n\nCombining these results, the extinction probability $P_{ext} = \\mathbb{P}(\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} X_t = 0 \\mid X_0  0)$ is:\n$$P_{ext} = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if } a - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}  0 \\\\ 0  \\text{if } a - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2} \\ge 0 \\end{cases}$$\n\nThe three requested quantities are the sample Lyapunov exponent $a - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}$, the mean-square Lyapunov exponent $2a + \\sigma^{2}$, and the extinction probability defined above.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}  2a + \\sigma^{2}  \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if } a - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}  0 \\\\ 0  \\text{if } a - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2} \\ge 0 \\end{cases}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2997960"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice introduces a more advanced and powerful technique for proving convergence: the stochastic LaSalle invariance principle.

For $x = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{2}}$:\n    $b\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = -\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^{3} = -\\frac{\\sigma^{3}}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\neq 0$ (since $\\sigma  0$).\n    $g\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = \\sigma\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\neq 0$ (since $\\sigma  0$).\n    Since neither the drift nor the diffusion is zero, a process starting at this point will not remain there. Thus, the set $\\{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{2}}\\}$ is not invariant.\n\n3.  For $x = -\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{2}}$:\n    $b\\left(-\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = -\\left(-\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^{3} = \\frac{\\sigma^{3}}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\neq 0$.\n    $g\\left(-\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = \\sigma\\left(-\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = -\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\neq 0$.\n    Similarly, the process will not remain at this point. The set $\\{-\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{2}}\\}$ is not invariant.\n\nThe set $E$ is a discrete set of points. Since the sample paths of $X_t$ are continuous, a trajectory cannot jump between these discrete points. Therefore, any invariant subset of $E$ must be a union of singleton invariant sets. As we have shown, the only singleton invariant set is $\\{0\\}$. Consequently, the largest invariant subset of $E$ is $\\{0\\}$.\n\n**Step 3: Use a stochastic LaSalle argument to determine the almost sure limit of $X_t$ as $t\\to\\infty$**\n\nThe stochastic LaSalle invariance principle can be applied. For the chosen Lyapunov function $V(x) = x^2$, we have $V(x) \\ge 0$ and $V(x) \\to \\infty$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$. The infinitesimal generator $LV(x) = -2x^4 + \\sigma^2 x^2$ is negative for large $|x|$. Specifically, $LV(x)  0$ for $|x|  \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{2}}$. This coercive property ensures that the solution $X_t$ is stochastically bounded and does not escape to infinity. These are sufficient conditions for the application of the stochastic LaSalle invariance principle.\n\nThe principle states that the solution $X_t$ converges almost surely to the largest invariant subset of $E = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} : L V(x) = 0\\}$. From Step 2, we identified this largest invariant subset to be $\\{0\\}$.\nTherefore, we can conclude that as $t \\to \\infty$, the state $X_t$ converges to $0$ almost surely.\n$$\n\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} X_{t} = 0 \\quad \\text{a.s.}\n$$\nThe value of this limit is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2997920"}]}
