All definitions are standard and the tasks are mathematically sound.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Expression for $[W^{\\delta}]_{t}$\n\nThe problem defines the mesh-based quadratic variation of the polygonal approximation $W^{\\delta}$ as\n$$\n[W^{\\delta}]_{t} \\;=\\; \\sum_{k=0}^{N_{t}^{\\delta}-1} \\Big(W^{\\delta}_{t_{k+1}}-W^{\\delta}_{t_{k}}\\Big)^{2}\n$$\nwhere $t_k = k\\delta$ are the points of the partition $\\mathcal{P}_{\\delta}$ and $N_{t}^{\\delta}=\\lfloor t/\\delta \\rfloor$. By construction, the polygonal interpolation $W^{\\delta}_{t}$ matches the original Brownian motion $W_{t}$ at the partition points $t_k$. Therefore, the increment of the polygonal approximation between two consecutive partition points is identical to the increment of the Brownian motion itself:\n$$\nW^{\\delta}_{t_{k+1}}-W^{\\delta}_{t_{k}} \\;=\\; W_{t_{k+1}}-W_{t_{k}}\n$$\nThe problem denotes this increment as $\\Delta W_{k}$. Substituting this into the definition of $[W^{\\delta}]_{t}$, we obtain:\n$$\n[W^{\\delta}]_{t} \\;=\\; \\sum_{k=0}^{N_{t}^{\\delta}-1} (W_{t_{k+1}}-W_{t_{k}})^{2} \\;=\\; \\sum_{k=0}^{N_{t}^{\\delta}-1} (\\Delta W_{k})^{2}\n$$\n\nPart 2: Convergence Proof\n\nLet $S_{t}^{\\delta} = [W^{\\delta}]_{t} = \\sum_{k=0}^{N_{t}^{\\delta}-1} (\\Delta W_{k})^{2}$. We are given that Brownian motion has stationary, independent, Gaussian increments. The increment $\\Delta W_{k} = W_{t_{k+1}}-W_{t_{k}}$ over a time interval of duration $\\delta$ is a normal random variable $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\delta)$. We can write $\\Delta W_k = \\sqrt{\\delta}Z_k$, where $\\{Z_k\\}$ are i.i.d. standard normal variables.\nThus, $S_{t}^{\\delta}$ can be rewritten as:\n$$\nS_{t}^{\\delta} \\;=\\; \\sum_{k=0}^{N_{t}^{\\delta}-1} (\\sqrt{\\delta} Z_k)^2 \\;=\\; \\delta \\sum_{k=0}^{N_{t}^{\\delta}-1} Z_k^2\n$$\nThe expectation of $S_{t}^{\\delta}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[S_{t}^{\\delta}] \\;=\\; \\delta \\sum_{k=0}^{N_{t}^{\\delta}-1} \\mathbb{E}[Z_k^2] \\;=\\; \\delta \\cdot N_{t}^{\\delta} \\cdot 1 \\;=\\; \\delta N_{t}^{\\delta}\n$$\nSince $N_{t}^{\\delta} = \\lfloor t/\\delta \\rfloor$, we know $t-\\delta < \\delta N_{t}^{\\delta} \\le t$. As $\\delta \\to 0$, we conclude that $\\lim_{\\delta \\to 0} \\mathbb{E}[S_{t}^{\\delta}] = t$.\n\nTo prove convergence in probability, we show convergence in $L^2$, which requires showing $\\mathbb{E}[(S_{t}^{\\delta} - t)^2] \\to 0$. The mean squared error is $\\operatorname{Var}(S_{t}^{\\delta}) + (\\mathbb{E}[S_{t}^{\\delta}]-t)^2$. The second term goes to zero. For the variance:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(S_{t}^{\\delta}) \\;=\\; \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\delta \\sum_{k=0}^{N_{t}^{\\delta}-1} Z_k^2\\right) \\;=\\; \\delta^2 \\sum_{k=0}^{N_{t}^{\\delta}-1} \\operatorname{Var}(Z_k^2)\n$$\nFor a standard normal variable, $\\operatorname{Var}(Z_k^2) = \\mathbb{E}[Z_k^4] - (\\mathbb{E}[Z_k^2])^2 = 3 - 1^2 = 2$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(S_{t}^{\\delta}) \\;=\\; \\delta^2 \\cdot N_{t}^{\\delta} \\cdot 2 \\le 2\\delta^2 (t/\\delta) = 2t\\delta.\n$$\nAs $\\delta \\to 0$, $\\operatorname{Var}(S_{t}^{\\delta}) \\to 0$. Since both the bias squared and the variance go to zero, $S_{t}^{\\delta} \\to t$ in $L^2$, and therefore in probability.\n\nFor almost sure convergence along the dyadic sequence $\\delta_n = 2^{-n}$, we let $S_n = S_t^{\\delta_n}$. By the Borel-Cantelli lemma and Chebyshev's inequality, since $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{P}(|S_n - \\mathbb{E}[S_n]| > \\epsilon) \\le \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\operatorname{Var}(S_n)}{\\epsilon^2} \\le \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2t \\cdot 2^{-n}}{\\epsilon^2}$ is a convergent series, $S_n - \\mathbb{E}[S_n] \\to 0$ almost surely. Since $\\mathbb{E}[S_n] \\to t$, we conclude that $S_n \\to t$ almost surely.\n\nPart 3: Connection to the Wong-Zakai theorem\n\nThe Wong-Zakai theorem addresses the limit of solutions to ODEs driven by smooth approximations of white noise. For any finite $\\delta > 0$, the ODE $dy^{\\delta}_{t} = f(y^{\\delta}_{t}) dW^{\\delta}_{t}$ obeys the classical chain rule. This relies on the fact that for smooth functions, the quadratic variation is zero, meaning terms like $(dW^{\\delta}_{t})^2$ vanish faster than $dt$.\n\nHowever, as we proved, the quadratic variation of the Brownian approximation does not vanish in the limit: $[W^{\\delta}]_t \\to t$. The limiting process $W_t$ has a non-zero quadratic variation, heuristically $(dW_t)^2=dt$. This property invalidates classical calculus and necessitates a special stochastic calculus.\n\nThe Stratonovich integral is defined in a way that preserves the classical chain rule. Since the pre-limit ODEs obey ordinary calculus, it is natural that their solutions converge to the solution of a Stratonovich SDE, $dY_t = f(Y_t) \\circ dW_t$. The calculus of the approximation is preserved in the limit. In contrast, the Itō calculus has a modified chain rule (Itō's lemma) that explicitly includes a term related to the non-zero quadratic variation. Thus, the result $[W^{\\delta}]_t \\to t$ is the fundamental reason the limiting SDE is interpreted in the Stratonovich sense.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{t}$$", "id": "3004534"}, {"introduction": "The Wong-Zakai theorem states that ODEs driven by smooth approximations of white noise converge to Stratonovich SDEs.
