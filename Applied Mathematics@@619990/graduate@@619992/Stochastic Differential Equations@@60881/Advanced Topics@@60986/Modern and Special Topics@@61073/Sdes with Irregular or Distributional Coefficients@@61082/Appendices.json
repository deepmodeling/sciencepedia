This represents the canonical decomposition of the semimartingale $X_t$ into its initial value $X_0$, a continuous local martingale part $M_t = W_t$, and a continuous finite variation part $A_t = \\beta L_t^{0}(X)$.\n\nThe quadratic variation of $X_t$ is given by:\n$$\n\\langle X, X \\rangle_t = \\langle X_0 + W + \\beta L^{0}(X), X_0 + W + \\beta L^{0}(X) \\rangle_t\n$$\nAssuming $X_0$ is a constant or $\\mathcal{F}_0$-measurable, its quadratic variation is $0$. The quadratic variation of a continuous finite variation process is zero, so $\\langle \\beta L^{0}(X), \\beta L^{0}(X) \\rangle_t = 0$. The cross-variation of a continuous local martingale with a continuous finite variation process is also zero, so $\\langle W, \\beta L^{0}(X) \\rangle_t = 0$. Therefore, the quadratic variation of $X_t$ is solely determined by its local martingale part:\n$$\n\\langle X, X \\rangle_t = \\langle W, W \\rangle_t = t\n$$\nThis implies that the differential of the quadratic variation is $d\\langle X, X \\rangle_s = ds$.\n\nSubstituting $dX_s$ and $d\\langle X, X \\rangle_s$ into Itô's formula, we obtain:\n$$\n\\varphi(X_t) = \\varphi(X_0) + \\int_{0}^{t} \\varphi'(X_s) (dW_s + \\beta \\, dL_s^{0}(X)) + \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{t} \\varphi''(X_s) \\, ds\n$$\nWe can split the stochastic integral into two parts:\n$$\n\\varphi(X_t) = \\varphi(X_0) + \\int_{0}^{t} \\varphi'(X_s) \\, dW_s + \\beta \\int_{0}^{t} \\varphi'(X_s) \\, dL_s^{0}(X) + \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{t} \\varphi''(X_s) \\, ds\n$$\nThe integral with respect to the local time, $\\int_{0}^{t} \\varphi'(X_s) \\, dL_s^{0}(X)$, is a Stieltjes integral.

This term represents the singular drift at the origin. Its meaning is that the process $X_t$ experiences a \"push\" or \"pull\" of magnitude proportional to $\\beta$ only when it is at the position $x=0$. The cumulative effect of this singular drift up to time $t$ is $\\beta \\varphi'(0) L_t^0(X)$, where the local time $L_t^0(X)$ measures the total \"time\" the process has spent at the origin, appropriately scaled. The occupation density formula provides the link, showing that the local time at $0$ acts as the scaling factor for any force or cost concentrated at that single point.\n\nFinally, we compute the predictable quadratic variation of the local martingale part. The problem phrasing identifies the local martingale as $M_t = \\varphi(X_t) - \\varphi(X_0) - \\int_{0}^{t} L\\varphi(X_s) \\, ds$.

The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and uses standard, albeit advanced, concepts from stochastic calculus.\n\nWe will address the three parts of the problem in sequence.\n\n### Part 1: Weak Solution and Non-Existence of a Strong Solution\n\nThe given Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) is\n$$\ndX_{t} = \\operatorname{sgn}(X_{t})\\, dW_{t}, \\qquad X_{0}=0,\n$$\nwhere $\\operatorname{sgn}(x)=\\mathbf{1}_{\\{x0\\}}-\\mathbf{1}_{\\{x0\\}}$.\n\n**Construction of a Weak Solution**\nA weak solution is a pair of processes $(X, W)$ on some filtered probability space $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, (\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\geq 0}, \\mathbb{P})$ such that $W$ is a standard $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$-Brownian motion, $X$ is an $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$-adapted continuous process, and the SDE is satisfied.\n\nLet $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, (\\mathcal{G}_t)_{t\\geq 0}, \\mathbb{P})$ be a filtered probability space supporting a standard one-dimensional $(\\mathcal{G}_t)$-Brownian motion $(B_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ with $B_0=0$. We propose a candidate solution by setting $X_t = B_t$ for all $t \\ge 0$. We must show that there exists a Brownian motion $W_t$ such that the SDE is satisfied. Let us define a process $W_t$ by the stochastic integral:\n$$\nW_t := \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(X_s) dX_s = \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(B_s) dB_s.\n$$\nFor this construction to constitute a weak solution, we must verify that $(W_t)_{t\\geq 0}$ is a standard Brownian motion. We use Lévy's characterization theorem for Brownian motion, which states that a continuous local martingale $M_t$ with $M_0=0$ is a standard Brownian motion if and only if its quadratic variation is $\\langle M \\rangle_t = t$.\n\nThe process $W_t$ is a stochastic integral with respect to a Brownian motion, so it is a continuous local martingale with $W_0=0$. Its quadratic variation is given by:\n$$\n\\langle W \\rangle_t = \\left\\langle \\int \\operatorname{sgn}(B) dB, \\int \\operatorname{sgn}(B) dB \\right\\rangle_t = \\int_0^t (\\operatorname{sgn}(B_s))^2 d\\langle B \\rangle_s.\n$$\nThe quadratic variation of a standard Brownian motion is $\\langle B \\rangle_t = t$. The sign function squared is $(\\operatorname{sgn}(x))^2 = 1$ for $x \\neq 0$ and $(\\operatorname{sgn}(0))^2 = 0$. The set of times $\\{s \\in [0, t] : B_s = 0\\}$ has Lebesgue measure zero almost surely. Therefore, $(\\operatorname{sgn}(B_s))^2 = 1$ for almost every $s \\in [0,t]$.\nThis gives:\n$$\n\\langle W \\rangle_t = \\int_0^t 1 \\cdot ds = t.\n$$\nBy Lévy's characterization, $W_t$ is a standard Brownian motion. We have constructed a pair $(X_t, W_t) = (B_t, \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(B_s)dB_s)$ on the filtration of $B_t$ that satisfies the SDE, thus proving the existence of a weak solution. Note that the law of this solution $X_t$ is simply the law of a standard Brownian motion.\n\n**Non-Existence of a Strong Solution**\nA strong solution is a process $X_t$ adapted to the filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_t^W)_{t \\geq 0}$ generated by the *given* Brownian motion $W_t$.\n\nFirst, we establish a key property of any solution. For any continuous local martingale $X_t$ starting at $X_0=0$, its quadratic variation is $d\\langle X \\rangle_t = (\\operatorname{sgn}(X_t))^2 (dW_t)^2 = (\\operatorname{sgn}(X_t))^2 dt$. Since the zero set of $X_t$ (if it is not identically zero) must have Lebesgue measure zero, we have $\\langle X \\rangle_t = t$. By Lévy's characterization, any non-trivial solution $X_t$ must be a Brownian motion.\n\nLet's assume a strong solution $X_t$ exists. It must be a Brownian motion adapted to the filtration $\\mathcal{F}_t^W$.\nBy Tanaka's formula for the function $f(x)=|x|$ applied to the semimartingale $X_t$:\n$$\n|X_t| - |X_0| = \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(X_s) dX_s + L_t^0(X),\n$$\nwhere $L_t^0(X)$ is the semimartingale local time of $X$ at $0$.\nSubstituting $X_0=0$ and the SDE $dX_s = \\operatorname{sgn}(X_s)dW_s$, we get:\n$$\n|X_t| = \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(X_s)(\\operatorname{sgn}(X_s)dW_s) + L_t^0(X) = \\int_0^t (\\operatorname{sgn}(X_s))^2 dW_s + L_t^0(X).\n$$\nAs established before, $(\\operatorname{sgn}(X_s))^2=1$ for a.e. $s$. Thus, the integral becomes:\n$$\n|X_t| = \\int_0^t dW_s + L_t^0(X) = W_t + L_t^0(X).\n$$\nThis equation describes a Skorokhod problem for $|X_t|$ driven by $W_t$. The conditions are that $|X_t| \\ge 0$ and $L_t^0(X)$ is a non-decreasing process that increases only when $|X_t|=0$. This problem has a unique solution for a given $W_t$:\n$$\nL_t^0(X) = \\sup_{0 \\le s \\le t}(-W_s) \\lor 0 = -\\inf_{0 \\le s \\le t} W_s \\quad (\\text{since } W_0=0),\n$$\nand consequently,\n$$\n|X_t| = W_t - \\inf_{0 \\le s \\le t} W_s = \\sup_{0 \\le s \\le t}(W_t - W_s).\n$$\nThis shows that if a strong solution $X_t$ exists, its absolute value $|X_t|$ is uniquely determined by the path of $W_t$ and is therefore adapted to $\\mathcal{F}_t^W$. The process $|X_t|$ is a reflected Brownian motion.\n\nHowever, a strong solution $X_t$ must be fully determined by $W_t$. We know $X_t = \\operatorname{sgn}(X_t)|X_t|$. While $|X_t|$ is determined, the sign process $\\operatorname{sgn}(X_t)$ is not. The behavior of $X_t$ is described by excursions away from zero. Let $(l_i, r_i)$ be the $i$-th excursion interval of $|X_t|$ from zero. The sign of $X_t$ during this excursion, let's call it $\\epsilon_i$, can be either $+1$ or $-1$. The dynamics of the SDE are symmetric, meaning that if $X_t$ is a solution, so is $-X_t$. There is nothing in the information provided by $W_t$ to determine the sign $\\epsilon_i$ of any given excursion. To construct a full path for $X_t$, one needs to provide an infinite sequence of signs $\\{\\epsilon_i\\}_{i \\ge 1}$, which corresponds to choosing the sign of each excursion. This sequence must be a sequence of i.i.d. Rademacher random variables, independent of $|X_t|$ (and thus independent of $W_t$). This sequence represents \"extra randomness\" not contained in the filtration $\\mathcal{F}_t^W$. Since $X_t$ depends on this external randomness, it cannot be adapted to $\\mathcal{F}_t^W$. Therefore, no strong solution exists. The non-uniqueness of the stochastic basis refers to the fact that a solution can be constructed, but only on an enlarged filtration $\\mathcal{F}_t^W \\lor \\sigma(\\{\\epsilon_i\\})$.\n\n### Part 2: Characteristic Function of $X_t$\n\nWe seek to compute $\\varphi_t(u) = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(iuX_t)]$ for a fixed $t0$ and $u\\in\\mathbb{R}$.\nAs shown in Part 1, any weak solution $X_t$ to the SDE, starting from $X_0=0$, must have a quadratic variation $\\langle X \\rangle_t = t$. Since $X_t$ is a continuous local martingale, Lévy's characterization implies that $X_t$ is a standard Brownian motion.\nA standard Brownian motion $B_t$ at a fixed time $t$ follows a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $t$, i.e., $B_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,t)$.\nTherefore, $X_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,t)$.\nThe characteristic function of a random variable $Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ is given by $\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(iuY)] = \\exp(iu\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}u^2\\sigma^2)$.\nFor $X_t$, we have $\\mu=0$ and $\\sigma^2=t$. Hence, its characteristic function is:\n$$\n\\varphi_t(u) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}u^2t\\right).\n$$\nAlternatively, we can derive this result directly using Itô's formula, without first identifying the law of $X_t$. Let $f(x) = \\exp(iux)$. Its derivatives are $f'(x) = iu\\exp(iux)$ and $f''(x) = -u^2\\exp(iux)$. Applying Itô's formula to $f(X_t)$:\n$$\nd(\\exp(iuX_t)) = f'(X_t)dX_t + \\frac{1}{2}f''(X_t)d\\langle X \\rangle_t.\n$$\nSubstituting $dX_t = \\operatorname{sgn}(X_t) dW_t$ and $d\\langle X\\rangle_t = dt$:\n$$\nd(\\exp(iuX_t)) = iu\\exp(iuX_t)\\operatorname{sgn}(X_t)dW_t - \\frac{1}{2}u^2\\exp(iuX_t)dt.\n$$\nIntegrating from $s=0$ to $s=t$ and taking expectations:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(iuX_t)] - \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(iuX_0)] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[iu \\int_0^t \\exp(iuX_s)\\operatorname{sgn}(X_s)dW_s\\right] - \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{u^2}{2}\\int_0^t \\exp(iuX_s)ds\\right].\n$$\nSince $X_0=0$, $\\exp(iuX_0)=1$. The stochastic integral term has zero expectation because the integrand is bounded and thus the stochastic integral is a true martingale. Using Fubini's theorem on the last term:\n$$\n\\varphi_t(u) - 1 = 0 - \\frac{u^2}{2}\\int_0^t \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(iuX_s)]ds = -\\frac{u^2}{2}\\int_0^t \\varphi_s(u)ds.\n$$\nLetting $g(t) = \\varphi_t(u)$, we have the ordinary differential equation:\n$$\ng'(t) = -\\frac{u^2}{2}g(t), \\quad\\text{with initial condition } g(0)=\\varphi_0(u)=1.\n$$\nThe unique solution to this ODE is $g(t) = \\exp(-\\frac{u^2 t}{2})$.\n\n### Part 3: Perturbed SDE\n\nThe perturbed SDE is given by:\n$$\nd\\widetilde{X}_{t} = \\operatorname{sgn}(\\widetilde{X}_{t})\\, dW_{t} + \\beta \\, dL_{t}^{0}(\\widetilde{X}), \\qquad \\widetilde{X}_{0}=0, \\qquad \\beta\\in(-1,1).\n$$\nApplying Tanaka's formula to $|\\widetilde{X}_t|$:\n$$\n|\\widetilde{X}_t| = \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(\\widetilde{X}_s) d\\widetilde{X}_s + L_t^0(\\widetilde{X}).\n$$\nSubstituting the SDE for $d\\widetilde{X}_s$:\n$$\n|\\widetilde{X}_t| = \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(\\widetilde{X}_s) \\left( \\operatorname{sgn}(\\widetilde{X}_s)dW_s + \\beta dL_s^0(\\widetilde{X}) \\right) + L_t^0(\\widetilde{X}).\n$$\n$$\n|\\widetilde{X}_t| = \\int_0^t (\\operatorname{sgn}(\\widetilde{X}_s))^2 dW_s + \\beta \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(\\widetilde{X}_s) dL_s^0(\\widetilde{X}) + L_t^0(\\widetilde{X}).\n$$\nThe first integral is $W_t$. The local time $L_s^0(\\widetilde{X})$ increases only when $\\widetilde{X}_s=0$. By the given definition, $\\operatorname{sgn}(0)=0$. Therefore, the integrand $\\operatorname{sgn}(\\widetilde{X}_s)$ is zero whenever $dL_s^0(\\widetilde{X})$ is non-zero. The second integral is thus zero: $\\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(\\widetilde{X}_s) dL_s^0(\\widetilde{X})=0$.\nWe are left with:\n$$\n|\\widetilde{X}_t| = W_t + L_t^0(\\widetilde{X}).\n$$\nThis is the same relationship as in the unperturbed case. This means that for any solution $\\widetilde{X}_t$, its absolute value $|\\widetilde{X}_t|$ is the same reflected Brownian motion determined by $W_t$ as before.\n\nThe presence of the term $\\beta dL_t^0(\\widetilde{X})$, however, fundamentally alters the behavior of the process at zero. This term acts as a drift that is active only when the process is at the origin. It affects the choice of sign for the next excursion. Heuristically, when the process hits zero, it receives a \"push\" of size $\\beta$ for every unit of local time it accumulates there. If $\\beta0$, the push is positive, biasing the process towards positive excursions. If $\\beta0$, the push is negative.\nThis behavior is formalized in the theory of skew Brownian motion. The solution $\\widetilde{X}_t$ is a skew Brownian motion where the probability of an excursion starting from zero being positive is $p = \\frac{1+\\beta}{2}$. Since $\\beta \\in (-1,1)$, this probability $p$ is in $(0,1)$.\nFor $\\beta=0$, $p=1/2$, corresponding to the symmetric case where the sign of an excursion is decided by a fair coin flip.\nFor $\\beta \\neq 0$, $p \\neq 1/2$, and the coin is biased.\n\nThe failure of strong solvability stems from the need for external randomness to determine the signs of excursions, as this information is not contained in the filtration of $W_t$. The introduction of $\\beta \\neq 0$ \"further entrenches\" this failure for a deeper reason based on symmetry.\nThe driving process $W_t$ is a standard Brownian motion, a process whose properties are symmetric with respect to a sign change (i.e., the law of $W_t$ is the same as the law of $-W_t$).\nIn the case $\\beta=0$, the required external randomness is a sequence of fair coin flips, which is itself a symmetric random object. While it is not possible to construct these flips from $W_t$, one might not see an immediate contradiction based on symmetry alone.\nIn the case $\\beta\\neq0$, the problem becomes asymmetric. The required external randomness is a sequence of *biased* coin flips. This introduces a fundamental asymmetry into the solution's structure. It becomes conceptually even more apparent that a symmetric driving process like $W_t$ cannot, by itself, generate the necessary asymmetric outcomes (the biased flips). Any construction of $\\widetilde{X}_t$ purely from $W_t$ would have to respect the symmetries of $W_t$. Since the law of the solution is asymmetric for $\\beta\\neq 0$, it cannot be a measurable function of a symmetric object like $W_t$.
