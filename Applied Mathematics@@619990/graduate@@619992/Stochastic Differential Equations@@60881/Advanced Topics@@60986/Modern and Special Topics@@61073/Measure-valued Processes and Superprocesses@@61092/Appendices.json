Extract Givens**\n-   **Particle Dynamics**: Each particle moves as a one-dimensional standard Brownian motion (generator $\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta$).\n-   **Branching Mechanism**: Each particle branches independently at a rate of $N$. The offspring number is $0$ with probability $1/2$ and $2$ with probability $1/2$. This is a critical branching mechanism with reproduction variance $\\sigma^2 = \\mathbb{E}[(\\text{offspring}-1)^2] = \\frac{1}{2}(0-1)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(2-1)^2 = 1$.\n-   **Rescaled Measure-Valued Process**: The process $X^{(N)}_t$ is defined for test functions $\\varphi \\in C_c^2(\\mathbb{R})$ by:\n    $$\n    \\langle X^{(N)}_t, \\varphi \\rangle = m_N \\sum_{i=1}^{K(s_N t)} \\varphi\\left(\\frac{X_i(s_N t)}{r_N}\\right)\n    $$\n-   **Scaling Relations**: $s_N = N^a$ (time), $r_N = N^b$ (space), $m_N = N^c$ (mass).\n-   **Initial Condition**: The total rescaled initial mass is of order one, i.e., $m_N K(0) \\to M_0 \\in (0,\\infty)$ as $N \\to \\infty$. The initial particle locations are tight under the space scaling.\n-   **Target Limiting Process**: The limit $X_t$ as $N\\to\\infty$ must solve the martingale problem for super-Brownian motion with generator $\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta$ and branching parameter $1$.

Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Scaling Exponents\n\nLet $Z_t^{(N)} = \\langle X^{(N)}_t, \\varphi \\rangle$. We analyze the dynamics of this process to match them with the target martingale problem. Let $\\tau = s_N t$ be the physical time. The process is a sum over particles, so we consider the contribution of each particle's evolution. The change in $Z_t^{(N)}$ comes from two independent sources: the continuous motion of particles (Brownian motion) and the discrete jumps (branching events).\n\nWe analyze the process over an infinitesimal rescaled time interval $dt$, which corresponds to a physical time interval $d\\tau = s_N dt$.\n\n**2.1. Drift Term (from Brownian Motion)**\nFor a single particle $i$, its position $X_i(\\tau)$ follows a standard Brownian motion. Its generator is $\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}$. The scaled position is $x_i(\\tau) = X_i(\\tau)/r_N$. By the scaling properties of Brownian motion, the generator for $x_i(\\tau)$ is $\\frac{1}{2r_N^2}\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}$.\nApplying Itô's formula for the process without jumps, the drift of $\\varphi(x_i(\\tau))$ is $\\frac{1}{2r_N^2}\\Delta\\varphi(x_i(\\tau))$.\nSumming over all $K(\\tau)$ particles and multiplying by the mass $m_N$, the drift of $Z_t^{(N)}$ with respect to physical time $\\tau$ is:\n$$ \\frac{d}{d\\tau}\\mathbb{E}[Z_t^{(N)}] = m_N \\sum_{i=1}^{K(\\tau)} \\frac{1}{2r_N^2} \\Delta\\varphi\\left(\\frac{X_i(\\tau)}{r_N}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2r_N^2} \\langle X^{(N)}_t, \\Delta\\varphi \\rangle $$\nTo get the drift with respect to the rescaled time $t$, we multiply by $\\frac{d\\tau}{dt} = s_N$. The drift part of the generator for $Z_t^{(N)}$ is thus multiplication by $\\frac{s_N}{2r_N^2} \\langle X^{(N)}_t, \\Delta\\varphi \\rangle$.\nFor this to converge to the target drift $\\frac{1}{2} \\langle X_t, \\Delta\\varphi \\rangle$, we require the prefactor to converge to $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n$$ \\frac{s_N}{r_N^2} \\to 1 \\implies \\frac{N^a}{N^{2b}} = N^{a-2b} \\to 1 \\implies a - 2b = 0 \\quad (1) $$\n\n**2.2. Quadratic Variation Term (from Martingale Part)**\nThe martingale part of $Z_t^{(N)}$ has two components: one from the continuous diffusion of particles and one from the discrete branching jumps. These are independent.\n\n*   **Continuous Martingale Part**: The martingale part of $d\\varphi(x_i(\\tau))$ is $\\frac{1}{r_N}\\varphi'(x_i(\\tau)) dX_i(\\tau)$. The quadratic variation of the sum is:\n    $$ d[M^{cont}]_\\tau = \\sum_{i=1}^{K(\\tau)} \\left(m_N \\frac{1}{r_N} \\varphi'\\left(\\frac{X_i(\\tau)}{r_N}\\right)\\right)^2 d\\tau = \\frac{m_N^2}{r_N^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{K(\\tau)} \\left(\\varphi'\\right)^2 d\\tau $$\n    $$ d[M^{cont}]_\\tau = \\frac{m_N}{r_N^2} \\langle X_t^{(N)}, (\\varphi')^2 \\rangle d\\tau $$\n    In rescaled time $t$, this is $d[M^{cont}]_t = \\frac{m_N s_N}{r_N^2} \\langle X_t^{(N)}, (\\varphi')^2 \\rangle dt$. The target limiting process has no such term in its quadratic variation. Therefore, this term must vanish in the limit $N \\to \\infty$.\n    $$ \\frac{m_N s_N}{r_N^2} \\to 0 \\implies \\frac{N^c N^a}{N^{2b}} = N^{c+a-2b} \\to 0 \\implies c+a-2b < 0 \\quad (2) $$\n\n*   **Jump Martingale Part**: For each particle, a branching event occurs at rate $N$. The branching is critical, so the expected change in $Z_t^{(N)}$ is zero. The jump contribution is a pure martingale.\n    A branching event for particle $i$ at position $X_i$ results in a change to the sum of $\\Delta Z = m_N \\varphi(X_i/r_N) \\times (\\text{offspring}-1)$.\n    The variance of the change per event is $\\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta Z)^2] = (m_N \\varphi_i)^2 \\times \\mathbb{E}[(\\text{offspring}-1)^2] = m_N^2 \\varphi_i^2 \\sigma^2 = m_N^2 \\varphi_i^2$, since $\\sigma^2=1$.\n    The rate of branching for particle $i$ is $N$. The contribution of particle $i$ to the quadratic variation in physical time $d\\tau$ is $(\\text{rate}) \\times \\mathbb{E}[(\\text{jump size})^2] d\\tau = N m_N^2 \\varphi_i^2 d\\tau$.\n    Summing over all particles:\n    $$ d[M^{jump}]_\\tau = \\sum_{i=1}^{K(\\tau)} N m_N^2 \\varphi_i^2 d\\tau = N m_N \\left(m_N \\sum_{i=1}^{K(\\tau)} \\varphi_i^2\\right) d\\tau = N m_N \\langle X_t^{(N)}, \\varphi^2 \\rangle d\\tau $$\n    In rescaled time $t$, $d[M^{jump}]_t = N m_N s_N \\langle X_t^{(N)}, \\varphi^2 \\rangle dt$.\n    For this to converge to the target quadratic variation $\\langle X_t, \\varphi^2 \\rangle dt$, we require:\n    $$ N m_N s_N \\to 1 \\implies N \\cdot N^c \\cdot N^a = N^{1+a+c} \\to 1 \\implies 1+a+c=0 \\quad (3) $$\n\n**2.3. Solving the System of Conditions**\nWe have a system of one equation, one inequality, and one additional constraint from the initial conditions:\n1.  $a - 2b = 0$\n2.  $c+a-2b < 0$\n3.  $1+a+c = 0$\n4.  $m_N K(0) \\to M_0 \\implies N^c K(0) \\sim O(1)$\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2): $c+(2b)-2b < 0 \\implies c < 0$.\nThe system is underdetermined with two equations ($a=2b$, $c=-1-a$) for three unknowns, subject to $c<0$. This defines a one-parameter family of possible scalings. To obtain the unique answer solicited by the problem, we must introduce an additional constraint. In the context of branching particle systems, the scaling parameter $N$ (here, the branching rate) is conventionally tied to the initial number of particles. The most natural and standard assumption is that the number of initial particles is of order $N$.\nLet's assume $K(0) \\propto N$.\nFrom condition (4), $N^c \\cdot N \\sim O(1) \\implies N^{c+1} \\sim N^0$, which gives $c+1=0$, so $c=-1$.\nThis choice satisfies the condition $c<0$. Now we can uniquely determine the other exponents.\n\nSubstitute $c=-1$ into (3):\n$1+a+(-1)=0 \\implies a=0$.\n\nSubstitute $a=0$ into (1):\n$0 - 2b = 0 \\implies b=0$.\n\nThus, the unique scaling exponents that satisfy the required conditions under this standard convention are $(a,b,c)=(0,0,-1)$.\n\n**2.4. Final Expressions**\nThe explicit forms of the scaling factors are:\n-   Time scaling: $s_N = N^a = N^0 = 1$.\n-   Space scaling: $r_N = N^b = N^0 = 1$.\n-   Mass scaling: $m_N = N^c = N^{-1}$.\n\nThe resulting scaling expressions are $(s_N, r_N, m_N) = (1, 1, N^{-1})$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & N^{-1} \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2987502"}, {"introduction": "Once a superprocess is defined, a primary goal is to characterize its behavior.

The objects and properties described, such as the Dawson–Watanabe superprocess, Feller semigroups, and the canonical martingale formulation, are standard and rigorously defined. The problem is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and objective, free from any of the flaws listed in the validation criteria.\n\nWe are tasked with two objectives: first, to derive a closed-form expression for the covariance kernel $K_t(\\phi,\\psi)$, and second, to evaluate this expression for a specific choice of test functions under the condition of trivial spatial motion.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the covariance kernel $K_t(\\phi,\\psi)$. By definition, the covariance is\n$K_t(\\phi,\\psi) := \\mathrm{Cov}(\\langle X_t,\\phi\\rangle, \\langle X_t,\\psi\\rangle) = \\mathbb{E}[\\langle X_t,\\phi\\rangle \\langle X_t,\\psi\\rangle] - \\mathbb{E}[\\langle X_t,\\phi\\rangle]\\mathbb{E}[\\langle X_t,\\psi\\rangle]$.\nThe problem states that for any bounded measurable function $\\phi$, the process $M_t(\\phi) := \\langle X_t,\\phi\\rangle - \\langle \\mu,\\phi\\rangle$ is a martingale starting at $M_0(\\phi) = \\langle X_0,\\phi\\rangle - \\langle \\mu,\\phi\\rangle = \\langle \\mu,\\phi\\rangle - \\langle \\mu,\\phi\\rangle = 0$.\nA fundamental property of martingales starting at $0$ is that their expectation is $0$ for all time $t \\ge 0$. Thus, $\\mathbb{E}[M_t(\\phi)] = 0$. This implies\n$\\mathbb{E}[\\langle X_t,\\phi\\rangle - \\langle \\mu,\\phi\\rangle] = 0 \\implies \\mathbb{E}[\\langle X_t,\\phi\\rangle] = \\langle \\mu,\\phi\\rangle$.\nThis holds for any bounded measurable test function. Using this, the covariance expression can be rewritten in terms of the martingale $M_t$:\n$K_t(\\phi,\\psi) = \\mathbb{E}[(\\langle X_t,\\phi\\rangle - \\langle \\mu,\\phi\\rangle)(\\langle X_t,\\psi\\rangle - \\langle \\mu,\\psi\\rangle)] = \\mathbb{E}[M_t(\\phi)M_t(\\psi)]$.\nThe process $M_t$ is given as a square-integrable martingale. A key property of square-integrable martingales is the martingale isometry, which relates the second moment of the martingale at time $t$ to the expectation of its predictable quadratic covariation process up to time $t$. Specifically, $\\mathbb{E}[M_t(\\phi)M_t(\\psi)] = \\mathbb{E}[\\langle M(\\phi),M(\\psi)\\rangle_t]$.\nThe problem provides the form of the predictable quadratic covariation:\n$\\langle M(\\phi),M(\\psi)\\rangle_t = \\int_0^t \\langle X_s,\\phi\\,\\psi\\rangle\\,ds$.\nCombining these facts, we have\n$K_t(\\phi,\\psi) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^t \\langle X_s,\\phi\\,\\psi\\rangle\\,ds\\right]$.\nUsing the Tonelli-Fubini theorem, we can interchange the expectation and the time integral:\n$K_t(\\phi,\\psi) = \\int_0^t \\mathbb{E}[\\langle X_s,\\phi\\,\\psi\\rangle]\\,ds$.\nThe expectation $\\mathbb{E}[\\langle X_s, f \\rangle]$ for a general superprocess is given by $\\langle \\mu, P_s f \\rangle$, where $\\{P_s\\}$ is the Feller semigroup of the underlying spatial motion. Applying this with the test function $f = \\phi\\psi$, we get\n$\\mathbb{E}[\\langle X_s,\\phi\\,\\psi\\rangle] = \\langle \\mu, P_s(\\phi\\psi)\\rangle$.\nSubstituting this back into the integral gives one form of the covariance kernel:\n$K_t(\\phi,\\psi) = \\int_0^t \\langle \\mu, P_s(\\phi\\psi)\\rangle\\,ds$.\nThe problem asks for the expression in the form $\\int_0^t \\langle P_{t-s}\\mu,\\phi\\,\\psi\\rangle\\,ds$. We can show the equivalence. By the duality property of the Feller semigroup, $\\langle \\nu, P_u f \\rangle = \\langle P_u \\nu, f \\rangle$ for any measure $\\nu$ and function $f$. Thus, $\\langle \\mu, P_{t-s}(\\phi\\psi)\\rangle = \\langle P_{t-s}\\mu, \\phi\\psi\\rangle$. So we can write\n$\\int_0^t \\langle P_{t-s}\\mu,\\phi\\,\\psi\\rangle\\,ds$.\nTo show this is equivalent to our derived form, perform a change of variables $u = t-s$ in this integral. Then $s = t-u$ and $ds = -du$. The limits of integration change from $s=0$ to $u=t$ and from $s=t$ to $u=0$.\n$\\int_{t}^{0} \\langle P_{u}\\mu,\\phi\\,\\psi\\rangle\\,(-du) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\langle P_u \\mu, \\phi\\psi \\rangle\\,du = \\int_{0}^{t} \\langle \\mu, P_u(\\phi\\psi) \\rangle\\,du$.\nThis confirms the validity of the expression given in the problem statement.\n\nNow, we proceed to the second part of the task. We must evaluate this expression for the specific case of trivial spatial motion and for the test functions $\\phi = \\psi = \\mathbf{1}_A$.\nTrivial spatial motion implies that the generator of the motion is the zero operator. The corresponding Feller semigroup is $P_t = \\exp(t \\cdot 0) = I$, where $I$ is the identity operator. This means $P_t f = f$ for any bounded measurable function $f$ and for all $t \\ge 0$.\nThe problem explicitly states this as $P_t f=f$ and $P_t \\mu = \\mu$. Let's use the first derived form of the covariance kernel for simplicity:\n$K_t(\\phi,\\psi) = \\int_0^t \\langle \\mu, P_s(\\phi\\psi)\\rangle\\,ds$.\nSubstituting $P_s(\\phi\\psi) = \\phi\\psi$, the expression simplifies to\n$K_t(\\phi,\\psi) = \\int_0^t \\langle \\mu, \\phi\\psi\\rangle\\,ds$.\nSince the integrand $\\langle \\mu, \\phi\\psi\\rangle = \\int \\phi(x)\\psi(x)\\,\\mu(dx)$ does not depend on the integration variable $s$, we can evaluate the integral directly:\n$K_t(\\phi,\\psi) = \\langle \\mu, \\phi\\psi\\rangle \\int_0^t ds = t \\langle \\mu, \\phi\\psi\\rangle$.\nNow, we set $\\phi = \\mathbf{1}_A$ and $\\psi = \\mathbf{1}_A$, where $\\mathbf{1}_A$ is the indicator function of a Borel set $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$. The product of the test functions is $\\phi\\psi = \\mathbf{1}_A \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_A = \\mathbf{1}_A^2$. Since the indicator function takes values in $\\{0, 1\\}$, we have $\\mathbf{1}_A^2 = \\mathbf{1}_A$.\nSubstituting this into our simplified expression for the kernel:\n$K_t(\\mathbf{1}_A,\\mathbf{1}_A) = t \\langle \\mu, \\mathbf{1}_A\\rangle$.\nThe term $\\langle \\mu, \\mathbf{1}_A\\rangle$ is, by definition of the notation, the integral of the function $\\mathbf{1}_A$ with respect to the measure $\\mu$:\n$\\langle \\mu, \\mathbf{1}_A\\rangle = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^d} \\mathbf{1}_A(x)\\,\\mu(dx) = \\int_A \\mu(dx) = \\mu(A)$.\nThis is the measure of the set $A$ under the initial measure $\\mu$.\nTherefore, the final expression for the covariance is\n$K_t(\\mathbf{1}_A,\\mathbf{1}_A) = t \\mu(A)$.\nThis quantity represents the variance of the mass of the superprocess within the set $A$ at time $t$, i.e., $\\mathrm{Var}(\\langle X_t, \\mathbf{1}_A \\rangle) = \\mathrm{Var}(X_t(A))$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{t \\mu(A)}\n$$", "id": "2987507"}]}
