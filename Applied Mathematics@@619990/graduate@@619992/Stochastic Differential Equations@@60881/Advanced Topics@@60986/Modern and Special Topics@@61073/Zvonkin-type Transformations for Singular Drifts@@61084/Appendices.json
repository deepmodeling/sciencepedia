This exercise asks you to numerically implement a simplified Zvonkin transformation, building the corrector function $u$ through heat kernel convolutions. By observing how the regularity of the numerically computed solution depends on parameters like the time horizon $T$, you will gain a tangible and intuitive feel for the abstract analytical estimates explored previously [@problem_id:3006574].", "problem": "Consider the one-dimensional Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) $dX_t = b(X_t)\\,dt + \\sigma\\,dW_t$ with constant diffusion coefficient $\\sigma  0$, where $W_t$ is a standard Brownian motion.

The PDE arises in the context of Zvonkin-type transformations for one-dimensional stochastic differential equations (SDEs) of the form $dX_t = b(X_t)dt + \\sigma dW_t$. The function of interest, $u(t,x)$, solves\n$$\n\\partial_t u(t,x) + \\mathcal{L}u(t,x) = -b(x), \\quad (t,x) \\in [0,T) \\times \\mathbb{R}\n$$\nwith the terminal condition $u(T,x) = 0$. The operator $\\mathcal{L}$ is the generator of the diffusion process $X_t$, which in this case is $\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 \\Delta = \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 \\partial_{xx}$.\n\nThe solution to this PDE can be formally expressed using Duhamel's principle. Changing variables to a forward-in-time problem by letting $s=T-t$ and $v(s,x) = u(T-s, x)$, the PDE becomes $\\partial_s v(s,x) = \\mathcal{L}v(s,x) - b(x)$ with initial condition $v(0,x) = 0$. The solution is given by $v(s,x) = -\\int_0^s P_{s-\\tau}b(x) d\\tau$, where $P_r$ is the semigroup generated by $\\mathcal{L}$. We are interested in $u(0,x) = v(T,x)$. Substituting $s=T$ and changing the integration variable to $r = T-\\tau$, we obtain the solution representation:\n$$\nu(0,x) = -\\int_0^T P_r b(x) \\,dr\n$$\nThe action of the heat semigroup $P_r$ is given by spatial convolution with the heat kernel $G_r(x)$: $(P_r b)(x) = (b * G_r)(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} b(y) G_r(x-y) dy$. The heat kernel for the operator $\\mathcal{L}$ with diffusion coefficient $a = \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2$ is the Gaussian function:\n$$\nG_r(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi a r}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{4ar}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma^2 r}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2 r}\\right)\n$$\nOur objective is to compute the supremum norm of the spatial gradient of the solution at time $t=0$, i.e., $\\|\\nabla u(0,\\cdot)\\|_{\\infty} = \\|\\partial_x u(0,\\cdot)\\|_{\\infty}$, and check if it satisfies the bound $\\|\\nabla u(0,\\cdot)\\|_{\\infty} \\leq 1/2$.\n\nA robust method for computing the gradient is to differentiate the integral representation with respect to $x$ before performing the numerical integration. Assuming sufficient regularity, we can interchange differentiation and integration:\n$$\n\\nabla u(0,x) = \\partial_x u(0,x) = -\\int_0^T \\partial_x (P_r b)(x) \\,dr\n$$\nThe spatial derivative of the convolution can be expressed as a convolution with the derivative of the kernel:\n$$\n\\partial_x(P_r b)(x) = \\partial_x(b * G_r)(x) = (b * \\partial_x G_r)(x)\n$$\nThe derivative of the heat kernel is given by:\n$$\n\\partial_x G_r(x) = -\\frac{x}{2\\sigma^2 r} G_r(x) = -\\frac{x}{2\\sigma^2 r \\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma^2 r}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2 r}\\right)\n$$\nThis transforms the problem into computing the quantity $V_r(x) = (b * \\partial_x G_r)(x)$ for a range of $r \\in [0,T]$ and then integrating the result with respect to $r$. The norm $\\|\\partial_x G_r\\|_1$ is proportional to $r^{-1/2}$, indicating an integrable singularity at $r=0$. The proposed non-uniform time grid $r_k = T(k/N_t)^2$ concentrates points near $r=0$ to accurately capture the behavior of this integrand.\n\nThe numerical procedure is as follows:\n\n1.  **Discretization**: We establish a uniform spatial grid $x_j$ for $j=0, \\dots, N_x-1$ on a sufficiently large domain $[-L, L]$, and a non-uniform time grid $r_k$ for $k=0, \\dots, N_t$ on $[0,T]$. The domain extent $L$ must be large enough to contain the support of $b(x)$ and the diffusive spread of the kernel up to time $T$, mitigating periodic artifacts from the FFT-based convolution.\n\n2.  **Integrand Evaluation**: The core task is to evaluate the integrand $V_r(x) = (b * \\partial_x G_r)(x)$ at each grid point $(r_k, x_j)$.\n    -   For $r_k  0$, the convolution is computed efficiently using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based on the convolution theorem, $\\mathcal{F}\\{f*g\\} = \\mathcal{F}\\{f\\} \\cdot \\mathcal{F}\\{g\\}$. We compute the FFTs of the discretized $b(x)$ and $\\partial_x G_{r_k}(x)$, multiply them in the frequency domain, and then apply an inverse FFT. The result is scaled by the spatial grid spacing $\\Delta x$ to approximate the continuous convolution integral. To use the circular convolution property of the discrete Fourier transform for linear convolution, the kernel $\\partial_x G_{r_k}(x)$ must be appropriately shifted before its transform is taken.\n    -   For the singular point $r_0=0$, we evaluate the limit of the integrand. As $r \\to 0$, the kernel $G_r(x)$ approaches a Dirac delta distribution $\\delta(x)$, and its derivative $\\partial_x G_r(x)$ approaches $\\delta'(x)$. The convolution becomes $(b * \\delta')(x) = b'(x)$. Therefore, for $r=0$, the integrand $V_0(x)$ is computed by numerically differentiating the drift function $b(x)$ using second-order finite differences.\n\n3.  **Numerical Integration**: With the integrand values $V_{r_k}(x_j)$ computed at all grid points, the integral for $\\nabla u(0,x_j)$ is approximated using the composite trapezoidal rule over the non-uniform time grid $\\{r_k\\}$:\n    $$\n    \\nabla u(0,x_j) \\approx -\\sum_{k=0}^{N_t-1} \\frac{V_{r_k}(x_j) + V_{r_{k+1}}(x_j)}{2} (r_{k+1} - r_k)\n    $$\n\n4.  **Supremum Norm Calculation**: Finally, the supremum norm of the gradient is approximated by finding the maximum absolute value of the computed vector $\\nabla u(0,x_j)$ over the spatial grid:\n    $$\n    \\|\\nabla u(0,\\cdot)\\|_{\\infty} \\approx \\max_j |\\nabla u(0,x_j)|\n    $$\nThis computed value is then compared against the threshold of $1/2$ to yield a boolean result for each test case. For the implementation, we will use robust numerical parameters ($N_x=2^{13}$, $N_t=2000$, $L=12$) to ensure accuracy across all test cases.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main solver function that iterates through test cases and prints results.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Test cases: (sigma, T, A, R)\n    test_cases = [\n        (1.0, 0.05, 1.0, 1.0),\n        (1.0, 0.10, 1.0, 1.0),\n        (0.5, 0.10, 1.0, 1.0),\n        (1.0, 0.20, 1.0, 1.0),\n        (1.0, 0.20, 0.5, 1.0),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for params in test_cases:\n        sigma, T, A, R = params\n        grad_norm = compute_grad_norm(sigma, T, A, R)\n        results.append(grad_norm = 0.5)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # str(True) is 'True', str(False) is 'False'.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(str(r) for r in results).replace('True', 'true').replace('False', 'false')}]\")\n\ndef get_bump_function(A, R):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the C-infinity bump function b(x).\n    \"\"\"\n    def b(x):\n        abs_x = np.abs(x)\n        inner_domain = abs_x  R\n        res = np.zeros_like(x)\n        # The argument to exp must be evaluated safely. \n        # (x/R)**2 can be 1.0 due to fp precision, causing 1-z**2 to be 0\n        z = x[inner_domain] / R\n        # Add a small epsilon to prevent division by zero at the boundary\n        # in floating point arithmetic\n        res[inner_domain] = A * np.exp(-1.0 / (1.0 - z**2 + 1e-15))\n        return res\n    return b\n\ndef compute_grad_norm(sigma, T, A, R):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the supremum norm of the gradient of u(0,x) for given parameters.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Numerical parameters\n    N_x = 2**13  # Number of spatial points (power of 2 for FFT efficiency)\n    N_t = 2000  # Number of time points\n    L = 12.0     # Spatial domain [-L, L], chosen to be safely large for all cases\n\n    # Spatial grid\n    dx = 2 * L / N_x\n    x = np.arange(N_x) * dx - L\n\n    # Time grid (non-uniform, refined near t=0)\n    time_grid_indices = np.arange(N_t + 1)\n    r = T * (time_grid_indices / N_t)**2\n\n    # Define drift function b(x)\n    bump_func = get_bump_function(A, R)\n    b_vec = bump_func(x)\n    \n    # FFT of b(x)\n    b_fft = np.fft.fft(b_vec)\n\n    # Array to store the integrand values V_r(x) = (b * d/dx G_r)(x)\n    integrand_values = np.zeros((N_t + 1, N_x))\n\n    # Handle the r=0 case: V_0(x) = b'(x)\n    # Using numpy.gradient for numerical derivative\n    bp_vec = np.gradient(b_vec, dx)\n    integrand_values[0, :] = bp_vec\n\n    # Loop over the time grid (from k=1, since k=0 is handled)\n    for k in range(1, N_t + 1):\n        r_k = r[k]\n        \n        # Diffusion coefficient for heat equation\n        a = 0.5 * sigma**2\n\n        # Analytically calculate the gradient of the heat kernel on the grid\n        # d/dx G_r(x) = -x / (2*a*r) * G_r(x)\n        denom_exp = 4 * a * r_k\n        exp_arg = -x**2 / denom_exp\n        \n        prefactor = 1.0 / np.sqrt(np.pi * denom_exp)\n        gauss_kernel = prefactor * np.exp(exp_arg)\n        \n        kernel_grad = (-x / (2 * a * r_k)) * gauss_kernel\n        \n        # FFT of the shifted kernel gradient for convolution\n        # np.fft.ifftshift is used to handle the kernel format for FFT-based convolution\n        kernel_grad_fft = np.fft.fft(np.fft.ifftshift(kernel_grad))\n\n        # Perform convolution in the frequency domain\n        conv_fft = b_fft * kernel_grad_fft\n        \n        # Inverse FFT to get convolution result in spatial domain\n        conv_result = np.fft.ifft(conv_fft)\n        \n        # Scale by dx to approximate the integral in the convolution definition\n        integrand_values[k, :] = conv_result.real * dx\n\n    # Integrate over time using the trapezoidal rule on the non-uniform grid\n    grad_u0 = -np.trapz(integrand_values, x=r, axis=0)\n    \n    # Compute the supremum norm\n    grad_norm = np.max(np.abs(grad_u0))\n\n    return grad_norm\n\n# The user wants the output to be a list of boolean values, but the provided\n# solution skeleton does not have a main guard.
