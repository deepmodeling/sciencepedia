It poses a standard, verifiable question within the mathematical theory of integration for non-smooth paths.

We will compute this integral using two distinct methodologies as requested.\n\n**Method 1: Computation using Classical Calculus (Riemann-Stieltjes Integral)**\n\nThe integral in question is a Riemann-Stieltjes integral, $\\int_0^1 f(t) \\, \\mathrm{d}g(t)$, with the integrand $f(t) = t^{\\beta}$ and the integrator $g(t) = t^{\\alpha}$.\n\nA fundamental theorem of Riemann-Stieltjes integration states that if the integrator $g$ is absolutely continuous on $[a,b]$, then the Riemann-Stieltjes integral exists and can be computed as a standard Riemann integral:\n$$\n\\int_a^b f(t) \\, \\mathrm{d}g(t) = \\int_a^b f(t) g'(t) \\, \\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nwhere $g'(t)$ is the derivative of $g(t)$.\n\nWe must first establish that the integrator $g(t) = t^{\\alpha}$ is absolutely continuous on the interval $[0,1]$ for $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$. A function is absolutely continuous on a compact interval if its derivative exists almost everywhere, is Lebesgue integrable, and the function can be recovered from its derivative by integration.\n\nThe derivative of $g(t) = t^{\\alpha}$ is $g'(t) = \\alpha t^{\\alpha-1}$, which is defined for $t \\in (0,1]$. We check for its integrability on $[0,1]$:\n$$\n\\int_0^1 |g'(t)| \\, \\mathrm{d}t = \\int_0^1 |\\alpha t^{\\alpha-1}| \\, \\mathrm{d}t = \\alpha \\int_0^1 t^{\\alpha-1} \\, \\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nSince $\\alpha  0$, the constant $\\alpha$ is positive. The integral is an improper integral at $t=0$. It converges if and only if the exponent $\\alpha-1$ is greater than $-1$, which means $\\alpha  0$. This condition is satisfied, as the problem states $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$.\nEvaluating the integral gives:\n$$\n\\alpha \\left[ \\frac{t^{\\alpha}}{\\alpha} \\right]_0^1 = [t^{\\alpha}]_0^1 = 1^{\\alpha} - 0^{\\alpha} = 1\n$$\nSince the derivative $g'(t)$ is integrable on $[0,1]$, the function $g(t) = t^{\\alpha}$ is absolutely continuous on $[0,1]$.\n\nWe can now convert the Riemann-Stieltjes integral into a Riemann integral:\n$$\nI = \\int_0^1 t^{\\beta} \\, \\mathrm{d}(t^{\\alpha}) = \\int_0^1 t^{\\beta} (\\alpha t^{\\alpha-1}) \\, \\mathrm{d}t = \\alpha \\int_0^1 t^{\\alpha + \\beta - 1} \\, \\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nThis is an improper Riemann integral. It converges if the exponent $\\alpha + \\beta - 1$ is greater than $-1$, which requires $\\alpha + \\beta  0$. Since $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$ and $\\beta \\in (0,1)$, this condition is met. We can evaluate the integral:\n$$\nI = \\alpha \\left[ \\frac{t^{\\alpha+\\beta}}{\\alpha+\\beta} \\right]_0^1\n$$\nThe problem specifies that $\\alpha + \\beta  1$, which implies $\\alpha + \\beta  0$. Therefore, substituting the limits of integration yields:\n$$\nI = \\alpha \\left( \\frac{1^{\\alpha+\\beta}}{\\alpha+\\beta} - \\frac{0^{\\alpha+\\beta}}{\\alpha+\\beta} \\right) = \\alpha \\left( \\frac{1}{\\alpha+\\beta} - 0 \\right) = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}\n$$\n\n**Method 2: Computation using Young Integration**\n\nThe theory of Young integration provides a framework for integrating a path $f$ with respect to a path $g$ provided they have sufficient regularity, measured by their Hölder exponents. The integral is defined if $f$ is $\\gamma_1$-Hölder continuous and $g$ is $\\gamma_2$-Hölder continuous with $\\gamma_1 + \\gamma_2  1$.\n\nFirst, we must verify that $f(t) = t^{\\beta}$ is $\\beta$-Hölder continuous and $g(t) = t^{\\alpha}$ is $\\alpha$-Hölder continuous for $\\alpha, \\beta \\in (0,1)$. For any exponent $\\gamma \\in (0,1)$, the function $h(t) = t^{\\gamma}$ is concave on $[0, \\infty)$. A property of concave functions is that for any $s, t$ in their domain with $s  t$, we have $h(t) - h(s) \\le h(t-s) - h(0)$. Applied to $h(t)=t^\\gamma$ on $[0,1]$, for $0 \\le s  t \\le 1$, this gives:\n$$\nt^{\\gamma} - s^{\\gamma} \\le (t-s)^{\\gamma}\n$$\nSince both sides are non-negative, we have $|t^{\\gamma} - s^{\\gamma}| \\le |t-s|^{\\gamma}$. This confirms that $t^{\\gamma}$ is $\\gamma$-Hölder continuous (with a Hölder constant $C=1$). Thus, $f(t)=t^{\\beta}$ is $\\beta$-Hölder continuous, and $g(t)=t^{\\alpha}$ is $\\alpha$-Hölder continuous.\n\nThe problem states that $\\alpha + \\beta  1$, which is precisely the condition required for the existence of the Young integral $\\int_0^1 f \\, \\mathrm{d}g$.\n\nA central theorem connecting Young integration to classical integration, stated in the problem, is that the Young integral coincides with the Riemann-Stieltjes integral if the integrator $g$ has bounded variation. A function has bounded variation if its total variation is finite. As shown in Method 1, the total variation of $g(t)=t^{\\alpha}$ on $[0,1]$ is:\n$$\nV_0^1(g) = \\int_0^1 |g'(t)| \\, \\mathrm{d}t = 1\n$$\nSince the total variation is finite ($1  \\infty$), the function $g(t) = t^{\\alpha}$ is of bounded variation on $[0,1]$.\n\nBy this theorem, the value of the Young integral is identical to the value of the Riemann-Stieltjes integral:\n$$\n\\int_0^1 t^{\\beta} \\, \\mathrm{d}(t^{\\alpha}) \\quad (\\text{Young}) \\quad = \\quad \\int_0^1 t^{\\beta} \\, \\mathrm{d}(t^{\\alpha}) \\quad (\\text{Riemann-Stieltjes})\n$$\nThe computation of the Riemann-Stieltjes integral has already been performed in Method 1. Therefore, the value obtained is the same.\n$$\nI = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}\n$$\n\n**Explanation of Agreement**\n\nThe two methods yield the same result not by coincidence, but as a direct consequence of the underlying mathematical structure. The agreement is guaranteed by a consistency theorem between the two theories of integration.\n\nThe integrator function $g(t) = t^{\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$ is sufficiently \"regular\" or \"smooth\" to be handled by classical theories. Specifically, it is absolutely continuous, and therefore of bounded variation. This regularity allows the Riemann-Stieltjes integral $\\int_0^1 f \\, \\mathrm{d}g$ to be defined and computed as a standard Riemann integral $\\int_0^1 f g' \\, \\mathrm{d}t$, which is the essence of Method 1.\n\nSimultaneously, the integrator $g(t) = t^{\\alpha}$ and the integrand $f(t) = t^{\\beta}$ satisfy the Hölder continuity conditions ($\\alpha$-Hölder and $\\beta$-Hölder, respectively) with $\\alpha+\\beta1$. This places them in the domain of Young's integration theory, a more general framework designed to handle paths that are too \"rough\" for Riemann-Stieltjes integration (i.e., not of bounded variation).\n\nThe core of the matter is that the domain of Riemann-Stieltjes integration (for integrators of bounded variation) is a subset of the domain of Young integration. Foundational theorems in this area prove that when an integral is defined under both theories (as is the case here), their values must coincide. Method 2 is an application of this principle: we identify that the problem satisfies the conditions for both theories and invoke the theorem that guarantees their equivalence, thereby reducing the problem to the calculation already performed in Method 1. The condition $\\alpha + \\beta  1$ is crucial for validating the problem within the Young framework, even though the integral could have been computed via Riemann-Stieltjes without it (since $\\alpha+\\beta0$ is sufficient for the final Riemann integral to converge).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}}\n$$", "id": "3006466"}, {"introduction": "This practice advances our study to a more intricate scenario involving a convolution-type integral, a structure frequently encountered in fields like fractional calculus.

The integrand $f_t(s) = (t-s)^{\\lambda-1}$ is also continuous on such an interval for any $\\lambda0$.

By the Mean Value Theorem, $x(s)$ is Lipschitz continuous, which is Hölder continuity of exponent $1$. Thus, $\\rho=1$.\n    - In summary, for any $\\alpha0$, the optimal Hölder exponent on $[0,t]$ is $\\rho = \\min(\\alpha, 1) \\in (0,1]$.\n\n2.  **Hölder exponent of the integrand $f(s)=(t-s)^{\\lambda-1}$**:\n    - For $\\lambda \\in (0, 1)$, the exponent $\\lambda-1$ is negative. The function $f(s)$ is unbounded on $[0,t]$ as $s \\to t$. For a function to be Hölder continuous on a compact interval $[0,t]$ in the sense of the provided definition, it must be bounded. Therefore, for $0  \\lambda  1$, $f(s)$ is not Hölder continuous on $[0,t]$.\n    - For $\\lambda=1$, $f(s)=(t-s)^0=1$. A constant function is Lipschitz and thus Hölder continuous for any exponent in $(0,1]$. We can take the maximal value $\\gamma=1$.\n    - For $\\lambda \\in (1, 2]$, the exponent $\\lambda-1 \\in (0,1]$. The function $y \\mapsto y^{\\lambda-1}$ is Hölder continuous with exponent $\\lambda-1$. It follows that $f(s)$ is Hölder continuous with exponent $\\gamma=\\lambda-1$.\n    - For $\\lambda  2$, the derivative $f'(s) = -(\\lambda-1)(t-s)^{\\lambda-2}$ is continuous and bounded on $[0,t]$. Hence, $f(s)$ is Lipschitz, which means it is Hölder continuous with exponent $\\gamma=1$.\n    - In summary, for $f(s)$ to be Hölder continuous on $[0,t]$, we must have $\\lambda \\ge 1$. The optimal Hölder exponent $\\gamma \\in (0,1]$ is given by $\\gamma=1$ if $\\lambda=1$ or $\\lambda2$, and $\\gamma=\\lambda-1$ if $\\lambda \\in (1,2]$.

The condition becomes $1 + \\rho  1$, which simplifies to $\\rho  0$. Since $\\rho=\\min(\\alpha,1)$ and $\\alpha  0$, this is always true. Thus, for $\\lambda=1$, the integral exists as a Young integral for all $\\alpha  0$.\n    - **Case 2: $\\lambda  1$.** We have $\\gamma = \\min(\\lambda-1, 1)$ and $\\rho=\\min(\\alpha, 1)$. Both $\\gamma$ and $\\rho$ are in $(0,1]$.

Thus,\n$$\nh \\sum_{n=1}^{K-1} 2^{n/2}  \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}-1} h h^{-1/2} = C_1 h^{1/2}.\n$$\nFor the high-frequency part ($n \\ge K$), we use the bound $|\\cos(x)-\\cos(y)| \\le 2$.\n$$\n\\left| \\sum_{n=K}^{\\infty} 2^{-n/2}(\\cos(2^n t) - \\cos(2^n s)) \\right| \\le \\sum_{n=K}^{\\infty} 2^{-n/2} \\cdot 2 = 2 \\sum_{n=K}^{\\infty} (2^{-1/2})^n.\n$$\nThis is another geometric sum:\n$$\n2 \\frac{(2^{-1/2})^K}{1-2^{-1/2}} = C_2 \\, 2^{-K/2}.\n$$\nFrom our choice of $K$, $2^{-K} \\le h$, which implies $2^{-K/2} \\le h^{1/2}$. Thus, the high-frequency part is bounded by $C_2 h^{1/2}$.\nCombining the two bounds, we get $|f(t)-f(s)| \\le (C_1+C_2)|t-s|^{1/2}$. This proves that $f$ is Hölder continuous with exponent $1/2$. The argument for $g(t)$ is identical, using $|\\sin(x)-\\sin(y)| \\le |x-y|$ and $|\\sin(x)-\\sin(y)| \\le 2$.\n\n### Part 2: Explicit Expression for the Riemann-Stieltjes Sums\n\nLet $\\pi^{(m)} = \\{t_i = i \\frac{2\\pi}{2^m} : i=0, \\dots, 2^m\\}$. The Riemann-Stieltjes sum is\n$$\nS_m = S_{\\pi^{(m)}}(f,g) = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} f(t_i) (g(t_{i+1}) - g(t_i)).\n$$\nWe can write this as $S_m = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} f(t_i) g(t_{i+1}) - \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} f(t_i) g(t_i)$.\nLet's analyze the second term, which we call $B_m$:\n$$\nB_m = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} f(t_i)g(t_i) = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} \\left(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} 2^{-n/2}\\cos(2^n t_i)\\right) \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} 2^{-k/2}\\sin(2^k t_i)\\right).\n$$\nDue to uniform convergence, we can swap the summation order:\n$$\nB_m = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} 2^{-(n+k)/2} \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} \\cos(2^n t_i) \\sin(2^k t_i).\n$$\nThe inner sum over $i$ is identically zero. To see this, let $\\phi_{n,k}(i) = \\cos(2^n i \\frac{2\\pi}{2^m}) \\sin(2^k i \\frac{2\\pi}{2^m})$. The function $\\phi_{n,k}(i)$ is zero for $i=0$ (since $\\sin(0)=0$). For $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, 2^m-1\\}$, the argument of the trigonometric functions is $2\\pi$ times a rational number. We observe that $\\cos(2^n(2^m-i)\\frac{2\\pi}{2^m}) = \\cos(2^n(2\\pi - i\\frac{2\\pi}{2^m})) = \\cos(-2^n i\\frac{2\\pi}{2^m}) = \\cos(2^n i\\frac{2\\pi}{2^m})$, whereas $\\sin(2^k(2^m-i)\\frac{2\\pi}{2^m}) = \\sin(-2^k i\\frac{2\\pi}{2^m}) = -\\sin(2^k i\\frac{2\\pi}{2^m})$. Therefore, $\\phi_{n,k}(2^m-i) = -\\phi_{n,k}(i)$. The sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{2^m-1} \\phi_{n,k}(i)$ consists of pairs that cancel out. If $2^m$ is even, the term $i=2^{m-1}$ is its own pair; for this index, $t_{2^{m-1}}=\\pi$, and $\\sin(2^k \\pi)=0$ for $k\\ge 1$, so this term is zero. Thus, the entire sum over $i$ is zero, and $B_m = 0$.\n\nNow we are left with $S_m = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} f(t_i) g(t_{i+1})$. Let $\\Delta t = 2\\pi/2^m$.\n$$\nS_m = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} 2^{-(n+k)/2} \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} \\cos(2^n t_i) \\sin(2^k t_{i+1}).\n$$\nLet's analyze the inner sum $C_{n,k} = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} \\cos(2^n i \\Delta t) \\sin(2^k (i+1) \\Delta t)$.\nUsing $\\sin(A+B) = \\sin A \\cos B + \\cos A \\sin B$:\n$$\nC_{n,k} = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} \\cos(2^n i \\Delta t) [\\sin(2^k i \\Delta t)\\cos(2^k \\Delta t) + \\cos(2^k i \\Delta t)\\sin(2^k \\Delta t)].\n$$\n$$\nC_{n,k} = \\cos(2^k \\Delta t) \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} \\cos(2^n i \\Delta t)\\sin(2^k i \\Delta t) + \\sin(2^k \\Delta t) \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} \\cos(2^n i \\Delta t)\\cos(2^k i \\Delta t).\n$$\nThe first sum over $i$ is zero by the same symmetry argument as for $B_m$. So we only have the second term:\n$$\nC_{n,k} = \\sin(2^k \\Delta t) \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} \\cos(2^n i \\frac{2\\pi}{2^m})\\cos(2^k i \\frac{2\\pi}{2^m}).\n$$\nThis is a standard orthogonality relation for discrete cosine sums. The sum is non-zero only if $2^n \\equiv \\pm 2^k \\pmod{2^m}$.\nLet's assume $n,k  m$. If $k  n  m$, then $2^m$ cannot divide $2^n \\pm 2^k = 2^k(2^{n-k} \\pm 1)$ since $km$ and $2^{n-k} \\pm 1$ is odd. So the sum is zero for $n \\ne k$.\nTherefore, the only non-zero contributions to $S_m$ for $n,km$ come from diagonal terms where $n=k$.\nFor $n=k$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} \\cos^2(2^n i \\Delta t) = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} \\frac{1+\\cos(2^{n+1} i \\Delta t)}{2} = \\frac{2^m}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} \\cos(2^{n+1} i \\frac{2\\pi}{2^m}).\n$$\nThe second sum is zero unless $2^{n+1}$ is a multiple of $2^m$, i.e., $n+1 \\ge m$.\n- If $n  m-1$: The sum is $2^m/2$.\n- If $n = m-1$: $2^{n+1}=2^m$, the argument of cosine is $2\\pi i$, so $\\cos(2\\pi i) = 1$. The sum is $2^m$. Total sum becomes $2^m/2 + 2^m/2 = 2^m$.\n- If $n \\ge m$: $2^{n+1}$ is a multiple of $2^m$. The sum is $2^m$ as well.\n\nNow we compute the total sum $S_m = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} 2^{-n} C_{n,n}$.\n- For $n  m-1$: Contribution is $2^{-n} \\sin(2^n \\Delta t) \\frac{2^m}{2} = 2^{-n} 2^{m-1} \\sin(2\\pi / 2^{m-n})$.\n- For $n = m-1$: The cosine sum is $2^m$. $C_{m-1,m-1} = \\sin(2^{m-1} \\Delta t) \\cdot 2^m = \\sin(\\pi) \\cdot 2^m = 0$. Contribution is zero.\n- For $n \\ge m$: The cosine sum is $2^m$. $C_{n,n} = \\sin(2^n \\Delta t) \\cdot 2^m = \\sin(2^{n-m} 2\\pi) \\cdot 2^m = 0$. Contribution is zero.\n\nThus, only terms with $n \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, m-2\\}$ contribute.\n$$\nS_m = \\sum_{n=1}^{m-2} 2^{-n} 2^{m-1} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{2^{m-n}}\\right).\n$$\nTo simplify, let $j = m-n$. As $n$ runs from $1$ to $m-2$, $j$ runs from $m-1$ down to $2$.\n$$\nS_m = \\sum_{j=2}^{m-1} 2^{-(m-j)} 2^{m-1} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{2^j}\\right) = \\sum_{j=2}^{m-1} 2^{j-1} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{2^j}\\right).\n$$\nThis is the explicit expression for $S_m$.\n\n### Part 3: Asymptotic Behavior and Limit\n\nWe have $S_m = \\sum_{j=2}^{m-1} a_j$, where $a_j = 2^{j-1} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{2^j}\\right)$.\nFor large $j$, we have the Taylor expansion $\\sin(x) = x - x^3/6 + O(x^5)$.\n$$\na_j = 2^{j-1} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{2^j} - O\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{2^j}\\right)^3\\right) \\right) = \\pi - O\\left(\\frac{1}{2^{2j}}\\right).\n$$\nSo, $\\lim_{j\\to\\infty} a_j = \\pi$. Since each term in the sum for $S_m$ approaches $\\pi$ and the number of terms is $m-2$, we expect $S_m$ to grow linearly with $m$, approximately as $(m-2)\\pi$.\n\nTo find the exact value of $\\lim_{m\\to\\infty} \\frac{S_m}{m}$, we can apply the Stolz-Cesàro theorem. Let $X_m = S_m$ and $Y_m=m$. The limit is equal to $\\lim_{m\\to\\infty} \\frac{X_{m+1}-X_m}{Y_{m+1}-Y_m}$, provided this limit exists.\n$$\nY_{m+1} - Y_m = (m+1) - m = 1.\n$$\n$$\nX_{m+1} - X_m = S_{m+1} - S_m = \\left(\\sum_{j=2}^{m} a_j\\right) - \\left(\\sum_{j=2}^{m-1} a_j\\right) = a_m.\n$$\nSo we need to compute the limit of $a_m$ as $m\\to\\infty$.\n$$\n\\lim_{m\\to\\infty} \\frac{S_m}{m} = \\lim_{m\\to\\infty} a_m = \\lim_{m\\to\\infty} 2^{m-1} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{2^m}\\right).\n$$\nLet $x = \\frac{2\\pi}{2^m}$. As $m\\to\\infty$, $x\\to 0$. The expression becomes\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to 0} 2^{m-1} \\sin(x) = \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{1}{2} 2^m \\sin(x) = \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{2\\pi}{x} \\sin(x) = \\pi \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{\\sin x}{x}.\n$$\nUsing the fundamental trigonometric limit $\\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{\\sin x}{x} = 1$, we get\n$$\n\\lim_{m\\to\\infty} \\frac{S_m}{m} = \\pi \\cdot 1 = \\pi.\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\pi}\n$$", "id": "3006476"}]}
