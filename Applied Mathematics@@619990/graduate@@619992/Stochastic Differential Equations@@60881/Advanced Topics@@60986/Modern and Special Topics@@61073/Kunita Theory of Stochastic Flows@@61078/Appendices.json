Here, $A, B_{1}, \\dots, B_{m}$ are constant matrices in $\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$, and $W^{1}, \\dots, W^{m}$ are independent standard Brownian motions.\n\nThe solution to this SDE, starting from $x$ at time $s$, is given by the stochastic flow of diffeomorphisms, denoted by $X_t = \\varphi_{s,t}(x)$. Since the coefficients of the SDE, $b(x)=Ax$ and $\\sigma_i(x)=B_ix$, are linear functions of the state $x$, the resulting flow map $\\varphi_{s,t}$ is also linear for all $s,t$. This linearity implies that the flow can be represented by a matrix-valued stochastic process $U_{s,t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$, which is known as the linear cocycle or the fundamental solution of the SDE. The action of the flow is thus given by matrix multiplication:\n$$\n\\varphi_{s,t}(x) = U_{s,t} x\n$$\n\nOur first objective is to derive the SDE that governs the evolution of the cocycle $U_{s,t}$. To achieve this, we differentiate the expression for the flow $\\varphi_{s,t}(x)$ with respect to time $t$ and substitute it into the original SDE. A key feature of the Stratonovich integral is that it obeys the classical chain rule of differentiation, which simplifies this derivation considerably.\n\nApplying the differential operator $d$ to $X_t = \\varphi_{s,t}(x) = U_{s,t} x$, and noting that $x$ is a constant vector (the initial condition), we obtain:\n$$\ndX_t = d(U_{s,t} x) = (dU_{s,t})x\n$$\nNow, we substitute $X_t = U_{s,t} x$ into the right-hand side of the original SDE:\n$$\nA X_{t}\\,dt + \\sum_{i=1}^{m} B_{i} X_{t}\\circ dW_{t}^{i} = A (U_{s,t}x)\\,dt + \\sum_{i=1}^{m} B_{i} (U_{s,t}x)\\circ dW_{t}^{i}\n$$\nBy linearity of matrix multiplication, this expression can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\left( A U_{s,t}\\,dt + \\sum_{i=1}^{m} B_{i} U_{s,t}\\circ dW_{t}^{i} \\right) x\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for $dX_t$, we have:\n$$\n(dU_{s,t})x = \\left( A U_{s,t}\\,dt + \\sum_{i=1}^{m} B_{i} U_{s,t}\\circ dW_{t}^{i} \\right) x\n$$\nSince this equation must hold for any arbitrary initial vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, the matrix operators multiplying $x$ on both sides must be identical. This yields the linear matrix Stratonovich SDE for the cocycle $U_{s,t}$:\n$$\ndU_{s,t} = A U_{s,t}\\,dt + \\sum_{i=1}^{m} B_{i} U_{s,t}\\circ dW_{t}^{i}\n$$\nThe initial condition for $U_{s,t}$ is determined by the property that at time $t=s$, the flow maps $x$ to itself: $\\varphi_{s,s}(x) = x$.

The solution to such a linear matrix SDE, where the generating matrices $A, B_1, \\dots, B_m$ do not necessarily commute, is given by a time-ordered exponential, also known as the chronological exponential or Peano-Baker series.

As per the problem's request, we make the ordering convention precise. The chronological ordering means that in the series expansion of the exponential, the matrix differentials corresponding to later times are placed to the left. The formal expansion, often called the Dyson series, is given by a sum of iterated Stratonovich integrals:\n$$\nU_{s,t} = I + \\int_s^t dM_{\\tau_1} + \\int_s^t dM_{\\tau_1} \\int_s^{\\tau_1} dM_{\\tau_2} + \\int_s^t dM_{\\tau_1} \\int_s^{\\tau_1} dM_{\\tau_2} \\int_s^{\\tau_2} dM_{\\tau_3} + \\dots\n$$\nwhere $dM_{\\tau} = A\\,d\\tau + \\sum_{i=1}^m B_i \\circ dW_\\tau^i$.
