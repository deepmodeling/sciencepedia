For any vector field $V$, its self-commutator is identically zero:\n$$\n[V, V] = VV - VV = 0.\n$$\nIn our case, with $X_1 = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$:\n$$\n[X_1, X_1] = \\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right] = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} = 0.\n$$\nSince the only Lie bracket we can form is zero, no new vector fields are generated. Thus, the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is simply the linear span of the initial vector field $X_1$:\n$$\n\\mathfrak{g} = \\text{span}\\{X_1\\} = \\left\\{ c \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\mid c \\in \\mathbb{R} \\right\\}.\n$$\nThe dimension of the Lie algebra *at a point* $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ is the dimension of the subspace of the tangent space $T_{(x,y)}\\mathbb{R}^2$ spanned by the evaluation of the vector fields in $\\mathfrak{g}$ at that point. This subspace is denoted $\\mathfrak{g}(x,y)$.\n$$\n\\mathfrak{g}(x,y) = \\text{span}\\{X_1(x,y)\\}.\n$$\nThe vector field $X_1$ is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$. In the standard basis $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\}$ of the tangent space at any point $(x,y)$, this vector is represented as $(1, 0)$.\nTherefore, at any arbitrary point $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, the subspace spanned by the Lie algebra is:\n$$\n\\mathfrak{g}(x,y) = \\text{span}\\{(1,0)\\}.\n$$\nThis is a one-dimensional subspace of $T_{(x,y)}\\mathbb{R}^2 \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$. The dimension is therefore:\n$$\n\\dim(\\mathfrak{g}(x,y)) = 1.\n$$\n\n**2. Hörmander's Bracket-Generating Condition**\n\nFrom first principles, the Hörmander bracket-generating condition for a system on a $d$-dimensional manifold states that the Lie algebra generated by the drift and diffusion vector fields must span the entire tangent space at every point of the manifold. That is, for every point $p$, we must have:\n$$\n\\dim(\\text{Lie}\\{X_0, X_1, \\dots, X_m\\}(p)) = d.\n$$\nIn our case, the manifold is $\\mathbb{R}^2$, so its dimension is $d=2$. The generating vector fields are $\\{X_0, X_1\\}$, where $X_0 = 0$ and $X_1 = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$. As computed in Part 1, the dimension of the Lie algebra at any point $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ is:\n$$\n\\dim(\\text{Lie}\\{X_1\\}(x,y)) = 1.\n$$\nSince $1 < 2$, the Lie algebra does not span the tangent space $T_{(x,y)}\\mathbb{R}^2$. Therefore, the Hörmander bracket-generating condition does **not** hold for this system. This implies that the diffusion only acts in the $x$-direction and no amount of communication between vector fields (via Lie brackets) can generate motion in the $y$-direction.\n\n**3. Construction of a Non-Smooth Solution**\n\nWe are tasked with finding a function $u \\colon \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that is not smooth ($C^\\infty$) but satisfies $\\mathcal{L}u = 0$ in the sense of distributions. The equation is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}u = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = 0.\n$$\nAny function $u(x,y)$ that is independent of $x$ is a classical solution. If we let $u(x,y) = g(y)$ for some function $g \\colon \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, then $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = 0$.\n\nTo find a non-smooth solution, we can simply choose a non-smooth function for $g$. A canonical example of a function that is continuous but not differentiable (and therefore not smooth) is the absolute value function. Let us construct our candidate solution as:\n$$\nu(x,y) = |y|.\n$$\n**Verification of Non-Smoothness:** A function is smooth if all its partial derivatives of all orders exist and are continuous. For $u(x,y) = |y|$, the partial derivative with respect to $y$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } y > 0 \\\\ -1 & \\text{if } y < 0 \\end{cases}\n$$\nThis derivative does not exist at $y=0$. Since $u$ is not even differentiable everywhere (not $C^1$), it cannot be smooth ($C^\\infty$).\n\n**Verification of $\\mathcal{L}u = 0$ in the sense of distributions:** We must show that for any smooth, compactly supported test function $\\phi \\in C_c^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}^2)$, the equality $\\langle \\mathcal{L}u, \\phi \\rangle = 0$ holds. By the definition of distributional derivatives, this is equivalent to showing $\\langle u, \\mathcal{L}^*\\phi \\rangle = 0$, where $\\mathcal{L}^*$ is the formal adjoint of $\\mathcal{L}$. The operator $\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}$ is formally self-adjoint, so $\\mathcal{L}^* = \\mathcal{L}$. We need to verify:\n$$\n\\iint_{\\mathbb{R}^2} u(x,y) (\\mathcal{L}\\phi)(x,y) \\, \\mathrm{d}x \\, \\mathrm{d}y = 0.\n$$\nSubstituting our functions:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\iint_{\\mathbb{R}^2} |y| \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2}(x,y) \\, \\mathrm{d}x \\, \\mathrm{d}y.\n$$\nSince $\\phi$ and its derivatives are continuous and compactly supported, Fubini's theorem allows us to change the order of integration:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |y| \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2}(x,y) \\, \\mathrm{d}x \\right) \\mathrm{d}y.\n$$\nWe evaluate the inner integral with respect to $x$. Since $\\phi \\in C_c^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}^2)$, for any fixed $y$, the function $x \\mapsto \\phi(x,y)$ is a smooth function of $x$ with compact support. By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2}(x,y) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\left[ \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}(x,y) \\right]_{x=-\\infty}^{x=\\infty}.\n$$\nBecause $\\phi$ has compact support, its derivatives must vanish outside a bounded set. Thus, $\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}(x,y) \\to 0$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$. So, the inner integral is $0 - 0 = 0$.\nThe entire expression becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |y| \\cdot 0 \\, \\mathrm{d}y = 0.\n$$\nThis rigorously verifies that $\\mathcal{L}u = 0$ in the sense of distributions for $u(x,y) = |y|$.\n\n**4. Conclusion on Hypoellipticity**\n\nA linear partial differential operator $\\mathcal{L}$ is defined as hypoelliptic on an open set $U$ if, for any distribution $u$ on $U$, the condition that $\\mathcal{L}u$ is a smooth function on $U$ implies that $u$ itself must be a smooth function on $U$. In more concise notation:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}u \\in C^\\infty(U) \\implies u \\in C^\\infty(U).\n$$\nIn Part 3, we constructed a function $u(x,y) = |y|$ and considered the operator $\\mathcal{L}$ on the open set $U = \\mathbb{R}^2$. We showed two things:\n1. $\\mathcal{L}u = 0$. The zero function is a smooth function on $\\mathbb{R}^2$, i.e., $0 \\in C^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}^2)$.\n2. The function $u(x,y) = |y|$ is not smooth on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nWe have found a distribution $u$ for which $\\mathcal{L}u$ is smooth, but $u$ is not. This provides a direct counterexample to the definition of hypoellipticity.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that the operator $\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}$ is **not hypoelliptic** on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This result is consistent with Hörmander's theorem, which states that an operator of this form is hypoelliptic if and only if the bracket-generating condition holds. We showed in Part 2 that the condition fails.\n\nThe final answer requested is the dimension computed in Part 1 at the specific point $(0,0)$. As demonstrated, the dimension of the Lie algebra at any point $(x,y)$ is constant and equal to $1$. This includes the point $(0,0)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2979495"}]}
