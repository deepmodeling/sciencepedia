It is scientifically grounded in the theory of stochastic processes, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard but non-trivial exercise in verifying the definitional properties of a Lévy process. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nOur objective is to construct a stochastic process $\\{X_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ that possesses independent increments but fails to have stationary increments, thus disqualifying it from being a Lévy process. We are instructed to base our construction on a standard Brownian motion.\n\nLet $\\{B_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ be a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion (also known as a Wiener process) defined on a filtered probability space $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\{\\mathcal{F}_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}, \\mathbb{P})$. The defining properties of $\\{B_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ are:\n1.  $B_0 = 0$ almost surely.\n2.  The sample paths $t \\mapsto B_t(\\omega)$ are continuous for almost all $\\omega \\in \\Omega$.\n3.  For any $0 \\leq s  t$, the increment $B_t - B_s$ is a normally distributed random variable, $B_t - B_s \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t-s)$.\n4.  For any sequence of times $0 \\leq t_1  t_2  \\dots  t_n$, the increments $B_{t_2} - B_{t_1}, B_{t_3} - B_{t_2}, \\dots, B_{t_n} - B_{t_{n-1}}$ are mutually independent random variables.\n\nFrom these properties, it follows that a standard Brownian motion is a Lévy process. Specifically, the distribution of an increment $B_t - B_s$ depends only on the time difference $t-s$, satisfying the stationary increments property.\n\nTo construct a process that lacks stationary increments, we can introduce a non-linear time-scaling to the Brownian motion. Let us define the process $\\{X_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ as:\n$$X_t = B_{t^2}$$\nWe will now verify the properties of this process with respect to the definition of a Lévy process.\n\n1.  **Initial Condition**:\n    At time $t=0$, we have $X_0 = B_{0^2} = B_0$. By the definition of Brownian motion, $B_0 = 0$ almost surely. Thus, $X_0 = 0$ a.s.\n\n2.  **Stochastic Continuity**:\n    A process with almost surely continuous sample paths is stochastically continuous. The mapping $t \\mapsto t^2$ is continuous. Since the sample paths of a Brownian motion $t \\mapsto B_t$ are almost surely continuous, the composition $t \\mapsto B_{t^2}$ results in almost surely continuous paths for $X_t$. Therefore, $\\{X_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ is stochastically continuous.\n\n3.  **Independent Increments**:\n    Consider any sequence of times $0 \\leq t_1  t_2  \\dots  t_n$. The corresponding increments of the process $X_t$ are:\n    $$X_{t_{k+1}} - X_{t_k} = B_{t_{k+1}^2} - B_{t_k^2}$$\n    for $k=1, 2, \\dots, n-1$. Since the function $f(t) = t^2$ is strictly increasing for $t \\geq 0$, the condition $t_1  t_2  \\dots  t_n$ implies $t_1^2  t_2^2  \\dots  t_n^2$.\n    The time intervals for the underlying Brownian motion, $[t_1^2, t_2^2), [t_2^2, t_3^2), \\dots, [t_{n-1}^2, t_n^2)$, are non-overlapping.\n    By property $4$ of Brownian motion, increments over non-overlapping time intervals are independent. Therefore, the random variables $B_{t_2^2} - B_{t_1^2}, B_{t_3^2} - B_{t_2^2}, \\dots, B_{t_n^2} - B_{t_{n-1}^2}$ are mutually independent. This establishes that the process $\\{X_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ has independent increments.\n\n4.  **Stationary Increments**:\n    This is the property we hypothesize will fail. The stationary increments property requires that the distribution of an increment $X_t - X_s$ depends only on the time difference $t-s$. Let us analyze the distribution of a generic increment $X_t - X_s$ for $0 \\leq s  t$.\n    The increment is given by $X_t - X_s = B_{t^2} - B_{s^2}$.\n    From the properties of Brownian motion, the increment $B_{t^2} - B_{s^2}$ is normally distributed with mean $0$ and variance equal to the length of the time interval, which is $t^2 - s^2$.\n    So, $X_t - X_s \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t^2 - s^2)$.\n    The distribution of the increment clearly depends on both $s$ and $t$, not just on the difference $t-s$. To demonstrate this explicitly, let us compare two increments of the same duration $\\tau  0$, but starting at different times.\n    -   Consider the increment from time $0$ to $\\tau$: $X_\\tau - X_0 = X_\\tau$. Its distribution is $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\tau^2 - 0^2) = \\mathcal{N}(0, \\tau^2)$.\n    -   Consider the increment from time $s  0$ to $s+\\tau$: $X_{s+\\tau} - X_s$. Its distribution is $\\mathcal{N}(0, (s+\\tau)^2 - s^2) = \\mathcal{N}(0, 2s\\tau + \\tau^2)$.\n    Since the variances $\\tau^2$ and $2s\\tau + \\tau^2$ are not equal for any $s  0$, the distributions are different. For example, $X_1 - X_0 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ while $X_2 - X_1 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 3)$. The increments are not stationary.\n\nFinally, we derive the characteristic function of the increment $X_t - X_s$. The characteristic function of a random variable $Y$ is defined as $\\phi_Y(u) = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(iuY)]$ for a real argument $u$.\nFor a normally distributed random variable $Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, the characteristic function is given by the well-known formula $\\phi_Y(u) = \\exp(i\\mu u - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 u^2)$.\nIn our case, the increment is $Y = X_t - X_s$, which follows a normal distribution with mean $\\mu = 0$ and variance $\\sigma^2 = t^2 - s^2$.\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we obtain the characteristic function for the increment $X_t - X_s$:\n$$\\phi_{X_t - X_s}(u) = \\exp\\left(i(0)u - \\frac{1}{2}(t^2 - s^2)u^2\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(t^2 - s^2)u^2\\right)$$\nThis expression explicitly shows the breakdown of stationarity. If the increments were stationary, this function would depend only on the duration $\\tau = t-s$. However, we can write $t^2 - s^2 = (t-s)(t+s) = \\tau(2s+\\tau)$, which manifestly depends on the starting time $s$ in addition to the duration $\\tau$. This confirms that $\\{X_t=B_{t^2}\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ is not a Lévy process.\nThe requested final answer is the derived closed-form expression for this characteristic function.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(t^{2} - s^{2})u^{2}\\right)}$$", "id": "2984412"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the continuous Brownian motion component, the richness of Lévy processes comes from their ability to model jumps, which are characterized by the Lévy measure $\\nu$.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n---\n\nThe problem consists of two tasks: first, to construct the measure $\\nu$ and show it is rotationally invariant, and second, to verify that it is a Lévy measure and compute a specific integral.\n\n**Task 1: Construction of $\\nu$ and justification of rotational invariance**\n\nThe measure $\\nu$ is defined by its density $\\rho(|x|)$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure $dx$ on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. For any Borel set $B \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$, the measure $\\nu(B)$ is given by the integral of its density over the set $B$:\n$$\n\\nu(B) = \\int_{B} \\rho(|x|) \\, dx\n$$\nwhere $|x|$ is the Euclidean norm of $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nTo show that $\\nu$ is rotationally invariant, we must show that $\\nu(U^{-1}B) = \\nu(B)$ for any orthogonal transformation $U \\in \\mathrm{O}(2)$ and any Borel set $B \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\nBy the definition of $\\nu$, we have:\n$$\n\\nu(U^{-1}B) = \\int_{U^{-1}B} \\rho(|x|) \\, dx\n$$\nWe perform a change of variables $y = Ux$, which implies $x = U^{-1}y$. The Jacobian determinant of this transformation is $|\\det(U^{-1})|$. Since $U$ is an orthogonal matrix, its determinant is $\\pm 1$, so $|\\det(U^{-1})| = 1$. Therefore, the differential element transforms as $dx = dy$. The domain of integration for $x$ is $U^{-1}B$, so the domain for $y$ is $U(U^{-1}B) = B$.\nApplying this change of variables to the integral gives:\n$$\n\\nu(U^{-1}B) = \\int_{B} \\rho(|U^{-1}y|) \\, dy\n$$\nA key property of orthogonal transformations is that they preserve the Euclidean norm, so $|U^{-1}y| = |y|$. Substituting this into the integral, we obtain:\n$$\n\\nu(U^{-1}B) = \\int_{B} \\rho(|y|) \\, dy\n$$\nThe right-hand side is, by definition, $\\nu(B)$. Therefore, we have shown that $\\nu(U^{-1}B) = \\nu(B)$, which proves that the measure $\\nu$ is rotationally invariant. This is a general property for measures whose Lebesgue density is a radial function.\n\n**Task 2: Verification that $\\nu$ is a Lévy measure**\n\nAccording to the definition provided, we need to check two conditions:\n1. $\\nu(\\{0\\}) = 0$.\nThe measure $\\nu$ is given to be absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The set $\\{0\\}$ is a singleton in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and its Lebesgue measure is $0$. Therefore, $\\nu(\\{0\\}) = 0$.

Let $x = (r\\cos\\theta, r\\sin\\theta)$, where $r = |x|$. The Lebesgue measure element in polar coordinates is $dx = r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$. The domain $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$ corresponds to $r \\in (0, \\infty)$ and $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The integral becomes:\n$$\nI = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (1 \\wedge r^2) \\rho(r) r \\, dr \\, d\\theta\n$$\nSince the integrand does not depend on $\\theta$, the integration over $\\theta$ yields a factor of $2\\pi$:\n$$\nI = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (1 \\wedge r^2) \\rho(r) r \\, dr\n$$\nThe function $1 \\wedge r^2$ is defined as $r^2$ for $r \\le 1$ and $1$ for $r > 1$. The density $\\rho(r)$ is also defined piecewise with a break at $r=1$.

The first integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1} r^2 \\cdot (r^{-3}) \\cdot r \\, dr = \\int_{0}^{1} r^{2-3+1} \\, dr = \\int_{0}^{1} r^0 \\, dr = \\int_{0}^{1} 1 \\, dr = [r]_0^1 = 1\n$$\nFor the interval $r \\ge 1$, we have $1 \\wedge r^2 = 1$ and $\\rho(r) = r^{-4}$. The second integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{1}^{\\infty} 1 \\cdot (r^{-4}) \\cdot r \\, dr = \\int_{1}^{\\infty} r^{-3} \\, dr\n$$\nThis is an improper integral, which we evaluate as:\n$$\n\\int_{1}^{\\infty} r^{-3} \\, dr = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{2} r^{-2} \\right]_1^{\\infty} = \\lim_{R \\to \\infty} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2R^2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2(1)^2}\\right) = 0 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nNow, we sum the two parts and multiply by $2\\pi$:\n$$\nI = 2\\pi \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = 2\\pi \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\right) = 3\\pi\n$$\nSince the integral evaluates to $3\\pi$, which is a finite value, the condition $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}} (1 \\wedge |x|^2) \\, \\nu(dx)  \\infty$ is satisfied.\n\nBoth conditions for a Lévy measure hold.

This translates to a condition on the real part of the characteristic exponent, since $|\\phi_{X_t}(\\xi)| = |\\exp(t \\psi(\\xi))| = \\exp(\\text{Re}(t \\psi(\\xi))) = \\exp(t \\cdot \\text{Re}(\\psi(\\xi)))$.\n    \n    **Condition 1:** The function $\\xi \\mapsto \\exp(t \\cdot \\text{Re}(\\psi(\\xi)))$ must be in $L^1(\\mathbb{R}^d)$ for all $t  0$. That is, for every $t0$, the integral $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^d} \\exp(t \\cdot \\text{Re}(\\psi(\\xi))) \\, d\\xi$ must be finite.\n\n2.  **Sufficient Condition for Infinite Differentiability:**\n    For the transition density $p_t(\\cdot)$ to be infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$), we can differentiate under the integral sign. The a-th partial derivative of $p_t(x)$ with respect to a multi-index $\\alpha = (\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_d)$ is given by the inverse Fourier transform of $(-i\\xi)^{\\alpha} \\phi_{X_t}(\\xi)$. For this to be well-defined and continuous for all $\\alpha$, the function $\\xi \\mapsto \\xi^{\\alpha} \\phi_{X_t}(\\xi)$ must be in $L^1(\\mathbb{R}^d)$ for every multi-index $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{N}_0^d$. This requires that the characteristic function decays faster than any polynomial as $|\\xi| \\to \\infty$.\n\n    **Condition 2:** For every multi-index $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{N}_0^d$ and for every $t0$, the function $\\xi \\mapsto \\xi^{\\alpha} \\exp(t \\psi(\\xi))$ must be in $L^1(\\mathbb{R}^d)$. That is, the integral $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^d} |\\xi^{\\alpha}| \\exp(t \\cdot \\text{Re}(\\psi(\\xi))) \\, d\\xi$ must be finite.\n\nThese two conditions provide a direct link between the analytical properties of the characteristic exponent and the regularity of the transition density.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{t}{\\pi(x^2 + t^2)}}\n$$", "id": "2984425"}]}
