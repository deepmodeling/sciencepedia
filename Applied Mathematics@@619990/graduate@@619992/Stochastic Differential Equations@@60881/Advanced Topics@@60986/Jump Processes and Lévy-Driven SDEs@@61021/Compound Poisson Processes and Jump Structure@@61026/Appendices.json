In the compound Poisson setting $\\nu(E)<\\infty$, boundedness of the integrand alone implies that compensated integrals are square-integrable and the interchange of deterministic and stochastic integrals is valid regardless of whether $H$ is predictable.\n\nD. If interchange fails in the compensated setting, replacing $\\tilde{N}$ by the raw Poisson random measure $N$ fixes the issue because $\\int H\\,N$ is always well-defined for any measurable $H$, and classical (non-stochastic) Fubini applies without square-integrability assumptions.\n\nChoose all that apply.", "solution": "**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe core of the problem is to analyze the existence and properties of the two iterated integrals $X_1$ and $X_2$, where the standard sufficient conditions for interchanging the integrals via the stochastic Fubini theorem are not met. The key feature to exploit is that the process has finite activity, i.e., $\\nu(E) < \\infty$.\n\nLet the jump times and locations of the PRM $N$ in $(0,1]\\times E$ be denoted by $\\{(T_k, Z_k)\\}$. Since the expected number of jumps in $(0,1]$ is $\\mathbb{E}[N((0,1], E)] = \\int_0^1 \\nu(E) \\mathrm{d}t = \\nu(E) < \\infty$, there are almost surely a finite number of such jumps. This allows for a pathwise representation of integrals with respect to $N$.\n\n**Analysis of $X_2$**\n\n$$X_2 := \\int_0^1\\int_E\\left(\\int_0^1 H(s,t,z)\\,\\mathrm{d}s\\right)\\,\\tilde{N}(\\mathrm{d}t,\\mathrm{d}z)$$\nFirst, we evaluate the inner deterministic integral over $s$. The integrand for $\\tilde{N}$ is $K(t,z) := \\int_0^1 H(s,t,z)\\,\\mathrm{d}s$.\n$$K(t,z) = \\int_0^1 h(s)\\,g(z)\\,\\mathbf{1}_{(0,1]}(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}s = g(z)\\mathbf{1}_{(0,1]}(t) \\int_0^1 s^{-1/2}\\,\\mathrm{d}s$$\nThe integral $\\int_0^1 s^{-1/2}\\,\\mathrm{d}s = [2s^{1/2}]_0^1 = 2$.\nThus, the integrand is $K(t,z) = 2g(z)\\mathbf{1}_{(0,1]}(t)$.\n$X_2$ becomes:\n$$X_2 = \\int_0^1\\int_E 2g(z) \\tilde{N}(\\mathrm{d}t,\\mathrm{d}z) = \\int_0^1\\int_E 2g(z) (N(\\mathrm{d}t,\\mathrm{d}z) - \\nu(\\mathrm{d}z)\\mathrm{d}t)$$\nUsing the pathwise representation $N(\\mathrm{d}t,\\mathrm{d}z) = \\sum_k \\delta_{(T_k, Z_k)}(\\mathrm{d}t, \\mathrm{d}z)$:\n$$X_2 = 2 \\sum_{k:\\,T_k\\le 1} g(Z_k) - \\int_0^1 \\left( \\int_E 2g(z)\\nu(\\mathrm{d}z) \\right) \\mathrm{d}t$$\n$$X_2 = 2\\left( \\sum_{k:\\,T_k\\le 1} g(Z_k) - \\int_E g(z)\\nu(\\mathrm{d}z) \\right)$$\nFor $X_2$ to be a well-defined integrable random variable, we need $\\mathbb{E}[|X_2|] < \\infty$. Given the expectation of a compensated integral is $0$, we check the integrability of the uncompensated part. By Campbell's Theorem:\n$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left|\\sum_{k:\\,T_k\\le 1} g(Z_k)\\right|\\right] \\le \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{k:\\,T_k\\le 1} |g(Z_k)|\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^1\\int_E |g(z)| N(\\mathrm{d}t,\\mathrm{d}z)\\right] = \\int_0^1\\int_E |g(z)|\\nu(\\mathrm{d}z)\\mathrm{d}t$$\nThis is equal to $\\int_E|g(z)|\\nu(\\mathrm{d}z)$, which is finite by hypothesis. The compensator term is a finite constant. Thus, $X_2$ is a well-defined integrable random variable.\nHowever, the associated process is not a square-integrable martingale because the square-integrability condition fails:\n$\\int_0^1\\int_E |K(t,z)|^2 \\nu(\\mathrm{d}z)\\mathrm{d}t = \\int_0^1\\int_E |2g(z)|^2 \\nu(\\mathrm{d}z)\\mathrm{d}t = 4\\int_E g(z)^2 \\nu(\\mathrm{d}z) = \\infty$.\n\n**Analysis of $X_1$**\n\n$$X_1 := \\int_0^1\\left(\\int_0^1\\int_E H(s,t,z)\\,\\tilde{N}(\\mathrm{d}t,\\mathrm{d}z)\\right)\\mathrm{d}s$$\nLet $Y(s)$ be the inner stochastic integral: $Y(s) = \\int_0^1\\int_E H(s,t,z)\\,\\tilde{N}(\\mathrm{d}t,\\mathrm{d}z)$.\nThe problem phrasing refers to \"the standard compensated Poisson integral definition as a square-integrable martingale\". This construction relies on the Itô isometry and requires the integrand to be square-integrable. For a fixed $s$, the integrand for $\\tilde{N}$ is $H(s,t,z) = h(s)g(z)\\mathbf{1}_{(0,1]}(t)$. The condition for $Y(s)$ to be in $L^2(\\mathbb{P})$ is:\n$$\\int_0^1\\int_E |H(s,t,z)|^2 \\nu(\\mathrm{d}z)\\mathrm{d}t < \\infty$$\nLet's evaluate this for $s \\in (0,1]$:\n$$\\int_0^1\\int_E |h(s)g(z)\\mathbf{1}_{(0,1]}(t)|^2 \\nu(\\mathrm{d}z)\\mathrm{d}t = h(s)^2 \\left(\\int_E g(z)^2\\nu(\\mathrm{d}z)\\right) \\left(\\int_0^1 \\mathrm{d}t\\right)$$\n$$= (s^{-1/2})^2 \\times (\\infty) \\times 1 = s^{-1} \\times \\infty = \\infty$$\nSince this condition fails for all $s \\in (0,1]$, the inner integral $Y(s)$ cannot be defined for any such $s$ within the framework of square-integrable martingales. Consequently, the outer integral $X_1 = \\int_0^1 Y(s)\\mathrm{d}s$ is not well-defined under this standard construction.\n\nIt is worth noting that a pathwise calculation is possible due to the compound Poisson structure:\n$Y(s) = h(s)\\left( \\sum_{k:\\,T_k\\le 1} g(Z_k) - \\int_E g(z)\\nu(\\mathrm{d}z) \\right)$.\nThen $X_1 = \\int_0^1 Y(s)\\mathrm{d}s = \\left( \\sum_{k:\\,T_k\\le 1} g(Z_k) - \\int_E g(z)\\nu(\\mathrm{d}z) \\right) \\int_0^1 h(s)\\mathrm{d}s = 2\\left( \\sum_{k:\\,T_k\\le 1} g(Z_k) - \\int_E g(z)\\nu(\\mathrm{d}z) \\right)$.\nThis shows that $X_1=X_2$ a.s. However, this derivation steps outside the \"standard definition as a square-integrable martingale\" by using a pathwise approach not applicable to general Lévy processes. The question probes this very distinction.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. In the above construction, $X_2$ is well-defined as an integrable random variable via the decomposition... By contrast, $X_1$ does not exist under the standard compensated Poisson integral definition as a square-integrable martingale...**\n\nThis statement aligns perfectly with our derivations.\n- The first part correctly identifies that $X_2$ is well-defined as an integrable random variable and provides the correct pathwise decomposition. The integral $\\int_0^1 h(s)\\mathrm{d}s = 2$.\nThe given formula: $\\sum_{k:\\,T_k\\le 1}\\left(\\int_0^1 h(s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s\\right)g(Z_k)\\;-\\;\\left(\\int_0^1 h(s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s\\right)\\int_E g(z)\\,\\nu(\\mathrm{d}z)$ becomes $2 \\sum_{k: T_k \\le 1} g(Z_k) - 2 \\int_E g(z)\\nu(\\mathrm{d}z)$, which is exactly our derived expression for $X_2$. We also showed it is integrable.\n- The second part correctly states that $X_1$ does not exist \"under the standard compensated Poisson integral definition as a square-integrable martingale\". As shown, the inner integral $Y(s)$ is not in $L^2(\\mathbb{P})$ for any $s \\in (0,1]$, so the construction fails. The reason given, that the total square-integrability condition for stochastic Fubini fails, is also correct and is the fundamental source of the problem.\nThis option correctly captures the subtleties of the problem.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Predictability of $H$ with respect to the filtration of $N$ is essential: if $H$ is optional but not predictable, then even if $\\mathbb{E}\\int_0^1\\int_E |H|^2\\,\\nu(\\mathrm{d}z)\\,\\mathrm{d}t<\\infty$, the compensated integral $\\int_0^1\\int_E H\\,\\tilde{N}$ is not a well-defined martingale in the usual sense, and the stochastic Fubini theorem cannot be applied.**\n\nThis is a correct statement of a fundamental principle in the theory of stochastic integration. The martingale property of stochastic integrals with respect to martingales (including compensated PRMs) hinges on the predictability of the integrand. Predictability ensures that the value of the integrand at time $t$ is determined by information available strictly before $t$, which prevents it from \"seeing\" the jump at $t$. If the integrand is merely optional, it can depend on the jump at $t$, and the resulting integral process is generally not a martingale (it acquires a correction term). Standard formulations of the stochastic Fubini theorem also explicitly require the integrand to be predictable.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. In the compound Poisson setting $\\nu(E)<\\infty$, boundedness of the integrand alone implies that compensated integrals are square-integrable and the interchange of deterministic and stochastic integrals is valid regardless of whether $H$ is predictable.**\n\nLet's dissect this. If an integrand $H$ is predictable and bounded, say $|H| \\le K$, then in the compound Poisson case ($\\nu(E) < \\infty$), the square-integrability condition holds: $\\mathbb{E}[\\int_0^1 \\int_E |H|^2 \\nu(\\mathrm{d}z)\\mathrm{d}t] \\le K^2 \\nu(E) < \\infty$. Similarly, the Fubini condition would hold for an integral over a finite product space. However, the claim is that this holds \"regardless of whether $H$ is predictable.\" As established in the analysis of option B, predictability is a crucial requirement. Dropping it invalidates the martingale property and the standard Fubini theorems.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. If interchange fails in the compensated setting, replacing $\\tilde{N}$ by the raw Poisson random measure $N$ fixes the issue because $\\int H\\,N$ is always well-defined for any measurable $H$, and classical (non-stochastic) Fubini applies without square-integrability assumptions.**\n\nThis statement contains a critical falsehood. The claim that \"$\\int H\\,N$ is always well-defined for any measurable $H$\" is incorrect. For the integral to be well-defined (as a pathwise sum), some integrability condition on $H$ is necessary. For example, if $H(t,z) = 1/t$, the sum $\\sum_k 1/T_k$ over jump times $T_k$ will diverge a.s. because the jump times of a Poisson process accumulate near $0$. While it is true that for the specific $H$ in this problem, the interchange for the raw measure $N$ is valid by applying the classical Fubini-Tonelli theorem pathwise (since $\\int_0^1\\int_0^1\\int_E |H(s,t,z)| \\nu(\\mathrm{d}z)\\mathrm{d}t\\mathrm{d}s < \\infty$), the universal claim \"for any measurable $H$\" makes the premise of the argument false.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "2971237"}]}
