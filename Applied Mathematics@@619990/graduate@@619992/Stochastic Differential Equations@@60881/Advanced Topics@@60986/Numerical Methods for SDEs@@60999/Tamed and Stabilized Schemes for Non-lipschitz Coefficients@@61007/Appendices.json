We need to show that this implies the numerical stability condition $2\\lambda + \\mu^2 < h\\lambda^2$ holds for all $h > 0$.\n\nGiven the problem's constraints, $\\lambda < 0$, which implies $\\lambda^2 > 0$. Also, $h > 0$. Therefore, the product $h\\lambda^2$ is strictly positive for any allowed $h$ and $\\lambda$.\nThe stability condition for the exact solution is that the quantity $2\\lambda + \\mu^2$ is strictly negative. Thus, we have the situation:\n$$\n\\underbrace{2\\lambda + \\mu^2}_{\\text{strictly negative}} < \\underbrace{h\\lambda^2}_{\\text{strictly positive}}\n$$\nA strictly negative number is always less than a strictly positive number. Therefore, if the condition for the mean-square stability of the exact solution ($2\\lambda + \\mu^2 < 0$) is satisfied, the condition for the mean-square stability of the numerical scheme ($2\\lambda + \\mu^2 < h\\lambda^2$) is automatically satisfied for all step sizes $h > 0$.\n\nThis demonstrates that the drift-implicit Euler-Maruyama scheme is mean-square A-stable for this linear test equation, as its region of mean-square stability contains the entire left half-plane domain of stability of the original SDE.
