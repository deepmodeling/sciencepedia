The derivation must be based on the provided foundational properties of Brownian motion and Tanaka's formula.\n\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the well-established theory of stochastic processes, is well-posed with a unique and meaningful solution, and is stated using objective, formal mathematical language.\n\nFirst, we will compute $\\mathbb{E}[|B_{t}|]$ by direct integration, using the given property that for a fixed time $t  0$, the random variable $B_{t}$ follows a Gaussian distribution with mean $0$ and variance $t$. This is denoted as $B_{t} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t)$.\n\nThe probability density function (PDF) of $B_{t}$ is given by:\n$$p(x; t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}}{2t}\\right)$$\nThe expectation of $|B_{t}|$ is defined as the integral of $|x|$ weighted by this PDF over the entire real line:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[|B_{t}|] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |x| p(x; t) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |x| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}}{2t}\\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}x$$\nThe integrand $|x| \\exp(-\\frac{x^{2}}{2t})$ is an even function of $x$.

The formula simplifies to:\n$$|B_{t}| = \\int_{0}^{t} \\mathrm{sgn}(B_{s}) \\, \\mathrm{d}B_{s} + L_{t}^{0}(B)$$\nNow, we take the expectation of both sides of this equation:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[|B_{t}|] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{t} \\mathrm{sgn}(B_{s}) \\, \\mathrm{d}B_{s}\\right] + \\mathbb{E}[L_{t}^{0}(B)]$$\nLet's analyze the expectation of the Itô integral term. The integrand is $\\phi_{s} = \\mathrm{sgn}(B_{s})$. This process is progressively measurable because the filtration of $B_s$ is standard. Furthermore, it is a bounded process, since $|\\mathrm{sgn}(B_{s})| \\leq 1$ for all $s \\geq 0$. The problem statement asserts that for any such bounded, progressively measurable process $\\{\\phi_{s}\\}$, the Itô integral $\\int_{0}^{t} \\phi_{s} \\, \\mathrm{d}B_{s}$ is a martingale with zero expectation.

The martingale part of $Y_t$ is given by the stochastic integral term involving $dX_s$, and from this we can determine the quadratic variation of $Y$. If $X = M+A$ is the canonical decomposition of $X$ into a continuous local martingale $M$ and a finite variation process $A$, then $dX_s = dM_s + dA_s$. The quadratic variation of $X$ is $\\langle X \\rangle_t = \\langle M \\rangle_t$. The martingale part of $Y_t$ is $\\int_0^t \\phi'(X_s) dM_s$.

Thus, $v(t,\\cdot)$ and $v_y(t,\\cdot)$ are continuous for $t0$.\n\nNow we analyze the properties of $u(t,x)$ using its relation to $v(t, y)$. Let $y=x-a$.\nFor $xa$, we have $y0$, so $|x-a|=x-a$ and $\\mathrm{sgn}(y)=1$.\n$u(t,x) = \\exp(\\theta(x-a) + \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 t) v(t, y)$.\n$u_x = \\theta \\exp(\\dots) v(t, y) + \\exp(\\dots) v_y(t, y)$.\n$u_{xx} = \\theta^2 \\exp(\\dots) v + 2\\theta \\exp(\\dots) v_y + \\exp(\\dots) v_{yy}$.\n$u_t = \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 u + \\exp(\\theta(x-a) + \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 t) v_t$.\nUsing $v_t = \\theta v_y + \\frac{1}{2}v_{yy}$ for $y0$:\n$u_t = \\exp(\\dots)[\\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 v + \\theta v_y + \\frac{1}{2} v_{yy}]$.\nComparing with $u_{xx}$:\n$\\frac{1}{2} u_{xx} = \\exp(\\dots)[\\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 v + \\theta v_y + \\frac{1}{2} v_{yy}] = u_t$.\nThis confirms $u_t = \\frac{1}{2}u_{xx}$ for $xa$. A similar calculation for $xa$ (where $|x-a|=-(x-a)$ and $\\mathrm{sgn}(y)=-1$) also yields $u_t = \\frac{1}{2}u_{xx}$.\n\nNext, we find the jump condition for the derivative $u_x$ at $x=a$.\n$u_x(t,a^+) = \\lim_{x\\to a^+} u_x(t,x) = \\lim_{y\\to 0^+} \\left[ \\theta \\exp(\\theta y + \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 t) v(t, y) + \\exp(\\theta y + \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 t) v_y(t, y) \\right]$.\nSince $v$ and $v_y$ are continuous at $y=0$:\n$u_x(t,a^+) = \\exp(\\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 t) \\left( \\theta v(t,0) + v_y(t,0) \\right)$.\n\nFor $xa$, we have $|x-a| = -(x-a) = a-x$.\n$u(t,x) = \\exp(\\theta(a-x) + \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 t) v(t, y)$.\n$u_x = -\\theta \\exp(\\dots) v(t,y) + \\exp(\\dots) v_y(t,y)$.\n$u_x(t,a^-) = \\lim_{x\\to a^-} u_x(t,x) = \\lim_{y\\to 0^-} \\left[ -\\theta \\exp(-\\theta y + \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 t) v(t, y) + \\exp(-\\theta y + \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 t) v_y(t, y) \\right]$.\n$u_x(t,a^-) = \\exp(\\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 t) \\left( -\\theta v(t,0) + v_y(t,0) \\right)$.\n\nNow we compute the difference:\n$$\nu_x(t,a^+) - u_x(t,a^-) = \\exp(\\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 t) \\left[ (\\theta v(t,0) + v_y(t,0)) - (-\\theta v(t,0) + v_y(t,0)) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nu_x(t,a^+) - u_x(t,a^-) = \\exp(\\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 t) (2\\theta v(t,0))\n$$\nThe function $u(t,x)$ is continuous at $x=a$. At $x=a$ (i.e., $y=0$):\n$$\nu(t,a) = \\exp(\\theta|a-a| + \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 t) v(t, 0) = \\exp(\\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 t) v(t,0)\n$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for the jump in the derivative:\n$$\nu_x(t,a^+) - u_x(t,a^-) = 2\\theta u(t,a)\n$$\nThis matches the form given in the problem, $u_x(t,a^{+}) - u_x(t,a^{-}) = C u(t,a)$. By comparison, we identify the constant $C$.\n$$\nC = 2\\theta\n$$\n\nThe full boundary value problem satisfied by $u(t,x)$ is:\n1.  PDE: $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$ for $x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{a\\}$.\n2.
