Let $F_n \\in \\mathcal{S}$. We can write $F_n = f_n(W(h_{n,1}), \\dots, W(h_{n,d_n}))$ for some $f_n \\in C_b^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{d_n})$. Then $g(F_n) = (g \\circ f_n)(W(h_{n,1}), \\dots, W(h_{n,d_n}))$. While $g \\circ f_n$ is not necessarily in $C_b^{\\infty}$, it is in $C_b^1$, and the chain rule for the Malliavin derivative applies, yielding:\n$$ D_t(g(F_n)) = g'(F_n) D_t F_n $$\nThis is a fundamental property of the Malliavin derivative on such functionals.\n\nTo demonstrate that $(g(F_n))$ is Cauchy in $\\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$, we must show that $\\|g(F_n) - g(F_m)\\|_{1,2}^2 \\to 0$ as $n,m \\to \\infty$.

Let $M_{g'} = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} |g'(x)| < \\infty$. By the Mean Value Theorem, $g$ is Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant $M_{g'}$.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[(g(F_n) - g(F_m))^2] \\le \\mathbb{E}[(M_{g'} |F_n - F_m|)^2] = M_{g'}^2 \\mathbb{E}[(F_n - F_m)^2] $$\nSince $(F_n)$ is Cauchy in $L^2(\\Omega)$, $\\mathbb{E}[(F_n - F_m)^2] \\to 0$ as $n, m \\to \\infty$. Thus, the first term vanishes.\n\nFor the second term, we use the chain rule $D_t(g(F_k)) = g'(F_k)D_t F_k$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^T |g'(F_n)D_t F_n - g'(F_m)D_t F_m|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}t\\right] $$\nWe use the identity $a-b = (a-c) + (c-b)$ and the inequality $(x+y)^2 \\le 2x^2 + 2y^2$:\n$$ |g'(F_n)D_t F_n - g'(F_m)D_t F_m|^2 = |g'(F_n)(D_t F_n - D_t F_m) + (g'(F_n) - g'(F_m))D_t F_m|^2 $$\n$$ \\le 2|g'(F_n)|^2 |D_t F_n - D_t F_m|^2 + 2|g'(F_n) - g'(F_m)|^2 |D_t F_m|^2 $$\nIntegrating and taking the expectation:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^T |D_t(g(F_n)) - D_t(g(F_m))|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}t\\right] \\le 2\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^T |g'(F_n)|^2 |D_t F_n - D_t F_m|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}t\\right] + 2\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^T |g'(F_n) - g'(F_m)|^2 |D_t F_m|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}t\\right] $$\nLet's bound these two new terms.\nFor the first, using $|g'(F_n)| \\le M_{g'}$:\n$$ 2\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^T |g'(F_n)|^2 |D_t F_n - D_t F_m|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}t\\right] \\le 2M_{g'}^2 \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^T |D_t F_n - D_t F_m|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}t\\right] $$\nThis term goes to $0$ as $n,m \\to \\infty$ because $(F_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence with respect to the derivative part of the $\\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$ norm.\n\nFor the second term, $2\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^T |g'(F_n) - g'(F_m)|^2 |D_t F_m|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}t\\right]$, note that since $(F_k)_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$, it is a bounded sequence, so $\\sup_m \\|F_m\\|_{1,2} < C$ for some constant $C < \\infty$. This implies $\\sup_m \\mathbb{E}[\\int_0^T |D_t F_m|^2 \\mathrm{d}t] < \\infty$. Also, since $F_n \\to F$ and $F_m \\to F$ in $L^2(\\Omega)$, we have $F_n - F_m \\to 0$ in $L^2(\\Omega)$. By continuity of $g'$, it follows that $g'(F_n) - g'(F_m) \\to 0$ in probability. The term $|g'(F_n)-g'(F_m)|^2$ is bounded by $(2M_{g'})^2$. The sequence of random variables $\\int_0^T |D_t F_m|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}t$ is uniformly integrable. By a variation of the dominated convergence theorem (or Vitali convergence), the expectation converges to $0$. Thus, the second term vanishes as $n,m\\to\\infty$.\n\nBoth terms of the $\\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$ norm difference go to zero, so $(g(F_n))$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$. Since $\\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$ is a complete space (a Hilbert space), the sequence $(g(F_n))$ converges to a limit in $\\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$. Let's identify this limit. The convergence in $\\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$ implies convergence in $L^2(\\Omega)$. Since $F_n \\to F$ in $L^2(\\Omega)$ and $g$ is Lipschitz continuous, $g(F_n) \\to g(F)$ in $L^2(\\Omega)$. By the uniqueness of limits in $L^2(\\Omega)$, the limit of $(g(F_n))$ must be $g(F)$. Therefore, $g(F) \\in \\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$.\n\nNow we determine the derivative $D_t(g(F))$. The operator $D$ is closable. This means if a sequence $(Y_n)$ in $\\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$ converges to $Y$ in $L^2(\\Omega)$, and the sequence of derivatives $(D Y_n)$ converges to a limit $Z$ in $L^2(\\Omega \\times [0,T])$, then $Y \\in \\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$ and $D Y = Z$.\nWe have $g(F_n) \\to g(F)$ in $\\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$, which implies $g(F_n) \\to g(F)$ in $L^2(\\Omega)$ and $D(g(F_n)) \\to D(g(F))$ in $L^2(\\Omega \\times [0,T])$.\nWe also know $D_t(g(F_n)) = g'(F_n) D_t F_n$. We need to find the limit of this sequence in $L^2(\\Omega \\times [0,T])$. Let's show it converges to $g'(F)D_t F$.\nConsider the norm of the difference:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^T |g'(F_n)D_t F_n - g'(F)D_t F|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}t\\right] $$\nUsing the same technique as before:\n$$ \\le 2\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^T |g'(F_n)|^2|D_t F_n - D_t F|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}t\\right] + 2\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^T |g'(F_n) - g'(F)|^2|D_t F|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}t\\right] $$\nThe first term is bounded by $2M_{g'}^2 \\mathbb{E}[\\int_0^T |D_t F_n - D_t F|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}t]$, which converges to $0$ as $n\\to\\infty$ because $F_n \\to F$ in $\\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$.\nFor the second term, $2\\mathbb{E}[\\int_0^T |g'(F_n) - g'(F)|^2|D_t F|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}t]$, we know $F_n \\to F$ in $L^2(\\Omega)$, so there is a subsequence that converges almost surely. By continuity of $g'$, $g'(F_n) \\to g'(F)$ in probability. The integrand is dominated by $(2M_{g'})^2|D_t F|^2$, which is integrable over $\\Omega \\times [0,T]$ because $F \\in \\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$. By the dominated convergence theorem, this term also converges to $0$.\nSo, $g'(F_n) D F_n \\to g'(F) D F$ in $L^2(\\Omega \\times [0,T])$. By the closability of $D$, we have:\n$$ D_t(g(F)) = g'(F) D_t F $$\nThis is the desired expression for the Malliavin derivative.\n\nTo verify that $g(F)$ is indeed in $\\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$, we must check the finiteness of the norm $\\|g(F)\\|_{1,2}^2$.\n1. $\\mathbb{E}[g(F)^2]$: Since $g \\in C_b^1(\\mathbb{R})$, $g$ is bounded. Let $|g(x)| \\le M_g < \\infty$. Then $\\mathbb{E}[g(F)^2] \\le M_g^2 < \\infty$.\n2. $\\mathbb{E}[\\int_0^T |D_t(g(F))|^2 \\mathrm{d}t]$: Using our derived formula, this is $\\mathbb{E}[\\int_0^T |g'(F) D_t F|^2 \\mathrm{d}t]$. Since $g \\in C_b^1(\\mathbb{R})$, $g'$ is bounded by $M_{g'}$.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^T |g'(F)|^2 |D_t F|^2 \\mathrm{d}t\\right] \\le M_{g'}^2 \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^T |D_t F|^2 \\mathrm{d}t\\right] $$\nSince $F \\in \\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$, the term $\\mathbb{E}[\\int_0^T |D_t F|^2 \\mathrm{d}t]$ is finite. Thus, the second part of the norm is also finite. Both conditions are satisfied, confirming $g(F) \\in \\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$.\n\nFinally, the Clark-Ocone representation formula expresses an $\\mathcal{F}_T$-measurable random variable $Y \\in \\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$ as a stochastic integral: $Y = \\mathbb{E}[Y] + \\int_0^T \\mathbb{E}[D_s Y | \\mathcal{F}_s] \\mathrm{d}W_s$. The application of this formula requires knowledge of the Malliavin derivative $D_s Y$. By proving that $g(F) \\in \\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$ and explicitly identifying its Malliavin derivative as $D_t(g(F)) = g'(F)D_t F$, we have obtained the necessary component to construct the integrand $\\mathbb{E}[g'(F)D_t F | \\mathcal{F}_t]$ in the Clark-Ocone representation for $g(F)$.

The solution process involves two main steps: first, computing the Malliavin derivative $D_t F$, and second, evaluating its conditional expectation with respect to the filtration $\\mathcal{F}_t$.\n\n**Step 1: Compute the Malliavin derivative $D_t F$**\n\nThe random variable is given by $F = \\varphi(W_T)$. We apply the chain rule for the Malliavin derivative. For a function $g \\in C^1(\\mathbb{R})$ and a random variable $G$ in the domain of the Malliavin derivative, the chain rule states that $D_t(g(G)) = g'(G) D_t G$. In our case, $g = \\varphi$ and $G = W_T$. The function $\\varphi$ is in $C_b^1(\\mathbb{R})$, satisfying the required smoothness. The random variable $W_T$ is in the domain of the Malliavin derivative.\n\nApplying the chain rule, we get:\n$$\nD_t F = D_t(\\varphi(W_T)) = \\varphi'(W_T) \\cdot D_t W_T\n$$\nThe Malliavin derivative of the Brownian motion $W_s$ at time $t$ is given by the indicator function $D_t W_s = \\mathbb{I}_{[0,s]}(t)$. For our specific case with $s=T$, this means:\n$$\nD_t W_T = \\mathbb{I}_{[0,T]}(t) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } 0 \\le t \\le T \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } t > T \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that we are interested in $t \\in [0, T]$. For such $t$, we have $D_t W_T = 1$. Therefore, the Malliavin derivative of $F$ is:\n$$\nD_t F = \\varphi'(W_T) \\quad \\text{for } t \\in [0, T]\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Compute the conditional expectation $\\mathbb{E}[D_t F | \\mathcal{F}_t]$**\n\nNow we must compute the conditional expectation of this result with respect to the filtration $\\mathcal{F}_t$.\n$$\n\\phi_t = \\mathbb{E}[D_t F | \\mathcal{F}_t] = \\mathbb{E}[\\varphi'(W_T) | \\mathcal{F}_t]\n$$\nTo evaluate this conditional expectation for $t \\in [0,T]$, we use the tower property of conditional expectation and the properties of Brownian motion. We decompose the Brownian path at time $T$ as the sum of its value at time $t$ and the subsequent increment:\n$$\nW_T = W_t + (W_T - W_t)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression, we get:\n$$\n\\phi_t = \\mathbb{E}[\\varphi'(W_t + (W_T - W_t)) | \\mathcal{F}_t]\n$$\nWe now leverage two fundamental properties of Brownian motion:\n1.  The value of the Brownian motion at time $t$, $W_t$, is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable.\n2.  The increment $(W_T - W_t)$ is independent of the filtration $\\mathcal{F}_t$ for $t \\le T$.\n\nUsing these properties, we can \"take out what is known\" from the conditional expectation. This means we can treat $W_t$ as a constant value within the expectation, and the expectation is then taken over the random variable $(W_T - W_t)$, which is independent of the conditioning sigma-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_t$.\nLet $x$ be a placeholder for the value of $W_t$. We can define an auxiliary function $G(x)$ as:\n$$\nG(x) := \\mathbb{E}[\\varphi'(x + (W_T - W_t))]\n$$\nThen, $\\phi_t = G(W_t)$.\n\nThe increment $(W_T - W_t)$ is a Gaussian random variable with mean $0$ and variance $T-t$. Its distribution is identical to that of $W_{T-t}$. Let $s = T-t$. We can write:\n$$\nG(x) = \\mathbb{E}[\\varphi'(x + W_{T-t})] = \\mathbb{E}[\\varphi'(x + W_s)]\n$$\nThis expression matches the definition of the heat semigroup $(P_s f)(x)$ given in the problem statement, where we identify the function $f$ with $\\varphi'$ and the time parameter $s$ with $T-t$.\n$$\n(P_s \\varphi')(x) = \\mathbb{E}[\\varphi'(x + W_s)]\n$$\nTherefore, we have:\n$$\nG(x) = (P_{T-t} \\varphi')(x)\n$$\nFinally, substituting $x = W_t$ back into the expression for $\\phi_t$, we obtain the Clark–Ocone integrand:\n$$\n\\phi_t = G(W_t) = (P_{T-t} \\varphi')(W_t)\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the integrand, given as a function of $t$ and $W_t$, and expressed in terms of the heat semigroup acting on the derivative of $\\varphi$, as required. The condition $\\varphi \\in C_b^1(\\mathbb{R})$ is crucial, as it ensures $\\varphi'$ is bounded and continuous, so the expectation defining the heat semigroup is well-defined.\nFor $t=T$, the expression becomes $(P_0 \\varphi')(W_T)$.

The Clark-Ocone formula states that for a suitable functional $F$, its Itô representation is given by $F = \\mathbb{E}[F] + \\int_{0}^{T} g_{t} dW_{t}$, where the integrand is $g_{t} = \\mathbb{E}[D_{t}F | \\mathcal{F}_{t}]$. The problem guides us through a three-step procedure involving a smooth approximation of $F$.\n\nThe function $x \\mapsto \\max(x,0)$ is not differentiable, so we cannot directly apply the chain rule of Malliavin calculus. We proceed as directed.\n\n1.  Construction of a smooth approximation and $L^{2}$ convergence.\nThe function to be approximated is $x^{+} = \\max(x,0)$. We can express this as $x^{+} = \\frac{1}{2}(x + |x|)$. The non-smoothness comes from the absolute value function $|x| = \\sqrt{x^{2}}$. A standard way to smoothen this is to introduce a small positive parameter $\\epsilon$.\nWe define the family of functions $\\{f_{\\epsilon}\\}_{\\epsilon>0}$ by\n$$f_{\\epsilon}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(x + \\sqrt{x^{2} + \\epsilon^{2}})$$\nFor any fixed $\\epsilon > 0$, the term under the square root is strictly positive, so $f_{\\epsilon}$ is infinitely differentiable ($C^{\\infty}$) on $\\mathbb{R}$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0$, we have $\\sqrt{x^{2} + \\epsilon^{2}} \\to \\sqrt{x^{2}} = |x|$, so $f_{\\epsilon}(x) \\to \\frac{1}{2}(x + |x|) = x^{+}$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This shows pointwise convergence.\nThe first derivative of $f_{\\epsilon}$ is:\n$$f_{\\epsilon}'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(x + \\sqrt{x^{2} + \\epsilon^{2}}) \\right] = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\frac{2x}{2\\sqrt{x^{2} + \\epsilon^{2}}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^{2} + \\epsilon^{2}}}\\right)$$\nFor $\\epsilon > 0$, $f_{\\epsilon}'(x)$ is a continuous function of $x$. To check if it is bounded, we analyze the term $\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^{2} + \\epsilon^{2}}}$. Its absolute value is $|\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^{2} + \\epsilon^{2}}}| = \\frac{|x|}{\\sqrt{x^{2} + \\epsilon^{2}}} \\le \\frac{|x|}{\\sqrt{x^{2}}} = 1$ for $x \\ne 0$. The inequality is strict for all $x$. Thus, $-1  \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^{2} + \\epsilon^{2}}}  1$, which implies $0  1 + \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^{2} + \\epsilon^{2}}}  2$. Therefore, $0  f_{\\epsilon}'(x)  1$. The derivative is continuous and bounded for each $\\epsilon > 0$.\n\nTo show that $f_{\\epsilon}(W_{T}) \\to F$ in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$, we must show $\\mathbb{E}\\left[|f_{\\epsilon}(W_{T}) - W_{T}^{+}|^{2}\\right] \\to 0$ as $\\epsilon \\to 0$. Let's examine the difference $|f_{\\epsilon}(x) - x^{+}|$:\n$$|f_{\\epsilon}(x) - x^{+}| = \\left|\\frac{1}{2}(x + \\sqrt{x^{2} + \\epsilon^{2}}) - \\frac{1}{2}(x + |x|)\\right| = \\frac{1}{2}|\\sqrt{x^{2} + \\epsilon^{2}} - |x||$$\nMultiplying by the conjugate, we get:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\left| \\frac{(\\sqrt{x^{2} + \\epsilon^{2}} - |x|)(\\sqrt{x^{2} + \\epsilon^{2}} + |x|)}{\\sqrt{x^{2} + \\epsilon^{2}} + |x|} \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{|x^{2} + \\epsilon^{2} - x^{2}|}{\\sqrt{x^{2} + \\epsilon^{2}} + |x|} = \\frac{\\epsilon^{2}}{2(\\sqrt{x^{2} + \\epsilon^{2}} + |x|)}$$\nSince $\\sqrt{x^{2} + \\epsilon^{2}} \\ge \\sqrt{\\epsilon^{2}} = \\epsilon$ and $|x| \\ge 0$, the denominator is at least $\\epsilon$.\n$$|f_{\\epsilon}(x) - x^{+}| \\le \\frac{\\epsilon^{2}}{2\\epsilon} = \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}$$\nThis bound is uniform in $x$. Thus, applied to $W_{T}$, we have $|f_{\\epsilon}(W_{T}) - W_{T}^{+}| \\le \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}$ for all $\\omega \\in \\Omega$.\nThe $L^{2}$ norm of the difference is then bounded by:\n$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[|f_{\\epsilon}(W_{T}) - W_{T}^{+}|^{2}\\right] \\le \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{2}\\right)^{2}\\right] = \\frac{\\epsilon^{2}}{4}$$\nAs $\\epsilon \\to 0$, $\\frac{\\epsilon^{2}}{4} \\to 0$, which proves that $f_{\\epsilon}(W_{T}) \\to W_{T}^{+}$ in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$.\n\n2.  Computation of the Malliavin derivative.\nThe Malliavin derivative of a functional of the form $f(W_{T})$, where $f$ is continuously differentiable with a bounded derivative, is given by the chain rule: $D_{t}(f(W_{T})) = f'(W_{T}) D_{t}W_{T}$. The Malliavin derivative of $W_{T} = \\int_{0}^{T} 1 \\, dW_{s}$ is $D_{t}W_{T} = 1$ for $t \\in [0,T]$.\nApplying this to our approximation $F_{\\epsilon} = f_{\\epsilon}(W_{T})$, we get:\n$$D_{t}(f_{\\epsilon}(W_{T})) = f_{\\epsilon}'(W_{T})$$\nfor $t \\in [0,T]$. Substituting the expression for $f_{\\epsilon}'(x)$ from Step 1:\n$$D_{t}(f_{\\epsilon}(W_{T})) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\frac{W_{T}}{\\sqrt{W_{T}^{2} + \\epsilon^{2}}}\\right)$$\n\n3.  Conditional expectation and limiting expression.\nThe integrand in the Clark-Ocone representation for $F$ is $g_{t} = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\mathbb{E}[D_{t}(f_{\\epsilon}(W_{T})) | \\mathcal{F}_{t}]$. Let's first compute the conditional expectation for fixed $\\epsilon$:\n$$g_{t}^{\\epsilon} = \\mathbb{E}[D_{t}(f_{\\epsilon}(W_{T})) | \\mathcal{F}_{t}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\frac{W_{T}}{\\sqrt{W_{T}^{2} + \\epsilon^{2}}}\\right) \\bigg| \\mathcal{F}_{t}\\right]$$\nBy linearity of conditional expectation:\n$$g_{t}^{\\epsilon} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{W_{T}}{\\sqrt{W_{T}^{2} + \\epsilon^{2}}} \\bigg| \\mathcal{F}_{t}\\right]$$\nThe random variable inside the expectation, $h_{\\epsilon}(W_{T}) = \\frac{W_{T}}{\\sqrt{W_{T}^{2} + \\epsilon^{2}}}$, is bounded in absolute value by $1$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0$, $h_{\\epsilon}(x) \\to \\text{sgn}(x)$ for $x \\ne 0$. Since $\\mathbb{P}(W_{T}=0)=0$, this convergence happens almost surely. By the bounded convergence theorem for conditional expectations, we can interchange the limit and the expectation:\n$$g_{t} = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} g_{t}^{\\epsilon} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\frac{W_{T}}{\\sqrt{W_{T}^{2} + \\epsilon^{2}}} \\bigg| \\mathcal{F}_{t}\\right] = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\mathbb{E}[\\text{sgn}(W_{T}) | \\mathcal{F}_{t}]\\right)$$\nNow we compute $\\mathbb{E}[\\text{sgn}(W_{T}) | \\mathcal{F}_{t}]$. Note that $\\text{sgn}(x) = \\mathbf{1}_{x>0} - \\mathbf{1}_{x0}$.\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\text{sgn}(W_{T}) | \\mathcal{F}_{t}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{1}_{W_{T}>0} | \\mathcal{F}_{t}] - \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{1}_{W_{T}0} | \\mathcal{F}_{t}] = \\mathbb{P}(W_{T}>0 | \\mathcal{F}_{t}) - \\mathbb{P}(W_{T}0 | \\mathcal{F}_{t})$$\nWe decompose $W_{T}$ as $W_{T} = W_{t} + (W_{T} - W_{t})$. Given $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$, $W_{t}$ is a known value, and the increment $W_{T} - W_{t}$ is independent of $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$ and follows a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $T-t$. So, $W_{T} - W_{t} \\sim N(0, T-t)$.\nWe have, for $t  T$:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(W_{T} > 0 | \\mathcal{F}_{t}) = \\mathbb{P}(W_{t} + (W_{T} - W_{t}) > 0 | \\mathcal{F}_{t}) = \\mathbb{P}(W_{T} - W_{t} > -W_{t})$$\nLet $Z \\sim N(0,1)$ be a standard normal variable. Then $W_{T} - W_{t}$ has the same distribution as $\\sqrt{T-t} Z$.\n$$\\mathbb{P}(\\sqrt{T-t}Z > -W_{t}) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(Z > -\\frac{W_{t}}{\\sqrt{T-t}}\\right)$$\nLet $\\Phi(\\cdot)$ be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, $\\Phi(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} \\exp(-\\frac{y^{2}}{2}) dy$.\nThe probability is $1 - \\Phi\\left(-\\frac{W_{t}}{\\sqrt{T-t}}\\right)$. Using the symmetry property $\\Phi(-z) = 1 - \\Phi(z)$, we get:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(W_{T} > 0 | \\mathcal{F}_{t}) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{W_{t}}{\\sqrt{T-t}}\\right)$$\nSimilarly, $\\mathbb{P}(W_{T}  0 | \\mathcal{F}_{t}) = \\mathbb{P}(Z  -\\frac{W_{t}}{\\sqrt{T-t}}) = \\Phi(-\\frac{W_{t}}{\\sqrt{T-t}}) = 1 - \\Phi(\\frac{W_{t}}{\\sqrt{T-t}})$.\nTherefore,\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\text{sgn}(W_{T}) | \\mathcal{F}_{t}] = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{W_{t}}{\\sqrt{T-t}}\\right) - \\left(1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{W_{t}}{\\sqrt{T-t}}\\right)\\right) = 2\\Phi\\left(\\frac{W_{t}}{\\sqrt{T-t}}\\right) - 1$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $g_{t}$:\n$$g_{t} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\left(2\\Phi\\left(\\frac{W_{t}}{\\sqrt{T-t}}\\right) - 1\\right)\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(2\\Phi\\left(\\frac{W_{t}}{\\sqrt{T-t}}\\right)\\right) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{W_{t}}{\\sqrt{T-t}}\\right)$$\nThe expression is valid for $t \\in [0,T)$.\n\nThe final result for the predictable integrand is the CDF of the standard normal distribution evaluated at $\\frac{W_{t}}{\\sqrt{T-t}}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\Phi\\left(\\frac{W_{t}}{\\sqrt{T-t}}\\right)}$$", "id": "3000571"}]}
