We first compute the integral $\\int_{0}^{1} |f(x)g(x)|\\,\\mathrm{d}x$ and the norm $\\|f\\|_{L^{1}(\\mathbb{P})}$.\n    The functions are given as $f(x) = 1$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$ and\n    $$\n    g(x)=\\begin{cases}\n    k, & \\text{if } x=q_{k} \\text{ for some } k\\in\\mathbb{N},\\\\\n    1, & \\text{if } x\\in[0,1]\\setminus\\{q_{k}:k\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}.\n    \\end{cases}\n    $$\n    Since $f(x)=1$ and $g(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$, the integrand is $|f(x)g(x)| = |1 \\cdot g(x)| = g(x)$.\n    The integral is $\\int_{0}^{1} g(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x$. The function $g(x)$ is equal to $1$ for all $x$ in the set of irrational numbers in $[0,1]$, and also for $x=0$. The set of points where $g(x) \\neq 1$ is the set of rational numbers in $(0,1]$, denoted by $\\{q_k : k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. This is a countable set. In Lebesgue measure theory, any countable subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ has measure zero. Let $Q = \\{q_k : k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. Then $\\mathbb{P}(Q) = 0$.\n    A fundamental property of the Lebesgue integral is that if two functions are equal almost everywhere (i.e., they differ only on a set of measure zero), their integrals are identical. The function $g(x)$ is equal to the constant function $h(x)=1$ almost everywhere on $[0,1]$.\n    Therefore,\n    $$\n    \\int_{0}^{1} |f(x)g(x)|\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{0}^{1} g(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{0}^{1} 1\\,\\mathrm{d}x = [x]_{0}^{1} = 1.\n    $$\n    Next, we compute $\\|f\\|_{L^{1}(\\mathbb{P})}$.

We compute the pointwise supremum $S:=\\sup_{x\\in[0,1]} |g(x)|$ and explain its inadequacy.\n    The values taken by the function $g(x)$ are $1$ (for irrational $x$) and the set of natural numbers $\\{k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ (for rational $x=q_k$). The set of all values is $\\{1\\} \\cup \\mathbb{N} = \\mathbb{N}$. Since $g(x)$ is always positive, $|g(x)|=g(x)$.\n    The pointwise supremum is the supremum over the set of values the function can take.\n    $$\n    S = \\sup_{x\\in[0,1]} g(x) = \\sup(\\mathbb{N}) = \\sup\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\} = \\infty.\n    $$\n    The space $L^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{P})$ consists of equivalence classes of measurable functions, where two functions are considered equivalent if they are equal almost everywhere. A norm on this space must assign a single, finite value to each equivalence class.\n    Let $[g]$ be the equivalence class of $g$. Let us consider another function, $\\tilde{g}(x) = 1$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$. The set of points where $g(x) \\neq \\tilde{g}(x)$ is the set of rational numbers $\\{q_k : k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, which has measure zero. Thus, $g$ and $\\tilde{g}$ belong to the same equivalence class in $L^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{P})$.\n    However, the pointwise supremum of $|\\tilde{g}(x)|$ is\n    $$\n    \\sup_{x\\in[0,1]} |\\tilde{g}(x)| = \\sup_{x\\in[0,1]} 1 = 1.\n    $$\n    Since we found two different values, $S = \\infty$ and $\\sup|\\tilde{g}|=1$, for two different representatives of the same equivalence class $[g]$, the pointwise supremum is not a well-defined operation on the elements of $L^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{P})$. A norm must be uniquely defined for each element of the vector space.\n\n3.  We compute the essential supremum $\\operatorname{ess\\,sup}_{x\\in[0,1]} |g(x)|$.\n    The essential supremum of a measurable function $h$ on a measure space $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\mathbb{P})$ is defined as:\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{ess\\,sup} |h| = \\inf\\{ M \\in [0, \\infty] \\mid \\mathbb{P}(\\{x \\in \\Omega \\mid |h(x)| > M\\}) = 0 \\}.\n    $$\n    For our function $g$, we have $|g(x)|=g(x)$. Let us evaluate the condition for different values of $M$.\n    If we choose $M=1$, the set in question is $\\{x \\in [0,1] \\mid g(x) > 1\\}$. From the definition of $g(x)$, this condition holds if and only if $x=q_k$ for some integer $k \\geq 2$. So, $\\{x \\in [0,1] \\mid g(x) > 1\\} = \\{q_2, q_3, q_4, \\ldots\\}$. This is a countable set, and its Lebesgue measure is $\\mathbb{P}(\\{q_2, q_3, \\ldots\\}) = 0$.\n    Since the condition is met for $M=1$, the essential supremum must be less than or equal to $1$.\n    Now, consider any $M < 1$. The set is $\\{x \\in [0,1] \\mid g(x) > M\\}$. This set contains all $x$ for which $g(x)=1$, which is the set of irrational numbers in $[0,1]$ and $x=0$. The measure of the set of irrational numbers in $[0,1]$ is $1$. So, for any $M < 1$, $\\mathbb{P}(\\{x \\in [0,1] \\mid g(x) > M\\}) \\geq 1$. In fact, since all values of $g(x)$ are $\\geq 1$, for $M<1$, the set $\\{x \\mid g(x) > M\\}$ is the entire interval $[0,1]$, which has measure $1$. Since $1 \\neq 0$, no value $M<1$ satisfies the condition.\n    The set of all $M$ such that $\\mathbb{P}(\\{x \\mid g(x)>M\\})=0$ is the interval $[1,\\infty]$. The infimum of this set is $1$.\n    Therefore,\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{ess\\,sup}_{x\\in[0,1]} |g(x)| = \\|g\\|_{L^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{P})} = 1.\n    $$\n\n4.  We determine the smallest constant $C\\in[0,\\infty]$ such that the given inequality holds.\n    The inequality is:\n    $$\n    \\int_{0}^{1} |f(x)g(x)|\\,\\mathrm{d}x \\leq C\\,\\|f\\|_{L^{1}(\\mathbb{P})}.\n    $$\n    This inequality involves the specific functions $f(x)=1$ and the given $g(x)$, not arbitrary functions. We must find the smallest $C$ for which this single statement is true.\n    From part 1, we calculated the values of the two sides of the inequality:\n    - Left-hand side: $\\int_{0}^{1} |f(x)g(x)|\\,\\mathrm{d}x = 1$.\n    - Term on the right-hand side: $\\|f\\|_{L^{1}(\\mathbb{P})} = 1$.\n    Substituting these values into the inequality, we get:\n    $$\n    1 \\leq C \\cdot 1\n    $$\n    This simplifies to $C \\geq 1$. We are asked for the smallest constant $C \\in [0, \\infty]$ that satisfies this condition. The set of all valid $C$ is the interval $[1, \\infty)$. The smallest value in this set is $1$.\n    Thus, the minimal constant is $C=1$. It is noteworthy that this constant is equal to the true $L^{\\infty}$-norm of $g$, demonstrating that $\\|g\\|_{L^{\\infty}}$ is the correct value for the sharp constant in the Hölder-type inequality $\\|fg\\|_{L^1} \\le \\|g\\|_{L^\\infty} \\|f\\|_{L^1}$.

All terms are defined, and the tasks are specific and solvable through direct application of established mathematical definitions and theorems.\n\nWe will address the three tasks in sequence before providing the final numerical evaluation.\n\nFirst, we establish the integrability properties of the functions $k(t)$ and $f(t)$.\n\n1. To determine if $k \\in L^{1}((0,\\infty))$, we must evaluate its $L^{1}$ norm, which is defined as $\\|k\\|_{L^1} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |k(t)| dt$.\nThe kernel is given by $k(t) = \\frac{1}{t} \\mathbf{1}_{(0,1)}(t)$. On the interval $(0, \\infty)$, $t$ is positive, so $|k(t)| = k(t)$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\|k\\|_{L^1} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{t} \\mathbf{1}_{(0,1)}(t) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1}{t} \\, dt\n$$\nThis is an improper integral due to the singularity at $t=0$. We evaluate it as a limit:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1}{t} \\, dt = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}} \\int_{\\epsilon}^{1} \\frac{1}{t} \\, dt = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}} [\\ln(t)]_{\\epsilon}^{1} = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}} (\\ln(1) - \\ln(\\epsilon)) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}} (-\\ln(\\epsilon))\n$$\nAs $\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}$, $\\ln(\\epsilon) \\to -\\infty$, and therefore $-\\ln(\\epsilon) \\to +\\infty$. Since the integral diverges to infinity, the $L^{1}$ norm of $k$ is infinite. Thus, $k \\notin L^{1}((0,\\infty))$.\n\nNext, we show that $f \\in L^{p}((0,\\infty))$ for every $p \\in [1,\\infty]$. The function is $f(t) = \\mathbf{1}_{(0,1)}(t)$.\nFor $p \\in [1, \\infty)$, the $p$-th power of the $L^{p}$ norm is:\n$$\n\\|f\\|_{L^p}^p = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |f(t)|^p \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |\\mathbf{1}_{(0,1)}(t)|^p \\, dt\n$$\nSince the indicator function takes values $0$ or $1$, its absolute value raised to any power $p \\ge 1$ is the function itself.\n$$\n\\|f\\|_{L^p}^p = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\mathbf{1}_{(0,1)}(t) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{1} 1 \\, dt = [t]_{0}^{1} = 1\n$$\nTherefore, $\\|f\\|_{L^p} = (1)^{1/p} = 1$ for all $p \\in [1, \\infty)$.\nFor $p=\\infty$, the $L^{\\infty}$ norm is the essential supremum:\n$$\n\\|f\\|_{L^\\infty} = \\mathrm{ess\\,sup}_{t \\in (0,\\infty)} |f(t)| = \\mathrm{ess\\,sup}_{t \\in (0,\\infty)} |\\mathbf{1}_{(0,1)}(t)| = 1\n$$\nSince the norm is finite (equal to $1$) for all $p \\in [1, \\infty]$, we have established that $f \\in L^{p}((0,\\infty))$ for all such $p$.\n\nSecond, we compute the convolution $h(t) = (k * f)(t)$ for $t \\in (1,2)$. The definition is:\n$$\nh(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} k(s) f(t - s) \\, ds = \\int_{0}^{t} \\left(\\frac{1}{s} \\mathbf{1}_{(0,1)}(s)\\right) \\left(\\mathbf{1}_{(0,1)}(t-s)\\right) \\, ds\n$$\nThe integrand is non-zero only if both indicator functions are equal to $1$. This imposes conditions on the integration variable $s$:\n1. From $\\mathbf{1}_{(0,1)}(s) = 1$, we require $0 < s < 1$.\n2. From $\\mathbf{1}_{(0,1)}(t-s) = 1$, we require $0 < t-s < 1$. This implies $t-1 < s < t$.\n\nFor the integral to be non-zero, $s$ must be in the intersection of the intervals $(0,1)$ and $(t-1, t)$. The overall integration is over $[0, t]$, which already contains this intersection. For the specified range $t \\in (1,2)$, we have $0 < t-1 < 1$. The interval of integration for $s$ is thus determined by the intersection:\n$$\n(0,1) \\cap (t-1, t) = (t-1, 1)\n$$\nThe lower bound is $\\max(0, t-1) = t-1$ since $t > 1$. The upper bound is $\\min(1, t) = 1$ since $t > 1$.\nWe can now evaluate the integral:\n$$\nh(t) = \\int_{t-1}^{1} \\frac{1}{s} \\, ds = [\\ln(s)]_{t-1}^{1} = \\ln(1) - \\ln(t-1) = 0 - \\ln(t-1) = -\\ln(t-1)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for $h(t)$ on the interval $t \\in (1,2)$.\n\nThird, we explain why the standard norm control argument for convolution fails. The cornerstone of this argument is Young's inequality for convolutions, which states that if $k \\in L^{1}$ and $f \\in L^{p}$, then $h = k*f \\in L^{p}$ with the norm estimate $\\|h\\|_{L^p} \\leq \\|k\\|_{L^1} \\|f\\|_{L^p}$. The argument fails because a key hypothesis, $k \\in L^{1}$, is not satisfied.\n\nLet's examine the proof of this inequality from first principles to identify the failing step. The $L^{p}$-norm of $h(t)$ is $\\|h\\|_{L^p} = \\left( \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |(k*f)(t)|^p \\, dt \\right)^{1/p}$.\n$$\n\\|h\\|_{L^p}  = \\left( \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left| \\int_{0}^{\\infty} k(s) f(t-s) \\, ds \\right|^p \\, dt \\right)^{1/p}\n$$\nThe first step in the standard proof is to apply Minkowski's integral inequality, which allows one to move the $L^p$ norm inside the integral over $s$:\n$$\n\\|h\\|_{L^p} \\leq \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |k(s) f(t-s)|^p \\, dt \\right)^{1/p} \\, ds = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |k(s)| \\left( \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |f(t-s)|^p \\, dt \\right)^{1/p} \\, ds\n$$\nThe inner part is the $L^p$ norm of a translated version of $f$. Since the $L^p$ norm is translation-invariant, $\\|f(\\cdot-s)\\|_{L^p} = \\|f\\|_{L^p}$. So the inequality becomes:\n$$\n\\|h\\|_{L^p} \\leq \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |k(s)| \\|f\\|_{L^p} \\, ds = \\|f\\|_{L^p} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |k(s)| \\, ds = \\|f\\|_{L^p} \\|k\\|_{L^1}\n$$\nThe application of Minkowski's integral inequality is the step that requires justification. This step, $\\left\\| \\int g(s, \\cdot) ds \\right\\|_{L^p} \\leq \\int \\| g(s, \\cdot) \\|_{L^p} ds$, is valid only if the integral on the right-hand side converges. In our case, the right-hand side is $\\|f\\|_{L^p} \\|k\\|_{L^1}$.\nAs we established in the first part, $\\|k\\|_{L^1} = \\infty$. Since $\\|f\\|_{L^p}=1$ for all $p$, the product $\\|f\\|_{L^p} \\|k\\|_{L^1}$ is infinite. The condition for the application of Minkowski's inequality is not met. Therefore, the inequality cannot be used to establish a finite bound on $\\|h\\|_{L^p}$. The standard argument for norm control is inapplicable because its central hypothesis, the absolute integrability of the kernel $k$, is violated. This failure is not merely a technicality; as shown by the explicit calculation, the convolution $h(t)$ is infinite for $t \\in (0,1)$, meaning $h \\notin L^p((0,\\infty))$ for any $p$. The convolution with $k \\notin L^1$ does not preserve membership in $L^p$ spaces.\n\nFinally, we evaluate $h(t)$ at $t = \\frac{3}{2}$. Since $1 < \\frac{3}{2} < 2$, we can use the expression derived in the second part: $h(t) = -\\ln(t-1)$.\n$$\nh\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{2} - 1\\right) = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(a/b) = \\ln(a) - \\ln(b)$, we have:\n$$\nh\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = -(\\ln(1) - \\ln(2)) = -(0 - \\ln(2)) = \\ln(2)\n$$\nThe exact value is $\\ln(2)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\ln(2)}\n$$", "id": "2985928"}, {"introduction": "A crucial distinction in stochastic calculus is between the pathwise properties of a process and its moment properties.

At $y=1$, $F_{|Y|}(1)=1-1^{-\\alpha}=0$, which means $|Y|$ has support on $[1, \\infty)$. This is a valid probability distribution (a shifted Pareto distribution). The problem is self-contained, logically consistent, and poses a well-defined question within its mathematical context. No scientific or factual unsoundness, ambiguity, or contradiction is present.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem is addressed by completing the three specified tasks and then extracting the final answer.\n\n**1. Progressive Measurability and Almost Sure Finiteness**\n\nA process $(X_s)_{s \\ge 0}$ is progressively measurable with respect to the filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ if for every $t \\in [0,T]$, the mapping $(\\omega,s) \\mapsto X_s(\\omega)$ from $\\Omega \\times [0,t]$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t \\otimes \\mathcal{B}([0,t])$-measurable, where $\\mathcal{B}([0,t])$ is the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra on $[0,t]$.\n\nThe process is defined as $H_s = Y$ for all $s \\in [0,T]$. The random variable $Y$ is given to be $\\mathcal{F}_0$-measurable. This implies that for any $t \\ge 0$, $Y$ is also $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable since $\\mathcal{F}_0 \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}_t$.\nLet $t \\in [0,T]$ be fixed. We examine the map $(\\omega,s) \\mapsto H_s(\\omega) = Y(\\omega)$ on the domain $\\Omega \\times [0,t]$. For any Borel set $B \\in \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})$, we consider the pre-image:\n$$ \\{(\\omega, s) \\in \\Omega \\times [0,t] \\mid H_s(\\omega) \\in B \\} = \\{(\\omega, s) \\in \\Omega \\times [0,t] \\mid Y(\\omega) \\in B \\} $$\nThis set can be written as the Cartesian product:\n$$ \\{ \\omega \\in \\Omega \\mid Y(\\omega) \\in B \\} \\times [0,t] $$\nSince $Y$ is $\\mathcal{F}_0$-measurable and thus $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable, the set $\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega \\mid Y(\\omega) \\in B \\}$ is an element of $\\mathcal{F}_t$. The interval $[0,t]$ is an element of $\\mathcal{B}([0,t])$. The product of a set in $\\mathcal{F}_t$ and a set in $\\mathcal{B}([0,t])$ is, by definition, an element of the product $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_t \\otimes \\mathcal{B}([0,t])$. Thus, $H$ is a progressively measurable process.\n\nNext, we must establish that $\\int_0^T H_s^2\\,ds < \\infty$ almost surely. We substitute the definition of $H_s$:\n$$ \\int_0^T H_s^2 \\,ds = \\int_0^T Y^2 \\,ds $$\nSince $Y$ is a random variable that does not depend on the integration variable $s$, we can factor it out of the integral:\n$$ \\int_0^T Y^2 \\,ds = Y^2 \\int_0^T 1 \\,ds = Y^2 [s]_0^T = T Y^2 $$\nA real-valued random variable $Y$ is a function $Y: \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}$. By this definition, for any $\\omega \\in \\Omega$, $Y(\\omega)$ is a finite real number. Consequently, $Y(\\omega)^2$ is also a finite real number. Since $T$ is a finite constant, the product $T Y(\\omega)^2$ is finite for every $\\omega \\in \\Omega$. Therefore, $\\int_0^T H_s^2\\,ds < \\infty$ surely, which is stronger than almost surely.\n\n**2. Condition for $H \\in L^p(\\Omega;L^2([0,T]))$**\n\nThe condition for $H \\in L^p(\\Omega;L^2([0,T]))$ is the finiteness of the norm $\\mathbb{E}\\big[\\|H\\|_{L^2([0,T])}^p\\big]$. Using the result from part 1:\n$$ \\|H\\|_{L^2([0,T])} = \\left(\\int_0^T H_s^2\\,ds\\right)^{1/2} = (T Y^2)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{T}|Y| $$\nThe condition becomes $\\mathbb{E}\\big[ (\\sqrt{T}|Y|)^p \\big] < \\infty$. Since $T>0$ is a constant, this is equivalent to:\n$$ T^{p/2} \\mathbb{E}[|Y|^p] < \\infty \\iff \\mathbb{E}[|Y|^p] < \\infty $$\nWe must find the values of $p>0$ for which the $p$-th moment of $|Y|$ is finite. We use the tail-integral formula for the moments of a non-negative random variable $X$: for $p>0$, $\\mathbb{E}[X^p] = \\int_0^\\infty p x^{p-1} \\mathbb{P}(X > x) \\,dx$.\nHere, $X=|Y|$. We have $\\mathbb{P}(|Y|>y)=y^{-\\alpha}$ for $y \\ge 1$. As established during validation, this implies $\\mathbb{P}(|Y|\\le 1)=0$, so the support of $|Y|$ is $[1, \\infty)$. Consequently, for $y \\in [0,1)$, $\\mathbb{P}(|Y|>y)=1$. We split the integral at $y=1$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[|Y|^p] = \\int_0^1 p y^{p-1} \\mathbb{P}(|Y|>y)\\,dy + \\int_1^\\infty p y^{p-1} \\mathbb{P}(|Y|>y)\\,dy $$\nSubstituting the probabilities:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[|Y|^p] = \\int_0^1 p y^{p-1} (1) \\,dy + \\int_1^\\infty p y^{p-1} (y^{-\\alpha}) \\,dy $$\nThe first integral is $\\int_0^1 p y^{p-1} \\,dy = [y^p]_0^1 = 1^p - 0^p = 1$, which is finite for any $p>0$.\nThe second integral determines the finiteness of the expectation:\n$$ \\int_1^\\infty p y^{p-1-\\alpha} \\,dy $$\nThis integral converges if and only if the exponent is strictly less than $-1$:\n$$ p - 1 - \\alpha < -1 \\implies p < \\alpha $$\nThus, $\\mathbb{E}[|Y|^p]$ is finite if and only if $p < \\alpha$. This is the necessary and sufficient condition on $p>0$ for $H$ to be in $L^p(\\Omega;L^2([0,T]))$. The set of such $p$ is the interval $(0,\\alpha)$. The supremum of this set is $p^\\star=\\alpha$.\n\n**3. Integrability of the Itô Integral $M_T$**\n\nThe Itô integral $M_T = \\int_0^T H_s\\,dW_s$ is well-defined since $H$ is progressively measurable and $\\int_0^T H_s^2\\,ds < \\infty$ a.s. The process $M_t = \\int_0^t H_s\\,dW_s$ is a continuous local martingale with $M_0=0$. The relationship between the moments of $M_T$ and the properties of the integrand $H$ is precisely described by the Burkholder-Davis-Gundy (BDG) inequalities. For any $p>0$, there exist constants $c_p, C_p > 0$ such that:\n$$ c_p \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\langle M \\rangle_T^{p/2} \\right] \\le \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\sup_{t \\in [0,T]} |M_t|^p \\right] \\le C_p \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\langle M \\rangle_T^{p/2} \\right] $$\nwhere $\\langle M \\rangle_T$ is the quadratic variation of the martingale $M$ at time $T$. For an Itô integral of this form, the quadratic variation is given by $\\langle M \\rangle_T = \\int_0^T H_s^2\\,ds$.\nThe integrability of $M_T$ in $L^p(\\Omega)$ means $\\mathbb{E}[|M_T|^p] < \\infty$. From the left side of the BDG inequalities (noting that $|M_T|^p \\le \\sup_{t \\in [0,T]} |M_t|^p$), the finiteness of $\\mathbb{E}[\\sup_{t\\in[0,T]}|M_t|^p]$ implies the finiteness of $\\mathbb{E}[|M_T|^p]$. From the right side, the finiteness of $\\mathbb{E}[\\langle M \\rangle_T^{p/2}]$ is sufficient for the finiteness of $\\mathbb{E}[\\sup_{t\\in[0,T]}|M_t|^p]$. The inequalities establish an equivalence:\n$$ M_T \\in L^p(\\Omega) \\iff \\langle M \\rangle_T^{1/2} \\in L^p(\\Omega) $$\nThis means $\\mathbb{E}[|M_T|^p] < \\infty$ if and only if $\\mathbb{E}[(\\langle M \\rangle_T^{1/2})^p] < \\infty$.\nWe compute the quantity whose expectation must be finite:\n$$ \\langle M \\rangle_T^{p/2} = \\left( \\int_0^T H_s^2\\,ds \\right)^{p/2} = (T Y^2)^{p/2} = T^{p/2} |Y|^p $$\nFiniteness of the expectation requires $\\mathbb{E}[T^{p/2} |Y|^p] < \\infty$, which is equivalent to $\\mathbb{E}[|Y|^p] < \\infty$.\nThis is the same condition derived in part 2. Therefore, $M_T \\in L^p(\\Omega)$ if and only if $p < \\alpha$. The threshold beyond which higher moments of $M_T$ fail to be finite is precisely $\\alpha$. For any $p \\ge \\alpha$, $\\mathbb{E}[|M_T|^p] = \\infty$. This demonstrates how the tail behavior of the random coefficient $Y$ (parameterized by $\\alpha$) directly controls the existence of moments for the resulting stochastic integral.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation**\nThe question asks for the supremum $p^\\star$ such that $H\\in L^p(\\Omega;L^2([0,T]))$. As shown in part 2, this is equivalent to finding the supremum of $p>0$ such that $\\mathbb{E}[|Y|^p] < \\infty$. This condition was found to be $p < \\alpha$. The set of valid $p$ values is $(0, \\alpha)$. The supremum of this set is $\\alpha$.\nTherefore, $p^\\star = \\alpha$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\alpha}$$", "id": "2985921"}]}
