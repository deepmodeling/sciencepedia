We will address the three parts of the problem sequentially.\n\nPart 1: Prove that $\\tau$ is an $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\ge 0}$-stopping time and that it is bounded by $T$.\n\nFirst, we prove that $\\tau$ is bounded. The random time $\\tau$ is defined as\n$$\n\\tau \\coloneqq \\inf\\{t\\ge 0:\\,|W_t|\\ge a\\}\\wedge T.\n$$\nThe notation $A \\wedge B$ denotes the minimum of $A$ and $B$. Thus, for any sample path $\\omega \\in \\Omega$, the value of $\\tau(\\omega)$ is given by $\\min(\\inf\\{t\\ge 0:\\,|W_t(\\omega)|\\ge a\\}, T)$. By the definition of the minimum, it is always true that $\\tau(\\omega) \\le T$. Since $T$ is a finite constant, the random variable $\\tau$ is bounded above by $T$.\n\nNext, we prove that $\\tau$ is an $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\ge 0}$-stopping time. By definition, a random time $\\tau$ is a stopping time with respect to the filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\ge 0}$ if the event $\\{\\tau \\le t\\}$ is in the $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_t$ for every $t \\ge 0$.\nLet us analyze the event $\\{\\tau \\le t\\}$. We can write $\\tau = \\tau_a \\wedge T$, where $\\tau_a \\coloneqq \\inf\\{t\\ge 0:\\,|W_t|\\ge a\\}$. The event $\\{\\tau \\le t\\}$ can be expressed as\n$$\n\\{\\tau \\le t\\} = \\{\\tau_a \\wedge T \\le t\\} = \\{\\tau_a \\le t\\} \\cup \\{T \\le t\\}.\n$$\nWe consider two cases for $t$.\nCase 1: $t \\ge T$. In this case, the condition $T \\le t$ is always true, so the event $\\{T \\le t\\}$ is the entire sample space $\\Omega$. Since $\\Omega \\in \\mathcal{F}_t$ for any $t$, the union $\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\} \\cup \\Omega = \\Omega$ is also in $\\mathcal{F}_t$.\nCase 2: $0 \\le t < T$. In this case, the condition $T \\le t$ is never true, so the event $\\{T \\le t\\}$ is the empty set $\\emptyset$. The union becomes $\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\} \\cup \\emptyset = \\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}$. We must show that $\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\} \\in \\mathcal{F}_t$.\n\nThe event $\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}$ is the set of all sample paths $\\omega$ for which there exists a time $s \\in [0, t]$ such that $|W_s(\\omega)| \\ge a$. This is equivalent to the event $\\{\\sup_{s \\in [0,t]} |W_s| \\ge a\\}$.\nA standard property of Brownian motion is that its sample paths $s \\mapsto W_s(\\omega)$ are continuous for almost all $\\omega$. For a continuous function on a closed interval $[0,t]$, its supremum is attained. The continuity of paths allows us to write the supremum over the uncountable set $[0,t]$ as a supremum over a countable dense subset, such as the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0,t]$.\n$$\n\\{\\sup_{s \\in [0,t]} |W_s| \\ge a\\} = \\{\\sup_{s \\in [0,t]\\cap\\mathbb{Q}} |W_s| \\ge a\\}.\n$$\nThe event on the right can be expressed using countable set operations. An equivalent formulation is\n$$\n\\{\\sup_{s \\in [0,t]} |W_s| \\ge a\\} = \\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty \\bigcup_{s \\in [0,t]\\cap\\mathbb{Q}} \\left\\{ |W_s| > a - \\frac{1}{n} \\right\\}.\n$$\nFor any fixed time $s \\in [0,t]\\cap\\mathbb{Q}$, the random variable $W_s$ is adapted to the filtration, meaning $W_s$ is $\\mathcal{F}_s$-measurable. Since $s \\le t$, the filtration is non-decreasing ($\\mathcal{F}_s \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}_t$), so $W_s$ is also $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable. The function $x \\mapsto |x|$ is a continuous (and thus Borel) function, so $|W_s|$ is also $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable. Consequently, for any real number $c$, the set $\\{|W_s| > c\\}$ is an event in $\\mathcal{F}_t$.\nThe set $[0,t]\\cap\\mathbb{Q}$ is a countable set. A $\\sigma$-algebra is closed under countable unions. Therefore, for each integer $n \\ge 1$, the event $\\bigcup_{s \\in [0,t]\\cap\\mathbb{Q}} \\{|W_s| > a - 1/n\\}$ belongs to $\\mathcal{F}_t$.\nA $\\sigma$-algebra is also closed under countable intersections. Thus, the event $\\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty \\bigcup_{s \\in [0,t]\\cap\\mathbb{Q}} \\{|W_s| > a - 1/n\\}$ is in $\\mathcal{F}_t$.\nThis shows that for $0 \\le t < T$, the event $\\{\\tau \\le t\\} = \\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}$ is in $\\mathcal{F}_t$.\n\nCombining both cases, we have established that for any $t \\ge 0$, the event $\\{\\tau \\le t\\} \\in \\mathcal{F}_t$. Therefore, $\\tau$ is an $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\ge 0}$-stopping time.\n\nPart 2: Prove that $(M_t)_{t\\ge 0}$ is an $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\ge 0}$-martingale and justify the properties of $M_\\tau$.\n\nA process $(M_t)_{t\\ge 0}$ is a martingale with respect to the filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\ge 0}$ if it satisfies three conditions:\n1.  $M_t$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable for all $t\\ge 0$.\nThe process is defined as $M_t = \\exp(\\theta W_t - \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 t)$. The Brownian motion $W_t$ is adapted to $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$, meaning $W_t$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable. Any constant is also $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable. The functions of multiplication and addition are measurable, so the expression $\\theta W_t - \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 t$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable. The exponential function $x \\mapsto \\exp(x)$ is continuous, hence Borel-measurable. The composition of a measurable function and a Borel-measurable function is measurable. Therefore, $M_t$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\n2.  $M_t$ is integrable for all $t\\ge 0$, i.e., $\\mathbb{E}[|M_t|] < \\infty$.\nSince the exponential function outputs only positive values, $|M_t| = M_t$. We compute its expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[M_t] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\theta W_t - \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 t\\right)\\right] = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 t\\right) \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\exp(\\theta W_t)\\right].\n$$\nFor a standard Brownian motion, $W_t$ is a normally distributed random variable with mean $0$ and variance $t$, i.e., $W_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t)$. The moment-generating function of a normal random variable $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ is $\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(uX)] = \\exp(\\mu u + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 u^2)$. For $W_t$, we have $\\mu=0$ and $\\sigma^2=t$. With $u=\\theta$, we get:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\theta W_t)] = \\exp\\left(0 \\cdot \\theta + \\frac{1}{2}t\\theta^2\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 t\\right).\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expectation of $M_t$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[M_t] = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 t\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 t\\right) = 1.\n$$\nSince $\\mathbb{E}[|M_t|] = \\mathbb{E}[M_t] = 1$, which is finite, $M_t$ is integrable for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\n3.  $\\mathbb{E}[M_t | \\mathcal{F}_s] = M_s$ for all $0 \\le s < t$.\nWe compute the conditional expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[M_t | \\mathcal{F}_s] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\theta W_t - \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 t\\right) \\bigg| \\mathcal{F}_s\\right].\n$$\nWe rewrite the argument of the exponential by adding and subtracting terms involving $W_s$ and $s$:\n$$\n\\theta W_t - \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 t = \\theta(W_t - W_s + W_s) - \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2(t - s + s) = \\left(\\theta(W_t - W_s) - \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2(t-s)\\right) + \\left(\\theta W_s - \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 s\\right).\n$$\nSo, $M_t = \\exp(\\theta(W_t - W_s) - \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2(t-s)) \\cdot M_s$.\nThe term $M_s = \\exp(\\theta W_s - \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 s)$ is $\\mathcal{F}_s$-measurable, so it can be taken out of the conditional expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[M_t | \\mathcal{F}_s] = M_s \\cdot \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\theta(W_t - W_s) - \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2(t-s)\\right) \\bigg| \\mathcal{F}_s\\right].\n$$\nThe increment $W_t - W_s$ is independent of the $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_s$ by the definition of Brownian motion. Therefore, the random variable $\\exp(\\theta(W_t-W_s) - \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2(t-s))$ is also independent of $\\mathcal{F}_s$, and its conditional expectation is just its unconditional expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[M_t | \\mathcal{F}_s] = M_s \\cdot \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\theta(W_t - W_s) - \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2(t-s)\\right)\\right].\n$$\nThe increment $W_t - W_s$ is normally distributed as $\\mathcal{N}(0, t-s)$. Using the same logic as in point 2, with variance $t-s$, we find:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\theta(W_t - W_s))] = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(t-s)\\theta^2\\right).\n$$\nThe expectation term becomes:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2(t-s)\\right) \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\theta(W_t - W_s))] = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2(t-s)\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2(t-s)\\right) = 1.\n$$\nThus, we have shown $\\mathbb{E}[M_t | \\mathcal{F}_s] = M_s \\cdot 1 = M_s$. All three conditions are satisfied, so $(M_t)_{t\\ge 0}$ is an $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\ge 0}$-martingale.\n\nNow we justify the properties of $M_\\tau$.\n-   $M_\\tau$ is well-defined: The sample paths of Brownian motion $t \\mapsto W_t(\\omega)$ are continuous. Since $\\theta, \\theta^2$ are constants, the function $t \\mapsto \\theta W_t(\\omega) - \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 t$ is also continuous. The exponential function is continuous, so the process paths $t \\mapsto M_t(\\omega)$ are continuous. Since $\\tau$ is a random variable taking values in $[0, T]$, the composition $M_\\tau(\\omega) \\coloneqq M_{\\tau(\\omega)}(\\omega)$ is well-defined.\n-   $M_\\tau$ is measurable with respect to $\\mathcal{F}$: A general theorem states that if $X_t$ is an adapted process with right-continuous paths and $\\tau$ is a stopping time, then $X_\\tau$ is $\\mathcal{F}_\\tau$-measurable. Our process $M_t$ has continuous paths, so it is right-continuous. The filtration is assumed to satisfy the usual conditions, which includes right-continuity. Thus, $M_\\tau$ is $\\mathcal{F}_\\tau$-measurable. The full $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{F}$ contains all $\\mathcal{F}_t$, and since $\\tau$ is a bounded stopping time, it can be shown that $\\mathcal{F}_\\tau \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}_T \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}$. Thus $M_\\tau$ is $\\mathcal{F}$-measurable.\n-   $M_\\tau$ is integrable: We need to show $\\mathbb{E}[|M_\\tau|] < \\infty$. As $M_\\tau > 0$, this is $\\mathbb{E}[M_\\tau] < \\infty$. By definition of $\\tau$, for any $t < \\tau$, we have $|W_t| < a$. By continuity of paths, at time $\\tau$, we must have $|W_\\tau| \\le a$. Also, $\\tau \\ge 0$, which implies $-\\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 \\tau \\le 0$. We can bound $M_\\tau$:\n$$\nM_\\tau = \\exp\\left(\\theta W_\\tau - \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 \\tau\\right) \\le \\exp(\\theta W_\\tau).\n$$\nFurthermore, $\\theta W_\\tau \\le |\\theta| |W_\\tau| \\le |\\theta| a$. So,\n$$\nM_\\tau \\le \\exp(|\\theta| a).\n$$\nSince $M_\\tau$ is a positive random variable that is bounded above by the finite constant $\\exp(|\\theta| a)$, its expectation is finite: $\\mathbb{E}[M_\\tau] \\le \\exp(|\\theta| a) < \\infty$. Thus, $M_\\tau$ is an integrable random variable.\n\nPart 3: Compute the value of $\\mathbb{E}[M_\\tau]$.\n\nWe will use the Optional Stopping Theorem. There are several versions of this theorem. The simplest version states that if $(M_t)_{t\\ge 0}$ is a martingale and $\\tau$ is a bounded stopping time, then $\\mathbb{E}[M_\\tau] = \\mathbb{E}[M_0]$.\nFrom Part 1, we established that $\\tau \\le T$, and since $T$ is a finite constant, $\\tau$ is a bounded stopping time.\nFrom Part 2, we proved that $(M_t)_{t\\ge 0}$ is a martingale.\nThe conditions for the simplest version of the Optional Stopping Theorem are met. Therefore, we can conclude that\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[M_\\tau] = \\mathbb{E}[M_0].\n$$\nWe compute $\\mathbb{E}[M_0]$. A standard Brownian motion starts at $0$, so $W_0=0$ almost surely.\n$$\nM_0 = \\exp\\left(\\theta W_0 - \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 \\cdot 0\\right) = \\exp(\\theta \\cdot 0 - 0) = \\exp(0) = 1.\n$$\nThe random variable $M_0$ is the constant $1$. Its expectation is\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[M_0] = \\mathbb{E}[1] = 1.\n$$\nTherefore, by the Optional Stopping Theorem,\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[M_\\tau] = 1.\n$$\nThis result is independent of the values of $a$, $T$, and $\\theta$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "2992982"}, {"introduction": "Building on the properties of individual martingales, this practice delves into their interaction by constructing the covariation process from first principles.

The foundational fact states that for any such process $M$, there is a unique continuous, adapted, increasing process $[M]$ with $[M]_0=0$ such that $M^2 - [M]$ is a continuous local martingale.\n\n**1) Construction of the Covariation Process $[X, Y]$**\n\nThe construction of the covariation process $[X, Y]$ can be achieved using the polarization identity, which expresses a product in terms of squares. For any two real numbers $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $xy = \\frac{1}{4}\\left((x+y)^2 - (x-y)^2\\right)$. We apply this identity to the processes $X$ and $Y$.\n\nSince $X$ and $Y$ are continuous local martingales, their sum $X+Y$ and difference $X-Y$ are also continuous local martingales. Applying the foundational fact to $X+Y$ and $X-Y$, there exist unique continuous, adapted, increasing processes $[X+Y]$ and $[X-Y]$ starting at $0$ such that $(X+Y)^2 - [X+Y]$ and $(X-Y)^2 - [X-Y]$ are local martingales.\n\nLet us consider the product process $XY$. Using the polarization identity, we can write:\n$$\nX_t Y_t = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( (X_t+Y_t)^2 - (X_t-Y_t)^2 \\right)\n$$\nWe can rewrite this expression by adding and subtracting the corresponding quadratic variation terms:\n$$\nX_t Y_t = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\left((X_t+Y_t)^2 - [X+Y]_t\\right) - \\left((X_t-Y_t)^2 - [X-Y]_t\\right) + \\left([X+Y]_t - [X-Y]_t\\right) \\right)\n$$\nLet $L_{1,t} = (X_t+Y_t)^2 - [X+Y]_t$ and $L_{2,t} = (X_t-Y_t)^2 - [X-Y]_t$. By construction, $L_1$ and $L_2$ are local martingales. The expression for $X_t Y_t$ becomes:\n$$\nX_t Y_t = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( L_{1,t} - L_{2,t} \\right) + \\frac{1}{4} \\left( [X+Y]_t - [X-Y]_t \\right)\n$$\nThis is the Doob-Meyer decomposition of the semimartingale $XY$. The term $\\frac{1}{4}(L_1 - L_2)$ is a local martingale, being a linear combination of local martingales. The term $\\frac{1}{4}([X+Y] - [X-Y])$ is a continuous, adapted process starting at $0$. Since $[X+Y]$ and $[X-Y]$ are increasing, their difference is a process of finite variation.\n\nThis motivates the definition of the covariation process $[X,Y]$ as the finite-variation part of this decomposition:\n$$\n[X,Y]_t := \\frac{1}{4} \\left( [X+Y]_t - [X-Y]_t \\right)\n$$\nBy this construction, the process $X_t Y_t - [X,Y]_t$ is a local martingale.\n\nThis construction does not depend on arbitrary choices. The processes $[X+Y]$ and $[X-Y]$ are uniquely determined by the foundational fact. Since $[X,Y]$ is defined explicitly in terms of these unique processes, $[X,Y]$ is itself unique. It is the unique continuous, adapted process of finite variation starting at $0$ such that $XY - [X,Y]$ is a local martingale.\n\n**2) Symmetry and Bilinearity of the Covariation**\n\nWe now prove the requested properties based on our construction.\n\n**Symmetry:** We must show that $[X,Y] = [Y,X]$.\nBy definition,\n$$\n[Y,X]_t = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( [Y+X]_t - [Y-X]_t \\right)\n$$\nSince addition is commutative, $X+Y = Y+X$, and thus by uniqueness, $[X+Y] = [Y+X]$.\nFor the second term, consider the process $M = X-Y$. Then $Y-X = -M$. We need to show that $[M] = [-M]$. The process $(-M)^2 - [-M]$ is a local martingale by definition. But $(-M)^2=M^2$, so $M^2 - [-M]$ is a local martingale. We also know that $M^2 - [M]$ is a local martingale. The difference, $(M^2 - [M]) - (M^2 - [-M]) = [-M] - [M]$, must also be a local martingale. This difference is a continuous process of finite variation starting at $0$. The only such process is the zero process. Hence, $[-M] = [M]$. Applying this with $M=X-Y$, we get $[Y-X]=[-(X-Y)]=[X-Y]$.\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $[Y,X]_t$:\n$$\n[Y,X]_t = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( [X+Y]_t - [X-Y]_t \\right) = [X,Y]_t\n$$\nThus, the covariation is symmetric.\n\n**Bilinearity:** We need to show that for any real constants $a,b$ and continuous local martingales $X_1, X_2, Y$, we have $[aX_1+bX_2, Y] = a[X_1, Y] + b[X_2, Y]$.\nWe will use the characterization that for any continuous local martingales $U$ and $V$, $[U,V]$ is the unique continuous adapted process of finite variation such that $UV - [U,V]$ is a local martingale.\nLet $Z = aX_1 + bX_2$. We want to find $[Z,Y]$. We know that:\n$X_1 Y - [X_1,Y]$ is a local martingale.\n$X_2 Y - [X_2,Y]$ is a local martingale.\nSince the set of local martingales is a vector space, any linear combination of local martingales is a local martingale. Therefore, for constants $a$ and $b$:\n$$\na(X_1 Y - [X_1,Y]) + b(X_2 Y - [X_2,Y]) \\quad \\text{is a local martingale.}\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we find that\n$$\n(aX_1 Y + bX_2 Y) - (a[X_1,Y] + b[X_2,Y]) \\quad \\text{is a local martingale.}\n$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$\n(aX_1+bX_2)Y - (a[X_1,Y] + b[X_2,Y]) \\quad \\text{is a local martingale.}\n$$\nLet's define a process $C_t = a[X_1,Y]_t + b[X_2,Y]_t$. The process $C$ is a linear combination of continuous adapted processes of finite variation, so it is also a continuous adapted process of finite variation. The above shows that $(aX_1+bX_2)Y - C$ is a local martingale.\nBy the uniqueness of the covariation process, $C$ must be the covariation of $aX_1+bX_2$ and $Y$. That is:\n$$\n[aX_1+bX_2, Y] = C = a[X_1, Y] + b[X_2, Y]\n$$\nThis establishes linearity in the first argument. The linearity in the second argument follows from symmetry: $[X, aY_1+bY_2] = [aY_1+bY_2, X] = a[Y_1,X]+b[Y_2,X] = a[X,Y_1]+b[X,Y_2]$. Thus, the covariation is bilinear.\n\n**3) Predictability of the Covariation**\n\nA process is predictable if it is measurable with respect to the predictable $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{P}$, which is defined as the smallest $\\sigma$-algebra making all left-continuous adapted processes measurable.\n\nFrom our construction, $[X,Y]_t = \\frac{1}{4}([X+Y]_t - [X-Y]_t)$. To show $[X,Y]$ is predictable, it suffices to show that for any continuous local martingale $M$, its quadratic variation $[M]$ is a predictable process.\n\nAccording to the foundational fact, for a continuous local martingale $M$, the process $[M]$ is continuous and adapted. A process whose sample paths are continuous is necessarily left-continuous. Thus, $[M]$ is a left-continuous adapted process.\n\nBy the given definition of the predictable $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{P}$, all left-continuous adapted processes are, by definition, measurable with respect to $\\mathcal{P}$. Therefore, the process $[M]$ is predictable.\n\nSince $X+Y$ and $X-Y$ are continuous local martingales, their quadratic variations $[X+Y]$ and $[X-Y]$ are predictable processes. The set of predictable processes is a vector space, closed under linear combinations. Consequently, the process\n$$\n[X,Y] = \\frac{1}{4}[X+Y] - \\frac{1}{4}[X-Y]\n$$\nbeing a linear combination of predictable processes, is also predictable.\n\n**4) Covariation of Independent Brownian Motions**\n\nWe are given $X_t = B^1_t$ and $Y_t = B^2_t$, where $(B^1_t)_{t\\ge 0}$ and $(B^2_t)_{t\\ge 0}$ are two independent standard Brownian motions. We need to compute $[X,Y]_t = [B^1, B^2]_t$.\n\nWe will determine if the process $M_t = B^1_t B^2_t$ is a martingale. If it is, then its finite-variation part in the Doob-Meyer decomposition must be zero.\nLet $s<t$. We compute the conditional expectation $\\mathbb{E}[B^1_t B^2_t | \\mathcal{F}_s]$, where $\\mathcal{F}_s = \\sigma(B^1_u, B^2_u, u \\le s)$.\nWe write $B^1_t = B^1_s + (B^1_t-B^1_s)$ and $B^2_t = B^2_s + (B^2_t-B^2_s)$.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{E}[B^1_t B^2_t | \\mathcal{F}_s] &= \\mathbb{E}[(B^1_s + (B^1_t-B^1_s))(B^2_s + (B^2_t-B^2_s)) | \\mathcal{F}_s] \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{E}[B^1_s B^2_s | \\mathcal{F}_s] + \\mathbb{E}[B^1_s(B^2_t-B^2_s) | \\mathcal{F}_s] + \\mathbb{E}[(B^1_t-B^1_s)B^2_s | \\mathcal{F}_s] + \\mathbb{E}[(B^1_t-B^1_s)(B^2_t-B^2_s) | \\mathcal{F}_s]\n\\end{align*}\nSince $B^1_s$ and $B^2_s$ are $\\mathcal{F}_s$-measurable, they can be treated as constants in the conditional expectation. The increments $(B^1_t-B^1_s)$ and $(B^2_t-B^2_s)$ are independent of $\\mathcal{F}_s$.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{E}[B^1_t B^2_t | \\mathcal{F}_s] &= B^1_s B^2_s + B^1_s \\mathbb{E}[B^2_t-B^2_s | \\mathcal{F}_s] + B^2_s \\mathbb{E}[B^1_t-B^1_s | \\mathcal{F}_s] + \\mathbb{E}[(B^1_t-B^1_s)(B^2_t-B^2_s) | \\mathcal{F}_s] \\\\\n&= B^1_s B^2_s + B^1_s \\mathbb{E}[B^2_t-B^2_s] + B^2_s \\mathbb{E}[B^1_t-B^1_s] + \\mathbb{E}[(B^1_t-B^1_s)(B^2_t-B^2_s)]\n\\end{align*}\nThe increments have zero mean: $\\mathbb{E}[B^1_t-B^1_s]=0$ and $\\mathbb{E}[B^2_t-B^2_s]=0$. Since the processes $B^1$ and $B^2$ are independent, the increments over the same interval $(s,t]$ are also independent. Therefore,\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[(B^1_t-B^1_s)(B^2_t-B^2_s)] = \\mathbb{E}[B^1_t-B^1_s] \\mathbb{E}[B^2_t-B^2_s] = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0.\n$$\nSubstituting these results back, we obtain:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[B^1_t B^2_t | \\mathcal{F}_s] = B^1_s B^2_s + B^1_s \\cdot 0 + B^2_s \\cdot 0 + 0 = B^1_s B^2_s.\n$$\nThis shows that the process $M_t = B^1_t B^2_t$ is a martingale, and thus a local martingale.\nWe have the decomposition $M_t = M_t + 0$.\nWe also have the defining decomposition $M_t = (M_t - [B^1, B^2]_t) + [B^1, B^2]_t$, where $M_t - [B^1, B^2]_t$ is a local martingale and $[B^1, B^2]_t$ is a continuous adapted process of finite variation starting at $0$.\nBy the uniqueness of this decomposition, we must have $[B^1, B^2]_t = 0$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\nTherefore, for any fixed $t > 0$, the value is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2992980"}]}
