Let the standard one-dimensional Brownian motion be $\\{B_{s}: s \\geq 0\\}$. The defining properties are:\n1.  The sample paths $s \\mapsto B_{s}$ are continuous with probability $1$.\n2.  $B_{0} = 0$.\n3.  For any $0 \\leq s_{1} < s_{2} < \\dots < s_{n}$, the increments $B_{s_2}-B_{s_1}, B_{s_3}-B_{s_2}, \\dots, B_{s_n}-B_{s_{n-1}}$ are independent random variables.\n4.

We want to find an expression for $F_{ct}(x,y)$ in terms of $F_t$ for a constant $c > 0$.\n\nThe core of the derivation relies on the scaling property of Brownian motion. Let us define a new stochastic process $\\{W_s: s \\ge 0\\}$ by scaling both time and space of the original Brownian motion $\\{B_s\\}$:\n$$\nW_{s} := \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}} B_{cs}\n$$\nfor a fixed constant $c > 0$. We must first verify from first principles that $\\{W_s\\}$ is also a standard Brownian motion.\n\n1.  **Continuity of paths**: Since $s \\mapsto cs$ is a continuous function and the paths of $B$ are continuous, the composition $s \\mapsto B_{cs}$ is continuous. Scaling by a constant $1/\\sqrt{c}$ preserves continuity. Thus, the paths of $W$ are continuous.\n2.  **Starting point**: $W_{0} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}} B_{c \\cdot 0} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}} B_{0} = 0$.\n3.  **Distribution of increments**: For any $s, u \\geq 0$, the increment is $W_{u+s} - W_{u} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}} (B_{c(u+s)} - B_{cu})$. The variable $B_{c(u+s)} - B_{cu}$ is an increment of a standard Brownian motion over a time interval of length $c(u+s) - cu = cs$. According to property 4, this increment is a Gaussian random variable with mean $0$ and variance $cs$.\n    Therefore, the mean of the increment of $W$ is $\\mathbb{E}[W_{u+s} - W_{u}] = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}} \\mathbb{E}[B_{c(u+s)} - B_{cu}] = 0$.\n    The variance is $\\mathbb{V}(W_{u+s} - W_{u}) = \\mathbb{V}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}} (B_{c(u+s)} - B_{cu})\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}}\\right)^2 \\mathbb{V}(B_{c(u+s)} - B_{cu}) = \\frac{1}{c} (cs) = s$.\n    So, $W_{u+s} - W_{u} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,s)$, which demonstrates that the increments of $W$ are stationary and have the correct distribution.\n4.  **Independence of increments**: Consider any non-overlapping time intervals $[s_1, s_2]$ and $[s_3, s_4]$ for the process $W$, where $0 \\le s_1 < s_2 \\le s_3 < s_4$. The corresponding increments are $W_{s_2} - W_{s_1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}}(B_{cs_2} - B_{cs_1})$ and $W_{s_4} - W_{s_3} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}}(B_{cs_4} - B_{cs_3})$. These depend on the increments of $B$ over the time intervals $[cs_1, cs_2]$ and $[cs_3, cs_4]$. Since $s_2 \\le s_3$, we have $cs_2 \\le cs_3$, so these intervals for $B$ are also non-overlapping. By property 3 of Brownian motion, the increments of $B$ over these intervals are independent. Therefore, the corresponding increments of $W$ are independent.\n\nThis confirms that $\\{W_s: s \\ge 0\\}$ is a standard Brownian motion, identical in law to $\\{B_s\\}$.\n\nNow we can proceed to relate $F_{ct}(x,y)$ to $F_t$. By definition:\n$$\nF_{ct}(x,y) = \\mathbb{P}(M_{ct} \\leq x, m_{ct} \\geq y) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\sup_{0 \\leq s \\leq ct} B_{s} \\leq x, \\inf_{0 \\leq s \\leq ct} B_{s} \\geq y\\right).\n$$\nLet us perform a change of variable in the time index of the supremum and infimum. Let $s = cu$, where $u$ is the new time variable. As $s$ varies from $0$ to $ct$, $u$ varies from $0$ to $t$. Substituting $s=cu$ into the expression:\n$$\nF_{ct}(x,y) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\sup_{0 \\leq u \\leq t} B_{cu} \\leq x, \\inf_{0 \\leq u \\leq t} B_{cu} \\geq y\\right).\n$$\nNow, we use the scaling relationship $B_{cu} = \\sqrt{c} W_u$:\n$$\nF_{ct}(x,y) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\sup_{0 \\leq u \\leq t} (\\sqrt{c} W_u) \\leq x, \\inf_{0 \\leq u \\leq t} (\\sqrt{c} W_u) \\geq y\\right).\n$$\nSince $c > 0$, $\\sqrt{c}$ is a positive constant and can be factored out of the supremum and infimum operators:\n$$\nF_{ct}(x,y) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\sqrt{c} \\sup_{0 \\leq u \\leq t} W_u \\leq x, \\sqrt{c} \\inf_{0 \\leq u \\leq t} W_u \\geq y\\right).\n$$\nWe can rearrange the inequalities by dividing by $\\sqrt{c}$:\n$$\nF_{ct}(x,y) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\sup_{0 \\leq u \\leq t} W_u \\leq \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{c}}, \\inf_{0 \\leq u \\leq t} W_u \\geq \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{c}}\\right).\n$$\nLet $M'_t = \\sup_{0 \\leq u \\leq t} W_u$ and $m'_t = \\inf_{0 \\leq u \\leq t} W_u$ be the running maximum and minimum of the process $W$. The expression becomes:\n$$\nF_{ct}(x,y) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(M'_{t} \\leq \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{c}}, m'_{t} \\geq \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{c}}\\right).\n$$\nSince we have shown that $\\{W_u\\}$ is a standard Brownian motion, the joint law of $(M'_t, m'_t)$ is identical to the joint law of $(M_t, m_t)$. Therefore, the probability above is given by the function $F_t$ evaluated at the points $x/\\sqrt{c}$ and $y/\\sqrt{c}$:\n$$\nF_{ct}(x,y) = F_t\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{c}}, \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{c}}\\right).\n$$\nThis is the desired scaling relationship.

The final answer required is the closed-form expression for this probability.\n\n1) Derivation of $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_{a} \\leq t)$\n\nLet $\\{B_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ be a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion with $B_0=0$. We are given $a>0$ and $t>0$. The first hitting time of the level $a$ is $\\tau_a = \\inf\\{s \\ge 0 : B_s = a\\}$. We want to compute $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t)$.\n\nThe event $\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}$ is equivalent to the event that the maximum of the process up to time $t$ is at least $a$. Let $M_t = \\sup_{0 \\le s \\le t} B_s$. Then we are seeking to calculate $\\mathbb{P}(M_t \\ge a)$.\n\nWe can partition the event $\\{M_t \\ge a\\}$ based on the value of $B_t$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(M_t \\ge a) = \\mathbb{P}(M_t \\ge a, B_t \\ge a) + \\mathbb{P}(M_t \\ge a, B_t < a).\n$$\nIf the process ends at $B_t \\ge a$, starting from $B_0=0$, by the continuity of Brownian paths, it must have reached the value $a$ at some earlier time. Thus, the event $\\{B_t \\ge a\\}$ implies the event $\\{M_t \\ge a\\}$. This means $\\{M_t \\ge a, B_t \\ge a\\} = \\{B_t \\ge a\\}$.\nSo, the first term is simply $\\mathbb{P}(B_t \\ge a)$.\n\nFor the second term, we use the reflection principle, which is a consequence of the strong Markov property of Brownian motion at the stopping time $\\tau_a$. The event $\\{M_t \\ge a\\}$ is the same as $\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}$. So we analyze $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t, B_t < a)$.\nOn the event $\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}$, the process $X_s = B_{\\tau_a+s} - B_{\\tau_a}$ for $s \\ge 0$ is a standard Brownian motion starting at $0$ and is independent of the pre-$\\tau_a$ sigma-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a}$.\nThe condition $B_t < a$ can be written as $B_t - a < 0$. On $\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}$, we have $B_{\\tau_a}=a$, so this is $B_t - B_{\\tau_a} < 0$.\nThis corresponds to the event $X_{t-\\tau_a} < 0$.\nBy the symmetry of Brownian motion, for any fixed time $u>0$, a standard Brownian motion $X$ satisfies $\\mathbb{P}(X_u < 0) = \\mathbb{P}(X_u > 0) = 1/2$.\nTherefore, conditional on $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a}$ and on the event $\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}$ (which implies $t-\\tau_a \\ge 0$), we have:\n$\\mathbb{P}(B_t < a | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a}) = \\mathbb{P}(B_t - B_{\\tau_a} < 0 | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a}) = \\mathbb{P}(X_{t-\\tau_a} < 0 | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a}) = 1/2$.\nSimilarly, $\\mathbb{P}(B_t > a | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a}) = 1/2$. (Note that $\\mathbb{P}(B_t=a)=0$ as $B_t$ has a continuous distribution).\n\nHence, we can write:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t, B_t < a) = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{1}_{\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}} \\mathbb{P}(B_t < a | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a})] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{1}_{\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}] = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t).\n$$\nSubstituting this back into our original partition:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t) = \\mathbb{P}(B_t \\ge a) + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t).\n$$\nSolving for $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t)$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t) = \\mathbb{P}(B_t \\ge a) \\implies \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t) = 2 \\mathbb{P}(B_t \\ge a).\n$$\nSince $\\{B_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ is a standard Brownian motion, $B_t$ is a normally distributed random variable with mean $0$ and variance $t$, i.e., $B_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t)$. The standardized variable $Z = B_t/\\sqrt{t}$ follows the standard normal distribution, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$.\nThe probability $\\mathbb{P}(B_t \\ge a)$ can be expressed in terms of the standard normal cumulative distribution function, $\\Phi(z) = \\mathbb{P}(Z \\le z)$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(B_t \\ge a) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\frac{B_t}{\\sqrt{t}} \\ge \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{t}}\\right) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(Z \\ge \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{t}}\\right) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{t}}\\right).\n$$\nTherefore, the boundary crossing probability is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t) = 2 \\left(1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{t}}\\right)\\right).\n$$\nThis completes the first part and provides the expression for the final answer.\n\n2) Time Inversion and Last Exit Times\n\nFirst, we show that $\\{\\widehat{B}_u\\}_{u>0}$ defined by $\\widehat{B}_u = u B_{1/u}$ is a standard Brownian motion on $(0, \\infty)$.\nA process is a standard Brownian motion if it is a centered Gaussian process with covariance function $\\mathbb{E}[X_s X_t] = \\min(s,t)$ and has continuous sample paths.\n- **Gaussian Process**: Since $B_t$ is a Gaussian process, and $\\widehat{B}_u$ is formed by linear scaling of $B_t$, $\\{\\widehat{B}_u\\}_{u>0}$ is also a Gaussian process.\n- **Mean**: $\\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{B}_u] = \\mathbb{E}[u B_{1/u}] = u \\mathbb{E}[B_{1/u}] = u \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n- **Covariance**: For $0 < u \\le v$, we have $1/u \\ge 1/v$. The covariance of standard Brownian motion is $\\mathbb{E}[B_s B_t] = \\min(s,t)$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{B}_u \\widehat{B}_v] = \\mathbb{E}[(u B_{1/u}) (v B_{1/v})] = uv \\mathbb{E}[B_{1/u} B_{1/v}] = uv \\min(1/u, 1/v) = uv \\cdot (1/v) = u.\n$$\nSince $u = \\min(u,v)$, the covariance function is $\\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{B}_u \\widehat{B}_v] = \\min(u,v)$.\n- **Path Continuity**: For any $u>0$, the paths of $\\widehat{B}_u$ are continuous because they are compositions and products of continuous functions ($u \\mapsto u$, $u \\mapsto 1/u$, and $s \\mapsto B_s$).\n- **Behavior at $0$**: We need to show that $\\lim_{u\\to 0^+} \\widehat{B}_u = 0$ almost surely. Let $s=1/u$. As $u \\to 0^+$, $s \\to \\infty$. The limit becomes $\\lim_{s\\to\\infty} (1/s) B_s$. By the Strong Law of Large Numbers for Brownian motion, $\\lim_{s\\to\\infty} B_s/s = 0$ almost surely.\nThus, $\\{\\widehat{B}_u\\}_{u \\ge 0}$ with $\\widehat{B}_0=0$ is a standard Brownian motion.\n\nNext, we relate the event $\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}$ to the last exit time $L_a = \\sup\\{ u>0 : \\widehat{B}_{u} = a u\\}$.\nThe event $\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}$ means that there exists some time $s \\in (0, t]$ such that $B_s = a$. (We exclude $s=0$ as $B_0=0 \\neq a$).\nLet's transform this condition using the time inversion $u = 1/s$. As $s$ ranges over $(0, t]$, $u$ ranges over $[1/t, \\infty)$.\nThe condition $B_s = a$ is equivalent to $B_{1/u} = a$. Multiplying by $u>0$, we get $u B_{1/u} = au$, which is precisely $\\widehat{B}_u = au$.\nSo, the event $\\{\\exists s \\in (0, t] : B_s = a\\}$ is identical to the event $\\{\\exists u \\in [1/t, \\infty) : \\widehat{B}_u = au\\}$.\nThe latter event means that the set of times $u \\ge 1/t$ for which $\\widehat{B}_u$ hits the line $y=au$ is non-empty. This is precisely the event that the last exit time from this line, $L_a = \\sup\\{ u>0 : \\widehat{B}_{u} = a u\\}$, is greater than or equal to $1/t$.\nTherefore, the events are identical: $\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\} = \\{L_a \\ge 1/t\\}$.\nThis implies their probabilities are equal: $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t) = \\mathbb{P}(L_a \\ge 1/t)$.\n\nFinally, we explain the role of $G_a = \\sup\\{ s \\in (0, 1] : \\widehat{B}_s = as \\}$ when $t \\ge 1$.\nFor $t \\ge 1$, we can decompose the probability $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t)$ into two disjoint scenarios: either the first hit occurs before time $1$, or it occurs between time $1$ and $t$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t) = \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a < 1) + \\mathbb{P}(1 \\le \\tau_a \\le t).\n$$\nWe can find a correspondence for each term using the time inversion.\n- The event $\\{\\tau_a < 1\\} = \\{\\exists s \\in (0,1) : B_s=a\\}$ corresponds to $\\{\\exists u > 1 : \\widehat{B}_u = au\\}$. This is exactly the event that the last exit time $L_a$ is greater than $1$, i.e., $\\{L_a > 1\\}$. So, $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a < 1) = \\mathbb{P}(L_a > 1)$.\n- The event $\\{1 \\le \\tau_a \\le t\\} = \\{\\sup_{s<1} B_s < a \\text{ and } \\exists s' \\in [1,t] : B_{s'}=a\\}$. Using time inversion, the first part corresponds to no hits of $y=au$ for $\\widehat{B}_u$ for $u>1$. The second part corresponds to a hit for some $u \\in [1/t, 1]$. The combination means the last hit happened in $[1/t, 1]$. This is exactly $\\{1/t \\le G_a \\le 1\\}$. More formally, we showed from the distribution of $L_a$ that for $t \\ge 1$, $\\mathbb{P}(G_a \\ge 1/t) = \\mathbb{P}(1 \\le \\tau_a \\le t)$.\n\nThus, for $t \\ge 1$, the representation can be decomposed as:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t) = \\mathbb{P}(L_a > 1) + \\mathbb{P}(G_a \\ge 1/t)\n$$\nwhere we have made the substitutions based on the time-inversion correspondence. This shows that $G_a$, the last exit before time $1$ for the inverted process, naturally corresponds to the probability mass of the first hitting time $\\tau_a$ occurring in the interval $[1,t]$.\nThe overall identity $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\le t) = \\mathbb{P}(L_a \\ge 1/t)$ holds for all $t>0$.

The martingale property with respect to a suitable inverted filtration.\n\n**Part 1: Adaptation of $(X_t)_{t>0}$ to the natural filtration $\\{\\mathcal{F}_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$**\n\nA stochastic process $(Y_t)$ is said to be adapted to a filtration $\\{\\mathcal{G}_t\\}$ if for every $t$ in the index set, the random variable $Y_t$ is $\\mathcal{G}_t$-measurable.\nIn this problem, the filtration is the natural filtration of the Brownian motion $(B_t)$, which is $\\mathcal{F}_t = \\sigma(B_s : 0 \\le s \\le t)$. This sigma-algebra represents the information available from observing the Brownian path up to time $t$. The process in question is $X_t = t B_{1/t}$.\n\nFor $(X_t)_{t>0}$ to be adapted to $\\{\\mathcal{F}_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$, the random variable $X_t$ must be $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable for all $t > 0$. Since $t$ is a deterministic constant, this is equivalent to the condition that $B_{1/t}$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable for all $t > 0$.\n\nLet's consider a time $t$ such that $0 < t < 1$. For such a $t$, we have $1/t > 1 > t$.\nThe random variable $B_{1/t}$ is determined by the value of the Brownian path at time $1/t$.\nThe filtration $\\mathcal{F}_t$ contains information about the Brownian path only up to time $t$.\nSince $1/t > t$, the increment $B_{1/t} - B_t$ is, by definition of Brownian motion, independent of the sigma-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_t$.\nWe can write $B_{1/t} = B_t + (B_{1/t} - B_t)$.\nIf $B_{1/t}$ were $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable, then the difference $B_{1/t} - B_t$ would also be $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable, as $B_t$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable by definition.\nHowever, $B_{1/t} - B_t$ is a non-degenerate random variable (its variance is $1/t - t > 0$) that is independent of $\\mathcal{F}_t$. A non-constant random variable cannot be independent of a sigma-algebra and also measurable with respect to it.\nTherefore, for any $t \\in (0,1)$, $B_{1/t}$ is not $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable. Consequently, $X_t = t B_{1/t}$ is not $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable.\n\nSince the condition of adaptation fails for $t \\in (0,1)$, the process $(X_t)_{t>0}$ is not adapted to the filtration $\\{\\mathcal{F}_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$.\n\n**Part 2: Martingale property of $(X_t)_{t>0}$**\n\nWe first establish that the process $(X_t)_{t>0}$ is itself a standard Brownian motion. A process is a standard Brownian motion if it is a centered Gaussian process with covariance function $\\operatorname{Cov}(X_s, X_t) = \\min(s,t)$.\nThe process $(B_t)$ is a centered Gaussian process, so any linear transformation of it, such as $(X_t)$, is also a centered Gaussian process. The expectation is $\\mathbb{E}[X_t] = \\mathbb{E}[t B_{1/t}] = t \\mathbb{E}[B_{1/t}] = t \\cdot 0 = 0$.\nThe covariance for $s, t > 0$ is:\n$$ \\operatorname{Cov}(X_s, X_t) = \\operatorname{Cov}(s B_{1/s}, t B_{1/t}) = st \\operatorname{Cov}(B_{1/s}, B_{1/t}) $$\nUsing the given property $\\operatorname{Cov}(B_a, B_b) = \\min(a,b)$, we get:\n$$ \\operatorname{Cov}(X_s, X_t) = st \\min(1/s, 1/t) $$\nLet's assume without loss of generality that $s \\le t$. This implies $1/s \\ge 1/t$, so $\\min(1/s, 1/t) = 1/t$.\n$$ \\operatorname{Cov}(X_s, X_t) = st(1/t) = s $$\nSince we assumed $s \\le t$, this is equivalent to $\\operatorname{Cov}(X_s, X_t) = \\min(s,t)$.\nThus, $(X_t)_{t>0}$ is a centered Gaussian process with the correct covariance structure, which means $(X_t)_{t>0}$ is a standard Brownian motion.\n\nA standard Brownian motion is a martingale with respect to its own natural filtration. Let's denote the natural filtration of $(X_t)$ by $\\{\\mathcal{F}^X_t\\}_{t>0}$, where $\\mathcal{F}^X_t := \\sigma(X_u : 0 < u \\le t)$.\nSo, $(X_t)_{t>0}$ is a martingale with respect to $\\{\\mathcal{F}^X_t\\}_{t>0}$.\n\nNow we must identify this filtration with one of the options. Let's analyze the filtration proposed in option B, $\\mathcal{H}_t := \\sigma(B_u : u \\ge 1/t)$.\nFirst, we check if this is a valid (i.e., non-decreasing) filtration. For $0 < s < t$, we have $1/s > 1/t$. The set of time indices for the generators of $\\mathcal{H}_s$ is $[1/s, \\infty)$, and for $\\mathcal{H}_t$ is $[1/t, \\infty)$. Since $[1/s, \\infty) \\subset [1/t, \\infty)$, the set of generators for $\\mathcal{H}_s$ is a subset of the generators for $\\mathcal{H}_t$. Thus, $\\mathcal{H}_s \\subseteq \\mathcal{H}_t$, and $\\{\\mathcal{H}_t\\}_{t>0}$ is a valid filtration.\n\nLet's relate $\\mathcal{F}^X_t$ to $\\mathcal{H}_t$.\n$$ \\mathcal{F}^X_t = \\sigma(X_u : 0 < u \\le t) = \\sigma(u B_{1/u} : 0 < u \\le t) $$\nLet's perform a change of variable $v = 1/u$. As $u$ ranges over $(0, t]$, $v$ ranges over $[1/t, \\infty)$.\n$$ \\mathcal{F}^X_t = \\sigma((1/v) B_v : v \\ge 1/t) $$\nThe sigma-algebra $\\sigma((1/v) B_v : v \\ge 1/t)$ is generated by the random variables $(1/v) B_v$ for all $v \\ge 1/t$. Since $v \\ge 1/t > 0$, the factor $1/v$ is a non-zero deterministic scalar for each generator. Therefore, this sigma-algebra is identical to the one generated by just $B_v$ for $v \\ge 1/t$:\n$$ \\sigma((1/v) B_v : v \\ge 1/t) = \\sigma(B_v : v \\ge 1/t) = \\mathcal{H}_t $$\nSo, we have shown that $\\mathcal{F}^X_t = \\mathcal{H}_t$. Since $(X_t)$ is a martingale with respect to its natural filtration $\\mathcal{F}^X_t$, it is a martingale with respect to $\\{\\mathcal{H}_t\\}_{t>0}$.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n\n**A. $(X_t)_{t>0}$ is adapted to $\\{\\mathcal{F}_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ and is a martingale with respect to $\\{\\mathcal{F}_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. As shown in Part 1, $(X_t)_{t>0}$ is not adapted to $\\{\\mathcal{F}_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$. Adaptation is a necessary condition for a process to be a martingale with respect to a given filtration.\n\n**B. $(X_t)_{t>0}$ is not adapted to $\\{\\mathcal{F}_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ because, for $t \\in (0,1)$, the random variable $X_t$ depends on $B_{1/t}$, which is not $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable; moreover, $(X_t)_{t>0}$ is a martingale with respect to the inverted filtration $\\{\\mathcal{H}_t\\}_{t>0}$ defined by $\\mathcal{H}_t := \\sigma(B_u : u \\ge 1/t)$.**\nThis is **Correct**. The explanation for the lack of adaptation is precisely what was derived in Part 1. The identification of the filtration $\\{\\mathcal{H}_t\\}_{t>0}$ and the martingale property with respect to it is precisely what was derived in Part 2.\n\n**C. $(X_t)_{t>0}$ is not adapted to $\\{\\mathcal{F}_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ and is a martingale with respect to $\\{\\mathcal{G}_t\\}_{t>0}$ defined by $\\mathcal{G}_t := \\sigma(B_u : u \\le 1/t)$.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. The family of sigma-algebras $\\{\\mathcal{G}_t\\}_{t>0}$ is a decreasing family (a backward filtration). For $0 < s < t$, $1/s > 1/t$, so $\\{u : u \\le 1/s\\}$ is a superset of $\\{u : u \\le 1/t\\}$, which means $\\mathcal{G}_s \\supseteq \\mathcal{G}_t$. A standard martingale is defined with respect to a non-decreasing filtration. Thus, $(X_t)$ cannot be a standard martingale with respect to $\\{\\mathcal{G}_t\\}_{t>0}$.\n\n**D. $(X_t)_{t>0}$ is adapted to $\\{\\mathcal{F}_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ for all $t \\ge 1$ but not for $t \\in (0,1)$, and it is a martingale with respect to $\\{\\mathcal{K}_t\\}_{t>0}$ defined by $\\mathcal{K}_t := \\sigma(B_{1/s} : s \\ge t)$.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. The statement about adaptation is correct. However, let's analyze the filtration $\\{\\mathcal{K}_t\\}_{t>0}$. For $0 < t_1 < t_2$, we have $\\{s : s \\ge t_1\\} \\supset \\{s : s \\ge t_2\\}$. The set of generators for $\\mathcal{K}_{t_1}$ is $\\{B_{1/s} : s \\ge t_1\\}$, and for $\\mathcal{K}_{t_2}$ is $\\{B_{1/s} : s \\ge t_2\\}$. The set of generators for $\\mathcal{K}_{t_1}$ is larger than that for $\\mathcal{K}_{t_2}$, so $\\mathcal{K}_{t_1} \\supseteq \\mathcal{K}_{t_2}$. This is a decreasing filtration, so $(X_t)$ cannot be a standard martingale with respect to it.\n\n**E. $(X_t)_{t>0}$ has Gaussian increments with variance $t^2$ and is therefore a martingale with respect to $\\{\\sigma(B_u : u \\ge 1/t)\\}_{t>0}$.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. The reasoning is flawed. The increment is $X_t - X_s$ for $s<t$. Its variance is $\\operatorname{Var}(X_t - X_s) = \\operatorname{Var}(X_t) + \\operatorname{Var}(X_s) - 2\\operatorname{Cov}(X_t, X_s)$. Since $(X_t)$ is a standard BM, this is $t + s - 2s = t-s$. The statement that the variance is $t^2$ is false (this would be $\\operatorname{Var}(X_t)$ if $B_{1/t}$ had variance $t$, which is also false). Furthermore, the logical step \"therefore\" is not justified; having Gaussian increments is not a sufficient condition for being a martingale. The conclusion happens to be correct (it is a martingale wrt that filtration), but the entire justification is wrong.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2994831"}]}
