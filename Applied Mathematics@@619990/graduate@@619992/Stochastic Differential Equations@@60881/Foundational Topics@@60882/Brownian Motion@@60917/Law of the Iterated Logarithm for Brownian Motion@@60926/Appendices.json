The closed unit ball in $\\mathcal{H}$ is defined as the set of all functions $g \\in \\mathcal{H}$ such that $\\|g\\|_{\\mathcal{H}} \\leq 1$.\n\nFirst, we must verify that the function $f_a(t) = at$ is an element of the Cameron-Martin space $\\mathcal{H}$.

Continuity on $[0,1]$: The function $f_a(t) = at$ is a linear function of $t$, which is continuous for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, $f_a \\in C[0,1]$.\n2.  Absolute continuity: The function $f_a(t)$ is differentiable everywhere on $[0,1]$, with a continuous derivative $f'_a(t) = a$. Any function with a continuous derivative on a closed interval is Lipschitz continuous, and any Lipschitz continuous function is absolutely continuous. Thus, $f_a(t)$ is absolutely continuous on $[0,1]$.\n3.  Initial condition: We evaluate $f_a(t)$ at $t=0$, which gives $f_a(0) = a \\cdot 0 = 0$. This matches the condition $f(0)=0$.\n4.  Finite energy condition: We must check if the integral of the square of its derivative is finite. The derivative of $f_a(t)$ with respect to $t$ is $f'_{a}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(at) = a$. The integral is\n$$ \\int_{0}^{1} (f'_{a}(t))^{2} \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{1} a^{2} \\, dt = a^{2} [t]_{0}^{1} = a^{2}(1 - 0) = a^{2} $$\nSince $a$ is a fixed real parameter, $a^2$ is a finite real number. Therefore, the condition $\\int_{0}^{1} (f'(t))^{2} \\, dt  \\infty$ is satisfied.\n\nSince all four conditions are met, the function $f_{a}(t)$ is an element of the Cameron-Martin space $\\mathcal{H}$ for any real value of $a$.\n\nNext, we compute the Cameron-Martin norm $\\|f_{a}\\|_{\\mathcal{H}}$. The norm is defined as\n$$ \\|f\\|_{\\mathcal{H}} = \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} (f'(t))^{2} \\, dt \\right)^{1/2} $$\nUsing our previous calculation of the integral, we can find the norm of $f_a(t)$:\n$$ \\|f_{a}\\|_{\\mathcal{H}} = \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} (f'_{a}(t))^{2} \\, dt \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( a^{2} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{a^{2}} = |a| $$\nThe Cameron-Martin norm of the function $f_{a}(t) = at$ is precisely the absolute value of the parameter $a$.\n\nFinally, we explain why $f_{a}$ lies in the cluster set if and only if $|a| \\leq 1$. As stated in the problem, the functional law of the iterated logarithm asserts that the cluster set for the rescaled Brownian motion paths is the closed unit ball of $\\mathcal{H}$. A function $g$ is in the closed unit ball of $\\mathcal{H}$ if and only if $g \\in \\mathcal{H}$ and its norm satisfies $\\|g\\|_{\\mathcal{H}} \\leq 1$.\nFor the specific function $f_a$, we have established that $f_a \\in \\mathcal{H}$ and that $\\|f_{a}\\|_{\\mathcal{H}} = |a|$. Therefore, the condition for $f_a$ to be in the cluster set is\n$$ \\|f_a\\|_{\\mathcal{H}} \\leq 1 $$\nwhich, upon substitution of our result for the norm, becomes\n$$ |a| \\leq 1 $$\nThis demonstrates that the function $f_a(t) = at$ is a limit point of the sequence of rescaled Brownian paths if and only if the parameter $a$ is in the interval $[-1, 1]$.\n\nThe problem asks for the exact analytic expression for the Cameron-Martin norm $\\|f_{a}\\|_{\\mathcal{H}}$.
