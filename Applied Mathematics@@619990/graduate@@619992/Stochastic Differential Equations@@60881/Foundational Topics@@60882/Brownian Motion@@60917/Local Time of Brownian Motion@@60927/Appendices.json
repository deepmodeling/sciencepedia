A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part solution. First, we derive the distributional scaling relation for the local time $L_t^0$. Second, we compute its expectation $E[L_t^0]$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Scaling Relation**\n\nWe start from the approximation definition of the local time at level $0$:\n$$L_t^0 = \\lim_{\\varepsilon\\downarrow 0} \\frac{1}{2\\varepsilon} \\int_0^t \\mathbf{1}_{\\{|B_s|\\le\\varepsilon\\}} \\, ds$$\nLet $c > 0$ be a constant. We consider the local time at time $ct$, denoted $L_{ct}^0$:\n$$L_{ct}^0 = \\lim_{\\varepsilon\\downarrow 0} \\frac{1}{2\\varepsilon} \\int_0^{ct} \\mathbf{1}_{\\{|B_s|\\le\\varepsilon\\}} \\, ds$$\nWe perform a change of variable in the integral, setting $s = cu$. This implies $ds = c \\, du$, and the limits of integration change from $s \\in [0, ct]$ to $u \\in [0, t]$.\n$$L_{ct}^0 = \\lim_{\\varepsilon\\downarrow 0} \\frac{1}{2\\varepsilon} \\int_0^t \\mathbf{1}_{\\{|B_{cu}|\\le\\varepsilon\\}} \\, (c \\, du) = c \\lim_{\\varepsilon\\downarrow 0} \\frac{1}{2\\varepsilon} \\int_0^t \\mathbf{1}_{\\{|B_{cu}|\\le\\varepsilon\\}} \\, du$$\nAccording to the Brownian scaling property, the process $W_u = B_{cu}/\\sqrt{c}$ for $u \\ge 0$ is a standard Brownian motion. From this, we have $B_{cu} = \\sqrt{c} W_u$. Substituting this into the expression gives:\n$$L_{ct}^0 = c \\lim_{\\varepsilon\\downarrow 0} \\frac{1}{2\\varepsilon} \\int_0^t \\mathbf{1}_{\\{|\\sqrt{c}W_u|\\le\\varepsilon\\}} \\, du$$\nThe inequality in the indicator function, $|\\sqrt{c}W_u|\\le\\varepsilon$, is equivalent to $|W_u|\\le\\varepsilon/\\sqrt{c}$. Let us introduce a new variable $\\delta = \\varepsilon/\\sqrt{c}$. As $\\varepsilon \\downarrow 0$, $\\delta \\downarrow 0$. We also have $\\varepsilon = \\delta\\sqrt{c}$. Substituting for $\\varepsilon$ and the inequality, we get:\n$$L_{ct}^0 = c \\lim_{\\delta\\downarrow 0} \\frac{1}{2(\\delta\\sqrt{c})} \\int_0^t \\mathbf{1}_{\\{|W_u|\\le\\delta\\}} \\, du$$\nFactoring out the constants:\n$$L_{ct}^0 = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{c}} \\lim_{\\delta\\downarrow 0} \\frac{1}{2\\delta} \\int_0^t \\mathbf{1}_{\\{|W_u|\\le\\delta\\}} \\, du = \\sqrt{c} \\left( \\lim_{\\delta\\downarrow 0} \\frac{1}{2\\delta} \\int_0^t \\mathbf{1}_{\\{|W_u|\\le\\delta\\}} \\, du \\right)$$\nThe expression within the parentheses is, by definition, the local time at $0$ up to time $t$ for the standard Brownian motion $W$, which we can denote by $\\tilde{L}_t^0$. Thus, we have the identity $L_{ct}^0 = \\sqrt{c} \\tilde{L}_t^0$.\nSince $W=\\{W_u\\}$ is a standard Brownian motion, its law is identical to that of $B=\\{B_u\\}$. Therefore, the random variable $\\tilde{L}_t^0$ has the same distribution as $L_t^0$. This leads to the distributional scaling relation:\n$$L_{ct}^0 \\stackrel{d}{=} \\sqrt{c} L_t^0$$\n\n**Part 2: Computation of $E[L_t^0]$**\n\nWe use Tanaka's formula, which is an extension of Itô's formula to the convex function $f(x)=|x|$. For a standard Brownian motion $B_t$ starting at $B_0=0$, Tanaka's formula is:\n$$|B_t| - |B_0| = \\int_0^t \\text{sgn}(B_s) \\, dB_s + L_t^0$$\nWith $B_0=0$ almost surely, this simplifies to:\n$$|B_t| = \\int_0^t \\text{sgn}(B_s) \\, dB_s + L_t^0$$\nTo find $E[L_t^0]$, we take the expectation of both sides:\n$$E[|B_t|] = E\\left[\\int_0^t \\text{sgn}(B_s) \\, dB_s\\right] + E[L_t^0]$$\nThe term $M_t = \\int_0^t \\text{sgn}(B_s) \\, dB_s$ is an Itô integral. The integrand $h(s) = \\text{sgn}(B_s)$ is a predictable process. We verify the martingale condition:\n$$E\\left[\\int_0^t h(s)^2 \\, ds\\right] = E\\left[\\int_0^t (\\text{sgn}(B_s))^2 \\, ds\\right]$$\nThe set of times $s$ for which $B_s=0$ has Lebesgue measure zero almost surely. For all other times, $(\\text{sgn}(B_s))^2 = 1$. Thus, $\\int_0^t (\\text{sgn}(B_s))^2 \\, ds = \\int_0^t 1 \\, ds = t$ almost surely. The expectation is $E[t] = t$, which is finite for any $t \\ge 0$.\nTherefore, $M_t$ is a true martingale, and since $M_0=0$, its expectation is zero for all $t$: $E[M_t] = E[M_0] = 0$.\nSubstituting this into the expectation equation:\n$$E[|B_t|] = 0 + E[L_t^0]$$\nThis gives us the relation $E[L_t^0] = E[|B_t|]$. The problem is reduced to computing the expectation of the absolute value of $B_t$. For a fixed $t > 0$, $B_t$ is a normally distributed random variable with mean $0$ and variance $t$, denoted $B_t \\sim N(0, t)$. Its probability density function (PDF) is:\n$$f_t(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2t}\\right)$$\nWe compute the expectation of $|B_t|$ by integrating over its PDF:\n$$E[|B_t|] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |x| f_t(x) \\, dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |x| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2t}\\right) \\, dx$$\nThe integrand is an even function, so we can write:\n$$E[|B_t|] = 2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2t}\\right) \\, dx$$\nWe perform a change of variable $u = \\frac{x^2}{2t}$. This gives $du = \\frac{x}{t} \\, dx$, so $x \\, dx = t \\, du$. The integration limits for $u$ are from $0$ to $\\infty$.\n$$E[|B_t|] = 2 \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u) \\, (t \\, du) = \\frac{2t}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u) \\, du$$\nThe definite integral is $\\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-u) \\, du = 1$. So, we have:\n$$E[|B_t|] = \\frac{2t}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} = \\frac{2t}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sqrt{t}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{t}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4t}{2\\pi}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2t}{\\pi}}$$\nTherefore, the expectation of the local time at $0$ is:\n$$E[L_t^0] = \\sqrt{\\frac{2t}{\\pi}}$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{2t}{\\pi}}}$$", "id": "2985712"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond the first moment, this exercise delves into the complete probability distribution of the local time.

The local time of $B$ at level $0$ up to time $t$, denoted $L_{t}^{0}(B)$, is formally defined by the Tanaka-Meyer formula. For any convex function $f$, Itô's formula generalizes to\n$$f(B_t) - f(B_0) = \\int_0^t f'(B_s) dB_s + \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^t f''(B_s) ds$$\nfor $C^2$ functions. For functions which are not $C^2$, such as $f(y) = |y-a|$, the formula must be modified to include a local time term. For the absolute value function $f(y) = |y|$, which is convex but not differentiable at $y=0$, the Tanaka formula gives:\n$$|B_{t}| - |B_{0}| = \\int_{0}^{t} \\text{sgn}(B_{s}) dB_{s} + L_{t}^{0}(B)$$\nwhere $\\text{sgn}(y)$ is the sign function, defined as $1$ for $y>0$, $-1$ for $y<0$, and $0$ for $y=0$. Since $B_0=0$ almost surely, this simplifies to:\n$$|B_{t}| = \\int_{0}^{t} \\text{sgn}(B_{s}) dB_{s} + L_{t}^{0}(B)$$\nThe process $L_t^0(B)$ is a continuous, non-decreasing process that increases only on the set $\\{s \\in [0,t]: B_s = 0\\}$. The stochastic integral $M_t = \\int_{0}^{t} \\text{sgn}(B_{s}) dB_{s}$ is a continuous local martingale.

By Lévy's characterization of Brownian motion, any continuous martingale starting at $0$ with quadratic variation $t$ must be a standard Brownian motion. Thus, the process $M_t$ is itself a standard Brownian motion.\n\nThe problem requires finding $\\mathbb{P}\\{L_{t}^{0}(B)>x\\}$ by comparing $L_t^0(B)$ with the running supremum $S_{t}=\\sup_{0 \\leq s \\leq t} B_{s}$. The most profound and direct comparison is provided by a celebrated result of Paul Lévy, which establishes an identity in distribution between the pair $(|B_t|, L_t^0(B))$ and the pair $(S_t-B_t, S_t)$. That is,\n$$(|B_{t}|, L_{t}^{0}(B)) \\stackrel{d}{=} (S_{t}-B_{t}, S_{t})$$\nThis identity is justified by recognizing that both $|B_t|$ and $S_t-B_t$ are reflected Brownian motions. The process $X_t = |B_t|$ is a Brownian motion reflected at $0$, with $L_t^0(B)$ being its reflection term (local time at the boundary). Similarly, the process $Y_t = S_t - B_t$ is also a Brownian motion reflected at $0$, with $S_t$ acting as its reflection term. Lévy's result states that the laws of these two-dimensional processes are identical.\n\nA direct consequence of this joint identity in law is the equality of the marginal distributions. Specifically, for the second components, we have:\n$$L_{t}^{0}(B) \\stackrel{d}{=} S_{t}$$\nThis equality in law provides the sharpest possible comparison. It implies that for any measurable set $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}$, $\\mathbb{P}\\{L_{t}^{0}(B) \\in A\\} = \\mathbb{P}\\{S_{t} \\in A\\}$. In particular, their tail probabilities are identical for any $x>0$:\n$$\\mathbb{P}\\{L_{t}^{0}(B)>x\\} = \\mathbb{P}\\{S_{t}>x\\}$$\nOur task now reduces to calculating $\\mathbb{P}\\{S_{t}>x\\}$. Since $S_t$ is a continuous random variable, $\\mathbb{P}\\{S_{t}>x\\} = \\mathbb{P}\\{S_{t} \\geq x\\}$. We can calculate this probability using the reflection principle for Brownian motion.\n\nThe event $\\{S_{t} \\geq x\\}$ is equivalent to the event that the Brownian path reaches or exceeds the level $x$ at some time $s \\in [0,t]$. Let $\\tau_{x} = \\inf\\{s \\geq 0: B_{s}=x\\}$ be the first passage time to level $x$. Then $\\{S_{t} \\geq x\\} = \\{\\tau_{x} \\leq t\\}$.\nWe can decompose this event based on the value of $B_t$:\n$$\\mathbb{P}\\{S_{t} \\geq x\\} = \\mathbb{P}\\{S_{t} \\geq x, B_{t} > x\\} + \\mathbb{P}\\{S_{t} \\geq x, B_{t} < x\\} + \\mathbb{P}\\{S_{t} \\geq x, B_{t} = x\\}$$\nSince $B_t$ has a continuous probability distribution, $\\mathbb{P}\\{B_{t}=x\\}=0$, so the third term is zero.\nIf $B_{t} > x$, then its supremum up to time $t$ must also be greater than $x$, i.e., $S_t \\ge B_t > x$. Thus, the event $\\{S_{t} \\geq x, B_{t} > x\\}$ is identical to the event $\\{B_{t} > x\\}$. Therefore:\n$$\\mathbb{P}\\{S_{t} \\geq x, B_{t} > x\\} = \\mathbb{P}\\{B_{t} > x\\}$$\nFor the second term, $\\mathbb{P}\\{S_{t} \\geq x, B_{t} < x\\}$, we invoke the reflection principle. On the event $\\{\\tau_x \\le t\\}$, we define a new process $B'_s$ by reflecting the path of $B_s$ about the line $y=x$ after time $\\tau_x$:\n$$\nB'_{s} = \n\\begin{cases}\nB_{s} & \\text{if } s \\leq \\tau_{x} \\\\\n2x - B_{s} & \\text{if } s > \\tau_{x}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nBy the strong Markov property of Brownian motion, $B'_s$ is also a standard Brownian motion. The event $\\{S_{t} \\geq x, B_{t} < x\\}$ for the original process $B$ corresponds to the event $\\{S'_{t} \\geq x, B'_{t} > x\\}$ for the reflected process $B'$. Since for $B'$, $B'_t > x$ implies $S'_t \\ge B'_t > x$, this is simply $\\{B'_{t} > x\\}$.\nThe mapping from the paths of $B$ to the paths of $B'$ is measure-preserving. Therefore:\n$$\\mathbb{P}\\{S_{t} \\geq x, B_{t} < x\\} = \\mathbb{P}\\{B'_{t} > x\\}$$\nSince $B'$ and $B$ have the same distribution, $\\mathbb{P}\\{B'_{t} > x\\} = \\mathbb{P}\\{B_{t} > x\\}$.\nCombining these results, we get:\n$$\\mathbb{P}\\{S_{t} \\geq x\\} = \\mathbb{P}\\{B_{t} > x\\} + \\mathbb{P}\\{B_{t} > x\\} = 2\\mathbb{P}\\{B_{t} > x\\}$$\nThe random variable $B_{t}$ is normally distributed with mean $0$ and variance $t$, i.e., $B_{t} \\sim N(0,t)$.

For $n=0$, we have $m_{0}(x) = \\mathbb{E}[Z_{x}^{0}] = \\mathbb{E}[1] = 1$ for all $x \\geq 0$ (since $Z_x$ is a non-negative process, $Z_x=0$ only at $x=0$ with probability $1$).\n\nWe can now solve this system recursively.\nFor $n=1$:\n$$\nm_{1}'(x) = 2(1^2)m_{0}(x) = 2(1) = 2\n$$\nIntegrating with respect to $x$ and applying the initial condition $m_{1}(0)=0$:\n$$\nm_{1}(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} 2 \\, ds = 2x\n$$\nThis is the base case for our induction. Now, assume as the induction hypothesis that for some integer $k \\geq 1$, the $(k-1)$-th moment is given by $m_{k-1}(x) = (k-1)! (2x)^{k-1}$. Let us derive the formula for $m_{k}(x)$.\nFrom the recurrence relation:\n$$\nm_{k}'(x) = 2k^2 m_{k-1}(x) = 2k^2 \\left( (k-1)! (2s)^{k-1} \\right)\n$$\nNote: inside the integral, we should use a dummy variable $s$.\n$$\nm_{k}(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} m_{k}'(s) \\, ds + m_{k}(0) = \\int_{0}^{x} 2k^2 m_{k-1}(s) \\, ds + 0\n$$\nSubstituting the inductive hypothesis for $m_{k-1}(s)$:\n$$\nm_{k}(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} 2k^2 \\left[ (k-1)! (2s)^{k-1} \\right] \\, ds\n$$\n$$\nm_{k}(x) = 2k^2 (k-1)! 2^{k-1} \\int_{0}^{x} s^{k-1} \\, ds\n$$\nRecognizing that $k(k-1)! = k!$:\n$$\nm_{k}(x) = 2k \\cdot k! \\cdot 2^{k-1} \\left[ \\frac{s^k}{k} \\right]_{0}^{x}\n$$\n$$\nm_{k}(x) = 2k \\cdot k! \\cdot 2^{k-1} \\cdot \\frac{x^k}{k}\n$$\n$$\nm_{k}(x) = 2 \\cdot k! \\cdot 2^{k-1} \\cdot x^k = k! \\cdot 2^k \\cdot x^k = k! (2x)^k\n$$\nThe formula holds for $k$ if it holds for $k-1$. We have already shown the base case for $k=1$, $m_1(x) = 1!(2x)^1 = 2x$. Thus, by mathematical induction, the formula for the $n$-th moment is:\n$$\nm_n(x) = \\mathbb{E}[Z_x^n] = n! (2x)^n\n$$\nfor all positive integers $n$.\n\nFinally, we substitute $x = b-a$ to find the desired expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\big[(L_{\\tau_{b}}^{a})^{n}\\big] = m_{n}(b-a) = n! (2(b-a))^n\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the $n$-th moment of the local time at level $a$ up to the hitting time of $b$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{n! (2(b-a))^{n}}$$", "id": "2985747"}]}
