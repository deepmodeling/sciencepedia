For any $s  t$, we must show that $\\mathbb{E}_{x}[W_{t} | \\mathcal{F}_{s}] = W_{s}$.\nBy the properties of conditional expectation and the definition of Brownian motion, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{x}[W_{t} | \\mathcal{F}_{s}] = \\mathbb{E}_{x}[W_{s} + (W_{t} - W_{s}) | \\mathcal{F}_{s}] = W_{s} + \\mathbb{E}_{x}[W_{t} - W_{s} | \\mathcal{F}_{s}]\n$$\nThe increment $W_{t} - W_{s}$ is independent of the past information contained in $\\mathcal{F}_{s}$. Therefore, the conditional expectation is equal to the unconditional expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{x}[W_{t} - W_{s} | \\mathcal{F}_{s}] = \\mathbb{E}_{x}[W_{t} - W_{s}]\n$$\nA standard Brownian motion has increments with mean zero, so $\\mathbb{E}_{x}[W_{t} - W_{s}] = 0$. Thus, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{x}[W_{t} | \\mathcal{F}_{s}] = W_{s} + 0 = W_{s}\n$$\nThis confirms that $\\{W_{t}\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ is a martingale under $\\mathbb{P}_{x}$.\n\nNext, we define the stopping time $\\tau = \\tau_{a} \\wedge \\tau_{b}$. This is the first time the process $W_{t}$ exits the open interval $(a,b)$. To verify that $\\tau$ is a stopping time, we must show that the event $\\{\\tau \\le t\\}$ is in $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$ for all $t \\ge 0$. The event $\\{\\tau \\le t\\}$ can be written as:\n$$\n\\{\\tau \\le t\\} = \\{ \\inf_{0 \\le s \\le t} W_{s} \\le a \\} \\cup \\{ \\sup_{0 \\le s \\le t} W_{s} \\ge b \\}\n$$\nSince the paths of a Brownian motion are continuous functions, the infimum and supremum over a closed interval $[0,t]$ are $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$-measurable random variables. The union of two $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$-measurable sets is also $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$-measurable. Hence, $\\tau$ is a stopping time with respect to $\\{\\mathcal{F}_{t}\\}$.\n\nWe now apply the Optional Stopping Theorem. The theorem states that for a martingale $M_{t}$ and a stopping time $T$, under certain conditions, $\\mathbb{E}[M_{T}] = \\mathbb{E}[M_{0}]$. We must justify that these conditions hold for $M_{t} = W_{t}$ and $T = \\tau$.\nA sufficient set of conditions is that $\\mathbb{P}_{x}(\\tau  \\infty) = 1$ and that the stopped process $W_{t \\wedge \\tau}$ is uniformly integrable.\n\nThe probability that a one-dimensional Brownian motion remains within a finite interval for all time is zero. That is, $\\mathbb{P}_{x}(\\tau = \\infty) = 0$, which implies $\\mathbb{P}_{x}(\\tau  \\infty) = 1$.\n\nNow, we examine the stopped process $\\{W_{t \\wedge \\tau}\\}_{t \\ge 0}$. For any time $s  \\tau$, by the definition of $\\tau$, the process value $W_{s}$ is strictly between $a$ and $b$. Due to the continuity of Brownian paths, at the very instant of stopping, $W_{\\tau}$ must be equal to either $a$ or $b$. Consequently, for any $t \\ge 0$, the value of the stopped process $W_{t \\wedge \\tau}$ is always contained in the closed interval $[a,b]$. This means the random variables $W_{t \\wedge \\tau}$ are uniformly bounded:\n$$\na \\le W_{t \\wedge \\tau} \\le b \\quad \\forall t \\ge 0\n$$\nwhich implies $|W_{t \\wedge \\tau}| \\le \\max(|a|,|b|)$. A family of random variables that is uniformly bounded is also uniformly integrable. Doob's Optional Stopping Theorem in one of its common forms states that for a uniformly integrable martingale, the expectation is preserved at a stopping time.\nAlternatively, and more directly, we can use a limiting argument. For any fixed time $T_{0} > 0$, the stopped process $W_{t \\wedge T_{0}}$ is a bounded martingale, so $\\mathbb{E}_{x}[W_{T_{0} \\wedge \\tau}] = \\mathbb{E}_{x}[W_{0}] = x$. We wish to let $T_{0} \\to \\infty$. We have established that $\\tau  \\infty$ almost surely, so as $T_{0} \\to \\infty$, $T_{0} \\wedge \\tau \\to \\tau$ almost surely. By the path continuity of Brownian motion, $W_{T_{0} \\wedge \\tau} \\to W_{\\tau}$ almost surely.\nSince the random variables $\\{W_{T_{0} \\wedge \\tau}\\}_{T_{0} \\ge 0}$ are uniformly bounded by $\\max(|a|,|b|)$, we can apply the Bounded Convergence Theorem to exchange the limit and expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{x}[W_{\\tau}] = \\mathbb{E}_{x}[\\lim_{T_{0} \\to \\infty} W_{T_{0} \\wedge \\tau}] = \\lim_{T_{0} \\to \\infty} \\mathbb{E}_{x}[W_{T_{0} \\wedge \\tau}]\n$$\nSince $\\mathbb{E}_{x}[W_{T_{0} \\wedge \\tau}] = x$ for all $T_{0}$, the limit is also $x$. Therefore, we have established:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{x}[W_{\\tau}] = x\n$$\nNow, we compute this expectation in another way. The random variable $W_{\\tau}$ can only take values $a$ or $b$ (the event $\\tau_{a} = \\tau_{b}$ has probability $0$). Its distribution is given by:\n$\\mathbb{P}_{x}(W_{\\tau} = a) = \\mathbb{P}_{x}(\\tau_{a}  \\tau_{b}) = p(x)$\n$\\mathbb{P}_{x}(W_{\\tau} = b) = \\mathbb{P}_{x}(\\tau_{b} \\le \\tau_{a}) = 1 - p(x)$\nThe expectation of $W_{\\tau}$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{x}[W_{\\tau}] = a \\cdot \\mathbb{P}_{x}(W_{\\tau} = a) + b \\cdot \\mathbb{P}_{x}(W_{\\tau} = b) = a \\cdot p(x) + b \\cdot (1 - p(x))\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for $\\mathbb{E}_{x}[W_{\\tau}]$:\n$$\nx = a \\cdot p(x) + b - b \\cdot p(x)\n$$\nWe now solve for $p(x)$:\n$$\nx - b = p(x) (a - b)\n$$\n$$\np(x) = \\frac{x-b}{a-b}\n$$\nThis expression can be simplified by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $-1$:\n$$\np(x) = \\frac{-(b-x)}{-(b-a)} = \\frac{b-x}{b-a}\n$$\nThis is the analytic expression for the probability $\\mathbb{P}_{x}(\\tau_{a}  \\tau_{b})$. We can rewrite this expression as:\n$$\np(x) = \\left(\\frac{-1}{b-a}\\right)x + \\frac{b}{b-a}\n$$\nThis shows that $p(x)$ is a linear function of the starting position $x$. The slope is $\\frac{-1}{b-a}$ and the intercept is $\\frac{b}{b-a}$.

Let $\\tau_a = \\inf\\{s \\ge 0 : B_s = a\\}$. The paths of a Brownian motion are continuous almost surely.

The function of interest is $u(y) = \\mathbb{E}_y[\\tau_{(a,b)}]$, where $\\tau_{(a,b)} = \\inf\\{ t \\ge 0 : B_t \\notin (a,b) \\}$. We are asked to derive the boundary value problem (BVP) that $u(y)$ satisfies, solve it, and provide the specific value $u(x)$.\n\nFirst, we derive the boundary value problem for $u(y)$. This consists of a differential equation on the interval $(a,b)$ and conditions at the boundaries $a$ and $b$.\n\nThe boundary conditions are determined by the definition of the stopping time $\\tau_{(a,b)}$. If the process starts at a boundary point, for instance $y=a$, it is already outside the open interval $(a,b)$. Thus, the first time $t \\ge 0$ for which $B_t \\notin (a,b)$ is $t=0$. Therefore, $\\tau_{(a,b)} = 0$ if the starting point is $a$ or $b$.

We use the strong Markov property. Let $\\tau_h = \\inf\\{t \\ge 0 : |B_t - y| \\ge \\epsilon\\}$ be the first exit time from the interval $(y-\\epsilon, y+\\epsilon)$ for a small $\\epsilon  0$ such that $(y-\\epsilon, y+\\epsilon) \\subset (a,b)$.

We determine them using the boundary conditions:\n$$ u(a) = -a^2 + C_1 a + C_2 = 0 $$\n$$ u(b) = -b^2 + C_1 b + C_2 = 0 $$\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives:\n$$ (-b^2 + a^2) + C_1(b-a) = 0 $$\n$$ -(b-a)(b+a) + C_1(b-a) = 0 $$\nSince $a  b$, $b-a \\neq 0$, so we can divide by $(b-a)$:\n$$ -(b+a) + C_1 = 0 \\implies C_1 = a+b $$\nSubstituting $C_1$ into the first boundary condition equation:\n$$ -a^2 + (a+b)a + C_2 = 0 \\implies -a^2 + a^2 + ab + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = -ab $$\nThe solution to the BVP is:\n$$ u(y) = -y^2 + (a+b)y - ab $$\nThis can be factored as:\n$$ u(y) = -(y^2 - (a+b)y + ab) = -(y-a)(y-b) = (y-a)(b-y) $$\nLet us denote this candidate solution by $v(y) = (y-a)(b-y)$.\n\nTo rigorously confirm this result using Dynkin's formula, we show that $v(y)$ is indeed equal to $\\mathbb{E}_y[\\tau_{(a,b)}]$. The function $v(y)$ is in $C^2(\\mathbb{R})$ and satisfies the BVP. The infinitesimal generator acting on $v$ is $\\mathcal{L}v(y) = \\frac{1}{2}v''(y) = \\frac{1}{2}(-2) = -1$. Let $\\tau = \\tau_{(a,b)}$ and consider the bounded stopping time $\\tau_t = \\min(t, \\tau)$. By Dynkin's formula applied to $v(y)$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}_y[v(B_{\\tau_t})] = v(y) + \\mathbb{E}_y\\left[ \\int_0^{\\tau_t} (\\mathcal{L}v)(B_s) ds \\right] $$\nSubstituting $\\mathcal{L}v = -1$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}_y[v(B_{\\tau_t})] = v(y) + \\mathbb{E}_y\\left[ \\int_0^{\\tau_t} (-1) ds \\right] = v(y) - \\mathbb{E}_y[\\tau_t] $$\nRearranging, we get an expression for the expected stopped time:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}_y[\\tau_t] = v(y) - \\mathbb{E}_y[v(B_{\\tau_t})] $$\nNow, we take the limit as $t \\to \\infty$. On the left side, $\\tau_t \\uparrow \\tau$ as $t \\to \\infty$. By the Monotone Convergence Theorem, $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\mathbb{E}_y[\\tau_t] = \\mathbb{E}_y[\\tau] = u(y)$.\nOn the right side, as $t \\to \\infty$, $B_{\\tau_t} \\to B_\\tau$ almost surely. Since $v$ is continuous, $v(B_{\\tau_t}) \\to v(B_\\tau)$ almost surely. Upon exit, $B_\\tau \\in \\{a,b\\}$. The function $v(y)$ is constructed to be zero at the boundaries: $v(a)=0$ and $v(b)=0$. Therefore, $v(B_\\tau) = 0$ almost surely. The function $v(y)$ is bounded on $[a,b]$, so we can apply the Dominated Convergence Theorem:\n$$ \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\mathbb{E}_y[v(B_{\\tau_t})] = \\mathbb{E}_y[\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} v(B_{\\tau_t})] = \\mathbb{E}_y[v(B_\\tau)] = \\mathbb{E}_y[0] = 0 $$\nTaking the limit of the entire equation gives:\n$$ u(y) = v(y) - 0 = v(y) $$\nThis confirms that our solution to the BVP, $v(y)=(y-a)(b-y)$, is indeed the desired expected exit time $u(y)$.\n\nThe problem specifies the starting point as $x \\in (a,b)$. So we substitute $y=x$ into our derived expression for $u(y)$:\n$$ u(x) = (x-a)(b-x) $$\nThis is the explicit expression for the expected first exit time.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{(x-a)(b-x)}\n$$", "id": "2986589"}]}
