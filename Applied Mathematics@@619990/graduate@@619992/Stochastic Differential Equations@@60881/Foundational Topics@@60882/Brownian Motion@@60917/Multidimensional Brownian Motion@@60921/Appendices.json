This hypothetical problem concerning \"exciton annihilation\" introduces two crucial ideas in the theory of multidimensional Brownian motion. First, it demonstrates a powerful reduction technique where the relative motion of two independent Brownian particles is itself a Brownian motion. Second, it requires you to engage with the concept of transience—the property of Brownian motion in dimensions $D \\ge 3$ to escape to infinity with non-zero probability—which is essential for correctly calculating hitting probabilities in unbounded domains [@problem_id:1306775].", "problem": "In a theoretical study of exotic semiconductor materials, physicists model the behavior of quasiparticles called excitons. In a particular $D$-dimensional crystalline material, the random thermal motion of an exciton can be accurately described as a standard $D$-dimensional Brownian motion.\n\nSuppose at time $t=0$, two excitons, Exciton A and Exciton B, are created at positions $x_A$ and $x_B$ in $\\mathbb{R}^D$, respectively. Their subsequent motions are independent of each other. The initial distance between them is $|x_A - x_B| = d$.\n\nThese excitons can undergo a process known as Auger recombination, where they annihilate each other. This event is modeled to occur instantaneously and with certainty if the distance between them ever becomes less than or equal to a critical capture radius $r$, where $0 < r < d$.\n\nFor a specific material where the effective dimension is $D=5$, determine the probability that the two excitons will eventually annihilate. Express your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $d$ and $r$.", "solution": "Let the positions of the two excitons at time $t$ be denoted by the random vectors $X_t$ and $Y_t$ in $\\mathbb{R}^5$. According to the problem statement, $X_t$ and $Y_t$ are independent, 5-dimensional standard Brownian motions. Their initial positions are $X_0 = x_A$ and $Y_0 = x_B$, with the initial condition $|x_A - x_B| = d$. Annihilation occurs if $|X_t - Y_t| \\le r$ for some time $t > 0$.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to analyze the relative motion of the two excitons. Let's define a new process $Z_t = X_t - Y_t$, which represents the vector from Exciton B to Exciton A. The initial state of this process is $Z_0 = x_A - x_B$, so its magnitude is $|Z_0| = d$. The annihilation condition is now simply that the magnitude of $Z_t$ ever reaches the value $r$, i.e., $|Z_t| \\le r$.\n\nSince $X_t$ and $Y_t$ are independent standard Brownian motions, their linear combination $Z_t$ is also a Brownian motion. Let's determine its parameters. $Z_t$ is a Gaussian process with mean $E[Z_t] = E[X_t] - E[Y_t] = 0 - 0 = 0$. For any component $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, the variance is $\\text{Var}(Z_{t,i}) = \\text{Var}(X_{t,i} - Y_{t,i})$. Due to the independence of $X_t$ and $Y_t$, this becomes $\\text{Var}(X_{t,i}) + \\text{Var}(Y_{t,i}) = t + t = 2t$.\nThis means that $Z_t$ is a 5-dimensional Brownian motion where each component has variance $2t$. We can express this as $Z_t = \\sqrt{2} \\tilde{B}_t$, where $\\tilde{B}_t$ is a 5-dimensional *standard* Brownian motion (whose components have variance $t$).\n\nThe problem is now transformed into finding the probability that the process $Z_t$ starting at $|Z_0| = d$ will ever enter the ball of radius $r$. This is equivalent to finding the probability that the standard Brownian motion $\\tilde{B}_t = Z_t/\\sqrt{2}$, starting at $|\\tilde{B}_0| = |Z_0|/\\sqrt{2} = d/\\sqrt{2}$, ever enters the ball of radius $\\rho = r/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nFor a standard Brownian motion in $D$ dimensions where $D \\ge 3$, the process is transient, meaning it has a non-zero probability of escaping to infinity. The probability of hitting a sphere of radius $\\rho$ starting from a point $z_0$ with $|z_0| > \\rho$ is less than 1. This probability, let's call it $P(z_0)$, is a harmonic function with respect to the Laplacian operator $\\Delta$, satisfying the exterior Dirichlet problem:\n1. $\\Delta P(z) = 0$ for $|z| > \\rho$.\n2. $P(z) = 1$ for $|z| = \\rho$ (if it starts on the boundary, it has hit it with probability 1).\n3. $P(z) \\to 0$ as $|z| \\to \\infty$ (due to the transient nature of the random walk).\n\nGiven the spherical symmetry of the boundary conditions, the solution $P(z)$ must be radially symmetric, i.e., $P(z) = p(|z|)$. Let $R = |z|$. The Laplacian in $D$ dimensions for a radially symmetric function is $\\Delta p(R) = p''(R) + \\frac{D-1}{R} p'(R)$.\nSetting $\\Delta p = 0$ gives the ordinary differential equation:\n$$p''(R) + \\frac{D-1}{R} p'(R) = 0$$\nLet $q(R) = p'(R)$. The equation becomes $q'(R) = -\\frac{D-1}{R} q(R)$, which is a separable equation.\n$$\\frac{dq}{q} = -\\frac{D-1}{R} dR$$\nIntegrating both sides yields $\\ln|q| = -(D-1)\\ln|R| + C_1$, which implies $q(R) = A R^{-(D-1)}$ for some constant $A$.\nNow, we integrate $p'(R) = q(R)$ to find $p(R)$. For $D \\ne 2$:\n$$p(R) = \\int A R^{-(D-1)} dR = \\frac{A}{2-D} R^{2-D} + B$$\nLet $C = A/(2-D)$. So, $p(R) = C R^{2-D} + B$.\nNow we apply the boundary conditions for our case, where $D=5$.\n1. As $R \\to \\infty$, $p(R) \\to 0$. Since $2-D = -3 < 0$, $R^{-3} \\to 0$ as $R \\to \\infty$. This implies that the constant $B$ must be 0. So, $p(R) = C R^{2-D}$.\n2. At $R = \\rho$, $p(\\rho) = 1$. This gives $1 = C \\rho^{2-D}$, so $C = \\rho^{D-2}$.\n\nThe final form of the hitting probability is $p(R) = (\\rho/R)^{D-2}$.\n\nWe can now substitute the specific values for our problem. We are in $D=5$. The starting radius for the standard Brownian motion $\\tilde{B}_t$ is $R = d/\\sqrt{2}$ and the target radius is $\\rho = r/\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe probability of annihilation is therefore:\n$$P_\\text{annihilate} = p(d/\\sqrt{2}) = \\left(\\frac{\\rho}{R}\\right)^{D-2} = \\left(\\frac{r/\\sqrt{2}}{d/\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^{5-2} = \\left(\\frac{r}{d}\\right)^3$$\nThe factors of $\\sqrt{2}$ cancel, and the final probability depends only on the ratio of the capture radius to the initial separation distance, raised to the power of $D-2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{r}{d}\\right)^{3}}$$", "id": "1306775"}]}
