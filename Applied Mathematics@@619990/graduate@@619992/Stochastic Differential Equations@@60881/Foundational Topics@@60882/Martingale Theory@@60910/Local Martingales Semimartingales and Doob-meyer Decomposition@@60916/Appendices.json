We proceed to solve the two tasks as specified.\n\n### Task 1: Quadratic Variations of a Standard Brownian Motion\n\nWe are asked to determine the quadratic variation $[W]_{t}$ and predictable quadratic variation $\\langle W \\rangle_{t}$ for a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion $W=(W_{t})_{t \\ge 0}$, where $W_{0}=0$. The tools are restricted to the foundational definitions and the Itô formula applied to the function $f(x) = x^{2}$.\n\nLet us apply the Itô formula to the process $f(W_{t}) = W_{t}^{2}$. The general differential form of Itô's formula for a function $f(X_{t})$ of a continuous semimartingale $X_{t}$ is\n$$\ndf(X_{t}) = f'(X_{t})\\,dX_{t} + \\frac{1}{2}f''(X_{t})\\,d[X]_{t}.\n$$\nIn our case, $X_{t} = W_{t}$, $f(x) = x^{2}$, so $f'(x) = 2x$ and $f''(x) = 2$. Substituting these into the formula yields:\n$$\nd(W_{t}^{2}) = 2W_{t}\\,dW_{t} + \\frac{1}{2}(2)\\,d[W]_{t} = 2W_{t}\\,dW_{t} + d[W]_{t}.\n$$\nA foundational property of standard Brownian motion, which can be derived from its definition as a limit of random walks or from its scaling properties, is that its quadratic variation process is $[W]_{t} = t$. The Itô rule $(dW_{t})^{2} = dt$ is a common shorthand for this fact. Applying this rule, we have $d[W]_{t} = dt$. The Itô formula for $W_{t}^{2}$ thus becomes:\n$$\nd(W_{t}^{2}) = 2W_{t}\\,dW_{t} + dt.\n$$\nIntegrating this stochastic differential equation from $s=0$ to $s=t$ gives\n$$\nW_{t}^{2} - W_{0}^{2} = \\int_{0}^{t} 2W_{s}\\,dW_{s} + \\int_{0}^{t} ds.\n$$\nSince $W$ is a standard Brownian motion, $W_{0}=0$ almost surely. The equation simplifies to\n$$\nW_{t}^{2} = 2\\int_{0}^{t} W_{s}\\,dW_{s} + t.\n$$\nWe can rearrange this to express the process $W_{t}^{2}$ in the form of a Doob-Meyer decomposition:\n$$\nW_{t}^{2} - t = 2\\int_{0}^{t} W_{s}\\,dW_{s}.\n$$\nThe right-hand side, being an Itô integral with respect to a Brownian motion, is a continuous local martingale. Let's denote it by $L_{t} = 2\\int_{0}^{t} W_{s}\\,dW_{s}$. So, we have shown that $W_{t}^{2} - t$ is a local martingale.\n\nNow we use the definitions provided in the problem statement.\nFirst, for the predictable quadratic variation $\\langle W \\rangle_{t}$: The problem defines $\\langle W \\rangle_{t}$ as the unique predictable, increasing process such that $W_{t}^{2} - \\langle W \\rangle_{t}$ is a local martingale. We have found that $W_{t}^{2} - t$ is a local martingale. The process $A_{t} = t$ is a deterministic function of time, which makes it predictable. It is also continuous and strictly increasing. By the uniqueness stipulated in the definition, we can definitively identify $\\langle W \\rangle_{t}$ with $t$.\n$$\n\\langle W \\rangle_{t} = t.\n$$\nSecond, for the quadratic variation $[W]_{t}$: For a continuous local martingale such as $W_{t}$, the quadratic variation $[W]_{t}$ can be uniquely characterized as the continuous process of finite variation, starting at $0$, such that $W_{t}^{2} - [W]_{t}$ is a local martingale. Our result from Itô's formula, $W_{t}^{2} - t = L_{t}$, shows such a decomposition. The process $A_{t} = t$ is continuous, starts at $A_{0}=0$, and has finite variation on any interval $[0, T]$ (its total variation is $T$). Therefore, by this uniqueness property (which connects the pathwise limit definition to the martingale decomposition property), we can also identify $[W]_{t}$ with $t$.\n$$\n[W]_{t} = t.\n$$\nThis is consistent with the initial Itô rule $d[W]_{t} = dt$ we used. The argument shows how Itô's formula leads to a decomposition that allows the identification of both variation processes via their defining martingale properties.\n\n### Task 2: Cross-Variation of Correlated Brownian Motions\n\nWe are asked to compute the cross-variation $[W^{1}, W^{2}]_{t}$ for a $2$-dimensional Brownian motion where $W^{1}$ and $B$ are independent standard Brownian motions and $W^{2}_{t} = \\rho\\, W^{1}_{t} + \\sqrt{1-\\rho^{2}}\\; B_{t}$.\n\nA foundational property of the quadratic covariation operator $[\\cdot, \\cdot]_{t}$ is its bilinearity. For continuous local martingales $X$, $Y$, $Z$ and real constants $a, b$, we have:\n$$\n[aX+bY, Z]_{t} = a[X, Z]_{t} + b[Y, Z]_{t}.\n$$\nApplying this property to $[W^{1}, W^{2}]_{t}$, we substitute the expression for $W^{2}_{t}$:\n$$\n[W^{1}, W^{2}]_{t} = \\left[W^{1}, \\rho W^{1} + \\sqrt{1-\\rho^{2}} B\\right]_{t}.\n$$\nUsing bilinearity, we can expand this expression:\n$$\n[W^{1}, W^{2}]_{t} = \\left[W^{1}, \\rho W^{1}\\right]_{t} + \\left[W^{1}, \\sqrt{1-\\rho^{2}} B\\right]_{t}.\n$$\nThe constants can be factored out of the covariation:\n$$\n[W^{1}, W^{2}]_{t} = \\rho [W^{1}, W^{1}]_{t} + \\sqrt{1-\\rho^{2}} [W^{1}, B]_{t}.\n$$\nThe cross-variation of a process with itself is its quadratic variation, $[X,X]_{t} = [X]_{t}$. Therefore, $[W^{1}, W^{1}]_{t} = [W^{1}]_{t}$. Since $W^{1}$ is a standard Brownian motion, we know from Task $1$ that $[W^{1}]_{t} = t$.\n\nThe second term involves $[W^{1}, B]_{t}$. A fundamental result in stochastic calculus is that the quadratic covariation of two independent continuous local martingales is zero. Since $W^{1}$ and $B$ are given to be independent standard Brownian motions, they are independent continuous local martingales, and thus:\n$$\n[W^{1}, B]_{t} = 0.\n$$\nSubstituting these results back into our expression for $[W^{1}, W^{2}]_{t}$:\n$$\n[W^{1}, W^{2}]_{t} = \\rho (t) + \\sqrt{1-\\rho^{2}} (0).\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final result:\n$$\n[W^{1}, W^{2}]_{t} = \\rho t.\n$$\n\n### Final Answer Assembly\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be a row vector listing the three quantities in the order $[W]_{t}$, $\\langle W \\rangle_{t}$, and $[W^{1},W^{2}]_{t}$. Based on our derivations:\n- $[W]_{t} = t$\n- $\\langle W \\rangle_{t} = t$\n- $[W^{1},W^{2}]_{t} = \\rho t$\n\nThe resulting row vector is $(t, t, \\rho t)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nt & t & \\rho t\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2972096"}, {"introduction": "Having mastered the basics for Brownian motion, we now generalize to the vast class of continuous martingales represented by stochastic integrals.

The process $\\langle M \\rangle$ is defined by the Doob–Meyer decomposition (DMD) of the submartingale $M_{t}^{2}$. Specifically, $M_{t}^{2}$ can be uniquely decomposed as the sum of a continuous local martingale and a continuous, non-decreasing, predictable process of finite variation starting at zero. This latter process is $\\langle M \\rangle_{t}$. Our strategy will be to find this decomposition explicitly.\n\nFirst, we apply Itô's product rule for continuous semimartingales, which states that for two such processes $X$ and $Y$, the differential of their product is $d(X_t Y_t) = X_t dY_t + Y_t dX_t + d\\langle X, Y \\rangle_t$. Let's apply this with $X_{t} = Y_{t} = M_{t}$.\nThe process $M_t$ is a continuous semimartingale (in fact, a continuous local martingale). Applying the rule gives:\n$$\nd(M_{t}^{2}) = M_{t} dM_{t} + M_{t} dM_{t} + d\\langle M, M \\rangle_{t} = 2M_{t} dM_{t} + d\\langle M \\rangle_{t}\n$$\nIntegrating this from $t=0$ to a generic time $t \\geq 0$, we get:\n$$\nM_{t}^{2} - M_{0}^{2} = \\int_{0}^{t} 2M_{s}\\,dM_{s} + \\int_{0}^{t} d\\langle M \\rangle_{s}\n$$\nFrom the definition of $M_t$, we have $M_{0} = \\int_{0}^{0} H_s\\,dB_s = 0$. By definition, the quadratic variation process starts at zero, so $\\langle M \\rangle_{0} = 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\nM_{t}^{2} = 2\\int_{0}^{t} M_{s}\\,dM_{s} + \\langle M \\rangle_{t}\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_{0}^{t} M_{s}\\,dM_{s}$ is a stochastic integral with respect to the continuous local martingale $M_s$. The integrand $M_s$ is an adapted process. Therefore, the process $N_{t}^{(1)} := 2\\int_{0}^{t} M_{s}\\,dM_{s}$ is a continuous local martingale. The process $A_{t}^{(1)} := \\langle M \\rangle_{t}$ is, by definition, a continuous, non-decreasing, and predictable process of finite variation starting at $0$. Thus, the equation $M_{t}^{2} = N_{t}^{(1)} + A_{t}^{(1)}$ provides one such decomposition for the submartingale $M_{t}^{2}$.\n\nNext, we establish a second decomposition for $M_{t}^{2}$ using the properties of Brownian motion. Let us define a process $A_{t}^{(2)} := \\int_{0}^{t} H_{s}^{2}\\,ds$.\nSince $H_s$ is a predictable process, $H_s^2$ is also a predictable process. The integral of a non-negative predictable process with respect to Lebesgue measure yields a continuous, non-decreasing, and predictable process. Since $H_s^2 \\ge 0$, $A_{t}^{(2)}$ is non-decreasing. The condition $\\mathbb{E}[\\int_{0}^{T} H_s^2 ds] < \\infty$ implies that $\\int_{0}^{T} H_s^2 ds < \\infty$ almost surely, ensuring $A_t^{(2)}$ is continuous for $t \\in [0, T]$. Finally, as an integral of a predictable process, $A_t^{(2)}$ is itself predictable. Thus, $A_{t}^{(2)}$ is a valid candidate for the predictable part in a Doob-Meyer decomposition.\n\nNow, consider the process $N_{t}^{(2)} := M_{t}^{2} - A_{t}^{(2)} = M_{t}^{2} - \\int_{0}^{t} H_{s}^{2}\\,ds$. We will show that $N_{t}^{(2)}$ is a continuous martingale. It is continuous because both $M_t^2$ and $A_t^{(2)}$ are continuous. To show it is a martingale, we need to show that for any $0 \\leq s < t$, $\\mathbb{E}[N_{t}^{(2)} - N_{s}^{(2)} | \\mathcal{F}_{s}] = 0$.\nThis is equivalent to showing $\\mathbb{E}[M_{t}^{2} - M_{s}^{2} | \\mathcal{F}_{s}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\int_{s}^{t} H_{u}^{2}\\,du | \\mathcal{F}_{s}]$.\nWe have $M_{t} - M_{s} = \\int_{s}^{t} H_{u}\\,dB_{u}$. Since $M_s$ is $\\mathcal{F}_s$-measurable and $\\mathbb{E}[M_t - M_s | \\mathcal{F}_s] = 0$ (martingale property of $M_t$), we calculate:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[M_{t}^{2} - M_{s}^{2} | \\mathcal{F}_{s}] = \\mathbb{E}[(M_{t} - M_{s} + M_{s})^{2} - M_{s}^{2} | \\mathcal{F}_{s}] = \\mathbb{E}[(M_{t} - M_{s})^{2} + 2M_s(M_t - M_s) + M_s^2 - M_s^2 | \\mathcal{F}_{s}]\n$$\n$$\n= \\mathbb{E}[(M_{t} - M_{s})^{2} | \\mathcal{F}_{s}] + 2M_{s}\\mathbb{E}[M_{t} - M_{s} | \\mathcal{F}_{s}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\int_{s}^{t} H_{u}\\,dB_{u}\\right)^{2} \\Big| \\mathcal{F}_{s}\\right]\n$$\nThis identity is known as the conditional Itô isometry. We demonstrate it for simple predictable processes first.

As $t\\uparrow T$, the term $T-t \\to 0^{+}$, so $\\frac{T}{T-t} \\to \\infty$, and consequently\n$$\n\\lim_{t\\uparrow T}\\langle M\\rangle_{t} = \\lim_{t\\uparrow T} \\ln\\left(\\frac{T}{T-t}\\right) = \\infty.\n$$\nThis shows that Novikov's condition fails for the entire interval $[0,T]$, suggesting that $\\left(\\mathcal{E}_{t}\\right)_{t\\in[0,T]}$ is a strict local martingale (i.e., not a true martingale).\n\nTo find the terminal value $\\mathcal{E}_{T} = \\lim_{t\\uparrow T}\\mathcal{E}_{t}$, we analyze the limit of $\\mathcal{E}_{t}=\\exp\\!\\left(M_{t}-\\frac{1}{2}\\langle M\\rangle_{t}\\right)$. By the Dambis–Dubins–Schwartz theorem, we can express $M_t$ as a time-changed Brownian motion. Let $\\tau(t) = \\langle M\\rangle_{t} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{T}{T-t}\\right)$. There exists a standard Brownian motion $B$ such that $M_t = B_{\\tau(t)}$. As $t \\uparrow T$, $\\tau(t) \\to \\infty$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\mathcal{E}_t$ gives\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_t = \\exp\\!\\left(B_{\\tau(t)} - \\frac{1}{2}\\tau(t)\\right).\n$$\nThe limit $\\mathcal{E}_T$ is then\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_{T} = \\lim_{t\\uparrow T} \\exp\\!\\left(B_{\\tau(t)} - \\frac{1}{2}\\tau(t)\\right) = \\lim_{s\\to\\infty} \\exp\\!\\left(B_{s} - \\frac{1}{2}s\\right).\n$$\nBy the strong law of large numbers for Brownian motion (or the law of the iterated logarithm), $\\lim_{s\\to\\infty} \\frac{B_s}{s} = 0$ almost surely. This implies that for large $s$, the linear term $-\\frac{1}{2}s$ dominates the Brownian term $B_s$. The exponent $B_s - \\frac{1}{2}s$ tends to $-\\infty$ almost surely as $s\\to\\infty$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_{T} = \\exp(-\\infty) = 0 \\quad \\text{almost surely}.\n$$\nThe expectation of this terminal value is thus\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\mathcal{E}_{T}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}[0] = 0.\n$$\n\n(c) A non-negative local martingale is a supermartingale. Thus, $\\left(\\mathcal{E}_{t}\\right)_{t\\in[0,T]}$ is a supermartingale. By the Doob–Meyer decomposition theorem, it can be uniquely written as $\\mathcal{E}_{t}=N_{t}-A_{t}$ for $t\\in[0,T]$, where $N$ is a uniformly integrable martingale and $A$ is a non-decreasing, predictable process with $A_0=0$.\nSince $N$ is a martingale on $[0,T]$, we have $\\mathbb{E}[N_T] = N_0$. At $t=0$, we have $\\mathcal{E}_0 = N_0 - A_0$. Since $\\mathcal{E}_0=1$ and $A_0=0$, it follows that $N_0=1$, and so $\\mathbb{E}[N_T]=1$.\nTaking expectations in the decomposition at the terminal time $T$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\mathcal{E}_T] = \\mathbb{E}[N_T] - \\mathbb{E}[A_T].\n$$\nSubstituting the values we have found: $0 = 1 - \\mathbb{E}[A_T]$, which gives $\\mathbb{E}[A_T]=1$.\nThe existence of a non-zero compensator $A$ is directly tied to the failure of the martingale property. If $\\mathcal{E}$ were a true, uniformly integrable martingale on $[0,T]$, its Doob–Meyer decomposition would be trivial, i.e., $A_t=0$ for all $t$, and we would have $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathcal{E}_T] = \\mathcal{E}_0 = 1$. Our finding that $\\mathbb{E}[A_T]=1$ shows that $A$ is non-trivial. This non-triviality signals that $\\mathcal{E}$ is a strict local martingale and not uniformly integrable. The \"mass\" of the expectation, $\\lim_{t\\uparrow T}\\mathbb{E}[\\mathcal{E}_t] = 1$, is not preserved at the limit, $\\mathbb{E}[\\lim_{t\\uparrow T}\\mathcal{E}_t] = 0$. The difference, $1-0=1$, is precisely the expected value of the compensator at time $T$, $\\mathbb{E}[A_T]$.\n\n(d) For the change of measure defined by the density $Z = \\frac{d\\mathbb{Q}}{d\\mathbb{P}}=\\mathcal{E}_{T}$ to define a new probability measure $\\mathbb{Q}$, the density $Z$ must satisfy $Z \\geq 0$ almost surely and $\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P}}[Z]=1$.\nThe first condition, $\\mathcal{E}_T \\ge 0$, holds as shown previously.\nThe second condition, $\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P}}[\\mathcal{E}_T]=1$, fails, as we computed $\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P}}[\\mathcal{E}_T]=0$.\nSince the total mass $\\mathbb{Q}(\\Omega) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P}}[\\mathcal{E}_T]=0$, $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the zero measure, not a probability measure.\nConsequently, $\\mathbb{Q}$ cannot be equivalent to $\\mathbb{P}$. Two measures are equivalent if they have the same sets of measure zero. Here, $\\mathbb{P}(\\Omega)=1 > 0$, while $\\mathbb{Q}(\\Omega)=0$. Thus, $\\Omega$ is not a null set under $\\mathbb{P}$ but is a null set under $\\mathbb{Q}$. The measures are not equivalent; they are mutually singular. This failure is a direct consequence of $\\mathcal{E}$ not being a uniformly integrable martingale up to time $T$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2985330"}]}
