The concepts used—Brownian motion, martingales, stochastic integrals, quadratic variation, stopping times, and time-change—are all fundamental and well-defined in the theory of stochastic processes.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing each part of the task in sequence.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Quadratic Variation $\\langle M \\rangle_t$**\n\nThe process $(M_t)_{t \\geq 0}$ is defined as an Itô integral of the form $M_t = \\int_0^t \\sigma(s) \\, dW_s$, where the integrand is the deterministic process $\\sigma(s) = \\sqrt{1+s}$. For any such Itô integral where the integrand $\\sigma$ is a predictable process satisfying $\\int_0^t \\mathbb{E}[\\sigma(s)^2] \\, ds < \\infty$ (which is true here as $\\sigma$ is deterministic), the quadratic variation process $\\langle M \\rangle_t$ is given by the Itô isometry property:\n$$\n\\langle M \\rangle_t = \\int_{0}^{t} \\sigma(s)^2 \\, ds\n$$\nSubstituting $\\sigma(s) = \\sqrt{1+s}$, we get:\n$$\n\\langle M \\rangle_t = \\int_{0}^{t} \\left(\\sqrt{1+s}\\right)^2 \\, ds = \\int_{0}^{t} (1+s) \\, ds\n$$\nEvaluating this elementary integral yields:\n$$\n\\langle M \\rangle_t = \\left[s + \\frac{s^2}{2}\\right]_{0}^{t} = \\left(t + \\frac{t^2}{2}\\right) - \\left(0 + \\frac{0^2}{2}\\right) = t + \\frac{t^2}{2}\n$$\nThe quadratic variation of $M_t$ is a deterministic, strictly increasing, and continuous function of $t$ for $t \\geq 0$.\n\n**2. Construction of the Time-Change $\\tau(u)$**\n\nWe want to find a time-change function $t = \\tau(u)$ such that the new process $B_u := M_{\\tau(u)}$ has a quadratic variation equal to $u$, i.e., $\\langle B \\rangle_u = u$. The quadratic variation of a time-changed continuous martingale is given by $\\langle M_{\\tau} \\rangle_u = \\langle M \\rangle_{\\tau(u)}$.\nTherefore, we must find the function $\\tau(u)$ that satisfies the equation:\n$$\n\\langle M \\rangle_{\\tau(u)} = u\n$$\nUsing our result for $\\langle M \\rangle_t$, we set $t = \\tau(u)$:\n$$\n\\tau(u) + \\frac{(\\tau(u))^2}{2} = u\n$$\nTo find $\\tau(u)$, we solve this quadratic equation for $\\tau(u)$. Let $x = \\tau(u)$, the equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}x^2 + x - u = 0 \\implies x^2 + 2x - 2u = 0\n$$\nUsing the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=1$, $b=2$, and $c=-2u$:\n$$\n\\tau(u) = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2 - 4(1)(-2u)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 8u}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{1 + 2u}}{2} = -1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 2u}\n$$\nSince time must be non-negative, $\\tau(u) \\geq 0$ for all $u \\geq 0$. The solution $\\tau(u) = -1 - \\sqrt{1+2u}$ is always negative. Therefore, we must choose the positive root:\n$$\n\\tau(u) = -1 + \\sqrt{1 + 2u}\n$$\nThis function satisfies $\\tau(0) = -1 + \\sqrt{1} = 0$, and for $u > 0$, $\\tau(u) > 0$. It is also continuous and strictly increasing for $u \\geq 0$, as its derivative is $\\frac{d\\tau}{du} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+2u}} > 0$.\n\n**3. Properties of $\\tau(u)$ and $(B_u)$**\n\nFirst, we prove that for each fixed $u \\geq 0$, $\\tau(u)$ is an $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \\geq 0}$-stopping time. The time-change $\\tau(u)$ is defined as the first passage time $\\tau(u) = \\inf\\{s \\geq 0 : \\langle M \\rangle_s \\geq u\\}$. Since $\\langle M \\rangle_s = s + s^2/2$ is a continuous, strictly increasing, and $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$-adapted process (in fact, it is deterministic), the first passage time $\\tau(u)$ is a stopping time.\nMore simply, for any fixed $u \\geq 0$, $\\tau(u) = -1 + \\sqrt{1+2u}$ is a deterministic constant. Let this constant be $T_u$. For any $t \\geq 0$, the set $\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega: \\tau(u)(\\omega) \\leq t\\}$ is $\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega: T_u \\leq t\\}$. This set is $\\Omega$ if $T_u \\leq t$ and $\\emptyset$ if $T_u > t$. Since $\\Omega$ and $\\emptyset$ are in every $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_t$, the condition $\\{\\tau(u) \\leq t\\} \\in \\mathcal{F}_t$ is satisfied for all $t\\geq 0$. Thus, $\\tau(u)$ is a stopping time.\n\nNext, we show that $(B_u)_{u \\geq 0}$ is adapted to the filtration $\\mathcal{G}_u := \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau(u)}$. We need to show that for each $u \\geq 0$, the random variable $B_u$ is $\\mathcal{G}_u$-measurable. By definition, $B_u = M_{\\tau(u)}$. The process $(M_t)$ is adapted to $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$. A standard result states that if $(X_t)$ is an adapted process and $T$ is a stopping time, the stopped random variable $X_T$ is $\\mathcal{F}_T$-measurable. Since $M_t$ is $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$-adapted and $\\tau(u)$ is an $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$-stopping time, $M_{\\tau(u)}$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau(u)}$-measurable. This is precisely the condition that $B_u$ is $\\mathcal{G}_u$-measurable.\n\n**4. Justification that $(B_u)$ is a Standard Brownian Motion**\n\nWe verify the defining properties of a standard $(\\mathcal{G}_u)$-Brownian motion for the process $B_u = M_{\\tau(u)}$.\ni. **$B_0=0$ a.s.:** $B_0 = M_{\\tau(0)}$. We found $\\tau(0) = 0$. So, $B_0 = M_0 = \\int_0^0 \\sqrt{1+s} \\, dW_s = 0$.\n\nii. **Continuous paths:** $B_u(\\omega) = M_{\\tau(u)}(\\omega)$. The process $M_t$ is a continuous martingale, so its paths $t \\mapsto M_t(\\omega)$ are continuous. The time-change $u \\mapsto \\tau(u)$ is a continuous function. The composition of continuous functions is continuous, so the paths $u \\mapsto B_u(\\omega)$ are continuous.\n\niii. **Martingale property and correct quadratic variation:** By Lévy's characterization of Brownian motion, a continuous local martingale starting at $0$ is a standard Brownian motion with respect to its filtration if and only if its quadratic variation is $\\langle B \\rangle_u = u$.\nWe know that $(M_t)_{t\\geq 0}$ is a martingale. By the Optional Stopping Theorem, since $\\tau(s)$ and $\\tau(u)$ are stopping times with $\\tau(s) \\leq \\tau(u)$ for $s \\leq u$, the time-changed process $(B_u)_{u \\geq 0}=(M_{\\tau(u)})_{u \\geq 0}$ is a martingale with respect to the filtration $(\\mathcal{G}_u)$. Specifically, for $s  u$, $\\mathbb{E}[B_u | \\mathcal{G}_s] = \\mathbb{E}[M_{\\tau(u)} | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau(s)}] = M_{\\tau(s)} = B_s$.\n\nThe quadratic variation of $B_u$ is $\\langle B \\rangle_u = \\langle M \\rangle_{\\tau(u)}$. By our construction of $\\tau(u)$, we have $\\langle M \\rangle_{\\tau(u)} = u$. Therefore, $\\langle B \\rangle_u = u$.\nSince $B_u$ is a continuous $(\\mathcal{G}_u)$-martingale, starts at $0$, and has quadratic variation $\\langle B \\rangle_u = u$, by Lévy's characterization, $(B_u)_{u \\geq 0}$ is a standard Brownian motion with respect to the filtration $(\\mathcal{G}_u)_{u \\geq 0}$.\n\nThe problem ultimately asks for the explicit closed-form expression for the time-change function $u \\mapsto \\tau(u)$, which we have derived.\n\nFinal expression: $\\tau(u) = -1 + \\sqrt{1+2u}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-1 + \\sqrt{1+2u}}\n$$", "id": "2998416"}, {"introduction": "Girsanov's theorem provides a powerful toolkit for changing the law of a stochastic process, effectively allowing us to switch between different statistical \"realities\".

The theorem requires the construction of a Radon-Nikodym density process.\n\nLet $\\theta_t^{(a)} = a$ for all $t \\in [0, T]$. This process $\\theta^{(a)}$ is deterministic and represents the new drift we wish to introduce. We define the process $Z_t^{(a)}$ as the Doléans–Dade exponential of the stochastic integral of $\\theta^{(a)}$ with respect to $W$:\n$$\nZ_t^{(a)} = \\mathcal{E}\\left(\\int_0^\\cdot \\theta_s^{(a)} dW_s\\right)_t = \\mathcal{E}\\left(\\int_0^\\cdot a \\, dW_s\\right)_t\n$$\nThe explicit formula for the Doléans–Dade exponential of a continuous local martingale $M_t$ is $\\mathcal{E}(M)_t = \\exp(M_t - \\frac{1}{2}\\langle M \\rangle_t)$. In our case, $M_t = \\int_0^t a \\, dW_s = aW_t$, and its quadratic variation is $\\langle M \\rangle_t = \\int_0^t a^2 \\, d\\langle W \\rangle_s = \\int_0^t a^2 \\, ds = a^2t$.\nThus, the density process is:\n$$\nZ_t^{(a)} = \\exp\\left(aW_t - \\frac{1}{2}a^2t\\right)\n$$\nFor $Z_t^{(a)}$ to define a valid change of probability measure on $\\mathcal{F}_T$, it must be a true martingale on $[0, T]$, not just a local martingale. This requires $\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P}}[Z_T^{(a)}] = Z_0^{(a)} = 1$. A sufficient condition for this is Novikov's condition, which states that if $\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P}}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^T (\\theta_s^{(a)})^2 ds\\right)\\right]  \\infty$, then $Z_t^{(a)}$ is a uniformly integrable martingale.\nLet us verify this condition:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P}}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^T a^2 \\, ds\\right)\\right] = \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P}}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}a^2T\\right)\\right]\n$$\nSince $a$ and $T$ are finite constants, the term $\\exp(\\frac{1}{2}a^2T)$ is a positive finite constant. The expectation of a constant is the constant itself, so the condition is satisfied.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P}}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}a^2T\\right)\\right] = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}a^2T\\right)  \\infty\n$$\nTherefore, $Z_t^{(a)}$ is a martingale on $[0, T]$. We can now define the probability measure $\\mathbb{Q}^{(a)}$ on $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}_T)$ via its Radon-Nikodym derivative with respect to $\\mathbb{P}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbb{Q}^{(a)}}{d\\mathbb{P}}\\bigg|_{\\mathcal{F}_T} = Z_T^{(a)} = \\exp\\left(aW_T - \\frac{1}{2}a^2T\\right)\n$$\nSince $Z_T^{(a)}$ is strictly positive almost surely, the measure $\\mathbb{Q}^{(a)}$ is equivalent to $\\mathbb{P}$ on $\\mathcal{F}_T$ (i.e., $\\mathbb{Q}^{(a)} \\sim \\mathbb{P}$).\n\nBy the Girsanov theorem, the process $B_t^{(a)}$ defined by\n$$\nB_t^{(a)} = W_t - \\int_0^t \\theta_s^{(a)} ds = W_t - at\n$$\nis a standard Brownian motion under the measure $\\mathbb{Q}^{(a)}$.\nFrom this definition, we can express the dynamics of $W_t$ as $W_t = at + B_t^{(a)}$. In differential form, this is:\n$$\ndW_t = a \\, dt + dB_t^{(a)}\n$$\nThis shows that under $\\mathbb{Q}^{(a)}$, the process $W$ is a time-homogeneous Itō diffusion with constant drift $a$ and constant diffusion coefficient $1$, as required.\n\nThe exact same construction and reasoning apply to the constant $b$. We define $\\theta_t^{(b)} = b$, which leads to the density process:\n$$\nZ_t^{(b)} = \\exp\\left(bW_t - \\frac{1}{2}b^2t\\right)\n$$\nNovikov's condition is again satisfied as $\\exp(\\frac{1}{2}b^2T)  \\infty$.

For any $s, t \\in [0,1]$, the increment $Y_{s,t} = X_t - X_s$ is a linear combination of Gaussian random variables, and thus is itself a Gaussian random variable. Since $X_t$ is centered for all $t$, we have $\\mathbb{E}[Y_{s,t}] = \\mathbb{E}[X_t] - \\mathbb{E}[X_s] = 0 - 0 = 0$. So, $Y_{s,t}$ is a centered Gaussian random variable.\n\nThe variance of this increment is $\\operatorname{Var}(Y_{s,t}) = \\operatorname{Var}(X_t - X_s)$. The problem provides the bound:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(X_t - X_s) \\leq \\sigma^2 |t-s|^{2H}.\n$$\nWe want to find a moment bound of the form specified in the Kolmogorov theorem. We use the moment characterization for the centered Gaussian variable $Y_{s,t} = X_t - X_s$. For any $p > 0$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\big[|X_t - X_s|^p\\big] = M_p \\left(\\operatorname{Var}(X_t - X_s)\\right)^{p/2}.\n$$\nSubstituting the given variance bound, we obtain:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\big[|X_t - X_s|^p\\big] \\leq M_p \\left( \\sigma^2 |t-s|^{2H} \\right)^{p/2} = M_p \\sigma^p |t-s|^{Hp}.\n$$\nThe problem asks us to find suitable exponents $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ for a fixed moment order $q > \\frac{1}{H}$. We choose our moment order $p$ to be this given $q$. Let $p=q$. The moment inequality becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\big[|X_t - X_s|^q\\big] \\leq (M_q \\sigma^q) |t-s|^{Hq}.\n$$\nNow, we must match this to the form required by the Kolmogorov continuity theorem, $\\mathbb{E}[|X_t - X_s|^{\\alpha}] \\leq C|t-s|^{1+\\beta}$.\nBy comparing the two expressions, we can identify the parameters:\n1.  The moment exponent is $\\alpha = q$.\n2.  The constant is $C = M_q \\sigma^q$.\n3.  The exponent of the time difference term must match: $Hq = 1 + \\beta$.\n\nFrom $Hq = 1 + \\beta$, we can solve for $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\beta = Hq - 1.\n$$\nFor the Kolmogorov theorem to apply, we need $\\alpha > 0$ and $\\beta > 0$. Since $q > 1/H$ and $H>0$, we have $q>0$, so $\\alpha>0$. The condition $q > 1/H$ is equivalent to $Hq > 1$, which implies $\\beta = Hq - 1 > 0$. Thus, the conditions of the theorem are met with these choices of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n\nThe suitable exponents are $\\alpha = q$ and $\\beta = Hq-1$.\n\n**Step 4: Determination of the Supremum Hölder Index**\n\nHaving established the moment bound $\\mathbb{E}[|X_t - X_s|^q] \\leq C |t-s|^{1+(Hq-1)}$ with $\\alpha=q$ and $\\beta=Hq-1$, we can apply the conclusion of the Kolmogorov continuity theorem.\nThe theorem guarantees the existence of a modification of $\\{X_t\\}$ with almost surely $\\gamma$-Hölder continuous sample paths for any $\\gamma  \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}$.\nThe supremum Hölder index $\\gamma^{\\star}$ guaranteed by the theorem is therefore:\n$$\n\\gamma^{\\star} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}.\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ we found:\n$$\n\\gamma^{\\star} = \\frac{Hq - 1}{q} = H - \\frac{1}{q}.\n$$\nThe condition $q > 1/H$ ensures that $\\gamma^{\\star} = H - 1/q > 0$. Since $H \\in (0,1)$, we have $\\gamma^{\\star}  H  1$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Result**\n\nThe problem asks for the row vector $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma^{\\star})$ as functions of $H$ and $q$. Based on our derivation:\n-   $\\alpha = q$\n-   $\\beta = Hq - 1$\n-   $\\gamma^{\\star} = H - \\frac{1}{q}$\n\nThe resulting row vector is $(q, Hq-1, H-\\frac{1}{q})$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nq  Hq - 1  H - \\frac{1}{q}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2998396"}]}
