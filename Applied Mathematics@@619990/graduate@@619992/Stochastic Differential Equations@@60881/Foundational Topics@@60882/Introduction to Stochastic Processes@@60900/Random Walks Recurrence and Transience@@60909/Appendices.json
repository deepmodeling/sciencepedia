Transience and Asymptotic Behavior**\n\nTo determine the long-term behavior of $X_t$, we can analyze the ratio $X_t/t$ as $t \\to \\infty$:\n$$\n\\frac{X_t}{t} = \\mu + \\frac{W_t}{t}\n$$\nThe Strong Law of Large Numbers for a standard Wiener process states that $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} W_t/t = 0$ almost surely (a.s.).

The stochastic term dominates the drift term for times sufficiently close to zero.\n\nMore formally, the LIL implies that for any $\\delta > 0$, the process $W_t$ (and thus $X_t = \\mu t + W_t$) will take on both positive and negative values within the interval $(0, \\delta)$. The sample paths of $X_t$ are continuous because they are the sum of two continuous functions ($f(t)=\\mu t$ and $W_t$). By the Intermediate Value Theorem, a continuous function that takes both positive and negative values in an interval must cross zero within that interval.\n\nThis means that for almost every sample path, there is a return to zero within any interval $(0, \\delta)$, no matter how small $\\delta$ is.
