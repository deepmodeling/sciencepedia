We are given that $\\{B_{t}\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ is a martingale.\n\nThe Optional Sampling Theorem states that for a martingale $\\{M_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ and a stopping time $\\sigma$, under certain conditions, $\\mathbb{E}[M_{\\sigma}] = \\mathbb{E}[M_0]$. A primary condition for the theorem is that the stopping time $\\sigma$ is bounded. However, the first exit time $\\tau$ is not, in general, a bounded random variable. Therefore, we cannot apply the theorem directly to $\\tau$.\n\nAs stipulated by the problem, we employ a truncation argument. We define a sequence of stopping times $\\{\\tau_n\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ by truncating $\\tau$ at a deterministic time $n$:\n$$\n\\tau_n \\equiv \\tau \\wedge n = \\min(\\tau, n)\n$$\nFor any fixed $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the stopping time $\\tau_n$ is bounded, since $0 \\le \\tau_n \\le n$. We can therefore apply the Optional Sampling Theorem for bounded stopping times to the martingale $\\{B_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ and the stopping time $\\tau_n$. This yields:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[B_{\\tau_n}] = \\mathbb{E}[B_0]\n$$\nGiven the initial condition $B_0 = x$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[B_{\\tau_n}] = x \\quad \\text{for all } n \\in \\mathbb{N}\n$$\nOur goal is to determine $\\mathbb{E}[B_{\\tau}]$ by taking the limit as $n \\to \\infty$. To do this, we need to justify the interchange of the limit and expectation operators. We will use the Lebesgue Dominated Convergence Theorem. This theorem requires two conditions to be met for the sequence of random variables $\\{B_{\\tau_n}\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$:\n1.  Almost sure convergence of the sequence to a limit random variable.\n2.  Domination of the sequence by an integrable random variable.\n\nFirst, we verify the almost sure convergence. For a one-dimensional Brownian motion, the probability of it ever exiting a finite interval is $1$. Thus, the stopping time $\\tau$ is almost surely finite, i.e., $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau < \\infty) = 1$. This implies that as $n \\to \\infty$, the sequence of truncated times $\\tau_n = \\tau \\wedge n$ converges to $\\tau$ almost surely. Since the sample paths of a Brownian motion are continuous almost surely, the sequence of random variables $B_{\\tau_n}$ converges to $B_\\tau$ almost surely:\n$$\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} B_{\\tau_n} = B_{\\tau} \\quad \\text{(a.s.)}\n$$\nSecond, we must find an integrable random variable that dominates the sequence $\\{|B_{\\tau_n}|\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$. Let us examine the value of $B_{\\tau_n}$ for any given sample path $\\omega \\in \\Omega$.\nThe time is $\\tau_n(\\omega) = \\min(\\tau(\\omega), n)$.\n- If $\\tau(\\omega) \\le n$, then $\\tau_n(\\omega) = \\tau(\\omega)$. By the definition of $\\tau$ and the continuity of the paths, $B_{\\tau(\\omega)}(\\omega)$ must equal either $a$ or $b$. Hence, $B_{\\tau_n}(\\omega) \\in \\{a, b\\}$.\n- If $\\tau(\\omega) > n$, then $\\tau_n(\\omega) = n$. Since $n < \\tau(\\omega)$, the process has not yet exited the interval $(a,b)$ at time $n$. Therefore, $B_n(\\omega) \\in (a,b)$, which means $B_{\\tau_n}(\\omega) \\in (a,b)$.\n\nIn both cases, for any sample path $\\omega$ and any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the value of $B_{\\tau_n}(\\omega)$ lies within the closed interval $[a,b]$. This implies that the random variable $B_{\\tau_n}$ is uniformly bounded in magnitude:\n$$\n|B_{\\tau_n}| \\le \\max(|a|, |b|)\n$$\nLet $C = \\max(|a|, |b|)$. This is a finite constant. The constant random variable $Y \\equiv C$ is integrable, since its expectation is $\\mathbb{E}[Y] = C < \\infty$. As $|B_{\\tau_n}| \\le Y$ for all $n$, the sequence $\\{B_{\\tau_n}\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is dominated by an integrable random variable.\n\nWith both conditions of the Dominated Convergence Theorem satisfied, we are justified in interchanging the limit and the expectation:\n$$\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\mathbb{E}[B_{\\tau_n}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} B_{\\tau_n}\\right]\n$$\nSubstituting our previous findings into this equality:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[B_{\\tau}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} B_{\\tau_n}\\right] = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\mathbb{E}[B_{\\tau_n}]\n$$\nSince we established that $\\mathbb{E}[B_{\\tau_n}] = x$ for all $n$, the limit is straightforward:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[B_{\\tau}] = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} x = x\n$$\nThus, the expected value of the Brownian motion at the first exit time from the interval $(a,b)$ is simply its starting value, $x$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{x}$$", "id": "2998513"}, {"introduction": "Moving from continuous processes to jump processes, this practice explores the structure of submartingales, using the Poisson process as a key example.

It is a standard exercise in stochastic calculus that is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.

Use the decomposition to express $\\mathbb{E}[X_{\\tau}]$.\n3.  Apply the Optional Sampling Theorem to the martingale component.\n4.  Calculate the expectation of the predictable component at time $\\tau$.\n5.  Combine the results to obtain the final expression.\n\nThe process $X_t = N_t$ is a càdlàg submartingale with respect to its natural filtration. The Doob-Meyer decomposition theorem guarantees its unique decomposition into a sum of a martingale and a predictable, increasing process:\n$$\nX_t = M_t + A_t\n$$\nwhere $M$ is a martingale and $A$ is a predictable, non-decreasing, integrable process with $A_0=0$. For a standard Poisson process $N_t$ with rate $\\lambda > 0$, the process $M_t = N_t - \\lambda t$ is a martingale. This can be verified by checking the martingale property for $s<t$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[M_t | \\mathcal{F}_s] = \\mathbb{E}[N_t - \\lambda t | \\mathcal{F}_s] = \\mathbb{E}[N_t - N_s + N_s - \\lambda t | \\mathcal{F}_s]\n$$\nSince $N_s$ is $\\mathcal{F}_s$-measurable and the increment $N_t - N_s$ is independent of $\\mathcal{F}_s$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[M_t | \\mathcal{F}_s] = \\mathbb{E}[N_t - N_s] + N_s - \\lambda t = \\lambda(t-s) + N_s - \\lambda t = N_s - \\lambda s = M_s\n$$\nThus, the canonical decomposition of $X_t = N_t$ is:\n$$\nN_t = (N_t - \\lambda t) + \\lambda t\n$$\nHere, the martingale is $M_t = N_t - \\lambda t$ and the predictable increasing process, known as the compensator, is $A_t = \\lambda t$. The role of predictability is crucial for the uniqueness of this decomposition. A process is predictable if it is measurable with respect to the predictable $\\sigma$-algebra, which is generated by all left-continuous adapted processes. The process $A_t = \\lambda t$ is deterministic and its sample paths are continuous functions of time. Any continuous adapted process is predictable, so $A_t$ satisfies this condition.\n\nWe want to calculate $\\mathbb{E}[X_{\\tau}] = \\mathbb{E}[N_{\\tau}]$. Using the decomposition at the stopping time $\\tau$:\n$$\nN_{\\tau} = M_{\\tau} + A_{\\tau}\n$$\nBy the linearity of expectation, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[N_{\\tau}] = \\mathbb{E}[M_{\\tau}] + \\mathbb{E}[A_{\\tau}]\n$$\nWe evaluate each term separately.\n\nFor the martingale term $\\mathbb{E}[M_{\\tau}]$, we apply the Optional Sampling Theorem (OST). The stopping time is $\\tau = \\inf\\{t \\geq 0: N_t \\geq 1\\} \\wedge T$. Since $T$ is a positive constant, we have $0 \\le \\tau(\\omega) \\le T$ for all $\\omega \\in \\Omega$. Therefore, $\\tau$ is a bounded stopping time. The version of the OST for bounded stopping times states that if $M_t$ is a right-continuous martingale and $\\tau$ is a bounded stopping time, then $\\mathbb{E}[M_{\\tau}] = \\mathbb{E}[M_0]$. The process $M_t=N_t-\\lambda t$ is right-continuous because $N_t$ is a càdlàg process and the function $t \\mapsto \\lambda t$ is continuous. The conditions are met, so we can apply the theorem.\nThe value of the martingale at time $t=0$ is:\n$$\nM_0 = N_0 - \\lambda \\cdot 0\n$$\nFor a standard Poisson process, $N_0=0$. Thus, $M_0 = 0$.\nApplying the OST, we get:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[M_{\\tau}] = \\mathbb{E}[M_0] = 0\n$$\n\nNext, we evaluate the term $\\mathbb{E}[A_{\\tau}]$. The compensator is $A_t = \\lambda t$. At the stopping time $\\tau$, this becomes $A_{\\tau} = \\lambda \\tau$. We need to compute its expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[A_{\\tau}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\lambda \\tau] = \\lambda \\mathbb{E}[\\tau]\n$$\nTo find $\\mathbb{E}[\\tau]$, we analyze the stopping time $\\tau = T_1 \\wedge T$, where $T_1 = \\inf\\{t \\geq 0 : N_t \\geq 1\\}$ is the time of the first arrival of the Poisson process. The random variable $T_1$ follows an exponential distribution with rate $\\lambda$, so $T_1 \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda)$. The survival function of $T_1$ is $\\mathbb{P}(T_1 > t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$ for $t \\ge 0$.\n\nFor any non-negative random variable $Y$, its expectation can be computed as $\\mathbb{E}[Y] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{P}(Y > t) dt$. Applying this to $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\tau] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{P}(\\tau > t) dt\n$$\nThe event $\\{\\tau > t\\}$ is equivalent to $\\{T_1 \\wedge T > t\\}$. We consider two cases for $t$:\n1.  If $t \\ge T$, then $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau > t) = 0$ because $\\tau \\le T$.\n2.  If $0 \\le t < T$, the condition $T_1 \\wedge T > t$ is equivalent to $T_1 > t$ (since $T > t$ is already true). Thus, for $0 \\le t < T$, $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau > t) = \\mathbb{P}(T_1 > t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$.\n\nNow, we can compute the integral for $\\mathbb{E}[\\tau]$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\tau] = \\int_0^T \\mathbb{P}(\\tau > t) dt + \\int_T^\\infty \\mathbb{P}(\\tau > t) dt = \\int_0^T \\exp(-\\lambda t) dt + 0\n$$\nEvaluating the integral:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\tau] = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\exp(-\\lambda t) \\right]_0^T = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} (\\exp(-\\lambda T) - \\exp(-\\lambda \\cdot 0)) = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} (\\exp(-\\lambda T) - 1) = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda T)}{\\lambda}\n$$\nNow we can find $\\mathbb{E}[A_{\\tau}]$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[A_{\\tau}] = \\lambda \\mathbb{E}[\\tau] = \\lambda \\left( \\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda T)}{\\lambda} \\right) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda T)\n$$\n\nFinally, we combine the two parts to find $\\mathbb{E}[X_{\\tau}]$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_{\\tau}] = \\mathbb{E}[N_{\\tau}] = \\mathbb{E}[M_{\\tau}] + \\mathbb{E}[A_{\\tau}] = 0 + (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda T))\n$$\nTherefore, the expected value is $1 - \\exp(-\\lambda T)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda T)}$$", "id": "2998510"}, {"introduction": "The theoretical framework of stochastic processes often relies on the \"usual conditions\" of completeness and right-continuity for the filtration.
