{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Our exploration into the hands-on aspects of filtrations begins with a foundational concept. This first practice examines the relationship between a stochastic process and the information it generates over time, known as its natural filtration. By considering a Galton-Watson branching process, we will solidify the very definition of an adapted process and clarify the common point of confusion between knowing the present state (adaptedness) and being able to forecast it from the past (predictability) [@problem_id:1302376].", "problem": "In the study of population dynamics, a simple model for the evolution of a population is the Galton-Watson process. Let the size of a population at generation $n$ be denoted by the random variable $Z_n$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$. We begin with a single ancestor, so $Z_0=1$.\n\nFor any generation $n \\ge 1$, the population size $Z_n$ is determined by the total number of offspring from the $Z_{n-1}$ individuals in the previous generation. We assume that each individual in generation $n-1$ independently gives birth to a random number of offspring. These numbers of offspring are independent and identically distributed non-negative integer-valued random variables.\n\nThe natural filtration for this process is the sequence of sigma-algebras $\\{\\mathcal{F}_n\\}_{n \\ge 0}$ where $\\mathcal{F}_n = \\sigma(Z_0, Z_1, \\dots, Z_n)$. This filtration represents the history of the population size up to and including generation $n$. A stochastic process $\\{X_n\\}_{n \\ge 0}$ is said to be adapted to a filtration $\\{\\mathcal{G}_n\\}_{n \\ge 0}$ if the random variable $X_n$ is measurable with respect to the sigma-algebra $\\mathcal{G}_n$ for every $n \\ge 0$.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly assesses whether the Galton-Watson process $\\{Z_n\\}_{n \\ge 0}$ is adapted to its natural filtration $\\{\\mathcal{F}_n\\}_{n \\ge 0}$?\n\nA. The process is adapted. By the definition of the natural filtration, $\\mathcal{F}_n$ contains all information about the values of $Z_0, \\dots, Z_n$. Therefore, for any $n$, the value of $Z_n$ is known given the information in $\\mathcal{F}_n$, which makes it $\\mathcal{F}_n$-measurable.\n\nB. The process is not adapted. To be adapted, the value of $Z_n$ must be known at time $n-1$. However, $Z_n$ depends on the random number of offspring from the $(n-1)$-th generation, which are not known at time $n-1$.\n\nC. The process is adapted only if the population does not die out. If $Z_k=0$ for some generation $k$, then $Z_n=0$ for all $n>k$. In this deterministic state, the process is adapted. However, if the population is always positive, the future is uncertain, and thus the process is not adapted.\n\nD. The process is not adapted. The filtration $\\mathcal{F}_n = \\sigma(Z_0, \\dots, Z_n)$ only contains information about the total population sizes. It does not contain information about the individual offspring counts that constitute $Z_n$, and without this more detailed information, $Z_n$ cannot be determined, so it is not $\\mathcal{F}_n$-measurable.", "solution": "The problem asks whether the Galton-Watson process $\\{Z_n\\}_{n \\ge 0}$ is adapted to its natural filtration $\\{\\mathcal{F}_n\\}_{n \\ge 0}$.\n\nFirst, let's recall the key definitions.\n1.  **Stochastic Process:** A sequence of random variables $\\{Z_n\\}_{n \\ge 0}$ defined on a common probability space.\n2.  **Filtration:** A sequence of increasing sigma-algebras $\\{\\mathcal{F}_n\\}_{n \\ge 0}$ such that $\\mathcal{F}_0 \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}_1 \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}_2 \\subseteq \\dots$. A sigma-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_n$ represents the collection of events whose occurrence is known by time $n$.\n3.  **Natural Filtration:** The natural filtration generated by a process $\\{Z_n\\}_{n \\ge 0}$ is defined as $\\mathcal{F}_n = \\sigma(Z_0, Z_1, \\dots, Z_n)$ for each $n \\ge 0$. This is the smallest sigma-algebra with respect to which the random variables $Z_0, Z_1, \\dots, Z_n$ are all measurable. It represents all the information contained in the history of the process up to time $n$.\n4.  **Adapted Process:** A process $\\{Z_n\\}_{n \\ge 0}$ is adapted to a filtration $\\{\\mathcal{G}_n\\}_{n \\ge 0}$ if, for every $n \\ge 0$, the random variable $Z_n$ is $\\mathcal{G}_n$-measurable.\n\nThe question is whether $Z_n$ is $\\mathcal{F}_n$-measurable for all $n \\ge 0$, where $\\mathcal{F}_n = \\sigma(Z_0, Z_1, \\dots, Z_n)$.\n\nBy the very definition of the sigma-algebra generated by a set of random variables, $\\mathcal{F}_n = \\sigma(Z_0, Z_1, \\dots, Z_n)$ is constructed to be the smallest sigma-algebra that makes each of the random variables $Z_0, Z_1, \\dots, Z_n$ measurable with respect to it.\nTherefore, it is a direct and fundamental consequence of the definition that $Z_n$ is $\\mathcal{F}_n$-measurable for every $n$.\n\nThis holds true for *any* stochastic process with respect to its own natural filtration. The fact that $\\{Z_n\\}$ is a Galton-Watson process is incidental to this particular question; the property is definitional. Intuitively, \"adapted\" means that the value of the process at time $n$ is known if you have the information available at time $n$. Since the natural filtration *is* the information of the process history up to time $n$, the value of $Z_n$ is, by definition, known.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\nA. This statement is correct. It precisely captures the definitional relationship between a random variable and the sigma-algebra it helps generate. The random variable $Z_n$ is, by construction, measurable with respect to $\\mathcal{F}_n = \\sigma(Z_0, \\dots, Z_n)$.\n\nB. This statement is incorrect. It confuses the concept of being \"adapted\" with being \"predictable\". A process is predictable if $Z_n$ is measurable with respect to the \"strictly past\" information, $\\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$. The definition of adaptedness requires measurability with respect to the \"present\" information, $\\mathcal{F}_n$. While $Z_n$ is generally not known at time $n-1$, its value is revealed at time $n$, making it $\\mathcal{F}_n$-measurable.\n\nC. This statement is incorrect. The adaptedness of a process to its natural filtration is a structural property that does not depend on the specific outcomes or future trajectory of the process, such as whether it goes extinct or not. The uncertainty of the future does not affect the measurability of the present state with respect to the present information set.\n\nD. This statement is incorrect. It misunderstands what it means for a random variable to be measurable with respect to a sigma-algebra. We do not need the most granular information (like individual offspring counts) for $Z_n$ to be $\\mathcal{F}_n$-measurable. $\\mathcal{F}_n$-measurability simply means that for any set of values $A$ (a Borel set), the event $\\{Z_n \\in A\\}$ is in the sigma-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_n$. Since $\\mathcal{F}_n$ is generated by $Z_n$ (among others), this condition holds by definition. The information \"the total population size at time $n$ is $k$\" is precisely the information contained within $\\mathcal{F}_n$.\n\nTherefore, the only correct statement is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1302376"}, {"introduction": "Having established the baseline definition of adaptedness, we now probe deeper into the concept of information content.

For $n \\ge 1$, the filtration $\\mathcal{F}_n$ is generated by the first $n$ steps $(X_1, \\dots, X_n)$. The sample space for these $n$ steps has $2^n$ equally likely outcomes (paths), and the atoms of $\\mathcal{F}_n$ are precisely these individual paths.\n\nFirst, we establish the general relationship between $\\mathcal{F}_n$ and $\\mathcal{G}_n$. For any $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, the random variable $S_k = \\sum_{i=1}^k X_i$ is a function of $(X_1, \\dots, X_k)$ and is therefore $\\mathcal{F}_k$-measurable.

The function $\\text{sgn}(x)$ is a Borel-measurable function, so $\\text{sgn}(S_k)$ is also $\\mathcal{F}_n$-measurable. Since this holds for all $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, the sigma-algebra generated by these random variables, $\\mathcal{G}_n = \\sigma(\\text{sgn}(S_1), \\dots, \\text{sgn}(S_n))$, must be a sub-sigma-algebra of $\\mathcal{F}_n$.

This is equivalent to showing that the generators of $\\mathcal{F}_2$, namely $X_1$ and $X_2$, are $\\mathcal{G}_2$-measurable.\nLet's consider the information available in $\\mathcal{G}_2$, which is the vector $(\\text{sgn}(S_1), \\text{sgn}(S_2))$.\nNote that $S_1 = X_1$. Since $X_1$ can only be $1$ or $-1$, $S_1$ is never zero. Therefore, $\\text{sgn}(S_1) = S_1 = X_1$. This means $X_1$ is $\\sigma(\\text{sgn}(S_1))$-measurable, and since $\\sigma(\\text{sgn}(S_1)) \\subseteq \\mathcal{G}_2$, $X_1$ is $\\mathcal{G}_2$-measurable.\n\nNow let's examine the possible outcomes for $(X_1, X_2)$ and the corresponding values of $(\\text{sgn}(S_1), \\text{sgn}(S_2))$:\n1.  Path $(X_1, X_2) = (1, 1)$: $S_1=1, S_2=2$. Sign vector: $(\\text{sgn}(1), \\text{sgn}(2)) = (1, 1)$.\n2.  Path $(X_1, X_2) = (1, -1)$: $S_1=1, S_2=0$. Sign vector: $(\\text{sgn}(1), \\text{sgn}(0)) = (1, 0)$.\n3.  Path $(X_1, X_2) = (-1, 1)$: $S_1=-1, S_2=0$. Sign vector: $(\\text{sgn}(-1), \\text{sgn}(0)) = (-1, 0)$.\n4.  Path $(X_1, X_2) = (-1, -1)$: $S_1=-1, S_2=-2$. Sign vector: $(\\text{sgn}(-1), \\text{sgn}(-2)) = (-1, -1)$.\n\nEach of the four possible paths for $(X_1, X_2)$ produces a unique sign vector $(\\text{sgn}(S_1), \\text{sgn}(S_2))$. This means that observing the sign vector is equivalent to knowing the exact path. For instance, if we observe the sign vector $(1, 0)$, we know with certainty that the path was $(1, -1)$, so $X_1=1$ and $X_2=-1$.\nSince $(X_1, X_2)$ can be determined from $(\\text{sgn}(S_1), \\text{sgn}(S_2))$, both $X_1$ and $X_2$ are $\\mathcal{G}_2$-measurable.

Let's consider $n=3$.\nThe atoms of $\\mathcal{F}_3$ are the $2^3=8$ individual paths of length 3. The atoms of $\\mathcal{G}_3$ are sets of paths that produce the same sign sequence $(\\text{sgn}(S_1), \\text{sgn}(S_2), \\text{sgn}(S_3))$. If we can find two distinct paths that generate the same sign sequence, then $\\mathcal{F}_3$ is strictly finer than $\\mathcal{G}_3$, and they are not equal.\n\nConsider the following two paths for $(X_1, X_2, X_3)$:\n1.  Path $\\omega_1 = (1, 1, -1)$: $S_1=1, S_2=2, S_3=1$. The sign sequence is $(\\text{sgn}(1), \\text{sgn}(2), \\text{sgn}(1)) = (1, 1, 1)$.\n2.  Path $\\omega_2 = (1, 1, 1)$: $S_1=1, S_2=2, S_3=3$. The sign sequence is $(\\text{sgn}(1), \\text{sgn}(2), \\text{sgn}(3)) = (1, 1, 1)$.\n\nPaths $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ are distinct, so $\\{\\omega_1\\}$ and $\\{\\omega_2\\}$ are distinct atoms in $\\mathcal{F}_3$. However, they both belong to the same event $A = \\{\\omega: (\\text{sgn}(S_1), \\text{sgn}(S_2), \\text{sgn}(S_3))=(1,1,1)\\}$, which is an atom of $\\mathcal{G}_3$. Since the atom $A$ of $\\mathcal{G}_3$ is a non-trivial union of atoms from $\\mathcal{F}_3$, the sigma-algebras are not identical.

A random variable is measurable with respect to a sigma-algebra if and only if it is constant on every atom of that sigma-algebra.\nLet's use our findings from the analysis of statement II for $n=3$. We identified the atom $A = \\{\\omega_1, \\omega_2, \\dots \\}$ of $\\mathcal{G}_3$, where $\\omega_1 = (1, 1, -1)$ and $\\omega_2 = (1, 1, 1)$.\nLet's evaluate the random variable $S_3$ on these two outcomes, which both lie in the same atom of $\\mathcal{G}_3$:\n-   $S_3(\\omega_1) = 1+1-1 = 1$.\n-   $S_3(\\omega_2) = 1+1+1 = 3$.\nSince $S_3$ takes on different values on the atom $A$, it cannot be $\\mathcal{G}_3$-measurable.\nBecause the condition fails for $n=3$, the process $(S_n)$ is not adapted to the filtration $(\\mathcal{G}_n)$.\n**Statement III is FALSE.**\n\n**Statement IV: The process $(M_n)_{n \\geq 1}$ defined by $M_n = S_n^2 - n$ is a martingale with respect to the observer's filtration $(\\mathcal{G}_n)_{n \\geq 1}$.**\n\nFor a process to be a martingale with respect to a filtration, it must first be adapted to that filtration. That is, $M_n$ must be $\\mathcal{G}_n$-measurable for every $n \\ge 1$.\nLet's check this adaptedness condition for $n=3$. We use the same atom $A$ of $\\mathcal{G}_3$ and the outcomes $\\omega_1, \\omega_2$ as before.\nWe evaluate the random variable $M_3 = S_3^2 - 3$:\n-   $M_3(\\omega_1) = S_3(\\omega_1)^2 - 3 = 1^2 - 3 = -2$.\n-   $M_3(\\omega_2) = S_3(\\omega_2)^2 - 3 = 3^2 - 3 = 6$.\nSince $M_3$ is not constant on the atom $A$ of $\\mathcal{G}_3$, $M_3$ is not $\\mathcal{G}_3$-measurable.\nTherefore, the process $(M_n)$ is not adapted to the filtration $(\\mathcal{G}_n)$, and it cannot be a martingale with respect to $(\\mathcal{G}_n)$.\n**Statement IV is FALSE.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Statement I is TRUE.\n- Statement II is FALSE.\n- Statement III is FALSE.\n- Statement IV is FALSE.\n\nThe only true statement is I.

This means the filtration is right-continuous and complete. The first jump time is $T_{1}=\\inf\\{t0:\\Delta N_{t}=1\\}$. This is a stopping time with respect to $(\\mathcal{F}_{t})$.\n\n**Adaptedness:**\nA process $X=(X_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ is adapted to the filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ if for every $t \\ge 0$, the random variable $X_t$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable.\nFor the process $H_t = \\mathbf{1}_{\\{t=T_1\\}}$, we need to show that $H_t$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable for all $t \\ge 0$.\nThe random variable $H_t$ can only take values $0$ or $1$. It is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable if and only if the event $\\{H_t=1\\}$ belongs to $\\mathcal{F}_t$.\nThe event $\\{H_t=1\\}$ is precisely the event $\\{T_1=t\\}$.\nBy definition, a random time $T$ is a stopping time if the event $\\{T \\le t\\} \\in \\mathcal{F}_t$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\nFor a right-continuous filtration, which we have by the \"usual conditions\", if $T$ is a stopping time, then the event $\\{T=t\\}$ is also in $\\mathcal{F}_t$ for all $t \\ge 0$. This can be seen by writing $\\{T=t\\} = \\{T \\le t\\} \\setminus \\{T  t\\}$. While $\\{T \\le t\\} \\in \\mathcal{F}_t$ by definition, the right-continuity of the filtration ensures that $\\{T  t\\} \\in \\mathcal{F}_t$ as well.\nSpecifically, $\\{T  t\\} = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty \\{T \\le t - 1/n\\}$ for rational $t-1/n  t$. Each set $\\{T \\le t-1/n\\}$ is in $\\mathcal{F}_{t-1/n}$, and thus in $\\mathcal{F}_t$. A countable union of sets in $\\mathcal{F}_t$ is also in $\\mathcal{F}_t$.\nTherefore, $\\{T_1=t\\} \\in \\mathcal{F}_t$ for all $t \\ge 0$. This implies $H_t$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable for all $t \\ge 0$. Thus, the process $H$ is adapted.\n\n**Optionality:**\nA process is optional if it is measurable with respect to the optional $\\sigma$-field $\\mathcal{O}$ on $\\mathbb{R}_+ \\times \\Omega$. The optional $\\sigma$-field is the $\\sigma$-field generated by all càdlàg (right-continuous with left limits) adapted processes.\nA fundamental result in the theory of stochastic processes is that for any stopping time $T$, its graph, defined as the set $[[T]] = \\{(t, \\omega) \\in \\mathbb{R}_+ \\times \\Omega : t = T(\\omega)\\}$, is an optional set (i.e., $[[T]] \\in \\mathcal{O}$).\nThe process $H_t = \\mathbf{1}_{\\{t=T_1\\}}$ is the indicator function of the graph of the stopping time $T_1$. That is, $H_t(\\omega) = \\mathbf{1}_{[[T_1]]}(t, \\omega)$. As the indicator function of an optional set, $H$ is an optional process.\n\n**Non-predictability:**\nA process is predictable if it is measurable with respect to the predictable $\\sigma$-field $\\mathcal{P}$ on $\\mathbb{R}_+ \\times \\Omega$. The predictable $\\sigma$-field is generated by all left-continuous adapted processes. A key characterization is that a process $X$ is predictable if and only if $X_t$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{t-}$-measurable for all $t  0$ (and $X_0$ is $\\mathcal{F}_0$-measurable), where $\\mathcal{F}_{t-} = \\sigma(\\bigcup_{st} \\mathcal{F}_s)$.\nLet's test this for $H_t$. We examine the event $\\{H_t=1\\} = \\{T_1=t\\}$ for some $t  0$. This event occurs if and only if there are no jumps before time $t$ and a jump occurs exactly at time $t$. This can be written in terms of the Poisson process $N$ as $\\{N_{t-} = 0\\} \\cap \\{N_t = 1\\}$.\nThe information available in the filtration $\\mathcal{F}_{t-}$ is the history of the process strictly before time $t$. So, the event $\\{N_{t-} = 0\\} = \\bigcap_{st} \\{N_s=0\\}$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{t-}$-measurable.\nHowever, the event $\\{N_t=1\\}$ depends on the behavior of the process at time $t$. This information is not contained in $\\mathcal{F}_{t-}$. Given $\\mathcal{F}_{t-}$, and specifically on the set where $\\{N_{t-}=0\\}$, the process has a certain probability of jumping at time $t$, but it is not determined. Thus, $\\{N_t=1\\}$ is not an $\\mathcal{F}_{t-}$-measurable event.\nSince $\\{H_t=1\\}$ is not in $\\mathcal{F}_{t-}$, the process $H$ is not predictable.\nThis aligns with the classification of stopping times. A stopping time $T$ is predictable if it is \"announced\" by a sequence of stopping times $T_n \\uparrow T$ with $T_n  T$. The first jump time of a Poisson process is a classic example of a totally inaccessible stopping time, which is by definition not predictable. A process of the form $\\mathbf{1}_{\\{t=T\\}}$ is predictable if and only if $T$ is a predictable stopping time. Since $T_1$ is not predictable, $H$ is not predictable.\n\n### Part 2: Computation of the Integral\n\nWe are asked to compute $I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} H_{t} \\, dM_{t}$. The process $M_t$ is given by $M_t = N_t - t$. By the linearity of the stochastic integral, we can write:\n$$ I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} H_{t} \\, d(N_{t} - t) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} H_{t} \\, dN_{t} - \\int_{0}^{\\infty} H_{t} \\, dt $$\nThe problem specifies that the integral with respect to the finite-variation part should be interpreted as a pathwise Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral. Both $N_t$ and the deterministic process $A_t=t$ are processes of finite variation on any finite time interval. Thus, both integrals on the right-hand side can be computed for each path $\\omega$ as Lebesgue-Stieltjes integrals.\n\nLet's compute the second term first:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} H_{t} \\, dt $$\nFor a fixed sample path $\\omega$, the first jump time $T_1(\\omega)$ is a specific, positive real number. The function $t \\mapsto H_t(\\omega)$ is defined as $H_t(\\omega) = \\mathbf{1}_{\\{t=T_1(\\omega)\\}}$. This function is zero for all $t \\neq T_1(\\omega)$ and is $1$ only at the single point $t=T_1(\\omega)$. The Lebesgue integral of a function that is non-zero only on a set of measure zero (a single point in this case) is zero. Thus, for every $\\omega$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} H_{t}(\\omega) \\, dt = 0 $$\n\nNow, let's compute the first term:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} H_{t} \\, dN_{t} $$\nThis is a Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral with respect to the sample path of a Poisson process. For a fixed path $\\omega$, $N_t(\\omega)$ is a right-continuous, non-decreasing step function. It starts at $N_0=0$ and its value increases by $1$ at each jump time $T_1(\\omega), T_2(\\omega), \\dots$. The measure $dN_t$ corresponds to a sum of Dirac delta masses of size $1$ located at each jump time. The integral is therefore given by the sum over the jumps:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} H_{t}(\\omega) \\, dN_{t}(\\omega) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} H_{T_k(\\omega)}(\\omega) \\, \\Delta N_{T_k(\\omega)} $$\nwhere $T_k(\\omega)$ is the time of the $k$-th jump and $\\Delta N_{T_k(\\omega)} = N_{T_k(\\omega)}(\\omega) - N_{T_k-}(\\omega)$ is the size of the jump. For a standard Poisson process, all jumps are of size $1$, so $\\Delta N_{T_k(\\omega)} = 1$ for all $k \\ge 1$. The integral becomes:\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} H_{T_k(\\omega)}(\\omega) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\mathbf{1}_{\\{T_k(\\omega)=T_1(\\omega)\\}} $$\nThe jump times of a Poisson process are almost surely distinct, $0  T_1(\\omega)  T_2(\\omega)  T_3(\\omega)  \\dots$. Therefore, the condition $T_k(\\omega) = T_1(\\omega)$ is only satisfied for $k=1$. The sum reduces to a single non-zero term:\n$$ \\mathbf{1}_{\\{T_1(\\omega)=T_1(\\omega)\\}} + \\mathbf{1}_{\\{T_2(\\omega)=T_1(\\omega)\\}} + \\mathbf{1}_{\\{T_3(\\omega)=T_1(\\omega)\\}} + \\dots = 1 + 0 + 0 + \\dots = 1 $$\nThis holds for any path $\\omega$ where $T_1$ is finite, which occurs with probability $1$.\n\nCombining the two results, we find the value of the integral $I$:\n$$ I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} H_{t} \\, dN_{t} - \\int_{0}^{\\infty} H_{t} \\, dt = 1 - 0 = 1 $$\nThe fact that $H_t$ is optional but not predictable is crucial for the theory of such integrals. The integral of an optional process with respect to a martingale with jumps (like $M_t$) is well-defined, and its value is determined by the behavior of the integrand at the jump times of the martingale. Our pathwise calculation is consistent with the general theory of stochastic integration for semimartingales.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2976620"}]}
