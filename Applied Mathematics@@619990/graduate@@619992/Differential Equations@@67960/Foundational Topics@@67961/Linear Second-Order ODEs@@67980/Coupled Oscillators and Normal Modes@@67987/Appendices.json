We solve the quadratic equation $Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0$, where $A=m_1m_2$, $B=-(k_1+k_2)(m_1+m_2)$, and $C=4k_1k_2$. The two roots, which we will denote $\\omega_-^2(\\pi/a)$ and $\\omega_+^2(\\pi/a)$, are:\n$$\\omega_{\\pm}^2(\\pi/a) = \\frac{-(B) \\pm \\sqrt{B^2-4AC}}{2A}$$\nThe band gap width $\\Delta\\omega$ is then computed as:\n$$\\Delta\\omega = \\sqrt{\\omega_+^2(\\pi/a)} - \\sqrt{\\omega_-^2(\\pi/a)}$$\nThis calculation is independent of the lattice constant $a$, which only serves to define the range of the wave number $q$. The program will implement the solution of this final quadratic equation for each parameter set provided.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the phononic band gap width for a 1D diatomic chain.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each tuple contains (m1, m2, k1, k2, a) in SI units.\n    test_cases = [\n        (1.0, 2.5, 100.0, 100.0, 1.0),  # Test 1\n        (1.0, 1.0, 100.0, 100.0, 1.0),  # Test 2\n        (1.0, 1.0, 60.0, 140.0, 1.0),   # Test 3\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        m1, m2, k1, k2, a = case\n\n        # The band gap is determined by the frequencies at the edge of the\n        # first Brillouin zone, where q = pi/a.\n        # At this point, the dispersion relation simplifies to a quadratic\n        # equation for omega^2:\n        # A*(omega^2)^2 + B*(omega^2) + C = 0\n        \n        # Coefficients of the quadratic equation\n        A = m1 * m2\n        B = -(k1 + k2) * (m1 + m2)\n        C = 4 * k1 * k2\n\n        # The discriminant must be non-negative for real frequency solutions.\n        # It can be shown that for physical masses and spring constants,\n        # discriminant >= 0 is always true.\n        discriminant = B**2 - 4 * A * C\n\n        # If A is zero (e.g., one mass is zero), the model is pathological.\n        # However, problem constraints imply m1, m2 > 0.\n        if A == 0:\n            # This case should not be reached with valid inputs.\n            # It would represent a different physical system.\n            results.append(0.0)\n            continue\n            \n        # Solve for the two roots of omega^2 using the quadratic formula.\n        # omega_sq_minus corresponds to the top of the acoustic band.\n        # omega_sq_plus corresponds to the bottom of the optical band.\n        omega_sq_minus = (-B - np.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * A)\n        omega_sq_plus = (-B + np.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * A)\n        \n        # Frequencies are the square root of these solutions.\n        # Roots for omega^2 are guaranteed to be non-negative for k1, k2 > 0.\n        omega_minus = np.sqrt(omega_sq_minus)\n        omega_plus = np.sqrt(omega_sq_plus)\n        \n        # The band gap width is the difference between the minimum frequency of the\n        # optical band and the maximum frequency of the acoustic band.\n        band_gap_width = omega_plus - omega_minus\n        \n        results.append(band_gap_width)\n\n    # Format the results as a comma-separated list of strings,\n    # with each float rounded to exactly six decimal places.\n    results_str = [f\"{r:.6f}\" for r in results]\n    \n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results_str)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2418641"}]}
