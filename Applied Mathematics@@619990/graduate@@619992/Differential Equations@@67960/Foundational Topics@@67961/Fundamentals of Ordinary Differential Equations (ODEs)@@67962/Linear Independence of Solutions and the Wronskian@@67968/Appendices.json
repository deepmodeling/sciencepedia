The Wronskian of two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ is given by the determinant:\n$$\nW(f, g)(x) = \\begin{vmatrix} f(x) & g(x) \\\\ f'(x) & g'(x) \\end{vmatrix} = f(x)g'(x) - f'(x)g(x)\n$$\nWe have $f(x) = x^2$, so its derivative is $f'(x) = 2x$.\nThe function $g(x) = x|x|$ is a piecewise function. We can write it as:\n$$\ng(x) = \\begin{cases} x(x) = x^2 & \\text{if } x \\ge 0 \\\\ x(-x) = -x^2 & \\text{if } x < 0 \\end{cases}\n$$\nNow, we find the derivative of $g(x)$. For $x > 0$, $g'(x) = 2x$. For $x < 0$, $g'(x) = -2x$. At $x=0$, we use the definition of the derivative:\n$$\ng'(0) = \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{g(0+h) - g(0)}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{h|h| - 0}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0} |h| = 0\n$$\nSince the limit exists, $g(x)$ is differentiable at $x=0$, and $g'(0) = 0$. So, the derivative of $g(x)$ can be written as:\n$$\ng'(x) = \\begin{cases} 2x & \\text{if } x \\ge 0 \\\\ -2x & \\text{if } x < 0 \\end{cases}\n$$\nThis is equivalent to $g'(x) = 2|x|$.\n\nNow we can compute the Wronskian by considering the cases for $x$.\nCase 1: $x \\ge 0$.\nIn this case, $f(x) = x^2$, $f'(x) = 2x$, $g(x) = x^2$, and $g'(x) = 2x$.\n$$\nW(x) = f(x)g'(x) - f'(x)g(x) = (x^2)(2x) - (2x)(x^2) = 2x^3 - 2x^3 = 0\n$$\nCase 2: $x < 0$.\nIn this case, $f(x) = x^2$, $f'(x) = 2x$, $g(x) = -x^2$, and $g'(x) = -2x$.\n$$\nW(x) = f(x)g'(x) - f'(x)g(x) = (x^2)(-2x) - (2x)(-x^2) = -2x^3 + 2x^3 = 0\n$$\nSince the Wronskian is 0 for $x \\ge 0$ and for $x < 0$, we conclude that $W(f, g)(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$.\n\nNext, we check for linear independence on the interval $I = (-\\infty, \\infty)$. The functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are linearly independent on $I$ if the equation $c_1 f(x) + c_2 g(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in I$ implies that the constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ must both be zero.\nLet's set up the equation:\n$$\nc_1 x^2 + c_2 x|x| = 0, \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)\n$$\nTo solve for $c_1$ and $c_2$, we can evaluate this equation at specific points in the interval.\nLet's choose $x=1$ (a point where $x>0$):\n$$\nc_1(1)^2 + c_2(1)|1| = 0 \\implies c_1 + c_2 = 0\n$$\nNow let's choose $x=-1$ (a point where $x<0$):\n$$\nc_1(-1)^2 + c_2(-1)|-1| = 0 \\implies c_1(1) + c_2(-1)(1) = 0 \\implies c_1 - c_2 = 0\n$$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n1. $c_1 + c_2 = 0$\n2. $c_1 - c_2 = 0$\nFrom equation (2), we get $c_1 = c_2$. Substituting this into equation (1) gives $c_1 + c_1 = 0$, which means $2c_1 = 0$, so $c_1 = 0$. Since $c_1 = c_2$, we also have $c_2 = 0$.\nSince the only solution is the trivial solution $c_1 = 0$ and $c_2 = 0$, the functions $f(x) = x^2$ and $g(x) = x|x|$ are linearly independent on the interval $(-\\infty, \\infty)$.\n\nIn summary, we have found that the Wronskian $W(f, g)(x)$ is identically zero on $(-\\infty, \\infty)$, and the functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are linearly independent on $(-\\infty, \\infty)$. This situation does not contradict the theorem relating the Wronskian to linear independence for solutions of a linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation, because that theorem requires the coefficients of the differential equation to be continuous on the interval. The functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ can be shown to be solutions of an ODE like $x y'' - 2y' = 0$, whose coefficient is discontinuous at $x=0$.\n\nLet's review the options:\nA. Incorrect.
