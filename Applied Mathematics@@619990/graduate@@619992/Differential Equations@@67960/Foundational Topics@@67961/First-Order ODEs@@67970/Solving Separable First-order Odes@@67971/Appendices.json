Due to the interaction of the fluid with the orifice mechanism, the speed of the fluid exiting the orifice, $v$, is not described by the standard Torricelli's law. Instead, it is found to be related to the instantaneous height $y$ of the fluid surface by the relation $v = \\beta y^{3/4}$, where $\\beta$ is a known positive constant with appropriate units.\n\nAssuming the fluid level in the tank changes slowly enough that the exit velocity relation holds at all times, derive an expression for the time $T$ required for the fluid level to drop from its initial height $H$ to a height of $H/2$.", "solution": "1.
