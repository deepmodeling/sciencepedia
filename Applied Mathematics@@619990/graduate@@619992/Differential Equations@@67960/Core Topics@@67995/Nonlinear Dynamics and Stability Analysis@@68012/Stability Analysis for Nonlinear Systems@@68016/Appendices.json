This exercise focuses on linearization, a core technique where we approximate the nonlinear system with a linear one near an equilibrium.

At the origin, $V(0, 0) = 0$.\nThus, $V(x, y)$ is a positive definite function.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the time derivative of the Lyapunov function**\n\nThe time derivative of $V(x, y)$ along the trajectories of the system is given by:\n$$\n\\dot{V} = \\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} \\frac{dx}{dt} + \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} \\frac{dy}{dt}\n$$\nThe partial derivatives of $V$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} = 2x, \\quad \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} = 2y\n$$\nSubstituting these and the system dynamics into the expression for $\\dot{V}$:\n$$\n\\dot{V} = (2x) \\left( -x + (\\alpha - 1)y \\right) + (2y) \\left( -x - y - y^3 \\right)\n$$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$\n\\dot{V} = -2x^2 + 2(\\alpha - 1)xy - 2xy - 2y^2 - 2y^4\n$$\nCombine the terms containing $xy$:\n$$\n\\dot{V} = -2x^2 + (2\\alpha - 2 - 2)xy - 2y^2 - 2y^4\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{V} = -2x^2 + 2(\\alpha - 2)xy - 2y^2 - 2y^4\n$$\nWe can factor out $-2$ from the quadratic terms:\n$$\n\\dot{V} = -2 \\left( x^2 - (\\alpha - 2)xy + y^2 \\right) - 2y^4\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the conditions on $\\alpha$ for $\\dot{V}$ to be negative definite**\n\nFor the origin to be asymptotically stable, $\\dot{V}$ must be negative definite. This means $\\dot{V}(x,y) < 0$ for all $(x, y) \\neq (0, 0)$.\n\nThe term $-2y^4$ is negative semi-definite (it is zero if $y=0$ and negative otherwise).\nLet's analyze the quadratic part, $Q(x,y) = x^2 - (\\alpha - 2)xy + y^2$. For $\\dot{V}$ to be negative definite, we require the term $-2Q(x,y) - 2y^4$ to be strictly negative for all $(x, y) \\neq (0, 0)$.\n\nA sufficient condition is that $Q(x,y)$ is positive definite. A quadratic form $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2$ is positive definite if and only if $A > 0$ and $4AC - B^2 > 0$.\nFor $Q(x,y)$, we have $A=1$, $C=1$, and $B = -(\\alpha-2)$.\nThe first condition $A > 0$ is satisfied since $1>0$.\nThe second condition is:\n$$\n4(1)(1) - (-(\\alpha-2))^2 > 0\n$$\n$$\n4 - (\\alpha - 2)^2 > 0\n$$\n$$\n(\\alpha - 2)^2 < 4\n$$\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n$$\n|\\alpha - 2| < 2\n$$\nThis inequality can be written as:\n$$\n-2 < \\alpha - 2 < 2\n$$\nAdding 2 to all parts gives:\n$$\n0 < \\alpha < 4\n$$\nFor any $\\alpha$ in this range, $Q(x,y)$ is positive definite, making $-2Q(x,y)$ negative definite. Since $-2y^4$ is negative semi-definite, their sum $\\dot{V}$ is negative definite. Thus, the system is asymptotically stable for $0 < \\alpha < 4$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the boundary case $\\alpha = 4$**\n\nNow we check if stability can be established for the maximum value from the open interval, which is $\\alpha = 4$.\nIf $\\alpha = 4$, the expression for $\\dot{V}$ becomes:\n$$\n\\dot{V} = -2(x^2 - (4 - 2)xy + y^2) - 2y^4\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{V} = -2(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) - 2y^4\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{V} = -2(x - y)^2 - 2y^4\n$$\nWe need to check if $\\dot{V}$ is negative definite. $\\dot{V} \\le 0$ for all $(x,y)$.\n$\\dot{V} = 0$ if and only if $-2(x - y)^2 = 0$ and $-2y^4 = 0$.\nThe second equation implies $y=0$.\nSubstituting $y=0$ into the first equation gives $-2(x-0)^2 = 0$, which implies $x=0$.\nSo, $\\dot{V}(x,y) = 0$ only at the origin $(x,y) = (0,0)$. For any other point, $\\dot{V}(x,y) < 0$.\nTherefore, for $\\alpha=4$, $\\dot{V}$ is negative definite, and the origin is asymptotically stable.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the case $\\alpha > 4$**\n\nIf $\\alpha > 4$, then $(\\alpha-2) > 2$. Let $\\alpha - 2 = 2 + \\epsilon$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$.\nThe quadratic part of $\\dot{V}$ is $-2(x^2 - (2+\\epsilon)xy + y^2)$.\nConsider the values of this term along the line $y=x$:\n$$\n-2(x^2 - (2+\\epsilon)x^2 + x^2) = -2(2x^2 - (2+\\epsilon)x^2) = -2(-\\epsilon x^2) = 2\\epsilon x^2\n$$\nSo, along the line $y=x$, the full expression for $\\dot{V}$ is:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x,x) = 2\\epsilon x^2 - 2x^4 = 2x^2(\\epsilon - x^2)\n$$\nFor any point on the line $y=x$ with $0 < |x| < \\sqrt{\\epsilon}$, we have $\\dot{V}(x,x) > 0$.\nSince there are points arbitrarily close to the origin where $\\dot{V}$ is positive, the origin is unstable for any $\\alpha > 4$. Therefore, stability cannot be established for $\\alpha > 4$ using this Lyapunov function (or any other, as the system is indeed unstable).\n\nCombining our findings, the stability of the origin can be established using the given Lyapunov function for $0 < \\alpha \\le 4$.
