An equilibrium point can be classified, for example, as a saddle point or a center. In a two-dimensional phase space, a saddle point is an unstable equilibrium point which has one direction of attraction and one direction of repulsion. For a conservative system like this one, saddle points correspond to local maxima of the potential energy function $V(x)$.
