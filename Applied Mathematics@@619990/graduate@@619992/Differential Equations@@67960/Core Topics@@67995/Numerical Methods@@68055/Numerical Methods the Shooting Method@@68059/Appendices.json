The system is defined over the domain $x \\in [0, L]$ and is subject to the boundary conditions $y(0) = \\alpha$ and $y(L) = \\beta$. The external forcing function is linear, given by $f(x) = Cx$, where $C$ is a constant.\n\nTo solve this boundary value problem (BVP), one can use the shooting method. This numerical technique involves converting the BVP into an initial value problem (IVP) by selecting a trial value for the initial slope, $s = y'(0)$. The solution of the IVP, denoted as $y(x; s)$, depends on this choice of $s$. The correct slope $s$ is the one for which the solution satisfies the second boundary condition, i.e., $y(L; s) = \\beta$.\n\nFor a linear ODE, this process can be carried out analytically. The solution $y(x; s)$ can be expressed as a linear combination of solutions of two simpler IVPs. Let $u(x)$ be the solution to the IVP:\n$$u'' + k^2 u = Cx, \\quad u(0) = \\alpha, \\quad u'(0) = 0$$\nAnd let $v(x)$ be the solution to the homogeneous IVP:\n$$v'' + k^2 v = 0, \\quad v(0) = 0, \\quad v'(0) = 1$$\nThe solution to the BVP's corresponding IVP with initial slope $s$ is then given by the superposition $y(x; s) = u(x) + s \\cdot v(x)$.\n\nUsing this analytical formulation of the shooting method, derive a closed-form expression for the required initial slope $s = y'(0)$ in terms of the parameters $k, L, C, \\alpha,$ and $\\beta$.

Solving for $u(x)$**\n\nThe IVP for $u(x)$ is:\n$$u'' + k^2 u = Cx, \\quad u(0) = \\alpha, \\quad u'(0) = 0$$\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution $u_h(x)$ and a particular solution $u_p(x)$.\nThe homogeneous equation $u_h'' + k^2 u_h = 0$ has the solution:\n$$u_h(x) = A \\cos(kx) + B \\sin(kx)$$\nFor the particular solution, we use the method of undetermined coefficients. Since the forcing term is $Cx$, we try a solution of the form $u_p(x) = D_1 x + D_0$.\nSubstituting this into the ODE:\n$$u_p''(x) + k^2 u_p(x) = 0 + k^2(D_1 x + D_0) = k^2 D_1 x + k^2 D_0$$\nComparing with the forcing term $Cx$, we have $k^2 D_1 = C$ and $k^2 D_0 = 0$. This gives $D_1 = C/k^2$ and $D_0 = 0$.\nSo, the particular solution is $u_p(x) = \\frac{C}{k^2}x$.\nThe general solution for $u(x)$ is:\n$$u(x) = A \\cos(kx) + B \\sin(kx) + \\frac{C}{k^2}x$$\nNow, we apply the initial conditions for $u(x)$.\n$u(0) = A \\cos(0) + B \\sin(0) + 0 = A$.
