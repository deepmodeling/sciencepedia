However, we will introduce a twist in the form of a weak, non-standard damping force that is proportional to the square of the velocity. This type of damping, known as quadratic damping, appears in situations like high-speed air resistance. This problem provides a perfect entry point into the core idea of multiple-scale analysis by using an intuitive energy-averaging method, which is a powerful proxy for a formal first-order analysis. By averaging the energy dissipation over a single fast oscillation, you will derive the equation governing the slow decay of the amplitude, offering a clear glimpse into how fast and slow dynamics can be separated and analyzed [@problem_id:1124777].", "problem": "An oscillator of mass $m$ is subject to a linear restoring force $-kx$ and a weak quadratic damping force given by $F_{damp} = -c \\dot{x}|\\dot{x}|$, where $c$ is a positive constant.

The damping is assumed to be weak, which means the amplitude of oscillation changes slowly over many periods.\n\nUsing the method of multiple scales, derive the expression for the time-dependent amplitude of the oscillations, $A(t)$. Your result should be valid to the leading order in the small parameter associated with the weak damping.
