The structure of the radial equation is not just a mathematical convenience; it holds the key to understanding fundamental properties of quantum systems. This exercise challenges you to analyze the components of the effective potential, particularly the term dependent on the angular momentum quantum number $l$, to explain a universal feature of atomic and nuclear physics: why the ground state in an attractive central potential is always a state of zero angular momentum ($l=0$) [@problem_id:2118959].", "problem": "A particle of mass $m$ is confined by a spherically symmetric, purely attractive central potential $V(r)$, which satisfies $V(r) \\leq 0$ for all $r \\geq 0$ and $\\lim_{r\\to\\infty} V(r) = 0$. The stationary states of this particle are described by solutions to the time-independent Schrödinger equation.

Which of the following statements provides the correct physical reasoning for why this is the case?\n\nA. A higher value of the quantum number $l$ corresponds to a higher angular kinetic energy, and since the total energy must be conserved, the ground state must correspond to the lowest possible value of $l$, which is $l=0$.\n\nB.

Specifically, $V_{\\text{eff}, l>0}(r) \\geq V_{\\text{eff}, l=0}(r) = V(r)$. A more repulsive (or less attractive) potential always leads to higher energy eigenvalues.
