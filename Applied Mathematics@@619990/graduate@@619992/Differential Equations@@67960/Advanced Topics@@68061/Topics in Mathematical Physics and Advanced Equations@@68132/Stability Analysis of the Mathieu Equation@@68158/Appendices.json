The $(a,q)$-plane is divided into regions of stable (bounded solutions) and unstable (unbounded solutions) behavior.\n\nThe boundaries between these regions correspond to parameter values for which the Mathieu equation admits periodic solutions. These boundary curves are denoted by $a_n(q)$ and $b_n(q)$ for non-negative integers $n$.
