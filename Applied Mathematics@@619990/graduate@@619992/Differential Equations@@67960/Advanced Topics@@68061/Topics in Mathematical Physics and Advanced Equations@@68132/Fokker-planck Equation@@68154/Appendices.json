This practice explores the concept of the stationary, or equilibrium, state where the probability distribution no longer changes with time. By solving the Fokker-Planck equation for a particle confined between two impenetrable walls, you will practice implementing reflecting boundary conditions and discover the system's simple and intuitive long-term configuration [@problem_id:1934595].", "problem": "Consider a simplified model of a biological process where a single protein is confined to move along a very narrow, one-dimensional channel of length $L$. The protein's position is denoted by $x$, where the channel extends from $x=0$ to $x=L$. The protein undergoes random thermal motion (Brownian motion), which can be characterized by a constant diffusion coefficient $D$. The ends of the channel at $x=0$ and $x=L$ are impenetrable, meaning the protein cannot leave the channel and is perfectly reflected at these boundaries. After a very long time, the system reaches a statistical equilibrium, and the probability of finding the protein at any particular position becomes time-independent.\n\nDetermine the equilibrium probability density function, $P(x)$, for the position of the protein within the channel. Your final expression should be a function of the position $x$ and the length $L$.
