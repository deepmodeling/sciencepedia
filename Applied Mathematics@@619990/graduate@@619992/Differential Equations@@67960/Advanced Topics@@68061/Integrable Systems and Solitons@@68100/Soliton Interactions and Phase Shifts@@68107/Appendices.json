This equation admits exact soliton solutions.

We are given $k_1 > k_2$. The phase shift is the difference between the soliton's center position in the distant future ($t \\to +\\infty$) and its projected position from the distant past ($t \\to -\\infty$).\n\nThe solution $u(x,t)$ is determined by $F(x,t)$. We need to analyze the asymptotic behavior of $F(x,t)$ to identify the position of the soliton with wavenumber $k_1$. We do this by considering a reference frame moving with the velocity $v_1$ of the faster soliton, i.e., where $x-v_1 t$ is approximately constant.\n\n**1. Asymptotic behavior for $t \\to -\\infty$ (before the interaction)**\n\nLet's find the position of soliton 1 before the interaction. In this limit, the faster soliton (1) is far to the left of the slower soliton (2). We consider a region around soliton 1, so $x \\approx v_1 t$. In this frame, the phase $\\eta_1 = 2k_1(x - v_1 t - x_{01})$ remains finite.\n\nNow let's examine the phase $\\eta_2$ in this limit:\n$$\\eta_2 = 2k_2(x - v_2 t - x_{02}) = 2k_2((x - v_1 t) + (v_1 - v_2)t - x_{02})$$\nSince $x - v_1 t$ is finite and $v_1 - v_2 = 4\\beta(k_1^2 - k_2^2) > 0$, the term $(v_1 - v_2)t$ dominates as $t \\to -\\infty$.\n$$\\lim_{t \\to -\\infty} \\eta_2 = -\\infty$$\nTherefore, $e^{\\eta_2} \\to 0$ in this limit. The function $F(x,t)$ simplifies to:\n$$F(x,t) \\approx 1 + e^{\\eta_1}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $u(x,t)$:\n$$u(x,t) \\approx \\frac{12\\beta}{\\alpha} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} \\ln(1 + e^{\\eta_1})$$\nThis is the expression for a single soliton. To find its center, we can note that $\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} \\ln(1 + e^{\\eta_1}) = k_1^2\\text{sech}^2(\\eta_1/2)$. The peak of the soliton occurs where the argument of the hyperbolic secant is zero, i.e., $\\eta_1 = 0$.\n$$2k_1(x - v_1 t - x_{01}) = 0 \\implies x = v_1 t + x_{01}$$\nSo, for $t \\to -\\infty$, the trajectory of soliton 1 is $x_{1, \\text{before}}(t) = v_1 t + x_{01}$.\n\n**2. Asymptotic behavior for $t \\to +\\infty$ (after the interaction)**\n\nIn this limit, the faster soliton (1) has passed the slower soliton (2) and is now far to its right. We again consider the frame moving with soliton 1, so $x \\approx v_1 t$ and $\\eta_1$ is finite.\nWe examine $\\eta_2$:\n$$\\eta_2 = 2k_2((x - v_1 t) + (v_1 - v_2)t - x_{02})$$\nAs $t \\to +\\infty$, the term $(v_1 - v_2)t$ goes to $+\\infty$.\n$$\\lim_{t \\to +\\infty} \\eta_2 = +\\infty$$\nTherefore, $e^{\\eta_2} \\to \\infty$. We can approximate $F(x,t)$ by factoring out the dominant term $e^{\\eta_2}$:\n$$F(x,t) = e^{\\eta_2} (e^{-\\eta_2} + e^{\\eta_1-\\eta_2} + 1 + A_{12} e^{\\eta_1}) \\approx e^{\\eta_2}(1 + A_{12} e^{\\eta_1})$$\nNow we take the logarithm:\n$$\\ln F(x,t) \\approx \\ln(e^{\\eta_2}) + \\ln(1 + A_{12} e^{\\eta_1}) = \\eta_2 + \\ln(1 + A_{12} e^{\\eta_1})$$\nSubstituting this into the formula for $u(x,t)$:\n$$u(x,t) \\approx \\frac{12\\beta}{\\alpha} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} \\left[ \\eta_2 + \\ln(1 + A_{12} e^{\\eta_1}) \\right]$$\nThe first term, $\\eta_2 = 2k_2(x - v_2 t - x_{02})$, is linear in $x$, so its second derivative with respect to $x$ is zero.\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 \\eta_2}{\\partial x^2} = 0$$\nThe solution is thus determined by the second term:\n$$u(x,t) \\approx \\frac{12\\beta}{\\alpha} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} \\ln(1 + A_{12} e^{\\eta_1})$$\nThis again represents a single soliton, but its phase is modified. Let's rewrite the argument of the logarithm: $1 + A_{12} e^{\\eta_1} = 1 + e^{\\eta_1 + \\ln A_{12}}$.\nThe center of this soliton is located where the exponent is zero:\n$$\\eta_1 + \\ln A_{12} = 0$$\n$$2k_1(x - v_1 t - x_{01}) + \\ln A_{12} = 0$$\nSolving for $x$, we find the trajectory of soliton 1 for $t \\to +\\infty$:\n$$x = v_1 t + x_{01} - \\frac{\\ln A_{12}}{2k_1}$$\nSo, for $t \\to +\\infty$, the trajectory is $x_{1, \\text{after}}(t) = v_1 t + x_{01} - \\frac{1}{2k_1} \\ln A_{12}$.\n\n**3. Calculating the phase shift**\n\nThe phase shift $\\Delta x_1$ is the difference in the constant position offset between the \"after\" and \"before\" trajectories.\n$$\\Delta x_1 = (\\text{final position offset}) - (\\text{initial position offset})$$\n$$\\Delta x_1 = \\left(x_{01} - \\frac{\\ln A_{12}}{2k_1}\\right) - x_{01} = -\\frac{1}{2k_1} \\ln A_{12}$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for the interaction coefficient $A_{12}$:\n$$A_{12} = \\left(\\frac{k_1 - k_2}{k_1 + k_2}\\right)^2$$\n$$\\Delta x_1 = -\\frac{1}{2k_1} \\ln\\left[ \\left(\\frac{k_1 - k_2}{k_1 + k_2}\\right)^2 \\right] = -\\frac{2}{2k_1} \\ln\\left| \\frac{k_1 - k_2}{k_1 + k_2} \\right| = -\\frac{1}{k_1} \\ln\\left| \\frac{k_1 - k_2}{k_1 + k_2} \\right|$$\nSince we are given $k_1 > k_2 > 0$, the term $(k_1 - k_2)/(k_1 + k_2)$ is positive and less than 1.
