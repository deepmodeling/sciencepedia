The strategy is to substitute the series expansions for $\\wp(z)$ and its derivative $\\wp'(z)$ into the differential equation and then equate the coefficients of like powers of $z$.\n\nFirst, we write down the given Laurent series for $\\wp(z)$ and find the series for its derivative, $\\wp'(z)$.\nGiven the series for $\\wp(z)$:\n$$ \\wp(z) = z^{-2} + c_2 z^2 + c_4 z^4 + c_6 z^6 + \\dots $$\nDifferentiating term by term with respect to $z$, we get the series for $\\wp'(z)$:\n$$ \\wp'(z) = -2z^{-3} + 2c_2 z + 4c_4 z^3 + 6c_6 z^5 + \\dots $$\n\nNext, we expand the left-hand side (LHS) of the differential equation, $(\\wp'(z))^2$.

For instance, the $z^2$ term would come from $(2c_2 z)^2 + 2(-2z^{-3})(6c_6 z^5) = 4c_2^2 z^2 - 24c_6 z^2$.\nSo, the series for the LHS up to the constant term is:\n$$ (\\wp'(z))^2 = 4z^{-6} - 8c_2 z^{-2} - 16c_4 + O(z^2) $$\n\nNow, we expand the right-hand side (RHS) of the differential equation, $4\\wp(z)^3 - g_2 \\wp(z) - g_3$.\nFirst, let's find the first few terms of $\\wp(z)^3$:\n$$ \\wp(z)^3 = (z^{-2} + c_2 z^2 + c_4 z^4 + \\dots)^3 $$\nWe can use the binomial expansion $(a+b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + \\dots$ with $a=z^{-2}$ and $b = c_2z^2+c_4z^4+\\dots$.\nThe most singular term is $(z^{-2})^3 = z^{-6}$.\nThe term with $z^{-2}$ comes from $3a^2b$, specifically $3(z^{-2})^2(c_2z^2) = 3c_2z^{-2}$.\nThe constant term ($z^0$) also comes from $3a^2b$, specifically $3(z^{-2})^2(c_4z^4) = 3c_4$.\nSo, the expansion for $\\wp(z)^3$ is:\n$$ \\wp(z)^3 = z^{-6} + 3c_2 z^{-2} + 3c_4 + O(z^2) $$\nNow we can assemble the series for the entire RHS:\n$$ RHS = 4(z^{-6} + 3c_2 z^{-2} + 3c_4 + O(z^2)) - g_2(z^{-2} + c_2 z^2 + \\dots) - g_3 $$\n$$ RHS = 4z^{-6} + 12c_2 z^{-2} + 12c_4 + O(z^2) - g_2 z^{-2} - g_2 c_2 z^2 - \\dots - g_3 $$\nGrouping terms by powers of $z$:\n$$ RHS = 4z^{-6} + (12c_2 - g_2)z^{-2} + (12c_4 - g_3) + O(z^2) $$\n\nFinally, we equate the coefficients of the LHS and RHS series expansions.\n$$ 4z^{-6} - 8c_2 z^{-2} - 16c_4 + \\dots = 4z^{-6} + (12c_2 - g_2)z^{-2} + (12c_4 - g_3) + \\dots $$\n\nComparing the coefficients of $z^{-6}$:\n$4 = 4$.

So, we can write the polynomial as:\n$$P(t) = (t-1)(4t^2 + 4t + 1)$$\nThe quadratic factor can be factored further. We recognize it as a perfect square:\n$$4t^2 + 4t + 1 = (2t)^2 + 2(2t)(1) + 1^2 = (2t+1)^2$$\nThus, the complete factorization of $P(t)$ is:\n$$P(t) = (t-1)(2t+1)^2$$\nThe roots of $P(t)=0$ are found by setting each factor to zero:\n$t-1 = 0 \\implies t = 1$\n$(2t+1)^2 = 0 \\implies 2t+1 = 0 \\implies t = -1/2$\n\nThe root $t=-1/2$ has a multiplicity of 2, while the root $t=1$ has a multiplicity of 1.\nThe set of the three critical values is therefore $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\} = \\{1, -1/2, -1/2\\}$.\n\nIn this set, one value, $-1/2$, appears twice, and the other value, $1$, appears once.
