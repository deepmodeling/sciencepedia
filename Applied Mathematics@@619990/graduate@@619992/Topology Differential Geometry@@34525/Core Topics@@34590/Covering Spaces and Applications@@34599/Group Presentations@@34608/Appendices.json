For example, $a^2ba^{-2} = a(aba^{-1})a^{-1} = a(b^2)a^{-1} = (aba^{-1})^2 = (b^2)^2 = b^4$. By induction, we can establish the general formula:\n$$\na^k b a^{-k} = b^{2^k}\n$$\nWe are given the relation $a^6=1$. This means that conjugation by $a^6$ is the same as conjugation by the identity element, which does nothing. Therefore, $a^6 b a^{-6} = b$. Using our formula with $k=6$:\n$$\nb = a^6 b a^{-6} = b^{2^6} = b^{64}\n$$\nSo, we must have $b = b^{64}$. Since we also know $b^5=1$, we can reduce the exponent modulo 5: $b^{64} = b^{64 \\bmod 5} = b^4$.\nThe relation $b = b^4$ implies $b^3=1$.\nNow we have two constraints on $b$: $b^5=1$ and $b^3=1$. This implies that the order of $b$ must divide both 5 and 3. The greatest common divisor of 5 and 3 is 1, so the order of $b$ must be 1. This means $b$ must be the identity element, $b=1$.\nSubstituting $b=1$ into the presentation, the relations involving $b$ become trivial, and we are left with $G=\\langle a \\mid a^6=1\\rangle$.

Then, a crucial second step involves constructing a surjective homomorphism from the presented group to a known group, which establishes a lower bound.

We first manipulate the relations to find consequences.\n\n1.  **Derive key identities:**\n    From the first relation, $xyx = y$. Multiplying by $x$ on the right of the second relation, $yxy=x$, gives $yxyx = x^2$. But we can regroup the left side as $y(xyx) = y(y) = y^2$. Thus, we have $x^2 = y^2$.\n    Let $z = x^2 = y^2$. Let's see if $z$ is central (commutes with all generators).\n    $zx = x^2x = x^3$. $xz = xx^2 = x^3$. So $z$ commutes with $x$.\n    $zy = y^2y = y^3$. $yz = y(x^2) = y(y^2) = y^3$. So $z$ commutes with $y$.\n    Since $z$ commutes with the generators $x$ and $y$, it is a central element.\n\n2.  **Find the order of $z$:**\n    From $xyx=y$, we can write $yxy^{-1} = x^{-1}$. To prove this: $yxy^{-1} = (xyx)xy^{-1} = x(yxy)y^{-1} = x(x)y^{-1} = x^2y^{-1} = zy^{-1}$. So we need to show $zy^{-1}=x^{-1}$. Since $z=y^2$, this is $y^2y^{-1}=y$. So we need to show $y=x^{-1}$, which is not necessarily true.\n    Let's try another way. From $xyx=y$, we get $xy=yx^{-1}$. Then $yxy^{-1}=(yx^{-1})y^{-1}=yx^{-1}y^{-1}$. This isn't helping.\n    Let's use the centrality of $z=x^2$.\n    $(yxy^{-1})^2 = (x^{-1})^2 \\implies yx^2y^{-1} = x^{-2}$.\n    Since $x^2=z$ is central, $yzy^{-1} = z$. So the left side is $z$.\n    The right side is $x^{-2} = (x^2)^{-1} = z^{-1}$.\n    So we have $z = z^{-1}$, which implies $z^2 = 1$. This means $x^4=1$ and $y^4=1$.\n\n3.  **Establish an upper bound for $|G|$:**\n    We have the relations $x^2=y^2=z$, $z$ is central, and $z^2=1$. Also, from $xyx=y$, we have $yx=x^{-1}y=x^3y$. This last rule allows us to rewrite any word in $x$ and $y$ so that all powers of $x$ come before powers of $y$. Any element of $G$ can be written in the form $x^a y^b$ where $a \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$ and $b \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. This gives at most $4 \\times 2 = 8$ distinct elements: $\\{1, x, x^2, x^3, y, xy, x^2y, x^3y\\}$. Thus, $|G| \\leq 8$.\n\n4.  **Establish a lower bound for $|G|$:**\n    To show that $|G| \\geq 8$, we need to show that these 8 elements are indeed distinct. We can do this by constructing a surjective homomorphism from $G$ to a known group of order 8. The relations we've derived ($x^4=1$, $x^2=y^2$, $yxy^{-1}=x^{-1}$) are defining relations for the quaternion group $Q_8 = \\{\\pm 1, \\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$.\n    However, we must verify that our original relations hold in $Q_8$. Let's define a homomorphism $\\varphi: G \\to Q_8$ by setting $\\varphi(x)=i$ and $\\varphi(y)=j$.\n    - Check the first relation: $\\varphi(xyx) = iji = i(-k) = -(-j)=j$. This matches $\\varphi(y)=j$. The first relation holds.\n    - Check the second relation: $\\varphi(yxy) = jij = j(-k) = -(jk)=-i$. This must match $\\varphi(x)=i$. Since $-i \\neq i$, the second relation does not hold for this mapping.\n\n    Let's try a different mapping. Let $\\varphi(x)=i$ and $\\varphi(y)=k$.\n    - Check the first relation: $\\varphi(xyx) = iki = i(-j) = -(ij)=-k$. This must match $\\varphi(y)=k$. It does not.\n\n    There is a more robust way using linear algebra. Consider the group $SL(2, \\mathbb{F}_3)$ of $2 \\times 2$ matrices with determinant 1 over the field of 3 elements. Let $X = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $Y = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1 \\\\ 1  -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    One can verify:\n    - $XYX = Y$\n    - $YXY = X$\n    Since these matrices satisfy the relations of $G$, there is a homomorphism $\\varphi: G \\to SL(2, \\mathbb{F}_3)$. The image of this map is the subgroup generated by $X$ and $Y$, which is known to be isomorphic to $Q_8$ and thus has order 8. This proves that $|G| \\geq 8$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Combining $|G| \\leq 8$ and $|G| \\geq 8$ gives $|G| = 8$.
