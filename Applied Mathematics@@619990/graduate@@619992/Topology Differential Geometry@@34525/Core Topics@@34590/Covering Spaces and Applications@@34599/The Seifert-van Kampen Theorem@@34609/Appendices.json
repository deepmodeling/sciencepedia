This problem [@problem_id:1064285] guides you through the process of abelianization and the analysis of group structure, showcasing the deep connections between the fundamental group, homology theory, and the algebra of finitely generated abelian groups.", "problem": "This problem explores the topological structure that arises from modifying a 2-torus.\n\n**Background:**\n1.  The 2-torus, $T^2$, is the surface of a donut. Its fundamental group, $\\pi_1(T^2, x_0)$, based at a point $x_0$, is isomorphic to the direct product of two copies of the integers, $\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$. The generators of this group, denoted $a$ and $b$, correspond to loops along the longitudinal and latitudinal directions of the torus. Since the group is abelian, any element can be uniquely written as $a^p b^q$ for integers $p$ and $q$.\n2.  A new topological space, denoted $X_{p,q}$, is constructed from a 2-torus $T^2$ by attaching a 2-cell (a disk, $D^2$) via an attaching map $f: \\partial D^2 \\to T^2$. The path traced by this map is in the homotopy class of the element $a^p b^q \\in \\pi_1(T^2, x_0)$.\n3.  For two based topological spaces $(X, x_0)$ and $(Y, y_0)$, their **wedge sum**, denoted $X \\vee Y$, is formed by taking the disjoint union of $X$ and $Y$ and identifying their basepoints, i.e., $X \\vee Y = (X \\sqcup Y) / (x_0 \\sim y_0)$.\n4.  The first homology group of a path-connected space $M$, denoted $H_1(M, \\mathbb{Z})$, is the abelianization of its fundamental group. If $\\pi_1(M)$ is given by a set of generators $g_i$ and relations $r_j$, its abelianization is obtained by adding relations $[g_i, g_j]=1$ for all pairs of generators.\n5.  A finitely generated abelian group $G$ can be uniquely decomposed into the direct sum $G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^k \\oplus T$, where $k \\ge 0$ is an integer called the rank of the group, and $T$ is a finite abelian group called the **torsion subgroup**. The order of a group is the number of its elements.\n\n**Problem:**\nConsider two spaces, $X_{p,q}$ and $X_{r,s}$, constructed from a 2-torus as described above, with non-zero integer parameters $(p,q)$ and $(r,s)$ respectively.
