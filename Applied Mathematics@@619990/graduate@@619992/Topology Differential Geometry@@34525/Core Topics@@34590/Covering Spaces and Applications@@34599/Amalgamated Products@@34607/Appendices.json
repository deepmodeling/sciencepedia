This powerful visual framework allows us to understand the group's action geometrically. This first exercise invites you to explore this structure by calculating the number of vertices at a certain distance from a base vertex, directly connecting the algebraic definition to a concrete object whose local geometry is determined by the indices $[G_1:H]$ and $[G_2:H]$ [@problem_id:915001].", "problem": "Consider the amalgamated free product of two dihedral groups, $G = D_4 *_{H} D_6$. The group $D_n$ is the dihedral group of order $2n$, with presentation $D_n = \\langle r, s \\mid r^n = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{-1} \\rangle$. The amalgamated subgroup $H$ is a central subgroup of order 2 in both factors. Specifically, $D_4$ is given by $\\langle r_4, s_4 \\mid r_4^4 = s_4^2 = 1, s_4r_4s_4 = r_4^{-1} \\rangle$, and its center is $Z(D_4) = \\{1, r_4^2\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$. Similarly, $D_6$ is given by $\\langle r_6, s_6 \\mid r_6^6 = s_6^2 = 1, s_6r_6s_6 = r_6^{-1} \\rangle$, and its center is $Z(D_6) = \\{1, r_6^3\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$. The amalgamation identifies these two central subgroups, $H \\cong Z(D_4) \\cong Z(D_6)$, via the isomorphism mapping $r_4^2$ to $r_6^3$.\n\nThe group $G$ acts on a tree, known as the Bass-Serre tree $T$. For an amalgamated product $G = G_1 *_H G_2$, the set of vertices of $T$ is the disjoint union of the sets of left cosets $V(T) = G/G_1 \\sqcup G/G_2$. The edges of $T$ are given by the left cosets $E(T) = G/H$. An edge corresponding to the coset $gH$ connects the vertex $gG_1$ to the vertex $gG_2$. The distance between two vertices in the tree is the number of edges in the unique shortest path connecting them.\n\nLet $v_0$ be the vertex corresponding to the trivial coset $1 \\cdot D_4 = D_4$. Calculate the total number of distinct vertices in the Bass-Serre tree $T$ that are at a distance of exactly 2 from $v_0$.", "solution": "1.
