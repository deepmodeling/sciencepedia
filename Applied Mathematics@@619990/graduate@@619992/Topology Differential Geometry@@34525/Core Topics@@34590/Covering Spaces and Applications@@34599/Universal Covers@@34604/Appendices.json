This means that if $g$ is conjugate to $h$ (i.e., $g = k h k^{-1}$ for some $k$), then $\\tau(g) = \\tau(h)$.\n\nThe value of the translation length is given by the length of the unique cyclically reduced word in the conjugacy class of $g$. A word $w = w_1w_2...w_n$ is cyclically reduced if it contains no substrings of the form $x x^{-1}$ or $x^{-1}x$ (i.e., it is a reduced word) and its first letter is not the inverse of its last letter ($w_1 \\neq w_n^{-1}$).\n\nThe length of a path corresponding to a word is the sum of the lengths of the edges traversed. For a word $v=v_1...v_m$, its length is $L(v) = \\sum_{i=1}^m L_{v_i}$, where $L_{a^{\\pm 1}} = L_a$ and $L_{b^{\\pm 1}} = L_b$.\n\nOur task is to find the cyclically reduced word conjugate to $g = ab^2ab^{-1}a^{-1}$ and then compute its length.\n\n**Step 2: Perform cyclic reduction on the given word**\nThe given word is $w = ab^2ab^{-1}a^{-1}$.\nFirst, we check if it is reduced. There are no adjacent inverse letters (like $aa^{-1}$ or $bb^{-1}$), so it is a reduced word.\n\nNext, we check if it is cyclically reduced. The first letter is $w_1 = a$ and the last letter is $w_5 = a^{-1}$. Since $w_1 = w_5^{-1}$, the word is not cyclically reduced.\n\nTo find the cyclically reduced representative, we use the property that $uvu^{-1}$ is conjugate to $v$.\nOur word $w$ has the form $a \\cdot (b^2ab^{-1}) \\cdot a^{-1}$. Let $u=a$ and $v=b^2ab^{-1}$.\nThen $w$ is conjugate to $v$.\n$$ g \\sim v = b^2ab^{-1} $$\nSo, we have $\\tau(g) = \\tau(v)$.\n\n**Step 3: Continue the cyclic reduction**\nNow we consider the new word $v = b^2ab^{-1}$.\nFirst, we check if $v$ is reduced. It is, as there are no adjacent inverse letters.\nNext, we check if $v$ is cyclically reduced. The first letter is $v_1 = b$ and the last letter is $v_4 = b^{-1}$. Since $v_1 = v_4^{-1}$, this word is also not cyclically reduced.\n\nWe repeat the reduction process. The word $v = b(ba)b^{-1}$. Let $u' = b$ and $v' = ba$.\nThen $v$ is conjugate to $v'$.\n$$ v \\sim v' = ba $$\nSo, we have $\\tau(v) = \\tau(v')$, and thus $\\tau(g) = \\tau(v')$.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the final word and compute its length**\nNow we consider the word $v' = ba$.\nIs it reduced? Yes.\nIs it cyclically reduced? The first letter is $b$ and the last letter is $a$. Since $a$ and $b$ are free generators, $a \\neq b^{-1}$. Therefore, $v' = ba$ is cyclically reduced.\n\nThe unique cyclically reduced word in the conjugacy class of $g$ is $ba$.\nThe translation length $\\tau(g)$ is the length of the path corresponding to this word. The path consists of one edge of type $b$ followed by one edge of type $a$.\n\nThe length of this path is the sum of the edge lengths:\n$$ L(ba) = L_b + L_a $$\n\nTherefore, the translation length of $g$ is:\n$$ \\tau(g) = L_a + L_b $$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{L_a + L_b} $$", "id": "1080980"}, {"introduction": "The principles of deck transformations and translation length are not confined to combinatorial trees; they are fundamental to understanding the geometry of surfaces.
