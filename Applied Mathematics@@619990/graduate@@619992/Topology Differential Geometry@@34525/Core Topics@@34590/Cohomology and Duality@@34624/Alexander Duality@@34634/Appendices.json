This practice demonstrates how the duality between a subspace and its complement can be used to rigorously prove the Jordan Curve Theorem. By calculating the number of path-components of the complement of a simple closed curve in the plane, you will solidify your understanding of the core isomorphism at the heart of the duality principle. [@problem_id:1631631]", "problem": "In digital image processing and computational geometry, it is often necessary to analyze the regions defined by a closed curve on a plane. Consider a simplified model where the plane is represented by the two-dimensional Euclidean space, $\\mathbb{R}^2$. A simple closed curve, such as a circle or any shape continuously deformable into a circle without self-intersection, is topologically equivalent to the 1-sphere, $S^1$. Let $C$ be such a curve embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The curve divides the plane into distinct regions. In algebraic topology, the number of these disjoint regions (formally, path-components) can be determined by calculating the rank of the 0-th homology group, $H_0(\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus C; \\mathbb{Z})$, of the complement space $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus C$.\n\nUsing the principles of algebraic topology, specifically the relationship between the homology of a space and the cohomology of its subspace, determine the number of path-components of the complement of a simple closed curve $C$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Provide this number as your answer.", "solution": "The problem asks for the number of path-components of the space $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus C$, where $C$ is a simple closed curve in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This number is equal to the rank of the 0-th homology group with integer coefficients, $H_0(\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus C; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nFor any non-empty topological space $X$, the rank of its 0-th homology group, $\\text{rank}(H_0(X; \\mathbb{Z}))$, is equal to the number of its path-components. The 0-th homology group $H_0(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ is related to the 0-th reduced homology group $\\tilde{H}_0(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ by the direct sum decomposition $H_0(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\tilde{H}_0(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$.

Our goal is to compute the rank of $\\tilde{H}_0(\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus C; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nTo find the homology of the complement space, we employ Alexander Duality. For a compact, non-empty, and locally contractible subspace $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, Alexander Duality states that there is an isomorphism between the reduced homology of the complement and the reduced cohomology of the subspace:\n$$ \\tilde{H}_i(\\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus A; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\tilde{H}^{n-i-1}(A; \\mathbb{Z}) $$\nIn our problem, the ambient space is $\\mathbb{R}^2$, so $n=2$. The subspace is the simple closed curve $C$, so $A=C$. The problem states that $C$ is topologically equivalent to the 1-sphere, $S^1$. Since $S^1$ is compact and locally contractible, we can apply the duality theorem. We are interested in the 0-th reduced homology group of the complement, so we set $i=0$. The duality formula gives:\n$$ \\tilde{H}_0(\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus C; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\tilde{H}^{2-0-1}(C; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\tilde{H}^1(C; \\mathbb{Z}) $$\nSince $C$ is homeomorphic to $S^1$, we have $\\tilde{H}^1(C; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\tilde{H}^1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z})$.

The Ext group $\\text{Ext}(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbb{Z})$ is zero, as $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a free abelian group.\nThus, we have:\n$$ H^1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus 0 = \\mathbb{Z} $$\nFor any path-connected space $X$, the reduced cohomology groups $\\tilde{H}^k(X)$ are isomorphic to the ordinary cohomology groups $H^k(X)$ for $k \\ge 1$. Therefore, for $k=1$:\n$$ \\tilde{H}^1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H^1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} $$\nSubstituting this result back into our expression from Alexander Duality:\n$$ \\tilde{H}_0(\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus C; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\tilde{H}^1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} $$\nThe rank of the group $\\mathbb{Z}$ is 1.
