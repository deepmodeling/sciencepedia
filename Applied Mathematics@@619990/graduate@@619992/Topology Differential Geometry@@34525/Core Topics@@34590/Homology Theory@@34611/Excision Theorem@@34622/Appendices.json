A pair $(X, A)$ is called a good pair if the subspace $A$ is closed and is a deformation retract of some neighborhood in $X$. In our case, $X = \\mathbb{R}P^2$ and $A$ is a closed disk. Since $\\mathbb{R}P^2$ is a manifold, any compact submanifold (like the closed disk $A$) has a tubular neighborhood that deformation retracts onto it.

The space $\\mathbb{R}P^2$ is a compact 2-manifold. Collapsing a closed disk (a 2-cell) embedded within it to a point does not change the global topological structure of the manifold. To see this more formally, consider $\\mathbb{R}P^2$ as the quotient of the 2-sphere $S^2$ under the identification of antipodal points, $x \\sim -x$. The embedded disk $A$ in $\\mathbb{R}P^2$ is the image of a small closed disk, say $D_S$, on $S^2$ that does not contain any pair of antipodal points. The quotient space $\\mathbb{R}P^2/A$ is then homeomorphic to $(S^2/D_S)/\\sim$, where $\\sim$ is the antipodal identification. The space $S^2$ with a disk $D_S$ collapsed to a point is homeomorphic to $S^2$. The antipodal map on the original $S^2$ induces a corresponding antipodal map on this new $S^2$. Therefore, the resulting quotient space is still homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}P^2$.\nSo, we have the homeomorphism $\\mathbb{R}P^2/A \\cong \\mathbb{R}P^2$.\n\nThis simplifies our problem greatly:\n$$H_n(\\mathbb{R}P^2, A) \\cong \\tilde{H}_n(\\mathbb{R}P^2/A) \\cong \\tilde{H}_n(\\mathbb{R}P^2)$$\n\nNow we need the homology groups of the real projective plane, $\\mathbb{R}P^2$, with integer coefficients.
