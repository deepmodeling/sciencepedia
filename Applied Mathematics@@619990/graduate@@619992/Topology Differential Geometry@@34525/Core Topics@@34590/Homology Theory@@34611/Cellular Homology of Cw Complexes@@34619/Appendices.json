The attaching map for both $U$ and $L$ is a map from the boundary circle $S^1$ to the 1-skeleton $X^1 = S^1_a \\vee S^1_b$, defined by traversing the loop $a$ in the positive direction and then the loop $b$ in the negative direction.\n\nFor a CW complex $X$, the cellular chain complex $(C_*(X), d_*)$ is defined as follows.
