This problem concerns the effect of this subdivision on the boundary of a simplex.\n\n**Background:**\n\n1.  **Oriented Simplices and Chains:** An oriented $p$-simplex is denoted by $[v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_p]$, where the $v_i$ are vertices. A different ordering of vertices defines the same simplex but with a sign change determined by the sign of the permutation. For a given simplicial complex $K$, the group of $p$-chains, $C_p(K)$, is the free abelian group with basis given by the oriented $p$-simplices of $K$. An element of $C_p(K)$ is a formal sum $c = \\sum_i a_i \\sigma_i$, where $a_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\sigma_i$ are $p$-simplices.\n\n2.  **Boundary Operator:** The boundary operator $\\partial_p: C_p(K) \\to C_{p-1}(K)$ is a homomorphism defined on a basis $p$-simplex $\\sigma = [v_0, \\dots, v_p]$ as:\n    $$\n    \\partial_p(\\sigma) = \\sum_{i=0}^{p} (-1)^i [v_0, \\dots, \\hat{v_i}, \\dots, v_p]\n    $$\n    where $\\hat{v_i}$ denotes the omission of the vertex $v_i$. A fundamental property is that $\\partial_{p-1} \\circ \\partial_p = 0$.\n\n3.  **Barycentric Subdivision:** The barycenter of a $p$-simplex $\\sigma = [v_0, \\dots, v_p]$ is the point $b_{\\sigma}$ which is the average of its vertices. We denote the barycenter of a simplex with vertices indexed by $i_0, \\dots, i_k$ as $b_{i_0 \\dots i_k}$. The barycentric subdivision of $K$, denoted $sd(K)$, is a new simplicial complex whose vertices are the barycenters of all simplices in $K$.\n\n4.  **Subdivision Chain Map:** The subdivision gives rise to a chain map $sd_p: C_p(K) \\to C_p(sd(K))$, which can be defined recursively. For a $p$-chain $c$, we define its cone with apex $w$ as $w \\cdot c \\in C_{p+1}$. If $c = \\sum_i a_i \\sigma_i$, then $w \\cdot c = \\sum_i a_i [w, \\sigma_i]$. The subdivision map is then defined by:\n    -   $sd_0([v]) = [v]$ for a 0-simplex.\n    -   For $p > 0$, $sd_p(\\sigma) = b_{\\sigma} \\cdot (sd_{p-1}(\\partial_p \\sigma))$ for a $p$-simplex $\\sigma$.\n\n**Problem:**\n\nLet $\\sigma = [v_0, v_1, v_2]$ be a single oriented 2-simplex.
