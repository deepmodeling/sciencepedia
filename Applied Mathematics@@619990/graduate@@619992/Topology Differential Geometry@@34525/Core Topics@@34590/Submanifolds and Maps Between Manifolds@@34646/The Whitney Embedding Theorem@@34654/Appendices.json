For a curve in the Euclidean plane, this condition simplifies significantly. Consider a parameterized curve $\\gamma: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ given by $\\gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t))$. This map is an immersion if its tangent vector, $\\gamma'(t) = (x'(t), y'(t))$, is non-zero for all values of the parameter $t$.

The space $M$ is a disjoint union of two smooth manifolds: the circle $S^1$ and the 2-sphere $S^2$.\nThe dimension of the circle $S^1$ is $\\dim(S^1) = 1$.\nThe dimension of the 2-sphere $S^2$ is $\\dim(S^2) = 2$.\nAs stated in the problem, the effective dimension of a disjoint union of manifolds is the maximum of the dimensions of its components.\nTherefore, the effective dimension of $M$ is $d = \\max(\\dim(S^1), \\dim(S^2)) = \\max(1, 2) = 2$.\n\nNext, we need to find the guaranteed embedding dimension $N$ for $M$. The procedure involves applying the strong Whitney Embedding Theorem to each component and then constructing a combined embedding.\n\nThe strong Whitney Embedding Theorem guarantees that a smooth $m$-dimensional manifold can be embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^{2m}$.\n\nFor the first component, $S^1$, we have dimension $m_1 = 1$. The theorem guarantees an embedding $f_1: S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^{2m_1} = \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nFor the second component, $S^2$, we have dimension $m_2 = 2$. The theorem guarantees an embedding $f_2: S^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^{2m_2} = \\mathbb{R}^4$.\n\nNow, we must construct a single embedding for the entire space $M = S^1 \\sqcup S^2$ into a common Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^N$. A standard method to embed a disjoint union of two manifolds, $M_1 \\sqcup M_2$, where $f_1: M_1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^{k_1}$ and $f_2: M_2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^{k_2}$ are embeddings, is as follows:\n1. Embed both manifolds into a common Euclidean space of dimension $k = \\max(k_1, k_2)$. We can define new embeddings $g_1: M_1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^k$ and $g_2: M_2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^k$ by padding with zeros. For example, if $k_1 < k$, we can define $g_1(p) = (f_1(p), 0, \\dots, 0)$.\n2. Use an additional coordinate to separate the images of the two manifolds. Define a map $F: M_1 \\sqcup M_2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^{k+1}$ by:\n   $F(p) = (g_1(p), 0)$ for $p \\in M_1$\n   $F(q) = (g_2(q), 1)$ for $q \\in M_2$\n\nThis map $F$ is an embedding. Its image for $M_1$ lies entirely in the hyperplane where the last coordinate is 0, and its image for $M_2$ lies entirely in the hyperplane where the last coordinate is 1. Since the images are disjoint and the original maps were embeddings, $F$ is an embedding of the disjoint union $M_1 \\sqcup M_2$ into $\\mathbb{R}^{k+1}$.\n\nApplying this procedure to our problem:\nGuaranteed embedding for $S^1$ is in $\\mathbb{R}^{k_1} = \\mathbb{R}^2$.\nGuaranteed embedding for $S^2$ is in $\\mathbb{R}^{k_2} = \\mathbb{R}^4$.\nThe dimension of the common space is $k = \\max(k_1, k_2) = \\max(2, 4) = 4$.\nSo, we can embed both $S^1$ and $S^2$ into $\\mathbb{R}^4$.
