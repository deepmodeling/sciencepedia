This problem explores their behavior in the simplest non-trivial setting: Euclidean space.\n\nConsider the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ equipped with its standard flat metric. In this space, the Riemann curvature tensor $R$ is identically zero. Geodesics in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ are simply straight lines, which can be parameterized by $\\gamma(t) = p + tv$, where $p$ and $v$ are constant vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and $v$ is a non-zero vector.\n\nA Jacobi field $J(t)$ along a geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ is a vector field along $\\gamma$ that satisfies the Jacobi equation:\n$$ \\frac{D^2 J}{dt^2} + R(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = 0 $$\nwhere $\\frac{D}{dt}$ represents the covariant derivative along $\\gamma(t)$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}$ is the velocity vector of the geodesic.
