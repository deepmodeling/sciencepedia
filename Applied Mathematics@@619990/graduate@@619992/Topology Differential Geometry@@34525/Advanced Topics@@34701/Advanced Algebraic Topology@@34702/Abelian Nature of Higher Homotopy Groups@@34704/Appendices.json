The proof of this relies on a \"little squares\" argument, which demonstrates that for any two homotopy classes represented by maps $\\alpha, \\beta: I^n \\to X$, the composition $\\alpha * \\beta$ is homotopic to $\\beta * \\alpha$. For $n=2$, this can be visualized as moving the supports of the maps $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ around each other within the unit square $I^2 = [0,1] \\times [0,1]$.\n\nThis problem asks you to compute a geometric quantity associated with a specific instance of such a homotopy. Let two maps, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, be represented by their square supports, $S_\\alpha$ and $S_\\beta$, within $I^2$. At any time $t \\in [0,1]$ of the homotopy, the map is given by a rescaled version of $\\alpha$ on the square $S_\\alpha(t)$ and a rescaled version of $\\beta$ on the square $S_\\beta(t)$, while the rest of $I^2$ is mapped to the basepoint.
