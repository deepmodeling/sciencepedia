This first exercise explores the necessity of the \"simply-connected\" hypothesis. By constructing a space that is acyclic (i.e., has the same homology as a point) but is not contractible, we can directly investigate why a non-trivial fundamental group can obstruct the relationship between homology and homotopy type that the theorem describes [@problem_id:1636313].", "problem": "A cornerstone of algebraic topology, Whitehead's theorem, provides conditions under which a map between topological spaces is a homotopy equivalence. One version of the theorem states that if a map $f: X \\to Y$ between connected, simply-connected CW complexes induces isomorphisms on all integral homology groups, then $f$ is a homotopy equivalence.\n\nTo demonstrate the necessity of the \"simply-connected\" condition, one can construct a space that has the same homology as a point but is not contractible. Consider a 2-dimensional cell complex, denoted $X$, constructed via the following procedure:\n1.  Begin with a single 0-cell, denoted $p$.\n2.  Attach two 1-cells, labeled $u$ and $v$, to the 0-cell $p$. This forms the 1-skeleton $X^1$, which is topologically equivalent to a wedge of two circles, $S^1 \\vee S^1$.\n3.  Attach a 2-cell, $E_1$, to $X^1$ via an attaching map whose boundary path follows the word $u^{-1}v^2uv^{-3}$.\n4.  Attach a second 2-cell, $E_2$, to $X^1$ via an attaching map whose boundary path follows the word $v^{-1}u^2vu^{-3}$.\n\nIt can be shown that this cell complex $X$ is non-contractible, yet its integral homology groups are identical to those of a single point (i.e., $H_0(X;\\mathbb{Z})=\\mathbb{Z}$ and $H_k(X;\\mathbb{Z})=0$ for all $k \\ge 1$). The failure of $X$ to be contractible, despite being acyclic, is due to a specific property of its fundamental group, $\\pi_1(X,p)$.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes this group?\n\nA.

The group is abelian and non-trivial.", "solution": "We analyze the fundamental group of the given 2-dimensional CW complex using the standard presentation arising from the 1-skeleton and attaching maps of the 2-cells. The 1-skeleton is $X^{1} \\simeq S^{1} \\vee S^{1}$ with one $0$-cell $p$ and two $1$-cells $u$ and $v$, so $\\pi_{1}(X^{1},p)$ is the free group on two generators $u$ and $v$. Attaching the $2$-cells along the words $u^{-1}v^{2}uv^{-3}$ and $v^{-1}u^{2}vu^{-3}$ adds the corresponding relations in the fundamental group.

Abelianizing the relators means summing exponents additively in $\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$ with generators corresponding to $u$ and $v$:\n- For $u^{-1}v^{2}uv^{-3}$, the total exponent of $u$ is $-1+1=0$ and of $v$ is $2-3=-1$, so the relation gives $-v=0$, hence $v=0$ in the abelianization.\n- For $v^{-1}u^{2}vu^{-3}$, the total exponent of $v$ is $-1+1=0$ and of $u$ is $2-3=-1$, so the relation gives $-u=0$, hence $u=0$ in the abelianization.\n\nThus,\n$$\n\\pi_{1}(X,p)^{\\mathrm{ab}} \\cong 0,\n$$\nso the group is perfect, i.e., it equals its own commutator subgroup.\n\nNext, we show the group is nontrivial. If $\\pi_{1}(X,p)$ were trivial, then $X$ would be simply connected. The space $X$ is acyclic by hypothesis, meaning $H_{0}(X;\\mathbb{Z})\\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and $H_{k}(X;\\mathbb{Z})=0$ for all $k\\geq 1$. For a simply connected CW complex, a map to a point that induces isomorphisms on all homology groups is a homotopy equivalence by Whiteheadâ€™s theorem. Therefore $X$ would be contractible, contradicting the given that $X$ is non-contractible. Hence $\\pi_{1}(X,p)$ is nontrivial.\n\nCombining these facts, $\\pi_{1}(X,p)$ is nontrivial and perfect. This corresponds to option D, and rules out:\n- A (trivial) by the non-contractibility argument,\n- B (nontrivial finite) as a specific cardinality claim not supported by the construction, while the key property is perfection,\n- C (nontrivial free) since a nontrivial free group has nontrivial abelianization,\n- E (abelian nontrivial) since the abelianization is trivial.\n\nTherefore the correct description is that the group is nontrivial and perfect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1636313"}, {"introduction": "Once the preconditions for the Whitehead theorem are met, it provides a definitive test for homotopy equivalence.
