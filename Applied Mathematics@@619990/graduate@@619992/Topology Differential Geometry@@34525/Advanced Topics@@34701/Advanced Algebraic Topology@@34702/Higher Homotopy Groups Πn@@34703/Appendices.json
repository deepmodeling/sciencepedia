The **real Stiefel manifold** $V_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, where $k \\le n$, is the space of all orthonormal $k$-frames in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. A $k$-frame is an ordered set of $k$ orthonormal vectors $(v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_k)$.\n\n2.  Stiefel manifolds fit into a **fibration sequence**. For $k \\ge 2$, there is a fiber bundle with fiber $V_{k-1}(\\mathbb{R}^{n-1})$, total space $V_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, and base space $S^{n-1}$. The projection map $p: V_k(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\to S^{n-1}$ is given by $p(v_1, \\dots, v_k) = v_1$. This structure is denoted as:\n    $$V_{k-1}(\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}) \\longrightarrow V_k(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\longrightarrow S^{n-1}$$\n\n3.  For the specific case of $V_2(\\mathbb{R}^4)$, the fibration sequence becomes:\n    $$S^2 \\longrightarrow V_2(\\mathbb{R}^4) \\longrightarrow S^3$$\n    This is because $V_1(\\mathbb{R}^3)$ is the space of unit vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, which is the 2-sphere $S^2$.\n\n4.  A **crucial topological property** for this problem is that the tangent bundle of the 3-sphere $S^3$ is trivial. A consequence of this is that the fibration $S^2 \\to V_2(\\mathbb{R}^4) \\to S^3$, which describes the unit tangent bundle of $S^3$, is a **trivial fibration**. This implies that the total space $V_2(\\mathbb{R}^4)$ is homeomorphic to the product of the base and the fiber:\n    $$V_2(\\mathbb{R}^4) \\cong S^3 \\times S^2$$\n\n5.
