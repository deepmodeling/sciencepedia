The corresponding covector is $k_{a} = g_{ab}k^{b} = g_{av}$, which has components $k_{u}=g_{uv}=1$ and all others zero.\n\nTo check if $k^{a}$ is a geodesic congruence, we compute $k^{b}\\nabla_{b}k^{a}=k^{b}(\\partial_{b}k^{a} + \\Gamma^{a}_{bc}k^{c})$. As $k^{a}$ has constant components, this simplifies to $k^{v}k^{v}\\Gamma^{a}_{vv} = \\Gamma^{a}_{vv}$.\n$$\\Gamma^{a}_{vv} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{ad}(\\partial_{v}g_{vd} + \\partial_{v}g_{vd} - \\partial_{d}g_{vv})$$\nSince no metric component depends on $v$, all terms are zero. Thus, $\\Gamma^{a}_{vv}=0$ for all $a$. This proves that $k^{b}\\nabla_{b}k^{a}=0$, so the congruence is geodesic and affinely parametrized (with $v$ as the affine parameter, which we denote by $\\lambda$).\n\nNext, we must show that $\\nabla_{a}k_{b}=0$ and $\\nabla_{a}k^{b}=0$.\nFor the covector $k_{b}$, with components $k_{u}=1$ and others zero, the covariant derivative is $\\nabla_{c}k_{b} = \\partial_{c}k_{b} - \\Gamma^{d}_{cb}k_{d}$. As $k_{b}$ has constant components, this reduces to $\\nabla_{c}k_{b} = -\\Gamma^{d}_{cb}k_{d} = -\\Gamma^{u}_{cb}$. We need to compute $\\Gamma^{u}_{cb}$.\n$$\\Gamma^{u}_{ab} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{ud}(\\partial_{a}g_{bd} + \\partial_{b}g_{ad} - \\partial_{d}g_{ab}) = \\frac{1}{2}g^{uv}(\\partial_{a}g_{bv} + \\partial_{b}g_{av} - \\partial_{v}g_{ab})$$\nAs $\\partial_{v}g_{ab}=0$ and $g_{bv}, g_{av}$ are only non-zero and constant ($=1$) when the index is $u$, all derivatives $\\partial_{a}g_{bv}$ and $\\partial_{b}g_{av}$ are zero. For instance, $\\partial_{a}g_{uv} = \\partial_{a}(1) = 0$. Therefore, $\\Gamma^{u}_{ab}=0$ for all $a,b$. This implies $\\nabla_{c}k_{b} = 0$.\n\nFor the vector $k^{b}$, with components $k^{v}=1$ and others zero, the covariant derivative is $\\nabla_{c}k^{b} = \\partial_{c}k^{b} + \\Gamma^{b}_{ca}k^{a} = \\Gamma^{b}_{ca}k^{v} = \\Gamma^{b}_{cv}$. We need to compute $\\Gamma^{b}_{cv}$.\n$$\\Gamma^{b}_{cv} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{ba}(\\partial_{c}g_{va} + \\partial_{v}g_{ca} - \\partial_{a}g_{cv})$$\nSince $\\partial_{v}g_{ca}=0$, this is $\\Gamma^{b}_{cv} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{ba}(\\partial_{c}g_{va} - \\partial_{a}g_{cv})$. The only non-zero components for $g_{v\\alpha}$ and $g_{c\\beta}$ are $g_{vu}=g_{uv}=1$. Since these are constant, their derivatives are zero. Thus, for any choice of indices $a$ and $c$, the terms $\\partial_{c}g_{va}$ and $\\partial_{a}g_{cv}$ vanish.\nTherefore, $\\Gamma^{b}_{cv}=0$ for all $b, c$. This implies $\\nabla_{c}k^{b}=0$.\nWe have successfully concluded Step 1.\n\n### Step 2: Computation of the Expansion $\\theta$\n\nThe optical tensor is defined as $B_{ab} \\equiv h_{a}{}^{c}h_{b}{}^{d}\\nabla_{c}k_{d}$. The screen projector $h_{ab}$ projects tensors onto the 2-dimensional subspace orthogonal to both $k^{a}$ and the auxiliary null vector $n^{a}$.\nFrom Step 1, we found that the tensor field $\\nabla_{c}k_{d}$ is identically zero.\n$$\\nabla_{c}k_{d} \\;=\\; 0$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of the optical tensor gives:\n$$B_{ab} \\;=\\; h_{a}{}^{c}h_{b}{}^{d}(0) \\;=\\; 0$$\nThe optical tensor is identically zero for this congruence.\n\nThe expansion $\\theta$ is the trace of the symmetric part of $B_{ab}$, specifically $\\theta \\equiv \\frac{1}{2} h^{ab}B_{ab}$. Since $B_{ab}=0$, the expansion is also zero:\n$$\\theta \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2} h^{ab}(0) \\;=\\; 0$$\nThe expansion $\\theta$ is zero at every point in the spacetime for this congruence. Therefore, as a function of the affine parameter $\\lambda=v$ along any geodesic in the congruence, $\\theta(\\lambda)$ is the constant function $0$.\n\n### Step 3: Null Convergence Condition\nThe Null Convergence Condition (NCC) states that $R_{ab}X^{a}X^{b} \\ge 0$ for any null vector $X^a$. We must check this for our null vector $k^{a}$. We need to compute $R_{ab}k^{a}k^{b} = R_{vv}$.\nThe Ricci tensor is $R_{bd} = \\partial_{a}\\Gamma^{a}_{bd} - \\partial_{d}\\Gamma^{a}_{ba} + \\Gamma^{c}_{bd}\\Gamma^{a}_{ca} - \\Gamma^{c}_{ba}\\Gamma^{a}_{cd}$.\nFor the component $R_{vv}$, we have:\n$$R_{vv} \\;=\\; \\partial_{a}\\Gamma^{a}_{vv} - \\partial_{v}\\Gamma^{a}_{va} + \\Gamma^{c}_{vv}\\Gamma^{a}_{ca} - \\Gamma^{c}_{va}\\Gamma^{a}_{cd}$$\nIn Step 1, we established that $\\Gamma^{a}_{vb}=0$ for all $a,b$. This means every Christoffel symbol in the expression for $R_{vv}$ is zero.\n$$\\Gamma^{a}_{vv} = 0, \\quad \\Gamma^{a}_{va} = 0, \\quad \\Gamma^{c}_{vv} = 0, \\quad \\Gamma^{c}_{va}=0$$\nTherefore, every term in the expression for $R_{vv}$ vanishes.\n$$R_{vv} \\;=\\; 0 - 0 + 0 - 0 \\;=\\; 0$$\nSo, for the vector field $k^{a}$, we have $R_{ab}k^{a}k^{b} = R_{vv} = 0$. Since $0 \\ge 0$, the Null Convergence Condition is satisfied.\n\n### Step 4: Explanation for Lack of Focusing\n\nThe Raychaudhuri equation for a null geodesic congruence with tangent vector field $k^a$ is:\n$$\\frac{d\\theta}{d\\lambda} \\;=\\; -\\frac{1}{2}\\theta^{2} \\;-\\; \\sigma_{ab}\\sigma^{ab} \\;+\\; \\omega_{ab}\\omega^{ab} \\;-\\; R_{ab}k^{a}k^{b}$$\nFocusing of a congruence corresponds to $\\theta$ becoming negative, indicating that the cross-sectional area of the congruence is shrinking.\n\nFrom our calculations:\n1. In Step 2, we found that the optical tensor $B_{ab}$ is zero. The expansion $\\theta$, shear $\\sigma_{ab}$, and twist $\\omega_{ab}$ are the trace, trace-free symmetric part, and anti-symmetric part of $B_{ab}$ (up to conventions). Since $B_{ab}=0$, it follows that all three are identically zero:\n   $$\\theta = 0, \\quad \\sigma_{ab} = 0, \\quad \\omega_{ab} = 0$$\n   The congruence is non-expanding, shear-free, and twist-free.\n\n2. In Step 3, we found that the Ricci tensor contracted with $k^a$ is zero:\n   $$R_{ab}k^{a}k^{b} = 0$$\n\nSubstituting these results into the Raychaudhuri equation gives:\n$$\\frac{d(0)}{d\\lambda} \\;=\\; -\\frac{1}{2}(0)^{2} \\;-\\; 0 \\;+\\; 0 \\;-\\; 0$$\n$$0 \\;=\\; 0$$\nThe equation is satisfied trivially. The rate of change of the expansion, $d\\theta/d\\lambda$, is zero. Since the expansion $\\theta$ is already zero everywhere, it remains zero along the geodesics.\nNo focusing occurs because the initial state of the congruence is one of zero expansion, and the \"source\" term for focusing, $R_{ab}k^{a}k^{b}$, is exactly zero. Although the NCC ($R_{ab}k^{a}k^{b} \\ge 0$) is satisfied, it is satisfied minimally ($=0$) and thus provides no driving force to cause the geodesics to converge. The geodesics in this congruence remain parallel, neither converging nor diverging.\n\nThe final answer requested is the expression for the expansion $\\theta(\\lambda)$ from Step 2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3003830"}]}
