However, the intense spacetime curvature and 'frame-dragging' near a rotating black hole create a boundary called the stationary limit surface. Inside this surface, it is physically impossible for any massive object to remain stationary, regardless of its engine power; it is inevitably dragged along by the black hole's rotation.\n\nThe location of this surface is determined by the condition that the time-time component of the spacetime metric, $g_{tt}$, equals zero. For a Kerr black hole, using Boyer-Lindquist coordinates and natural units where the gravitational constant $G=1$ and the speed of light $c=1$, this component is given by:\n$$g_{tt} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2Mr}{r^2 + a^2\\cos^2\\theta}\\right)$$\nwhere $r$ is the radial coordinate from the singularity and $\\theta$ is the polar angle.\n\nYour task is to calculate the Boyer-Lindquist radial coordinate, $r_S$, of the stationary limit surface where it intersects the equatorial plane.
