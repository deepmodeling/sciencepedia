Unlike their non-rotating counterparts, Kerr black holes possess not only an event horizon but also a unique region called the ergosphere, bounded by the static limit surface. This first practice invites you to investigate the special case of an \"extremal\" black hole, spinning at its maximum possible rate, to determine where these two crucial surfaces meet and gain a tangible feel for how rotation sculpts the very fabric of spacetime [@problem_id:1849970].", "problem": "In units where the gravitational constant $G$ and the speed of light $c$ are set to one, a rotating, uncharged black hole is described by the Kerr metric. The spacetime geometry of such an object is uniquely defined by its mass $M$ and its spin parameter $a$. Two key surfaces define its structure: the event horizon and the static limit surface.\n\nThe radius of the outer event horizon, $r_{H}$, which represents the boundary from which nothing can escape, is given by the larger root of the equation $r^2 - 2Mr + a^2 = 0$. This yields $r_{H} = M + \\sqrt{M^2 - a^2}$.\n\nThe static limit surface defines the outer boundary of a region called the ergosphere. Inside this region, all matter is forced to co-rotate with the black hole. The radius of this surface, $r_{S}$, depends on the polar angle $\\theta$ (where $\\theta=0$ represents the axis of rotation) and is given by $r_{S}(\\theta) = M + \\sqrt{M^2 - a^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)}$.\n\nNow, consider an \"extremal\" Kerr black hole, which spins at the maximum possible rate for its mass, corresponding to the case where $a=M$. For this specific type of black hole, the event horizon and the static limit surface are not independent; they touch each other along the axis of rotation.\n\nDetermine the coordinate radius at which these two surfaces make contact. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of the mass $M$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the specific radius where the event horizon and the static limit surface touch for an extremal Kerr black hole. We are given the necessary formulas and the conditions for this scenario.\n\nFirst, let's identify the given information and conditions:\n1.  The radius of the outer event horizon is $r_{H} = M + \\sqrt{M^2 - a^2}$.\n2.  The radius of the static limit surface is $r_{S}(\\theta) = M + \\sqrt{M^2 - a^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)}$.\n3.  The black hole is extremal, which means its spin parameter $a$ is equal to its mass $M$, so $a = M$.\n4.  We are interested in the location where the surfaces touch, which the problem states is along the axis of rotation. The axis of rotation corresponds to polar angles $\\theta = 0$ and $\\theta = \\pi$.\n\nOur strategy is to evaluate the radii of both surfaces under the given conditions and find the value where they are equal.\n\nLet's start by calculating the radius of the event horizon for an extremal black hole. We substitute the condition $a=M$ into the formula for $r_{H}$:\n$$r_{H} = M + \\sqrt{M^2 - M^2}$$\n$$r_{H} = M + \\sqrt{0}$$\n$$r_{H} = M$$\nFor an extremal Kerr black hole, the inner and outer horizons merge into a single event horizon located at a constant coordinate radius of $r=M$.\n\nNext, let's determine the radius of the static limit surface along the axis of rotation. The axis of rotation is defined by $\\theta = 0$ or $\\theta = \\pi$. At these angles, $\\cos(\\theta)$ is either $1$ or $-1$. In either case, $\\cos^2(\\theta) = (\\pm 1)^2 = 1$.\nWe substitute $\\cos^2(\\theta) = 1$ into the formula for $r_{S}(\\theta)$:\n$$r_{S}(\\theta=0 \\text{ or } \\pi) = M + \\sqrt{M^2 - a^2 (1)}$$\n$$r_{S}(\\theta=0 \\text{ or } \\pi) = M + \\sqrt{M^2 - a^2}$$\nThis expression gives the radius of the static limit surface at the poles for any Kerr black hole.\n\nNow, we apply the extremal condition ($a=M$) to this result:\n$$r_{S}(\\theta=0 \\text{ or } \\pi) = M + \\sqrt{M^2 - M^2}$$\n$$r_{S}(\\theta=0 \\text{ or } \\pi) = M + \\sqrt{0}$$\n$$r_{S}(\\theta=0 \\text{ or } \\pi) = M$$\n\nBy comparing the results, we can see that for an extremal black hole, the event horizon radius is $r_{H} = M$ and the radius of the static limit surface along the axis of rotation is also $r_{S} = M$. Therefore, the two surfaces touch at this radius.\n\nThe coordinate radius at which the event horizon and the static limit surface make contact for an extremal Kerr black hole is $M$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{M}$$", "id": "1849970"}, {"introduction": "Having mapped the basic structure, we now turn to the most profound consequence of a black hole's rotation: the dragging of spacetime itself, known as the Lense-Thirring effect or frame-dragging.
