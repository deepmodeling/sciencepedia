A point $p$ on the surface $S$ is called a **singular point** if the gradient of the polynomial, $\\nabla P$, vanishes at that point, i.e., $\\nabla P(p) = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nFor a surface passing through the origin which is a singular point, the local geometry is approximated by its **tangent cone**. The equation of the tangent cone at the origin is determined by the lowest-degree terms of the defining polynomial. Specifically, if one writes the polynomial $P$ as a sum of its homogeneous components,\n$$P(x,y,z) = P_k(x,y,z) + P_{k+1}(x,y,z) + \\dots + P_m(x,y,z)$$\nwhere $P_d(x,y,z)$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $d$ (i.e., $P_d(\\lambda x, \\lambda y, \\lambda z) = \\lambda^d P_d(x,y,z)$) and $P_k$ is the non-zero homogeneous component of minimal degree, then the tangent cone is the surface defined by the equation $P_k(x,y,z)=0$.\n\nA polynomial is called **reduced** if it is square-free, meaning it has no repeated irreducible factors.

The polynomial $y^3+2z^3$ is not divisible by $y$, as substituting $y=0$ gives $2z^3 \\neq 0$. Therefore, $y^2$ and $y^3+2z^3$ are coprime.
