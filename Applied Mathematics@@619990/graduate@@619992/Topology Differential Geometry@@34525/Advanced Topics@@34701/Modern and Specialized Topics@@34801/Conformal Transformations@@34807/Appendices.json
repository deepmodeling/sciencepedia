Let's return to the equation $(d-a)z = b$.\n*   If $a \\neq d$, there is a unique finite fixed point $z = \\frac{b}{d-a}$. In this case, there are two distinct fixed points ($z=\\frac{b}{d-a}$ and $z=\\infty$), so the transformation is hyperbolic or elliptic, but not parabolic.\n*   If $a=d$, the equation becomes $0 \\cdot z = b$.\n    *   If $b=0$, the equation is $0=0$, which is true for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.

The problem statement excludes the identity transformation.\n    *   If $b \\neq 0$, the equation is $0=b$, which has no solution. There are no finite fixed points. The only fixed point is $z=\\infty$. This corresponds to a parabolic transformation (specifically, a translation $f(z) = z + b/d$).\n\nSo, for a non-identity parabolic transformation with $c=0$, we must have $a=d$ and $b \\neq 0$.
