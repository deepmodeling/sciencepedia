[@problem_id:979689]", "problem": "The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model is a paradigmatic example of a one-dimensional topological insulator. It describes a bipartite chain with alternating hopping amplitudes. Its Bloch Hamiltonian in momentum space $k$ can be written in the form $H(k) = \\mathbf{d}(k) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices. For the SSH model, the vector $\\mathbf{d}(k)$ is confined to the $x$-$y$ plane, such that $H(k) = d_x(k)\\sigma_x + d_y(k)\\sigma_y$. This form of the Hamiltonian possesses a chiral symmetry, $\\sigma_z H(k) \\sigma_z = -H(k)$, placing it in the AIII symmetry class. The topological phases of such systems are classified by an integer winding number, $N$.\n\nThe winding number $N$ is defined by the number of times the vector $\\mathbf{d}(k) = (d_x(k), d_y(k))$ winds around the origin of the $d_x$-$d_y$ plane as the momentum $k$ traverses the first Brillouin zone, $k \\in [-\\pi, \\pi]$ (with lattice constant set to $a=1$).\n\nConsider a generalized SSH model where the components of the $\\mathbf{d}$-vector are given by:\n$$ d_x(k) = v + w \\cos(k) $$\n$$ d_y(k) = w \\sin(k) $$\nThe hopping parameters $v$ (intracell) and $w$ (intercell) are controlled by a single dimensionless parameter $\\alpha$ and a characteristic energy scale $t_0 > 0$:\n$$ v = t_0(1+\\alpha) $$\n$$ w = t_0(1-\\alpha) $$\nThe system undergoes a topological phase transition at a critical value of $\\alpha$ where the energy gap closes.

The winding number $N$ corresponds to the number of times the path parameterized by $\\mathbf{d}(k) = (d_x(k), d_y(k))$ for $k \\in [-\\pi, \\pi]$ encircles the origin in the $d_x$-$d_y$ plane.\n\nThe components of the $\\mathbf{d}$-vector are given as:\n$$ d_x(k) = v + w \\cos(k) $$\n$$ d_y(k) = w \\sin(k) $$\nwith $v = t_0(1+\\alpha)$ and $w = t_0(1-\\alpha)$.\n\nWe can identify the geometric nature of the path by rearranging the equations:\n$$ d_x - v = w \\cos(k) $$\n$$ d_y = w \\sin(k) $$\nSquaring and summing these two expressions yields the equation for the path:\n$$ (d_x - v)^2 + d_y^2 = w^2(\\cos^2(k) + \\sin^2(k)) = w^2 $$\nThis is the equation of a circle in the $d_x$-$d_y$ plane. The center of the circle is at $(v, 0)$ and its radius is $|w|$.\n\nA non-zero winding number ($N \\neq 0$) occurs if and only if this circle encloses the origin $(0,0)$. This condition is satisfied if the magnitude of the center's displacement from the origin is less than the radius, which translates to the condition $|v| < |w|$. If $|v| > |w|$, the circle does not enclose the origin, and the winding number is $N=0$. The topological phase transition occurs at $|v|=|w|$, where the path passes through the origin and the winding number is ill-defined. As $k$ increases from $-\\pi$ to $\\pi$, the path traverses the circle in a counter-clockwise direction, meaning that when the origin is enclosed, the winding number is $N=1$.\n\nWe now proceed to calculate the winding number for the initial and final configurations. Note that for the given range $\\alpha \\in [-1/2, 1/2]$, the parameter $w = t_0(1-\\alpha)$ is always positive, so the radius is simply $w$.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial winding number $N_i$ at $\\alpha_i = -1/2$.**\n\nFor the initial state $\\alpha_i = -1/2$:\n$$ v_i = t_0(1 + (-1/2)) = \\frac{1}{2}t_0 $$\n$$ w_i = t_0(1 - (-1/2)) = \\frac{3}{2}t_0 $$\nWe compare the magnitudes of $v_i$ and $w_i$:\n$$ |v_i| = \\frac{1}{2}t_0 $$\n$$ |w_i| = \\frac{3}{2}t_0 $$\nSince $|v_i| < |w_i|$, the condition for a topological phase is met. The path of $\\mathbf{d}(k)$ is a circle of radius $\\frac{3}{2}t_0$ centered at $(\\frac{1}{2}t_0, 0)$, which encloses the origin. Thus, the initial winding number is:\n$$ N_i = 1 $$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the final winding number $N_f$ at $\\alpha_f = 1/2$.**\n\nFor the final state $\\alpha_f = 1/2$:\n$$ v_f = t_0(1 + 1/2) = \\frac{3}{2}t_0 $$\n$$ w_f = t_0(1 - 1/2) = \\frac{1}{2}t_0 $$\nWe compare the magnitudes of $v_f$ and $w_f$:\n$$ |v_f| = \\frac{3}{2}t_0 $$\n$$ |w_f| = \\frac{1}{2}t_0 $$\nHere, $|v_f| > |w_f|$, so the system is in the trivial phase. The path of $\\mathbf{d}(k)$ is a circle of radius $\\frac{1}{2}t_0$ centered at $(\\frac{3}{2}t_0, 0)$. Since the distance of the center from the origin is greater than the radius, the circle does not enclose the origin. The entire path lies in the $d_x > 0$ half-plane. Therefore, the final winding number is:\n$$ N_f = 0 $$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the change in the winding number $\\Delta N$.**\n\nThe change in the winding number is the difference between the final and initial values:\n$$ \\Delta N = N_f - N_i = 0 - 1 = -1 $$\nThis result signifies that the system transitions from a topologically non-trivial phase ($N=1$) to a topologically trivial phase ($N=0$), with a corresponding change of $-1$ in its topological invariant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1}$$", "id": "979689"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of topological invariants, a crucial skill is identifying the boundaries between different topological phases.
