Consider a one-dimensional complex manifold, which can be described locally by a single complex coordinate $z$. Its geometry is entirely determined by a Kähler potential $K(z, \\bar{z})$.\n\nThe essential geometric objects are defined as follows:\n\n1.  **Metric Tensor**: The components of the metric tensor $g$ in the complex coordinate system $(z, \\bar{z})$ are derived from the Kähler potential. The only non-zero covariant component and its complex conjugate are given by:\n    $$g_{z\\bar{z}} = \\frac{\\partial^2 K}{\\partial z \\partial \\bar{z}}$$\n    and $g_{\\bar{z}z} = g_{z\\bar{z}}$.

It is obtained by contracting the Ricci tensor with the inverse metric tensor.

Any non-zero scalar multiple of this is also normal, so we can use the simpler position vector $p$ itself as a normal vector, $N_p \\propto (x_{1p}, y_{1p}, x_{2p}, y_{2p})$.\n\nThe tangent space $T_pS^3$ is the set of all vectors $v=(v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4) \\in \\mathbb{R}^4$ that are orthogonal to the normal vector $N_p$.

The action of $J$ is given by $Jv = (-v_2, v_1, -v_4, v_3)$. For $Jv$ to be in $T_pS^3$, it must also be orthogonal to the normal vector $p$. Let's compute the dot product $(Jv) \\cdot p$:\n$$ (Jv) \\cdot p = (-v_2, v_1, -v_4, v_3) \\cdot (x_{1p}, y_{1p}, x_{2p}, y_{2p}) $$\n$$ (Jv) \\cdot p = -v_2 x_{1p} + v_1 y_{1p} - v_4 x_{2p} + v_3 y_{2p} $$\n\nThe question is whether this expression is always zero, given that $v_1 x_{1p} + v_2 y_{1p} + v_3 x_{2p} + v_4 y_{2p} = 0$. Let's test this with a specific counterexample.\n\nLet's choose a simple point on the sphere, for example $p = (1, 0, 0, 0)$. This point corresponds to $(z_1, z_2) = (1, 0)$ and satisfies $1^2+0^2+0^2+0^2 = 1$.\nAt this point $p=(1,0,0,0)$, the tangent space $T_pS^3$ is defined by the condition $v \\cdot p = 0$:\n$$ v_1(1) + v_2(0) + v_3(0) + v_4(0) = 0 \\implies v_1 = 0 $$\nSo, any vector of the form $v=(0, v_2, v_3, v_4)$ is in $T_pS^3$.\n\nLet's pick a non-zero tangent vector, for instance $v = (0, 1, 0, 0)$. This vector is in $T_pS^3$.\nNow apply the complex structure $J$ to this vector $v$:\n$$ Jv = J(0, 1, 0, 0) = (-1, 0, -0, 0) = (-1, 0, 0, 0) $$\nIs this new vector $Jv$ in the tangent space $T_pS^3$? We check the orthogonality condition with the position vector $p=(1,0,0,0)$:\n$$ (Jv) \\cdot p = (-1, 0, 0, 0) \\cdot (1, 0, 0, 0) = -1 \\neq 0 $$\nSince the dot product is not zero, the vector $Jv$ is not orthogonal to the normal vector at $p$, and therefore $Jv$ is not in the tangent space $T_pS^3$. In fact, $Jv$ is parallel to the normal vector at $p$.\n\nThis single counterexample demonstrates that it is not always true that if $v \\in T_pS^3$, then $Jv \\in T_pS^3$. This immediately proves that statement A is false and statement C is true.\n\nLet's briefly examine the other options to be thorough.\nStatement B is \"for every non-zero tangent vector $v$, $Jv$ is never tangent\". Let's test this.\nConsider the same point $p=(1,0,0,0)$. Let's choose a different tangent vector, $v' = (0, 0, 1, 0)$. This is in $T_pS^3$ because its first component is zero.\nApply $J$ to $v'$:\n$$ Jv' = J(0, 0, 1, 0) = (-0, 0, -0, 1) = (0, 0, 0, 1) $$\nNow, check if $Jv'$ is in $T_pS^3$:\n$$ (Jv') \\cdot p = (0, 0, 0, 1) \\cdot (1, 0, 0, 0) = 0 $$\nThe dot product is zero, so $Jv'$ is in $T_pS^3$. This provides a counterexample to statement B. We found a tangent vector $v'$ such that $Jv'$ is also tangent.\n\nStatement D claims $J$ maps the entire tangent space to the normal space. The normal space at $p$ is the 1-dimensional space spanned by $p$. Our first example showed $J(0,1,0,0) = (-1,0,0,0)$, which is in the normal space at $p=(1,0,0,0)$. However, our second example showed $J(0,0,1,0) = (0,0,0,1)$, which is tangent, not normal. Therefore, statement D is false.\n\nStatement E claims the property holds for points not on the axes. The logic above finds a counterexample at a point on an axis, but does not prove the property holds elsewhere. In fact, the condition for $J(T_p S^3) \\subseteq T_p S^3$ is that $(Jv)\\cdot p = 0$ for all $v$ with $v \\cdot p = 0$. This can be shown to be equivalent to the condition that $p$ and $Jp$ are linearly dependent, which only happens if $p=0$, which is not on the sphere. Thus, the property $J(T_p S^3) = T_p S^3$ never holds for any $p\\in S^3$. So statement E is false.\n\nThe only statement that holds true is C, as we have explicitly constructed a case where a tangent vector is mapped to a non-tangent vector by $J$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1648893"}]}
