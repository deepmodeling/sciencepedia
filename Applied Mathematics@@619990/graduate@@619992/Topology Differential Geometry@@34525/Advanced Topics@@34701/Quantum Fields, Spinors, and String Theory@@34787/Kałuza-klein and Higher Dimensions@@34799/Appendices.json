The gravitational interaction between two static point masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$, is described by a generalization of Newton's law of gravitation. In a space with $d$ spatial dimensions, the gravitational potential energy is given by\n$$V_d(r) = -\\frac{\\Gamma(\\frac{d-2}{2})}{4\\pi^{d/2}} \\frac{G_d (d-2)\\pi m_1 m_2}{r^{d-2}},$$\nwhere $G_d$ is the gravitational constant in $d$ spatial dimensions, and $r$ is the separation distance.

The remaining three spatial dimensions form the space we observe.

This is the method of images.\n\n1.  Derive the full expression for the gravitational potential $V(r)$ between the two masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ in this compactified spacetime. Your derivation should relate the 5D constant $G_5$ (denoted $G_4$ in the formula with $d=4$) to the familiar 4D Newton's constant $G_N$. The final expression for $V(r)$ should only contain $G_N$, $m_1$, $m_2$, $R$, and the separation $r$.\n\n2.
