This problem concerns the small quantum cohomology ring of the complex projective line, $\\mathbb{CP}^1$.\n\n**Background:**\n\n1.  The classical cohomology ring of $\\mathbb{CP}^1$ with complex coefficients is given by $H^*(\\mathbb{CP}^1, \\mathbb{C}) \\cong \\mathbb{C}[H] / \\langle H^2 \\rangle$. Here, $H$ is the hyperplane class, which is the generator of $H^2(\\mathbb{CP}^1, \\mathbb{C})$ and has degree $\\deg(H)=1$. The identity element $1$ generates $H^0(\\mathbb{CP}^1, \\mathbb{C})$ and has degree $\\deg(1)=0$. The classical product, the cup product $ \\cup $, satisfies $H \\cup H = 0$.\n\n2.  The small quantum cohomology ring, $QH^*(\\mathbb{CP}^1)$, is a deformation of the classical ring, where the ring multiplication, called the quantum product $ * $, is modified by \"quantum corrections.\" For any two classes $\\alpha, \\beta \\in H^*(\\mathbb{CP}^1, \\mathbb{C})$, their quantum product is defined by:\n    $$ \\alpha * \\beta = \\sum_{d=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{\\gamma \\in \\{1,H\\}} \\langle \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma^{\\vee} \\rangle_{0,3,d} \\, t^d \\, \\gamma $$\n    Here, $t$ is a formal deformation parameter, $d$ is a non-negative integer representing the degree of a rational curve, and $\\{1,H\\}$ is a basis for $H^*(\\mathbb{CP}^1, \\mathbb{C})$. The class $\\gamma^{\\vee}$ is the Poincaré dual of $\\gamma$ under the intersection pairing $\\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^1} a \\cup b$. For the basis $\\{1, H\\}$, the duality relations are given by $1^{\\vee} = H$ and $H^{\\vee} = 1$.\n\n3.  The structure constants $\\langle \\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3 \\rangle_{0,3,d}$ are genus-zero, three-point Gromov-Witten invariants. They can be computed using the following rules:\n    a. **Selection Rule:** The invariant $\\langle \\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3 \\rangle_{0,3,d}$ can be non-zero only if the sum of the degrees of the cohomology classes satisfies the condition $\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\deg(\\alpha_i) = 1 + 2d$.\n    b. **Classical Limit ($d=0$):** For degree $d=0$, the invariant is the classical triple-product integral: $\\langle \\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3 \\rangle_{0,3,0} = \\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^1} \\alpha_1 \\cup \\alpha_2 \\cup \\alpha_3$.\n    c. **A specific invariant value:** For this calculation on $\\mathbb{CP}^1$, the relevant Gromov-Witten invariant is $\\langle H, H, H \\rangle_{0,3,1} = 1$. Unlike analogous invariants on higher-dimensional spaces, this does not have a simple geometric interpretation of \"counting curves through points\" but is a fundamental constant of the theory.\n\n**Problem:**\n\nUsing the definitions and rules provided, derive the expression for the quantum product $H * H$ in the small quantum cohomology ring $QH^*(\\mathbb{CP}^1)$.
