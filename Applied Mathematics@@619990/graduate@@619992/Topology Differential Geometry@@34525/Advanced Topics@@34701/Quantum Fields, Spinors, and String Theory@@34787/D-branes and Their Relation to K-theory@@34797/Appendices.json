Its worldvolume theory includes a U(1) gauge field $A$, with field strength $F=dA$. The quantum consistency of this theory is sensitive to background fields present in the 10-dimensional spacetime, such as the Neveu-Schwarz B-field, a 2-form. The coupling of the gauge field to the B-field is captured by an effective field strength, $\\mathcal{F} = F - i^*B$, where $i^*B$ denotes the pullback of the B-field to the D-brane's worldvolume.\n\nA fundamental principle, generalizing the Dirac quantization condition for magnetic monopoles, dictates that the flux of this effective field strength $\\mathcal{F}$ must be integrally quantized over any closed 2-dimensional submanifold (a 2-cycle) $\\Sigma$ within the worldvolume.

A key implication is that the flux of the gauge field strength $F$ alone is not necessarily an integer, as it might need to compensate for a non-integral B-field flux.
