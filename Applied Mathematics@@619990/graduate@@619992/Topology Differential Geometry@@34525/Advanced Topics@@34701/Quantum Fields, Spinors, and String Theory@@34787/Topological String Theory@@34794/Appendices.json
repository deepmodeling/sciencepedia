This ring is a deformation of the classical cohomology ring.\n\nLet $H$ be the generator of the second cohomology group $H^2(\\mathbb{P}^1, \\mathbb{C})$, normalized such that its integral over $\\mathbb{P}^1$ is one. Let $1$ be the generator of $H^0(\\mathbb{P}^1, \\mathbb{C})$. The basis of the cohomology vector space is $\\{1, H\\}$. The quantum product, denoted by $\\ast$, is defined on this basis.

This is a commutative ring formed by polynomial operators in the chiral fields, subject to relations imposed by the dynamics of the theory. Mathematically, the chiral ring is defined as the quotient of the polynomial ring $\\mathbb{C}[z_1, \\dots, z_k]$ by the ideal $J$ generated by all partial derivatives of the superpotential.

The parameter $n$ is a positive integer.\n\nThe chiral ring is defined as the quotient ring:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}_B = \\frac{\\mathbb{C}[x, y]}{J}\n$$\nwhere $J$ is the Jacobian ideal generated by the partial derivatives of $W$.\n\nFirst, we compute the partial derivatives of the superpotential $W(x, y)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (x^{n+1} + y^2) = (n+1)x^n\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (x^{n+1} + y^2) = 2y\n$$\n\nThe ideal $J$ is therefore generated by these two polynomials:\n$$\nJ = \\left\\langle (n+1)x^n, 2y \\right\\rangle\n$$\nSince we are working over the field of complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$, the non-zero constant factors $(n+1)$ and $2$ are units in the ring of polynomials. This means they do not affect the ideal generated. For instance, any multiple of $(n+1)x^n$ is also a multiple of $x^n$, and vice-versa.

To find this dimension, we need to find a basis of monomials for the quotient ring.\n\nThe elements of the quotient ring are equivalence classes of polynomials in $\\mathbb{C}[x, y]$. The relations imposed by the ideal are $x^n=0$ and $y=0$. Let $P(x, y)$ be an arbitrary polynomial in $\\mathbb{C}[x, y]$. We can write it as a sum of monomials:\n$$\nP(x, y) = \\sum_{i, j \\ge 0} c_{ij} x^i y^j\n$$\nwhere $c_{ij}$ are complex coefficients.\n\nNow we apply the relations from the ideal $J$:\n1.

Specifically, for any $j \\ge 1$, $x^i y^j = x^i y^{j-1} \\cdot y \\equiv x^i y^{j-1} \\cdot 0 = 0$. This means all terms with $j \\ge 1$ vanish. The polynomial $P(x,y)$ is equivalent to:\n    $$\n    P(x, y) \\equiv \\sum_{i \\ge 0} c_{i0} x^i \\pmod J\n    $$\n    This reduces the problem to considering polynomials in $x$ only, effectively working in the ring $\\mathbb{C}[x]/\\langle x^n \\rangle$.\n\n2.  The relation $x^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{J}$ implies that any term containing a factor of $x^n$ or higher powers of $x$ is zero in the quotient ring. For any $i \\ge n$, we can write $x^i = x^{i-n} \\cdot x^n \\equiv x^{i-n} \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n    This means that in the sum $\\sum_{i \\ge 0} c_{i0} x^i$, all terms with $i \\ge n$ vanish.\n    So, any polynomial $P(x, y)$ is equivalent to a polynomial of the form:\n    $$\n    P(x, y) \\equiv c_{00} + c_{10}x + c_{20}x^2 + \\dots + c_{n-1,0}x^{n-1} \\pmod J\n    $$\nThis shows that any element in the quotient ring $\\mathcal{R}_B$ can be represented as a linear combination of the monomials $\\{1, x, x^2, \\dots, x^{n-1}\\}$. These monomials span the vector space $\\mathcal{R}_B$.\n\nTo form a basis, these spanning monomials must also be linearly independent. A linear combination $\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k x^k$ is zero in $\\mathcal{R}_B$ if and only if the polynomial $\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k x^k$ is an element of the ideal $J = \\langle x^n, y \\rangle$. This means $\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k x^k = A(x,y)x^n + B(x,y)y$ for some polynomials $A(x,y)$ and $B(x,y)$. Setting $y=0$, we get $\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k x^k = A(x,0)x^n$. The polynomial on the left has degree at most $n-1$, while the polynomial on the right is either the zero polynomial or has degree at least $n$. This equality can only hold if both sides are the zero polynomial. This implies that all coefficients $a_k$ must be zero. Therefore, the monomials $\\{1, x, x^2, \\dots, x^{n-1}\\}$ are linearly independent.\n\nSince the set $\\{1, x, x^2, \\dots, x^{n-1}\\}$ is a basis for $\\mathcal{R}_B$ as a vector space over $\\mathbb{C}$, the dimension of $\\mathcal{R}_B$ is the number of elements in this basis.\n$$\n\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(\\mathcal{R}_B) = |\\{1, x, x^2, \\dots, x^{n-1}\\}|\n$$\nThe number of elements in this set is $(n-1) - 0 + 1 = n$.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the chiral ring for the $A_n$ singularity is $n$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{n}\n$$", "id": "1079468"}, {"introduction": "Many partition functions in topological string theory can be exactly computed as integrals over spaces of matrices, a profound connection that underpins non-perturbative formulations of the theory.
