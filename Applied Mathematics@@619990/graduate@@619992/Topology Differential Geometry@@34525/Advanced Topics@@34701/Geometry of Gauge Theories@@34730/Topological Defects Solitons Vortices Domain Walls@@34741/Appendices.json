When a symmetry of the system is broken, the ground state may not be unique, leading to a \"vacuum manifold\" of degenerate states. This exercise explores a realistic scenario where a hierarchy of symmetry-breaking terms carves out a specific set of preferred vacua, which are then slightly perturbed. By calculating the resulting energy splitting, you will gain hands-on experience with the mechanism that gives rise to the distinct ground states between which domain walls can form.

This can be expressed as $\\lambda v^4 \\gg \\epsilon_1 v^{N_1} \\gg \\epsilon_2 v^{N_2} > 0$.\n\nDue to this hierarchy, the vacuum states of the theory are primarily determined by the minimization of $V_0 + V_1$. The term $V_0$ forces the vacuum expectation value of the field to have a magnitude close to $v$. The term $V_1$ then selects a discrete set of preferred phases, creating a set of degenerate vacuum states. The smallest term, $V_2$, acts as a perturbation, lifting the degeneracy of these vacua.\n\nAssume that the vacuum expectation values of the field lie on the circle $|\\phi| = v$.
