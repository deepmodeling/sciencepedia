At time $t=0$, the vacuum state is defined by filling all available single-particle states with negative energy. States with positive energy are left empty. As time evolves, the background electric field can cause energy levels to shift. If a state that was initially in the filled Dirac sea (negative energy) evolves to have positive energy, it becomes an empty state above the sea. This process corresponds to the creation of a fermion-antifermion pair: the fermion occupies the newly available positive energy state, and the hole left in the sea is the\nantiparticle.\n\nThe rate of fermion production is therefore equal to the net rate at which energy levels cross from negative to positive values.\n\nYour task is to calculate the rate of fermion-antifermion pair production per unit spatial length.
