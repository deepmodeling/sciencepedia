The standard projection from a higher-dimensional Euclidean space to a lower-dimensional one, e.g., $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$, is generally not a closed map.\n\nConsider the surface $S$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ defined by the relation $z^2(x^2+y^2 - a^2) = 1$, where $a$ is a positive real parameter. This surface is a hyperboloid of revolution. Let $C$ be a subset of $S$ defined by the additional constraint $|z| \\ge z_0$, where $z_0$ is a positive constant.

The image of the closed set $C$ under this projection, $\\pi(C)$, is a region in the $xy$-plane that is not closed.\n\nYour task is to derive the area of this region $\\pi(C)$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the area of the projection of a constrained subset of a surface onto the $xy$-plane.\n\n1.  **Analyze the surface and the constraints.**\n    The surface $S$ is defined by the equation $z^2(x^2+y^2 - a^2) = 1$.\n    For $z$ to be a real number, the term $x^2+y^2 - a^2$ must be positive, since $z^2$ is non-negative. If $x^2+y^2-a^2=0$, the equation leads to a contradiction $0=1$. Thus, we must have $x^2+y^2 - a^2  0$.\n    This can be rearranged to express $z^2$ or $x^2+y^2$:\n    $$z^2 = \\frac{1}{x^2+y^2 - a^2}$$\n    or\n    $$x^2+y^2 - a^2 = \\frac{1}{z^2}$$\n    The subset $C$ of $S$ is defined by the additional constraint $|z| \\ge z_0$, where $z_0  0$.\n\n2.  **Determine the region of projection.**\n    The projection $\\pi(C)$ is the set of points $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ for which there exists a $z$ such that $(x,y,z) \\in C$.\n    Let's combine the surface equation with the constraint on $z$.\n    The constraint is $|z| \\ge z_0$. Squaring both sides gives $z^2 \\ge z_0^2$.\n    Since $z_0  0$, we have $z^2  0$ and $z_0^2  0$. Taking the reciprocal of the inequality reverses the direction:\n    $$0  \\frac{1}{z^2} \\le \\frac{1}{z_0^2}$$\n    The strict inequality $0  1/z^2$ holds because $z$ must be finite for any point on the surface.\n    Now, we substitute the expression from the surface equation, $x^2+y^2 - a^2 = \\frac{1}{z^2}$:\n    $$0  x^2+y^2 - a^2 \\le \\frac{1}{z_0^2}$$\n    This double inequality defines the set of points $(x,y)$ that constitute the projection $\\pi(C)$.\n\n3.  **Characterize the geometry of the projected region.**\n    Let's analyze the inequality: $0  x^2+y^2 - a^2 \\le \\frac{1}{z_0^2}$.\n    We can split this into two parts:\n    i) $x^2+y^2 - a^2  0 \\implies x^2+y^2  a^2$. This describes the region outside a circle of radius $a$.\n    ii) $x^2+y^2 - a^2 \\le \\frac{1}{z_0^2} \\implies x^2+y^2 \\le a^2 + \\frac{1}{z_0^2}$. This describes the region inside or on a circle of radius $\\sqrt{a^2 + \\frac{1}{z_0^2}}$.\n\n    Combining these two conditions, we get:\n    $$a^2  x^2+y^2 \\le a^2 + \\frac{1}{z_0^2}$$\n    This inequality describes an annulus (a ring-shaped region) in the $xy$-plane. The inner boundary circle is $x^2+y^2 = a^2$, and the outer boundary circle is $x^2+y^2 = a^2 + \\frac{1}{z_0^2}$. The region does not include the inner boundary but includes the outer boundary, which is why the set $\\pi(C)$ is not closed.\n\n4.  **Calculate the area of the annulus.**\n    The area of an annulus is the area of the outer disk minus the area of the inner disk.\n    Let $R_{out}$ be the outer radius and $R_{in}$ be the inner radius.\n    From the inequality $a^2  x^2+y^2 \\le a^2 + \\frac{1}{z_0^2}$, we identify the squares of the radii:\n    $$R_{in}^2 = a^2$$\n    $$R_{out}^2 = a^2 + \\frac{1}{z_0^2}$$\n    The area, $A$, is given by:\n    $$A = \\pi R_{out}^2 - \\pi R_{in}^2$$\n    Substituting the expressions for the squared radii:\n    $$A = \\pi \\left(a^2 + \\frac{1}{z_0^2}\\right) - \\pi a^2$$\n    $$A = \\pi a^2 + \\frac{\\pi}{z_0^2} - \\pi a^2$$\n    $$A = \\frac{\\pi}{z_0^2}$$\n    The parameter $a$ cancels out.
