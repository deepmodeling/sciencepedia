{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "This exercise provides a foundational practice in constructing a topology from the ground up. By starting with a subbasis defined by the edges of a complete graph, you will trace the entire process of generating a basis and the corresponding topology on a finite set of vertices. This concrete, combinatorial setting is perfect for solidifying the definitions and understanding the crucial concept of a minimal basis, which is the most efficient description of a topological structure [@problem_id:917839].", "problem": "Let $V$ be the set of vertices of the complete graph $K_5$. A topology $\\mathcal{T}$ on the set $V$ is generated by a subbasis $\\mathcal{S}$, where $\\mathcal{S}$ is the set of all edges of $K_5$. An edge is defined as a 2-element subset of $V$.\n\nRecall the following definitions:\n1.  The basis $\\mathcal{B}$ generated by a subbasis $\\mathcal{S}$ is the collection of all possible finite intersections of elements of $\\mathcal{S}$. By convention, the intersection of an empty collection of subsets is the entire space $V$.\n2.  The topology $\\mathcal{T}$ generated by a basis $\\mathcal{B}$ consists of all possible unions of elements of $\\mathcal{B}$.\n3.  A basis $\\mathcal{B}$ for a topology $\\mathcal{T}$ is called *minimal* if no proper subset of $\\mathcal{B}$ is also a basis for $\\mathcal{T}$.\n\nDerive the cardinality of a minimal basis for the topology $\\mathcal{T}$.", "solution": "1. The subbasis is:\n   $$\\mathcal S=\\{\\{i,j\\}:1\\le i<j\\le5\\},$$ \n   so $|\\mathcal S|=\\binom{5}{2}=10.$\n2. The basis $\\mathcal B$ consists of all finite intersections of elements of $\\mathcal S$.  The only nonempty intersections of two distinct edges are singletons or empty:\n   - Intersection of no edges: $V$, one set.\n   - Intersection of one edge: that edge, $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ sets.\n   - Intersection of two edges: either a singleton (if they meet) or $\\emptyset$.  There are $5$ singletons and one $\\emptyset$ in $\\mathcal B$.\n   Hence \n   $$\\mathcal B=\\{V,\\emptyset\\}\\cup\\{\\text{10 edges}\\}\\cup\\{\\text{5 singletons}\\},$$ \n   and $|\\mathcal B|=1+1+10+5=17.$\n3. Since each singleton $\\{v\\}$ lies in $\\mathcal B$, any subset of $V$ is a union of singletons, so the generated topology $\\mathcal T$ is the discrete topology $\\mathcal P(V)$.\n4. In the discrete topology a basis must contain all singletons and no proper subset of those singletons can generate all open sets.
