A topological space $(X, \\mathcal{T})$ is called a **T1 space** if, for every pair of distinct points $x, y \\in X$, there exists an open set containing $x$ but not $y$. A key equivalent characterization of a T1 space is that for every point $x \\in X$, the singleton set $\\{x\\}$ is a closed set.
