In particular, for each $x \\in X$, the singleton $\\{x\\}$ is open.\n\nFirst-countable: Fix $x \\in X$. Consider the collection $\\mathcal{B}_{x}=\\{\\{x\\}\\}$. This collection is countable (indeed finite) and forms a local base at $x$, because if $U$ is any open set with $x \\in U$, then $\\{x\\} \\subseteq U$. Therefore, the space is first-countable.\n\nSecond-countable: Suppose for contradiction that there exists a countable base $\\mathcal{B}$ for the topology.

Thus, $(x,y) \\in A$ if and only if there exist $\\epsilon>0, \\delta>0$ such that for all $(u,v) \\in [x, x+\\epsilon) \\times [y, y+\\delta)$, the inequality $u^2+v^2 \\le 1$ holds.\n\nWe can split the analysis into two parts: points inside the open disk and points on its boundary.\n\n1.  **Points in the open disk**\n    Let $D^o = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x^2+y^2 < 1\\}$ be the standard open unit disk. The standard topology on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is coarser than the Sorgenfrey topology on $\\mathbb{R}_l^2$. This means every set that is open in the standard topology is also open in the Sorgenfrey topology. Since $D^o$ is open in the standard topology and $D^o \\subseteq D$, it follows that $D^o$ is an open set in $\\mathbb{R}_l^2$ contained in $D$. By the definition of the interior as the largest open set contained in $D$, we must have $D^o \\subseteq A$.\n\n2.  **Points on the boundary circle**\n    Let's consider a point $(x,y)$ on the boundary of the disk, i.e., $x^2+y^2=1$. For $(x,y)$ to be in $A$, there must exist $\\epsilon>0, \\delta>0$ such that for every point $(u,v) \\in [x, x+\\epsilon) \\times [y, y+\\delta)$, we have $u^2+v^2 \\le 1$.\n    Let $u = x+s\\epsilon$ and $v = y+t\\delta$, where $s,t \\in [0,1)$. The condition $u^2+v^2 \\le 1$ becomes:\n    $$\n    (x+s\\epsilon)^2 + (y+t\\delta)^2 \\le 1\n    $$\n    Expanding this and using $x^2+y^2=1$:\n    $$\n    x^2 + 2xs\\epsilon + s^2\\epsilon^2 + y^2 + 2yt\\delta + t^2\\delta^2 \\le 1\n    $$\n    $$\n    1 + 2xs\\epsilon + s^2\\epsilon^2 + 2yt\\delta + t^2\\delta^2 \\le 1\n    $$\n    This simplifies to the condition that for some $\\epsilon>0, \\delta>0$, the following inequality must hold for all $s, t \\in [0,1)$:\n    $$\n    2xs\\epsilon + s^2\\epsilon^2 + 2yt\\delta + t^2\\delta^2 \\le 0\n    $$\n    Let's analyze this condition based on the signs of $x$ and $y$.\n    -   If $x>0$: Choose any $s \\in (0,1)$ and $t=0$. The inequality becomes $2xs\\epsilon + s^2\\epsilon^2 \\le 0$. Since $x,s,\\epsilon$ are all positive, $2xs\\epsilon + s^2\\epsilon^2 > 0$. The condition fails. So, no point $(x,y)$ on the boundary circle with $x>0$ can be in $A$.\n    -   If $y>0$: Similarly, choose $s=0$ and any $t \\in (0,1)$. The inequality becomes $2yt\\delta + t^2\\delta^2 \\le 0$. Since $y,t,\\delta$ are all positive, this is impossible. So, no point $(x,y)$ on the boundary circle with $y>0$ can be in $A$.\n\n    This means we only need to consider points $(x,y)$ on the circle where $x \\le 0$ and $y \\le 0$. This corresponds to the arc of the circle in the third quadrant, including its endpoints $(-1,0)$ and $(0,-1)$.\n\n    -   If $x<0$ and $y<0$: In this case, $2xs\\epsilon \\le 0$ and $2yt\\delta \\le 0$ for all $s, t \\in [0,1)$. We need to check if we can absorb the positive quadratic terms.\n        The condition is $s\\epsilon(2x + s\\epsilon) + t\\delta(2y + t\\delta) \\le 0$.\n        For $s \\in [0,1)$, we have $s\\epsilon  \\epsilon$. If we choose $\\epsilon$ small enough, specifically $\\epsilon  -2x = 2|x|$, then $s\\epsilon  2|x|$. This ensures that $2x+s\\epsilon  0$. The first term $s\\epsilon(2x+s\\epsilon)$ is thus non-positive.\n        Similarly, if we choose $\\delta  2|y|$, the second term $t\\delta(2y+t\\delta)$ is non-positive.\n        The sum of two non-positive numbers is non-positive. Thus, for any point $(x,y)$ on the circle with $x0$ and $y0$, we can find suitable $\\epsilon, \\delta  0$. For instance, picking any $\\epsilon \\in (0, 2|x|)$ and $\\delta \\in (0, 2|y|)$ works. So, all such points are in $A$.\n\n    -   If $x=-1, y=0$: The condition is $s(-2\\epsilon + s\\epsilon^2) + t^2\\delta^2 \\le 0$ for all $s,t \\in [0,1)$.\n        This inequality can be written as $t^2\\delta^2 \\le s\\epsilon(2-s\\epsilon)$.\n        For any choice of $\\epsilon, \\delta  0$, this must hold for *all* $s,t \\in [0,1)$.\n        If we take $s=0$, the inequality requires $t^2\\delta^2 \\le 0$. For this to hold for all $t \\in [0,1)$, we must have $\\delta=0$, which contradicts $\\delta0$. Thus, the point $(-1,0)$ is not in $A$.\n\n    -   If $x=0, y=-1$: By symmetry with the previous case, the point $(0,-1)$ is not in $A$. The condition becomes $s^2\\epsilon^2 + t(-2\\delta+t\\delta^2) \\le 0$, which fails for $t=0$.\n\n3.  **Conclusion for the set A**\n    Combining our findings, the set $A$ consists of the open disk $D^o$ plus the part of the boundary circle in the open third quadrant.\n    $$\n    A = \\{(x,y) \\mid x^2+y^2  1\\} \\cup \\{(x,y) \\mid x^2+y^2=1, x0, y0\\}\n    $$\n\n4.  **Calculating the Area**\n    The area of $A$ is its two-dimensional Lebesgue measure $\\lambda_2(A)$. The measure of a union is the sum of the measures of the disjoint parts.\n    $$\n    \\lambda_2(A) = \\lambda_2( \\{(x,y) \\mid x^2+y^2  1\\} ) + \\lambda_2( \\{(x,y) \\mid x^2+y^2=1, x0, y0\\} )\n    $$\n    The first term is the area of the open unit disk, which is $\\pi r^2$ with $r=1$, so it is $\\pi$.\n    The second term is the measure of a curve (an arc of a circle) in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.
