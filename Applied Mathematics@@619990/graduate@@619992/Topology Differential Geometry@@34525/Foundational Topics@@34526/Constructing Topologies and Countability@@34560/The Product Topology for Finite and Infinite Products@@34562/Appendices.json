Let $x = 1/13$. We compute $27x$:\n$$27x = 27 \\times \\frac{1}{13} = \\frac{27}{13} = \\frac{26+1}{13} = 2 + \\frac{1}{13} = 2 + x$$\nLet the ternary expansion of $x$ be $x = (0.a_1a_2a_3\\dots)_3 = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{a_k}{3^k}$.\nMultiplying by $27=3^3$ shifts the ternary point three places to the left:\n$$27x = (a_1a_2a_3.a_4a_5a_6\\dots)_3 = (a_1 \\cdot 3^2 + a_2 \\cdot 3^1 + a_3 \\cdot 3^0) + (0.a_4a_5a_6\\dots)_3$$\nComparing the two expressions for $27x$, we can equate the integer and fractional parts. The fractional part of $27x$ is $x$, which implies that the sequence of digits is periodic with period 3:\n$$(0.a_4a_5a_6\\dots)_3 = (0.a_1a_2a_3\\dots)_3 \\implies a_{k+3} = a_k \\text{ for all } k \\ge 1$$\nThe integer part of $27x$ is 2:\n$$9a_1 + 3a_2 + a_3 = 2$$\nSince $x$ is in the Cantor set $C$, its digits $a_k$ must belong to the set $\\{0, 2\\}$. We can solve for $a_1, a_2, a_3$:\n- If $a_1=2$, then $9a_1=18$, which is greater than 2. Thus, $a_1=0$.\n- The equation becomes $3a_2 + a_3 = 2$. If $a_2=2$, then $3a_2=6$, which is greater than 2. Thus, $a_2=0$.\n- The equation becomes $a_3 = 2$.\nSo, the repeating block of digits is $(a_1, a_2, a_3) = (0, 0, 2)$. The ternary expansion of $x = 1/13$ is:\n$$x = (0.\\overline{002})_3$$\nThe sequence of digits is $(a_k)_{k \\ge 1} = (0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, \\dots)$. This confirms $x \\in C$. A general formula for the digits is $a_k=2$ if $k$ is a multiple of 3, and $a_k=0$ otherwise.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the ternary expansion of the first coordinate $y$.**\n\nThe first coordinate $y$ of $f(x)$ is given by $y = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{b_k}{3^k}$, where the digits $b_k$ are the odd-indexed digits of $x$, i.e., $b_k = a_{2k-1}$.\nWe use the formula for $a_k$ to find $b_k$:\n$$b_k = a_{2k-1} = \\begin{cases} 2 & \\text{if } 2k-1 \\text{ is a multiple of 3} \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\nWe analyze the condition that $2k-1$ is a multiple of 3 in terms of modular arithmetic:\n$$2k-1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$$\n$$2k \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$$\nMultiplying by 2 (which is the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 3, since $2 \\times 2 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$):\n$$4k \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$$\n$$k \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$$\nSo, the digit $b_k$ is 2 if $k \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$, and 0 otherwise. The sequence of digits for $y$ is:\n$$(b_k)_{k \\ge 1} = (b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, b_5, b_6, \\dots) = (0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, \\dots)$$\nThe ternary expansion of $y$ is therefore $y = (0.\\overline{020})_3$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the numerical value of $y$.**\n\nWe convert the repeating ternary expansion of $y$ into a fraction.\n$$y = (0.020020\\dots)_3 = \\frac{0}{3^1} + \\frac{2}{3^2} + \\frac{0}{3^3} + \\frac{0}{3^4} + \\frac{2}{3^5} + \\frac{0}{3^6} + \\dots$$\nThis can be written as an infinite series:\n$$y = \\frac{2}{3^2} + \\frac{2}{3^5} + \\frac{2}{3^8} + \\dots = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2}{3^{3j+2}}$$\nThis is a geometric series.
