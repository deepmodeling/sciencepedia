This practice [@problem_id:1013353] offers a hands-on opportunity to calculate this important value, $\\delta_L$, and builds intuition for its critical role in analysis.", "problem": "In topology, the Lebesgue number lemma is a crucial result for compact metric spaces. It states that for any open cover of a compact metric space, there exists a specific positive real number, known as the Lebesgue number, that provides a measure of how \"fine\" the cover is.\n\n**Theoretical Background:**\nLet $(X, d)$ be a compact metric space, and let $\\mathcal{U} = \\{U_\\alpha\\}_{\\alpha \\in A}$ be an open cover of $X$. A positive real number $\\delta$ is called a Lebesgue number for the cover $\\mathcal{U}$ if for every subset $S \\subseteq X$ with a diameter less than $\\delta$, there exists an open set $U_\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{U}$ such that $S \\subseteq U_\\alpha$. The diameter of a non-empty set $S$ is defined as $\\text{diam}(S) = \\sup \\{d(x,y) \\mid x,y \\in S\\}$. The Lebesgue number for a cover, denoted as $\\delta_L$, is the supremum of all such valid numbers $\\delta$.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nConsider the compact metric space $X = [0, 1]$ equipped with the standard Euclidean metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$. This space is covered by the open cover $\\mathcal{U} = \\{U_1, U_2\\}$, where $U_1 = (-0.1, 0.6)$ and $U_2 = (0.4, 1.1)$.\n\nCalculate the Lebesgue number $\\delta_L$ for this specific cover $\\mathcal{U}$ of $X$.", "solution": "A Lebesgue number $\\delta > 0$ for the cover $\\mathcal{U}$ is a number such that any subset $S \\subseteq X$ with $\\text{diam}(S)  \\delta$ is contained in some member of $\\mathcal{U}$.\n\nFor the given cover $\\{U_1, U_2\\}$, a subset $S$ fails to be contained in a single member only if it contains points from both $X \\setminus U_1 = [0.6, 1]$ and $X \\setminus U_2 = [0, 0.4]$. The minimum distance between these two disjoint sets is $0.6 - 0.4 = 0.2$. Therefore, any set $S$ that bridges this \"gap\" must have a diameter of at least 0.2.\n\nThis implies that if $\\text{diam}(S)  0.2$, $S$ cannot bridge the gap, so it must be fully contained in either $U_1$ or $U_2$. Thus, any $\\delta \\le 0.2$ is a Lebesgue number.\n\nThe supremum of these numbers is $\\delta_L = 0.2$. We can verify this, as any $\\delta > 0.2$ would fail for the set $S=\\{0.4, 0.6\\}$ (which has $\\text{diam}(S)=0.2  \\delta$, but is not fully in $U_1$ or $U_2$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}$$", "id": "1013353"}, {"introduction": "Having explored intrinsic properties of compact sets, we can elevate our perspective and ask how to measure the \"distance\" between two such sets.
