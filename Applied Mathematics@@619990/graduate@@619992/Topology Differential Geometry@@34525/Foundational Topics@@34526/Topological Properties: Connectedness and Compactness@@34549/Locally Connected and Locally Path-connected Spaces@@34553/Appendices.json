Recall that a space is path-connected if for any two points $a,b$ in the space there exists a continuous map $\\gamma:[0,1]\\to X$ with $\\gamma(0)=a$ and $\\gamma(1)=b$. Take $a\\in(0,1)$ and $b\\in(2,3)$. Suppose, for contradiction, there exists a continuous $\\gamma:[0,1]\\to X$ with $\\gamma(0)=a$ and $\\gamma(1)=b$. Since $[0,1]$ is connected and the continuous image of a connected space is connected, $\\gamma([0,1])$ is connected in $\\mathbb{R}$. In $\\mathbb{R}$, connected subsets are precisely intervals. Therefore $\\gamma([0,1])$ is an interval in $\\mathbb{R}$ containing both $a$ and $b$, hence it must contain every real number between $a$ and $b$, in particular some point of $[1,2]$. But $[1,2]\\cap X=\\varnothing$, so $\\gamma([0,1])\\not\\subset X$, a contradiction. Therefore no such path exists, and $X$ is not path-connected.\n\nSecond, we show $X$ is locally path-connected. A space is locally path-connected if for every point $x$ and every neighborhood $U$ of $x$, there exists a path-connected neighborhood $V$ of $x$ with $V\\subset U$. Fix $x\\in X$. Then either $x\\in(0,1)$ or $x\\in(2,3)$. In either case, since these are open intervals in $\\mathbb{R}$, there exists $r>0$ such that $(x-r,x+r)\\subset X$. Let $U$ be any neighborhood of $x$ in $X$. Because $U$ is open in the subspace topology, there exists an open set $W\\subset \\mathbb{R}$ with $x\\in W$ and $U=W\\cap X$. Choose $0<\\varepsilon<r$ small enough that $(x-\\varepsilon,x+\\varepsilon)\\subset W$. Define\n$$\nV=(x-\\varepsilon,x+\\varepsilon),\n$$\nwhich satisfies $x\\in V\\subset W$ and $V\\subset X$; hence $V\\subset U$. The set $V$ is an open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$, thus path-connected: for any $p,q\\in V$, the map $\\gamma(t)=(1-t)p+tq$ for $t\\in[0,1]$ is continuous and satisfies $\\gamma([0,1])\\subset V$. Therefore each point of $X$ has a neighborhood basis of path-connected sets, so $X$ is locally path-connected.\n\nCombining these, $X$ is not path-connected but is locally path-connected.

Analyze the topological structure of the space $X$.**\nThe space $X$ is the unit square with a set of vertical line segments removed. The $x$-coordinates of these removed segments form the Cantor set $C$. The region $R_{upper} = [0,1] \\times [h, 1]$ is partitioned by the \"tines\" of the comb $W$. The region $R_{lower} = [0,1] \\times [0, h)$ is a standard open rectangle, which is path-connected. Communication between different \"channels\" in $R_{upper}$ can only happen by passing through $R_{lower}$.\n\n**2. Determine the feasibility of a path in the upper region.**\nLet's consider a hypothetical continuous path $\\gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t))$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ connecting $P_0$ to $P_1$ that lies entirely in the upper region, i.e., $y(t) \\geq h$ for all $t$.\nFor such a path to be in $X$, for any $t$, if $x(t) \\in C$, we must have $y(t) < h$. This contradicts the assumption that $y(t) \\geq h$. Therefore, for a path to stay in $X \\cap R_{upper}$, its $x$-coordinate, $x(t)$, must never take a value from the Cantor set $C$.\n\nThe path starts at $P_0=(a,b)$ with $x$-coordinate $a$, and ends at $P_1=(1-a,b)$ with $x$-coordinate $1-a$. The function $x(t)$ is a continuous map from $[0,1]$ to $[0,1]$ with $x(0)=a$ and $x(1)=1-a$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, $x(t)$ must take on all values in the interval $[a, 1-a]$.\n\nThe parameter $a$ is given to be in $(0, 1/3)$. This implies $1-a \\in (2/3, 1)$. The interval $[a, 1-a]$ therefore contains the interval $[1/3, 2/3]$.\nThe points $1/3$ and $2/3$ are the endpoints of the first interval removed in the construction of the Cantor set, and they belong to $C$. Thus, the interval $[a, 1-a]$ contains points from the Cantor set $C$.\n\nSo, there must be some $t_0 \\in (0,1)$ such that $x(t_0) \\in C$. At this point, $\\gamma(t_0)=(x(t_0), y(t_0))$ with $x(t_0) \\in C$ and $y(t_0) \\ge h$. This point is in $W$ and therefore not in $X$. This is a contradiction.\nConclusion: No continuous path connecting $P_0$ and $P_1$ can lie entirely in the upper region $R_{upper} \\cap X$. Any valid path must pass through the lower region $R_{lower}$.\n\n**3. Characterize the shortest path.**\nSince any path must enter the region $y < h$, it must cross the line $y=h$. The shortest path will seek to minimize its traversal in all three directions. The total length of a path $\\gamma$ is given by $L(\\gamma) = \\int_0^1 \\sqrt{(x'(t))^2 + (y'(t))^2} dt$.\n\nA path from $P_0$ to $P_1$ can be decomposed into three segments:\n1.  A path from $P_0=(a, b)$ to a point $Q_0=(x_0, h)$ on the boundary line $y=h$.\n2.  A path from $Q_0=(x_0, h)$ to another point $Q_1=(x_1, h)$ on the same boundary line, with the path lying in the closure of the lower region.\n3.  A path from $Q_1=(x_1, h)$ to $P_1=(1-a, b)$.\n\nWe want to minimize the total length $L = L_1 + L_2 + L_3$.\n-   **Length $L_1$:** The shortest distance from a point $(a,b)$ to a line $y=h$ is a vertical line segment. So, the first segment of the path should be from $(a,b)$ to $(a,h)$. The length is $L_1 = b-h$. Here $x_0 = a$.\n-   **Length $L_3$:** Similarly, the shortest path from a point on the line $y=h$ to $(1-a, b)$ is a vertical line segment from $(1-a,h)$ to $(1-a, b)$. The length is $L_3 = b-h$. Here $x_1 = 1-a$.\n-   **Length $L_2$:** The second segment is a path from $Q_0=(a,h)$ to $Q_1=(1-a,h)$. This path takes place in the region $y \\le h$. Since the region $[0,1] \\times [0, h]$ is completely open (no parts of W are in it, save for the boundary $y=h$), the shortest path is a straight horizontal line segment. The length is $L_2 = (1-a) - a = 1-2a$.\n\nThe proposed shortest path is composed of three line segments:\n1.  From $(a,b)$ to $(a,h)$.\n2.  From $(a,h)$ to $(1-a,h)$.\n3.  From $(1-a,h)$ to $(1-a,b)$.\n\nThis path lies entirely in $X$. The vertical segments are not on any tines of the comb because $a \\notin C$ and $1-a \\notin C$. The horizontal segment is on the boundary $y=h$ of the removed tines, which is in $X$.\n\n**4. Calculate the total length.**\nThe total length of this path is the sum of the lengths of the three segments:\n$$L = L_1 + L_2 + L_3 = (b-h) + (1-2a) + (b-h)$$\n$$L = 2(b-h) + 1-2a$$\nThis is the length of the shortest possible path.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2(b-h) + 1-2a}$$", "id": "988184"}]}
