While eigenvalue analysis is once again the starting point for partitioning the space of symmetric matrices with determinant $-1$, it is not the whole story. The central challenge is to rigorously prove that the resulting subsets are themselves path-connected, which requires deploying more advanced tools from differential geometry, namely the theory of group actions and quotient manifolds.

Two points in a space are in the same connected component if there exists a continuous path between them that lies entirely within the space.\n\n1.  **Eigenvalue Analysis**\n    Any real symmetric matrix $M \\in S$ has three real eigenvalues, which we denote by $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3$. The determinant of the matrix is the product of its eigenvalues:\n    $$ \\det(M) = \\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\lambda_3 = -1 $$\n    Since the eigenvalues are real, for their product to be negative, the number of negative eigenvalues must be odd. This leads to two distinct possibilities for the signs of the eigenvalues:\n    \n    *   **Case 1:** One eigenvalue is negative, and two are positive.\n    *   **Case 2:** All three eigenvalues are negative.\n\n    Let's define two subsets of $S$ based on these cases:\n    *   $S_1 = \\{ M \\in S \\mid M \\text{ has one negative and two positive eigenvalues} \\}$\n    *   $S_2 = \\{ M \\in S \\mid M \\text{ has three negative eigenvalues} \\}$\n    \n    Clearly, $S = S_1 \\cup S_2$ and $S_1 \\cap S_2 = \\emptyset$.\n\n2.  **The Sets $S_1$ and $S_2$ are Topologically Separated**\n    To show that $S_1$ and $S_2$ form different connected components, we must demonstrate that no continuous path in $S$ can connect a matrix in $S_1$ to a matrix in $S_2$.\n    \n    Let $M(t)$ be a continuous path in $S$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$, with $M(0) \\in S_1$ and $M(1) \\in S_2$. The eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix are continuous functions of its entries. Therefore, the eigenvalues $\\lambda_1(t), \\lambda_2(t), \\lambda_3(t)$ of $M(t)$ are continuous functions of $t$.\n    \n    For the matrix to transition from having one negative eigenvalue (at $t=0$) to three negative eigenvalues (at $t=1$), at least two of the initially positive eigenvalues must become negative. For a continuous function to change sign, it must pass through zero. This means for some $t_0 \\in (0,1)$, at least one eigenvalue $\\lambda_i(t_0)$ must be zero.\n    \n    However, if any eigenvalue is zero, the determinant of the matrix is zero:\n    $$ \\det(M(t_0)) = \\lambda_1(t_0) \\lambda_2(t_0) \\lambda_3(t_0) = 0 $$\n    This contradicts the condition that for any matrix on the path, $M(t) \\in S$, its determinant must be $-1$. Therefore, no such continuous path $M(t)$ can exist within $S$. The sets $S_1$ and $S_2$ are topologically separated, and the number of connected components is at least two.\n\n3.  **Path-Connectedness of $S_1$**\n    Now we show that $S_1$ is path-connected. Let $M$ be an arbitrary matrix in $S_1$. Since $M$ is symmetric, it can be diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix $P \\in O(3)$:\n    $$ M = P D P^T $$\n    where $D = \\text{diag}(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3)$ with $\\lambda_10$, $\\lambda_20$, $\\lambda_30$, and $\\lambda_1\\lambda_2\\lambda_3 = -1$.\n    \n    First, we show that any such $M$ can be path-connected to a matrix of the form $P' D_{ref} (P')^T$, where $D_{ref} = \\text{diag}(-1, 1, 1)$. Let $\\mu_1 = -\\lambda_1 > 0$. The condition is $\\mu_1 \\lambda_2 \\lambda_3 = 1$. We can define a continuous path of eigenvalues from $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3)$ to $(-1, 1, 1)$. Let $\\Lambda(t) = (-\\mu_1^{1-t}, \\lambda_2^{1-t}, \\lambda_3^{1-t})$. The product of these values is $-(\\mu_1\\lambda_2\\lambda_3)^{1-t} = -(1)^{1-t} = -1$ for all $t \\in [0,1]$. Let $D(t) = \\text{diag}(\\Lambda(t))$. Then the path $M(t) = P D(t) P^T$ connects $M$ to $P D_{ref} P^T$ within $S_1$.\n    \n    Next, we need to show that the set of all matrices of the form $P D_{ref} P^T$ for $P \\in O(3)$ is path-connected. This set is the orbit of $D_{ref}$ under the conjugation action of $O(3)$. This orbit is diffeomorphic to the quotient space $O(3)/\\text{Stab}(D_{ref})$, where $\\text{Stab}(D_{ref})$ is the stabilizer subgroup of $D_{ref}$.\n    $$ \\text{Stab}(D_{ref}) = \\{ P \\in O(3) \\mid P D_{ref} P^T = D_{ref} \\} = \\{ P \\in O(3) \\mid P D_{ref} = D_{ref} P \\} $$\n    The condition $P D_{ref} = D_{ref} P$ for $D_{ref} = \\text{diag}(-1, 1, 1)$ implies that $P$ must be a block-diagonal matrix of the form $P = \\begin{pmatrix} \\pm 1  0 \\\\ 0  P' \\end{pmatrix}$, where $P' \\in O(2)$. This stabilizer subgroup is isomorphic to $O(1) \\times O(2)$.\n    \n    The quotient space $G/H$ is path-connected if the group $G$ is path-connected, or if the subgroup $H$ intersects every connected component of $G$. The group $O(3)$ has two connected components: $SO(3)$ (rotations, $\\det=1$) and its complement (reflections, $\\det=-1$).\n    The stabilizer $H = \\text{Stab}(D_{ref}) \\cong O(1) \\times O(2)$ contains the identity matrix $I_3$, which has $\\det(I_3)=1$. It also contains matrices like $\\text{diag}(-1, 1, 1)$, which has $\\det=-1$. Since the stabilizer intersects both connected components of $O(3)$, the quotient space $O(3)/\\text{Stab}(D_{ref})$ is path-connected.\n    Therefore, $S_1$ is path-connected.\n\n4.  **Path-Connectedness of $S_2$**\n    Now we show that $S_2$ is path-connected. Let $M \\in S_2$. Then $M = P D P^T$, where $D=\\text{diag}(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3)$ with $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3  0$ and $\\lambda_1\\lambda_2\\lambda_3=-1$.\n    \n    Let $\\mu_i = -\\lambda_i > 0$. The condition is $\\mu_1\\mu_2\\mu_3 = 1$. Similar to the previous case, we can define a continuous path of eigenvalues from $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3)$ to $(-1, -1, -1)$. This continuously deforms $D$ to $D'_{ref} = \\text{diag}(-1, -1, -1) = -I_3$. This shows that any matrix $M \\in S_2$ is path-connected to a matrix of the form $P(-I_3)P^T$.\n    \n    Let's analyze the orbit of $-I_3$. For any $P \\in O(3)$:\n    $$ P(-I_3)P^T = -P I_3 P^T = -P P^T = -I_3 $$\n    The orbit of $-I_3$ is just the singleton set $\\{-I_3\\}$. This means that any matrix $M \\in S_2$ can be continuously deformed to the single matrix $-I_3$. Since any matrix in $S_2$ can be connected to $-I_3$, any two matrices in $S_2$ can be connected to each other (by passing through $-I_3$). Thus, $S_2$ is path-connected.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The space $S$ is the disjoint union of two non-empty subsets, $S_1$ and $S_2$. We have shown that each of these subsets is path-connected. Therefore, $S_1$ and $S_2$ are the connected components of $S$. The total number of connected components is 2.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "932889"}]}
