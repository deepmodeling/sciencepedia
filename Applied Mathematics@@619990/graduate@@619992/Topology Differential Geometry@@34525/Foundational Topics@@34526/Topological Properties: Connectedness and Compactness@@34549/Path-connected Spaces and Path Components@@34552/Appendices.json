The discriminant along this path is $\\Delta(t)=(1-t)^2b^2-4ac$. Since $b^24ac$ and $(1-t)^2 \\le 1$, we have $(1-t)^2b^2 \\le b^2  4ac$, which ensures $\\Delta(t)  0$. Also $a(t)=a>0$. Hence this path connects $(a,b,c)$ to $(a,0,c)$ within $X^+$.\n   b) Now set $b=0$. For $t\\in[0,1]$, define a path with $a(t)=(1-t)a+t$, $b(t)=0$, and $c(t)=(1-t)c+t$.

Its characteristic polynomial is $p(\\lambda) = \\lambda^2 - \\text{tr}(M)\\lambda + \\det(M)$. By the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, $M$ satisfies its own characteristic equation: $M^2 - \\text{tr}(M)M + \\det(M)I = 0$.\nSince $M^2 = -I$, we can substitute this in:\n$$-I - \\text{tr}(M)M + \\det(M)I = 0 \\implies \\text{tr}(M)M = (\\det(M) - 1)I$$\nIf $\\text{tr}(M) \\neq 0$, then $M$ must be a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, $M=kI$. This would mean $k^2I = -I$, or $k^2 = -1$, which is impossible for a real number $k$. Therefore, we must have $\\text{tr}(M) = 0$.\nSubstituting $\\text{tr}(M) = 0$ back into the equation gives $(\\det(M) - 1)I = 0$, which implies $\\det(M) = 1$.\nSo, any matrix $M \\in X$ must have trace 0 and determinant 1. Let $M = \\begin{pmatrix} a  b \\\\ c  d \\end{pmatrix}$. The conditions are $a+d=0$ (so $d=-a$) and $ad-bc=1$ (so $-a^2-bc=1$, or $a^2+bc=-1$).\nThe space is $X = \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} a  b \\\\ c  -a \\end{pmatrix} \\mid a,b,c \\in \\mathbb{R}, a^2+bc = -1 \\right\\}$.\nConsider the value of the off-diagonal entry $b$. If a continuous path in $X$ connected a matrix with $b0$ to one with $b0$, the path would have to pass through a matrix with $b=0$. If $b=0$, the condition $a^2+bc=-1$ becomes $a^2=-1$, which has no real solution for $a$. Thus, no matrix in $X$ can have $b=0$.\nThis means the space $X$ is partitioned into two disjoint sets: $X_+ = \\{M \\in X \\mid b0\\}$ and $X_- = \\{M \\in X \\mid b0\\}$.\nThese sets are non-empty.
