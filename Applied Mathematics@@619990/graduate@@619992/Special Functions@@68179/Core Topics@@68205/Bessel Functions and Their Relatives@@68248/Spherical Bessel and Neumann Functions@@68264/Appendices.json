They are ubiquitous in physics, particularly in the solutions to the Helmholtz equation in spherical coordinates, which arise in problems of wave scattering and radiation.\n\nFor this problem, we will focus on the spherical Bessel functions $j_n(x)$, which are regular at the origin $x=0$.

We can address this using integration by parts. Let's rewrite the integral as:\n$$ I = \\int_0^a x^2 (x^2 j_0(x)) dx $$\nWe use integration by parts, $\\int u \\, dv = uv - \\int v \\, du$.\nLet $u = x^2$ and $dv = x^2 j_0(x) dx$.\nThen $du = 2x \\, dx$.\nTo find $v$, we integrate $dv$: $v = \\int x^2 j_0(x) dx$.

This matches perfectly.\nSo, using (I1) with $n=2$:\n$$ \\int x^3 j_1(x) dx = x^3 j_2(x) + C $$\n\nSubstituting this result back into our expression for $I$:\n$$ I = \\left[ x^4 j_1(x) \\right]_0^a - 2 \\left[ x^3 j_2(x) \\right]_0^a = \\left[ x^4 j_1(x) - 2x^3 j_2(x) \\right]_0^a $$\n\nNow we evaluate this expression at the limits of integration.\nAt the upper limit $x=a$:\n$$ a^4 j_1(a) - 2a^3 j_2(a) $$\nAt the lower limit $x=0$, we need to consider the behavior of the functions as $x \\to 0$.
