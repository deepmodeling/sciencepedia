This practice explores a classic heat conduction problem in a solid cylinder, demonstrating how physical constraints—namely, a finite temperature at the center and a fixed temperature at the boundary—naturally lead to a solution where the zeros of the Bessel function $J_0(x)$ define the fundamental modes of heat dissipation. By solving this problem, you will see firsthand how these mathematical zeros act as eigenvalues that dictate the behavior of a physical system.", "problem": "Consider a long, solid metallic cylinder of radius $R$. The thermal diffusivity of the metal is $k$. The temperature distribution within the cylinder, $u(r, t)$, is a function of the radial distance $r$ from the center and time $t$, and is independent of the angular and axial coordinates. The surface of the cylinder at $r=R$ is maintained at a temperature of zero for all time $t > 0$. At time $t=0$, the cylinder has an initial temperature profile given by $u(r, 0) = T_0 J_0(\\alpha_{0,1} r/R)$, where $T_0$ is a constant with units of temperature, $J_0(x)$ is the Bessel function of the first kind of order zero, and $\\alpha_{0,1}$ is the first positive root of the equation $J_0(x)=0$.\n\nThe general solution for the temperature $u(r, t)$ that satisfies the governing heat equation for this system can be expressed as an infinite series:\n$$\nu(r,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\exp(-k \\lambda_n^2 t) \\left[A_n J_0(\\lambda_n r) + B_n Y_0(\\lambda_n r)\\right]\n$$\nwhere $J_0(x)$ and $Y_0(x)$ are the Bessel functions of the first and second kind of order zero, respectively. The terms $\\lambda_n$ are positive constants determined from the boundary conditions, and $A_n$ and $B_n$ are coefficients determined from the initial condition.\n\nDetermine the temperature at the center of the cylinder ($r=0$) at the specific time $t = \\frac{R^2}{k (\\alpha_{0,1})^2}$. Express your answer in terms of $T_0$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the temperature at the center of a solid cylinder. The general solution for the temperature distribution $u(r,t)$ is given as:\n$$\nu(r,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\exp(-k \\lambda_n^2 t) \\left[A_n J_0(\\lambda_n r) + B_n Y_0(\\lambda_n r)\\right]\n$$\nThe first step is to apply physical reasoning to simplify this general solution. The cylinder is described as \"solid\", which means the domain of the solution includes the central axis, where the radial coordinate is $r=0$. A physical property like temperature must be finite everywhere within the cylinder.\n\nWe must examine the behavior of the functions in the solution as $r \\to 0$. The Bessel function of the first kind, $J_0(x)$, is well-behaved at the origin, with $J_0(0) = 1$. However, the Bessel function of the second kind, $Y_0(x)$, is singular at the origin; it diverges to negative infinity as $x \\to 0$. Specifically, $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} Y_0(x) = -\\infty$.\n\nFor the temperature $u(r,t)$ to remain finite at $r=0$, the terms involving $Y_0(\\lambda_n r)$ must not be present in the solution. This is achieved by setting their coefficients to zero. Therefore, we must impose the physical condition that $B_n = 0$ for all $n$.\n\nWith this condition, the physically acceptable solution simplifies to:\n$$\nu(r,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\exp(-k \\lambda_n^2 t) J_0(\\lambda_n r)\n$$\nNext, we apply the boundary condition that the surface temperature is zero: $u(R, t) = 0$ for $t > 0$.\n$$\nu(R,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\exp(-k \\lambda_n^2 t) J_0(\\lambda_n R) = 0\n$$\nFor this equality to hold for all $t > 0$ and for a non-trivial temperature distribution (i.e., not all $A_n$ are zero), each term in the sum must satisfy $J_0(\\lambda_n R) = 0$. This condition determines the allowed values for $\\lambda_n$. If $\\alpha_{0,n}$ denotes the $n$-th positive root (or zero) of the Bessel function $J_0(x)$, then we must have $\\lambda_n R = \\alpha_{0,n}$. This gives the separation constants:\n$$\n\\lambda_n = \\frac{\\alpha_{0,n}}{R}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the solution gives:\n$$\nu(r,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\exp\\left(-k \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{0,n}}{R}\\right)^2 t\\right) J_0\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{0,n} r}{R}\\right)\n$$\nNow we apply the initial condition at $t=0$: $u(r,0) = T_0 J_0(\\alpha_{0,1} r/R)$.\nSetting $t=0$ in our series solution, we get:\n$$\nu(r,0) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n J_0\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{0,n} r}{R}\\right)\n$$\nComparing this with the given initial condition:\n$$\nT_0 J_0\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{0,1} r}{R}\\right) = A_1 J_0\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{0,1} r}{R}\\right) + A_2 J_0\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{0,2} r}{R}\\right) + A_3 J_0\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{0,3} r}{R}\\right) + \\dots\n$$\nThe functions $J_0(\\alpha_{0,n} r/R)$ form an orthogonal set on the interval $[0, R]$ with respect to the weight function $r$. Due to this orthogonality (or by direct inspection), we can equate the coefficients of the basis functions. This implies that:\n$A_1 = T_0$\n$A_n = 0$ for all $n > 1$.\n\nTherefore, the infinite series for the solution collapses to a single term:\n$$\nu(r,t) = T_0 \\exp\\left(-k \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{0,1}}{R}\\right)^2 t\\right) J_0\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{0,1} r}{R}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the temperature at the center ($r=0$) at time $t = \\frac{R^2}{k (\\alpha_{0,1})^2}$.\nFirst, let's find the temperature at the center as a function of time by setting $r=0$. Using the property $J_0(0) = 1$:\n$$\nu(0,t) = T_0 \\exp\\left(-k \\frac{(\\alpha_{0,1})^2}{R^2} t\\right) J_0(0) = T_0 \\exp\\left(-k \\frac{(\\alpha_{0,1})^2}{R^2} t\\right)\n$$\nNow, substitute the specific time $t = \\frac{R^2}{k (\\alpha_{0,1})^2}$:\n$$\nu\\left(0, t=\\frac{R^2}{k (\\alpha_{0,1})^2}\\right) = T_0 \\exp\\left(-k \\frac{(\\alpha_{0,1})^2}{R^2} \\cdot \\frac{R^2}{k (\\alpha_{0,1})^2}\\right) = T_0 \\exp(-1)\n$$\nThus, the temperature at the center at the specified time is $T_0/e$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{T_0 \\exp(-1)}$$", "id": "2157854"}, {"introduction": "While the physical significance of Bessel function zeros is clear, locating them, especially for high-order modes, can be challenging.
