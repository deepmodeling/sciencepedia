Solutions to this equation can be found using the method of Frobenius, which involves expanding the solution $y(x)$ as a power series around a specific point $x_0$.\n\nThe nature of the solution depends on whether the expansion point $x_0$ is an ordinary point or a singular point of the equation. A point $x_0$ is an ordinary point if the coefficients of the standardized equation $y'' + p(x)y' + q(x)y = 0$ are analytic at $x_0$. Otherwise, $x_0$ is a singular point.\n\nAccording to a fundamental theorem in the theory of differential equations, for a series solution expanded around an ordinary point $x_0$, the radius of convergence $R$ is at least the distance from $x_0$ to the nearest singular point in the complex plane.
