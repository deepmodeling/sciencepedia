This exercise provides hands-on practice in this fundamental skill, demonstrating how to find the value of a specific Legendre polynomial, $P_n(x_0)$, for a given argument $x_0$. It also highlights a powerful algebraic technique to simplify the series expansion, turning a potentially tedious calculation into an elegant solution [@problem_id:677702].", "problem": "The generating function for the Legendre polynomials, $P_n(x)$, is given by\n$$G(x, t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 2xt + t^2}} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} P_n(x) t^n, \\quad \\text{for } |t| < 1.$$\nFor a fixed value of the argument, $x = x_0$, this expression becomes a function of $t$ only, and the values of the Legendre polynomials $P_n(x_0)$ are the coefficients of the Maclaurin series expansion of $G(x_0, t)$.\n\nConsider the specific case where $x_0 = 1/2$. The generating function simplifies to\n$$G(1/2, t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - t + t^2}}.$$\nBy finding the Maclaurin series expansion of this function, determine the exact numerical value of the Legendre polynomial $P_5(1/2)$.", "solution": "The problem requires finding the coefficient of $t^5$ in the Maclaurin series expansion of the function $f(t) = (1 - t + t^2)^{-1/2}$. This coefficient will be equal to $P_5(1/2)$.\n\nA direct computation of the fifth derivative of $f(t)$ at $t=0$ would be exceedingly cumbersome. A more elegant approach involves algebraic manipulation of the function using the generalized binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we rewrite the expression inside the square root. We can use the identity for the sum of cubes, $a^3+b^3 = (a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)$. Here, with $a=t$ and $b=1$, we have $t^3+1 = (t+1)(t^2-t+1)$.\nThus, we can write:\n$$1 - t + t^2 = \\frac{1 + t^3}{1 + t}.$$\n\nSubstituting this into the function $f(t)$:\n$$f(t) = \\left(\\frac{1 + t^3}{1 + t}\\right)^{-1/2} = (1 + t)^{1/2} (1 + t^3)^{-1/2}.$$\n\nNow, we can expand each factor using the generalized binomial theorem, $(1+u)^\\alpha = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{\\alpha}{k} u^k$.\n\nFor the first factor, $(1+t)^{1/2}$, we have $\\alpha = 1/2$ and $u=t$. We need to find the series expansion up to the $t^5$ term.\nThe binomial coefficients are:\n$\\binom{1/2}{0} = 1$\n$\\binom{1/2}{1} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$\\binom{1/2}{2} = \\frac{(1/2)(-1/2)}{2!} = -\\frac{1}{8}$\n$\\binom{1/2}{3} = \\frac{(1/2)(-1/2)(-3/2)}{3!} = \\frac{3/8}{6} = \\frac{1}{16}$\n$\\binom{1/2}{4} = \\frac{(1/2)(-1/2)(-3/2)(-5/2)}{4!} = \\frac{15/16}{24} = -\\frac{5}{128}$\n$\\binom{1/2}{5} = \\frac{(1/2)(-1/2)(-3/2)(-5/2)(-7/2)}{5!} = \\frac{-105/32}{120} = \\frac{7}{256}$\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n$$(1+t)^{1/2} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}t - \\frac{1}{8}t^2 + \\frac{1}{16}t^3 - \\frac{5}{128}t^4 + \\frac{7}{256}t^5 + O(t^6).$$\n\nFor the second factor, $(1+t^3)^{-1/2}$, we have $\\alpha = -1/2$ and $u=t^3$. We only need the first few terms, as higher powers of $t^3$ will not contribute to the $t^5$ term in the final product.\nThe binomial coefficients are:\n$\\binom{-1/2}{0} = 1$\n$\\binom{-1/2}{1} = -\\frac{1}{2}$\n$\\binom{-1/2}{2} = \\frac{(-1/2)(-3/2)}{2!} = \\frac{3}{8}$\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n$$(1+t^3)^{-1/2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{2}t^3 + \\frac{3}{8}t^6 + O(t^9).$$\n\nNow we multiply the two series expansions:\n$$f(t) = \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}t - \\frac{1}{8}t^2 + \\frac{1}{16}t^3 - \\frac{5}{128}t^4 + \\frac{7}{256}t^5 + \\dots\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}t^3 + \\dots\\right).$$\n\nWe are looking for the coefficient of $t^5$, which we denote as $[t^5]f(t)$. This coefficient is the sum of products of coefficients from the two series whose powers of $t$ add up to 5.\nThe possible combinations are:\n1. The $t^5$ term from the first series and the constant term ($t^0$) from the second series:\n   $$ \\left( \\frac{7}{256} t^5 \\right) \\times (1) = \\frac{7}{256} t^5 $$\n2. The $t^2$ term from the first series and the $t^3$ term from the second series:\n   $$ \\left( -\\frac{1}{8} t^2 \\right) \\times \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} t^3 \\right) = \\frac{1}{16} t^5 $$\n\nNo other combinations of terms from the truncated series will produce a $t^5$ term. For example, the next term in the second series is $t^6$, which is too high.\n\nThe coefficient of $t^5$ is the sum of the coefficients from these two contributions:\n$$P_5(1/2) = [t^5]f(t) = \\frac{7}{256} + \\frac{1}{16}.$$\n\nTo add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 256.\n$$P_5(1/2) = \\frac{7}{256} + \\frac{16 \\times 1}{16 \\times 16} = \\frac{7}{256} + \\frac{16}{256} = \\frac{7+16}{256} = \\frac{23}{256}.$$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{23}{256}} $$", "id": "677702"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply defining the polynomials, the generating function is a powerful tool for deriving new mathematical identities.
