{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "This first practice demonstrates one of the most powerful applications of hypergeometric transformations: analytic continuation. We'll start with a hypergeometric function whose defining series diverges at the specified point. By applying a transformation, we can express it in terms of a different hypergeometric function that results in a terminating series—a finite polynomial—which can be easily evaluated. This exercise showcases how transformations extend the domain of the function beyond its initial radius of convergence [@problem_id:741854].", "problem": "The Gauss hypergeometric function, denoted by $_2F_1(a, b; c; z)$, is a special function defined by the hypergeometric series:\n$$\n_2F_1(a, b; c; z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(a)_n (b)_n}{(c)_n} \\frac{z^n}{n!}\n$$\nwhere $(x)_n = x(x+1)\\cdots(x+n-1)$ is the Pochhammer symbol (rising factorial), and $c$ is not a non-positive integer. This series converges for all complex $z$ within the unit disk, i.e., $|z| < 1$. For values of $z$ outside this disk, the function is defined by analytic continuation.\n\nOne of the fundamental tools for analytic continuation of the hypergeometric function is Pfaff's transformation:\n$$\n_2F_1(a, b; c; z) = (1-z)^{-a} {}_2F_1\\left(a, c-b; c; \\frac{z}{z-1}\\right)\n$$\nThis identity relates the value of the function at argument $z$ to its value at a different argument $\\frac{z}{z-1}$. This can be particularly useful when the original series for $_2F_1(a, b; c; z)$ diverges, but the series for the transformed function converges.\n\nA special case arises when one of the top parameters, $a$ or $b$, is a non-positive integer (e.g., $0, -1, -2, \\dots$). In such cases, the Pochhammer symbol $(a)_n$ or $(b)_n$ becomes zero for sufficiently large $n$, causing the hypergeometric series to terminate and become a finite polynomial in $z$.\n\nYour task is to find the value of the hypergeometric function $_2F_1(4, 3/2; 1/2; -1)$.
