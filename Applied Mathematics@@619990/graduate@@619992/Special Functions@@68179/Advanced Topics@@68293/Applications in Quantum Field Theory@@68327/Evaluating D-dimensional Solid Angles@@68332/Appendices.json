Let $X_{(1)}$ be the largest order statistic, i.e., $X_{(1)} = \\max\\{X_1, \\dots, X_D\\}$. The condition $\\mathcal{O}$ is equivalent to saying the event $\\{X_1 = X_{(1)}\\}$ has occurred, along with a specific ordering for the rest of the variables. So, the condition $X_1 > 0$ under the event $\\mathcal{O}$ is equivalent to the condition $X_{(1)} > 0$. Therefore,\n$$\nP(X_1 > 0 \\mid \\mathcal{O}) = P(X_{(1)} > 0 \\mid \\mathcal{O}) = P(X_{(1)} > 0)\n$$\nThe last equality holds because the distribution of the maximum value $X_{(1)}$ is independent of which specific variable $X_i$ happens to be the maximum.\n\nNow we calculate $P(X_{(1)} > 0)$.
