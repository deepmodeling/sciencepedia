This foundational exercise demonstrates how different types of matter fields—in this case, both fermions and scalars—contribute to the energy-dependence of the gauge coupling. By tackling this problem [@problem_id:641430], you will practice calculating and combining these individual contributions, illustrating the additive nature of quantum corrections and observing the characteristic 'screening' effect a hallmark of such theories.", "problem": "In the framework of perturbative quantum field theory, the strength of an interaction, represented by a coupling constant, depends on the energy scale at which the interaction is probed. This dependence is described by the beta function, $\\beta(g) = \\mu \\frac{dg}{d\\mu}$, where $g$ is the coupling constant and $\\mu$ is the renormalization scale.\n\nConsider a simple gauge theory based on the abelian group U(1), similar to Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). The matter content of this theory consists of:\n1.  A single massless Dirac fermion field, $\\psi$, with charge $e$.\n2.  A single massless complex scalar field, $\\phi$, also with charge $e$.\n\nThe interaction of these fields with the U(1) gauge field (photon), $A_\\mu$, is governed by the gauge coupling $e$. To leading order in perturbation theory (one-loop), the beta function for this coupling, $\\beta(e)$, receives contributions from both the fermion and the scalar fields running in loops.\n\nYour task is to calculate the one-loop beta function, $\\beta(e)$, for the gauge coupling $e$ in this theory. Express your answer as an analytic function of the coupling $e$ and fundamental mathematical constants.", "solution": "The one-loop beta function for the gauge coupling $e$ in a U(1) gauge theory is determined by the contribution of all charged particles to the vacuum polarization of the photon. The contributions from different particle species are additive at the one-loop level. Therefore, we can calculate the contribution from the Dirac fermion and the complex scalar separately and then sum them up.\n\nThe beta function is defined as $\\beta(e) = \\mu \\frac{de}{d\\mu}$, where $\\mu$ is the renormalization scale. At one loop, it takes the form $\\beta(e) = b e^3$ for some constant $b$.\n\nThe total beta function is the sum of the contributions from the fermion loop and the scalar loop:\n$$\n\\beta(e) = \\beta_{\\text{fermion}}(e) + \\beta_{\\text{scalar}}(e)\n$$\n\n**1. Contribution from the Massless Dirac Fermion**\n\nThe contribution of a single massless Dirac fermion with charge $e$ to the U(1) beta function is a standard result from Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). The calculation involves evaluating the one-loop fermion correction to the photon propagator. This calculation, typically performed using dimensional regularization, yields the vacuum polarization tensor. The divergent part of this tensor determines the photon propagator renormalization constant $Z_3$, which in turn determines the beta function.\n\nThe well-known result for the contribution of one Dirac fermion of charge $e$ is:\n$$\n\\beta_{\\text{fermion}}(e) = \\frac{4}{3} \\frac{e^3}{(4\\pi)^2} = \\frac{e^3}{12\\pi^2}\n$$\nThis positive sign indicates that the fermion loop \"screens\" the charge less effectively at higher energies (shorter distances), leading to an increase in the effective coupling strength. This is the phenomenon observed in QED.\n\n**2. Contribution from the Massless Complex Scalar**\n\nSimilarly, the charged complex scalar field also contributes to the vacuum polarization through a one-loop diagram. The theory describing the interaction of a complex scalar field with a U(1) gauge field is known as scalar QED. The one-loop calculation for a single massless complex scalar field with charge $e$ gives the following contribution to the beta function:\n$$\n\\beta_{\\text{scalar}}(e) = \\frac{1}{3} \\frac{e^3}{(4\\pi)^2} = \\frac{e^3}{48\\pi^2}\n$$\nLike the fermion, the scalar contribution is also positive, indicating a screening effect that decreases at higher energies. The scalar contribution is $1/4$ of the Dirac fermion's contribution.\n\n**3. Total Beta Function**\n\nThe total one-loop beta function is the sum of these two contributions:\n$$\n\\beta(e) = \\beta_{\\text{fermion}}(e) + \\beta_{\\text{scalar}}(e) = \\frac{e^3}{12\\pi^2} + \\frac{e^3}{48\\pi^2}\n$$\n\nTo add these fractions, we find a common denominator:\n$$\n\\frac{e^3}{12\\pi^2} = \\frac{4e^3}{48\\pi^2}\n$$\n\nSo, the sum is:\n$$\n\\beta(e) = \\frac{4e^3}{48\\pi^2} + \\frac{e^3}{48\\pi^2} = \\frac{(4+1)e^3}{48\\pi^2}\n$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\beta(e) = \\frac{5e^3}{48\\pi^2}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the one-loop beta function for the specified theory.
