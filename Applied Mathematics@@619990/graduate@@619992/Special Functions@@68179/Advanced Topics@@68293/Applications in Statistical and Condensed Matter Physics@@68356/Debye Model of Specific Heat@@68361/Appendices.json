A fundamental constraint of the model is that the total number of vibrational modes must equal the crystal's vibrational degrees of freedom. For a monatomic crystal containing $N$ atoms, there are $3N$ such degrees of freedom.\n\nTo enforce this constraint, the model introduces a cutoff wavenumber, $k_D$, known as the Debye wavenumber. It is assumed that all allowed phonon wavevectors lie within a sphere of radius $k_D$ in reciprocal space (k-space). The volume of this sphere, combined with the density of states in k-space, determines the total number of modes.\n\nConsider a monatomic crystal with a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice structure.

The cell has one atom at its center (fully contained within the cell) and eight atoms at its corners. Each corner atom is shared by eight adjacent cells.\nNumber of atoms per conventional cell = (1 center atom) + (8 corner atoms) $\\times$ ($\\frac{1}{8}$ contribution per atom) = $1 + 1 = 2$ atoms.\n\nThe volume of this conventional cubic cell is $V_{cell} = a^3$.\nThe number density of atoms, $n$, which is the number of atoms $N$ per total crystal volume $V$, is therefore:\n$$ n = \\frac{N}{V} = \\frac{2}{a^3} $$\n\n**Step 2: Relate the total number of modes to the Debye wavenumber $k_D$.**\nThe density of allowed wavevector states in k-space for a crystal of volume $V$ is given by $\\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^3}$.

The volume of this Debye sphere is:\n$$ V_D = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_D^3 $$\n\nThe total number of allowed wavevectors within this sphere is the product of the k-space volume and the density of states:\n$$ N_k = V_D \\times \\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^3} = \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_D^3\\right) \\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^3} = \\frac{4\\pi k_D^3 V}{3 \\cdot 8\\pi^3} = \\frac{V k_D^3}{6\\pi^2} $$\n\nFor each allowed wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$, there are three possible polarizations for the vibrational modes (one longitudinal and two transverse). Thus, the total number of vibrational modes is three times the number of allowed k-states.\n$$ N_{modes} = 3 \\times N_k = 3 \\times \\frac{V k_D^3}{6\\pi^2} = \\frac{V k_D^3}{2\\pi^2} $$\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Debye condition to solve for $k_D$.**\nThe core principle of the Debye model is to equate the total number of vibrational modes to the total number of degrees of freedom in the crystal. For a monatomic crystal with $N$ atoms, this is $3N$.\n$$ N_{modes} = 3N $$\nSubstituting our expression for $N_{modes}$:\n$$ \\frac{V k_D^3}{2\\pi^2} = 3N $$\n\nWe can now solve for $k_D$.
