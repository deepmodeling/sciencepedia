It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The task involves solving the one-dimensional time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle of mass $m$ in a symmetric double-well potential $V(x) = a (x^2 - b^2)^2$. The goal is to compute the energy splitting $\\Delta E$ of the ground state doublet, which arises from quantum tunneling through the central barrier. This will be accomplished using two distinct methods: a semiclassical Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) approximation and a numerically exact diagonalization using the Finite Difference Method (FDM). The results from both methods will be compared. We work in atomic units where $\\hbar = 1$. The Hamiltonian is given by:\n$$\nH = -\\dfrac{1}{2 m}\\dfrac{d^2}{dx^2} + V(x)\n$$\n\nFirst, we derive the computational steps for the WKB approximation. This method provides an analytical estimate that is accurate in the limit of high, wide barriers.\n\nThe WKB formula for the energy splitting of the lowest doublet in a symmetric double-well potential is:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{WKB}} = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_0}{\\pi} e^{-S/\\hbar}\n$$\nIn atomic units, this becomes $\\Delta_{\\text{WKB}} = \\frac{\\omega_0}{\\pi} e^{-S}$. Here, $\\omega_0$ is the classical angular frequency of small oscillations within a single well, and $S$ is the classical action for tunneling under the barrier.\n\nTo find $\\omega_0$, we perform a harmonic approximation of the potential $V(x)$ around one of its minima, for instance at $x=b$. The potential is expanded in a Taylor series up to the second order around $x=b$:\n$V(x) \\approx V(b) + V'(b)(x-b) + \\frac{1}{2}V''(b)(x-b)^2$.\nThe potential is defined such that $V(b) = 0$ and $V'(x) = 4ax(x^2-b^2)$, so $V'(b)=0$. The second derivative is $V''(x) = 4a(3x^2 - b^2)$, which gives $V''(b) = 4a(3b^2 - b^2) = 8ab^2$.\nThe approximated harmonic potential is $V_{\\text{HO}}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(8ab^2)(x-b)^2$. This corresponds to a harmonic oscillator with a spring constant $k = 8ab^2$. The angular frequency is thus $\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{k/m} = \\sqrt{8ab^2/m}$.\n\nThe ground-state energy within this single-well harmonic approximation is the zero-point energy $E_0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega_0$. With $\\hbar=1$, we have:\n$$\nE_0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2ab^2}{m}}\n$$\nThis energy $E_0$ is used as the energy level for the tunneling particle in the WKB calculation.\n\nThe action integral $S$, also known as the Gamow factor exponent, is calculated across the classically forbidden region:\n$$\nS = \\int_{-c}^{c} |p(x)| \\, dx = \\int_{-c}^{c} \\sqrt{2m(V(x) - E_0)} \\, dx\n$$\nThe limits of integration, $\\pm c$, are the inner classical turning points where the energy $E_0$ equals the potential energy $V(x)$. They are found by solving the equation $V(x) = E_0$:\n$a(x^2 - b^2)^2 = E_0 \\implies x^2 - b^2 = \\pm\\sqrt{E_0/a} \\implies x^2 = b^2 \\pm \\sqrt{E_0/a}$.\nThe inner turning points correspond to the smaller positive solution for $x^2$, so we take the minus sign: $c^2 = b^2 - \\sqrt{E_0/a}$, which gives $c = \\sqrt{b^2 - \\sqrt{E_0/a}}$. The existence of a real solution for $c$ is guaranteed by the problem condition that the barrier height $V(0) = ab^4$ is greater than $E_0$. The integral for $S$ does not have a simple analytical solution for this potential and must be evaluated numerically.\n\nNext, we detail the numerically exact approach using the Finite Difference Method (FDM). This method transforms the continuous differential Schrödinger equation into a discrete matrix eigenvalue problem.\n\nThe spatial domain $[-L, L]$ is discretized into a uniform grid of $N$ points $x_i = -L + i \\cdot \\Delta x$ for $i=0, \\dots, N-1$, with grid spacing $\\Delta x = 2L/(N-1)$. The wavefunction $\\psi(x)$ is represented by a vector of its values at these grid points, $\\vec{\\psi} = (\\psi_0, \\psi_1, \\dots, \\psi_{N-1})^T$.\n\nThe second derivative in the kinetic energy operator is approximated by a second-order central difference:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2}\\bigg|_{x_i} \\approx \\frac{\\psi(x_{i+1}) - 2\\psi(x_i) + \\psi(x_{i-1})}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\nThe problem specifies Dirichlet boundary conditions, $\\psi(-L) = \\psi(L) = 0$, which translates to $\\psi_0 = 0$ and $\\psi_{N-1} = 0$. This means we only need to solve for the wavefunction at the $N-2$ interior points, from $x_1$ to $x_{N-2}$. The Schrödinger equation at an interior point $x_j$ (where $j=1, \\dots, N-2$) becomes:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{2m} \\left( \\frac{\\psi_{j+1} - 2\\psi_j + \\psi_{j-1}}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\right) + V(x_j)\\psi_j = E \\psi_j\n$$\nThis can be rearranged into a matrix equation $\\mathbf{H}\\vec{\\psi'} = E\\vec{\\psi'}$, where $\\vec{\\psi'}$ is the vector of wavefunction values at the interior points, and $\\mathbf{H}$ is an $(N-2) \\times (N-2)$ symmetric tridiagonal matrix. The elements of this matrix are:\n- Diagonal elements: $H_{jj} = \\frac{1}{m(\\Delta x)^2} + V(x_{j})$\n- Off-diagonal elements: $H_{j,j+1} = H_{j+1,j} = -\\frac{1}{2m(\\Delta x)^2}$\n\nThis matrix eigenvalue problem can be solved numerically to find the eigenvalues $E_n$. The two lowest eigenvalues, $E_0^{\\text{exact}}$ and $E_1^{\\text{exact}}$, correspond to the ground state and the first excited state, which form the tunneling doublet. The numerically exact splitting is then:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{exact}} = E_1^{\\text{exact}} - E_0^{\\text{exact}}\n$$\n\nThe provided program implements both approaches. For the WKB calculation, it first computes $\\omega_0$ and $E_0$, then finds the turning point $c$ using a root-finding algorithm (`scipy.optimize.brentq`), and finally evaluates the action integral $S$ using numerical quadrature (`scipy.integrate.quad`). For the FDM calculation, it constructs the tridiagonal Hamiltonian matrix and uses a specialized eigensolver (`scipy.linalg.eigh_tridiagonal`) to efficiently find the two lowest eigenvalues.
