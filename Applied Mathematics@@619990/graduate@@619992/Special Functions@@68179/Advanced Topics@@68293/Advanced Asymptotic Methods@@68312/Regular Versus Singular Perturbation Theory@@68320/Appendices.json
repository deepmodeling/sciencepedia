This problem [@problem_id:750745] will guide you through the process of finding the correct fractional power of $\\epsilon$ needed to accurately describe how the degenerate root splits into two distinct ones, a fundamental skill in perturbation analysis.", "problem": "Consider the algebraic equation\n$$ (x-a)^2 = \\epsilon(x+b) $$\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are given positive real constants, and $\\epsilon$ is a small positive parameter, i.e., $0 < \\epsilon \\ll 1$.\n\nFor $\\epsilon=0$, the equation reduces to $(x-a)^2=0$, which has a degenerate root at $x_0=a$. The perturbation term on the right-hand side, $\\epsilon(x+b)$, breaks this degeneracy, leading to two distinct roots. A standard regular perturbation expansion in integer powers of $\\epsilon$ fails for this type of problem. This is a characteristic of a singular perturbation problem.\n\nYour task is to find the asymptotic approximations for the two distinct roots of this equation. The approximations should be accurate to the first non-trivial order that describes the splitting of the degenerate root. Express your answer in terms of $a$, $b$, and $\\epsilon$.", "solution": "The given equation is $(x-a)^2 = \\epsilon(x+b)$. For $\\epsilon=0$, the equation has a degenerate root $x_0=a$. We are looking for the two roots for small but non-zero $\\epsilon$. Since a regular power series expansion in $\\epsilon$ fails, we anticipate a non-integer power of $\\epsilon$ in the expansion.\n\nLet's analyze the scaling of the deviation from the unperturbed root. Let $x = a + \\delta$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$$((a+\\delta)-a)^2 = \\epsilon((a+\\delta)+b)$$\n$$\\delta^2 = \\epsilon(a+b+\\delta)$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for the correction $\\delta$:\n$$\\delta^2 - \\epsilon\\delta - \\epsilon(a+b) = 0$$\nFor $\\epsilon \\ll 1$, we can see that the term $\\epsilon\\delta$ is of a smaller order than the other terms. If we assume $\\delta$ is small, then $\\delta^2 \\approx \\epsilon(a+b)$, which suggests that $\\delta$ is of the order of $\\sqrt{\\epsilon}$. Let's verify this. If $\\delta \\sim \\sqrt{\\epsilon}$, then $\\delta^2 \\sim \\epsilon$ and $\\epsilon\\delta \\sim \\epsilon^{3/2}$.
