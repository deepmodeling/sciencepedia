The roots $e_1, e_2, e_3$ are the solutions to the equation $4t^3 - g_2(\\tau)t - g_3(\\tau) = 0$.\n2. We are given that for the square lattice, $\\tau = i$ and the modular invariant $g_3(i) = 0$. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n$$4t^3 - g_2(i)t = 0$$\n3. We can factor this equation as $t(4t^2 - g_2(i)) = 0$. The three roots are thus $t=0$ and the solutions to $4t^2 = g_2(i)$, which are $t = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{g_2(i)}}{2}$.

The roots are $e_1 = \\wp(1/2; i)$, $e_2 = \\wp(i/2; i)$, and $e_3 = \\wp((1+i)/2; i)$. The Weierstrass $\\wp$-function for a square lattice has the symmetry $\\wp(iz; i) = -\\wp(z; i)$.\n5.

From Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of $4t^3 - g_2 t - g_3 = 0$ must be zero. Therefore, $e_1 + e_2 + e_3 = 0$. Substituting $e_2 = -e_1$, we get $e_1 + (-e_1) + e_3 = 0$, which implies $e_3 = 0$.\n7. Now we have uniquely identified the values: $e_1(i)$, $e_2(i)=-e_1(i)$, and $e_3(i)=0$.\n8.
