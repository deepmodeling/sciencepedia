Perturbations are typically decomposed into scalar, vector, and tensor modes, which evolve independently at linear order.\n\nVector perturbations correspond to rotational or vortical fluid flows. In the synchronous gauge, a pure vector perturbation can be characterized by a metric perturbation whose Fourier amplitude is denoted by $V_k(t)$. On super-Hubble scales (where the comoving wavenumber $k$ is much smaller than the comoving Hubble parameter $aH$), the evolution of this amplitude is governed by the following differential equation derived from the linearized Einstein equations:\n$$\n\\ddot{V}_k(t) + 3H(t)\\dot{V}_k(t) = 0\n$$\nHere, $t$ is the cosmological time, the dot denotes a derivative with respect to time ($d/dt$), and $H(t) = \\dot{a}/a$ is the Hubble parameter, with $a(t)$ being the scale factor.
