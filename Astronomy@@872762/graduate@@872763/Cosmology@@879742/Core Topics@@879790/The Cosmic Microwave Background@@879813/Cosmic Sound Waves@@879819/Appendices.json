This problem explores the evolution of the Jeans mass in the early universe, specifically during the radiation-dominated era, well before the epoch of matter-radiation equality.\n\nConsider a simplified model of the early universe containing a tightly coupled fluid of photons and baryons, along with a separate component of non-interacting cold dark matter. The expansion of the universe during this era is driven by the energy density of radiation (photons), $\\rho_{\\gamma}$.

The pressure support within the photon-baryon fluid is overwhelmingly provided by the photons. In the deep radiation-dominated era, the speed of sound, $c_s$, in this fluid can be considered constant.\n5.  The Jeans mass is proportional to the matter density contained within a sphere whose radius is set by the Jeans length, $\\lambda_J$. The Jeans length is the distance a sound wave can travel in one Hubble time ($t_H = 1/H$). Therefore, the Jeans mass can be expressed through the proportionality $M_J \\propto \\rho_m \\lambda_J^3$, and the physical Jeans length is given by $\\lambda_J \\propto c_s / H$.\n\nAssuming the Jeans mass scales with the scale factor as a power law, $M_J \\propto a^n$, determine the value of the exponent $n$.", "solution": "We use the given scalings and definitions.
