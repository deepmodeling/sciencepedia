This practice is designed to build a strong physical understanding of why a time-varying potential leaves a net imprint on a photon's energy and to develop valuable skills in approximation and estimation [@problem_id:1892390].", "problem": "A photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is an ancient relic of the early universe. As it travels towards us, it can pass through large-scale structures like superclusters of galaxies. We can model such a supercluster as a region of space with a characteristic size $L$ and an associated gravitational potential $\\Phi$, which is negative (a potential well).\n\nIn a static universe, a photon gains energy (gravitational blueshift) upon entering the potential well and loses the exact same amount of energy (gravitational redshift) upon exiting, resulting in no net energy change. However, in an expanding universe with dark energy, these large-scale potentials are not static; they decay over time.\n\nConsider a simplified model for this phenomenon, known as the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. A CMB photon travels at the speed of light, $c$. Upon entering a region of gravitational potential $\\Phi$, the photon's fractional energy change $\\Delta E / E$ is given by $-\\Phi / c^2$. The universe is undergoing accelerated expansion, driven by dark energy. This acceleration suppresses the growth of a supercluster, causing its gravitational potential to decay. We model this decay with the simple relation $\\dot{\\Phi} = -H \\Phi$, where $\\dot{\\Phi}$ is the time derivative of the potential and $H$ is the Hubble parameter, which we assume to be constant for the duration of the photon's transit through the structure.\n\nLet $|\\Phi|$ be the magnitude of the gravitational potential as the photon first enters the supercluster. Assuming the change in potential during the photon's transit is small, derive an expression for the magnitude of the net fractional temperature fluctuation, $|\\Delta T / T|$, of the CMB photon after it has completely traversed the structure.
