This exercise highlights the crucial interplay between the inflationary epoch and the beginning of the hot Big Bang.", "problem": "In the standard cosmological model, a period of cosmic inflation in the early universe is invoked to solve the flatness problem. Inflation drives the curvature density parameter, $\\Omega_k$, extremely close to zero. However, in the subsequent reheating phase, this parameter can be amplified. Consider a model where, after inflation ends at a scale factor $a_{end}$ and Hubble parameter $H_{end}$, the universe enters a reheating phase dominated by the coherent oscillations of the inflaton scalar field. In this phase, the energy density of the inflaton, $\\rho_\\phi$, scales like non-relativistic matter, i.e., $\\rho_\\phi(a) \\propto a^{-3}$, and it dictates the expansion rate of the universe.\n\nDuring this reheating phase, relativistic particles are produced solely through a gravitational mechanism, where the expansion of spacetime itself sources their creation. The energy density of these particles, $\\rho_r$, evolves according to $\\dot{\\rho}_r + 4H\\rho_r = \\mathcal{P}$, where the production rate is given by $\\mathcal{P} = \\beta H^4$. Here, $H$ is the Hubble parameter, and $\\beta$ is a dimensionless constant parameterizing the efficiency of particle production. Assume that the radiation energy density is zero at the end of inflation, $\\rho_r(a_{end}) = 0$.\n\nThe reheating phase is considered to end at a scale factor $a_{rh}$ when the energy density of the newly formed radiation becomes equal to the energy density of the inflaton, i.e., $\\rho_r(a_{rh}) = \\rho_\\phi(a_{rh})$. This transition marks the beginning of the hot Big Bang era.\n\nThe curvature density parameter is defined as $\\Omega_k = -k/(aH)^2$, where $k$ is the constant curvature index. The amplification of this parameter during reheating is given by the ratio $A = |\\Omega_k(a_{rh})|/|\\Omega_k(a_{end})|$. The Friedmann equation relates the total energy density to the Hubble parameter: $H^2 = \\frac{8\\pi G}{3}(\\rho_\\phi + \\rho_r)$.

The amplification factor $A$ is the ratio of its value at the end of reheating ($a=a_{rh}, H=H_{rh}$) to its value at the end of inflation ($a=a_{end}, H=H_{end}$).\n$$\nA = \\frac{|\\Omega_k(a_{rh})|}{|\\Omega_k(a_{end})|} = \\frac{|k|}{(a_{rh}H_{rh})^2} \\frac{(a_{end}H_{end})^2}{|k|} = \\left(\\frac{a_{end}H_{end}}{a_{rh}H_{rh}}\\right)^2\n$$\nDuring the reheating phase, the expansion is dominated by the inflaton condensate, which behaves like matter ($\\rho_\\phi \\propto a^{-3}$). The Friedmann equation, $H^2 \\propto \\rho_\\phi$, implies $H^2 \\propto a^{-3}$, so $H \\propto a^{-3/2}$. We can write the Hubble parameter at a scale factor $a$ as:\n$$\nH(a) = H_{end}\\left(\\frac{a}{a_{end}}\\right)^{-3/2}\n$$\nTherefore, at the end of reheating, $H_{rh} = H_{end}\\left(\\frac{a_{rh}}{a_{end}}\\right)^{-3/2}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $A$:\n$$\nA = \\left(\\frac{a_{end}H_{end}}{a_{rh} H_{end}(a_{rh}/a_{end})^{-3/2}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{a_{end}}{a_{rh}} \\left(\\frac{a_{rh}}{a_{end}}\\right)^{3/2}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\left(\\frac{a_{rh}}{a_{end}}\\right)^{1/2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{a_{rh}}{a_{end}}\n$$\nLet's define the scale factor ratio $x_{rh} = a_{rh}/a_{end}$. Thus, the amplification factor is $A = x_{rh}$. The problem states $A=4$, so we must have $x_{rh}=4$.\n\n**Step 2: Solve the equation for the radiation energy density $\\rho_r$**\n\nThe evolution of the radiation energy density $\\rho_r$ is given by $\\dot{\\rho}_r + 4H\\rho_r = \\beta H^4$.

The homogeneous solution is $\\rho_{h} \\propto a^{-4}$. For the particular solution, we can use the method of undetermined coefficients, guessing a solution of the form $\\rho_p = D a^{-9/2}$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$\na\\left(-\\frac{9}{2} D a^{-11/2}\\right) + 4(D a^{-9/2}) = -\\frac{9}{2}D a^{-9/2} + 4D a^{-9/2} = -\\frac{1}{2}D a^{-9/2}\n$$\nWe require this to be equal to the right-hand side, $\\beta H_{end}^3 a_{end}^{9/2} a^{-9/2}$.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{2}D = \\beta H_{end}^3 a_{end}^{9/2} \\implies D = -2\\beta H_{end}^3 a_{end}^{9/2}\n$$\nThe general solution is $\\rho_r(a) = C_1 a^{-4} - 2\\beta H_{end}^3 a_{end}^{9/2} a^{-9/2}$. We fix the constant $C_1$ using the initial condition $\\rho_r(a_{end})=0$.\n$$\n0 = C_1 a_{end}^{-4} - 2\\beta H_{end}^3 a_{end}^{9/2} a_{end}^{-9/2} \\implies C_1 = 2\\beta H_{end}^3 a_{end}^4\n$$\nSo the full solution for the radiation energy density is:\n$$\n\\rho_r(a) = 2\\beta H_{end}^3 a_{end}^4 a^{-4} - 2\\beta H_{end}^3 a_{end}^{9/2} a^{-9/2} = 2\\beta H_{end}^3 \\left[ \\left(\\frac{a_{end}}{a}\\right)^4 - \\left(\\frac{a_{end}}{a}\\right)^{9/2} \\right]\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Apply the reheating condition**\n\nReheating ends when $\\rho_r(a_{rh}) = \\rho_\\phi(a_{rh})$. The inflaton energy density is $\\rho_\\phi(a) = \\rho_\\phi(a_{end})\\left(\\frac{a}{a_{end}}\\right)^{-3}$.
