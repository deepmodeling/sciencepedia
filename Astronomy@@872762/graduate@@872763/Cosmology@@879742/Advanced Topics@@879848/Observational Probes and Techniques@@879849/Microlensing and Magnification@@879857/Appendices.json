For a simple point-mass lens, the geometry of this phenomenon can be described using normalized units.\n\nLet the angular position of the source relative to the lens be $\\beta$, and the angular position of an image be $\\theta$. These are normalized by the Einstein radius, $\\theta_E$, to define the dimensionless source position $u = \\beta/\\theta_E$ and image position $x = \\theta/\\theta_E$. The relationship between the source and image positions along the axis connecting them is given by the one-dimensional, normalized lens equation:\n$$u = x - \\frac{1}{x}$$\nFor any given source position $u  0$, this equation yields two distinct image positions, denoted by $x_+$ and $x_-$.\n\nThe magnification of a single image, $i$, is given by the formula:\n$$\\mu_i = \\left| \\frac{x_i^4}{x_i^4 - 1} \\right|$$\nThe total magnification, $\\mu_{tot}$, is the sum of the absolute magnifications of the two individual images, $\\mu_{tot} = \\mu_+ + \\mu_-$.\n\nConsider a microlensing event where the source moves along a straight path relative to the lens-observer line of sight.

This lensing effect can cause the apparent brightness of the source to be magnified.
