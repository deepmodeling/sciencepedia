[@problem_id:877421]", "problem": "The Hubble tension represents a significant discrepancy between the value of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, measured from the early universe via the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and its value measured from the late universe using local distance indicators like Type Ia supernovae. One proposed theoretical resolution involves modifying the nature of dark energy, replacing the cosmological constant ($\\Lambda$, with equation of state parameter $w=-1$) with a \"phantom\" dark energy component characterized by a constant equation of state parameter $w  -1$.\n\nThis problem explores this possibility within a simplified framework. Consider a family of flat Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmological models containing radiation, matter (baryonic and dark), and a dark energy component with a constant equation of state parameter $w$. The expansion rate is described by the Hubble parameter $H(z)$, where $z$ is the redshift. It is convenient to use the dimensionless Hubble parameter $h$, defined by $H_0 = 100h \\text{ km s}^{-1} \\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, and the physical density parameters $\\omega_i = \\Omega_i h^2$, where $\\Omega_i$ are the standard density fractions at $z=0$.\n\nThe Friedmann equation can be written as:\n$$H(z)^2 = (100 \\text{ km s}^{-1} \\text{Mpc}^{-1})^2 \\left[ \\omega_r(1+z)^4 + \\omega_m(1+z)^3 + (h^2 - \\omega_m - \\omega_r)(1+z)^{3(1+w)} \\right]$$\nwhere we have enforced spatial flatness ($\\Omega_k=0$, so $\\Omega_m + \\Omega_r + \\Omega_{DE} = 1$).\n\nA key observable from the CMB is the angular size of the sound horizon at recombination ($z=z_*$), $\\theta_s = r_s/D_A(z_*)$. The sound horizon $r_s$ depends on pre-recombination physics and is determined by $\\omega_m$ and the physical baryon density $\\omega_b$. The comoving angular diameter distance to the last-scattering surface, $D_A(z_*)$, is given by:\n$$D_A(z_*) = c \\int_0^{z_*} \\frac{dz'}{H(z')}$$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nTo resolve the Hubble tension, a new model must match the late-universe value of $H_0$ while preserving the early-universe CMB observables. We assume that the physical densities $\\omega_m$ and $\\omega_r$, and thus the sound horizon $r_s$, are fixed by early universe physics. Therefore, to keep $\\theta_s$ constant, the angular diameter distance $D_A(z_*)$ must also remain unchanged between different cosmological models.\n\nLet's denote the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model that fits the Planck CMB data with parameters $(h_P, w=-1)$ and the proposed phantom energy model that fits the local SH0ES data with parameters $(h_S, w  -1)$. The condition to reconcile the measurements is $D_A(z_*; h_P, w=-1) = D_A(z_*; h_S, w)$.\n\nFor this problem, we will neglect the contribution of radiation to the expansion history for the calculation of $D_A(z_*)$, as it is subdominant over most of the integration range. Further, assume that a detailed analysis of the resulting integral shows that for the range of parameters of interest, the comoving angular diameter distance to recombination, $D_A(z_*)$, can be approximated by the following analytical form:\n$$D_A(h, w) \\approx \\frac{K}{\\sqrt{h^2 - \\omega_m}} (-w)^{1/2}$$\nwhere $K$ is a constant that depends on $\\omega_m$ and fundamental constants, but not on $h$ or $w$.\n\nGiven the fixed physical matter density $\\omega_m$, a Hubble parameter $h_P$ from the CMB analysis, and a larger Hubble parameter $h_S$ from local measurements ($h_S  h_P$), determine the required value of the phantom energy equation of state parameter $w$ that would make the two measurements consistent under the assumptions stated above.

In the framework of Horndeski gravity, the most general scalar-tensor theory with second-order equations of motion, the propagation of GWs can be modified.
