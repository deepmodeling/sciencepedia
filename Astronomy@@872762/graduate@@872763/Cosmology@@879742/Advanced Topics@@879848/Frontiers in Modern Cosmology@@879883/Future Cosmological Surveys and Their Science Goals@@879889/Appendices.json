Understanding and quantifying such biases is a fundamental skill for interpreting data from next-generation surveys.", "problem": "The growth rate of structure, $f$, is a key cosmological parameter that can be constrained by peculiar velocity surveys.

In practice, we observe galaxies, not the raw matter distribution. The galaxy density contrast, $\\delta_g$, is biased with respect to the matter density, $\\delta_g = b_g \\delta_m$, where $b_g$ is the effective galaxy bias. Thus, comparing velocity and galaxy density fields allows a measurement of the parameter combination $\\beta = f/b_g$.\n\nTo extract $f$ from a measurement of $\\beta$, one needs an independent model for $b_g$. The effective galaxy bias is the average of the individual halo bias function, $b(M)$, weighted by the halo mass function (HMF), $n(M)$, which describes the number density of dark matter halos of mass $M$.\n\nConsider a cosmological analysis where an observer has a perfect measurement of $\\beta = f_{\\text{true}}/b_{g, \\text{true}}$.
