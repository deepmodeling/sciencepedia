We consider a universe described by a matter-dominated Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) cosmology, where the Hubble parameter is $H(z) = H_0 (1+z)^{3/2}$.\n\nReionization is driven by ionizing photons emitted from galaxies residing in dark matter halos. The abundance of these halos is described by the Press-Schechter formalism.

This exercise investigates the impact of X-ray heating from sources like high-mass X-ray binaries, focusing on the phenomenon of \"spectral hardening,\" where lower-energy photons are preferentially absorbed. By calculating the resulting \"heating boost factor\" ([@problem_id:806864]), you will explore how this radiative transfer effect creates spatial fluctuations in the gas kinetic temperature, a key ingredient for predicting the 21cm power spectrum.", "problem": "During the Epoch of Reionization (EOR), the first luminous sources, such as High-Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs), emitted high-energy photons that began to heat and ionize the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM). The 21cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen serves as a key observational probe of this era. The intensity of the 21cm signal depends on the hydrogen spin temperature, $T_S$, which is determined by a competition between coupling to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature $T_\\gamma$, collisional coupling, and Lyman-$\\alpha$ coupling (the Wouthuysen-Field effect) to the gas kinetic temperature, $T_K$.\n\nX-rays from sources like HMXBs are crucial for heating the IGM, raising $T_K$ above $T_\\gamma$ over large volumes and driving the global 21cm signal into emission. The heating rate of the IGM gas is proportional to the energy deposited by photoelectrons, which are produced when X-ray photons ionize atoms (primarily hydrogen). As a beam of X-ray photons traverses the IGM, the lower-energy photons are preferentially absorbed due to the energy dependence of the photoionization cross-section. This \"spectral hardening\" means that the average energy of the photons that penetrate deep into the IGM is higher than the average energy of the emitted photons. Consequently, the average energy deposited as heat per photoionization, $\\langle E_h \\rangle$, increases with the traversed hydrogen column density, $N_H$. This effect introduces spatial fluctuations in the IGM temperature, which in turn source fluctuations in the 21cm brightness temperature and its power spectrum.\n\nConsider a simplified model for this process. A population of HMXBs emits an X-ray flux with a luminosity spectrum (energy per unit time per unit energy) given by a power law, $L_E \\propto E^{-\\alpha}$, for photon energies $E$ above the hydrogen ionization threshold, $E_0$. These X-rays travel through a uniform, neutral hydrogen gas. The photoionization cross-section for hydrogen is modeled as $\\sigma_{HI}(E) = \\sigma_0 (E_0/E)^\\beta$, where $\\sigma_0$ is the cross-section at the ionization threshold. The energy deposited as heat by a primary photoelectron produced by a photon of energy $E$ is a fraction $f_h$ of the electron's initial kinetic energy, i.e., $f_h(E-E_0)$.\n\nTo quantify the impact of spectral hardening on IGM heating, we define a \"heating boost factor\", $\\mathcal{B}(N_H)$, as the ratio of the average energy deposited as heat per primary photoionization for a flux that has traversed a hydrogen column density $N_H$, to the same quantity in the optically thin limit ($N_H \\to 0$):\n$$\n\\mathcal{B}(N_H) = \\frac{\\langle E_h \\rangle(N_H)}{\\langle E_h \\rangle(N_H \\to 0)}\n$$\nFor analytical tractability, you are to assume the spectral index of the source luminosity is $\\alpha=2$, the power-law index for the cross-section is $\\beta=1$, and the X-ray spectrum extends from $E_{min}=E_0$ to $E_{max} \\to \\infty$.\n\nCalculate the heating boost factor, $\\mathcal{B}$, as a function of the hydrogen column density $N_H$ and the cross-section at the ionization threshold $\\sigma_0$.", "solution": "We seek \n\n$$\n\\mathcal{B}(N_H)\\;=\\;\\frac{\\langle E_h\\rangle(N_H)}{\\langle E_h\\rangle(N_H\\to0)}\\,,\n$$\n\nwhere \n\n$$\n\\langle E_h\\rangle(N_H)\n=\\frac{\\int_{E_0}^\\infty L_E\\,e^{-N_H\\sigma(E)}\\,\\sigma(E)\\,f_h\\,(E-E_0)\\,dE}\n     {\\int_{E_0}^\\infty L_E\\,e^{-N_H\\sigma(E)}\\,\\sigma(E)\\,dE}\\,,\n$$\n\nand in the optically thin limit \n$\\langle E_h\\rangle(0)=f_h\\,E_0$.\n\nFor $L_E\\propto E^{-2}$, $\\sigma(E)=\\sigma_0(E_0/E)$, and constant $f_h$, define \n\n$$\nA\\equiv N_H\\,\\sigma_0\\,E_0,\\quad u\\equiv\\frac{A}{E_0}=N_H\\,\\sigma_0.\n$$\n\nThe denominator integral is\n\n$$\nI_0=\\int_{E_0}^\\infty E^{-3}e^{-A/E}dE\n=A^{-2}\\int_0^u x\\,e^{-x}dx\n=A^{-2}\\bigl[1-(u+1)e^{-u}\\bigr].\n$$\n\nThe numerator integral (for the un-normalized heating) is\n\n$$\nI_1=\\int_{E_0}^\\infty E^{-2}e^{-A/E}dE\n=A^{-1}\\int_0^u e^{-x}dx\n=A^{-1}\\bigl[1-e^{-u}\\bigr].\n$$\n\nThus\n\n$$\n\\langle E_h\\rangle(N_H)\n=f_h\\,\\frac{I_1-E_0\\,I_0}{I_0}\n=f_h\\,E_0\\;\\frac{u(1-e^{-u})-\\bigl[1-(u+1)e^{-u}\\bigr]}\n                     {1-(u+1)e^{-u}}.\n$$\n\nSince $\\langle E_h\\rangle(0)=f_hE_0$, the boost factor is\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{B}(N_H)\n=\\frac{u-1+e^{-u}}{1-(u+1)e^{-u}},\n\\qquad u=N_H\\sigma_0.\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\mathcal{B}(N_H)\\;=\\;\\frac{N_H\\sigma_0-1+e^{-N_H\\sigma_0}}\n                     {1-\\bigl(N_H\\sigma_0+1\\bigr)e^{-N_H\\sigma_0}}\n}\n$$", "id": "806864"}, {"introduction": "The re-emergence of a plasma-filled universe during reionization leaves an indelible mark on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).

This process damps the primordial anisotropies and introduces new, secondary anisotropies, most notably through the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect.\n\nThe kSZ effect arises from the Doppler shift of CMB photons scattering off electrons with a non-zero peculiar velocity. In the standard cosmological model, the baryon peculiar velocity field on large scales is sourced by the same primordial density fluctuations that give rise to the large-scale structure of the universe.
