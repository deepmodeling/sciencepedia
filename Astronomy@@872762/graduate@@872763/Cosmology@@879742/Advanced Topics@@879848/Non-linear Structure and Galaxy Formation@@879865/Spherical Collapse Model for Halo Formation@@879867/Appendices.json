This scenario mimics the effect of baryons cooling and forming a galaxy at the center of a dark matter halo. You will apply the principle of adiabatic invariance to calculate how the collisionless halo contracts in response to the central concentration of mass, providing a more realistic picture of halo structure [@problem_id:849365].", "problem": "An advanced model for cosmic structure formation considers a composite dark matter halo. This halo has a total mass $M$ and forms from a spherical top-hat overdensity in an Einstein-de Sitter universe. The halo is composed of two components: a standard, collisionless Cold Dark Matter (CDM) component with mass fraction $(1-f_d)$, and a sub-dominant, dissipative Dark Matter (dDM) component with mass fraction $f_d \\ll 1$.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, we model the formation process in two conceptual stages:\n1.  Initially, the entire overdensity collapses and virializes to form a spherical halo of radius $R_0$. You may assume this initial halo has a uniform density and that the CDM and dDM components are well-mixed within it.\n2.  Following this, the dDM component cools efficiently via a hypothetical \"dark Bremsstrahlung\" process. This allows it to lose energy and collapse towards the center of the halo. It is assumed to have sufficient angular momentum to settle into a stable, compact, rotationally-supported disk. For its effect on the CDM halo, you can approximate this disk as a point mass $M_d = f_d M$ located at the halo's center.\n\nThe contraction of the dDM component happens slowly compared to the orbital periods of the CDM particles. Consequently, the CDM component of the halo responds by contracting adiabatically to the deepening gravitational potential. The evolution of a CDM particle's orbit during this process is governed by the adiabatic invariant for circular orbits, $r M_{enc}(r) = \\text{const}$, where $r$ is the orbital radius and $M_{enc}(r)$ is the total mass enclosed within that radius.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the final half-mass radius of the CDM component, $r_{c,f,1/2}$, to its initial half-mass radius in the uniform halo, $r_{c,i,1/2}$.
