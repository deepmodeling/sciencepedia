The relation is $A_V = R_V E(B-V)$.\n\nIn addition to extinction and reddening, interstellar dust grains can align with interstellar magnetic fields, causing starlight passing through the dust to become linearly polarized.

Their utility stems from the Period-Luminosity (P-L) relationship, which connects their pulsation period, $P$, to their intrinsic time-averaged luminosity, $\\bar{L}$, or equivalently, their time-averaged absolute magnitude, $\\bar{M}$. An astronomer can measure the period of a distant Cepheid, infer its $\\bar{M}$ from the known P-L relation, and then measure its time-averaged apparent magnitude, $\\bar{m}$. The luminosity distance, $d$, can then be calculated using the distance modulus equation:\n$$\n\\bar{m} - \\bar{M} = 5 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{d}{D_0}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $D_0$ is a reference distance of 10 parsecs. The magnitude scale is logarithmic, where the flux $F$ received from a source is related to its apparent magnitude $m$ by $F \\propto 10^{-m/2.5}$. Consequently, fluxes from multiple sources add linearly, while their magnitudes do not.\n\n**Problem:**\nAn astronomer observes a star system that is presumed to be a single Cepheid variable. The pulsation period is measured, and from the established P-L relation, the Cepheid's time-averaged absolute magnitude is determined to be $\\bar{M}_{ceph}$. The astronomer also measures the time-averaged apparent magnitude of the unresolved system, $\\bar{m}_{obs}$, and calculates an inferred luminosity distance, $d_{inf}$, under the assumption that the system consists only of the Cepheid.\n\nHowever, the system is, in fact, an unresolved binary, composed of the Cepheid and a stable, non-variable companion star. The companion has a constant absolute magnitude of $M_{comp}$. The presence of this companion contaminates the light, causing the measured apparent magnitude $\\bar{m}_{obs}$ to be that of the combined system, not the Cepheid alone.\n\nLet the true luminosity distance to the binary system be $d_{true}$. Define the difference in absolute magnitude between the companion and the Cepheid's mean as $\\Delta M = M_{comp} - \\bar{M}_{ceph}$. For this problem, assume the companion is fainter than the Cepheid's average brightness (i.e., $\\Delta M > 0$).\n\nCalculate the fractional error, $\\epsilon = (d_{inf} - d_{true}) / d_{true}$, in the inferred luminosity distance as a function of $\\Delta M$.", "solution": "**1.
