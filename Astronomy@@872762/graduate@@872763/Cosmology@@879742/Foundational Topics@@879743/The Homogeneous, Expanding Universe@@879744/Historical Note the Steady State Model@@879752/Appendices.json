To maintain this constant density in an expanding universe, the model postulates the continuous creation of matter.\n\nThe expansion is characterized by a constant Hubble parameter, $H_0$, leading to an exponential form for the scale factor, $a(t) \\propto e^{H_0 t}$. The continuous creation of new galaxies ensures that their number density $n_0$ remains constant despite the expansion. Consequently, at any given epoch, an observer would see a mixture of galaxies with a wide range of ages, from newly formed to very old.\n\nAssuming that once a galaxy is formed, it persists indefinitely, its \"removal\" from an observer's local sample within a fixed proper volume is due to the cosmic expansion carrying it away.
