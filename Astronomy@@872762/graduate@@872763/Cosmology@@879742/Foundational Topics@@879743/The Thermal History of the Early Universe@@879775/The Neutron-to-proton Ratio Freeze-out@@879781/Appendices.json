This practice guides you through an end-to-end derivation, starting from first principles within a simplified but powerful model.

This problem asks you to derive the Helium-4 mass fraction, $Y_p$, based on a simplified model of the early universe.\n\n**Background and Model Assumptions:**\n1.  In the early, radiation-dominated universe, the Hubble expansion rate as a function of temperature $T$ is given by the simplified relation:\n    $$ H(T) = A T^2 $$\n    where $A$ is a constant that encapsulates fundamental constants like the gravitational constant $G$ and the number of relativistic particle species.\n\n2.  The weak interactions that interconvert neutrons ($n$) and protons ($p$), such as $n + \\nu_e \\leftrightarrow p + e^-$, have a total rate given by the model:\n    $$ \\Gamma_{n \\leftrightarrow p}(T) = B T^5 $$\n    where $B$ is a constant determined by the strength of the weak force.\n\n3.  The neutron-to-proton ratio \"freezes out\" when the weak interaction rate becomes equal to the Hubble expansion rate. The temperature at which this occurs is the freeze-out temperature, $T_f$.\n\n4.  For temperatures $T \\ge T_f$, neutrons and protons are in thermal equilibrium, and their number density ratio is given by the Boltzmann factor:\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{n}{p}\\right)_{\\text{eq}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Q}{k_B T}\\right) $$\n    where $Q = (m_n - m_p)c^2$ is the rest-mass energy difference between a neutron and a proton, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. At freeze-out, the ratio $(n/p)_f$ is fixed to this equilibrium value at $T=T_f$.\n\n5.  After freeze-out, free neutrons decay with a mean lifetime $\\tau_n$. Nucleosynthesis, the formation of light elements, is delayed by the \"deuterium bottleneck\" and begins at a time $\\Delta t$ after the moment of freeze-out. The neutron-to-proton ratio at the onset of nucleosynthesis, $(n/p)_{nuc}$, is related to the ratio at freeze-out by:\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{n}{p}\\right)_{nuc} = \\left(\\frac{n}{p}\\right)_f \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_n}\\right) $$\n\n6.
