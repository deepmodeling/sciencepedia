At temperatures well above $1 \\text{ MeV}$, weak interactions like $n + \\nu_e \\leftrightarrow p + e^-$ are in equilibrium, and the ratio is given by the Boltzmann factor $(n_n/n_p)_{\\text{eq}} = \\exp(-Q/T)$, where $Q = m_n - m_p$ is the neutron-proton mass difference (in energy units), and we use units where $k_B=1$.\n\nAs the universe expands and cools, the weak interaction rate $\\Gamma$ drops. Freeze-out occurs when this rate becomes comparable to the Hubble expansion rate $H(T)$, fixing the $n_n/n_p$ ratio. In the radiation-dominated era, the Hubble rate is $H(T) = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi^3 G}{45} g_*(T)} T^2$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $g_*(T)$ is the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom for energy density. The total weak interaction rate for $n \\leftrightarrow p$ conversion is approximately $\\Gamma(T) = A T^5$ for a constant $A$.\n\nThis standard picture is modified by thermal effects from quantum field theory. In the hot plasma of the early universe, the electron acquires a thermal mass. To leading order in the fine-structure constant $\\alpha$, the effective electron mass squared is given by $m_{e, \\text{eff}}^2(T) = m_{e,0}^2 + \\delta m_e^2(T)$, where $m_{e,0}$ is the vacuum mass and the thermal correction is $\\delta m_e^2(T) = \\frac{\\pi \\alpha}{9} T^2$.\n\nThis change in electron mass affects the freeze-out temperature $T_f$ by modifying $g_*(T)$. The function $g_*(T)$ can be written as $g_*(T) = g_{\\text{other}} + g_{*e}(m_e/T)$, where $g_{\\text{other}}$ is the contribution from photons and neutrinos, and $g_{*e}$ is the contribution from electrons and positrons, which depends on the ratio of the electron mass to the temperature.\n\nAssume the unperturbed freeze-out temperature is $T_f^{(0)}$, and at this temperature, the ratio $y_0 = m_{e,0}/T_f^{(0)}$ is of order one.
