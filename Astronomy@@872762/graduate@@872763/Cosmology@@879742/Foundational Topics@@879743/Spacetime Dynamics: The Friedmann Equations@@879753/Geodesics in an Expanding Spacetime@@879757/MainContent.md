## Introduction
In Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, gravity is not a force but a manifestation of [curved spacetime](@entry_id:184938). In this landscape, particles and light, when free from other influences, follow the straightest possible paths, known as geodesics. In the context of cosmology, where the fabric of spacetime is not static but dynamically expanding, understanding these paths is paramount. The study of geodesics provides the fundamental link between the theoretical geometry of the universe and the light we observe from distant galaxies, enabling us to decipher the cosmos's history, structure, and ultimate fate. This article addresses the essential question: How do particles and photons move through an expanding universe, and what can their trajectories tell us?

This article provides a comprehensive exploration of [geodesic motion](@entry_id:189631) in an [expanding spacetime](@entry_id:161389), structured across three key chapters. In "Principles and Mechanisms," we will establish the foundational concepts, proving that observers carried by the cosmic expansion are in free-fall and deriving the crucial law of momentum decay that governs [cosmological redshift](@entry_id:152343). Next, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" will demonstrate how these principles are applied to measure cosmic distances, map the distribution of matter, understand [relativistic kinematics](@entry_id:159064), and reveal the [causal structure](@entry_id:159914) of the universe, culminating in the profound implications for its singular origin. Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will offer a series of guided problems to solidify your understanding of the relationship between [cosmic expansion](@entry_id:161002), time, and [redshift](@entry_id:159945) in different [cosmological models](@entry_id:161416).

## Principles and Mechanisms

The dynamics of the cosmos, as described by the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, are fundamentally governed by the principles of general relativity. In this framework, the trajectories of particles and photons not subject to non-gravitational forces are described by geodesics—the straightest possible paths through [curved spacetime](@entry_id:184938). Understanding the nature of these geodesics in an evolving, [expanding spacetime](@entry_id:161389) is paramount to interpreting cosmological observations and comprehending the universe's history and ultimate fate. This chapter will explore the fundamental principles of [geodesic motion](@entry_id:189631), from the status of comoving observers to the collective behavior of [geodesic congruences](@entry_id:160274).

### The Geodesic Principle in an Expanding Universe

At the heart of cosmology is the concept of the **[comoving frame](@entry_id:266800)**, a coordinate system that expands along with the universe itself. Observers at rest in this frame, known as **comoving observers**, are carried along by the general expansion, or **Hubble flow**. A fundamental question is whether these observers are in a state of free-fall. In the language of relativity, are their worldlines geodesics?

To answer this, we consider the FLRW metric in [comoving coordinates](@entry_id:271238) $(t, r, \theta, \phi)$:
$$ ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + a(t)^2 \left( \frac{dr^2}{1-kr^2} + r^2 d\theta^2 + r^2 \sin^2\theta d\phi^2 \right) $$
Here, $t$ is cosmic time, $a(t)$ is the [scale factor](@entry_id:157673), and $k$ describes the [spatial curvature](@entry_id:755140). A [comoving observer](@entry_id:158168), by definition, has constant spatial coordinates $(r, \theta, \phi)$, so $dr = d\theta = d\phi = 0$. For such an observer, the [spacetime interval](@entry_id:154935) simplifies to $ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2$. This implies that their [proper time](@entry_id:192124) $\tau$ is identical to the cosmic time $t$, up to an integration constant. We can therefore parameterize their [worldline](@entry_id:199036) by $t$. Their four-velocity $U^\mu = dx^\mu / d\tau$ is then remarkably simple: $U^\mu = (1, 0, 0, 0)$, assuming units where $c=1$.

A path is a geodesic if it satisfies the **geodesic equation**:
$$ \frac{dU^\mu}{d\tau} + \Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta} U^\alpha U^\beta = 0 $$
where $\Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta}$ are the Christoffel symbols, encoding the geometry of spacetime. Since the [four-velocity](@entry_id:274008) of a [comoving observer](@entry_id:158168) is constant, the first term, $dU^\mu/d\tau$, vanishes. The equation reduces to a condition on the Christoffel symbols: $\Gamma^\mu_{00} U^0 U^0 = 0$, which simplifies to $\Gamma^\mu_{00} = 0$. A direct calculation based on the FLRW metric components reveals that all Christoffel symbols of the form $\Gamma^\mu_{00}$ are indeed zero, regardless of the specific function $a(t)$ or the value of $k$. This confirms a profound principle: the worldlines of comoving observers are [timelike geodesics](@entry_id:160134) [@problem_id:1488453]. This means that galaxies that simply follow the Hubble flow are in a state of perfect free-fall. The [expansion of the universe](@entry_id:160481) is not a force pushing them apart, but rather the natural, inertial motion of objects in a dynamic spacetime geometry.

The distinction between geodesic and non-[geodesic motion](@entry_id:189631) becomes clearer when we consider an observer attempting to defy the Hubble flow. Imagine an observer who wishes to maintain a constant **[proper distance](@entry_id:162052)**, $L$, from a nearby comoving galaxy. The [proper distance](@entry_id:162052) is the physical distance measured at a single instant of cosmic time, given by $L(t) = a(t)\chi$, where $\chi$ is the constant comoving coordinate separation. To keep $L$ constant as $a(t)$ increases, the observer must actively decrease their comoving coordinate separation $\chi(t) = L/a(t)$. This motion relative to the [comoving frame](@entry_id:266800) requires acceleration. For instance, in a [matter-dominated universe](@entry_id:158254) where $a(t) \propto t^{2/3}$, maintaining a fixed proper distance $L$ requires the observer to experience a proper [four-acceleration](@entry_id:273431) of magnitude $a_{prop} = |\ddot{a}/a| L = (2/9t^2)L$ [@problem_id:828655]. This acceleration is precisely what is needed to counteract the natural tendency of geodesics to separate due to [cosmic expansion](@entry_id:161002). An observer subject to such acceleration would feel a force, unlike a [comoving observer](@entry_id:158168) who feels nothing.

### Consequences of Geodesic Motion for Particles and Radiation

The geodesic nature of free-fall in an [expanding universe](@entry_id:161442) has direct and measurable consequences for the energy and momentum of particles moving through the cosmos. Any motion of a particle relative to its local [comoving frame](@entry_id:266800) is termed its **peculiar velocity**, defined as $\vec{v}_p(t) = a(t) \frac{d\vec{x}}{dt}$. This is the velocity that a local [comoving observer](@entry_id:158168) would measure. The corresponding physical peculiar momentum is $p_p = m v_p$ for a massive particle.

A key result from analyzing the [geodesic equations](@entry_id:264349) in an FRW background is that the physical peculiar momentum of any freely-streaming particle decays inversely with the scale factor:
$$ p_p(t) \propto \frac{1}{a(t)} $$
This "momentum [redshift](@entry_id:159945)" is a universal consequence of the stretching of spacetime.

#### The Cooling of the Universe

This momentum decay principle governs the [thermal evolution](@entry_id:755890) of the universe's contents.

For **massless particles** like photons, energy is proportional to momentum ($E=p_p c$). Therefore, the energy of a photon traveling through the cosmos decreases as $E \propto 1/a(t)$. This is the origin of the **[cosmological redshift](@entry_id:152343)**. A photon emitted at time $t_e$ with energy $E_e$ and observed at time $t_o$ with energy $E_o$ will have its energy redshifted such that $E_o/E_e = a(t_e)/a(t_o)$. The [redshift](@entry_id:159945) $z$ is defined by the fractional increase in wavelength, which corresponds to a fractional decrease in energy, leading to the fundamental relation:
$$ 1+z = \frac{\lambda_o}{\lambda_e} = \frac{E_e}{E_o} = \frac{a(t_o)}{a(t_e)} $$
For example, in a de Sitter universe, where expansion is exponential ($a(t) = \exp(Ht)$), a photon emitted at $t_e=1/H$ and observed at $t_o=3/H$ would have a [redshift](@entry_id:159945) $z$ given by $1+z = \exp(H(3/H)) / \exp(H(1/H)) = e^2$, resulting in $z = e^2-1$ [@problem_id:828699].

For **non-relativistic massive particles**, with momentum $p_p = m v_p$, the momentum decay implies that their peculiar velocities are damped by the expansion:
$$ v_p(t) \propto \frac{1}{a(t)} $$
This explains why the universe becomes more homogeneous on large scales over time; any initial peculiar motions are "redshifted away" by the [cosmic expansion](@entry_id:161002). A particle with a [peculiar velocity](@entry_id:157964) $v_1$ at a [redshift](@entry_id:159945) $z_1$ will have its velocity reduced to $v_2 = v_1 \frac{a(t_1)}{a(t_2)} = v_1 \frac{1+z_2}{1+z_1}$ at a later epoch with [redshift](@entry_id:159945) $z_2$ [@problem_id:828764]. This velocity damping has direct thermodynamic consequences. For a dilute gas of non-relativistic particles, the [effective temperature](@entry_id:161960) $T$ is proportional to the average kinetic energy, $\langle \frac{1}{2}m v_p^2 \rangle$. Since $\langle v_p^2 \rangle \propto a(t)^{-2}$, the temperature of a decoupled gas of massive particles cools as:
$$ T(t) \propto \frac{1}{a(t)^2} $$
This is a faster cooling rate than that of radiation (like the Cosmic Microwave Background), whose temperature cools as $T_\gamma \propto E_\gamma \propto 1/a(t)$ [@problem_id:828695].

#### Composition of Redshifts

In practice, the observed redshift of a distant galaxy is a composite effect. It includes the cosmological redshift due to the expansion of space between the source and the observer, as well as two special relativistic Doppler shifts arising from the peculiar motions of the source and the observer relative to their local comoving frames. The total observed [redshift](@entry_id:159945), $z_{obs}$, can be expressed as a product of these factors:
$$ 1+z_{obs} = (1+z_s)(1+z_c)(1+z_o) $$
Here, $1+z_c = a(t_o)/a(t_e)$ is the cosmological redshift factor. The terms $1+z_s$ and $1+z_o$ are the Doppler factors for the source and observer, respectively. For radial motion, these are given by the relativistic Doppler formula $\sqrt{(1+\beta)/(1-\beta)}$, where $\beta = v/c$. The sign of $\beta$ is positive for motion away from the other object and negative for motion towards it. For example, if a galaxy at cosmological redshift $z_c=2$ is receding from us with a [peculiar velocity](@entry_id:157964) $\beta_s = 1/3$ and we are moving towards it with $\beta_o = 1/5$, the total observed redshift is a combination of all three effects, requiring careful multiplication of the respective factors [@problem_id:828692].

### The Collective Behavior of Geodesics: Focusing and Expansion

While the study of a single geodesic describes the motion of a single test particle, the evolution of a fluid, a cloud of dust, or a beam of light is described by the collective behavior of a **congruence** of geodesics. The relative motion of nearby geodesics is described by the equation of **[geodesic deviation](@entry_id:160072)**.

In an expanding universe, the most immediate consequence of [geodesic deviation](@entry_id:160072) for comoving observers is the Hubble-Lemaître Law. The physical separation $L(t)$ between two nearby comoving geodesics with a constant coordinate separation $\Delta\chi$ is simply $L(t) = a(t)\Delta\chi$. The rate of change of this separation is $\dot{L} = \dot{a}\Delta\chi = (\dot{a}/a) (a\Delta\chi) = H(t)L(t)$, which is the Hubble-Lemaître Law. For a de Sitter universe, where $a(t) = \exp(Ht)$, the physical separation grows exponentially, $L(t) \propto \exp(Ht)$, illustrating how the [expansion of spacetime](@entry_id:161127) manifests as an accelerating separation of freely-falling observers [@problem_id:1859888].

#### The Raychaudhuri Equation

A more general and powerful tool for analyzing [geodesic congruences](@entry_id:160274) is the **Raychaudhuri equation**, which describes the evolution of the kinematic properties of the [congruence](@entry_id:194418). For a [congruence](@entry_id:194418) of [timelike geodesics](@entry_id:160134) parameterized by [proper time](@entry_id:192124) $\tau$ with tangent four-[velocity field](@entry_id:271461) $U^\mu$, the equation for the **[expansion scalar](@entry_id:266072)**, $\theta = \nabla_\mu U^\mu$, is:
$$ \frac{d\theta}{d\tau} = -R_{\mu\nu}U^\mu U^\nu - \frac{1}{3}\theta^2 - \sigma_{\mu\nu}\sigma^{\mu\nu} + \omega_{\mu\nu}\omega^{\mu\nu} $$
The [expansion scalar](@entry_id:266072) $\theta$ measures the fractional rate of change of the volume of an infinitesimal element of the fluid. A positive $\theta$ indicates expansion, while a negative $\theta$ indicates contraction. The condition for the [congruence](@entry_id:194418) to focus, or converge, is $d\theta/d\tau  0$. Each term on the right-hand side has a precise physical meaning:

*   **$-R_{\mu\nu}U^\mu U^\nu$ (Matter/Curvature):** This term represents the direct influence of local matter and energy on the congruence. Through the Einstein Field Equations, the Ricci tensor $R_{\mu\nu}$ is sourced by the stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$. For any [normal form](@entry_id:161181) of matter or energy (satisfying the Strong Energy Condition), the quantity $R_{\mu\nu}U^\mu U^\nu$ is non-negative. Consequently, the term $-R_{\mu\nu}U^\mu U^\nu$ is non-positive. This is the mathematical embodiment of the principle that **gravity is attractive**: the presence of matter-energy causes [timelike geodesics](@entry_id:160134) to converge [@problem_id:1828295].

*   **$-\frac{1}{3}\theta^2$ (Expansion/Contraction):** This kinematic term is independent of matter content and is purely a [self-interaction](@entry_id:201333) of the congruence. Being quadratic and negative, it shows that an existing expansion ($\theta > 0$) will decelerate, while an existing contraction ($\theta  0$) will accelerate. This term always drives the congruence towards focusing.

*   **$-\sigma_{\mu\nu}\sigma^{\mu\nu}$ (Shear):** The **shear tensor** $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ describes the tendency of an initially spherical element of the [congruence](@entry_id:194418) to distort into an [ellipsoid](@entry_id:165811). The term $\sigma_{\mu\nu}\sigma^{\mu\nu}$ represents the squared magnitude of the shear and is always non-negative. Therefore, the term $-\sigma_{\mu\nu}\sigma^{\mu\nu}$ is always non-positive. This means that **shear always promotes focusing**. The effect is so powerful that even in an empty region of spacetime ($R_{\mu\nu}=0$) with an initially static [congruence](@entry_id:194418) ($\theta=0$), the mere presence of non-zero shear will initiate collapse, causing the volume to decrease ($d\theta/d\tau  0$) as the shape distorts [@problem_id:1850940].

*   **$+\omega_{\mu\nu}\omega^{\mu\nu}$ (Vorticity):** The **[vorticity tensor](@entry_id:189621)** $\omega_{\mu\nu}$ measures the rotation of the congruence. Its squared magnitude, $\omega_{\mu\nu}\omega^{\mu\nu}$, is non-negative. Since this term enters the equation with a positive sign, **[vorticity](@entry_id:142747) opposes focusing**. It acts as a kind of "centrifugal" barrier against gravitational collapse.

#### The Focusing Theorem

The Raychaudhuri equation leads to one of the most powerful results in general relativity: the **Focusing Theorem**. By examining the equation, we can see that in any [congruence](@entry_id:194418) of [timelike geodesics](@entry_id:160134), the presence of matter ($R_{\mu\nu}U^\mu U^\nu \ge 0$), shear ($\sigma_{\mu\nu}\sigma^{\mu\nu} \ge 0$), or an initial state of expansion/contraction ($\theta \ne 0$) will contribute to focusing, i.e., making $d\theta/d\tau$ negative [@problem_id:1829794]. Only vorticity can counteract this tendency.

The theorem states that if the [vorticity](@entry_id:142747) is zero and the Strong Energy Condition holds, any initially converging [congruence](@entry_id:194418) ($\theta  0$) must focus to a caustic ($\theta \to -\infty$) in a finite [proper time](@entry_id:192124). This inexorable focusing of geodesics is the mathematical foundation of the **[singularity theorems](@entry_id:161318)** of Penrose and Hawking, which prove that under very general physical assumptions, spacetimes like our universe must contain singularities—points where the classical theory of general relativity breaks down. Thus, the simple principle of free-fall, when applied to the fabric of an [expanding universe](@entry_id:161442), leads not only to the observed Hubble flow and cooling of cosmic fluids but also points towards the limits of our current understanding of gravity at the universe's origin.
