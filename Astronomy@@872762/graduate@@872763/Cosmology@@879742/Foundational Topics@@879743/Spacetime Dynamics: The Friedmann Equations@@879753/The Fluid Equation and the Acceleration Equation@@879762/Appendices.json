Determine the value of this critical threshold, $w_{crit}$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the critical value $w_{crit}$ such that a bounce is possible for $w  w_{crit}$ in a closed ($k=+1$) universe filled with a single fluid with equation of state $p=w\\rho$. We need to apply the two conditions for a bounce.\n\nLet the scale factor and energy density at the moment of the bounce be $a_b$ and $\\rho_b$, respectively.\n\n**Step 1: Apply the first bounce condition ($\\dot{a}=0$)**\nThe first bounce condition is that the rate of change of the scale factor is zero at the bounce point. We apply this to the Friedmann equation:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\right)^2 = \\frac{8\\pi G}{3}\\rho - \\frac{1}{a^2} $$\nAt $a = a_b$, we have $\\dot{a} = 0$, so the left-hand side is zero.\n$$ 0 = \\frac{8\\pi G}{3}\\rho_b - \\frac{1}{a_b^2} $$\nWe can rearrange this equation to find the energy density required at the bounce:\n$$ \\frac{8\\pi G}{3}\\rho_b = \\frac{1}{a_b^2} $$\n$$ \\rho_b = \\frac{3}{8\\pi G a_b^2} $$\nSince $G > 0$ and the bounce occurs at a finite, positive scale factor $a_b > 0$, the required energy density $\\rho_b$ is necessarily positive. This is consistent with the physical requirement that $\\rho > 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the second bounce condition ($\\ddot{a}>0$)**\nThe second bounce condition is that the acceleration must be positive at the bounce point to reverse the contraction. We apply this to the acceleration equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\ddot{a}}{a} = -\\frac{4\\pi G}{3}(\\rho + 3p) $$\nAt $a = a_b$, we require $\\ddot{a} > 0$. Since $a_b > 0$, this is equivalent to requiring $\\frac{\\ddot{a}_b}{a_b} > 0$.\n$$ -\\frac{4\\pi G}{3}(\\rho_b + 3p_b) > 0 $$\n\n**Step 3: Incorporate the equation of state**\nWe now use the equation of state for the perfect fluid, $p = w\\rho$. At the bounce, this means $p_b = w\\rho_b$. Substituting this into the inequality from Step 2:\n$$ -\\frac{4\\pi G}{3}(\\rho_b + 3(w\\rho_b)) > 0 $$\n$$ -\\frac{4\\pi G}{3}\\rho_b(1 + 3w) > 0 $$\n\n**Step 4: Solve for the condition on $w$**\nWe have a product of three terms. Let's analyze their signs:\n1.  $-\\frac{4\\pi G}{3}$ is a negative constant.\n2.  $\\rho_b$ is the energy density at the bounce. From Step 1, we found $\\rho_b = \\frac{3}{8\\pi G a_b^2}$, which is positive.\n3.  $(1+3w)$ is the term containing the parameter we want to constrain.\n\nFor the entire expression to be positive, the product of these three terms must be positive.\n$$ (\\text{negative}) \\times (\\text{positive}) \\times (1 + 3w) > 0 $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ -(1 + 3w) > 0 $$\nMultiplying by -1 reverses the inequality sign:\n$$ 1 + 3w  0 $$\nNow, we solve for $w$:\n$$ 3w  -1 $$\n$$ w  -\\frac{1}{3} $$\n\nThis is the condition that $w$ must satisfy for a bounce to be possible. The problem defines $w_{crit}$ as the critical value such that the condition for a bounce is $w  w_{crit}$. By comparing our result with this definition, we can identify the critical value.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the critical value**\nThe condition for a bounce is $w  -1/3$. Therefore, the critical value is:\n$$ w_{crit} = -\\frac{1}{3} $$\nThis condition, $w  -1/3$, corresponds to the violation of the Strong Energy Condition ($\\rho + 3p \\ge 0$), which is a general requirement for gravity to be attractive. For a bounce to occur, a repulsive gravitational effect is needed, which is provided by fluids that violate the Strong Energy Condition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{3}}$$", "id": "873177"}]}
