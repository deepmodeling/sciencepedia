This coupling enforces a constant rotation period, $P_0$, on the star, by efficiently transferring angular momentum to the disk.\n\nAt a certain point in its evolution, when the star's radius has contracted to $R_0$, the accretion disk dissipates, and the magnetic lock is broken. From this moment onwards, the star is isolated and its total angular momentum is conserved as it continues to contract. This final phase of contraction proceeds until the star reaches its stable main-sequence radius, $R_f$. Assume that the polytropic index $n$, and thus the structure constant $k$, remains unchanged during this final contraction phase.\n\nDerive a symbolic expression for the final rotation period, $P_f$, of the star when it settles onto the main sequence.
