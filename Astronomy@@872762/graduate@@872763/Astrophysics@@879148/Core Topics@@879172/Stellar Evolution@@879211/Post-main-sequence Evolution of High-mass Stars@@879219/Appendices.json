This first exercise invites you to use stellar homology relations—a powerful tool for estimating how a star's global properties scale with its mass and composition. By applying these relations, you will derive the ratio of the helium-burning to hydrogen-burning lifetimes, revealing why the post-main-sequence phases are so fleeting compared to a star's time on the main sequence [@problem_id:253415].", "problem": "This problem concerns the estimation of stellar lifetimes for different nuclear burning stages in massive stars using homology relations.\n\n**Background:**\nThe lifetime of a star in a given nuclear burning stage is approximated by the total nuclear energy available, $E_{\\text{nuc}}$, divided by the rate at which it is radiated away, i.e., the star's luminosity $L$.\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{E_{\\text{nuc}}}{L}\n$$\nThe energy released per unit mass of hydrogen consumed in fusion is denoted by $\\mathcal{E}_H$, and the energy released per unit mass of helium consumed is $\\mathcal{E}_{He}$.

During the main sequence (core hydrogen-burning), the hydrogen within this core is converted to helium. The mass of the hydrogen fuel is thus $X M_c$. In the subsequent core helium-burning phase, the entire core, now composed of helium with mass $M_c$, serves as the fuel.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Scaling:** Assume the star's luminosity is governed by the homology relation for a radiation pressure-dominated star with constant opacity due to electron scattering: $L \\propto \\mu^4 M^3$, where $\\mu$ is the mean molecular weight of the stellar gas.\n\n3.  **Mean Molecular Weight:** For a fully ionized gas, the mean molecular weight $\\mu$ is given by the relation:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{\\mu} = 2X + \\frac{3}{4}Y + \\frac{1}{2}Z\n    $$\n    To estimate the luminosities during the two burning phases ($L_H$ and $L_{He}$), you are to model the star as being chemically homogeneous.

This process strips the primary star of its entire hydrogen-rich envelope, leaving behind a pure helium star, which is observed as a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star. This WR star continues to evolve, losing mass through a powerful stellar wind until it ends its life in a supernova explosion.\n\nWe wish to determine the final mass of this star, $M_f$, just before the supernova. To do this, we model its evolution from its initial mass, $M_0$, at the beginning of the WR phase.
