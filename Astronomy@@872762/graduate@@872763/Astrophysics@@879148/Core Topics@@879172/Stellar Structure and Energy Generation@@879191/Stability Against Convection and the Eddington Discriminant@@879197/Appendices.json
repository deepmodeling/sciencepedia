However, due to effects like partial ionization, the specific heat at constant pressure per unit mass, $c_P$, is not constant but varies linearly with temperature as $c_P(T) = c_0 + c_1 T$, where $c_0$ and $c_1$ are positive constants.\n\nThe change in specific entropy, $s$, can be related to changes in temperature and pressure via the general thermodynamic relation:\n$$T ds = c_P dT - T \\left(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial T}\\right)_P dP$$\nwhere $v=1/\\rho$ is the specific volume.\n\nFor a gas parcel undergoing an adiabatic (isentropic, $ds=0$) displacement starting from an initial state $(P_0, T_0)$, derive the expression for the pressure $P$ as a function of temperature $T$.
