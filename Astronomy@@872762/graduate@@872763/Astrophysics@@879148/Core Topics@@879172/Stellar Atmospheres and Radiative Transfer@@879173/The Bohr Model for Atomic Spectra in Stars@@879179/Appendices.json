This process is known as a radiative cascade.\n\nA crucial spectral line for diagnosing astrophysical environments is the Lyman-alpha (Ly-$\\alpha$) line, which corresponds to the transition from the $n=2$ state to the $n=1$ state.\n\nFor this problem, consider a simplified model of the radiative cascade in a hydrogen atom. Assume that the relative probability of an electron spontaneously transitioning from an initial state with principal quantum number $n$ to a final, lower state $m$ ($m < n$) is directly proportional to the Einstein A-coefficient, $A_{nm}$.
