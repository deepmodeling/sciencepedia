The parallax angle $p$, measured in arcseconds, is related to the distance $d$, measured in parsecs, by the simple inverse relation $d=1/p$.\n\nA single measurement of a star's parallax is not perfectly accurate but is subject to random errors. Let the true parallax of a star be $p_0$, which corresponds to a true distance $d_0 = 1/p_0$. An observational measurement yields a value $p$, which can be described as a random variable. The measurement process is unbiased, meaning the expectation value of the measurement is the true value, $E[p] = p_0$. The uncertainty of the measurement is characterized by its standard deviation, $\\sigma_p = \\sqrt{E[(p-p_0)^2]}$. We assume that the error distribution is symmetric about the mean, implying that all odd central moments are zero (i.e., $E[(p-p_0)^{2k+1}] = 0$ for integer $k \\ge 0$).\n\nAn astronomer calculates an estimated distance using the naive formula $d_\\text{est} = 1/p$. Because this formula involves a non-linear transformation of the measured quantity $p$, the expectation value of the estimated distance, $E[d_\\text{est}]$, will not be equal to the true distance $d_0$. This results in a systematic bias.\n\nAssuming the measurement uncertainty is small compared to the parallax itself (i.e., $\\sigma_p \\ll p_0$), derive the leading-order approximation for the expected fractional error in the distance estimate.
