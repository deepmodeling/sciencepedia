However, starlight is attenuated and \"reddened\" as it travels through the interstellar medium (ISM), a phenomenon known as interstellar extinction. To accurately determine a star's temperature from its color, one must first correct for this reddening. This correction relies on understanding the wavelength dependence of extinction.\n\nConsider a simplified model for interstellar extinction where the extinction in magnitudes at a wavelength $\\lambda$, denoted $A_\\lambda$, follows a power-law relationship:\n$$A_\\lambda = C \\lambda^{-\\beta}$$\nHere, $C$ is a constant proportional to the total amount of dust along the line of sight (but independent of wavelength), and $\\beta$ is a constant characterizing the average properties of the interstellar dust grains.\n\nIn the Johnson-Cousins UBV photometric system, measurements are taken in three specific wavelength bands: U (ultraviolet), B (blue), and V (visual), with effective wavelengths $\\lambda_U$, $\\lambda_B$, and $\\lambda_V$, respectively. The color index of a star, such as $(B-V)$, is the difference between its apparent magnitudes in the corresponding filters, $m_B - m_V$.

A common system uses the Ultraviolet (U), Blue (B), and Visual (V) filters, giving rise to the color indices $(B-V)$ and $(U-B)$. A two-color diagram, which plots $(U-B)$ versus $(B-V)$, is a powerful tool for classifying stars.\n\nFor main-sequence stars, their intrinsic (unreddened) colors, denoted $(B-V)_0$ and $(U-B)_0$, fall along a well-defined curve known as the main-sequence locus. For a certain range of stellar types, this locus can be accurately approximated by a straight line:\n$$ (U-B)_0 = m_s (B-V)_0 + c_s $$\nwhere $m_s$ is the slope and $c_s$ is the intercept of this linear approximation.\n\nLight from a distant star is subject to interstellar extinction and reddening, caused by dust between the star and the observer. This process makes the star appear fainter and redder than it truly is. The observed colors, $(B-V)_{obs}$ and $(U-B)_{obs}$, are related to the intrinsic colors via the color excesses, defined as $E(B-V) = (B-V)_{obs} - (B-V)_0$ and $E(U-B) = (U-B)_{obs} - (U-B)_0$.
