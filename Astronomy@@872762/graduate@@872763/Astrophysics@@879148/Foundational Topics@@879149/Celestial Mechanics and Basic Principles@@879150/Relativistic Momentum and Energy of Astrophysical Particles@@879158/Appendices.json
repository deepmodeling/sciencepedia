The detected energy of this photon will depend on its emission angle in the pion's rest frame relative to the direction of motion. This results in a continuous spectrum of possible photon energies in the lab frame, bounded by a minimum energy $E_{\\text{min}}$ and a maximum energy $E_{\\text{max}}$.\n\nDerive a closed-form expression for the ratio of the maximum to the minimum possible energy, $\\frac{E_{\\text{max}}}{E_{\\text{min}}}$, for a single decay photon as measured in the laboratory frame.
