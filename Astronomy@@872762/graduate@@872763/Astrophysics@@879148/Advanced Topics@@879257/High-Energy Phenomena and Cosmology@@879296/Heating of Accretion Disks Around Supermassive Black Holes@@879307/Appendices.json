This turbulence, in turn, can act as a dynamo, amplifying magnetic fields on small scales. The subsequent resistive dissipation of these magnetic fields provides a significant source of heating for the disk plasma, allowing it to radiate and accrete.\n\nConsider a simplified local model of an accretion disk with the following properties:\n1.  The MRI-driven turbulence is characterized by a typical velocity $v_t$ at the largest turbulent eddy scale, $L$.
