A simplified but powerful model for this process involves treating the accreting gas as a collection of non-interacting test particles spiraling inward within an accretion disk. As these particles move to smaller radii, they radiate away gravitational potential energy. This process continues until a particle reaches the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO), the smallest radius at which a stable circular trajectory is possible.
