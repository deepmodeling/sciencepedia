This practice challenges you to move beyond the abstract concept and calculate a tangible property of this unique orbit: its period as measured by a distant observer. By deriving the orbital period for a particle at the ISCO of a Schwarzschild black hole like Sgr A*, you will directly connect the geometry of spacetime to a fundamental timescale, reinforcing your understanding of orbital dynamics in the strong-gravity regime [@problem_id:362995].", "problem": "The supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), can be approximated as a non-rotating, uncharged black hole, described by the Schwarzschild metric. Test particles, such as stars or gas clouds, orbiting such a black hole follow trajectories dictated by the curvature of spacetime. According to General Relativity, for any massive test particle, there exists an Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO). Inside this radius, no stable circular orbits are possible, and the particle will inevitably spiral into the black hole.\n\nThe spacetime geometry outside a non-rotating black hole of mass $M$ is given by the Schwarzschild metric (in units where the gravitational constant is $G$ and the speed of light is $c$):\n$$\nds^2 = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{rc^2}\\right)c^2 dt^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{rc^2}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 \\left(d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2\\right)\n$$\nwhere $(t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$ are the Schwarzschild coordinates.

This exercise explores gravitational redshift, the phenomenon where light loses energy as it climbs out of a gravitational potential well.

However, such stable orbits only exist for radii greater than a critical value, known as the radius of the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO). The radial motion of a massive particle with specific angular momentum $\\tilde{L}$ (angular momentum per unit mass) is governed by an effective potential $V_{eff}(r)$.
