This first exercise models a pulsar as a two-component system: a solid crust coupled to a superfluid neutron interior. By applying the law of conservation of angular momentum, you will derive the magnitude of a glitch, linking observable parameters like the spin-down rate to the internal moments of inertia of the star [@problem_id:338169].", "problem": "A pulsar can be modeled as a two-component rotating object consisting of a solid crust and a neutron superfluid interior. The pulsar's rotation slows down over time due to magnetic dipole radiation, resulting in an observable angular frequency $\\Omega$ and a negative spin-down rate $\\dot{\\Omega}$. The characteristic spin-down age of the pulsar is defined as $\\tau = -\\frac{\\Omega}{2\\dot{\\Omega}}$.\n\nThe superfluid interior is only weakly coupled to the crust. As the crust's rotation slows, the superfluid component tends to maintain a higher angular velocity. This creates an angular velocity lag, $\\delta\\Omega$, between the superfluid and the crust. We can assume this lag increases at a rate equal to the magnitude of the crust's spin-down rate, i.e., $\\frac{d(\\delta\\Omega)}{dt} = |\\dot{\\Omega}|$.\n\nA \"glitch\" is a sudden event where a significant amount of angular momentum is transferred from the faster-rotating superfluid to the slower-rotating crust, causing an abrupt increase in the pulsar's observed spin frequency. Let's model this process.\n\nConsider a pulsar with a crust of moment of inertia $I_c$ and a superfluid component of moment of inertia $I_s$ that participates in the glitch. Just before a glitch, the crust rotates at angular frequency $\\Omega$, and the superfluid rotates at $\\Omega + \\delta\\Omega$. A glitch occurs after a time interval $\\Delta t$ has passed since the previous one. During this interval, a total lag of $\\delta\\Omega = |\\dot{\\Omega}|\\Delta t$ has accumulated. Assume that during the glitch, this entire accumulated lag is annihilated, meaning the superfluid and the crust are brought into co-rotation at a new, higher angular frequency $\\Omega_f = \\Omega + \\Delta\\Omega$.\n\nBased on the principle of conservation of angular momentum for the crust-superfluid system, derive an expression for the fractional frequency jump of the crust, $\\frac{\\Delta\\Omega}{\\Omega}$, in terms of the moments of inertia $I_c$ and $I_s$, the inter-glitch time interval $\\Delta t$, and the characteristic spin-down age $\\tau$.", "solution": "1.
