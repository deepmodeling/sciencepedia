The polytropic equation of state is a well-established and physically motivated simplification for dense matter. The causality condition and the chosen parameter ranges are consistent with the known physics of neutron stars.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem describes a complete procedure for a Monte Carlo simulation. It defines an initial value problem with specific initial conditions, a clear integration method (adaptive RK4), and unambiguous termination and failure criteria. The process for sampling input parameters and calculating output statistics is mathematically precise.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is formulated using objective, technical language. All quantities are defined, and all required parameters are given specific values or are described by probability distributions.\n4.  **Complete and Consistent:** The problem provides all necessary equations, constants, parameters for the physical model, numerical method, and statistical analysis. There are no apparent contradictions in the provided information. The note about $M_\\odot$ being dimensionless is slightly awkward but its intent is clear: the final mass is to be reported as a dimensionless ratio $m/M_\\odot$.\n5.  **Feasible and Realistic:** The physical and numerical parameters are within realistic ranges for this type of simulation. The computational task, while intensive, is feasible on a standard computer.\n6.  **Well-Structured:** The problem is logically structured, guiding the solver from fundamental principles (GR and EoS) through numerical implementation (TOV integration) to the final statistical analysis (UQ).\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a self-contained, scientifically sound, and well-posed problem in computational physics. A solution will be developed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution implements a Monte Carlo simulation to quantify the uncertainty in the maximum mass of a neutron star, arising from uncertainties in the equation of state (EoS). The core of the simulation involves repeatedly solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations.\n\nThe overall algorithm proceeds as follows for each test case:\n1.  **Parameter Sampling:** $N$ samples of the EoS parameters $(\\Gamma, P_{\\mathrm{ref}})$ are generated according to the specified probability distributions and random seed. $\\Gamma$ is drawn from a normal distribution and then clipped to the interval $[1.8, 2.0]$. $\\log_{10} P_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is drawn from a normal distribution to compute $P_{\\mathrm{ref}}$.\n2.  **Maximum Mass Calculation:** For each sampled EoS:\n    a.  The polytropic constant $K = P_{\\mathrm{ref}} / \\rho_{\\mathrm{ref}}^{\\Gamma}$ is computed.\n    b.  A predefined grid of $24$ central pressures, $P_c$, is constructed.\n    c.  For each $P_c$, the TOV equations are numerically integrated from a small initial radius $r_0$ outwards. This integration yields the mass-radius profile of a star for the given $P_c$ and EoS.\n    d.  The maximum mass for the EoS, $M_{\\max}^{(i)}$, is determined by finding the maximum final mass among all stable stellar structures computed across the $P_c$ grid. If an EoS sample fails to produce any stable stars, it is discarded.\n3.  **Statistical Analysis:** The sample mean ($\\bar{M}$) and sample standard deviation ($s$) of the collected $M_{\\max}^{(i)}$ values from all valid samples are calculated.\n\nThe numerical integration of the TOV system, which is a pair of coupled first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for pressure $P(r)$ and enclosed mass $m(r)$, is performed using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method. To handle the stiffness of the equations where pressure changes rapidly near the stellar surface, an adaptive step size $h$ is employed. The step size is calculated based on the local pressure scale height, $H = |P/(dP/dr)|$, and is constrained within a specified minimum and maximum range ($h_{\\min}, h_{\\max}$).\n\nThe integration for a single star begins at $r_0=10$ m with initial conditions derived assuming a uniform core density. The integration proceeds until the pressure drops below a surface threshold $P_{\\mathrm{surf}}$, at which point the integration stops. The final radius $R$ and mass $m(R)$ are determined by linear interpolation to the point where $P(r) = P_{\\mathrm{surf}}$ for greater accuracy. During integration, a critical check is performed at each step to ensure that the metric term $1 - 2Gm/rc^2$ remains positive. If it becomes non-positive, it signifies gravitational collapse to a black hole (in the context of this model), and the integration for that star is marked as a failure.\n\nThe implementation is encapsulated within a Python program, utilizing `numpy` for numerical operations and `scipy.stats` for generating random variates from a truncated normal distribution. Though the problem text can be interpreted as clamping, using `truncnorm` is statistically more robust. However, for direct fidelity to the phrasing \"then truncate\", clamping is implemented. The code is structured to process each test case sequentially, compute the required statistics, and format the final output as a single comma-separated list.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import truncnorm\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run the uncertainty quantification for all test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Physical Constants (SI units) ---\n    G = 6.67430e-11  # Gravitational constant\n    C = 2.99792458e8   # Speed of light\n    C2 = C**2\n    M_SUN = 1.98847e30 # Solar mass in kg\n\n    # --- EOS and Integration Parameters ---\n    RHO_REF = 2.8e17   # Reference rest-mass density (kg/m^3)\n    R_0 = 10.0         # Initial integration radius (m)\n    P_SURF = 1.0e30    # Surface pressure threshold (Pa)\n    H_MIN = 1.0        # Minimum step size (m)\n    H_MAX = 200.0      # Maximum step size (m)\n    ETA = 0.3          # Step size control factor\n    N_STEPS_MAX = 20000# Maximum number of integration steps\n\n    # Central pressure multipliers\n    PC_MULTIPLIERS = np.logspace(-0.30103, 1.30103, 24)\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # (N, mu_log10 P, sigma_log10 P, mu_Gamma, sigma_Gamma, seed)\n        (14, 34.6, 0.2, 1.95, 0.05, 1729),\n        (12, 34.4, 0.2, 1.90, 0.05, 2027),\n        (16, 34.8, 0.2, 1.98, 0.03, 123),\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n\n    for n_samples, mu_logp, sigma_logp, mu_gamma, sigma_gamma, seed in test_cases:\n\n        rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)\n\n        # Generate all random variables for the case at once\n        log_p_ref_samples = rng.normal(mu_logp, sigma_logp, n_samples)\n        p_ref_samples = 10.0**log_p_ref_samples\n        \n        gamma_samples_raw = rng.normal(mu_gamma, sigma_gamma, n_samples)\n        gamma_samples = np.clip(gamma_samples_raw, 1.8, 2.0)\n\n        max_masses = []\n\n        for i in range(n_samples):\n            gamma = gamma_samples[i]\n            p_ref = p_ref_samples[i]\n            \n            # Polytropic constant K\n            k_eos = p_ref / (RHO_REF**gamma)\n\n            masses_for_eos = []\n\n            for alpha in PC_MULTIPLIERS:\n                pc = alpha * p_ref\n\n                # --- Integration of a single star ---\n                r = R_0\n                \n                # Epsilon at center\n                if pc <= 0:\n                    # Non-physical central pressure\n                    masses_for_eos.append(None)\n                    continue\n\n                rho_c = (pc / k_eos)**(1.0 / gamma)\n                eps_c = rho_c * C2 + pc / (gamma - 1.0)\n                \n                # Initial conditions\n                p = pc\n                m = (4.0 / 3.0) * np.pi * r**3 * eps_c / C2\n                \n                y = np.array([p, m])\n\n                is_stable = True\n                for step in range(N_STEPS_MAX):\n                    # Check for black hole formation\n                    schwarzschild_term = 1.0 - 2.0 * G * y[1] / (r * C2)\n                    if schwarzschild_term <= 0:\n                        is_stable = False\n                        break\n\n                    # --- TOV ODE system ---\n                    rho = (y[0] / k_eos)**(1.0 / gamma) if y[0] > 0 else 0.0\n                    eps = rho * C2 + y[0] / (gamma - 1.0)\n                    \n                    dpdr = -(G * (eps + y[0]) * (y[1] + 4.0 * np.pi * r**3 * y[0] / C2)\n                           / (r**2 * C2 * schwarzschild_term))\n                    dmdr = 4.0 * np.pi * r**2 * eps / C2\n                    \n                    derivatives = np.array([dpdr, dmdr])\n\n                    # --- Adaptive step size ---\n                    if dpdr == 0:\n                        h = H_MAX\n                    else:\n                        h_pressure_scale = abs(y[0] / dpdr)\n                        h = ETA * h_pressure_scale\n                    \n                    h = np.clip(h, H_MIN, H_MAX)\n\n                    # --- RK4 step ---\n                    k1 = h * derivatives\n                    \n                    # Recalculate derivatives for k2, k3, k4\n                    p_k2 = y[0] + 0.5 * k1[0]\n                    m_k2 = y[1] + 0.5 * k1[1]\n                    r_k2 = r + 0.5 * h\n                    rho_k2 = (p_k2 / k_eos)**(1.0 / gamma) if p_k2 > 0 else 0.0\n                    eps_k2 = rho_k2 * C2 + p_k2 / (gamma - 1.0)\n                    schwarzschild_term_k2 = 1.0 - 2.0 * G * m_k2 / (r_k2 * C2)\n                    if schwarzschild_term_k2 <= 0: is_stable = False;
