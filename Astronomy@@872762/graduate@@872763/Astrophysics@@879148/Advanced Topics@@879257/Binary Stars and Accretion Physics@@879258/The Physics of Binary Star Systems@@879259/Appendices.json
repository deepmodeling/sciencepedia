This practice explores the core dynamics of conservative mass transfer, where the total mass and orbital angular momentum of the system are conserved. By analyzing the orbital response to mass exchange, you will derive the condition for the minimum orbital separation, which corresponds to the moment the donor star's mass equals its companion's, marking a turning point in the system's evolution and providing a key insight into resolving the famous Algol paradox [@problem_id:330449].", "problem": "A close binary system consists of two stars, star 1 and star 2, with initial masses $M_{1,i}$ and $M_{2,i}$ respectively, in a circular orbit. Star 1 is initially more massive than star 2 ($M_{1,i} > M_{2,i}$). As star 1 evolves and expands, it fills its Roche lobe, initiating a phase of rapid mass transfer to star 2. This process is assumed to be fully conservative, meaning the total mass of the system and its total orbital angular momentum are both conserved.\n\nThis rapid, or \"thermal-timescale,\" mass transfer is driven by the fact that for a donor more massive than its companion, the orbit tends to shrink. This orbital shrinkage causes the donor's Roche lobe to shrink as well, which can accelerate the mass loss in a runaway feedback loop. This phase of orbital shrinkage and runaway transfer is considered to conclude at the point where the orbital separation, $a$, reaches its minimum value. After this point, the orbit begins to expand with further mass transfer, leading to a potentially more stable configuration.\n\nDerive an expression for the final mass of the donor star, $M_{1,f}$, at the end of this rapid mass transfer phase, as defined by the moment of minimum orbital separation.
