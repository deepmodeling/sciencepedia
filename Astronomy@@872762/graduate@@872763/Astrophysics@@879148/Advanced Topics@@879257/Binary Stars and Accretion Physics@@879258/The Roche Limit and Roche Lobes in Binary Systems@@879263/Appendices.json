This foundational exercise encourages us to think about the Roche limit more generally as a balance of forces. By considering a hypothetical satellite held together only by internal tensile strength, we can isolate and analyze the nature of the disruptive tidal force itself, building a strong intuition for the underlying physical mechanism [@problem_id:353234].", "problem": "A small, spherical, rigid satellite of radius $r$ and uniform density $\\rho_s$ orbits a much larger primary body of mass $M$. The satellite is non-self-gravitating; its structural integrity is maintained solely by a uniform internal tensile strength, $\\sigma_T$. The tidal forces exerted by the primary body create internal stresses within the satellite. If the satellite gets too close to the primary, this tidal stress can exceed its tensile strength, causing it to disintegrate. This critical distance is known as the Roche limit.\n\nYour task is to derive the expression for this Roche limit, $d_R$, for this specific type of satellite.\n\nTo simplify the calculation, follow these steps:\n1.  Model the total disruptive tidal force as the force pulling apart two hemispheres of the satellite along the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers of the two bodies.\n2.  Calculate the net tidal force on the hemisphere closer to the primary body. This is done by integrating the differential gravitational force over the volume of that hemisphere.\n3.  Assume the distance $d$ between the centers of the bodies is much greater than the satellite's radius $r$ ($d \\gg r$), allowing for a first-order approximation of the tidal field.\n4.  The average stress across the dividing plane (area $\\pi r^2$) is this total tidal force divided by the area.\n5.  The Roche limit $d_R$ is the distance $d$ where this average stress equals the tensile strength $\\sigma_T$.\n\nYou are given that the center of mass of a solid hemisphere of radius $r$ is located at a distance of $\\frac{3}{8}r$ from its flat circular base.

This practice investigates how a satellite's stability against tidal disruption is affected by its internal differentiation, specifically the presence of a dense core within a lighter mantle.

The satellite's total mass is $M_s$.\n\nThe classical Roche limit for a *rigid* satellite, held together only by self-gravity, is derived by balancing the primary's tidal force with the satellite's gravitational attraction on a test mass at its surface. This yields the relation:\n$$ \\frac{2 G M_p R_s}{d^3} = \\frac{G M_s}{R_s^2} $$\nFor a *fluid* satellite, its internal structure affects its response to tidal forces. A more centrally condensed body (i.e., with a dense core) is more resistant to tidal disruption. We can model this by proposing that the effective self-gravitational force holding the satellite together is enhanced by a factor proportional to its degree of central condensation.
