The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, mathematically consistent, and all parameters and procedures are specified unambiguously. My approach will be to construct a numerical implementation of the described process.\n\nThe process for each test case involves three primary stages:\n1.  Synthesis of the time-domain signal (the light curve).\n2.  Application of a frequency-domain notch filter to suppress stellar pulsations.\n3.  Estimation of the transit depth from the filtered signal.\n\nThe analysis is performed on a uniformly sampled time series. The number of samples is $N = 4096$ and the sampling interval is $\\Delta t = 60 \\, \\mathrm{s}$. The discrete time points are $t_n = n \\Delta t$ for sample indices $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1 \\}$. The total duration of the observation, or baseline, is $T = N \\Delta t = 245760 \\, \\mathrm{s}$.\n\nFirst, the synthetic light curve, $\\ell_n$, is constructed based on the provided model:\n$$\n\\ell_n = 1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{K} A_k \\, \\sin\\!\\left(2\\pi \\,\\frac{m_k}{N} \\, n + \\phi_k \\right) - d \\, \\mathbf{1}_{\\mathrm{tr}}(n)\n$$\nThis model is comprised of three components:\n- A constant baseline flux, normalized to $1$.\n- A stellar variability signal, modeled as a sum of $K$ sinusoidal pulsations. Each pulsation $k$ is defined by its amplitude $A_k$, phase $\\phi_k$, and a frequency index $m_k$, which corresponds to a physical frequency of $\\nu_{m_k} = m_k / T$. The use of integer indices $m_k$ ensures that each pulsation is commensurate with the observation baseline $T$, meaning an integer number of cycles fit into the time series.\n- An exoplanet transit signal, $-d \\, \\mathbf{1}_{\\mathrm{tr}}(n)$. The function $\\mathbf{1}_{\\mathrm{tr}}(n)$ is a periodic indicator function representing the moments when the planet is transiting its star. It is equal to $1$ during transit and $0$ otherwise. The transit has a depth $d$, a period of $P_{\\text{steps}}$ samples, and a duration of $\\tau_{\\text{steps}}$ samples. This creates a periodic sequence of box-shaped dips in the light curve.\n\nSecond, a frequency-domain notch filter is applied to remove the stellar pulsation signals. This is achieved using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The light curve $\\{\\ell_n\\}$ is transformed into the frequency domain to obtain its spectrum $\\{L_m\\}$ via the DFT:\n$$\nL_m = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\ell_n \\, e^{-2\\pi i \\, n m / N}\n$$\nThe core principle of the filter is to identify the frequency bins corresponding to the known stellar pulsations and set their amplitudes to zero. For a real-valued signal like $\\{\\ell_n\\}$, its DFT exhibits Hermitian symmetry, i.e., $L_m = L_{(N-m) \\pmod N}^*$. To ensure that the filtered signal remains real-valued after the inverse transform, we must zero out coefficients symmetrically. For each pulsation index $m_k$, we must zero out the frequency components not only at $m_k$ but also at its corresponding negative frequency, which is represented by the index $(N-m_k) \\pmod N$ in the standard DFT output. The problem specifies a filter half-width $h$, which dictates that we zero out a small band of $2h+1$ frequency bins around each pulsation frequency and its conjugate. The set of indices to be zeroed, $\\mathcal{S}$, is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathcal{S} = \\bigcup_{k=1}^{K} \\left( \\{ (m_k + j) \\bmod N : j \\in \\{-h, \\dots, h\\} \\} \\cup \\{ ((N - m_k) + j) \\bmod N : j \\in \\{-h, \\dots, h\\} \\} \\right)\n$$\nA new, filtered spectrum $\\{L'_m\\}$ is created by setting $L'_m = 0$ for all $m \\in \\mathcal{S}$ and leaving other components unchanged ($L'_m = L_m$). The filtered time-domain signal $\\{\\ell'_n\\}$ is then recovered by applying the inverse DFT:\n$$\n\\ell'_n = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} L'_m \\, e^{2\\pi i \\, n m / N}\n$$\nThe resulting signal $\\{\\ell'_n\\}$ should be real-valued, although small imaginary components may arise from floating-point inaccuracies; these are discarded by taking the real part of the result.\n\nThird, the transit depth is estimated from the filtered light curve $\\{\\ell'_n\\}$. The depth is defined as the difference between the out-of-transit flux and the in-transit flux. To obtain a robust estimate, medians are used instead of means, as medians are less sensitive to outliers or residual artifacts from the filtering process. The estimated depth, $\\widehat{d}$, is calculated as:\n$$\n\\widehat{d} = \\mathrm{median}\\{ \\ell'_n : \\mathbf{1}_{\\mathrm{tr}}(n) = 0 \\} - \\mathrm{median}\\{ \\ell'_n : \\mathbf{1}_{\\mathrm{tr}}(n) = 1 \\}\n$$\nThis procedure is applied to each of the four test cases provided, and the resulting estimated depths are reported in the specified format.
