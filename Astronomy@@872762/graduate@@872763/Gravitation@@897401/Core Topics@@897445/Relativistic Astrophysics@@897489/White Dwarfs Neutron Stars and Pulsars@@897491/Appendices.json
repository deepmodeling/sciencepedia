This leads to a fascinating phase transition, as the ions arrange themselves into a solid crystal lattice, fundamentally changing the star's properties. In this exercise, you will apply the Lindemann criterion from condensed matter physics to the exotic environment of a white dwarf core to determine the conditions under which this crystallization occurs [@problem_id:926985].", "problem": "A white dwarf star is the remnant of a low-to-medium mass star. After it has exhausted its nuclear fuel, it cools down over billions of years. Its core is a dense plasma composed of ions (typically carbon or oxygen) and a degenerate gas of electrons. As the white dwarf cools, the electrostatic potential energy between the ions eventually dominates their thermal kinetic energy, causing the ions to arrange themselves into a regular crystal lattice. This process is known as crystallization.\n\nIn this problem, we will model the ionic component of the white dwarf core as a one-component plasma (OCP) of ions with charge $Ze$ and mass $M_i$, immersed in a uniform, neutralizing background of degenerate electrons. The crystallization of this plasma can be described by the Lindemann criterion, which posits that a solid melts when the root-mean-square amplitude of atomic vibrations, $\\sqrt{\\langle u^2 \\rangle}$, becomes a certain fraction, $\\delta$, of the mean inter-ionic separation, $a$. Conversely, the plasma crystallizes when this ratio drops below $\\delta$. The criterion is thus $\\langle u^2 \\rangle / a^2 = \\delta^2$. The parameter $\\delta$ is the Lindemann parameter, a dimensionless constant.\n\nAt extremely high densities, quantum effects become important. The ions, even at absolute zero temperature, possess zero-point energy which causes them to vibrate. If the density is high enough, these zero-point vibrations alone can be sufficient to \"melt\" the solid, a phenomenon known as quantum melting.\n\nWe model the ions in the lattice as independent 3D quantum harmonic oscillators with an angular frequency equal to the ion plasma frequency, $\\omega_p$. The mean-square displacement of an ion from its lattice site, including both thermal and quantum effects, is given by\n$$\n\\langle u^2 \\rangle = \\frac{3\\hbar}{2M_i\\omega_p} \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_p}{2k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature.

(Note: We are using Gaussian CGS units where the Coulomb potential is $V(r)=(Ze)^2/r$). The mean inter-ionic separation $a$ is the Wigner-Seitz radius, defined by the relation that the volume of a sphere of radius $a$ equals the volume per ion: $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^3 = 1/n_i$.\n\nDetermine the critical mass density $\\rho_{crit}$ of the white dwarf core at which quantum melting occurs at zero temperature ($T=0$).
