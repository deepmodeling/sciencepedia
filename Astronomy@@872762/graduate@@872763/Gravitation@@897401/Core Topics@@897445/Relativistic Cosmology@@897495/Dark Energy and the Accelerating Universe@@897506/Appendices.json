A key feature of this model is a \"screening mechanism\" that allows the field to have significant cosmological effects while remaining undetectable in high-density environments, such as our solar system, thereby satisfying local gravity tests.\n\nThe model is defined by the scalar field's potential and its coupling to matter. The bare potential for the symmetron field $\\phi$ exhibits a $Z_2$ symmetry ($\\phi \\to -\\phi$) and is given by:\n$$\nV(\\phi) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\mu^2\\phi^2 + \\frac{1}{4}\\lambda\\phi^4\n$$\nwhere $\\mu$ and $\\lambda$ are positive real parameters of the model.\n\nIn the presence of non-relativistic matter with mass density $\\rho_m$, the symmetron field couples to the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. This interaction can be described by an additional term in the effective potential for $\\phi$. For a standard choice of coupling, the effective potential becomes:\n$$\nV_{eff}(\\phi) = V(\\phi) + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\rho_m}{M^2} \\phi^2\n$$\nwhere $M$ is a parameter with units of mass that determines the strength of the coupling between the symmetron and matter.\n\nIn regions of high matter density, the effective potential has a single minimum at $\\phi=0$. The $Z_2$ symmetry is preserved, and the field has a large mass, which screens its effects. As the universe expands, $\\rho_m$ decreases. Below a certain critical density, $\\rho_c$, the minimum at $\\phi=0$ becomes unstable, and the potential develops new minima at non-zero values of $\\phi$. This constitutes a spontaneous symmetry-breaking phase transition.\n\n**Problem:**\n\nDetermine the critical matter density $\\rho_c$ at which the spontaneous symmetry-breaking phase transition occurs.
