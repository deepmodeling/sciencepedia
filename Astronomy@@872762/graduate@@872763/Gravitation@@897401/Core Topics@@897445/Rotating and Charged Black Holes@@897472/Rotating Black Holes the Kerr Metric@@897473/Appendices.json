In Boyer-Lindquist coordinates $(t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, with the speed of light $c$ and gravitational constant $G$, the line element $ds^2 = g_{\\mu\\nu}dx^\\mu dx^\\nu$ has several non-zero components. The presence of a non-zero off-diagonal component $g_{t\\phi}$ is a direct manifestation of the frame-dragging effect, where spacetime itself is 'dragged' along with the rotation of the black hole.
