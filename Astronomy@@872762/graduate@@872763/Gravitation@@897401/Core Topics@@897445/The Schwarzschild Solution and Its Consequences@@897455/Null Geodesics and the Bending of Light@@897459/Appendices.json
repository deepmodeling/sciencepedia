Derivation of the Dimensionless Orbital Equation and Unperturbed Solution**\n\nThe Binet equation for the trajectory of a massless particle (a null geodesic) in the Schwarzschild spacetime, expressed using the reciprocal radius $u(\\phi) = 1/r(\\phi)$, is given in geometric units ($G=c=1$) by:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2u}{d\\phi^2} + u = 3Mu^2\n$$\nwhere $M$ is the mass of the central body.\n\nWe introduce the dimensionless variables $\\bar{u}(\\phi) = b u(\\phi)$ and $\\mu = M/b$, where $b$ is the impact parameter. Substituting $u = \\bar{u}/b$ into the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{d\\phi^2}\\left(\\frac{\\bar{u}}{b}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{\\bar{u}}{b}\\right) = 3M\\left(\\frac{\\bar{u}}{b}\\right)^2\n$$\nMultiplying by $b$ yields the dimensionless orbital equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\bar{u}}{d\\phi^2} + \\bar{u} = \\frac{3M}{b}\\bar{u}^2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\bar{u}}{d\\phi^2} + \\bar{u} = 3\\mu \\bar{u}^2\n$$\nThis is the required equation for $\\bar{u}(\\phi)$.\n\nFor the unperturbed case, we set $\\mu=0$. The equation reduces to the simple harmonic oscillator equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\bar{u}_0}{d\\phi^2} + \\bar{u}_0 = 0\n$$\nThe general solution is $\\bar{u}_0(\\phi) = A\\cos(\\phi) + B\\sin(\\phi)$. The coordinate system for $\\phi$ is chosen such that the incoming path is from $\\phi \\approx 0$ and the outgoing path is towards $\\phi \\approx \\pi$. The problem states that the point of closest approach occurs at $\\phi = \\pi/2$. At closest approach, $r$ is a minimum, so $u=1/r$ and $\\bar{u}$ are maximum. This requires the derivative of $\\bar{u}_0$ to be zero at $\\phi=\\pi/2$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\bar{u}_0}{d\\phi}\\bigg|_{\\phi=\\pi/2} = [-A\\sin(\\phi) + B\\cos(\\phi)]_{\\phi=\\pi/2} = -A\\sin(\\pi/2) + B\\cos(\\pi/2) = -A = 0\n$$\nThus, $A=0$, and the solution is of the form $\\bar{u}_0(\\phi) = B\\sin(\\phi)$. For the unperturbed straight-line trajectory, the distance of closest approach is the impact parameter $b$. At $\\phi=\\pi/2$, we have $r=b$, which means $u=1/b$. In dimensionless terms, this is $\\bar{u}_0(\\pi/2) = b u(\\pi/2) = b(1/b) = 1$. Evaluating our solution at this point gives $\\bar{u}_0(\\pi/2) = B\\sin(\\pi/2)=B=1$.\nTherefore, the unperturbed solution is:\n$$\n\\bar{u}_0(\\phi) = \\sin(\\phi)\n$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the First-Order Perturbation Equation**\n\nWe introduce a first-order perturbation of the form $\\bar{u}(\\phi) = \\bar{u}_0(\\phi) + \\mu w(\\phi)$ into the full dimensionless equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{d\\phi^2}(\\bar{u}_0 + \\mu w) + (\\bar{u}_0 + \\mu w) = 3\\mu(\\bar{u}_0 + \\mu w)^2\n$$\nExpanding and grouping by powers of $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d^2\\bar{u}_0}{d\\phi^2} + \\bar{u}_0\\right) + \\mu\\left(\\frac{d^2w}{d\\phi^2} + w\\right) = 3\\mu(\\bar{u}_0^2 + 2\\mu\\bar{u}_0w + O(\\mu^2))\n$$\nThe first term on the left is zero since $\\bar{u}_0$ is the solution to the homogeneous equation. Equating terms of order $\\mu$ on both sides gives:\n$$\n\\mu\\left(\\frac{d^2w}{d\\phi^2} + w\\right) = 3\\mu\\bar{u}_0^2\n$$\nDividing by $\\mu$ and substituting $\\bar{u}_0(\\phi)=\\sin(\\phi)$, we obtain the linear inhomogeneous ordinary differential equation for the perturbation function $w(\\phi)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2w}{d\\phi^2}(\\phi) + w(\\phi) = 3\\sin^2(\\phi)\n$$\nThis ODE is of the form $w''(\\phi) + k(\\phi)w(\\phi) = s(\\phi)$, with $k(\\phi)=1$ and $s(\\phi)=3\\sin^2(\\phi)$.\n\nThe physical trajectory must be symmetric about the point of closest approach, $\\phi=\\pi/2$. Since the unperturbed solution $\\bar{u}_0(\\phi)=\\sin(\\phi)$ is symmetric about $\\phi=\\pi/2$ (as $\\sin(\\pi/2+\\delta) = \\sin(\\pi/2-\\delta)$), the perturbation $w(\\phi)$ must also be symmetric. This implies that its derivative must be zero at the point of symmetry:\n$$\n\\frac{dw}{d\\phi}\\bigg|_{\\phi=\\pi/2} = 0\n$$\nThis provides one boundary condition. To start a numerical integration, a second condition, the value of $w(\\pi/2)$, is needed. The general solution to the ODE for $w(\\phi)$ is $w(\\phi) = C\\sin(\\phi) + 2 - \\sin^2(\\phi)$. The condition $w'(\\pi/2)=0$ is satisfied for any choice of the constant $C$. The value at the midpoint is $w(\\pi/2) = C+1$. As will be shown in Task 4, the final bending angle is independent of $C$. For computational simplicity, we set $C=0$, which corresponds to the standard particular solution for this problem. This choice gives the second boundary condition:\n$$\nw(\\pi/2) = 1\n$$\n\n**3. Numerov Scheme Design**\n\nThe task is to solve the ODE $w''(\\phi) + k(\\phi)w(\\phi) = s(\\phi)$ where $k(\\phi)=1$ and $s(\\phi)=3\\sin^2(\\phi)$. The Numerov method is a sixth-order accurate scheme for this type of equation. On a uniform grid $\\phi_n = n h$, the recurrence relation is:\n$$\ny_{n+1}\\left(1+\\frac{h^2}{12}k_{n+1}\\right) = 2y_n\\left(1-\\frac{5h^2}{12}k_n\\right) - y_{n-1}\\left(1+\\frac{h^2}{12}k_{n-1}\\right) + \\frac{h^2}{12}(s_{n+1}+10s_n+s_{n-1})\n$$\nSince $k(\\phi)=1$ is constant, this simplifies for $w_n=w(\\phi_n)$ to:\n$$\nw_{n+1}\\left(1+\\frac{h^2}{12}\\right) = 2w_n\\left(1-\\frac{5h^2}{12}\\right) - w_{n-1}\\left(1+\\frac{h^2}{12}\\right) + \\frac{h^2}{12}(s_{n+1}+10s_n+s_{n-1})\n$$\nThe integration will start from the center point $\\phi_c = \\pi/2$. Let the grid index for this point be $i_c$. We need two initial values to start the recurrence. We use $w_{i_c} = w(\\pi/2)$ and a second value $w_{i_c-1} = w(\\pi/2 - h)$ derived from a Taylor expansion around $\\phi_c = \\pi/2$:\n$$\nw(\\phi_c-h) = w(\\phi_c) - h w'(\\phi_c) + \\frac{h^2}{2}w''(\\phi_c) - \\frac{h^3}{6}w'''(\\phi_c) + \\frac{h^4}{24}w^{(4)}(\\phi_c) + O(h^6)\n$$\nUsing our boundary conditions and the ODE:\n- $w(\\phi_c) = 1$\n- $w'(\\phi_c) = 0$\n- $w''(\\phi_c) = -w(\\phi_c) + s(\\phi_c) = -1 + 3\\sin^2(\\pi/2) = 2$\n- $w'''(\\phi) = -w'(\\phi) + 3\\sin(2\\phi) \\implies w'''(\\phi_c) = 0$\n- $w^{(4)}(\\phi) = -w''(\\phi) + 6\\cos(2\\phi) \\implies w^{(4)}(\\phi_c) = -2 + 6\\cos(\\pi) = -8$\n\nSubstituting these into the expansion:\n$$\nw(\\pi/2 - h) = 1 + h^2 - \\frac{h^4}{3}\n$$\nWith $w_{i_c}$ and $w_{i_c-1}$ known, we can march backwards towards $\\phi=0$ by rearranging the Numerov recurrence to solve for $w_{n-1}$:\n$$\nw_{n-1} = \\frac{1}{1+h^2/12}\\left[ 2w_n\\left(1-\\frac{5h^2}{12}\\right) - w_{n+1}\\left(1+\\frac{h^2}{12}\\right) + \\frac{h^2}{12}(s_{n+1}+10s_n+s_{n-1}) \\right]\n$$\nThis is applied iteratively for $n = i_c-1, i_c-2, ..., 1$. The solution for $\\phi \\in [\\pi/2, \\pi]$ is found by exploiting the symmetry: $w(\\pi/2+\\delta) = w(\\pi/2-\\delta)$, which means on the grid, $w_{i_c+k} = w_{i_c-k}$.\n\n**4. Bending Angle Estimation**\n\nThe total bending angle $\\alpha$ is the deviation of the total change in angle of the trajectory from the unperturbed value of $\\pi$ radians. The asymptotes of the trajectory occur where $r \\to \\infty$, which means $\\bar{u}(\\phi) = 0$. We seek the roots of $\\bar{u}(\\phi) = \\sin(\\phi) + \\mu w(\\phi) = 0$.\n\nFor the incoming asymptote, near $\\phi=0$, let the root be $\\phi_{in}$. For small $\\phi_{in}$, we linearize: $\\sin(\\phi_{in}) \\approx \\phi_{in}$ and $w(\\phi_{in}) \\approx w(0)$.\n$$\n\\phi_{in} + \\mu w(0) \\approx 0 \\implies \\phi_{in} \\approx -\\mu w(0)\n$$\nFor the outgoing asymptote, near $\\phi=\\pi$, let the root be $\\phi_{out} = \\pi + \\delta\\phi$. For small $\\delta\\phi$: $\\sin(\\pi+\\delta\\phi) \\approx -\\delta\\phi$ and $w(\\pi+\\delta\\phi) \\approx w(\\pi)$.\n$$\n-\\delta\\phi + \\mu w(\\pi) \\approx 0 \\implies \\delta\\phi \\approx \\mu w(\\pi)\n$$\nSo, $\\phi_{out} \\approx \\pi + \\mu w(\\pi)$. The total angle traversed is $\\Delta\\Phi = \\phi_{out} - \\phi_{in} \\approx (\\pi + \\mu w(\\pi)) - (-\\mu w(0)) = \\pi + \\mu(w(0)+w(\\pi))$.\nThe bending angle $\\alpha$ is the deviation from $\\pi$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\Delta\\Phi - \\pi = \\mu(w(0) + w(\\pi))\n$$\nFrom symmetry, $w(0) = w(\\pi)$. Thus, the final formula for the bending angle using the numerically computed $w(\\phi)$ is:\n$$\n\\alpha = 2\\mu w(0)\n$$\nThe analytical solution $w(\\phi) = 2-\\sin^2(\\phi)$ gives $w(0)=2$, which recovers the known GR result $\\alpha = 4\\mu = 4M/b$. Our numerical procedure should approximate this result. For the test case $\\mu=0$, the formula correctly gives $\\alpha=0$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_bending_angle(mu, N=2**16):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the weak-field gravitational bending angle of light.\n\n    This function implements a Numerov scheme to solve the first-order\n    perturbation equation for a null geodesic in Schwarzschild spacetime.\n\n    Args:\n        mu (float): The dimensionless mass-to-impact-parameter ratio M/b.\n        N (int): The number of grid intervals for the phi-domain [0, pi].\n                 Must be an even number.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The total bending angle alpha in radians.\n    \"\"\"\n    if mu == 0.0:\n        return 0.0\n\n    # 1.
