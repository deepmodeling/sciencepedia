{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Before delving into the quantum aspects of the information paradox, it is crucial to understand its classical predecessor: the \"no-hair theorem\". This principle of general relativity posits that a stationary black hole is completely characterized by just three external properties: its mass $M$, electric charge $Q$, and angular momentum $J$, erasing all other details of the matter that formed it. The following thought experiment [@problem_id:1815935] challenges you to apply this theorem to a concrete scenario, forcing a confrontation with the profound implications of classical information loss at an event horizon.", "problem": "Two isolated, stationary black holes, designated BH-1 and BH-2, are discovered in intergalactic space. After careful observation, astronomers determine that both black holes have the exact same mass $M$, the same electric charge $Q$, and the same angular momentum $J$. However, historical astronomical data reveals that their origins are vastly different. BH-1 formed from the gravitational collapse of a massive star composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. BH-2 formed from the collapse of a rogue, planet-sized artifact of artificial origin, which was composed of a complex mixture of heavy elements, including a significant amount of materials with a high baryon number per unit mass compared to the star.\n\nA debate arises among the astronomers. One young researcher proposes that even though the mass, charge, and spin are identical, a sufficiently sensitive detector could distinguish between BH-1 and BH-2. They argue that the different initial compositions, specifically the vastly different total baryon number locked within them, must give rise to a subtle, unique, long-range field that could be measured externally.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately evaluates the researcher's proposal based on the established principles of classical General Relativity?\n\nA. The researcher is correct. The fundamental conservation of baryon number implies that the different initial compositions will manifest as a measurable external \"baryonic field,\" allowing the two black holes to be distinguished.\n\nB. The researcher is incorrect. All information about the specific composition (such as baryon number or the type of matter) of the material that formed the black holes is lost to external observers, and the black holes are completely indistinguishable from the outside.\n\nC. The researcher is partially correct. While a static field may not be present, the difference in internal composition will cause the black holes to emit different spectra of Hawking radiation, allowing them to be distinguished over extremely long timescales.\n\nD. The researcher is incorrect, but not because the information is lost. The information about baryon number is conserved within the event horizon, but the principles of causality in General Relativity prevent any of that information from being communicated to the outside universe.\n\nE. The researcher is correct. Although a classical field is not generated, the information about the complex internal structure is encoded holographically on the surface of the event horizon and could be retrieved and decoded with sufficiently advanced technology.", "solution": "We apply the classical black hole uniqueness (no-hair) theorems in Einstein-Maxwell theory. For stationary, asymptotically flat, non-degenerate black holes governed by the Einstein-Maxwell equations, the exterior spacetime is uniquely described by the Kerr-Newman family and is fully characterized by three parameters: the ADM mass $M$, the total electric charge $Q$, and the total angular momentum $J$. No additional independent classical charges associated with the matter’s microscopic composition exist in the exterior solution.\n\nConcretely, the exterior geometry and electromagnetic field of a stationary black hole in this setting are Kerr-Newman and are fixed by $(M,Q,J)$. A precise diagnostic of this uniqueness is given by the Geroch-Hansen multipole moments: for the Kerr solution (and analogously for Kerr-Newman including electromagnetic moments), the mass and current multipoles satisfy\n$$\nM_{\\ell}+i S_{\\ell}=M (i a)^{\\ell}, \\quad a=\\frac{J}{M},\n$$\nand the electromagnetic multipoles obey\n$$\nQ_{\\ell}+i P_{\\ell}=Q (i a)^{\\ell}.\n$$\nAll higher multipoles are functions of $M$, $Q$, and $a=J/M$, so there is no freedom left to imprint the progenitor’s composition (e.g., baryon number) on the external fields. Thus, any measurement of the exterior gravitational and electromagnetic fields can only recover $M$, $Q$, and $J$.\n\nNext, consider whether baryon number could generate an additional classical long-range field. In classical general relativity coupled to standard electromagnetism, only charges associated with massless gauge fields produce long-range inverse-square fields constrained by Gauss-type laws. Maxwell’s equation $\\nabla_{\\mu} F^{\\mu\\nu}=J^{\\nu}$ implies that the flux of $F$ at spatial infinity equals the total electric charge $Q$, while the ADM definitions fix $M$ and $J$ for gravity. Baryon number in the Standard Model is (at best) a global $U(1)$, not a gauged symmetry, so it does not source a classical long-range field; there is no corresponding Gauss law at infinity for baryon number. Therefore, no external “baryonic field” can exist in the classical theory to distinguish the two black holes.\n\nRegarding Hawking radiation, that effect lies beyond classical general relativity (it is semiclassical quantum field theory on curved spacetime). Even when included at leading order, the emission spectrum depends only on horizon properties determined by $(M,Q,J)$, specifically the surface gravity $\\kappa$, the horizon angular velocity $\\Omega_{H}$, and the horizon electric potential $\\Phi_{H}$. For Kerr-Newman,\n$$\nr_{\\pm}=M \\pm \\sqrt{M^{2}-a^{2}-Q^{2}}, \\quad a=\\frac{J}{M},\n$$\n$$\n\\kappa=\\frac{r_{+}-r_{-}}{2\\left(r_{+}^{2}+a^{2}\\right)}, \\quad \\Omega_{H}=\\frac{a}{r_{+}^{2}+a^{2}}, \\quad \\Phi_{H}=\\frac{Q r_{+}}{r_{+}^{2}+a^{2}}.\n$$\nThese quantities, and thus the spectrum, depend only on $M$, $Q$, and $J$, not on progenitor composition. Therefore, even this quantum effect does not provide a composition-dependent signature in standard theory, and it is outside the scope of classical general relativity anyway.\n\nFinally, on the status of information: in classical GR, once an event horizon forms, exterior observers cannot obtain any information from behind the horizon due to causal structure. The exterior metric uniquely relaxes to Kerr-Newman, erasing any exterior imprint of the initial composition. From the standpoint of exterior physics, two black holes with the same $(M,Q,J)$ are completely indistinguishable. Assertions about holographic encoding or quantum information recovery are not part of classical GR and do not imply a measurable classical field.\n\nTherefore, based on classical GR and the no-hair theorems, the two black holes are indistinguishable to any exterior measurement beyond $(M,Q,J)$, and no classical “baryonic field” exists to differentiate them. This directly supports option B and rules out A, C, D, and E for the stated classical framework.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1815935"}, {"introduction": "The paradox truly ignites when we introduce quantum mechanics, leading to Hawking radiation and the concept of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.

A simplified toy model for this duality, particularly for understanding the black hole information paradox, is provided by quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs). In this model, the Hilbert space of a logical qubit in the bulk is encoded into a subspace of the Hilbert space of several physical qubits on the boundary. The process of Hawking radiation can be modeled as losing access to a subset of these physical boundary qubits.\n\nConsider the $[[5,1,3]]$ perfect quantum code, which encodes one logical qubit into five physical qubits. The code space is defined as the simultaneous $+1$ eigenspace of the four commuting stabilizer generators:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nS_1 &= X \\otimes Z \\otimes Z \\otimes X \\otimes I \\\\\nS_2 &= I \\otimes X \\otimes Z \\otimes Z \\otimes X \\\\\nS_3 &= X \\otimes I \\otimes X \\otimes Z \\otimes Z \\\\\nS_4 &= Z \\otimes X \\otimes I \\otimes X \\otimes Z\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nwhere $X, Y, Z$ are the Pauli matrices and $I$ is the identity matrix.\n\nSuppose an arbitrary logical pure state $|\\psi\\rangle_L = \\alpha|0\\rangle_L + \\beta|1\\rangle_L$ is prepared. Then, two of the five physical qubits are chosen uniformly at random and traced out, representing the information lost to Hawking radiation. An observer has access to the remaining three physical qubits and attempts to reconstruct the original logical state $|\\psi\\rangle_L$ by applying an optimal recovery procedure.\n\nCalculate the average fidelity between the initial and recovered logical states. The average is to be taken over all possible pure logical states $|\\psi\\rangle_L$ (i.e., over the entire Bloch sphere) and over all possible choices of the two traced-out qubits.", "solution": "Let the initial state of the logical qubit be a pure state $|\\psi\\rangle_L$, which lives in the two-dimensional code subspace $\\mathcal{C}$ of the full five-qubit Hilbert space $(\\mathbb{C}^2)^{\\otimes 5}$. The initial density matrix is $\\rho_L = |\\psi\\rangle_L \\langle\\psi|_L$.\n\nThe process involves randomly selecting a set $A$ of two physical qubits out of five and tracing them out. There are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ such sets. Let $\\bar{A}$ be the set of the remaining three qubits. The state of the remaining system is $\\rho_{\\bar{A}} = \\text{Tr}_A(\\rho_L)$.\n\nAn optimal recovery procedure is a quantum channel $R: \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_{\\bar{A}}) \\to \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_L)$ that maximizes the fidelity between the recovered state $\\rho_{rec} = R(\\rho_{\\bar{A}})$ and the original state $\\rho_L$. The fidelity is given by $F = \\langle\\psi|_L \\rho_{rec} |\\psi\\rangle_L$. We are interested in the average fidelity $\\bar{F}$, averaged over all initial pure states $|\\psi\\rangle_L$ and all 10 choices of the set $A$.\n\nThe possibility of perfect recovery ($F=1$ for all $|\\psi\\rangle_L$) depends on whether the information loss channel, $\\mathcal{N}_A(\\rho_L) = \\text{Tr}_A(\\rho_L)$, is reversible on the code space $\\mathcal{C}$. A quantum channel corresponding to the erasure of qubits in a set $A$ is correctable if and only if for any operator $O_A$ with support solely on the qubits in $A$, its projection onto the code space is proportional to the identity projector $P_{\\mathcal{C}}$. That is, for any $O_A$,\n$$P_{\\mathcal{C}} O_A P_{\\mathcal{C}} = c(O_A) P_{\\mathcal{C}}$$\nfor some constant $c(O_A)$. If this condition holds, perfect recovery is possible, and the fidelity is 1.\n\nWe need to check this condition for the $[[5,1,3]]$ code where the erased set $A$ consists of two qubits. Let's analyze the condition for an arbitrary Pauli operator $O_A$ supported on $A$. If $O_A$ anticommutes with any stabilizer generator $S_k$, i.e., $\\{O_A, S_k\\} = 0$, then for any state $|\\phi\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{C}$, we have $S_k|\\phi\\rangle = |\\phi\\rangle$. Then,\n$$S_k (O_A |\\phi\\rangle) = -O_A S_k |\\phi\\rangle = -O_A |\\phi\\rangle$$\nThis means $O_A|\\phi\\rangle$ is in the $-1$ eigenspace of $S_k$ and is therefore orthogonal to the code space $\\mathcal{C}$. Thus, for any $|\\psi\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{C}$, $\\langle\\psi| O_A |\\phi\\rangle = 0$. This implies $P_{\\mathcal{C}} O_A P_{\\mathcal{C}} = 0$. The condition is satisfied with $c(O_A)=0$.\n\nIf $O_A$ commutes with all stabilizer generators, it belongs to the normalizer of the stabilizer group, $\\mathcal{N(S)}$. The normalizer consists of the stabilizers $\\mathcal{S}$ themselves and the logical operators.\n$$O_A \\in \\mathcal{N(S)} = \\mathcal{S} \\cup \\{ \\text{logical operators} \\}$$\n- If $O_A \\in \\mathcal{S}$, then $O_A|\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle$ for all $|\\psi\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{C}$. So $P_{\\mathcal{C}} O_A P_{\\mathcal{C}} = P_{\\mathcal{C}}$ and the condition holds with $c(O_A)=1$.\n- If $O_A$ is a logical operator, it does not act as a multiple of the identity on the code space, and the condition $P_{\\mathcal{C}} O_A P_{\\mathcal{C}} = cP_{\\mathcal{C}}$ is violated. This would make the erasure uncorrectable.\n\nSo, perfect recovery is possible if and only if no operator supported on the erased set $A$ is a logical operator, and any operator on $A$ that is not a stabilizer must anticommute with at least one stabilizer.\n\nLet's examine the properties of the $[[5,1,3]]$ code.\n1.  **Logical operators:** The distance of the code is $d=3$. This means the minimum weight (number of non-identity Pauli matrices) of a logical operator is 3. An operator $O_A$ supported on two qubits has a weight of at most 2. Therefore, $O_A$ cannot be a logical operator.\n\n2.  **Stabilizer operators:** The specified generators $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$ all have weight 4. Let's check the weight of their products.\n    $S_1 S_2 = (X_1 Z_2 Z_3 X_4 I_5)(I_1 X_2 Z_3 Z_4 X_5) = X_1 (Z_2X_2) (Z_3Z_3) (X_4Z_4) (I_5 X_5) = X_1(iY_2)I_3(-iY_4)X_5 = Y_2Y_4X_1X_5$. The weight is 4.\n    By symmetry of the stabilizer generators under relabeling and Pauli transformations, one can show that any non-trivial element of the stabilizer group $\\mathcal{S}$ for this code has weight at least 3. In fact, all 15 non-trivial stabilizers have weight 4. An operator $O_A$ with support on two qubits (weight $\\le 2$) cannot be a stabilizer.\n\nCombining these points: any Pauli operator $O_A$ with support on a set $A$ of two qubits is neither a logical operator nor a stabilizer. Therefore, it cannot be in the normalizer of the stabilizer group. This implies that $O_A$ must anticommute with at least one stabilizer generator $S_k$.\n\nAs shown above, if $O_A$ anticommutes with some $S_k$, then $P_{\\mathcal{C}} O_A P_{\\mathcal{C}} = 0$. This holds for any Pauli operator supported on any set $A$ of two qubits. Since any operator $O_A$ can be written as a linear combination of Pauli operators, the condition holds for all operators on $A$.\n\nThis means that for any choice of two erased qubits, the erasure is correctable. An optimal recovery procedure can restore the original logical state $|\\psi\\rangle_L$ perfectly. Thus, for any set $A$ of two erased qubits, the fidelity is 1, regardless of the initial state.\n\nThe average fidelity is an average over the $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ choices for the pair of traced-out qubits. Since the fidelity is 1 for each choice, the average fidelity is also 1.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\nLet $F_A(\\psi)$ be the fidelity for a given choice of erased qubits $A$ and initial state $\\psi$. Let $\\bar{F}_A = \\int d\\psi F_A(\\psi)$ be the state-averaged fidelity for a fixed $A$. Let $\\bar{F}_{total}$ be the total average fidelity.\nWe have shown that for any $A$ with $|A|=2$, perfect recovery is possible, so $F_A(\\psi)=1$ for all $\\psi$. Therefore, $\\bar{F}_A = 1$ for all $A$.\n$$ \\bar{F}_{total} = \\frac{1}{\\binom{5}{2}} \\sum_{A:|A|=2} \\bar{F}_A = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{i=1}^{10} 1 = \\frac{10}{10} = 1 $$\nThe average fidelity of the logical state is 1.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1} $$", "id": "145163"}]}
