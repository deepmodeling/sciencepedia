[@problem_id:875920]", "problem": "**Problem Statement**\n\nIn the study of gravitational collapse, phenomena of criticality have been observed, analogous to critical phase transitions in statistical mechanics. Consider the spherically symmetric collapse of a massless scalar field governed by the Einstein field equations. The initial data for the scalar field is specified by a one-parameter family, characterized by an amplitude-like parameter $p$. There exists a critical value $p^*$ such that for $p > p^*$ the collapse leads to a black hole, while for $p < p^*$ the field disperses to infinity.\n\nFor near-critical initial data, i.e., where $p$ is infinitesimally close to $p^*$, the mass of the formed black hole, $M_{\\text{BH}}$, is found to obey a universal power-law scaling relation:\n$$M_{\\text{BH}} = C |p - p^*|^\\gamma$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant and $\\gamma$ is a universal mass-scaling exponent that is independent of the specific details of the initial data family, but dependent on the matter model.\n\nThe dynamics at the threshold of black hole formation ($p=p^*$) is described by a specific *critical solution*. This solution is discretely self-similar (DSS). A key feature of DSS is that the solution's profile repeats itself on ever-decreasing time and length scales. This can be captured by using a logarithmic time coordinate, $\\tau = -\\ln(-t)$, where $t$ is the proper time of a central observer approaching the central singularity at $t=0$. In this logarithmic time, the critical solution is periodic.\n\nThe fate of a near-critical solution ($p \\approx p^*$) is determined by its deviation from the critical solution. Linear perturbation analysis of the critical solution reveals the existence of a single unstable (growing) mode. The amplitude of this mode, let's denote it by $\\Lambda(\\tau)$, determines whether the solution ultimately forms a black hole or disperses.\n\nYou are given the following properties of this system:\n1.  The initial amplitude of the unstable mode at some initial time $\\tau_0$ is directly proportional to the deviation of the initial data parameter $p$ from its critical value $p^*$. That is, $\\Lambda(\\tau_0) \\propto (p - p^*)$.\n2.  Due to the periodicity of the underlying critical solution, the evolution of the growing mode amplitude is governed by Floquet theory.
