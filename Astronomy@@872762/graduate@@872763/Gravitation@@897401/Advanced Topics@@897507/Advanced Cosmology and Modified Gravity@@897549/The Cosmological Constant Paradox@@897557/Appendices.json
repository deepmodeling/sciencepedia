{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The presence of a positive cosmological constant profoundly alters the nature of the quantum vacuum. In a de Sitter universe, characterized by a constant Hubble parameter $H$, an observer experiences the vacuum as a thermal bath with the Gibbons-Hawking temperature $T_{GH} = H/(2\\pi)$. This exercise provides a concrete calculation demonstrating this phenomenon by asking you to compute the decay rate of a massive particle, a process enhanced by the thermal properties of the de Sitter spacetime [@problem_id:913539]. This practice illuminates how the cosmological constant is deeply intertwined with quantum field theory.", "problem": "Consider a model in a 4-dimensional de Sitter (dS) spacetime described by a constant Hubble parameter $H$. The model consists of a massive real scalar field $\\Phi$ with mass $M$ and a massless, conformally coupled real scalar field $\\phi$. The interaction between these fields is described by the interaction Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{int}} = -\\frac{g}{2} \\Phi \\phi^2$, where $g$ is the coupling constant.\n\nIn Minkowski spacetime, the decay of a $\\Phi$ particle at rest into two $\\phi$ particles is a well-defined process with a decay rate $\\Gamma_0 = \\frac{g^2}{8\\pi M}$.\n\nIn dS spacetime, the Bunch-Davies vacuum state exhibits thermal properties. For a minimally coupled detector, it behaves as a thermal bath with the Gibbons-Hawking temperature $T_{GH} = \\frac{H}{2\\pi}$ (in natural units where $\\hbar=c=k_B=1$). The presence of this thermal bath modifies particle interaction rates due to quantum statistical effects. For a decay process of a boson $A$ into two identical bosons $B$ ($A \\to B+B$), the decay rate $\\Gamma$ in a thermal bath is related to the vacuum decay rate $d\\Gamma_0$ by\n$$\nd\\Gamma = d\\Gamma_0 (1+n(E_1))(1+n(E_2))\n$$\nwhere $E_1$ and $E_2$ are the energies of the final-state particles, and $n(E) = (e^{E/T} - 1)^{-1}$ is the Bose-Einstein distribution function at the bath temperature $T$. A more detailed analysis from thermal field theory shows that the physically relevant decay rate is given by summing over the probabilities of spontaneous and stimulated emission, leading to a modification factor of $(1 + n(E_1) + n(E_2))$.\n\nAssume that the kinematics of the decay of the $\\Phi$ particle at rest are approximately governed by local energy conservation. This implies that in the rest frame of the $\\Phi$ particle, the two created massless $\\phi$ particles are emitted back-to-back, each carrying an energy equal to half the mass of the parent particle.\n\nUsing this thermal analogy for de Sitter space, calculate the total decay rate $\\Gamma$ of the massive scalar particle $\\Phi$ at rest.
