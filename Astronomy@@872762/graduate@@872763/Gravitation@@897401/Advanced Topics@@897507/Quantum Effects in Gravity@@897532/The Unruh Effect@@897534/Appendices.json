This thought experiment confronts this apparent paradox head-on, forcing a careful distinction between a local principle and the global spacetime structure required for the Unruh effect [@problem_id:1877846]. Resolving this will clarify the fundamental conditions under which an observer perceives a thermal vacuum, highlighting the crucial role of causal horizons.", "problem": "The Unruh effect predicts that an observer undergoing uniform proper acceleration $a$ through empty Minkowski (flat) spacetime will perceive a thermal bath of particles, as if immersed in a black-body radiator at a temperature $T_U$ given by the Unruh temperature formula:\n$$T_U = \\frac{\\hbar a}{2 \\pi c k_B}$$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nNow, consider two scenarios.\nScenario 1: An astronaut is in a rocket in deep space, far from any significant gravitational sources, accelerating uniformly with a constant proper acceleration $a_0$. According to the Unruh effect, the astronaut's instruments would detect a temperature $T_0 = \\frac{\\hbar a_0}{2 \\pi c k_B}$.\n\nScenario 2: A physicist is stationary in a laboratory on the surface of a large, non-rotating planet. The magnitude of the local gravitational acceleration at the laboratory's location is $g = a_0$.\n\nAccording to Einstein's equivalence principle, the local physical effects of being in a uniform gravitational field are indistinguishable from being in a uniformly accelerating reference frame. A naive application of this principle suggests that the physicist on the planet should also detect a thermal bath at temperature $T_0$. However, it is an established fact that observers stationary in a gravitational field do not \"burn up\" or detect such a thermal background. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate physical resolution to this apparent paradox?\n\nA. The equivalence principle is fundamentally incompatible with quantum field theory and does not apply to quantum phenomena like the Unruh effect.\n\nB. The thermal radiation is only generated for observers accelerating with respect to a black hole's event horizon. The physicist on the planet is stationary relative to the planet itself, so no radiation is detected.\n\nC. The Unruh effect is a global phenomenon tied to the existence of an event horizon (a Rindler horizon) in the accelerating observer's reference frame in flat spacetime. The spacetime around the planet has a different global structure and lacks an equivalent horizon for a stationary observer.\n\nD. The physicist on the planet is in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding environment. Any perceived Unruh radiation is radiated away at an equal rate, resulting in a net measurement of zero temperature.\n\nE. The intense gravitational field of the planet causes a gravitational redshift that shifts the energy of all Unruh effect photons to zero, rendering them undetectable.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the Unruh temperature associated with a uniformly accelerated observer with proper acceleration $a$ in Minkowski spacetime:\n$$\nT_{U}=\\frac{\\hbar a}{2 \\pi c k_{B}}.\n$$\nThis arises because the Minkowski vacuum, when restricted to the Rindler wedge accessible to the accelerated observer, becomes a thermal state. Concretely, the Wightman function $G^{+}(\\tau)$ along a uniformly accelerated worldline satisfies the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition\n$$\nG^{+}(\\tau)=G^{+}(\\tau+i\\beta),\n$$\nwith inverse temperature $\\beta=\\frac{\\hbar}{k_{B}T}$ corresponding to $\\beta=\\frac{2 \\pi c}{a}$; equivalently $T=\\frac{\\hbar a}{2 \\pi c k_{B}}$. The thermality is a consequence of tracing over field modes beyond the Rindler horizon, a causal boundary that renders part of spacetime inaccessible to the accelerated observer.\n\nNext, we invoke the equivalence principle in its precise form: locally (i.e., in a sufficiently small neighborhood of an event), a uniformly accelerated frame in flat spacetime is indistinguishable from a frame at rest in a uniform gravitational field. This is a local statement about the equivalence of free-fall frames and the behavior of nongravitational physics in infinitesimal regions. It does not assert the equivalence of global causal structures of spacetimes or of the field-theoretic vacuum state as seen by noninertial observers over extended regions.\n\nIn the laboratory scenario on the surface of a large, non-rotating planet with local gravitational acceleration $g=a_{0}$, the observer is stationary in a static, asymptotically flat spacetime with a timelike Killing vector field $\\partial_{t}$ that remains timelike everywhere outside the matter distribution and does not vanish. There is no event horizon associated with this static region; equivalently, there is no Killing horizon where $g_{tt}$ vanishes. In the natural static vacuum (analogous to the Boulware vacuum for a star), the response of a stationary Unruh-DeWitt detector at rest in this spacetime need not be thermal; absent a horizon, there is no tracing over inaccessible modes enforced by global causality, and the vacuum need not appear thermal to stationary observers. Thus, no universal Unruh temperature $T_{0}=\\frac{\\hbar a_{0}}{2 \\pi c k_{B}}$ is detected by such an observer merely due to being stationary in the planet’s gravitational field.\n\nBy contrast, thermality for stationary or accelerating observers is indeed tied to the existence of horizons: for uniformly accelerated motion in Minkowski space (Rindler horizon), for static observers outside a black hole in appropriate quantum states (Hawking radiation from an event horizon), or for observers in de Sitter space (cosmological horizon). In these cases, the global structure includes a horizon, and the field state restricted to the accessible region satisfies a KMS condition with a nonzero temperature. In a generic static stellar spacetime without horizons, no such global mechanism exists.\n\nThis analysis resolves the apparent paradox: the equivalence principle remains valid as a local statement, but the Unruh effect depends on global causal structure and the presence of a horizon. Therefore, the most accurate choice is that the Unruh effect’s thermality is a global phenomenon tied to horizons, which a stationary observer on a planet does not encounter.\n\nHence the correct option is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1877846"}, {"introduction": "We now move from applying the Unruh temperature formula to deriving its thermal character from first principles.
