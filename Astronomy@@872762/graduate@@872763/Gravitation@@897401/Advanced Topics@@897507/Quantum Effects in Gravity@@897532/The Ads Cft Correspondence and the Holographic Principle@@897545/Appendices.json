This implies that the discriminant of the quadratic equation must be non-negative:\n$$\nd^2 + 4m^2L^2 \\ge 0\n$$\nThis condition is known as the Breitenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound. Stability is marginal at the point where this inequality is saturated, i.e., when the two exponents $\\Delta_+$ and $\\Delta_-$ become degenerate.

Thus, $m^2L^2 = -d^2/4$ is the critical value for marginal stability.\n\nThe second requirement of finite asymptotic energy concerns the normalizability of the field modes. The general solution for the scalar field near the boundary $z \\to 0$ has the form $\\phi(z,x) \\approx \\phi_-(x) z^{\\Delta_-} + \\phi_+(x) z^{\\Delta_+}$. In the AdS/CFT correspondence, a bulk scalar field $\\phi$ is dual to a scalar operator $\\mathcal{O}$ in the boundary CFT. The scaling dimension of this operator, denoted $\\Delta_{CFT}$, is related to the exponents $\\Delta_\\pm$.\n\nThe two falloffs, $z^{\\Delta_-}$ and $z^{\\Delta_+}$, play distinct roles. Since $\\sqrt{d^2 + 4m^2L^2} > 0$ for $m^2L^2 > -d^2/4$, we have $\\Delta_+ > \\Delta_-$. The slower falloff, associated with $\\Delta_-$, is the \"non-normalizable\" mode, while the faster falloff, associated with $\\Delta_+$, is the \"normalizable\" mode.\nIn the standard quantization scheme, the coefficient of the non-normalizable mode is interpreted as the source for the dual operator, $\\phi_-(x) \\propto J_\\mathcal{O}(x)$, while the coefficient of the normalizable mode corresponds to the expectation value of the operator, $\\phi_+(x) \\propto \\langle\\mathcal{O}(x)\\rangle$. The scaling dimension of the operator $\\mathcal{O}$ is given by the exponent of the normalizable mode:\n$$\n\\Delta_{CFT} = \\Delta_+ = \\frac{d}{2} + \\sqrt{\\frac{d^2}{4} + m^2L^2}\n$$\nHowever, for a certain range of masses above the BF bound, both modes are sufficiently well-behaved to define a unitary CFT, allowing for an \"alternate quantization\". The condition for alternate quantization is that the dimension $\\Delta_-$ respects the CFT unitarity bound for a scalar operator, which is $\\Delta_{CFT} \\ge (d-2)/2$. Requiring $\\Delta_- \\ge (d-2)/2$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{2} - \\sqrt{\\frac{d^2}{4} + m^2L^2} \\ge \\frac{d-2}{2}\n$$\n$$\n1 \\ge \\sqrt{\\frac{d^2}{4} + m^2L^2}\n$$\nSquaring both sides gives $1 \\ge \\frac{d^2}{4} + m^2L^2$, which implies $m^2L^2 \\le 1 - d^2/4$. Therefore, for masses in the range\n$$\n-\\frac{d^2}{4}  m^2L^2  1 - \\frac{d^2}{4}\n$$\nit is possible to choose the operator dimension to be $\\Delta_{CFT} = \\Delta_-$. In this scheme, the roles of source and expectation value are exchanged. The critical value $m^2L^2 = -d^2/4$ is the lower boundary of this window. At this specific point, $\\Delta_+ = \\Delta_- = d/2$, the two possible quantizations coincide, and there is only one possible scaling dimension for the dual operator, $\\Delta_{CFT}=d/2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{d^{2}}{4}}$$", "id": "2994597"}, {"introduction": "At the heart of the AdS/CFT correspondence lies a precise dictionary that translates calculations in the bulk gravitational theory into properties of the boundary quantum field theory.
