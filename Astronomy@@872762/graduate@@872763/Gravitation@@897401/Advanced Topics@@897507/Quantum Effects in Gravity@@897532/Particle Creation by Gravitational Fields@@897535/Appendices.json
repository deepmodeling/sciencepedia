For an irrotational, inviscid, barotropic fluid, the propagation of sound waves (phonons) can be described by an effective spacetime metric, known as the acoustic metric. A sonic horizon, analogous to a black hole's event horizon, can form where the fluid's velocity exceeds the local speed of sound.\n\nThe effective Hawking temperature $T_H$ of such a sonic horizon is related to its surface gravity $\\kappa$ by the formula $T_H = \\frac{\\hbar\\kappa}{2\\pi k_B}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.
