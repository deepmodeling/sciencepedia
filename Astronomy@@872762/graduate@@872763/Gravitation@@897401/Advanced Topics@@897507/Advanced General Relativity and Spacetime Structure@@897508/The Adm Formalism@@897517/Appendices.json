Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires the determination of the extrinsic curvature tensor, $K_{ab}$, of a spatial hypersurface $\\Sigma_t$ embedded in Minkowski spacetime $\\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$. We will begin by identifying the geometric quantities from the given information and then apply the fundamental definition of extrinsic curvature.\n\nThe spacetime manifold is described by coordinates $x^\\mu = (t, x^1, x^2, x^3)$, where Greek indices $\\mu, \\nu, \\dots$ range from $0$ to $3$, and Latin indices $a, b, \\dots$ range from $1$ to $3$. The metric tensor is given by $g_{\\mu\\nu} = \\mathrm{diag}(-1, 1, 1, 1)$. The hypersurfaces $\\Sigma_t$ are level sets of the time coordinate function $t$.\n\nFirst, we identify the future-pointing unit normal vector field $n$ to the hypersurfaces $\\Sigma_t$. In the $3+1$ (ADM) formalism, the time evolution vector field, which is the coordinate basis vector $\\partial_t = \\partial/\\partial t$, is decomposed into components normal and tangential to the hypersurface:\n$$\n(\\partial_t)^\\mu = N n^\\mu + \\beta^\\mu\n$$\nHere, $N$ is the lapse function, $n^\\mu$ is the future-pointing unit normal vector field ($g_{\\mu\\nu}n^\\mu n^\\nu = -1$), and $\\beta^\\mu$ is the shift vector, which is tangent to $\\Sigma_t$. The problem provides $N=1$ and the shift vector components $\\beta^a=0$, which implies the shift vector itself is zero, $\\beta^\\mu = 0$. Substituting these values into the decomposition gives:\n$$\n(\\partial_t)^\\mu = (1) n^\\mu + 0 = n^\\mu\n$$\nThus, the future-pointing unit normal vector field is identical to the coordinate basis vector field $\\partial_t$. In component form, $n^\\mu = (1, 0, 0, 0)$.\n\nThe fundamental definition of the extrinsic curvature tensor $K$ relates it to the covariant derivative of the normal vector field. Specifically, for any two vector fields $X$ and $Y$ tangent to the hypersurface $\\Sigma_t$, the extrinsic curvature is given by:\n$$\nK(X, Y) = g(\\nabla_X n, Y)\n$$\nWe choose the coordinate basis vectors on the hypersurface, $E_a = \\partial_a = \\partial/\\partial x^a$ for $a \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, as the basis for the tangent space of $\\Sigma_t$. The components of the extrinsic curvature tensor in this basis are then:\n$$\nK_{ab} = K(\\partial_a, \\partial_b) = g(\\nabla_{\\partial_a} n, \\partial_b)\n$$\nSubstituting $n = \\partial_t$, we need to compute $K_{ab} = g(\\nabla_{\\partial_a} \\partial_t, \\partial_b)$. The term $\\nabla_{\\partial_a} \\partial_t$ is the covariant derivative of the vector field $\\partial_t$ along the direction of the vector field $\\partial_a$. Its components are given by the formula involving Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\mu\\nu}$:\n$$\n(\\nabla_{\\partial_a} \\partial_t)^\\lambda = (\\partial_a)^\\mu (\\partial_\\mu (\\partial_t)^\\lambda + \\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\mu\\nu} (\\partial_t)^\\nu)\n$$\nIn our coordinate system, the components of the basis vectors are $(\\partial_a)^\\mu = \\delta^\\mu_a$ and $(\\partial_t)^\\nu = \\delta^\\nu_0$. Substituting these into the formula yields:\n$$\n(\\nabla_{\\partial_a} \\partial_t)^\\lambda = \\delta^\\mu_a (\\partial_\\mu \\delta^\\lambda_0 + \\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\mu\\nu} \\delta^\\nu_0) = \\partial_a \\delta^\\lambda_0 + \\Gamma^\\lambda_{a\\nu} \\delta^\\nu_0 = \\partial_a \\delta^\\lambda_0 + \\Gamma^\\lambda_{a0}\n$$\nThe term $\\partial_a \\delta^\\lambda_0$ is the partial derivative of a constant, which is zero. Thus, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\n(\\nabla_{\\partial_a} \\partial_t)^\\lambda = \\Gamma^\\lambda_{a0}\n$$\nNext, we must compute the Christoffel symbols for the given metric. The Christoffel symbols are defined as:\n$$\n\\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\lambda\\sigma} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\sigma} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\sigma} - \\partial_\\sigma g_{\\mu\\nu})\n$$\nIn the given global Cartesian coordinate system, the components of the Minkowski metric $g_{\\mu\\nu} = \\mathrm{diag}(-1, 1, 1, 1)$ are constant throughout spacetime. Consequently, all partial derivatives of the metric components are zero: $\\partial_\\sigma g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$ for all $\\sigma, \\mu, \\nu$. It immediately follows that all Christoffel symbols are zero:\n$$\n\\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\mu\\nu} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into our expression for the covariant derivative, we find:\n$$\n(\\nabla_{\\partial_a} \\partial_t)^\\lambda = \\Gamma^\\lambda_{a0} = 0\n$$\nThis shows that the vector $\\nabla_{\\partial_a} \\partial_t$ is the zero vector for all $a \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\nFinally, we can compute the components of the extrinsic curvature tensor:\n$$\nK_{ab} = g(\\nabla_{\\partial_a} \\partial_t, \\partial_b) = g(0, \\partial_b) = 0\n$$\nSince this holds for all components $a, b \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, the extrinsic curvature tensor of the hypersurfaces $\\Sigma_t$ is the zero tensor. This result is expected, as the hypersurfaces are flat hyperplanes embedded in a flat spacetime, indicating no \"bending\" relative to the ambient space.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2987637"}, {"introduction": "A primary achievement of the ADM formalism is providing a rigorous definition for the total mass-energy of an isolated system, a quantity known as the ADM mass.
