            "introduction": "Building new topological spaces from existing ones is a core activity in topology. This exercise explores how the property of contractibility behaves when we take the product of two spaces. The key principle is that a homotopy on a product space can often be constructed \"coordinate-wise\" from homotopies on the factor spaces, a technique this problem asks you to verify. This practice reinforces the formal definition of a homotopy and solidifies your understanding of how to work with the fundamental construction of product spaces .",

            "problem": "In algebraic topology, a topological space $X$ is said to be **contractible** if it is homotopy equivalent to a point. More formally, a space $X$ is contractible if the identity map $\\text{id}_X: X \\to X$, defined by $\\text{id}_X(x) = x$, is homotopic to a constant map $c_{x_0}: X \\to X$, defined by $c_{x_0}(x) = x_0$ for some fixed point $x_0 \\in X$. A **homotopy** between two continuous maps $f, g: A \\to B$ is a continuous function $H: A \\times [0, 1] \\to B$ such that $H(a, 0) = f(a)$ and $H(a, 1) = g(a)$ for all $a \\in A$.\n\nLet $X$ and $Y$ be two contractible topological spaces.

            "solution": "To determine the correct statement, we will analyze each option in the context of the topological space $X = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{p\\}$. Without loss of generality, let's assume $p$ is the origin $(0,0)$.\n\nA space is contractible if and only if it is homotopy equivalent to a single point. Properties like the fundamental group type and contractibility are homotopy invariants, meaning that if two spaces are homotopy equivalent, they share these properties. A key tool is the deformation retraction, which is a specific type of homotopy equivalence.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**A. Any continuous map $f: S^1 \\to X$ from the circle $S^1$ to the space $X$ can be continuously extended to a map $\\tilde{f}: D^2 \\to X$ defined on the solid disk $D^2$.**\nThis statement is the definition of a space being simply connected, or more precisely, that every loop in the space is nullhomotopic. If this were true, the fundamental group of $X$ would be trivial. However, consider a map $f: S^1 \\to X$ that parameterizes a simple loop in $X$ that encloses the removed point $p$. For example, if $p=(0,0)$, the map $t \\mapsto (\\cos(2\\pi t), \\sin(2\\pi t))$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ represents such a loop. This loop cannot be continuously shrunk to a point within $X$ without passing through $p$. Therefore, this loop cannot be extended to a map from the disk $D^2$ into $X$. The statement is false.\n\n**B. The fundamental group $\\pi_1(X, x_0)$ is the trivial group for any choice of basepoint $x_0 \\in X$.**\nThis statement is false. As argued in A, there exists at least one loop in $X$ (any loop winding around $p$) that is not nullhomotopic. The existence of such a loop implies that the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X, x_0)$ is not the trivial group $\\{e\\}$. In fact, it is a classic result that the space $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{p\\}$ has a fundamental group isomorphic to the integers, $\\pi_1(X, x_0) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Since a contractible space must have a trivial fundamental group, the non-triviality of $\\pi_1(X)$ is precisely the reason $X$ is not contractible.\n\n**C. The space $X$ is homotopy equivalent to the unit circle $S^1$.**\nThis statement is true. We can show that $X = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{p\\}$ deformation retracts onto any circle $S$ centered at $p$ and contained in $X$. For instance, let $p = (0,0)$ and let $S^1$ be the unit circle. The map $H: X \\times [0,1] \\to X$ defined by $H(v, t) = (1-t)v + t \\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}$ is a deformation retraction of $X$ onto $S^1$. This map continuously shrinks every point in $X$ along a radial line to a point on the unit circle. A deformation retraction is a homotopy equivalence. So, $X$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^1$. It is known that $S^1$ is not contractible (its fundamental group is $\\mathbb{Z}$). Since contractibility is a homotopy invariant, it follows that $X$ is also not contractible.\n\n**D. The space $X$ must be contractible because it is homeomorphic to the cylinder $S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$, and the topological product of any space with the contractible space $\\mathbb{R}$ is always contractible.**\nThis statement is false. It contains two parts: a claim of homeomorphism and a conclusion based on it.\nFirstly, $X = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{p\\}$ is indeed homeomorphic to the cylinder $S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$. Using polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ for $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$, the map $(r, \\theta) \\mapsto (\\ln(r), \\theta)$ where $r \\in (0, \\infty)$ is a homeomorphism from $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$ to $\\mathbb{R} \\times S^1$.\nSecondly, the reasoning that follows is flawed. The product of a space $A$ with a contractible space $B$ is *not* always contractible. It is, however, homotopy equivalent to $A$. In our case, $S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^1$. Since $S^1$ is not contractible, $S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is also not contractible. The statement draws a false conclusion from a property of products. Therefore, the entire statement is false.\n\n**E. Any two continuous maps from an arbitrary path-connected space $Y$ into $X$ are homotopic to each other.**\nThis statement is a defining property of contractible spaces. If a space $X$ is contractible, then its identity map $\\text{id}_X$ is homotopic to a constant map $c_x: X \\to X$. For any two maps $f, g: Y \\to X$, we have $f = \\text{id}_X \\circ f \\simeq c_x \\circ f$, which is a constant map. Similarly, $g \\simeq c_{x'} \\circ g$, another constant map. Since $X$ is path-connected (which is implied by contractibility), any two constant maps into $X$ are homotopic. Thus, $f \\simeq g$.\nConversely, if this property holds, we can choose $Y=X$, $f=\\text{id}_X$, and $g$ to be a constant map. Then $f \\simeq g$, which means $X$ is contractible.\nSince we know $X = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{p\\}$ is not contractible, this property does not hold for $X$. Thus, the statement is false.\n\nBased on the analysis, only statement C is correct.",
