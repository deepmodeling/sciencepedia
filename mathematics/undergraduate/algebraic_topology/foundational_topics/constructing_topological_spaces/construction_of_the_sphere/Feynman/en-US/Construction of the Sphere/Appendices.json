By imagining the disk as a piece of cloth, we can 'zip up' its boundary in a specific way to create a three-dimensional shape.

            "solution": "The goal is to identify the topological space $X = D^2/\\sim$. We will show that $X$ is homeomorphic to the 2-sphere, $S^2$. We can define the 2-sphere as the unit sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, i.e., $S^2 = \\{ (a,b,c) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mid a^2+b^2+c^2 = 1 \\}$. To prove that $X$ is homeomorphic to $S^2$, we will construct a continuous, surjective map $F: D^2 \\to S^2$ that respects the equivalence relation $\\sim$. This means that $F(p_1) = F(p_2)$ if and only if $p_1 \\sim p_2$. Such a map induces a continuous bijection $\\bar{F}: X \\to S^2$. Since $D^2$ is compact and the quotient map $\\pi: D^2 \\to X$ is continuous, $X$ is compact. As $S^2$ is a Hausdorff space, the continuous bijection $\\bar{F}$ from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism.\n\nLet's first develop a geometric intuition for the quotient space $X$. We can think of the disk $D^2$ as a collection of vertical line segments. For each $x \\in [-1, 1]$, let $L_x$ be the line segment defined by $L_x = \\{ (x, y) \\mid -\\sqrt{1-x^2} \\le y \\le \\sqrt{1-x^2} \\}$. The disk $D^2$ is the union of all such segments $L_x$.\n\nThe equivalence relation $\\sim$ does not affect the interior points of the disk. The identification happens on the boundary $S^1$. For a given $x \\in (-1, 1)$, the endpoints of the segment $L_x$ are $(x, \\sqrt{1-x^2})$ and $(x, -\\sqrt{1-x^2})$. These are points on the boundary of the disk. The relation $(x,y) \\sim (x,-y)$ for boundary points implies that these two endpoints of $L_x$ are identified in the quotient space $X$.\n\nFor each $x \\in (-1, 1)$, the line segment $L_x$ becomes a circle in the quotient space $X$, because its two endpoints are glued together. Let's call this circle $C_x$. The circumference of $C_x$ is equal to the length of the segment $L_x$, which is $2\\sqrt{1-x^2}$.\n\nWhat happens at the extremities $x = 1$ and $x = -1$?\nFor $x=1$, the segment $L_1$ is just the point $(1,0)$. The identification is trivial, $(1,0) \\sim (1,-0) = (1,0)$. So, $L_1$ becomes a single point in $X$. This corresponds to a circle $C_1$ of zero radius.\nFor $x=-1$, the segment $L_{-1}$ is the point $(-1,0)$. Similarly, this becomes a single point in $X$, a circle $C_{-1}$ of zero radius.\n\nThe space $X$ can therefore be visualized as a collection of circles $C_x$ parameterized by $x \\in [-1,1]$. The circles are stacked along the x-axis, with the largest circle at $x=0$ (corresponding to the vertical diameter of the disk) and the circles shrinking to points at $x=\\pm 1$. This geometric shape is a sphere.\n\nNow, we make this argument rigorous by constructing the map $F: D^2 \\to S^2$. Let $(x,y)$ be a point in $D^2$. We want to map this to a point $(a,b,c)$ on $S^2$. Inspired by our geometric intuition, we can map the `x`-coordinate of the disk to the `c`-coordinate (height) of the sphere. Let $c = x$.\nFor a fixed $x$, the segment $L_x$ in the disk is mapped to a circle of constant height $c=x$ on the sphere. This is a circle of latitude. The points on this circle are parameterized by the $y$ coordinate. The mapping from the interval $[-\\sqrt{1-x^2}, \\sqrt{1-x^2}]$ for $y$ to a circle must be such that the endpoints $y=\\sqrt{1-x^2}$ and $y=-\\sqrt{1-x^2}$ map to the same point.\nLet's define an angle $\\psi$ that depends on $y$. A natural choice is to scale $y$ to fit the range of an angle, say $[-\\pi, \\pi]$. Let $\\psi = \\pi \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}$ for $x \\in (-1,1)$. When $y=\\sqrt{1-x^2}$, $\\psi=\\pi$. When $y=-\\sqrt{1-x^2}$, $\\psi=-\\pi$. Since $\\cos(\\pi)=\\cos(-\\pi)$ and $\\sin(\\pi)=\\sin(-\\pi)=0$, this will ensure the endpoints map to the same location.\n\nThe coordinates on the sphere for a given height $c=x$ are $a = \\sqrt{1-c^2}\\cos\\psi$ and $b = \\sqrt{1-c^2}\\sin\\psi$. Substituting $c=x$ and our expression for $\\psi$, we define our map $F: D^2 \\to S^2$ for $x \\in (-1,1)$ as:\n$$ F(x,y) = \\left( \\sqrt{1-x^2} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi y}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}\\right), \\sqrt{1-x^2} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi y}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}\\right), x \\right) $$\nWe must also define the map for $x=\\pm 1$.\nAs $(x,y) \\to (1,0)$, we have $\\sqrt{1-x^2} \\to 0$. The arguments to sin and cos are bounded, so the first two components of $F(x,y)$ approach 0. The third component approaches 1. So, we define $F(1,0) = (0,0,1)$.\nSimilarly, as $(x,y) \\to (-1,0)$, we define $F(-1,0) = (0,0,-1)$.\nThe map $F$ is continuous on all of $D^2$.\n\nNext, we verify that $F$ respects the equivalence relation $\\sim$. The relation is non-trivial only on the boundary, where $y^2 = 1 - x^2$, so $y = \\pm \\sqrt{1-x^2}$. Let $p_1 = (x, \\sqrt{1-x^2})$ and $p_2 = (x, -\\sqrt{1-x^2})$.\n$$ F(p_1) = F(x, \\sqrt{1-x^2}) = (\\sqrt{1-x^2}\\cos(\\pi), \\sqrt{1-x^2}\\sin(\\pi), x) = (-\\sqrt{1-x^2}, 0, x) $$\n$$ F(p_2) = F(x, -\\sqrt{1-x^2}) = (\\sqrt{1-x^2}\\cos(-\\pi), \\sqrt{1-x^2}\\sin(-\\pi), x) = (-\\sqrt{1-x^2}, 0, x) $$\nThus, $F(p_1) = F(p_2)$, which shows that $F$ is constant on the equivalence classes of the boundary points. For interior points, the equivalence classes are singletons, so the condition is trivially satisfied.\n\nThe map $F$ is also surjective. Given any point $(a,b,c) \\in S^2$, we can find a preimage $(x,y) \\in D^2$. We set $x=c$. If $c=\\pm 1$, the preimage is $(\\pm 1, 0)$. If $c \\in (-1,1)$, then $\\sqrt{1-c^2} > 0$. We can find a unique angle $\\psi \\in (-\\pi, \\pi]$ such that $\\cos\\psi = a/\\sqrt{1-c^2}$ and $\\sin\\psi = b/\\sqrt{1-c^2}$. Then we solve for $y$ using $\\psi = \\pi y / \\sqrt{1-c^2}$, which gives $y = (\\psi/\\pi)\\sqrt{1-c^2}$. Since $|\\psi| \\le \\pi$, we have $|y| \\le \\sqrt{1-c^2} = \\sqrt{1-x^2}$, so the point $(x,y)$ is in $D^2$.\n\nThe map $F$ is injective on the interior of the disk. If $F(x_1, y_1) = F(x_2, y_2)$, then $x_1 = x_2$. This implies that the arguments to the trigonometric functions must match (up to $2\\pi k$), which leads to $y_1=y_2$. Thus $F$ is one-to-one on the interior.\nWe have shown that $F(p_1) = F(p_2)$ if and only if $p_1 \\sim p_2$.\n\nBy the universal property of quotient spaces, $F$ induces a continuous bijection $\\bar{F}: X = D^2/\\sim \\to S^2$. Since $X$ is the continuous image of the compact space $D^2$, it is compact. $S^2$ is a Hausdorff space. A continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism.\nTherefore, $X$ is homeomorphic to $S^2$.\n\nThe other options are incorrect. For instance, $\\mathbb{R}P^2$ is obtained by identifying antipodal points on the boundary of the disk, i.e., $(x,y) \\sim (-x,-y)$, which is a different identification. The torus $T^2$ and Klein bottle are usually constructed from a square and have different topological properties (e.g., their fundamental groups are different from the trivial group of $S^2$).",

            "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether space $C^n$ and space $O^n$ are homeomorphic to the standard n-sphere $S^n$. Two topological spaces are homeomorphic if there exists a continuous bijection between them whose inverse is also continuous. We will investigate each case separately by constructing an explicit homeomorphism. The geometric intuition behind these constructions is to radially project points from one sphere onto another.\n\n**Part I: Homeomorphism between $S^n$ and $C^n$**\n\nLet's define a map $f: S^n \\to C^n$. For any point $x \\in S^n$, we can find a corresponding point on $C^n$ by moving along the ray from the origin through $x$. We define the map as:\n$$f(x) = \\frac{x}{\\|x\\|_{\\infty}}$$\nWe must verify that this map is a homeomorphism.\n\n1.  **Well-defined:** For any $x = (x_0, \\dots, x_n) \\in S^n$, we have $\\|x\\|_2 = 1$. This implies $x$ is not the zero vector, so at least one component $x_i$ is non-zero. Therefore, $\\|x\\|_{\\infty} = \\max|x_i| > 0$. The map $f$ is well-defined. To show that $f(x)$ is in $C^n$, we compute its maximum norm:\n    $$\\|f(x)\\|_{\\infty} = \\left\\|\\frac{x}{\\|x\\|_{\\infty}}\\right\\|_{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{\\|x\\|_{\\infty}} \\|x\\|_{\\infty} = 1$$\n    Thus, for any $x \\in S^n$, its image $f(x)$ lies in $C^n$.\n\n2.  **Continuity of $f$:** The function $x \\mapsto \\|x\\|_{\\infty}$ is a norm on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and is therefore a continuous function. Since $x \\in S^n$, $\\|x\\|_\\infty$ is never zero. The map $f(x)$ is constructed from scalar multiplication and division by a non-zero continuous function, which are continuous operations. Therefore, $f$ is a continuous map.\n\n3.  **Constructing the inverse map:** Let's define a map $g: C^n \\to S^n$ in a similar fashion:\n    $$g(y) = \\frac{y}{\\|y\\|_{2}}$$\n    This map takes a point $y$ on the hypercube sphere and projects it radially onto the standard sphere.\n\n4.  **Well-definedness and Continuity of $g$:** For any $y \\in C^n$, $\\|y\\|_{\\infty} = 1$, which implies $y$ is not the zero vector, so its Euclidean norm $\\|y\\|_{2}$ is strictly positive. The map $g$ is well-defined. To show $g(y) \\in S^n$, we compute its Euclidean norm:\n    $$\\|g(y)\\|_{2} = \\left\\|\\frac{y}{\\|y\\|_{2}}\\right\\|_{2} = \\frac{1}{\\|y\\|_{2}} \\|y\\|_{2} = 1$$\n    So $g(y)$ lies in $S^n$. The continuity of $g$ follows from the same reasoning as for $f$: the map $y \\mapsto \\|y\\|_{2}$ is continuous and non-zero on $C^n$.\n\n5.  **Verifying $g$ is the inverse of $f$:** We must check that $g(f(x)) = x$ and $f(g(y)) = y$.\n    For $x \\in S^n$:\n    $$g(f(x)) = g\\left(\\frac{x}{\\|x\\|_{\\infty}}\\right) = \\frac{x/\\|x\\|_{\\infty}}{\\|x/\\|x\\|_{\\infty}\\|_{2}} = \\frac{x/\\|x\\|_{\\infty}}{(1/\\|x\\|_{\\infty})\\|x\\|_{2}} = \\frac{x}{\\|x\\|_{2}}$$\n    Since $x \\in S^n$, we have $\\|x\\|_2=1$, so $g(f(x)) = x$.\n    For $y \\in C^n$:\n    $$f(g(y)) = f\\left(\\frac{y}{\\|y\\|_{2}}\\right) = \\frac{y/\\|y\\|_{2}}{\\|y/\\|y\\|_{2}\\|_{\\infty}} = \\frac{y/\\|y\\|_{2}}{(1/\\|y\\|_{2})\\|y\\|_{\\infty}} = \\frac{y}{\\|y\\|_{\\infty}}$$\n    Since $y \\in C^n$, we have $\\|y\\|_\\infty=1$, so $f(g(y)) = y$.\n    Since $f$ is a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse $g$, $S^n$ is homeomorphic to $C^n$. Thus, statement I is correct.\n\n**Part II: Homeomorphism between $S^n$ and $O^n$**\n\nThe logic is identical to Part I, but we replace the maximum norm with the taxicab norm. Let's define a map $h: S^n \\to O^n$:\n$$h(x) = \\frac{x}{\\|x\\|_{1}}$$\n\n1.  **Well-definedness and Continuity:** For $x \\in S^n$, $x \\neq 0$, so $\\|x\\|_1 > 0$. The map $h$ is well-defined. To check that $h(x) \\in O^n$:\n    $$\\|h(x)\\|_{1} = \\left\\|\\frac{x}{\\|x\\|_{1}}\\right\\|_{1} = \\frac{1}{\\|x\\|_{1}} \\|x\\|_{1} = 1$$\n    The map is continuous because $x \\mapsto \\|x\\|_1$ is a continuous function which is non-zero on $S^n$.\n\n2.  **Constructing the inverse map:** We define $k: O^n \\to S^n$ as:\n    $$k(y) = \\frac{y}{\\|y\\|_{2}}$$\n    This is the same functional form as the map $g$ in Part I, but with a different domain.\n\n3.  **Well-definedness, Continuity, and Inverse Property:** The map $k$ is well-defined and continuous for the same reasons $g$ was. We check that $k$ is the inverse of $h$.\n    For $x \\in S^n$:\n    $$k(h(x)) = k\\left(\\frac{x}{\\|x\\|_{1}}\\right) = \\frac{x/\\|x\\|_{1}}{\\|x/\\|x\\|_{1}\\|_{2}} = \\frac{x/\\|x\\|_{1}}{(1/\\|x\\|_{1})\\|x\\|_{2}} = \\frac{x}{\\|x\\|_{2}} = x$$\n    For $y \\in O^n$:\n    $$h(k(y)) = h\\left(\\frac{y}{\\|y\\|_{2}}\\right) = \\frac{y/\\|y\\|_{2}}{\\|y/\\|y\\|_{2}\\|_{1}} = \\frac{y/\\|y\\|_{2}}{(1/\\|y\\|_{2})\\|y\\|_{1}} = \\frac{y}{\\|y\\|_{1}}$$\n    Since $y \\in O^n$, we have $\\|y\\|_1=1$, so $h(k(y)) = y$.\n    Thus, $h$ is a homeomorphism between $S^n$ and $O^n$. Statement II is also correct.\n\nSince both the hypercube sphere $C^n$ and the cross-polytope sphere $O^n$ are homeomorphic to the standard sphere $S^n$, the correct option is C.",
