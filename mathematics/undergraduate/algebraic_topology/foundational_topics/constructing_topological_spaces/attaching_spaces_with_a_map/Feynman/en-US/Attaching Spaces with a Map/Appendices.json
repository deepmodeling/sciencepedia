A new topological space, which we will call $X$, is constructed by attaching the interval $I$ to the torus $T^2$. The attachment is made by identifying the two endpoints of the interval, $0$ and $1$, with two distinct points, $p$ and $q$ respectively, on the torus.\n\nMore formally, $X$ is the quotient space $(T^2 \\sqcup I) / \\sim$, where $\\sqcup$ denotes the disjoint union and $\\sim$ is the smallest equivalence relation generated by the identifications $0 \\sim p$ and $1 \\sim q$.\n\nWhich of the following well-known topological spaces is homotopy equivalent to the space $X$?\n\nA.

The space $X$ is obtained by attaching a $1$-cell $I$ by identifying $\\{0,1\\}$ with $\\{p,q\\}$, i.e., by an attaching map $f:S^{0}\\to Y$ sending the two points of $S^{0}$ to $p$ and $q$.\n\nConsider the subspace $B=\\gamma([0,1])\\cup I\\subset X$. This is a graph with two vertices $p,q$ and two edges $\\gamma$ and $I$ connecting them. Such a graph has exactly one cycle and deformation retracts onto the loop obtained by traversing $I$ from $p$ to $q$ and then $\\gamma$ from $q$ back to $p$. Hence $B\\simeq S^{1}$.\n\nNow consider the quotient $c_{\\gamma}:Y\\to Y/\\gamma$ that collapses the contractible subspace $\\gamma([0,1])$ to a point. After subdividing $Y$ to regard $\\gamma([0,1])$ as a subcomplex, the standard CW-complex fact applies: collapsing a contractible subcomplex induces a homotopy equivalence. Therefore $c_{\\gamma}$ is a homotopy equivalence and $Y/\\gamma\\simeq Y=T^{2}$.\n\nUse these two homotopy equivalences on the corresponding subspaces inside $X$: collapse $\\gamma([0,1])$ to a point inside $Y$ and deformation retract $B$ onto the loop described above. In the resulting space, the image of $Y$ is $Y/\\gamma$, the image of $B$ is $S^{1}$, and their intersection is a single point (the image of $\\gamma([0,1])$), so the space is the wedge $(Y/\\gamma)\\vee S^{1}$. Since both operations are homotopy equivalences carried out on subspaces that assemble along cofibrations, the induced map\n$$\nX\\longrightarrow (Y/\\gamma)\\vee S^{1}\n$$\nis a homotopy equivalence. Composing with a homotopy inverse of $c_{\\gamma}$ yields\n$$\nX\\simeq T^{2}\\vee S^{1}.\n$$\n\nAs a verification by invariants, attaching a $1$-cell along $S^{0}$ to a path-connected space adds a free generator to the fundamental group and no $2$-cells, so by Seifert–van Kampen,\n$$\n\\pi_{1}(X)\\cong\\pi_{1}(T^{2})*\\mathbb{Z}\\cong(\\mathbb{Z}\\times\\mathbb{Z})*\\mathbb{Z},\n$$\nwhich equals $\\pi_{1}(T^{2}\\vee S^{1})$, and by cellular homology $H_{2}(X;\\mathbb{Z})\\cong H_{2}(T^{2};\\mathbb{Z})\\cong\\mathbb{Z}$, matching $H_{2}(T^{2}\\vee S^{1};\\mathbb{Z})$.

The adjunction space is\n$$\nY \\;=\\; X \\cup_{\\phi} D^{2}.\n$$\nBy the definition of pushout, the image of $\\partial D^{2}$ in $Y$ is identified homeomorphically with the $S^{1}$ summand in $X$. Hence, in $Y$, the subset $S^{1}\\cup_{\\mathrm{id}} D^{2}$ is just $D^{2}$ (the circle is identified with the boundary of the disk and adds no extra points).

Define a homotopy $H: D^{2}\\times I\\to D^{2}$ by\n$$\nH(u,s) \\;=\\; (1-s)u + s b,\n$$\nwhere $I=[0,1]$. Since $D^{2}$ is convex, $H(u,s)\\in D^{2}$ for all $u\\in D^{2}$ and $s\\in I$, and $H(b,s)=b$ for all $s$, so the wedge point is fixed throughout. Extend this to a homotopy $F:Y\\times I\\to Y$ by\n$$\nF(y,s) \\;=\\; \\begin{cases}\ny, & y\\in T^{2},\\\\\nH(y,s), & y\\in D^{2}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis is continuous because $T^{2}\\cap D^{2}=\\{p_{0}\\}$ and $H$ fixes $b=p_{0}$.

In particular, $Y$ is not homeomorphic to $T^{2}$ (it has a nonmanifold wedge point), and while $Y$ is homotopy equivalent to $T^{2}$, the stronger assertion of a deformation retraction holds.",
