The **final topology**, $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$, is constructed as follows: Let $\\mathcal{P}$ be the family of all real polynomial functions $p: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$. We equip the domain of each polynomial with the standard topology, $(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{T}_{std})$. The final topology $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$ on the codomain $\\mathbb{R}$ is defined such that a subset $V \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ is open in $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$ if and only if the preimage $p^{-1}(V)$ is an open set in $(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{T}_{std})$ for every polynomial $p \\in \\mathcal{P}$.\n\nBased on these definitions, determine the relationship between the final topology $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$ and the cofinite topology $\\mathcal{T}_{C}$.\n\nA.

            "solution": "The goal is to determine the relationship between the final topology $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$ and the cofinite topology $\\mathcal{T}_{C}$. The most direct way to do this is to first identify the final topology $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$ explicitly and then compare it to $\\mathcal{T}_{C}$.\n\nBy the problem's definition, the final topology $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$ on the codomain $\\mathbb{R}$ is induced by the family of all polynomial functions $\\mathcal{P} = \\{p: (\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{T}_{std}) \\to \\mathbb{R}\\}$. A set $U \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ is open in $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$ if and only if for every polynomial $p \\in \\mathcal{P}$, the preimage $p^{-1}(U)$ is an open set in the standard topology $\\mathcal{T}_{std}$.\n\nLet's first establish the identity of $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$. We will do this by comparing it with the standard topology $\\mathcal{T}_{std}$.\n\n**Part 1: Show that $\\mathcal{T}_{std} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}_{F}$**\nLet $U$ be an arbitrary open set in the standard topology, i.e., $U \\in \\mathcal{T}_{std}$. We need to check if $U$ is also in $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$. According to the definition of $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$, this is true if $p^{-1}(U)$ is open in $\\mathcal{T}_{std}$ for every polynomial $p \\in \\mathcal{P}$.\n\nAny real polynomial function $p: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function when both the domain and codomain are equipped with the standard topology $\\mathcal{T}_{std}$. By the topological definition of continuity, a function is continuous if the preimage of every open set in the codomain is an open set in the domain.\nSince $p: (\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{T}_{std}) \\to (\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{T}_{std})$ is continuous and $U$ is an open set in the codomain's topology $\\mathcal{T}_{std}$, its preimage $p^{-1}(U)$ must be an open set in the domain's topology $\\mathcal{T}_{std}$.\nThis holds for any polynomial $p \\in \\mathcal{P}$. Therefore, by the definition of the final topology, $U$ must be an open set in $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$.\nSince this is true for any $U \\in \\mathcal{T}_{std}$, we have shown that $\\mathcal{T}_{std} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}_{F}$.\n\n**Part 2: Show that $\\mathcal{T}_{F} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}_{std}$**\nLet $V$ be an arbitrary open set in the final topology, i.e., $V \\in \\mathcal{T}_{F}$. By definition, this means that $p^{-1}(V)$ is open in $\\mathcal{T}_{std}$ for *all* polynomials $p \\in \\mathcal{P}$.\n\nThe family of polynomials $\\mathcal{P}$ is very large. We can choose a specific, simple polynomial from this family to gain insight. Let's consider the identity polynomial, $p(x) = x$. This is a polynomial of degree one, so it belongs to $\\mathcal{P}$.\nFor this particular choice of $p$, the preimage of the set $V$ is:\n$$p^{-1}(V) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid p(x) \\in V\\} = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid x \\in V\\} = V$$\nSince $V$ is in $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$, we know that its preimage under *any* polynomial, including our chosen $p(x)=x$, must be open in $\\mathcal{T}_{std}$. Thus, we must have $p^{-1}(V) \\in \\mathcal{T}_{std}$.\nAs we just showed $p^{-1}(V) = V$, it follows directly that $V \\in \\mathcal{T}_{std}$.\nSince this holds for any $V \\in \\mathcal{T}_{F}$, we have shown that $\\mathcal{T}_{F} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}_{std}$.\n\n**Part 3: Conclude the identity of $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$**\nFrom Part 1 ($\\mathcal{T}_{std} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}_{F}$) and Part 2 ($\\mathcal{T}_{F} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}_{std}$), we can conclude that the final topology $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$ is identical to the standard topology $\\mathcal{T}_{std}$.\n$$ \\mathcal{T}_{F} = \\mathcal{T}_{std} $$\n\n**Part 4: Compare $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$ with $\\mathcal{T}_{C}$**\nNow we compare $\\mathcal{T}_{F} = \\mathcal{T}_{std}$ with the cofinite topology $\\mathcal{T}_{C}$.\n\nFirst, let's check if $\\mathcal{T}_{C} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}_{F}$. Let $W$ be an open set in the cofinite topology $\\mathcal{T}_{C}$. If $W = \\emptyset$, it is also in $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$ (since the empty set is in every topology). If $W \\neq \\emptyset$, its complement $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus W$ is a finite set, say $\\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n\\}$. In the standard topology $\\mathcal{T}_{std}$, any finite set is a closed set. Therefore, $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus W$ is closed in $\\mathcal{T}_{std}$. The complement of a closed set is open, so $W$ is open in $\\mathcal{T}_{std}$. Since $\\mathcal{T}_{F} = \\mathcal{T}_{std}$, this means $W$ is open in $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$. Thus, every open set in $\\mathcal{T}_{C}$ is also open in $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$, which means $\\mathcal{T}_{C} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}_{F}$.\n\nNext, we check if the inclusion is strict, i.e., if $\\mathcal{T}_{F} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}_{C}$ is false. To do this, we need to find a set that is in $\\mathcal{T}_{F}$ but not in $\\mathcal{T}_{C}$.\nConsider the open interval $U = (0, 1)$. This is a standard example of an open set in $\\mathcal{T}_{std}$. Since $\\mathcal{T}_{F} = \\mathcal{T}_{std}$, we have $U \\in \\mathcal{T}_{F}$.\nNow, let's check if $U$ is in $\\mathcal{T}_{C}$. A set is open in $\\mathcal{T}_{C}$ if its complement is finite. The complement of $U$ is $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus (0, 1) = (-\\infty, 0] \\cup [1, \\infty)$. This set is clearly infinite. Therefore, by the definition of the cofinite topology, $U = (0,1)$ is not an open set in $\\mathcal{T}_{C}$.\n\nWe have found a set $U=(0,1)$ such that $U \\in \\mathcal{T}_{F}$ but $U \\notin \\mathcal{T}_{C}$. This proves that the inclusion is strict.\n\nCombining our findings, we have $\\mathcal{T}_{C} \\subsetneq \\mathcal{T}_{F}$. This means the cofinite topology is strictly coarser (or weaker) than the final topology. This corresponds to option B.",
