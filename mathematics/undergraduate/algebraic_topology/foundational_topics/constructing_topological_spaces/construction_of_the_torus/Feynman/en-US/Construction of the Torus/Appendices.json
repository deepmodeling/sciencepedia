This process is formalized by defining an equivalence relation $\\sim$ on $X$. The relation is generated by the following two rules of identification:\n\n1. For any real number $x$ such that $0 \\le x \\le 1$, the point $(x, 0)$ is identified with the point $(x, 1)$. This is written as $(x, 0) \\sim (x, 1)$.\n2.

Therefore, no further identifications arise via rule 2 or any transitive chain involving it, since every application of rule 2 requires a point with $x=0$ or $x=1$, and neither $(\\tfrac{1}{2},0)$ nor $(\\tfrac{1}{2},1)$ can be connected to such a point by rule 1 (which preserves the $x$-coordinate and only flips $y$ between $0$ and $1$).\n\nHence the complete equivalence class of $(\\tfrac{1}{2},0)$ contains exactly the two points $(\\tfrac{1}{2},0)$ and $(\\tfrac{1}{2},1)$, which corresponds to option C.",

For a function initially defined on the unit square to be meaningful on the torus, it must be consistent with the edge identifications—that is, it must assign the same value to all points that are glued together.
