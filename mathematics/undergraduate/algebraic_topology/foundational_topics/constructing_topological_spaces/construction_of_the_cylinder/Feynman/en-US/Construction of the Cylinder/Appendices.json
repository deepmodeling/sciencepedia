For a continuous map $f: X \\to Y$ between two topological spaces $X$ and $Y$, the mapping cylinder of $f$, denoted $M_f$, is defined as the quotient space obtained from the disjoint union of the cylinder on $X$ (the product space $X \\times [0, 1]$) and the space $Y$.\n\nSpecifically, $M_f$ is the quotient of the disjoint union $(X \\times [0, 1]) \\sqcup Y$ under the equivalence relation $\\sim$ generated by identifying each point $(x, 1) \\in X \\times [0, 1]$ with its image $f(x) \\in Y$ for all $x \\in X$.\n\nConsider the unique continuous map $f: \\emptyset \\to Y$, where $\\emptyset$ is the empty set and $Y$ is an arbitrary non-empty topological space.

            "problem": "Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces. The **mapping cylinder** of a continuous map $f: X \\to Y$, denoted $M_f$, is the quotient space obtained from the disjoint union of the cylinder $X \\times [0, 1]$ and the space $Y$ by identifying each point $(x, 1)$ on the top of the cylinder with its image $f(x) \\in Y$.

            "introduction": "The true power of the mapping cylinder often lies in its ability to simplify topological problems. This exercise presents a concrete example—modeling a drum by attaching a membrane ($D^2$) to a cylinder—which is precisely the mapping cylinder of an inclusion map. By analyzing this space , we see how the construction provides a standard way to study maps through the lens of homotopy, often greatly simplifying the calculation of invariants like the fundamental group.",

            "problem": "Consider a simplified topological model for a drum. This model is constructed from two abstract components: a perfectly flexible, hollow cylindrical shell that is open at both ends, and a flat, circular membrane. The drum is formed by attaching the boundary of the membrane to one of the circular openings of the shell, creating a sealed-off \"topological cup\".\n\nMore formally, let the cylindrical shell be represented by the space $C = S^1 \\times [0, 1]$, where $S^1$ is the unit circle in the complex plane, defined as $S^1 = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid |z| = 1\\}$.

This is because the cylinder part $X \\times [0,1]$ can be \"squashed\" up into $Y$ via a deformation retraction.\n\nIn our case, the space $X = M_i$ is homotopy equivalent to the codomain of the map $i$, which is the disk $D^2$. A deformation retraction $H: X \\times [0,1] \\to X$ can be explicitly defined. For points in the cylinder part $[(z,t)] \\in X$, the retraction slides them up to the top: $H([(z,t)], s) = [(z, (1-s)t + s)]$. For points already in the disk $[p] \\in X$, they remain fixed: $H([p], s) = [p]$. At time $s=1$, every point in the cylinder part has been mapped to a point of the form $[(z,1)]$, which is identified with a point $i(z)$ in $D^2$. Thus, the entire space $X$ retracts onto its subspace $D^2$.\n\nSince $X$ is homotopy equivalent to $D^2$, they must have the same fundamental group:\n$$\n\\pi_{1}(X) \\cong \\pi_{1}(D^{2}).\n$$\nThe closed disk $D^2$ is a contractible space, meaning it is homotopy equivalent to a single point.
