            "problem": "The Klein bottle is a fascinating non-orientable surface that can be constructed from a square by identifying pairs of its edges in a specific way. This process is formally described by defining a fundamental polygon and its edge identifications. The fundamental group of the resulting surface, which captures information about its essential loops, can be determined by reading the word formed by traversing the boundary of this polygon.\n\nConsider the construction of a Klein bottle from a square fundamental polygon. The identifications are as follows:\n1.  The left vertical edge is identified with the right vertical edge, with their directions aligned (e.g., both pointing upwards). The topological loop formed by this identification is represented by the generator $a$.\n2.  The bottom horizontal edge is identified with the top horizontal edge, but with their directions opposite to one another, creating a twist (e.g., the bottom edge is oriented rightwards, while the top edge is oriented leftwards). The topological loop formed by this identification is represented by the generator $b$.\n\nBy starting at the bottom-left corner of the square and moving along its boundary in a counter-clockwise direction, one obtains a sequence of generators and their inverses. This sequence, read as a word, represents the relation in the fundamental group $\\pi_1(K)$ of the Klein bottle, $K$.\n\nYour task is to determine this boundary word. Express your answer as a single, unsimplified word using only the symbols $a$, $b$, and their inverses, $a^{-1}$ and $b^{-1}$.",
            "solution": "We model the Klein bottle by a square with edge identifications as specified. Assign orientations according to the problem:\n- Vertical edges: both oriented upward and labeled by the generator $a$.\n- Horizontal edges: bottom oriented to the right, top oriented to the left, both labeled by the generator $b$.\n\nTo read the boundary word, we traverse the boundary counter-clockwise starting at the bottom-left corner. The rule is: when our traversal matches an edge’s orientation, we record the corresponding generator; if it is opposite, we record its inverse.\n\nStep-by-step traversal:\n1. Bottom edge: traverse from left to right, which matches its rightward orientation, so record $b$.\n2. Right edge: traverse upward, matching its upward orientation, so record $a$.\n3. Top edge: traverse from right to left, matching its leftward orientation, so record $b$.\n4. Left edge: traverse downward, opposite to its upward orientation, so record $a^{-1}$.\n\nConcatenating in order, the boundary word is $b a b a^{-1}$.",

This practice explores how a simple straight path on the original square transforms when viewed on the completed Klein bottle.

            "problem": "The Klein bottle is a non-orientable surface that can be constructed as a quotient space of a square. Let the unit square in the plane be defined as $S = \\{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid 0 \\le x \\le 1, 0 \\le y \\le 1 \\}$. The Klein bottle, denoted by $K$, is obtained from $S$ by identifying its edges according to the following equivalence relation $\\sim$:\n1. For any $y \\in [0, 1]$, the point $(0, y)$ is identified with the point $(1, y)$. This is written as $(0, y) \\sim (1, y)$.\n2. For any $x \\in [0, 1]$, the point $(x, 0)$ is identified with the point $(1-x, 1)$.
