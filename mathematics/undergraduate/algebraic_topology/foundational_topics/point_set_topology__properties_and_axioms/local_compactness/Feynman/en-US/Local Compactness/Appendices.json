This exercise challenges our intuition by considering the real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$, with the non-standard lower-limit topology, creating the Sorgenfrey line. By investigating this space, you will directly apply the definition of local compactness and discover how a subtle change to the basis of a topology can fundamentally alter a space's local properties.",

            "problem": "Consider the set of real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$, endowed with the lower-limit topology, which is generated by the basis consisting of all half-open intervals of the form $[a, b)$ for $a < b$. This topological space is commonly known as the Sorgenfrey line, denoted $\\mathbb{R}_l$.\n\nA topological space $X$ is defined to be **locally compact** if every point $x \\in X$ has a compact neighborhood. A neighborhood of a point $x$ is any set containing an open set which in turn contains $x$.\n\nWhich of the following statements about the Sorgenfrey line is true?\n\nA. The Sorgenfrey line is locally compact.\n\nB. The Sorgenfrey line is not locally compact.\n\nC. The Sorgenfrey line is locally compact only at the rational points.\n\nD. The Sorgenfrey line is compact.",
            "solution": "We work in the Sorgenfrey line $\\mathbb{R}_{l}$, whose basis consists of all half-open intervals $[a,b)$ with $a<b$.\n\nFirst, observe that every basic interval $[a,b)$ is both open and closed in $\\mathbb{R}_{l}$. It is open by definition of the basis. Its complement is\n$$\n\\mathbb{R}\\setminus [a,b)=(-\\infty,a)\\cup [b,\\infty),\n$$\nand both $(-\\infty,a)$ and $[b,\\infty)$ are open in $\\mathbb{R}_{l}$: if $x<a$, choose $\\epsilon>0$ with $x+\\epsilon<a$, so $[x,x+\\epsilon)\\subset (-\\infty,a)$; if $x\\ge b$, then for any $\\epsilon>0$ we have $[x,x+\\epsilon)\\subset [b,\\infty)$. Hence $[a,b)$ is closed.\n\nNext, we show that no nonempty basic open interval $[a,b)$ is compact. Consider the family\n$$\n\\mathcal{U}=\\{\\, [t,\\tfrac{t+b}{2}) : t\\in [a,b) \\,\\}.\n$$\nEach $[t,\\tfrac{t+b}{2})$ is a basic open set, and for any $x\\in [a,b)$, taking $t=x$ gives $x\\in [x,\\tfrac{x+b}{2})$, so $\\mathcal{U}$ is an open cover of $[a,b)$. Suppose finitely many members $\\{[t_{1},\\tfrac{t_{1}+b}{2}),\\dots,[t_{n},\\tfrac{t_{n}+b}{2})\\}$ are chosen. Let\n$$\nc=\\max_{1\\le i\\le n}\\frac{t_{i}+b}{2}.\n$$\nThen $c<b$, so choose $y$ with $c<y<b$. For every $i$, we have $y\\notin [t_{i},\\tfrac{t_{i}+b}{2})$ because $y>\\tfrac{t_{i}+b}{2}$. Hence $y$ is not covered by the finite subfamily, and therefore $\\mathcal{U}$ has no finite subcover. Thus $[a,b)$ is not compact.\n\nNow assume, for contradiction, that $\\mathbb{R}_{l}$ is locally compact at some $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$. By the given definition, there exists a compact neighborhood $K$ of $x$, meaning there is an open set $U$ with $x\\in U\\subseteq K$ and $K$ is compact. By the basis property at $x$, there exists $\\epsilon>0$ such that the basic open set $[x,x+\\epsilon)\\subseteq U\\subseteq K$. We have already shown $[x,x+\\epsilon)$ is closed in $\\mathbb{R}_{l}$, so it is also closed in the subspace $K$ (since $[x,x+\\epsilon)=K\\cap [x,x+\\epsilon)$). A closed subset of a compact space is compact, hence $[x,x+\\epsilon)$ would be compact, contradicting the noncompactness of basic intervals established above. This contradiction shows that no point has a compact neighborhood.\n\nTherefore, the Sorgenfrey line is not locally compact anywhere. In particular, it is neither locally compact at only rational points nor compact.\n\nThe correct choice is B.",

            "introduction": "Quotient spaces are central to topology, created by 'gluing' parts of a space together, but this process can have unexpected consequences for local properties. This problem asks you to explore a space formed by collapsing the set of all integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ within the real line $\\mathbb{R}$ to a single point.

An equivalence relation $\\sim$ is defined on $\\mathbb{R}$ such that $x \\sim y$ if and only if $x=y$, or if $\\{x, y\\} \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}$, where $\\mathbb{Z}$ is the set of all integers.

            "solution": "We first restate the equivalence relation: for $x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $x \\sim y$ if and only if $x=y$ or $\\{x,y\\} \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}$. Thus every non-integer forms a singleton class, and all integers form one class. Let $\\pi:\\mathbb{R} \\to X=\\mathbb{R}/\\sim$ be the quotient map, and let $p=\\pi(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nWe analyze local compactness pointwise.\n\n1) Points $x \\in X$ with $x \\neq p$. If $x=\\pi(t)$ with $t \\notin \\mathbb{Z}$, choose an open interval $I$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ with $t \\in I$ and $I \\cap \\mathbb{Z}=\\emptyset$. Then $\\pi\\!\\restriction_{I}:I \\to \\pi(I)$ is a homeomorphism, so $\\pi(I)$ is an open neighborhood of $x$ homeomorphic to $I$. Since $I$ is locally compact (as an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}$), $x$ is locally compact.\n\n2) The point $p$. A neighborhood of $p$ in $X$ is of the form $\\pi(U)$ where $U \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ is open and satisfies $\\mathbb{Z} \\subset U$ (because neighborhoods of $p$ are images of saturated opens containing the integer class). We show that no such neighborhood is contained in any compact subset of $X$, hence $p$ has no compact neighborhood and $X$ is not locally compact at $p$.\n\nFix an arbitrary neighborhood $N$ of $p$, so $N=\\pi(U)$ with $U$ open in $\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathbb{Z} \\subset U$. For each $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, choose $\\epsilon_{n} > 0$ such that $(n-\\epsilon_{n},n+\\epsilon_{n}) \\subset U$. Define\n$$\nT=\\left\\{n+\\frac{\\epsilon_{n}}{2} : n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\right\\} \\subset \\mathbb{R}, \\quad S=\\pi(T) \\subset X.\n$$\nThen $T \\subset U \\setminus \\mathbb{Z}$, hence $S \\subset \\pi(U)=N$. We now establish three properties:\n\n- $T$ is closed in $\\mathbb{R}$. For any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, only finitely many integers $n$ satisfy $|n-x| \\leq 2$, hence only finitely many points of $T$ lie in $(x-2,x+2)$. Thus $x$ is not a limit point of $T$ unless $x \\in T$, so $T$ is closed in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n- $S$ is closed in $X$. Since $T$ contains no integers, the equivalence classes of points in $T$ are singletons; hence $\\pi^{-1}(S)=T$. By the quotient topology, a subset $A \\subset X$ is closed if and only if $\\pi^{-1}(A)$ is closed in $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore $S$ is closed in $X$.\n\n- $S$ is not compact in $X$. Each point of $S$ is isolated in $X$ (because each $t \\in T$ has a small interval in $\\mathbb{R}$ avoiding $\\mathbb{Z}$ and avoiding the other points of $T$, which maps homeomorphically to an open neighborhood of $\\pi(t)$ containing no other points of $S$). Thus $S$ is an infinite discrete subset. An infinite discrete space is not compact (cover by the collection of singleton open sets has no finite subcover). Therefore $S$ is not compact in $X$.\n\nSince $S \\subset N$ and $S$ is closed in $X$ but not compact, no compact subset $K \\subset X$ can contain $N$ (otherwise $S \\subset K$ would be a closed subset of a compact set and hence compact, a contradiction). Therefore no neighborhood $N$ of $p$ is contained in a compact subset, i.e., $p$ does not possess any compact neighborhood. Consequently, $X$ is not locally compact.\n\nWe now assess the options:\n\n- A is false: quotients of locally compact spaces need not be locally compact; indeed, $X$ fails local compactness at $p$.\n\n- B is false: the map $\\pi$ is not open. For example, let $O=(-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})$. Then $\\pi^{-1}(\\pi(O))=O \\cup \\mathbb{Z}$, which is not open in $\\mathbb{R}$, so $\\pi(O)$ is not open in $X$.\n\n- C is false as a reason: $X$ is in fact Hausdorff. Given $y=\\pi(t)$ with $t \\notin \\mathbb{Z}$, by normality of $\\mathbb{R}$ there exist disjoint open sets $U,V \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ with $\\mathbb{Z} \\subset U$, $t \\in V$, and $U \\cap V=\\emptyset$. Then $\\pi(U)$ and $\\pi(V)$ are disjoint open neighborhoods of $p$ and $y$. Distinct non-integer points are separated as in $\\mathbb{R}$. Thus non-Hausdorffness does not occur at $p$.\n\n- D is true by the argument above: $p$ has no compact neighborhood, hence $X$ is not locally compact.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is D.",
