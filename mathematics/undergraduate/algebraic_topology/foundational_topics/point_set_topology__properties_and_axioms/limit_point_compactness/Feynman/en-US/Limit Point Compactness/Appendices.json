This first practice invites you to explore the properties of a familiar shape, the hyperbola, within the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ . By examining an infinite set of points along the hyperbola's unbounded curve, you will develop a strong intuition for how the geometric notion of \"escaping to infinity\" translates into the topological failure of limit point compactness.",

            "problem": "In the context of point-set topology, a topological space $X$ is defined as being **limit point compact** if every infinite subset of $X$ has at least one limit point that is also in $X$.\n\nConsider the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ equipped with its standard topology. Let $S$ be the subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ consisting of all points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation $xy = 1$.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the limit point compactness of the subspace $S$?\n\nA. $S$ is limit point compact because any infinite sequence of points in $S$ is guaranteed to converge to a point within $S$.\n\nB. $S$ is not limit point compact because one can construct an infinite subset of $S$ that has no limit point in $S$.\n\nC. $S$ is limit point compact because it is a closed subset of the complete metric space $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nD. $S$ is not limit point compact because the subspace $S$ is not path-connected.\n\nE. $S$ is limit point compact because the function $f(x, y) = xy - 1$ is a continuous function from $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\\mathbb{R}$.",
            "solution": "We consider the subspace $S=\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}: xy=1\\}$ with the subspace topology from the Euclidean plane. The set $S$ is the zero set of the continuous function $f:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ given by $f(x,y)=xy-1$, so\n$$\nS=f^{-1}(\\{0\\}),\n$$\nand since $\\{0\\}$ is closed in $\\mathbb{R}$ and $f$ is continuous, $S$ is closed in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\n\nHowever, $S$ is unbounded. Indeed, for each $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, the point $(n,1/n)\\in S$, and the $x$-coordinate $n$ can be made arbitrarily large. By the Heine–Borel theorem in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, compactness is equivalent to being closed and bounded, so $S$ is not compact.\n\nIn metric spaces (in particular in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with the Euclidean metric), compactness, sequential compactness, and limit point compactness are equivalent. Therefore, since $S$ is not compact, it is not limit point compact.\n\nEquivalently, we can explicitly construct an infinite subset of $S$ with no limit point in $S$. Let\n$$\nA=\\{(n,1/n): n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}\\subset S.\n$$\nWe claim $A$ has no limit point in $S$. Let $p=(x_{0},y_{0})\\in S$, so $y_{0}=1/x_{0}\\neq 0$.\n\n- If $y_{0}<0$, choose $r=\\frac{|y_{0}|}{2}$. Then any point in the open ball $B(p,r)$ has $y$-coordinate in $(y_{0}-r, y_{0}+r)$, which is contained in $(-\\infty,0)$, while every point of $A$ has positive $y$-coordinate $1/n>0$. Hence $B(p,r)\\cap A=\\varnothing$.\n\n- If $y_{0}>0$, choose $r=\\frac{y_{0}}{2}$. Then any point in $B(p,r)$ has $y$-coordinate in $(\\frac{y_{0}}{2}, \\frac{3y_{0}}{2})$. For all $n>\\frac{2}{y_{0}}$, we have $\\frac{1}{n}<\\frac{y_{0}}{2}$, so $(n,1/n)\\notin B(p,r)$. Thus only finitely many points of $A$ can lie in $B(p,r)$.\n\nIn either case, there exists $r>0$ such that $B(p,r)$ contains at most finitely many points of $A$, so $p$ is not a limit point of $A$. Since $p\\in S$ was arbitrary, $A$ has no limit point in $S$, proving $S$ is not limit point compact.\n\nAssessing the options:\n- A is false: limit point compactness does not assert that any infinite sequence converges; furthermore, many sequences in $S$ diverge.\n- B is true by the explicit construction above.\n- C is false: being closed in a complete metric space implies completeness, not compactness or limit point compactness.\n- D is false in its reasoning: path-connectedness is unrelated to limit point compactness.\n- E is false in its reasoning: continuity of $f$ only implies $S$ is closed, not limit point compact.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.",
