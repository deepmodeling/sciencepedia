            "solution": "We consider $X = \\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0,1]$ with the subspace topology inherited from $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFirst, recall the definition: A topological space is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover. To show that $X$ is not compact, it suffices to produce an explicit open cover of $X$ that admits no finite subcover.\n\nBecause $X$ is countable, enumerate it as $X = \\{q_{n}: n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. For each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, define\n$$\nU_{n} := X \\setminus \\{q_{n}\\}.\n$$\nEach $U_{n}$ is open in the subspace topology on $X$ because $\\{q_{n}\\}$ is closed in $\\mathbb{R}$, hence $X \\cap (\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{q_{n}\\}) = U_{n}$ is open in $X$.\n\nNow verify that $\\{U_{n}\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is an open cover of $X$. For any $x \\in X$, say $x = q_{m}$ for some $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Then $x \\in U_{n}$ for every $n \\neq m$, hence\n$$\nX = \\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} U_{n}.\n$$\nNext, show that no finite subcollection covers $X$.

Therefore, every finite subfamily fails to cover $X$. Consequently, $X$ is not compact.\n\nThis establishes the conclusion stated in option A.\n\nFor completeness, evaluate the other options’ justifications:\n- Option B is false because $X$ is not closed in $[0,1]$ (its closure in $\\mathbb{R}$ is $[0,1]$), so it is not a closed subset of a compact space.\n- Option C is false: boundedness alone does not imply compactness in $\\mathbb{R}$; Heine–Borel requires closed and bounded.\n- Option D has an invalid justification: a subset of a non-compact space can be compact, so non-compactness does not descend to subsets in general.\n- Option E is false: by Heine–Borel, compact subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$ are closed and bounded; while $X$ is bounded, it is not closed in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThus the correct statement and justification are those in option A.",

            "solution": "To determine the correct description of the subset $S = \\{q, r\\}$, we need to analyze two properties based on their definitions in topology: compactness and being a closed set.\n\n**1. Analysis of Compactness**\n\nA subset $S$ of a topological space $(X, \\mathcal{T})$ is defined as **compact** if every open cover of $S$ has a finite subcover. An open cover of $S$ is a collection of open sets from $\\mathcal{T}$ whose union contains $S$.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{C}$ be an arbitrary open cover for $S = \\{q, r\\}$. This means that $\\mathcal{C}$ is a subcollection of $\\mathcal{T}$ such that $S \\subseteq \\bigcup_{U \\in \\mathcal{C}} U$.\n\nTo cover the element $r \\in S$, our open cover $\\mathcal{C}$ must contain at least one open set $U \\in \\mathcal{T}$ such that $r \\in U$. Let's examine the open sets in $\\mathcal{T} = \\{\\emptyset, \\{p\\}, \\{p, q\\}, X\\}$.\n- $\\emptyset$ contains no elements.\n- $\\{p\\}$ does not contain $r$.\n- $\\{p, q\\}$ does not contain $r$.\n- $X = \\{p, q, r, s\\}$ is the only open set in $\\mathcal{T}$ that contains the element $r$.\n\nTherefore, any open cover $\\mathcal{C}$ for the set $S = \\{q, r\\}$ must necessarily include the set $X$.\n\nIf $X$ is an element of the open cover $\\mathcal{C}$, then the single-element subcollection $\\{X\\}$ is itself a cover for $S$ (in fact, it covers all of $X$). Since $\\{X\\}$ is a finite collection (it has one element), we have found a finite subcover for our arbitrary open cover $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\nBecause every open cover of $S$ must contain $X$, and $\\{X\\}$ is always a valid finite subcover, we conclude that the subset $S$ is **compact**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the \"Closed\" Property**\n\nA subset $S$ of a topological space $(X, \\mathcal{T})$ is defined as **closed** if its complement, $X \\setminus S$, is an open set (i.e., the complement is an element of the topology $\\mathcal{T}$).\n\nLet's find the complement of $S = \\{q, r\\}$ in the space $X = \\{p, q, r, s\\}$.\nThe complement is denoted $S^c$.\n$$ S^c = X \\setminus S = \\{p, q, r, s\\} \\setminus \\{q, r\\} = \\{p, s\\} $$\nNow, we must check if this complement, $\\{p, s\\}$, is an open set. An open set must be an element of the given topology $\\mathcal{T}$.\nOur topology is $\\mathcal{T} = \\{\\emptyset, \\{p\\}, \\{p, q\\}, X\\}$.\nThe set $\\{p, s\\}$ is not in this collection.\nTherefore, the complement of $S$ is not an open set. By definition, this means that the subset $S$ is **not closed**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have determined that the subset $S$ is compact, but it is not closed. Matching this conclusion with the given options:\n\n- A. $S$ is compact and closed. (Incorrect)\n- B. $S$ is compact, but not closed. (Correct)\n- C. $S$ is closed, but not compact. (Incorrect)\n- D. $S$ is neither compact nor closed. (Incorrect)\n- E. The properties cannot be determined. (Incorrect)\n\nThus, the correct statement is that $S$ is compact, but not closed. This is a common situation in topological spaces that are not Hausdorff. In a Hausdorff space, every compact subset is necessarily closed. The space $(X, \\mathcal{T})$ is not Hausdorff, as for the distinct points $r$ and $s$, there are no disjoint open sets containing them.",
