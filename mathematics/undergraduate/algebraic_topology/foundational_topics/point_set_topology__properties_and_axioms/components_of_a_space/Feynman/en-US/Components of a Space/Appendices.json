We will use a continuous map from our space of interest to a simpler, known disconnected space. By analyzing the image of this map, we can effectively partition the original space and prove that no path can cross between partitions, thus establishing the path components. ",

            "solution": "We work in $M_{2}(\\mathbb{R})$ with the Euclidean topology on entries. For $a,b>0$, define $D(a,b)=\\mathrm{diag}(a,b)$ and\n$$\nX(a,b)=\\{A\\in M_{2}(\\mathbb{R}) : A^{2}=D(a,b)\\}.\n$$\nFirst observe that for any $A\\in X(a,b)$, we have $A^{2}=D(a,b)$, hence\n$$\nD(a,b)\\,A=(A^{2})A=A(A^{2})=A\\,D(a,b),\n$$\nso every $A\\in X(a,b)$ commutes with $D(a,b)$.\n\n1) Case $a\\neq b$ (apply to $a=9$, $b=25$). The commutant of $D(a,b)$ with $a\\neq b$ equals the set of diagonal matrices. Indeed, if $X=\\begin{pmatrix}x_{11}&x_{12}\\\\ x_{21}&x_{22}\\end{pmatrix}$ and $X D(a,b)=D(a,b) X$, then\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na x_{11} & b x_{12} \\\\\na x_{21} & b x_{22}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na x_{11} & a x_{12} \\\\\nb x_{21} & b x_{22}\n\\end{pmatrix},\n$$\nso $(b-a)x_{12}=0$ and $(a-b)x_{21}=0$, which implies $x_{12}=x_{21}=0$, while $x_{11},x_{22}$ are arbitrary. Therefore every $A\\in X(a,b)$ is diagonal:\n$$\nA=\\mathrm{diag}(x,y),\\quad A^{2}=D(a,b)\\iff x^{2}=a,\\;y^{2}=b.\n$$\nThus $X(a,b)=\\{\\mathrm{diag}(\\pm\\sqrt{a},\\pm\\sqrt{b})\\}$ consists of four points. Any path $A(t)$ in $X(a,b)$ must satisfy $A(t)$ commuting with $D(a,b)$ for all $t$, hence remain diagonal, and $x(t),y(t)$ must stay in the discrete sets $\\{\\pm\\sqrt{a}\\}$ and $\\{\\pm\\sqrt{b}\\}$, respectively. Therefore each point is isolated, and the number of path components is $4$. In particular, for $X(9,25)$ we have $N_{1}=4$.\n\n2) Case $a=b=16$ (so $D(16,16)=16I$). Here $A^{2}=16I$. Set $B=\\frac{1}{4}A$. Then\n$$\nB^{2}=I.\n$$\nThus $B$ is a real involution. Its minimal polynomial divides $x^{2}-1=(x-1)(x+1)$, which has distinct roots, so $B$ is diagonalizable over $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore $B$ is similar to one of $\\mathrm{diag}(1,1)=I$, $\\mathrm{diag}(-1,-1)=-I$, or $\\mathrm{diag}(1,-1)=J$. Correspondingly, $A=4B$ equals $4I$, $-4I$, or is similar to $4J$. Hence\n$$\nX(16,16)=\\{4I\\}\\;\\cup\\;\\{-4I\\}\\;\\cup\\;\\{\\,P\\,(4J)\\,P^{-1}:P\\in \\mathrm{GL}_{2}(\\mathbb{R})\\,\\}.\n$$\nWe analyze path components:\n- The set $\\mathcal{O}=\\{P\\,(4J)\\,P^{-1}:P\\in \\mathrm{GL}_{2}(\\mathbb{R})\\}$ is a single path component. Let $\\mathrm{GL}_{2}^{+}(\\mathbb{R})=\\{P:\\det P>0\\}$, which is connected. The map $P\\mapsto P(4J)P^{-1}$ from $\\mathrm{GL}_{2}^{+}(\\mathbb{R})$ to $M_{2}(\\mathbb{R})$ is continuous, so its image is connected. We show this image equals $\\mathcal{O}$. If $Q\\in \\mathrm{GL}_{2}(\\mathbb{R})$ has $\\det Q<0$, choose $S$ in the centralizer of $J$ with $\\det S<0$, for example $S=J=\\mathrm{diag}(1,-1)$. Then $SJS^{-1}=J$, and with $P=QS$ we have $\\det P>0$ and\n$$\nQ\\,(4J)\\,Q^{-1}=P\\,S^{-1}(4J)S\\,P^{-1}=P\\,(4J)\\,P^{-1}.\n$$\nThus $\\mathcal{O}$ is the image of $\\mathrm{GL}_{2}^{+}(\\mathbb{R})$ and is connected.\n- The points $4I$ and $-4I$ are isolated in $X(16,16)$. Indeed, if $A^{2}=16I$ and $\\det A=16$, then the eigenvalues (counted with multiplicity) are either both $4$ or both $-4$. If both are $4$, then the characteristic polynomial is $(x-4)^{2}$ and, since $B=\\frac{1}{4}A$ is diagonalizable with minimal polynomial dividing $x-1$, we must have $A=4I$. Similarly, if both are $-4$, then $A=-4I$. Hence the subset $\\{A\\in X(16,16):\\det A=16\\}$ equals $\\{4I,-4I\\}$, a discrete two-point set, so neither $4I$ nor $-4I$ can be path-connected to any other point. Also, $\\det$ is continuous and takes only the values $16$ and $-16$ on $X(16,16)$, so the connected component containing any matrix with mixed eigenvalues (hence determinant $-16$) cannot contain $4I$ or $-4I$.\n\nTherefore, $X(16,16)$ has exactly three path components: one consisting of all matrices similar to $4J$, and two singleton components $\\{4I\\}$ and $\\{-4I\\}$. Hence $N_{2}=3$.\n\nCollecting results, we obtain $(N_{1},N_{2})=(4,3)$.",
