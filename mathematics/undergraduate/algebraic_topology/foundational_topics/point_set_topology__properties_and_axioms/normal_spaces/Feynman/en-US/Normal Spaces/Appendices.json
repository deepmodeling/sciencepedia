            "solution": "We analyze each statement about the Sorgenfrey line $\\mathbb{R}_{l}$, whose basis consists of all half-open intervals $[a,b)$ with $ab$.\n\nFirst, recall the definitions we will use:\n- Compactness: every open cover has a finite subcover.\n- Metrizability: the topology arises from some metric; in metric spaces, separability implies second countability.\n- Normality: any two disjoint closed sets can be separated by disjoint open neighborhoods.\n\nStatement A. Consider the open cover $\\mathcal{U}=\\{[n, n+1) \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\} \\cup \\{(-n, -n+1) \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. No, consider the open cover $\\mathcal{U} = \\{[x, x+1) \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$. It covers $\\mathbb{R}$ because for any $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $t \\in [t, t+1)$. Suppose a finite subcollection $\\{[x_i, x_i+1)\\}_{i=1}^n$ covers $\\mathbb{R}$. Let $m = \\min\\{x_1, \\dots, x_n\\}$. Then any point $t  m$ is not in $\\bigcup_{i=1}^n [x_i, x_i+1)$, which is a contradiction. Hence, no finite subcover exists, so $\\mathbb{R}_l$ is not compact. Therefore A is false.\n\nStatement B. A space is metrizable only if it is second-countable (i.e., has a countable basis). We show $\\mathbb{R}_l$ is not second-countable. Assume, for contradiction, that $\\mathcal{B}$ is a countable basis for $\\mathbb{R}_l$. For any real number $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the set $[x, x+1)$ is open in $\\mathbb{R}_l$. Thus, for each $x$, there must exist a basis element $B_x \\in \\mathcal{B}$ such that $x \\in B_x \\subseteq [x, x+1)$. Since $x$ is the smallest element of $[x, x+1)$, it must also be the smallest element of $B_x$. So, $B_x$ must be of the form $[x, y)$ for some $y$. This implies that for any two distinct real numbers $x \\ne z$, the corresponding basis elements $B_x$ and $B_z$ must be distinct (as their minimal elements are $x$ and $z$, respectively). This defines an injective map from the uncountable set $\\mathbb{R}$ into the countable set $\\mathcal{B}$, which is impossible. Therefore, $\\mathbb{R}_l$ is not second-countable and thus cannot be metrizable. Hence B is false.\n\nStatement C. Let $I=\\mathbb{R}\\setminus \\mathbb{Q}$ be the set of irrationals. For any rational number $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ and any basic neighborhood $[q, q+\\epsilon)$ with $\\epsilon > 0$, this interval contains irrational numbers. This means every rational number is a limit point of the set of irrationals. Thus, the closure of $I$ contains all of $\\mathbb{Q}$, so $\\overline{I}=\\mathbb{R}$. Since $I \\ne \\mathbb{R}$, the set $I$ is not closed. Hence C is false.\n\nStatement D. We prove that $\\mathbb{R}_{l}$ is normal. In fact, it is perfectly normal, which is a stronger condition. Let $F$ and $G$ be disjoint closed subsets of $\\mathbb{R}_{l}$. For each $x \\in F$, since $G$ is closed and $x \\notin G$, there is a basic open set $[x, y_x)$ that does not intersect $G$. Similarly, for each $y \\in G$, there is an open set $[y, z_y)$ that does not intersect $F$. Let $U = \\bigcup_{x \\in F} [x, y_x)$ and $V = \\bigcup_{y \\in G} [y, z_y)$. Then $U$ and $V$ are open sets containing $F$ and $G$, respectively. One can show that these sets can be chosen so they are disjoint. A full proof that $\\mathbb{R}_l$ is normal is non-trivial, but it is a standard result in topology. Therefore D is true.\n\nStatement E. The product $\\mathbb{R}_{l}\\times \\mathbb{R}_{l}$ (the Sorgenfrey plane) is not normal. A classical construction shows this: let $A = \\{(q, -q) \\mid q \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\}$ (points on the anti-diagonal with rational coordinates) and $B = \\{(r, -r) \\mid r \\in \\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\mathbb{Q}\\}$ (points with irrational coordinates). Both $A$ and $B$ are closed sets in the Sorgenfrey plane, and they are disjoint. It is a famous result that these two sets cannot be separated by disjoint open sets in the Sorgenfrey plane. Hence E is false.\n\nCollecting the conclusions: A is false, B is false, C is false, D is true, E is false. Therefore, the correct statement is D.",

The Sorgenfrey line, denoted $\\mathbb{R}_l$, is the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ equipped with the lower-limit topology, for which the basis consists of all half-open intervals of the form $[a, b)$ where $a  b$. The **Sorgenfrey plane** is the product space $\\mathbb{R}_l^2 = \\mathbb{R}_l \\times \\mathbb{R}_l$.

It can be shown that $L$ is a closed subspace of the Sorgenfrey plane and that the subspace topology on $L$ is the discrete topology (i.e., every subset of $L$ is open in $L$).\n\nNow, partition the points on the anti-diagonal $L$ into two sets:\n1.

The plane is normal if and only if these (and all other pairs of disjoint closed sets) can be separated by disjoint open sets.\n\nA. The premise of this statement is factually incorrect. The Sorgenfrey line $\\mathbb{R}_l$ is a well-known example of a space that is Lindelöf (i.e., every open cover has a countable subcover). While the product of two Lindelöf spaces is not necessarily Lindelöf (and indeed $\\mathbb{R}_l^2$ is not), the reasoning presented in the option starts from a false statement, so it cannot be the correct explanation.\n\nB. This statement is false. The anti-diagonal $L$ is a closed set in the Sorgenfrey plane. Because $L$ has the discrete topology as a subspace, any of its subsets (including $A$ and $B$) are closed in $L$. Since $L$ itself is closed in $\\mathbb{R}_l^2$, it follows that $A$ and $B$ are closed sets in $\\mathbb{R}_l^2$.\n\nC. This statement contains two errors. First, the Sorgenfrey line $\\mathbb{R}_l$ is a normal space. Second, the general claim that the product of two normal spaces is always normal is false—the Sorgenfrey plane itself is the primary counterexample to this claim.\n\nD.

An open set $U$ containing $A$ must, for each point $(q, -q) \\in A$, contain a basic open rectangle $[q, q+\\epsilon_q) \\times [-q, -q+\\delta_q)$. Due to the density of irrational numbers, any such open set $U$ covering all of $A$ will inevitably \"intrude\" upon points close to the irrational anti-diagonal points in $B$. A formal proof using Baire Category Theorem shows that for any such open sets $U \\supset A$ and $V \\supset B$, their intersection $U \\cap V$ is non-empty. This demonstrates that $\\mathbb{R}_l^2$ is not normal. This reasoning is correct.\n\nE. This statement is false. The Sorgenfrey line $\\mathbb{R}_l$ is a Hausdorff space.

            "problem": "This problem concerns the explicit construction of a function extension as given by the canonical proof of the Tietze Extension Theorem.\n\n**Background:**\nLet $X$ be a normal topological space and $A \\subseteq X$ a closed subspace. The Tietze Extension Theorem states that any continuous function $f: A \\to [a, b]$ can be extended to a continuous function $F: X \\to [a,b]$ such that $F(x) = f(x)$ for all $x \\in A$.\n\nA canonical construction of this extension $F$ proceeds as follows:\n1.  First, one defines a linear homeomorphism $T: [a,b] \\to [-1,1]$ by $T(y) = 2\\frac{y-a}{b-a} - 1$. The function $\\tilde{f} = T \\circ f$ maps $A$ to $[-1,1]$.\n2.  One then constructs an extension $\\tilde{F}: X \\to [-1,1]$ for $\\tilde{f}$. The final extension for $f$ is given by $F = T^{-1} \\circ \\tilde{F}$.\n3.  The extension $\\tilde{F}$ is built as a uniformly convergent series $\\tilde{F}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} h_k(x)$. The functions $h_k(x)$ are generated recursively.\n4.
