This space is endowed with the product topology, which is generated by basis elements of the form $\\prod_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} U_n$, where each $U_n$ is an open set in $\\mathbb{R}$ and $U_n = \\mathbb{R}$ for all but a finite number of indices $n$.\n\nTychonoff's theorem is a fundamental result in topology which states: \"An arbitrary product of compact topological spaces is compact with respect to the product topology.\"\n\nA student attempts to use Tychonoff's theorem to argue that the space $X = \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{N}}$ is compact.

Tychonoff's theorem states that an arbitrary product $\\prod_{i \\in I} X_{i}$ is compact (in the product topology) provided that each factor space $X_{i}$ is compact.\n\nTo apply Tychonoff's theorem to $X = \\prod_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\mathbb{R}$, we would need each factor $\\mathbb{R}$ (with its standard topology) to be compact. However, $\\mathbb{R}$ is not compact. One explicit proof uses an open cover with no finite subcover: consider the collection $\\{U_{n}\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ where $U_{n} = (-n, n)$. Then $\\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} U_{n} = \\mathbb{R}$, so this is an open cover.

Consequently, Tychonoff's theorem cannot be directly applied to deduce compactness of $X$.\n\nWe briefly address the other options:\n- The index set being infinite (option B) is not an obstruction; Tychonoff's theorem applies to arbitrary (possibly infinite) products.\n- $\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{N}}$ is Hausdorff because a product of Hausdorff spaces is Hausdorff; thus option C is false and not a reason.\n- The statement about the box topology (option D) is irrelevant because $X$ uses the product topology, which is exactly the topology in Tychonoff's theorem.\n- The index set need not be a topological space (option E); it is merely a set indexing the product.\n\nHence the precise reason is that the factor spaces in the product are not compact.",
