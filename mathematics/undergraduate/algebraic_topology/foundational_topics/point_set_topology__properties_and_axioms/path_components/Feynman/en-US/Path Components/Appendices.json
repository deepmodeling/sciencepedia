By considering a space constructed from simple, familiar shapes—circles and a line segment—you will practice using the theorem that a union of path-connected sets is itself path-connected if they share at least one common point. This problem builds your intuition for how to \"glue\" spaces together to form a single, continuous whole .",

This segment is described by the set of points $\\{(x, 0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid 1 \\le x \\le 2\\}$.\n\nThe topological space in question is the union of these three sets, $S = S_1 \\cup S_2 \\cup L$.\n\nDetermine the number of path components of the space $S$.\n\n",
            "solution": "We recall that a path in a topological space $X$ is a continuous map $\\gamma:[0,1]\\to X$, and $X$ is path connected if for any $x,y\\in X$ there exists such a $\\gamma$ with $\\gamma(0)=x$ and $\\gamma(1)=y$. Path components are the maximal path connected subsets, so showing $S$ is path connected implies that $S$ has exactly one path component.\n\nFirst, each of the pieces $S_{1}$, $S_{2}$, and $L$ is path connected:\n- $S_{1}=\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}:x^{2}+y^{2}=1\\}$ is path connected via the standard angular parametrization. Concretely, if $p=(\\cos\\theta,\\sin\\theta)\\in S_{1}$ with $\\theta\\in[0,2\\pi)$, then\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\theta}(t)=(\\cos((1-t)\\theta),\\sin((1-t)\\theta)),\\quad t\\in[0,1],\n$$\nis a continuous path in $S_{1}$ from $p$ to $(1,0)$.\n- $S_{2}=\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}:x^{2}+y^{2}=4\\}$ is path connected similarly.

In particular,\n$$\n\\lambda(t)=(1+t,0),\\quad t\\in[0,1],\n$$\nis a continuous path in $L$ from $(1,0)$ to $(2,0)$.\n\nSecond, we use the standard theorem: if $A$ and $B$ are path connected and $A\\cap B\\neq\\emptyset$, then $A\\cup B$ is path connected. Applying this twice:\n- $S_{1}\\cap L=\\{(1,0)\\}\\neq\\emptyset$, so $S_{1}\\cup L$ is path connected.\n- $(S_{1}\\cup L)\\cap S_{2}=L\\cap S_{2}=\\{(2,0)\\}\\neq\\emptyset$, so $(S_{1}\\cup L)\\cup S_{2}=S$ is path connected.\n\nEquivalently, we can construct explicit paths between arbitrary points using concatenation.

The set of rational numbers, denoted by $\\mathbb{Q}$, is considered as a topological subspace of $\\mathbb{R}$. This means that a set $V \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}$ is open in $\\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if $V = U \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$ for some open set $U$ in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nRecall that a *path* between two points $x$ and $y$ in a topological space $X$ is a continuous function $f: [0, 1] \\to X$ such that $f(0) = x$ and $f(1) = y$.

There are two path components: the set of non-negative rationals $\\mathbb{Q}_{\\geq 0}$ and the set of negative rationals $\\mathbb{Q}_{<0}$.\nD. The path components are uncountable in number.\nE. The space $\\mathbb{Q}$ has no path components.\n\n",
            "solution": "We aim to determine the path components of $\\mathbb{Q}$ with the subspace topology from $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFirst, recall the general topological principle: if $f:[0,1]\\to X$ is continuous and $[0,1]$ is connected, then $f([0,1])$ is a connected subset of $X$. Therefore, any path in $\\mathbb{Q}$ has a connected image in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nNext, we characterize connected subsets of $\\mathbb{Q}$. Let $C\\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}$ be connected. Suppose, for contradiction, that $C$ contains two distinct points $p,q\\in \\mathbb{Q}$ with $p<q$. By the density of the irrationals in $\\mathbb{R}$, there exists an irrational number $r$ with $p<r<q$. Consider the open sets $U=(-\\infty,r)$ and $V=(r,\\infty)$ in $\\mathbb{R}$. Then $U\\cap \\mathbb{Q}$ and $V\\cap \\mathbb{Q}$ are disjoint open sets in the subspace $\\mathbb{Q}$, and\n$$\nC \\subseteq (U\\cap \\mathbb{Q}) \\cup (V\\cap \\mathbb{Q}), \\quad C\\cap (U\\cap \\mathbb{Q}) \\neq \\varnothing, \\quad C\\cap (V\\cap \\mathbb{Q}) \\neq \\varnothing,\n$$\nsince $p\\in U\\cap \\mathbb{Q}$ and $q\\in V\\cap \\mathbb{Q}$. This expresses $C$ as a union of two disjoint nonempty sets open in the subspace topology on $C$, contradicting the connectedness of $C$. Hence no connected subset of $\\mathbb{Q}$ can contain two distinct points, so every connected subset of $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a singleton.\n\nNow consider any continuous path $f:[0,1]\\to \\mathbb{Q}$. Its image $f([0,1])$ must be connected in $\\mathbb{Q}$, hence, by the previous paragraph, must be a singleton. Therefore, if $f(0)=x$ and $f(1)=y$ with $x,y\\in \\mathbb{Q}$, we must have $x=y$. It follows that no two distinct rationals can be joined by a path in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nConsequently, the path component of any $q\\in \\mathbb{Q}$ is the singleton $\\{q\\}$. This matches option A. For completeness: singletons are path connected via the constant path, and path components are maximal path connected subsets, so the path components are exactly the singletons.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.",

First, connect $(a_{0},b_{0},c_{0})$ to $(a_{0},0,c_{1})$ with $c_{1}<0$ by keeping $a$ fixed and moving $b$ to $0$ while decreasing $c$.

For $b_{0}=0$, we have $D(t)=-4a_{0}(c_{0}-\\lambda t)$, and since $a_{0}>0$ and $c_{0}<0$ (because $D_{0}>0$ with $b_{0}=0$), $c(t)=c_{0}-\\lambda t<0$ for all $t\\in[0,1]$, hence $D(t)>0$. In either case $D(t)>0$ along the path, and $c(1)=c_{0}-\\lambda<-1<0$ by the choice of $\\lambda$.\n\nSecond, connect $(a_{0},0,c_{1})$ to $(a_{0},0,-1)$ by the linear path\n$$\na(s)=a_{0},\\quad b(s)=0,\\quad c(s)=(1-s)c_{1}-s,\\quad s\\in[0,1].\n$$\nHere $c(s)<0$ for all $s$ since $c_{1}<-1$, and therefore $D(s)=b(s)^{2}-4a(s)c(s)=-4a_{0}c(s)>0$.\n\nThird, connect $(a_{0},0,-1)$ to $(1,0,-1)$ by\n$$\na(u)=(1-u)a_{0}+u,\\quad b(u)=0,\\quad c(u)=-1,\\quad u\\in[0,1].\n$$\nThen $a(u)>0$ and $D(u)=b(u)^{2}-4a(u)c(u)=4a(u)>0$. Concatenating these paths shows $(a_{0},b_{0},c_{0})$ is path-connected to $(1,0,-1)$ within $S_{+}$.

Keep $a$ fixed, move $b$ to $0$ and increase $c$ to a positive value.

For $b_{0}=0$, $D(t)=-4a_{0}(c_{0}+\\lambda t)>0$ because $a_{0}<0$ and $c(t)>0$ for all $t$. Moreover, $c(1)=c_{0}+\\lambda>1$. Next, with $a$ fixed and $b=0$, connect $(a_{0},0,c_{1})$ to $(a_{0},0,1)$ linearly in $c$, keeping $c>0$ so that $D=-4a_{0}c>0$. Finally, with $b=0$ and $c=1$, connect $a_{0}$ to $-1$ linearly; along this path $D=-4a\\cdot 1>0$ since $a<0$. Concatenation yields a path in $S_{-}$ from $(a_{0},b_{0},c_{0})$ to $(-1,0,1)$, so $S_{-}$ is path-connected.\n\nTherefore $S$ has exactly two path components, namely $S_{+}$ and $S_{-}$, distinguished by the sign of $a$.",
