            "introduction": "The concepts of interior, closure, and boundary are not intrinsic to a set alone; they are fundamentally defined by the topological space in which the set resides. This exercise challenges our geometric intuition, which is often shaped by the standard Euclidean topology, by exploring these concepts in the cofinite topology on the set of natural numbers, $\\mathbb{N}$. By working through this problem, you will see how a familiar set can have surprisingly different topological properties when the definition of an \"open set\" is altered. ",
