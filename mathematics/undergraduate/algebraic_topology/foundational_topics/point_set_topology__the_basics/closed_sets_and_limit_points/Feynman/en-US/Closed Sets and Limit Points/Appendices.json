            "problem": "In the context of the standard Euclidean topology on $\\mathbb{R}^2$, consider the set $S$ defined as the collection of all points $(x,y)$ where at least one of the coordinates, $x$ or $y$, is a rational number. That is, $S = \\{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\text{ or } y \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\}$.\n\nEvaluate the following statements regarding the set $S$:\n\nI. $S$ is an open set.\nII. $S$ is a closed set.\nIII.

II and III only\n\nC. IV only\n\nD. I and IV only\n\nE. None of the statements are true.",
            "solution": "Let $S=\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid x\\in \\mathbb{Q} \\text{ or } y\\in \\mathbb{Q}\\}$ in the Euclidean topology.\n\nTo test whether $S$ is open, take any $(a,b)\\in S$. Without loss of generality, suppose $a\\in \\mathbb{Q}$ (the case $b\\in \\mathbb{Q}$ is analogous). Fix any $r>0$. Since $\\mathbb{R}\\setminus \\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$, there exist $u,v\\in \\mathbb{R}\\setminus \\mathbb{Q}$ with $|u-a|<\\frac{r}{2}$ and $|v-b|<\\frac{r}{2}$. Then the point $(u,v)$ satisfies\n$$\n\\sqrt{(u-a)^{2}+(v-b)^{2}} \\le |u-a|+|v-b|<r,\n$$\nso $(u,v)\\in B_{r}(a,b)$, and since both $u$ and $v$ are irrational, $(u,v)\\notin S$. Therefore no open ball around $(a,b)$ is contained in $S$, so $S$ is not open. Thus statement I is false.\n\nTo test whether $S$ is closed, consider its complement $S^{c}=\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid x\\notin \\mathbb{Q} \\text{ and } y\\notin \\mathbb{Q}\\}$. Take any $(\\alpha,\\beta)\\in S^{c}$ and any $r>0$. Since $\\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$, there exists $q\\in \\mathbb{Q}$ with $|q-\\alpha|<\\frac{r}{2}$. Then $(q,\\beta)\\in S$ and\n$$\n\\sqrt{(q-\\alpha)^{2}+(\\beta-\\beta)^{2}}=|q-\\alpha|<r,\n$$\nso $B_{r}(\\alpha,\\beta)$ meets $S$. Hence no open ball around $(\\alpha,\\beta)$ is contained in $S^{c}$, so $S^{c}$ is not open. Therefore $S$ is not closed, and statement II is false.\n\nFor limit points, recall that a point $p\\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is a limit point of $S$ if every open ball around $p$ contains a point of $S$ distinct from $p$. Let $(x_{0},y_{0})\\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ be arbitrary and let $r>0$. By density of $\\mathbb{Q}$ in $\\mathbb{R}$, there exists $q\\in \\mathbb{Q}$ with $0<|q-x_{0}|<\\frac{r}{2}$. Then $(q,y_{0})\\in S$, $(q,y_{0})\\neq (x_{0},y_{0})$, and\n$$\n\\sqrt{(q-x_{0})^{2}+(y_{0}-y_{0})^{2}}=|q-x_{0}|<r,\n$$\nso $(q,y_{0})\\in B_{r}(x_{0},y_{0})$. Since $(x_{0},y_{0})$ and $r>0$ were arbitrary, every point of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is a limit point of $S$. Thus the set of all limit points of $S$ equals $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Therefore statement IV is true, and statement III, which claims the limit points equal $S$, is false.\n\nConsequently, only statement IV is true.",

Instead of analyzing the Cantor set directly, you will explore the set of limit points of a related, countable set—the midpoints of the intervals removed during its construction. This problem provides a concrete look at how a simple iterative process can generate a set of limit points with a complex, fractal structure, highlighting the deep connection between geometric construction and topological properties .",

            "problem": "The standard middle-thirds Cantor set is a subset of the real line constructed by an iterative process. One begins with the closed interval $[0, 1]$. In the first step, the open middle third $(1/3, 2/3)$ is removed. In the second step, the open middle thirds of the two remaining shorter intervals are removed, namely $(1/9, 2/9)$ and $(7/9, 8/9)$.

            "solution": "Let $C \\subset [0,1]$ be the Cantor set. At step $k \\ge 1$, the $2^{k-1}$ removed open intervals are the middle thirds of the $2^{k-1}$ closed intervals that remained after step $k-1$. Hence, the midpoints of the removed intervals at step $k$ are exactly the centers of the remaining intervals at step $k-1$.\n\nDescribe $M$ (the set of all such midpoints) in base $3$. For each $n \\ge 1$ and each choice of digits $a_{1},\\dots,a_{n-1} \\in \\{0,2\\}$, the center of a remaining interval at step $n-1$ has the form\n$$\nm=\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} a_{j} 3^{-j}+\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 3^{-(n-1)}.\n$$\nUsing the identity\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 3^{-(n-1)}=\\sum_{m=n}^{\\infty} 3^{-m},\n$$\nwe obtain the base-$3$ expansion\n$$\nm=\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} a_{j} 3^{-j}+\\sum_{m=n}^{\\infty} 1\\cdot 3^{-m},\n$$\nthat is, a finite prefix of digits from $\\{0,2\\}$ followed by an infinite tail of $1$'s. Conversely, every element of $M$ has such a base-$3$ expansion. Thus\n$$\nM=\\left\\{\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} a_{j} 3^{-j}+\\sum_{m=n}^{\\infty} 1\\cdot 3^{-m} \\,:\\, n\\ge 1,\\ a_{j}\\in\\{0,2\\}\\right\\}.\n$$\n\nWe determine the set of limit points $M'$. Recall: $x$ is a limit point of $M$ if every neighborhood of $x$ contains a point of $M$ distinct from $x$.\n\nFirst, show $C \\subset M'$. Let $c \\in C$, so $c=\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} b_{j} 3^{-j}$ with $b_{j}\\in\\{0,2\\}$ for all $j$. For each $n\\ge 1$, define\n$$\nx_{n}=\\sum_{j=1}^{n} b_{j} 3^{-j}+\\sum_{m=n+1}^{\\infty} 1\\cdot 3^{-m} \\in M.\n$$\nThen\n$$\n0 \\le c-x_{n}=\\sum_{j=n+1}^{\\infty} (b_{j}-1) 3^{-j} \\le \\sum_{j=n+1}^{\\infty} 1\\cdot 3^{-j}=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 3^{-n} \\to 0,\n$$\nso $x_{n} \\to c$. Therefore every $c \\in C$ is a limit point of $M$, hence $C \\subset M'$.\n\nNext, show $M' \\subset C$. Let $x \\notin C$. Then, by construction of the Cantor set, $x$ lies in the interior of some open middle-third interval removed at some finite step. Call that interval $(\\alpha,\\beta)$ and its midpoint $m^{*}=(\\alpha+\\beta)/2$. No later steps place removed intervals inside $(\\alpha,\\beta)$, so $M \\cap (\\alpha,\\beta)=\\{m^{*}\\}$. If $x \\neq m^{*}$, choose $r>0$ so that $(x-r,x+r)\\subset (\\alpha,\\beta)$ and $m^{*}\\notin (x-r,x+r)$; then $(x-r,x+r)\\cap M=\\varnothing$, so $x$ is not a limit point. If $x=m^{*}$, choose $r>0$ with $(m^{*}-r,m^{*}+r)\\subset (\\alpha,\\beta)$; then $(m^{*}-r,m^{*}+r)\\cap (M\\setminus\\{m^{*}\\})=\\varnothing$, so $m^{*}$ is not a limit point. Therefore no point in $[0,1]\\setminus C$ is a limit point of $M$. Points outside $[0,1]$ also cannot be limit points since $M \\subset [0,1]$ and there is positive distance to $[0,1]$.\n\nCombining both directions yields $M'=C$. In words, the set of all limit points of $M$ is exactly the Cantor set, i.e., the set of numbers in $[0,1]$ whose base-$3$ expansion uses only digits $0$ and $2$. This corresponds to option A.",
