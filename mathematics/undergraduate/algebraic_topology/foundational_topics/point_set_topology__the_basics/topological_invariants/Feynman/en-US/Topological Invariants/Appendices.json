            "introduction": "The Euler characteristic is one of the most foundational topological invariants, offering a powerful way to classify surfaces and shapes. Defined for polyhedra by the simple formula $\\chi = V - E + F$, it captures a deep property of a shape that remains constant even if the shape is stretched or bent. This first practice invites you to compute the Euler characteristic of a composite object, building your intuition for how this invariant behaves when simple components are combined to form a more complex structure . Understanding this principle is the first step toward using invariants to analyze and distinguish topological spaces.",

            "problem": "An artist designs a modular building block, which we will call a \"stellated unit.\" A stellated unit is created by starting with a solid cube and then attaching a regular square pyramid to each of the cube's six faces. The square base of each pyramid perfectly coincides with the face of the cube to which it is attached.\n\nThe artist then constructs a final sculpture by taking two identical stellated units and joining them together. The two units are attached by identifying a single vertex from the first unit with a single vertex from the second unit. The two units share exactly one point—this common vertex.\n\nThe Euler characteristic, denoted by $\\chi$, of a polyhedral complex is given by the formula $\\chi = V - E + F$, where $V$ is the total number of vertices, $E$ is the total number of edges, and $F$ is the total number of faces in the complex.\n\nCalculate the Euler characteristic, $\\chi$, of the final composite sculpture.",
            "solution": "Let $S$ be one stellated unit. Begin with a cube whose surface has $V=8$, $E=12$, and $F=6$, hence\n$$\n\\chi_{\\text{cube}}=V-E+F=8-12+6=2.\n$$\nAttaching a square pyramid to one face replaces that single square face by four triangular faces meeting at a new apex. Combinatorially, this operation adds one new vertex (the apex), adds four new edges (from the apex to the four vertices of the face), and replaces one face by four faces, i.e., $\\Delta V=+1$, $\\Delta E=+4$, $\\Delta F=+3$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\Delta\\chi=\\Delta V-\\Delta E+\\Delta F=1-4+3=0.\n$$\nPerforming this operation on each of the six faces preserves the Euler characteristic, so\n$$\n\\chi(S)=2.\n$$\nNow form the final sculpture $T$ by gluing two copies $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ at exactly one common vertex. By the inclusion–exclusion property for Euler characteristic of polyhedral complexes,\n$$\n\\chi(T)=\\chi(S_{1})+\\chi(S_{2})-\\chi(S_{1}\\cap S_{2}).\n$$\nHere $S_{1}\\cap S_{2}$ is a single vertex (a point), which has Euler characteristic $1$. Since $\\chi(S_{1})=\\chi(S_{2})=2$, we obtain\n$$\n\\chi(T)=2+2-1=3.\n$$\nEquivalently, if $V_{i},E_{i},F_{i}$ denote the counts for $S_{i}$, then gluing at one vertex identifies one pair of vertices and leaves edges and faces additive, giving\n$$\n\\chi(T)=(V_{1}+V_{2}-1)-(E_{1}+E_{2})+(F_{1}+F_{2})=(V_{1}-E_{1}+F_{1})+(V_{2}-E_{2}+F_{2})-1=2+2-1=3.\n$$\nThus the Euler characteristic of the composite sculpture is $3$.",

            "introduction": "After calculating an invariant for a given space, a natural question arises: what does this number truly tell us about the space's identity? A primary goal in topology is to determine if two spaces are homeomorphic, meaning one can be deformed into the other. Topological invariants are our main tools for this task. This exercise  explores the power and limitations of this approach by presenting two distinct spaces that share the same Euler characteristic. This will highlight a crucial concept: while invariants can definitively prove that two spaces are *different*, they cannot always prove that they are the *same*, motivating the need for a richer set of distinguishing properties.",

            "introduction": "As we've seen, simple numerical invariants like the Euler characteristic are not always sufficient to distinguish between non-homeomorphic spaces. To gain deeper insight, topologists turn to more sophisticated algebraic invariants, such as the fundamental group, $\\pi_1(X)$, and the homology groups, $H_n(X)$. These groups capture more complex information about the \"holes\" and connectivity of a space. This practice  guides you through the process of computing the first homology group, $H_1$, for two different spaces, illustrating how these powerful algebraic structures are derived and how they, too, can reveal surprising similarities between seemingly different objects.",
