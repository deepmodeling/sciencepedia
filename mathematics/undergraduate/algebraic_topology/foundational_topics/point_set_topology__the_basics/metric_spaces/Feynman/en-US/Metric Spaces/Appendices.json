To analyze the 'closeness' of two continuous functions, we can define a metric space on the set of functions, such as $(C([0,1]), d_{\\infty})$. This exercise  makes this abstract idea concrete by asking you to calculate the 'greatest distance' between two polynomial functions, transforming a topological question into a familiar calculus problem of finding a maximum value.",

While we are familiar with the Euclidean metric, other metrics can give rise to fascinating and non-intuitive geometries.

Due to building structures, all travel must occur along lines parallel to the coordinate axes (north-south or east-west).
