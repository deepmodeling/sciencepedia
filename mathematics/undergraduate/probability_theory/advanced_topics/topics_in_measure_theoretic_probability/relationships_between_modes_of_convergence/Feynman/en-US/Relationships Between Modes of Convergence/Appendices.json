This exercise explores that relationship through a classic hypothetical scenario involving a sequence of random variables that grow in magnitude while their support shrinks. By analyzing this sequence, you will gain a concrete understanding of why convergence in probability is a weaker condition than convergence in $L^1$, a crucial distinction for applying theorems like the Law of Large Numbers .",
