This practice problem  applies the concept to a tangible scenario of server stability, showing that if the sum of the probabilities of failure converges, the system is guaranteed to become perpetually stable. This exercise will challenge you to connect the abstract idea of a convergent series to a concrete conclusion about long-term reliability.",

            "problem": "A systems administrator is monitoring a web server. The monitoring starts on day $n=1$. For each day $n$, there is a probability $p_n$ that the server will crash. The crashes on different days are mutually independent events. The probability of a crash on any given day $n$ is given by the formula:\n$$\np_n = \\frac{\\ln(n)}{n^2} \\quad \\text{for } n \\ge 1\n$$\nwhere $\\ln(n)$ is the natural logarithm of $n$.\n\nThe server is said to achieve \"perpetual stability\" if there exists some day $N$ after which the server never crashes again (i.e., it crashes only a finite number of times).\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the long-term behavior of the server?\n\nA. Yes, the server almost surely becomes perpetually stable.\n\nB. No, the server almost surely crashes infinitely often.\n\nC. The probability that the server becomes perpetually stable is exactly $0.5$.\n\nD. The outcome cannot be determined because the crash events are not identically distributed.\n\nE. The outcome cannot be determined from the Borel-Cantelli lemmas because the independence of events is not a strong enough condition.",

The event that the server crashes infinitely often is the limsup event $\\limsup_{n\\to\\infty}A_{n}$, and the event of \"perpetual stability\" (only finitely many crashes) is its complement.\n\nWe evaluate the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}P(A_{n})=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\ln(n)}{n^{2}}$. To establish convergence, apply the integral test to the function $f(x)=\\frac{\\ln(x)}{x^{2}}$ on $[2,\\infty)$:\n$$\n\\int_{2}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\ln(x)}{x^{2}}\\,dx.\n$$\nIntegrate by parts with $u=\\ln(x)$ and $dv=x^{-2}\\,dx$, hence $du=\\frac{1}{x}\\,dx$ and $v=-x^{-1}$.

Independence is not required for this implication. Consequently,\n$$\nP(\\text{only finitely many crashes})=1,\n$$\nso the server almost surely becomes perpetually stable.\n\nAmong the choices, this corresponds to option A, and options B, C, D, and E are incorrect for the reasons: the series converges so infinitely many crashes have probability zero (not one), the probability is not exactly $\\frac{1}{2}$ but $1$, lack of identical distribution is irrelevant here, and the first Borel-Cantelli lemma suffices without needing independence.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the probability of the event $E$, which is that significant events occur infinitely often. Let $A_n$ be the event that a significant event occurs at time step $n$. According to the problem description, this happens if the pulse energy $X_n$ exceeds the threshold $T_n = c \\ln(n)$. Therefore, we define the event $A_n$ as:\n$$A_n = \\{X_n > c \\ln(n)\\}$$\nThe event $E$ is that $A_n$ occurs for infinitely many $n$. In the language of set theory, this is the limit superior of the sequence of events $\\{A_n\\}$, denoted $E = \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} A_n$ or $\\{A_n \\text{ i.o.}\\}$. The Borel-Cantelli lemmas relate the probability of this event to the sum of the probabilities of the individual events, $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty P(A_n)$.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the probability of a single event $A_n$. The random variable $X_n$ follows a standard exponential distribution. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) for a standard exponential random variable $X$ is $F_X(x) = P(X \\le x) = 1 - \\exp(-x)$ for $x \\ge 0$. The probability of $A_n$ is the tail probability $P(X_n > c \\ln n)$.\n$$P(A_n) = P(X_n > c \\ln n) = 1 - F_{X_n}(c \\ln n) = 1 - (1 - \\exp(-c \\ln n)) = \\exp(-c \\ln n)$$\nUsing the property of logarithms that $k \\ln(a) = \\ln(a^k)$ and the fact that $\\exp(\\ln(x)) = x$, we can simplify this expression:\n$$P(A_n) = \\exp(\\ln(n^{-c})) = n^{-c} = \\frac{1}{n^c}$$\n\nNext, we analyze the sum of these probabilities over all $n$:\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} P(A_n) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^c}$$\nThis is a p-series. The convergence of a p-series depends on the value of the exponent $p$. In our case, $p=c$. The series converges if $p > 1$ and diverges if $p \\le 1$. Therefore:\n- The series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^c}$ converges if $c > 1$.\n- The series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^c}$ diverges if $c \\le 1$.\n\nNow we apply the Borel-Cantelli lemmas.\nThe **First Borel-Cantelli Lemma** states that if the sum of the probabilities of the events is finite, i.e., $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} P(A_n) < \\infty$, then the probability of the events occurring infinitely often is zero.\nIn our case, for $c > 1$, the sum converges. Thus, by the First Borel-Cantelli Lemma:\n$$P(E) = P(A_n \\text{ i.o.}) = 0 \\quad \\text{if } c > 1.$$\n\nThe **Second Borel-Cantelli Lemma** states that if the events $A_n$ are independent and the sum of their probabilities is infinite, i.e., $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} P(A_n) = \\infty$, then the probability of the events occurring infinitely often is one.\nThe problem states that the random variables $\\{X_n\\}$ are independent. Since each event $A_n$ depends only on the corresponding $X_n$, the events $\\{A_n\\}$ are also independent. For $0 < c \\le 1$, the sum diverges. Thus, by the Second Borel-Cantelli Lemma:\n$$P(E) = P(A_n \\text{ i.o.}) = 1 \\quad \\text{if } 0 < c \\le 1.$$\n\nCombining these two results, we find that $P(E) = 1$ if $0 < c \\le 1$ and $P(E) = 0$ if $c > 1$.
