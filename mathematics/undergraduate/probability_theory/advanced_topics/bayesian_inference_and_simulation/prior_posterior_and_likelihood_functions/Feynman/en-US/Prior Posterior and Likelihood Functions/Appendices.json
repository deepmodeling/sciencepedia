This first practice provides a foundational exercise in this process, demonstrating how to combine a prior belief about a rate parameter with observed data. By working through this epidemiological scenario , you will see how a Gamma prior distribution for a Poisson rate $\\lambda$ elegantly combines with Poisson-distributed data to yield a new, updated Gamma posterior distribution, a property known as conjugacy.",

The number of new cases reported each week is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution with an unknown average rate parameter $\\lambda$. Based on preliminary studies of similar viruses in other regions, the epidemiologist's prior belief about $\\lambda$ is modeled by a Gamma distribution, $\\text{Gamma}(\\alpha, \\beta)$. The probability density function for this prior distribution is given by:\n$$p(\\lambda) = \\frac{\\beta^{\\alpha}}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\lambda^{\\alpha-1} \\exp(-\\beta \\lambda)$$\nfor $\\lambda > 0$, where $\\Gamma(\\alpha)$ is the Gamma function.

This practice delves into the comparison between two different ways of generating such a point estimate: the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) and the Bayesian posterior mean.

The probability, denoted by $\\theta$, that an electron injected into the material successfully passes through a potential barrier is unknown. Based on the material's theoretical design, the scientist has no prior preference for any particular value of $\\theta$, and thus assumes a uniform prior probability distribution for $\\theta$ over the interval $[0, 1]$.\n\nIn an experiment, $N$ electrons are independently injected into the material, and it is observed that exactly $k$ of them successfully pass through the barrier, where $0 < k < N$.\n\nTwo methods are proposed to estimate the value of $\\theta$ based on this experimental outcome.\n\n1.  **Method A**: Find the value of $\\theta$ that maximizes the probability of observing the experimental outcome of $k$ successes in $N$ trials.

This final practice explores the challenging scenario where zero successes are observed in a series of trials, a situation that requires a careful and nuanced approach to estimation.
