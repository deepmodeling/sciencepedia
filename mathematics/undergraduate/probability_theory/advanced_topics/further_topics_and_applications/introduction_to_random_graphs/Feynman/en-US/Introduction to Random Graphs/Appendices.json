This first exercise introduces a cornerstone technique: using linearity of expectation to count the occurrences of small substructures, or \"motifs,\" within a large graph. By calculating the expected number of \"open triads\" in a social network model, you will see how this powerful tool allows us to bypass the complex dependencies between different parts of the graph and arrive at a straightforward solution .",

An edge between any two vertices, representing a friendship, exists with a fixed probability $p$, independent of all other edges.\n\nA key structure in social network analysis is the 'open triad'. An open triad is defined as a set of three distinct individuals, let's call them Alex, Beth, and Chris, where exactly two friendships exist among them. For instance, Alex is friends with Beth, and Beth is friends with Chris, but Alex and Chris are not friends. This arrangement forms a two-step path between Alex and Chris.\n\nYour task is to calculate the expected number of distinct open triads in this network model. A single open triad is identified by its unique set of three individuals. Provide your answer as a closed-form analytical expression in terms of the total number of individuals, $N$, and the friendship probability, $p$.",

An open triad on a set of three distinct vertices occurs when exactly two of the three possible edges among them are present.\n\nFor any fixed unordered triple of distinct vertices, there are three potential edges.

            "introduction": "Building on our use of expectation, we now refine our analysis to address a more subtle but crucial concept: the distinction between a subgraph and an *induced* subgraph. While a simple subgraph search allows for extra connections, an induced subgraph requires a precise set of presences and absences of edges. This problem  on \"vulnerable linear cascades\" forces us to account for both the edges that must exist and those that must not, sharpening our understanding of graph properties.",

            "problem": "Consider a large-scale network of $n$ servers, where any two distinct servers are connected by a direct communication link with probability $p$, independently for each pair. This network can be modeled as an Erdős-Rényi random graph, denoted $G(n,p)$.\n\nWithin this network, we are interested in a specific topological feature: a \"vulnerable linear cascade\". This feature is defined as a set of four distinct servers arranged in such a way that they form an *induced* subgraph isomorphic to a path graph on four vertices, $P_4$. A path graph $P_k$ is a graph with $k$ vertices $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_k$ and $k-1$ edges $(v_1,v_2), (v_2,v_3), \\dots, (v_{k-1},v_k)$. An induced subgraph on a set of vertices contains exactly those edges from the original graph that connect vertices within the set. The \"vulnerable\" aspect implies that no shortcut links exist that could bypass the linear structure.\n\nDetermine the expected number of distinct vulnerable linear cascades (i.e., induced subgraphs isomorphic to $P_4$) in the random graph $G(n,p)$. Your final answer should be a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $n$ and $p$.",
