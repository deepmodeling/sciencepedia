This first exercise walks you through the essential calculation of these two key components: the variance, $\\sigma^2$, and the third absolute central moment, $\\rho$.

            "problem": "In digital signal processing, the error introduced when converting an analog signal to a digital one is often modeled as a random variable. Consider a simplified model where the quantization error for a single sample, denoted by the random variable $X$, follows a continuous uniform distribution on the interval $[-a, a]$, for some positive constant $a$.\n\nThe Berry-Esseen theorem quantifies the rate of convergence in the Central Limit Theorem. For a sum of $n$ independent and identically distributed random variables, the theorem provides a bound on the difference between the cumulative distribution function of the standardized sum and that of the standard normal distribution. This bound depends on two key parameters of the individual random variable $X$: the variance, $\\sigma^2 = E[(X-\\mu)^2]$, and the third absolute central moment, $\\rho = E[|X-\\mu|^3]$, where $\\mu = E[X]$ is the mean of $X$.\n\nYour task is to compute these two parameters for the quantization error model.
