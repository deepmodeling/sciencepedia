            "introduction": "Geometric probability often begins with the simplest possible space: a one-dimensional line. This classic \"broken stick\" problem is the perfect entry point, demonstrating how to translate a physical scenario into a mathematical model on an interval. By determining which break points satisfy the given condition, we can find the probability by comparing the length of the \"favorable\" region to the total length of the interval .",

            "problem": "A straight, rigid stick of length $L$ is represented by the continuous interval $[0, L]$ on the real number line. A point $x$ is chosen at random from a uniform distribution over this interval, causing the stick to break into two pieces. The lengths of these two pieces are $l_1 = x$ and $l_2 = L-x$.\n\nDerive the probability that the length of the longer piece is at least three times the length of the shorter piece.",

            "introduction": "Moving from one dimension to two, we can use the same core principle: probability as a ratio of measures. In this practice, we switch from comparing lengths to comparing areas. This exercise involves identifying a two-dimensional sample space—a rectangle—and then carving out the \"favorable\" region defined by a simple inequality, providing a clear and visual application of geometric probability in the Cartesian plane .",

For $y>2$, the condition $x>y$ cannot be met because $x\\le2$.

Although the scenario starts in one dimension—making two independent cuts on a wire—the most effective solution involves a clever visualization in two dimensions . By representing the two random cuts as a single point in a square, a set of otherwise complicated constraints becomes a simple geometric region whose area is straightforward to calculate.",
