The antenna has a characteristic effective length $L$. It is driven by an external source at a fixed angular frequency $\\omega$. This driving source causes charge to accumulate at the ends of the antenna, with the magnitude of the charge at one end oscillating sinusoidally with an amplitude $q_0$. The resulting time-dependent dipole moment leads to the radiation of electromagnetic waves.\n\nInitially, the antenna has a length $L_1$ and radiates a time-averaged power $P_1$. A new, miniaturized version of the antenna is fabricated. The new antenna is a geometrically similar copy of the original, but all of its linear dimensions, including its effective length, are reduced by a factor of 2. The new length is therefore $L_2 = L_1 / 2$. This new antenna is driven by the same external source, at the same angular frequency $\\omega$, and with the same charge amplitude $q_0$ as the original.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the new time-averaged radiated power, $P_2$, to the original time-averaged radiated power, $P_1$. Express your answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the ratio of the radiated power from two oscillating electric dipoles of different sizes but driven under specific similar conditions. The key is to find the relationship between the radiated power and the physical length of the antenna.\n\nFirst, we recall the formula for the total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole. The instantaneous power $P(t)$ radiated by a dipole with a time-varying dipole moment $\\vec{p}(t)$ is given by the Larmor formula generalized for dipoles:\n$$P(t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{6\\pi c} |\\ddot{\\vec{p}}(t)|^2$$\nwhere $\\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\ddot{\\vec{p}}(t)$ is the second time derivative of the dipole moment vector.\n\nThe antenna is modeled as a simple dipole with charge $\\pm q(t)$ separated by its effective length $L$. The dipole moment vector has a magnitude $p(t) = q(t) L$. The problem states that the charge oscillates sinusoidally with amplitude $q_0$ at an angular frequency $\\omega$. We can write the charge at one end as $q(t) = q_0 \\sin(\\omega t)$. The dipole moment is then:\n$$\\vec{p}(t) = q(t) L \\hat{z} = q_0 L \\sin(\\omega t) \\hat{z}$$\nwhere $\\hat{z}$ is a unit vector along the antenna's axis. The magnitude of the dipole moment is $p(t) = q_0 L \\sin(\\omega t)$, and its amplitude is $p_0 = q_0 L$.\n\nNext, we need to find the second time derivative of the dipole moment, $\\ddot{\\vec{p}}(t)$.\nFirst derivative:\n$$\\dot{\\vec{p}}(t) = \\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt} = q_0 L \\omega \\cos(\\omega t) \\hat{z}$$\nSecond derivative:\n$$\\ddot{\\vec{p}}(t) = \\frac{d^2\\vec{p}}{dt^2} = -q_0 L \\omega^2 \\sin(\\omega t) \\hat{z}$$\nThe magnitude squared of this vector is:\n$$|\\ddot{\\vec{p}}(t)|^2 = (q_0 L \\omega^2 \\sin(\\omega t))^2 = q_0^2 L^2 \\omega^4 \\sin^2(\\omega t)$$\n\nNow we can write the instantaneous radiated power:\n$$P(t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{6\\pi c} (q_0^2 L^2 \\omega^4 \\sin^2(\\omega t))$$\nThe problem asks for the time-averaged power, denoted as $P_{avg}$ or simply $P$. To find this, we need to average the term $\\sin^2(\\omega t)$ over one full period. The time average of $\\sin^2(\\omega t)$ is $\\langle \\sin^2(\\omega t) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSo, the time-averaged power is:\n$$P_{avg} = \\frac{\\mu_0 q_0^2 L^2 \\omega^4}{6\\pi c} \\langle \\sin^2(\\omega t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\mu_0 q_0^2 L^2 \\omega^4}{12\\pi c}$$\n\nNow we analyze the scaling of this power with the antenna's length $L$. The problem states that the angular frequency $\\omega$ and the charge amplitude $q_0$ are held constant for both the original and the new antenna. The physical constants $\\mu_0$ and $c$ are also, of course, constant. Therefore, we can see that the time-averaged power is proportional to the square of the antenna's length:\n$$P_{avg} \\propto L^2$$\n\nLet $P_1$ be the power radiated by the original antenna of length $L_1$, and $P_2$ be the power radiated by the new antenna of length $L_2$. We can write the ratio of the powers as:\n$$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{k L_2^2}{k L_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{L_2}{L_1}\\right)^2$$\nwhere $k = \\frac{\\mu_0 q_0^2 \\omega^4}{12\\pi c}$ is the constant of proportionality.\n\nThe problem states that the new antenna's linear dimensions are reduced by a factor of 2, so $L_2 = L_1 / 2$. Substituting this into the ratio equation:\n$$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{L_1 / 2}{L_1}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nThe ratio of the new power to the original power is $1/4$. The problem asks for this ratio to be expressed as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = 0.25$$\nTo express this with three significant figures, we write it as $0.250$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.250}$$", "id": "1925323"}, {"introduction": "Real-world radiating systems are often more complex than simple, rigid dipoles; they can be extended objects with their own mechanical dynamics.
