By applying principles from kinetic theory, you will derive the Maxwell slip condition, a more general boundary condition that accounts for velocity slip at the wall, revealing how macroscopic fluid properties like viscosity and boundary conditions emerge from molecular-level physics [@problem_id:1889252].", "problem": "In the study of fluid dynamics at very low pressures or on microscopic scales, the continuum hypothesis and its associated no-slip boundary condition begin to break down. This regime is characterized by a small but non-zero Knudsen number, $Kn = \\lambda/L \\ll 1$, where $\\lambda$ is the molecular mean free path and $L$ is a characteristic length scale of the flow. Near a solid surface, a thin region known as the Knudsen layer, with a thickness of order $\\lambda$, forms. Within this layer, the gas behavior is governed by kinetic theory rather than the Navier-Stokes equations.\n\nThe macroscopic effect of the Knudsen layer is the appearance of an effective slip velocity, $u_s$, at the surface. Consider a steady shear flow of a rarefied gas with velocity profile $u(y)$ parallel to a stationary flat plate located at $y=0$. The velocity gradient in the fluid just outside the Knudsen layer is $(\\frac{du}{dy})_w$. The slip velocity at the wall, $u_s = u(y=0)$, is empirically found to be proportional to this gradient. This relationship is known as the Maxwell slip condition and is written as:\n$$u_s = \\zeta \\left(\\frac{du}{dy}\\right)_w$$\nwhere $\\zeta$ is the slip coefficient, which carries the dimension of length.\n\nYour task is to derive an expression for this slip coefficient $\\zeta$. To do so, you will model the momentum exchange within the Knudsen layer using the following physical arguments and relations from kinetic theory:\n\n1.  Molecules that strike the wall at $y=0$ last experienced a collision, on average, at a distance of one mean free path ($y=\\lambda$) from the wall. Therefore, the average tangential velocity of molecules incident on the wall is assumed to be $u(\\lambda)$.\n2.  The interaction with the wall is described by the tangential momentum accommodation coefficient, $\\sigma$. A fraction $\\sigma$ of the incident molecules are reflected diffusely (i.e., they are re-emitted with zero average tangential velocity, corresponding to the wall's velocity). The remaining fraction, $(1-\\sigma)$, are reflected specularly, meaning their tangential velocity is conserved upon reflection.\n3.  The mass flux of molecules (number of molecules per unit area per unit time multiplied by molecular mass) incident on the surface is given by $J_{mass} = \\frac{1}{4}\\rho \\bar{c}$, where $\\rho$ is the gas density and $\\bar{c}$ is the mean thermal speed of the molecules.\n4.
