This phenomenon is not universal; it is intrinsically linked to the balance between how vorticity is carried along by the flow (advection) and how it spreads out due to viscosity (diffusion). This exercise [@problem_id:1737979] invites you to use powerful scaling analysis to compare the characteristic timescales of these two processes, revealing why separation is a dominant feature in high-Reynolds number flows, such as air over a wing, but negligible in low-Reynolds number regimes, like a bacterium swimming in water.", "problem": "Consider a two-dimensional, steady, incompressible flow with a free-stream velocity $U_{\\infty}$ past a bluff body of a characteristic length scale $D$. The fluid has a constant density $\\rho$ and a constant dynamic viscosity $\\mu$. The transport of vorticity, essential for understanding flow phenomena like separation, is governed by the 2D vorticity transport equation.

The term on the left represents the advection of vorticity by the flow, while the term on the right represents the diffusion of vorticity due to viscosity. Flow separation is typically associated with the accumulation of vorticity near the body's surface.\n\nTo analyze the dominant transport mechanism, we can compare the characteristic timescales for these two processes. Let $t_{adv}$ be the characteristic time required for the main flow to advect vorticity over the length of the body, and let $t_{diff}$ be the characteristic time required for vorticity to diffuse over this same length.\n\nUsing scaling analysis based on the parameters provided, derive an expression for the dimensionless ratio of these two timescales, $t_{diff} / t_{adv}$.
