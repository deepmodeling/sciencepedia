The design is inspired by the flight of samaras (maple tree seeds). The drag force, $F_d$, acting on an object moving through a fluid like air is commonly modeled in two different regimes based on the object's speed, $v$. For low speeds, the drag is linear ($F_d = k_1 v$), while for higher speeds, it is quadratic ($F_d = k_2 v^2$).
