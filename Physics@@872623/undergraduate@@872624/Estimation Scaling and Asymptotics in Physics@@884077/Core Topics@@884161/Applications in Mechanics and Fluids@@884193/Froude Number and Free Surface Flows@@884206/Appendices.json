When an object's speed $v$ exceeds the water wave speed $c$, the flow becomes supercritical ($Fr > 1$), resulting in a distinct V-shaped wake. This exercise demonstrates the beautiful analogy between this hydrodynamic wake and the Mach cone of a supersonic aircraft, allowing you to calculate a measurable feature—the wake angle $\\alpha$—directly from the Froude number using the relation $\\sin(\\alpha) = 1/Fr$ [@problem_id:1902615].", "problem": "A scale model of a new high-speed catamaran is being tested in a university's towing tank to study its hydrodynamics in coastal environments.

This phenomenon is analogous to the formation of a Mach cone by an object moving faster than the speed of sound. In hydrodynamics, the relevant speed is the propagation speed of surface waves, and the corresponding dimensionless number is the Froude number.\n\nFirst, we must determine the speed of surface waves in the shallow water limit. For waves whose wavelength is much larger than the water depth $h$, the wave speed, $c$, is given by:\n$$c = \\sqrt{gh}$$\nHere, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity and $h$ is the water depth.\n\nNext, we define the depth-based Froude number, $Fr_h$, which is the ratio of the object's speed $v$ to the shallow water wave speed $c$:\n$$Fr_h = \\frac{v}{c} = \\frac{v}{\\sqrt{gh}}$$\nA V-shaped wake is formed when the boat's speed is greater than the wave speed ($v > c$), which corresponds to a supercritical flow regime where $Fr_h > 1$.\n\nThe half-angle of the wake, $\\alpha$, is the angle between the direction of motion and the wake front.
