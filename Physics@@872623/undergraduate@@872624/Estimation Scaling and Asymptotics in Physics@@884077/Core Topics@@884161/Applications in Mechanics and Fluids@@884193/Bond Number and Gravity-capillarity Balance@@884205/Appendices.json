For a very small bubble, the forces due to surface tension are dominant, pulling the bubble into a nearly perfect spherical shape to minimize surface area energy. As the bubble's size increases, the effect of buoyancy becomes more pronounced. Specifically, the variation in hydrostatic pressure from the bottom to the top of the bubble creates a differential force that tends to flatten it.\n\nEstimate the critical radius of the bubble at which its shape begins to noticeably deviate from a sphere. This occurs when the deforming pressure associated with buoyancy becomes comparable in magnitude to the cohesive pressure from surface tension that maintains the spherical shape.\n\nAssume the molasses has a density of $\\rho = 1420 \\text{ kg/m}^3$ and the surface tension at the air-molasses interface is $\\gamma = 0.081 \\text{ N/m}$.
