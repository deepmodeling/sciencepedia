The circuit consists of a resistor of resistance $R$, a capacitor of capacitance $C$, and a small, unavoidable parasitic inductor of inductance $L$, all connected in series. At time $t=0$, a constant voltage $V_0$ is applied to the circuit. The capacitor is initially uncharged, and there is no initial current.\n\nThe governing differential equation for the current $I(t)$ in this RLC circuit is derived from Kirchhoff's voltage law.
