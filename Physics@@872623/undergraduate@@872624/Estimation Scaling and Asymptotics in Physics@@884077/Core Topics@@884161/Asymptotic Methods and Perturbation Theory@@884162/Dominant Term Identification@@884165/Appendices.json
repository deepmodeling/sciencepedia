For a specific type of neutral defect, the leading terms of the electrostatic potential $V$ at a radial distance $r$ from the center of the defect can be modeled by the expression:\n$$V(r) = \\frac{C_d}{r^2} + \\frac{C_q}{r^3}$$\nHere, $C_d$ and $C_q$ are non-zero constants determined by the defect's internal charge configuration, representing the effective dipole and quadrupole moments, respectively. An experimental setup is designed to probe this potential at a point far from the defect, where $r$ is significantly larger than any characteristic length scale of the defect itself.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the relative contributions of the two terms to the total potential in this far-field regime?\n\nA.
