The fiber has an attenuation rate of $\\alpha = 0.18$ dB/km, and the total length is $d = 25.0$ km.

The key principles are that for uncorrelated sources, their intensities add linearly, and the decibel scale is logarithmic.\n\nFirst, let's denote the initial sound intensity levels in the live rooms as $L_1 = 94.0$ dB and $L_2 = 103.0$ dB. The respective attenuations are $A_1 = 40.0$ dB and $A_2 = 45.0$ dB.\n\nAn attenuation in decibels corresponds to a subtraction from the sound intensity level.
