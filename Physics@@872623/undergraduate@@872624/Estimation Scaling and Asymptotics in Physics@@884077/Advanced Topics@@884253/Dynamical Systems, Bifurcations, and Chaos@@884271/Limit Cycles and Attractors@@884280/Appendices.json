The time evolution of the system is autonomous, and extensive observation has characterized the behavior of its trajectories.\n\nIt is found that the points $(0, 0)$, $(2, 0)$, and $(-2, 0)$ are fixed points, meaning trajectories starting at these exact points remain there for all time. For trajectories not starting at these points, the following behaviors are observed:\nAny trajectory that starts within a small disk of radius $0.1$ centered at the origin, i.e., in the region $x^2 + p^2  0.1^2$, inexorably spirals towards the point $(0, 0)$ as time goes to infinity.\nTrajectories starting arbitrarily close to the point $(2, 0)$ are always repelled, moving away from it over time.\nNear the point $(-2, 0)$, the dynamics are characteristic of a saddle point, where most nearby trajectories are deflected away, although some specific trajectories are drawn in before being cast out.\nFurthermore, the system exhibits a unique, isolated periodic trajectory, which is the circle $C$ defined by the equation $x^2 + p^2 = 4^2$.

A fixed point $(x^{\\ast},p^{\\ast})$ is an attractor if it is invariant and there exists an open neighborhood of initial conditions whose trajectories converge to it as $t \\to \\infty$ (asymptotic stability). A periodic orbit is an attractor (a stable limit cycle) if it is invariant and attracts an open set of initial conditions from both sides (inside and outside) as $t \\to \\infty$.\n\nFrom the given observations:\n1) The point $(0,0)$: Trajectories starting in the disk $x^{2}+p^{2}0.1^{2}$ spiral toward $(0,0)$ as $t \\to \\infty$. This implies $(0,0)$ is Lyapunov stable and asymptotically stable, hence a stable fixed point and an attractor.\n\n2) The point $(2,0)$: Trajectories starting arbitrarily close are repelled and move away over time. This is an unstable fixed point (a source or repeller), hence not an attractor.\n\n3) The point $(-2,0)$: The dynamics are those of a saddle. Saddles are not attractors because they do not attract an open set of initial conditions; only a measure-zero set (the stable manifold) converges to them, while generic trajectories are deflected away. Hence $(-2,0)$ is not an attractor.\n\n4) The circle $C$ given by $x^{2}+p^{2}=4^{2}$ is a unique periodic trajectory. Any trajectory with $0.1^{2}x^{2}+p^{2}\\infty$, not on $C$, approaches $C$ as $t \\to \\infty$, spiraling outward from the interior or inward from the exterior. Therefore $C$ is an invariant periodic orbit that attracts an open set from both sides; it is a stable limit cycle and thus an attractor.\n\nTherefore, the attractors are:\n- The stable fixed point at $(0,0)$.\n- The stable limit cycle $x^{2}+p^{2}=4^{2}$.\n\nAmong the options, this corresponds to one stable fixed point at $(0,0)$ and one stable limit cycle at $x^{2}+p^{2}=4^{2}$, which is option B.\n\nNote: The saddle at $(-2,0)$ is unstable and not an attractor; the repelling fixed point at $(2,0)$ is also unstable and not an attractor.
