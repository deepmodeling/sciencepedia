By working through this, you'll see firsthand how all physical dimensions can be elegantly expressed as powers of a single unit, energy.", "problem": "In theoretical high-energy physics, it is common to work in a system of natural units where fundamental constants are set to dimensionless values of 1. Consider such a system where the reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar$, and the speed of light in a vacuum, $c$, are defined to be dimensionless, i.e., $\\hbar = 1$ and $c = 1$. In this framework, all physical quantities such as mass, length, and time can be expressed dimensionally as powers of a single fundamental unit, which is conventionally chosen to be energy, $[E]$.\n\nNow, consider a simplified one-dimensional toy model for the binding force between two quarks, which can be approximated as a classical harmonic oscillator for small displacements. The restoring force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$, where $k$ is the effective spring constant of the interaction and $x$ is the displacement of a quark from its equilibrium position.\n\nThe dimension of this spring constant $k$ can be written in the form $[E]^{\\alpha}$, where $[E]$ represents the dimension of energy. Determine the numerical value of the exponent $\\alpha$.", "solution": "The goal is to determine the dimension of the spring constant $k$ in terms of energy in a system of natural units where $\\hbar=c=1$. We are given that the dimensions of $k$ can be expressed as $[E]^{\\alpha}$ and we need to find $\\alpha$.\n\nA good starting point is the formula for the potential energy stored in a spring, which is given by:\n$$\nU = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2\n$$\nHere, $U$ is the potential energy, $k$ is the spring constant, and $x$ is the displacement. For dimensional analysis, the dimensionless factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ can be ignored. The dimensional relationship is:\n$$\n[U] = [k] [x]^2\n$$\nBy definition, the dimension of potential energy $[U]$ is the dimension of energy, $[E]$. The dimension of displacement $[x]$ is the dimension of length, $[L]$. So, we have:\n$$\n[E] = [k] [L]^2\n$$\nTo find the dimension of $k$, we can rearrange this equation:\n$$\n[k] = \\frac{[E]}{[L]^2}\n$$\nNow, we must express the dimension of length, $[L]$, in terms of the dimension of energy, $[E]$, using the natural units conditions $\\hbar=1$ and $c=1$.\n\nFirst, let's use the speed of light, $c$. The dimensions of speed are length divided by time, $[L]/[T]$. Since $c=1$ (dimensionless), we have:\n$$\n[c] = \\frac{[L]}{[T]} = 1 \\implies [L] = [T]\n$$\nThis means that in this system of units, length and time have the same dimension.\n\nNext, we use the reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar$. The Planck-Einstein relation connects energy $E$ to angular frequency $\\omega$: $E = \\hbar\\omega$. The dimension of angular frequency $\\omega$ is inverse time, $[T]^{-1}$. Since $\\hbar=1$ (dimensionless), the dimensional relationship is:\n$$\n[E] = [\\hbar][\\omega] = 1 \\cdot [T]^{-1} \\implies [E] = [T]^{-1}\n$$\nFrom this, we can express the dimension of time in terms of energy:\n$$\n[T] = [E]^{-1}\n$$\nSince we found that $[L] = [T]$, the dimension of length is also:\n$$\n[L] = [E]^{-1}\n$$\nNow we can substitute this expression for the dimension of length back into our equation for the dimension of the spring constant $k$:\n$$\n[k] = \\frac{[E]}{[L]^2} = \\frac{[E]}{([E]^{-1})^2} = \\frac{[E]}{[E]^{-2}}\n$$\nUsing the rules of exponents, we can simplify this expression:\n$$\n[k] = [E]^{1 - (-2)} = [E]^{3}\n$$\nThe problem states that the dimension of the spring constant is $[E]^{\\alpha}$. By comparing our result with this form, we can identify the value of the exponent $\\alpha$.\n$$\n[E]^{\\alpha} = [E]^{3} \\implies \\alpha = 3\n$$\nThus, the value of the exponent is 3.
