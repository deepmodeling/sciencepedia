In both cases, the particle starts from the origin, $x(0) = 0$.\n\nCase A (Drift-Dominated Motion): The particle is propelled by a constant external force $F$ through a viscous fluid. In this simplified model, the particle's velocity is determined by the overdamped condition where the propulsive force is precisely balanced by a linear drag force. This drag is characterized by a friction coefficient $\\gamma$. For Case A, you should neglect any random thermal effects.\n\nCase B (Diffusion-Dominated Motion): The particle's propulsion system is disengaged ($F=0$), and it is left in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding fluid, which is at a constant absolute temperature $T$. The particle's motion is now a purely random walk (Brownian motion) driven by thermal fluctuations. This stochastic process is characterized by a diffusion coefficient $D$. The diffusion coefficient is related to the thermal energy and friction via the Einstein relation, $D=k_B T / \\gamma$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nDetermine the specific time $t^*$ at which the magnitude of the particle's displacement from the origin in Case A is equal to the root-mean-square displacement from the origin in Case B.

In the overdamped regime, the net force is zero, so the propulsive force balances the drag force:\n$$F - \\gamma \\frac{dx_A}{dt} = 0$$\nSolving for the velocity of the particle in Case A, which we denote as $v_A$, we get a constant drift velocity:\n$$v_A = \\frac{dx_A}{dt} = \\frac{F}{\\gamma}$$\nTo find the displacement of the particle from the origin at time $t$, we integrate the velocity from the initial condition $x_A(0) = 0$:\n$$x_A(t) = \\int_0^t v_A dt' = \\int_0^t \\frac{F}{\\gamma} dt' = \\frac{F}{\\gamma} t$$\nThis is the displacement from the origin for Case A at any given time $t$.\n\nNext, let's analyze Case B, the diffusion-dominated motion.\nIn this case, the external force is zero, and the particle's motion is governed by the overdamped Langevin equation:\n$$\\gamma \\frac{dx_B}{dt} = \\eta(t)$$\nHere, $\\eta(t)$ is a stochastic force representing random thermal collisions from the fluid molecules.

In addition to this diffusive motion, the particle is subject to a stochastic resetting process: at any instant in time, there is a constant probability rate $r$ that the particle is instantaneously relocated to the origin, $x=0$. After a sufficiently long time, the system reaches a non-equilibrium steady state, characterized by a stationary probability density function, $P_s(x)$, for the particle's position. Determine the analytical expression for this stationary probability density function $P_s(x)$ in terms of the position $x$, the diffusion coefficient $D$, and the resetting rate $r$.", "solution": "The evolution of the probability density function $P(x, t)$ for a particle undergoing free diffusion is described by the standard Fokker-Planck equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial P(x, t)}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 P(x, t)}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nWe must modify this equation to account for the stochastic resetting process.

The total probability removed from the system per unit time is $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} r P(x', t) dx'$. Since the total probability must be conserved (i.e., $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} P(x, t) dx = 1$ for all time), this integral equals $r$.
