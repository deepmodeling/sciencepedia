The initial configuration of the spins along the chain is an alternating pattern: {up, down, up, down}.\n\nTo analyze the macroscopic behavior of this system, we perform a real-space renormalization group transformation. This procedure involves coarse-graining the system by grouping spins into blocks. Specifically, we divide the 4-spin chain into non-overlapping, adjacent blocks of 2 spins each. A single new effective spin is then assigned to each block based on a \"majority rule\".\n\nThe majority rule is defined as follows: the value of the new block spin is determined by the sign of the sum of the spins within that block. If the sum is positive, the new spin is 'up' ($+1$). If the sum is negative, the new spin is 'down' ($-1$). In the event of a tie (i.e., the sum of spins is zero), the tie-breaking convention is to assign the new block spin the value 'up' ($+1$).\n\nAfter applying this block spin transformation once to the initial configuration, a new, shorter chain of effective spins is formed.
