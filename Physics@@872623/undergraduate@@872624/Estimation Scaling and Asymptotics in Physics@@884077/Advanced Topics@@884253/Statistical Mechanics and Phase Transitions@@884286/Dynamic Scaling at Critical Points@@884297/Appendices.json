Each site on the lattice is occupied by a tree with a probability $p$, or is empty with probability $1-p$. A fire can spread from a burning tree to any of its adjacent (non-diagonal) neighbors that also contain a tree.\n\nThis system exhibits a critical phenomenon at a specific tree density known as the percolation threshold, $p_c$. For $p > p_c$, there is a non-zero probability that a fire can spread indefinitely across an infinite forest. For $p < p_c$, any fire started on a single tree will be confined to a finite cluster of connected trees and will eventually extinguish itself.\n\nWe are interested in the behavior of the system when the tree density $p$ is close to, but slightly below, the critical threshold. Let the deviation from criticality be defined as $\\epsilon = p_c - p$, where $\\epsilon > 0$. The characteristic duration of a fire, $T$, is defined as the time it takes for a fire, initiated on a single randomly chosen tree, to burn out. We want to find how this duration $T$ scales with $\\epsilon$.\n\nThe following scaling relations are known to describe the system in the vicinity of the critical point ($\\epsilon \\to 0$):\n\n1.

Its scaling is given by $\\xi \\sim \\epsilon^{-\\nu}$, where $\\nu$ is the correlation length exponent.\n\n2.  Due to the tortuous, web-like structure of the clusters near criticality, they are considered fractal objects. The number of trees, $S$, within a typical cluster of linear size $\\xi$ is not proportional to $\\xi^2$ but scales as $S \\sim \\xi^{d_f}$, where $d_f$ is the fractal dimension of the cluster.\n\n3.  The dynamics of the fire spreading through a cluster are also non-trivial. The total time, $T$, required for a fire to burn through an entire connected cluster is found to depend on the total number of trees, $S$, in that cluster. This relationship is described by the scaling law $T \\sim S^{\\beta}$, where $\\beta$ is a dynamic exponent related to the propagation of the fire across the fractal structure.\n\nAssuming these three scaling relations hold, determine the exponent $\\alpha$ in the scaling law for the characteristic fire duration, $T \\sim \\epsilon^{\\alpha}$.

Consider a one-dimensional chain of quantum spins described by a Hamiltonian that depends on a tunable disorder parameter, $W$. At a critical disorder strength $W_c$, the system undergoes an MBL transition.\n\nThe dynamics near this critical point are characterized by scaling laws. A key quantity is the propagation time, $\\tau(L, W)$, defined as the characteristic time it takes for quantum information to spread across a subsystem of length $L$. Based on scaling theory, this time is hypothesized to take the form:\n$$\n\\tau(L, W) = L^z \\mathcal{F}\\left( \\frac{L}{\\xi} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $z$ is the dynamic critical exponent, $\\mathcal{F}$ is a universal scaling function, and $\\xi$ is the correlation length.
