The key difference between the two cases is the coordination number, $z$.\n\nFirst, we derive the general expression for the Curie temperature, $T_c$, within the mean-field approximation for an Ising model. The interaction part of the Hamiltonian for a single spin, $S_i$, interacting with its $z$ nearest neighbors is given by $H_i = -J S_i \\sum_{j=1}^{z} S_j$, where $S_k = \\pm 1$.\n\nIn the mean-field approximation, we replace the instantaneous value of each neighboring spin, $S_j$, with its thermal average, the magnetization per spin, $m = \\langle S_j \\rangle$. The Hamiltonian for the single spin $S_i$ then becomes an effective Hamiltonian:\n$$H_i^{\\text{MF}} = -J S_i \\sum_{j=1}^{z} m = -(Jzm) S_i$$\nThis is equivalent to a single spin in an effective magnetic field $B_{\\text{eff}} = Jzm$.\n\nThe average value of the spin $S_i$ at a temperature $T$ can be calculated using statistical mechanics.

Near $T_c$, the magnetization $m$ is infinitesimally small. We can therefore use the Taylor expansion for $\\tanh(x)$ for small $x$, which is $\\tanh(x) \\approx x$.\nLetting $x = \\frac{Jzm}{k_B T}$, the self-consistency equation becomes:\n$$m \\approx \\frac{Jzm}{k_B T}$$\nThis equation always has the trivial solution $m=0$, corresponding to the paramagnetic phase. For a non-trivial solution ($m \\neq 0$) to exist, we can divide by $m$ to get:\n$$1 \\approx \\frac{Jz}{k_B T}$$\nThe transition occurs at the temperature $T_c$ where this condition is met.
