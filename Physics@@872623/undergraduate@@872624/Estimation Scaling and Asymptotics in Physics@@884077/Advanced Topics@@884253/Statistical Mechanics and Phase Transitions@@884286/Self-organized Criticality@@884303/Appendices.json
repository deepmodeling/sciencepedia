In this model, individual \"grains\" are dropped one by one onto a one-dimensional array of sites. Each site can hold a certain number of grains. If the number of grains at a site exceeds a specific threshold, the site becomes unstable and \"topples,\" distributing its grains to its immediate neighbors. This can trigger a chain reaction, where neighboring sites also topple, leading to an \"avalanche.\" The size of an avalanche, denoted by $s$, is defined as the total number of toppling events that occur in a single chain reaction.\n\nAfter the system has been running for a long time, it reaches a \"critical\" state where avalanches of all sizes can occur. A physicist runs a simulation and records the frequency, $N(s)$, of observing an avalanche of a particular size $s$.

Consider a sandpile model defined on a very large two-dimensional square lattice, where each site $(i,j)$ holds an integer number of \"sand grains,\" denoted by its height $h(i,j)$. When a site's height exceeds a critical value $h_c$, the site becomes unstable and \"topples,\" distributing its grains to neighboring sites.\n\nWe will compare two different toppling rules for a system with a critical height of $h_c=4$.\n\n**Rule D (Deterministic):** An unstable site with height $h \\ge 4$ sends exactly one grain to each of its four nearest neighbors. The site's own height is reduced by 4 (i.e., $h \\to h-4$).\n\n**Rule S (Stochastic):** An unstable site with height $h \\ge 4$ sends a total of four grains to its neighbors. The four recipient neighbors are chosen independently and uniformly at random (with replacement) from the set of four nearest neighbors. After distributing the four grains, the site's own height is reduced by 4.\n\nSuppose that after a long time, both models have reached a statistical steady state. For the purpose of a simplified local analysis, we assume that the single-site height probability distribution, $P(h)$, is identical for both models and is given by:\n- $P(h=3) = p_3 = 0.15$\n- $P(h=2) = p_2 = 0.25$\n- $P(h=1) = p_1 = 0.40$\n- $P(h=0) = p_0 = 0.20$\n\nConsider a single toppling event at an arbitrary site.
