This next practice [@problem_id:1932389] explores such a scenario, using basic trigonometry to determine the height of a flagpole from ground-level measurements.

Standing on level ground, the student uses a laser distance measuring tool and finds the horizontal distance from their position to the base of the flagpole to be 40.0 m. The student then uses a simple protractor-based clinometer to measure the angle of elevation from their eye level to the top of the flagpole, obtaining a value of 29 degrees. The student's eye level is measured to be 1.75 m above the ground.\n\nAssuming the flagpole is perfectly vertical and the ground is perfectly flat, calculate the total height of the flagpole from the ground. Your final answer should be reported in meters, adhering to the rules for significant figures based on the precision of the provided measurements.", "solution": "Model the situation as a right triangle.
