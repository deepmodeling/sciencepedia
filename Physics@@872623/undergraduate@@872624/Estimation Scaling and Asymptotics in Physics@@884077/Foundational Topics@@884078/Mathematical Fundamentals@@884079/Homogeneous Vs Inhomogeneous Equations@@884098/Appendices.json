The beam has a constant Young's modulus $E$ and area moment of inertia $I$. An engineer analyzes the vertical deflection of this beam under two different loading conditions.\n\nIn the first scenario (Scenario A), the beam sags under its own weight, which is described by a uniform downward force per unit length, $w_0$. The magnitude of the maximum vertical deflection in this case is denoted by $d_A$.\n\nIn the second scenario (Scenario B), the beam's own weight is considered negligible. Instead, a single concentrated downward force $F$ is applied at the exact midpoint of the beam. The magnitude of the maximum vertical deflection in this case is denoted by $d_B$.\n\nThe total weight of the beam from Scenario A is equal to the magnitude of the concentrated force in Scenario B, i.e., $w_0 L = F$.\n\nCalculate the dimensionless ratio $\\frac{d_A}{d_B}$.", "solution": "Use Euler-Bernoulli beam theory.
