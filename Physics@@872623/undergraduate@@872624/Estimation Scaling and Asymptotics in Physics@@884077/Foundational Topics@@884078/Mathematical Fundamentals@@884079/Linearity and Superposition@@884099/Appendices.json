With the given step size $\\Delta = 1.0$, the function simplifies to $Q(v) = \\text{round}(v)$. The rounding rule for a value $x$ exactly halfway between two integers is to round to the integer with the larger absolute value. For instance, $\\text{round}(0.5) = 1$, $\\text{round}(1.5) = 2$, and $\\text{round}(-0.5) = -1$.\n\nLet's set $u_1 = u_2 = u$, where $u > 0$. We need to test the additivity condition:\n$Q(u+u) = Q(u) + Q(u)$\nThis simplifies to:\n$Q(2u) = 2Q(u)$\n\nSubstituting the definition of our specific quantizer, we get:\n$\\text{round}(2u) = 2 \\cdot \\text{round}(u)$\n\nWe are looking for the smallest positive value of $u$ for which this equality does **not** hold. Let's analyze the behavior of the equation for small positive values of $u$.\n\nLet's consider the interval $0 < u < 0.5$.\nFor any value of $u$ in this interval, the nearest integer to $u$ is 0.

For the additivity property to be violated, we need the LHS to be different from the RHS. That is, we require:\n$\\text{round}(2u) \\neq 0$\n\nFor the output of the round function to be non-zero, its argument must have an absolute value of at least 0.5. Since we are considering $u > 0$, the argument $2u$ is positive. Thus, we need:\n$2u \\ge 0.5$\nThis inequality gives us:\n$u \\ge 0.25$\n\nWe have two conditions for finding the smallest $u > 0$ that provides a counterexample:\n1.  The value of $u$ must be in the range $0 < u < 0.5$ (so that the RHS is zero).\n2.  The value of $u$ must satisfy $u \\ge 0.25$ (so that the LHS is non-zero).\n\nCombining these two conditions, the range for $u$ is $0.25 \\le u < 0.5$. The smallest value of $u$ in this range that causes a violation is $u = 0.25$.\n\nLet's verify this result by setting $u=0.25$.\nWe have $u_1 = 0.25$ and $u_2 = 0.25$.\n\nFirst, calculate the sum of the individual outputs (RHS):\n$Q(u_1) + Q(u_2) = Q(0.25) + Q(0.25)$\nSince $0.25$ is closer to 0 than to 1, $\\text{round}(0.25) = 0$.\nSo, $Q(0.25) + Q(0.25) = 0 + 0 = 0$.\n\nNext, calculate the output of the sum (LHS):\n$Q(u_1 + u_2) = Q(0.25 + 0.25) = Q(0.5)$\nAccording to the specified rounding rule, for a value exactly halfway between integers, we round to the one with the larger absolute value. The integers nearest to 0.5 are 0 and 1. Since $|1| > |0|$, we have $\\text{round}(0.5) = 1$.\nSo, $Q(0.5) = 1$.\n\nComparing the LHS and RHS, we have $1 \\neq 0$. This confirms that for $u_1 = u_2 = 0.25$, the additivity property $Q(u_1+u_2) = Q(u_1)+Q(u_2)$ is violated.\nSince any $u$ in the range $0 < u < 0.25$ would result in $\\text{round}(u)=0$ and $\\text{round}(2u)=0$ (because $2u < 0.5$), the equality would hold. Therefore, $u=0.25$ is indeed the smallest positive value for which the violation occurs.\n\nThe question asks for the pair of values $(u_1, u_2)$, which is $(0.25, 0.25)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.25 & 0.25 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1589770"}, {"introduction": "Having explored how to identify nonlinearity, we now turn to the immense practical utility of systems that *are* linear.

The input pulse $x(t)$ starts at $t=1$ with an amplitude of 3, which can be represented by a step function of magnitude 3 starting at $t=1$, i.e., $3u(t-1)$. The pulse ends at $t=4$, which means the signal goes back to zero. This can be achieved by subtracting a step function of magnitude 3 starting at $t=4$, i.e., $-3u(t-4)$.
