The state of each system is determined by a random process equivalent to rolling a single fair, six-sided die. The outcome for each system, represented by an integer from 1 to 6, corresponds to one of six equally probable, discrete states.\n\nAfter each joint trial, a quantity $D$ is measured, defined as the absolute difference between the numerical outcomes of the two systems. For a very large number of trials, one can compute the theoretical average (mean) and the spread (variance) of these measurements.\n\nCalculate the theoretical mean and the theoretical variance of the random variable $D$.
