By ensuring that our physical laws are consistent across different systems of units, we can derive the essential dimensionless parameters that govern a system's behavior. This first practice challenges you to apply this powerful technique to a familiar system—a vibrating guitar string—to construct the dimensionless number that characterizes its damping [@problem_id:1896136].", "problem": "When a guitar string is plucked, its vibrations do not last forever; they gradually die out due to damping forces. One of the primary sources of this damping is the interaction of the string with the surrounding air. We can characterize the rate of this decay using a dimensionless number derived from the physical properties of the system.\n\nLet's model this system by considering the key physical parameters that govern the decay. We will focus on the string's fundamental mode of oscillation, which has a natural angular frequency $\\omega$. The string itself is characterized by its linear mass density, $\\mu$ (mass per unit length). The damping effect of the air is modeled as a viscous drag force. Assume that the damping force exerted on any small segment of the string is proportional to the segment's velocity and acts in the opposite direction. The damping force per unit length can thus be written as $f_{drag} = -\\beta v_y$, where $v_y$ is the transverse velocity of the string segment and $\\beta$ is a constant called the viscous damping coefficient per unit length.\n\nUsing only the principles of dimensional analysis, construct the unique dimensionless parameter, $\\Pi$, which characterizes how rapidly the oscillations decay. The parameter $\\Pi$ must be directly proportional to the damping coefficient $\\beta$. Express your answer for $\\Pi$ in terms of $\\omega$, $\\mu$, and $\\beta$.", "solution": "The problem asks us to construct a dimensionless parameter $\\Pi$ from three physical quantities: the angular frequency $\\omega$, the linear mass density $\\mu$, and the viscous damping coefficient per unit length $\\beta$. We will use the method of dimensional analysis.\n\nFirst, let's determine the physical dimensions of each quantity in terms of mass (M), length (L), and time (T).\n\n1.  **Angular frequency ($\\omega$)**: Angular frequency is the rate of change of phase angle, measured in radians per second. Since radians are dimensionless, the dimension of $\\omega$ is inverse time.\n    $$[\\omega] = [T]^{-1}$$\n\n2.  **Linear mass density ($\\mu$)**: This is defined as mass per unit length.\n    $$[\\mu] = \\frac{[M]}{[L]} = [M][L]^{-1}$$\n\n3.  **Viscous damping coefficient per unit length ($\\beta$)**: The problem states that $\\beta$ is the proportionality constant relating the damping force per unit length to the velocity.\n    $$[\\beta] = \\frac{[\\text{Force} / \\text{Length}]}{[\\text{Velocity}]}$$\n    The dimension of force is $[M][L][T]^{-2}$. So, the dimension of force per unit length is $\\frac{[M][L][T]^{-2}}{[L]} = [M][T]^{-2}$. The dimension of velocity is $[L][T]^{-1}$.\n    Therefore, the dimension of $\\beta$ is:\n    $$[\\beta] = \\frac{[M][T]^{-2}}{[L][T]^{-1}} = [M][L]^{-1}[T]^{-1}$$\n\nNow, we want to find a combination of these quantities that is dimensionless. Let's express the dimensionless parameter $\\Pi$ as a product of the given quantities raised to some unknown powers $a$, $b$, and $c$:\n$$ \\Pi = \\omega^a \\mu^b \\beta^c $$\n\nFor $\\Pi$ to be dimensionless, its dimensions must be $[M]^0 [L]^0 [T]^0$. We can write the dimensional equation as:\n$$ [M]^0 [L]^0 [T]^0 = [\\omega]^a [\\mu]^b [\\beta]^c $$\nSubstituting the dimensions of each quantity:\n$$ [M]^0 [L]^0 [T]^0 = ([T]^{-1})^a ([M][L]^{-1})^b ([M][L]^{-1}[T]^{-1})^c $$\n$$ [M]^0 [L]^0 [T]^0 = (T^{-a}) (M^b L^{-b}) (M^c L^{-c} T^{-c}) $$\nCombining the exponents for each fundamental dimension:\n$$ [M]^0 [L]^0 [T]^0 = M^{b+c} L^{-b-c} T^{-a-c} $$\n\nTo satisfy this equation, the exponent of each fundamental dimension on the right-hand side must be zero. This gives us a system of linear equations for $a$, $b$, and $c$:\n1.  For Mass (M): $b + c = 0$\n2.  For Length (L): $-b - c = 0$\n3.  For Time (T): $-a - c = 0$\n\nThe first and second equations are equivalent, yielding $b = -c$.\nThe third equation gives $a = -c$.\n\nWe have two independent equations for three unknowns. This means there is a family of solutions. However, the problem provides an additional constraint to ensure a unique answer: the parameter $\\Pi$ must be directly proportional to $\\beta$. In our expression $\\Pi = \\omega^a \\mu^b \\beta^c$, this means the exponent $c$ must be $1$.\n\nSetting $c=1$, we can find the values for $a$ and $b$:\nFrom $b = -c$, we get $b = -1$.\nFrom $a = -c$, we get $a = -1$.\n\nThus, the exponents are $a=-1$, $b=-1$, and $c=1$. Substituting these back into our expression for $\\Pi$:\n$$ \\Pi = \\omega^{-1} \\mu^{-1} \\beta^{1} $$\nThis can be written as:\n$$ \\Pi = \\frac{\\beta}{\\mu \\omega} $$\n\nThis dimensionless parameter represents the strength of the damping force relative to the inertial forces at the string's natural frequency. A larger value of $\\Pi$ corresponds to more significant damping and thus a more rapid decay of the oscillations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\beta}{\\mu \\omega}}$$", "id": "1896136"}, {"introduction": "Beyond pure dimensional analysis, many dimensionless numbers gain their physical significance by representing a ratio between two competing effects.
