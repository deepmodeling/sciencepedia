A typical internal combustion engine burns gasoline to produce energy, also releasing exhaust gases into the atmosphere.\n\nYour task is to calculate the mass of Carbon Dioxide (CO2), a primary greenhouse gas, that results from the complete combustion of exactly 1.00 liter of gasoline.\n\nFor your calculation, you should model gasoline as pure isooctane. The necessary chemical and physical constants are provided below:\n- Chemical formula of isooctane: $\\text{C}_{8}\\text{H}_{18}$\n- Density of isooctane: $\\rho = 0.703 \\text{ g/cm}^{3}$\n- Molar mass of Carbon (C): $M_C = 12.0 \\text{ g/mol}$\n- Molar mass of Hydrogen (H): $M_H = 1.0 \\text{ g/mol}$\n- Molar mass of Oxygen (O): $M_O = 16.0 \\text{ g/mol}$\n\nExpress your final answer for the mass of CO2 in kilograms (kg), rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the mass of Carbon Dioxide ($\\text{CO}_2$) produced from the complete combustion of 1.00 liter of gasoline, which we model as isooctane ($\\text{C}_{8}\\text{H}_{18}$).\n\nFirst, we determine the mass of 1.00 liter of isooctane using its density. We need to be careful with units. The volume is given as $V = 1.00 \\text{ L}$. We know that $1 \\text{ L} = 1000 \\text{ cm}^3$. The density is given as $\\rho = 0.703 \\text{ g/cm}^3$.\nThe mass $m_{\\text{isooctane}}$ is the product of volume and density:\n$$m_{\\text{isooctane}} = V \\times \\rho = (1.00 \\text{ L}) \\times (1000 \\text{ cm}^3 / \\text{L}) \\times (0.703 \\text{ g/cm}^3) = 703 \\text{ g}$$\n\nNext, we need to find the number of moles of isooctane. This requires calculating the molar mass of isooctane, $M_{\\text{isooctane}}$, using the given molar masses of its constituent atoms (C and H).\n$$M_{\\text{isooctane}} = 8 \\times M_C + 18 \\times M_H$$\n$$M_{\\text{isooctane}} = 8 \\times (12.0 \\text{ g/mol}) + 18 \\times (1.0 \\text{ g/mol}) = 96.0 \\text{ g/mol} + 18.0 \\text{ g/mol} = 114.0 \\text{ g/mol}$$\nNow, we can find the number of moles, $n_{\\text{isooctane}}$, in 703 g of isooctane:\n$$n_{\\text{isooctane}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{isooctane}}}{M_{\\text{isooctane}}} = \\frac{703 \\text{ g}}{114.0 \\text{ g/mol}} \\approx 6.1667 \\text{ mol}$$\n\nThe next step is to write the balanced chemical equation for the complete combustion of isooctane. Complete combustion means the hydrocarbon reacts with oxygen ($\\text{O}_2$) to produce only carbon dioxide ($\\text{CO}_2$) and water ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$).\n$$\\text{C}_{8}\\text{H}_{18} + \\text{O}_{2} \\rightarrow \\text{CO}_{2} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}$$\nWe balance the atoms on both sides:\n1.  Balance Carbon (C): There are 8 C atoms on the left, so we need 8 $\\text{CO}_2$ molecules on the right.\n    $\\text{C}_{8}\\text{H}_{18} + \\text{O}_{2} \\rightarrow 8 \\text{CO}_{2} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}$\n2.  Balance Hydrogen (H): There are 18 H atoms on the left, so we need 9 $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ molecules on the right (since each has 2 H atoms).\n    $\\text{C}_{8}\\text{H}_{18} + \\text{O}_{2} \\rightarrow 8 \\text{CO}_{2} + 9 \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}$\n3.  Balance Oxygen (O): On the right, we have $8 \\times 2 = 16$ O atoms in $\\text{CO}_2$ and $9 \\times 1 = 9$ O atoms in $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$, for a total of $16+9=25$ O atoms. So we need $25/2$ molecules of $\\text{O}_2$ on the left.\n    $\\text{C}_{8}\\text{H}_{18} + \\frac{25}{2} \\text{O}_{2} \\rightarrow 8 \\text{CO}_{2} + 9 \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}$\nMultiplying the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction gives:\n$$2 \\text{C}_{8}\\text{H}_{18} + 25 \\text{O}_{2} \\rightarrow 16 \\text{CO}_{2} + 18 \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}$$\nFrom the balanced equation, the molar ratio of isooctane to carbon dioxide is $2:16$, which simplifies to $1:8$. This means that for every 1 mole of isooctane combusted, 8 moles of carbon dioxide are produced.\n\nUsing this ratio, we can find the number of moles of $\\text{CO}_2$ produced, $n_{\\text{CO}_2}$:\n$$n_{\\text{CO}_2} = n_{\\text{isooctane}} \\times 8 = 6.1667 \\text{ mol} \\times 8 \\approx 49.333 \\text{ mol}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the mass of the produced $\\text{CO}_2$. First, we find the molar mass of $\\text{CO}_2$, $M_{\\text{CO}_2}$:\n$$M_{\\text{CO}_2} = M_C + 2 \\times M_O = 12.0 \\text{ g/mol} + 2 \\times (16.0 \\text{ g/mol}) = 12.0 \\text{ g/mol} + 32.0 \\text{ g/mol} = 44.0 \\text{ g/mol}$$\nThe mass of $\\text{CO}_2$, $m_{\\text{CO}_2}$, is then:\n$$m_{\\text{CO}_2} = n_{\\text{CO}_2} \\times M_{\\text{CO}_2} = 49.333 \\text{ mol} \\times 44.0 \\text{ g/mol} \\approx 2170.7 \\text{ g}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer in kilograms (kg), rounded to two significant figures.\n$$m_{\\text{CO}_2} = 2170.7 \\text{ g} = 2.1707 \\text{ kg}$$\nRounding to two significant figures gives:\n$$m_{\\text{CO}_2} \\approx 2.2 \\text{ kg}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.2}$$", "id": "1919127"}, {"introduction": "Beyond quantifying existing phenomena, estimation is a powerful tool for determining the absolute limits imposed by physical laws and material properties.
