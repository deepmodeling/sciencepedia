This effect arises because the energy carried by gravitational waves itself acts as a source for gravity.\n\nFirst, we derive the relationship between the measured strain and the resulting memory. The Christodoulou memory is a permanent change in the spacetime metric sourced by the total radiated energy of the gravitational waves. The change in the source's mass-energy due to gravitational wave emission is $\\Delta M_{GW} = \\Delta E_{GW}/c^2$. This change in the source's monopole moment leads to a permanent change in the asymptotic gravitational field. This change manifests as the memory effect, $\\Delta h^{\\text{mem}}$. A standard result relates the memory to the total radiated energy:\n$$\n\\Delta h^{\\text{mem}} \\approx \\frac{2G}{c^4 R} \\Delta E_{GW}\n$$\nThe total energy radiated, $\\Delta E_{GW}$, is the integral over time and area of the energy flux $F(t)$. Assuming isotropic radiation for simplicity, the total power is $P(t) = 4\\pi R^2 F(t)$. Integrating over the duration of the burst gives the total energy:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{GW} = \\int P(t) dt = 4\\pi R^2 \\int F(t) dt\n$$\nSubstituting the given formula for the Isaacson flux, $F(t) = \\frac{c^3}{16\\pi G}\\left(\\dot{h}_+^2(t)+\\dot{h}_\\times^2(t)\\right)$:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{GW} = 4\\pi R^2 \\int \\frac{c^3}{16\\pi G}\\left(\\dot{h}_+^2(t)+\\dot{h}_\\times^2(t)\\right) dt = \\frac{R^2 c^3}{4G} \\int \\left(\\dot{h}_+^2(t)+\\dot{h}_\\times^2(t)\\right) dt\n$$\nNow, substituting this expression for $\\Delta E_{GW}$ back into the formula for $\\Delta h^{\\text{mem}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta h^{\\text{mem}} \\approx \\frac{2G}{c^4 R} \\left( \\frac{R^2 c^3}{4G} \\int \\left(\\dot{h}_+^2(t)+\\dot{h}_\\times^2(t)\\right) dt \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta h^{\\text{mem}} = \\frac{R}{2c} \\int \\left(\\dot{h}_+^2(t)+\\dot{h}_\\times^2(t)\\right) dt\n$$\nThis is the relationship we need to implement. This memory is sourced by the total energy flux, so it is present for any gravitational wave, including linear and circular polarizations. The problem assumes the detector arm is aligned to measure the plus-polarization component of the memory, which we take to be this total scalar memory effect for this simplified model.
