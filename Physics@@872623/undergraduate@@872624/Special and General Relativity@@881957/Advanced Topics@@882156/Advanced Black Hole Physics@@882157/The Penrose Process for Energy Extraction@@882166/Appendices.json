This split is designed to be maximally efficient for energy extraction. The propellant is fired into the black hole on a special \"horizon-skimming\" trajectory. For any particle on such a trajectory, its energy $E_2$ and angular momentum $L_2$ (as measured by a distant stationary observer) are related by the equation $E_2 = \\Omega_H L_2$.

The general formula is given as $r_+ = r_g + \\sqrt{r_g^2 - a^2}$.\nSubstituting $a = r_g$:\n$$r_+ = r_g + \\sqrt{r_g^2 - r_g^2} = r_g + 0 = r_g$$\nSo, for an extreme Kerr black hole, the event horizon radius is equal to its gravitational radius.\n\nNext, we calculate the angular velocity of the event horizon, $\\Omega_H$.

First, its energy $E_2$ and angular momentum $L_2$ are related by the horizon-skimming condition:\n$$E_2 = \\Omega_H L_2$$\nSecond, the specific angular momentum imparted to the propellant is given by:\n$$L_2 = -\\beta M_0 c r_g$$\nWe can now find the energy $E_2$ by substituting the expression for $L_2$ and our calculated value for $\\Omega_H$ into the first equation.\n$$E_2 = \\left(\\frac{c}{2r_g}\\right) \\times (-\\beta M_0 c r_g)$$\nThe $r_g$ terms in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n$$E_2 = -\\frac{\\beta M_0 c^2}{2}$$\nThis is a crucial result. The energy of the captured fragment is negative, which is the defining feature of the Penrose process that allows for energy extraction.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the conservation of energy to find the payload's energy.**\nThe problem states that the total energy is conserved during the split. The initial total energy of the probe, falling from rest at infinity, is $E_0 = M_0 c^2$. After the split, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the payload ($E_1$) and the propellant ($E_2$).\nThe conservation law is:\n$$E_0 = E_1 + E_2$$\nWe need to solve for $E_1$:\n$$E_1 = E_0 - E_2$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $E_0$ and $E_2$:\n$$E_1 = (M_0 c^2) - \\left(-\\frac{\\beta M_0 c^2}{2}\\right)$$\n$$E_1 = M_0 c^2 + \\frac{\\beta M_0 c^2}{2}$$\nFactoring out the common term $M_0 c^2$, we arrive at the final expression for the energy of the escaping payload:\n$$E_1 = M_0 c^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{\\beta}{2}\\right)$$\nThe energy of the escaping payload is greater than the initial rest energy of the probe by a factor determined by the propulsion tuning parameter $\\beta$.
