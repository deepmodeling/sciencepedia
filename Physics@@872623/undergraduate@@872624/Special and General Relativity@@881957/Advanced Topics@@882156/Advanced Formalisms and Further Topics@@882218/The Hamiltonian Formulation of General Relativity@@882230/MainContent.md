## Introduction
General Relativity, Einstein's theory of gravity, is typically presented as a geometric theory where spacetime is a unified four-dimensional entity. However, to understand gravity as a dynamical system that evolves in time, or to pave the way for a quantum theory, we need a different perspective. This need is addressed by the Hamiltonian formulation of General Relativity, a powerful reframing of the theory developed by Arnowitt, Deser, and Misner (ADM) that lies at the heart of numerical relativity and the search for quantum gravity.

This article provides a systematic introduction to this essential formalism. In the first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, we will dissect the '3+1' decomposition of spacetime into space and time, defining the canonical variables and the fundamental constraints that govern gravitational dynamics. Next, in **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, we will explore how this framework is applied to real-world problems in cosmology, black hole physics, and the [initial value problem](@entry_id:142753), and see how it links to other fields like [quantum gravity](@entry_id:145111). Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section will offer concrete problems to solidify your understanding of these abstract concepts. By the end, you will grasp how Einstein's geometric theory can be transformed into a constrained Hamiltonian system, revealing its true dynamical nature and opening the door to some of the deepest questions in modern physics.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The Hamiltonian formulation of General Relativity, developed by Richard Arnowitt, Stanley Deser, and Charles Misner (ADM), recasts Einstein's theory into the language of canonical dynamics. This approach, also known as the "3+1" decomposition, is foundational for numerical relativity and quantum gravity. It achieves this by foliating the four-dimensional [spacetime manifold](@entry_id:262092) into a family of three-dimensional spacelike [hypersurfaces](@entry_id:159491), allowing one to view the evolution of geometry as a dynamical process in time.

### The 3+1 Decomposition of Spacetime

The core idea of the ADM formalism is to split spacetime into "space" and "time". We imagine a one-parameter family of spacelike [hypersurfaces](@entry_id:159491), $\Sigma_t$, indexed by a global time coordinate $t$. The geometry of the full four-dimensional spacetime is then described by two sets of quantities: the intrinsic geometry of each spatial slice, and the way these slices are stacked together within the larger spacetime.

To describe how we move from one slice $\Sigma_t$ to a neighboring slice $\Sigma_{t+dt}$, we use a time-flow vector field $\vec{t}$. This vector can be decomposed at any point into a component normal to the slice and a component tangential to it:
$$ \vec{t} = N \vec{n} + \vec{N} $$
Here, $\vec{n}$ is the future-pointing [unit vector](@entry_id:150575) field normal to the [hypersurfaces](@entry_id:159491) $\Sigma_t$. The two new quantities, the **[lapse function](@entry_id:751141)** $N(t, \vec{x})$ and the **[shift vector](@entry_id:754781)** $\vec{N}(t, \vec{x})$, encode the information about the [foliation](@entry_id:160209).

*   The **[lapse function](@entry_id:751141)** $N$ is a scalar field that measures the rate of flow of [proper time](@entry_id:192124), $\tau$, for an observer moving along the normal vector $\vec{n}$. Specifically, $d\tau = N dt$. A lapse of $N=1$ corresponds to a slicing where the [coordinate time](@entry_id:263720) $t$ matches the [proper time](@entry_id:192124) of these "Eulerian" observers. A non-uniform lapse means time flows at different rates at different spatial locations.

*   The **[shift vector](@entry_id:754781)** $\vec{N}$ is a vector field lying within each spatial slice. It describes how spatial coordinates are "dragged" from one slice to the next. If the shift is zero, spatial coordinate points on $\Sigma_t$ are connected to points with the same coordinate values on $\Sigma_{t+dt}$ by moving along the normal vector. A non-zero shift indicates that the coordinate grid is flowing relative to the normal direction.

With this decomposition, the four-dimensional spacetime line element $ds^2 = g_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu$ can be expressed in terms of the lapse, shift, and the induced spatial metric $h_{ij}$ on the [hypersurfaces](@entry_id:159491). The **spatial metric** $h_{ij}$ is simply the metric inherited by the three-dimensional slice from the ambient four-dimensional spacetime. The general form of the line element becomes:
$$ ds^2 = (-N^2 + h_{ij} N^i N^j) dt^2 + 2 h_{ij} N^j dt dx^i + h_{ij} dx^i dx^j $$
Here, indices $i, j$ run from 1 to 3, and $N^i$ are the components of the [shift vector](@entry_id:754781) $\vec{N}$. The spatial metric $h_{ij}$ acts as the metric for measuring distances *within* a given slice.

To make these concepts concrete, consider the Rindler spacetime, which describes the perspective of a uniformly accelerating observer in flat spacetime. Its [line element](@entry_id:196833) is given by $ds^2 = -(ax)^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2$, for a [constant acceleration](@entry_id:268979) $a$ and $x \gt 0$. By comparing this to the general 3+1 form, we can directly identify the ADM quantities [@problem_id:1865094]. The purely spatial part is $dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2$, so the spatial metric is the flat Euclidean metric, $h_{ij} = \delta_{ij}$. There are no cross terms like $dt dx^i$, which implies that the coefficient $2 h_{ij} N^j$ is zero. Since $h_{ij}$ is invertible, this means the [shift vector](@entry_id:754781) is zero: $N^i = 0$. Finally, the coefficient of $dt^2$ is $-(ax)^2$. In the general form, with $N^i=0$, this coefficient is $-N^2$. Equating them gives $-N^2 = -(ax)^2$, and since the lapse is positive by convention, we find $N = ax$. The Rindler frame thus corresponds to a [foliation](@entry_id:160209) of flat spacetime with a position-dependent [lapse function](@entry_id:751141) and zero shift.

The geometry of the spatial slices can change with time. This evolution is captured by two key quantities. The first is the time derivative of the spatial metric, $\dot{h}_{ij} \equiv \partial_t h_{ij}$. The second is the **[extrinsic curvature](@entry_id:160405)** tensor, $K_{ij}$, which measures how the three-dimensional slice is curved or "bent" relative to the four-dimensional spacetime it resides in. It is formally defined as half the Lie derivative of the spatial metric along the normal vector:
$$ K_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} \mathcal{L}_{\vec{n}} h_{ij} $$
The extrinsic curvature essentially measures the "velocity" of the spatial metric in the direction normal to the slice. The full time derivative of the metric, $\dot{h}_{ij}$, which is its Lie derivative along the full time-flow vector $\vec{t}$, can be related to the [extrinsic curvature](@entry_id:160405) and the [shift vector](@entry_id:754781) [@problem_id:1865105]. Using the linearity of the Lie derivative:
$$ \dot{h}_{ij} = \mathcal{L}_{\vec{t}} h_{ij} = \mathcal{L}_{N\vec{n} + \vec{N}} h_{ij} = N (\mathcal{L}_{\vec{n}} h_{ij}) + \mathcal{L}_{\vec{N}} h_{ij} $$
Substituting the definition of the extrinsic curvature, we arrive at a fundamental evolution equation:
$$ \dot{h}_{ij} = 2N K_{ij} + \mathcal{L}_{\vec{N}} h_{ij} $$
The term $\mathcal{L}_{\vec{N}} h_{ij}$ can be written in components as $D_i N_j + D_j N_i$, where $D_i$ is the covariant derivative compatible with the spatial metric $h_{ij}$, and $N_j = h_{ji}N^i$. This equation beautifully separates the change in the spatial metric into two parts: a "stretching" or "bending" normal to the slice, governed by the lapse and extrinsic curvature, and a "dragging" or shearing within the slice, described by the Lie derivative along the [shift vector](@entry_id:754781).

### The Canonical Variables and Hamiltonian Structure

To transition to a Hamiltonian framework, we must identify the canonical variables (the "positions" and "momenta"). In the ADM formalism, the configuration variable, analogous to position, is the spatial metric $h_{ij}(\vec{x})$. The corresponding [conjugate momentum](@entry_id:172203) variable is a [tensor density](@entry_id:191194) denoted $\pi^{ij}(\vec{x})$. Starting from the Einstein-Hilbert action, one can show that the momentum conjugate to $h_{ij}$ is given by:
$$ \pi^{ij} = \sqrt{h} (K^{ij} - K h^{ij}) $$
where $h = \det(h_{ij})$ is the determinant of the spatial metric, $h^{ij}$ is its inverse, and $K = h^{kl}K_{kl}$ is the trace of the [extrinsic curvature](@entry_id:160405), also known as the [mean curvature](@entry_id:162147). The momentum $\pi^{ij}$ is a measure of the rate of change of the spatial geometry, closely related to the [extrinsic curvature](@entry_id:160405). Note that the trace of the momentum, $\pi = h_{ij}\pi^{ij}$, is directly related to the trace of the extrinsic curvature: $\pi = \sqrt{h}(K - 3K) = -2\sqrt{h}K$.

Let's see how to compute the [canonical momentum](@entry_id:155151) in a specific scenario [@problem_id:1865093]. Consider a spatial slice with a diagonal metric $h_{ij} = \text{diag}(S_1^2, S_2^2, S_3^2)$ and a diagonal extrinsic curvature $K_{ij} = \text{diag}(k_1 S_1^2, k_2 S_2^2, k_3 S_3^2)$. The [inverse metric](@entry_id:273874) is $h^{ij} = \text{diag}(S_1^{-2}, S_2^{-2}, S_3^{-2})$, and the determinant is $h = S_1^2 S_2^2 S_3^2$. The trace of the extrinsic curvature is $K = h^{ab}K_{ab} = k_1 + k_2 + k_3$. If we impose a condition that the slice is "momentarily static" in volume, this corresponds to $K=0$, which implies $k_3 = -k_1 - k_2$. With $K=0$, the momentum simplifies to $\pi^{ij} = \sqrt{h} K^{ij}$. The contravariant components of the extrinsic curvature are $K^{ij} = h^{ik}h^{jl}K_{kl}$, which for a diagonal metric gives $K^{11} = (h^{11})^2 K_{11} = (S_1^{-2})^2(k_1 S_1^2) = k_1 S_1^{-2}$, and so on. Putting it all together with $\sqrt{h} = S_1 S_2 S_3$, the components of the [canonical momentum](@entry_id:155151) are:
$$ \pi^{11} = (S_1 S_2 S_3) (k_1 S_1^{-2}) = k_1 \frac{S_2 S_3}{S_1} $$
$$ \pi^{22} = (S_1 S_2 S_3) (k_2 S_2^{-2}) = k_2 \frac{S_1 S_3}{S_2} $$
$$ \pi^{33} = (S_1 S_2 S_3) (k_3 S_3^{-2}) = -(k_1 + k_2) \frac{S_1 S_2}{S_3} $$
This exercise demonstrates how the abstract definition of $\pi^{ij}$ is applied to a concrete geometry.

The pair $(h_{ij}, \pi^{ij})$ forms the canonical phase space of General Relativity. The dynamics on this phase space are governed by Poisson brackets. The fundamental Poisson bracket relations are:
$$ \{h_{ij}(\vec{x}), \pi^{kl}(\vec{y})\} = \frac{1}{2}(\delta_i^k \delta_j^l + \delta_i^l \delta_j^k) \delta^{(3)}(\vec{x}-\vec{y}) $$
$$ \{h_{ij}(\vec{x}), h_{kl}(\vec{y})\} = 0 $$
$$ \{\pi^{ij}(\vec{x}), \pi^{kl}(\vec{y})\} = 0 $$
The Dirac delta function $\delta^{(3)}(\vec{x}-\vec{y})$ reflects the local nature of the theory. The symmetric combination of Kronecker deltas on the right-hand side ensures consistency with the symmetry of $h_{ij}$ and $\pi^{kl}$. These relations are the classical foundation for any attempt at a [canonical quantization](@entry_id:148501) of gravity, where the Poisson brackets would be promoted to [commutators of operators](@entry_id:261812). As a simple application of this structure, one can compute the Poisson bracket of derived quantities, such as the metric determinant $h(\vec{x})$ and the momentum trace $\pi(\vec{y}) = h_{kl}(\vec{y})\pi^{kl}(\vec{y})$ [@problem_id:1865086]. Using the chain rule for functional derivatives and the fundamental brackets, one finds the elegant result:
$$ \{h(\vec{x}), \pi(\vec{y})\} = 3h(\vec{x})\delta^{(3)}(\vec{x}-\vec{y}) $$

### The Constraints and Dynamics

A remarkable feature of the Hamiltonian formulation of General Relativity is that it is a constrained theory. Not all choices of initial data $(h_{ij}, \pi^{ij})$ are permissible; they must satisfy a set of constraint equations. Furthermore, the Hamiltonian that generates [time evolution](@entry_id:153943) is itself constructed from these constraints.

This structure originates from a key feature of the Einstein-Hilbert action when written in 3+1 form: it contains no time derivatives of the [lapse function](@entry_id:751141) $N$ or the [shift vector](@entry_id:754781) $N^i$. As a result, their conjugate momenta are identically zero:
$$ p_N = \frac{\delta \mathcal{L}}{\delta \dot{N}} \approx 0, \qquad p_{N^i} = \frac{\delta \mathcal{L}}{\delta \dot{N}^i} \approx 0 $$
These are known as the **[primary constraints](@entry_id:168143)** of the theory. The symbol $\approx$ denotes a "weak equality," meaning the relation holds on the constraint surface of the phase space. The profound physical interpretation of these constraints is that $N$ and $N^i$ are not true dynamical degrees of freedom [@problem_id:1865095]. Instead, they function as Lagrange multipliers. Their values are not determined by equations of motion but can be chosen freely at each point in spacetime. This freedom corresponds precisely to the coordinate invariance (or [gauge freedom](@entry_id:160491)) of General Relativity: the freedom to choose a coordinate system is encoded in the arbitrary choice of the [lapse and shift](@entry_id:140910) functions, which specify the [foliation](@entry_id:160209).

The total Hamiltonian, or ADM Hamiltonian, is constructed as a [linear combination](@entry_id:155091) of [secondary constraints](@entry_id:165897), with the [lapse and shift](@entry_id:140910) acting as the Lagrange multipliers:
$$ H_{ADM} = \int d^3x \, ( N \mathcal{H} + N_i \mathcal{H}^i ) $$
The quantities $\mathcal{H}$ and $\mathcal{H}^i$ are the **Hamiltonian constraint** (or energy constraint) and the **[momentum constraint](@entry_id:160112)** (or [diffeomorphism](@entry_id:147249) constraint) densities. Their explicit forms are:
$$ \mathcal{H} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{h}} \left( \pi^{ij}\pi_{ij} - \frac{1}{2}(\pi)^2 \right) - \sqrt{h} R^{(3)} $$
$$ \mathcal{H}^i = -2 D_j \pi^{ij} $$
where $\pi_{ij} = h_{ik}h_{jl}\pi^{kl}$, $\pi = h_{kl}\pi^{kl}$, and $R^{(3)}$ is the Ricci [scalar curvature](@entry_id:157547) of the 3-metric $h_{ij}$. On physical solutions of Einstein's equations, the initial data must satisfy $\mathcal{H} \approx 0$ and $\mathcal{H}^i \approx 0$. These four equations constrain the 12 components of the phase space variables $(h_{ij}, \pi^{ij})$.

The [momentum constraint](@entry_id:160112) $\mathcal{H}^i \approx 0$ ensures that the theory is invariant under spatial [coordinate transformations](@entry_id:172727) (diffeomorphisms) within each slice. The Hamiltonian constraint $\mathcal{H} \approx 0$ is more subtle; it is related to the invariance of the theory under time reparametrizations. Physically, it implies that the total energy density of the system (gravity plus any matter) is zero.

This "zero-energy" concept can be made very clear in the context of a homogeneous and isotropic FLRW universe [@problem_id:1865115]. The first Friedmann equation, which governs the [expansion of the universe](@entry_id:160481), is:
$$ \left(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right)^2 + \frac{k}{a^2} = \frac{8\pi G}{3} \rho_m $$
where $a$ is the [scale factor](@entry_id:157673), $k$ is the curvature index, and $\rho_m$ is the matter-energy density. This equation is precisely the Hamiltonian constraint $\mathcal{H}=0$ for this simplified cosmological setting. We can rearrange it as:
$$ \frac{3}{8\pi G}\left(H^2 + \frac{k}{a^2}\right) - \rho_m = 0 $$
where $H=\dot{a}/a$ is the Hubble parameter. If we interpret $\rho_m$ as the matter energy density, then we can define an effective [gravitational energy](@entry_id:193726) density $\rho_g = -\frac{3}{8\pi G}(H^2 + k/a^2)$. The Hamiltonian constraint then takes the simple form $\rho_g + \rho_m = 0$. The negative energy attributed to the gravitational field exactly cancels the positive energy of matter and radiation.

The ADM Hamiltonian generates the [time evolution](@entry_id:153943) of any phase space functional $F$ via Hamilton's equation, $\dot{F} = \{F, H_{ADM}\}$. Let's verify this for the spatial metric itself, $h_{ij}$ [@problem_id:1865120].
$$ \dot{h}_{ij}(\vec{x}) = \{h_{ij}(\vec{x}), H_{ADM}\} = \int d^3y \{h_{ij}(\vec{x}), N(\vec{y})\mathcal{H}(\vec{y}) + N_k(\vec{y})\mathcal{H}^k(\vec{y})\} $$
Since $h_{ij}$ has a zero Poisson bracket with $h_{kl}$ and thus with $R^{(3)}$, we only need to consider terms involving $\pi^{kl}$. The calculation yields:
$$ \dot{h}_{ij} = \frac{\delta H_{ADM}}{\delta \pi^{ij}} = \frac{2N}{\sqrt{h}}\left(\pi_{ij}-\frac{1}{2}h_{ij}\pi\right) + D_{i}N_{j} + D_{j}N_{i} $$
This equation, derived from the canonical Hamiltonian formalism, is physically identical to the geometric evolution equation $\dot{h}_{ij} = 2N K_{ij} + \mathcal{L}_{\vec{N}} h_{ij}$ derived earlier. One can show that the term involving momenta is precisely $2N K_{ij}$ by inverting the definition of $\pi^{ij}$:
$$ K_{ij} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{h}}\left(\pi_{ij} - \frac{1}{2} h_{ij} \pi\right) $$
This beautiful consistency between the geometric and Hamiltonian pictures is a powerful confirmation of the formalism's correctness.

### Physical Observables and Degrees of Freedom

The Hamiltonian framework reveals the true number of physical degrees of freedom of the gravitational field [@problem_id:1865104]. At each spatial point, the phase space is initially described by the 6 components of the symmetric tensor $h_{ij}$ and the 6 components of the [symmetric tensor](@entry_id:144567) $\pi^{ij}$, for a total of 12 variables. However, these are not all independent.
*   The 4 constraint equations, $\mathcal{H} \approx 0$ and $\mathcal{H}^i \approx 0$, remove 4 dimensions from the physical phase space.
*   Furthermore, each of these "first-class" constraints generates a gauge transformation. The 4 gauge freedoms (one for time [reparametrization](@entry_id:176404), three for spatial coordinate changes) mean that another 4 dimensions correspond to coordinate choices, not physical reality.

The number of physical dimensions of the phase space is therefore $12 - 4 - 4 = 4$. Since a physical degree of freedom corresponds to a pair of phase space variables (a position and a momentum), the number of true, propagating degrees of freedom of the gravitational field is $4 / 2 = 2$. These correspond to the two [polarization states](@entry_id:175130) of gravitational waves.

While the local dynamics are constrained, the theory allows for global, conserved quantities in specific situations. For an [asymptotically flat spacetime](@entry_id:192015)—one that approaches the flat Minkowski metric at large distances—it is possible to define the total mass-energy of the system. This quantity, the **ADM mass** $M_{ADM}$, is a physical observable that represents the total mass as measured by a distant observer. It is defined by a surface integral at spatial infinity and, remarkably, corresponds to the value of the Hamiltonian for the system.

For a static, spherically symmetric spacetime, the ADM mass can be calculated from the asymptotic behavior of the spatial metric [@problem_id:1865109]. If the spatial line element is $d\sigma^2 = g_{rr}(r) dr^2 + r^2(d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2)$, the ADM mass is given by:
$$ M = \frac{1}{2} \lim_{r\to\infty} \left[ r \left( 1 - \frac{1}{g_{rr}(r)} \right) \right] $$
As an example, for a hypothetical metric component $g_{rr}(r) = 1 + \frac{\beta}{r} + \frac{\gamma}{r^2}$, the calculation yields:
$$ M = \frac{1}{2} \lim_{r\to\infty} \left[ r \left( 1 - \frac{1}{1 + \frac{\beta}{r} + \frac{\gamma}{r^2}} \right) \right] = \frac{1}{2} \lim_{r\to\infty} \frac{\beta + \frac{\gamma}{r}}{1 + \frac{\beta}{r} + \frac{\gamma}{r^2}} = \frac{\beta}{2} $$
This shows that the ADM mass is determined by the $1/r$ term in the deviation of the spatial metric from flatness. For the Schwarzschild solution, where $g_{rr} = (1-2M/r)^{-1}$, this formula correctly gives the mass $M$.

### The Problem of Time: An Advanced Topic

The fact that the Hamiltonian is a sum of constraints that must vanish on physical solutions leads to a deep conceptual puzzle known as the **[problem of time](@entry_id:202825)**. If the Hamiltonian is effectively zero, Hamilton's equations seem to imply that nothing evolves: $\dot{F} = \{F, H_{ADM}\} \approx 0$. This suggests that any true physical observable (a "Dirac observable") must have a vanishing Poisson bracket with the Hamiltonian and thus be a constant of motion. How can we describe a dynamic universe if all [observables](@entry_id:267133) are frozen in time?

This issue highlights the subtlety of defining what constitutes an "observable" and what constitutes "time" in a theory where spacetime itself is the dynamical entity. We can illustrate this with an example [@problem_id:1865123]. Consider a seemingly simple quantity: the total volume of a spatial slice, $V = \int d^3x \sqrt{h}$. Is this a physical observable? According to Dirac's criterion, it would be if its Poisson bracket with the Hamiltonian vanishes. Let's compute this bracket:
$$ \{H_{ADM}, V\} = \int d^3x \mathcal{P}(x) $$
A detailed calculation using the fundamental brackets and [functional calculus](@entry_id:138358) reveals that the integrand $\mathcal{P}(x)$ is not zero. It is given by:
$$ \mathcal{P}(x) = -\frac{N(x)}{2} h_{ij}(x) \pi^{ij}(x) + \sqrt{h(x)} D_{i} N^{i}(x) $$
Since $\{H_{ADM}, V\} \not\approx 0$, the total volume $V$ is *not* a Dirac observable. Its value is not invariant under the [gauge transformations](@entry_id:176521) generated by the Hamiltonian; it depends on the choice of slicing, which is determined by the freely specifiable [lapse and shift](@entry_id:140910) functions $N$ and $N^i$. Since time evolution is just such a gauge transformation, the volume of "space" changes with "time," but this change is dependent on our choice of time coordinate. This result perfectly encapsulates the [problem of time](@entry_id:202825): the quantities we intuitively think of as evolving, like the volume of the universe, are not [gauge-invariant observables](@entry_id:749727). Reconciling the apparent dynamics of the cosmos with the frozen formalism of canonical [quantum gravity](@entry_id:145111) remains one of the most profound open questions in theoretical physics.
