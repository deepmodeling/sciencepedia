The dynamical variables are the 3-metric on each slice, $h_{ij}$, and its conjugate momentum, $\\pi^{ij}$. The canonical momentum tensor is defined as\n$$ \\pi^{ij} = \\sqrt{h}(K^{ij} - K h^{ij}) $$\nwhere $h$ is the determinant of the spatial metric $h_{ij}$, $K_{ij}$ is the extrinsic curvature tensor of the slice, $K = h^{ab}K_{ab}$ is the trace of the extrinsic curvature (also known as the mean curvature), and indices are raised using the inverse spatial metric $h^{ij}$.\n\nConsider a particular spatial slice $\\Sigma_{t_0}$ in an anisotropic cosmological model.

We interpret \"momentarily static\" to mean that the volume of an infinitesimal region on the slice is not changing at this instant, which corresponds to the trace of the extrinsic curvature being zero, i.e., $K=0$. The \"accelerating\" nature is reflected in the fact that the individual components of $K_{ij}$ are not all zero, indicating the presence of anisotropic shear that is actively deforming the geometry of the slice.\n\nGiven the parameters $S_1, S_2, S_3, k_1, k_2$, and the condition $K=0$, determine the three non-zero components of the canonical momentum tensor: $\\pi^{11}$, $\\pi^{22}$, and $\\pi^{33}$.

Since $h_{ij}$ is diagonal, its inverse is simply the diagonal matrix with the reciprocals of the diagonal elements:\n$$ h^{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} S_1^{-2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & S_2^{-2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & S_3^{-2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe trace $K$ is defined as $K = h^{ab}K_{ab}$.
