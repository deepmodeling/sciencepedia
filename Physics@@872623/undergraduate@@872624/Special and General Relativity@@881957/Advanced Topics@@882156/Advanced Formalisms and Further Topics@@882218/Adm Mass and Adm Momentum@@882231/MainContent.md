## Introduction
In contrast to Newtonian physics, defining the total energy of a system in general relativity is a profound challenge. The energy of the gravitational field itself is not localizable, meaning one cannot simply integrate an energy density over a volume to find a total value. The Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) formalism provides an elegant solution to this problem for [isolated systems](@entry_id:159201)—those that become flat far away from all matter and energy. It establishes a way to measure a system's total energy and linear momentum by examining the geometry of spacetime from a great distance. This article delves into the ADM framework, bridging abstract geometric concepts with tangible physical phenomena.

The first chapter, "Principles and Mechanisms," will lay the theoretical groundwork, introducing the concept of [asymptotic flatness](@entry_id:158269) and deriving the integral formulas for ADM mass and momentum. The second chapter, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections," will demonstrate the power of these concepts by applying them to black holes, gravitational waves, and showing their relevance to fields like observational astronomy and thermodynamics. Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will offer concrete problems to solidify your understanding of how to calculate these fundamental quantities. We begin by exploring the core principles that allow us to weigh an entire universe.

## Principles and Mechanisms

In the study of general relativity, one of the most fundamental challenges is to define global [physical quantities](@entry_id:177395) for an entire spacetime, such as its total energy, momentum, and angular momentum. Unlike in Newtonian physics or special relativity, where energy can be summed over all components of a system, the energy of the gravitational field itself in general relativity is not localizable. There is no well-defined energy density for the gravitational field that can be integrated over a volume. The resolution to this conceptual problem lies in examining the system from afar. For an [isolated system](@entry_id:142067)—one that becomes progressively flatter at large distances—its total gravitational influence can be quantified by observing how the geometry of spacetime deviates from the flat Minkowski spacetime of special relativity at spatial infinity. The Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) formalism provides a rigorous mathematical framework for this approach.

### Asymptotic Flatness and the ADM Four-Momentum

The ADM formalism applies to **asymptotically flat spacetimes**. A spacetime is considered asymptotically flat if, at large distances from any matter or energy sources, the metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$ approaches the Minkowski metric $\eta_{\mu\nu}$. More precisely, on any spatial slice (a snapshot of the universe at a "moment in time"), we require that the spatial metric $g_{ij}$ approaches the Euclidean metric $\delta_{ij}$ in an appropriate coordinate system. The total energy and momentum of the spacetime are then encoded in the leading-order deviations from this flatness.

These quantities are captured by the **ADM four-momentum**, $P^{\mu}_{\text{ADM}}$, a four-vector whose components are computed as [surface integrals](@entry_id:144805) on a sphere of infinite radius. The timelike component, $P^0_{\text{ADM}}$, is the total ADM energy $E_{\text{ADM}}$ (or ADM mass $M_{\text{ADM}}$, in units where $c=1$), while the spatial components, $P^i_{\text{ADM}}$, constitute the total ADM linear momentum.

### The ADM Mass: Definition and Properties

The ADM mass represents the total mass-energy of an [isolated system](@entry_id:142067), including contributions from matter, radiation, and the gravitational field itself, as measured by a distant observer. It is defined by a surface integral evaluated at spatial infinity on a constant-time hypersurface. In asymptotically Cartesian coordinates $(x^1, x^2, x^3)$, where the spatial metric can be written as $g_{ij} = \delta_{ij} + h_{ij}$, the ADM mass is given by:

$$ M_{\text{ADM}} = \frac{1}{16\pi G} \lim_{r \to \infty} \oint_{S_r} (\partial_j h_{ij} - \partial_i h_{kk}) n^i dS $$

Here, $G$ is the [gravitational constant](@entry_id:262704), $h_{ij}$ is the perturbation of the spatial metric from the flat Euclidean metric, the indices $i, j, k$ run from 1 to 3, and summation is implied over repeated indices. The term $h_{kk}$ is the trace of the perturbation. The integral is taken over a two-dimensional sphere $S_r$ of coordinate radius $r = \sqrt{\sum_i (x^i)^2}$. The term $\partial_j$ denotes the partial derivative with respect to the coordinate $x^j$, and $n^i = x^i/r$ represents the components of the outward-pointing [unit normal vector](@entry_id:178851) in the flat background space. It is important to note that the true unit normal with respect to the physical spatial metric $g_{ij}$ must be used in more rigorous contexts, which may differ from $x^i/r$ if the metric is not diagonal [@problem_id:1813544]. For a conformally flat metric of the form $g_{ij} = \psi^4(r) \delta_{ij}$, the physical [unit normal vector](@entry_id:178851)'s components are $n^i = \psi^{-2}(r) \frac{x^i}{r}$, a correction factor that becomes crucial for precise calculations.

A fundamental check on any definition of total mass is that it must vanish for empty, flat spacetime. In Minkowski spacetime, the metric is globally flat, meaning the perturbation $h_{ij}$ is zero everywhere. Consequently, its derivatives are also zero, the integrand in the ADM formula vanishes, and the ADM mass is, as required, zero [@problem_id:1813547].

#### The Asymptotic Fall-off Condition

The convergence of the ADM mass integral depends critically on how quickly the [metric perturbation](@entry_id:157898) $h_{ij}$ decays to zero as $r \to \infty$. For a physically realistic isolated source, the gravitational field weakens in a specific way. This leads to the crucial **asymptotic fall-off condition**: for the ADM mass to be a well-defined, finite, non-zero quantity, the [metric perturbation](@entry_id:157898) must decay as $h_{ij} \sim \mathcal{O}(1/r)$.

Let's consider hypothetical spacetimes where this condition is not met to understand its importance.
*   If the [metric perturbation](@entry_id:157898) were to fall off more slowly, for instance as $h_{ij} \sim \mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{r})$, its derivatives would decay as $\partial_k h_{ij} \sim \mathcal{O}(r^{-3/2})$. The ADM integral integrand would then behave like $r^{-3/2}$ integrated over a surface area that grows as $r^2$, leading to a result that scales as $r^{1/2}$ and diverges as $r \to \infty$ [@problem_id:1813549]. Such a spacetime cannot represent an isolated system as it contains an infinite amount of energy.
*   Conversely, if the perturbation falls off more rapidly, such as $h_{ij} \sim \mathcal{O}(1/r^2)$, the derivatives fall off as $\mathcal{O}(r^{-3})$. The integral, scaling like $r^{-3} \times r^2 = r^{-1}$, vanishes in the limit $r \to \infty$. This implies that while the spacetime is curved, its curvature diminishes so quickly that it contains no net ADM mass [@problem_id:1813603].

Therefore, the $1/r$ behavior of the [metric perturbation](@entry_id:157898) is the "sweet spot" that corresponds to a finite, non-zero total mass for an isolated object. The coefficient of this $1/r$ term is what determines the value of the ADM mass. For example, for a static, spherically symmetric spacetime with a [metric perturbation](@entry_id:157898) $h_{ij} = \frac{2M}{r}\delta_{ij}$, direct calculation yields an ADM mass of precisely $M$ [@problem_id:1813603].

#### Calculating ADM Mass in Practice

While the integral definition is fundamental, the ADM mass can often be determined more easily by comparing the given metric to a standard form. For a static, spherically symmetric spacetime, the metric can always be written in Schwarzschild-like coordinates $(t, r, \theta, \phi)$, where the line element takes the form:
$$ ds^2 = -f(r) c^2 dt^2 + \frac{1}{g(r)} dr^2 + r^2(d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2) $$
For an [asymptotically flat spacetime](@entry_id:192015), the functions $f(r)$ and $g(r)$ must approach 1 as $r \to \infty$. By comparing their [asymptotic expansions](@entry_id:173196) to that of the Schwarzschild metric, where $f(r) = g(r) = 1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2 r}$, we can identify the ADM mass. Specifically, if $g_{00} = -f(r) c^2 \approx -c^2(1 - \frac{2GM_{\text{ADM}}}{c^2 r})$ for large $r$, the mass can be read off directly from the coefficient of the $1/r$ term.

This technique is powerful because it works regardless of the initial coordinate system. For instance, one might encounter a metric in coordinates where the geometry is not immediately obvious. By performing a coordinate transformation to the standard "areal radius" form (where spheres of constant radius $r$ have area $4\pi r^2$), the metric can be compared to the Schwarzschild solution to extract the ADM mass without needing to compute any [surface integrals](@entry_id:144805) [@problem_id:1813590].

### The ADM Momentum

The spatial components of the ADM four-momentum, $P^i_{\text{ADM}}$, constitute the [total linear momentum](@entry_id:173071) of the system. While the ADM mass is determined by the asymptotic form of the *spatial* metric components ($h_{ij}$), the ADM momentum is sourced by the asymptotic behavior of the *mixed* time-space components of the metric, $g_{0i}$ [@problem_id:1813588]. In the [3+1 decomposition](@entry_id:140329) of spacetime, these components correspond to the **[shift vector](@entry_id:754781)** $N_i$, which describes how the spatial coordinate grid is "dragged" or shifted from one time slice to the next. A non-zero [shift vector](@entry_id:754781) at infinity indicates a net flow or "gravitational current," which carries momentum.

The formal definition of the ADM momentum involves the **extrinsic curvature** $K_{ij}$ of the spatial slice:
$$ P_i^{\text{ADM}} = \frac{1}{8\pi G} \lim_{r \to \infty} \oint_{S_r} (K_{ij} - K g_{ij}) n^j dS $$
where $K = g^{ij}K_{ij}$ is the trace of the extrinsic curvature. The extrinsic curvature measures how the spatial slice is embedded within the 4D spacetime—essentially, it quantifies the "velocity" of the spatial geometry's evolution in time.

A crucial consequence arises for **static spacetimes**. A spacetime is static if it possesses a timelike Killing vector field that is also hypersurface-orthogonal. This geometric condition implies the existence of a special family of spatial slices that are "at rest" with respect to the flow of time. On these slices, the extrinsic curvature $K_{ij}$ is identically zero everywhere. Since the ADM momentum formula is built from $K_{ij}$, it follows directly that the ADM momentum of any static, [asymptotically flat spacetime](@entry_id:192015) must be zero [@problem_id:1813571]. This provides a deep geometric reason for the physical intuition that a truly static, unchanging system cannot have any net momentum.

### Key Theorems and Applications

#### Conservation of ADM Four-Momentum

For any isolated system described by an [asymptotically flat spacetime](@entry_id:192015) that evolves according to Einstein's field equations, the total ADM [four-momentum](@entry_id:161888) $P^{\mu}_{\text{ADM}}$ is a conserved quantity. This conservation law is a profound consequence of Noether's theorem applied to general relativity. The [asymptotic symmetries](@entry_id:155403) of the spacetime—invariance under time translations and spatial translations at infinity—lead directly to the conservation of ADM energy and momentum, respectively.

This conservation holds even for highly dynamic systems, such as the inspiral and merger of two black holes, which lose enormous amounts of energy via gravitational waves. This presents an apparent paradox: if energy is radiated away, how can the total energy be constant? The resolution lies in distinguishing between two different definitions of mass. The ADM mass is the total energy of the entire system for all time, as measured at *spatial infinity*. It includes the energy that will eventually be radiated away. In contrast, the **Bondi mass** is a measure of energy defined at *[null infinity](@entry_id:159987)* (i.e., for light rays reaching infinite distance). The Bondi mass decreases over time as gravitational waves carry energy away from the system. The constant ADM mass can be thought of as the initial Bondi mass of the system before any radiation occurs, or equivalently, as the final Bondi mass of the remnant plus the total energy carried away by all gravitational waves emitted during the process [@problem_id:1813608].

#### The Positive Mass Theorem

One of the most significant results related to ADM mass is the **Positive Mass Theorem**. It states that for any [asymptotically flat spacetime](@entry_id:192015) whose matter sources satisfy the **dominant energy condition** (which physically means that energy density is non-negative and cannot flow faster than the speed of light), the ADM mass must be non-negative: $M_{\text{ADM}} \ge 0$. Furthermore, the theorem states that $M_{\text{ADM}} = 0$ if and only if the spacetime is the flat Minkowski spacetime.

This theorem provides a mathematical foundation for the stability of empty space—it cannot decay into states with negative energy. The requirement of the dominant energy condition is essential. If one considers hypothetical "exotic matter" that violates this condition, such as a "ghost" scalar field with a negative kinetic energy, it is possible to construct solutions with negative ADM mass. Such fields would contribute a negative energy density to the system, potentially making the total ADM mass negative and leading to profound physical instabilities [@problem_id:1813576].

#### Connection to Newtonian and Special Relativistic Energy

The abstract definition of ADM mass beautifully connects to more familiar concepts of energy from Newtonian physics and special relativity. For a single, isolated object of proper mass $m$ moving with a non-relativistic velocity $v \ll c$, the ADM energy can be shown to be approximately:
$$ E_{\text{ADM}} \approx mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}mv^2 $$
This is precisely the rest energy plus the Newtonian kinetic energy. We can compare this with the exact expression for energy from special relativity, $E_{SR} = \gamma mc^2$, where $\gamma = (1 - v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$. Expanding $E_{SR}$ for small $v/c$ gives:
$$ E_{SR} = mc^2 \left(1 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{v^2}{c^2} + \frac{3}{8}\frac{v^4}{c^4} + \dots \right) = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \frac{3}{8}m\frac{v^4}{c^2} + \dots $$
The ADM energy correctly reproduces the rest mass and the classical kinetic energy. The difference between the full [relativistic energy](@entry_id:158443) and the post-Newtonian ADM approximation only appears at the next order, in the term proportional to $v^4/c^2$ [@problem_id:1813595]. This remarkable consistency demonstrates how the geometric definition of [mass in general relativity](@entry_id:267463) seamlessly incorporates our established understanding of energy in the appropriate physical limits.
