A fundamental question is whether an object we currently observe could have been outside our particle horizon at the instant it emitted that light.\n\nConsider a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe evolving according to a power-law scale factor $a(t)$. An astronomer observes light from a distant galaxy that was emitted at cosmic time $t_e$ and received on Earth at the present time $t_0$.\n\nThe proper distance to our particle horizon at the time of emission $t_e$ is given by the expression:\n$$d_H(t_e) = a(t_e) \\int_{0}^{t_e} \\frac{c \\, dt'}{a(t')}$$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe proper distance to the galaxy from our location, also measured at the time of emission $t_e$, is given by:\n$$d_G(t_e) = a(t_e) \\int_{t_e}^{t_0} \\frac{c \\, dt'}{a(t')}$$\n\nThe astronomer wishes to determine if it is possible for the galaxy to have been receding from us faster than the expansion of our own particle horizon at that moment in time.

Substituting this into our inequality:\n$$\\int_{t_e}^{t_0} \\frac{dt'}{K (t')^{2/3}}  \\int_{0}^{t_e} \\frac{dt'}{K (t')^{2/3}}$$\nThe constant $1/K$ can be cancelled from both sides. We are left with evaluating the integrals of $(t')^{-2/3}$. The indefinite integral is $\\int (t')^{-2/3} dt' = \\frac{(t')^{1/3}}{1/3} = 3(t')^{1/3}$.\n\nNow we evaluate the definite integrals:\nThe left-hand side (LHS) is:\n$$[3(t')^{1/3}]_{t_e}^{t_0} = 3(t_0^{1/3} - t_e^{1/3})$$\nThe right-hand side (RHS) is:\n$$[3(t')^{1/3}]_{0}^{t_e} = 3(t_e^{1/3} - 0^{1/3}) = 3t_e^{1/3}$$\nThe inequality becomes:\n$$3(t_0^{1/3} - t_e^{1/3})  3t_e^{1/3}$$\n$$t_0^{1/3} - t_e^{1/3}  t_e^{1/3}$$\n$$t_0^{1/3}  2t_e^{1/3}$$\nRaising both sides to the power of 3, we get:\n$$t_0  8t_e \\implies \\frac{t_0}{t_e}  8$$\nNow we must relate this ratio of times to the observable redshift $z$.

Evaluating the definite integral:\n$$\\frac{1}{K} [-(t')^{-1}]_{0}^{t_e} = \\frac{1}{K} \\left( -t_e^{-1} - \\lim_{t' \\to 0^+} (-(t')^{-1}) \\right) = \\frac{1}{K} \\left( -t_e^{-1} + \\infty \\right) = \\infty$$\nThe integral diverges. This means that in Model A, the particle horizon has an infinite proper size at any time $t_e  0$.\nThe distance to the galaxy, $d_G(t_e)$, is based on the integral $\\int_{t_e}^{t_0} (t')^{-2} dt'$, which is finite for any $0  t_e  t_0$.\nThe condition $d_G(t_e)  d_H(t_e)$ becomes the statement that a finite distance is greater than an infinite distance. This is impossible.\nTherefore, for the accelerating Model A, it is never possible for an observed galaxy to have been outside our particle horizon at the time of emission.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the results for both models:\n-   In Model D, the condition is met for $z  3$.\n-   In Model A, the condition can never be met.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1820137"}]}
