This powerful technique ensures that our equations are consistent and reveals how a physical quantity is expected to scale with fundamental constants and variables. This exercise provides hands-on practice with this essential skill, helping you build intuition for the structure of the perihelion precession formula by deducing its dependence on the star's mass $M$, the speed of light $c$, and the orbital size [@problem_id:1816964].", "problem": "A theoretical physicist is developing a simplified model for the anomalous perihelion precession of a planet orbiting a star. The precession angle per orbit, $\\Delta \\phi$, is proposed to have the functional form:\n\n$$ \\Delta \\phi = K G^a M^b c^p L^q $$\n\nIn this expression:\n- $K$ is a dimensionless numerical constant.\n- $G$ is the Newtonian gravitational constant.\n- $M$ is the mass of the central star.\n- $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum.\n- $L$ is the semi-latus rectum of the orbit, which has the dimension of length.\n\nFor the formula to be physically meaningful, the angle $\\Delta \\phi$ must be a dimensionless quantity. Furthermore, a key physical assumption, consistent with the equivalence principle, is that the precession effect is directly proportional to the mass $M$ of the star.\n\nThe fundamental dimensions of these physical quantities in the Mass (M), Length (L), and Time (T) system are provided as:\n- $[G] = M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2}$\n- $[M] = M$\n- $[c] = L T^{-1}$\n- $[L] = L$\n\nDetermine the unique integer exponents $(a, b, p, q)$ that make the formula dimensionally consistent and satisfy the specified physical assumption.

Angles are ratios of lengths (arc length to radius) and are therefore dimensionless. So, the dimensions of the left-hand side are $M^0 L^0 T^0$.\n\n$$[\\Delta \\phi] = M^0 L^0 T^0$$\n\nThe right-hand side is $K G^a M^b c^p L^q$. The constant $K$ is given as dimensionless, so its dimension is 1. We can write the dimensions of the right-hand side by substituting the dimensions of each component:\n\n$$[K G^a M^b c^p L^q] = [K] [G]^a [M]^b [c]^p [L]^q$$\n$$[K G^a M^b c^p L^q] = (1) \\cdot (M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2})^a \\cdot (M)^b \\cdot (L T^{-1})^p \\cdot (L)^q$$\n\nNow, we group the base dimensions (M, L, T) by adding their exponents:\n$$[K G^a M^b c^p L^q] = (M^{-a}) (L^{3a}) (T^{-2a}) \\cdot (M^b) \\cdot (L^p T^{-p}) \\cdot (L^q)$$\n$$[K G^a M^b c^p L^q] = M^{-a+b} L^{3a+p+q} T^{-2a-p}$$\n\nEquating the dimensions of the left and right sides:\n$$M^0 L^0 T^0 = M^{-a+b} L^{3a+p+q} T^{-2a-p}$$\n\nFor this equality to hold, the exponent of each fundamental dimension must be the same on both sides. This gives us a system of three linear equations:\n1. For Mass (M):  $-a + b = 0$\n2. For Length (L): $3a + p + q = 0$\n3. For Time (T):  $-2a - p = 0$\n\nWe have three equations but four unknowns ($a, b, p, q$), so we need another piece of information. The problem provides an additional physical constraint: \"the precession effect is directly proportional to the mass $M$ of the star.\" In the formula $\\Delta \\phi = K G^a M^b c^p L^q$, this means the exponent of $M$ must be 1. Therefore, we have our fourth condition:\n4. Physical constraint: $b = 1$\n\nNow we can solve the system.\nSubstitute $b=1$ into equation (1):\n$$-a + 1 = 0 \\implies a = 1$$\n\nNow substitute $a=1$ into equation (3):\n$$-2(1) - p = 0 \\implies p = -2$$\n\nFinally, substitute $a=1$ and $p=-2$ into equation (2):\n$$3(1) + (-2) + q = 0$$\n$$1 + q = 0 \\implies q = -1$$\n\nThus, the unique integer exponents are $a=1$, $b=1$, $p=-2$, and $q=-1$.
