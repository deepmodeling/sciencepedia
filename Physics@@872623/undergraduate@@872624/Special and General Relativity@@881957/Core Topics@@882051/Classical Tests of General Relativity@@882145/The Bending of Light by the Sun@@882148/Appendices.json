They are observing a very distant star that, from Earth's perspective, appears to pass very close to the Sun at certain times of the year. According to the theory of General Relativity, the light from this distant star is deflected by the Sun's gravitational field. This deflection angle, denoted by $\\alpha$, is the angle between the star's apparent position and its true position in the sky. The magnitude of this deflection depends on the 'impact parameter', $b$, which is defined as the perpendicular distance from the center of the Sun to the path of the light ray.\n\nDuring a first observation, the light from the star passes the Sun with an impact parameter $b_1$, resulting in a measured deflection angle $\\alpha_1$. Some time later, a second observation is made when the line of sight to the same star has changed. In this second observation, the light from the star passes the Sun with a new impact parameter, $b_2$, which is found to be exactly three times the initial impact parameter (i.e., $b_2 = 3b_1$). This results in a new deflection angle, $\\alpha_2$.\n\nCalculate the factor by which the deflection angle has changed, that is, compute the ratio $\\frac{\\alpha_2}{\\alpha_1}$.
