The expression becomes:\n$$ds^2 = g_{00}dt^2 + 2g_{01}dt dx + g_{11}dx^2$$\nThe problem provides the specific line element for our spacetime:\n$$ds^2 = -dt^2 + a^2(t) dx^2$$\nBy comparing the coefficients of the differential elements in the general expression and the given line element, we can identify the components of the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$.\nComparing the $dt^2$ terms: $g_{00} = -1$.\nComparing the $dx^2$ terms: $g_{11} = a^2(t)$.\nComparing the $dt dx$ terms: $2g_{01} = 0$, which implies $g_{01} = g_{10} = 0$.\n\nSo, the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ can be represented by the following $2 \\times 2$ matrix:\n$$[g_{\\mu\\nu}] = \\begin{pmatrix} g_{00} & g_{01} \\\\ g_{10} & g_{11} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & a^2(t) \\end{pmatrix}$$\nNow, we need to find the inverse of this matrix to obtain the components of the inverse metric tensor $g^{\\mu\\nu}$.
