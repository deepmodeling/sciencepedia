This first practice invites you to treat the space of all $2 \\times 2$ real symmetric matrices as a manifold. By identifying the number of independent parameters needed to define any such matrix, you will determine the manifold's dimension and see how a single, global coordinate chart can map this entire abstract space to a familiar Euclidean space, $\\mathbb{R}^n$ [@problem_id:1851187].", "problem": "Consider the set of all $2 \\times 2$ matrices with real entries. A matrix $M$ from this set is defined as symmetric if it is equal to its own transpose, i.e., $M = M^T$. The collection of all such $2 \\times 2$ real symmetric matrices forms a real vector space, which can be endowed with the structure of a smooth manifold. What is the dimension of this manifold?", "solution": "To determine the dimension of the manifold of $2 \\times 2$ real symmetric matrices, we need to find the number of independent real parameters required to specify an arbitrary element of this set. This number corresponds to the dimension of the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ to which the manifold is locally (and in this case, globally) homeomorphic, and thus defines the dimension of the manifold itself.\n\nLet's start by writing a general $2 \\times 2$ matrix $M$ with real entries $m_{ij}$:\n$$\nM = \\begin{pmatrix} m_{11}  m_{12} \\\\ m_{21}  m_{22} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThere are four independent real parameters required to define this general matrix: $m_{11}$, $m_{12}$, $m_{21}$, and $m_{22}$.\n\nThe condition for the matrix $M$ to be symmetric is that it must be equal to its transpose, $M^T$. The transpose of $M$ is given by:\n$$\nM^T = \\begin{pmatrix} m_{11}  m_{21} \\\\ m_{12}  m_{22} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSetting $M = M^T$, we get the following equation:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} m_{11}  m_{12} \\\\ m_{21}  m_{22} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} m_{11}  m_{21} \\\\ m_{12}  m_{22} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor two matrices to be equal, their corresponding entries must be equal. This gives us a system of four equations:\n1.  $m_{11} = m_{11}$\n2.  $m_{12} = m_{21}$\n3.  $m_{21} = m_{12}$\n4.  $m_{22} = m_{22}$\n\nThe first and fourth equations are tautologies and impose no constraints. The second and third equations are identical, providing a single constraint: $m_{12} = m_{21}$.\n\nThis constraint means that the entry $m_{21}$ is not an independent parameter; its value is determined by the value of $m_{12}$. Therefore, out of the initial four parameters, only three can be chosen independently. Let us choose $m_{11}$, $m_{12}$, and $m_{22}$ as the independent parameters.\n\nAn arbitrary $2 \\times 2$ real symmetric matrix, let's call it $S$, can thus be written in the form:\n$$\nS = \\begin{pmatrix} m_{11}  m_{12} \\\\ m_{12}  m_{22} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $m_{11}$, $m_{12}$, and $m_{22}$ can be any real numbers.\n\nThese three parameters uniquely specify any matrix in the set. We can define a global coordinate chart $\\phi$ that maps each symmetric matrix $S$ to a point in $\\mathbb{R}^3$:\n$$\n\\phi(S) = \\phi\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} m_{11}  m_{12} \\\\ m_{12}  m_{22} \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = (m_{11}, m_{12}, m_{22})\n$$\nThis map is a bijection from the space of $2 \\times 2$ real symmetric matrices to $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Since this map provides a one-to-one correspondence with the space $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the dimension of the manifold is the dimension of this target space.\n\nThe dimension of $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is 3.

This exercise uses the surface of an infinite cylinder to demonstrate this crucial idea [@problem_id:1851200]. You will investigate why a natural choice of coordinates, angle and height, fails to provide a single, valid chart covering the entire cylinder, highlighting the necessity of using an \"atlas\" of multiple, overlapping local charts to describe a manifold completely.", "problem": "Consider an infinite cylinder of radius $R  0$ embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space, $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The cylinder, denoted by $M$, is the set of points $(x,y,z)$ satisfying the equation $x^2 + y^2 = R^2$. We wish to describe points on this surface using a coordinate system consisting of an angle $\\theta$ and a height $z$.\n\nThis suggests defining a map $\\psi$ from a domain in the $(\\theta, z)$ plane to the cylinder $M$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ given by:\n$$ \\psi(\\theta, z) = (R\\cos\\theta, R\\sin\\theta, z) $$\nThe inverse of this map, $\\phi = \\psi^{-1}$, would then serve as a coordinate chart. For $\\phi$ to be a valid coordinate chart for a region on the cylinder, it must be a homeomorphism from an open subset $U \\subset M$ to an open subset $V \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$. A key property related to this is that the parameterization map $\\psi$ must be a smooth immersion, meaning its derivative map is injective everywhere on its domain.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the validity of using $(\\theta, z)$ as a coordinate system for the cylinder $M$?\n\nA. The map $\\psi(\\theta, z)$ is not a smooth function because the trigonometric functions are periodic, so $(\\theta, z)$ cannot form a valid coordinate chart on any part of the cylinder.\nB. The map $\\psi$ for $(\\theta, z) \\in [0, 2\\pi) \\times (-\\infty, \\infty)$ provides a single, valid coordinate chart that covers the entire cylinder $M$.\nC. The tangent vectors corresponding to the coordinates, $\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial\\theta}$ and $\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial z}$, are linearly dependent whenever $\\sin\\theta=0$, which prevents the coordinates from forming a valid chart on any region containing these points.\nD. A single coordinate chart based on $(\\theta, z)$ can never cover the entire cylinder, but it is possible to define a valid local chart on a proper open subset of the cylinder, for example, by removing a single vertical line.\nE. The mapping from the cylinder's $(x,y,z)$ points to the $(\\theta, z)$ coordinates is everywhere discontinuous due to the multi-valued nature of the arctangent function required to find $\\theta$, making it impossible to form a valid chart.", "solution": "We parameterize the cylinder $M=\\{(x,y,z)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}:x^{2}+y^{2}=R^{2}\\}$ by\n$$\n\\psi(\\theta,z)=(R\\cos\\theta,R\\sin\\theta,z).\n$$\nFirst, $\\psi$ is smooth because it is built from smooth functions. Its partial derivatives are\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial\\theta}(\\theta,z)=(-R\\sin\\theta,R\\cos\\theta,0),\\qquad \\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial z}(\\theta,z)=(0,0,1).\n$$\nTo check immersion, we verify linear independence of these two tangent vectors for all $(\\theta,z)$. Suppose $a\\,\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial\\theta}+b\\,\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial z}=(0,0,0)$. Looking at the third component gives $b=0$.

Therefore $\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial\\theta}$ and $\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial z}$ are linearly independent everywhere, so $\\psi$ is a smooth immersion. This directly contradicts the claim in option C that dependence occurs when $\\sin\\theta=0$, since at such $\\theta$ we have $\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial\\theta}=(0,\\pm R,0)$, which is never a multiple of $(0,0,1)$.\n\nNext consider injectivity and the chart topology. On $\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}$, $\\psi$ is not injective because $\\psi(\\theta,z)=\\psi(\\theta+2\\pi,z)$ for all $(\\theta,z)$. If we restrict to $[0,2\\pi)\\times\\mathbb{R}$, then $\\psi$ becomes bijective onto $M$ (the seam $\\theta=0$ is included while $\\theta=2\\pi$ is excluded, removing the double representation). However, $[0,2\\pi)\\times\\mathbb{R}$ is not an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, so it cannot serve as the domain $V$ of a valid coordinate chart. Hence option B fails because the chart image in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ must be open.\n\nIf instead we take the open domain $(0,2\\pi)\\times\\mathbb{R}$, then $\\psi$ is smooth and injective, and its image is $M$ with one vertical line removed, namely the set $\\{(R,0,z):z\\in\\mathbb{R}\\}$ corresponding to $\\theta=0$. That removed line is closed in $M$, so its complement is open in $M$. On this open subset, the inverse map is smooth: given $(x,y,z)$ with $(x,y)\\neq (R,0)$ and $x^{2}+y^{2}=R^{2}$, there is a unique $\\theta\\in(0,2\\pi)$ such that $\\cos\\theta=\\frac{x}{R}$ and $\\sin\\theta=\\frac{y}{R}$, and then $z$ is the same. This defines a smooth inverse on that open subset. Therefore, $(\\theta,z)$ defines a valid local chart on a proper open subset of the cylinder (for example, the cylinder with a single vertical line removed), but no single chart based on $\\theta$ can cover the entire $M$ with an open domain in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ because covering all angles injectively forces a cut, which makes the $\\theta$-domain non-open if it covers the seam, or leaves out a vertical line if the domain is open. Thus a single $(\\theta,z)$-chart cannot cover all of $M$, though it works locally on $M$ minus a vertical line. This confirms option D.\n\nRegarding the remaining options: option A is false because periodicity does not destroy smoothness; $\\psi$ is smooth. Option E is false because while a globally continuous angle function does not exist on the entire circle, on suitable open subsets (avoiding a radial cut) one can choose a continuous and smooth branch of the angle, yielding valid local charts.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that a single $(\\theta,z)$-based chart cannot cover the entire cylinder, but valid local charts exist on proper open subsets such as the cylinder with one vertical line removed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1851200"}, {"introduction": "For an atlas of charts to define a *smooth* manifold, the change of coordinates between any two overlapping charts must be smooth.
