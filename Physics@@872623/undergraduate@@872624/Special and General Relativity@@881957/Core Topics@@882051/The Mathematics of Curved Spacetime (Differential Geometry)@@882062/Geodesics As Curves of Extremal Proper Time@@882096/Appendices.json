A stationary observer, Alice, remains at the spatial origin $x=0$. At time $t=0$, a probe, Bob, is launched from the origin. Bob travels at a constant velocity to reach the position $x = L/2$ at time $t = T/2$. Upon reaching this point, Bob instantaneously reverses its direction and travels back to the origin at a constant speed, arriving at $x=0$ at time $t=T$. Let $\\Delta\\tau_A$ be the total proper time that elapses for Alice between the events of Bob's departure and return (from $t=0$ to $t=T$). Let $\\Delta\\tau_B$ be the total proper time that elapses for Bob along its entire journey. All motion occurs in one spatial dimension. The speed of light in a vacuum is denoted by $c$.
