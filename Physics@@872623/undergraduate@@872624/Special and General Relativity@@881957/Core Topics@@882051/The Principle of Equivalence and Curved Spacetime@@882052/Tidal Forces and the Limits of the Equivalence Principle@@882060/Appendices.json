{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Tidal forces are not abstract concepts; they produce real, physical stresses within objects. This problem provides a concrete example by asking you to calculate the tensile stress on a rigid probe falling toward a planet. By analyzing the differential gravitational pull on the two ends of the probe, you will derive the internal tension, offering a quantitative glimpse into the \"spaghettification\" effect that characterizes gravity in General Relativity [@problem_id:1879450].", "problem": "A slender, uniform probe, designed for atmospheric analysis, is modeled as a rigid rod of length $L$, mass $m$, and constant cross-sectional area $A$. The probe is released from rest far from a non-rotating, spherical planet of mass $M$ and falls radially towards it. At a particular instant, the probe's center of mass is located at a radial distance $r_c$ from the planet's center. Assume that the length of the probe is much smaller than its distance from the planet's center, i.e., $L \\ll r_c$. The variation in the planet's gravitational field along the length of the probe causes internal forces to develop. Find an expression for the maximum tensile stress (force per unit area) that arises within the probe at this instant. Your answer should be expressed in terms of the given parameters: the gravitational constant $G$, the planet's mass $M$, the probe's mass $m$, its length $L$, its cross-sectional area $A$, and the radial distance $r_c$.", "solution": "Let the rod be oriented along the radial line at the instant of interest, with its center of mass at radius $r_c$.

The gravitational acceleration at position $r_c+u$ (taken positive outward) is\n$$\na_g(u)=-\\frac{G M}{\\left(r_c+u\\right)^{2}}.\n$$\nThe rod is in free fall, so it is convenient to work in the frame accelerating with the center of mass. To leading order for $L \\ll r_c$, the center-of-mass acceleration is $a_g(0)=-G M/r_c^{2}$, because the linear variation averages to zero over the symmetric interval.

This exercise probes the limits of that \"local\" approximation in a classic thought experiment involving an \"Einstein elevator\". By tracking the relative motion of two test masses inside a freely falling laboratory, you will quantify how tidal forces cause their separation to change over time, demonstrating that no finite-sized reference frame can truly eliminate a real gravitational field [@problem_id:1879460].", "problem": "An experiment is conducted inside a large, non-rotating \"Einstein elevator\" (a freely falling laboratory) to measure local gravitational gradients. The elevator is in a state of radial free-fall towards a non-rotating, spherical planet of mass $M$. At an instant when the elevator's center is at a radial distance $r_0$ from the planet's center, two small, identical test masses are placed inside, at rest relative to the elevator. They are positioned along the radial line connecting the elevator to the planet's center, one at a distance $\\Delta z$ above the center and the other at a distance $\\Delta z$ below the center, such that their initial separation is $d_0 = 2\\Delta z$. Assume that $d_0 \\ll r_0$. Due to the tidal forces of the planet, the separation between the masses will change over time. Find a symbolic expression for the time $T$ it takes for their separation distance to double.\n\nYou may assume that during this time $T$, the elevator's motion is such that the gravitational field parameters at its center can be considered constant for the purpose of calculating the tidal forces. Ignore any gravitational attraction between the test masses themselves. Express your answer in terms of the gravitational constant $G$, the planet's mass $M$, and the initial radial distance $r_0$.", "solution": "Let's set up a coordinate system with the origin at the center of the planet. Let the direction of free-fall be along the z-axis. The center of the Einstein elevator is at a position $\\vec{r}_c(t)$. At time $t=0$, its position is $\\vec{r}_c(0) = (0, 0, r_0)$. The two test masses are located at $\\vec{r}_1(t)$ and $\\vec{r}_2(t)$. At $t=0$, their positions are $\\vec{r}_1(0) = (0, 0, r_0 + \\Delta z)$ and $\\vec{r}_2(0) = (0, 0, r_0 - \\Delta z)$, where $\\Delta z = d_0/2$.\n\nThe gravitational field of the planet at a position $\\vec{r}$ is given by Newton's law of gravitation:\n$$ \\vec{g}(\\vec{r}) = -\\frac{GM}{r^3}\\vec{r} $$\nwhere $r = |\\vec{r}|$. The acceleration of any object in this field is simply $\\vec{g}(\\vec{r})$.\n\nThe elevator itself is in free-fall, so its center accelerates according to $\\vec{a}_c = \\vec{g}(\\vec{r}_c)$. The acceleration of the test masses as observed from within the non-inertial, freely falling frame of the elevator is the difference between their absolute acceleration and the acceleration of the frame's origin. This is the tidal acceleration. For a mass at position $\\vec{r}$ relative to the planet's center, its position relative to the elevator's center is $\\vec{\\delta r} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_c$. The tidal acceleration is:\n$$ \\vec{a}_{tidal}(\\vec{\\delta r}) = \\vec{g}(\\vec{r}_c + \\vec{\\delta r}) - \\vec{g}(\\vec{r}_c) $$\nFor small displacements $\\delta r \\ll r_c$, we can use a first-order Taylor expansion of the gravitational field:\n$$ g_i(\\vec{r}_c + \\vec{\\delta r}) \\approx g_i(\\vec{r}_c) + \\sum_{j=x,y,z} \\frac{\\partial g_i}{\\partial x_j}\\bigg|_{\\vec{r}_c} \\delta x_j $$\nSo, the components of the tidal acceleration are approximately $a_{tidal, i} \\approx \\sum_{j} \\frac{\\partial g_i}{\\partial x_j}\\bigg|_{\\vec{r}_c} \\delta x_j$.\n\nWe are interested in the motion along the z-axis. The z-component of the gravitational field is $g_z = -GM z (x^2+y^2+z^2)^{-3/2}$. We need its partial derivative with respect to $z$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial g_z}{\\partial z} = -GM \\left[ (x^2+y^2+z^2)^{-3/2} - 3z^2(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{-5/2} \\right] $$\nWe evaluate this at the center of the elevator, $\\vec{r}_c = (0, 0, r_0)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial g_z}{\\partial z}\\bigg|_{\\vec{r}_c} = -GM \\left[ (r_0^2)^{-3/2} - 3r_0^2(r_0^2)^{-5/2} \\right] = -GM [r_0^{-3} - 3r_0^{-3}] = \\frac{2GM}{r_0^3} $$\nThe other partial derivatives like $\\frac{\\partial g_z}{\\partial x}$ are zero at $\\vec{r}_c$. Thus, the tidal acceleration for a small vertical displacement $\\delta z$ from the center is:\n$$ a_{tidal, z} \\approx \\frac{2GM}{r_0^3} \\delta z $$\nLet $z'_1(t) = z_1(t) - z_c(t)$ and $z'_2(t) = z_2(t) - z_c(t)$ be the positions of the masses relative to the elevator's center. Their equations of motion within the elevator are:\n$$ \\ddot{z}'_1 = \\frac{2GM}{r_0^3} z'_1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\ddot{z}'_2 = \\frac{2GM}{r_0^3} z'_2 $$\nThe separation distance between the masses is $d(t) = z_1(t) - z_2(t) = z'_1(t) - z'_2(t)$. The equation of motion for the separation is:\n$$ \\ddot{d}(t) = \\ddot{z}'_1(t) - \\ddot{z}'_2(t) = \\frac{2GM}{r_0^3} (z'_1(t) - z'_2(t)) = \\frac{2GM}{r_0^3} d(t) $$\nThis gives the differential equation $\\ddot{d}(t) - \\omega^2 d(t) = 0$, where $\\omega^2 = \\frac{2GM}{r_0^3}$.\nThe general solution to this equation is $d(t) = A e^{\\omega t} + B e^{-\\omega t}$. We use the initial conditions to find the constants $A$ and $B$.\nAt $t=0$, the initial separation is $d(0) = d_0 = 2\\Delta z$. So, $A+B=d_0$.\nAt $t=0$, the masses are at rest relative to the elevator, so their relative velocity is zero, $\\dot{d}(0) = 0$.\nThe time derivative of the separation is $\\dot{d}(t) = A\\omega e^{\\omega t} - B\\omega e^{-\\omega t}$.\nAt $t=0$, $\\dot{d}(0) = \\omega(A-B) = 0$, which implies $A=B$.\nSolving the system of equations $A+B=d_0$ and $A=B$, we get $A=B=d_0/2$.\nThe separation as a function of time is:\n$$ d(t) = \\frac{d_0}{2}(e^{\\omega t} + e^{-\\omega t}) = d_0 \\cosh(\\omega t) $$\nWe want to find the time $T$ at which the separation doubles, i.e., $d(T) = 2d_0$.\n$$ 2d_0 = d_0 \\cosh(\\omega T) \\implies \\cosh(\\omega T) = 2 $$\nSolving for $T$:\n$$ \\omega T = \\text{arccosh}(2) \\implies T = \\frac{\\text{arccosh}(2)}{\\omega} $$\nUsing the logarithmic form for the inverse hyperbolic cosine, $\\text{arccosh}(x) = \\ln(x + \\sqrt{x^2-1})$:\n$$ \\text{arccosh}(2) = \\ln(2 + \\sqrt{2^2 - 1}) = \\ln(2 + \\sqrt{3}) $$\nSubstituting this and $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r_0^3}}$ into the expression for $T$:\n$$ T = \\ln(2 + \\sqrt{3}) \\sqrt{\\frac{r_0^3}{2GM}} $$\nThis is the final expression for the time it takes for the separation to double.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\ln(2 + \\sqrt{3}) \\sqrt{\\frac{r_0^3}{2GM}}}$$", "id": "1879460"}, {"introduction": "Does the mere presence of a massive body guarantee a gravitational frequency shift between two nearby points?
