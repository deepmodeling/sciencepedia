This exercise quantifies this phenomenon by exploring the concept of \"apparent weight\" in an accelerating reference frame. By analyzing the forces on a pilot executing a vertical loop, you will apply Newton's laws to distinguish between the constant gravitational force and the variable contact force that we perceive as weight, providing a concrete foundation for understanding fictitious forces [@problem_id:1832053].", "problem": "An aerospace engineer is analyzing the physiological stress on a pilot during a test flight of a new aerobatic aircraft. The planned maneuver involves the aircraft flying in a vertical circular loop of radius $r$ at a constant speed $v$. The pilot has a mass $m$. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$.\n\nIn an accelerating reference frame, like the cockpit of the aircraft, the occupant experiences an 'apparent weight' which is physically the contact force exerted on them by their surroundings (e.g., the seat). This apparent weight can differ significantly from their 'true weight', which is the gravitational force $mg$.\n\nDetermine the ratio of the pilot's apparent weight to their true weight when the aircraft is at the lowest point of the vertical loop. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $v$, $r$, and $g$.", "solution": "At the lowest point of the vertical loop, the forces on the pilot are the upward normal force from the seat, denoted by $N$, and the downward gravitational force $mg$. The required centripetal acceleration is directed upward toward the center of the loop with magnitude $v^{2}/r$.\n\nApplying Newton's second law in the radial (upward) direction gives\n$$\nN - mg = m\\frac{v^{2}}{r}.\n$$\nSolving for the normal force $N$,\n$$\nN = m\\frac{v^{2}}{r} + mg = m\\left(\\frac{v^{2}}{r} + g\\right).\n$$\nThe apparent weight is the normal force $N$, and the true weight is $mg$. Therefore, the ratio of apparent weight to true weight is\n$$\n\\frac{N}{mg} = \\frac{m\\left(\\frac{v^{2}}{r} + g\\right)}{mg} = 1 + \\frac{v^{2}}{rg}.\n$$\nThis expression is dimensionless and depends only on $v$, $r$, and $g$, as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1+\\frac{v^{2}}{rg}}$$", "id": "1832053"}, {"introduction": "Building on the idea of apparent weight, we can now explore one of Einstein's most profound insights: the equivalence principle. This principle states that the effects of uniform acceleration are locally indistinguishable from the effects of gravity. This classic thought experiment puts you inside an accelerating, windowless vehicle and asks you to predict the behavior of a simple plumb line [@problem_id:1832068]. Your analysis will reveal how an observer within the accelerating frame perceives a \"fictitious\" gravitational field, demonstrating the deep connection between acceleration and gravity.", "problem": "An observer is inside a completely enclosed, windowless vehicle that is accelerating horizontally with a constant acceleration of magnitude $a$ along a perfectly straight and level path on Earth's surface. To determine the vehicle's acceleration, the observer hangs a small mass $m$ from a string of length $L$, creating a simple plumb line. In the accelerating frame of the vehicle, the plumb line hangs stationary at a constant angle $\\theta$ with respect to the vehicle's vertical axis. The local acceleration due to gravity is $g$.\n\nDerive a symbolic expression for the tangent of the angle, $\\tan(\\theta)$, in terms of the given parameters.", "solution": "Consider the frame attached to the accelerating vehicle. In this non-inertial frame, the plumb bob is stationary, so the net force on the mass is zero. The real forces are the weight $m g$ downward and the string tension $T$ along the string; in addition, there is a fictitious (inertial) force of magnitude $m a$ acting opposite the direction of the vehicle’s acceleration. Let the vehicle accelerate horizontally, and let $\\theta$ be the angle the string makes with the vehicle’s vertical.\n\nBy resolving forces along horizontal and vertical axes and applying equilibrium ($\\sum F_{x}=0$, $\\sum F_{y}=0$), we have:\n$$T \\sin(\\theta) = m a,$$\n$$T \\cos(\\theta) = m g.$$\n\nDividing the first equation by the second eliminates $T$ and $m$:\n$$\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{m a}{m g} = \\frac{a}{g}.$$\n\nThus, the tangent of the angle is the ratio of the vehicle’s horizontal acceleration to the gravitational acceleration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{a}{g}}$$", "id": "1832068"}, {"introduction": "The equivalence principle is powerful, but it comes with a crucial caveat: it holds true only *locally*. This final practice challenges you to probe the limits of this principle by devising an experiment to distinguish a real, non-uniform gravitational field from a perfectly uniform acceleration. By considering highly precise measurements of weight at different altitudes within a sealed room, you will discover the concept of tidal forces [@problem_id:1832091]. These subtle variations in the gravitational field are the true signature of spacetime curvature and the key to understanding why gravity is more than just a fictitious force on a global scale.", "problem": "An observer is in a sealed, windowless laboratory equipped with a highly sensitive spring scale and a reference mass $m$. The observer wants to determine their location from two possibilities: (1) the lab is at rest on the surface of a non-rotating, spherical planet of mass $M_p$ and radius $R_p$, or (2) the lab is in deep space, far from any significant gravitational sources, and is accelerating uniformly. The uniform acceleration $\\vec{a}$ of the lab in deep space is carefully calibrated to have a magnitude exactly equal to the magnitude of gravitational acceleration at the surface of the planet. The interior of the lab has a fixed vertical height $H$.\n\nTo distinguish between the two scenarios, the observer measures the force exerted by the mass on the spring scale (its \"weight\") at two locations: once at the floor of the lab, yielding a reading $F_{floor}$, and once at the ceiling, yielding a reading $F_{ceiling}$.\n\nAssuming the lab is located on the planet and that the height of the lab is much smaller than the planet's radius ($H \\ll R_p$), find the approximate magnitude of the difference in the measured forces, $\\Delta F = |F_{ceiling} - F_{floor}|$.
