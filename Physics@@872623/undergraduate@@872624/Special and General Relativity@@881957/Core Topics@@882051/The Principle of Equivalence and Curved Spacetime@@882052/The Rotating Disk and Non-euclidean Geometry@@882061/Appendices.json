By considering a simple rotating hoop, you will directly confront how Lorentz contraction leads to a geometry where the familiar Euclidean relationship between a circle's circumference and its radius, $C = 2\\pi R$, breaks down [@problem_id:1874616]. This exercise provides the first crucial piece of evidence that accelerated reference frames require a new, non-Euclidean geometric description.", "problem": "Consider a thin, rigid hoop of proper radius $R_0$, which is its radius as measured in its own rest frame. An inertial observer in a laboratory sets this hoop into rotation about its central axis, perpendicular to the plane of the hoop, with a constant angular velocity $\\omega$. According to this lab observer, every point on the hoop moves with a tangential speed $v = \\omega R_0$.\n\nThe lab observer then makes two measurements: the radius of the rotating hoop, $R_{lab}$, and its circumference, $C_{lab}$. In Euclidean geometry, the circumference and radius are related by the well-known formula $C = 2\\pi R$. However, special relativity predicts that the geometry experienced by the rotating system will appear non-Euclidean to the inertial observer.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the circumference measured by the lab observer, $C_{lab}$, to the value $2\\pi R_{lab}$, which is the circumference that would be expected in Euclidean geometry based on the observer's measurement of the radius. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $R_0$, $\\omega$, and the speed of light, $c$.", "solution": "Let the hoop have proper (rest) radius $R_{0}$ and proper (rest) circumference $C_{0}=2\\pi R_{0}$ when not rotating. The lab observer spins it to a constant angular velocity $\\omega$, so each point on the hoop has tangential speed $v=\\omega R_{0}$ as stated.\n\nSpecial relativity implies Lorentz contraction only along the direction of motion. For an element of the hoop aligned tangentially (parallel to the motion), its length as measured in the lab frame is contracted by the Lorentz factor\n$$\n\\gamma=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}.\n$$\nHence, the lab-measured length of each tangential element is its proper length divided by $\\gamma$. Because the speed $v$ is the same for all points on the hoop, all tangential elements contract by the same factor. Therefore, the lab-measured circumference is\n$$\nC_{lab}=\\frac{C_{0}}{\\gamma}=\\frac{2\\pi R_{0}}{\\gamma}.\n$$\nThe radius is perpendicular to the direction of motion, so there is no Lorentz contraction radially.
