There is no restoring force to produce oscillations, and no spontaneous transition to another stable circular orbit occurs without a change in conserved quantities.\n\nBecause each segment of the ring consists of independent geodesic particles, a random infinitesimal radial perturbation will send some particles inward and others outward, leading to the disintegration of the ring; the ultimate fate depends on the direction of each perturbation.
