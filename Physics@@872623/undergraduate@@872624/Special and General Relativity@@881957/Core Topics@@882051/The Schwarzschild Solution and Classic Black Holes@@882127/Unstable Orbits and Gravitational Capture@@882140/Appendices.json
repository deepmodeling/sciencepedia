While energy determines if a particle can reach the black hole from afar, angular momentum governs how closely it can pass without being captured.

The square of the specific energy, $(E/m)^2$, must be greater than or equal to the effective potential $V_{eff}(r)$ for the particle to be able to exist at a given radius $r$.
