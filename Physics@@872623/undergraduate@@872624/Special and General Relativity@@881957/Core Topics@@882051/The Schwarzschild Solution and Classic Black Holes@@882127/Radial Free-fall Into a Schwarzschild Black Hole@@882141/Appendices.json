The gravitational field outside the black hole is described by the Schwarzschild metric, which defines an event horizon at a radius known as the Schwarzschild radius, $R_S = 2GM/c^2$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe probe's position is given by the radial coordinate $r$. A distant observer, who is stationary with respect to the black hole, records the probe's motion using their own coordinate time, $t$. The probe's velocity as measured by this distant observer is the coordinate velocity, $v_{coord} = dr/dt$. The time measured by a clock traveling with the probe is the proper time, $\\tau$.\n\nFor this scenario, you are given the following fundamental equations of motion derived from the principles of General Relativity:\n1.

For a probe starting from rest at an infinite distance from the black hole, the conserved energy per unit rest mass has the specific value $e = c^2$.\n\nAs the probe falls from infinity towards the event horizon, the magnitude of its coordinate velocity, $|v_{coord}|$, does not increase indefinitely. Instead, it starts from zero, increases to a maximum value at a specific radius, and then decreases back to zero as the probe approaches the event horizon.\n\nYour task is to determine the exact maximum value of this coordinate speed, $|v_{coord}|_{max}$.
