A detailed proof using the divergence theorem in 4D shows that this integral is independent of the spacelike hypersurface chosen for integration, meaning it is the same for all inertial observers.\n\nTherefore, without any calculation, we can state that the total charge measured in the drone's frame S', $Q_{S'}$, must be identical to the total charge measured in the lab frame S, $Q_S$.\n$$Q_{S'} = Q_S$$\nA full, explicit calculation confirms this.
