This exercise moves beyond the abstract formula to a concrete, physical scenario involving an unstable particle. By calculating the particle's speed based on its observed lifetime and travel distance, you will directly apply the principles of time dilation to solve a problem representative of real-world particle physics experiments [@problem_id:1842906].", "problem": "An unstable elementary particle is generated at a specific point within a long, evacuated tube that is part of a laboratory experiment. The particle travels at a constant velocity $v$ down the axis of the tube. It is then detected at a point of decay, which is a distance $D$ away from its point of creation, as measured in the laboratory's frame of reference. The particle's proper lifetime, which is the time that would be measured by a clock traveling with the particle, is denoted by $\\tau_0$. A key design characteristic of this experiment is that the distance $D$ is precisely equal to the distance that light would travel in a vacuum during one proper lifetime of the particle. That is, the relationship $D = c \\tau_0$ holds, where $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum. Based on this information, determine the speed $v$ of the particle. Express your answer as a fraction of the speed of light, $c$.", "solution": "Let the particle’s speed be written as $v = \\beta c$, with the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^{2}}}$.
