Without loss of generality, let's place the origin of our coordinate system such that Event C occurs at $x_C = 0$ at time $t_C = 0$.\nThe coordinates for Event C in frame $S$ are $(x_C, t_C) = (0, 0)$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, in frame $S$, the impact of Pollux occurs at a distance $L$ from the impact of Castor along the positive x-axis. Therefore, the position of Event P is $x_P = L$.\nThe problem also states that the two events are simultaneous in frame $S$. This means that $t_P = t_C = 0$.\nThe coordinates for Event P in frame $S$ are $(x_P, t_P) = (L, 0)$.\n\nThe differences in the spacetime coordinates between the two events in frame $S$ are:\n$\\Delta x = x_P - x_C = L - 0 = L$\n$\\Delta t = t_P - t_C = 0 - 0 = 0$\n\nWe want to find the time interval between these two events as measured in the asteroids' rest frame, $S'$.
