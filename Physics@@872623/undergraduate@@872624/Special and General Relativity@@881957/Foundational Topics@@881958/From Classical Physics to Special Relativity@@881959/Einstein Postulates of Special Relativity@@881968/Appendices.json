The total proper time for the journey, measured in the spaceship's frame, is $\\Delta\\tau = 2.00$ years.\n\nOur first step is to determine the speed of the spaceship, $v$. Let $\\Delta t$ be the total time of the journey as measured in the Earth frame S. From the definition of velocity, we have:\n$$ \\Delta t = \\frac{L_0}{v} $$\nAccording to the principle of time dilation from special relativity, the time interval $\\Delta t$ in the Earth frame is related to the proper time interval $\\Delta\\tau$ in the spaceship's frame by:\n$$ \\Delta t = \\gamma \\Delta \\tau $$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nBy equating the two expressions for $\\Delta t$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{L_0}{v} = \\gamma \\Delta \\tau = \\frac{\\Delta \\tau}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}} $$\nTo solve for $v$, we square both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\frac{L_0^2}{v^2} = \\frac{(\\Delta \\tau)^2}{1 - (v/c)^2} $$\n$$ L_0^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right) = v^2 (\\Delta \\tau)^2 $$\n$$ L_0^2 - \\frac{L_0^2 v^2}{c^2} = v^2 (\\Delta \\tau)^2 $$\nRearranging the terms to solve for $v^2$:\n$$ L_0^2 = v^2 \\left((\\Delta \\tau)^2 + \\frac{L_0^2}{c^2}\\right) $$\n$$ v^2 = \\frac{L_0^2}{(\\Delta \\tau)^2 + (L_0/c)^2} $$\nTaking the square root gives the speed $v$:\n$$ v = \\frac{L_0}{\\sqrt{(\\Delta \\tau)^2 + (L_0/c)^2}} $$\nWe can also express this in terms of the dimensionless speed $\\beta = v/c$:\n$$ \\beta = \\frac{v}{c} = \\frac{L_0/c}{\\sqrt{(\\Delta \\tau)^2 + (L_0/c)^2}} $$\n\nThe problem states that the spaceship sends a signal back to Earth after a proper time of $\\Delta\\tau' = \\frac{\\Delta\\tau}{2} = 1.00$ year has elapsed. Let's call the event of sending this signal 'E'. We need to find the time $t_1$ and position $x_1$ of event E in the Earth frame S.\nUsing the time dilation formula for this part of the journey:\n$$ t_1 = \\gamma \\Delta\\tau' $$\nWe can find $\\gamma$ from the total journey parameters.

The time it takes for this signal to reach Earth, $t_{\\text{signal}}$, is:\n$$ t_{\\text{signal}} = \\frac{x_1}{c} = \\frac{L_0/2}{c} = \\frac{L_0}{2c} $$\n\nThe total time elapsed on Earth's clocks, $T_{\\text{total}}$, from the spaceship's departure until the signal is received, is the sum of the time until the signal was emitted ($t_1$) and the signal's travel time ($t_{\\text{signal}}$):\n$$ T_{\\text{total}} = t_1 + t_{\\text{signal}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{(\\Delta \\tau)^2 + (L_0/c)^2}}{2} + \\frac{L_0}{2c} $$\nNow we can substitute the given values: $L_0 = 10.0$ light-years and $\\Delta\\tau = 2.00$ years.
