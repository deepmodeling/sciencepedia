We are interested in the thermal fluctuations of the total internal energy of the gas.\n\nWe will compare the system's behavior at two distinct temperatures. At a low temperature, $T_{low}$, the thermal energy is insufficient to excite the rotational modes, so only translational degrees of freedom contribute to the internal energy.

The formula is:\n$$(\\Delta E)^2 = \\langle E^2 \\rangle - \\langle E \\rangle^2 = k_B T^2 C_V$$\nwhere $\\langle E \\rangle$ is the average internal energy, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature.\n\nThe RMS energy fluctuation, $\\Delta E$, is the square root of this quantity:\n$$\\Delta E = \\sqrt{k_B T^2 C_V} = T \\sqrt{k_B C_V}$$\n\nWe need to calculate the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta E_{high}}{\\Delta E_{low}}$.

The heat capacity at constant volume is defined as $C_V = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\langle E \\rangle}{\\partial T}\\right)_V$. We can find the average energy $\\langle E \\rangle$ using the equipartition theorem. The theorem states that each quadratic degree of freedom contributes $\\frac{1}{2} k_B T$ to the average energy of a single particle.

A diatomic molecule, like any point mass, has 3 translational degrees of freedom (motion along x, y, and z axes). Therefore, the number of active degrees of freedom is $f_{low} = 3$.\nThe heat capacity at this temperature is:\n$$ C_{V, low} = \\frac{3}{2} N k_B $$\n\n**Case 2: High Temperature ($T_{high}$)**\nAt $T_{high} \\gg \\Theta_{rot}$ (but below the vibrational temperature), both translational and rotational modes are active. The molecule is described as \"rigid\". A rigid diatomic molecule has 3 translational degrees of freedom and 2 rotational degrees of freedom (rotation about two axes perpendicular to the bond axis; rotation about the bond axis is negligible).
