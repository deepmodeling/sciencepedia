Spin-0 implies total spin quantum number $S=0$ and hence spin multiplicity $2S+1=1$, i.e., there is only one spin state. By the spin-statistics connection, identical spin-0 particles are bosons, so the Pauli exclusion principle does not apply. Consequently, any number of these particles can occupy the same one-particle quantum state.\n\nAtomic orbitals are single-particle eigenstates labeled by $(n,\\ell,m)$ with energies ordered as $1s$ lowest, then $2s$, $2p$, etc. For a bosonic system of $N$ identical particles, the many-body ground state is obtained by placing as many particles as possible in the lowest single-particle energy state, because there is no exclusion constraint limiting occupancy.

This practice guides you through the derivation of degeneracy pressure, a quantum mechanical pressure that arises because fermions are forbidden from occupying the same state.
