This first exercise provides a concrete foundation by asking you to enumerate the possible arrangements for a simple two-particle, two-level system. By directly comparing distinguishable particles, identical bosons, and identical fermions, you will gain a hands-on understanding of how these statistical rules operate at the most basic level [@problem_id:1966075].", "problem": "Consider a simple quantum system consisting of two particles that are to be distributed among two distinct single-particle energy levels, labeled $\\epsilon_1$ and $\\epsilon_2$. Your task is to determine the total number of distinct microstates for this two-particle system under three different statistical assumptions. For the purpose of this problem, a microstate is defined by specifying which energy level each particle occupies, while respecting the rules of distinguishability and particle statistics. For the case of fermions, assume the particles have identical spin quantum numbers, meaning the Pauli exclusion principle applies directly to their occupation of the energy levels $\\epsilon_1$ and $\\epsilon_2$.\n\nCalculate the total number of distinct microstates for each of the following three independent cases:\n- (A) The two particles are distinguishable classical particles.\n- (B) The two particles are identical bosons.\n- (C) The two particles are identical fermions.\n\nLet the number of microstates for cases (A), (B), and (C) be $N_A$, $N_B$, and $N_C$, respectively.

With identical spin quantum numbers and only two distinct single-particle levels, each level can hold at most one fermion. Therefore, both particles must occupy different levels.
