This exercise provides a direct comparison of how this classification impacts the ground state of a simple system. By analyzing two identical but spinless particles in a harmonic oscillator, we can isolate the effects of the required wavefunction symmetry and see firsthand how the Pauli exclusion principle for fermions creates a drastically different ground state configuration compared to bosons [@problem_id:1994654].", "problem": "Consider a system of two identical, non-interacting, spinless particles of mass $m$ confined in a two-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential given by $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2)$.

The two-particle ground state is the symmetric product, which is unique because the single-particle ground state is non-degenerate. Hence $D_{B}=1$.\n\n- Fermions (spinless): By the Pauli principle, both cannot occupy $(0,0)$.
