One half contains $n$ moles of a monatomic ideal gas at an initial temperature $T_0$ and occupying a volume $V_0$. The other half is a perfect vacuum.

The entire system (gas and both chambers) is thermally isolated from the surroundings during this step. After this expansion, the gas occupies a total volume of $2V_0$.\n\nStep 2: The gas is then placed in thermal contact with a large heat reservoir, which remains at a constant temperature $T_0$.
