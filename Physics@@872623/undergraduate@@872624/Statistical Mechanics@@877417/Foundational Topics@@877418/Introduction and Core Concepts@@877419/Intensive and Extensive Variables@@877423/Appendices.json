Initially, both systems are in thermal equilibrium with each other at a temperature $T$ and pressure $P$. Each container has a volume $V$.\n\nThe physicist then removes the partition separating the two containers, allowing them to merge into a single larger system, called System C. This process is done in a way that no heat is exchanged with the surroundings and no work is done.

The system consists of two large, immiscible fluids (e.g., oil and water), which form a distinct interface between them.

This energy is given by the relation $G_{int} = \\gamma A$, where $A$ is the total area of the interface and $\\gamma$ is the interfacial tension.
