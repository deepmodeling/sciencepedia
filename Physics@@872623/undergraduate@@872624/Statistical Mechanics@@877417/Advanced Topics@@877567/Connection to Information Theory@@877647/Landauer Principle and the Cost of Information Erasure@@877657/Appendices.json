This practice challenges us to look beyond counting physical bits and to consider the actual uncertainty, or entropy, of a system.

[@problem_id:1975857]", "problem": "A specialized two-bit memory cell is a fundamental component of a hypothetical cryptographic device. Due to the device's architecture, the two bits in this cell are always anti-correlated; that is, if one bit is 0, the other must be 1, and vice versa. At the start of an operation, the cell is known to be in one of the two possible anti-correlated states, '01' or '10', with equal probability.\n\nTo prepare for the next cryptographic cycle, this memory cell must be reset to a standard ground state, defined as '00'. This reset procedure is performed quasi-statically and isothermally by placing the cell in contact with a large thermal reservoir maintained at a constant absolute temperature $T$.\n\nLet $k_B$ be the Boltzmann constant. Determine the absolute minimum amount of work that must be supplied to the memory cell to accomplish this reset. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $k_B$ and $T$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum work required to transform a system from a statistical mixture of initial states to a single final state in an isothermal process. This minimum work is dictated by the change in the system's entropy, a principle established by Rolf Landauer. The minimum work, $W_{min}$, that must be done on the system is related to the change in its statistical (Gibbs) entropy, $\\Delta S$, by the formula:\n$$W_{min} = -T \\Delta S$$\nwhere $T$ is the absolute temperature of the thermal reservoir. The change in entropy is $\\Delta S = S_{final} - S_{initial}$. We must calculate the initial and final entropies of the two-bit memory cell.\n\nFirst, let's determine the initial entropy, $S_{initial}$. The system is in one of two possible microstates ('01' or '10') with equal probability. The number of accessible microstates is $\\Omega_{initial} = 2$. For a system with $\\Omega$ equally probable microstates, the statistical entropy is given by the Boltzmann entropy formula:\n$$S = k_B \\ln(\\Omega)$$\nApplying this to our initial state:\n$$S_{initial} = k_B \\ln(\\Omega_{initial}) = k_B \\ln(2)$$\n\nNext, we determine the final entropy, $S_{final}$. The system is reset to the single, well-defined state '00'. In this case, there is only one possible microstate that the system can occupy. The number of accessible microstates in the final configuration is $\\Omega_{final} = 1$.\nThe entropy of this final state is therefore:\n$$S_{final} = k_B \\ln(\\Omega_{final}) = k_B \\ln(1) = 0$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in entropy of the system during the reset process:\n$$\\Delta S = S_{final} - S_{initial} = 0 - k_B \\ln(2) = -k_B \\ln(2)$$\n\nFinally, we substitute this change in entropy into the formula for the minimum work done on the system.\n$$W_{min} = -T \\Delta S = -T(-k_B \\ln(2))$$\n$$W_{min} = k_B T \\ln(2)$$\n\nThis result is the minimum work required to erase the one bit of information contained in the correlated two-bit system. Although the system has two physical bits, the strong anti-correlation reduces its initial state space from four possibilities ('00', '01', '10', '11') to just two, meaning it only holds one bit of uncertainty ($log_2(2)=1$) which is erased during the reset.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{k_B T \\ln(2)}$$", "id": "1975857"}, {"introduction": "Perfect erasure, where a random bit is reset to a definite state, represents an idealized limit. This final practice explores the more realistic scenario of a faulty operation, where the final state still contains some uncertainty. By calculating the heat dissipated by an unreliable memory cell, you will uncover a deeper aspect of Landauer's principle: the thermodynamic cost is precisely coupled to the amount of information gained, or entropy reduced, during the process.

To prepare the cell for a new computation, an \"erase\" operation is performed. This operation is intended to reset the bit to the '0' state, regardless of its initial state. The initial state of the bit before erasure is completely random, meaning it has an equal probability of being '0' or '1'.\n\nHowever, due to quantum tunneling effects, the erasure process is not perfectly reliable. When the operation is applied, the bit is set to the '0' state with a probability $p$ and, due to an error, is set to the '1' state with a probability $1-p$. The entire process occurs while the memory cell is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings at a constant absolute temperature $T$.\n\nAssuming the erasure is performed in a thermodynamically reversible manner, derive an expression for the minimum energy dissipated as heat to the environment during this faulty erasure of a single bit.
