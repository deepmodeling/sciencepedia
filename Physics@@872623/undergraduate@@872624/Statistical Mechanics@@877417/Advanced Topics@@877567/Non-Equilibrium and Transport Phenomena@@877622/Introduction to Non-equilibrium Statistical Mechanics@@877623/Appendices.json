To build an intuition for this, we can model the process as a \"random walk\" on a lattice, a foundational concept in the study of stochastic processes. This exercise explores a simple yet powerful discrete model, allowing you to calculate the probability of a particle returning to its starting point after a set number of steps.

The particle representing the defect starts at the origin, $(0,0)$. At each discrete time step, the particle jumps to one of its four nearest-neighbor sites.\n\nThe crystal's anisotropy affects the jump probabilities. The total probability of taking a step along the horizontal axis (either in the $+x$ or $-x$ direction) is given by $p_x$. The total probability of taking a step along the vertical axis (either in the $+y$ or $-y$ direction) is given by $p_y$. These probabilities are constrained by the condition $p_x + p_y = 1$, with $0 \\le p_x \\le 1$.\n\nFor any chosen axis, the jump direction is unbiased. This means the probability of jumping in the $+x$ direction is $p_x/2$, and the probability of jumping in the $-x$ direction is also $p_x/2$. Similarly, the probabilities for jumping in the $+y$ and $-y$ directions are each $p_y/2$.\n\nCalculate the total probability that the particle is found back at the origin after exactly four time steps.

Over four independent steps, the probability of any specific sequence is the product of the step probabilities. To return to the origin after exactly four steps, the net displacement along both $x$ and $y$ must be zero. Therefore the number of $x$-axis steps must be even with equal counts of $+x$ and $-x$, and similarly for $y$.\n\nWe partition by the number $k$ of $x$-steps among the four steps.\n\nCase $k=0$: All four steps are along $y$, with two $+y$ and two $-y$.
