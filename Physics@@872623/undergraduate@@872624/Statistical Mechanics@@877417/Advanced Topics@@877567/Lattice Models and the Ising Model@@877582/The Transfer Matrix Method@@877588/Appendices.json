The beads are available in $q$ distinct colors. To ensure a visually varied pattern, there is a stringent rule: no two adjacent beads in the chain can have the same color.\n\nIn statistical mechanics, this system can be modeled as a one-dimensional lattice where each site represents a bead. The state of site $i$, denoted by $s_i$, corresponds to its color, with $s_i$ taking an integer value from $1$ to $q$. The interaction between an adjacent pair of beads is described by a transfer matrix $T$. The element $T_{ab}$ of this $q \\times q$ matrix quantifies the interaction between a bead of color $a$ and an adjacent bead of color $b$. Specifically, $T_{ab} = 1$ if the configuration of the adjacent pair $(a, b)$ is allowed (i.e., $a \\neq b$), and $T_{ab} = 0$ if it is forbidden (i.e., $a = b$).\n\nConsider a system where the number of available colors is $q=5$.
