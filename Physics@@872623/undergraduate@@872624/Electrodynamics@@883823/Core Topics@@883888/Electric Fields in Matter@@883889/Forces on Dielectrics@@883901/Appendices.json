A rigid dielectric slab, with a dielectric constant $\\kappa  1$ and dimensions identical to the space between the plates ($L \\times L \\times d$), is partially inserted into the capacitor. Let $x$ denote the length of the slab that is inside the capacitor, measured parallel to one of the plate edges, such that $0 \\le x \\le L$. The remaining volume between the plates is a vacuum, with permittivity $\\epsilon_0$. An external agent applies a force to control the slab's position. Let $F(x)$ be the magnitude of this external force required to hold the slab in static equilibrium against the capacitor's attractive pull. Calculate the ratio $\\frac{F(x \\to 0)}{F(x \\to L)}$, which is the ratio of the force required just as the slab begins to enter to the force required when it is almost fully inserted. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $\\kappa$.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the electrostatic force acting on the dielectric slab as a function of its insertion depth, $x$. The magnitude of the external force required to hold the slab in equilibrium, $F(x)$, will be equal to the magnitude of this electrostatic force. The electrostatic force can be derived from the potential energy of the system, $U$, using the relation $F_e = -\\frac{dU}{dx}$. The force $F_e$ points in the direction that lowers the system's potential energy. We are interested in its magnitude, so $F(x) = \\left| -\\frac{dU}{dx} \\right|$.\n\nThe capacitor is electrically isolated, so the total charge $Q$ on the plates is constant. The potential energy stored in a capacitor with constant charge is given by $U = \\frac{Q^2}{2C}$, where $C$ is the total capacitance of the system. Our first task is to determine the total capacitance $C$ as a function of $x$.\n\nThe system can be modeled as two capacitors connected in parallel. One capacitor, $C_1$, corresponds to the section filled with the dielectric, and the other, $C_2$, corresponds to the vacuum section.\n\nFor the section with the dielectric, the area of the plates is $A_1 = L \\times x$. The capacitance is:\n$$C_1 = \\frac{\\kappa \\epsilon_0 A_1}{d} = \\frac{\\kappa \\epsilon_0 L x}{d}$$\n\nFor the vacuum section, the area of the plates is $A_2 = L \\times (L-x)$. The capacitance is:\n$$C_2 = \\frac{\\epsilon_0 A_2}{d} = \\frac{\\epsilon_0 L (L-x)}{d}$$\n\nSince these two conceptual capacitors are in parallel (they share the same potential difference), the total capacitance $C(x)$ is the sum of their individual capacitances:\n$$C(x) = C_1 + C_2 = \\frac{\\kappa \\epsilon_0 L x}{d} + \\frac{\\epsilon_0 L (L-x)}{d}$$\nFactoring out common terms, we get:\n$$C(x) = \\frac{\\epsilon_0 L}{d} (\\kappa x + L - x) = \\frac{\\epsilon_0 L}{d} [L + (\\kappa-1)x]$$\n\nNow we can write the potential energy $U(x)$ of the system:\n$$U(x) = \\frac{Q^2}{2C(x)} = \\frac{Q^2}{2 \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon_0 L}{d} [L + (\\kappa-1)x] \\right)} = \\frac{Q^2 d}{2 \\epsilon_0 L} [L + (\\kappa-1)x]^{-1}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the magnitude of the electrostatic force by taking the negative derivative of the potential energy with respect to $x$.\n$$F_e(x) = -\\frac{dU}{dx} = -\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{Q^2 d}{2 \\epsilon_0 L} [L + (\\kappa-1)x]^{-1} \\right)$$\nThe prefactor $\\frac{Q^2 d}{2 \\epsilon_0 L}$ is constant with respect to $x$. Using the chain rule for differentiation:\n$$F_e(x) = -\\left( \\frac{Q^2 d}{2 \\epsilon_0 L} \\right) \\left( -1 \\cdot [L + (\\kappa-1)x]^{-2} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}[L + (\\kappa-1)x] \\right)$$\nThe derivative of the inner term is $\\frac{d}{dx}[L + (\\kappa-1)x] = \\kappa-1$.\n$$F_e(x) = -\\left( \\frac{Q^2 d}{2 \\epsilon_0 L} \\right) \\left( -[L + (\\kappa-1)x]^{-2} (\\kappa-1) \\right)$$\n$$F_e(x) = \\frac{Q^2 d (\\kappa-1)}{2 \\epsilon_0 L [L + (\\kappa-1)x]^2}$$\nThe magnitude of the external force is $F(x) = |F_e(x)|$. Since $\\kappa  1$, the expression is positive, so $F(x) = F_e(x)$.
