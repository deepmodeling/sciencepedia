By the right-hand rule, the magnetic field produced by this current will be in the $y$-direction. Above the sheet ($z0$), the field will point in the $-\\hat{y}$ direction, and below the sheet ($z0$), it will point in the $+\\hat{y}$ direction. Due to the infinite extent of the sheet, the magnitude of the field will be uniform in any plane parallel to the sheet. Therefore, we can write the $\\vec{H}$ field as:\n    $\\vec{H} = H_1 \\hat{y}$ for $z0$ (Region 1: vacuum)\n    $\\vec{H} = H_2 \\hat{y}$ for $z0$ (Region 2: magnetic material)\n    where $H_1$ and $H_2$ are constants. Based on the right-hand rule, we expect $H_1  0$ and $H_2  0$.\n\n2.  **Ampere's Law for $\\vec{H}$**:\n    We apply Ampere's law in its integral form for the auxiliary field $\\vec{H}$:\n    $$ \\oint \\vec{H} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = I_{f, \\text{enc}} $$\n    where $I_{f, \\text{enc}}$ is the total free current enclosed by the Amperian loop.
