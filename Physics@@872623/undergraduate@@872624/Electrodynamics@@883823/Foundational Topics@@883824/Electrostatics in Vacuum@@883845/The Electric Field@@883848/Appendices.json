Determine the coordinate $x$ along the axis where the net electric field is zero. Express your answer as a function of $d$.", "solution": "The total electric field at any point on the x-axis is the vector sum of the electric fields produced by each charge individually, according to the principle of superposition. Let $\\vec{E}_1$ be the electric field from charge $Q_1=+q$ and $\\vec{E}_2$ be the electric field from charge $Q_2=-9q$. We are looking for a position $x$ where the net electric field $\\vec{E}_{\\text{net}} = \\vec{E}_1 + \\vec{E}_2 = \\vec{0}$. This condition implies that $\\vec{E}_1 = -\\vec{E}_2$, which means the two electric fields must have equal magnitude and opposite directions.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field from a point charge $Q$ at a distance $r$ is given by $E = \\frac{k|Q|}{r^2}$, where $k$ is Coulomb's constant. The direction of the field is radially outward from a positive charge and radially inward toward a negative charge.\n\nLet's analyze the three possible regions along the x-axis:\n\n1.  **Region 1: Between the charges ($0  x  d$)**\n    In this region, the electric field $\\vec{E}_1$ from the positive charge $+q$ at the origin points to the right (positive x-direction). The electric field $\\vec{E}_2$ from the negative charge $-9q$ at $x=d$ also points to the right (as it points towards the negative charge). Since both field vectors point in the same direction, their sum cannot be zero. Therefore, there is no solution in this region.\n\n2.  **Region 2: To the right of the charges ($x  d$)**\n    In this region, the electric field $\\vec{E}_1$ from $+q$ points to the right. The electric field $\\vec{E}_2$ from $-9q$ points to the left. The directions are opposite, so cancellation is possible. However, for the magnitudes to be equal, the point must be closer to the charge with the smaller magnitude. The magnitudes of the charges are $|Q_1|=q$ and $|Q_2|=9q$. In the region $x  d$, any point is closer to the larger magnitude charge $Q_2$ (distance is $x-d$) than to the smaller magnitude charge $Q_1$ (distance is $x$). Since the field is stronger closer to a charge and also stronger for a larger charge, the magnitude of $\\vec{E}_2$ will always be greater than the magnitude of $\\vec{E}_1$ in this region. Thus, they cannot cancel. No solution exists here.\n\n3.  **Region 3: To the left of the charges ($x  0$)**\n    In this region, the electric field $\\vec{E}_1$ from $+q$ points to the left (negative x-direction). The electric field $\\vec{E}_2$ from $-9q$ points to the right (positive x-direction). Since the fields are in opposite directions, their magnitudes can be set equal to find a point of zero net field.\n    The distance from the point $x$ to $Q_1$ is $r_1 = |x-0| = |x|$. Since $x0$, $r_1 = -x$.\n    The distance from the point $x$ to $Q_2$ is $r_2 = |x-d|$. Since $x0$ and $d0$, $x-d$ is negative, so $r_2 = -(x-d) = d-x$.\n\n    Now, we set the magnitudes of the electric fields equal:\n    $$E_1 = E_2$$\n    $$\\frac{k|Q_1|}{r_1^2} = \\frac{k|Q_2|}{r_2^2}$$\n    $$\\frac{k q}{(-x)^2} = \\frac{k (9q)}{(d-x)^2}$$\n    We can cancel $k$ and $q$ from both sides (assuming $q \\neq 0$):\n    $$\\frac{1}{x^2} = \\frac{9}{(d-x)^2}$$\n    Taking the square root of both sides gives:\n    $$\\frac{1}{|x|} = \\frac{3}{|d-x|}$$\n    Using our definitions for distances in this region ($|x| = -x$ and $|d-x| = d-x$):\n    $$\\frac{1}{-x} = \\frac{3}{d-x}$$\n    Now, we solve for $x$:\n    $$d-x = 3(-x)$$\n    $$d-x = -3x$$\n    $$d = -2x$$\n    $$x = -\\frac{d}{2}$$\n    This position is in the region $x  0$, so it is a valid physical solution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{d}{2}}$$", "id": "1613461"}, {"introduction": "While direct integration works for any charge distribution, Gauss's Law provides a much more elegant and efficient method for calculating the electric field in situations with high degrees of symmetry.
