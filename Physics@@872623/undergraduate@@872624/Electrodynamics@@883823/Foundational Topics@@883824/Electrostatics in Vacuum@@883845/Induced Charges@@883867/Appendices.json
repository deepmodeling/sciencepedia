Because the electrostatic field inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is zero, Gauss's law implies that the net charge enclosed by such a Gaussian surface is zero. Therefore, the charge $+q$ inside the cavity induces a charge $-q$ on the inner surface and a charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the shell so that the conductor remains neutral and the field in the conductor vanishes.\n\nConsider now the region outside the shell, $rR_{2}$. The total charge enclosed by any spherical Gaussian surface of radius $rR_{2}$ is\n$$\nq_{\\text{enc}}=q+(-q)+(+q)=q,\n$$\nso the total enclosed charge is $q$. The potential $V$ in the charge-free exterior region satisfies Laplace's equation and the boundary at $r=R_{2}$ is an equipotential sphere (the conductor is an equipotential).
