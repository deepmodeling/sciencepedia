The first plate lies on the $xz$-plane for all $x \\geq 0$, and the second plate lies on the $yz$-plane for all $y \\geq 0$. These two plates meet at a right angle along the $z$-axis. A single point charge of magnitude $+q$ is placed at the coordinates $(a, b, 0)$, where both $a$ and $b$ are positive constants.\n\nTo determine the electrostatic potential in the region defined by $x > 0$ and $y > 0$, one can use an arrangement of fictitious \"image charges\" placed in the other three quadrants.

A charge $+q$ at $(-a, -b, 0)$ only.", "solution": "The problem requires us to find a set of image charges that, along with the original charge $+q$ at $(a, b, 0)$, make the electrostatic potential $V$ equal to zero on the grounded conducting planes. The planes are at $y=0$ for $x>0$ and at $x=0$ for $y>0$. The potential at a point $\\vec{r}$ due to a system of charges $q_i$ at positions $\\vec{r_i}$ is given by $V(\\vec{r}) = \\sum_i \\frac{k q_i}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r_i}|}$, where $k = 1/(4\\pi\\epsilon_0)$. For the potential to be zero on a boundary plane, the contributions from all charges must sum to zero everywhere on that plane.\n\nLet's build the system of image charges step-by-step. The original charge is $+q$ at $(a, b, 0)$.\n\nStep 1: Satisfy the boundary condition on the $y=0$ plane.\nTo make the potential zero on the plane $y=0$, we must place an image charge that cancels the potential from the original charge $+q$. For any point $(x, 0, z)$ on this plane, its distance to the original charge at $(a,b,0)$ is $\\sqrt{(x-a)^2 + b^2 + z^2}$. An image charge of magnitude $-q$ placed at the reflected position $(a, -b, 0)$ will have a distance of $\\sqrt{(x-a)^2 + (-b)^2 + z^2}$ to the same point. Since the magnitudes of the distances are equal and the charges have opposite signs, their potentials will cancel each other out on the entire $y=0$ plane.\nSo, our first image charge, $q_1$, is $-q$ at position $(a, -b, 0)$.\n\nStep 2: Satisfy the boundary condition on the $x=0$ plane.\nSimilarly, to make the potential zero on the plane $x=0$, we must place an image charge that cancels the potential from the original charge $+q$. For any point $(0, y, z)$ on this plane, its distance to the charge $+q$ at $(a,b,0)$ is $\\sqrt{a^2 + (y-b)^2 + z^2}$. An image charge of magnitude $-q$ placed at the reflected position $(-a, b, 0)$ will have a distance of $\\sqrt{(-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + z^2}$ to the same point. The potentials will cancel.\nSo, our second image charge, $q_2$, is $-q$ at position $(-a, b, 0)$.\n\nStep 3: Address the interaction between image charges and the opposing planes.\nAt this point, we have the original charge $+q$ at $(a,b,0)$ and two image charges: $q_1 = -q$ at $(a, -b, 0)$ and $q_2 = -q$ at $(-a, b, 0)$.\nLet's check the boundary conditions again.\nThe pair $(+q$ at $(a, b, 0)$, $q_1$ at $(a, -b, 0))$ ensures $V=0$ on the $y=0$ plane.\nThe pair $(+q$ at $(a, b, 0)$, $q_2$ at $(-a, b, 0))$ ensures $V=0$ on the $x=0$ plane.\nHowever, the charge $q_1$ will create a non-zero potential on the $x=0$ plane, and the charge $q_2$ will create a non-zero potential on the $y=0$ plane. The boundary conditions are not yet fully satisfied.\n\nStep 4: Introduce a third image charge to fix the remaining potential imbalance.\nWe need to cancel the potential produced by $q_1$ on the $x=0$ plane. We can do this by placing an image of $q_1$ across the $x=0$ plane. The charge $q_1$ has magnitude $-q$ and is located at $(a, -b, 0)$. Its reflection across the $x=0$ plane will be at $(-a, -b, 0)$, and its magnitude will be the negative of $q_1$, which is $-(-q) = +q$.\nSo, let's introduce a third image charge, $q_3 = +q$, at position $(-a, -b, 0)$.\n\nStep 5: Verify that this new arrangement satisfies all conditions.\nThe full system of charges is now:\n- Original charge: $+q$ at $(a, b, 0)$\n- Image charge 1: $q_1 = -q$ at $(a, -b, 0)$\n- Image charge 2: $q_2 = -q$ at $(-a, b, 0)$\n- Image charge 3: $q_3 = +q$ at $(-a, -b, 0)$\n\nLet's check the potential on the boundary plane $y=0$.\n- The pair $(+q, q_1)$ gives zero potential on $y=0$.\n- The pair $(q_2, q_3)$ must also give zero potential on $y=0$. $q_2$ is at $(-a, b, 0)$ and $q_3$ is at $(-a, -b, 0)$ with charge $-q_2$. This is a standard image charge pair with respect to the $y=0$ plane, so their combined potential is zero on this plane.\nThus, the total potential is zero on the $y=0$ plane.\n\nNow let's check the potential on the boundary plane $x=0$.\n- The pair $(+q, q_2)$ gives zero potential on $x=0$.\n- The pair $(q_1, q_3)$ must also give zero potential on $x=0$. $q_1$ is at $(a, -b, 0)$ and $q_3$ is at $(-a, -b, 0)$ with charge $-q_1$. This is a standard image charge pair with respect to the $x=0$ plane, so their combined potential is zero on this plane.\nThus, the total potential is zero on the $x=0$ plane.\n\nBoth boundary conditions are satisfied. The required set of image charges is:\n1.  A charge $-q$ at $(a, -b, 0)$.\n2.  A charge $-q$ at $(-a, b, 0)$.\n3.  A charge $+q$ at $(-a, -b, 0)$.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1587727"}, {"introduction": "When boundary conditions are not simple constants, the powerful method of separation of variables becomes essential.
