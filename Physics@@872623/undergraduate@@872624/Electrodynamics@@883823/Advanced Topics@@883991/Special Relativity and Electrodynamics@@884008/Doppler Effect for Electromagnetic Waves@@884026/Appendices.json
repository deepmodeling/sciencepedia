This problem [@problem_id:1575356] is an excellent exercise in problem-solving, as it requires you to decompose the process into two distinct steps: first, the frequency shift observed by the moving mirror, and second, the shift of the re-emitted light as observed by the original source. This two-step application of the Doppler formula is fundamental to understanding technologies like police radar and has important applications in astrophysics.", "problem": "An interstellar probe equipped with a large, perfectly reflecting light sail is traveling directly towards its home base station at a constant relativistic speed $v$. To monitor the probe's velocity, the base station emits a monochromatic laser pulse with a frequency $f_0$, as measured in the station's rest frame. This pulse travels towards the probe, reflects off the sail along the incident path, and travels back to the base station where its frequency is measured.\n\nAssuming the light sail acts as a perfect mirror and the motion is entirely along the line connecting the station and the probe, derive an expression for the frequency of the reflected pulse, $f_{final}$, as detected by the base station. Your answer should be expressed in terms of the initial frequency $f_0$, the probe's speed $v$, and the speed of light $c$.", "solution": "The problem can be solved by applying the relativistic Doppler effect formula twice. First, for the light traveling from the station to the probe, and second, for the light reflecting from the probe back to the station.\n\nLet S be the rest frame of the base station and S' be the rest frame of the probe. The probe moves with speed $v$ towards the station.\n\n**Step 1: Frequency measured by the probe**\n\nThe light pulse is emitted from the station (source) with frequency $f_0$ in frame S. The probe (observer) is moving towards this source with speed $v$. The frequency $f'$ measured by an observer on the probe (in frame S') is given by the relativistic Doppler effect formula for an observer approaching a stationary source:\n$$f' = f_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{c+v}{c-v}}$$\nAlternatively, this can be written in terms of the ratio $\\beta = v/c$:\n$$f' = f_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta}}$$\nThis increase in frequency is a blueshift because the observer is moving towards the source.\n\n**Step 2: Reflection in the probe's frame**\n\nIn the probe's own rest frame, S', the sail is a stationary, perfect mirror. When light reflects off a stationary mirror, its frequency does not change. Therefore, the frequency of the reflected light pulse in the probe's frame S' is also $f'$.\n\n**Step 3: Frequency measured by the station**\n\nThe reflected light pulse now travels back towards the base station. For this leg of the journey, the probe's sail acts as the source of the light, and the base station is the observer. The source (the probe) is moving towards the observer (the station) with speed $v$. The frequency of the light in the source's rest frame (S') is $f'$.\n\nWe can now find the final frequency, $f_{final}$, measured by the observer at the station (in frame S) using the relativistic Doppler effect formula for a source approaching a stationary observer:\n$$f_{final} = f' \\sqrt{\\frac{c+v}{c-v}}$$\nAgain, in terms of $\\beta = v/c$:\n$$f_{final} = f' \\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta}}$$\n\n**Step 4: Combine results to find the final expression**\n\nTo find the final frequency in terms of the initial frequency $f_0$, we substitute the expression for $f'$ from Step 1 into the equation from Step 3:\n$$f_{final} = \\left( f_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{c+v}{c-v}} \\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{c+v}{c-v}}$$\n$$f_{final} = f_0 \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{c+v}{c-v}} \\right)^2$$\n$$f_{final} = f_0 \\frac{c+v}{c-v}$$\n\nThis is the final expression for the frequency of the reflected pulse as detected by the base station.
