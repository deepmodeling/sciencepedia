The beam is at its narrowest point, the \"beam waist,\" at the coordinate $z=0$. A key characteristic of such a beam is that its wavefronts are not perfectly flat but are curved. The radius of curvature of these wavefronts, $R(z)$, varies with the distance $z$ from the waist. For a beam propagating in the positive z-direction ($z>0$), this radius of curvature is given by the expression:\n$$R(z) = z \\left[ 1 + \\left( \\frac{z_R}{z} \\right)^2 \\right]$$\nwhere $z_R$ is a positive constant known as the Rayleigh range, which characterizes the length over which the beam remains reasonably well-collimated.\n\nTo interface this beam with another optical component, it is necessary to place the component at the position along the z-axis where the beam's wavefront is most sharply curved. This location corresponds to the point where the radius of curvature $R(z)$ is at its minimum value.\n\nFind the distance $z$ from the beam waist where this minimum radius of curvature occurs.
