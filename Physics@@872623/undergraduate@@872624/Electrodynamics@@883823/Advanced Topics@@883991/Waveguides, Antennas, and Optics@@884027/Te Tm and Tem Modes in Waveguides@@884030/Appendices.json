Mastering this calculation is the first step toward understanding and designing functional waveguide systems. [@problem_id:1608372]", "problem": "In the design of modern high-frequency circuits, such as those found on a Printed Circuit Board (PCB), microstrip lines and other structures can often be modeled as a parallel-plate waveguide. Consider such a waveguide formed by two large, parallel, perfectly conducting plates separated by a distance $d$. The space between the plates is completely filled with a non-magnetic, lossless dielectric material. This material has a relative permittivity $\\epsilon_r$ and a relative permeability $\\mu_r$.\n\nFor this waveguide, the fundamental mode of propagation is the Transverse Electro-Magnetic (TEM) mode, which can propagate at any frequency. However, at sufficiently high frequencies, other modes can also begin to propagate. The first of these higher-order modes to appear is the Transverse Electric mode of order one, the $TE_1$ mode. The onset of this mode is undesirable as it can lead to signal distortion and interference.\n\nGiven the following parameters:\n- Plate separation, $d = 0.750 \\text{ mm}$\n- Relative permittivity of the dielectric, $\\epsilon_r = 2.25$\n- Relative permeability of the dielectric, $\\mu_r = 1.00$\n- The speed of light in vacuum, $c = 2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n\nCalculate the cutoff frequency for the $TE_1$ mode.
