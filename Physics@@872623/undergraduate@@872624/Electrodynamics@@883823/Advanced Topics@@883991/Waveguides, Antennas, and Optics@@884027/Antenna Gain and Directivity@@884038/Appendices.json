It is situated on a large, perfectly flat plane representing the ground. The antenna is engineered to radiate all of its power upwards, into the hemisphere above the ground, with no power radiated downwards. In a simplified model, its radiation intensity, denoted by $U$, is assumed to be perfectly uniform for all directions in the upper hemisphere and zero for all directions in the lower hemisphere.\n\nLet us use a standard spherical coordinate system $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$, where the origin is at the antenna, the xy-plane represents the ground, and the z-axis points towards the zenith (straight up). The polar angle $\\theta$ is measured from the zenith, so $\\theta=0$ is directly overhead and $\\theta=\\pi/2$ is the horizon.
