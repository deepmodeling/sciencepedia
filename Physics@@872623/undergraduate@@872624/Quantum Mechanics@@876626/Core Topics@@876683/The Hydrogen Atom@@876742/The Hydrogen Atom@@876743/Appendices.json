By discretizing the Hamiltonian and finding the eigenvalues of the resulting matrix, you will gain hands-on experience with the powerful techniques used in modern computational physics and chemistry [@problem_id:2432918].", "problem": "You are asked to implement a computational solution to the radial eigenvalue problem for the hydrogen atom by discretizing the radial Hamiltonian on a uniform grid and computing its lowest eigenvalue using a matrix solver. The starting point must be the time-independent Schrödinger equation in atomic units (atomic units (a.u.) mean $\\hbar=1$, $m_{\\mathrm e}=1$, $e=1$, and $4\\pi\\varepsilon_0=1$), for a point Coulomb potential $V(r)=-1/r$. Upon separation of variables, the radial part reduces to an effective one-dimensional eigenvalue problem for the reduced radial function $u_\\ell(r)$ on the half-line $r\\in[0,\\infty)$ with physically appropriate boundary conditions. In these units, energies are in Hartree, distances are in Bohr radii, and the exact ground state energy is $E_1=-1/2$ Hartree.\n\nYour tasks are:\n- Starting from the time-independent Schrödinger equation and separation of variables in spherical coordinates, formulate the effective one-dimensional eigenvalue problem for the reduced radial function $u_\\ell(r)$ with angular momentum quantum number $\\ell$, including appropriate boundary conditions at $r=0$ and as $r\\to\\infty$.\n- Specialize to the $s$-wave sector $\\ell=0$ and place the problem on a finite interval $[0,R_{\\max}]$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions at both ends. Argue why this is a consistent finite-domain approximation to the half-line problem.\n- Discretize the resulting boundary value problem on a uniform grid of $N$ points on $[0,R_{\\max}]$ using a standard second-order central difference approximation for the radial second derivative operator and form the corresponding real symmetric tridiagonal matrix that represents the Hamiltonian.\n- Compute the smallest eigenvalue of this tridiagonal matrix, which approximates the ground state energy. Use a solver suitable for tridiagonal Hermitian matrices.\n- Investigate the convergence of the ground state energy as a function of the grid size $N$ at fixed $R_{\\max}$.\n\nImplementation requirements:\n- Use only atomic units; report all energies in Hartree.\n- Use a uniform grid with $N$ points on $[0,R_{\\max}]$, grid spacing $\\Delta r = R_{\\max}/(N-1)$, interior unknowns at $r_j=j\\,\\Delta r$ for $j=1,2,\\dots,N-2$, and impose homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions at $r=0$ and $r=R_{\\max}$ on $u(r)$.\n- Use the $s$-wave sector $\\ell=0$ only.\n- Use a numerically stable and efficient Hermitian tridiagonal eigenvalue routine to compute only the lowest eigenvalue.\n- For each case, output the computed ground state energy and its absolute error relative to the exact value $-1/2$.\n\nTest suite:\n- Fix $R_{\\max}=30$ (in Bohr radii).\n- Compute the ground state energy for the following grid sizes $N$: $50$, $100$, $200$, $400$, $800$, $1600$.\n- For each $(R_{\\max},N)$ pair, the expected answer is a two-element list of floats $[E_0,\\lvert E_0-(-1/2)\\rvert]$, where $E_0$ is the computed ground state energy (in Hartree).

It represents a standard exercise in computational quantum mechanics.\n\nThe starting point is the time-independent Schrödinger equation (TISE) for a single electron in the central Coulomb potential of a proton. In atomic units, where the reduced mass of the electron-proton system is approximated by the electron mass $m_e=1$, and other constants are $\\hbar=1$, $e=1$, $4\\pi\\varepsilon_0=1$, the TISE is given by:\n$$\n\\left( -\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2 - \\frac{1}{r} \\right) \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) = E \\Psi(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nwhere $V(r) = -1/r$ is the Coulomb potential. Given the spherical symmetry of the potential, we seek solutions in spherical coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$ by separating variables. The wavefunction is written as $\\Psi(r, \\theta, \\phi) = R_{\\ell}(r) Y_{\\ell m}(\\theta, \\phi)$, where $Y_{\\ell m}$ are the spherical harmonics, eigenfunctions of the angular momentum operator. This separation leads to the radial Schrödinger equation for the radial part of the wavefunction $R_{\\ell}(r)$. It is numerically advantageous to work with the reduced radial function, defined as $u_\\ell(r) = r R_\\ell(r)$. Substituting this into the radial equation yields the effective one-dimensional eigenvalue problem for $u_\\ell(r)$:\n$$\n\\left[ -\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d^2}{dr^2} + V_{\\text{eff}}(r) \\right] u_\\ell(r) = E u_\\ell(r)\n$$\nwhere the effective potential is $V_{\\text{eff}}(r) = \\frac{\\ell(\\ell+1)}{2r^2} - \\frac{1}{r}$. The term $\\frac{\\ell(\\ell+1)}{2r^2}$ is the centrifugal potential barrier, with $\\ell$ being the angular momentum quantum number.\n\nThe problem requires a solution on the half-line $r \\in [0, \\infty)$. Physical boundary conditions must be imposed. First, the full wavefunction $\\Psi$ must be finite everywhere, including the origin $r=0$. Since $R_\\ell(r) = u_\\ell(r)/r$, for $R_\\ell(r)$ to be finite as $r \\to 0$, we must have $u_\\ell(0) = 0$. Second, for a bound state solution, the wavefunction must be normalizable, which means $\\int |\\Psi|^2 dV < \\infty$. This implies that the wavefunction must vanish at infinity, leading to the condition $u_\\ell(r) \\to 0$ as $r \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe problem specializes to the $s$-wave sector, which corresponds to the lowest angular momentum state with $\\ell=0$. In this case, the centrifugal term vanishes, and the radial equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\left[ -\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d^2}{dr^2} - \\frac{1}{r} \\right] u_0(r) = E u_0(r)\n$$\nTo solve this numerically, we must work on a finite domain. We replace the infinite interval $[0, \\infty)$ with a finite one $[0, R_{\\max}]$. The boundary condition at infinity is approximated by imposing $u_0(R_{\\max}) = 0$. This is a consistent approximation because for bound states, the wavefunction decays exponentially. For the ground state of hydrogen, $u_0(r)$ is proportional to $r e^{-r}$. If $R_{\\max}$ is chosen sufficiently large, the true wavefunction at $r=R_{\\max}$ is already negligible. For the specified $R_{\\max}=30$ Bohr radii, the value of the true ground state wavefunction is exceedingly small, on the order of $10^{-12}$, justifying the approximation $u_0(30) \\approx 0$.\n\nWe now discretize the differential equation on the interval $[0, R_{\\max}]$ using a uniform grid of $N$ points. The grid points are $r_j = j \\Delta r$ for $j = 0, 1, \\dots, N-1$, with grid spacing $\\Delta r = R_{\\max} / (N-1)$. The function $u_0(r)$ is represented by its values at these points, $u_j = u_0(r_j)$. The boundary conditions fix $u_0=0$ and $u_{N-1}=0$. The remaining $N-2$ values, $u_1, u_2, \\dots, u_{N-2}$, are the unknowns. The second derivative operator is approximated using a second-order central difference formula at each interior grid point $r_j$ ($j=1, \\dots, N-2$):\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 u_0}{dr^2} \\bigg|_{r=r_j} \\approx \\frac{u_{j+1} - 2u_j + u_{j-1}}{(\\Delta r)^2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the $s$-wave radial equation gives a system of linear equations:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{u_{j+1} - 2u_j + u_{j-1}}{(\\Delta r)^2} \\right) - \\frac{1}{r_j} u_j = E u_j, \\quad \\text{for } j=1, \\dots, N-2.\n$$\nRearranging the terms to fit the standard eigenvalue problem form $H \\mathbf{u} = E \\mathbf{u}$:\n$$\n\\left[ -\\frac{1}{2(\\Delta r)^2} \\right] u_{j-1} + \\left[ \\frac{1}{(\\Delta r)^2} - \\frac{1}{r_j} \\right] u_j + \\left[ -\\frac{1}{2(\\Delta r)^2} \\right] u_{j+1} = E u_j\n$$\nThis defines an $(N-2) \\times (N-2)$ matrix eigenvalue problem, where the vector of unknowns is $\\mathbf{u} = (u_1, u_2, \\dots, u_{N-2})^T$. The Hamiltonian matrix $H$ is real, symmetric, and tridiagonal. Its elements are:\n-   Diagonal elements: $H_{k,k} = \\frac{1}{(\\Delta r)^2} - \\frac{1}{r_{k+1}}$ for $k=0, \\dots, N-3$.\n-   Off-diagonal elements: $H_{k, k+1} = H_{k+1, k} = -\\frac{1}{2(\\Delta r)^2}$ for $k=0, \\dots, N-4$.\nHere, the matrix indices $k$ run from $0$ to $N-3$, corresponding to grid indices $j=k+1$ which run from $1$ to $N-2$.\n\nThe task is to find the smallest eigenvalue of this matrix $H$, which approximates the ground state energy $E_0$. Since the matrix is tridiagonal and Hermitian (real symmetric), highly efficient numerical algorithms exist. We will use a specialized solver designed for such matrices, which is significantly faster than general-purpose eigensolvers. The error of the finite difference approximation is of order $O((\\Delta r)^2)$, so we expect the error in the computed eigenvalue to also converge as $O((\\Delta r)^2)$. This implies that doubling the number of grid points $N$ (roughly halving $\\Delta r$) should reduce the absolute error by a factor of approximately $4$.
