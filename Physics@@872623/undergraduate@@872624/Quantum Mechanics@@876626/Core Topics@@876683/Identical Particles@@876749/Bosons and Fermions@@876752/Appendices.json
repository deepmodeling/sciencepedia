Assuming the electrons can occupy any of these five states, determine the total number of distinct microstates possible for this three-electron system. A microstate is defined by the specific set of occupied energy states.", "solution": "Because the particles are electrons, they are indistinguishable fermions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle: no more than one electron can occupy a given single-particle quantum state. The problem specifies five distinct, non-degenerate single-particle states available and defines a microstate by the set of occupied states. Therefore, each microstate is determined by choosing which three of the five available single-particle states are occupied, with no ordering and no multiple occupancy.\n\nThe number of distinct microstates is the number of 3-element subsets of a 5-element set, given by the binomial coefficient\n$$\n\\binom{5}{3}=\\frac{5!}{3!\\,2!}=10.\n$$\nThus, there are 10 distinct microstates.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10}$$", "id": "1983899"}, {"introduction": "While fermions are governed by exclusion, bosons follow entirely different statistical rules, allowing multiple particles to occupy a single state.

For a spin-1/2 particle in this potential, a complete quantum state is specified by two quantum numbers: the energy level index $n$ and the spin projection quantum number $m_s$, which can take values of $+\\frac{1}{2}$ (spin-up, $\\uparrow$) or $-\\frac{1}{2}$ (spin-down, $\\downarrow$). This means that each energy level $E_n$ is twofold degenerate and can hold at most two fermions: one spin-up and one spin-down.\n\nTo find the ground state of the three-fermion system, we must place the particles into the lowest available single-particle states.\nThe lowest single-particle energy level is for $n=0$, with energy $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega$. We can place two fermions in this level, one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\nThe third fermion cannot go into the $n=0$ level as it is now full. It must occupy the next lowest available energy level, which is for $n=1$, with energy $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$. The spin of this third fermion can be either up or down, but its energy is still $E_1$.\n\nThe total ground state energy of the fermionic system, $E_{F,0}$, is the sum of the energies of these three particles:\n$$E_{F,0} = E_0 + E_0 + E_1 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega\\right) + \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega\\right) = \\hbar\\omega + \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$$\n\nNext, let's consider the case where the three particles are spin-0 bosons.\nBosons do not obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Any number of identical bosons can occupy the same single-particle quantum state. To find the ground state of the N-boson system, we simply place all N particles into the lowest available single-particle energy state.\nFor spin-0 bosons, the quantum state is defined solely by the quantum number $n$.\nThe lowest single-particle energy state is the $n=0$ state, with energy $E_0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\nAll three bosons will occupy this ground state.\n\nThe total ground state energy of the bosonic system, $E_{B,0}$, is the sum of the energies of the three particles in the $n=0$ state:\n$$E_{B,0} = E_0 + E_0 + E_0 = 3 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega\\right) = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference in the ground state energies, $\\Delta E_0 = E_{F,0} - E_{B,0}$:\n$$\\Delta E_0 = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega - \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{2}{2}\\hbar\\omega = \\hbar\\omega$$\nThis energy difference can be interpreted as the \"exclusion energy\" or \"quantum pressure\" that arises from the Pauli principle for fermions, forcing them to occupy higher energy levels than bosons.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\hbar \\omega}$$", "id": "2082519"}]}
