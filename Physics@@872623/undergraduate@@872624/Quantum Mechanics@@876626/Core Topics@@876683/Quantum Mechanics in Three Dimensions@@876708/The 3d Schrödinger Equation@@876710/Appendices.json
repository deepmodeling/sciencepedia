The potential energy function is symmetric with respect to the plane $z=L/2$. Consequently, the probability density function for any stationary state must also be symmetric about this plane, forcing the average value of $z$ to be $L/2$.\n\nB. For the particle to be confined, its average momentum in the z-direction must be zero, $\\langle p_z \\rangle = 0$.

A classical particle would spend equal time at all z-positions, giving an average of $L/2$. This classical result must hold for all quantum states.\n\nD. The z-component of the energy for a stationary state is proportional to $n_z^2$, while the position operator $z$ is linear.
