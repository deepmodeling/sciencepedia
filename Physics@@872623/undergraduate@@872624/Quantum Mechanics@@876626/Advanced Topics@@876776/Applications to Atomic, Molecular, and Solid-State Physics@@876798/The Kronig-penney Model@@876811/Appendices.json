The electron, with mass $m$, moves in a periodic potential created by a lattice of ions spaced a distance $a$ apart. In this simplified model, the interaction between the electron and the ions is represented by a periodic array of Dirac delta function barriers.\n\nThe relationship between the electron's energy $E$ (where $E>0$) and its crystal wave number $k$ is given by the following dispersion relation, derived from the time-independent Schrödinger equation and Bloch's theorem:\n$$ \\cos(ka) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{a\\sqrt{2mE}}{\\hbar}\\right) + \\frac{mP}{\\hbar\\sqrt{2mE}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{a\\sqrt{2mE}}{\\hbar}\\right) $$\nHere, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $P$ is a parameter representing the strength of the potential barriers.\n\nConsider a hypothetical material where the interaction between the electrons and the ionic lattice is extremely weak. Determine the energy spectrum $E(k)$ for the electron in this material by taking the limit where the barrier strength $P$ approaches zero.

We can express the energy $E$ in terms of $K$ as $E = \\frac{\\hbar^2 K^2}{2m}$. Substituting $K$ into the dispersion relation gives:\n$$ \\cos(ka) = \\cos(Ka) + \\frac{mP}{\\hbar^2 K} \\sin(Ka) $$\nNow, we can take the limit of this equation as $P \\to 0$:\n$$ \\lim_{P \\to 0} \\cos(ka) = \\lim_{P \\to 0} \\left[ \\cos(Ka) + \\frac{mP}{\\hbar^2 K} \\sin(Ka) \\right] $$\nThe left side is independent of $P$.

Therefore, as $P \\to 0$, this second term vanishes.\n$$ \\cos(ka) = \\cos(Ka) + 0 $$\nThe dispersion relation simplifies significantly to:\n$$ \\cos(ka) = \\cos(Ka) $$\nThe general solution to an equation of the form $\\cos(x) = \\cos(y)$ is $x = \\pm y + 2\\pi n$, where $n$ is an integer. Applying this to our equation, we get:\n$$ ka = \\pm Ka + 2\\pi n $$\nIn the context of solid-state physics, the integer $n$ accounts for the different energy bands, which can be folded into the first Brillouin zone in the reduced zone scheme. However, as the potential vanishes ($P \\to 0$), the band gaps disappear, and the energy bands merge to form the continuous spectrum of a free particle. The most direct physical interpretation is to consider the case where $n=0$, which connects the crystal momentum $k$ directly to the free particle wave number $K$. This gives:\n$$ ka = \\pm Ka $$\nSince $a \\neq 0$, we can divide by it:\n$$ k = \\pm K $$\nThis means the magnitude of the crystal wave number becomes equal to the magnitude of the free particle wave number, $|k| = K$. Since energy depends on the square of the wave number, the sign is irrelevant for the energy calculation.\n\nNow, we substitute back the definition of $K = \\frac{\\sqrt{2mE}}{\\hbar}$:\n$$ |k| = \\frac{\\sqrt{2mE}}{\\hbar} $$\nTo find the energy $E$ as a function of the wave number $k$, we square both sides of the equation:\n$$ k^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2mE}}{\\hbar}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2} $$\nFinally, we solve for $E$:\n$$ E(k) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} $$\nThis is the well-known parabolic energy-momentum relation for a free particle, which is the physically expected result when the periodic potential is removed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\hbar^{2}k^{2}}{2m}}$$", "id": "2134993"}, {"introduction": "Having confirmed that the Kronig-Penney model reduces to the free electron gas, we now explore its most important feature: the formation of energy band gaps.
