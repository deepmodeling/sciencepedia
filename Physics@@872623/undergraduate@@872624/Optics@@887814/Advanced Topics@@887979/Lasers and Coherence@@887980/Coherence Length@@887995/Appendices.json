Interference between the two beams depends on their optical path difference (OPD).\n\nWithout the plate, the OPD at a point on the screen is determined by the geometry of the double-slit setup. Let's denote this geometric path difference as $\\Delta_{geom}$. The total OPD is then the sum of the geometric part and the part introduced by the plate. We are interested in the additional OPD introduced solely by the plate, as this is what affects the coherence requirement.\n\nLet's consider two parallel rays, one passing through the location of the plate without the plate being present (path 1) and one passing through the plate (path 2).\nThe optical path length for a ray traveling a geometric distance $t$ in vacuum (refractive index $n_0 = 1$) is:\n$$OPL_1 = 1 \\cdot t = t$$\n\nThe optical path length for a ray traveling the same geometric distance $t$ but through the transparent plate (refractive index $n$) is:\n$$OPL_2 = n \\cdot t$$\n\nThe additional optical path difference, $\\Delta_{plate}$, introduced by inserting the plate is the difference between these two optical path lengths:\n$$\\Delta_{plate} = OPL_2 - OPL_1 = nt - t = (n-1)t$$\n\nInterference fringes are observable only if the total optical path difference between the two interfering beams is less than the coherence length, $L_c$, of the light source. The plate introduces a fixed path difference, $\\Delta_{plate}$, between the two beams, independent of the position on the screen. The condition for observing interference at any point on the screen is that this intrinsic path difference must not exceed the coherence length. If $\\Delta_{plate}$ itself is greater than or equal to $L_c$, the two beams are effectively incoherent, and no interference pattern can be formed, regardless of the geometric path difference.\n\nThe interference pattern vanishes completely when the optical path difference introduced by the plate becomes equal to the coherence length of the source.
