This allows for the simultaneous measurement of both the object's absorption (from amplitude) and its phase-delay profile (e.g., thickness variations).\n\nConsider an experimental setup where a monochromatic laser beam is split into two paths. One beam illuminates a thin, transparent object, creating an object wave $O(x, y)$ at a detector plane. The second beam serves as a reference wave, which is a uniform plane wave described as $R_k(x, y) = A_R \\exp(i \\alpha_k)$.

The setup uses a coherent laser with wavelength $\\lambda$ and a thin convex lens of focal length $f$. The hologram is recorded by a digital sensor, such as a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD), which has square pixels with a side length (pixel pitch) of $p$.\n\nThe optical configuration is as follows:\n1.  The biological sample, treated as a two-dimensional object, is placed in the front focal plane of the lens and is centered on the optical axis.\n2.  The digital sensor is placed in the back focal plane of the lens to capture the Fourier transform of the object wave.\n3.  A collimated reference beam (a plane wave) is incident on the sensor at an angle $\\theta_{ref}$ with respect to the optical axis. This creates an off-axis hologram.\n\nTo ensure clear separation of the reconstructed image from the zero-order diffraction term and the twin image, a common practice is to set the reference beam angle to be at least twice the maximum diffraction angle from the object. For this setup, we will enforce the specific condition $\\theta_{ref} = 2\\alpha_{max}$, where $\\alpha_{max}$ is the maximum angle made by a ray from the edge of the object with the optical axis after passing through the lens.\n\nThe pixelated nature of the sensor imposes a fundamental limit on the recording process. To avoid aliasing and loss of information, the sensor must be able to resolve the finest details of the interference pattern (hologram). This is governed by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, which dictates that the sampling frequency must be at least twice the maximum spatial frequency present in the signal.\n\nAssuming that all angles are small enough for the approximation $\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\tan(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$ to be valid, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the maximum possible radius, $r_{max}$, of the circular object that can be successfully recorded with this system.", "solution": "We treat the circular object of radius $r$ as lying in the front focal plane of a thin lens of focal length $f$.
