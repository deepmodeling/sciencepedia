This type of lens is composed of two thin lenses, made from different types of glass, placed in contact. The primary goal of an achromatic doublet is to correct for chromatic aberration by ensuring that light of at least two different wavelengths (e.g., red and blue) comes to the same focal point. For this design, the overall combination must act as a converging lens system, meaning it has a net positive optical power.\n\nThe engineer has two materials available:\n- A sample of Crown glass, which has a low dispersion, characterized by an Abbe number of $V_{crown} = 64.17$.\n- A sample of Flint glass, which has a high dispersion, characterized by an Abbe number of $V_{flint} = 36.37$.\n\nThe Abbe number is a measure of a material's dispersion; a higher Abbe number corresponds to lower dispersion. The condition for two thin lenses in contact to form an achromatic doublet is that their individual optical powers, $P_1$ and $P_2$, and their respective Abbe numbers, $V_1$ and $V_2$, satisfy the equation $\\frac{P_1}{V_1} + \\frac{P_2}{V_2} = 0$. For this condition to be met with materials of different Abbe numbers, one lens must have positive power (converging) and the other must have negative power (diverging).\n\nGiven that the final achromatic doublet must be a converging lens system, which material should be used to make the positive (converging) element and which should be used for the negative (diverging) element?\n\nA.
