By thinking through how different rays are imaged, you can predict the qualitative shape of the resulting aberration, known as coma, providing a powerful link between the mathematical formalism and the visual quality of an image.", "problem": "An optical engineer is characterizing a custom-designed objective lens. The lens is intended to form a real, inverted image. For simplicity, assume the object and image spaces are both in air (refractive index $n=1$).\n\nThe engineer first tests the lens with an on-axis point source and finds that it is perfectly corrected for spherical aberration. However, further analysis of off-axis performance reveals an imperfection. Let $\\theta_o$ be the angle a ray from an off-axis object point makes with the optical axis before entering the lens. The engineer's ray-tracing simulation shows that the magnitude of the transverse magnification, $|M(\\theta_o)|$, varies with this angle according to the relation:\n$$|M(\\theta_o)| = |M_0| (1 + \\alpha \\tan^2(\\theta_o))$$\nwhere $M_0$ is the paraxial magnification (for rays with $\\theta_o \\to 0$) and $\\alpha$ is a small, positive constant that quantifies the aberration.\n\nThe engineer places a single, unresolved point source of light in the object plane, slightly above the optical axis.

For a real, inverted image in air, the paraxial transverse magnification is negative, so we write $M_{0}=-|M_{0}|$.

Thus the locus of ray intercepts forms an asymmetric blur that starts at the paraxial image point and extends away from the optical axis as $|\\theta_{o}|$ increases.\n\nBecause the aberration is small ($\\alpha$ small) and many rays cluster near $\\theta_{o}\\approx 0$, the brightest concentration of energy (the “head”) occurs near the paraxial image position, while the less intense “tail” is formed by rays of larger $|\\theta_{o}|$ and extends away from the optical axis. The blur is not centered exactly at the paraxial position nor is it symmetric; it is a classic comet-shaped PSF with its tail pointing away from the axis.\n\nTherefore, among the options given, the correct qualitative description is: an asymmetric comet shape whose brightest part is at the paraxial image position with the tail extending away from the optical axis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2258305"}]}
