The specific task is to convert a beam of linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light. This is typically achieved by passing the beam through a quarter-wave plate (QWP). The protocol specifies that the input beam must be linearly polarized with its electric field oscillating at an angle of 45 degrees with respect to the fast axis of the QWP.\n\nAn engineer sets up the experiment using a monochromatic laser beam that is first sent through a linear polarizer. This prepared beam is then incident on a wave plate. Due to a labeling error on the optics shelf, the engineer mistakenly uses a half-wave plate (HWP) instead of the intended QWP. The orientation is set up correctly, however, such that the incident light's direction of polarization is at 45 degrees to the fast axis of the HWP.\n\nLet the direction of light propagation be the z-axis.
