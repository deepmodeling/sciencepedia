Two different configurations are studied.\n\nIn `Configuration 1`, the screen is completely transparent except for a small, thin, opaque object placed at its center. This object has the shape of a perfect plus sign (+), formed by the union of a vertical rectangle and a horizontal rectangle of identical dimensions, intersecting at their centers.\n\nIn `Configuration 2`, a complementary screen is used. This screen is completely opaque, except for a transparent aperture at its center that has the exact size and plus-sign shape as the object in `Configuration 1`.\n\nThe resulting diffraction patterns of intensity are observed on a distant viewing screen in the far field for both configurations.

Let the incident field be $U_{\\mathrm{inc}}(x,y,z)=U_{0}\\exp(i k z)$, with wavenumber $k=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}$. The Fraunhofer diffraction amplitude produced by a planar transmission function $T(x,y)$ is (up to an overall phase and scale factor) given by the two-dimensional Fourier transform of $T$:\n$$\nU(\\boldsymbol{q}) \\propto \\iint T(x,y)\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-i\\,\\boldsymbol{q}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{r}_{\\perp}\\right)\\,dx\\,dy,\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{r}_{\\perp}=(x,y)$ and $\\boldsymbol{q}$ is the transverse spatial frequency proportional to the observation angle. The “very center” of the diffraction pattern corresponds to $\\boldsymbol{q}=\\boldsymbol{0}$, i.e., the forward (on-axis) direction.\n\nStep 1: Central amplitude for an aperture. For an aperture of shape $S$ with $T(x,y)=1$ on $S$ and $T=0$ elsewhere, the on-axis amplitude is\n$$\nU_{S}(\\boldsymbol{0}) \\propto \\iint_{S} 1\\,dx\\,dy = A_{S},\n$$\nthe area of the aperture. Thus any finite, nonzero-area aperture has a nonzero, maximal central amplitude; in particular, a semi-circular aperture has $A_{S}=\\frac{1}{2}\\pi a^{2}$ (if the radius is $a$), so its Fraunhofer pattern has a single bright central spot.\n\nStep 2: Babinet’s principle for the complementary obstacle. Let $T_{A}(x,y)$ be the transmission of the semi-circular aperture (unity on the semi-disk, zero elsewhere in the screen plane) and $T_{C}(x,y)=1-T_{A}(x,y)$ be the complementary transmission (opaque screen with a semi-circular opening). Babinet’s principle states that, for all nonzero transverse spatial frequencies $\\boldsymbol{q}\\neq\\boldsymbol{0}$,\n$$\nU_{A}(\\boldsymbol{q}) + U_{C}(\\boldsymbol{q}) = 0,\n$$\nso the diffracted fields of complementary objects are negatives of each other away from the undiffracted beam, giving identical intensities off-axis. At $\\boldsymbol{q}=\\boldsymbol{0}$, the Fourier transform of the constant background in $T_{C}$ contributes the undiffracted plane-wave term, and the aperture contributes $U_{A}(\\boldsymbol{0})\\propto A_{S}>0$. Physically, the opaque object’s on-axis field equals the incident plane wave plus the edge-diffracted contribution. Because at $\\boldsymbol{q}=\\boldsymbol{0}$ all contributions from the boundary arrive in phase, the on-axis diffracted component is real and produces constructive interference (the classic Arago/Poisson-spot mechanism generalized). Hence the center cannot be dark; it is a bright point.\n\nStep 3: Effect of asymmetry. Although the semi-circular shape breaks circular symmetry and makes the overall pattern asymmetric off-axis, the on-axis amplitude depends only on the zero-frequency component (the area contribution for an aperture, or equivalently the coherent edge contribution for the obstacle). Therefore, the very center remains a single bright spot. It is not split into two (which would require a zero of the central Fourier component and a symmetry that enforces a nodal line through the origin), nor is it an extended uniform region (Fraunhofer maxima are localized), nor a central dark spot (contradicted by the constructive on-axis interference).\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that the center contains a single bright spot due to constructive interference.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2219908"}, {"introduction": "A deep understanding of any physical principle requires knowing its boundaries and the conditions under which its simplified forms apply. Babinet's principle is often stated as 'complementary screens produce identical diffraction patterns,' but this is an approximation. This practice [@problem_id:2219913] presents an apparent paradox by applying the principle to a limiting case—an infinite screen—to reveal why this simplified statement can fail. Resolving this contradiction will lead you to the more fundamental and universally correct statement of the principle, which relates the sum of the complex amplitudes $U_1$ and $U_2$ to the unobstructed field $U_0$.", "problem": "Babinet's principle in optics provides a powerful relationship between the diffraction patterns produced by complementary screens. Two screens are considered complementary if the opaque regions of one screen correspond exactly to the transparent regions of the other, and vice versa. The principle states that for a point P on an observation screen, the sum of the complex amplitudes of the waves diffracted by two complementary screens, $U_1(P)$ and $U_2(P)$, is equal to the amplitude of the unobstructed wave, $U_0(P)$, at that same point. That is, $U_1(P) + U_2(P) = U_0(P)$. A key consequence is that in any region where the unobstructed wave would be zero (i.e., in the geometrical shadow), $U_0(P)=0$, which implies $U_1(P) = -U_2(P)$. This means the intensities, $I_1 = |U_1|^2$ and $I_2 = |U_2|^2$, are identical in these regions.\n\nAn optics student observes in a Fraunhofer diffraction experiment that the pattern from a small opaque circular disk is nearly identical to the pattern from a circular aperture of the same diameter, except for the very center of the pattern. This observation seems to confirm Babinet's principle.\n\nHowever, the student is troubled by a limiting case. Consider a completely opaque screen (an \"infinite disk\") and a completely open screen (an \"infinite aperture\"). These are also complementary screens. Yet, their \"diffraction\" patterns are completely different: the opaque screen produces zero intensity everywhere, while the open screen allows the unobstructed plane wave to pass with full intensity everywhere. This appears to be a direct contradiction of the principle that worked so well for the finite disk and aperture.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct physical reasoning to resolve this apparent contradiction?\n\nA. Babinet's principle is derived using the small-angle approximation, which is valid for a small disk/aperture but inherently invalid for an infinite screen.\n\nB. The equivalence of diffraction patterns predicted by Babinet's principle only holds in the Fraunhofer (far-field) regime, whereas the case of an infinite screen must be treated as a near-field problem.\n\nC. The relationship $U_1(P) = -U_2(P)$ applies only to regions where the unobstructed wave has zero amplitude. For an infinite aperture, the unobstructed wave has non-zero amplitude everywhere, so this relationship is never applicable.\n\nD. Babinet's principle applies only to objects that diffract light significantly. A perfectly opaque screen absorbs all light and does not cause diffraction, thus the principle does not apply.\n\nE. The principle requires the physical material of the opaque sections of the complementary screens to be the same, a condition which is not specified for the infinite screen scenario.", "solution": "We start from the scalar diffraction formulation based on the Huygens–Fresnel principle with Kirchhoff boundary conditions. Let the incident field on the screen be $U_{\\text{inc}}(\\boldsymbol{r})$, the complex transmission function of a screen be $T(\\boldsymbol{r})$, and the propagation kernel to the observation point $P$ be $K(P,\\boldsymbol{r})$. The diffracted field at $P$ is given by the linear integral\n$$\nU(P)=\\iint T(\\boldsymbol{r})\\,U_{\\text{inc}}(\\boldsymbol{r})\\,K(P,\\boldsymbol{r})\\,\\mathrm{d}^{2}r.\n$$\nFor two complementary screens with transmissions $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ satisfying $T_{1}(\\boldsymbol{r})+T_{2}(\\boldsymbol{r})=1$ for all $\\boldsymbol{r}$, linearity gives\n$$\nU_{1}(P)+U_{2}(P)=\\iint \\bigl(T_{1}+T_{2}\\bigr)\\,U_{\\text{inc}}\\,K\\,\\mathrm{d}^{2}r=\\iint U_{\\text{inc}}\\,K\\,\\mathrm{d}^{2}r\\equiv U_{0}(P),\n$$\nwhich is Babinet’s relation $U_{1}(P)+U_{2}(P)=U_{0}(P)$, where $U_{0}(P)$ is the unobstructed field.\n\nFrom this exact relation, the special consequence $U_{1}(P)=-U_{2}(P)$ follows only when $U_{0}(P)=0$. In that case,\n$$\nU_{0}(P)=0\\implies U_{1}(P)+U_{2}(P)=0\\implies U_{1}(P)=-U_{2}(P)\\implies |U_{1}(P)|^{2}=|U_{2}(P)|^{2}.\n$$\nThus, equality of intensities for complementary screens is confined to those regions where the unobstructed field vanishes (the geometrical shadow).\n\nConsider now the “infinite disk” (completely opaque) and the “infinite aperture” (completely open). Their transmissions are $T_{1}(\\boldsymbol{r})=0$ and $T_{2}(\\boldsymbol{r})=1$, which are complementary. Applying the same linearity:\n$$\nU_{1}(P)=\\iint 0\\cdot U_{\\text{inc}}\\,K\\,\\mathrm{d}^{2}r=0,\\qquad U_{2}(P)=\\iint 1\\cdot U_{\\text{inc}}\\,K\\,\\mathrm{d}^{2}r=U_{0}(P),\n$$\nso $U_{1}(P)+U_{2}(P)=U_{0}(P)$ holds identically. There is no contradiction with Babinet’s principle. The reason the intensities differ everywhere is simply that $U_{0}(P)\\neq 0$ at every observation point behind an infinite aperture, so the condition $U_{0}(P)=0$ required to deduce $U_{1}(P)=-U_{2}(P)$ is never met.\n\nIn the Fraunhofer regime, the same conclusion appears in Fourier optics language. Writing the far-field amplitude as proportional to the Fourier transform of the pupil $T$,\n$$\nU(\\boldsymbol{q})\\propto \\mathcal{F}\\{T(\\boldsymbol{r})\\}(\\boldsymbol{q}),\n$$\ncomplementarity gives\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}\\{T_{1}\\}+\\mathcal{F}\\{T_{2}\\}=\\mathcal{F}\\{1\\}\\propto \\delta(\\boldsymbol{q}),\n$$\nso the two far-field amplitudes sum to a delta distribution at the optical axis. Away from the axis, the two patterns differ only by the presence of this undiffracted term; exactly at the axis they differ, which explains the observed central-spot difference for a finite disk/aperture. For the infinite aperture versus infinite opaque screen, one has $\\mathcal{F}\\{T_{1}\\}=0$ and $\\mathcal{F}\\{T_{2}\\}\\propto \\delta(\\boldsymbol{q})$, which is again fully consistent with Babinet’s relation.\n\nTherefore, the correct resolution is that the inference $U_{1}(P)=-U_{2}(P)$, and hence identical intensities, applies only where $U_{0}(P)=0$. For an infinite aperture, $U_{0}(P)$ is nonzero everywhere, so that inference is never applicable. This corresponds to option C, and the remaining options are incorrect for the following reasons: the derivation does not rely on a small-angle approximation (A is false), the principle holds equally in near- and far-field provided linear scalar diffraction applies (B is irrelevant to the contradiction), diffraction does occur from opaque objects with edges and Babinet still applies (D is false), and the principle does not require identical materials beyond their scalar transmittance functions (E is false).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2219913"}]}
