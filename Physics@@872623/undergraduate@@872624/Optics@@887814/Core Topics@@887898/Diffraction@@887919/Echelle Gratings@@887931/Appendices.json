The spectrograph is set up in a Littrow configuration, where the diffracted light of interest travels back along the same path as the incident light. To maximize the efficiency for a particular wavelength, the grating is oriented such that the angle of incidence is equal to the blaze angle, causing specular reflection from the groove facets to be directed into the desired diffraction order.\n\nDetermine the specific blaze wavelength, $\\lambda_B$, for which this grating provides maximum efficiency when operating in the diffraction order $m=75$.
