By solving this, you will bridge the gap between abstract field theory and the familiar circuit formula $P = VI$.", "problem": "A very long coaxial cable is used to transmit power from a source to a distant load. The cable consists of a solid inner cylindrical conductor of radius $a$ and a concentric outer cylindrical shell of inner radius $b$. A steady, direct current $I$ flows along the inner conductor and returns along the outer conductor. Due to the charge distribution required to drive this current, a constant potential difference $V$ is maintained between the two conductors, with the inner conductor being at a higher potential. The space between the conductors, for $a < r < b$, is filled with a dielectric material with permeability $\\mu_0$ and permittivity $\\epsilon_0$.\n\nAssuming the cable is infinitely long and the fields are static, calculate the total power transported by the electromagnetic fields through the dielectric region.
