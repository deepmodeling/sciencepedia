In this setup, a high-refractive-index glass prism ($n_1$) is used, whose top face is in contact with an aqueous solution ($n_2$, where $n_2  n_1$) containing the nanoparticles. Two coherent, identically polarized laser beams, generated from the same source with a vacuum wavelength of $\\lambda_0$, are directed into the prism.

Determine the spatial period of this one-dimensional intensity pattern along the $x$-axis.\n\nExpress your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $\\lambda_0$, $n_1$, and $\\theta_i$.", "solution": "Let the prism-solution interface be the $xy$-plane at $z=0$. The prism (medium 1) is in the region $z0$ and the aqueous solution (medium 2) is in the region $z0$. The two laser beams are incident from within the prism onto this interface.\n\nFirst, let's establish the properties of the light waves. The magnitude of the wave vector of light in a medium with refractive index $n$ is $k = n k_0$, where $k_0 = 2\\pi/\\lambda_0$ is the wave vector magnitude in vacuum. In our case, the wave vector magnitude in the prism is $k_1 = n_1 k_0$.\n\nThe two incident beams are counter-propagating along the $x$-axis at the interface. Let the plane of incidence be the $xz$-plane. The wave vectors of the two incident beams, $\\vec{k}_{i,1}$ and $\\vec{k}_{i,2}$, can be written in terms of their components. For a wave incident at an angle $\\theta_i$ with respect to the normal (the $z$-axis), the components are:\n-   For the first beam (propagating in the $+x$ direction): $\\vec{k}_{i,1} = k_1 (\\sin\\theta_i \\hat{x} + \\cos\\theta_i \\hat{z})$\n-   For the second beam (propagating in the $-x$ direction): $\\vec{k}_{i,2} = k_1 (-\\sin\\theta_i \\hat{x} + \\cos\\theta_i \\hat{z})$\n\nWhen these waves undergo Total Internal Reflection (TIR), they generate evanescent waves in the rarer medium ($z0$). The boundary conditions require that the component of the wave vector parallel to the interface be conserved upon transmission. Let's denote the wave vectors of the two transmitted (evanescent) waves as $\\vec{k}_{t,1}$ and $\\vec{k}_{t,2}$.\n\nFor the first evanescent wave:\nThe $x$-component is conserved: $k_{t,x,1} = k_{i,x,1} = k_1 \\sin\\theta_i$.\nLet's call this component $k_x = k_1 \\sin\\theta_i$.\n\nFor the second evanescent wave:\nThe $x$-component is conserved: $k_{t,x,2} = k_{i,x,2} = -k_1 \\sin\\theta_i = -k_x$.\n\nNow, let's find the $z$-component of the transmitted wave vector, $k_{t,z}$. The magnitude of the wave vector in medium 2 should be $k_2 = n_2 k_0$. The wave vector components in medium 2 must satisfy $k_{t,x}^2 + k_{t,z}^2 = k_2^2$. Note that $k_t$ is the same for both waves since $|k_{t,x,1}| = |k_{t,x,2}|$.\nSo, $k_{t,z}^2 = k_2^2 - k_x^2 = (n_2 k_0)^2 - (n_1 k_0 \\sin\\theta_i)^2 = k_0^2 (n_2^2 - n_1^2 \\sin^2\\theta_i)$.\n\nSince the system is undergoing TIR, we know that $n_1 \\sin\\theta_i  n_2$. This implies that $n_2^2 - n_1^2 \\sin^2\\theta_i  0$. Therefore, $k_{t,z}^2$ is negative, and its square root $k_{t,z}$ must be purely imaginary.\nLet $k_{t,z} = i\\alpha$, where $\\alpha = \\sqrt{k_0^2 (n_1^2 \\sin^2\\theta_i - n_2^2)} = k_0 \\sqrt{n_1^2 \\sin^2\\theta_i - n_2^2}$. The real value $\\alpha$ is the decay constant of the evanescent wave.\n\nThe electric fields of the two evanescent waves in the region $z0$ can now be written. Assuming they have the same amplitude $E_0$ and are in phase at the origin (any constant phase difference will not affect the spatial period):\n-   First evanescent wave: $E_1(x, z, t) = E_0 \\exp(i(\\vec{k}_{t,1} \\cdot \\vec{r} - \\omega t)) = E_0 \\exp(i(k_x x + i\\alpha z - \\omega t)) = E_0 \\exp(-\\alpha z) \\exp(i(k_x x - \\omega t))$.\n-   Second evanescent wave: $E_2(x, z, t) = E_0 \\exp(i(\\vec{k}_{t,2} \\cdot \\vec{r} - \\omega t)) = E_0 \\exp(i(-k_x x + i\\alpha z - \\omega t)) = E_0 \\exp(-\\alpha z) \\exp(i(-k_x x - \\omega t))$.\n\nThe total electric field in the solution is the superposition of these two fields:\n$E_{total}(x, z, t) = E_1 + E_2 = E_0 \\exp(-\\alpha z) [\\exp(i(k_x x - \\omega t)) + \\exp(i(-k_x x - \\omega t))]$\n$E_{total}(x, z, t) = E_0 \\exp(-\\alpha z) \\exp(-i\\omega t) [\\exp(ik_x x) + \\exp(-ik_x x)]$\n\nUsing Euler's identity, $\\exp(i\\theta) + \\exp(-i\\theta) = 2\\cos(\\theta)$, we get:\n$E_{total}(x, z, t) = 2 E_0 \\exp(-\\alpha z) \\cos(k_x x) \\exp(-i\\omega t)$\n\nThis is the equation of a standing wave. The intensity of the light is proportional to the time-averaged square of the magnitude of the electric field, $I \\propto \\langle |E_{total}|^2 \\rangle$.\n$I(x,z) \\propto |2 E_0 \\exp(-\\alpha z) \\cos(k_x x)|^2 = 4 E_0^2 \\exp(-2\\alpha z) \\cos^2(k_x x)$.\n\nThe spatial variation of the intensity along the $x$-axis is described by the term $\\cos^2(k_x x)$. The spatial period, $\\Lambda$, is the smallest distance over which this pattern repeats. We can use the trigonometric identity $\\cos^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\cos(2\\theta))$ to analyze the periodicity.\n$I(x,z) \\propto 4 E_0^2 \\exp(-2\\alpha z) \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\cos(2k_x x))$.\n\nThe pattern's spatial frequency along $x$ is determined by the $\\cos(2k_x x)$ term.
