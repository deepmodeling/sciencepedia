It is formed by placing a \"spacer\" layer between two high-reflectivity mirrors. In this case, the mirrors are the symmetric quarter-wave stacks (the DBRs), and the spacer is the central half-wave layer.\n\n1.  **Physical Principle:** At the central wavelength $\\lambda_0$, the quarter-wave stacks on either side are designed to be highly reflective. The central layer has an optical thickness of $\\lambda_0 / 2$. A light wave that makes a round trip inside this layer (traveling through it and back again) accumulates an additional optical path length of $2 \\times (\\lambda_0 / 2) = \\lambda_0$. This corresponds to a round-trip phase shift of exactly $2\\pi$ radians.\n\n2.  **Resonant Transmission:** This $2\\pi$ round-trip phase shift is the condition for resonance. For a symmetric cavity with lossless mirrors, when the resonance condition is met, light waves that are multiply reflected within the cavity interfere constructively in the forward (transmitted) direction and destructively in the backward (reflected) direction. This leads to perfect transmission through the structure.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Since the structure is lossless, the sum of reflectance ($R$) and transmittance ($T$) must be 1 ($R+T=1$). At resonance, the transmittance is perfect ($T=1$), which means the reflectance $R$ must be 0.\n\nA formal proof using the transfer matrix method confirms this. A system whose total transfer matrix is proportional to the identity matrix ($\\pm I$) is perfectly impedance-matched to its surroundings. For the described symmetric structure with a central half-wave layer, the total matrix at $\\lambda_0$ can be shown to be exactly $-I$.
