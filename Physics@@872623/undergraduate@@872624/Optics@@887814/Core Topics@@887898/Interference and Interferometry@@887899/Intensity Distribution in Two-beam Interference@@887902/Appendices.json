This source is positioned at a small height $h$ above the plane of a long, flat mirror. A vertical screen is placed at a large horizontal distance $D$ from the source, such that $D \\gg h$. An interference pattern is observed on the screen, formed by the superposition of light traveling directly from the source to the screen and light that reflects off the mirror before reaching the screen.

Let the direct and reflected optical path lengths from the source to a point on the screen be $\\ell_{d}$ and $\\ell_{r}$, respectively, and define the geometric path difference $\\Delta \\ell = \\ell_{r} - \\ell_{d}$. For a monochromatic component of wavelength $\\lambda$, the phase difference between the reflected and direct waves at the screen is\n$$\n\\Delta \\phi = k\\,\\Delta \\ell + \\pi,\\quad k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}.\n$$\nThe resultant intensity from the superposition of the two waves is\n$$\nI = I_{d} + I_{r} + 2\\sqrt{I_{d}I_{r}}\\cos(\\Delta \\phi),\n$$\nwhere $I_{d}$ and $I_{r}$ are the individual intensities of the direct and reflected waves at the observation point.\n\nAt the “central fringe,” by definition, the geometric path difference vanishes, so $\\Delta \\ell = 0$.

Crucially, because the $\\pi$ phase shift is wavelength-independent, the destructive condition at $\\Delta \\ell = 0$ holds for all spectral components of the white light. Hence the central fringe is dark (not colored), independent of $h$ and $D$.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the central fringe is dark due to the reflection-induced phase shift causing destructive interference for all wavelengths.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2235815"}, {"introduction": "Interferometers are not just for observing static fringe patterns; they are powerful tools for dynamic, high-precision measurements.
