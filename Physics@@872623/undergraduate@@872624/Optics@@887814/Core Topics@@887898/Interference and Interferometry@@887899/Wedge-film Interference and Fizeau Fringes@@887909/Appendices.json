This first practice focuses on that core principle by asking you to determine the exact thickness of an air film at the location of a specific dark fringe. Mastering this calculation is essential, as it directly connects the observable optical effect—the Fizeau fringe—to the microscopic physical dimension you are trying to measure [@problem_id:2274825].", "problem": "A quality control engineer is inspecting a silicon wafer by placing a perfectly flat, transparent optical flat on its surface. Due to a microscopic imperfection, the wafer surface is slightly angled relative to the flat, creating a thin wedge of air between them. The setup is illuminated from directly above with a Helium-Neon (HeNe) Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (LASER) source, which emits monochromatic light with a wavelength of $\\lambda = 632.8$ nm. Interference fringes, known as Fizeau fringes, are observed. Assume the refractive index of the air in the wedge is $n_{air} = 1.00$, the refractive index of the optical flat is $n_{flat}  n_{air}$, and the refractive index of the silicon wafer is $n_{Si}  n_{air}$. Calculate the thickness of the air film at the location of the third dark fringe observed, counting from the point of contact where the thickness is zero.
