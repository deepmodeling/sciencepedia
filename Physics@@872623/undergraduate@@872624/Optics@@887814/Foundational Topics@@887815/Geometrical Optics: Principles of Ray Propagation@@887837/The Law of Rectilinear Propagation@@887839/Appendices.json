The center of the circular disk is moving along the axis connecting the source and the center of the shadow. Let $x(t)$ be the distance of the disk from the source at time $t$. The radius of the disk is $R$. Due to the rectilinear propagation of light, we can use similar triangles to relate the radius of the shadow, $R_s$, to the radius of the disk, $R$.\n\nThe vertices of the two similar triangles are:\n1. The light source.\n2. The center of the disk and the center of the shadow.\n3. A point on the edge of the disk and the corresponding point on the edge of the shadow.\n\nThe height of the smaller triangle is the distance from the source to the disk, $x$. The base of this triangle is the radius of the disk, $R$. The height of the larger triangle is the distance from the source to the screen, $L$. The base of this triangle is the radius of the shadow, $R_s$.\n\nFrom the property of similar triangles, the ratio of corresponding sides is equal:\n$$ \\frac{R_s}{R} = \\frac{L}{x} $$\nFrom this, we can express the radius of the shadow as a function of the disk's position $x$:\n$$ R_s(x) = \\frac{RL}{x} $$\nThe area of the shadow, $A_s$, is given by $A_s = \\pi R_s^2$.
