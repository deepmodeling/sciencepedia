This exercise demonstrates how the thin lens equation can be used not just to find an image, but to define the fundamental boundaries of an optical system's capabilities [@problem_id:2234988].", "problem": "An optical engineer is tasked with designing a simple projection system on a linear optical rail. The system comprises an illuminated object, a single converging thin lens, and a screen. The object is fixed at one end of the rail. The lens and the screen can be moved along the rail to form a sharp, real image of the object on the screen. The total length of the optical rail is $L = 1.35 \\text{ m}$.
