This first practice invites you to apply this fundamental principle to determine a viewing angle within a creatively designed architectural space.

The room's ceiling is a perfect hemisphere of radius $R$, and the floor is a perfectly flat, horizontal mirror. An observer stands inside the room, with their eyes at a height $h$ above the floor. The observer's horizontal distance from the center of the room is $d$. The observer looks down towards the mirrored floor to see the reflection of the highest point (the zenith) of the hemispherical ceiling.\n\nDetermine the angle $\\theta$ that the observer's line of sight makes with the downward vertical direction. Express your answer in radians as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of the given parameters $R$, $d$, and $h$.", "solution": "Let the floor be the plane $z=0$ with the center of the room at the origin. The hemispherical ceiling of radius $R$ has its zenith at $Z=(0,0,R)$. The observer’s eye is at $P=(d,0,h)$, where $d$ is the horizontal distance from the center and $h$ is the height above the floor.\n\nBy the method of images for a plane mirror, the reflection of the zenith across the floor is the image point $Z'=(0,0,-R)$. A light ray seen in the mirror along the observer’s line of sight is thus collinear with the straight segment from $P$ to $Z'$.\n\nThe line-of-sight vector is\n$$\n\\vec{v}=Z'-P=\\langle -d,\\,0,\\,-R-h \\rangle.\n$$\nThe downward vertical direction is the unit vector $-\\hat{k}=(0,0,-1)$.

This exercise examines the classic scenario of two mirrors placed at a right angle, which generates a set of distinct virtual images. Your task is to systematically account for all possible reflections, including images of images, to determine the total number of unique images an observer can see [@problem_id:2234786].", "problem": "An artist is designing a modern sculpture called \"Reflective Quadrant.\" The core of the installation consists of two large, perfectly flat plane mirrors. These mirrors are joined along a common edge to form a perfect right-angled corner. We can model this setup in a Cartesian coordinate system. The first mirror, M1, lies on the y-z plane for $x=0$ and $y \\geq 0$. The second mirror, M2, lies on the x-z plane for $y=0$ and $x \\geq 0$. The reflecting surfaces of the mirrors face the first quadrant ($x>0, y>0$).\n\nA small, bright point source of light, which we will treat as a point object, is placed at coordinates $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$, where $x_0 = 1.2$ meters, $y_0 = 2.0$ meters, and $z_0 = 0.5$ meters. Note that the object is not placed on the line that bisects the angle between the mirrors.\n\nAn observer can move freely within the first quadrant to view the images formed by reflections in the mirrors. How many distinct images of the point source can be seen in total?", "solution": "We model the two plane mirrors as half-planes intersecting along the $z$-axis: $M_{1}$ is the plane $x=0$ for $y \\geq 0$ and $M_{2}$ is the plane $y=0$ for $x \\geq 0$, with reflecting surfaces facing the first quadrant. The point object is at $\\mathbf{r}_{0}=(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$ with $x_{0}>0$, $y_{0}>0$, and $z_{0}>0$, specifically $x_{0}=1.2$, $y_{0}=2.0$, $z_{0}=0.5$, and it is not on the angle bisector $x=y$.\n\nPhysical principle: In a plane mirror, the image of a point is obtained by reflecting the point across the mirror plane. For a plane through the origin with unit normal $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$, the image $\\mathbf{r}'$ of $\\mathbf{r}$ is given by\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}'=\\mathbf{r}-2\\left(\\mathbf{r}\\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}\\right)\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}.\n$$\nApplying this to $M_{1}$ (plane $x=0$ with $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}=\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$) gives the single-reflection image\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_{1}=R_{x=0}(\\mathbf{r}_{0})=\\left(-x_{0},\\,y_{0},\\,z_{0}\\right).\n$$\nApplying it to $M_{2}$ (plane $y=0$ with $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}=\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$) gives the other single-reflection image\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_{2}=R_{y=0}(\\mathbf{r}_{0})=\\left(x_{0},\\,-y_{0},\\,z_{0}\\right).\n$$\nA double reflection (one reflection in each mirror) corresponds to the composition of two reflections.

No further distinct images arise from higher-order reflections, because the transformations generated by $R_{x=0}$ and $R_{y=0}$ form a group with only four elements $\\{I,\\,R_{x=0},\\,R_{y=0},\\,R_{y=0}R_{x=0}\\}$; thus there are at most three nontrivial images.\n\nVisibility from the first quadrant: Each of these images corresponds to ray paths obeying the law of reflection. For $\\mathbf{r}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{r}_{2}$, standard single-reflection rays exist since the feet of perpendiculars on $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are at $(0,y_{0},z_{0})$ and $(x_{0},0,z_{0})$, respectively, which lie on the reflecting portions ($y_{0}\\geq 0$, $x_{0}\\geq 0$). For $\\mathbf{r}_{12}$, rays from the object can reflect first on $M_{1}$ (at a point with $y\\geq 0$) and then on $M_{2}$ (at a point with $x\\geq 0$) to reach an observer in the first quadrant; this is the standard double-reflection image for perpendicular mirrors. Because the mirrors are semi-infinite in the positive $y$ and $x$ directions, the required reflection points lie on the reflecting surfaces.\n\nTherefore, an observer moving anywhere in the first quadrant can in total see three distinct images: two due to single reflections in $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$, and one due to a double reflection in both mirrors.
