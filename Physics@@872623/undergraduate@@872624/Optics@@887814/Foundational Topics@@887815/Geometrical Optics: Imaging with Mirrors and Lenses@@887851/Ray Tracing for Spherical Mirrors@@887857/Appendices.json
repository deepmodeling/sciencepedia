This first exercise, [@problem_id:2250848], moves beyond simple numerical calculation to explore the qualitative relationship between an object's position and the resulting image's magnification. By analyzing the region between a concave mirror's focal point $F$ and its center of curvature $C$, you will use the mirror and magnification equations to prove a fundamental property of image formation, solidifying your conceptual grasp of why magnification changes as an object moves.", "problem": "A concave spherical mirror with a radius of curvature noted as $R$ is used to form an image of a small object placed on its principal axis. The distance of the object from the mirror's vertex is denoted by $s_o$. It is known that for a concave mirror, there exists a specific object distance, which we will call $s_o^*$, where the resulting real image is exactly the same size as the object.\n\nNow, consider a scenario where the object is placed at a new distance $s_o$ from the vertex, such that it lies strictly between the focal point of the mirror and this critical position $s_o^*$.

This thought experiment, [@problem_id:2250898], is designed to directly challenge that idea and clarify the true nature of image formation. By considering what happens when half of a mirror is obstructed, you will apply the principle that every point on an object radiates light in many directions, and every point on the mirror's surface contributes to the formation of the *entire* image. This practice is crucial for understanding how the aperture of an optical system affects image brightness, not its completeness.", "problem": "A small, point-like Light Emitting Diode (LED) is placed on the principal axis of a large concave spherical mirror. The LED is positioned at a distance from the mirror's vertex that is three times the magnitude of the focal length, ensuring the formation of a real image. An experimenter observes this sharp, bright image on a screen. Subsequently, the experimenter carefully places a flat, opaque card over the mirror, completely covering the lower half of its reflective surface (the portion below the principal axis).\n\nAssuming the approximations of geometric optics are valid and any diffraction effects are negligible, which of the following statements most accurately describes the image seen on the screen after the card is in place?\n\nA.

The bottom half of the image disappears, and the remaining top half becomes half as bright.", "solution": "Let the concave spherical mirror have focal length $f>0$ in the Gaussian (paraxial) sign convention. Place the point-like LED (object) on the principal axis at distance $s=3f$ from the vertex. The mirror (Gaussian) imaging equation is\n$$\n\\frac{1}{f}=\\frac{1}{s}+\\frac{1}{s'} \\, .\n$$\nSubstituting $s=3f$ gives\n$$\n\\frac{1}{f}=\\frac{1}{3f}+\\frac{1}{s'} \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; \\frac{1}{s'}=\\frac{1}{f}-\\frac{1}{3f}=\\frac{2}{3f} \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; s'=\\frac{3f}{2} \\, .\n$$\nThus a real image is formed on the axis at $s'=\\frac{3f}{2}$. The transverse magnification is\n$$\nm=-\\frac{s'}{s}=-\\frac{\\frac{3f}{2}}{3f}=-\\frac{1}{2} \\, ,\n$$\nso an extended object would form an inverted, half-size image; for a point-like LED, the image is a sharp point at $s'=\\frac{3f}{2}$ under geometric optics.\n\nNow consider covering the lower half of the mirror (below the principal axis) with an opaque card. The relevant physical principles are:\n- Law of reflection: Rays from an object point that reach the mirror reflect such that they pass through the corresponding image point determined by the imaging equation.\n- Superposition of rays in geometric optics: For any given object point, all rays that reach any unobstructed part of the mirror and satisfy the reflection law contribute to the same image point. Removing some rays does not change the geometric intersection point where the remaining rays meet.\n- Energy (throughput) considerations: The total radiant flux collected and delivered to the image is proportional to the effective collecting area of the mirror.\n\nApplying these:\n1) Image position and sharpness (geometric): Blocking the lower half removes a subset of rays from every object point but does not alter the imaging relation $\\frac{1}{f}=\\frac{1}{s}+\\frac{1}{s'}$. Therefore the image remains at $s'=\\frac{3f}{2}$ with the same geometric sharpness (no added blur in the geometric-optics limit). Since diffraction effects are assumed negligible, the point-spread function does not broaden due to aperture truncation in this approximation.\n2) Completeness of the image: For an extended object, each image point receives contributions from the entire unobstructed aperture; there is no one-to-one correspondence between a specific half of the mirror and a specific half of the image. Thus the entire image is still formed; no half of the image disappears. For the given point-like LED, the point image remains present.\n3) Brightness: With half the reflective area blocked, the collected flux is reduced by approximately a factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ (assuming uniform illumination and reflectivity), so the irradiance at the image decreases correspondingly. Hence the image becomes dimmer.\n\nTherefore, with geometric optics valid and diffraction neglected, the correct description is that the image remains complete and sharp but is less bright.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2250898"}, {"introduction": "Real-world optical instruments, from telescopes to laser cavities, are rarely composed of a single mirror or lens.

The mirrors are placed facing each other, separated by a distance $L = 100.0$ cm, and their principal axes are aligned. A point source of light, S, is located on this common axis at a distance of $30.0$ cm from the vertex of mirror M1.\n\nA sequence of images is formed by multiple reflections. The light from the source S first reflects from M1 to form an image I1. The light rays corresponding to I1 then travel to M2 and reflect to form a second image, I2.

Express your answer in centimeters (cm), and round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "We will solve this problem by applying the spherical mirror equation iteratively for each reflection. The mirror equation is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{d_o} + \\frac{1}{d_i} = \\frac{1}{f}\n$$\nwhere $d_o$ is the object distance, $d_i$ is the image distance, and $f$ is the focal length of the mirror. We will use a sign convention where distances are measured from the vertex of the mirror involved in the reflection. Real objects and images have positive distances, while virtual objects and images have negative distances. The focal length $f$ of a concave mirror is positive and is related to its radius of curvature $R$ by $f = R/2$.\n\nLet's establish a coordinate system where the vertex of mirror M1 is at $x=0$ and the vertex of mirror M2 is at $x=L=100.0$ cm. The point source S is at $x = 30.0$ cm. The radius of curvature is $R=80.0$ cm for both mirrors, so their focal length is $f = R/2 = 40.0$ cm.\n\n**Step 1: First reflection at Mirror M1**\n\nThe object is the source S. The light from S travels towards M1.\nThe object distance for M1 is the distance from S to M1.\n$d_{o1} = 30.0$ cm. Since this is a real object, its distance is positive.\nThe focal length of M1 is $f = 40.0$ cm.\nUsing the mirror equation to find the image distance $d_{i1}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{30.0} + \\frac{1}{d_{i1}} = \\frac{1}{40.0}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{d_{i1}} = \\frac{1}{40.0} - \\frac{1}{30.0} = \\frac{3 - 4}{120.0} = -\\frac{1}{120.0}\n$$\nSo, $d_{i1} = -120.0$ cm.\nThe negative sign indicates that the image I1 is virtual. It is formed 120.0 cm behind mirror M1. In our coordinate system, the position of I1 is $x_1 = -120.0$ cm.\n\n**Step 2: Second reflection at Mirror M2**\n\nThe image I1 serves as the object for mirror M2. The light rays travel from M1 towards M2.\nThe object distance for M2, $d_{o2}$, is the distance from I1 to M2.\nThe vertex of M2 is at $x=100.0$ cm and I1 is at $x_1 = -120.0$ cm.\nThe distance is $d_{o2} = x_{M2} - x_1 = 100.0 - (-120.0) = 220.0$ cm.\nSince the rays incident on M2 are diverging from the position of I1, it serves as a real object for M2, so $d_{o2}$ is positive.\nThe focal length of M2 is also $f = 40.0$ cm.\nUsing the mirror equation to find the image distance $d_{i2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{220.0} + \\frac{1}{d_{i2}} = \\frac{1}{40.0}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{d_{i2}} = \\frac{1}{40.0} - \\frac{1}{220.0} = \\frac{11 - 2}{440.0} = \\frac{9}{440.0}\n$$\nSo, $d_{i2} = \\frac{440.0}{9}$ cm $\\approx 48.889$ cm.\nThe positive sign indicates that the image I2 is real. It is formed on the same side as the reflected light. Light from the left reflects off M2 and travels to the left. Thus, I2 is formed to the left of M2.\nThe position of I2 in our coordinate system is $x_2 = x_{M2} - d_{i2} = 100.0 - \\frac{440.0}{9} = \\frac{900.0 - 440.0}{9} = \\frac{460.0}{9}$ cm.\n\n**Step 3: Third reflection at Mirror M1**\n\nThe image I2 now serves as the object for mirror M1. The light rays travel from M2 towards M1.\nThe object distance for M1, $d_{o3}$, is the distance from I2 to M1.\nThe vertex of M1 is at $x=0$ and I2 is at $x_2 = 460.0/9$ cm.\nThe distance is $d_{o3} = x_2 - x_{M1} = \\frac{460.0}{9} - 0 = \\frac{460.0}{9}$ cm.\nSince I2 is a physical concentration of light rays between the mirrors, it is a real object for M1, so $d_{o3}$ is positive.\nThe focal length of M1 is $f = 40.0$ cm.\nUsing the mirror equation to find the image distance $d_{i3}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{d_{o3}} + \\frac{1}{d_{i3}} = \\frac{1}{f}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{460.0/9} + \\frac{1}{d_{i3}} = \\frac{1}{40.0}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{9}{460.0} + \\frac{1}{d_{i3}} = \\frac{1}{40.0}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{d_{i3}} = \\frac{1}{40.0} - \\frac{9}{460.0} = \\frac{11.5}{460.0} - \\frac{9}{460.0} = \\frac{2.5}{460.0} = \\frac{5}{920.0} = \\frac{1}{184.0}\n$$\nSo, $d_{i3} = 184.0$ cm.\nThe positive sign indicates that the image I3 is real. It is formed on the side of the reflected light. Light coming from the right reflects off M1 and travels to the right. Thus, I3 is formed to the right of M1.\nThe question asks for the position of I3 measured from the vertex of M1. This is exactly the image distance $d_{i3}$.\nThe position of I3 is at $x_3 = 184.0$ cm from M1.\n\nThe answer must be rounded to four significant figures.
