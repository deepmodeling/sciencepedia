This principle can be used to describe wave phenomena like diffraction and refraction.\n\n**Problem:** Consider the Huygens' construction for the refraction of a plane wave at a planar interface between two media. The wave propagates from a medium with wave speed $v_1$ into a medium with wave speed $v_2$. The incident wavefront makes an angle of incidence $\\theta_1$ with the interface.\n\nThe geometric construction involves two right-angled triangles sharing a common hypotenuse along the interface. Let A and C be two points on the interface. The incident wavefront at $t=0$ passes through A. A ray perpendicular to this wavefront, originating from a point B, reaches C at time $\\Delta t$.
