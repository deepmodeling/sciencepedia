The design requires a specific effective focal length for the entire two-mirror system to achieve the desired magnification and field of view. The telescope consists of a large concave primary mirror and a smaller convex secondary mirror.\n\nThe key design parameters are constrained as follows:\n1.  The desired effective focal length of the telescope must be $F_{eff} = 1500$ mm.\n2.  The physical separation between the vertex of the primary mirror and the vertex of the secondary mirror is fixed at $d = 400$ mm.\n3.  The final image must be formed behind the primary mirror at a distance of $b = 150$ mm from its vertex. This distance, known as the back focal length, is necessary to accommodate the camera sensor and other optical components.\n\nAll light rays from distant astronomical objects are considered to be initially parallel to the principal axis of the telescope.
