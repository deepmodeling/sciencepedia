The illuminance on a surface from a point source is given by the formula:\n$$E = \\frac{I \\cos(\\theta)}{r^2}$$\nwhere $I$ is the luminous intensity of the source, $r$ is the distance from the source to the point on the surface, and $\\theta$ is the angle of incidence, which is the angle between the light ray and the normal to the surface.\n\nLet the light source be at a height $h$ directly above the center of the circular table. The surface of the table is horizontal, so the normal to the surface is vertical. For any point on the table at a horizontal distance $x$ from the center, the distance $r$ from the source to this point can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n$$r^2 = h^2 + x^2 \\implies r = \\sqrt{h^2 + x^2}$$\nThe angle of incidence $\\theta$ is the angle between the vertical normal and the line connecting the source to the point. From the geometry of the right triangle formed by the height $h$, the horizontal distance $x$, and the light ray path $r$, we have:\n$$\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{adjacent}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} = \\frac{h}{r} = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{h^2 + x^2}}$$\nSubstituting $r$ and $\\cos(\\theta)$ into the illuminance formula, we get the illuminance as a function of $h$ and $x$:\n$$E(h, x) = \\frac{Ih}{(h^2 + x^2)^{3/2}}$$\nThe illuminance is a decreasing function of the distance from the center, $x$. Therefore, the minimum illuminance on the table surface will occur at the edge, where $x=R$. The condition that the illuminance must be at least $E_{\\text{min}}$ everywhere on the table is satisfied if the illuminance at the edge, $E_{\\text{edge}}$, is at least $E_{\\text{min}}$.\nThe illuminance at the edge is:\n$$E_{\\text{edge}}(h) = \\frac{Ih}{(h^2 + R^2)^{3/2}}$$\nThe problem states that the engineer places the source at the height $h_{\\text{opt}}$ that maximizes this edge illuminance. To find this optimal height, we need to find the maximum of $E_{\\text{edge}}(h)$ with respect to $h$. Since $I$ and $R$ are positive constants, we only need to maximize the function $f(h) = \\frac{h}{(h^2 + R^2)^{3/2}}$. We do this by taking the derivative with respect to $h$ and setting it to zero.\n\nUsing the quotient rule $\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right)' = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$:\nLet $u = h$ and $v = (h^2 + R^2)^{3/2}$.\n$u' = 1$.\n$v' = \\frac{3}{2}(h^2 + R^2)^{1/2} \\cdot (2h) = 3h(h^2 + R^2)^{1/2}$.\n\n$$f'(h) = \\frac{1 \\cdot (h^2 + R^2)^{3/2} - h \\cdot 3h(h^2 + R^2)^{1/2}}{((h^2 + R^2)^{3/2})^2}$$\nSetting $f'(h) = 0$ requires the numerator to be zero:\n$$(h^2 + R^2)^{3/2} - 3h^2(h^2 + R^2)^{1/2} = 0$$\nWe can factor out $(h^2 + R^2)^{1/2}$ (which is always non-zero for $h>0$):\n$$(h^2 + R^2)^{1/2} \\left[ (h^2 + R^2) - 3h^2 \\right] = 0$$\n$$h^2 + R^2 - 3h^2 = 0$$\n$$R^2 - 2h^2 = 0$$\n$$h^2 = \\frac{R^2}{2} \\implies h = \\frac{R}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nThis is the optimal height, $h_{\\text{opt}}$, that maximizes the illuminance at the edge.\n\nNow, we substitute this optimal height back into the expression for $E_{\\text{edge}}$ to find the maximum possible illuminance at the edge for a given intensity $I$.\n$$E_{\\text{edge, max}} = \\frac{I h_{\\text{opt}}}{(h_{\\text{opt}}^2 + R^2)^{3/2}} = \\frac{I (R/\\sqrt{2})}{((R^2/2) + R^2)^{3/2}}$$\n$$E_{\\text{edge, max}} = \\frac{IR/\\sqrt{2}}{(3R^2/2)^{3/2}} = \\frac{IR/\\sqrt{2}}{(3/2)^{3/2} (R^2)^{3/2}} = \\frac{IR/\\sqrt{2}}{(3\\sqrt{3})/(2\\sqrt{2}) \\cdot R^3}$$\n$$E_{\\text{edge, max}} = \\frac{IR}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3\\sqrt{3}R^3} = \\frac{2I}{3\\sqrt{3}R^2}$$\nTo meet the requirement, this maximum possible edge illuminance must be at least $E_{\\text{min}}$.
