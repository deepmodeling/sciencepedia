The design uses a single thin convex lens to focus sunlight onto a high-efficiency photovoltaic cell. We can model the sun as an object at an infinite distance from the lens, so a sharp image is formed at the lens's focal plane where the cell is placed.\n\nThe manufacturer of the photovoltaic cell specifies that for optimal performance, the numerical aperture (NA) of the cone of light incident on the cell must not exceed a maximum value of $NA_{max} = 0.240$. The entire system operates in air, which can be assumed to have a refractive index of $n_{air} = 1.00$.\n\nThe student's objective is to achieve the highest possible power density (irradiance) on the surface of the cell. This is accomplished by using the \"fastest\" lens available that meets the manufacturer's NA specification. A faster lens is one with a smaller f-number (also known as the f-ratio).\n\nTwo lenses are available for the prototype:\n- Lens A: Diameter $D_A = 4.50$ cm, Focal length $f_A = 10.0$ cm.\n- Lens B: Diameter $D_B = 6.00$ cm, Focal length $f_B = 15.0$ cm.\n\nDetermine the f-number of the optimal lens for this application.
