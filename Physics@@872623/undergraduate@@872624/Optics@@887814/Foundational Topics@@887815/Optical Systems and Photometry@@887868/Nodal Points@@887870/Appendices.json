Therefore, our task is to find the locations of the principal points. We can determine these locations, $p_1 = \\overline{V_1H_1}$ and $p_2 = \\overline{V_2H_2}$, by first calculating the effective focal length ($f$), the front focal length (FFL), and the back focal length (BFL).\n\nLet the principal axis be the z-axis, with the first vertex $V_1$ at $z=0$ and the second vertex $V_2$ at $z=d$.
