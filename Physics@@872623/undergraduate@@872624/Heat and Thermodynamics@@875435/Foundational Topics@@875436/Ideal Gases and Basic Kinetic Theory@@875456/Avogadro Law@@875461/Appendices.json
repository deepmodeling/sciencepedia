In its packed state, it is partially filled with $0.50$ moles of Neon gas, which can be treated as an ideal gas. This maintains a slight positive pressure and gives the module some initial structure. The internal temperature and pressure of the module are maintained at a constant level by an external environmental control system. To fully deploy the habitat for use, an additional $0.25$ moles of Neon are pumped into it from a high-pressure tank.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the final volume of the habitat to its initial volume.

We are given the initial number of moles of Neon gas, $n_i = 0.50$ moles, and the amount of gas added, $n_{add} = 0.25$ moles.\n\nThe problem states that Neon can be treated as an ideal gas. The relationship between pressure ($P$), volume ($V$), number of moles ($n$), and temperature ($T$) for an ideal gas is given by the Ideal Gas Law:\n$$PV = nRT$$\nwhere $R$ is the ideal gas constant.\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the volume:\n$$V = n \\left( \\frac{RT}{P} \\right)$$\nThe problem specifies that the internal temperature ($T$) and pressure ($P$) are kept constant throughout the process. The ideal gas constant $R$ is also a constant. Therefore, the entire term in the parentheses is constant. Let's call this constant $C = \\frac{RT}{P}$. The equation then simplifies to:\n$$V = C n$$\nThis shows that the volume $V$ is directly proportional to the number of moles $n$ when pressure and temperature are held constant. This principle is known as Avogadro's Law.\n\nFor the initial and final states of the habitat, we can write:\nInitial state: $V_i = C n_i$\nFinal state: $V_f = C n_f$\n\nWe want to find the ratio $\\frac{V_f}{V_i}$.

The result of their sum, $0.75$, has its last significant digit in the hundredths place, consistent with the input values. The division of $0.75$ (two significant figures) by $0.50$ (two significant figures) should result in an answer with two significant figures.
