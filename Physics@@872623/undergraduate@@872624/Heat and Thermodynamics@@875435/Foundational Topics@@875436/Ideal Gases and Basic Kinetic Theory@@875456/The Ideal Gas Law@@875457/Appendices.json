We are told to assume the gaseous $CO_2$ behaves as an ideal gas. The physical principle governing the state of the gas is the ideal gas law:\n$$PV = nRT$$\nHere, $P$ is the pressure of the gas, $V$ is the volume it occupies, $n$ is the number of moles of the gas, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature of the gas in Kelvin. Our goal is to find the volume, $V$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the values of the other variables in the ideal gas law using the information provided.\n\nThe bag is described as \"perfectly flexible,\" which implies that it expands until the pressure of the gas inside, $P$, equals the external ambient pressure, $P_{atm}$. Therefore, the pressure of the gas is:\n$$P = P_{atm} = 1.013 \\times 10^5 \\text{ Pa}$$\n\nThe temperature is given in degrees Celsius, $T_C = 25.0 ^\\circ\\text{C}$. The ideal gas law requires the temperature to be in Kelvin, $T_K$. The conversion is $T_K = T_C + 273.15$:\n$$T = 25.0 + 273.15 = 298.15 \\text{ K}$$\n\nNext, we need to find the number of moles, $n$, of $CO_2$. This can be calculated from the given mass, $m = 75.0 \\text{ g}$, and the molar mass of $CO_2$, which we must first calculate. The chemical formula for carbon dioxide is $CO_2$, so its molar mass, $M_{CO_2}$, is the sum of the molar mass of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.\n$$M_{CO_2} = M_C + 2 \\times M_O$$\nUsing the given values for the molar masses:\n$$M_{CO_2} = 12.01 \\text{ g/mol} + 2 \\times (16.00 \\text{ g/mol}) = 12.01 + 32.00 = 44.01 \\text{ g/mol}$$\nNow we can calculate the number of moles:\n$$n = \\frac{m}{M_{CO_2}} = \\frac{75.0 \\text{ g}}{44.01 \\text{ g/mol}} \\approx 1.704158 \\text{ mol}$$\n\nThe ideal gas constant, $R$, is given as $8.314 \\text{ J/(mol}\\cdot\\text{K)}$.\n\nNow we have all the necessary components to find the volume $V$.
