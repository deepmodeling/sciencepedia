The container is designed for a specific industrial process and must be stored at a low temperature before use. A crucial safety parameter is the temperature at which the internal pressure of the gas would equalize with the surrounding environment. Assuming the surrounding environment is at standard atmospheric pressure, denoted by $P_0$, determine the temperature of the gas at which this pressure equalization occurs. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $P_0$, $V$, $n$, and the universal gas constant, $R$.", "solution": "Because the gas is ideal and contained in a rigid, sealed container, the amount of substance $n$ and volume $V$ remain constant.
