The problem specifies the final temperature change $\\Delta T$, not the amount of heat added. While it would take a different amount of heat to raise the temperature of Nitrogen by $\\Delta T$ compared to Helium ($Q_{N_2} > Q_{He}$ because $C_{V, N_2} > C_{V, He}$), the final state is determined only by $n$, $V$, and $T_f$. Since these quantities are the same for both containers, their final pressures must also be the same.\n\nComparing the expressions for the final pressures, we see that they are identical.\n$$P_{f, A} = P_{f, B}$$\n\nTherefore, the ratio is:\n$$\\frac{P_{f, B}}{P_{f, A}} = \\frac{\\frac{n R (T_i + \\Delta T)}{V}}{\\frac{n R (T_i + \\Delta T)}{V}} = 1$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "1863477"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice moves beyond static \"before-and-after\" scenarios to the dynamic world of thermodynamics, where quantities change over time.
