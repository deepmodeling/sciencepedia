During operation, the chip can be modeled as a simple resistor that dissipates a constant electrical power, $P$. To prevent overheating, the chip is submerged in a large, thermally insulated dewar containing liquid nitrogen, which is held at its constant boiling point, $T_{boil}$. The volume of liquid nitrogen is substantial enough that it acts as an ideal heat bath, meaning its temperature does not change as it absorbs heat.

This practice explores the consequences of this finitude by asking for the maximum work that can be extracted from a system where the 'reservoir' is a block of material with a finite heat capacity. It challenges us to apply the first law of thermodynamics to the entire isolated system to connect the total change in internal energy to the work performed.

The principle of maximum work states that the work output is maximized when the process is reversible. For the composite system, which is thermally isolated from its surroundings, a reversible process requires that all parts of the system are in internal equilibrium at all times. This means the gas and the heat source must always be at the same temperature throughout the process. Let this common, time-varying temperature be $T$.\n\nThe combined system (gas + heat source) is thermally isolated, so it does not exchange heat with the outside world ($Q_{ext} = 0$). According to the First Law of Thermodynamics, the change in the total internal energy of an isolated system is equal to the negative of the work done by the system on its surroundings.\n$$W_{max} = - \\Delta U_{total}$$\nThe total internal energy, $U_{total}$, is the sum of the internal energy of the heat source, $U_{res}$, and the internal energy of the gas, $U_{gas}$.\n$$U_{total} = U_{res} + U_{gas}$$\nTherefore, the total change in internal energy is:\n$$\\Delta U_{total} = \\Delta U_{res} + \\Delta U_{gas}$$\nThe process starts with both components at an initial temperature $T_0$. To maximize the work extracted, the process should continue until the final temperature reaches the lowest permissible value. The problem states this is $T_f = T_0(1-\\eta)$.\n\nLet's calculate the change in internal energy for each component.\n\nFirst, for the heat source (reservoir):\nThe change in internal energy of the reservoir is related to its heat capacity $C$ and the change in its temperature.\n$$\\Delta U_{res} = C \\Delta T = C (T_f - T_0)$$\n\nSecond, for the gas:\nThe gas is specified as a monatomic ideal gas. The internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on its temperature. The molar heat capacity at constant volume for a monatomic ideal gas is $C_{V,m} = \\frac{3}{2}R$.
