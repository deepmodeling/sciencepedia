This exercise focuses on this critical skill by examining a chemical reaction within a sealed container. By analyzing how the container's properties (its walls) affect energy exchange, you will practice distinguishing between a closed system, which can exchange energy but not matter, and an isolated system, which can exchange neither. [@problem_id:1901156]", "problem": "An effervescent antacid tablet, which releases carbon dioxide gas upon reacting with water, is dropped into a vertical cylinder containing water. The cylinder is sealed from the top by a frictionless, movable piston. The system is defined as the contents within the cylinder (the water, the tablet, and any gases produced). Initially, this system is in thermal and mechanical equilibrium with the surroundings, which are at a constant atmospheric pressure $P_{atm}$ and temperature $T_{surr}$. After the tablet is added, the chemical reaction begins, producing gas and causing the piston to move.\n\nConsider the following two distinct scenarios for the properties of the cylinder and piston:\n\n**Scenario I**: The cylinder and piston are constructed from a perfect thermal insulator (adiabatic walls).\n\n**Scenario II**: The cylinder and piston are constructed from a perfect thermal conductor (diathermal walls), and the reaction and subsequent expansion occur slowly enough that the system's temperature remains equal to $T_{surr}$ at all times.\n\nFor each scenario, classify the thermodynamic system *during the process* in which the reaction occurs and the piston moves.

The boundary is the inner surface of the cylinder and the movable piston. The cylinder is sealed, so no material can cross the system boundary during the process. Therefore, mass conservation across the boundary implies\n$$\\dot{m}_{\\text{in}}=\\dot{m}_{\\text{out}}=0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\Delta m=0,$$\nwhich is the defining condition for a closed system (no mass transfer).\n\nScenario I (adiabatic walls): The walls and piston are perfect thermal insulators, so there is no heat transfer,\n$$\\delta Q=0.$$\nThe piston is frictionless and movable, so boundary work occurs when the gas expands, $\\delta W = P_{\\text{ext}}\\,\\mathrm{d}V \\neq 0$ in general. Because energy crosses the boundary via work, the system is not isolated. Since $\\Delta m=0$, it is a closed system.\n\nScenario II (diathermal walls with quasi-static expansion at $T=T_{\\text{surr}}$): The walls and piston conduct heat perfectly, and the process is slow enough to maintain\n$$T(t)=T_{\\text{surr}} \\quad \\forall t,$$\nwhich generally requires nonzero heat exchange,\n$$\\delta Q \\neq 0.$$\nThe piston moves, so boundary work occurs, $\\delta W = P_{\\text{ext}}\\,\\mathrm{d}V \\neq 0$ in general.

The presence of heat and work transfer means it is not isolated.\n\nThus, in both scenarios the correct classification is closed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1901156"}, {"introduction": "Once a system is defined, the next step is to analyze the energy transfers across its boundary. This problem uses the familiar scenario of a blacksmith quenching a hot iron hook to explore the two main forms of energy transfer: heat and work. By defining the hook as a closed system, you will learn to identify the dominant form of energy exchange and understand why, in many common processes, one form of energy transfer is far more significant than the other. [@problem_id:1901173]", "problem": "A blacksmith forges a small, solid iron hook of mass $m$ and specific heat capacity $c_{iron}$. After heating it to a uniform temperature $T_{iron}$, the blacksmith plunges it into a large, insulated barrel containing water of mass $M$ and specific heat capacity $c_{water}$ at an initial temperature $T_{water}$, where $T_{iron} > T_{water}$. For the purposes of thermodynamic analysis, we define the iron hook as the \"system\" and everything else (the water, the barrel, the surrounding air, etc.) as the \"surroundings.\"\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate physical description of the iron hook (the system) and the primary energetic process that occurs immediately after it is submerged?\n\nA. The system is open, and it primarily gains energy from the surroundings via heat transfer.\nB. The system is isolated, because the total energy of the combined iron-water entity is conserved.\nC. The system is closed, and energy is transferred to the surroundings exclusively through work done by the system as it contracts.\nD. The system is closed, and the dominant form of energy transfer is heat flowing from the system to the surroundings.\nE. The system is open, and it primarily loses energy to the surroundings through work done on the water.", "solution": "We identify the thermodynamic system as the iron hook alone. By definition, a closed system can exchange energy but not mass with its surroundings, an open system can exchange both mass and energy, and an isolated system exchanges neither. Since the hook does not exchange mass with the water or the environment during submersion, the hook is a closed system.\n\nImmediately upon immersion, there is a temperature gradient with $T_{iron} > T_{water}$, so heat flows spontaneously from the hotter body (the iron hook) to the colder body (the water). For the closed system (the iron), the first law is $\\Delta U = Q + W$, where $Q$ is the heat added to the system and $W$ is the work done on the system. Because the iron is cooling, heat is transferred out, so $Q  0$. The value is approximately $Q \\approx m c_{iron} (T_{f} - T_{iron})$.\n\nMechanical work is also performed. As the solid hook contracts ($\\Delta V  0$), the surroundings do work *on* the system. This work is given by $W = - \\int p \\, dV \\approx -p \\Delta V$. Since $\\Delta V$ is negative, the work done on the system, $W$, is positive. However, the magnitude of this contraction work is very small compared to the heat released. The ratio of the magnitudes is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{|W|}{|Q|} \\approx \\frac{p V \\beta |\\Delta T|}{m c_{iron} |\\Delta T|} = \\frac{p \\beta}{\\rho c_{iron}},\n$$\nwhere $\\rho = m/V$ is the density of iron and $\\beta$ is the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient. For condensed matter at typical pressures, this ratio is much less than 1, so $|W| \\ll |Q|$. Therefore, the dominant energy transfer for the iron is heat flowing out to the surroundings.\n\nAlthough the barrel is insulated so that the combined iron-water entity is approximately isolated, the defined system is the iron hook only. The iron is not isolated because it exchanges heat with the water surroundings. It is also not open, since there is no mass exchange across the hook’s boundary.\n\nThus, the correct description is that the system is closed and the dominant form of energy transfer is heat flowing from the system to the surroundings.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1901173"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative analysis to quantitative problem-solving is a key progression in mastering thermodynamics. This problem challenges you to calculate the energy absorbed by a rising air bubble, which acts as a closed system undergoing a change in pressure and volume. To solve it, you must apply the First Law of Thermodynamics to an isothermal process, integrating concepts like the ideal gas law and hydrostatic pressure to find a concrete numerical answer for heat transfer. [@problem_id:1901194]", "problem": "A scuba diver exhales a small bubble of air at an initial depth $h_i$ below the surface of a large, calm lake. The bubble contains $n$ moles of air. The bubble then rises slowly towards the surface, reaching a final depth of $h_f$. The temperature of the lake water, $T_w$, is uniform at all depths. The atmospheric pressure at the surface is $P_{atm}$. The water has a constant density $\\rho_w$, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nAssume the air in the bubble behaves as an ideal gas and that the ascent is slow enough for the air to always be in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding water. Furthermore, you may neglect the effects of surface tension on the pressure inside the bubble.\n\nDetermine a symbolic expression for the total heat absorbed by the air in the bubble during its ascent from $h_i$ to $h_f$. Your expression should be in terms of $n$, $T_w$, $P_{atm}$, $\\rho_w$, $g$, $h_i$, $h_f$, and the molar gas constant $R$.", "solution": "At a depth $h$ below the surface, the hydrostatic pressure in the water is $P(h)=P_{atm}+\\rho_{w} g h$. Neglecting surface tension implies the bubble’s internal pressure equals the ambient hydrostatic pressure at its depth. The water temperature is uniform, and the ascent is slow enough that the gas in the bubble remains in thermal equilibrium with the water; thus the process for the gas is isothermal at $T_{w}$. The bubble contains a fixed amount $n$ of ideal gas, so it is a closed system.\n\nFor a quasi-static (reversible) isothermal process of an ideal gas, the change in internal energy is zero ($\\Delta U=0$). From the First Law, $\\Delta U = Q + W$, this means the heat absorbed, $Q$, is the negative of the work done on the system, $W$. As the bubble expands, it does work on the surroundings, so $W$ is negative and $Q$ is positive. The heat absorbed is equal to the work done *by* the system, which is $Q = -W = \\int_{i}^{f} P\\,dV$.\n\nUsing the ideal gas law, $V=n R T_{w}/P$, we can evaluate this integral by changing the integration variable to pressure.
