In this system, high-pressure gas enters a counter-flow heat exchanger, where it is pre-cooled by the cold, unliquefied gas returning from the throttling stage. The pre-cooled high-pressure gas then undergoes a throttling process (Joule-Thomson expansion), which causes a portion of the gas to condense into a liquid. This liquid is separated and collected, while the remaining cold vapor is routed back through the heat exchanger to cool the incoming high-pressure stream before exiting the apparatus. The entire system, which consists of the heat exchanger, the throttle valve, and the separator, is perfectly insulated from its surroundings, meaning there is no heat exchange with the environment.\n\nLet the specific enthalpy of the high-pressure gas entering the apparatus be denoted by $h_1$.
