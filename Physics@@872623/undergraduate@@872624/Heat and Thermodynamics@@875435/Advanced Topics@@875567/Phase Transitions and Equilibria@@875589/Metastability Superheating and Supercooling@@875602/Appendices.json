The core principle to apply is the conservation of energy for an isolated system. The heat released by the portion of water that freezes must equal the heat absorbed by the entire mass of water as it warms from its initial supercooled temperature to the final equilibrium temperature.\n\nFirst, let's identify the initial and final states of the system.\nThe initial state is the entire mass $M$ of water in a liquid state at a uniform temperature $T_i = -5.00^\\circ\\text{C}$.\nThe final state is a mixture of ice and liquid water. For pure water at standard pressure, a mixture of solid and liquid phases coexists at a single, constant temperature, which is the normal freezing point. Therefore, the final equilibrium temperature of the system is $T_f = 0^\\circ\\text{C}$.\n\nLet $m_{ice}$ be the mass of water that turns into ice. The fraction of water that freezes is $f = \\frac{m_{ice}}{M}$.\n\nThe process can be broken down into two components for the energy balance:\n1.  **Heat Released ($Q_{released}$):** When a mass $m_{ice}$ of water at $0^\\circ\\text{C}$ transitions from the liquid phase to the solid phase (ice), it releases an amount of heat determined by the specific latent heat of fusion, $L_f$.\n    $$Q_{released} = m_{ice} L_f$$\n    It's important to note that the latent heat is released during the phase change, which occurs at the freezing point, $T_f$.\n\n2.  **Heat Absorbed ($Q_{absorbed}$):** The heat released by the freezing process is absorbed by the *entire* initial mass $M$ of the supercooled water, warming it from the initial temperature $T_i$ to the final equilibrium temperature $T_f$. The amount of heat absorbed is given by the calorimetry equation:\n    $$Q_{absorbed} = M c_w \\Delta T$$\n    where $\\Delta T = T_f - T_i$.\n\nSince the system is assumed to be perfectly isolated, energy is conserved within the system. Therefore, the heat released must equal the heat absorbed:\n$$Q_{released} = Q_{absorbed}$$\n$$m_{ice} L_f = M c_w (T_f - T_i)$$\n\nWe are asked to find the fraction of water that freezes, $f = \\frac{m_{ice}}{M}$. We can rearrange the energy balance equation to solve for this fraction:\n$$\\frac{m_{ice}}{M} = \\frac{c_w (T_f - T_i)}{L_f}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given numerical values into this expression.\nThe given constants are:\n$c_w = 4.19 \\times 10^3 \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{kg}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{K}^{-1}$\n$L_f = 3.34 \\times 10^5 \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{kg}^{-1}$\nThe temperatures are:\n$T_i = -5.00^\\circ\\text{C}$\n$T_f = 0^\\circ\\text{C}$\n\nThe temperature change is $\\Delta T = T_f - T_i = 0^\\circ\\text{C} - (-5.00^\\circ\\text{C}) = 5.00^\\circ\\text{C}$.\nA temperature difference of $5.00^\\circ\\text{C}$ is equivalent to a temperature difference of $5.00 \\text{ K}$. Hence, we can directly use the value of $c_w$ given in units involving Kelvin.\n\nSubstituting these values into our expression for the fraction $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{(4.19 \\times 10^3 \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{kg}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{K}^{-1}) \\times (5.00 \\text{ K})}{3.34 \\times 10^5 \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{kg}^{-1}}$$\n\nThe units of J, kg, and K cancel out, leaving a dimensionless fraction, as expected.\n$$f = \\frac{4.19 \\times 5.00 \\times 10^3}{3.34 \\times 10^5}$$\n$$f = \\frac{20.95 \\times 10^3}{3.34 \\times 10^5}$$\n$$f = \\frac{20.95}{3.34} \\times 10^{3-5} = \\frac{20.95}{3.34} \\times 10^{-2}$$\n$$f \\approx 6.272455 \\times 10^{-2}$$\n$$f \\approx 0.06272455$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\nThe first three significant figures are 6, 2, and 7.
