This result is physically nonsensical and indicates a fundamental failure of the classical model at low energies, where quantum effects, neglected in the model, become dominant.\n\nYour task is to determine the precise temperature at which this breakdown is first signified by the entropy crossing into unphysical negative territory. Derive a closed-form analytical expression for this critical temperature, $T_c$, at which the classically calculated entropy of the gas is exactly zero.
