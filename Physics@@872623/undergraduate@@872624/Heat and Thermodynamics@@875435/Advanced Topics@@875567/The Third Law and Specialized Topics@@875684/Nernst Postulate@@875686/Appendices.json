The AN molecule has a very small electric dipole moment, and as the substance is cooled to form a crystal, the molecules arrange themselves on a lattice. At each lattice site, a molecule can align in one of two possible orientations (e.g., 'A-N' or 'N-A' along a crystal axis) with essentially identical energy. Due to kinetic freezing as the crystal cools, these orientations are randomly distributed throughout the solid, even as the temperature approaches absolute zero. This results in a non-zero entropy at 0 K. Calculate the residual molar entropy of this crystal. Provide your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of the universal gas constant, $R$.", "solution": "Each AN molecule at a lattice site has two indistinguishable-energy orientations, so the single-site degeneracy is $g=2$.
