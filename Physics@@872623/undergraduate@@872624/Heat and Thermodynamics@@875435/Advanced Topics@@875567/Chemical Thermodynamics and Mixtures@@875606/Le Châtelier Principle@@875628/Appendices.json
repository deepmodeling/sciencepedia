This first practice problem uses the vibrant, color-changing equilibrium of cobalt(II) complex ions in solution as a visual laboratory. By predicting how different disturbances—such as adding or removing chemical species or changing the temperature—affect the solution's color, you will build a strong, intuitive understanding of how chemical systems respond to stress [@problem_id:2002306].", "problem": "In an aqueous solution, the cobalt(II) ion exists in an equilibrium between two different complex ions, the hexaaquacobalt(II) ion, $[Co(H_2O)_6]^{2+}$, which is pink, and the tetrachlorocobaltate(II) ion, $[CoCl_4]^{2-}$, which is blue. The equilibrium is described by the following chemical equation:\n$$[Co(H_2O)_6]^{2+}(aq, \\text{pink}) + 4 Cl^-(aq) \\rightleftharpoons [CoCl_4]^{2-}(aq, \\text{blue}) + 6 H_2O(l)$$\nThe forward reaction as written is known to be endothermic. A solution is prepared by dissolving cobalt(II) chloride in water, resulting in a purple-colored solution at room temperature, indicating that significant amounts of both cobalt complexes are present.

Adding a large volume of distilled water.\n\nB. Adding a small amount of solid silver nitrate ($AgNO_3$).\n\nC. Placing the sample in an ice bath at 0 °C.\n\nD. Adding a few drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid ($HCl$).\n\nE. Dissolving a small amount of solid potassium nitrate ($KNO_3$).", "solution": "The question asks to identify which procedure will cause the equilibrium to shift in a direction that makes the solution more intensely blue. The blue-colored species is the tetrachlorocobaltate(II) ion, $[CoCl_4]^{2-}$, which is on the product side of the given reaction. Therefore, we need to find the procedure that shifts the equilibrium to the right. We will analyze each option using Le Châtelier's principle, which states that if a change of condition is applied to a system in equilibrium, the system will shift in a direction that counteracts the change.\n\nThe equilibrium reaction is:\n$$[Co(H_2O)_6]^{2+}(aq, \\text{pink}) + 4 Cl^-(aq) \\rightleftharpoons [CoCl_4]^{2-}(aq, \\text{blue}) + 6 H_2O(l) \\quad (\\Delta H  0)$$\n\n**Analysis of Option A: Adding a large volume of distilled water.**\nAdding water has two effects. First, it dilutes all the dissolved species ($[Co(H_2O)_6]^{2+}$, $Cl^-$, and $[CoCl_4]^{2-}$). The reactant side has $1+4=5$ moles of aqueous ions, while the product side has only 1 mole of aqueous ions. To counteract the overall decrease in concentration, the equilibrium will shift to the side with a greater number of dissolved particles, which is the left side. Second, water ($H_2O$) is a product in the reaction. Increasing the concentration of a product will cause the equilibrium to shift to the left to consume the added product. Both effects push the equilibrium to the left, favoring the formation of the pink $[Co(H_2O)_6]^{2+}$ ion. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option B: Adding a small amount of solid silver nitrate ($AgNO_3$).**\nSolid silver nitrate dissolves in the aqueous solution to produce silver ions ($Ag^+$) and nitrate ions ($NO_3^-$). The silver ions will react with the chloride ions ($Cl^-$) in the solution to form solid silver chloride ($AgCl$), which is insoluble and precipitates out. The net ionic reaction for the precipitation is $Ag^+(aq) + Cl^-(aq) \\rightarrow AgCl(s)$. This process removes chloride ions, a reactant in the main equilibrium, from the solution. According to Le Châtelier's principle, a decrease in the concentration of a reactant will cause the equilibrium to shift to the left to replenish the removed reactant. This shift favors the pink complex. Thus, option B is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option C: Placing the sample in an ice bath at 0 °C.**\nPlacing the sample in an ice bath lowers the temperature of the system. The problem states that the forward reaction is endothermic, meaning it absorbs heat ($\\Delta H  0$). Consequently, the reverse reaction is exothermic (releases heat, $\\Delta H  0$). According to Le Châtelier's principle, if the temperature is decreased, the equilibrium will shift in the exothermic direction to produce heat and counteract the cooling. Therefore, the equilibrium will shift to the left, favoring the formation of the pink $[Co(H_2O)_6]^{2+}$ ion. Thus, option C is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option D: Adding a few drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid ($HCl$).**\nHydrochloric acid is a strong acid that fully dissociates in water, providing a high concentration of hydrogen ions ($H^+$) and chloride ions ($Cl^-$). The addition of concentrated $HCl$ significantly increases the concentration of $Cl^-$ in the system. Chloride ion is a reactant in the equilibrium. According to Le Châtelier's principle, an increase in the concentration of a reactant will cause the equilibrium to shift to the right to consume the added reactant. This shift favors the formation of the products, including the blue $[CoCl_4]^{2-}$ ion. Thus, option D is correct.\n\n**Analysis of Option E: Dissolving a small amount of solid potassium nitrate ($KNO_3$).**\nSolid potassium nitrate dissolves to yield potassium ions ($K^+$) and nitrate ions ($NO_3^-$). Neither of these ions participates directly in the cobalt complex equilibrium. They are spectator ions. Their addition does not significantly change the concentrations of the reacting species or the temperature. Therefore, adding potassium nitrate will not cause a significant shift in the equilibrium position. The color of the solution will remain largely unchanged. Thus, option E is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis of all options, only the addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid will shift the equilibrium to the right and cause the solution to become more intensely blue.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2002306"}, {"introduction": "Now let's focus specifically on the effect of temperature. In this problem, we will treat heat as a reactant or product to predict how equilibrium shifts.

Because $K \\approx s^{2}$ for this $1{:}1$ electrolyte under the stated approximations, an increase in $K$ implies an increase in $s$. Equivalently, by Le Châtelier's principle, for an endothermic dissolution, increasing temperature (adding heat) shifts the equilibrium toward the products, increasing the extent of dissolution and thus the molar solubility.\n\nTherefore, when temperature increases, the molar solubility increases because the equilibrium shifts to favor the products.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2002283"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative predictions to quantitative analysis, this final exercise demonstrates the power of Le Châtelier's principle in a more rigorous context.
