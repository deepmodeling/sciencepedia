This exercise hones a core skill in materials science: interpreting microstructural evidence to classify an alloy's composition relative to its eutectic point. By observing the primary phases that form upon cooling, you can deduce whether an alloy is hypoeutectic or hypereutectic, a critical first step in understanding its properties [@problem_id:1285095].", "problem": "A materials engineering student is tasked with analyzing a newly developed binary alloy of Tin (Sn) and Bismuth (Bi), which is known to form a simple eutectic system.

The eutectic point occurs at a composition of 58 wt% Bi and a temperature of $138\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$, where the liquid phase transforms directly into a solid mixture of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n\nThe student melts a sample of the alloy and then cools it slowly to room temperature. A metallographic analysis of the resulting solid reveals a microstructure consisting of large, blocky, primary crystals of the $\\beta$ phase, which are surrounded by a fine, alternating lamellar (plate-like) structure composed of both $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ phases.\n\nBased on this microstructural observation, which of the following statements correctly categorizes the alloy?\n\nA. The alloy is hypoeutectic because the microstructure contains primary crystals.\n\nB. The alloy is hypereutectic because primary $\\beta$ phase is observed.\n\nC.

On further cooling to $T_{E}$, the remaining liquid undergoes $L \\to \\alpha + \\beta$ and forms a fine eutectic (typically lamellar) mixture in the interdendritic or interstitial regions around the primary $\\alpha$.\n- If $C_{0}>C_{E}$ (hypereutectic, to the Bi-rich side), the first solid to form is primary $\\beta$. On reaching $T_{E}$, the remaining liquid transforms via $L \\to \\alpha + \\beta$, producing the eutectic lamellar mixture surrounding the primary $\\beta$.\n- If $C_{0}=C_{E}$ (exact eutectic), no primary phase appears; the entire microstructure is the fine eutectic $\\alpha+\\beta$ mixture without blocky primary crystals.\n\nThe observed microstructure consists of large, blocky primary $\\beta$ crystals surrounded by a fine lamellar $\\alpha+\\beta$ eutectic.
