This first practice exercise is a conceptual check on one of the most fundamental consequences of the Gibbs-Duhem equation. By analyzing a hypothetical experimental claim, you will use the equation to reason about the linked behavior of chemical potentials in a mixture, reinforcing the idea that component properties are not independent [@problem_id:1864239].", "problem": "A chemical engineering student is investigating the thermodynamic properties of a binary liquid mixture of two components, labeled 1 and 2. The system is maintained at a constant temperature $T$ and constant pressure $P$. Starting with an equimolar mixture, where the mole fraction of each component is 0.5, the student adds an infinitesimal amount of pure component 1 to the mixture. After the system re-equilibrates, they claim to have measured a small increase in the chemical potential of component 1, denoted $\\mu_1$, and also a small increase in the chemical potential of component 2, denoted $\\mu_2$. This reported observation is, in fact, physically impossible.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct thermodynamic reasoning for why this experimental claim must be false?\n\nA. At constant temperature and pressure, the chemical potentials are fixed by the composition. Adding more of component 1 dilutes component 2, which must cause the chemical potential of component 2 to decrease, not increase.\n\nB. For a system at constant temperature and pressure, the chemical potentials of the components are thermodynamically linked. If the amount of one component is increased, its chemical potential increases, which necessitates that the chemical potential of the other component must decrease.\n\nC. According to the second law of thermodynamics, the total entropy must increase upon mixing. An increase in both chemical potentials would lead to a decrease in the overall entropy of the mixture, which is a violation of this law.\n\nD. The student's observation is correct but incomplete. The increase in both chemical potentials is an unstable transient state, and a spontaneous phase separation must follow to lower the total Gibbs free energy.\n\nE. At constant temperature and pressure, the chemical potential of any component in a mixture depends only on its own mole fraction. Therefore, adding component 1 should not have caused any change in the chemical potential of component 2.", "solution": "We consider a single-phase binary mixture at fixed temperature $T$ and pressure $P$. Let $G(T,P,n_{1},n_{2})$ be the Gibbs free energy, with chemical potentials defined as $\\mu_{i}=\\left(\\partial G/\\partial n_{i}\\right)_{T,P,n_{j\\neq i}}$. The fundamental differential for $G$ is\n$$\ndG=-S\\,dT+V\\,dP+\\mu_{1}\\,dn_{1}+\\mu_{2}\\,dn_{2}.\n$$\nBecause $G$ is a first-degree homogeneous function of the extensive variables $\\{n_{i}\\}$, Euler’s theorem gives\n$$\nG=n_{1}\\mu_{1}+n_{2}\\mu_{2}.\n$$\nDifferentiating this identity yields\n$$\ndG=\\mu_{1}\\,dn_{1}+\\mu_{2}\\,dn_{2}+n_{1}\\,d\\mu_{1}+n_{2}\\,d\\mu_{2}.\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for $dG$ and canceling the common $\\mu_{i}\\,dn_{i}$ terms gives the Gibbs–Duhem equation:\n$$\n-S\\,dT+V\\,dP=n_{1}\\,d\\mu_{1}+n_{2}\\,d\\mu_{2}.\n$$\nAt fixed $T$ and $P$, $dT=0$ and $dP=0$, so\n$$\nn_{1}\\,d\\mu_{1}+n_{2}\\,d\\mu_{2}=0.\n$$\nDividing by the total moles $n=n_{1}+n_{2}$ gives the mole-fraction form\n$$\nx_{1}\\,d\\mu_{1}+x_{2}\\,d\\mu_{2}=0.\n$$\nSince $x_{1}>0$ and $x_{2}>0$ in a single-phase binary mixture, this identity requires that $d\\mu_{1}$ and $d\\mu_{2}$ cannot both be positive (nor both negative) unless both are zero. Therefore, after adding an infinitesimal amount of component 1 at constant $T$ and $P$, if $\\mu_{1}$ increases (so $d\\mu_{1}>0$), the Gibbs–Duhem relation demands $d\\mu_{2}0$. The student’s report that both $\\mu_{1}$ and $\\mu_{2}$ increased is thus thermodynamically impossible.\n\nAmong the options, the statement that correctly captures this thermodynamic constraint is that, at constant $T$ and $P$, the chemical potentials are linked so that an increase in one necessitates a decrease in the other.
