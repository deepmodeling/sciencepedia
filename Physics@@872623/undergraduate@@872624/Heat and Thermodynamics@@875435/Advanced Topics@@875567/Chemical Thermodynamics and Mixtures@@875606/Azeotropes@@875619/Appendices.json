Therefore, the system forms a minimum-boiling azeotrope.\n\nAt an azeotrope, the equilibrium vapor and liquid compositions are identical, i.e.,\n$$y_{E}^{\\text{az}}=x_{E}^{\\text{az}},\\qquad y_{F}^{\\text{az}}=x_{F}^{\\text{az}},\\qquad x_{E}^{\\text{az}}+x_{F}^{\\text{az}}=1.$$\nIn fractional distillation at a given pressure, the species or mixture with the lowest boiling temperature is the most volatile and preferentially appears at the top of an efficient column. For a minimum-boiling azeotrope, the azeotrope itself is the most volatile “pseudo-component,” having the smallest boiling temperature $T_{\\text{az}}$. Consequently, the initial distillate from a well-functioning fractionating column at standard pressure will have the azeotropic composition.\n\nEliminating the other options:\n- Maximum-boiling statements are incompatible with $T_{\\text{az}}T_{b,E}$ and $T_{\\text{az}}T_{b,F}$, so options B and E are false.\n- The initial distillate cannot be pure Evolene or pure Fumaron in the presence of a minimum-boiling azeotrope acting as the most volatile composition, so options C and D are false.\n- The existence of an azeotrope prevents complete separation into pure components at the same pressure by a single fractional distillation, so option F is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the system forms a minimum-boiling azeotrope and the initial distillate collected will have the azeotropic composition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1982371"}, {"introduction": "The existence of an azeotrope creates what is known as a 'distillation boundary,' fundamentally limiting the separation achievable in a single distillation column.

For a maximum-boiling azeotrope, the boiling temperature $T(x_{A})$ has a local maximum at $x_{A,z}$, implying that the azeotrope is the least volatile composition: its equilibrium vapor pressure is at a local minimum relative to neighboring compositions. In fractional distillation, the less volatile composition accumulates in the reboiler (bottoms), while the more volatile species is enriched in the vapor and hence in the distillate.\n\nWith an ideal column having an infinite number of theoretical plates, the rectifying section can, for any feed composition, drive the top composition to the pure, more volatile component that is stable on that side of the azeotrope, while the bottoms composition approaches the least volatile node, here the maximum-boiling azeotrope.\n\nFor compositions to the left of the azeotrope, $x_{A}x_{A,z}$, the relative volatility satisfies $\\alpha_{AB}1$, i.e., $K_{B}K_{A}$, so the vapor is enriched in component $B$ (water).

For compositions to the right of the azeotrope, $x_{A}x_{A,z}$, the relative volatility satisfies $\\alpha_{AB}1$, i.e., $K_{A}K_{B}$, so the vapor is enriched in component $A$ (nitric acid), and with infinite stages the distillate approaches $y_{A}\\to 1$, i.e., pure nitric acid, while the bottoms again approach the azeotrope.\n\nTherefore, for Mix 1 ($x_{A,1}x_{A,z}$), the distillate is pure water, and for Mix 2 ($x_{A,2}x_{A,z}$), the distillate is pure nitric acid.
