This exercise presents a thought experiment that beautifully illustrates the First Law of Thermodynamics, showing how the macroscopic potential energy of an object is ultimately converted into its internal thermal energy. By analyzing this inelastic process, you will gain a deeper intuition for the principle of energy conservation in its broadest sense. [@problem_id:1846712]", "problem": "A solid spherical ball of mass $m$, with a specific heat capacity $c$, is part of a materials science experiment. The ball is placed inside a tall, vertical, cylindrical container that has been evacuated to a vacuum and is perfectly thermally insulated. The ball is released from rest at an initial height $H$ above the rigid base of the container. The collision between the ball and the base is inelastic, characterized by a coefficient of restitution $e$, where $0 < e < 1$. The ball bounces repeatedly until it comes to a complete rest on the container's base. Assume that any mechanical energy lost during the collisions is entirely converted into the internal thermal energy of the ball, leading to a uniform temperature increase. The interaction with the residual gas in the vacuum is negligible, and no energy is transferred to the container. Determine the total change in the temperature of the ball, $\\Delta T$, after it has come to rest. Express your answer in terms of the acceleration due to gravity $g$, and the parameters $H$ and $c$.", "solution": "The container is perfectly insulated and evacuated, so the only mechanism for mechanical energy loss is the inelastic collision with the rigid base. Between collisions, motion under gravity is conservative, so mechanical energy is conserved during flight and only decreases at impact. By assumption, all mechanical energy lost in each collision is converted into the ball’s internal energy.\n\nLet $h_{0}=H$ be the initial drop height. Just before the first impact, the kinetic energy is $K_{0}=m g h_{0}$. With coefficient of restitution $e$ against a rigid base, the speed immediately after impact is reduced by a factor $e$, so the retained kinetic energy fraction is $e^{2}$. Therefore, the energy lost (and converted to internal energy) in that collision is\n$$\n\\Delta Q_{0}=(1-e^{2})\\,K_{0}=(1-e^{2})\\,m g h_{0}.\n$$\nAfter rebounding, the ball rises to height $h_{1}=e^{2} h_{0}$. It then falls from $h_{1}$ to the base for the second collision, with pre-impact kinetic energy $K_{1}=m g h_{1}$. The loss at this collision is\n$$\n\\Delta Q_{1}=(1-e^{2})\\,m g h_{1}=(1-e^{2})\\,m g \\,e^{2} H.\n$$\nIterating, if $h_{i}=e^{2 i} H$ is the fall height before the $i$-th collision, then the energy lost at that collision is\n$$\n\\Delta Q_{i}=(1-e^{2})\\,m g h_{i}=(1-e^{2})\\,m g \\,e^{2 i} H,\\quad i=0,1,2,\\dots\n$$\nThe total internal energy gained by the ball after all bounces is the convergent geometric series (since $0<e<1$):\n$$\nQ=\\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty}\\Delta Q_{i}=(1-e^{2})\\,m g H\\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} e^{2 i}=(1-e^{2})\\,m g H\\cdot \\frac{1}{1-e^{2}}=m g H.\n$$\nHence, the total thermal energy gained equals the initial gravitational potential energy, consistent with energy conservation and the final state at rest on the base. With specific heat capacity $c$ (assumed constant), the uniform temperature rise is\n$$\n\\Delta T=\\frac{Q}{m c}=\\frac{m g H}{m c}=\\frac{g H}{c}.\n$$\nThis result is independent of $e$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{g H}{c}}$$", "id": "1846712"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principle of energy conservation, we now turn to a classic calorimetry problem involving a phase change.
