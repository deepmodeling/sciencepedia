The behavior of Helium II can be effectively described by the \"two-fluid model\". According to this model, the liquid behaves as if it were a mixture of two interpenetrating fluid components:\n1.  A **superfluid component**, which has zero viscosity and, most importantly, zero entropy.\n2.  A **normal fluid component**, which behaves like a classical viscous fluid and carries the entire entropy and thermal energy of the liquid.\n\nThe relative concentration of these two components depends on the temperature; at absolute zero, the liquid is 100% superfluid, and at $T_{\\lambda}$, it is 100% normal fluid.\n\nConsider a large, thermally insulated reservoir containing Helium II at an initial equilibrium temperature $T_{i}$, where $0  T_{i}  T_{\\lambda}$. An external pressure is applied to force a small amount of the liquid from this reservoir through a thermally insulating, extremely narrow capillary tube known as a \"superleak\".

Let the total mass density be $\\rho=\\rho_{s}+\\rho_{n}$, where $\\rho_{s}$ and $\\rho_{n}$ are the superfluid and normal densities, respectively. The superfluid component has zero viscosity and zero entropy; the normal component carries all the entropy. Denote the velocities of the two components by $\\mathbf{v}_{s}$ and $\\mathbf{v}_{n}$.\n\nA superleak is a porous medium or ultranarrow capillary that blocks the viscous normal component while allowing the inviscid superfluid to flow. Thus, through the superleak,\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_{n}\\approx \\mathbf{0}, \\quad \\mathbf{v}_{s}\\neq \\mathbf{0}.\n$$\nIn the two-fluid hydrodynamics, entropy is carried entirely by the normal component. If $s$ is the specific entropy (entropy per unit mass), the entropy per unit volume is $\\rho s$.

Consequently, the mass transferred into the receiving container carries zero entropy: the specific entropy of the inflowing fluid is $\\sigma=S/M=0$.\n\nConsider the entropy balance for the receiving container, which is thermally insulated and initially empty. Let $S_{2}$ be its total entropy and $M_{2}$ its mass. Because the only inflow is superfluid with zero entropy, and there is no heat exchange with the surroundings, the entropy inflow rate is zero, and there is no internal viscous dissipation associated with the superfluid flow. Hence\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}S_{2}}{\\mathrm{d}t}=0\n$$\nduring the filling, and since $S_{2}(t=0)=0$, it follows that\n$$\nS_{2}(t)=0\n$$\nat all times, in particular at the final internal equilibrium. Thus the collected fluid in the receiving container has total entropy $S_{2}=0$.\n\nFor Helium II in equilibrium, the entropy as a function of temperature satisfies $S(T)0$ for $0TT_{\\lambda}$, and $S(0)=0$ because all thermal excitations (phonons/rotons) are absent only at $T=0$. Using the thermodynamic definition\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T}=\\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial U}\\right)_{N,V},\n$$\nthe only equilibrium state with $S=0$ is the ground state at $T=0$. Therefore, ideally, the collected liquid equilibrates to $T_{f}=0$, which in particular implies $T_{f}T_{i}$ for any $0T_{i}T_{\\lambda}$.\n\nThis conclusion can also be seen from the fountain-effect thermodynamic identity for Helium II,\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\mu = -s\\,\\mathrm{d}T + \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\,\\mathrm{d}p,\n$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the chemical potential per unit mass, and $s$ is the specific entropy (entropy per unit mass). In steady superleak conditions where $\\mu$ tends to equalize via superfluid flow and the normal component is clamped, a pressure difference produces a temperature difference of opposite sign proportional to $s$. Since the transmitted component has $s=0$, the receiving side is driven to lower $T$. This is the same “entropy filtration” reasoning: the superleak passes the zero-entropy superfluid, effectively removing thermal excitations.\n\nNow we evaluate the options:\n\n- A is incorrect: while external work is done to push the fluid, the superfluid flow is dissipationless, and this work does not convert into heat in the receiving container; it changes chemical potential and pressure without viscous heating.\n- B is incorrect: viscous friction pertains to the normal component, which is blocked in the superleak; the superfluid has zero viscosity.\n- C is incorrect: thermal insulation prevents heat exchange with the surroundings, but does not force both subsystems to remain at the same temperature; selective mass transport with zero entropy changes the temperatures internally.\n- D is correct: the superleak preferentially transmits the zero-entropy superfluid component, so the collected liquid has lower temperature; ideally, it approaches $T_{f}=0$.\n- E is incorrect: the cooling observed is not a Joule-Thomson throttling of a normal fluid but the consequence of entropy filtration by the superleak; the JT analogy does not capture the dominant physics in Helium II superflow.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is that $T_{f}T_{i}$ because the superleak passes only the zero-entropy superfluid, effectively filtering out thermal energy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1886058"}, {"introduction": "The unique properties of He II give rise to spectacular macroscopic effects, such as the thermomechanical or 'fountain' effect.
