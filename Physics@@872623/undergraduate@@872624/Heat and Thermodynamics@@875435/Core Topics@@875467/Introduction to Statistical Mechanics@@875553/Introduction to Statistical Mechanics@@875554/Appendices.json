An Einstein solid is a collection of identical, independent quantum harmonic oscillators. The total energy of a solid with $N$ oscillators is quantized and given by $U=q\\epsilon$, where $q$ is a non-negative integer representing the number of energy quanta and $\\epsilon$ is the fundamental energy quantum. The multiplicity of a microstate (the number of ways to distribute $q$ quanta among $N$ oscillators) is given by the formula $\\Omega(N, q) = \\binom{q+N-1}{q}$.\n\nLet's denote the two clusters as Cluster A and Cluster B.
