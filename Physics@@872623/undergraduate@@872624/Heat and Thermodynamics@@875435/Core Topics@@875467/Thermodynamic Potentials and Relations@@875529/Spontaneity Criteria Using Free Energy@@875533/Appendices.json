The block is placed inside a sealed, rigid, and diathermal container of a fixed total internal volume $V$. The container is then fully submerged in a large thermal reservoir that is maintained at a constant temperature $T$. The temperature $T$ is above the sublimation point of CO₂. The system of interest is defined as the contents within the container.\n\nThe spontaneity of a process can be determined by analyzing the change in a specific thermodynamic potential, provided the experimental conditions match the natural variables of that potential. The four fundamental thermodynamic potentials are the internal energy ($U$), enthalpy ($H$), Helmholtz free energy ($A$), and Gibbs free energy ($G$).\n\nGiven the experimental setup described, which of the following statements correctly identifies the most convenient thermodynamic potential for determining the spontaneity of the sublimation process and provides the correct justification?\n\nA. The Gibbs free energy ($G$), because the process occurs at constant temperature and pressure.\n\nB. The Enthalpy ($H$), because sublimation is a phase transition, and the change in enthalpy dictates spontaneity.\n\nC.

The Helmholtz free energy ($A$), because the process occurs at constant temperature and constant volume.\n\nE. The Gibbs free energy ($G$), because phase transitions are always analyzed under constant temperature, and this is the most common potential for chemical reactions.", "solution": "Identify the experimental constraints from the setup:\n- The container is diathermal and immersed in a large thermal reservoir at temperature $T$, so the system is maintained at constant temperature $T$.\n- The container is rigid, so the system volume is constant, $V=\\text{const}$.\n- The container is sealed, so the total amount of substance inside is fixed; for a single-component system (CO$_{2}$), $N=\\text{const}$, even though amounts in different phases may change. The pressure is not controlled and will generally change as sublimation proceeds.\n\nMatch constraints to the natural variables of the thermodynamic potentials:\n- The internal energy $U(S,V,N)$ has natural variables $S$, $V$, $N$; its differential is $dU=T\\,dS-P\\,dV+\\sum_{i}\\mu_{i}\\,dN_{i}$. The minimization principle for $U$ applies at fixed $S$, $V$, $N$, which does not match the present case because $T$ (not $S$) is controlled and heat exchange is allowed by the diathermal wall.\n- The enthalpy $H(S,P,N)$ has natural variables $S$, $P$, $N$; its differential is $dH=T\\,dS+V\\,dP+\\sum_{i}\\mu_{i}\\,dN_{i}$. The appropriate spontaneity criterion applies at fixed $S$, $P$, $N$, which does not match because $P$ is not fixed and $T$ is controlled rather than $S$.\n- The Helmholtz free energy $A(T,V,N)$ is defined by $A=U-TS$ with differential\n$$\ndA=dU-T\\,dS_{\\text{sys}}-S\\,dT=-S\\,dT-P\\,dV+\\sum_{i}\\mu_{i}\\,dN_{i}.\n$$\nIts natural variables are $T$, $V$, $N$.

Consider the closed system in thermal contact with a heat bath at temperature $T$ and assume only $PV$ work. The first and second laws give, for the system,\n$$\ndU=\\delta Q+\\delta W,\\quad \\delta W=-P\\,dV,\\quad dS_{\\text{sys}}\\ge \\frac{\\delta Q}{T}.\n$$\nFor a rigid container, $dV=0$, so $\\delta W=0$ and $dU=\\delta Q$. The Helmholtz free energy change is\n$$\ndA=dU-T\\,dS_{\\text{sys}}=\\delta Q-T\\,dS_{\\text{sys}}\\le 0,\n$$\nwith equality only at reversible equilibrium. Equivalently, using the reservoir’s entropy change $dS_{\\text{res}}=-\\delta Q/T$, the total entropy change is $dS_{\\text{tot}}=dS_{\\text{sys}}+dS_{\\text{res}}\\ge 0$, and\n$$\ndA=-T\\,dS_{\\text{tot}}\\le 0,\n$$\nsince $T0$. Thus, at fixed $T$, $V$, and $N$, the Helmholtz free energy decreases for any spontaneous process and is minimized at equilibrium.\n\nEliminate the incorrect options explicitly:\n- A is incorrect because the pressure is not held constant in a sealed, rigid container; therefore $G$ is not the convenient potential.\n- B is incorrect because enthalpy change alone does not determine spontaneity; moreover, $H$ is appropriate for fixed $S$ and $P$, which are not the constraints here.\n- C is incorrect because a diathermal wall allows heat exchange; maintaining constant $T$ requires heat flow during sublimation, so $U$ is not the governing potential for spontaneity.\n- E is incorrect because, although phase transitions are often discussed at constant $T$ and $P$ using $G$, here $P$ is not controlled; the correct match to the constraints is the Helmholtz free energy $A$.\n\nTherefore, the most convenient thermodynamic potential is the Helmholtz free energy $A$, justified by the fixed $T$ and $V$ conditions with a closed system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1988987"}, {"introduction": "Having established how to choose the correct potential, we now focus on the most common scenario in chemistry and biology: processes occurring at constant temperature and pressure.
