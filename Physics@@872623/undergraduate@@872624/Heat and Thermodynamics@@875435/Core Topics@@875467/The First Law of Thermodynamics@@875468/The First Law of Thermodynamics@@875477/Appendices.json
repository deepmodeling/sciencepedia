The gas is heated by an external source, causing it to expand slowly against a constant external pressure, which allows the process to be considered isobaric (constant pressure). During this expansion, a total amount of heat $Q$ is supplied to the gas. Determine an expression for the work $W$ done by the gas on the piston during this process. Your answer should be expressed solely in terms of the heat $Q$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the work $W$ done *by* the gas. For a constant pressure (isobaric) process, this work is given by $W = \\int P\\,dV = P\\Delta V$. For an ideal gas, the ideal gas law $PV=nRT$ at constant pressure gives $P\\Delta V = nR\\Delta T$.
