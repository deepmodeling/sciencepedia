Therefore, the claim exceeds the maximum efficiency allowed by the second law of thermodynamics and is impossible for any engine operating between these two temperatures.\n\nThis does not violate the first law (energy conservation) per se; rather, it violates the second law constraint on heat-to-work conversion between given reservoirs. The evaluation does not depend on the working substance or materials, as Carnot's theorem is universal for all engines between fixed reservoirs.\n\nHence, the most accurate assessment is that no heat engine between $500$ K and $300$ K can have efficiency greater than the Carnot efficiency, so the claim is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1855742"}, {"introduction": "Once we understand the limits of efficiency, the next logical step is to explore how to maximize it within those limits.
