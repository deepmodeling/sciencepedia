This first practice invites you to act as a consultant evaluating a novel heating device. By applying the Clausius inequality to a claimed cycle, you can determine if it complies with the second law of thermodynamics, providing a definitive verdict on its scientific possibility without needing to build a prototype [@problem_id:1848856].", "problem": "An engineering startup claims to have designed a novel \"Geothermal Passive Heating Unit\". The device is purported to maintain a room's interior temperature at a constant $25.0^\\circ\\text{C}$ by cyclically extracting heat from a geothermal spring that is at a stable temperature of $15.0^\\circ\\text{C}$. A key feature of their marketing is the claim that this process is achieved without any external work input, meaning the device simply facilitates heat transfer from the colder spring to the warmer room.\n\nAs a consultant, you must evaluate the thermodynamic feasibility of this device. For your calculations, you may assume the room and the spring act as thermal reservoirs. All temperatures must be converted to Kelvin by adding 273.15 to the Celsius values.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly assesses the feasibility of the proposed device?\n\nA. The device is feasible because the total energy transfer, considering the heat from the spring and the heat delivered to the room, is conserved.\nB. The device is feasible, but only if it operates on a perfectly reversible cycle.\nC. The device is infeasible because it violates the First Law of Thermodynamics, as work must be done to create heat.\nD. The device is infeasible because the cyclic integral of $\\frac{\\delta Q}{T}$ for the proposed cycle is positive, which violates the Clausius inequality.\nE. The device is infeasible because the cyclic integral of $\\frac{\\delta Q}{T}$ is negative, implying an irreversible process that cannot be sustained without work.", "solution": "Convert the stated reservoir temperatures to Kelvin as required. Let the hot reservoir (the room) be at \n$$T_{h}=25.0+273.15\\ \\text{K},$$\nand the cold reservoir (the spring) be at \n$$T_{c}=15.0+273.15\\ \\text{K}.$$\nThus $T_{h}T_{c}$.\n\nModel the device as a cyclic system exchanging heat with two thermal reservoirs and, per the claim, performing no work. Denote by $Q_{c}0$ the heat absorbed by the device from the cold reservoir at $T_{c}$ and by $Q_{h}$ the heat absorbed by the device from the hot reservoir at $T_{h}$. Because the device is claimed to deliver heat to the room, heat flows from the device to the hot reservoir, so the heat absorbed by the device from the hot reservoir is negative: $Q_{h}0$. Energy conservation (First Law) over a complete cycle with no work input ($W=0$) requires that the net heat absorbed by the device over a cycle is zero:\n$$Q_{c}+Q_{h}=0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad Q_{h}=-Q_{c}.$$\n\nApply the Clausius inequality for any cyclic device:\n$$\\oint \\frac{\\delta Q}{T}\\leq 0,$$\nwith equality only for a reversible cycle. For a device exchanging heat only with two reservoirs, this becomes\n$$\\frac{Q_{h}}{T_{h}}+\\frac{Q_{c}}{T_{c}}\\leq 0.$$\nUsing $Q_{h}=-Q_{c}$ from the no-work energy balance,\n$$\\frac{-Q_{c}}{T_{h}}+\\frac{Q_{c}}{T_{c}}=Q_{c}\\left(\\frac{1}{T_{c}}-\\frac{1}{T_{h}}\\right).$$\nSince $T_{h}T_{c}$, we have $\\frac{1}{T_{c}}-\\frac{1}{T_{h}}0$, and with $Q_{c}0$ it follows that\n$$\\oint \\frac{\\delta Q}{T}=Q_{c}\\left(\\frac{1}{T_{c}}-\\frac{1}{T_{h}}\\right)0.$$\nThis strictly positive value violates the Clausius inequality, which demands that the cyclic integral be less than or equal to zero. Therefore, the proposed device is thermodynamically infeasible.\n\nNow assess the options:\n- A is incorrect: the First Law alone (energy conservation) can be satisfied with $W=0$ and $Q_{h}=-Q_{c}$, but feasibility is ruled out by the Second Law.\n- B is incorrect: even a perfectly reversible device transporting heat from cold to hot requires nonzero work; without work, it still violates the Clausius inequality.\n- C is incorrect: the First Law is not violated; it is the Second Law that forbids the process.\n- D is correct: the cyclic integral $\\oint \\delta Q/T$ is positive, violating the Clausius inequality.\n- E is incorrect: a negative cyclic integral does not violate the Clausius inequality; it indicates an irreversible but allowed process. The proposed device would require a positive integral, which is forbidden.\n\nHence the correct assessment is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1848856"}, {"introduction": "Thermodynamic cycles can involve both reversible and irreversible steps.
