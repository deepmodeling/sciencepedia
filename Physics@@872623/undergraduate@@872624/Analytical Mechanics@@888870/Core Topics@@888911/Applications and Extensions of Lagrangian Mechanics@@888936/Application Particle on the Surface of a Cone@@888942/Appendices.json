At the release point, choose the unit tangent $\\hat{t}$ along the line of steepest descent on the cone’s surface. For a right circular cone of half-angle $\\alpha$ (the angle between the axis and the slant surface), the generator (meridian) direction makes an angle $\\alpha$ with the vertical. The component of the gravitational force tangential to the surface, along the line of steepest descent, will drive the acceleration.\n\nOn a smooth frictionless surface, the normal reaction $\\vec{N}$ is perpendicular to the surface and hence does not contribute to the acceleration along the surface. Newton’s second law is $m\\vec{a}=\\vec{N}+m\\vec{g}$. We are interested in the component of acceleration tangent to the surface. This is caused by the tangential component of the gravitational force.\n\nThe angle between the vertical gravitational force vector and the slant surface is $90^\\circ - \\alpha$. Therefore, the component of the gravitational force vector *along* the slant surface (line of steepest descent) has a magnitude of $mg \\cos(90^\\circ - \\alpha) = mg \\sin\\alpha$.\nWait, let's re-check the geometry. If $\\alpha$ is the angle between the axis and the slant surface, then the angle the slant surface makes with the vertical is $\\alpha$.

The vector $\\vec{g}$ points vertically down. The tangent vector $\\hat{t}$ points down the slope, making an angle $\\alpha$ with the vertical direction. Thus, $\\vec{g} \\cdot \\hat{t} = |\\vec{g}| |\\hat{t}| \\cos\\alpha = g \\cos\\alpha$.\nSo, the tangential acceleration is:\n$$a_t = g\\cos\\alpha$$\nSince the particle starts from rest, its initial velocity is zero, so there is no centripetal acceleration component.
