The motion of the platform can be described by the equation for simple harmonic motion:\n$$y(t) = A \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)$$\nwhere $A$ is the amplitude, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $\\phi$ is the phase constant. The choice of sine or cosine, or the value of $\\phi$, does not affect the final result, as we are concerned with the maximum acceleration. For simplicity, we can let $\\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, so the motion is described by $y(t) = A\\cos(\\omega t)$.\n\nThe vertical velocity of the platform is the first time derivative of the position:\n$$v_y(t) = \\frac{dy}{dt} = -A\\omega \\sin(\\omega t)$$\n\nThe vertical acceleration of the platform is the second time derivative of the position:\n$$a_y(t) = \\frac{dv_y}{dt} = -A\\omega^2 \\cos(\\omega t)$$\n\nNow, let's analyze the forces acting on the sensor of mass $m$. There are two vertical forces: the gravitational force, $F_g = mg$, acting downwards, and the normal force, $N$, exerted by the platform on the sensor, acting upwards.\n\nAccording to Newton's second law, the net force on the sensor equals its mass times its acceleration. The sensor moves with the platform, so its acceleration is $a_y(t)$.\n$$F_{net, y} = N - mg = ma_y(t)$$\n\nFrom this equation, we can express the normal force as a function of time:\n$$N(t) = mg + ma_y(t) = m(g + a_y(t))$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for the acceleration $a_y(t)$:\n$$N(t) = m(g - A\\omega^2 \\cos(\\omega t))$$\n\nThe sensor remains in contact with the platform as long as the platform is pushing up on it, which means the normal force must be non-negative, $N(t) \\ge 0$. If $N(t)$ becomes zero, the sensor will be momentarily in a state of free fall and lose contact with the platform. Thus, the condition for the sensor not to lose contact is:\n$$m(g - A\\omega^2 \\cos(\\omega t)) \\ge 0$$\n\nSince the mass $m$ is positive, we can simplify this to:\n$$g - A\\omega^2 \\cos(\\omega t) \\ge 0$$\nwhich means\n$$g \\ge A\\omega^2 \\cos(\\omega t)$$\n\nThis inequality must hold for all times $t$. To find the most restrictive condition on the amplitude $A$, we must consider the maximum possible value of the term $A\\omega^2 \\cos(\\omega t)$. The maximum value of $\\cos(\\omega t)$ is 1, which occurs at the highest point of the oscillation ($y=+A$). At this point, the platform has its maximum downward acceleration.\n\nSo, the condition becomes:\n$$g \\ge A\\omega^2 (1)$$\n$$A \\le \\frac{g}{\\omega^2}$$\n\nThe maximum amplitude, $A_{max}$, for which the sensor does not lose contact corresponds to the equality:\n$$A_{max} = \\frac{g}{\\omega^2}$$\n\nThe problem provides the frequency $f$. The angular frequency $\\omega$ is related to $f$ by $\\omega = 2\\pi f$. Substituting this into the expression for $A_{max}$:\n$$A_{max} = \\frac{g}{(2\\pi f)^2}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given numerical values: $g = 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2$ and $f = 15.0 \\, \\text{Hz}$.\n$$A_{max} = \\frac{9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2}{(2\\pi \\times 15.0 \\, \\text{s}^{-1})^2} = \\frac{9.81}{(30.0\\pi)^2} \\, \\text{m}$$\n$$A_{max} = \\frac{9.81}{900\\pi^2} \\, \\text{m}$$\n\nUsing the value of $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$:\n$$A_{max} \\approx \\frac{9.81}{900 \\times (3.14159)^2} \\, \\text{m} \\approx \\frac{9.81}{8882.64} \\, \\text{m}$$\n$$A_{max} \\approx 0.0011044 \\, \\text{m}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be expressed in millimeters (mm).

The rod moves in the xy-plane.\n\n**1. Geometry and Generalized Coordinate**\n\nThe state of the rod can be described by a single generalized coordinate. Let's choose the angle $\\phi$ that the line connecting the origin to the rod's Center of Mass (CM) makes with the negative y-axis (the vertical downward direction). The stable equilibrium position corresponds to $\\phi = 0$.\n\nLet the two ends of the rod be $P_1$ and $P_2$. The CM of the rod is at its midpoint, C. The distance from the center of the bowl (origin O) to the CM (C) is constant. Consider the triangle formed by O, C, and one end of the rod, say $P_1$. This is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at C. The hypotenuse $OP_1$ is the radius $R$, and the leg $CP_1$ has length $L/2$. The distance $d$ of the CM from the origin is therefore:\n$$d = |\\vec{OC}| = \\sqrt{R^2 - (L/2)^2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{4R^2 - L^2}$$\nThe CM of the rod thus moves on a circle of radius $d$.\n\n**2.

The vertical position of the CM, $y_C$, can be expressed in terms of $\\phi$:\n$$y_C = -d \\cos(\\phi)$$\nThe potential energy $U$ is then:\n$$U(\\phi) = Mgy_C = -Mgd \\cos(\\phi)$$\nFor small oscillations, we are interested in the potential energy expanded around the equilibrium position $\\phi=0$. We expand $U(\\phi)$ as a Taylor series:\n$$U(\\phi) = U(0) + U'(0)\\phi + \\frac{1}{2}U''(0)\\phi^2 + \\dots$$\nThe first derivative is $U'(\\phi) = Mgd \\sin(\\phi)$.

Since the vertical direction is perpendicular to the horizontal direction, the angle the rod makes with the horizontal, $\\theta$, is equal to the angle $\\phi$ that OC makes with the vertical.
