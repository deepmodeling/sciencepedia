Each pendulum consists of a bob of mass $m$ attached to a massless, inextensible string of length $L$. The pendulums are suspended from two closely-spaced, fixed support points and are constrained to oscillate in the same vertical plane. A massless, horizontal spring with a small spring constant $k$ connects the two bobs. When both pendulums hang vertically at rest, the spring is unstretched. The system is subject to a uniform gravitational field with acceleration $g$. Assume all oscillations are of small amplitude.\n\nAt time $t=0$, the first pendulum is displaced by a small horizontal distance $A$ and is released from rest. Simultaneously, the second pendulum is at its vertical equilibrium position ($x=0$) and is also at rest. Due to the coupling, the energy of oscillation will slowly transfer from the first pendulum to the second, and then back again. This phenomenon is known as beating.\n\nDerive an expression for the period of these beats, $T_{\\text{beat}}$, which is defined as the time interval between successive moments when the first pendulum has all the system's oscillatory energy. You should work in the weak coupling limit, where the restoring force from the spring is much smaller than that from gravity.
