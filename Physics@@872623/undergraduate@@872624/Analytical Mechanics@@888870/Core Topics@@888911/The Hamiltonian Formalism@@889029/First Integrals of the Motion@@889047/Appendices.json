The bottom of the chamber is an infinitely large, perfectly flat surface that lies in the $xy$-plane. This surface interacts with the particle, creating a potential energy field. Due to the uniformity and infinite extent of the surface, the potential energy $V$ of the particle depends only on its vertical distance $z$ from the surface, and not on its lateral position $(x, y)$.
