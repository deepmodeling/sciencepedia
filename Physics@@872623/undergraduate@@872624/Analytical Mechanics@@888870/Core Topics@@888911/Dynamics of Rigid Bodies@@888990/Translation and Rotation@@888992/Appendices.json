Intuition often suggests the sphere, with its natural ability to roll, should win easily. This practice, however, introduces a critical twist: the inclines are frictionless.

Which of the following statements correctly describes the outcome of this race?\n\nA. The sphere reaches the bottom first.\n\nB. The cube reaches the bottom first.\n\nC. They reach the bottom at the same time.\n\nD. The outcome depends on their mass $M$; the more massive object would win if they had different masses.\n\nE. The outcome depends on the angle of the incline; the sphere wins for shallow angles and the cube wins for steep angles.", "solution": "Because the inclines are frictionless, there is no tangential contact force. Consequently, neither body acquires rotation from the contact: for the sphere, the normal force at the point of contact passes through its center, producing zero torque; for the cube resting with a face parallel to the plane, the resultant normal force acts along the plane normal through the centroid of the contact area, which is colinear with the vector from the center of mass to the contact, so the net torque is also zero. Thus, both bodies undergo pure translation.\n\nLet the incline angle be $\\theta$ and the length of the incline be $s$. The forces along the plane are $M g \\sin\\theta$ for each body. By Newton's second law along the plane,\n$$\nM a = M g \\sin\\theta \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = g \\sin\\theta.\n$$\nThis acceleration $a$ is identical for both bodies and is independent of $M$ and of shape.\n\nThe vertical drop of each incline is $h$, so the geometric relation gives $s \\sin\\theta = h$, i.e.\n$$\ns = \\frac{h}{\\sin\\theta}.\n$$\nStarting from rest under constant acceleration $a$, the kinematic relation $s = \\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}$ yields\n$$\nt = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 s}{a}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\left(\\frac{h}{\\sin\\theta}\\right)}{g \\sin\\theta}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 h}{g \\sin^{2}\\theta}}.\n$$\nBecause both bodies share the same $\\theta$ and $h$, they have the same travel time $t$. Equivalently, by energy conservation without rotation, the final speeds are $v = \\sqrt{2 g h}$ for both, confirming identical translational dynamics.\n\nTherefore, they reach the bottom at the same time. The result does not depend on $M$ or on the angle for deciding a winner; the angle only sets the common time via $\\sin\\theta$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2094021"}, {"introduction": "In many real-world systems, translational and rotational motion are not independent but are coupled together.
