Torque-free rotational dynamics are described by Euler's equations in a coordinate system whose origin is at the CM and whose axes are the principal axes of inertia.\n\nFirst, we must find the center of mass of the L-shaped object. The total mass is $2M$. The first rod (along the x-axis) has its CM at $(L/2, 0, 0)$. The second rod (along the y-axis) has its CM at $(0, L/2, 0)$. The CM of the combined object is:\n$$ x_{CM} = \\frac{M(L/2) + M(0)}{2M} = \\frac{L}{4} $$\n$$ y_{CM} = \\frac{M(0) + M(L/2)}{2M} = \\frac{L}{4} $$\n$$ z_{CM} = 0 $$\nSo, the CM is at $\\vec{r}_{CM} = (\\frac{L}{4}, \\frac{L}{4}, 0)$ in the specified coordinate system.\n\nNext, we calculate the inertia tensor $\\mathbf{I}_{CM}$ about the center of mass.
