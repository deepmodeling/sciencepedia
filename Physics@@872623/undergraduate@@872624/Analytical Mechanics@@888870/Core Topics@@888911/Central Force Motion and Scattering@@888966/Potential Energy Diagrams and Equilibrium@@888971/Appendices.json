Instead of the conventional method of balancing force vectors, we will employ the more general and powerful approach of analyzing the system's total potential energy. This exercise [@problem_id:2073236] provides a clear, tangible demonstration of how the equilibrium condition emerges directly from finding the configuration where the potential energy function is stationary, i.e., where its derivative with respect to the system's coordinate is zero.", "problem": "A block of mass $m_1$ is placed on a smooth (frictionless) inclined plane that makes an angle $\\theta$ with the horizontal. A light, inextensible string is attached to this block, passes over a small, massless, and frictionless pulley at the upper end of the incline, and is attached to a second block of mass $m_2$ that hangs freely. The entire system is under the influence of a uniform gravitational field of strength $g$.\n\nBy analyzing the total potential energy of the two-block system as a function of its configuration, determine the specific value of the mass ratio $m_2/m_1$ that allows the system to remain in equilibrium.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we will express the total gravitational potential energy of the system as a function of a single coordinate and then find the condition for which this potential energy is stationary, which corresponds to mechanical equilibrium.\n\nLet's define a coordinate $x$ to describe the position of the system. Let $x$ be the distance block $m_1$ has moved *up* the incline from an arbitrary initial reference position, which we can set to $x=0$. Since the string is inextensible, if block $m_1$ moves a distance $x$ up the incline, block $m_2$ must move a distance $x$ vertically downwards.\n\nWe need to define the zero level for gravitational potential energy. It is convenient to set the potential energy of each block to be zero at its initial position ($x=0$).\n\nThe potential energy of block $m_1$, $U_1$, depends on its vertical height. When block $m_1$ moves a distance $x$ up the incline, its vertical height increases by $\\Delta h_1 = x \\sin(\\theta)$. The change in its potential energy is therefore:\n$$U_1(x) = m_1 g \\Delta h_1 = m_1 g x \\sin(\\theta)$$\n\nThe potential energy of block $m_2$, $U_2$, depends on its vertical height. When block $m_2$ moves a distance $x$ downwards, its vertical height changes by $\\Delta h_2 = -x$. The change in its potential energy is therefore:\n$$U_2(x) = m_2 g \\Delta h_2 = -m_2 g x$$\n\nThe total potential energy of the system, $U(x)$, is the sum of the potential energies of the two blocks:\n$$U(x) = U_1(x) + U_2(x) = m_1 g x \\sin(\\theta) - m_2 g x$$\n\nWe can factor out common terms to simplify the expression:\n$$U(x) = (m_1 \\sin(\\theta) - m_2) g x$$\n\nA system is in equilibrium when its potential energy is at an extremum (a minimum, maximum, or point of inflection). This condition is met when the derivative of the potential energy with respect to the generalized coordinate is zero. In our case, the system is in equilibrium when $\\frac{dU}{dx} = 0$.\n\nLet's compute the derivative of $U(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\\frac{dU}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ (m_1 \\sin(\\theta) - m_2) g x \\right]$$\n\nSince $m_1$, $m_2$, $\\theta$, and $g$ are all constants, the derivative simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{dU}{dx} = (m_1 \\sin(\\theta) - m_2) g$$\n\nFor the system to be in equilibrium, we set this derivative to zero:\n$$(m_1 \\sin(\\theta) - m_2) g = 0$$\n\nSince the gravitational acceleration $g$ is non-zero, the term in the parenthesis must be zero:\n$$m_1 \\sin(\\theta) - m_2 = 0$$\n\nSolving for $m_2$, we find the relationship between the masses for equilibrium:\n$$m_2 = m_1 \\sin(\\theta)$$\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $m_2/m_1$. We can find this by dividing both sides of the equation by $m_1$ (assuming $m_1 \\neq 0$):\n$$\\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\sin(\\theta)$$\nThis is the condition for equilibrium.
