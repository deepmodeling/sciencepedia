This first exercise asks you to determine the initial speed needed to launch a projectile to a specific, finite altitude, from which it will fall back to the planet. By applying the principle of conservation of mechanical energy, you will build a foundational understanding of the trade-off between initial kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy.

The planet has a mass $M$ and a radius $R$. The goal is to launch a pod of mass $m$ such that it just reaches a maximum altitude equal to the planet's radius before falling back to the surface. Assume the pod is launched from rest relative to the mass driver's mechanism at the planet's surface. Determine the initial speed, $v_0$, that must be imparted to the pod by the mass driver. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $M$, $R$, and the universal gravitational constant, $G$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the initial launch speed $v_0$ required for a pod to reach a maximum altitude of $h=R$ above the surface of a planet of mass $M$ and radius $R$. Since the planet is airless, we can neglect air resistance. The only force acting on the pod after it leaves the mass driver is the planet's gravitational force. Gravity is a conservative force, which means the total mechanical energy of the pod-planet system is conserved throughout the pod's trajectory.\n\nLet's define the total mechanical energy $E$ as the sum of the kinetic energy $K$ and the gravitational potential energy $U$. The gravitational potential energy of an object of mass $m$ at a distance $r$ from the center of a planet of mass $M$ is given by $U(r) = -\\frac{GMm}{r}$, where the potential energy is zero at an infinite distance. The kinetic energy is given by $K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$.\n\nThe total mechanical energy is conserved, so the energy at the initial point (the surface of the planet) must be equal to the energy at the final point (the maximum altitude).\n$$E_i = E_f$$\n$$K_i + U_i = K_f + U_f$$\n\nThe initial state (subscript $i$) is at the planet's surface.

At the maximum altitude, the pod's vertical velocity is momentarily zero, so its speed is $v_f = 0$. The distance from the center of the planet at this point is $r_f = R + h = R + R = 2R$. The final kinetic and potential energies are:\n$$K_f = \\frac{1}{2}m(0)^2 = 0$$\n$$U_f = -\\frac{GMm}{2R}$$\n\nNow, we set the initial total energy equal to the final total energy:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 - \\frac{GMm}{R} = 0 - \\frac{GMm}{2R}$$\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by the mass of the pod, $m$, which shows that the required launch speed is independent of the pod's mass.\n$$\\frac{1}{2}v_0^2 - \\frac{GM}{R} = -\\frac{GM}{2R}$$\n\nTo solve for $v_0$, we first isolate the $\\frac{1}{2}v_0^2$ term:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}v_0^2 = \\frac{GM}{R} - \\frac{GM}{2R}$$\n\nWe find a common denominator for the terms on the right-hand side:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}v_0^2 = \\frac{2GM}{2R} - \\frac{GM}{2R}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2}v_0^2 = \\frac{GM}{2R}$$\n\nNow, we solve for $v_0^2$ by multiplying both sides by 2:\n$$v_0^2 = \\frac{2GM}{2R} = \\frac{GM}{R}$$\n\nFinally, taking the square root of both sides gives the initial launch speed $v_0$:\n$$v_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R}}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R}}}$$", "id": "2055196"}, {"introduction": "Achieving escape velocity is not always the result of a single, instantaneous impulse; continuous propulsion is a more realistic scenario for many launch systems. This problem introduces an external, constant force that does work on a projectile as it travels through a railgun.
