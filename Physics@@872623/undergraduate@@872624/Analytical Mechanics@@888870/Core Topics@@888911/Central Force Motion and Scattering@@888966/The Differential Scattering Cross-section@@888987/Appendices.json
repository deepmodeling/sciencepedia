Your task is to determine the conditions under which the classic Rutherford formula applies and then use it to calculate a specific cross-section, linking theoretical limits to practical calculation.", "problem": "A beam of particles is directed at a stationary target. Each particle in the beam has mass $m$ and positive charge $+q$. The target is a solid, non-conducting sphere of radius $R$ which carries a total positive charge $+Q$ distributed uniformly throughout its volume. A particle approaching the target from a large distance has an initial kinetic energy $E_0$. The interaction between a particle and the target is purely electrostatic. The electrostatic constant in a vacuum is given by $k_e = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}}$, where $\\epsilon_{0}$ is the permittivity of free space.\n\nThe standard Rutherford scattering formula accurately describes the outcome of the collision only when the projectile particle does not penetrate the target sphere.

The electrostatic force between them is repulsive. According to Gauss's law, the electric field outside the uniformly charged sphere (for a radial distance $r \\ge R$) is identical to that of a point charge $+Q$ located at its center. The corresponding electrostatic potential energy of the projectile particle is $U(r) = \\frac{k_e q Q}{r}$ for $r \\ge R$.\n\nThe Rutherford scattering formula is derived based on this $1/r$ potential. Therefore, the formula is valid for a specific scattering event if and only if the projectile's trajectory remains entirely in the region where this potential applies, i.e., its distance of closest approach, $r_{min}$, satisfies $r_{min} \\ge R$. For the formula to be valid for all scattering events at a given energy $E_0$, this condition must hold for all possible impact parameters $b \\ge 0$.\n\nWe can find the relationship between $r_{min}$, $E_0$, and $b$ using the principles of conservation of energy and angular momentum. The initial kinetic energy is $E_0 = \\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2$, where $v_0$ is the initial velocity. The angular momentum of the projectile with respect to the center of the target is $L = m v_0 b = b \\sqrt{2mE_0}$, which is conserved.\n\nAt the distance of closest approach, $r_{min}$, the radial velocity of the particle is zero. The kinetic energy at this point is purely tangential, given by $\\frac{L^2}{2mr_{min}^2}$. The total energy conservation equation is:\n$$E_0 = K_{min} + U(r_{min}) = \\frac{L^2}{2mr_{min}^2} + U(r_{min})$$\nSubstituting $L^2 = 2mE_0 b^2$ and $U(r_{min}) = \\frac{k_e q Q}{r_{min}}$:\n$$E_0 = \\frac{2mE_0 b^2}{2mr_{min}^2} + \\frac{k_e q Q}{r_{min}} = \\frac{E_0 b^2}{r_{min}^2} + \\frac{k_e q Q}{r_{min}}$$\nTo find the most restrictive condition, we need to find the minimum possible value of $r_{min}$ for any given $E_0$. We can analyze $r_{min}$ as a function of $b$. The equation can be written as $E_0 r_{min}^2 - (k_e q Q) r_{min} - E_0 b^2 = 0$. Solving this quadratic equation for $r_{min}$ gives:\n$$r_{min}(b) = \\frac{k_e q Q + \\sqrt{(k_e q Q)^2 - 4(E_0)(-E_0 b^2)}}{2E_0} = \\frac{k_e q Q + \\sqrt{(k_e q Q)^2 + 4E_0^2 b^2}}{2E_0}$$\nLooking at this expression, $r_{min}(b)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $b^2$ (or $|b|$). Thus, the minimum value of $r_{min}$ occurs at the minimum possible impact parameter, $b=0$. This corresponds to a head-on collision.\nFor $b=0$, the closest approach distance is:\n$$r_{min, min} = r_{min}(0) = \\frac{k_e q Q + \\sqrt{(k_e q Q)^2}}{2E_0} = \\frac{2k_e q Q}{2E_0} = \\frac{k_e q Q}{E_0}$$\nFor the Rutherford formula to be applicable for all trajectories, this smallest possible distance of closest approach must be greater than or equal to the sphere's radius $R$:\n$$r_{min, min} \\ge R \\implies \\frac{k_e q Q}{E_0} \\ge R$$\nThis imposes an upper limit on the incident energy.

The interaction is described by the repulsive Coulomb potential, $U(r) = k/r$, where $k = q_1 q_2 / (4\\pi \\epsilon_0)$ is a positive constant. This is known as Rutherford scattering.

The interaction is characterized by the impact parameter, $b$, which is the perpendicular distance between the initial velocity vector of the particle and a parallel line passing through the center of the target sphere.\n\nA particle will scatter if and only if its impact parameter $b$ is less than or equal to the radius of the sphere, $R$. If $b \\le R$, the particle collides and is deflected. If $b > R$, the particle misses the sphere entirely and continues on its original path without deflection.\n\nThe total scattering cross-section, $\\sigma_{\\text{HS}}$, represents the effective area that the target presents to the incident beam for a scattering event to occur. For a hard sphere, this is simply the geometric cross-sectional area of the sphere. Any particle aimed at this area will scatter. This area is a circle of radius $R$.\n\nTherefore, the total scattering cross-section is:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{HS}} = \\pi R^2 $$\nThis expression depends only on the radius $R$ of the sphere and is completely independent of the incident particle's mass $m$ or kinetic energy $E$. Thus, we can say that $\\sigma_{\\text{HS}}$ is proportional to $E^0$.\n\n**Part 2: Rutherford Scattering**\n\nFor Rutherford scattering, the interaction is governed by the Coulomb potential $U(r) = k/r$.
