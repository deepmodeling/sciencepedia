A holonomic constraint is any relation that can be written as an equation among the coordinates and possibly time, namely $f(q_{1},\\dots,q_{n},t)=0$. A scleronomic constraint is time-independent, while a rheonomic constraint depends explicitly on time.\n\nInitially, the tray is horizontal and coincides with the plane $z=0$. The tray tilts about the $y$-axis by an angle $\\alpha(t)$, with $\\alpha(t)=\\Omega t$. The plane of the tray at time $t$ is obtained by rotating the plane $z=0$ about the $y$-axis by angle $\\alpha(t)$. The unit normal to the initial plane is $\\hat{k}=(0,0,1)$.

Since this relation involves only the coordinates and time (no velocities), it is holonomic.
