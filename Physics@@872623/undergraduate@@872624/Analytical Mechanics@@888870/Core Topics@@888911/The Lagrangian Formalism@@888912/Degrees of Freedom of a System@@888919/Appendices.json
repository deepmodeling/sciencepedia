This exercise challenges you to move from a qualitative to a quantitative understanding by parameterizing a system with generalized coordinates and then deriving the algebraic equations that constrain them.

A small bead is threaded onto the rod and is free to slide along its entire length.\n\nDetermine the total number of degrees of freedom for the combined system consisting of the rod and the bead. The final answer should be a single real number.", "solution": "Let the endpoint of the rod on the positive x-axis be at $(a,0)$ and the endpoint on the positive y-axis be at $(0,b)$ with $a>0$ and $b>0$. The rod is rigid with fixed length $L$, so the distance between its endpoints is fixed:\n$$\n(a-0)^{2}+(0-b)^{2}=L^{2} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a^{2}+b^{2}=L^{2}.\n$$\nThus, among the two variables $a$ and $b$, there is one holonomic constraint, leaving the rod itself with a single degree of freedom.\n\nIntroduce a bead that can slide along the rod. Define a generalized coordinate $s\\in[0,L]$ measuring the arclength from the x-axis contact point $(a,0)$ along the rod toward the y-axis contact point $(0,b)$. The bead’s position is then determined by\n$$\n(x_{b},y_{b})=(a,0)+\\frac{s}{L}\\big((0,b)-(a,0)\\big)=\\left(a\\left(1-\\frac{s}{L}\\right),\\frac{b s}{L}\\right).\n$$\nThis introduces one additional independent generalized coordinate $s$.\n\nTherefore, the full configuration of the system can be described by the three variables $(a,b,s)$ subject to the single holonomic constraint $a^{2}+b^{2}=L^{2}$.

This advanced exercise guides you through a systematic reduction of a three-dimensional rigid body's mobility, starting from its full six degrees of freedom. By methodically applying constraints related to orientation, contact, and the 'no-slip' condition, you will see how kinematic relationships can be as crucial as geometric ones in defining a system's true freedom of movement [@problem_id:2044810].", "problem": "A solid cylinder, C1, of radius $r$ is placed inside a much longer hollow cylinder, C0, of inner radius $R$. The hollow cylinder C0 is fixed in space, but is rotating about its central longitudinal axis with a given, time-dependent angular velocity $\\Omega(t)$. The solid cylinder C1 moves in such a way that its central axis always remains parallel to the fixed axis of C0. Furthermore, C1 is always in contact with the inner wall of C0 and rolls without slipping against it.\n\nDetermine the number of degrees of freedom for the solid cylinder C1.", "solution": "The number of degrees of freedom of a mechanical system is the number of independent generalized coordinates required to specify its configuration. We begin by considering the inner cylinder C1 as a free rigid body in three-dimensional space, which has 6 degrees of freedom: three for the position of its center of mass $(x, y, z)$ and three for its orientation (e.g., Euler angles). We will then systematically apply the constraints described in the problem to determine how many degrees of freedom are removed.\n\nLet's set up a coordinate system. Let the fixed axis of the hollow cylinder C0 be the $z$-axis of a Cartesian coordinate system.\n\nConstraint 1: The axis of cylinder C1 always remains parallel to the axis of C0 (the $z$-axis).\nA general orientation of a rigid body requires three coordinates. For C1, its axis of cylindrical symmetry being parallel to the $z$-axis means that its orientation is fixed, apart from rotation about its own symmetry axis. This imposes two constraints on the three orientation coordinates. For example, if we use Euler angles $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)$, this constraint is equivalent to setting $\\alpha=0$ and $\\beta=0$. This leaves only one rotational coordinate, which we can denote as $\\psi$, representing the rotation of C1 about its own axis.\nNumber of degrees of freedom so far: $6 - 2 = 4$. The configuration can be described by $(x, y, z, \\psi)$, where $(x,y,z)$ is the position of the center of C1.\n\nConstraint 2: Cylinder C1 is always in contact with the inner wall of C0.\nThe center of C1 is at $(x,y,z)$. Since its axis is parallel to the $z$-axis, the distance from the axis of C1 to the axis of C0 is $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. For the surfaces to be in contact, this distance must be equal to the difference in their radii, $R-r$.\nSo, we have the equation: $x^2 + y^2 = (R-r)^2$.\nThis is a holonomic constraint equation that relates the coordinates $x$ and $y$. Due to this constraint, the position of the axis of C1 in the $xy$-plane can be described by a single coordinate, for example, the angle $\\phi$ in a cylindrical coordinate system, where $x = (R-r)\\cos\\phi$ and $y = (R-r)\\sin\\phi$. This constraint removes one degree of freedom.\nNumber of degrees of freedom so far: $4 - 1 = 3$. The configuration can be described by $(\\phi, z, \\psi)$.\n\nConstraint 3: The inner cylinder C1 rolls without slipping on the inner surface of C0.\nThis condition means that the relative velocity of the two surfaces at the point of contact is zero. Mathematically, $\\vec{v}_{\\text{contact, C1}} = \\vec{v}_{\\text{contact, C0}}$.\n\nLet's first find the velocity of a point on the inner surface of the rotating outer cylinder C0. The contact point lies on a line from the $z$-axis through the center of C1. Thus, its angular position is also $\\phi$. The position vector of the contact point on C0 is $\\vec{P}_{\\text{contact}} = R\\cos\\phi\\ \\hat{i} + R\\sin\\phi\\ \\hat{j} + z_{\\text{contact}}\\ \\hat{k}$. The angular velocity of C0 is $\\vec{\\Omega} = \\Omega(t)\\hat{k}$. The velocity of the contact point on C0 is given by $\\vec{v}_{\\text{contact, C0}} = \\vec{\\Omega} \\times \\vec{P}_{\\text{contact}} = (\\Omega(t)\\hat{k}) \\times (R\\cos\\phi\\ \\hat{i} + R\\sin\\phi\\ \\hat{j})$.\n$\\vec{v}_{\\text{contact, C0}} = R\\Omega(t) (\\cos\\phi\\ \\hat{j} - \\sin\\phi\\ \\hat{i})$. Note that the velocity does not depend on the $z$ coordinate of the contact point.\n\nNext, we find the velocity of the contact point on the inner cylinder C1. This velocity is the sum of the velocity of the center of mass of C1, $\\vec{v}_{\\text{cm, C1}}$, and the velocity of the contact point relative to the center of mass, $\\vec{\\omega}_{\\text{C1}} \\times \\vec{r}_{\\text{contact/cm}}$.\nThe position of the center of mass of C1 is $\\vec{r}_{\\text{cm, C1}} = (R-r)\\cos\\phi\\ \\hat{i} + (R-r)\\sin\\phi\\ \\hat{j} + z\\ \\hat{k}$.\nIts velocity is $\\vec{v}_{\\text{cm, C1}} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\vec{r}_{\\text{cm, C1}} = (R-r)(-\\dot{\\phi}\\sin\\phi\\ \\hat{i} + \\dot{\\phi}\\cos\\phi\\ \\hat{j}) + \\dot{z}\\ \\hat{k}$.\nThe angular velocity of C1 about its own axis is $\\vec{\\omega}_{\\text{C1}} = \\dot{\\psi}\\hat{k}$ (since its axis is parallel to the $z$-axis).\nThe vector from the center of C1 to the contact point is directed from the axis of C1 towards the axis of C0, with magnitude $r$. Its direction in the $xy$-plane is along $-\\hat{e}_{\\rho}$, where $\\hat{e}_{\\rho}$ is the radial unit vector at angle $\\phi$. Thus, $\\vec{r}_{\\text{contact/cm}} = -r(\\cos\\phi\\ \\hat{i} + \\sin\\phi\\ \\hat{j})$. Let's recheck this. The vector from origin to C1's center is $(R-r)\\hat{e}_{\\rho}$. The vector from origin to contact point is $R\\hat{e}_{\\rho}$. So vector from C1's center to contact point is $R\\hat{e}_{\\rho} - (R-r)\\hat{e}_{\\rho} = r\\hat{e}_{\\rho} = r(\\cos\\phi\\ \\hat{i} + \\sin\\phi\\ \\hat{j})$.\nSo, $\\vec{\\omega}_{\\text{C1}} \\times \\vec{r}_{\\text{contact/cm}} = (\\dot{\\psi}\\hat{k}) \\times (r\\cos\\phi\\ \\hat{i} + r\\sin\\phi\\ \\hat{j}) = r\\dot{\\psi}(\\cos\\phi\\ \\hat{j} - \\sin\\phi\\ \\hat{i})$.\nThe total velocity of the contact point on C1 is:\n$\\vec{v}_{\\text{contact, C1}} = \\vec{v}_{\\text{cm, C1}} + \\vec{\\omega}_{\\text{C1}} \\times \\vec{r}_{\\text{contact/cm}}$\n$\\vec{v}_{\\text{contact, C1}} = [-(R-r)\\dot{\\phi}\\sin\\phi - r\\dot{\\psi}\\sin\\phi]\\hat{i} + [(R-r)\\dot{\\phi}\\cos\\phi + r\\dot{\\psi}\\cos\\phi]\\hat{j} + \\dot{z}\\hat{k}$.\n\nNow we equate the velocities: $\\vec{v}_{\\text{contact, C1}} = \\vec{v}_{\\text{contact, C0}}$.\n$[-(R-r)\\dot{\\phi}\\sin\\phi - r\\dot{\\psi}\\sin\\phi]\\hat{i} + [(R-r)\\dot{\\phi}\\cos\\phi + r\\dot{\\psi}\\cos\\phi]\\hat{j} + \\dot{z}\\hat{k} = -R\\Omega(t)\\sin\\phi\\ \\hat{i} + R\\Omega(t)\\cos\\phi\\ \\hat{j}$.\n\nEquating the vector components gives three scalar constraint equations:\n1. $\\hat{k}$-component: $\\dot{z} = 0$. This implies that $z$ is a constant. This is an integrable constraint ($z=z_0$), so it is holonomic. It removes one degree of freedom.\n2. $\\hat{i}$-component: $-(R-r)\\dot{\\phi}\\sin\\phi - r\\dot{\\psi}\\sin\\phi = -R\\Omega(t)\\sin\\phi$.\n   Dividing by $-\\sin\\phi$ (for $\\sin\\phi \\neq 0$), we get $(R-r)\\dot{\\phi} + r\\dot{\\psi} = R\\Omega(t)$.\n3. $\\hat{j}$-component: $(R-r)\\dot{\\phi}\\cos\\phi + r\\dot{\\psi}\\cos\\phi = R\\Omega(t)\\cos\\phi$.\n   Dividing by $\\cos\\phi$ (for $\\cos\\phi \\neq 0$), we get $(R-r)\\dot{\\phi} + r\\dot{\\psi} = R\\Omega(t)$.\n\nThe $\\hat{i}$ and $\\hat{j}$ components yield the same constraint equation on the generalized velocities:\n$(R-r)\\dot{\\phi} + r\\dot{\\psi} = R\\Omega(t)$.\nThis is a differential relation. To see if it is holonomic, we check if it can be integrated to a form $f(\\phi, \\psi, t) = \\text{constant}$.\nWe can write it as $(R-r)\\frac{d\\phi}{dt} + r\\frac{d\\psi}{dt} = R\\Omega(t)$.\nIntegrating with respect to time gives:\n$(R-r)\\phi + r\\psi = R\\int \\Omega(t)dt + C$, where $C$ is a constant of integration.\nSince $\\Omega(t)$ is a specified function of time, its integral is a known function of time. Let $\\Theta(t) = \\int\\Omega(t)dt$. The constraint is $(R-r)\\phi + r\\psi - R\\Theta(t) = C$. This is an equation relating the coordinates and time, so it is a rheonomic (time-dependent) holonomic constraint. It removes one more degree of freedom.\n\nLet's recount the constraints:\n- Initial state: 6 DoF (free rigid body).\n- Constraint 1 (Parallel axes): -2 DoF.\n- Constraint 2 (Contact): -1 DoF.\n- Constraint 3 (No slip): Gave two independent equations:\n    - $\\dot{z}=0$: -1 DoF.\n    - $(R-r)\\dot{\\phi} + r\\dot{\\psi} = R\\Omega(t)$: -1 DoF.\n\nTotal reduction in DoF = $2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5$.\nThe final number of degrees of freedom is $6 - 5 = 1$. The entire state of the inner cylinder can be described by a single generalized coordinate (for example, $\\phi$), since $z$ is constant and $\\psi$ is determined by $\\phi$ and $t$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2044810"}]}
