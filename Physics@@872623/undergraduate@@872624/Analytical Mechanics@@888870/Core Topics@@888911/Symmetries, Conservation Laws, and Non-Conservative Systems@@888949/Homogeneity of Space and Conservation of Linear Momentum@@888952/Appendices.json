Neither the x-component, $P_x$, nor the y-component, $P_y$, are conserved.", "solution": "The conservation of a component of the total linear momentum is deeply connected to the symmetries of the system's Lagrangian. According to Noether's theorem, if the Lagrangian is invariant under a continuous spatial translation along a certain direction, then the component of the total linear momentum along that direction is a conserved quantity. This invariance is what is meant by the space being \"homogeneous\" with respect to the system's dynamics. We will test the given Lagrangian for invariance under translations in the x and y directions.\n\nLet the given Lagrangian be $L = T - V$, where the kinetic energy is $T = \\frac{1}{2}m(\\dot{x}_1^2 + \\dot{y}_1^2 + \\dot{x}_2^2 + \\dot{y}_2^2)$ and the potential energy is $V = k(x_1^2 + y_2^2)$.\n\n**Step 1: Test for conservation of the x-component of total momentum ($P_x$)**\n\nTo check if $P_x$ is conserved, we test for the system's invariance under a translation along the x-axis. This means we apply the same displacement $\\delta x$ to both particles:\n$x_1 \\rightarrow x_1' = x_1 + \\delta x$\n$x_2 \\rightarrow x_2' = x_2 + \\delta x$\nThe y-coordinates $y_1$ and $y_2$ remain unchanged.\n\nThe velocities are derivatives with respect to time, so $\\dot{x}_1' = \\dot{x}_1$ and $\\dot{x}_2' = \\dot{x}_2$. Thus, the kinetic energy term $T$ is unchanged by this transformation.\nNow, let's examine the potential energy term $V$:\n$V' = k((x_1')^2 + y_2^2) = k((x_1 + \\delta x)^2 + y_2^2) = k(x_1^2 + 2x_1\\delta x + (\\delta x)^2 + y_2^2)$\nThe change in the potential energy is $\\delta V = V' - V = k(2x_1\\delta x + (\\delta x)^2)$. For an infinitesimal translation, we consider the first-order term: $\\delta V \\approx 2kx_1\\delta x$.\nSince the potential energy $V$ changes, the Lagrangian $L = T - V$ also changes ($\\delta L = -\\delta V$). The Lagrangian is not invariant under a global translation in the x-direction. Therefore, the x-component of the total linear momentum, $P_x$, is not conserved.\n\n**Step 2: Test for conservation of the y-component of total momentum ($P_y$)**\n\nTo check if $P_y$ is conserved, we test for invariance under a translation along the y-axis. We apply a displacement $\\delta y$ to both particles:\n$y_1 \\rightarrow y_1' = y_1 + \\delta y$\n$y_2 \\rightarrow y_2' = y_2 + \\delta y$\nThe x-coordinates $x_1$ and $x_2$ remain unchanged.\n\nAs before, the kinetic energy $T$ is invariant under this transformation.\nLet's examine the potential energy term $V$:\n$V' = k(x_1^2 + (y_2')^2) = k(x_1^2 + (y_2 + \\delta y)^2) = k(x_1^2 + y_2^2 + 2y_2\\delta y + (\\delta y)^2)$\nThe infinitesimal change in potential energy is $\\delta V \\approx 2ky_2\\delta y$.\nSince the potential energy $V$ changes, the Lagrangian is not invariant under a global translation in the y-direction. Therefore, the y-component of the total linear momentum, $P_y$, is not conserved.\n\n**Alternative verification using Euler-Lagrange equations**\n\nThe Euler-Lagrange equation for a coordinate $q_i$ is $\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q_i}$.

This means their corresponding canonical momenta, $p_{1y} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{y}_1} = m\\dot{y}_1$ and $p_{2x} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x}_2} = m\\dot{x}_2$, are conserved. However, the question asks about the components of the *total* linear momentum, $P_x = p_{1x} + p_{2x}$ and $P_y = p_{1y} + p_{2y}$, which are not conserved.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth methods confirm that neither the x-component nor the y-component of the total linear momentum is conserved.
