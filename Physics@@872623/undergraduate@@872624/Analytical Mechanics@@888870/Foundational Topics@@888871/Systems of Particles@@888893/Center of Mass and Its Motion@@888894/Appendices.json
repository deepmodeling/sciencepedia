This thought experiment explores a profound consequence of Newton's laws: if no net external forces act on a system, the position of its center of mass remains fixed (if initially at rest). This principle allows us to predict the motion of parts of a system by focusing on the collective behavior, elegantly bypassing the need to analyze complex internal forces and interactions [@problem_id:2038124].", "problem": "A large block of mass $M$ has a smooth semicircular groove of radius $R$. The block is initially at rest on a perfectly frictionless horizontal floor. A small, point-like object of mass $m$ is gently placed at rest at the top-right edge of the groove. The system is then released. As the small object slides down the groove due to gravity, the large block moves horizontally. Determine the total horizontal distance traveled by the large block from its initial position at the precise moment the small object reaches the lowest point of the semicircular groove. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $M$, $m$, and $R$.", "solution": "Let the system consist of the large block of mass $M$ and the small object of mass $m$. The entire system rests on a frictionless horizontal floor. According to Newton's third law, the normal force between the object and the groove, and any frictional forces (which are absent as the groove is smooth), are internal to the system. The forces of gravity on the block and on the object are vertical. The normal force from the floor on the block is also vertical. Therefore, there are no net external horizontal forces acting on the system.\n\nBecause there is no net external horizontal force, the horizontal component of the total linear momentum of the system is conserved. A direct consequence of this conservation of momentum for a system starting from rest is that the horizontal position of the system's center of mass, $X_{CM}$, must remain constant throughout the motion.\n\nLet's establish a one-dimensional coordinate system along the horizontal direction. Let the origin, $x=0$, be the initial horizontal position of the center of the semicircular groove. The position of the block can be described by the position of this point, which we will denote as $X_g(t)$. The position of the small object is denoted by $x_m(t)$. Let's denote the position of the center of mass of the block as $X_M(t)$. Since the block is a rigid body, the horizontal distance between its own center of mass and the center of its groove is a constant, say $c$. Thus, we can write $X_M(t) = X_g(t) + c$. The specific value of $c$ depends on the block's geometry and mass distribution, but as we will see, it is not needed for the solution.\n\nThe horizontal position of the system's center of mass is given by the formula:\n$$X_{CM} = \\frac{m x_m(t) + M X_M(t)}{m+M}$$\nSubstituting the relation for the block's center of mass, we get:\n$$X_{CM} = \\frac{m x_m(t) + M (X_g(t) + c)}{m+M}$$\n\nNow, let's analyze the system at two key moments: the initial state ($t=0$) and the final state (when the object is at the bottom of the groove, $t=t_f$).\n\n**Initial State ($t=0$):**\nThe system is at rest. By our choice of coordinate system, the center of the groove is at the origin, so $X_g(0) = 0$.\nThe small object $m$ is at the top-right edge of the groove. Its horizontal position relative to the center of the groove is $R$. Therefore, its absolute horizontal position is $x_m(0) = X_g(0) + R = 0 + R = R$.\nThe horizontal position of the block's center of mass is $X_M(0) = X_g(0) + c = 0 + c = c$.\n\nThe initial horizontal position of the system's center of mass is:\n$$X_{CM}(0) = \\frac{m x_m(0) + M X_M(0)}{m+M} = \\frac{m(R) + M(c)}{m+M} = \\frac{mR + Mc}{m+M}$$\n\n**Final State ($t=t_f$):**\nThe block has moved. Let the new horizontal position of the center of the groove be $\\Delta X$. So, $X_g(t_f) = \\Delta X$. This $\\Delta X$ represents the horizontal displacement of the block.\nThe small object $m$ is now at the lowest point of the groove. Its horizontal position relative to the center of the groove is $0$. Therefore, its absolute horizontal position is $x_m(t_f) = X_g(t_f) + 0 = \\Delta X$.\nThe horizontal position of the block's center of mass is $X_M(t_f) = X_g(t_f) + c = \\Delta X + c$.\n\nThe final horizontal position of the system's center of mass is:\n$$X_{CM}(t_f) = \\frac{m x_m(t_f) + M X_M(t_f)}{m+M} = \\frac{m(\\Delta X) + M(\\Delta X + c)}{m+M} = \\frac{(m+M)\\Delta X + Mc}{m+M}$$\n\nAs established, the horizontal position of the center of mass must be conserved: $X_{CM}(0) = X_{CM}(t_f)$.\n$$\\frac{mR + Mc}{m+M} = \\frac{(m+M)\\Delta X + Mc}{m+M}$$\nWe can multiply both sides by $(m+M)$ and subtract $Mc$ from both sides:\n$$mR = (m+M)\\Delta X$$\nSolving for $\\Delta X$, the horizontal displacement of the block:\n$$\\Delta X = \\frac{mR}{m+M}$$\nThe question asks for the horizontal distance traveled by the block.
