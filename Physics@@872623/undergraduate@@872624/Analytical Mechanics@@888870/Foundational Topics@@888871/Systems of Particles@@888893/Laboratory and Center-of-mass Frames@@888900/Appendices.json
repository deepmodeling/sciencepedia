By applying the conservation of linear momentum, you will see how the center of mass of an isolated system remains stationary, even as its components move in opposite directions.", "problem": "An astronaut is performing maintenance on a long, rectangular satellite panel that is floating freely in deep space, far from any significant external forces. The system, consisting of the astronaut and the panel, is initially stationary in an inertial reference frame. The astronaut has a mass $m$, and the panel has a mass $M$.\n\nTo move from one end of the panel to the other, the astronaut begins to walk along the panel's main axis, which we align with the x-axis. The astronaut maintains a constant velocity *relative to the panel* given by the vector $\\vec{u} = u \\hat{x}$, where $u$ is a positive constant and $\\hat{x}$ is the unit vector in the positive x-direction. As a consequence of the astronaut's motion, the panel itself will move with respect to the inertial frame.\n\nDetermine the velocity vector of the panel, $\\vec{V}$, with respect to the initial inertial reference frame.", "solution": "Let the panel move with velocity $\\vec{V} = V\\,\\hat{x}$ in the inertial frame, and let the astronaut’s velocity in the inertial frame be $\\vec{v}_{a} = v_{a}\\,\\hat{x}$.

This exercise [@problem_id:2062438] introduces an external impulse to a system of two masses connected by a spring, allowing you to distinguish the effects of external versus internal forces.
