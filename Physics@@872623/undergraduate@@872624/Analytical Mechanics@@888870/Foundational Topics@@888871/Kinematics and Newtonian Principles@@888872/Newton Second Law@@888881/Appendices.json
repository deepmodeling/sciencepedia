This exercise requires you to decompose forces into components parallel and perpendicular to a surface, a fundamental skill in mechanics. By working backward from a desired final speed to determine a necessary physical property (the coefficient of friction), this problem elegantly connects the principles of dynamics with the equations of kinematics.

The chute is a straight ramp of length $L$, inclined at an angle $\\theta$ to the horizontal. To ensure the package arrives at the bottom with the correct orientation for the next sorting stage, it must have a precise final speed of $v_f$. The kinetic friction between the package and the chute material can be characterized by a coefficient of kinetic friction, $\\mu_k$. Assuming the acceleration of the package is constant throughout its slide, derive an expression for the required value of $\\mu_k$. Your expression should be in terms of $L$, $\\theta$, $v_f$, and the acceleration due to gravity, $g$.", "solution": "The problem requires us to find the coefficient of kinetic friction, $\\mu_k$, such that a package starting from rest acquires a speed $v_f$ over a distance $L$. This requires combining kinematics to relate speed and distance to acceleration, and dynamics (Newton's second law) to relate acceleration to the forces acting on the package, including friction.\n\nFirst, let's determine the required constant acceleration, $a$, for the package. The package starts from rest, so its initial velocity is $v_i = 0$. It travels a distance $L$ and reaches a final velocity $v_f$. We can use the time-independent kinematic equation:\n$$v_{f}^{2} = v_{i}^{2} + 2aL$$\nSubstituting $v_i = 0$, we get:\n$$v_{f}^{2} = 2aL$$\nSolving for the acceleration $a$, we find:\n$$a = \\frac{v_{f}^{2}}{2L}$$\n\nNext, we apply Newton's second law to the package to relate the forces to this acceleration. Let the mass of the package be $m$. We define a coordinate system where the x-axis points down the inclined plane and the y-axis is perpendicular to the plane, pointing away from it.\n\nWe analyze the forces in the y-direction. The forces acting are the normal force $N$ (in the positive y-direction) and the component of the gravitational force perpendicular to the incline, $mg\\cos(\\theta)$ (in the negative y-direction). Since the package does not accelerate in the y-direction (it doesn't lift off or sink into the chute), the net force in this direction is zero:\n$$\\sum F_y = N - mg\\cos(\\theta) = 0$$\nFrom this, we find the magnitude of the normal force:\n$$N = mg\\cos(\\theta)$$\n\nNow, we analyze the forces in the x-direction. The force pulling the package down the incline is the component of gravity parallel to the incline, which is $mg\\sin(\\theta)$ (in the positive x-direction). The force opposing the motion is the kinetic friction force, $f_k$, which acts up the incline (in the negative x-direction). The magnitude of the kinetic friction force is given by $f_k = \\mu_k N$.\nThe net force in the x-direction is the sum of these forces:\n$$\\sum F_x = mg\\sin(\\theta) - f_k$$\nSubstituting $f_k = \\mu_k N$ and using our expression for $N$:\n$$\\sum F_x = mg\\sin(\\theta) - \\mu_k (mg\\cos(\\theta))$$\n\nAccording to Newton's second law, the net force in the x-direction is equal to the mass of the package times its acceleration, $a$:\n$$\\sum F_x = ma$$\nTherefore, we can write:\n$$mg\\sin(\\theta) - \\mu_k mg\\cos(\\theta) = ma$$\nThe mass $m$ is present in every term, so we can divide the entire equation by $m$:\n$$g\\sin(\\theta) - \\mu_k g\\cos(\\theta) = a$$\n\nNow we have two expressions for the acceleration $a$. We can equate them to solve for $\\mu_k$:\n$$\\frac{v_{f}^{2}}{2L} = g\\sin(\\theta) - \\mu_k g\\cos(\\theta)$$\nOur goal is to isolate $\\mu_k$.
