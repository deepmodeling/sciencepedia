It is arranged in a straight line, which we align with the positive x-axis. The leftmost end of the entire assembly is placed at the origin $(0, 0)$.\n\nUsing only its internal motors, which apply torques at the pivots, the snake reconfigures itself into a new, rigid shape. In its final configuration, the middle rod is oriented parallel to the y-axis. The two end rods are attached to the respective ends of the middle rod, and they are both oriented parallel to the x-axis, pointing in the same direction (in the positive x-direction).\n\nDetermine the final x-coordinate of the center of the middle rod.
