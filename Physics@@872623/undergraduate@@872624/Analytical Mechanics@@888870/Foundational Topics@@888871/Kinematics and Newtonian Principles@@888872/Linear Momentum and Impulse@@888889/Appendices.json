The bead, with mass $m$, is launched towards a large, rigid, horizontal test plate. Just before impact, the bead's velocity vector has a magnitude of $v_0$ and makes an angle $\\theta$ with the normal to the plate's surface.\n\nThe interaction between the bead and the plate is characterized by two parameters. First, the component of the bead's velocity normal (perpendicular) to the surface is affected by a coefficient of restitution, $e$. This means the magnitude of the normal component of velocity just after impact is $e$ times its magnitude just before impact. Second, due to kinetic friction, the component of the bead's velocity tangential (parallel) to the surface just after impact is a fraction $\\alpha$ of its tangential component just before impact. Both $e$ and $\\alpha$ are dimensionless constants where $0 < e \\le 1$ and $0 < \\alpha \\le 1$.\n\nDetermine a symbolic expression for the magnitude of the total impulse delivered by the test plate to the bead during the collision. Your expression should be in terms of $m, v_0, \\theta, e$, and $\\alpha$.", "solution": "The impulse $\\vec{J}$ delivered to the bead is defined as the change in its linear momentum, $\\vec{J} = \\Delta \\vec{p} = \\vec{p}_f - \\vec{p}_i$. To find the total impulse, we will analyze the components of the velocity before and after the collision.\n\nLet's establish a coordinate system where the y-axis is normal to the plate's surface, pointing upward (away from the plate), and the x-axis is tangential to the surface. The origin is at the point of impact.\n\nThe initial velocity vector $\\vec{v}_i$ has a magnitude $v_0$ and makes an angle $\\theta$ with the normal (the y-axis). We can decompose this initial velocity into its components:\nThe component tangential to the surface (x-component) is $v_{ix} = v_0 \\sin\\theta$.\nThe component normal to the surface (y-component) is $v_{iy} = -v_0 \\cos\\theta$. The negative sign indicates that the bead is moving downwards, in the negative y-direction, before impact.\n\nNext, we determine the components of the final velocity vector $\\vec{v}_f$ immediately after the collision, based on the given parameters $e$ and $\\alpha$.\nThe problem states that the tangential component of velocity after impact is a fraction $\\alpha$ of the tangential component before impact. Assuming the bead continues to move in the same tangential direction, the final tangential component is:\n$v_{fx} = \\alpha v_{ix} = \\alpha v_0 \\sin\\theta$.\n\nFor the normal component, the coefficient of restitution $e$ relates the magnitudes of the normal velocities. The bead rebounds, so its final normal velocity is in the positive y-direction.\n$|v_{fy}| = e |v_{iy}|$\n$v_{fy} = e |-v_0 \\cos\\theta| = e v_0 \\cos\\theta$.\n\nNow we can calculate the change in momentum for each component.
