The origin can be considered the boat's starting position.\n\nThe problem requires the velocity of the ASV relative to the ground, $\\vec{v}_{bg}$, to be directed purely North. This means its x-component must be zero. We can write this vector as:\n$$\n\\vec{v}_{bg} = v_{bg} \\hat{j}\n$$\nwhere $v_{bg}$ is the magnitude we need to find, and $\\hat{j}$ is the unit vector in the North (positive y) direction.\n\nThe velocity of the ASV relative to the ground is the vector sum of its velocity relative to the water, $\\vec{v}_{bw}$, and the velocity of the water relative to the ground, $\\vec{v}_{wg}$.\n$$\n\\vec{v}_{bg} = \\vec{v}_{bw} + \\vec{v}_{wg}\n$$\n\nLet's decompose the given velocities into their x and y components.\n\nFirst, consider the velocity of the water relative to the ground, $\\vec{v}_{wg}$. Its magnitude is given as $v_{water} = 1.80 \\, \\text{m/s}$. The direction is $25.0^{\\circ}$ east of south. In our coordinate system, South is the negative y-direction. An angle $25.0^{\\circ}$ east of south corresponds to an angle of $-90^\\circ - 25.0^\\circ = -115.0^\\circ$ or $245.0^\\circ$ measured counter-clockwise from the positive x-axis (East).\nThe components are:\n$$\nv_{wg,x} = v_{water} \\cos(-115.0^\\circ) = (1.80 \\, \\text{m/s}) \\cos(-115.0^\\circ)\n$$\n$$\nv_{wg,y} = v_{water} \\sin(-115.0^\\circ) = (1.80 \\, \\text{m/s}) \\sin(-115.0^\\circ)\n$$\nAlternatively, and perhaps more intuitively, the angle with the negative y-axis is $25.0^\\circ$. So, the x-component is positive (East) and the y-component is negative (South).\n$$\nv_{wg,x} = v_{water} \\sin(25.0^\\circ)\n$$\n$$\nv_{wg,y} = -v_{water} \\cos(25.0^\\circ)\n$$\n\nNext, consider the velocity of the ASV relative to the water, $\\vec{v}_{bw}$. Its magnitude is given as $v_{boat} = 4.50 \\, \\text{m/s}$. To counteract the current's eastward drift and move purely north, the boat must steer somewhat to the west. Let $\\theta$ be the angle the boat's heading makes with the North (positive y-axis), measured towards the West. So, the components of $\\vec{v}_{bw}$ are:\n$$\nv_{bw,x} = -v_{boat} \\sin(\\theta)\n$$\n$$\nv_{bw,y} = v_{boat} \\cos(\\theta)\n$$\n\nNow, we can write the vector addition equation in terms of components:\nFor the x-components:\n$$\nv_{bg,x} = v_{bw,x} + v_{wg,x}\n$$\nSince the boat travels directly north, $v_{bg,x} = 0$.\n$$\n0 = -v_{boat} \\sin(\\theta) + v_{water} \\sin(25.0^\\circ)\n$$\nWe can solve this for the unknown angle $\\theta$:\n$$\nv_{boat} \\sin(\\theta) = v_{water} \\sin(25.0^\\circ)\n$$\n$$\n\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{v_{water}}{v_{boat}} \\sin(25.0^\\circ) = \\frac{1.80}{4.50} \\sin(25.0^\\circ) = 0.40 \\sin(25.0^\\circ)\n$$\nNumerically, $\\sin(25.0^\\circ) \\approx 0.422618$, so $\\sin(\\theta) \\approx 0.40 \\times 0.422618 = 0.169047$.\n\nFor the y-components:\nThe magnitude of the boat's velocity relative to the ground, $v_{bg}$, is simply the y-component of the total velocity.\n$$\nv_{bg} = v_{bg,y} = v_{bw,y} + v_{wg,y}\n$$\n$$\nv_{bg} = v_{boat} \\cos(\\theta) - v_{water} \\cos(25.0^\\circ)\n$$\nTo find $v_{bg}$, we need $\\cos(\\theta)$. We can find it using the identity $\\cos^2(\\theta) + \\sin^2(\\theta) = 1$. Since the boat is trying to go north, we expect $\\theta$ to be an acute angle, so $\\cos(\\theta)$ will be positive.\n$$\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2(\\theta)} = \\sqrt{1 - \\left( \\frac{v_{water}}{v_{boat}} \\sin(25.0^\\circ) \\right)^2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $v_{bg}$:\n$$\nv_{bg} = v_{boat} \\sqrt{1 - \\left( \\frac{v_{water}}{v_{boat}} \\sin(25.0^\\circ) \\right)^2} - v_{water} \\cos(25.0^\\circ)\n$$\nNow we substitute the numerical values:\n$$\n\\sin(25.0^\\circ) \\approx 0.422618\n$$\n$$\n\\cos(25.0^\\circ) \\approx 0.906308\n$$\nThe term inside the square root becomes:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{1.80}{4.50} \\sin(25.0^\\circ) \\right)^2 = (0.40 \\times 0.422618)^2 \\approx (0.169047)^2 \\approx 0.0285769\n$$\nThen the square root is:\n$$\n\\sqrt{1 - 0.0285769} = \\sqrt{0.9714231} \\approx 0.985608\n$$\nNow, we calculate $v_{bg}$:\n$$\nv_{bg} = (4.50 \\, \\text{m/s}) \\times 0.985608 - (1.80 \\, \\text{m/s}) \\times 0.906308\n$$\n$$\nv_{bg} \\approx 4.435236 \\, \\text{m/s} - 1.631354 \\, \\text{m/s}\n$$\n$$\nv_{bg} \\approx 2.803882 \\, \\text{m/s}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $2.80 \\, \\text{m/s}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.80}$$", "id": "2058734"}, {"introduction": "Inertial frames can differ not only by their relative velocity but also by their choice of origin.
