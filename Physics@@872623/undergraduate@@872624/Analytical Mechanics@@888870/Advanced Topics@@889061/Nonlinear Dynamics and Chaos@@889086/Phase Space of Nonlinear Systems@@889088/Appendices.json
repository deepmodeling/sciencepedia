To determine the sign of $v_{q}$, note that the observation at $x_{q} = -x_{p}$ implies the particle crossed the origin, so its total energy must satisfy $E  V(0) = 0$. Since $E  V(-x_{p}) = V(x_{p})$, the point $x = -x_{p}$ is not a turning point; along the continuous trajectory from $x_{p}$ moving left ($v_{p}  0$), the velocity remains negative when the particle first reaches $-x_{p}$. Therefore $v_{q}$ is the negative root of $v_{q}^{2} = v_{p}^{2}$, namely\n$$\nv_{q} = v_{p}.\n$$\nThis result follows from energy conservation and the even symmetry of the potential and is independent of the specific values of $k$ and $c$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{v_{p}}$$", "id": "2070277"}]}
