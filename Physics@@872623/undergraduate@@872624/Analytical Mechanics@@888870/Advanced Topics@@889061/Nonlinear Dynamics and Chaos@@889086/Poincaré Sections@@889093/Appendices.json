The dynamics are governed by a time-independent Hamiltonian, which represents the total energy of the star. For a star of unit mass moving in a two-dimensional plane $(x, y)$, the Hamiltonian is given by\n$$H(x, y, p_x, p_y) = \\frac{1}{2}(p_x^2 + p_y^2) + V(x, y)$$\nwhere $(p_x, p_y)$ are the momenta conjugate to the coordinates $(x, y)$, and the potential energy is\n$$V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2) + x^2y - \\frac{1}{3}y^3$$\nThe time evolution of the system is determined by Hamilton's equations: $\\dot{q}_i = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_i}$ and $\\dot{p}_i = - \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q_i}$ for $q_i \\in \\{x, y\\}$ and $p_i \\in \\{p_x, p_y\\}$.\n\nTo visualize the system's often chaotic behavior, the physicist wishes to construct a Poincaré section. The total energy of the star is conserved, so its motion is confined to a three-dimensional surface in the four-dimensional phase space defined by $H(x, y, p_x, p_y) = E_0$. The chosen section is the $y-p_y$ plane, defined by the condition $x=0$. Points are recorded on this section only when the trajectory crosses it in a specific direction, namely with positive momentum, $p_x > 0$.\n\nThe physicist uses a numerical algorithm that starts from a given initial condition and evolves the system in discrete time steps, $\\Delta t$. At a given time $t_k$, the state of the system is $(x_k, y_k, p_{x,k}, p_{y,k})$. The algorithm then computes the state at the next time step, $t_{k+1} = t_k + \\Delta t$.\n\nWhich of the following procedures correctly describes the core logic for identifying and recording a single new point on the specified Poincaré section?\n\nA. Advance the state from $t_k$ to $t_{k+1}$ using a numerical integrator. If $x_k \\cdot x_{k+1} < 0$ and $p_{x,k+1} > 0$, use interpolation between the states at $t_k$ and $t_{k+1}$ to find the values of $y$ and $p_y$ at the precise moment when $x=0$. Record this $(y, p_y)$ pair.\n\nB. Advance the state from $t_k$ to $t_{k+1}$. If $x_k < 0$ and $x_{k+1} \\geq 0$, and if $p_{x, k+1} > 0$, record the pair $(y_{k+1}, p_{y,k+1})$ as the point on the section.\n\nC. At each time step $t_k$, check if $|x_k|$ is less than a small tolerance $\\epsilon$. If this condition is met and $p_{x,k} > 0$, record the pair $(y_k, p_{y,k})$.\n\nD. Advance the state from $t_k$ to $t_{k+1}$. If $y_k \\cdot y_{k+1} < 0$ and $p_{y,k+1} > 0$, use interpolation between the states at $t_k$ and $t_{k+1}$ to find the values of $x$ and $p_x$ at the precise moment when $y=0$. Record this $(x, p_x)$ pair.\n\nE. First, analytically solve Hamilton's equations to find the functions $x(t)$, $y(t)$, $p_x(t)$, and $p_y(t)$. Then, solve the equation $x(t)=0$ for times $t^*$. For each $t^*$ where $p_x(t^*) > 0$, record the pair $(y(t^*), p_y(t^*))$.", "solution": "The Hamiltonian is $H(x,y,p_{x},p_{y})=\\frac{1}{2}(p_{x}^{2}+p_{y}^{2})+V(x,y)$ with $V(x,y)=\\frac{1}{2}(x^{2}+y^{2})+x^{2}y-\\frac{1}{3}y^{3}$.

In a discrete-time numerical integrator, a crossing within a step $[t_{k},t_{k+1}]$ is detected by a sign change $x_{k}x_{k+1}<0$. To record a correct section point, one must compute the precise time $t^{*}\\in[t_{k},t_{k+1}]$ such that $x(t^{*})=0$ and then evaluate $(y(t^{*}),p_{y}(t^{*}))$, ensuring the direction condition $p_{x}(t^{*})>0$. Practically, this is achieved by interpolation or a root-finding procedure between the states at $t_{k}$ and $t_{k+1}$.\n\nAssessing the options:\n- A detects crossings by $x_{k}x_{k+1}<0$ and uses interpolation to find the exact $(y,p_{y})$ at $x=0$. It also enforces the direction condition via $p_{x,k+1}>0$. While the most rigorous check is $p_{x}(t^{*})>0$ at the crossing instant, this option captures the core logic: sign-change detection, interpolation to the precise section, and a positive-momentum direction check. It is the only option that both uses the correct section and computes the point at the exact crossing.\n- B records $(y_{k+1},p_{y,k+1})$ without interpolation; this point generally does not lie on $x=0$, so it does not correctly construct the section.\n- C uses a tolerance $|x_{k}|<\\epsilon$ at discrete times, which can miss true crossings, include near misses, and does not guarantee an actual crossing event across $x=0$; it is not a correct core logic for Poincaré section construction.\n- D uses the wrong section ($y=0$) and records $(x,p_{x})$, so it does not match the specified $x=0$ section with $(y,p_{y})$.\n- E requires an analytic solution for the Hénon-Heiles system, which is non-integrable; this is not a feasible or intended numerical procedure.\n\nTherefore, the correct procedure is described by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2071663"}, {"introduction": "While complex systems require numerical tools, simpler, regular systems provide invaluable insight into what a Poincaré section represents.
