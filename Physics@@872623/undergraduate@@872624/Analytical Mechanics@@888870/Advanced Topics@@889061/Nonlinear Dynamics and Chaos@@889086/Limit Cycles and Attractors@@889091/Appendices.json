One type of long-term behavior is an attracting limit cycle, which is a closed trajectory that nearby trajectories approach as time goes to infinity. The existence of an attracting limit cycle is linked to the contraction of areas in the phase space. For a two-dimensional system with a state vector $(x,y)$ evolving according to a vector field $\\mathbf{V}(x,y) = (f(x,y), g(x,y))$, the local rate of area expansion or contraction is given by the divergence of the vector field, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{V} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y}$.

This result holds for any non-zero real values of the constants $a$ and $b$.\n\nA divergence of zero means that the phase space area is locally conserved under the flow. This is a key feature of conservative (specifically, Hamiltonian) systems. Trajectories may follow closed orbits, but they cannot systematically spiral towards an attractor. An attracting limit cycle, by definition, requires trajectories in its vicinity to converge onto it. This convergence necessitates a shrinking of phase space area, which would correspond to a negative divergence (at least on average) in the basin of attraction.\n\nSince the divergence is zero everywhere, phase space area is neither expanding nor contracting. Therefore, the necessary condition for the existence of an attracting limit cycle (negative average divergence) is not met. The system cannot support attracting limit cycles.\n\nThis conclusion is independent of the specific non-zero values or signs of the parameters $a$ and $b$. Thus, for any non-zero real values of $a$ and $b$, the system cannot have attracting limit cycles. Comparing this conclusion with the given options, we find that it matches option D.
