For design and calibration purposes, we model the probe as a cantilever beam. The probe has a length $L$, a solid circular cross-section of radius $r$, and is made from a material with a Young's modulus of $E$. In a ground test, the probe is fixed horizontally at one end. A small calibration weight applies a vertical downward force $F$ at the free end. We are interested in the vertical displacement of the probe's tip under this load.\n\nThe parameters for the test are as follows:\n- Length, $L = 1.50 \\text{ m}$\n- Radius, $r = 1.25 \\text{ cm}$\n- Young's modulus, $E = 195 \\text{ GPa}$ (Gigapascals)\n- Applied force, $F = 45.0 \\text{ N}$\n\nAssume the probe's own weight is negligible compared to the applied force and that the resulting deflection is small enough for the linear Euler-Bernoulli beam theory to be applicable.\n\nCalculate the magnitude of the vertical displacement of the probe's free end. Express your answer in millimeters (mm), rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the magnitude of the vertical displacement at the free end of a cantilever beam under a point load. This can be determined using the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory.\n\nThe governing differential equation for the deflection $w(x)$ of a beam is given by:\n$$EI \\frac{d^2w}{dx^2} = M(x)$$\nwhere $E$ is the Young's modulus, $I$ is the area moment of inertia of the beam's cross-section, and $M(x)$ is the internal bending moment as a function of the position $x$ along the beam.\n\nLet's set up a coordinate system where $x=0$ is at the fixed (cantilevered) end and $x=L$ is at the free end where the force $F$ is applied. Let $w(x)$ represent the upward vertical displacement. The downward force $F$ is applied at $x=L$.\n\nFirst, we determine the bending moment $M(x)$ at an arbitrary cross-section $x$. Consider the portion of the beam from $x$ to $L$. For this section to be in static equilibrium, the moment at the cut face at $x$ must balance the moment generated by the force $F$ at the end. Taking moments about the point at position $x$:\n$$M(x) + F(L-x) = 0$$\nThe convention used here is that a positive bending moment causes the beam to bend into a \"smile\" shape (positive curvature/concave up). The downward force $F$ causes the beam to bend downwards (negative curvature/concave down), so the internal moment is negative.\n$$M(x) = -F(L-x)$$\n\nNow, we substitute this into the Euler-Bernoulli equation:\n$$EI \\frac{d^2w}{dx^2} = -F(L-x)$$\n\nTo find the deflection $w(x)$, we integrate this equation twice with respect to $x$. Integrating once gives the slope of the beam, $\\theta(x) = \\frac{dw}{dx}$:\n$$EI \\frac{dw}{dx} = \\int -F(L-x) dx = -F \\left(Lx - \\frac{x^2}{2}\\right) + C_1$$\nwhere $C_1$ is the first integration constant. We use the boundary condition for a cantilever beam at the fixed end ($x=0$): the slope must be zero.\n$$\\frac{dw}{dx}(0) = 0$$\nSubstituting this into the integrated equation:\n$$EI \\cdot 0 = -F \\left(L(0) - \\frac{0^2}{2}\\right) + C_1 \\implies C_1 = 0$$\nSo, the equation for the slope is:\n$$EI \\frac{dw}{dx} = -F \\left(Lx - \\frac{x^2}{2}\\right)$$\n\nIntegrating a second time gives the deflection $w(x)$:\n$$EI w(x) = \\int -F \\left(Lx - \\frac{x^2}{2}\\right) dx = -F \\left(\\frac{Lx^2}{2} - \\frac{x^3}{6}\\right) + C_2$$\nwhere $C_2$ is the second integration constant. We use the second boundary condition at the fixed end ($x=0$): the deflection must be zero.\n$$w(0) = 0$$\nSubstituting this into the deflection equation:\n$$EI \\cdot 0 = -F \\left(\\frac{L(0)^2}{2} - \\frac{0^3}{6}\\right) + C_2 \\implies C_2 = 0$$\nThe full equation for the deflection curve is:\n$$w(x) = -\\frac{F}{EI} \\left(\\frac{Lx^2}{2} - \\frac{x^3}{6}\\right)$$\n\nWe need to find the deflection at the free end, where $x=L$:\n$$w(L) = -\\frac{F}{EI} \\left(\\frac{L(L^2)}{2} - \\frac{L^3}{6}\\right) = -\\frac{F}{EI} \\left(\\frac{3L^3}{6} - \\frac{L^3}{6}\\right) = -\\frac{F}{EI} \\left(\\frac{2L^3}{6}\\right) = -\\frac{FL^3}{3EI}$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the deflection is downward, as expected.
