The device consists of a block of mass $m$ attached to one end of a horizontal spring with spring constant $k$. The other end of the spring is fixed to the front interior wall of a testing vehicle. The block rests on the horizontal floor of the vehicle, and the spring is initially at its natural length. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the floor is $\\mu_k$. The vehicle starts from rest and moves with a constant horizontal acceleration $a$. The magnitude of the acceleration is sufficiently large to cause the block to slide backwards relative to the vehicle until it reaches a new, stable equilibrium position. Determine the elongation of the spring, $x_f$, in this final equilibrium state. Express your answer in terms of $m, k, a, \\mu_k,$ and the acceleration due to gravity, $g$.", "solution": "Take the vehicle’s forward direction as positive $x$ and analyze the block in the non-inertial frame of the vehicle, which has constant acceleration $a$ forward. In this frame there is a fictitious (inertial) force of magnitude $m a$ acting backward on the block. The real horizontal forces on the block are the spring force $k x$ forward when the spring is stretched by $x$ and the kinetic friction force of magnitude $\\mu_{k} N$ acting forward because the block slides backward relative to the floor. Vertically, there is no acceleration, so $N = m g$.\n\nIn the final steady state described (constant position relative to the accelerating vehicle, i.e., zero acceleration in the vehicle frame), the horizontal force balance in the accelerating frame is\n$$\nk x_{f} + \\mu_{k} m g - m a = 0,\n$$\nwhere $k x_{f}$ and $\\mu_{k} m g$ act forward and the fictitious force $m a$ acts backward.

It is most convenient to analyze the forces on mass $m_1$ from the perspective of a non-inertial reference frame co-rotating with the turntable.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hanging mass $m_2$. Since the system is in equilibrium, the mass $m_2$ is stationary (not accelerating vertically). The forces acting on it are the gravitational force, $F_{g,2} = m_2 g$, directed downwards, and the tension in the cord, $T$, directed upwards. For vertical equilibrium of $m_2$:\n$$\n\\sum F_y = T - m_2 g = 0\n$$\nThis gives us the tension in the cord:\n$$\nT = m_2 g\n$$\n\nNow, let's analyze the forces on the puck of mass $m_1$ in the rotating reference frame. Since the puck is stationary with respect to the turntable, its velocity and acceleration in this frame are zero. The forces acting on the puck in the radial direction are:\n1.  The tension force, $T$, from the cord, pulling the puck radially inward towards the center.\n2.  The fictitious centrifugal force, $F_{cf}$, pushing the puck radially outward.\n\nThe magnitude of the centrifugal force is given by $F_{cf} = m_1 \\omega^2 r$, where $r$ is the radial distance from the axis of rotation.\n\nFor the puck to be in equilibrium in the rotating frame, the net radial force must be zero. Let's define the outward radial direction as positive.\n$$\n\\sum F_r = F_{cf} - T = 0\n$$\nThis implies that the centrifugal force must balance the tension:\n$$\nF_{cf} = T\n$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the forces:\n$$\nm_1 \\omega^2 r = T\n$$\n\nWe can now substitute the expression for the tension $T$ that we found from analyzing mass $m_2$:\n$$\nm_1 \\omega^2 r = m_2 g\n$$\n\nFinally, we solve for the equilibrium radius $r$:\n$$\nr = \\frac{m_2 g}{m_1 \\omega^{2}}\n$$\n\nIn the vertical direction for mass $m_1$, the gravitational force $m_1 g$ is balanced by the normal force from the turntable, but this information is not needed to find the radius $r$.
