The simple VB wavefunction, by contrast, contains only covalent structures.\n\nA quantitative measure of the predicted ionic character in a given model is defined as the ratio of the squared norm of the ionic part of the spatial wavefunction to the squared norm of the total spatial wavefunction. The ionic part is defined as the sum of all terms in the wavefunction where both electrons are associated with the same atom.\n\nLet $S$ be the overlap integral between the two atomic orbitals, defined as $S = \\int \\phi_A(\\vec{r}) \\phi_B(\\vec{r}) d\\tau$, where the integral is taken over all space.
