{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "One of the most compelling triumphs of Molecular Orbital (MO) theory is its ability to explain magnetic properties that simpler bonding models, like Lewis structures, cannot. The diatomic boron molecule ($\\mathrm{B}_2$) is a classic case; experimentally, it is found to be paramagnetic, meaning it has unpaired electrons. This practice challenges you to apply the principles of MO theory to construct the electronic configuration of $\\mathrm{B}_2$ and reveal the origin of its paramagnetism [@problem_id:2049975].", "problem": "Experimental measurements have shown that the diatomic boron molecule, $\\mathrm{B}_2$, is paramagnetic, meaning it is weakly attracted to a magnetic field. This property arises from the presence of unpaired electrons in the molecule. According to Molecular Orbital (MO) theory, the electronic structure of a molecule determines its magnetic properties. For homonuclear diatomic molecules of the second period elements up to and including nitrogen (i.e., $\\mathrm{Li}_2$ through $\\mathrm{N}_2$), the energy ordering of the molecular orbitals derived from the 2p atomic orbitals is $\\pi_{2p}$ followed by $\\sigma_{2p}$.\n\nBased on this information and the principles of MO theory, which of the following statements correctly explains the paramagnetism of the $\\mathrm{B}_2$ molecule?\n\nA. The highest occupied molecular orbitals are the degenerate $\\pi_{2p}$ orbitals, which each contain one electron with parallel spins.\n\nB. The two valence electrons with the highest energy are paired in a single $\\sigma_{2p}$ molecular orbital.\n\nC.

The highest occupied molecular orbital is the $\\sigma_{2p}$ orbital, which contains two unpaired electrons.", "solution": "According to molecular orbital theory, the magnetic behavior of a molecule is determined by whether there are unpaired electrons in its molecular orbitals. Paramagnetism arises from one or more unpaired electrons; diamagnetism results when all electrons are paired.\n\nEach boron atom has atomic number 5 and an electron configuration that places three electrons in its valence shell. For the diatomic molecule $\\mathrm{B}_2$, the total number of electrons is 10. In homonuclear diatomics from $\\mathrm{Li}_2$ through $\\mathrm{N}_2$, the $2p$-derived molecular orbital energy ordering is (from lower to higher) $\\pi_{2p}$ followed by $\\sigma_{2p}$. The Aufbau principle dictates filling from lowest to highest orbital energy; the Pauli exclusion principle restricts occupancy to at most two electrons per orbital with opposite spins; and Hund's rule requires that electrons occupy degenerate orbitals singly with parallel spins before pairing.\n\nThe relevant MO energy sequence (including core and valence) is\n$$\n\\sigma_{1s}, \\sigma_{1s}^*, \\sigma_{2s}, \\sigma_{2s}^*, \\pi_{2p_x}=\\pi_{2p_y}, \\sigma_{2p_z}.\n$$\nFilling 10 electrons in order gives\n$$\n(\\sigma_{1s})^2(\\sigma_{1s}^*)^2(\\sigma_{2s})^2(\\sigma_{2s}^*)^2(\\pi_{2p_x})^1(\\pi_{2p_y})^1.\n$$\nBecause $\\pi_{2p_x}$ and $\\pi_{2p_y}$ are degenerate, the two remaining valence electrons occupy these orbitals singly with parallel spins by Hund's rule. This leaves two unpaired electrons in the degenerate $\\pi_{2p}$ orbitals, which makes $\\mathrm{B}_2$ paramagnetic.\n\nTherefore, the correct explanation is that the highest occupied molecular orbitals are the degenerate $\\pi_{2p}$ orbitals, each containing one electron with parallel spins. This corresponds to option A. The other options are inconsistent: option B incorrectly places both highest-energy electrons paired in $\\sigma_{2p}$; option C pairs both in a single $\\pi_{2p}$ orbital contrary to Hund's rule; option D asserts diamagnetism despite unpaired electrons; and option E incorrectly identifies $\\sigma_{2p}$ as the HOMO and incorrectly suggests two unpaired electrons in a single $\\sigma$ orbital.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2049975"}, {"introduction": "Beyond explaining observed properties, MO theory provides a powerful predictive framework for chemical bonding.
