The existence of the dihelium excimer ($\\text{He}_2^*$), a stable molecule formed from two noble gas atoms in an excited state, is a classic example that defies simpler theories.

[@problem_id:2034955]", "problem": "Molecular Orbital (MO) theory provides a robust framework for understanding chemical bonding. For the dihelium molecule ($\\text{He}_2$), the theory predicts that the four electrons from two helium atoms would populate the molecular orbitals to give the ground-state electronic configuration $(\\sigma_{1s})^2(\\sigma_{1s}^*)^2$. This configuration has an equal number of electrons in the bonding ($\\sigma_{1s}$) and antibonding ($\\sigma_{1s}^*$) orbitals, leading to a calculated bond order of zero and correctly predicting that $\\text{He}_2$ is not a stable molecule.\n\nHowever, contrary to the instability of its ground state, spectroscopic evidence has confirmed the existence of a bound excited state of dihelium, denoted $\\text{He}_2^*$. This type of molecule, which is bound in an excited state but unbound in its ground state, is known as an excimer. The lowest-energy excited configuration for $\\text{He}_2$ is formed when an electron is promoted from the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the ground state to the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO).

The promotion of an electron to the more diffuse $\\sigma_{2s}$ orbital significantly reduces the overall electron-electron repulsion compared to the nuclear-electron attraction, allowing a stable bond to form.\n\nB.
