A workhorse atom for these applications is Rubidium-87 ($^{87}$Rb). Consider a single, electrically neutral $^{87}$Rb atom isolated in its electronic ground state, which is designated by the spectroscopic term symbol $5S_{1/2}$.\n\nThe nucleus of the $^{87}$Rb atom is not a dimensionless point; it possesses an intrinsic quantum mechanical angular momentum known as nuclear spin. The nuclear spin for $^{87}$Rb is characterized by the quantum number $I = 3/2$. This intrinsic property gives the nucleus a magnetic dipole moment. An interaction between the electron's magnetic properties and this nuclear magnetic dipole moment causes the single energy level of the ground state to split into a set of very closely spaced sub-levels.\n\nDetermine the total number of distinct quantum states that constitute the $5S_{1/2}$ ground-state manifold of a $^{87}$Rb atom when this interaction is taken into account.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total number of quantum states in the ground state of a Rubidium-87 atom, considering the interaction between the electron and the nucleus. This requires us to find the total degeneracy of the ground state manifold.\n\nThe total number of states can be calculated in two equivalent ways: by considering the uncoupled basis of the electron and nuclear states, or by considering the coupled basis of the total atomic angular momentum.\n\n**1. Uncoupled Basis Method**\n\nIn the uncoupled basis, we consider the electron's state and the nucleus's state independently. The total number of states is simply the product of the number of states available to the electron and the number of states available to the nucleus.\n\nThe state of the electron is described by its total electronic angular momentum, $\\vec{J}$. The degeneracy of this state is given by $g_J = 2J+1$, corresponding to the possible values of its projection, $m_J$.\nFrom the spectroscopic term symbol for the ground state, $5S_{1/2}$, we can identify the total electronic angular momentum quantum number $J$. The subscript $1/2$ directly gives us $J=1/2$.\nTherefore, the number of electronic states is:\n$g_J = 2J+1 = 2(\\frac{1}{2}) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nThe state of the nucleus is described by its nuclear spin, $\\vec{I}$. The degeneracy of this state is given by $g_I = 2I+1$, corresponding to the possible values of its projection, $m_I$.\nThe problem gives the nuclear spin quantum number as $I=3/2$.\nTherefore, the number of nuclear spin states is:\n$g_I = 2I+1 = 2(\\frac{3}{2}) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4$.\n\nThe total number of states, $N$, in the ground state manifold is the product of these degeneracies:\n$N = g_J \\times g_I = (2J+1)(2I+1)$\n$N = 2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n\n**2. Coupled Basis Method**\n\nThe interaction between the electron's magnetic moment (related to $\\vec{J}$) and the nucleus's magnetic moment (related to $\\vec{I}$) couples these two angular momenta to form the total atomic angular momentum, $\\vec{F} = \\vec{J} + \\vec{I}$.\n\nThe quantum number $F$ associated with the total angular momentum can take on integer-spaced values from $|J-I|$ to $J+I$.\nGiven $J=1/2$ and $I=3/2$:\n$F_{min} = |J-I| = |\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{3}{2}| = |-1| = 1$.\n$F_{max} = J+I = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$.\nSo, the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number are $F=1$ and $F=2$. These two values correspond to the two distinct hyperfine sub-levels into which the ground state splits.\n\nEach of these sub-levels, characterized by a specific value of $F$, has a degeneracy of $g_F = 2F+1$. This degeneracy corresponds to the possible values of the projection of the total angular momentum, $m_F$, which ranges from $-F$ to $F$.\n\nFor the sub-level with $F=1$, the number of states is:\n$g_{F=1} = 2(1)+1 = 3$.\n\nFor the sub-level with $F=2$, the number of states is:\n$g_{F=2} = 2(2)+1 = 5$.\n\nThe total number of states, $N$, is the sum of the degeneracies of all possible sub-levels:\n$N = g_{F=1} + g_{F=2} = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, confirming that there are 8 distinct quantum states in the ground-state manifold of Rubidium-87.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "1998592"}, {"introduction": "Once we have identified the hyperfine states, the next step is to quantify the energy difference between them.
