The resulting vacancy is then filled by an electron from a higher energy level. The energy released during this relaxation process can be transferred to another electron, which is then ejected from the atom. This ejected electron is called an Auger electron.\n\nConsider a neutral magnesium atom which has been ionized by removing an electron from its K-shell (the innermost shell). This core-hole is subsequently filled by an electron transitioning from the L-shell. The energy of this transition is imparted to another electron, also in the L-shell, which is then ejected from the atom.

The atom relaxes through a non-radiative process where an outer electron fills this vacancy, and the released energy is transferred to another electron, ejecting it from the atom. This ejected particle is called an Auger electron, and its kinetic energy is characteristic of the parent atom.\n\nAn Auger transition is denoted by a three-letter code $XYZ$, where $X$ is the shell of the initial vacancy, $Y$ is the shell of the electron that fills the vacancy, and $Z$ is the shell of the ejected Auger electron. The kinetic energy of the Auger electron, $K_{XYZ}$, is given by the difference between the energy of the initial atomic state (with one hole in shell $X$) and the energy of the final atomic state (with two holes, one in shell $Y$ and one in shell $Z$).\n\nFor a heavy atom with at least a filled L-shell ($n=2$), consider two possible Auger processes following the creation of a K-shell ($n=1$) vacancy: the $KL_1L_1$ process and the $KL_2L_3$ process.

They are less screened by other electrons and are therefore more tightly bound (i.e., have a higher binding energy).\n2.  **Spin-Orbit Coupling:** For a given $n$ and $l>0$, fine structure splitting occurs. The state with the lower total angular momentum quantum number $j$ is more tightly bound (i.e., has a higher binding energy).\n\nBased on these principles, which of the following statements correctly compares the kinetic energy, $K_{KL_1L_1}$, of an electron from the $KL_1L_1$ process with the kinetic energy, $K_{KL_2L_3}$, of an electron from the $KL_2L_3$ process?\n\nA.
