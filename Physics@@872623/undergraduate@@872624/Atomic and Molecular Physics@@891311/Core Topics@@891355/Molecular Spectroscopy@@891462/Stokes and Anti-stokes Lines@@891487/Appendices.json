This first exercise focuses on a specific type of inelastic scattering known as anti-Stokes scattering, where an incoming photon gains energy from a molecule that is already in an excited vibrational state. By applying the fundamental law of energy conservation to this interaction, you can directly calculate the energy of the resulting higher-energy scattered photon, providing a solid quantitative foundation for understanding this process [@problem_id:2026212].", "problem": "An environmental monitoring system uses a laser to detect the presence of a specific pollutant molecule in the atmosphere.

The fundamental principle governing this interaction is the conservation of energy. We can set up an energy balance equation for the system before and after the scattering event.\n\nLet the initial energy of the system be $E_{initial}$ and the final energy be $E_{final}$.\nThe initial state consists of an incident photon with energy $E_{incident}$ and a molecule in its first excited vibrational state.

The physicists then illuminate the sample with a monochromatic laser and collect the spectrum of the scattered light.\n\nThis scattering process, known as Raman scattering, involves photons being inelastically scattered by the molecules. The scattered photons can have a frequency that is lower than the incident laser frequency (Stokes scattering) or higher than the incident laser frequency (anti-Stokes scattering).
