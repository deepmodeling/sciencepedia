The R-branch ($\\Delta J = +1$)**\nFor the R-branch, the selection rule is $J' - J'' = +1$, which means $J' = J'' + 1$. We can label the lines in the R-branch by the quantum number of the lower state, $J''$. Let's denote $J''$ as $J$ for simplicity ($J = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$).

The P-branch ($\\Delta J = -1$)**\nFor the P-branch, the selection rule is $J' - J'' = -1$, which means $J' = J'' - 1$. Let's again denote $J''$ as $J$ for simplicity.

There is no line at $\\tilde{\\nu}_0$ itself because $\\Delta J=0$ (the Q-branch) is forbidden for this type of transition.\n\nThe first line in the R-branch corresponds to $J=0$:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_R(0) = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 + 2B(0+1) = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 + 2B $$\nThe first line in the P-branch corresponds to $J=1$:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_P(1) = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 - 2B(1) = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 - 2B $$\nThe separation between the first R-branch line and the first P-branch line is the size of the central gap:\n$$ \\text{Gap} = \\tilde{\\nu}_R(0) - \\tilde{\\nu}_P(1) = (\\tilde{\\nu}_0 + 2B) - (\\tilde{\\nu}_0 - 2B) = 4B $$\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe spectrum consists of a series of lines on either side of the band origin $\\tilde{\\nu}_0$. Both the P and R branches consist of lines that are equally spaced by $2B$. There is a central gap of $4B$ where no lines appear, centered at $\\tilde{\\nu}_0$.
