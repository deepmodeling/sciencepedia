The dipole moment arises from two key factors: the electronegativity difference creating partial charges, and the bond length separating them. This practice [@problem_id:1989389] challenges you to analyze the competing effects of these two factors in the hydrogen halide series and develop a deeper intuition for why one molecule is more polar than another.", "problem": "The permanent electric dipole moment of a diatomic molecule is a measure of the separation of positive and negative electrical charges within the molecule. This property arises from the polarity of the covalent bond between the two atoms, which is in turn related to the difference in their electronegativity and their separation distance (bond length).\n\nConsider the three hydrogen halide molecules: hydrogen fluoride (HF), hydrogen chloride (HCl), and hydrogen bromide (HBr). The relevant physical data for these molecules are provided below.\n\nElectronegativity values on the Pauling scale:\n- Hydrogen (H): 2.20\n- Fluorine (F): 3.98\n- Chlorine (Cl): 3.16\n- Bromine (Br): 2.96\n\nEquilibrium bond lengths:\n- HF: 91.7 pm\n- HCl: 127.4 pm\n- HBr: 141.4 pm\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements correctly ranks the magnitudes of the permanent electric dipole moments ($p_{HF}$, $p_{HCl}$, $p_{HBr}$) and provides the best physical justification for the trend?\n\nA. The ranking is $p_{HF} > p_{HCl} > p_{HBr}$. The trend is primarily determined by the substantial decrease in the electronegativity difference between hydrogen and the halogen atom as one moves down the group, which is a more dominant effect than the corresponding increase in bond length.\n\nB. The ranking is $p_{HBr} > p_{HCl} > p_{HF}$. The trend is primarily determined by the steady increase in bond length as one moves down the group, and the dipole moment is directly proportional to this distance.\n\nC. The ranking is $p_{HF} > p_{HCl} > p_{HBr}$. The trend is due to the increase in the size of the halogen's electron cloud, which leads to greater polarizability and thus a larger induced dipole moment that counteracts the permanent dipole moment.\n\nD. The ranking is $p_{HF} \\approx p_{HCl} \\approx p_{HBr}$. The effect of the increasing bond length is almost perfectly compensated by the effect of the decreasing electronegativity difference, leading to nearly identical dipole moments for all three molecules.\n\nE. The ranking is $p_{HCl} > p_{HF} > p_{HBr}$. The product of bond length and electronegativity difference reaches a maximum for HCl, indicating a non-monotonic relationship for the dipole moment.", "solution": "The problem asks us to rank the magnitudes of the permanent electric dipole moments of the hydrogen halides HF, HCl, and HBr, and to identify the correct physical reasoning for this trend.\n\nThe electric dipole moment, $\\vec{p}$, of a simple diatomic molecule can be modeled as two point charges, $+q$ and $-q$, separated by a distance $r$, which is the bond length. The magnitude of the dipole moment is given by the product of the charge magnitude and the separation distance:\n$$ p = q \\cdot r $$\n\nIn this model, the partial charge $q$ is not the full charge of an electron. Instead, it represents the degree of charge separation in the polar covalent bond. This partial charge is directly related to the difference in electronegativity, $\\Delta\\chi$, between the two bonded atoms. A larger electronegativity difference leads to a more polar bond and thus a larger magnitude of the partial charge $q$.\n\nWe must analyze two competing factors that determine the magnitude of the dipole moment $p$:\n1.  **The partial charge ($q$)**, which is a function of the electronegativity difference ($\\Delta\\chi$).\n2.  **The bond length ($r$)**.\n\nLet's analyze the trend for each of these factors for the series HF, HCl, HBr.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the electronegativity difference ($\\Delta\\chi$)**\n\nWe calculate $\\Delta\\chi = |\\chi_{\\text{halogen}} - \\chi_{\\text{H}}|$ for each molecule using the provided data:\n- For HF: $\\Delta\\chi_{HF} = |3.98 - 2.20| = 1.78$\n- For HCl: $\\Delta\\chi_{HCl} = |3.16 - 2.20| = 0.96$\n- For HBr: $\\Delta\\chi_{HBr} = |2.96 - 2.20| = 0.76$\n\nThe trend for the electronegativity difference is clearly:\n$$ \\Delta\\chi_{HF} > \\Delta\\chi_{HCl} > \\Delta\\chi_{HBr} $$\nThis implies that the magnitude of the partial charge $q$ also follows this trend:\n$$ q_{HF} > q_{HCl} > q_{HBr} $$\nThis factor, by itself, would lead to a dipole moment trend of $p_{HF} > p_{HCl} > p_{HBr}$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the bond length ($r$)**\n\nFrom the problem statement, the bond lengths are:\n- $r_{HF} = 91.7 \\text{ pm}$\n- $r_{HCl} = 127.4 \\text{ pm}$\n- $r_{HBr} = 141.4 \\text{ pm}$\n\nThe trend for the bond length is:\n$$ r_{HBr} > r_{HCl} > r_{HF} $$\nThis factor, by itself, would lead to a dipole moment trend of $p_{HBr} > p_{HCl} > p_{HF}$.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the competing trends**\n\nWe have two opposing trends. The partial charge $q$ decreases down the group (from F to Br), while the bond length $r$ increases. The final trend of the dipole moment $p = q \\cdot r$ depends on which of these two effects is dominant.\n\nLet's compare the relative changes:\n- From HF to HCl: $\\Delta\\chi$ decreases by $(1.78 - 0.96)/1.78 \\approx 46\\%$. The bond length $r$ increases by $(127.4 - 91.7)/91.7 \\approx 39\\%$. The large percentage decrease in $\\Delta\\chi$ suggests it is the dominant factor.\n- From HCl to HBr: $\\Delta\\chi$ decreases by $(0.96 - 0.76)/0.96 \\approx 21\\%$. The bond length $r$ increases by $(141.4 - 127.4)/127.4 \\approx 11\\%$. Again, the percentage decrease in $\\Delta\\chi$ is larger than the percentage increase in $r$.\n\nIn both steps down the group, the reduction in bond polarity (due to decreasing $\\Delta\\chi$) is more significant than the increase in bond length. The exceptionally high electronegativity of fluorine makes the HF bond extremely polar, resulting in a very large partial charge $q_{HF}$. This large charge term overwhelmingly determines the dipole moment, making $p_{HF}$ the largest in the series. As we proceed to HCl and HBr, the fall in electronegativity continues to be the controlling factor.\n\nTherefore, the overall trend for the dipole moment magnitude is expected to be a decrease as we move down the group:\n$$ p_{HF} > p_{HCl} > p_{HBr} $$\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given options**\n\n- **A:** States the ranking is $p_{HF} > p_{HCl} > p_{HBr}$ and correctly identifies that the decrease in electronegativity difference is the dominant factor over the increase in bond length. This matches our analysis.\n- **B:** Proposes the opposite ranking, which would only be true if bond length were the dominant or sole factor. This is incorrect.\n- **C:** Gives the correct ranking but provides a less precise and secondary reason. While polarizability is a real effect, the primary driver for the permanent dipole moment trend is the electronegativity difference, not polarizability (which relates more to induced dipoles).\n- **D:** Claims the effects cancel, leading to nearly equal dipole moments. Our analysis shows the effects do not cancel; the change in polarity is stronger. Experimental values confirm this (e.g., $p_{HF} \\approx 1.86$ D, $p_{HCl} \\approx 1.08$ D), showing they are not nearly identical.\n- **E:** Proposes an incorrect, non-monotonic ranking. There is no physical basis to expect a peak at HCl.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A provides both the correct ranking and the correct physical explanation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1989389"}, {"introduction": "A molecule's permanent dipole moment is most significant because of how it interacts with its environment, particularly with external electric fields.
