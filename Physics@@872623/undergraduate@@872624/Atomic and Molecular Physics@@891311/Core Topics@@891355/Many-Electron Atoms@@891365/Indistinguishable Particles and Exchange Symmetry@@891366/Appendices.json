This exercise challenges you to calculate the ground state energy for two identical fermions, first under the incorrect assumption that they are distinguishable, and then correctly as spin-polarized indistinguishable particles [@problem_id:1997131].

Two identical, non-interacting particles, each of mass $m$, are confined within this well. The particles are spin-$1/2$ fermions. We wish to compare the ground state energy of the system under two different theoretical models.\n\nFirst, as a thought experiment, calculate the ground state energy, which we will call $E_{dist}$, for this two-particle system under the incorrect assumption that the particles are distinguishable. For this case, you can imagine the particles can be individually labeled and their combined wavefunction does not need to be symmetrized according to the principles of quantum statistics.\n\nNext, consider the actual physical situation where the particles are treated correctly as indistinguishable spin-$1/2$ fermions. For this specific problem, assume the two fermions are prepared in the same spin state (i.e., they are spin-polarized).

The total wavefunction of identical fermions must be antisymmetric under particle exchange, so the spatial part must be antisymmetric. An antisymmetric spatial state cannot be formed from two identical single-particle orbitals; thus the two fermions must occupy different one-particle levels.

This thought experiment invites you to imagine a universe where electrons are bosons and determine the ground state of a Beryllium atom under this new rule [@problem_id:1997116]. Your findings will provide a dramatic illustration of why the fermionic nature of electrons is essential for the structure of matter and the diversity of the chemical elements.", "problem": "In quantum mechanics, particles are classified as either fermions or bosons based on their spin and exchange symmetry. Electrons are fermions, spin-1/2 particles that obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which forbids two identical fermions from occupying the same quantum state. This principle is a cornerstone of our understanding of atomic structure.\n\nLet's imagine a hypothetical universe where the fundamental rules are different. Consider a neutral Beryllium atom, which has an atomic number $Z=4$ and thus possesses 4 electrons. In this alternate universe, electrons are still fundamental particles with an intrinsic spin of $1/2$, but they behave as bosons. This means that the total quantum mechanical wavefunction describing the system of electrons must be symmetric with respect to the interchange of any two electrons.\n\nFor the ground state of this hypothetical \"bosonic\" Beryllium atom, determine the following two quantities:\n1. The number of electrons that will occupy the lowest-energy atomic orbital, which is the 1s orbital.\n2. The value of the total spin quantum number, $S$, for the atom.\n\nProvide your answers as a pair of numbers, with the first number being the electron count in the 1s orbital and the second being the value of $S$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the ground state properties of a hypothetical Beryllium atom where its four electrons behave as bosons.\n\nStep 1: Determine the spatial configuration of the electrons.\nThe ground state of an atom is the state with the lowest possible total energy. In any atom, the orbitals are filled in order of increasing energy. The lowest energy orbital is the 1s orbital.\n\nIn reality, electrons are fermions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state for an electron in an atom is defined by the four quantum numbers $(n, l, m_l, m_s)$. For the 1s orbital, $n=1, l=0, m_l=0$. Since an electron has spin $s=1/2$, the spin projection quantum number $m_s$ can be $+1/2$ or $-1/2$. Thus, for fermions, only two electrons can occupy the 1s orbital.\n\nHowever, in this problem, the electrons are treated as bosons. Bosons do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Any number of identical bosons can occupy the same single-particle quantum state. To achieve the lowest possible energy for the atom, all four electrons will occupy the lowest energy spatial orbital available, which is the 1s orbital.\n\nTherefore, the number of electrons in the 1s orbital is 4. The electronic configuration would be written as $1s^4$.\n\nStep 2: Determine the total spin of the ground state.\nThe total wavefunction of a system of identical particles, $\\Psi$, can be expressed as a product of a spatial part, $\\psi_{spatial}$, and a spin part, $\\chi_{spin}$. So, $\\Psi(1, 2, 3, 4) = \\psi_{spatial}(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2, \\mathbf{r}_3, \\mathbf{r}_4) \\chi_{spin}(1, 2, 3, 4)$.\n\nFor bosons, the total wavefunction $\\Psi$ must be symmetric under the exchange of any two particles.\n\nWe first analyze the symmetry of the spatial part of the wavefunction, $\\psi_{spatial}$. Since all four electrons are in the same spatial orbital (1s), the spatial wavefunction is given by:\n$$\n\\psi_{spatial}(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2, \\mathbf{r}_3, \\mathbf{r}_4) = \\phi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_1) \\phi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_2) \\phi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_3) \\phi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_4)\n$$\nIf we exchange any two particles, say 1 and 2, the wavefunction becomes:\n$$\n\\psi_{spatial}(\\mathbf{r}_2, \\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_3, \\mathbf{r}_4) = \\phi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_2) \\phi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_1) \\phi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_3) \\phi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_4) = \\psi_{spatial}(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2, \\mathbf{r}_3, \\mathbf{r}_4)\n$$\nBecause multiplication is commutative, the spatial part $\\psi_{spatial}$ is inherently symmetric under the exchange of any two particles.\n\nSince the total wavefunction $\\Psi$ must be symmetric, and we have $\\Psi = \\psi_{spatial} \\chi_{spin}$, the following relation must hold for the exchange operation $P_{ij}$:\n$$\nP_{ij}(\\Psi) = \\Psi \\implies P_{ij}(\\psi_{spatial} \\chi_{spin}) = (P_{ij}\\psi_{spatial}) (P_{ij}\\chi_{spin}) = \\psi_{spatial} \\chi_{spin}\n$$\nGiven that $\\psi_{spatial}$ is symmetric ($P_{ij}\\psi_{spatial} = +\\psi_{spatial}$), it must be that the spin wavefunction $\\chi_{spin}$ is also symmetric ($P_{ij}\\chi_{spin} = +\\chi_{spin}$).\n\nWe now need to find the total spin $S$ corresponding to a fully symmetric combination of four spin-$1/2$ particles. When combining multiple spins, the spin configuration with the highest possible total spin value is always the fully symmetric one.\n\nThe total spin quantum number $S$ is obtained by combining the four individual spins of $s=1/2$. The maximum possible value for the total spin projection, $M_S$, occurs when all individual spins are aligned.\n$$\nM_{S, \\text{max}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} m_{s,i} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 2\n$$\nThe state corresponding to this projection, $|\\uparrow\\uparrow\\uparrow\\uparrow\\rangle$, is manifestly symmetric. This state must belong to a spin multiplet with a total spin quantum number $S$ such that $S \\ge |M_{S, \\text{max}}|$. The maximum possible value for $S$ when adding four spin-$1/2$ particles is indeed $S = 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 2$.\nThe multiplet with $S=2$ is a quintet (since $2S+1=5$), and all states belonging to this multiplet are fully symmetric under particle exchange.\n\nThus, for the spin part of the wavefunction to be symmetric, the four electron spins must combine to give a total spin quantum number $S=2$.\n\nSummary of results:\n1.
