One common physical implementation of a qubit is a two-level atom. This state flip can be induced by applying a precisely timed pulse from a laser that is resonant with the atom's transition frequency.\n\nAn engineer is evaluating two laser systems for this purpose. The first system uses a laser with a constant intensity $I_1$ and successfully performs the NOT gate operation in a time interval $t_1$. A second, more powerful laser system with a constant intensity $I_2 = 4 I_1$ is then used. This second system achieves the same NOT gate operation in a time interval $t_2$.\n\nAssume that for both systems, the interaction can be modeled by the electric dipole approximation, where the rate of transition between the states is governed by the Rabi frequency, $\\Omega$. The Rabi frequency is directly proportional to the amplitude of the laser's electric field. Furthermore, the intensity of the laser is proportional to the square of its electric field amplitude.
