This condition is compatible with the Pauli principle requirement.\nThus, the state described by electron 1 having $(m_{l1}, m_{s1})=(2, +1/2)$ and electron 2 having $(m_{l2}, m_{s2})=(2, -1/2)$ is valid.

This means their full set of quantum numbers $(n, l, m_l, m_s)$ would be identical, which is explicitly forbidden by the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\nTherefore, this microstate is NOT allowed.\n\nE. $(M_L, M_S) = (0, -1)$\nTo achieve a total spin $M_S=-1$, both electrons must have spin down: $m_{s1}=-1/2$ and $m_{s2}=-1/2$.\nSince $m_{s1} = m_{s2}$, the Pauli principle requires the orbitals to be different, so $m_{l1} \\neq m_{l2}$.\nTo get a total magnetic quantum number $M_L=0$, we can choose, for example, $m_{l1}=1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$.
