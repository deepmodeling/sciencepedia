To measure its ionization energy, they employ the technique of Photoelectron Spectroscopy (PES). The experiment is conducted in two stages using a gaseous sample of Arganon.\n\nIn the first stage, the gas is irradiated by a monochromatic ultraviolet light source with an unknown photon energy, $E_1$. The photoelectrons ejected from Arganon's outermost valence shell are detected and found to have a kinetic energy of $K_0$.\n\nIn the second stage, the apparatus is modified with a different light source. This new source provides photons with an energy, $E_2$, that is precisely three times the ionization energy, $I_e$, of the Arganon valence electron. When the gas is irradiated with this new source, the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons ejected from the same valence shell is measured to be exactly five times the kinetic energy observed in the first stage.\n\nBased on these experimental findings, determine the ionization energy, $I_e$, of the Arganon valence electron. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $K_0$.", "solution": "The physical principle governing this problem is the photoelectric effect, as applied in Photoelectron Spectroscopy (PES). The energy of an incoming photon is used to overcome the binding energy of an electron and provide it with kinetic energy. The relationship is given by the equation:\n$$K = E_{\\gamma} - I_e$$\nwhere $K$ is the kinetic energy of the ejected photoelectron, $E_{\\gamma}$ is the energy of the incident photon, and $I_e$ is the ionization energy of the electron (also known as the binding energy). We will apply this equation to the two stages of the experiment.\n\nFor the first stage of the experiment, the photon energy is $E_1$, the measured kinetic energy is $K_0$, and the ionization energy of the Arganon valence electron is $I_e$. The governing equation is:\n$$K_0 = E_1 - I_e \\quad (1)$$\n\nFor the second stage of the experiment, the photon energy is $E_2$ and the measured kinetic energy is $K_2$. The governing equation is:\n$$K_2 = E_2 - I_e \\quad (2)$$\n\nThe problem provides two key relationships between the variables in these two stages:\nFirst, the photon energy in the second stage is three times the ionization energy:\n$$E_2 = 3 I_e \\quad (3)$$\nSecond, the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons in the second stage is five times the kinetic energy from the first stage:\n$$K_2 = 5 K_0 \\quad (4)$$\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find $I_e$ in terms of $K_0$. Let's substitute the relations from equations (3) and (4) into equation (2):\n$$5 K_0 = (3 I_e) - I_e$$\n\nNow, we can simplify the right side of this equation:\n$$5 K_0 = 2 I_e$$\n\nFinally, we can solve for the ionization energy, $I_e$, by dividing both sides by 2:\n$$I_e = \\frac{5}{2} K_0$$\n\nThe unknown photon energy from the first experiment, $E_1$, is not required to find the solution, as it is implicitly handled within the system of equations.

The binding energy of a core electron is sensitive to the local chemical environment of the atom.\n\nConsider the following series of simple fluorinated hydrocarbon molecules: ethane ($\\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}_3$), fluoroethane ($\\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}_2\\text{F}$), and 1,1-difluoroethane ($\\text{CH}_3-\\text{CHF}_2$).

For a core level such as C 1s, the dominant trends in chemical shifts are governed by the initial-state effective nuclear charge at the carbon nucleus, $Z_{\\text{eff}}$, which increases when valence electron density at that carbon is withdrawn by electronegative substituents. Qualitatively, reduced electronic screening raises $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ and thus increases $E_{\\text{B}}$. Fluorine, being highly electronegative, withdraws electron density via the inductive effect. The magnitude of this effect is largest for a carbon directly bonded to F (alpha position), decays with distance (beta position smaller), and is approximately additive with the number of F atoms attached to the adjacent or the same carbon.\n\nApplying these principles to the labeled carbons:\n- $C_{A}$ (ethane, $\\text{CH}_{3}\\!-\\!\\text{CH}_{3}$) has no electron-withdrawing substituents; it provides the lowest baseline $E_{\\text{B}}$.\n- In fluoroethane, $C_{B}$ is the methyl carbon beta to a single F. The beta inductive effect slightly raises $E_{\\text{B}}$ over $C_{A}$, so $C_{B} > C_{A}$.\n- In fluoroethane, $C_{C}$ is alpha to one F. The strong alpha inductive effect substantially raises $E_{\\text{B}}$, so $C_{C}$ is higher than both $C_{A}$ and $C_{B}$.\n- In 1,1-difluoroethane, $C_{D}$ is beta to two F. Two beta effects are roughly additive and larger than a single beta effect, so $C_{D} > C_{B}$, but they remain weaker than a single alpha effect, hence $C_{D}  C_{C}$.\n- In 1,1-difluoroethane, $C_{E}$ is alpha to two F. Two alpha inductive effects give the largest withdrawal and the highest $E_{\\text{B}}$, so $C_{E}$ is the highest.\n\nCombining these inequalities yields the overall order from lowest to highest binding energy:\n$$\nC_{A}  C_{B}  C_{D}  C_{C}  C_{E}\n$$\nThis corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2010452"}, {"introduction": "A photoelectron spectrum often contains more than just peaks from direct photoemission; it can also feature signals from a secondary process called Auger emission.
