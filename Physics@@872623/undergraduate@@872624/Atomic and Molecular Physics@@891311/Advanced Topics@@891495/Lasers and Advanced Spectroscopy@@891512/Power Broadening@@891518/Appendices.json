The spectral line associated with this transition has a characteristic width known as the natural linewidth, denoted by $\\Gamma_{nat}$. This width is a fundamental property stemming from the finite lifetime of the excited state due to spontaneous emission. When a high-intensity laser is used to probe this transition, the observed linewidth, $\\Gamma_{power}$, increases due to an effect known as power broadening. For a simple two-level atomic system, the relationship between the power-broadened linewidth, the natural linewidth, and the dimensionless on-resonance saturation parameter $S_0$ is given by the equation:\n$$ \\Gamma_{power} = \\Gamma_{nat} \\sqrt{1 + S_0} $$\nThe saturation parameter $S_0$ is a measure of the laser's intensity relative to the intensity needed to significantly populate the excited state.
