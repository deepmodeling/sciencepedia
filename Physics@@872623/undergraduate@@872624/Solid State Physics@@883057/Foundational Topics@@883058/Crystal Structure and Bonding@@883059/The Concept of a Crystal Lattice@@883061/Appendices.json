This requires you to accurately visualize the unit cell and identify which atoms lie on a given line.", "problem": "In solid-state physics, the arrangement of atoms in a crystalline solid is described by a crystal lattice. One common structure is the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice. In an FCC unit cell, atoms are located at each of the eight corners of a cube and at the center of each of the six faces. The size of this cubic unit cell is defined by the lattice constant, $a$, which is the length of the cube's edge.\n\nThe concept of linear atomic density is used to quantify how closely atoms are packed along a specific direction within the crystal.

This structure can be visualized as a repeating array of regular hexagons, with a carbon atom situated at each vertex. A fundamental concept for describing such periodic structures is the **primitive unit cell**. A primitive unit cell is a region of space (in this case, an area) that, when translated by a specific set of vectors, can perfectly tile the entire structure without any overlaps or gaps. It is the smallest possible repeating unit that captures the full symmetry of the lattice.\n\nGiven this description of the graphene lattice, determine the exact number of carbon atoms contained within a single primitive unit cell.", "solution": "The problem asks for the number of atoms in a primitive unit cell of a 2D honeycomb lattice. A common mistake is to assume the hexagon is the unit cell, or that the answer is simply one. A careful analysis is required.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the structure of the honeycomb lattice. A key property of a true crystal lattice, known as a Bravais lattice, is that every lattice point has an identical environment. If we pick any atom in the honeycomb structure and look at its three nearest neighbors, the bonds to these neighbors have a specific orientation. For example, one bond might point vertically upwards, and the other two might point downwards to the left and right. If we then move to one of those neighbors and examine its environment, we find that its bonds have a different orientation (e.g., one bond pointing vertically downwards and two pointing upwards to the left and right). Since the environment is not identical for every atom, the honeycomb structure itself is **not** a Bravais lattice.\n\nInstead, the honeycomb lattice must be described as a **Bravais lattice with a basis**. This means we can define an underlying lattice of points that *are* all equivalent (the Bravais lattice), and then place an identical group of atoms (the basis) at each of these lattice points to construct the full honeycomb structure.\n\nLet's identify the two distinct types of atomic sites, which we can label 'A' and 'B'. All 'A' sites are equivalent to each other, and all 'B' sites are equivalent to each other, but an 'A' site is not equivalent to a 'B' site due to the different orientation of the surrounding bonds. The set of all 'A' sites forms a Bravais lattice, and the set of all 'B' sites forms an identical, but shifted, Bravais lattice.\n\nWe can choose the Bravais lattice to be the set of points corresponding to the 'A' atoms. This forms a 2D hexagonal lattice. To generate the complete honeycomb structure from this lattice, we need to associate a basis with each lattice point. The basis must contain one 'A' atom (which sits on the lattice point) and one 'B' atom (which is displaced by a short distance, equal to the carbon-carbon bond length). Therefore, the basis for the honeycomb lattice consists of **two atoms**.\n\nBy definition, a primitive unit cell of a crystal structure contains exactly one point of the underlying Bravais lattice and the complete basis associated with that point. Since the basis for the honeycomb lattice contains two atoms, the number of atoms in a primitive unit cell must be two.\n\n**Alternative Geometric Counting Method:**\n\nWe can also arrive at this conclusion by explicitly constructing a primitive unit cell and counting the atoms within it. A primitive unit cell for the underlying hexagonal Bravais lattice (e.g., the lattice of 'A' atoms) is a rhombus. This rhombus is defined by two primitive lattice vectors, $\\vec{a}_1$ and $\\vec{a}_2$, which connect an 'A' atom to two of its non-adjacent, same-type neighbors.\n\nLet's place the vertices of this rhombus on four 'A' atoms.\n- There is one 'A' atom at each of the four corners of the rhombus.\n- In a 2D lattice, an atom at a corner of a unit cell is shared by four adjacent cells.\n- So, the total number of 'A' atoms belonging to this single unit cell is $4 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 1$.\n\nNow, we must consider the 'B' atoms. The geometry of the honeycomb structure is such that inside this rhombus-shaped primitive cell, there is exactly one 'B' atom located entirely within the cell's boundaries. This 'B' atom is not shared with any other cell.\n- The total number of 'B' atoms belonging to this single unit cell is $1$.\n\nThe total number of atoms in the primitive unit cell is the sum of the 'A' and 'B' atoms it contains.\nTotal atoms = (Number of 'A' atoms) + (Number of 'B' atoms) = $1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nBoth methods consistently show that there are two atoms per primitive unit cell in a honeycomb lattice.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "1811353"}]}
