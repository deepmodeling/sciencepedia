Hence $m_{v}$ is not a symmetry (and the equivalent vertical mirror through $x=0$ fails similarly by fractional comparison).\n- Horizontal mirror through $y=\\frac{a}{2}$: $m_{h}(r_{1})=(\\frac{a}{4},\\frac{2a}{3})$, which modulo $a$ has fractional $(\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{2}{3})$ not matching either basis vector, so not a symmetry.\n- Diagonal mirror $y=x$: $m_{d1}(r_{1})=(\\frac{a}{3},\\frac{a}{4})$, fractional $(\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{1}{4})$ does not match $(\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{3})$ or $(\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{2}{3})$, hence not a symmetry (and the other diagonal likewise fails).\n- $C_{4}$ about $C$: $v_{1}:=r_{1}-C=(-\\frac{a}{4},-\\frac{a}{6})$, so $g_{4C}(r_{1})=C+R_{90}v_{1}=(\\frac{a}{2}+\\frac{a}{6},\\frac{a}{2}-\\frac{a}{4})=(\\frac{2a}{3},\\frac{a}{4})$, with fractional $(\\frac{2}{3},\\frac{1}{4})$ not equal to either basis vector; thus $C_{4}$ is broken.\nTherefore, the only nontrivial operation from $C_{4v}$ that survives is the $C_{2}$ rotation; no reflections or $C_{4}$ remain. The point group is precisely $C_{2}$.\n\nOption E: Single atom $r=(\\frac{a}{4},\\frac{a}{3})$.\n- $C_{2}$ about $C$ would require $g_{2C}(r)=(a,a)-r=(\\frac{3a}{4},\\frac{2a}{3})$ to be congruent to $r$ modulo a lattice vector, i.e., $(\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{2}{3})\\equiv(\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{3})$ modulo integers, which is false. About $O$, we would need $-r=r+t$ for some $t\\in L$, i.e., $2r\\in L$, but $2r=(\\frac{a}{2},\\frac{2a}{3})\\notin L$. Hence no $C_{2}$ remains. Generic coordinates also break all mirrors. Thus the point group is $C_{1}$.\n\nConclusion: Only Option D yields a decorated structure whose point group is exactly $C_{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1807431"}]}
