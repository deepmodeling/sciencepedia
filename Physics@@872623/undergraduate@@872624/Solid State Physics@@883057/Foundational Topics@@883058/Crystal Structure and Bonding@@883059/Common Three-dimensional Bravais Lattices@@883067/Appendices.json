{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The distinction between a \"crystal structure\" and a \"Bravais lattice\" is a crucial first step in understanding crystallography. While a Bravais lattice is a purely mathematical concept—an infinite array of equivalent points—a real crystal structure is formed by placing a group of atoms, called a basis, onto each of these points. This exercise [@problem_id:1340512] challenges you to apply this definition to the well-known sodium chloride (NaCl) structure, clarifying why its complete atomic arrangement isn't a Bravais lattice itself, even though it possesses perfect crystalline order. Mastering this distinction is essential for correctly describing and analyzing any crystal.", "problem": "The crystal structure of sodium chloride (NaCl), commonly known as table salt, is a highly ordered, three-dimensional arrangement of sodium (Na$^{+}$) and chloride (Cl$^{-}$) ions. This structure can be described by placing a basis of atoms onto the points of a specific Bravais lattice. While the underlying lattice is a perfect Bravais lattice (specifically, face-centered cubic), the complete set of all atomic positions (both Na$^{+}$ and Cl$^{-}$) in the NaCl crystal does not, by itself, constitute a Bravais lattice.\n\nWhich one of the following statements provides the correct fundamental reason for this distinction?\n\nA. The local environment and orientation around a sodium ion are different from the local environment and orientation around a chloride ion.\nB. A Bravais lattice, by definition, can only be described by a basis containing a single atom.\nC. The strong ionic bonds between Na$^{+}$ and Cl$^{-}$ are inherently directional, which violates the point group symmetry requirements of any Bravais lattice.\nD. The conventional unit cell of NaCl contains eight atoms, whereas the primitive cell of any Bravais lattice must, by definition, contain only one lattice point.\nE. The requirement of overall charge neutrality in the crystal prevents the collection of atomic positions from having the perfect translational symmetry required of a Bravais lattice.", "solution": "1) Definition of a Bravais lattice. A Bravais lattice is a set of points that can be written as\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}=\\{\\mathbf{R}=n_{1}\\mathbf{a}_{1}+n_{2}\\mathbf{a}_{2}+n_{3}\\mathbf{a}_{3}\\,:\\,n_{1},n_{2},n_{3}\\in \\mathbb{Z}\\},\n$$\nwith the defining property that all lattice points are equivalent: there exists a translation by some lattice vector $\\mathbf{R}$ that maps any lattice point to any other and preserves the complete local environment (including species) around the point.\n\n2) NaCl as basis on an fcc Bravais lattice. The NaCl structure can be generated by placing a two-atom basis on an underlying face-centered cubic Bravais lattice $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{fcc}}$. Denote the chloride sublattice by $\\mathcal{C}=\\{\\mathbf{R}:\\mathbf{R}\\in \\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{fcc}}\\}$ and the sodium sublattice by $\\mathcal{N}=\\{\\mathbf{R}+\\boldsymbol{\\delta}:\\mathbf{R}\\in \\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{fcc}}\\}$ with a fixed offset $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}\\notin \\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{fcc}}$. The full set of atomic positions is then\n$$\n\\mathcal{S}=\\mathcal{C}\\cup \\mathcal{N}.\n$$\n\n3) Necessary condition for $\\mathcal{S}$ to be a Bravais lattice. For $\\mathcal{S}$ itself to be a Bravais lattice, there must exist some lattice $\\mathcal{L}'$ such that:\n- Translational invariance: for every $\\mathbf{t}\\in \\mathcal{L}'$ and $\\mathbf{r}\\in \\mathcal{S}$, one has $\\mathbf{r}+\\mathbf{t}\\in \\mathcal{S}$.\n- Point equivalence: for any two points $\\mathbf{r}_{1},\\mathbf{r}_{2}\\in \\mathcal{S}$ there exists $\\mathbf{t}\\in \\mathcal{L}'$ with $\\mathbf{r}_{2}=\\mathbf{r}_{1}+\\mathbf{t}$ such that the local environments (including the chemical identity of neighbors) are identical.\n\n4) Failure of point equivalence in NaCl. Define the nearest-neighbor shell of a site $\\mathbf{r}\\in \\mathcal{S}$ by\n$$\nN(\\mathbf{r})=\\{\\mathbf{r}'\\in \\mathcal{S}:|\\mathbf{r}'-\\mathbf{r}|=r_{1}\\},\n$$\nwhere $r_{1}$ is the smallest nonzero interatomic distance in $\\mathcal{S}$. In NaCl, if $\\mathbf{r}\\in \\mathcal{C}$ (a chloride site), then $N(\\mathbf{r})\\subset \\mathcal{N}$ (all nearest neighbors are sodium). Conversely, if $\\mathbf{r}\\in \\mathcal{N}$ (a sodium site), then $N(\\mathbf{r})\\subset \\mathcal{C}$ (all nearest neighbors are chloride). Therefore, although $\\mathcal{S}$ is periodic, there is no translation that maps a chloride site to a sodium site while preserving the chemical identity of the local environment. Consequently, not all points in $\\mathcal{S}$ are equivalent in the crystallographic sense required of a Bravais lattice.\n\n5) Elimination of the incorrect options. \n- Option B is incorrect because a crystal structure may be built by placing a multi-atom basis on a Bravais lattice; the Bravais lattice itself is a set of equivalent points, not a restriction to a single-atom basis for the full structure.\n- Option C is incorrect because ionic bonding is not inherently directional, and point-group symmetry is not the reason the full set of atomic positions fails to be a Bravais lattice.\n- Option D is incorrect because the number of atoms in a conventional or primitive cell of a structure does not determine whether the set of all atomic positions forms a Bravais lattice; many crystals have more than one atom per primitive cell yet are described on a Bravais lattice with a basis.\n- Option E is incorrect because charge neutrality does not break translational symmetry; NaCl is perfectly periodic and charge neutral within each unit cell.\n\n6) Conclusion. The fundamental reason the full set of Na and Cl atomic positions in NaCl does not constitute a Bravais lattice is that the sodium and chloride sites are not equivalent: their local environments differ by chemical identity of neighbors.

Consider a monatomic crystal with a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) structure. The positions of the atoms can be described using fractional coordinates $(u, v, w)$ with respect to the basis vectors of the conventional cubic unit cell, which has a side length of $a$. In a BCC lattice, atoms are located at coordinates where $(u, v, w)$ are either all integers (describing atoms at the corners of the cubic cells) or all half-integers of the form (integer + 1/2) (describing atoms at the body centers of the cubic cells).\n\nThe planar atomic density for a given crystallographic plane is defined as the number of atoms centered on a representative area within that plane, divided by that area. For a family of planes with Miller indices $(hkl)$, this representative area is typically chosen as a unit cell of the two-dimensional lattice formed by the atoms on that plane.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the planar atomic density of the (110) plane to that of the (100) plane, i.e., $\\frac{\\rho_{110}}{\\rho_{100}}$. Express your answer as a single real number rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the ratio of planar atomic densities, $\\frac{\\rho_{110}}{\\rho_{100}}$, for a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) lattice. We need to calculate the planar density $\\rho$ for the (100) and (110) planes separately and then compute their ratio. The planar density is given by $\\rho = \\frac{N}{A}$, where $N$ is the number of atoms within a chosen unit area $A$ on the plane.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the (100) plane.\nThe family of (100) planes is described by the equation $1 \\cdot u + 0 \\cdot v + 0 \\cdot w = k$, or simply $u = k$, where $k$ is an integer. Let's consider the plane for $k=1$, which corresponds to a face of the conventional unit cell. The area of this face is a square with side length $a$, so the area is $A_{100} = a^2$.\n\nNext, we identify the lattice points that lie on this plane. For a BCC structure, lattice points have fractional coordinates $(u,v,w)$ that are either all integers or all half-integers.\n1. For corner-type points, $(u,v,w)$ are integers. The condition $u=1$ is satisfied by all points of the form $(1, n_2, n_3)$ where $n_2, n_3$ are integers. These points form a square lattice on the plane. The vertices of the unit area on the plane at $u=1$ correspond to the corners of the cube face: $(1,0,0), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (1,1,1)$.\n2. For body-center-type points, $(u,v,w)$ are half-integers, i.e., $(n_1+1/2, n_2+1/2, n_3+1/2)$. The condition $u=1$ becomes $n_1+1/2=1$, which implies $n_1=1/2$. This is not an integer, so no body-center type atoms lie on the (100) planes.\n\nTherefore, the atoms on the (100) plane consist only of the corner-type atoms. The unit area $A_{100}=a^2$ is a square defined by four such atoms at its corners. In a two-dimensional lattice, each corner atom is shared by four adjacent unit cells. Thus, the total number of atoms belonging to this unit area is $N_{100} = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 1$.\nThe planar density of the (100) plane is:\n$$\n\\rho_{100} = \\frac{N_{100}}{A_{100}} = \\frac{1}{a^2}\n$$\n\nNow, let's analyze the (110) plane.\nThe family of (110) planes is described by the equation $u+v=k$, where $k$ is an integer. Let's consider the plane for $k=1$, which passes through the conventional unit cell.\nWe identify the lattice points on this plane:\n1. For corner-type points, we need $u+v=1$, where $u,v$ are integers. Points within the conventional unit cell satisfying this are $(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (1,0,1)$, and $(0,1,1)$. In Cartesian coordinates, these are $(a,0,0), (0,a,0), (a,0,a), (0,a,a)$. These four points form a rectangle that lies within the (110) plane.\n2. For body-center-type points, we need $u+v=1$. Here, $u = n_1+1/2$ and $v = n_2+1/2$. The condition is $(n_1+1/2) + (n_2+1/2) = 1$, which simplifies to $n_1+n_2 = 0$. This equation has integer solutions for $n_1$ and $n_2$ (e.g., $n_1=0, n_2=0$). So, a body-center point with $n_1=0, n_2=0$, which is $(1/2, 1/2, n_3+1/2)$, lies on the plane. The body center of the conventional cell itself, $(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)$, is one such point.\n\nThe representative area on the (110) plane can be chosen as the rectangle with vertices at the Cartesian coordinates $(a,0,0), (0,a,0), (0,a,a), (a,0,a)$.\nThe side lengths of this rectangle are given by the magnitudes of the vectors connecting the vertices.\nSide 1: Vector from $(a,0,0)$ to $(a,0,a)$ is $(0,0,a)$. Length is $a$.\nSide 2: Vector from $(a,0,0)$ to $(0,a,0)$ is $(-a,a,0)$. Length is $\\sqrt{(-a)^2 + a^2 + 0^2} = a\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe area of this rectangle is $A_{110} = a \\times (a\\sqrt{2}) = a^2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNow we count the atoms within this area:\n- There are 4 corner-type atoms at the vertices of the rectangle. Each is shared by 4 adjacent rectangular unit cells on the plane. Their contribution is $4 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 1$.\n- There is one body-center atom at $(a/2, a/2, a/2)$, which is located exactly in the center of this rectangle and is fully contained within it. Its contribution is $1$.\nThe total number of atoms within this area is $N_{110} = 1+1=2$.\nThe planar density of the (110) plane is:\n$$\n\\rho_{110} = \\frac{N_{110}}{A_{110}} = \\frac{2}{a^2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{a^2}\n$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the ratio $\\frac{\\rho_{110}}{\\rho_{100}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho_{110}}{\\rho_{100}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{a^2}}{\\frac{1}{a^2}} = \\sqrt{2}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer as a real number rounded to four significant figures.\n$\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41421356...$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $1.414$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.414}$$", "id": "1765226"}, {"introduction": "While we often think of crystal structures as having fixed properties, many characteristics are sensitive to the precise dimensions of the unit cell.
