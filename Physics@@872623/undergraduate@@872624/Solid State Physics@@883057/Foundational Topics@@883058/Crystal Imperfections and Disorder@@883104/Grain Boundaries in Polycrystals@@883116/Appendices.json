{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A grain boundary represents a region of higher energy compared to the perfect crystal lattice, and this energy has tangible physical consequences. This exercise explores how interfacial energies govern the geometry of a material's surface at the microscopic level. By treating these energies as tensions, you can use a simple force balance analysis to derive the equilibrium shape where a grain boundary meets a free surface, a feature known as a thermal groove [@problem_id:1779758].", "problem": "In the field of materials science, the thermal stability of polycrystalline thin films is crucial for the reliability of microelectronic devices. When such a film is heated (a process known as annealing), atoms can migrate, leading to changes in the surface morphology. Where a grain boundary, which is a planar defect separating two crystal lattices with different orientations, intersects the free surface of the material, a groove tends to form. This process is called thermal grooving.\n\nAt equilibrium, the shape of this groove is determined by a balance of interfacial energies, which can be treated as surface tensions. Let the energy per unit area of the grain boundary be denoted by $\\gamma_{gb}$, and the energy per unit area of the solid-vapor interface (the free surface) be denoted by $\\gamma_{sv}$. Consider a cross-section of the material perpendicular to the line of intersection between the grain boundary and the surface. The system can be analyzed by considering the balance of three tensions acting at the point where the groove root meets the grain boundary.\n\nAssuming the solid-vapor surface energy $\\gamma_{sv}$ is isotropic (i.e., it does not depend on the crystal orientation of the surface) and that the condition $2\\gamma_{sv} > \\gamma_{gb}$ holds, derive an expression for the equilibrium dihedral angle, $\\psi$. The dihedral angle $\\psi$ is defined as the angle at the root of the groove, measured between the tangents to the two free surfaces that meet at the grain boundary. Your final answer should be a symbolic expression for $\\psi$ in terms of $\\gamma_{gb}$ and $\\gamma_{sv}$. Express your final answer for the angle $\\psi$ in radians.", "solution": "The problem asks for the equilibrium dihedral angle $\\psi$ at the root of a thermal groove where a grain boundary intersects a free surface. This equilibrium is achieved when the forces associated with the interfacial tensions are balanced. We can analyze this as a static equilibrium problem in a 2D cross-section.\n\nLet the point where the grain boundary meets the two free surfaces be the origin $(0,0)$. We can model the grain boundary as lying along the negative y-axis. The interfacial energies per unit area, $\\gamma_{gb}$ and $\\gamma_{sv}$, have units of energy/area, which is equivalent to force/length. Thus, we can treat them as tensions (forces per unit length) acting in the 2D cross-section.\n\nThere are three tensions acting at the origin:\n1.  The grain boundary tension, $\\vec{T}_{gb}$, which pulls downwards along the grain boundary. Its magnitude is $\\gamma_{gb}$.\n2.  The tension from the right solid-vapor surface, $\\vec{T}_{sv, R}$. Its magnitude is $\\gamma_{sv}$ and it acts along the tangent to the surface at the origin.\n3.  The tension from the left solid-vapor surface, $\\vec{T}_{sv, L}$. Its magnitude is also $\\gamma_{sv}$ and it acts along the tangent to the other surface at the origin.\n\nThe dihedral angle $\\psi$ is the angle between the two surface tangents. By symmetry, the vertical line of the grain boundary must bisect this angle. Therefore, each surface tangent makes an angle of $\\psi/2$ with the vertical downward direction. Let's set up a coordinate system where the positive y-axis is vertically upwards and the grain boundary lies on the negative y-axis.\n\nThe vectors for the three tensions can be written as:\nThe grain boundary tension acts straight down:\n$$ \\vec{T}_{gb} = -\\gamma_{gb} \\hat{j} $$\n\nThe right surface tangent makes an angle of $\\psi/2$ with the negative y-axis, towards the positive x-axis.
