The definition provided is:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{|r_{\\text{solute}} - r_{\\text{solvent}}|}{r_{\\text{solvent}}}\n$$\n\nFrom the problem statement, we identify the radii for the solute and solvent atoms:\nThe solvent is aluminum (Al), so its radius is $r_{\\text{solvent}} = r_{\\text{Al}} = 0.143 \\text{ nm}$.\nThe solute is magnesium (Mg), so its radius is $r_{\\text{solute}} = r_{\\text{Mg}} = 0.160 \\text{ nm}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the absolute difference in the atomic radii:\n$$\n|r_{\\text{solute}} - r_{\\text{solvent}}| = |r_{\\text{Mg}} - r_{\\text{Al}}| = |0.160 \\text{ nm} - 0.143 \\text{ nm}| = |0.017 \\text{ nm}| = 0.017 \\text{ nm}\n$$\n\nNext, we substitute this difference and the solvent radius into the formula for the relative size difference:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{0.017 \\text{ nm}}{0.143 \\text{ nm}}\n$$\n\nThe units of nanometers (nm) in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving a dimensionless quantity as expected.
