The primary mechanism for creep, a form of slow material deformation at high temperatures, is vacancy-assisted diffusion. The rate of this diffusion process is directly proportional to the equilibrium concentration of atomic vacancies in the crystal lattice.

The substitution of a divalent Ca$^{2+}$ ion for a monovalent K$^{+}$ ion necessitates the formation of cation vacancies to preserve overall electrical neutrality within the crystal lattice. Given that the lattice parameter of the KCl crystal is $a = 0.6292$ nm, determine the resulting concentration of K$^{+}$ vacancies.\n\nExpress your answer in units of vacancies per cubic centimeter (cm$^{-3}$), rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the concentration of cation vacancies in a KCl crystal doped with CaCl$_2$.\n\nFirst, we must understand the defect chemistry involved. When CaCl$_2$ is added to KCl, a Ca$^{2+}$ ion substitutes for a K$^{+}$ ion on a regular cation lattice site. The K$^{+}$ ion has a charge of $+e$, while the Ca$^{2+}$ ion has a charge of $+2e$. To maintain charge neutrality in the crystal, this introduction of an excess positive charge ($+e$) must be compensated by a corresponding negative charge. This compensation is achieved through the creation of a cation vacancy, which is the absence of a K$^{+}$ ion. A missing K$^{+}$ ion leaves behind an effective charge of $-e$ at that site. Therefore, for every one Ca$^{2+}$ ion substitution, one K$^{+}$ vacancy is created. This means the concentration of K$^{+}$ vacancies, $[V_K']$, is equal to the concentration of the dopant Ca$^{2+}$ ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$.\n\nOur goal is to calculate $[Ca^{2+}]$. The dopant level is given as 0.0100 mole percent. This means that the ratio of moles of CaCl$_2$ to moles of KCl is $0.0100 / 100$.\n$$\n\\frac{n_{CaCl_2}}{n_{KCl}} = \\frac{0.0100}{100} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-4}\n$$\nSince the number of particles is proportional to the number of moles ($N = n \\times N_A$), this ratio is the same for the number of CaCl$_2$ formula units and KCl formula units. Each CaCl$_2$ unit provides one Ca$^{2+}$ ion. Thus, the ratio of the number of Ca$^{2+}$ ions to the number of KCl formula units is also $1.00 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n$$\n\\frac{N_{Ca^{2+}}}{N_{KCl}} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-4}\n$$\nTo find the concentration of Ca$^{2+}$ ions (number per unit volume), we can write:\n$$\n[Ca^{2+}] = \\frac{N_{Ca^{2+}}}{V} = \\left(\\frac{N_{Ca^{2+}}}{N_{KCl}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{N_{KCl}}{V}\\right) = (1.00 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times [N_{sites}]\n$$\nwhere $[N_{sites}]$ is the number density of KCl formula units (which is also the number density of cation sites).\n\nNext, we calculate $[N_{sites}]$. The problem states that KCl has the rock-salt structure, which is a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice with a two-atom basis (K$^+$ at (0,0,0) and Cl$^-$ at (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)). A conventional cubic unit cell of an FCC lattice contains 4 lattice points. Therefore, the KCl unit cell contains 4 K$^{+}$ ions and 4 Cl$^{-}$ ions, which amounts to 4 KCl formula units.\nThe volume of this cubic unit cell, $V_{cell}$, is given by $a^3$, where $a$ is the lattice parameter.\n\nWe are given $a = 0.6292$ nm.
