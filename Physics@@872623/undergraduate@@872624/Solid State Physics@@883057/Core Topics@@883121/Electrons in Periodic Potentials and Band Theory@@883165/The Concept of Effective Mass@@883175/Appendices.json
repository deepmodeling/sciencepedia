Therefore, the second derivative must be approximated numerically. The data for the wave vector $k$ is given as a set of uniformly spaced points around $k=0$: $\\{-2h, -h, 0, h, 2h\\}$, where the step size is $h = 1.0\\times 10^{8} \\, \\mathrm{m^{-1}}$.

The energy data provided is also symmetric, $E(h)=E(-h)$. With these conditions, the formula simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2} E}{d k^{2}} \\bigg|_{k=0} = \\frac{2E(h)}{h^{2}}\n$$\nIt is worth noting that for all three cases, the provided energy at $k=2h$ is exactly four times the energy at $k=h$, i.e., $E(2h) = 4E(h)$. This indicates that the data points lie perfectly on a parabola of the form $E(k) = A k^2$, for which the second derivative is a constant $2A$. The chosen finite difference formula is exact for quadratic functions, thus its application here is not an approximation but an exact calculation for the underlying model function from which the data was generated.\n\nThe calculation requires physical constants in SI units.

Take the energy value $E(h)$ at $k=h = 1.0\\times 10^{8} \\, \\mathrm{m^{-1}}$, given in electronvolts ($eV$).\n2.

Calculate the effective mass $m^{\\ast}$ in kilograms ($\\mathrm{kg}$) using $m^{\\ast} = \\hbar^2 / |\\frac{d^{2} E}{d k^{2}}|$.
