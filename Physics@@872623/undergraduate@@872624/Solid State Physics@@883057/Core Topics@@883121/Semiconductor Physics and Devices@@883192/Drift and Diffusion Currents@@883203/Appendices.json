The magnitude of the total drift current is given by the expression:\n$$J_{drift} = |J_{n,drift} + J_{p,drift}|$$\nSince electrons and holes drift in opposite directions under an electric field but have opposite charges, their currents add up. The magnitude of the drift current density for each carrier type is proportional to its concentration, mobility, and the applied electric field $E$.

Assuming full ionization of dopants at $T=300$ K (a standard assumption), the concentration of ionized donors $N_D^+$ equals $N_D$ and the concentration of ionized acceptors $N_A^-$ equals $N_A$.
