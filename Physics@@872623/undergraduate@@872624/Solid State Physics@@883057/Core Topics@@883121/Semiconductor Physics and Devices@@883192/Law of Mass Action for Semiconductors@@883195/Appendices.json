The fundamental principle that governs the relationship between these quantities in a semiconductor at thermal equilibrium is the law of mass action.\n\nThe law of mass action states that the product of the free electron concentration ($n$) and the free hole concentration ($p$) is a constant for a given material at a specific temperature.
