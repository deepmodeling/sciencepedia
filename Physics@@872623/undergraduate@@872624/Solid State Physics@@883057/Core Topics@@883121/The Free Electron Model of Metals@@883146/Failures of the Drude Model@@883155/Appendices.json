In this model, the resistivity of a metal is determined by the scattering of conduction electrons off a stationary lattice of ions. The fundamental constants involved are the electron mass, $m_e$, and the elementary charge, $e$.\n\nLet us imagine two hypothetical metals, Monovalium (Mv) and Divalium (Dv). These metals are designed to be as similar as possible: they possess the same crystal structure, the same atomic number density (number of atoms per unit volume), and the same average time between electron-ion collisions, known as the relaxation time, $\\tau$. The only difference between them is their valence. Monovalium is monovalent, contributing one conduction electron per atom to the electron sea.

The Drude model predicts that $\\rho_{Dv} = \\rho_{Mv}$, because the increased number of charge carriers is perfectly offset by an increased scattering rate.

Hence, the Drude prediction that higher valence (with all else equal) yields lower resistivity is generally not borne out across real materials, where band structure, effective mass, electron-phonon coupling, and scattering mechanisms vary and do not keep $\\tau$ constant across different valences.

While it correctly predicts the sign for many simple metals, it is famously wrong for others, which exhibit a paradoxical positive Hall coefficient, $R_H$. This exercise moves beyond the classical picture by introducing a two-carrier model—a direct consequence of quantum band theory—and asks you to find the conditions under which positive \"hole-like\" carriers can dominate the Hall voltage [@problem_id:1776430]. This practice offers a direct look at why the concept of holes is not just a mathematical convenience but a physical necessity.", "problem": "The Drude model offers a classical picture of electron transport in metals. A key prediction of this model is the Hall coefficient, $R_H = -1/(ne)$, where $n$ is the density of conduction electrons and $-e$ is the elementary charge of an electron. While this prediction is successful for some alkali metals, it fails in intriguing ways for others, highlighting the necessity of a quantum mechanical approach based on band theory.\n\nConsider the case of potassium (K), a monovalent metal with a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) crystal structure. The simple Drude model, assuming one free electron per atom, predicts a negative Hall coefficient. However, experimental measurements performed at low temperatures and in high magnetic fields surprisingly reveal that the Hall coefficient for potassium is positive.\n\nThis paradoxical positive sign can be explained within a more sophisticated framework by a two-carrier model. In this model, the conduction is attributed to two types of charge carriers simultaneously: a group of \"electron-like\" carriers with charge $-e$, effective density $n_e$, and mobility $\\mu_e$, and a group of \"hole-like\" carriers with charge $+e$, effective density $n_h$, and mobility $\\mu_h$. For a system with two such carrier types, the Hall coefficient is given by the expression:\n$$R_H = \\frac{n_h \\mu_h^2 - n_e \\mu_e^2}{e(n_h \\mu_h + n_e \\mu_e)^2}$$\nFor a particular sample of potassium under these experimental conditions, a simplified analysis based on its electronic band structure suggests that the effective densities of the two carrier types are related by the equation $n_e = 2.25 n_h$.\n\nTo account for the experimentally observed positive Hall coefficient, what is the minimum value that the mobility ratio $\\mu_h / \\mu_e$ must exceed? Provide your answer as a real number rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum value of the mobility ratio $\\mu_h / \\mu_e$ that would result in a positive Hall coefficient $R_H$ for potassium, based on a two-carrier model.\n\nThe expression for the Hall coefficient in the two-carrier model is given as:\n$$R_H = \\frac{n_h \\mu_h^2 - n_e \\mu_e^2}{e(n_h \\mu_h + n_e \\mu_e)^2}$$\n\nFor the Hall coefficient $R_H$ to be positive, the numerator of this expression must be positive, as the denominator is always positive. The elementary charge $e$, the carrier densities $n_e$ and $n_h$, and the mobilities $\\mu_e$ and $\\mu_h$ are all defined as positive quantities. Thus, the term $(n_h \\mu_h + n_e \\mu_e)^2$ is always positive.\n\nWe must therefore satisfy the condition:\n$$n_h \\mu_h^2 - n_e \\mu_e^2 > 0$$\n\nWe can rearrange this inequality to analyze the relationship between the mobilities and densities.\n$$n_h \\mu_h^2 > n_e \\mu_e^2$$\n\nTo find the ratio of mobilities, we can divide both sides by $n_h \\mu_e^2$ (which is a positive quantity):\n$$\\frac{\\mu_h^2}{\\mu_e^2} > \\frac{n_e}{n_h}$$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives the condition for the mobility ratio. Since mobilities are positive, we do not need to worry about the direction of the inequality changing.\n$$\\frac{\\mu_h}{\\mu_e} > \\sqrt{\\frac{n_e}{n_h}}$$\n\nThis inequality tells us that for the Hall coefficient to be positive, the ratio of the hole mobility to the electron mobility must be greater than the square root of the ratio of the electron density to the hole density. The question asks for the minimum value that the ratio $\\mu_h / \\mu_e$ must exceed. This value is the boundary of the inequality, which is $\\sqrt{n_e / n_h}$.\n\nThe problem provides the relationship between the effective carrier densities:\n$$n_e = 2.25 n_h$$\n\nFrom this, we can find the ratio of the densities:\n$$\\frac{n_e}{n_h} = 2.25$$\n\nNow, we can substitute this value into our boundary condition expression:\n$$\\text{Minimum value to exceed} = \\sqrt{2.25}$$\n\nCalculating the square root gives:\n$$\\sqrt{2.25} = 1.5$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The value 1.5 can be written as 1.50 to reflect this precision.\n\nThus, the ratio of hole mobility to electron mobility, $\\mu_h / \\mu_e$, must be greater than 1.50 for the Hall coefficient to be positive. This result is physically significant, as it shows that even if the number of hole-like carriers is smaller than the number of electron-like carriers (as $n_h < n_e$), a sufficiently high mobility of these holes can dominate the Hall effect and flip its sign from the negative value predicted by the simple Drude model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.50}$$", "id": "1776430"}]}
