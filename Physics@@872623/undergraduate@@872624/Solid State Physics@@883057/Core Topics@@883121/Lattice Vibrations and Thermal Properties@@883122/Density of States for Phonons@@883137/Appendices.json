This means that every single one of the $N$ vibrational modes in this branch has a frequency of exactly $\\omega_c$.\n\nLet's analyze the implications for $g(\\omega)$:\n1.  For any frequency interval $[\\omega, \\omega+d\\omega)$ that does not include $\\omega_c$, the number of modes must be zero. This is because no modes exist at frequencies other than $\\omega_c$. Therefore, for any $\\omega \\neq \\omega_c$, we must have $g(\\omega) = 0$.\n\n2.  All $N$ modes are concentrated precisely at the frequency $\\omega = \\omega_c$.\n\nThese two conditions define the functional form of $g(\\omega)$. We are looking for a function that is zero everywhere except at a single point $\\omega = \\omega_c$, but whose integral is non-zero. This is the definition of the Dirac delta function.\n\nThe Dirac delta function $\\delta(x - x_0)$ is zero for all $x \\neq x_0$, but has the property that its integral across $x_0$ is 1:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(x - x_0) dx = 1 $$\nWe can scale this function by a constant. A function $A \\delta(x - x_0)$ is zero for all $x \\neq x_0$ and has an integral equal to $A$.\n\nIn our case, the variable is frequency $\\omega$, and the point of interest is $\\omega_c$. The total number of states must be $N$, which is given by the normalization condition:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} g(\\omega)d\\omega = N $$\nWe require a function $g(\\omega)$ that is zero for $\\omega \\neq \\omega_c$ and satisfies this integral condition. The function that fulfills these requirements is:\n$$ g(\\omega) = N \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_c) $$\nLet's verify this.\n- If $\\omega \\neq \\omega_c$, then $\\delta(\\omega - \\omega_c)=0$, so $g(\\omega)=0$. This matches our first observation.\n- The integral is $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} N \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_c) d\\omega = N \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_c) d\\omega$. Since $\\omega_c$ is a positive physical frequency, it lies within the integration domain $[0, \\infty)$, so the integral of the delta function is 1. Thus, $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} g(\\omega)d\\omega = N \\times 1 = N$. This matches the normalization condition.\n\nNow let's examine the given options:\nA. $g(\\omega) = N/\\omega_c$: This is a constant function. It is not zero for $\\omega \\neq \\omega_c$. Its integral is infinite. Incorrect.\nB. $g(\\omega) = C (\\omega_c^2 - \\omega^2)^{-1/2}$: This describes a density of states that is non-zero over a range of frequencies and diverges at $\\omega_c$. This form arises from a sinusoidal dispersion relation $\\omega(k) \\propto |\\sin(ka/2)|$, not a flat one. Incorrect.\nC. $g(\\omega) = C$: This is a step function. It implies modes are distributed uniformly up to $\\omega_c$. This contradicts the fact that all modes are at $\\omega_c$. Incorrect.\nD. $g(\\omega) = N \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_c)$: This matches our derived expression perfectly. Correct.\nE. $g(\\omega) = N$, for $\\omega = \\omega_c$ only, and $g(\\omega) = 0$ otherwise: This describes a function that is a single point. The integral of a single point is zero. It would not satisfy the normalization condition $\\int g(\\omega)d\\omega = N$. The density of states is a *density*, and requires the formalism of a distribution like the Dirac delta function to represent a concentration at a single point with a finite \"weight\" (total number of states).
