A central assumption of the model is that the total number of vibrational modes is finite and corresponds to the number of degrees of freedom of the atoms comprising the solid.\n\nConsider a simple, three-dimensional monatomic crystalline solid. The solid has an atomic number density of $n$. For a sample of this solid with volume $V$, the number of allowed wavevector states in k-space is uniformly distributed, with one state occupying a k-space volume of $(2\\pi)^3/V$. In the Debye approximation, the allowed phonon wavevectors are assumed to populate a sphere in k-space of radius $k_D$, known as the Debye cutoff wavevector. This means that all allowed modes have a wavevector magnitude $|\\vec{k}| \\le k_D$.\n\nYour task is to derive an expression for the Debye cutoff wavevector, $k_D$, as a function of the atomic number density $n$. The derivation must be based on the principle that the total number of allowed vibrational modes within the Debye sphere must equal the total number of translational degrees of freedom for the atoms in the solid.", "solution": "The solution proceeds by first determining the total number of degrees of freedom in the solid and then calculating the total number of vibrational modes allowed within the Debye sphere. By equating these two quantities, we can solve for the Debye cutoff wavevector, $k_D$.\n\nStep 1: Determine the total number of degrees of freedom.\nLet the solid have a volume $V$ and an atomic number density $n$. The total number of atoms, $N$, in the solid is given by the product of the density and the volume:\n$$N = nV$$\nFor a monatomic solid in three dimensions, each atom has three translational degrees of freedom. Therefore, the total number of degrees of freedom for the $N$ atoms is:\n$$\\text{Total degrees of freedom} = 3N = 3nV$$\nAccording to the problem statement, this must be equal to the total number of allowed vibrational modes.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of allowed vibrational modes.\nThe problem states that there is one allowed wavevector state for every k-space volume of $(2\\pi)^3/V$. This means the density of wavevector states in k-space is the reciprocal of this volume, i.e., the number of states per unit volume of k-space is $\\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^3}$.\n\nIn a 3D solid, for each allowed wavevector $\\vec{k}$, there are three distinct vibrational modes (polarizations): one longitudinal and two transverse. Therefore, the number density of vibrational modes in k-space is three times the density of wavevector states:\n$$\\rho_{\\text{modes}}(\\vec{k}) = 3 \\times \\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^3} = \\frac{3V}{8\\pi^3}$$\nThis density is uniform within the Debye sphere.\n\nTo find the total number of modes, we must integrate this density over the entire allowed volume in k-space, which is a sphere of radius $k_D$ (the Debye sphere).\n$$\\text{Total modes} = \\int_{|\\vec{k}| \\le k_D} \\rho_{\\text{modes}}(\\vec{k}) \\,d^3k$$\nSince the density $\\rho_{\\text{modes}}$ is constant, the integral is simply the density multiplied by the volume of the Debye sphere.

The solid sheet has a total area $A$ and is composed of $N$ identical atoms. To model the lattice vibrations (phonons) in this material, we employ the Debye approximation. Within this model, the angular frequency $\\omega$ of a phonon is assumed to have a linear relationship with the magnitude of its wavevector $k$, given by the dispersion relation $\\omega = v_s k$. Here, $v_s$ is the constant speed of sound in the material. This relation is considered valid for all vibrational modes up to a maximum cutoff frequency, known as the Debye frequency.\n\nYour task is to derive the expression for the density of phonon states, $g(\\omega)$, for this 2D material. The density of states is defined such that $g(\\omega)d\\omega$ represents the number of distinct vibrational modes with angular frequencies in the interval between $\\omega$ and $\\omega+d\\omega$.

The number of states with a wavevector magnitude less than or equal to $k$ is found by dividing the area of a circle of radius $k$ in k-space by the area per state.\n$$N(k) = \\frac{\\text{Area of circle}}{\\text{Area per state}} = \\frac{\\pi k^2}{4\\pi^2/A} = \\frac{A k^2}{4\\pi}$$\nThis expression gives the number of allowed wavevectors $\\vec{k}$ whose magnitude $|\\vec{k}|$ is less than $k$.\n\nThe number of states $dN_k$ within a thin annular ring in k-space, between radius $k$ and $k+dk$, is found by differentiating $N(k)$ with respect to $k$:\n$$dN_k = \\frac{dN(k)}{dk} dk = \\frac{d}{dk}\\left(\\frac{A k^2}{4\\pi}\\right) dk = \\frac{2Ak}{4\\pi} dk = \\frac{A k}{2\\pi} dk$$\n\nFor a 2D lattice of atoms, each atom has two degrees of freedom for motion in the plane. This gives rise to two independent polarization modes for each wavevector $\\vec{k}$ (one longitudinal and one transverse, or two transverse in some contexts). The Debye model typically simplifies this by assuming a number of degenerate modes. For a 2D monoatomic lattice with $N$ atoms, there are a total of $2N$ vibrational modes. This means we must account for two polarization states for each wavevector. Therefore, the total number of modes in the interval from $k$ to $k+dk$ is twice $dN_k$:\n$$dN = 2 \\times dN_k = 2 \\times \\frac{A k}{2\\pi} dk = \\frac{A k}{\\pi} dk$$\n\nThe problem defines the density of states $g(\\omega)$ in terms of frequency, such that $dN = g(\\omega)d\\omega$. We need to convert our expression from being a function of $k$ to a function of $\\omega$. The Debye approximation provides the linear dispersion relation:\n$$\\omega = v_s k$$\nFrom this, we can express $k$ and $dk$ in terms of $\\omega$ and $d\\omega$:\n$$k = \\frac{\\omega}{v_s} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad dk = \\frac{d\\omega}{v_s}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions back into the equation for $dN$:\n$$dN = \\frac{A}{\\pi} \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{v_s}\\right) \\left(\\frac{d\\omega}{v_s}\\right) = \\frac{A \\omega}{\\pi v_s^2} d\\omega$$\n\nBy comparing this with the definition $dN = g(\\omega)d\\omega$, we can identify the density of states $g(\\omega)$:\n$$g(\\omega) = \\frac{A \\omega}{\\pi v_s^2}$$\nThis expression is valid for $\\omega$ up to the Debye cutoff frequency $\\omega_D$.
