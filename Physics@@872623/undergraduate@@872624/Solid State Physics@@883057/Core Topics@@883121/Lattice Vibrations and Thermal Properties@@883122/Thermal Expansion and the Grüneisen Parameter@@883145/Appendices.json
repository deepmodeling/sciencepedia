At zero temperature, the atoms are located at equilibrium positions separated by a distance $a_0$. The potential energy $U(x)$ of an atom due to its interaction with neighbors, as a function of its displacement $x$ from its equilibrium lattice site, is given by the anharmonic potential:\n$$U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 - \\frac{1}{3}gx^3$$\nwhere $k$ and $g$ are positive constants representing the harmonic restoring force and the lowest-order anharmonicity, respectively. The asymmetry introduced by the anharmonic term leads to thermal expansion at finite temperatures. This effect is quantified by the Grüneisen parameter, $\\gamma$.\n\nYour task is to find a closed-form analytic expression for the Grüneisen parameter for this 1D system in terms of the given parameters $a_0$, $k$, and $g$.\n\nTo solve this, use the following definitions and relations appropriate for this 1D model in the high-temperature classical limit:\n1.  The Grüneisen parameter is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{\\alpha B_T V_{at}}{C_V}$.\n2.  $\\alpha$ is the coefficient of linear thermal expansion, given by $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{a_0} \\frac{d\\langle x \\rangle}{dT}$, where $\\langle x \\rangle$ is the thermally-averaged displacement of an atom.\n3.  $B_T$ is the isothermal bulk modulus, for which you should use the relation $B_T = a_0 k$.\n4.  $V_{at}$ is the \"volume\" per atom, which in 1D is the equilibrium separation, $V_{at} = a_0$.\n5.  $C_V$ is the heat capacity per atom at constant volume. In the high-temperature classical limit, its value is equal to the Boltzmann constant, $C_V = k_B$.\n6.  The average displacement $\\langle x \\rangle$ at a temperature $T$ is calculated using classical statistical mechanics as:\n$$\\langle x \\rangle = \\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x \\exp\\left(-\\frac{U(x)}{k_B T}\\right) dx}{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{U(x)}{k_B T}\\right) dx}$$\nYou may assume that the temperature is sufficiently high such that the thermal energy $k_B T$ is large compared to the typical energy contribution from the anharmonic term.

This implies a direct relationship between $\\omega_s$ and $V$. The rate of change of the frequency with respect to volume, $\\frac{d\\omega_s}{dV}$, must therefore be positive.\n\nNow let's analyze the sign of each term in the expression for $\\gamma_s$:\n- The volume $V$ is positive.\n- The frequency $\\omega_s$ is positive.\n- The derivative $\\frac{d\\omega_s}{dV}$ is positive, as we just determined.\n\nSubstituting these signs into the equation for $\\gamma_s$:\n$$ \\gamma_s = - \\frac{(\\text{positive})}{(\\text{positive})} \\times (\\text{positive}) $$\nThe entire expression is prefixed by a negative sign, so $\\gamma_s$ must be negative.\n\nSince $\\gamma \\approx \\gamma_s$, the overall Grüneisen parameter $\\gamma$ is also negative.\nAs established earlier, the sign of the volume thermal expansion coefficient $\\beta$ is the same as the sign of $\\gamma$. Therefore, $\\beta$ is negative.\n\nThe physical meaning of a negative coefficient of volume thermal expansion ($\\beta = \\frac{1}{V} (\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial T})_P  0$) is that the volume of the material decreases as its temperature increases.
