It is defined such that $g(\\omega)d\\omega$ gives the number of vibrational normal modes (phonons) with angular frequencies in the range from $\\omega$ to $\\omega + d\\omega$. The Einstein model, one of the earliest quantum theories of solids, makes a specific assumption about the vibrations of the $N$ atoms in a crystal lattice. This assumption leads to a particular functional form for the Einstein density of states, $g_E(\\omega)$. In contrast, more realistic descriptions of three-dimensional (3D) crystals, supported by experimental measurements, reveal a different structure for the density of states, which we will call $g_R(\\omega)$.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate comparison between the key features of the vibrational density of states for the Einstein model, $g_E(\\omega)$, and that of a typical realistic 3D crystal, $g_R(\\omega)$?\n\nA. Both models assume a continuous distribution of frequencies, but the Einstein model uses a linear distribution ($g_E(\\omega) \\propto \\omega$) while realistic models use a quadratic one ($g_R(\\omega) \\propto \\omega^2$).\n\nB.

This relationship is known as the phonon dispersion relation.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the core assumption of the Einstein model. In this model, every atom in the solid is treated as an independent quantum harmonic oscillator, and crucially, all these oscillators share the exact same angular frequency, $\\omega_E$.\n\nThe energy of a quantum harmonic oscillator is quantized. The energy levels are given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_E$, where $n$ is an integer quantum number. A phonon is a quantum of vibrational energy. The creation of a single phonon corresponds to an oscillator transitioning from a state with quantum number $n$ to $n+1$.

We are told the scattering event creates a single phonon.\n\nLet the initial energy and momentum of the neutron be $E_i$ and $\\vec{p}_i$, and the final energy and momentum be $E_f$ and $\\vec{p}_f$. The energy and momentum of the created phonon are $E_{phonon}$ and $\\vec{p}_{phonon}$.\n\nThe conservation of energy dictates:\n$$ E_i = E_f + E_{phonon} $$\nThe energy transfer $\\Delta E$ from the neutron to the crystal is defined as the energy lost by the neutron, which is equal to the energy of the created phonon:\n$$ \\Delta E = E_i - E_f = E_{phonon} $$\n\nThe conservation of momentum dictates:\n$$ \\vec{p}_i = \\vec{p}_f + \\vec{p}_{phonon} $$\nThe momentum transferred from the neutron to the crystal is the momentum of the created phonon. The momentum of a phonon is related to its wavevector $\\vec{q}$ by $\\vec{p}_{phonon} = \\hbar\\vec{q}$. The momentum transfer from the neutron is:\n$$ \\hbar\\Delta\\vec{k} = \\vec{p}_i - \\vec{p}_f = \\vec{p}_{phonon} = \\hbar\\vec{q} $$\nThis implies that the momentum transfer wavevector $\\Delta\\vec{k}$ is identical to the phonon's wavevector $\\vec{q}$. So, the magnitude of the momentum transfer wavevector is $\\Delta k = |\\Delta\\vec{k}| = |\\vec{q}| = q$.\n\nNow we combine these insights. The energy of the created phonon is $E_{phonon} = \\hbar\\omega_E$. The energy transfer measured in the experiment is $\\Delta E = E_{phonon}$. Therefore:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\hbar\\omega_E $$\nThis equation shows that the energy transfer $\\Delta E$ is a constant value, completely independent of the phonon wavevector magnitude $q$, and thus independent of the measured momentum transfer wavevector magnitude $\\Delta k$. The dispersion relation $\\Delta E(\\Delta k)$ is a constant function.\n\nThis result highlights a key failure of the Einstein model. In real materials, atoms are coupled, allowing vibrations to propagate as waves.
