## Introduction
Magnetic [hysteresis](@entry_id:268538) is a defining characteristic of [ferromagnetic materials](@entry_id:261099), representing a memory of their magnetic history. This behavior, where a material's magnetic state lags behind an applied magnetic field, is the foundation upon which countless modern technologies are built, from [permanent magnets](@entry_id:189081) in [electric motors](@entry_id:269549) to the data bits on a hard drive. While this response can be visualized with a hysteresis loop, a deeper understanding of the loop's features is critical. Why do some materials retain magnetism strongly, while others are easily demagnetized? This article addresses this question by focusing on two key parameters that quantify this behavior: [remanence](@entry_id:158654) and [coercivity](@entry_id:159399).

This article provides a comprehensive exploration of these foundational concepts. The first chapter, "Principles and Mechanisms," will formally define [remanence](@entry_id:158654) and [coercivity](@entry_id:159399), delve into their microscopic origins within [magnetic domains](@entry_id:147690), and explain the energy dynamics of the hysteresis loop. Following this, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" will demonstrate how these properties distinguish between [hard and soft magnets](@entry_id:144016), enabling technologies from data storage to efficient power transformers, and will also explore analogous phenomena in other areas of physics. Finally, the "Hands-On Practices" section offers an opportunity to apply this theoretical knowledge to solve practical problems in magnetism. We begin by establishing the core principles that govern the shape and meaning of the hysteresis loop.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The phenomenon of [magnetic hysteresis](@entry_id:145766) is a hallmark of ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials, distinguishing them fundamentally from paramagnetic and diamagnetic substances. While the previous chapter introduced the general concept, we now delve into the core principles that define the features of the [hysteresis loop](@entry_id:160173) and the microscopic mechanisms responsible for this behavior. Understanding these principles is paramount for the design and application of magnetic materials, from soft magnets in transformers to hard magnets in data storage.

### Defining the Hysteresis Loop: Remanence and Coercivity

The response of a magnetic material to an external magnetic field is most completely characterized by its **hysteresis loop**. This loop is a plot of the material's internal magnetic state—represented by either the [magnetic flux density](@entry_id:194922), $B$, or the magnetization, $M$—as a function of the externally applied magnetic field strength, $H$. As a [ferromagnetic material](@entry_id:271936) is subjected to a cyclically varying external field, its response ($B$ or $M$) lags behind the driving field, tracing a closed loop instead of a single, reversible curve.

From this loop, we extract two of the most important parameters that define a magnetic material's performance. Consider a material that has been magnetized to saturation by a large positive field, $+H_{max}$. As the external field is reduced, the [magnetic flux density](@entry_id:194922) does not return to zero.

*   The **[remanence](@entry_id:158654)**, denoted as $B_r$, is the residual [magnetic flux density](@entry_id:194922) that remains in the material after the external magnetic field strength $H$ is brought to zero. It represents the material's ability to retain its magnetism.

*   To reduce this remanent magnetism to zero, one must apply a magnetic field in the opposite direction. The **[coercivity](@entry_id:159399)**, or [coercive field](@entry_id:160296), denoted as $H_c$, is the magnitude of the reverse magnetic field strength required to completely demagnetize the material, i.e., to reduce its [magnetic flux density](@entry_id:194922) $B$ to zero. It quantifies the material's resistance to demagnetization.

It is crucial to be precise with the units of these quantities. The relationship between $B$, $H$, and the material's magnetization $M$ is given by the [constitutive relation](@entry_id:268485):
$$B = \mu_0 (H + M)$$
where $\mu_0$ is the [permeability of free space](@entry_id:276113). By definition, the [magnetic flux density](@entry_id:194922) $B$ is measured in **teslas (T)** in the SI system. The magnetic field strength $H$ and the magnetization $M$ ([magnetic dipole moment](@entry_id:149826) per unit volume) are both measured in **amperes per meter (A/m)**. From these definitions, it directly follows that the [remanence](@entry_id:158654) $B_r$, being a specific value of the flux density $B$, is measured in teslas. Conversely, the [coercivity](@entry_id:159399) $H_c$, being a specific value of the applied field strength $H$, is measured in amperes per meter [@problem_id:1783075]. An analogous M-H loop can be plotted, in which case the remanent magnetization $M_r$ is also measured in A/m.

This hysteretic behavior is exclusive to materials with cooperative [magnetic ordering](@entry_id:143206). Paramagnetic and [diamagnetic materials](@entry_id:264470), for instance, lack this property. In a paramagnet, atomic moments align weakly with an applied field, resulting in a small, positive magnetization ($M = \chi_p H$ with $\chi_p > 0$) that vanishes immediately upon removal of the field. In a diamagnet, an even weaker negative magnetization is induced ($M = \chi_d H$ with $\chi_d  0$), which also disappears when $H=0$. For both, the $M-H$ plot is a straight line through the origin, meaning they exhibit neither [remanence](@entry_id:158654) nor coercivity. Only a material like a ferromagnet, which shows a strong cooperative alignment of moments, will exhibit a non-zero [remanence](@entry_id:158654) and coercivity [@problem_id:1783076].

### Microscopic Origins: The Role of Magnetic Domains

The macroscopic [hysteresis loop](@entry_id:160173) is the aggregate result of complex processes occurring at the microscopic level of magnetic domains. A magnetic domain is a region within a crystal in which the magnetic moments of the atoms are aligned in a uniform direction. In an unmagnetized sample, these domains are oriented randomly, or in patterns that close the magnetic flux paths, such that the net macroscopic magnetization is zero.

The process of magnetizing a material from this virgin state traces a path known as the **initial magnetization curve**. This curve is fundamentally different from the branches of the major [hysteresis loop](@entry_id:160173) that is traced after saturation.
*   In the initial, low-field region, magnetization proceeds primarily through the **reversible motion of [domain walls](@entry_id:144723)**. Domain walls are the transition regions between domains. Walls that are favorably oriented with respect to the applied field expand at the expense of unfavorably oriented ones. This motion is often reversible for very small field changes.
*   As the field increases, the process becomes dominated by **irreversible [domain wall](@entry_id:156559) motion**. This is the steep, central part of the initial curve. Domain walls break free from pinning sites—such as [crystal defects](@entry_id:144345), impurities, or [grain boundaries](@entry_id:144275)—and sweep through large regions of the crystal. This process is not smooth and often occurs in discrete jumps, known as Barkhausen jumps. This irreversibility is the origin of [hysteresis](@entry_id:268538) [@problem_id:1783100].
*   At higher fields, as most domain walls have been swept from the material, the final approach to saturation occurs via the **rotation of magnetization** within the remaining domains, aligning them fully with the external field.

Once the material is saturated and the field is reversed, the path does not retrace the initial curve. The [irreversibility](@entry_id:140985) of domain wall motion means the system is "stuck" in a higher-magnetization state, leading to [remanence](@entry_id:158654) at $H=0$. To bring the net magnetization to zero at the [coercive field](@entry_id:160296), $-H_c$, a common misconception is that the magnetic moments within each domain are somehow nullified. This is incorrect. At coercivity, the individual domains remain magnetized close to their saturation value. The zero net magnetization arises because the reverse field has reoriented a sufficient volume fraction of the magnetic domains to point in the new field direction, such that their collective magnetic moment perfectly cancels the moment of the domains that have not yet reoriented [@problem_id:1783103]. The state at $H=-H_c$ is therefore a complex domain structure with a net vector sum of zero magnetization, not a return to the original, random demagnetized state.

### Energetics of Hysteresis

The irreversible nature of [domain wall](@entry_id:156559) motion implies that magnetizing a [ferromagnetic material](@entry_id:271936) is an energy-dissipative process. When the external magnetic field drives the material around a full [hysteresis cycle](@entry_id:190185), a net amount of energy is transferred to the material and dissipated as heat. It can be shown from electromagnetic theory that the work done per unit volume, $W_v$, in taking a material through one full cycle is equal to the area enclosed by the B-H hysteresis loop:
$$W_v = \oint H \, dB$$
If one considers the M-H loop, the energy dissipated per unit volume is given by $\mu_0 \oint H \, dM$.

This energy loss is a critical factor in many engineering applications. For example, in a toroidal core of a high-frequency power supply, this cyclic energy loss manifests as heat generation. The total power dissipated, $P$, is the product of the energy loss per cycle per volume ($W_v$), the volume of the core ($V$), and the operating frequency ($f$) [@problem_id:1783080]. For [soft magnetic materials](@entry_id:159225), which are used in such applications, a narrow [hysteresis loop](@entry_id:160173) is desired to minimize these losses. Conversely, for permanent magnets, a wide loop is desirable, as we will see.

The energy considerations also apply to partial traversals of the loop. For instance, the energy density required to demagnetize a material from its remanent state ($M=M_r$ at $H=0$) to a state of zero magnetization ($M=0$ at $H=-H_c$) is given by the work done by the field source. This work is calculated by integrating along the corresponding path on the M-H loop [@problem_id:1783106]:
$$W = \int_{M_r}^{0} \mu_0 H \, dM$$
This integral represents the area between the M-axis and the upper branch of the M-H curve, from $M=M_r$ down to $M=0$.

### Mechanisms of Coercivity

Coercivity is not an intrinsic, fixed property of a magnetic compound but is highly dependent on the material's [microstructure](@entry_id:148601). It reflects the difficulty of reversing the magnetization. Materials with low [coercivity](@entry_id:159399) are "soft" magnets, easily magnetized and demagnetized. Materials with high [coercivity](@entry_id:159399) are "hard" magnets, difficult to demagnetize and suitable for use as [permanent magnets](@entry_id:189081). The physical mechanisms that create this resistance to reversal differ depending on the material's structure.

#### Domain Wall Pinning

In bulk materials that are large enough to contain multiple domains, coercivity is often governed by the **pinning of domain walls**. Crystalline imperfections such as impurities, non-magnetic inclusions, [grain boundaries](@entry_id:144275), and dislocations create local energy minima or maxima for a domain wall. To move a wall past these pinning sites, the applied magnetic field must exert sufficient pressure. This magnetic pressure, $P_{mag}$, on a $180^\circ$ [domain wall](@entry_id:156559) is given by $P_{mag} = 2\mu_0 M_s H$.

This pressure is resisted by the pinning forces. A useful model envisions the [domain wall](@entry_id:156559), which possesses a surface tension equal to its energy per unit area $\gamma_{dw}$, bowing out between pinning sites. The curvature of the wall creates a restoring pressure, analogous to the Laplace pressure in a fluid droplet. For a wall bowing with a radius of curvature $R$, this pressure is $P_{wall} = \gamma_{dw}/R$. The [coercive field](@entry_id:160296) $H_c$ is the field at which the [magnetic pressure](@entry_id:272413) is sufficient to make the wall break away from the pins. This typically occurs at a critical radius of curvature related to the average distance $L$ between pinning sites. A simple model assuming $L \approx n^{-1/3}$ for a defect density $n$ yields a [coercivity](@entry_id:159399) of [@problem_id:1783107]:
$$H_c = \frac{\gamma_{dw} n^{1/3}}{\mu_0 M_s}$$
This model provides a powerful insight: [coercivity](@entry_id:159399) can be engineered by controlling the [microstructure](@entry_id:148601). Introducing a fine dispersion of defects (increasing $n$) is a common strategy to increase the coercivity and create a harder magnetic material.

#### Coherent Rotation

When a magnetic particle is made smaller than a critical size (typically on the nanoscale), it becomes energetically unfavorable to form a [domain wall](@entry_id:156559). Such a particle exists as a **single-domain** particle. In this case, magnetization reversal cannot proceed by domain wall motion. Instead, the entire [magnetization vector](@entry_id:180304) of the particle must rotate coherently as a single unit.

This rotation must overcome the material's **[magnetocrystalline anisotropy](@entry_id:144488)**, which is an [intrinsic property](@entry_id:273674) that defines certain [crystallographic directions](@entry_id:137393) as "easy" or "hard" axes of magnetization. The energy required to rotate the magnetization away from an easy axis is described by an anisotropy constant, $K_u$. For a particle with uniaxial anisotropy, the celebrated **Stoner-Wohlfarth model** predicts that the [coercivity](@entry_id:159399) for a field applied along the easy axis is given by [@problem_id:1783104]:
$$H_c = \frac{2K_u}{\mu_0 M_s}$$
Typically, the [magnetocrystalline anisotropy](@entry_id:144488) energy can be very large, especially in materials containing [rare-earth elements](@entry_id:150323). Consequently, the coercivity achieved through coherent rotation in single-domain nanoparticles is often significantly higher than that achievable through [domain wall pinning](@entry_id:138291) in bulk materials. This is the principle behind many modern high-performance [permanent magnets](@entry_id:189081) used in [electric motors](@entry_id:269549) and magnetic recording media.

### External Influences on Hysteresis

The shape and size of the hysteresis loop are not immutable but can be significantly altered by external conditions such as temperature and mechanical stress.

#### Temperature Effects

Thermal energy competes with the exchange interaction that causes cooperative magnetic alignment. As the temperature of a [ferromagnetic material](@entry_id:271936) is increased, thermal fluctuations make it progressively easier for atomic moments to deviate from their aligned state. This leads to a decrease in the [saturation magnetization](@entry_id:143313), $M_s$. Consequently, the remanent magnetization, $M_r$, and the coercivity, $H_c$, also decrease with increasing temperature.

At a critical temperature known as the **Curie Temperature ($T_C$)**, the thermal energy becomes strong enough to completely overcome the [exchange interaction](@entry_id:140006). The material loses its ferromagnetic ordering and becomes paramagnetic. At and above $T_C$, [hysteresis](@entry_id:268538) vanishes, and both $M_r$ and $H_c$ become zero. The decay of these properties as the temperature approaches $T_C$ can often be described by empirical power-law relations of the form [@problem_id:1783102]:
$$M_r(T) \approx M_{r0} \left(1 - \frac{T}{T_C}\right)^{\beta} \quad \text{and} \quad H_c(T) \approx H_{c0} \left(1 - \frac{T}{T_C}\right)^{\gamma}$$
where $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are material-dependent exponents. This temperature dependence is a critical consideration for any application of magnetic materials that must operate over a range of temperatures.

#### Magnetoelastic Effects

Magnetic and mechanical properties in materials are often coupled. **Magnetostriction** is the phenomenon where a magnetic material changes its physical dimensions when it is magnetized. The inverse effect, known as the **magnetoelastic effect** or Villari effect, is that applying a mechanical stress to a magnetostrictive material can alter its magnetic properties.

Specifically, an applied stress $\sigma$ can induce an additional source of magnetic anisotropy. For a material with a saturation [magnetostriction](@entry_id:143327) constant $\lambda_s$, an applied uniaxial stress induces an [anisotropy energy](@entry_id:200263) density of the form $E_{\sigma} \propto -\lambda_s \sigma \cos^2\phi$, where $\phi$ is the angle between the magnetization and the stress axis. This stress-induced anisotropy adds to the material's intrinsic [magnetocrystalline anisotropy](@entry_id:144488), $K_u$. The total effective anisotropy constant, $K_{eff}$, can be written as [@problem_id:1783060]:
$$K_{eff} = K_u + \frac{3}{2}\lambda_s \sigma$$
(where a tensile stress $\sigma$ is positive). Since [coercivity](@entry_id:159399) is directly related to the energy barriers for magnetization reversal, it is often proportional to this effective anisotropy constant. Therefore, applying a mechanical stress can directly modify the coercivity. For a material with positive $\lambda_s$, a tensile stress ($\sigma > 0$) will increase the effective anisotropy and thus the coercivity. Conversely, a compressive stress ($\sigma  0$) would decrease it. This [magnetoelastic coupling](@entry_id:268985) is the basis for many sensor and actuator technologies.
