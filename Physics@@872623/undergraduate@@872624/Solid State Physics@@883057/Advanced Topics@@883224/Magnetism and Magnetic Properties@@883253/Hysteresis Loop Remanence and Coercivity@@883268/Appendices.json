This practice explores its origin by modeling a single magnetic domain as a particle with a preferred \"easy\" axis of magnetization, a concept described by magnetic anisotropy. By analyzing the total energy of the particle—a sum of its internal anisotropy energy and its interaction energy with an external field—you will determine the critical field strength at which the initial magnetization becomes unstable, thus deriving an expression for coercivity from first principles [@problem_id:1783069].", "problem": "Consider a single-domain ferromagnetic nanoparticle, a fundamental component in advanced magnetic data storage. The particle exhibits uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, meaning it has a single \"easy axis\" along which the magnetization prefers to align. The magnetic anisotropy energy density, $E_A$, is given by the expression $E_A = K_1 \\sin^2(\\theta)$, where $K_1$ is the positive first-order uniaxial anisotropy constant and $\\theta$ is the angle between the magnetization vector $\\vec{M}$ and the easy axis. The magnitude of the magnetization is fixed at its saturation value, $M_s$.\n\nThe nanoparticle is initially in a state of zero external magnetic field, with its magnetization fully aligned along the easy axis (i.e., at $\\theta = 0$). To reverse the magnetization, an external magnetic field $\\vec{H}$ is applied exactly antiparallel to the easy axis. The magnetization reversal is assumed to occur via coherent rotation, where all atomic magnetic moments within the particle rotate in unison.\n\nThe total magnetic energy density $E$ of the nanoparticle in the presence of the field is the sum of the anisotropy energy and the Zeeman energy, $E = E_A - \\mu_0\\vec{M} \\cdot \\vec{H}$.
