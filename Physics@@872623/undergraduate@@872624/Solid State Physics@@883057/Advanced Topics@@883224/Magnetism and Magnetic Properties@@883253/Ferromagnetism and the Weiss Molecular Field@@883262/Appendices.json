It provides all necessary information to compute the saturation magnetization of a ferromagnetic material under the given model.\n\nThe saturation magnetization, $M_s$, is defined as the maximum possible magnetic dipole moment per unit volume. This state is achieved at temperature $T=0$, where thermal fluctuations are absent, and an applied or internal field (the Weiss molecular field) aligns all individual magnetic moments parallel to each other.\n\nThe magnetization $M$ is given by:\n$$\nM = n \\langle \\mu \\rangle\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the number density of magnetic ions and $\\langle \\mu \\rangle$ is the average magnetic moment per ion along the direction of magnetization. At $T=0$, all moments are perfectly aligned, so $\\langle \\mu \\rangle$ is simply the maximum component of the magnetic moment of a single ion, $\\mu_{ion}$. Thus, the saturation magnetization is:\n$$\nM_s = n \\cdot \\mu_{ion}\n$$\n\nThe magnetic moment of an individual ion arises from the spin of its electrons, as the problem states that orbital contributions are quenched.

The negative sign indicates that the magnetic moment is directed opposite to the spin angular momentum, which is conventional for electrons due to their negative charge. However, in the context of saturation magnetization, we are interested in the magnitude of the maximum projection of the moment along the alignment axis.\n\nThe component of the spin angular momentum along a quantization axis (say, the $z$-axis) is quantized. Its eigenvalues are $S_z = m_S \\hbar$, where $m_S$ is the magnetic spin quantum number, which can take values from $-S$ to $+S$ in integer steps.\nThe component of the magnetic moment along this axis is therefore:\n$$\n\\mu_z = -g \\mu_B \\frac{S_z}{\\hbar} = -g \\mu_B m_S\n$$\nFor complete alignment, we consider the maximum possible value of the magnetic moment component along the direction of the field. This corresponds to the spin state with the maximum value for the spin quantum number projection, which is $m_S=S$.
