By analyzing this contrast, you will develop a crucial intuition for magnetocrystalline anisotropy and understand why it is fundamentally responsible for the orientation-dependent nature of magnetostriction.", "problem": "An engineer is studying the magnetostrictive properties of a novel ferromagnetic alloy. Magnetostriction is the phenomenon where a material changes its dimensions when subjected to a magnetic field. The engineer prepares two samples, Sample C and Sample A, from the same alloy.\n\nSample C is a carefully grown single crystal, shaped into a long, thin rod. Due to its ordered atomic structure, it exhibits strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy. This means the energy required to magnetize the material, and the resulting fractional change in length (strain), depends strongly on the orientation of the applied magnetic field relative to the crystal's internal axes.\n\nSample A is an amorphous metallic glass of the same alloy, also shaped into an identical long, thin rod. In this sample, the atoms are frozen in a disordered, non-crystalline arrangement, meaning there is no long-range periodic lattice and thus no global crystallographic axes.\n\nIn the experiment, a strong, uniform external magnetic field is applied along the long axis of a sample rod, causing it to reach magnetic saturation. The fractional change in the rod's length, defined as the magnetostriction $\\lambda = \\frac{\\Delta L}{L}$, is measured. The experiment is performed on both Sample C and Sample A. For each sample, the measurement is repeated multiple times. Between each measurement, the rod is rotated by a random angle about an axis perpendicular to its length, and then the magnetic field is reapplied along the rod's axis for the new measurement.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected observations for the measured magnetostriction values for the two samples?\n\nA. Sample A will exhibit zero magnetostriction in all orientations because the absence of a crystal lattice prevents the effect, while Sample C will show varying magnetostriction.\n\nB. Both Sample C and Sample A will exhibit a constant, non-zero magnetostriction value that is independent of the rod's orientation.\n\nC. Sample C will exhibit a constant magnetostriction independent of its orientation, while Sample A will show magnetostriction values that vary significantly with orientation.\n\nD. Sample C will exhibit magnetostriction values that vary significantly depending on its orientation, while Sample A will show a nearly constant magnetostriction value, largely independent of its orientation.\n\nE. Both samples will exhibit magnetostriction values that vary significantly with orientation, but the average value for Sample C will be larger than for Sample A.", "solution": "Define the measured magnetostriction as the longitudinal strain along the rod axis under saturation magnetization along that axis, namely $\\lambda=\\Delta L/L$.\n\nFor a single crystal (Sample C), the magnetostrictive strain depends on the direction of magnetization relative to the crystal axes due to magnetocrystalline anisotropy. For a cubic crystal, the axial strain measured along a unit vector $\\hat{n}$ when the magnetization is along a unit vector $\\hat{m}$ is given by\n$$\n\\epsilon_{\\ell}=\\frac{3}{2}\\lambda_{100}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\alpha_{i}^{2}\\beta_{i}^{2}-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)+3\\lambda_{111}\\left(\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\beta_{1}\\beta_{2}+\\alpha_{2}\\alpha_{3}\\beta_{2}\\beta_{3}+\\alpha_{3}\\alpha_{1}\\beta_{3}\\beta_{1}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha_{i}$ and $\\beta_{i}$ are the direction cosines of $\\hat{m}$ and $\\hat{n}$ with respect to the crystallographic axes, and $\\lambda_{100},\\lambda_{111}$ are the crystal’s magnetostriction constants. Rotating the rod between measurements changes the orientation of the crystal axes relative to the applied field (which is reapplied along the rod axis), thereby changing the sets $\\{\\alpha_{i}\\}$ and $\\{\\beta_{i}\\}$ and thus the measured $\\lambda$. Therefore, Sample C will exhibit magnetostriction values that vary significantly with orientation.\n\nFor an amorphous metallic glass (Sample A), there is no long-range order and the material is macroscopically isotropic. The magnetoelastic response at saturation is characterized by a single scalar saturation magnetostriction $\\lambda_{s}$, with strain tensor\n$$\n\\epsilon_{ij}=\\frac{3}{2}\\lambda_{s}\\left(m_{i}m_{j}-\\frac{1}{3}\\delta_{ij}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $m_{i}$ are the components of the unit magnetization vector.

Thus, Sample A will show a nearly constant magnetostriction value, largely independent of orientation.\n\nComparing the two, Sample C varies strongly with orientation due to magnetocrystalline anisotropy, whereas Sample A remains nearly constant due to isotropy.
