This requires modeling the system as an equivalent electrical circuit.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the electrical properties of the piezoelectric slab. The slab, with conductive electrodes coated on its faces of area $A = L \\times W$ and separated by a thickness $t$, acts as a parallel-plate capacitor. The capacitance $C$ of this structure is given by the standard formula for a parallel-plate capacitor:\n$$\nC = \\frac{\\epsilon A}{t}\n$$\nHere, $\\epsilon$ is the absolute permittivity of the piezoelectric material. It is related to the relative permittivity $\\epsilon_r$ and the permittivity of free space $\\epsilon_0$ by $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0$. Substituting the area $A=LW$, the capacitance is:\n$$\nC = \\frac{\\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0 L W}{t}\n$$\nWhen the constant force $F$ is applied at $t=0$, the direct piezoelectric effect causes a charge $Q_p$ to be generated on the electrodes. The magnitude of this charge is proportional to the applied force, $Q_p = d_{33} F$. This charge is generated very quickly and can be considered to appear instantaneously at $t=0$.\n\nThis generated charge $Q_p$ accumulates on the \"plates\" of the capacitor formed by the piezoelectric slab, creating an initial voltage $V_0$ across it, where $V_0 = Q_p / C$.\n\nThe piezoelectric crystal (modeled as a capacitor $C$) is connected in parallel with an external resistor $R$. The charge $Q_p$ that was generated by the force now has a path to flow from one electrode to the other through the resistor. This setup forms a simple Resistor-Capacitor (RC) circuit. The charge on the capacitor will discharge through the resistor, causing the voltage across both components (as they are in parallel) to decay over time.\n\nLet $V(t)$ be the voltage across the capacitor (and resistor) at time $t$. The current flowing through the resistor is given by Ohm's law, $I(t) = V(t)/R$. This current is supplied by the capacitor as it discharges. The current from a capacitor is related to the change in voltage across it by $I(t) = -C \\frac{dV(t)}{dt}$. The negative sign indicates that the charge on the capacitor is decreasing.\n\nEquating the two expressions for the current, we get the governing differential equation for the circuit:\n$$\n\\frac{V(t)}{R} = -C \\frac{dV(t)}{dt}\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{V} = -\\frac{1}{RC} dt\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation.
