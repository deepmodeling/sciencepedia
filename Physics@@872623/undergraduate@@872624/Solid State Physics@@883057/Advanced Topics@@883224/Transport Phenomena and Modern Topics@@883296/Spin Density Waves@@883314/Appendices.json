[@problem_id:1198911]", "problem": "A spin density wave (SDW) is a state of matter in which the spin density forms a periodic pattern. In many materials, particularly those with quasi-two-dimensional electronic structures, the onset of an SDW is driven by a nesting instability of the Fermi surface. Consider a two-dimensional tight-binding model for electrons on a square lattice with lattice constant $a=1$. The energy dispersion relation $\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k})$ includes hopping to nearest-neighbor sites (amplitude $t$) and next-nearest-neighbor sites (amplitude $t'$). The dispersion is given by:\n$$ \\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}) = -2t (\\cos k_x + \\cos k_y) - 4t' \\cos k_x \\cos k_y $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{k}=(k_x, k_y)$ is the wavevector in the first Brillouin zone, $[-\\pi, \\pi] \\times [-\\pi, \\pi]$. We assume $t>0$ and $t' \\ge 0$.\n\nAt half-filling, for $t'=0$, the Fermi surface is perfectly nested by the wavevector $\\mathbf{Q}=(\\pi, \\pi)$, meaning $\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}) = -\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k})$. This leads to a strong tendency to form an SDW with this wavevector. When $t' > 0$, this perfect nesting condition is broken. However, for small $t'/t$, the optimal nesting vector (which maximizes the spin susceptibility) remains $\\mathbf{Q}=(\\pi, \\pi)$.\n\nAs the ratio $t'/t$ increases, the band structure deforms, and beyond a certain critical value, the optimal nesting vector deviates from $(\\pi, \\pi)$ to an incommensurate value. This change is driven by a qualitative change in the band structure's global features.
