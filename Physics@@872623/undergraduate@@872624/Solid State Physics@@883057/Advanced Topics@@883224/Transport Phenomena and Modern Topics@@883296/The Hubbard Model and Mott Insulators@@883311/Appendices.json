The first step is to identify all possible microstates of the system and then construct the Hamiltonian matrix in the basis of these states.\n\n**Step 1: Define the basis states**\nLet the two sites be labeled 1 and 2. Each site can be empty (0), occupied by a spin-up electron ($\\uparrow$), or a spin-down electron ($\\downarrow$). For two electrons, we must place them in the four available spin-orbitals (site 1-up, site 1-down, site 2-up, site 2-down).

However, site 2 is already occupied by an electron with the same spin ($\\uparrow$). Due to the Pauli exclusion principle, this hop is forbidden ($c_{2\\uparrow}^{\\dagger}c_{1\\uparrow}|\\uparrow_1, \\uparrow_2\\rangle = 0$).
