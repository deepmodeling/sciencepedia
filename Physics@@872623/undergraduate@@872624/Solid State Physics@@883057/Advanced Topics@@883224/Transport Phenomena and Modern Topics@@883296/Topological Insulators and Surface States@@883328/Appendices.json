The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model provides a beautiful and intuitive entry point into the world of topological insulators. This first practice invites you to explore how the fundamental structure of this chain—specifically, how it terminates at its ends—dictates the presence or absence of special, localized electronic states, introducing the core principle of bulk-boundary correspondence. [@problem_id:1825405]", "problem": "A one-dimensional toy model for a polymer is constructed from a finite chain of $N$ identical atoms, where $N$ is an even integer. Electrons can hop between adjacent atomic sites. The structure is dimerized, meaning the hopping integral $t$ between adjacent sites alternates between a strong value, $v$, and a weak value, $w$, with $v > w > 0$. We consider two possible ways to terminate the finite chain:\n\n*   **Configuration A**: The sequence of hopping integrals, starting from the bond between site 1 and site 2, is $v, w, v, w, \\dots, v$. The first bond (between sites 1 and 2) and the last bond (between sites $N-1$ and $N$) are both strong.\n*   **Configuration B**: The sequence of hopping integrals, starting from the bond between site 1 and site 2, is $w, v, w, v, \\dots, w$. The first bond (between sites 1 and 2) and the last bond (between sites $N-1$ and $N$) are both weak.\n\nOne of these configurations is a simple model of a one-dimensional topological insulator, which supports special electronic states called edge states. These states have an energy of exactly zero (relative to the mid-gap) and their wavefunctions are localized at the two ends of the chain.\n\nWhich of the configurations supports such zero-energy edge states, and what is the key physical intuition behind their existence?\n\nA. Configuration B supports edge states. This is because the chain can be thought of as a series of strongly-bonded dimers, with weakly-bonded \"unpaired\" atoms left at each end.\n\nB. Configuration A supports edge states. This is because the strong bonds at the ends provide the necessary condition to confine a state at the boundary.\n\nC. Both configurations support edge states. Any abrupt termination of a periodic potential, regardless of the final bond strength, will create mid-gap states.\n\nD. Neither configuration supports edge states. A finite system of atoms always results in discrete energy levels, none of which can be guaranteed to be exactly at zero energy.\n\nE. The existence of edge states depends on whether $N/2$ is even or odd, not on the termination configuration.", "solution": "Model the chain with a nearest-neighbor tight-binding Hamiltonian on sites labeled by integers $n=1,\\dots,N$:\n$$\nH=\\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} t_{n} \\left( |n\\rangle\\langle n+1|+|n+1\\rangle\\langle n| \\right),\n$$\nwith dimerized hoppings $t_{n}\\in\\{v,w\\}$, $v>w>0$, alternating along the chain.

By the same reasoning, enforcing the right boundary condition $t_{N-1}\\psi_{N-1}=0$ yields a second zero-energy solution localized at the right edge, supported on the even sublattice and decaying leftward with the same ratio $w/v$. In a long but finite chain these two edge-localized solutions weakly overlap; their hybridization produces an exponentially small splitting symmetric about zero due to chiral symmetry. In the idealized topological-insulator picture (or in the semi-infinite limit), they are pinned at $E=0$.\n\nNow contrast with Configuration A, where $t_{1}=v$, $t_{2}=w$, $t_{3}=v$, \\dots, $t_{N-1}=v$.

Hence any putative left-edge zero-energy solution is non-normalizable (and cannot satisfy the right boundary simultaneously), and similarly no right-edge zero-energy solution exists. Therefore Configuration A does not support zero-energy edge states.\n\nThe key physical intuition is the dimer picture: when $v>w$, the system tends to form strongly bonded dimers across the $v$ links. In Configuration B, the chain terminates with weak bonds at both ends, leaving one atom at each end not strongly paired into a dimer. Each such effectively \"unpaired\" boundary site hosts a state whose amplitude decays into the bulk by the factor $w/v$ per unit cell, giving an edge-localized mid-gap state protected by chiral symmetry and the nontrivial bulk winding. In Configuration A, the ends are strongly bonded into dimers, leaving no unpaired boundary sites and thus no edge states.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1825405"}, {"introduction": "After seeing that topological insulators can host conducting states at their boundaries, it's crucial to solidify our understanding of their bulk properties. This exercise presents a conceptual challenge based on a hypothetical experiment. By considering only a measurement of bulk conductivity, you are asked to determine if a material can be definitively classified, forcing a clear distinction between a topological insulator and a conventional band insulator.

Yes, the material can be definitively classified as a conventional band insulator because zero conductivity is the defining feature of any insulator at absolute zero.\n\nB. Yes, the material can be definitively classified as a topological insulator because the fact that the bulk is insulating is the most important characteristic of this phase.\n\nC. No, the material cannot be definitively classified because this measurement does not distinguish between a conventional band insulator and a semiconductor, which would also have zero conductivity at $T=0$.\n\nD. No, the material cannot be definitively classified because both conventional band insulators and topological insulators have an insulating bulk with zero conductivity at $T=0$. This measurement provides no information about the presence or absence of special surface states.\n\nE.

Therefore, based solely on zero bulk conductivity at $T=0$, one cannot decide between a conventional band insulator and a topological insulator.\n\nEvaluating the options: A is incorrect because zero bulk conductivity at $T=0$ is not unique to conventional band insulators; it also holds for topological insulators and other gapped phases. B is incorrect because the bulk being insulating is necessary but not sufficient to establish a topological insulator; one needs evidence of protected surface conduction or a topological invariant. C is not the appropriate criterion here and is not generally valid as stated, since doped semiconductors can have finite conductivity at $T=0$, and the problem’s classification is between a conventional band insulator and a topological insulator; moreover, even if intrinsic semiconductors have $\\sigma_{\\text{bulk}}(0)=0$, this does not address the TI distinction.
