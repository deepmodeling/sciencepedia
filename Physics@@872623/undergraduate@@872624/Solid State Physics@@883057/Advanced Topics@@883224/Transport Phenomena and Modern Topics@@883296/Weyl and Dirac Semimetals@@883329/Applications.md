## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the fundamental principles governing Dirac and Weyl semimetals, focusing on their unique band structures, topological invariants, and the nature of their low-energy quasiparticles. Having built this theoretical foundation, we now turn our attention to the practical manifestations and broader scientific importance of these materials. The abstract concepts of chiral fermions, Berry curvature, and [topological protection](@entry_id:145388) translate into a host of unique, experimentally observable phenomena. This chapter will explore these applications, demonstrating how Dirac and Weyl semimetals serve not only as candidates for next-generation electronic and spintronic devices but also as remarkable tabletop laboratories for testing ideas from [high-energy physics](@entry_id:181260) and cosmology.

### Experimental Signatures and Material Realizations

The theoretical prediction of [topological semimetals](@entry_id:137800) has been followed by intense experimental efforts to discover and characterize them. These efforts rely on sophisticated techniques that can probe the electronic structure of materials with high resolution. Among the most pivotal of these is Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES), a powerful method that directly maps the energy-momentum dispersion of electrons in a crystal.

For Weyl [semimetals](@entry_id:152277), the most sought-after ARPES signature is the **Fermi arc**. As dictated by the bulk-boundary correspondence, the non-[trivial topology](@entry_id:154009) of the bulk Weyl nodes necessitates the existence of unique, topologically protected states on the material's surface. At a constant energy, these [surface states](@entry_id:137922) form an unclosed line segment in the surface Brillouin zone. This segment, the Fermi arc, is a truly exotic electronic state: it is an open-ended Fermi "surface" that originates and terminates at the surface projections of two bulk Weyl nodes of opposite chirality. This stands in stark contrast to conventional metals, where all Fermi surfaces must form closed loops. The direct observation of such a disconnected arc in an ARPES experiment is considered definitive proof of a Weyl semimetal phase [@problem_id:1827872]. Indeed, the first experimental confirmations of Weyl [semimetals](@entry_id:152277), such as in the tantalum arsenide (TaAs) family of compounds, were based on the landmark ARPES visualization of these predicted Fermi arcs [@problem_id:1827864].

While ARPES provides a direct view of the [band structure](@entry_id:139379), transport measurements offer a complementary and powerful way to probe the consequences of this unique electronic structure. Quantum oscillation phenomena, such as the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) effect (oscillations in [magnetoresistance](@entry_id:265774)) and the de Haas-van Alphen effect (oscillations in magnetization), are standard tools for mapping the Fermi surface of metals. In these experiments, the resistance or magnetization oscillates periodically in the inverse of the applied magnetic field, $1/B$. The frequency of these oscillations is directly proportional to the extremal cross-sectional area of the Fermi surface perpendicular to the field. By measuring these oscillations for different magnetic field orientations, one can reconstruct the size, shape, and dimensionality of the Fermi surface. For a Dirac semimetal like cadmium arsenide (Cd$_3$As$_2$), which is often described as a 3D analogue of graphene due to its linear dispersion, SdH measurements can be used to determine the Fermi wavevector and confirm the existence of small, point-like or nearly spherical Fermi surfaces surrounding the bulk Dirac points [@problem_id:1827869] [@problem_id:1827864].

### Unique Physical Properties and Transport Phenomena

The linear dispersion and non-[trivial topology](@entry_id:154009) of Weyl and Dirac [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) give rise to physical properties that are qualitatively different from those of conventional materials.

A fundamental [thermodynamic signature](@entry_id:185212) is the [electronic specific heat](@entry_id:144099), $C_V$. For ordinary metals, the density of states (DOS) is approximately constant at the Fermi level, leading to a [specific heat](@entry_id:136923) that is linear in temperature ($C_V \propto T$) at low temperatures. In contrast, for an ideal, undoped Dirac or Weyl semimetal, the Fermi level lies exactly at the nodal point where the DOS vanishes. The linear dispersion in three dimensions results in a DOS that grows quadratically with energy away from the node ($D(E) \propto E^2$). This distinct energy dependence of the DOS leads to a completely different low-temperature scaling for the [electronic specific heat](@entry_id:144099), which is found to be proportional to $T^3$. This $T^3$ behavior, identical in its temperature dependence to the contribution from [lattice vibrations](@entry_id:145169) (phonons), is a direct thermodynamic consequence of the massless, relativistic nature of the charge carriers [@problem_id:1827856].

The [optical response](@entry_id:138303) of these materials is similarly distinctive. The [optical conductivity](@entry_id:139437), $\sigma_1(\omega)$, which measures the absorption of light at frequency $\omega$, is directly related to the [joint density of states](@entry_id:143002) for transitions between the valence and conduction bands. For a Weyl or Dirac semimetal with its 3D linear dispersion, a straightforward calculation shows that the interband [optical conductivity](@entry_id:139437) scales linearly with frequency, $\sigma_1(\omega) \propto \omega$. This linear dependence is a robust signature of the conical band structure and serves as another experimental fingerprint to distinguish these materials from conventional semiconductors (which have an [absorption edge](@entry_id:274704)) or metals (with a more [complex frequency](@entry_id:266400) dependence) [@problem_id:1827851].

Perhaps the most celebrated transport phenomenon in Weyl semimetals is the **[chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077)**, a fundamental quantum mechanical effect that manifests as a macroscopic electrical response. The [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077) refers to the non-conservation of the number of particles of a single [chirality](@entry_id:144105) (e.g., right-handed or left-handed) in the presence of parallel electric ($\mathbf{E}$) and magnetic ($\mathbf{B}$) fields. In this configuration, a "pumping" mechanism transfers electrons between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality at a rate proportional to the product $\mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{B}$. While the total number of electrons is conserved, the numbers of left- and right-handed carriers, $N_L$ and $N_R$, are not individually conserved [@problem_id:1827855].

This chiral pumping, balanced in a steady state by [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) processes, creates a population imbalance and a separation of the chemical potentials for the two chiralities. This imbalance, in turn, drives an anomalous current parallel to the applied fields via a related phenomenon known as the [chiral magnetic effect](@entry_id:143193). The net result is an additional contribution to the electrical conductivity that increases with the strength of the magnetic field. This leads to the remarkable observation of a **[negative longitudinal magnetoresistance](@entry_id:146729)**, where the material's resistance *decreases* as the parallel magnetic field increases—the opposite of the behavior in nearly all conventional metals. The observation of this distinctive [negative magnetoresistance](@entry_id:136874), strongly peaked along the direction of the magnetic field, has become a key transport signature for identifying candidate Weyl semimetals [@problem_id:1827825].

The influence of Berry curvature extends beyond purely electrical transport to thermoelectric phenomena. The anomalous Nernst effect, for instance, describes the generation of a transverse electric voltage in response to a longitudinal temperature gradient. In Weyl [semimetals](@entry_id:152277), the intrinsic Berry curvature of the [electronic bands](@entry_id:175335) can give rise to such a response even in the absence of an external magnetic field. The size of this anomalous Nernst coefficient can be related to the [energy derivative](@entry_id:268961) of the anomalous Hall conductivity via the Mott relation, providing a direct link between topological band properties and the material's thermoelectric response [@problem_id:1827845].

### Engineering Topological States

The intimate relationship between symmetry and topology in these materials provides a powerful toolkit for designing and controlling their electronic properties. Dirac points in three dimensions are typically accidental degeneracies that require protection by crystal symmetries—most commonly, the combined presence of [time-reversal symmetry](@entry_id:138094) ($T$) and spatial [inversion symmetry](@entry_id:269948) ($P$). Breaking either of these symmetries can lift the four-fold degeneracy of the Dirac point.

If [inversion symmetry](@entry_id:269948) is broken, for instance by applying a uniaxial strain to the crystal, the Dirac point is generically unstable. It will split into a pair of two-fold degenerate Weyl points, separated from each other in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936). The material is thus driven from a Dirac semimetal into a Weyl semimetal phase [@problem_id:1827839]. Similarly, applying an external magnetic field explicitly breaks [time-reversal symmetry](@entry_id:138094). This perturbation also lifts the degeneracy of the Dirac point, splitting it into a pair of Weyl points and inducing a Dirac-to-Weyl semimetal transition [@problem_id:1827854]. This tunability offers a dynamic way to control the topological state of the material.

Beyond perturbing existing materials, it is also possible to engineer these topological states from the ground up using [heterostructures](@entry_id:136451). For example, one can theoretically construct a 3D Dirac semimetal by stacking 2D layers of a conventional gapped material. Consider a system of 2D layers, each with an energy gap $\Delta$. If these layers are brought together, interlayer coupling ($t_z$) introduces a momentum dependence along the stacking direction ($k_z$). If the coupling is sufficiently strong ($t_z > \Delta$), the overall band gap of the 3D system can close at specific values of $k_z$. The points of this gap closure are precisely the 3D Dirac points, emerging from a phase transition driven by the competition between the 2D gap and the 3D interlayer hopping [@problem_id:1827834]. This bottom-up approach provides a versatile design principle for creating novel topological materials.

### Interdisciplinary Connections and Advanced Phenomena

The significance of Weyl and Dirac semimetals extends far beyond condensed matter physics. Because their low-energy quasiparticles are direct solid-state realizations of the massless chiral fermions of relativistic quantum field theory, these materials function as accessible experimental platforms for exploring phenomena once thought to be the exclusive domain of high-energy physics.

One of the most striking examples is **Klein tunneling**. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, a particle has an exponentially small probability of tunneling through a [potential barrier](@entry_id:147595) that is higher than its kinetic energy. In contrast, for massless relativistic particles like Weyl fermions, theory predicts that they can transmit through an arbitrarily high [potential barrier](@entry_id:147595) with perfect probability (transmission $T=1$) for [normal incidence](@entry_id:260681). This counter-intuitive effect, a direct consequence of the particle's [chirality](@entry_id:144105), can be studied in Weyl and Dirac semimetals by creating potential steps using electrostatic gates. The observation of near-perfect transmission would be a direct confirmation of the relativistic nature of the material's quasiparticles [@problem_id:1827859].

The interplay with other collective quantum states, like superconductivity, also leads to new physics. When a Dirac or Weyl semimetal is used as the weak link in a **Josephson junction** between two [conventional superconductors](@entry_id:275247), its unique electronic properties directly influence the supercurrent. The number of conducting channels contributing to the supercurrent is determined by the semimetal's [density of states](@entry_id:147894), and the perfect transmission associated with Klein tunneling can lead to an unusual current-phase relationship. Such hybrid devices are a fertile ground for exploring [topological superconductivity](@entry_id:141300) and developing novel quantum technologies [@problem_id:1122816].

Furthermore, the collective "fluid" of Weyl fermions can exhibit hydrodynamic phenomena with analogues in astrophysics and [quark-gluon plasma](@entry_id:137501) physics. The **chiral vortical effect** predicts that a rotating fluid of chiral fermions will generate an equilibrium particle current proportional to the system's vorticity ($\boldsymbol{\omega} = 2\boldsymbol{\Omega}$, for angular velocity $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$). In a Weyl semimetal, this means that simply rotating the crystal can induce an [electric current](@entry_id:261145). This effect, arising from the interplay of [quantum statistics](@entry_id:143815) and [general covariance](@entry_id:159290), connects the electronic transport in a solid to the physics of rotating [neutron stars](@entry_id:139683) and the primordial [quark-gluon plasma](@entry_id:137501) of the early universe [@problem_id:1122833].

Finally, the electromagnetic response in some topological materials is described by a modified set of Maxwell's equations that includes a so-called axion term, $\mathcal{L}_{\theta} \propto \theta \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{B}$. This term mixes the electric and magnetic fields and has profound consequences. One famous prediction of this "[axion electrodynamics](@entry_id:144423)" is the Witten effect: a [magnetic monopole](@entry_id:149129) placed inside such a medium would induce an electric charge proportional to the [axion angle](@entry_id:139420) $\theta$. While fundamental [magnetic monopoles](@entry_id:142817) remain hypothetical, Weyl and Dirac [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) provide a condensed matter realization of this physics, where [emergent magnetic monopoles](@entry_id:140370) (the Weyl nodes themselves) and other [topological defects](@entry_id:138787) could exhibit this exotic charge-induction phenomenon [@problem_id:1239167]. This connection places the study of [topological semimetals](@entry_id:137800) at the crossroads of [condensed matter](@entry_id:747660), particle physics, and cosmology, promising a continuing source of fundamental discoveries and innovative applications.
