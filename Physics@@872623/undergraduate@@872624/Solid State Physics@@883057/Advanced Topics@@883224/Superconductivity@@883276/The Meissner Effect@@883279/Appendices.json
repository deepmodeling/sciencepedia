We can model this macroscopic response by treating the superconductor as an object that generates its own magnetic field to precisely cancel the applied one. This first exercise guides you through calculating the induced magnetic dipole moment of a superconducting sphere, a foundational model for understanding its interaction with magnetic fields [@problem_id:1819121].", "problem": "A sphere of radius $R$ made of a Type-I superconducting material is cooled below its critical temperature. It is then placed in a region of space with a previously uniform, weak external magnetic field, which is described by the vector $\\vec{B}_{\\text{ext}} = B_0 \\hat{z}$. In response to this external field, the superconductor develops surface currents that perfectly expel the magnetic field from its interior, a phenomenon known as the Meissner effect. These surface currents, in turn, generate their own magnetic field. This induced field, outside the sphere, is equivalent to that of an idealized magnetic dipole located at the center of the sphere. Determine the vector expression for this induced magnetic dipole moment, $\\vec{m}$, in terms of the given parameters $R$, $B_0$, and the permeability of free space, $\\mu_0$.", "solution": "We work in magnetostatics with no free currents in the vacuum region outside the sphere.

This critical question lies at the heart of understanding the Meissner effect as a distinct thermodynamic phase, rather than just an electrodynamic consequence. This practice explores a thought experiment comparing Field-Cooled (FC) and Zero-Field-Cooled (ZFC) procedures to reveal the fundamental difference between flux trapping in a perfect conductor and active field expulsion in a superconductor [@problem_id:1819147].", "problem": "To investigate the magnetic properties of a newly synthesized material, a small sphere of radius $R$ is subjected to two distinct experimental procedures. The material is known to undergo a phase transition at a critical temperature $T_c$. Above $T_c$, it is non-magnetic. Below $T_c$, its behavior is to be determined.\n\nThe sphere is centered at the origin and placed in a uniform external magnetic field, $\\vec{B}_{ext}$, of magnitude $B_0$, oriented along the z-axis. A magnetometer measures the magnitude of the magnetic field component parallel to the z-axis at a point on the z-axis at a distance $d$ from the origin, where $dR$.\n\nTwo procedures are conducted:\n1.  **Field-Cooled (FC):** The material, initially at a temperature $T  T_c$, is placed in the external field $B_0$. It is then cooled in the constant presence of this field to a final temperature $T_{low}  T_c$. The magnetic field, $B_{FC}$, is measured at this final state.\n2.  **Zero-Field-Cooled (ZFC):** The material is first cooled in the complete absence of any external field to the same temperature $T_{low}  T_c$. The external field $B_0$ is then applied. The magnetic field, $B_{ZFC}$, is measured.\n\nA key distinction in condensed matter physics is between a \"perfect conductor\" and a \"superconductor\". A perfect conductor is a hypothetical material with zero electrical resistance, which implies that the magnetic flux through it can never change. In contrast, a true superconductor not only behaves as a perfect conductor but also actively expels any pre-existing magnetic field when cooled below $T_c$, a phenomenon known as the Meissner effect.\n\nCalculate the theoretical ratio $\\gamma = \\frac{B_{FC}}{B_{ZFC}}$ that would be measured if the material were a perfect conductor but *not* a superconductor (i.e., it does not exhibit the Meissner effect). Express your answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $R$ and $d$.", "solution": "We model the material below the critical temperature as a perfect conductor without the Meissner effect. The key electrodynamic principle is Faraday’s law in quasistatics, which implies flux freezing in a perfect conductor: once the material becomes perfectly conducting, the magnetic flux through any material loop is time-invariant.\n\nField-cooled (FC): Initially at $TT_{c}$ with the uniform external field $\\vec{B}_{ext}=B_{0}\\hat{z}$, the material is non-magnetic, so it does not disturb the field and the field inside the sphere is uniformly $B_{0}\\hat{z}$. Upon cooling through $T_{c}$ into the perfect-conductor state, this internal field is frozen. Since the internal field equals the external uniform field, no surface currents are required and the field everywhere remains the undisturbed uniform field. Therefore, at the observation point on the $z$ axis at $z=dR$, the measured field is\n$$\nB_{FC}=B_{0}.\n$$\n\nZero-field-cooled (ZFC): The material is cooled to $T_{low}T_{c}$ in zero field, so the internal magnetic field is zero and is then frozen. When the external uniform field $\\vec{B}_{ext}=B_{0}\\hat{z}$ is subsequently applied, the perfect conductor must prevent any change of magnetic flux inside; this enforces $B_{in}=0$.
