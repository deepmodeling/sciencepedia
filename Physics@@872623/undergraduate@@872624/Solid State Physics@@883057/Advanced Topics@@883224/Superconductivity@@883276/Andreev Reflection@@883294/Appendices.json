This first exercise invites you to apply the principle of energy conservation to a single reflection event at a normal-superconductor interface. By tracking the energy of the incident electron and the resulting Cooper pair, you can deduce the energy of the reflected hole, a key feature that distinguishes this process from ordinary reflection.

The energy $\\epsilon$ is positive and represents the electron's energy measured relative to the Fermi level.\n\nAt the interface, the electron undergoes a process known as Andreev reflection. This occurs because single-particle states are forbidden within the superconductor's energy gap. The process involves the incident electron from the normal metal pairing with a second electron, also from the normal metal, to form a Cooper pair. This Cooper pair, being the fundamental charge carrier of the superconducting state, enters the superconductor's condensate, which resides precisely at the Fermi energy $E_F$. The creation of the pair leaves behind an empty state in the normal metal, which propagates away from the interface as a reflected hole.\n\nBased on this description, determine the energy of the reflected hole.

This problem delves into the energy-dependent probability of Andreev reflection in this regime, where the electron can either reflect as a hole or be transmitted as a quasiparticle.
