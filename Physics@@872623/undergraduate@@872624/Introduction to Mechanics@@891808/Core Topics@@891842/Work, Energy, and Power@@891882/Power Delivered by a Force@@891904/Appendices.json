This means power depends not only on the magnitudes of the force and velocity but critically on the angle between them. This exercise uses the familiar scenario of projectile motion to explore a special case: when the force and velocity vectors are perpendicular.

While the force of static friction is essential for a wheel to roll without slipping, does it actually deliver power to the wheel? This problem requires you to carefully consider the definition of power in the context of rotational motion. By analyzing the velocity at the exact point where the friction force is applied, you will uncover a crucial and somewhat counterintuitive principle about work and power in rolling systems.
