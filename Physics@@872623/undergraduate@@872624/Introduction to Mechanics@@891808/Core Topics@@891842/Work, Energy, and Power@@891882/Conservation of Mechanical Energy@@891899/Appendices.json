We will track the energy of a block as it transforms from gravitational potential energy at the top of an incline to kinetic energy at the bottom, and finally into elastic potential energy stored in a spring. Solving this problem [@problem_id:2185030] provides fundamental practice in applying the principle of conservation of mechanical energy to a purely conservative system.", "problem": "A small block of mass $m$ is initially at rest at the top of a smooth, frictionless incline. The incline makes an angle $\\theta$ with the horizontal, and the initial vertical height of the block above the base of the incline is $h$. The incline merges seamlessly with a frictionless horizontal track. A light, horizontal spring with a spring constant $k$ is fixed to a rigid wall at one end. The other end of the spring is free and is located at the point where the incline meets the horizontal track. Let this point define the origin of a coordinate system, $x=0$. The block slides down the incline, moves along the horizontal track, and collides with the free end of the spring. The collision is instantaneous, and the block becomes permanently attached to the spring. Subsequently, the block-spring system undergoes simple harmonic motion.\n\nDerive an expression for the amplitude of this simple harmonic motion in terms of $m$, $g$, $h$, and $k$. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$.", "solution": "The block starts from rest at vertical height $h$ above the base, so its initial mechanical energy is purely gravitational potential:\n$$\nE_{\\text{top}}=m g h.\n$$\nThe incline and track are frictionless, so mechanical energy is conserved during the slide. Just before contacting the spring at $x=0$ on the horizontal track, the block’s kinetic energy equals the lost potential energy:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} m v_{0}^{2}=m g h \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_{0}=\\sqrt{2 g h}.\n$$\nAt the instant of attachment to the massless horizontal spring (taken as $t=0$), the block is at $x(0)=0$ and has velocity $v(0)=v_{0}$. The horizontal equilibrium position of the mass-spring system is $x=0$ (no gravitational component along the horizontal), and the subsequent motion is simple harmonic with angular frequency\n$$\n\\omega=\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}.\n$$\nFor simple harmonic motion, the total mechanical energy can be written either as $E=\\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}+\\frac{1}{2} k x^{2}$ at any time or as $E=\\frac{1}{2} k A^{2}$ in terms of the amplitude $A$.

The device consists of a large base ball with mass $M$ and a small projectile ball with mass $m$. The projectile is placed directly on top of the base, such that their centers are vertically aligned.
