This practice moves beyond the idealized Hooke's Law for springs to explore a more realistic scenario where a material's stiffness changes as it's stretched. By calculating the work done on a non-linear polymer filament, you will apply integral calculus to a practical problem in materials science, deepening your understanding of how energy is stored in deformable objects [@problem_id:2231092].", "problem": "In a materials science laboratory, a team is investigating the properties of a novel non-linear polymer filament. When this filament is stretched, it behaves like a spring, but its stiffness weakens as the extension increases.
