The block's motion is opposed by a frictional force from the surface. In many introductory physics problems, the coefficient of kinetic friction is treated as a constant. However, for certain material interfaces and lubrication regimes, this coefficient can be speed-dependent. For this particular system, the coefficient of kinetic friction $\\mu_k$ is accurately described by the model $\\mu_k(v) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{1 + v/v_c}$, where $v$ is the instantaneous speed of the block, and $\\mu_0$ and $v_c$ are positive constants representing the static friction coefficient analogue and a characteristic speed, respectively.\n\nAssuming the acceleration due to gravity is $g$, derive an expression for the instantaneous power being dissipated by the frictional force as a function of the block's speed $v$. Your final expression should be in terms of $m, g, \\mu_0, v_c$, and $v$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the instantaneous power dissipated by the frictional force as a function of the block's speed $v$.\n\nFirst, we recall the definition of instantaneous power $P$ delivered by a force $\\vec{F}$ to an object moving with velocity $\\vec{v}$:\n$$P = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{v}$$\nIn this case, the force is the kinetic friction force, $\\vec{F}_{fr}$. The frictional force always opposes the direction of motion. Therefore, the vector $\\vec{F}_{fr}$ is anti-parallel to the velocity vector $\\vec{v}$. The angle between them is $\\theta = 180^{\\circ}$ or $\\pi$ radians. The dot product can then be written as:\n$$P_{fr} = |\\vec{F}_{fr}| |\\vec{v}| \\cos(\\pi) = -F_{fr} v$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the frictional force removes energy from the block. The question asks for the power *dissipated* by friction, which is the rate at which energy is lost from the system. This is a positive quantity, equal to the magnitude of the power calculated above.\n$$P_{dissipated} = |P_{fr}| = F_{fr} v$$\n\nNext, we need to find the magnitude of the frictional force, $F_{fr}$. The formula for kinetic friction is:\n$$F_{fr} = \\mu_k N$$\nwhere $\\mu_k$ is the coefficient of kinetic friction and $N$ is the magnitude of the normal force exerted by the surface on the block.\n\nTo find the normal force $N$, we analyze the vertical forces acting on the block. The block is on a horizontal surface and is not accelerating in the vertical direction. The two vertical forces are the gravitational force, $F_g = mg$, acting downwards, and the normal force, $N$, acting upwards. According to Newton's first law in the vertical direction:\n$$\\sum F_y = N - mg = 0$$\nThus, the magnitude of the normal force is equal to the magnitude of the gravitational force:\n$$N = mg$$\n\nNow we can write an expression for the frictional force by substituting the expression for $N$ and the given speed-dependent coefficient of kinetic friction, $\\mu_k(v) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{1 + v/v_c}$.\n$$F_{fr}(v) = \\mu_k(v) N = \\left( \\frac{\\mu_0}{1 + v/v_c} \\right) (mg)$$\n$$F_{fr}(v) = \\frac{\\mu_0 m g}{1 + v/v_c}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute this expression for the frictional force into our equation for the dissipated power:\n$$P_{dissipated}(v) = F_{fr}(v) \\cdot v$$\n$$P_{dissipated}(v) = \\left( \\frac{\\mu_0 m g}{1 + v/v_c} \\right) v$$\n$$P_{dissipated}(v) = \\frac{\\mu_0 m g v}{1 + v/v_c}$$\n\nTo make the expression look cleaner, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $v_c$:\n$$P_{dissipated}(v) = \\frac{\\mu_0 m g v}{1 + v/v_c} \\cdot \\frac{v_c}{v_c} = \\frac{\\mu_0 m g v v_c}{v_c(1 + v/v_c)} = \\frac{\\mu_0 m g v v_c}{v_c + v}$$\n\nThis is the final expression for the instantaneous power dissipated by friction as a function of the block's speed $v$.

By definition, this is $P_N = \\vec{N} \\cdot \\vec{v}_p$, where $\\vec{v}_p$ is the velocity of the particle in the laboratory frame.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the motion and forces. A key insight is to decompose the particle's velocity. The particle is moving on a surface which is itself translating. Let $\\vec{r}_C(t)$ be the position of the center of the hemisphere in the lab frame, and $\\vec{r}_{rel}(t)$ be the position of the particle relative to this center. The particle's absolute position is $\\vec{r}_p(t) = \\vec{r}_C(t) + \\vec{r}_{rel}(t)$. The velocity is then $\\vec{v}_p(t) = \\frac{d\\vec{r}_C}{dt} + \\frac{d\\vec{r}_{rel}}{dt} = \\vec{v}_C(t) + \\vec{v}_{rel}(t)$.\n\nThe normal force $\\vec{N}$ is always perpendicular to the surface of the hemisphere. Since the particle's velocity relative to the center, $\\vec{v}_{rel}$, is always tangent to this surface, we have $\\vec{N} \\cdot \\vec{v}_{rel} = 0$.\nThe power can thus be simplified:\n$$\nP_N = \\vec{N} \\cdot (\\vec{v}_C + \\vec{v}_{rel}) = \\vec{N} \\cdot \\vec{v}_C + \\vec{N} \\cdot \\vec{v}_{rel} = \\vec{N} \\cdot \\vec{v}_C\n$$\nThe bottom of the bowl is accelerating with $\\vec{a}_B(t) = \\alpha t \\hat{i}$. The center of the hemisphere is located at a constant height $R$ above the bottom. Let the bottom of the bowl be at position $x_B(t) \\hat{i}$. Then the center is at $\\vec{r}_C(t) = x_B(t) \\hat{i} + R \\hat{k}$. The velocity of the center is $\\vec{v}_C(t) = \\dot{x}_B(t) \\hat{i}$.\nSince the bowl starts from rest, we can find its velocity by integrating the acceleration:\n$$\n\\dot{x}_B(t) = \\int_0^t a_B(\\tau) d\\tau = \\int_0^t \\alpha \\tau d\\tau = \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha t^2\n$$\nSo, $\\vec{v}_C(t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha t^2 \\hat{i}$. The power is now $P_N = \\vec{N} \\cdot (\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha t^2 \\hat{i})$. To find this, we need the normal force vector $\\vec{N}$.\n\nWe use the condition of quasi-static equilibrium in the bowl's co-moving, non-inertial frame. In this frame, the particle is stationary. The forces acting on it must sum to zero. These forces are the true forces (gravity $\\vec{F}_g$ and normal force $\\vec{N}$) and the fictitious force $\\vec{F}_{fict}$ due to the frame's acceleration.\n$$\n\\vec{N} + \\vec{F}_g + \\vec{F}_{fict} = \\vec{0}\n$$\nThe forces are given by:\n$\\vec{F}_g = -mg\\hat{k}$\n$\\vec{F}_{fict} = -m\\vec{a}_B(t) = -m(\\alpha t \\hat{i}) = -m\\alpha t \\hat{i}$\n\nFrom the force balance equation, we can solve for the normal force:\n$$\n\\vec{N} = -(\\vec{F}_g + \\vec{F}_{fict}) = -(-mg\\hat{k} - m\\alpha t \\hat{i}) = m\\alpha t \\hat{i} + mg\\hat{k}\n$$\nThis expression gives the vector components of the normal force at any time $t$. Now we can calculate the power.\n$$\nP_N = \\vec{N} \\cdot \\vec{v}_C = (m\\alpha t \\hat{i} + mg\\hat{k}) \\cdot (\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha t^2 \\hat{i})\n$$\nUsing the orthogonality of the unit vectors ($\\hat{i} \\cdot \\hat{i} = 1$, $\\hat{k} \\cdot \\hat{i} = 0$), we get:\n$$\nP_N(t) = (m\\alpha t) (\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha t^2) + (mg)(0) = \\frac{1}{2}m\\alpha^2 t^3\n$$\nThis result is independent of the bowl's radius $R$ and the acceleration due to gravity $g$.
