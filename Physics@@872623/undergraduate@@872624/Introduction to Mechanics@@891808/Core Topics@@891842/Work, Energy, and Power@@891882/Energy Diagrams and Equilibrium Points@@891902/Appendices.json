This problem introduces a \"bungee spring,\" a cord that only exerts a force when stretched beyond its natural length, which requires us to construct a piecewise potential energy function. By applying the fundamental principle that a stable equilibrium corresponds to the minimum of the total potential energy, this exercise is an excellent first step in using energy methods for systems where the force law is not described by a single, simple function. [@problem_id:2189540]", "problem": "An object of mass $m$ is suspended vertically from a fixed support by a special lightweight cord. This cord has a natural unstretched length of $L_0$. The cord functions as a \"bungee spring\": it remains slack and exerts no force if its length is less than or equal to $L_0$, but it behaves as an ideal spring with a spring constant $k$ when its length exceeds $L_0$. The object is released and allowed to settle into a stable equilibrium position. Let $g$ be the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nDetermine the stretch of the cord, defined as the extension beyond its natural length $L_0$, when the object is at its stable equilibrium position.", "solution": "Let the vertical downward direction be positive. Denote the total length of the cord when the object is at rest by $L$. The cord is slack and exerts no force if $L \\leq L_{0}$, and behaves as an ideal spring with tension $T = k(L - L_{0})$ if $L > L_{0}$. \n\nFor a static equilibrium, the net force on the mass must be zero. If $L \\leq L_{0}$, the cord exerts no force, so the only force is the weight $mg$ downward. This cannot yield equilibrium because there is no upward force to balance $mg$. Therefore, at equilibrium the cord must be stretched with $L > L_{0}$.\n\nIn the stretched regime, the spring tension acts upward with magnitude $k(L - L_{0})$. Taking downward as positive, the net force is\n$$\nF_{\\text{net}} = mg - k(L - L_{0}).\n$$\nStatic equilibrium requires $F_{\\text{net}} = 0$, hence\n$$\nmg - k(L - L_{0}) = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k(L - L_{0}) = mg.\n$$\nDefine the stretch (extension beyond the natural length) by $x \\equiv L - L_{0}$. Then the equilibrium condition gives\n$$\nk x = mg \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = \\frac{m g}{k}.\n$$\n\nTo confirm stability, consider a small displacement $x = x_{\\text{eq}} + \\delta x$ with $x_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{m g}{k}$.

This problem presents a particle moving in a potential defined by two different parabolas, and the task is to determine the precise conditions for the equilibrium at the origin to be stable.

This follows from energy conservation $E = \\frac{1}{2} m \\dot{x}^{2} + U(x)$: if $U$ has a strict local minimum at $x_{0}$, then for sufficiently small energies above $U(x_{0})$ the motion is confined to a neighborhood of $x_{0}$; if $U$ fails to have a strict local minimum, there exist arbitrarily small displacements with $U(x) \\leq U(x_{0})$, allowing escape from any neighborhood.\n\nEvaluate the behavior of $U$ near $x=0$:\n$$\nU(x) - U(0) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{1}{2} k_{2} x^{2} & x<0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} k_{1} x^{2} & x>0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nSufficiency: If $k_{1} > 0$ and $k_{2} > 0$, then for all sufficiently small $x \\neq 0$, $U(x) - U(0) > 0$ on both sides, so $x=0$ is a strict local minimum of $U$. Hence the equilibrium is stable.\n\nNecessity:\n- If $k_{1} < 0$ (similarly for $k_{2} < 0$), then for $x>0$ small, $U(x) - U(0) = \\frac{1}{2} k_{1} x^{2} < 0$, so $x=0$ is not a local minimum; moreover, $F(x) = -k_{1} x > 0$ for $x>0$, pushing the particle further away, which is unstable.\n- If $k_{1} = 0$ (similarly for $k_{2} = 0$), then for $x>0$, $U(x) = U(0)$ and $F(x) = 0$. Taking initial data $x(0)=0$, $\\dot{x}(0)=v_{0} > 0$ arbitrarily small yields $x(t) = v_{0} t$ for all $t>0$, which exits any fixed neighborhood in finite time. Thus $x=0$ is not Lyapunov stable.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium at $x=0$ is stable if and only if both $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$ are strictly positive. Among the options, this is exactly option C.
