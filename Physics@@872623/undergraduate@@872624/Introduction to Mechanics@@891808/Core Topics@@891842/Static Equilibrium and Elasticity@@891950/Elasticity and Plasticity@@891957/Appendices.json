This change is related to the transverse strain, which can be found using the given axial strain and Poisson's ratio.\n\nFirst, we state the relationship between transverse strain ($\\epsilon_{\\text{transverse}}$) and axial strain ($\\epsilon_{\\text{axial}}$) via Poisson's ratio ($\\nu$):\n$$\n\\epsilon_{\\text{transverse}} = -\\nu \\epsilon_{\\text{axial}}\n$$\nThe transverse strain is the fractional change in the transverse dimension, which in this case is the diameter $d$. It is defined as:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{\\text{transverse}} = \\frac{\\Delta d}{d_0}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta d$ is the change in diameter and $d_0$ is the initial diameter.\n\nThe axial strain is due to compression, which means the length of the column decreases. Therefore, the axial strain is negative. The problem gives its magnitude as $|\\epsilon_{\\text{axial}}| = 7.50 \\times 10^{-4}$, so we have:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{\\text{axial}} = -7.50 \\times 10^{-4}\n$$\nNow we can combine the equations.

This problem transitions from elasticity to plasticity by exploring the concept of structural collapse. You will analyze how a beam made of an elastic-perfectly plastic material fails by forming \"plastic hinges,\" which turn the structure into a mechanism. This exercise introduces the powerful kinematic method to determine the ultimate collapse load, a cornerstone of plastic design in structural engineering.", "problem": "A structural engineer is analyzing a propped cantilever beam of length $L$. The beam is rigidly fixed at one end and rests on a simple roller support at the other end, allowing for free rotation. The beam is fabricated from an elastic-perfectly plastic material, which means it can sustain a maximum absolute bending moment, known as the fully plastic moment $M_p$, at any cross-section. Beyond this moment, a \"plastic hinge\" forms, allowing the section to rotate under this constant moment. For a safety assessment, a vertical downward point load $P$ is applied at the exact mid-span of the beam, i.e., at a distance of $L/2$ from both ends. Determine the specific magnitude of the load $P$, known as the collapse load, that will cause the formation of a sufficient number of plastic hinges to transform the beam into a collapse mechanism, leading to failure. Express your answer for the collapse load in terms of $M_p$ and $L$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the collapse load $P_c$ for a propped cantilever beam under a point load at mid-span. We can solve this using the kinematic method, which is based on the principle of virtual work.\n\nFirst, we identify the nature of the structure. A propped cantilever beam is statically indeterminate. It has three unknown reaction components (a moment and a vertical force at the fixed end, and a vertical force at the roller support) but only two static equilibrium equations (sum of vertical forces and sum of moments). Therefore, the degree of statical indeterminacy is $3 - 2 = 1$. For a collapse mechanism to form in a structure with a degree of indeterminacy $i$, a total of $n = i + 1$ plastic hinges are required. In this case, we need $n = 1 + 1 = 2$ plastic hinges.\n\nPlastic hinges form at locations of maximum bending moment. For a propped cantilever beam with a load at the mid-span, the points of maximum bending moment are at the fixed support (where the moment is negative) and under the point load at the mid-span (where the moment is positive). Thus, the collapse mechanism will involve the formation of two plastic hinges: one at the fixed end and one at the mid-span.\n\nLet's analyze the geometry of this collapse mechanism. Let the fixed end be at position $x=0$ and the propped end be at $x=L$. The load $P_c$ is at $x=L/2$. Let's assume a small virtual rotation $\\theta$ occurs in the segment of the beam between the fixed end and the mid-span, pivoting about the newly formed plastic hinge at $x=0$.\nThe vertical displacement $\\delta$ at the mid-span (at $x=L/2$) due to this rotation is given by:\n$$ \\delta = \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) \\theta $$\nThis assumes small angles, where $\\tan(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$.\n\nThe other segment of the beam, from the mid-span to the propped end (from $x=L/2$ to $x=L$), must also have a vertical displacement of $\\delta$ at $x=L/2$. This segment pivots around the roller support at $x=L$. Let the rotation of this segment be $\\phi$. The displacement $\\delta$ can be related to $\\phi$:\n$$ \\delta = \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) \\phi $$\nFrom this, we find that $\\phi = \\theta$.\n\nNow we can determine the total rotation at each plastic hinge.\n1. Rotation at the fixed-end hinge (at $x=0$): The rotation of the first segment relative to the fixed support is $\\theta$. So, the rotation at this hinge is $\\theta_A = \\theta$.\n2. Rotation at the mid-span hinge (at $x=L/2$): This is the change in slope across the hinge. The first segment has a slope of $\\theta$, and the second has a slope of $-\\phi = -\\theta$. The total angle of rotation at the hinge is the sum of the magnitudes of these rotations: $\\theta_B = \\theta + \\phi = \\theta + \\theta = 2\\theta$.\n\nAccording to the principle of virtual work, for a system in equilibrium, the external work done by the applied loads during a virtual displacement is equal to the internal work dissipated by the resisting moments.\nExternal Work ($W_{\\text{ext}}$): This is the work done by the collapse load $P_c$ moving through the virtual displacement $\\delta$.\n$$ W_{\\text{ext}} = P_c \\cdot \\delta = P_c \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) \\theta $$\n\nInternal Work ($W_{\\text{int}}$): This is the energy dissipated by the plastic hinges as they rotate. The work done at each hinge is the product of the fully plastic moment $M_p$ and the angle of rotation at that hinge.\n- Work dissipated at the fixed-end hinge: $W_{\\text{int},A} = M_p \\cdot \\theta_A = M_p \\theta$.\n- Work dissipated at the mid-span hinge: $W_{\\text{int},B} = M_p \\cdot \\theta_B = M_p (2\\theta)$.\nThe total internal work is the sum of the work dissipated at both hinges:\n$$ W_{\\text{int}} = W_{\\text{int},A} + W_{\\text{int},B} = M_p \\theta + M_p (2\\theta) = 3M_p \\theta $$\n\nFinally, we equate the external work and the internal work to find the collapse load $P_c$:\n$$ W_{\\text{ext}} = W_{\\text{int}} $$\n$$ P_c \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) \\theta = 3M_p \\theta $$\nThe virtual rotation $\\theta$ is non-zero and cancels from both sides:\n$$ P_c \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) = 3M_p $$\nSolving for $P_c$:\n$$ P_c = \\frac{6M_p}{L} $$\nThis expression gives the magnitude of the point load at mid-span that causes the propped cantilever beam to collapse.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{6M_p}{L}}$$", "id": "2189285"}]}
