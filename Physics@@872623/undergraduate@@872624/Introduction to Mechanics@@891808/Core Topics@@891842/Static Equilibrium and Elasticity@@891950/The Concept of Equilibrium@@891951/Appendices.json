This practice explores the two fundamental ways an object can lose stability on an incline: it can either slide due to insufficient friction or tip over if its center of mass moves past the pivot point.

This surface is then slowly tilted, increasing its angle of inclination $\\theta$ with respect to the horizontal. The coefficient of static friction between the cylinder and the surface is denoted by $\\mu_s$. As the angle $\\theta$ is increased from zero, the cylinder will eventually either begin to slip down the incline or tip over about its bottom edge. There exists a specific value for the aspect ratio, $\\gamma = h/r$, at which the onset of slipping and the onset of tipping occur at the exact same angle of inclination.
