This practice problem focuses on the principle of moments to determine the tipping point of a composite block. By analyzing the torques created by gravity and an applied force about the pivot edge, you will develop the skill to predict the onset of rotational instability, a fundamental concept in engineering and design [@problem_id:2214408].", "problem": "A new construction component is formed by bonding two cubic blocks of equal side length $L$. The lower block has a uniform density $\\rho_2$, and the upper block has a uniform density $\\rho_1$, with $\\rho_1  \\rho_2$. The composite block, of total height $2L$, rests on a flat horizontal floor. The coefficient of static friction between the block and the floor is sufficiently large to ensure that the block will tip before it slides. A horizontal force $F$ is applied perpendicular to one of the vertical faces of the block at a height $h$ above the floor. Assuming the block is a rigid body, find the magnitude of the force $F$ that is just sufficient to start tipping the block. Express your answer in terms of $L$, $h$, $\\rho_1$, $\\rho_2$, and the gravitational acceleration $g$.", "solution": "Let the composite block have a base of width $L$ (horizontal $x$-direction) and height $2L$ (vertical $y$-direction), with the lower cube occupying $0 \\leq y \\leq L$ with density $\\rho_2$, and the upper cube occupying $L \\leq y \\leq 2L$ with density $\\rho_1$. A horizontal force $F$ is applied at height $h$ above the floor on one vertical face. With sufficiently large static friction, the block tips rather than slides; at the onset of tipping, the contact reduces to the bottom edge on the far side, which serves as the pivot. Take the pivot point at the bottom far corner at $(x,y)=(L,0)$.\n\nAt impending tip, the sum of moments about the pivot is zero. The reaction forces at the pivot (normal and friction) pass through the pivot and produce no moment about it. The applied force $F$, acting horizontally at height $h$, has a moment arm equal to $h$ about the pivot, giving a clockwise moment of magnitude $F h$.\n\nThe weights of the two cubes act vertically downward at their respective centers. The lower cube has weight $W_2=\\rho_2 L^3 g$ acting at $(x,y)=(L/2,L/2)$; the upper cube has weight $W_1=\\rho_1 L^3 g$ acting at $(x,y)=(L/2,3L/2)$.

This exercise explores the equilibrium of a rigid bar supported by springs, combining the principles of force and torque balance with Hooke's Law. Solving for the tilt angle after a load is added provides excellent practice in analyzing the system's response to a change, a common task in designing sensitive instruments and structures [@problem_id:2214400].", "problem": "A uniform, rigid bar of length $L$ and mass $M$ is used as a base for a sensitive instrument. To isolate it from vibrations, it is suspended horizontally by two different vertical springs attached to its ends. The spring at the left end (position corresponding to a coordinate of 0) has a spring constant $k_1$, and the spring at the right end (position $L$) has a spring constant $k_2$. An external mechanism has adjusted the unstretched lengths or mounting points of the springs such that the bar is in static equilibrium and perfectly horizontal, accounting for its own weight.\n\nSubsequently, a small, concentrated load of mass $m$ is gently placed on the bar at a distance $x$ from the left end. The system is allowed to settle into a new static equilibrium position. In this new configuration, the bar is tilted at a small angle $\\theta$ with respect to the horizontal.\n\nAssuming the springs remain vertical and that any horizontal displacement of the ends of the bar is negligible, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the tangent of the tilt angle, $\\tan(\\theta)$. Let a positive angle correspond to the right end of the bar being lower than the left end. Your expression should be in terms of $m$, $g$, $L$, $x$, $k_1$, and $k_2$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.", "solution": "The problem asks for the tangent of the tilt angle, $\\tan(\\theta)$, of a bar in static equilibrium after a mass $m$ is added. The bar is supported by two springs and was initially horizontal.\n\nThe key physical principles are the conditions for static equilibrium: the net force on the body must be zero, and the net torque about any point must be zero. Since the springs obey Hooke's Law, the system is linear. This allows us to use the principle of superposition. The final state of the system can be considered as the superposition of the initial state (bar of mass $M$ held horizontally) and the changes introduced by adding the mass $m$. Since the bar is initially horizontal, the tilt angle $\\theta$ is caused entirely by the addition of the mass $m$. Therefore, we can analyze the equilibrium of the changes in forces and torques acting on the bar.\n\nLet $\\delta y_1$ and $\\delta y_2$ be the additional downward vertical displacements of the left and right ends of the bar, respectively, due to the added mass $m$. The change in the upward force from the left spring is $\\Delta F_1 = k_1 \\delta y_1$, and from the right spring is $\\Delta F_2 = k_2 \\delta y_2$. The additional downward force is the weight of the added mass, $mg$, acting at position $x$.\n\nFirst, we apply the condition of force equilibrium for these changes. The sum of the changes in vertical forces must be zero.\n$$\n\\Delta F_1 + \\Delta F_2 - mg = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the spring forces:\n$$\nk_1 \\delta y_1 + k_2 \\delta y_2 = mg\n$$\nThis is our first equation relating the displacements $\\delta y_1$ and $\\delta y_2$.\n\nNext, we apply the condition of torque equilibrium. We can calculate the net torque due to the changes in forces about any point. Choosing the left end of the bar (position 0) as the pivot point simplifies the calculation, as the torque from $\\Delta F_1$ is zero. The forces are $\\Delta F_2$ acting upwards at a lever arm of $L$, and $mg$ acting downwards at a lever arm of $x$. For equilibrium, the net torque is zero.\n$$\n\\sum \\tau_0 = (\\Delta F_2) (L) - (mg)(x) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting $\\Delta F_2 = k_2 \\delta y_2$:\n$$\nk_2 \\delta y_2 L - mgx = 0\n$$\nThis is our second equation. We now have a system of two linear equations for $\\delta y_1$ and $\\delta y_2$.\n\nFrom the torque equilibrium equation, we can solve for $\\delta y_2$:\n$$\nk_2 \\delta y_2 = \\frac{mgx}{L} \\implies \\delta y_2 = \\frac{mgx}{k_2 L}\n$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $\\delta y_2$ (or $k_2 \\delta y_2$) into the force equilibrium equation:\n$$\nk_1 \\delta y_1 + \\frac{mgx}{L} = mg\n$$\nSolving for $\\delta y_1$:\n$$\nk_1 \\delta y_1 = mg - \\frac{mgx}{L} = mg \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{L}\\right) = \\frac{mg(L-x)}{L}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta y_1 = \\frac{mg(L-x)}{k_1 L}\n$$\nThe problem asks for $\\tan(\\theta)$. For a small angle of tilt, the tangent is the slope of the bar, which is the difference in vertical displacement of the ends divided by the length of the bar. A positive angle corresponds to the right end being lower, so $\\delta y_2 > \\delta y_1$.\n$$\n\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{\\delta y_2 - \\delta y_1}{L}\n$$\nSubstituting our expressions for $\\delta y_1$ and $\\delta y_2$:\n$$\n\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{L} \\left( \\frac{mgx}{k_2 L} - \\frac{mg(L-x)}{k_1 L} \\right)\n$$\nWe can factor out common terms:\n$$\n\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{mg}{L^2} \\left( \\frac{x}{k_2} - \\frac{L-x}{k_1} \\right)\n$$\nTo simplify further, we can combine the terms in the parenthesis by finding a common denominator, which is $k_1 k_2$:\n$$\n\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{mg}{L^2} \\left( \\frac{x k_1 - (L-x) k_2}{k_1 k_2} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{mg}{L^2 k_1 k_2} (x k_1 - L k_2 + x k_2)\n$$\nFinally, we group the terms with $x$:\n$$\n\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{mg(x(k_1 + k_2) - L k_2)}{L^2 k_1 k_2}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the tangent of the tilt angle.
