Imagine swinging a bucket of water over your head; what prevents the water from falling out at the top? This exercise reveals that at this critical point, gravity itself provides the necessary centripetal acceleration, leading to the elegant conclusion that the acceleration must be exactly equal to the acceleration due to gravity, $g$ [@problem_id:2182467].", "problem": "A materials science laboratory is testing the adhesive properties of a liquid polymer. In the experiment, a small steel bearing of mass $m$ is coated with the liquid and placed inside a test capsule. This capsule is then attached to the end of a mechanical arm of length $R$ and swung in a vertical circle. A key requirement of the test protocol is that the bearing must maintain contact with the inner surface of the capsule at all times. The system is set to operate at the minimum constant speed necessary to satisfy this condition. Your task is to determine the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration of the steel bearing when it is at the exact highest point of its circular path.\n\nUse the standard acceleration due to gravity, $g = 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2$.\n\nDetermine the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration in m/s².
