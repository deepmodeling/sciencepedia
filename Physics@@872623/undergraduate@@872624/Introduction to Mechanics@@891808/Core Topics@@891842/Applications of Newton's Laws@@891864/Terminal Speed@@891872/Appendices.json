When an object moves through this fluid, it experiences a drag force that is proportional to the square of its speed and its cross-sectional area perpendicular to the direction of motion. The drag force can be written as $F_d = c A v^2$, where $c$ is a constant that depends on the fluid's properties, $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the sphere, and $v$ is the sphere's speed.\n\nConsider two solid ball bearings, Sphere 1 and Sphere 2, made from the same uniform material. Sphere 2 has a radius that is exactly double the radius of Sphere 1. Both spheres are dropped into the same fluid column and are allowed to reach their respective constant terminal speeds, $v_{t1}$ and $v_{t2}$.\n\nDetermine the ratio of the terminal speed of the larger sphere to that of the smaller sphere, $v_{t2} / v_{t1}$. Express your answer as a symbolic expression or a simplified numerical value if possible. Let the acceleration due to gravity be $g$.", "solution": "An object reaches its terminal speed, $v_t$, when the net force acting on it is zero. For a sphere falling through a fluid, there are two primary forces acting along the vertical direction: the downward gravitational force, $F_g$, and the upward drag force, $F_d$.\n\nThe condition for terminal speed is that these two forces are equal in magnitude:\n$$F_g = F_d$$\n\nLet's express each force in terms of the properties of the spheres.\nThe gravitational force is given by $F_g = mg$, where $m$ is the mass of the sphere and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. The mass of a solid sphere can be expressed in terms of its density, $\\rho$, and its volume, $V$. Since both spheres are made of the same material, they have the same density $\\rho$. The volume of a sphere with radius $r$ is $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.\nTherefore, the mass is $m = \\rho V = \\rho \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\right)$.\nThe gravitational force is then:\n$$F_g = \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\rho r^3\\right) g$$\n\nThe drag force is given in the problem statement as $F_d = c A v^2$. At terminal speed, $v = v_t$, so $F_d = c A v_t^2$. The cross-sectional area of a sphere of radius $r$ is that of a circle, so $A = \\pi r^2$.\nThe drag force at terminal speed is:\n$$F_d = c (\\pi r^2) v_t^2$$\n\nNow, we can set the magnitudes of the gravitational and drag forces equal to each other to find an expression for the terminal speed $v_t$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\rho r^3\\right) g = c (\\pi r^2) v_t^2$$\n\nWe can solve this equation for $v_t$. Notice that $\\pi$ and $r^2$ appear on both sides. We can simplify the expression:\n$$\\frac{4}{3}\\rho r g = c v_t^2$$\n$$v_t^2 = \\frac{4 \\rho g}{3 c} r$$\nTaking the square root of both sides gives the terminal speed as a function of the sphere's radius:\n$$v_t = \\sqrt{\\frac{4 \\rho g}{3 c} r}$$\n\nThis equation shows that the terminal speed $v_t$ is proportional to the square root of the radius, $r$. We can write this relationship as $v_t = K \\sqrt{r}$, where $K = \\sqrt{\\frac{4 \\rho g}{3 c}}$ is a constant that is the same for both spheres since they are made of the same material ($\\rho$), fall in the same gravitational field ($g$), and move through the same fluid ($c$).\n\nLet $r_1$ and $v_{t1}$ be the radius and terminal speed of Sphere 1, and let $r_2$ and $v_{t2}$ be the radius and terminal speed of Sphere 2. We have:\n$$v_{t1} = K \\sqrt{r_1}$$\n$$v_{t2} = K \\sqrt{r_2}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio $v_{t2} / v_{t1}$:\n$$\\frac{v_{t2}}{v_{t1}} = \\frac{K \\sqrt{r_2}}{K \\sqrt{r_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_2}{r_1}}$$\n\nThe problem states that the radius of Sphere 2 is double the radius of Sphere 1, so $r_2 = 2r_1$. Substituting this into the ratio:\n$$\\frac{v_{t2}}{v_{t1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2r_1}{r_1}} = \\sqrt{2}$$\n\nThus, the ratio of the terminal speed of the larger sphere to that of the smaller sphere is $\\sqrt{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{2}}$$", "id": "2217125"}, {"introduction": "After analyzing the equilibrium state of terminal speed, it is instructive to explore the full dynamics of motion when air resistance is present.
