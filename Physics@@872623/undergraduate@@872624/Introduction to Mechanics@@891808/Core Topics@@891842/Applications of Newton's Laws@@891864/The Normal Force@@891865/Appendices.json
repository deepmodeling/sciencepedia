This first exercise is designed to directly challenge that idea. By analyzing a cart on a horizontal track subjected to an external force at an angle, you will see how the normal force is an adjustable contact force that responds to all vertical forces acting on an object [@problem_id:2221924].", "problem": "In a physics laboratory, a setup is designed to study dynamics. A cart of mass $M$ rests on a long, flat, horizontal track. It is connected by a light, inextensible string that passes over an ideal, frictionless pulley to a block of mass $m$, which hangs vertically. To initiate and sustain motion, a constant external force of magnitude $F$ is applied to the cart at a constant angle $\\theta$ below the horizontal. The system begins to accelerate from rest. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the cart and the track is $\\mu_k$.\n\nYour task is to determine the magnitude of the normal force exerted by the track on the cart. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of any or all of the given parameters $M$, $m$, $F$, $\\theta$, $\\mu_k$, and the acceleration due to gravity $g$.", "solution": "Choose a right-handed coordinate system with the $x$-axis horizontal along the track and the $y$-axis vertical upward. Consider the free-body diagram of the cart of mass $M$.\n\nForces on the cart:\n- Weight: $Mg$ downward.\n- Normal force from the track: $N$ upward.\n- Applied force of magnitude $F$ at angle $\\theta$ below the horizontal: horizontal component $F\\cos\\theta$ (along $x$), vertical component $F\\sin\\theta$ downward (along $-y$).\n- Kinetic friction of magnitude $f_k=\\mu_k N$ acting along the track, opposing the direction of motion (purely horizontal).\n- String tension from the hanging mass acts purely horizontally on the cart (the string segment along the track is horizontal), so it has no vertical component.\n\nThe cart does not accelerate vertically, so its vertical acceleration is zero. Applying Newton’s second law in the vertical direction gives\n$$\n\\sum F_{y}=Ma_{y}=0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad N - Mg - F\\sin\\theta = 0.\n$$\nSolving for the normal force yields\n$$\nN = Mg + F\\sin\\theta.\n$$\nThis result is independent of $m$ and $\\mu_{k}$ because neither affects the vertical force balance on the cart.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{Mg+F\\sin\\theta}$$", "id": "2221924"}, {"introduction": "Building on the previous example, we now explore how the normal force behaves in more complex settings, specifically on an inclined plane and within an accelerating reference frame. This problem requires you to combine your understanding of force components with the concept of an effective gravitational field [@problem_id:2221927]. It demonstrates that the normal force is always perpendicular to the contact surface and counteracts only the force components pressing into that surface.", "problem": "Two rectangular blocks are stacked one on top of the other and placed on a frictionless ramp. The top block has a mass $m_1$ and the bottom block has a mass $m_2$. The ramp is inclined at an angle $\\theta$ with respect to the horizontal. The entire setup, including the ramp and the blocks, is located inside an elevator which is accelerating vertically upwards with a constant acceleration of magnitude $a$. The blocks are observed to slide down the ramp together without slipping relative to each other. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$. Determine the magnitude of the normal force exerted by the bottom block (mass $m_2$) on the top block (mass $m_1$). Express your answer in terms of $m_1$, $g$, $a$, and $\\theta$.", "solution": "Work in the non-inertial frame of the elevator, which is accelerating vertically upward with constant acceleration of magnitude $a$. In this frame, each mass experiences, in addition to real forces, a fictitious inertial force of magnitude $m a$ directed downward (opposite the elevator’s acceleration). For the top block of mass $m_{1}$, the downward forces are gravity $m_{1}g$ and the inertial force $m_{1}a$, so the combined effective downward force is equivalent to an effective gravitational field of magnitude $g_{\\text{eff}}=g+a$.\n\nLet the incline make an angle $\\theta$ with the horizontal. Decompose forces perpendicular to the plane. The normal force $N$ exerted by the bottom block on the top block acts perpendicular to the plane, and the component of the effective weight $m_{1}(g+a)$ perpendicular to the plane is $m_{1}(g+a)\\cos\\theta$ pressing the blocks together. Because the top block remains in contact with the bottom block and the plane is at rest in this frame, the acceleration of the top block perpendicular to the plane is zero. Applying Newton’s second law perpendicular to the plane gives\n$$\nN - m_{1}(g+a)\\cos\\theta = 0,\n$$\nso\n$$\nN = m_{1}(g+a)\\cos\\theta.\n$$\nThis is the magnitude of the normal force exerted by the bottom block on the top block; it is independent of $m_{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{m_{1}(g+a)\\cos\\theta}$$", "id": "2221927"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice problem examines systems of objects and how internal motion affects external forces. By considering a robot moving inside a container that rests on a scale, you will analyze how the acceleration of a part of a system can change the normal force exerted on the entire system by its support [@problem_id:2221967].

Inside the container, a small, autonomous robotic cleaner of mass $m$ is tasked with inspecting the interior vertical wall. The robot initiates a pre-programmed cleaning cycle, starting from rest on the container's floor. It begins to move in a helical path up the wall. Its motion, relative to the stationary container, is characterized by a constant upward vertical acceleration, $a_y$, and a constant angular velocity, $\\omega$, about the central axis of the cylinder. The container itself does not move or tilt. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$.\n\nDerive a symbolic expression for the reading on the scale. The scale measures the magnitude of the total normal force exerted on it by the container.", "solution": "Let the vertical axis be $y$ (upward positive). The container is stationary in the inertial lab frame. The robot’s motion relative to the container has a constant vertical acceleration $a_{y}$ upward and a constant angular velocity $\\omega$ about the central axis at radius $R$. The angular motion requires a horizontal centripetal force $m R \\omega^2$ from the wall; this horizontal interaction has no vertical component and therefore does not affect the vertical force measured by the scale.\n\nConsider the combined system consisting of the container (mass $M$) and the robot (mass $m$).

By Newton’s third law, the robot exerts a downward force of the same magnitude on the container, thereby increasing the scale reading by $m(g+a_y)$ above the container’s own weight $Mg$, yielding the same result $N = (M+m)g + m a_{y}$. The dependence on $\\omega$ and $R$ drops out because the associated forces are horizontal.\n\nTherefore, the scale reading (the magnitude of the normal force on the scale) is\n$$\nN = (M+m)g + m\\,a_{y}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(M+m)g+m a_{y}}$$", "id": "2221967"}]}
