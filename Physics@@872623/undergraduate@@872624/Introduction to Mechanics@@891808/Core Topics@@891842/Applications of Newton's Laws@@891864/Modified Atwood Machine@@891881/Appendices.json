A rectangular block, Block A, of mass $m_A$, rests on a long, perfectly smooth, horizontal tabletop. This block is connected by a new type of lightweight, inextensible filament to a second block, Block B, of mass $m_B$. The filament runs horizontally from Block A to the edge of the table, passes over an ideal, frictionless pulley, and hangs vertically downwards, attached to Block B. The entire system is held at rest. At time $t=0$, the system is released.\n\nDerive a symbolic expression for the time $t$ it takes for Block A to travel a horizontal distance $L$ from its starting point. Assume that during this time, Block B does not hit the floor and Block A does not reach the pulley. Your answer should be expressed in terms of the given parameters: $m_A$, $m_B$, $L$, and the acceleration due to gravity, $g$.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we will first determine the acceleration of the system by applying Newton's second law to each block, and then use a kinematic equation to find the time required for Block A to travel the given distance.\n\nLet $a$ be the magnitude of the acceleration of both blocks, as they are connected by an inextensible filament. Let $T$ be the tension in the filament. We define the positive direction for Block A to be horizontal and towards the pulley, and the positive direction for Block B to be vertically downwards.\n\nFirst, consider the forces acting on Block A. In the vertical direction, the gravitational force $m_A g$ is balanced by the normal force from the table, so there is no vertical acceleration. In the horizontal direction, the only force is the tension $T$ from the filament. Applying Newton's second law ($\\sum F = ma$) to Block A in the horizontal direction gives:\n$$T = m_A a$$\n\nNext, consider the forces acting on Block B. In the vertical direction, there are two forces: the gravitational force $m_B g$ acting downwards and the tension $T$ acting upwards. Applying Newton's second law to Block B in the vertical direction gives:\n$$m_B g - T = m_B a$$\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $a$ and $T$. We can solve for the acceleration $a$ by substituting the expression for $T$ from the first equation into the second equation:\n$$m_B g - (m_A a) = m_B a$$\nNow, we rearrange the equation to solve for $a$:\n$$m_B g = m_A a + m_B a$$\n$$m_B g = (m_A + m_B) a$$\n$$a = \\frac{m_B g}{m_A + m_B}$$\nThis is the constant acceleration of the system.\n\nNow that we have the acceleration, we can use kinematics to find the time $t$. Block A starts from rest, so its initial velocity $v_0$ is 0. It travels a distance $L$ with constant acceleration $a$. The relevant kinematic equation relating distance, initial velocity, acceleration, and time is:\n$$L = v_0 t + \\frac{1}{2} a t^2$$\nSubstituting $v_0 = 0$, we get:\n$$L = \\frac{1}{2} a t^2$$\nWe can now solve for the time $t$:\n$$t^2 = \\frac{2L}{a}$$\n$$t = \\sqrt{\\frac{2L}{a}}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the expression for the acceleration $a$ that we derived earlier into this equation for $t$:\n$$t = \\sqrt{\\frac{2L}{\\frac{m_B g}{m_A + m_B}}}$$\nSimplifying the expression gives the final result:\n$$t = \\sqrt{2L \\left( \\frac{m_A + m_B}{m_B g} \\right)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2L(m_A + m_B)}{m_B g}}$$\nThis is the time it takes for Block A to travel a distance $L$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{2L(m_A + m_B)}{m_B g}}}$$", "id": "2200013"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the ideal case, we now introduce the real-world effect of friction. This problem challenges you to work in reverse: instead of calculating the motion of a given system, you will determine the necessary frictional properties to achieve a specific, desired acceleration.

To control its descent, the component is connected by a light, inextensible cable that passes over a massless, frictionless pulley to a braking cart of mass $m$. The cart moves along a rough horizontal track. The system is designed such that the heavy component descends with a constant, non-zero acceleration $a$, where $a < g$. Let $g$ be the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nAssuming the cable remains taut throughout the motion, derive a symbolic expression for the required coefficient of kinetic friction, $\\mu_k$, between the braking cart and the track. Your expression should be in terms of $M$, $m$, $a$, and $g$.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we will apply Newton's second law to both the hanging component and the braking cart. We will analyze the forces acting on each object to set up two equations of motion, which can then be solved simultaneously for the unknown coefficient of kinetic friction, $\\mu_k$.\n\nFirst, let's consider the heavy component of mass $M$. There are two forces acting on it: the gravitational force, $F_{g,M} = Mg$, acting downwards, and the tension in the cable, $T$, acting upwards. We define the downward direction as positive, consistent with the acceleration $a$ of the component. Applying Newton's second law, $\\sum F = Ma$, to this mass gives:\n$$Mg - T = Ma$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the tension $T$:\n$$T = Mg - Ma = M(g - a)$$\n\nNext, let's analyze the braking cart of mass $m$. The cart moves horizontally, so we must consider forces in both the horizontal and vertical directions.\nIn the vertical direction, the cart is not accelerating. The forces are the gravitational force, $F_{g,m} = mg$, acting downwards, and the normal force, $N$, exerted by the track on the cart, acting upwards. Since the net vertical force is zero:\n$$N - mg = 0$$\nThis implies that the normal force is equal to the weight of the cart:\n$$N = mg$$\n\nIn the horizontal direction, the cart is connected to the hanging mass and thus accelerates to the right with the same acceleration magnitude $a$. The forces acting horizontally are the tension $T$ from the cable, pulling the cart to the right, and the force of kinetic friction, $f_k$, opposing the motion and acting to the left. Let the rightward direction be positive. Applying Newton's second law, $\\sum F = ma$, to the horizontal motion of the cart gives:\n$$T - f_k = ma$$\nThe force of kinetic friction is defined as the product of the coefficient of kinetic friction and the normal force: $f_k = \\mu_k N$. Substituting our expression for the normal force, we get:\n$$f_k = \\mu_k (mg)$$\nNow, we can substitute this expression for $f_k$ back into the horizontal equation of motion for the cart:\n$$T - \\mu_k mg = ma$$\n\nAt this point, we have two expressions, one for tension $T$ from the analysis of mass $M$, and another equation involving $T$ from the analysis of mass $m$. We can substitute the expression for $T$ from the first analysis, $T = M(g-a)$, into the second equation:\n$$M(g - a) - \\mu_k mg = ma$$\nOur goal is to solve for $\\mu_k$. We can rearrange the equation to isolate the term containing $\\mu_k$:\n$$\\mu_k mg = M(g - a) - ma$$\nFinally, we divide both sides by $mg$ to obtain the expression for the coefficient of kinetic friction:\n$$\\mu_k = \\frac{M(g - a) - ma}{mg}$$\nThis can also be written as:\n$$\\mu_k = \\frac{M(g-a)}{mg} - \\frac{a}{g}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{M(g-a) - ma}{mg}}$$", "id": "2199999"}, {"introduction": "This final practice exercise integrates our understanding of dynamics and kinematics into a multi-stage scenario.
