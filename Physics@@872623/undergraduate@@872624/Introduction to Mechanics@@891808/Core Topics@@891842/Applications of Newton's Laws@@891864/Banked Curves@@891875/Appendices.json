The ramp is a circular arc with a radius of curvature $R$ and is banked at an angle $\\theta$ with respect to the horizontal. The surface of the road provides a coefficient of static friction $\\mu_s$ between a car's tires and the pavement. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$.\n\nA car, treated as a point mass, must be able to navigate the curve at a range of speeds without slipping either up or down the bank. This defines a maximum safe speed, $v_{max}$, and a minimum safe speed, $v_{min}$. To ensure that a car can navigate the turn even at very low speeds without sliding down, the banking is designed to be sufficiently steep such that $v_{min}$ is real and greater than zero. This condition is met when $\\tan\\theta > \\mu_s$.\n\nYour task is to find a symbolic expression for the square of the ratio of the maximum safe speed to the minimum safe speed, $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{v_{min}^2}$.
