The initial design consists of a uniform solid disk of mass $M_d$ and radius $R$, suspended horizontally from its center by a thin wire. This setup forms a torsional pendulum that oscillates with a period $T$. For a revised design, the engineer wants to replace the solid disk with a uniform solid sphere of the same radius $R$ and mass $M_s$. The new sphere will be suspended from its center using an identical wire. What must be the mass of the sphere, $M_s$, in terms of the mass of the disk, $M_d$, for the new torsional pendulum to have the exact same oscillation period $T$?", "solution": "The period of a torsional pendulum is given by the formula $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{I}{\\kappa}}$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia of the oscillating object about the axis of rotation, and $\\kappa$ is the torsional constant of the suspension wire.\n\nFirst, let's write the expression for the period of the initial design, which uses the solid disk. The object is a uniform solid disk of mass $M_d$ and radius $R$. It is suspended from its center, so the axis of rotation is the axis perpendicular to the plane of the disk and passing through its center. The moment of inertia of a uniform solid disk about this axis is given by:\n$$I_d = \\frac{1}{2} M_d R^2$$\nThe period of the disk-based pendulum, which we are told is $T$, is therefore:\n$$T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{I_d}{\\kappa}} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} M_d R^2}{\\kappa}}$$\n\nNext, let's write the expression for the period of the revised design, which uses the solid sphere. The object is a uniform solid sphere of mass $M_s$ and radius $R$. It is suspended from its center, so the axis of rotation passes through its center. The moment of inertia of a uniform solid sphere about an axis passing through its center is given by:\n$$I_s = \\frac{2}{5} M_s R^2$$\nThe suspension wire is identical to the one used for the disk, so its torsional constant is also $\\kappa$. The period of the sphere-based pendulum is:\n$$T_{\\text{sphere}} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{I_s}{\\kappa}} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{2}{5} M_s R^2}{\\kappa}}$$\n\nThe problem requires that the period of the new pendulum is also $T$. Therefore, we must set the period of the sphere-based pendulum equal to the period of the disk-based pendulum:\n$$T = T_{\\text{sphere}}$$\n$$2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} M_d R^2}{\\kappa}} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{2}{5} M_s R^2}{\\kappa}}$$\n\nTo solve for $M_s$, we can first square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots:\n$$\\left(2\\pi\\right)^2 \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} M_d R^2}{\\kappa} = \\left(2\\pi\\right)^2 \\frac{\\frac{2}{5} M_s R^2}{\\kappa}$$\nNow, we can cancel the common terms on both sides of the equation. The terms $(2\\pi)^2$, $R^2$ (since the radius is non-zero), and $\\kappa$ (the wire constant is non-zero) can all be cancelled:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} M_d = \\frac{2}{5} M_s$$\nFinally, we can rearrange this equation to solve for $M_s$ in terms of $M_d$:\n$$M_s = \\frac{5}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} M_d$$\n$$M_s = \\frac{5}{4} M_d$$\nSo, for the periods to be identical, the mass of the sphere must be $5/4$ times the mass of the disk.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{5}{4} M_d}$$", "id": "2225714"}, {"introduction": "A defining characteristic of simple harmonic motion is that its period is independent of the amplitude of oscillation, a property known as isochronism.
