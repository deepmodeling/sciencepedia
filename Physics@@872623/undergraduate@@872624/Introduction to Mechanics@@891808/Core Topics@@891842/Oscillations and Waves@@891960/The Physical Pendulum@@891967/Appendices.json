This component consists of a solid, uniform circular disk of mass $M$ and radius $R$. The disk is designed to oscillate freely under gravity about a pivot point. This pivot is located on a line passing through the center of the disk, at a distance $r$ from the center, where $0 < r \\le R$. The performance of the timing device is optimal when the component oscillates with the highest possible frequency (or, equivalently, the shortest possible period) for small-angle displacements. Your task is to determine the specific distance $r$ from the disk's center at which it should be pivoted to achieve this minimum period of oscillation.\n\nExpress your answer for $r$ as a symbolic expression in terms of the disk's radius $R$.", "solution": "The component described is a physical pendulum. The period $T$ of a physical pendulum undergoing small-angle oscillations is given by the formula:\n$$T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{I}{mgd}}$$\nwhere $I$ is the moment of inertia of the object about the pivot point, $m$ is the total mass of the object, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $d$ is the distance from the pivot point to the center of mass of the object.\n\nFor the given uniform circular disk, the mass is $m=M$, and the distance from the pivot to the center of mass is $d=r$.\n\nWe need to find the moment of inertia $I$ of the disk about the pivot point. We can use the parallel-axis theorem, which states that $I = I_{cm} + md^2$. Here, $I_{cm}$ is the moment of inertia about an axis passing through the center of mass and parallel to the pivot axis. For a solid, uniform disk of mass $M$ and radius $R$, the moment of inertia about its center is $I_{cm} = \\frac{1}{2}MR^2$.\n\nSubstituting $I_{cm} = \\frac{1}{2}MR^2$ and $d = r$ into the parallel-axis theorem, we get the moment of inertia about the pivot:\n$$I = \\frac{1}{2}MR^2 + Mr^2$$\n\nNow, we can substitute $I = \\frac{1}{2}MR^2 + Mr^2$, $m=M$, and $d=r$ into the period formula:\n$$T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}MR^2 + Mr^2}{Mgr}}$$\nWe can cancel the mass $M$ from the numerator and denominator inside the square root:\n$$T(r) = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}R^2 + r^2}{gr}}$$\n\nTo find the value of $r$ that minimizes the period $T$, we can equivalently find the value of $r$ that minimizes the square of the period, $T^2$, as this simplifies the calculus by removing the square root.
