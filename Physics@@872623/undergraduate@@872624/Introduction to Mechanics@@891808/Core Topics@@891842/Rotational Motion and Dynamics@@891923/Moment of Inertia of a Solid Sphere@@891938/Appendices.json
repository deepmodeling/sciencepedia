We can solve this by using the principle of superposition. The moment of inertia of the object with the cavity, $I_{rotor}$, is equal to the moment of inertia of a full, solid sphere, $I_{full}$, minus the moment of inertia of the mass that would have filled the void, $I_{void}$. Both moments of inertia must be calculated with respect to the same axis of rotation, which is the z-axis passing through the origin.\n\n$$I_{rotor} = I_{full} - I_{void}$$\n\nLet $\\rho$ be the uniform mass density of the material.
