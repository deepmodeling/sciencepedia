{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "This first practice brings us back to the fundamental definition of work as the dot product of force and displacement, $W = \\int \\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{s}$. By considering a force that is not perfectly aligned with the direction of motion, this exercise challenges you to decompose the force vector and identify which component contributes to the work done on the rotating system. Mastering this principle is essential for correctly analyzing any real-world scenario where forces are not applied in an idealized manner [@problem_id:2230658].", "problem": "A flat, circular satellite component of radius $R$ is floating in the vacuum of space, free to rotate about an axis passing through its center and perpendicular to its plane. A small thruster is mounted on the edge of this component. When activated, the thruster provides a constant force of magnitude $F$. This force vector lies in the plane of the circular component.\n\nDue to a slight manufacturing misalignment, the direction of the force is not purely tangential. Instead, it maintains a constant angle $\\phi$ with respect to the local radial line drawn from the center of the component to the thruster's point of application. The angle is defined such that $\\phi=0$ would correspond to a force pushing directly away from the center (radially outward), and $\\phi=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians would correspond to a force perfectly tangent to the edge in the direction of rotation.\n\nThe thruster is fired continuously as the component rotates through exactly one full revolution. Determine the total work $W$ done by the thruster's force on the component during this single revolution. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $F$, $R$, and $\\phi$.", "solution": "The work $W$ done by a force $\\vec{F}$ over a path is given by the line integral:\n$$W = \\int_{C} \\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{s}$$\nwhere $d\\vec{s}$ is the infinitesimal displacement vector along the path $C$.\n\nLet's set up a polar coordinate system $(r, \\theta)$ in the plane of the circular component, with the origin at the center. The thruster is located at a fixed radius $r=R$. The path of the thruster is a circle of radius $R$.\n\nThe infinitesimal displacement vector $d\\vec{s}$ for a point moving on this circle is purely tangential. Its magnitude is the arc length $ds = R d\\theta$, and its direction is the tangential unit vector $\\hat{\\theta}$. So, we can write:\n$$d\\vec{s} = R d\\theta \\, \\hat{\\theta}$$\n\nNext, we need to express the force vector $\\vec{F}$ in terms of the polar unit vectors, $\\hat{r}$ (radial) and $\\hat{\\theta}$ (tangential). The radial unit vector $\\hat{r}$ points from the center to the point of application. The tangential unit vector $\\hat{\\theta}$ is perpendicular to $\\hat{r}$ and points in the direction of motion.\n\nThe problem states that the force $\\vec{F}$ makes a constant angle $\\phi$ with the radial line. Based on the definition given, the component of the force along the radial direction is $F_r = F \\cos(\\phi)$, and the component along the tangential direction is $F_t = F \\sin(\\phi)$. Therefore, the force vector can be written as:\n$$\\vec{F} = F \\cos(\\phi) \\, \\hat{r} + F \\sin(\\phi) \\, \\hat{\\theta}$$\n\nNow we can compute the dot product $\\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{s}$:\n$$\\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{s} = (F \\cos(\\phi) \\, \\hat{r} + F \\sin(\\phi) \\, \\hat{\\theta}) \\cdot (R d\\theta \\, \\hat{\\theta})$$\n\nThe dot product of orthogonal unit vectors is zero ($\\hat{r} \\cdot \\hat{\\theta} = 0$), and the dot product of a unit vector with itself is one ($\\hat{\\theta} \\cdot \\hat{\\theta} = 1$). Expanding the dot product gives:\n$$\\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{s} = (F \\cos(\\phi))(R d\\theta)(\\hat{r} \\cdot \\hat{\\theta}) + (F \\sin(\\phi))(R d\\theta)(\\hat{\\theta} \\cdot \\hat{\\theta})$$\n$$\\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{s} = 0 + F R \\sin(\\phi) d\\theta$$\nThis confirms that only the tangential component of the force does work.\n\nThe total work done is the integral of this expression over one full revolution. A full revolution corresponds to the angle $\\theta$ changing from $0$ to $2\\pi$ radians.\n$$W = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} F R \\sin(\\phi) \\, d\\theta$$\n\nSince the force magnitude $F$, the radius $R$, and the angle $\\phi$ are all constants, we can take the term $F R \\sin(\\phi)$ outside the integral:\n$$W = F R \\sin(\\phi) \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta$$\n\nEvaluating the simple integral gives:\n$$W = F R \\sin(\\phi) [\\theta]_{0}^{2\\pi} = F R \\sin(\\phi) (2\\pi - 0)$$\n$$W = 2 \\pi F R \\sin(\\phi)$$\n\nAlternatively, we can solve this problem using the concept of torque. The work done by a torque $\\tau$ over an angular displacement $\\Delta\\theta$ is $W = \\int \\tau \\, d\\theta$. The torque about the center is given by $\\vec{\\tau} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}$, where $\\vec{r}$ is the position vector from the center to the point where the force is applied.\nHere, $\\vec{r} = R\\,\\hat{r}$.\n$$\\vec{\\tau} = (R\\,\\hat{r}) \\times (F \\cos(\\phi) \\, \\hat{r} + F \\sin(\\phi) \\, \\hat{\\theta})$$\n$$\\vec{\\tau} = R F \\cos(\\phi) (\\hat{r} \\times \\hat{r}) + R F \\sin(\\phi) (\\hat{r} \\times \\hat{\\theta})$$\nSince $\\hat{r} \\times \\hat{r} = 0$ and $\\hat{r} \\times \\hat{\\theta} = \\hat{k}$ (the unit vector perpendicular to the plane), the torque vector is:\n$$\\vec{\\tau} = R F \\sin(\\phi) \\, \\hat{k}$$\nThe magnitude of the torque is constant: $\\tau = R F \\sin(\\phi)$.\nThe work done for one revolution ($\\Delta\\theta=2\\pi$) is:\n$$W = \\tau \\Delta\\theta = (R F \\sin(\\phi))(2\\pi)$$\n$$W = 2 \\pi F R \\sin(\\phi)$$\nBoth methods yield the same result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2 \\pi F R \\sin(\\phi)}$$", "id": "2230658"}, {"introduction": "Building on the definition of work, this problem explores the direct consequences of applying a net torque to an object. This exercise connects the concepts of work, torque, and rotational kinetic energy through the work-energy theorem.
