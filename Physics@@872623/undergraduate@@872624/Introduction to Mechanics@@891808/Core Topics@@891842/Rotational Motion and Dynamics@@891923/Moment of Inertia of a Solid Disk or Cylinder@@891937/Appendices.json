The moment of inertia of the final object, $I_{final}$, is the moment of inertia of the original solid cylinder, $I_{solid}$, minus the moment of inertia of the removed cylindrical part, $I_{removed}$, both calculated about the same axis of rotation. The specified axis of rotation is the central axis of the original solid cylinder.\n\nLet the uniform density of the material be $\\rho$ and the length of the cylinder be $L$.\n\nFirst, we need to relate the masses of the various parts to the given mass $M$ of the final object.\nThe volume of the original solid cylinder (radius $R$) is $V_{solid} = \\pi R^{2} L$.\nThe volume of the cylindrical hole (radius $r = R/2$) is $V_{removed} = \\pi r^{2} L = \\pi (R/2)^{2} L = \\frac{1}{4} \\pi R^{2} L$.\nThe volume of the final object is the difference between these two volumes:\n$V_{final} = V_{solid} - V_{removed} = \\pi R^{2} L - \\frac{1}{4} \\pi R^{2} L = \\frac{3}{4} \\pi R^{2} L$.\n\nThe mass of the final object is given as $M$.
