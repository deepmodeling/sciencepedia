The AUV moves horizontally at a constant velocity $v_0$. It carries a large spool of cable, which has a uniform linear mass density $\\lambda$. As the AUV moves, the cable unspools and is laid down on the seabed, where it comes to rest. Assume the surrounding water currents are negligible and any buoyant or drag forces on the AUV itself are constant and balanced by a static component of the AUV's propulsion system. Determine the magnitude of the additional dynamic force $F$ that the AUV's thrusters must exert on the vehicle *solely* to counteract the effect of the changing mass and maintain the constant velocity $v_0$.
