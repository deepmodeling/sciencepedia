The setup consists of two sequential collisions: First, the incident particle of mass $m$ strikes a stationary intermediate particle of mass $M$. Second, this intermediate particle, set in motion by the first collision, strikes the stationary target particle of mass $m_T$. Assuming all collisions are perfectly elastic and constrained to the one-dimensional line, determine the mass $M$ of the intermediate particle that accomplishes this goal.

The intermediate mass $M$ and the target mass $m_{T}$ are initially at rest. All collisions are perfectly elastic and one-dimensional.\n\nFor a one-dimensional elastic collision, we use conservation of linear momentum and kinetic energy. Equivalently, we may use conservation of momentum together with the relative speed reversal property: the relative speed after collision equals the relative speed before collision in magnitude, with reversed sign.\n\nFirst collision (mass $m$ with speed $u$ hits stationary $M$):\n- Momentum: $m u = m v_{m1} + M V_{1}$.\n- Relative speed reversal: $V_{1} - v_{m1} = u$.\nFrom momentum, $m(u - v_{m1}) = M V_{1}$. Using $V_{1} = u + v_{m1}$ from the reversal, we get $m(u - v_{m1}) = M(u + v_{m1})$. Solving for $v_{m1}$ yields\n$$\nv_{m1} = \\frac{m - M}{m + M}\\,u,\n$$\nand then\n$$\nV_{1} = u + v_{m1} = \\frac{2 m}{m + M}\\,u.\n$$\n\nSecond collision (mass $M$ with speed $V_{1}$ hits stationary $m_{T}$):\n- Momentum: $M V_{1} = M V_{2} + m_{T} v_{T}$.\n- Relative speed reversal: $v_{T} - V_{2} = V_{1}$.\nFrom the reversal, $V_{2} = v_{T} - V_{1}$. Substitute into momentum to get $M V_{1} = M(v_{T} - V_{1}) + m_{T} v_{T}$, so $2 M V_{1} = (M + m_{T}) v_{T}$, hence\n$$\nv_{T} = \\frac{2 M}{M + m_{T}}\\,V_{1} = \\frac{2 M}{M + m_{T}} \\cdot \\frac{2 m}{m + M}\\,u.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the target’s kinetic energy after the second collision is\n$$\nK_{T} = \\frac{1}{2} m_{T} v_{T}^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} m_{T} u^{2} \\left[\\frac{4 m M}{(m + M)(M + m_{T})}\\right]^{2}.\n$$\nFor fixed $m$, $m_{T}$, and $u$, maximizing $K_{T}$ with respect to $M$ is equivalent to maximizing\n$$\nf(M) = \\left[\\frac{M}{(M + m)(M + m_{T})}\\right]^{2}.\n$$\nDefine\n$$\ng(M) = \\ln f(M) = 2 \\ln M - 2 \\ln(M + m) - 2 \\ln(M + m_{T}).\n$$\nSet the derivative to zero:\n$$\ng'(M) = 2\\left(\\frac{1}{M} - \\frac{1}{M + m} - \\frac{1}{M + m_{T}}\\right) = 0,\n$$\nwhich gives\n$$\n\\frac{1}{M} = \\frac{1}{M + m} + \\frac{1}{M + m_{T}} = \\frac{2 M + m + m_{T}}{(M + m)(M + m_{T})}.\n$$\nCross-multiplying,\n$$\n(M + m)(M + m_{T}) = M(2 M + m + m_{T}).\n$$\nExpanding and simplifying,\n$$\nM^{2} + M(m + m_{T}) + m m_{T} = 2 M^{2} + M(m + m_{T}) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad M^{2} = m m_{T}.\n$$\nSince $M > 0$, the maximizing mass is\n$$\nM = \\sqrt{m m_{T}}.\n$$\nAs $M \\to 0^{+}$ or $M \\to \\infty$, $f(M) \\to 0$, so this critical point yields the global maximum.\n\nTherefore, the intermediate mass that maximizes the kinetic energy transferred to the target is the geometric mean of $m$ and $m_{T}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{m m_{T}}}$$", "id": "2206448"}, {"introduction": "Collisions often occur within systems that constrain the subsequent motion of the objects.
