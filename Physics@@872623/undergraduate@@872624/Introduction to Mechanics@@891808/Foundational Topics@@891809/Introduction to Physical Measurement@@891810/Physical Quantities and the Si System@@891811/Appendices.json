The condition \"roll without slipping\" implies that for every full revolution of the tire, the car moves forward by a distance equal to the tire's circumference.\n\nLet $C$ be the circumference of the tire. The total distance traveled $D$ is the number of revolutions $N$ multiplied by the circumference $C$.\n$$D = N \\times C$$\n\nWe can solve this for the number of revolutions $N$:\n$$N = \\frac{D}{C}$$\n\nThe circumference $C$ of the tire is related to its diameter $d$ by the formula:\n$$C = \\pi d$$\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $N$, we get:\n$$N = \\frac{D}{\\pi d}$$\n\nThe problem provides the values for $D$ and $d$ in different units: $D = 500.0 \\text{ km}$ and $d = 70.0 \\text{ cm}$. To perform the calculation, we must convert them to a consistent unit. The standard SI unit for length is the meter (m).\n\nLet's convert the diameter $d$ from centimeters to meters.
