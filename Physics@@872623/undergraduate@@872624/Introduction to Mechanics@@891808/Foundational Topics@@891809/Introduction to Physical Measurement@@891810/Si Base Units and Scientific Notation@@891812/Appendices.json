This method relies on the momentum transfer from photons emitted by the Sun, which creates a small but continuous radiation pressure on the sail. At a certain point in its trajectory, the probe fully deploys its square-shaped sail so that it is perfectly perpendicular to the incoming solar radiation. At this distance from the Sun, the solar radiation exerts a constant pressure of $P = 9.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ Pa. The sail is a perfect square with a side length of $L = 512$ m.
