This exercise [@problem_id:2191090] asks you to analyze the motion of an insect crawling with a constant radial velocity, $v_r$, on a spinning turntable. By determining the point at which the required static friction exceeds its maximum value, you will gain hands-on experience in calculating and combining the outward-directed centrifugal force and the tangential Coriolis force.", "problem": "An insect of mass $m$ is on a large horizontal turntable, which is spinning at a constant angular velocity $\\omega$.

Assuming the insect can start its journey without immediately slipping, at what radial distance $r$ from the center will it inevitably begin to slip? Your answer should be a closed-form analytic expression.", "solution": "This problem is best analyzed from the perspective of a non-inertial reference frame that rotates with the turntable. In this frame, the insect is subject to not only real forces but also fictitious forces. The equation of motion for the insect of mass $m$ in this rotating frame is given by:\n$$m\\vec{a}_{\\text{rot}} = \\vec{F}_{\\text{real}} + \\vec{F}_{\\text{centrifugal}} + \\vec{F}_{\\text{Coriolis}}$$\nHere, $\\vec{a}_{\\text{rot}}$ is the acceleration of the insect as measured in the rotating frame, and $\\vec{F}_{\\text{real}}$ represents the sum of all real forces acting on the insect.\n\nLet's define a cylindrical coordinate system $(r, \\theta, z)$ co-rotating with the turntable. The origin is at the center of the turntable, and the $z$-axis is aligned with the axis of rotation, so the angular velocity vector is $\\vec{\\omega} = \\omega \\hat{k}$. The insect moves radially outward, so its velocity in the rotating frame is $\\vec{v}_{\\text{rot}} = v_r \\hat{r}$. Since the radial speed $v_r$ is constant, the insect's acceleration in the rotating frame is zero: $\\vec{a}_{\\text{rot}} = \\vec{0}$.\n\nThe real forces acting on the insect are gravity ($m\\vec{g} = -mg\\hat{k}$), the normal force from the turntable ($\\vec{N} = N\\hat{k}$), and the static friction force ($\\vec{f}_s$), which lies in the horizontal plane of the turntable. In the vertical direction, the forces are balanced, so $N = mg$. The friction force $\\vec{f}_s$ is the only real force in the horizontal plane.\n\nThe fictitious forces are:\n1.  The centrifugal force, $\\vec{F}_{\\text{centrifugal}} = -m\\vec{\\omega} \\times (\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{r}_{\\text{pos}})$. With the position vector $\\vec{r}_{\\text{pos}} = r\\hat{r}$, this becomes:\n    $$\\vec{F}_{\\text{centrifugal}} = -m(\\omega \\hat{k}) \\times ((\\omega \\hat{k}) \\times (r\\hat{r})) = -m(\\omega\\hat{k}) \\times (r\\omega \\hat{\\theta}) = -m(-r\\omega^2 \\hat{r}) = m\\omega^2 r \\hat{r}$$\n    This force is directed radially outward.\n\n2.  The Coriolis force, $\\vec{F}_{\\text{Coriolis}} = -2m(\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{v}_{\\text{rot}})$.\n    $$\\vec{F}_{\\text{Coriolis}} = -2m((\\omega\\hat{k}) \\times (v_r\\hat{r})) = -2m(\\omega v_r \\hat{\\theta})$$\n    This force is tangential, in the direction opposite to the turntable's rotation.\n\nNow, we substitute these terms into the equation of motion. We only need to consider the horizontal components, as the static friction force lies in the horizontal plane.\n$$m(\\vec{0}) = \\vec{f}_s + \\vec{F}_{\\text{centrifugal}} + \\vec{F}_{\\text{Coriolis}}$$\n$$ \\vec{0} = \\vec{f}_s + m\\omega^2 r \\hat{r} - 2m\\omega v_r \\hat{\\theta}$$\nTo maintain the described motion, the turntable must provide a static friction force $\\vec{f}_s$ that balances the sum of the fictitious forces:\n$$\\vec{f}_s = -m\\omega^2 r \\hat{r} + 2m\\omega v_r \\hat{\\theta}$$\nThis required friction force has a radial component (pointing inward) and a tangential component. The magnitude of the required static friction force, $F_{s, \\text{req}}$, is:\n$$F_{s, \\text{req}} = |\\vec{f}_s| = \\sqrt{(-m\\omega^2 r)^2 + (2m\\omega v_r)^2} = \\sqrt{m^2\\omega^4 r^2 + 4m^2\\omega^2 v_r^2}$$\n$$F_{s, \\text{req}} = m\\omega\\sqrt{\\omega^2 r^2 + 4v_r^2}$$\nThe insect will not slip as long as this required force is less than or equal to the maximum possible static friction force, $F_{s, \\text{max}}$. The maximum static friction is given by $F_{s, \\text{max}} = \\mu_s N = \\mu_s m g$.\n\nThe insect begins to slip at the radial distance $r$ where the required force equals the maximum available force:\n$$F_{s, \\text{req}} = F_{s, \\text{max}}$$\n$$m\\omega\\sqrt{\\omega^2 r^2 + 4v_r^2} = \\mu_s m g$$\nWe can cancel the mass $m$ from both sides and solve for $r$:\n$$\\omega\\sqrt{\\omega^2 r^2 + 4v_r^2} = \\mu_s g$$\nSquaring both sides of the equation gives:\n$$\\omega^2 (\\omega^2 r^2 + 4v_r^2) = \\mu_s^2 g^2$$\n$$\\omega^4 r^2 + 4\\omega^2 v_r^2 = \\mu_s^2 g^2$$\nNow, we isolate the term with $r^2$:\n$$\\omega^4 r^2 = \\mu_s^2 g^2 - 4\\omega^2 v_r^2$$\n$$r^2 = \\frac{\\mu_s^2 g^2 - 4\\omega^2 v_r^2}{\\omega^4}$$\nFinally, taking the square root gives the radial distance $r$ at which the insect slips:\n$$r = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\mu_s^2 g^2 - 4\\omega^2 v_r^2}}{\\omega^2}$$\nThis is the final expression for the slipping distance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{\\mu_s^{2} g^{2} - 4 v_r^{2} \\omega^{2}}}{\\omega^{2}}}$$", "id": "2191090"}, {"introduction": "Building on our understanding of the forces in a rotating frame, this final problem [@problem_id:2049582] explores a fully dynamic situation: the trajectory of a ball thrown vertically upwards on a rotating platform.
