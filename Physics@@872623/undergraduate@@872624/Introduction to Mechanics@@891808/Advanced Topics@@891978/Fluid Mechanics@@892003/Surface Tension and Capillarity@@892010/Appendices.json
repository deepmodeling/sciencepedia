This leads to some surprising effects, especially when bubbles interact. In this thought experiment [@problem_id:1796124], you will explore what happens when two soap bubbles of different sizes coalesce, applying the Young-Laplace equation to predict the curvature of the film that separates them and revealing why smaller bubbles possess higher internal pressure.", "problem": "Two spherical soap bubbles are created in a chamber where the external atmospheric pressure is $P_{atm}$ and the temperature is constant. The first bubble, Bubble A, has an initial radius of $R_A$. The second bubble, Bubble B, has an initial radius of $R_B$, with $R_B > R_A$. The soap solution has a uniform surface tension of $\\gamma$.\n\nThe two bubbles are gently brought into contact until they coalesce, forming a combined system with a shared, thin, spherical dividing film between them. Assuming the process occurs isothermally and the radii of the outer surfaces of Bubble A and Bubble B remain momentarily unchanged at $R_A$ and $R_B$ respectively, determine the radius of curvature, $R_{int}$, of this newly formed internal dividing film. Express your answer as a single symbolic expression in terms of $R_A$ and $R_B$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the radius of curvature of the shared film between two coalesced soap bubbles of different radii. The key principle to solve this problem is the Young-Laplace equation, which relates the pressure difference across a curved interface to its surface tension and radii of curvature.\n\nFor a spherical soap bubble in air, there are two surfaces (an inner and an outer surface) contributing to the pressure difference. The pressure inside the bubble, $P_{in}$, is greater than the pressure outside, $P_{out}$. The Young-Laplace equation for a spherical soap bubble of radius $R$ is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta P = P_{in} - P_{out} = \\frac{4\\gamma}{R}\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the surface tension of the soap film.\n\nLet's apply this equation to each bubble individually. The outside pressure for both bubbles is the ambient atmospheric pressure, $P_{atm}$.\n\nFor Bubble A with radius $R_A$, its internal pressure $P_A$ is:\n$$\nP_A = P_{atm} + \\frac{4\\gamma}{R_A}\n$$\n\nFor Bubble B with radius $R_B$, its internal pressure $P_B$ is:\n$$\nP_B = P_{atm} + \\frac{4\\gamma}{R_B}\n$$\n\nWhen the bubbles coalesce, they form a shared internal film. This film separates the air inside Bubble A (at pressure $P_A$) from the air inside Bubble B (at pressure $P_B$). The pressure difference across this dividing film is therefore $\\Delta P_{int} = P_A - P_B$.\n\nSince we are given that $R_B > R_A$, it follows that $\\frac{1}{R_A} > \\frac{1}{R_B}$. Consequently, $P_A > P_B$. This means the pressure inside the smaller bubble is greater than the pressure inside the larger bubble. As a result, the shared film will be curved, bulging into the region of lower pressure (Bubble B). Its center of curvature will therefore be located inside Bubble A.\n\nThe shared film is itself a soap film with two surfaces, so the Young-Laplace equation applies to it as well. Let the radius of curvature of this interface film be $R_{int}$. The pressure difference it sustains is related to its curvature by:\n$$\n\\Delta P_{int} = P_A - P_B = \\frac{4\\gamma}{R_{int}}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $P_A$ and $P_B$ into this equation:\n$$\n\\left( P_{atm} + \\frac{4\\gamma}{R_A} \\right) - \\left( P_{atm} + \\frac{4\\gamma}{R_B} \\right) = \\frac{4\\gamma}{R_{int}}\n$$\n\nThe atmospheric pressure terms $P_{atm}$ cancel out:\n$$\n\\frac{4\\gamma}{R_A} - \\frac{4\\gamma}{R_B} = \\frac{4\\gamma}{R_{int}}\n$$\n\nWe can divide the entire equation by the common factor of $4\\gamma$ (since $\\gamma \\neq 0$):\n$$\n\\frac{1}{R_A} - \\frac{1}{R_B} = \\frac{1}{R_{int}}\n$$\n\nTo solve for $R_{int}$, we first combine the terms on the left-hand side with a common denominator:\n$$\n\\frac{R_B - R_A}{R_A R_B} = \\frac{1}{R_{int}}\n$$\n\nFinally, we take the reciprocal of both sides to find the expression for $R_{int}$:\n$$\nR_{int} = \\frac{R_A R_B}{R_B - R_A}\n$$\nThis expression gives the radius of curvature of the internal dividing film.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{R_A R_B}{R_B - R_A}}$$", "id": "1796124"}, {"introduction": "The pressure difference across a curved meniscus is the driving force behind capillary action, the ability of a liquid to flow in narrow spaces against gravity.
