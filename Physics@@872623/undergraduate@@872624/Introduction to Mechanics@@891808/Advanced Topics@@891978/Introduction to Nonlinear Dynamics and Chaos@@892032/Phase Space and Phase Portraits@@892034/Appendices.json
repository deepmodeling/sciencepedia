This practice invites you to compare the phase portraits of an SHO and a simple pendulum, exploring how the pendulum's non-linear nature causes its trajectories to distort and its period to change with amplitude [@problem_id:2069988]. This comparative analysis is fundamental to understanding the rich behavior of non-linear dynamical systems.", "problem": "Consider two distinct one-dimensional oscillating systems.\n\nSystem 1 is a Simple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO), consisting of a mass $m$ attached to a horizontal spring with spring constant $k$. Its state is described by its position $x$ and momentum $p_x$.\n\nSystem 2 is a simple pendulum, consisting of a point mass $m$ attached to a massless rigid rod of length $L$, swinging in a uniform gravitational field $g$. Its state is described by the angular displacement from the vertical, $\\theta$, and its angular momentum, $p_\\theta$.\n\nThe parameters of the two systems are chosen such that their periods of oscillation for infinitesimally small amplitudes are identical. A phase portrait for an oscillator is a plot of its trajectories in its corresponding phase space, i.e., $(x, p_x)$ space for the SHO and $(\\theta, p_\\theta)$ space for the pendulum. Each closed trajectory in the phase portrait corresponds to a specific constant energy of the system.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate comparison of the phase portraits for these two systems as the amplitude of oscillation (and therefore the total energy) is increased beyond the small-angle regime?\n\nA. The phase portrait of the SHO consists of a family of concentric ellipses, where the period of revolution along any trajectory is constant, regardless of its size. For the pendulum, the trajectories are only elliptical for very small amplitudes and become distorted for larger amplitudes, with the period of revolution increasing as the trajectory size grows.\n\nB. The phase portraits of both systems consist of families of concentric ellipses. For the SHO, the trajectories are traversed at a constant rate. For the pendulum, the system moves slower along the trajectory as its angular displacement increases, but the overall period remains constant.\n\nC.
