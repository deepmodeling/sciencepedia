The ring is mounted at one end of the rod such that the rod is collinear with a diameter of the ring. The other end of the rod is attached to a fixed, frictionless pivot, allowing the entire assembly to move freely.\n\nThe system is set into motion with the rod held perfectly horizontal. The ring spins with a high, constant angular velocity $\\omega$ about the rod, which acts as the spin axis. Under the influence of gravity, characterized by the acceleration due to gravity $g$, the spinning system begins to precess about the vertical axis passing through the pivot.\n\nAssuming the spin angular velocity $\\omega$ is significantly larger than the resulting precession angular velocity, find an expression for the magnitude of the precession angular velocity, $\\Omega$.", "solution": "Step 1: Define a coordinate system and identify forces.\nLet's set up a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system with its origin at the fixed pivot point. Let the vertical direction be along the positive $z$-axis, so the gravitational force acts in the negative $z$-direction. Since the rod is horizontal, we can align it with the positive $x$-axis at a given moment in time.\n\nThe center of mass (CM) of the uniform ring is at its geometric center. Since the ring is mounted at the end of the rod of length $d$, the position vector of the CM of the ring with respect to the pivot is:\n$$ \\mathbf{r}_{\\text{cm}} = d \\mathbf{\\hat{i}} $$\nThe force of gravity acts on the total mass of the ring at its CM. This force is given by:\n$$ \\mathbf{F}_g = -Mg \\mathbf{\\hat{k}} $$\n\nStep 2: Calculate the torque on the system.\nThe torque $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ about the pivot point is calculated as the cross product of the position vector of the CM and the gravitational force acting on it.\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{r}_{\\text{cm}} \\times \\mathbf{F}_g $$\nSubstituting the expressions from Step 1:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = (d \\mathbf{\\hat{i}}) \\times (-Mg \\mathbf{\\hat{k}}) = -Mgd (\\mathbf{\\hat{i}} \\times \\mathbf{\\hat{k}}) $$\nUsing the property of the cross product for unit vectors, $\\mathbf{\\hat{i}} \\times \\mathbf{\\hat{k}} = -\\mathbf{\\hat{j}}$, we get:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = -Mgd (-\\mathbf{\\hat{j}}) = Mgd \\mathbf{\\hat{j}} $$\nThe torque has a magnitude of $Mgd$ and points in the positive $y$-direction, which is horizontal and perpendicular to the rod.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the spin angular momentum.\nThe ring is spinning with angular velocity $\\omega$ about the rod, which is aligned with the $x$-axis. So, the spin angular velocity vector is:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{s} = \\omega \\mathbf{\\hat{i}} $$\nThe spin angular momentum $\\mathbf{L}_s$ is the product of the moment of inertia of the ring about the spin axis and the spin angular velocity vector.\n$$ \\mathbf{L}_s = I_{\\text{spin}} \\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{s} $$\nThe spin axis is a diameter of the ring. The moment of inertia of a thin ring of mass $M$ and radius $R$ about one of its diameters is $I_{\\text{spin}} = \\frac{1}{2}MR^2$.\nTherefore, the spin angular momentum is:\n$$ \\mathbf{L}_s = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}MR^2\\right) (\\omega \\mathbf{\\hat{i}}) = \\frac{1}{2}MR^2\\omega \\mathbf{\\hat{i}} $$\n\nStep 4: Apply the gyroscopic precession equation.\nFor a gyroscope where the spin angular velocity $\\omega$ is much larger than the precession angular velocity $\\Omega$, the total angular momentum is dominated by the spin component, so we can approximate $\\mathbf{L} \\approx \\mathbf{L}_s$. The fundamental equation relating torque, precession, and angular momentum is:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\boldsymbol{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{L}_s $$\nThe precession occurs about the vertical axis (the $z$-axis). So, the precession angular velocity vector is $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} = \\Omega \\mathbf{\\hat{k}}$.

The axle is supported by a frictionless pivot at its exact center, and is initially held in a horizontal orientation. The two disks are spun up to the same high angular speed $\\omega$, but in opposite directions with respect to the axle's longitudinal axis.

The axle will precess about the vertical axis, but with the end carrying the mass $m$ tilted slightly upwards relative to the horizontal plane.\n\nE. The axle will nutate, meaning it will oscillate up and down in the vertical plane while simultaneously precessing.", "solution": "Let's analyze the physical system by defining a coordinate system and calculating the relevant vector quantities: the total angular momentum and the external torque.\n\nFirst, let's set up a coordinate system. Let the pivot be at the origin $(0,0,0)$. We can align the axle initially along the x-axis, so it extends from $x = -d$ to $x = +d$. Let the vertical direction be the z-axis, so gravity acts in the $-z$ direction.\n\nThe total angular momentum of the system is the vector sum of the angular momenta of the two spinning disks. The angular momentum of a rigid body spinning about an axis of symmetry is given by $\\mathbf{L} = I\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia and $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ is the angular velocity vector. For a uniform solid disk of mass $M$ and radius $R$ spinning about its central axis, the moment of inertia is $I = \\frac{1}{2}MR^2$.\n\nLet's assume the disk at the positive end of the axle ($x=+d$) has an angular velocity vector $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_1 = \\omega \\mathbf{\\hat{i}}$. This corresponds to a spin in one direction along the x-axis. Since the other disk (at $x=-d$) spins in the opposite direction, its angular velocity vector must be $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_2 = -\\omega \\mathbf{\\hat{i}}$.\n\nThe angular momentum of the first disk (at $x=+d$) is:\n$$ \\mathbf{L}_1 = I \\boldsymbol{\\omega}_1 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} MR^2\\right) (\\omega \\mathbf{\\hat{i}}) = \\frac{1}{2} MR^2 \\omega \\mathbf{\\hat{i}} $$\n\nThe angular momentum of the second disk (at $x=-d$) is:\n$$ \\mathbf{L}_2 = I \\boldsymbol{\\omega}_2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} MR^2\\right) (-\\omega \\mathbf{\\hat{i}}) = -\\frac{1}{2} MR^2 \\omega \\mathbf{\\hat{i}} $$\n\nThe total spin angular momentum of the system, $\\mathbf{L}_{S}$, is the vector sum of the individual angular momenta:\n$$ \\mathbf{L}_{S} = \\mathbf{L}_1 + \\mathbf{L}_2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} MR^2 \\omega \\mathbf{\\hat{i}}\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} MR^2 \\omega \\mathbf{\\hat{i}}\\right) = \\mathbf{0} $$\nThe total spin angular momentum of the two-disk system is zero. This is the critical insight for this problem. Gyroscopic effects like precession arise from the system having a large, non-zero initial angular momentum.\n\nNext, let's calculate the external torque on the system about the pivot. When the small mass $m$ is attached at one end, say at the position $\\mathbf{r} = d \\mathbf{\\hat{i}}$, it experiences a gravitational force $\\mathbf{F}_g = -mg \\mathbf{\\hat{k}}$. The torque, $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$, produced by this force about the pivot (the origin) is given by the cross product $\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{F}_g$.\n\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = (d \\mathbf{\\hat{i}}) \\times (-mg \\mathbf{\\hat{k}}) = -mgd (\\mathbf{\\hat{i}} \\times \\mathbf{\\hat{k}}) $$\nUsing the right-hand rule for the cross product of unit vectors, we know that $\\mathbf{\\hat{i}} \\times \\mathbf{\\hat{k}} = -\\mathbf{\\hat{j}}$. Substituting this in:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = -mgd (-\\mathbf{\\hat{j}}) = mgd \\mathbf{\\hat{j}} $$\nSo, there is a net external torque on the system pointing in the positive y-direction.\n\nThe fundamental equation of rotational dynamics states that the net external torque is equal to the rate of change of the total angular momentum:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{L}_{\\text{total}}}{dt} $$\nIn this problem, the total initial angular momentum is zero (since $\\mathbf{L}_S = \\mathbf{0}$ and there is no initial orbital angular momentum of the axle itself). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n$$ mgd \\mathbf{\\hat{j}} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{L}_{\\text{total}}}{dt} $$\nThis equation tells us that the total angular momentum of the system will begin to change, starting from zero, in the direction of the torque. An angular momentum vector pointing in the $\\mathbf{\\hat{j}}$ direction corresponds to a rotation about the y-axis. A rotation about the y-axis would cause the part of the axle on the positive x-axis (where the mass is) to rotate towards the negative z-axis.\n\nIn simpler terms, the torque causes an angular acceleration about the y-axis. The system behaves as if the disks were not spinning at all, because their gyroscopic effects perfectly cancel each other out. The axle and the attached mass will simply act like a simple lever or a seesaw with weight on one side, pivoted at the center. The end with the mass $m$ will rotate downwards in the vertical (x-z) plane.\n\nLet's review the options:\nA. Precession requires a non-zero initial spin angular momentum. Since $\\mathbf{L}_S = \\mathbf{0}$, this is incorrect.\nB. There is a non-zero external torque from the weight, so the system cannot remain stationary. This is incorrect.\nC. The net torque causes an angular acceleration, resulting in rotation in a vertical plane, with the weighted end dropping. This matches our analysis.\nD. This option describes a form of precession, which is not occurring. This is incorrect.\nE. Nutation is typically a small oscillation superimposed on precession. Since there is no precession, this is incorrect. The system will not oscillate back up without a restoring torque.\n\nTherefore, the correct description of the motion is that the end of the axle with the attached mass simply rotates downwards.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2195028"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basic principles of precession, this problem introduces an additional layer of complexity by placing the system in a non-inertial reference frame. We will analyze a spinning top on the floor of an elevator that is accelerating upwards [@problem_id:2194995].

The moment of inertia of the top about its symmetry axis is $I_s$. The top is placed on the horizontal floor of an elevator, with its tip remaining at a fixed point on the floor. It is set to spin with a large constant angular velocity $\\omega_s$ about its symmetry axis. The symmetry axis is observed to maintain a constant angle $\\theta$ with respect to the vertical direction as it precesses around the vertical axis. The entire elevator is accelerating vertically upwards with a constant acceleration of magnitude $a$. Let $g$ be the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nAssuming that the spin angular velocity is much greater than the angular velocity of precession ($\\omega_s \\gg \\Omega_p$), determine an expression for the angular frequency of precession, $\\Omega_p$. Express your answer in terms of $M, d, g, a, I_s$, and $\\omega_s$.", "solution": "We begin by analyzing the forces and torques on the top. It is convenient to work in the non-inertial reference frame of the elevator. In this frame, in addition to the real forces, we must include a fictitious inertial force.\n\nThe real forces acting on the top are the force of gravity, $\\mathbf{F}_g$, acting downwards at the center of mass, and the contact force from the floor, $\\mathbf{N}$, acting at the tip. The inertial force due to the elevator's upward acceleration $\\mathbf{a}$ is $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{in}} = -M\\mathbf{a}$, which also acts downwards at the center of mass.\n\nThe net effective gravitational force in the elevator's frame is the sum of the true gravitational force and the inertial force:\n$$ \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{eff}} = \\mathbf{F}_g + \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{in}} $$\nSince both forces are directed vertically downwards, the magnitude of this effective force is:\n$$ F_{\\text{eff}} = M g + M a = M(g+a) $$\nThis is equivalent to analyzing the problem in an inertial frame with an effective gravitational acceleration $g_{\\text{eff}} = g+a$.\n\nNext, we calculate the torque $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ about the fixed pivot point (the tip of the top). The contact force $\\mathbf{N}$ acts at the pivot and thus produces zero torque. The only force that produces a torque is the effective gravitational force $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{eff}}$ acting on the center of mass.\nThe vector from the pivot to the center of mass is $\\mathbf{r}$. Its magnitude is $|\\mathbf{r}| = d$. The angle between $\\mathbf{r}$ (which is along the top's symmetry axis) and the direction of $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{eff}}$ (which is vertically downwards) is $\\theta$.\nThe torque is given by $\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{eff}}$.

The problem states that the spin angular velocity $\\omega_s$ is much larger than the precessional angular velocity $\\Omega_p$. This allows us to neglect the contribution of the precessional motion to the angular momentum and approximate it as:\n$$ \\mathbf{L} \\approx \\mathbf{L}_{\\text{spin}} $$\nThe magnitude of the spin angular momentum is given by:\n$$ L \\approx I_s \\omega_s $$\nThe direction of $\\mathbf{L}$ is along the symmetry axis of the top.\n\nThe fundamental equation of rotational dynamics relates the torque to the rate of change of angular momentum:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{L}}{dt} $$\nThis equation implies that the change in the angular momentum vector, $d\\mathbf{L}$, over a small time interval $dt$ is in the same direction as the torque vector $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$. Since $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ is always perpendicular to $\\mathbf{L}$, the torque does not change the magnitude of $\\mathbf{L}$ but only its direction. This change in direction is the phenomenon of precession.\n\nThe vector $\\mathbf{L}$ rotates about the vertical axis. The tip of the vector $\\mathbf{L}$ sweeps out a horizontal circle. The radius of this circle is the horizontal component of $\\mathbf{L}$, which is $L_{\\perp} = L \\sin\\theta$.\nIn a small time interval $dt$, the angular momentum vector rotates by an angle $d\\phi$ about the vertical. The magnitude of the change in the vector, $|d\\mathbf{L}|$, is the arc length traced by the tip of $\\mathbf{L}$, which is given by:\n$$ |d\\mathbf{L}| = (L \\sin\\theta) d\\phi $$\nFrom the equation of motion, we also have $|d\\mathbf{L}| = \\tau dt$.
