The satellite's main body is a solid, uniform rectangular block of aluminum with mass $M$ and side lengths $a = 0.20$ m, $b = 0.30$ m, and $c = 0.40$ m. The principal axes of the satellite, which pass through its center of mass, are aligned with its edges.

This is a classic demonstration of the Tennis Racket Theorem.\n\nFirst, we must identify the principal axes and their corresponding moments of inertia for the uniform rectangular block. The principal axes pass through the center of mass and are aligned with the edges of lengths $a, b,$ and $c$. Let the moments of inertia about these axes be $I_a, I_b$, and $I_c$, respectively. For a uniform rectangular block of mass $M$ and dimensions $(a,b,c)$, the principal moments of inertia are given by:\n$$I_a = \\frac{M}{12}(b^2 + c^2)$$\n$$I_b = \\frac{M}{12}(a^2 + c^2)$$\n$$I_c = \\frac{M}{12}(a^2 + b^2)$$\n\nNext, we substitute the given side lengths $a = 0.20$ m, $b = 0.30$ m, and $c = 0.40$ m to determine the relative order of the moments of inertia. The common factor of $M/12$ can be ignored for comparison.\n$$I_a \\propto (0.30)^2 + (0.40)^2 = 0.09 + 0.16 = 0.25$$\n$$I_b \\propto (0.20)^2 + (0.40)^2 = 0.04 + 0.16 = 0.20$$\n$$I_c \\propto (0.20)^2 + (0.30)^2 = 0.04 + 0.09 = 0.13$$\nBy comparing these values, we have the ordering $I_c  I_b  I_a$. Therefore, the axis $\\hat{e}_b$ corresponds to the intermediate principal moment of inertia, $I_b$. The axes $\\hat{e}_c$ and $\\hat{e}_a$ correspond to the minimum ($I_1 = I_c$) and maximum ($I_3 = I_a$) moments of inertia, respectively. So we have $I_1 = I_c$, $I_2 = I_b$, $I_3 = I_a$.\n\nThe problem states that the block is spun primarily about the intermediate axis, $\\hat{e}_b$. Let the angular velocity vector in the body-fixed frame of principal axes be $\\vec{\\omega} = (\\omega_c, \\omega_b, \\omega_a)$. The initial condition is that $\\omega_b \\approx \\omega_0$ and $\\omega_c, \\omega_a$ are small perturbations. Euler's equations for a rigid body are:\n$$I_c \\dot{\\omega}_c = (I_b - I_a) \\omega_b \\omega_a$$\n$$I_b \\dot{\\omega}_b = (I_a - I_c) \\omega_a \\omega_c$$\n$$I_a \\dot{\\omega}_a = (I_c - I_b) \\omega_c \\omega_b$$\n\nSince $\\omega_c$ and $\\omega_a$ are small, their product $\\omega_a \\omega_c$ is a second-order small quantity. Thus, the second equation gives $I_b \\dot{\\omega}_b \\approx 0$, which implies that the main component of angular velocity, $\\omega_b$, is approximately constant: $\\omega_b(t) \\approx \\omega_0$.\n\nWe can now linearize the first and third equations for the small perturbations $\\omega_c$ and $\\omega_a$:\n$$ \\dot{\\omega}_c = \\frac{I_b - I_a}{I_c} \\omega_0 \\omega_a $$\n$$ \\dot{\\omega}_a = \\frac{I_c - I_b}{I_a} \\omega_0 \\omega_c $$\n\nThis is a system of two coupled first-order linear differential equations. To solve it, we can differentiate the first equation with respect to time:\n$$ \\ddot{\\omega}_c = \\frac{I_b - I_a}{I_c} \\omega_0 \\dot{\\omega}_a $$\nNow, substitute the expression for $\\dot{\\omega}_a$ from the second equation into this:\n$$ \\ddot{\\omega}_c = \\frac{I_b - I_a}{I_c} \\omega_0 \\left( \\frac{I_c - I_b}{I_a} \\omega_0 \\omega_c \\right) $$\n$$ \\ddot{\\omega}_c = \\left[ \\frac{(I_b - I_a)(I_c - I_b)}{I_c I_a} \\omega_0^2 \\right] \\omega_c $$\nThis is a second-order linear differential equation of the form $\\ddot{x} = k x$. The solution is exponential if the constant $k$ is positive. Let's check the sign of the term in the brackets. Since $I_c  I_b  I_a$, the term $(I_b - I_a)$ is negative, and the term $(I_c - I_b)$ is also negative. Their product is positive. Thus, the coefficient of $\\omega_c$ is positive, leading to exponential growth.\n\nThe equation is of the form $\\ddot{\\omega}_c = \\lambda^2 \\omega_c$, where $\\lambda$ is the exponential growth rate. By comparison, we have:\n$$ \\lambda^2 = \\frac{(I_b - I_a)(I_c - I_b)}{I_c I_a} \\omega_0^2 = \\frac{(I_a - I_b)(I_b - I_c)}{I_c I_a} \\omega_0^2 $$\nTaking the positive square root for the growth rate:\n$$ \\lambda = \\omega_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{(I_a - I_b)(I_b - I_c)}{I_c I_a}} $$\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for the moments of inertia. The factor of $M/12$ will cancel out.\n$$ I_a - I_b = \\frac{M}{12}((b^2+c^2) - (a^2+c^2)) = \\frac{M}{12}(b^2 - a^2) $$\n$$ I_b - I_c = \\frac{M}{12}((a^2+c^2) - (a^2+b^2)) = \\frac{M}{12}(c^2 - b^2) $$\n$$ I_c I_a = \\left(\\frac{M}{12}\\right)^2 (a^2+b^2)(b^2+c^2) $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda = \\omega_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\left(\\frac{M}{12}(b^2 - a^2)\\right) \\left(\\frac{M}{12}(c^2 - b^2)\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{M}{12}\\right)^2 (a^2+b^2)(b^2+c^2)}} = \\omega_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{(b^2 - a^2)(c^2 - b^2)}{(a^2 + b^2)(b^2 + c^2)}} $$\n\nFinally, we substitute the numerical values: $a=0.20$ m, $b=0.30$ m, $c=0.40$ m, and $\\omega_0=10.0$ rad/s.\n$$ a^2 = 0.04 \\text{ m}^2 $$\n$$ b^2 = 0.09 \\text{ m}^2 $$\n$$ c^2 = 0.16 \\text{ m}^2 $$\nThe terms in the expression for $\\lambda$ are:\n$$ b^2 - a^2 = 0.09 - 0.04 = 0.05 \\text{ m}^2 $$\n$$ c^2 - b^2 = 0.16 - 0.09 = 0.07 \\text{ m}^2 $$\n$$ a^2 + b^2 = 0.04 + 0.09 = 0.13 \\text{ m}^2 $$\n$$ b^2 + c^2 = 0.09 + 0.16 = 0.25 \\text{ m}^2 $$\nNow we can calculate $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda = 10.0 \\text{ rad/s} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{(0.05)(0.07)}{(0.13)(0.25)}} $$\n$$ \\lambda = 10.0 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{0.0035}{0.0325}} $$\n$$ \\lambda = 10.0 \\times \\sqrt{0.1076923...} $$\n$$ \\lambda = 10.0 \\times 0.328165... \\text{ s}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\lambda = 3.28165... \\text{ s}^{-1} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $\\lambda = 3.28$ s$^{-1}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.28}$$", "id": "2225193"}, {"introduction": "The most powerful way to build intuition for a physical phenomenon is to see it in action.

The function $f$ is defined by the right-hand sides of Euler's equations.\n\nThe core of the solution is a numerical initial value problem (IVP) solver. The `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` function from the SciPy library is an excellent choice, providing access to robust, adaptive-stepsize algorithms like the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method (`RK45`). For each test case, we will define a function that evaluates the time derivatives of $\\vec{\\omega}$ given the current state $\\vec{\\omega}$ and the moments of inertia $\\vec{I} = [I_1, I_2, I_3]$.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Initialize the parameters for the specific test: moments of inertia $\\vec{I}=(I_1, I_2, I_3)$ and initial angular velocity $\\vec{\\omega}_0 = (\\omega_1(0), \\omega_2(0), \\omega_3(0))$.\n2.  Define the integration time span as $[0, T]$ with $T=1$.\n3.

The small initial perturbation is expected to grow exponentially, yielding a growth factor $R_A \\gg 1$.\n\nTests B and C examine rotation about the minimum ($I_1$) and maximum ($I_3$) inertia axes, which are stable equilibria. Any small initial perturbation should result in bounded oscillations, not exponential growth. The final perturbation magnitudes, $R_B$ and $R_C$, should remain small, on the order of the initial perturbation.\n\nTest D deals with a spherical top ($I_1 = I_2 = I_3$). The right-hand sides of Euler's equations become identically zero, implying that $\\frac{d\\vec{\\omega}}{dt} = \\vec{0}$. The angular velocity vector must remain constant. The computed deviation $\\Delta_D$ should be effectively zero, limited only by the numerical precision of the algorithm.\n\nTest E presents an ideal case of rotation exactly about the unstable intermediate axis, with no initial perturbation. Theoretically, the system is in equilibrium, so $\\vec{\\omega}$ should not change. $\\Delta_E$ should therefore be close to zero, testing the solver's ability to handle an unstable fixed point without introducing numerical noise that would trigger the instability demonstrated in Test A.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Formulates, implements, and executes a numerical solver for the\n    torque-free rigid-body rotation to demonstrate the Dzhanibekov effect.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def euler_ode(t, omega, I1, I2, I3):\n        \"\"\"\n        Defines the system of Euler's equations for a rigid body.\n        \n        Args:\n            t (float): Time (required by solve_ivp, but not used in the equations).\n            omega (np.ndarray): Array of angular velocities [w1, w2, w3].\n            I1, I2, I3 (float): Principal moments of inertia.\n            \n        Returns:\n            list: The time derivatives [dw1/dt, dw2/dt, dw3/dt].\n        \"\"\"\n        w1, w2, w3 = omega\n        \n        dw1_dt = (I2 - I3) / I1 * w2 * w3\n        dw2_dt = (I3 - I1) / I2 * w3 * w1\n        dw3_dt = (I1 - I2) / I3 * w1 * w2\n        \n        return [dw1_dt, dw2_dt, dw3_dt]\n\n    # Final integration time\n    T_FINAL = 1.0\n    t_span = [0, T_FINAL]\n    t_eval = [T_FINAL]\n    \n    # Define the 5 test cases from the problem statement\n    test_cases = [\n        {'id': 'A', 'I': (1.0, 2.0, 3.0), 'omega0': (0.0, 10.0, 1e-4)},\n        {'id': 'B', 'I': (1.0, 2.0, 3.0), 'omega0': (10.0, 1e-4, 0.0)},\n        {'id': 'C', 'I': (1.0, 2.0, 3.0), 'omega0': (1e-4, 0.0, 10.0)},\n        {'id': 'D', 'I': (2.0, 2.0, 2.0), 'omega0': (3.0, -4.0, 5.0)},\n        {'id': 'E', 'I': (1.0, 2.0, 3.0), 'omega0': (0.0, 10.0, 0.0)},\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        I_params = case['I']\n        omega0_vec = np.array(case['omega0'])\n\n        # Solve the initial value problem with high precision\n        sol = solve_ivp(\n            fun=euler_ode,\n            t_span=t_span,\n            y0=omega0_vec,\n            method='RK45',\n            t_eval=t_eval,\n            args=I_params,\n            rtol=1e-12,\n            atol=1e-12\n        )\n        \n        omega_T = sol.y[:, -1]\n        \n        if case['id'] == 'A':\n            # Compute growth factor R_A\n            w1_T, w2_T, w3_T = omega_T\n            w1_0, w2_0, w3_0 = omega0_vec\n            \n            initial_perturbation = np.sqrt(w1_0**2 + w3_0**2)\n            final_perturbation = np.sqrt(w1_T**2 + w3_T**2)\n            result = final_perturbation / initial_perturbation\n            \n        elif case['id'] == 'B':\n            # Compute R_B\n            w1_T, w2_T, w3_T = omega_T\n            result = np.sqrt(w2_T**2 + w3_T**2)\n            \n        elif case['id'] == 'C':\n            # Compute R_C\n            w1_T, w2_T, w3_T = omega_T\n            result = np.sqrt(w1_T**2 + w2_T**2)\n            \n        elif case['id'] == 'D' or case['id'] == 'E':\n            # Compute max absolute component-wise deviation Delta\n            deviation = np.abs(omega_T - omega0_vec)\n            result = np.max(deviation)\n            \n        results.append(result)\n\n    # Print the results in the specified format\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2444871"}]}
