Since the bead starts from rest at $y=0$, the initial kinetic and potential energies are zero (taking the potential energy reference $U(0)=0$). At a vertical position $y$, the potential energy is $U(y) = -mgy$ and the kinetic energy is $K(y) = \\frac{1}{2}mv(y)^2$.\nConservation of energy, $K(y) + U(y) = 0$, gives $\\frac{1}{2}mv(y)^2 - mgy = 0$, which simplifies to $v(y) = \\sqrt{2gy}$.\n\nThe total time of travel is the integral of $dt = ds/v$:\n$$T[y] = \\int \\frac{ds}{v} = \\int \\frac{\\sqrt{1+(y')^2}}{\\sqrt{2gy}} dx$$\nThe total length of the wire is:\n$$L[y] = \\int ds = \\int \\sqrt{1+(y')^2} dx$$\nTo solve this constrained optimization problem, we use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem from computational physics that can be solved using the specified numerical methods.\n\n---\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins with the two equations defining the terminal point $(X, -Y)$:\n$$\nX = R(\\phi - \\sin\\phi) \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\nY = R(1 - \\cos\\phi) \\quad (2)\n$$\nFor $Y>0$ and $\\phi \\in (0, 2\\pi)$, the term $(1 - \\cos\\phi)$ is strictly positive. We can therefore solve equation $(2)$ for the radius parameter $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{Y}{1 - \\cos\\phi}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $R$ into equation $(1)$ eliminates the radius parameter:\n$$\nX = \\left(\\frac{Y}{1 - \\cos\\phi}\\right)(\\phi - \\sin\\phi)\n$$\nIntroducing the specified constant $k = X/Y$, we arrive at a single transcendental equation for the angle $\\phi$:\n$$\nk = \\frac{\\phi - \\sin\\phi}{1 - \\cos\\phi}\n$$\nTo solve this equation using fixed-point iteration as required, we rearrange it into the form $\\phi = g(\\phi; k)$:\n$$\nk(1 - \\cos\\phi) = \\phi - \\sin\\phi \\implies \\phi = \\sin\\phi + k(1 - \\cos\\phi)\n$$\nThis defines the fixed-point mapping function:\n$$\ng(\\phi; k) = \\sin\\phi + k(1 - \\cos\\phi)\n$$\nThe problem requires a relaxed fixed-point iteration with a relaxation parameter $\\lambda = 1/2$. The iteration function, which we shall denote as $G(\\phi)$, is:\n$$\nG(\\phi; k) = (1 - \\lambda)\\phi + \\lambda g(\\phi; k) = \\frac{1}{2}\\phi + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sin\\phi + k(1 - \\cos\\phi)\\right)\n$$\nTo accelerate convergence, the problem specifies the use of Aitken's $\\Delta^2$ formula applied to the sequence of iterates $\\{\\phi_n\\}$ generated by $G(\\phi; k)$. The formula is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\phi}_n = \\phi_n - \\frac{(\\phi_{n+1}-\\phi_n)^2}{\\phi_{n+2} - 2\\phi_{n+1} + \\phi_n}\n$$\nwhere $\\phi_{n+1} = G(\\phi_n; k)$ and $\\phi_{n+2} = G(\\phi_{n+1}; k)$. Applying this transformation at every step of the iteration is known as Steffensen's method. The update rule for the sequence becomes:\n$$\n\\phi_{n+1} = \\phi_n - \\frac{(G(\\phi_n; k) - \\phi_n)^2}{G(G(\\phi_n; k); k) - 2G(\\phi_n; k) + \\phi_n}\n$$\nThis method typically provides quadratic convergence. The implementation requires an initial guess, $\\phi_0$. A value of $\\phi_0 = \\pi$ is chosen as a robust starting point, being central to the valid domain $(0, 2\\pi)$.\n\nThe iteration proceeds until the following two conditions are met for a tolerance $\\tau = 10^{-12}$:\n1.  The magnitude of the change between successive iterates is sufficiently small: $|\\phi_{n+1} - \\phi_n| \\le \\tau$.\n2.  The residual of the original fixed-point equation at the new iterate is also small: $|\\phi_{n+1} - g(\\phi_{n+1}; k)| \\le \\tau$. This second condition verifies that the computed solution is indeed a high-quality fixed point of the original problem.\n\nIf the denominator in the Steffensen's formula approaches zero, a fallback to a single step of the un-accelerated relaxed iteration, $\\phi_{n+1} = G(\\phi_n; k)$, is performed to maintain numerical stability. Once a sufficiently accurate value of $\\phi$ is found, the radius $R$ is computed using $R = Y / (1 - \\cos\\phi)$.
