This practice challenges you to think critically about the nature of hysteresis by devising a procedure to reliably demagnetize a component.

The goal is to implement a procedure that reliably brings the net magnetization, $M$, of the steel component to zero.\n\nAssume the steel component is initially at rest with a large remanent magnetization and is placed inside the solenoid. The coercivity of the steel is denoted by $H_c$. Which of the following procedures, using the solenoid, is the correct and most effective method for demagnetizing the component?\n\nA.

Apply an AC magnetic field with a constant peak amplitude $H_{peak}$ that is much greater than the coercivity $H_c$. After several hundred cycles, abruptly turn off the field when the AC current crosses zero.", "solution": "We use the ferromagnetic hysteresis behavior relating the magnetic field $H$ and magnetization $M$. For a ferromagnet, the constitutive relation is $B=\\mu_{0}(H+M)$, and $M$ depends on the history of $H$. The hysteresis loop has a remanent magnetization $M_{r}$ at $H=0$ and a coercivity $H_{c}$, the magnitude of $H$ required to reduce $M$ to zero from saturation.\n\nThe objective is to reach a final state at $H=0$ with $M=0$. Because of hysteresis, simply making $M=0$ at nonzero $H$ does not guarantee $M=0$ after $H$ is removed. The standard demagnetization (degaussing) method uses an alternating field whose amplitude is gradually reduced to zero so that the system executes a sequence of symmetric minor hysteresis loops shrinking to the origin. The theoretical justification is:\n- If one applies an AC field $H(t)$ with peak amplitude $H_{a}\\gg H_{c}$, the magnetization is driven to both positive and negative saturation, erasing prior bias and placing the system on a symmetric major loop.\n- Then, if the peak amplitude $H_{a}$ is reduced slowly (adiabatically with respect to the domain dynamics) to zero, the system traces a family of symmetric minor loops $M(H;H_{a})$ parameterized by $H_{a}$. By symmetry of these loops, $M(0;H_{a})=0$, and in the limit $H_{a}\\to 0$ the loop shrinks to the point $(H,M)=(0,0)$, thus achieving $M=0$ at $H=0$.\n- The requirement $H_{a}\\gtrsim H_{c}$ initially ensures that the loop spans both coercive points so that any initial remanent magnetization is removed.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n\nA. An AC field with fixed peak $H_{\\text{peak}}\\ll H_{c}$ only drives the material within a small minor loop around the initial biased state. The loop does not cross both coercive points, so the bias is not erased. Abruptly turning off the field leaves a remanent $M$ close to the initial $M_{r}$, not $M=0$. Therefore A is ineffective.\n\nB. A DC field of magnitude $H_{c}$ opposite to the initial magnetization can make $M=0$ while the field is applied, but upon reducing $H$ back to zero, the system follows the hysteresis branch and returns to a nonzero remanent $M_{r}$. Therefore B does not produce $M=0$ at $H=0$.\n\nC. An AC field with initial $H_{\\text{peak}}\\gg H_{c}$ followed by a slow, continuous decrease of the peak amplitude ensures traversal of the major loop and then a sequence of shrinking symmetric minor loops. In the limit that the amplitude goes to zero, the endpoint is $M=0$ at $H=0$. This is the standard degaussing method and is correct and most effective.\n\nD. An AC field with large constant amplitude produces repeated saturation, but an abrupt turn-off at a zero crossing of current (hence $H=0$ at that instant) still leaves the magnetization at the remanent value $M_{r}$ corresponding to the last branch of the loop, not $M=0$. Thus D fails to demagnetize.\n\nTherefore, the correct and most effective procedure is the AC field with slowly decreasing amplitude from an initial value exceeding the coercivity, i.e., option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1580851"}]}
