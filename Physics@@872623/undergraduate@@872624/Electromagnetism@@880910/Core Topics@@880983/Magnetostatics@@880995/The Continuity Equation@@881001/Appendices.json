When left in open air, the material interacts with ambient ions, causing the total charge enclosed within the sphere, $Q_{\\text{enc}}(t)$, to change over time. Experimental measurements show that $Q_{\\text{enc}}(t)$ decreases at a perfectly constant rate. This constant rate of decrease is denoted by the positive value $C$, which has units of coulombs per second.

This advanced problem [@problem_id:1609781] combines the continuity equation with Gauss's law and material properties to solve a practical design constraint. By working through this exercise, you will see how the condition for a steady current in a medium with no free charge accumulation imposes a specific relationship between the material's conductivity $\\sigma$ and its permittivity $\\epsilon$.", "problem": "A long coaxial cable consists of two concentric cylindrical conductors of radii $a$ and $b$ ($a < b$) and length $L$, where $L \\gg b$. The space between the conductors is filled with an inhomogeneous, isotropic, \"leaky\" dielectric material. The material's electrical properties vary only with the radial distance $s$ from the central axis. Its permittivity is given by the function $\\epsilon(s) = \\frac{\\kappa}{s}$, where $\\kappa$ is a positive constant with units of farads (F). The material also has a position-dependent conductivity, $\\sigma(s)$.\n\nA constant potential difference is maintained between the two conductors, which drives a steady leakage current radially outward from the inner conductor to the outer conductor. Under these steady-state conditions, it is observed that no net free volume charge density develops within the dielectric material for $a < s < b$.\n\nDetermine the functional form that the conductivity $\\sigma(s)$ must have for this condition to be met. Express your answer as an analytic function of the radial coordinate $s$ and a single arbitrary constant of proportionality, $C$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the form of the conductivity $\\sigma(s)$ that ensures no free volume charge density exists in the dielectric of a cylindrical capacitor under steady-state current conditions.\n\nLet the free volume charge density be $\\rho(s)$ and the current density be $\\mathbf{J}(s)$.\nThe condition that \"no net free volume charge density develops\" is mathematically stated as $\\rho(s) = 0$ for all $s$ in the range $a < s < b$.\n\nAccording to Gauss's law for dielectrics, the free charge density is related to the divergence of the electric displacement field $\\mathbf{D}$:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D} = \\rho $$\nSince $\\rho = 0$, we must have:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D} = 0 $$\nBy the cylindrical symmetry of the problem, the electric displacement field must be purely radial, i.e., $\\mathbf{D}(s) = D(s)\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}$. In cylindrical coordinates, the divergence operator acting on such a field is $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D} = \\frac{1}{s}\\frac{d}{ds}(s D(s))$.\nSo, the condition becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{s}\\frac{d}{ds}(s D(s)) = 0 $$\nThis implies that the quantity $s D(s)$ must be a constant.

In electrodynamics, a steady current is one for which the charge density at any point does not change with time, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = 0$. The continuity equation relates the divergence of the current density to the rate of change of charge density:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} + \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = 0 $$\nGiven that the current is steady, $\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = 0$, which implies:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} = 0 $$\nLike the displacement field, the current density $\\mathbf{J}$ must also be purely radial due to symmetry: $\\mathbf{J}(s) = J(s)\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}$. Applying the divergence operator in cylindrical coordinates gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{s}\\frac{d}{ds}(s J(s)) = 0 $$\nThis implies that $s J(s)$ is also a constant.

The ratio $\\sigma(s)/\\varepsilon(s)$ must be constant.\n\nThe problem specifies the form of the permittivity as $\\epsilon(s) = \\frac{\\kappa}{s}$. We can substitute this into our result:\n$$ \\sigma(s) = \\frac{C_2}{C_1} \\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{s}\\right) $$\nThe constants $C_1$, $C_2$, and $\\kappa$ are all fixed for a given physical situation. We can combine them into a single arbitrary constant of proportionality, $C$, as requested by the problem. Let $C = \\frac{C_2 \\kappa}{C_1}$.\nThen, the functional form of the conductivity is:\n$$ \\sigma(s) = \\frac{C}{s} $$\nThis is the required form for the conductivity to ensure the dielectric remains locally neutral.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{C}{s}}$$", "id": "1609781"}]}
