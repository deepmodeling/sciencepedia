## Introduction
Maxwell's equations in differential form represent the pinnacle of classical electromagnetic theory, providing a complete and local description of the behavior of electric and magnetic fields. While their integral counterparts describe phenomena over extended regions, the differential form offers a powerful, point-by-point perspective, revealing the intricate dance between fields, charges, and currents at every location in space and time. This article delves into this localized framework to uncover the fundamental principles governing electromagnetism. It addresses the need to understand not just what the fields are, but how they are dynamically constrained and how their interplay gives rise to profound physical laws and phenomena.

This exploration is structured into three chapters. The first, **Principles and Mechanisms**, will introduce the four differential equations, unpack their physical meaning, and demonstrate their predictive power by deriving fundamental consequences such as the [conservation of charge](@entry_id:264158) and the existence of [electromagnetic waves](@entry_id:269085). The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, will showcase the versatility of Maxwell's equations by applying them to diverse fields, including materials science, [plasma physics](@entry_id:139151), and even general relativity, bridging the gap between abstract theory and real-world phenomena. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section provides an opportunity to solidify your understanding by applying these concepts to solve concrete problems, reinforcing the theoretical foundations established in the preceding chapters.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The transition from the integral to the [differential form](@entry_id:174025) of Maxwell's equations marks a pivotal moment in the study of electromagnetism. While the integral laws describe the relationships between fields and their sources over regions of space and surfaces, the differential laws provide a local, point-by-point description. This localization transforms the laws of electromagnetism into a set of coupled partial differential equations, whose solutions describe the behavior of fields throughout space and time. This chapter will explore the principles encapsulated in these differential equations and the mechanisms through which they govern the universe of electromagnetic phenomena.

### The Four Maxwell's Equations in Differential Form

Maxwell's equations in [differential form](@entry_id:174025) constitute a complete classical theory of electromagnetism. They describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated by and interact with electric charges and currents. We present them here in their full glory. In the subsequent sections, we will unpack the profound physics contained within each.

1.  **Gauss's Law for Electricity:**
    $$ \nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} $$
    This equation states that the divergence of the electric field $\vec{E}$ at any point is proportional to the [volume charge density](@entry_id:264747) $\rho$ at that same point. In essence, electric charges are the [sources and sinks](@entry_id:263105) of the electric field; field lines originate on positive charges and terminate on negative ones.

2.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:**
    $$ \nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0 $$
    This law asserts that the divergence of the magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is zero everywhere. This is a mathematical statement of the experimental fact that there are no [magnetic monopoles](@entry_id:142817)—isolated "magnetic charges" from which magnetic field lines could originate or terminate. Magnetic field lines must always form closed loops.

3.  **Faraday's Law of Induction:**
    $$ \nabla \times \vec{E} = - \frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t} $$
    Faraday's Law reveals a deep connection between [electricity and magnetism](@entry_id:184598). It states that a time-varying magnetic field induces a spatially-varying electric field with non-zero curl. Such an electric field is fundamentally different from the electrostatic fields produced by charges; it is non-conservative and its field lines can form closed loops.

4.  **Ampere-Maxwell Law:**
    $$ \nabla \times \vec{B} = \mu_0 \vec{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \vec{E}}{\partial t} $$
    This law describes the two sources of magnetic fields. The first term, involving the [volume current density](@entry_id:268648) $\vec{J}$, reflects the original Ampere's Law: electric currents produce circulating magnetic fields. The second term, Maxwell's crucial addition, is the **[displacement current](@entry_id:190231)**. It posits that a [time-varying electric field](@entry_id:197741) also acts as a source for a circulating magnetic field, placing $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ on a symmetric footing.

Here, $\epsilon_0$ is the [permittivity of free space](@entry_id:272823) and $\mu_0$ is the [permeability of free space](@entry_id:276113), [fundamental constants](@entry_id:148774) that characterize the electromagnetic properties of a vacuum.

To understand these abstract equations, let us examine how they constrain and define the fields. Consider Gauss's Law for electricity. If one is given an electric field, this law allows for the direct determination of the charge distribution that must have created it. For instance, suppose a hypothetical static electric field in a spherically symmetric medium is described by $\vec{E}(\vec{r}) = \frac{V_0}{r_0} \exp(-(r/r_0)^2) \hat{r}$ [@problem_id:569835]. By calculating the divergence of this field in spherical coordinates, $\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{d}{dr}(r^2 E_r)$, we can find the precise [charge density](@entry_id:144672) $\rho(r)$ at every point in space required to sustain such a field. The equation $\rho = \epsilon_0 (\nabla \cdot \vec{E})$ becomes a direct tool for mapping a field to its source.

Similarly, Gauss's law for magnetism places a strong constraint on the possible geometry of any magnetic field. If a researcher proposes a magnetic field model of the form $\vec{B} = f(s) \hat{s}$ in a [cylindrical coordinate system](@entry_id:266798) (where $s$ is the radial distance from the z-axis), the condition $\nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0$ immediately restricts the functional form of $f(s)$ [@problem_id:1807157]. Calculating the [divergence in cylindrical coordinates](@entry_id:273276), $\nabla \cdot \vec{B} = \frac{1}{s}\frac{d}{ds}(s f(s))$, and setting it to zero forces the conclusion that $s f(s)$ must be a constant. This implies that the only physically permissible function is $f(s) = C/s$, for some constant $C$. Any other radial dependency would imply the existence of [magnetic monopoles](@entry_id:142817), which are forbidden by this fundamental law.

The curl equations operate in a similar manner. A spatially uniform magnetic field that oscillates in time, such as $\vec{B}(t) = B_0 \cos(\omega t) \hat{z}$, must be accompanied by an electric field whose curl is non-zero [@problem_id:1610328]. Faraday's Law, $\nabla \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}$, directly yields the curl of the [induced electric field](@entry_id:267314) as $\nabla \times \vec{E} = B_0 \omega \sin(\omega t) \hat{z}$. This tells us that the induced E-field must circulate around the regions of changing magnetic flux. Conversely, if a steady current density, such as $\vec{J} = J_0 (s/R) \hat{z}$ inside a wire, is present, the Ampere-Maxwell law (with $\partial\vec{E}/\partial t = 0$ for a steady state) dictates that the curl of the magnetic field at any point inside the wire must be $\nabla \times \vec{B} = \mu_0 \vec{J} = \mu_0 J_0 (s/R) \hat{z}$ [@problem_id:1610332]. The structure of the current density directly determines the local circulation of the magnetic field.

### The Interplay of Fields and Sources

Maxwell's equations are not a collection of independent statements but a tightly coupled [system of differential equations](@entry_id:262944). The fields, charges, and currents must all be mutually consistent. Specifying one component of the system often determines the others. A powerful way to appreciate this interconnectedness is to start with a hypothetical field and use the equations to deduce all the other quantities required for its existence.

Let us consider a theoretical model where the electric field in a vacuum is given by the purely rotational, time-dependent expression $\vec{E}(\vec{r}, t) = \alpha r^{3} t^{2} \hat{\phi}$ in cylindrical coordinates [@problem_id:1807148]. What charge and current distributions are necessary to sustain this field?

First, we apply Gauss's law to find the charge density $\rho$. The divergence of this field, $\nabla \cdot \vec{E}$, is zero because the field has no radial component and its azimuthal component does not vary with $\phi$. Consequently, the required [charge density](@entry_id:144672) is $\rho = \epsilon_0 (\nabla \cdot \vec{E}) = 0$.

Next, we use Faraday's law, $\nabla \times \vec{E} = -\partial\vec{B}/\partial t$, to find the magnetic field. The curl of the given $\vec{E}$ field is found to be $\nabla \times \vec{E} = 4\alpha r^2 t^2 \hat{z}$. This implies that the rate of change of the magnetic field is $\partial\vec{B}/\partial t = -4\alpha r^2 t^2 \hat{z}$. Integrating with respect to time gives the magnetic field itself: $\vec{B}(r, t) = -\frac{4}{3}\alpha r^2 t^3 \hat{z}$ (assuming no pre-existing static magnetic field).

Finally, we use the Ampere-Maxwell law, $\nabla \times \vec{B} = \mu_0 \vec{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \partial\vec{E}/\partial t$, to determine the current density $\vec{J}$. We have already found $\vec{B}$ and we can easily calculate $\partial\vec{E}/\partial t = 2\alpha r^3 t \hat{\phi}$. We compute the curl of $\vec{B}$, which is $\nabla \times \vec{B} = \frac{8}{3}\alpha r t^3 \hat{\phi}$. Rearranging the Ampere-Maxwell law to solve for $\vec{J}$ gives:
$$ \vec{J} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} (\nabla \times \vec{B}) - \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \vec{E}}{\partial t} $$
Substituting our calculated expressions yields:
$$ \vec{J}(r, t) = \left( \frac{8\alpha}{3\mu_0} r t^3 - 2\epsilon_0 \alpha r^3 t \right) \hat{\phi} $$
This exercise vividly illustrates the rigid logical structure of Maxwell's theory. The initial assumption of a purely rotational, [time-varying electric field](@entry_id:197741) necessitates the absence of [charge density](@entry_id:144672) but requires the existence of both a corresponding magnetic field and a specific, non-trivial [current density](@entry_id:190690) to sustain the system. The four equations work in concert, weaving a self-consistent tapestry of fields and sources.

### Fundamental Consequences of Maxwell's Equations

Beyond describing the immediate relationships between fields and sources, Maxwell's equations harbor deeper truths about the physical world. Their structure gives rise to some of the most fundamental principles in physics, including the conservation of charge and the existence of light itself.

#### The Continuity Equation and Conservation of Charge

One of the most profound consequences of Maxwell's equations is that the conservation of electric charge is not an independent assumption but a mathematical certainty embedded within the laws themselves. This principle is expressed through the **[continuity equation](@entry_id:145242)**.

To derive it, we take the divergence of the Ampere-Maxwell law:
$$ \nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \vec{B}) = \nabla \cdot \left( \mu_0 \vec{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \vec{E}}{\partial t} \right) $$
A fundamental vector calculus identity states that the [divergence of a curl](@entry_id:271562) is always zero, so the left side vanishes: $\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \vec{B}) = 0$. The right side can be expanded using the linearity of the [divergence operator](@entry_id:265975):
$$ 0 = \mu_0 (\nabla \cdot \vec{J}) + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \nabla \cdot \left(\frac{\partial \vec{E}}{\partial t}\right) $$
Assuming space and time coordinates are independent, we can switch the order of the divergence and time derivative operators. Then, we substitute Gauss's law, $\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \rho / \epsilon_0$:
$$ 0 = \mu_0 (\nabla \cdot \vec{J}) + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \right) $$
$$ 0 = \mu_0 (\nabla \cdot \vec{J}) + \mu_0 \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} $$
Dividing by $\mu_0$ and rearranging gives the celebrated continuity equation:
$$ \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \vec{J} = 0 $$
This equation is the mathematical statement of local [charge conservation](@entry_id:151839). It states that the rate of change of [charge density](@entry_id:144672) in a small volume ($\partial \rho / \partial t$) is exactly equal to the negative divergence of the current density ($- \nabla \cdot \vec{J}$), which represents the net flow of charge out of that volume. In other words, charge cannot be created or destroyed at a point; it can only move from one place to another.

To fully appreciate how this principle is a direct result of the specific form of Maxwell's equations, it is instructive to consider a hypothetical universe where the laws are slightly different [@problem_id:569985]. Suppose the Ampere-Maxwell law included an extra term: $\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} + \alpha \mathbf{E}$. Following the exact same derivation—taking the divergence and substituting Gauss's law—we would arrive at a modified [continuity equation](@entry_id:145242):
$$ \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = - \frac{\alpha}{\mu_0 \epsilon_0} \rho $$
In this hypothetical universe, charge is not conserved. The term on the right, $S(\rho) = -(\alpha/\mu_0\epsilon_0)\rho$, acts as a source or sink. If $\alpha > 0$, any local accumulation of charge would spontaneously decay, even in the absence of any current. This thought experiment powerfully demonstrates that charge conservation is not a given, but a direct and elegant consequence of the precise structure of the electromagnetic laws discovered by Maxwell.

#### Electromagnetic Waves

Perhaps the most spectacular prediction of Maxwell's theory is the existence of self-propagating disturbances in the electromagnetic field that travel at a finite speed: electromagnetic waves. In a region of vacuum, free of charges ($\rho=0$) and currents ($\vec{J}=\vec{0}$), Maxwell's equations become:
1. $\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = 0$
2. $\nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0$
3. $\nabla \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}$
4. $\nabla \times \vec{B} = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \vec{E}}{\partial t}$

To see how these equations lead to waves, we can seek to decouple them and find an equation for $\vec{E}$ alone [@problem_id:1807154]. We begin by taking the curl of Faraday's Law (Equation 3):
$$ \nabla \times (\nabla \times \vec{E}) = \nabla \times \left( -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t} \right) = -\frac{\partial}{\partial t} (\nabla \times \vec{B}) $$
Now we can substitute the Ampere-Maxwell law (Equation 4) into the right-hand side:
$$ -\frac{\partial}{\partial t} (\nabla \times \vec{B}) = -\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \vec{E}}{\partial t} \right) = -\mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \vec{E}}{\partial t^2} $$
For the left-hand side, we use the vector identity $\nabla \times (\nabla \times \vec{V}) = \nabla(\nabla \cdot \vec{V}) - \nabla^2 \vec{V}$. Applying this to $\vec{E}$ gives:
$$ \nabla \times (\nabla \times \vec{E}) = \nabla(\nabla \cdot \vec{E}) - \nabla^2 \vec{E} $$
From Equation 1, we know that in a vacuum, $\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = 0$. This simplifies the left-hand side to $-\nabla^2 \vec{E}$. Equating our modified left and right sides gives:
$$ -\nabla^2 \vec{E} = -\mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \vec{E}}{\partial t^2} $$
Rearranging this yields the three-dimensional vector wave equation for the electric field:
$$ \nabla^2 \vec{E} - \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \vec{E}}{\partial t^2} = \vec{0} $$
This is the archetypal equation for a wave propagating with a speed $v = 1/\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}$. Upon substituting the experimentally measured values for $\mu_0$ and $\epsilon_0$, the speed of these waves was found to be approximately $3 \times 10^8$ m/s, the known speed of light. This was the triumphant moment of classical physics, unifying the previously separate fields of electricity, magnetism, and optics. Light was revealed to be an [electromagnetic wave](@entry_id:269629).

#### Potentials and Gauge Freedom

The two homogeneous Maxwell's equations ($\nabla \cdot \vec{B}=0$ and $\nabla \times \vec{E} = -\partial\vec{B}/\partial t$) can be automatically satisfied by introducing a pair of auxiliary functions known as the **scalar potential** $\phi$ and the **vector potential** $\vec{A}$.

Because the divergence of any curl is always zero, the law $\nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0$ is automatically satisfied if we define the magnetic field as the curl of a [vector potential](@entry_id:153642):
$$ \vec{B} = \nabla \times \vec{A} $$
Substituting this into Faraday's law gives:
$$ \nabla \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\nabla \times \vec{A}) = \nabla \times \left(-\frac{\partial \vec{A}}{\partial t}\right) $$
Rearranging, we get $\nabla \times (\vec{E} + \frac{\partial \vec{A}}{\partial t}) = 0$. Since the curl of any gradient is always zero, this second equation is automatically satisfied if we define the quantity in the parenthesis as the gradient of a [scalar potential](@entry_id:276177):
$$ \vec{E} + \frac{\partial \vec{A}}{\partial t} = -\nabla\phi $$
$$ \vec{E} = -\nabla\phi - \frac{\partial\vec{A}}{\partial t} $$
These potentials are not just mathematical tricks; they are central to more advanced formulations of [electrodynamics](@entry_id:158759). However, they are not uniquely defined. One can transform the potentials ($\vec{A}' = \vec{A} + \nabla\lambda$ and $\phi' = \phi - \partial\lambda/\partial t$, where $\lambda$ is any scalar function) without changing the physical fields $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$. This freedom to choose the potentials is called **[gauge invariance](@entry_id:137857)**. To find a unique solution for the potentials, we must impose an extra constraint, known as a **[gauge condition](@entry_id:749729)**.

As an example, consider a standing wave described by the fields $\vec{E}(x, t) = E_0 \sin(kx) \sin(\omega t) \hat{y}$ and $\vec{B}(x, t) = B_0 \cos(kx) \cos(\omega t) \hat{z}$, with $E_0 = \omega B_0/k$ [@problem_id:569914]. Let's find the [vector potential](@entry_id:153642) $\vec{A}$ that generates these fields, working in the **Coulomb gauge**, which is defined by the condition $\nabla \cdot \vec{A} = 0$, and further assuming the scalar potential $\phi$ is zero everywhere.

With $\phi=0$, the electric field is given by $\vec{E} = -\partial\vec{A}/\partial t$. From $\vec{B} = \nabla \times \vec{A}$, the component $B_z$ is given by $B_z = (\nabla \times \vec{A})_z = \frac{\partial A_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial A_x}{\partial y}$. The simplest form for $\vec{A}$ that can produce a $\hat{z}$-directed $\vec{B}$ field that only depends on $x$ is $\vec{A} = A_y(x, t) \hat{y}$. This choice also automatically satisfies the Coulomb [gauge condition](@entry_id:749729) $\nabla \cdot \vec{A} = \partial A_y/\partial y = 0$.
The equation for $\vec{B}$ becomes $\frac{\partial A_y}{\partial x} = B_z = B_0 \cos(kx) \cos(\omega t)$. Integrating with respect to $x$ yields:
$$ A_y(x, t) = \frac{B_0}{k} \sin(kx) \cos(\omega t) + C(t) $$
where $C(t)$ is an arbitrary function of time. To determine $C(t)$, we use the equation for $\vec{E}$:
$$ E_y = -\frac{\partial A_y}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left[\frac{B_0}{k} \sin(kx) \cos(\omega t) + C(t)\right] = \frac{\omega B_0}{k} \sin(kx) \sin(\omega t) - \frac{dC}{dt} $$
Comparing this to the given expression for the electric field, $E_y = (E_0) \sin(kx) \sin(\omega t)$, and using the relation $E_0 = \omega B_0/k$, we see that we must have $dC/dt = 0$. Assuming any time-independent integration constant is zero, we find $C(t)=0$. Thus, the [vector potential](@entry_id:153642) is:
$$ \vec{A}(x, t) = \frac{B_0}{k} \sin(kx) \cos(\omega t) \hat{y} $$
This exercise demonstrates how, given a specific gauge choice, the potentials corresponding to known fields can be uniquely determined.

### Energy Conservation and the Uniqueness of Solutions

A complete physical theory must not only describe the mechanisms of interaction but also account for fundamental quantities like energy. Furthermore, for the theory to have predictive power, its solutions under well-posed conditions must be unique. Maxwell's equations satisfy both of these crucial requirements.

#### Poynting's Theorem and Energy Flow

The energy stored in an electromagnetic field is distributed in space, with an energy density given by $u = \frac{1}{2}(\vec{E} \cdot \vec{D} + \vec{B} \cdot \vec{H})$, where in vacuum $\vec{D} = \epsilon_0 \vec{E}$ and $\vec{H} = \vec{B}/\mu_0$. The rate at which this energy density changes at a point can be related to the fields themselves. By taking the time derivative of $u$ and substituting the two curl equations from Maxwell's laws, one can derive a local statement of energy conservation [@problem_id:611907]. The derivation leads to:
$$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = -\nabla \cdot \left( \frac{1}{\mu_0} \vec{E} \times \vec{B} \right) - \vec{J} \cdot \vec{E} $$
This is the differential form of **Poynting's theorem**. It is a continuity equation for energy. The term $\vec{J} \cdot \vec{E}$ represents the rate per unit volume at which the field does work on charges (dissipating energy). The vector quantity $\vec{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \vec{E} \times \vec{B}$ is known as the **Poynting vector**. It represents the energy flux density—the rate of energy flow per unit area. The theorem can be written as:
$$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \vec{S} = - \vec{J} \cdot \vec{E} $$
This states that the rate of increase of energy density at a point ($\partial u/\partial t$) plus the energy flowing out of that point ($\nabla \cdot \vec{S}$) must equal the rate at which energy is being dissipated by the current at that point. Energy is locally conserved.

#### The Uniqueness Theorem

A vital question for any physical theory is whether its solutions are unique. If we specify the charge and current distributions ($\rho$ and $\vec{J}$) within a volume $V$, and also specify the boundary conditions (e.g., the tangential component of $\vec{E}$) on the surface $S$ enclosing $V$ for all time, is the solution for $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ inside $V$ uniquely determined?

The proof of this relies on Poynting's theorem [@problem_id:569926]. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that two different solutions, $(\vec{E}_1, \vec{B}_1)$ and $(\vec{E}_2, \vec{B}_2)$, exist for the same sources and boundary conditions. Let us define the "difference fields" $\delta\vec{E} = \vec{E}_1 - \vec{E}_2$ and $\delta\vec{B} = \vec{B}_1 - \vec{B}_2$. Since Maxwell's equations are linear, these difference fields must satisfy the source-free Maxwell's equations (because the source terms cancel out).

We can now apply Poynting's theorem to these difference fields. Let $u_\delta = \frac{1}{2}\epsilon|\delta\vec{E}|^2 + \frac{1}{2\mu}|\delta\vec{B}|^2$ be the energy density of the difference fields, and $\delta\vec{S} = \frac{1}{\mu}(\delta\vec{E} \times \delta\vec{B})$ be their Poynting vector. Since the difference fields are source-free ($\vec{J}_\delta = 0$), the conservation law for them is simply:
$$ \nabla \cdot \delta\vec{S} = -\frac{\partial u_\delta}{\partial t} $$
Integrating this equation over the entire volume $V$ and applying the [divergence theorem](@entry_id:145271) gives:
$$ \oint_S \delta\vec{S} \cdot d\vec{a} = -\frac{d}{dt} \int_V u_\delta d\tau $$
The boundary conditions (e.g., that $\vec{E}_1$ and $\vec{E}_2$ are the same on the surface $S$) ensure that the difference field $\delta\vec{E}$ (or $\delta\vec{B}$) is zero on the boundary. This makes the surface integral of the difference Poynting vector $\oint_S \delta\vec{S} \cdot d\vec{a}$ equal to zero. Therefore, we are left with:
$$ \frac{d}{dt} \int_V u_\delta d\tau = 0 $$
This means that the total energy stored in the difference fields within the volume $V$ is constant in time. If we assume that at some initial time $t=0$ the fields were identical (i.e., $\vec{E}_1 = \vec{E}_2$ and $\vec{B}_1 = \vec{B}_2$), then the initial energy in the difference fields is zero. Since this energy must remain constant, it is zero for all time. But the energy density $u_\delta$ is a [sum of squares](@entry_id:161049) and is non-negative. The only way for its integral to be zero is if the energy density $u_\delta$ is zero everywhere inside the volume. This, in turn, implies that $\delta\vec{E} = \vec{0}$ and $\delta\vec{B} = \vec{0}$ everywhere. Thus, $\vec{E}_1 = \vec{E}_2$ and $\vec{B}_1 = \vec{B}_2$. The two solutions must be identical.

This uniqueness theorem is a statement of the remarkable completeness and predictive power of Maxwell's theory. It guarantees that for a well-posed physical problem, there is one and only one electromagnetic future.
