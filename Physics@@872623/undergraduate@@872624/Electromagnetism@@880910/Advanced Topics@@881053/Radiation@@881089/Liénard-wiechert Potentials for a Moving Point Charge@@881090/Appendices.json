At time $t=0$, it begins to move with a constant speed $v$ along the positive y-axis. An observer is stationary at the spatial coordinate $\\mathbf{r} = (x_0, 0, 0)$, where $x_0 > 0$. The information (in the form of electromagnetic fields) from the charge at an earlier time, known as the retarded time $t_r$, propagates at the speed of light, $c$, and reaches the observer at a later time $t$. The relationship between these times is governed by the premise that the travel time of the signal equals the difference in observation and emission times.
