After passing through an accelerating cavity, its final kinetic energy is measured to be $K_2 = 8mc^2$, where $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\nIn special relativity, the motion of a particle is often described by its four-velocity (also known as proper velocity), $\\eta^{\\mu}$. This is the rate of change of the particle's spacetime position four-vector, $x^{\\mu} = (ct, \\vec{x})$, with respect to the proper time $\\tau$ of the particle, such that $\\eta^{\\mu} = \\frac{dx^{\\mu}}{d\\tau}$.

We will first determine the initial and final Lorentz factors from the given kinetic energies. Then, we will establish an expression for the magnitude of the spatial proper velocity, $|\\vec{\\eta}|$, in terms of the Lorentz factor. Finally, we will compute the ratio of the final to the initial value of $|\\vec{\\eta}|$.\n\nThe relativistic kinetic energy, $K$, of a particle with rest mass $m$ is given by the total energy $E$ minus the rest energy $mc^2$:\n$$K = E - mc^2$$\nThe total energy is related to the rest mass and the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, by $E = \\gamma mc^2$. Thus, the kinetic energy is:\n$$K = \\gamma mc^2 - mc^2 = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$$\n\nFirst, we find the initial Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_1$, corresponding to the initial kinetic energy $K_1 = mc^2$.\n$$K_1 = (\\gamma_1 - 1)mc^2$$\n$$mc^2 = (\\gamma_1 - 1)mc^2$$\nDividing by $mc^2$ (which is non-zero), we get:\n$$1 = \\gamma_1 - 1 \\implies \\gamma_1 = 2$$\n\nNext, we find the final Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2$, corresponding to the final kinetic energy $K_2 = 8mc^2$.\n$$K_2 = (\\gamma_2 - 1)mc^2$$\n$$8mc^2 = (\\gamma_2 - 1)mc^2$$\nDividing by $mc^2$:\n$$8 = \\gamma_2 - 1 \\implies \\gamma_2 = 9$$\n\nNow, we need to find an expression for the magnitude of the spatial part of the proper velocity, $|\\vec{\\eta}|$.
