The velocity of the vessel relative to the ground, $\\vec{v}_{g}$, is the vector sum of the vessel's velocity relative to the water, $\\vec{v}_{s}$, and the velocity of the water relative to the ground (the current), $\\vec{v}_{c}$. This relationship is expressed as:\n$$ \\vec{v}_{g} = \\vec{v}_{s} + \\vec{v}_{c} $$\nOur goal is to determine the vessel's velocity relative to the water, $\\vec{v}_{s}$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $\\vec{v}_{s}$:\n$$ \\vec{v}_{s} = \\vec{v}_{g} - \\vec{v}_{c} $$\nTo perform this vector subtraction, we will decompose the known vectors, $\\vec{v}_{g}$ and $\\vec{v}_{c}$, into their components in a Cartesian coordinate system. Let's define a standard coordinate system where the positive y-axis points North and the positive x-axis points East.\n\nFirst, we find the components of the desired ground velocity, $\\vec{v}_{g}$. The problem states it has a magnitude $v_{g} = 22.0$ km/h and is directed due North. In our coordinate system, this corresponds to an angle of $90^{\\circ}$ from the positive x-axis.\n$$ v_{g,x} = v_{g} \\cos(90^{\\circ}) = 22.0 \\times 0 = 0 \\text{ km/h} $$\n$$ v_{g,y} = v_{g} \\sin(90^{\\circ}) = 22.0 \\times 1 = 22.0 \\text{ km/h} $$\nSo, $\\vec{v}_{g} = (0 \\hat{i} + 22.0 \\hat{j}) \\text{ km/h}$.\n\nNext, we find the components of the current's velocity, $\\vec{v}_{c}$. It has a magnitude $v_{c} = 8.00$ km/h and is directed Southeast. A Southeast direction is $45.0^{\\circ}$ South of East. In our coordinate system, this is an angle of $-45.0^{\\circ}$ (or $315^{\\circ}$) from the positive x-axis.\n$$ v_{c,x} = v_{c} \\cos(-45.0^{\\circ}) = 8.00 \\cos(45.0^{\\circ}) = 8.00 \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = 4.00\\sqrt{2} \\text{ km/h} $$\n$$ v_{c,y} = v_{c} \\sin(-45.0^{\\circ}) = -8.00 \\sin(45.0^{\\circ}) = -8.00 \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = -4.00\\sqrt{2} \\text{ km/h} $$\nSo, $\\vec{v}_{c} = (4.00\\sqrt{2} \\hat{i} - 4.00\\sqrt{2} \\hat{j}) \\text{ km/h}$.\n\nNow we can calculate the components of $\\vec{v}_{s}$ by subtracting the components of $\\vec{v}_{c}$ from those of $\\vec{v}_{g}$:\n$$ v_{s,x} = v_{g,x} - v_{c,x} = 0 - 4.00\\sqrt{2} = -4.00\\sqrt{2} \\text{ km/h} $$\n$$ v_{s,y} = v_{g,y} - v_{c,y} = 22.0 - (-4.00\\sqrt{2}) = (22.0 + 4.00\\sqrt{2}) \\text{ km/h} $$\nLet's find the numerical values for the components:\n$4.00\\sqrt{2} \\approx 5.65685$ km/h.\n$$ v_{s,x} \\approx -5.65685 \\text{ km/h} $$\n$$ v_{s,y} \\approx 22.0 + 5.65685 = 27.65685 \\text{ km/h} $$\n\nTo find the magnitude of $\\vec{v}_{s}$, we use the Pythagorean theorem:\n$$ v_{s} = |\\vec{v}_{s}| = \\sqrt{v_{s,x}^2 + v_{s,y}^2} = \\sqrt{(-4.00\\sqrt{2})^2 + (22.0 + 4.00\\sqrt{2})^2} $$\n$$ v_{s} = \\sqrt{32.0 + (22.0^2 + 2(22.0)(4.00\\sqrt{2}) + (4.00\\sqrt{2})^2)} $$\n$$ v_{s} = \\sqrt{32.0 + 484 + 176\\sqrt{2} + 32.0} = \\sqrt{548 + 176\\sqrt{2}} $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ v_{s} \\approx \\sqrt{548 + 176(1.41421)} \\approx \\sqrt{548 + 248.90} = \\sqrt{796.90} \\approx 28.23 \\text{ km/h} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the speed of the vessel relative to the water is $v_{s} = 28.2$ km/h.\n\nTo find the direction, we note that $v_{s,x}$ is negative (West) and $v_{s,y}$ is positive (North). The resulting vector is in the second quadrant. The problem asks for the direction as an angle West of North. Let this angle be $\\theta$. We can find $\\theta$ by considering the right triangle formed by the components $v_{s,x}$ and $v_{s,y}$. The angle $\\theta$ is the angle between the vector $\\vec{v}_{s}$ and the positive y-axis (North).\n$$ \\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{|v_{s,x}|}{v_{s,y}} $$\n$$ \\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{4.00\\sqrt{2}}{22.0 + 4.00\\sqrt{2}}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$ \\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{5.65685}{27.65685}\\right) = \\arctan(0.20453) $$\n$$ \\theta \\approx 11.567^{\\circ} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the direction is $\\theta = 11.6^{\\circ}$ West of North.\n\nThe two required values are the magnitude of the velocity, 28.2 km/h, and its direction, 11.6 degrees West of North.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 28.2 & 11.6 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2229336"}, {"introduction": "We now transition from tangible motion to the abstract yet powerful concept of fields, a cornerstone of electromagnetism.
