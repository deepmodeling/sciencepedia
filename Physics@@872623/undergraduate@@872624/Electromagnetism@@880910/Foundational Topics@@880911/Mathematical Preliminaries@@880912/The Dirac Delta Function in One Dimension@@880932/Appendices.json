This is the principle of superposition. We will calculate the potential contribution from each of the three point charges and then sum them up.\n\nThe electrostatic potential $V$ at a distance $r$ from a single point charge $Q$ is given by the formula $V = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r}$, where $\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.
