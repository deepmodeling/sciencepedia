The space is otherwise empty of charge. Two infinite, flat, conducting plates are introduced, which are held at zero electric potential (grounded). The first plate occupies the entire $y-z$ plane (the plane $x=0$), and the second plate occupies the entire $x-z$ plane (the plane $y=0$). These plates form a 90-degree corner. The goal is to determine the electric potential in the region where $x > 0$ and $y > 0$.

The space for the potential solution is the first quadrant $x>0$, $y>0$, with grounded conducting planes at $x=0$ and $y=0$, so the boundary conditions are $V(0,y,0)=0$ for $y>0$ and $V(x,0,0)=0$ for $x>0$.\n\nBy the method of images, the potential in the region of interest can be written as a superposition of Coulomb potentials due to the real charge and suitable image charges located outside the region, chosen to satisfy the boundary conditions. The potential at a point $\\mathbf{r}$ due to point charges $\\{q_{i}\\}$ at positions $\\{\\mathbf{r}_{i}\\}$ is\n$$\nV(\\mathbf{r})=\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}}\\sum_{i}\\frac{q_{i}}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_{i}|}.\n$$\nFirst enforce the boundary condition at $x=0$ for the original charge $+q$ at $(d,d,0)$ by placing an image charge $-q$ at $(-d,d,0)$. This pair makes $V(0,y,0)=0$ for all $y$ if this were the only plane. Similarly, to enforce the boundary condition at $y=0$ for the original charge, place an image charge $-q$ at $(d,-d,0)$. However, introducing both images simultaneously disturbs the other plane. To restore zero potential on both planes, reflect either image across the other plane, which adds a fourth charge at $(-d,-d,0)$ with charge $+q$ (since reflecting $-q$ across a grounded plane flips the sign again).\n\nThus, the complete set of charges is: the real $+q$ at $(d,d,0)$, and three images: $-q$ at $(-d,d,0)$, $-q$ at $(d,-d,0)$, and $+q$ at $(-d,-d,0)$.\n\nVerify the boundary conditions. On the plane $x=0$ with $y>0$, take the field point $\\mathbf{r}=(0,y,0)$. The distances to $(d,d,0)$ and $(-d,d,0)$ are equal:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{r}-(d,d,0)|=\\sqrt{d^{2}+(y-d)^{2}}=|\\mathbf{r}-(-d,d,0)|,\n$$\nand the distances to $(d,-d,0)$ and $(-d,-d,0)$ are equal:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{r}-(d,-d,0)|=\\sqrt{d^{2}+(y+d)^{2}}=|\\mathbf{r}-(-d,-d,0)|.\n$$\nTherefore the potential on $x=0$ is\n$$\nV(0,y,0)=\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}}\\left(\\frac{q}{\\sqrt{d^{2}+(y-d)^{2}}}+\\frac{-q}{\\sqrt{d^{2}+(y-d)^{2}}}+\\frac{-q}{\\sqrt{d^{2}+(y+d)^{2}}}+\\frac{q}{\\sqrt{d^{2}+(y+d)^{2}}}\\right)=0.\n$$\nSimilarly, on the plane $y=0$ with $x>0$, take $\\mathbf{r}=(x,0,0)$. The distances to $(d,d,0)$ and $(d,-d,0)$ are equal:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{r}-(d,d,0)|=\\sqrt{(x-d)^{2}+d^{2}}=|\\mathbf{r}-(d,-d,0)|,\n$$\nand the distances to $(-d,d,0)$ and $(-d,-d,0)$ are equal:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{r}-(-d,d,0)|=\\sqrt{(x+d)^{2}+d^{2}}=|\\mathbf{r}-(-d,-d,0)|.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\nV(x,0,0)=\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}}\\left(\\frac{q}{\\sqrt{(x-d)^{2}+d^{2}}}+\\frac{-q}{\\sqrt{(x-d)^{2}+d^{2}}}+\\frac{-q}{\\sqrt{(x+d)^{2}+d^{2}}}+\\frac{q}{\\sqrt{(x+d)^{2}+d^{2}}}\\right)=0.\n$$\nHence both boundary conditions are satisfied. By the uniqueness theorem for solutions to Laplace’s and Poisson’s equations with specified Dirichlet boundary conditions, the potential in the first quadrant due to this set of charges is the unique physical solution.

This exercise explores the limits of the method by considering a conducting wedge with an angle for which the simple reflection procedure fails to terminate, prompting a deeper investigation into the underlying mathematical and physical reasons for its validity [@problem_id:1800914]. Understanding these limitations is key to appreciating why the more general Green's function formalism is necessary.", "problem": "The method of images is a powerful technique in electrostatics for solving Poisson's equation in the presence of boundary surfaces. Consider a grounded, conducting wedge formed by two semi-infinite planes meeting at an angle $\\alpha$. The planes correspond to the surfaces $\\phi=0$ and $\\phi=\\alpha$ in a cylindrical coordinate system $(\\rho, \\phi, z)$. A point charge $+q$ is placed at $(\\rho_0, \\phi_0, z_0)$ within the wedge (i.e., $0 < \\phi_0 < \\alpha$).\n\nTo find the potential inside the wedge, one can introduce a set of image charges outside the region $0 < \\phi < \\alpha$. The process involves repeatedly reflecting charges across the two planes. A reflection of a charge at an angular position $\\theta$ across a plane at an angular position $\\gamma$ places an image at the new angle $2\\gamma - \\theta$. The sign of the image charge is inverted upon each reflection.\n\nThis process generates a sequence of image charges. For certain angles $\\alpha$, such as $\\alpha=\\pi/n$ where $n$ is an integer, this process terminates, yielding a finite number of image charges. However, for other angles, the process generates an infinite sequence of images.\n\nConsider a case where the angle of the wedge is $\\alpha = \\sqrt{5}$ radians. For this angle, the method of images generates a non-terminating, infinite series of image charges. What is the fundamental physical reason that the simple method of images, as described by this reflection algorithm, fails to produce a solution with a finite number of images for such an angle?\n\nA. The total potential caused by the infinite number of images diverges everywhere inside the wedge.\n\nB. All image charges are generated at a constant radial distance $\\rho_0$ from the vertex, but they lie on a spiral that extends to an infinite distance in the $z$-direction.\n\nC. Successive reflections eventually generate an image charge that is located within the physical region of the wedge itself (i.e., at an angle $\\phi_{img}$ where $0 < \\phi_{img} < \\alpha$), which would unphysically alter the charge distribution in the problem domain.\n\nD. The magnitudes of the image charges diminish with each reflection, approaching zero only after an infinite number of steps.\n\nE. After a certain number of reflections, an image charge is generated at the exact same location as a previously generated image charge, leading to an infinite, repeating cycle.", "solution": "We start from the reflection rule across a plane at angular position $\\gamma \\in \\{0,\\alpha\\}$: a charge at angle $\\theta$ is mapped to $2\\gamma - \\theta$, with its sign inverted. Beginning from the source at $\\phi_{0}$, repeated reflections generate angles that can be shown by induction to lie in the set\n$$\nS=\\{\\pm \\phi_{0}+2m\\alpha: m\\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}.\n$$\nBase cases: reflecting $\\phi_{0}$ across $0$ gives $-\\phi_{0}$, and across $\\alpha$ gives $2\\alpha-\\phi_{0}=-\\phi_{0}+2\\alpha$, both in $S$. Closure: reflecting any $\\pm \\phi_{0}+2m\\alpha$ across $0$ gives $\\mp \\phi_{0}-2m\\alpha\\in S$, and across $\\alpha$ gives $2\\alpha-(\\pm \\phi_{0}+2m\\alpha)=\\mp \\phi_{0}+2(1-m)\\alpha\\in S$.\n\nPhysical positions are determined modulo $2\\pi$, so the distinct image locations correspond to the set $S$ reduced modulo $2\\pi$.

Therefore, the set $S \\bmod 2\\pi$ is infinite and dense. Consequently, there exist integers $m$ such that either $\\phi_{0}+2m\\alpha \\bmod 2\\pi \\in (0,\\alpha)$ or $-\\phi_{0}+2m\\alpha \\bmod 2\\pi \\in (0,\\alpha)$. That is, successive reflections inevitably generate images whose angular positions lie within the physical wedge $0<\\phi<\\alpha$. Placing image charges inside the physical region would unphysically alter the source distribution in the problem domain, violating the premise of the method of images.\n\nThus, the fundamental reason the simple reflection-based method does not yield a finite set of images for $\\alpha=\\sqrt{5}$ is that the symmetry does not close after finitely many reflections; the orbit is infinite and necessarily intrudes into the physical wedge. This rules out a finite image construction that keeps all images outside. The other options are incorrect: the potentials from such image constructions need not diverge (A is false), the images do not spiral in $z$ (B is false; $z=z_{0}$ for all images), the image magnitudes do not diminish (D is false; they remain $\\pm q$), and repetition at the same location (E) occurs only when $\\alpha/\\pi$ is rational, which would enable a finite construction rather than preclude it.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1800914"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond the ad-hoc construction of image charges, this problem demonstrates the formal power of the Green's function.
