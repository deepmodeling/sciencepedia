The trap consists of a hollow cubic container whose interior is a perfect vacuum. The cube is defined by the region $0 \\le x \\le a$, $0 \\le y \\le a$, and $0 \\le z \\le a$. The electric potential on the boundary surfaces of the cube is carefully controlled. Specifically, the potential $V$ is held at zero on the five faces corresponding to $x=0$, $x=a$, $y=0$, $y=a$, and $z=0$.
