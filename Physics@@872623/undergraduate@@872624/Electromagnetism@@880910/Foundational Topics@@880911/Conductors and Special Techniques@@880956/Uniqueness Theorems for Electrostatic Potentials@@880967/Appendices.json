Specifically, we will use the first uniqueness theorem, which applies to problems where the potential is specified on the boundaries of a region.\n\nThe theorem states that for a volume $\\mathcal{V}$ bounded by a surface $\\mathcal{S}$, if the charge density $\\rho$ is specified everywhere inside $\\mathcal{V}$ and the potential $V$ is specified everywhere on the surface $\\mathcal{S}$, then the potential $V(\\mathbf{r})$ is uniquely determined at all points $\\mathbf{r}$ inside $\\mathcal{V}$.\n\nLet's apply this theorem to the given scenario.\nThe volume is $\\mathcal{V}$. The boundary surface is $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nFor the first case, the potential inside is $V_1(\\mathbf{r})$.\n1. The charge density inside $\\mathcal{V}$ is given as zero, i.e., $\\rho=0$. This means that inside $\\mathcal{V}$, the potential $V_1$ must satisfy Laplace's equation: $\\nabla^2 V_1 = 0$.\n2. The potential on the boundary surface $\\mathcal{S}$ is specified as $V_{\\mathcal{S}}(\\mathbf{r})$. So, for any point $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathcal{S}}$ on the surface, $V_1(\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathcal{S}}) = V_{\\mathcal{S}}(\\mathbf{r})$.\n\nFor the second case, the potential inside is $V_2(\\mathbf{r})$.\n1. The charge density inside $\\mathcal{V}$ is also zero, so $V_2$ must also satisfy Laplace's equation: $\\nabla^2 V_2 = 0$.\n2. The problem states that the second charge distribution $\\rho_2$ is arranged to produce the same potential on the boundary. So, for any point $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathcal{S}}$ on the surface, $V_2(\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathcal{S}}) = V_{\\mathcal{S}}(\\mathbf{r})$.\n\nWe have two potentials, $V_1$ and $V_2$, that are proposed as solutions for the electrostatic potential within the volume $\\mathcal{V}$. Let's define a new potential function, $V_D(\\mathbf{r})$, as the difference between these two potentials:\n$$V_D(\\mathbf{r}) = V_1(\\mathbf{r}) - V_2(\\mathbf{r})$$\n\nNow, let's examine the properties of $V_D(\\mathbf{r})$ inside the volume $\\mathcal{V}$ and on its boundary $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nInside the volume $\\mathcal{V}$, since the Laplacian operator $\\nabla^2$ is a linear operator, we have:\n$$\\nabla^2 V_D = \\nabla^2(V_1 - V_2) = \\nabla^2 V_1 - \\nabla^2 V_2$$\nBecause both $V_1$ and $V_2$ satisfy Laplace's equation inside $\\mathcal{V}$, we have $\\nabla^2 V_1 = 0$ and $\\nabla^2 V_2 = 0$. Therefore,\n$$\\nabla^2 V_D = 0 - 0 = 0$$\nThis means that the difference potential $V_D$ also satisfies Laplace's equation throughout the volume $\\mathcal{V}$.\n\nOn the boundary surface $\\mathcal{S}$, the value of $V_D$ is:\n$$V_D(\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathcal{S}}) = V_1(\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathcal{S}}) - V_2(\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathcal{S}})$$\nFrom the problem statement, we know that on the surface $\\mathcal{S}$, $V_1(\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathcal{S}}) = V_{\\mathcal{S}}(\\mathbf{r})$ and $V_2(\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathcal{S}}) = V_{\\mathcal{S}}(\\mathbf{r})$. Thus,\n$$V_D(\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathcal{S}}) = V_{\\mathcal{S}}(\\mathbf{r}) - V_{\\mathcal{S}}(\\mathbf{r}) = 0$$\nSo, the potential $V_D$ is zero everywhere on the boundary surface $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nWe now have a function, $V_D$, that satisfies Laplace's equation inside a volume and is equal to zero everywhere on the boundary of that volume. A fundamental property of solutions to Laplace's equation (which can be derived from Green's identities) is that they cannot have any local maxima or minima within the region of interest; the extreme values must occur on the boundary.\n\nIn our case, the maximum value of $V_D$ on the boundary is 0, and the minimum value of $V_D$ on the boundary is also 0. Therefore, for any point $\\mathbf{r}$ inside the volume $\\mathcal{V}$, the potential $V_D(\\mathbf{r})$ must be bounded by these extreme values:\n$$0 \\le V_D(\\mathbf{r}) \\le 0$$\nThe only way for this condition to hold is if $V_D(\\mathbf{r}) = 0$ for all points $\\mathbf{r}$ inside $\\mathcal{V}$.\n\nSince $V_D(\\mathbf{r}) = V_1(\\mathbf{r}) - V_2(\\mathbf{r})$, we have:\n$$V_1(\\mathbf{r}) - V_2(\\mathbf{r}) = 0$$\n$$V_1(\\mathbf{r}) = V_2(\\mathbf{r})$$\n\nThis shows that the two potentials must be identical everywhere inside the volume. The specific arrangement of the external charges $\\rho_1$ and $\\rho_2$ is irrelevant, as long as they produce the same boundary potential. The potential inside is uniquely determined by the boundary conditions. This corresponds to option A. Option E is incorrect because the potential $V_{\\mathcal{S}}$ is not stated to be zero, so the internal potential is not necessarily zero either.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1839115"}, {"introduction": "Having established the principle for fixed potentials, we now turn to a different but equally important scenario: fixed electric fields on the boundary.

The electrostatic potential $V$ within such a region is governed by Laplace's equation:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 V = 0\n$$\nThe region is bounded by a surface $S$. The problem states that the component of the electric field normal to the surface, $E_n$, is zero everywhere on $S$. The electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ is related to the potential $V$ by $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla V$. The component of $\\mathbf{E}$ normal to the surface is given by $E_n = \\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}} = -\\nabla V \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$, where $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$ is the outward unit normal vector to the surface. The expression $\\nabla V \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$ is the directional derivative of $V$ in the normal direction, commonly written as $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial n}$.\n\nThus, the boundary condition is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial n} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all points on } S\n$$\nThis type of boundary condition, where the normal derivative of the function is specified, is known as a Neumann boundary condition. The Uniqueness Theorem for Laplace's equation states that with either the potential itself (Dirichlet condition) or its normal derivative (Neumann condition) specified on the boundary, the solution for the potential inside is determined up to an additive constant.

So, the term $V_D \\nabla^2 V_D$ is zero.\n- On the surface $S$, we know $\\frac{\\partial V_D}{\\partial n} = 0$. So, the entire surface integral on the right-hand side is zero.\n\nThe identity thus reduces to:\n$$\n\\int_V (\\nabla V_D \\cdot \\nabla V_D) \\, d\\tau = 0\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\int_V |\\nabla V_D|^2 \\, d\\tau = 0\n$$\nThe integrand $|\\nabla V_D|^2$ is the squared magnitude of a vector and is therefore non-negative at every point in the volume. The only way for the integral of a non-negative continuous function over a volume to be zero is if the function itself is zero everywhere within that volume.\nTherefore, we must have:\n$$\n|\\nabla V_D|^2 = 0 \\quad \\text{everywhere inside } V\n$$\nThis implies that $\\nabla V_D = \\mathbf{0}$ everywhere inside $V$.\nIf the gradient of a scalar function is zero throughout a connected region, the function must be constant throughout that region. Hence,\n$$\nV_D = C \\quad (\\text{where C is a constant})\n$$\nSubstituting back $V_D = V_1 - V_2$, we get $V_1 - V_2 = C$, or $V_1 = V_2 + C$. This confirms that any two solutions to the problem can differ only by a constant.\n\nNow, we need to determine what this implies for the potential $V$. Consider the simplest possible solution: $V(\\mathbf{r}) = K$, where $K$ is any constant.\n- This solution satisfies Laplace's equation: $\\nabla^2 K = 0$.\n- The electric field is $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla K = \\mathbf{0}$.\n- The normal component of the field on the boundary is $E_n = 0$, which satisfies the boundary condition.\nSo, $V = \\text{constant}$ is a valid solution. Since the uniqueness theorem tells us that any other solution can only differ from this one by an additive constant, any valid solution must also be a constant potential (e.g., $K + C$, which is just another constant).\n\nTherefore, the only possible form for the potential $V$ inside the volume is that it is constant.\n- Option A is incorrect because the constant does not have to be zero.\n- Option B correctly states that the potential must be constant.\n- Option C is incorrect. If $\\mathbf{E}$ were a non-zero constant, then $V$ would be a linear function of position (e.g., $V = -E_0 z$), not a constant. This would also violate the boundary condition for a general closed surface.\n- Option D provides a specific non-constant function which is not a general solution.\n- Option E is incorrect because a definitive conclusion can be reached.\n\nThe most complete and correct conclusion is that the potential $V$ must be a constant value everywhere inside the volume $V$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1839097"}, {"introduction": "The previous practice introduced the idea that Neumann boundary conditions determine the potential only up to a constant.
