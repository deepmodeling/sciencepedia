However, we must consider the range of the arctangent function. The function $y = \\arctan(x)$ is defined as the inverse of the tangent function restricted to the principal domain. The domain of $\\arctan(x)$ is all real numbers, $(-\\infty, \\infty)$, but its range is the open interval $(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\n\nThis means that for any real number $x$, the value of $\\arctan(x)$ must satisfy the inequality:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\pi}{2}  \\arctan(x)  \\frac{\\pi}{2}\n$$\nTo determine if a solution exists, we can compare the required value, $-2$, with the bounds of this range. We know the approximate value of $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$. Therefore, the lower bound of the range is:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\approx -1.5708\n$$\nThe equation for the fixed point requires $\\arctan(x^*) = -2$. Since $-2$ is less than $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the value $-2$ lies outside the range of the arctangent function.\n$$\n-2  -\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\approx -1.5708\n$$\nThus, there is no real number $x^*$ that can satisfy the condition $\\arctan(x^*) = -2$. This implies that the system has no fixed points.\n\nNow let's analyze the sign of $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ to verify this conclusion and select the correct option. The rate of change is $\\dot{x} = 2 + \\arctan(x)$. As we established, the minimum possible value of $\\arctan(x)$ is its infimum, $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.
