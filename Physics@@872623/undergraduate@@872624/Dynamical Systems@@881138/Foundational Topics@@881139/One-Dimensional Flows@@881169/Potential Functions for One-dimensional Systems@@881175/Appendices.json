The force $F(x)$ is related to the potential energy by $F(x) = -\\frac{dV(x)}{dx}$. Therefore, we need to find the points $x$ where $\\frac{dV}{dx} = 0$.\n\nFirst, let's compute the first derivative of the potential energy function $V(x)$:\n$$V(x) = A \\left[ \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{a}\\right) \\right]$$\nUsing the chain rule, the derivative is:\n$$\\frac{dV}{dx} = A \\left[ -\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{a} + \\frac{1}{2} \\left(-\\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\right) \\cdot \\frac{4\\pi}{a} \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{dV}{dx} = -A \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\left[ \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) + \\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{a}\\right) \\right]$$\nTo simplify the search for roots, let's introduce a dimensionless variable $u = \\frac{2\\pi x}{a}$. As $x$ ranges over the specified interval $[0, a)$, the variable $u$ ranges over the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$. The equation for equilibrium positions, $\\frac{dV}{dx} = 0$, becomes:\n$$-\\frac{2\\pi A}{a} \\left[ \\sin(u) + \\sin(2u) \\right] = 0$$\nSince $A > 0$ and $a > 0$, the prefactor is non-zero. Thus, we must solve:\n$$\\sin(u) + \\sin(2u) = 0$$\nUsing the double-angle identity $\\sin(2u) = 2\\sin(u)\\cos(u)$, we get:\n$$\\sin(u) + 2\\sin(u)\\cos(u) = 0$$\n$$\\sin(u) \\left(1 + 2\\cos(u)\\right) = 0$$\nThis equation is satisfied if either $\\sin(u) = 0$ or $1 + 2\\cos(u) = 0$.\n\nCase 1: $\\sin(u) = 0$\nIn the interval $u \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, this occurs at $u = 0$ and $u = \\pi$.\n\nCase 2: $1 + 2\\cos(u) = 0$\nThis implies $\\cos(u) = -\\frac{1}{2}$.
