For linear systems, this evolution can be described by matrix-vector multiplication.

The relationship is given by $\\mathbf{v}_{k+1} = L(\\mathbf{v}_k)$, which can be represented by a matrix multiplication $\\mathbf{v}_{k+1} = M \\mathbf{v}_k$, where $M$ is the matrix corresponding to the transformation $L$.\n\nFirst, we must find the matrix $M$. The transformation $L$ is a composition of two operations: a rotation followed by a scaling. Let's find the matrix for each operation.\n\nThe first operation is a counter-clockwise rotation about the origin by an angle $\\theta = 45^\\circ$. The standard matrix for a counter-clockwise rotation by an angle $\\theta$ in a 2D plane is:\n$$\nR(\\theta) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta  -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta  \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor $\\theta = 45^\\circ$, we have $\\cos(45^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ and $\\sin(45^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Substituting these values gives the rotation matrix $R_{45}$:\n$$\nR_{45} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}  -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe second operation is a uniform scaling by a factor of $s = \\sqrt{2}$. The matrix for such a scaling is $S_s = sI$, where $I$ is the identity matrix:\n$$\nS_{\\sqrt{2}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{2}  0 \\\\ 0  \\sqrt{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe total transformation $L$ is a composition of the rotation followed by the scaling. If $\\mathbf{v}$ is a vector, applying the rotation first gives $R_{45} \\mathbf{v}$. Applying the scaling to this result gives $S_{\\sqrt{2}} (R_{45} \\mathbf{v})$. Therefore, the matrix $M$ for the full transformation $L$ is the product of the individual matrices, with the matrix for the first operation on the right:\n$$\nM = S_{\\sqrt{2}} R_{45} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{2}  0 \\\\ 0  \\sqrt{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}  -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nPerforming the matrix multiplication:\n$$\nM = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + 0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}  \\sqrt{2} \\cdot (-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}) + 0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}  0 \\cdot (-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}) + \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1 \\\\ 1  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nWe need to find the state vector $\\mathbf{v}_4$. Since $\\mathbf{v}_{k+1} = M \\mathbf{v}_k$, we have $\\mathbf{v}_1 = M \\mathbf{v}_0$, $\\mathbf{v}_2 = M \\mathbf{v}_1 = M(M \\mathbf{v}_0) = M^2 \\mathbf{v}_0$, and in general, $\\mathbf{v}_k = M^k \\mathbf{v}_0$. Thus, we need to compute $\\mathbf{v}_4 = M^4 \\mathbf{v}_0$.\n\nWe can calculate $M^4$ by repeated squaring:\n$$\nM^2 = M \\cdot M = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1 \\\\ 1  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1 \\\\ 1  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1(1) + (-1)(1)  1(-1) + (-1)(1) \\\\ 1(1) + 1(1)  1(-1) + 1(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -2 \\\\ 2  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nM^4 = M^2 \\cdot M^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -2 \\\\ 2  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -2 \\\\ 2  0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0(0) + (-2)(2)  0(-2) + (-2)(0) \\\\ 2(0) + 0(2)  2(-2) + 0(0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -4  0 \\\\ 0  -4 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nAlternatively, one can recognize that $M = s R(\\theta)$ and use the property that $(R(\\theta))^n = R(n\\theta)$.\n$M^4 = (S_{\\sqrt{2}} R_{45})^4 = (\\sqrt{2} I \\cdot R_{45})^4 = (\\sqrt{2})^4 (R_{45})^4$.\n$(\\sqrt{2})^4 = 4$.\n$(R_{45})^4 = R(4 \\times 45^\\circ) = R(180^\\circ)$.\nThe matrix for a $180^\\circ$ rotation is:\n$$\nR(180^\\circ) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(180^\\circ)  -\\sin(180^\\circ) \\\\ \\sin(180^\\circ)  \\cos(180^\\circ) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} = -I\n$$\nSo, $M^4 = 4 \\cdot (-I) = -4I = \\begin{pmatrix} -4  0 \\\\ 0  -4 \\end{pmatrix}$. This confirms the previous calculation.\n\nNow we can find $\\mathbf{v}_4$ by applying $M^4$ to the initial vector $\\mathbf{v}_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_4 = M^4 \\mathbf{v}_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} -4  0 \\\\ 0  -4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -4(2) + 0(0) \\\\ 0(2) + (-4)(0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe components of the state vector $\\mathbf{v}_4$ are $x_4 = -8$ and $y_4 = 0$.
