The term $\\frac{1}{2}f(x-ct)$ is a wave of half the initial amplitude traveling to the right with speed $c$. The term $\\frac{1}{2}f(x+ct)$ is a wave of half the initial amplitude traveling to the left with speed $c$.\nThe initial condition $f(x)$ is a step function with jump discontinuities at $x = -L$ and $x = L$. The function $f(x-ct)$ will have jump discontinuities where its argument is $\\pm L$, i.e., at $x-ct = \\pm L$, which means $x = ct \\pm L$. Similarly, $f(x+ct)$ will have jump discontinuities at $x = -ct \\pm L$. Since $u(x,t)$ is a linear combination of these two functions, it will also possess these jump discontinuities. The discontinuities of the initial condition are not smoothed out; they propagate outwards at a finite speed $c$. Therefore, for any $t0$, the solution $u(x,t)$ remains discontinuous. Furthermore, due to the nature of the solution, the disturbance is confined. For a given time $t$, $f(x-ct)$ is non-zero only when $|x-ct|  L$, and $f(x+ct)$ is non-zero only when $|x+ct|  L$. This means the solution $u(x,t)$ is zero for $|x|  L+ct$.

A key property of the Gaussian function is that it is positive for all real inputs and is infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$) everywhere.\nThe solution $v(x,t)$ is formed by an integral that effectively averages the initial condition $f(y)$ against the smooth weighting function $\\Phi(x-y, t)$. A fundamental result in analysis states that the convolution of a function (even a discontinuous one like our $f(x)$) with an infinitely differentiable function results in an infinitely differentiable function. Intuitively, the smoothing nature of the Gaussian \"smears out\" any sharp jumps or corners in the initial data. Therefore, for any arbitrarily small time $t  0$, the solution $v(x,t)$ will be a continuous and infinitely differentiable function of $x$ for all $x \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$. This phenomenon is known as the instantaneous smoothing property of the heat equation.\nFurthermore, since the heat kernel $\\Phi(x-y, t)$ is strictly positive for all $x$ and $y$ when $t0$, and $f(y)$ is positive on the interval $[-L, L]$, the integral for $v(x,t)$ will be positive for all $x \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$. This implies that the initial localized heat pulse has an instantaneous effect across the entire domain, a property known as infinite speed of propagation.\n\nComparing the two behaviors:\n- The wave equation preserves discontinuities, which propagate at a finite speed $c$.\n- The heat equation instantaneously smooths out all discontinuities for any $t0$.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\nA. This statement correctly describes that the wave solution $u(x,t)$ will have jump discontinuities that propagate, while the heat solution $v(x,t)$ becomes infinitely differentiable for $t0$.

The wave equation preserves discontinuities, and the heat equation smooths them.\nE. The first part about the wave solution is correct. However, the second part is incorrect. The heat solution $v(x,t)$ is non-zero everywhere for $t0$, not just in the initial region, due to the infinite speed of propagation.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the most accurate and complete qualitative comparison.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2113327"}]}
