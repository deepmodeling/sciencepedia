The map satisfies none of the three conditions.", "solution": "We first recall the definitions in this discrete setting. Since $X=\\{A,B,C\\}$ has the discrete topology, every subset is open. The map $f$ is the $3$-cycle $A \\mapsto B \\mapsto C \\mapsto A$. The metric is the discrete metric $d(x,y)=0$ if $x=y$ and $d(x,y)=1$ if $x \\neq y$.\n\nTopological transitivity: Let $U,V \\subseteq X$ be arbitrary non-empty open sets. Then there exist $x \\in U$ and $y \\in V$. Because $f$ is a $3$-cycle, the orbit of any $x \\in X$ is all of $X$, and specifically there exists $k \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ such that $f^{k}(x)=y$. Hence $f^{k}(U) \\supseteq f^{k}(\\{x\\})=\\{f^{k}(x)\\}=\\{y\\} \\subseteq V$, so $f^{k}(U) \\cap V \\neq \\emptyset$. Therefore $f$ is topologically transitive.\n\nDense periodic points: For each $x \\in X$, we have $f^{3}(x)=x$, so every point is periodic (in fact, of period $3$). Thus the set of periodic points $P$ equals $X$. For any non-empty open $U \\subseteq X$, $P \\cap U = U \\neq \\emptyset$, so periodic points are dense.\n\nSensitive dependence on initial conditions: The definition requires the existence of $\\delta0$ such that for any $x \\in X$ and any open neighborhood $U$ of $x$, there exists $y \\in U$ with $y \\neq x$ and $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $d\\bigl(f^{n}(x),f^{n}(y)\\bigr)\\delta$. In the discrete topology, the singleton $\\{x\\}$ is an open neighborhood of $x$. Taking $U=\\{x\\}$, there is no $y \\in U$ with $y \\neq x$, so the existential condition on $y$ fails. This shows that no such $\\delta$ can satisfy the sensitivity condition. Therefore $f$ is not sensitive to initial conditions.\n\nCombining these, $f$ is topologically transitive and has dense periodic points, but does not have sensitive dependence on initial conditions.

Let $D=\\{(t,t):t\\in \\mathbb{T}^{1}\\}$ denote the diagonal.\n\nFirst, observe that for any $(x,y)$, $f(x,y)\\in D$ because both coordinates of $f(x,y)$ are equal to $s=\\left(\\frac{x+y}{2}\\right)\\bmod 1$.

Since the image of the map is a proper subset of the domain, $f(\\mathbb{T}^2) \\subseteq D \\subsetneq \\mathbb{T}^2$, the map is not surjective. We can choose an open set $V$ that is disjoint from the diagonal $D$. For any non-empty open set $U$, all iterates $f^n(U)$ for $n \\ge 1$ are subsets of $D$. Therefore, $f^n(U) \\cap V = \\emptyset$ for all $n \\ge 1$. This violates the definition of TT, so TT fails.\n\n2) Density of periodic points (DP). A point $(x,y)$ is periodic if $f^{n}(x,y)=(x,y)$ for some $n\\in \\mathbb{N}$. After one iteration, $f(x,y)$ lies on the diagonal $D$. For $n \\ge 1$, $f^n(x,y) = f(x,y)$ because points on $D$ are fixed. Thus, for a point $(x,y)$ to be periodic, it must satisfy $(x,y) = f(x,y)$. This implies that the set of periodic points is identical to the set of fixed points, which is the diagonal $D$. The set $D$ is a closed, one-dimensional subset of the two-dimensional torus $\\mathbb{T}^2$, and is therefore not dense in $\\mathbb{T}^2$. Thus DP fails.\n\n3) Sensitive dependence on initial conditions (SDIC). Let $p=(x,y)$ and $q=(x',y')$. The distance between their first iterates is $d(f(p), f(q))$. Using the standard Euclidean metric on the torus (locally), and letting $s = (x+y)/2$ and $s'=(x'+y')/2$, we have\n$$\nd(f(p),f(q))^2 = d((s,s), (s',s'))^2 = 2(s-s')^2 = 2\\left(\\frac{(x-x')+(y-y')}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}((x-x')+(y-y'))^2\n$$\nBy the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, $((x-x')+(y-y'))^2 \\le (1^2+1^2)((x-x')^2+(y-y')^2) = 2d(p,q)^2$.\nThus, $d(f(p),f(q))^2 \\le \\frac{1}{2}(2d(p,q)^2) = d(p,q)^2$, which implies $d(f(p),f(q)) \\le d(p,q)$.\nThe map is non-expanding. For any $n \\ge 1$, $f^n(p) = f(p)$ and $f^n(q)=f(q)$, so the distance between iterates never increases beyond the first step. Given any $\\delta > 0$, we can choose any neighborhood $N$ of a point $p$ small enough such that for all $q \\in N$, $d(p,q)  \\delta$. Since $d(f^n(p), f^n(q)) \\le d(p,q)$, it follows that $d(f^n(p), f^n(q))  \\delta$ for all $n \\ge 1$. Thus, the condition for SDIC can never be met.
