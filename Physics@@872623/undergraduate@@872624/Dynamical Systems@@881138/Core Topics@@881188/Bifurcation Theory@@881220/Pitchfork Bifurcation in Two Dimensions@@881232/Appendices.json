Thus, for $\\mu < 0$, the only fixed point is $P_0 = (0, 0)$.\n    - If $\\mu = 0$, the only real solution is again $x^*=0$, so $P_0$ is the only fixed point.\n    - If $\\mu > 0$, there are two real solutions: $x^* = \\sqrt{\\mu}$ and $x^* = -\\sqrt{\\mu}$. This gives rise to two new fixed points: $P_+ = (\\sqrt{\\mu}, \\sqrt{\\mu})$ and $P_- = (-\\sqrt{\\mu}, -\\sqrt{\\mu})$.\n\nIn summary, the system has one fixed point $P_0$ for $\\mu \\le 0$, and three fixed points $P_0, P_+, P_-$ for $\\mu > 0$. The fact that one fixed point splits into three as the parameter $\\mu$ crosses zero is characteristic of a pitchfork bifurcation.\n\nNext, to determine the type of pitchfork bifurcation (supercritical or subcritical), we must analyze the stability of these fixed points.

Substituting this into $\\dot{x} = 0$ yields the scalar equation\n$$\n\\mu \\arctan(x) - x^{3} = 0 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad \\mu \\arctan(x) = x^{3}.\n$$\nBy odd symmetry of $\\arctan$ and of $x^{3}$, the function $G(x;\\mu) \\equiv \\mu \\arctan(x) - x^{3}$ is odd in $x$, so nonzero roots come in symmetric pairs $\\pm x^{\\ast}$. Note that $x=0$ (hence $y=0$) is always a fixed point because $\\arctan(0)=0$.\n\nTo determine the number of fixed points as $\\mu$ varies, analyze the sign of $G$. For $\\mu<0$, for $x>0$ one has $\\mu \\arctan(x)<0$ and $-x^{3}<0$, hence $G(x;\\mu)<0$; for $x<0$, $\\mu \\arctan(x)>0$ and $-x^{3}>0$, hence $G(x;\\mu)>0$. Thus, for $\\mu<0$, the only root is $x=0$. For $\\mu=0$, $G(x;0)=-x^{3}$, again with the only root at $x=0$. For $\\mu>0$, for small $x>0$, $G(x;\\mu)\\approx \\mu x - x^{3}>0$, while for large $x$, $\\arctan(x)$ is bounded and $-x^{3}$ dominates, so $G(x;\\mu)<0$. By continuity, there exists at least one positive root $x^{\\ast}>0$, and by odd symmetry a corresponding negative root. Uniqueness of the positive root follows by monotonicity of $h(x)\\equiv x^{3}/\\arctan(x)$ for $x>0$. Indeed,\n$$\nh'(x) = \\frac{3 x^{2} \\arctan(x) - \\frac{x^{3}}{1+x^{2}}}{\\arctan(x)^{2}} = \\frac{x^{2}\\left(3 \\arctan(x) - \\frac{x}{1+x^{2}}\\right)}{\\arctan(x)^{2}},\n$$\nand for $x\\ge 0$ the inequality $\\arctan(x) \\ge \\frac{x}{1+x^{2}}$ holds because, defining $q(x)=\\arctan(x) - \\frac{x}{1+x^{2}}$, one has $q(0)=0$ and $q'(x)=\\frac{2x^{2}}{(1+x^{2})^{2}}\\ge 0$. Therefore $3 \\arctan(x) - \\frac{x}{1+x^{2}}>0$ for $x>0$, implying $h'(x)>0$ and thus exactly one positive solution to $\\mu = h(x)$. Consequently, the number of fixed points changes from one (only the origin) for $\\mu \\le 0$ to three (the origin and a symmetric pair) for $\\mu>0$.\n\nNext, analyze stability via the Jacobian. The Jacobian matrix at $(x,y)$ is\n$$\nJ(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\mu}{1+x^{2}} & -1 \\\\ 3 x^{2} & -1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nAt the origin $(0,0)$, this reduces to\n$$\nJ(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu & -1 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix},\n$$\nwhose eigenvalues are $\\lambda_{1}=\\mu$ and $\\lambda_{2}=-1$.
