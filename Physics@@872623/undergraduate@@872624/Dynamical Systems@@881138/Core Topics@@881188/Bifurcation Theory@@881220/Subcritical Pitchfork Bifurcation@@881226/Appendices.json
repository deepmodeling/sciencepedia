This means we are looking for the real roots of the cubic polynomial $f(x) = x^3 + rx + h = 0$. The number of real roots of this polynomial depends on the values of the parameters $r$ and $h$.\n\nThe problem states that for a fixed $r0$, there is a critical value of $h$, called $h_c$, at which two of the equilibrium states merge. Kinetically, this is a saddle-node bifurcation. Mathematically, this corresponds to the cubic function $f(x)$ having a repeated root. A function has a repeated root at a point $x_c$ if both the function and its first derivative are zero at that point.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^3 + rx + h) = 3x^2 + r $$\nFor a repeated root to exist at $x = x_c$, we must have $f'(x_c) = 0$.\n$$ 3x_c^2 + r = 0 $$\nSolving for $x_c$, we get:\n$$ 3x_c^2 = -r $$\n$$ x_c^2 = -\\frac{r}{3} $$\nSince the problem states that $r$ is a negative constant, $-r$ is positive, and so $-\\frac{r}{3}$ is also positive. Thus, there are two real solutions for $x_c$:\n$$ x_c = \\pm\\sqrt{-\\frac{r}{3}} $$\nThese two values of $x_c$ are the locations of the local extrema of the function $f(x)$. The merging of equilibrium states occurs when one of these extrema is located on the x-axis, meaning $f(x_c)=0$.\n\nNow we enforce the second condition, $f(x_c) = 0$, for the critical values of $h$, which we denote $h_c$.\n$$ x_c^3 + rx_c + h_c = 0 $$\nWe can solve for $h_c$:\n$$ h_c = -x_c^3 - rx_c = -x_c(x_c^2 + r) $$\nWe already found that at the critical points, $x_c^2 = -r/3$.
