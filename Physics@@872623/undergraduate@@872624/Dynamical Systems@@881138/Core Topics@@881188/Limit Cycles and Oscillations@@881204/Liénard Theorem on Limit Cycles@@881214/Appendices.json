By comparing this general form with the given equation, we can identify the functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$:\n$$ f(x) = x^2 - \\alpha $$\n$$ g(x) = x^3 $$\nLiénard's theorem states that if the following conditions are met, the system has a unique, stable limit cycle.\n\n1.  **Continuity and Differentiability:** The functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ must be continuously differentiable for all $x$. In our case, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are polynomials, which are infinitely differentiable everywhere. This condition is satisfied.\n\n2.  **Properties of $g(x)$:** The function $g(x)$ must be an odd function, i.e., $g(-x) = -g(x)$. Also, $x g(x)  0$ for all $x \\neq 0$.\n    Let's check for $g(x) = x^3$:\n    $g(-x) = (-x)^3 = -x^3 = -g(x)$. So, $g(x)$ is an odd function.\n    For $x \\neq 0$, $x g(x) = x(x^3) = x^4$. Since $x^4$ is always positive for any non-zero real number $x$, this condition is also satisfied.\n\n3.  **Properties of $f(x)$:** The function $f(x)$ must be an even function, i.e., $f(-x) = f(x)$.\n    Let's check for $f(x) = x^2 - \\alpha$:\n    $f(-x) = (-x)^2 - \\alpha = x^2 - \\alpha = f(x)$. So, $f(x)$ is an even function. This condition is satisfied.\n\n4.  **Properties of the Antiderivative of $f(x)$:** Let $F(x) = \\int_0^x f(u) du$. The theorem requires that $F(x)$ has exactly one positive root, say at $x = x_0$. Furthermore, $F(x)$ must be negative for $0  x  x_0$, positive and non-decreasing for $x  x_0$, and $F(x) \\to \\infty$ as $x \\to \\infty$. A key requirement for the instability of the origin is $f(0)  0$.\n    Let's check this set of conditions.\n    First, $f(0) = 0^2 - \\alpha = -\\alpha$. Since the problem states that $\\alpha$ is a positive constant ($\\alpha  0$), we have $f(0)  0$. This ensures the origin is an unstable equilibrium point.\n\n    Next, let's compute $F(x)$:\n    $$ F(x) = \\int_0^x (u^2 - \\alpha) du = \\left[ \\frac{u^3}{3} - \\alpha u \\right]_0^x = \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\alpha x $$\n    To find the roots of $F(x)$, we set it to zero:\n    $$ \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\alpha x = 0 \\implies x\\left(\\frac{x^2}{3} - \\alpha\\right) = 0 $$\n    The roots are $x=0$ and $\\frac{x^2}{3} - \\alpha = 0 \\implies x^2 = 3\\alpha \\implies x = \\pm\\sqrt{3\\alpha}$.\n    Since $\\alpha  0$, $\\sqrt{3\\alpha}$ is a real, positive number. Thus, $F(x)$ has exactly one positive root at $x_0 = \\sqrt{3\\alpha}$.\n\n    Now, we check the sign of $F(x)$. For $0  x  x_0 = \\sqrt{3\\alpha}$, we have $x^2  3\\alpha$, which implies $\\frac{x^2}{3}  \\alpha$. Therefore, for this interval, $F(x) = x\\left(\\frac{x^2}{3} - \\alpha\\right)$ is a product of a positive number ($x$) and a negative number ($\\frac{x^2}{3} - \\alpha$), so $F(x)  0$. This condition is satisfied.\n\n    Next, we check the behavior of $F(x)$ for large $x$.\n    $$ \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} F(x) = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\left(\\frac{x^3}{3} - \\alpha x\\right) = \\infty $$\n    The cubic term dominates, so this condition is satisfied.\n\n    Finally, we must check if $F(x)$ is positive and non-decreasing for $x  x_0 = \\sqrt{3\\alpha}$.\n    For $x  \\sqrt{3\\alpha}$, we have $x^2  3\\alpha$, which implies $\\frac{x^2}{3}  \\alpha$. In this range, $F(x) = x\\left(\\frac{x^2}{3} - \\alpha\\right)$ is a product of two positive numbers, so $F(x)  0$.\n    To be non-decreasing, the derivative of $F(x)$ must be non-negative. The derivative is $F'(x) = f(x) = x^2 - \\alpha$.\n    We need to check if $x^2 - \\alpha \\ge 0$ for all $x  \\sqrt{3\\alpha}$.\n    For $x  \\sqrt{3\\alpha}$, we have $x^2  (\\sqrt{3\\alpha})^2 = 3\\alpha$.\n    Since $\\alpha  0$, it is true that $3\\alpha  \\alpha$.\n    Therefore, for any $x  \\sqrt{3\\alpha}$, we have $x^2  3\\alpha  \\alpha$. This implies $x^2 - \\alpha  0$. So, $F(x)$ is strictly increasing for $x  x_0$. This condition is satisfied.\n\n    Since all conditions of Liénard's theorem are satisfied for any positive value of $\\alpha$, the system is guaranteed to have a unique, stable limit cycle for all $\\alpha  0$.
