Mastering this fundamental skill is the first step toward analyzing any oscillatory or rotational system.", "problem": "A biomedical engineer is designing a novel, non-invasive cardiac monitoring device. The device operates by synchronizing an internal micro-rotor's rotation with the patient's heartbeat, which is detected acoustically. For a particular test subject, the target resting heart rate to be monitored is 82 beats per minute. The device is calibrated such that the micro-rotor completes exactly one full revolution for each detected heartbeat.\n\nCalculate the average angular frequency, $\\omega$, of the micro-rotor required to maintain this synchronization. Express your answer in radians per second (rad/s), rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the average angular frequency $\\omega$ of a micro-rotor that is synchronized with a heart rate.\n\nFirst, let's identify the given frequency. The heart rate is given as a frequency, let's call it $f_{\\text{bpm}}$, in units of beats per minute.\n$$f_{\\text{bpm}} = 82 \\text{ beats/minute}$$\n\nThe problem states that the rotor completes one full revolution for each heartbeat. Therefore, we can interpret the frequency in terms of revolutions per minute.\n$$f_{\\text{rpm}} = 82 \\text{ revolutions/minute}$$\n\nThe standard unit for frequency in physics is Hertz (Hz), which is cycles per second or revolutions per second. We need to convert the unit of time from minutes to seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in one minute, we can perform this conversion.\nLet's denote the frequency in Hz as $f$.\n$$f = 82 \\frac{\\text{revolutions}}{\\text{minute}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ minute}}{60 \\text{ seconds}}$$\n$$f = \\frac{82}{60} \\frac{\\text{revolutions}}{\\text{second}} = \\frac{41}{30} \\text{ Hz}$$\n\nThe quantity we need to find is the angular frequency, $\\omega$. The relationship between angular frequency $\\omega$ (in radians per second) and the linear frequency $f$ (in Hertz or revolutions per second) is given by:\n$$\\omega = 2\\pi f$$\nThis is because one full revolution or cycle corresponds to an angle of $2\\pi$ radians.\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of $f$ we found into this equation.\n$$\\omega = 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{41}{30}\\right) \\text{ rad/s}$$\n$$\\omega = \\frac{82\\pi}{30} \\text{ rad/s} = \\frac{41\\pi}{15} \\text{ rad/s}$$\n\nThe problem requires a numerical answer rounded to three significant figures.

The principle of conservation of angular momentum is a cornerstone of physics, stating that if no external torque acts on a rotating system, its total angular momentum remains constant.
