The state of a particle at step $n+1$, denoted by the coordinate vector $(x_{n+1}, y_{n+1})$, is determined from its state at step $n$, denoted by $(x_n, y_n)$, by the map $F: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$. The map is defined as:\n$$ F(x, y) = (x, -y) $$\nA point $(x_0, y_0)$ is called a fixed point if it remains unchanged after one application of the map, i.e., $F(x_0, y_0) = (x_0, y_0)$. A point is said to have a periodic orbit of period $k$, where $k$ is a positive integer, if it returns to its initial state after exactly $k$ applications of the map.

A fixed point $(x_{0},y_{0})$ satisfies $F(x_{0},y_{0}) = (x_{0},y_{0})$. Substituting the definition of $F$, this condition is\n$$\n(x_{0},-y_{0}) = (x_{0},y_{0}).\n$$\nEquality of ordered pairs implies $x_{0} = x_{0}$ (always true) and $-y_{0} = y_{0}$, which gives $y_{0} = 0$. Therefore, the set of fixed points is exactly all points with $y=0$, i.e., the entire $x$-axis.\n\nNext, consider periodicity of other points. Compute the second iterate:\n$$\nF^{2}(x,y) = F(F(x,y)) = F(x,-y) = (x,y).\n$$\nThus every point satisfies $F^{2}(x,y) = (x,y)$, so every point has period dividing $2$. For points with $y \\ne 0$, we have $F(x,y) = (x,-y) \\ne (x,y)$, so they are not fixed points. Therefore, for all $(x,y)$ with $y \\ne 0$, the minimal period is exactly $2$.\n\nThis behavior matches the statement that the map has a line of fixed points on the $x$-axis, and all other points have period-$2$ orbits.
