We must use the provided Šarkovskii ordering. According to the theorem, if a map has a period $p$, it must also have all periods $q$ such that $p \\succ q$ in the Šarkovskii ordering. In this problem, the given period is $p=14$. We need to find which option $q$ satisfies $14 \\succ q$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the position of the given period, 14, in the Šarkovskii ordering. We can write 14 as a product of a power of 2 and an odd number: $14 = 2 \\cdot 7 = 2^1 \\cdot 7$. This places 14 in the group described in step 2 of the ordering, which is $2^k \\times (\\text{odd integers})$ with $k=1$. The odd part is 7.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option to see if it is preceded by 14 in the ordering. A period $q$ is preceded by $p=14$ if $q$ is in a group that comes later in the list, or if $q$ is in the same group as $p$ but appears after $p$ within that group's internal ordering.\n\nA. The period is 3. This is an odd integer greater than 1. It belongs to the first group described in step 1. The first group ($k=0$) precedes the second group ($k=1$), where 14 is located. Therefore, $3 \\succ 14$. The existence of a period 14 orbit does not imply the existence of a period 3 orbit.\n\nB. The period is 5. This is also an odd integer greater than 1, belonging to the first group. For the same reason as option A, $5 \\succ 14$. This period is not implied by period 14.\n\nC. The period is 6. We decompose it as $6 = 2 \\cdot 3 = 2^1 \\cdot 3$. This places 6 in the same group as 14 (the $k=1$ group). Within this group, the ordering is determined by the odd parts: $3 \\succ 5 \\succ 7 \\succ \\dots$. Since the odd part of 6 is 3 and the odd part of 14 is 7, and $3 \\prec 7$ (as integers), the Šarkovskii ordering is $2 \\cdot 3 \\succ 2 \\cdot 5 \\succ 2 \\cdot 7$. Thus, $6 \\succ 14$. This period is not implied by period 14.\n\nD. The period is 10. We decompose it as $10 = 2 \\cdot 5 = 2^1 \\cdot 5$. Like 6, this period is in the same group as 14. Its odd part is 5. Since $5  7$, we have $2 \\cdot 5 \\succ 2 \\cdot 7$, which means $10 \\succ 14$. This period is not implied by period 14.\n\nE. The period is 12. We decompose it as $12 = 4 \\cdot 3 = 2^2 \\cdot 3$. This places 12 in the group corresponding to $k=2$ (step 3). The given period, 14, is in the group for $k=1$ (step 2). The entire group for $k=1$ precedes the entire group for $k=2$. Therefore, any number in the $k=1$ group, including 14, must precede any number in the $k=2$ group, including 12. So, we have $14 \\succ 12$.

This suggests a function that violates the conditions of Šarkovskii's theorem, which would guarantee a period-3 point if a period-5 point exists for a continuous function. The key is to use the discontinuity to break the topological structure that forces the existence of other periods.\n\nA simple way to create orbits of a specific period is to model a rotation on a circle. A map $g(\\theta) = (\\theta + \\alpha) \\pmod{2\\pi}$ on the circle $[0, 2\\pi)$ can have periodic points. If we identify the interval $[0,1]$ with a circle, we can construct a similar map. Let's consider a map of the form $f(x) = (x + c) \\pmod 1$ for some constant $c$. Such a map has periodic orbits of period $k$ if $k c$ is an integer.\n\nWe want a period-5 point, so we want $5c$ to be an integer. We do not want a period-3 point, so we want $3c$ to *not* be an integer. A simple choice for $c$ that satisfies this is $c = \\frac{2}{5}$. With this choice, $5c = 2$ (an integer), while $3c = \\frac{6}{5}$ (not an integer).\n\nLet's build a function on $[0,1]$ that embodies this idea of \"adding $\\frac{2}{5}$ and taking the result modulo 1\".\nThis can be written as:\n- If $x + \\frac{2}{5}  1$, then $f(x) = x + \\frac{2}{5}$. This holds for $x  1 - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{3}{5}$.\n- If $x + \\frac{2}{5} \\ge 1$, then we subtract 1, so $f(x) = x + \\frac{2}{5} - 1 = x - \\frac{3}{5}$. This holds for $x \\ge \\frac{3}{5}$.\n\nThis leads us to propose the following piecewise function:\n$$\nf(x) = \\begin{cases}\nx + \\frac{2}{5}  \\text{if } 0 \\le x  \\frac{3}{5} \\\\\nx - \\frac{3}{5}  \\text{if } \\frac{3}{5} \\le x \\le 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe codomain of $f(x)$ is $[0,1]$. For the first piece, if $0 \\le x  \\frac{3}{5}$, then $\\frac{2}{5} \\le x + \\frac{2}{5}  1$. For the second piece, if $\\frac{3}{5} \\le x \\le 1$, then $0 \\le x - \\frac{3}{5} \\le \\frac{2}{5}$. So the function indeed maps $[0,1]$ to $[0,1]$.\n\nNow we verify the three given conditions for this function.\n\n**Condition 3: Exactly one point of discontinuity.**\nThe function is defined by two linear expressions. On the open interval $(0, 3/5)$, $f(x)=x+2/5$ is continuous. On the open interval $(3/5, 1)$, $f(x)=x-3/5$ is continuous. The only potential point of discontinuity is at their junction, $x = 3/5$.\nLet's check the left-hand limit and the value of the function at this point.\nThe left-hand limit is:\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to (3/5)^{-}} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to (3/5)^{-}} \\left(x + \\frac{2}{5}\\right) = \\frac{3}{5} + \\frac{2}{5} = 1 $$\nThe function value at $x=3/5$ is given by the second piece:\n$$ f\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) = \\frac{3}{5} - \\frac{3}{5} = 0 $$\nSince $\\lim_{x \\to (3/5)^{-}} f(x) \\neq f(3/5)$, the function is discontinuous at $x = 3/5$. This is the only point of discontinuity. Thus, condition 3 is satisfied.\n\n**Condition 1: Existence of a prime period-5 point.**\nLet's iterate the function starting from $x_0 = 0$ to check for a period-5 orbit.\n$x_0 = 0$\n$x_1 = f(x_0) = f(0) = 0 + \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}$. (since $0  3/5$)\n$x_2 = f(x_1) = f(\\frac{2}{5}) = \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{4}{5}$. (since $2/5  3/5$)\n$x_3 = f(x_2) = f(\\frac{4}{5}) = \\frac{4}{5} - \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{1}{5}$. (since $4/5  3/5$)\n$x_4 = f(x_3) = f(\\frac{1}{5}) = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{3}{5}$. (since $1/5  3/5$)\n$x_5 = f(x_4) = f(\\frac{3}{5}) = \\frac{3}{5} - \\frac{3}{5} = 0 = x_0$.\nThe orbit is $\\{0, \\frac{2}{5}, \\frac{4}{5}, \\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{3}{5}\\}$. These are five distinct points, so $f^5(0) = 0$. Since none of the intermediate iterates $f^k(0)$ for $k=1, 2, 3, 4$ are equal to 0, the point $x_0=0$ has a prime period of 5. Thus, condition 1 is satisfied.\n\n**Condition 2: No points of period 3.**\nWe need to show that there is no $x$ such that $f^3(x)=x$.\nLet $x_i = f^i(x)$. We can express the action of $f$ as $x_{i+1} = (x_i + 2/5) \\pmod 1$. A more formal way is to write:\n$$ x_{i+1} = x_i + \\frac{2}{5} - n_i $$\nwhere $n_i=0$ if $x_i \\in [0, 3/5)$ and $n_i=1$ if $x_i \\in [3/5, 1]$.\nLet's compute $x_3$ in terms of $x_0=x$:\n$$ x_1 = x_0 + \\frac{2}{5} - n_0 $$\n$$ x_2 = x_1 + \\frac{2}{5} - n_1 = \\left(x_0 + \\frac{2}{5} - n_0\\right) + \\frac{2}{5} - n_1 = x_0 + \\frac{4}{5} - n_0 - n_1 $$\n$$ x_3 = x_2 + \\frac{2}{5} - n_2 = \\left(x_0 + \\frac{4}{5} - n_0 - n_1\\right) + \\frac{2}{5} - n_2 = x_0 + \\frac{6}{5} - (n_0 + n_1 + n_2) $$\nIf $f^3(x)=x$, meaning $x_3=x_0$, we must have:\n$$ x_0 = x_0 + \\frac{6}{5} - (n_0 + n_1 + n_2) $$\n$$ \\implies n_0 + n_1 + n_2 = \\frac{6}{5} $$\nHowever, each $n_i$ must be an integer (either 0 or 1). Therefore, their sum $N = n_0 + n_1 + n_2$ must be an integer ($N \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$). Since $\\frac{6}{5}$ is not an integer, there is no sequence of iterations that can satisfy this condition.\nTherefore, there is no $x \\in [0,1]$ such that $f^3(x)=x$.
