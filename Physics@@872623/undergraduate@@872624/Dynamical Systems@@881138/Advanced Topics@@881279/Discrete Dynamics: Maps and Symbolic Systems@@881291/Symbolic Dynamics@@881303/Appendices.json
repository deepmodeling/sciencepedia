A primary goal in studying any dynamical system is to identify its recurring patterns, or periodic orbits. This first practice problem provides essential training in counting these orbits, a foundational skill for quantifying a system's complexity [@problem_id:1712781].", "problem": "Consider a discrete dynamical system whose state at any given time is represented by an infinitely long sequence of symbols. The symbols are drawn from an alphabet $\\mathcal{A} = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$, which contains four distinct symbols. A state is a sequence $s = (s_0 s_1 s_2 \\dots)$, where each entry $s_i$ is a symbol from the alphabet $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\nThe system evolves according to a rule called the full shift map, $\\sigma$. This map acts on a state $s$ by shifting all its symbols one position to the left and discarding the first symbol: $\\sigma(s_0 s_1 s_2 \\dots) = (s_1 s_2 s_3 \\dots)$.\n\nA sequence $s$ is called a periodic point if applying the shift map some number of times returns the original sequence. The smallest positive integer $n$ for which $\\sigma^n(s) = s$ is called the prime period of the sequence. The set of distinct sequences $\\{s, \\sigma(s), \\sigma^2(s), \\dots, \\sigma^{n-1}(s)\\}$ forms a periodic orbit of period $n$.\n\nCalculate the total number of distinct periodic orbits of period 3 for this system.", "solution": "Let the alphabet be $\\mathcal{A}$ and the number of symbols in the alphabet be $k$. In this problem, $k=4$, since $\\mathcal{A} = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. The state of the system is a sequence $s = (s_0 s_1 s_2 \\dots)$, where $s_i \\in \\mathcal{A}$. The dynamics are governed by the shift map $\\sigma(s_0 s_1 s_2 \\dots) = (s_1 s_2 s_3 \\dots)$.\n\nWe are interested in periodic orbits of period 3. First, we find the number of points that are periodic of period 3. A point $s$ is said to be of prime period 3 if $\\sigma^3(s) = s$ and $\\sigma^1(s) \\neq s$. An orbit of period 3 consists of 3 such distinct points.\n\nLet's first identify all sequences $s$ that satisfy the condition $\\sigma^3(s) = s$. Applying the shift map three times gives $\\sigma^3(s_0 s_1 s_2 s_3 \\dots) = (s_3 s_4 s_5 \\dots)$.\nFor $\\sigma^3(s) = s$, we must have $(s_3 s_4 s_5 \\dots) = (s_0 s_1 s_2 \\dots)$. This equality holds if and only if $s_i = s_{i+3}$ for all non-negative integers $i$. This means the sequence is entirely determined by its first three symbols, $(s_0 s_1 s_2)$, which form a repeating block. For example, if $(s_0, s_1, s_2) = (0, 1, 2)$, the sequence is $(0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, \\dots)$.\n\nThe total number of such repeating blocks of length 3 is the number of ways to choose the three symbols $s_0, s_1, s_2$ from the alphabet $\\mathcal{A}$. Since there are $k=4$ choices for each of the three positions, the total number of sequences satisfying $\\sigma^3(s) = s$ is $k^3 = 4^3$.\n$$ N_{\\text{period divides 3}} = 4^3 = 64 $$\nThese 64 sequences are the points whose period *divides* 3. The possible periods are therefore 1 and 3.\n\nTo find the number of points with *prime* period 3, we must subtract the points whose period is a proper divisor of 3. The only proper divisor of 3 is 1. A point with period 1 is a fixed point, satisfying $\\sigma(s) = s$.\nLet's find the number of fixed points. The condition $\\sigma(s) = s$ means $(s_1 s_2 s_3 \\dots) = (s_0 s_1 s_2 \\dots)$. This holds if and only if $s_i = s_{i+1}$ for all $i \\ge 0$, which implies $s_0 = s_1 = s_2 = \\dots$. The sequence must be constant. Since there are $k=4$ symbols in the alphabet, there are 4 such constant sequences: $(0,0,0,\\dots)$, $(1,1,1,\\dots)$, $(2,2,2,\\dots)$, and $(3,3,3,\\dots)$.\nThe number of fixed points (points of period 1) is therefore $k^1 = 4^1 = 4$.\n$$ N_{\\text{period is 1}} = 4^1 = 4 $$\nThese 4 points are included in the 64 points we counted earlier, because if $\\sigma^1(s) = s$, then it is also true that $\\sigma^3(s) = \\sigma^2(\\sigma(s)) = \\sigma^2(s) = \\sigma(\\sigma(s)) = \\sigma(s) = s$.\n\nThe number of points of prime period 3 is the total number of points whose period divides 3 minus the number of points whose period is 1.\n$$ N_{\\text{prime period 3}} = N_{\\text{period divides 3}} - N_{\\text{period is 1}} = k^3 - k^1 = 4^3 - 4^1 = 64 - 4 = 60 $$\nSo, there are 60 distinct sequences that have a prime period of 3.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of distinct periodic *orbits* of period 3. By definition, an orbit of period 3 contains 3 distinct points. For example, the point $s = (0,1,2,0,1,2,\\dots)$ has prime period 3. Its orbit is the set:\n$$ \\{ (0,1,2,0,1,2,\\dots), \\sigma(s) = (1,2,0,1,2,0,\\dots), \\sigma^2(s) = (2,0,1,2,0,1,\\dots) \\} $$\nThese three points are distinct. Any point of prime period 3 will belong to an orbit with 3 distinct points. Therefore, to find the number of orbits, we must group the 60 points of prime period 3 into sets of 3.\n\nThe number of orbits of period 3 is the number of points of prime period 3 divided by the period length, 3.\n$$ \\text{Number of orbits of period 3} = \\frac{N_{\\text{prime period 3}}}{3} = \\frac{60}{3} = 20 $$\nThus, there are 20 distinct periodic orbits of period 3.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{20}$$", "id": "1712781"}, {"introduction": "Not all sequences exhibit immediate repetition. This next exercise introduces the important distinction between sequences that are periodic from the start and those that only settle into a repeating pattern after an initial, non-repeating phase.

Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\nThe sequence is $s = (1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, \\dots)$.\nThis sequence contains blocks of zeros that increase in length: one 0, then two 0s, then three 0s, and so on. A periodic sequence must have a repeating block of a fixed finite length $p$. Since the blocks of zeros in $s$ grow indefinitely, no such fixed-length repeating block exists. Thus, $s$ is not periodic.\nNow consider any shifted sequence $\\sigma^k(s)$. For any finite number of shifts $k$, the tail of the sequence $\\sigma^k(s)$ will still contain blocks of zeros of increasing length. Therefore, no shifted sequence $\\sigma^k(s)$ can be periodic. The sequence is not eventually periodic. Thus, option B is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThe sequence is $s = (2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, \\dots)$.\nFirst, we check if $s$ is periodic. The sequence from the second term onward is $(0, 1, 0, 1, \\dots)$, which is a periodic pattern with period 2. However, the first term is $s_0=2$. If the sequence were periodic with period 2, we would need $s_0=s_2$, but $s_0=2$ and $s_2=1$. So, $s_0 \\neq s_2$. The unique first term prevents the sequence from being periodic. Thus, $s$ is not periodic.\nNext, let's apply the shift map once:\n$\\sigma(s) = \\sigma((2, 0, 1, 0, 1, \\dots)) = (0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, \\dots)$.\nThe resulting sequence $\\sigma(s)$ is periodic with period 2, since its terms alternate between 0 and 1.\nSince $\\sigma^1(s)$ is periodic, the sequence $s$ is eventually periodic with a transient part of length $k=1$. The problem asks for a transient part of length 2. Thus, option C is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nThe sequence is $s = (1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, \\dots)$.\nFirst, we check if $s$ is periodic. The sequence from the third term onward is $(2, 0, 2, 0, \\dots)$, which is a periodic pattern with period 2. Let's test if the whole sequence $s$ is periodic with period 2. We must have $s_n = s_{n+2}$ for all $n \\ge 0$. However, $s_0=1$ and $s_2=2$, so $s_0 \\neq s_2$. Thus, $s$ is not periodic with period 2. It cannot be periodic with any other period either, as any repeating block would need to accommodate the initial non-repeating part $(1,1)$ and the repeating tail $(2,0,\\dots)$, which is impossible. So, $s$ is not periodic. This satisfies the first condition.\nNext, we apply the shift map once:\n$\\sigma(s) = \\sigma((1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 0, \\dots)) = (1, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, \\dots)$.\nLet's check if $\\sigma(s)$ is periodic. The tail of this new sequence is $(2, 0, 2, 0, \\dots)$, but its first term is 1. Let's test for period 2. The first term is $(\\sigma(s))_0 = 1$ and the third term is $(\\sigma(s))_2 = 0$. Since $(\\sigma(s))_0 \\neq (\\sigma(s))_2$, the sequence $\\sigma(s)$ is not periodic with period 2. It is not periodic with any other period due to the unique leading term '1'. So, $\\sigma(s)$ is not periodic. This satisfies the second condition.\nFinally, we apply the shift map a second time:\n$\\sigma^2(s) = \\sigma(\\sigma(s)) = \\sigma((1, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, \\dots)) = (2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, \\dots)$.\nThe resulting sequence $\\sigma^2(s)$ consists of the block $(2,0)$ repeating indefinitely. It is periodic with period 2. This satisfies the third condition.\nSince $s$ is not periodic and $\\sigma(s)$ is not periodic, but $\\sigma^2(s)$ is periodic, the sequence $s$ is eventually periodic and the length of its transient part is exactly 2.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1712808"}, {"introduction": "We now move from analyzing individual sequences to classifying the global properties of an entire system, specifically a subshift of finite type.
