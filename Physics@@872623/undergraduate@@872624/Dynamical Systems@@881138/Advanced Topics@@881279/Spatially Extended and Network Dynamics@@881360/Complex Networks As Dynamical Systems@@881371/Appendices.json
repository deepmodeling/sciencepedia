A self-propagating malware is spreading through this network. Each server can be in one of two states: 'healthy' (Susceptible) or 'compromised' (Infected). This dynamic can be described by a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model.\n\nThe process of infection and recovery is governed by the following rules:\n- A compromised server can infect a healthy server it is connected to. The per-contact infection rate is a constant, $\\beta$.\n- A compromised server can be automatically cleaned and returned to a healthy state. The recovery rate for any compromised server is a constant, $\\gamma$. Both $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ have units of inverse time.\n\nWe can analyze this system using a mean-field approach. Let $p(t)$ be the time-dependent probability that any single server is in the compromised state. Due to the complete symmetry of the network, a single equation for $p(t)$ is sufficient to describe the overall prevalence of the malware.\n\nThe system exhibits a critical phenomenon known as an epidemic threshold. Below a certain critical value of the infection rate, the malware will always die out, leaving the network completely healthy ($p=0$). Above this threshold, a stable state with a non-zero fraction of compromised servers ($p>0$) becomes possible.\n\nYour task is to determine the critical infection rate, $\\beta_c$, as a function of the recovery rate $\\gamma$.", "solution": "We model the SIS dynamics on a complete graph of three servers using a homogeneous mean-field approximation. Let $p(t)$ denote the probability that a given server is compromised at time $t$. Each server has degree $k=2$ because it is connected to the other two servers.\n\nThe infection process contributes a gain term to $p(t)$: a server must be susceptible with probability $1-p$, and it can be infected by any of its $k$ neighbors, each of which is compromised with probability $p$. Under the mean-field independence assumption, the expected number of compromised neighbors is $k p$, and infection along each edge occurs at rate $\\beta$. Thus the infection inflow is $\\beta k p (1-p)$.\n\nRecovery contributes a loss term: a compromised server recovers at rate $\\gamma$, yielding an outflow $\\gamma p$.\n\nTherefore, the mean-field equation is\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt}=\\beta k\\,p\\,(1-p)-\\gamma p.\n$$\nThe fixed points satisfy\n$$\n0=\\beta k\\,p\\,(1-p)-\\gamma p=p\\left(\\beta k(1-p)-\\gamma\\right),\n$$\nso either $p=0$ or\n$$\n\\beta k(1-p)-\\gamma=0\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad p^{\\ast}=1-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta k}.\n$$\nA nonzero steady state $p^{\\ast}>0$ exists only if $\\beta k>\\gamma$.

The network is modeled as a complete graph $K_N$, where every oscillator is connected to every other oscillator. The dynamics of each oscillator node are governed by a discrete-time map, and their interaction is mediated by a diffusive coupling. The goal is to stabilize the entire network to a specific unstable equilibrium state, $s^*$, by applying a pinning control strategy.\n\nThe control strategy involves \"pinning\" a subset of $m$ nodes. A pinned node $i$ receives an additional feedback signal $u_i = -K(x_i - s^*)$, where $x_i$ is the state of node $i$ and $K$ is a constant positive control gain. The unpinned nodes do not receive this direct feedback.\n\nFrom the theory of network control, it is known that for this particular system, global synchronization to the state $s^*$ is achieved if and only if the smallest eigenvalue of a specially constructed matrix, $G = \\sigma L + KB$, is strictly greater than a critical threshold, $\\gamma_{crit}$.
