This system is measure-preserving with respect to the Lebesgue measure, and the space has finite measure $\\mu(X)=1$. However, this system is known to be ergodic (and even mixing).

It is a classic example of a system that is ergodic. For any starting point $x_0$, the orbit $\\{T^n(x_0)\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is dense in $[0, 1)$.

The transformation $T$ is defined as two separate irrational rotations on each disjoint component. An irrational rotation on an interval is measure-preserving. Since $T$ maps $[0, 1)$ to itself and $[2, 3)$ to itself, the transformation is measure-preserving on the whole space $X$. So, the conditions of the Poincaré Recurrence Theorem are met.\nLet's consider the set $S = [0, 1)$. The map is defined such that if $x \\in S$, then $T(x) \\in S$. This means $S$ is an invariant set. The measure of this set is $\\mu(S) = 1$. The measure of the whole space is $\\mu(X) = 2$. Since $0  \\mu(S) = 1  \\mu(X) = 2$, the system is not ergodic. We can construct our counterexample based on this invariant set. Let's choose $A$ to be any subset of $[0, 1)$ with positive measure, for example, $A = [0, 0.1)$. Let's choose $B$ to be any subset of $[2, 3)$ with positive measure, for example, $B = [2, 2.1)$.

Its measure is $\\mu(S) = b-a$. The preimage is $T^{-1}(S) = \\{x \\in [0, 1) | a \\le x^2  b\\} = [\\sqrt{a}, \\sqrt{b})$. The measure of the preimage is $\\mu(T^{-1}(S)) = \\sqrt{b} - \\sqrt{a}$.
