But what makes a system \"ergodic\"? This practice moves beyond mere calculation to build an intuition for this crucial property. Through a hypothetical scenario involving a particle on an interval, you will explore the conditions under which a system cannot be confined to any smaller subset of its state space, which is the very essence of ergodicity [@problem_id:1686103].", "problem": "A particle is confined to move along a one-dimensional interval $[0, 1]$. The particle moves at a constant, non-zero speed. When the particle reaches a boundary (either at $x=0$ or $x=1$), one of two things happens:\n1.  With probability $p$, the particle undergoes a specular reflection, meaning its velocity is reversed, and it moves back into the interval.\n2.  With probability $1-p$, the particle is instantly repositioned to a new location $x'$ chosen from a uniform random distribution over the entire interval $[0, 1]$. The new velocity is then randomly assigned to be either towards $x=1$ or towards $x=0$ with equal probability.\n\nThe process is said to be ergodic with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $[0,1]$ if the only measurable subsets of $[0,1]$ that are invariant under the particle's evolution have a measure of either 0 or 1.

A measurable set $S\\subset[0,1]$ is invariant by the given definition if, for every initial position $x\\in S$, the trajectory remains in $S$ for all future times with probability one.\n\nFirst, suppose $0\\le p1$. Consider any measurable $S$ with $0m(S)1$ and assume, toward a contradiction, that $S$ is invariant. Fix any initial position $x\\in S$ (and any initial velocity direction). Because the speed is constant and nonzero, the particle reaches a boundary in finite time. At each boundary hit, with probability $1-p0$, the particle is uniformly repositioned in $[0,1]$ and assigned a random direction. Let $N$ be the (random) number of specular reflections before the first uniform repositioning. Then $N$ is geometrically distributed with parameter $1-p$, so\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(N\\infty)=1.\n$$\nHence, with probability one, a uniform repositioning occurs at some finite time $\\tau$. At that instant, the new position $X_{\\tau}$ is uniform on $[0,1]$, so\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(X_{\\tau}\\in S)=m(S),\\qquad \\mathbb{P}(X_{\\tau}\\notin S)=1-m(S).\n$$\nBecause $0m(S)1$, we have $\\mathbb{P}(X_{\\tau}\\notin S)0$. Therefore, starting from $x\\in S$, there is a strictly positive probability that the process exits $S$ at time $\\tau$, contradicting the requirement that the trajectory remain in $S$ with probability one. This contradiction shows that no measurable $S$ with $0m(S)1$ can be invariant when $p1$. Consequently, for all $p$ with $0\\le p1$, the only invariant sets have measure $0$ or $1$, so the process is ergodic.\n\nNext, consider $p=1$. In this case, there is never a uniform repositioning: the motion is purely deterministic with specular reflections. Then the process admits nontrivial structure that prevents ergodicity under the stated notion: the dynamics conserve the order along the unfolded line and contain no stochastic mixing. In particular, the evolution is fully deterministic and does not randomize positions; hence one can construct nontrivial invariant events in the associated dynamical system (for example, events determined by the direction of motion, which is conserved between reflections and never randomized when $p=1$). This breaks ergodicity in the sense that the invariant sigma-field is nontrivial. Therefore the process is not ergodic for $p=1$.\n\nCombining these conclusions, the process is ergodic precisely for $0\\le p1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1686103"}]}
