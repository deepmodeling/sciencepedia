The origin is not necessarily a hyperbolic fixed point for $h(x)$; it can be non-hyperbolic for certain choices of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.", "solution": "First, we must verify that the origin, $x=0$, is indeed a fixed point for the composite map $h(x) = f(g(x))$.\nThe problem statement specifies that $x=0$ is a fixed point for both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. This means:\n$g(0) = 0$\n$f(0) = 0$\nTo check if $x=0$ is a fixed point for $h(x)$, we evaluate $h(0)$:\n$h(0) = f(g(0)) = f(0) = 0$.\nSince $h(0) = 0$, the origin is a fixed point for the composite map $h(x)$.\n\nNext, to determine the stability and hyperbolicity of this fixed point, we need to analyze the derivative of $h(x)$ at $x=0$. We can find the derivative of $h(x)$ using the chain rule:\n$h'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}f(g(x)) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\n\nNow, we evaluate this derivative at the fixed point $x=0$:\n$h'(0) = f'(g(0)) \\cdot g'(0)$.\nSince $g(0) = 0$, we can substitute this into the expression:\n$h'(0) = f'(0) \\cdot g'(0)$.\n\nThe problem provides information about the derivatives of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ at the origin.\n1. For the map $f(x)$, the origin is a hyperbolic expanding fixed point. By definition, this means $|f'(0)| > 1$.\n2. For the map $g(x)$, the origin is a hyperbolic contracting fixed point. By definition, this means $|g'(0)|  1$.\n\nThe fixed point $x=0$ for the map $h(x)$ is hyperbolic if $|h'(0)| \\neq 1$. Let's examine the magnitude of $h'(0)$:\n$|h'(0)| = |f'(0) \\cdot g'(0)| = |f'(0)| \\cdot |g'(0)|$.\n\nWe have a product of two numbers: $|f'(0)|$, which is greater than 1, and $|g'(0)|$, which is less than 1 (and non-negative). The question is whether this product is necessarily not equal to 1.\n\nLet's consider a specific counterexample to test if $|h'(0)|$ can be equal to 1.\nLet $|f'(0)| = \\alpha$ where $\\alpha > 1$.\nLet $|g'(0)| = \\beta$ where $0 \\le \\beta  1$.\nThen $|h'(0)| = \\alpha \\beta$.\n\nIs it possible for $\\alpha \\beta = 1$? Yes, if we choose $\\beta = 1/\\alpha$. Since $\\alpha > 1$, we have $0  1/\\alpha  1$, which is a valid value for $\\beta$.\n\nLet's construct explicit functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ that satisfy the problem's conditions but result in a non-hyperbolic fixed point for $h(x)$.\nChoose $f(x) = 2x$.\n- This has a fixed point at $x=0$ since $f(0) = 2(0) = 0$.\n- The derivative is $f'(x) = 2$.\n- At the origin, $|f'(0)| = |2| = 2$, which is greater than 1. So, $x=0$ is a hyperbolic expanding fixed point for $f(x)$.\n\nChoose $g(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x$.\n- This has a fixed point at $x=0$ since $g(0) = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$.\n- The derivative is $g'(x) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- At the origin, $|g'(0)| = |\\frac{1}{2}| = 0.5$, which is less than 1. So, $x=0$ is a hyperbolic contracting fixed point for $g(x)$.\n\nNow, we construct the composite map $h(x) = f(g(x))$:\n$h(x) = f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right) = x$.\n\nFor this composite map $h(x) = x$, the derivative is $h'(x) = 1$.\nAt the fixed point $x=0$, the derivative is $h'(0) = 1$.\nThe magnitude of the derivative is $|h'(0)| = |1| = 1$.\n\nBy definition, a fixed point is non-hyperbolic if the magnitude of the derivative at that point is exactly 1. In this case, we have found a valid pair of functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ for which the fixed point of the composite map $h(x)$ is non-hyperbolic.\n\nTherefore, the origin is not necessarily a hyperbolic fixed point for $h(x)$. It can be hyperbolic (e.g., if $f(x)=3x$ and $g(x)=x/2$, then $|h'(0)|=3/2 > 1$) or non-hyperbolic, as shown by the counterexample.
