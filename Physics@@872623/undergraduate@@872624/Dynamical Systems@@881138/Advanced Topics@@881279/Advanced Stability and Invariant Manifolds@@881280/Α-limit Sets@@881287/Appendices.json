We can solve this by first analyzing the behavior of a single trajectory starting in $S$ and then extending this result to the entire set $S$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the system of differential equations:\n$$x' = 0$$\n$$y' = y(1-y)$$\n\nThe first equation, $x' = \\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$, can be integrated directly. For a trajectory starting at a point $(x_0, y_0)$, we have $x(t) = x_0$ for all time $t$. This means that motion only occurs in the $y$-direction, and the $x$-coordinate of any point on a trajectory remains constant.\n\nThe second equation, $y' = \\frac{dy}{dt} = y(1-y)$, is the logistic equation. To understand its behavior, we find its equilibrium points by setting $y' = 0$. This gives $y(1-y)=0$, which yields two equilibria: $y=0$ and $y=1$. These are horizontal lines of fixed points in the $(x,y)$-plane.\n\nTo determine the stability of these equilibria, we can analyze the sign of $y'$ in the intervals between them:\n- If $y > 1$, then $y' = y(1-y)  0$, so $y(t)$ decreases towards $y=1$.\n- If $0  y  1$, then $y' = y(1-y) > 0$, so $y(t)$ increases towards $y=1$.\n- If $y  0$, then $y' = y(1-y)  0$, so $y(t)$ decreases towards $-\\infty$.\n\nThe $\\alpha$-limit set concerns the behavior of trajectories as $t \\to -\\infty$. This is the reverse of the direction of the flow described above.\n\nLet's consider an arbitrary point $p = (x_0, y_0)$ belonging to the set $S$. According to the definition of $S$, we have $0  x_0  2$ and $y_0 = 1/3$. Since $0  y_0  1$, our analysis of the $y$-dynamics shows that as time $t$ increases, $y(t)$ will approach the stable equilibrium $y=1$. Conversely, as time $t$ goes to negative infinity ($t \\to -\\infty$), the trajectory must have originated from the unstable equilibrium $y=0$. Thus, for an initial condition $y_0$ in the interval $(0, 1)$, we have:\n$$\\lim_{t \\to -\\infty} y(t) = 0$$\n\nCombining the behavior of both coordinates, a trajectory starting at $p = (x_0, y_0)$ is given by $\\phi_t(p) = (x(t), y(t)) = (x_0, y(t))$. As $t \\to -\\infty$, the trajectory approaches the point $(x_0, 0)$:\n$$\\lim_{t \\to -\\infty} \\phi_t(p) = \\left( \\lim_{t \\to -\\infty} x(t), \\lim_{t \\to -\\infty} y(t) \\right) = (x_0, 0)$$\nTherefore, the $\\alpha$-limit set for a single point $p=(x_0, 1/3)$ in $S$ is the singleton set $\\alpha(p) = \\{(x_0, 0)\\}$.\n\nNow, we need to find the $\\alpha$-limit set of the entire segment $S$, which is defined as $\\alpha(S) = \\bigcup_{p \\in S} \\alpha(p)$. The set $S$ consists of all points $(x_0, 1/3)$ where $x_0$ is in the open interval $(0, 2)$.\nWe take the union of the individual $\\alpha$-limit sets for all points in $S$:\n$$\\alpha(S) = \\bigcup_{p \\in S} \\alpha(p) = \\bigcup_{(x_0, 1/3) \\in S} \\{(x_0, 0)\\}$$\nSince $x_0$ can be any value in $(0,2)$, this union is the set of all points $(x, 0)$ where $0  x  2$.\nIn set notation, this is:\n$$\\alpha(S) = \\{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid 0  x  2 \\text{ and } y = 0\\}$$\n\nThis corresponds to the open line segment on the x-axis between $x=0$ and $x=2$. Comparing this result with the given choices:\n- A. The set of points $\\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid 0  x  2 \\text{ and } y = 0\\}$. This matches our result.\n- B. This is the $\\omega$-limit set of $S$, describing the behavior as $t \\to +\\infty$.\n- C. This set includes the endpoints $x=0$ and $x=2$, which is incorrect because the initial set $S$ is open in $x$, and the $x$-coordinate is constant along trajectories.\n- D.
