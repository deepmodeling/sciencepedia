The set of all initial conditions that lead to such trajectories constitutes the stable manifold of the origin, which is the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues with negative real parts.\n\nFirst, we find the eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1-\\lambda  1 \\\\ 2  -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\n$$\n(1-\\lambda)(-\\lambda) - (1)(2) = 0\n$$\n$$\n-\\lambda + \\lambda^2 - 2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda^2 - \\lambda - 2 = 0\n$$\nThis quadratic equation can be factored as:\n$$\n(\\lambda - 2)(\\lambda + 1) = 0\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = -1$.\n\nThe trajectory approaches the origin only if it lies in the eigenspace associated with the negative eigenvalue.

This eigenspace is the stable manifold, which is a line.\n\nNext, we find the eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = -1$ by solving the equation $(A - \\lambda_2 I)\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{0}$.\n$$\n(A - (-1)I)\\mathbf{v}_2 = (A+I)\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1+1  1 \\\\ 2  0+1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 2  1 \\\\ 2  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix equation gives the single independent linear equation:\n$$\n2v_x + v_y = 0\n$$\nThis implies that $v_y = -2v_x$. We can choose a simple non-zero vector that satisfies this condition. For example, if we let $v_x = 1$, then $v_y = -2$. So, an eigenvector for $\\lambda_2 = -1$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe stable manifold is the line passing through the origin that is spanned by this eigenvector.
