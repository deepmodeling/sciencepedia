To analyze the long-term behavior of this system, we can study the evolution of a scalar function $V(x, y)$ along the system's trajectories.

The origin is globally asymptotically stable.\n\nD. The origin is unstable.\n\nE. The stability of the origin cannot be determined using standard analysis techniques.", "solution": "To determine the stability of the equilibrium point at the origin $(0,0)$, we will use a Lyapunov function approach combined with LaSalle's Invariance Principle.\n\nFirst, we define a candidate Lyapunov function $V(x,y)$. For systems that resemble mechanical oscillators, a good choice is a function analogous to the total energy (kinetic + potential). The term $-y$ in the $\\dot{y}$ equation acts as a damping term, and the term $-x^5$ acts as a restoring force. The \"kinetic energy\" can be associated with $\\frac{1}{2}y^2$ (since $\\dot{x}=y$), and the \"potential energy\" can be found by integrating the conservative part of the force, $F(x) = -x^5$. The potential energy $U(x)$ is such that $-\\frac{dU}{dx} = F(x)$, so $U(x) = \\int_0^x s^5 \\,ds = \\frac{x^6}{6}$.\n\nLet's choose the Lyapunov function candidate as the sum of these \"energy\" terms:\n$$\nV(x,y) = \\frac{1}{6}x^6 + \\frac{1}{2}y^2\n$$\n\nWe must verify the properties of this function.\n1.  $V(0,0) = \\frac{1}{6}(0)^6 + \\frac{1}{2}(0)^2 = 0$.\n2.  For any point $(x,y) \\neq (0,0)$, either $x \\neq 0$ or $y \\neq 0$. Since $x^6 \\geq 0$ and $y^2 \\geq 0$, their sum $V(x,y)$ is positive for any $(x,y) \\neq (0,0)$. Thus, $V(x,y)$ is a positive definite function.\n3.  As the norm of the state vector, $\\|(x,y)\\| = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$, approaches infinity, at least one of $|x|$ or $|y|$ must approach infinity. This implies that $V(x,y)$ also approaches infinity. Therefore, $V(x,y)$ is radially unbounded. This property is crucial for concluding global stability.\n\nNext, we calculate the time derivative of $V(x,y)$ along the trajectories of the system. Using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}\\frac{dx}{dt} + \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y}\\frac{dy}{dt}\n$$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} = x^5\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} = y\n$$\nSubstituting these and the system equations ($\\dot{x}=y$, $\\dot{y}=-x^5-y$) into the expression for $\\dot{V}$:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x,y) = (x^5)(y) + (y)(-x^5 - y) = x^5y - x^5y - y^2\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x,y) = -y^2\n$$\nSince $\\dot{V}(x,y) = -y^2 \\leq 0$ for all $(x,y)$, the function is negative semi-definite. The Lyapunov stability theorem implies that the origin is at least stable. To determine if it is asymptotically stable, we must check if there are any trajectories other than the origin itself where $\\dot{V} \\equiv 0$.\n\nWe apply LaSalle's Invariance Principle. Let $E$ be the set of all points where $\\dot{V}(x,y)=0$.\n$$\nE = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid \\dot{V}(x,y) = 0\\}\n$$\nIn our case, $\\dot{V}(x,y) = -y^2 = 0$, which implies $y=0$. So, the set $E$ is the entire x-axis.\n\nNow, we need to find the largest invariant set, $M$, contained within $E$. An invariant set is a set of points such that any trajectory starting in the set remains in the set for all future time. For a trajectory to remain in $E$, it must satisfy $y(t) = 0$ for all $t$.\nIf $y(t)=0$ for all $t$, then its derivative must also be zero, i.e., $\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0$.\nWe now look at the system's dynamics for points within $E$:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = -x^5 - y\n$$\nFor a trajectory to stay in $E$, we must have $y=0$ and $\\frac{dy}{dt}=0$. Substituting these conditions into the equation gives:\n$$\n0 = -x^5 - 0 \\implies x^5 = 0 \\implies x=0\n$$\nThis means the only point that can remain in the set $E$ for all time is the point where $x=0$ and $y=0$, which is the origin itself.\nThus, the largest invariant set $M$ contained in $E$ is simply the singleton set $\\{(0,0)\\}$.\n\nLaSalle's Invariance Principle states that every solution starting in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ converges to the largest invariant set $M \\subseteq E$. Since $V(x,y)$ is radially unbounded, this applies to all initial conditions. Therefore, all trajectories converge to the origin as $t \\to \\infty$. This means the origin is globally asymptotically stable.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nLet's quickly analyze why other options are incorrect:\nA. The analysis shows asymptotic stability, not just stability. This is what LaSalle's principle adds beyond the basic Lyapunov theorem for semi-definite derivatives.\nB. The radial unboundedness of $V(x,y)$ allows us to extend the conclusion from local to global, so this option is incorrect.\nD. The system is clearly not unstable.\nE. Standard analysis techniques (Lyapunov theory and LaSalle's principle) are sufficient to determine the stability. Linearization at the origin yields a system matrix with eigenvalues $0$ and $-1$, a critical case where linearization is inconclusive, but this does not mean stability cannot be determined by other means.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1689532"}, {"introduction": "This final practice problem [@problem_id:1689535] showcases the full power of LaSalle's Invariance Principle by moving beyond convergence to a single equilibrium point.

On the set $\\{r=a\\}$ we have $\\gamma(a)=0$ and the dynamics reduce to the undamped isotropic oscillator $\\ddot{\\mathbf{r}}=-\\mathbf{r}$. The only motions that remain on $r=a$ for all time are those with $r(t)\\equiv a$ and purely tangential velocity supporting uniform circular motion. Indeed, for a circular motion with constant radius $a$ and angular speed $\\omega$, one has $\\ddot{\\mathbf{r}}=-\\omega^{2}\\mathbf{r}$ and $|\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}|=a|\\omega|$. Substituting into $\\ddot{\\mathbf{r}}=-\\mathbf{r}$ on $r=a$ yields $-\\omega^{2}\\mathbf{r}=-\\mathbf{r}$, hence $\\omega^{2}=1$ and therefore $|\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}|=a$. Any nonuniform motion on $r=a$ would violate $\\ddot{\\mathbf{r}}=-\\mathbf{r}$ with $r$ constant and thus leave $\\{r=a\\}$, which then gives $\\dot{E}0$; hence it is not invariant.

Conversely, initial data exactly on a uniform circular motion remain there, and there exist initial conditions that converge to one of these circular motions. Therefore, the complete set of possible asymptotic behaviors consists exactly of convergence either to rest at the origin or to uniform circular motion of radius $a$ with speed $a$. This rules out:\n- A: false because initial data on a uniform circle do not converge to the origin.\n- B: false because trajectories with $E(0)  a^{2}$ cannot reach the circle (energy cannot increase).\n- D: false because any motion confined to $r=a$ must be uniform circular as shown.\n- E: false because $E$ is strictly Lyapunov (nonincreasing), so trajectories cannot exhibit chaotic wandering and must approach the invariant set.\n\nHence the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1689535"}]}
