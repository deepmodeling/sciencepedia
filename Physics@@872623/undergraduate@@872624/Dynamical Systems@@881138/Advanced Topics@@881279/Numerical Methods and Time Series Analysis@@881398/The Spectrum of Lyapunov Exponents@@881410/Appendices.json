This foundational exercise will guide you through the direct application of the definition of the Lyapunov exponent. By calculating it for the map $x_{n+1} = a x_n$, you will build a crucial intuition connecting the exponent's sign and magnitude to the fundamental actions of stretching ($|a| > 1$) and contracting ($|a|  1$) that underpin all of dynamics [@problem_id:1721705].", "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional discrete-time dynamical system described by the linear map $x_{n+1} = a x_n$, where $x_n$ is the state of the system at time step $n$ and $a$ is a non-zero real constant. Assume the initial state is $x_0 \\neq 0$.\n\nThe long-term rate of exponential divergence or convergence of nearby trajectories is characterized by the Lyapunov exponent, $\\lambda$. For a general one-dimensional map $x_{n+1} = f(x_n)$, the Lyapunov exponent is calculated from an initial state $x_0$ using the formula:\n$$ \\lambda(x_0) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\ln |f'(x_i)| $$\nwhere $f'(x_i)$ is the derivative of the map function $f(x)$ evaluated at the state $x_i$ of the trajectory.\n\nCalculate the Lyapunov exponent for the given linear map $x_{n+1} = a x_n$. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of the constant $a$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the calculation of the Lyapunov exponent for the map $x_{n+1} = ax_n$.\n\nFirst, we identify the function $f(x)$ that defines the map. In this case, the map is given by $x_{n+1} = f(x_n)$, so we have:\n$$ f(x) = ax $$\n\nNext, we need to find the derivative of this function, $f'(x)$, with respect to $x$.\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(ax) = a $$\nWe observe that the derivative is a constant, $a$.

Therefore, the sum is simply $n$ times the constant term:\n$$ \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\ln |a| = n \\cdot \\ln |a| $$\n\nWe substitute this result back into the expression for the Lyapunov exponent:\n$$ \\lambda(x_0) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} (n \\ln |a|) $$\n\nThe factor of $n$ in the numerator and the denominator cancels out:\n$$ \\lambda(x_0) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\ln |a| $$\n\nSince $\\ln|a|$ is a constant (it does not depend on $n$), the limit of the constant is the constant itself:\n$$ \\lambda(x_0) = \\ln|a| $$\n\nThis result shows that for the linear map $x_{n+1} = ax_n$, the Lyapunov exponent is independent of the initial state $x_0$ (as long as $x_0 \\neq 0$).
