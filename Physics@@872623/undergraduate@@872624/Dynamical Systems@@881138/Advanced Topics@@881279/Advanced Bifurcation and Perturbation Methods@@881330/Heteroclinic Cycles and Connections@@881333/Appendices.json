This gives the equilibrium point $P_2 = (0, 0.5)$.\n\nCase 3: Intersection of $y=0$ and $y = 1-x$.\nSubstituting $y=0$ gives $0 = 1 - x \\implies x=1$. This gives the equilibrium point $P_3 = (1, 0)$.\n\nCase 4: Intersection of $y = 1-x$ and $y = 0.5-x$.\nSetting the expressions for $y$ equal: $1-x = 0.5-x$, which simplifies to $1 = 0.5$. This is a contradiction, so there is no interior equilibrium point where both $x0$ and $y0$.\n\nThe three equilibrium points are $(0, 0)$, $(0, 0.5)$, and $(1, 0)$.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the stability of the equilibrium points**\nWe use linearization by computing the Jacobian matrix $J(x,y)$:\n$$\nJ(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1-2x-y  -x \\\\ -y  0.5-2y-x \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow we evaluate the Jacobian at each equilibrium point to find the eigenvalues.\n\n-   At $P_1 = (0, 0)$:\n    $J(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  0.5 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 0.5$. Since both are positive, $P_1$ is an **unstable node**.\n\n-   At $P_2 = (0, 0.5)$:\n    $J(0, 0.5) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1-0.5  0 \\\\ -0.5  0.5-2(0.5)-0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.5  0 \\\\ -0.5  -0.5 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    This is a lower triangular matrix, so the eigenvalues are the diagonal entries: $\\lambda_1 = 0.5$ and $\\lambda_2 = -0.5$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, $P_2$ is a **saddle point**.\n\n-   At $P_3 = (1, 0)$:\n    $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1-2(1)-0  -1 \\\\ -0  0.5-0-1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  -1 \\\\ 0  -0.5 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    This is an upper triangular matrix, so the eigenvalues are the diagonal entries: $\\lambda_1 = -1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -0.5$. Since both are negative, $P_3$ is a **stable node**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the flow starting near the specified initial condition**\nThe problem states that the initial condition is near the state where Tech-A is almost non-existent and Tech-B is near its carrying capacity. This corresponds to a point $(x_0, y_0)$ where $x_0 \\to 0^+$ and $y_0 \\approx 0.5$. This is a point in the immediate vicinity of the saddle point $P_2 = (0, 0.5)$.\n\nThe behavior of trajectories near a saddle point is dominated by its unstable manifold. To find the direction of the unstable manifold, we find the eigenvector corresponding to the positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 0.5$ at $P_2$.\nLet $v = \\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\end{pmatrix}$ be the eigenvector.\n$$\n(J(0,0.5) - \\lambda_1 I)v = 0 \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} 0.5 - 0.5  0 \\\\ -0.5  -0.5 - 0.5 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ -0.5  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe second row gives the equation $-0.5 v_x - v_y = 0$, or $v_y = -0.5 v_x$.\nChoosing $v_x = 2$, we get $v_y = -1$. The unstable eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThis means that trajectories starting near the saddle point $(0, 0.5)$ (with $x  0$) will move away from it in the direction of this eigenvector. The direction $(2, -1)$ indicates that $x$ increases (moves right) and $y$ decreases (moves down).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the analysis**\nThe initial state is near the saddle point $P_2 = (0, 0.5)$. The trajectory will flow away from this saddle point along its unstable manifold. The direction of this manifold indicates that $x(t)$ will increase and $y(t)$ will decrease.\n\nThe only stable equilibrium point in the system is the stable node $P_3 = (1, 0)$. In a competitive exclusion model like this one, where there is no stable coexistence point, trajectories starting in the interior of the first quadrant (where $x0, y0$) must approach one of the stable equilibria on the axes. The only stable equilibrium is $P_3$.\n\nTherefore, the trajectory starting near $(0, 0.5)$ will evolve across the phase plane, with Tech-A's market share ($x$) growing and Tech-B's ($y$) shrinking, until the system reaches the state $(1, 0)$, where Tech-A has completely dominated the market and Tech-B has been eliminated.\n\nThis corresponds to the description in option D.\n\nLet's check the other options:\nA. The origin $(0,0)$ is an unstable node, so trajectories flow away from it. This is incorrect.\nB. This describes the trajectory approaching $(0, 0.5)$, but this point is a saddle and is unstable to perturbations in the x-direction. So this is incorrect.\nC. We found there is no stable coexistence equilibrium point. This is incorrect.\nE. This is a competition model with self-limiting terms ($-x^2$, $-y^2$), so runaway growth is impossible.
