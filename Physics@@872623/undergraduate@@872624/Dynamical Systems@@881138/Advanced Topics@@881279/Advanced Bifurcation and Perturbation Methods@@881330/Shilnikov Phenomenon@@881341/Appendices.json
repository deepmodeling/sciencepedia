The stability of an equilibrium point is determined by the sign of the real part of its eigenvalues. An eigenvalue $\\lambda$ corresponds to a stable direction if its real part is negative ($\\text{Re}(\\lambda)  0$) and an unstable direction if its real part is positive ($\\text{Re}(\\lambda)  0$).\n\nLet's examine the real parts of the given eigenvalues:\n- For $\\lambda_1 = 0.75$, the real part is $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_1) = 0.75$. Since $0.75  0$, this is the unstable eigenvalue.\n- For $\\lambda_2 = -0.4 + 2.1i$, the real part is $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_2) = -0.4$. Since $-0.4  0$, this is a stable eigenvalue.\n- For $\\lambda_3 = -0.4 - 2.1i$, the real part is $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_3) = -0.4$. Since $-0.4  0$, this is also a stable eigenvalue.\n\nThe presence of one real positive eigenvalue and a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues with negative real parts confirms that the equilibrium is indeed a saddle-focus.\n\nThe problem defines the saddle index as the ratio of the magnitude of the real part of the stable eigenvalues to the value of the unstable eigenvalue.\nLet's denote the unstable eigenvalue as $\\gamma$ and the real part of the stable complex conjugate eigenvalues as $\\sigma$.\nFrom our analysis:\n- The unstable eigenvalue is $\\gamma = \\lambda_1 = 0.75$.\n- The real part of the stable eigenvalues is $\\sigma = \\text{Re}(\\lambda_2) = \\text{Re}(\\lambda_3) = -0.4$.\n\nThe magnitude of the real part of the stable eigenvalues is $|\\sigma| = |-0.4| = 0.4$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the saddle index, which we will denote as $\\delta$.\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{|\\sigma|}{\\gamma}\n$$\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{0.4}{0.75}\n$$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can write it as:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{4/10}{75/100} = \\frac{4}{10} \\times \\frac{100}{75} = \\frac{40}{75}\n$$\nDividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{40 \\div 5}{75 \\div 5} = \\frac{8}{15}\n$$\nTo get a numerical answer, we perform the division:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{8}{15} \\approx 0.533333...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are 5, 3, and 3.

Thus, $P_0$ is a saddle-focus fixed point.\n\nBy tuning the control parameter $\\mu$, the physicists observe the following phenomenon: As $\\mu$ approaches a critical value $\\mu_c$ from one side, a stable periodic orbit (a limit cycle) exists whose period grows infinitely long. At precisely $\\mu = \\mu_c$, this limit cycle vanishes and is replaced by a single trajectory known as a homoclinic orbit.
