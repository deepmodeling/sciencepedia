These correspond to critical points of $V(x)$ since $V'(x)=0$. To classify them, compute $V''(x) = -2x + 1$. Then $V''(0) = 1  0$ (a local minimum) and $V''(1) = -1  0$ (a local maximum). In the phase plane, the local maximum of $V$ at $x=1$ corresponds to a saddle point; a homoclinic orbit, if it exists, must be asymptotic to this saddle as $t \\to \\pm \\infty$.\n\nAlong a homoclinic orbit to the saddle at $x=1$, the trajectory satisfies $x(t) \\to 1$ and $\\dot{x}(t) \\to 0$ as $t \\to \\pm \\infty$.

We must evaluate the given statements based on the provided properties and the theory of such bifurcations.\n\nFirst, let's identify the nature of the bifurcation. The core event is the creation or destruction of a limit cycle from a homoclinic orbit (a trajectory connecting a saddle point to itself). This is a global bifurcation, as it involves the interaction of a fixed point with a trajectory that extends over a finite region of the phase space, rather than being confined to an infinitesimal neighborhood of the fixed point.\n\nA key piece of information is the trace of the Jacobian at the saddle point, $T = -2.5$. In the context of a planar homoclinic bifurcation, the sign of the trace (or more generally, the saddle quantity $\\sigma$, which for a saddle is the sum of its eigenvalues) determines the stability of the limit cycle that is born.\n- If $T  0$, the bifurcation creates an unstable limit cycle.\n- If $T  0$, the bifurcation creates a stable limit cycle.\nIn our case, $T = -2.5  0$, so any limit cycle created by this bifurcation must be stable.\n\nAnother crucial piece of information is how the homoclinic orbit breaks as $\\mu$ varies. We are told:\n- For $\\mu  0$, the unstable manifold of the saddle spirals outwards, away from the homoclinic loop. This means trajectories escape, and no limit cycle can be formed by trapping them.\n- For $\\mu  0$, the unstable manifold of the saddle spirals inwards, into the region previously bounded by the homoclinic loop. This inward spiraling creates a trapping region. The Poincaré-Bendixson theorem, combined with the properties of this bifurcation, ensures that a limit cycle will be formed within this region.\n\nNow we can evaluate each statement:\n\nA. For any $\\mu  0$, any trajectory starting sufficiently close to the origin (but not at the origin itself) must eventually converge back to the origin.\nThis is false. The origin is a saddle point. By definition, a saddle point has both stable and unstable directions. Only trajectories starting exactly on the stable manifold will converge to the origin. Trajectories starting on the unstable manifold move away from the origin. Trajectories starting near the origin but not on the stable manifold will be repelled from the origin, at least initially.\n\nB. A single, unique unstable limit cycle is created as $\\mu$ passes through $0$.\nThis is false. Since the trace $T = -2.5  0$, the limit cycle created must be stable, not unstable.\n\nC. The bifurcation that occurs at $\\mu=0$ is classified as a local bifurcation, as it fundamentally involves the behavior of a single fixed point.\nThis is false. A homoclinic bifurcation is a classic example of a global bifurcation. While it involves a fixed point, it is characterized by the global structure of its manifolds (the homoclinic orbit). The resulting limit cycle is not an infinitesimal object near the fixed point.\n\nD. The period of the limit cycle that is generated by this bifurcation approaches infinity as the parameter $\\mu$ approaches the critical value of $0$.\nThis is true. As $\\mu \\to 0^-$, the stable limit cycle (which exists for $\\mu  0$) grows in size and approaches the shape of the homoclinic orbit $\\Gamma$. A trajectory traversing this cycle must pass very close to the saddle point at the origin. The dynamics slow down dramatically near any fixed point, and especially near a saddle. The time spent in the vicinity of the saddle diverges as the trajectory gets closer to it. Therefore, the period of the limit cycle must diverge to infinity as $\\mu \\to 0^-$.\n\nE. A single, unique stable limit cycle is created for values of $\\mu  0$.\nThis is false. The problem states that for $\\mu  0$, the unstable manifold spirals outwards. This means trajectories are not contained, and no trapping region is formed. Therefore, no limit cycle is created for $\\mu  0$. The stable limit cycle is created for $\\mu  0$.\n\nF. At the moment of bifurcation, $\\mu=0$, the homoclinic orbit $\\Gamma$ represents a stable, periodic solution of the system.\nThis is false. First, a homoclinic orbit is not a periodic solution. A trajectory on a periodic orbit returns to its starting point in a finite time $P  0$. A trajectory on a homoclinic orbit takes an infinite amount of time to travel from the saddle back to itself (as explained for statement D). Second, regarding stability, a homoclinic orbit is generally semi-stable, attracting from one side and repelling from the other. It is not a stable object in the same way a stable limit cycle is.\n\nG. For $\\mu  0$, a stable limit cycle exists, and any trajectory starting just outside this cycle will spiral towards it as time $t \\to \\infty$.\nThis is true. As established, a stable limit cycle is created for $\\mu  0$. A defining property of a stable limit cycle is that it attracts all nearby trajectories, both from the inside and the outside. Therefore, a trajectory starting just outside the cycle will be attracted to it.\n\nIn summary, the only true statements are D and G.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{DG}$$", "id": "1682151"}]}
