It is a standard, well-posed problem in theoretical condensed matter physics. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires us to analyze the Landau free-energy density $F(m)$ to determine the static isothermal susceptibility $\\chi$.\n\nFirst, we identify the conjugate field. In thermodynamics, the differential of an energy-like potential includes terms of the form $-(\\text{generalized force}) \\times (\\text{generalized displacement})$. For the given free-energy density, $F(m)$, the term $-h\\,m$ shows that the external field $h$ is the generalized force conjugate to the order parameter $m$.\n\nSecond, we derive the general expression for the susceptibility $\\chi$. The equilibrium state of the system is found by minimizing the free-energy density $F(m)$ with respect to the order parameter $m$. This gives the equilibrium condition:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial m} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the given expression for $F(m)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial m} \\left( \\frac{a}{2} m^{2} + \\frac{b}{4} m^{4} - h\\, m \\right) = a m + b m^{3} - h = 0\n$$\nThis equation, $h = a m + b m^{3}$, is the equation of state, which relates the order parameter $m$ to the external field $h$ at a given temperature (since $a$ is temperature-dependent).\n\nThe static isothermal susceptibility is defined as $\\chi = \\frac{\\partial m}{\\partial h}$. We can find this by differentiating the equation of state with respect to $h$ while holding temperature constant (and thus holding $a$ and $b$ constant):\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial h} (h) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial h} (a m + b m^{3})\n$$\nUsing the chain rule on the right-hand side, since $m$ is a function of $h$:\n$$\n1 = a \\frac{\\partial m}{\\partial h} + b (3 m^{2}) \\frac{\\partial m}{\\partial h}\n$$\n$$\n1 = \\left( a + 3 b m^{2} \\right) \\frac{\\partial m}{\\partial h}\n$$\nSubstituting the definition $\\chi = \\frac{\\partial m}{\\partial h}$:\n$$\n1 = (a + 3 b m^{2}) \\chi\n$$\nSolving for $\\chi$ gives the general expression for the susceptibility:\n$$\n\\chi = \\frac{1}{a + 3 b m^{2}}\n$$\nFor this equilibrium to be thermodynamically stable, it must correspond to a local minimum of the free energy, which requires the second derivative of $F(m)$ to be positive:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} F}{\\partial m^{2}} = a + 3 b m^{2}  0\n$$\nWe observe that $\\chi^{-1} = \\frac{\\partial^{2} F}{\\partial m^{2}}$, so the stability condition ensures that $\\chi$ is positive, as physically required for a response that lowers the energy.\n\nThird, we evaluate $\\chi$ at zero external field, $h=0$, for the two specified phases. At $h=0$, the equation of state becomes:\n$$\na m + b m^{3} = m (a + b m^{2}) = 0\n$$\nThe possible equilibrium solutions for $m$ are $m=0$ and, if $a/b  0$, $m = \\pm \\sqrt{-a/b}$.\n\nCase 1: Disordered Phase ($a0$)\nIn this phase, since $a0$ and $b0$ is given, $a/b  0$. The equation $m^{2} = -a/b$ has no real solutions. The only real equilibrium solution is $m=0$.\nWe must check the stability of this solution. The stability condition is $a + 3 b m^{2}  0$. At $m=0$, this becomes $a  0$, which is true for the disordered phase. Thus, $m=0$ is the stable equilibrium solution.\nThe susceptibility in the disordered phase at zero field, denoted $\\chi_{disordered}$, is found by substituting $m=0$ into the general expression for $\\chi$:\n$$\n\\chi_{disordered} = \\frac{1}{a + 3 b (0)^{2}} = \\frac{1}{a}\n$$\n\nCase 2: Ordered Phase ($a0$)\nIn this phase, since $a0$ and $b0$, we have $a/b  0$. The equation of state $m(a + bm^2) = 0$ has three real solutions:\n1. $m_0 = 0$\n2. $m_{\\pm} = \\pm \\sqrt{-a/b}$\n\nWe check the stability of these solutions.\nFor $m_0=0$: The stability condition is $a + 3b(0)^2 = a  0$. However, we are in the ordered phase where $a0$. Thus, $m_0=0$ is an unstable equilibrium (a local maximum of $F$) and is not the physical state.\nFor $m_{\\pm} = \\pm \\sqrt{-a/b}$: Here, $m^{2} = -a/b$. The stability condition is:\n$$\na + 3b m^{2} = a + 3b \\left(-\\frac{a}{b}\\right) = a - 3a = -2a\n$$\nSince we are in the phase where $a0$, it follows that $-2a  0$. Thus, the solutions $m = \\pm \\sqrt{-a/b}$ correspond to two equivalent, stable equilibrium states (the spontaneously broken symmetry states).\nThe susceptibility in the ordered phase at zero field, denoted $\\chi_{ordered}$, is found by substituting $m^{2} = -a/b$ into the general expression for $\\chi$:\n$$\n\\chi_{ordered} = \\frac{1}{a + 3 b m^{2}} = \\frac{1}{a + 3b(-a/b)} = \\frac{1}{a - 3a} = \\frac{1}{-2a}\n$$\nThese results are consistent with the known behavior near a second-order phase transition within mean-field theory, where the susceptibility diverges as the critical point ($a=0$) is approached from either side.\n\nThe final answer consists of the two expressions for the zero-field susceptibility: $\\frac{1}{a}$ for the disordered phase ($a0$) and $\\frac{1}{-2a}$ for the ordered phase ($a0$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{a}  \\frac{1}{-2a} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2999154"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the basics of continuous transitions, this practice explores the case of a discontinuous, or first-order, phase transition.

Analysis of Minima and Coexistence Region**\n\nThe equilibrium values of the order parameter $m$ correspond to the minima of the free-energy density $F$. We must satisfy two conditions: stationarity and stability.\n\n**Stationarity condition**: The first derivative of $F$ with respect to $m$ must be zero.\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial m} = a m + w m^{2} + b m^{3} = m(a + w m + b m^{2}) = 0$$\nThis equation has stationary points at $m=0$ and at the roots of the quadratic equation $b m^{2} + w m + a = 0$, which are:\n$$m_{\\pm} = \\frac{-w \\pm \\sqrt{w^{2} - 4ab}}{2b}$$\nThese roots are real and distinct from zero if $w^{2} - 4ab  0$ and $a \\ne 0$.\n\n**Stability condition**: The second derivative of $F$ with respect to $m$ must be positive.\n$$\\frac{\\partial^{2} F}{\\partial m^{2}} = a + 2wm + 3bm^{2}  0$$\nLet's analyze the stability of the stationary points:\n-   For $m=0$: $\\frac{\\partial^{2} F}{\\partial m^{2}}\\Big|_{m=0} = a$. Thus, the disordered phase $m=0$ is a locally stable minimum if $a  0$, i.e., for $T  T_{0}$.\n-   For $m=m_{\\pm}$: We can use the stationarity condition $a = -wm - bm^{2}$ to simplify the second derivative:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial^{2} F}{\\partial m^{2}}\\Big|_{m_{\\pm}} = (-wm_{\\pm} - bm_{\\pm}^{2}) + 2wm_{\\pm} + 3bm_{\\pm}^{2} = wm_{\\pm} + 2bm_{\\pm}^{2} = m_{\\pm}(w+2bm_{\\pm})$$\n    Substituting the expression for $m_{\\pm}$, we get $w+2bm_{\\pm} = w + 2b\\left(\\frac{-w \\pm \\sqrt{w^{2}-4ab}}{2b}\\right) = \\pm\\sqrt{w^{2}-4ab}$.\n    So, $\\frac{\\partial^{2} F}{\\partial m^{2}}\\Big|_{m_{\\pm}} = m_{\\pm}(\\pm\\sqrt{w^{2}-4ab})$.\n\nThe problem asks for the region with two distinct locally stable minima. This occurs when the minimum at $m=0$ coexists with another minimum at $m \\neq 0$.\n-   The minimum at $m=0$ is stable for $a0$.\n-   A second minimum appears when the expression $w^2-4ab$ becomes positive. This happens when $a  \\frac{w^2}{4b}$.\nTherefore, the coexistence of two minima requires $0  a  \\frac{w^2}{4b}$. In this range, $m=0$ is a stable minimum. For the other minimum, one of the $m_\\pm$ must be stable. Without loss of generality, assume $w0$. Then $m_+ = \\frac{-w + \\sqrt{w^2-4ab}}{2b}$ is positive, and $\\frac{\\partial^{2} F}{\\partial m^{2}}\\Big|_{m_{+}} = m_{+}(\\sqrt{w^{2}-4ab})  0$, so it is a stable minimum. The other root $m_-$ corresponds to a maximum. If $w0$, the stable minimum is at $m_-  0$.\nThe region of coexistence is thus defined by $0  a  \\frac{w^2}{4b}$, which corresponds to the temperature range $T_0  T  T_0 + \\frac{w^2}{4\\alpha b}$. The two locally stable minima are located at $m=0$ and at $m_{neq} = \\frac{-w - \\text{sgn}(w)\\sqrt{w^2-4ab}}{2b}$.\n\n**2. First-Order Transition Temperature and Order Parameter**\n\nA first-order phase transition occurs at a temperature $T_t$ where the free energies of the two competing stable phases are equal. One phase is the disordered phase with $m=0$, and the other is an ordered phase with $m=m_t \\neq 0$.\n\nThe conditions at the transition point $(T_t, m_t)$ are:\n1.  $m_t$ is a non-zero minimum: $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial m}\\Big|_{m_t} = 0$.\n2.  The free energies are equal: $F(m_t, T_t) = F(0, T_t)$.\n\nFrom $F(0, T_t) = 0$, the second condition becomes:\n$$\\frac{a_t}{2}m_{t}^{2}+\\frac{w}{3}m_{t}^{3}+\\frac{b}{4}m_{t}^{4} = 0$$\nwhere $a_t = a(T_t)$. Since $m_t \\neq 0$, we can divide by $m_t^2/12$:\n$$6a_t + 4wm_t + 3bm_t^2 = 0 \\quad (\\text{Eq. 1})$$\nThe first condition (stationarity) for $m_t \\neq 0$ gives:\n$$a_t + wm_t + bm_t^2 = 0 \\quad (\\text{Eq. 2})$$\nWe now solve this system of two equations for $m_t$ and $a_t$. Multiply Eq. 2 by $6$ and subtract Eq. 1:\n$$(6a_t + 6wm_t + 6bm_t^2) - (6a_t + 4wm_t + 3bm_t^2) = 0$$\n$$2wm_t + 3bm_t^2 = 0$$\n$$m_t(2w + 3bm_t) = 0$$\nSince $m_t \\neq 0$, we find the value of the order parameter at the transition:\n$$m_t = -\\frac{2w}{3b}$$\nNow, substitute $m_t$ back into Eq. 2 to find $a_t$:\n$$a_t = -wm_t - bm_t^2 = -w\\left(-\\frac{2w}{3b}\\right) - b\\left(-\\frac{2w}{3b}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{2w^{2}}{3b} - b\\left(\\frac{4w^{2}}{9b^{2}}\\right)$$\n$$a_t = \\frac{2w^{2}}{3b} - \\frac{4w^{2}}{9b} = \\frac{6w^{2} - 4w^{2}}{9b} = \\frac{2w^{2}}{9b}$$\nThe transition temperature $T_t$ is found from the relation $a_t = \\alpha(T_t - T_0)$:\n$$\\frac{2w^{2}}{9b} = \\alpha(T_t - T_0) \\implies T_t = T_0 + \\frac{2w^{2}}{9\\alpha b}$$\n\n**3.

The entropy density $s$ is defined by the thermodynamic relation $s = -\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial T}$.

Letting $y = m^2$, we have a quadratic equation for $y$:\n$$\nuy^2 + by + at = 0\n$$\nThe solutions for $m^2$ are:\n$$\nm^2_{\\pm} = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4aut}}{2u}\n$$\nFor $m$ to be real, $m^2$ must be real and non-negative. This requires the discriminant to be non-negative, $b^2 - 4aut \\ge 0$, and the resulting value for $m^2$ to be positive.\n\nThe stability of these points is determined by the sign of the second derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial m^2} = at + 3bm^2 + 5um^4\n$$\nFor a minimum, $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial m^2}  0$. For a maximum, $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial m^2}  0$.\n\n- **Stability of $m_0=0$**:\nAt $m=0$, we have $\\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial m^2}\\right|_{m=0} = at$.\n  - If $t  0$ ($T  T_c$), $at  0$, so $m=0$ is a stable minimum (the symmetric phase).\n  - If $t  0$ ($T  T_c$), $at  0$, so $m=0$ is a maximum (unstable).\n  - If $t=0$, the second derivative is zero, and higher-order terms must be checked.\n\n- **Stability of $m \\ne 0$**:\nFor a non-zero stationary point, $at = -bm^2 - um^4$. Substituting this into the second derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial m^2} = (-bm^2 - um^4) + 3bm^2 + 5um^4 = 2bm^2 + 4um^4 = 2m^2(b + 2um^2)\n$$\nSince $m^2  0$, stability requires $b+2um^2  0$.\nLet's check this condition for $m^2_{\\pm}$:\n$$\nb + 2um^2_{\\pm} = b + 2u \\left( \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4aut}}{2u} \\right) = b - b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4aut} = \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4aut}\n$$\nSo, for the solution $m^2_+ = \\frac{-b + \\sqrt{b^2 - 4aut}}{2u}$, the second derivative is proportional to $+\\sqrt{b^2 - 4aut}$. If real non-zero solutions exist, this corresponds to minima.\nFor the solution $m^2_- = \\frac{-b - \\sqrt{b^2 - 4aut}}{2u}$, the second derivative is proportional to $-\\sqrt{b^2 - 4aut}$, corresponding to maxima.\nTherefore, the only stable non-zero solutions are $m = \\pm \\sqrt{m^2_+}$.\n\n**2. First-Order Transition for $b0$**\n\nA first-order transition occurs when the global minimum of the free energy jumps discontinuously from one value of $m$ to another. This happens if the minimum at $m=0$ and the minima at $m \\ne 0$ are simultaneously stable and have the same free energy density. The transition occurs when $f(m_{tr}; T_{tr}) = f(m=0; T_{tr})$, where $m_{tr} \\ne 0$ is a stable minimum.\nThe two conditions for the first-order transition point are:\n1. $f(m_{tr}) - f_0(T) = \\frac{a}{2}t_{tr}m_{tr}^2 + \\frac{b}{4}m_{tr}^4 + \\frac{u}{6}m_{tr}^6 = 0$\n2. $\\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial m}\\right|_{m_{tr}} = at_{tr}m_{tr} + bm_{tr}^3 + um_{tr}^5 = 0$\n\nSince $m_{tr} \\ne 0$, we can divide both equations by powers of $m_{tr}$:\n1. $\\frac{a}{2}t_{tr} + \\frac{b}{4}m_{tr}^2 + \\frac{u}{6}m_{tr}^4 = 0$\n2. $at_{tr} + bm_{tr}^2 + um_{tr}^4 = 0$\n\nFrom (2), $at_{tr} = -bm_{tr}^2 - um_{tr}^4$.\nSubstitute this into (1):\n$\\frac{1}{2}(-bm_{tr}^2 - um_{tr}^4) + \\frac{b}{4}m_{tr}^2 + \\frac{u}{6}m_{tr}^4 = 0$\n$(-\\frac{b}{2}+\\frac{b}{4})m_{tr}^2 + (-\\frac{u}{2}+\\frac{u}{6})m_{tr}^4 = 0$\n$-\\frac{b}{4}m_{tr}^2 - \\frac{u}{3}m_{tr}^4 = 0$\nDividing by $-m_{tr}^2$ (since $m_{tr} \\ne 0$):\n$\\frac{b}{4} + \\frac{u}{3}m_{tr}^2 = 0 \\implies m_{tr}^2 = -\\frac{3b}{4u}$.\nFor $m_{tr}$ to be real, we must have $b0$ (since $u0$), which confirms that this type of transition only occurs for negative $b$. The magnitude of the magnetization jump at coexistence is $|m_{tr}| = \\sqrt{-\\frac{3b}{4u}}$.\n\nNow, we find the transition temperature $t_{tr}$ by substituting $m_{tr}^2$ back into the extremum condition (2):\n$at_{tr} + b\\left(-\\frac{3b}{4u}\\right) + u\\left(-\\frac{3b}{4u}\\right)^2 = 0$\n$at_{tr} - \\frac{3b^2}{4u} + u\\frac{9b^2}{16u^2} = 0$\n$at_{tr} - \\frac{3b^2}{4u} + \\frac{9b^2}{16u} = 0$\n$at_{tr} = \\frac{3b^2}{4u} - \\frac{9b^2}{16u} = \\left(\\frac{12-9}{16}\\right)\\frac{b^2}{u} = \\frac{3b^2}{16u}$\n$$\nt_{tr} = T_{tr} - T_c = \\frac{3b^2}{16au}\n$$\nThis equation defines the coexistence line in the $(T,b)$ plane. Since $t_{tr}0$ for $b \\ne 0$, the transition is indeed first-order discontinuous, occurring at a temperature $T_{tr}  T_c$.\n\n**3. Tricritical Point and Scaling**\n\nA tricritical point (TCP) separates a line of first-order transitions from a line of second-order transitions.\n- For $b  0$, the transition is second-order and occurs at $t=0$. The order parameter grows continuously from $m=0$ for $t0$.\n- For $b  0$, the transition is first-order and occurs at $t_{tr} = \\frac{3b^2}{16au}  0$. The order parameter jumps from $0$ to $|m_{tr}| = \\sqrt{-\\frac{3b}{4u}}$.\n\nAs $b \\to 0^-$, both the temperature shift $t_{tr}$ and the magnetization jump $|m_{tr}|$ approach zero. The point where the two lines meet is $(t,b)=(0,0)$. This is the tricritical point.\n\nTo analyze the behavior at the TCP, we set $b=0$ in the free energy expansion:\n$$\nf(m;T) - f_0(T) = \\frac{a}{2}tm^2 + \\frac{u}{6}m^6\n$$\nWe are interested in the ordered phase, which exists for $t0$. The condition for the minimum of the free energy is $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial m}=0$:\n$$\natm + um^5 = m(at + um^4) = 0\n$$\nThe solutions are $m=0$ and $um^4 = -at$. For $t0$, we can write $t=-|t|$, so $um^4 = a|t|$.\nThe spontaneous magnetization solutions are:\n$$\nm_s = \\pm \\left( \\frac{a|t|}{u} \\right)^{1/4} = \\pm \\left( \\frac{a(T_c-T)}{u} \\right)^{1/4}\n$$\nThe second derivative is $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial m^2} = at + 5um^4$.\nAt $m=m_s$, this gives $at + 5u(-at/u) = at - 5at = -4at = 4a|t|  0$. Thus, these solutions are stable minima.\nThe scaling of the spontaneous magnetization with reduced temperature is $m_s \\sim |t|^{\\beta}$ with the critical exponent $\\beta = 1/4$.\n\nNext, we find the singular part of the equilibrium free energy by substituting $m_s$ back into the free energy expression:\n$f_{sing}(T) = f(m_s,T) - f_0(T) = \\frac{a}{2}tm_s^2 + \\frac{u}{6}m_s^6$\nUsing the relation $um_s^4 = -at$:\n$m_s^6 = m_s^2 \\cdot m_s^4 = m_s^2 \\left(-\\frac{at}{u}\\right)$.\n$f_{sing}(T) = \\frac{a}{2}tm_s^2 + \\frac{u}{6}m_s^2\\left(-\\frac{at}{u}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{at}{2} - \\frac{at}{6}\\right)m_s^2 = \\frac{at}{3}m_s^2$.\nWe have $m_s^2 = \\sqrt{-at/u}$.\n$f_{sing}(T) = \\frac{at}{3}\\sqrt{\\frac{-at}{u}} = -\\frac{a^{3/2}}{3\\sqrt{u}}(-t)^{3/2}$ for $t0$. For $t0$, $m_s=0$ so $f_{sing}=0$.\n\nFinally, the specific heat singularity exponent $\\alpha$ is found from the second derivative of the free energy with respect to temperature. The singular part of the specific heat $c_{sing} \\propto -\\frac{\\partial^2 f_{sing}}{\\partial T^2} = -\\frac{\\partial^2 f_{sing}}{\\partial t^2}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_{sing}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left[ -\\frac{a^{3/2}}{3\\sqrt{u}}(-t)^{3/2} \\right] = -\\frac{a^{3/2}}{3\\sqrt{u}} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2}(-t)^{1/2} \\cdot (-1) = \\frac{a^{3/2}}{2\\sqrt{u}}(-t)^{1/2}\n$$\n$$\nc_{sing} \\propto -\\frac{\\partial^2 f_{sing}}{\\partial t^2} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left[ \\frac{a^{3/2}}{2\\sqrt{u}}(-t)^{1/2} \\right] = -\\frac{a^{3/2}}{2\\sqrt{u}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}(-t)^{-1/2} \\cdot(-1) = \\frac{a^{3/2}}{4\\sqrt{u}}(-t)^{-1/2}\n$$\nThe specific heat diverges as $c_{sing} \\sim |t|^{-1/2}$. Comparing with the definition $c_{sing} \\sim |t|^{-\\alpha}$, we find the tricritical exponent $\\alpha=1/2$.\n\nThe specific question for the final answer is the expression for the spontaneous magnetization $m(T)$ at tricriticality ($b=0$) for $TT_c$ as a function of $a$, $u$, and $T-T_c$. Taking the positive root by convention:\n$$\nm(T) = \\left( \\frac{a(T_c-T)}{u} \\right)^{1/4} = \\left( \\frac{-a(T-T_c)}{u} \\right)^{1/4}\n$$\nThis expression is valid for $TT_c$, ensuring the argument of the root is positive.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left( \\frac{-a(T-T_c)}{u} \\right)^{1/4}}$$", "id": "2999188"}]}
