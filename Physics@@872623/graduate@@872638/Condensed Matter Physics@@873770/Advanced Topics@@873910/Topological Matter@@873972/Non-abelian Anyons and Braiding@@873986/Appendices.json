By the associativity of fusion, we can think of this process as first fusing the initial $k-1$ anyons and then fusing their combined topological charge with the $k$-th anyon.\n\nThe state of the first $k-1$ anyons is a superposition of the possible total charge outcomes. The number of ways to obtain the vacuum charge $1$ is $a_{k-1}$, and the number of ways to obtain the charge $\\tau$ is $b_{k-1}$. We can represent this abstractly as the formal sum $a_{k-1} \\cdot 1 + b_{k-1} \\cdot \\tau$.\n\nTo find the outcomes for $k$ anyons, we fuse this result with the $k$-th anyon, which has charge $\\tau$:\n$$ (a_{k-1} \\cdot 1 + b_{k-1} \\cdot \\tau) \\times \\tau $$\nUsing the distributivity of fusion and the given fusion rules:\n$$ a_{k-1} \\cdot (1 \\times \\tau) + b_{k-1} \\cdot (\\tau \\times \\tau) $$\nSubstituting the fusion rules $1 \\times \\tau = \\tau$ and $\\tau \\times \\tau = 1 + \\tau$:\n$$ a_{k-1} \\cdot \\tau + b_{k-1} \\cdot (1 + \\tau) $$\n$$ a_{k-1} \\cdot \\tau + b_{k-1} \\cdot 1 + b_{k-1} \\cdot \\tau $$\nCollecting terms by their resulting charge:\n$$ b_{k-1} \\cdot 1 + (a_{k-1} + b_{k-1}) \\cdot \\tau $$\nFrom this expression, we can read off the dimensions for the fusion of $k$ anyons. The coefficient of the vacuum charge $1$ gives $a_k$, and the coefficient of the charge $\\tau$ gives $b_k$. This yields the following system of recurrence relations:\n$$ a_k = b_{k-1} $$\n$$ b_k = a_{k-1} + b_{k-1} $$\n\nWe are interested in finding an expression for $a_n$. From the first relation, we have $a_k = b_{k-1}$, which implies $a_{k+1} = b_k$. Substituting this into the second relation gives:\n$$ a_{k+1} = a_{k-1} + a_k $$\nThis is the well-known recurrence relation for the Fibonacci numbers.

The matrix representation is $(B_1 B_2)^3$. We first analyze the matrix $M = B_1 B_2$. The eigenvalues of this matrix will simplify the computation of its cube.\nLet $R_1 = \\exp(-i\\frac{\\pi}{8})$ and $R_\\psi = \\exp(i\\frac{3\\pi}{8})$. An important relation in the Ising model is $R_\\psi = iR_1$, because $\\exp(i\\frac{3\\pi}{8}) = \\exp(i(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\frac{\\pi}{8})) = \\exp(i\\frac{\\pi}{2})\\exp(-i\\frac{\\pi}{8}) = iR_1$.\nUsing this, the matrices become:\n$$B_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} R_1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & iR_1 \\end{pmatrix} = R_1 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & i \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$B_2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} R_1+iR_1 & R_1-iR_1 \\\\ R_1-iR_1 & R_1+iR_1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{R_1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1+i & 1-i \\\\ 1-i & 1+i \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe product is:\n$$M = B_1 B_2 = R_1 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & i \\end{pmatrix} \\frac{R_1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1+i & 1-i \\\\ 1-i & 1+i \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{R_1^2}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1+i & 1-i \\\\ i(1-i) & i(1+i) \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{R_1^2}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1+i & 1-i \\\\ 1+i & -1+i \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe determinant and trace of $M$ are:\n$$\\det(M) = \\det(B_1)\\det(B_2) = (R_1 \\cdot iR_1) \\cdot (R_1 \\cdot iR_1) = (iR_1^2)^2 = -R_1^4$$\n$$\\text{Tr}(M) = \\frac{R_1^2}{2}((1+i) + (-1+i)) = \\frac{R_1^2}{2}(2i) = iR_1^2$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $M$ satisfy the characteristic equation $\\lambda^2 - \\text{Tr}(M)\\lambda + \\det(M) = 0$:\n$$\\lambda^2 - (iR_1^2)\\lambda - R_1^4 = 0$$\nThe solutions are:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{iR_1^2 \\pm \\sqrt{(iR_1^2)^2 - 4(1)(-R_1^4)}}{2} = \\frac{iR_1^2 \\pm \\sqrt{-R_1^4 + 4R_1^4}}{2} = \\frac{iR_1^2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}R_1^2}{2} = R_1^2 \\left( \\frac{i \\pm \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right)$$\nThe two distinct eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = R_1^2 \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}+i}{2} \\right) = R_1^2 \\exp(i\\frac{\\pi}{6})$ and $\\lambda_2 = R_1^2 \\left( \\frac{-\\sqrt{3}+i}{2} \\right) = R_1^2 \\exp(i\\frac{5\\pi}{6})$.\nSince the eigenvalues are distinct, the matrix $M=B_1 B_2$ is diagonalizable.\nThe matrix for the full twist is $M^3 = (B_1 B_2)^3$. Its eigenvalues are the cubes of the eigenvalues of $M$:\n$$\\lambda_1^3 = \\left( R_1^2 \\exp(i\\frac{\\pi}{6}) \\right)^3 = R_1^6 \\exp(i\\frac{3\\pi}{6}) = R_1^6 \\exp(i\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = iR_1^6$$\n$$\\lambda_2^3 = \\left( R_1^2 \\exp(i\\frac{5\\pi}{6}) \\right)^3 = R_1^6 \\exp(i\\frac{15\\pi}{6}) = R_1^6 \\exp(i\\frac{5\\pi}{2}) = R_1^6 \\exp(i(2\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2})) = iR_1^6$$\nBoth eigenvalues of $(B_1 B_2)^3$ are identical. Since $B_1 B_2$ is diagonalizable, it can be written as $M=PDP^{-1}$ where $D$ is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. Then $M^3 = PD^3P^{-1}$. The matrix $D^3$ is diagonal with identical entries $\\lambda_1^3 = \\lambda_2^3 = iR_1^6$ on the diagonal, so $D^3 = (iR_1^6)I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\nTherefore, $M^3 = P((iR_1^6)I)P^{-1} = (iR_1^6)PIP^{-1} = (iR_1^6)I$.\nThis verifies that the operator $(\\sigma_1\\sigma_2)^3$ is proportional to the identity. The scalar of proportionality is the common eigenvalue $iR_1^6$.\n\nFinally, we compute the value of this scalar:\n$$iR_1^6 = i \\left( \\exp(-i\\frac{\\pi}{8}) \\right)^6 = i \\exp(-i\\frac{6\\pi}{8}) = i \\exp(-i\\frac{3\\pi}{4})$$\n$$= \\exp(i\\frac{\\pi}{2}) \\exp(-i\\frac{3\\pi}{4}) = \\exp(i(\\frac{2\\pi}{4}-\\frac{3\\pi}{4})) = \\exp(-i\\frac{\\pi}{4})$$\nThis complex scalar is $\\cos(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}) + i\\sin(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - i\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. The action of the full twist $\\Delta^2$ on the fusion space is multiplication by this scalar.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\exp\\left(-i\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)}$$", "id": "3007402"}]}
