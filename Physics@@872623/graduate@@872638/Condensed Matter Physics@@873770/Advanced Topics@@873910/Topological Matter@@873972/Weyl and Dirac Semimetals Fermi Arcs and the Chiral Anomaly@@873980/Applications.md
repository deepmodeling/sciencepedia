## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the fundamental principles governing Weyl and Dirac [semimetals](@entry_id:152277), including the origin of Weyl nodes as [topological defects](@entry_id:138787) in momentum space, the consequent emergence of Fermi arc surface states, and the manifestation of the [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077) as a quantum mechanical violation of classical conservation laws. Having built this theoretical foundation, we now turn to the application of these principles in diverse, real-world, and interdisciplinary contexts. The objective of this chapter is not to reiterate core concepts but to demonstrate their utility, extension, and integration in applied fields. We will explore how the abstract topology of the [electronic bands](@entry_id:175335) gives rise to concrete, measurable signatures and novel physical phenomena, bridging the gap between theoretical constructs and experimental reality.

### Experimental Signatures of Topological States

The confirmation of the exotic [electronic states](@entry_id:171776) in Weyl [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) stands as a triumph of modern experimental condensed matter physics. Verifying the existence of entities like Fermi arcs and quantifying the effects of the [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077) requires a suite of sophisticated techniques, each providing a unique piece of the evidentiary puzzle.

#### Probing the Surface: Fermi Arcs

The most direct prediction of bulk Weyl topology is the existence of topologically protected Fermi arcs on the surface. These are not closed loops, as in conventional metals, but open contours that connect the projections of bulk Weyl nodes of opposite [chirality](@entry_id:144105). Their definitive identification rests on two pillars: confirming their surface-localized nature and verifying their topological connectivity to the bulk nodes.

Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) has been the primary tool for visualizing Fermi arcs. By measuring the kinetic energy and emission angle of photoejected electrons, ARPES maps the electronic band structure $E(\mathbf{k})$. A rigorous ARPES protocol to confirm a Fermi arc involves several critical steps. First, the feature in question must be demonstrated to be a surface state. This is achieved by varying the incident [photon energy](@entry_id:139314), which systematically changes the momentum component perpendicular to the surface, $k_z$. A true surface state's dispersion $E(k_x, k_y)$ will not change with [photon energy](@entry_id:139314), whereas bulk bands will show clear dispersion with $k_z$. Second, the topological connectivity must be confirmed. This involves mapping the constant-energy contour and showing that it is an open arc whose endpoints terminate precisely at the surface projections of the bulk Weyl nodes. These bulk node positions can be independently determined through photon-energy-dependent ARPES measurements that map the full 3D bulk [band structure](@entry_id:139379). A more advanced verification, directly testing the [bulk-boundary correspondence](@entry_id:137647), involves tracing a closed loop in the surface Brillouin zone that encloses a single Weyl node projection and counting the net number of chiral surface modes that cross it. A non-zero net chirality, measured by the sign of the states' group velocity, provides a direct measure of the enclosed [topological charge](@entry_id:142322). [@problem_id:3024267]

Complementary evidence for the open nature of Fermi arcs comes from real-space imaging with a Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM). By measuring the [local density of states](@entry_id:136852), and specifically its Fourier transform, one can map the [quasiparticle interference](@entry_id:146303) (QPI) patterns that arise from electrons scattering off defects. For a conventional metal with a closed Fermi surface, backscattering between states at momenta $\mathbf{k}$ and $-\mathbf{k}$ is a dominant process, leading to strong QPI signals at wavevector $\mathbf{q} \approx 2\mathbf{k}$. In a Weyl semimetal with a single open Fermi arc, this process is profoundly suppressed for two reasons. Kinetically, for a generic state on the arc, there is no corresponding state at $-\mathbf{k}$ to scatter into. Dynamically, the [surface states](@entry_id:137922) possess a chiral [spin-momentum locking](@entry_id:139865). Backscattering would require a spin-flip for a nonmagnetic impurity, a process that is strongly suppressed due to the orthogonality of the initial and final spin states. Therefore, the systematic absence of [backscattering](@entry_id:142561) features in the QPI pattern serves as a powerful, albeit indirect, signature of both the open topology of the Fermi arc and the chiral character of its constituent states. [@problem_id:3024299]

#### Probing the Bulk: The Chiral Anomaly and Anomalous Transport

While Fermi arcs are a surface phenomenon, the [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077) is a bulk effect with dramatic consequences for electronic transport. The pumping of charge between Weyl nodes in parallel electric and magnetic fields gives rise to a set of unique magnetotransport signatures.

The most celebrated of these is a positive longitudinal magnetoconductivity, or equivalently, a [negative longitudinal magnetoresistance](@entry_id:146729) (NLMR), where the material's resistance decreases when a magnetic field is applied parallel to the current. The [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077) predicts a conductivity enhancement $\Delta \sigma \propto B^2$. However, experimentally verifying that an observed NLMR is of topological origin is a formidable challenge, as classical effects can mimic this behavior. A prominent artifact is "current jetting," where the magnetic field makes the [conductivity tensor](@entry_id:155827) anisotropic, causing the current to focus into narrow streams. If voltage probes happen to lie within such a stream, they will measure an artificially low resistance. A stringent experimental protocol to isolate the intrinsic anomaly requires a multi-pronged approach. It combines optimized sample geometry (e.g., long, narrow Hall bars with wide contacts to promote uniform current) with systematic measurements of the [resistivity](@entry_id:266481) as a function of the angle $\theta$ between the electric field $\mathbf{E}$ and magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$, verifying the expected $\cos^2\theta$ dependence of the conductivity enhancement. The definitive control experiment involves fabricating the material into a Corbino [disk geometry](@entry_id:748538). In this setup, a [radial electric field](@entry_id:194700) is everywhere perpendicular to an applied axial magnetic field, ensuring $\mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$. The [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077) contribution must vanish in this geometry. Observing NLMR in the Hall bar but not in the Corbino disk, combined with quantitative finite-element modeling that bounds the contribution from classical artifacts, provides compelling evidence for the anomaly's role. [@problem_id:3024249]

A related transport phenomenon is the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). In a time-reversal-broken Weyl semimetal, the Weyl nodes are separated in momentum space. This separation, $\sum_\alpha \chi_\alpha \mathbf{b}_\alpha$, where $\chi_\alpha$ is the charge of node $\alpha$ at position $\mathbf{b}_\alpha$, acts as an effective magnetic field in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936). This intrinsic Berry curvature gives rise to an anomalous Hall conductivity even in the absence of an external magnetic field. The resulting anomalous Hall [pseudovector](@entry_id:196296) $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$, which relates the Hall current to the electric field via $\mathbf{j} = \boldsymbol{\sigma} \times \mathbf{E}$, is directly proportional to this momentum-space dipole moment of the Weyl nodes:
$$ \boldsymbol{\sigma} = \frac{e^2}{2\pi h} \sum_\alpha \chi_\alpha \mathbf{b}_\alpha $$
This provides a direct link between a measurable transport coefficient and the topological charge and positions of the Weyl nodes in the Brillouin zone. [@problem_id:3024298]

### Novel Physical Phenomena and Material Engineering

The unique interplay of bulk and surface states in Weyl semimetals gives rise to entirely new physical phenomena and offers avenues for engineering topological properties by controlling material parameters and geometry.

#### The Weyl Orbit: A Mixed-Space Phenomenon

A remarkable consequence of the coexistence of surface Fermi arcs and bulk chiral modes is the "Weyl orbit." Consider a slab of a Weyl semimetal in a magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ applied perpendicular to its surfaces. The bulk [electronic states](@entry_id:171776) quantize into Landau levels, and crucially, each Weyl node contributes a one-dimensional chiral zeroth Landau level whose group velocity is locked to its [chirality](@entry_id:144105), propagating parallel to $\mathbf{B}$ for one chirality and antiparallel for the other. These chiral Landau levels act as perfect electronic waveguides through the bulk. The [group velocity](@entry_id:147686) of the Fermi arc states on the two opposite surfaces of the slab must be opposite, a consequence of the opposite orientation of the surface normal vectors in the context of the [bulk-boundary correspondence](@entry_id:137647). This sets the stage for a closed orbit in a hybrid of real and momentum space: an electron traverses the Fermi arc on the top surface, enters a bulk chiral Landau level that transports it to the bottom surface, traverses the Fermi arc in the opposite direction on the bottom surface, and finally returns to the top surface via the other bulk chiral Landau level. [@problem_id:3024300]

This Weyl orbit is not merely a theoretical curiosity; it has concrete experimental consequences. It can be detected via nonlocal transport measurements. By injecting current on one surface of the slab and measuring a voltage on the opposite surface, one can probe this unique conduction path. The phenomenon has several key signatures. The nonlocal signal must be odd in the perpendicular magnetic field $B_z$, reflecting the chiral nature of the transport. Furthermore, the closed Weyl orbit is subject to [semiclassical quantization](@entry_id:180422), leading to [quantum oscillations](@entry_id:142355) periodic in $1/B$. The frequency of these oscillations is proportional to the phase-space area of the orbit, which includes the slab thickness $L$. Thus, a "smoking gun" signature of the Weyl orbit is a nonlocal voltage that exhibits [quantum oscillations](@entry_id:142355) whose frequency increases linearly with the sample thickness $L$. The signal's amplitude is also sensitive to the [intervalley scattering](@entry_id:136281) length $\ell_v$, decaying as $\exp(-L/\ell_v)$ when the slab becomes too thick for coherent transport between the nodes. [@problem_id:3024273]

#### Engineering and Modifying Topological States

The manifestation of topological features is not an immutable property of a material but can be profoundly influenced by its geometry, doping level, and intrinsic [band structure](@entry_id:139379) details.

The very existence and shape of Fermi arcs depend on the orientation of the crystal surface. The arc connects the projections of the bulk Weyl nodes onto the surface Brillouin zone. The separation of these projected points depends on the angle $\theta$ between the surface normal $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ and the vector $\mathbf{b}$ connecting the nodes in the bulk, scaling as $|\mathbf{b}|\sin\theta$. Consequently, if a surface is chosen such that its normal is parallel to the node separation vector ($\theta=0$), the nodes project to the same point. In this case, the [topological protection](@entry_id:145388) for an open arc is lost, and the surface states can gap out or form trivial closed pockets. The arc is most prominent and has the largest span for surfaces perpendicular to the node separation vector ($\theta=\pi/2$). [@problem_id:3024270]

Moving beyond the idealized case of a perfectly undoped semimetal, a finite chemical potential $\mu$ (finite [doping](@entry_id:137890)) also modifies the Fermi surface. The Weyl nodes in the bulk are no longer [singular points](@entry_id:266699) at the Fermi energy but are instead surrounded by small electron or [hole pockets](@entry_id:269009). The Fermi arc, which must terminate where the [surface states](@entry_id:137922) merge with bulk states, now serves as a bridge connecting these two finite-sized bulk Fermi pockets. To a first approximation, this can be viewed as a rigid shift of the zero-energy arc. Furthermore, the degree of localization of the surface state is not uniform. Its penetration depth into the bulk is inversely proportional to the local bulk energy gap. This gap is largest midway between the node projections and vanishes at the projections themselves. Consequently, the surface state is most tightly bound to the surface near the center of the arc and becomes delocalized, diverging into the bulk as it approaches the endpoints where it merges with the gapless bulk states. [@problem_id:3024281]

The richness of Weyl physics extends to materials with more complex topological charges. In "multi-Weyl [semimetals](@entry_id:152277)," band crossings can be protected by point-group symmetries to have a topological charge $|\chi|$ greater than one. The bulk-boundary correspondence principle holds in a quantifiable way: the number of co-propagating chiral [surface states](@entry_id:137922) is given by the magnitude of the Chern number of 2D slices of the Brillouin zone. For a pair of double-Weyl nodes with charge $\pm 2$, the Chern number of slices between the nodes is $\pm 2$. This directly implies the existence of two distinct Fermi arcs connecting the projections of the bulk nodes. The number of Fermi arcs is a direct visual indicator of the magnitude of the bulk [topological charge](@entry_id:142322). [@problem_id:3024287]

Finally, Weyl [semimetals](@entry_id:152277) themselves are classified into type-I, where the Weyl cone is upright, and type-II, where it is so strongly tilted that electron and [hole pockets](@entry_id:269009) coexist even at the nodal energy. This tilt has profound consequences for the [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077). For a type-II node, well-defined Landau levels—a prerequisite for the standard picture of anomaly-driven [spectral flow](@entry_id:146831)—only form if the magnetic field is oriented within a critical cone around the tilt direction. Outside this cone, the semiclassical electron orbits in a magnetic field are open hyperbolas, Landau quantization collapses, and the chiral charge pumping mechanism is quenched. Within the allowed cone, however, the [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077) survives with its universal, topologically protected coefficient. This demonstrates that even fundamental topological responses can be contingent on material-specific parameters like band tilting. [@problem_id:3024269]

### Connections to Broader Theoretical Frameworks

The physics of Weyl semimetals provides a fertile ground where concepts from condensed matter, [high-energy physics](@entry_id:181260), and [hydrodynamics](@entry_id:158871) intersect.

#### Hydrodynamics and Collective Modes

In a clean Weyl semimetal where [electron-electron interactions](@entry_id:139900) are strong, the long-wavelength dynamics of charge and energy can be described by the universal laws of [hydrodynamics](@entry_id:158871). This framework treats the vector [charge density](@entry_id:144672) $n$ and the axial [charge density](@entry_id:144672) $n_5$ as coupled hydrodynamic fields. Crucially, while [electron-electron interactions](@entry_id:139900) renormalize thermodynamic quantities like the charge susceptibilities ($\chi = \partial n / \partial \mu$) and transport coefficients like diffusion constants, the [axial anomaly](@entry_id:148365) coefficient $C$ in the continuity equation $\partial_t n_5 + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{j}_5 = C \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{B} - n_5/\tau_5$ remains unrenormalized due to its topological origin. Furthermore, long-range Coulomb interactions play a critical role; by coupling the vector charge density $n$ to a self-consistent electric field, they promote the purely diffusive charge mode into a high-energy gapped [plasmon](@entry_id:138021). This qualitative change in the vector charge dynamics in turn strongly modifies the dispersion and damping of all coupled modes of the system, such as the chiral magnetic wave. [@problem_id:3024268]

#### Quantum Field Theory and the Nature of Anomalies

The [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077) in a Weyl semimetal is a direct descendant of the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly in high-energy quantum [field theory](@entry_id:155241) (QFT). The formal QFT framework provides a deeper understanding of its structure, especially when multiple gauge fields are present. When both a vector (electromagnetic) field $V_\mu$ and an axial field $A_\mu$ (representing the node separation) are considered, a distinction arises between "consistent" and "covariant" anomalies. Consistent anomalies are the divergences of currents derived from a single [effective action](@entry_id:145780), and they must satisfy certain algebraic constraints (the Wess-Zumino [consistency conditions](@entry_id:637057)). Covariant anomalies, on the other hand, are given by simple, gauge-invariant expressions but cannot be derived from a single action. It is possible to move the anomaly between the vector and axial sectors by adding a local polynomial of the gauge fields, known as a Bardeen counterterm, to the action. For instance, in the presence of a mixed anomaly, one can add a term like $S_B = \frac{1}{6\pi^2}\int d^4x\,\varepsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} A_\mu V_\nu \partial_\rho V_\sigma$ to cancel the anomaly in the vector current and shift its effects entirely into the axial current's divergence. This procedure is essential for maintaining the conservation of the physical electromagnetic current, grounding the condensed matter phenomenon in the rigorous structure of QFT. [@problem_id:3024284]

In conclusion, the principles of Weyl [semimetals](@entry_id:152277), while abstract in their formulation, lead to a remarkably rich and concrete phenomenology. From directly observable signatures in spectroscopy and transport to the engineering of novel quantum states and deep connections with hydrodynamics and quantum [field theory](@entry_id:155241), the study of these materials continues to push the frontiers of our understanding of the quantum world.
