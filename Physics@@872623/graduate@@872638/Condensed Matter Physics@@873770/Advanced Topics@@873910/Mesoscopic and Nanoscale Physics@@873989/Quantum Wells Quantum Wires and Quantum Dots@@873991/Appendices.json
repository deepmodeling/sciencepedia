Current conservation (unitarity): $S^{\\dagger}S = I$, where $I$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix.\n2.  Time-reversal symmetry: $S$ can be chosen to be real and symmetric, so $S^T = S$ and $S^* = S$. This implies $S^{\\dagger} = S^T = S$. The unitarity condition then simplifies to $S^2 = I$.\n3.

The current injected from lead $1$ must be distributed among the other leads. With the applied voltages, current flows out through leads $2$ and $3$, which are both grounded. The permutation symmetry of the junction, explicitly stated as $S_{12}=S_{13}=t$, means the transmission probabilities $T_{21} = |S_{21}|^2$ and $T_{31} = |S_{31}|^2$ are identical. Since leads $2$ and $3$ are indistinguishable from the perspective of lead $1$ and are at the same potential, the outgoing current must split equally between them. Therefore, half of the injected current exits through lead $2$ and the other half through lead $3$. This gives $F = 1/2$ without needing the explicit values of $r$ and $t$, as long as a non-trivial junction ($t \\neq 0$) exists.

The Schrödinger equation for the $x$-direction is:\n$$ \\left( -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^*} \\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m^*\\omega_{0}^{2}x^{2} \\right) \\psi_x(x) = E_x \\psi_x(x) $$\nThe energy eigenvalues for the 1D QHO are $E_{n_x} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_0$, where $n_x = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$. The normalized ground-state wavefunction ($n_x=0$) is:\n$$ \\psi_{0,x}(x) = \\left(\\frac{m^*\\omega_{0}}{\\pi\\hbar}\\right)^{1/4} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m^*\\omega_{0}}{2\\hbar}x^2\\right) $$\nDue to the isotropy of the potential, the problem in the $y$-direction is identical.\n\nTo find the ground-state wavefunction of the 2D system, we take the ground state for each direction, i.e., $n_x=0$ and $n_y=0$. The total ground-state wavefunction $\\psi_0(x,y)$ is the product of the 1D ground-state wavefunctions:\n$$ \\psi_{0}(x,y) = \\psi_{0,x}(x) \\psi_{0,y}(y) $$\n$$ \\psi_{0}(x,y) = \\left(\\frac{m^*\\omega_{0}}{\\pi\\hbar}\\right)^{1/4} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m^*\\omega_{0}}{2\\hbar}x^2\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{m^*\\omega_{0}}{\\pi\\hbar}\\right)^{1/4} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m^*\\omega_{0}}{2\\hbar}y^2\\right) $$\n$$ \\psi_{0}(x,y) = \\left(\\frac{m^*\\omega_{0}}{\\pi\\hbar}\\right)^{1/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m^*\\omega_{0}}{2\\hbar}(x^2+y^2)\\right) $$\nThis is the normalized ground-state wavefunction.\n\nThe characteristic confinement length, $l_0$, is a natural length scale of the harmonic oscillator problem. It appears in the argument of the exponential of the wavefunction, which is typically written in the form $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2+y^2}{2l_0^2}\\right)$. By comparing this form with our derived wavefunction's exponential term, $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{m^*\\omega_{0}}{2\\hbar}(x^2+y^2)\\right)$, we can identify $l_0$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{l_0^2} = \\frac{m^*\\omega_{0}}{\\hbar} \\implies l_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{m^*\\omega_{0}}} $$\n\nNext, we determine the energy levels to apply the room-temperature condition. The total energy is $E_{n_x, n_y} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_0 + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_0 = (n_x + n_y + 1)\\hbar\\omega_0$.\nThe ground state has quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y) = (0,0)$, with energy $E_0 = (0+0+1)\\hbar\\omega_0 = \\hbar\\omega_0$.\nThe first excited state corresponds to the next lowest energy. This occurs when $n_x+n_y=1$, which gives two degenerate states: $(n_x, n_y)=(1,0)$ and $(n_x, n_y)=(0,1)$. The energy of this level is $E_1 = (1+0+1)\\hbar\\omega_0 = 2\\hbar\\omega_0$.\nThe energy spacing between the ground state and the first excited state is $\\Delta E = E_1 - E_0 = 2\\hbar\\omega_0 - \\hbar\\omega_0 = \\hbar\\omega_0$.\n\nThe condition for \"room-temperature operation\" is that the Boltzmann factor for occupying the first excited orbital state relative to the ground state is smaller than $0.01$ at $T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The Boltzmann factor is $\\exp(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T})$.\nThe condition is:\n$$ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T}\\right)  0.01 $$\nSubstituting $\\Delta E=\\hbar\\omega_0$:\n$$ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_0}{k_B T}\\right)  0.01 $$\nTo find the minimum level spacing that satisfies this, we solve the inequality for $\\hbar\\omega_0$:\n$$ -\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_0}{k_B T}  \\ln(0.01) $$\n$$ -\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_0}{k_B T}  \\ln(10^{-2}) = -2\\ln(10) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\hbar\\omega_0}{k_B T}  2\\ln(10) $$\nThe minimum required energy spacing is therefore:\n$$ (\\hbar\\omega_0)_{\\mathrm{min}} = 2 k_B T \\ln(10) $$\nWe are given $T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The value of the Boltzmann constant $k_B$ is approximately $8.617333 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{eV/K}$. We first calculate the thermal energy $k_B T$ in units of milli-electron-volts ($\\mathrm{meV}$):\n$$ k_B T = (8.617333 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{eV/K}) \\times (300 \\, \\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.025852 \\, \\mathrm{eV} = 25.852 \\, \\mathrm{meV} $$\nNow we can compute the minimum energy spacing:\n$$ (\\hbar\\omega_0)_{\\mathrm{min}} = 2 \\times (25.852 \\, \\mathrm{meV}) \\times \\ln(10) $$\nUsing $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585$:\n$$ (\\hbar\\omega_0)_{\\mathrm{min}} \\approx 2 \\times 25.852 \\, \\mathrm{meV} \\times 2.302585 $$\n$$ (\\hbar\\omega_0)_{\\mathrm{min}} \\approx 119.0553 \\, \\mathrm{meV} $$\nThe problem requires the result rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ (\\hbar\\omega_0)_{\\mathrm{min}} \\approx 119.1 \\, \\mathrm{meV} $$\nThis is the minimum value for the level spacing $\\hbar\\omega_0$ (which is equal to $\\Delta E$ in this system) to ensure that thermal excitations to the first excited state are suppressed according to the given criterion at room temperature.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{119.1} $$", "id": "3012772"}]}
