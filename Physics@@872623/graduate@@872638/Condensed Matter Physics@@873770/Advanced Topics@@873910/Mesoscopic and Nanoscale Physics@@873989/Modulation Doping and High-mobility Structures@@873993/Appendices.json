At zero temperature, scattering is elastic and occurs for electrons at the Fermi energy. The transport scattering time is given by an integral over all possible final states, weighted by a factor that emphasizes back-scattering:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_{tr}} = \\sum_{\\mathbf{k'}} W(\\mathbf{k} \\to \\mathbf{k'}) (1 - \\cos\\theta)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{k}$ and $\\mathbf{k'}$ are the initial and final wavevectors on the Fermi circle ($|\\mathbf{k}|=|\\mathbf{k'}|=k_F$), $\\theta$ is the scattering angle between them, and $W(\\mathbf{k} \\to \\mathbf{k'})$ is the scattering rate from state $\\mathbf{k}$ to $\\mathbf{k'}$.\n\nUsing Fermi's golden rule, the scattering rate is:\n$$\nW(\\mathbf{k} \\to \\mathbf{k'}) = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar} \\left\\langle |\\langle \\mathbf{k'}|V|\\mathbf{k}\\rangle|^2 \\right\\rangle \\delta(E_k - E_{k'})\n$$\nThe angle brackets $\\langle \\dots \\rangle$ denote an ensemble average over the random interface roughness profile. The perturbation potential is given as $V(\\mathbf{r}) \\approx (\\partial E_1 / \\partial L) \\delta L(\\mathbf{r})$. The electron wavefunctions are products of a 2D plane wave and the ground state wavefunction of the infinite well: $\\psi_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{r},z) = A^{-1/2} e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}\\phi_1(z)$, where $A$ is the area. The matrix element is:\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbf{k'}|V|\\mathbf{k}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{A} \\int V(\\mathbf{r}) e^{-i(\\mathbf{k'}-\\mathbf{k})\\cdot\\mathbf{r}} d^2\\mathbf{r} = \\frac{1}{A} \\left(\\frac{\\partial E_1}{\\partial L}\\right) \\delta L_{\\mathbf{q}}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{q} = \\mathbf{k'} - \\mathbf{k}$ is the scattering vector and $\\delta L_{\\mathbf{q}}$ is the 2D Fourier transform of the roughness profile $\\delta L(\\mathbf{r})$.\nThe ensemble average of the squared matrix element is related to the power spectrum of the roughness, $S(q) = A^{-1}\\langle|\\delta L_{\\mathbf{q}}|^2\\rangle$:\n$$\n\\left\\langle |\\langle \\mathbf{k'}|V|\\mathbf{k}\\rangle|^2 \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{A^2} \\left(\\frac{\\partial E_1}{\\partial L}\\right)^2 \\langle|\\delta L_{\\mathbf{q}}|^2\\rangle = \\frac{1}{A} \\left(\\frac{\\partial E_1}{\\partial L}\\right)^2 S(q)\n$$\nThe power spectrum $S(q)$ is the 2D Fourier transform of the given Gaussian autocorrelation function $C(r) = \\Delta^2 \\exp(-r^2/\\Lambda^2)$:\n$$\nS(q) = \\int C(\\mathbf{r}) e^{-i\\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}} d^2\\mathbf{r} = \\pi \\Delta^2 \\Lambda^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{q^2\\Lambda^2}{4}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $q = |\\mathbf{q}|$.\n\nNext, we convert the sum over final states $\\mathbf{k'}$ to an integral: $\\sum_{\\mathbf{k'}} \\to \\frac{A}{(2\\pi)^2}\\int d^2k'$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_{tr}} = \\frac{A}{(2\\pi)^2} \\int \\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar} \\frac{S(q)}{A} \\left(\\frac{\\partial E_1}{\\partial L}\\right)^2 (1-\\cos\\theta) \\delta(E_k - E_{k'}) d^2k'\n$$\nWe integrate over $k'=|\\mathbf{k'}|$ and the scattering angle $\\theta$. The delta function $\\delta(E_k - E_{k'})$ enforces that scattering is elastic on the Fermi circle where $E_k = E_{k'} = E_F$. The integral over the magnitude $k'$ yields the 2D density of states at the Fermi level, $D(E_F)=\\frac{m^*}{\\pi\\hbar^2}$ (per unit area, per spin), giving a factor of $\\frac{A m^*}{\\pi\\hbar^2}$. Summing over two spin states, the integral evaluates to $\\frac{A m^*}{\\pi\\hbar^2}$.\nA more direct evaluation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_{tr}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\hbar} \\left(\\frac{\\partial E_1}{\\partial L}\\right)^2 \\int S(q) (1-\\cos\\theta) \\delta(E_F - E_{k'}) d^2k'\n$$\nUsing $d^2k' = k'dk'd\\theta$ and $E_{k'} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k'^2}{2m^*}$, the integral over $k'$ is $\\int_0^\\infty k'dk' \\delta(\\frac{\\hbar^2 k_F^2}{2m^*} - \\frac{\\hbar^2 k'^2}{2m^*} ) = \\frac{m^* k_F}{\\hbar^2}\\frac{1}{k_F} \\int \\delta(k_F-k') k'dk' = \\frac{m^*}{\\hbar^2}$.

It is a constant with respect to the well width $L$.\nSubstituting this back, the transport lifetime is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_{tr}} = \\frac{m^*\\Delta^2\\Lambda^2}{2\\hbar^3} \\left(\\frac{\\partial E_1}{\\partial L}\\right)^2 I_{ang}(k_F\\Lambda)\n$$\nThe mobility is $\\mu_{\\mathrm{IR}} = e\\tau_{tr}/m^*$:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{IR}}(L) = \\frac{2e\\hbar^3}{m^{*2}\\Delta^2\\Lambda^2 I_{ang}(k_F\\Lambda)} \\left(\\frac{\\partial E_1}{\\partial L}\\right)^{-2}\n$$\nThe energy of the lowest subband in an infinite square well of width $L$ is $E_1(L) = \\frac{\\pi^2\\hbar^2}{2m^*L^2}$.\nThe derivative with respect to L is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E_1}{\\partial L} = \\frac{\\pi^2\\hbar^2}{2m^*} \\left(-2L^{-3}\\right) = -\\frac{\\pi^2\\hbar^2}{m^*L^3}\n$$\nSquaring this gives:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial E_1}{\\partial L}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi^4\\hbar^4}{m^{*2}L^6}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the mobility expression:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{IR}}(L) = \\frac{2e\\hbar^3}{m^{*2}\\Delta^2\\Lambda^2 I_{ang}(k_F\\Lambda)} \\left(\\frac{\\pi^4\\hbar^4}{m^{*2}L^6}\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{2e\\hbar^3 m^{*2}L^6}{m^{*2}\\Delta^2\\Lambda^2 I_{ang}(k_F\\Lambda)\\pi^4\\hbar^4}\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{IR}}(L) = \\left(\\frac{2e}{\\pi^4\\hbar\\Delta^2\\Lambda^2 I_{ang}(k_F\\Lambda)}\\right) L^6\n$$\nThe key result is that the mobility is proportional to the sixth power of the well width: $\\mu_{\\mathrm{IR}}(L) \\propto L^6$.\n\n**Part 2: Single-Subband Occupancy Constraint**\n\nThe problem requires that only the lowest subband is populated. This means the Fermi energy, $E_F$, must be less than the energy of the bottom of the second subband, $E_2(L)$.\nThe energy of an electron is $E_{n,k} = E_n(L) + \\frac{\\hbar^2k^2}{2m^*}$.\nThe energy levels in an infinite well are $E_n(L) = \\frac{n^2\\pi^2\\hbar^2}{2m^*L^2}$.\nThe Fermi energy is the energy of the highest occupied state, which is in the first subband ($n=1$):\n$$\nE_F = E_1(L) + \\frac{\\hbar^2k_F^2}{2m^*}\n$$\nwhere $k_F$ is the Fermi wavevector. The constraint is $E_F  E_2(L)$:\n$$\nE_1(L) + \\frac{\\hbar^2k_F^2}{2m^*}  E_2(L)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $E_1$ and $E_2$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi^2\\hbar^2}{2m^*L^2} + \\frac{\\hbar^2k_F^2}{2m^*}  \\frac{4\\pi^2\\hbar^2}{2m^*L^2}\n$$\nWe can cancel the common factor of $\\hbar^2/(2m^*)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2} + k_F^2  \\frac{4\\pi^2}{L^2}\n$$\nRearranging the inequality to solve for $L$:\n$$\nk_F^2  \\frac{4\\pi^2}{L^2} - \\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2} = \\frac{3\\pi^2}{L^2}\n$$\n$$\nL^2 k_F^2  3\\pi^2 \\implies L^2  \\frac{3\\pi^2}{k_F^2} \\implies L  \\frac{\\sqrt{3}\\pi}{k_F}\n$$\nThe 2D sheet density $n_s$ is related to the Fermi wavevector $k_F$ by $n_s = k_F^2/(2\\pi)$. Thus, $k_F = \\sqrt{2\\pi n_s}$.\nSubstituting for $k_F$:\n$$\nL  \\frac{\\sqrt{3}\\pi}{\\sqrt{2\\pi n_s}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3\\pi^2}{2\\pi n_s}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3\\pi}{2n_s}}\n$$\nThis inequality defines an upper limit on the well width, $L_{max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3\\pi}{2n_s}}$, to ensure single-subband occupancy.\n\n**Part 3: Optimization of Mobility**\n\nWe need to find the well width $L$ that maximizes the mobility $\\mu_{\\mathrm{IR}}(L)$ subject to the constraint $L  L_{max}$.\nFrom Part 1, we found that $\\mu_{\\mathrm{IR}}(L) \\propto L^6$. All the prefactors are positive constants. Therefore, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{IR}}(L)$ is a strictly monotonically increasing function of $L$ for $L  0$.\nTo maximize a monotonically increasing function over a given interval, one must choose the largest possible value in that interval. The allowed interval for $L$ is $(0, L_{max})$.\nThe maximum mobility is thus achieved as $L$ approaches its upper bound, $L_{max}$. The optimal width is therefore:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{opt}} = L_{max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3\\pi}{2n_s}}\n$$\nThis expression gives the optimal well width solely in terms of the sheet density $n_s$ and the constant $\\pi$, as requested by the problem statement. The physical interpretation is that wider wells have smoother confinement potential fluctuations for a given interface roughness, leading to weaker scattering and higher mobility. The single-subband constraint prevents the well from becoming arbitrarily wide, thus defining a unique optimum width at the boundary of this constraint.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{3\\pi}{2n_{s}}}}\n$$", "id": "3005903"}, {"introduction": "Even in a perfectly grown heterostructure, mobility is limited by the fundamental interaction between electrons and lattice vibrations, or phonons.
