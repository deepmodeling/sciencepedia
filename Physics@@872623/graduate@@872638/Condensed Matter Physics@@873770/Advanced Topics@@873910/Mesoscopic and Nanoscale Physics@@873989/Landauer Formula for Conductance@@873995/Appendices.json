A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem is addressed in two parts as requested: first, a dimensional analysis of the terms in the Landauer formula, and second, a numerical calculation of the conductance prefactor.\n\n**Part 1: Dimensional Analysis**\n\nThe total conductance is given by the expression $G = \\frac{2 e^{2}}{h} \\sum_{n} T_{n}$. For this equation to be dimensionally consistent, the right-hand side must have the units of conductance. We will analyze the dimensions of the summation term and the prefactor separately.\n\nFirst, consider the term $\\sum_{n} T_{n}$. The quantity $T_n$ is defined as the transmission probability for the $n$-th mode. A probability is a ratio of like quantities (e.g., transmitted flux over incident flux) and is therefore a pure, dimensionless number. A summation of dimensionless numbers, $\\sum_{n} T_{n}$, results in a dimensionless quantity. Therefore, the term $\\sum_{n} T_{n}$ is dimensionless.\n\nNext, we analyze the dimensions of the prefactor, $\\frac{2 e^{2}}{h}$. The factor of $2$ arises from spin degeneracy and is a dimensionless pure number. We denote the dimensions of a physical quantity $X$ by $[X]$. The elementary charge $e$ has the dimension of charge, $[e] = Q$, which is the Coulomb ($C$) in SI units. Planck's constant $h$ has dimensions of energy multiplied by time, $[h] = E \\cdot T$. In SI units, this is Joule-second ($J \\cdot s$). The dimensions of the prefactor are therefore:\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{e^2}{h}\\right] = \\frac{[e]^2}{[h]} = \\frac{Q^2}{E \\cdot T}\n$$\nIn SI units, this is $\\frac{C^2}{J \\cdot s}$.\n\nNow, we must verify that these are the dimensions of conductance. Conductance $G$ is defined as the ratio of current $I$ to voltage $V$: $G = I/V$. The dimension of current, which is the rate of flow of charge, is $[I] = Q/T$. In SI units, this is Ampere ($A$), where $1\\,\\mathrm{A} = 1\\,\\mathrm{C/s}$. The dimension of voltage (electric potential difference), which is energy per unit charge, is $[V] = E/Q$. In SI units, this is Volt ($V$), where $1\\,\\mathrm{V} = 1\\,\\mathrm{J/C}$.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of conductance are:\n$$\n[G] = \\frac{[I]}{[V]} = \\frac{Q/T}{E/Q} = \\frac{Q^2}{E \\cdot T}\n$$\nIn SI units, this corresponds to $\\frac{C/s}{J/C} = \\frac{C^2}{J \\cdot s}$. This unit is defined as the Siemens ($S$).\n\nComparing the dimensions of the prefactor $\\frac{e^2}{h}$ with the dimensions of conductance $G$, we find they are identical.\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{e^2}{h}\\right] = \\frac{Q^2}{E \\cdot T} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad [G] = \\frac{Q^2}{E \\cdot T}\n$$\nThis confirms that the prefactor $\\frac{2e^2}{h}$ has units of conductance. Since the summation term is dimensionless, the entire expression for $G$ correctly has the units of conductance, validating the dimensional consistency of the Landauer formula.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are asked to compute the numerical value of the prefactor, which is known as the quantum of conductance, $G_0 = \\frac{2 e^2}{h}$.\nThe given values for the constants are:\n- Elementary charge, $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,C$.\n- Planck's constant, $h = 6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\,J \\cdot s$.\n\nWe substitute these values into the expression for $G_0$:\n$$\nG_0 = \\frac{2 e^2}{h} = \\frac{2 \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,C)^2}{6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\,J \\cdot s}\n$$\nLet's calculate the numerical value:\n$$\nG_0 = \\frac{2 \\times (1.602176634)^2 \\times 10^{-38}}{6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}} \\frac{C^2}{J \\cdot s}\n$$\n$$\nG_0 = \\frac{2 \\times 2.566970054...}{6.62607015} \\times 10^{-4} \\, S\n$$\n$$\nG_0 = \\frac{5.133940108...}{6.62607015} \\times 10^{-4} \\, S\n$$\n$$\nG_0 \\approx 0.7748091729... \\times 10^{-4} \\, S\n$$\n$$\nG_0 \\approx 7.748091729... \\times 10^{-5} \\, S\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be in microsiemens ($\\mu S$).

The first five significant figures are $7, 7, 4, 8, 0$.

The problem provides all necessary information and contains no contradictions. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to compute the linear-response conductance $G=I/V$ for a perfect one-dimensional channel using two formalisms and show their equivalence.\n\n### 1. Scattering-State Counting Approach (Landauer-Büttiker Formalism)\n\nThis approach views electrical current as a flux of charge carriers in scattering states. The net current is the difference between the charge flux originating from the left reservoir and moving to the right, and the charge flux from the right reservoir moving to the left.\n\nThe current carried by electrons in a single channel within an infinitesimal energy interval $dE$ is given by the product of the charge $-e$, the number of available states per unit energy, the group velocity of the carriers, and the probability that the states are occupied.\n\nThe problem provides a crucial property of a one-dimensional channel: the product of the group velocity $v(E)$ and the one-dimensional density of states per unit length, per spin, and per propagation direction, $D_{1D, \\sigma, \\rightarrow}(E)$, is a universal constant.\n$$\nv(E) \\cdot D_{1D, \\sigma, \\rightarrow}(E) = \\frac{1}{h}\n$$\nThe quantity $v(E) \\cdot D_{1D, \\sigma, \\rightarrow}(E) \\cdot dE$ represents the number of states per second, per spin, and per direction, within the energy range $dE$. Therefore, the number of states supplied by a reservoir per unit time in the energy interval $dE$ is $\\frac{1}{h}dE$ for each spin channel and each direction.\n\nThe channel is spin-degenerate, meaning there are two independent channels (spin-up and spin-down). It is also reflectionless, so the transmission probability $\\mathcal{T}(E)$ for any electron entering the channel is unity, $\\mathcal{T}(E)=1$.\n\nThe charge current from left to right, $I_{\\rightarrow}$, is carried by electrons from the left reservoir, which has occupation function $f_L(E) = f(E-\\mu_L)$. The current from right to left, $I_{\\leftarrow}$, is from the right reservoir with occupation $f_R(E) = f(E-\\mu_R)$. The net current $I$ flowing from left to right is the sum of contributions from both reservoirs (taking direction into account).\n\nThe contribution from the left reservoir is:\n$$\nI_{L \\rightarrow R} = \\sum_{\\text{spins}} \\int dE \\cdot e \\cdot (\\text{rate of states}) \\cdot \\mathcal{T}(E) \\cdot f_L(E)\n$$\nHere, the sum over spins gives a factor of $2$. The rate of states is $1/h$.\n$$\nI_{L \\rightarrow R} = 2 \\int dE \\frac{e}{h} \\cdot 1 \\cdot f_L(E) = \\frac{2e}{h} \\int f_L(E) dE\n$$\nSimilarly, the contribution from the right reservoir gives a current flowing from right to left:\n$$\nI_{R \\rightarrow L} = \\frac{2e}{h} \\int f_R(E) dE\n$$\nThe net current $I$ from left to right is the difference:\n$$\nI = I_{L \\rightarrow R} - I_{R \\rightarrow L} = \\frac{2e}{h} \\int \\left[ f_L(E) - f_R(E) \\right] dE\n$$\nThis is the celebrated Landauer formula for a two-terminal device.\n\nNow, we apply the specific conditions. The temperature is $T=0$, so the Fermi-Dirac distributions are step functions: $f(E-\\mu) = \\Theta(\\mu-E)$, where $\\Theta(x)$ is the Heaviside step function. The chemical potentials are $\\mu_{L}=\\mu+\\tfrac{eV}{2}$ and $\\mu_{R}=\\mu-\\tfrac{eV}{2}$.\nThe difference in Fermi functions is:\n$$\nf_L(E) - f_R(E) = \\Theta\\left(\\mu+\\tfrac{eV}{2} - E\\right) - \\Theta\\left(\\mu-\\tfrac{eV}{2} - E\\right)\n$$\nThis difference is $1$ for $E$ in the energy window $[\\mu - \\tfrac{eV}{2}, \\mu + \\tfrac{eV}{2}]$ and $0$ otherwise. We assume $V0$.\nThe integral for the current becomes:\n$$\nI = \\frac{2e}{h} \\int_{\\mu - eV/2}^{\\mu + eV/2} (1) dE\n$$\n$$\nI = \\frac{2e}{h} \\left[ \\left(\\mu + \\frac{eV}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\mu - \\frac{eV}{2}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{2e}{h} (eV) = \\frac{2e^2}{h} V\n$$\nThe linear-response conductance $G$ is the ratio of current to voltage:\n$$\nG = \\frac{I}{V} = \\frac{2e^2}{h}\n$$\n\n### 2. Nonequilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) Approach\n\nThis formalism provides a more rigorous, microscopic framework. The current is calculated from the quantum statistical average of the current operator. For a non-interacting system in steady state, the current flowing from lead $\\alpha$ into the central device region can be expressed via the Meir-Wingreen formula. For a two-terminal setup (leads $L$ and $R$), the net current $I=I_L=-I_R$ is given by:\n$$\nI = \\frac{e}{\\hbar} \\int \\frac{dE}{2\\pi} \\left[f_L(E) - f_R(E)\\right] \\text{Tr}\\left[ \\mathbf{\\Gamma}_{L}(E) \\mathbf{G}^{r}(E) \\mathbf{\\Gamma}_{R}(E) \\mathbf{G}^{a}(E) \\right]\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{G}^{r,a}$ are the retarded and advanced Green's function matrices for the device (the 1D channel), and $\\mathbf{\\Gamma}_{\\alpha}(E) = i[\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_{\\alpha}^r(E) - \\mathbf{\\Sigma}_{\\alpha}^a(E)]$ are the lead linewidth function matrices, which describe the coupling strength to the leads. The trace is over the internal degrees of freedom of the channel (in this case, spin). The expression inside the trace is defined as the total transmission probability matrix $\\mathbf{\\mathcal{T}}(E)$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{\\mathcal{T}}(E) = \\mathbf{\\Gamma}_{L}(E) \\mathbf{G}^{r}(E) \\mathbf{\\Gamma}_{R}(E) \\mathbf{G}^{a}(E)\n$$\nThe full expression for the current, using $h=2\\pi\\hbar$, is:\n$$\nI = \\frac{e}{h} \\int dE \\left[f_L(E) - f_R(E)\\right] \\text{Tr}[\\mathbf{\\mathcal{T}}(E)]\n$$\nThe problem states the channel is spin-degenerate and supports exactly one propagating mode for each spin. The channel is also \"reflectionless\" and \"translationally invariant.\" In the NEGF language, this implies that the leads are perfectly matched to the channel. For a perfect 1D quantum wire, this means that an electron entering the channel from a lead propagates without any reflection.\nConsequently, for a given spin, the transmission probability is unity. Since the two spin channels are independent, the transmission matrix $\\mathbf{\\mathcal{T}}(E)$ is a $2 \\times 2$ diagonal matrix:\n$$\n\\mathbf{\\mathcal{T}}(E) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nfor energies where the modes exist. The trace is therefore $\\text{Tr}[\\mathbf{\\mathcal{T}}(E)] = 1+1=2$.\n\nSubstituting this into the current formula:\n$$\nI = \\frac{e}{h} \\int dE \\left[f_L(E) - f_R(E)\\right] \\cdot 2 = \\frac{2e}{h} \\int \\left[f_L(E) - f_R(E)\\right] dE\n$$\nThis is precisely the same integral expression obtained from the scattering-state approach. Evaluating it under the same $T=0$ and small $V$ conditions yields the identical result:\n$$\nI = \\frac{2e^2}{h} V\n$$\nAnd the conductance is:\n$$\nG = \\frac{I}{V} = \\frac{2e^2}{h}\n$$\n\n### 3. Equivalence of the Formalisms\n\nThe two derivations produce the same expression for the current and hence the same conductance. The equivalence is established by identifying the correspondence between the key physical quantities in each model.\n\n1.  In the **scattering-state approach**, the current is proportional to the number of available conducting channels (here, $2$ for spin degeneracy) multiplied by a phenomenological transmission probability $\\mathcal{T}(E)$, which was taken to be $1$ for a perfect channel. The fundamental rate of states per channel, $\\frac{1}{h}$, is derived from the properties of 1D systems, namely $v(E) D_{1D}(E)_{\\text{per spin, dir}} = 1/h$.\n\n2.  In the **NEGF approach**, the current is proportional to the trace of the transmission matrix, $\\text{Tr}[\\mathbf{\\mathcal{T}}(E)] = \\text{Tr}[\\mathbf{\\Gamma}_{L} \\mathbf{G}^{r} \\mathbf{\\Gamma}_{R} \\mathbf{G}^{a}]$. This expression is the rigorous, microscopic definition of the total transmission probability across all channels.\n\nThe equivalence lies in the fact that for the idealized system under consideration, the microscopic NEGF calculation of the total transmission, $\\text{Tr}[\\mathbf{\\mathcal{T}}(E)]$, evaluates to exactly the number of channels assumed in the simpler Landauer picture. The physical premise of a \"reflectionless, single-mode channel per spin\" in the problem statement allows us to deduce that $\\text{Tr}[\\mathbf{\\mathcal{T}}(E)]=2$. This value, inserted into the general Meir-Wingreen formula, reduces it to the specific Landauer formula used in the first part.\n\nThus, the NEGF formalism provides a microscopic justification for the phenomenological parameters (number of channels, transmission probability) used in the Landauer-Büttiker formalism. The step that establishes the equivalence is the recognition that $\\text{Tr}[\\mathbf{\\Gamma}_{L} \\mathbf{G}^{r} \\mathbf{\\Gamma}_{R} \\mathbf{G}^{a}]$ is the formal equivalent of the sum of transmission probabilities over all channels, $\\sum_{n} \\mathcal{T}_n(E)$. For this perfect system, both equal $2$.\n\nIn conclusion, both methods correctly predict that the conductance of a single, perfect, spin-degenerate one-dimensional channel is quantized in units of $e^2/h$.

Second, we evaluate the Fano factor by replacing the discrete sums over eigenvalues with integrals weighted by the given Dorokhov distribution density.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Current, Noise, and Fano Factor**\n\nWe consider a two-terminal conductor connected to electron reservoirs at chemical potentials $\\mu_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{R}}$. A small voltage $V0$ is applied, such that $\\mu_{\\mathrm{L}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{R}} = eV$, where $e$ is the elementary charge.

Here $\\Theta(x)$ is the Heaviside step function.\n\nThe problem specifies that the index $n$ for the transmission eigenvalues $T_n$ accounts for propagating modes including spin degeneracy. However, the standard definition of the conductance quantum $G_0 = 2e^2/h$ and the relationship between the dimensionless conductance $g = G/G_0$ and the transmission eigenvalues through the Dorokhov distribution implies that we should sum over orbital modes and include a factor of $2$ for spin degeneracy. Let $n$ be the index for the orbital (or spatial) modes.\n\nThe net electrical current $I_n$ flowing through a single orbital mode $n$ is given by the Landauer formula:\n$$I_n = \\frac{2e}{h} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} [f_{\\mathrm{L}}(E) - f_{\\mathrm{R}}(E)] T_n(E) dE$$\nThe factor of $2$ accounts for the two spin channels, which are assumed to have the same transmission probability $T_n$. The term $[f_{\\mathrm{L}}(E) - f_{\\mathrm{R}}(E)]$ is non-zero only in the energy window $[\\mu_{\\mathrm{R}}, \\mu_{\\mathrm{L}}]$, where it equals $1$. The width of this window is $eV$. Since $T_n$ is assumed to be energy-independent over this range, we can write:\n$$I_n = \\frac{2e}{h} T_n \\int_{\\mu_{\\mathrm{R}}}^{\\mu_{\\mathrm{L}}} dE = \\frac{2e}{h} T_n (eV) = \\frac{2e^2V}{h} T_n$$\nThe total current $I$ is the sum over all orbital modes:\n$$I = \\sum_n I_n = \\frac{2e^2V}{h} \\sum_n T_n$$\nThis is the first required expression.\n\nNext, we derive the zero-frequency current noise power $S$. The noise arises from the probabilistic nature of electron transmission. Each electron incident on the scatterer has a probability $T_n$ of being transmitted and $1-T_n$ of being reflected. This partitioning of the electron stream is a random process that leads to fluctuations in the current, known as shot noise. At zero temperature, thermal noise (Johnson-Nyquist noise) is absent.\n\nThe general formula for shot noise power in a single orbital mode $n$ at zero temperature is:\n$$S_n = \\frac{2 \\cdot 2e^2}{h} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} T_n(E)(1-T_n(E)) [f_{\\mathrm{L}}(E) - f_{\\mathrm{R}}(E)]^2 dE$$\nAgain, the factor of $2$ in front of $e^2/h$ is for spin. With constant $T_n$ and $[f_{\\mathrm{L}}(E) - f_{\\mathrm{R}}(E)]^2 = 1$ in the transport window of width $eV$, the integral becomes:\n$$S_n = \\frac{4e^2}{h} T_n(1-T_n) \\int_{\\mu_{\\mathrm{R}}}^{\\mu_{\\mathrm{L}}} dE = \\frac{4e^2}{h} T_n(1-T_n) (eV) = \\frac{4e^3V}{h} T_n(1-T_n)$$\nThe total noise power $S$ is the sum of contributions from all independent modes:\n$$S = \\sum_n S_n = \\frac{4e^3V}{h} \\sum_n T_n(1-T_n)$$\nThis is the second required expression.\n\nThe Fano factor $F$ is defined as the ratio of the actual shot noise power to the Poissonian shot noise value $2eI$:\n$$F \\equiv \\frac{S}{2eI}$$\nSubstituting our expressions for $I$ and $S$:\n$$F = \\frac{\\frac{4e^3V}{h} \\sum_n T_n(1-T_n)}{2e \\left( \\frac{2e^2V}{h} \\sum_m T_m \\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{4e^3V}{h} \\sum_n T_n(1-T_n)}{\\frac{4e^3V}{h} \\sum_m T_m}$$\nThe prefactors cancel, yielding the Fano factor purely in terms of the transmission eigenvalues:\n$$F = \\frac{\\sum_n T_n(1-T_n)}{\\sum_n T_n}$$\nThis can also be written as $F = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_n T_n^2}{\\sum_n T_n}$.\n\n**Part 2: Evaluation for the Dorokhov Distribution**\n\nWe are given that for a large number of modes, the discrete set of transmission eigenvalues $\\{T_n\\}$ can be described by a continuous density $\\rho(T)$:\n$$\\rho(T) = \\frac{g}{2}\\,\\frac{1}{T\\,\\sqrt{1-T}}$$\nfor $0  T  1$. The parameter $g$ is the dimensionless conductance $G/G_0$. The procedure is to replace the sums over $n$ with integrals over $T$, weighted by this density:\n$$\\sum_n f(T_n) \\longrightarrow \\int_0^1 f(T) \\rho(T) dT$$\nApplying this to the expression for the Fano factor:\n$$F = \\frac{\\int_0^1 T(1-T) \\rho(T) dT}{\\int_0^1 T \\rho(T) dT}$$\nThe problem states that the distribution is normalized such that the denominator is equal to $g$:\n$$\\int_0^1 T \\rho(T) dT = g$$\nLet's verify this given normalization:\n$$\\int_0^1 T \\left( \\frac{g}{2}\\,\\frac{1}{T\\,\\sqrt{1-T}} \\right) dT = \\frac{g}{2} \\int_0^1 (1-T)^{-1/2} dT = \\frac{g}{2} \\left[ -2\\sqrt{1-T} \\right]_0^1 = \\frac{g}{2} (0 - (-2)) = g$$\nThe normalization is correct.\n\nNow, we evaluate the numerator of the Fano factor expression:\n$$\\text{Numerator} = \\int_0^1 T(1-T) \\rho(T) dT = \\int_0^1 T(1-T) \\left( \\frac{g}{2}\\,\\frac{1}{T\\,\\sqrt{1-T}} \\right) dT$$\nThe expression simplifies:\n$$\\text{Numerator} = \\frac{g}{2} \\int_0^1 \\frac{1-T}{\\sqrt{1-T}} dT = \\frac{g}{2} \\int_0^1 \\sqrt{1-T} dT = \\frac{g}{2} \\int_0^1 (1-T)^{1/2} dT$$\nWe compute the integral:\n$$\\int_0^1 (1-T)^{1/2} dT = \\left[ -\\frac{2}{3}(1-T)^{3/2} \\right]_0^1 = \\left( -\\frac{2}{3}(0)^{3/2} \\right) - \\left( -\\frac{2}{3}(1)^{3/2} \\right) = 0 - \\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the numerator:\n$$\\text{Numerator} = \\frac{g}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{g}{3}$$\nFinally, we compute the Fano factor $F$ by taking the ratio of the numerator and the denominator:\n$$F = \\frac{\\text{Numerator}}{\\text{Denominator}} = \\frac{g/3}{g} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nThis is a universal result for phase-coherent diffusive conductors in the limit of many channels.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$$", "id": "2999588"}]}
