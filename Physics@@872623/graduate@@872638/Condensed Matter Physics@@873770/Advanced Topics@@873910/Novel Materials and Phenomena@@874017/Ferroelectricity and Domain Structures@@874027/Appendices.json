Provide only the single expression as your final answer.", "solution": "The problem is to determine the electrostatic energy per unit area stored in the depolarization field of an infinite ferroelectric slab with uniform spontaneous polarization. The derivation must start from fundamental principles.\n\nFirst, we identify the sources of the electric field. In a dielectric material with polarization $\\mathbf{P}$, the bound charge densities are given by the volume density $\\rho_b = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{P}$ and the surface density $\\sigma_b = \\mathbf{P} \\cdot \\hat{n}$, where $\\hat{n}$ is the outward-pointing normal vector from the dielectric surface.\n\nThe problem states that the slab occupies the region $-t/2 \\le z \\le t/2$ and has a uniform spontaneous polarization $\\mathbf{P} = P_s\\,\\hat{z}$. Outside the slab, for $|z|  t/2$, the polarization is zero.\n\nThe volume bound charge density inside the slab is $\\rho_b = -\\nabla \\cdot (P_s\\,\\hat{z}) = -\\frac{\\partial P_s}{\\partial z}$. Since $P_s$ is a constant, $\\rho_b = 0$.\n\nThe surface bound charge density is calculated at the two interfaces.\nAt the top surface, $z = t/2$, the outward normal is $\\hat{n} = \\hat{z}$. The surface charge density is $\\sigma_{b, \\text{top}} = \\mathbf{P} \\cdot \\hat{n} = (P_s\\,\\hat{z}) \\cdot \\hat{z} = P_s$.\nAt the bottom surface, $z = -t/2$, the outward normal is $\\hat{n} = -\\hat{z}$. The surface charge density is $\\sigma_{b, \\text{bottom}} = \\mathbf{P} \\cdot \\hat{n} = (P_s\\,\\hat{z}) \\cdot (-\\hat{z}) = -P_s$.\n\nThus, the polarization creates two infinite sheets of charge: one with density $+P_s$ at $z=t/2$ and another with density $-P_s$ at $z=-t/2$. There are no free charges ($\\rho_{free} = 0$) anywhere.\n\nNext, we find the electric fields. We use Maxwell's equation $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D} = \\rho_{free}$, where $\\mathbf{D}$ is the electric displacement field. Since $\\rho_{free}=0$ everywhere, we have $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D} = 0$. Due to the translational invariance in the $x$-$y$ plane, the vector fields can only depend on the $z$ coordinate, so $\\mathbf{D} = D_z(z)\\,\\hat{z}$. The equation simplifies to $\\frac{dD_z}{dz} = 0$, which implies that $D_z$ is constant throughout all space.\n\nFor open-circuit boundary conditions and no external fields, the fields must vanish at infinity. Thus, as $|z| \\to \\infty$, $\\mathbf{E} \\to \\mathbf{0}$ and $\\mathbf{P} = \\mathbf{0}$, which implies $\\mathbf{D} = \\epsilon_0 \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{P} \\to \\mathbf{0}$. Since $D_z$ is a constant everywhere, it must be that $\\mathbf{D} = \\mathbf{0}$ everywhere.\n\nNow we can find the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ using the constitutive relation $\\mathbf{D} = \\epsilon_0 \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{P}$.\n\nInside the slab ($-t/2  z  t/2$):\n$\\mathbf{0} = \\epsilon_0 \\mathbf{E}_{in} + P_s\\,\\hat{z}$\n$\\mathbf{E}_{in} = -\\frac{P_s}{\\epsilon_0}\\,\\hat{z}$\nThis field, which opposes the polarization, is known as the depolarization field.\n\nOutside the slab ($|z|  t/2$):\n$\\mathbf{0} = \\epsilon_0 \\mathbf{E}_{out} + \\mathbf{0}$\n$\\mathbf{E}_{out} = \\mathbf{0}$\n\nNext, we derive the electrostatic potential $\\phi$ from the relation $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla\\phi$. Due to symmetry, $\\phi$ is only a function of $z$, so $E_z = -\\frac{d\\phi}{dz}$. We can set the potential reference by choosing $\\phi(z)=0$ at $z=0$.\n\nInside the slab ($-t/2 \\le z \\le t/2$):\n$\\frac{d\\phi}{dz} = -E_z = \\frac{P_s}{\\epsilon_0}$\nIntegrating with respect to $z$ from $0$ to $z$:\n$\\phi(z) - \\phi(0) = \\int_0^z \\frac{P_s}{\\epsilon_0} dz'$\n$\\phi(z) = \\frac{P_s}{\\epsilon_0} z$\n\nOutside the slab, for $z  t/2$, $E_z = 0$, so $\\phi(z)$ is constant. The potential must be continuous at the boundary $z=t/2$.\n$\\phi(z) = \\phi(t/2) = \\frac{P_s(t/2)}{\\epsilon_0} = \\frac{P_s t}{2\\epsilon_0}$ for $z \\ge t/2$.\n\nOutside the slab, for $z  -t/2$, $E_z = 0$, so $\\phi(z)$ is constant. The potential must be continuous at the boundary $z=-t/2$.\n$\\phi(z) = \\phi(-t/2) = \\frac{P_s(-t/2)}{\\epsilon_0} = -\\frac{P_s t}{2\\epsilon_0}$ for $z \\le -t/2$.\n\nThe problem requires computing the electrostatic energy density associated with the depolarization field inside the slab. The energy density stored in an electric field in vacuum is given by $u_E = \\frac{1}{2} \\epsilon_0 |\\mathbf{E}|^2$. This expression remains valid for the energy stored in the field itself, even within a material.\n\nInside the slab, the electric field is $\\mathbf{E}_{in} = -\\frac{P_s}{\\epsilon_0}\\,\\hat{z}$. Its magnitude squared is $|\\mathbf{E}_{in}|^2 = \\left(-\\frac{P_s}{\\epsilon_0}\\right)^2 = \\frac{P_s^2}{\\epsilon_0^2}$.\nThe electrostatic energy density inside the slab is therefore:\n$$u_E = \\frac{1}{2} \\epsilon_0 \\left(\\frac{P_s^2}{\\epsilon_0^2}\\right) = \\frac{P_s^2}{2\\epsilon_0}$$\nThis energy density is uniform throughout the slab. Outside the slab, the electric field is zero, so the energy density is zero.\n\nTo find the total electrostatic energy per unit area, denoted $U_A$, we integrate this energy density over the thickness of the slab, from $z=-t/2$ to $z=t/2$.\n$$U_A = \\int_{-t/2}^{t/2} u_E \\,dz$$\nSince $u_E$ is constant within this region:\n$$U_A = u_E \\int_{-t/2}^{t/2} dz = u_E \\cdot \\left[ z \\right]_{-t/2}^{t/2} = u_E \\cdot \\left(\\frac{t}{2} - \\left(-\\frac{t}{2}\\right)\\right) = u_E \\cdot t$$\nSubstituting the expression for $u_E$:\n$$U_A = \\frac{P_s^2}{2\\epsilon_0} \\cdot t = \\frac{P_s^2 t}{2\\epsilon_0}$$\nThis is the total depolarization energy stored per unit area of the ferroelectric slab.

Bulk Spontaneous Polarization**\n\nThe spontaneous polarization, $P_s$, corresponds to the value of the order parameter $P$ that minimizes the bulk free energy density, $f_{bulk}(P)$, in the absence of spatial gradients. The bulk free energy density is given by the terms in the integrand of the Ginzburg-Landau functional that do not involve derivatives:\n$$\nf_{bulk}(P) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}P^{2}+\\frac{\\beta}{4}P^{4}\n$$\nTo find the minima, we first compute the derivative of $f_{bulk}(P)$ with respect to $P$ and set it to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{df_{bulk}}{dP} = \\alpha P + \\beta P^{3} = P(\\alpha + \\beta P^{2}) = 0\n$$\nThis equation has three real solutions for $P$: $P=0$, and $P=\\pm\\sqrt{-\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}}$. The existence of real non-zero solutions is guaranteed by the given conditions $\\alpha0$ and $\\beta0$.\n\nTo determine which of these correspond to stable equilibria (minima), we examine the second derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}f_{bulk}}{dP^{2}} = \\alpha + 3\\beta P^{2}\n$$\nFor $P=0$, the second derivative is $\\alpha$, which is negative. Thus, $P=0$ is a local maximum, representing the unstable high-temperature phase.\nFor $P=\\pm\\sqrt{-\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}}$, the second derivative is:\n$$\n\\alpha + 3\\beta\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right) = \\alpha - 3\\alpha = -2\\alpha\n$$\nSince $\\alpha0$, $-2\\alpha$ is positive, indicating that these two states are the degenerate, stable minima of the free energy. The magnitude of the spontaneous polarization is therefore:\n$$\nP_{s} = \\sqrt{-\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}}\n$$\nThe boundary conditions $P(\\pm\\infty)=\\pm P_{s}$ correctly identify these bulk ground states.

Domain Wall Profile and Width**\n\nThe equilibrium domain wall profile $P(x)$ minimizes the total free energy functional $F[P]$. To find this profile, we use the calculus of variations, which leads to the Euler-Lagrange equation for the integrand (Lagrangian) $L = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}P^{2}+\\frac{\\beta}{4}P^{4}+\\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\left(\\frac{dP}{dx}\\right)^{2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial P} - \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial (dP/dx)}\\right) = 0\n$$\nCalculating the partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial P} = \\alpha P + \\beta P^{3}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial (dP/dx)} = \\kappa \\frac{dP}{dx}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the Euler-Lagrange equation gives the second-order nonlinear differential equation for $P(x)$:\n$$\n\\alpha P + \\beta P^{3} - \\kappa \\frac{d^{2}P}{dx^{2}} = 0\n$$\nThis equation has a first integral, analogous to the conservation of energy in mechanics.

As $x \\to \\pm\\infty$, the system approaches a uniform bulk state, so $\\frac{dP}{dx} \\to 0$ and $P \\to \\pm P_s$. Applying this condition:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}P_{s}^{2} + \\frac{\\beta}{4}P_{s}^{4} + C = f_{bulk}(P_s) + C\n$$\nThus, $C = -f_{bulk}(P_s) = \\frac{\\alpha^{2}}{4\\beta}$. Substituting this back into the first integral:\n$$\n\\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\left(\\frac{dP}{dx}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}P^{2} + \\frac{\\beta}{4}P^{4} + \\frac{\\alpha^{2}}{4\\beta} = \\frac{\\beta}{4}\\left(P^{4} + \\frac{2\\alpha}{\\beta}P^{2} + \\frac{\\alpha^{2}}{\\beta^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{\\beta}{4}\\left(P^{2} + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right)^{2}\n$$\nUsing $P_s^2 = -\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}$, we can write this as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\left(\\frac{dP}{dx}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{\\beta}{4}(P^{2} - P_{s}^{2})^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dx} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta}{2\\kappa}}(P_{s}^{2} - P^{2})\n$$\nWe choose the positive root because $P(x)$ must increase from $-P_s$ to $+P_s$.

Integrating gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{P_{s}}\\arctanh\\left(\\frac{P}{P_{s}}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta}{2\\kappa}} x + C'\n$$\nBy setting the center of the wall at $x=0$ (i.e., $P(0)=0$), the integration constant $C'$ becomes zero. Solving for $P(x)$:\n$$\nP(x) = P_{s} \\tanh\\left(P_{s}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta}{2\\kappa}}x\\right)\n$$\nWe can define a characteristic wall width $\\xi$ such that $P(x) = P_{s} \\tanh(x/\\xi)$.

Enumeration of Ferroelectric Variants ($N_{\\mathrm{var}}$)**\n\nThe parent paraelectric phase has cubic point group symmetry $m\\bar{3}m$ (Laue class $O_h$), which is centrosymmetric.

These three directions are crystallographically equivalent in the cubic phase.\n\nUpon cooling, the ferroelectric phase can form with its unique polar axis (the tetragonal $c$-axis) aligned along any of these three directions. For each of these three possible orientations of the tetragonal axis, the polarization vector $\\boldsymbol{P}$ can point in two opposite directions (e.g., along $[001]$ or $[00\\bar{1}]$).\n\nThe distinct ferroelectric variants (or orientation states) are therefore:\n- Polarization along the $\\pm x$-axis: $\\boldsymbol{P}_x^+$ and $\\boldsymbol{P}_x^-$.\n- Polarization along the $\\pm y$-axis: $\\boldsymbol{P}_y^+$ and $\\boldsymbol{P}_y^-$.\n- Polarization along the $\\pm z$-axis: $\\boldsymbol{P}_z^+$ and $\\boldsymbol{P}_z^-$.\n\nThis gives a total of $3 \\times 2 = 6$ distinct ferroelectric variants.\nHence, the number of variants is $N_{\\mathrm{var}} = 6$.\n\nThis can be confirmed using group theory.

This means that variants with antiparallel polarizations (e.g., $\\boldsymbol{P}_z^+$ and $\\boldsymbol{P}_z^-$) have the same eigenstrain tensor. They are ferroelastically identical. Thus, there are 3 distinct ferroelastic states, each corresponding to a pair of $180^{\\circ}$ ferroelectric variants.\n\nMechanical compatibility of a coherent planar interface between two variants ($1$ and $2$) with eigenstrains $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_1$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_2$ requires that the strain difference, $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_2 - \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_1$, can be written as a symmetrized rank-one tensor:\n$$\n\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{a} \\otimes \\boldsymbol{n} + \\boldsymbol{n} \\otimes \\boldsymbol{a})\n$$\nfor some displacement jump vector $\\boldsymbol{a}$ and interface normal $\\boldsymbol{n}$.

This corresponds to the case $\\boldsymbol{a} = \\mathbf{0}$, which holds for any interface normal $\\boldsymbol{n}$. Thus, from a purely mechanical standpoint, $180^{\\circ}$ domain boundaries are compatible for any orientation.\n\nThe question asks for the number of distinct $180^{\\circ}$ variant pairs. There are three such pairs, one for each of the cubic axes:\n- Pair 1: $(\\boldsymbol{P}_x^+, \\boldsymbol{P}_x^-)$\n- Pair 2: $(\\boldsymbol{P}_y^+, \\boldsymbol{P}_y^-)$\n- Pair 3: $(\\boldsymbol{P}_z^+, \\boldsymbol{P}_z^-)$\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct $180^{\\circ}$ variant pairs is $N_{180} = 3$.\n\n**4. $90^{\\circ}$ Ferroelastic Walls ($N_{90}$)**\n\nA $90^{\\circ}$ wall separates variants whose polarization axes are orthogonal. Let us consider the pair of variants with polarizations along the $x$- and $y$-axes. The corresponding eigenstrains are $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{(x)}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{(y)}$. The strain mismatch is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{(y)} - \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{(x)} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon_{a}-\\varepsilon_{c}  0  0 \\\\ 0  \\varepsilon_{c}-\\varepsilon_{a}  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} = (\\varepsilon_{a}-\\varepsilon_{c}) \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0 \\\\ 0  -1  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe check the compatibility condition for $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$:\n- The trace is $\\mathrm{tr}(\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) = (\\varepsilon_{a}-\\varepsilon_{c}) + (\\varepsilon_{c}-\\varepsilon_{a}) + 0 = 0$.\n- Since $\\varepsilon_{a} \\neq \\varepsilon_{c}$ is given, the matrix has two non-zero diagonal entries. The rank is $\\mathrm{rank}(\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) = 2$.\nThe condition is satisfied, so these variants are mechanically compatible. The possible interface normals $\\boldsymbol{n}$ lie in the plane spanned by the eigenvectors corresponding to the non-zero eigenvalues. The eigenvectors are $[1,0,0]^T$ and $[0,1,0]^T$. The normals are given by the normalized sum and difference of these eigenvectors, $\\boldsymbol{n} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1, \\pm 1, 0)^T$. These correspond to the $(110)$ and $(1\\bar{1}0)$ planes in the parent cubic coordinate system.\n\nBy symmetry, the same analysis applies to the other pairs of variants with orthogonal polarizations:\n- Pair $(y,z)$: $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\propto \\mathrm{diag}(0, 1, -1)$. Compatible. Normals are $(011)$ and $(01\\bar{1})$.\n- Pair $(z,x)$: $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\propto \\mathrm{diag}(-1, 0, 1)$. Compatible. Normals are $(101)$ and $(10\\bar{1})$.\nThe family of interface normals for $90^{\\circ}$ twins is thus the $\\{110\\}$ family of planes of the parent cubic structure.\n\nSince all pairs of variants with orthogonal polarization axes lead to compatible interfaces, we simply need to count the number of such distinct pairs. There are $N_{\\mathrm{var}} = 6$ variants in total. The total number of distinct pairs that can be formed is given by the binomial coefficient:\n$$\n\\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 15\n$$\nThese 15 pairs consist of $180^{\\circ}$ pairs (antiparallel $\\boldsymbol{P}$) and $90^{\\circ}$ pairs (orthogonal $\\boldsymbol{P}$). We have already found that there are $N_{180} = 3$ distinct $180^{\\circ}$ pairs. The remaining pairs must be $90^{\\circ}$ pairs.\nThe number of $90^{\\circ}$ pairs is therefore:\n$$\nN_{90} = \\binom{6}{2} - N_{180} = 15 - 3 = 12\n$$\nThus, there are 12 distinct, mechanically compatible $90^{\\circ}$ twin boundaries.\n\n**Summary of Results**\n- Number of variants: $N_{\\mathrm{var}}=6$\n- Number of $180^{\\circ}$ variant pairs: $N_{180}=3$\n- Number of $90^{\\circ}$ variant pairs: $N_{90}=12$\n\nThe final answer is the row vector $(N_{\\mathrm{var}}, N_{180}, N_{90})$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n6  3  12\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2989518"}]}
