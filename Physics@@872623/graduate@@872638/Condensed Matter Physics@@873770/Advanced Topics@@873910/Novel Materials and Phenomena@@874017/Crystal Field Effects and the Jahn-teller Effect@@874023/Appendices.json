Jahn-Teller Effect (JTE): Symmetry-lowering distortion for orbitally degenerate electronic ground states.\n\nValidation Verdict:\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on established principles of inorganic coordination chemistry, specifically Crystal Field Theory and the Jahn-Teller theorem. All terms are standard and defined correctly. The question is a standard conceptual problem in this field. Thus, the problem is **valid**.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nWe must analyze two possible electronic configurations for a $d^6$ ion in an octahedral field: high-spin and low-spin.\n\n**1. Spin State Determination**\n\nThe preferred spin state is determined by comparing the total energies of the high-spin and low-spin configurations. This energy is a sum of the Crystal Field Stabilization Energy (CFSE) and the total pairing energy.\n\n**a. High-Spin (HS) Configuration**\nFollowing Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity, electrons are placed to maximize the number of unpaired spins. The first $5$ electrons occupy the $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ orbitals singly. The $6^{th}$ electron must pair up in the lowest energy available orbital, a $t_{2g}$ orbital.\nThe configuration is $t_{2g}^{4}e_{g}^{2}$.\n- Number of electrons in $t_{2g}$, $n_{t2g} = 4$.\n- Number of electrons in $e_g$, $n_{eg} = 2$.\nThe CFSE for the high-spin state is:\n$$ \\text{CFSE}_{\\mathrm{HS}} = (4 \\times -0.4\\,\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}}) + (2 \\times +0.6\\,\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}}) = -1.6\\,\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}} + 1.2\\,\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}} = -0.4\\,\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}} $$\nIn this configuration, there is one pair of electrons in a $t_{2g}$ orbital. A free $d^6$ ion also has one electron pair according to Hund's rule. Therefore, there is no *additional* pairing energy cost relative to the free ion. If we denote $N_{HS}$ as the number of electron pairs, $N_{HS}=1$.\n\n**b. Low-Spin (LS) Configuration**\nFollowing the Aufbau principle in a strong field, electrons fill the lowest energy orbitals first. All $6$ electrons occupy the $t_{2g}$ orbitals.\nThe configuration is $t_{2g}^{6}e_{g}^{0}$.\n- Number of electrons in $t_{2g}$, $n_{t2g} = 6$.\n- Number of electrons in $e_g$, $n_{eg} = 0$.\nThe CFSE for the low-spin state is:\n$$ \\text{CFSE}_{\\mathrm{LS}} = (6 \\times -0.4\\,\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}}) + (0 \\times +0.6\\,\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}}) = -2.4\\,\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}} $$\nIn this configuration, the $6$ electrons form $3$ pairs in the $t_{2g}$ orbitals. The number of pairs is $N_{LS}=3$. This represents an increase of $2$ pairs compared to the high-spin state (and the free ion). The energetic cost for this additional pairing is $2P$.\n\n**c. Comparison**\nThe low-spin state is favored if the energy gain from moving electrons to the lower $t_{2g}$ orbitals exceeds the energy cost of pairing them.\nThe energy difference between the states is:\n$$ \\Delta E = E_{\\mathrm{LS}} - E_{\\mathrm{HS}} = (\\text{CFSE}_{\\mathrm{LS}} - \\text{CFSE}_{\\mathrm{HS}}) + (N_{LS} - N_{HS})P $$\n$$ \\Delta E = (-2.4\\,\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}} - (-0.4\\,\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}})) + (3-1)P = -2.0\\,\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}} + 2P $$\nThe low-spin state is favored when $\\Delta E  0$:\n$$ -2.0\\,\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}} + 2P  0 \\implies 2.0\\,\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}}  2P \\implies \\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}}  P $$\nThe high-spin state is favored when $\\Delta E  0$:\n$$ -2.0\\,\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}} + 2P  0 \\implies 2.0\\,\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}}  2P \\implies \\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}}  P $$\nTherefore, a large crystal field splitting ($\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}}  P$) favors the low-spin configuration, whereas a small splitting ($\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}}  P$) favors the high-spin configuration.\n\n**2. Jahn-Teller Effect (JTE) Analysis**\n\nThe Jahn-Teller theorem states that any non-linear molecular system in an electronically degenerate state will undergo a geometric distortion that removes this degeneracy and lowers the overall energy. In the context of octahedral complexes, this means we must check for asymmetric electronic occupation of the $t_{2g}$ or $e_g$ orbitals.\n\n**a. Low-Spin State: $t_{2g}^{6}e_{g}^{0}$**\n- The $t_{2g}$ subshell is completely filled. Each of the three $t_{2g}$ orbitals ($d_{xy}$, $d_{xz}$, $d_{yz}$) contains two electrons. This is a symmetric arrangement.\n- The $e_g$ subshell is empty, which is also a symmetric arrangement.\nSince both subshells are symmetrically occupied, the overall electronic ground state is non-degenerate (specifically, it is a ${}^{1}A_{1g}$ state). Therefore, the low-spin $d^{6}$ configuration is **Jahn-Teller inactive**.\n\n**b. High-Spin State: $t_{2g}^{4}e_{g}^{2}$**\n- The $t_{2g}$ subshell contains four electrons. There are three degenerate $t_{2g}$ orbitals, so this constitutes an asymmetric filling. For instance, a configuration could be $(d_{xy})^2 (d_{xz})^1 (d_{yz})^1$. The orbital degeneracy cannot be avoided.\n- The $e_g$ subshell contains two electrons. Following Hund's rule, they singly occupy the two degenerate $e_g$ orbitals ($d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$). The configuration is $(d_{z^2})^1 (d_{x^2-y^2})^1$. This is a symmetric arrangement.\nThe overall orbital degeneracy of the ground state (a ${}^{5}T_{2g}$ state) arises from the asymmetrically occupied $t_{2g}$ subshell. Therefore, the high-spin $d^{6}$ configuration is **Jahn-Teller active**.\nThe strength of the JTE is proportional to how strongly the involved orbitals interact with the ligands. The $e_g$ orbitals point directly at the ligands, while the $t_{2g}$ orbitals point between them. Consequently, degeneracy in the $e_g$ orbitals ($e.g., d^9$, high-spin $d^4$) leads to a strong JTE, while degeneracy in the $t_{2g}$ orbitals leads to a **weak** JTE.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. When $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}}  P$, the low-spin configuration $t_{2g}^{6}e_{g}^{0}$ is favored; when $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}}  P$, the high-spin configuration $t_{2g}^{4}e_{g}^{2}$ is favored. The low-spin state has an orbitally nondegenerate ground state and is Jahn-Teller inactive, whereas the high-spin state has an orbitally degenerate ground state and can exhibit a weak Jahn-Teller effect arising primarily from $t_{2g}$ degeneracy.**\n    This statement correctly identifies the conditions for high-spin vs. low-spin states. It also correctly states that the low-spin $d^6$ configuration is Jahn-Teller inactive due to its symmetric filling ($t_{2g}^6 e_g^0$). Finally, it correctly identifies the high-spin $d^6$ configuration as having $t_{2g}$ degeneracy ($t_{2g}^4 e_g^2$), leading to a weak Jahn-Teller effect. This option is entirely consistent with our derivation.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. When $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}}  P$, the low-spin configuration $t_{2g}^{6}e_{g}^{0}$ is favored due to stronger CFSE; when $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}}  P$, the high-spin configuration $t_{2g}^{4}e_{g}^{2}$ is favored. The low-spin state is strongly Jahn-Teller active due to uneven $e_{g}$ occupancy, whereas the high-spin state is Jahn-Teller inactive.**\n    This statement incorrectly reverses the relationship between $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}}$ and $P$ for determining the spin state. It also incorrectly assesses the Jahn-Teller activity for both states: the low-spin state is inactive, and the high-spin state is weakly active.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. When $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}}  P$, the high-spin configuration $t_{2g}^{4}e_{g}^{2}$ is favored; when $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}}  P$, the low-spin configuration $t_{2g}^{6}e_{g}^{0}$ is favored. Both spin states are strongly Jahn-Teller active because $e_{g}$ orbitals are involved in the splitting.**\n    This statement incorrectly reverses the spin-state condition. It also incorrectly claims both states are strongly Jahn-Teller active. The low-spin state is inactive, and the high-spin state is only weakly active. The involvement of $e_g$ orbitals in splitting is irrelevant to the JTE; only their occupation matters.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. The spin state is independent of the magnitude of $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}}$ relative to $P$ for $d^{6}$, but only the high-spin state is Jahn-Teller inactive because its $e_{g}$ orbitals are equally singly occupied, whereas the low-spin state is Jahn-Teller active due to $t_{2g}$ degeneracy.**\n    This statement is fundamentally flawed. The spin state of a $d^6$ ion is critically dependent on the relative magnitudes of $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}}$ and $P$. It also reverses the Jahn-Teller activity of the two states: the high-spin state is active and the low-spin state is inactive.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2979021"}, {"introduction": "A key success of crystal field theory is its ability to explain and predict macroscopic properties from microscopic electronic structures.

The analysis will proceed from the fundamental principles of statistical mechanics and perturbation theory as applied to the specified model system.\n\nFirst, we establish the energy level structure of the single $d$-electron system. The problem states that the electron occupies the $t_{2g}$ manifold, which is modeled as an effective orbital angular momentum state with $l=1$. The basis states are denoted by $|m\\rangle$, where $m \\in \\{-1, 0, +1\\}$. A tetragonal elongation along the $z$-axis lifts the degeneracy of this manifold. The doublet $\\{|m=\\pm 1\\rangle\\}$ is lowered in energy, while the singlet $|m=0\\rangle$ is raised. We can set the energy of the ground-state orbital doublet to $E_{\\pm 1} = 0$. The energy of the excited-state orbital singlet is then $E_0 = \\Delta$, with $\\Delta  0$.\n\nThe electron also possesses spin $S=1/2$, with spin quantum number $m_s \\in \\{+1/2, -1/2\\}$. The total state of the electron is thus described by kets of the form $|m, m_s\\rangle$. In the absence of a magnetic field and neglecting spin-orbit coupling as per the problem statement, the energy levels are determined solely by the orbital quantum number $m$.\n\nThe energy spectrum consists of:\n1.  A $4$-fold degenerate ground state manifold with energy $E_{GS} = 0$, comprising the states $\\{|+1, +1/2\\rangle, |+1, -1/2\\rangle, |-1, +1/2\\rangle, |-1, -1/2\\rangle\\}$.\n2.  A $2$-fold degenerate excited state manifold with energy $E_{ES} = \\Delta$, comprising the states $\\{|0, +1/2\\rangle, |0, -1/2\\rangle\\}$.\n\nThe ground-state orbital configuration consists of the degenerate $|m=\\pm 1\\rangle$ orbitals, giving an orbital degeneracy of $2$.\n\nThe magnetic susceptibility tensor $\\chi_{ij}$ relates the induced magnetization $M_i$ to the applied magnetic field $H_j$ (or $B_j$ in SI units). For a system of non-interacting ions, the magnetization is $M_i = N \\langle\\mu_i\\rangle / V$, where $\\langle\\mu_i\\rangle$ is the thermal average of the magnetic moment operator $\\mu_i$. The susceptibility per ion is derived from the Helmholtz free energy per ion, $F = -k_B T \\ln Z$, as $\\chi_{ij} = -\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial B_i \\partial B_j}|_{B=0}$. The partition function is $Z = \\sum_n \\exp(-E_n(B)/k_B T)$, where $E_n(B)$ are the energy eigenvalues in the presence of the field. The Zeeman interaction Hamiltonian is given as $H_Z = \\mu_B \\mathbf{B} \\cdot (\\mathbf{L}/\\hbar + 2\\mathbf{S}/\\hbar)$. We shall use dimensionless operators $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{S}$, so the magnetic moment operator is $\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = -\\partial H_Z / \\partial \\mathbf{B} = -\\mu_B(\\mathbf{L} + 2\\mathbf{S})$.\n\nThe problem operates in the regime $k_B T \\ll \\Delta$, which implies that the thermal population of the excited states is negligible.

This operator is diagonal in the $|m, m_s\\rangle$ basis.

Thus, there is no second-order (Van Vleck) contribution to $\\chi_{\\parallel}$.\n\n**Perpendicular Susceptibility ($\\chi_{\\perp}$)**\n\nFor a magnetic field $\\mathbf{B} = B_x \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, the perturbation is $H_Z = \\mu_B B_x (L_x + 2S_x)$. To find the energies $E_n(B_x)$, we use perturbation theory up to second order in $B_x$. The energy of a state $|n\\rangle$ is $E_n(B_x) = E_n^{(0)} + E_n^{(1)} + E_n^{(2)} + \\dots$.\nThe first-order correction $E^{(1)}$ arises from diagonalizing the perturbation within the degenerate ground-state manifold. The relevant operator is $H'_{GS} = \\mu_B B_x \\langle L_x + 2S_x \\rangle_{GS}$. The operator $L_x = (L_+ + L_-)/2$ only connects states with $\\Delta m = \\pm 1$, so its matrix elements within the $m=\\pm 1$ ground-state manifold are zero. The perturbation within the ground-state manifold is therefore due only to the spin term, $H'_{GS} = 2\\mu_B B_x S_x$. This operator lifts the spin degeneracy. For each orbital state ($m=+1$ and $m=-1$), the spin doublet splits into levels with energies $\\pm \\mu_B B_x$. Thus, the 4-fold degenerate ground state splits into two levels, each 2-fold degenerate, with energies $E^{(1)} = \\pm \\mu_B B_x$.\n\nThe second-order energy correction for a ground state $|n\\rangle$ is $E_n^{(2)} = \\sum_{k \\notin GS} \\frac{|\\langle k|H_Z|n\\rangle|^2}{E_n^{(0)} - E_k^{(0)}}$.\nThe states $|k\\rangle$ are the excited states from the $|m=0\\rangle$ manifold, for which $E_k^{(0)} = \\Delta$. Thus, $E_n^{(0)} - E_k^{(0)} = -\\Delta$.

This computational practice [@problem_id:2979000] moves beyond simple models by incorporating the intra-orbital Hubbard repulsion $U$ and Hund's exchange coupling $J$, key parameters in modern electronic structure methods like DFT+U. By constructing and minimizing a total energy functional that includes crystal field, Jahn-Teller, elastic, and correlation effects, you will quantitatively explore the delicate energy balance that dictates whether a $d^4$ system adopts a high-spin or low-spin state and how the Jahn-Teller effect stabilizes the resulting ground state.", "problem": "Consider a transition-metal ion with $d^4$ electronic configuration in an ideal octahedral environment, modeled by a crystal field that splits the fivefold $d$-shell into the threefold $t_{2g}$ manifold and the twofold $e_g$ manifold. Let the octahedral crystal field splitting be $\\Delta$, with the $t_{2g}$ levels at energy $-2\\Delta/5$ and the $e_g$ levels at energy $+3\\Delta/5$ relative to the $d$-shell barycenter. Incorporate a tetragonal Jahn-Teller distortion mode $Q_3$ that couples linearly to the $e_g$ doublet with coupling constant $g$, such that the $e_g$ levels shift to $+3\\Delta/5 \\mp g Q_3$. The lattice elastic energy is $(k/2) Q_3^2$ with force constant $k$. Include electronic correlations via a simplified density-density interaction energy that captures two fundamental contributions: an intra-orbital Hubbard repulsion $U$ penalizing each doubly-occupied orbital, and a Hund’s exchange $J$ that lowers the energy by $J$ for each pair of parallel spins in different orbitals. Work under constrained occupations representing the two competing spin states:\n- The high-spin configuration $t_{2g}^3 e_g^1$ with total spin $S=2$, having four electrons with parallel spins occupying four distinct orbitals.\n- The low-spin configuration $t_{2g}^4 e_g^0$ with total spin $S=1$, having one doubly occupied $t_{2g}$ orbital and three $t_{2g}$ orbitals containing up spins across three distinct orbitals.\n\nUsing these definitions, and treating $Q_3$ as a classical coordinate, perform the following tasks for each parameter set in the test suite:\n1. Starting from the above crystal-field energies, linear vibronic coupling, and the simplified interaction model, write down the total energy for the high-spin and low-spin states as functions of $Q_3$. The total energy must include the single-particle crystal-field contributions, the Jahn-Teller coupling to $Q_3$, the lattice elastic energy, and the interaction energy contributions from $U$ and $J$ based on the specified occupancy constraints.\n2. Minimize the total energy with respect to $Q_3$ for each spin state to obtain the equilibrium distortion $Q_3^\\ast$ and the corresponding minimized total energy. For the low-spin state, note that there is no $e_g$ occupancy, and thus no linear Jahn-Teller coupling to $Q_3$; the equilibrium distortion is determined solely by the elastic energy and crystal-field contributions under the given constraints.\n3. Define the Jahn-Teller stabilization energy for the high-spin state as $E_{\\mathrm{JT}} = E_{\\mathrm{min}}^{\\mathrm{(HS)}} - E_{Q_3=0}^{\\mathrm{(HS)}}$, where $E_{\\mathrm{min}}^{\\mathrm{(HS)}}$ is the minimized total energy of the high-spin state and $E_{Q_3=0}^{\\mathrm{(HS)}}$ is its total energy evaluated at $Q_3=0$. If the low-spin state is the ground state, report $E_{\\mathrm{JT}} = 0$.\n4. Evaluate the $e_g$ splitting at equilibrium, defined as the difference between the two $e_g$ levels at the equilibrium distortion, and report it for the realized ground state. If the ground state is low spin, report zero $e_g$ splitting, because $Q_3^\\ast = 0$ in this constrained model.\n5. Evaluate the effective crystal-field splitting between the lower $e_g$ level and the $t_{2g}$ level at equilibrium for the realized ground state. For the high-spin state, this splitting is reduced by the Jahn-Teller distortion; for the low-spin state it equals $\\Delta$.\n6. Determine which spin state is the ground state by comparing the minimized total energies. Report an indicator integer equal to $1$ if the Jahn-Teller-active high-spin state is the ground state and $0$ if the low-spin state is the ground state.\n\nAll energies must be expressed in electronvolts (eV). The coupling $g$ is in eV per angstrom (eV/Å), the elastic constant $k$ is in eV per square angstrom (eV/Å$^2$), and the distortion coordinate $Q_3$ is in angstroms (Å).

The model combines crystal field theory, the Jahn-Teller effect, and a simplified treatment of electron-electron interactions ($U$ and $J$) to analyze the competition between a high-spin and a low-spin state for a $d^4$ transition-metal ion.\n\nThe total energy $E$ of the system for a given electronic configuration and distortion coordinate $Q_3$ is the sum of four contributions: the single-particle crystal field energy ($E_{\\mathrm{CF}}$), the electron-electron interaction energy ($E_{\\mathrm{int}}$), the vibronic Jahn-Teller coupling energy ($E_{\\mathrm{JT}}$), and the lattice elastic energy ($E_{\\mathrm{el}}$).\n$$E(Q_3) = E_{\\mathrm{CF}} + E_{\\mathrm{int}} + E_{\\mathrm{JT}}(Q_3) + E_{\\mathrm{el}}(Q_3)$$\n\nWe will formulate this total energy for both the high-spin and low-spin configurations and then minimize it with respect to $Q_3$ to find the stable state. The barycenter of the $d$-orbitals is taken as the zero of energy. The $t_{2g}$ orbitals have energy $-2\\Delta/5$ and the bare $e_g$ orbitals have energy $+3\\Delta/5$.\n\n**1.

The Jahn-Teller distortion splits the $e_g$ doublet into two levels at energies $+3\\Delta/5 \\mp gQ_3$. The single $e_g$ electron will occupy the lower-energy level to achieve stabilization. We can write this stabilized energy as $+3\\Delta/5 - gQ_3$, with the understanding that the system will choose a sign of $Q_3$ (which we can assume to be positive without loss of generality) that makes this energy term minimal. The combined energy of the single-particle terms is thus:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{CF+JT}}^{\\mathrm{(HS)}}(Q_3) = 3 \\left(-\\frac{2\\Delta}{5}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{3\\Delta}{5} - gQ_3\\right) = -\\frac{3\\Delta}{5} - gQ_3$$\n\n- **Interaction Energy**: This configuration has no doubly-occupied orbitals, so the Hubbard $U$ contribution is $0$. There are $4$ parallel-spin electrons, which form $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ pairs. The Hund's exchange energy is thus $-6J$.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{int}}^{\\mathrm{(HS)}} = -6J$$\n\n- **Elastic Energy**: The elastic energy of the lattice due to the distortion is given as $\\frac{1}{2}kQ_3^2$.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{el}}(Q_3) = \\frac{1}{2}kQ_3^2$$\n\n- **Total Energy**: Summing all contributions, the total energy for the high-spin state is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{HS}}(Q_3) = -\\frac{3\\Delta}{5} - 6J - gQ_3 + \\frac{1}{2}kQ_3^2$$\n\nTo find the equilibrium distortion $Q_{3,\\mathrm{HS}}^\\ast$, we minimize $E_{\\mathrm{HS}}(Q_3)$ with respect to $Q_3$:\n$$\\frac{dE_{\\mathrm{HS}}}{dQ_3} = -g + kQ_3 = 0 \\implies Q_{3,\\mathrm{HS}}^\\ast = \\frac{g}{k}$$\nSubstituting this back into the energy expression gives the minimized high-spin energy, $E_{\\mathrm{min}}^{\\mathrm{(HS)}}$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{min}}^{\\mathrm{(HS)}} = -\\frac{3\\Delta}{5} - 6J - g\\left(\\frac{g}{k}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}k\\left(\\frac{g}{k}\\right)^2 = -\\frac{3\\Delta}{5} - 6J - \\frac{g^2}{k} + \\frac{g^2}{2k} = -\\frac{3\\Delta}{5} - 6J - \\frac{g^2}{2k}$$\n\n**2.

There are no electrons in the $e_g$ manifold.\n\n- **Crystal Field and Jahn-Teller Energy**: All $4$ electrons are in the $t_{2g}$ manifold, contributing $4 \\times (-2\\Delta/5) = -8\\Delta/5$. Since there are no $e_g$ electrons, the linear Jahn-Teller coupling term is zero.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{CF+JT}}^{\\mathrm{(LS)}}(Q_3) = -\\frac{8\\Delta}{5}$$\n\n- **Interaction Energy**: There is one doubly-occupied orbital, contributing an energy penalty of $U$. There is one pair of parallel-spin electrons (in two different $t_{2g}$ orbitals), giving an exchange energy of $-J$.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{int}}^{\\mathrm{(LS)}} = U - J$$\n\n- **Elastic Energy**: The elastic term remains $\\frac{1}{2}kQ_3^2$.\n\n- **Total Energy**: The total energy for the low-spin state is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{LS}}(Q_3) = -\\frac{8\\Delta}{5} + U - J + \\frac{1}{2}kQ_3^2$$\nMinimizing with respect to $Q_3$:\n$$\\frac{dE_{\\mathrm{LS}}}{dQ_3} = kQ_3 = 0 \\implies Q_{3,\\mathrm{LS}}^\\ast = 0$$\nThe minimized low-spin energy $E_{\\mathrm{min}}^{\\mathrm{(LS)}}$ is thus the energy at zero distortion:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{min}}^{\\mathrm{(LS)}} = -\\frac{8\\Delta}{5} + U - J$$\n\n**3. Determination of Ground State and Output Quantities**\n\nThe ground state is determined by comparing the minimized energies $E_{\\mathrm{min}}^{\\mathrm{(HS)}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{min}}^{\\mathrm{(LS)}}$. If $E_{\\mathrm{min}}^{\\mathrm{(HS)}} \\leq E_{\\mathrm{min}}^{\\mathrm{(LS)}}$, the high-spin state is the ground state; otherwise, the low-spin state is. The required outputs are calculated based on which state is lower in energy.\n\n- **Ground-State Indicator**: $1$ if HS is the ground state, $0$ if LS is the ground state.\n\n- **Jahn-Teller Stabilization Energy ($E_{\\mathrm{JT}}$)**: Defined as $E_{\\mathrm{JT}} = E_{\\mathrm{min}}^{\\mathrm{(HS)}} - E_{Q_3=0}^{\\mathrm{(HS)}}$.\nThe energy of the HS state at $Q_3=0$ is $E_{Q_3=0}^{\\mathrm{(HS)}} = -3\\Delta/5 - 6J$.\nThus, $E_{\\mathrm{JT}} = \\left(-\\frac{3\\Delta}{5} - 6J - \\frac{g^2}{2k}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{3\\Delta}{5} - 6J\\right) = -\\frac{g^2}{2k}$.\nPer the problem, if the LS state is the ground state, we report $E_{\\mathrm{JT}} = 0$.\n\n- **$e_g$ Splitting at Equilibrium**: The energy difference between the two $e_g$ levels is $(+3\\Delta/5 + gQ_3) - (+3\\Delta/5 - gQ_3) = 2gQ_3$.\nIf HS is the ground state, $Q_3=Q_{3,\\mathrm{HS}}^\\ast=g/k$, so the splitting is $2g(g/k) = 2g^2/k$.\nIf LS is the ground state, $Q_3=Q_{3,\\mathrm{LS}}^\\ast=0$, so the splitting is $0$.\n\n- **Effective Crystal-Field Splitting at Equilibrium**: This is the energy difference between the lower $e_g$ level and the $t_{2g}$ levels at the equilibrium distortion of the ground state.\n$$\\Delta_{\\mathrm{eff}} = E_{e_g, \\text{lower}} - E_{t_{2g}} = \\left(\\frac{3\\Delta}{5} - gQ_3^\\ast\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{2\\Delta}{5}\\right) = \\Delta - gQ_3^\\ast$$\nIf HS is the ground state, $Q_3^\\ast=g/k$, so $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\Delta - g^2/k$.\nIf LS is the ground state, $Q_3^\\ast=0$, so $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\Delta$.\n\n**Summary of Calculation Logic:**\n\n1.
