A small, uniform change in the number density, $\\delta n$, causes the Fermi wavevector to change from $k_F$ to $k_F + \\delta k_F$. The relationship between $\\delta n$ and $\\delta k_F$ for a spin-1/2 system is given by the volume of the new momentum shell:\n$$ \\delta n = 2 \\int_{k_F}^{k_F+\\delta k_F} \\frac{4\\pi k^2 dk}{(2\\pi)^3} \\approx 2 \\frac{4\\pi k_F^2 \\delta k_F}{8\\pi^3} = \\frac{k_F^2}{\\pi^2} \\delta k_F $$\nThe change in chemical potential, $\\delta \\mu$, is the change in the energy of a quasiparticle on the Fermi surface. This change has two components: one from the change in the bare particle energy due to the shift in $k_F$, and one from the change in the interaction energy due to the change in the distribution of all other quasiparticles.\n$$ \\delta \\mu = \\delta \\varepsilon(k_F) $$\nThe change in a quasiparticle's energy with momentum $\\vec{p}$ is given by:\n$$ \\delta \\varepsilon(\\vec{p}) = \\delta \\varepsilon_0(\\vec{p}) + \\sum_{\\vec{p}',\\sigma'} f_{\\vec{p}\\sigma, \\vec{p}'\\sigma'} \\delta n_{\\vec{p}'\\sigma'} $$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_0(\\vec{p})$ is the bare particle energy, $f$ is the Landau interaction function, and $\\delta n_{\\vec{p}'\\sigma'}$ is the change in the quasiparticle distribution function.

Incorrect.** The instability at $F_0^s=-1$ is related to compressibility and density fluctuations, which are governed by the *symmetric* Landau parameter $F_0^s$. The spin instability towards ferromagnetism (Stoner instability) is a different phenomenon governed by the *antisymmetric* Landau parameter $F_0^a$, with the criterion being $1+F_0^a > 0$.

Comparison to a supplied reference and tolerance:\n   - Given a reference value $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, compute the absolute relative difference (as a decimal fraction, not a percentage):\n     $$ \\delta = \\frac{\\left| \\gamma_v - \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\right|}{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ref}}}. $$\n   - Declare the comparison as within tolerance if\n     $$ \\delta \\le 0.05. $$\n\nAlgorithmic steps implemented in the program:\n- Convert all momenta $k$ from $\\mathrm{\\AA}^{-1}$ to $\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ using $1\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^{-1} = 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$.\n- Convert all energies $E$ from $\\mathrm{eV}$ to $\\mathrm{J}$ using $1\\ \\mathrm{eV} = 1.602176634\\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{J}$.\n- Fit a straight line $E(k)$ using the three provided points near $k_F$ to obtain the slope $s = dE/dk$ in $\\mathrm{J\\cdot m}$.\n- Compute the interacting Fermi velocity using $v_F^\\ast = s/\\hbar$.\n- Compute the bare Fermi velocity using $v_F = \\hbar k_F / m$.\n- Compute the effective mass ratio using $m^\\ast/m = v_F / v_F^\\ast$.\n- Compute $F_1^s = 3(m^\\ast/m - 1)$.\n- Compute the interacting density of states $N^\\ast(0) = g\\, m^\\ast k_F /(2\\pi^2 \\hbar^2)$ with $m^\\ast = (m^\\ast/m)\\, m$.\n- Compute $F_0^s = N^\\ast(0)/\\chi_n - 1$.\n- Compute the specific heat coefficient $\\gamma_v = (\\pi^2/3) k_{\\mathrm{B}}^2 N^\\ast(0)$ in $\\mathrm{J\\ m^{-3}\\ K^{-2}}$.\n- Compute the absolute relative difference $\\delta = |\\gamma_v - \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ref}}|/\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ and the boolean pass indicator $\\delta \\le 0.05$.\n- Output, for each case, the list [$m^*/m$, $F_0^s$, $F_1^s$, $Z$, $\\gamma_v$, $\\delta$, pass].\n- Print the three-case results on a single line as a comma-separated list of lists, enclosed in square brackets, in the exact format specified.\n\nThese steps link the QMC-accessible observables $\\chi_n$ and $A(\\mathbf{k},\\omega)$ to the Landau parameters $F_0^s$ and $F_1^s$, the effective mass $m^\\ast/m$, and the specific heat coefficient $\\gamma_v$, enabling a quantitative consistency check against an independently supplied reference.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    # Physical constants (SI units)\n    hbar = 1.054571817e-34  # J·s\n    kB = 1.380649e-23       # J/K\n    m_e = 9.1093837015e-31  # kg\n    eV_to_J = 1.602176634e-19\n    Ainv_to_minv = 1e10\n    g_spin = 2  # spin degeneracy\n\n    # Test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case dict contains:\n    # -
