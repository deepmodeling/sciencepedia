The single-particle states are plane waves characterized by a wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$. The periodic boundary conditions quantize the allowed components of the wavevector along each Cartesian direction $i \\in \\{x, y, z\\}$ as:\n$$\nk_i = \\frac{2\\pi}{L} m_i, \\quad \\text{where } m_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\nThis implies that the allowed $\\mathbf{k}$-vectors form a cubic lattice in $\\mathbf{k}$-space. The separation between adjacent allowed points along any axis is $\\Delta k = \\frac{2\\pi}{L}$.

For a gas of free, non-interacting electrons, the energy of a state with wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ is given by $E(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 |\\mathbf{k}|^2}{2m_e}$. The condition $E(\\mathbf{k}) \\le E_F$ defines a sphere in $\\mathbf{k}$-space of radius $k_F$, where $k_F$ is the Fermi wavevector. This sphere, known as the Fermi sphere, contains all the occupied orbital states at $T=0$.\n\nWe can calculate the total number of occupied orbital states, $N_{orb}$, by determining how many allowed $\\mathbf{k}$-vectors fit inside the Fermi sphere. In the thermodynamic limit (large $L$), the discrete points are dense enough that we can find this number by dividing the volume of the Fermi sphere by the volume per state, $V_{\\mathbf{k}}$. The volume of the Fermi sphere is $V_{sphere} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3$.\n$$\nN_{orb} = \\frac{V_{sphere}}{V_{\\mathbf{k}}} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3}{(2\\pi)^3 / V} = V \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3}{8\\pi^3} = V \\frac{k_F^3}{6\\pi^2}\n$$\nAlternatively, one can use the continuum limit formalism from the start, where the sum over states is replaced by an integral over $\\mathbf{k}$-space: $\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\to \\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^3} \\int d^3k$. The number of orbital states is then:\n$$\nN_{orb} = \\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^3} \\int_{|\\mathbf{k}| \\le k_F} d^3k = \\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^3} \\left(\\text{Volume of Fermi sphere}\\right) = \\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^3} \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3\\right) = V \\frac{k_F^3}{6\\pi^2}\n$$\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nElectrons are spin-1/2 fermions, so each orbital state $\\mathbf{k}$ can be occupied by two electrons, one with spin up and one with spin down. This is a spin degeneracy factor of $g_s = 2$. The total number of electrons, $N$, is therefore twice the number of occupied orbital states:\n$$\nN = g_s N_{orb} = 2 \\cdot \\left(V \\frac{k_F^3}{6\\pi^2}\\right) = V \\frac{k_F^3}{3\\pi^2}\n$$\nThe particle number density is $n = N/V$. Dividing the expression for $N$ by the volume $V$, we obtain the fundamental relationship between the electron density $n$ and the Fermi wavevector $k_F$:\n$$\nn = \\frac{N}{V} = \\frac{k_F^3}{3\\pi^2}\n$$\nFrom this relationship, we can solve explicitly for $k_F$ in terms of $n$:\n$$\nk_F^3 = 3\\pi^2 n \\implies k_F = (3\\pi^2 n)^{1/3}\n$$\nThis is the first required part of the answer.\n\nNext, we evaluate the dimensionless ratio $R \\equiv \\frac{n}{2\\,V_F\\,(2\\pi)^{-3}}$. The problem defines $V_F$ as the $\\mathbf{k}$-space volume enclosed by the Fermi surface. For this system, the Fermi surface is a sphere of radius $k_F$. The enclosed volume $V_F$ is thus the volume of the Fermi sphere:\n$$\nV_F = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{n}{2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3\\right) \\cdot (2\\pi)^{-3}} = \\frac{n}{\\frac{8}{3}\\pi k_F^3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8\\pi^3}} = \\frac{n}{\\frac{k_F^3}{3\\pi^2}}\n$$\nWe now use the relationship $n = \\frac{k_F^3}{3\\pi^2}$ that we derived earlier.

This can be achieved through a direct state-counting argument.\n\nLet $N$ be the total number of unit cells in the two-dimensional crystal. The crystal has a real-space area of $A_{\\mathrm{crystal}} = N a^2$, where $a$ is the lattice constant. In reciprocal space (k-space), the allowed wavevectors $\\mathbf{k}$ are discrete due to the imposition of periodic boundary conditions. The area associated with each discrete $\\mathbf{k}$-point is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta A_k = \\frac{(2\\pi)^2}{A_{\\mathrm{crystal}}} = \\frac{(2\\pi)^2}{N a^2}\n$$\nThe area of the first Brillouin Zone is given as $A_{\\mathrm{BZ}} = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^2$.

Each of these orbital states can be occupied by two electrons, one with spin up and one with spin down, due to the spin-1/2 nature of electrons. Therefore, a completely filled band accommodates $2N$ electrons.\n\nThe electron filling $n$ is defined as the total number of electrons per unit cell. For a crystal with $N$ unit cells, the total number of electrons is $N_e = n N$.\n\nThe problem specifies a system with no broken symmetries, implying no spin polarization. Consequently, the number of spin-up electrons, $N_{\\uparrow}$, is equal to the number of spin-down electrons, $N_{\\downarrow}$:\n$$\nN_{\\uparrow} = N_{\\downarrow} = \\frac{N_e}{2} = \\frac{nN}{2}\n$$\nAt zero temperature ($T=0$), electrons occupy the lowest available energy states. In k-space, these states are all those with wavevectors $\\mathbf{k}$ inside the Fermi Surface. The problem defines $A_{\\mathrm{F}}$ as the area in k-space enclosed by the FS for a single spin species. Since the bands are identical for both spins, the FS is the same for spin-up and spin-down electrons.\n\nThe number of occupied states for a single spin species (e.g., spin-up) is found by dividing the k-space area $A_{\\mathrm{F}}$ by the area per $\\mathbf{k}$-state, $\\Delta A_k$:\n$$\nN_{\\uparrow} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{F}}}{\\Delta A_k} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{F}}}{\\frac{(2\\pi)^2}{N a^2}} = A_{\\mathrm{F}} \\frac{N a^2}{(2\\pi)^2}\n$$\nBy equating the two expressions for $N_{\\uparrow}$, we connect the particle number to the FS geometry:\n$$\n\\frac{nN}{2} = A_{\\mathrm{F}} \\frac{N a^2}{(2\\pi)^2}\n$$\nThe factor $N$ cancels from both sides, yielding a relation between intensive quantities:\n$$\n\\frac{n}{2} = A_{\\mathrm{F}} \\frac{a^2}{(2\\pi)^2}\n$$\nWe need to find the ratio $A_{\\mathrm{F}}/A_{\\mathrm{BZ}}$. We can rearrange the above expression as:\n$$\n\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{F}}}{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^2} = \\frac{n}{2}\n$$\nRecognizing that $A_{\\mathrm{BZ}} = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^2$, we obtain the desired general relation:\n$$\n\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{F}}}{A_{\\mathrm{BZ}}} = \\frac{n}{2}\n$$\nThis derivation uses only state-counting and particle conservation, and as such, the result is independent of the specific energy dispersion $E(\\mathbf{k})$, as required.\n\nThis result is consistent with the Luttinger sum rule. Luttinger's theorem states that for a Fermi liquid, the k-space volume enclosed by the Fermi surface is determined by the particle density, independent of interactions. For a 2D system, the particle density $\\rho = N_e / A_{\\mathrm{crystal}}$ is related to the Fermi area $A_{\\mathrm{F}}$ by $\\rho = g_s \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{F}}}{(2\\pi)^2}$, where $g_s$ is the spin degeneracy factor. For spin-1/2 electrons, $g_s=2$. Our density is $\\rho = \\frac{nN}{Na^2} = \\frac{n}{a^2}$. Substituting this into the Luttinger relation gives $\\frac{n}{a^2} = 2 \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{F}}}{(2\\pi)^2}$, which rearranges to $\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{F}}}{(2\\pi)^2/a^2} = \\frac{n}{2}$, or $\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{F}}}{A_{\\mathrm{BZ}}} = \\frac{n}{2}$. This confirms our state-counting argument is the non-interacting embodiment of the more general theorem.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of the FS area fraction for the given electron filling $n=0.8$:\n$$\n\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{F}}}{A_{\\mathrm{BZ}}} = \\frac{0.8}{2} = 0.4\n$$\nThe area of the Fermi sea for a single spin species occupies $40\\%$ of the Brillouin zone area.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.4}\n$$", "id": "3002383"}, {"introduction": "Luttinger's theorem is a cornerstone of Fermi liquid theory, which presupposes the existence of a sharp Fermi surface.
