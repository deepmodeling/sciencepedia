This problem challenges you to extend the Thomas-Fermi framework to a non-electric perturbation—a static magnetic moment. By treating the spin-up and spin-down electrons as separate fluids, you will determine whether the electron gas response acts to weaken (screen) or enhance the magnetic field, providing critical insight into the limits of the screening concept and the nature of magnetic response in metals [@problem_id:1118787].", "problem": "Consider a three-dimensional, non-relativistic, homogeneous electron gas at zero temperature. The electrons are treated as non-interacting, except for their response to external potentials via the constraints of the Thomas-Fermi (TF) approximation. In the standard TF model, the electronic properties at each point $\\mathbf{r}$ are assumed to be those of a local uniform electron gas with a density $n(\\mathbf{r})$, determined by a local Fermi wavevector $k_F(\\mathbf{r})$. The central tenet of the theory is that the chemical potential $\\mu$ must be constant throughout the system in equilibrium.\n\nNow, a static, localized magnetic moment is introduced at the origin, creating a position-dependent external magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}_{ext}(\\mathbf{r})$. We align our coordinate system such that the local field is $\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{r}) = B(\\mathbf{r}) \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The field couples to the electron spins via the Zeeman interaction, adding a spin-dependent potential energy term $V_{spin} = \\mp \\mu_B B(\\mathbf{r})$, where $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, and the signs correspond to spin-up ($\\uparrow$) and spin-down ($\\downarrow$) electrons, respectively.\n\nThis spin-dependent potential causes the electron gas to become spin-polarized. We can treat the spin-up and spin-down populations as two separate fluids, each obeying the Thomas-Fermi condition. The chemical potential $\\mu$ is the same for both populations. The TF condition for each spin species $\\sigma \\in \\{\\uparrow, \\downarrow\\}$ is:\n$$ \\mu = E_{F,\\sigma}(\\mathbf{r}) + V_\\sigma(\\mathbf{r}) $$\nwhere $E_{F,\\sigma}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k_{F,\\sigma}^2(\\mathbf{r})}{2m_e}$ is the local Fermi kinetic energy for spin $\\sigma$, and $V_\\sigma(\\mathbf{r})$ is the potential energy for that spin species.
