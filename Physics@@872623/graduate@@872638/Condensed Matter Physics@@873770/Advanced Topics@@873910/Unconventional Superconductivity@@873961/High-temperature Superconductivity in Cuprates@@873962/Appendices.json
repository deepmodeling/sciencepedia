The product of Green's functions is:\n$$\nG(\\mathbf{k}', i\\omega_m) G(-\\mathbf{k}', -i\\omega_m) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_m - \\xi_{\\mathbf{k}'}} \\frac{1}{-i\\omega_m - \\xi_{-\\mathbf{k}'}} = \\frac{1}{-\\omega_m^2 - \\xi_{\\mathbf{k}'}^2}\n$$\nwhere we used $\\xi_{-\\mathbf{k}'} = \\xi_{\\mathbf{k}'}$ for a centrosymmetric system.\n\nThe summation over momentum $\\mathbf{k}'$ can be converted to an integral over energy and an average over the Fermi surface (FS), using the constant density of states $N(0)$ (per spin per unit energy):\n$$\n\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}'} \\rightarrow N(0) \\int d\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}'} \\langle \\dots \\rangle_{\\mathrm{FS}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the gap equation:\n$$\n\\Delta(\\mathbf{k}, i\\omega_n) = T_c \\sum_m N(0) \\int d\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}'} \\left\\langle V(\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}', i\\omega_n - i\\omega_m) \\frac{\\Delta(\\mathbf{k}', i\\omega_m)}{\\omega_m^2 + \\xi_{\\mathbf{k}'}^2} \\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{FS}}\n$$\nThe integral over $\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}'}$ is standard:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d\\xi \\frac{1}{\\omega_m^2 + \\xi^2} = \\left[ \\frac{1}{|\\omega_m|} \\arctan\\left( \\frac{\\xi}{|\\omega_m|} \\right) \\right]_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} = \\frac{\\pi}{|\\omega_m|}\n$$\nThe gap equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Delta(\\mathbf{k}, i\\omega_n) = \\pi T_c N(0) \\sum_m \\frac{1}{|\\omega_m|} \\left\\langle V(\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}', i\\omega_n - i\\omega_m) \\Delta(\\mathbf{k}', i\\omega_m) \\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{FS}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a separable interaction potential with $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry:\n$$\nV(\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}', i\\Omega_l) = -\\frac{3}{2} g^{2}\\, \\chi_{Q}\\, \\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}^{2}}{\\Omega_l^{2} + \\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}^{2}}\\, \\varphi_{\\mathbf{k}} \\varphi_{\\mathbf{k}'}\n$$\nwhere $\\Omega_l = \\omega_n - \\omega_m$ is a bosonic Matsubara frequency, and $\\varphi_{\\mathbf{k}} = \\cos k_x - \\cos k_y$. The real-frequency form $\\omega^2 + \\omega_{sf}^2$ becomes $\\Omega_l^2 + \\omega_{sf}^2$ for the retarded interaction in Matsubara space.\nThis separable interaction suggests a separable gap function of the form $\\Delta(\\mathbf{k}, i\\omega_n) = \\Delta(i\\omega_n) \\varphi_{\\mathbf{k}}$. Substituting the separable forms for $V$ and $\\Delta$:\n$$\n\\Delta(i\\omega_n) \\varphi_{\\mathbf{k}} = \\pi T_c N(0) \\sum_m \\frac{1}{|\\omega_m|} \\left\\langle \\left( -\\frac{3}{2} g^{2}\\, \\chi_{Q}\\, \\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}^{2}}{(\\omega_n-\\omega_m)^{2} + \\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}^{2}}\\, \\varphi_{\\mathbf{k}} \\varphi_{\\mathbf{k}'} \\right) \\Delta(i\\omega_m) \\varphi_{\\mathbf{k}'} \\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{FS}}\n$$\nThe Fermi-surface average acts on the $\\mathbf{k}'$-dependent terms:\n$$\n\\Delta(i\\omega_n) \\varphi_{\\mathbf{k}} = -\\left(\\frac{3}{2} g^{2}\\, \\chi_{Q}\\right) \\pi T_c N(0) \\varphi_{\\mathbf{k}} \\sum_m \\frac{\\Delta(i\\omega_m)}{|\\omega_m|} \\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}^{2}}{(\\omega_n-\\omega_m)^{2} + \\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}^{2}} \\langle \\varphi_{\\mathbf{k}'}^{2} \\rangle_{\\mathrm{FS}}\n$$\nCanceling the non-zero form factor $\\varphi_{\\mathbf{k}}$ from both sides and defining the dimensionless effective coupling constant $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}} = N(0) \\langle \\varphi_{\\mathbf{k}}^{2} \\rangle_{\\mathrm{FS}} \\left( \\frac{3}{2} g^2 \\chi_Q \\right)$, we obtain an equation for the frequency dependence of the gap:\n$$\n\\Delta(i\\omega_n) = -\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\pi T_c \\sum_m \\frac{\\Delta(i\\omega_m)}{|\\omega_m|} \\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}^{2}}{(\\omega_n-\\omega_m)^{2} + \\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}^{2}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a singlet pairing channel, for which the gap function is an even function of frequency, $\\Delta(i\\omega_n) = \\Delta(-i\\omega_n)$. In terms of indices, this means $\\Delta_{n} = \\Delta_{-n-1}$. Using this symmetry, the sum over all integers $m$ can be folded into a sum over non-negative integers. This yields the standard form of the Eliashberg equation on the imaginary axis (with mass renormalization $Z=1$, as instructed):\n$$\n\\Delta(i\\omega_n) = \\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\pi T_c \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{\\Delta(i\\omega_m)}{\\omega_m} \\left( \\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}^2}{(\\omega_n-\\omega_m)^2 + \\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}^2} + \\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}^2}{(\\omega_n+\\omega_m)^2 + \\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}^2} \\right)\n$$\nTo find $T_c$, we seek the temperature at which this equation has a non-trivial solution. This is an eigenvalue problem where we need to find $T_c$ such that the largest eigenvalue is $1$.\nUnder the weak-coupling assumption ($T_c \\ll \\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}$), the interaction kernel is slowly varying for small frequencies. This suggests approximating the gap function as constant, $\\Delta(i\\omega_m) \\approx \\Delta_0$, for the frequencies that contribute most to the sum. The equation then becomes an algebraic condition for $T_c$:\n$$\n1 \\approx \\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\pi T_c \\sum_m \\frac{1}{|\\omega_m|} \\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}^{2}}{(\\omega_n-\\omega_m)^{2} + \\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}^{2}}\n$$\nChoosing the lowest frequency $n=0$:\n$$\n1 = \\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\pi T_c \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{1}{|\\omega_m|} \\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}^{2}}{\\omega_m^2 + \\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}^{2}} = 2 \\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\pi T_c \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\omega_m} \\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}^{2}}{\\omega_m^2 + \\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}^{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\omega_m = (2m+1)\\pi T_c$:\n$$\n1 = 2 \\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2m+1} \\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}^{2}}{((2m+1)\\pi T_c)^2 + \\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}^{2}}\n$$\nIn the weak-coupling limit, $T_c \\ll \\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}$. The second term in the sum is approximately $1$ for frequencies $(2m+1)\\pi T_c \\ll \\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}$ and decays for higher frequencies. We can thus approximate the sum by cutting it off at a frequency corresponding to the energy scale of the pairing boson, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}$. The cutoff index $m_{\\mathrm{max}}$ is defined by $(2m_{\\mathrm{max}}+1)\\pi T_c \\approx \\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}$, so $m_{\\mathrm{max}} \\approx \\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}}{2\\pi T_c}$.\n$$\n1 \\approx 2 \\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\sum_{m=0}^{m_{\\mathrm{max}}} \\frac{1}{2m+1}\n$$\nUsing the asymptotic expansion for the partial sum, $\\sum_{m=0}^{M} \\frac{1}{2m+1} \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(4M) + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}$ for large $M$, where $\\gamma \\approx 0.577$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant:\n$$\n1 \\approx 2 \\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(4m_{\\mathrm{max}}) + \\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\right) = \\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}} (\\ln(4m_{\\mathrm{max}}) + \\gamma)\n$$\nSubstituting $m_{\\mathrm{max}} \\approx \\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}}{2\\pi T_c}$:\n$$\n1 \\approx \\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\left( \\ln\\left(\\frac{2\\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}}{\\pi T_c}\\right) + \\gamma \\right) = \\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{2e^\\gamma \\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}}{\\pi T_c}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for $T_c$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{2e^\\gamma \\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}}{\\pi T_c}\\right) \\implies T_c = \\frac{2e^\\gamma}{\\pi} \\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\\right)\n$$\nThe prefactor is $\\frac{2e^\\gamma}{\\pi} \\approx 1.134$. This is the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) form of the transition temperature, with the mediating boson energy $\\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}}$ acting as the effective frequency cutoff.\n\nNow we compute the numerical values. First, we unify the units.\n$\\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}} = 50\\,\\mathrm{meV} = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\nThe dimensionless coupling constant $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}} = N(0) \\langle \\varphi_{\\mathbf{k}}^{2} \\rangle_{\\mathrm{FS}} \\left( \\frac{3}{2} g^2 \\chi_Q \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}} = (1.0\\,\\mathrm{eV}^{-1}) \\cdot (0.6) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{3}{2} (0.6\\,\\mathrm{eV})^2 (1.5\\,\\mathrm{eV}^{-1}) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 0.6 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 0.36\\,\\mathrm{eV}^2 \\cdot 1.5\\,\\mathrm{eV}^{-1} \\right) = 0.6 \\cdot (0.81) = 0.486\n$$\nNow, we compute $T_c$ in units of eV:\n$$\nT_c = \\frac{2e^\\gamma}{\\pi} \\omega_{\\mathrm{sf}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\\right) \\approx 1.134 \\cdot (0.05\\,\\mathrm{eV}) \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{0.486}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nT_c \\approx 0.0567 \\cdot \\exp(-2.0576) \\approx 0.0567 \\cdot 0.12776 \\approx 0.007245\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nFinally, we convert $T_c$ to Kelvin using the provided conversion factor $1\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 1.16045 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{K}$ (implicitly containing $k_B$):\n$$\nT_c[\\text{K}] = T_c[\\text{eV}] \\times \\frac{1.16045 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\text{K}}{1\\,\\text{eV}}\n$$\n$$\nT_c[\\text{K}] \\approx 0.007245 \\times 11604.5\\,\\text{K} \\approx 84.076\\,\\text{K}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $T_c = 84.1\\,\\mathrm{K}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{84.1}$$", "id": "2994197"}]}
