Since we derived $\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{powder}} = 2/3$, a constant value, the magnetic intensity for any reflection depends only on the magnitude of the scattering vector $Q$ (through the form factor and structure factor magnitude) but not on the absolute orientation of the moments.\nIf two magnetic structures differ only in the absolute direction of $\\hat{\\mathbf{m}}$ (e.g., moments along $\\hat{\\mathbf{a}}$ vs. moments along $\\hat{\\mathbf{c}}$), the calculated powder diffraction patterns will be identical. For the two specified reflections $\\mathbf{G}_1$ and $\\mathbf{G}_2$, since $|F_{\\mathrm{mag}}(\\mathbf{G}_1)| = |F_{\\mathrm{mag}}(\\mathbf{G}_2)|$, the ratio of their intensities $I_1/I_2$ will simply be the ratio of their crystallographic multiplicities, regardless of the moment direction.\nThis implies a fundamental limitation: **it is impossible to determine the absolute direction of the ordered moment in a collinear magnetic structure from an unpolarized neutron powder diffraction experiment alone.**\n\n3) Auxiliary Strategies to Resolve the Ambiguity\n\nTo determine the absolute moment direction, one must break the isotropic averaging.\n*   **Strategy 1: Single Crystal Neutron Diffraction.** A single crystal fixes the orientation of the lattice. The intensity's dependence on $\\sin^2(\\alpha)$ can be used to test different models for $\\hat{\\mathbf{m}}$. For example, if a model proposes $\\hat{\\mathbf{m}} \\parallel \\hat{\\mathbf{c}}$, it would predict zero intensity for all $(00l)$ magnetic reflections since $\\mathbf{Q}$ would be parallel to $\\hat{\\mathbf{m}}$, making $\\alpha=0$. Observing these systematic extinctions would confirm the model.\n*   **Strategy 2: Application of a Magnetic Field to a Powder Sample.** An external magnetic field breaks the orientational isotropy of the magnetic domains. The field will preferentially align domains based on the material's magnetic anisotropy. This creates a texture in the moment orientations relative to the lab frame. The powder average is no longer isotropic, and the polarization factor becomes dependent on the angle between $\\mathbf{Q}$ and the applied field $\\mathbf{H}$. Comparing intensities of the same peak with $\\mathbf{Q} \\parallel \\mathbf{H}$ and $\\mathbf{Q} \\perp \\mathbf{H}$ reveals information about the anisotropy and thus the zero-field moment direction.\n*   **Strategy 3: Polarized Neutron Diffraction.** By using polarized neutrons, one can access interference terms between nuclear and magnetic scattering.
