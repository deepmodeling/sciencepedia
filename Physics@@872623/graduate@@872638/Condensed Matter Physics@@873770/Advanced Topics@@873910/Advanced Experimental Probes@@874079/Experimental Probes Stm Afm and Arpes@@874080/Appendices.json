This practice ([@problem_id:2988548]) involves deriving this relationship for a two-dimensional system and applying it to ARPES data, demonstrating how to directly count the mobile charge carriers in a material from a momentum-space map.", "problem": "Consider a two-dimensional electron system probed by Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES). ARPES maps the Fermi surface contour in the two-dimensional Brillouin zone, providing a set of points in reciprocal space that approximate the boundary separating occupied and unoccupied states at zero temperature. Assume periodic boundary conditions in a square sample of side length $L$, so that allowed crystal momenta are quantized as $\\mathbf{k} = \\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\mathbf{n}$ with integer components. The density of $\\mathbf{k}$-states per unit area in reciprocal space follows from this quantization. Each $\\mathbf{k}$-state carries a degeneracy factor $g \\equiv g_s g_v$, where $g_s$ is the spin degeneracy and $g_v$ is any additional valley or band degeneracy that duplicates the Fermi pockets.\n\nStarting from the definitions above and fundamental state-counting arguments, derive the relation between the enclosed Fermi surface area and the carrier density for a two-dimensional system. Treat both electron-like pockets (where the Fermi surface encloses occupied states) and hole-like pockets (where the Fermi surface encloses unoccupied states near the top of a band) consistently by interpreting the ARPES-measured pocket area as the measure of mobile carriers (electrons for electron-like pockets, holes for hole-like pockets). Your derivation must begin from the stated quantization of $\\mathbf{k}$-states and end with an expression that depends only on the enclosed area in reciprocal space and the degeneracy $g$.\n\nYour program must implement the following computational steps:\n- Given ARPES-measured Fermi surface contours in two dimensions, compute the enclosed area in reciprocal space using appropriate geometry. When contours are described by a set of ordered points in $\\mathbf{k}$-space, use a robust polygon area computation. When contours are described analytically (e.g., circle or ellipse), use exact geometric formulas for area to avoid discretization error.\n- Convert all reciprocal space quantities to International System of Units (SI).

The core of the problem is to derive and apply the relationship between the carrier density of a two-dimensional electron gas and the area enclosed by its Fermi surface in reciprocal space.\n\nThe derivation begins from the quantization of crystal momentum $\\mathbf{k}$ in a finite system with periodic boundary conditions. For a two-dimensional square sample of side length $L$, the allowed momentum vectors are given by:\n$$ \\mathbf{k} = (k_x, k_y) = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{L}n_x, \\frac{2\\pi}{L}n_y \\right) $$\nwhere $n_x$ and $n_y$ are integers. These allowed $\\mathbf{k}$-vectors form a uniform square grid in the reciprocal plane. The spacing between adjacent points is $\\Delta k = \\frac{2\\pi}{L}$ along each axis. The area in reciprocal space associated with a single unique orbital $\\mathbf{k}$-state is therefore:\n$$ A_{\\text{state}} = \\Delta k_x \\Delta k_y = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{L} \\right)^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{L^2} $$\nThe real-space area of the sample is $A = L^2$, so we can write the area per $\\mathbf{k}$-state as $A_{\\text{state}} = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{A}$. This means the density of orbital states in reciprocal space is $\\frac{1}{A_{\\text{state}}} = \\frac{A}{4\\pi^2}$.\n\nAt zero temperature, all states with energy below the Fermi energy are occupied, and those above are empty. The Fermi surface is the contour of constant energy $E_F$ that separates occupied from unoccupied states in $\\mathbf{k}$-space. For an electron-like pocket, the Fermi surface encloses occupied states. The total number of occupied orbital states, $N_{\\text{orb}}$, is found by integrating the density of states over the area $A_k$ enclosed by the Fermi surface:\n$$ N_{\\text{orb}} = \\iint_{A_k} \\frac{d^2k}{A_{\\text{state}}} = \\frac{1}{A_{\\text{state}}} \\iint_{A_k} d^2k = \\frac{A_k}{A_{\\text{state}}} = \\frac{A_k A}{4\\pi^2} $$\nFor a hole-like pocket, the Fermi surface encloses unoccupied states within an otherwise filled band. The area $A_k$ corresponds to the missing electrons, which are equivalent to the number of hole carriers. The counting argument remains identical for determining the number of holes.\n\nEach orbital $\\mathbf{k}$-state can have additional degeneracies. The problem specifies a total degeneracy factor $g = g_s g_v$, where $g_s$ is the spin degeneracy and $g_v$ is the valley or band degeneracy. Thus, the total number of carriers (electrons or holes), $N_{\\text{carriers}}$, is:\n$$ N_{\\text{carriers}} = g \\times N_{\\text{orb}} = g \\frac{A_k A}{4\\pi^2} $$\nThe carrier density, $n$, is the number of carriers per unit area in real space. It is an intensive quantity and should not depend on the sample size $L$ (or $A$).\n$$ n = \\frac{N_{\\text{carriers}}}{A} = \\frac{1}{A} \\left( g \\frac{A_k A}{4\\pi^2} \\right) $$\nThe real-space area $A$ cancels, yielding the final, fundamental relationship:\n$$ n = g \\frac{A_k}{4\\pi^2} $$\nThis expression connects the macroscopic carrier density $n$ to the microscopic Fermi surface area $A_k$ and is valid for both electron and hole pockets, where $A_k$ is the area of the respective pocket.\n\nTo solve the problem computationally, this formula is applied to each test case.\nFirst, the area $A_k$ must be calculated in units of $\\mathrm{\\AA}^{-2}$.\n- For a circular pocket of radius $k_F$, the area is $A_k = \\pi k_F^2$.\n- For an elliptical pocket with semi-axes $k_x$ and $k_y$, the area is $A_k = \\pi k_x k_y$.\n- For a pocket described by an ordered set of vertices $(k_{x,i}, k_{y,i})$, the area is calculated using the Shoelace formula for a polygon: $A_k = \\frac{1}{2} |\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (k_{x,i} k_{y,i+1} - k_{x,i+1} k_{y,i})|$, where the $(N+1)$-th vertex is the same as the first.\n\nSecond, the area $A_k$ is converted from $\\mathrm{\\AA}^{-2}$ to SI units ($\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$) using the conversion factor $1\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}^{-2} = (10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1})^2 = 10^{20}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$.\n\nFinally, the carrier density $n$ in $\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$ is computed using the derived formula with the SI value for $A_k$ and the given total degeneracy $g = g_s g_v$.
