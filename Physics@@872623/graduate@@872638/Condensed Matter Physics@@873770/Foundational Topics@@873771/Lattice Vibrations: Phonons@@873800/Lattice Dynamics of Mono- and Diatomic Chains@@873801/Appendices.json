We substitute the given ansatz, $u_n(t) = u \\exp(i k n a - i \\omega t)$ and $v_n(t) = v \\exp(i k n a - i \\omega t)$, into the equations of motion. The time derivatives are $\\ddot{u}_n = -\\omega^2 u_n$ and $\\ddot{v}_n = -\\omega^2 v_n$. The displacements in adjacent and previous unit cells are related by a phase factor: $u_{n+1} = u_n \\exp(ika)$ and $v_{n-1} = v_n \\exp(-ika)$.\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for $u_n$:\n$$-m\\omega^2 u_n = -(K_s+K_w)u_n + K_s v_n + K_w v_n \\exp(-ika)$$\nDividing by the common factor $\\exp(ikna - i\\omega t)$:\n$$-m\\omega^2 u = -(K_s+K_w)u + (K_s + K_w \\exp(-ika))v$$\n$$(K_s+K_w-m\\omega^2)u - (K_s + K_w \\exp(-ika))v = 0$$\n\nSubstituting into the equation for $v_n$:\n$$-m\\omega^2 v_n = K_s u_n + K_w u_n \\exp(ika) - (K_s+K_w)v_n$$\nDividing by the common factor $\\exp(ikna - i\\omega t)$:\n$$-m\\omega^2 v = (K_s + K_w \\exp(ika))u - (K_s+K_w)v$$\n$$-(K_s + K_w \\exp(ika))u + (K_s+K_w-m\\omega^2)v = 0$$\n\nThese two homogeneous linear equations for the amplitudes $u$ and $v$ can be written as a $2 \\times 2$ eigenvalue problem:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nK_s + K_w  -(K_s + K_w e^{-ika}) \\\\\n-(K_s + K_w e^{ika})  K_s + K_w\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} u \\\\ v \\end{pmatrix}\n= m \\omega^2\n\\begin{pmatrix} u \\\\ v \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nOr, in the standard form $M\\mathbf{x}=0$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nK_s + K_w - m\\omega^2  -(K_s + K_w e^{-ika}) \\\\\n-(K_s + K_w e^{ika})  K_s + K_w - m\\omega^2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} u \\\\ v \\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nWe now evaluate this eigenproblem at the Brillouin zone boundary, $k = \\pi/a$. At this wave number, the phase factors become $\\exp(ika) = \\exp(i\\pi) = -1$ and $\\exp(-ika) = \\exp(-i\\pi) = -1$.\nThe matrix equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nK_s + K_w - m\\omega^2  -(K_s - K_w) \\\\\n-(K_s - K_w)  K_s + K_w - m\\omega^2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} u \\\\ v \\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution $(u, v)$, the determinant of the matrix must be zero. This gives the secular equation for the eigenfrequencies $\\omega$:\n$$\\det \\begin{pmatrix}\nK_s + K_w - m\\omega^2  -(K_s - K_w) \\\\\n-(K_s - K_w)  K_s + K_w - m\\omega^2\n\\end{pmatrix} = 0$$\n$$(K_s + K_w - m\\omega^2)^2 - (K_s - K_w)^2 = 0$$\n$$(K_s + K_w - m\\omega^2) = \\pm (K_s - K_w)$$\n\nThis yields two distinct solutions for the squared frequencies:\n1.  Lower frequency mode (acoustic branch at zone edge):\n    $K_s + K_w - m\\omega_1^2 = K_s - K_w \\implies m\\omega_1^2 = 2K_w \\implies \\omega_1^2 = \\frac{2K_w}{m}$\n2.  Higher frequency mode (optical branch at zone edge):\n    $K_s + K_w - m\\omega_2^2 = -(K_s - K_w) \\implies m\\omega_2^2 = 2K_s \\implies \\omega_2^2 = \\frac{2K_s}{m}$\n\nNow, we find the corresponding eigenvectors (polarization vectors) by substituting these frequencies back into the matrix equation.\n\nFor the lower frequency mode, $\\omega_1^2 = 2K_w/m$:\nThe first row of the matrix equation gives:\n$$(K_s + K_w - m\\omega_1^2)u - (K_s - K_w)v = 0$$\n$$(K_s + K_w - 2K_w)u - (K_s - K_w)v = 0$$\n$$(K_s - K_w)u - (K_s - K_w)v = 0$$\nAssuming $K_s \\neq K_w$, this implies $u=v$. The displacement amplitude ratio is $u/v = 1$. The normalized polarization vector is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFor the higher frequency mode, $\\omega_2^2 = 2K_s/m$:\nThe first row gives:\n$$(K_s + K_w - m\\omega_2^2)u - (K_s - K_w)v = 0$$\n$$(K_s + K_w - 2K_s)u - (K_s - K_w)v = 0$$\n$$(K_w - K_s)u - (K_s - K_w)v = 0$$\n$$-(K_s - K_w)u - (K_s - K_w)v = 0$$\nAssuming $K_s \\neq K_w$, this implies $-u=v$. The displacement amplitude ratio is $u/v = -1$. The normalized polarization vector is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFinally, we analyze the physical motion of these modes. At $k=\\pi/a$, adjacent unit cells move in antiphase ($u_{n+1} \\propto -u_n$, $v_{n+1} \\propto -v_n$).\n- For the mode with $u/v = 1$ (frequency $\\omega_1 = \\sqrt{2K_w/m}$), the atoms $A_n$ and $B_n$ within a unit cell move together ($u=v$). The relative displacement across the strong bond ($K_s$) inside the unit cell is $v_n - u_n$, which has an amplitude of $v-u=0$. The relative displacement across the weak bond ($K_w$) between cells $n$ and $n+1$ is $u_{n+1} - v_n$. The amplitude of this motion is $-u-v = -2u$. This mode, therefore, involves no stretching of the strong bonds; the motion consists of the rigid dimers $(A_nB_n)$ vibrating against each other, selectively stretching only the weak bonds. The frequency correctly depends only on $K_w$.\n\n- For the mode with $u/v = -1$ (frequency $\\omega_2 = \\sqrt{2K_s/m}$), the atoms $A_n$ and $B_n$ within a unit cell move in opposite directions ($u=-v$). The relative displacement across the strong bond ($K_s$) has an amplitude of $v-u = v - (-v) = 2v$. The relative displacement across the weak bond ($K_w$) has an amplitude of $-u-v = -(-v)-v=0$. This mode involves motion where the center of mass of each unit cell is stationary, and the atoms within the dimer vibrate against each other. It selectively stretches the strong bonds, and the frequency correctly depends only on $K_s$.\n\nThe two displacement amplitude ratios $u/v$ for the zone-boundary normal modes are $1$ and $-1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1  -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3000221"}]}
