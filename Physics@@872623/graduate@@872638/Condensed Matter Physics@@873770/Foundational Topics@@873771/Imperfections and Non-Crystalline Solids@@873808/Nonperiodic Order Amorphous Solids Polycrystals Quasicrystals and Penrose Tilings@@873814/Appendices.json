In 3D, each atom has $3$ translational degrees of freedom. For a network with average coordination number $\\bar{z}$:\n- Each bond contributes one bond-stretching constraint, but each bond is shared by two atoms. Therefore the number of bond-stretching constraints per atom is\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{BS}}=\\frac{\\bar{z}}{2}.\n$$\n- The angular constraints arise from fixing the orientations of the $\\bar{z}$ bonds around an atom. In 3D, each bond direction can be specified by $2$ angular parameters, so naïvely there are $2\\bar{z}$ angular parameters. However, an overall rigid-body rotation of the local coordination environment does not change the set of relative angles and removes $3$ degrees of freedom. Thus the number of independent bond-bending constraints per atom is\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{BB}}=2\\bar{z}-3.\n$$\nThis counting is a standard result for covalent networks with bond-stretching and bond-bending constraints.\n\nThe total number of constraints per atom is then\n$$\nn_{c}=n_{\\mathrm{BS}}+n_{\\mathrm{BB}}=\\frac{\\bar{z}}{2}+\\left(2\\bar{z}-3\\right)=\\frac{5}{2}\\bar{z}-3.\n$$\n\nThe isostatic condition is obtained by equating the number of constraints per atom to the number of degrees of freedom per atom, namely $3$ in 3D:\n$$\nn_{c}=3 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad \\frac{5}{2}\\bar{z}-3=3.\n$$\nSolving for $\\bar{z}$ gives the isostatic coordination threshold\n$$\n\\bar{z}_{c}=\\frac{12}{5}=2.4.\n$$\nThus:\n- If $\\bar{z}2.4$, then $n_{c}3$ and the network is floppy (underconstrained).\n- If $\\bar{z}=2.4$, then $n_{c}=3$ and the network is isostatic.\n- If $\\bar{z}2.4$, then $n_{c}3$ and the network is stressed-rigid (overconstrained).\n\nNext, we compute the average coordination number $\\bar{z}$ for the given glass composition.

The diffraction amplitude for $N$ scatterers at positions $\\{x_n\\}$ is $A_N(k) = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\exp(i k x_n)$.

Specifically, $\\exp(i k_0 x_n) = \\exp(-i k_{\\mathrm{int}} x_{\\mathrm{int},n})$, where $k_{\\mathrm{int}}$ is the internal-space component corresponding to $k_0$.\n\nThe amplitude at the Bragg peak is therefore a sum over the internal coordinates:\n$$A_{N}^{(\\mathrm{Fib})}(k_{0}) = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\exp(-i k_{\\mathrm{int}} x_{\\mathrm{int}, n})$$\nFor a large system, the $N$ internal coordinates $\\{x_{\\mathrm{int},n}\\}$ are uniformly distributed within the acceptance window $W$.
