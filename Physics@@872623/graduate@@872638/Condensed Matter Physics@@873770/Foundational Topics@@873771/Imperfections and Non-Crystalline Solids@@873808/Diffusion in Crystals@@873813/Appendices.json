For a semi-infinite medium ($x \\ge 0$), the initial condition is $C(x, 0) = M \\delta(x)$, where $M$ is the total amount of tracer deposited per unit area and $\\delta(x)$ is the Dirac delta function. The boundary condition at $x=0$ is that of a reflective wall (or rather, all flux is into the medium), as no material is lost from the surface.\n\nThe solution to the diffusion equation for these conditions is:\n$$\nC(x, t) = \\frac{M}{\\sqrt{\\pi D t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{4Dt}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that the measured concentration profile is well fit by a Gaussian function with variance $\\sigma^2$.

Now, we use this relationship to determine the activation energy $E_a$.\n\nWe have two experiments, for which we can write:\n1. At temperature $T_1$: $\\sigma_1^2 = 2D(T_1)t_1$\n2. At temperature $T_2$: $\\sigma_2^2 = 2D(T_2)t_2$\n\nFrom these, we can express the diffusion coefficients:\n$$\nD(T_1) = \\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{2t_1}\n$$\n$$\nD(T_2) = \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{2t_2}\n$$\nThe diffusion coefficient follows the Arrhenius equation: $D(T) = D_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right)$.

The analysis must begin from first principles.\n\nThe diffusion coefficient in a cubic crystal can be defined from the long-time behavior of the mean-squared displacement (MSD) of a random-walking particle. For a three-dimensional lattice, this relationship is given by:\n$$\nD_s = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\langle |\\mathbf{r}(t) - \\mathbf{r}(0)|^2 \\rangle}{6t}\n$$\nFor a random walk consisting of discrete jumps of length $\\lambda$ occurring at a total frequency $\\Gamma_s$, the MSD after a long time $t$ is $\\langle |\\mathbf{r}(t) - \\mathbf{r}(0)|^2 \\rangle = (\\Gamma_s t) \\lambda^2$. However, this expression assumes that the direction of each jump is independent of the previous one. In vacancy-mediated solute diffusion, the jump of a solute into an adjacent vacancy leaves the vacancy at the solute's original site, creating a high probability for a reverse jump. This introduces correlations between successive jump vectors. The effect of these correlations is captured by the correlation factor, $f_s$, which is less than $1$. The general expression for the diffusion coefficient is therefore:\n$$\nD_s = \\frac{1}{6} f_s \\Gamma_s \\lambda^2\n$$\nThe problem statement makes a crucial simplifying assumption: \"successive solute displacements are effectively uncorrelated\". This is a directive to set the correlation factor $f_s = 1$. Consequently, the parameters provided for bulk vacancy motion ($\\nu_v$ and $E_m^v$), which would be necessary to calculate $f_s$ in a more sophisticated model (e.g., the five-frequency model), are not required for this specific problem.\n\nThe remaining terms in the expression for $D_s$ must be determined.\nFirst, the jump distance, $\\lambda$, for a substitutional atom in an FCC lattice corresponds to the distance between nearest-neighbor sites. Given a lattice parameter $a$, the nearest-neighbor distance is $\\lambda = a/\\sqrt{2}$. Thus, the squared jump distance is:\n$$\n\\lambda^2 = \\frac{a^2}{2}\n$$\nNext, we derive the total jump frequency of the solute atom, $\\Gamma_s$. A solute atom can only jump if there is a vacancy on one of its $z$ nearest-neighbor sites. The total jump frequency is the sum of the jump rates into each of these $z$ sites. Let $\\omega_{sv}$ be the frequency of exchange between the solute and a vacancy located on an adjacent site. Let $c_v^{NN}$ be the probability that any given nearest-neighbor site of the solute is occupied by a vacancy. Assuming the dilute limit allows us to treat each of the $z$ neighboring sites independently and neglect cases with multiple adjacent vacancies. The total jump rate is then the product of the number of neighboring sites, the probability of a vacancy being on such a site, and the exchange frequency:\n$$\n\\Gamma_s = z \\, c_v^{NN} \\, \\omega_{sv}\n$$\nFor an FCC lattice, the coordination number is $z=12$.\n\nThe exchange frequency, $\\omega_{sv}$, is a thermally activated process governed by an Arrhenius-type relation. It is the product of an attempt frequency, $\\nu_{sv}$, and a Boltzmann factor containing the migration energy barrier, $E_m^{sv}$:\n$$\n\\omega_{sv} = \\nu_{sv} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_m^{sv}}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThe probability of finding a vacancy at a nearest-neighbor site to the solute, $c_v^{NN}$, is related to the equilibrium vacancy concentration in the bulk, $c_v^{bulk}$.

A positive binding energy signifies that the energy of the system is lower when the vacancy is adjacent to the solute.

The barrier $\\Delta E$ is purely electronic and is independent of isotope mass.\n\nThe dependence of the jump rate on mass comes from the pre-exponential factor, which contains the vibrational frequencies. For a harmonic mode $k$, its frequency $\\nu_k$ scales with the mass of the diffusing atom, $M$, according to its kinetic energy participation coefficient $c_k$. This scaling relation is given by:\n$$\n\\nu_k \\propto M^{-c_k/2}\n$$\nThus, for the two isotopes A and B, the ratio of frequencies for any given mode $k$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{(\\nu_k)_A}{(\\nu_k)_B} = \\left(\\frac{M_A}{M_B}\\right)^{-c_k/2} = \\left(\\frac{M_B}{M_A}\\right)^{c_k/2}\n$$\nNow, we can compute the ratio of the jump rates $\\Gamma_A/\\Gamma_B$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Gamma_A}{\\Gamma_B} = \\frac{\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{N} (\\nu_i^{\\text{basin}})_A\\right) / \\left(\\prod_{j=1}^{N-1} (\\nu_j^{\\text{saddle}})_A\\right)}{\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{N} (\\nu_i^{\\text{basin}})_B\\right) / \\left(\\prod_{j=1}^{N-1} (\\nu_j^{\\text{saddle}})_B\\right)} = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{(\\nu_i^{\\text{basin}})_A}{(\\nu_i^{\\text{basin}})_B}}{\\prod_{j=1}^{N-1} \\frac{(\\nu_j^{\\text{saddle}})_A}{(\\nu_j^{\\text{saddle}})_B}}\n$$\nSubstituting the mass-scaling relation for the frequencies:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Gamma_A}{\\Gamma_B} = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^{N} \\left(\\frac{M_B}{M_A}\\right)^{c_i^{\\text{basin}}/2}}{\\prod_{j=1}^{N-1} \\left(\\frac{M_B}{M_A}\\right)^{c_j^{\\text{saddle}}/2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_B}{M_A}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i^{\\text{basin}} - \\sum_{j=1}^{N-1} c_j^{\\text{saddle}} \\right)}\n$$\nThe problem provides the sum rules for the participation coefficients, which are based on the normalization of the kinetic energy of the diffusing atom in all three spatial directions:\n1.  Sum over all $N$ modes at the basin: $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i^{\\text{basin}} = 3$.\n2.  Sum over all $N$ modes at the saddle (including the one unstable mode): $\\sum_{k=1}^{N} c_k^{\\text{saddle}} = 3$.\n\nThe sum in the denominator of our exponent is over the $N-1$ stable modes at the saddle. We can write this sum as the total sum minus the contribution from the unstable mode:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{N-1} c_j^{\\text{saddle}} = \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{N} c_k^{\\text{saddle}}\\right) - c_{\\text{unstable}}^{\\text{saddle}}\n$$\nThe problem states that the kinetic energy participation of the tracer in the single unstable mode is $p$. So, $c_{\\text{unstable}}^{\\text{saddle}} = p$. This gives:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{N-1} c_j^{\\text{saddle}} = 3 - p\n$$\nSubstituting the sum rules back into the exponent for the jump rate ratio:\n$$\n\\text{Exponent} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 3 - (3 - p) \\right) = \\frac{p}{2}\n$$\nThis gives the final theoretical expression for the ratio of diffusion coefficients:\n$$\n\\frac{D_A^*}{D_B^*} = \\frac{\\Gamma_A}{\\Gamma_B} = \\left(\\frac{M_B}{M_A}\\right)^{p/2}\n$$\nThe mass-scaling exponent is $p/2$. We can now substitute the given numerical values:\n- $M_A = 28\\,\\mathrm{u}$\n- $M_B = 30\\,\\mathrm{u}$\n- $p = 4/5$\n\n$$\n\\frac{D_A^*}{D_B^*} = \\left(\\frac{30}{28}\\right)^{(4/5)/2} = \\left(\\frac{15}{14}\\right)^{2/5}\n$$\nThis is the final, exact, closed-form expression for the ratio.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{15}{14}\\right)^{\\frac{2}{5}}}\n$$", "id": "2982032"}]}
