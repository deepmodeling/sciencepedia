It is a standard problem in condensed matter physics concerning the Hall effect in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG).\n\nWe begin from the Lorentz force law for a charge carrier, which is given as $m\\,d\\mathbf{v}/dt = q\\left(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\right)$. In this system, the charge carriers are electrons, so their charge is $q = -e$, where $e$ is the positive elementary charge. The electric field vector is $\\mathbf{E} = E_x \\hat{x} + E_y \\hat{y}$, the magnetic field is $\\mathbf{B} = B \\hat{z}$, and the drift velocity of the electrons is $\\mathbf{v} = v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the cross product $\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B} = (v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y}) \\times (B \\hat{z}) = v_x B (\\hat{x} \\times \\hat{z}) + v_y B (\\hat{y} \\times \\hat{z})\n$$\nUsing the standard Cartesian basis vector relations $\\hat{x} \\times \\hat{z} = -\\hat{y}$ and $\\hat{y} \\times \\hat{z} = \\hat{x}$, we get:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B} = -v_x B \\hat{y} + v_y B \\hat{x}\n$$\nThe Lorentz force vector $\\mathbf{F} = q(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})$ can now be written in terms of its components:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F} = q\\left( (E_x \\hat{x} + E_y \\hat{y}) + (v_y B \\hat{x} - v_x B \\hat{y}) \\right) = q(E_x + v_y B)\\hat{x} + q(E_y - v_x B)\\hat{y}\n$$\nThe problem states that a steady state is reached in which a transverse field $E_y$ develops such that there is no net transverse drift. \"No net transverse drift\" implies that the $y$-component of the drift velocity is zero, i.e., $v_y = 0$. For a steady drift velocity to be maintained, the net force on the charge carriers must be zero. The condition of no net transverse drift specifically means the net force component in the $y$-direction, $F_y$, must be zero.\nSetting $F_y = 0$:\n$$\nF_y = q(E_y - v_x B) = 0\n$$\nSince the charge $q$ is non-zero, we must have:\n$$\nE_y - v_x B = 0 \\implies E_y = v_x B\n$$\nThis equation relates the induced transverse Hall electric field $E_y$ to the longitudinal drift velocity $v_x$ and the magnetic field $B$.\n\nNext, we use the provided definition for the two-dimensional current density (current per unit width), $j_x = n_s q v_x$. We can express the longitudinal drift velocity $v_x$ in terms of $j_x$:\n$$\nv_x = \\frac{j_x}{n_s q}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $v_x$ into the equation for $E_y$:\n$$\nE_y = \\left( \\frac{j_x}{n_s q} \\right) B\n$$\nThe problem defines the two-dimensional Hall coefficient $R_H^{2D}$ as:\n$$\nR_H^{2D} \\equiv \\frac{E_y}{j_x B}\n$$\nWe can now substitute our derived expression for $E_y$ into this definition:\n$$\nR_H^{2D} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{j_x}{n_s q} \\right) B}{j_x B} = \\frac{1}{n_s q}\n$$\nSince the charge carriers are electrons with charge $q = -e$, we obtain the final expression for the Hall coefficient in terms of the sheet density $n_s$ and the elementary charge $e$:\n$$\nR_H^{2D} = \\frac{1}{n_s (-e)} = -\\frac{1}{n_s e}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the charge carriers are negatively charged, which is consistent with an electron gas.\n\nNow, we connect this result to an experimental measurement in a Hall bar of width $w$. The total current $I$ flowing through the bar is related to the current per unit width $j_x$ by $I = j_x w$. The Hall voltage $V_H$ measured across the width $w$ is related to the uniform Hall field $E_y$ by $V_H = E_y w$.\n\nThe experimentally measured Hall resistance is defined as $R_{xy} \\equiv V_H/I$. We can express $R_{xy}$ using the relations above:\n$$\nR_{xy} = \\frac{V_H}{I} = \\frac{E_y w}{j_x w} = \\frac{E_y}{j_x}\n$$\nFrom the definition of the 2D Hall coefficient, $R_H^{2D} = \\frac{E_y}{j_x B}$, we can write $\\frac{E_y}{j_x} = R_H^{2D} B$.\nSubstituting this into our expression for $R_{xy}$:\n$$\nR_{xy} = R_H^{2D} B\n$$\nThis shows that the measured Hall resistance $R_{xy}$ is directly proportional to the magnetic field strength $B$. The problem asks for the relationship between the slope of $R_{xy}$ versus $B$ and $R_H^{2D}$. The slope is the derivative of $R_{xy}$ with respect to $B$. In this model, $n_s$ and $e$ are constants, so $R_H^{2D}$ is independent of $B$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{dR_{xy}}{dB} = \\frac{d}{dB}(R_H^{2D} B) = R_H^{2D}\n$$\nThus, the slope of a plot of the Hall resistance $R_{xy}$ versus the magnetic field $B$ is precisely the two-dimensional Hall coefficient $R_H^{2D}$. Measuring this slope provides a direct way to determine $n_s$, the carrier sheet density, as $n_s = -1/(e \\cdot (dR_{xy}/dB))$.\n\nThe problem asks for the closed-form expression for $R_H^{2D}$ as the final answer.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{n_s e}}\n$$", "id": "2993412"}, {"introduction": "Real materials are not perfect, and charge carriers constantly scatter off impurities and lattice vibrations.

For electrons, $q = -e$.\nKeeping only terms linear in fields on the right side, we get:\n$$ \\frac{g}{\\tau} \\approx -\\frac{q}{\\hbar}\\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} f_0 + \\frac{q}{\\hbar}(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} g $$\nUsing $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} f_0 = \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial \\epsilon} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} \\epsilon = \\hbar \\mathbf{v} \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial \\epsilon}$, the equation becomes:\n$$ g \\approx q\\tau (\\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial \\epsilon} + \\frac{q\\tau}{\\hbar} (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} g $$\nWe solve this for $g$ iteratively for a weak magnetic field. The zeroth-order solution (in $B$) is:\n$$ g_0(\\mathbf{k}) = q\\tau (\\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial \\epsilon} $$\nThe first-order correction in $B$ is found by substituting $g_0$ into the second term:\n$$ g_1(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{q\\tau}{\\hbar} (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} g_0 $$\nThe total current density is $\\mathbf{J} = 2q \\int \\frac{d^3\\mathbf{k}}{(2\\pi)^3} \\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{k}) f(\\mathbf{k})$. The part of the current linear in both $E$ and $B$ (the Hall current) comes from $g_1$:\n$$ J_{H,i} = 2q \\int \\frac{d^3\\mathbf{k}}{(2\\pi)^3} v_i g_1 = \\frac{2q^2\\tau}{\\hbar} \\int \\frac{d^3\\mathbf{k}}{(2\\pi)^3} v_i [(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} g_0] $$\nTo evaluate this integral, we use integration by parts in $\\mathbf{k}$-space. The surface terms at infinity vanish.\n$$ J_{H,i} = -\\frac{2q^2\\tau}{\\hbar} \\int \\frac{d^3\\mathbf{k}}{(2\\pi)^3} g_0 \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} \\cdot [v_i (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})] $$\nSubstituting the expression for $g_0$:\n$$ J_{H,i} = -\\frac{2q^3\\tau^2}{\\hbar} \\int \\frac{d^3\\mathbf{k}}{(2\\pi)^3} (\\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial\\epsilon} \\left( \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} \\cdot [v_i (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})] \\right) $$\nWe are interested in $\\sigma_{xy} = J_x/E_y$. Let $\\mathbf{E} = E_y \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, so $\\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = E_y v_y = E_y \\frac{\\hbar k_y}{m_y}$. We set $i=x$. The divergence term is:\n$$ \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} \\cdot [v_x (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})] = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} \\cdot \\left[\\frac{\\hbar k_x}{m_x} \\left( \\frac{\\hbar k_y B}{m_y}, -\\frac{\\hbar k_x B}{m_x}, 0 \\right)\\right] = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_x}\\left(\\frac{\\hbar^2 B k_x k_y}{m_x m_y}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_y}\\left(\\frac{\\hbar^2 B k_x^2}{m_x^2}\\right) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 B k_y}{m_x m_y} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $J_x$:\n$$ J_x = -\\frac{2q^3\\tau^2}{\\hbar} E_y \\int \\frac{d^3\\mathbf{k}}{(2\\pi)^3} \\left(\\frac{\\hbar k_y}{m_y}\\right) \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial\\epsilon} \\left(\\frac{\\hbar^2 B k_y}{m_x m_y}\\right) = -\\frac{2q^3\\tau^2 E_y B \\hbar^2}{m_x m_y^2} \\int \\frac{d^3\\mathbf{k}}{(2\\pi)^3} k_y^2 \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial\\epsilon} $$\nTo evaluate the integral, we use our transformed coordinates. Since $d^3\\mathbf{k} = d^3\\tilde{\\mathbf{k}}$ and $k_y = \\tilde{k}_y \\sqrt{m_y/m_d}$:\n$$ \\int \\frac{d^3\\mathbf{k}}{(2\\pi)^3} k_y^2 \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial\\epsilon} = \\frac{m_y}{m_d} \\int \\frac{d^3\\tilde{\\mathbf{k}}}{(2\\pi)^3} \\tilde{k}_y^2 \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial\\epsilon(\\tilde{k})} $$\nAt $T=0$, $\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial\\epsilon} = -\\delta(\\epsilon-\\epsilon_F)$. The integral becomes a surface integral over the Fermi sphere in $\\tilde{\\mathbf{k}}$-space.\n$$ \\int \\frac{d^3\\tilde{\\mathbf{k}}}{(2\\pi)^3} \\tilde{k}_y^2 \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial\\epsilon} = -\\int_{S_F} \\frac{d S_{\\tilde{k}}}{(2\\pi)^3 |\\nabla_{\\tilde{k}} \\epsilon|} \\tilde{k}_y^2 $$\nHere $|\\nabla_{\\tilde{k}} \\epsilon| = \\hbar^2\\tilde{k}_F/m_d$.
