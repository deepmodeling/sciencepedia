A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem asks for an estimation of the electronic mean free path, $\\ell$, based on the Drude model. In this model, electrons are treated as classical particles that move ballistically between instantaneous scattering events that randomize their momentum. The average distance an electron travels between these scattering events is defined as the mean free path.\n\nThe characteristic speed of the electrons contributing to transport in a degenerate Fermi sea is the Fermi velocity, $v_{F}$. The average time between scattering events is the mean free time, $\\tau$. Assuming the electrons travel at a constant speed $v_{F}$ during the time interval $\\tau$, the mean free path $\\ell$ is given by the fundamental relation:\n$$\n\\ell = v_{F} \\tau\n$$\nWe are given the values $v_{F} = 1.6 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$ and $\\tau = 2.0 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{s}$. Substituting these into the equation:\n$$\n\\ell = (1.6 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{s})\n$$\n$$\n\\ell = 3.2 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in nanometers (nm). Using the conversion factor $1\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$\n\\ell = (3.2 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\times \\left(\\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}}\\right) = 32\\,\\mathrm{nm}\n$$\nThis result is already expressed with $2$ significant figures, as inherited from the input values.\n\nNext, we must comment on whether the Ioffe–Regel criterion is respected. This criterion provides a lower bound on the mean free path for a material to exhibit metallic transport, where electrons can be described by extended, wave-like states (i.e., as well-defined quasiparticles). The criterion posits that for such a description to be valid, the mean free path $\\ell$ must be greater than the characteristic length scale of the crystal lattice, which is on the order of the interatomic spacing or lattice constant, $a$. The limit at which metallic transport breaks down is the Ioffe–Regel limit, $\\ell \\sim a$. If $\\ell  a$, electrons are considered to be strongly localized, and the Drude picture of ballistic motion is no longer applicable.\n\nTo check the criterion, we compare our calculated value of $\\ell$ with the given lattice spacing $a \\sim 3\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$. It is convenient to express both lengths in the same units. We convert $\\ell$ to angstroms ($\\mathrm{\\AA}$), where $1\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 10\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$:\n$$\n\\ell = 32\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 320\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}\n$$\nNow we compare $\\ell$ and $a$:\n$$\n\\ell = 320\\,\\mathrm{\\AA} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad a \\sim 3\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}\n$$\nThe ratio of the mean free path to the lattice spacing is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\ell}{a} \\approx \\frac{320\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}}{3\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}} \\approx 107\n$$\nSince $\\ell$ is more than two orders of magnitude larger than $a$ ($\\ell \\gg a$), the Ioffe–Regel criterion is respected, and strongly so. This confirms that the system is a good metal, where the Drude model's assumption of electrons as well-defined quasiparticles propagating ballistically between scattering events is a valid physical picture.\n\nThe final numerical answer required is the estimate of $\\ell$ in nanometers, which is $32$.

Consequently, the leading order term in the small parameter $\\omega_c \\tau$ is also zero.\n\nThe physical reason for this vanishing magnetoresistance is a key feature of the simple single-band isotropic Drude model. In a typical experimental setup for measuring longitudinal resistivity ($\\rho_{xx}$), a current $J_x$ is driven along the $x$-direction, and no current is allowed to flow in the transverse $y$-direction ($J_y=0$). The magnetic field $\\mathbf{B} = B\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ deflects the charge carriers in the $xy$-plane due to the Lorentz force. This deflection leads to an accumulation of charge on the sample boundaries, which creates a transverse electric field, the Hall field $E_y$. This Hall field grows until the electric force it exerts on the carriers exactly cancels the magnetic component of the Lorentz force in the transverse direction.\nIn this idealized model, all charge carriers are identical (same charge $q=-e$, mass $m$, and relaxation time $\\tau$). This homogeneity allows the Hall field to perfectly balance the Lorentz force for every single charge carrier simultaneously. The net force in the transverse direction becomes zero, so the carriers, on average, move only in the forward ($x$) direction, just as if there were no magnetic field. Since the magnetic field does not alter the forward motion of the charge carriers, it does not introduce any additional scattering or impediment to the flow of current. Therefore, the longitudinal resistivity $\\rho_{xx}$ remains unchanged and equal to its zero-field value $\\rho_0$. This perfect cancellation is an artifact of the model's simplicity. In real metals, factors like an anisotropic Fermi surface, multiple carrier types (electrons and holes), or an energy-dependent relaxation time break this perfect compensation, leading to a non-zero, typically positive, magnetoresistance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2983011"}]}
