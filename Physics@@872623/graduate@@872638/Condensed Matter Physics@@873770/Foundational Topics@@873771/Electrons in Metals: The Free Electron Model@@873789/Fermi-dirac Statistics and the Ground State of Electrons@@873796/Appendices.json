The derivation proceeds from first principles, beginning with the quantization of electron wavevectors imposed by periodic boundary conditions.\n\nWe consider a cube of side length $L$ and volume $V = L^{3}$. The periodic boundary conditions require that the electron wavefunction $\\psi(\\mathbf{r})$ satisfies $\\psi(x+L, y, z) = \\psi(x, y, z)$, and similarly for the $y$ and $z$ coordinates. For a plane wave solution of the form $\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) \\propto \\exp(i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r})$, this condition implies that $k_x L = 2\\pi n_x$, $k_y L = 2\\pi n_y$, and $k_z L = 2\\pi n_z$, where $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$ are integers. The allowed wavevectors are thus quantized:\n$$ \\mathbf{k} = \\frac{2\\pi}{L}(n_x, n_y, n_z) $$\nEach unique triplet of integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ defines a distinct quantum state. These allowed states form a discrete grid in wavevector space (k-space), with adjacent points separated by a distance of $2\\pi/L$ along each axis. The volume in k-space occupied by a single state is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta V_k = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^3 = \\frac{8\\pi^3}{L^3} = \\frac{8\\pi^3}{V} $$\nIn the limit of a large volume $V$, the discrete states become very dense, and we can treat the distribution of states as a continuum. The number of states $dN_k$ in an infinitesimal volume element $d^3k$ of k-space is given by the ratio of the volume element to the volume per state:\n$$ dN_k = \\frac{d^3k}{\\Delta V_k} = \\frac{V}{8\\pi^3} d^3k $$\nAccording to the Pauli exclusion principle, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state. Since electrons are spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ fermions, each $\\mathbf{k}$-state can accommodate two electrons: one with spin up and one with spin down. This introduces a spin degeneracy factor of $g_s = 2$.\n\nAt absolute zero temperature ($T=0$), the system is in its ground state. The electrons fill all the available single-particle energy levels starting from the lowest energy up to a maximum energy, the Fermi energy $\\varepsilon_F$. The single-particle energy is given by $\\varepsilon(\\mathbf{k}) = \\hbar^2 k^2/(2m)$, where $k = |\\mathbf{k}|$. Since the energy depends only on the magnitude of the wavevector, the occupied states in k-space form a sphere of radius $k_F$, known as the Fermi sphere. The Fermi wavevector $k_F$ is defined by $\\varepsilon_F = \\hbar^2 k_F^2/(2m)$.\n\nThe total number of electrons, $N$, can be calculated by integrating the number of available states within the Fermi sphere, multiplied by the spin degeneracy $g_s=2$:\n$$ N = g_s \\int_{k \\le k_F} \\frac{V}{8\\pi^3} d^3k = 2 \\frac{V}{8\\pi^3} \\int_{k \\le k_F} d^3k $$\nThe integral is simply the volume of the Fermi sphere, which is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3$.\n$$ N = 2 \\frac{V}{8\\pi^3} \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3\\right) = \\frac{8\\pi V k_F^3}{24\\pi^3} = \\frac{V k_F^3}{3\\pi^2} $$\nThe number density of electrons is $n = N/V$.

The integral becomes:\n$$ E_0 = \\frac{V\\hbar^2}{8\\pi^3 m} \\int_0^{k_F} k^2 (4\\pi k^2 dk) = \\frac{4\\pi V\\hbar^2}{8\\pi^3 m} \\int_0^{k_F} k^4 dk = \\frac{V\\hbar^2}{2\\pi^2 m} \\int_0^{k_F} k^4 dk $$\nThe integral of $k^4$ is $\\frac{k^5}{5}$:\n$$ E_0 = \\frac{V\\hbar^2}{2\\pi^2 m} \\left[\\frac{k^5}{5}\\right]_0^{k_F} = \\frac{V\\hbar^2 k_F^5}{10\\pi^2 m} $$\nThe problem asks for the ground-state energy per particle, $E_0/N$.

We substitute the expression for $k_F = (3\\pi^2 n)^{1/3}$:\n$$ k_F^2 = ((3\\pi^2 n)^{1/3})^2 = (3\\pi^2 n)^{2/3} = (3\\pi^2)^{2/3} n^{2/3} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $E_0/N$:\n$$ \\frac{E_0}{N} = \\frac{3\\hbar^2}{10m} (3\\pi^2)^{2/3} n^{2/3} $$\nThis is the final expression for the ground-state energy per particle.

Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC)**\nThe boundary condition is $\\psi(x+L) = \\psi(x)$. Applying this to the plane wave solution $\\psi_k(x) = C e^{ikx}$ gives:\n$$C e^{ik(x+L)} = C e^{ikx} \\implies e^{ikL} = 1$$\nThis quantizes the wavevector $k$.

Including the spin degeneracy of $g_s=2$, the number of states in an interval $dk$ is $dN = g_s \\frac{dk}{\\Delta k} = 2 \\frac{dk}{2\\pi/L} = \\frac{L}{\\pi} dk$. Thus, the DOS in $k$-space is:\n$$g_{k}^{(\\mathrm{P})}(k) = \\frac{L}{\\pi}$$\nTo find the DOS in energy, $g_{\\varepsilon}(\\varepsilon)$, we use the relation $g_{\\varepsilon}(\\varepsilon) = g_k(k) \\left| \\frac{dk}{d\\varepsilon} \\right|$. Since $\\varepsilon(k) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}$, for a given $\\varepsilon  0$, there are two states, one at $k = \\frac{\\sqrt{2m\\varepsilon}}{\\hbar}$ and one at $k = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2m\\varepsilon}}{\\hbar}$. We can consider the density on the positive $k$-axis and multiply by $2$. The number of states in $dk$ for $k0$ is $g_s \\frac{dk}{2\\pi/L}$ per direction.

Since $n=0$ gives a trivial wavefunction and $n0$ gives a state linearly dependent on the corresponding positive $n$ state, we take only positive integers.\nThe allowed wavevectors under HWBC are:\n$$k_n^{(\\mathrm{H})} = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}, \\quad n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$$\nThese states are equally spaced on the positive $k$-axis with separation $\\Delta k = \\frac{\\pi}{L}$.\nIncluding spin degeneracy $g_s=2$, the DOS in $k$-space for $k  0$ is $g_{k}^{(\\mathrm{H})}(k) = g_s \\frac{1}{\\Delta k} = 2 \\frac{L}{\\pi}$.\nFor the DOS in energy, we relate $k$ and $\\varepsilon$ for $k0$: $k = \\frac{\\sqrt{2m\\varepsilon}}{\\hbar}$.

For PBC, states are at multiples of $\\frac{2\\pi}{L}$ and include $k=0$ and negative values. For HWBC, states are at positive multiples of $\\frac{\\pi}{L}$. The spacing between levels for HWBC is half that for PBC. However, in the thermodynamic limit ($L \\to \\infty$), the discrete spacing becomes negligible. The coarse-grained DOS in energy, $g_{\\varepsilon}(\\varepsilon)$, is identical for both cases:\n$$g_{\\varepsilon}(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{L}{\\pi\\hbar}\\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\varepsilon}}$$\nThis reflects the principle that for large systems, bulk properties are independent of boundary conditions.\n\n### Part 2: Fermi Wavevector and Energy\n\nAt zero temperature ($T=0$), the $N$ electrons fill the lowest available single-particle energy levels, with two electrons (spin-up and spin-down) occupying each spatial orbital, according to the Pauli exclusion principle.

These levels are non-degenerate.\nWe fill the lowest $N/2$ orbitals, which simply corresponds to filling the levels from $n=1$ up to $n=N/2$.\nThe highest occupied level corresponds to the quantum number $n_{\\mathrm{max}} = N/2$.\nThe Fermi wavevector is the wavevector for this highest level:\n$$k_{F}^{(\\mathrm{H})} = k_{N/2}^{(\\mathrm{H})} = \\frac{(N/2)\\pi}{L} = \\frac{\\pi N}{2L}$$\nThe Fermi energy is the energy of this highest occupied level:\n$$E_{F}^{(\\mathrm{H})} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 (k_{F}^{(\\mathrm{H})})^2}{2m} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\left( \\frac{\\pi N}{2L} \\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi^2\\hbar^2 N^2}{8mL^2}$$\n\n### Part 3: Finite-Size Difference in Fermi Energy\n\nWe now compute the difference $\\Delta E_F = E_{F}^{(\\mathrm{HW})} - E_{F}^{(\\mathrm{P})}$ using the exact expressions derived above.\n$$E_{F}^{(\\mathrm{H})} = \\frac{\\pi^2\\hbar^2}{8mL^2} N^2$$\n$$E_{F}^{(\\mathrm{P})} = \\frac{\\pi^2\\hbar^2}{8mL^2} (N-2)^2$$\nThe difference is:\n$$\\Delta E_F = \\frac{\\pi^2\\hbar^2}{8mL^2} \\left[ N^2 - (N-2)^2 \\right]$$\nWe expand the term in the brackets:\n$$N^2 - (N-2)^2 = N^2 - (N^2 - 4N + 4) = 4N - 4 = 4(N-1)$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\Delta E_F$:\n$$\\Delta E_F = \\frac{\\pi^2\\hbar^2}{8mL^2} [4(N-1)] = \\frac{4\\pi^2\\hbar^2(N-1)}{8mL^2}$$\nSimplifying the expression gives the final result:\n$$\\Delta E_F = \\frac{\\pi^2\\hbar^2(N-1)}{2mL^2}$$\nThis expression represents the finite-size correction to the Fermi energy due to the difference in boundary conditions.
