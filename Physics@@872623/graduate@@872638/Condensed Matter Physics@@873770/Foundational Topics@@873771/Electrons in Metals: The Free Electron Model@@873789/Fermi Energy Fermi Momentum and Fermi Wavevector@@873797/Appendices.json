The derivation proceeds in two main stages: first, approximating the energy dispersion near the band minimum, and second, relating the filling to the size of the Fermi sea in $k$-space.\n\nThe energy dispersion for non-interacting electrons on a square lattice with lattice constant $a$ and nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude $t$ is given by:\n$$\nE(\\mathbf{k}) = -2t\\left[\\cos(k_x a) + \\cos(k_y a)\\right]\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{k} = (k_x, k_y)$ is the wavevector.

This is the equation of a circle in the $(k_x, k_y)$ plane centered at the origin. Thus, the constant-energy contours at low energy are circular, confirming the assumption of rotational invariance.\n\nNext, we relate the filling $n$ to the Fermi wavevector $k_F$. At $T=0$, electrons fill all states up to the Fermi energy $E_F$. The set of occupied states forms a Fermi sea. Due to the circular nature of the constant-energy contours, the Fermi surface is a circle of radius $k_F$, centered at the $\\Gamma$ point. The area of the Fermi sea in $k$-space is $A_k = \\pi k_F^2$.\n\nTo count the number of electronic states, we use Born-von Karman boundary conditions for a finite system of real-space area $A_{real} = L \\times L$.
