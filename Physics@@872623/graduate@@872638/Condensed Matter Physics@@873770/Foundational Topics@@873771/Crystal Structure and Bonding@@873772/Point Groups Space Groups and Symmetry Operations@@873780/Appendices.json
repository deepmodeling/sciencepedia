The entire analysis will be based on the provided definitions and first principles.\n\nLet a point in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ be represented by a column vector of its coordinates $(x, y, z)$ in the given right-handed Cartesian basis $\\{ \\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}} \\}$. A symmetry operation is a linear transformation on this vector, represented by a $3 \\times 3$ matrix.\n\n**Task 1: Matrix Representation of Group Elements**\n\nWe determine the matrix for each symmetry operation by observing its effect on the coordinates $(x, y, z)$.\n\n- **Identity ($E$)**: The identity operation leaves every point unchanged.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\\\ z' \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1x + 0y + 0z \\\\ 0x + 1y + 0z \\\\ 0x + 0y + 1z \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThus, the matrix representing the identity element $E$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix:\n$$\nE = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n- **2-fold Rotation ($C_2$)**: This is a rotation by $\\pi$ radians ($180^\\circ$) about the $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}$-axis.

All are orthogonal, as required for symmetry operations.\n\n**Task 2: Group Multiplication Table**\n\nGroup multiplication is defined as matrix composition. We compute the $16$ products of the form $g_i g_j$, where $g_i$ corresponds to the row element and $g_j$ to the column element.\n\nLet's compute a few examples:\n- $C_2 \\sigma_v(xz) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\sigma_v'(yz)$\n- $\\sigma_v(xz) C_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\sigma_v'(yz)$\n- $\\sigma_v(xz) \\sigma_v'(yz) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = C_2$\n\nAlso, note that each non-identity element is its own inverse, as squaring each matrix yields the identity matrix:\n$C_2^2 = E$, $(\\sigma_v(xz))^2 = E$, $(\\sigma_v'(yz))^2 = E$. This implies $g = g^{-1}$ for all $g \\in \\{C_2, \\sigma_v(xz), \\sigma_v'(yz)\\}$.\n\nBy performing all $16$ matrix multiplications, we construct the following group multiplication table (Cayley table) for $C_{2v}$:\n\n| $g_i \\backslash g_j$ | $E$                | $C_2$              | $\\sigma_v(xz)$     | $\\sigma_v'(yz)$    |\n|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| $E$                  | $E$                | $C_2$              | $\\sigma_v(xz)$     | $\\sigma_v'(yz)$    |\n| $C_2$                | $C_2$              | $E$                | $\\sigma_v'(yz)$    | $\\sigma_v(xz)$     |\n| $\\sigma_v(xz)$       | $\\sigma_v(xz)$     | $\\sigma_v'(yz)$    | $E$                | $C_2$              |\n| $\\sigma_v'(yz)$      | $\\sigma_v'(yz)$    | $\\sigma_v(xz)$     | $C_2$              | $E$                |\n\nThe table is symmetric about its main diagonal (i.e., $g_i g_j = g_j g_i$ for all $g_i, g_j$ in the group). This property proves that the group $C_{2v}$ is Abelian.\n\n**Task 3: Conjugacy Classes**\n\nTwo elements $a$ and $b$ of a group $G$ are said to be conjugate if there exists an element $g \\in G$ such that $b = g a g^{-1}$. The set of all elements conjugate to $a$ forms its conjugacy class.\n\nAs established from the multiplication table, the group $C_{2v}$ is Abelian. For any two elements $a, g$ in an Abelian group, their product commutes: $g a = a g$. Using this property, we can simplify the expression for a conjugate element:\n$$\nb = g a g^{-1} = (g a) g^{-1} = (a g) g^{-1} = a (g g^{-1}) = a E = a\n$$\nThis shows that for any element $a$ in an Abelian group, the only element conjugate to $a$ is $a$ itself. Consequently, each element of the group forms its own conjugacy class, containing only that single element.\n\nApplying this to $C_{2v}$, we find the following distinct conjugacy classes:\n1. The class of $E$: $\\{g E g^{-1} | g \\in C_{2v}\\} = \\{E\\}$\n2. The class of $C_2$: $\\{g C_2 g^{-1} | g \\in C_{2v}\\} = \\{C_2\\}$\n3. The class of $\\sigma_v(xz)$: $\\{g \\sigma_v(xz) g^{-1} | g \\in C_{2v}\\} = \\{\\sigma_v(xz)\\}$\n4. The class of $\\sigma_v'(yz)$: $\\{g \\sigma_v'(yz) g^{-1} | g \\in C_{2v}\\} = \\{\\sigma_v'(yz)\\}$\n\nThus, there are four conjugacy classes in the point group $C_{2v}$.\n\n**Task 4: Number of Conjugacy Classes**\n\nBased on the analysis in Task 3, we count the number of distinct conjugacy classes. The classes are $\\{E\\}$, $\\{C_2\\}$, $\\{\\sigma_v(xz)\\}$, and $\\{\\sigma_v'(yz)\\}$.\nThe total number of conjugacy classes, denoted by $N$, is $4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "3010483"}, {"introduction": "Crystals are defined by periodic translational symmetry, which, when combined with rotations and reflections, gives rise to space groups.

A rotation by $\\pi$ radians ($180^\\circ$), which is a $C_2$ rotation, about the $z$-axis.\n2. A translation by half a lattice vector along the axis of rotation, which is $\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{c}$.\n\nWe need to find the Seitz operator $\\{W \\mid \\mathbf{w}\\}$ that represents this combined operation in the basis of fractional coordinates.\n\n**1. Determine the rotational part, $W$**\nThe rotational part, $W$, is the matrix representation of the $C_2$ rotation about the $z$-axis. This rotation transforms a point with coordinates $(x,y,z)$ to $(-x,-y,z)$. The matrix $W$ that performs this transformation on the column vector $\\mathbf{r} = (x,y,z)^{\\mathsf{T}}$ is:\n$$ W = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n**2. Determine the translational part, $\\mathbf{w}$**\nThe translational part, $\\mathbf{w}$, corresponds to the non-primitive translation associated with the screw axis. The translation is given as $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the lattice vector $\\mathbf{c}$ along the $z$-axis. In the system of fractional coordinates, a translation by $n_a\\mathbf{a} + n_b\\mathbf{b} + n_c\\mathbf{c}$ is represented by the vector $(n_a, n_b, n_c)^{\\mathsf{T}}$. Therefore, a translation of $\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{c}$ is represented by the fractional translation vector:\n$$ \\mathbf{w} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nCombining these, the Seitz operator for the $2_1$ screw axis along the $z$-direction is $\\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\middle| \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\}$.\n\n**3. Compute the action on a general point $(x,y,z)$**\nThe action of the Seitz operator on a point with fractional coordinates $\\mathbf{r} = (x,y,z)^{\\mathsf{T}}$ is given by the formula $\\mathbf{r}' = W\\mathbf{r} + \\mathbf{w}$. Let $\\mathbf{r}' = (x',y',z')^{\\mathsf{T}}$.\nSubstituting the derived $W$ and $\\mathbf{w}$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\\\ z' \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nPerforming the matrix-vector multiplication:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\\\ z' \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -x \\\\ -y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nPerforming the vector addition:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\\\ z' \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -x \\\\ -y \\\\ z + \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThus, the transformed coordinates are $(x', y', z') = (-x, -y, z + \\frac{1}{2})$.\n\n**4. Explain the absence of a fixed point**\nA fixed point of an operation is a point $\\mathbf{r}$ that remains unchanged by the operation. For a Seitz operator, this means $\\mathbf{r}' = \\mathbf{r}$. The problem specifies that we are looking for a fixed point in Euclidean space, meaning a strict equality $\\mathbf{r}' = \\mathbf{r}$, not an equality modulo a lattice translation.\nSetting $\\mathbf{r}' = \\mathbf{r}$, we have $(x',y',z')^{\\mathsf{T}} = (x,y,z)^{\\mathsf{T}}$. Using the result from the previous step:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -x \\\\ -y \\\\ z + \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis vector equality gives a system of three linear equations:\n1. $x = -x$\n2. $y = -y$\n3. $z = z + \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nFrom the first equation, $2x=0$, which implies $x=0$.\nFrom the second equation, $2y=0$, which implies $y=0$.\nFrom the third equation, subtracting $z$ from both sides yields $0 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThis last equation, $0 = \\frac{1}{2}$, is a mathematical contradiction. Since the system of equations derived from the fixed-point condition leads to a contradiction, no solution $(x,y,z)$ exists. Consequently, the $2_1$ screw operation has no fixed points.

It is specified to have $3$ conjugacy classes: $K_1 = \\{E\\}$, $K_2 = \\{C_3, C_3^2\\}$, and $K_3 = \\{\\sigma_{v1}, \\sigma_{v2}, \\sigma_{v3}\\}$. The number of elements in these classes are $n_1=1$, $n_2=2$, and $n_3=3$, respectively.\n\nAccording to a fundamental theorem of group representation theory, the number of irreducible representations (irreps) is equal to the number of conjugacy classes. Therefore, $C_{3v}$ has $3$ irreps. Let us denote the dimensions of these irreps by $d_\\alpha$, where $\\alpha=1, 2, 3$. The dimensions must satisfy the dimension sum rule:\n$$ \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{3} d_{\\alpha}^{2} = h = 6 $$\nThe only integer solution for this equation is $d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 = 6$. Thus, $C_{3v}$ possesses two $1$-dimensional irreps and one $2$-dimensional irrep. By convention (Mulliken notation), the $1$D irreps are denoted $A_1$ and $A_2$, and the $2$D irrep is denoted $E$.\n\nThe character of an operation $g$ in a representation $\\Gamma_\\alpha$, denoted $\\chi^\\alpha(g)$, is the trace of the corresponding representation matrix $D^\\alpha(g)$. The character of the identity element $E$ is always the dimension of the representation, so $\\chi^\\alpha(E) = d_\\alpha$. This gives us the first column of the character table: $\\chi^{A_1}(E)=1$, $\\chi^{A_2}(E)=1$, and $\\chi^{E}(E)=2$.\n\nEvery group has a totally symmetric (or trivial) irrep, where every group element is mapped to the number $1$. This is conventionally labeled $A_1$. The characters for this irrep are:\n$$ \\chi^{A_1}(E) = 1, \\quad \\chi^{A_1}(2C_3) = 1, \\quad \\chi^{A_1}(3\\sigma_v) = 1 $$\n\nThe characters of the irreps must satisfy the great orthogonality theorem, which for characters simplifies to two relations. The orthogonality of rows is given by:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{3} n_i \\chi^\\alpha(K_i) [\\chi^\\beta(K_i)]^* = h \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta} $$\nwhere $n_i$ is the number of elements in class $K_i$.\n\nLet's find the characters for the $A_2$ irrep, which is $1$D. Let its characters be $\\chi^{A_2} = (1, a, b)$. Applying the orthogonality relation with $A_1$ (for $\\alpha=A_1, \\beta=A_2$):\n$$ n_1 \\chi^{A_1}(E) \\chi^{A_2}(E) + n_2 \\chi^{A_1}(2C_3) \\chi^{A_2}(2C_3) + n_3 \\chi^{A_1}(3\\sigma_v) \\chi^{A_2}(3\\sigma_v) = 0 $$\n$$ (1)(1)(1) + (2)(1)(a) + (3)(1)(b) = 0 \\implies 1 + 2a + 3b = 0 $$\nFor a $1$D representation, the character is the matrix element itself. Since $(C_3)^3=E$ and $(\\sigma_v)^2=E$, the characters must satisfy $(\\chi(C_3))^3=1$ and $(\\chi(\\sigma_v))^2=1$. Also, since $C_3^{-1}=C_3^2$ is in the same class as $C_3$, the character $\\chi(C_3)$ must be real (as $\\chi(g^{-1})=\\chi(g)^*$). Thus, $\\chi(C_3)=1$, which makes $a=1$. For $\\sigma_v$, $\\chi(\\sigma_v)=\\pm 1$, so $b=\\pm 1$. Substituting $a=1$ into our equation: $1+2(1)+3b=0 \\implies 3+3b=0 \\implies b=-1$.\nThe characters for $A_2$ are therefore:\n$$ \\chi^{A_2}(E) = 1, \\quad \\chi^{A_2}(2C_3) = 1, \\quad \\chi^{A_2}(3\\sigma_v) = -1 $$\n\nTo find the characters for the $E$ irrep, let them be $\\chi^{E} = (2, c, d)$. We use orthogonality with $A_1$ and $A_2$.\nWith $A_1$: $(1)(1)(2) + (2)(1)(c) + (3)(1)(d) = 0 \\implies 2 + 2c + 3d = 0$.\nWith $A_2$: $(1)(1)(2) + (2)(1)(c) + (3)(-1)(d) = 0 \\implies 2 + 2c - 3d = 0$.\nAdding these two equations gives $4 + 4c = 0 \\implies c = -1$.\nSubstituting $c=-1$ into the first equation: $2 + 2(-1) + 3d = 0 \\implies 3d = 0 \\implies d = 0$.\nThe characters for the $E$ irrep are:\n$$ \\chi^{E}(E) = 2, \\quad \\chi^{E}(2C_3) = -1, \\quad \\chi^{E}(3\\sigma_v) = 0 $$\n\nThe complete character table for $C_{3v}$ is:\n| $C_{3v}$ | $E$ | $2C_3$ | $3\\sigma_v$ |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| $A_1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ |\n| $A_2$ | $1$ | $1$ | $-1$ |\n| $E$ | $2$ | $-1$ | $0$ |\n\n**Part 2: Decomposition of the Vector Representation**\n\nThe three-dimensional vector space spanned by the Cartesian coordinates $\\{x, y, z\\}$ forms a representation $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{vec}}$. We find its characters by determining the trace of the transformation matrices for a representative operation from each class. Let the $z$-axis be the principal axis of rotation ($C_3$) and let one of the $\\sigma_v$ planes be the $xz$-plane.\n- **Identity $E$**: The transformation is $(x,y,z) \\to (x,y,z)$. The matrix is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix. $\\chi^{\\mathrm{vec}}(E) = \\mathrm{Tr}(I_3) = 3$.\n- **Rotation $C_3$**: Rotation by $2\\pi/3$ about the $z$-axis. The transformation matrix is $D(C_3) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(2\\pi/3) & -\\sin(2\\pi/3) & 0 \\\\ \\sin(2\\pi/3) & \\cos(2\\pi/3) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe character is $\\chi^{\\mathrm{vec}}(C_3) = \\cos(2\\pi/3)+\\cos(2\\pi/3)+1 = -1/2-1/2+1=0$.\n- **Reflection $\\sigma_v$**: Reflection through the $xz$-plane. The transformation is $(x,y,z) \\to (x,-y,z)$. The matrix is $D(\\sigma_v) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe character is $\\chi^{\\mathrm{vec}}(\\sigma_v) = 1-1+1=1$.\n\nThe character set for $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{vec}}$ is $\\chi^{\\mathrm{vec}} = (3, 0, 1)$.\nTo decompose this representation, $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{vec}} = a_{A_1} A_1 \\oplus a_{A_2} A_2 \\oplus a_{E} E$, we find the multiplicities $a_{\\alpha}$ using the reduction formula:\n$$ a_\\alpha = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{i} n_i \\chi^{\\mathrm{vec}}(K_i) [\\chi^{\\alpha}(K_i)]^* $$\n- $a_{A_1} = \\frac{1}{6} [(1)(3)(1) + (2)(0)(1) + (3)(1)(1)] = \\frac{1}{6}(3+0+3) = 1$.\n- $a_{A_2} = \\frac{1}{6} [(1)(3)(1) + (2)(0)(1) + (3)(1)(-1)] = \\frac{1}{6}(3+0-3) = 0$.\n- $a_{E} = \\frac{1}{6} [(1)(3)(2) + (2)(0)(-1) + (3)(1)(0)] = \\frac{1}{6}(6+0+0) = 1$.\n\nSo, $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{vec}} = A_1 \\oplus E$. The multiplicities are $(a_{A_1}^{\\mathrm{vec}},a_{A_2}^{\\mathrm{vec}},a_{E}^{\\mathrm{vec}}) = (1, 0, 1)$.\nThe basis function $z$ is invariant under all operations of $C_{3v}$ (it defines the principal axis), so it transforms as the totally symmetric representation $A_1$. The remaining basis functions $\\{x,y\\}$ must form a basis for the $2$-dimensional representation $E$.\n\n**Part 3: Decomposition of the Symmetric Quadratic Representation**\n\nThe six-dimensional space of symmetric quadratic forms is spanned by $\\{x^2, y^2, z^2, xy, xz, yz\\}$. The corresponding representation $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{quad}}$ is the symmetric direct product of the vector representation with itself, $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{quad}} = [\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{vec}} \\otimes \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{vec}}]_{\\mathrm{symm}}$.\nThe character for this representation is given by the formula:\n$$ \\chi^{\\mathrm{quad}}(g) = \\frac{1}{2} [(\\chi^{\\mathrm{vec}}(g))^2 + \\chi^{\\mathrm{vec}}(g^2)] $$\nWe have $\\chi^{\\mathrm{vec}} = (3, 0, 1)$. We need to determine $g^2$ for the class representatives:\n- For $g=E$, $g^2=E$, so $\\chi^{\\mathrm{vec}}(E^2) = \\chi^{\\mathrm{vec}}(E) = 3$.\n- For $g=C_3$, $g^2=C_3^2$. Since $C_3^2$ is in the same class as $C_3$, $\\chi^{\\mathrm{vec}}(C_3^2)=\\chi^{\\mathrm{vec}}(C_3)=0$.\n- For $g=\\sigma_v$, $g^2=E$, so $\\chi^{\\mathrm{vec}}(\\sigma_v^2) = \\chi^{\\mathrm{vec}}(E) = 3$.\n\nNow we calculate the characters for $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{quad}}$:\n- $\\chi^{\\mathrm{quad}}(E) = \\frac{1}{2} [(\\chi^{\\mathrm{vec}}(E))^2 + \\chi^{\\mathrm{vec}}(E^2)] = \\frac{1}{2}(3^2 + 3) = 6$.\n- $\\chi^{\\mathrm{quad}}(C_3) = \\frac{1}{2} [(\\chi^{\\mathrm{vec}}(C_3))^2 + \\chi^{\\mathrm{vec}}(C_3^2)] = \\frac{1}{2}(0^2 + 0) = 0$.\n- $\\chi^{\\mathrm{quad}}(\\sigma_v) = \\frac{1}{2} [(\\chi^{\\mathrm{vec}}(\\sigma_v))^2 + \\chi^{\\mathrm{vec}}(\\sigma_v^2)] = \\frac{1}{2}(1^2 + 3) = 2$.\n\nThe character set for $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{quad}}$ is $\\chi^{\\mathrm{quad}} = (6, 0, 2)$.\nWe decompose this representation to find the multiplicities $a_{\\alpha}^{\\mathrm{quad}}$:\n- $a_{A_1} = \\frac{1}{6} [(1)(6)(1) + (2)(0)(1) + (3)(2)(1)] = \\frac{1}{6}(6+0+6) = 2$.\n- $a_{A_2} = \\frac{1}{6} [(1)(6)(1) + (2)(0)(1) + (3)(2)(-1)] = \\frac{1}{6}(6+0-6) = 0$.\n- $a_{E} = \\frac{1}{6} [(1)(6)(2) + (2)(0)(-1) + (3)(2)(0)] = \\frac{1}{6}(12+0+0) = 2$.\n\nSo, $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{quad}} = 2A_1 \\oplus 2E$. The multiplicities are $(a_{A_1}^{\\mathrm{quad}},a_{A_2}^{\\mathrm{quad}},a_{E}^{\\mathrm{quad}}) = (2, 0, 2)$.\nThe basis functions for these irreps can be identified. The two functions transforming as $A_1$ are combinations of the basis that are invariant under all group operations; these are $z^2$ and $x^2+y^2$. The two pairs of functions transforming as $E$ are $\\{xz, yz\\}$ and $\\{x^2-y^2, xy\\}$. This confirms the $2A_1 \\oplus 2E$ structure.\n\nThe final answer requires a concatenation of the character table entries and the derived multiplicities.\n- Characters for $A_1$: $(1, 1, 1)$\n- Characters for $A_2$: $(1, 1, -1)$\n- Characters for $E$: $(2, -1, 0)$\n- Vector multiplicities $(a_{A_1}^{\\mathrm{vec}},a_{A_2}^{\\mathrm{vec}},a_{E}^{\\mathrm{vec}})$: $(1, 0, 1)$\n- Quadratic multiplicities $(a_{A_1}^{\\mathrm{quad}},a_{A_2}^{\\mathrm{quad}},a_{E}^{\\mathrm{quad}})$: $(2, 0, 2)$\nThe concatenated row matrix is $(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 2, -1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 2)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & -1 & 2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3010453"}]}
