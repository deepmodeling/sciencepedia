Let $x \\equiv \\dfrac{E-E_C}{k_B T}$. This implies $E = E_C + x k_B T$ and $dE = k_B T dx$. The integration limits for $x$ are from $0$ to $\\infty$. The argument of the exponential in the FD function becomes:\n$$\n\\dfrac{E-\\mu}{k_B T} = \\dfrac{(E-E_C) - (\\mu - E_C)}{k_B T} = x - \\eta\n$$\nwhere $\\eta \\equiv \\dfrac{\\mu-E_C}{k_B T}$ is the reduced chemical potential.

The MB approximation is valid when the exponential term in the denominator is much greater than $1$:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(\\dfrac{E-\\mu}{k_B T}\\right) \\gg 1\n$$\nUnder this condition, $f_{\\mathrm{FD}}(E) \\approx \\dfrac{1}{\\exp((E-\\mu)/k_B T)} = \\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{E-\\mu}{k_B T}\\right) \\equiv f_{\\mathrm{MB}}(E)$.\nFor this approximation to be valid for the calculation of the carrier concentration $n(T)$, the condition must hold for all energies $E$ that contribute significantly to the integral. The integration range is $E \\ge E_C$. The term $\\exp((E-\\mu)/k_B T)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $E$. Therefore, the condition is at its most stringent (i.e., the exponential term is at its smallest) at the lowest energy in the integration range, which is $E = E_C$.\nThus, the precise condition for the MB approximation to be valid is:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(\\dfrac{E_C-\\mu}{k_B T}\\right) \\gg 1\n$$\nUsing the definition of the reduced chemical potential, $\\eta = (\\mu-E_C)/(k_B T)$, this condition becomes:\n$$\n\\exp(-\\eta) \\gg 1\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides, we find $-\\eta \\gg 0$, or $\\eta \\ll 0$. This means the chemical potential $\\mu$ must be located several $k_B T$ below the conduction band edge $E_C$. This is the definition of a non-degenerate semiconductor.\n\nPart 3: Relative error $\\varepsilon(\\eta)$\n\nFirst, we derive the electron concentration under the Maxwell-Boltzmann approximation, $n_{\\mathrm{MB}}(T)$.

It represents a standard calculation in semiconductor physics and can be solved using fundamental principles. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe starting point for analyzing carrier concentrations in a semiconductor is the principle of charge neutrality. For a semiconductor doped with donors (concentration $N_D$) and acceptors (concentration $N_A$), the equation is:\n$$p + N_{D}^{+} = n + N_{A}^{-}$$\nwhere $n$ is the free-electron concentration, $p$ is the hole concentration, $N_{D}^{+}$ is the concentration of ionized donors, and $N_{A}^{-}$ is the concentration of ionized acceptors.\n\nThe problem specifies an uncompensated $n$-type silicon crystal with no acceptors, which implies $N_{A} = 0$ and thus $N_{A}^{-} = 0$. Furthermore, for an $n$-type material in the specified temperature regimes (freeze-out and extrinsic), the hole concentration is negligible compared to the electron concentration, so we can approximate $p \\approx 0$. Applying these conditions simplifies the charge neutrality equation to:\n$$n \\approx N_{D}^{+}$$\n\nNext, we must express $n$ and $N_{D}^{+}$ in terms of fundamental parameters.\nThe free-electron concentration, $n$, in a nondegenerate semiconductor is given by the Maxwell-Boltzmann approximation:\n$$n = N_{C}(T) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_F}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\nwhere $N_{C}(T)$ is the effective density of states in the conduction band, $E_C$ is the conduction-band edge energy, $E_F$ is the Fermi level, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.

The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\n**1. Fundamental Principles**\n\nFor a nondegenerate semiconductor, the electron ($n$) and hole ($p$) concentrations are given by the Boltzmann approximation to the Fermi-Dirac distribution:\n$$ n = N_c(T) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_c - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) $$\n$$ p = N_v(T) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_v}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nwhere $E_F$ is the Fermi level, and $N_c(T) \\propto T^{3/2}$ and $N_v(T) \\propto T^{3/2}$ are the effective densities of states in the conduction and valence bands, respectively.\n\nThe product of these concentrations yields the law of mass action:\n$$ np = N_c N_v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_c - E_v}{k_B T}\\right) = N_c N_v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{k_B T}\\right) \\equiv n_i(T)^2 $$\nThe intrinsic carrier concentration is therefore:\n$$ n_i(T) = \\sqrt{N_c N_v} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{2 k_B T}\\right) $$\nSince $\\sqrt{N_c N_v} \\propto T^{3/2}$, the temperature dependence is $n_i(T) \\propto T^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{2 k_B T}\\right)$.\n\nThe system must also obey charge neutrality. Assuming all shallow acceptors are ionized ($N_A^- \\approx N_A$), the neutrality equation is:\n$$ n + N_A = p + N_D^+ $$\nwhere $N_D^+$ is the concentration of ionized donors.\n\n**2. Carrier Concentration in Limiting Regimes**\n\n**a) Intrinsic Regime (High Temperatures)**\nAt sufficiently high temperatures, thermal generation across the band gap dominates any doping effects, so $n \\approx p \\gg (N_D - N_A)$. In this limit, the carrier concentration is approximately the intrinsic concentration:\n$$ n(T) \\approx n_i(T) = \\sqrt{N_c(T) N_v(T)} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{2 k_B T}\\right) $$\nThe activation energy observed in an Arrhenius plot of $n(T)$ (with pre-factors properly accounted for) is $E_g/2$.\n\n**b) Donor Freeze-out Regime (Low Temperatures)**\nAt low temperatures, thermal energy is insufficient to ionize all donors. We can assume hole concentration is negligible ($p \\approx 0$). The law of mass action applied to the donor level ionization equilibrium ($D^0 \\leftrightarrow D^+ + e^-$) is:\n$$ \\frac{n N_D^+}{N_D^0} = \\frac{N_c}{g_D} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_b}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nwhere $N_D^0 = N_D - N_D^+$ is the neutral donor concentration and $g_D$ is the donor level degeneracy factor (typically $g_D=2$). From charge neutrality, $N_D^+ = n + N_A$. Substituting this and $N_D^0 = N_D - (n+N_A)$ into the equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{n (n+N_A)}{N_D - N_A - n} = \\frac{N_c}{g_D} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_b}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nThis is the governing equation for $n(T)$ in the freeze-out and extrinsic regimes. We analyze a specific case relevant to the options: in part of the freeze-out regime, it is possible that $n \\gg N_A$ but still $n \\ll (N_D - N_A)$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{n^2}{N_D - N_A} \\approx \\frac{N_c}{g_D} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_b}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nRearranging for $n^2$:\n$$ n(T)^2 \\approx \\frac{(N_D - N_A)}{g_D} N_c(T) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_b}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nSince $N_c(T) \\propto T^{3/2}$, we have $n(T)^2 \\propto T^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_b}{k_B T}\\right)$. The apparent activation energy in a simple $\\ln(n)$ vs $1/T$ plot would be $E_b/2$.\n\n**3. Critique of the Researcher's Claim**\n\nThe researcher claims that slopes from a $\\ln \\sigma$ vs $1/T$ plot directly yield activation energies. The conductivity $\\sigma$ is given by the two-carrier formula:\n$$ \\sigma(T) = e(n(T)\\mu_n(T) + p(T)\\mu_p(T)) $$\nwhere $\\mu_n$ and $\\mu_p$ are the electron and hole mobilities. In an $n$-type material away from the deep intrinsic regime, $n \\gg p$, so $\\sigma(T) \\approx e n(T) \\mu_n(T)$.\nTaking the logarithm:\n$$ \\ln \\sigma(T) = \\ln(e) + \\ln n(T) + \\ln \\mu_n(T) $$\nThe slope of an Arrhenius plot is given by the derivative with respect to $1/T$:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\ln \\sigma)}{d(1/T)} = \\frac{d(\\ln n)}{d(1/T)} + \\frac{d(\\ln \\mu_n)}{d(1/T)} $$\nMobility is itself a function of temperature. For example, due to lattice scattering, $\\mu_n \\propto T^{-3/2}$, and due to ionized impurity scattering, $\\mu_n \\propto T^{3/2}$. In either case, $\\ln \\mu_n(T)$ has a non-zero temperature dependence, meaning the term $\\frac{d(\\ln \\mu_n)}{d(1/T)}$ is non-zero. This term adds to the slope due to carrier activation, confounding the direct extraction of $E_b$ or $E_g/2$. The researcher's claim is therefore a common but incorrect oversimplification. Any valid method must first isolate the temperature dependence of the carrier concentration $n(T)$.\n\n**4. Evaluation of Options**\n\n-   **A. Use the Hall effect to extract $n(T)$ and plot $\\ln\\!\\big(n(T)/T^{3/2}\\big)$ versus $1/T$. A linear high-temperature segment whose slope is independent of $N_D$ identifies $E_g/2$.**\n\n    In a regime where a single carrier type dominates (e.g., extrinsic $n$-type), the Hall coefficient is $R_H \\approx -1/(en)$. This allows for the experimental extraction of $n(T) = -1/(e R_H(T))$, thus separating the carrier concentration from the mobility. To find the activation energy, one must analyze $n(T)$.\n    In the intrinsic regime, $n(T) \\approx n_i(T) \\propto T^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{2 k_B T}\\right)$.\n    The proposed plot variable is $\\ln(n(T)/T^{3/2})$.\n    $$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{n(T)}{T^{3/2}}\\right) \\approx \\ln\\left(\\frac{C \\cdot T^{3/2} \\exp(-E_g / (2 k_B T))}{T^{3/2}}\\right) = \\ln(C) - \\frac{E_g}{2 k_B T} $$\n    where $C$ is a constant. A plot of $\\ln(n/T^{3/2})$ versus $1/T$ will therefore be linear with a slope of $-E_g/(2 k_B)$. This method correctly accounts for the temperature-dependent pre-factor $T^{3/2}$ stemming from the density of states. Furthermore, the band gap $E_g$ is an intrinsic property of the semiconductor, so the resulting slope should be independent of the donor concentration $N_D$. This provides a key signature for identifying the intrinsic regime correctly. This diagnostic is valid.\n    \n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **B. Plot $\\ln \\sigma(T)$ versus $1/T$ and read the high-temperature slope. This always yields $E_g/2$ because $\\sigma$ is dominated by thermal generation at high $T$.**\n\n    As explained in the critique above, this method is fundamentally flawed. The conductivity $\\sigma(T)$ is a product of carrier concentration and mobility, both of which are temperature-dependent. The slope of a $\\ln \\sigma$ plot is a sum of contributions from both factors. The statement \"always yields $E_g/2$\" is false, as the temperature dependence of mobility will skew the result.\n\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **C. In the donor freeze-out regime, plot $\\ln\\!\\big(n(T)^2/T^{3/2}\\big)$ versus $1/T$. Linearity with slope $-E_b/k_B$ identifies the donor binding energy from the low-temperature data.**\n\n    This option proposes a method for the donor freeze-out regime. As derived in section 2b, for the case where $n \\gg N_A$ (valid in a lightly compensated sample over a portion of the freeze-out range), we have $n(T)^2 \\propto T^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_b}{k_B T}\\right)$.\n    Let us analyze the proposed plot of $\\ln(n(T)^2/T^{3/2})$ versus $1/T$:\n    $$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{n(T)^2}{T^{3/2}}\\right) \\propto \\ln\\left(\\frac{C' \\cdot T^{3/2} \\exp(-E_b / (k_B T))}{T^{3/2}}\\right) = \\ln(C') - \\frac{E_b}{k_B T} $$\n    where $C'$ is a constant. This plot is indeed linear with a slope of $-E_b/k_B$. This diagnostic correctly extracts the donor binding energy $E_b$ under the specified conditions. It is a valid method for determining one of the key energies, which is essential for distinguishing it from $E_g/2$.\n\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **D. Diagnose the intrinsic regime by the collapse of $|R_H|$ from the single-carrier value $1/(e n)$ and its approach to the two-carrier form. A concurrent linear $\\ln\\!\\big(n(T)/T^{3/2}\\big)$ versus $1/T$ segment then yields $E_g/2$.**\n\n    This option describes a complete experimental procedure.\n    1.  **Diagnose the regime:** In the extrinsic (exhaustion) regime, $n \\approx N_D-N_A$ is constant and $p \\approx 0$, so $|R_H| \\approx 1/(e(N_D-N_A))$ is constant. As temperature increases and the intrinsic regime is approached, both $n$ and $p$ increase exponentially. The Hall coefficient for two carriers is $R_H = (p \\mu_p^2 - n \\mu_n^2)/(e(p\\mu_p + n\\mu_n)^2)$. The denominator grows very rapidly with temperature while the numerator (a difference of two large terms) grows less rapidly or decreases. This causes a characteristic sharp drop (\"collapse\") in the magnitude of $|R_H|$. This collapse is a standard and robust experimental signature for the onset of two-carrier conduction, i.e., the intrinsic regime.\n    2.  **Analyze carrier concentration:** The option then states that a linear segment in the $\\ln(n/T^{3/2})$ vs $1/T$ plot, observed concurrently with the collapse of $|R_H|$, identifies $E_g/2$. As shown for option A, this analysis method is correct.\n    Combining a clear physical signature (the collapse of $|R_H|$) to identify the correct temperature range with the correct analysis plot ($\\ln(n/T^{3/2})$ vs $1/T$) constitutes a powerful and reliable diagnostic procedure. It avoids misinterpreting slopes from crossover regions.\n\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **E. Compare the Arrhenius slopes of $\\ln \\sigma$ versus $1/T$ across samples with different donor concentrations $N_D$. If the slope varies with $N_D$, it must correspond to $E_g/2$, not $E_b$.**\n\n    This statement contains a logical flaw. The band gap energy $E_g$ is an intrinsic property of the semiconductor material itself. For light doping levels, it is essentially independent of the donor concentration $N_D$. Therefore, the activation energy $E_g/2$ derived in the intrinsic regime should be the *same* for samples with different $N_D$. Conversely, the donor binding energy $E_b$ can show a weak dependence on $N_D$ due to screening effects at higher concentrations, and the temperature ranges for freeze-out are strongly dependent on $N_D$. Therefore, if an Arrhenius slope is found to be *independent* of $N_D$, it is a candidate for $E_g/2$. If the slope *varies* with $N_D$, it is more likely related to donor phenomena (or experimental artifacts). The option states the exact opposite.\n\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "3018394"}]}
