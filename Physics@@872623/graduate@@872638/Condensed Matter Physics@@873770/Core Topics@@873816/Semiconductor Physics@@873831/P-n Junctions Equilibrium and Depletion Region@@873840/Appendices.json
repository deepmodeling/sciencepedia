Focus on a point deep inside one quasi-neutral region, far from the depletion edge, such that the electrostatic potential is spatially uniform there and the space charge density vanishes. The donors and acceptors are shallow and fully ionized at the operating temperature $T$, the semiconductor is nondegenerate so that Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics apply, and no deep traps are present. Let the donor density be $N_D$, the acceptor density be $N_A$, and the intrinsic carrier density be $n_i$. \n\nStarting only from (i) the definition of space charge density in terms of mobile carriers and ionized dopants, (ii) the condition of electrostatic charge neutrality in a quasi-neutral region at equilibrium, and (iii) the relation between carrier densities and the equilibrium Fermi level implied by Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics, proceed as follows:\n\n1.

It presents a standard, solvable problem in semiconductor physics without any internal contradictions, missing information, or factual errors.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the equilibrium electron and hole concentrations, denoted as $n_0$ and $p_0$ respectively, in a compensated semiconductor. The derivation must start from fundamental principles and result in a single, closed-form expression for the pair $(n_0, p_0)$ that is valid irrespective of whether the material is n-type ($N_D  N_A$) or p-type ($N_A  N_D$).\n\nStep 1: The Charge Neutrality Condition\n\nThe first given starting point is the definition of space charge density, $\\rho$. In a semiconductor with donor and acceptor impurities, $\\rho$ is the sum of the charge contributions from mobile electrons (concentration $n$, charge $-q$), mobile holes (concentration $p$, charge $+q$), ionized donors (concentration $N_D^+$, charge $+q$), and ionized acceptors (concentration $N_A^-$, charge $-q$). The elementary charge is $q$.\n$$ \\rho = q(p - n + N_D^+ - N_A^-) $$\nThe problem states that the donors and acceptors are shallow and fully ionized at the operating temperature $T$. This implies that every donor atom has donated an electron, and every acceptor atom has accepted an electron. Therefore, the concentrations of ionized donors and acceptors are equal to their respective total concentrations:\n$$ N_D^+ = N_D $$\n$$ N_A^- = N_A $$\nThe space charge density is then:\n$$ \\rho = q(p - n + N_D - N_A) $$\nThe problem specifies that we are considering a point deep inside a quasi-neutral region at equilibrium. In such a region, the net space charge density is zero ($\\rho=0$). Denoting the equilibrium carrier concentrations as $n_0$ and $p_0$, the charge neutrality condition is:\n$$ q(p_0 - n_0 + N_D - N_A) = 0 $$\n$$ p_0 - n_0 + N_D - N_A = 0 $$\nThis can be rearranged to express the difference between the electron and hole concentrations in terms of the net doping concentration:\n$$ n_0 - p_0 = N_D - N_A $$\nThis equation represents the charge neutrality condition that holds in the quasi-neutral region.\n\nStep 2: Derivation of Carrier Concentrations\n\nThe second principle to be used is the relation between carrier densities implied by Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics for a nondegenerate semiconductor at thermal equilibrium. This relationship is the law of mass action, which states that the product of the electron and hole concentrations is constant for a given temperature and material, and is equal to the square of the intrinsic carrier concentration, $n_i$.\n$$ n_0 p_0 = n_i^2 $$\nWe now have a system of two equations with two unknowns, $n_0$ and $p_0$:\n1. $n_0 - p_0 = N_D - N_A$\n2. $n_0 p_0 = n_i^2$\n\nWe can solve this system. From equation (2), we can express $p_0$ as $p_0 = \\frac{n_i^2}{n_0}$. Substituting this expression into equation (1):\n$$ n_0 - \\frac{n_i^2}{n_0} = N_D - N_A $$\nMultiplying all terms by $n_0$ (which is non-zero) to clear the denominator, we obtain a quadratic equation for $n_0$:\n$$ n_0^2 - (N_D - N_A)n_0 - n_i^2 = 0 $$\nThis is a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, with $x = n_0$, $a = 1$, $b = -(N_D - N_A)$, and $c = -n_i^2$. The solution for $n_0$ is given by the quadratic formula:\n$$ n_0 = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$\n$$ n_0 = \\frac{(N_D - N_A) \\pm \\sqrt{(-(N_D - N_A))^2 - 4(1)(-n_i^2)}}{2(1)} $$\n$$ n_0 = \\frac{N_D - N_A \\pm \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2} $$\nSince carrier concentration must be a positive physical quantity ($n_0  0$), we must choose the appropriate sign. The term under the square root, $\\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}$, is strictly greater than $|\\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2}| = |N_D - N_A|$. If we choose the minus sign, the numerator $(N_D - N_A) - \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}$ would be negative, leading to an unphysical negative concentration. Therefore, we must select the plus sign.\nThe exact expression for the equilibrium electron concentration is:\n$$ n_0 = \\frac{N_D - N_A + \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2} $$\nThis expression is general and holds for both n-type ($N_D  N_A$) and p-type ($N_A  N_D$) compensated semiconductors.\n\nTo find the expression for the hole concentration $p_0$, we can follow a similar procedure. We express $n_0$ from equation (1) as $n_0 = p_0 + (N_D - N_A)$ and substitute it into equation (2):\n$$ (p_0 + N_D - N_A)p_0 = n_i^2 $$\n$$ p_0^2 + (N_D - N_A)p_0 - n_i^2 = 0 $$\nSolving for $p_0$ using the quadratic formula:\n$$ p_0 = \\frac{-(N_D - N_A) \\pm \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 - 4(1)(-n_i^2)}}{2} $$\n$$ p_0 = \\frac{-(N_D - N_A) \\pm \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2} $$\nAgain, $p_0$ must be positive. The numerator with the minus sign would be negative, which is unphysical. Thus, we must choose the plus sign:\n$$ p_0 = \\frac{-(N_D - N_A) + \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2} $$\nThis can be rewritten by distributing the negative sign in the first term:\n$$ p_0 = \\frac{N_A - N_D + \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2} $$\nSince $(N_D - N_A)^2 = (N_A - N_D)^2$, the expression remains valid and general.\n\nAs a check, we can verify that $n_0 p_0 = n_i^2$. Let $\\Delta N = N_D - N_A$.\n$n_0 = \\frac{1}{2}(\\Delta N + \\sqrt{(\\Delta N)^2 + 4n_i^2})$\n$p_0 = \\frac{1}{2}(-\\Delta N + \\sqrt{(\\Delta N)^2 + 4n_i^2})$\n$n_0 p_0 = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( (\\sqrt{(\\Delta N)^2 + 4n_i^2})^2 - (\\Delta N)^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( ((\\Delta N)^2 + 4n_i^2) - (\\Delta N)^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{4}(4n_i^2) = n_i^2$.\nThe expressions are consistent.\n\nDiscussion of Limiting Cases:\nFor an n-type compensated semiconductor with net doping $N_D - N_A \\gg n_i$:\n$\\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2} \\approx \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2} = N_D - N_A$.\n$n_0 \\approx \\frac{1}{2}(N_D - N_A + N_D - N_A) = N_D - N_A$.\n$p_0 \\approx \\frac{1}{2}(-(N_D - N_A) + N_D - N_A) = 0$. More accurately, $p_0 = n_i^2/n_0 \\approx \\frac{n_i^2}{N_D - N_A}$.\nFor a p-type compensated semiconductor with net doping $N_A - N_D \\gg n_i$:\n$\\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2} = \\sqrt{(N_A - N_D)^2 + 4n_i^2} \\approx N_A - N_D$.\n$p_0 \\approx \\frac{1}{2}(N_A - N_D + N_A - N_D) = N_A - N_D$.\n$n_0 \\approx \\frac{1}{2}(-(N_A - N_D) + N_A - N_D) = 0$. More accurately, $n_0 = n_i^2/p_0 \\approx \\frac{n_i^2}{N_A - N_D}$.\nThe general formulae correctly reduce to the expected approximations in the extrinsic limits.\n\nThe required final answer is the ordered pair $(n_0, p_0)$ presented as a single closed-form expression.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} \\left( N_D - N_A + \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2} \\right)  \\frac{1}{2} \\left( N_A - N_D + \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2} \\right) \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3008680"}, {"introduction": "Having established the properties of bulk semiconductors, we now explore the crucial interface where n-type and p-type materials meet, forming a p-n junction.

Then $du = -N_D(x'')dx''$ and $v = x''$.\n    $$\n    \\int_0^{W_n} u(x'') dv = [x'' u(x'')]_0^{W_n} - \\int_0^{W_n} x''(-N_D(x''))dx''\n    $$\n    $$\n    = \\left(W_n \\int_{W_n}^{W_n} N_D(x') dx' - 0\\right) + \\int_0^{W_n} x'' N_D(x'') dx'' = \\int_0^{W_n} x N_D(x) dx\n    $$\n    Thus, the potential drop has a simpler, more computationally efficient form:\n    $$\n    \\Delta\\phi_n = \\frac{q}{\\varepsilon_s} \\int_0^{W_n} x N_D(x) dx\n    $$\n\nTo solve the specific problem with $N_D(x) = N_0 e^{\\alpha x}$, we evaluate these two single integrals.\n\nFor $E(0)$, we compute $\\int_0^{W_n} N_0 e^{\\alpha x} dx$:\n- If $\\alpha \\neq 0$: $\\int_0^{W_n} N_0 e^{\\alpha x} dx = N_0 \\left[ \\frac{e^{\\alpha x}}{\\alpha} \\right]_0^{W_n} = \\frac{N_0}{\\alpha} (e^{\\alpha W_n} - 1)$.\n- If $\\alpha = 0$: $\\int_0^{W_n} N_0 dx = N_0 W_n$.\nSo, the formulas for $E(0)$ are:\n$$\nE(0) = \\begin{cases} - \\frac{q N_0}{\\varepsilon_s \\alpha} (e^{\\alpha W_n} - 1)  \\text{if } \\alpha \\neq 0 \\\\ - \\frac{q N_0 W_n}{\\varepsilon_s}  \\text{if } \\alpha = 0 \\end{cases}\n$$\n\nFor $\\Delta\\phi_n$, we compute $\\int_0^{W_n} x N_0 e^{\\alpha x} dx$:\n- If $\\alpha \\neq 0$, using integration by parts $\\int x e^{\\alpha x} dx = \\frac{x e^{\\alpha x}}{\\alpha} - \\frac{e^{\\alpha x}}{\\alpha^2}$:\n$\\int_0^{W_n} x N_0 e^{\\alpha x} dx = N_0 \\left[ \\frac{x e^{\\alpha x}}{\\alpha} - \\frac{e^{\\alpha x}}{\\alpha^2} \\right]_0^{W_n} = \\frac{N_0}{\\alpha^2} [(\\alpha W_n - 1)e^{\\alpha W_n} + 1]$.\n- If $\\alpha = 0$: $\\int_0^{W_n} x N_0 dx = N_0 \\left[ \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_0^{W_n} = \\frac{N_0 W_n^2}{2}$.\nSo, the formulas for $\\Delta\\phi_n$ are:\n$$\n\\Delta\\phi_n = \\begin{cases} \\frac{q N_0}{\\varepsilon_s \\alpha^2} [(\\alpha W_n - 1)e^{\\alpha W_n} + 1]  \\text{if } \\alpha \\neq 0 \\\\ \\frac{q N_0 W_n^2}{2 \\varepsilon_s}  \\text{if } \\alpha = 0 \\end{cases}\n$$\nThese formulas are implemented to compute the required values for each test case.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\n\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the p-n junction problem for a given set of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define physical constants.\n    Q = 1.602176634e-19  # Elementary charge in Coulombs\n    EPSILON_0 = 8.8541878128e-12  # Vacuum permittivity in F/m\n    EPSILON_R_SI = 11.7  # Relative permittivity of Silicon\n    EPSILON_S = EPSILON_R_SI * EPSILON_0  # Permittivity of Silicon\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case is a tuple: (N0 (m^-3), alpha (m^-1), Wn (m))\n    test_cases = [\n        (1.0e22, 1.0e6, 5.0e-7),   # Case 1: Happy path, moderate grading\n        (1.0e22, 0.0, 5.0e-7),    # Case 2: Boundary, uniform doping limit\n        (5.0e21, -1.0e6, 5.0e-7), # Case 3: Edge, negative grading\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n\n    def round_to_sig_figs(x, n):\n        \"\"\"\n        Rounds a number x to n significant figures.\n        Returns a float.\n        \"\"\"\n        if x == 0:\n            return 0.0\n        if not np.isfinite(x):\n            return x\n        \n        power = n - int(math.floor(math.log10(abs(x)))) - 1\n        return round(x, power)\n\n    for n0, alpha, wn in test_cases:\n        delta_phi_n = 0.0\n        e_at_0 = 0.0\n\n        if alpha == 0.0:\n            # Uniform doping case\n            # Calculate potential drop delta_phi_n\n            delta_phi_n = (Q * n0 * wn**2) / (2 * EPSILON_S)\n            \n            # Calculate electric field at the junction E(0)\n            e_at_0 = - (Q * n0 * wn) / EPSILON_S\n        else:\n            # Exponentially graded doping case\n            aw = alpha * wn\n            exp_aw = np.exp(aw)\n            \n            # Calculate potential drop delta_phi_n\n            term_phi = (aw - 1) * exp_aw + 1\n            delta_phi_n = (Q * n0 / (EPSILON_S * alpha**2)) * term_phi\n            \n            # Calculate electric field at the junction E(0)\n            term_e = exp_aw - 1\n            e_at_0 = - (Q * n0 / (EPSILON_S * alpha)) * term_e\n\n        # Round results to six significant figures\n        rounded_delta_phi_n = round_to_sig_figs(delta_phi_n, 6)\n        rounded_e_at_0 = round_to_sig_figs(e_at_0, 6)\n\n        results.append(rounded_delta_phi_n)\n        results.append(rounded_e_at_0)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3008710"}]}
