The Kramers-Kronig relations are a direct consequence of this analyticity. The standard form of the KK relations requires that the function vanishes as the frequency approaches infinity. The given dielectric function has a high-frequency limit of $\\epsilon(\\infty)=1$, so it does not vanish at infinity.\n\nThe problem statement correctly prompts us to consider subtractions.
