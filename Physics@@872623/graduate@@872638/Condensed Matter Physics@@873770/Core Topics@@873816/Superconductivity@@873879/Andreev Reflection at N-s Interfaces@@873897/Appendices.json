The interface potential is $V(x) = H\\delta(x)$.\n\nThe Andreev approximation simplifies the problem by linearizing the electronic dispersion around the Fermi energy. In this approximation, the wavefunctions are written as products of rapidly oscillating plane waves $e^{\\pm ik_F x}$ and slowly varying envelope functions. The BdG equations reduce to a set of first-order differential equations for these envelopes. A standard and powerful method, developed by Blonder, Tinkham, and Klapwijk (BTK), solves this scattering problem by relating the N-S interface properties to the known normal-state scattering properties of the barrier, characterized by the dimensionless strength $Z = H/(\\hbar v_F)$. The problem statement allows the use of such \"well-tested facts\".\n\nThe BTK model provides expressions for the Andreev reflection amplitude $a$ and the normal reflection amplitude $b$ for an electron incident from the normal metal. For $E  \\Delta$, there are no propagating quasiparticle states in the superconductor, so an incident electron is either normally reflected (as an electron) or Andreev reflected (as a hole). The reflection amplitudes are given in terms of the superconducting coherence factors and the barrier strength $Z$.\n\nFor energies $E  \\Delta$, the relevant coherence factors are complex.

For a transparent interface ($Z=0$), Andreev reflection is perfect, $A(0)=1$, as the electron perfectly converts to a hole. The presence of a barrier ($Z0$) introduces a normal reflection channel that competes with Andreev reflection. The barrier suppresses the coupling, thus reducing the Andreev reflection probability. For a large barrier ($Z \\gg 1$), $A(0) \\approx 1/(4Z^4)$, indicating strong suppression.\n\n2.  **Limit as $E \\to \\Delta^-$ (from subgap energies)**:\n    In this limit, the term $(\\Delta^2 - E^2) \\to 0$.

Physically, the density of quasiparticle states in a BCS superconductor diverges at the gap edge ($E=\\Delta$). This resonant enhancement of available states for the transmitted particle to couple into leads to perfect Andreev reflection, irrespective of the finite barrier strength. The electron incident at the gap edge energy is certain to be converted into a hole. For the ideal case $Z=0$, $A(E)=1$ for all $E\\Delta$. For $Z0$, $A(E)$ starts at a value less than $1$ at $E=0$ and rises to $1$ as $E$ approaches $\\Delta$.\n\nThe full derivation, based on the fundamental principles of the BdG equations, leads through the well-established BTK formalism to the final expression for $A(E)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\Delta^2}{E^2 + (\\Delta^2 - E^2)(1+2Z^2)^2}}\n$$", "id": "2969764"}, {"introduction": "While ideal theoretical models provide crucial insights, real-world experimental spectra are invariably broadened by factors like inelastic scattering.

At zero temperature, the differential conductance $G(V) = dI/dV$ measures the rate at which charge carriers can enter the superconductor at an energy $E=eV$ above its Fermi level. In the tunneling limit, characterized by a large dimensionless barrier parameter $Z \\to \\infty$, the probability of transmission for any single particle is very low. In this regime, standard tunneling theory applies, which states that the tunneling current is a convolution of the density of states of the two electrodes. For a Normal-Superconductor (N-S) junction at zero temperature, this simplifies to the differential conductance being directly proportional to the density of states in the superconductor at the energy corresponding to the bias voltage, i.e., $G(V) \\propto N_s(E=eV)$. The conductance is normalized by the conductance in the normal state, $G_N$, which is constant and proportional to the normal state DOS, $N_0$.
