Equilibrium Order Parameter**\n\nThe free-energy density is given by\n$$\nf(\\eta;T) = f_{n}(T) + a(T)\\,|\\eta|^{2} + \\frac{b}{2}\\,|\\eta|^{4}\n$$\nSince the phase of the complex order parameter $\\eta$ does not affect the energy, we only need to minimize $f$ with respect to its magnitude $|\\eta|$. To simplify, we minimize with respect to $|\\eta|^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial (|\\eta|^2)} = a(T) + b\\,|\\eta|^2 = 0\n$$\nThis yields a potential equilibrium value for $|\\eta|^2$:\n$$\n|\\eta|^2 = -\\frac{a(T)}{b}\n$$\nTo check if this is a minimum, we compute the second derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial (|\\eta|^2)^2} = b\n$$\nSince $b  0$, this represents a local minimum. However, the solution $|\\eta|^2 = -a(T)/b$ is only physically meaningful if $|\\eta|^2 \\ge 0$. Given $a(T) = a_0(T - T_c)$ with $a_0  0$ and $b  0$, the condition $-a(T)/b \\ge 0$ implies $-(T-T_c) \\ge 0$, which means $T \\le T_c$.\n\nWe must also consider the solution $|\\eta|^2=0$.\n*   For $T  T_c$, $a(T)  0$. The derivative $\\partial f / \\partial(|\\eta|^2) = a(T) + b|\\eta|^2$ is always positive for $|\\eta|^2  0$. Thus, the free energy is a monotonically increasing function of $|\\eta|^2$, and its minimum occurs at $|\\eta|^2 = 0$. This corresponds to the normal state.\n*   For $T \\le T_c$, $a(T) \\le 0$. We have two potential extrema: $|\\eta|^2=0$ and $|\\eta|^2 = -a(T)/b \\ge 0$. Comparing the free energy at these two points shows that $|\\eta|^2 = -a(T)/b$ gives a lower free energy, making it the stable equilibrium state. This is the ordered (superconducting) state.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium order parameter magnitude squared, $|\\eta_{\\text{eq}}|^2$, is:\n$$\n|\\eta_{\\text{eq}}|^2 = \\begin{cases} 0  \\text{for } T  T_c \\\\ -\\frac{a(T)}{b} = \\frac{a_0(T_c - T)}{b}  \\text{for } T \\le T_c \\end{cases}\n$$\n\n**2. Equilibrium Free-Energy Difference**\n\nWe now calculate the equilibrium free-energy density, $f_{\\text{eq}}(T)$, by substituting $|\\eta_{\\text{eq}}|^2$ back into the expression for $f$.\n*   For $T  T_c$ (normal state, subscript $n$):\n    $|\\eta_{\\text{eq}}|^2 = 0$, so $f_{\\text{eq}}(T) = f_{n}(T)$.\n*   For $T \\le T_c$ (superconducting state, subscript $s$):\n    $|\\eta_{\\text{eq}}|^2 = -a(T)/b$.\n    $$\n    f_s(T) = f_n(T) + a(T)\\left(-\\frac{a(T)}{b}\\right) + \\frac{b}{2}\\left(-\\frac{a(T)}{b}\\right)^2\n    $$\n    $$\n    f_s(T) = f_n(T) - \\frac{a(T)^2}{b} + \\frac{b}{2}\\frac{a(T)^2}{b^2} = f_n(T) - \\frac{a(T)^2}{2b}\n    $$\nThe equilibrium free-energy difference between the superconducting and normal states for $T \\le T_c$ is:\n$$\nf_{s}(T) - f_{n}(T) = -\\frac{a(T)^2}{2b} = -\\frac{\\left(a_0(T-T_c)\\right)^2}{2b} = -\\frac{a_0^2}{2b}(T-T_c)^2\n$$\n\n**3. Specific Heat and the Jump $\\Delta C$**\n\nThe specific heat is defined as $C(T) = -T \\, \\partial^2 f_{\\text{eq}}(T) / \\partial T^2$. We compute it for both states.\n*   For $T  T_c$ (normal state):\n    $f_{\\text{eq}}(T) = f_n(T)$. The specific heat is $C_n(T) = -T \\, \\partial^2 f_n(T) / \\partial T^2$. This is the background specific heat, which we assume is a regular function of $T$ near $T_c$.\n*   For $T \\le T_c$ (superconducting state):\n    $f_s(T) = f_n(T) - \\frac{a_0^2}{2b}(T-T_c)^2$. We take the derivatives with respect to $T$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial f_s}{\\partial T} = \\frac{\\partial f_n}{\\partial T} - \\frac{a_0^2}{b}(T - T_c)\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial^2 f_s}{\\partial T^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f_n}{\\partial T^2} - \\frac{a_0^2}{b}\n    $$\n    The specific heat in the superconducting state is:\n    $$\n    C_s(T) = -T \\frac{\\partial^2 f_s}{\\partial T^2} = -T \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 f_n}{\\partial T^2} - \\frac{a_0^2}{b} \\right) = -T \\frac{\\partial^2 f_n}{\\partial T^2} + \\frac{T a_0^2}{b} = C_n(T) + \\frac{T a_0^2}{b}\n    $$\nThe heat-capacity jump at $T_c$ is defined as $\\Delta C = \\lim_{T \\to T_{c}^{-}} C_{s}(T) - \\lim_{T \\to T_{c}^{+}} C_{n}(T)$.\n$$\n\\lim_{T \\to T_{c}^{-}} C_{s}(T) = \\lim_{T \\to T_{c}^{-}} \\left( C_n(T) + \\frac{T a_0^2}{b} \\right) = C_n(T_c) + \\frac{T_c a_0^2}{b}\n$$\n$$\n\\lim_{T \\to T_{c}^{+}} C_{n}(T) = C_n(T_c)\n$$\nAssuming $C_n(T)$ is continuous at $T_c$, the jump is:\n$$\n\\Delta C = \\left( C_n(T_c) + \\frac{T_c a_0^2}{b} \\right) - C_n(T_c) = \\frac{T_c a_0^2}{b}\n$$\n\n**4. Critical Exponent $\\alpha$ and Nature of the Discontinuity**\n\nThe singular part of the specific heat, $C_{\\text{sing}}(T)$, is the contribution arising from the phase transition, which is the difference between the total specific heat and the regular background part, $C_n(T)$.\n$$\nC_{\\text{sing}}(T) = C(T) - C_n(T)\n$$\nFrom our previous results:\n$$\nC_{\\text{sing}}(T) = \\begin{cases} 0  \\text{for } T  T_c \\\\ \\frac{T a_0^2}{b}  \\text{for } T \\le T_c \\end{cases}\n$$\nThis shows that $C_{\\text{sing}}(T)$ is zero above $T_c$ and approaches a finite, non-zero value, $T_c a_0^2/b$, as $T \\to T_c$ from below. This behavior is a finite jump discontinuity.\n\nThe critical exponent $\\alpha$ describes the behavior of $C_{\\text{sing}}$ as $T \\to T_c$ via the scaling relation $C_{\\text{sing}}(T) \\sim |t|^{-\\alpha}$, where $t = (T-T_c)/T_c$.\n*   If $\\alpha  0$, $C_{\\text{sing}}$ diverges.\n*   If $\\alpha  0$, $C_{\\text{sing}}$ goes to zero.\n*   If $\\alpha = 0$, the behavior is a jump or a logarithmic divergence.\n\nIn our case, $C_{\\text{sing}}(T)$ has a finite discontinuity at $T_c$. This corresponds to a critical exponent $\\alpha=0$. This is a characteristic result of mean-field theories like the Ginzburg-Landau theory presented. The behavior at $T_c$ is therefore a finite discontinuity, not a divergence.\n\nCombining the results, the heat-capacity jump is $\\Delta C = \\frac{T_c a_0^2}{b}$ and the specific-heat critical exponent is $\\alpha=0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{T_c a_0^2}{b}  0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2992432"}, {"introduction": "While uniform systems provide a starting point, real-world phenomena involve spatial variations.

Using Parseval's theorem, the free energy can be written in terms of the Fourier components:\n$$\n\\int d^d r \\, \\phi^2 = \\int \\frac{d^d q}{(2\\pi)^d} |\\tilde{\\phi}(\\boldsymbol{q})|^2\n$$\n$$\n\\int d^d r \\, |\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\phi|^2 = \\int \\frac{d^d q}{(2\\pi)^d} q^2 |\\tilde{\\phi}(\\boldsymbol{q})|^2\n$$\nThe Gaussian free energy in Fourier space is therefore:\n$$\nF_{Gauss}[\\tilde{\\phi}] \\,=\\, \\frac{1}{2} \\int \\frac{d^d q}{(2\\pi)^d} (a + Kq^2) |\\tilde{\\phi}(\\boldsymbol{q})|^2\n$$\nIn statistical mechanics, the static structure factor $S(\\boldsymbol{q})$ is the thermal average of the squared amplitude of the Fourier modes, $S(\\boldsymbol{q}) = \\langle |\\tilde{\\phi}(\\boldsymbol{q})|^2 \\rangle$. According to the equipartition theorem, the average energy of each quadratic mode is proportional to the temperature $T$. For a continuous field, this is applied to each mode $\\boldsymbol{q}$, leading to:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}(a + Kq^2) \\langle |\\tilde{\\phi}(\\boldsymbol{q})|^2 \\rangle \\propto T\n$$\nThus, the structure factor has the form:\n$$\nS(\\boldsymbol{q}) = \\langle |\\tilde{\\phi}(\\boldsymbol{q})|^2 \\rangle \\propto \\frac{1}{a + Kq^2}\n$$\nThis is an expression of the Ornstein-Zernike form. To make the comparison explicit, we factor out $K$ from the denominator:\n$$\nS(\\boldsymbol{q}) \\propto \\frac{1/K}{(a/K) + q^2}\n$$\nThe standard Ornstein-Zernike form for the structure factor is:\n$$\nS(\\boldsymbol{q}) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\kappa^2 + q^2}\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the inverse correlation length. By comparing the two expressions, we can identify $\\kappa^2$:\n$$\n\\kappa^2 = \\frac{a}{K}\n$$\nGiven that $a0$ and $K0$, the inverse correlation length $\\kappa$ is a positive real number. Taking the square root gives the final expression for $\\kappa$:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{K}}\n$$\nThis result shows that as the system approaches the critical point from the disordered side ($a \\to 0^{+}$), the inverse correlation length $\\kappa$ goes to zero, which means the correlation length $\\xi=1/\\kappa$ diverges, as expected for a continuous phase transition.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{K}}}\n$$", "id": "2992354"}]}
