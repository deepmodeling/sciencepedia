For a quantum particle of charge $q$ and mass $m$, the kinetic momentum operator, which corresponds to the classical mechanical momentum $m\\mathbf{v}$, is given by $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}} = -i\\hbar\\nabla - q\\mathbf{A}$. For a condensate of electrons with charge $q = -e$ (where $e>0$), this becomes:\n$$\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}} = -i\\hbar\\nabla + e\\mathbf{A}\n$$\nThe superconductor is described by a macroscopic wavefunction, $\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sqrt{n_s} \\exp(i\\theta(\\mathbf{r}))$, where $n_s$ is the uniform number density of superconducting electrons and $\\theta(\\mathbf{r})$ is the coherent phase.
