The solution involves analyzing this equation as an eigenvalue problem and relating its solutions to the Landau level quantization of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field.\n\nThe starting point is the linearized GL equation:\n$$\n\\alpha\\,\\psi + \\frac{1}{2 m^*} \\left( - i \\hbar \\nabla - q \\mathbf{A} \\right)^2 \\psi = 0\n$$\nHere, $\\psi$ is the complex order parameter, $\\alpha$ is a temperature-dependent GL coefficient, $m^*$ is the effective mass of a Cooper pair, $q$ is its charge, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $\\mathbf{A}$ is the magnetic vector potential for a uniform magnetic field of magnitude $H$.\n\nWe can rearrange this equation into the form of a time-independent Schrödinger equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2 m^*} \\left( - i \\hbar \\nabla - q \\mathbf{A} \\right)^2 \\psi = -\\alpha \\psi\n$$\nThis is an eigenvalue equation for the kinetic energy operator $\\hat{H}_{\\text{kin}} = \\frac{1}{2 m^*} \\left( - i \\hbar \\nabla - q \\mathbf{A} \\right)^2$.

The problem specifies a uniform magnetic field of magnitude $H$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian are the well-known Landau levels.

The expression for $H_n$ is maximized when the term $1/(n+1/2)$ is maximized. This occurs when the denominator $n+1/2$ is minimized. The minimum value of $n$ is $0$.\n\nThus, the maximum field value corresponds to the lowest Landau level, $n=0$:\n$$\nH_{c2} = H_{n=0} = \\frac{-\\alpha m^*}{2e\\hbar \\left(0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{-\\alpha m^*}{e\\hbar}\n$$\nThe problem's instruction to \"search across Landau-level indices\" is resolved analytically; the maximum is definitively found at $n=0$.\n\nThe computational algorithm is as follows:\n1.

Using the definition of the superfluid momentum for a Cooper pair,\n$$\n\\mathbf{p}_s = \\hbar \\nabla \\varphi - 2 e \\mathbf{A},\n$$\nand Stokes’ theorem for the tangential vector potential in a circular ring, $\\oint \\mathbf{A} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = \\Phi$, where $\\Phi$ is the magnetic flux threading the ring, one finds a uniform tangential superfluid momentum\n$$\np_s = \\frac{\\hbar}{R} \\left( n - \\phi \\right),\n$$\nwhere we introduced the dimensionless flux $\\phi \\equiv \\Phi / \\Phi_0$ with the magnetic flux quantum $\\Phi_0 = h / (2 e)$.\n\nTo assess metastability, we consider the uniform 1D GL state carrying superflow characterized by the wavevector\n$$\nq \\equiv \\frac{p_s}{\\hbar} = \\frac{1}{R} \\left( n - \\phi \\right).\n$$\nFor a uniform amplitude $|\\psi|$, the GL equation reduces to\n$$\n\\alpha \\psi + \\beta |\\psi|^2 \\psi + \\frac{\\hbar^2 q^2}{2 m^{\\ast}} \\psi = 0,\n$$\nwhich yields the amplitude\n$$\n|\\psi|^2 = \\frac{|\\alpha|}{\\beta} \\left( 1 - \\xi^2 q^2 \\right),\n$$\nwhere we used $\\alpha = - |\\alpha|$ below $T_c$ and the Ginzburg–Landau coherence length\n$$\n\\xi^2(T) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m^{\\ast} |\\alpha|}.\n$$\nThe supercurrent density along the ring is\n$$\nj_s = \\frac{2 e \\hbar}{m^{\\ast}} |\\psi|^2 q = \\frac{2 e \\hbar}{m^{\\ast}} \\frac{|\\alpha|}{\\beta} \\, q \\left( 1 - \\xi^2 q^2 \\right).\n$$\nThis current–flow solution is metastable only if small perturbations do not lead to growth of phase-slip fluctuations. Within GL theory for a 1D superconductor, the metastability of the uniform state is lost when the current reaches the depairing threshold, which occurs at the maximum of $j_s(q)$. Differentiating $j_s$ with respect to $q$ and setting the derivative to zero gives\n$$\n\\frac{d j_s}{d q} \\propto \\left( 1 - 3 \\xi^2 q^2 \\right) = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad q_d \\xi = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}.\n$$\nThus, the barrier for phase slips vanishes when the magnitude of the superflow wavevector reaches\n$$\n|q| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3} \\, \\xi}.\n$$\n\nStarting in the $n = 0$ state at low field with increasing $\\phi$, the uniform state has\n$$\nq = - \\frac{\\phi}{R},\n$$\nso the first barrierless phase slip occurs when\n$$\n\\left| - \\frac{\\phi^{\\ast}}{R} \\right| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3} \\, \\xi} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\phi^{\\ast} = \\frac{R}{\\sqrt{3} \\, \\xi}.\n$$\nConverting the dimensionless flux $\\phi^{\\ast}$ to the magnetic field, we use $\\Phi = \\mu_0 H \\, \\pi R^2$ (uniform perpendicular field, negligible screening) so that\n$$\n\\phi^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\Phi^{\\ast}}{\\Phi_0} = \\frac{\\mu_0 H^{\\ast} \\, \\pi R^2}{\\Phi_0}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nH^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\Phi_0}{\\mu_0 \\, \\pi R^2} \\, \\phi^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\Phi_0}{\\mu_0 \\, \\pi R^2} \\, \\frac{R}{\\sqrt{3} \\, \\xi} = \\frac{\\Phi_0}{\\mu_0 \\, \\pi \\sqrt{3} \\, R \\, \\xi}.\n$$\nThis is the characteristic field scale at which the $n=0$ state loses metastability and a barrierless phase slip into $n=1$ occurs. It depends inversely on the product $R \\, \\xi$, reflecting that larger rings or shorter coherence lengths lower the threshold field.\n\nRegarding the lower critical field $H_{c1}$, in a quasi-one-dimensional wire there is no well-defined vortex pattern to enter from the edges, and thus the concept of $H_{c1}$ as the field at which vortices first penetrate a bulk superconductor is not directly relevant. Instead, the magnetic response is governed by fluxoid quantization and superflow stability, with phase slips mediating changes in winding number. The primary field scales are the phase-slip instability field $H^{\\ast}$ derived above and the upper critical field $H_{c2}$ associated with complete orbital (and possibly Zeeman) depairing. In ultra-thin geometries with negligible screening, the onset of dissipation under increasing field is therefore controlled by $H^{\\ast}$ rather than $H_{c1}$, while superconductivity itself is ultimately destroyed near $H_{c2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\Phi_0}{\\mu_0 \\,\\pi \\sqrt{3}\\, R\\, \\xi(T)}}$$", "id": "3002067"}]}
