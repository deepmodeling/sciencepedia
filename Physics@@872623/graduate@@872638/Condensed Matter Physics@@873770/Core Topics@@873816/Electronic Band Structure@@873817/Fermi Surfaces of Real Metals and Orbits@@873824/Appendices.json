All givens are physically and mathematically consistent, and the problem is well-posed. The validation process confirms the problem is valid, so a solution will be provided.\n\nThe energy dispersion for noninteracting electrons on a simple cubic lattice with lattice constant $a$ and nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude $t > 0$ is given as:\n$$E(\\mathbf{k}) = -2t\\left(\\cos(k_x a) + \\cos(k_y a) + \\cos(k_z a)\\right)$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{k} = (k_x, k_y, k_z)$ is the wavevector in the first Brillouin zone (BZ), defined by $-\\pi/a \\leq k_x, k_y, k_z \\leq \\pi/a$.\n\nThe problem states that the lattice is bipartite, having two interpenetrating sublattices. This property imparts a crucial symmetry to the energy spectrum. Let us define a vector $\\mathbf{Q} = (\\pi/a, \\pi/a, \\pi/a)$, which connects the center of the BZ ($\\Gamma$ point) to a corner ($R$ point). We examine the energy of a state with wavevector $\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}$:\n$$E(\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}) = -2t\\left(\\cos((k_x+\\pi/a)a) + \\cos((k_y+\\pi/a)a) + \\cos((k_z+\\pi/a)a)\\right)$$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\cos(\\theta+\\pi) = -\\cos(\\theta)$, we get:\n$$E(\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}) = -2t\\left(-\\cos(k_x a) - \\cos(k_y a) - \\cos(k_z a)\\right)$$\n$$E(\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}) = 2t\\left(\\cos(k_x a) + \\cos(k_y a) + \\cos(k_z a)\\right)$$\nThis shows a direct relationship between $E(\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q})$ and $E(\\mathbf{k})$:\n$$E(\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}) = -E(\\mathbf{k})$$\nThis is the mathematical manifestation of the particle-hole symmetry inherent to a nearest-neighbor tight-binding model on a bipartite lattice.\n\nThe first task is to determine the Fermi energy, $E_F$, at half-filling for noninteracting electrons at zero temperature ($T=0$). At half-filling, the number of electrons is exactly half the total number of available single-particle states in the band. The particle-hole symmetry implies that for every state with energy $E(\\mathbf{k})$, there exists a state with energy $-E(\\mathbf{k})$. The density of states $g(E)$ is therefore symmetric about $E=0$, i.e., $g(E)=g(-E)$. To fill exactly half the states, we must fill all states with negative energy and leave all states with positive energy empty. The chemical potential (which at $T=0$ is the Fermi energy $E_F$) must therefore be located at the energy that separates the occupied and unoccupied states. Due to the symmetry of the density of states, this energy is precisely $E_F = 0$.\n\nThe second task is to derive the implicit equation for the Fermi surface. The Fermi surface is the locus of points in $\\mathbf{k}$-space for which the energy is equal to the Fermi energy. Setting $E(\\mathbf{k}) = E_F = 0$:\n$$-2t\\left(\\cos(k_x a) + \\cos(k_y a) + \\cos(k_z a)\\right) = 0$$\nSince $t>0$, this simplifies to the implicit equation for the Fermi surface:\n$$\\cos(k_x a) + \\cos(k_y a) + \\cos(k_z a) = 0$$\n\nThe third task is to establish whether the Fermi surface is perfectly nested and to find a nesting wavevector. A Fermi surface is perfectly nested if there exists a vector $\\mathbf{Q}$ such that for any point $\\mathbf{k}$ on the Fermi surface, the point $\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}$ is also on the Fermi surface.\n\nLet $\\mathbf{k}_{FS}$ be an arbitrary wavevector on the Fermi surface. By definition, $E(\\mathbf{k}_{FS}) = E_F = 0$. We can use the vector $\\mathbf{Q} = (\\pi/a, \\pi/a, \\pi/a)$ that we analyzed earlier. We need to check if the point $\\mathbf{k}_{FS}+\\mathbf{Q}$ also lies on the Fermi surface. The energy at this translated point is:\n$$E(\\mathbf{k}_{FS}+\\mathbf{Q}) = -E(\\mathbf{k}_{FS})$$\nSince $E(\\mathbf{k}_{FS}) = 0$, it follows that:\n$$E(\\mathbf{k}_{FS}+\\mathbf{Q}) = -0 = 0$$\nThis means that the point $\\mathbf{k}_{FS}+\\mathbf{Q}$ also has energy equal to the Fermi energy and thus lies on the Fermi surface. This property holds for any point $\\mathbf{k}_{FS}$ on the Fermi surface. Therefore, the Fermi surface is perfectly nested.\n\nThe primitive nesting wavevector is the vector $\\mathbf{Q}$ that maps the Fermi surface onto itself. We have identified such a vector:\n$$\\mathbf{Q} = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{a}, \\frac{\\pi}{a}, \\frac{\\pi}{a}\\right)$$\nThis vector lies within the specified first Brillouin zone, as its components are at the BZ boundary.\n\nFinally, we need to express the answer as the dimensionless tuple $(E_F/t, aQ_x, aQ_y, aQ_z)$.\n- The Fermi energy is $E_F=0$, so $E_F/t = 0$.\n- The components of the nesting vector are $Q_x = \\pi/a$, $Q_y = \\pi/a$, and $Q_z = \\pi/a$.\n- The dimensionless components are $aQ_x = \\pi$, $aQ_y = \\pi$, and $aQ_z = \\pi$.\n\nThe resulting tuple is $(0, \\pi, \\pi, \\pi)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0  \\pi  \\pi  \\pi\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2989116"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how a Fermi surface can exhibit nesting, we now explore its direct physical consequences.

It presents a standard scenario in condensed matter physics involving the effect of a Charge Density Wave (CDW) on the electronic band structure of a two-dimensional metal described by a tight-binding model. All necessary information is provided, and the problem is structured to be solved with standard theoretical tools.\n\nThe solution proceeds by following the four specified tasks.\n\n1.  Construction of the Reduced Brillouin Zone (RBZ)\n\nThe original square lattice has a lattice constant $a$. The primitive lattice vectors can be chosen as $\\mathbf{a}_1 = (a, 0)$ and $\\mathbf{a}_2 = (0, a)$. The corresponding reciprocal lattice vectors are $\\mathbf{G}_1 = (\\frac{2\\pi}{a}, 0)$ and $\\mathbf{G}_2 = (0, \\frac{2\\pi}{a})$. The first Brillouin zone is a square defined by $|k_x| \\le \\frac{\\pi}{a}$ and $|k_y| \\le \\frac{\\pi}{a}$.\n\nThe CDW with wavevector $\\mathbf{Q} = (\\frac{\\pi}{a}, 0)$ doubles the real-space periodicity along the $x$ direction. The new superlattice has primitive vectors $\\mathbf{a}'_1 = 2\\mathbf{a}_1 = (2a, 0)$ and $\\mathbf{a}'_2 = \\mathbf{a}_2 = (0, a)$.\n\nThe new reciprocal lattice vectors, $\\mathbf{G}'_1$ and $\\mathbf{G}'_2$, are determined by the condition $\\mathbf{a}'_i \\cdot \\mathbf{G}'_j = 2\\pi\\delta_{ij}$.\nFrom $\\mathbf{a}'_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{G}'_1 = 2\\pi$, we have $(2a) G'_{1x} + (0) G'_{1y} = 2\\pi$, which gives $G'_{1x} = \\frac{\\pi}{a}$.\nFrom $\\mathbf{a}'_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{G}'_1 = 0$, we have $(0) G'_{1x} + (a) G'_{1y} = 0$, which gives $G'_{1y} = 0$.\nThus, the first new reciprocal lattice vector is $\\mathbf{G}'_1 = (\\frac{\\pi}{a}, 0) = \\mathbf{Q}$.\n\nFrom $\\mathbf{a}'_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{G}'_2 = 0$, we have $(2a) G'_{2x} + (0) G'_{2y} = 0$, which gives $G'_{2x} = 0$.\nFrom $\\mathbf{a}'_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{G}'_2 = 2\\pi$, we have $(0) G'_{2x} + (a) G'_{2y} = 2\\pi$, which gives $G'_{2y} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}$.\nThus, the second new reciprocal lattice vector is $\\mathbf{G}'_2 = (0, \\frac{2\\pi}{a}) = \\mathbf{G}_2$.\n\nThe reduced Brillouin zone (RBZ) is the Wigner-Seitz cell of the new reciprocal lattice. It is bounded by the perpendicular bisectors of the vectors from the origin to the nearest new reciprocal lattice points. These points are $\\pm\\mathbf{G}'_1 = (\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{a}, 0)$ and $\\pm\\mathbf{G}'_2 = (0, \\pm\\frac{2\\pi}{a})$.\nThe boundaries are given by the planes $k_x = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}|\\mathbf{G}'_1| = \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2a}$ and $k_y = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}|\\mathbf{G}'_2| = \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{a}$.\nTherefore, the RBZ is a rectangle in $\\mathbf{k}$-space defined by the region $|k_x| \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2a}$ and $|k_y| \\le \\frac{\\pi}{a}$. The reduced-zone boundary along the $k_x$ direction is at $k_x = \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2a}$.\n\n2.  Derivation of the Hamiltonian and Eigenvalues\n\nThe total Hamiltonian is $H = H_0 + V$, where $H_0$ is the unperturbed tight-binding Hamiltonian and $V(\\mathbf{r})$ is the CDW potential. The eigenstates of $H_0$ are Bloch states $|\\mathbf{k}\\rangle$ with eigenvalues $\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} = -2t[\\cos(k_x a) + \\cos(k_y a)]$. The potential $V(\\mathbf{r})$ is periodic with the new lattice periodicity, so it can be expanded in a Fourier series over the new reciprocal lattice vectors $\\mathbf{G}'$. The dominant Fourier component is specified as $V_{\\mathbf{Q}}$. The potential is approximately $V(\\mathbf{r}) \\approx V_{\\mathbf{Q}} e^{i\\mathbf{Q}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}} + V_{\\mathbf{Q}}^* e^{-i\\mathbf{Q}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}$, since $V(\\mathbf{r})$ must be real.\n\nThis potential couples Bloch states $|\\mathbf{k}\\rangle$ and $|\\mathbf{k}'\\rangle$. A matrix element $\\langle\\mathbf{k}'|V|\\mathbf{k}\\rangle$ is non-zero only if $\\mathbf{k}'$ and $\\mathbf{k}$ differ by a new reciprocal lattice vector (modulo an original reciprocal lattice vector). The potential component $V_{\\mathbf{Q}}$ couples the state $|\\mathbf{k}\\rangle$ to the state $|\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}\\rangle$.\n\nWe construct the effective Hamiltonian in the nearly-degenerate basis $\\{|\\mathbf{k}\\rangle, |\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}\\rangle\\}$, where $\\mathbf{k}$ is restricted to the RBZ. The matrix elements of $H = H_0 + V$ are:\n$H_{11} = \\langle\\mathbf{k}|H_0+V|\\mathbf{k}\\rangle = \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} + \\langle\\mathbf{k}|V|\\mathbf{k}\\rangle$. The average potential $\\langle V \\rangle$ can be set to zero by a shift of the energy origin. So $H_{11} = \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}$.\n$H_{22} = \\langle\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}|H_0+V|\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}\\rangle = \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}}$.\n$H_{21} = \\langle\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}|H_0+V|\\mathbf{k}\\rangle = \\langle\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}|V|\\mathbf{k}\\rangle = V_{\\mathbf{Q}}$.\n$H_{12} = \\langle\\mathbf{k}|H_0+V|\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}\\rangle = \\langle\\mathbf{k}|V|\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}\\rangle = V_{-\\mathbf{Q}} = V_{\\mathbf{Q}}^*$.\n\nThe $2 \\times 2$ Hamiltonian matrix is:\n$$ H(\\mathbf{k}) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}  V_{\\mathbf{Q}}^* \\\\ V_{\\mathbf{Q}}  \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nTo find the eigenvalues, we first evaluate $\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}}$:\n$$ \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}} = -2t\\left[\\cos((k_x+\\frac{\\pi}{a})a) + \\cos(k_y a)\\right] = -2t\\left[\\cos(k_x a + \\pi) + \\cos(k_y a)\\right] $$\nUsing the identity $\\cos(\\theta+\\pi) = -\\cos(\\theta)$, we get:\n$$ \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}} = -2t\\left[-\\cos(k_x a) + \\cos(k_y a)\\right] $$\nThe eigenvalues $E_{\\pm}(\\mathbf{k})$ of the Hamiltonian matrix are given by the standard formula:\n$$ E_{\\pm}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} + \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}}}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} - \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}}}{2}\\right)^2 + |V_{\\mathbf{Q}}|^2} $$\nWe compute the sum and difference of the unperturbed energies:\n$$ \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} + \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}} = -2t(\\cos(k_x a)+\\cos(k_y a)) -2t(-\\cos(k_x a)+\\cos(k_y a)) = -4t\\cos(k_y a) $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} - \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}} = -2t(\\cos(k_x a)+\\cos(k_y a)) - (-2t(-\\cos(k_x a)+\\cos(k_y a))) = -4t\\cos(k_x a) $$\nSubstituting these expressions into the eigenvalue formula yields:\n$$ E_{\\pm}(\\mathbf{k}) = -2t\\cos(k_y a) \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{-4t\\cos(k_x a)}{2}\\right)^2 + |V_{\\mathbf{Q}}|^2} $$\n$$ E_{\\pm}(\\mathbf{k}) = -2t\\cos(k_y a) \\pm \\sqrt{4t^2\\cos^2(k_x a) + |V_{\\mathbf{Q}}|^2} $$\n\n3.  Energy Splitting at the RBZ Boundary\n\nThe energy splitting between the two new bands is $\\Delta E(\\mathbf{k}) = E_{+}(\\mathbf{k}) - E_{-}(\\mathbf{k})$. From the eigenvalue expression:\n$$ \\Delta E(\\mathbf{k}) = \\left(-2t\\cos(k_y a) + \\sqrt{\\dots}\\right) - \\left(-2t\\cos(k_y a) - \\sqrt{\\dots}\\right) = 2\\sqrt{4t^2\\cos^2(k_x a) + |V_{\\mathbf{Q}}|^2} $$\nThe problem asks for this splitting on the RBZ boundary. The boundary in the $k_x$ direction is at $k_x = \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2a}$. At these points, the argument of the cosine function is $k_x a = \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, so $\\cos(k_x a) = \\cos(\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 0$. Note that this is precisely the condition for degeneracy of the original bands, $\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} = \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}}$, which is necessary for a gap to open.\n\nEvaluating the splitting at the boundary $k_x = \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2a}$:\n$$ \\Delta E\\left(k_x = \\pm\\frac{\\pi}{2a}, k_y\\right) = 2\\sqrt{4t^2\\cos^2(\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{2}) + |V_{\\mathbf{Q}}|^2} = 2\\sqrt{4t^2(0)^2 + |V_{\\mathbf{Q}}|^2} $$\n$$ \\Delta E = 2\\sqrt{|V_{\\mathbf{Q}}|^2} = 2|V_{\\mathbf{Q}}| $$\nThe energy splitting at the RBZ boundary, which corresponds to the CDW gap, is constant along the boundary and equals $2|V_{\\mathbf{Q}}|$.\n\n4.  Numerical Calculation\n\nThe problem provides the values $t = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $|V_{\\mathbf{Q}}| = 0.06\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. The energy splitting at the boundary is $\\Delta E = 2|V_{\\mathbf{Q}}|$.

If $\\epsilon > 0$, $\\epsilon+q_z^2 > 0$ always, so $I'_{\\text{sing}}(\\epsilon)=0$.\nIf $\\epsilon  0$, the roots are $q_z = \\pm\\sqrt{-\\epsilon}$. Using the property $\\int dx \\delta(f(x)) = \\sum_i \\frac{1}{|f'(x_i)|}$ where $f(x_i)=0$:\n$$\nI'_{\\text{sing}}(\\epsilon) = \\pi \\left( \\frac{1}{|2q_z|_{q_z=\\sqrt{-\\epsilon}}} + \\frac{1}{|2q_z|_{q_z=-\\sqrt{-\\epsilon}}} \\right) = \\pi \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{-\\epsilon}} + \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{-\\epsilon}} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{-\\epsilon}}\n$$\nSo, $I'_{\\text{sing}}(\\epsilon) = \\pi \\frac{\\Theta(-\\epsilon)}{\\sqrt{-\\epsilon}}$.\nTo find the singular part of the DOS, we must find the singular part of $I(\\epsilon)$, which is obtained by integrating $I'_{\\text{sing}}(\\epsilon)$:\n$$\nI_{\\text{sing}}(\\epsilon) = \\int_{0}^{\\epsilon} I'_{\\text{sing}}(\\epsilon') d\\epsilon' = \\pi \\int_{0}^{\\epsilon} \\frac{\\Theta(-\\epsilon')}{\\sqrt{-\\epsilon'}} d\\epsilon'\n$$\nIf $\\epsilon > 0$, the integrand is zero over the entire path, so $I_{\\text{sing}}(\\epsilon) = 0$.\nIf $\\epsilon  0$, the integral becomes:\n$$\nI_{\\text{sing}}(\\epsilon) = \\pi \\int_{0}^{\\epsilon} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{-\\epsilon'}} d\\epsilon' = \\pi \\left[-2\\sqrt{-\\epsilon'}\\right]_{0}^{\\epsilon} = -2\\pi\\sqrt{-\\epsilon}\n$$\nCombining both cases using the Heaviside step function $\\Theta(x)$:\n$$\nI_{\\text{sing}}(\\epsilon) = -2\\pi \\sqrt{-\\epsilon} \\, \\Theta(-\\epsilon)\n$$\nNow, substituting this back into the expression for the DOS:\n$$\ng_{\\text{sing}}(\\epsilon) = C \\cdot I_{\\text{sing}}(\\epsilon) = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}(m_{x}m_{y}m_{z})^{1/2}}{(2\\pi)^{3}\\hbar^{3}} \\left(-2\\pi \\sqrt{-\\epsilon} \\, \\Theta(-\\epsilon)\\right)\n$$\n$$\ng_{\\text{sing}}(\\epsilon) = -\\frac{4\\pi\\sqrt{2}(m_{x}m_{y}m_{z})^{1/2}}{8\\pi^{3}\\hbar^{3}} \\sqrt{-\\epsilon} \\, \\Theta(-\\epsilon) = - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}(m_{x}m_{y}m_{z})^{1/2}}{2\\pi^{2}\\hbar^{3}} \\sqrt{-\\epsilon} \\, \\Theta(-\\epsilon)\n$$\nThis is the singular contribution to the DOS. It is non-zero and negative only for energies below the saddle point energy ($\\epsilon  0$).\n\nNext, we analyze the consequences for thermodynamic properties at low temperature $T$, where we can set the chemical potential $\\mu \\approx E_F$. The relevant quantity is the DOS at the chemical potential, $g(\\mu)$.\nThe singular part is $g_{\\text{sing}}(\\mu) = - A \\sqrt{E_c - \\mu} \\, \\Theta(E_c - \\mu)$, where $A=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}(m_{x}m_{y}m_{z})^{1/2}}{2\\pi^{2}\\hbar^{3}}$.\n\nThe electronic specific heat coefficient, $\\gamma$, from the Sommerfeld expansion is given by $\\gamma = \\frac{\\pi^2 k_B^2}{3} g(\\mu)$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. The singular contribution to $\\gamma$ is therefore directly proportional to $g_{\\text{sing}}(\\mu)$:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\text{sing}} = \\frac{\\pi^2 k_B^2}{3} g_{\\text{sing}}(\\mu) \\propto -\\sqrt{E_c - \\mu} \\, \\Theta(E_c - \\mu)\n$$\nThe Pauli spin susceptibility at $T=0$ is given by $\\chi_P = \\mu_B^2 g(\\mu)$, where $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton and $g(\\mu)$ is the DOS per spin at the chemical potential. The singular part of $\\chi_P$ is thus:\n$$\n\\chi_{P, \\text{sing}} = \\mu_B^2 g_{\\text{sing}}(\\mu) \\propto -\\sqrt{E_c - \\mu} \\, \\Theta(E_c - \\mu)\n$$\nBoth $\\gamma$ and $\\chi_P$ exhibit a singular dependence as the chemical potential $\\mu$ crosses the critical energy $E_c$. The non-analyticity is *one-sided*: it only appears for $\\mu  E_c$. As $\\mu$ approaches $E_c$ from below ($\\mu \\to E_c^-$), both $\\gamma(\\mu)$ and $\\chi_P(\\mu)$ approach their values at $E_c$ (determined by the regular part of the DOS) with a divergent slope, since $\\frac{d}{d\\mu} \\sqrt{E_c - \\mu} \\propto (E_c - \\mu)^{-1/2}$. For $\\mu > E_c$, this singular term vanishes, and the derivatives of $\\gamma$ and $\\chi_P$ are finite (determined by the regular background DOS). This one-sided cusp is a characteristic signature of a Lifshitz transition involving a saddle point. The origin of this one-sidedness lies mathematically in the domain of integration for the phase space volume, which changes its constraints at $\\epsilon = 0$, leading to a square-root singularity that manifests only on the side of the transition where the constant energy surface consists of two separate sheets ($\\epsilon  0$, a two-sheet hyperboloid).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{- \\frac{\\sqrt{2} (m_{x} m_{y} m_{z})^{1/2}}{2\\pi^{2} \\hbar^{3}} \\sqrt{-\\epsilon} \\Theta(-\\epsilon)}\n$$", "id": "2989126"}]}
