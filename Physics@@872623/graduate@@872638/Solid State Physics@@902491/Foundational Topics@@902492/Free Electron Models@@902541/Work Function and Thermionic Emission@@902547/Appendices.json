The Effective Potential Barrier and Schottky Lowering\n\nAn electron of charge $\\,-e\\,$ at a distance $\\,x>0\\,$ from a planar metal surface at $\\,x=0\\,$ experiences two forces in the one-dimensional model: an attractive force from its own image charge within the conductor and a force from an externally applied electric field, $\\,E_s\\,$, at the surface. We define $\\,E_s>0\\,$ for a field that accelerates electrons away from the surface.\n\nThe image charge, of magnitude $\\,+e\\,$, is located at $\\,-x\\,$. The force on the electron due to this image charge is given by Coulomb's law:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{im}}(x) = -\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{e^2}{(2x)^2} = -\\frac{e^2}{16\\pi\\epsilon_0 x^2}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates an attractive force (towards the surface at $\\,x=0\\,$). The potential energy associated with this force, setting the reference $\\,U_{\\mathrm{im}}(\\infty)=0\\,$, is:\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{im}}(x) = -\\int_\\infty^x F_{\\mathrm{im}}(x') dx' = \\int_x^\\infty F_{\\mathrm{im}}(x') dx' = \\int_x^\\infty \\left(-\\frac{e^2}{16\\pi\\epsilon_0 (x')^2}\\right) dx' = -\\frac{e^2}{16\\pi\\epsilon_0 x}\n$$\nThe external field $\\,E_s\\,$ exerts a force $\\,F_{\\mathrm{ext}} = -e E_s\\,$. The potential energy associated with this field, relative to the surface at $\\,x=0\\,$, is:\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{ext}}(x) = -F_{\\mathrm{ext}} \\cdot x = e E_s x\n$$\nThe problem statement defines the potential energy relative to the Fermi level, which is $\\,\\Phi_0\\,$ below the vacuum level in the absence of fields. The total potential energy barrier, $\\,W(x)\\,$, for an electron at distance $\\,x\\,$ is the sum of the work function and these two potential energy contributions:\n$$\nW(x) = \\Phi_0 + U_{\\mathrm{im}}(x) - U_{\\mathrm{ext}}(x) = \\Phi_0 - \\frac{e^2}{16\\pi\\epsilon_0 x} - e E_s x\n$$\nNote that the potential energy due to the field $\\,E_s\\,$ is negative for an escaping electron, hence it lowers the barrier. The electron potential energy is $\\,U(x)=-e\\phi(x)\\,$, and the electric field is $\\,E = -\\nabla \\phi\\,$. The total potential, relative to the metal's potential, is $\\,\\phi(x) = \\frac{e}{16\\pi\\epsilon_0 x} + E_s x\\,$.

To express this in electronvolts (eV), we divide by the elementary charge $\\,e\\,$:\n$$\n\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}[\\mathrm{eV}] = \\Phi_0[\\mathrm{eV}] - \\frac{1}{e}\\sqrt{\\frac{e^3 E_s}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}} = \\Phi_0[\\mathrm{eV}] - \\sqrt{\\frac{e E_s}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}}\n$$\nThe final barrier is clamped at zero, so $\\,\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\max\\{0, \\Phi_0 - \\Delta \\Phi_{\\mathrm{im}}(E_s)\\}\\,$.\n\n### 2.

Let's measure energies relative to the Fermi Level, so we require $\\,p_x^2/(2m_e) > \\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\,$.\n\nThe current density $\\,J_{\\mathrm{em}}\\,$ is:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{em}} = \\int e v_x dn = \\frac{2e}{h^3} \\int_{p_{x,\\min}}^\\infty dp_x \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dp_y \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dp_z \\left(\\frac{p_x}{m_e}\\right) e^{-( (p_x^2+p_y^2+p_z^2)/(2m_e) ) / (k_B T)}\n$$\nHere, we have set $\\,E_F=0\\,$ for simplicity. The lower limit of integration for $\\,p_x\\,$ is $\\,p_{x,\\min} = \\sqrt{2m_e \\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\\,$. The integrals over $\\,p_y\\,$ and $\\,p_z\\,$ are standard Gaussian integrals: $\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-ap^2}dp = \\sqrt{\\pi/a}\\,$. Here $\\,a=1/(2m_e k_B T)\\,$, so each integral evaluates to $\\,\\sqrt{2\\pi m_e k_B T}\\,$.\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{em}} = \\frac{2e}{h^3} (2\\pi m_e k_B T) \\int_{\\sqrt{2m_e \\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}}}^\\infty \\frac{p_x}{m_e} e^{-p_x^2/(2m_e k_B T)} dp_x\n$$\nTo solve the $\\,p_x\\,$ integral, let $\\,u = p_x^2/(2m_e k_B T)\\,$. Then $\\,du = (p_x / (m_e k_B T)) dp_x\\,$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}/(k_B T)}^\\infty (k_B T) e^{-u} du = k_B T [-e^{-u}]_{\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}/(k_B T)}^\\infty = k_B T e^{-\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}/(k_B T)}\n$$\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{em}} = \\frac{2e}{h^3} (2\\pi m_e k_B T) (k_B T e^{-\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}/(k_B T)}) = \\left(\\frac{4\\pi m_e e k_B^2}{h^3}\\right) T^2 e^{-\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}/(k_B T)}\n$$\nThis is the Richardson-Dushman equation, $\\,J_{\\mathrm{em}} = A_R T^2 e^{-\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}/(k_B T)}\\,$, where the Richardson constant $\\,A_R\\,$ is identified as:\n$$\nA_R = \\frac{4\\pi m_e e k_B^2}{h^3} \\approx 1.2017 \\times 10^6 \\, \\mathrm{A\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-2}}\n$$\nIn this formula, the work function $\\,\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\,$ must be in Joules.\n\n### 3. Space-Charge-Limited Current Density\n\nWhen emission is strong, the charge of the emitted electrons in the gap between the cathode ($\\,x=0\\,$) and anode ($\\,x=d\\,$) can become significant. This \"space charge\" creates its own electric field that opposes further emission. The maximum current that can be sustained by a potential difference $\\,V\\,$ across the gap is known as the space-charge-limited current, given by the Child-Langmuir law.\n\nWe derive it from the 1D Poisson equation and energy conservation, assuming electrons are emitted with zero initial velocity.\nPoisson's equation: $\\,\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\epsilon_0}\\,$.\nEnergy conservation: $\\,\\frac{1}{2}m_e v(x)^2 = e \\phi(x)\\,$, giving $\\,v(x) = \\sqrt{2e\\phi(x)/m_e}\\,$.\nCurrent continuity: $\\,J = |\\rho(x)| v(x)\\,$, so $\\,|\\rho(x)| = J/v(x) = J \\sqrt{m_e/(2e\\phi(x))}\\,$.\nSubstituting into Poisson's equation ($\\rho = -|\\rho|$):\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} = \\frac{J}{\\epsilon_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_e}{2e}} \\phi^{-1/2}\n$$\nWe solve this ODE with boundary conditions $\\,\\phi(0)=0\\,$ and $\\,\\phi(d)=V\\,$. The space-charge-limited condition implies the electric field at the cathode vanishes due to the charge cloud: $\\,E(0) = -(d\\phi/dx)|_{x=0} = 0\\,$. Integrating the ODE once gives $\\,(d\\phi/dx)^2 = 4(J/\\epsilon_0)\\sqrt{m_e/(2e)} \\phi^{1/2}\\,$. A second integration yields $\\,\\frac{4}{3}\\phi^{3/4} = 2\\sqrt{J/\\epsilon_0} (m_e/(2e))^{1/4} x\\,$. Applying the anode boundary condition $\\,\\phi(d)=V\\,$ and solving for the current density $\\,J_{CL}\\,$ gives:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{CL}} = \\frac{4\\epsilon_0}{9} \\sqrt{\\frac{2e}{m_e}} \\frac{V^{3/2}}{d^2}\n$$\nUsing the relation $\\,V = E_{\\mathrm{ext}}d\\,$, we can express $\\,J_{\\mathrm{CL}}\\,$ in terms of the external field:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{CL}}(E_{\\mathrm{ext}}, d) = \\frac{4\\epsilon_0}{9} \\sqrt{\\frac{2e}{m_e}} E_{\\mathrm{ext}}^{3/2} d^{-1/2}\n$$\nThis expression is valid for $\\,E_{\\mathrm{ext}} > 0\\,$ (and hence $\\,V>0\\,$). If $\\,E_{\\mathrm{ext}} \\le 0\\,$, no current can be drawn, so $\\,J_{\\mathrm{CL}}=0\\,$.\n\n### 4. Self-Consistent Model\n\nThe final step is to combine these effects. The current that the cathode *can* emit, $\\,J_{\\mathrm{em}}\\,$, depends on the surface field $\\,E_s\\,$ through the Schottky effect. The current the gap *can* sustain, $\\,J_{\\mathrm{CL}}\\,$, depends on the external field $\\,E_{\\mathrm{ext}}\\,$ and gap distance $\\,d\\,$. The core of the model is enforcing consistency.\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n1.  Assume the flow is *supply-limited*. This means space charge is negligible and the field at the surface is simply the externally applied field, $\\,E_s = E_{\\mathrm{ext}}\\,$.\n2.  Calculate a provisional effective work function $\\,\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff, prov}}\\,$ using this surface field $\\,E_s=E_{\\mathrm{ext}}\\,$ in the Schottky formula.\n3.  Calculate the corresponding thermionic emission current, $\\,J_{\\mathrm{em}}(T, \\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff, prov}})\\,$.\n4.  Calculate the maximum sustainable current density, $\\,J_{\\mathrm{CL}}(V, d)\\,$, where $\\,V=E_{\\mathrm{ext}}d\\,$.\n5.  Compare $\\,J_{\\mathrm{em}}\\,$ and $\\,J_{\\mathrm{CL}}\\,$:\n    -   If $\\,J_{\\mathrm{em}} \\le J_{\\mathrm{CL}}\\,$: The assumption was correct. The cathode is the bottleneck, and the effective barrier is indeed lowered by the external field. The final effective work function is $\\,\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff, prov}}\\,$.\n    -   If $\\,J_{\\mathrm{em}} > J_{\\mathrm{CL}}\\,$: The assumption was incorrect. The cathode *tries* to emit more current than the gap can transport. Space charge builds up and suppresses the field at the cathode. In this *space-charge-limited* regime, the model approximates the surface field as being completely quenched, $\\,E_s = 0\\,$. With zero surface field, there is no Schottky lowering, so the effective barrier is simply the bare work function, $\\,\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\Phi_0\\,$.\n\nThis logic provides a deterministic way to find the self-consistent effective emission barrier for each set of parameters. All energies are treated in Joules for calculations and converted to electronvolts for the final output. The final value is clamped at or above zero.", "answer": "[4.446362,4.446362,4.446362,4.500000,4.225219]", "id": "2985290"}]}
