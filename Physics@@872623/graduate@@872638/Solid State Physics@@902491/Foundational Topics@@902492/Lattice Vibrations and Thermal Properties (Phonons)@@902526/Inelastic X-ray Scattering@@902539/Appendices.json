For crystals with a basis of two or more atoms per unit cell, the phonon dispersion relation exhibits both acoustic and optical branches. The frequency of these phonons can be measured with high precision using inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS).\n\nConsider a simplified one-dimensional model of a diatomic crystal, such as Boron Nitride (BN). The crystal is represented as a linear chain of alternating atoms with masses $M_1$ and $M_2$, connected by identical springs with a force constant $C$. The equilibrium distance between any two adjacent atoms is $d$.\n\nThe frequency of the optical phonon branch at the Brillouin zone center (wavevector $q=0$), denoted as $\\omega_{opt}$, is particularly important as it is often accessible to spectroscopic techniques.\n\nSuppose the crystal is initially composed of atoms with masses $M_1$ and $M_2$. Then, an isotopic substitution is performed, replacing all atoms of mass $M_1$ with their isotope of mass $M_1'$. The mass $M_2$ and the interatomic force constant $C$ are assumed to be unaffected by this substitution. This change in mass leads to a new zone-center optical phonon frequency, $\\omega'_{opt}$.\n\nCalculate the relative frequency shift, defined as $\\frac{\\omega'_{opt} - \\omega_{opt}}{\\omega_{opt}}$.
