The electronic state of a multi-electron ion is often summarized by a term symbol of the form $^{2S+1}L_J$. In this notation, $S$ is the total spin angular momentum quantum number, $L$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and $J$ is the total angular momentum quantum number. For a given total angular momentum quantum number $L$, the spectroscopic notation uses letters: S, P, D, F, G, H, I, K, ... for $L=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ...$ respectively.\n\nThe ground state term symbol for an ion with a partially filled electron subshell is determined by applying Hund's Rules in sequence:\n1.  **Rule 1 (Maximum Spin):** The electron configuration in the orbitals is the one that maximizes the total spin quantum number, $S = |\\sum m_s|$.\n2.  **Rule 2 (Maximum Orbital Angular Momentum):** For the value of $S$ determined from Rule 1, the configuration is the one that maximizes the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, $L = |\\sum m_l|$.\n3.  **Rule 3 (Total Angular Momentum):** The total angular momentum quantum number $J$ is determined by the values of $L$ and $S$.\n    -   If the subshell is less than half-full, $J = |L - S|$.\n    -   If the subshell is more than half-full, $J = L + S$.\n    -   If the subshell is exactly half-full, $L=0$ and thus $J = S$.\n\nConsider a free Holmium ion, $\\text{Ho}^{3+}$, which has an outer electron configuration of $4f^{10}$.

With 10 electrons in a 14-electron subshell, there are 4 unpaired electrons. Each unpaired electron contributes $m_s = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}$, and when all unpaired electrons have parallel spins, the maximum spin projection is $M_S = \\sum m_s = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 2$.

The unpaired electrons (4 in number) are placed in different orbitals to maximize the total orbital angular momentum projection $M_L = \\sum m_l$. The paired electrons (6 electrons forming 3 pairs) contribute $M_L = 0$ per pair. To maximize $M_L$, the unpaired electrons occupy the orbitals with the highest $m_l$ values: $m_l = 3, 2, 1, 0$.
