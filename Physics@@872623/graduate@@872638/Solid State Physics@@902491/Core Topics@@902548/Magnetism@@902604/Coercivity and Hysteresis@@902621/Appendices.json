We will calculate each quantity separately and then multiply them.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Remanence-to-Saturation Ratio ($R$)**\n\nLet the initial saturating field $\\vec{H}$ be applied along the $z$-axis. When this strong field is applied, the magnetization vector $\\vec{M}$ of every particle aligns with $\\vec{H}$. Thus, the initial state for all particles is $\\vec{M} = M_s \\hat{z}$.\n\nWhen the external field is reduced to zero, the only energy term is the anisotropy energy, $u_A = K\\sin^2\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between $\\vec{M}$ and the particle's easy axis. This energy is minimized when $\\vec{M}$ is aligned with the easy axis ($\\theta=0$ or $\\theta=\\pi$). Each particle's magnetization will relax to one of these two minimum energy states. The system will choose the state that is closest to the initial, saturated-state magnetization direction ($\\hat{z}$).\n\nLet the easy axis of a particular particle be described by a unit vector $\\hat{n}$, which makes a polar angle $\\alpha$ with the $z$-axis. The two energy minima correspond to $\\vec{M} = M_s \\hat{n}$ and $\\vec{M} = -M_s \\hat{n}$. The particle's magnetization will relax to the direction that has a positive projection on the $z$-axis.\nThis means the final magnetization vector $\\vec{M}_r$ will point along the direction of the easy axis that lies in the upper hemisphere (i.e., its $z$-component is positive).\n\nFor a particle whose easy axis is at an angle $\\alpha$ to the $z$-axis, its contribution to the net remanent magnetization along the $z$-axis, $M_z$, is $M_s \\cos(\\psi)$, where $\\psi$ is the angle of the final magnetization with the $z$-axis.\n- If the easy axis is in the upper hemisphere, $\\alpha \\in [0, \\pi/2]$, the magnetization aligns with it, so $\\psi=\\alpha$. The contribution is $M_z = M_s \\cos\\alpha$.\n- If the easy axis is in the lower hemisphere, $\\alpha \\in [\\pi/2, \\pi]$, the magnetization aligns with the opposite direction $-\\hat{n}$ to have a positive $z$-component.
