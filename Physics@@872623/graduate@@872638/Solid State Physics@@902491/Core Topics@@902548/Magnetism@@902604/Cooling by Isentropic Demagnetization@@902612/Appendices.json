The salt contains a large number, $N$, of non-interacting magnetic ions, each with total angular momentum quantum number $J$. The total entropy of the salt, $S$, is the sum of the lattice entropy, $S_L$, and the magnetic entropy, $S_m$.\n\nIn a certain low-temperature regime, the lattice heat capacity is well described by $C_L = aT^3$, where $a$ is a constant.
