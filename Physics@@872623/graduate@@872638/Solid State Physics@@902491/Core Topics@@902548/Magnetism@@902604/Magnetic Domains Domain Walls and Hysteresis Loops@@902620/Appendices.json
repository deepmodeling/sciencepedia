The mechanism that requires a smaller applied magnetic field will dominate. This problem explores the competition between these two modes in a system with both shape and magnetocrystalline anisotropy.\n\nConsider an infinitely long cylinder of radius $b$ composed of a ferromagnetic material with saturation magnetization $M_s$, exchange stiffness constant $A$, and a uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant $K_u > 0$.
