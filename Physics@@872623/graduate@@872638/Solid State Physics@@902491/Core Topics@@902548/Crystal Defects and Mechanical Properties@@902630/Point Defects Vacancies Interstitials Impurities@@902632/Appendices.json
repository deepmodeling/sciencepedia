This substitution creates a fixed concentration of singly-charged acceptor point defects, $M_A'$, with a site fraction concentration given by $[M_A'] = x$.\n\nAt high temperatures, the oxide equilibrates with the surrounding oxygen atmosphere, establishing a population of point defects. The defect chemistry can be described by two key equilibrium reactions:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Incorporation:** The reaction governing the exchange of oxygen between the lattice and the ambient gas, which involves oxygen vacancies ($V_O^{\\bullet\\bullet}$) and electronic holes ($h^\\bullet$).\n    $$ \\frac{1}{2}O_2(g) + V_O^{\\bullet\\bullet} \\rightleftharpoons O_O^\\times + 2h^\\bullet $$\n    The mass action law for this reaction is given by a temperature-dependent equilibrium constant $K_{ox}$, where the concentration of oxygen on its regular site, $[O_O^\\times]$, is assumed to be constant and is absorbed into the value of $K_{ox}$:\n    $$ K_{ox} = \\frac{[h^\\bullet]^2}{[V_O^{\\bullet\\bullet}] P_{O_2}^{1/2}} $$\n\n2.  **Intrinsic Electronic Excitation:** The thermal generation of electron-hole pairs.\n    $$ nil \\rightleftharpoons e' + h^\\bullet $$\n    The corresponding mass action law defines the intrinsic carrier product, $K_i$:\n    $$ K_i = [e'][h^\\bullet] $$\n\nThe overall charge neutrality within the crystal is maintained according to the relation:\n$$ [h^\\bullet] + 2[V_O^{\\bullet\\bullet}] = [e'] + [M_A'] $$\n\nThe compensation for the negative charge of the acceptors can be dominated either by ionic carriers ($V_O^{\\bullet\\bullet}$) at low oxygen partial pressures ($P_{O_2}$) or by electronic carriers ($h^\\bullet$) at high $P_{O_2}$.

This exercise [@problem_id:186599] models the process of Frenkel pair annihilation as a diffusion-limited reaction. By solving the corresponding rate equation, you will develop a quantitative understanding of how defect populations evolve over time.", "problem": "Consider a crystalline solid initially at a very low temperature. At time $t=0$, the crystal is subjected to a process (e.g., high-energy particle irradiation) that creates a uniform, non-equilibrium concentration $C_0$ of Frenkel defects. A Frenkel defect consists of a vacancy and a nearby self-interstitial atom. For simplicity, we assume that the process creates an equal number of vacancies and interstitials, so their concentrations are always equal: $C_V(t) = C_I(t) = C(t)$.\n\nImmediately after their creation, the crystal's temperature is raised to and maintained at a temperature $T$. At this temperature, the interstitials are mobile with a diffusion coefficient $D$, while the vacancies are considered immobile. The thermal generation of new Frenkel pairs at temperature $T$ is negligible.\n\nThe mobile interstitials diffuse through the lattice. If an interstitial comes within a certain capture radius $r_c$ of a vacancy, the two defects annihilate each other, restoring a perfect lattice site. This annihilation process is diffusion-limited, meaning the overall reaction rate is determined by the rate at which interstitials can diffuse to vacancies.\n\nAssuming the annihilation is a second-order kinetic process, derive an expression for the concentration of Frenkel defects, $C(t)$, as a function of time $t > 0$. Your expression should be in terms of the initial concentration $C_0$, the interstitial diffusion coefficient $D$, and the capture radius $r_c$.", "solution": "The annihilation of Frenkel defects is a diffusion-limited second-order process. Given that vacancies are immobile and interstitials are mobile with diffusion coefficient $D$, the rate of annihilation is governed by the diffusion of interstitials to vacancies. The concentration of vacancies $C_V(t)$ and interstitials $C_I(t)$ are always equal, denoted as $C(t)$.\n\nIn a mean-field approximation, the rate constant for the diffusion-limited reaction is derived from the steady-state solution of the diffusion equation around a single vacancy. For a spherical capture radius $r_c$, the rate at which interstitials are absorbed by one vacancy is $4\\pi D r_c C(t)$.
