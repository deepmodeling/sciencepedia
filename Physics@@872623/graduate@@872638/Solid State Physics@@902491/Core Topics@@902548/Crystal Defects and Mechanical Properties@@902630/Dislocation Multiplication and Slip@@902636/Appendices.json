A dislocation source can generate new dislocations under applied stress, enabling significant plastic strain.\n\nConsider a model for a dislocation source where a single edge dislocation segment is constrained between an impenetrable grain boundary and a free surface. The slip plane of the dislocation is oriented perpendicular to both the grain boundary and the free surface. Let the distance between the grain boundary and the free surface be $L$.\n\nWe can describe the dislocation line's shape within its slip plane using a coordinate system $(x,z)$. The grain boundary lies on the line $z=0$ and the free surface on the line $z=L$. The dislocation segment is initially a straight line along the z-axis. One end is pinned at the origin $(0,0)$ on the grain boundary. When a shear stress $\\tau$ is applied in the slip direction (the x-direction), the dislocation line bows out into the region $x>0$.\n\nThe dislocation line has a line tension $T$ (energy per unit length). The force per unit length exerted by the shear stress on the dislocation is given by $F/l = \\tau b$, where $b$ is the magnitude of the Burgers vector. This force acts perpendicular to the dislocation line, within the slip plane. The equilibrium shape of the dislocation is determined by the balance between the applied stress and the line tension.\n\nThe boundary conditions for the dislocation line shape, represented by the curve $x(z)$, are as follows:\n1. The dislocation is pinned at the grain boundary: $x(0) = 0$.\n2. The dislocation line must meet the free surface perpendicularly. This means the tangent to the curve $x(z)$ at $z=L$ must be parallel to the z-axis.\n\nAs the applied stress $\\tau$ increases, the dislocation bows out more. Above a certain critical stress, $\\tau_c$, no stable equilibrium shape for the dislocation exists, and the source activates by emitting a dislocation loop.\n\nDerive the expression for this critical shear stress, $\\tau_c$, in terms of the dislocation line tension $T$, the Burgers vector magnitude $b$, and the separation distance $L$.", "solution": "The problem is to find the critical shear stress $\\tau_c$ for a dislocation source pinned between a grain boundary and a free surface.\n\nThe equilibrium shape of the dislocation line is determined by the balance between the outward force per unit length from the applied shear stress, $\\tau b$, and the inward force per unit length from the line tension, $T/R$, where $R$ is the local radius of curvature.\n$$\n\\tau b = \\frac{T}{R}\n$$\nThis equation implies that for a uniform applied stress $\\tau$, the dislocation line will form an arc of a circle with a constant radius $R = T/(\\tau b)$.\n\nLet the equation of this circular arc in the $(x,z)$ plane be:\n$$\n(x - x_c)^2 + (z - z_c)^2 = R^2\n$$\nwhere $(x_c, z_c)$ is the center of the circle and $R$ is its radius.\n\nWe must now apply the boundary conditions to determine the parameters of the circle.\n\n1.  **Boundary condition at the free surface ($z=L$):**\n    The dislocation line must be perpendicular to the free surface. In our coordinate system, this means the tangent to the curve $x(z)$ at $z=L$ must be parallel to the z-axis. The tangent vector is proportional to $(x'(z), 1)$. For it to be parallel to the z-axis (the vector $(0,1)$), its x-component must be zero. So, $x'(L) = 0$.\n\n    To find the slope, we can implicitly differentiate the circle equation with respect to $z$:\n    $$\n    2(x - x_c)x' + 2(z - z_c) = 0\n    $$\n    $$\n    x'(z) = -\\frac{z - z_c}{x - x_c}\n    $$\n    The condition $x'(L) = 0$ implies that the numerator must be zero at $z=L$:\n    $$\n    L - z_c = 0 \\implies z_c = L\n    $$\n    This means the center of the circular arc must lie on the line $z=L$.\n\n2.  **Boundary condition at the grain boundary ($z=0$):**\n    The dislocation is pinned at the origin, so the curve must pass through the point $(0,0)$.\n    $$\n    x(0) = 0\n    $$\n    Substituting this point and $z_c = L$ into the circle equation:\n    $$\n    (0 - x_c)^2 + (0 - L)^2 = R^2\n    $$\n    $$\n    x_c^2 + L^2 = R^2\n    $$\n    Since the dislocation bows out into the region $x>0$, the center of curvature $x_c$ must be positive. We solve for $x_c$:\n    $$\n    x_c = \\sqrt{R^2 - L^2}\n    $$\n\nFor a real solution for $x_c$ to exist, the term under the square root must be non-negative:\n$$\nR^2 - L^2 \\ge 0 \\implies R \\ge L\n$$\nThis condition places a lower bound on the radius of curvature $R$ for which a stable equilibrium configuration of the dislocation line is possible.\n\nThe applied stress $\\tau$ is related to the radius of curvature by $\\tau = T/(bR)$. To increase the stress, the radius of curvature $R$ must decrease. The maximum possible stress for a stable equilibrium corresponds to the minimum possible radius, $R_{min}$. From the condition derived above, the minimum radius is:\n$$\nR_{min} = L\n$$\nIf the stress is increased further such that $R$ would need to be less than $L$, no stable solution exists, and the dislocation becomes unstable, leading to the operation of the source.

This exercise [@problem_id:73650] illustrates how to bridge the gap from microscopic defect interactions to macroscopic mechanical properties, a central challenge in materials science.", "problem": "The athermal flow stress in crystalline solids containing a high concentration of solute atoms is often controlled by the interaction of dislocations with these solute atoms, which act as pinning obstacles. This phenomenon is known as solid solution strengthening. In the regime of strong, concentrated obstacles, the motion of a dislocation cannot be described by its thermally activated breakaway from individual pinning points. Instead, it moves as a flexible line through a random potential landscape created by the obstacles. This is the domain of Mott-Labusch statistics.\n\nConsider an edge dislocation, modeled as an elastic string with a constant line tension $\\Gamma$, moving on its slip plane. The magnitude of its Burgers vector is $b$. The slip plane contains a random, two-dimensional distribution of strong point obstacles with a uniform area density $n_A$. Each obstacle can exert a maximum pinning force $F_m$ on the dislocation, and the interaction is short-ranged with an effective range of $w$.\n\nThe athermal critical resolved shear stress, $\\tau_c$, corresponds to the stress required to cause large-scale motion of the dislocation through the obstacle field at zero temperature. We can derive this stress using a scaling argument that balances the Peach-Koehler driving force against the statistical pinning force of the obstacle field.\n\nThe physical model is based on the following key ideas:\n1.  The dislocation line is considered to be composed of segments of a characteristic length, $L$. This length represents the scale over which the dislocation line maintains its coherence.\n2.  The effective statistical pinning force, $F_{rand}$, on a segment of length $L$ arises from the root-mean-square fluctuation in the sum of forces from individual obstacles. The number of relevant obstacles is estimated by the number contained within the area swept by the segment, which is $L \\times w$. Assume the characteristic force per obstacle contributing to this fluctuation is $F_m$.\n3.  The dislocation's line tension, $\\Gamma$, provides a restoring force, $F_{restore}$, that resists bending. For a segment of length $L$ deflected by a characteristic distance $w$, this force is given by $F_{restore} = C_1 \\Gamma \\frac{w}{L}$, where $C_1$ is a dimensionless geometric constant of order unity.\n4.  The characteristic length $L$ is determined by the condition that the line tension's restoring force balances the statistical pinning force from the obstacles, i.e., $F_{restore} = F_{rand}$.\n5.  The critical shear stress $\\tau_c$ is achieved when the Peach-Koehler driving force on a segment of length $L$ is sufficient to overcome the statistical pinning force. This balance is expressed as $\\tau_c b L = C_2 F_{rand}$, where $C_2$ is another dimensionless constant of order unity.\n\nUsing this physical model and the associated scaling arguments, derive an expression for the athermal flow stress $\\tau_c$ in terms of the physical parameters $\\Gamma$, $b$, $n_A$, $F_m$, $w$, and the dimensionless constants $C_1$ and $C_2$.", "solution": "1.
