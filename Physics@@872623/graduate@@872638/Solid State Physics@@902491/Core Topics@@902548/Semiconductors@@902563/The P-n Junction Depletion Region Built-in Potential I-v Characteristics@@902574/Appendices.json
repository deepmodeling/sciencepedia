{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The space-charge region in a p-n junction, composed of separated layers of fixed positive and negative ions, acts much like a parallel-plate capacitor. However, unlike a simple capacitor, the 'plate separation'—the depletion width—is not fixed; it changes with the applied voltage. This exercise guides you through the fundamental derivation of this junction capacitance, a key parameter that governs the high-frequency response of reverse-biased diodes and forms the basis of voltage-variable capacitors (varactors).

The p-side is heavily doped with an acceptor concentration $N_A$, and the n-side is lightly doped with a donor concentration $N_D$, such that it forms a p⁺-n junction where $N_A \\gg N_D$. The junction is formed from a semiconductor material with a static dielectric permittivity of $\\epsilon_s$. The elementary charge is denoted by $q$.\n\nDue to the diffusion of charge carriers, a depletion region (or space-charge region) is formed around the metallurgical junction at $x=0$. This region is depleted of free carriers and contains fixed, ionized dopant atoms. We will work within the *depletion approximation*, which assumes that the charge density in the depletion region is solely due to these ionized dopants and is zero elsewhere.\n\nUnder thermal equilibrium, a built-in potential, $V_{bi}$, is established across this region. When an external reverse bias voltage, $V_R > 0$, is applied across the junction (positive terminal to the n-side), the total potential drop across the depletion region increases and the width of the region expands.\n\nBecause the depletion region consists of separated layers of positive charge (on the n-side) and negative charge (on the p-side), it behaves like a capacitor. Your task is to calculate the junction capacitance per unit area, $C_j'$, for this p⁺-n junction under the reverse bias $V_R$.
