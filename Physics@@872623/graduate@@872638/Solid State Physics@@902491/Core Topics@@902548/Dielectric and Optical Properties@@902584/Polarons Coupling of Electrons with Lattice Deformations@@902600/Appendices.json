We are asked to find the polaron binding energy in the atomic limit, where the electron hopping is negligible and the electron is pinned to a single site.\n\nFirst, we establish the relevant Hamiltonian based on the problem's constraints. The full Hamiltonian is given as:\n$$\nH \\;=\\; -t \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} \\left( c_{i}^{\\dagger} c_{j} + c_{j}^{\\dagger} c_{i} \\right) \\;+\\; \\omega_{0} \\sum_{i} b_{i}^{\\dagger} b_{i} \\;+\\; g \\sum_{i} n_{i} \\left( b_{i} + b_{i}^{\\dagger} \\right)\n$$\nWe are instructed to ignore the hopping term, which corresponds to setting the hopping parameter $t=0$. Furthermore, a single electron is pinned at a specific site $j$. This implies that the electron number operator $n_{i} = c_{i}^{\\dagger} c_{i}$ has the eigenvalue $1$ for site $i=j$ and $0$ for all other sites, i.e., $n_{j}=1$ and $n_{i \\neq j}=0$.\n\nUnder these conditions, the Hamiltonian simplifies significantly. The hopping term vanishes. The electron-phonon interaction term $g \\sum_{i} n_{i} (b_{i} + b_{i}^{\\dagger})$ becomes $g n_{j} (b_{j} + b_{j}^{\\dagger}) = g (1) (b_{j} + b_{j}^{\\dagger})$. The phonons on sites $i \\neq j$ are completely decoupled from the electron and from the phonon at site $j$. Their Hamiltonian is simply $\\omega_{0} \\sum_{i \\neq j} b_{i}^{\\dagger} b_{i}$. The ground state of these decoupled phonons has zero energy. Therefore, to find the energy lowering due to the interaction, we only need to consider the part of the Hamiltonian involving site $j$:\n$$\nH_{j} \\;=\\; \\omega_{0} b_{j}^{\\dagger} b_{j} \\;+\\; g \\left( b_{j} + b_{j}^{\\dagger} \\right)\n$$\nThis Hamiltonian describes a quantum harmonic oscillator perturbed by a term linear in the creation and annihilation operators, which represents the force exerted by the electron on the lattice at site $j$.\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we apply a unitary displacement transformation, also known as a Lang-Firsov transformation, to diagonalize the Hamiltonian. Let the unitary operator be $U = \\exp(S)$, where $S$ is an anti-Hermitian operator. We choose $S = \\lambda (b_{j}^{\\dagger} - b_{j})$ where $\\lambda$ is a real constant to be determined. The transformed Hamiltonian is $\\tilde{H}_{j} = U H_{j} U^{\\dagger}$. To calculate this, we first find how the operators $b_{j}$ and $b_{j}^{\\dagger}$ transform:\n$$\n\\tilde{b}_{j} = U b_{j} U^{\\dagger} = e^S b_j e^{-S}\n$$\nUsing the Baker-Hausdorff lemma, $e^A B e^{-A} = B + [A,B] + \\frac{1}{2!}[A,[A,B]] + \\dots$, with $A=S$ and $B=b_j$:\nThe first commutator is $[S, b_{j}] = [\\lambda(b_{j}^{\\dagger}-b_{j}), b_{j}] = \\lambda [b_{j}^{\\dagger}, b_{j}] = -\\lambda$, using the bosonic commutation relation $[b_{j}, b_{j}^{\\dagger}]=1$.\nThe next commutator is $[S, [S, b_{j}]] = [S, -\\lambda] = 0$. Thus, the series terminates.\nThe transformed annihilation operator is:\n$$\n\\tilde{b}_{j} = b_{j} + [S, b_{j}] = b_{j} - \\lambda\n$$\nSimilarly, for the creation operator $b_{j}^{\\dagger}$:\n$$\n[S, b_{j}^{\\dagger}] = [\\lambda(b_{j}^{\\dagger}-b_{j}), b_{j}^{\\dagger}] = -\\lambda [b_{j}, b_{j}^{\\dagger}] = -\\lambda\n$$\nSo the transformed creation operator is:\n$$\n\\tilde{b}_{j}^{\\dagger} = U b_{j}^{\\dagger} U^{\\dagger} = b_{j}^{\\dagger} + [S, b_{j}^{\\dagger}] = b_{j}^{\\dagger} - \\lambda\n$$\nNow, we substitute these into the expression for the transformed Hamiltonian:\n$$\n\\tilde{H}_{j} = U (\\omega_{0} b_{j}^{\\dagger} b_{j} + g (b_{j} + b_{j}^{\\dagger})) U^{\\dagger} = \\omega_{0} (U b_{j}^{\\dagger} U^{\\dagger})(U b_{j} U^{\\dagger}) + g (U b_{j} U^{\\dagger} + U b_{j}^{\\dagger} U^{\\dagger})\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{H}_{j} = \\omega_{0} (b_{j}^{\\dagger} - \\lambda)(b_{j} - \\lambda) + g ((b_{j} - \\lambda) + (b_{j}^{\\dagger} - \\lambda))\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{H}_{j} = \\omega_{0} (b_{j}^{\\dagger}b_{j} - \\lambda b_{j}^{\\dagger} - \\lambda b_{j} + \\lambda^2) + g (b_{j} + b_{j}^{\\dagger} - 2\\lambda)\n$$\nGrouping terms, we get:\n$$\n\\tilde{H}_{j} = \\omega_{0} b_{j}^{\\dagger}b_{j} + (g - \\omega_{0}\\lambda)b_{j}^{\\dagger} + (g - \\omega_{0}\\lambda)b_{j} + \\omega_{0}\\lambda^2 - 2g\\lambda\n$$\nThe purpose of the transformation is to eliminate the linear coupling terms. We achieve this by choosing $\\lambda$ such that the coefficients of $b_{j}$ and $b_{j}^{\\dagger}$ are zero:\n$$\ng - \\omega_{0}\\lambda = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\lambda = \\frac{g}{\\omega_{0}}\n$$\nWith this choice of $\\lambda$, the transformed Hamiltonian becomes diagonal in the phonon number operator:\n$$\n\\tilde{H}_{j} = \\omega_{0} b_{j}^{\\dagger}b_{j} + \\omega_{0} \\left(\\frac{g}{\\omega_{0}}\\right)^2 - 2g\\left(\\frac{g}{\\omega_{0}}\\right) = \\omega_{0} b_{j}^{\\dagger}b_{j} + \\frac{g^2}{\\omega_{0}} - \\frac{2g^2}{\\omega_{0}}\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{H}_{j} = \\omega_{0} b_{j}^{\\dagger}b_{j} - \\frac{g^2}{\\omega_{0}}\n$$\nThis is the Hamiltonian of an unperturbed harmonic oscillator shifted by a constant energy. The ground state of this Hamiltonian is the phonon vacuum $|0\\rangle_{j}$, for which $b_{j}^{\\dagger}b_{j}|0\\rangle_{j} = 0$. The ground-state energy of $\\tilde{H}_{j}$ is therefore $E_{g.s.}^{\\text{transformed}} = -\\frac{g^2}{\\omega_{0}}$.\nSince $H_{j}$ and $\\tilde{H}_{j}$ are related by a unitary transformation, they share the same eigenvalue spectrum. Thus, the ground-state energy of the original interacting Hamiltonian $H_{j}$ is $E_{g.s.} = -\\frac{g^2}{\\omega_{0}}$.\n\nThe problem defines the polaron binding energy $E_{p}$ as the magnitude of the ground-state energy lowering caused by the electron-phonon interaction. To find this lowering, we compare the ground-state energy of the interacting system ($g \\neq 0$) with that of the non-interacting system ($g=0$).\nFor $g=0$, the Hamiltonian is $H_{j, g=0} = \\omega_{0} b_{j}^{\\dagger}b_{j}$, whose ground-state energy is $0$.\nThe energy lowering is $\\Delta E = E_{g.s.} - E_{g.s., g=0} = -\\frac{g^2}{\\omega_{0}} - 0 = -\\frac{g^2}{\\omega_{0}}$.\nThe polaron binding energy is the magnitude of this value:\n$$\nE_{p} = |\\Delta E| = \\left| -\\frac{g^2}{\\omega_{0}} \\right| = \\frac{g^2}{\\omega_{0}}\n$$\n\nTo justify this result, we relate it to a classical displaced harmonic oscillator. We can express the phonon operators in terms of dimensionless position and momentum operators, $q_{j} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(b_{j} + b_{j}^{\\dagger})$ and $p_{j} = \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}}(b_{j}^{\\dagger} - b_{j})$, which satisfy $[q_j, p_j]=i$. The Hamiltonian $H_{j}$ (ignoring the constant zero-point energy term) becomes:\n$$\nH_{j} = \\frac{\\omega_{0}}{2}(p_{j}^{2} + q_{j}^{2}) + g\\sqrt{2} q_{j}\n$$\nThe potential energy of the oscillator is $V(q_{j}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_{0} q_{j}^{2} + g\\sqrt{2} q_{j}$. This describes a harmonic potential $\\frac{1}{2}\\omega_{0} q_{j}^{2}$ subjected to a constant force $F = -g\\sqrt{2}$ from the electron. The minimum of this potential corresponds to the new equilibrium position of the oscillator. We find it by setting the derivative to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dq_{j}} = \\omega_{0} q_{j} + g\\sqrt{2} = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad q_{j, \\text{eq}} = -\\frac{g\\sqrt{2}}{\\omega_{0}}\n$$\nThe energy at this new equilibrium displacement is the minimum potential energy:\n$$\nV_{\\text{min}} = V(q_{j, \\text{eq}}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_{0}\\left(-\\frac{g\\sqrt{2}}{\\omega_{0}}\\right)^2 + g\\sqrt{2}\\left(-\\frac{g\\sqrt{2}}{\\omega_{0}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nV_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_{0}\\left(\\frac{2g^2}{\\omega_{0}^2}\\right) - \\frac{2g^2}{\\omega_{0}} = \\frac{g^2}{\\omega_{0}} - \\frac{2g^2}{\\omega_{0}} = -\\frac{g^2}{\\omega_{0}}\n$$\nThis minimum potential energy is precisely the value of the ground-state energy shift we calculated quantum mechanically. It represents the energy stored in the static deformation of the lattice caused by the presence of the electron. This \"lattice deformation energy\" is released when the polaron forms, binding the electron to its own polarization cloud. The magnitude of this energy is the polaron binding energy, $E_{p} = |V_{\\text{min}}| = \\frac{g^2}{\\omega_{0}}$, confirming our previous result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{g^2}{\\omega_0}}$$", "id": "3010648"}, {"introduction": "Having established the energy of a static, self-trapped polaron, we now explore its dynamics.
