This transition is driven by the electron-phonon interaction, which at low temperatures leads to a static periodic lattice distortion and the opening of an energy gap $\\Delta$ at the Fermi level. The relationship between the transition temperature $T_p$ and the zero-temperature gap $\\Delta_0$ is described by a universal relation analogous to that in BCS theory of superconductivity, $k_B T_p \\propto \\Delta_0$.\n\nThe zero-temperature gap $\\Delta_0$ can be found from the following self-consistency equation:\n$$\n1 = \\lambda \\int_0^{E_c} \\frac{d\\epsilon}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon^2 + \\Delta_0^2}}\n$$\nHere, $\\lambda$ is the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling constant, which can be considered independent of the ionic mass $M$.

While a simple static model suggests using the Fermi energy $E_F$ as the cutoff, a more refined physical picture, analogous to superconductivity, recognizes that the interaction is mediated by virtual phonons.
