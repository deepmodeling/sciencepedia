This exercise moves from local geometry to the global properties of an infinite aperiodic tiling, using the classic Penrose P2 tiling as a model.

It is constructed from two types of rhombi: a \"fat\" rhombus with angles $2\\pi/5$ and $3\\pi/5$, and a \"thin\" rhombus with angles $\\pi/5$ and $4\\pi/5$. These tiles aperiodically cover the entire plane.\n\nWe are interested in the properties of the vertices of this tiling. A vertex is a point where the corners of multiple rhombi meet. The coordination number, $Z$, of a vertex is defined as the number of edges that meet at that point. In an infinite Penrose P2 tiling, the coordination number is not the same for all vertices; there is a distribution of local vertex environments with different coordination numbers.\n\nThe average properties of such an infinite, aperiodic structure can be described using densities. Let $\\rho_V$, $\\rho_E$, and $\\rho_F$ be the number of vertices, edges, and faces (tiles) per unit area, respectively. For any 2D tiling, these densities are constrained by several topological relations.\n1.
