This practice explores the dramatic crossover from unentangled (Rouse) to entangled (reptation) dynamics.

For a given linear polymer, there exists a critical molecular weight, $M_c$, above which polymer chains become mutually entangled, significantly constraining their motion. This leads to a dramatic change in how the zero-shear viscosity, $\\eta_0$, scales with the molecular weight, $M$.\n\nThe behavior can be summarized by two distinct scaling regimes:\n\n1.  **Unentangled Regime ($M \\le M_c$):** The melt behaves according to the Rouse model. The chains are short enough that they do not form significant topological constraints with each other. In this regime, the zero-shear viscosity is directly proportional to the molecular weight:\n    $$\n    \\eta_0(M) \\propto M\n    $$\n\n2.  **Entangled Regime ($M \\ge M_c$):** The chains are long and form a complex, entangled network. The motion of a single chain is described by the reptation model, where it is confined to a \"tube\" formed by its neighbors. While early theories predicted a simple cubic scaling, extensive experimental data have established a more accurate empirical power law:\n    $$\n    \\eta_0(M) \\propto M^\\beta\n    $$\n    where the exponent $\\beta$ is a well-established experimental value for many linear polymers, given by $\\beta = 17/5$.\n\nAssume that the viscosity function $\\eta_0(M)$ is continuous at the crossover point $M = M_c$.\n\nConsider two monodisperse melts of the same linear polymer. Melt A has a molecular weight equal to the critical entanglement weight, $M_A = M_c$. Melt B has a molecular weight ten times the critical value, $M_B = 10 M_c$.\n\nCalculate the exact ratio of the zero-shear viscosity of the entangled melt to that of the melt at the critical point, $\\frac{\\eta_0(M_B)}{\\eta_0(M_A)}$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the ratio of zero-shear viscosities, $\\frac{\\eta_0(10M_c)}{\\eta_0(M_c)}$, for a polymer melt, given the scaling behaviors in two different regimes of molecular weight $M$.\n\nFirst, we express the scaling relations with proportionality constants.
