Instead, the sample enters an **intermediate state** over a range of applied fields. In this state, the material is a fine-scale mixture of normal and superconducting domains. A crucial property of the intermediate state is that the internal magnetic field is \"pinned\" at the critical value, i.e., $H_{int} = H_c$.
