The problem is chemically and physically sound. It describes a canonical high-temperature superconductor, $\\mathrm{La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4}$, and a standard experimental procedure (annealing in an inert atmosphere) used to control its oxygen content and, consequently, its electronic properties. The given nominal valences, atomic masses, and structural type (K$_2$NiF$_4$) are all correct for this system. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to calculate the final oxygen deficiency and the resulting hole concentration. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three main steps:\n1.  Establish the initial chemical formula and calculate the corresponding molar mass of the compound before annealing.\n2.  Use the given relative mass loss fraction, $f$, to determine the final oxygen deficiency, $\\delta$.\n3.  Apply the principle of charge neutrality to the final chemical formula to solve for the hole concentration, $p$.\n\nStep 1: Initial State and Molar Mass\nThe problem describes a sample that is first synthesized and then annealed. We must make a justified assumption about the oxygen stoichiometry of the initial, pre-annealed state. The standard and most reasonable assumption for as-synthesized $\\mathrm{La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4}$ is that it is fully oxygenated, meaning its oxygen content is stoichiometric. This corresponds to an initial oxygen deficiency of zero. The subsequent annealing step is what introduces a non-zero deficiency. Therefore, we assume the initial formula is $\\mathrm{La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4}$. The ionic radii information, $r_{\\mathrm{Sr^{2+}}} > r_{\\mathrm{La^{3+}}}$, indicates a size mismatch at the lanthanum site, which induces chemical pressure. However, without further information, this does not invalidate the standard assumption of initial oxygen stoichiometry; it is a known feature of this material system.\n\nGiven the strontium content $x = 0.18$, the initial chemical formula is $\\mathrm{La_{1.82}Sr_{0.18}CuO_4}$.\nThe initial molar mass, $M_i$, of this compound is calculated using the provided atomic masses: $M_{\\mathrm{La}} = 138.9055\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$, $M_{\\mathrm{Sr}} = 87.62\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$, $M_{\\mathrm{Cu}} = 63.546\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$, and $M_{\\mathrm{O}} = 15.999\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n$$M_i = (2-x)M_{\\mathrm{La}} + x M_{\\mathrm{Sr}} + M_{\\mathrm{Cu}} + 4 M_{\\mathrm{O}}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$M_i = (1.82)(138.9055\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}) + (0.18)(87.62\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}) + 63.546\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}} + (4)(15.999\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}})$$\n$$M_i = 252.80801\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}} + 15.7716\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}} + 63.546\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}} + 63.996\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}} = 396.12161\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$$\n\nStep 2: Final Oxygen Deficiency\nAfter annealing, the material loses oxygen, and its formula becomes $\\mathrm{La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_{4-\\delta}}$. The mass loss per formula unit is $\\delta \\cdot M_{\\mathrm{O}}$. The relative mass loss fraction, $f$, is the ratio of the mass lost to the initial mass. For one mole of the substance:\n$$f = \\frac{\\text{mass loss}}{\\text{initial mass}} = \\frac{\\delta \\cdot M_{\\mathrm{O}}}{M_i}$$\nWe can solve for the final oxygen deficiency, $\\delta$:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{f \\cdot M_i}{M_{\\mathrm{O}}}$$\nUsing the given value $f = 8.00 \\times 10^{-4}$:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{(8.00 \\times 10^{-4}) \\cdot (396.12161\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}})}{15.999\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}} \\approx 0.0198072$$\n\nStep 3: Charge Neutrality and Hole Concentration\nThe principle of charge neutrality requires the total charge per formula unit to be zero. The final formula is $\\mathrm{La_{1.82}Sr_{0.18}CuO_{4-\\delta}}$. The nominal valences are $\\mathrm{La^{3+}}$, $\\mathrm{Sr^{2+}}$, $\\mathrm{Cu^{2+p}}$, and $\\mathrm{O^{2-}}$.\nThe charge balance equation is:\n$$(2-x)(+3) + x(+2) + (1)(2+p) + (4-\\delta)(-2) = 0$$\nSubstituting $x=0.18$:\n$$(1.82)(+3) + (0.18)(+2) + (2+p) + (4-\\delta)(-2) = 0$$\n$$5.46 + 0.36 + 2 + p - 8 + 2\\delta = 0$$\n$$7.82 + p - 8 + 2\\delta = 0$$\n$$-0.18 + p + 2\\delta = 0$$\nSolving for the hole concentration, $p$:\n$$p = 0.18 - 2\\delta$$\nThis equation shows that the hole concentration is equal to the strontium content $x=0.18$ for a fully oxygenated sample ($\\delta=0$) and decreases as oxygen is removed ($\\delta > 0$).\n\nNow, we substitute the calculated value of $\\delta$ to find the final hole concentration $p$:\n$$p = 0.18 - 2(0.0198072)$$\n$$p = 0.18 - 0.0396144$$\n$$p \\approx 0.1403856$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$p \\approx 0.140$$\nThus, the final hole concentration per copper atom after annealing is $0.140$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.140}$$", "id": "2828432"}, {"introduction": "A hallmark of unconventional superconductivity in the cuprates is the $d$-wave symmetry of the pairing state, where the superconducting gap changes sign across the Fermi surface.

Since the data is noise-free and generated from the same model, the fit is expected to recover the true parameters to within machine precision, i.e., $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} \\approx \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{true}}$.\n\n3.  **Compute the Ratio:**\n    - From the estimated parameter vector $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$, extract the first two components, $\\hat{t}$ and $\\hat{t}'$.\n    - Calculate the desired ratio $r = \\hat{t}'/\\hat{t}$.\n    - Round the result to $6$ decimal places as specified.\n\nThis procedure is repeated for each of the $4$ test cases provided. The doping parameter $p$ serves only as an identifier for each parameter set and is not used in the calculations.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the tight-binding parameter ratio t'/t for several doping cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Test suite (doping p, t, t', t'').
