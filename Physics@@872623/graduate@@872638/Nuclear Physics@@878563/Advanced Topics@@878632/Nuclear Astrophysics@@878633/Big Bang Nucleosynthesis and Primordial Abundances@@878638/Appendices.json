A key parameter governing this process is the neutron-to-proton mass-energy difference, $Q_0 = m_n c^2 - m_p c^2$. The ratio of neutrons to protons, $n/p$, is maintained in thermal equilibrium through weak interactions (e.g., $n + \\nu_e \\leftrightarrow p + e^-$) at high temperatures. In equilibrium, this ratio is given by the Boltzmann factor $(n/p)_{eq} = \\exp(-Q_0/(k_B T))$.\n\nAs the universe expands and cools, the weak interaction rate falls below the Hubble expansion rate, and the $n/p$ ratio \"freezes out\" at a temperature $T_f$. After freeze-out, the ratio is no longer in thermal equilibrium and evolves primarily through free neutron decay, $n \\to p + e^- + \\bar{\\nu}_e$, with a mean lifetime $\\tau_n$. At a later time $t_{nuc}$, when the temperature drops sufficiently for deuterium to be stable against photodisintegration, nearly all surviving neutrons are rapidly converted into Helium-4 ($^4\\text{He}$). The freeze-out time $t_f$ is much smaller than $t_{nuc}$.\n\nThe primordial helium mass fraction, $Y_p$, is defined as the mass of $^4\\text{He}$ divided by the total baryonic mass. Assuming all neutrons available at $t_{nuc}$ form $^4\\text{He}$, this fraction is given by $Y_p = \\frac{2 (n/p)_{nuc}}{1 + (n/p)_{nuc}}$, where $(n/p)_{nuc}$ is the neutron-to-proton ratio at time $t_{nuc}$.\n\nConsider a hypothetical universe where the fundamental constants are slightly different, such that the neutron-proton mass difference is larger by a fractional amount $\\epsilon$. The new mass difference is $Q' = (1+\\epsilon)Q_0$.

The final abundance of $^7$Li is of particular interest due to a long-standing discrepancy between theoretical predictions and observations. Most primordial $^7$Li is produced via the electron capture decay of $^7$Be ($^7$Be + e$^-$ $\\rightarrow$ $^7$Li + $\\nu_e$) long after the nuclear reactions have ceased. Therefore, to calculate the primordial $^7$Li abundance, one must first calculate the final, \"frozen-out\" abundance of its progenitor, $^7$Be.\n\nConsider a simplified model for the abundance of $^7$Be, denoted by its mass fraction relative to baryons, $Y_{Be}$.

It is well approximated by the equilibrium abundance evaluated at a specific freeze-out temperature, $T_F$.\n\n1.  The freeze-out temperature $T_F$ is defined as the temperature at which the rate of the main destruction reaction per particle equals the Hubble expansion rate $H(T)$. The destruction rate per $^7$Be nucleus is $\\Gamma_{dest} = n_n \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{dest}$, where $n_n$ is the neutron number density and $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{dest}$ is the thermally-averaged cross section for the destruction reaction.
