Often, peaks from different radionuclides can overlap, necessitating a simultaneous fit to disentangle their contributions. This problem concerns the statistical uncertainty associated with such a fit.\n\nConsider a region of a gamma-ray spectrum spanning $N$ channels, indexed by $i=1, \\dots, N$. This region contains two overlapping peaks sitting on a constant background. The number of counts measured in channel $i$ is denoted by $d_i$. The expected number of counts in channel $i$, denoted by $y_i$, is modeled as a linear combination of two known peak shapes and a constant background:\n\n$$\ny_i = A_1 g_1(i) + A_2 g_2(i) + B_0\n$$\n\nHere:\n- $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the net areas (amplitudes) of peak 1 and peak 2, respectively.\n- $g_1(i)$ and $g_2(i)$ are the known, normalized shape functions for peak 1 and peak 2 at channel $i$. These functions describe the shape (e.g., Gaussian) of the peaks, and are treated as known constants for the purpose of the fit.\n- $B_0$ is the constant background level (counts per channel).\n\nThe three parameters to be determined from the experimental data $\\{d_i\\}$ are the peak areas $A_1$, $A_2$, and the background $B_0$.
