This shift arises from the different spatial extents of the valence nucleon wavefunctions, which is particularly pronounced for low angular momentum states. We can model this effect using single-channel R-matrix theory.\n\nConsider a simple model for a pair of mirror nuclei.

The bound neutron-rich mirror is modeled as a single valence neutron, also of reduced mass $\\mu$, interacting with the corresponding mirror core.\n\nThe nucleon-core interaction is described by a spherical square well potential of depth $V_0 > 0$ and radius $a$. For the proton, an additional repulsive Coulomb potential is present. To simplify the analytics, we model this Coulomb potential as a constant, $V_C > 0$, for $r \\le a$, and as the standard point-charge potential for $r > a$.\n\nWe focus on the lowest-lying s-wave ($L=0$) state in both nuclei. The nuclear potential depth $V_0$ is tuned such that the neutron state is exactly at the binding threshold, i.e., its energy is $E_n = 0$. For a zero-energy s-wave state, the external wavefunction is constant, implying its derivative is zero. Thus, the logarithmic derivative of the internal wavefunction must be zero at the channel radius $a$.\n\nIn the R-matrix formalism, the properties of a resonance are related to the poles and residues of the R-matrix, which are determined by the eigenstates of the internal Hamiltonian subjected to a specific boundary condition at the channel radius $a$. To be consistent with the physical condition imposed on the neutron system, we define the R-matrix basis states $u_\\lambda(r)$ for the internal region ($r \\le a$) by the boundary condition that the derivative of the radial wavefunction is zero at the channel radius: $u_\\lambda'(a) = 0$.\n\nUsing the potential depth $V_0$ determined by the neutron threshold condition, calculate the R-matrix s-wave reduced width, $\\gamma_p^2$, for the corresponding single-proton state.
