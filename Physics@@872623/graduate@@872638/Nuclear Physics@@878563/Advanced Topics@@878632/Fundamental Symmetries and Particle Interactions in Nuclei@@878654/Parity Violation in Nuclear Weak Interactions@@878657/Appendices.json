In the Standard Model, the weak force is known to violate parity conservation. This violation manifests in nuclear physics through a parity-violating (PV) nucleon-nucleon potential, $V_{PV}$, which induces a small admixture of opposite-parity states into nuclear wave functions.\n\nConsider the tritium beta decay, $^3\\text{H} \\to {}^3\\text{He} + e^{-} + \\bar{\\nu}_{e}$. The initial state, the tritium ground state $|\\Psi_i\\rangle$, has quantum numbers $J^P = 1/2^+$. The PV interaction mixes this state with excited states of opposite parity. We consider the dominant admixture to be with a single effective state $|\\Psi^*\\rangle$ with $J^P=1/2^-$. The parity-mixed initial state is thus given by:\n$$|\\tilde{\\Psi}_i\\rangle = |\\Psi_i\\rangle + \\alpha |\\Psi^*\\rangle$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a small, real mixing coefficient. The final state, the $^3$He ground state $|\\Psi_f\\rangle$, is considered to be a pure $J^P=1/2^+$ state for simplicity.\n\nThe standard allowed transition is governed by the Gamow-Teller operator, which is the space component of the axial-vector current:\n$$O_{GT} = g_A \\sum_{k=1}^A \\vec{\\sigma}_k \\tau_{+,k}$$\nwhere $g_A$ is the axial-vector coupling constant, $\\vec{\\sigma}_k$ is the Pauli spin operator, and $\\tau_{+,k}$ is the isospin raising operator for nucleon $k$.\n\nThe parity admixture allows for a competing first-forbidden transition, which interferes with the allowed GT transition. We consider the contribution from the time component of the axial-vector current, a pseudoscalar operator:\n$$O_{PS} = \\frac{g'_A}{2M_N} \\sum_{k=1}^A (\\vec{\\sigma}_k \\cdot \\vec{p}_k) \\tau_{+,k}$$\nwhere $g'_A$ is a relevant axial coupling, $M_N$ is the nucleon mass, and $\\vec{p}_k$ is the momentum operator of nucleon $k$.\n\nThe goal is to compute the ratio, $\\mathcal{R}$, of the PV-induced forbidden matrix element to the allowed GT matrix element.
