In the QPM, the spin-dependent structure function $g_1^N(x)$ for a nucleon $N$ (either proton $p$ or neutron $n$) is expressed in terms of the helicity-dependent parton distribution functions (PDFs) $\\Delta q_f^N(x) = q_f^{\\uparrow}(x) - q_f^{\\downarrow}(x)$, where $q^{\\uparrow(\\downarrow)}$ is the distribution for a quark with helicity parallel (anti-parallel) to the nucleon's helicity.

The nucleon axial vector coupling constant, $g_A$, is defined via the matrix element of the axial portion of the weak charged current responsible for neutron beta decay. Isospin symmetry relates different components of the isovector axial current.
