The lowest-energy configuration for its valence nucleons involves an odd proton in the Nilsson orbital $p_1: K_p^{\\pi_p} = \\frac{9}{2}^-$ and an odd neutron in the orbital $n_1: K_n^{\\pi_n} = \\frac{7}{2}^+$.\n\nIn such nuclei, the projection of the total nuclear angular momentum on the symmetry axis, $K$, is formed by coupling the individual projections of the constituent proton ($K_p$) and neutron ($K_n$). According to the Gallagher-Moszkowski (GM) coupling rules, two states are formed, a lower-energy ground state and a higher-energy isomeric state. For this specific proton-neutron configuration, the isomeric state corresponds to the parallel coupling of intrinsic spins, resulting in a state with $K_i = K_p + K_n$, while the ground state band is built upon the antiparallel coupling which results in a state with $K_{gs} = |K_p - K_n|$. We assume the spin of the states in the $K$-band is given by $I=K$.\n\nThe isomer is observed to decay via a gamma-ray transition to a state within the rotational band built on the ground state configuration. The specific transition is from the isomeric state with spin and parity $I_i^{\\pi_i}$ and K-quantum number $K_i$, to a final state with $I_f^{\\pi_f}$ belonging to the ground state band (with K-quantum number $K_f = K_{gs}$).\n\nThe properties of this decay are:\n- Initial (isomeric) state: $I_i = K_i = K_p + K_n = 8$ with negative parity.\n- Final state: $I_f = 6$ with negative parity, a member of the ground-state band with $K_f = |K_p - K_n|=1$.\n- Mass number of the nucleus: $A$.\n- Energy of the emitted gamma-ray: $E_\\gamma$.\n- Experimentally measured half-life of the isomer: $T_{1/2, \\text{exp}}$.\n\nThe Weisskopf single-particle estimate for the transition rate of an electric multipole transition of order $L$ (EL) is given by:\n$$ \\lambda_W(EL) = C_{EL} A^{2L/3} E_\\gamma^{2L+1} $$\nwhere $C_{EL}$ is a constant that depends on the multipole order $L$.\n\nIn deformed nuclei, an additional selection rule applies to the K-quantum number: for a transition to be \"K-allowed\", it must satisfy $\\Delta K \\leq L$, where $\\Delta K = |K_i - K_f|$ and $L$ is the multipolarity of the radiation.
