We proceed to the solution.\n\n**Solution Method**\nThe objective is to find the binding energy $B$ by solving the transcendental equation for each given set of parameters $(R, V_0)$. The equation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\mu(V_0 - B)}}{\\hbar c} \\cot\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\mu(V_0 - B)}}{\\hbar c} R\\right) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\mu B}}{\\hbar c} $$\nThis is a root-finding problem for a function of $B$. Let us define this function $f(B)$:\n$$ f(B) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\mu(V_0 - B)}}{\\hbar c} \\cot\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\mu(V_0 - B)}}{\\hbar c} R\\right) + \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\mu B}}{\\hbar c} = k(B) \\cot(k(B)R) + \\kappa(B) = 0 $$\nA bound state requires $k$ and $\\kappa$ to be real and positive, which implies $0 < B < V_0$. For the equation $k \\cot(kR) = -\\kappa$ to hold, we must have $\\cot(kR) < 0$. For the ground state, which is the most tightly bound state (largest $B$, lowest total energy $E$), the wave number $k$ takes the largest possible value, and the argument $kR$ must lie in the first interval where the cotangent is negative:\n$$ \\frac{\\pi}{2} < kR < \\pi $$\nSubstituting the definition of $k$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\mu(V_0-B)}}{\\hbar c} R < \\pi $$\nA necessary condition for any bound state to exist is that this inequality must be satisfiable for some $B \\in (0, V_0)$. This is only possible if the potential well is sufficiently \"strong.\" Setting $B \\to 0$ gives the minimum strength requirement:\n$$ \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\mu V_0}}{\\hbar c} R > \\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\nSquaring this expression yields the condition on the product $V_0 R^2$:\n$$ V_0 R^2 > \\frac{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^2}{8\\mu} $$\nIf this condition is not met for a given test case, no $s$-wave bound state exists, and the binding energy is $B = 0.0$.\n\nIf the condition is met, a unique ground-state solution for $B$ exists. We can establish a rigorous search interval, or bracket, for a numerical root-finding algorithm. The inequality $\\frac{\\pi}{2} < kR$ implies:\n$$ \\frac{\\pi^2}{4} < \\frac{2\\mu(V_0-B)R^2}{(\\hbar c)^2} \\implies V_0 - B > \\frac{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^2}{8\\mu R^2} \\implies B < V_0 - \\frac{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^2}{8\\mu R^2} $$\nThis gives a strict upper bound for $B$. Since we also require $B>0$, a valid search interval for the root is $(0, B_{upper})$, where $B_{upper} = V_0 - \\frac{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^2}{8\\mu R^2}$.\n\nWe will employ Brent's method, a robust numerical algorithm that combines bisection, the secant method, and inverse quadratic interpolation. It is guaranteed to find a root if given an interval $[a, b]$ where $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs.\nLet us analyze the signs of $f(B)$ at the boundaries of our search interval $(0, B_{upper})$.\n- As $B \\to 0^+$, $f(B) \\approx \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\mu V_0}}{\\hbar c} \\cot\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\mu V_0}}{\\hbar c} R\\right)$. If a solution exists, we have shown $\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\mu V_0}}{\\hbar c} R > \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, which places the argument in a region where $\\cot$ is negative. Thus, $f(B \\to 0^+) < 0$.\n- As $B \\to B_{upper}^-$, $kR \\to (\\frac{\\pi}{2})^+$, causing $\\cot(kR) \\to 0$. Therefore, $f(B_{upper}) = \\kappa(B_{upper}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\mu B_{upper}}}{\\hbar c} > 0$.\n\nWith $f(0^+) < 0$ and $f(B_{upper}) > 0$, the interval $[ \\epsilon, B_{upper}-\\delta ]$ for small positive $\\epsilon, \\delta$ forms a valid bracket for Brent's method.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Calculate the reduced mass $\\mu$ and the constant factor $\\frac{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^2}{8\\mu}$.\n2.  For each test case $(R, V_0)$:\n    a. Calculate the potential strength parameter $V_0 R^2$.\n    b. Compare it with the threshold $\\frac{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^2}{8\\mu}$. If it is less than or equal to the threshold, no bound state exists; the result is $0.0$.\n    c. If it is greater, a bound state exists. Define the function $f(B)$ and the bracketing interval $[a, b] = [\\epsilon, V_0 - \\frac{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^2}{8\\mu R^2}]$, where $\\epsilon$ is a small positive number to avoid $B=0$.\n    d. Use a numerical solver (specifically, `scipy.optimize.brentq`) to find the root of $f(B)=0$ within this bracket.\n    e. Report the resulting binding energy $B$, rounded to $6$ decimal places.\n\nThis procedure provides a complete and correct method for solving the problem.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import brentq\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the deuteron s-wave ground-state binding energy in a finite\n    spherical square-well potential for a given set of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case is (R in fm, V0 in MeV).\n    test_cases = [\n        (2.0, 35.0),  # Case A\n        (2.0, 25.58), # Case B\n        (1.5, 80.0),  # Case C\n        (2.0, 20.0),  # Case D\n    ]\n\n    # Physical constants in specified units (MeV, fm)\n    mp_c2 = 938.2720813  # Proton mass in MeV/c^2\n    mn_c2 = 939.5654133  # Neutron mass in MeV/c^2\n    hbar_c = 197.3269804 # h-bar * c in MeV*fm\n\n    # Calculate reduced mass in MeV/c^2\n    mu_c2 = (mp_c2 * mn_c2) / (mp_c2 + mn_c2)\n\n    # Pre-calculate the existence condition threshold for V0 * R^2\n    # A bound state exists if V0 * R^2 > threshold\n    existence_threshold = (np.pi**2 * hbar_c**2) / (8 * mu_c2)\n    \n    # Pre-calculate a constant factor used in k and kappa definitions\n    # 2*mu / (hbar_c)^2 in units of 1/(MeV*fm^2)\n    const_factor = 2 * mu_c2 / hbar_c**2\n\n    results = []\n    for R, V0 in test_cases:\n        # Check if a bound state can exist\n        if V0 * R**2 <= existence_threshold:\n            binding_energy = 0.0\n        else:\n            # A bound state exists, find its energy B.\n            # We need to find the root of the transcendental equation:\n            # k * cot(k*R) + kappa = 0\n            # where k = sqrt(const_factor * (V0 - B))\n            # and kappa = sqrt(const_factor * B)\n\n            def transcendental_eq(B, R_val, V0_val):\n                \"\"\"The function f(B) for which we seek a root f(B)=0.\"\"\"\n                # Domain check for safety, although brentq should stay in bounds.\n                if B <= 0 or B >= V0_val:\n                    # Should not be reached with a proper bracket\n                    return np.inf\n\n                k = np.sqrt(const_factor * (V0_val - B))\n                kappa = np.sqrt(const_factor * B)\n                \n                arg = k * R_val\n                \n                # The cotangent term: k * cot(k*R)\n                # Handle argument k*R being a multiple of pi, where cot is infinite.\n                # In our bracket, k*R is between pi/2 and pi, so no singularity.\n                # However, for robustness, it is good practice.\n                if np.isclose(np.sin(arg), 0.0):\n                    # In this case k*cot(k*R) diverges.

The binding energy is given by $B = \\gamma^2 / M_N$.\n\nGiven that the scattering length $a_t$ is anomalously large and positive, while the effective range $r_t$ is of a natural size (i.e., $|r_t| \\ll a_t$), one can treat the effective range term as a perturbation. The deuteron binding energy can be expanded as a series $B = B_{\\mathrm{LO}} + B_{\\mathrm{NLO}} + \\dots$, where $B_{\\mathrm{LO}}$ is the leading-order result (depending only on $a_t$) and $B_{\\mathrm{NLO}}$ is the first correction (proportional to $r_t$).\n\nYour task is to determine the NLO correction to the deuteron binding energy, $B_{\\mathrm{NLO}}$, as a function of the nucleon mass $M_N$, the triplet scattering length $a_t$, and the triplet effective range $r_t$.", "solution": "1.
