The Q-value of the reaction is denoted by $Q$.\n\nIn such reactions, the kinetic energy of the ejectile, $T_b$, is a function of its emission angle $\\theta$ in the laboratory frame. A phenomenon known as \"kinematic focusing\" occurs when the ejectile's energy is locally stationary with respect to its emission angle, meaning there exists an angle $\\theta_f$ at which $dT_b/d\\theta = 0$.
