A charged projectile passes the nucleus, and the interaction is described within the semiclassical approximation, where the projectile follows a classical trajectory and generates a time-dependent electric field that perturbs the nucleus.\n\nWe analyze the process under the following simplifying assumptions:\n1.  The collision is head-on (impact parameter $b=0$). Due to the resulting axial symmetry, the magnetic quantum number $M$ of the nucleus is conserved. Since the nucleus starts in the $J=0, M=0$ ground state, only states with $M=0$ can be populated.\n2.  The interaction is very fast compared to the nuclear transition periods, so we can use the \"sudden approximation\".

At energies near the Coulomb barrier, both mechanisms can have comparable strength. The total transition amplitude, $f_{tot}$, is the coherent sum of the nuclear amplitude, $f_N$, and the Coulomb excitation amplitude, $f_C$.\n\n**Model:**\nWe adopt a simplified model where the amplitudes and the effects of mutual distortion are described by complex phases.\n\n1.  **Bare Amplitudes:** The \"bare\" transition amplitudes, in the absence of distortions from the other interaction, are given by:\n    -   Nuclear excitation: $f_N = A_N e^{i\\delta_N}$\n    -   Coulomb excitation: $f_C = A_C e^{i\\delta_C}$\n    Here, $A_N$ and $A_C$ are real, positive magnitudes, and $\\delta_N, \\delta_C$ are the intrinsic phases associated with the respective transition operators.\n\n2.  **Distortion Effects:** The presence of both nuclear and Coulomb potentials distorts the incoming and outgoing waves. This is modeled as a phase modification to the \"other\" amplitude:\n    -   The nuclear potential (short-range) primarily distorts the amplitude for the long-range Coulomb excitation, adding a phase $\\phi_N$.\n    -   The Coulomb potential (long-range) distorts the amplitude for the short-range nuclear excitation, adding a phase $\\phi_C$.\n\n    The fully-distorted amplitudes for the projectile scattering are therefore:\n    -   $f_{N,full} = f_N e^{i\\phi_C} = A_N e^{i(\\delta_N + \\phi_C)}$\n    -   $f_{C,full} = f_C e^{i\\phi_N} = A_C e^{i(\\delta_C + \\phi_N)}$\n\n3.  **Antiparticle Scattering:** Consider replacing the projectile with its antiparticle (e.g., a proton with an antiproton).

Thus, the bare nuclear amplitude $f_N$ and the nuclear distortion phase $\\phi_N$ are unchanged.\n    -   The electromagnetic interaction operator is proportional to the projectile's charge, so it flips sign.

The excitation of a nucleus from its ground state $|I_i, M_i\\rangle$ to an excited state $|I_f, M_f\\rangle$ is driven by the time-varying electromagnetic field of the projectile.\n\nFor an E2 transition from a $0^+$ ground state to a $2^+$ excited state, the first-order excitation probability can be significantly modified by the \"reorientation effect\". This is a second-order quantum process where the projectile excites the nucleus to the $2^+$ state, which then interacts with the projectile's field via its static spectroscopic quadrupole moment ($Q_2$) before the projectile has left. This leads to a reorientation of the nuclear spin within the magnetic substates of the $2^+$ level.\n\nThe leading correction to the excitation probability due to this reorientation effect is an interference term, which is first-order in $Q_2$.
