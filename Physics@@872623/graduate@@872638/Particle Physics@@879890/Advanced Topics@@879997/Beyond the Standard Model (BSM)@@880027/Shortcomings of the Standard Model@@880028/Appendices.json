This exercise explores a common strategy for remedying this: extending the SM with a new scalar field.

A common proposed solution is to extend the SM scalar sector. Consider a simplified extension where a real scalar singlet field, $s$, is added to the SM, with a tree-level potential that includes a portal coupling to the Higgs doublet $H$.\n\nFor this problem, we analyze the electroweak phase transition using a simplified effective potential for the background Higgs field $h$ (the neutral component of $H$ in the unitary gauge, $H=(0, h/\\sqrt{2})^T$) at the critical temperature $T_c$. The potential is given by:\n$$V_{eff}(h, T_c) = \\alpha h^2 - \\beta_{tot} T_c h^3 + \\frac{\\lambda_h}{4} h^4$$\nThis form is valid for field values $h \\ll T_c$. Here, $\\lambda_h$ is the Higgs self-coupling constant. The cubic term, which is essential for a first-order phase transition, arises from thermal loops of bosons whose masses are dependent on $h$. The coefficient $\\beta_{tot}$ is a sum of contributions from all such bosons: $\\beta_{tot} = \\sum_i \\beta_i$.

The singlet has one degree of freedom ($n_s=1$) and couples to the Higgs via a term $\\frac{\\lambda_{hs}}{4}h^2s^2$ in the fundamental potential. We make a simplifying assumption that other parameters in the singlet sector are tuned such that the singlet is effectively massless at the critical temperature $T_c$, so its field-dependent mass is purely from the Higgs VEV: $m_s^2(h) = \\frac{\\lambda_{hs}}{2}h^2$.\n\nTo prevent the baryon asymmetry from being washed out by sphaleron processes after the phase transition, the condition $\\frac{v_c}{T_c} \\ge \\xi$ must be satisfied, where $v_c$ is the non-zero Higgs vacuum expectation value at the critical temperature $T_c$, and $\\xi$ is a dimensionless order-one parameter.\n\nAssuming that the SM contribution is insufficient on its own (i.e., $\\frac{\\xi\\lambda_h}{2} > \\beta_{SM}$), find the minimum value of the portal coupling $\\lambda_{hs}$ required to satisfy the sphaleron washout condition.
