The total four-momentum of the system is conserved before and after the collision. The threshold energy corresponds to the minimum energy required to create the final state particles, which occurs when these particles are produced with zero kinetic energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame.\n\nLet's define the four-momentum of a particle with energy $E$ and three-momentum $\\vec{p}$ as $p^\\mu = (E/c, \\vec{p})$.
