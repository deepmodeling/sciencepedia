Identifying the Tunneling Path**\n\nThe bounce solution is an $O(4)$-symmetric field configuration that extremizes the Euclidean action $S_E$. We adopt the ansatz that fields depend only on the Euclidean radial coordinate $r = \\sqrt{x_\\mu x^\\mu}$, i.e., $\\chi = \\chi(r)$ and $\\theta = \\theta(r)$.\n\nThe configuration must minimize the potential energy at each point along the tunneling path.

Since $\\lambda>0$ and $\\sinh^2(\\chi/R) \\ge 0$, this term is minimized when $\\cos\\theta = -1$, which corresponds to $\\theta = \\pi$ (or $\\theta = (2k+1)\\pi$ for any integer $k$).\nThe kinetic term contribution from $\\theta$, which is proportional to $(\\partial_\\mu\\theta)^2$, is also minimized (to zero) if $\\theta$ is constant. Therefore, the bounce solution will lie along the geodesic ray $\\theta(r) = \\pi$.\n\n**2. The Effective One-Dimensional Potential**\n\nSubstituting $\\theta(r)=\\pi$ into the action, the problem reduces to a single-field problem for $\\chi(r)$ with an effective potential:\n$$ V_{\\text{eff}}(\\chi) = V_0(\\chi) + V_{\\text{angle}}(\\chi, \\pi) = V_0(\\chi) + \\lambda \\sinh^2\\left(\\frac{\\chi}{R}\\right)(1-1) = V_0(\\chi) $$\nSo, the effective potential is:\n$$ V_{\\text{eff}}(\\chi) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\sinh^2\\left(\\frac{\\chi}{R}\\right)\\left(\\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\chi}{R}\\right)-z_v\\right)^2 - \\delta\\left(\\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\chi}{R}\\right)-1\\right) $$\n\n**3. The Thin-Wall Approximation**\n\nThe bounce action in the thin-wall approximation is given by the formula:\n$$ S_B = \\frac{27\\pi^2 S_1^4}{2\\epsilon^3} $$\nwhere $S_1$ is the tension of the domain wall separating the false and true vacua, and $\\epsilon$ is the energy density difference between them. The thin-wall approximation is valid when the vacua are nearly degenerate.\n\nLet's analyze the effective potential by defining $z = \\cosh(\\chi/R)$. Since $\\chi \\ge 0$, we have $z \\ge 1$. Also, $\\sinh^2(\\chi/R) = z^2-1$. The potential becomes:\n$$ V_{\\text{eff}}(z) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2}(z^2-1)(z-z_v)^2 - \\delta(z-1) $$\nThe false vacuum (FV) is at $\\chi=0$, which corresponds to $z=1$.\n$V_{FV} = V_{\\text{eff}}(z=1) = 0$.\n\nThe thin-wall approximation recipe requires us to first consider the degenerate potential, which we obtain by setting $\\delta=0$:\n$$ V_{\\text{deg}}(z) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2}(z^2-1)(z-z_v)^2 $$\nThis potential has degenerate minima at $z=1$ ($\\chi=0$) and $z=z_v$ ($\\chi_v = R \\text{ arccosh}(z_v)$). The true vacuum (TV) of the full potential (with $\\delta\\neq 0$) is slightly shifted from $z=z_v$.\n\nThe energy difference $\\epsilon$ is given by $\\epsilon = V_{FV} - V_{TV}$.\nTo first order in the small parameter $\\delta$, the location of the true vacuum is still at $z \\approx z_v$.\n$V_{TV} = V_{\\text{eff}}(z \\approx z_v) \\approx \\frac{\\gamma}{2}(z_v^2-1)(z_v-z_v)^2 - \\delta(z_v-1) = -\\delta(z_v-1)$.\nThus, the energy density difference is $\\epsilon = 0 - (-\\delta(z_v-1)) = \\delta(z_v-1)$.\n\n**4. Calculating the Wall Tension $S_1$**\n\nThe wall tension $S_1$ is the action per unit area of a planar wall, which is calculated for the degenerate potential $V_{\\text{deg}}$:\n$$ S_1 = \\int_0^{\\chi_v} d\\chi \\sqrt{2V_{\\text{deg}}(\\chi)} $$\nwhere $\\chi_v = R \\text{ arccosh}(z_v)$ is the location of the true vacuum in the degenerate case.\nWe change the integration variable from $\\chi$ to $z=\\cosh(\\chi/R)$. The differential is $d\\chi = R \\frac{dz}{\\sqrt{z^2-1}}$.\n$$ S_1 = \\int_1^{z_v} R\\frac{dz}{\\sqrt{z^2-1}} \\sqrt{2 \\cdot \\frac{\\gamma}{2} (z^2-1)(z-z_v)^2} $$\n$$ S_1 = \\int_1^{z_v} R\\frac{dz}{\\sqrt{z^2-1}} \\sqrt{\\gamma(z^2-1)(z-z_v)^2} $$\nFor $z \\in [1, z_v]$, we have $z-z_v \\le 0$, so $|z-z_v|=z_v-z$.\n$$ S_1 = R\\sqrt{\\gamma} \\int_1^{z_v} \\frac{\\sqrt{z^2-1}(z_v-z)}{\\sqrt{z^2-1}} dz = R\\sqrt{\\gamma} \\int_1^{z_v} (z_v-z) dz $$\nNow we perform the elementary integration:\n$$ S_1 = R\\sqrt{\\gamma} \\left[z_v z - \\frac{z^2}{2}\\right]_1^{z_v} = R\\sqrt{\\gamma} \\left[ \\left(z_v^2 - \\frac{z_v^2}{2}\\right) - \\left(z_v - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ S_1 = R\\sqrt{\\gamma} \\left[ \\frac{z_v^2}{2} - z_v + \\frac{1}{2} \\right] = \\frac{R\\sqrt{\\gamma}}{2}(z_v^2 - 2z_v + 1) = \\frac{R\\sqrt{\\gamma}}{2}(z_v-1)^2 $$\n\n**5.
