The amplitude $\\mathcal{M}^{ba}$ can be decomposed based on its isospin and Lorentz structure. The part of the amplitude with isoscalar isospin structure is given by $\\mathcal{M}^+$. The general Lorentz structure of the spin-non-flip part of the isoscalar amplitude is described by an invariant function $A^+(\\nu, t)$, where the Mandelstam variables are $s=(p+q)^2$, $t=(q'-q)^2$, $u=(p-q')^2$, and the crossing variable is $\\nu = (s-u)/(4M_N)$, with $M_N$ being the nucleon mass.\n\n2.  **Current Algebra and PCAC:** In the framework of current algebra, the low-energy dynamics of pions are governed by the symmetries of the QCD Lagrangian. The axial-vector current $A_\\mu^a$ is not conserved due to the non-zero quark masses. PCAC formalizes this by relating its divergence to the pion field $\\phi^a$. A key result stemming from these principles is a low-energy theorem for the $\\pi N$ amplitude.\n\n3.  **Low-Energy Theorem:** After subtracting the nucleon-pole Born terms (which are zero for the $A^+$ amplitude), the resulting regularized amplitude $\\bar{A}^+(\\nu, t)$ is related to the matrix element of a double commutator involving the axial charges $Q_5^a = \\int d^3x A_0^a(x)$ and the chiral-symmetry-breaking part of the Hamiltonian, $H_{SB}$. Specifically, at the unphysical point $\\nu=0$, the theorem states:\n    $$A^+(\\nu=0, t) = \\frac{F_\\sigma(t)}{f_\\pi^2}$$\n    where $f_\\pi$ is the pion decay constant. $F_\\sigma(t)$ is a form factor associated with the a \"sigma commutator\". For the purposes of this problem, assume $H_{SB}$ is an isospin singlet. This simplifies the commutator:\n    $$[Q_5^a, [Q_5^b, H_{SB}]] = \\delta^{ab} \\sigma_\\text{op}$$\n    where $\\sigma_\\text{op}$ is a scalar operator.
