This relation can be derived by studying nucleon form factors and applying the principle of Partially Conserved Axial-vector Current (PCAC).\n\nThis problem asks you to derive the Goldberger-Treiman relation in the chiral limit ($m_\\pi \\to 0$) by relating different nucleon form factors.\n\n**Background and Definitions:**\n\nConsider a theory with nucleon fields (isospin doublet $\\Psi$), an axial-vector current $A_\\mu^a(x)$, and a pseudoscalar density $P^a(x)$, where $a$ is an isospin index.\n\n1.  **Nucleon Matrix Element of the Axial Current:**\n    The Euclidean matrix element of the axial-vector current $A_\\mu^a$ between nucleon states of momentum $p$ and $p'$ is parameterized by two form factors, the axial form factor $g_A(Q^2)$ and the induced pseudoscalar form factor $g_P(Q^2)$:\n    $$\n    \\langle N(p') | A_\\mu^a(0) | N(p) \\rangle = \\bar{u}(p') \\frac{\\tau^a}{2} \\left[ \\gamma_\\mu \\gamma_5 g_A(Q^2) + q_\\mu \\frac{i\\gamma_5}{2m_N} g_P(Q^2) \\right] u(p)\n    $$\n    Here, $u(p)$ and $\\bar{u}(p')$ are nucleon spinors, $m_N$ is the nucleon mass, $\\tau^a$ are the Pauli matrices for isospin, $q = p' - p$ is the momentum transfer, and $Q^2 = -q^2 = -(p'-p)^2$ is the Euclidean momentum transfer squared.

For two light quarks with mass $m_q$, the PCAC relation states that the divergence of the axial current is proportional to the pseudoscalar density:\n    $$\n    \\partial_\\mu A_\\mu^a(x) = 2m_q P^a(x)\n    $$\n    The matrix element of the pseudoscalar density $\\langle N(p')|P^a(0)|N(p)\\rangle$ is known to be dominated by the pion pole. This observation, combined with the definition of the pion decay constant $f_\\pi$ and the pion-nucleon coupling constant $g_{\\pi NN}$, leads to the following model for the matrix element of the divergence of the axial current:\n    $$\n    \\langle N(p') | \\partial_\\mu A_\\mu^a(0) | N(p) \\rangle = - \\frac{f_\\pi g_{\\pi NN} m_\\pi^2}{m_\\pi^2 + Q^2} \\bar{u}(p') i\\gamma_5 \\tau^a u(p)\n    $$\n    Here, $m_\\pi$ is the pion mass and $g_{\\pi NN}$ is the pion-nucleon coupling constant.
