The dominant source of these neutrinos is the decay of pions ($\\pi$) and kaons. However, at higher energies, short-lived charmed mesons ($D$) are also produced, and their prompt decay provides another source of neutrinos.\n\nA key difference between these production channels is the average altitude at which the neutrinos are created. Prompt neutrinos from charmed meson decay are typically generated at a higher average altitude, $h_D$, compared to the conventional neutrinos from pion decay, which are produced at a lower average altitude, $h_\\pi$.
