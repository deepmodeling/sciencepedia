The model includes the Standard Model particle content, three right-handed neutrinos ($N_j$, $j=1,2,3$), and a complex scalar field, the flavon $\\phi$.\n\nThe model is endowed with a global $U(1)_F$ flavor symmetry. The flavon field has a $U(1)_F$ charge $Q_\\phi = -1$. This symmetry is spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the flavon, $\\langle \\phi \\rangle$. The ratio of the VEV to the fundamental flavor scale $\\Lambda_F$ defines a small dimensionless parameter $\\lambda = \\langle \\phi \\rangle / \\Lambda_F \\ll 1$.\n\nIn the effective theory below the scale $\\Lambda_F$, the Yukawa couplings and mass terms are suppressed by powers of $\\lambda$. The power is determined by the $U(1)_F$ charges of the fields involved in the interaction, such that the full operator is invariant. Specifically:\n\n1.  The Dirac neutrino Yukawa coupling, from the operator $\\bar{L}_i \\tilde{H} N_j$, scales as $y_{D,ij} \\sim \\lambda^{|Q_{L_i} + Q_H + Q_{N_j}|}$. Here, $L_i$ are the left-handed lepton doublets, $H$ is the Higgs doublet, and $N_j$ are the right-handed neutrinos. Assume the order-one coefficients are generic and non-zero. The Dirac neutrino mass matrix after electroweak symmetry breaking is $m_D = \\langle H^0 \\rangle y_D$.\n\n2.  The Majorana mass matrix for the right-handed neutrinos, $M_R$, is assumed to be diagonal in the basis where the $N_j$ have definite $U(1)_F$ charges. The mass of the $j$-th right-handed neutrino, from the operator $\\bar{N}_j^c N_j$, scales as $M_{R,j} \\sim \\Lambda_R \\lambda^{2|Q_{N_j}|}$, where $\\Lambda_R$ is a high-energy mass scale.\n\nThe light neutrino mass matrix $m_\\nu$ is generated by the seesaw mechanism: $m_\\nu \\approx -m_D M_R^{-1} m_D^T$.\n\nThe $U(1)_F$ charges of the relevant fields are assigned as follows:\n*   Left-handed electron doublet ($L_e$): $Q_{L_e} = 2$\n*   Left-handed muon doublet ($L_\\mu$): $Q_{L_\\mu} = 1$\n*   Higgs doublet ($H$): $Q_H = 1$\n*   Right-handed neutrinos ($N_1, N_2, N_3$): $Q_{N_1} = -4$, $Q_{N_2} = 0$, $Q_{N_3} = 2$.\n\nAssuming that $\\lambda$ is small and the order-one coefficients do not lead to accidental cancellations, determine the approximate ratio of the electron and muon neutrino mass matrix elements, $(m_\\nu)_{ee} / (m_\\nu)_{\\mu\\mu}$, expressed as a power of $\\lambda$.", "solution": "1.  **Determine the scaling of matrix elements.**\n    From the seesaw formula, $m_\\nu \\approx -m_D M_R^{-1} m_D^T$, the diagonal elements are given by $(m_\\nu)_{ii} = -\\sum_k (m_{D,ik})^2 / M_{R,k}$. The scaling of each term in the sum is determined by the Froggatt-Nielsen charges. The Dirac mass element scaling is $m_{D,ik} \\sim \\lambda^{|Q_{L_i} + Q_H + Q_{N_k}|} = \\lambda^{E_{ik}}$. The heavy Majorana mass scaling is $M_{R,k} \\sim \\lambda^{2|Q_{N_k}|} = \\lambda^{F_k}$. Thus, each term in the sum for $(m_\\nu)_{ii}$ scales as $\\lambda^{2E_{ik} - F_k}$.
