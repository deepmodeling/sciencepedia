This first exercise provides a fundamental bridge between the experimental world of frequencies and the theoretical realm of energy levels. By converting the measured frequency of the $2S_{1/2} - 2P_{1/2}$ splitting in hydrogen into an energy value in electron-volts, you will quantify the scale of this crucial QED effect [@problem_id:2033037].", "problem": "In the relativistic quantum mechanical description of the hydrogen atom, known as the Dirac theory, the energy levels depend only on the principal quantum number $n$ and the total angular momentum quantum number $j$. This implies that states with the same $n$ and $j$ but different orbital angular momentum quantum numbers $l$ should be degenerate. For instance, the $2S_{1/2}$ (where $n=2, l=0, j=1/2$) and $2P_{1/2}$ (where $n=2, l=1, j=1/2$) states are predicted to have the exact same energy. However, experiments conducted by Willis Lamb and Robert Retherford in 1947 revealed that this is not the case. The modern theory of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) explains this discrepancy by accounting for the interaction between the electron and the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. This interaction lifts the degeneracy, causing a small energy difference between the two levels, a phenomenon known as the Lamb shift. Spectroscopic measurements show that the frequency difference corresponding to the transition between the $2S_{1/2}$ and $2P_{1/2}$ states is approximately $f = 1057$ MHz.\n\nGiven the following physical constants:\n- Planck's constant, $h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s}$\n- The elementary charge, $e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ C}$\n\nCalculate the magnitude of this energy split, the Lamb shift, for the $n=2$ states of hydrogen.
