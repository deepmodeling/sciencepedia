The final state consists of an electron with four-momentum $p'$ and a photon with four-momentum $k'$. All external particles are on-shell, which implies the relations $p^2 = p'^2 = m^2$ and $k^2 = k'^2 = 0$. The total four-momentum is conserved, so $p+k = p'+k'$.\n\nThe external electron states are described by on-shell Dirac spinors, $u(p)$ and $\\bar{u}(p')$, which are solutions to the Dirac equation:\n$$(\\not{p} - m)u(p) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\bar{u}(p')(\\not{p}' - m) = 0$$\nwhere we use the Feynman slash notation $\\not{a} \\equiv a_\\mu \\gamma^\\mu$, and $\\gamma^\\mu$ are the Dirac matrices.\n\nThe Feynman amplitude for this process, which relates to the S-matrix element, can be written as $\\mathcal{M} = \\epsilon_{\\nu}^{*}(k') \\mathcal{M}^{\\nu\\mu} \\epsilon_{\\mu}(k)$, where $\\epsilon_{\\mu}(k)$ and $\\epsilon_{\\nu}^{*}(k')$ are the polarization vectors for the incoming and outgoing photons, respectively.

First, simplify the denominators using on-shell conditions ($p^2=m^2$, $k^2=0$):\n$$ (p+k)^2 - m^2 = p^2 + 2p \\cdot k + k^2 - m^2 = 2p \\cdot k $$\n$$ (p-k')^2 - m^2 = p^2 - 2p \\cdot k' + k'^2 - m^2 = -2p \\cdot k' $$\nNow examine the numerators. In the first term, we have the expression $(\\not{p} + \\not{k} + m)\\not{k}$. We can use the identity $\\not{a}\\not{b} = 2a \\cdot b - \\not{b}\\not{a}$ and the Dirac equation $(\\not{p}-m)u(p)=0$, which implies $\\not{p}u(p)=mu(p)$.\n$$ (\\not{p} + \\not{k} + m)\\not{k} u(p) = (\\not{p} + m + \\not{k})\\not{k} u(p) = (2m + \\not{k})\\not{k} u(p) \\quad \\text{is not helpful.} $$\nA better trick is to rewrite $\\not{k}$ as $(\\not{p}+\\not{k}-m) - (\\not{p}-m)$. Since $(\\not{p}-m)u(p)=0$:\n$$ \\not{k} u(p) = (\\not{p}+\\not{k}-m)u(p) $$\nSo, the first numerator becomes:\n$$ (\\not{p} + \\not{k} + m) (\\not{p}+\\not{k}-m) u(p) = ((\\not{p}+\\not{k})^2 - m^2) u(p) = ((p+k)^2 - m^2) u(p) = (2p \\cdot k) u(p) $$\nThus, the first term in the bracket is:\n$$ \\gamma^\\nu \\frac{2p \\cdot k}{2p \\cdot k} u(p) = \\gamma^\\nu u(p) $$\nFor the second term, we do something similar for the spinor $\\bar{u}(p')$.

Use anti-commutation relations: $\\not{k}(\\not{p}-\\not{k}') = 2k \\cdot (p-k') - (\\not{p}-\\not{k}')\\not{k}$.\nLet's use the identity $p-k' = p'-k$.
