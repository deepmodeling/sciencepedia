In the pion's rest frame, the decay products ($\\mu^+$ and $\\nu_\\mu$) move in opposite directions. The initial pion has spin 0, so the final state's total angular momentum must also be 0.

The weak interaction produces a left-handed neutrino ($h=-1/2$), meaning its spin is anti-aligned with its momentum. To keep the total spin zero, the antimuon's spin must also be anti-aligned with its own momentum. Thus, the $\\mu^+$ is also forced into a left-handed state.\n3. The average longitudinal polarization of a massive particle in a pure left-handed state is $P_\\mu = -v/c = -p/E$.
