A key concept governing the emission of soft gluons is color coherence, where a low-energy gluon with a long wavelength interacts with the net color charge of a system of nearby partons. This exercise [@problem_id:181770] explores this fundamental principle in a modern context, using the Soft Drop jet grooming technique to isolate a hard $g \\to q\\bar{q}$ splitting. By calculating the color factor for subsequent soft emission, you will see how the resulting quark-antiquark pair retains the color \"memory\" of the parent gluon, a crucial insight into the structure of gluon jets.", "problem": "In Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the emission of a soft (low-energy) gluon from a collection of hard (high-energy) partons is a fundamental process. The probability of this emission is modulated by a \"color factor\" which depends on the color state of the emitting partons. For a coherent emission, where the gluon's wavelength is large compared to the separation of the emitters, the gluon effectively couples to the total color charge of the system.\n\nConsider a high-energy jet initiated by a gluon in a proton-proton collision. We analyze this jet using the Soft Drop grooming algorithm. This algorithm recursively declusters the jet to identify and remove soft, wide-angle radiation, thereby isolating the primary hard splitting. In this case, the algorithm finds that the hardest splitting in the jet's history is that of the initial gluon into a quark-antiquark pair, $g \\to q\\bar{q}$. The Soft Drop procedure effectively isolates this $q\\bar{q}$ pair as the hard core of the jet.\n\nWe are interested in the subsequent coherent emission of an even softer gluon from this hard $q\\bar{q}$ pair. For a general $SU(N_c)$ color gauge group, the quadratic Casimir operators for the fundamental and adjoint representations are given by $C_F = \\frac{N_c^2-1}{2N_c}$ and $C_A = N_c$, respectively.\n\nCalculate the color factor associated with the coherent emission of a soft gluon from the $q\\bar{q}$ pair produced in this manner.", "solution": "1.

The Lund string model is a widely used phenomenological model for this process. In a simplified iterative picture of quark fragmentation, a quark with light-cone momentum $P_0$ fragments into a hadron and a residual quark.\n\n1.  The first hadron, $h_1$, takes a momentum fraction $z_{(1)}$, so its momentum is $p_1 = z_{(1)}P_0$. The remaining quark, $q_1$, has momentum $P_1 = (1-z_{(1)})P_0$.\n2.  The process repeats: the quark $q_1$ fragments into a second hadron, $h_2$, with momentum $p_2 = z_{(2)}P_1$, and a residual quark $q_2$ with momentum $P_2 = (1-z_{(2)})P_1$.\n3.  The momentum fraction of the second hadron, $z_2$, relative to the *initial* quark momentum $P_0$ is thus $z_2 = p_2/P_0 = z_{(2)}(1-z_{(1)})$.\n\nThe splitting variables $z_{(i)}$ are assumed to be independent random variables drawn from the same probability distribution. A common model for this distribution is based on the Lund symmetric fragmentation function.
