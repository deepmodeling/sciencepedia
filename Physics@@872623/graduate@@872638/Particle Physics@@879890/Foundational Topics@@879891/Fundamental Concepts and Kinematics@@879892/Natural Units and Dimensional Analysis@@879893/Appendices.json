We will use dimensional analysis in natural units where $\\hbar=c=1$.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental constraint that the action $S$ must be dimensionless. The action is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ over spacetime:\n$$S = \\int d^D x \\, \\mathcal{L}$$\nIn natural units, length has mass dimension $[L] = [M]^{-1}$. Therefore, a $D$-dimensional spacetime volume element $d^D x$ has mass dimension $[d^D x] = ([L])^D = ([M]^{-1})^D = [M]^{-D}$.\nSince the action $S$ must be dimensionless, its mass dimension is $[S]=[M]^0$. This implies:\n$$[S] = [d^D x] [\\mathcal{L}] = [M]^{-D} [\\mathcal{L}] = [M]^0$$\nFrom this, we deduce that the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of $[M]^D$:\n$$[\\mathcal{L}] = [M]^D$$\n\nNext, we determine the mass dimension of the scalar field $\\phi$.

The mass dimension of a coupling constant determines the behavior of the theory under renormalization group flow and classifies its renormalizability.\n- If a coupling constant has a positive mass dimension, the interaction is called \"super-renormalizable.\" Its effects become less important at high energies.\n- If a coupling constant has a zero mass dimension (is dimensionless), the interaction is called \"renormalizable.\" Its effects are roughly independent of the energy scale (up to logarithmic corrections).\n- If a coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the interaction is called \"non-renormalizable.\" Its effects become stronger at high energies. In a perturbative expansion, this leads to new, more severe divergences at each order, requiring an infinite number of counterterms to absorb them. Such theories are generally considered not fundamental, as they lose predictive power at high energies.\n\nSince we found that $[\\lambda] = [M]^{-2}$, the coupling constant has a negative mass dimension. Therefore, the $\\phi^6$ interaction in $D=4$ is non-renormalizable.\n\nCombining our findings: the mass dimension of $\\lambda$ is $[M]^{-2}$, and the theory is non-renormalizable.
