This wake provides confinement in the horizontal ($x$) direction.\n\nDue to the complex, asymmetric structure of the ion wakefield, the particle's horizontal and vertical motions are coupled. For small displacements $(x, z)$ from its stable equilibrium position (which we define as the origin), the potential energy of the dust grain can be approximated by:\n$$U(x, z) = \\frac{1}{2} k_x x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k_z z^2 + \\alpha x z$$\nHere, $k_x$ and $k_z$ are the effective spring constants for the horizontal and vertical confinement, respectively.
