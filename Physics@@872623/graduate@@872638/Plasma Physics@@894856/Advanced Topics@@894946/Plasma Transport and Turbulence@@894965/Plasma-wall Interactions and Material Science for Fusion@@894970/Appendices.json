This critical stress is influenced by the intrinsic properties of the crystal lattice and by the presence of defects.\n\nNeutron irradiation from the fusion plasma creates a high density of defects, predominantly in the form of small dislocation loops.

Irradiation has produced a uniform, random distribution of circular dislocation loops of a single diameter $d$ and a volume number density $N$.\n3.
