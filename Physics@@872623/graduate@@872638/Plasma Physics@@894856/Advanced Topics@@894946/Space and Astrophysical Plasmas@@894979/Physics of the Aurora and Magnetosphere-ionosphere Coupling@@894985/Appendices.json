The Pedersen conductivity is dominated by the ion contribution, so we can neglect the electron contribution ($\\sigma_P \\approx \\sigma_{P,i}$).\n2.  The ionosphere is composed of a single ion species with charge $q_i=e$. The ion number density, $n_i$, is constant with altitude.\n3.

The neutral particles have a uniform mass $m_n$ and are subject to a constant gravitational acceleration $g$. The neutral number density at a reference altitude $z=0$ is $n_{n0}$.\n4.  The ion-neutral collision frequency is proportional to the neutral density: $\\nu_{in}(z) = n_n(z) K_{in}$, where $K_{in}$ is a constant rate coefficient.\n5.  The background magnetic field, $\\vec{B}$, is uniform, resulting in a constant ion gyrofrequency $\\Omega_i$.\n\nDerive an expression for the altitude, $z_p$, at which the Pedersen conductivity is maximum.
