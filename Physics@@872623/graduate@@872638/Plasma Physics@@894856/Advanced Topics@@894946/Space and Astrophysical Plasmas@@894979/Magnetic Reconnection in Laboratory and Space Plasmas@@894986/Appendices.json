A key result of the Sweet-Parker model is the scaling relation between the aspect ratio and the Lundquist number: $A = S_L^{1/2}$.\n\nWhen the Lundquist number is very large, the Sweet-Parker sheet becomes unstable to a secondary tearing instability, often called the plasmoid instability. This instability fragments the sheet into a chain of magnetic islands, or plasmoids, separated by shorter, secondary current sheets. A heuristic criterion for the onset of this instability is that the formation time of these plasmoids must be shorter than the time it takes for them to be flushed out of the main current sheet by the Alfvénic outflow.\n\nThe problem requires you to use the following physical model:\n\n1.
