The instrument is designed to measure the energy distribution of hydrogen neutrals emerging from the plasma via charge-exchange events. These neutrals are ionized by a stripping foil, and the resulting protons ($H^+$) are analyzed. The analyzer measures the momentum-to-charge ratio of the ions and is calibrated to report the energy, $E_{app}$, assuming the detected particles have the proton mass, $m_p$, and the elementary charge, $+e$.\n\nThe plasma is contaminated with a small fraction of carbon ions, which are thermalized and have a Maxwellian energy distribution with a temperature $T_C$.

The energy distribution of the flux of these carbon neutrals entering the NPA follows the form $\\Phi_C(E) \\propto \\sqrt{E} \\exp(-E/T_C)$, where $E$ is the true energy of the carbon atom.\n\nA specific artifact arises because some of the incoming carbon neutrals (mass $m_C$) are *doubly* stripped in the foil, producing $C^{2+}$ ions with charge $+2e$.

This problem illustrates the importance of precision in experimental design and how bulk plasma motion can manifest in spectral measurements [@problem_id:288782].", "problem": "A Neutral Particle Analyzer (NPA) is a key diagnostic tool used in fusion research to determine the energy distribution of ions in a plasma. It operates by measuring the energy of fast neutral atoms that are created via charge-exchange (CX) reactions between hot plasma ions and cold background neutral atoms. Since the kinetic energy is largely conserved in a CX reaction, the energy spectrum of the escaping neutrals directly reflects the energy spectrum of the parent ions.\n\nConsider a large-aspect-ratio toroidal plasma, such as in a tokamak, where ions of mass $m_i$ are rotating in the toroidal direction. The plasma has a uniform toroidal angular velocity $\\omega_t$. The velocity distribution of the ions in any local co-rotating frame is an ideal Maxwellian characterized by a temperature $T_i$ (expressed in energy units).\n\nAn NPA is installed with a line-of-sight designed to be perpendicular to the toroidal direction, aiming to measure the ion temperature without complications from the toroidal rotation-induced Doppler shift. However, a slight misalignment causes the NPA's sightline vector, $\\mathbf{\\hat{s}}$, to have a small, non-zero angle $\\delta \\ll 1$ with respect to the local poloidal plane (the plane perpendicular to the toroidal direction). We can assume that the measured CX signal is dominated by ions from a specific, localized region at a major radius $R_m$.\n\nThis misalignment means that a component of the large toroidal velocity is projected onto the NPA sightline, creating an artifactual Doppler shift in the measured energy spectrum. In the limit where the kinetic energy associated with the projected rotational velocity is much smaller than the ion temperature $T_i$, derive the leading-order expression for this artifactual energy shift, $\\Delta E$. This shift is defined as the difference between the peak energy of the measured spectrum and the peak energy that would be measured with a perfectly aligned (non-rotating) sightline.
