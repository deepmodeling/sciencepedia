Before we can explore the complex physics of plasma confinement, we must first understand how to create the necessary magnetic field geometry. This exercise provides a practical starting point, connecting the tangible engineering parameters of a \"choke coil\"—its dimensions and windings—to the crucial physics parameter it's designed to achieve: the mirror ratio $R_m$ [@problem_id:357935]. By working through this problem, you will build a foundational understanding of how magnetic fields are shaped to form the magnetic \"bottle\" that is essential for confinement.", "problem": "A simplified model for a tandem mirror magnetic confinement device consists of a long central solenoid producing a nearly uniform axial magnetic field $B_0$, and two \"choke coils\" at either end to create magnetic mirrors. These mirrors reflect charged particles back into the central confinement region, reducing end losses.\n\nConsider one of these choke coils, modeled as a short solenoid of length $L$ and radius $a$, with a total of $N$ turns of wire. The coil is placed coaxially with the central solenoid, and the current $I$ in its windings flows in the same direction as the current producing the main field $B_0$. The superposition of the fields creates a region of high magnetic field strength, acting as a mirror.\n\nThe effectiveness of this mirror is characterized by the mirror ratio, $R_m$, defined as the ratio of the maximum magnetic field strength on the axis, $B_{max}$, to the minimum field strength, which is the field in the central region, $B_0$. The maximum field occurs at the geometric center of the choke coil.\n\nGiven the uniform background field $B_0$, the choke coil parameters ($L, a, N$), and a desired mirror ratio $R_m$, derive an expression for the required current $I$ that must flow through the choke coil.

The plug is designed to confine a local population of ions, which in turn creates an ambipolar potential barrier that improves the confinement of the main fusion plasma in the central cell.\n\nConsider a simplified, symmetric model of such a plug cell.
