Qubits reside on the edges of this lattice. The code is defined by a set of commuting stabilizer operators. For an infinite lattice, there are two types of stabilizers:\n\n1.  **Star operators ($A_s$):** For each vertex (star) $s$ of the lattice, the operator $A_s$ is the product of Pauli-X operators on the four qubits (edges) incident to that vertex:\n    $$A_s = \\bigotimes_{j \\in \\text{star}(s)} X_j$$\n2.  **Plaquette operators ($B_p$):** For each face (plaquette) $p$ of the lattice, the operator $B_p$ is the product of Pauli-Z operators on the four qubits (edges) that form the boundary of that plaquette:\n    $$B_p = \\bigotimes_{k \\in \\text{plaq}(p)} Z_k$$\n\nA state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is in the codespace if it is a $+$1 eigenstate of all stabilizer operators: $A_s|\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle$ and $B_p|\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle$ for all $s, p$.\n\nAn error $E$ acting on the qubits can cause the state to leave the codespace. This is detected by measuring the eigenvalues of the stabilizers. If an error $E$ anticommutes with a stabilizer $S$ (i.e., $SE = -ES$), the measured eigenvalue of $S$ becomes $-$1, indicating an excitation has been created. A $-$1 eigenvalue for a star operator $A_s$ is called a vertex excitation (or e-type anyon), while a $-$1 eigenvalue for a plaquette operator $B_p$ is called a plaquette excitation (or m-type anyon).\n\nErrors are corrected by applying a correction operator $C$ that returns the system to the codespace. Vertex excitations are remedied by applying a chain of Pauli-X operators, $C_X$, along a path of edges connecting the excited vertices. Plaquette excitations are remedied by applying a chain of Pauli-Z operators, $C_Z$, along a path of edges connecting the excited plaquettes (this path is on the dual lattice). The **weight** of a correction chain is the number of qubits it acts on non-trivially (i.e., its length). The minimum weight correction principle dictates choosing the chain(s) with the smallest possible weight.\n\nConsider a single Pauli-Y error occurring on one data qubit. A Pauli-Y error, which can be expressed as $Y = iXZ$, creates both vertex and plaquette excitations. To correct this error, one must apply both a Pauli-X chain and a Pauli-Z chain.\n\nCalculate the minimum total weight of the Pauli-X and Pauli-Z correction chains required to remedy a single Pauli-Y error on a data qubit. The total weight is the sum of the weight of the minimal X-chain and the weight of the minimal Z-chain.", "solution": "A single Pauli-Y error on a qubit (edge) in the toric code lattice is equivalent to applying both Pauli-X and Pauli-Z operators on that qubit. The Pauli-X component anticommutes with the star operators $A_s$ at the two vertices incident to the edge, creating two vertex excitations. Similarly, the Pauli-Z component anticommutes with the plaquette operators $B_p$ of the two adjacent plaquettes sharing the edge, creating two plaquette excitations.\n\nTo correct the vertex excitations, a minimal Pauli-X chain $C_X$ must connect the two excited vertices. Since the vertices are adjacent (connected by the error edge), the minimal path consists of a single edge. Thus, $C_X$ acts non-trivially on one qubit, and its weight is 1.\n\nTo correct the plaquette excitations, a minimal Pauli-Z chain $C_Z$ must connect the two excited plaquettes on the dual lattice. The two plaquettes share the error edge, so the minimal path on the dual lattice corresponds to a single edge in the original lattice (the error edge). Thus, $C_Z$ acts non-trivially on one qubit, and its weight is 1.\n\nThe total weight is the sum of the weights of $C_X$ and $C_Z$:\n\n$$\n\\text{Total weight} = \\text{weight}(C_X) + \\text{weight}(C_Z) = 1 + 1 = 2\n$$\n\nThis is the minimum total weight, as any other path for either chain would be longer, increasing the total weight.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{2} $$", "id": "1219602"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the concept of error-syndrome pairs, we now tackle a more realistic scenario faced by a decoder.

Qubits are located on the edges of this lattice. The code's stabilizer group is generated by two types of local operators: star operators $A_v = \\bigotimes_{j \\in v} X_j$ for each vertex $v$, and plaquette operators $B_p = \\bigotimes_{j \\in p} Z_j$ for each plaquette $p$. Here, $X_j$ and $Z_j$ are the Pauli-X and Pauli-Z operators acting on the qubit at edge $j$.\n\nAn error-free state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is stabilized by all such operators, meaning $A_v|\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle$ and $B_p|\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle$ for all $v, p$. When errors occur, some stabilizer measurements may yield a $-1$ eigenvalue, indicating a syndrome. Specifically, a Pauli-X error on a single edge $j$ anti-commutes with the two plaquette operators, $B_{p_1}$ and $B_{p_2}$, that share the edge $j$. This creates a pair of \"vortices\" (or m-type anyons) at plaquettes $p_1$ and $p_2$. An error chain consisting of multiple Pauli-X operators creates vortices at the endpoints of the chain.\n\nThe process of error correction involves identifying the most probable error chain that could have caused the measured syndrome configuration. For independent bit-flip errors with low probability, this corresponds to finding the error chain with the minimum \"weight\", defined as the number of qubits (edges) it affects. This is equivalent to finding the shortest paths on the dual lattice that connect the vortices in pairs.\n\nConsider an $L \\times L$ toric code, with $L \\ge 15$.

The weight of the chain is the sum of the distances between the paired vortices.\n\nThe distance between two plaquettes at $(i_1, j_1)$ and $(i_2, j_2)$ on a large lattice (where periodic boundary effects are negligible, as is the case for $L \\geq 15$ given the coordinates) is the Manhattan distance: $d = |i_1 - i_2| + |j_1 - j_2|$.\n\nThere are three possible ways to pair the four vortices:\n1.

Such an operator creates no syndromes.\n\nConsider a scenario where syndrome information is inaccessible in a central, contiguous $k \\times k$ block of plaquettes ($k < L$). Suppose an X-error chain occurs such that all its resulting syndromes lie within this inaccessible region. From the perspective of the error-correction system, which cannot probe this region, no syndromes are detected, and thus no corrective action is taken. However, the error chain itself may be topologically non-trivial, effectively acting as a logical operator.\n\nFind the minimum weight (i.e., the minimum number of single-qubit $X$ operators) of an error chain that acts as a non-trivial logical X-operator wrapping around one of the torus cycles (e.g., horizontally), with the constraint that all its syndromes are located within the central $k \\times k$ inaccessible subgrid of plaquettes.
