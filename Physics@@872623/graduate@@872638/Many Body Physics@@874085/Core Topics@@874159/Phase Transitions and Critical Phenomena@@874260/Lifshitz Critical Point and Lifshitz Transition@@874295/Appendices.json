For this system, such a transition can occur at half-filling, where the Fermi level is typically pinned to the energy of the saddle points in the band structure. These saddle points are located at the $X$ points of the first Brillouin zone, e.g., $\\mathbf{k}_X = (\\pi/a, 0)$ and $(0, \\pi/a)$. As the ratio $t'/t$ is varied, the curvature of the band structure at these saddle points can change, leading to a modification of the Fermi surface topology.\n\nDetermine the critical value of the ratio $t'/t$ at which this Lifshitz transition occurs.
