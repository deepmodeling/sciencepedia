The particles have permanent dipole moments, which are all aligned along the $z$-axis by an external field. The system forms a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with a uniform density of condensed atoms $n_0$.\n\nThe dynamics of the system can be described using the single-particle Green's function, $G(x, x')$, where $x = (\\mathbf{r}, t)$. The equation of motion for $G$ is the first equation in the Martin-Schwinger hierarchy. In the Hartree-Fock approximation, the two-particle Green's function $G_2$ is decoupled, leading to a closed equation for $G$. This results in a Dyson-like equation, $G^{-1} = G_0^{-1} - \\Sigma_{HF}$, where $G_0$ is the non-interacting Green's function and $\\Sigma_{HF}$ is the Hartree-Fock self-energy.\n\nFor a particle excitation with momentum $\\hbar\\mathbf{k}$ above the condensate, the self-energy within this approximation represents the particle's interaction energy with the condensate background. It consists of a direct (Hartree) term and an exchange (Fock) term. For a general particle distribution $n(\\mathbf{p})$, the self-energy is given by:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{HF}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\int d^3p \\, \\tilde{V}(\\mathbf{q}=0) n(\\mathbf{p}) + \\int d^3p \\, \\tilde{V}(\\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{p}) n(\\mathbf{p})\n$$\nwhere $\\tilde{V}(\\mathbf{q})$ is the Fourier transform of the two-body interaction potential. For a pure BEC at $T=0$, the particle distribution is sharply peaked at zero momentum, i.e., $n(\\mathbf{p}) = n_0\\delta^{(3)}(\\mathbf{p})$.\n\nThe interaction potential in this system is modeled by the sum of a local contact interaction and the dipole-dipole interaction. Its Fourier transform is given by:\n$$\n\\tilde{V}(\\mathbf{q}) = g + U_d \\left(3\\frac{q_z^2}{|\\mathbf{q}|^2} - 1\\right)\n$$\nwhere $g$ and $U_d$ are constants representing the strengths of the contact and dipolar interactions, respectively. Due to the long-range nature of the dipolar interaction, its momentum-space representation at $\\mathbf{q}=0$ is sensitive to the system's geometry. You are to assume a geometry for which the contribution of the dipolar part to the direct (Hartree) term averages to zero, i.e., the term proportional to $U_d$ does not contribute to $\\tilde{V}(\\mathbf{q}=0)$.\n\nUsing the provided information, calculate the Hartree-Fock self-energy $\\Sigma_{HF}(\\mathbf{k})$ for a particle excitation of momentum $\\hbar\\mathbf{k}$.
