The elementary excitations are not electrons, but rather collective modes: spinons, which carry the electron's spin ($s=1/2$) but no charge, and holons, which carry the electron's charge but no spin ($s=0$). A holon can be thought of as a 'hole' created by removing an electron, and thus it carries a charge of $q=+e$, where $e$ is the elementary charge.\n\nConsider a single holon injected into a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The interferometer consists of two 50/50 non-polarizing beam splitters (BS1 and BS2) and two arms of equal effective path length. Two detectors, D1 and D2, are placed at the output ports of BS2. The interferometer is initially configured such that with no external fields, any holon entering the interferometer is always detected at D1. This corresponds to perfect constructive interference at detector D1 and perfect destructive interference at detector D2.\n\nA long, thin magnetic solenoid is then placed between the two arms, oriented perpendicularly to the plane of the interferometer. This creates a total magnetic flux $\\Phi$ through the area enclosed by the two arms. The magnetic field is perfectly confined within the solenoid, so the holon does not experience any magnetic field (and thus no Lorentz force) along its classical paths.\n\nYour task is to determine the minimum positive value of the magnetic flux, $\\Phi_{min}$, that must be applied to shift the interference pattern such that the holon is now always detected at detector D2.
