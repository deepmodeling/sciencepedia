## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Having established the theoretical foundations of the Popov approximation and its formulation as a hydrodynamic action, we now turn to its application in diverse physical contexts. The true power of a theoretical framework is revealed not only in its internal consistency but also in its ability to predict, describe, and unify a wide range of observable phenomena. This chapter will demonstrate how the principles developed previously provide a robust and versatile tool for understanding the rich physics of weakly interacting Bose gases.

We will explore how the Popov theory quantitatively describes the hallmark properties of [superfluidity](@entry_id:146323), such as dissipationless flow and the nature of [long-range order](@entry_id:155156). We will then delve into the world of topological defects, particularly [quantized vortices](@entry_id:147055), examining their static interactions and dynamic excitations. The framework will be further extended to the realm of [non-equilibrium physics](@entry_id:143186), where we will see how scattering between the system's elementary excitations gives rise to macroscopic [transport coefficients](@entry_id:136790) like viscosity. Finally, we will venture to the frontiers of modern research, applying the theory to multi-component mixtures, [spinor condensates](@entry_id:161233), and systems with long-range or synthetic interactions, showcasing its vital role in the ongoing exploration of novel [quantum matter](@entry_id:162104).

### Macroscopic Quantum Phenomena and Collective Excitations

The Popov approximation provides direct access to the elementary [excitation spectrum](@entry_id:139562) of a Bose gas, which in turn governs its most fundamental macroscopic quantum behaviors. The very existence of [superfluidity](@entry_id:146323), the nature of quantum order, and the [propagation of sound](@entry_id:194493) are all encoded within the dynamics of these low-energy quasiparticles.

#### Superfluidity and Critical Velocity

One of the defining features of a superfluid is its ability to flow without dissipation below a certain [critical velocity](@entry_id:161155). Landau's phenomenological criterion provides a direct link between this macroscopic property and the microscopic [excitation spectrum](@entry_id:139562), $\epsilon(p)$. Superfluidity is stable as long as it is not energetically favorable to create an elementary excitation in the fluid. This condition sets an upper bound on the flow velocity, the Landau critical velocity $v_c$, given by $v_c = \min_{p>0} [\epsilon(p)/p]$.

For a weakly interacting Bose gas in three dimensions, the Popov approximation yields the Bogoliubov [dispersion relation](@entry_id:138513) $\epsilon(p) = \sqrt{(\frac{p^2}{2m})^2 + 2\mu(\frac{p^2}{2m})}$, where $\mu$ is the chemical potential. The ratio $\epsilon(p)/p$ is a monotonically increasing function of momentum $p$. Its minimum value therefore occurs in the limit $p \to 0$. In this long-wavelength limit, the dispersion becomes linear, $\epsilon(p) \approx c_s p$, where $c_s = \sqrt{\mu/m}$ is the speed of sound. Consequently, the Landau critical velocity is precisely this speed of sound, $v_c = c_s$. Using the mean-field expression for the chemical potential, $\mu = 4\pi\hbar^2 n a_s/m$, we find that the [critical velocity](@entry_id:161155) is determined by the fundamental parameters of the gas: its density $n$, particle mass $m$, and [s-wave scattering length](@entry_id:142891) $a_s$ [@problem_id:1181537]. This result beautifully illustrates how a macroscopic quantum phenomenon—dissipationless flow—is dictated by the collective sound mode of the system.

#### Correlation Functions and Dimensionality

While a three-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate exhibits true long-range order, this is a special case. In lower dimensions, enhanced quantum fluctuations, which are accurately captured by the Popov hydrodynamic action, fundamentally alter the nature of the ordered state. The phase field $\theta(\mathbf{r})$ is not long-range ordered, and this has profound consequences for correlation functions.

The one-body [correlation function](@entry_id:137198), $G(\mathbf{r}) = \langle \hat{\psi}^\dagger(\mathbf{r}) \hat{\psi}(0) \rangle \propto \langle e^{-i[\hat{\theta}(\mathbf{r}) - \hat{\theta}(0)]} \rangle$, serves as a direct probe of this order. In both one and two dimensions at zero temperature, the fluctuations of the phase field are so strong that they destroy true long-range order, meaning $G(\mathbf{r})$ does not approach a constant at large distances. Instead, it decays to zero as a power law, $G(\mathbf{r}) \sim |\mathbf{r}|^{-\eta}$. This behavior is known as [quasi-long-range order](@entry_id:145141).

The hydrodynamic action allows for a direct calculation of the decay exponent $\eta$. In two dimensions, the low-energy physics is governed by a phase-only action $S_E \propto \int d^2r (\nabla\theta)^2$. A calculation of the phase fluctuations reveals that the exponent $\eta$ is inversely proportional to the [superfluid stiffness](@entry_id:147718), which encapsulates the energy cost of phase gradients. This [power-law decay](@entry_id:262227) is a central feature of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) theory of 2D superfluids [@problem_id:1181576].

In one dimension, the hydrodynamic action describes a system known as a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. Here, after integrating out the [density fluctuations](@entry_id:143540), one obtains an [effective action](@entry_id:145780) for the phase field that leads to a similar [power-law decay](@entry_id:262227) of correlations. The decay exponent is found to be inversely proportional to the dimensionless Luttinger parameter $K$, which is a function of the sound velocity and compressibility of the gas. This result, $\eta = 1/(2K)$, is a cornerstone of Luttinger liquid theory, demonstrating that the 1D interacting Bose gas is a physical realization of this fascinating state of matter [@problem_id:1181536].

#### The Structure of Hydrodynamic Fluctuations

The hydrodynamic action for density and phase fluctuations reveals their fundamental relationship. The action contains a term of the form $\int d\tau d\mathbf{x} \, i \delta n (\partial_\tau \theta)$, which indicates that the density fluctuation $\delta n$ and the phase $\theta$ are canonically [conjugate variables](@entry_id:147843). Their dynamics are intimately coupled.

Despite this coupling, certain correlations may vanish due to underlying symmetries. For instance, the equal-time [cross-correlation function](@entry_id:147301) $\langle \delta n(\mathbf{x}) \theta(0) \rangle$ is identically zero in the ground state. This can be shown by a direct calculation using the [path integral formalism](@entry_id:138631), where the frequency integral involved vanishes because the integrand is an [odd function](@entry_id:175940). More physically, this result can be understood from time-reversal symmetry. The ground state is time-reversal invariant. Under [time reversal](@entry_id:159918), the density operator $\delta n$ is even, whereas the phase operator $\theta$ is odd (since the superfluid velocity $\mathbf{v}_s \propto \nabla\theta$ must reverse direction). The [expectation value](@entry_id:150961) of an operator product that is odd under a symmetry of the state must be zero [@problem_id:1181477].

The collective modes themselves—the phonons—have a velocity determined by the underlying interactions. Even for complex, non-local interaction potentials, the sound velocity $u = \lim_{q\to0} \omega(q)/|q|$ depends only on the long-wavelength ($q \to 0$) limit of the interaction potential in Fourier space, $U(q=0)$. This general principle holds true and can be demonstrated by deriving the equations of motion for the coupled density and phase fields for an arbitrary interaction $U(q)$ [@problem_id:1181538].

### Topological Defects: Vortices in Superfluids

Beyond smooth, wavelike excitations, superfluids can host topological defects. In a Bose-Einstein condensate, the most fundamental of these are [quantized vortices](@entry_id:147055), which are line defects around which the phase of the condensate wavefunction winds by an integer multiple of $2\pi$. The Popov framework, especially in its mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii limit, is an indispensable tool for studying the structure and dynamics of these vortices.

#### Static Properties and Interactions

The presence of a defect, whether it is a vortex or simply a static impurity potential, perturbs the uniform condensate. The condensate wavefunction must "heal" back to its bulk value over a characteristic distance. This distance, the [healing length](@entry_id:139128) $\xi = \hbar/\sqrt{2m\mu}$, emerges naturally from the theory. When a weak, point-like impurity is placed in a 3D condensate, the Popov (Gross-Pitaevskii) equation can be linearized to find the density perturbation it induces. The solution shows that the density is depleted near a repulsive impurity, with the perturbation decaying away from the defect. At long distances, this decay takes the form of a [screened potential](@entry_id:193863), $\delta n_0(r) \propto \exp(-\sqrt{2}r/\xi)/r$, which is a Yukawa-type potential with a range determined by the [healing length](@entry_id:139128) [@problem_id:1181489].

The interactions between vortices themselves are also described by the hydrodynamic action. In a 2D superfluid, the energy of a static configuration is determined entirely by the spatial gradients of the phase field, $E = \int \frac{K}{2}(\nabla\theta)^2 d^2r$. For a vortex-antivortex pair separated by a distance $d$ (much larger than the core size $a$), one can calculate this energy. The result is a potential that grows logarithmically with separation, $U(d) = 2\pi K \ln(d/a)$, where $K$ is the [superfluid stiffness](@entry_id:147718). This logarithmic potential implies a long-range attractive force between the vortex and antivortex, a crucial ingredient for the BKT transition where vortex-antivortex pairs unbind at a critical temperature [@problem_id:1181553].

#### Vortex Dynamics

Vortices are not merely static objects; they are dynamic entities with their own unique excitations. The hydrodynamic action allows us to study their motion and [emergent properties](@entry_id:149306). One such property is an effective [inertial mass](@entry_id:267233). When a vortex line moves through the superfluid, the surrounding superflow field must move with it. The kinetic energy stored in this flow field can be identified with the kinetic energy of a massive object, $\frac{1}{2}\mathcal{M}v^2$. By calculating the kinetic energy term $(\partial_t \theta)^2$ in the Popov action for a slowly moving vortex, one can extract this [inertial mass](@entry_id:267233) per unit length, $\mathcal{M}$. The calculation reveals that, like the static interaction energy, the mass depends logarithmically on the system size, $\mathcal{M} \propto \ln(R/\xi)$, where $R$ and $\xi$ are long- and short-distance cutoffs, respectively [@problem_id:1181615].

A vortex line is also not required to be rigid. It can bend and oscillate. These transverse oscillations are themselves quantized collective modes known as Kelvin waves. An [effective action](@entry_id:145780) for the displacement of the vortex line can be derived from the underlying Popov action. This effective theory includes a gyroscopic term arising from the Magnus force and a [line tension](@entry_id:271657) term from the energy cost of bending the vortex. The [line tension](@entry_id:271657) itself has a logarithmic dependence on the wavevector of the bending, $T(k_z) \propto \ln(1/(k_z\xi))$. Solving the [equations of motion](@entry_id:170720) for these displacements yields the dispersion relation for Kelvin waves, $\omega(k_z) \propto k_z^2 \ln(1/(k_z\xi))$. These helical waves are a fundamental excitation of a turbulent superfluid and play a key role in the [dissipation of energy](@entry_id:146366) at low temperatures [@problem_id:1181482].

### Transport Properties and Non-Equilibrium Physics

The Popov approximation describes the ground state and low-energy elementary excitations of a system at equilibrium. However, by considering the interactions *between* these excitations, the framework can be extended to describe [non-equilibrium phenomena](@entry_id:198484) and to compute macroscopic [transport coefficients](@entry_id:136790) that govern how a system responds to external gradients and returns to equilibrium.

#### Viscosity from Quasiparticle Scattering

In a dilute gas of phonons (the low-momentum limit of Bogoliubov quasiparticles), [transport properties](@entry_id:203130) like viscosity arise from collisions between the phonons. Kinetic theory provides a bridge between these microscopic scattering processes and macroscopic fluid dynamics. The shear viscosity, $\eta$, which characterizes the fluid's resistance to shear flow, can be expressed as an integral over the phonon [momentum distribution](@entry_id:162113), weighted by the phonon relaxation time $\tau_k$.

In a 2D Bose gas, the dominant scattering mechanism at low temperatures is the three-phonon process. Using a calculated form for the relaxation rate, $1/\tau_k \propto k^3$, one can evaluate the kinetic theory integral for $\eta$. The calculation shows that the [shear viscosity](@entry_id:141046) is determined by the parameters of the [phonon gas](@entry_id:147597) (sound speed $c$) and the underlying fluid (density $n_0$, particle mass $m$), and it is inversely proportional to the strength of the phonon-[phonon interactions](@entry_id:192021) [@problem_id:1181486].

Bulk viscosity, $\zeta$, is another important transport coefficient, related to dissipation during uniform compression or expansion. Unlike shear viscosity, which arises from momentum-relaxing collisions, [bulk viscosity](@entry_id:187773) is generated by processes that do not conserve the number of quasiparticles. In a 2D Bose gas, the dominant number-changing process at low temperatures is collinear three-[phonon scattering](@entry_id:140674). By calculating the total rate of these number-changing collisions and relating it to $\zeta$ via a thermodynamic formula involving the Grüneisen parameter, one can determine the bulk viscosity. This calculation demonstrates a different physical origin and temperature dependence for this dissipative coefficient [@problem_id:1181515].

#### Non-dissipative Transport: Hall Viscosity

Not all transport coefficients are dissipative. Hall viscosity, $\eta_H$, is a non-dissipative component of the viscosity tensor that can appear in fluids with broken time-reversal symmetry, such as a superfluid in a rotating frame. It gives rise to a stress perpendicular to the [rate of strain](@entry_id:267998), analogous to how the Hall effect gives rise to a voltage perpendicular to the current.

One can investigate this phenomenon by considering a 2D superfluid in a [rotating frame](@entry_id:155637) and calculating the anisotropic part of the fluid's stress tensor, $\langle T_{xx} - T_{yy} \rangle$. In the mean-field Popov description, the ground state in a slowly [rotating frame](@entry_id:155637) corresponds to a uniform density and a velocity field describing [solid-body rotation](@entry_id:191086). When the stress tensor is evaluated in this state, the anisotropic part is found to be of order $\Omega_z^2$, where $\Omega_z$ is the rotation frequency. Since the Hall viscosity is defined as the coefficient of the term linear in $\Omega_z$, this implies that within this simple mean-field model, the Hall viscosity is zero. This provides an important baseline result; non-zero Hall viscosity in superfluids requires more complex physics beyond this description, such as the presence of a dense [vortex lattice](@entry_id:140837) or more intricate ground states [@problem_id:1181543].

### Interdisciplinary Frontiers: Multi-component and Exotic Superfluids

The Popov-Bogoliubov formalism is not limited to simple, single-component [superfluids](@entry_id:180718). Its power and flexibility are particularly evident when applied to the more complex and exotic [quantum gases](@entry_id:162017) that are at the forefront of modern [atomic physics](@entry_id:140823) research. These systems provide a rich playground for exploring phenomena with connections to [condensed matter](@entry_id:747660) physics, particle physics, and quantum information.

#### Bose-Einstein Condensate Mixtures

A natural extension is to a system with two distinct components, such as a mixture of two different atomic species or two hyperfine states of the same atom. The Popov-Bogoliubov analysis of a symmetric two-component BEC reveals two fundamental types of collective sound-like modes. The first is an in-phase or "density" mode, where the two components oscillate in unison, analogous to the single sound mode of a one-component gas. Its sound speed, $c_d$, depends on the sum of the intra-species ($g$) and inter-species ($g_{12}$) interaction strengths [@problem_id:1181546].

The second, more interesting mode is the out-of-phase or "spin" mode, where one component's density increases as the other's decreases. This mode's velocity, $c_{spin}$, depends on the *difference* between the interaction strengths, $g - g_{12}$ [@problem_id:1181569]. This has a crucial physical consequence: if the inter-species repulsion $g_{12}$ becomes larger than the intra-species repulsion $g$, the spin-mode velocity becomes imaginary. An imaginary velocity signifies a dynamical instability. This instability marks a quantum phase transition from a miscible phase, where the two components are mixed, to an immiscible phase, where they phase-separate into distinct domains. External fields, such as a Rabi coupling that drives transitions between the two components, can counteract this tendency to phase-separate, shifting the critical [interaction strength](@entry_id:192243) required for the transition [@problem_id:1181590].

#### Spinor Condensates and Synthetic Gauge Fields

The framework can be applied to systems with even more internal degrees of freedom, such as spin-1 BECs. In the "polar" ground state of such a system (where all atoms occupy the $m_s=0$ magnetic sublevel), the elementary excitations include transverse spin-waves. A Bogoliubov analysis shows that these spin-wave excitations can be gapped, meaning they have a finite energy even at zero momentum. This gap depends on both the spin-dependent interaction strength and an external quadratic Zeeman field, providing a direct handle to tune the magnetic [excitation spectrum](@entry_id:139562) of the quantum fluid [@problem_id:1181588].

The versatility of the Popov approach is also highlighted in systems with anisotropic or synthetic interactions. In a BEC of dipolar atoms, the long-range and anisotropic nature of the [dipole-dipole interaction](@entry_id:139864) is directly imprinted onto the collective [excitation spectrum](@entry_id:139562). The sound velocity becomes direction-dependent, reflecting the symmetry of the underlying interactions and the orientation of the polarizing field [@problem_id:1181488].

Even more strikingly, [synthetic gauge fields](@entry_id:139303) created with laser-atom interactions can fundamentally alter the system's dynamics. In a 2D BEC with Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling, the ground state itself can break [translational symmetry](@entry_id:171614), forming a "plane-wave" phase with a finite momentum condensate. The hydrodynamic theory for this exotic ground state reveals a highly [anisotropic sound](@entry_id:158017) propagation. The sound velocity depends strongly on the direction of propagation relative to the condensate momentum, a direct consequence of the broken Galilean and rotational symmetries imposed by the spin-orbit coupling [@problem_id:1181613].

These examples underscore the power of the Popov approximation and its hydrodynamic action not just as a theory for simple superfluids, but as a foundational tool for exploring and understanding the vast landscape of [emergent phenomena](@entry_id:145138) in complex [quantum matter](@entry_id:162104).
