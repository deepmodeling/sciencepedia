The transport through the QPC at zero temperature is characterized by ballistic electrons moving through transverse energy subbands. The electrical conductance $G$ is given by the Landauer formula, $G = \\frac{e^2}{h} \\sum_i T_i$, where $e$ is the elementary charge, $h$ is Planck's constant, and $T_i$ is the transmission probability for the $i$-th conducting channel. For an ideal QPC, the transmission probability for a channel is unity if its minimum energy is below the Fermi energy $E_F$, and zero otherwise.\n\nInitially, no external magnetic field is present. The gate voltage of the QPC is tuned such that the Fermi energy $E_F$ of the electrons is an amount $\\delta E$ above the energy minimum of the first spin-degenerate transverse subband, $E_1$. That is, $E_F = E_1 + \\delta E$. Assume that $\\delta E$ is small enough so that only this first subband is occupied.\n\nA uniform magnetic field $B$ is then applied parallel to the direction of electron transport through the QPC.
