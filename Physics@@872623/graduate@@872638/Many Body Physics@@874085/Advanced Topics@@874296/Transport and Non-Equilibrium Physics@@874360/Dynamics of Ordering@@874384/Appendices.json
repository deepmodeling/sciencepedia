It is then rapidly quenched below a critical temperature to a triple point, where the three ordered phases, rich in A, B, or C respectively, are thermodynamically equivalent and can coexist.\n\nFollowing the quench, the system undergoes phase separation, forming a cellular network of domains of the three phases. The interfaces separating the domains have a constant surface tension $\\sigma$. The system evolves to minimize its total free energy, which is dominated by the total length of these interfaces. This coarsening process is characterized by a single typical length scale, $L(t)$, representing the average domain size at time $t$.\n\nCrucially, the total amount of each component in the alloy is conserved. At the temperature of the triple point, it is observed that material transport occurs predominantly through diffusion along the interfaces, with bulk diffusion being negligible.
