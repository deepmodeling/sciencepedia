Second, we will substitute the given numerical values to find the final answer.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation**\n\nA quantum dot is capacitively coupled to a source, a drain, and a gate, with respective capacitances $C_{s}$, $C_{d}$, and $C_{g}$. The total capacitance of the quantum dot is the sum of the individual capacitances:\n$$C_{\\Sigma} = C_{g} + C_{s} + C_{d}$$\nThe electrostatic energy of the dot with $N$ excess electrons, $E(N)$, can be expressed as a function of the gate voltage $V_g$:\n$$E(N, V_g) = \\frac{(-Ne + C_g V_g)^2}{2C_\\Sigma} = \\frac{e^2}{2C_\\Sigma}\\left(N - \\frac{C_g V_g}{e}\\right)^2$$\nWe can define the charging energy as $E_C = e^2 / (2C_\\Sigma)$ and the dimensionless gate-induced charge as $n_g = C_g V_g / e$. The energy becomes $E(N, V_g) = E_C(N - n_g)^2$. Any energy terms independent of $N$ have been omitted, as they do not affect the electrochemical potential.\n\nThe electrochemical potential $\\mu(N)$ is the energy required to add the $N$-th electron to the dot:\n$$\\mu(N) \\equiv E(N) - E(N-1)$$\nUsing our expression for $E(N, V_g)$:\n$$\\mu(N, V_g) = E_C\\left[(N - n_g)^2 - (N - 1 - n_g)^2\\right]$$\nExpanding the squares and simplifying:\n$$\\mu(N, V_g) = E_C\\left[(N^2 - 2Nn_g + n_g^2) - ((N-1)^2 - 2(N-1)n_g + n_g^2)\\right]$$\n$$\\mu(N, V_g) = E_C\\left[N^2 - (N-1)^2 - 2n_g(N - (N-1))\\right] = E_C[2N-1 - 2n_g]$$\nWe identify the gate lever arm $\\alpha$ as the dimensionless ratio $\\alpha = C_{g}/C_{\\Sigma}$.

Since $V_s=V_d=0$, we take the leads' chemical potential as our energy reference, $\\mu_{leads}=0$. The peak for the $N-1 \\leftrightarrow N$ transition occurs at gate voltage $V_{g,N}$ where $\\mu(N, V_{g,N}) = 0$.

In the constant-interaction model, this corresponds to the energy spacing between consecutive charge degeneracy points, which we found to be $e^2/C_\\Sigma$.
