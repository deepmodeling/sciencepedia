This derivation is a standard procedure and can be executed rigorously.\n\nLet $P_s(t)$ be the probability that the tagged cluster has size $s$ at time $t$, where $s$ is an integer. The dynamics are governed by single-monomer attachment and detachment events. A cluster of size $s$ can increase to size $s+1$ with rate $W_{+}(s) = a(s)c_1$, or decrease to size $s-1$ with rate $W_{-}(s) = b(s)$.

The probability distribution over discrete sizes, $P_s(t)$, is replaced by a probability density function, $P(s,t)$. The core of the approximation lies in the fact that the cluster size changes by a small, discrete step, $\\Delta s = \\pm 1$.
