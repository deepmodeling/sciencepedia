Independence of Constraints**\n\nWe must check if these three constraints are independent. We can do this by multiplying the three gauge operators together. Since Pauli operators on different links commute, and $(\\sigma_l^x)^2 = \\mathbb{I}_l$ (the identity on link $l$), we have:\n$$\nG_1 G_2 G_3 = (\\sigma_1^x \\sigma_3^x) (\\sigma_1^x \\sigma_2^x) (\\sigma_2^x \\sigma_3^x) = (\\sigma_1^x)^2 (\\sigma_2^x)^2 (\\sigma_3^x)^2 = \\mathbb{I} \\otimes \\mathbb{I} \\otimes \\mathbb{I} = \\mathbb{I}_{\\text{total}}\n$$\nThis result, $G_1 G_2 G_3 = \\mathbb{I}$, shows that the operators are not independent. For example, $G_3 = G_1 G_2$. If a state satisfies the constraints for $G_1$ and $G_2$, it automatically satisfies the constraint for $G_3$:\n$$\nG_3 |\\psi\\rangle = (G_1 G_2) |\\psi\\rangle = G_1 (G_2 |\\psi\\rangle) = G_1 |\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle\n$$\nTherefore, there are only two independent constraints.

Dimension of the Physical Subspace**\n\nEach independent gauge constraint projects the Hilbert space onto the $+1$ eigenspace of the corresponding gauge operator. Since each $G_v$ is Hermitian and squares to the identity, its eigenvalues are $\\pm 1$. The trace of any non-trivial $G_v$ is zero, implying that its $+1$ and $-1$ eigenspaces have equal dimension. Thus, each constraint halves the dimension of the space it acts upon.\n\nWe start with the total dimension $\\dim(\\mathcal{H}_{\\text{total}}) = 2^{N_l}$.
