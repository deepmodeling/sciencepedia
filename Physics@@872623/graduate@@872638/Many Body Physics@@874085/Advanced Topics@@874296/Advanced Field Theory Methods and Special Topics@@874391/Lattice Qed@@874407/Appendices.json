Gauge fields are represented by unitary operators $U_\\ell$ on the links $\\ell$ of the lattice, and electric fields by operators $E_\\ell$ which are their conjugate momenta. In the strong-coupling limit ($g \\gg 1$), the dynamics are dominated by the electric part of the Hamiltonian:\n$$\nH = \\frac{g^2}{2a} \\sum_{\\ell} E_\\ell^2\n$$\nwhere $g$ is the coupling constant.

A plaquette operator $U_p$ is the path-ordered product of link operators around an elementary square $p$. A static magnetic monopole is a source of magnetic flux. While a true monopole is a complex object, we can study the energy of localized magnetic-flux structures as a proxy.\n\nConsider a simple state that models the intersection of two magnetic flux loops. Let $p_1$ be the plaquette in the $xy$-plane with a corner at the origin $(0,0,0)$ and spanning the square defined by vertices $(0,0,0), (a,0,0), (a,a,0), (0,a,0)$. Let $p_2$ be the plaquette in the $xz$-plane also with a corner at the origin and spanning vertices $(0,0,0), (a,0,0), (a,0,a), (0,0,a)$. These two plaquettes are orthogonal and share a single link along the $x$-axis.\n\nAn excited state $|\\Psi\\rangle$ is created by applying the product of these two plaquette operators to the vacuum:\n$$\n|\\Psi\\rangle = U_{p_1} U_{p_2} |0\\rangle\n$$\n\nCalculate the energy $E$ of this state $|\\Psi\\rangle$ in the strong-coupling limit.

To evaluate this, we use the commutation relation between the electric field operator $E_\\ell$ and a plaquette operator $U_p$. A plaquette operator $U_p$ is a product of four link operators. Using $[E_\\ell, U_{\\ell'}] = \\delta_{\\ell, \\ell'} U_{\\ell'}$, we find that $E_\\ell$ commutes with $U_p$ unless the link $\\ell$ is part of the plaquette $p$.\n    If $\\ell \\in p$, then $[E_\\ell, U_p] = n_p(\\ell) U_p$, where $n_p(\\ell) = +1$ if $\\ell$ is traversed in the positive direction within $p$ and $-1$ if in the negative direction. This gives the relation: $E_\\ell U_p = U_p (E_\\ell + n_p(\\ell))$.\n    Let $V = U_{p_1} U_{p_2}$. The total \"winding number\" for a link $\\ell$ is $N_\\ell = n_{p_1}(\\ell) + n_{p_2}(\\ell)$.

The total energy is $E = \\frac{g^2}{2a} \\sum_{\\ell} N_\\ell^2$. We now sum the contributions from all links.
