Consider a wire with $N$ transverse conducting channels at the Fermi energy. Let $L$ be the length of a segment of the wire and $l_b$ be the intrinsic elastic mean free path for backscattering. We define a dimensionless length $\\ell = L/l_b$ and a dimensionless diffusion coefficient $d(\\ell) = D(L)/D_0$, where $D(L)$ is the diffusion coefficient for a segment of length $L$ and $D_0$ is the bare (classical) diffusion coefficient.\n\nA simplified model within the self-consistent theory, valid for a large number of channels ($N \\gg 1$), yields the following equation for the dimensionless diffusion coefficient $d(\\ell)$:\n$$ d(\\ell) = 1 - \\frac{1}{N} \\frac{\\ell}{d(\\ell)} $$\nThe localization length, $\\xi_N$, is defined as the characteristic physical length $L$ at which electronic transport ceases to be diffusive.
