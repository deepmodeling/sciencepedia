These states are degenerate with energy $E_0=0$. Any state with a doubly-occupied site is an excited state with energy at least $U$. These form the excited manifold $\\mathcal{Q}$.\n\nThe effective Hamiltonian for the low-energy manifold is given by $H_{eff} = P_0 V \\frac{1}{E_0 - H_0} Q V P_0$. The first-order term $P_0 V P_0$ is zero because hopping necessarily creates a doubly-occupied site, taking any state out of $\\mathcal{P}_0$. The energy denominator for the second-order term is $E_0 - U = -U$.\n\nLet's focus on two adjacent sites, $i$ and $i+1$. The spin states can be singlets or triplets.\nIf the spins are parallel (e.g., $|\\uparrow_i \\uparrow_{i+1}\\rangle$), the Pauli exclusion principle prevents hopping, so the perturbation has no effect. The energy of these triplet states remains 0.\n\nIf the spins are antiparallel, virtual hopping can occur. Let's find the effective Hamiltonian matrix on the basis $\\{|\\uparrow_i, \\downarrow_{i+1}\\rangle, |\\downarrow_i, \\uparrow_{i+1}\\rangle\\}$. An electron can hop from site $i$ to $i+1$ and back, or vice versa.

The singlet state is lowered in energy by $4t^2/U$ relative to the triplet states (whose energies are all 0 at this order). This energy difference, $E_T - E_S = 4t^2/U$, defines the strength of the antiferromagnetic coupling.\nThe effective Hamiltonian can be written in terms of spin operators $\\vec{S}_i$ as $H_{eff} = J \\sum_i \\vec{S}_i \\cdot \\vec{S}_{i+1} + \\text{const}$.

Neighbors are 3 B-sites ($n_B=1$) and 3 C-sites ($n_C=0$). Interaction changes from $3V(2)(1)=6V$ to $3V(1)(1)=3V$. Change is $-3V$. Total gain $= U+3V$.\n    - Remove from B-site ($n_B=1 \\to 0$): Gain is from V only. Neighbors are 3 A-sites ($n_A=2$) and 3 C-sites ($n_C=0$). Interaction changes from $3V(1)(2)=6V$ to 0. Gain $= 6V$.\n    - The system will lose an electron from the state that costs least energy. This corresponds to the largest energy gain. $\\mu_- = E(N)-E(N-1)$. So the energy of the final state is lowest. Removing an electron from A gives a final energy of $E_{CO} - (U+3V)$. Removing from B gives $E_{CO} - 6V$. So the energy cost to remove an electron is $\\mu_- = \\min(U+3V, 6V)$.\n- At the transition $U=3V$:\n    - $\\mu_+ = \\min(9V, 3V+6V) = 9V$.\n    - $\\mu_- = \\min(3V+3V, 6V) = 6V$.\n    - $\\Delta_c^{CO} = \\mu_+ - \\mu_- = 9V - 6V = 3V$.\n\n**Step 3: Final Answer**\n\nThe problem asks for the charge gap at the transition point, where $V = U/3$.\nUsing the result from the MI phase calculation, we have $\\Delta_c = U$. This expression is independent of $V$.\nUsing the result from the CO phase calculation, we have $\\Delta_c = 3V$. Substituting the transition condition $V=U/3$, we get:\n$$ \\Delta_c = 3 \\left(\\frac{U}{3}\\right) = U $$\nBoth calculations agree, as expected. The charge gap at the phase transition is equal to $U$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{U} $$", "id": "1108377"}]}
