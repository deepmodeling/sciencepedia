Here, $d$ is the spatial dimension of the system. The characteristic temperature $T_0$ encapsulates the key microscopic properties of the material: the density of localized states at the Fermi level, $N(E_F)$, and the localization length of the electronic wavefunctions, $\\xi$.\n\nThe physical basis for this law is that at low temperatures, an electron will hop to a site that is not necessarily its nearest neighbor, but one that represents an optimal compromise between spatial distance $R$ (affecting wavefunction overlap, $\\propto e^{-2R/\\xi}$) and energy difference $\\Delta E$ (affecting thermal activation, $\\propto e^{-\\Delta E/k_B T}$). The typical energy separation $\\Delta E$ for a hop of distance $R$ can be estimated by requiring that there be, on average, one state available within a $d$-dimensional volume of radius $R$ and within an energy shell of width $\\Delta E$ around the Fermi level.
