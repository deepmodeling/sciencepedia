This exercise provides a direct way to probe the quantum nature of these edge states by examining how they transform under the protecting spin-rotation symmetry [@problem_id:1202706].", "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional chain of spin-1 particles located at sites $i=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$. The spin-1 Hilbert space at each site $i$ is described as the symmetric subspace of a system of two constituent spin-1/2 particles. The spin-1 operator at site $i$ is given by the sum of the operators of its constituent spin-1/2s, $\\vec{S}_i = \\vec{s}_{i,a} + \\vec{s}_{i,b}$. The spin operators for both spin-1 and spin-1/2 particles are defined in units of $\\hbar=1$ and obey the standard $su(2)$ Lie algebra.\n\nA specific quantum state, known as a valence-bond solid (VBS) state, is constructed for this semi-infinite chain. The construction is as follows: for each site $i \\ge 1$, the constituent spin-1/2 particle 'b' from site $i$ (with operator $\\vec{s}_{i,b}$) forms a spin-singlet state with the constituent spin-1/2 particle 'a' from the next site $i+1$ (with operator $\\vec{s}_{i+1,a}$). This bonding pattern extends over the entire semi-infinite chain. This construction leaves the constituent spin-1/2 particle 'a' at site $i=1$ (with operator $\\vec{s}_{1,a}$) unpaired.\n\nThis unpaired spin-1/2 at the edge gives rise to a two-fold degeneracy in the ground state of the system. Let $|\\Psi_{\\text{VBS}}\\rangle$ denote any state within this degenerate ground state manifold. These states are distinguished by the quantum state of the unpaired edge spin.\n\nThe system possesses a global spin-rotation symmetry, described by the unitary operator $U(\\hat{n}, \\phi) = \\exp(-i \\phi \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{S}_{\\text{tot}})$, where $\\vec{S}_{\\text{tot}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\vec{S}_i$ is the total spin operator and $\\hat{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector specifying the axis of rotation. The action of this operator on the many-body Hilbert space is given by $\\bigotimes_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\exp(-i\\phi \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{S}_i)$.\n\nYour task is to find the eigenvalue of the global rotation operator for a full $2\\pi$ rotation, $U(\\hat{n}, 2\\pi)$, when it acts on any of the degenerate VBS ground states $|\\Psi_{\\text{VBS}}\\rangle$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the eigenvalue of the $2\\pi$ rotation operator $U(\\hat{n}, 2\\pi)$ acting on a VBS ground state $|\\Psi_{\\text{VBS}}\\rangle$ of a semi-infinite spin-1 chain.\n\nFirst, let's express the rotation operator in terms of the constituent spin-1/2 operators. The spin-1 operator at site $i$ is $\\vec{S}_i = \\vec{s}_{i,a} + \\vec{s}_{i,b}$. The global rotation operator is a tensor product of single-site rotation operators:\n$$\nU(\\hat{n}, \\phi) = \\bigotimes_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\exp(-i\\phi \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{S}_i)\n$$\nSince the constituent spin operators $\\vec{s}_{i,a}$ and $\\vec{s}_{i,b}$ act on different Hilbert spaces (they belong to the same site $i$, but are distinct degrees of freedom), they commute: $[\\vec{s}_{i,a}, \\vec{s}_{i,b}] = 0$. This allows us to separate the exponential for each site:\n$$\n\\exp(-i\\phi \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{S}_i) = \\exp(-i\\phi \\hat{n} \\cdot (\\vec{s}_{i,a} + \\vec{s}_{i,b})) = \\exp(-i\\phi \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{s}_{i,a}) \\otimes \\exp(-i\\phi \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{s}_{i,b})\n$$\nThe full rotation operator can then be written as a product of rotations on all constituent spin-1/2s:\n$$\nU(\\hat{n}, \\phi) = \\bigotimes_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\exp(-i\\phi \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{s}_{i,a}) \\otimes \\exp(-i\\phi \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{s}_{i,b}) \\right)\n$$\n\nNext, let's analyze the structure of the VBS ground state $|\\Psi_{\\text{VBS}}\\rangle$. The state is formed by creating singlet pairs between spin $\\vec{s}_{i,b}$ and spin $\\vec{s}_{i+1,a}$ for all $i \\ge 1$. The spin $\\vec{s}_{1,a}$ is left unpaired. Let the state of this unpaired edge spin be $|\\alpha\\rangle_{1,a}$. The singlet state for two spin-1/2s, say $j$ and $k$, is given by $|\\psi_{\\text{singlet}}\\rangle_{j,k} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\uparrow\\rangle_j |\\downarrow\\rangle_k - |\\downarrow\\rangle_j |\\uparrow\\rangle_k)$.\nThe VBS ground state can be written as:\n$$\n|\\Psi_{\\text{VBS}}\\rangle = |\\alpha\\rangle_{1,a} \\otimes \\left( \\bigotimes_{i=1}^{\\infty} |\\psi_{\\text{singlet}}\\rangle_{i,b; i+1,a} \\right)\n$$\nThe two-fold degeneracy corresponds to the two possible orthogonal states for $|\\alpha\\rangle_{1,a}$, for example, spin-up $|\\uparrow\\rangle_{1,a}$ and spin-down $|\\downarrow\\rangle_{1,a}$.\n\nNow, we apply the rotation operator $U(\\hat{n}, \\phi)$ to this state. It is convenient to re-group the terms in the operator product to match the structure of the state:\n$$\nU(\\hat{n}, \\phi) = \\exp(-i\\phi \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{s}_{1,a}) \\otimes \\left( \\bigotimes_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\exp(-i\\phi \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{s}_{i,b}) \\otimes \\exp(-i\\phi \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{s}_{i+1,a}) \\right) \\right)\n$$\nLet's consider the action of the rotation on a single singlet pair. The singlet state is rotationally invariant. This means that for any rotation $R = \\exp(-i\\phi \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{s})$, the operator $R \\otimes R$ acting on the singlet state leaves it unchanged:\n$$\n(R \\otimes R) |\\psi_{\\text{singlet}}\\rangle = |\\psi_{\\text{singlet}}\\rangle\n$$\nThis is a fundamental property of the singlet state, as it is the unique state with total spin $S=0$. Therefore, for each bond $(i,b; i+1,a)$:\n$$\n\\left( \\exp(-i\\phi \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{s}_{i,b}) \\otimes \\exp(-i\\phi \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{s}_{i+1,a}) \\right) |\\psi_{\\text{singlet}}\\rangle_{i,b; i+1,a} = |\\psi_{\\text{singlet}}\\rangle_{i,b; i+1,a}\n$$\nThe entire \"bulk\" of the VBS state, which consists of an infinite product of singlets, is invariant under the global rotation.\n\nThe action of the full rotation operator $U(\\hat{n}, \\phi)$ on $|\\Psi_{\\text{VBS}}\\rangle$ thus simplifies to its action on the unpaired edge spin $\\vec{s}_{1,a}$:\n$$\nU(\\hat{n}, \\phi) |\\Psi_{\\text{VBS}}\\rangle = \\left( \\exp(-i\\phi \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{s}_{1,a}) |\\alpha\\rangle_{1,a} \\right) \\otimes \\left( \\bigotimes_{i=1}^{\\infty} |\\psi_{\\text{singlet}}\\rangle_{i,b; i+1,a} \\right)\n$$\n\nWe are interested in a rotation by $\\phi = 2\\pi$. The rotation operator for a single spin-1/2 particle for an angle of $2\\pi$ is:\n$$\nR^{(1/2)}(\\hat{n}, 2\\pi) = \\exp(-i 2\\pi \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{s})\n$$\nUsing the relation $\\vec{s} = \\frac{1}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$, where $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices, we get:\n$$\nR^{(1/2)}(\\hat{n}, 2\\pi) = \\exp\\left(-i 2\\pi \\hat{n} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{\\sigma}}{2}\\right) = \\exp(-i \\pi \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})\n$$\nUsing Euler's formula for matrix exponentials, $\\exp(i\\theta \\mathbf{M}) = \\cos(\\theta)I + i\\sin(\\theta)\\mathbf{M}$ for any matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ such that $\\mathbf{M}^2=I$, and noting that $(\\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})^2 = I$:\n$$\nR^{(1/2)}(\\hat{n}, 2\\pi) = \\cos(\\pi) I - i \\sin(\\pi) (\\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}) = (-1) I - i(0)(\\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}) = -I\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix. Thus, a $2\\pi$ rotation on a spin-1/2 state results in a multiplication by $-1$.\n\nApplying this to the edge spin:\n$$\n\\exp(-i 2\\pi \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{s}_{1,a}) |\\alpha\\rangle_{1,a} = -I |\\alpha\\rangle_{1,a} = -|\\alpha\\rangle_{1,a}\n$$\nThis result is independent of the state $|\\alpha\\rangle_{1,a}$ of the edge spin. Therefore, for any of the degenerate ground states:\n$$\nU(\\hat{n}, 2\\pi) |\\Psi_{\\text{VBS}}\\rangle = - |\\Psi_{\\text{VBS}}\\rangle\n$$\nThe eigenvalue of the $2\\pi$ rotation operator is $-1$. This result is independent of the rotation axis $\\hat{n}$ and the specific state chosen from the degenerate ground state manifold.
