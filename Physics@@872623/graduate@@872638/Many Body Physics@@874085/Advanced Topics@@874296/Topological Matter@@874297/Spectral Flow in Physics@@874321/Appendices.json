By adiabatically increasing the monopole's magnetic flux, we can directly count the number of quantum states that migrate into the ground state manifold, known as the Lowest Landau Level [@problem_id:1198446]. This exercise beautifully illustrates spectral flow as a change in the degeneracy of an energy level in response to a changing external parameter.", "problem": "A non-relativistic particle of mass $m$ and electric charge $q$ is constrained to move on the surface of a sphere of radius $R$. At the center of the sphere is a static magnetic monopole. The interaction of the particle with the monopole's magnetic field is characterized by a dimensionless strength parameter $s$. According to Dirac's quantization condition, this parameter must be a half-integer, i.e., $s = n/2$ for some integer $n$, which is called the monopole number.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues of the particle are given by the formula:\n$$E_j(s) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2mR^2} \\left[ j(j+1) - s^2 \\right]$$\nwhere $j$ is the total angular momentum quantum number. For a given monopole strength $s$, the allowed values of $j$ are $j = |s|, |s|+1, |s|+2, \\dots$. Each energy level corresponding to a specific $j$ has a degeneracy of $g_j = 2j+1$.\n\nThe set of quantum states corresponding to the lowest possible energy for a fixed $s$ is known as the Lowest Landau Level (LLL).\n\nSuppose the system is initially prepared with a non-negative monopole number, i.e., the initial strength is $s_i = n/2$ where $n$ is a non-negative integer ($n \\ge 0$).

This problem investigates a 2+1 dimensional system of Dirac fermions where a spatially-varying mass term forms a domain wall [@problem_id:1198464]. This setup is a quintessential example of the Jackiw-Rebbi mechanism, demonstrating that a change in the topological properties of the Hamiltonian in space necessitates the existence of zero-energy modes bound to the interface. Calculating the number of these protected chiral modes provides a hands-on application of index theory and spectral flow in a field-theoretic context.", "problem": "Consider a 2+1 dimensional system of Dirac fermions described by the Hamiltonian:\n$$H = v_F (\\sigma_x p_x + \\sigma_z p_y) + m(x) \\sigma_y$$\nwhere $p_x = -i\\hbar\\partial_x$ and $p_y = -i\\hbar\\partial_y$ are momentum operators, $\\sigma_i$ are the Pauli matrices, and $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity. For simplicity, we set $\\hbar=v_F=1$.\n\nThe mass term $m(x)$ is not constant but forms a domain wall profile along the $x$-direction, given by:\n$$m(x) = m_0 \\tanh(x/L)$$\nwhere $m_0  0$ is the bulk mass magnitude and $L  0$ is the characteristic width of the wall. This mass profile creates a topological defect, as the mass changes sign from $-m_0$ at $x \\to -\\infty$ to $+m_0$ at $x \\to +\\infty$.\n\nSuch a domain wall can trap chiral fermion modes, which are localized at the wall (in the $x$-direction) and propagate freely along it (in the $y$-direction). The number of these modes is a topological invariant.\n\nThe problem can be reduced to an effective 1D problem by considering states with a definite momentum $k_y$ along the wall. The number of bound chiral modes is equal to the absolute value of the spectral flow of the resulting 1D Hamiltonian family $H_{1D}(k_y)$ as $k_y$ is swept from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$.

The system is translationally invariant along the $y$-direction, so we can Fourier transform with respect to $y$. We replace the operator $-i\\partial_y$ with its eigenvalue $k_y$, the momentum along the domain wall. This yields a family of 1D Hamiltonians parameterized by $k_y$:\n$$H_{1D}(k_y) = -i\\sigma_x\\partial_x + k_y\\sigma_z + m(x)\\sigma_y$$\nThis operator acts on two-component spinor wavefunctions $\\psi(x)$. In the standard basis where $\\sigma_z$ is diagonal, the Hamiltonian is:\n$$H_{1D}(k_y) = \\begin{pmatrix} k_y  -i\\partial_x - im(x) \\\\ -i\\partial_x + im(x)  -k_y \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe number of chiral modes is given by the absolute value of the spectral flow of $H_{1D}(k_y)$ as $k_y$ varies from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$. The spectral flow counts the net number of eigenvalues crossing $E=0$ from below.\n\nA powerful method to compute the spectral flow for this type of Hamiltonian family, $H(k_y) = D + k_y \\Gamma$, is via an index theorem, provided that the operator $D=H_{1D}(0)$ anti-commutes with the grading operator $\\Gamma=\\sigma_z$.

A zero-energy eigenstate (a zero mode) of $H_{1D}(k_y)$ corresponds to an eigenvalue crossing $E=0$ at that specific value of $k_y$. Let's find the values of $k_y$ for which zero modes exist. The condition is $H_{1D}(k_y)\\psi = 0$.\n$$k_y u -i(\\partial_x+m)v = 0$$\n$$-i(\\partial_x-m)u - k_y v = 0$$\nIf $k_y \\neq 0$, we can solve for $v$ from the second equation: $v = -\\frac{i}{k_y}(\\partial_x-m)u$. Substituting into the first gives:\n$$k_y u - \\frac{1}{k_y}(\\partial_x+m)(\\partial_x-m)u = 0$$\n$$k_y^2 u = (\\partial_x+m)(\\partial_x-m)u = (\\partial_x^2 - m(x)^2 - m'(x))u$$\nThis is an effective Schrödinger equation $(-\\partial_x^2 + m(x)^2 + m'(x))u = -k_y^2 u$. A zero mode of $H_{1D}(k_y)$ for $k_y \\neq 0$ requires a solution $u(x)$ to this equation that is also part of a valid spinor solution which satisfies the original first-order equations. If we substitute $u$ back, we also need $(\\partial_x - m)u \\neq 0$ (since $v$ must be non-zero for a non-trivial solution if $u$ is non-zero). However, if we have a solution to the second-order equation, it must also satisfy the original coupled first-order equations. It turns out that any normalizable solution to the squared problem does not satisfy the original first order problem unless $k_y=0$.\n\nLet's focus on the case $k_y=0$, which corresponds to finding the kernel of $D=H_{1D}(0)$. The equations become:\n$$(\\partial_x+m(x))v = 0$$\n$$(\\partial_x-m(x))u = 0$$\nThe solutions are $v(x) = C_1 \\exp(-\\int_0^x m(x')dx')$ and $u(x) = C_2 \\exp(\\int_0^x m(x')dx')$.\nThe mass profile is $m(x) = m_0 \\tanh(x/L)$. The integral is:\n$$\\int_0^x m(x')dx' = m_0 \\int_0^x \\tanh(x'/L)dx' = m_0 L \\ln(\\cosh(x/L))$$\nSo the solutions are:\n$$u(x) = C_2 [\\cosh(x/L)]^{m_0 L}$$\n$$v(x) = C_1 [\\cosh(x/L)]^{-m_0 L}$$\nFor a state to be physically acceptable (bound to the domain wall), its wavefunction must be normalizable, i.e., $\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty |\\psi(x)|^2 dx  \\infty$.\nAs $|x| \\to \\infty$, $\\cosh(x/L) \\sim e^{|x|/L}$.\nThe solution $u(x)$ behaves as $e^{m_0|x|}$, which diverges. Thus, we must have $C_2=0$.\nThe solution $v(x)$ behaves as $e^{-m_0|x|}$, which decays exponentially and is normalizable. Thus, we can have $C_1 \\neq 0$.\n\nThis means that for $k_y=0$, there is exactly one zero mode, given by:\n$$\\psi_0(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ v(x) \\end{pmatrix} = C_1 \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ (\\cosh(x/L))^{-m_0 L} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis single zero mode at $k_y=0$ implies there is exactly one energy level that crosses $E=0$. To find the spectral flow, we need to determine the direction of this crossing. The slope of the energy band at the crossing point is given by first-order perturbation theory:\n$$E(k_y) \\approx k_y \\frac{\\langle \\psi_0 | \\sigma_z | \\psi_0 \\rangle}{\\langle \\psi_0 | \\psi_0 \\rangle}$$\nLet's compute the numerator:\n$$\\langle \\psi_0 | \\sigma_z | \\psi_0 \\rangle = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\psi_0^\\dagger(x) \\sigma_z \\psi_0(x) dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty |C_1|^2 (0, [\\cosh(x/L)]^{-m_0 L}) \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ [\\cosh(x/L)]^{-m_0 L} \\end{pmatrix} dx$$\n$$\\langle \\psi_0 | \\sigma_z | \\psi_0 \\rangle = -|C_1|^2 \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty [\\cosh(x/L)]^{-2m_0 L} dx$$\nSince $m_00$ and $L0$, the integrand is positive, so the integral is positive. Therefore, $\\langle \\psi_0 | \\sigma_z | \\psi_0 \\rangle  0$. This means the slope $dE/dk_y$ at $k_y=0$ is negative. The energy level crosses $E=0$ from positive to negative values as $k_y$ increases.\n\nThe spectral flow is the net number of upward crossings. Since there is only one crossing and it is downward, the spectral flow is -1.\n$$\\text{Spectral Flow} = -1$$\nThe problem asks for the number of chiral fermion modes, which corresponds to the number of energy bands crossing the Fermi level ($E=0$). This is given by the absolute value of the spectral flow.\n$$\\text{Number of modes} = |\\text{Spectral Flow}| = |-1| = 1$$\nThere is exactly one chiral fermion mode bound to the domain wall. The sign of the flow indicates the chirality of the mode (i.e., its direction of propagation).
