Condition for van Hove Singularities**\n\nVan Hove singularities occur at energies $E(\\mathbf{k}^*)$ corresponding to critical points $\\mathbf{k}^*$ in the Brillouin zone, where the gradient of the energy dispersion is zero:\n$$ \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} E(\\mathbf{k}) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial k_x}, \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial k_y}\\right) = (0, 0) $$\n\n**2. Calculating the Gradient**\n\nFirst, we compute the partial derivatives of the given dispersion relation $E(\\mathbf{k}) = -2t(\\cos k_x + \\cos k_y) - 4t' \\cos k_x \\cos k_y$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial k_x} = 2t \\sin k_x + 4t' \\sin k_x \\cos k_y = \\sin k_x (2t + 4t' \\cos k_y) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial k_y} = 2t \\sin k_y + 4t' \\cos k_x \\sin k_y = \\sin k_y (2t + 4t' \\cos k_x) $$\n\n**3. Solving for Critical Points**\n\nWe need to solve the system of equations:\n(1) $\\sin k_x (2t + 4t' \\cos k_y) = 0$\n(2) $\\sin k_y (2t + 4t' \\cos k_x) = 0$\n\nThis system leads to four possible cases for solutions $(k_x, k_y)$:\n- **Case A:** $\\sin k_x = 0$ and $\\sin k_y = 0$. This implies $k_x, k_y \\in \\{0, \\pi\\}$. The critical points are $(0,0)$, $(\\pi,0)$, $(0,\\pi)$, and $(\\pi,\\pi)$.\n- **Case B:** $\\sin k_x = 0$ and $2t + 4t' \\cos k_x = 0$. From $\\sin k_x = 0$, we have $\\cos k_x = \\pm 1$. The second equation becomes $2t \\pm 4t' = 0$, or $t = \\mp 2t'$. Since the problem states $0 < t < 2t'$, this case is not possible.\n- **Case C:** $2t + 4t' \\cos k_y = 0$ and $\\sin k_y = 0$. This is analogous to Case B and is not possible under the given conditions.\n- **Case D:** $2t + 4t' \\cos k_y = 0$ and $2t + 4t' \\cos k_x = 0$. This yields:\n$$ \\cos k_x = \\cos k_y = -\\frac{2t}{4t'} = -\\frac{t}{2t'} $$\nThe problem specifies that $0 < t < 2t'$, which implies $0 < \\frac{t}{2t'} < 1$. Therefore, $-1 < -\\frac{t}{2t'} < 0$, and real solutions for $k_x$ and $k_y$ exist. These are a new set of critical points, distinct from those in Case A.\n\n**4. Classifying the Critical Points**\n\nTo distinguish between minima, maxima, and saddle points, we analyze the Hessian matrix $H_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial k_i \\partial k_j}$. Its determinant, $\\det(H)$, determines the nature of the critical point.\nThe second derivatives are:\n$$ H_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial k_x^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_x} (\\sin k_x (2t + 4t' \\cos k_y)) = \\cos k_x(2t + 4t' \\cos k_y) $$\n$$ H_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial k_y^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_y} (\\sin k_y (2t + 4t' \\cos k_x)) = \\cos k_y(2t + 4t' \\cos k_x) $$\n$$ H_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial k_x \\partial k_y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_x} (\\sin k_y (2t + 4t' \\cos k_x)) = -4t' \\sin k_y \\sin k_x $$\n\nNow, we evaluate the Hessian at the critical points of Case D, where $2t + 4t' \\cos k_x = 0$ and $2t + 4t' \\cos k_y = 0$.\nAt these points:\n$$ H_{xx} = \\cos k_x (2t + 4t' \\cos k_y) = \\cos k_x (0) = 0 $$\n$$ H_{yy} = \\cos k_y (2t + 4t' \\cos k_x) = \\cos k_y (0) = 0 $$\n$$ H_{xy} = -4t' \\sin k_x \\sin k_y $$\nThe determinant of the Hessian is:\n$$ \\det(H) = H_{xx}H_{yy} - (H_{xy})^2 = 0 - (-4t' \\sin k_x \\sin k_y)^2 = -16(t')^2 \\sin^2 k_x \\sin^2 k_y $$\nSince $\\cos k_x = \\cos k_y = -t/(2t')$ is not $\\pm 1$, we know that $k_x, k_y \\notin \\{0, \\pi\\}$, so $\\sin k_x \\neq 0$ and $\\sin k_y \\neq 0$. As $t' \\neq 0$, we have $\\det(H) < 0$. A point with a negative Hessian determinant is a saddle point. Therefore, the critical points from Case D correspond to the saddle-point singularities.\n\n(For completeness, analysis of Case A points under the condition $0 < t < 2t'$ shows that $(0,0)$ and $(\\pi,\\pi)$ are local minima, while $(\\pi,0)$ and $(0,\\pi)$ are local maxima.)\n\n**5.
