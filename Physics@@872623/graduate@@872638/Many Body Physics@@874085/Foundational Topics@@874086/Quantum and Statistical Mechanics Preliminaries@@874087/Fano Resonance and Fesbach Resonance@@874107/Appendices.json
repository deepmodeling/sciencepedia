A Fano resonance is a prime example of this phenomenon, appearing in systems where a discrete quantum state is coupled to a continuum of states. Such resonances are characterized by their distinctively asymmetric lineshapes and are observed in a vast range of physical systems, from atomic photoionization to electron transport in nanostructures.\n\nConsider a one-dimensional quantum system where an incident particle with energy $E$ can transmit through two channels: a direct, non-resonant background channel and a resonant channel involving a quasi-bound state. The total transmission amplitude $t(E)$ is the coherent sum of the amplitudes for these two pathways. The background path is described by a complex transmission amplitude $t_{bg}$. The resonant path involves a quasi-bound state with energy $E_R$. This state is coupled to the input (source) and output (drain) channels, which are modeled as continua.
