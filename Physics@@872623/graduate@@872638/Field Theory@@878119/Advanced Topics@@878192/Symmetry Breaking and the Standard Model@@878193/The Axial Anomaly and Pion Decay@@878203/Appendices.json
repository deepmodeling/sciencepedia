This symmetry is spontaneously broken down to the vector subgroup $SU(2)_V$ (isospin), giving rise to three massless Goldstone bosons, the pions ($\\pi^+, \\pi^0, \\pi^-$). The small, non-zero quark masses give the pions a small mass and lead to the Partially Conserved Axial Current (PCAC) hypothesis.\n\nThe PCAC relation connects the divergence of the isovector axial current, $J^{\\mu,a}_5(x) = \\bar{q}(x) \\gamma^\\mu \\gamma_5 \\frac{\\tau^a}{2} q(x)$ (where $q=(u,d)^T$ and $\\tau^a$ are the Pauli matrices), to the pion field $\\pi^a(x)$.
