## Introduction
Conformal Field Theory (CFT) stands as a cornerstone of modern theoretical physics, providing a powerful non-perturbative framework for describing scale-invariant systems. Its applications span from the [critical points](@entry_id:144653) of statistical models to the holographic description of quantum gravity. The remarkable predictive power of CFT stems from its rigid algebraic structure, which organizes the theory's entire operator content into a systematic hierarchy. At the heart of this structure lie the **[primary fields](@entry_id:153633)**, the fundamental building blocks from which all other operators, known as **descendants**, are generated.

This article aims to demystify this foundational principle. We will explore how the infinite-dimensional symmetries of two-dimensional CFTs, embodied by the Virasoro algebra, govern the relationship between [primary fields](@entry_id:153633) and their descendants. Understanding this mechanism is key to unlocking the full computational power of CFT, from determining [correlation functions](@entry_id:146839) and [fusion rules](@entry_id:142240) to classifying entire theories.

The journey begins in the first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, where we will delve into the algebraic construction of conformal families, the role of inner products and [null vectors](@entry_id:155273), and the powerful constraints they impose. Next, in **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, we will see this abstract machinery in action, exploring how the primary/descendant formalism provides a unified language to describe phenomena in statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics, and high-energy theory. Finally, **Hands-On Practices** will offer a set of guided exercises to solidify your understanding and develop practical skills in applying these concepts.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The axiomatic structure of two-dimensional [conformal field theory](@entry_id:145449), built upon the foundation of local operator algebras and their associated state spaces, reveals a remarkable internal consistency and predictive power. As established in the introduction, the entire operator content of a CFT is organized into "conformal families," each headed by a **primary field**. This chapter delves into the principles and mechanisms governing the structure of these families. We will explore how the infinite-dimensional Virasoro symmetry algebra dictates the relationships between a primary field and its infinitely many **descendants**, how these relationships are quantified through algebraic structures like the Gram matrix, and how special circumstances, such as the appearance of **[null vectors](@entry_id:155273)**, impose powerful constraints on the theory's correlation functions and [operator algebra](@entry_id:146444).

### The Structure of Conformal Families

At the heart of every conformal family lies a **primary field**, $\phi(z, \bar{z})$, or its corresponding state $|h, \bar{h}\rangle = \phi(0,0)|0\rangle$. A primary field is defined by its simple transformation properties under [conformal mappings](@entry_id:165890), which, at the algebraic level, translate to the defining conditions for a **primary state**:
1.  It is an eigenstate of the dilatation operator $L_0$ (and its antiholomorphic counterpart $\bar{L}_0$): $L_0|h\rangle = h|h\rangle$. The eigenvalue $h$ is the **conformal dimension** or **weight**.
2.  It is annihilated by all Virasoro generators with positive mode numbers: $L_n|h\rangle = 0$ for all $n > 0$.

These two conditions signify that a primary state is a "ground state" with respect to the Virasoro algebra. The complete set of states associated with this primary is generated by acting on it with the "creation" operators of the algebra, the generators $L_{-n}$ with $n > 0$. Any state of the form $|\psi\rangle = L_{-n_k} \dots L_{-n_1}|h\rangle$, where all $n_i > 0$, is called a **descendant state**. The collection of the primary state and all its descendants constitutes a representation of the Virasoro algebra known as a **Verma module**, denoted $V(c,h)$. The **level** of a descendant state is defined as the integer $N = \sum_{i=1}^k n_i$. All states at a given level $N$ are eigenstates of $L_0$ with eigenvalue $h+N$.

The operator corresponding to the level-1 descendant state $L_{-1}|h\rangle$ has a particularly direct physical interpretation. The Ward identity for [conformal transformations](@entry_id:159863) implies a fundamental relation between the action of $L_{-1}$ and spatial differentiation: $(L_{-1}\phi)(z) = \partial_z \phi(z)$. This means the first descendant in any conformal family simply corresponds to the derivative of its primary field. This connection is not merely formal; it is a crucial constraint linking algebraic structure to the analytic properties of correlation functions, a point we will return to later [@problem_id:357354].

### Inner Products and the Gram Matrix

For a CFT to describe a physical system with a probabilistic interpretation (i.e., a unitary theory), its Hilbert space must be equipped with a positive-definite inner product. In the context of the Virasoro algebra, unitarity requires that the generators satisfy the [hermiticity](@entry_id:141899) condition $(L_n)^\dagger = L_{-n}$. This, combined with the normalization of the primary state, $\langle h|h \rangle = 1$, allows for the computation of the inner product between any two states in the Verma module.

The procedure relies on systematically using the Virasoro commutation relations,
$$[L_m, L_n] = (m-n)L_{m+n} + \frac{c}{12}m(m^2-1)\delta_{m+n, 0},$$
to move all [annihilation operators](@entry_id:180957) ($L_n, n > 0$) to the right, where they annihilate the primary state $|h\rangle$, and all [creation operators](@entry_id:191512) ($L_{-n}, n > 0$) to the left, where their adjoints annihilate the bra state $\langle h|$.

As a concrete illustration of this procedure, let us compute the norm of the level-3 descendant state $|\psi\rangle = L_{-2}L_{-1}|h\rangle$. Its squared norm is given by the Gram [matrix element](@entry_id:136260) $\langle \psi | \psi \rangle = \langle h | (L_{-2}L_{-1})^\dagger (L_{-2}L_{-1}) | h \rangle = \langle h | L_1 L_2 L_{-2} L_{-1} | h \rangle$. The calculation proceeds by commuting the positive-moded generators past the negative-moded ones [@problem_id:357236]:

$\langle h | L_1 L_2 L_{-2} L_{-1} | h \rangle = \langle h | L_1 ([L_2, L_{-2}] + L_{-2}L_2) L_{-1} | h \rangle$
Using $[L_2, L_{-2}] = 4L_0 + \frac{c}{2}$ and $L_2 L_{-1} |h\rangle = ([L_2,L_{-1}] + L_{-1}L_2)|h\rangle = 3L_1|h\rangle = 0$, the expression simplifies.
$\langle h | L_1 (4L_0 + \frac{c}{2}) L_{-1} | h \rangle = (4(h+1) + \frac{c}{2}) \langle h | L_1 L_{-1} | h \rangle$.
Finally, using $[L_1, L_{-1}] = 2L_0$, we have $\langle h | L_1 L_{-1} | h \rangle = \langle h | 2L_0 | h \rangle = 2h$.
Putting it all together, the squared norm is $(4h+4+c/2)(2h) = h(8h+8+c)$. This result demonstrates how the inner product depends explicitly on the central charge $c$ and the primary's conformal dimension $h$.

The matrix of inner products between all [basis states](@entry_id:152463) at a given level $N$ is known as the **Gram matrix**, $G_N(c,h)$. Its elements are polynomials in $c$ and $h$.

This entire framework generalizes seamlessly to theories with extended symmetries, such as **affine Kac-Moody algebras**, which are generated by the modes $J^a_n$ of conserved currents. For instance, in the $\text{SU}(2)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model, primary states are highest-weight states of the $\widehat{\mathfrak{su}}(2)_k$ algebra, characterized by an isospin $j$. To compute the norm of a descendant like $J^+_{-1}|\Phi_j\rangle$, one follows the same logic, using the Kac-Moody [commutation relations](@entry_id:136780) [@problem_id:357339]. The squared norm is $\langle \Phi_j | J^-_1 J^+_{-1} | \Phi_j \rangle = \langle \Phi_j | [J^-_1, J^+_{-1}] | \Phi_j \rangle = \langle \Phi_j | k - 2J^z_0 | \Phi_j \rangle = k - 2j$. This shows that for a unitary representation, we must have $k \ge 2j$.

When a theory possesses multiple commuting symmetry algebras, such as a Virasoro algebra and a U(1) Kac-Moody algebra, the state space is built on primaries $|h,q\rangle$ labeled by both conformal dimension and charge. The Gram matrix at any level will include mixed elements between descendants generated by both $L_{-n}$ and $J_{-n}$ operators. Their computation requires the use of the mixed [commutation relations](@entry_id:136780), $[L_m, J_n] = -n J_{m+n}$. For example, the mixed element $\langle h,q | L_2 J_{-1} L_{-1} | h,q \rangle$ can be computed by moving $L_2$ to the right. The key commutator is $[L_2, J_{-1}] = J_1$, leading to a term $\langle h,q | J_1 L_{-1} | h,q \rangle = \langle h,q | [J_1, L_{-1}] | h,q \rangle = \langle h,q | J_0 | h,q \rangle = q$. The remaining terms vanish, yielding the elegant result that this specific off-diagonal Gram [matrix element](@entry_id:136260) is simply the U(1) charge $q$ [@problem_id:357261].

### Reducibility, Null Vectors, and the Kac Determinant

A Verma module $V(c,h)$ is, in general, an irreducible representation of the Virasoro algebra. However, for specific values of $c$ and $h$, it can become **reducible**. This occurs when the module contains a non-zero descendant state $|\chi\rangle$ that is, itself, a primary state, meaning it is annihilated by all $L_n$ for $n>0$. Such a state is called a **[singular vector](@entry_id:180970)** or **null vector**. In a unitary theory, a null vector must have zero norm, $\langle \chi | \chi \rangle = 0$.

The existence of a state with zero norm implies that the Gram matrix at that level must be non-invertible; its determinant must vanish. The determinant of the Gram matrix at level $N$, $\det G_N(c,h)$, is a polynomial in $c$ and $h$ known as the **Kac determinant**. Its zeros precisely map out the values of $(c,h)$ for which the Verma module is reducible.

Let's make this concrete by constructing the Kac determinant at level $N=2$. The basis of states is $\{L_{-2}|h\rangle, L_{-1}^2|h\rangle\}$. Using the same techniques as before, we can compute the four elements of the $2 \times 2$ Gram matrix $G_2$:
$G_{11} = \langle h|L_2 L_{-2}|h\rangle = 4h + c/2$
$G_{12} = \langle h|L_2 L_{-1}^2|h\rangle = 6h$
$G_{21} = \langle h|L_1^2 L_{-2}|h\rangle = 6h$
$G_{22} = \langle h|L_1^2 L_{-1}^2|h\rangle = 4h(2h+1)$
The determinant is therefore [@problem_id:357207]:
$$ \det G_2(c,h) = (4h + c/2)(8h^2+4h) - (6h)^2 = 32h^3 + (16+4c-36)h^2 + 2ch = 2h(16h^2 + (2c-10)h + c) $$
A level-2 null vector exists if and only if this expression is zero.

Once we know a null vector exists, we can find its explicit form. For example, in the theory describing the critical point of the 2D Ising model, $c=1/2$, a primary field with $h=1/2$ (the spin field $\sigma$) exists. Plugging these values into $\det G_2(c,h)$ confirms that it vanishes. We can therefore write the null vector as a generic level-2 state $|\chi\rangle = (L_{-2} + \lambda L_{-1}^2)|h\rangle$ and solve for $\lambda$ by imposing the primary condition, $L_1|\chi\rangle=0$ and $L_2|\chi\rangle=0$. The condition $L_1|\chi\rangle=0$ gives the constraint $3 + \lambda(4h+2) = 0$. For $h=1/2$, this immediately yields $\lambda = -3/4$. One can verify this also satisfies the $L_2|\chi\rangle=0$ condition [@problem_id:357357]. Thus, the state $|\chi\rangle = (L_{-2} - \frac{3}{4}L_{-1}^2)|h=1/2\rangle$ is a null vector.

### The Constraining Power of Null Vectors

The existence of a null vector $|\chi\rangle = \mathcal{D}(L_{-n})|h\rangle$ in the Verma module for a primary field $\phi$ has profound consequences. Due to the [state-operator correspondence](@entry_id:156407), this implies that the descendant operator $\mathcal{D}(\partial)\phi(z)$ is itself a primary operator. However, since its [correlation function](@entry_id:137198) with any other set of operators must vanish (a consequence of it being a null state), we arrive at an operator equation that must hold inside any correlator:
$$ \langle \mathcal{D}(\partial)\phi(z) \mathcal{O}_1(z_1) \dots \mathcal{O}_n(z_n) \rangle = 0 $$
This provides a powerful, non-perturbative constraint on the theory.

These constraints manifest in several ways:

**1. OPE Coefficients of Descendants:** Conformal symmetry fixes the OPE coefficients of descendant fields in terms of the coefficients of their primaries. Consider the OPE $\phi_1(z_1)\phi_2(z_2)$, which contains the contribution from the conformal family of a primary $\phi_3$. The first few terms are:
$$ \phi_1(z_1) \phi_2(z_2) \sim C_{123} (z_1 - z_2)^{h_3 - h_1 - h_2} \left[ \phi_3(z_2) + \beta (z_1 - z_2) (L_{-1} \phi_3)(z_2) + \dots \right] $$
The coefficient $\beta$ is not a new free parameter. By inserting this OPE into a three-point function $\langle\phi_1(z_1)\phi_2(z_2)\phi_3(z_3)\rangle$ and comparing its first-order expansion in $(z_1-z_2)$ with the known [exact form](@entry_id:273346) of the primary three-point function, one can solve for $\beta$. The result of this consistency check is $\beta = (h_1 - h_2 + h_3)/(2h_3)$ [@problem_id:357354]. This demonstrates how the algebraic structure rigidly determines the short-distance [operator algebra](@entry_id:146444).

**2. Belavin-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov (BPZ) Equations:** The operator equation for a null vector translates into a linear partial differential equation for any correlation function involving the degenerate primary field. These are the celebrated **BPZ equations**. For a level-2 null vector, the BPZ equation is a second-order PDE. This radically constrains the analytic structure of correlators. For example, a four-point function involving a degenerate field can be shown to satisfy an [ordinary differential equation](@entry_id:168621) in the cross-ratio variable $z$. Often, this ODE is of the hypergeometric type, and its solutions are the **conformal blocks**. Solving this equation allows for the non-perturbative determination of the correlation function [@problem_id:357209].

**3. Fusion Rules:** The BPZ equations also determine the **[fusion rules](@entry_id:142240)** of the theory, which specify the operator content of an OPE. The OPE $\phi_i \times \phi_j$ is a sum over all [primary fields](@entry_id:153633) $\phi_k$ in the theory: $\phi_i \times \phi_j = \sum_k N_{ij}^k \phi_k$. The integer coefficients $N_{ij}^k$ form the fusion algebra. The allowed powers in the small-distance expansion of a four-point function correspond to the conformal dimensions of the fields appearing in the OPE channel. These powers are determined by the roots of the [indicial equation](@entry_id:165955) of the corresponding BPZ differential equation. For instance, in the Yang-Lee edge singularity model ($c=-22/5$), the non-trivial primary $\phi$ has dimension $\Delta_\phi = -1/5$ and a null vector at level 2. Analyzing the [indicial equation](@entry_id:165955) for the four-point function $\langle \phi \phi \phi \phi \rangle$ reveals that the only [primary fields](@entry_id:153633) that can appear in the $\phi \times \phi$ OPE are the [identity operator](@entry_id:204623) $I$ and the field $\phi$ itself [@problem_id:357230]. This leads to the fusion rule $\phi \times \phi = I + \phi$, demonstrating how the entire [operator algebra](@entry_id:146444) can be bootstrapped from the null vector structure.

### Beyond Unitarity: Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory

The appearance of a null vector signals a point of reducibility. In unitary theories, the null state and its descendants are simply removed from the Hilbert space. However, in non-unitary theories, a richer structure can emerge at these special $(c,h)$ values: a **Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory (LCFT)**.

In an LCFT, the dilatation operator $L_0$ may no longer be diagonalizable on the space of states at a given level. Instead, it can possess rank-2 Jordan cells. This means that for a primary field $\phi$ (with $L_0 \phi = h\phi$), there exists a **logarithmic partner** field $t$ such that:
$$ L_0 t = h t + \phi $$
This algebraic structure is reflected in the OPE of the [energy-momentum tensor](@entry_id:150076) $T(z)$ with these fields, and it fundamentally alters the form of [correlation functions](@entry_id:146839). The two-point functions in the $(\phi, t)$ sector become:
$$ \langle \phi(z) \phi(w) \rangle = 0 $$
$$ \langle \phi(z) t(w) \rangle = \frac{b}{(z-w)^{2h}} $$
$$ \langle t(z) t(w) \rangle = \frac{-2b \ln(z-w) + d}{(z-w)^{2h}} $$
The appearance of a logarithm in the correlator gives the theory its name. The constant $b$ is a crucial piece of dynamical data called the **logarithmic coupling**.

There is a deep connection between the null vector that would have existed at this $(c,h)$ point and the logarithmic structure that replaces it. The very coefficient in the null vector equation determines the value of the logarithmic coupling. For example, the LCFT with $c=-2$ features a primary with $h=-1/8$. This is a point where a level-2 null vector of the form $|\chi\rangle = (L_{-2} - \alpha L_{-1}^2)|h\rangle$ is expected. As we saw, the general condition for such a vector implies $\alpha = 3/(2(2h+1))$. For $h=-1/8$, this gives $\alpha=2$. In a conventionally normalized LCFT, the logarithmic coupling is given by $b = -1/(2\alpha)$. Therefore, for this theory, the logarithmic coupling is fixed to be $b = -1/(2 \cdot 2) = -1/4$ [@problem_id:357240]. This beautiful result shows that the same algebraic conditions that lead to simplification (decoupling of [null states](@entry_id:154996)) in unitary theories lead to complexity (logarithmic structures) in non-unitary ones, all governed by the same underlying principles of the Virasoro algebra.
