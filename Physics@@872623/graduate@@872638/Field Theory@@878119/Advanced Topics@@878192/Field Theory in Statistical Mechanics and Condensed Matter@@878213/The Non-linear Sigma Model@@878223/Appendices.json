A common example is the O(3) non-linear sigma model, where the target space is the 2-sphere, $S^2$. The symmetries of the target space metric lead to conserved quantities in the physical theory. These symmetries are generated by Killing vector fields.\n\nConsider a 2-sphere $S^2$ of radius $R$ with the standard round metric. In stereographic coordinates $(\\xi, \\eta)$, obtained by projection from the North Pole onto the equatorial plane, the metric tensor $g_{ij}$ is given by:\n$$\nds^2 = g_{\\xi\\xi} d\\xi^2 + g_{\\eta\\eta} d\\eta^2 = \\frac{4R^2}{(R^2+\\xi^2+\\eta^2)^2}(d\\xi^2 + d\\eta^2)\n$$\nThis means the metric tensor is diagonal, with $g_{\\xi\\xi} = g_{\\eta\\eta} = \\frac{4R^2}{(R^2+\\xi^2+\\eta^2)^2}$ and $g_{\\xi\\eta} = g_{\\eta\\xi} = 0$.\n\nA continuous symmetry of the sphere is the rotation about the axis passing through the North and South poles.
