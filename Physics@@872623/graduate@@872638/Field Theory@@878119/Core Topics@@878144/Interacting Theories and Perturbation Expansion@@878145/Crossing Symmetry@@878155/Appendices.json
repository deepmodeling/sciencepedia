To relate the amplitudes, we can formally move particles from the initial state to the final state (where they become antiparticles) and vice-versa.\n\nTo obtain Process 2 from Process 1, we need to perform the following crossings:\n1.  Move the initial-state particle $\\sigma(p_2)$ to the final state. Since $\\sigma$ is a real field, it is its own antiparticle. Its momentum in the final state is taken to be $-p_2$.\n2.  Move the final-state particle $\\phi^-(p_3)$ to the initial state. It becomes its antiparticle, $\\phi^+$.
