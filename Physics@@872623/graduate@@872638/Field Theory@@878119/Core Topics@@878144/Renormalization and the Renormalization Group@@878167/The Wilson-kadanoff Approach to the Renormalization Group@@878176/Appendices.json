This exercise provides a hands-on application of the Wilson-Kadanoff procedure to the problem of bond percolation on a triangular lattice. By explicitly constructing a coarse-graining rule that maps the original lattice to a rescaled one, you will calculate the renormalized bond probability and locate the critical fixed point that governs the percolation transition [@problem_id:443576]. This practice is fundamental for understanding how macroscopic critical behavior emerges from microscopic rules and for learning how to extract universal quantities like the correlation length exponent $\\nu$.", "problem": "This problem explores a real-space renormalization group (RSRG) transformation for bond percolation on a two-dimensional triangular lattice.\n\n**Background:**\nIn bond percolation, each bond (or edge) of a lattice is occupied with probability $p$, independently of all other bonds. We are interested in the properties of the clusters of connected sites that form. At a critical probability $p_c$, a cluster spanning the entire lattice appears for the first time. The correlation length $\\xi$, which measures the typical size of finite clusters, diverges as $\\xi \\propto |p - p_c|^{-\\nu}$, where $\\nu$ is the correlation length critical exponent.\n\nThe RSRG is a method to study critical phenomena by relating the properties of a system at one length scale to another. A transformation $p' = R(p)$ is constructed, which maps the original system with parameter $p$ to a new system on a rescaled lattice with parameter $p'$. The critical probability $p_c$ is given by an unstable fixed point of this map, i.e., $p_c = R(p_c)$ with $|dR/dp|_{p_c} > 1$. The critical exponent $\\nu$ is related to the derivative $\\lambda = dR/dp|_{p_c}$ and the length rescaling factor $b$ by the formula $\\nu = \\ln(b) / \\ln(\\lambda)$.\n\n**The RSRG Transformation:**\nConsider a triangular lattice $\\mathcal{L}$. The RSRG scheme is defined as follows:\n1.  The sites of the new, renormalized lattice $\\mathcal{L}'$ are placed at the geometric centers of the elementary triangles of $\\mathcal{L}$. The resulting lattice $\\mathcal{L}'$ is a honeycomb lattice.\n2.  The state of a bond in $\\mathcal{L}'$ between two adjacent new sites is determined by the configuration of bonds in the two original triangles corresponding to those sites. Let the two original triangles be $T_1$ and $T_2$, sharing a common edge. Let the vertices of $T_1$ be $\\{V_1, V_2, V_3\\}$ and those of $T_2$ be $\\{V_2, V_3, V_4\\}$, so the shared edge connects $V_2$ and $V_3$.\n3.  The new bond in $\\mathcal{L}'$ is declared occupied if there is at least one path of occupied bonds between vertex $V_1$ and vertex $V_4$, with all bonds in the path belonging to the set of five bonds that form the edges of $T_1$ and $T_2$.\n4.  This procedure defines the renormalized probability $p' = R(p)$ of a bond being occupied on the honeycomb lattice $\\mathcal{L}'$.
