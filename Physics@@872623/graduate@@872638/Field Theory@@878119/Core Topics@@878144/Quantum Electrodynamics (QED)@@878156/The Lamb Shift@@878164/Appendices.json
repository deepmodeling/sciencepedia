This implies that states with the same $n$ and $j$ but different orbital angular momentum quantum numbers $l$ should be degenerate. For instance, the $2S_{1/2}$ (where $n=2, l=0, j=1/2$) and $2P_{1/2}$ (where $n=2, l=1, j=1/2$) states are predicted to have the exact same energy. However, experiments conducted by Willis Lamb and Robert Retherford in 1947 revealed that this is not the case. The modern theory of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) explains this discrepancy by accounting for the interaction between the electron and the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. This interaction lifts the degeneracy, causing a small energy difference between the two levels, a phenomenon known as the Lamb shift. Spectroscopic measurements show that the frequency difference corresponding to the transition between the $2S_{1/2}$ and $2P_{1/2}$ states is approximately $f = 1057$ MHz.\n\nGiven the following physical constants:\n- Planck's constant, $h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s}$\n- The elementary charge, $e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ C}$\n\nCalculate the magnitude of this energy split, the Lamb shift, for the $n=2$ states of hydrogen.

Let the energy of the $2S_{1/2}$ state be higher than the $2P_{1/2}$ state by the Lamb shift energy $S$.
