Derivation Steps**\n\n#### **Step 1: Find the coordinate time of intersection**\nTo find when the particle's worldline intersects the future light cone of event $Y$, we substitute the particle's position coordinates into the light cone equation:\n$$\nt^2 - (L + v_x t)^2 - (v_y t)^2 = 0\n$$\nNow, we expand and rearrange the terms to solve for $t$:\n$$\nt^2 - (L^2 + 2L v_x t + v_x^2 t^2) - v_y^2 t^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\nt^2 - L^2 - 2L v_x t - v_x^2 t^2 - v_y^2 t^2 = 0\n$$\nGrouping the terms by powers of $t$:\n$$\n(1 - v_x^2 - v_y^2)t^2 - (2L v_x) t - L^2 = 0\n$$\nRecognizing that $v^2 = v_x^2 + v_y^2$, this is a quadratic equation for $t$ of the form $at^2 + bt + c = 0$, with coefficients $a = 1 - v^2$, $b = -2L v_x$, and $c = -L^2$. We solve for $t$ using the quadratic formula:\n$$\nt = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{2L v_x \\pm \\sqrt{(-2L v_x)^2 - 4(1 - v^2)(-L^2)}}{2(1 - v^2)}\n$$\n$$\nt = \\frac{2L v_x \\pm \\sqrt{4L^2 v_x^2 + 4L^2(1 - v^2)}}{2(1 - v^2)} = \\frac{2L v_x \\pm \\sqrt{4L^2 (v_x^2 + 1 - (v_x^2+v_y^2))}}{2(1 - v^2)}\n$$\n$$\nt = \\frac{2L v_x \\pm \\sqrt{4L^2(1 - v_y^2)}}{2(1 - v^2)} = \\frac{2L v_x \\pm 2L\\sqrt{1 - v_y^2}}{2(1 - v^2)}\n$$\n$$\nt = \\frac{L(v_x \\pm \\sqrt{1 - v_y^2})}{1 - v^2}\n$$\nSince the intersection must happen on the *future* light cone, we require $t > 0$. As $v  1$, the denominator $1-v^2$ is positive. In the numerator, $\\sqrt{1-v_y^2}$ is real and positive. Also, since $v^2 = v_x^2+v_y^2  1$, we know $v_x^2  1-v_y^2$, which implies $|v_x|  \\sqrt{1-v_y^2}$. Therefore, the term $v_x + \\sqrt{1 - v_y^2}$ is always positive, while $v_x - \\sqrt{1 - v_y^2}$ is always negative. We must choose the positive root:\n$$\nt = \\frac{L(v_x + \\sqrt{1 - v_y^2})}{1 - v^2}\n$$\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Compute the proper time $\\tau$**\nNow we convert the coordinate time $t$ to the proper time $\\tau$ experienced by the particle:\n$$\n\\tau = t \\sqrt{1 - v^2}\n$$\nSubstitute the expression for $t$ we just found:\n$$\n\\tau = \\left( \\frac{L(v_x + \\sqrt{1 - v_y^2})}{1 - v^2} \\right) \\sqrt{1 - v^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{L(v_x + \\sqrt{1 - v_y^2})}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2}}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **3. Final Expression**\nFinally, substituting $v^2 = v_x^2 + v_y^2$, we get the proper time in terms of the given parameters:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{L (v_x + \\sqrt{1 - v_y^2})}{\\sqrt{1 - v_x^2 - v_y^2}}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{L \\left(v_x + \\sqrt{1 - v_y^2}\\right)}{\\sqrt{1 - v_x^2 - v_y^2}}}$$", "id": "371513"}, {"introduction": "One of the most profound consequences of the Lorentz transformations is the relativity of simultaneity—events simultaneous in one inertial frame are not necessarily simultaneous in another.

The speed of light is $c$.\n\nThe \"center of energy\" of a system of particles in a given reference frame is defined as the energy-weighted average of their positions, evaluated at a single instant of time in that frame.

Find the energies $E'_1$ and $E'_2$ in frame $S'$**\n\nIn frame $S$, the particles are at rest. Their four-momenta are $p_1^\\mu = (m_1 c, 0, 0, 0)$ and $p_2^\\mu = (m_2 c, 0, 0, 0)$, where the first component is $p^0 = E/c$. The energy in frame $S$ is $E_i = m_i c^2$.\n\nWe transform the four-momenta to frame $S'$. The energy is the time component of the four-momentum, which transforms as $E' = \\gamma (E - v p_x)$. For our particles, $p_x = 0$ in frame $S$.\nTherefore, for particle 1, the energy in frame $S'$ is:\n$$\nE'_1 = \\gamma (E_1 - v \\cdot 0) = \\gamma E_1 = \\gamma m_1 c^2\n$$\nSimilarly, for particle 2, the energy in frame $S'$ is $E'_2 = \\gamma m_2 c^2$.\n\nThe total energy in frame $S'$ is $E'_{tot} = E'_1 + E'_2 = \\gamma(m_1 + m_2)c^2$.\n\n**2. Find the positions $x'_1(t'=0)$ and $x'_2(t'=0)$ in frame $S'$**\n\nWe need to find the spatial coordinate $x'_i$ for each particle at the time $t'=0$ in frame $S'$. This requires relating the coordinates in the two frames. This is the crucial step where the relativity of simultaneity comes into play. The world line of particle $i$ in frame $S$ is simple, as it is at rest: $x_i(t) = d_i$ for all $t$.\n\nFor particle 1, its position in $S$ is always $x_1 = d_1$. We find the time $t_1$ in frame $S$ that corresponds to the event of measuring particle 1 at $t'=0$ in frame $S'$. We use the time transformation equation:\n$$\nt' = 0 = \\gamma \\left(t_1 - \\frac{v}{c^2} d_1\\right) \\implies t_1 = \\frac{v d_1}{c^2}\n$$\nNow we find the position $x'_1$ by substituting $x=d_1$ and this specific time $t=t_1$ into the position transformation:\n$$\nx'_1(t'=0) = \\gamma(d_1 - v t_1) = \\gamma\\left(d_1 - v \\frac{v d_1}{c^2}\\right) = \\gamma d_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right) = \\gamma d_1 (1/\\gamma^2) = \\frac{d_1}{\\gamma}\n$$\nWe repeat the same logic for particle 2, whose position in $S$ is $x_2=d_2$. The measurement in $S'$ at $t'=0$ corresponds to a time $t_2$ in frame $S$:\n$$\nt'=0 = \\gamma \\left(t_2 - \\frac{v}{c^2} d_2\\right) \\implies t_2 = \\frac{v d_2}{c^2}\n$$\n$$\nx'_2(t'=0) = \\gamma(d_2 - v t_2) = \\gamma\\left(d_2 - v \\frac{v d_2}{c^2}\\right) = \\gamma d_2 \\left(1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right) = \\frac{d_2}{\\gamma}\n$$\nNote that because $d_1 \\neq d_2$, we have $t_1 \\neq t_2$. The \"simultaneous\" measurement at $t'=0$ in frame $S'$ corresponds to two different moments in time, $t_1$ and $t_2$, in frame $S$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Center of Energy $X'_{CoE}$**\n\nNow we have all the components to substitute into the definition of the center of energy in frame $S'$.\n$$\nX'_{CoE}(t'=0) = \\frac{E'_1 x'_1(t'=0) + E'_2 x'_2(t'=0)}{E'_1 + E'_2}\n$$\n$$\nX'_{CoE}(t'=0) = \\frac{(\\gamma m_1 c^2) \\left(\\frac{d_1}{\\gamma}\\right) + (\\gamma m_2 c^2) \\left(\\frac{d_2}{\\gamma}\\right)}{\\gamma m_1 c^2 + \\gamma m_2 c^2}\n$$\nThe $\\gamma$ factors in the numerator cancel out:\n$$\nX'_{CoE}(t'=0) = \\frac{m_1 c^2 d_1 + m_2 c^2 d_2}{\\gamma (m_1 c^2 + m_2 c^2)}\n$$\nWe can cancel the common factor of $c^2$:\n$$\nX'_{CoE}(t'=0) = \\frac{m_1 d_1 + m_2 d_2}{\\gamma(m_1 + m_2)}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the definition of $\\gamma = (1-v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$:\n$$\nX'_{CoE}(t'=0) = \\frac{m_1 d_1 + m_2 d_2}{m_1 + m_2} \\left(1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right)^{1/2} = \\frac{(m_1 d_1 + m_2 d_2)\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}{m_1+m_2}\n$$\nThis is the final expression.
