The presence of physical boundaries can alter the spectrum of these vacuum fluctuations, leading to a finite, observable change in the vacuum energy known as the Casimir energy. This energy, in turn, gives rise to a physical force between the boundaries.\n\nConsider a massless, real scalar field $\\phi(x,t)$ in 1+1 dimensional spacetime (one spatial dimension $x$ and one time dimension $t$). The dynamics of this field are governed by the Klein-Gordon equation. Two perfectly reflecting parallel mirrors are placed at positions $x=0$ and $x=L$. For a scalar field, these boundary conditions are mathematically expressed as Dirichlet boundary conditions: $\\phi(0,t) = \\phi(L,t) = 0$.\n\nThe total zero-point energy of the field is given by the sum over the energies of all allowed normal modes: $E_0 = \\sum_n \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega_n$, where $\\omega_n$ are the mode frequencies and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nThe Casimir energy, $E_C(L)$, is defined as the difference between the zero-point energy of the field with the mirrors present and the zero-point energy in the same spatial region of length $L$ if the mirrors were absent (i.e., free space). Both of these energies, when calculated naively via mode summation or integration, are divergent.\n\nTo obtain a finite physical result, one must use a regularization procedure. We will use an exponential cutoff. The regularized energy of a mode with frequency $\\omega$ is taken to be $\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega e^{-\\alpha\\omega}$, where $\\alpha$ is a small positive parameter with units of time. The total regularized energy is found by summing (or integrating) over all modes. The Casimir energy is then calculated by subtracting the regularized free-space energy from the regularized energy in the cavity, and finally taking the limit $\\alpha \\to 0$.\n\nYour task is to derive the expression for the Casimir force $F_C = - \\frac{dE_C}{dL}$ between the two mirrors.
