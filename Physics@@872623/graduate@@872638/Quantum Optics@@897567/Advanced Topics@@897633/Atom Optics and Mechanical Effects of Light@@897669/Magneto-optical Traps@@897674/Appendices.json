It relies on two main components: a set of counter-propagating laser beams and a spatially varying magnetic field. The lasers are tuned to a frequency $\\omega_L$ that is slightly lower than a specific atomic transition frequency $\\omega_0$. This condition, known as red-detuning ($\\omega_L \\lt \\omega_0$), in conjunction with the Zeeman effect from the magnetic field and the Doppler effect from atomic motion, produces both a velocity-dependent damping force (cooling) and a position-dependent restoring force (trapping).\n\nConsider a misconfigured one-dimensional MOT where all components are set up correctly for trapping Rubidium-87 atoms — including the magnetic field gradient and the laser beam polarizations — with one crucial exception: the laser frequency $\\omega_L$ is inadvertently set to be slightly *higher* than the atomic resonance frequency $\\omega_0$. This configuration is known as blue-detuning ($\\omega_L \\gt \\omega_0$).\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the net effect of the laser light and magnetic field on atoms that enter the central region of this blue-detuned apparatus?\n\nA.
