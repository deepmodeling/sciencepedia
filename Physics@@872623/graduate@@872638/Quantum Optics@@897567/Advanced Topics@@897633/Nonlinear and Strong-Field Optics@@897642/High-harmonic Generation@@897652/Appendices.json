The maximum photon energy emitted, known as the cutoff energy, is given by the formula:\n$$ \\hbar \\omega_{\\text{cutoff}} = I_p + C U_p $$\nHere, $I_p$ is the ionization potential of the atom, $C$ is a dimensionless constant of order unity derived from classical trajectory analysis (its precise value is not needed for this problem), and $U_p$ is the ponderomotive potential.

Let $m_e$ be the mass of the electron, which is equal to the mass of the positron. The proton's mass is much larger than the electron's, so the reduced mass of the hydrogen atom is approximately $m_e$. The reduced mass of positronium is $\\mu = m_e/2$. The ground state binding energy (and thus the ionization potential) of a hydrogen-like system is directly proportional to its reduced mass. Let $I_p^H$ be the ionization potential of hydrogen.\n\nIn the case of hydrogen, the HHG process involves the electron tunneling away from the nearly stationary proton and being accelerated by the field. The relevant mass for its ponderomotive energy is $m_e$.\n\nIn the case of positronium, the system is symmetric. When one particle (e.g., the electron) tunnels away, the other particle (the positron) also moves in the field. The subsequent acceleration and recombination process is governed by the *relative motion* of the electron-positron pair. The dynamics of this relative motion are described by an effective particle with the reduced mass $\\mu$.
