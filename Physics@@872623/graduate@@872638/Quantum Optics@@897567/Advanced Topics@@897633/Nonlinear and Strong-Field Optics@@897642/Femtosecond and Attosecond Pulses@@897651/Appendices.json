Simple intensity measurements are insufficient. This is where techniques like Spectral Phase Interferometry for Direct Electric-field Reconstruction (SPIDER) become indispensable.

Successfully completing this problem illuminates how abstract phase coefficients are translated into tangible experimental data.", "problem": "In the technique of Spectral Phase Interferometry for Direct Electric-field Reconstruction (SPIDER), two time-delayed replicas of an ultrashort laser pulse are made to interfere in a spectrometer. One of the pulses is also frequency-shifted with respect to the other.
