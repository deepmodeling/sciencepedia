This first exercise focuses on the qualitative dynamics of the system, asking you to visualize the population transfer from the ground state to the excited state as the laser frequency is swept across the resonance. Understanding this smooth and complete population transfer is the first step toward mastering the concept of adiabatic following [@problem_id:2016800].", "problem": "A two-level quantum system, consisting of a ground state $|g\\rangle$ and an excited state $|e\\rangle$, is initially prepared in the ground state. It is then subjected to a laser field of constant intensity. The frequency of the laser is linearly swept in time, starting from a value far below the atomic transition frequency and ending at a value far above it. This process, known as Rapid Adiabatic Passage (RAP), is performed under conditions that ensure a complete and successful population transfer from the initial state to the other state.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the time evolution of the population of the ground state, $P_g(t)$, during this process?\n\nA. The population $P_g(t)$ starts at 1, rapidly oscillates between 1 and 0 for the duration of the laser interaction, and ends at an intermediate value.\n\nB. The population $P_g(t)$ starts at 1, briefly dips towards 0.5 when the laser frequency is resonant with the atomic transition, and then returns to 1.\n\nC. The population $P_g(t)$ remains approximately constant at 1 throughout the entire process.\n\nD. The population $P_g(t)$ starts at 1, smoothly decreases to approximately 0.5 when the laser frequency is resonant with the atomic transition, and subsequently continues to decrease smoothly to 0.\n\nE. The population $P_g(t)$ starts at 1 and drops almost instantaneously to 0 at the exact moment the laser frequency becomes resonant with the atomic transition.", "solution": "We analyze the system using the adiabatic theorem and the concept of dressed states. In the rotating frame and with the standard conventions used in the main text (basis $\\{|e\\rangle, |g\\rangle\\}$, detuning $\\Delta(t) = \\omega_0 - \\omega_L(t)$), we have two energy eigenstates, the dressed states $|D_+(t)\\rangle$ and $|D_-(t)\\rangle$.\n\nThe problem states the laser frequency $\\omega_L$ is swept from \"far below\" to \"far above\" the atomic transition frequency $\\omega_0$. This means $\\omega_L$ increases, so the detuning $\\Delta(t)$ sweeps from a large positive value to a large negative value ($\\Delta: +\\infty \\to -\\infty$).\n\nLet's examine the nature of the dressed states at the start and end of the sweep:\n*   **Start ($\\Delta \\to +\\infty$):** The dressed states approximate the bare states as $|D_+(t)\\rangle \\to |g\\rangle$ and $|D_-(t)\\rangle \\to |e\\rangle$.\n*   **End ($\\Delta \\to -\\infty$):** The roles are reversed, so $|D_+(t)\\rangle \\to |e\\rangle$ and $|D_-(t)\\rangle \\to |g\\rangle$.\n\nThe system is initially in the ground state $|g\\rangle$. At the start of the sweep, this corresponds to the upper dressed state, $|D_+(t)\\rangle$. The adiabatic theorem states that for a slow sweep, the system will remain in the instantaneous eigenstate it started in. Thus, the system's state will follow the $|D_+(t)\\rangle$ trajectory.\n\nThe population of the ground state at any time is the probability of finding the system in $|g\\rangle$, which is given by $P_g(t) = |\\langle g|\\psi(t)\\rangle|^2$. Since the system follows $|D_+(t)\\rangle$, we have $P_g(t) \\approx |\\langle g|D_+(t)\\rangle|^2$.\n*   At the start, the state is $|g\\rangle$, so $P_g(t)$ is 1.\n*   At resonance ($\\Delta=0$), the dressed states are equal superpositions of $|g\\rangle$ and $|e\\rangle$, so the population in each bare state is 0.5. Thus, $P_g(t)$ smoothly decreases to 0.5.\n*   At the end, the system's state has evolved to $|e\\rangle$, so the population in the ground state $P_g(t)$ has smoothly decreased to 0.\n\nThis describes a smooth, monotonic decrease from 1 to 0, passing through 0.5 at resonance. This matches option D.

This exercise moves from a qualitative picture to a quantitative requirement, asking you to derive the minimum interaction strength (Rabi frequency) needed to maintain adiabaticity for a given frequency sweep rate.
