This first exercise is foundational, tasking you with analyzing the atomic heart of a Correlated Emission Laser. By solving the steady-state density matrix equations for a model $\\Lambda$-scheme system, you will determine how the interplay of pumping, decay, and coherent driving fields establishes the population inversion—the very source of optical gain [@problem_id:658683].", "problem": "An ensemble of atoms, used as the gain medium for a Correlated Emission Laser (CEL), is modeled as a collection of identical three-level systems in a $\\Lambda$-configuration. The energy levels are denoted $|a\\rangle$ (the upper level) and $|b\\rangle, |c\\rangle$ (the two lower levels). The system dynamics are described by the density matrix $\\rho$.\n\nThe atoms are subject to the following processes:\n1.  An incoherent pump excites atoms from an external reservoir into the upper state $|a\\rangle$ at a constant rate $R$.\n2.  The upper state $|a\\rangle$ decays via spontaneous emission to the lower state $|b\\rangle$ at a rate $\\gamma_b$ and to state $|c\\rangle$ at a rate $\\gamma_c$. The total spontaneous emission rate from $|a\\rangle$ is $\\Gamma = \\gamma_b + \\gamma_c$.\n3.  The populations in all three levels, $|a\\rangle, |b\\rangle, |c\\rangle$, relax back to the external reservoir at a common rate $\\gamma$. This could model, for instance, the transit time of atoms through the laser beam.\n4.  Two coherent laser fields interact with the atoms. The field driving the $|a\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |b\\rangle$ transition has Rabi frequency $\\Omega_1$ and detuning $\\Delta_1 = \\omega_{ab} - \\nu_1$, where $\\omega_{ab}$ is the atomic transition frequency and $\\nu_1$ is the field frequency. The field driving the $|a\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |c\\rangle$ transition has Rabi frequency $\\Omega_2$ and detuning $\\Delta_2 = \\omega_{ac} - \\nu_2$.\n5.  The optical coherences $\\rho_{ab}$ and $\\rho_{ac}$ dephase at a total rate that includes contributions from all population decay channels. The coherence $\\rho_{bc}$ between the two lower levels dephases at an intrinsic rate $\\gamma_{bc}^{int}$, plus the contribution from the relaxation rate $\\gamma$. So the total decay rate for this coherence is $\\gamma_{bc} = \\gamma_{bc}^{int} + \\gamma$.\n\nThe steady-state density matrix equations in the rotating wave approximation are given by:\n-   $\\dot{\\rho}_{aa} = R - (\\Gamma+\\gamma)\\rho_{aa} + \\Omega_1 \\text{Im}(\\rho_{ab}) + \\Omega_2 \\text{Im}(\\rho_{ac}) = 0$\n-   $\\dot{\\rho}_{bb} = \\gamma_b \\rho_{aa} - \\gamma\\rho_{bb} - \\Omega_1 \\text{Im}(\\rho_{ab}) = 0$\n-   $\\dot{\\rho}_{cc} = \\gamma_c \\rho_{aa} - \\gamma\\rho_{cc} - \\Omega_2 \\text{Im}(\\rho_{ac}) = 0$\n-   $\\dot{\\rho}_{ab} = -(\\frac{\\Gamma+\\gamma}{2} - i\\Delta_1)\\rho_{ab} + \\frac{i\\Omega_1}{2}(\\rho_{aa}-\\rho_{bb}) - \\frac{i\\Omega_2}{2}\\rho_{cb} = 0$\n-   $\\dot{\\rho}_{ac} = -(\\frac{\\Gamma+\\gamma}{2} - i\\Delta_2)\\rho_{ac} + \\frac{i\\Omega_2}{2}(\\rho_{aa}-\\rho_{cc}) - \\frac{i\\Omega_1}{2}\\rho_{bc} = 0$\n-   $\\dot{\\rho}_{bc} = -(\\gamma_{bc} - i(\\Delta_1 - \\Delta_2))\\rho_{bc} + \\frac{i\\Omega_2}{2}\\rho_{ba} - \\frac{i\\Omega_1}{2}\\rho_{ac} = 0$\n\nSumming the population equations shows that the total steady-state population is $\\rho_{aa}+\\rho_{bb}+\\rho_{cc} = R/\\gamma$.
