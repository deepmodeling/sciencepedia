They are distinguished by the logical $Z$ operator, $Z_L = Z \\otimes Z \\otimes Z \\otimes Z \\otimes Z$, such that $Z_L|0_L\\rangle = +|0_L\\rangle$ and $Z_L|1_L\\rangle = -|1_L\\rangle$.

Consider the stabilizer $g_4 = Z_1 X_2 I_3 X_4 Z_5$. Since $X_1$ anti-commutes with the $Z_1$ part and commutes with all other parts, it anti-commutes with the whole stabilizer: $X_1 g_4 = -g_4 X_1$. Therefore, $\\langle 0_L|X_1|0_L\\rangle = 0$ and $\\langle 1_L|X_1|1_L\\rangle = 0$. This implies $\\langle X_1 \\rangle = 0$.\n\n3.  **For $Y_1$**: The operator $Y_1 = iX_1Z_1$ anti-commutes with both $X_1$ and $Z_1$. Let's use $g_1 = X_1 Z_2 Z_3 X_4 I_5$ again. Since $Y_1$ anti-commutes with the $X_1$ part and commutes with the others, it anti-commutes with the whole stabilizer: $Y_1 g_1 = -g_1 Y_1$. Therefore, $\\langle 0_L|Y_1|0_L\\rangle = 0$ and $\\langle 1_L|Y_1|1_L\\rangle = 0$.
