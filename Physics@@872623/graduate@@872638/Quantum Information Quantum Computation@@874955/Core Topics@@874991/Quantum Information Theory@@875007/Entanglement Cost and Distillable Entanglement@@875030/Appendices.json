In its recurrence form, the protocol proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Preparation:** Two parties, Alice and Bob, share two identical pairs of qubits, both in the Werner state $\\rho_W(F)$. Let's denote Alice's qubits as $A_1, A_2$ and Bob's as $B_1, B_2$. The first pair is $(A_1, B_1)$ and the second is $(A_2, B_2)$. The total state is $\\rho_{in} = \\rho_W(F)_{A_1 B_1} \\otimes \\rho_W(F)_{A_2 B_2}$.\n2.  **Local Operations:** Alice applies a CNOT gate with her first qubit ($A_1$) as control and her second qubit ($A_2$) as target. Simultaneously, Bob applies a CNOT gate using his first qubit ($B_1$) as control and his second qubit ($B_2$) as target.\n3.  **Measurement:** Alice and Bob measure their second qubits, $A_2$ and $B_2$, respectively, in the computational basis $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$.\n4.  **Post-selection:** They communicate their measurement outcomes. If their outcomes are identical (both measure 0 or both measure 1), they keep the first qubit pair $(A_1, B_1)$. If the outcomes differ, they discard the pair.\n5.  **Correction:** If the measurement outcome was '11', one of the parties (say, Bob) applies a Pauli-Z gate ($\\sigma_z$) to their remaining qubit ($B_1$).\n\nAfter this procedure, the resulting state of the pair $(A_1, B_1)$, conditioned on success, is a new state $\\rho_{out}$ which is also a Werner state but with a new fidelity $F'$.
