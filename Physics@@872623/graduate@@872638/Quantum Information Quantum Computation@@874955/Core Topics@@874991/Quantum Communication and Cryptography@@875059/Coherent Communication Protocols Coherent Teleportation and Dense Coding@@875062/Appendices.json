By analyzing how classical bit errors translate into Pauli errors on the teleported qubit, you will learn to calculate the impact of classical noise on the overall average fidelity of the quantum protocol [@problem_id:58402].", "problem": "In the standard quantum teleportation protocol, Alice wishes to send an unknown qubit state $|\\psi\\rangle = \\alpha|0\\rangle + \\beta|1\\rangle$ to Bob. They share a maximally entangled Bell state, which we take to be $|\\Phi^+\\rangle_{A_2B} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle + |11\\rangle)$, where qubit $A_2$ belongs to Alice and qubit $B$ belongs to Bob. Alice's qubit to be teleported is labeled $A_1$.\n\nThe total initial state is $|\\psi\\rangle_{A_1} |\\Phi^+\\rangle_{A_2B}$. Alice performs a measurement on her two qubits ($A_1, A_2$) in the Bell basis. The teleportation identity can be written as:\n$$\n|\\psi\\rangle_{A_1} |\\Phi^+\\rangle_{A_2B} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{a,b \\in \\{0,1\\}} |\\Psi_{ab}\\rangle_{A_1A_2} \\otimes (X^b Z^a |\\psi\\rangle_B)\n$$\nwhere $\\{|\\Psi_{ab}\\rangle_{A_1A_2}\\}$ is the Bell basis, and $X$ and $Z$ are the Pauli operators. Alice's measurement projects the system onto one of the four states, with the outcome being two classical bits, $a$ and $b$, each occurring with probability $1/4$. To reconstruct the original state $|\\psi\\rangle$, Alice sends her measurement outcome $(a,b)$ to Bob. Upon receiving the bits, say $(a',b')$, Bob applies the correction operator $U_{corr} = Z^{a'}X^{b'}$ to his qubit.\n\nIn the ideal scenario, the classical channel is perfect, so $(a',b')=(a,b)$, and Bob perfectly recovers the state $|\\psi\\rangle$. Consider a scenario where the two classical bits are transmitted from Alice to Bob through two independent, identical noisy channels. The channel is a Z-channel, which is an asymmetric binary channel with error parameter $\\epsilon$. For a single bit $x$ sent through the Z-channel, the received bit $y$ follows these probabilities:\n- $P(y=0|x=0) = 1$\n- $P(y=1|x=0) = 0$\n- $P(y=0|x=1) = \\epsilon$\n- $P(y=1|x=1) = 1-\\epsilon$\nThis means a '0' is always transmitted correctly, but a '1' is flipped to a '0' with probability $\\epsilon$.\n\nYour task is to calculate the average teleportation fidelity, $F_{avg}$. The average fidelity is the fidelity $F = \\langle\\psi|\\rho_{out}|\\psi\\rangle$ averaged uniformly over all possible input pure states $|\\psi\\rangle$ on the Bloch sphere, where $\\rho_{out}$ is the final density matrix of Bob's qubit after the entire process.", "solution": "The average teleportation fidelity $ F_{\\text{avg}} $ is calculated by averaging the fidelity $ F = \\langle \\psi | \\rho_{\\text{out}} | \\psi \\rangle $ over all input states $ |\\psi\\rangle $ on the Bloch sphere and over the measurement outcomes and channel errors.\n\nThe correction operator applied by Bob is $ U_{\\text{corr}} = Z^{a'} X^{b'} $, where $ (a', b') $ are the received bits.
