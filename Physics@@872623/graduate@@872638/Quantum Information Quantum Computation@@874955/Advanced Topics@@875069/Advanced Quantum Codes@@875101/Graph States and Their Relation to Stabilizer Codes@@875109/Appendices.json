A graph state $|\\psi_G\\rangle$ is an $n$-qubit state defined by a simple graph $G=(V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of $n$ vertices (representing qubits) and $E$ is the set of edges.\n\nThis state is uniquely defined (up to a global phase) as the simultaneous `+1` eigenstate of a set of $n$ commuting operators $\\{K_i\\}_{i \\in V}$ called stabilizer generators. For each vertex $i \\in V$, the generator $K_i$ is given by:\n$$ K_i = X_i \\prod_{j \\in N(i)} Z_j $$\nwhere $X_i$ and $Z_j$ are the Pauli operators acting on qubits $i$ and $j$ respectively, and $N(i)$ is the set of neighbors of vertex $i$ in the graph $G$. The set of all products of these generators forms the stabilizer group $\\mathcal{S}$, and the graph code is the 1-dimensional subspace stabilized by $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nWhen an error, represented by a Pauli operator $E$, occurs on the state, we can detect it by measuring the eigenvalues of the stabilizer generators. This measurement yields a classical syndrome vector $s \\in \\{0, 1\\}^n$. The $i$-th bit of the syndrome, $s_i$, is $0$ if $[K_i, E] = K_i E - E K_i = 0$ (they commute), and $s_i=1$ if $\\{K_i, E\\} = K_i E + E K_i = 0$ (they anti-commute). The Hamming weight of the syndrome, $w_H(s)$, is the number of non-zero bits in $s$.\n\nConsider the graph $G$ corresponding to the vertices and edges of a dodecahedron. A dodecahedron has 20 vertices, 30 edges, and its faces are 12 regular pentagons. The graph is 3-regular, meaning every vertex is connected to exactly three other vertices.
