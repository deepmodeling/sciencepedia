This practice will help you build intuition for how an error syndrome manifests in the geometric language of color codes.", "problem": "The `[[15,1,3]]` Reed-Muller code is a type of 3D color code that offers fault-tolerant properties. While it can be constructed algebraically, it also admits a highly symmetric geometric interpretation based on the projective space $PG(3,2)$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_2$. In this geometric view, the 15 physical qubits of the code correspond to the 15 points of $PG(3,2)$.\n\nThe geometry of $PG(3,2)$ is defined by a set of points $\\mathcal{P}$ and a set of planes $\\mathcal{F}$.\nThe key properties of this geometry are as follows:\n1.  There are 15 points and 15 planes: $|\\mathcal{P}| = 15$, $|\\mathcal{F}| = 15$.\n2.  Each plane is a set of 7 points.\n3.  Any two distinct points are contained in exactly 3 common planes.\n4.  The geometry is symmetric: all points are equivalent, and all planes are equivalent.\n\nIn this model of the `[[15,1,3]]` color code, the \"face stabilizers\" are X-type Pauli operators associated with the planes of $PG(3,2)$. For each plane $P \\in \\mathcal{F}$, there is a face stabilizer $A_P$ given by the product of Pauli-X operators acting on all qubits (points) within that plane:\n$$A_P = \\prod_{q \\in P} X_q$$\nwhere $X_q$ is the Pauli-X operator on the qubit corresponding to point $q$. The term \"cubic\" in the problem description refers to one possible physical layout of these 15 qubits (e.g., 8 at the vertices of a cube, 6 at the face centers, and 1 at the body center), but the stabilizer definitions rely on the abstract and more symmetric incidence relations of $PG(3,2)$.\n\nAssume a single-qubit Pauli-Z error $E = Z_q$ occurs on an arbitrary qubit $q \\in \\mathcal{P}$. A stabilizer is violated if it anticommutes with the error operator. Your task is to find the total number of face stabilizers that are violated by this single error.", "solution": "1. A face stabilizer for a plane $P$ is \n\n$$\nA_P = \\prod_{q'\\in P} X_{q'}.\n$$\n\n2.
