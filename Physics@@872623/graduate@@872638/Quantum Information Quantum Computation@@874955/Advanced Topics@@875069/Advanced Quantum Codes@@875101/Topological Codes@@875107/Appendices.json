Data qubits are typically associated with the edges of the lattice. The stabilizer group is generated by two types of local operators: vertex operators (often called star operators) and plaquette operators. For a code with Z-type errors, the relevant stabilizers are the vertex operators $\\{A_v\\}$, where $A_v = \\prod_{i \\in \\text{star}(v)} X_i$ is the product of Pauli-X operators on all qubits (edges) meeting at a vertex $v$.\n\nA string of Pauli-Z errors $E = \\prod_{k \\in \\mathcal{E}} Z_k$ on a set of qubits $\\mathcal{E}$ creates a syndrome, which is detected by measuring the stabilizers. A vertex $v$ is part of the syndrome if the operator $A_v$ anticommutes with $E$. This occurs if an odd number of edges incident on $v$ are in the error set $\\mathcal{E}$. Thus, the syndrome of a Z-error string consists of the endpoints of the string.\n\nA common decoding strategy for the planar code is the minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) algorithm. Given a syndrome, the decoder finds the lowest-weight error operator $C$ that could have produced it. This $C$ is then applied as a correction. A logical error occurs if the combination of the original error $E$ and the correction $C$ results in a net non-trivial logical operator $\\bar{L}$, i.e., $C \\cdot E = \\bar{L} \\not\\propto I$. This happens if the decoder is \"fooled\" by the error $E$; specifically, if there is another error operator $E'$ with the same syndrome as $E$ but with a smaller weight. In this case, the decoder applies $C = E'$, and the resulting operator is $\\bar{L} = E' \\cdot E$.\n\nConsider a planar code with a code distance of $d=3$. This means the minimum weight of any non-trivial logical operator is 3. Suppose a correlated Pauli-Z error $E = Z_i Z_j$ occurs on two distinct data qubits $i$ and $j$.

A logical error occurs if the decoder applies a correction $C$ such that the net effect $C \\cdot E$ is a non-trivial logical operator, $\\bar{L}$. This happens if an error $E$ has the same syndrome as a lower-weight operator $C$, causing the Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder to choose $C$ for correction.\n\n2.  Let the error be a two-qubit operator $E=Z_i Z_j$, which has weight $w(E)=2$. For the decoder to fail, there must be an operator $C$ with the same syndrome as $E$ but with $w(C)  w(E)$. The minimum possible non-zero weight for an operator is 1, so let's assume such a correction $C=Z_k$ exists for some single qubit $k$.\n\n3.  If $E$ and $C$ have the same syndrome, then their product $\\bar{L} = C \\cdot E = Z_k \\cdot Z_i Z_j$ must have zero syndrome (i.e., it must commute with all stabilizers). An operator with zero syndrome that is not a product of stabilizers is, by definition, a non-trivial logical operator.\n\n4.  This scenario is possible if the code contains a logical operator of weight 3. A code with distance $d=3$ is defined as having a minimum logical operator weight of 3, so such an operator $\\bar{L} = Z_i Z_j Z_k$ can exist.\n\n5.  If this is the case, consider what happens when the error $E=Z_i Z_j$ occurs. Its syndrome is identical to the syndrome of the single-qubit error $C=Z_k$, because $E = \\bar{L} \\cdot C^{-1} = \\bar{L} \\cdot Z_k$ and $\\bar{L}$ is syndrome-free.\n\n6.  The decoder sees the syndrome and identifies the minimum-weight error that could cause it, which is $C=Z_k$ (since $w(C)=1  w(E)=2$). It then applies this correction.\n\n7.  The net operator applied to the logical state is $C \\cdot E = \\bar{L}$. The weight of this logical operator is $w(\\bar{L})=3$, assuming qubits $i, j, k$ are distinct.\n\n8.
