This problem challenges you to compute the GSD of the toric code on a fractal structure, the Sierpinski carpet, which possesses a rich topology. By relating the number of logical qubits to the number of 'holes' in the fractal, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the truly topological nature of these systems.", "problem": "The toric code is a stabilizer quantum error-correcting code typically defined on a two-dimensional square lattice with periodic boundary conditions. However, the model can be generalized to any 2D cell complex, which is a graph embedded on a surface, defining faces (plaquettes). In this generalized toric code, qubits are located on the edges of the complex. The stabilizer group is generated by two types of operators:\n1.  Star operators: For each vertex $v$, an operator $A_v = \\prod_{e \\sim v} Z_e$, where the product is over all edges $e$ incident to $v$, and $Z_e$ is the Pauli-Z operator on the qubit on edge $e$.\n2.  Plaquette operators: For each face $p$, an operator $B_p = \\prod_{e \\in \\partial p} X_e$, where the product is over all edges $e$ on the boundary of $p$, and $X_e$ is the Pauli-X operator on the qubit on edge $e$.\n\nThe ground states of the system are the states $|\\psi\\rangle$ that are stabilized by all generators, i.e., $A_v |\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle$ and $B_p |\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle$ for all $v$ and $p$. The number of encoded logical qubits is determined by the topology of the cell complex. For a code defined on a surface with genus $g$ and $b$ boundaries (holes), with open boundary conditions as defined above, the number of logical qubits is $k_{logical} = 2g + b - 1$. The ground state degeneracy is then $2^{k_{logical}}$.\n\nThe Sierpinski carpet is a fractal constructed iteratively. The $k$-th stage approximation of the carpet, denoted $S_k$, can be viewed as a 2D cell complex. The construction starts with a single solid square for $k=0$. To get from stage $k$ to $k+1$, every square in the complex $S_k$ is subdivided into a $3 \\times 3$ grid of smaller squares, and the central square of each grid is removed. $S_0$ is a single square, $S_1$ is a square with a central square hole, $S_2$ is composed of 8 squares-with-holes, forming a larger structure with a total of 9 holes of different sizes, and so on.\n\nConsider a toric code defined on the cell complex of the $k$-th stage Sierpinski carpet $S_k$.
