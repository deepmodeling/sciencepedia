The evolution of the state under a Clifford gate $U$ is tracked by the evolution of the generators of $S$. The Gottesman-Knill theorem asserts that this evolution can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer.\n\nA key tool for this simulation is the representation of Pauli operators in a $2n$-dimensional phase space over the field $\\mathbb{F}_2$. A Pauli operator $P = \\gamma \\prod_{k=1}^n X_k^{x_k} Z_k^{z_k}$, where $\\gamma$ is a phase factor and $X_k, Z_k$ are the Pauli matrices on qubit $k$, can be represented by a binary vector $v = (x_1, \\dots, x_n, z_1, \\dots, z_n)$.\n\nThe action of a Clifford gate $U$ on the basis generators of the Pauli algebra, $\\{X_1, \\dots, X_n, Z_1, \\dots, Z_n\\}$, is given by a transformation $U g_i U^\\dagger = \\gamma_i g'_i$, where $g_i \\in \\{X_k, Z_k\\}$ and $g'_i$ is another Pauli operator. The transformation from the basis $\\{g_i\\}$ to $\\{g'_i\\}$ is described by a $2n \\times 2n$ symplectic matrix $S_U$ with entries in $\\mathbb{F}_2$. If we order the basis generators as $g = (X_1, \\dots, X_n, Z_1, \\dots, Z_n)^T$, the transformed generators $g'$ are specified by the phase space vectors which form the rows of $S_U$. Specifically, the $i$-th row of $S_U$ is the phase space vector corresponding to the Pauli operator $g'_i$. The overall transformation of the circuit $U = U_k \\dots U_2 U_1$ is given by the matrix product $S_U = S_{U_k} \\dots S_{U_2} S_{U_1}$.\n\nFor a two-qubit system ($n=2$), the phase space vectors are 4-dimensional, $(x_1, x_2, z_1, z_2)$, and the symplectic matrices are $4 \\times 4$.

An error can be represented by a quantum operator, typically a Pauli operator, acting on the state of the system.

This is equivalent to the original state evolving to $U|\\psi\\rangle$ and being affected by a new, propagated error $E_{out}$. The relationship between the initial error $E_{in}$ and the propagated error $E_{out}$ is given by the conjugation of $E_{in}$ by the circuit's unitary operator $U$:\n$$E_{out} = U E_{in} U^\\dagger$$\n\nThis problem concerns a three-qubit system.
