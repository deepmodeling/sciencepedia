Due to its nature, it cannot be implemented transversally in many standard error-correcting codes, such as the surface code. A common method for its implementation is gate teleportation using a \"magic state\" ancilla.\n\nConsider a fault-tolerant T-gate application on a logical qubit. The procedure involves a logical Bell measurement on the data qubit (in an arbitrary logical state $\\rho$) and an ancilla qubit prepared in the magic state $|A\\rangle_L = T_L H_L |0\\rangle_L$, where $T_L$ and $H_L$ are the logical T and Hadamard gates, respectively.

Specifically, the state becomes $P_m T_L \\rho T_L^\\dagger P_m^\\dagger$, where $P_m = Z_L^{m_1} X_L^{m_2}$ is the corresponding logical Pauli operator.\n\nTo complete the gate application, a classical correction $C_m = P_m^\\dagger = P_m$ is applied, conditioned on the measurement outcome $m$. The two classical bits, $m_1$ and $m_2$, are transmitted to the correction controller.\n\nNow, suppose the classical communication channel for the bit $m_2$ is faulty and suffers from a \"stuck-at-0\" error. This means that if the true measurement outcome is $m_2=1$, the channel transmits $m'_2=0$. If the true outcome is $m_2=0$, it correctly transmits $m'_2=0$. The channel for $m_1$ is perfect. Consequently, the applied correction is $C_{m'} = P_{m'} = Z_L^{m_1} X_L^{m'_2} = Z_L^{m_1}$.\n\nThis fault transforms the overall operation from an ideal T-gate into a new quantum process, $\\mathcal{E}$.
