In this scheme, an initial physical error rate $p$ is reduced at each level of encoding. The logical error rate after one level of encoding, $p_{log}$, can be expressed as a function of the physical error rate, $p_{log} = f(p)$. For $k$ levels of concatenation, the error rate is given by the recursive relation $p_k = f(p_{k-1}) = f^{(k)}(p)$, where $p_0 = p$.\n\nFor fault tolerance to be possible, the error rate must decrease with each level of concatenation, i.e., $p_{k+1}  p_k$.
