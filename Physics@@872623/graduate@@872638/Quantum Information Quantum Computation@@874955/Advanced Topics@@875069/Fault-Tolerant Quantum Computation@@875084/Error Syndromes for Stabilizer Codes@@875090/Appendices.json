These operators are called the stabilizer generators.\n\nThe [[7,1,3]] Steane code is a quantum error-correcting code that encodes one logical qubit into seven physical qubits. It is a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code, and its stabilizer group can be generated by the following six operators, where $X_j$ and $Z_j$ are the Pauli-X and Pauli-Z operators acting on qubit $j$:\n$S_1 = Z_1 Z_3 Z_5 Z_7$\n$S_2 = Z_2 Z_3 Z_6 Z_7$\n$S_3 = Z_4 Z_5 Z_6 Z_7$\n$S_4 = X_1 X_3 X_5 X_7$\n$S_5 = X_2 X_3 X_6 X_7$\n$S_6 = X_4 X_5 X_6 X_7$\n\nWhen a Pauli error $E$ occurs, it may or may not commute with the stabilizer generators. The error syndrome is a classical bit string that records this information. For each generator $S_i$, the corresponding syndrome bit $s_i$ is 0 if $E$ commutes with $S_i$ (i.e., $E S_i = S_i E$) and 1 if $E$ anti-commutes with $S_i$ (i.e., $E S_i = -S_i E$). The full error syndrome is the vector $\\mathbf{s} = (s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4, s_5, s_6)$.\n\nConsider the two-qubit Pauli error $E = X_2 Z_5$.

Two Pauli strings $P_A = \\bigotimes_{j=1}^n \\sigma_{A,j}$ and $P_B = \\bigotimes_{j=1}^n \\sigma_{B,j}$ commute if they anti-commute on an even number of qubits, and they anti-commute if they anti-commute on an odd number of qubits.
