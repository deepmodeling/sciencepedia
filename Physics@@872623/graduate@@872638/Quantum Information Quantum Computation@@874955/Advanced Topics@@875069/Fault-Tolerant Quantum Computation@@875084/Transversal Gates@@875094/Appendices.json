This exercise provides a foundational example of this limitation, as described by the Eastin-Knill theorem, by examining the effect of a transversal non-Clifford T-gate on the Steane code [@problem_id:181538]. By calculating the resulting fidelity, you will quantify how this \"leaky\" operation takes the state out of the protected codespace, a crucial concept in the design of universal fault-tolerant gate sets.", "problem": "In the theory of fault-tolerant quantum computation, transversal gates are logical operations that can be implemented by applying single-qubit gates to each physical qubit of an encoded state. While transversal implementations exist for Clifford group gates in many stabilizer codes, non-Clifford gates like the T-gate often pose a challenge. A transversal application of a non-Clifford gate may take a state out of the codespace, introducing errors.\n\nConsider the Steane code, a [[7, 1, 3]] quantum error-correcting code. It is a CSS code derived from the classical [7,4,3] Hamming code, which we denote as $C_H$. The logical plus state, $|+\\rangle_L$, can be expressed as an equal superposition of all codewords in the dual code of $C_H$, denoted $C_H^\\perp$. The dual code $C_H^\\perp$ is a [7,3,4] linear code, meaning it is a vector space of dimension 3 over the field $\\mathbb{F}_2$ and contains $2^3 = 8$ codewords. A key property of $C_H^\\perp$ is that it contains the all-zero codeword, `0000000` (with Hamming weight 0), and the remaining seven non-zero codewords all have a Hamming weight of 4.\n\nThe logical plus state is therefore given by:\n$$\n|+\\rangle_L = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}} \\sum_{c \\in C_H^\\perp} |c\\rangle\n$$\nwhere the sum is over all 8 bit-strings $c$ in the code $C_H^\\perp$, and $|c\\rangle$ is the corresponding 7-qubit computational basis state.\n\nThe single-qubit T-gate is defined by its action on the computational basis states: $T|0\\rangle = |0\\rangle$ and $T|1\\rangle = e^{i\\pi/4}|1\\rangle$. In matrix form, this is:\n$$\nT = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & e^{i\\pi/4} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nA transversal T-gate operation on the 7-qubit Steane code is given by $U_T = T^{\\otimes 7}$. When this operation is applied to the logical plus state, the resulting state is $|\\psi\\rangle = U_T |+\\rangle_L$. This new state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is generally no longer in the codespace.\n\nCalculate the fidelity of the logical plus state after the transversal T-gate application, which is defined as the squared magnitude of the overlap between the initial and final states, $F = |\\langle +|_L | \\psi \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle +|_L T^{\\otimes 7} |+\\rangle_L|^2$.
