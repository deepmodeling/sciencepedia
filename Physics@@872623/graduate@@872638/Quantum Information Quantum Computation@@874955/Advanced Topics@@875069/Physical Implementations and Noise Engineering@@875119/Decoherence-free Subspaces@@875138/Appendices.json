This type of noise is described by an interaction with the environment that is symmetric with respect to all qubits and is mediated by an operator proportional to the total spin operator along the z-axis, $S_z = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sigma_z^{(i)}$. Here, $\\sigma_z^{(i)}$ is the Pauli-Z operator acting on the $i$-th qubit.\n\nA decoherence-free subspace (DFS) for this noise model is a subspace $\\mathcal{H}_{DFS}$ of the total Hilbert space where all states are immune to the noise. For collective dephasing, this condition is satisfied if all states $|\\psi\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{H}_{DFS}$ are degenerate eigenvectors of the collective noise operator $S_z$.

This requires the construction of a three-dimensional decoherence-free subspace.\n\nWhat is the minimal number of physical qubits, $N$, required to construct such a three-dimensional DFS to encode one logical qutrit against collective dephasing noise?", "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum number of physical qubits, $N$, required to create a 3-dimensional decoherence-free subspace (DFS) for collective dephasing noise.\n\nThe collective noise operator is given by $S_z = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sigma_z^{(i)}$. The condition for a subspace to be a DFS is that it must be a subspace of a single eigenspace of $S_z$. To encode a logical qutrit, we need this DFS to be at least 3-dimensional. Therefore, we need to find the smallest integer $N$ for which the operator $S_z$ has an eigenspace with a dimension of 3 or greater.\n\nLet's analyze the eigenspaces of $S_z$. The Hilbert space of a single qubit is spanned by the eigenstates of $\\sigma_z$, which are here denoted by $|0\\rangle$ (eigenvalue +1) and $|1\\rangle$ (eigenvalue -1). The Hilbert space for the $N$-qubit system is spanned by the computational basis states $|x_1 x_2 \\dots x_N\\rangle$, where $x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. These basis states are also eigenstates of $S_z$.\n\nLet a computational basis state have $n_0$ qubits in the state $|0\\rangle$ and $n_1$ qubits in the state $|1\\rangle$.

This means they must all have the same number of qubits in state $|0\\rangle$ (and consequently, in state $|1\\rangle$).\nFor a fixed $N$, the values of $n_0$ and $n_1$ determine the eigenvalue $s_z$. Conversely, for a given eigenvalue $s_z$, we have two equations:\n1. $n_0 + n_1 = N$\n2. $n_0 - n_1 = s_z$\n\nSolving for $n_0$ and $n_1$ gives $n_0 = (N+s_z)/2$ and $n_1 = (N-s_z)/2$.\n\nThe dimension of the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue $s_z$ is the number of distinct computational basis states with the required $n_0$ and $n_1$. This is equivalent to the number of ways to arrange $n_1$ qubits in state $|1\\rangle$ among $N$ total positions. This is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{N}{n_1}$. So, the dimension of the eigenspace is $D(N, n_1) = \\binom{N}{n_1}$.\n\nWe are looking for the smallest integer $N \\ge 1$ such that there exists an integer $n_1$ (with $0 \\le n_1 \\le N$) for which the dimension of the eigenspace is at least 3.\n$$ \\max_{0 \\le n_1 \\le N} \\binom{N}{n_1} \\ge 3 $$\n\nLet's test values of $N$ sequentially:\n-   **For N=1:** The possible values for $n_1$ are 0 and 1.\n    -   $\\binom{1}{0} = 1$\n    -   $\\binom{1}{1} = 1$\n    The maximum dimension of an eigenspace is 1.
