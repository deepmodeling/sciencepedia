This is equivalent to finding the number of normalizable solutions to the system of linear equations $\\sum_{j \\sim i} \\phi_j = 0$ for every site $i$ of the modified lattice.\n\n1.  **Bipartite Nature of the Lattice**\n\n    A perfect honeycomb lattice is bipartite. This means its vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets, $V_A$ and $V_B$, such that every edge in the lattice connects a vertex in $V_A$ to one in $V_B$. There are no edges connecting two vertices from the same set. This property is equivalent to the absence of any odd-membered cycles (loops). The smallest cycle in a perfect honeycomb lattice is a hexagon, which has an even number of vertices (6).\n\n2.  **Introducing the Defect and Breaking Bipartiteness**\n\n    When a hexagonal plaquette is replaced by a pentagonal one, we introduce a 5-cycle. This is an odd-membered cycle, which means the lattice is no longer bipartite. We can see this by attempting to color the vertices with two colors (A and B). Let's label the vertices of the pentagon sequentially as $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5$. If we assign $v_1$ to sublattice $V_A$, its neighbor $v_2$ must be in $V_B$. Continuing around the ring, $v_3$ must be in $V_A$, $v_4$ in $V_B$, and $v_5$ in $V_A$. However, $v_5$ is connected to $v_1$, and both are assigned to $V_A$. This bond, $(v_1, v_5)$, violates the bipartite condition. We can define a \"best-effort\" bipartition $V=V_A \\cup V_B$ where only this single link, which we'll call the \"frustrated link,\" connects two vertices within the same sublattice (here, $V_A$).\n\n3.  **Sum Rules from the Zero-Mode Condition**\n\n    Let $\\phi$ be the vector of coefficients of a zero-energy mode, satisfying $\\sum_{j \\sim i} \\phi_j = 0$ for all sites $i$. Let's sum this equation over all sites in our \"best-effort\" sublattice $V_A$.\n    $$ \\sum_{i \\in V_A} \\left( \\sum_{j \\sim i} \\phi_j \\right) = 0 $$\n    This sum can be interpreted as a sum over all edges that have at least one endpoint in $V_A$.\n    - For a non-frustrated edge $(i,j)$ with $i \\in V_A$ and $j \\in V_B$, the term $\\phi_j$ appears in the sum for site $i$.\n    - For the single frustrated edge $(v_1, v_5)$ with both sites in $V_A$, the term $\\phi_{v_5}$ appears in the sum for site $v_1$, and $\\phi_{v_1}$ appears in the sum for site $v_5$.\n    The total sum can therefore be written as:\n    $$ \\left( \\sum_{(i,j) \\in E_{AB}} \\phi_j \\right) + (\\phi_{v_1} + \\phi_{v_5}) = 0 $$\n    where $E_{AB}$ is the set of non-frustrated edges connecting $V_A$ and $V_B$, and the first term sums the $\\phi$ coefficients on the $V_B$ side of these edges.\n\n4.  **Constraint on the Zero-Mode Solution**\n\n    For a localized (normalizable) mode on an infinite lattice that is bipartite far from the defect, the wavefunction must decay at infinity. A known property of zero modes on bipartite graphs, which can be derived rigorously, implies that certain sums of wavefunction coefficients across the two sublattices must vanish. In our case, this property requires the sum over the non-frustrated links to be zero: $\\sum_{(i,j) \\in E_{AB}} \\phi_j = 0$.\n    \n    Applying this powerful constraint to our sum rule derived from the $V_A$ sublattice leaves a simple, local condition on the coefficients at the frustrated link:\n    $$ 0 + (\\phi_{v_1} + \\phi_{v_5}) = 0 \\implies \\phi_{v_1} + \\phi_{v_5} = 0 $$\n    This means any localized zero-energy mode must have coefficients of equal magnitude and opposite sign on the two vertices of the frustrated link.\n\n5.  **Counting the Modes**\n\n    The existence of such a strong, local constraint dramatically reduces the space of possible solutions. While a full proof requires more advanced techniques (like Green's function methods or an index theorem), this constraint is the essential feature. It can be shown that there is exactly one linearly independent, normalizable solution to the zero-mode equations that satisfies this local constraint. The pentagonal defect essentially \"traps\" a single mode that would otherwise be a delocalized edge state of a cut-open lattice.\n\n    Therefore, there is exactly one Majorana zero-energy mode bound to the disclination.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1} $$", "id": "99096"}]}
