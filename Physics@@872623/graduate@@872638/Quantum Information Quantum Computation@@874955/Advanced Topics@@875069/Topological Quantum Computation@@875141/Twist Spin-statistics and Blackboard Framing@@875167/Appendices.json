These operators are associated with links embedded in a 3-manifold. The expectation value for a link $L$ depends not only on its topology (i.e., its knot type) but also on its **framing**. A framing corresponds to choosing a non-zero normal vector field along the link, effectively thickening the one-dimensional link into a ribbon. This property is connected to the concept of the topological spin of the anyonic particles whose worldlines form the link.\n\nA common and practical method for specifying a framing for a link diagram $D$ projected onto a plane is the **blackboard framing**. For a single-component link (a knot) whose diagram has no self-tangencies or \"curls\" (i.e., no trivial loops created by a Type I Reidemeister move), the blackboard framing is given by an integer equal to the **writhe** of the diagram, denoted $w(D)$.\n\nThe writhe is defined as the sum of the signs of all crossings in the diagram, $w(D) = \\sum_{c} \\epsilon(c)$. The sign $\\epsilon(c)$ of a crossing $c$ is determined by a standard convention based on the orientation of the strands.\n- A crossing is **positive** ($\\epsilon = +1$) if the over-passing strand can be rotated counter-clockwise by less than 180 degrees to align with the under-passing strand.\n- A crossing is **negative** ($\\epsilon = -1$) if the over-passing strand must be rotated clockwise to align with the under-passing strand.\n\nConsider a knot diagram $D$ on the plane. A local \"surgical\" operation is performed, which consists of a **crossing change** at a single point. This operation switches the over-strand with the under-strand. This is not a Reidemeister move and in general changes the topological type of the knot.\n\nSuppose we start with a diagram $D$ and perform a crossing change at one of its crossings, which is initially a positive crossing. Let the new diagram be denoted by $D'$. This modification inverts the local chiral structure of the knot at that specific point. Calculate the integer change in the blackboard framing, $\\Delta w = w(D') - w(D)$, that results from this operation.", "solution": "The writhe $w(D)$ is defined as the sum of the signs of all crossings in the diagram $D$:\n$$ w(D) = \\sum_{c} \\epsilon(c) $$\nwhere $\\epsilon(c)$ is the sign of crossing $c$, with $\\epsilon(c) = +1$ for a positive crossing and $\\epsilon(c) = -1$ for a negative crossing.\n\nLet the crossing where the operation is performed be denoted $c$. Initially, $c$ is positive, so $\\epsilon(c) = +1$ in diagram $D$.\n\nAfter the crossing change, the over-strand and under-strand are switched. This operation inverts the sign of $c$. Therefore, in the new diagram $D'$, the sign of $c$ is $\\epsilon'(c) = -\\epsilon(c) = -1$.\n\nThe signs of all other crossings remain unchanged.
