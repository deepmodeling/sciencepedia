[@problem_id:46363]", "problem": "A $Z_N$ toric code is a topological quantum error-correcting code defined on a two-dimensional lattice on a torus. Its elementary excitations, known as anyons, are described by a theory with a $Z_N \\times Z_N$ group structure. The anyon types can be labeled as $e^k m^l$, where $e$ is the elementary electric charge and $m$ is the elementary magnetic flux. The labels $k, l$ are integers modulo $N$, i.e., $k, l \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$. The trivial anyon, or vacuum, corresponds to $k=l=0$.\n\nThe defining characteristic of anyons is their braiding statistics. When an anyon $a = e^{k_a} m^{l_a}$ is braided in a full counter-clockwise loop around another anyon $b = e^{k_b} m^{l_b}$, the wavefunction acquires a statistical phase factor $e^{i\\theta_{ab}}$, where the statistical angle is given by:\n$$\n\\theta_{ab} = \\frac{2\\pi}{N}(k_a l_b - k_b l_a)\n$$\nThe intrinsic statistics of an anyon $a$ is determined by its spin $h_a$, which is related to the phase acquired from a full $2\\pi$ self-rotation, $e^{i2\\pi h_a}$. For an anyon $a=e^k m^l$, the spin is given by $h_a = \\frac{kl}{N} \\pmod 1$. An anyon is a boson if its spin is an integer, and a fermion if its spin is a half-integer.\n\nUnder certain conditions, a bosonic anyon can undergo condensation, a process where it proliferates and becomes part of the new vacuum. Let $c$ be a bosonic anyon that condenses. This leads to a new topological phase with a different set of anyonic excitations. The rules governing the transition are as follows:\n1.  **Confinement**: Any anyon $a$ that has a non-trivial braiding with the condensed anyon $c$ (i.e., $\\theta_{ac} \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{2\\pi}$) becomes confined. Confined anyons require infinite energy to separate and are not observable as individual quasiparticles. The deconfined anyons are those that braid trivially with $c$.\n2.  **Identification**: The deconfined anyons are subject to a new equivalence relation. An anyon $a$ is identified with the anyon $a \\cdot c$, where $\\cdot$ denotes the group multiplication law of the anyons ($e^{k_1}m^{l_1} \\cdot e^{k_2}m^{l_2} = e^{k_1+k_2}m^{l_1+l_2}$).\n\nConsider a $Z_8$ toric code.
