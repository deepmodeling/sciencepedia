Its elementary excitations are abelian anyons: the electric charge $e$, the magnetic flux $m$, and their composite, the dyon $\\epsilon=em$. The ground state degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code depends on the topology of the manifold on which it is defined. For the purposes of this problem, you may take the following as given: on a Mobius strip, the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code has a GSD of 2. The two-dimensional ground state space $\\mathcal{H}_{\\text{GS}}$ can be spanned by two orthonormal states, $\\{|\\psi_1\\rangle, |\\psi_e\\rangle\\}$. These basis states can be understood as arising from the two sectors of the parent theory on a cylinder that are invariant under the glide reflection that turns the cylinder into a Mobius strip, corresponding to the identity (1) and electric ($e$) anyon flux propagating along the cylinder.\n\nNow, consider this system in the presence of a global on-site $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, represented by a unitary operator $U$. This symmetry enriches the topological order, leading to a symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phase. The defining characteristic of this SET phase is how the symmetry acts on the anyons. We specify that the symmetry fractionalizes non-trivially on the electric anyon $e$. This means that a state with an isolated $e$ anyon is not invariant under the symmetry operation, but instead transforms projectively, acquiring a phase of $-1$. The magnetic anyon $m$, in contrast, transforms trivially (with a phase of $+1$). The identity anyon $1$ is always invariant. The transformation property of the dyon $\\epsilon$ is determined by the fusion rules.

The state $|\\psi_a\\rangle$ represents a ground state with a non-trivial flux of type $a$ through the non-contractible loop of the Mobius strip. The symmetry operator $U$ acts diagonally on this basis:\n    $$\n    U |\\psi_a\\rangle = Q_a |\\psi_a\\rangle\n    $$\n    where $Q_a$ is the phase acquired by an isolated anyon of type $a$ under the action of $U$. This phase $Q_a$ is also referred to as the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry charge of the anyon $a$.\n\n4.  **Use the Specified Fractionalization Pattern:**\n    The problem specifies the symmetry fractionalization pattern as follows:\n    -   The identity anyon $1$ is always invariant: $Q_1 = 1$.\n    -   The electric anyon $e$ transforms non-trivially: $Q_e = -1$.\n    -   The magnetic anyon $m$ transforms trivially: $Q_m = 1$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Action of U on the Basis States:**\n    Now we apply this to our basis $\\{|\\psi_1\\rangle, |\\psi_e\\rangle\\}$:\n    -   For the state $|\\psi_1\\rangle$, which corresponds to the identity anyon flux:\n        $$\n        U |\\psi_1\\rangle = Q_1 |\\psi_1\\rangle = (1) |\\psi_1\\rangle = |\\psi_1\\rangle\n        $$\n    -   For the state $|\\psi_e\\rangle$, which corresponds to the electric anyon flux:\n        $$\n        U |\\psi_e\\rangle = Q_e |\\psi_e\\rangle = (-1) |\\psi_e\\rangle = -|\\psi_e\\rangle\n        $$\n\n6.  **Identify the Invariant Subspace:**\n    We are looking for states $|\\Psi\\rangle = c_1 |\\psi_1\\rangle + c_e |\\psi_e\\rangle$ such that $U|\\Psi\\rangle = |\\Psi\\rangle$.\n    Applying $U$ to $|\\Psi\\rangle$:\n    $$\n    U|\\Psi\\rangle = U(c_1 |\\psi_1\\rangle + c_e |\\psi_e\\rangle) = c_1 (U|\\psi_1\\rangle) + c_e (U|\\psi_e\\rangle)\n    $$\n    $$\n    U|\\Psi\\rangle = c_1 |\\psi_1\\rangle - c_e |\\psi_e\\rangle\n    $$\n    For this to be equal to $|\\Psi\\rangle = c_1 |\\psi_1\\rangle + c_e |\\psi_e\\rangle$, we must have:\n    $$\n    c_1 |\\psi_1\\rangle - c_e |\\psi_e\\rangle = c_1 |\\psi_1\\rangle + c_e |\\psi_e\\rangle\n    $$\n    This implies $2 c_e |\\psi_e\\rangle = 0$, which means $c_e=0$.\n    Therefore, the states invariant under the symmetry $U$ are of the form $|\\Psi\\rangle = c_1 |\\psi_1\\rangle$. This forms a one-dimensional subspace of $\\mathcal{H}_{\\text{GS}}$.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The subspace of symmetric ground states is spanned by the single vector $|\\psi_1\\rangle$.
