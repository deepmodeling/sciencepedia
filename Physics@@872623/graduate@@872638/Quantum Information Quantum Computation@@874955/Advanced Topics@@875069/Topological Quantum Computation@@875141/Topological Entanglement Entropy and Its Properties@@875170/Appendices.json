Consider a quantum system defined on an infinite 2D square lattice, whose properties are motivated by such RK physics and its relation to vertex models.\n\nThe basis states $|C\\rangle$ for this system are assignments of an integer $k_l \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$ to each link $l$ of the lattice, where $N \\geq 2$ is a fixed integer. A basis state is called a \"valid configuration\" if it satisfies a local constraint for every elementary plaquette $p$ on the lattice. The constraint is that the sum of the integers on the four links forming the boundary of the plaquette, $\\partial p$, must be zero modulo $N$:\n$$\n\\sum_{l \\in \\partial p} k_l \\equiv 0 \\pmod{N}\n$$\nThis condition can be interpreted as a generalization of the \"loop\" condition in simpler models; the non-zero values of $k_l$ form a network of conserved $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ currents.

In the operator language of the toric code, the degrees of freedom are qudits of dimension $N$ on each link. There are two types of commuting projectors in the Hamiltonian: star operators $A_s$ centered on vertices $s$, and plaquette operators $B_p$ centered on plaquettes $p$. The state $|\\Psi\\rangle$ is the unique state that is an eigenstate with eigenvalue +1 for all star and plaquette operators. The constraint $\\sum_{l \\in \\partial p} k_l \\equiv 0 \\pmod{N}$ corresponds to the condition $B_p |\\Psi\\rangle = |\\Psi\\rangle$. The equal superposition of all such states is then enforced by the star operators. This confirms that $|\\Psi\\rangle$ is the ground state of a gapped $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ topological phase.\n\n2.  **Topological Entanglement Entropy and Quantum Dimensions:**\n    The topological entanglement entropy $\\gamma_{topo}$ is a universal quantity that characterizes a topological phase. It is related to the total quantum dimension $\\mathcal{D}$ of the anyonic elementary excitations (quasiparticles) of the theory by the formula:\n    $$\n    \\gamma_{topo} = \\ln(\\mathcal{D})\n    $$\n    The total quantum dimension $\\mathcal{D}$ is defined as the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual quantum dimensions $d_a$ of each anyon type $a$:\n    $$\n    \\mathcal{D} = \\sqrt{\\sum_a d_a^2}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Identify the Anyonic Excitations:**\n    The anyonic excitations in $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory are characterized by two labels $(e, m)$, where $e, m \\in \\mathbb{Z}_N = \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$.\n    *   The label $e$ denotes the \"electric charge\". These excitations are created by Wilson line operators and correspond to violations of the vertex (star) term constraints.\n    *   The label $m$ denotes the \"magnetic charge\" or vortex type. These excitations are created by 't Hooft line operators and correspond to violations of the plaquette term constraints, i.e., where $\\sum_{l \\in \\partial p} k_l \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{N}$.\n    The pair $(0,0)$ corresponds to the vacuum (no excitation). In total, there are $N \\times N = N^2$ distinct anyon types.\n\n4.  **Determine the Quantum Dimensions of the Anyons:**\n    The quantum dimension $d_a$ of an anyon of type $a$ relates to the asymptotic growth rate of the Hilbert space of $n$ such anyons. For Abelian anyons, the fusion of two anyons results in a unique, single anyon type. The fusion rules for $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ anyons are given by:\n    $$\n    (e_1, m_1) \\otimes (e_2, m_2) = (e_1 + e_2 \\pmod N, m_1 + m_2 \\pmod N)\n    $$\n    Since the fusion product is always a single anyon type, the theory is Abelian. All Abelian anyons have a quantum dimension of $d_a = 1$.\n    Therefore, for all $N^2$ anyon types $(e,m)$ in the $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ theory, we have $d_{(e,m)} = 1$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Quantum Dimension:**\n    We can now compute the total quantum dimension $\\mathcal{D}$ by summing over all $N^2$ anyon types:\n    $$\n    \\mathcal{D}^2 = \\sum_a d_a^2 = \\sum_{e=0}^{N-1} \\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} d_{(e,m)}^2\n    $$\n    Substituting $d_{(e,m)} = 1$:\n    $$\n    \\mathcal{D}^2 = \\sum_{e=0}^{N-1} \\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} 1^2 = N \\times N = N^2\n    $$\n    Taking the square root gives the total quantum dimension:\n    $$\n    \\mathcal{D} = \\sqrt{N^2} = N\n    $$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Topological Entanglement Entropy:**\n    Finally, we use the formula for $\\gamma_{topo}$:\n    $$\n    \\gamma_{topo} = \\ln(\\mathcal{D}) = \\ln(N)\n    $$\n    The topological entanglement entropy for the given state is $\\ln(N)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\ln(N)}\n$$", "id": "1193038"}, {"introduction": "The value of the topological entanglement entropy depends not only on the intrinsic properties of the topological phase but also on the global topology of the manifold where the system lives.
