The presence of these states leads to a contribution to the supercurrent that is $4\\pi$-periodic in the superconducting phase difference $\\phi$, in addition to the conventional $2\\pi$-periodic Cooper pair current. A physical consequence of this is that the fermion parity of the junction's ground state flips each time the phase $\\phi$ advances by $2\\pi$.
