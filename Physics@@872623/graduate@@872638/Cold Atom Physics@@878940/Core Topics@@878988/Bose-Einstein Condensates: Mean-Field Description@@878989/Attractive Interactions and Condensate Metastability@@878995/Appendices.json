The intra-species interaction strength is given by $g > 0$ for both components, while the inter-species interaction strength is $g_{12}  0$. These parameters are defined such that the mean-field energy density of a component with density $n_i$ is $\\frac{1}{2}gn_i^2$, and the inter-species mean-field energy density is $g_{12}n_1n_2$. We assume the density of the two components are equal, $n_1=n_2=n/2$, where $n$ is the total atomic density.\n\nIn a specific regime, the attractive inter-species interaction can overcome the intra-species repulsion, leading to an effective attraction at the mean-field level. This would normally cause the gas to collapse. However, a repulsive higher-order correction to the energy, known as the Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) correction, can stabilize the system, leading to the formation of a self-bound liquid-like state called a quantum droplet.\n\nThe total energy density $\\mathcal{E}(n)$ of this system, as a function of the total density $n$, is given by the sum of the mean-field and LHY contributions:\n$$ \\mathcal{E}(n) = \\frac{g+g_{12}}{4}n^2 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2m^3}g^{5/2}}{15\\pi^2\\hbar^3} n^{5/2} $$\nFor a droplet to form, the mean-field term must be attractive, so we operate in the regime where $g+g_{12}  0$.
