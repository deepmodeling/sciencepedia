Even at absolute zero, fermions cannot all collapse into the lowest energy state due to the Pauli exclusion principle. This foundational principle gives rise to a purely quantum mechanical pressure known as degeneracy pressure. This first exercise allows you to directly calculate this pressure for a simple, non-interacting system, providing a concrete illustration of how quantum statistics manifest as a macroscopic force [@problem_id:1237360].", "problem": "Consider a non-interacting, homogeneous gas of fermionic atoms of mass $m$, such as Lithium-6 ($^6\\text{Li}$), at absolute zero temperature ($T=0$).

This system is confined to a volume $V$ and has a uniform number density $n=N/V$, where $N$ is the total number of atoms.\n\nThe pressure exerted by such a gas, known as the Pauli pressure or degeneracy pressure, arises purely from the Pauli exclusion principle, which forbids two identical fermions from occupying the same quantum state. This forces particles to occupy higher momentum states, up to the Fermi momentum $p_F$, resulting in a non-zero total energy and pressure even at $T=0$.\n\nThe pressure $P$ can be derived from the total ground-state energy $U$ of the gas using the thermodynamic relation $P = -(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V})_N$.\n\nYour task is to calculate the zero-temperature pressure $P$ of this spin-polarized Fermi gas.

How do disturbances, or sound waves, propagate through this quantum fluid? This practice guides you to derive the speed of sound, a key collective property, from the gas's equation of state. The elegant result reveals a direct link between a macroscopic speed and the microscopic Fermi velocity, demonstrating how the system's collective behavior is dictated by the motion of particles at the Fermi surface [@problem_id:1237361].", "problem": "A degenerate Fermi gas is a state of matter consisting of fermions at temperatures low enough that quantum mechanical effects dominate their behavior. Consider a system of non-interacting spin-1/2 fermions, each with mass $m$, confined to a three-dimensional volume $V$. The energy of a single particle is given by the non-relativistic dispersion relation $\\epsilon(\\mathbf{p}) = \\frac{|\\mathbf{p}|^2}{2m}$. At absolute zero temperature ($T=0$), all energy states up to a maximum energy, the Fermi energy $E_F$, are occupied, and all states above it are empty. The momentum corresponding to this energy is the Fermi momentum, $p_F$, and the associated velocity is the Fermi velocity, $v_F = p_F/m$.\n\nThe propagation of density waves in this medium can be described by a speed of sound, $c_s$. In a fluid, the square of the speed of sound is related to the change in pressure $P$ with respect to a change in mass density $\\rho$.

So, our first step is to find the total energy of the gas.\n\n**1. Density of States**\n\nFor non-interacting spin-1/2 fermions in a 3D box of volume $V$, the number of quantum states in a momentum-space spherical shell of radius $p$ and thickness $dp$ is given by:\n$$d\\mathcal{N}_{states} = 2 \\times \\frac{V \\cdot 4\\pi p^2 dp}{(2\\pi\\hbar)^3}$$\nThe factor of 2 accounts for the two possible spin projections (spin-up and spin-down).

Expressing the result in terms of Fermi Velocity**\n\nThe Fermi velocity $v_F$ is defined through the Fermi energy: $E_F = \\frac{1}{2}mv_F^2$. We also have the expression for $E_F$ in terms of $n$:\n$$E_F = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} (3\\pi^2 n)^{2/3}$$\nEquating the two expressions for $E_F$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}mv_F^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} (3\\pi^2 n)^{2/3} \\implies v_F^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m^2} (3\\pi^2 n)^{2/3}$$\nComparing this with our expression for $c_s^2$:\n$$c_s^2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m^2} (3\\pi^2 n)^{2/3} \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} v_F^2$$\nTaking the square root gives the final result for the speed of sound:\n$$c_s = \\frac{v_F}{\\sqrt{3}}$$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{v_F}{\\sqrt{3}}} $$", "id": "1237361"}, {"introduction": "While the ideal gas model provides essential insights, real-world systems are governed by particle interactions.
