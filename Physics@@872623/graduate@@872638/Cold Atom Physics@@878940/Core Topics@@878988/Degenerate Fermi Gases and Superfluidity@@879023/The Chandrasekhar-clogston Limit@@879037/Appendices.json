We consider a situation where an effective magnetic field, corresponding to a chemical potential difference $h = (\\mu_\\uparrow - \\mu_\\downarrow)/2$, is applied to the gas.\n\nThe Chandrasekhar-Clogston limit describes the critical field $h_c$ at which the system undergoes a first-order quantum phase transition from a balanced, unpolarized superfluid (SF) phase to a normal, fully-polarized (N) phase. At this critical point, the two phases can coexist. We model the energy densities of these two phases, which have the same total particle density $n$, as follows:\n\n1.
