A powerful way to probe this is to calculate the energy cost of imposing a uniform phase gradient, or \"twist,\" on the condensate wavefunction. This exercise applies this core definition to a non-trivial setting—a Bose gas confined to the curved surface of a torus—to reveal that superfluid density is not necessarily a simple scalar. By calculating the energy response to twists along the torus's different cycles, you will demonstrate that it can be an anisotropic tensor, with its structure intimately tied to the system's geometry.

In two dimensions, the mechanism is particularly elegant, involving the thermal unbinding of topological defects.

This analysis will allow you to determine the critical temperature at which free vortices proliferate, destroying the quasi-long-range order of the superfluid phase. The exercise culminates in deriving the universal value of the superfluid density at the transition point, a landmark result connecting thermodynamics, topology, and condensed matter physics. [@problem_id:1271741]", "problem": "A two-dimensional fluid of interacting bosons of mass $m$ can exhibit superfluidity at low temperatures. This phenomenon is related to the phase coherence of the macroscopic wavefunction of the system. The low-energy physics of such a system can be effectively described by a single real field, the phase $\\theta(\\mathbf{r})$ of the boson field. The effective Hamiltonian governing the long-wavelength phase fluctuations is given by the XY model Hamiltonian:\n$$\nH_{ph} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^2r \\, J (\\nabla\\theta)^2\n$$\nwhere the integral is over the area of the system.

Instead, it undergoes a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition from a quasi-ordered state (the superfluid) to a disordered state (the normal fluid). This transition is driven by the unbinding of topological defects known as vortices. A vortex is a point-like defect in the phase field $\\theta(\\mathbf{r})$ around which the phase changes by an integer multiple of $2\\pi$.\n\nThe energy of a single, isolated vortex with winding number $q$ (an integer) in a large circular system of radius $R$ is dominated by a term that diverges logarithmically with the system size:\n$$\nE_v(q) = \\pi J q^2 \\ln(R/a)\n$$\nwhere $a$ is the short-distance cutoff representing the vortex core radius. We neglect the non-divergent core energy.\n\nThe BKT transition can be understood by a simple free-energy argument for the proliferation of free vortices. While creating a vortex costs energy, it also increases the entropy of the system because the vortex can be placed anywhere. The configurational entropy associated with placing a single vortex in a disk of area $A = \\pi R^2$ is approximately:\n$$\nS_v = 2 k_B \\ln(R/a)\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. The free energy to create a single free vortex is $F_v = E_v - T S_v$. The superfluid phase is stable as long as $F_v$ is positive and grows with $R$, suppressing free vortices.
