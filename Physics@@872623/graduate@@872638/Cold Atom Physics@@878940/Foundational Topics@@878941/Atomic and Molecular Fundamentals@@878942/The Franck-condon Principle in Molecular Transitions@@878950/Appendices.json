Consider a diatomic molecule whose vibrational motion along the internuclear separation axis, described by the coordinate $x$, can be approximated as a harmonic oscillator. The molecule is initially in its ground electronic state, $|g\\rangle$, and also in its ground vibrational state, $|\\nu=0\\rangle_g$. The potential energy for this state is given by:\n$$ V_g(x) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2 $$\nHere, $m$ is the reduced mass of the molecule and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the vibration.\n\nAn ultrashort laser pulse causes an electronic transition to an excited state, $|e\\rangle$. The Franck-Condon principle states that this transition is \"vertical,\" meaning it occurs so rapidly that the nuclear position and momentum do not change. The potential energy surface of the excited electronic state is also harmonic and, for simplicity, we assume it has the same vibrational frequency $\\omega$. However, the equilibrium internuclear distance is shifted by a displacement $d$. The excited state potential is therefore:\n$$ V_e(x) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x-d)^2 + E_{el} $$\nwhere $E_{el}$ is the energy difference between the electronic potential minima.\n\nImmediately after the electronic transition, the nuclear wavefunction is that of the initial state, $|\\nu=0\\rangle_g$, but it now evolves under the new potential $V_e(x)$. This new vibrational state can be expressed as a coherent state in the basis of the excited potential's eigenstates.\n\nA key dimensionless parameter that quantifies the strength of this vibronic coupling is the Huang-Rhys factor, $S$. It is defined as the expectation value of the vibrational number operator of the excited state, $\\hat{n}_e$, in the new vibrational state immediately following the transition.\n\nYour task is to calculate the Huang-Rhys factor $S$ for this system.
