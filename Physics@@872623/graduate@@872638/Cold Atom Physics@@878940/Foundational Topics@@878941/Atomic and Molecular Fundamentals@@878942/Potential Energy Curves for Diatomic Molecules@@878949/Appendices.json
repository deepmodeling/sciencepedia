This model, known as a Mie-type potential, includes a term for short-range repulsion and a term for long-range attraction. For a particular hypothetical molecule, this potential energy is given by the function:\n$$V(R) = \\frac{P}{R^{9}} - \\frac{Q}{R^{3}}$$\nwhere $P$ and $Q$ are positive constants that depend on the specific atoms involved. The molecule is stable at its equilibrium internuclear separation, $R_e$, which corresponds to the configuration of minimum potential energy.\n\nDetermine the analytic expression for the equilibrium internuclear separation, $R_e$, in terms of the constants $P$ and $Q$.", "solution": "The equilibrium internuclear separation, $R_e$, corresponds to the value of $R$ for which the potential energy $V(R)$ is at a minimum. To find this minimum, we must first find the critical points of the function $V(R)$ by taking its first derivative with respect to $R$ and setting it equal to zero.\n\nThe potential energy function is given by:\n$$V(R) = \\frac{P}{R^{9}} - \\frac{Q}{R^{3}} = PR^{-9} - QR^{-3}$$\n\nFirst, we compute the first derivative of $V(R)$ with respect to $R$:\n$$\\frac{dV}{dR} = \\frac{d}{dR} \\left( PR^{-9} - QR^{-3} \\right)$$\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, $\\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1}$, we get:\n$$\\frac{dV}{dR} = P(-9)R^{-9-1} - Q(-3)R^{-3-1}$$\n$$\\frac{dV}{dR} = -9PR^{-10} + 3QR^{-4}$$\n\nTo find the equilibrium separation $R_e$, we set this derivative to zero:\n$$\\left. \\frac{dV}{dR} \\right|_{R=R_e} = 0$$\n$$-9PR_e^{-10} + 3QR_e^{-4} = 0$$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $R_e$. We can rearrange the terms as follows:\n$$3QR_e^{-4} = 9PR_e^{-10}$$\nAssuming $R_e \\neq 0$, we can multiply both sides by $R_e^{10}$ to eliminate the negative exponents:\n$$3QR_e^{-4} R_e^{10} = 9P R_e^{-10} R_e^{10}$$\n$$3QR_e^{6} = 9P$$\n\nNext, we isolate $R_e^6$:\n$$R_e^6 = \\frac{9P}{3Q}$$\n$$R_e^6 = \\frac{3P}{Q}$$\n\nFinally, we take the sixth root of both sides to find $R_e$. Since $R$ represents a physical distance, it must be positive, so we only consider the positive real root:\n$$R_e = \\left( \\frac{3P}{Q} \\right)^{1/6}$$\n\nTo confirm that this corresponds to a minimum (and not a maximum or inflection point), we can check the sign of the second derivative, $\\frac{d^2V}{dR^2}$, evaluated at $R=R_e$.\n$$\\frac{d^2V}{dR^2} = \\frac{d}{dR} \\left( -9PR^{-10} + 3QR^{-4} \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{d^2V}{dR^2} = -9P(-10)R^{-11} + 3Q(-4)R^{-5}$$\n$$\\frac{d^2V}{dR^2} = 90PR^{-11} - 12QR^{-5}$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this at $R=R_e$. From our earlier derivation, we know that at $R_e$, $3QR_e^{-4} = 9PR_e^{-10}$, which implies $Q = \\frac{3P}{R_e^6}$. Substituting this expression for $Q$ into the second derivative:\n$$\\left. \\frac{d^2V}{dR^2} \\right|_{R=R_e} = 90PR_e^{-11} - 12 \\left( \\frac{3P}{R_e^6} \\right) R_e^{-5}$$\n$$\\left. \\frac{d^2V}{dR^2} \\right|_{R=R_e} = 90PR_e^{-11} - 36PR_e^{-11}$$\n$$\\left. \\frac{d^2V}{dR^2} \\right|_{R=R_e} = 54PR_e^{-11} = \\frac{54P}{R_e^{11}}$$\nSince $P$ is given as a positive constant and $R_e$ (a physical distance) must be positive, the second derivative is positive. A positive second derivative at a critical point confirms that the potential energy is at a local minimum.
