These equations provide a powerful, semi-classical description of how atomic populations evolve under the competing influences of laser-driven stimulated transitions and natural spontaneous decay. This first practice challenges you to determine the steady-state populations in a three-level cascade system, a common configuration in atomic physics. Solving this problem is a fundamental exercise in setting up and manipulating the balance equations that govern atomic systems at equilibrium.", "problem": "Consider a three-level atom with energy levels $|1\\rangle$, $|2\\rangle$, and $|3\\rangle$, ordered by increasing energy $E_1 < E_2 < E_3$. The atom is interacting with two classical monochromatic laser fields. The first laser is tuned to the $|1\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |2\\rangle$ transition, and the second laser is tuned to the $|2\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |3\\rangle$ transition.\n\nThe interaction with the lasers is modeled by stimulated transition rates. The rate of stimulated absorption from $|1\\rangle$ to $|2\\rangle$ is equal to the rate of stimulated emission from $|2\\rangle$ to $|1\\rangle$, and is denoted by $R_1$. Similarly, the rate for the $|2\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |3\\rangle$ transition is $R_2$ for both absorption and emission.\n\nThe excited states are also subject to spontaneous decay. Level $|2\\rangle$ decays to level $|1\\rangle$ with a rate $\\Gamma_{21}$. Level $|3\\rangle$ can decay to level $|2\\rangle$ with a rate $\\Gamma_{32}$ or directly to level $|1\\rangle$ with a rate $\\Gamma_{31}$. There are no other decay channels.\n\nThe system is closed, meaning the total population is conserved.
