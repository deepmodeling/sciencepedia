The lattice is engineered to have a dimerized structure, meaning the unit cell consists of two distinct sites, labeled A and B. The on-site energy for an atom at an A-site is $E_A$, and at a B-site is $E_B$. The tunneling (or hopping) amplitude for an atom moving between an A-site and its adjacent B-site within the same unit cell is $J_1$. The tunneling amplitude between a B-site in one unit cell and the A-site in the next unit cell is $J_2$. Both $J_1$ and $J_2$ are real and positive constants. The distance between corresponding sites in adjacent unit cells is denoted by $a$.\n\nThis system can be described by the tight-binding Hamiltonian:\n$$\nH = \\sum_{n} \\left( E_A c_{n,A}^\\dagger c_{n,A} + E_B c_{n,B}^\\dagger c_{n,B} \\right) - \\sum_{n} J_1 \\left( c_{n,A}^\\dagger c_{n,B} + c_{n,B}^\\dagger c_{n,A} \\right) - \\sum_{n} J_2 \\left( c_{n,B}^\\dagger c_{n+1,A} + c_{n+1,A}^\\dagger c_{n,B} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $c_{n,\\alpha}^\\dagger$ ($c_{n,\\alpha}$) is the creation (annihilation) operator for an atom at site $\\alpha \\in \\{A, B\\}$ in the $n$-th unit cell.\n\nAssuming a large number of unit cells and periodic boundary conditions, this system exhibits a band structure with two energy bands.

Express your answer in terms of the parameters $E_A, E_B, J_1$, and $J_2$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the direct band gap of a 1D dimerized lattice with alternating on-site energies and tunneling rates. The Hamiltonian is periodic with the unit cell length $a$. We can simplify the problem by transforming the Hamiltonian into momentum (quasimomentum) space.\n\n1.  **Fourier Transform**\n\nWe define the Fourier transform of the creation and annihilation operators for a system with $N$ unit cells:\n$$\nc_{n,\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{k} e^{-ikna} c_{k,\\alpha} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c_{n,\\alpha}^\\dagger = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{k} e^{ikna} c_{k,\\alpha}^\\dagger\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the quasimomentum, which belongs to the first Brillouin zone, $k \\in [-\\pi/a, \\pi/a]$.\n\n2.  **Hamiltonian in k-space**\n\nWe substitute these transformations into each term of the Hamiltonian $H$. The Hamiltonian decouples into a sum over $k$: $H = \\sum_k H_k$, where $H_k$ can be written in a matrix form using the basis of states in the unit cell, $\\{|k,A\\rangle, |k,B\\rangle\\}$. After performing the Fourier transform, the terms are collected as coefficients of $c_{k,\\alpha}^\\dagger c_{k,\\beta}$.\n\nThe on-site terms contribute to the diagonal elements. The intra-cell hopping $J_1$ and inter-cell hopping $J_2$ contribute to the off-diagonal elements. The inter-cell term $c_{n,B}^\\dagger c_{n+1,A}$ introduces a phase factor $e^{ika}$. The resulting k-space Hamiltonian for a given $k$ is:\n$$\nH_k = (c_{k,A}^\\dagger, c_{k,B}^\\dagger) \\mathcal{H}_k \\begin{pmatrix} c_{k,A} \\\\ c_{k,B} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere the matrix $\\mathcal{H}_k$ is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}_k = \\begin{pmatrix} E_A & -J_1 - J_2 e^{ika} \\\\ -J_1 - J_2 e^{-ika} & E_B \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n3.  **Diagonalization and Eigenvalues**\n\nTo find the energy bands $E(k)$, we need to find the eigenvalues of the $2 \\times 2$ matrix $\\mathcal{H}_k$ for each $k$.
