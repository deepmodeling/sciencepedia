## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the theoretical foundations of [prethermalization](@entry_id:147591) and the Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), elucidating the mechanisms by which isolated integrable quantum systems relax to non-thermal steady states. Having developed this core framework, we now turn our attention to its applications and interdisciplinary relevance. This chapter aims to demonstrate the profound utility of these concepts in explaining observable phenomena in diverse experimental settings, from [ultracold atomic gases](@entry_id:143830) to condensed matter systems. Furthermore, we will explore how the principles of the GGE connect to, and provide a foundation for, some of the most active frontiers in many-body physics, including [generalized hydrodynamics](@entry_id:138455), [quantum transport](@entry_id:138932), entanglement dynamics, and the subtle boundary between [integrability](@entry_id:142415) and quantum chaos. Our goal is not to reiterate the principles but to showcase their power in action, revealing how they provide a quantitative and predictive lens through which to view the complex dynamics of [quantum matter](@entry_id:162104) far from equilibrium.

### Prototypical Quenches and Relaxation Dynamics

The quantum quench—the sudden change of a parameter in a system's Hamiltonian—is the archetypal protocol for studying [non-equilibrium dynamics](@entry_id:160262) and serves as a primary context for the application of the GGE. Experiments with ultracold atoms, where system parameters such as trapping potentials and interaction strengths can be tuned with high precision, provide an ideal platform for realizing and observing the consequences of such quenches.

A canonical example is the "partitioning protocol," where two initially independent systems, prepared in different equilibrium states, are suddenly joined. Consider two one-dimensional, non-interacting Fermi gases at zero temperature, characterized by different chemical potentials and thus different Fermi momenta, $k_{F,L}$ and $k_{F,R}$. At time $t=0$, the barrier separating them is removed. The system evolves unitarily, and since it is integrable (being non-interacting), it does not thermalize in the conventional sense. Instead, it relaxes to a GGE. The [occupation numbers](@entry_id:155861) $n_k$ of the single-particle momentum modes are the conserved quantities that define this GGE. Since the initial state is a simple product state in real space, the final occupation numbers in the combined system are an average of the initial distributions. Specifically, a mode with momentum $k$ will be occupied with a probability that is the average of its occupation in the initial left and right subsystems. This leads to a step-like, non-thermal distribution in momentum space. A key prediction is that local observables will relax to stationary values determined by this GGE. For instance, the kinetic energy contained in the original left half of the system will, after a long time, equilibrate to a value that depends on the sum of the cubes of both initial Fermi momenta, $k_{F,L}^3 + k_{F,R}^3$, reflecting the mixture of particles from both initial reservoirs. This outcome is fundamentally different from a thermal prediction and provides a direct signature of generalized [thermalization](@entry_id:142388). [@problem_id:1261884]

Another experimentally prevalent quench protocol involves releasing a cloud of atoms from a confining potential. For a one-dimensional gas of non-interacting fermions initially in the ground state of a harmonic trap, suddenly switching off the trap initiates a [free expansion](@entry_id:139216). The GGE formalism makes a powerful prediction: since the momentum-mode [occupation numbers](@entry_id:155861) $n_k$ are [integrals of motion](@entry_id:163455) for the free-particle Hamiltonian, the momentum distribution of the gas remains unchanged for all time. Consequently, the long-time momentum distribution is identical to that of the initial trapped state. Physical properties of the expanding cloud are thus inherited from the initial state. For example, the variance of the momentum distribution, $\langle k^2 \rangle$, in the final steady state is determined entirely by the [average kinetic energy](@entry_id:146353) of the particles in the initial harmonic ground state. This can be calculated using the [virial theorem](@entry_id:146441) for the harmonic oscillator and is directly proportional to the particle number $N$ and trap frequency $\omega$. [@problem_id:1261780] This principle extends to strongly interacting systems that are integrable. A one-dimensional Bose gas in the Tonks-Girardeau (TG) limit, where repulsive interactions are infinitely strong, can be mapped to a system of non-interacting fermions. When a TG gas is released from a harmonic trap, its subsequent evolution is also governed by a GGE. The total momentum squared, $P^2$, is a conserved quantity of the free-gas Hamiltonian, and its expectation value in the final GGE state is therefore identical to its value in the initial trapped ground state. This value can be calculated by considering the [motion of the center of mass](@entry_id:168102), which behaves as a single particle in the harmonic potential, providing another sharp, verifiable prediction of GGE. [@problem_id:1261837]

### Quantum Transport and Non-Equilibrium Steady States

The persistence of memory in [integrable systems](@entry_id:144213), encapsulated by the GGE, has profound consequences for transport properties. Unlike generic, [chaotic systems](@entry_id:139317) where currents decay and transport is diffusive, [integrable systems](@entry_id:144213) can support non-dissipative, [ballistic transport](@entry_id:141251). This is characterized by a non-zero Drude weight, which measures the persistent, non-decaying part of a current in response to a perturbation.

The GGE framework provides a direct route to calculating [transport coefficients](@entry_id:136790) like the Drude weight. For [integrable models](@entry_id:152837), a powerful result known as the Mazur-Suzuki bound, which provides a lower bound on the Drude weight, becomes an exact equality. The formula expresses the Drude weight in terms of the overlaps between the current operator and the complete set of [conserved charges](@entry_id:145660) that define the GGE. In the anisotropic Heisenberg (XXZ) [spin chain](@entry_id:139648), a paradigm of [integrability](@entry_id:142415), this formalism can be applied to compute quantities like the energy current Drude weight, $D_E$. In the simplified case of the XX chain (anisotropy $\Delta=0$), which maps to [free fermions](@entry_id:140103), the [conserved charges](@entry_id:145660) have a simple form. Calculating $D_E$ in the infinite-temperature GGE state reveals that it is non-zero, directly confirming the capacity for ballistic energy transport. This result starkly contrasts with non-[integrable systems](@entry_id:144213), where such Drude weights typically vanish. [@problem_id:1261776]

Beyond [homogeneous systems](@entry_id:171824), GGE concepts are crucial for understanding [non-equilibrium steady states](@entry_id:275745) (NESS) that form at the interface of different systems. Consider a quantum junction formed by connecting two different Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs), characterized by different Luttinger parameters $K_L$ and $K_R$. Applying a chemical potential difference $\Delta\mu$ across this junction drives a particle current $J$. The resulting NESS is described by GGEs in the two leads. The particle conductance $G_p = J/\Delta\mu$ depends critically on the properties of both TLLs. From this, one can calculate the rate of [energy dissipation](@entry_id:147406), or power $P = J \Delta\mu$, at the junction. This power is proportional to $(\Delta\mu)^2$ and a factor depending on $K_L$ and $K_R$, illustrating how the microscopic parameters of the integrable leads dictate macroscopic transport and dissipation phenomena at the interface. [@problem_id:1261825]

### Generalized Hydrodynamics: The Emergent Spacetime Dynamics

While the GGE describes the stationary state of a [homogeneous system](@entry_id:150411), many physical situations involve states that are inhomogeneous in space and time. Generalized Hydrodynamics (GHD) is a powerful theoretical framework that extends the GGE concept to describe the large-scale, long-time (Euler-scale) dynamics of [integrable systems](@entry_id:144213). GHD posits that the system can be viewed as a fluid of quasiparticles, where the local state at each spacetime point $(x,t)$ is described by a local GGE. The evolution of this local GGE is governed by a hydrodynamic continuity equation.

A key prediction of GHD is the emergence of [self-similar](@entry_id:274241) dynamics in quench protocols starting from piecewise homogeneous states, where all local properties depend only on the ray $\zeta = x/t$. For a domain-wall quench, where a system at a finite density is joined to a vacuum, GHD provides a simple "light-cone" rule for the quasiparticle distribution. For the Tonks-Girardeau gas, where quasiparticles are [free fermions](@entry_id:140103), the state at a given ray $\zeta$ is formed by quasiparticles from the left reservoir if their effective velocity is greater than $\zeta$, and from the right reservoir otherwise. This allows for the calculation of the full spatio-temporal profiles of observables. For instance, one can compute the particle current $j(\zeta)$ and find its value at the initial interface ($\zeta=0$), which depends quadratically on the initial densities of the reservoirs. [@problem_id:1261828]

The true power of GHD is revealed in genuinely interacting systems, where quasiparticles are "dressed" by their interactions with other quasiparticles. In the interacting Yang-Gaudin model of two-component fermions, the energy, momentum, and velocity of a quasiparticle are modified by the density of other quasiparticles, a non-trivial effect captured by [integral equations](@entry_id:138643). GHD allows for the calculation of these dressed quantities and, subsequently, the currents in any given GGE state. This has been used, for example, to compute the total energy current in a spin-symmetric GGE, yielding complex expressions that account for the non-linear effects of interactions on transport. [@problem_id:1261818]

### Interdisciplinary Connections and Research Frontiers

The ideas of generalized [thermalization](@entry_id:142388) and GGE extend far beyond their initial domain, connecting to quantum information theory, the study of driven systems, and the fundamental question of how quantum systems approach equilibrium.

#### Quantum Information and Complexity

The GGE framework provides insights into purely quantum mechanical properties, such as entanglement. Following a quench, the entanglement entropy between two halves of an [integrable system](@entry_id:151808) typically grows linearly in time before saturating. GHD can predict this growth rate. For a domain-wall quench in a 1D Bose gas, the entanglement production rate is given by the entropy current of the NESS formed at the interface. This provides a remarkable link between a thermodynamic quantity (entropy current) and a quantum information metric (entanglement growth), and its calculation for a thermal-to-vacuum quench yields a rate directly proportional to the initial temperature. [@problem_id:1261756]

More recently, connections have been forged with the concept of Krylov complexity, a measure of operator growth in the Heisenberg picture. It has been conjectured that the long-time saturation value of Krylov complexity for local operators in an [integrable system](@entry_id:151808) is directly related to the [thermodynamic entropy](@entry_id:155885) of the corresponding GGE. For a GGE of non-interacting fermions where the stationary mode occupation is a constant $n_0$, the entropy density is given by the classic formula for a [two-level system](@entry_id:138452), $s = -n_0\ln(n_0) - (1-n_0)\ln(1-n_0)$. This suggests that complexity, a measure of dynamical chaos, can directly probe the thermodynamic properties of the non-thermal steady state. [@problem_id:1261851]

#### Beyond Strict Integrability

Perhaps one of the most important roles of GGE is as a baseline for understanding systems that are not strictly integrable.

**Prethermalization:** Generic, non-[integrable systems](@entry_id:144213) are expected to thermalize. However, if such a system is "close" to an integrable point—for instance, a periodically driven (Floquet) system at high frequency $\Omega$—it can exhibit a long-lived intermediate state known as a prethermal plateau. During this phase, the system behaves as if it were relaxing to a GGE associated with an effective, time-independent, and quasi-local Hamiltonian $H_{\text{eff}}$. This state persists for a time that can be exponentially long in the drive frequency, $t_* \sim \exp(c\Omega/J)$, where $J$ is the local energy scale. Only at much later times do rare, high-order processes lead to energy absorption from the drive, causing the system to eventually heat up to the true infinite-temperature steady state predicted by the Floquet-Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis. [@problem_id:2984449] The observability of this prethermal regime depends critically on the interplay between drive frequency, [interaction strength](@entry_id:192243), and spatial dimension. Higher dimensionality, for instance, typically increases the number of available resonant heating channels, reducing the prethermal lifetime. The onset of heating can be experimentally diagnosed by monitoring the stroboscopic energy absorption rate, which remains nearly zero during the prethermal plateau before increasing sharply. [@problem_id:2990452]

**Weak Integrability Breaking:** When [integrability](@entry_id:142415) is broken by a weak perturbation, the GGE is no longer the ultimate fate. However, it can govern the dynamics for intermediate times. On much longer timescales, the system will eventually thermalize. A practical example is a nearly [integrable system](@entry_id:151808) subjected to a slow, weak, spatially-inhomogeneous periodic drive. The drive acts as a source of energy, and the weak [integrability](@entry_id:142415) breaking leads to [diffusive transport](@entry_id:150792). A non-equilibrium steady state can be established where the local power absorbed from the drive is balanced by diffusive heat currents, obeying Fourier's law. By modeling the [absorbed power](@entry_id:265908) and the heat current, one can derive the [steady-state temperature](@entry_id:136775) profile across the system, bridging the gap between the [ballistic transport](@entry_id:141251) of [integrable systems](@entry_id:144213) and the [diffusive transport](@entry_id:150792) of chaotic ones. [@problem_id:1261826]

**Quantum Many-Body Scars:** A fascinating exception to the standard dichotomy of integrable (GGE) versus chaotic (thermal) systems is the phenomenon of [quantum many-body scars](@entry_id:142377). Certain non-[integrable models](@entry_id:152837), such as the PXP model relevant to Rydberg atom arrays, possess a small subset of anomalous, non-thermal [eigenstates](@entry_id:149904) embedded within an otherwise thermal spectrum. If a system is prepared in an initial state that has a significant overlap with these "scar" states, its dynamics will exhibit persistent oscillations and surprisingly long-lived memory of its initial configuration, defying conventional thermalization. The long-[time average](@entry_id:151381) of a local observable will not relax to the GGE (or thermal) prediction but will show a persistent deviation. This deviation is proportional to the overlap of the initial state with the scar subspace and the difference between the observable's [expectation value](@entry_id:150961) in the initial state and its thermal average. This provides a concrete mechanism for weak [ergodicity breaking](@entry_id:147086) that is distinct from [integrability](@entry_id:142415). [@problem_id:1261763]

#### Correlation Functions in the GGE

Finally, the GGE has direct, measurable consequences on the spatial correlations in the steady state. In a Luttinger liquid, for example, an interaction quench modifies the long-distance algebraic decay of [correlation functions](@entry_id:146839). The system relaxes to a GGE where the decay exponent is no longer determined by the final Hamiltonian's Luttinger parameter $K$ alone. Instead, it is governed by an effective parameter, $K_{\text{eff}}$, which is a specific combination of the initial ($K_0$) and final ($K$) parameters. For instance, after a quench, the effective parameter is given by $K_{\text{eff}} = (K^2 + K_0^2) / (2K_0)$. This modification is a direct consequence of the non-thermal distribution of excitations in the GGE and can be probed using standard experimental techniques like Bragg spectroscopy.
