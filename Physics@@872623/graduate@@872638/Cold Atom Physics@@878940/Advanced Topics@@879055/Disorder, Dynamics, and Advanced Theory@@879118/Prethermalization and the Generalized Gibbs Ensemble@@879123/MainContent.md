## Introduction
How do isolated [quantum many-body systems](@entry_id:141221) reach equilibrium? While generic systems are expected to thermalize, forgetting their initial conditions except for their total energy, a vast and physically relevant class of systems—[integrable models](@entry_id:152837)—stubbornly defies this picture. Their unique structure of [conserved quantities](@entry_id:148503) prevents them from reaching a standard thermal state, posing a fundamental challenge to statistical mechanics and opening the door to novel forms of non-equilibrium matter. This article addresses this knowledge gap by exploring the frameworks of the Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE) and [prethermalization](@entry_id:147591).

This article will guide you through the modern understanding of relaxation in such systems. First, the "Principles and Mechanisms" chapter will detail why thermalization fails in [integrable systems](@entry_id:144213) and how the GGE is constructed to accurately describe their non-thermal steady states. Next, the "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" chapter will demonstrate the power of this framework by connecting it to experimental observations in [ultracold atoms](@entry_id:137057), [quantum transport](@entry_id:138932), and the emergent spacetime dynamics described by Generalized Hydrodynamics. Finally, the "Hands-On Practices" section will offer concrete problems to solidify your grasp of these concepts, enabling you to apply the principles of the GGE to physical scenarios.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The dynamics of isolated [quantum many-body systems](@entry_id:141221) pose fundamental questions at the intersection of quantum mechanics and statistical physics. A central question is how, and if, such systems reach a state of equilibrium through their own [unitary evolution](@entry_id:145020). For generic, or "chaotic," systems, the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) provides a powerful framework, suggesting that they relax to a standard thermal equilibrium described by the Gibbs ensemble. However, a large and physically important class of systems—[integrable models](@entry_id:152837)—defy this description. Their unique properties lead to a novel form of relaxation, not to thermal equilibrium, but to a non-thermal steady state described by the Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE). This chapter elucidates the core principles governing this phenomenon.

### The Failure of Thermalization: The Role of Conserved Quantities

An isolated quantum system evolves unitarily from an initial state $|\Psi_0\rangle$ according to the Schrödinger equation, $|\Psi(t)\rangle = \exp(-iHt/\hbar) |\Psi_0\rangle$. The [expectation value](@entry_id:150961) of an observable $\hat{O}$ at time $t$ is $\langle \hat{O} \rangle_t = \langle \Psi(t) | \hat{O} | \Psi(t) \rangle$. For the system to thermalize, the long-time average of $\langle \hat{O} \rangle_t$ must match the prediction of a thermal ensemble, typically the microcanonical or canonical Gibbs ensemble. The canonical Gibbs ensemble, for instance, is given by the density matrix $\hat{\rho}_{\text{th}} = Z^{-1} \exp(-\beta H)$, where $\beta$ is an inverse temperature determined by the initial energy density.

This [thermalization](@entry_id:142388) paradigm relies on the assumption that, apart from the total energy, no other "simple" [conserved quantities](@entry_id:148503) exist to constrain the system's dynamics. The system is free to explore the entire energy shell in Hilbert space, leading to an effective averaging that washes out all initial state information except for the energy.

**Integrable models** are systems that violate this assumption in a profound way. They possess an extensive number of local or quasi-local conserved quantities, $\{\hat{I}_k\}$, which commute with the Hamiltonian and with each other:
$$ [H, \hat{I}_k] = 0, \quad [\hat{I}_k, \hat{I}_j] = 0 \quad \forall k, j $$
The existence of these additional conservation laws severely restricts the system's dynamics. The state cannot explore the entire energy shell, but is confined to the subspace where the [expectation values](@entry_id:153208) of all $\hat{I}_k$ are constant. Consequently, the memory of the initial state is retained not just in the energy, but in the full set of these [conserved charges](@entry_id:145660). The system fails to thermalize and instead relaxes to a non-thermal steady state that must account for all these constraints.

### The Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE)

The appropriate [statistical ensemble](@entry_id:145292) to describe the steady state of an [integrable system](@entry_id:151808) is the **Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE)**. The GGE is a natural generalization of the canonical ensemble that maximizes the [statistical entropy](@entry_id:150092) subject to the constraints imposed by all [conserved quantities](@entry_id:148503). The GGE [density matrix](@entry_id:139892) takes the form:
$$ \hat{\rho}_{\text{GGE}} = \frac{1}{Z_{\text{GGE}}} \exp\left(-\sum_k \lambda_k \hat{I}_k\right) $$
Here, $Z_{\text{GGE}} = \text{Tr}\left[\exp\left(-\sum_k \lambda_k \hat{I}_k\right)\right]$ is the generalized partition function. Each conserved charge $\hat{I}_k$ is associated with a corresponding **Lagrange multiplier** $\lambda_k$. These multipliers are not arbitrary; they are determined by the initial state of the system. Specifically, they are fixed by the condition that the expectation value of each conserved quantity in the GGE must be equal to its expectation value in the initial state $|\Psi_0\rangle$:
$$ \text{Tr}(\hat{\rho}_{\text{GGE}} \hat{I}_k) = \langle \Psi_0 | \hat{I}_k | \Psi_0 \rangle \quad \text{for all } k $$
This set of equations ensures that the GGE correctly captures all the conserved information from the initial state and thus accurately predicts the long-time expectation values of local observables.

A paradigmatic example is a system that can be mapped to non-interacting fermions, such as a one-dimensional gas of hardcore bosons. For such systems, the final Hamiltonian after a quench is often diagonal in [momentum space](@entry_id:148936), $H_f = \sum_k \epsilon_k \hat{n}_k$, where $\hat{n}_k = c_k^\dagger c_k$ is the occupation [number operator](@entry_id:153568) for momentum mode $k$. Since modes with different momenta evolve independently, the operators $\hat{n}_k$ form a complete set of [conserved charges](@entry_id:145660).

Let us consider a concrete scenario to illustrate the GGE construction [@problem_id:1261784]. Imagine a 1D hardcore Bose gas (equivalent to spinless fermions) at half-filling, initially in the ground state of a Hamiltonian $H_0$ with nearest-neighbor hopping $J$ and a staggered potential $V_0$. At time $t=0$, the staggered potential is suddenly switched off, and the system evolves under the free fermion Hamiltonian $H_f = -J \sum_j (c_j^\dagger c_{j+1} + \text{h.c.})$, which has [conserved charges](@entry_id:145660) $\hat{n}_k$. To find the GGE that describes the subsequent steady state, we must determine the Lagrange multipliers $\lambda_k$. The GGE prediction for the occupation of a fermionic mode $k$ is $\langle \hat{n}_k \rangle_{\text{GGE}} = (e^{\lambda_k} + 1)^{-1}$. This must be equal to the occupation in the initial ground state, $\langle \Psi_0 | \hat{n}_k | \Psi_0 \rangle$. A detailed calculation shows that the initial ground state, which is a filled band of quasiparticles of $H_0$, leads to an initial occupation for the modes of $H_f$ given by:
$$ \langle \Psi_0 | \hat{n}_k | \Psi_0 \rangle = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 + \frac{2J\cos k}{\sqrt{(2J\cos k)^2 + V_0^2}}\right) $$
By equating this with the GGE [expectation value](@entry_id:150961), we can solve for each $\lambda_k$. For the zero-momentum mode ($k=0$), this yields:
$$ \frac{1}{e^{\lambda_0} + 1} = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 + \frac{2J}{\sqrt{4J^2 + V_0^2}}\right) $$
Solving for $\lambda_0$ gives:
$$ \lambda_0 = \ln\left(\frac{1 - \langle \hat{n}_0 \rangle_0}{\langle \hat{n}_0 \rangle_0}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{\sqrt{4J^2+V_0^2} - 2J}{\sqrt{4J^2+V_0^2} + 2J}\right) $$
This calculation demonstrates the core principle of the GGE: the properties of the final steady state (encoded in the $\lambda_k$) are directly and deterministically inherited from the specific structure of the initial state.

### GGE in Interacting Models and the Role of Quasiparticles

For genuinely interacting [integrable models](@entry_id:152837), such as the Lieb-Liniger gas or the Heisenberg [spin chain](@entry_id:139648), the [conserved charges](@entry_id:145660) $\hat{I}_k$ are more complex than simple mode occupations. Their construction is a central result of the Bethe ansatz solution method. However, the physical picture remains analogous: the system's [eigenstates](@entry_id:149904) can be described by a set of stable **quasiparticles**, each characterized by a [quantum number](@entry_id:148529) called **[rapidity](@entry_id:265131)**, $\lambda$. The rapidities are essentially the momenta of these quasiparticles, corrected by interaction effects. The set of rapidities $\{\lambda_j\}$ for an [eigenstate](@entry_id:202009) is conserved during time evolution.

A crucial insight for quantum quenches in many [integrable models](@entry_id:152837) is the principle of **rapidity distribution conservation**. If an initial state can be characterized by a certain distribution of rapidities, this distribution remains unchanged by the quench, even if the [interaction strength](@entry_id:192243) is suddenly altered. The final GGE is then the one corresponding to this "frozen" rapidity distribution.

Consider a quench in the Lieb-Liniger model from the infinitely repulsive Tonks-Girardeau limit ($g \to \infty$) to a non-interacting Bose gas ($g=0$) [@problem_id:1261864]. In the Tonks-Girardeau limit, the system maps to [free fermions](@entry_id:140103), and the initial state, a current-carrying configuration, corresponds to a filled "Fermi sea" of rapidities in an interval $[k_0 - k_F, k_0 + k_F]$. When the interactions are quenched to zero, the rapidities become the actual particle momenta. Therefore, the final [momentum distribution](@entry_id:162113) of the non-interacting bosons is precisely the uniform distribution of the initial rapidities. The final state is a GGE characterized by this momentum distribution. We can then calculate the expectation value of any conserved quantity of the final Hamiltonian. For example, the third-order charge $\hat{I}_3 = \sum_j \hat{p}_j^3$ has an [expectation value](@entry_id:150961) found by integrating $p^3$ over this distribution. For a gas of density $n_0$ with an initial momentum shift $p_0$, this value is found to be $\langle \hat{I}_3 \rangle = N p_0 (p_0^2 + \pi^2 n_0^2 \hbar^2)$. This confirms that the GGE correctly captures the expectation values of all, including higher-order, [conserved charges](@entry_id:145660).

In more complex models like the Heisenberg [spin chain](@entry_id:139648), quasiparticles can form [bound states](@entry_id:136502), known as **strings** in the Bethe [ansatz](@entry_id:184384) formalism. A quantum quench can populate these different types of excitations. For example, quenching a classical Néel state in the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain results in a GGE that is described not by single [magnons](@entry_id:139809), but predominantly by bound pairs of magnons (2-strings) [@problem_id:1261778]. The properties of this GGE are fully determined by the density of these 2-strings as a function of their [rapidity](@entry_id:265131), $\rho_{2s}(\lambda)$. Knowing this function allows for the calculation of any local observable in the steady state, such as the [staggered magnetization](@entry_id:194295). The probability of forming such bound states depends on the overlap of the initial state with the corresponding eigenstates, a concept beautifully illustrated in the XXZ model, where the probability for two adjacent [magnons](@entry_id:139809) to form a 2-string after a quench depends only on the anisotropy parameter $\Delta$ [@problem_id:1261782].

The state of a GGE is thus described by the [rapidity](@entry_id:265131) distribution of its constituent particles, $\rho(\lambda)$, and holes, $\rho_h(\lambda)$. These are related via a set of coupled integral equations derived from the Bethe ansatz. For the Lieb-Liniger gas, for instance, the total density of available states, $\rho_t(\lambda)$, is related to the particle density $\rho(\lambda)$ via an [integral equation](@entry_id:165305) involving an interaction kernel [@problem_id:1261857]. The hole density is simply $\rho_h(\lambda) = \rho_t(\lambda) - \rho(\lambda)$. The ratio of hole to particle densities is a key characteristic of the GGE state.

### Microscopic Foundations and Thermodynamic Properties

While the GGE provides a successful macroscopic description, its validity rests on a deeper microscopic principle: the **Generalized Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (GETH)**. GETH is the extension of the ETH to [integrable systems](@entry_id:144213). It posits that the diagonal matrix elements of a local observable $\hat{O}$ in the system's [energy eigenstates](@entry_id:152154), $\langle \alpha | \hat{O} | \alpha \rangle$, are not constant on an energy shell, but are instead a smooth function of the eigenvalues of *all* [conserved charges](@entry_id:145660) corresponding to that eigenstate $|\alpha\rangle$.

This implies that for any two eigenstates that have nearly the same set of conserved charge eigenvalues, the expectation values of local observables will be nearly identical. As a consequence, fluctuations of these [matrix elements](@entry_id:186505) within a "GGE microcanonical shell" (a set of eigenstates with a fixed density of all [conserved charges](@entry_id:145660)) are strongly suppressed and vanish in the thermodynamic limit. A test of this hypothesis involves calculating the variance of the [diagonal matrix](@entry_id:637782) elements of an observable across the eigenstates corresponding to a GGE. For the XX [spin chain](@entry_id:139648), which maps to [free fermions](@entry_id:140103), the variance of the two-site correlation operator $\sigma_0^z \sigma_1^z$ can be explicitly calculated and is found to scale as $1/L$, where $L$ is the system size [@problem_id:1261863]. This $1/L$ suppression confirms the prediction of GETH and provides the microscopic justification for why the GGE correctly describes the steady state.

The GGE, being a [statistical ensemble](@entry_id:145292), also allows for the definition of thermodynamic quantities. The **GGE entropy**, for example, can be calculated using standard formulas from statistical mechanics, but applied to the quasiparticle distribution of the GGE. For a system of bosonic quasiparticles with a distribution $N(k)$, the entropy density $s=S/L$ is given by:
$$ s = k_B \int \frac{dk}{2\pi} \left[ (1+N(k))\ln(1+N(k)) - N(k)\ln N(k) \right] $$
For a GGE whose quasiparticle distribution happens to have a Bose-Einstein form, $N(k) = (e^{\beta \hbar v |k|} - 1)^{-1}$, the entropy density can be calculated to be $s = \frac{\pi k_B}{3\beta\hbar v}$ [@problem_id:1261789]. This entropy quantifies the [information content](@entry_id:272315) of the steady state, given the constraints of all conserved quantities.

### Prethermalization and the Limits of the GGE Framework

So far, we have considered perfectly [integrable systems](@entry_id:144213). In reality, most physical systems are not perfectly integrable but may be close to an integrable point. Such systems are described by a Hamiltonian of the form $H = H_{int} + \epsilon V$, where $H_{int}$ is integrable and $\epsilon V$ is a small, integrability-breaking perturbation.

These systems exhibit a remarkable two-stage relaxation process known as **[prethermalization](@entry_id:147591)**.
1.  **Fast Relaxation (Prethermalization):** On a short timescale, typically of order $1/J$ (where $J$ is the energy scale of $H_{int}$), the system rapidly forgets most details of its initial state, but remains constrained by the quantities that are conserved by $H_{int}$. It relaxes to a quasi-stationary state described by a GGE constructed from the [conserved charges](@entry_id:145660) of the integrable part, $H_{int}$.
2.  **Slow Relaxation (Thermalization):** On a much longer timescale, parametrically large in the perturbation strength (e.g., $1/\epsilon^2$), the [integrability](@entry_id:142415)-breaking term $V$ induces slow "drift" among the GGEs. The system eventually explores the full energy shell and relaxes to a true thermal equilibrium described by the Gibbs ensemble of the full Hamiltonian $H$.

During the prethermal plateau, local observables appear to be stationary and are well-described by the GGE of $H_{int}$. This description can have powerful predictive consequences based on symmetry. For example, if the integrable Hamiltonian $H_{XXZ}$ and all its local [conserved charges](@entry_id:145660) are even under a symmetry operation like parity, while the perturbation $V_{DM}$ is odd, the resulting prethermal GGE density matrix must also be parity-even. Consequently, the expectation value of the perturbation in this prethermal state must vanish: $\langle V_{DM} \rangle_{pre} = \text{Tr}(\rho_{GGE} V_{DM}) = 0$ [@problem_id:1261809]. This implies that, at leading order, the perturbation does not cause [energy drift](@entry_id:748982), leading to an even longer lifetime for the prethermal state.

The very existence of a prethermal description relies on the stability of the [conserved charges](@entry_id:145660) of $H_{int}$ under the perturbation $V$. The perturbed system is expected to possess a set of **quasi-local [conserved charges](@entry_id:145660) (QLCs)**, which are "dressed" versions of the original charges. However, this structure can break down. For systems with long-range interactions, for instance, this quasi-locality may be lost. If a perturbation contains interactions that decay with distance $r$ as $1/r^\alpha$, the dressing of the local charges involves operators with increasingly large spatial support. If the interaction decay is too slow (i.e., $\alpha$ is too small), the resulting QLCs become non-local, and the prethermal description breaks down. A careful analysis reveals a [critical exponent](@entry_id:748054) $\alpha_c=2$; for $\alpha \le 2$, the perturbative construction of QLCs diverges, signaling an instability of the prethermal phase [@problem_id:1261814].

### Advanced Frontiers: Quench Action and Hilbert Space Fragmentation

The determination of the GGE state, i.e., finding the correct [rapidity](@entry_id:265131) distribution $\rho(\lambda)$, is a non-trivial task. The **Quench Action (QA) formalism** provides a powerful [variational method](@entry_id:140454) for this purpose [@problem_id:1261801]. It is based on finding the specific distribution of rapidities that dominates the overlap with the initial state. The saddle-point of this "action" functional yields a Fredholm integral equation for a function $f(\lambda)$ related to the ratio of hole-to-particle densities. Solving this equation, often via Fourier transform, allows for a direct determination of the GGE state from first principles.

Finally, recent research has uncovered even stronger forms of [ergodicity breaking](@entry_id:147086) that go beyond standard [integrability](@entry_id:142415). Certain systems with kinetic constraints exhibit **Hilbert space fragmentation**, where the Hilbert space shatters into an exponential number of dynamically disconnected sectors. Evolution starting from an initial state is forever confined to the fragment it belongs to. Thermalization can only occur, if at all, within such a fragment. This leads to a rich dynamical behavior where the long-time state depends sensitively on the initial configuration. The long-time average of a local observable is given by a diagonal ensemble restricted to the specific fragment. For example, in a constrained [spin chain](@entry_id:139648), immobile spins can act as barriers, creating isolated sub-chains where mobile excitations evolve independently. The long-time average density of an excitation at a particular site can be calculated by considering only the eigenstates of the effective Hamiltonian governing that specific, isolated fragment [@problem_id:1261878]. This phenomenon represents a new frontier in the study of non-ergodic dynamics, where GGE-like principles apply in a highly structured and fragmented Hilbert space.
