For integrable systems, like the Toda lattice, thermalization to a standard Gibbs ensemble is not guaranteed. Instead, they often relax to a non-equilibrium steady state described by a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), which accounts for all of the system's conserved quantities.\n\nConsider an infinite one-dimensional Toda lattice of particles, each with mass $m$. The interaction between adjacent particles is described by a potential $V(x)$, where $x$ is the difference in their positions. For times $t < 0$, the system is prepared in a specific, inhomogeneous state: the semi-infinite chain of particles with site indices $n < 0$ is in thermal equilibrium at a temperature $T$, while the other semi-infinite chain of particles with indices $n \\ge 0$ is in its ground state (i.e., at zero temperature, with all particles at rest at their equilibrium positions).
