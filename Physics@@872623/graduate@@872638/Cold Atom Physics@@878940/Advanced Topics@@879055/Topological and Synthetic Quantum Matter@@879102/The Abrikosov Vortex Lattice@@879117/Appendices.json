The ordered structure of an Abrikosov lattice arises from the mutual repulsion between vortices, a classic example of self-organization. This problem [@problem_id:1270731] provides a tractable model for this phenomenon by asking you to find the ground-state arrangement of just three interacting vortices within a square boundary. Solving this energy minimization problem reveals how fundamental repulsive forces and geometric constraints work together to establish a preferred spatial configuration, the first step towards forming an extended lattice.", "problem": "A simplified model for the interaction of $N$ identical Abrikosov vortices in a two-dimensional type-II superconductor treats them as point particles. The interaction energy between any two vortices, $i$ and $j$, is given by a repulsive logarithmic potential:\n$$U_{ij} = -U_0 \\ln\\left(\\frac{|\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j|}{L}\\right)$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{r}_i$ and $\\mathbf{r}_j$ are the position vectors of the vortices, $U_0$ is a positive energy constant, and $L$ is a characteristic length scale.\n\nConsider a system of three such vortices ($N=3$) confined within a rigid square box of side length $L$.

This means we need to maximize the product of the inter-vortex distances:\n$$P = d_{12} d_{13} d_{23}$$\nsubject to the constraint that all three vortices are within the square region defined by $x \\in [-L/2, L/2]$ and $y \\in [-L/2, L/2]$.\n\n2.  **Qualitative Argument for Boundary Placement**\n\nThe interaction is repulsive, meaning the vortices \"want\" to be as far apart as possible. For any configuration where a vortex is in the interior of the square, we can typically increase the distances (and thus the product $P$) by moving that vortex towards a boundary, away from the other vortices. This suggests that the energy minimum configuration will have all three vortices located on the boundary of the square. We will therefore test candidate configurations with vortices placed on the square's perimeter.\n\n3.  **Evaluating Candidate Configurations**\n\nDue to the symmetry of the square, we can anticipate that the ground-state configuration will also be symmetric. Let's analyze two plausible, high-symmetry configurations.\n\n**Candidate A: Isosceles Triangle with base on one side**\n\nLet's place two vortices on one side of the square and the third vortex on the opposing side, centered. To maximize their separation, the two vortices on the base should be at the corners, and the third vortex should be in the middle of the opposite side.\nLet the vertices of the square be at $(\\pm L/2, \\pm L/2)$.

By symmetry, any choice of three corners is equivalent.\nLet the positions be:\n$\\mathbf{r}_1 = (-L/2, -L/2)$\n$\\mathbf{r}_2 = (L/2, -L/2)$\n$\\mathbf{r}_3 = (L/2, L/2)$\n\nLet's calculate the distances for this configuration:\n$d_{12} = \\sqrt{(L/2 - (-L/2))^2 + (-L/2 - (-L/2))^2} = \\sqrt{L^2 + 0} = L$\n$d_{23} = \\sqrt{(L/2 - L/2)^2 + (L/2 - (-L/2))^2} = \\sqrt{0 + L^2} = L$\n$d_{13} = \\sqrt{(L/2 - (-L/2))^2 + (L/2 - (-L/2))^2} = \\sqrt{L^2 + L^2} = \\sqrt{2L^2} = L\\sqrt{2}$\n\nThe product of distances for this configuration is:\n$$P_B = d_{12} d_{13} d_{23} = L \\cdot (L\\sqrt{2}) \\cdot L = \\sqrt{2} L^3$$\n\n4.  **Comparing Candidates and Determining the Ground State**\n\nTo find the configuration with the minimum energy, we must find the configuration with the maximum product of distances, $P$.\nWe compare $P_A$ and $P_B$:\n$P_A = \\frac{5}{4}L^3 = 1.25 L^3$\n$P_B = \\sqrt{2} L^3 \\approx 1.414 L^3$\n\nSince $\\sqrt{2} > 5/4$, we have $P_B > P_A$. The \"Three Corners\" configuration (Candidate B) has a larger product of distances, and therefore a lower total energy. It is the ground state for this simplified model.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Ratio of Distances**\n\nFor the ground-state configuration (three vortices at three corners of the square), the inter-vortex distances are $L$, $L$, and $L\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe shortest distance is $d_{short} = L$.\nThe longest distance is $d_{long} = L\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe ratio of the longest to the shortest distance is:\n$$\\frac{d_{long}}{d_{short}} = \\frac{L\\sqrt{2}}{L} = \\sqrt{2}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{2}}$$", "id": "1270731"}, {"introduction": "The final step in our exploration is to analyze the properties of the extended vortex lattice itself.
