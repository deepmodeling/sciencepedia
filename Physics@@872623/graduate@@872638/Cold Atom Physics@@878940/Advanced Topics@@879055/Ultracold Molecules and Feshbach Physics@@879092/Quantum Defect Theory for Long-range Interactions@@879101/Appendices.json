The rate of such reactions, which occur at short internuclear distances, is highly sensitive to the amplitude of the scattering wavefunction in that region. This practice challenges you to use a core QDT concept—the modification of the short-range wavefunction by a long-range potential—to derive the threshold energy scaling for the recombination rate coefficient, revealing the predictive power of the theory for ultracold chemistry [@problem_id:1262745].", "problem": "Consider a system of two identical particles of reduced mass $\\mu$ interacting via a long-range potential $V(r) = -C_n/r^n$ for $r > r_0$, where $n$ is a real number greater than 2 and $C_n$ is a positive constant. At short internuclear distances $r  r_0$, an unspecified mechanism can cause the two particles to recombine into a deeply bound molecular state.

This implies that the corresponding rate coefficient $K_{2,sr} = (\\hbar k/\\mu) \\sigma_{in}$ approaches a constant value as $E \\to 0$.\n\nThe presence of the long-range potential $V(r)$ modifies this threshold behavior. The modification can be understood as an enhancement (or suppression) of the wavefunction amplitude at short distances, where the reaction occurs. This enhancement factor can be defined as the ratio of the probability density at short range for the interacting system to that of a free-particle system.\n\nAssume the following result from Quantum Defect Theory for a generic scattering scenario (i.e., away from any scattering resonance):\n1.
