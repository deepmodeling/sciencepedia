One of the most fundamental bifurcations is the saddle-node (or tangent) bifurcation. It corresponds to the creation or annihilation of a pair of fixed points. Geometrically, this occurs at a parameter value where the graph of $f(x)$ becomes tangent to the $x$-axis. This tangency condition implies that at the bifurcation point, not only is the function zero, but its derivative with respect to $x$ is also zero.

If $r$ is changed very slowly (adiabatically), the system's state $x$ is assumed to remain at a stable fixed point. When $r$ is slowly cycled from a sufficiently negative value to a sufficiently positive value and then back, the system can exhibit hysteresis. This means the path traced by the state variable $x(r)$ in the $(r,x)$ plane forms a closed loop as the system jumps between different stable branches at bifurcation points.\n\nFor the system described, a hysteresis loop is formed in the upper half-plane ($x > 0$) of the $(r,x)$ state-parameter space. Your task is to calculate the area of this specific loop.", "solution": "The area $A$ of a closed loop in the $(r,x)$ plane can be calculated by the line integral $A = \\oint x \\, dr$. To evaluate this, we must first determine the path of the hysteresis loop by analyzing the fixed points and their stability.\n\n**Step 1: Find the fixed points and their stability**\nThe fixed points $x^*$ satisfy $\\dot{x} = 0$:\n$$\nx(r + x^2 - x^4) = 0\n$$\nThis gives a fixed point at $x^* = 0$, and other fixed points determined by the roots of $r + x^2 - x^4 = 0$. We can rewrite this as $r = x^4 - x^2$. The curve of non-zero fixed points in the $(r,x)$ plane is given by this S-shaped curve.\n\nTo determine stability, we analyze the sign of the derivative $f'(x) = \\frac{d\\dot{x}}{dx}$ at the fixed points:\n$$\nf'(x) = r + 3x^2 - 5x^4\n$$\nFor the non-zero fixed points, we can substitute $r = x^4 - x^2$:\n$$\nf'(x^*) = ( (x^*)^4 - (x^*)^2 ) + 3(x^*)^2 - 5(x^*)^4 = 2(x^*)^2 - 4(x^*)^4 = 2(x^*)^2 (1 - 2(x^*)^2)\n$$\nSince $(x^*)^2 > 0$ for non-zero fixed points, stability ($f'(x^*)  0$) requires $1 - 2(x^*)^2  0$, which means $(x^*)^2 > 1/2$. The fixed points are unstable for $0  (x^*)^2  1/2$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the boundaries of the hysteresis loop**\nThe hysteresis loop is bounded by saddle-node bifurcations where stable and unstable branches merge. These \"turning points\" on the curve $r(x) = x^4 - x^2$ occur where $dr/dx = 0$.\n$$\n\\frac{dr}{dx} = 4x^3 - 2x = 2x(2x^2 - 1)\n$$\nSetting $dr/dx = 0$ gives $x=0$ and $x = \\pm 1/\\sqrt{2}$. The points at $x = \\pm 1/\\sqrt{2}$ correspond to the saddle-node bifurcations. Substituting this value back into the equation for $r$:\n$$\nr = (1/\\sqrt{2})^4 - (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/4 - 1/2 = -1/4\n$$\nSo, the saddle-node bifurcations that define the extent of the hysteresis loop occur at $(r,x) = (-1/4, \\pm 1/\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n**Step 3: Trace the hysteresis loop and set up the area integral**\nWe are interested in the loop in the upper half-plane ($x > 0$).\n1.  **Increasing r**: Starting with a large negative $r$, the only stable fixed point is $x^*=0$. The system stays at $x=0$ as $r$ increases. At $r=0$, the origin becomes unstable, and the system jumps to the upper stable branch at $x=1$.\n2.  **Decreasing r**: Now, as we decrease $r$ from a positive value, the system follows the upper stable branch (where $x^2 > 1/2$) downwards along the curve $r = x^4 - x^2$. This continues until the system reaches the saddle-node point at $(r,x) = (-1/4, 1/\\sqrt{2})$.\n3.  **Jump down**: At $r=-1/4$, this stable branch disappears, and the system jumps down to the only available stable state, which is back at $x=0$.\n4.  **Closing the loop**: The system then stays at $x=0$ as $r$ is brought back from $-1/4$ to $0$.\n\nThe area of the loop is given by $A = \\oint x \\, dr$. The loop is composed of the upper curve from $r=-1/4$ to $r=0$ and the lower segment along the r-axis (where $x=0$) from $r=0$ to $r=-1/4$. The vertical jumps at $r=0$ and $r=-1/4$ have $dr=0$ and do not contribute to the area.\n$$\nA = \\int_{\\text{upper path}} x \\, dr + \\int_{\\text{lower path}} x \\, dr = \\int_{-1/4}^{0} x_{\\text{upper}}(r) \\, dr + \\int_{0}^{-1/4} 0 \\, dr = \\int_{-1/4}^{0} x_{\\text{upper}}(r) \\, dr\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the area**\nIt is easier to calculate this integral by changing the integration variable from $r$ to $x$. Along the upper path, we have the parameterization $r = x^4 - x^2$, so $dr = (4x^3 - 2x) dx$. The integration limits for $r$ from $-1/4$ to $0$ on this branch correspond to $x$ going from $1/\\sqrt{2}$ to $1$.\nThe integral becomes:\n$$\nA = \\int_{1/\\sqrt{2}}^{1} x \\cdot (4x^3 - 2x) \\, dx\n$$\n$$\nA = \\int_{1/\\sqrt{2}}^{1} (4x^4 - 2x^2) \\, dx\n$$\nNow, we evaluate the integral:\n$$\nA = \\left[ \\frac{4}{5}x^5 - \\frac{2}{3}x^3 \\right]_{1/\\sqrt{2}}^{1}\n$$\n$$\nA = \\left( \\frac{4}{5}(1)^5 - \\frac{2}{3}(1)^3 \\right) - \\left( \\frac{4}{5}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^5 - \\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^3 \\right)\n$$\nWe compute the terms:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^5 = \\frac{1}{4\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\n$$\nA = \\left( \\frac{4}{5} - \\frac{2}{3} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nA = \\left( \\frac{12 - 10}{15} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{1}{5\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{2}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nA = \\frac{2}{15} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left( \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{3} \\right) = \\frac{2}{15} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left( \\frac{3 - 5}{15} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nA = \\frac{2}{15} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left( -\\frac{2}{15} \\right) = \\frac{2}{15} + \\frac{2}{15\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\n$$\nA = \\frac{2}{15} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = \\frac{2}{15} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2(2+\\sqrt{2})}{15 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{2+\\sqrt{2}}{15}\n$$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{2+\\sqrt{2}}{15}} $$", "id": "848174"}]}
