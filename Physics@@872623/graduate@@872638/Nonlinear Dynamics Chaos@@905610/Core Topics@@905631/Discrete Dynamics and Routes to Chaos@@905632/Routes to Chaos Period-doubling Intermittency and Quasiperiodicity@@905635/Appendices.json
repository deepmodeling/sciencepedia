A classic example is the quadratic map, a family of functions parameterized by a real number $r$. Consider the specific form of the quadratic map given by the iteration relation:\n$$x_{n+1} = f(x_n; r) = r - x_n^2$$\nwhere $x_n$ is the state of the system at step $n$ and $r$ is a control parameter.\n\nA fixed point of the map, denoted by $x^*$, is a value of $x$ that remains unchanged by the iteration, i.e., it satisfies the equation $x^* = f(x^*; r)$.\n\nThe stability of a fixed point $x^*$ is determined by the magnitude of the derivative of the map evaluated at that point, $\\lambda = f'(x^*; r)$. The fixed point is stable if $|\\lambda| < 1$, and unstable if $|\\lambda| > 1$. A bifurcation occurs when the stability of a fixed point changes as the parameter $r$ is varied.\n\nOne common route to chaos is through a sequence of period-doubling bifurcations. A period-doubling bifurcation occurs when the derivative passes through $-1$, i.e., $f'(x^*; r) = -1$. At this point, the stable fixed point becomes unstable, and a stable 2-cycle is born.\n\nFor the map $x_{n+1} = r - x_n^2$, a pair of fixed points is born at a certain value of $r$. As $r$ is increased, one of these fixed points will eventually become unstable.
