At each step of the construction, the measure of a parent interval is distributed among its two child intervals. The left child interval receives a fraction $p$ of the parent's measure, and the right child interval receives the remaining fraction $1-p$, where $p$ is a constant parameter with $0 \\le p \\le 1$.
