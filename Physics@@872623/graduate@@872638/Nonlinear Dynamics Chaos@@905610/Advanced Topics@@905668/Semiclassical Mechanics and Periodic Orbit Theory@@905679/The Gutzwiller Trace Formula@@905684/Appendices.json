Calculation of the Classical Action $S_p$**\n\nThe action for a trajectory of a map can be calculated from its generating function. The standard map can be described by a type-1 generating function $F_1(x_n, x_{n+1})$ which connects the coordinates at one step to the next. The momenta are given by $p_n = -\\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial x_n}$ and $p_{n+1} = \\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial x_{n+1}}$.\n\nFrom the map equation $x_{n+1} = x_n + p_{n+1}$, we can write $p_{n+1} = x_{n+1} - x_n$.\nUsing the second relation for the generating function, we have:\n$$\\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial x_{n+1}} = p_{n+1} = x_{n+1} - x_n$$\nIntegrating with respect to $x_{n+1}$ yields:\n$$F_1(x_n, x_{n+1}) = \\frac{1}{2}(x_{n+1} - x_n)^2 + g(x_n)$$\nwhere $g(x_n)$ is an arbitrary function of $x_n$.\n\nTo determine $g(x_n)$, we use the equation for $p_n$. From the map equations, we have $p_n = p_{n+1} - K\\sin(x_n) = (x_{n+1} - x_n) - K\\sin(x_n)$.\nFrom the generating function, we have:\n$$p_n = -\\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial x_n} = -\\left[-(x_{n+1} - x_n) + g'(x_n)\\right] = (x_{n+1} - x_n) - g'(x_n)$$\nComparing the two expressions for $p_n$, we find:\n$$g'(x_n) = K\\sin(x_n)$$\nIntegrating gives $g(x_n) = -K\\cos(x_n) + C$. We can set the integration constant $C$ to zero.\nSo, the generating function for one step of the map is:\n$$F_1(x_n, x_{n+1}) = \\frac{1}{2}(x_{n+1} - x_n)^2 - K\\cos(x_n)$$\nThe classical action $S_p$ for a periodic orbit of period $T$ is the sum of the generating function over the orbit's points: $S_p = \\sum_{n=0}^{T-1} F_1(x_n, x_{n+1})$.\nFor a period-1 fixed point, $T=1$ and $x_1 = x_0 = x_p$. So, the action is simply:\n$$S_p = F_1(x_p, x_p)$$\nFor the fixed point $(x_p, p_p) = (\\pi, 0)$:\n$$S_p = F_1(\\pi, \\pi) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\pi - \\pi)^2 - K\\cos(\\pi) = 0 - K(-1) = K$$\nThus, the classical action is $S_p = K$.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Maslov Index $\\mu_p$**\n\nThe Maslov index for a hyperbolic periodic orbit is determined by the properties of its monodromy matrix $M_p$. For a fixed point (period-1 orbit), the monodromy matrix is the Jacobian of the map evaluated at the fixed point.\n\nFirst, we express $(x_{n+1}, p_{n+1})$ solely in terms of $(x_n, p_n)$:\n$$p_{n+1} = p_n + K \\sin(x_n)$$\n$$x_{n+1} = x_n + p_{n+1} = x_n + p_n + K\\sin(x_n)$$\nThe Jacobian matrix is:\n$$M_p(x,p) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial x_{n+1}}{\\partial x_n} & \\frac{\\partial x_{n+1}}{\\partial p_n} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial p_{n+1}}{\\partial x_n} & \\frac{\\partial p_{n+1}}{\\partial p_n} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 + K\\cos(x) & 1 \\\\ K\\cos(x) & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nEvaluating at the fixed point $(x_p,p_p) = (\\pi, 0)$:\n$$M_p = M_p(\\pi,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 + K\\cos(\\pi) & 1 \\\\ K\\cos(\\pi) & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 - K & 1 \\\\ -K & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe stability of the fixed point is determined by the eigenvalues of $M_p$. The characteristic equation is $\\lambda^2 - \\mathrm{Tr}(M_p)\\lambda + \\det(M_p) = 0$.\n$$\\mathrm{Tr}(M_p) = (1-K) + 1 = 2-K$$\n$$\\det(M_p) = (1-K)(1) - (1)(-K) = 1-K+K = 1$$\nThe fixed point is hyperbolic (unstable) if $|\\mathrm{Tr}(M_p)| > 2$. This gives $|2-K|>2$, which leads to $K<0$ or $K>4$. The problem specifies we are in the regime $K>4$.\n\nFor $K>4$, we have $2-K < -2$, so $\\mathrm{Tr}(M_p) < -2$.\nFor a two-dimensional area-preserving map, if the trace of the monodromy matrix is less than -2, both of its eigenvalues are real and negative. An orbit with negative eigenvalues is called \"hyperbolic with reflection\" or \"inverse hyperbolic\".\n\nThe Maslov index counts contributions to the phase from topological features of the orbit. For a hyperbolic orbit in a two-dimensional system, the Maslov index is determined by the signs of the eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix.\n- If both eigenvalues are positive (direct hyperbolic, $\\mathrm{Tr}(M_p)>2$), the Maslov index is $\\mu_p=0$.\n- If both eigenvalues are negative (inverse hyperbolic, $\\mathrm{Tr}(M_p)<-2$), the Maslov index is $\\mu_p=2$.\n\nSince we are in the regime $K>4$, we have $\\mathrm{Tr}(M_p) < -2$, and the fixed point is hyperbolic with reflection. Therefore, the Maslov index is:\n$$\\mu_p = 2$$\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\nWe have calculated the action $S_p = K$ and the Maslov index $\\mu_p = 2$.
