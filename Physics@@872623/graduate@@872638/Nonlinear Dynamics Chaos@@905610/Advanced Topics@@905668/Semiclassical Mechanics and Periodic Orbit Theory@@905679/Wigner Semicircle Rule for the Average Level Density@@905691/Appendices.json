Thus, the critical strength for the spectral splitting is $\\mu_c = \\sigma$.\n\nThis can be confirmed by analyzing the condition for band edges. A band edge at energy $E$ corresponds to the cubic equation for $S(z=E)$ having repeated roots. A gap opens at $E=0$ when $E=0$ becomes a band edge. The condition for repeated roots is that the polynomial and its derivative share a root. At $z=0$, the polynomial for $S$ is $P(S) = S^3 - (\\mu^2-\\sigma^2)S = 0$, and its derivative is $P'(S) = 3S^2 - (\\mu^2-\\sigma^2) = 0$.
