The powerful self-consistent method employed here [@problem_id:855934] is a cornerstone of the modern theory of disordered systems.", "problem": "The Anderson tight-binding model on a lattice is a canonical model for studying localization phenomena due to disorder. Consider a Bethe lattice, an infinite, connected, cycle-free graph where each site is connected to $K$ neighbors (with $K \\ge 3$). The tight-binding Hamiltonian is given by:\n$$H = \\sum_i \\epsilon_i |i\\rangle\\langle i| + t \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} (|i\\rangle\\langle j| + |j\\rangle\\langle i|)$$\nwhere $|i\\rangle$ is the quantum state localized at site $i$, $t$ is the constant hopping amplitude between neighboring sites $\\langle i,j \\rangle$, and $\\epsilon_i$ are random on-site energies.

This transition can be analyzed by studying the self-consistent equation for the cavity Green's function. In the localized phase, the Green's function is purely real, and its probability distribution has a bounded support. The transition to the delocalized phase is marked by the point where no such real-valued solution can be found, forcing the Green's function to become complex.\n\nUsing this self-consistent argument based on the support of the cavity Green's function distribution, find the critical disorder strength $W_c$ for the Anderson localization transition at energy $E=0$. Express your answer in terms of the hopping amplitude $t$ and the connectivity $K$.", "solution": "We analyze the localization transition by studying the properties of the diagonal elements of the Green's function, $G_{ii}(E) = \\langle i| (E - H)^{-1} |i\\rangle$. A non-zero imaginary part of $G_{ii}(E+i0^+)$ indicates extended states at energy $E$.\n\nOn a Bethe lattice, the Green's function at a site $i$ can be written in terms of its on-site energy $\\epsilon_i$ and the self-energy $\\Sigma_i(E)$:\n$$G_{ii}(E) = \\frac{1}{E - \\epsilon_i - \\Sigma_i(E)}$$\nDue to the tree-like structure, the self-energy at site $i$ is a sum of contributions from the $K$ branches connected to it:\n$$\\Sigma_i(E) = \\sum_{j \\in \\text{neigh}(i)} t^2 g_j(E)$$\nHere, $g_j(E)$ is the \"cavity\" Green's function at the neighboring site $j$, calculated on a lattice where the branch leading back to site $i$ has been removed.\n\nSince all sites are statistically equivalent, all cavity Green's functions $g_j$ are independent and identically distributed random variables drawn from the same distribution, let's call it $P(g)$. A single such random variable $g$ must satisfy a self-consistent equation. A site on the pruned lattice (or semi-infinite branch) is connected to $K-1$ other branches.
