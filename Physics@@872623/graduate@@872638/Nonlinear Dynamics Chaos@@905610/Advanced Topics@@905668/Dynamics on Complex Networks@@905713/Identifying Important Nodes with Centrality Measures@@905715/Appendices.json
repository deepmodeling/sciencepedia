One such measure is the **betweenness centrality**.

The vertices are $V = \\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_N\\}$. An edge $(v_i, v_j)$ exists between any two distinct vertices $v_i$ and $v_j$, except for the pair $(v_1, v_2)$.\n\nBy symmetry, the betweenness centrality will be the same for all vertices $v_k$ with $k \\in \\{3, 4, \\dots, N\\}$. Let's compute it for $v_3$ (assuming $N \\ge 3$). The betweenness centrality for $v_3$ is:\n$$C_B(v_3) = \\sum_{s, t \\in V; s \\neq v_3 \\neq t} \\frac{\\sigma_{st}(v_3)}{\\sigma_{st}}$$\nA non-zero term $\\frac{\\sigma_{st}(v_3)}{\\sigma_{st}}$ occurs only if at least one shortest path from $s$ to $t$ passes through $v_3$. For a path to be a shortest path, this implies the triangle inequality becomes an equality: $d(s, t) = d(s, v_3) + d(v_3, t)$, where $d(u, w)$ denotes the shortest path distance between vertices $u$ and $w$.\n\nLet's determine the distances involving $v_3$. Since $k=3$, $v_3$ is not one of the vertices $v_1$ or $v_2$ whose direct connection was removed. Thus, $v_3$ is connected by an edge to every other vertex in the graph. Therefore, the distance from $v_3$ to any other vertex $u \\in V \\setminus \\{v_3\\}$ is 1.\n$$d(v_3, u) = 1, \\quad \\forall u \\neq v_3$$\nFor a shortest path between $s$ and $t$ (where $s, t \\neq v_3$) to pass through $v_3$, we must have:\n$$d(s, t) = d(s, v_3) + d(v_3, t) = 1 + 1 = 2$$\nSo, we need to find all ordered pairs $(s, t)$ with $s, t \\in V \\setminus \\{v_3\\}$ such that their shortest distance is 2.\n\nLet's analyze the distances between any two vertices $s, t \\in V \\setminus \\{v_3\\}$.\nThe vertices in $V \\setminus \\{v_3\\}$ are $\\{v_1, v_2, v_4, \\dots, v_N\\}$.\nIn the graph $G$, any two vertices are connected by an edge, unless they are the pair $(v_1, v_2)$.\n1.  If the pair $(s, t)$ is not $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$, then there is an edge between $s$ and $t$. For example, $(v_1, v_4)$, $(v_2, v_5)$, or $(v_4, v_5)$. In these cases, $d(s, t) = 1$. These pairs do not satisfy the condition $d(s, t) = 2$, so they do not contribute to the betweenness centrality of $v_3$.\n\n2.  If the pair $(s, t)$ is $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$, the edge $(v_1, v_2)$ does not exist in $G$. The shortest path from $v_1$ to $v_2$ must go through an intermediate vertex, say $v_m$.
