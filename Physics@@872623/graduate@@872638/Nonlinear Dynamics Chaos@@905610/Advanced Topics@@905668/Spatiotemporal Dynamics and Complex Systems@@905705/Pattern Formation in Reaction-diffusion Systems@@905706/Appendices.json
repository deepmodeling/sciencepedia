In one spatial dimension, the dimensionless reaction-diffusion equations for the concentrations of two chemical species, $u(x,t)$ and $v(x,t)$, are given by:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = A - (B+1)u + u^2v + D_u \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} = Bu - u^2v + D_v \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x^2} $$\nHere, $A$ and $B$ are positive constants related to the supply of reactant species, and $D_u$ and $D_v$ are the positive diffusion coefficients.

A Turing instability occurs when the uniform steady state $(u_0, v_0)$ becomes unstable to spatially periodic perturbations, leading to the spontaneous formation of a stationary pattern. This instability is triggered when a control parameter (in this case, $B$) is varied past a critical value $B_c$, and it first manifests for a specific critical wavenumber $k_c$.
