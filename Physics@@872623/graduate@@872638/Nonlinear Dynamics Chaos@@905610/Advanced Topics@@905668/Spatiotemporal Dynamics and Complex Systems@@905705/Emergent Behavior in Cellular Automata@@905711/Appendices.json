This first practice explores one such system, where the state of a cell depends on its own state and that of its left neighbor. Starting from a single active cell, this rule gives rise to a famous fractal pattern, the Sierpinski gasket, demonstrating a deep connection between computation, geometry, and number theory. This exercise will guide you in quantifying a macroscopic feature of this pattern—the total number of active cells—by linking the automaton's evolution to the properties of binomial coefficients [@problem_id:870565].", "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional cellular automaton defined on an infinite lattice of sites indexed by the integers $i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The state of the cell at site $i$ at time $t$ is given by $x_i^t \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, where $t$ is a non-negative integer. The system evolves according to the deterministic, local rule:\n$$x_i^{t+1} = (x_i^t + x_{i-1}^t) \\pmod 2$$\nThe automaton starts from an initial condition consisting of a single active cell at the origin:\n$$x_i^0 = \\delta_{i,0}$$\nwhere $\\delta_{i,j}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nLet $C(t)$ be the total number of active cells (cells in state 1) across the entire lattice at time $t$.

This problem introduces the Box-Ball System (BBS), a remarkable example of an \"integrable\" CA where emergent clusters of balls behave as solitons. These solitons maintain their size and shape as they travel and even pass through one another, experiencing only a \"phase shift\" in their positions. This exercise provides hands-on practice in analyzing these solitonic collisions, a key feature that connects discrete CAs to deep concepts in the physics of nonlinear waves [@problem_id:870642].", "problem": "The Box-Ball System (BBS) is a simple, discrete dynamical system that exhibits complex emergent behavior, including solitonic interactions characteristic of integrable systems. The system consists of a one-dimensional infinite lattice of boxes, where each box $i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ can either be empty ($u_i=0$) or contain a single ball ($u_i=1$).\n\nThe dynamics of the BBS cause localized patterns of balls to propagate. A particularly stable pattern is a \"soliton,\" which is a contiguous block of $L$ balls. In the BBS, a soliton of length $L$ travels at a constant velocity of $L$ sites per unit of time, without changing its shape.\n\nWhen two solitons of different lengths collide, they pass through each other, maintaining their individual identities (lengths), but their trajectories are shifted relative to where they would have been without the interaction. This is a \"phase shift.\" The rule for this phase shift is as follows:\n\nConsider a collision between a soliton of length $L_1$ and another of length $L_2$, with $L_2 > L_1$. The faster soliton (length $L_2$) experiences a forward phase shift, advancing its position by $L_1$ sites. The slower soliton (length $L_1$) experiences a backward phase shift, delaying its position by $L_2$ sites. These shifts are understood as constant displacements of the solitons' asymptotic trajectories.\n\nConsider an initial state at time $t=0$ prepared as follows:\n- A soliton of length $L_1$ is positioned such that its rightmost ball is at site $x=0$.\n- A soliton of length $L_2$ (with $L_2 > L_1$) is positioned such that its leftmost ball is at site $x=D+1$.\n- The sites between them, from $x=1$ to $x=D$, are all empty.\n\nThe system is allowed to evolve for a very long time $T$, long enough for the faster soliton to overtake the slower one and for the collision to be fully completed. After the interaction, the solitons are again well-separated, but their order is reversed. The number of empty boxes separating the two solitons, $S(T)$, will then grow linearly with time. This can be expressed as:\n$$S(T) = A + B T$$\nfor some constants $A$ and $B$.\n\nDetermine the constant term $A$.", "solution": "1.

The Greenberg-Hastings model is a classic CA for \"excitable media,\" which can represent phenomena from spreading forest fires to nerve impulses and cardiac activity. A hallmark emergent pattern in this model is the spiral wave. This exercise uses a clever thought experiment to investigate the stability of these spirals, linking a microscopic parameter of the CA—the duration of the excited state—to the macroscopic stability of the rotating wave, offering insight into how pattern formation is governed by underlying local rules [@problem_id:870589].", "problem": "The Greenberg-Hastings Cellular Automaton (GHM) is a simple model for excitable media on a discrete lattice. Consider a two-dimensional square lattice where each cell can be in one of $N$ states, labeled $s \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, N-1\\}$. The state $s=0$ is the resting (or susceptible) state. States $s \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}$ are the excited states, and states $s \\in \\{k+1, \\dots, N-1\\}$ are the refractory states. The dynamics of the system evolve in discrete time steps according to the following rules, applied synchronously to all cells:\n\n1.  A resting cell ($s=0$) becomes excited ($s \\to 1$) if at least one of its neighbors is in an excited state.\n2.  Any cell in a non-resting state ($s > 0$) updates its state to $s \\to s+1$.\n3.  The states are cyclic, so state $N-1$ updates to state $0$. This is equivalent to all non-resting updates being modulo $N$, i.e., $s \\to (s+1) \\pmod N$.\n\nFor this problem, the neighborhood of a cell consists of its four orthogonal neighbors (the von Neumann neighborhood). A common emergent pattern in the GHM is a spiral wave, which rotates around a central core. The stability of this core depends on the parameters $N$ and $k$. If the wave of excitation is too thick (i.e., $k$ is too large), the spiral cannot navigate the tight curvature at its tip and the core destabilizes, leading to meander or breakup of the spiral.\n\nWe can model this instability using a local analysis of the spiral tip as it turns a sharp corner. Consider the process of a wave turning a 90-degree corner around a pivot cell, $C_p$.\n-   At time $t=0$, the pivot cell $C_p$ is excited by a neighbor, and its state becomes $s(C_p)=1$.\n-   At $t=1$, $C_p$ evolves to state $s=2$. Its propagation excites two of its other neighbors, initiating the wave's turn.\n-   At $t=2$, these newly excited neighbors cause a \"parasitic\" excitation of a cell $C_d$ that is diagonally adjacent to $C_p$, effectively \"blunting\" the corner.\n\nThe stability of the turn, and thus the spiral core, relies on the pivot cell $C_p$ becoming refractory quickly enough to prevent this blunting. Specifically, the core is stable if and only if the pivot cell $C_p$ has entered a refractory state by the time the parasitic excitation occurs at $t=2$.\n\nDetermine the maximum integer number of excited states, $k_{max}$, for which the spiral wave core is stable according to this model.", "solution": "We track the state of the pivot cell $C_p$ over the discrete times $t=0,1,2$. By rule 2, any non-resting cell increments its state by 1 each step, and by rule 1 the pivot is excited to $s=1$ at $t=0$. Hence for $t \\le 2$ (no wrap-around yet) we have $s(t)=1+t$.\n\nThe cell enters the refractory regime when its state $s(t)$ becomes greater than $k$. The first refractory time $t_r$ must satisfy $1+t_r > k$, which means $t_r > k-1$. As $t_r$ is an integer, the first time this condition is met is at $t_r=k$.\n\nStability requires $C_p$ to be refractory by $t=2$, i.e., $t_r \\le 2$. Therefore, we need $k \\le 2$.
