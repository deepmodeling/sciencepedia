Analysis in the Center-of-Momentum (CM) Frame**\n\nThe CM frame is the rest frame of the parent particle of mass $M$. Let primed quantities refer to the CM frame.

Thus,\n$$E' = \\frac{M}{2}$$\n\nBy conservation of momentum:\n$$\\vec{0} = \\vec{p}'_1 + \\vec{p}'_2 \\implies \\vec{p}'_2 = -\\vec{p}'_1$$\nThe magnitudes of their momenta are also equal: $|\\vec{p}'_1| = |\\vec{p}'_2| = p'$.\n\nThe energy-momentum relation for each particle is $E'^2 = p'^2 + m^2$.

The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}$. The lab frame quantities are unprimed.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation for 4-momenta from the CM frame to the lab frame for a boost along the x-axis is:\n$$p_x = \\gamma(p'_x + \\beta E')$$\n$$p_y = p'_y$$\n$$p_z = p'_z$$\n$$E = \\gamma(E' + \\beta p'_x)$$\n\nApplying this to particle 1:\n$$p_{1x} = \\gamma(0 + \\beta \\frac{M}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma\\beta M$$\n$$p_{1y} = p' = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{M^2-4m^2}$$\n$$p_{1z} = 0$$\nSo, the momentum of particle 1 in the lab frame is $\\vec{p}_1 = (\\frac{1}{2}\\gamma\\beta M, \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{M^2-4m^2}, 0)$.\n\nApplying this to particle 2:\n$$p_{2x} = \\gamma(0 + \\beta \\frac{M}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma\\beta M$$\n$$p_{2y} = -p' = -\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{M^2-4m^2}$$\n$$p_{2z} = 0$$\nSo, the momentum of particle 2 in the lab frame is $\\vec{p}_2 = (\\frac{1}{2}\\gamma\\beta M, -\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{M^2-4m^2}, 0)$.\n\n**3.

The opening angle $\\phi$ between them is twice the angle $\\phi_1$ that $\\vec{p}_1$ makes with the x-axis.\n$$\\phi = 2\\phi_1$$\nTherefore, we are looking for $\\sin(\\phi/2) = \\sin(\\phi_1)$.\n\nThe angle $\\phi_1$ can be found from the components of $\\vec{p}_1$:\n$$\\tan\\phi_1 = \\frac{p_{1y}}{p_{1x}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{M^2-4m^2}}{\\frac{1}{2}\\gamma\\beta M} = \\frac{\\sqrt{M^2-4m^2}}{\\gamma\\beta M}$$\nWe can find $\\sin\\phi_1$ using the identity $\\sin\\phi_1 = \\frac{\\tan\\phi_1}{\\sqrt{1+\\tan^2\\phi_1}}$.
