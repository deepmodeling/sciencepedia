The dynamics of such collisions are governed by the conservation of the total 4-momentum.

Initial State (before the collision):**\nThe projectile particle of mass $m_p$ moves with some initial 4-momentum $P_{p,i}^\\mu = (E_{p,i}/c, \\vec{p}_{p,i})$.\nThe target particle of mass $m_t$ is stationary, so its 3-momentum is zero. Its energy is its rest energy $m_t c^2$. Thus, its 4-momentum is $P_{t,i}^\\mu = (m_t c, \\vec{0})$.\n\n**2. Final State (after the collision):**\nThe problem asks for the condition under which the projectile comes to rest. This means its final 3-momentum is zero. Its energy is then its rest energy, $m_p c^2$. The final 4-momentum of the projectile is $P_{p,f}^\\mu = (m_p c, \\vec{0})$.\nThe target particle moves off with some final 4-momentum $P_{t,f}^\\mu = (E_{t,f}/c, \\vec{p}_{t,f})$.\n\n**3.

Using the Lorentz Invariant Mass:**\nThe squared magnitude of any particle's 4-momentum is a Lorentz invariant equal to $(mc)^2$. For the final target particle, we must have:\n$$\nP_{t,f}^\\mu P_{t,f, \\mu} = (m_t c)^2\n$$\nLet's compute the square of the right-hand side of the rearranged conservation equation:\n$$\nP_{t,f}^\\mu P_{t,f, \\mu} = (P_{p,i}^\\mu + P_{t,i}^\\mu - P_{p,f}^\\mu)(P_{p,i, \\mu} + P_{t,i, \\mu} - P_{p,f, \\mu})\n$$\nExpanding the product gives:\n$$\n(m_t c)^2 = P_{p,i}^2 + P_{t,i}^2 + P_{p,f}^2 + 2 P_{p,i} \\cdot P_{t,i} - 2 P_{p,i} \\cdot P_{p,f} - 2 P_{t,i} \\cdot P_{p,f}\n$$\nwhere we use the shorthand $P^2 = P^\\mu P_\\mu$ and $A \\cdot B = A^\\mu B_\\mu$.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Terms:**\nWe can evaluate each term in the expansion using the given information:\n*   $P_{p,i}^2 = (m_p c)^2$ (invariant mass of the projectile)\n*   $P_{t,i}^2 = (m_t c)^2$ (invariant mass of the target)\n*   $P_{p,f}^2 = (m_p c)^2$ (invariant mass of the projectile)\n\nThe dot products are:\n*   $P_{p,i} \\cdot P_{t,i} = P_{p,i}^\\mu P_{t,i, \\mu} = (E_{p,i}/c, \\vec{p}_{p,i}) \\cdot (m_t c, -\\vec{0}) = (E_{p,i}/c)(m_t c) = E_{p,i} m_t$.\n*   $P_{p,i} \\cdot P_{p,f} = P_{p,i}^\\mu P_{p,f, \\mu} = (E_{p,i}/c, \\vec{p}_{p,i}) \\cdot (m_p c, -\\vec{0}) = (E_{p,i}/c)(m_p c) = E_{p,i} m_p$.\n*   $P_{t,i} \\cdot P_{p,f} = P_{t,i}^\\mu P_{p,f, \\mu} = (m_t c, \\vec{0}) \\cdot (m_p c, -\\vec{0}) = (m_t c)(m_p c) = m_t m_p c^2$.\n\n**6. Solving the Equation:**\nSubstituting these expressions back into the expanded equation:\n$$\n(m_t c)^2 = (m_p c)^2 + (m_t c)^2 + (m_p c)^2 + 2 E_{p,i} m_t - 2 E_{p,i} m_p - 2 m_t m_p c^2\n$$\nWe can cancel the $(m_t c)^2$ term from both sides and divide the entire equation by $2$:\n$$\n0 = (m_p c)^2 + E_{p,i} m_t - E_{p,i} m_p - m_t m_p c^2\n$$\nNow, we rearrange the terms by grouping factors of $E_{p,i}$ and constants:\n$$\nE_{p,i}(m_p - m_t) = (m_p c)^2 - m_t m_p c^2 = m_p c^2 (m_p - m_t)\n$$\n$$\n(E_{p,i} - m_p c^2)(m_p - m_t) = 0\n$$\n\n**7. Analyzing the Solution:**\nThis equation gives two possible conditions:\n1.  $m_p = m_t$\n2.  $E_{p,i} = m_p c^2$\n\nThe problem specifies a non-trivial collision, which means the projectile must be initially in motion. The total energy of the projectile is $E_{p,i} = \\gamma_p m_p c^2$, where $\\gamma_p = (1 - v_{p,i}^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$ is the Lorentz factor corresponding to its initial velocity $v_{p,i}$. For a moving particle, $v_{p,i} > 0$, which implies $\\gamma_p > 1$. Therefore, the initial energy of the projectile $E_{p,i}$ must be strictly greater than its rest energy $m_p c^2$.\n$$\nE_{p,i} = \\gamma_p m_p c^2 > m_p c^2\n$$\nThis means the term $(E_{p,i} - m_p c^2)$ is always non-zero (it's strictly positive).\nConsequently, the only way for the equation $(E_{p,i} - m_p c^2)(m_p - m_t) = 0$ to be satisfied for a non-trivial collision is if the other term is zero:\n$$\nm_p - m_t = 0 \\implies m_p = m_t\n$$\nThis shows that even in the relativistic case, the projectile can only be brought to rest if its mass is equal to the mass of the stationary target.
