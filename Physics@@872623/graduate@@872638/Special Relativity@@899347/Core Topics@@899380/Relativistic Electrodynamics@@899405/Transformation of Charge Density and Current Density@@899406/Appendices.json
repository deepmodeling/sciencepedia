This exercise provides a direct, hands-on verification of this fundamental law. By explicitly transforming a non-uniform charge density and the corresponding length element for a moving rod, you will see precisely how the relativistic effects of length contraction and density transformation perfectly cancel, ensuring the total charge $Q$ remains constant across all inertial frames [@problem_id:413155].", "problem": "In special relativity, the charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\mathbf{J}$ are unified into a four-vector, the four-current, $J^\\mu = (\\rho c, \\mathbf{J})$. The total electric charge $Q = \\int \\rho \\, dV$ is a Lorentz invariant. This problem is designed to verify this invariance through explicit calculation for a non-trivial charge distribution.\n\nConsider a thin rod of proper length $2L$, at rest in an inertial frame $S_0$. The rod is aligned along the $z_0$-axis, extending from $z_0 = -L$ to $z_0 = +L$. The rod carries a static, non-uniform proper line charge density (charge per unit proper length) given by the parabolic function:\n$$\n\\lambda_0(z_0) = A(L^2 - z_0^2)\n$$\nwhere $A$ is a constant with appropriate units. In its rest frame $S_0$, the rod is electrically neutral on macroscopic scales, meaning there is no net current.\n\nNow, consider a second inertial frame $S$ that moves with a constant velocity $\\mathbf{v} = v\\hat{z}$ relative to the frame $S_0$. An observer in frame $S$ measures the properties of this rod.\n\nYour task is to calculate the total charge $Q$ of the rod as measured in the moving frame $S$. To do this, you must first find the line charge density $\\lambda(z,t)$ and the spatial extent of the rod in frame $S$, and then integrate this density over the length of the rod at a fixed instant of time $t$ in frame $S$. The final answer should be expressed in terms of the given parameters $A$ and $L$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total charge of a rod as measured in a frame $S$ moving with velocity $\\mathbf{v}=v\\hat{z}$ with respect to the rod's rest frame $S_0$. The total charge is a Lorentz invariant, so the result should be the same as the total charge calculated in the rest frame. We will first calculate the charge in the rest frame $S_0$ as a reference, and then perform the full calculation in the moving frame $S$ as requested.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total charge in the rest frame $S_0$**\n\nIn the rest frame $S_0$, the total charge $Q_0$ is the integral of the proper line charge density $\\lambda_0(z_0)$ over the proper length of the rod.\n$$\nQ_0 = \\int_{-L}^{L} \\lambda_0(z_0) \\, dz_0\n$$\nSubstituting the given expression for $\\lambda_0(z_0)$:\n$$\nQ_0 = \\int_{-L}^{L} A(L^2 - z_0^2) \\, dz_0\n$$\nThe integrand is an even function, so we can simplify the integral:\n$$\nQ_0 = 2A \\int_{0}^{L} (L^2 - z_0^2) \\, dz_0 = 2A \\left[ L^2 z_0 - \\frac{z_0^3}{3} \\right]_{0}^{L}\n$$\n$$\nQ_0 = 2A \\left( L^2(L) - \\frac{L^3}{3} \\right) = 2A \\left( L^3 - \\frac{L^3}{3} \\right) = 2A \\left( \\frac{2L^3}{3} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nQ_0 = \\frac{4}{3} A L^3\n$$\nSince total charge is invariant, this must be the final answer. Now we will derive this by explicitly transforming the quantities to frame $S$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate charge densities in frame $S$ and $S_0$**\n\nLet $dQ$ be the charge in an infinitesimal segment of the rod. Charge is a scalar invariant, so $dQ$ is the same in all frames. In frame $S_0$, this charge is $dQ = dQ_0 = \\lambda_0(z_0) dz_0$, where $dz_0$ is the proper length of the segment.\nIn frame $S$, the same charge is given by $dQ = \\lambda(z,t) dz$, where $\\lambda(z,t)$ is the line charge density in $S$ and $dz$ is the length of the segment as measured in $S$.\n\nDue to length contraction, the length of the segment $dz_0$ moving parallel to its length is measured in $S$ as $dz = dz_0/\\gamma$, where $\\gamma = (1 - v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$ is the Lorentz factor.\nEquating the charge elements:\n$$\n\\lambda(z,t) dz = \\lambda_0(z_0) dz_0\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda(z,t) \\frac{dz_0}{\\gamma} = \\lambda_0(z_0) dz_0\n$$\nThis yields the transformation law for the line charge density:\n$$\n\\lambda(z,t) = \\gamma \\lambda_0(z_0)\n$$\nThe charge density in the moving frame is increased by a factor of $\\gamma$ because the same amount of charge is packed into a shorter length.\n\n**Step 3: Express the density $\\lambda$ in terms of coordinates of S**\n\nThe Lorentz transformations for the coordinates from $S_0$ to $S$ (for a boost with velocity $v$ in the $z$-direction) are:\n$t = \\gamma \\left(t_0 + \\frac{v z_0}{c^2}\\right)$\n$z = \\gamma (z_0 + v t_0)$\n\nTo find $\\lambda$ as a function of $z$ and $t$, we need to express $z_0$ in terms of $z$ and $t$. We can use the inverse Lorentz transformation:\n$z_0 = \\gamma (z - v t)$\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\lambda(z,t)$:\n$$\n\\lambda(z,t) = \\gamma \\lambda_0(\\gamma(z-vt))\n$$\nUsing the given form of $\\lambda_0$:\n$$\n\\lambda(z,t) = \\gamma A \\left( L^2 - [\\gamma(z-vt)]^2 \\right)\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Determine the integration limits in frame $S$**\n\nThe integral for the total charge in frame $S$ must be performed over the spatial extent of the rod at a single instant of time, say $t$. The ends of the rod are at fixed positions $z_{0,a}=-L$ and $z_{0,b}=+L$ in frame $S_0$. We need to find their positions $z_a$ and $z_b$ in frame $S$ at time $t$.\n\nFor the end at $z_{0,b}=+L$, its world line in $S$ is given by $z_b(t_0) = \\gamma(L + vt_0)$. The corresponding time is $t = \\gamma(t_0 + vL/c^2)$. We solve for $t_0 = t/\\gamma - vL/c^2$ and substitute it into the expression for $z_b$:\n$$\nz_b(t) = \\gamma\\left(L + v\\left(\\frac{t}{\\gamma} - \\frac{vL}{c^2}\\right)\\right) = \\gamma\\left(L + vt - \\frac{v^2L}{c^2}\\right) = \\gamma L \\left(1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right) + vt = \\frac{L}{\\gamma} + vt\n$$\nFor the end at $z_{0,a}=-L$, its world line is $z_a(t_0) = \\gamma(-L + vt_0)$ and $t = \\gamma(t_0 - vL/c^2)$. We solve for $t_0 = t/\\gamma + vL/c^2$ and substitute:\n$$\nz_a(t) = \\gamma\\left(-L + v\\left(\\frac{t}{\\gamma} + \\frac{vL}{c^2}\\right)\\right) = \\gamma\\left(-L + vt + \\frac{v^2L}{c^2}\\right) = -\\gamma L \\left(1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right) + vt = -\\frac{L}{\\gamma} + vt\n$$\nSo, at a fixed time $t$ in frame $S$, the rod occupies the interval $[ -L/\\gamma + vt, L/\\gamma + vt ]$. The length of the rod is $z_b - z_a = 2L/\\gamma$, which is the expected length-contracted result.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total charge in frame $S$**\n\nThe total charge $Q$ in frame $S$ is the integral of $\\lambda(z,t)$ over the rod's length at a fixed time $t$.\n$$\nQ = \\int_{z_a(t)}^{z_b(t)} \\lambda(z,t) \\, dz = \\int_{-L/\\gamma + vt}^{L/\\gamma + vt} \\gamma A \\left( L^2 - [\\gamma(z-vt)]^2 \\right) \\, dz\n$$\nTo solve this integral, we perform a change of variables. Let $u = \\gamma(z-vt)$. Then $du = \\gamma dz$, or $dz = du/\\gamma$. We also transform the limits of integration:\n-   Lower limit: When $z = -L/\\gamma + vt$, $u = \\gamma((-L/\\gamma + vt)-vt) = -L$.\n-   Upper limit: When $z = L/\\gamma + vt$, $u = \\gamma((L/\\gamma + vt)-vt) = +L$.\n\nSubstituting these into the integral:\n$$\nQ = \\int_{-L}^{L} \\gamma A (L^2 - u^2) \\left(\\frac{du}{\\gamma}\\right)\n$$\nThe factors of $\\gamma$ cancel out:\n$$\nQ = \\int_{-L}^{L} A(L^2 - u^2) \\, du\n$$\nThis is precisely the same integral we calculated for $Q_0$ in the rest frame $S_0$. Evaluating it gives:\n$$\nQ = A \\left[ L^2 u - \\frac{u^3}{3} \\right]_{-L}^{L} = A \\left( \\left(L^3 - \\frac{L^3}{3}\\right) - \\left(-L^3 - \\frac{(-L)^3}{3}\\right) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nQ = A \\left( \\frac{2L^3}{3} - \\left(-L^3 + \\frac{L^3}{3}\\right) \\right) = A \\left( \\frac{2L^3}{3} - \\left(-\\frac{2L^3}{3}\\right) \\right) = A \\left( \\frac{4L^3}{3} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nQ = \\frac{4}{3} A L^3\n$$\nThe result is identical to $Q_0$ and is independent of the velocity $v$, explicitly confirming that the total charge is a Lorentz invariant. The two effects—the increase in charge density by a factor of $\\gamma$ and the decrease in the length of integration by a factor of $1/\\gamma$ (due to length contraction)—exactly cancel each other out in the integrated total charge.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}AL^3} $$", "id": "413155"}, {"introduction": "One of the most profound insights of special relativity is that electric and magnetic phenomena are two sides of the same coin.
