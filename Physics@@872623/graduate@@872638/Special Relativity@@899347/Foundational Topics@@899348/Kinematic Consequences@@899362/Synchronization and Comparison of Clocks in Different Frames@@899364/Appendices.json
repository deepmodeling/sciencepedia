This exercise provides a concrete scenario to explore this \"relativity of simultaneity.\" By analyzing an attempt to synchronize stationary clocks from a moving reference frame, you will directly calculate the time discrepancy that arises, demonstrating that the very notion of a \"synchronized network\" of clocks is frame-dependent [@problem_id:406079].", "problem": "Two clocks, $C_1$ and $C_2$, are stationary in a laboratory frame, $S$. They are placed on the x-axis at positions $x_1 = -L$ and $x_2 = +L$, respectively. An observer in a frame $S'$, moving with a constant velocity $v$ along the positive x-axis relative to $S$, wishes to synchronize these two clocks according to their own simultaneity convention.\n\nThe procedure is as follows: The observer in $S'$ sends out a single light flash from a specific event point in spacetime. This point is chosen such that the light flash arrives at the worldlines of clock $C_1$ and clock $C_2$ at the same time as measured in the $S'$ frame. At these moments of arrival, the clocks $C_1$ and $C_2$ are set to show the same time, say $T_0$.\n\nAssuming this synchronization procedure is carried out successfully, what is the resulting time difference, $\\Delta T = T_2 - T_1$, between the readings of the two clocks as measured by an observer in the laboratory frame $S$?
