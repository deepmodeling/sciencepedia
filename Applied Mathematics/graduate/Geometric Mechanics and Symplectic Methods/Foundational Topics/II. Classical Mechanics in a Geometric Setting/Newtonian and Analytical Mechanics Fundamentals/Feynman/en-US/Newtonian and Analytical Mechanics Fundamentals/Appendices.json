            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the Jacobian matrix relating Cartesian and polar generalized velocities, and the expression for kinetic energy in polar coordinates for a point mass $m$ moving in a Euclidean plane. This is a fundamental problem in analytical mechanics concerning coordinate transformations on a configuration manifold $Q = \\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ and the planar polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$. The standard transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is given by:\n$$x(r, \\theta) = r \\cos\\theta$$\n$$y(r, \\theta) = r \\sin\\theta$$\n\nThe Cartesian velocity components $(\\dot{x}, \\dot{y})$ are the total time derivatives of the position coordinates.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard problem in analytical mechanics that tests the understanding of d'Alembert's principle and the method of Lagrange multipliers for holonomic constraints. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities.\n\n### Task 1: Conceptual Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins with d'Alembert's principle, which states that for any virtual displacement $\\delta q^i$ compatible with the constraints of the system, the total virtual work done by the applied forces and the inertial forces is zero. The principle is stated as:\n$$\n\\sum_{i}\\left(Q_{i}-\\left(\\frac{d}{dt}\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\dot{q}^{i}}-\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial q^{i}}\\right)\\right)\\delta q^{i}=0\n$$\nwhere $Q_i$ are the generalized applied forces, $T$ is the kinetic energy, and $q^i$ are the generalized coordinates. The term $\\frac{d}{dt}\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\dot{q}^{i}}-\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial q^{i}}$ represents the generalized inertial force. Let us denote the expression in the parentheses as $E_i = Q_{i} - \\left(\\frac{d}{dt}\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\dot{q}^{i}}-\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial q^{i}}\\right)$. Then d'Alembert's principle is $\\sum_i E_i \\delta q^i = 0$.\n\nIf the generalized coordinates $q^i$ were all independent, then the virtual displacements $\\delta q^i$ would be independent, and we could conclude that each coefficient $E_i$ must be zero. This would lead to the standard Euler-Lagrange equations for an unconstrained system (assuming conservative forces $Q_i = -\\partial V/\\partial q^i$).\n\nHowever, the system is subject to a set of $k$ holonomic constraints of the form $f_{\\alpha}(q) = 0$ for $\\alpha = 1, \\dots, k$. These constraints restrict the possible configurations of the system, and consequently, the virtual displacements $\\delta q^i$ are no longer independent. A virtual displacement is a variation in the coordinates $\\delta q^i$ that is consistent with the constraints. For the constraints $f_{\\alpha}(q)=0$, any valid virtual displacement must satisfy the condition that the constraints remain satisfied to first order. This is expressed by taking the variation of each constraint equation:\n$$\n\\delta f_{\\alpha} = \\sum_{i} \\frac{\\partial f_{\\alpha}}{\\partial q^i} \\delta q^i = 0 \\qquad (\\text{for each } \\alpha = 1, \\dots, k)\n$$\nThese $k$ equations represent linear relations among the virtual displacements $\\delta q^i$. Thus, only $n-k$ of the $\\delta q^i$ are independent, where $n$ is the total number of generalized coordinates.\n\nThe method of Lagrange multipliers provides a way to handle this situation. We have the equation from d'Alembert's principle, $\\sum_i E_i \\delta q^i = 0$, which must hold for all $\\delta q^i$ that satisfy the $k$ linear constraint equations $\\sum_i \\frac{\\partial f_{\\alpha}}{\\partial q^i} \\delta q^i = 0$. A fundamental theorem of linear algebra (or calculus, in this context) states that if a linear form $\\sum_i A_i x_i$ is zero for all $x_i$ that satisfy a set of linear constraints $\\sum_i B_{\\alpha i}x_i = 0$, then the vector of coefficients $A_i$ must be a linear combination of the vectors of constraint coefficients $B_{\\alpha i}$.\n\nApplying this theorem to our problem, we identify $A_i = E_i$, $x_i = \\delta q^i$, and $B_{\\alpha i} = \\frac{\\partial f_{\\alpha}}{\\partial q^i}$. It follows that there must exist a set of $k$ multipliers, $\\lambda_{\\alpha}$, which can be functions of time, such that:\n$$\nE_i = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{k} \\lambda_{\\alpha} \\frac{\\partial f_{\\alpha}}{\\partial q^i}\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of $E_i$ back into this equation gives:\n$$\nQ_{i} - \\left(\\frac{d}{dt}\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\dot{q}^{i}}-\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial q^{i}}\\right) = \\sum_{\\alpha} \\lambda_{\\alpha} \\frac{\\partial f_{\\alpha}}{\\partial q^i}\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged into the form of modified Euler-Lagrange equations:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\dot{q}^{i}}-\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial q^{i}} = Q_{i} - \\sum_{\\alpha} \\lambda_{\\alpha} \\frac{\\partial f_{\\alpha}}{\\partial q^i}\n$$\nThe term $\\sum_{\\alpha} \\lambda_{\\alpha} \\frac{\\partial f_{\\alpha}}{\\partial q^i}$ can be interpreted as a generalized force. Specifically, it is the generalized force of constraint, $Q_i^{(c)}$, that arises from the requirement to maintain the holonomic constraints. By convention, the constraint force is often moved to the right-hand side of the Euler-Lagrange equations, leading to:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}^{i}} - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q^{i}} = \\sum_{\\alpha} \\lambda_{\\alpha} \\frac{\\partial f_{\\alpha}}{\\partial q^{i}}\n$$\nwhere we have used the Lagrangian $L=T-V$ and assumed the applied forces are conservative, $Q_i = -\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial q^i}$. The term on the right, which we can call $Q_i^{\\text{constraint}}$, is precisely the generalized constraint force, $Q^{(c)}_{i}=\\sum_{\\alpha}\\lambda_{\\alpha}\\,\\frac{\\partial f_{\\alpha}}{\\partial q^{i}}$, that must be added to the dynamics to enforce the constraints. The multipliers $\\lambda_\\alpha$ are determined by requiring the solution $q^i(t)$ to satisfy the constraint equations $f_\\alpha(q(t))=0$ for all time.\n\n### Task 2: Computation\n\nWe now apply this formalism to the specific problem.\nThe generalized coordinates are $q^1 = r$ and $q^2 = \\theta$.\nThe Lagrangian is $L = T - V$, with $T = \\frac{1}{2}m(\\dot{r}^2 + r^2\\dot{\\theta}^2)$ and $V = V(r)$.\n$$\nL(r, \\theta, \\dot{r}, \\dot{\\theta}) = \\frac{1}{2}m(\\dot{r}^2 + r^2\\dot{\\theta}^2) - V(r)\n$$\nThe system has a single holonomic constraint, $f(r, \\theta) = r - R = 0$.\n\nThe modified Euler-Lagrange equations are:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}^i} - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q^i} = \\lambda \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q^i}\n$$\nWe derive these for each coordinate.\n\nFor $q^1 = r$:\nThe required partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{r}} = m\\dot{r} \\implies \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{r}}\\right) = m\\ddot{r}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial r} = mr\\dot{\\theta}^2 - \\frac{dV}{dr}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r-R) = 1\n$$\nThe Euler-Lagrange equation for the $r$ coordinate is:\n$$\nm\\ddot{r} - \\left(mr\\dot{\\theta}^2 - \\frac{dV}{dr}\\right) = \\lambda (1)\n$$\n$$\nm\\ddot{r} - mr\\dot{\\theta}^2 + \\frac{dV}{dr} = \\lambda\n$$\n\nFor $q^2 = \\theta$:\nThe required partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}} = mr^2\\dot{\\theta}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}(r-R) = 0\n$$\nThe Euler-Lagrange equation for the $\\theta$ coordinate is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(mr^2\\dot{\\theta}) - 0 = \\lambda(0)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(mr^2\\dot{\\theta}) = 0\n$$\nThis equation shows that the angular momentum, $p_{\\theta} = mr^2\\dot{\\theta}$, is a conserved quantity.\n\nTo find the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda(t)$, we use the $r$-equation along with the constraint conditions. The constraint is $r = R$ for all time $t$. This implies that the velocity and acceleration in the radial direction must be zero:\n$$\nr(t) = R \\implies \\dot{r}(t) = 0 \\text{ and } \\ddot{r}(t) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting these conditions into the $r$-equation of motion:\n$$\nm(0) - mR\\dot{\\theta}^2 + \\left.\\frac{dV}{dr}\\right|_{r=R} = \\lambda\n$$\nThis gives the expression for the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda(t)$. Using the notation $V'(R) = \\left.\\frac{dV}{dr}\\right|_{r=R}$:\n$$\n\\lambda(t) = V'(R) - mR\\dot{\\theta}^2\n$$\nThe value of $\\lambda(t)$ is interpreted as the generalized force of constraint corresponding to the coordinate $r$. Since $q^1=r$, this is the physical radial force exerted by the constraint mechanism to keep the particle on the circle of radius $R$. This force must be of a magnitude such that the net radial force (potential force plus constraint force) equals the required centripetal force. That is, $-V'(R) + \\lambda = -mR\\dot{\\theta}^2$. Solving for $\\lambda$ gives the result: $\\lambda(t) = V'(R) - mR\\dot{\\theta}^2$. Note that $\\dot{\\theta}$ can be a function of time, $\\dot{\\theta}(t)$, unless the potential happens to be zero or constant, in which case the $\\theta$-equation for constant $r=R$ implies $\\ddot{\\theta}=0$. $\\dot{\\theta}$ is not necessarily constant.

A Lagrangian for which $\\det(W) = 0$ is called a singular or degenerate Lagrangian.\n\nFor our system, the Hessian matrix is\n$$\nW =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} L}{\\partial \\dot{x}^{2}} & \\frac{\\partial^{2} L}{\\partial \\dot{x}\\partial \\dot{y}} & \\frac{\\partial^{2} L}{\\partial \\dot{x}\\partial \\dot{z}} & \\frac{\\partial^{2} L}{\\partial \\dot{x}\\partial \\dot{w}} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} L}{\\partial \\dot{y}\\partial \\dot{x}} & \\frac{\\partial^{2} L}{\\partial \\dot{y}^{2}} & \\frac{\\partial^{2} L}{\\partial \\dot{y}\\partial \\dot{z}} & \\frac{\\partial^{2} L}{\\partial \\dot{y}\\partial \\dot{w}} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} L}{\\partial \\dot{z}\\partial \\dot{x}} & \\frac{\\partial^{2} L}{\\partial \\dot{z}\\partial \\dot{y}} & \\frac{\\partial^{2} L}{\\partial \\dot{z}^{2}} & \\frac{\\partial^{2} L}{\\partial \\dot{z}\\partial \\dot{w}} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} L}{\\partial \\dot{w}\\partial \\dot{x}} & \\frac{\\partial^{2} L}{\\partial \\dot{w}\\partial \\dot{y}} & \\frac{\\partial^{2} L}{\\partial \\dot{w}\\partial \\dot{z}} & \\frac{\\partial^{2} L}{\\partial \\dot{w}^{2}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nm_{x} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & m_{y} \\nu(x) & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe determinant of this matrix is manifestly zero: $\\det(W) = m_{x} \\cdot m_{y}\\nu(x) \\cdot 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$. The Lagrangian is singular. The rank of the Hessian is $2$, which is less than the dimension of the configuration space, $4$. The number of primary constraints is equal to the co-rank of the Hessian, which is $\\text{dim}(Q) - \\text{rank}(W) = 4 - 2 = 2$.\n\nThese constraints are functions on the phase space $T^{*}Q$ that must vanish for any physical trajectory. Conventionally, we write them in the form $\\phi(q,p) = 0$. From our derived momentum relations:\nThe first constraint is $\\phi_{1}(q,p) = p_{z} - \\alpha(x,y) = 0$.\nThe second constraint is $\\phi_{2}(q,p) = p_{w} - \\beta(y,w) = 0$.\n\nThese are the two primary constraints enforced by the structure of the given Lagrangian. They arise directly because the Lagrangian is linear, rather than quadratic, in the velocities $\\dot{z}$ and $\\dot{w}$, leading to a singular velocity Hessian. The image of the Legendre map is therefore not the entire cotangent bundle $T^{*}Q$, but rather the submanifold defined by $\\phi_1 = 0$ and $\\phi_2 = 0$.\n\nThe problem asks for the primary constraint set as a single row matrix. We assemble the derived constraint functions into this format.\nThe first constraint function is $\\phi_{1}(q,p) = p_{z} - \\alpha(x,y)$.\nThe second constraint function is $\\phi_{2}(q,p) = p_{w} - \\beta(y,w)$.\nThe resulting row matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} p_{z} - \\alpha(x,y) & p_{w} - \\beta(y,w) \\end{pmatrix}$.",
