The problem requires using the fundamental definition $\\omega_{0}(S_{a} u, S_{a} v) = \\omega_{0}(u,v)$ for all $u, v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\nLet $u = \\begin{pmatrix} q_{1} \\\\ p_{1} \\end{pmatrix}$ and $v = \\begin{pmatrix} q_{2} \\\\ p_{2} \\end{pmatrix}$ be two arbitrary vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\nThe value of the symplectic form on these vectors is:\n$$\n\\omega_{0}(u,v) = u^{\\top} J v = \\begin{pmatrix} q_{1}  p_{1} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ -1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} q_{2} \\\\ p_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} q_{1}  p_{1} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} p_{2} \\\\ -q_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = q_{1}p_{2} - p_{1}q_{2}\n$$\nNow, we apply the transformation $S_{a}$ to both vectors:\n$$\nS_{a} u = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ a  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} q_{1} \\\\ p_{1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} q_{1} \\\\ aq_{1} + p_{1} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nS_{a} v = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ a  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} q_{2} \\\\ p_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} q_{2} \\\\ aq_{2} + p_{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute the symplectic form on the transformed vectors:\n$$\n\\omega_{0}(S_{a} u, S_{a} v) = (S_{a} u)^{\\top} J (S_{a} v) = \\begin{pmatrix} q_{1}  aq_{1} + p_{1} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ -1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} q_{2} \\\\ aq_{2} + p_{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_{0}(S_{a} u, S_{a} v) = \\begin{pmatrix} q_{1}  aq_{1} + p_{1} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} aq_{2} + p_{2} \\\\ -q_{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_{0}(S_{a} u, S_{a} v) = q_{1}(aq_{2} + p_{2}) - (aq_{1} + p_{1})q_{2} = aq_{1}q_{2} + q_{1}p_{2} - aq_{1}q_{2} - p_{1}q_{2} = q_{1}p_{2} - p_{1}q_{2}\n$$\nComparing the results, we find that $\\omega_{0}(S_{a} u, S_{a} v) = \\omega_{0}(u,v)$, which verifies that the map $S_{a}$ is a symplectomorphism.\n\nSecond, we verify that $S_{a}$ is not orthogonal with respect to the Euclidean metric $g$ for $a \\neq 0$. A linear transformation $S$ is orthogonal if and only if it preserves the inner product, i.e., $g(Su, Sv) = g(u,v)$ for all vectors $u, v$. We can show this is not the case by finding a counterexample.\nLet us choose the standard basis vector $u = e_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe metric evaluated on this vector with itself is its squared norm:\n$$\ng(e_{1}, e_{1}) = e_{1}^{\\top} e_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 1\n$$\nNow, we apply the transformation $S_{a}$ to $e_{1}$:\n$$\nS_{a} e_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ a  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ a \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute the metric for the transformed vector:\n$$\ng(S_{a} e_{1}, S_{a} e_{1}) = (S_{a} e_{1})^{\\top} (S_{a} e_{1}) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  a \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ a \\end{pmatrix} = 1^{2} + a^{2} = 1+a^{2}\n$$\nThe condition for orthogonality would require $g(S_{a} e_{1}, S_{a} e_{1}) = g(e_{1}, e_{1})$, which means $1+a^{2} = 1$. This implies $a^{2}=0$, and therefore $a=0$. However, the problem specifies that $a \\neq 0$. Thus, for any $a \\neq 0$, we have $g(S_{a} e_{1}, S_{a} e_{1}) = 1+a^{2} \\neq 1 = g(e_{1}, e_{1})$. This demonstrates that $S_{a}$ is not an orthogonal transformation for $a \\neq 0$.\n\nThird, we compute the scalar $g(S_{a} e_{1}, S_{a} e_{1})$ as a closed-form expression in terms of $a$. This calculation was performed in the second step to demonstrate non-orthogonality. We repeat it here for completeness as the final part of the problem.\nThe vector $e_{1}$ is given by $e_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nApplying the map $S_{a}$ gives:\n$$\nS_{a} e_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ a  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ a \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe scalar $g(S_{a} e_{1}, S_{a} e_{1})$ is computed using the definition of the metric $g(u,v) = u^{\\top}v$:\n$$\ng(S_{a} e_{1}, S_{a} e_{1}) = \\left(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ a \\end{pmatrix}\\right)^{\\top} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ a \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  a \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ a \\end{pmatrix} = 1 \\cdot 1 + a \\cdot a = 1+a^{2}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression.",

The equations of motion are $\\dot{z}(t) = X_H(z(t))$, which in coordinates are:\n$$ \\dot{q}^i = 0 $$\n$$ \\dot{p}_i = c_i $$\nIntegrating these equations from an initial state $(q_0, p_0)$ at $t=0$, we obtain the flow:\n$$ q^i(t) = q_0^i $$\n$$ p_i(t) = p_{0i} + c_i t $$\nThe flow map is therefore $\\varphi_t(q_0, p_0) = (q_0, p_0 + t c)$. Evaluating at $t=1$:\n$$ \\varphi_1(q_0, p_0) = (q_0, p_0 + c) = \\Phi_c(q_0, p_0) $$\nThis demonstrates that $\\Phi_c$ is the time-$1$ map of a Hamiltonian flow. Since Hamiltonian flows are composed of symplectomorphisms and $\\Phi_c$ is a diffeomorphism (with inverse $\\Phi_{-c}$), it is a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism.

The dimension of a Lagrangian subspace in a $2n$-dimensional symplectic space is always $n$.\n5.  **Characteristic Distribution**: For a coisotropic subspace $S$, the characteristic distribution is the vector subbundle of the tangent bundle $TS$ whose fiber at each point $x \\in S$ is the vector space $(T_xS)^\\omega$. Since $S$ is a linear subspace of $V$, its tangent space $T_xS$ at any point $x \\in S$ can be identified with $S$ itself. Therefore, the characteristic distribution is constant and is given by the vector space $S^\\omega$. The dimension of this distribution is $\\dim(S^\\omega)$.\n\nWe now analyze the subspace $Q$.\nThe subspace $Q$ is defined as $Q = \\{(q, p) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2n} \\mid p_1 = \\cdots = p_n = 0\\}$.

Since $Q^\\omega = Q$, the dimension of the characteristic distribution on $Q$ is:\n$$ \\dim(Q^\\omega) = \\dim(Q) = n $$\nThe characteristic foliation is the foliation of $Q$ by the integral manifolds of the distribution $Q^\\omega=Q$. Since the distribution is the entire tangent space at every point, the foliation is trivial, consisting of a single leaf, which is $Q$ itself.\n\nNext, we analyze the subspace $P$.\nThe subspace $P$ is defined as $P = \\{(q, p) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2n} \\mid q^1 = \\cdots = q^n = 0\\}$.

This means the vector $v$ must have the form $v = (0, \\delta p)$, which is precisely the condition for a vector to be in $P$.\nTherefore, we have shown that $P^\\omega = P$.\n\nSince $P^\\omega = P$, the condition $P^\\omega \\subseteq P$ is satisfied, which means $P$ is a coisotropic subspace. (Like $Q$, $P$ is also a Lagrangian subspace.)\n\nThe characteristic distribution on $P$ is the vector space $P^\\omega$. Since $P^\\omega = P$, the dimension of the characteristic distribution on $P$ is:\n$$ \\dim(P^\\omega) = \\dim(P) = n $$\nThe characteristic foliation on $P$ is likewise trivial, with $P$ itself being the only leaf.\n\nThe problem asks for the dimensions of the characteristic distributions on $Q$ and $P$.
