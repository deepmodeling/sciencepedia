            "solution": "We proceed in three steps, starting from the foundational properties of the exterior derivative, the wedge product, and the definition of nondegeneracy for bilinear forms.\n\nStep 1: Closedness. We compute $d\\omega$ using the axioms that $d$ is a graded derivation of degree $+1$ and that $d(dx^{i})=d(dy^{i})=0$. For each term of $\\omega$,\n$$\nd\\big(dx^{i} \\wedge dy^{i}\\big) \\;=\\; d(dx^{i}) \\wedge dy^{i} \\;-\\; dx^{i} \\wedge d(dy^{i}) \\;=\\; 0 \\wedge dy^{i} \\;-\\; dx^{i} \\wedge 0 \\;=\\; 0.\n$$\nSumming over $i$ gives $d\\omega = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} d(dx^{i} \\wedge dy^{i}) = 0$. Hence $\\omega$ is closed.\n\nStep 2: Nondegeneracy. Fix a point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ with coordinate frame $\\{\\partial_{x^{1}},\\dots,\\partial_{x^{n}},\\partial_{y^{1}},\\dots,\\partial_{y^{n}}\\}$ of $T_{p}\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. We compute the pairings:\n- $\\omega(\\partial_{x^{i}},\\partial_{x^{j}}) = 0$ because $dx^{k} \\wedge dy^{k}$ vanishes on two $x$-directions.\n- $\\omega(\\partial_{y^{i}},\\partial_{y^{j}}) = 0$ similarly.\n- $\\omega(\\partial_{x^{i}},\\partial_{y^{j}}) = \\delta_{ij}$, because $(dx^{i} \\wedge dy^{i})(\\partial_{x^{i}},\\partial_{y^{j}}) = \\delta_{ij}$ and all other $k \\neq i$ terms vanish.\n- By antisymmetry, $\\omega(\\partial_{y^{j}},\\partial_{x^{i}}) = -\\delta_{ij}$.\n\nRelative to the ordered basis $(\\partial_{x^{1}},\\dots,\\partial_{x^{n}},\\partial_{y^{1}},\\dots,\\partial_{y^{n}})$, the bilinear form $\\omega$ has matrix\n$$\n[\\omega] \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & I_{n} \\\\ -I_{n} & 0 \\end{pmatrix},\n$$\nwhere $I_{n}$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix. To verify nondegeneracy, it suffices to show $[\\omega]$ is invertible. Observe that\n$$\n[\\omega]^{2} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & I_{n} \\\\ -I_{n} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{2} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix} -I_{n} & 0 \\\\ 0 & -I_{n} \\end{pmatrix} \\;=\\; -I_{2n}.\n$$\nTaking determinants gives $\\det([\\omega])^{2} = \\det(-I_{2n}) = (-1)^{2n} = 1$, so $\\det([\\omega]) = \\pm 1 \\neq 0$. Therefore $[\\omega]$ is invertible, and the contraction map $v \\mapsto \\iota_{v}\\omega$ is injective. Hence $\\omega$ is nondegenerate at every point.\n\nStep 3: Compute $\\omega^{n}$. Write $\\alpha_{i} := dx^{i} \\wedge dy^{i}$. Then $\\omega = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\alpha_{i}$. Each $\\alpha_{i}$ is a $2$-form, and for even-degree forms the graded-commutativity yields $\\alpha_{i} \\wedge \\alpha_{j} = \\alpha_{j} \\wedge \\alpha_{i}$. Expand $\\omega^{n}$ using the multinomial expansion in the graded-commutative algebra:\n$$\n\\omega^{n} \\;=\\; \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\alpha_{i}\\right)^{n}.\n$$\nAny term involving a repeated index $\\alpha_{i} \\wedge \\alpha_{i}$ vanishes because $\\alpha_{i} \\wedge \\alpha_{i} = 0$ for a $2$-form. Therefore, the only surviving terms are wedges of $n$ distinct $\\alpha_{i}$, i.e., $\\alpha_{\\sigma(1)} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\alpha_{\\sigma(n)}$ for permutations $\\sigma$ of $\\{1,\\dots,n\\}$. Since the $\\alpha_{i}$ commute pairwise, all such terms are equal to $\\alpha_{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\alpha_{n}$. There are $n!$ permutations, so\n$$\n\\omega^{n} \\;=\\; n!\\, \\alpha_{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\alpha_{n}.\n$$\nFinally, expand the product of the $\\alpha_{i}$:\n$$\n\\alpha_{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\alpha_{n} \\;=\\; (dx^{1} \\wedge dy^{1}) \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge (dx^{n} \\wedge dy^{n}) \\;=\\; dx^{1} \\wedge dy^{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{n} \\wedge dy^{n},\n$$\nsince $2$-forms commute and the indicated order already matches the target order. Thus there exists a scalar $c_{n}$ with\n$$\n\\omega^{n} \\;=\\; c_{n}\\, dx^{1} \\wedge dy^{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{n} \\wedge dy^{n},\n$$\nand the computation shows $c_{n} = n!$.\n\nTherefore, $\\omega$ is closed and nondegenerate, and the requested scalar is $c_{n} = n!$.",
