The manifold is $M = \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ with global coordinates given by $(x^1, \\dots, x^{2n}) = (q^1, \\dots, q^n, p_1, \\dots, p_n)$. In this coordinate system, the basis for $T_x M$ is $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^1}, \\dots, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{2n}}\\}$ and the basis for $T_x^* M$ is $\\{dx^1, \\dots, dx^{2n}\\}$.

The indices from $1$ to $n$ correspond to the $q$ coordinates, and indices from $n+1$ to $2n$ correspond to the $p$ coordinates.\nThe matrix of components for $\\omega_0$ is:\n$$\n\\Omega = (\\omega_{jk}) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0_n  I_n \\\\ -I_n  0_n \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $0_n$ is the $n \\times n$ zero matrix and $I_n$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix.\n\nThe problem defines the Poisson bivector $\\pi$ as the inverse of the symplectic form $\\omega_0$.

We use a standard property for the determinant of block matrices. For a matrix $M = \\begin{pmatrix} A  B \\\\ C  D \\end{pmatrix}$, if the blocks $C$ and $D$ commute (i.e., $CD=DC$), then $\\det(M) = \\det(AD-BC)$. In our case, $A=0_n$, $B=I_n$, $C=-I_n$, and $D=0_n$. The blocks $C$ and $D$ commute since $CD = (-I_n)(0_n) = 0_n$ and $DC = (0_n)(-I_n) = 0_n$. Thus, we can apply the formula:\n$$\n\\det(\\Omega) = \\det( (0_n)(0_n) - (I_n)(-I_n) ) = \\det(0_n - (-I_n)) = \\det(I_n) = 1\n$$\nThe determinant of the component matrix of the standard symplectic form is $1$.\n\nSubstituting this result back into our equation $\\det(\\Pi) \\det(\\Omega) = 1$:\n$$\n\\det(\\Pi) \\cdot 1 = 1\n$$\nThis yields:\n$$\n\\det(\\Pi) = 1\n$$\nTherefore, the determinant of the matrix of components of the Poisson bivector is $\\det(\\pi^{ij}(x)) = 1$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the degeneracy locus of $\\pi$. This locus is defined as the set of points $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ where the matrix $\\Pi(x) = (\\pi^{ij}(x))$ is degenerate, i.e., non-invertible. A matrix is degenerate if and only if its determinant is zero.\nThe degeneracy locus is thus $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2n} : \\det(\\pi^{ij}(x)) = 0\\}$.\nSince we have shown that $\\det(\\pi^{ij}(x))=1$ for all $x$, the condition $\\det(\\pi^{ij}(x)) = 0$ is never satisfied. The degeneracy locus is the empty set, $\\emptyset$.\n\nThis result encodes the non-degeneracy of the Poisson bivector $\\pi$. The invertibility of the matrix of components $\\pi^{ij}(x)$ at a point $x$ is equivalent to the non-degeneracy of the bivector $\\pi$ at that point. A symplectic form $\\omega$, by definition, must be non-degenerate. This means that the associated map $\\omega^{\\flat}: TM \\to T^*M$ is an isomorphism at every point. The Poisson bivector is constructed from the inverse map $\\pi^{\\sharp} = (\\omega^{\\flat})^{-1}$, which is therefore also an isomorphism at every point. An isomorphism corresponds to an invertible matrix of components in any local coordinate system. The determinant of this matrix being non-zero is the algebraic condition for invertibility. Our calculation confirms this fundamental property: the determinant is not only non-zero, but it is constant and equal to $1$ everywhere on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. The fact that the degeneracy locus is empty signifies that there is no \"failure of invertibility\" for the Poisson bivector $\\pi$ anywhere on the manifold, a direct consequence of the non-degeneracy of the symplectic form $\\omega_0$.",

Second, we must classify all such constant Poisson structures up to linear changes of coordinates and find their canonical form.\n\n### Part 1: Condition for the Jacobi Identity\n\nThe bracket is defined on $C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ by $\\{f,g\\} = \\pi^{ij}\\,\\partial_{i}f\\,\\partial_{j}g$ for $f,g \\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, where $\\pi^{ij}$ are constant coefficients satisfying $\\pi^{ij} = -\\pi^{ji}$. The summation over repeated indices is implied. A bracket defines a Poisson structure if it is bilinear, skew-symmetric, satisfies the Leibniz rule (i.e., is a derivation in each slot), and satisfies the Jacobi identity.\n\n1.  **Bilinearity**: The bracket is bilinear in $f$ and $g$ because the partial derivatives are linear operators and the expression is a sum of products.\n2.  **Skew-symmetry**: We check $\\{g,f\\} = \\pi^{ij}\\,\\partial_{i}g\\,\\partial_{j}f$. By relabeling the summation indices ($i \\leftrightarrow j$), this becomes $\\pi^{ji}\\,\\partial_{j}g\\,\\partial_{i}f$.

Thus, the bracket is skew-symmetric.\n3.  **Leibniz Rule**: We check if it is a derivation, e.g., in the second argument: $\\{f, gh\\} = \\pi^{ij}\\,\\partial_{i}f\\,\\partial_{j}(gh) = \\pi^{ij}\\,\\partial_{i}f\\,(g\\,\\partial_{j}h + h\\,\\partial_{j}g) = g\\,(\\pi^{ij}\\,\\partial_{i}f\\,\\partial_{j}h) + h\\,(\\pi^{ij}\\,\\partial_{i}f\\,\\partial_{j}g) = g\\{f,h\\} + h\\{f,g\\}$. The Leibniz rule holds.\n4.  **Jacobi Identity**: The identity is $\\{\\{f,g\\},h\\} + \\{\\{g,h\\},f\\} + \\{\\{h,f\\},g\\} = 0$.\nThe most direct way to verify this is by using the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket. A bivector field $\\pi$ defines a Poisson bracket if and only if its Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket with itself, $[\\pi, \\pi]_{SN}$, vanishes. For a bivector field $\\pi = \\frac{1}{2}\\pi^{ij}(x) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j}}$, the components of $[\\pi, \\pi]_{SN}$ are given by the trivector field:\n$$ [\\pi, \\pi]_{SN} = \\frac{1}{6} \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n \\left( \\pi^{ki} \\frac{\\partial\\pi^{jl}}{\\partial x^k} + \\pi^{kj} \\frac{\\partial\\pi^{li}}{\\partial x^k} + \\pi^{kl} \\frac{\\partial\\pi^{ij}}{\\partial x^k} \\right) \\right) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^l} $$\nIn this problem, the coefficients $\\pi^{ij}$ are explicitly stated to be constant.

The set of coefficients for which the Jacobi identity holds is the entire set of constant, skew-symmetric $n \\times n$ matrices.\n\n### Part 2: Classification and Canonical Form\n\nWe are asked to classify these constant Poisson structures up to an invertible linear change of coordinates on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Let the coordinate transformation be $y \\mapsto x(y)$, where $x^{i} = A^{i}_{j} y^{j}$ for some invertible matrix $A \\in GL(n, \\mathbb{R})$. The vector fields transform as $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k} = \\frac{\\partial x^i}{\\partial y^k} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} = A^i_k \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}$. The inverse transformation is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} = (A^{-1})^j_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^j}$.\n\nThe bivector $\\pi$ is a tensor and must be invariant under this change of coordinates. In the new coordinates $(y^1, \\dots, y^n)$, let the bivector have components $\\tilde{\\pi}^{kl}$.\n$$ \\pi = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi^{ij} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j} = \\frac{1}{2} \\tilde{\\pi}^{kl} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l} $$\nSubstituting the transformation rule for the basis vectors:\n$$ \\pi = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi^{ij} \\left( (A^{-1})^k_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k} \\right) \\wedge \\left( (A^{-1})^l_j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\pi^{ij} (A^{-1})^k_i (A^{-1})^l_j \\right] \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^l} $$\nThis gives the transformation rule for the component matrix $\\Pi = (\\pi^{ij})$:\n$$ \\tilde{\\Pi} = (A^{-1}) \\Pi (A^{-1})^T $$\nThis transformation, $\\Pi \\mapsto B \\Pi B^T$ with $B$ invertible, is known as a congruence transformation. The problem is thus reduced to finding a canonical form for a real, skew-symmetric matrix $\\Pi$ under congruence.\n\nThis is a standard result from linear algebra. A skew-symmetric matrix is classified by its rank, which is always an even integer. Let $\\operatorname{rank}(\\Pi) = 2r$. The number $r$ is a non-negative integer such that $2r \\le n$, or $0 \\le r \\le \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$. For each such $r$, there exists a basis (or a linear coordinate system) in which the matrix of the bivector takes a canonical block-diagonal form.\n\nLet's construct this basis. Let $V = \\mathbb{R}^n$. The matrix $\\Pi$ defines a skew-symmetric bilinear form on $V$.\n1.  Let $W = \\ker(\\Pi) = \\{ v \\in V \\mid \\Pi v = 0 \\}$. The dimension of the kernel is $\\dim(W) = n - \\operatorname{rank}(\\Pi) = n-2r$. We choose a basis $\\{g_1, \\dots, g_{n-2r}\\}$ for $W$. These will correspond to the vector fields $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^k}$. In these directions, the Poisson bracket is null.\n\n2.  Let $U$ be the orthogonal complement of $W$ with respect to the standard dot product. Then $V = U \\oplus W$, and $\\dim(U) = 2r$. The restriction of the bilinear form defined by $\\Pi$ to $U$ is non-degenerate.\n\n3.  We now construct a \"symplectic\" basis for $U$. Pick an arbitrary non-zero vector $e_1 \\in U$. Since the form is non-degenerate on $U$, there must exist a vector $v \\in U$ such that $e_1^T \\Pi v \\neq 0$. We can normalize this vector to get a vector $f_1$ such that $e_1^T \\Pi f_1 = 1$. Note that $e_1^T \\Pi e_1 = 0$ and $f_1^T \\Pi f_1 = 0$ due to skew-symmetry. The vectors $e_1, f_1$ are linearly independent.\n\n4.  Let $U_1 = \\operatorname{span}\\{e_1, f_1\\}$. The matrix of the form restricted to $U_1$ in this basis is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ -1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n5.  Let $U_1^{\\perp} = \\{ u \\in U \\mid u^T\\Pi v = 0 \\text{ for all } v \\in U_1 \\}$. Because the form is non-degenerate on $U_1$, we have $U = U_1 \\oplus U_1^{\\perp}$. The form restricted to $U_1^{\\perp}$ is also non-degenerate, and its dimension is $2r-2$.\n\n6.  We can proceed by induction, repeating this process on $U_1^{\\perp}$ to find a basis $\\{e_2, f_2\\}$ for a subspace $U_2$, and so on. This decomposes $U$ into a direct sum of $r$ two-dimensional \"symplectic planes\": $U = U_1 \\oplus U_2 \\oplus \\dots \\oplus U_r$. This gives us a basis $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_r, f_1, \\dots, f_r\\}$ for $U$.\n\nBy choosing the linear transformation $A$ to be the one that maps the standard basis to our new basis $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_r, f_1, \\dots, f_r, g_1, \\dots, g_{n-2r}\\}$ and identifying these with the coordinate vector fields $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^1}, \\dots, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^r}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^1}, \\dots, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^r}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^1}, \\dots, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^{n-2r}}\\}$, the matrix $\\tilde{\\Pi}$ of the bivector will have the block structure:\n$$ \\tilde{\\Pi} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0_r  I_r  0 \\\\ -I_r  0_r  0 \\\\ 0  0  0_{n-2r} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nwhere $I_r$ is the $r \\times r$ identity matrix and $0_k$ is the $k \\times k$ zero matrix.\nThe non-zero components are $\\tilde{\\pi}^{ij} = 0$ except for $\\tilde{\\pi}^{i, r+j} = \\delta_{ij}$ and $\\tilde{\\pi}^{r+i, j} = -\\delta_{ij}$ for $i,j \\in \\{1,\\dots,r\\}$, using an index mapping where $x^i$ maps to indices $1, \\dots, r$ and $y^j$ maps to indices $r+1, \\dots, 2r$.\n\nThe bivector $\\pi$ is written as $\\pi = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{a,b=1}^n \\tilde{\\pi}^{ab} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u^a} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u^b}$, where $u$ represents the new coordinates. With the coordinate ordering $(x^1,...,x^r,y^1,...,y^r,z^1,...)$, we have:\n$$ \\pi_r = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j=1}^r \\left( \\tilde{\\pi}^{x^i,y^j} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^j} + \\tilde{\\pi}^{y^j,x^i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^j} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\right) $$\nIn terms of our matrix, $\\tilde{\\pi}^{x^i, y^j} = 1$ if $i=j$ and $0$ otherwise. So, $\\tilde{\\pi}^{x^i,y^j} = \\delta^{ij}$. Similarly, $\\tilde{\\pi}^{y^j,x^i} = -\\delta^{ij}$.\n$$ \\pi_r = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^r \\left( 1 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^i} + (-1) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^i} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\right) $$\nUsing the anti-symmetry of the wedge product, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^i} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} = - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^i}$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\pi_r = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^r \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^i} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^i} \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^r \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^i} $$\nThis is the canonical form for a constant Poisson bivector of rank $2r$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The non-negative integer $r = \\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{rank}(\\pi)$ is the sole invariant, completely characterizing the structure up to linear equivalence. The number of such distinct structures corresponds to the possible values of $r$, which are $0, 1, \\dots, \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$.",
