            "problem": "Consider the real projective line $\\mathbb{RP}^{1}$, defined as the set of one-dimensional linear subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Using homogeneous coordinates, represent points of $\\mathbb{RP}^{1}$ by equivalence classes $[x:y]$ of nonzero vectors $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$ under the relation $(x,y) \\sim (\\lambda x, \\lambda y)$ for any $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is valid as it is a well-posed question in differential geometry, resting on standard, correct definitions and requiring a formal derivation.\n\nTo demonstrate that the two charts, $(U_{0}, \\varphi_{0})$ and $(U_{1}, \\varphi_{1})$, form a smoothly compatible atlas for the real projective line $\\mathbb{RP}^{1}$, we must first confirm they constitute an atlas and then verify that their transition function is smooth ($C^{\\infty}$).\n\nAn atlas on a topological space $M$ is a collection of charts $\\{(U_{\\alpha}, \\varphi_{\\alpha})\\}$ such that the sets $U_{\\alpha}$ form an open cover of $M$, and each $\\varphi_{\\alpha}$ is a homeomorphism from $U_{\\alpha}$ to an open subset of a Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. For the atlas to be smooth, all transition functions $\\varphi_{\\beta} \\circ \\varphi_{\\alpha}^{-1}$, defined on the open set $\\varphi_{\\alpha}(U_{\\alpha} \\cap U_{\\beta})$, must be smooth maps.\n\nFirst, we verify that $\\{U_{0}, U_{1}\\}$ is an open cover of $\\mathbb{RP}^{1}$. A point in $\\mathbb{RP}^{1}$ is an equivalence class $[x:y]$ where $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$. This means that at least one of $x$ or $y$ must be non-zero.\n- If $x \\neq 0$, the point $[x:y]$ belongs to $U_{0} = \\{[x:y] \\in \\mathbb{RP}^{1} \\mid x \\neq 0\\}$.\n- If $x = 0$, then it must be that $y \\neq 0$ (since $(x,y) \\neq (0,0)$), so the point $[x:y]$ belongs to $U_{1} = \\{[x:y] \\in \\mathbb{RP}^{1} \\mid y \\neq 0\\}$.\nSince every point in $\\mathbb{RP}^{1}$ must belong to at least one of these sets, we have $U_{0} \\cup U_{1} = \\mathbb{RP}^{1}$. The sets $U_{0}$ and $U_{1}$ are open in the quotient topology of $\\mathbb{RP}^{1}$, as they are the images of the open sets $\\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\} \\mid x \\neq 0\\}$ and $\\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\} \\mid y \\neq 0\\}$, respectively, under the quotient map $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\} \\to \\mathbb{RP}^{1}$. The maps $\\varphi_{0}$ and $\\varphi_{1}$ are homeomorphisms from their domains to $\\mathbb{R}$. Thus, $\\{(U_{0}, \\varphi_{0}), (U_{1}, \\varphi_{1})\\}$ constitutes an atlas for $\\mathbb{RP}^{1}$.\n\nNext, we establish smooth compatibility by computing the transition function $\\varphi_{1} \\circ \\varphi_{0}^{-1}$. This function maps the coordinate representation of a point from the chart $(U_{0}, \\varphi_{0})$ to its coordinate representation in the chart $(U_{1}, \\varphi_{1})$.\n\nThe domain of the transition function is the image of the overlap of the chart domains, $U_{0} \\cap U_{1}$, under the first chart map, $\\varphi_{0}$.\nThe overlap is $U_{0} \\cap U_{1} = \\{[x:y] \\in \\mathbb{RP}^{1} \\mid x \\neq 0 \\text{ and } y \\neq 0\\}$.\n\nThe image of this overlap under $\\varphi_{0}$ is:\n$$ \\varphi_{0}(U_{0} \\cap U_{1}) = \\{ \\varphi_{0}([x:y]) \\mid x \\neq 0, y \\neq 0 \\} = \\{ y/x \\mid x \\neq 0, y \\neq 0 \\} $$\nSince $y \\neq 0$, the ratio $y/x$ can be any real number except $0$. Thus, the domain of the transition function is $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$, which is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe range of the transition function is the image of the overlap under $\\varphi_{1}$:\n$$ \\varphi_{1}(U_{0} \\cap U_{1}) = \\{ \\varphi_{1}([x:y]) \\mid x \\neq 0, y \\neq 0 \\} = \\{ x/y \\mid x \\neq 0, y \\neq 0 \\} $$\nThis is also $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$, another open subset of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNow, we derive the explicit form of the transition function $\\varphi_{1} \\circ \\varphi_{0}^{-1}: \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. Let $u$ be a coordinate in the chart $(U_{0}, \\varphi_{0})$, so $u \\in \\varphi_{0}(U_{0} \\cap U_{1}) = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n\nBy definition, $u = \\varphi_{0}([x:y]) = y/x$ for some point $[x:y] \\in U_{0} \\cap U_{1}$.\nTo compute $(\\varphi_{1} \\circ \\varphi_{0}^{-1})(u)$, we must first find the point in $\\mathbb{RP}^{1}$ that corresponds to the coordinate $u$. This is given by the inverse map $\\varphi_{0}^{-1}$. We need to find $[x:y]$ such that $\\varphi_{0}([x:y]) = u$.\nFrom $u = y/x$, we can represent the equivalence class $[x:y]$ in many ways. A convenient choice is to set $x=1$. Since $[x:y] \\in U_{0}$, $x$ is non-zero, so this is a valid scaling. If $x=1$, then $u = y/1$, which implies $y=u$.\nSo, a representative for the point in $\\mathbb{RP}^{1}$ is $[1:u]$.\nTherefore, $\\varphi_{0}^{-1}(u) = [1:u]$.\nNote that for this point to be in the overlap $U_{0} \\cap U_{1}$, we must have both coordinates non-zero. The first coordinate is $1 \\neq 0$, so $[1:u] \\in U_{0}$ is guaranteed. The second coordinate is $u$. For the point to be in $U_{1}$, we require $u \\neq 0$. This is consistent with the domain of our transition map, $u \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n\nNext, we apply the map $\\varphi_{1}$ to this point:\n$$ \\varphi_{1}(\\varphi_{0}^{-1}(u)) = \\varphi_{1}([1:u]) $$\nThe map $\\varphi_{1}$ is defined as $\\varphi_{1}([x:y]) = x/y$. Applying this to the point $[1:u]$:\n$$ \\varphi_{1}([1:u]) = \\frac{1}{u} $$\nThus, the transition function is given by the expression:\n$$ (\\varphi_{1} \\circ \\varphi_{0}^{-1})(u) = \\frac{1}{u} $$\nThis function, $f(u) = 1/u$, is defined on the open set $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. It is infinitely differentiable ($C^{\\infty}$) for all $u \\neq 0$. For any integer $n \\ge 1$, its $n$-th derivative is $f^{(n)}(u) = (-1)^{n} n! u^{-(n+1)}$, which is well-defined on $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\nSimilarly, the inverse transition function $\\varphi_{0} \\circ \\varphi_{1}^{-1}$ is given by $(\\varphi_{0} \\circ \\varphi_{1}^{-1})(v) = 1/v$ for $v \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$, which is also $C^{\\infty}$.\nSince the transition function is smooth, the charts $(U_{0}, \\varphi_{0})$ and $(U_{1}, \\varphi_{1})$ are smoothly compatible, and they define a smooth $1$-dimensional manifold structure on $\\mathbb{RP}^{1}$.\n\nThe question asks for the explicit analytic expression for the transition function $\\varphi_{1} \\circ \\varphi_{0}^{-1}(u)$. Based on the derivation above, this expression is $1/u$.",

Let us denote its coordinate expression as:\n$$[X,Y] = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} Z^{k}(x) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{k}}$$\nOur first goal is to determine the component functions $Z^{k}(x)$. The components of a vector field $Z$ can be found by evaluating its action on the coordinate functions $x^{k}$, since $Z(x^{k}) = (\\sum_{j=1}^{n} Z^{j} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j}})(x^{k}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} Z^{j} \\frac{\\partial x^{k}}{\\partial x^{j}} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} Z^{j} \\delta_{j}^{k} = Z^{k}$.\nTherefore, the $k$-th component of $[X,Y]$ is given by $([X,Y])^{k} = [X,Y](x^{k})$.\n\nWe compute this using the definition of the Lie bracket:\n$$([X,Y])^{k} = [X,Y](x^{k}) = X(Y(x^{k})) - Y(X(x^{k}))$$\n\nFirst, we compute the inner terms.

The directional derivative of $F$ at $q$ in the direction $v$ is:\n$$\ndF_q(v) = \\left( \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} F_1(q+tv), \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} F_2(q+tv) \\right).\n$$\nFor the first component:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\sum_{i=1}^{4} m_i (q_i + tv_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} m_i v_i.\n$$\nFor the second component:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\sum_{i=1}^{4} m_i \\|q_i+tv_i\\|^2 = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\sum_{i=1}^{4} m_i (q_i \\cdot q_i + 2t q_i \\cdot v_i + t^2 v_i \\cdot v_i) = 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{4} m_i (q_i \\cdot v_i).\n$$\nSo, the derivative map $dF_q: T_q Q \\to \\mathbb{R}^3 \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is given by:\n$$\ndF_q(v) = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{4} m_i v_i, \\ 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{4} m_i (q_i \\cdot v_i) \\right).\n$$\nTo be surjective, for any $(w, s) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\times \\mathbb{R}$, there must exist a $v = (v_1, \\dots, v_4)$ such that $dF_q(v) = (w,s)$. Let us check when $dF_q$ is not surjective. This occurs if and only if the image of $dF_q$ is a proper subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^3 \\times \\mathbb{R}$. This is equivalent to the existence of a non-zero vector $(\\lambda, \\mu) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\times \\mathbb{R}$ that is orthogonal to the image of $dF_q$. Let $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ and $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The orthogonality condition is:\n$$\n\\lambda \\cdot \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{4} m_i v_i\\right) + \\mu \\left(2 \\sum_{i=1}^{4} m_i (q_i \\cdot v_i)\\right) = 0, \\quad \\text{for all } v=(v_1, \\dots, v_4).\n$$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{4} m_i (\\lambda + 2\\mu q_i) \\cdot v_i = 0.\n$$\nSince this must hold for any choice of $v_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ and since the masses $m_i$ are positive, this implies that for each $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$:\n$$\n\\lambda + 2\\mu q_i = 0.\n$$\nIf $\\mu=0$, the equation becomes $\\lambda=0$. This gives $(\\lambda, \\mu) = (0,0)$, which contradicts our assumption that $(\\lambda, \\mu)$ is non-zero. Thus, we must have $\\mu \\neq 0$.\nIf $\\mu \\neq 0$, then $q_i = -\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\mu}$ for all $i=1, 2, 3, 4$. This means all four position vectors are identical. Let's call this common vector $q_0$.\nNow we check if such a configuration $q = (q_0, q_0, q_0, q_0)$ can belong to the constraint set $C$. The conditions for $q \\in C$ are:\n1. $\\sum_{i=1}^{4} m_i q_i = 0$: Substituting $q_i=q_0$, we get $(\\sum_{i=1}^{4} m_i) q_0 = 0$. Since all $m_i > 0$, the total mass $M = \\sum m_i > 0$, which implies $q_0 = 0$.\n2. $\\sum_{i=1}^{4} m_i \\|q_i\\|^2 = I_0$: If $q_i = 0$ for all $i$, this becomes $\\sum m_i \\|0\\|^2 = 0$.\nSo, for such a configuration to be in $C$, we must have $I_0 = 0$. However, the problem states that $I_0 > 0$. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, for any $q \\in C$, the derivative $dF_q$ must be surjective. This means $c_0 = ((0,0,0), I_0)$ is a regular value of $F$. By the Regular Level Set Theorem, $C$ is a smooth submanifold of $Q$. Its dimension is:\n$$\n\\dim(C) = \\dim(Q) - \\dim(\\mathbb{R}^3 \\times \\mathbb{R}) = 12 - 4 = 8.\n$$\n\nStep 2: Identify $C^{\\ast} \\subset C$ and analyze the group action.\n\nThe group $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ acts on $Q$ by diagonal rotation: $R \\cdot q = (Rq_1, Rq_2, Rq_3, Rq_4)$. This action preserves the dot products and norms, so it preserves $F_2(q)$. It also preserves $F_1(q)$ since $\\sum m_i(Rq_i) = R(\\sum m_i q_i)$. Thus, if $q \\in C$, then $\\sum m_i q_i = 0$, so $R(\\sum m_i q_i) = R(0) = 0$, and the action preserves $C$.\n\nAn action is free if for any $q \\in C$, the stabilizer $G_q = \\{R \\in \\mathrm{SO}(3) \\mid R \\cdot q = q\\}$ is trivial, i.e., $G_q = \\{I\\}$. The condition $R \\cdot q = q$ means $Rq_i = q_i$ for all $i=1, 2, 3, 4$. A non-trivial rotation $R \\in \\mathrm{SO}(3)$ fixes a line (its axis of rotation). If $R$ is to fix all vectors $q_i$, then all non-zero $q_i$ must be collinear and lie on this axis. If all $q_i$ are collinear, say $q_i = c_i u$ for some scalars $c_i$ and a unit vector $u \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, then any rotation about the axis $u$ will fix all $q_i$. The stabilizer group would be isomorphic to $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$, which is not trivial. Conversely, if at least two of the vectors $q_i$ are linearly independent, they span a plane, and the only rotation fixing this plane pointwise is the identity. Thus, the action is not free precisely on the set of collinear configurations.\n\nLet $C_{\\text{sing}} \\subset C$ be the set of configurations where $q_1, q_2, q_3, q_4$ are all collinear. Let $C^{\\ast} = C \\setminus C_{\\text{sing}}$ be the set of non-collinear configurations. On $C^{\\ast}$, the action is free. The condition of collinearity can be expressed by the vanishing of certain continuous functions of the coordinates (e.g., all $2 \\times 2$ sub-determinants of the $3 \\times 4$ matrix $[q_1 \\, q_2 \\, q_3 \\, q_4]$), so $C_{\\text{sing}}$ is a closed subset of $C$. Consequently, $C^{\\ast}$ is an open subset of $C$, and thus is itself a smooth manifold of the same dimension, $\\dim(C^{\\ast}) = \\dim(C) = 8$.\n\nAn action of a Lie group $G$ on a manifold $M$ is proper if the map $\\Psi: G \\times M \\to M \\times M$, defined by $\\Psi(g,x)=(x, g \\cdot x)$, is a proper map (preimages of compact sets are compact). A standard result in Lie group theory is that if the group $G$ is compact, its continuous action on any Hausdorff space is proper. The space $C^{\\ast}$ is a submanifold of a Euclidean space, so it is Hausdorff. The special orthogonal group $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ is a closed and bounded subset of the space of $3 \\times 3$ matrices $\\mathbb{R}^9$, and is therefore compact by the Heine-Borel theorem. Thus, the action of $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ on $C^{\\ast}$ is proper.\n\nStep 3: Construct the reduced space and find its dimension.\n\nWe can now apply the Quotient Manifold Theorem, which states that if a Lie group $G$ acts smoothly, freely, and properly on a smooth manifold $M$, then the quotient space $M/G$ has the structure of a smooth manifold, and the dimension of $M/G$ is $\\dim(M) - \\dim(G)$.\nWe have established:\n- $G = \\mathrm{SO}(3)$ is a Lie group.\n- $M = C^{\\ast}$ is a smooth manifold.\n- The action of $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ on $C^{\\ast}$ is smooth (it is given by matrix multiplication, which is a smooth operation), free, and proper.\n\nTherefore, the reduced configuration space $M_{\\mathrm{red}} = C^{\\ast}/\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ is a smooth manifold. Its dimension is given by:\n$$\n\\dim(M_{\\mathrm{red}}) = \\dim(C^{\\ast}) - \\dim(\\mathrm{SO}(3)).\n$$\nWe have already found that $\\dim(C^{\\ast}) = 8$. The dimension of the Lie group $\\mathrm{SO}(n)$ is $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$. For $n=3$, the dimension of the rotation group $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ is:\n$$\n\\dim(\\mathrm{SO}(3)) = \\frac{3(3-1)}{2} = 3.\n$$\nThis corresponds to the $3$ degrees of freedom of a rotation in $3$D space (e.g., Euler angles).\n\nFinally, we compute the dimension of the reduced configuration space:\n$$\n\\dim(M_{\\mathrm{red}}) = 8 - 3 = 5.\n$$",
