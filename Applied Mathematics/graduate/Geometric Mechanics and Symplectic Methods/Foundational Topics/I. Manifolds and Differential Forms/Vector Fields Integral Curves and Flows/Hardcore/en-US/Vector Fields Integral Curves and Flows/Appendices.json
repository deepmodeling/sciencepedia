            "introduction": "To truly understand the dynamics generated by a vector field, we must study its integral curves. This first practice provides a concrete example by exploring one of the most fundamental types of motion: pure rotation. By analyzing a linear vector field defined by a skew-symmetric matrix, you will connect the algebraic properties of the field's generator to the geometric period of its circular flow, building essential intuition for the qualitative behavior of dynamical systems.

This exercise provides direct experience with this concept by tasking you with finding a parameter that makes a given function a first integral of a vector field. Successfully solving this problem requires applying the condition that the Lie derivative of the function along the vector field vanishes, $L_X F = 0$, reinforcing the link between vector field geometry and conservation laws.
