            "solution": "First, we derive the explicit formula for the inverse stereographic projection map $\\Phi(u,v)$.\nLet $(u,v)$ be coordinates in the projection plane $z=0$, so the point in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is $Q=(u,v,0)$. The projection is from the south pole $S=(0,0,-1)$. The point $\\Phi(u,v) = (x,y,z)$ lies on the line passing through $S$ and $Q$. We can parameterize this line by a parameter $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ as:\n$L(t) = S + t(Q-S) = (0,0,-1) + t((u,v,0) - (0,0,-1)) = (0,0,-1) + t(u,v,1)$.\nThe coordinates of a point on the line are thus $(tu, tv, t-1)$.\nThe point $\\Phi(u,v)$ is the intersection of this line with the unit sphere $S^2$, excluding the point $S$ itself. The coordinates of $\\Phi(u,v)$ must satisfy the equation of the sphere, $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$. Substituting the line parameterization into the sphere equation gives:\n$$(tu)^2 + (tv)^2 + (t-1)^2 = 1$$\n$$t^2 u^2 + t^2 v^2 + t^2 - 2t + 1 = 1$$\n$$t^2(u^2 + v^2 + 1) - 2t = 0$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $t$: $t(t(u^2+v^2+1) - 2) = 0$.\nThe solutions are $t=0$ and $t = \\frac{2}{u^2+v^2+1}$.\nThe solution $t=0$ corresponds to the point $L(0) = (0,0,0-1) = (0,0,-1)$, which is the south pole $S$. We are interested in the other intersection point.\nUsing $t = \\frac{2}{u^2+v^2+1}$, we find the coordinates of $\\Phi(u,v)=(x,y,z)$:\n$$x = tu = \\frac{2u}{1+u^2+v^2}$$\n$$y = tv = \\frac{2v}{1+u^2+v^2}$$\n$$z = t-1 = \\frac{2}{1+u^2+v^2} - 1 = \\frac{2 - (1+u^2+v^2)}{1+u^2+v^2} = \\frac{1-u^2-v^2}{1+u^2+v^2}$$\nThus, the inverse coordinate map is:\n$$\\Phi(u,v) = \\left( \\frac{2u}{1+u^2+v^2}, \\frac{2v}{1+u^2+v^2}, \\frac{1-u^2-v^2}{1+u^2+v^2} \\right)$$\n\nSecond, we compute the coordinate basis vectors of the tangent space $T_N S^2$ at the north pole $N=(0,0,1)$.\nFirst, we find the coordinates $(u,v)$ that map to $N$.\nSetting $\\Phi(u,v) = (0,0,1)$:\n$x = \\frac{2u}{1+u^2+v^2} = 0 \\implies u=0$.\n$y = \\frac{2v}{1+u^2+v^2} = 0 \\implies v=0$.\nChecking the $z$ coordinate: $z = \\frac{1-0^2-0^2}{1+0^2+0^2} = 1$.\nSo, the north pole $N$ corresponds to the point $(u,v)=(0,0)$ in the parameter domain.\n\nThe coordinate basis vectors, identified with their images in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, are the partial derivatives of $\\Phi(u,v)$ with respect to $u$ and $v$. We must compute $\\partial_u\\Phi(u,v)$ and $\\partial_v\\Phi(u,v)$ and then evaluate them at $(u,v)=(0,0)$.\nLet $D = 1+u^2+v^2$. The components of $\\Phi$ are $x = \\frac{2u}{D}$, $y = \\frac{2v}{D}$, $z = \\frac{1-u^2-v^2}{D}$.\nWe use the quotient rule for differentiation.\nFor the vector $\\partial_u\\Phi(u,v) = (\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial u}, \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u}, \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial u})$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial u} = \\frac{(2)(D) - (2u)(2u)}{D^2} = \\frac{2(1+u^2+v^2) - 4u^2}{(1+u^2+v^2)^2} = \\frac{2-2u^2+2v^2}{(1+u^2+v^2)^2}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u} = \\frac{(0)(D) - (2v)(2u)}{D^2} = \\frac{-4uv}{(1+u^2+v^2)^2}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial u} = \\frac{(-2u)(D) - (1-u^2-v^2)(2u)}{D^2} = \\frac{-2u(1+u^2+v^2) - 2u(1-u^2-v^2)}{(1+u^2+v^2)^2} = \\frac{-4u}{(1+u^2+v^2)^2}$$\nFor the vector $\\partial_v\\Phi(u,v) = (\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial v}, \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial v}, \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial v})$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial v} = \\frac{(0)(D) - (2u)(2v)}{D^2} = \\frac{-4uv}{(1+u^2+v^2)^2}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial v} = \\frac{(2)(D) - (2v)(2v)}{D^2} = \\frac{2(1+u^2+v^2) - 4v^2}{(1+u^2+v^2)^2} = \\frac{2+2u^2-2v^2}{(1+u^2+v^2)^2}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial v} = \\frac{(-2v)(D) - (1-u^2-v^2)(2v)}{D^2} = \\frac{-2v(1+u^2+v^2) - 2v(1-u^2-v^2)}{(1+u^2+v^2)^2} = \\frac{-4v}{(1+u^2+v^2)^2}$$\nNow, we evaluate these partial derivatives at $(u,v)=(0,0)$. The denominator $(1+u^2+v^2)^2$ becomes $(1+0+0)^2=1$.\nThe first basis vector is $\\partial_u\\Phi(0,0)$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial u}(0,0) = \\frac{2-0+0}{1} = 2$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial u}(0,0) = \\frac{0}{1} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial u}(0,0) = \\frac{0}{1} = 0$$\nSo, $\\partial_u\\Phi(0,0) = (2,0,0)$.\nThe second basis vector is $\\partial_v\\Phi(0,0)$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial v}(0,0) = \\frac{0}{1} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial v}(0,0) = \\frac{2+0-0}{1} = 2$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial v}(0,0) = \\frac{0}{1} = 0$$\nSo, $\\partial_v\\Phi(0,0) = (0,2,0)$.\n\nThird, we verify that these two vectors are orthogonal with respect to the standard Euclidean inner product in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. We compute their dot product:\n$$\\partial_u\\Phi(0,0) \\cdot \\partial_v\\Phi(0,0) = (2,0,0) \\cdot (0,2,0)$$\n$$= (2)(0) + (0)(2) + (0)(0) = 0$$\nSince their inner product is $0$, the vectors are orthogonal. This is expected, as stereographic projection is a conformal map, meaning it preserves angles. The orthogonal coordinate lines $u=const$ and $v=const$ in the $\\mathbb{R}^2$ plane are mapped to orthogonal curves on the sphere $S^2$.\n\nThe tangent space $T_N S^2$ at the north pole $N=(0,0,1)$ is the plane perpendicular to the normal vector at $N$. The normal vector is parallel to the position vector $N$ itself, so $T_N S^2$ is the plane defined by $z=1$. The vectors in this tangent space, when based at the origin, are of the form $(v_x, v_y, 0)$. Our computed basis vectors $(2,0,0)$ and $(0,2,0)$ lie in this space, which serves as a consistency check.",
