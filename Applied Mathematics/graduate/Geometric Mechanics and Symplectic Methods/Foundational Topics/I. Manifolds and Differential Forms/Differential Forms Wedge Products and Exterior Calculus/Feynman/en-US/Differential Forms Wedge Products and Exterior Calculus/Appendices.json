The derivation must proceed from first principles.\n\nThe phase space is $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$ with coordinates $(q_{1}, q_{2}, p_{1}, p_{2})$. The canonical tangent space basis is given by the set of partial derivative operators $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{1}}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{2}}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{1}}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{2}}\\}$.

The problem demands that we start from fundamental definitions. The alternating property of exterior forms is a direct consequence of the definition of the wedge product. Specifically, if we exchange the vector arguments:\n$$\n(\\theta \\wedge \\eta)(W, V) = \\theta(W)\\eta(V) - \\theta(V)\\eta(W) = -(\\theta(V)\\eta(W) - \\theta(W)\\eta(V)) = -(\\theta \\wedge \\eta)(V, W)\n$$\nThis demonstrates that any $2$-form constructed as a wedge product of two $1$-forms is inherently alternating. Since $\\alpha$ is a sum of such forms, it is also alternating. Applying this derived property, which comes from first principles, to our specific case:\n$$\n(\\mathrm{d}q_{1} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p_{1})(v_{2}, v_{1}) = \\mathrm{d}q_{1}(v_{2})\\mathrm{d}p_{1}(v_{1}) - \\mathrm{d}q_{1}(v_{1})\\mathrm{d}p_{1}(v_{2}) = (0)(0) - (1)(3) = -3\n$$\nThis is indeed the negative of $(\\mathrm{d}q_{1} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p_{1})(v_{1}, v_{2})$.\nAnd for the second term:\n$$\n(\\mathrm{d}q_{2} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p_{2})(v_{2}, v_{1}) = \\mathrm{d}q_{2}(v_{2})\\mathrm{d}p_{2}(v_{1}) - \\mathrm{d}q_{2}(v_{1})\\mathrm{d}p_{2}(v_{2}) = (1)(2) - (0)(0) = 2\n$$\nThis is the negative of $(\\mathrm{d}q_{2} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p_{2})(v_{1}, v_{2})$.\nBy bilinearity, we sum these results to find $\\alpha(v_{2}, v_{1})$:\n$$\n\\alpha(v_{2}, v_{1}) = (\\mathrm{d}q_{1} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p_{1})(v_{2}, v_{1}) + (\\mathrm{d}q_{2} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p_{2})(v_{2}, v_{1}) = -3 + 2 = -1\n$$\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\alpha(v_{2},v_{1})}{\\alpha(v_{1},v_{2})} = \\frac{-1}{1} = -1\n$$\nThis result rigorously confirms the alternating property of the $2$-form $\\alpha$ for the given vectors.",

The columns of this matrix are the coordinate vectors of the images of the basis vectors.\n\nFirst, we compute the image of the basis vector $\\partial_{q}$:\n$$\n\\omega^{\\sharp}(\\partial_{q}) = \\iota_{\\partial_{q}}\\omega = \\iota_{\\partial_{q}}(a(q,p)\\,dq\\wedge dp) = a(q,p)\\,\\iota_{\\partial_{q}}(dq\\wedge dp)\n$$\nThe interior product acts on a wedge product of $1$-forms as follows: $\\iota_{v}(\\eta \\wedge \\xi) = (\\iota_{v}\\eta)\\xi - \\eta(\\iota_{v}\\xi)$. Using the definition $\\iota_{v}\\eta = \\eta(v)$:\n$$\n\\iota_{\\partial_{q}}(dq\\wedge dp) = (\\iota_{\\partial_{q}}dq)dp - dq(\\iota_{\\partial_{q}}dp) = dq(\\partial_{q})dp - dq(dp(\\partial_{q}))\n$$\nBy duality of the coordinate bases, $dq(\\partial_{q})=1$, $dq(\\partial_{p})=0$, $dp(\\partial_{q})=0$, and $dp(\\partial_{p})=1$.\n$$\n\\iota_{\\partial_{q}}(dq\\wedge dp) = (1)dp - dq(0) = dp\n$$\nThus, the image of $\\partial_{q}$ is:\n$$\n\\omega^{\\sharp}(\\partial_{q}) = a(q,p)\\,dp = 0 \\cdot dq + a(q,p) \\cdot dp\n$$\nThe coordinate vector for this in the basis $\\{dq, dp\\}$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ a(q,p) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nNext, we compute the image of the basis vector $\\partial_{p}$:\n$$\n\\omega^{\\sharp}(\\partial_{p}) = \\iota_{\\partial_{p}}\\omega = \\iota_{\\partial_{p}}(a(q,p)\\,dq\\wedge dp) = a(q,p)\\,\\iota_{\\partial_{p}}(dq\\wedge dp)\n$$\n$$\n\\iota_{\\partial_{p}}(dq\\wedge dp) = (\\iota_{\\partial_{p}}dq)dp - dq(\\iota_{\\partial_{p}}dp) = dq(\\partial_{p})dp - dq(dp(\\partial_{p}))\n$$\n$$\n\\iota_{\\partial_{p}}(dq\\wedge dp) = (0)dp - dq(1) = -dq\n$$\nThus, the image of $\\partial_{p}$ is:\n$$\n\\omega^{\\sharp}(\\partial_{p}) = -a(q,p)\\,dq = -a(q,p) \\cdot dq + 0 \\cdot dp\n$$\nThe coordinate vector for this in the basis $\\{dq, dp\\}$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} -a(q,p) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe matrix of $\\omega^{\\sharp}$ with respect to the given bases is formed by these column vectors:\n$$\n[\\omega^{\\sharp}] = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -a(q,p) \\\\ a(q,p) & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n$$\n\\det(\\omega^{\\sharp}) = (0)(0) - (-a(q,p))(a(q,p)) = (a(q,p))^{2}\n$$\n\n**3. Condition for $\\omega$ to be Symplectic**\n\nA $2$-form is symplectic if and only if it is closed and nondegenerate.\n\n- **Closedness**: From part 1, we established that $d\\omega = 0$ for any smooth function $a(q,p)$. Therefore, $\\omega$ is always closed.\n\n- **Nondegeneracy**: For a $2$-form on a $2$-manifold, nondegeneracy is equivalent to the form being nowhere-vanishing. The form is $\\omega = a(q,p) \\, dq \\wedge dp$. The basis $2$-form $dq \\wedge dp$ constitutes a volume form on $T^2$ and is nowhere zero. Therefore, $\\omega$ is nowhere zero if and only if its coefficient function $a(q,p)$ is nowhere zero. So, the condition is $a(q,p) \\neq 0$ for all $(q,p) \\in T^{2}$.\n\nThis conclusion is consistent with the general definition of nondegeneracy, which requires the map $\\omega^{\\sharp}: TM \\to T^{*}M$ to be an isomorphism at every point. This is true if and only if its matrix representation is invertible, which in turn requires its determinant to be non-zero. From part 2, $\\det(\\omega^{\\sharp}) = (a(q,p))^{2}$. The condition $\\det(\\omega^{\\sharp}) \\neq 0$ means $(a(q,p))^{2} \\neq 0$, which is equivalent to $a(q,p) \\neq 0$.\n\nThus, the necessary and sufficient condition for $\\omega$ to be a symplectic form is that the function $a(q,p)$ is nowhere vanishing on the torus $T^{2}$.\n\nThe final answer requested is the expression for the determinant.",
