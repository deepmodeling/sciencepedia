            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound. We proceed with the solution in several steps.\n\nFirst, we derive the condition that characterizes the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{sl}(2,\\mathbb{R})$ as a subspace of the space of all real $2 \\times 2$ matrices, $M_{2}(\\mathbb{R})$. The Lie group is $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$, the set of $2 \\times 2$ real matrices with determinant equal to $1$.

The elements of this tangent space, denoted by $X$, are the tangent vectors to curves in the group that pass through the identity. Let $A(t)$ be such a curve, representing a one-parameter subgroup, with $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ being the parameter. We have $A(0) = I$, and the tangent vector at the identity is $X = \\frac{d A(t)}{dt}\\big|_{t=0}$.\n\nFor any $t$, the matrix $A(t)$ is in $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$, which means its determinant is constant and equal to $1$:\n$$ \\det(A(t)) = 1 $$\nWe differentiate this condition with respect to $t$ and evaluate at $t=0$. The derivative of a constant is zero, so:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\det(A(t))\\bigg|_{t=0} = 0 $$\nTo evaluate the left-hand side, we use Jacobi's formula for the derivative of the determinant of a matrix $A(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\det(A(t)) = \\det(A(t)) \\,\\mathrm{tr}\\left(A(t)^{-1} \\frac{dA(t)}{dt}\\right) $$\nNow, we evaluate this expression at $t=0$. We use the facts that $A(0)=I$, $\\det(A(0))=1$, and $\\frac{dA(t)}{dt}\\big|_{t=0} = X$.\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\det(A(t))\\bigg|_{t=0} = \\det(A(0)) \\,\\mathrm{tr}\\left(A(0)^{-1} \\frac{dA(t)}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0}\\right) = 1 \\cdot \\mathrm{tr}\\left(I^{-1} X\\right) = \\mathrm{tr}(X) $$\nEquating this with our earlier result, we find the condition for any matrix $X$ to be in $\\mathfrak{sl}(2,\\mathbb{R})$:\n$$ \\mathrm{tr}(X) = 0 $$\nThus, $\\mathfrak{sl}(2,\\mathbb{R})$ is the vector space of all $2 \\times 2$ real matrices with a trace of zero.\n\nNext, we are given a basis $\\{H, E, F\\}$ for $\\mathfrak{sl}(2,\\mathbb{R})$:\n$$ H=\\begin{pmatrix}1  0 \\\\ 0  -1\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad E=\\begin{pmatrix}0  1 \\\\ 0  0\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad F=\\begin{pmatrix}0  0 \\\\ 1  0\\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe can verify that these matrices are indeed in $\\mathfrak{sl}(2,\\mathbb{R})$ by checking their traces:\n$\\mathrm{tr}(H) = 1 + (-1) = 0$\n$\\mathrm{tr}(E) = 0 + 0 = 0$\n$\\mathrm{tr}(F) = 0 + 0 = 0$\nAll traces are zero, as required.\n\nNow we compute the Lie brackets using the commutator definition $[X,Y] = XY - YX$.\n\n1.
