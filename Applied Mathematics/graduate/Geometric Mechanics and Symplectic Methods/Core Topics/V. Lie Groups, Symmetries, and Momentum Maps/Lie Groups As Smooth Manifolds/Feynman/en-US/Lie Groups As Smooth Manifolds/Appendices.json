The problem is scientifically and mathematically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed.

If $v$ is represented as the velocity of a curve $\\gamma(t)$ with $\\gamma(0)=p$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}(0)=v$, then its image under the differential is given by the velocity of the composite curve $f \\circ \\gamma$ at $t=0$:\n$$ Df_p(v) = \\frac{d}{dt}(f(\\gamma(t)))|_{t=0} $$\n\nWe apply this definition to the inversion map $\\iota(g) = g^{-1}$.\n\n**1. Computation of $D\\iota_{I}(X)$**\nLet $X \\in \\mathfrak{g} = T_I G$. By definition, there exists a smooth curve $\\gamma: (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon) \\to G$ such that $\\gamma(0)=I$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}(0)=X$. The differential $D\\iota_I$ maps from $T_I G$ to $T_{\\iota(I)}G = T_{I^{-1}}G = T_I G$. Applying the definition of the differential to the vector $X$:\n$$ D\\iota_I(X) = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\iota(\\gamma(t)))|_{t=0} = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\gamma(t)^{-1})|_{t=0} $$\nTo find the derivative of the inverse map, we use the provided identity $\\gamma(t)\\gamma(t)^{-1} = I$.

We represent $V$ as the velocity of a smooth curve $g(t)$ in $G$ with $g(0)=g$ and $\\dot{g}(0)=V$. The differential $D\\iota_g$ is a linear map from $T_g G$ to $T_{\\iota(g)}G = T_{g^{-1}}G$. We compute its action on $V$:\n$$ D\\iota_g(V) = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\iota(g(t)))|_{t=0} = \\frac{d}{dt}(g(t)^{-1})|_{t=0} $$\nWe use the same general formula for the derivative of a matrix inverse derived in the first part, but applied to the curve $g(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}(g(t)^{-1}) = -g(t)^{-1}\\dot{g}(t)g(t)^{-1} $$\nEvaluating at $t=0$:\n$$ D\\iota_g(V) = - g(0)^{-1} \\dot{g}(0) g(0)^{-1} $$\nSubstituting the curve properties $g(0)=g$ and $\\dot{g}(0)=V$:\n$$ D\\iota_g(V) = - g^{-1} V g^{-1} $$\nThis is the expression for the differential of the inversion map at an arbitrary point $g \\in G$.

Thus, we have the matrix identity:\n$$ \\Omega^2 = \\omega \\otimes \\omega - \\theta^2 I $$\n\nNext, we compute the third power, $\\Omega^3$:\n$$ \\Omega^3 = \\Omega \\Omega^2 = \\widehat{\\omega}(\\omega \\otimes \\omega - \\theta^2 I) $$\nApplying this to a vector $v$:\n$$ \\Omega^3 v = \\omega \\times ((\\omega \\otimes \\omega)v - \\theta^2 v) = \\omega \\times (\\omega(\\omega \\cdot v)) - \\theta^2(\\omega \\times v) $$\nThe first term $\\omega \\times (\\omega(\\omega \\cdot v))$ is zero, since $\\omega$ is parallel to the vector $\\omega(\\omega \\cdot v)$. The second term is $-\\theta^2 \\Omega v$.\n$$ \\Omega^3 v = -\\theta^2 \\Omega v $$\nSince this holds for all $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, we have the crucial recurrence relation for the matrix powers:\n$$ \\Omega^3 = -\\theta^2 \\Omega $$\n\nUsing this relation, we can express all higher powers of $\\Omega$ in terms of $\\Omega$ and $\\Omega^2$:\n$$ \\Omega^4 = \\Omega(\\Omega^3) = \\Omega(-\\theta^2 \\Omega) = -\\theta^2 \\Omega^2 $$\n$$ \\Omega^5 = \\Omega(\\Omega^4) = \\Omega(-\\theta^2 \\Omega^2) = -\\theta^2 \\Omega^3 = -\\theta^2(-\\theta^2 \\Omega) = \\theta^4 \\Omega $$\nThe general pattern for $k \\ge 1$ is:\n$$ \\Omega^{2k-1} = (-1)^{k-1} \\theta^{2(k-1)} \\Omega $$\n$$ \\Omega^{2k} = (-1)^{k-1} \\theta^{2(k-1)} \\Omega^2 $$\n\nNow, we substitute these into the series for $\\exp(\\Omega)$:\n$$ \\exp(\\Omega) = I + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\Omega^k}{k!} $$\nWe split the sum into odd and even powers:\n$$ \\exp(\\Omega) = I + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\Omega^{2k-1}}{(2k-1)!} + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\Omega^{2k}}{(2k)!} $$\nSubstituting the recurrence relations:\n$$ \\exp(\\Omega) = I + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^{k-1} \\theta^{2(k-1)}}{(2k-1)!} \\Omega + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^{k-1} \\theta^{2(k-1)}}{(2k)!} \\Omega^2 $$\nLet's analyze the coefficient series for $\\Omega$ and $\\Omega^2$.\nFor the term with $\\Omega$:\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^{k-1} \\theta^{2(k-1)}}{(2k-1)!} = 1 - \\frac{\\theta^2}{3!} + \\frac{\\theta^4}{5!} - \\dots $$\nThis is the Taylor series for $\\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\theta}$.\nFor the term with $\\Omega^2$:\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^{k-1} \\theta^{2(k-1)}}{(2k)!} = \\frac{1}{2!} - \\frac{\\theta^2}{4!} + \\frac{\\theta^4}{6!} - \\dots $$\nThis series is related to the cosine series. We can write it as:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\theta^2} \\left( \\frac{\\theta^2}{2!} - \\frac{\\theta^4}{4!} + \\frac{\\theta^6}{6!} - \\dots \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\theta^2} \\left( 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{\\theta^2}{2!} + \\frac{\\theta^4}{4!} - \\dots \\right) \\right) = \\frac{1 - \\cos(\\theta)}{\\theta^2} $$\nCombining these results, we obtain the closed-form expression for $\\exp(\\Omega)$:\n$$ \\exp(\\Omega) = I + \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\theta} \\Omega + \\frac{1 - \\cos(\\theta)}{\\theta^2} \\Omega^2 $$\nThis is the celebrated Rodrigues' rotation formula in matrix form.\n\nNext, we verify the axis-angle interpretation.\nLet $u = \\omega / \\|\\omega\\| = \\omega / \\theta$ be the unit vector along the axis of rotation.\nWe must show that $\\exp(\\Omega)$ fixes the axis $u$, i.e., $\\exp(\\Omega) u = u$.\nWe apply $\\Omega$ to $u$:\n$$ \\Omega u = \\widehat{\\omega} u = \\omega \\times u = (\\theta u) \\times u = 0 $$\nSince $\\Omega u = 0$, it follows that $\\Omega^k u = 0$ for all $k \\ge 1$.\nTherefore, applying the closed-form expression for $\\exp(\\Omega)$ to $u$:\n$$ \\exp(\\Omega) u = \\left(I + \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\theta} \\Omega + \\frac{1 - \\cos(\\theta)}{\\theta^2} \\Omega^2 \\right) u = I u + 0 + 0 = u $$\nThe axis $u$ is indeed fixed by the transformation.\n\nNow, we demonstrate the standard action on any vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. We apply $\\exp(\\Omega)$ to $v$:\n$$ \\exp(\\Omega) v = v + \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\theta} (\\Omega v) + \\frac{1 - \\cos(\\theta)}{\\theta^2} (\\Omega^2 v) $$\nWe substitute the expressions for $\\Omega v$ and $\\Omega^2 v$:\n$$ \\Omega v = \\omega \\times v = (\\theta u) \\times v = \\theta (u \\times v) $$\n$$ \\Omega^2 v = \\omega \\times (\\omega \\times v) = \\theta^2 (u \\times (u \\times v)) = \\theta^2 (u(u \\cdot v) - v) $$\nPlugging these into the expression for $\\exp(\\Omega) v$:\n$$ \\exp(\\Omega) v = v + \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\theta} (\\theta(u \\times v)) + \\frac{1 - \\cos(\\theta)}{\\theta^2} (\\theta^2 (u(u \\cdot v) - v)) $$\n$$ \\exp(\\Omega) v = v + \\sin(\\theta)(u \\times v) + (1 - \\cos(\\theta))(u(u \\cdot v) - v) $$\nGrouping the terms containing $v$:\n$$ \\exp(\\Omega) v = (1 - (1 - \\cos(\\theta)))v + \\sin(\\theta)(u \\times v) + (1 - \\cos(\\theta))u(u \\cdot v) $$\n$$ \\exp(\\Omega) v = \\cos(\\theta)v + \\sin(\\theta)(u \\times v) + (1 - \\cos(\\theta))u(u \\cdot v) $$\nThis is exactly the Rodrigues' formula for rotating a vector $v$ by an angle $\\theta$ about a unit axis $u$.\n\nFinally, we conclude that $\\exp(\\Omega) \\in \\mathrm{SO}(3)$.\nFor any $\\Omega \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$, we have $\\Omega^T = -\\Omega$. The transpose of the matrix exponential is:\n$$ (\\exp(\\Omega))^T = \\exp(\\Omega^T) = \\exp(-\\Omega) $$\nSince $\\Omega$ and $-\\Omega$ commute, we have:\n$$ (\\exp(\\Omega))^T \\exp(\\Omega) = \\exp(-\\Omega) \\exp(\\Omega) = \\exp(-\\Omega + \\Omega) = \\exp(0) = I $$\nThis demonstrates that $\\exp(\\Omega)$ is an orthogonal matrix.\nFurthermore, using Jacobi's formula, $\\det(\\exp(\\Omega)) = \\exp(\\mathrm{tr}(\\Omega))$. Since $\\Omega$ is a skew-symmetric matrix, its diagonal elements are all zero, so its trace is zero, $\\mathrm{tr}(\\Omega) = 0$.\nThus, $\\det(\\exp(\\Omega)) = \\exp(0) = 1$.\nAn orthogonal matrix with determinant $1$ is an element of the special orthogonal group $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$. The action of $\\exp(\\Omega)$ on any vector $v$ is a rotation by angle $\\theta = \\|\\omega\\|$ about an axis $u = \\omega/\\|\\omega\\|$, and this rotation is unique.\nTherefore, $\\exp(\\Omega)$ is the unique rotation matrix in $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ corresponding to this rotation.",
