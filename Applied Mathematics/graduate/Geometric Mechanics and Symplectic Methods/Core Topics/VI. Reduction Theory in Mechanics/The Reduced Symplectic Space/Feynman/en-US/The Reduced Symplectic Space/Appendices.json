Let the additive Lie group $\\mathbb{R}$ act on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ by simultaneous translations of the first two configuration coordinates, defined by $t\\cdot(q_{1},q_{2},q_{3},\\dots,q_{n},p_{1},\\dots,p_{n})=(q_{1}+t,q_{2}+t,q_{3},\\dots,q_{n},p_{1},\\dots,p_{n})$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is a well-posed problem in symplectic geometry, scientifically grounded in the established theory of Hamiltonian mechanics and symplectic reduction. The definitions, conditions, and objectives are clear, consistent, and mathematically rigorous.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Momentum Map\n\nThe momentum map $J:\\mathbb{R}^{2n}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is defined by the relation $dJ=\\iota_{X}\\omega_{0}$, where $\\iota_{X}$ denotes the interior product, $X$ is the infinitesimal generator of the group action, and $\\omega_{0}$ is the canonical symplectic form.\n\nThe given generator is the vector field $X=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{1}}+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{2}}$.\nThe canonical symplectic form is $\\omega_{0}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}dq_{i}\\wedge dp_{i}$.\n\nWe compute the interior product $\\iota_{X}\\omega_{0}$:\n$$\n\\iota_{X}\\omega_{0} = \\iota_{\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{1}}+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{2}}\\right)}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}dq_{i}\\wedge dp_{i}\\right)\n$$\nBy linearity of the interior product, this becomes:\n$$\n\\iota_{X}\\omega_{0} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{1}}}(dq_{i}\\wedge dp_{i}) + \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{2}}}(dq_{i}\\wedge dp_{i})\n$$\nThe interior product of a vector field $V$ with a wedge product of two $1$-forms $A$ and $B$ is given by $\\iota_{V}(A\\wedge B) = A(V)B - B(V)A$.\nFor the vector field $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{k}}$ and the $2$-form $dq_{i}\\wedge dp_{i}$, we have:\n$$\n\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{k}}}(dq_{i}\\wedge dp_{i}) = dq_{i}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{k}}\\right)dp_{i} - dp_{i}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{k}}\\right)dq_{i}\n$$\nSince $dq_{i}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{k}}) = \\delta_{ik}$ (the Kronecker delta) and $dp_{i}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{k}}) = 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{k}}}(dq_{i}\\wedge dp_{i}) = \\delta_{ik}dp_{i} - 0 \\cdot dq_{i} = \\delta_{ik}dp_{i}\n$$\nApplying this to our calculation:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{1}}}(dq_{i}\\wedge dp_{i}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\delta_{i1}dp_{i} = dp_{1}\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\iota_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{2}}}(dq_{i}\\wedge dp_{i}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\delta_{i2}dp_{i} = dp_{2}\n$$\nThus, the condition for the momentum map becomes:\n$$\ndJ = dp_{1} + dp_{2}\n$$\nThe exterior derivative of a function $J$ is $dJ = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial q_{i}}dq_{i} + \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial p_{i}}dp_{i}$. Comparing coefficients with $dJ = dp_1+dp_2$, we find that $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial p_{1}}=1$, $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial p_{2}}=1$, and all other partial derivatives are zero. Integrating these relations yields:\n$$\nJ(q_{1},\\dots,q_{n},p_{1},\\dots,p_{n}) = p_{1}+p_{2}+C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. A momentum map is defined up to an additive constant, so we can choose $C=0$ for simplicity. The momentum map is $J=p_{1}+p_{2}$.\n\n### Part 2: Verification of the Existence of a Reduced Symplectic Form\n\nLet $P = J^{-1}(0)$ be the level set, $i: P \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ be the inclusion map, and $\\pi: P \\to M_{\\mathrm{red}} = P/\\mathbb{R}$ be the quotient projection. A symplectic form $\\omega_{\\mathrm{red}}$ is well-defined on $M_{\\mathrm{red}}$ if it satisfies $\\pi^{*}\\omega_{\\mathrm{red}} = i^{*}\\omega_{0}$ and is non-degenerate. This requires two conditions on the restricted form $i^*\\omega_0$:\n1. $i^*\\omega_0$ must be a basic form with respect to the projection $\\pi$. This means it must be invariant under the action ($\\mathcal{L}_{X}(i^{*}\\omega_{0})=0$) and its kernel must contain the vertical vectors (tangents to the fibers of $\\pi$).\n2. The kernel of $i^{*}\\omega_{0}$ must be precisely the space of vertical vectors.\n\nLet's verify these conditions. The vertical vectors are spanned by the generator $X$.\n\nFirst, we check invariance. The Lie derivative of $\\omega_{0}$ along $X$ is given by Cartan's formula: $\\mathcal{L}_{X}\\omega_{0} = d(\\iota_{X}\\omega_{0}) + \\iota_{X}(d\\omega_{0})$.\nSince $\\omega_{0}$ is a symplectic form, it is closed, so $d\\omega_{0}=0$. From Part 1, we have $\\iota_{X}\\omega_{0} = dJ$.\nTherefore, $\\mathcal{L}_{X}\\omega_{0} = d(dJ) = 0$, as the exterior derivative applied twice is always zero.\nThe invariance of $\\omega_0$ under the flow of $X$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ implies the invariance of its restriction $i^{*}\\omega_{0}$ under the action on $P$.\n\nNext, we identify the kernel of the restricted form $i^{*}\\omega_{0}$ on the tangent space $T_{z}P$ for any point $z \\in P$.\nA vector $v$ is in $T_{z}P$ if and only if $dJ_{z}(v)=0$.\nThe action is Hamiltonian, with $J$ being the Hamiltonian function, meaning $X$ is the Hamiltonian vector field associated with $J$. This is confirmed by our calculation: $\\iota_{X}\\omega_{0} = dJ$.\nSo, a vector $v \\in T_{z}\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ is tangent to $P$ at $z$ if $dJ_z(v) = (\\iota_{X}\\omega_{0})_z(v) = \\omega_{0}(X_z, v) = 0$.\nThis means $T_{z}P$ is the symplectic orthogonal complement of the subspace spanned by $X_z$, i.e., $T_{z}P = (\\mathrm{span}(X_z))^{\\omega}$.\n\nThe kernel of the restricted form $(i^{*}\\omega_{0})_{z}$ consists of vectors $v \\in T_{z}P$ such that for all $w \\in T_{z}P$, we have $(i^{*}\\omega_{0})_{z}(v,w) = \\omega_{0}(v,w) = 0$.\nThis means the kernel is the symplectic orthogonal of $T_zP$: $\\ker((i^{*}\\omega_{0})_{z}) = (T_zP)^{\\omega}$.\nSubstituting $T_{z}P = (\\mathrm{span}(X_z))^{\\omega}$, we get:\n$$\n\\ker((i^{*}\\omega_{0})_{z}) = ((\\mathrm{span}(X_z))^{\\omega})^{\\omega}\n$$\nSince $\\omega_{0}$ is non-degenerate, for any subspace $W$, $(W^{\\omega})^{\\omega}=W$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\ker((i^{*}\\omega_{0})_{z}) = \\mathrm{span}(X_z)\n$$\nThe kernel of the restricted form at each point is precisely the one-dimensional space spanned by the generator $X$, which is the tangent space to the fiber of the projection $\\pi$. This proves that $i^{*}\\omega_{0}$ descends to a non-degenerate form $\\omega_{\\mathrm{red}}$ on the quotient space $M_{\\mathrm{red}}$.\nFinally, since $d\\omega_0=0$, its pullback $i^*\\omega_0$ is also closed: $d(i^*\\omega_0) = i^*(d\\omega_0)=0$. As the exterior derivative commutes with the projection $\\pi$, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{red}}$ is also closed. Thus, $M_{\\mathrm{red}}$ inherits a symplectic structure.\n\n### Part 3: Explicit Computation of the Reduced Symplectic Form\n\nWe introduce the specified linear change of variables for the first two pairs of coordinates:\n$$\nq_{+}=\\frac{q_{1}+q_{2}}{\\sqrt{2}},\\quad q_{-}=\\frac{q_{1}-q_{2}}{\\sqrt{2}},\\quad p_{+}=\\frac{p_{1}+p_{2}}{\\sqrt{2}},\\quad p_{-}=\\frac{p_{1}-p_{2}}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nThe inverse transformation is:\n$$\nq_{1}=\\frac{q_{+}+q_{-}}{\\sqrt{2}},\\quad q_{2}=\\frac{q_{+}-q_{-}}{\\sqrt{2}},\\quad p_{1}=\\frac{p_{+}+p_{-}}{\\sqrt{2}},\\quad p_{2}=\\frac{p_{+}-p_{-}}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nWe express the differentials $dq_1, dp_1, dq_2, dp_2$ in terms of the new coordinates' differentials and substitute them into the symplectic form $\\omega_{0}$. The part of $\\omega_0$ involving the first two pairs of coordinates is $dq_{1}\\wedge dp_{1} + dq_{2}\\wedge dp_{2}$.\n$$\ndq_{1}\\wedge dp_{1} = \\frac{1}{2}(dq_{+}+dq_{-})\\wedge(dp_{+}+dp_{-}) = \\frac{1}{2}(dq_{+}\\wedge dp_{+} + dq_{+}\\wedge dp_{-} + dq_{-}\\wedge dp_{+} + dq_{-}\\wedge dp_{-})\n$$\n$$\ndq_{2}\\wedge dp_{2} = \\frac{1}{2}(dq_{+}-dq_{-})\\wedge(dp_{+}-dp_{-}) = \\frac{1}{2}(dq_{+}\\wedge dp_{+} - dq_{+}\\wedge dp_{-} - dq_{-}\\wedge dp_{+} + dq_{-}\\wedge dp_{-})\n$$\nAdding these two expressions, the cross terms cancel out:\n$$\ndq_{1}\\wedge dp_{1} + dq_{2}\\wedge dp_{2} = dq_{+}\\wedge dp_{+} + dq_{-}\\wedge dp_{-}\n$$\nSo, the full symplectic form in the new coordinates is:\n$$\n\\omega_{0} = dq_{+}\\wedge dp_{+} + dq_{-}\\wedge dp_{-} + \\sum_{i=3}^{n}dq_{i}\\wedge dp_{i}\n$$\nThe momentum map $J=p_{1}+p_{2}$ becomes $J=\\sqrt{2}p_{+}$. The level set $J^{-1}(0)$ is defined by the constraint $p_{+}=0$.\nWe now restrict $\\omega_{0}$ to the level set $J^{-1}(0)$. Any vector $v$ tangent to $J^{-1}(0)$ must satisfy $dJ(v)=0$, which implies $\\sqrt{2}dp_{+}(v)=0$, so $dp_{+}(v)=0$. For any two tangent vectors $v_{1}, v_{2} \\in T(J^{-1}(0))$, the term $dq_{+}\\wedge dp_{+}$ evaluates to:\n$$\n(dq_{+}\\wedge dp_{+})(v_{1}, v_{2}) = dq_{+}(v_{1})dp_{+}(v_{2}) - dq_{+}(v_{2})dp_{+}(v_{1}) = dq_{+}(v_{1})\\cdot 0 - dq_{+}(v_{2})\\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the restriction of $\\omega_0$ to the tangent bundle of $J^{-1}(0)$ is:\n$$\ni^{*}\\omega_{0} = dq_{-}\\wedge dp_{-} + \\sum_{i=3}^{n}dq_{i}\\wedge dp_{i}\n$$\nThe $\\mathbb{R}$-action on the original coordinates $t\\cdot(q_1,q_2)=(q_1+t, q_2+t)$ translates in the new coordinates to $q_+\\mapsto q_+ + \\sqrt{2}t$ and $q_-\\mapsto q_-$. The reduced space $M_{\\mathrm{red}}=J^{-1}(0)/\\mathbb{R}$ is formed by quotienting out the action, which corresponds to translations in the $q_{+}$ direction. On this quotient space, the coordinate $q_{+}$ is eliminated. The coordinates for $M_{\\mathrm{red}}$ are $(q_{-},p_{-},q_{3},\\dots,q_{n},p_{3},\\dots,p_{n})$.\n\nThe form $i^{*}\\omega_{0}$ depends only on these coordinates and their differentials. It is independent of the fiber coordinate $q_{+}$. Therefore, the form descends directly to the quotient, and the reduced symplectic form $\\omega_{\\mathrm{red}}$ has the same expression as $i^{*}\\omega_{0}$, but interpreted on $M_{\\mathrm{red}}$:\n$$\n\\omega_{\\mathrm{red}} = dq_{-}\\wedge dp_{-} + \\sum_{i=3}^{n}dq_{i}\\wedge dp_{i}\n$$\nThis expression is in terms of the coordinates on the reduced space as required. This is the canonical symplectic form on a space of dimension $2(n-1)$, which in this case can be identified with $\\mathbb{R}^{2(n-1)}$.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the cone angle at the singular point of the reduced symplectic space $M_{\\mathrm{red}} = \\mu^{-1}(c)/S^{1}$ for $c>0$. To solve this, we must first determine the moment map $\\mu$, then analyze the structure of the quotient space.\n\nFirst, we determine the moment map $\\mu:\\mathbb{C}^{2}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ from the defining relation $d\\mu=\\iota_{X}\\omega$. There are sign conventions associated with this definition. A common convention, which we will adopt, defines the infinitesimal generator $X$ of the $S^1$ action $\\phi_{\\theta}(z_1, z_2) = (\\mathrm{e}^{\\sqrt{-1}\\theta}z_1, \\mathrm{e}^{\\sqrt{-1}m\\theta}z_2)$ as $X|_{(z_1,z_2)} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\big|_{t=0} \\phi_{-t}(z_1, z_2)$. This choice leads to a moment map whose level sets for positive energy are compact.\nLet $z_k=x_k+\\sqrt{-1}y_k$ for $k=1,2$. The action corresponds to rotations in the $(x_k, y_k)$ planes.\nFor $(z_1)$, the action is $\\mathrm{e}^{-\\sqrt{-1}t}(x_1+\\sqrt{-1}y_1) = (\\cos t - \\sqrt{-1}\\sin t)(x_1+\\sqrt{-1}y_1) = (x_1\\cos t+y_1\\sin t) + \\sqrt{-1}(y_1\\cos t - x_1 \\sin t)$.\nThe velocity vector at $t=0$ is $(y_1, -x_1)$, which corresponds to the vector field component $y_1\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1} - x_1\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_1}$.\nFor $(z_2)$, the action is by $\\mathrm{e}^{-\\sqrt{-1}mt}$, so the velocity vector is $(my_2, -mx_2)$, corresponding to the component $my_2\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_2} - mx_2\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_2}$.\nThe full infinitesimal generator is $X = y_1\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1} - x_1\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_1} + my_2\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_2} - mx_2\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_2}$.\n\nNext, we express the symplectic form $\\omega$ in real coordinates.\nGiven $z_k = x_k + \\sqrt{-1}y_k$, we have $dz_k = dx_k + \\sqrt{-1}dy_k$ and $d\\overline{z}_k = dx_k - \\sqrt{-1}dy_k$.\nThen $dz_k \\wedge d\\overline{z}_k = (dx_k + \\sqrt{-1}dy_k) \\wedge (dx_k - \\sqrt{-1}dy_k) = -\\sqrt{-1}dx_k \\wedge dy_k + \\sqrt{-1}dy_k \\wedge dx_k = -2\\sqrt{-1}dx_k \\wedge dy_k$.\nThe symplectic form is $\\omega=\\frac{\\sqrt{-1}}{2}\\left(dz_{1}\\wedge d\\overline{z}_{1}+dz_{2}\\wedge d\\overline{z}_{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{-1}}{2}(-2\\sqrt{-1}dx_1\\wedge dy_1 - 2\\sqrt{-1}dx_2\\wedge dy_2) = dx_1\\wedge dy_1 + dx_2\\wedge dy_2$.\n\nNow we compute the contraction $\\iota_X\\omega$:\n$\\iota_X\\omega = \\iota_X(dx_1\\wedge dy_1) + \\iota_X(dx_2\\wedge dy_2)$.\n$\\iota_X(dx_1\\wedge dy_1) = (X \\cdot dx_1)dy_1 - (X \\cdot dy_1)dx_1 = y_1 dy_1 - (-x_1)dx_1 = x_1dx_1 + y_1dy_1$.\n$\\iota_X(dx_2\\wedge dy_2) = (X \\cdot dx_2)dy_2 - (X \\cdot dy_2)dx_2 = my_2 dy_2 - (-mx_2)dx_2 = m(x_2dx_2 + y_2dy_2)$.\nSo, $\\iota_X\\omega = x_1dx_1 + y_1dy_1 + m(x_2dx_2 + y_2dy_2)$.\nThis 1-form is exact. We have $\\iota_X\\omega = d\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(x_1^2+y_1^2) + \\frac{m}{2}(x_2^2+y_2^2)\\right) = d\\left(\\frac{1}{2}|z_1|^2 + \\frac{m}{2}|z_2|^2\\right)$.\nFrom $d\\mu = \\iota_X\\omega$, we integrate to find the moment map, unique up to an additive constant which we set to zero:\n$\\mu(z_1, z_2) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(|z_1|^2 + m|z_2|^2\\right)$.\n\nThe reduced space is the quotient $M_{\\mathrm{red}} = \\mu^{-1}(c)/S^1$ for $c>0$. The level set is $\\mu^{-1}(c) = \\left\\{ (z_1,z_2) \\in \\mathbb{C}^2 \\mid |z_1|^2 + m|z_2|^2 = 2c \\right\\}$. This is a compact 3-dimensional ellipsoid, diffeomorphic to $S^3$. The $S^1$ action preserves this level set because $\\mu$ is invariant under the action.\nThe structure of the quotient space $M_{\\mathrm{red}}$ depends on the stabilizers of the action on $\\mu^{-1}(c)$. A point $(z_1,z_2)$ has a non-trivial stabilizer if there exists $\\theta \\in (0, 2\\pi)$ such that $(\\mathrm{e}^{\\sqrt{-1}\\theta}z_1, \\mathrm{e}^{\\sqrt{-1}m\\theta}z_2) = (z_1, z_2)$.\n1. If $z_1 \\neq 0$ and $z_2 \\neq 0$, we need $\\mathrm{e}^{\\sqrt{-1}\\theta}=1$ and $\\mathrm{e}^{\\sqrt{-1}m\\theta}=1$. The first implies $\\theta$ is a multiple of $2\\pi$, so the stabilizer is trivial.\n2. If $z_1 \\neq 0$ and $z_2 = 0$, the point must satisfy $|z_1|^2=2c$. The condition becomes $\\mathrm{e}^{\\sqrt{-1}\\theta}z_1=z_1$, which also implies a trivial stabilizer.\n3. If $z_1 = 0$ and $z_2 \\neq 0$, the point must satisfy $m|z_2|^2=2c$. The condition for a non-trivial stabilizer is $\\mathrm{e}^{\\sqrt{-1}m\\theta}z_2=z_2$, which requires $\\mathrm{e}^{\\sqrt{-1}m\\theta}=1$. This holds for $\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi k}{m}$ for integers $k=0, 1, \\dots, m-1$. Since $m\\geq 2$, this stabilizer group is the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_m$.\n\nThe set of points with non-trivial stabilizers is the circle $\\mathcal{C} = \\{ (0, z_2) \\in \\mathbb{C}^2 \\mid |z_2|^2 = 2c/m \\}$. The $S^1$ action on a point $(0, z_2) \\in \\mathcal{C}$ is given by $\\mathrm{e}^{\\sqrt{-1}\\theta}\\cdot(0, z_2) = (0, \\mathrm{e}^{\\sqrt{-1}m\\theta}z_2)$. As $\\theta$ varies, this traces out the entire circle $\\mathcal{C}$. Thus, $\\mathcal{C}$ is a single orbit of the $S^1$ action. In the quotient space $M_{\\mathrm{red}}$, this entire orbit is identified to a single point, which will be the unique singular point of the resulting orbifold. This point corresponds to $[0:1]$ in the weighted projective space $\\mathbb{C}P^1_{1,m}$.\n\nTo find the cone angle, we analyze the local structure of the orbifold at this singular point using the slice theorem. Let $p_0 = (0, \\sqrt{2c/m})$ be a point on the singular orbit. The local model of the orbifold is given by the quotient of a normal slice to the orbit at $p_0$ by the action of the stabilizer group $\\Gamma_{p_0} = \\mathbb{Z}_m$.\nThe tangent space to $\\mathbb{C}^2$ at $p_0$ is $T_{p_0}\\mathbb{C}^2 \\cong \\mathbb{C}^2$. The tangent space to the orbit $S^1 \\cdot p_0$ is spanned by the vector field $X$ evaluated at $p_0$.\nThe normal slice can be identified with the $z_1$-plane, i.e., $S = \\{(z_1, 0) \\mid z_1 \\in \\mathbb{C}\\} \\subset T_{p_0}\\mathbb{C}^2$.\nWe need to determine how the stabilizer group $\\mathbb{Z}_m$ acts on this slice. An element of the stabilizer group is of the form $g_k = \\mathrm{e}^{2\\pi\\sqrt{-1}k/m}$ for $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, m-1\\}$. Its action on a point $(z_1, z_2)$ is $(g_k z_1, g_k^m z_2)$. Since $g_k^m = (\\mathrm{e}^{2\\pi\\sqrt{-1}k/m})^m=\\mathrm{e}^{2\\pi\\sqrt{-1}k}=1$, the action of the stabilizer element on a nearby point $(z_1, \\sqrt{2c/m}+\\delta z_2)$ is approximately:\n$g_k \\cdot (z_1, \\sqrt{2c/m}+\\delta z_2) = (\\mathrm{e}^{2\\pi\\sqrt{-1}k/m}z_1, \\sqrt{2c/m}+\\delta z_2)$.\nThe action on the normal slice (the $z_1$-plane) is therefore a rotation: $z_1 \\mapsto \\mathrm{e}^{2\\pi\\sqrt{-1}k/m} z_1$.\nThe local structure of the orbifold at the singular point is thus given by the quotient of the complex plane by this action of $\\mathbb{Z}_m$: $\\mathbb{C}/\\mathbb{Z}_m$. This space is an orbifold cone. The map $z \\mapsto z^m$ identifies $\\mathbb{C}/\\mathbb{Z}_m$ with $\\mathbb{C}$ topologically. Geometrically, this describes a cone whose total angle around the apex is $\\frac{2\\pi}{m}$. This is because the fundamental domain for this action on the plane is a wedge (a sector of a circle) with angle $\\frac{2\\pi}{m}$. Identifying the edges of this wedge forms a cone. The total angle at the apex of this cone is the angle of the wedge.\n\nTherefore, the cone angle at the unique singular point of $M_{\\mathrm{red}}$ is $\\frac{2\\pi}{m}$ radians.",

The canonical symplectic form on the cotangent bundle $T^{*}\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is $\\omega = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} dx_{i} \\wedge dp_{i}$, and the associated canonical Poisson bracket is $\\{F, G\\} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left( \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x_{i}} \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial p_{i}} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p_{i}} \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x_{i}} \\right)$ for smooth functions $F, G$ on $T^{*}\\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\n\nImpose the holonomic constraint $\\phi_{1}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} - R^{2} = 0$ for a fixed radius $R > 0$, together with the secondary constraint $\\phi_{2}(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{p}) = \\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{p} = 0$, ensuring that the momentum is tangent to the sphere of radius $R$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid. It presents a standard, well-posed question in theoretical mechanics concerning the derivation of the Dirac bracket for a particle constrained to a sphere, a classic example of a system with second-class constraints. All necessary information is provided, the constraints are consistent, and the problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of Hamiltonian mechanics and symplectic geometry. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe Dirac bracket for two smooth functions $F$ and $G$ on the phase space, in the presence of a set of second-class constraints $\\{\\phi_{\\alpha}\\}$, is defined as:\n$$\n\\{F, G\\}_{D} = \\{F, G\\} - \\sum_{\\alpha, \\beta} \\{F, \\phi_{\\alpha}\\} (C^{-1})_{\\alpha\\beta} \\{\\phi_{\\beta}, G\\}\n$$\nwhere $\\{F, G\\}$ is the canonical Poisson bracket, and $C^{-1}$ is the inverse of the constraint matrix $C_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\{\\phi_{\\alpha}, \\phi_{\\beta}\\}$. All brackets must be evaluated on the constraint surface $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\nThe phase space is $T^{*}\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with coordinates $(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{p}) = (x_1, x_2, x_3, p_1, p_2, p_3)$. The canonical Poisson bracket is given by $\\{F, G\\} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left( \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x_{i}} \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial p_{i}} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p_{i}} \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x_{i}} \\right)$.\n\nThe two constraints are:\n$1$. $\\phi_{1}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} - R^{2} = \\sum_{k=1}^{3} x_{k}^{2} - R^{2} = 0$\n$2$. $\\phi_{2}(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{p}) = \\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{p} = \\sum_{k=1}^{3} x_{k} p_{k} = 0$\n\nFirst, we must compute the constraint matrix $C_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\{\\phi_{\\alpha}, \\phi_{\\beta}\\}$ for $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\n$$\nC_{11} = \\{\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{1}\\} = 0\n$$\n$$\nC_{22} = \\{\\phi_{2}, \\phi_{2}\\} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\phi_{2}}{\\partial x_{i}} \\frac{\\partial \\phi_{2}}{\\partial p_{i}} - \\frac{\\partial \\phi_{2}}{\\partial p_{i}} \\frac{\\partial \\phi_{2}}{\\partial x_{i}} \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (p_{i}x_{i} - x_{i}p_{i}) = 0\n$$\n$$\nC_{12} = \\{\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{2}\\} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\phi_{1}}{\\partial x_{i}} \\frac{\\partial \\phi_{2}}{\\partial p_{i}} - \\frac{\\partial \\phi_{1}}{\\partial p_{i}} \\frac{\\partial \\phi_{2}}{\\partial x_{i}} \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} ((2x_{i})(x_{i}) - (0)(p_{i})) = 2\\sum_{i=1}^{3} x_{i}^{2} = 2(\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{x})\n$$\nOn the constraint surface $\\mathcal{C}$, $\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} = R^{2}$, so $C_{12} = 2R^{2}$.\nSince the Poisson bracket is antisymmetric, $C_{21} = \\{\\phi_{2}, \\phi_{1}\\} = -\\{\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{2}\\} = -2R^{2}$.\nThe constraint matrix is thus:\n$$\nC = \\begin{pmatrix} C_{11} & C_{12} \\\\ C_{21} & C_{22} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 2R^{2} \\\\ -2R^{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant is $\\det(C) = (0)(0) - (2R^{2})(-2R^{2}) = 4R^{4}$. Since $R > 0$, $\\det(C) \\neq 0$, which confirms that the constraints are second-class. The inverse matrix is:\n$$\nC^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(C)} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -2R^{2} \\\\ 2R^{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{4R^{4}} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -2R^{2} \\\\ 2R^{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -\\frac{1}{2R^{2}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2R^{2}} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSo, we have $(C^{-1})_{11}=0$, $(C^{-1})_{12}=-\\frac{1}{2R^2}$, $(C^{-1})_{21}=\\frac{1}{2R^2}$, and $(C^{-1})_{22}=0$.\n\nNext, we compute the Poisson brackets of the functions $F=x_{i}$ and $G=p_{j}$ with the constraints $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$.\nFor $F=x_{i}$:\n$$\n\\{x_{i}, \\phi_{1}\\} = \\{x_{i}, \\sum_{k=1}^{3} x_{k}^{2} - R^{2}\\} = \\sum_{k,l=1}^{3} \\left( \\frac{\\partial x_{i}}{\\partial x_{l}} \\frac{\\partial (x_{k}^{2})}{\\partial p_{l}} - \\frac{\\partial x_{i}}{\\partial p_{l}} \\frac{\\partial (x_{k}^{2})}{\\partial x_{l}} \\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\{x_{i}, \\phi_{2}\\} = \\{x_{i}, \\sum_{k=1}^{3} x_{k}p_{k}\\} = \\sum_{k=1}^{3} \\{x_{i}, x_{k}p_{k}\\} = \\sum_{k=1}^{3} (x_{k}\\{x_{i}, p_{k}\\} + \\{x_{i}, x_{k}\\}p_{k}) = \\sum_{k=1}^{3} x_{k}\\delta_{ik} = x_{i}\n$$\nFor $G=p_{j}$:\n$$\n\\{p_{j}, \\phi_{1}\\} = \\{p_{j}, \\sum_{k=1}^{3} x_{k}^{2} - R^{2}\\} = \\sum_{k=1}^{3} \\{p_{j}, x_{k}^{2}\\} = \\sum_{k=1}^{3} (x_{k}\\{p_{j}, x_{k}\\} + \\{p_{j}, x_{k}\\}x_{k}) = \\sum_{k=1}^{3} 2x_{k}(-\\delta_{jk}) = -2x_{j}\n$$\nConsequently, $\\{\\phi_{1}, p_{j}\\} = -\\{p_{j}, \\phi_{1}\\} = 2x_{j}$.\n$$\n\\{p_{j}, \\phi_{2}\\} = \\{p_{j}, \\sum_{k=1}^{3} x_{k}p_{k}\\} = \\sum_{k=1}^{3} \\{p_{j}, x_{k}p_{k}\\} = \\sum_{k=1}^{3} (x_{k}\\{p_{j}, p_{k}\\} + \\{p_{j}, x_{k}\\}p_{k}) = \\sum_{k=1}^{3} (-\\delta_{jk})p_{k} = -p_{j}\n$$\nConsequently, $\\{\\phi_{2}, p_{j}\\} = -\\{p_{j}, \\phi_{2}\\} = p_{j}$.\n\nNow we can compute the Dirac bracket $\\{x_{i}, p_{j}\\}_{D}$. The canonical bracket is $\\{x_{i}, p_{j}\\} = \\delta_{ij}$. The correction term is:\n$$\n\\sum_{\\alpha, \\beta=1}^{2} \\{x_{i}, \\phi_{\\alpha}\\} (C^{-1})_{\\alpha\\beta} \\{\\phi_{\\beta}, p_{j}\\} = \\{x_{i}, \\phi_{1}\\}(C^{-1})_{11}\\{\\phi_{1}, p_{j}\\} + \\{x_{i}, \\phi_{1}\\}(C^{-1})_{12}\\{\\phi_{2}, p_{j}\\} + \\{x_{i}, \\phi_{2}\\}(C^{-1})_{21}\\{\\phi_{1}, p_{j}\\} + \\{x_{i}, \\phi_{2}\\}(C^{-1})_{22}\\{\\phi_{2}, p_{j}\\}\n$$\nSince $\\{x_{i}, \\phi_{1}\\} = 0$, the first two terms vanish. Since $(C^{-1})_{22} = 0$, the fourth term vanishes. We are left with only the third term:\n$$\n\\text{Correction} = \\{x_{i}, \\phi_{2}\\}(C^{-1})_{21}\\{\\phi_{1}, p_{j}\\} = (x_{i}) \\left(\\frac{1}{2R^{2}}\\right) (2x_{j}) = \\frac{x_{i}x_{j}}{R^{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of the Dirac bracket:\n$$\n\\{x_{i}, p_{j}\\}_{D} = \\{x_{i}, p_{j}\\} - \\frac{x_{i}x_{j}}{R^{2}} = \\delta_{ij} - \\frac{x_{i}x_{j}}{R^{2}}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the Dirac bracket between the position and momentum components on the constraint surface.\n\nThe second part of the question asks for the relation of this result to the symplectic structure on the reduced phase space $T^{*}S^{2}$. The constraint surface $\\mathcal{C} = \\{(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{p}) \\in T^{*}\\mathbb{R}^{3} \\mid \\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} = R^{2}, \\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{p} = 0\\}$ is precisely the cotangent bundle of the sphere of radius $R$, denoted $T^{*}S^{2}$. The Dirac bracket endows this reduced phase space with a Poisson structure. The fundamental brackets on this space are given by the Dirac brackets of the coordinate functions.\n\nThe expression $\\{x_{i}, p_{j}\\}_{D} = \\delta_{ij} - \\frac{x_{i}x_{j}}{R^{2}}$ has a clear geometric interpretation. The term $\\frac{x_{i}x_{j}}{R^{2}}$ is the $ij$-th component of the projection operator onto the radial direction $\\mathbf{x}/R$. Therefore, the matrix $P_{ij} = \\delta_{ij} - \\frac{x_{i}x_{j}}{R^{2}}$ represents the projection operator onto the tangent plane to the sphere at the point $\\mathbf{x}$. The Dirac bracket $\\{x_{i}, p_{j}\\}_{D}$ effectively replaces the identity matrix $\\delta_{ij}$ from the unconstrained canonical bracket with the projection operator $P_{ij}$. This reflects the fact that on the sphere, momentum components must be tangent to the surface, and infinitesimal displacements (generated by momentum) must lie within the tangent plane. The canonical commutation relations of the ambient space $T^*\\mathbb{R}^3$ are thus projected onto the tangent bundle of the constrained manifold $S^2$, resulting in the modified Dirac bracket relations. The Poisson tensor corresponding to the canonical symplectic form on $T^*S^2$, when expressed in the ambient coordinates of $\\mathbb{R}^3$, has its $(x_i, p_j)$ component given precisely by this expression.",
