            "solution": "The problem statement is a standard exercise in differential geometry and is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and internally consistent. We can therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe real projective space $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is defined as the quotient of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ by the action of the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{R}^* = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$, where the action is scalar multiplication. A point in $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is an equivalence class $[x]$, representing the line through the origin and the point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. Any such line intersects the unit sphere $S^n = \\{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\mid \\|y\\|=1\\}$ at exactly two antipodal points, $\\{y, -y\\}$. This provides a canonical identification of $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ with the quotient space $S^n / \\sim$, where $y \\sim -y$. This equivalence relation is induced by a group action, which we will use to establish the manifold structure.\n\n**Part 1: Justification as a Smooth Manifold**\n\nWe model $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ as the quotient of the $n$-sphere $S^n$ by the action of the group $G = \\mathbb{Z}_2 = \\{1, -1\\}$.\nThe manifold is $M = S^n$, which is a smooth, compact, embedded submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ of dimension $n$.\nThe group is $G = \\mathbb{Z}_2$. As a finite group, it is a $0$-dimensional Lie group.\nThe action of $G$ on $M$ is given by multiplication: for $g \\in G$ and $x \\in S^n$, the action is $(g, x) \\mapsto g \\cdot x$. Explicitly, $1 \\cdot x = x$ and $(-1) \\cdot x = -x$. This action is smooth, as it is the restriction of the smooth scalar multiplication map on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.\n\nTo show that the quotient space $\\mathbb{RP}^n \\cong S^n / G$ is a smooth manifold, we invoke the Quotient Manifold Theorem. The theorem states that if a Lie group $G$ acts smoothly, freely, and properly on a smooth manifold $M$, then the orbit space $M/G$ has a unique smooth manifold structure such that the canonical projection $\\pi: M \\to M/G$ is a smooth submersion. We must verify that the action is free and proper.\n\n1.  **Free Action**: An action is free if the stabilizer of every point is trivial. That is, for any $x \\in S^n$, if $g \\cdot x = x$ for some $g \\in G$, then $g$ must be the identity element, $g=1$.\n    If $g = -1$, the condition is $-x = x$, which implies $x = 0$. However, $x \\in S^n$, so $\\|x\\|=1$ and $x \\neq 0$. Thus, the only element of $G$ that fixes any point in $S^n$ is the identity element $g=1$. The action is therefore free.\n\n2.  **Proper Action**: A continuous action of a group $G$ on a topological space $M$ is proper if the map $\\Psi: G \\times M \\to M \\times M$ given by $\\Psi(g, x) = (x, g \\cdot x)$ is a proper map (the inverse image of any compact set is compact). A sufficient condition for an action to be proper is if the group $G$ is compact and the space $M$ is Hausdorff. Here, $G = \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is a finite group, so it is compact. The sphere $S^n$ is a subspace of a Euclidean space, so it is Hausdorff. Therefore, the action of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ on $S^n$ is proper.\n\nSince the action of $G = \\mathbb{Z}_2$ on $M = S^n$ is smooth, free, and proper, the Quotient Manifold Theorem guarantees that $\\mathbb{RP}^n = S^n / \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is a smooth manifold. The projection map $\\pi: S^n \\to \\mathbb{RP}^n$, given by $\\pi(x) = [x] = \\{x, -x\\}$, is a local diffeomorphism.\n\n**Part 2: Construction of a Smooth Atlas**\n\nWe construct a smooth atlas for $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ using homogeneous coordinates. A point in $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is an equivalence class $[x_0: x_1: \\dots: x_n]$, where not all $x_i$ are zero, and $[x_0: \\dots: x_n] = [\\lambda x_0: \\dots: \\lambda x_n]$ for any $\\lambda \\neq 0$.\n\nFor each $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$, we define an open set $U_i \\subset \\mathbb{RP}^n$ by:\n$$U_i = \\{ [x_0: \\dots: x_n] \\in \\mathbb{RP}^n \\mid x_i \\neq 0 \\}$$\nThese sets are open because their preimages under the quotient map $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\setminus \\{0\\} \\to \\mathbb{RP}^n$, which are $\\pi^{-1}(U_i) = \\{ (x_0, \\dots, x_n) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\setminus \\{0\\} \\mid x_i \\neq 0 \\}$, are open. The collection $\\{U_i\\}_{i=0}^n$ forms a cover of $\\mathbb{RP}^n$, since for any point $[x]$, at least one coordinate $x_i$ must be non-zero.\n\nNext, we define the chart maps $\\phi_i: U_i \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ for each $i$. For a point $[x_0: \\dots: x_n] \\in U_i$, we have $x_i \\neq 0$. The map is defined by dividing all coordinates by $x_i$ and omitting the $i$-th coordinate (which becomes $1$):\n$$\\phi_i([x_0: \\dots: x_n]) = \\left( \\frac{x_0}{x_i}, \\dots, \\frac{x_{i-1}}{x_i}, \\frac{x_{i+1}}{x_i}, \\dots, \\frac{x_n}{x_i} \\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$$\nThis map is well-defined because if we use a different representative $[\\lambda x]$ with $\\lambda \\neq 0$, the ratios $\\frac{\\lambda x_j}{\\lambda x_i} = \\frac{x_j}{x_i}$ remain unchanged.\n\nThe inverse map $\\phi_i^{-1}: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to U_i$ re-inserts a $1$ at the $i$-th position to form a homogeneous coordinate. To be precise with indexing, let a point in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ be denoted by $u=(u_0, \\dots, \\widehat{u_i}, \\dots, u_n)$, where the hat notation indicates omission of the $i$-th component. Then the inverse map is given by:\n$$\\phi_i^{-1}(u) = [u_0: \\dots: u_{i-1}: 1: u_{i+1}: \\dots: u_n]$$\nThese maps are homeomorphisms between $U_i$ and $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nTo verify that this collection of charts $\\{(U_i, \\phi_i)\\}_{i=0}^n$ forms a smooth atlas, we must check that the transition maps are smooth. Consider two charts $(U_i, \\phi_i)$ and $(U_j, \\phi_j)$ with $i \\neq j$. The transition map is $\\phi_j \\circ \\phi_i^{-1}$, defined on the open set $\\phi_i(U_i \\cap U_j)$.\n\nThe intersection is $U_i \\cap U_j = \\{[x] \\in \\mathbb{RP}^n \\mid x_i \\neq 0 \\text{ and } x_j \\neq 0\\}$.\nThe domain of the transition map is $\\phi_i(U_i \\cap U_j)$. An element in this set is of the form $u = \\phi_i([x])$ where $x_j \\neq 0$. In terms of the coordinates of $u = (u_k)_{k \\neq i}$, where $u_k = x_k/x_i$, the condition $x_j \\neq 0$ is equivalent to $u_j = x_j/x_i \\neq 0$. So, the domain is $\\{ u \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid u_j \\neq 0 \\}$, which is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nLet $u = (u_k)_{k \\neq i}$ be a point in this domain. First, we apply $\\phi_i^{-1}$:\n$$\\phi_i^{-1}(u) = [u_0: \\dots: u_{i-1}: 1: u_{i+1}: \\dots: u_n]$$\nLet's call the representative homogeneous coordinate vector $v$. So $v_k = u_k$ for $k \\neq i$, and $v_i = 1$.\nNow we apply $\\phi_j$:\n$$\\phi_j([v]) = \\left( \\frac{v_0}{v_j}, \\dots, \\frac{v_{j-1}}{v_j}, \\frac{v_{j+1}}{v_j}, \\dots, \\frac{v_n}{v_j} \\right)$$\nLet the resulting vector in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ be $w = (w_k)_{k \\neq j}$. Its components are given by $w_k = v_k/v_j$. We express $w$ in terms of $u$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item For $k \\neq i$ and $k \\neq j$: $w_k = \\frac{v_k}{v_j} = \\frac{u_k}{u_j}$.\n    \\item For $k = i$ (this component exists in $w$ since $i \\neq j$): $w_i = \\frac{v_i}{v_j} = \\frac{1}{u_j}$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe map $\\phi_j \\circ \\phi_i^{-1}$ is given by:\n$$u = (u_k)_{k\\neq i} \\mapsto w = (w_k)_{k\\neq j}$$\nwhere the components $w_k$ are rational functions of the components $u_k$. The only denominator is $u_j$, which is non-zero on the domain $\\phi_i(U_i \\cap U_j)$. Therefore, the transition map is a smooth ($C^\\infty$) function from an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ to an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\nThis holds for any pair $(i, j)$, so the atlas is a smooth atlas.\n\n**Part 3: Dimension of $\\mathbb{RP}^n$**\n\nThe dimension of a smooth manifold is defined as the dimension of the Euclidean space to which its chart domains are mapped. In the atlas we constructed, each chart map $\\phi_i$ is a map from an open set $U_i \\subset \\mathbb{RP}^n$ to $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The codomain of each chart map is $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The dimension of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is $n$.\nTherefore, the dimension of the real projective space $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is $n$.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the established mathematical theory of Lie groups and Riemannian geometry, it is well-posed, objective, and internally consistent.\n\nThe problem asks for two parts: first, to provide the standard spherical coordinate parametrization for the $2$-sphere $S^{2}$, and second, to compute the scaling factor $\\lambda$ for the Riemannian metric on $S^{2}$ induced from the bi-invariant metric on $SO(3)$.\n\n**Part 1: Parametrization of $S^{2}$**\n\nThe $2$-sphere $S^{2}$ is the set of points in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ at unit distance from the origin. We use standard spherical coordinates $(\\theta, \\varphi)$, where $\\theta \\in (0,\\pi)$ is the polar angle measured from the positive $z$-axis and $\\varphi \\in (0,2\\pi)$ is the azimuthal angle in the $xy$-plane from the positive $x$-axis.

This means that for any point $p \\in S^2$ and any pair of tangent vectors $u, v \\in T_p S^2$, their inner product is given by\n$$\ng_{S^2}(u, v)_p = g_{G}(\\tilde{u}, \\tilde{v})_R\n$$\nwhere $R$ is any element in $G$ such that $\\pi(R) = p$, and $\\tilde{u}, \\tilde{v}$ are the unique horizontal lifts of $u, v$ to the tangent space $T_R G$. The horizontal space $\\mathcal{H}_R$ is the orthogonal complement of the vertical space $\\mathcal{V}_R = \\ker(d\\pi_R)$ with respect to the metric $g_G$.\n\nThe metric on $G=SO(3)$ is left-invariant, originating from the inner product $\\langle A, B \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{tr}(AB)$ on the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(3) = T_e G$. The vertical space at the identity, $\\mathcal{V}_e$, is the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{h}$ of the subgroup $H=SO(2)$. The horizontal space at the identity, $\\mathcal{H}_e$, is the orthogonal complement of $\\mathfrak{h}$ in $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$. Due to the left-invariance of the metric, the horizontal space at any $R \\in G$ is $\\mathcal{H}_R = dL_R(\\mathcal{H}_e)$, where $L_R$ is left multiplication by $R$.\n\nThe differential of $\\pi$ at an element $R \\in G$ applied to a vector $Y = dL_R(A) \\in T_R G$ (for $A \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$) is $d\\pi_R(Y) = \\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0} \\pi(R\\exp(tA)) = R(A e_3)$.\nA vector $Y=dL_R(A)$ is a horizontal lift of $u \\in T_p S^2$ if $A \\in \\mathcal{H}_e$ and $d\\pi_R(Y) = u$.

The standard basis for $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$ consists of the infinitesimal generators of rotations about the coordinate axes:\n$$\nL_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad L_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad L_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$H=SO(2)$ is the group of rotations about the $z$-axis, so its Lie algebra is $\\mathfrak{h} = \\operatorname{span}\\{L_3\\}$. This is the vertical subalgebra $\\mathcal{V}_e$.\nThe horizontal subalgebra $\\mathcal{H}_e$ is the orthogonal complement of $\\mathfrak{h}$. For any $A \\in \\mathfrak{h}$ and $B \\in \\mathcal{H}_e$, we must have $\\langle A, B \\rangle = 0$. The basis $\\{L_1, L_2, L_3\\}$ is orthonormal with respect to the given inner product:\n$$\n\\langle L_i, L_j \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{tr}(L_i L_j) = \\delta_{ij}\n$$\nFor instance, $\\langle L_1, L_1 \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{tr}(L_1^2) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{tr}\\left(\\operatorname{diag}(0, -1, -1)\\right) = 1$. The orthogonality, e.g. $\\langle L_1, L_2 \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{tr}(L_1 L_2) = 0$, can be checked similarly.\nThus, $\\mathcal{H}_e = \\operatorname{span}\\{L_1, L_2\\}$.\n\nTo find $\\lambda$, we compute the metric components at a convenient, non-singular point. Let's choose the point $p = (1,0,0) \\in S^2$, which corresponds to coordinates $(\\theta, \\varphi) = (\\pi/2, 0)$. The tangent vectors for the coordinate system at this point are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial \\theta}\\bigg|_{(\\pi/2, 0)} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\pi/2)\\cos(0) \\\\ \\cos(\\pi/2)\\sin(0) \\\\ -\\sin(\\pi/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = -e_3\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial \\varphi}\\bigg|_{(\\pi/2, 0)} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin(\\pi/2)\\sin(0) \\\\ \\sin(\\pi/2)\\cos(0) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = e_2\n$$\nThe metric components are $g_{\\theta\\theta} = g_{S^2}(-e_3, -e_3)_p$, $g_{\\varphi\\varphi} = g_{S^2}(e_2, e_2)_p$, and $g_{\\theta\\varphi} = g_{S^2}(-e_3, e_2)_p$.\n\nWe need an $R \\in SO(3)$ such that $\\pi(R) = R e_3 = p = e_1$. A rotation by $\\pi/2$ about the $y$-axis works:\n$$\nR = R_y(\\pi/2) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\pi/2) & 0 & \\sin(\\pi/2) \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -\\sin(\\pi/2) & 0 & \\cos(\\pi/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nIndeed, $R e_3 = (1,0,0)^T = e_1 = p$.\n\nNow we find the horizontal pre-images in $\\mathcal{H}_e = \\operatorname{span}\\{L_1, L_2\\}$ for our tangent vectors.\nFor $u = -e_3$, we seek $A \\in \\mathcal{H}_e$ such that $R A e_3 = -e_3$. Let $A = c_1 L_1 + c_2 L_2$.\n$A e_3 = c_1(L_1 e_3) + c_2(L_2 e_3) = c_1(-e_2) + c_2(e_1) = (c_2, -c_1, 0)^T$.\n$R(A e_3) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c_2 \\\\ -c_1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -c_1 \\\\ -c_2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nWe set this equal to $-e_3 = (0,0,-1)^T$, which gives $-c_1 = 0$ and $-c_2 = -1$, so $c_1=0, c_2=1$. The pre-image is $A = L_2$.\nThe metric component is $g_{\\theta\\theta} = \\langle A, A \\rangle = \\langle L_2, L_2 \\rangle = 1$.\n\nFor $v = e_2$, we seek $B \\in \\mathcal{H}_e$ such that $R B e_3 = e_2$. Let $B = d_1 L_1 + d_2 L_2$.\n$R(B e_3) = (0, -d_1, -d_2)^T$.\nWe set this equal to $e_2 = (0,1,0)^T$, which gives $-d_1 = 1$ and $-d_2=0$, so $d_1=-1, d_2=0$. The pre-image is $B = -L_1$.\nThe metric component is $g_{\\varphi\\varphi} = \\langle B, B \\rangle = \\langle -L_1, -L_1 \\rangle = \\langle L_1, L_1 \\rangle = 1$.\n\nThe off-diagonal component is $g_{\\theta\\varphi} = \\langle A, B \\rangle = \\langle L_2, -L_1 \\rangle = -\\langle L_2, L_1 \\rangle = 0$ due to orthogonality.\n\nSo at $(\\theta, \\varphi) = (\\pi/2, 0)$, the metric is $ds^2 = g_{\\theta\\theta}d\\theta^2 + g_{\\varphi\\varphi}d\\varphi^2 = 1 \\cdot d\\theta^2 + 1 \\cdot d\\varphi^2$.\nWe compare this to the asserted general form $g = \\lambda (d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta d\\varphi^2)$. At $\\theta = \\pi/2$, $\\sin\\theta = 1$, so this form becomes $g = \\lambda (d\\theta^2 + d\\varphi^2)$.\nComparing our computed metric with this expression, we find $1 \\cdot (d\\theta^2 + d\\varphi^2) = \\lambda (d\\theta^2 + d\\varphi^2)$, which implies $\\lambda=1$.\nSince the metric on $SO(3)$ is bi-invariant and the action of $SO(3)$ on $S^2$ is transitive, the induced metric is $SO(3)$-invariant. The unique (up to scaling) $SO(3)$-invariant metric on $S^2$ is the standard round metric. Therefore, the constant $\\lambda$ determined at one point is valid for the entire sphere. The specific normalization $\\langle A, B \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{tr}(AB)$ on $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$ is precisely what yields the standard unit sphere metric on $S^2$, for which $\\lambda=1$.",

The first part concerns the topological identification of the quotient space $S^{2}/S^{1}$, and the second part connects this to the framework of Hamiltonian mechanics.\n\n**Part 1: The Quotient Space**\n\nWe are asked to construct a continuous function $q:S^{2}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ that is constant on the orbits of the given $S^{1}$ action and to show that it induces a homeomorphism between the orbit space $S^{2}/S^{1}$ and a closed interval.\n\nThe action of $S^{1}$ on a point $p=(x,y,z) \\in S^{2}$ is given by\n$$\n\\exp(i\\theta) \\cdot (x,y,z) = (x\\cos\\theta - y\\sin\\theta, x\\sin\\theta + y\\cos\\theta, z).\n$$\nAn orbit of this action is the set of all points obtained by letting $\\theta$ vary over $[0, 2\\pi)$. We observe that the $z$-coordinate of any point remains unchanged under this action. This suggests that the orbits are the sets of points on $S^{2}$ with a constant $z$-coordinate. These are the \"circles of latitude\" on the sphere.\n\nLet's define the function $q: S^{2} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ by the projection onto the $z$-axis:\n$$\nq(x,y,z) = z.\n$$\nWe must verify its properties.\n$1$. **Continuity**: The function $q$ is the restriction to $S^{2}$ of the projection map $\\pi_z: \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, $(x,y,z) \\mapsto z$. Since $\\pi_z$ is continuous and $S^{2}$ is a subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, the restriction $q$ is also continuous.\n$2$. **Constancy on orbits**: As observed from the definition of the action, the $z$-coordinate is an invariant. For any point $(x,y,z) \\in S^{2}$ and any $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, we have $q(\\exp(i\\theta) \\cdot (x,y,z)) = z = q(x,y,z)$. Thus, $q$ is constant along the $S^{1}$-orbits.\n$3$. **Image of $q$**: A point $(x,y,z)$ is on the unit sphere $S^{2}$, so it satisfies the equation $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=1$. This implies $z^{2} \\le 1$, so the value of $z$ must lie in the interval $[-1,1]$. For any $z_{0} \\in [-1,1]$, the point $(\\sqrt{1-z_{0}^{2}}, 0, z_{0})$ lies on $S^{2}$ and has $q$-value $z_{0}$. Therefore, the image of the function $q$ is precisely the closed interval $q(S^{2}) = [-1,1]$.\n\nNow, we must show that the induced map $\\overline{q}: S^{2}/S^{1} \\to [-1,1]$ is a homeomorphism. Let $\\pi: S^{2} \\to S^{2}/S^{1}$ be the canonical projection map, which sends a point to its orbit. The space $S^{2}/S^{1}$ is endowed with the quotient topology. Since $q$ is constant on the fibers of $\\pi$ (the orbits), a unique map $\\overline{q}: S^{2}/S^{1} \\to [-1,1]$ exists such that $q = \\overline{q} \\circ \\pi$.\n\n- **$\\overline{q}$ is continuous**: By the universal property of the quotient topology, $\\overline{q}$ is continuous if and only if $q = \\overline{q} \\circ \\pi$ is continuous. We have already established that $q$ is a continuous function.\n- **$\\overline{q}$ is a bijection**:\n    - **Injectivity**: Let $[p_{1}]$ and $[p_{2}]$ be two distinct elements in $S^{2}/S^{1}$. This means the orbits of $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ are distinct subsets of $S^{2}$. Since the orbits are the level sets of the function $q$, distinct orbits must correspond to different values of $q$. Thus, $q(p_{1}) \\ne q(p_{2})$. This implies $\\overline{q}([p_{1}]) \\ne \\overline{q}([p_{2}])$. So, $\\overline{q}$ is injective.\n    - **Surjectivity**: The image of $\\overline{q}$ is the same as the image of $q$, which we found to be $[-1,1]$. Thus, $\\overline{q}$ is surjective onto $[-1,1]$.\n- **$\\overline{q}$ is a homeomorphism**: We have established that $\\overline{q}$ is a continuous bijection. To show it is a homeomorphism, we must show that its inverse $\\overline{q}^{-1}: [-1,1] \\to S^{2}/S^{1}$ is also continuous. A continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism.\n    - The space $S^{2}$ is compact. The quotient space $S^{2}/S^{1}$ is the image of the compact space $S^{2}$ under the continuous map $\\pi$, so $S^{2}/S^{1}$ is also compact.\n    - The target space $[-1,1]$ is a closed, bounded subset of $\\mathbb{R}$, which is a Hausdorff space.\n    - Therefore, $\\overline{q}$ is a continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space, and is thus a homeomorphism.\n\nFinally, we describe the boundary behavior. The space of orbits $S^{2}/S^{1}$ is identified with the interval $[-1,1]$.\n- The interior points $z \\in (-1,1)$ correspond to the orbits where $x^{2}+y^{2} = 1-z^{2} > 0$. These are circles, all diffeomorphic to $S^{1}$. These are the principal (or regular) orbits.\n- The boundary points $z=1$ and $z=-1$ correspond to orbits where $x^{2}+y^{2}=0$. These are the points $(0,0,1)$ (the North Pole) and $(0,0,-1)$ (the South Pole). These points are fixed by the action. These are singular orbits of dimension $0$.\n\n**Part 2: Hamiltonian Action and Momentum Map**\n\nWe now equip $S^{2}$ with its standard area form $\\omega$ and show that the $S^{1}$ action is Hamiltonian with momentum map $J=q$.\n\nThe Lie group is $G=S^{1}$. Its Lie algebra is $\\mathfrak{g} \\cong \\mathbb{R}$. Let's choose $\\xi=1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ as a basis element for $\\mathfrak{g}$. The group action $\\Phi: S^{1} \\times S^{2} \\to S^{2}$ is given by $\\Phi(\\theta, p) = \\exp(i\\theta) \\cdot p$. The fundamental vector field $X_{\\xi}$ at a point $p \\in S^{2}$ is defined as\n$$\nX_{\\xi}|_{p} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\Phi(\\exp(it\\xi), p).\n$$\nWith $\\xi=1$, this becomes\n$$\nX_{\\xi}|_{(x,y,z)} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} (x\\cos t - y\\sin t, x\\sin t + y\\cos t, z) = (-y, x, 0).\n$$\nIn terms of partial derivatives, $X_{\\xi} = -y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$.\n\nThe standard area form on $S^{2} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ (with outward orientation) is given by the restriction of the $2$-form $\\omega = x\\,dy\\wedge dz + y\\,dz\\wedge dx + z\\,dx\\wedge dy$ to the tangent bundle of $S^{2}$.\n\nThe action is Hamiltonian if there exists a momentum map $J: S^{2} \\to \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$ such that $\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega = d\\langle J, \\xi \\rangle$. Since $\\mathfrak{g} \\cong \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathfrak{g}^{*} \\cong \\mathbb{R}$, the momentum map is a function $J: S^{2} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, and the pairing $\\langle J, \\xi \\rangle$ is just the product $J \\cdot \\xi$. For our chosen basis element $\\xi=1$, the condition simplifies to $\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega = dJ$.\n\nLet's compute the left-hand side, the interior product $\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega$:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega &= \\iota_{(-y, x, 0)}(x\\,dy\\wedge dz + y\\,dz\\wedge dx + z\\,dx\\wedge dy) \\\\\n&= x\\,\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}(dy\\wedge dz) + y\\,\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}(dz\\wedge dx) + z\\,\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}(dx\\wedge dy) \\\\\n&= x( (\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}dy)dz - (\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}dz)dy ) + y( (\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}dz)dx - (\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}dx)dz ) + z( (\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}dx)dy - (\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}dy)dx ) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\nThe components of $X_{\\xi}$ are evaluated as contractions: $\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}dx = -y$, $\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}dy = x$, $\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}dz = 0$. Substituting these values:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega &= x( (x)dz - (0)dy ) + y( (0)dx - (-y)dz ) + z( (-y)dy - (x)dx ) \\\\\n&= x^{2}dz + y^{2}dz - z(x\\,dx + y\\,dy) \\\\\n&= (x^{2}+y^{2})dz - z(x\\,dx + y\\,dy).\n\\end{align*}\nThis is a $1$-form on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. We must consider its action on tangent vectors to $S^{2}$. The sphere is defined by $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=1$. Differentiating this constraint gives the relation for tangent vectors on $S^{2}$: $2x\\,dx + 2y\\,dy + 2z\\,dz = 0$, which implies $x\\,dx + y\\,dy = -z\\,dz$ when restricted to $T S^{2}$.\nSubstituting this relation into our expression for $\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega$:\n$$\n\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega = (x^{2}+y^{2})dz - z(-z\\,dz) = (x^{2}+y^{2})dz + z^{2}dz = (x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2})dz.\n$$\nSince we are on the sphere $S^{2}$, $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=1$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega = dz.\n$$\nComparing this with the Hamiltonian condition $\\iota_{X_{\\xi}}\\omega = dJ$, we find $dJ = dz$. Integrating this gives $J(x,y,z) = z + C$ for some constant $C$. By convention, the constant is often chosen to be zero, so we have\n$$\nJ(x,y,z) = z.\n$$\nThis is precisely the function $q(x,y,z)$ we constructed in the first part. This proves from first principles that the $S^{1}$ action is Hamiltonian with the momentum map given by $q(x,y,z)=z$. Had we chosen the opposite orientation for $S^{2}$, $\\omega'=-\\omega$, we would have found $J=-z$.\n\nThe connection between the orbit space description and the image of the momentum map is now clear. The function $q(x,y,z)=z$ plays a dual role.\n1. As a map parametrizing the orbits, it projects $S^{2}$ onto its orbit space $S^{2}/S^{1}$, which we identified with the interval $[-1,1]$.\n2. As the momentum map $J$ for the Hamiltonian $S^{1}$-action, its image $J(S^{2})$ is also the interval $[-1,1]$.\n\nThe level sets of the momentum map, $J^{-1}(c)$ for $c \\in [-1,1]$, are precisely the orbits of the group action. This is a fundamental feature of this system: the conserved quantity associated with the rotational symmetry (the $z$-component of angular momentum, represented by $J$) is constant on the orbits. The space of all possible values for this conserved quantity, $\\mathrm{Im}(J)$, is a direct representation of the space of all orbits, $S^{2}/S^{1}$. This elegant correspondence, $S^{2}/S^{1} \\cong \\mathrm{Im}(J)$, is a cornerstone of symplectic reduction and a simple illustration of the more general Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg convexity theorem for Hamiltonian torus actions.\nThe expression for the function $q$ in Cartesian coordinates is simply $z$.",
