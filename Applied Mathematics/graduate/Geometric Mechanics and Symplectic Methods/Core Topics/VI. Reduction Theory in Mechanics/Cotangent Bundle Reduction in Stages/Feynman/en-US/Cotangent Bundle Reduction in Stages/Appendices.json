            "problem": "Consider a smooth configuration manifold $Q=\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with global coordinates $(x,y,z)$, and its cotangent bundle $T^{*}Q$ with canonical fiber coordinates $(p_{x},p_{y},p_{z})$. Let $G=\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ act freely and properly on $Q$ by translations in the $y$- and $z$-coordinates, i.e., $(a,b)\\cdot(x,y,z)=(x,y+a,z+b)$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in the field of geometric mechanics, specifically concerning Marsden-Weinstein reduction. It is free of contradictions, ambiguities, and factual errors.\n\nThe task is to compute the reduced Poisson bracket of two functions, $f(x,p_{x})=x^{2}$ and $g(x,p_{x})=\\frac{1}{2}p_{x}^{2}$, on the reduced space obtained by cotangent bundle reduction of $T^{*}\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ by a translation group $G=\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The computation must proceed by first calculating the bracket on the ambient space $T^{*}Q$ and then descending to the reduced space. Finally, this result must be compared to the canonical bracket on the model for the reduced space, $T^{*}(Q/G)$.\n\nLet the configuration manifold be $Q=\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with global coordinates $(q^{1}, q^{2}, q^{3}) = (x, y, z)$. Its cotangent bundle $T^{*}Q \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{6}$ has canonical coordinates $(q^{i}, p_{i}) = (x,y,z,p_{x},p_{y},p_{z})$.\n\nThe Lie group $G=\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ acts on $Q$ by translation: for $(a,b) \\in G$ and $(x,y,z) \\in Q$, the action is $\\Phi_{(a,b)}(x,y,z)=(x,y+a,z+b)$. The Lie algebra is $\\mathfrak{g} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{2}$. We choose the standard basis for $\\mathfrak{g}$, $\\xi_{1}=(1,0)$ and $\\xi_{2}=(0,1)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the momentum map $J: T^{*}Q \\to \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$. For a cotangent-lifted action, the momentum map is given by the pairing of a covector with the infinitesimal generator of the action. The infinitesimal generator $\\xi_{Q}$ for $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ is a vector field on $Q$ given by $\\xi_{Q}(q) = \\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0} \\Phi_{\\exp(t\\xi)}(q)$.\nFor $\\xi_{1}=(1,0) \\in \\mathfrak{g}$, the generator is:\n$$\n\\xi_{1,Q}(x,y,z) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\Big|_{t=0}(x,y+t,z) = (0,1,0) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\n$$\nFor $\\xi_{2}=(0,1) \\in \\mathfrak{g}$, the generator is:\n$$\n\\xi_{2,Q}(x,y,z) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\Big|_{t=0}(x,y,z+t) = (0,0,1) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\n$$\nThe components of the momentum map, $J_1$ and $J_2$, are the pairings of a covector $\\alpha_{q} = p_{x}dx + p_{y}dy + p_{z}dz \\in T_{q}^{*}Q$ with these vector fields.\n$$\nJ_{1}(q,p) = \\langle \\alpha_{q}, \\xi_{1,Q}(q) \\rangle = \\langle p_{x}dx + p_{y}dy + p_{z}dz, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\rangle = p_{y}\n$$\n$$\nJ_{2}(q,p) = \\langle \\alpha_{q}, \\xi_{2,Q}(q) \\rangle = \\langle p_{x}dx + p_{y}dy + p_z dz, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\rangle = p_z\n$$\nThus, the momentum map is $J(x,y,z,p_{x},p_{y},p_{z}) = (p_{y},p_{z})$.\n\nThe problem specifies reduction at the value $\\mu=0 \\in \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$. The level set of the momentum map is:\n$$\nJ^{-1}(0) = \\{ (x,y,z,p_{x},p_{y},p_{z}) \\in T^{*}Q \\mid p_{y}=0, p_{z}=0 \\}\n$$\nThe reduced space is the quotient $P_{0} = J^{-1}(0)/G$. The action of $G$ on $T^{*}Q$ is the cotangent lift, which for this translation group is simply $(a,b) \\cdot (x,y,z,p_{x},p_{y},p_{z}) = (x,y+a,z+b,p_{x},p_{y},p_{z})$. The action on $J^{-1}(0)$ is thus $(a,b) \\cdot (x,y,z,p_{x},0,0) = (x,y+a,z+b,p_{x},0,0)$. The quotient action identifies points with the same $x$ and $p_x$ coordinates, effectively quotienting out the $y$ and $z$ coordinates. An orbit is uniquely determined by the values of $x$ and $p_x$.\nThis aligns with the Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer theorem for cotangent bundles, which states that $J^{-1}(0)/G \\cong T^{*}(Q/G)$. Here, $Q/G$ is the space of orbits of the $G$-action on $Q$, which are lines parallel to the $yz$-plane. This space is parametrized by the $x$-coordinate, so $Q/G \\cong \\mathbb{R}$. The cotangent bundle $T^{*}(Q/G)$ is therefore $T^{*}\\mathbb{R}$, with canonical coordinates $(x, p_{x})$. Thus, we have the identification $J^{-1}(0)/G \\cong T^{*}\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe problem provides two functions on the reduced space $T^{*}\\mathbb{R}$: $f(x,p_{x})=x^{2}$ and $g(x,p_{x})=\\frac{1}{2}p_{x}^{2}$. To compute their reduced bracket $\\{f,g\\}_{\\mathrm{red}}$ by descending from $T^{*}Q$, we must first find corresponding $G$-invariant functions on $T^{*}Q$. The natural choice is to pull back $f$ and $g$ via the projection map $\\pi: T^{*}Q \\to T^{*}(Q/G)$. Let's denote these pulled-back functions by $F$ and $G$.\n$$\nF(x,y,z,p_{x},p_{y},p_{z}) = x^{2}\n$$\n$$\nG(x,y,z,p_{x},p_{y},p_{z}) = \\frac{1}{2}p_{x}^{2}\n$$\nThese functions are clearly $G$-invariant as they do not depend on $y$ or $z$.\n\nThe reduced Poisson bracket is defined by the property that $\\{f,g\\}_{\\mathrm{red}} \\circ \\pi_{red} = \\{F,G\\}|_{J^{-1}(0)}$, where $\\pi_{red}: J^{-1}(0) \\to J^{-1}(0)/G$ is the quotient projection. We compute $\\{F,G\\}$ on $T^*Q$ using the canonical Poisson bracket structure:\n$$\n\\{F,G\\} = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial p_{x}} + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial p_{y}} + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial p_{z}} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p_{x}}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p_{y}}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p_{z}}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial z}\n$$\nThe necessary partial derivatives are:\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 2x$, $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial p_{x}} = 0$, and all other partials of $F$ are zero.\n$\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial p_{x}} = p_{x}$, $\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x} = 0$, and all other partials of $G$ are zero.\nPlugging these into the bracket formula:\n$$\n\\{F,G\\} = (2x)(p_{x}) + (0)(0) + (0)(0) - (0)(0) - (0)(0) - (0)(0) = 2xp_{x}\n$$\nThe result is the function $2xp_{x}$ on $T^{*}Q$. Now we restrict this function to the level set $J^{-1}(0)$. Since the expression $2xp_{x}$ does not depend on $p_{y}$ or $p_{z}$, its restriction to $J^{-1}(0)$ is still $2xp_{x}$.\nThis function is constant on the orbits of $G$ in $J^{-1}(0)$, as it only depends on $x$ and $p_{x}$ which are invariant along these orbits. Therefore, it descends to a well-defined function on the quotient space $J^{-1}(0)/G \\cong T^{*}\\mathbb{R}$. In the coordinates $(x,p_{x})$ of the reduced space, this function is simply $2xp_x$.\nThis gives the reduced Poisson bracket:\n$$\n\\{f,g\\}_{\\mathrm{red}}(x,p_{x}) = 2xp_{x}\n$$\nThe problem also asks to compare this with the canonical Poisson bracket on $T^{*}(Q/G) \\cong T^{*}\\mathbb{R}$. The canonical bracket on $T^{*}\\mathbb{R}$ with coordinates $(x,p_{x})$ is given by:\n$$\n\\{f,g\\}_{T^{*}\\mathbb{R}} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p_{x}} - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_{x}}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}\n$$\nFor $f(x,p_{x})=x^{2}$ and $g(x,p_{x})=\\frac{1}{2}p_{x}^{2}$, the partial derivatives are:\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x$, $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_{x}} = 0$.\n$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = 0$, $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p_{x}} = p_{x}$.\n$$\n\\{f,g\\}_{T^{*}\\mathbb{R}} = (2x)(p_{x}) - (0)(0) = 2xp_{x}\n$$\nThe result $2xp_{x}$ from descending the bracket from $T^{*}Q$ is identical to the canonical bracket on the reduced space $T^{*}\\mathbb{R}$. This confirms the consistency of the Marsden-Weinstein reduction procedure for this example. The final answer is the computed expression for the reduced bracket.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of a reduced Poisson bracket on a symplectically reduced space obtained via cotangent bundle reduction in stages for the action of $G=\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ on $Q^{\\circ}=\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the setting. The configuration space is $Q^{\\circ}=\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}$, which is naturally described by polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ where $r \\in (0, \\infty)$ and $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The group $G=\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ acts on $Q^{\\circ}$ by rotation: for an element of $G$ corresponding to an angle $\\phi$, the action is $(r, \\theta) \\mapsto (r, \\theta+\\phi)$. This action is free and proper. The Lie algebra is $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{so}(2) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$. We choose a basis element $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ corresponding to $1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The infinitesimal generator of the action on $Q^{\\circ}$ corresponding to $\\xi$ is the vector field $\\xi_{Q^{\\circ}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}$.\n\nThe phase space is the cotangent bundle $T^{*}Q^{\\circ}$, with canonical local coordinates $(r, \\theta, p_r, p_\\theta)$. The canonical one-form is $\\Theta = p_r dr + p_\\theta d\\theta$, and the canonical symplectic two-form is $\\omega = d\\Theta = dp_r \\wedge dr + dp_\\theta \\wedge d\\theta$. This form gives the standard Poisson brackets $\\{r, p_r\\} = 1$ and $\\{\\theta, p_\\theta\\} = 1$.\n\nThe momentum map $J: T^{*}Q^{\\circ} \\to \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$ for a cotangent-lifted action is defined by the pairing $\\langle J(\\alpha_q), \\xi \\rangle = \\langle \\alpha_q, \\xi_{Q^{\\circ}}(q) \\rangle$ for a covector $\\alpha_q \\in T_q^{*}Q^{\\circ}$. With $\\alpha_q = p_r dr + p_\\theta d\\theta$ and $\\xi_{Q^{\\circ}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}$, we have $\\langle J(r, \\theta, p_r, p_\\theta), \\xi \\rangle = (p_r dr + p_\\theta d\\theta)(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}) = p_\\theta$. Identifying $\\mathfrak{g}^{*}$ with $\\mathbb{R}$, the momentum map is $J = p_\\theta$, as stated in the problem.\n\nWe perform reduction at a regular value $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $\\mu \\neq 0$. The level set of the momentum map is $J^{-1}(\\mu) = \\{(r, \\theta, p_r, p_\\theta) \\in T^{*}Q^{\\circ} \\mid p_\\theta = \\mu\\}$. Since $G=\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ is abelian, the coadjoint action is trivial, and the isotropy subgroup $G_\\mu$ for any $\\mu$ is $G$ itself. The reduced space is $P_\\mu = J^{-1}(\\mu)/G$.\n\nThe problem directs us to use the formalism of reduction in stages, employing a connection on the principal bundle $\\pi: Q^{\\circ} \\to Q^{\\circ}/G$. The base space is the space of orbits, $Q^{\\circ}/G$, which is identified with the set of radii $(0, \\infty)$ coordinatized by $r$. The projection is $\\pi(r, \\theta) = r$. The reduced phase space $P_\\mu$ can be identified with a bundle over $T^{*}(Q^{\\circ}/G)$, and its symplectic form $\\omega_\\mu$ is determined by the minimal coupling procedure. The general formula for the reduced symplectic form on $T^{*}(Q^{\\circ}/G)$, whose elements are denoted $(r, p_r)$, is\n$$\n\\omega_\\mu = \\omega_{Q/G} - \\langle \\mu, \\mathcal{B} \\rangle\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_{Q/G} = dp_r \\wedge dr$ is the canonical symplectic form on $T^{*}(Q^{\\circ}/G)$, and $\\mathcal{B}$ is the curvature two-form of the chosen connection pulled back to $T^*(Q/G)$. The term $\\langle \\mu, \\mathcal{B} \\rangle$ represents the \"magnetic\" or \"twist\" term.\n\nA critical observation is that the base manifold $Q^{\\circ}/G \\cong (0, \\infty)$ is one-dimensional. A two-form on a one-dimensional manifold, such as $\\mathcal{B}$, must be identically zero. Therefore, irrespective of the choice of connection, the curvature term $\\langle \\mu, \\mathcal{B} \\rangle$ must vanish. This provides a direct path to the solution.\n\nFor completeness, we will explicitly compute the curvature for the specified mechanical connection. The metric on $Q^{\\circ}$ inherited from the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is $ds^2 = dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2$. The mechanical connection defines the horizontal subspace $H_q$ at a point $q \\in Q^{\\circ}$ as the orthogonal complement of the vertical subspace $V_q = \\mathrm{span}\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}\\}$ with respect to this metric. The basis vectors $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}$ are orthogonal with respect to the given metric. Thus, the horizontal space is $H_q = \\mathrm{span}\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\}$.\n\nThe connection one-form $\\mathcal{A}$ is a $\\mathfrak{g}$-valued one-form on $Q^{\\circ}$. It is defined by the conditions that it annihilates horizontal vectors and its value on the infinitesimal generator $\\xi_{Q^{\\circ}}$ is $\\xi$. Using our identification $\\mathfrak{g} \\cong \\mathbb{R}$ with generator $\\xi=1$, we have:\n$1.$ $\\mathcal{A}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}) = 0$, since $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}$ is horizontal.\n$2.$ $\\mathcal{A}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}) = 1$, since $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}$ is the generator $\\xi_{Q^{\\circ}}$.\nThese two conditions uniquely determine the connection one-form as $\\mathcal{A} = d\\theta$.\n\nThe curvature of the connection is given by the $\\mathfrak{g}$-valued two-form $\\pi^*\\mathcal{B} = d\\mathcal{A} + \\frac{1}{2}[\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{A}]$. Since $G=\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ is abelian, its Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is abelian, so the Lie bracket term $[\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{A}]$ vanishes. The curvature is simply $\\pi^*\\mathcal{B} = d\\mathcal{A}$.\nWe compute the exterior derivative of the connection form:\n$$\n\\pi^*\\mathcal{B} = d(d\\theta) = 0\n$$\nWhile $\\theta$ is not a globally defined function on $Q^{\\circ}$, $d\\theta$ is a well-defined (though not exact) one-form on $Q^{\\circ}$. As a one-form, it is closed, meaning its exterior derivative is zero. Thus, the curvature $\\mathcal{B}$ of the mechanical connection is zero.\n\nBoth lines of reasoning—the dimensional argument and the explicit calculation—confirm that $\\mathcal{B} = 0$. Consequently, the magnetic term vanishes, and the reduced symplectic form is identical to the canonical one:\n$$\n\\omega_\\mu = \\omega_{Q/G} = dp_r \\wedge dr\n$$\nThe reduced symplectic form shows no dependence on $\\mu$. The Poisson bracket is derived from the symplectic form matrix. For $\\omega_\\mu = dp_r \\wedge dr$, written in matrix form for coordinates $(r, p_r)$ as $\\begin{pmatrix} 0  -1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$, the Poisson bracket matrix is its inverse, $\\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ -1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This corresponds to the bracket relation\n$$\n\\{f, g\\}_{\\mathrm{red}, \\mu} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial r}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p_r} - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_r}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial r}\n$$\nWe are asked to compute $\\{r, p_r\\}_{\\mathrm{red, \\mu}}$.

The bracket is not modified by any $\\mu$-dependent twist term, as the curvature of the connection is zero.",

For such a system, the process of reduction in stages (first by the normal subgroup $N$, then by $H$) is equivalent to a single-stage reduction by the full group $G$.\n\nThe reduced phase space is symplectomorphic to the cotangent bundle of the base, $T^*Q$, but endowed with a modified symplectic structure. The canonical one-form on $T^*Q$, let's denote it $\\theta_{can}$, is modified by a \"momentum shift\" one-form $\\alpha_{\\mu}$ pulled back from $Q$. The canonical symplectic two-form $\\omega_{can} = d\\theta_{can}$ is modified by a \"magnetic\" two-form $B_{\\mu}$ pulled back from $Q$.\n\nThe momentum shift one-form $\\alpha_{\\mu}$ on $Q$ is given by the pairing of the total momentum value $\\mu \\in \\mathfrak{g}^*$ with the connection one-form $\\mathcal{A} \\in \\Omega^1(Q, \\mathfrak{g})$:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\mu} = \\langle \\mu, \\mathcal{A} \\rangle\n$$\nThe magnetic two-form $B_{\\mu}$ on $Q$ is given by the pairing of $\\mu$ with the curvature two-form $\\mathbb{B} \\in \\Omega^2(Q, \\mathfrak{g})$:\n$$\nB_{\\mu} = \\langle \\mu, \\mathbb{B} \\rangle\n$$\nwhere the curvature is defined as $\\mathbb{B} = d\\mathcal{A} + \\frac{1}{2}[\\mathcal{A} \\wedge \\mathcal{A}]$.\n\nFirst, we assemble the total connection $\\mathcal{A}$ and the total momentum value $\\mu$. The connection is given as a sum of its $\\mathfrak{n}$- and $\\mathfrak{h}$-components: $\\mathcal{A} = A^N + A^H$.\n$$\nA^{N}(x,y) = a x dy \\mathbf{t}_{x} + a y dx \\mathbf{t}_{y}\n$$\n$$\nA^{H}(x,y) = \\alpha (x dy - y dx) \\mathbf{r}\n$$\nThus, the total connection one-form on $Q$ is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A} = (a y \\mathbf{t}_{y} - \\alpha y \\mathbf{r}) dx + (a x \\mathbf{t}_{x} + \\alpha x \\mathbf{r}) dy\n$$\nThe total momentum value $\\mu \\in \\mathfrak{g}^*$ is the sum of the components in $\\mathfrak{n}^*$ and $\\mathfrak{h}^*$.\n$$\n\\mu = \\nu_N + \\nu_H = \\eta_x \\mathbf{t}_x^* + \\eta_y \\mathbf{t}_y^* + \\ell \\mathbf{r}^*\n$$\nThe pairing between $\\mathfrak{g}^*$ and $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined by $\\langle \\mathbf{t}_i^*, \\mathbf{t}_j \\rangle = \\delta_{ij}$, $\\langle \\mathbf{t}_i^*, \\mathbf{r} \\rangle = 0$, $\\langle \\mathbf{r}^*, \\mathbf{t}_j \\rangle = 0$, and $\\langle \\mathbf{r}^*, \\mathbf{r} \\rangle = 1$.\n\nWe now compute the momentum shift one-form $\\alpha_{\\mu}$:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\mu} = \\langle \\mu, \\mathcal{A} \\rangle = \\langle \\eta_x \\mathbf{t}_x^* + \\eta_y \\mathbf{t}_y^* + \\ell \\mathbf{r}^*, (a y \\mathbf{t}_{y} - \\alpha y \\mathbf{r}) dx + (a x \\mathbf{t}_{x} + \\alpha x \\mathbf{r}) dy \\rangle\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\mu} = \\eta_x \\langle \\mathbf{t}_x^*, a x \\mathbf{t}_x \\rangle dy + \\eta_y \\langle \\mathbf{t}_y^*, a y \\mathbf{t}_y \\rangle dx + \\ell \\langle \\mathbf{r}^*, -\\alpha y \\mathbf{r} \\rangle dx + \\ell \\langle \\mathbf{r}^*, \\alpha x \\mathbf{r} \\rangle dy\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\mu} = a \\eta_x x dy + a \\eta_y y dx - \\alpha \\ell y dx + \\alpha \\ell x dy\n$$\nGrouping terms by $dx$ and $dy$:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\mu} = (a \\eta_y y - \\alpha \\ell y) dx + (a \\eta_x x + \\alpha \\ell x) dy = y(a \\eta_y - \\alpha \\ell) dx + x(a \\eta_x + \\alpha \\ell) dy\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the magnetic two-form $B_{\\mu}$. This requires the curvature $\\mathbb{B}$. We can write $\\mathcal{A} = \\mathcal{A}_x dx + \\mathcal{A}_y dy$ with $\\mathcal{A}_x = a y \\mathbf{t}_y - \\alpha y \\mathbf{r}$ and $\\mathcal{A}_y = a x \\mathbf{t}_x + \\alpha x \\mathbf{r}$.\nThe exterior derivative term is $d\\mathcal{A} = (\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{A}_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{A}_x}{\\partial y}) dx \\wedge dy$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{A}_y}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(a x \\mathbf{t}_x + \\alpha x \\mathbf{r}) = a \\mathbf{t}_x + \\alpha \\mathbf{r}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{A}_x}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(a y \\mathbf{t}_y - \\alpha y \\mathbf{r}) = a \\mathbf{t}_y - \\alpha \\mathbf{r}\n$$\n$$\nd\\mathcal{A} = ( (a \\mathbf{t}_x + \\alpha \\mathbf{r}) - (a \\mathbf{t}_y - \\alpha \\mathbf{r}) ) dx \\wedge dy = (a \\mathbf{t}_x - a \\mathbf{t}_y + 2\\alpha \\mathbf{r}) dx \\wedge dy\n$$\nThe bracket term is $\\frac{1}{2}[\\mathcal{A} \\wedge \\mathcal{A}] = [\\mathcal{A}_x, \\mathcal{A}_y] dx \\wedge dy$.\n$$\n[\\mathcal{A}_x, \\mathcal{A}_y] = [a y \\mathbf{t}_y - \\alpha y \\mathbf{r}, a x \\mathbf{t}_x + \\alpha x \\mathbf{r}]\n$$\nUsing the Lie algebra relations $[\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{t}_x] = \\mathbf{t}_y$, $[\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{t}_y] = -\\mathbf{t}_x$, $[\\mathbf{t}_x, \\mathbf{t}_y] = 0$:\n$$\n[\\mathcal{A}_x, \\mathcal{A}_y] = a^2 xy [\\mathbf{t}_y, \\mathbf{t}_x] + a\\alpha xy [\\mathbf{t}_y, \\mathbf{r}] - a\\alpha xy [\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{t}_x] - \\alpha^2 xy [\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{r}]\n$$\n$$\n[\\mathcal{A}_x, \\mathcal{A}_y] = 0 + a\\alpha xy (\\mathbf{t}_x) - a\\alpha xy (\\mathbf{t}_y) - 0 = a\\alpha xy (\\mathbf{t}_x - \\mathbf{t}_y)\n$$\nSo, $\\frac{1}{2}[\\mathcal{A} \\wedge \\mathcal{A}] = a\\alpha xy (\\mathbf{t}_x - \\mathbf{t}_y) dx \\wedge dy$.\nThe total curvature is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{B} = d\\mathcal{A} + \\frac{1}{2}[\\mathcal{A} \\wedge \\mathcal{A}] = (a \\mathbf{t}_x - a \\mathbf{t}_y + 2\\alpha \\mathbf{r}) dx \\wedge dy + a\\alpha xy (\\mathbf{t}_x - \\mathbf{t}_y) dx \\wedge dy\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{B} = [ (a + a\\alpha xy) \\mathbf{t}_x - (a + a\\alpha xy) \\mathbf{t}_y + 2\\alpha \\mathbf{r} ] dx \\wedge dy\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{B} = [ a(1 + \\alpha xy) \\mathbf{t}_x - a(1 + \\alpha xy) \\mathbf{t}_y + 2\\alpha \\mathbf{r} ] dx \\wedge dy\n$$\nFinally, we compute the magnetic two-form $B_{\\mu} = \\langle \\mu, \\mathbb{B} \\rangle$:\n$$\nB_{\\mu} = \\langle \\eta_x \\mathbf{t}_x^* + \\eta_y \\mathbf{t}_y^* + \\ell \\mathbf{r}^*, [ a(1 + \\alpha xy) \\mathbf{t}_x - a(1 + \\alpha xy) \\mathbf{t}_y + 2\\alpha \\mathbf{r} ] dx \\wedge dy \\rangle\n$$\n$$\nB_{\\mu} = [ \\eta_x (a(1 + \\alpha xy)) - \\eta_y (a(1 + \\alpha xy)) + \\ell (2\\alpha) ] dx \\wedge dy\n$$\n$$\nB_{\\mu} = [ a(\\eta_x - \\eta_y)(1 + \\alpha xy) + 2\\alpha\\ell ] dx \\wedge dy\n$$\nThe two requested quantities are the momentum shift one-form $\\alpha_{\\mu}$ and the magnetic two-form $B_{\\mu}$.",
