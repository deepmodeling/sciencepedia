The Darboux–Weinstein splitting theorem asserts that near any point on a symplectic leaf, the Poisson structure locally splits as a product of a symplectic structure on the leaf and a transverse Poisson structure vanishing at the point.\n\nStarting from these foundational facts and definitions, select the single option that correctly and completely characterizes:\n- the induced bracket on $C^{\\infty}(M)$ in terms of $\\pi$,\n- the integrability (Jacobi) condition in terms of the Schouten–Nijenhuis bracket,\n- and the precise local normal form near a point on a symplectic leaf given by the Darboux–Weinstein splitting theorem.\n\nA. A Poisson manifold is a pair $(M,\\pi)$ where $\\pi \\in \\Gamma(\\wedge^{2} TM)$ is a bivector field such that the bilinear operation $\\{f,g\\} := \\pi(df,dg)$ on $C^{\\infty}(M)$ is a biderivation and satisfies the Jacobi identity.

If $x \\in M$ lies on a symplectic leaf of rank $2r$, then there exist local coordinates $(q_{1},\\dots,q_{r},p_{1},\\dots,p_{r},y_{1},\\dots,y_{k})$ around $x$ in which\n$$\n\\pi \\;=\\; \\sum_{i=1}^{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{i}} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{i}} \\;+\\; \\tfrac{1}{2}\\sum_{a,b=1}^{k} c_{ab}(y)\\, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_{a}} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_{b}},\n$$\nwith $c_{ab}(0)=0$ and $c_{ab}$ independent of the leaf coordinates $(q_{i},p_{i})$.\n\nB. A Poisson manifold is a pair $(M,\\pi)$ with a bivector $\\pi$ for which the bracket is defined by $\\{f,g\\} := \\tfrac{1}{2}\\langle df \\wedge dg,\\pi\\rangle$, and integrability means $[\\pi,\\pi]_{\\mathrm{SN}}=0$ if and only if $d\\pi=0$, where $d$ is the de Rham differential. The Darboux–Weinstein splitting theorem then implies that in suitable local coordinates the transverse Poisson structure vanishes identically so that $\\pi = \\sum_{i=1}^{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{i}} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{i}}$.\n\nC. For a Poisson manifold $(M,\\pi)$, the Hamiltonian vector field is defined by $X_{f} := \\pi^{\\sharp}(df)$ and the bracket by $\\{f,g\\} := X_{f}(g)$; the Jacobi identity is equivalent to the vanishing of the Lie derivative $\\mathcal{L}_{X_{f}}\\pi=0$ for some nonzero $f$ near the point.

            "solution": "The problem statement poses a question in the field of differential geometry, specifically concerning Poisson manifolds. It asks to identify the option that correctly and completely characterizes three fundamental aspects of this theory: the definition of the Poisson bracket in terms of the Poisson bivector, the integrability condition for this bracket, and the local structure given by the Darboux–Weinstein splitting theorem.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem provides the following conceptual background:\n- A smooth manifold $M$ equipped with a bivector field $\\pi \\in \\Gamma(\\wedge^{2} TM)$.\n- A bilinear operation on $C^{\\infty}(M)$ is induced by contracting $\\pi$ with differentials.\n- The Schouten–Nijenhuis bracket gives a coordinate-free expression for the integrability condition (i.e., the Jacobi identity) for this bilinear operation.\n- The Darboux–Weinstein splitting theorem describes the local structure of the Poisson bivector near a point on a symplectic leaf, stating it splits into a product of a symplectic structure on the leaf and a transverse Poisson structure vanishing at the point.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is a well-posed question designed to test knowledge of the mathematical theory of Poisson manifolds.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The premises are foundational concepts and theorems in Poisson geometry. The definitions of the Poisson bracket from a bivector, the role of the Schouten–Nijenhuis bracket, and the statement of the Darboux-Weinstein theorem are all standard, established parts of the field.\n- **Well-Posed**: The task is clear: to select the option that correctly formulates these three concepts. The problem is self-contained within the context of established mathematical theory.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise and formal, as is typical for mathematics.\n\nThe problem statement is free from scientific or factual unsoundness, is formalizable, complete, and well-structured. It is a valid problem in advanced mathematics.\n\n### Step 3: Proceed to Solution\n\nI will now evaluate each of the three required characterizations and then analyze the given options.\n\n1.  **The Induced Bracket on $C^{\\infty}(M)$**: A bivector field $\\pi \\in \\Gamma(\\wedge^2 TM)$ is a section of the second exterior power of the tangent bundle. It can be viewed at each point $x \\in M$ as a skew-symmetric bilinear map on the cotangent space $T_x^*M$. For two smooth functions $f, g \\in C^{\\infty}(M)$, their differentials $df$ and $dg$ are sections of the cotangent bundle $T^*M$. The most natural \"contraction\" as described in the problem is to evaluate $\\pi$ on the pair of one-forms $(df, dg)$. This defines the Poisson bracket:\n    $$\n    \\{f, g\\} := \\pi(df, dg)\n    $$\n    In local coordinates $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$, if $\\pi = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j} \\pi^{ij}(x) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}$, then the bracket is $\\{f,g\\} = \\sum_{i,j} \\pi^{ij} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^i} \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x^j}$. For this operation to define a Lie algebra structure on $C^{\\infty}(M)$, it must be skew-symmetric (which is guaranteed by $\\pi$ being a bivector) and satisfy the Jacobi identity. It must also satisfy the Leibniz rule (i.e., be a biderivation), which is also a direct consequence of the definition.\n\n2.  **The Integrability (Jacobi) Condition**: The Jacobi identity for the bracket $\\{ \\cdot, \\cdot \\}$ is the condition\n    $$\n    \\{\\{f,g\\},h\\} + \\{\\{g,h\\},f\\} + \\{\\{h,f\\},g\\} = 0 \\quad \\forall f,g,h \\in C^{\\infty}(M)\n    $$\n    A fundamental theorem by Lichnerowicz (1977) states that this identity holds if and only if the Schouten–Nijenhuis bracket of the bivector $\\pi$ with itself vanishes:\n    $$\n    [\\pi, \\pi]_{\\mathrm{SN}} = 0\n    $$\n    The Schouten–Nijenhuis bracket is a graded Lie bracket on the space of multivector fields. For a $k$-vector field $A$ and an $l$-vector field $B$, $[A,B]_{\\mathrm{SN}}$ is a $(k+l-1)$-vector field. For two vector fields ($k=l=1$), it coincides with the usual Lie bracket of vector fields. For $\\pi$, a $2$-vector field, $[\\pi, \\pi]_{\\mathrm{SN}}$ is a $3$-vector field, and its vanishing is equivalent to the Jacobi identity.\n\n3.  **The Darboux–Weinstein Splitting Theorem**: This theorem describes the local structure of a Poisson manifold around a point $x_0 \\in M$. The manifold $M$ is foliated by symplectic leaves. Let $S$ be the symplectic leaf passing through $x_0$, and let its dimension be $2r$ (the rank of $\\pi$ at $x_0$ is $2r$). The dimension of $M$ is $n = 2r+k$. The theorem (Weinstein, 1983) states that there exist local coordinates $(U, \\phi)$ centered at $x_0$ (so $\\phi(x_0)=0$), which can be written as $(q_1, \\dots, q_r, p_1, \\dots, p_r, y_1, \\dots, y_k)$, such that in these coordinates the Poisson bivector $\\pi$ takes the form:\n    $$\n    \\pi = \\sum_{i=1}^{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{i}} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{i}} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{a,b=1}^{k} c_{ab}(y) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_{a}} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_{b}}\n    $$\n    The key features of this normal form are:\n    - The first term represents the canonical symplectic structure on the leaf $S$ (locally identified with the $(q,p)$-space).\n    - The second term is the \"transverse Poisson structure\". Crucially, its coefficients $c_{ab}$ depend *only* on the transverse coordinates $y = (y_1, \\dots, y_k)$.\n    - The transverse structure \"vanishes at the point\" $x_0$, which corresponds to $y=0$. This means $c_{ab}(0) = 0$.\n    - The second term itself defines a Poisson structure on the $k$-dimensional transverse space, which means the bivector $\\pi_{\\text{transverse}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum c_{ab}(y) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_a} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_b}$ satisfies $[\\pi_{\\text{transverse}}, \\pi_{\\text{transverse}}]_{\\mathrm{SN}} = 0$.\n\nWith these points established, I will now analyze the options.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.** This option states:\n- Bracket: $\\{f,g\\} := \\pi(df,dg)$. This is the standard correct definition.\n- Integrability: $[\\pi,\\pi]_{\\mathrm{SN}}=0$. This is the correct condition.\n- Darboux–Weinstein form: $\\pi = \\sum_{i=1}^{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{i}} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{i}} + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\sum_{a,b=1}^{k} c_{ab}(y)\\, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_{a}} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_{b}}$, with $c_{ab}(0)=0$ and $c_{ab}$ being independent of $(q_i, p_i)$. This is the precise and correct statement of the Darboux-Weinstein theorem.\nAll three parts are correct and completely characterized as requested.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B.** This option states:\n- Bracket: $\\{f,g\\} := \\tfrac{1}{2}\\langle df \\wedge dg,\\pi\\rangle$. With standard conventions, this is $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi(df,dg)$, which is a non-standard normalization. This is a minor issue compared to other errors.\n- Integrability: $[\\pi,\\pi]_{\\mathrm{SN}}=0$ if and only if $d\\pi=0$. This is incorrect. $[\\pi,\\pi]_{\\mathrm{SN}}=0$ is the general integrability condition. The expression $d\\pi=0$ is ambiguous; if $d$ is the de Rham differential, it does not act on bivectors. This equivalence only holds in the special case of a non-degenerate Poisson structure (a symplectic structure), where $\\pi = \\omega^{-1}$ and the condition becomes $d\\omega=0$. It is not true for a general Poisson structure.\n- Darboux–Weinstein form: The transverse Poisson structure vanishes identically. This is incorrect. The theorem only guarantees that the transverse structure vanishes *at the point* ($c_{ab}(0)=0$), not in a neighborhood of the point.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C.** This option states:\n- Bracket: Defined via the Hamiltonian vector field $X_{f} := \\pi^{\\sharp}(df)$ as $\\{f,g\\} := X_{f}(g)$. This is an equivalent and correct definition, as $X_f(g) = dg(X_f) = \\pi(df, dg)$.\n- Integrability: Equivalent to $\\mathcal{L}_{X_{f}}\\pi=0$ for *some* nonzero $f$. This is incorrect. The property $\\mathcal{L}_{X_{f}}\\pi=0$ (meaning the Hamiltonian flow of $f$ preserves the Poisson structure) is a consequence of the Jacobi identity and holds for *all* smooth functions $f$, not just \"some\". Framing it as the fundamental condition for \"some\" $f$ is a misrepresentation. The actual condition is $[\\pi,\\pi]_{\\mathrm{SN}}=0$.\n- Darboux–Weinstein form: The coefficients $c_{ab}$ may depend on the leaf coordinates $(q,p,y)$. This is incorrect. A crucial conclusion of the theorem is the *splitting* of the structure, which means the transverse coefficients $c_{ab}$ depend *only* on the transverse coordinates $y$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D.** This option states:\n- Bracket: $\\{f,g\\} := \\pi(df,dg)$. Correct.\n- Integrability: $[\\pi,\\pi]_{\\mathrm{SN}}=0$. Correct.\n- Darboux–Weinstein form: It correctly states the form of $\\pi$ and the condition $c_{ab}(0)=0$. However, it adds the condition that all first derivatives $\\frac{\\partial c_{ab}}{\\partial y_{c}}(0)=0$. This is not part of the standard Darboux-Weinstein theorem and is not true in general. For example, a Lie-Poisson structure on the dual of a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}^*$ provides a counterexample where the coefficients are linear in the coordinates, so $c_{ab}(0)=0$ but their first derivatives are non-zero constants (the structure constants of the Lie algebra). This additional requirement is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the detailed analysis, only Option A provides a characterization that is both correct and complete across all three specified aspects of Poisson geometry.",

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in symplectic geometry that tests fundamental concepts and their interplay with a major theorem.\n\nLet the given manifold be $M = \\mathbb{R}^{2n} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ with the symplectic form $\\Omega = \\pi_{1}^{*}\\omega_{0} - \\pi_{2}^{*}\\omega_{0}$. Here, $(\\mathbb{R}^{2n}, \\omega_0)$ is the standard symplectic vector space, and $\\pi_1, \\pi_2$ are the canonical projections. The submanifold in question is the graph of a symplectic linear map $A \\in \\mathrm{Sp}(2n, \\mathbb{R})$, denoted $\\Gamma_{A} = \\{(x, Ax) \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2n}\\}$. We choose an arbitrary point $p = (x_0, Ax_0) \\in \\Gamma_A$. The tangent space to $M$ at any point can be identified with the vector space $\\mathbb{R}^{2n} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. The symplectic form $\\Omega$ at any point $p \\in M$ acts on tangent vectors $u = (u_1, u_2)$ and $v = (v_1, v_2)$ as $\\Omega_p(u,v) = \\omega_0(u_1, v_1) - \\omega_0(u_2, v_2)$, where the subscript on $\\omega_0$ can be dropped as it is a constant form on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$.\n\n**Step 1: Compute the tangent space $T_{p}\\Gamma_{A}$**\n\nThe submanifold $\\Gamma_A$ is the image of the linear map $\\Phi: \\mathbb{R}^{2n} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{2n} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ defined by $\\Phi(x) = (x, Ax)$. Since $\\Phi$ is a linear map, its differential at any point $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ is the map itself, acting on tangent vectors. The tangent space $T_p \\Gamma_A$ is the image of the differential of $\\Phi$ at $x_0$, where $p = \\Phi(x_0)$. A tangent vector $w \\in T_p \\Gamma_A$ is therefore of the form $d\\Phi_{x_0}(v) = (v, Av)$ for some $v \\in T_{x_0}\\mathbb{R}^{2n} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$.\nThus, the tangent space is the subspace\n$$\nT_{p}\\Gamma_{A} = \\{ (v, Av) \\mid v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2n} \\}\n$$\nThis space is independent of the point $p \\in \\Gamma_A$, as $\\Gamma_A$ is a linear subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^{2n} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the symplectic orthogonal $(T_{p}\\Gamma_{A})^{\\Omega}$**\n\nThe symplectic orthogonal of $T_p \\Gamma_A$ is defined as:\n$$\n(T_{p}\\Gamma_{A})^{\\Omega} = \\{ u \\in T_p M \\mid \\Omega_p(u, w) = 0 \\text{ for all } w \\in T_p \\Gamma_A \\}\n$$\nLet $u = (u_1, u_2) \\in T_p M \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{2n} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ be an element of $(T_{p}\\Gamma_{A})^{\\Omega}$.

That is, $\\omega_0(Az, Ay) = \\omega_0(z,y)$ for all $y,z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. Since $A$ is invertible, we can set $z = A^{-1}x$ to get $\\omega_0(x, Ay) = \\omega_0(A^{-1}x, y)$. Applying this property to the second term of our equation gives:\n$$\n\\omega_0(u_2, Av) = \\omega_0(A^{-1}u_2, v)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the condition:\n$$\n\\omega_0(u_1, v) - \\omega_0(A^{-1}u_2, v) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_0(u_1 - A^{-1}u_2, v) = 0\n$$\nSince this must hold for all $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ and the symplectic form $\\omega_0$ is non-degenerate, the first argument must be the zero vector:\n$$\nu_1 - A^{-1}u_2 = 0 \\implies u_1 = A^{-1}u_2 \\implies u_2 = A u_1\n$$\nThis means that a vector $u = (u_1, u_2)$ is in $(T_{p}\\Gamma_{A})^{\\Omega}$ if and only if $u_2 = Au_1$.

The symplectic normal bundle $N^{\\Omega}\\Gamma_{A}$ is thus the zero bundle over $\\Gamma_A$. The rank of this vector bundle, which is the dimension of its fiber, is $0$.\n\n**Explanation of Connection to the Darboux–Weinstein Splitting Theorem**\n\nOur computation shows that the symplectic normal bundle $N^{\\Omega}\\Gamma_{A}$, as defined in the problem, is the zero bundle. This is a direct consequence of $\\Gamma_A$ being a Lagrangian submanifold. The fact that $N^{\\Omega}\\Gamma_{A}$ is trivial is precisely the algebraic signature of a Lagrangian (or coisotropic) submanifold.\n\nThe Darboux–Weinstein theorem describes the local structure of a symplectic manifold in a neighborhood of a submanifold. The specific form of the theorem depends on the type of submanifold.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item For a *symplectic* submanifold $S$, the tangent bundle splits as $TM|_S = TS \\oplus (TS)^\\Omega$, and the neighborhood is modeled on the symplectic normal bundle $(TS)^\\Omega$. This gives a local product structure.\n    \\item For a *Lagrangian* submanifold $L$, such as our $\\Gamma_A$, this splitting does not occur because $TL = (TL)^\\Omega$. The relevant theorem is the **Lagrangian Neighborhood Theorem** (a specialized version of the Darboux-Weinstein theorem). It states that a neighborhood of $L$ in the ambient manifold $(M, \\Omega)$ is symplectomorphic to a neighborhood of the zero section in the **cotangent bundle** $(T^*L, \\omega_{\\mathrm{can}})$, where $\\omega_{\\mathrm{can}}$ is the canonical symplectic form on $T^*L$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe \"local product structure\" mentioned in the problem is provided by this canonical model, the cotangent bundle $T^*\\Gamma_A$. The cotangent bundle $T^*\\Gamma_A$ can be trivialized as $\\Gamma_A \\times (\\mathbb{R}^{2n})^*$, and its fibers (the cotangent spaces $T_p^*\\Gamma_A$) have dimension $\\dim(\\Gamma_A) = 2n$.\n\nTherefore, our computation that the rank of $N^{\\Omega}\\Gamma_{A}$ is $0$ is crucial: it identifies $\\Gamma_A$ as Lagrangian, which in turn dictates that the correct local model is not the (trivial) symplectic normal bundle but the cotangent bundle, whose fibers are non-trivial and have dimension $2n$. The problem, however, asks for the rank of the bundle $N^{\\Omega}\\Gamma_{A}$ itself, which we have unambiguously calculated.\n\nThe rank of the bundle $N^{\\Omega}\\Gamma_{A}$ is the dimension of its fiber, which is the dimension of the vector space $\\{0\\}$.",

The family of symplectic forms is given by $\\omega_{t}=(1+t)\\,\\omega_{0}$, where $\\omega_{0}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}dq_{i}\\wedge dp_{i}$ in the local coordinates $z=\\left(q_{1},\\dots,q_{n},p_{1},\\dots,p_{n}\\right)$.\n\nThe time evolution of the pullback of a time-dependent differential form $\\alpha_t$ by a flow $\\varphi_t$ generated by a time-dependent vector field $X_t$ is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\varphi_{t}^{*}\\alpha_{t}\\right) = \\varphi_{t}^{*}\\left(\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\alpha_{t} + \\frac{d\\alpha_{t}}{dt}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}_{X_t}$ is the Lie derivative with respect to $X_t$, and $\\frac{d\\alpha_{t}}{dt}$ denotes the derivative of the form with respect to the parameter $t$.\n\nThe condition $\\frac{d}{dt}(\\varphi_{t}^{*}\\omega_{t})=0$ implies $\\varphi_{t}^{*}\\left(\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\omega_{t} + \\frac{d\\omega_{t}}{dt}\\right)=0$. Since $\\varphi_{t}$ is a local diffeomorphism for each $t$, its pullback $\\varphi_{t}^{*}$ is an isomorphism on forms. Thus, the condition is equivalent to the vanishing of the form inside the pullback:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\omega_{t} + \\frac{d\\omega_{t}}{dt} = 0\n$$\nWe first compute the time derivative of $\\omega_{t}$. Given $\\omega_{t}=(1+t)\\omega_{0}$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\omega_{t}}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}((1+t)\\omega_{0}) = \\omega_{0}\n$$\nSubstituting this and the expression for $\\omega_t$ into the equation for $X_t$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\left((1+t)\\omega_{0}\\right) + \\omega_{0} = 0\n$$\nSince $(1+t)$ is a scalar function of time only, it is constant with respect to the spatial action of the Lie derivative, so $\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\left((1+t)\\omega_{0}\\right) = (1+t)\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\omega_{0}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n(1+t)\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\omega_{0} + \\omega_{0} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\omega_{0} = -\\frac{1}{1+t}\\omega_{0}\n$$\nWe now use Cartan's homotopy formula, $\\mathcal{L}_{X} = d \\circ \\iota_{X} + \\iota_{X} \\circ d$, where $\\iota_X$ is the interior product. Since $\\omega_0$ is a symplectic form, it is closed, meaning $d\\omega_{0}=0$. The formula simplifies to $\\mathcal{L}_{X_{t}}\\omega_{0} = d(\\iota_{X_{t}}\\omega_{0})$. Our equation for $X_t$ is therefore:\n$$\nd(\\iota_{X_{t}}\\omega_{0}) = -\\frac{1}{1+t}\\omega_{0}\n$$\nLet $\\alpha_{t} = \\iota_{X_{t}}\\omega_{0}$. This is a 1-form we need to determine. The equation is $d\\alpha_{t} = -\\frac{1}{1+t}\\omega_{0}$. To solve for $\\alpha_t$, we seek a 1-form whose exterior derivative is proportional to $\\omega_0$. In the Darboux coordinates, $\\omega_{0}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}dq_{i}\\wedge dp_{i}$. Let us propose a candidate for a primitive of $\\omega_0$. A natural choice is the symmetric 1-form $\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(p_{i}dq_{i} - q_{i}dp_{i})$. Its exterior derivative is:\n$$\nd\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(dp_{i}\\wedge dq_{i} - dq_{i}\\wedge dp_{i}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(-2dq_{i}\\wedge dp_{i}) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{n}dq_{i}\\wedge dp_{i} = -\\omega_{0}\n$$\nSo, $d(-\\theta) = \\omega_0$. We can therefore find a particular solution for $\\alpha_t$ by setting it proportional to $-\\theta$:\n$$\n\\alpha_{t} = c(t)(-\\theta) = -\\frac{c(t)}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(p_{i}dq_{i} - q_{i}dp_{i})\n$$\nTaking the exterior derivative gives $d\\alpha_t = c(t)d(-\\theta) = c(t)\\omega_{0}$. Comparing this with $d\\alpha_{t} = -\\frac{1}{1+t}\\omega_{0}$, we must have $c(t) = -\\frac{1}{1+t}$.\nThus, a solution for the 1-form $\\alpha_t$ is:\n$$\n\\alpha_{t} = \\iota_{X_{t}}\\omega_{0} = \\frac{1}{2(1+t)}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(p_{i}dq_{i} - q_{i}dp_{i})\n$$\nThis choice of primitive for $\\omega_0$ corresponds to the canonical one given by the Poincaré homotopy operator on a star-shaped domain, justifying the uniqueness asserted in the problem statement, assuming the vector field vanishes at the origin of the chart.\n\nNow we determine the vector field $X_t$ from the relation $\\alpha_{t} = \\iota_{X_{t}}\\omega_{0}$. Let the vector field be written in coordinates as $X_{t} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\left(Q_{j}(q,p,t)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{j}} + P_{j}(q,p,t)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{j}}\\right)$. The interior product is:\n$$\n\\iota_{X_{t}}\\omega_{0} = \\iota_{X_{t}}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n}dq_{j}\\wedge dp_{j}\\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\left(\\iota_{X_{t}}(dq_{j})\\wedge dp_{j} - dq_{j}\\wedge \\iota_{X_{t}}(dp_{j})\\right)\n$$\n$$\n= \\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\left(Q_{j}\\,dp_{j} - P_{j}\\,dq_{j}\\right)\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for $\\iota_{X_{t}}\\omega_{0}$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\left(Q_{j}\\,dp_{j} - P_{j}\\,dq_{j}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2(1+t)}\\sum_{j=1}^{n}(p_{j}dq_{j} - q_{j}dp_{j})\n$$\nBy comparing the coefficients of the basis 1-forms $dq_{j}$ and $dp_{j}$ for each $j=1, \\dots, n$, we find:\n- Coefficient of $dp_j$: $Q_j = -\\frac{q_j}{2(1+t)}$\n- Coefficient of $dq_j$: $-P_j = \\frac{p_j}{2(1+t)} \\implies P_j = -\\frac{p_j}{2(1+t)}$\n\nThus, the vector field $X_t$ is:\n$$\nX_{t} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\left(-\\frac{q_{j}}{2(1+t)}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{j}} - \\frac{p_{j}}{2(1+t)}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{j}}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2(1+t)}\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\left(q_{j}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_{j}} + p_{j}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{j}}\\right)\n$$\nTo verify this result as requested, we find the flow $\\varphi_t$ by integrating the ODEs for the coordinates, $\\frac{d\\bar{z}}{dt} = X_t(\\bar{z})$, where $\\bar{z}(t)=\\varphi_t(z_0)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\bar{q}_{j}}{dt} = -\\frac{\\bar{q}_{j}}{2(1+t)}, \\quad \\frac{d\\bar{p}_{j}}{dt} = -\\frac{\\bar{p}_{j}}{2(1+t)}\n$$\nWith the initial condition $\\varphi_0 = \\mathrm{id}$, or $\\bar{z}(0) = z_0$, the solution is $\\bar{q}_j(t) = q_{j,0}(1+t)^{-1/2}$ and $\\bar{p}_j(t) = p_{j,0}(1+t)^{-1/2}$. The flow is a coordinate rescaling:\n$$\n\\varphi_t(q, p) = \\left(\\frac{q}{\\sqrt{1+t}}, \\frac{p}{\\sqrt{1+t}}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, we show that this isotopy satisfies $\\varphi_{t}^{*}\\omega_{t}=\\omega_{0}$. We calculate the pullback of $\\omega_t = (1+t)\\omega_0$:\n$$\n\\varphi_{t}^{*}\\omega_{t} = \\varphi_{t}^{*}\\left((1+t)\\sum_{i=1}^{n}dq_{i}\\wedge dp_{i}\\right) = (1+t)\\sum_{i=1}^{n}d(\\varphi_{t}^{*}q_{i})\\wedge d(\\varphi_{t}^{*}p_{i})\n$$\nThe pulled-back coordinate functions are $q_i \\circ \\varphi_t = \\frac{q_i}{\\sqrt{1+t}}$ and $p_i \\circ \\varphi_t = \\frac{p_i}{\\sqrt{1+t}}$.\n$$\n\\varphi_{t}^{*}\\omega_{t} = (1+t)\\sum_{i=1}^{n}d\\left(\\frac{q_{i}}{\\sqrt{1+t}}\\right)\\wedge d\\left(\\frac{p_{i}}{\\sqrt{1+t}}\\right) = (1+t)\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+t}}dq_{i}\\right)\\wedge\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+t}}dp_{i}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n= (1+t)\\frac{1}{1+t} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} dq_i \\wedge dp_i = \\omega_0\n$$\nSince $\\varphi_{t}^{*}\\omega_{t}=\\omega_{0}$, a constant form, its time derivative is $\\frac{d}{dt}(\\varphi_{t}^{*}\\omega_{t})=0$, satisfying the initial condition. The derived vector field $X_t$ is therefore correct.",
