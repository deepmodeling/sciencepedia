            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of action-angle variables for the one-degree-of-freedom harmonic oscillator, a fundamental and completely integrable system in Hamiltonian mechanics. We are given the Hamiltonian $H(q,p) = \\frac{p^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 q^2$ on the phase space $T^*\\mathbb{R}$ with canonical coordinates $(q,p)$ and symplectic form $\\omega_{\\text{can}} = dq \\wedge dp$.\n\nFirst, we compute the action variable $I(E)$. The action variable is defined by the integral $I(E) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\oint_{H=E} p\\,dq$, where the path of integration is a level set of the Hamiltonian for a fixed energy $E>0$. The level set is described by the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{p^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 q^2 = E\n$$\nThis equation describes an ellipse in the $(q,p)$ phase plane. We can rewrite it in standard form as:\n$$\n\\frac{q^2}{\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{m\\omega^2}}\\right)^2} + \\frac{p^2}{\\left(\\sqrt{2mE}\\right)^2} = 1\n$$\nThe integral is to be taken in the counterclockwise direction. We can evaluate it directly by parameterizing the path. A more direct method is to solve for $p$ as a function of $q$. From the Hamiltonian equation, we have $p(q) = \\pm\\sqrt{2mE - m^2\\omega^2 q^2}$. The extreme values for $q$ are reached when $p=0$, which gives $q_{\\text{max}} = -q_{\\text{min}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{m\\omega^2}}$. The integral is taken over one full period, from $q_{\\text{min}}$ to $q_{\\text{max}}$ along the upper branch ($p>0$) and back from $q_{\\text{max}}$ to $q_{\\text{min}}$ along the lower branch ($p<0$).\n$$\n\\oint_{H=E} p\\,dq = \\int_{-q_{\\text{max}}}^{q_{\\text{max}}} \\sqrt{2mE - m^2\\omega^2 q^2} \\,dq + \\int_{q_{\\text{max}}}^{-q_{\\text{max}}} \\left(-\\sqrt{2mE - m^2\\omega^2 q^2}\\right) \\,dq\n$$\n$$\n\\oint_{H=E} p\\,dq = 2 \\int_{-q_{\\text{max}}}^{q_{\\text{max}}} \\sqrt{2mE - m^2\\omega^2 q^2} \\,dq\n$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we perform a substitution. Let $q = q_{\\text{max}} \\sin\\phi = \\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{m\\omega^2}} \\sin\\phi$. Then $dq = \\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{m\\omega^2}} \\cos\\phi \\,d\\phi$. The limits of integration for $\\phi$ go from $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nThe integrand becomes:\n$$\n\\sqrt{2mE - m^2\\omega^2 \\left(\\frac{2E}{m\\omega^2}\\right) \\sin^2\\phi} = \\sqrt{2mE(1-\\sin^2\\phi)} = \\sqrt{2mE} |\\cos\\phi|\n$$\nSince $\\phi \\in [-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$, $\\cos\\phi \\ge 0$, so $|\\cos\\phi| = \\cos\\phi$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n2 \\int_{-\\frac{\\pi}{2}}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\left( \\sqrt{2mE} \\cos\\phi \\right) \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{m\\omega^2}} \\cos\\phi \\right) \\,d\\phi = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{4mE^2}{m\\omega^2}} \\int_{-\\frac{\\pi}{2}}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\cos^2\\phi \\,d\\phi\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{4E}{\\omega} \\int_{-\\frac{\\pi}{2}}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\frac{1+\\cos(2\\phi)}{2} \\,d\\phi = \\frac{2E}{\\omega} \\left[ \\phi + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(2\\phi) \\right]_{-\\frac{\\pi}{2}}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} = \\frac{2E}{\\omega} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{2\\pi E}{\\omega}\n$$\nThe integral $\\oint p\\,dq$ represents the area enclosed by the elliptical orbit in phase space. The action variable is this area divided by $2\\pi$:\n$$\nI(E) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi E}{\\omega} \\right) = \\frac{E}{\\omega}\n$$\nFrom this relationship, we can express the energy, and thus the Hamiltonian, as a function of the action variable alone: $E = H(I) = \\omega I$.\n\nNext, we construct the angle variable $\\theta(q,p)$, which is canonically conjugate to $I$. We seek a canonical transformation $(q,p) \\to (\\theta, I)$ such that the Hamiltonian becomes a function of $I$ only. A suitable transformation that leads to counterclockwise motion for increasing $\\theta$ is:\n$$\nq(I, \\theta) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2I}{m\\omega}} \\sin\\theta\n$$\n$$\np(I, \\theta) = \\sqrt{2m\\omega I} \\cos\\theta\n$$\nPlugging these into the Hamiltonian confirms our choice:\n$$\nH = \\frac{(\\sqrt{2m\\omega I} \\cos\\theta)^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2I}{m\\omega}} \\sin\\theta\\right)^2 = \\frac{2m\\omega I \\cos^2\\theta}{2m} + \\frac{m\\omega^2 2I}{2m\\omega} \\sin^2\\theta = \\omega I (\\cos^2\\theta + \\sin^2\\theta) = \\omega I\n$$\nTo find the explicit form of $\\theta(q,p)$, we can invert the transformation. From the relations above, we have:\n$$\n\\sin\\theta = q \\sqrt{\\frac{m\\omega}{2I}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\cos\\theta = p \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2m\\omega I}}\n$$\nSubstituting $I = H(q,p)/\\omega = \\frac{1}{\\omega}(\\frac{p^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 q^2)$, we get:\n$$\n\\sin\\theta = \\frac{m\\omega q}{\\sqrt{p^2 + (m\\omega q)^2}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\cos\\theta = \\frac{p}{\\sqrt{p^2 + (m\\omega q)^2}}\n$$\nThese two equations uniquely define the angle variable $\\theta(q,p)$ modulo $2\\pi$ for any $(q,p)$ other than the equilibrium point $(0,0)$. This corresponds to the four-quadrant arctangent function, $\\theta(q,p) = \\mathrm{atan2}(m\\omega q, p)$, where the first argument is proportional to sine and the second to cosine.\n\nWe now verify that the transformation is canonical by showing that the symplectic form is preserved, i.e., $dq \\wedge dp = d\\theta \\wedge dI$. We compute the exterior derivatives of $q$ and $p$:\n$$\ndq = \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial I}dI + \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial \\theta}d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{I}}\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m\\omega}}\\sin\\theta \\,dI + \\sqrt{\\frac{2I}{m\\omega}}\\cos\\theta \\,d\\theta = \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{\\sqrt{2m\\omega I}}dI + \\sqrt{\\frac{2I}{m\\omega}}\\cos\\theta \\,d\\theta\n$$\n$$\ndp = \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial I}dI + \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\theta}d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{I}}\\sqrt{2m\\omega}\\cos\\theta \\,dI - \\sqrt{2m\\omega I}\\sin\\theta \\,d\\theta = \\sqrt{\\frac{m\\omega}{2I}}\\cos\\theta \\,dI - \\sqrt{2m\\omega I}\\sin\\theta \\,d\\theta\n$$\nNow we compute the wedge product $dq \\wedge dp$. Only terms involving $dI \\wedge d\\theta$ and $d\\theta \\wedge dI$ will be non-zero.\n$$\ndq \\wedge dp = \\left( \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{\\sqrt{2m\\omega I}} \\right) \\left( -\\sqrt{2m\\omega I}\\sin\\theta \\right) dI \\wedge d\\theta + \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{2I}{m\\omega}}\\cos\\theta \\right) \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{m\\omega}{2I}}\\cos\\theta \\right) d\\theta \\wedge dI\n$$\n$$\ndq \\wedge dp = (-\\sin^2\\theta) \\, dI \\wedge d\\theta + (\\cos^2\\theta) \\, d\\theta \\wedge dI\n$$\nUsing the anti-commutative property $dI \\wedge d\\theta = -d\\theta \\wedge dI$:\n$$\ndq \\wedge dp = (\\sin^2\\theta) \\, d\\theta \\wedge dI + (\\cos^2\\theta) \\, d\\theta \\wedge dI = (\\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta) \\, d\\theta \\wedge dI = d\\theta \\wedge dI\n$$\nThis confirms that the transformation to $(\\theta, I)$ coordinates is canonical, as it preserves the structure of the symplectic form.\n\nFinally, we analyze the dynamics using Hamilton's equations in the action-angle coordinates. The Hamiltonian is $H(\\theta, I) = \\omega I$. The equations of motion are:\n$$\n\\dot{I} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial \\theta} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}(\\omega I) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{\\theta} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial I} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial I}(\\omega I) = \\omega\n$$\nThe first equation, $\\dot{I}=0$, shows that the action $I$ is a constant of motion, which is consistent with $I$ being a function of the conserved energy $E$. The second equation, $\\dot{\\theta}=\\omega$, shows that the angle variable $\\theta$ evolves linearly with time. Integrating with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\theta(t) = \\omega t + \\theta_0\n$$\nwhere $\\theta_0$ is a constant of integration representing the initial phase. The rate of change of the angle, $\\omega$, is the constant angular frequency of the oscillator. All angles are implicitly in radians as per standard mathematical convention.\nThe problem requests a final expression for $I(E)$. Based on our calculation, this is $I(E) = E/\\omega$.",

A fundamental property of the vector cross product is that the resulting vector $B \\times A$ is orthogonal to both $A$ and $B$. Therefore, the dot product of $A$ with $B \\times A$ must be zero:\n$$\nA \\cdot (B \\times A) = 0\n$$\nIn our case, $A = M$ and $B = \\nabla H(M)$. Applying this identity, we find:\n$$\n\\{H, C\\}(M) = - M \\cdot \\left( \\nabla H(M) \\times M \\right) = 0\n$$\nThus, the Poisson bracket of the Hamiltonian and the Casimir function is identically zero for all $M \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)^{*}$.\n\nNext, we explain why this result, combined with the geometric structure, implies Liouville integrability.\nThe space $\\mathfrak{so}(3)^{*}$ is a $3$-dimensional Poisson manifold. The dynamics of the system unfold on this manifold. The function $C(M)$ is a Casimir invariant, which means it Poisson-commutes with any smooth function $F: \\mathfrak{so}(3)^{*} \\to \\mathbb{R}$. We have just verified this for the specific case $F=H$, but it holds generally because $\\nabla C(M) = M$, so $\\{F, C\\}(M) = -M \\cdot (\\nabla F \\times M) = 0$.\n\nA consequence of $C$ being a Casimir is that the Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$ is tangent to the level sets of $C$. The level sets $C(M) = c$ for constants $c > 0$ are spheres in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. These spheres are the coadjoint orbits of the $SO(3)$ action on $\\mathfrak{so}(3)^*$, and they are the symplectic leaves of the Poisson manifold. Each such sphere is a $2$-dimensional symplectic manifold.\n\nThe Liouville-Arnold theorem states that a Hamiltonian system on a $2n$-dimensional symplectic manifold is completely integrable if there exist $n$ functionally independent conserved quantities (integrals of motion) that are in involution (i.e., their mutual Poisson brackets are all zero).\n\nFor a generic coadjoint orbit (a sphere with radius $\\sqrt{2c}$), the dimension is $2n=2$, which implies $n=1$. We therefore need to find one integral of motion on this $2$-dimensional symplectic manifold. The Hamiltonian $H$ is always an integral of motion for its own flow, since $\\{H, H\\} = 0$. When restricted to a specific coadjoint orbit, $H$ is a smooth function. Since the problem specifies that the moments of inertia $I_1, I_2, I_3$ are distinct, the restriction of $H$ to any sphere $C=c > 0$ is not a constant function. This restricted Hamiltonian, $H|_{C=c}$, serves as the single integral required for Liouville integrability on the $2$-dimensional symplectic leaf. The trajectories of the system are the level curves of $H$ on the sphere.\n\nThe significance of the pair $(H, C)$ is understood on the full $3$-dimensional Poisson manifold $\\mathfrak{so}(3)^{*}$. We have two functions, $H$ and $C$, which satisfy $\\{H, C\\} = 0$. They are functionally independent on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ because their gradients, $\\nabla H = (\\frac{M_1}{I_1}, \\frac{M_2}{I_2}, \\frac{M_3}{I_3})$ and $\\nabla C = (M_1, M_2, M_3)$, are not parallel for generic $M$ (given distinct $I_k$). On a Poisson manifold of dimension $m=3$, the rank of the Poisson tensor is $2$ (away from $M=0$), meaning the dimension of its kernel is $k=1$. The number of integrals required for integrability in this context is $(m+k)/2 = (3+1)/2 = 2$. The functions $H$ and $C$ are precisely these two required independent integrals in involution. Their common level sets, which are the intersections of an ellipsoid (level set of $H$) and a sphere (level set of $C$), are the $1$-dimensional trajectories of the motion. This structure on the ambient $3$-dimensional space ensures that the dynamics restricted to each $2$-dimensional symplectic leaf (coadjoint orbit) is Liouville integrable.",

The partial derivatives of $I_{y}$ are $\\frac{\\partial I_{y}}{\\partial y} = 2\\omega^{2}y$, $\\frac{\\partial I_{y}}{\\partial p_{y}} = 2p_{y}$, and $\\frac{\\partial I_{y}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial I_{y}}{\\partial p_{x}} = 0$.\nThe Poisson bracket $\\{I_{y}, H\\}$ is:\n$$\n\\{I_{y}, H\\} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial I_{y}}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_{x}} - \\frac{\\partial I_{y}}{\\partial p_{x}}\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial I_{y}}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_{y}} - \\frac{\\partial I_{y}}{\\partial p_{y}}\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\{I_{y}, H\\} = (0)(p_{x}) - (0)(\\omega^{2}x) + (2\\omega^{2}y)(p_{y}) - (2p_{y})(\\omega^{2}y) = 2\\omega^{2}yp_{y} - 2\\omega^{2}yp_{y} = 0\n$$\nThus, $I_{y}$ is a constant of motion.\n\n- **Integral $L = xp_{y} - yp_{x}$**:\nThe partial derivatives of $L$ are $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} = p_{y}$, $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} = -p_{x}$, $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial p_{x}} = -y$, $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial p_{y}} = x$.\nThe Poisson bracket $\\{L, H\\}$ is:\n$$\n\\{L, H\\} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_{x}} - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial p_{x}}\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_{y}} - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial p_{y}}\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y}\n$$\n$$\n\\{L, H\\} = (p_{y})(p_{x}) - (-y)(\\omega^{2}x) + (-p_{x})(p_{y}) - (x)(\\omega^{2}y)\n$$\n$$\n\\{L, H\\} = p_{x}p_{y} + \\omega^{2}xy - p_{x}p_{y} - \\omega^{2}xy = 0\n$$\nThus, $L$ is a constant of motion.\n\n**2. Superintegrability**\n\nA Hamiltonian system with $n$ degrees of freedom is called superintegrable if it possesses more than $n$ functionally independent integrals of motion. For the planar harmonic oscillator, the number of degrees of freedom is $n=2$. We have already found three integrals of motion: $I_{x}$, $I_{y}$, and $L$. To demonstrate superintegrability, we must show that these three integrals are functionally independent at a generic point in the phase space $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$.\n\nFunctional independence is established if the gradients of the functions are linearly independent. The gradients are vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$ with components $(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{x}}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{y}})$.\n$$\n\\nabla I_{x} = (2\\omega^{2}x, 0, 2p_{x}, 0)\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla I_{y} = (0, 2\\omega^{2}y, 0, 2p_{y})\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla L = (p_{y}, -p_{x}, -y, x)\n$$\nWe form the Jacobian matrix with these gradients as rows and check its rank:\n$$\nJ = \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\omega^{2}x & 0 & 2p_{x} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2\\omega^{2}y & 0 & 2p_{y} \\\\ p_{y} & -p_{x} & -y & x \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe rank of this $3 \\times 4$ matrix is $3$ if at least one of its $3 \\times 3$ minors is non-zero. Let's compute the determinant of the minor formed by the first, second, and fourth columns:\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\omega^{2}x & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2\\omega^{2}y & 2p_{y} \\\\ p_{y} & -p_{x} & x \\end{pmatrix} = 2\\omega^{2}x \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\omega^{2}y & 2p_{y} \\\\ -p_{x} & x \\end{pmatrix} = 2\\omega^{2}x(2\\omega^{2}xy - (-p_{x})(2p_{y})) = 4\\omega^2 x(\\omega^2 xy + p_x p_y)\n$$\nThis determinant is not identically zero. For instance, if $x \\ne 0$ and all other coordinates are chosen such that $\\omega^{2}xy + p_{x}p_{y} \\ne 0$, the determinant is non-zero. This implies that the three gradient vectors are linearly independent at generic points of the phase space.\n\nSince we have found $3$ functionally independent integrals of motion ($I_{x}, I_{y}, L$) for a system with $n=2$ degrees of freedom, and $3 > 2$, the system is superintegrable.\n\n**3. Mutual Poisson Brackets and Maximal Commuting Subset**\n\nWe now compute the Poisson brackets between the pairs of integrals from the set $\\{I_{x}, I_{y}, L\\}$.\n\n- **Bracket $\\{I_{x}, I_{y}\\}$**:\n$I_x$ depends only on $(x, p_{x})$ and $I_y$ depends only on $(y, p_y)$. The terms in the Poisson bracket formula involve products of derivatives with respect to mismatched variables (e.g., $\\frac{\\partial I_{x}}{\\partial y}$, $\\frac{\\partial I_{y}}{\\partial x}$), which are all zero.\n$$\n\\{I_{x}, I_{y}\\} = \\frac{\\partial I_{x}}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial I_{y}}{\\partial p_{x}} - \\frac{\\partial I_{x}}{\\partial p_{x}}\\frac{\\partial I_{y}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial I_{x}}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial I_{y}}{\\partial p_{y}} - \\frac{\\partial I_{x}}{\\partial p_{y}}\\frac{\\partial I_{y}}{\\partial y} = (2\\omega^{2}x)(0) - (2p_{x})(0) + (0)(2p_{y}) - (0)(2\\omega^{2}y) = 0\n$$\n$I_{x}$ and $I_{y}$ are in involution (they commute).\n\n- **Bracket $\\{I_{x}, L\\}$**:\n$$\n\\{I_{x}, L\\} = \\frac{\\partial I_{x}}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial p_{x}} - \\frac{\\partial I_{x}}{\\partial p_{x}}\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial I_{x}}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial p_{y}} - \\frac{\\partial I_{x}}{\\partial p_{y}}\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y}\n$$\n$$\n\\{I_{x}, L\\} = (2\\omega^{2}x)(-y) - (2p_{x})(p_{y}) + (0)(x) - (0)(-p_{x}) = -2\\omega^{2}xy - 2p_{x}p_{y} = -2(\\omega^{2}xy + p_{x}p_{y})\n$$\n$I_x$ and $L$ do not commute.\n\n- **Bracket $\\{I_{y}, L\\}$**:\n$$\n\\{I_{y}, L\\} = \\frac{\\partial I_{y}}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial p_{x}} - \\frac{\\partial I_{y}}{\\partial p_{x}}\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial I_{y}}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial p_{y}} - \\frac{\\partial I_{y}}{\\partial p_{y}}\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y}\n$$\n$$\n\\{I_{y}, L\\} = (0)(-y) - (0)(p_{y}) + (2\\omega^{2}y)(x) - (2p_{y})(-p_{x}) = 2\\omega^{2}xy + 2p_{x}p_{y} = 2(\\omega^{2}xy + p_{x}p_{y})\n$$\n$I_y$ and $L$ do not commute.\n\nA maximal subset of functionally independent integrals in involution, in the sense of Liouville integrability, is a set of $n=2$ such integrals. From our calculations, the pair $\\{I_x, I_y\\}$ satisfies these conditions:\n1.  **In Involution**: We have shown $\\{I_{x}, I_{y}\\} = 0$.\n2.  **Functionally Independent**: The gradients $\\nabla I_{x} = (2\\omega^{2}x, 0, 2p_{x}, 0)$ and $\\nabla I_{y} = (0, 2\\omega^{2}y, 0, 2p_{y})$ are linearly independent except at the origin, so they are functionally independent at generic points.\n3.  **Maximal for Liouville Integrability**: The set contains $n=2$ integrals, which is the required number for Liouville integrability. It is maximal in the sense that any other integral of motion that commutes with both $I_x$ and $I_y$ must be functionally dependent on them (i.e., a function $f(I_x, I_y)$). Adding such an integral would not increase the number of functionally independent integrals in the set. For instance, the Hamiltonian $H = \\frac{1}{2}(I_x+I_y)$ commutes with both but is functionally dependent. The integral $L$ is functionally independent but does not commute. Therefore, $\\{I_x, I_y\\}$ is a maximal commuting subset for the purpose of demonstrating Liouville integrability.\n\nThe chosen maximal subset of functionally independent integrals in involution is $\\{I_{x}, I_{y}\\}$.",
