            "problem": "Consider a one-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian system on the cotangent bundle $T^{\\ast}\\mathbb{R}$ with canonical coordinates $(q,p)$ and the canonical symplectic form $\\omega=\\mathrm{d}q\\wedge\\mathrm{d}p$. Let $H(q,p)$ be a smooth Hamiltonian such that for each fixed energy $E>0$ the energy level $\\{(q,p)\\mid H(q,p)=E\\}$ is a compact, regular, connected curve that is traversed periodically by the Hamiltonian flow. The Liouville-Arnold theorem asserts the existence of action-angle coordinates in a neighborhood of each such invariant torus; in the one-degree-of-freedom case, the invariant torus is a circle, and the associated action variable $I(E)$ is defined by the integral\n$$\nI(E)=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\oint_{\\gamma_{E}} p\\,\\mathrm{d}q,\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma_{E}$ denotes the periodic orbit at energy $E$ and the integral is taken over one full period with respect to the orientation induced by the Hamiltonian flow. Starting from the definitions of Hamiltonian dynamics, the canonical symplectic form, and the regularity of the energy level, carefully justify that $I(E)$ is well-defined and depends only on $E$ for this one-degree-of-freedom setting.

Your final answer must be a single analytic expression. No rounding is required, and no units should be included in the final expression.",
            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, set within the standard framework of Hamiltonian mechanics. It asks for a justification of the properties of the action variable and a specific calculation for the harmonic oscillator.\n\nThe first part of the task is to justify that the action variable, defined as\n$$\nI(E) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\oint_{\\gamma_{E}} p\\,\\mathrm{d}q,\n$$\nis well-defined and depends only on the energy $E$.\n\nThe integral is a line integral of the one-form $\\theta = p\\,\\mathrm{d}q$ over the path $\\gamma_E$. The path $\\gamma_E$ is the level set of the Hamiltonian, $\\{(q,p) \\in T^{\\ast}\\mathbb{R} \\mid H(q,p)=E\\}$. The problem statement asserts that for a given $E > 0$, this level set is a compact, regular, and connected curve. In a two-dimensional phase space $(q,p)$, this means $\\gamma_E$ is a simple closed curve. The integral is taken over one full period, meaning we integrate exactly once around this closed curve. The orientation of integration is specified to be that induced by the Hamiltonian flow. Since the path of integration is a well-defined closed curve, the line integral $\\oint_{\\gamma_{E}} p\\,\\mathrm{d}q$ is well-defined.\n\nTo show that $I(E)$ depends only on $E$, we observe that the path of integration, $\\gamma_E$, is defined solely by the value of the energy $E$. Since the value of the line integral depends only on the one-form being integrated ($p\\,\\mathrm{d}q$) and the path of integration ($\\gamma_E$), and the one-form is fixed, the value of the integral is a function of the path. As the path is determined by $E$, the integral's value, and therefore $I(E)$, must be a function of $E$ alone.\n\nA more formal justification can be provided using Stokes' theorem. Let $D_E$ be the region in the phase space enclosed by the curve $\\gamma_E$, so that $\\partial D_E = \\gamma_E$. In this one-degree-of-freedom case, $D_E = \\{(q,p) \\mid H(q,p) \\le E\\}$. Stokes' theorem states that for a one-form $\\theta$ and a domain $D$ with boundary $\\partial D$, we have $\\oint_{\\partial D} \\theta = \\iint_{D} \\mathrm{d}\\theta$.\nIn our case, $\\theta = p\\,\\mathrm{d}q$. Its exterior derivative is $\\mathrm{d}\\theta = \\mathrm{d}(p\\,\\mathrm{d}q) = \\mathrm{d}p \\wedge \\mathrm{d}q$.\nThe integral for the action becomes:\n$$\n\\oint_{\\gamma_E} p\\,\\mathrm{d}q = \\iint_{D_E} \\mathrm{d}p \\wedge \\mathrm{d}q.\n$$\nThe standard area element on the $(q,p)$ plane is $\\mathrm{d}A = \\mathrm{d}q \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p$. Thus, $\\mathrm{d}p \\wedge \\mathrm{d}q = - \\mathrm{d}q \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p = -\\mathrm{d}A$. The integral $\\iint_{D_E} \\mathrm{d}q \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p$ gives the area of the region $D_E$, provided the boundary $\\gamma_E$ is oriented counter-clockwise. The orientation of $\\gamma_E$ is specified by the Hamiltonian flow, governed by $\\dot{q} = \\partial H / \\partial p$ and $\\dot{p} = - \\partial H / \\partial q$. For a typical simple mechanical system like the harmonic oscillator, this flow is clockwise. Integrating along a clockwise path is equivalent to negating the integral along a counter-clockwise path. Therefore,\n$$\n\\oint_{\\gamma_E, \\text{flow}} p\\,\\mathrm{d}q = \\text{Area}(D_E).\n$$\nThe area of the region $D_E$ defined by $H(q,p) \\le E$ is manifestly a function of $E$ only. Consequently, $I(E) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\text{Area}(D_E)$ is a well-defined function of $E$.\n\nThe second part of the task is to compute $I(E)$ for the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian:\n$$\nH(q,p) = \\frac{p^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2q^2.\n$$\nThe energy level curve $\\gamma_E$ is given by the equation $H(q,p) = E$, where $E > 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{p^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2q^2 = E.\n$$\nThis equation can be rewritten in the standard form for an ellipse, $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$:\n$$\n\\frac{q^2}{2E / (m\\omega^2)} + \\frac{p^2}{2mE} = 1.\n$$\nThis is an ellipse in the $(q,p)$ phase plane centered at the origin. The semi-axes are:\n$$\na_q = \\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{m\\omega^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2E}}{\\omega\\sqrt{m}}\n$$\n$$\na_p = \\sqrt{2mE}.\n$$\nAs established, the integral $\\oint_{\\gamma_E} p\\,\\mathrm{d}q$ is equal to the area of the region $D_E$ enclosed by the ellipse $\\gamma_E$. The area of an ellipse with semi-axes $a_q$ and $a_p$ is given by $\\pi a_q a_p$.\nCalculating this area:\n$$\n\\text{Area}(D_E) = \\pi \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2E}}{\\omega\\sqrt{m}}\\right) (\\sqrt{2mE}) = \\pi \\frac{\\sqrt{2E}\\sqrt{2mE}}{\\omega\\sqrt{m}} = \\pi \\frac{\\sqrt{4mE^2}}{\\omega\\sqrt{m}} = \\pi \\frac{2E\\sqrt{m}}{\\omega\\sqrt{m}} = \\frac{2\\pi E}{\\omega}.\n$$\nThe action variable $I(E)$ is defined as this area divided by $2\\pi$:\n$$\nI(E) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\text{Area}(D_E) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi E}{\\omega} \\right).\n$$\n$$\nI(E) = \\frac{E}{\\omega}.\n$$\nThis expression gives the action variable for the harmonic oscillator as a function of energy $E$ and the system parameter $\\omega$. The parameter $m$ cancels out of the final expression for the action. This is a characteristic result; the action variable $I$ is related to the energy $E$ through the frequency $\\omega$ of the periodic motion, which is independent of the amplitude for a harmonic oscillator.\nWe can express the energy in terms of the action: $E = I\\omega$. This is a foundational result in the context of quantization, where on promoting $I$ to an operator, its eigenvalues are quantized, leading to quantized energy levels.",

            "solution": "The problem as stated constitutes a valid and well-posed exercise in Hamiltonian mechanics. It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and objective. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe system is a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with a Hamiltonian defined on the phase space $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$ with coordinates $(q_{1},q_{2},p_{1},p_{2})$. The Hamiltonian is given by:\n$$\nH(q,p)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(p_{1}^{2}+\\omega_{1}^{2}q_{1}^{2}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(p_{2}^{2}+\\omega_{2}^{2}q_{2}^{2}\\right)\n$$\nThis Hamiltonian is separable, meaning it can be written as a sum of functions, each depending on a disjoint set of canonical variables. Let $H_{1}(q_{1},p_{1}) = \\frac{1}{2}(p_{1}^{2}+\\omega_{1}^{2}q_{1}^{2})$ and $H_{2}(q_{2},p_{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}(p_{2}^{2}+\\omega_{2}^{2}q_{2}^{2})$. Then $H = H_{1} + H_{2}$.\n\n**1. Complete Integrability and the Liouville-Arnold Theorem**\n\nA Hamiltonian system with $n$ degrees of freedom is completely integrable if it possesses $n$ independent, smooth integrals of motion $F_{1}, \\dots, F_{n}$ that are in involution, i.e., $\\{F_{i}, F_{j}\\} = 0$ for all $i,j$. For our system, $n=2$.\n\nWe propose $F_{1} = H_{1}$ and $F_{2} = H_{2}$ as the two integrals of motion.\nFirst, we verify they are integrals of motion, i.e., they are conserved under the flow of $H$. This means $\\{H_{1}, H\\}=0$ and $\\{H_{2}, H\\}=0$.\nThe Poisson bracket is defined as $\\{f,g\\}=\\sum_{k=1}^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q_{k}}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p_{k}}-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_{k}}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial q_{k}}\\right)$.\nLet us compute $\\{H_{1}, H\\} = \\{H_{1}, H_{1} + H_{2}\\} = \\{H_{1}, H_{1}\\} + \\{H_{1}, H_{2}\\}$.\nThe bracket $\\{H_1, H_1\\}$ is trivially $0$.\nFor $\\{H_{1}, H_{2}\\}$:\n$$\n\\{H_{1}, H_{2}\\} = \\frac{\\partial H_{1}}{\\partial q_{1}}\\frac{\\partial H_{2}}{\\partial p_{1}} - \\frac{\\partial H_{1}}{\\partial p_{1}}\\frac{\\partial H_{2}}{\\partial q_{1}} + \\frac{\\partial H_{1}}{\\partial q_{2}}\\frac{\\partial H_{2}}{\\partial p_{2}} - \\frac{\\partial H_{1}}{\\partial p_{2}}\\frac{\\partial H_{2}}{\\partial q_{2}}\n$$\nSince $H_{1}$ depends only on $(q_{1}, p_{1})$ and $H_{2}$ depends only on $(q_{2}, p_{2})$, all partial derivatives of $H_{1}$ with respect to $q_{2}, p_{2}$ are zero, and all partial derivatives of $H_{2}$ with respect to $q_{1}, p_{1}$ are zero. Thus, every term in the sum is zero, and $\\{H_{1}, H_{2}\\} = 0$.\nIt follows that $\\{H_{1}, H\\} = 0$. A similar calculation shows $\\{H_{2}, H\\} = \\{H_{2}, H_{1} + H_{2}\\} = \\{H_{2}, H_{1}\\} + \\{H_{2}, H_{2}\\} = -\\{H_{1}, H_{2}\\} + 0 = 0$.\nSo, $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ are indeed integrals of motion. They are smooth, globally defined functions on $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$.\n\nNext, we check for independence. Their gradients are $\\mathrm{d}H_{1} = \\omega_{1}^{2}q_{1}\\mathrm{d}q_{1} + p_{1}\\mathrm{d}p_{1}$ and $\\mathrm{d}H_{2} = \\omega_{2}^{2}q_{2}\\mathrm{d}q_{2} + p_{2}\\mathrm{d}p_{2}$. These $1$-forms are linearly independent everywhere except where one or both are zero, which occurs only on the subspaces where $(q_{1}, p_{1}) = (0,0)$ or $(q_{2}, p_{2}) = (0,0)$. Thus, they are independent almost everywhere.\n\nSince we have found $n=2$ independent integrals of motion $(H_{1}, H_{2})$ in involution, the system is completely integrable.\n\nThe Liouville-Arnold theorem applies to the regular level sets of these integrals. For constants $E_{1}>0$ and $E_{2}>0$, the level set $M_{E_{1},E_{2}} = \\{(q,p)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{4} | H_{1}=E_{1}, H_{2}=E_{2}\\}$ is a compact manifold. The equation $H_{i}=E_{i}$ defines a circle (topologically) in the $(q_{i}, p_{i})$ phase plane. The level set $M_{E_{1},E_{2}}$ is the Cartesian product of these two circles, $S^{1} \\times S^{1}$, which is a $2$-torus, $\\mathbb{T}^{2}$. The theorem asserts that there exists a canonical transformation to action-angle coordinates $(J_{1}, J_{2}, \\theta_{1}, \\theta_{2})$ such that the Hamiltonian expressed in these coordinates depends only on the actions, $H=H(J_{1}, J_{2})$, and the Hamiltonian flow is linear on the torus.\n\n**2. Derivation of Action Variables**\n\nThe action variables are defined by $J_{i} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\oint_{\\gamma_{i}}p_{i}\\,\\mathrm{d}q_{i}$. The path of integration $\\gamma_{i}$ is the closed curve in the $(q_{i}, p_{i})$ plane defined by $H_{i} = E_{i} = \\text{const}$.\nThe equation $H_{i}=\\frac{1}{2}(p_{i}^{2}+\\omega_{i}^{2}q_{i}^{2})=E_{i}$ can be written as:\n$$\n\\frac{q_{i}^{2}}{(\\sqrt{2E_{i}}/\\omega_{i})^{2}} + \\frac{p_{i}^{2}}{(\\sqrt{2E_{i}})^{2}} = 1\n$$\nThis is the equation of an ellipse in the $(q_{i}, p_{i})$ plane with semi-axes $a = \\frac{\\sqrt{2E_{i}}}{\\omega_{i}}$ and $b = \\sqrt{2E_{i}}$.\nThe integral $\\oint_{\\gamma_{i}}p_{i}\\,\\mathrm{d}q_{i}$ represents the area enclosed by this ellipse. The area of an ellipse is $\\pi a b$.\nArea $= \\pi \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2E_{i}}}{\\omega_{i}}\\right) (\\sqrt{2E_{i}}) = \\frac{2\\pi E_{i}}{\\omega_{i}}$.\nSubstituting this into the definition of the action variable:\n$$\nJ_{i} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi E_{i}}{\\omega_{i}}\\right) = \\frac{E_{i}}{\\omega_{i}}\n$$\nSince $E_{i}$ is the value of the function $H_{i}$, we can express the action variable as a function on the phase space:\n$$\nJ_{i}(q_{i}, p_{i}) = \\frac{H_{i}}{\\omega_{i}} = \\frac{1}{2\\omega_{i}}(p_{i}^{2} + \\omega_{i}^{2}q_{i}^{2})\n$$\nSo we have $J_{1} = \\frac{1}{2\\omega_{1}}(p_{1}^{2} + \\omega_{1}^{2}q_{1}^{2})$ and $J_{2} = \\frac{1}{2\\omega_{2}}(p_{2}^{2} + \\omega_{2}^{2}q_{2}^{2})$.\n\n**3. Construction of Angle Variables and Canonical Conjugacy**\n\nWe seek angle variables $\\theta_{1}$ and $\\theta_{2}$ that are canonically conjugate to $J_{1}$ and $J_{2}$. A standard way to find them is to propose a canonical transformation that puts the Hamiltonian in the desired form. Consider the transformation for each subsystem:\n$$\nq_{i} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2J_{i}}{\\omega_{i}}}\\sin\\theta_{i}, \\quad p_{i} = \\sqrt{2J_{i}\\omega_{i}}\\cos\\theta_{i}\n$$\nSubstituting these into $H_{i}$ gives $H_{i} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( (2J_{i}\\omega_{i}\\cos^{2}\\theta_{i}) + \\omega_{i}^{2}\\left(\\frac{2J_{i}}{\\omega_{i}}\\sin^{2}\\theta_{i}\\right) \\right) = J_{i}\\omega_{i}(\\cos^{2}\\theta_{i} + \\sin^{2}\\theta_{i}) = J_{i}\\omega_{i}$. This confirms that $H_{i}$ depends only on $J_{i}$.\n\nTo find $\\theta_i$ in terms of $(q_i, p_i)$, we invert the transformation:\n$$\n\\sin\\theta_{i} = \\frac{q_{i}}{\\sqrt{2J_{i}/\\omega_{i}}} = \\frac{q_{i}\\sqrt{\\omega_{i}}}{\\sqrt{2J_{i}\\omega_{i}}}, \\quad \\cos\\theta_{i} = \\frac{p_{i}}{\\sqrt{2J_{i}\\omega_{i}}}\n$$\nTaking the ratio gives:\n$$\n\\tan\\theta_{i} = \\frac{\\sin\\theta_{i}}{\\cos\\theta_{i}} = \\frac{q_{i}\\sqrt{\\omega_{i}}}{p_{i}}\n$$\nThis implies that the angle variable $\\theta_{i}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\theta_{i}(q_{i}, p_{i}) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{i} q_{i}}{p_{i}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere a two-argument arctangent function is implied to correctly determine the angle in all four quadrants of the $(p_{i}, \\omega_{i}q_{i})$ plane, making it well-defined on $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$.\n\nTo verify that $(\\theta_i, J_j)$ are canonical coordinates, we must show $\\{\\theta_{i}, J_{j}\\} = \\delta_{ij}$.\nSince $\\theta_{i}$ depends only on $(q_{i},p_{i})$ and $J_{j}$ depends only on $(q_{j},p_{j})$, for $i \\neq j$, the bracket $\\{\\theta_{i}, J_{j}\\}$ is trivially $0$.\nWe need to calculate $\\{\\theta_{i}, J_{i}\\}$:\nWe have the partial derivatives of $J_{i} = \\frac{1}{2\\omega_{i}}(p_{i}^{2} + \\omega_{i}^{2}q_{i}^{2})$:\n$\\frac{\\partial J_{i}}{\\partial q_{i}} = \\omega_{i} q_{i}$\n$\\frac{\\partial J_{i}}{\\partial p_{i}} = \\frac{p_{i}}{\\omega_{i}}$\nAnd the partial derivatives for $\\theta_{i} = \\arctan(\\omega_{i}q_{i}/p_{i})$:\n$\\frac{\\partial \\theta_{i}}{\\partial q_{i}} = \\frac{1}{1 + (\\omega_{i}q_{i}/p_{i})^{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\omega_{i}}{p_{i}} = \\frac{p_{i}^{2}}{p_{i}^{2} + \\omega_{i}^{2}q_{i}^{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\omega_{i}}{p_{i}} = \\frac{\\omega_{i} p_{i}}{p_{i}^{2} + \\omega_{i}^{2}q_{i}^{2}}$\n$\\frac{\\partial \\theta_{i}}{\\partial p_{i}} = \\frac{1}{1 + (\\omega_{i}q_{i}/p_{i})^{2}} \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{\\omega_{i}q_{i}}{p_{i}^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{p_{i}^{2}}{p_{i}^{2} + \\omega_{i}^{2}q_{i}^{2}} \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{\\omega_{i}q_{i}}{p_{i}^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{-\\omega_{i} q_{i}}{p_{i}^{2} + \\omega_{i}^{2}q_{i}^{2}}$\nNow computing the Poisson bracket:\n$$\n\\{\\theta_{i}, J_{i}\\} = \\frac{\\partial \\theta_{i}}{\\partial q_{i}}\\frac{\\partial J_{i}}{\\partial p_{i}} - \\frac{\\partial \\theta_{i}}{\\partial p_{i}}\\frac{\\partial J_{i}}{\\partial q_{i}}\n$$\n$$\n\\{\\theta_{i}, J_{i}\\} = \\left(\\frac{\\omega_{i} p_{i}}{p_{i}^{2} + \\omega_{i}^{2}q_{i}^{2}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{p_{i}}{\\omega_{i}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{-\\omega_{i} q_{i}}{p_{i}^{2} + \\omega_{i}^{2}q_{i}^{2}}\\right)(\\omega_{i} q_{i})\n$$\n$$\n\\{\\theta_{i}, J_{i}\\} = \\frac{p_{i}^{2}}{p_{i}^{2} + \\omega_{i}^{2}q_{i}^{2}} + \\frac{\\omega_{i}^{2} q_{i}^{2}}{p_{i}^{2} + \\omega_{i}^{2}q_{i}^{2}} = \\frac{p_{i}^{2} + \\omega_{i}^{2}q_{i}^{2}}{p_{i}^{2} + \\omega_{i}^{2}q_{i}^{2}} = 1\n$$\nThus, we have confirmed that $\\{\\theta_{i}, J_{j}\\} = \\delta_{ij}$.\n\n**4. Hamiltonian Flow and Periodicity of Angle Variables**\n\nIn action-angle coordinates, the Hamiltonian is $H = H_{1} + H_{2} = \\omega_{1}J_{1} + \\omega_{2}J_{2}$.\nThe equations of motion for the angle variables are given by Hamilton's equations:\n$$\n\\dot{\\theta}_{i} = \\{\\theta_{i}, H\\} = \\{\\theta_{i}, \\omega_1 J_1 + \\omega_2 J_2\\} = \\omega_1 \\{\\theta_i, J_1\\} + \\omega_2 \\{\\theta_i, J_2\\}\n$$\nUsing the canonical relation $\\{\\theta_{i}, J_{j}\\} = \\delta_{ij}$:\nFor $i=1$: $\\dot{\\theta}_{1} = \\omega_{1}\\{\\theta_{1}, J_{1}\\} + \\omega_{2}\\{\\theta_{1}, J_{2}\\} = \\omega_{1}(1) + \\omega_{2}(0) = \\omega_{1}$.\nFor $i=2$: $\\dot{\\theta}_{2} = \\omega_{1}\\{\\theta_{2}, J_{1}\\} + \\omega_{2}\\{\\theta_{2}, J_{2}\\} = \\omega_{1}(0) + \\omega_{2}(1) = \\omega_{2}$.\nThis shows that the angle variables evolve linearly in time: $\\theta_{i}(t) = \\omega_{i}t + \\theta_{i}(0)$. The frequencies of the angle variables are the frequencies of the oscillators.\n\nThe angle variables $\\theta_{i}$ are $2\\pi$-periodic for two fundamental reasons.\nFirst, from the perspective of the Liouville-Arnold theorem, the angle variables are coordinates on the invariant torus $\\mathbb{T}^{2}$. A torus is topologically a product of circles, $\\mathbb{T}^{2} = S^{1} \\times S^{1}$. Coordinates on a circle are naturally periodic. By convention, this period is taken to be $2\\pi$.\nSecond, we can see this from the original coordinates. The motion for each subsystem $(q_{i}, p_{i})$ is governed by Hamilton's equations for $H_{i}$:\n$\\dot{q}_{i} = \\{q_{i}, H_{i}\\} = \\partial H_{i}/\\partial p_{i} = p_{i}$\n$\\dot{p}_{i} = \\{p_{i}, H_{i}\\} = -\\partial H_{i}/\\partial q_{i} = -\\omega_{i}^{2}q_{i}$\nThis gives the equation of motion for a simple harmonic oscillator: $\\ddot{q}_{i} + \\omega_{i}^{2}q_{i} = 0$. The solution is periodic with period $T_{i} = 2\\pi/\\omega_{i}$. Over one period, the phase point $(q_{i}(t), p_{i}(t))$ traces a complete ellipse and returns to its starting point. During this time $T_{i}$, the corresponding angle variable $\\theta_{i}(t) = \\omega_{i}t + \\theta_{i}(0)$ changes by $\\Delta\\theta_{i} = \\omega_{i}T_{i} = \\omega_{i}(2\\pi/\\omega_{i}) = 2\\pi$. Since the physical state of the subsystem is identical after $\\theta_{i}$ changes by $2\\pi$, the angle variable is a $2\\pi$-periodic coordinate.\n\nThe explicit analytical expressions for the angle variables are therefore:\n$\\theta_{1}(q,p) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{1} q_{1}}{p_{1}}\\right)$\n$\\theta_{2}(q,p) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{2} q_{2}}{p_{2}}\\right)$",

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated to be valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and falls squarely within the domain of geometric mechanics. It presents a standard, solvable problem concerning a completely integrable Hamiltonian system.\n\nWe begin by establishing the properties of the given integrals of motion, $H = \\frac{p_{x}^{2} + p_{y}^{2}}{2m}$ and $I = p_{y}$, on the phase space $T^{\\ast}Q$ with $Q = \\mathbb{R} \\times S^{1}$. The phase space coordinates are $(x, y, p_x, p_y)$.\n\nFirst, we verify that $H$ and $I$ are in involution, i.e., their Poisson bracket $\\{H, I\\}$ is zero. The Poisson bracket of two functions $f$ and $g$ on the phase space is defined as:\n$$\n\\{f, g\\} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q_i} \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p_i} - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_i} \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial q_i} \\right)\n$$\nIn our case, the coordinates are $(q_1, q_2) = (x, y)$ and the conjugate momenta are $(p_1, p_2) = (p_x, p_y)$.\nThe partial derivatives of $H$ and $I$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_x} = \\frac{p_x}{m}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_y} = \\frac{p_y}{m}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial x} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial y} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial p_x} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial p_y} = 1\n$$\nUsing these, the Poisson bracket is:\n$$\n\\{H, I\\} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial p_x} - \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_x}\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial x}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial p_y} - \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_y}\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial y}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\{H, I\\} = \\left( (0)(0) - \\left(\\frac{p_x}{m}\\right)(0) \\right) + \\left( (0)(1) - \\left(\\frac{p_y}{m}\\right)(0) \\right) = 0\n$$\nSince $\\{H, I\\} = 0$ everywhere on $T^{\\ast}Q$, the functions $H$ and $I$ are in involution.\n\nNext, we establish that $H$ and $I$ are functionally independent almost everywhere. We examine their gradients (exterior derivatives) $\\mathrm{d}H$ and $\\mathrm{d}I$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}H = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_x} \\mathrm{d}p_x + \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_y} \\mathrm{d}p_y = \\frac{p_x}{m} \\mathrm{d}p_x + \\frac{p_y}{m} \\mathrm{d}p_y\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}I = \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial p_y} \\mathrm{d}p_y = \\mathrm{d}p_y\n$$\nFunctional independence requires that $\\mathrm{d}H$ and $\\mathrm{d}I$ are linearly independent. We check this by computing their wedge product:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}H \\wedge \\mathrm{d}I = \\left(\\frac{p_x}{m} \\mathrm{d}p_x + \\frac{p_y}{m} \\mathrm{d}p_y\\right) \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p_y = \\frac{p_x}{m} (\\mathrm{d}p_x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p_y) + \\frac{p_y}{m} (\\mathrm{d}p_y \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p_y)\n$$\nSince $\\mathrm{d}p_y \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p_y = 0$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}H \\wedge \\mathrm{d}I = \\frac{p_x}{m} \\mathrm{d}p_x \\wedge \\mathrm{d}p_y\n$$\nThis wedge product is non-zero if and only if $p_x \\neq 0$. The set where $p_x=0$ is a submanifold of codimension $1$, so $H$ and $I$ are functionally independent almost everywhere on $T^{\\ast}Q$.\n\nThe dimension of the phase space is $\\dim(T^{\\ast}Q) = 2 \\times \\dim(Q) = 2 \\times 2 = 4$. We have found two functionally independent integrals in involution, which equals the number of degrees of freedom ($n=2$). Therefore, the system is completely integrable in the sense of Liouville.\n\nWe now analyze the level set $F^{-1}(c)$ for a regular value $c = (E, \\ell)$. The level set is defined by the equations:\n$$\nH = E \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{p_x^2 + p_y^2}{2m} = E\n$$\n$$\nI = \\ell \\quad \\implies \\quad p_y = \\ell\n$$\nSubstituting the second equation into the first yields:\n$$\n\\frac{p_x^2 + \\ell^2}{2m} = E \\quad \\implies \\quad p_x^2 = 2mE - \\ell^2\n$$\nThe problem specifies the condition $E > \\frac{\\ell^2}{2m}$, which ensures that $2mE - \\ell^2 > 0$. This implies that $p_x$ must take one of two distinct, non-zero real values:\n$$\np_x = \\pm \\sqrt{2mE - \\ell^2}\n$$\nThe fact that $p_x \\neq 0$ on this level set confirms that $c=(E, \\ell)$ is a regular value of the map $F = (H,I)$, and the level set $F^{-1}(E, \\ell)$ is a smooth submanifold of $T^{\\ast}Q$ of dimension $4-2=2$.\n\nThe level set $F^{-1}(E, \\ell)$ is the union of two disjoint (and therefore disconnected) components:\n$$\nM_+ = \\{ (x, y, p_x, p_y) \\in T^*Q \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R}, y \\in S^1, p_x = +\\sqrt{2mE - \\ell^2}, p_y = \\ell \\}\n$$\n$$\nM_- = \\{ (x, y, p_x, p_y) \\in T^*Q \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R}, y \\in S^1, p_x = -\\sqrt{2mE - \\ell^2}, p_y = \\ell \\}\n$$\nLet us analyze a single connected component, for instance $M_+$. For any point in $M_+$, the momentum coordinates $(p_x, p_y)$ are fixed. The configuration coordinates $(x,y)$ can be any point in the configuration manifold $Q = \\mathbb{R} \\times S^1$. Thus, there is a natural projection map $\\pi: M_+ \\to Q$ given by $\\pi(x, y, p_x, p_y) = (x, y)$. This map is a bijection, and in fact a diffeomorphism.\nTherefore, each connected component of the level set is diffeomorphic to the configuration space $Q = \\mathbb{R} \\times S^1$.\n\nThe manifold $\\mathbb{R} \\times S^1$ is an infinite cylinder. This directly addresses the geometry and topology of the level set components. The noncompactness arises from the $\\mathbb{R}$ factor, corresponding to the unbounded motion in the $x$ direction. This agrees with the extension of the Liouville-Arnold theorem to non-compact level sets, which states that a connected component of a regular level set of a completely integrable system is diffeomorphic to $T^j \\times \\mathbb{R}^{k-j}$ for some $j \\in \\{0, \\dots, k\\}$, where $k$ is the number of integrals. Here, $k=2$, and our result $\\mathbb{R} \\times S^1 \\cong \\mathbb{R}^1 \\times T^1$ corresponds to the case $j=1$. The invariant manifold is the cylinder itself, on which the commuting Hamiltonian flows of $H$ and $I$ act.\n\nThe final task is to compute the Euler characteristic $\\chi$ of a connected component. Let $M$ be one such component. We have established that $M$ is diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R} \\times S^1$. The Euler characteristic is a topological invariant, so we need to compute $\\chi(\\mathbb{R} \\times S^1)$.\n\nUsing the property that the Euler characteristic is a homotopy invariant, we note that the cylinder $\\mathbb{R} \\times S^1$ is homotopy equivalent to the circle $S^1$. A deformation retraction is given by $h_t: \\mathbb{R} \\times S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R} \\times S^1$, $h_t(x, y) = ((1-t)x, y)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$, which continuously maps the cylinder to the circle $\\{0\\} \\times S^1$.\nTherefore, $\\chi(\\mathbb{R} \\times S^1) = \\chi(S^1)$.\n\nThe Euler characteristic of a circle, $S^1$, is $0$. This can be computed from a cellular decomposition. For example, $S^1$ can be constructed with one $0$-cell (a vertex) and one $1$-cell (an edge connecting the vertex to itself). The Euler characteristic is the alternating sum of the number of cells of each dimension: $\\chi(S^1) = (\\text{number of } 0\\text{-cells}) - (\\text{number of } 1\\text{-cells}) = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n\nAlternatively, using the product formula for the Euler characteristic, $\\chi(A \\times B) = \\chi(A) \\times \\chi(B)$:\n$$\n\\chi(\\mathbb{R} \\times S^1) = \\chi(\\mathbb{R}) \\times \\chi(S^1)\n$$\nThe real line $\\mathbb{R}$ is contractible to a point. A contractible space has the same homotopy type as a point, so its Euler characteristic is $1$. Thus, $\\chi(\\mathbb{R}) = 1$.\nAs established, $\\chi(S^1) = 0$.\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\chi(\\mathbb{R} \\times S^1) = 1 \\times 0 = 0\n$$\nThe Euler characteristic of a connected component of the level set $F^{-1}(E,\\ell)$ is $0$.",
