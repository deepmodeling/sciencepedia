            "solution": "The problem as stated constitutes a valid and well-posed exercise in Hamiltonian mechanics. It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and objective. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe system is a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with a Hamiltonian defined on the phase space $\\mathbb{R}^4$ with coordinates $(q_1, q_2, p_1, p_2)$. The Hamiltonian is given by:\n$$\nH(q,p)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(p_1^2+\\omega_1^2q_1^2\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(p_2^2+\\omega_2^2q_2^2\\right)\n$$\nThis Hamiltonian is separable, meaning it can be written as a sum of functions, each depending on a disjoint set of canonical variables. Let $H_1(q_1, p_1) = \\frac{1}{2}(p_1^2+\\omega_1^2q_1^2)$ and $H_2(q_2, p_2) = \\frac{1}{2}(p_2^2+\\omega_2^2q_2^2)$. Then $H = H_1 + H_2$.\n\n**1. Complete Integrability and the Liouville-Arnold Theorem**\n\nA Hamiltonian system with $n$ degrees of freedom is completely integrable if it possesses $n$ independent, smooth integrals of motion $F_1, \\dots, F_n$ that are in involution, i.e., $\\{F_i, F_j\\} = 0$ for all $i,j$. For our system, $n=2$.\n\nWe propose $F_1 = H_1$ and $F_2 = H_2$ as the two integrals of motion.\nFirst, we verify they are integrals of motion, i.e., they are conserved under the flow of $H$. This means $\\{H_1, H\\}=0$ and $\\{H_2, H\\}=0$.\nThe Poisson bracket is defined as $\\{f,g\\}=\\sum_{k=1}^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q_k}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p_k}-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_k}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial q_k}\\right)$.\nLet us compute $\\{H_1, H\\} = \\{H_1, H_1 + H_2\\} = \\{H_1, H_1\\} + \\{H_1, H_2\\}$.\nThe bracket $\\{H_1, H_1\\}$ is trivially $0$.\nFor $\\{H_1, H_2\\}$:\n$$\n\\{H_1, H_2\\} = \\frac{\\partial H_1}{\\partial q_1}\\frac{\\partial H_2}{\\partial p_1} - \\frac{\\partial H_1}{\\partial p_1}\\frac{\\partial H_2}{\\partial q_1} + \\frac{\\partial H_1}{\\partial q_2}\\frac{\\partial H_2}{\\partial p_2} - \\frac{\\partial H_1}{\\partial p_2}\\frac{\\partial H_2}{\\partial q_2}\n$$\nSince $H_1$ depends only on $(q_1, p_1)$ and $H_2$ depends only on $(q_2, p_2)$, all partial derivatives of $H_1$ with respect to $q_2, p_2$ are zero, and all partial derivatives of $H_2$ with respect to $q_1, p_1$ are zero. Thus, every term in the sum is zero, and $\\{H_1, H_2\\} = 0$.\nIt follows that $\\{H_1, H\\} = 0$. A similar calculation shows $\\{H_2, H\\} = \\{H_2, H_1 + H_2\\} = \\{H_2, H_1\\} + \\{H_2, H_2\\} = -\\{H_1, H_2\\} + 0 = 0$.\nSo, $H_1$ and $H_2$ are indeed integrals of motion. They are smooth, globally defined functions on $\\mathbb{R}^4$.\n\nNext, we check for independence. Their gradients are $\\mathrm{d}H_1 = \\omega_1^2q_1\\mathrm{d}q_1 + p_1\\mathrm{d}p_1$ and $\\mathrm{d}H_2 = \\omega_2^2q_2\\mathrm{d}q_2 + p_2\\mathrm{d}p_2$. These $1$-forms are linearly independent everywhere except where one or both are zero, which occurs only on the subspaces where $(q_1, p_1) = (0,0)$ or $(q_2, p_2) = (0,0)$. Thus, they are independent almost everywhere.\n\nSince we have found $n=2$ independent integrals of motion $(H_1, H_2)$ in involution, the system is completely integrable.\n\nThe Liouville-Arnold theorem applies to the regular level sets of these integrals. For constants $E_1>0$ and $E_2>0$, the level set $M_{E_1,E_2} = \\{(q,p)\\in\\mathbb{R}^4 | H_1=E_1, H_2=E_2\\}$ is a compact manifold. The equation $H_i=E_i$ defines a circle (topologically) in the $(q_i, p_i)$ phase plane. The level set $M_{E_1,E_2}$ is the Cartesian product of these two circles, $S^1 \\times S^1$, which is a $2$-torus, $\\mathbb{T}^2$. The theorem asserts that there exists a canonical transformation to action-angle coordinates $(J_1, J_2, \\theta_1, \\theta_2)$ such that the Hamiltonian expressed in these coordinates depends only on the actions, $H=H(J_1, J_2)$, and the Hamiltonian flow is linear on the torus.\n\n**2. Derivation of Action Variables**\n\nThe action variables are defined by $J_i = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\oint_{\\gamma_i}p_i\\,\\mathrm{d}q_i$. The path of integration $\\gamma_i$ is the closed curve in the $(q_i, p_i)$ plane defined by $H_i = E_i = \\text{const}$.\nThe equation $H_i=\\frac{1}{2}(p_i^2+\\omega_i^2q_i^2)=E_i$ can be written as:\n$$\n\\frac{q_i^2}{(\\sqrt{2E_i}/\\omega_i)^2} + \\frac{p_i^2}{(\\sqrt{2E_i})^2} = 1\n$$\nThis is the equation of an ellipse in the $(q_i, p_i)$ plane with semi-axes $a = \\frac{\\sqrt{2E_i}}{\\omega_i}$ and $b = \\sqrt{2E_i}$.\nThe integral $\\oint_{\\gamma_i}p_i\\,\\mathrm{d}q_i$ represents the area enclosed by this ellipse. The area of an ellipse is $\\pi a b$.\nArea $= \\pi \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2E_i}}{\\omega_i}\\right) (\\sqrt{2E_i}) = \\frac{2\\pi E_i}{\\omega_i}$.\nSubstituting this into the definition of the action variable:\n$$\nJ_i = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi E_i}{\\omega_i}\\right) = \\frac{E_i}{\\omega_i}\n$$\nSince $E_i$ is the value of the function $H_i$, we can express the action variable as a function on the phase space:\n$$\nJ_i(q_i, p_i) = \\frac{H_i}{\\omega_i} = \\frac{1}{2\\omega_i}(p_i^2 + \\omega_i^2q_i^2)\n$$\nSo we have $J_1 = \\frac{1}{2\\omega_1}(p_1^2 + \\omega_1^2q_1^2)$ and $J_2 = \\frac{1}{2\\omega_2}(p_2^2 + \\omega_2^2q_2^2)$.\n\n**3. Construction of Angle Variables and Canonical Conjugacy**\n\nWe seek angle variables $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ that are canonically conjugate to $J_1$ and $J_2$. A standard way to find them is to propose a canonical transformation that puts the Hamiltonian in the desired form. Consider the transformation for each subsystem:\n$$\nq_i = \\sqrt{\\frac{2J_i}{\\omega_i}}\\sin\\theta_i, \\quad p_i = \\sqrt{2J_i\\omega_i}\\cos\\theta_i\n$$\nSubstituting these into $H_i$ gives $H_i = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( (2J_i\\omega_i\\cos^2\\theta_i) + \\omega_i^2\\left(\\frac{2J_i}{\\omega_i}\\sin^2\\theta_i\\right) \\right) = J_i\\omega_i(\\cos^2\\theta_i + \\sin^2\\theta_i) = J_i\\omega_i$. This confirms that $H_i$ depends only on $J_i$.\n\nTo find $\\theta_i$ in terms of $(q_i, p_i)$, we invert the transformation:\n$$\n\\sin\\theta_i = \\frac{q_i}{\\sqrt{2J_i/\\omega_i}} = \\frac{q_i\\sqrt{\\omega_i}}{\\sqrt{2J_i\\omega_i}}, \\quad \\cos\\theta_i = \\frac{p_i}{\\sqrt{2J_i\\omega_i}}\n$$\nTaking the ratio gives:\n$$\n\\tan\\theta_i = \\frac{\\sin\\theta_i}{\\cos\\theta_i} = \\frac{q_i\\sqrt{\\omega_i}}{p_i}\n$$\nThis implies that the angle variable $\\theta_i$ is given by:\n$$\n\\theta_i(q_i, p_i) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\omega_i q_i}{p_i}\\right)\n$$\nwhere a two-argument arctangent function is implied to correctly determine the angle in all four quadrants of the $(p_i, \\omega_i q_i)$ plane, making it well-defined on $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$.\n\nTo verify that $(\\theta_i, J_j)$ are canonical coordinates, we must show $\\{\\theta_i, J_j\\} = \\delta_{ij}$.\nSince $\\theta_i$ depends only on $(q_i, p_i)$ and $J_j$ depends only on $(q_j, p_j)$, for $i \\neq j$, the bracket $\\{\\theta_i, J_j\\}$ is trivially $0$.\nWe need to calculate $\\{\\theta_i, J_i\\}$:\nWe have the partial derivatives of $J_i = \\frac{1}{2\\omega_i}(p_i^2 + \\omega_i^2q_i^2)$:\n$\\frac{\\partial J_i}{\\partial q_i} = \\omega_i q_i$\n$\\frac{\\partial J_i}{\\partial p_i} = \\frac{p_i}{\\omega_i}$\nAnd the partial derivatives for $\\theta_i = \\arctan(\\omega_i q_i/p_i)$:\n$\\frac{\\partial \\theta_i}{\\partial q_i} = \\frac{1}{1 + (\\omega_i q_i/p_i)^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\omega_i}{p_i} = \\frac{p_i^2}{p_i^2 + \\omega_i^2q_i^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\omega_i}{p_i} = \\frac{\\omega_i p_i}{p_i^2 + \\omega_i^2q_i^2}$\n$\\frac{\\partial \\theta_i}{\\partial p_i} = \\frac{1}{1 + (\\omega_i q_i/p_i)^2} \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{\\omega_i q_i}{p_i^2}\\right) = \\frac{p_i^2}{p_i^2 + \\omega_i^2q_i^2} \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{\\omega_i q_i}{p_i^2}\\right) = \\frac{-\\omega_i q_i}{p_i^2 + \\omega_i^2q_i^2}$\nNow computing the Poisson bracket:\n$$\n\\{\\theta_i, J_i\\} = \\frac{\\partial \\theta_i}{\\partial q_i}\\frac{\\partial J_i}{\\partial p_i} - \\frac{\\partial \\theta_i}{\\partial p_i}\\frac{\\partial J_i}{\\partial q_i}\n$$\n$$\n\\{\\theta_i, J_i\\} = \\left(\\frac{\\omega_i p_i}{p_i^2 + \\omega_i^2q_i^2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{p_i}{\\omega_i}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{-\\omega_i q_i}{p_i^2 + \\omega_i^2q_i^2}\\right)(\\omega_i q_i)\n$$\n$$\n\\{\\theta_i, J_i\\} = \\frac{p_i^2}{p_i^2 + \\omega_i^2q_i^2} + \\frac{\\omega_i^2 q_i^2}{p_i^2 + \\omega_i^2q_i^2} = \\frac{p_i^2 + \\omega_i^2q_i^2}{p_i^2 + \\omega_i^2q_i^2} = 1\n$$\nThus, we have confirmed that $\\{\\theta_i, J_j\\} = \\delta_{ij}$.\n\n**4. Hamiltonian Flow and Periodicity of Angle Variables**\n\nIn action-angle coordinates, the Hamiltonian is $H = H_1 + H_2 = \\omega_1 J_1 + \\omega_2 J_2$.\nThe equations of motion for the angle variables are given by Hamilton's equations:\n$$\n\\dot{\\theta}_i = \\{\\theta_i, H\\} = \\{\\theta_i, \\omega_1 J_1 + \\omega_2 J_2\\} = \\omega_1 \\{\\theta_i, J_1\\} + \\omega_2 \\{\\theta_i, J_2\\}\n$$\nUsing the canonical relation $\\{\\theta_i, J_j\\} = \\delta_{ij}$:\nFor $i=1$: $\\dot{\\theta}_1 = \\omega_1\\{\\theta_1, J_1\\} + \\omega_2\\{\\theta_1, J_2\\} = \\omega_1(1) + \\omega_2(0) = \\omega_1$.\nFor $i=2$: $\\dot{\\theta}_2 = \\omega_1\\{\\theta_2, J_1\\} + \\omega_2\\{\\theta_2, J_2\\} = \\omega_1(0) + \\omega_2(1) = \\omega_2$.\nThis shows that the angle variables evolve linearly in time: $\\theta_i(t) = \\omega_i t + \\theta_i(0)$. The frequencies of the angle variables are the frequencies of the oscillators.\n\nThe angle variables $\\theta_i$ are $2\\pi$-periodic for two fundamental reasons.\nFirst, from the perspective of the Liouville-Arnold theorem, the angle variables are coordinates on the invariant torus $\\mathbb{T}^2$. A torus is topologically a product of circles, $\\mathbb{T}^2 = S^1 \\times S^1$. Coordinates on a circle are naturally periodic. By convention, this period is taken to be $2\\pi$.\nSecond, we can see this from the original coordinates. The motion for each subsystem $(q_i, p_i)$ is governed by Hamilton's equations for $H_i$:\n$\\dot{q}_i = \\{q_i, H_i\\} = \\partial H_i/\\partial p_i = p_i$\n$\\dot{p}_i = \\{p_i, H_i\\} = -\\partial H_i/\\partial q_i = -\\omega_i^2q_i$\nThis gives the equation of motion for a simple harmonic oscillator: $\\ddot{q}_i + \\omega_i^2q_i = 0$. The solution is periodic with period $T_i = 2\\pi/\\omega_i$. Over one period, the phase point $(q_i(t), p_i(t))$ traces a complete ellipse and returns to its starting point. During this time $T_i$, the corresponding angle variable $\\theta_i(t) = \\omega_i t + \\theta_i(0)$ changes by $\\Delta\\theta_i = \\omega_i T_i = \\omega_i(2\\pi/\\omega_i) = 2\\pi$. Since the physical state of the subsystem is identical after $\\theta_i$ changes by $2\\pi$, the angle variable is a $2\\pi$-periodic coordinate.\n\nThe explicit analytical expressions for the angle variables are therefore:\n$$\n\\theta_1(q,p) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\omega_1 q_1}{p_1}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_2(q,p) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\omega_2 q_2}{p_2}\\right)\n$$",

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated to be valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and falls squarely within the domain of geometric mechanics. It presents a standard, solvable problem concerning a completely integrable Hamiltonian system.\n\nWe begin by establishing the properties of the given integrals of motion, $H = \\frac{p_x^2 + p_y^2}{2m}$ and $I = p_y$, on the phase space $T^*Q$ with $Q = \\mathbb{R} \\times S^1$. The phase space coordinates are $(x, y, p_x, p_y)$.\n\nFirst, we verify that $H$ and $I$ are in involution, i.e., their Poisson bracket $\\{H, I\\}$ is zero. The Poisson bracket of two functions $f$ and $g$ on the phase space is defined as:\n$$\n\\{f, g\\} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q_i} \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p_i} - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_i} \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial q_i} \\right)\n$$\nIn our case, the coordinates are $(q_1, q_2) = (x, y)$ and the conjugate momenta are $(p_1, p_2) = (p_x, p_y)$.\nThe partial derivatives of $H$ and $I$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_x} = \\frac{p_x}{m}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_y} = \\frac{p_y}{m}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial x} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial y} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial p_x} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial p_y} = 1\n$$\nUsing these, the Poisson bracket is:\n$$\n\\{H, I\\} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial p_x} - \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_x}\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial x}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial p_y} - \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_y}\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial y}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\{H, I\\} = \\left( (0)(0) - \\left(\\frac{p_x}{m}\\right)(0) \\right) + \\left( (0)(1) - \\left(\\frac{p_y}{m}\\right)(0) \\right) = 0\n$$\nSince $\\{H, I\\} = 0$ everywhere on $T^*Q$, the functions $H$ and $I$ are in involution.\n\nNext, we establish that $H$ and $I$ are functionally independent almost everywhere. We examine their gradients (exterior derivatives) $dH$ and $dI$:\n$$\ndH = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_x} dp_x + \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_y} dp_y = \\frac{p_x}{m} dp_x + \\frac{p_y}{m} dp_y\n$$\n$$\ndI = \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial p_y} dp_y = dp_y\n$$\nFunctional independence requires that $dH$ and $dI$ are linearly independent. We check this by computing their wedge product:\n$$\ndH \\wedge dI = \\left(\\frac{p_x}{m} dp_x + \\frac{p_y}{m} dp_y\\right) \\wedge dp_y = \\frac{p_x}{m} (dp_x \\wedge dp_y) + \\frac{p_y}{m} (dp_y \\wedge dp_y)\n$$\nSince $dp_y \\wedge dp_y = 0$, we have:\n$$\ndH \\wedge dI = \\frac{p_x}{m} dp_x \\wedge dp_y\n$$\nThis wedge product is non-zero if and only if $p_x \\neq 0$. The set where $p_x=0$ is a submanifold of codimension $1$, so $H$ and $I$ are functionally independent almost everywhere on $T^*Q$.\n\nThe dimension of the phase space is $\\dim(T^*Q) = 2 \\times \\dim(Q) = 2 \\times 2 = 4$. We have found two functionally independent integrals in involution, which equals the number of degrees of freedom ($n=2$). Therefore, the system is completely integrable in the sense of Liouville.\n\nWe now analyze the level set $F^{-1}(c)$ for a regular value $c = (E, \\ell)$. The level set is defined by the equations:\n$$\nH = E \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{p_x^2 + p_y^2}{2m} = E\n$$\n$$\nI = \\ell \\quad \\implies \\quad p_y = \\ell\n$$\nSubstituting the second equation into the first yields:\n$$\n\\frac{p_x^2 + \\ell^2}{2m} = E \\quad \\implies \\quad p_x^2 = 2mE - \\ell^2\n$$\nThe problem specifies the condition $E > \\frac{\\ell^2}{2m}$, which ensures that $2mE - \\ell^2 > 0$. This implies that $p_x$ must take one of two distinct, non-zero real values:\n$$\np_x = \\pm \\sqrt{2mE - \\ell^2}\n$$\nThe fact that $p_x \\neq 0$ on this level set confirms that $c=(E, \\ell)$ is a regular value of the map $F = (H,I)$, and the level set $F^{-1}(E, \\ell)$ is a smooth submanifold of $T^*Q$ of dimension $4-2=2$.\n\nThe level set $F^{-1}(E, \\ell)$ is the union of two disjoint (and therefore disconnected) components:\n$$\nM_+ = \\{ (x, y, p_x, p_y) \\in T^*Q \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R}, y \\in S^1, p_x = +\\sqrt{2mE - \\ell^2}, p_y = \\ell \\}\n$$\n$$\nM_- = \\{ (x, y, p_x, p_y) \\in T^*Q \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R}, y \\in S^1, p_x = -\\sqrt{2mE - \\ell^2}, p_y = \\ell \\}\n$$\nLet us analyze a single connected component, for instance $M_+$. For any point in $M_+$, the momentum coordinates $(p_x, p_y)$ are fixed. The configuration coordinates $(x,y)$ can be any point in the configuration manifold $Q = \\mathbb{R} \\times S^1$. Thus, there is a natural projection map $\\pi: M_+ \\to Q$ given by $\\pi(x, y, p_x, p_y) = (x, y)$. This map is a bijection, and in fact a diffeomorphism.\nTherefore, each connected component of the level set is diffeomorphic to the configuration space $Q = \\mathbb{R} \\times S^1$.\n\nThe manifold $\\mathbb{R} \\times S^1$ is an infinite cylinder. This directly addresses the geometry and topology of the level set components. The noncompactness arises from the $\\mathbb{R}$ factor, corresponding to the unbounded motion in the $x$ direction. This agrees with the extension of the Liouville-Arnold theorem to non-compact level sets, which states that a connected component of a regular level set of a completely integrable system is diffeomorphic to $T^j \\times \\mathbb{R}^{k-j}$ for some $j \\in \\{0, \\dots, k\\}$, where $k$ is the number of integrals. Here, $k=2$, and our result $\\mathbb{R} \\times S^1 \\cong \\mathbb{R}^1 \\times T^1$ corresponds to the case $j=1$. The invariant manifold is the cylinder itself, on which the commuting Hamiltonian flows of $H$ and $I$ act.\n\nThe final task is to compute the Euler characteristic $\\chi$ of a connected component. Let $M$ be one such component. We have established that $M$ is diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R} \\times S^1$. The Euler characteristic is a topological invariant, so we need to compute $\\chi(\\mathbb{R} \\times S^1)$.\n\nUsing the property that the Euler characteristic is a homotopy invariant, we note that the cylinder $\\mathbb{R} \\times S^1$ is homotopy equivalent to the circle $S^1$. A deformation retraction is given by $h_t: \\mathbb{R} \\times S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R} \\times S^1$, $h_t(x, y) = ((1-t)x, y)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$, which continuously maps the cylinder to the circle $\\{0\\} \\times S^1$.\nTherefore, $\\chi(\\mathbb{R} \\times S^1) = \\chi(S^1)$.\n\nThe Euler characteristic of a circle, $S^1$, is $0$. This can be computed from a cellular decomposition. For example, $S^1$ can be constructed with one $0$-cell (a vertex) and one $1$-cell (an edge connecting the vertex to itself). The Euler characteristic is the alternating sum of the number of cells of each dimension: $\\chi(S^1) = (\\text{number of } 0\\text{-cells}) - (\\text{number of } 1\\text{-cells}) = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n\nAlternatively, using the product formula for the Euler characteristic, $\\chi(A \\times B) = \\chi(A) \\times \\chi(B)$:\n$$\n\\chi(\\mathbb{R} \\times S^1) = \\chi(\\mathbb{R}) \\times \\chi(S^1)\n$$\nThe real line $\\mathbb{R}$ is contractible to a point. A contractible space has the same homotopy type as a point, so its Euler characteristic is $1$. Thus, $\\chi(\\mathbb{R}) = 1$.\nAs established, $\\chi(S^1) = 0$.\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\chi(\\mathbb{R} \\times S^1) = 1 \\times 0 = 0\n$$\nThe Euler characteristic of a connected component of the level set $F^{-1}(E,\\ell)$ is $0$.",
