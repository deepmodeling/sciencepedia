            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation and is found to be valid. It is a well-posed problem in geometric mechanics, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for a solution.\n\nThe problem asks for three main tasks: first, to derive the Lie–Poisson bracket on the dual of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$, identified with $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$; second, to use this bracket to show that the function $C(\\mathbf{M}) = \\|\\mathbf{M}\\|^{2}$ is a Casimir invariant; and third, to explain the role of this Casimir in the energy–Casimir method for stability analysis of a free rigid body.\n\nThe Lie–Poisson bracket for two smooth functions $F, G$ on the dual $\\mathfrak{g}^{*}$ of a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined, for $\\mu \\in \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$, as\n$$\n\\{F,G\\}(\\mu) = -\\langle \\mu, [\\mathrm{d}F(\\mu), \\mathrm{d}G(\\mu)] \\rangle\n$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{d}F(\\mu)$ and $\\mathrm{d}G(\\mu)$ are the differentials of $F$ and $G$ at $\\mu$, which are elements of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, and $[\\cdot,\\cdot]$ is the Lie bracket on $\\mathfrak{g}$. The pairing $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ is the natural pairing between $\\mathfrak{g}^{*}$ and $\\mathfrak{g}$. The negative sign is a common convention in mechanics, which yields the correct Hamilton's equations for physical systems like the rigid body.\n\nIn this problem, the Lie algebra is $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{so}(3)$, the space of $3 \\times 3$ real, skew-symmetric matrices. Its dual is $\\mathfrak{g}^* = \\mathfrak{so}(3)^*$. The problem states that we identify both $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$ and $\\mathfrak{so}(3)^*$ with $\\mathbb{R}^3$. A point in $\\mathfrak{so}(3)^*$ is identified with the angular momentum vector $\\mathbf{M} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. The functions $F$ and $G$ are maps from $\\mathbb{R}^3$ to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe identification between $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$ is given by the hat map, $\\mathbf{a} \\mapsto \\widehat{\\mathbf{a}}$, where for $\\mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2, a_3) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$,\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathbf{a}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -a_3  a_2 \\\\ a_3  0  -a_1 \\\\ -a_2  a_1  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe Lie bracket on $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$ is the matrix commutator, and the problem provides the crucial isomorphism property: $[\\widehat{\\mathbf{a}}, \\widehat{\\mathbf{b}}] = \\widehat{\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}}$ for any $\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nThe differentials $\\mathrm{d}F$ and $\\mathrm{d}G$ at a point $\\mathbf{M}$ are elements of $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$. We need to relate them to the standard gradients $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{M})$ and $\\nabla G(\\mathbf{M})$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The identification is made via the Euclidean inner product on $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The gradient $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{M})$ is the vector in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ such that for any variation $\\delta\\mathbf{M}$, the change in $F$ is $\\delta F = \\nabla F(\\mathbf{M}) \\cdot \\delta\\mathbf{M}$ to first order. Under the hat map isomorphism, the differential $\\mathrm{d}F(\\mathbf{M}) \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$ is identified with $\\widehat{\\nabla F(\\mathbf{M})}$. Similarly, $\\mathrm{d}G(\\mathbf{M})$ is identified with $\\widehat{\\nabla G(\\mathbf{M})}$.\n\nThe pairing $\\langle \\mu, \\xi \\rangle$ between $\\mu \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)^*$ and $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$ is also defined via the identification with $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and its dot product. If we identify $\\mu$ with the vector $\\mathbf{M} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ and $\\xi$ with $\\widehat{\\mathbf{v}} \\in \\mathfrak{so}(3)$ for some $\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, the pairing is given by $\\langle \\mathbf{M}, \\widehat{\\mathbf{v}} \\rangle = \\mathbf{M} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$.\n\nSubstituting these identifications into the general definition of the Lie-Poisson bracket:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item The point in the dual space is $\\mu \\to \\mathbf{M}$.\n    \\item The differentials are $\\mathrm{d}F(\\mu) \\to \\widehat{\\nabla F(\\mathbf{M})}$ and $\\mathrm{d}G(\\mu) \\to \\widehat{\\nabla G(\\mathbf{M})}$.\n    \\item The Lie bracket of the differentials is $[\\widehat{\\nabla F(\\mathbf{M})}, \\widehat{\\nabla G(\\mathbf{M})}] = \\widehat{\\nabla F(\\mathbf{M}) \\times \\nabla G(\\mathbf{M})}$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nSo, the Lie–Poisson bracket becomes:\n$$\n\\{F,G\\}(\\mathbf{M}) = -\\langle \\mathbf{M}, \\widehat{\\nabla F(\\mathbf{M}) \\times \\nabla G(\\mathbf{M})} \\rangle\n$$\nUsing the pairing rule $\\langle \\mathbf{M}, \\widehat{\\mathbf{v}} \\rangle = \\mathbf{M} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$ with $\\mathbf{v} = \\nabla F(\\mathbf{M}) \\times \\nabla G(\\mathbfM)$, we obtain the expression for the Lie–Poisson bracket on $\\mathfrak{so}(3)^* \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3$:\n$$\n\\{F,G\\}(\\mathbf{M}) = - \\mathbf{M} \\cdot (\\nabla F(\\mathbf{M}) \\times \\nabla G(\\mathbf{M}))\n$$\nThis is the desired expression in terms of $\\mathbf{M}$ and the gradients of the functions.\n\nNext, we evaluate $\\{C,F\\}(\\mathbf{M})$ for $C(\\mathbf{M}) = \\|\\mathbf{M}\\|^2 = M_1^2 + M_2^2 + M_3^2$ and an arbitrary smooth function $F(\\mathbf{M})$. First, we compute the gradient of $C$:\n$$\n\\nabla C(\\mathbf{M}) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial M_1}, \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial M_2}, \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial M_3}\\right) = (2M_1, 2M_2, 2M_3) = 2\\mathbf{M}\n$$\nNow, we substitute $\\nabla C$ into the bracket expression:\n$$\n\\{C,F\\}(\\mathbf{M}) = - \\mathbf{M} \\cdot (\\nabla C(\\mathbf{M}) \\times \\nabla F(\\mathbf{M})) = - \\mathbf{M} \\cdot (2\\mathbf{M} \\times \\nabla F(\\mathbf{M}))\n$$\nThis expression is a scalar triple product. A fundamental property of the vector cross product is that for any vector $\\mathbf{v}$, the vector $\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{w}$ is orthogonal to $\\mathbf{v}$. Therefore, their dot product is zero: $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{w}) = 0$. In our case, with $\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{M}$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M} \\cdot (\\mathbf{M} \\times \\nabla F(\\mathbf{M})) = 0\n$$\nThus, the Poisson bracket is:\n$$\n\\{C,F\\}(\\mathbf{M}) = -2 \\times 0 = 0\n$$\nSince $\\{C,F\\}(\\mathbf{M})=0$ for any smooth function $F$, $C(\\mathbf{M}) = \\|\\mathbf{M}\\|^2$ is a Casimir function for this Lie–Poisson structure.\n\nFinally, we explain the role of this Casimir in the energy–Casimir method for analyzing the stability of a free rigid body. The dynamics of a free rigid body, after reduction due to $SO(3)$ symmetry, are described by Euler's equations on $\\mathbb{R}^3$, which represents the body's angular momentum, $\\mathbf{M}$. These equations are Hamiltonian with respect to the Lie-Poisson bracket derived above, with the Hamiltonian being the kinetic energy $H(\\mathbf{M}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{M} \\cdot \\mathbf{I}^{-1}\\mathbf{M}$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the inertia tensor. The equations of motion are $\\dot{\\mathbf{M}} = \\{\\mathbf{M},H\\} = \\mathbf{M} \\times (\\mathbf{I}^{-1}\\mathbf{M})$.\n\nEquilibrium points $\\mathbf{M}_e$ of this system are steady rotations, where $\\dot{\\mathbf{M}} = \\mathbf{0}$. This occurs when $\\mathbf{M}_e$ is aligned with a principal axis of the inertia tensor. To assess the Lyapunov stability of such an equilibrium, one seeks a Lyapunov function $V(\\mathbf{M})$ which is conserved, has a strict local extremum (minimum or maximum) at $\\mathbf{M}_e$, and is constant on system trajectories.\n\nThe Hamiltonian $H$ is conserved, but it does not always have a local extremum at an equilibrium (e.g., for rotation about the intermediate axis, $H$ has a saddle). This is where the Casimir invariant $C(\\mathbf{M})$ becomes crucial. Since $\\{C,F\\}=0$ for any $F$, $C$ is conserved along any trajectory. This means the dynamics are confined to the level sets of $C$, which are spheres $\\|\\mathbf{M}\\|^2 = \\text{constant}$. These spheres are the coadjoint orbits of the $SO(3)$ action.\n\nThe energy-Casimir method consists of constructing a new conserved quantity by combining the energy and the Casimir. For any smooth function $\\Phi \\colon \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, the function $H_\\Phi(\\mathbf{M}) = H(\\mathbf{M}) + \\Phi(C(\\mathbf{M}))$ is also conserved, because its time evolution is given by the Poisson bracket with $H$:\n$$\n\\dot{H}_\\Phi = \\{H_\\Phi, H\\} = \\{H,H\\} + \\{\\Phi(C), H\\} = 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\nThe second term is zero because $C$ is a Casimir. The goal is to choose the function $\\Phi$ such that $H_\\Phi$ has a strict local extremum at the equilibrium point $\\mathbf{M}_e$. This requires two conditions:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item The first variation of $H_\\Phi$ must vanish at $\\mathbf{M}_e$: $\\nabla H_\\Phi(\\mathbf{M}_e) = \\mathbf{0}$. This implies $\\nabla H(\\mathbf{M}_e) + \\Phi'(C(\\mathbf{M}_e))\\nabla C(\\mathbf{M}_e) = \\mathbf{0}$. This condition can be satisfied for any equilibrium point $\\mathbf{M}_e$ by appropriately choosing the constant value $\\lambda = \\Phi'(C(\\mathbf{M}_e))$.\n    \\item The second variation (Hessian matrix) of $H_\\Phi$ at $\\mathbf{M}_e$, $D^2 H_\\Phi(\\mathbf{M}_e)$, must be definite (either positive or negative) when restricted to the tangent space of the coadjoint orbit (the sphere $C(\\mathbf{M}) = C(\\mathbf{M}_e)$) at $\\mathbf{M}_e$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nIf such a $\\Phi$ can be found, then $H_\\Phi$ serves as a local Lyapunov function, and the equilibrium point $\\mathbf{M}_e$ is proven to be Lyapunov stable. This method therefore leverages the existence of a Casimir invariant to construct a tailored conserved quantity that can certify stability.",

We evaluate this at an equilibrium point $M_{e} = M_{0} e_{i}$, where $e_{i}$ is the $i$-th standard basis vector. This means $M_{j} = M_{0}\\delta_{ji}$. The equilibrium condition $\\nabla F(M_{e}) = 0$ requires the $i$-th component of the gradient to be zero, as all other components are trivially zero:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{I_{i}} + \\lambda\\right)M_{0} = 0\n$$\nGiven that $M_{0} \\neq 0$, we find the value of the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda = -\\frac{1}{I_{i}}\n$$\nNext, we compute the second variation, $\\delta^{2}F$, which is the quadratic form associated with the Hessian matrix $D^{2}F$. The entries of the Hessian are $(D^{2}F)_{jk} = \\frac{\\partial^{2}F}{\\partial M_{j} \\partial M_{k}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2}F}{\\partial M_{j} \\partial M_{k}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial M_{j}}\\left[\\left(\\frac{1}{I_{k}} + \\lambda\\right) M_{k}\\right] = \\left(\\frac{1}{I_{k}} + \\lambda\\right)\\delta_{jk}\n$$\nThe Hessian is a diagonal matrix. At the equilibrium $M_{e}$, we substitute $\\lambda = -1/I_{i}$, yielding:\n$$\nD^{2}F(M_{e}) = \\text{diag}\\left(\\frac{1}{I_{1}} - \\frac{1}{I_{i}}, \\frac{1}{I_{2}} - \\frac{1}{I_{i}}, \\frac{1}{I_{3}} - \\frac{1}{I_{i}}\\right)\n$$\nThe second variation for an arbitrary perturbation $\\delta M$ is $\\delta^{2} F(\\delta M) = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{I_{j}} - \\frac{1}{I_{i}}\\right)(\\delta M_{j})^{2}$.\nWe must restrict this quadratic form to the tangent plane of the coadjoint orbit at $M_{e}$, denoted $T_{M_{e}}\\mathcal{O}_{|M_{e}|}$. The orbit $\\mathcal{O}_{|M_{e}|}$ is a sphere defined by $|M|^{2} = |M_{e}|^{2} = M_{0}^{2}$. The tangent plane is the set of vectors $\\delta M$ orthogonal to the normal vector of the sphere at $M_e$, which is parallel to $M_e$. The condition is $\\delta M \\cdot M_{e} = 0$. For $M_{e} = M_{0}e_{i}$, this implies $M_{0}(\\delta M \\cdot e_{i}) = M_{0}\\delta M_{i} = 0$. As $M_{0} \\neq 0$, we have the constraint $\\delta M_{i} = 0$.\nApplying this constraint to $\\delta^{2}F$, the $i$-th term in the sum vanishes, giving the restricted second variation:\n$$\n\\delta^{2}F|_{T_{M_{e}}\\mathcal{O}} (\\delta M) = \\sum_{j \\neq i} \\left(\\frac{1}{I_{j}} - \\frac{1}{I_{i}}\\right) (\\delta M_{j})^{2}\n$$\n\n**2) Specialization to Minimum- and Maximum-Inertia Axes**\n\nWe now apply this general formula to the specified cases.\n\nCase $i=1$ (minimum-inertia axis): The equilibrium is $M_e = M_{0}e_{1}$. The perturbations must satisfy $\\delta M_{1} = 0$. An orthonormal basis for the tangent plane is $\\{e_{2}, e_{3}\\}$. The restricted second variation is:\n$$\n\\delta^{2}F|_{i=1} = \\left(\\frac{1}{I_{2}} - \\frac{1}{I_{1}}\\right)(\\delta M_{2})^{2} + \\left(\\frac{1}{I_{3}} - \\frac{1}{I_{1}}\\right)(\\delta M_{3})^{2}\n$$\nThis expression is in diagonal form with respect to the basis $\\{e_2, e_3\\}$. The diagonal coefficients are the terms in parentheses.\n\nCase $i=3$ (maximum-inertia axis): The equilibrium is $M_e = M_{0}e_{3}$. The perturbations must satisfy $\\delta M_{3} = 0$. An orthonormal basis for the tangent plane is $\\{e_{1}, e_{2}\\}$. The restricted second variation is:\n$$\n\\delta^{2}F|_{i=3} = \\left(\\frac{1}{I_{1}} - \\frac{1}{I_{3}}\\right)(\\delta M_{1})^{2} + \\left(\\frac{1}{I_{2}} - \\frac{1}{I_{3}}\\right)(\\delta M_{2})^{2}\n$$\nThis is in diagonal form with respect to the basis $\\{e_1, e_2\\}$, with diagonal coefficients given by the terms in parentheses.\n\n**3) Stability Conclusion**\n\nThe stability of each equilibrium is determined by the definiteness of the respective quadratic form, which depends on the signs of the coefficients. We use the given relation $0  I_{1}  I_{2}  I_{3}$, which implies for the inverse moments: $\\frac{1}{I_{1}}  \\frac{1}{I_{2}}  \\frac{1}{I_{3}}  0$.\n\nFor the $i=1$ case:\n- The coefficient $(\\frac{1}{I_{2}} - \\frac{1}{I_{1}})$ is negative because $I_1  I_2 \\implies \\frac{1}{I_1}  \\frac{1}{I_2}$.\n- The coefficient $(\\frac{1}{I_{3}} - \\frac{1}{I_{1}})$ is negative because $I_1  I_3 \\implies \\frac{1}{I_1}  \\frac{1}{I_3}$.\nSince both coefficients are negative, $\\delta^{2}F$ is negative definite. This implies that $M_{e}=M_0e_1$ is a strict local maximum of $F$ when restricted to the coadjoint orbit. By the energy-Casimir method, this implies the equilibrium is stable.\n\nFor the $i=3$ case:\n- The coefficient $(\\frac{1}{I_{1}} - \\frac{1}{I_{3}})$ is positive because $I_1  I_3 \\implies \\frac{1}{I_1}  \\frac{1}{I_3}$.\n- The coefficient $(\\frac{1}{I_{2}} - \\frac{1}{I_{3}})$ is positive because $I_2  I_3 \\implies \\frac{1}{I_2}  \\frac{1}{I_3}$.\nSince both coefficients are positive, $\\delta^{2}F$ is positive definite. This implies that $M_{e}=M_0e_3$ is a strict local minimum of $F$ on the coadjoint orbit, which also implies the equilibrium is stable.\n\nThe final answer requires the four diagonal coefficients, written in a clear fractional form:\n- Case $i=1$, coefficient along $e_{2}$: $\\frac{1}{I_{2}} - \\frac{1}{I_{1}} = \\frac{I_{1} - I_{2}}{I_{1}I_{2}}$.\n- Case $i=1$, coefficient along $e_{3}$: $\\frac{1}{I_{3}} - \\frac{1}{I_{1}} = \\frac{I_{1} - I_{3}}{I_{1}I_{3}}$.\n- Case $i=3$, coefficient along $e_{1}$: $\\frac{1}{I_{1}} - \\frac{1}{I_{3}} = \\frac{I_{3} - I_{1}}{I_{1}I_{3}}$.\n- Case $i=3$, coefficient along $e_{2}$: $\\frac{1}{I_{2}} - \\frac{1}{I_{3}} = \\frac{I_{3} - I_{2}}{I_{2}I_{3}}$.\nThese are arranged in a row matrix as requested.",
