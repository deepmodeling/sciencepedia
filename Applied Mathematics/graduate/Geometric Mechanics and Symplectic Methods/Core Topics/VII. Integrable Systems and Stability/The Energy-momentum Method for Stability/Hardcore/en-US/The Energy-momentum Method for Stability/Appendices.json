The Hamiltonian vector field $X_{H}$ associated with a smooth function $H:M\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is defined by the condition\n$$\n\\iota_{X_{H}}\\omega=dH,\n$$\nwhere $\\iota$ denotes interior contraction. For a Hamiltonian $G$-action with momentum map $J:M\\to\\mathfrak{g}^{*}$, the defining property of the momentum map is that for each $\\xi\\in\\mathfrak{g}$, the differential of the pairing $\\langle J,\\xi\\rangle$ satisfies\n$$\nd\\langle J,\\xi\\rangle=\\iota_{\\xi_{M}}\\omega,\n$$\nwhere $\\xi_{M}$ is the fundamental vector field generated by $\\xi\\in\\mathfrak{g}$ via the $G$-action on $M$.\n\nDefine the augmented Hamiltonian $H_{\\xi}:=H-\\langle J,\\xi\\rangle$. Its differential is\n$$\ndH_{\\xi}=dH-d\\langle J,\\xi\\rangle.\n$$\nSubstituting the defining relations, we obtain\n$$\ndH_{\\xi}=\\iota_{X_{H}}\\omega-\\iota_{\\xi_{M}}\\omega=\\iota_{X_{H}-\\xi_{M}}\\omega.\n$$\nTherefore, a point $m\\in M$ is a critical point of $H_{\\xi}$ if and only if\n$$\ndH_{\\xi}(m)=0\\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad \\iota_{X_{H}(m)-\\xi_{M}(m)}\\omega=0.\n$$\nSince $\\omega$ is nondegenerate, the condition $\\iota_{Y}\\omega=0$ implies $Y=0$. Hence,\n$$\nX_{H}(m)-\\xi_{M}(m)=0\\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad X_{H}(m)=\\xi_{M}(m).\n$$\nThis equality states that the Hamiltonian vector field at $m$ coincides with the infinitesimal generator of the group action with velocity $\\xi$. Consequently, the trajectory of the Hamiltonian flow through $m$ is tangent to the $G$-orbit generated by $\\xi$, which means $m$ is a relative equilibrium: its evolution under the Hamiltonian flow is equivalent to the action of a one-parameter subgroup of $G$.\n\nWe now specialize to $M=T^{*}S^{1}$ with coordinates $(q,p)$ and canonical symplectic form $\\omega=dq\\wedge dp$. The Hamiltonian is\n$$\nH(q,p)=\\frac{1}{2}p^{2}+V(q),\n$$\nand the $S^{1}$ action on the base coordinate $q$ is by rotations, so the corresponding fundamental vector field for $\\xi\\in\\mathbb{R}\\cong\\mathfrak{g}$ is\n$$\n\\xi_{M}=\\xi\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}.\n$$\nThe momentum map for the cotangent-lifted action is $J(q,p)=p$.

The first condition then yields the required expression for $\\xi$:\n$$\n\\xi=p_{0}.\n$$\nThis is consistent with the characterization of relative equilibria derived above: at the point $(p_{0},q_{0})$, the Hamiltonian vector field $X_{H}(q,p)=\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}-\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}=p\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}-V'(q)\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$ satisfies $X_{H}(m)=p_{0}\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}$, while the group velocity field is $\\xi_{M}(m)=\\xi\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}$. Equating them yields $\\xi=p_{0}$, and the vanishing of $V'(q_{0})$ ensures $X_{H}(m)$ is tangent to the $S^{1}$-orbit with no component in the fiber direction. Thus, $m$ is a relative equilibrium with group velocity $\\xi=p_{0}$, and the condition $dH_{\\xi}(m)=0$ precisely encodes this property through the augmented Hamiltonian framework central to the energy-momentum method for stability.",

One solution is the trivial equilibrium $x=y=p_{x}=p_{y}=0$, which exists for any $\\xi$. Non-trivial relative equilibria exist if $(x,y) \\neq (0,0)$, which requires\n$$\na+b(x^{2}+y^{2}) - \\xi^{2} = 0.\n$$\nLet $r^{2} = x^{2}+y^{2}$.

Since a cubic polynomial has a finite number of roots (at most $3$), the set of possible values for $\\xi$ is discrete. Each such $\\xi$ defines a unique $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ orbit of relative equilibria. Thus, the relative equilibria are isolated modulo the $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ symmetry. A non-degeneracy condition, ensuring these orbits do not bifurcate under small parameter changes, is that the roots of the cubic polynomial for $\\xi$ are simple. A root is simple if the derivative of the polynomial is non-zero at the root. The derivative is $3\\xi^{2}-a$. A multiple root exists if both the polynomial and its derivative are zero, which occurs if $4a^{3}=27b^{2}\\mu^{2}$.

This is the unique positive angular velocity $\\xi^{\\ast}$.\n\nTo find $\\xi^{\\ast}$, we solve the depressed cubic equation $\\xi^{3} - a\\xi - b\\mu = 0$ using Cardano's formula. Let $\\xi=u+v$. Substitution yields $u^{3}+v^{3}+(3uv-a)(u+v)-b\\mu=0$. We impose the conditions:\n$$\nu^{3}+v^{3} = b\\mu \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 3uv=a \\implies uv = a/3.\n$$\nFrom these, we have $u^{3}v^{3} = a^{3}/27$. So $u^{3}$ and $v^{3}$ are the roots of the quadratic equation\n$$\nY^{2} - (u^{3}+v^{3})Y + u^{3}v^{3} = 0 \\implies Y^{2} - (b\\mu)Y + \\frac{a^{3}}{27} = 0.\n$$\nThe roots are\n$$\nY = \\frac{b\\mu \\pm \\sqrt{(b\\mu)^{2} - 4(a^{3}/27)}}{2} = \\frac{b\\mu}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{b^{2}\\mu^{2}}{4} - \\frac{a^{3}}{27}}.\n$$\nThe condition $27b^{2}\\mu^{2}4a^{3}$ ensures that the term under the square root is positive, so $u^{3}$ and $v^{3}$ are real and distinct. The unique real solution for $\\xi$ is the sum of the real cube roots of these values:\n$$\n\\xi^{\\ast} = \\left(\\frac{b\\mu}{2} + \\sqrt{\\frac{b^{2}\\mu^{2}}{4} - \\frac{a^{3}}{27}}\\right)^{1/3} + \\left(\\frac{b\\mu}{2} - \\sqrt{\\frac{b^{2}\\mu^{2}}{4} - \\frac{a^{3}}{27}}\\right)^{1/3}.\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the unique positive angular velocity.",
