            "solution": "The problem asks for the dimension of the Chetaev admissible distribution $D_{q}$ and the conditions under which the total distribution $D = \\bigcup_{q \\in Q} D_q$ forms a smooth vector subbundle of the tangent bundle $TQ$.\n\nLet us begin by analyzing the definition of the Chetaev admissible distribution $D_q$ at a point $q$ in the configuration manifold $Q = \\mathbb{R}^n$. The tangent space at any point $q \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, denoted $T_qQ$, is an $n$-dimensional real vector space. A vector $v \\in T_qQ$ has components $v^\\alpha$ in the natural coordinate basis, so $v = v^\\alpha \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^\\alpha}$. The dimension of this tangent space is $\\dim(T_qQ) = n$.\n\nThe distribution $D_q$ is defined as the set of all vectors $v \\in T_qQ$ that satisfy the $m$ linear homogeneous equations given by the Pfaffian constraints:\n$$\nD_{q}=\\left\\{v\\in T_{q}Q\\;\\middle|\\;\\omega^{a}_{\\alpha}(q)\\,v^{\\alpha}=0\\text{ for all }a=1,\\dots,m\\right\\}.\n$$\nIn this expression, the summation over the repeated index $\\alpha$ from $1$ to $n$ is implied by the Einstein summation convention.\n\nThis set of $m$ linear equations can be interpreted in the language of linear algebra. For a fixed point $q \\in Q$, the coefficients $\\omega^a_\\alpha(q)$ form an $m \\times n$ matrix. Let us define a linear map $L_q: T_qQ \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$ as follows: for any vector $v = v^\\alpha \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^\\alpha} \\in T_qQ$, its image under $L_q$ is the $m$-tuple of real numbers given by\n$$\nL_q(v) = (\\omega^1_\\alpha(q) v^\\alpha, \\omega^2_\\alpha(q) v^\\alpha, \\dots, \\omega^m_\\alpha(q) v^\\alpha).\n$$\nThe condition $\\omega^{a}_{\\alpha}(q)\\,v^{\\alpha}=0$ for all $a=1,\\dots,m$ is equivalent to the condition $L_q(v) = 0$, where $0$ is the zero vector in $\\mathbb{R}^m$.\nTherefore, the set $D_q$ is precisely the kernel (or null space) of the linear map $L_q$:\n$$\nD_q = \\ker(L_q).\n$$\nSince $D_q$ is the kernel of a linear map, it is a vector subspace of $T_qQ$. To find its dimension, we can apply the rank-nullity theorem from linear algebra. The theorem states that for a linear map $L: V \\to W$, the following relation holds:\n$$\n\\dim(\\ker(L)) + \\dim(\\operatorname{im}(L)) = \\dim(V).\n$$\nIn our context, the domain is $V = T_qQ$ with $\\dim(V) = n$. The space $D_q$ is the kernel, so $\\dim(\\ker(L_q)) = \\dim(D_q)$. The dimension of the image of $L_q$, $\\dim(\\operatorname{im}(L_q))$, is the rank of the map $L_q$, which we denote as $\\operatorname{rank}(L_q)$. The rank-nullity theorem thus gives:\n$$\n\\dim(D_q) + \\operatorname{rank}(L_q) = n.\n$$\nTo determine $\\dim(D_q)$, we must compute $\\operatorname{rank}(L_q)$. The rank of the linear map $L_q$ is the dimension of the image space, which is spanned by the vectors obtained by applying $L_q$ to the basis vectors of $T_qQ$. This rank is also equal to the rank of the $m \\times n$ matrix whose entries are $\\omega^a_\\alpha(q)$. Furthermore, the rank of a matrix is equal to the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns. The rows of this matrix are given by the components of the constraint one-forms $\\omega^a(q)$ at the point $q$.\n\nThe problem states that the $m$ constraint one-forms $\\omega^a(q)$ are pointwise linearly independent at $q$. The one-forms $\\{\\omega^1(q), \\dots, \\omega^m(q)\\}$ are elements of the cotangent space $T_q^*Q$. Their linear independence at $q$ means that the corresponding row vectors of the matrix $(\\omega^a_\\alpha(q))$ are linearly independent. Since there are $m$ such row vectors, their linear independence implies that the rank of the matrix is exactly $m$.\nThus, we have $\\operatorname{rank}(L_q) = m$.\n\nWe can now substitute this result into the rank-nullity equation:\n$$\n\\dim(D_q) + m = n.\n$$\nSolving for the dimension of the admissible distribution $D_q$, we find:\n$$\n\\dim(D_q) = n - m.\n$$\nThis result is valid provided that $m \\le n$, which is a necessary condition for the $m$ one-forms to be linearly independent in an $n$-dimensional space of one-forms.\n\nNext, we address the condition for the distribution $D = \\bigcup_{q \\in Q} D_q$ to define a smooth vector subbundle of the tangent bundle $TQ$. A distribution $D$ is a smooth vector subbundle of $TQ$ if, for every point $p \\in Q$, there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $p$ and a set of smooth vector fields $\\{X_1, \\dots, X_k\\}$ on $U$ such that for every $q \\in U$, the set of vectors $\\{X_1(q), \\dots, X_k(q)\\}$ forms a basis for $D_q$. A necessary condition for this is that the dimension of the subspace $D_q$ must be constant for all $q \\in Q$ (or at least locally constant on open sets covering $Q$).\n\nThe dimension of $D_q$ is given by $\\dim(D_q) = n - \\operatorname{rank}(\\{\\omega^a(q)\\}_{a=1}^m)$. For this dimension to be constant, the rank of the set of constraint one-forms, $\\operatorname{rank}(\\{\\omega^a(q)\\}_{a=1}^m)$, must be constant as a function of $q$.\nLet $k(q) = \\operatorname{rank}(\\{\\omega^a(q)\\}_{a=1}^m)$. The condition is that $k(q)$ must be a constant, say $k$, for all $q \\in Q$. If this condition holds, then by the constant rank theorem, the kernel of the bundle map from $TQ$ to $Q \\times \\mathbb{R}^m$ defined by the one-forms $\\omega^a$ is a smooth vector subbundle of $TQ$ of rank (i.e., fiber dimension) $n-k$.\n\nThe problem is phrased in the context where linear independence holds, which implies maximal rank. Therefore, the specific rank assumption needed so that $D$ is a regular distribution of dimension $n-m$ is that the $m$ smooth one-forms $\\{\\omega^1, \\dots, \\omega^m\\}$ are linearly independent at *every* point $q \\in Q$. This ensures that the rank of the system of constraints is constant and equal to $m$ everywhere, and consequently, $\\dim(D_q) = n-m$ is constant for all $q \\in Q$.\n\nThe final answer required is the symbolic expression for the dimension of $D_q$ under the given condition of linear independence. As derived, this is $n-m$.",

A general vector $v \\in T_qQ$ can be written as $v = \\dot{q}^{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{i}}$ (using Einstein summation), where $\\dot{q}^{i}$ are the components of the velocity vector. A general covector $\\omega \\in T_q^*Q$ can be written as $\\omega = \\omega_i dq^{i}$.\n\nThe system is subject to two linear velocity constraints, given by the one-forms:\n$$ \\omega^{1} = dq^{1} + \\alpha \\, dq^{2} $$\n$$ \\omega^{2} = dq^{3} $$\nwhere $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a constant.

For a general set of linear constraints $f_k(\\dot{q}) = A_{ki}(q)\\dot{q}^i = 0$, the corresponding constraint one-forms are $\\omega^k = A_{ki}(q) dq^i$.

According to the Chetaev principle, the admissible virtual displacements are the vectors that are annihilated by the reaction covectors. Therefore, $D_q$ is the annihilator of $S_q$, denoted $D_q = (S_q)^{\\circ}$. A vector $X \\in T_qQ$ belongs to $D_q$ if and only if $\\omega(X) = 0$ for all $\\omega \\in S_q$.

Derivation of the Equations of Motion and the Lagrange Multiplier**\n\nThe system is described by the Lagrangian $L=\\frac{1}{2}m(\\dot{x}^{2}+\\dot{y}^{2}+\\dot{z}^{2})$ on the configuration space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with coordinates $q=(x,y,z)$.

The Chetaev condition for admissible virtual displacements $\\delta q$ is that they must satisfy the constraint, i.e., $\\omega(\\delta q) = \\delta z - x\\,\\delta y = 0$. The principle of zero virtual work dictates that the constraint force does no work on any admissible virtual displacement, which implies that the constraint force one-form $F_c$ must be proportional to the constraint one-form $\\omega$. Thus, $F_c = \\lambda \\omega$ for some scalar function $\\lambda(t)$, the Lagrange multiplier.\n\nThe components of the constraint force are found by expanding $F_c = \\lambda \\omega = \\lambda(dz - x\\,dy)$:\n$F_{c,x} = 0$\n$F_{c,y} = -x\\lambda$\n$F_{c,z} = \\lambda$\n\nThe derivatives of the Lagrangian are:\n$\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x}} = m\\dot{x}$, $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{y}} = m\\dot{y}$, $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{z}} = m\\dot{z}$.\n$\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} = 0$, $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} = 0$, $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial z} = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these into the Euler-Lagrange equations yields the constrained equations of motion:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nm\\ddot{x} &= 0 \\quad &(1) \\\\\nm\\ddot{y} &= -x\\lambda \\quad &(2) \\\\\nm\\ddot{z} &= \\lambda \\quad &(3)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nTo determine the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$, we enforce the constraint by requiring that its time derivative along a valid trajectory is zero. Differentiating the constraint equation $\\dot{z} - x\\dot{y} = 0$ with respect to time gives:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}(\\dot{z} - x\\dot{y}) = \\ddot{z} - \\dot{x}\\dot{y} - x\\ddot{y} = 0 $$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $\\ddot{y}$ and $\\ddot{z}$ from the equations of motion, $\\ddot{y} = -\\frac{x\\lambda}{m}$ and $\\ddot{z} = \\frac{\\lambda}{m}$, into the differentiated constraint equation:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{m}\\right) - \\dot{x}\\dot{y} - x\\left(-\\frac{x\\lambda}{m}\\right) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\lambda}{m} - \\dot{x}\\dot{y} + \\frac{x^2\\lambda}{m} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\lambda}{m}(1+x^2) = \\dot{x}\\dot{y} $$\nSolving for $\\lambda$ gives its expression in terms of the state variables:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{m\\dot{x}\\dot{y}}{1+x^2} $$\n\n**2.

Geometric Explanation for Non-conservation of $p_y$**\n\nThe Lagrangian $L$ is independent of the coordinate $y$, which means the system possesses a symmetry under translations in the $y$-direction. The infinitesimal generator of this symmetry is the vector field $\\xi_Q = \\partial_y$ on the configuration space. In the absence of non-holonomic constraints, Noether's theorem would guarantee the conservation of the associated momentum, $p_y$.\n\nIn a non-holonomic system, a momentum associated with a symmetry $\\xi_Q$ is conserved if and only if the symmetry is a \"dynamic symmetry\" of the constrained system. This requires the constraint forces to do no work on displacements along the symmetry generator, i.e., $\\langle F_c, \\xi_Q \\rangle = 0$. Since $F_c = \\lambda \\omega$, this condition is equivalent to $\\lambda \\omega(\\xi_Q) = 0$.\n\nLet's evaluate $\\omega(\\xi_Q)$ for our system:\n$$ \\omega(\\xi_Q) = (dz - x\\,dy)(\\partial_y) = dz(\\partial_y) - x\\,dy(\\partial_y) $$\nBy definition, $dz(\\partial_y) = 0$ and $dy(\\partial_y) = 1$. Therefore,\n$$ \\omega(\\xi_Q) = -x $$\nThe rate of change of the momentum $p_y$ is given by:\n$$ \\frac{dp_y}{dt} = \\langle F_c, \\xi_Q \\rangle = \\lambda \\omega(\\xi_Q) = -x\\lambda $$\nThis matches the result obtained from the equations of motion.\n\nGeometrically, the non-conservation of $p_y$ stems from the misalignment of the symmetry generator $\\xi_Q$ with the constraint distribution $\\mathcal{D} = \\ker \\omega$. The distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ is the subspace of the tangent space containing all admissible velocities. A symmetry's associated momentum is conserved if its generator vector field lies within this distribution at every point, i.e., $\\xi_Q \\in \\mathcal{D}$. This is equivalent to the condition $\\omega(\\xi_Q) = 0$.\n\nSince we found $\\omega(\\xi_Q) = -x$, which is not identically zero, the symmetry generator $\\xi_Q = \\partial_y$ is not a section of the constraint distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ (except on the plane $x=0$). This means that a pure translation in $y$ is not an admissible virtual displacement. Consequently, the constraint force $F_c = \\lambda \\omega$, which is orthogonal to all vectors in $\\mathcal{D}$, is not necessarily orthogonal to $\\xi_Q$. The non-zero projection of the constraint force onto the symmetry direction, $\\langle F_c, \\xi_Q \\rangle = -x\\lambda$, performs work and causes the momentum $p_y$ to change over time. The failure of the symmetry to be \"horizontal\" with respect to the constraint distribution is the fundamental geometric reason for the breakdown of the conservation law.",
