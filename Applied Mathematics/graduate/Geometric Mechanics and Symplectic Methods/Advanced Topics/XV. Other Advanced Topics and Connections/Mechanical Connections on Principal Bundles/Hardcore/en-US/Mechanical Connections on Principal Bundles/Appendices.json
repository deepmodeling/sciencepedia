I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Detailed Solution\nThe problem asks for the curvature two-form $\\mathcal{B}$ of the mechanical connection $A$ on the principal bundle $P = (0, \\infty) \\times \\mathrm{SO}(2)$ endowed with the right-invariant Riemannian metric $g = m\\,dr^2 + I(r)\\,d\\theta^2$.\n\nA mechanical connection is defined by decomposing the tangent space $T_p P$ at each point $p \\in P$ into a vertical subspace $V_p P$ and a horizontal subspace $H_p P$, where $H_p P$ is the orthogonal complement of $V_p P$ with respect to the metric $g$.\n\nThe vertical subspace $V_p P$ is the kernel of the tangent map of the projection, $V_p P = \\ker(T_p\\pi)$. In the given coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, the projection is $\\pi(r, \\theta) = r$. A tangent vector is $v = v^r \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} + v^\\theta \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}$. Its pushforward is $T\\pi(v) = v^r \\frac{d}{dr}$. For $v$ to be in the kernel, we must have $v^r=0$. Thus, the vertical space $V_{(r, \\theta)}P$ is spanned by the fundamental vector field $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}$, which is associated with the generator of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(2) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe horizontal subspace $H_{(r, \\theta)}P$ consists of all vectors $v \\in T_{(r, \\theta)}P$ that are orthogonal to every vector in $V_{(r, \\theta)}P$. It is sufficient to require orthogonality to the basis vector $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}$.\nLet $v = v^r \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} + v^\\theta \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}$. The orthogonality condition is $g(v, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}) = 0$.\nUsing the given metric $g = m\\,dr^2 + I(r)\\,d\\theta^2$, the components of the metric tensor in the basis $(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta})$ are $g_{rr} = m$, $g_{\\theta\\theta} = I(r)$, and $g_{r\\theta} = 0$.\nThe inner product is:\n$$\ng\\left(v^r \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} + v^\\theta \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}\\right) = v^r g\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}\\right) + v^\\theta g\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}\\right) = v^r \\cdot 0 + v^\\theta \\cdot I(r) = v^\\theta I(r)\n$$\nFor $v$ to be horizontal, we need $v^\\theta I(r) = 0$. Since $I(r)$ is strictly positive, this implies $v^\\theta = 0$. Therefore, the horizontal subspace $H_{(r, \\theta)}P$ is spanned by the vector field $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}$.\n\nThe mechanical connection one-form $A \\in \\Omega^1(P; \\mathfrak{so}(2))$ is defined by two properties:\n1.  Its kernel is the horizontal distribution: $A(v) = 0$ for all $v \\in H P$.\n2.  It reproduces the Lie algebra element on fundamental vector fields: for any $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{so}(2)$, $A(\\xi_P) = \\xi$, where $\\xi_P$ is the fundamental vector field generated by $\\xi$.\n\nWe identify $\\mathfrak{so}(2)$ with $\\mathbb{R}$. Let's choose the basis element $\\xi = 1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The corresponding fundamental vector field is given as $\\xi_P = 1 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}$.\nLet's express the connection one-form $A$ in the cotangent basis as $A = A_r \\, dr + A_\\theta \\, d\\theta$, where the coefficients $A_r$ and $A_\\theta$ are functions on $P$ with values in $\\mathfrak{so}(2) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nApplying the two defining properties:\n1.  For any horizontal vector, such as $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}$, we have $A(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}) = 0$. Evaluating this gives:\n    $$\n    A\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\right) = (A_r \\, dr + A_\\theta \\, d\\theta)\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\right) = A_r = 0\n    $$\n2.  For the fundamental vector field $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}$ corresponding to $\\xi = 1$, we have $A(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}) = 1$. Evaluating this gives:\n    $$\n    A\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}\\right) = (A_r \\, dr + A_\\theta \\, d\\theta)\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}\\right) = A_\\theta = 1\n    $$\nCombining these results, the connection one-form is $A = 0 \\cdot dr + 1 \\cdot d\\theta = d\\theta$. Since we are working with $\\mathfrak{so}(2)$-valued forms, this is more formally $A = d\\theta \\otimes \\xi_{basis}$, where $\\xi_{basis}$ is the basis vector of $\\mathfrak{so}(2)$ that we identified with $1$. For simplicity, we write $A = d\\theta$.\n\nNext, we compute the curvature two-form $\\mathcal{B} \\in \\Omega^2(P; \\mathfrak{so}(2))$. The curvature is defined by the Cartan structure equation:\n$$\n\\mathcal{B} = dA + \\frac{1}{2}[A, A]\n$$\nwhere $dA$ is the exterior derivative of $A$, and $[A, A]$ is the wedge product of $A$ with itself, using the Lie bracket of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(2)$.\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(2)$ is one-dimensional, and thus it is Abelian. This means the Lie bracket of any two elements is zero. Consequently, the term $[A, A]$ is identically zero:\n$$\n[A, A] = [d\\theta \\otimes \\xi_{basis}, d\\theta \\otimes \\xi_{basis}] = (d\\theta \\wedge d\\theta) \\otimes [\\xi_{basis}, \\xi_{basis}] = 0 \\otimes 0 = 0\n$$\nSo, the curvature simplifies to $\\mathcal{B} = dA$.\nWe now compute the exterior derivative of the connection one-form $A = d\\theta$.\nThe one-form $d\\theta$ is defined by the coordinate function $\\theta$. In differential geometry, for any coordinate function $x^i$, the one-form $dx^i$ is closed, meaning its exterior derivative is zero, if we consider it in the context of the full set of coordinates. A more formal way to see this is to apply the property that the exterior derivative operator $d$ squares to zero, $d^2 = 0$.\n$$\n\\mathcal{B} = d(A) = d(d\\theta) = 0\n$$\nAlternatively, using the formula for the exterior derivative in local coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, for a one-form $A = A_r \\, dr + A_\\theta \\, d\\theta$:\n$$\ndA = \\left(\\frac{\\partial A_\\theta}{\\partial r} - \\frac{\\partial A_r}{\\partial \\theta}\\right) dr \\wedge d\\theta\n$$\nHere, $A_r = 0$ and $A_\\theta = 1$. Both are constants, so their partial derivatives are zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial A_\\theta}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\partial (1)}{\\partial r} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial A_r}{\\partial \\theta} = \\frac{\\partial (0)}{\\partial \\theta} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting these into the formula for $dA$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{B} = dA = (0 - 0) \\, dr \\wedge d\\theta = 0\n$$\nThe curvature two-form of the mechanical connection is zero.

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and internally consistent, resting on standard definitions within differential geometry and geometric mechanics. We can proceed with a solution. The solution is structured in two main parts as suggested by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we determine the curvature two-form $\\Omega \\in \\Omega^{2}(S^{2})$. The problem states that the total space $S^{3}$ is equipped with the standard round Riemannian metric inherited from its embedding in $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$. This metric is invariant under the action of the special orthogonal group $SO(4)$. The Hopf fibration $p: S^{3} \\to S^{2}$ is equivariant with respect to a homomorphism from a subgroup of $SO(4)$ to the group of isometries of the base space $S^{2}$, which is $SO(3)$. The mechanical connection is defined via the metric and the vertical subbundle, both of which are preserved under this action. Consequently, the connection one-form $\\mathcal{A}$ and its exterior derivative $\\mathrm{d}\\mathcal{A}$ must be invariant under this action. The curvature two-form $\\Omega$ on $S^{2}$, being related to $\\mathrm{d}\\mathcal{A}$ by $p^{*}\\Omega = \\mathrm{d}\\mathcal{A}$, must therefore be invariant under the action of $SO(3)$ on $S^{2}$. The space of $SO(3)$-invariant two-forms on the unit sphere $S^{2}$ is a one-dimensional real vector space. The standard area form $\\omega$ on the unit sphere $S^{2}$ is a basis for this space. Therefore, $\\Omega$ must be a constant multiple of $\\omega$, i.e., $\\Omega = c\\,\\omega$ for some constant $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nTo determine the constant $c$, we use the provided information about the first Chern number of the Hopf bundle, which is given as $1$. The first Chern class, represented in de Rham cohomology, is $[\\frac{\\Omega}{2\\pi}]$. The integral of this class over the fundamental cycle $S^2$ gives the Chern number:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{S^{2}}\\Omega = 1\n$$\nSubstituting $\\Omega = c\\,\\omega$ into this equation, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{S^{2}} c\\,\\omega = 1\n$$\nSince $c$ is a constant, we can pull it out of the integral:\n$$\n\\frac{c}{2\\pi}\\int_{S^{2}}\\omega = 1\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_{S^{2}}\\omega$ represents the total surface area of the base manifold, which is the unit sphere $S^{2}$. The area of a sphere of radius $r$ is $4\\pi r^{2}$. For the unit sphere, $r=1$, so the area is $4\\pi$. Substituting this value:\n$$\n\\frac{c}{2\\pi}(4\\pi) = 1\n$$\n$$\n2c = 1 \\implies c = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThus, the curvature two-form is precisely $\\Omega = \\frac{1}{2}\\omega$.\n\nNext, we compute the holonomy angle $\\theta(\\gamma)$ for the loop $\\gamma$, which is the equator of $S^{2}$. The holonomy element $h(\\gamma) \\in S^{1}$ is defined in the problem as $h(\\gamma) = \\exp(i\\,\\theta(\\gamma))$. For an Abelian structure group like $S^{1}$, the holonomy is directly related to the integral of the connection form. Specifically, the angle $\\theta(\\gamma)$ can be computed by integrating a local representation of the connection one-form on the base manifold $S^{2}$ around the loop $\\gamma$.\n\nLet $D \\subset S^{2}$ be the northern hemisphere, so that its boundary is the equator, $\\partial D = \\gamma$. Since $D$ is contractible, we can define a local section of the bundle, $\\sigma: D \\to S^{3}$, such that $p \\circ \\sigma = \\mathrm{id}_{D}$. The pullback of the connection one-form $\\mathcal{A}$ by this section gives a one-form $\\mathcal{A}_{D} = \\sigma^{*}\\mathcal{A}$ on $D$. The holonomy angle is the integral of this form along the boundary curve $\\gamma$:\n$$\n\\theta(\\gamma) = \\oint_{\\gamma} \\mathcal{A}_{D} = \\oint_{\\partial D} \\sigma^{*}\\mathcal{A}\n$$\nBy Stokes' theorem, the line integral of a one-form around a boundary is equal to the surface integral of its exterior derivative over the surface:\n$$\n\\oint_{\\partial D} \\sigma^{*}\\mathcal{A} = \\int_{D} \\mathrm{d}(\\sigma^{*}\\mathcal{A})\n$$\nThe exterior derivative operator $\\mathrm{d}$ commutes with the pullback operator $\\sigma^{*}$. Thus:\n$$\n\\int_{D} \\mathrm{d}(\\sigma^{*}\\mathcal{A}) = \\int_{D} \\sigma^{*}(\\mathrm{d}\\mathcal{A})\n$$\nWe are given that the curvature two-form $\\Omega$ on $S^{2}$ is defined by the relation $p^{*}\\Omega = \\mathrm{d}\\mathcal{A}$. Substituting this into our expression for the holonomy angle:\n$$\n\\theta(\\gamma) = \\int_{D} \\sigma^{*}(p^{*}\\Omega)\n$$\nUsing the property of pullbacks $(f \\circ g)^{*} = g^{*} \\circ f^{*}$, we get:\n$$\n\\theta(\\gamma) = \\int_{D} (p \\circ \\sigma)^{*}\\Omega\n$$\nBy the definition of a section, $p \\circ \\sigma = \\mathrm{id}_{D}$, the identity map on $D$. The pullback by the identity map is the identity operator on forms. Therefore:\n$$\n\\theta(\\gamma) = \\int_{D} (\\mathrm{id}_{D})^{*}\\Omega = \\int_{D} \\Omega\n$$\nThis establishes the direct relationship between the holonomy angle and the integral of the curvature two-form over the surface bounded by the loop.\n\nNow we can compute the value of $\\theta(\\gamma)$. We substitute the expression for $\\Omega$ that we found earlier, $\\Omega = \\frac{1}{2}\\omega$:\n$$\n\\theta(\\gamma) = \\int_{D} \\frac{1}{2}\\omega = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{D} \\omega\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_{D} \\omega$ is the surface area of the northern hemisphere $D$ of the unit sphere. The total area of the unit sphere is $4\\pi$. The area of the hemisphere is half of this value:\n$$\n\\text{Area}(D) = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{Area}(S^{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}(4\\pi) = 2\\pi\n$$\nFinally, substituting this area into the expression for the holonomy angle:\n$$\n\\theta(\\gamma) = \\frac{1}{2} (2\\pi) = \\pi\n$$\nThe holonomy angle for the equator is $\\pi$ radians.",
