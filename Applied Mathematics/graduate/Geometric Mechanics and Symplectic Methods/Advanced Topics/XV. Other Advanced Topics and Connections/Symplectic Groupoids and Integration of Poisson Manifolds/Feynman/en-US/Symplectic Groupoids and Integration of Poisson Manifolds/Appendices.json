            "solution": "The user has provided a problem in Poisson geometry and Lie theory. The task is to identify the source-simply-connected symplectic Lie groupoid integrating the dual of an abelian Lie algebra, endowed with the linear Poisson structure, and to determine its multiplicative symplectic form.\n\nThe validation of the problem statement is performed first.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Let $\\mathfrak{g}$ be an $n$-dimensional abelian Lie algebra.\n- Let $G$ be its connected and simply connected Lie group.\n- The base manifold is the dual space $\\mathfrak{g}^{*}$.\n- The Poisson structure on $\\mathfrak{g}^{*}$ is the linear Poisson structure $\\pi_{\\mathrm{lin}}$, defined by the Poisson bracket $\\{\\ell_{X},\\ell_{Y}\\}=\\ell_{[X,Y]}$ for all $X,Y \\in \\mathfrak{g}$, where $\\ell_{Z} \\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathfrak{g}^{*})$ is the linear function $\\ell_Z(\\alpha) = \\alpha(Z)$.\n- The goal is to find the source-simply-connected symplectic Lie groupoid integrating $(\\mathfrak{g}^{*},\\pi_{\\mathrm{lin}})$.\n- The path of derivation must start from first principles: determine $\\pi_{\\mathrm{lin}}$, find the associated Lie algebroid, integrate it to a Lie groupoid, and show the canonical symplectic form is multiplicative.\n- Linear coordinates on $\\mathfrak{g}^{*}$ are denoted by $(x^{1},\\dots,x^{n})$, which are dual to a fixed basis of $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n- The corresponding fiber coordinates on the cotangent bundle $T^{*}\\mathfrak{g}^{*}\\to\\mathfrak{g}^{*}$ are denoted by $(p_{1},\\dots,p_{n})$.\n- The final answer is the expression for the multiplicative symplectic two-form $\\omega$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is mathematically well-defined and concerns standard topics in differential geometry and Lie theory, specifically Poisson geometry and its integration. The concepts of Lie algebras, linear Poisson structures, Lie algebroids, and symplectic groupoids are all standard. The problem of integrating a Poisson manifold to a symplectic groupoid is a central one, and a solution is guaranteed to exist and be unique up to isomorphism (for the source-simply-connected case). The abelian case is the simplest non-trivial example of the general theory of Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau structures and their integration, making it a valid and instructive problem. The givens are complete and consistent. No scientific or logical flaws are present.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution is warranted.\n\n### Solution\n\nWe proceed by following the steps outlined in the problem statement.\n\n**1. Determine the Poisson bivector $\\pi_{\\mathrm{lin}}$ on $\\mathfrak{g}^{*}$**\n\nLet $\\{e_i\\}_{i=1,\\dots,n}$ be a basis for the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$. The linear coordinates $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$ on the dual space $\\mathfrak{g}^*$ are defined by $x^i(\\alpha) = \\alpha(e_i)$ for any $\\alpha \\in \\mathfrak{g}^*$. These functions are the linear functions $\\ell_{e_i}$ associated with the basis vectors.\n\nThe Poisson bracket is defined by $\\{\\ell_X, \\ell_Y\\} = \\ell_{[X,Y]}$ for any $X,Y \\in \\mathfrak{g}$. We apply this definition to the coordinate functions $x^i$ and $x^j$:\n$$\n\\{x^i, x^j\\} = \\{\\ell_{e_i}, \\ell_{e_j}\\} = \\ell_{[e_i, e_j]}\n$$\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is given to be abelian, which means the Lie bracket of any two elements is zero. In particular, for the basis vectors, we have $[e_i, e_j] = 0$ for all $i,j \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$.\nTherefore, the corresponding linear function is $\\ell_{[e_i, e_j]} = \\ell_0 = 0$.\nThis implies that the Poisson brackets of the coordinate functions are all zero:\n$$\n\\{x^i, x^j\\} = 0 \\quad \\forall i,j.\n$$\nThe Poisson bivector $\\pi_{\\mathrm{lin}}$ is given by $\\pi_{\\mathrm{lin}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j=1}^n \\{x^i, x^j\\} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}$. Since all the components $\\{x^i, x^j\\}$ are zero, the Poisson bivector is zero:\n$$\n\\pi_{\\mathrm{lin}} = 0.\n$$\nThe linear Poisson structure on the dual of an abelian Lie algebra is the zero Poisson structure.\n\n**2. Determine the Lie algebroid associated with $(\\mathfrak{g}^{*}, \\pi_{\\mathrm{lin}})$**\n\nFor any Poisson manifold $(M, \\pi)$, its cotangent bundle $T^*M$ is endowed with a Lie algebroid structure. The structure maps are the anchor $\\rho: T^*M \\to TM$ and a Lie bracket on the space of sections $\\Gamma(T^*M) = \\Omega^1(M)$.\nThe anchor map is given by the contraction with the Poisson bivector, $\\rho(\\beta) = \\pi^\\sharp(\\beta)$ for $\\beta \\in T^*M$.\nThe bracket of exact $1$-forms is defined by $[df, dg] = d\\{f,g\\}$ for $f,g \\in C^{\\infty}(M)$.\n\nIn our case, $M = \\mathfrak{g}^*$ and $\\pi = \\pi_{\\mathrm{lin}} = 0$.\n- The anchor map is $\\rho(\\beta) = 0^\\sharp(\\beta) = 0$. Thus, the anchor map is the zero map.\n- The bracket on $1$-forms is $[df, dg] = d\\{f,g\\} = d(\\pi(df,dg)) = d(0) = 0$. Since any $1$-form can be locally written as a sum of functions times exact forms, the Leibniz rule implies the bracket of any two $1$-forms is zero.\n\nThe resulting Lie algebroid is the vector bundle $A = T^*\\mathfrak{g}^*$ over the base $\\mathfrak{g}^*$, equipped with a zero anchor map and a zero Lie bracket on its space of sections. This describes a bundle of abelian Lie algebras.\n\n**3. Integrate the Lie algebroid to a source-simply-connected Lie groupoid**\n\nAccording to Lie's third theorem for Lie algebroids, every Lie algebroid integrates to a unique (up to isomorphism) source-simply-connected Lie groupoid.\nThe Lie groupoid $\\mathcal{G} \\rightrightarrows M$ that integrates a Lie algebroid $A \\to M$ has the property that its Lie algebroid $A(\\mathcal{G})$ is isomorphic to $A$. The fibers of the source map, $s^{-1}(x)$, are Lie groups whose Lie algebra is the fiber $A_x$ of the Lie algebroid. Since the groupoid is source-simply-connected, these fiber groups are the simply connected Lie groups corresponding to the Lie algebras $A_x$.\n\nIn our case, $A = T^*\\mathfrak{g}^* \\to \\mathfrak{g}^*$. For each point $x \\in \\mathfrak{g}^*$, the fiber $A_x = T_x^*\\mathfrak{g}^*$ is an $n$-dimensional vector space. The Lie algebra structure on this fiber (induced from the zero bracket on sections) is abelian.\nThe simply connected Lie group corresponding to an $n$-dimensional abelian Lie algebra is the vector space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with vector addition as the group operation. Here, the group is $T_x^*\\mathfrak{g}^*$ itself, with its vector space addition.\n\n-   **Total Space**: The total space $\\mathcal{G}$ of the groupoid is the union of all fiber groups. This is the total space of the cotangent bundle, so $\\mathcal{G} = T^*\\mathfrak{g}^*$.\n-   **Base Space**: The base is $M = \\mathfrak{g}^*$.\n-   **Source and Target Maps**: A Lie algebroid with a zero anchor map integrates to a Lie groupoid where the source and target maps coincide, $s=t$. These maps are simply the bundle projection $\\pi_{\\mathcal{G}}: \\mathcal{G} \\to M$. For an element $(x,p) \\in T^*\\mathfrak{g}^*$ (where $x \\in \\mathfrak{g}^*$ and $p \\in T_x^*\\mathfrak{g}^*$), we have:\n    $$\n    s(x,p) = x \\quad \\text{and} \\quad t(x,p) = x.\n    $$\n-   **Multiplication**: The multiplication $m: \\mathcal{G}_2 \\to \\mathcal{G}$ is defined on the space of composable pairs $\\mathcal{G}_2 = \\{(g,h) \\in \\mathcal{G} \\times \\mathcal{G} \\mid s(g)=t(h)\\}$. Since $s=t$, this means $m$ is defined for pairs of elements in the same fiber. The multiplication is the group operation in the fiber, which is vector addition. For $g_1=(x, p_1)$ and $g_2=(x, p_2)$:\n    $$\n    m(g_1, g_2) = m((x, p_1), (x, p_2)) = (x, p_1+p_2).\n    $$\n-   **Unit Map**: The unit map $u: M \\to \\mathcal{G}$ sends each point $x$ in the base to the identity element of the fiber group over $x$. The identity for vector addition is the zero vector. So, $u(x) = (x, 0)$. This is the zero section of the cotangent bundle.\n-   **Inversion Map**: The inversion map $i: \\mathcal{G} \\to \\mathcal{G}$ gives the group inverse. For vector addition, the inverse of $p$ is $-p$. So, $i(x,p) = (x, -p)$.\n\nThe resulting structure is a bundle of abelian groups over $\\mathfrak{g}^*$.\n\n**4. Prove that the canonical symplectic form is multiplicative**\n\nThe symplectic groupoid integrating a Poisson manifold $(M, \\pi)$ is a Lie groupoid $\\mathcal{G}$ equipped with a symplectic form $\\omega$ that is multiplicative and for which the unit section is Lagrangian. For $\\mathcal{G} = T^*\\mathfrak{g}^*$, the canonical symplectic form is $\\omega = -d\\theta$, where $\\theta = \\sum_{i=1}^n p_i dx^i$ is the Liouville $1$-form. In the canonical coordinates $(x^1, \\dots, x^n, p_1, \\dots, p_n)$ on $T^*\\mathfrak{g}^*$, this form is:\n$$\n\\omega = \\sum_{i=1}^n dx^i \\wedge dp_i.\n$$\nWe must show this form is multiplicative. A symplectic form $\\omega$ on $\\mathcal{G}$ is multiplicative if $m^*\\omega = \\mathrm{pr}_1^*\\omega + \\mathrm{pr}_2^*\\omega$ on the manifold of composable pairs $\\mathcal{G}_2$.\n\nThe manifold of composable pairs is $\\mathcal{G}_2 = \\{((x,p_1), (x,p_2)) \\in T^*\\mathfrak{g}^* \\times T^*\\mathfrak{g}^* \\}$. We can use $(x^i, p_{1,j}, p_{2,k})$ as coordinates on $\\mathcal{G}_2$. The projection maps are $\\mathrm{pr}_1(x,p_1, p_2) = (x,p_1)$ and $\\mathrm{pr}_2(x,p_1, p_2) = (x,p_2)$. The multiplication map is $m(x,p_1,p_2) = (x, p_1+p_2)$.\n\nLet the coordinates on the target space $\\mathcal{G}$ be $(y^i,q_j)$. The form is $\\omega = \\sum_k dy^k \\wedge dq_k$.\n\n-   **LHS: Computing $m^*\\omega$**:\n    The multiplication map $m$ is given in coordinates by $y^k = x^k$ and $q_k = p_{1,k} + p_{2,k}$. We pull back $\\omega$:\n    $m^*(dy^k) = d(y^k \\circ m) = d(x^k) = dx^k$.\n    $m^*(dq_k) = d(q_k \\circ m) = d(p_{1,k} + p_{2,k}) = dp_{1,k} + dp_{2,k}$.\n    $$\n    m^*\\omega = \\sum_{k=1}^n m^*(dy^k) \\wedge m^*(dq_k) = \\sum_{k=1}^n dx^k \\wedge (dp_{1,k} + dp_{2,k}) = \\sum_{k=1}^n (dx^k \\wedge dp_{1,k} + dx^k \\wedge dp_{2,k}).\n    $$\n\n-   **RHS: Computing $\\mathrm{pr}_1^*\\omega + \\mathrm{pr}_2^*\\omega$**:\n    For $\\mathrm{pr}_1$, the coordinate map is $y^k=x^k, q_k=p_{1,k}$.\n    $\\mathrm{pr}_1^*(dy^k) = d(x^k) = dx^k$.\n    $\\mathrm{pr}_1^*(dq_k) = d(p_{1,k}) = dp_{1,k}$.\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{pr}_1^*\\omega = \\sum_{k=1}^n dx^k \\wedge dp_{1,k}.\n    $$\n    For $\\mathrm{pr}_2$, the coordinate map is $y^k=x^k, q_k=p_{2,k}$.\n    $\\mathrm{pr}_2^*(dy^k) = d(x^k) = dx^k$.\n    $\\mathrm{pr}_2^*(dq_k) = d(p_{2,k}) = dp_{2,k}$.\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{pr}_2^*\\omega = \\sum_{k=1}^n dx^k \\wedge dp_{2,k}.\n    $$\n    Summing these two gives:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{pr}_1^*\\omega + \\mathrm{pr}_2^*\\omega = \\sum_{k=1}^n dx^k \\wedge dp_{1,k} + \\sum_{k=1}^n dx^k \\wedge dp_{2,k}.\n    $$\n\nComparing the LHS and RHS, we see that $m^*\\omega = \\mathrm{pr}_1^*\\omega + \\mathrm{pr}_2^*\\omega$. Thus, the canonical symplectic form on $T^*\\mathfrak{g}^*$ is multiplicative for the groupoid structure we determined.\n\nThe source-simply-connected symplectic Lie groupoid integrating the zero Poisson structure on $\\mathfrak{g}^*$ is the cotangent bundle $T^*\\mathfrak{g}^*$ itself, with its canonical symplectic form $\\omega = \\sum_{i=1}^n dx^i \\wedge dp_i$ and the groupoid structure arising from fiberwise vector addition. The final answer is the expression for this form.",

The solution will now be constructed.\n\n### Solution\nThe base manifold is $P = \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ with the canonical Poisson bivector $\\pi = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\partial_{q_i} \\wedge \\partial_{p_i}$. This Poisson structure is nondegenerate. The inverse of the bivector $\\pi$ is the canonical symplectic $2$-form $\\omega = \\pi^{-1} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} dq_i \\wedge dp_i$. Thus, $(P, \\pi)$ is a symplectic manifold $(P, \\omega)$. The Poisson bracket is given by $\\{f,g\\}_{\\pi} = \\omega^{-1}(df, dg) = \\pi(df, dg)$.\n\nFor a pair groupoid $G = P \\times P$ over a symplectic manifold $(P, \\omega)$, the canonical structure that makes it a symplectic groupoid is given by the $2$-form $\\Omega = t^*\\omega - s^*\\omega$, where $t$ and $s$ are the target and source maps, respectively. We propose this as the required $2$-form.\n\nLet the coordinates on $G = \\mathbb{R}^{2n} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ be $(q_1^{(1)}, \\dots, q_n^{(1)}, p_1^{(1)}, \\dots, p_n^{(1)}, q_1^{(2)}, \\dots, q_n^{(2)}, p_1^{(2)}, \\dots, p_n^{(2)})$, where the superscript $(1)$ denotes coordinates on the target space (the first $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ factor) and $(2)$ on the source space (the second $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ factor).\nThe target map is $t(q^{(1)}, p^{(1)}, q^{(2)}, p^{(2)}) = (q^{(1)}, p^{(1)})$.\nThe source map is $s(q^{(1)}, p^{(1)}, q^{(2)}, p^{(2)}) = (q^{(2)}, p^{(2)})$.\n\nThe pullback of $\\omega = \\sum_{i=1}^n dq_i \\wedge dp_i$ by these maps are:\n$t^*\\omega = \\sum_{i=1}^n d(q_i \\circ t) \\wedge d(p_i \\circ t) = \\sum_{i=1}^n dq_i^{(1)} \\wedge dp_i^{(1)}$.\n$s^*\\omega = \\sum_{i=1}^n d(q_i \\circ s) \\wedge d(p_i \\circ s) = \\sum_{i=1}^n dq_i^{(2)} \\wedge dp_i^{(2)}$.\n\nTherefore, the explicit expression for $\\Omega$ is:\n$$ \\Omega = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( dq_i^{(1)} \\wedge dp_i^{(1)} - dq_i^{(2)} \\wedge dp_i^{(2)} \\right) $$\n\nWe first verify that $\\Omega$ is a symplectic form, i.e., it is closed and nondegenerate.\n1.  **Closedness**: $d\\Omega = d(t^*\\omega - s^*\\omega) = t^*(d\\omega) - s^*(d\\omega)$. Since $\\omega$ is a symplectic form, it is closed, so $d\\omega = 0$. Thus, $d\\Omega = 0$.\n2.  **Nondegeneracy**: In the coordinate basis $\\{dq_i^{(1)}, dp_i^{(1)}, dq_i^{(2)}, dp_i^{(2)}\\}_{i=1}^n$, the matrix representation of $\\Omega$ is a block-diagonal matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} J & 0 \\\\ 0 & -J \\end{pmatrix}$, where $J = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & I_n \\\\ -I_n & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ is the matrix of $\\omega$ and $I_n$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix. The determinant is $\\det(J)\\det(-J) = (\\det J)((-1)^{2n}\\det J) = (\\det J)^2 = 1^2 = 1 \\neq 0$.

The image of the unit embedding $u$ is a Lagrangian submanifold.**\nThe unit map is $u: \\mathbb{R}^{2n} \\to G$, $u(x) = (x,x)$. The image is the diagonal submanifold $\\Delta = \\{(x,x) \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2n}\\} \\subset G$.\nA submanifold is Lagrangian if its dimension is half the dimension of the ambient manifold and the symplectic form vanishes on it.\n- **Dimension**: $\\dim(\\Delta) = \\dim(\\mathbb{R}^{2n}) = 2n$. The ambient manifold is $G=\\mathbb{R}^{2n} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, so $\\dim(G) = 4n$. The dimension condition $\\dim(\\Delta) = \\frac{1}{2}\\dim(G)$ is satisfied.\n- **Vanishing form**: To check if $\\Omega$ vanishes on $\\Delta$, we compute its pullback $u^*\\Omega$.\n$$ u^*\\Omega = u^*(t^*\\omega - s^*\\omega) = (t \\circ u)^*\\omega - (s \\circ u)^*\\omega $$\nBy definition, for any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, we have $t(u(x)) = t(x,x) = x$ and $s(u(x)) = s(x,x) = x$. Thus, $t \\circ u = \\text{id}_{\\mathbb{R}^{2n}}$ and $s \\circ u = \\text{id}_{\\mathbb{R}^{2n}}$.\n$$ u^*\\Omega = (\\text{id}_{\\mathbb{R}^{2n}})^*\\omega - (\\text{id}_{\\mathbb{R}^{2n}})^*\\omega = \\omega - \\omega = 0 $$\nSince $u^*\\Omega = 0$, the form $\\Omega$ vanishes on the tangent spaces of the image of $u$. The image of $u$ is a Lagrangian submanifold of $(G, \\Omega)$.\n\n**2. The multiplicativity condition $m^{*}\\Omega=\\operatorname{pr}_{1}^{*}\\Omega+\\operatorname{pr}_{2}^{*}\\Omega$ holds.**\nThe space of composable pairs is $G^{(2)} = \\{ ((x,y), (y,z)) \\mid x,y,z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2n} \\}$.\nThe maps are: $m((x,y),(y,z))=(x,z)$, $\\operatorname{pr}_1((x,y),(y,z))=(x,y)$, $\\operatorname{pr}_2((x,y),(y,z))=(y,z)$.\nLet's compute the LHS, $m^*\\Omega$:\n$$ m^*\\Omega = m^*(t^*\\omega - s^*\\omega) = (t \\circ m)^*\\omega - (s \\circ m)^*\\omega $$\nThe compositions are: $t(m((x,y),(y,z))) = t(x,z) = x$ and $s(m((x,y),(y,z))) = s(x,z) = z$. Let $\\pi_x, \\pi_y, \\pi_z$ be the projections of $G^{(2)}$ onto its $x, y, z$ components. Then $t \\circ m = \\pi_x$ and $s \\circ m = \\pi_z$.\n$$ m^*\\Omega = \\pi_x^*\\omega - \\pi_z^*\\omega $$\nNow compute the RHS, $\\operatorname{pr}_{1}^{*}\\Omega+\\operatorname{pr}_{2}^{*}\\Omega$:\n$$ \\operatorname{pr}_1^*\\Omega = (t \\circ \\operatorname{pr}_1)^*\\omega - (s \\circ \\operatorname{pr}_1)^*\\omega = \\pi_x^*\\omega - \\pi_y^*\\omega $$\n$$ \\operatorname{pr}_2^*\\Omega = (t \\circ \\operatorname{pr}_2)^*\\omega - (s \\circ \\operatorname{pr}_2)^*\\omega = \\pi_y^*\\omega - \\pi_z^*\\omega $$\nAdding these two expressions gives:\n$$ \\operatorname{pr}_1^*\\Omega + \\operatorname{pr}_2^*\\Omega = (\\pi_x^*\\omega - \\pi_y^*\\omega) + (\\pi_y^*\\omega - \\pi_z^*\\omega) = \\pi_x^*\\omega - \\pi_z^*\\omega $$\nComparing LHS and RHS, we confirm $m^*\\Omega = \\operatorname{pr}_1^*\\Omega + \\operatorname{pr}_2^*\\Omega$.\n\n**3. Poisson bracket relations.**\nThe Poisson bivector $\\Pi$ on $G$ is the inverse of the symplectic form $\\Omega$. From the matrix of $\\Omega$, $\\begin{pmatrix} J & 0 \\\\ 0 & -J \\end{pmatrix}$, the matrix of $\\Pi$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} J^{-1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & (-J)^{-1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -J & 0 \\\\ 0 & J \\end{pmatrix}$. This corresponds to the bivector:\n$$ \\Pi = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\partial_{q_i^{(1)}} \\wedge \\partial_{p_i^{(1)}} - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\partial_{q_i^{(2)}} \\wedge \\partial_{p_i^{(2)}} $$\nThe Poisson bracket on $(G, \\Omega)$ is $\\{F,K\\}_\\Omega = \\Pi(dF, dK)$.\n\n- **Target map $t$ is Poisson**: We verify $\\{t^*f, t^*g\\}_\\Omega = t^*\\{f,g\\}_\\pi$ for $f,g \\in C^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}^{2n})$.\nLet $F = t^*f$ and $K = t^*g$. These functions depend only on the $(q^{(1)}, p^{(1)})$ coordinates.\n$dF = \\sum_i (\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q_i} \\circ t) dq_i^{(1)} + (\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_i} \\circ t) dp_i^{(1)}$. The differential $dK$ is analogous.\n$\\{F,K\\}_\\Omega = \\Pi(dF,dK)$. Since $dF$ and $dK$ have no components in the $(q^{(2)}, p^{(2)})$ directions, the second term of $\\Pi$ gives zero.\n$$ \\{t^*f, t^*g\\}_\\Omega = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\partial_{q_i^{(1)}} \\wedge \\partial_{p_i^{(1)}}\\right)(d(f \\circ t), d(g \\circ t)) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\frac{\\partial (f \\circ t)}{\\partial q_i^{(1)}} \\frac{\\partial (g \\circ t)}{\\partial p_i^{(1)}} - \\frac{\\partial (f \\circ t)}{\\partial p_i^{(1)}} \\frac{\\partial (g \\circ t)}{\\partial q_i^{(1)}} \\right) $$\n$$ = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q_i}\\right)\\circ t \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p_i}\\right)\\circ t - \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_i}\\right)\\circ t \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial q_i}\\right)\\circ t \\right) = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q_i}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p_i} - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_i}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial q_i}\\right)\\right)\\circ t = \\{f,g\\}_\\pi \\circ t = t^*\\{f,g\\}_\\pi $$\n- **Source map $s$ is anti-Poisson**: We verify $\\{s^*f, s^*g\\}_\\Omega = -s^*\\{f,g\\}_\\pi$.\nLet $F = s^*f, K = s^*g$. These functions depend only on $(q^{(2)}, p^{(2)})$. Their differentials have no components in the $(q^{(1)}, p^{(1)})$ directions, so the first term of $\\Pi$ gives zero.\n$$ \\{s^*f, s^*g\\}_\\Omega = \\left(-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\partial_{q_i^{(2)}} \\wedge \\partial_{p_i^{(2)}}\\right)(d(f \\circ s), d(g \\circ s)) = -\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\frac{\\partial (f \\circ s)}{\\partial q_i^{(2)}} \\frac{\\partial (g \\circ s)}{\\partial p_i^{(2)}} - \\frac{\\partial (f \\circ s)}{\\partial p_i^{(2)}} \\frac{\\partial (g \\circ s)}{\\partial q_i^{(2)}} \\right) $$\n$$ = -\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q_i}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p_i} - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_i}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial q_i}\\right)\\right)\\circ s = -\\{f,g\\}_\\pi \\circ s = -s^*\\{f,g\\}_\\pi $$\n\n**4. Hamiltonian vector fields.**\nThe Hamiltonian vector field $X_F$ on $(G,\\Omega)$ is defined by the relation $i_{X_F} \\Omega = -dF$. The Hamiltonian vector field $X_f$ on $(\\mathbb{R}^{2n}, \\pi)$ is $X_f = \\sum_i (\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_i} \\partial_{q_i} - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q_i} \\partial_{p_i})$.\n\n- **Analysis of $X_{t^*f}$**: Let $F=t^*f$. Then $dF = \\sum_i ((\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q_i}\\circ t)dq_i^{(1)} + (\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_i}\\circ t)dp_i^{(1)})$.\nLet $X_{t^*f} = A + B$, where $A$ is in the span of $\\{\\partial_{q_i^{(1)}}, \\partial_{p_i^{(1)}}\\}$ and $B$ in the span of $\\{\\partial_{q_i^{(2)}}, \\partial_{p_i^{(2)}}\\}$.\n$i_{X_{t^*f}}\\Omega = i_A(\\sum_i dq_i^{(1)} \\wedge dp_i^{(1)}) - i_B(\\sum_i dq_i^{(2)} \\wedge dp_i^{(2)}) = -d(t^*f)$.\nBy comparing terms, the second term must be zero, so $i_B=0$ and thus $B=0$. The first term gives $i_A(\\sum_i dq_i^{(1)} \\wedge dp_i^{(1)}) = -d(t^*f)$. This equation defines the Hamiltonian vector field for $f\\circ t$ on the first component, which is just $X_f \\circ t$. So, $X_{t^*f} = \\sum_i ((\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_i}\\circ t)\\partial_{q_i^{(1)}} - (\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q_i}\\circ t)\\partial_{p_i^{(1)}})$. At a point $(x,y) \\in G$, this vector is $(X_f(x), 0_y) \\in T_x\\mathbb{R}^{2n} \\times T_y\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$.\n- **Right-invariance**: A vector field $Y$ on $G$ is right-invariant if $s_*Y=0$ and for all composable $(g,h)$, $dm_{(g,h)}((Y(g),0)) = Y(gh)$. For $g=(x,y), h=(y,z)$, $gh=(x,z)$. $Y=X_{t^*f}$.\n$s_*(X_{t^*f})$ pushes forward a vector with zero second component, so $s_*(X_{t^*f})=0$.\n$dm_{((x,y),(y,z))}((X_{t^*f}(x,y), 0_{(y,z)})) = dm ((X_f(x),0_y), (0,0)) = (X_f(x), 0_z) = X_{t^*f}(x,z) = X_{t^*f}(gh)$. It holds.\n- **$t$-relatedness**: We check if $t_*(X_{t^*f}) = X_f \\circ t$.\n$t_*(X_{t^*f}(x,y)) = t_*(X_f(x), 0_y) = X_f(x)$. Since $x=t(x,y)$, this is $X_f(t(x,y))$. It holds.\n\n- **Analysis of $X_{s^*f}$**: Let $F=s^*f$. Then $dF = \\sum_i ((\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q_i}\\circ s)dq_i^{(2)} + (\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_i}\\circ s)dp_i^{(2)})$.\n$i_{X_{s^*f}}\\Omega = -dF$ leads to $i_{X_{s^*f}}(-\\sum_i dq_i^{(2)} \\wedge dp_i^{(2)}) = -d(s^*f)$. This implies that $X_{s^*f}$ has components only in the span of $\\{\\partial_{q_i^{(2)}}, \\partial_{p_i^{(2)}}\\}$, and equals $X_f \\circ s$. So, $X_{s^*f} = \\sum_i ((\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_i}\\circ s)\\partial_{q_i^{(2)}} - (\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q_i}\\circ s)\\partial_{p_i^{(2)}})$. At a point $(x,y) \\in G$, this vector is $(0_x, X_f(y))$.\n- **Left-invariance**: A vector field $Y$ on $G$ is left-invariant if $t_*Y=0$ and for all composable $(g,h)$, $dm_{(g,h)}((0,Y(h))) = Y(gh)$. Let $Y=X_{s^*f}$, $g=(x,y), h=(y,z)$.\n$t_*(X_{s^*f})$ pushes forward a vector with zero first component, so $t_*(X_{s^*f})=0$.\n$dm_{((x,y),(y,z))}((0_{(x,y)}, X_{s^*f}(y,z))) = dm ((0,0), (0_y,X_f(z))) = (0_x, X_f(z)) = X_{s^*f}(x,z) = X_{s^*f}(gh)$. It holds.\n- **$s$-relatedness**: We check if $s_*(X_{s^*f}) = X_f \\circ s$.\n$s_*(X_{s^*f}(x,y)) = s_*(0_x, X_f(y)) = X_f(y)$. Since $y=s(x,y)$, this is $X_f(s(x,y))$. It holds.\n\nAll properties have been verified from first principles. The derived expression for $\\Omega$ is correct and fulfills all requirements.",

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded within the framework of geometric mechanics and Lie theory. We shall proceed by addressing each of the three parts in sequence.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the source and target maps.\nThe symplectic groupoid integrating the Lie-Poisson manifold $(\\mathfrak{g}^{*}, \\{\\cdot, \\cdot\\})$ is the cotangent bundle $T^{*}G$ with its canonical symplectic structure, viewed as a groupoid over the base manifold of objects $\\mathfrak{g}^{*}$. An element of this groupoid is a covector $\\alpha_{g} \\in T_{g}^{*}G$ for some $g \\in G$.\n\nThe source map $s \\colon T^{*}G \\to \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$ and target map $t \\colon T^{*}G \\to \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$ are defined by pulling back the covector $\\alpha_{g}$ to the cotangent space at the identity, $T_{e}^{*}G \\cong \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$, using right and left translations, respectively. Let $L_{g}(h) = gh$ and $R_{g}(h) = hg$ be the left and right translation maps on $G$. Their differentials at a point $h$ are $T_{h}L_{g} \\colon T_{h}G \\to T_{gh}G$ and $T_{h}R_{g} \\colon T_{h}G \\to T_{hg}G$. The dual maps are $(T_{h}L_{g})^{*} \\colon T_{gh}^{*}G \\to T_{h}^{*}G$ and $(T_{h}R_{g})^{*} \\colon T_{hg}^{*}G \\to T_{h}^{*}G$.\n\nThe source and target maps for an element $\\alpha_{g} \\in T_{g}^{*}G$ are defined as:\n$$\ns(\\alpha_{g}) \\coloneqq (T_{e}R_{g})^{*} \\alpha_{g} \\in T_{e}^{*}G \\cong \\mathfrak{g}^{*}\n$$\n$$\nt(\\alpha_{g}) \\coloneqq (T_{e}L_{g})^{*} \\alpha_{g} \\in T_{e}^{*}G \\cong \\mathfrak{g}^{*}\n$$\nNote that $T_{e}R_{g} \\colon T_{e}G \\to T_{g}G$ and $T_{e}L_{g} \\colon T_{e}G \\to T_{g}G$.\n\nThe problem specifies the use of the left-trivialization of the cotangent bundle, $T^{*}G \\cong G \\times \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$. An element of $T^*G$ is represented by a pair $(g, \\mu)$, where $g \\in G$ and $\\mu \\in \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$. This identification is given by the relation $\\mu = (T_{e}L_{g})^{*}\\alpha_{g}$, where $\\alpha_g$ is the covector at $g$ corresponding to the pair $(g, \\mu)$.\n\nWe can now express the source and target maps in terms of these $(g, \\mu)$ coordinates.\n\nFor the target map $t \\colon G \\times \\mathfrak{g}^{*} \\to \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$, we have:\n$$\nt(g, \\mu) = t(\\alpha_{g}) = (T_{e}L_{g})^{*}\\alpha_{g}\n$$\nBy the very definition of the coordinate $\\mu$, we immediately get:\n$$\nt(g, \\mu) = \\mu\n$$\n\nFor the source map $s \\colon G \\times \\mathfrak{g}^{*} \\to \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$, we first express $\\alpha_{g}$ in terms of $\\mu$. From the definition $\\mu = (T_{e}L_{g})^{*}\\alpha_{g}$, we find $\\alpha_{g} = ((T_{e}L_{g})^{*})^{-1}\\mu$. The inverse of the dual map $(T_{e}L_{g})^{*}$ is the dual of the inverse map's differential. The inverse of $L_{g}$ is $L_{g^{-1}}$. The map $T_{e}L_{g} \\colon T_{e}G \\to T_{g}G$ has an inverse $(T_{e}L_{g})^{-1} = T_{g}L_{g^{-1}} \\colon T_{g}G \\to T_{e}G$. Thus, $((T_{e}L_{g})^{*})^{-1} = (T_{g}L_{g^{-1}})^{*}$. So, $\\alpha_{g} = (T_{g}L_{g^{-1}})^{*}\\mu$.\nNow we compute $s(g, \\mu)$:\n$$\ns(g, \\mu) = s(\\alpha_{g}) = (T_{e}R_{g})^{*}\\alpha_{g} = (T_{e}R_{g})^{*} (T_{g}L_{g^{-1}})^{*} \\mu\n$$\nUsing the contravariant functoriality of the pullback, $(A \\circ B)^{*} = B^{*} \\circ A^{*}$, we can combine the operators:\n$$\ns(g, \\mu) = (L_{g^{-1}} \\circ R_{g})^{*}_{e} \\mu\n$$\nLet's analyze the map $L_{g^{-1}} \\circ R_{g} \\colon G \\to G$. For any $h \\in G$, this map acts as $h \\mapsto L_{g^{-1}}(R_{g}(h)) = L_{g^{-1}}(hg) = g^{-1}hg$. This is the conjugation map $C_{g^{-1}}(h) \\coloneqq g^{-1}hg$. We need its differential at the identity, $T_{e}C_{g^{-1}} \\colon T_{e}G \\to T_{e}G$. This map is by definition the Adjoint action $\\operatorname{Ad}_{g^{-1}} \\colon \\mathfrak{g} \\to \\mathfrak{g}$.\nTherefore, the dual map $(L_{g^{-1}} \\circ R_{g})^{*}_{e}$ is the dual of the Adjoint action, which is the coadjoint action $\\operatorname{Ad}_{g^{-1}}^{*} \\colon \\mathfrak{g}^{*} \\to \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$.\nSo, we find the expression for the source map:\n$$\ns(g, \\mu) = \\operatorname{Ad}_{g^{-1}}^{*}(\\mu)\n$$\nIn summary, for the left-trivialization $T^*G \\cong G \\times \\mathfrak{g}^*$, the source and target maps are given by:\n$$\ns(g, \\mu) = \\operatorname{Ad}_{g^{-1}}^{*}(\\mu) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad t(g, \\mu) = \\mu\n$$\n\nPart 2: Invariance of coadjoint orbits.\nA coadjoint orbit $\\mathcal{O}_{\\xi}$ through a point $\\xi \\in \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$ is the set of all points that can be reached from $\\xi$ by the coadjoint action of the group $G$. That is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{O}_{\\xi} = \\{ \\operatorname{Ad}_{h}^{*}(\\xi) \\mid h \\in G \\}\n$$\nWe need to show that for any pair $(g, \\mu) \\in G \\times \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$, the points $s(g, \\mu)$ and $t(g, \\mu)$ lie on the same coadjoint orbit.\nLet's consider the coadjoint orbit through the point $\\mu \\in \\mathfrak{g}^{*}$, which is $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mu} = \\{ \\operatorname{Ad}_{h}^{*}(\\mu) \\mid h \\in G \\}$.\n\nFrom Part 1, the target image is $t(g, \\mu) = \\mu$. This point can be written as $\\operatorname{Ad}_{e}^{*}(\\mu)$, where $e \\in G$ is the identity element. Since $e \\in G$, the point $\\mu$ is, by definition, an element of the coadjoint orbit $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mu}$.\n\nFrom Part 1, the source image is $s(g, \\mu) = \\operatorname{Ad}_{g^{-1}}^{*}(\\mu)$. Since $g \\in G$, its inverse $g^{-1}$ is also in $G$. Thus, the point $\\operatorname{Ad}_{g^{-1}}^{*}(\\mu)$ is of the form $\\operatorname{Ad}_{h}^{*}(\\mu)$ with $h = g^{-1} \\in G$. By definition, this point is also an element of the coadjoint orbit $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mu}$.\n\nSince both $s(g, \\mu)$ and $t(g, \\mu)$ belong to the same coadjoint orbit $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mu}$, the claim is proven. This property is fundamental to the structure of a symplectic groupoid, as the symplectic leaves of the base Poisson manifold $(\\mathfrak{g}^{*}, \\{\\cdot, \\cdot\\})$ are precisely the coadjoint orbits.\n\nPart 3: Calculation for $G = \\mathrm{SO}(3)$.\nWe specialize to the case where $G = \\mathrm{SO}(3)$, the group of special orthogonal $3 \\times 3$ matrices. Its Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{so}(3)$ consists of $3 \\times 3$ skew-symmetric matrices. The problem states that $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$ is identified with $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ such that the Lie bracket corresponds to the vector cross product. Furthermore, the dual space $\\mathfrak{so}(3)^{*}$ is identified with $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ via an invariant inner product (dot product), which also identifies $\\mathfrak{so}(3) \\cong \\mathfrak{so}(3)^{*}$. Under these identifications, the coadjoint action $\\operatorname{Ad}_{g}^{*}(\\mu)$ on $\\mu \\in \\mathfrak{g}^{*} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ for $g \\in \\mathrm{SO}(3)$ simplifies to the standard action of the rotation matrix $g$ on the vector $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ad}_{g}^{*}(\\mu) = g\\mu\n$$\nConsequently, the source and target maps in our specific case are:\n$$\nt(g, \\mu) = \\mu\n$$\n$$\ns(g, \\mu) = \\operatorname{Ad}_{g^{-1}}^{*}(\\mu) = g^{-1}\\mu\n$$\nThe problem gives $g$ as a rotation by an angle $\\theta$ about the $z$-axis. Its matrix representation is:\n$$\ng = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta) & -\\sin(\\theta) & 0 \\\\ \\sin(\\theta) & \\cos(\\theta) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe inverse $g^{-1}$ is a rotation by $-\\theta$ about the same axis:\n$$\ng^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta) & \\sin(\\theta) & 0 \\\\ -\\sin(\\theta) & \\cos(\\theta) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe point $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is given as $\\mu = a\\,e_{x}$ for some $a > 0$, where $e_{x}$ is the unit vector along the $x$-axis. In column vector form:\n$$\n\\mu = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe now compute the source and target images. The target image is simply:\n$$\nt(g, \\mu) = \\mu = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe source image is:\n$$\ns(g, \\mu) = g^{-1}\\mu = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta) & \\sin(\\theta) & 0 \\\\ -\\sin(\\theta) & \\cos(\\theta) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a\\cos(\\theta) \\\\ -a\\sin(\\theta) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe are asked to compute the squared Euclidean distance $\\| s(g, \\mu) - t(g, \\mu) \\|^{2}$. First, we find the difference vector:\n$$\ns(g, \\mu) - t(g, \\mu) = \\begin{pmatrix} a\\cos(\\theta) \\\\ -a\\sin(\\theta) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a(\\cos(\\theta) - 1) \\\\ -a\\sin(\\theta) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we compute the squared magnitude (norm) of this vector:\n$$\n\\| s(g, \\mu) - t(g, \\mu) \\|^{2} = (a(\\cos(\\theta) - 1))^{2} + (-a\\sin(\\theta))^{2} + 0^{2}\n$$\n$$\n= a^{2}(\\cos^{2}(\\theta) - 2\\cos(\\theta) + 1) + a^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\theta)\n$$\n$$\n= a^{2}(\\cos^{2}(\\theta) + \\sin^{2}(\\theta) - 2\\cos(\\theta) + 1)\n$$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\cos^{2}(\\theta) + \\sin^{2}(\\theta) = 1$:\n$$\n= a^{2}(1 - 2\\cos(\\theta) + 1)\n$$\n$$\n= a^{2}(2 - 2\\cos(\\theta))\n$$\n$$\n= 2a^{2}(1 - \\cos(\\theta))\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression in terms of the parameters $a$ and $\\theta$.",
