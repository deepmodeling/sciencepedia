By considering two vector fields that are scalar multiples of each other, you will see firsthand how the formula simplifies when the Lie bracket vanishes, reinforcing the idea that the BCH series is a correction to simple addition for non-commuting elements . This practice provides a crucial baseline for understanding the more complex, non-commutative scenarios.",

Starting from the definitions of flows of vector fields and the exponential map from a Lie algebra to its Lie group, determine $Z(\\lambda)$ explicitly as a formal power series in $\\lambda$, and give the closed-form expression in terms of $X$ and $\\lambda$. Express your final answer as a single simplified analytic expression.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of differential geometry and Lie theory, is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. The problem asks for the computation of $Z(\\lambda) = \\log\\big(\\exp(X)\\exp(Y)\\big)$ within the Lie algebra of Hamiltonian vector fields $\\mathfrak{X}_{\\mathrm{Ham}}(M)$, where $Y = \\lambda X$ for a scalar $\\lambda$.\n\nThe expression for $Z(\\lambda)$ is given by the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula. For two elements $A$ and $B$ in a general Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, the product of their exponentials in the corresponding Lie group $G$ can be written as the exponential of another element $C \\in \\mathfrak{g}$. The BCH formula provides an explicit series expression for $C = \\log(\\exp(A)\\exp(B))$ in terms of $A$, $B$, and their repeated commutators. The formula begins:\n$$\n\\log(\\exp(A)\\exp(B)) = A + B + \\frac{1}{2}[A, B] + \\frac{1}{12}\\left([A, [A, B]] - [B, [A, B]]\\right) + \\mathcal{O}(A,B)^3\n$$\nwhere $[A, B] = AB - BA$ is the Lie bracket in the algebra of matrices, or more generally, the abstract Lie bracket operation in $\\mathfrak{g}$. In our context, $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{X}_{\\mathrm{Ham}}(M)$, and the Lie bracket is the standard bracket of vector fields, $[X_1, X_2] = X_1 X_2 - X_2 X_1$ (acting on smooth functions).\n\nIn this problem, we are given two vector fields, $X$ and $Y$, which are elements of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{X}_{\\mathrm{Ham}}(M)$. We are asked to compute:\n$$\nZ(\\lambda) = \\log\\big(\\exp(X)\\exp(Y)\\big)\n$$\nWe can apply the BCH formula with $A = X$ and $B = Y$. The crucial piece of information provided is the relationship between $X$ and $Y$:\n$$\nY = \\lambda X\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is a real scalar parameter.\n\nLet us compute the first commutator term in the BCH series, $[X, Y]$. Substituting the definition of $Y$:\n$$\n[X, Y] = [X, \\lambda X]\n$$\nThe Lie bracket is a bilinear operation. This means it is linear in each of its arguments. For scalars $a, b$ and Lie algebra elements $U, V, W$:\n$$\n[aU + bV, W] = a[U, W] + b[V, W]\n$$\n$$\n[W, aU + bV] = a[W, U] + b[W, V]\n$$\nUsing linearity in the second argument, we can factor out the scalar $\\lambda$:\n$$\n[X, \\lambda X] = \\lambda [X, X]\n$$\nThe Lie bracket is also anti-symmetric, which means $[U, V] = -[V, U]$ for any $U, V \\in \\mathfrak{g}$. A direct consequence of this property is that the bracket of any element with itself is zero:\n$$\n[X, X] = -[X, X] \\implies 2[X, X] = 0 \\implies [X, X] = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the commutator of $X$ and $Y$ is:\n$$\n[X, Y] = \\lambda [X, X] = \\lambda \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\nSo, the vector fields $X$ and $Y$ commute.\n\nNow we examine the full BCH series. All terms of order two and higher in the series are constructed from nested Lie brackets, all of which contain at least one instance of the fundamental commutator $[X, Y]$. For example, the third-order terms are $[X, [X, Y]]$ and $[Y, [X, Y]]$. Since $[X, Y] = 0$, these terms evaluate to:\n$$\n[X, [X, Y]] = [X, 0] = 0\n$$\n$$\n[Y, [X, Y]] = [Y, 0] = 0\n$$\nBy induction, every higher-order commutator term in the BCH series will be zero. The series thus truncates, leaving only the linear terms:\n$$\n\\log(\\exp(X)\\exp(Y)) = X + Y + 0 + 0 + \\dots = X + Y\n$$\nThis is a general result for any two commuting elements in a Lie algebra.\n\nWe can now find the explicit expression for $Z(\\lambda)$ by substituting $Y = \\lambda X$ into this simplified result:\n$$\nZ(\\lambda) = X + \\lambda X\n$$\nFactoring out the common vector field $X$, we obtain the closed-form expression:\n$$\nZ(\\lambda) = (1 + \\lambda)X\n$$\nThis expression is the result, interpreted as an element of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{X}_{\\mathrm{Ham}}(M)$. The problem asks for this result as a formal power series in $\\lambda$. The expression $Z(\\lambda) = X + \\lambda X$ is already a polynomial in $\\lambda$ (a finite power series), where the coefficient of $\\lambda^0$ is $X$, the coefficient of $\\lambda^1$ is $X$, and all higher-order coefficients are $0$. The closed-form expression is simply $(1 + \\lambda)X$.\n\nThe fact that $X$ and $Y$ belong to the Lie algebra of Hamiltonian vector fields on a symplectic manifold $(M, \\omega)$ and that $\\exp(X)$ is a symplectomorphism provides the formal setting for the problem, confirming that we are working within a valid Lie group-Lie algebra framework. However, the calculation itself is purely algebraic and relies only on the properties of the Lie bracket and the specific relationship between $X$ and $Y$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is valid. It presents a well-defined question within the established mathematical framework of Lie theory and its application to geometric mechanics. All provided information is consistent, objective, and sufficient to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula provides an expression for an element $Z$ in a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ such that $\\exp(Z) = \\exp(X)\\exp(Y)$ for $X, Y \\in \\mathfrak{g}$. The formula is a formal series:\n$$Z = \\ln(\\exp(X)\\exp(Y)) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} Z_k(X, Y)$$\nwhere $Z_k(X, Y)$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $k$ in $X$ and $Y$. The crucial property of the BCH formula is that every term is a rational linear combination of nested Lie brackets of $X$ and $Y$. For instance, the first few terms are:\n$$Z = (X+Y) + \\frac{1}{2}[X,Y] + \\frac{1}{12}([X,[X,Y]] + [Y,[Y,X]]) - \\frac{1}{24}[Y,[X,[X,Y]]] + \\dots$$\nThe term $Z_k(X, Y)$ is a sum of Lie polynomials, each of which is a nested Lie bracket of total degree $k$. A Lie bracket of total degree $k$ involves $k$ elements from the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\nThe structure of nested Lie brackets is captured by the lower central series of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$. This series is defined recursively as:\n$$ \\gamma_1(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\mathfrak{g} $$\n$$ \\gamma_{k+1}(\\mathfrak{g}) = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\gamma_k(\\mathfrak{g})] $$\nwhere $[\\mathfrak{g}, \\gamma_k(\\mathfrak{g})]$ denotes the subspace spanned by all Lie brackets $[A, B]$ with $A \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ and $B \\in \\gamma_k(\\mathfrak{g})$.\n\nLet us examine the contents of these subspaces.\n- $\\gamma_1(\\mathfrak{g})$ contains elements of degree $1$ such as $X$ and $Y$.\n- $\\gamma_2(\\mathfrak{g}) = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}]$ is the span of all commutators of length $2$, such as $[X, Y]$.\n- $\\gamma_3(\\mathfrak{g}) = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\gamma_2(\\mathfrak{g})]$ is the span of all commutators of length $3$, such as $[X, [X, Y]]$ or $[Y, [X, Y]]$.\nBy induction, any nested Lie bracket of length $k$ (i.e., a Lie polynomial of degree $k$) is an element of $\\gamma_k(\\mathfrak{g})$. For example, an element of the form $[A_1, [A_2, \\dots, [A_{k-1}, A_k]\\dots]]$ with $A_i \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ belongs to $\\gamma_k(\\mathfrak{g})$.\nConsequently, any term $Z_k(X, Y)$ in the BCH series, being a linear combination of nested Lie brackets of degree $k$, must be an element of $\\gamma_k(\\mathfrak{g})$.\n\nThe problem states that the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent of class $c$, where $c \\in \\mathbb{N}$. By definition, this means that the lower central series terminates at the $(c+1)$-th step, i.e.,\n$$ \\gamma_{c+1}(\\mathfrak{g}) = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\gamma_c(\\mathfrak{g})] = \\{0\\} $$\nwhile the $c$-th term is non-trivial:\n$$ \\gamma_c(\\mathfrak{g}) \\neq \\{0\\} $$\nThe condition $\\gamma_{c+1}(\\mathfrak{g})=\\{0\\}$ implies that any Lie bracket of length $c+1$ is zero. Since the lower central series is a descending chain of subspaces, $\\gamma_{k+1}(\\mathfrak{g}) \\subseteq \\gamma_k(\\mathfrak{g})$, it follows that $\\gamma_k(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\{0\\}$ for all $k \\geq c+1$.\n\nWe can now explain why the BCH series for $Z$ terminates. Each term $Z_k(X, Y)$ in the series belongs to the subspace $\\gamma_k(\\mathfrak{g})$. For any $k \\geq c+1$, we have $\\gamma_k(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\{0\\}$. Therefore, a term of homogeneous bracket degree $k \\geq c+1$ must be zero:\n$$ Z_k(X, Y) \\in \\gamma_k(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\{0\\} \\quad \\text{for all } k \\geq c+1 $$\nThis means all terms in the BCH series of degree $c+1$ and higher vanish. The infinite series truncates to a finite sum, becoming a polynomial in $X$ and $Y$:\n$$ Z = \\sum_{k=1}^{c} Z_k(X, Y) $$\nThis demonstrates that the BCH series terminates.\n\nTo determine the maximal homogeneous bracket degree that can appear in $Z$, we examine the last potentially non-zero term. The last term in the truncated series is $Z_c(X, Y)$. This term lies in the subspace $\\gamma_c(\\mathfrak{g})$. The problem specifies that $\\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent of class $c$, which includes the condition $\\gamma_c(\\mathfrak{g}) \\neq \\{0\\}$. Since this subspace is not the zero subspace, it is possible for $Z_c(X, Y)$ to be non-zero for some choice of $X, Y \\in \\mathfrak{g}$. For example, if we pick generators $X, Y$ such that some Lie polynomial of degree $c$ in them is non-zero, a term of degree $c$ will appear in $Z$. All terms of degree higher than $c$ are guaranteed to be zero.\nTherefore, the maximal homogeneous bracket degree that can appear in the expression for $Z$ is precisely $c$.",
