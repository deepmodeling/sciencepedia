            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of classical Hamiltonian mechanics and KAM theory, self-contained, well-posed, objective, and presents a standard, solvable exercise in the field.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by deriving the required quantities from first principles.\n\nThe system is an integrable Hamiltonian system with $n$ degrees of freedom, described by action-angle variables $(I, \\theta) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\times \\mathbb{T}^{n}$. The unperturbed Hamiltonian is given by:\n$$\nH_{0}(I) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{j} I_{j}^{2}\n$$\nwhere $a_{j} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ are constants and $I = (I_1, \\dots, I_n)$ are the action variables.\n\nFirst, we derive the frequency map $\\omega(I)$. The frequency map for an integrable system with Hamiltonian $H_0(I)$ is defined by the time evolution of the angle variables, which is given by Hamilton's equations.\nHamilton's equations for the canonical coordinates $(I_i, \\theta_i)$ are:\n$$\n\\dot{I}_{i} = -\\frac{\\partial H_{0}}{\\partial \\theta_{i}}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{\\theta}_{i} = \\frac{\\partial H_{0}}{\\partial I_{i}}\n$$\nSince the Hamiltonian $H_0(I)$ depends only on the action variables $I$, the first set of equations yields:\n$$\n\\dot{I}_{i} = -\\frac{\\partial H_{0}}{\\partial \\theta_{i}} = 0\n$$\nThis confirms that the actions $I_i$ are constants of motion, which is the characteristic feature of an integrable system expressed in action-angle coordinates.\n\nThe second set of equations gives the frequencies of motion on the invariant tori. The frequency vector, or frequency map, $\\omega(I) = (\\omega_1(I), \\dots, \\omega_n(I))$ has components $\\omega_i(I) = \\dot{\\theta}_{i}$. Therefore, we compute:\n$$\n\\omega_{i}(I) = \\frac{\\partial H_{0}}{\\partial I_{i}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial I_{i}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{j} I_{j}^{2} \\right)\n$$\nThe partial derivative acts on the sum. Since the variables $I_j$ are independent, the derivative $\\frac{\\partial I_j^2}{\\partial I_i}$ is non-zero only when $j=i$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial I_{j}^{2}}{\\partial I_{i}} = 2 I_{j} \\delta_{ij}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\omega_i(I)$:\n$$\n\\omega_{i}(I) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{j} (2 I_{j} \\delta_{ij}) = \\frac{1}{2} (a_{i} \\cdot 2 I_{i}) = a_{i} I_{i}\n$$\nThus, the frequency map is the vector function $\\omega: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ given by:\n$$\n\\omega(I) = (a_{1}I_{1}, a_{2}I_{2}, \\dots, a_{n}I_{n})\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the frequency map, $\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial I}(I)$. The elements of this matrix, which we denote as $J$, are given by $J_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial \\omega_i}{\\partial I_j}$.\nUsing the expression for $\\omega_i(I)$ we just derived:\n$$\nJ_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial \\omega_{i}}{\\partial I_{j}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial I_{j}} (a_{i}I_{i})\n$$\nThis partial derivative is $a_i$ if $j=i$, and $0$ if $j \\neq i$.\n$$\nJ_{ij} = a_{i} \\delta_{ij}\n$$\nTherefore, the Jacobian matrix is a diagonal matrix:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial I}(I) = \\begin{pmatrix}\na_1 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n0 & a_2 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\cdots & a_n\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNote that the Jacobian matrix is constant and does not depend on the action variables $I$.\n\nNow, we compute the determinant of this Jacobian matrix. The determinant of a diagonal matrix is the product of its diagonal elements.\n$$\n\\det\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial I}(I)\\right) = \\det\\begin{pmatrix}\na_1 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n0 & a_2 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\cdots & a_n\n\\end{pmatrix} = a_1 \\cdot a_2 \\cdot \\dots \\cdot a_n = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}\n$$\nThis gives the required analytic expression for the determinant.\n\nFinally, we use this result to state the Kolmogorov nondegeneracy condition for the Hamiltonian $H_0(I)$. The KAM theorem requires that the unperturbed frequency map $\\omega(I)$ be a local diffeomorphism, which means its Jacobian matrix must be invertible. A matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is non-zero. This is the Kolmogorov nondegeneracy condition:\n$$\n\\det\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial I}(I)\\right) \\neq 0\n$$\nApplying this to our result, the condition becomes:\n$$\n\\prod_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \\neq 0\n$$\nThis product is non-zero if and only if none of the individual factors are zero. Therefore, the Kolmogorov nondegeneracy condition for the given Hamiltonian $H_0(I)$ is that all coefficients $a_i$ must be non-zero:\n$$\na_i \\neq 0 \\quad \\text{for all } i = 1, \\dots, n.\n$$\nIf this condition holds, the frequencies vary with the actions, and the system is non-degenerate. If any $a_k = 0$, then the frequency $\\omega_k = a_k I_k = 0$ is independent of the action $I_k$, leading to a degeneracy that violates the hypothesis of the KAM theorem.\n\nThe problem asks for the frequency map and the determinant as a single composite expression. The frequency map is $\\omega(I) = (a_{1}I_{1}, \\dots, a_{n}I_{n})$ and the determinant is $\\prod_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}$.",

The setup is complete and consistent. Therefore, a full solution can be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for two things: first, to explain the equivalence between the one-dimensional Diophantine condition with exponent $\\tau=1$ and the boundedness of the partial quotients of $\\omega$; second, to derive explicit constants $\\gamma$ and $\\tau$ for this condition assuming the partial quotients are bounded by an integer $A$.\n\n### Part 1: Characterization of the Diophantine Condition with $\\tau=1$\n\nAn irrational number $\\omega$ is said to satisfy a Diophantine condition with exponent $\\tau=1$ if there exists a constant $\\gamma > 0$ such that for all integers $p$ and positive integers $q$, the inequality $|q\\omega - p| \\ge \\gamma q^{-1}$ holds. We demonstrate that this condition is equivalent to the partial quotients $a_n$ in the continued fraction of $\\omega = [0; a_1, a_2, \\dots]$ being bounded.\n\n**($\\Rightarrow$) Bounded partial quotients imply the Diophantine condition with $\\tau=1$.**\n\nLet us assume there exists an integer $A \\ge 1$ such that $a_n \\le A$ for all $n$. We need to show there is a $\\gamma > 0$ such that $|q\\omega - p| \\ge \\gamma/q$ for all $p \\in \\mathbb{Z}, q \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nThe quality of a rational approximation $p/q$ to $\\omega$ is measured by $|\\omega - p/q|$. A fundamental result from the theory of continued fractions (Legendre's criterion on best rational approximations) states that if a rational number $p/q$ satisfies $|\\omega - p/q|  \\frac{1}{2q^2}$, then $p/q$ must be one of the convergents $p_n/q_n$ of $\\omega$.\n\nThis allows us to partition the problem into two cases for any given pair $(p,q)$.\n\n1.  **$p/q$ is not a convergent of $\\omega$.** In this case, Legendre's criterion implies that $|\\omega - p/q| \\ge \\frac{1}{2q^2}$. Multiplying by $q$ gives $|q\\omega - p| \\ge \\frac{1}{2q}$. This satisfies the Diophantine condition with $\\gamma_1=1/2$ and $\\tau=1$.\n\n2.  **$p/q$ is a convergent, $p_n/q_n$.** For convergents, we have the exact formula for the approximation error:\n    $$\n    |\\omega - \\frac{p_n}{q_n}| = \\frac{1}{q_n (\\alpha_{n+1} q_n + q_{n-1})}\n    $$\n    where $\\alpha_{n+1} = [a_{n+1}; a_{n+2}, \\dots]$ is the $(n+1)$-th complete quotient. Since $a_k \\ge 1$ for all $k$, we have $\\alpha_{n+1} = a_{n+1} + 1/\\alpha_{n+2}  a_{n+1}+1$. Also, from the recurrence $q_k = a_k q_{k-1} + q_{k-2}$, we know $q_n/q_{n-1} > 1$, hence $q_{n-1}/q_n  1$.\n    The term in the denominator can be bounded:\n    $$\n    \\alpha_{n+1} q_n + q_{n-1} = (\\alpha_{n+1} + \\frac{q_{n-1}}{q_n}) q_n  ((a_{n+1}+1) + 1) q_n = (a_{n+1}+2) q_n\n    $$\n    Since the partial quotients are bounded by $A$, i.e., $a_{n+1} \\le A$, we get:\n    $$\n    \\alpha_{n+1} q_n + q_{n-1}  (A+2) q_n\n    $$\n    Substituting this into the error formula gives a lower bound on the approximation error for convergents:\n    $$\n    |\\omega - \\frac{p_n}{q_n}|  \\frac{1}{q_n ((A+2)q_n)} = \\frac{1}{(A+2)q_n^2}\n    $$\n    Multiplying by $q_n$ yields $|q_n\\omega - p_n|  \\frac{1}{(A+2)q_n}$. This satisfies the Diophantine condition with $\\gamma_2=1/(A+2)$ and $\\tau=1$.\n\nCombining both cases, the inequality $|q\\omega - p| \\ge \\gamma/q$ holds for all $p,q$ if we choose $\\gamma = \\min(\\gamma_1, \\gamma_2) = \\min(1/2, 1/(A+2))$. Since $A \\ge 1$, $A+2 \\ge 3$, so $1/(A+2) \\le 1/3  1/2$. Thus, we can take $\\gamma = 1/(A+2)$, and the condition holds with $\\tau=1$.\n\n**($\\Leftarrow$) The Diophantine condition with $\\tau=1$ implies bounded partial quotients.**\n\nAssume $\\omega$ satisfies $|q\\omega - p| \\ge \\gamma/q$ for some $\\gamma  0$ and all $p \\in \\mathbb{Z}, q \\in \\mathbb{N}$. We want to show that the partial quotients $a_n$ are bounded.\nConsider the $n$-th convergent $p_n/q_n$. For this specific pair, the condition states:\n$$\n|q_n\\omega - p_n| \\ge \\frac{\\gamma}{q_n}\n$$\nFrom the theory of continued fractions, we also have a sharp upper bound on the error of convergents:\n$$\n|\\omega - \\frac{p_n}{q_n}|  \\frac{1}{q_n q_{n+1}}\n$$\nwhere $q_{n+1}$ is the denominator of the next convergent. Multiplying by $q_n$ gives:\n$$\n|q_n\\omega - p_n|  \\frac{1}{q_{n+1}}\n$$\nCombining the two inequalities, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{\\gamma}{q_n} \\le |q_n\\omega - p_n|  \\frac{1}{q_{n+1}} \\implies q_{n+1}  \\frac{q_n}{\\gamma}\n$$\nNow, we use the recurrence relation for the denominators of the convergents: $q_{n+1} = a_{n+1}q_n + q_{n-1}$. Since $q_{n-1} > 0$ for $n \\ge 1$, we have $q_{n+1} > a_{n+1}q_n$.\nCombining this with the previous result:\n$$\na_{n+1}q_n  q_{n+1}  \\frac{q_n}{\\gamma} \\implies a_{n+1}q_n  \\frac{q_n}{\\gamma}\n$$\nDividing by $q_n$ (which is positive) yields:\n$$\na_{n+1}  \\frac{1}{\\gamma}\n$$\nSince this holds for all $n \\ge 1$, the sequence of partial quotients $\\{a_n\\}$ is bounded by the constant $1/\\gamma$. This completes the demonstration of the equivalence.\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of Explicit Constants $\\gamma$ and $\\tau$\n\nWe are given that $a_n \\le A$ for some fixed integer $A \\ge 1$ and for all $n$. We need to derive explicit constants $\\gamma$ and $\\tau$ such that $|q \\omega - p| \\ge \\gamma q^{-\\tau}$ for all $p \\in \\mathbb{Z}, q \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nOur derivation mirrors the first part of the argument above, but we will make it fully explicit and self-contained, based on foundational properties of continued fractions. The exponent $\\tau$ will naturally emerge from the analysis.\n\nLet $p \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $q \\in \\mathbb{N}$ be an arbitrary pair of integers. We seek a lower bound on $|q\\omega - p|$. We distinguish two cases.\n\n**Case 1: The rational number $p/q$ is a convergent of $\\omega$.**\nLet $p/q = p_n/q_n$ for some $n \\ge 0$. The error of a convergent is given by\n$$\n|q_n\\omega - p_n| = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_{n+1}q_n + q_{n-1}}\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha_{n+1} = [a_{n+1}; a_{n+2}, \\dots]$ is the $(n+1)$-th complete quotient.\nWe need an upper bound on the denominator $\\alpha_{n+1}q_n + q_{n-1}$.\nThe complete quotient $\\alpha_{n+1}$ can be written as $\\alpha_{n+1} = a_{n+1} + \\frac{1}{\\alpha_{n+2}}$. Since $a_k \\ge 1$ for all $k$, we have $\\alpha_{k} = [a_k; a_{k+1}, \\dots] \\ge 1$. Consequently, $0  1/\\alpha_{n+2} \\le 1$. This implies $a_{n+1}  \\alpha_{n+1} \\le a_{n+1}+1$.\nUsing the assumption $a_{n+1} \\le A$, we get $\\alpha_{n+1} \\le A+1$.\nAlso, the denominators of the convergents satisfy $q_k \\ge 1$ for all $k \\ge 1$, and they form a strictly increasing sequence. Thus, $q_{n-1}  q_n$ for $n \\ge 2$. For $n=1$, $q_0=1, q_1=a_1$, so $q_0 \\le q_1$. The inequality $q_{n-1} \\le q_n$ holds for all $n \\ge 1$.\nWe can now bound the denominator:\n$$\n\\alpha_{n+1}q_n + q_{n-1} \\le (A+1)q_n + q_{n-1} \\le (A+1)q_n + q_n = (A+2)q_n\n$$\nTherefore, for convergents, we have the lower bound:\n$$\n|q_n\\omega - p_n| = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_{n+1}q_n + q_{n-1}} \\ge \\frac{1}{(A+2)q_n}\n$$\nThe inequality is strict because $\\alpha_{n+1}  A+1$ unless all subsequent $a_k=1$ and $\\omega$ is quadratic, and $q_{n-1}q_n$ for $n\\ge 2$. For our purposes, the non-strict inequality is sufficient. This shows that for any convergent $p_n/q_n$, the Diophantine inequality holds with $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{A+2}$ and $\\tau=1$.\n\n**Case 2: The rational number $p/q$ is not a convergent of $\\omega$.**\nWe invoke Legendre's criterion, a fundamental theorem in the theory of continued fractions, which states that if $p, q$ are integers with $q \\ge 1$ and\n$$\n|\\omega - \\frac{p}{q}|  \\frac{1}{2q^2}\n$$\nthen $p/q$ must be a convergent of $\\omega$.\nBy contraposition, if $p/q$ is *not* a convergent of $\\omega$, it must satisfy\n$$\n|\\omega - \\frac{p}{q}| \\ge \\frac{1}{2q^2}\n$$\nMultiplying by $q$ (and noting that this inequality holds for any integer $p$ associated with $q$, as long as $p/q$ is not a convergent), we get:\n$$\n|q\\omega - p| \\ge \\frac{1}{2q}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that for any approximation $p/q$ that is not a convergent, the Diophantine inequality is satisfied with $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\tau=1$. (If $p, q$ are not coprime, let $p=dp', q=dq'$. Then $|q\\omega-p| = d|q'\\omega-p'|$. If $p'/q'$ is not a convergent, $|q'\\omega-p'| \\ge 1/(2q')$, so $|q\\omega-p| \\ge d/(2q')=d^2/(2q) \\ge 1/(2q)$. If $p'/q'$ is a convergent $p_n/q_n$, then $|q\\omega-p| = d|q_n\\omega-p_n| \\ge d/((A+2)q_n) = d^2/((A+2)q) \\ge 1/((A+2)q)$. The argument holds).\n\n**Synthesis of Both Cases:**\nWe have shown that for any $q \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and any $p \\in \\mathbb{Z}$:\n- If $p/q$ is a convergent, $|q\\omega - p| \\ge \\frac{1}{(A+2)q}$.\n- If $p/q$ is not a convergent, $|q\\omega - p| \\ge \\frac{1}{2q}$.\n\nTo ensure the inequality $|q\\omega - p| \\ge \\gamma q^{-\\tau}$ holds for all pairs $(p,q)$, we must choose $\\tau$ and $\\gamma$ that satisfy both conditions. We see that an exponent of $\\tau=1$ works for both cases. We must then choose a value of $\\gamma$ that is a valid lower bound for both scenarios. This is achieved by taking the minimum of the two derived constants:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\min\\left(\\frac{1}{A+2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n$$\nSince we are given that $A \\ge 1$, it follows that $A+2 \\ge 3$. Therefore, $\\frac{1}{A+2} \\le \\frac{1}{3}$. This implies that $\\frac{1}{A+2}  \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe minimum is thus:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{A+2}\n$$\nIn conclusion, for an irrational number $\\omega$ whose continued fraction partial quotients $a_n$ are bounded by $A$, the Diophantine condition $|q \\omega - p| \\ge \\gamma q^{-\\tau}$ is satisfied with the explicit constants $\\tau=1$ and $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{A+2}$.\n\nThe final pair of derived constants is $(\\gamma, \\tau)$.",

It is given that there exist constants $\\gamma  0$ and $\\tau \\geq 0$ such that for all $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{d} \\setminus \\{0\\}$, the following inequality holds:\n$$\n|k \\cdot \\omega| \\geq \\gamma |k|^{-\\tau}\n$$\nSince both sides are positive, we can square the inequality:\n$$\n|k \\cdot \\omega|^{2} \\geq \\gamma^{2} |k|^{-2\\tau}\n$$\nTaking the reciprocal of this expression reverses the inequality sign:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{|k \\cdot \\omega|^{2}} \\leq \\frac{1}{\\gamma^{2} |k|^{-2\\tau}} = \\frac{|k|^{2\\tau}}{\\gamma^{2}}\n$$\nWe substitute this upper bound into our expression for $\\|u\\|_{H^{s}}^{2}$:\n$$\n\\|u\\|_{H^{s}}^{2} \\leq \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{d} \\setminus \\{0\\}} |k|^{2s} \\left( \\frac{|k|^{2\\tau}}{\\gamma^{2}} \\right) |\\hat{f}_{k}|^{2}\n$$\nFactoring out the constant $1/\\gamma^{2}$ and combining the powers of $|k|$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\|u\\|_{H^{s}}^{2} \\leq \\frac{1}{\\gamma^{2}} \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{d} \\setminus \\{0\\}} |k|^{2s + 2\\tau} |\\hat{f}_{k}|^{2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^{2}} \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{d} \\setminus \\{0\\}} |k|^{2(s+\\tau)} |\\hat{f}_{k}|^{2}\n$$\nWe recognize the summation on the right-hand side as the squared Sobolev norm of order $s+\\tau$ for the function $f$. The definition is $\\|f\\|_{H^{s+\\tau}}^{2} = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{d}} |k|^{2(s+\\tau)} |\\hat{f}_{k}|^{2}$. Since $f$ has a zero average, $\\hat{f}_{0} = 0$, so the $k=0$ term vanishes. Thus, the sum can be restricted to $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{d} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. This gives us the relation:\n$$\n\\|u\\|_{H^{s}}^{2} \\leq \\frac{1}{\\gamma^{2}} \\|f\\|_{H^{s+\\tau}}^{2}\n$$\nTaking the square root of both sides, noting that norms are non-negative, yields the desired inequality:\n$$\n\\|u\\|_{H^{s}} \\leq \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\|f\\|_{H^{s+\\tau}}\n$$\nThis establishes that the bound holds with the constant $B = 1/\\gamma$.\n\nTo confirm that this is the smallest possible constant $B$ that can be guaranteed solely from the given information, we consider the ratio of the norms. The constant $B$ must satisfy $B^{2} \\geq \\frac{\\|u\\|_{H^{s}}^{2}}{\\|f\\|_{H^{s+\\tau}}^{2}}$ for any valid function $f$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\|u\\|_{H^{s}}^{2}}{\\|f\\|_{H^{s+\\tau}}^{2}} = \\frac{\\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{d} \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\frac{|k|^{2s}}{|k \\cdot \\omega|^{2}} |\\hat{f}_{k}|^{2}}{\\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{d} \\setminus \\{0\\}} |k|^{2(s+\\tau)} |\\hat{f}_{k}|^{2}} = \\frac{\\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{d} \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\frac{1}{|k \\cdot \\omega|^{2} |k|^{2\\tau}} |k|^{2(s+\\tau)} |\\hat{f}_{k}|^{2}}{\\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{d} \\setminus \\{0\\}} |k|^{2(s+\\tau)} |\\hat{f}_{k}|^{2}}\n$$\nThis ratio is a weighted average of the terms $\\frac{1}{|k \\cdot \\omega|^{2} |k|^{2\\tau}}$. The supremum of such a ratio over all possible functions $f$ (i.e., all choices of Fourier coefficients $\\hat{f}_k$) is the supremum of the weighting factors themselves. Therefore, the best possible constant $B^2$ must be at least this supremum:\n$$\nB^{2} = \\sup_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{d} \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\frac{1}{|k \\cdot \\omega|^{2} |k|^{2\\tau}}\n$$\nFrom the Diophantine condition, we know that $|k \\cdot \\omega| |k|^{\\tau} \\geq \\gamma$, which implies $\\frac{1}{|k \\cdot \\omega| |k|^{\\tau}} \\leq \\frac{1}{\\gamma}$. Squaring gives $\\frac{1}{|k \\cdot \\omega|^{2} |k|^{2\\tau}} \\leq \\frac{1}{\\gamma^{2}}$.\nThe problem is to find a bound for any $\\omega$ satisfying the condition. The condition does not preclude the existence of a sequence of vectors $k_j$ for which $|k_j \\cdot \\omega|$ approaches the lower bound $\\gamma |k_j|^{-\\tau}$. To guarantee the inequality holds for all such $\\omega$, we must accommodate this worst-case scenario. In this case, the supremum of the terms is exactly $1/\\gamma^{2}$.\nTherefore, the smallest constant $B^{2}$ is $1/\\gamma^{2}$, which implies that the smallest constant $B$ is $1/\\gamma$. The exponent $\\tau$ dictates the \"loss of derivatives\" from $f$ to $u$, establishing the relationship between the two Sobolev spaces, but it does not appear in the final multiplicative constant.",
