            "solution": "The problem asks for two main things: first, to explicitly solve the Hamiltonian Floer equation for the given quadratic Hamiltonian, and second, to determine the energy of any finite-energy connecting trajectory between two $1$-periodic orbits.\n\nLet the symplectic manifold be $(M, \\omega_0) = (\\mathbb{R}^{2n}, \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathrm{d}x_i \\wedge \\mathrm{d}y_i)$. The standard almost complex structure is given by the matrix $J = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -I_n \\\\ I_n & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, where $I_n$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix. The Hamiltonian is $H(z) = \\frac{1}{2} z^\\top A z$, where $z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ and $A$ is a symmetric positive definite matrix.

We can express $u(s,t)$ as a Fourier series:\n$$\nu(s,t) = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} u_k(s) e^{i 2\\pi k t},\n$$\nwhere $u_k(s) \\in \\mathbb{C}^{2n}$ are the Fourier coefficients. The derivatives are $\\partial_s u = \\sum_k \\frac{du_k}{ds} e^{i 2\\pi k t}$ and $\\partial_t u = \\sum_k (i 2\\pi k u_k) e^{i 2\\pi k t}$. Substituting these into the Floer equation gives:\n$$\n\\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\left( \\frac{du_k}{ds}(s) + J(i 2\\pi k u_k(s)) + A u_k(s) \\right) e^{i 2\\pi k t} = 0.\n$$\nBy the uniqueness of Fourier coefficients, this must hold for each mode $k$:\n$$\n\\frac{du_k}{ds}(s) + (A + i 2\\pi k J)u_k(s) = 0.\n$$\nThis is a system of linear ordinary differential equations for the coefficients $u_k(s)$. Let us define the matrix $B_k = A + i 2\\pi k J$. The equation for the $k$-th mode is $\\frac{du_k}{ds} = -B_k u_k$.\n\nThe solution is given by the matrix exponential:\n$$\nu_k(s) = \\exp(-s B_k) u_k(0).\n$$\nThe full solution for $u(s,t)$ is then\n$$\nu(s,t) = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\exp(-s(A + i 2\\pi k J)) u_k(0) e^{i 2\\pi k t}.\n$$\nThe properties of this solution depend critically on the spectral properties of the matrices $B_k$. The matrix $A$ is real and symmetric, so it is Hermitian. The matrix $iJ$ is also Hermitian. The matrix $B_k = A + (2\\pi k)(iJ)$ is a real linear combination of Hermitian matrices, and is thus itself a Hermitian matrix for every $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. A fundamental property of Hermitian matrices is that all their eigenvalues are real.\n\nThe solution $u(s,t)$ must satisfy the asymptotic conditions, meaning that for each $k$, the limits $\\lim_{s\\to-\\infty} u_k(s) = x_{-,k}$ and $\\lim_{s\\to+\\infty} u_k(s) = x_{+,k}$ must exist.\nLet $u_k(0)$ be decomposed in the eigenbasis of $B_k$.\n- If an eigenvalue of $B_k$ is positive, the corresponding component of $u_k(s)$ decays to $0$ as $s \\to +\\infty$ and blows up as $s \\to -\\infty$.\n- If an eigenvalue of $B_k$ is negative, the corresponding component decays to $0$ as $s \\to -\\infty$ and blows up as $s \\to +\\infty$.\n- If an eigenvalue of $B_k$ is zero, the corresponding component is constant in $s$.\n\nFor the limit $\\lim_{s\\to+\\infty} u_k(s) = x_{+,k}$ to exist, $u_k(0)$ must have no components corresponding to negative eigenvalues of $B_k$. Similarly, for $\\lim_{s\\to-\\infty} u_k(s) = x_{-,k}$ to exist, $u_k(0)$ must have no components corresponding to positive eigenvalues of $B_k$. For both limits to exist for a non-zero $u_k(s)$, $u_k(0)$ must lie in the kernel of $B_k$.\nHowever, the matrix $A$ is positive definite. For any non-zero vector $v$, $\\langle Av, v \\rangle > 0$. The inner product $\\langle B_k v, v \\rangle = \\langle Av, v \\rangle + 2\\pi k \\langle iJv, v \\rangle$. Since $\\langle Av, v \\rangle$ is real and positive and $\\langle iJv, v \\rangle$ is real, $B_k v=0$ implies $\\langle Av, v \\rangle = 0$, which forces $v=0$. Thus, $B_k$ is invertible for all $k$, and its kernel is trivial.\nThis means that for a finite-energy trajectory to exist, all Fourier modes $u_k(s)$ must be identically zero for $k \\ne 0$. For $k=0$, the equation is $\\frac{du_0}{ds} + A u_0 = 0$. Since $A$ is positive definite, all its eigenvalues are positive, so $u_0(s) \\to 0$ as $s \\to \\infty$ and can only have a limit at $s \\to -\\infty$ if $u_0(s)$ is identically zero.\nThis implies that the only possible connecting trajectory is $u(s,t) \\equiv 0$. The asymptotic limits must therefore be the zero orbit, $x_- = x_+ = 0$. In general, if one relaxes the positive-definite condition on $A$, any finite energy solution must be constant in $s$, i.e., $u(s,t)=x(t)$, connecting an orbit $x$ to itself ($x_- = x_+$).\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the Energy**\n\nThe energy of the trajectory $u$ is defined as\n$$\nE(u) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\int_{0}^{1}\\big\\|\\partial_{s}u(s,t)\\big\\|_{g}^{2}\\,dt\\,ds.\n$$\nAs we have just demonstrated, any finite-energy solution must be of the form $u(s,t) = x(t)$, where $x(t)$ is a $1$-periodic orbit of $X_H$. For such a solution, the partial derivative with respect to $s$ is identically zero: $\\partial_s u(s,t) = 0$.\nSubstituting this into the energy integral gives\n$$\nE(u) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\int_{0}^{1}\\big\\|0\\big\\|_{g}^{2}\\,dt\\,ds = 0.\n$$\n\nAlternatively, we can use the foundational identity relating the energy to the Hamiltonian action functional $\\mathcal{A}_H(x) = \\int_0^1 \\lambda(\\dot{x}(t)) dt - \\int_0^1 H(x(t)) dt$. This identity states that for a trajectory $u$ connecting orbit $x_-$ to $x_+$,\n$$\nE(u) = \\mathcal{A}_H(x_-) - \\mathcal{A}_H(x_+).\n$$\nFrom our analysis of the Floer equation for this specific quadratic Hamiltonian, we proved that a finite-energy connecting trajectory can only exist if $x_- = x_+$.\nTherefore, for any such trajectory,\n$$\nE(u) = \\mathcal{A}_H(x_-) - \\mathcal{A}_H(x_-) = 0.\n$$\nBoth methods lead to the same conclusion. The structure of the problem, specifically with a quadratic Hamiltonian on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, forces the Floer differential to be trivial, meaning the only connections are from an orbit to itself, and these connections have zero energy.\n\nThus, the exact value of the energy $E(u)$ of any finite-energy connecting trajectory is $0$.",

The solution will be derived from foundational principles as stipulated.\n\nA central theorem in Hamiltonian Floer theory is the invariance of Floer homology. For a closed, symplectically aspherical manifold such as $(\\mathbb{T}^{2n}, \\omega_0)$, the Hamiltonian Floer homology $HF_*(H, J; \\mathbb{F})$ is an invariant of the symplectic manifold itself, independent of the particular choice of generic Hamiltonian $H$ and generic compatible almost complex structure $J$. This invariance is established through continuation maps, which are chain isomorphisms induced by generic homotopies between pairs of Hamiltonians. Consequently, to compute $HF_*(H, J; \\mathbb{F})$ for the given generic Hamiltonian $H$, we are at liberty to replace it with any other generic Hamiltonian that is more amenable to calculation.\n\nWe choose a particularly simple Hamiltonian: a time-independent (autonomous) function $h \\colon \\mathbb{T}^{2n} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ which is a Morse function and is $C^2$-small. Let us denote the Floer homology for this autonomous system as $HF_*(h)$. The invariance property ensures that there is a graded isomorphism\n$$\nHF_k(H, J; \\mathbb{F}) \\cong HF_k(h; \\mathbb{F}) \\quad \\forall k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\nand thus their Poincaré polynomials are identical.\n\nWe now analyze $HF_*(h)$. The Floer chain complex, $CF_*(h)$, is the free $\\mathbb{F}$-vector space generated by the $1$-periodic orbits of the Hamiltonian vector field $X_h$. For an autonomous Hamiltonian $h(x)$, the vector field is given by $X_h(x) = J_0 \\nabla h(x)$, where $J_0$ is the standard complex structure on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. The $1$-periodic orbits are solutions to $\\dot{x}(t) = X_h(x(t))$ with $x(1) = x(0)$. The constant maps $x(t) = p$ are solutions if and only if $X_h(p) = 0$, which is equivalent to $\\nabla h(p) = 0$ since $J_0$ is an isomorphism. Thus, the generators of the Floer complex $CF_*(h)$ are precisely the critical points of the Morse function $h$.\n\nThe Floer differential, $\\partial_F \\colon CF_k(h) \\to CF_{k-1}(h)$, is defined by counting rigid pseudo-holomorphic strips. A strip is a map $u \\colon \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{S}^1 \\to \\mathbb{T}^{2n}$ satisfying the Floer equation\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial s} + J(t,u)\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} - X_h(u)\\right) = 0\n$$\nwith limits $\\lim_{s \\to +\\infty} u(s,t) = x_-(t)$ and $\\lim_{s \\to -\\infty} u(s,t) = x_+(t)$, where $x_+$ and $x_-$ are critical points of $h$. For an autonomous Hamiltonian $h$ and a time-independent compatible almost complex structure $J$, the analysis of these strips simplifies considerably. In particular, for a $C^2$-small $h$ and a generic choice of $J$ (including, for example, the standard structure $J_0$), the finite-energy solutions to the Floer equation which contribute to the differential correspond to maps $u(s)$ that are independent of the time variable $t$. With $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}=0$, the Floer equation reduces to\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}s} + J(u) \\left(-X_h(u)\\right) = 0\n$$\nIf we take $J = J_0$, this becomes $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}s} - J_0 (J_0 \\nabla h(u)) = 0$, which simplifies to\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}s} + \\nabla h(u) = 0\n$$\nThis is the equation for the negative gradient flow of the function $h$. The Floer differential, counting rigid pseudo-holomorphic strips between critical points $p_+$ and $p_-$, becomes equivalent to the Morse differential, which counts rigid gradient flow lines of $-h$ (or, by convention, of $h$) between the same critical points. This correspondence establishes a chain isomorphism between the Floer complex, $(CF_*(h), \\partial_F)$, and the Morse complex, $(CM_*(h), \\partial_M)$.\n\nThe problem provides a crucial grading convention: for a $C^2$-small autonomous Morse function $h$, the Conley-Zehnder index $\\mu_{CZ}$ of a constant orbit at a critical point is equal to the Morse index $\\mu_{Morse}$ of that point. The Floer complex is graded by $\\mu_{CZ}$, while the Morse complex is graded by $\\mu_{Morse}$. This specific convention ensures that the chain isomorphism between the complexes is a graded isomorphism.\nTherefore, we have an isomorphism of the homology groups in each degree:\n$$\nHF_k(h; \\mathbb{F}) \\cong HM_k(h; \\mathbb{F})\n$$\nwhere $HM_k(h; \\mathbb{F})$ is the Morse homology of the function $h$.\n\nA fundamental theorem of Morse theory states that the Morse homology of a function on a compact manifold is isomorphic to the singular homology of the manifold with coefficients in the same field:\n$$\nHM_k(h; \\mathbb{F}) \\cong H_k(\\mathbb{T}^{2n}; \\mathbb{F})\n$$\n\nCombining the isomorphisms, we establish a chain of isomorphisms for the homology groups of the original Hamiltonian $H$:\n$$\nHF_k(H, J; \\mathbb{F}) \\cong HF_k(h; \\mathbb{F}) \\cong HM_k(h; \\mathbb{F}) \\cong H_k(\\mathbb{T}^{2n}; \\mathbb{F})\n$$\nThis implies that the Floer-Poincaré polynomial must be equal to the standard Poincaré polynomial of the torus $\\mathbb{T}^{2n}$.\n$$\nP_{HF}(t) = \\sum_{k\\in\\mathbb{Z}} \\dim_{\\mathbb{F}}(HF_{k}(H,J;\\mathbb{F}))\\,t^{k} = \\sum_{k\\in\\mathbb{Z}} \\dim_{\\mathbb{F}}(H_k(\\mathbb{T}^{2n};\\mathbb{F}))\\,t^{k} = P_{H_*(\\mathbb{T}^{2n})}(t)\n$$\n\nThe final step is to compute the Poincaré polynomial of the $2n$-torus. The torus $\\mathbb{T}^{2n}$ is the product of $2n$ copies of the circle, $\\mathbb{S}^1$. The homology of the circle over a field $\\mathbb{F}$ is $H_0(\\mathbb{S}^1; \\mathbb{F}) \\cong \\mathbb{F}$ and $H_1(\\mathbb{S}^1; \\mathbb{F}) \\cong \\mathbb{F}$, with all other homology groups being trivial. Thus, the Poincaré polynomial of the circle is $P_{\\mathbb{S}^1}(t) = \\dim (H_0) t^0 + \\dim(H_1) t^1 = 1+t$.\n\nAccording to the Künneth theorem for homology, the Poincaré polynomial of a product space is the product of the Poincaré polynomials of its factors. Therefore, for $\\mathbb{T}^{2n} = (\\mathbb{S}^1)^{2n}$:\n$$\nP_{H_*(\\mathbb{T}^{2n})}(t) = \\left(P_{\\mathbb{S}^1}(t)\\right)^{2n} = (1+t)^{2n}\n$$\nThis expression is the Poincaré polynomial for the Floer homology. It is an ordinary polynomial in $t$, consistent with the grading convention which maps to non-negative Morse indices ranging from $0$ to $2n$.\n\nThe binomial expansion of this polynomial is given by $\\sum_{k=0}^{2n} \\binom{2n}{k} t^k$, which explicitly shows the dimensions of the graded homology groups: $\\dim_{\\mathbb{F}} HF_k(\\mathbb{T}^{2n}) = \\binom{2n}{k}$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 2n\\}$ and $0$ otherwise. The required closed-form expression is $(1+t)^{2n}$.",
