The dimension of $S$ is equal to the dimension of its domain, which is $\\dim(\\mathbb{R}^{3}) = 3$.\n    For $S$ to be Lagrangian, its dimension must be $4$. Since $\\dim(S)=3$, the condition $\\dim(S) = \\frac{1}{2}\\dim(\\mathbb{R}^{8})$ is not satisfied.\n\nIn conclusion, the explicit expression for the pullback $i^{*}\\omega$ is the zero $2$-form. The submanifold $S$ is isotropic because $i^{*}\\omega=0$, but it is not Lagrangian because its dimension ($3$) is not equal to half the dimension of the ambient space ($4$).",
