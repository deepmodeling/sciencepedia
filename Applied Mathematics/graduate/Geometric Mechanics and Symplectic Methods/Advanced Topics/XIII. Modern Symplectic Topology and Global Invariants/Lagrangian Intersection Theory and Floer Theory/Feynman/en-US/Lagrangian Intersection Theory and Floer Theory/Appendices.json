Before tackling the full Lagrangian Floer complex, it is instructive to ground our understanding in the more familiar setting of Hamiltonian dynamics. This exercise  invites you to compute a spectral invariant, which is a value derived from the action of periodic orbits, for a simple mechanical system on the cotangent bundle of the circle. By working through this fundamental example, you will gain concrete computational experience with the action functional and develop intuition for how it encodes the dynamics of a system.",

Let $\\lambda = p\\,dq$ denote the canonical one-form, so that $\\omega = d\\lambda$. Study the simple mechanical Hamiltonian $H(q,p) = \\tfrac{1}{2}p^{2}$, which generates the Hamiltonian flow via Hamilton's equations. The Hamiltonian Floer action functional for a smooth $1$-periodic orbit $x(t) = (q(t),p(t))$ of the Hamiltonian flow is defined by\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}_{H}(x) = \\int_{0}^{1}\\left(p(t)\\,\\dot{q}(t) - H\\big(q(t),p(t)\\big)\\right)\\,dt,\n$$\nwhich is well-defined on $T^{*}S^{1}$ since $\\omega$ is exact.

Using only the fundamental definitions above and first principles of Hamiltonian dynamics, compute $c_{\\min}(H)$ and explain how it reflects the minimal action among nontrivial $1$-periodic orbits of $H$ on $T^{*}S^{1}$. Express your final answer exactly as a closed-form expression with no rounding and no units.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the computation of the spectral invariant $c_{\\min}(H)$ for the Hamiltonian $H(q,p) = \\frac{1}{2}p^{2}$ on the cotangent bundle $T^{*}S^{1}$. The spectral invariant $c_{\\min}(H)$ is defined as the infimum of the action functional $\\mathcal{A}_{H}(x)$ over all nonconstant $1$-periodic orbits of the Hamiltonian flow.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three steps:\n$1$. Determine the Hamiltonian vector field and solve for the Hamiltonian orbits.\n$2$. Impose the $1$-periodicity condition to find all $1$-periodic orbits and identify the nonconstant ones.\n$3$. Compute the action functional $\\mathcal{A}_{H}(x)$ for these orbits and find the infimum of the resulting values.\n\nStep 1: Hamiltonian Orbits\n\nThe Hamiltonian function is given by $H(q,p) = \\frac{1}{2}p^{2}$ on the phase space $T^{*}S^{1}$ with coordinates $(q,p)$, where $q \\in \\mathbb{R}/2\\pi\\mathbb{Z}$ and $p \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The canonical symplectic form is $\\omega = dq \\wedge dp$. Hamilton's equations of motion for an orbit $x(t) = (q(t), p(t))$ are given by:\n$$\n\\dot{q} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{p} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q}\n$$\nSubstituting the given Hamiltonian $H(q,p) = \\frac{1}{2}p^{2}$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\dot{q} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}p^{2}\\right) = p\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{p} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}p^{2}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThe second equation, $\\dot{p} = 0$, implies that the momentum $p(t)$ is a constant for any given orbit. Let us denote this constant value by $p_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. So, $p(t) = p_0$.\nSubstituting this into the first equation gives $\\dot{q} = p_0$. Integrating this with respect to time $t$ yields:\n$$\nq(t) = p_0 t + q_0\n$$\nwhere $q_0 = q(0)$ is the initial position.\nThus, the Hamiltonian orbits are of the form $x(t) = (p_0 t + q_0, p_0)$ for constants $p_0$ and $q_0$.\n\nStep 2: $1$-Periodic Orbits\n\nAn orbit $x(t)$ is $1$-periodic if $x(1) = x(0)$. This means $(q(1), p(1)) = (q(0), p(0))$.\nThe condition on the momentum coordinate, $p(1) = p(0)$, is automatically satisfied since $p(t) = p_0$ is constant.\nThe condition on the position coordinate, $q(1) = q(0)$, must be interpreted on the circle $S^{1}$. This means $q(1)$ and $q(0)$ represent the same point on the circle, which is equivalent to $q(1) \\equiv q(0) \\pmod{2\\pi}$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\nq(1) = q(0) + 2\\pi k\n$$\nfor some integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The integer $k$ represents the winding number of the orbit's projection on the base manifold $S^1$.\nUsing the solution for $q(t)$, we have $q(1) = p_0(1) + q_0 = p_0 + q_0$. The periodicity condition becomes:\n$$\np_0 + q_0 = q_0 + 2\\pi k\n$$\nThis simplifies to $p_0 = 2\\pi k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSo, the $1$-periodic orbits are those for which the momentum $p_0$ is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$. An orbit is uniquely determined (up to initial position $q_0$) by this integer $k$. We denote these orbits by $x_k(t)$.\n\nThe problem specifies that we must consider only *nonconstant* orbits. An orbit $x(t) = (p_0 t + q_0, p_0)$ is constant if and only if $\\dot{q}(t)=0$ for all $t$. Since $\\dot{q}=p_0$, this implies $p_0 = 0$. This corresponds to the case $k=0$.\nTherefore, the set of nonconstant $1$-periodic orbits corresponds to the integer values $k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n\nStep 3: Action Functional and its Infimum\n\nThe Hamiltonian Floer action functional for a $1$-periodic orbit $x(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}_{H}(x) = \\int_{0}^{1}\\left(p(t)\\,\\dot{q}(t) - H\\big(q(t),p(t)\\big)\\right)\\,dt\n$$\nLet us compute this for a nonconstant periodic orbit $x_k(t)$, where $k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. For such an orbit, we have:\n- $p(t) = p_0 = 2\\pi k$\n- $\\dot{q}(t) = p_0 = 2\\pi k$\n- $H(q(t), p(t)) = \\frac{1}{2}p(t)^{2} = \\frac{1}{2}(2\\pi k)^{2} = \\frac{1}{2}(4\\pi^2 k^2) = 2\\pi^2 k^2$\n\nThe integrand is $p(t)\\dot{q}(t) - H(q(t),p(t))$, which is constant along the orbit:\n$$\np(t)\\dot{q}(t) - H(q(t),p(t)) = (2\\pi k)(2\\pi k) - 2\\pi^2 k^2 = 4\\pi^2 k^2 - 2\\pi^2 k^2 = 2\\pi^2 k^2\n$$\nNow, we can compute the action integral:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}_{H}(x_k) = \\int_{0}^{1} (2\\pi^2 k^2) \\,dt = 2\\pi^2 k^2 \\int_{0}^{1} dt = 2\\pi^2 k^2(1) = 2\\pi^2 k^2\n$$\nThe action of a nonconstant $1$-periodic orbit depends only on the square of its winding number $k$. The set of possible action values is $\\{2\\pi^2 k^2 \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{0\\}\\}$.\n\nThe spectral invariant $c_{\\min}(H)$ is the infimum of this set of values:\n$$\nc_{\\min}(H) = \\inf\\{\\mathcal{A}_{H}(x_k) \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{0\\}\\} = \\inf\\{2\\pi^2 k^2 \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{0\\}\\}\n$$\nTo find the infimum, we need to find the minimum value of $k^2$ for $k \\in \\{\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\dots\\}$. The minimum non-zero value of $|k|$ is $1$, which means the minimum value of $k^2$ is $1^2=1$.\nThis minimum is achieved for $k=1$ and $k=-1$.\nTherefore, the infimum is also the minimum value in the set, which is:\n$$\nc_{\\min}(H) = 2\\pi^2 (1)^2 = 2\\pi^2\n$$\n\nThis value, $c_{\\min}(H) = 2\\pi^2$, represents the minimal action among all non-trivial periodic motions of the system. The Hamiltonian $H=\\frac{1}{2}p^2$ describes a free particle on a circle. The periodic orbits correspond to the particle traveling around the circle an integer number of times ($k$ times) and returning to its starting configuration space point with the same momentum. The orbits with winding number $k=\\pm 1$ are the \"simplest\" or \"fundamental\" non-trivial periodic orbits, and $c_{\\min}(H)$ is precisely their action. This quantity is a fundamental characteristic of the Hamiltonian dynamics on the given symplectic manifold.",

            "solution": "The problem is divided into two parts: a theoretical explanation of the action filtration and its induced spectral sequence, and an explicit computation of the $E_1$ page for a specific example.\n\nFirst, we address the theoretical foundation. Let $(M,\\omega)$ be a symplectic manifold and let $L_0, L_1$ be two exact, transversely intersecting Lagrangian submanifolds. Since $L_i$ are exact, the restriction of the Liouville $1$-form $\\lambda$ to each $L_i$ is exact, i.e., $\\lambda|_{L_i} = df_i$ for some functions $f_i: L_i \\to \\mathbb{R}$. The Lagrangian Floer chain complex, denoted $C_*(L_0, L_1; \\mathbb{Z}_2)$, is the free $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-module generated by the intersection points $L_0 \\cap L_1$. The grading on this complex is given by the Maslov index. The Floer differential $d: C_k \\to C_{k-1}$ is defined by counting pseudo-holomorphic strips whose moduli space has dimension 1 (i.e., rigid up to time-shift). For generators $p, q \\in L_0 \\cap L_1$, the coefficient of $q$ in $d(p)$ is the number (modulo 2) of such strips $u: \\mathbb{R} \\times [0,1] \\to M$ asymptotic to $p$ as $s \\to -\\infty$ and to $q$ as $s \\to +\\infty$.\n\nThe action functional $\\mathcal{A}: L_0 \\cap L_1 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is defined for each intersection point $p$ by $\\mathcal{A}(p) = f_1(p) - f_0(p)$. This definition depends on the choice of primitives $f_0$ and $f_1$, but shifting $f_i$ by a constant $c_i$ shifts the entire action spectrum by a constant $c_1 - c_0$, which does not affect the filtration differences.\n\nA key property connecting the differential and the action is the energy-action identity. The energy of a Floer strip $u$ connecting $p$ to $q$ is $E(u) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}\\times[0,1]} u^*\\omega$. For non-constant strips, $E(u) > 0$. The identity states that $E(u) = \\mathcal{A}(p) - \\mathcal{A}(q)$. This implies that if the differential $d(p)$ has a non-zero $q$ component (meaning there is a strip from $p$ to $q$), then we must have $\\mathcal{A}(p) > \\mathcal{A}(q)$. This means the Floer differential $d$ strictly decreases the action.\n\nThis property allows us to define a filtration on $C_*(L_0, L_1; \\mathbb{Z}_2)$. For any real number $c$, let $F_c C_*(L_0, L_1)$ be the vector subspace spanned by generators $p$ such that $\\mathcal{A}(p) \\leq c$. The condition that $d$ decreases action implies that $d(F_c C_*) \\subseteq F_c C^*$, so $(F_c C_*)_{c\\in\\mathbb{R}}$ is a filtration of the chain complex.\n\nSince $L_0$ and $L_1$ are transverse and compact (or satisfy appropriate compactness conditions as in the case of $T^*S^1$), the set of intersection points $L_0 \\cap L_1$ is finite. Consequently, there is a finite set of action values $\\{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_N\\}$. This means the filtration is bounded: it is trivial below $a_{\\min} = \\min_i(a_i)$ and constant above $a_{\\max} = \\max_i(a_i)$. It is exhaustive because the union over all $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ of $F_c C_*$ is the entire complex $C_*$.\n\nAny bounded, exhaustive filtration on a chain complex gives rise to a spectral sequence. The $E_0$ page of this sequence is the associated graded complex, $(E_0)_{*,*} = \\bigoplus_c (F_c C_* / F_{<c} C_*)$, where $F_{<c} C_* = \\bigcup_{c'<c} F_{c'} C_*$. The differential $d_0$ on $E_0$ is the part of $d$ that preserves the filtration level. The $E_1$ page is the homology of $(E_0, d_0)$. This spectral sequence converges to the homology of the total complex, $H_*(L_0, L_1; \\mathbb{Z}_2)$.\n\nNow, we compute the $E_1$ page for the given example.\nThe symplectic manifold is $(M,\\omega) = (T^*S^1, d\\lambda)$, where $\\lambda = p dq$ is the canonical $1$-form.\nThe first Lagrangian is the zero section, $L_0 = \\{(q,p) \\in T^*S^1 \\mid p=0\\}$. On $L_0$, $\\lambda = 0 \\cdot dq = 0$, so it is exact. We can choose the primitive $f_0: L_0 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ to be the constant function $f_0(q,0) = 0$.\nThe second Lagrangian is $L_1 = \\{(q, df_q) \\mid q \\in S^1\\}$, the graph of the $1$-form $df$. On $L_1$, $\\lambda|_{L_1} = (df_q) dq = df$. This is exact, and we can choose the primitive $f_1: L_1 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ to be $f$ itself, i.e., $f_1(q, df_q) = f(q)$.\n\nThe intersection points $p \\in L_0 \\cap L_1$ are points where $p_q=0$ and $p_q = df_q$. Thus, the intersection points correspond to the points $q \\in S^1$ where $df_q = 0$. These are precisely the critical points of $f$. The problem states there are two such points, $x_{\\min}$ and $x_{\\max}$.\nThe generators of the Floer complex $C_*(L_0, L_1; \\mathbb{Z}_2)$ are $x_{\\min}$ and $x_{\\max}$.\n\nThe Maslov gradings are given as $|x_{\\min}| = 0$ and $|x_{\\max}| = 1$. The Floer chain complex is concentrated in degrees $0$ and $1$:\n$$ C_0(L_0, L_1; \\mathbb{Z}_2) = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\langle x_{\\min} \\rangle $$\n$$ C_1(L_0, L_1; \\mathbb{Z}_2) = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\langle x_{\\max} \\rangle $$\nAll other groups $C_k$ for $k \\ne 0, 1$ are zero.\n\nThe action of the generators is $\\mathcal{A}(x) = f_1(x,0) - f_0(x,0) = f(x) - 0 = f(x)$.\nSo, $\\mathcal{A}(x_{\\min}) = f(x_{\\min}) = a$ and $\\mathcal{A}(x_{\\max}) = f(x_{\\max}) = b$. We are given $a < b$.\n\nThe action filtration defines the spectral sequence. The $E_0$ page is the associated graded complex, decomposed according to action values.

Since there are no two distinct generators with the same action value, the differential $d_0$ must be identically zero.\n\nThe $E_1$ page is the homology of the $E_0$ page with respect to $d_0$.\n$$ (E_1)_{c,k} = H_k((E_0)_{c,*}, d_0) = \\frac{\\ker(d_0: (E_0)_{c,k} \\to (E_0)_{c,k-1})}{\\text{im}(d_0: (E_0)_{c,k+1} \\to (E_0)_{c,k})} $$\nSince $d_0=0$, we have $(E_1)_{c,k} \\cong (E_0)_{c,k}$.\n$$ (E_1)_{a,0} = (E_0)_{a,0} = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\langle x_{\\min} \\rangle $$\n$$ (E_1)_{b,1} = (E_0)_{b,1} = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\langle x_{\\max} \\rangle $$\nAll other $(E_1)_{c,k}$ are trivial.\n\nThe problem asks for the ranks of the groups on the $E_1$ page in degrees $0$ and $1$. These are the ranks of $E_1^0 = \\bigoplus_c (E_1)_{c,0}$ and $E_1^1 = \\bigoplus_c (E_1)_{c,1}$.\nFor degree $0$:\n$E_1^0 = (E_1)_{a,0} \\oplus (E_1)_{b,0} = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\langle x_{\\min} \\rangle \\oplus 0 = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\langle x_{\\min} \\rangle$.\nThe rank of $E_1^0$ is $1$.\n\nFor degree $1$:\n$E_1^1 = (E_1)_{a,1} \\oplus (E_1)_{b,1} = 0 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\langle x_{\\max} \\rangle = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\langle x_{\\max} \\rangle$.\nThe rank of $E_1^1$ is $1$.\n\nThe ranks of the $E_1$ page groups in degrees $0$ and $1$ are $1$ and $1$, respectively.

Identify the Morse Complex and Gradient Trajectories**\n\nThe problem states that the Floer complex is identified with the Morse complex of $f(q)=\\cos(q)$ on $L=S^1$. The generators are the critical points of $f$. The derivative $f'(q) = -\\sin(q)$ is zero for $q \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ at $q=0$ and $q=\\pi$.\n-   **At $q=0$**: $f''(0) = -\\cos(0) = -1$.

This is a minimum, corresponding to the generator $x_-$ with Morse index 0.\n\nThe Morse chain complex over $\\mathbb{C}$ is therefore $C_1 = \\mathbb{C} \\cdot x_+$ and $C_0 = \\mathbb{C} \\cdot x_-$. All other chain groups are zero. The only potentially non-trivial differential is the map $d: C_1 \\to C_0$.\n\nThe Floer differential counts pseudo-holomorphic strips connecting $x_+$ to $x_-$. These strips project to negative gradient trajectories of $f$. The gradient vector field is $\\nabla f = -\\sin(q)\\partial_q$. A negative gradient trajectory $\\gamma(t)$ satisfies $\\dot{\\gamma} = -\\nabla f = \\sin(q)\\partial_q$.\nThere are exactly two such trajectories connecting the critical point at $q=0$ to the one at $q=\\pi$:\n1.  **$\\gamma_1$**: The trajectory along the \"upper\" arc of $S^1$, where $q$ increases from $0$ to $\\pi$.\n2.  **$\\gamma_2$**: The trajectory along the \"lower\" arc of $S^1$, where $q$ decreases from $0$ (or $2\\pi$) to $\\pi$.\nEach strip's contribution to the differential is weighted by the holonomy of the local system $\\mathcal{L}_h$ along the corresponding boundary path on $L$.\n\n**2.

For $h=1$, the holonomies $w_1=w_2=1$. Thus, the differential coefficient is $\\varepsilon_1+\\varepsilon_2$. Setting this to zero implies $\\varepsilon_2 = -\\varepsilon_1$.

We analyze two cases for the scalar factor $(h^{1/2} - h^{-1/2})$:\n-   **Case 1: $h = 1$.** The factor is $1^{1/2} - 1^{-1/2} = 0$. The differential $d$ is the zero map.\n    -   $H_1 = \\ker(0) = C_1 \\cong \\mathbb{C}$.\n    -   $H_0 = \\operatorname{coker}(0) = C_0 \\cong \\mathbb{C}$.\n    -   The total dimension is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}H_{*} = 1+1=2$.\n\n-   **Case 2: $h \\neq 1$.** The factor $(h^{1/2} - h^{-1/2})$ is a non-zero complex number. The differential $d: \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is an isomorphism.\n    -   $H_1 = \\ker(d) = \\{0\\}$.\n    -   $H_0 = \\operatorname{coker}(d) = \\mathbb{C} / \\operatorname{im}(d) = \\mathbb{C} / \\mathbb{C} = \\{0\\}$.\n    -   The total dimension is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}H_{*} = 0+0=0$.\n\nSo, the total dimension of the twisted Floer homology is a function of $h$:\n$$ \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}H_{*}\\left(L,L^{\\prime};\\mathcal{L}_{h}\\right) = \\begin{cases} 2 & \\text{if } h=1 \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } h\\neq 1 \\end{cases} $$\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\nWe are asked to compute the dimension for the local system $\\mathcal{L}_{\\exp(2\\pi i/3)}$. The monodromy is $h = \\exp(2\\pi i/3)$. Since $h \\neq 1$, we are in Case 2.\nTherefore, the total dimension of the homology is 0.",
