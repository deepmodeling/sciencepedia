A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested by the problem statement. First, we derive the necessary identity, and second, we use this identity to simplify the given differential form `\\Phi`.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the identity `dx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\nu} = \\delta^{\\mu}_{\\nu}\\eta`**\n\nThe volume `n`-form on `X` is `\\eta = dx^{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{n}`. The `(n-1)`-forms `\\eta_{\\nu}` are defined by `\\eta_{\\nu} = \\iota_{\\partial/\\partial x^{\\nu}}\\eta`. To find an explicit expression for `\\eta_{\\nu}`, we apply the graded Leibniz rule for the interior product `\\iota_{v}(\\alpha \\wedge \\beta) = (\\iota_{v}\\alpha) \\wedge \\beta + (-1)^{\\deg\\alpha}\\alpha \\wedge \\iota_{v}\\beta` to `\\eta`. Since each `dx^{k}` is a `1`-form, a more general rule for a product of `1`-forms `\\alpha_j` is `\\iota_v(\\alpha_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\alpha_n) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^{k-1} \\alpha_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\iota_v(\\alpha_k) \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\alpha_n`.\n\nApplying this to `\\eta_{\\nu} = \\iota_{\\partial/\\partial x^{\\nu}}(dx^{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{n})`:\n$$\n\\eta_{\\nu} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^{k-1} dx^{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\iota_{\\partial/\\partial x^{\\nu}}(dx^{k}) \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{n}\n$$\nUsing the given identity `\\iota_{\\partial/\\partial x^{\\nu}}(dx^{k}) = \\delta^{k}_{\\nu}`, the sum collapses to a single term where `k=\\nu`:\n$$\n\\eta_{\\nu} = (-1)^{\\nu-1} dx^{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge (\\delta^{\\nu}_{\\nu}) \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{n}\n$$\nHere, `\\delta^{\\nu}_{\\nu} = 1` and the term `dx^{\\nu}` is removed from the wedge product. So, `\\eta_{\\nu}` is the `(n-1)`-form:\n$$\n\\eta_{\\nu} = (-1)^{\\nu-1} dx^{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{\\nu-1} \\wedge dx^{\\nu+1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{n}\n$$\nNow we compute the wedge product `dx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\nu}`. We consider two cases.\n\nCase 1: `\\mu \\neq \\nu`.\nIn this case, the `1`-form `dx^{\\mu}` is already a factor in the expansion of `\\eta_{\\nu}` (since `\\mu` is one of the indices from `1` to `n` but is not `\\nu`). Taking the wedge product of `dx^{\\mu}` with `\\eta_{\\nu}` results in `dx^{\\mu}` appearing twice. Since `dx^{\\mu} \\wedge dx^{\\mu} = 0` for any `1`-form, we have:\n$$\ndx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\nu} = 0 \\quad (\\text{for } \\mu \\neq \\nu)\n$$\nThis matches the right-hand side of the identity, `\\delta^{\\mu}_{\\nu}\\eta = 0 \\cdot \\eta = 0`.\n\nCase 2: `\\mu = \\nu`.\nWe compute `dx^{\\nu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\nu}`:\n$$\ndx^{\\nu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\nu} = dx^{\\nu} \\wedge \\left( (-1)^{\\nu-1} dx^{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{\\nu-1} \\wedge dx^{\\nu+1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{n} \\right)\n$$\nTo reorder the terms to form `\\eta`, we must move `dx^{\\nu}` from the front to its original position between `dx^{\\nu-1}` and `dx^{\\nu+1}`. This requires commuting `dx^{\\nu}` past `\\nu-1` one-forms (`dx^{1}, \\dots, dx^{\\nu-1}`). Each commutation of two `1`-forms introduces a factor of `-1`.\n$$\ndx^{\\nu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\nu} = (-1)^{\\nu-1} (-1)^{\\nu-1} dx^{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{\\nu-1} \\wedge dx^{\\nu} \\wedge dx^{\\nu+1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{n}\n$$\nSince `(-1)^{\\nu-1} (-1)^{\\nu-1} = (-1)^{2(\\nu-1)} = 1`, this simplifies to:\n$$\ndx^{\\nu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\nu} = dx^{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{n} = \\eta \\quad (\\text{for } \\mu = \\nu)\n$$\nThis matches the right-hand side of the identity, `\\delta^{\\nu}_{\\nu}\\eta = 1 \\cdot \\eta = \\eta`.\n\nCombining both cases, we have proven the identity `dx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\nu} = \\delta^{\\mu}_{\\nu}\\eta`.\n\n**Part 2: Simplification of the form `\\Phi`**\n\nThe given form is `\\Phi = \\sum_{\\mu,\\nu=1}^{n} A_{\\mu\\nu}\\,dx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\nu} + \\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\sum_{\\mu=1}^{n} B_{i}^{\\mu}\\,dy^{i} \\wedge dx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\mu}`. We simplify each of the two terms separately.\n\nSimplification of the first term:\nLet the first term be `\\Phi_{1} = \\sum_{\\mu,\\nu=1}^{n} A_{\\mu\\nu}\\,dx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\nu}`. We apply the identity derived above:\n$$\n\\Phi_{1} = \\sum_{\\mu,\\nu=1}^{n} A_{\\mu\\nu} (\\delta^{\\mu}_{\\nu}\\eta)\n$$\nThe Kronecker delta `\\delta^{\\mu}_{\\nu}` is non-zero only when `\\nu = \\mu`. Thus, we can collapse the summation over `\\nu`:\n$$\n\\Phi_{1} = \\sum_{\\mu=1}^{n} A_{\\mu\\mu}\\eta = \\left(\\sum_{\\mu=1}^{n} A_{\\mu\\mu}\\right) \\eta\n$$\nThe sum `\\sum_{\\mu=1}^{n} A_{\\mu\\mu}` is the trace of the matrix `A` whose components are `A_{\\mu\\nu}`.\n\nSimplification of the second term:\nLet the second term be `\\Phi_{2} = \\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\sum_{\\mu=1}^{n} B_{i}^{\\mu}\\,dy^{i} \\wedge dx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\mu}`.\nConsider the wedge product `dy^{i} \\wedge dx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\mu}`. The wedge product is associative, so we can group it as `dy^{i} \\wedge (dx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\mu})`. We apply the identity `dx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\nu} = \\delta^{\\mu}_{\\nu}\\eta` with `\\nu=\\mu`:\n$$\ndx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\mu} = \\delta^{\\mu}_{\\mu}\\eta = 1 \\cdot \\eta = \\eta\n$$\nNote that this identity `dx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\mu} = \\eta` holds for each individual index `\\mu` from `1` to `n`. Substituting this into the expression for `\\Phi_2`:\n$$\ndy^{i} \\wedge dx^{\\mu} \\wedge \\eta_{\\mu} = dy^{i} \\wedge \\eta\n$$\nThe term `dy^{i} \\wedge \\eta` is independent of the summation index `\\mu`. So we can write `\\Phi_{2}` as:\n$$\n\\Phi_{2} = \\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\sum_{\\mu=1}^{n} B_{i}^{\\mu} (dy^{i} \\wedge \\eta)\n$$\nWe can rearrange the summations and factor out the form `dy^{i} \\wedge \\eta`, which is constant with respect to the sum over `\\mu`:\n$$\n\\Phi_{2} = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left( \\sum_{\\mu=1}^{n} B_{i}^{\\mu} \\right) dy^{i} \\wedge \\eta\n$$\n\nCombining the simplified parts `\\Phi_{1}` and `\\Phi_{2}`, we obtain the final expression for `\\Phi`:\n$$\n\\Phi = \\Phi_{1} + \\Phi_{2} = \\left(\\sum_{\\mu=1}^{n} A_{\\mu\\mu}\\right) \\eta + \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left(\\sum_{\\mu=1}^{n} B_{i}^{\\mu}\\right) dy^{i} \\wedge \\eta\n$$\nThis is the simplified closed-form analytic expression for `\\Phi` in terms of `\\eta` and `dy^{i} \\wedge \\eta`, with coefficients constructed from the given constants `A_{\\mu\\nu}` and `B_{i}^{\\mu}`.",

The first term is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v^{A}} \\, dq^{A} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v^{1}} \\, dq^{1} + \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v^{2}} \\, dq^{2} = q^{2} \\, dq^{1} + 0 \\cdot dq^{2} = q^{2} \\, dq^{1}\n$$\nThe second term, within the parentheses, is the Cartan Hamiltonian function $H_{L}$:\n$$\nH_{L} = L - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v^{A}} \\, v^{A} = (q^{2}v^{1}) - \\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v^{1}} v^{1} + \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v^{2}} v^{2}\\right) = q^{2}v^{1} - (q^{2} \\cdot v^{1} + 0 \\cdot v^{2}) = 0\n$$\nSince $H_{L} = 0$, the Poincaré–Cartan form simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Theta_{L} = q^{2} \\, dq^{1}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the presymplectic $2$-form $\\Omega_{L}$ by taking the negative exterior derivative of $\\Theta_{L}$:\n$$\n\\Omega_{L} = - d\\Theta_{L} = - d(q^{2} \\, dq^{1})\n$$\nUsing the product rule for exterior derivatives, $d(f \\omega) = df \\wedge \\omega + f \\, d\\omega$, and noting that $d(dq^{1}) = 0$:\n$$\n\\Omega_{L} = - (d(q^{2}) \\wedge dq^{1} + q^{2} \\, d(dq^{1})) = - (dq^{2} \\wedge dq^{1})\n$$\nUsing the anticommutativity of the wedge product, $dq^{2} \\wedge dq^{1} = - dq^{1} \\wedge dq^{2}$, we get:\n$$\n\\Omega_{L} = dq^{1} \\wedge dq^{2}\n$$\nThe space $J^{1}E$ is a $5$-dimensional manifold with local coordinates $(t, q^{1}, q^{2}, v^{1}, v^{2})$. The form $\\Omega_{L}$ only involves differentials of $q^{1}$ and $q^{2}$.\n\nTo find the kernel of $\\Omega_{L}$, we search for vector fields $V$ on $J^{1}E$ such that their interior product with $\\Omega_{L}$ is zero, i.e., $i_{V}\\Omega_{L} = 0$. Let $V$ be a general vector field:\n$$\nV = V_{t} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + V_{q^{1}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{1}} + V_{q^{2}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q^{2}} + V_{v^{1}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{1}} + V_{v^{2}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{2}}\n$$\nThe interior product is:\n$$\ni_{V}\\Omega_{L} = i_{V}(dq^{1} \\wedge dq^{2}) = (i_{V}dq^{1}) dq^{2} - (i_{V}dq^{2}) dq^{1}\n$$\nThe action of $i_{V}$ on a $1$-form is evaluation of the form on the vector field: $i_{V}dq^{A} = dq^{A}(V) = V_{q^{A}}$.\n$$\ni_{V}\\Omega_{L} = V_{q^{1}} \\, dq^{2} - V_{q^{2}} \\, dq^{1}\n$$\nFor this to be the zero $1$-form, the coefficients of the basis $1$-forms must be zero. Thus, we must have $V_{q^{1}} = 0$ and $V_{q^{2}} = 0$. The coefficients $V_{t}$, $V_{v^{1}}$, and $V_{v^{2}}$ can be arbitrary.\nTherefore, any vector field in the kernel of $\\Omega_{L}$ is a linear combination of the basis vectors $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{1}}$, and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v^{2}}$.\nThe kernel, $\\ker \\Omega_{L}$, is the distribution spanned by these three vector fields. The dimension of the kernel is the number of spanning vectors.\n$$\n\\dim(\\ker \\Omega_{L}) = 3\n$$\n\n### Task 2: Constraint Analysis on $T^{*}Q$\n\nWe perform the fiber derivative (Legendre transform) to define the canonical momenta $p_{A}$ and find the primary constraints. The configuration space is $Q \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, so the phase space is $T^{*}Q$ with coordinates $(q^{1}, q^{2}, p_{1}, p_{2})$.\n$$\np_{1} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v^{1}} = q^{2}\n$$\n$$\np_{2} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial v^{2}} = 0\n$$\nThese equations define relationships among the phase space variables $(q^{A}, p_{A})$ that do not involve the velocities $v^{A}$. These are the primary constraints. We express them as functions that vanish on the constraint submanifold of $T^{*}Q$:\n$$\n\\phi_{1} := p_{1} - q^{2} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\phi_{2} := p_{2} = 0\n$$\nThere are two primary constraints. To classify them as first-class or second-class, we compute the matrix of their Poisson brackets, $C_{ij} = \\{\\phi_{i}, \\phi_{j}\\}$. The canonical Poisson brackets are $\\{q^{A}, p_{B}\\} = \\delta^{A}_{B}$, with all other fundamental brackets being zero.\n\nThe diagonal elements are zero:\n$$\n\\{\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{1}\\} = \\{p_{1} - q^{2}, p_{1} - q^{2}\\} = \\{p_{1},p_{1}\\} - \\{p_{1},q^{2}\\} - \\{q^{2},p_{1}\\} + \\{q^{2},q^{2}\\} = 0 - 0 - 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\{\\phi_{2}, \\phi_{2}\\} = \\{p_{2}, p_{2}\\} = 0\n$$\nThe off-diagonal element is:\n$$\n\\{\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{2}\\} = \\{p_{1} - q^{2}, p_{2}\\} = \\{p_{1}, p_{2}\\} - \\{q^{2}, p_{2}\\}\n$$\nUsing the fundamental brackets, $\\{p_{1}, p_{2}\\} = 0$ and $\\{q^{2}, p_{2}\\} = \\delta^{2}_{2} = 1$.\n$$\n\\{\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{2}\\} = 0 - 1 = -1\n$$\nBy the antisymmetry of the Poisson bracket, $\\{\\phi_{2}, \\phi_{1}\\} = -\\{\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{2}\\} = 1$. The Poisson bracket matrix is:\n$$\nC = \\begin{pmatrix} \\{\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{1}\\} & \\{\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{2}\\} \\\\ \\{\\phi_{2}, \\phi_{1}\\} & \\{\\phi_{2}, \\phi_{2}\\} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nA constraint is first-class if its Poisson bracket with all other constraints vanishes (on the constraint surface). The number of first-class constraints is the dimension of the null space of the matrix $C$. A linear combination $\\Psi = c^{1}\\phi_{1} + c^{2}\\phi_{2}$ is a first-class constraint if $\\{\\Psi, \\phi_{j}\\} = 0$ for $j=1,2$. This is equivalent to finding a vector $(c^{1}, c^{2})$ in the null space of $C$.\n$$\n\\det(C) = (0)(0) - (-1)(1) = 1\n$$\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the matrix $C$ is invertible. Its null space is trivial, containing only the zero vector. Therefore, there are no non-trivial linear combinations of $\\phi_{1}$ and $\\phi_{2}$ that form a first-class constraint. The number of first-class primary constraints is $0$.\n\nConstraints are second-class if their Poisson bracket matrix is non-degenerate. Since the matrix $C$ for the set of constraints $\\{\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{2}\\}$ is non-degenerate, both constraints are second-class. The number of second-class primary constraints is the rank of the matrix $C$, which is $2$.\n\nIn summary:\n- The dimension of $\\ker \\Omega_{L}$ is $3$.\n- The number of first-class primary constraints is $0$.\n- The number of second-class primary constraints is $2$.\n\nThe final answer is a row matrix of these three integers.",
