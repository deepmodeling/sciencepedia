This first practice focuses on deriving one of the most important viscoelastic properties, the stress relaxation modulus $G(t)$, from the linearized dynamics of a slip-spring model. By performing a normal mode analysis, you will see how the relaxation of entanglement segments translates directly into the decay of stress following a deformation, providing a concrete link between the model's parameters and observable rheology.

            "problem": "Consider a single linear polymer chain modeled as a sequence of $N$ beads connected by Gaussian springs in three spatial dimensions. The chain is entangled through $Z$ slip-springs that couple the chain to a phantom network. Each slip-spring is a harmonic constraint of spring constant $k_{s}$ between a chain bead and a fixed anchor in space. Let the bead friction coefficient be $\\zeta$ and the effective contour-sliding friction associated with slip-spring motion be $\\zeta_{s}$. Assume overdamped dynamics so that inertial terms are negligible. The chain is at equilibrium in an unstrained state for $t<0$, and at $t=0$ an infinitesimal, spatially homogeneous step strain is applied, after which the system relaxes at fixed volume and temperature. \n\nDefine the sequence of $Z-1$ entanglement segment vectors by $ \\mathbf{u}_{i}(t) = \\mathbf{R}_{b_{i+1}}(t) - \\mathbf{R}_{b_{i}}(t) $ for $i=1,\\dots,Z-1$, where $\\mathbf{R}_{b_{i}}(t)$ denotes the position of the bead at which the $i$-th slip-spring is attached and the set $\\{b_{i}\\}$ is ordered along the chain. In the small-strain limit, linearize the stochastic dynamics around equilibrium and neglect spatial heterogeneity of the slip-spring spacing so that the $ \\mathbf{u}_{i}(t) $ form a nearest-neighbor coupled set with free-end boundary conditions. Use the overdamped Langevin description, Hookean elasticity for slip-springs, and the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT) to obtain a linear operator governing the relaxation of $ \\mathbf{u}_{i}(t) $ and its normal modes. \n\nLet the effective friction for the entanglement segment dynamics be $ \\zeta_{e} = \\zeta + \\zeta_{s} $ and assume isotropy so that the three Cartesian components of $ \\mathbf{u}_{i}(t) $ are statistically equivalent.

Inertial effects are negligible.\n-   **Friction**: Bead friction coefficient is $\\zeta$; slip-spring contour-sliding friction is $\\zeta_s$. Effective friction for segment dynamics is $\\zeta_e = \\zeta + \\zeta_s$.\n-   **Process**: System is at equilibrium for $t<0$. At $t=0$, an infinitesimal, homogeneous step strain is applied. The system then relaxes.\n-   **Variables**: Entanglement segment vectors are defined as $\\mathbf{u}_{i}(t) = \\mathbf{R}_{b_{i+1}}(t) - \\mathbf{R}_{b_{i}}(t)$ for $i=1, \\dots, Z-1$, where $\\mathbf{R}_{b_{i}}(t)$ is the position of the bead attached to the $i$-th slip-spring.\n-   **Model Specification**: The problem specifies that in the linear, small-strain limit, and neglecting heterogeneity, the dynamics of the segment vectors $\\mathbf{u}_{i}(t)$ are described as a \"nearest-neighbor coupled set with free-end boundary conditions.\"\n-   **Output Definition**: The normalized stress relaxation function is $\\phi(t) = G(t)/G_e$, where $G_e$ is the plateau modulus. The problem states that $G(t)$ is proportional to the equilibrium autocorrelation of the entanglement segment orientation tensor.\n-   **Objective**: Derive the normal modes and relaxation rates for the dynamics of $\\mathbf{u}_i(t)$ and use them to find a closed-form analytical expression for $\\phi(t)$ in terms of $Z$, $k_s$, $\\zeta_e$, and $t$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is well-grounded in the theory of polymer physics. The slip-spring model is a recognized and studied coarse-grained model for polymer melts and concentrated solutions. The use of Langevin equations, normal mode analysis, and the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (or linear response theory) are standard methods in this field.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. The explicit instruction to model the segment dynamics as a \"nearest-neighbor coupled set with free-end boundary conditions\" defines the mathematical problem unequivocally, mapping it onto the well-known Rouse model framework. The objective is to derive a specific physical quantity, $\\phi(t)$, which has a unique functional form within this model.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language, free from any subjectivity.\n\n**Verdict**: The problem is valid. It presents a standard, albeit challenging, theoretical physics problem within the domain of multiscale modeling of polymers. The assumptions and directives are sufficient to construct and solve the mathematical model.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the normalized stress relaxation function $\\phi(t)$ for a polymer chain described by a slip-spring model. The dynamics of the $Z-1$ entanglement segment vectors, $\\mathbf{u}_i(t)$ for $i=1, \\dots, Z-1$, are specified to follow a nearest-neighbor coupled model with free-end boundary conditions. This is mathematically equivalent to the Rouse model for a chain of $M=Z-1$ effective beads, where the position vector of the $i$-th effective bead is given by $\\mathbf{u}_i$.\n\nThe dynamics are overdamped, so the Langevin equation for the $i$-th segment vector is given by:\n$$ \\zeta_e \\frac{d\\mathbf{u}_i}{dt} = \\mathbf{F}_i^{el} + \\mathbf{f}_i(t) $$\nwhere $\\zeta_e$ is the effective friction coefficient, $\\mathbf{F}_i^{el}$ is the elastic force on the segment, and $\\mathbf{f}_i(t)$ is the stochastic thermal force with $\\langle \\mathbf{f}_i(t) \\rangle = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nThe elastic force for a nearest-neighbor coupled set with spring constant $k$ is $\\mathbf{F}_i^{el} = k(\\mathbf{u}_{i+1} - 2\\mathbf{u}_i + \\mathbf{u}_{i-1})$. The problem specifies Hookean elasticity for the slip-springs with constant $k_s$, which we identify as the effective spring constant for this coarse-grained model, so $k=k_s$. The free-end boundary conditions are imposed by setting fictitious segments $\\mathbf{u}_0 = \\mathbf{u}_1$ and $\\mathbf{u}_Z = \\mathbf{u}_{Z-1}$. This leads to a system of $M=Z-1$ coupled linear differential equations. In matrix form, for the collection of vectors $\\mathbf{U} = (\\mathbf{u}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{u}_M)^T$:\n$$ \\zeta_e \\frac{d\\mathbf{U}}{dt} = -k_s \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{U} + \\mathbf{F}(t) $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{A}$ is the $M \\times M$ connectivity matrix for a free Rouse chain:\n$$ \\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -1 & 0 & \\dots & 0 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 & \\dots & 0 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 2 & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\ddots & -1 \\\\\n0 & \\dots & \\dots & -1 & 1 \n\\end{pmatrix} $$\nTo solve this system, we introduce normal modes $\\mathbf{X}_p$ by diagonalizing the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$.\n$$ \\mathbf{u}_i(t) = \\sum_{p=0}^{M-1} Q_{ip} \\mathbf{X}_p(t) $$\nwhere $Q_{ip}$ are the components of the eigenvectors of $\\mathbf{A}$. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}$ are well-known:\nThe eigenvalues are given by $\\lambda_p = 4 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{p\\pi}{2M}\\right)$ for $p = 0, 1, \\dots, M-1$.\nThe corresponding eigenvectors have components $Q_{ip} \\propto \\cos\\left(\\frac{p\\pi(i-1/2)}{M}\\right)$.\n\nThe Langevin equations for the normal modes are decoupled:\n$$ \\zeta_e \\frac{d\\mathbf{X}_p}{dt} = -k_s \\lambda_p \\mathbf{X}_p + \\tilde{\\mathbf{f}}_p(t) $$\nFor $p \\geq 1$, this describes Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics with a relaxation time $\\tau_p$:\n$$ \\tau_p = \\frac{\\zeta_e}{k_s \\lambda_p} = \\frac{\\zeta_e}{4 k_s \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{p\\pi}{2M}\\right)} $$\nFor $p=0$, $\\lambda_0=0$, so $\\tau_0=\\infty$. This zero-eigenvalue mode, $\\mathbf{X}_0 \\propto \\sum_{i=1}^M \\mathbf{u}_i$, corresponds to the center-of-mass motion of the segment vectors and does not relax but diffuses.\n\nThe stress relaxation function $G(t)$ reflects the relaxation of mechanical stress. In linear response theory, stress is generated by the internal modes of the system that are deformed by the applied strain. The $p=0$ mode represents a global translation and does not contribute to the stress. Therefore, $G(t)$ is a sum over the relaxing internal modes ($p \\geq 1$). Within the standard theory of rubber elasticity and its dynamic extension in the Rouse model, the modulus is a sum of contributions from the relaxing modes.\n$$ G(t) = \\sum_{p=1}^{M-1} G_p(t) = \\sum_{p=1}^{M-1} G_p(0) \\exp(-t/\\tau_p') $$\nThe problem is slightly ambiguous about the relationship between segment orientation and stress relaxation. The stress relaxation involves correlation of stress, which is quadratic in segment vectors, leading to relaxation times of $\\tau_p/2$. However, \"proportional to the equilibrium autocorrelation of the entanglement segment orientation tensor\" can also be interpreted, in a common simplifying approximation, as $G(t) \\propto \\sum_i \\langle \\mathbf{u}_i(t)\\cdot \\mathbf{u}_i(0) \\rangle$. We will follow the more rigorous path where $G(t)$ is built from the relaxation of normal modes contributing to stress. The normalized function $\\phi(t)$ is defined as $G(t)/G_e = G(t)/G(0)$.\nThe contribution of each mode $p$ to the equilibrium modulus, $G_p(0)$, is proportional to the energy stored in that mode. By the equipartition theorem, the average energy of each mode is equal. However, the contribution to stress depends on the average squared amplitude of the mode coordinates, $\\langle |\\mathbf{X}_p|^2 \\rangle$. The potential energy in mode $p$ is $V_p = \\frac{1}{2} k_s \\lambda_p |\\mathbf{X}_p|^2$. Equipartition implies $\\langle V_p \\rangle = \\frac{3}{2} k_B T$, so $\\langle |\\mathbf{X}_p|^2 \\rangle = \\frac{3 k_B T}{k_s \\lambda_p}$.\n\nThe stress relaxation function $G(t)$ can be shown to be proportional to $\\sum_{p=1}^{M-1} \\langle|\\mathbf{X}_p|^2\\rangle \\exp(-t/\\tau_p)$. The weights for different modes in the relaxation spectrum are given by their mean square amplitudes.\nSo, we can write the time-dependent part of the modulus as:\n$$ G(t) \\propto \\sum_{p=1}^{M-1} \\langle |\\mathbf{X}_p(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_p(0)| \\rangle = \\sum_{p=1}^{M-1} \\langle |\\mathbf{X}_p|^2 \\rangle \\exp(-t/\\tau_p) $$\nThe plateau modulus $G_e$ corresponds to the value at $t=0$ for this model:\n$$ G_e = G(0) \\propto \\sum_{p=1}^{M-1} \\langle |\\mathbf{X}_p|^2 \\rangle $$\nThe normalized relaxation function is then:\n$$ \\phi(t) = \\frac{\\sum_{p=1}^{M-1} \\langle |\\mathbf{X}_p|^2 \\rangle \\exp(-t/\\tau_p)}{\\sum_{p=1}^{M-1} \\langle |\\mathbf{X}_p|^2 \\rangle} $$\nSubstituting $\\langle |\\mathbf{X}_p|^2 \\rangle \\propto 1/\\lambda_p$:\n$$ \\phi(t) = \\frac{\\sum_{p=1}^{M-1} \\frac{1}{\\lambda_p} \\exp(-t/\\tau_p)}{\\sum_{p=1}^{M-1} \\frac{1}{\\lambda_p}} $$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $\\lambda_p$ and $\\tau_p$, and replace $M$ with $Z-1$. The summation runs from $p=1$ to $M-1=Z-2$.\n$$ \\lambda_p = 4 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{p\\pi}{2(Z-1)}\\right) $$\n$$ \\tau_p = \\frac{\\zeta_e}{k_s \\lambda_p} = \\frac{\\zeta_e}{4 k_s \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{p\\pi}{2(Z-1)}\\right)} $$\nThus, the expression for $\\phi(t)$ becomes:\n$$ \\phi(t) = \\frac{\\sum_{p=1}^{Z-2} \\frac{1}{4 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{p\\pi}{2(Z-1)}\\right)} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4 k_s t}{\\zeta_e} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{p\\pi}{2(Z-1)}\\right)\\right)}{\\sum_{p=1}^{Z-2} \\frac{1}{4 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{p\\pi}{2(Z-1)}\\right)}} $$\nThe constant factor of $1/4$ in the numerator and denominator cancels. The final expression is:\n$$ \\phi(t) = \\frac{\\sum_{p=1}^{Z-2} \\frac{1}{\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{p\\pi}{2(Z-1)}\\right)} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4 k_s t}{\\zeta_e} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{p\\pi}{2(Z-1)}\\right)\\right)}{\\sum_{p=1}^{Z-2} \\frac{1}{\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{p\\pi}{2(Z-1)}\\right)}} $$\nThis expression gives the normalized stress relaxation function purely in terms of the given parameters $Z$, $k_s$, $\\zeta_e$, and time $t$, as required.",

BAOAB achieves second-order accuracy in the configurational invariant measure for general smooth potentials and is exact for quadratic forces in the configurational marginal, whereas Euler–Maruyama exhibits an $O(h)$ bias that inflates the positional variance for finite $h$.\n\nC. Euler–Maruyama and BAOAB have identical equilibrium weak accuracy for configurational statistics; any differences are solely in dynamical correlation properties and not in invariant measures.\n\nD. Euler–Maruyama has lower configurational bias than BAOAB at fixed $h$ due to injecting thermal noise only once per step, whereas BAOAB’s multiple substeps accumulate larger sampling error in the invariant measure for stiff harmonic forces.",

The overdamped Langevin equation becomes:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}x_{t} = -\\frac{k_s}{\\zeta} x_{t}\\, \\mathrm{d}t + \\sqrt{\\frac{2 k_{B} T}{\\zeta}}\\, \\mathrm{d}W_{t}\n$$\nThis is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. The Euler–Maruyama discretization with time step $h$ yields the following discrete-time update rule for the position $x_{n}$ at time $t_n = n h$:\n$$\nx_{n+1} = x_{n} - \\frac{k_s}{\\zeta} x_{n} h + \\sqrt{\\frac{2 k_{B} T h}{\\zeta}} Z_{n}\n$$\nwhere $Z_{n}$ are independent and identically distributed standard normal random variables, $Z_n \\sim N(0,1)$. This can be written as an autoregressive process of order $1$ (AR(1)):\n$$\nx_{n+1} = \\left(1 - \\frac{k_s h}{\\zeta}\\right) x_{n} + \\sqrt{\\frac{2 k_{B} T h}{\\zeta}} Z_{n}\n$$\nThis defines the affine update $x_{n} \\mapsto x_{n+1}$. Let $\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{EM}}(x)$ denote the variance of the stationary distribution of this Markov chain. In the stationary state, $\\mathrm{Var}(x_{n+1}) = \\mathrm{Var}(x_{n}) = \\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{EM}}(x)$. Taking the variance of both sides and using the independence of $x_n$ and $Z_n$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(x_{n+1}) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\left(1 - \\frac{k_s h}{\\zeta}\\right) x_{n} + \\sqrt{\\frac{2 k_{B} T h}{\\zeta}} Z_{n}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{EM}}(x) = \\left(1 - \\frac{k_s h}{\\zeta}\\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{EM}}(x) + \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2 k_{B} T h}{\\zeta}}\\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}(Z_n)\n$$\nSince $\\mathrm{Var}(Z_n) = 1$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{EM}}(x) \\left[1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{k_s h}{\\zeta}\\right)^2\\right] = \\frac{2 k_{B} T h}{\\zeta}\n$$\nThe term in the square brackets simplifies to:\n$$\n1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{2 k_s h}{\\zeta} + \\frac{k_s^2 h^2}{\\zeta^2}\\right) = \\frac{2 k_s h}{\\zeta} - \\frac{k_s^2 h^2}{\\zeta^2} = \\frac{k_s h}{\\zeta}\\left(2 - \\frac{k_s h}{\\zeta}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for the stationary variance $\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{EM}}(x)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{EM}}(x) = \\frac{2 k_{B} T h / \\zeta}{(k_s h / \\zeta)(2 - k_s h / \\zeta)} = \\frac{2 k_{B} T}{k_s(2 - k_s h / \\zeta)} = \\frac{k_B T / k_s}{1 - k_s h / (2\\zeta)}\n$$\nThe stability condition for the scheme is that the prefactor of $x_n$ has a magnitude less than $1$, $|1 - k_s h / \\zeta| < 1$, which requires $0 < k_s h / \\zeta < 2$.\n\nThe exact equilibrium variance is $\\mathrm{Var}(x) = k_{B} T / k_s$. The numerical variance is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{EM}}(x) = \\mathrm{Var}(x) \\left(1 - \\frac{k_s h}{2\\zeta}\\right)^{-1}\n$$\nTo find the leading-order bias for a small time step $h \\to 0$, we perform a Taylor expansion of $(1-u)^{-1} \\approx 1 + u + O(u^2)$ with $u = k_s h / (2\\zeta)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{EM}}(x) \\approx \\mathrm{Var}(x) \\left(1 + \\frac{k_s h}{2\\zeta}\\right) = \\frac{k_B T}{k_s} + \\frac{k_B T h}{2\\zeta}\n$$\nThe bias is $\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{EM}}(x) - \\mathrm{Var}(x) \\approx \\frac{k_B T h}{2\\zeta}$. This bias is of leading order $O(h)$ and is positive, meaning the Euler–Maruyama scheme artificially inflates the positional variance for any finite time step $h > 0$.\n\n**Part 2: BAOAB for Inertial Langevin Dynamics**\n\nThe BAOAB scheme is a symmetric operator splitting method for the inertial Langevin equation. The total Liouvillian operator governing the evolution of the phase-space density can be split into three parts, $L = L_A + L_B + L_O$, corresponding to ballistic drift (A), conservative force (B), and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck thermostat (O). The BAOAB integrator approximates the formal solution $\\exp(hL)$ by the symmetric composition:\n$$\n\\Psi_{h}^{\\text{BAOAB}} = \\exp(\\tfrac{h}{2}L_B)\\exp(\\tfrac{h}{2}L_A)\\exp(hL_O)\\exp(\\tfrac{h}{2}L_A)\\exp(\\tfrac{h}{2}L_B)\n$$\n-   **General Smooth Potentials:** For general smooth potentials, this symmetric composition ensures that the error in the generator for the numerical Markov chain has only even powers of $h$. This leads to the well-known result that the invariant measure preserved by the BAOAB scheme is a modified Boltzmann distribution that differs from the exact one by terms of order $O(h^2)$. Consequently, the error in configurational averages, such as the variance, is of order $O(h^2)$. This is a significant improvement over the $O(h)$ error of the simple Euler–Maruyama scheme. The argument relies on the time-reversibility of the algorithm and its symmetric structure, which causes cancellation of odd-order error terms.\n\n-   **Special Quadratic Case $U_{s}(x) = \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{s} x^{2}$:** In this case, the force is linear, $F(q) = -k_s q$. The dynamics of the A and B parts correspond to a linear harmonic oscillator. The maps generated by $\\exp(\\tau L_A)$ and $\\exp(\\tau L_B)$ are linear transformations in phase space $(q, p)$. The O-step, which is an exact integration of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for momentum, applies an affine transformation to the momentum variable. The overall BAOAB integrator for one step is therefore a composition of linear and affine maps. The target equilibrium distribution, $\\rho(q, p) \\propto \\exp(-\\beta (p^2/(2m) + k_s q^2/2))$, is a multivariate Gaussian distribution. A key property of Gaussian distributions is that they remain Gaussian under affine transformations. This implies that the stationary distribution preserved by the BAOAB scheme for a harmonic oscillator must be a Gaussian. Since the scheme is consistent with the original SDE (i.e., it converges to the correct continuous-time process as $h \\to 0$), its unique Gaussian invariant distribution must be the exact Boltzmann distribution. Therefore, for a quadratic potential, the BAOAB scheme samples the exact joint distribution $\\rho(q, p)$ for any time step $h$ within the stability region. This implies that all marginal statistics, including the configurational variance $\\mathrm{Var}(q)$, are exact. There is zero bias.\n\n**Summary of Findings**\n-   **Euler–Maruyama:** Produces a stationary variance with a leading-order error of $O(h)$. The variance is artificially inflated. Weak accuracy for the invariant measure is first-order.\n-   **BAOAB:** For general potentials, the invariant measure has an error of $O(h^2)$. For the specific case of a harmonic potential, it samples the exact equilibrium distribution, meaning the error is zero.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n-   **A. Euler–Maruyama preserves the exact Boltzmann configurational distribution for harmonic slip-springs at any h, while BAOAB introduces an $O(h)$ bias in the positional variance.**\n    This statement is contrary to our findings. Euler-Maruyama introduces an $O(h)$ bias, while BAOAB is exact for the harmonic case.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **B. BAOAB achieves second-order accuracy in the configurational invariant measure for general smooth potentials and is exact for quadratic forces in the configurational marginal, whereas Euler–Maruyama exhibits an $O(h)$ bias that inflates the positional variance for finite h.**\n    This statement perfectly summarizes the derived results. BAOAB is $O(h^2)$ accurate in general and exact for quadratic forces. Euler-Maruyama has an $O(h)$ bias that is positive (inflation of variance).\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **C. Euler–Maruyama and BAOAB have identical equilibrium weak accuracy for configurational statistics; any differences are solely in dynamical correlation properties and not in invariant measures.**\n    This is false. Their accuracy for the invariant measure is fundamentally different: $O(h)$ for Euler-Maruyama versus $O(h^2)$ (or exact) for BAOAB.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D. Euler–Maruyama has lower configurational bias than BAOAB at fixed h due to injecting thermal noise only once per step, whereas BAOAB’s multiple substeps accumulate larger sampling error in the invariant measure for stiff harmonic forces.**\n    This is incorrect on two counts. First, BAOAB has a much lower (or zero) configurational bias. Second, the reasoning is flawed; the accuracy of an integrator's invariant measure is determined by its structure (e.g., symmetry) rather than the number of noise-injection steps. For harmonic forces, BAOAB is exact, having a bias of zero, which is strictly lower than the positive bias of Euler-Maruyama.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
