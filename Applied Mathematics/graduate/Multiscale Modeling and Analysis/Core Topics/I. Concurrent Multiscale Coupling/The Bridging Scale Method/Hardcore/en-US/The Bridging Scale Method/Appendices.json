            "problem": "Consider the Bridging Scale Method (BSM) in multiscale modeling, where two discretizations of a continuum field are blended over an overlap region to avoid double counting of energy and to enforce consistency. Let the overlap region be covered by two Finite Element Method (FEM) meshes that occupy the same physical domain in the overlap: a coarse mesh and a fine mesh, each composed of two-dimensional triangular elements. On any triangle $T$, denote by the barycentric coordinate shape functions $\\lambda_{T,1}(\\mathbf{x})$, $\\lambda_{T,2}(\\mathbf{x})$, and $\\lambda_{T,3}(\\mathbf{x})$ the standard piecewise linear nodal basis functions, which satisfy $\\lambda_{T,i}(\\mathbf{x}) \\ge 0$ on $T$, $\\lambda_{T,i}(\\mathbf{x})=0$ outside $T$, and $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\lambda_{T,i}(\\mathbf{x}) = 1$ for all $\\mathbf{x} \\in T$. Define the characteristic function of a triangle $T$ by $\\chi_{T}(\\mathbf{x})$, which equals $1$ if $\\mathbf{x} \\in T$ and $0$ otherwise.\n\nFor each global node index $i$ appearing in either mesh, define the local contribution\n$$\n\\phi_{i}(\\mathbf{x}) := \\sum_{T \\in \\mathcal{E}(i)} \\chi_{T}(\\mathbf{x}) \\,\\lambda_{T,i}(\\mathbf{x}),\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{E}(i)$ denotes the set of all triangles (across both meshes) that contain node $i$, and $\\lambda_{T,i}(\\mathbf{x})$ is understood to be the local shape function on triangle $T$ associated with node $i$ if $i$ is a vertex of $T$, and $0$ otherwise.

            "solution": "The problem requires the construction of a scalar kernel $w(\\mathbf{x})$ and a demonstration that it helps form a partition of unity with the given functions $\\phi_i(\\mathbf{x})$. The core of the task is to analyze the properties of the sum of all functions $\\phi_i(\\mathbf{x})$.\n\nLet us define the sum $S(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_i \\phi_i(\\mathbf{x})$, where the summation is over all global node indices $i$ present in either the coarse or the fine mesh. The problem statement provides the definition of $\\phi_i(\\mathbf{x})$ as:\n$$\n\\phi_{i}(\\mathbf{x}) := \\sum_{T \\in \\mathcal{E}(i)} \\chi_{T}(\\mathbf{x}) \\,\\lambda_{T,i}(\\mathbf{x})\n$$\nHere, $\\mathcal{E}(i)$ is the set of all triangles from both meshes that have node $i$ as a vertex, $\\chi_T(\\mathbf{x})$ is the characteristic function for triangle $T$, and $\\lambda_{T,i}(\\mathbf{x})$ is the barycentric coordinate shape function associated with node $i$ on triangle $T$.\n\nSubstituting the definition of $\\phi_i(\\mathbf{x})$ into the sum $S(\\mathbf{x})$, we get:\n$$\nS(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_i \\left( \\sum_{T \\in \\mathcal{E}(i)} \\chi_{T}(\\mathbf{x}) \\,\\lambda_{T,i}(\\mathbf{x}) \\right)\n$$\nThis represents a sum over all nodes $i$, and for each node, a sum over all triangles $T$ attached to it. We can reorder the summation to first sum over all triangles $T$ in both meshes, and then sum over the nodes $i$ that are vertices of that triangle. Let $\\mathcal{T}_c$ be the set of triangles in the coarse mesh and $\\mathcal{T}_f$ be the set of triangles in the fine mesh. The total set of triangles is $\\mathcal{T} = \\mathcal{T}_c \\cup \\mathcal{T}_f$. Let $V(T)$ denote the set of vertex indices for a given triangle $T$. The reordered sum is:\n$$\nS(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{T \\in \\mathcal{T}} \\sum_{i \\in V(T)} \\chi_{T}(\\mathbf{x}) \\,\\lambda_{T,i}(\\mathbf{x})\n$$\nFor a fixed triangle $T$, the characteristic function $\\chi_T(\\mathbf{x})$ does not depend on the index $i$, so we can factor it out of the inner sum:\n$$\nS(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{T \\in \\mathcal{T}} \\chi_{T}(\\mathbf{x}) \\left( \\sum_{i \\in V(T)} \\lambda_{T,i}(\\mathbf{x}) \\right)\n$$\nA fundamental property of barycentric coordinate shape functions for a triangle $T$ is that they form a partition of unity on that triangle. That is, for any point $\\mathbf{x} \\in T$, the sum of the shape functions is equal to $1$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i \\in V(T)} \\lambda_{T,i}(\\mathbf{x}) = 1 \\quad \\text{for all } \\mathbf{x} \\in T\n$$\nSince the characteristic function $\\chi_T(\\mathbf{x})$ is non-zero (equal to $1$) only when $\\mathbf{x} \\in T$, the expression in the parenthesis can be replaced by $1$:\n$$\nS(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{T \\in \\mathcal{T}} \\chi_{T}(\\mathbf{x}) \\cdot 1 = \\sum_{T \\in \\mathcal{T}_c \\cup \\mathcal{T}_f} \\chi_{T}(\\mathbf{x})\n$$\nWe can split this sum into contributions from the coarse mesh and the fine mesh:\n$$\nS(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{T \\in \\mathcal{T}_c} \\chi_{T}(\\mathbf{x}) + \\sum_{T \\in \\mathcal{T}_f} \\chi_{T}(\\mathbf{x})\n$$\nThe problem states that the overlap region is covered by two FEM meshes. A standard FEM mesh forms a partition of the domain it covers. This means that for any point $\\mathbf{x}$ in the domain, it belongs to the closure of at least one triangle, and the interiors of the triangles are disjoint. Thus, the sum of the characteristic functions over all triangles in a single mesh covering the domain is equal to $1$ for any point $\\mathbf{x}$ in that domain. (Strictly, this holds for points in the interior of triangles. For points on edges or vertices, standard conventions in FEM ensure the partition of unity property of the global basis functions holds, and our derivation leading to the sum of characteristic functions is consistent with this.)\n\nTherefore, for any point $\\mathbf{x}$ in the overlap region:\n$$\n\\sum_{T \\in \\mathcal{T}_c} \\chi_{T}(\\mathbf{x}) = 1\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\sum_{T \\in \\mathcal{T}_f} \\chi_{T}(\\mathbf{x}) = 1\n$$\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $S(\\mathbf{x})$, we find:\n$$\nS(\\mathbf{x}) = 1 + 1 = 2\n$$\nSo, we have shown that $\\sum_i \\phi_i(\\mathbf{x}) = 2$ for all $\\mathbf{x}$ in the overlap region.\n\nNow we can construct the kernel $w(\\mathbf{x})$. The problem asks to find $w(\\mathbf{x})$ such that $\\sum_{i} w(\\mathbf{x}) \\,\\phi_{i}(\\mathbf{x}) = 1$. We can rewrite this as:\n$$\nw(\\mathbf{x}) \\left( \\sum_{i} \\phi_{i}(\\mathbf{x}) \\right) = 1\n$$\nSubstituting our result for the sum:\n$$\nw(\\mathbf{x}) \\cdot 2 = 1\n$$\nThis gives $w(\\mathbf{x}) = 1/2$. We construct the kernel $w(\\mathbf{x})$ as follows:\n$$\nw(\\mathbf{x}) = \\begin{cases} 1/2 & \\text{if } \\mathbf{x} \\text{ is in the overlap region} \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThis constructed kernel $w(\\mathbf{x})$ is a scalar function. It is nonnegative. By definition, it has compact support within the overlap region. Its construction is based entirely on the analysis of the functions $\\{\\phi_i(\\mathbf{x})\\}$ and the properties of barycentric coordinates, as required.\n\nFinally, we demonstrate by direct calculation that this choice of $w(\\mathbf{x})$ satisfies the required identity for any $\\mathbf{x}$ in the overlap region:\n$$\n\\sum_{i} w(\\mathbf{x}) \\,\\phi_{i}(\\mathbf{x}) = w(\\mathbf{x}) \\sum_{i} \\phi_{i}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\cdot (2) = 1\n$$\nThis completes the demonstration. The problem asks for the single exact number that results from this calculation, which is the value of the demonstrated sum. The value is $1$.",

The nodal displacements of the FE are $U_1$ (left node) and $U_2$ (right node), and the displacement field inside the element is taken to be the linear interpolation compatible with the two-node shape functions, producing a constant deformation gradient $F = 1 + \\frac{U_2 - U_1}{L_0}$ within the element.\n\nAt the atomic scale, the energy of a bond of current length $r$ is given by the harmonic spring energy $E_b = \\frac{1}{2} k (r - a_0)^2$.

            "solution": "The derivation proceeds in three parts as requested: first by using the virtual work equivalence of the bridging scale method, second by using the Cauchy-Born a priori assumption, and finally by comparing the two results.\n\n**1. Derivation of Coarse Stress $P$ via Virtual Work Equivalence**\n\nThe bridging scale method postulates the equality of internal virtual work at the continuum and atomistic scales:\n$$\n\\delta W^{\\text{cont}} = \\delta W^{\\text{atom}}\n$$\n\nFirst, we express the continuum internal virtual work, $\\delta W^{\\text{cont}}$. For a one-dimensional body of reference length $L_0$ under a first Piola-Kirchhoff stress $P$, the internal virtual work is given by:\n$$\n\\delta W^{\\text{cont}} = \\int_{0}^{L_0} P \\, \\delta F \\, dX\n$$\nwhere $\\delta F$ is the variation of the deformation gradient. The problem states that the FE interpolation is linear, giving a constant deformation gradient $F = 1 + \\frac{U_2 - U_1}{L_0}$. Since $F$ is constant throughout the element, the stress $P(F)$ is also constant. The variation $\\delta F$ is then:\n$$\n\\delta F = \\delta \\left(1 + \\frac{U_2 - U_1}{L_0}\\right) = \\frac{\\delta U_2 - \\delta U_1}{L_0}\n$$\nThis variation is also constant over the element. The integral for $\\delta W^{\\text{cont}}$ simplifies to:\n$$\n\\delta W^{\\text{cont}} = P \\cdot \\delta F \\cdot L_0 = P \\left(\\frac{\\delta U_2 - \\delta U_1}{L_0}\\right) L_0 = P (\\delta U_2 - \\delta U_1)\n$$\n\nNext, we express the atomistic internal virtual work, $\\delta W^{\\text{atom}}$. This is the variation of the total potential energy of the atoms within the element. The element spans $N$ bonds, connecting $N+1$ atoms, indexed from $j=0$ to $j=N$. Let the reference position of atom $j$ be $X_j = j a_0$. The displacement of atom $j$, $u_j$, is dictated by the FE shape functions:\n$$\nu_j = u(X_j) = U_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{X_j}{L_0}\\right) + U_2 \\left(\\frac{X_j}{L_0}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $X_j = j a_0$ and $L_0 = N a_0$:\n$$\nu_j = U_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{j a_0}{N a_0}\\right) + U_2 \\left(\\frac{j a_0}{N a_0}\\right) = U_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{j}{N}\\right) + U_2 \\left(\\frac{j}{N}\\right)\n$$\nThe current length, $r_j$, of the bond between atom $j$ and atom $j+1$ is:\n$$\nr_j = (X_{j+1} + u_{j+1}) - (X_j + u_j) = (X_{j+1} - X_j) + (u_{j+1} - u_j) = a_0 + (u_{j+1} - u_j)\n$$\nThe displacement difference is:\n$$\nu_{j+1} - u_j = \\left[ U_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{j+1}{N}\\right) + U_2 \\left(\\frac{j+1}{N}\\right) \\right] - \\left[ U_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{j}{N}\\right) + U_2 \\left(\\frac{j}{N}\\right) \\right] = U_1\\left(-\\frac{1}{N}\\right) + U_2\\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right) = \\frac{U_2 - U_1}{N}\n$$\nCrucially, this difference is constant for every bond within the element due to the linear displacement field. Thus, all bonds have the same current length $r$:\n$$\nr = a_0 + \\frac{U_2 - U_1}{N}\n$$\nThe energy of a single bond is $E_b = \\frac{1}{2} k (r - a_0)^2$. Substituting the expression for $r$:\n$$\nE_b = \\frac{1}{2} k \\left( \\left(a_0 + \\frac{U_2 - U_1}{N}\\right) - a_0 \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} k \\left(\\frac{U_2 - U_1}{N}\\right)^2\n$$\nThe total energy of the $N$ bonds in the element, $E_{\\text{total}}$, is:\n$$\nE_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} E_b = N \\cdot E_b = N \\frac{1}{2} k \\left(\\frac{U_2 - U_1}{N}\\right)^2 = \\frac{k}{2N} (U_2 - U_1)^2\n$$\nThe atomistic virtual work is the variation of this total energy with respect to the nodal displacements:\n$$\n\\delta W^{\\text{atom}} = \\delta E_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{\\partial E_{\\text{total}}}{\\partial U_1} \\delta U_1 + \\frac{\\partial E_{\\text{total}}}{\\partial U_2} \\delta U_2\n$$\nCalculating the partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E_{\\text{total}}}{\\partial U_1} = \\frac{k}{2N} \\cdot 2(U_2 - U_1) \\cdot (-1) = -\\frac{k}{N} (U_2 - U_1)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E_{\\text{total}}}{\\partial U_2} = \\frac{k}{2N} \\cdot 2(U_2 - U_1) \\cdot (1) = \\frac{k}{N} (U_2 - U_1)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\delta W^{\\text{atom}}$:\n$$\n\\delta W^{\\text{atom}} = \\frac{k}{N}(U_2 - U_1) \\delta U_2 - \\frac{k}{N}(U_2 - U_1) \\delta U_1 = \\frac{k}{N}(U_2 - U_1) (\\delta U_2 - \\delta U_1)\n$$\nNow, we enforce the virtual work equivalence, $\\delta W^{\\text{cont}} = \\delta W^{\\text{atom}}$:\n$$\nP (\\delta U_2 - \\delta U_1) = \\frac{k}{N}(U_2 - U_1) (\\delta U_2 - \\delta U_1)\n$$\nSince this equality must hold for any admissible virtual displacement field (i.e., for any $\\delta U_1, \\delta U_2$), we can conclude that the coefficients of the term $(\\delta U_2 - \\delta U_1)$ must be equal. This yields the expression for the coarse stress $P$:\n$$\nP = \\frac{k}{N} (U_2 - U_1)\n$$\nTo express this in the required variables, we substitute $N = L_0/a_0$:\n$$\nP = \\frac{k}{L_0/a_0} (U_2 - U_1) = \\frac{k a_0}{L_0} (U_2 - U_1)\n$$\n\n**2. Derivation of Cauchy-Born Stress $P^{\\text{CB}}$**\n\nThe Cauchy-Born (CB) theory posits that the deformation of the crystal lattice locally follows the macroscopic deformation gradient $F$. For a $1$D chain, a bond with reference length $a_0$ is deformed to a current length $r$ given by:\n$$\nr = F a_0\n$$\nThe strain energy stored in this single bond is:\n$$\nE_b = \\frac{1}{2} k (r - a_0)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} k (F a_0 - a_0)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} k a_0^2 (F - 1)^2\n$$\nThe CB strain energy density, $W(F)$, is defined as the strain energy per unit reference volume. In $1$D, this is the energy per unit reference length. The reference length associated with one bond is $a_0$.\n$$\nW(F) = \\frac{E_b}{a_0} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} k a_0^2 (F - 1)^2}{a_0} = \\frac{1}{2} k a_0 (F - 1)^2\n$$\nThe first Piola-Kirchhoff stress, $P^{\\text{CB}}$, is thermodynamically conjugate to the deformation gradient $F$ and is given by the derivative of the strain energy density with respect to $F$:\n$$\nP^{\\text{CB}} = \\frac{dW}{dF} = \\frac{d}{dF} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} k a_0 (F - 1)^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} k a_0 \\cdot 2(F - 1) \\cdot 1 = k a_0 (F - 1)\n$$\n\n**3. Verification**\n\nTo verify that the stress from the bridging scale projection equals the Cauchy-Born stress, we express $P^{\\text{CB}}$ in terms of the FE nodal displacements. We substitute the given expression for the deformation gradient, $F = 1 + \\frac{U_2 - U_1}{L_0}$, into the equation for $P^{\\text{CB}}$:\n$$\nP^{\\text{CB}} = k a_0 \\left( \\left(1 + \\frac{U_2 - U_1}{L_0}\\right) - 1 \\right) = k a_0 \\left(\\frac{U_2 - U_1}{L_0}\\right) = \\frac{k a_0}{L_0} (U_2 - U_1)\n$$\nComparing this with the result from the virtual work equivalence:\n$$\nP = \\frac{k a_0}{L_0} (U_2 - U_1)\n$$\nWe find that $P = P^{\\text{CB}}$. The verification is successful. This result shows that for a harmonic lattice and a linear interpolation of the displacement field, the bridging scale method exactly reproduces the Cauchy-Born constitutive law. The final expression for the coarse stress $P$ is:\n$$\nP = \\frac{k a_0}{L_0} (U_2 - U_1)\n$$\nThis expression depends only on the requested variables $U_1$, $U_2$, $L_0$, $k$, and $a_0$.",

The chain comprises $N$ atoms with reference spacing $a_0$ and linear pairwise nearest-neighbor interactions of stiffness $k$, subject to a uniform deformation characterized by strain $\\varepsilon$. The atomistic positions under the uniform deformation are $x_i = i a_0 (1+\\varepsilon)$ for $i \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,N-1\\}$. The interactions are defined by the harmonic pair potential $\\phi(r) = \\tfrac{1}{2}k(r-a_0)^2$, and the equilibrium force on an interior atom $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le N-2$) in the fully atomistic chain is given by $F_i = \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} \\sum_j \\phi(|x_{j+1}-x_j|)$, which simplifies for nearest neighbors to\n$$\nF_i = k\\left[(x_{i+1}-x_i - a_0) - (x_i - x_{i-1} - a_0)\\right].\n$$\nThis embodies Newton’s Second Law equilibrium condition in the static regime.\n\nDefine a coupling interface at index $m$ such that atoms with $i \\le m$ are treated as the atomistic region and atoms with $i \\ge m+1$ are treated as the continuum region. A naive coupling (intended to represent a non-bridged, inconsistent interface treatment) omits the bond that crosses the interface, i.e., it neglects the pair interaction between atoms $m$ and $m+1$. In this naive model, the interior forces are computed as above for all $i$ except that the cross-interface bond contribution is removed, so that atom $m$ does not include the right-neighbor contribution and atom $m+1$ does not include the left-neighbor contribution. This omission models a typical source of ghost forces.\n\nIn contrast, a properly constructed BSM coupling aims to ensure energy consistency and eliminates ghost forces under uniform deformation. For this problem, model the properly constructed coupling by ensuring that the cross-interface bond is accounted exactly once, producing the same discrete force formula as the fully atomistic chain. This idealized representation captures the diagnostic signature of a correct bridging-scale coupling under uniform strain: forces should vanish in the interior up to numerical tolerance.\n\nYour task is to implement the following numerical experiment to detect ghost forces:\n- Apply the uniform deformation $x_i = i a_0 (1+\\varepsilon)$ to the chain.\n- Compute the interior force distribution $\\{F_i\\}_{i=1}^{N-2}$ for the naive coupling (with the omitted interface bond) and for the properly constructed coupling (with the interface bond counted once).\n- Use a detection threshold $\\tau$ to classify ghost forces: any interior atom $i$ with $|F_i| > \\tau$ is flagged as exhibiting a ghost force.\n\nAssume nondimensional units (i.e., take $a_0 = 1$ and $k = 1$), and use a decimal threshold $\\tau = 10^{-12}$. Angles are not involved. The Bridging Scale Method (BSM) often employs an overlap region of width $w$ with a blending function to ensure consistency; include $w$ as a parameter in the test cases to validate that, under uniform deformation, the properly constructed coupling eliminates ghost forces independently of $w$ in this simplified one-dimensional setting.\n\nImplement a program that, for each test case, returns a list containing:\n- The maximum absolute interior force in the naive coupling, as a float.\n- The maximum absolute interior force in the proper coupling, as a float.\n- A boolean indicating whether ghost forces are detected in the naive coupling (true if any $|F_i| > \\tau$).\n- A boolean indicating whether ghost forces are detected in the proper coupling (true if any $|F_i| > \\tau$).\n- A list of interior indices $i$ where $|F_i| > \\tau$ for the naive coupling.\n- A list of interior indices $i$ where $|F_i| > \\tau$ for the proper coupling.\n\nTest suite parameters (each test case is a tuple $(N,\\varepsilon,m,w)$):\n- Case $1$: $(50, 0.05, 25, 10)$ — a typical chain with moderate strain and centered interface.\n- Case $2$: $(50, 0.0, 25, 10)$ — zero strain as a boundary condition test.\n- Case $3$: $(10, 0.08, 5, 1)$ — short chain and minimal overlap width.\n- Case $4$: $(101, 0.1, 50, 20)$ — odd-sized chain and larger strain.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each test case’s result is a sublist in the order given above (for example, $[\\,[\\dots],\\,[\\dots],\\,[\\dots],\\,[\\dots]\\,]$).

            "solution": "The problem requires the implementation of a numerical experiment to detect \"ghost forces\" in a one-dimensional (1D) multiscale model of an atomic chain. Ghost forces are spurious, non-physical forces that arise at the interface between an atomistic region and a continuum region when the coupling between them is inconsistent. The experiment compares a \"naive\" coupling, which is designed to be inconsistent, with a \"proper\" coupling that accurately represents the underlying physics.\n\nThe foundation of the model is a 1D chain of $N$ atoms with reference (unstrained) spacing $a_0$. The interaction between nearest-neighbor atoms is described by a harmonic potential $\\phi(r) = \\tfrac{1}{2}k(r-a_0)^2$, where $r$ is the interatomic distance and $k$ is the stiffness. The force on an atom $i$ is derived from the total potential energy $U = \\sum_{j} \\phi(|x_{j+1}-x_j|)$ via $F_i = -\\partial U/\\partial x_i$. For an interior atom $i$ (i.e., $1 \\le i \\le N-2$), this yields the discrete force law:\n$$\nF_i = k\\left[(x_{i+1}-x_i - a_0) - (x_i - x_{i-1} - a_0)\\right]\n$$\nThis expression represents the net force on atom $i$ from its interactions with its right neighbor ($i+1$) and left neighbor ($i-1$).\n\nThe chain is subjected to a uniform strain $\\varepsilon$, resulting in atomic positions $x_i = i a_0 (1+\\varepsilon)$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$.

This coupling is defined to be consistent, meaning it correctly computes the forces across the interface. In this idealized problem, this is modeled by using the full atomistic force law given above for all interior atoms. Let us substitute the positions $x_i = i a_0 (1+\\varepsilon)$ into the force expression. The distance between adjacent atoms is uniform:\n$$\nx_{i+1} - x_i = (i+1) a_0 (1+\\varepsilon) - i a_0 (1+\\varepsilon) = a_0(1+\\varepsilon)\n$$\nThe force on any interior atom $i$ is therefore:\n$$\nF_i = k\\left[ (a_0(1+\\varepsilon) - a_0) - (a_0(1+\\varepsilon) - a_0) \\right] = k [ a_0\\varepsilon - a_0\\varepsilon ] = 0\n$$\nThis result is fundamental. For a uniform strain, there are no net forces on interior atoms in a perfect lattice. This is the atomistic equivalent of the continuum statement that a uniform strain field produces a uniform stress field with no internal body forces. A correctly formulated multiscale method must reproduce this behavior; this is known as a \"patch test.\" Thus, for the proper coupling, we expect all interior forces to be zero, up to numerical floating-point precision.\n\nNext, we analyze the \"naive coupling\". This scheme models an inconsistent interface by simply omitting the interaction between atom $m$ and atom $m+1$. This means the term $\\phi(|x_{m+1}-x_m|)$ is removed from the total energy. Consequently, the force calculations for atoms $m$ and $m+1$ are altered.\n- For atom $i=m$: The force contribution from its right neighbor ($m+1$) is absent. The only remaining contribution is from its left neighbor ($m-1$), leading to $F_m = -k(x_m - x_{m-1} - a_0)$. Substituting the positions gives:\n$$\nF_m = -k(a_0(1+\\varepsilon) - a_0) = -k a_0 \\varepsilon\n$$\n- For atom $i=m+1$: The force contribution from its left neighbor ($m$) is absent. The only remaining contribution is from its right neighbor ($m+2$), leading to $F_{m+1} = k(x_{m+2} - x_{m+1} - a_0)$. Substituting the positions gives:\n$$\nF_{m+1} = k(a_0(1+\\varepsilon) - a_0) = k a_0 \\varepsilon\n$$\n- For all other interior atoms ($i \\neq m, i \\neq m+1$), the standard formula applies, and the force is zero.\n\nThe non-zero forces $F_m = -k a_0 \\varepsilon$ and $F_{m+1} = k a_0 \\varepsilon$ are the \"ghost forces.\" They are artifacts of the inconsistent coupling and do not represent any real physics. They are localized to the interface. The larger the strain $\\varepsilon$, the larger the ghost forces.\n\nThe numerical implementation will proceed as follows. For each test case $(N, \\varepsilon, m, w)$, we set the dimensionless parameters $a_0=1$ and $k=1$. The parameter $w$ for overlap width is conceptually relevant for more complex blending functions in BSM but is not used in the calculation for this idealized problem, thereby demonstrating that for uniform strain, the results for a perfect coupling are independent of such parameters.\n1.  Generate the array of atom positions $x_i = i(1+\\varepsilon)$.\n2.  Calculate the interior forces $\\{F_i\\}_{i=1}^{N-2}$ for the proper coupling. Based on our analysis, these should be numerically close to zero. The vectorized computation is $F_i = x_{i+1} - 2x_i + x_{i-1}$.\n3.  Calculate the interior forces for the naive coupling. The forces are zero everywhere except at $i=m$ and $i=m+1$, where $F_m = -\\varepsilon$ and $F_{m+1} = \\varepsilon$.\n4.  For both force distributions, find the maximum absolute force among all interior atoms.\n5.  Compare these maximums against the threshold $\\tau = 10^{-12}$ to determine if ghost forces are present.\n6.  Identify the specific indices $i$ of interior atoms where $|F_i| > \\tau$.\n\nThis procedure will quantitatively demonstrate that the naive coupling generates significant ghost forces (proportional to $\\varepsilon$) at the interface, while the proper coupling correctly yields zero force, passing the consistency test.",
