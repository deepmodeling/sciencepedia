            "problem": "A heterogeneous elastic bar of length $L$ with periodic microstructure is subjected to a spatially varying macroscopic body force whose characteristic wavelength is denoted by $\\lambda$. The bar’s heterogeneous stiffness is modeled by a coefficient $A(y)$ that is smooth, bounded, and $1$-periodic in its argument $y$, and the microscopic heterogeneity enters the strong form of the static equilibrium through the scaling $y = x / \\ell$, where $\\ell$ is the characteristic grain size. The quasistatic displacement field $u(x)$ is governed by the one-dimensional elliptic boundary value problem\n$$\n- \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\left( A\\!\\left(\\frac{x}{\\ell}\\right) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u(x)}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\right) = f(x),\n$$\nwhere $f(x)$ is the macroscopic forcing whose spatial variation is characterized by the wavelength $\\lambda$, so that $f$ varies appreciably over distances of order $\\lambda$. In homogenization theory, the validity of replacing the heterogeneous medium by an effective homogeneous medium hinges on the existence of a small nondimensional parameter that expresses a clear separation between the microscopic and macroscopic length scales.\n\nStarting from this governing equation and using nondimensionalization based on the macroscopic wavelength $\\lambda$ (not the bar length $L$), derive the appropriate small nondimensional parameter that quantifies micro–macro scale separation in this setting.

Express the answer as a dimensionless number.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the small nondimensional parameter that quantifies the micro-macro scale separation for a one-dimensional heterogeneous elastic bar, followed by its numerical calculation.\n\nThe governing equation for the static equilibrium of the bar is given as:\n$$\n- \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\left( A\\!\\left(\\frac{x}{\\ell}\\right) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u(x)}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\right) = f(x)\n$$\nHere, $x$ is the spatial coordinate along the bar. The problem involves three distinct length scales:\n1.  The characteristic size of the microscopic heterogeneities, or grain size, $\\ell$.\n2.  The characteristic wavelength of the macroscopic body force, $\\lambda$, which dictates the length scale over which the macroscopic fields (like the forcing $f(x)$ and the resulting displacement $u(x)$) vary significantly.\n3.  The overall length of the bar, $L$.\n\nIn the theory of homogenization, the possibility of replacing a heterogeneous medium with an effective homogeneous one rests upon a clear separation of scales. This is mathematically expressed by a small, nondimensional parameter, typically denoted by $\\varepsilon$, which is the ratio of the characteristic microscopic length scale to the characteristic macroscopic length scale.\n\nIn this problem, the microscopic length scale is explicitly identified as $\\ell$. The macroscopic length scale, as stated, is the characteristic wavelength $\\lambda$ of the applied load. Thus, the nondimensional parameter $\\varepsilon$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\ell}{\\lambda}\n$$\nThe condition for the validity of homogenization is that this parameter must be much smaller than unity, i.e., $\\varepsilon \\ll 1$.\n\nTo formally derive this from the governing equation, we perform a nondimensionalization based on the macroscopic length scale $\\lambda$, as instructed. We introduce a dimensionless spatial coordinate $\\bar{x}$ defined by:\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{x}{\\lambda} \\implies x = \\lambda \\bar{x}\n$$\nUsing the chain rule, the derivative with respect to $x$ can be transformed into a derivative with respect to $\\bar{x}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{x}}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{x}} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{x}}\n$$\nNext, we examine the argument of the rapidly oscillating stiffness coefficient, $A(x/\\ell)$. In terms of the new dimensionless coordinate $\\bar{x}$, this argument becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{x}{\\ell} = \\frac{\\lambda \\bar{x}}{\\ell} = \\frac{1}{\\ell/\\lambda} \\bar{x}\n$$\nSubstituting our definition $\\varepsilon = \\ell/\\lambda$, the argument is $\\bar{x}/\\varepsilon$. This represents the \"fast\" spatial variable, which changes rapidly (by a factor of $1/\\varepsilon$) with respect to the \"slow\" macroscopic variable $\\bar{x}$.\n\nSubstituting these transformations into the governing differential equation yields:\n$$\n- \\left( \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{x}} \\right) \\left( A\\!\\left(\\frac{\\bar{x}}{\\varepsilon}\\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{x}} \\right) \\right) = f(\\lambda\\bar{x})\n$$\nMultiplying both sides by $\\lambda^2$ gives:\n$$\n- \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{x}} \\left( A\\!\\left(\\frac{\\bar{x}}{\\varepsilon}\\right) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{x}} \\right) = \\lambda^2 f(\\lambda\\bar{x})\n$$\nThis rescaled equation highlights the two-scale nature of the problem. The solution $u$ and the forcing term on the right-hand side vary over the macroscopic scale where $\\bar{x}$ is of order $1$. In contrast, the stiffness coefficient $A$ varies on the microscopic scale governed by the fast variable $\\bar{y} = \\bar{x}/\\varepsilon$. The parameter $\\varepsilon = \\ell/\\lambda$ is precisely the nondimensional quantity that formalizes this scale separation. A small value of $\\varepsilon$ indicates that the material properties oscillate many times over the distance that the macroscopic fields change appreciably, which is the fundamental assumption of homogenization theory.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of this parameter using the provided data:\n- Microscopic length scale: $\\ell = 10 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n- Macroscopic length scale: $\\lambda = 1 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$\nThe length of the bar, $L = 10 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$, is part of the problem's physical description but is not needed to compute the scale separation parameter $\\varepsilon$, as the macroscopic scale is defined by the forcing, not the domain size.\n\nTo calculate the dimensionless ratio $\\varepsilon$, we first convert the lengths to a consistent unit, for instance, meters (m):\n$$\n\\ell = 10 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 10 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{m} = 1 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{m}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda = 1 \\, \\mathrm{mm} = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{m}\n$$\nNow, we compute the ratio:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\ell}{\\lambda} = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{m}}{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{m}} = 1 \\times 10^{-5 - (-3)} = 1 \\times 10^{-2}\n$$\nSo, $\\varepsilon = 0.01$.\n\nThe problem requires the final numerical value to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\varepsilon = 0.01000\n$$\nIn standard scientific notation, this is $1.000 \\times 10^{-2}$. The magnitude of this parameter, being $0.01 \\ll 1$, confirms that there is a significant separation of scales, and thus the application of homogenization techniques is well justified in this scenario.",

Comparing this with the previous equation gives the Voigt estimate for the effective modulus, denoted as $E_V$:\n$$\nE_V = v_1 E_1 + v_2 E_2\n$$\nThis is the rule of mixtures and represents a rigorous upper bound for the actual effective modulus, $E_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\le E_V$.

For $a > |b|$, the formula is $\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\theta}{a+b\\sin\\theta} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{a^2-b^2}}$. Here, $a=a_0$ and $b=\\delta$. The condition $|\\delta|<a_0$ is given, so the formula applies.\n$$\n\\langle A^{-1} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{a_0^2 - \\delta^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a_0^2 - \\delta^2}}\n$$\nTherefore, the harmonic mean is:\n$$\nA^{\\mathrm{hom}}_{11} = \\langle A^{-1} \\rangle^{-1} = \\sqrt{a_0^2 - \\delta^2}\n$$\nCombining these results, the homogenized conductivity tensor is:\n$$\nA^{\\mathrm{hom}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{a_0^2 - \\delta^2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & a_0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe layers are defined by constant $y_1$. Thus, the direction \"across the layers\" is the $x_1$ direction, and the direction \"along the layers\" is the $x_2$ direction. The calculation shows that the effective conductivity across the layers ($A^{\\mathrm{hom}}_{11}$) is the harmonic mean of the microscopic conductivity, while the effective conductivity along the layers ($A^{\\mathrm{hom}}_{22}$) is the arithmetic mean. This is a classic result for layered media, analogous to resistors in series and parallel, respectively. This anisotropic effective behavior arises from an isotropic but heterogeneous micro-structure.",
