            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the total energy error introduced in a Bridging Domain Method (BDM) formulation due to an improper normalization of the blending weights. The physical system is a uniform linear elastic bar under constant axial tension. To solve this, we first establish the benchmark, which is the true strain energy of the bar. Then, we formulate the energy within the BDM-blended model and find the difference.\n\nFirst, let us define the state of the bar under the given load. The bar has a Young's modulus $E$, a cross-sectional area $A$, and is subjected to a constant axial force $F$. According to linear elasticity, the axial stress $\\sigma$ is uniform and given by:\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{F}{A} $$\nThe axial strain $\\epsilon$ is also uniform and is related to the stress by Hooke's law:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{\\sigma}{E} = \\frac{F}{EA} $$\nThe strain energy density $u$, which is the strain energy per unit volume, for a linear elastic material is:\n$$ u = \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma \\epsilon $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\sigma$ and $\\epsilon$, we obtain the strain energy density in terms of the given parameters:\n$$ u = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{F}{A}\\right) \\left(\\frac{F}{EA}\\right) = \\frac{F^2}{2EA^2} $$\nSince the bar is uniform and the loading is constant, this energy density $u$ is constant throughout the entire volume of the bar. The total true strain energy $U_{true}$ is the integral of this density over the total volume $V = A L$.\n$$ U_{true} = \\int_V u \\, dV = u \\cdot V = \\left(\\frac{F^2}{2EA^2}\\right) (A L) = \\frac{F^2 L}{2EA} $$\nThis expression represents the correct, single-model strain energy of the system.\n\nNext, we formulate the total energy within the BDM framework with the specified improper normalization. The bar is divided into regions. A portion of the bar, of length $\\ell$, is the bridging domain where atomistic (A) and continuum (C) models are blended. The remainder of the bar, of length $L-\\ell$, is modeled using a single description (e.g., continuum).\n\nThe problem states that the atomistic and continuum descriptions produce identical energy densities for this problem. This means $u_A(x) = u_C(x) = u$, where $u$ is the constant energy density derived previously.\n\nOutside the bridging domain (a region of total length $L-\\ell$), the energy density is simply $u$. The energy stored in this part of the bar, $U_{out}$, is:\n$$ U_{out} = u \\cdot A (L-\\ell) $$\nInside the bridging domain (length $\\ell$), the energy density is blended using the weights $w_A(x)$ and $w_C(x)$. The blended energy density, $u_{BDM}(x)$, is:\n$$ u_{BDM}(x) = w_A(x) u_A(x) + w_C(x) u_C(x) = (w_A(x) + w_C(x)) u $$\nWe are given that the weights are improperly normalized, such that $w_A(x) + w_C(x) = 1 + \\delta(x)$. Thus, the energy density in the bridging domain is:\n$$ u_{BDM}(x) = (1 + \\delta(x)) u $$\nThe total energy stored in the bridging domain, $U_{bridge}$, is the integral of this blended energy density over the volume of the bridging domain.

The nearest-neighbor spring stiffness is $k_1 > 0$ and the next-nearest-neighbor spring stiffness is $k_2 > 0$.

Under homogeneous strain, interior atoms experience zero net force by symmetry. We are interested in the residual \"ghost force\" at an interface where a multiscale coupling is introduced.\n\nTwo coupling strategies are considered:\n\n- Sharp-interface coupling: The atomistic domain is taken to be $\\{i \\leq 0\\}$, and the continuum domain to be $\\{i \\geq 1\\}$. The continuum energy is assumed to be the Cauchy-Born homogenization of the discrete energy. In the sharp-interface strategy, pairwise atomistic interactions are included only if both endpoints lie in the atomistic domain. Interactions that cross the interface are not included in the atomistic energy, and no corrective traction from the continuum is imposed at the interface.\n\n- Bridging domain method: An overlap region of length $L = ma$ is introduced on the continuum side with integer $m \\geq 1$.

Assume kinematic consistency in the overlap in the sense that the continuum displacement field equals the atomistic displacement field under homogeneous strain.\n\nDefine the ghost force as the net residual force acting on the interface atom $i = 0$ under the above coupling, when the chain is subjected to the homogeneous strain $u_i = \\varepsilon i a$.

The Euler-Lagrange equation for a functional depending on derivatives up to order $n$ is given by $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^k}{\\mathrm{d}x^k} \\left( \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial w^{(k)}} \\right) = 0$. In our case, $n=3$ and $F$ only depends on $w^{(3)}$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\n(-1)^3 \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^3}{\\mathrm{d}x^3} \\left( \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial w^{(3)}} \\right) = 0\n$$\nCalculating the partial derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial w^{(3)}} = 2w^{(3)}(x)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Euler-Lagrange equation yields:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^3}{\\mathrm{d}x^3} \\left( 2w^{(3)}(x) \\right) = -2w^{(6)}(x) = 0 \\implies w^{(6)}(x) = 0\n$$\nThe general solution to this sixth-order ordinary differential equation is a polynomial of degree five:\n$$\nw(x) = c_5 x^5 + c_4 x^4 + c_3 x^3 + c_2 x^2 + c_1 x + c_0\n$$\nThe six coefficients $c_0, c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5$ are determined by the six boundary conditions. First, we compute the first and second derivatives of $w(x)$:\n$$\nw'(x) = 5c_5 x^4 + 4c_4 x^3 + 3c_3 x^2 + 2c_2 x + c_1\n$$\n$$\nw''(x) = 20c_5 x^3 + 12c_4 x^2 + 6c_3 x + 2c_2\n$$\nApplying the boundary conditions at $x=0$:\n- $w(0) = 1 \\implies c_0 = 1$\n- $w'(0) = 0 \\implies c_1 = 0$\n- $w''(0) = 0 \\implies 2c_2 = 0 \\implies c_2 = 0$\n\nThus, the polynomial is of the form $w(x) = c_5 x^5 + c_4 x^4 + c_3 x^3 + 1$.\nNow, applying the boundary conditions at $x=L$:\n- $w(L) = 0 \\implies c_5 L^5 + c_4 L^4 + c_3 L^3 + 1 = 0$\n- $w'(L) = 0 \\implies 5c_5 L^4 + 4c_4 L^3 + 3c_3 L^2 = 0$\n- $w''(L) = 0 \\implies 20c_5 L^3 + 12c_4 L^2 + 6c_3 L = 0$\n\nAssuming $L \\neq 0$, we can simplify this system of three linear equations for the coefficients $c_3, c_4, c_5$:\n1. $c_5 L^5 + c_4 L^4 + c_3 L^3 = -1$\n2. $5c_5 L^2 + 4c_4 L + 3c_3 = 0$\n3. $10c_5 L^2 + 6c_4 L + 3c_3 = 0$\n\nSubtracting equation (2) from equation (3):\n$$\n(10-5)c_5 L^2 + (6-4)c_4 L + (3-3)c_3 = 0\n$$\n$$\n5c_5 L^2 + 2c_4 L = 0 \\implies 2c_4 = -5c_5 L \\implies c_4 = -\\frac{5}{2}c_5 L\n$$\nSubstitute this expression for $c_4$ into equation (2):\n$$\n5c_5 L^2 + 4\\left(-\\frac{5}{2}c_5 L\\right)L + 3c_3 = 0\n$$\n$$\n5c_5 L^2 - 10c_5 L^2 + 3c_3 = 0 \\implies -5c_5 L^2 + 3c_3 = 0 \\implies c_3 = \\frac{5}{3}c_5 L^2\n$$\nFinally, substitute the expressions for $c_3$ and $c_4$ into equation (1):\n$$\nc_5 L^5 + \\left(-\\frac{5}{2}c_5 L\\right) L^4 + \\left(\\frac{5}{3}c_5 L^2\\right) L^3 = -1\n$$\n$$\nc_5 L^5 - \\frac{5}{2}c_5 L^5 + \\frac{5}{3}c_5 L^5 = -1\n$$\n$$\nc_5 L^5 \\left(1 - \\frac{5}{2} + \\frac{5}{3}\\right) = -1\n$$\n$$\nc_5 L^5 \\left(\\frac{6 - 15 + 10}{6}\\right) = -1\n$$\n$$\nc_5 L^5 \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) = -1 \\implies c_5 = -\\frac{6}{L^5}\n$$\nNow back-substitute to find $c_4$ and $c_3$:\n$$\nc_4 = -\\frac{5}{2} \\left(-\\frac{6}{L^5}\\right) L = \\frac{15}{L^4}\n$$\n$$\nc_3 = \\frac{5}{3} \\left(-\\frac{6}{L^5}\\right) L^2 = -\\frac{10}{L^3}\n$$\nThe determined coefficients are $c_0=1$, $c_1=0$, $c_2=0$, $c_3=-10/L^3$, $c_4=15/L^4$, and $c_5=-6/L^5$.\nSubstituting these into the polynomial form for $w(x)$ gives the solution for $w_{\\mathrm{A}}(x)$:\n$$\nw_{\\mathrm{A}}(x) = 1 - \\frac{10}{L^3}x^3 + \\frac{15}{L^4}x^4 - \\frac{6}{L^5}x^5\n$$\nThis can be written more compactly using the normalized coordinate $\\xi = x/L$:\n$$\nw_{\\mathrm{A}}(x) = 1 - 10\\left(\\frac{x}{L}\\right)^3 + 15\\left(\\frac{x}{L}\\right)^4 - 6\\left(\\frac{x}{L}\\right)^5\n$$\nAs a final check, we verify the monotonicity. The first derivative is:\n$$\nw'_{\\mathrm{A}}(x) = -\\frac{30}{L^3}x^2 + \\frac{60}{L^4}x^3 - \\frac{30}{L^5}x^4 = -\\frac{30x^2}{L^5}(L^2 - 2Lx + x^2) = -\\frac{30x^2(L-x)^2}{L^5}\n$$\nFor $x \\in (0,L)$ and $L>0$, we have $x^2 > 0$, $(L-x)^2 > 0$, and $L^5 > 0$. Thus, $w'_{\\mathrm{A}}(x)  0$ for $x \\in (0,L)$. Since $w'_{\\mathrm{A}}(0)=0$ and $w'_{\\mathrm{A}}(L)=0$, the function $w_{\\mathrm{A}}(x)$ is monotonically decreasing on the interval $[0,L]$, satisfying the stated requirement.",
