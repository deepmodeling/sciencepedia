            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a stability condition for the macro-time-step $\\Delta t$ of a gap-tooth scheme applied to a one-dimensional diffusion process, $\\partial_{t} u = D \\,\\partial_{xx} u$. The scheme uses a forward Euler update for the coarse variable $U$.\n\nThe forward Euler update for the coarse variable $U$ at a given time $t$ is of the form:\n$$ U(t + \\Delta t) = U(t) + \\Delta t \\cdot \\mathcal{F}(U(t)) $$\nwhere $\\mathcal{F}(U(t))$ represents the time derivative of $U$ estimated by the microscopic solver. Since the underlying process is linear, we can analyze the stability of this numerical scheme by considering its action on a single Fourier mode of the coarse field. Let the coarse spatial variable be $X$, with the coarse grid having a spacing equal to the patch width, $\\delta$. A Fourier mode on this coarse grid can be written as $U(X,t) = \\hat{U}(k, t) e^{i k X}$, where $k$ is the coarse wavenumber.\n\nFor a diffusive process, this mode is expected to decay exponentially in time as $\\hat{U}(k, t) = \\hat{U}(k, 0) e^{-\\lambda(k) t}$, where $\\lambda(k)$ is the decay rate associated with wavenumber $k$. The time derivative is thus $\\frac{d\\hat{U}}{dt} = -\\lambda(k) \\hat{U}$. The forward Euler update for the amplitude of this mode is:\n$$ \\hat{U}(k, t + \\Delta t) = \\hat{U}(k, t) - \\Delta t \\cdot \\lambda(k) \\hat{U}(k,t) = (1 - \\Delta t \\lambda(k)) \\hat{U}(k,t) $$\nThe amplification factor for this update is $g(k) = 1 - \\Delta t \\lambda(k)$. For linear stability, we require $|g(k)| \\leq 1$ for all relevant wavenumbers $k$. Since $\\lambda(k)$ represents a physical decay rate for a passive system, it must be non-negative, $\\lambda(k) \\ge 0$. The condition $|1 - \\Delta t \\lambda(k)| \\leq 1$ is therefore equivalent to:\n$$ -1 \\leq 1 - \\Delta t \\lambda(k) \\leq 1 $$\nThe upper bound, $1 - \\Delta t \\lambda(k) \\leq 1$, implies $-\\Delta t \\lambda(k) \\leq 0$, which is always satisfied for $\\Delta t > 0$ and $\\lambda(k) \\ge 0$. The lower bound, $-1 \\leq 1 - \\Delta t \\lambda(k)$, yields the stability constraint:\n$$ \\Delta t \\lambda(k) \\leq 2 $$\nThis must hold true for all modes $k$ the scheme is designed to resolve. The most restrictive condition is imposed by the mode with the largest decay rate, $\\lambda_{\\max}$:\n$$ \\Delta t \\leq \\frac{2}{\\lambda_{\\max}} $$\nThe problem is to determine this $\\lambda_{\\max}$. We are given two crucial pieces of information.\nFirst, the problem states that \"The coarse update faithfully represents diffusive decay rates for Fourier modes up to the highest wavenumber supported by the patch geometry.\" For the continuous diffusion PDE, $\\partial_{t} u = D \\,\\partial_{xx} u$, a Fourier mode $e^{ikx}$ evolves with a decay rate $\\lambda(k) = D k^2$. The assumption of faithful representation means that the effective coarse-grained dynamics also have this dispersion relation, $\\lambda(k) = D k^2$.\n\nSecond, we must identify the \"fastest coarse-resolvable diffusive mode\". The coarse grid is composed of patches of width $\\delta$, which implies an effective grid spacing of $\\delta$. According to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, a grid with spacing $\\delta$ can resolve wavelengths down to a minimum of $2\\delta$. This corresponds to a maximum wavenumber (the Nyquist frequency) of:\n$$ k_{\\max} = \\frac{2\\pi}{2\\delta} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\delta} $$\nThis mode represents the most oscillatory pattern that can be supported by the coarse grid, where the values of $U$ alternate in sign from one patch to the next.\n\nCombining these facts, the maximum decay rate that the coarse forward Euler scheme must handle is the decay rate of the continuous PDE evaluated at the maximum resolvable wavenumber:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\max} = \\lambda(k_{\\max}) = D k_{\\max}^2 = D \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{\\delta}\\right)^2 = \\frac{D\\pi^2}{\\delta^2} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\lambda_{\\max}$ into the stability condition for the forward Euler step gives:\n$$ \\Delta t \\leq \\frac{2}{\\frac{D\\pi^2}{\\delta^2}} = \\frac{2\\delta^2}{D\\pi^2} $$\nThis result represents the coarse CFL-like stability requirement for the macro-time-step. The largest allowable time step, $\\Delta t_{\\max}$, is the upper limit of this inequality.\n\nWe can verify the consistency of this result with the statement that \"the microscopic spectrum within a patch is that of the Laplacian on an interval of length $\\delta$\". This implies Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed on the patch-level problem. The eigenfunctions of the Laplacian operator $\\partial_{xx}$ on an interval of length $\\delta$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions are $\\phi_n(x) = \\sin(n\\pi x/\\delta)$, and the corresponding eigenvalues of $-\\partial_{xx}$ are $(n\\pi/\\delta)^2$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$. The decay rates for the microscopic diffusion equation $\\partial_t u = D \\partial_{xx} u$ in the patch are $\\mu_n = D(n\\pi/\\delta)^2$. The slowest of these microscopic decay rates (the fundamental mode, $n=1$) is $\\mu_1 = D(\\pi/\\delta)^2$. The gap-tooth scheme is constructed such that the evolution of the coarse variable is governed by the slowest relaxation processes inside the patches that are consistent with the coarse data. The fastest coarse mode ($k_{\\max} = \\pi/\\delta$) excites a microscopic field profile closely resembling the fundamental eigenmode of the patch ($n=1$), confirming that the decay rate $\\lambda_{\\max}$ seen by the coarse solver is indeed $\\mu_1 = D(\\pi/\\delta)^2$.\n\nThus, the largest allowable macro time step is:\n$$ \\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{2\\delta^2}{D\\pi^2} $$\nThe units of this expression are $[\\text{length}]^2 / ([\\text{length}]^2 / [\\text{time}]) = [\\text{time}]$, which is consistent with the problem's request for an answer in seconds, assuming base SI units are used for $D$ and $\\delta$.",
