            "solution": "The problem R-f4d0f5c1 is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It is a standard problem in the field of multiscale modeling of materials that correctly applies concepts from solid-state physics and continuum mechanics. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nWe begin by establishing the relationship between the macroscopic deformation and the microscopic bond lengths. The system is a one-dimensional chain of atoms with a reference lattice spacing of $a_{0}$. Let the positions of the atoms in the reference configuration be $X_{i} = i a_{0}$ for an integer $i$. A homogeneous deformation is applied, described by the deformation gradient $F$. According to the Cauchy-Born hypothesis, the position of each atom in the deformed configuration, $x_{i}$, is given by an affine mapping of its reference position: $x_{i} = F X_{i}$.\n\nThe distance, $r$, between two adjacent atoms in the deformed configuration is then:\n$$r = x_{i+1} - x_{i} = F X_{i+1} - F X_{i} = F(X_{i+1} - X_{i})$$\nSince the distance between adjacent atoms in the reference configuration is $X_{i+1} - X_{i} = a_{0}$, the deformed bond length is:\n$$r = F a_{0}$$\n\nThe energy stored in a single bond is given by the Lennard-Jones pair potential, $\\varphi(r)$, where $r$ is the interatomic distance. Substituting the expression for the deformed bond length into the potential gives the energy per bond as a function of the deformation gradient $F$:\n$$\\varphi(F a_{0}) = 4 \\varepsilon \\left[ \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{F a_{0}} \\right)^{12} - \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{F a_{0}} \\right)^{6} \\right]$$\n\nThe problem defines the coarse-grained strain energy density, $W(F)$, as the per-bond energy scaled by the number of bonds per unit reference length. In our one-dimensional chain, there is one bond for every segment of length $a_{0}$ in the reference configuration. Therefore, the number of bonds per unit reference length is $1/a_{0}$.\n\nThe strain energy density $W(F)$ is then:\n$$W(F) = \\frac{1}{a_{0}} \\times (\\text{Energy per bond}) = \\frac{1}{a_{0}} \\varphi(F a_{0})$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\varphi(F a_{0})$, we obtain the explicit form for $W(F)$:\n$$W(F) = \\frac{4 \\varepsilon}{a_{0}} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{F a_{0}} \\right)^{12} - \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{F a_{0}} \\right)^{6} \\right]$$\n\nNext, we compute the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress, $P(F)$, which is defined as the derivative of the strain energy density with respect to the deformation gradient:\n$$P(F) = \\frac{\\partial W(F)}{\\partial F}$$\nTo facilitate the differentiation, we can rewrite $W(F)$ as:\n$$W(F) = \\frac{4 \\varepsilon}{a_{0}} \\left[ \\sigma^{12} (F a_{0})^{-12} - \\sigma^{6} (F a_{0})^{-6} \\right] = \\frac{4 \\varepsilon}{a_{0}} \\left[ \\frac{\\sigma^{12}}{a_{0}^{12}} F^{-12} - \\frac{\\sigma^{6}}{a_{0}^{6}} F^{-6} \\right]$$\nNow, we differentiate with respect to $F$:\n$$P(F) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial F} \\left( \\frac{4 \\varepsilon}{a_{0}} \\left[ \\frac{\\sigma^{12}}{a_{0}^{12}} F^{-12} - \\frac{\\sigma^{6}}{a_{0}^{6}} F^{-6} \\right] \\right)$$\n$$P(F) = \\frac{4 \\varepsilon}{a_{0}} \\left[ \\frac{\\sigma^{12}}{a_{0}^{12}} (-12 F^{-13}) - \\frac{\\sigma^{6}}{a_{0}^{6}} (-6 F^{-7}) \\right]$$\n$$P(F) = \\frac{4 \\varepsilon}{a_{0}} \\left[ -12 \\frac{\\sigma^{12}}{a_{0}^{12} F^{13}} + 6 \\frac{\\sigma^{6}}{a_{0}^{6} F^{7}} \\right]$$\nWe can simplify this expression by factoring out common terms:\n$$P(F) = \\frac{24 \\varepsilon}{a_{0}} \\left[ -2 \\frac{\\sigma^{12}}{a_{0}^{12} F^{13}} + \\frac{\\sigma^{6}}{a_{0}^{6} F^{7}} \\right]$$\nTo express this in a more compact form similar to the potential, we factor out $1/ (F a_{0})$ from the terms in the brackets but with the constants already extracted:\n$$P(F) = \\frac{24 \\varepsilon}{F a_{0}} \\left[ -2 \\frac{\\sigma^{12}}{(F a_{0})^{12}} + \\frac{\\sigma^{6}}{(F a_{0})^{6}} \\right]$$\n$$P(F) = \\frac{24 \\varepsilon}{F a_{0}} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{F a_{0}}\\right)^{6} - 2 \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{F a_{0}}\\right)^{12} \\right]$$\n\nThus, the final expressions for the strain energy density $W(F)$ and the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress $P(F)$ are:\n$$W(F) = \\frac{4 \\varepsilon}{a_{0}} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{F a_{0}} \\right)^{12} - \\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{F a_{0}} \\right)^{6} \\right]$$\n$$P(F) = \\frac{24 \\varepsilon}{F a_{0}} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{F a_{0}}\\right)^{6} - 2 \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{F a_{0}}\\right)^{12} \\right]$$",

Therefore, the term $\\frac{\\partial E_i^{\\text{approx}}}{\\partial x_0}$ will be non-zero only if the position $x_0$ is involved in the expression for $E_i^{\\text{approx}}$. This occurs when $0 \\in \\{i-2, i-1, i, i+1, i+2\\}$, which implies $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, -1, -2\\}$. We must analyze the contribution from each of these atoms.\n\nWe assume $\\lambda > 0$ and $a_0 > 0$, so for any $i>j$, the current positions satisfy $x_i > x_j$. This allows us to write $|x_i - x_j| = x_i - x_j$. The derivative of a potential term with respect to a coordinate $x_k$ is then:\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_k}\\phi(|x_i-x_j|) = \\phi'(|x_i-x_j|) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_k}(x_i-x_j) = \\phi'(x_i-x_j)(\\delta_{ik}-\\delta_{jk}) \\quad \\text{for } i>j$$\nWe now evaluate the derivatives for each relevant site energy under the uniform deformation $x_i = \\lambda i a_0$.\n\n1.  **Contribution from atom $i=0$ ($0 \\in \\mathcal{A}$)**:\n    The site energy is $E_0^{\\mathrm{site}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\Big(\\phi_1(|x_{0}-x_{-1}|) + \\phi_1(|x_{1}-x_0|)\\Big) + \\frac{1}{2}\\Big(\\phi_2(|x_0-x_{-2}|) + \\phi_2(|x_{2}-x_0|)\\Big)$.\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial E_0^{\\mathrm{site}}}{\\partial x_0} = \\frac{1}{2}\\Big(\\phi_1'(x_0-x_{-1}) \\cdot 1 + \\phi_1'(x_1-x_0) \\cdot (-1)\\Big) + \\frac{1}{2}\\Big(\\phi_2'(x_0-x_{-2}) \\cdot 1 + \\phi_2'(x_2-x_0) \\cdot (-1)\\Big)\n    $$\n    Under uniform deformation, $x_j - x_k = (j-k)\\lambda a_0$. Thus, $x_0-x_{-1} = \\lambda a_0$, $x_1-x_0 = \\lambda a_0$, $x_0-x_{-2} = 2\\lambda a_0$, and $x_2-x_0 = 2\\lambda a_0$.\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial E_0^{\\mathrm{site}}}{\\partial x_0} = \\frac{1}{2}\\Big(\\phi_1'(\\lambda a_0) - \\phi_1'(\\lambda a_0)\\Big) + \\frac{1}{2}\\Big(\\phi_2'(2\\lambda a_0) - \\phi_2'(2\\lambda a_0)\\Big) = 0.\n    $$\n\n2.  **Contribution from atom $i=-1$ ($-1 \\in \\mathcal{A}$)**:\n    The site energy is $E_{-1}^{\\mathrm{site}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\Big(\\phi_1(|x_{-1}-x_{-2}|) + \\phi_1(|x_{0}-x_{-1}|)\\Big) + \\ldots$. Only the term $\\phi_1(|x_0-x_{-1}|)$ depends on $x_0$.\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial E_{-1}^{\\mathrm{site}}}{\\partial x_0} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\phi_1(|x_0 - x_{-1}|) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\phi_1'(x_0-x_{-1}) \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\phi_1'(\\lambda a_0).\n    $$\n\n3.  **Contribution from atom $i=-2$ ($-2 \\in \\mathcal{A}$)**:\n    The site energy is $E_{-2}^{\\mathrm{site}} = \\ldots + \\frac{1}{2}\\phi_2(|x_{0}-x_{-2}|)$. Only the term $\\phi_2(|x_0-x_{-2}|)$ depends on $x_0$.\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial E_{-2}^{\\mathrm{site}}}{\\partial x_0} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\phi_2(|x_0 - x_{-2}|) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\phi_2'(x_0-x_{-2}) \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\phi_2'(2\\lambda a_0).\n    $$\n\n4.  **Contribution from atom $i=1$ ($1 \\in \\mathcal{C}$)**:\n    The site energy is $\\widetilde{E}_1^{\\mathrm{site}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\Big(\\mathbf{1}_{\\{0 \\in \\mathcal{C}\\}}\\phi_1(|x_1-x_0|) + \\phi_1(|x_2-x_1|)\\Big) + \\frac{1}{2}\\Big(\\mathbf{1}_{\\{-1 \\in \\mathcal{C}\\}}\\phi_2(|x_1-x_{-1}|) + \\phi_2(|x_3-x_1|)\\Big)$.\n    Since atom $0 \\in \\mathcal{A}$, the indicator $\\mathbf{1}_{\\{0 \\in \\mathcal{C}\\}}$ is $0$. The first term, which would depend on $x_0$, is suppressed. The term involving the NNN bond to atom $-1$ is also suppressed because $-1 \\in \\mathcal{A}$. No remaining terms in $\\widetilde{E}_1^{\\mathrm{site}}$ depend on $x_0$.\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial \\widetilde{E}_1^{\\mathrm{site}}}{\\partial x_0} = 0.\n    $$\n\n5.  **Contribution from atom $i=2$ ($2 \\in \\mathcal{C}$)**:\n    The site energy is $\\widetilde{E}_2^{\\mathrm{site}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\Big(\\mathbf{1}_{\\{1 \\in \\mathcal{C}\\}}\\phi_1(|x_2-x_1|) + \\phi_1(|x_3-x_2|)\\Big) + \\frac{1}{2}\\Big(\\mathbf{1}_{\\{0 \\in \\mathcal{C}\\}}\\phi_2(|x_2-x_0|) + \\phi_2(|x_4-x_2|)\\Big)$.\n    Since atom $0 \\in \\mathcal{A}$, the indicator $\\mathbf{1}_{\\{0 \\in \\mathcal{C}\\}}$ is $0$. The NNN bond term that connects to atom $0$ is suppressed.\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial \\widetildeE}_2^{\\mathrm{site}}}{\\partial x_0} = 0.\n    $$\n\nAll other atoms $i$ with $|i| > 2$ are too far from atom $0$ for their site energies to depend on $x_0$. Summing the non-zero contributions gives the total gradient:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E_{\\mathrm{QC}}}{\\partial x_0} = \\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\frac{\\partial E_i^{\\text{approx}}}{\\partial x_0} = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\phi_1'(\\lambda a_0) + \\frac{1}{2}\\phi_2'(2\\lambda a_0) + 0 + 0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\Big(\\phi_1'(\\lambda a_0) + \\phi_2'(2\\lambda a_0)\\Big).\n$$\nThe residual force $f_0$ is the negative of this expression:\n$$\nf_0 = -\\frac{1}{2}\\Big(\\phi_1'(\\lambda a_0) + \\phi_2'(2\\lambda a_0)\\Big).\n$$\nThis non-zero force arises because the bonds connecting atom $0$ to its neighbors in the continuum region ($i=1, 2$) are effectively given a weight of $\\frac{1}{2}$ in the total energy summation, whereas bonds connecting to neighbors in the atomistic region ($i=-1, -2$) have a weight of $1$. This imbalance breaks the force cancellation that would occur in a fully atomistic system (Newton's third law) and results in a spurious \"ghost\" force at the interface. This expression provides the explicit counterexample requested.",
