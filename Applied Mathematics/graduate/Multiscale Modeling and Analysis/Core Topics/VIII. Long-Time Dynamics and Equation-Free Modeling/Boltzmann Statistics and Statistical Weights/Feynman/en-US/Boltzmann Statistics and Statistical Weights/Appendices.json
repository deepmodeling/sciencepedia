The probability of a system being in a particular microstate is governed by the Boltzmann factor, but to be a valid probability, these values must sum to one. This practice guides you through the process of finding the normalization constant, which reveals itself to be the fundamentally important partition function $Z$. Applying this to a simple two-level system with degeneracy  solidifies the connection between microscopic energy levels, statistical weights, and macroscopic probabilities.",

            "problem": "Consider a small system with discrete microstates labeled by $i$, each having energy $E_i$, weakly coupled to a large heat reservoir at temperature $T$. In canonical equilibrium, due to the principle of equal a priori probabilities for the composite microcanonical ensemble and the constraint that the reservoir entropy is maximized subject to energy exchange, the probability $p_i$ of system microstate $i$ is proportional to the Boltzmann factor $\\exp(-\\beta E_i)$, where $\\beta$ is the inverse temperature defined by $\\beta = (k_B T)^{-1}$, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. \n\nStarting from these first principles, determine the normalization constant implied by the requirement $\\sum_i p_i = 1$ and thereby obtain the normalization function $Z(\\beta)$ for arbitrary discrete microstates.

It is based on the fundamental principles of the canonical ensemble, the Boltzmann distribution, and the definition of the partition function. All concepts, such as temperature, energy levels, degeneracy, and probability, are used in their standard scientific context. The coarse-graining into a two-level system is a standard and physically relevant model. The problem is free of scientific flaws.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined. It provides all necessary information and definitions to uniquely determine the requested quantities ($Z(\\beta)$, $p_0$, and $p_1$). The relationships between the variables are explicitly stated.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise, technical, and devoid of subjectivity or opinion.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It contains no contradictions, ambiguities, or unsound premises. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**. I will proceed with a full derivation of the solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to first find the general normalization constant for a system in canonical equilibrium and then apply this framework to a specific two-level system.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the probability $p_i$ of finding the system in a specific microstate $i$ with energy $E_i$ is proportional to the Boltzmann factor:\n$$p_i \\propto \\exp(-\\beta E_i)$$\nWe introduce a constant of proportionality, which we will call $C$, to turn this into an equality:\n$$p_i = C \\exp(-\\beta E_i)$$\nThe constant $C$ must be determined by the normalization condition, which states that the sum of probabilities over all possible microstates must equal unity:\n$$\\sum_i p_i = 1$$\nSubstituting the expression for $p_i$ into the normalization condition gives:\n$$\\sum_i C \\exp(-\\beta E_i) = 1$$\nSince the constant $C$ is independent of the microstate index $i$, it can be factored out of the summation:\n$$C \\left( \\sum_i \\exp(-\\beta E_i) \\right) = 1$$\nSolving for $C$ yields:\n$$C = \\frac{1}{\\sum_i \\exp(-\\beta E_i)}$$\nThe problem asks for the normalization function $Z(\\beta)$. This function is defined as the sum over states itself, which is the canonical partition function.\n$$Z(\\beta) = \\sum_i \\exp(-\\beta E_i)$$\nThus, the normalization constant is $C = 1/Z(\\beta)$, and the probability of any given microstate $i$ is:\n$$p_i = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta E_i)}{Z(\\beta)} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta E_i)}{\\sum_k \\exp(-\\beta E_k)}$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we consider the coarse-grained system with two energy levels. It is crucial to distinguish between microstates and energy levels. An energy level can be degenerate, meaning multiple microstates share the same energy. The partition function $Z(\\beta)$ is a sum over all *microstates*. When energies are grouped into levels, the sum can be written as a sum over energy levels, where each term is weighted by the degeneracy $g_j$ of the level $j$ with energy $E_j$.\n$$Z(\\beta) = \\sum_{\\text{levels } j} g_j \\exp(-\\beta E_j)$$\nFor the given two-level system:\n- The ground level has energy $E_0 = 0$ and degeneracy $g_0 = 1$ (as it is non-degenerate).\n- The excited level has energy $E_1 = \\epsilon$ and degeneracy $g_1$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $Z(\\beta)$:\n$$Z(\\beta) = g_0 \\exp(-\\beta E_0) + g_1 \\exp(-\\beta E_1)$$\n$$Z(\\beta) = (1) \\exp(-\\beta \\cdot 0) + g_1 \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon)$$\nSince $\\exp(0) = 1$, the partition function for this specific system is:\n$$Z(\\beta) = 1 + g_1 \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon)$$\nThis is the first quantity required for the final answer.\n\nNow, we must compute the coarse-grained level probabilities, $p_0$ and $p_1$. The probability $p_j$ of finding the system in energy level $j$ is the sum of the probabilities of all microstates $i$ that belong to that level. Since all microstates in a given level $j$ have the same energy $E_j$, the probability of each of these microstates is identical: $\\exp(-\\beta E_j) / Z(\\beta)$. To find the total probability for the level, we multiply this by the number of microstates in that level, which is the degeneracy $g_j$.\n$$p_j = g_j \\times p_i(\\text{where } E_i=E_j) = \\frac{g_j \\exp(-\\beta E_j)}{Z(\\beta)}$$\nApplying this formula to our two levels:\nFor the ground level (level $0$):\n$$p_0 = \\frac{g_0 \\exp(-\\beta E_0)}{Z(\\beta)} = \\frac{(1) \\exp(-\\beta \\cdot 0)}{1 + g_1 \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon)} = \\frac{1}{1 + g_1 \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon)}$$\nFor the excited level (level $1$):\n$$p_1 = \\frac{g_1 \\exp(-\\beta E_1)}{Z(\\beta)} = \\frac{g_1 \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon)}{1 + g_1 \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon)}$$\nAs a consistency check, the sum of these probabilities must be $1$:\n$$p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{1}{1 + g_1 \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon)} + \\frac{g_1 \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon)}{1 + g_1 \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon)} = \\frac{1 + g_1 \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon)}{1 + g_1 \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon)} = 1$$\nThe check confirms the correctness of our derived probabilities.\n\nThe final result is the row matrix $(Z(\\beta), p_0, p_1)$.\n- $Z(\\beta) = 1 + g_1 \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon)$\n- $p_0 = \\frac{1}{1 + g_1 \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon)}$\n- $p_1 = \\frac{g_1 \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon)}{1 + g_1 \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon)}$\nThese expressions are assembled into the required format for the final answer.",

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe system consists of $N$ distinguishable, noninteracting two-state spins. The energy of each spin can be either $0$ or $\\epsilon > 0$. The total energy of the system is fixed at $E$ in this microcanonical ensemble.\n\n**1. Macrostate Multiplicity $W(E)$**\n\nThe total energy is given as $E = m\\epsilon$, where $m$ is an integer between $0$ and $N$. Since each spin can contribute either $0$ or $\\epsilon$ to the total energy, a total energy of $m\\epsilon$ requires that exactly $m$ spins must be in the excited state (energy $\\epsilon$) and the remaining $N-m$ spins must be in the ground state (energy $0$).\n\nThe spins are distinguishable. Therefore, the problem of finding the number of microstates, $W(E)$, is a combinatorial one: we must count the number of distinct ways to choose which $m$ of the $N$ spins are in the excited state. This is given by the binomial coefficient \"N choose m\", denoted as $\\binom{N}{m}$.\n\nThus, the multiplicity of the macrostate with energy $E=m\\epsilon$ is:\n$$W(E) = \\binom{N}{m} = \\frac{N!}{m!(N-m)!}$$\nThis expression for $W(E)$ is in terms of $N$ and $m$.\n\n**2. Microcanonical Entropy $S(E)$**\n\nThe Boltzmann entropy $S(E)$ is defined as $S(E) = k_{B}\\ln W(E)$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.Substituting the expression for $W(E)$:\n$$S(E) = k_B \\ln \\left( \\frac{N!}{m!(N-m)!} \\right)$$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $\\ln(a/b) = \\ln(a) - \\ln(b)$ and $\\ln(ab) = \\ln(a) + \\ln(b)$, we can write the entropy as:\n$$S(E) = k_B \\left( \\ln(N!) - \\ln(m!) - \\ln((N-m)!) \\right)$$\nThis is the exact expression for the entropy in terms of $N$ and $m$.\n\n**3. Asymptotic Expression for $S(E)$**\n\nWe are asked to consider the thermodynamic limit, where $N$ is large. We are also given that the excitation fraction $x = E/(N\\epsilon)$ is fixed, with $0 < x < 1$. From the problem definitions, we have $E = m\\epsilon$, which implies $m = E/\\epsilon$. Substituting this into the definition of $x$:\n$$x = \\frac{E}{N\\epsilon} = \\frac{m\\epsilon}{N\\epsilon} = \\frac{m}{N}$$\nThis means $m = Nx$. Consequently, $N-m = N - Nx = N(1-x)$. Since $N$ is large and $0 < x < 1$, both $m$ and $N-m$ are also large numbers. We can therefore apply Stirling's approximation, $\\ln(n!) \\approx n\\ln(n) - n$ for large $n$, to all three factorial terms in the entropy expression.\n\nApplying the approximation to $S(E)/k_B$:\n$$\\frac{S(E)}{k_B} \\approx [N\\ln(N) - N] - [m\\ln(m) - m] - [(N-m)\\ln(N-m) - (N-m)]$$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$\\frac{S(E)}{k_B} \\approx N\\ln(N) - N - m\\ln(m) + m - (N-m)\\ln(N-m) + (N-m)$$\nThe linear terms in $N$ and $m$ cancel out: $-N + m + (N-m) = -N + m + N - m = 0$.\n$$\\frac{S(E)}{k_B} \\approx N\\ln(N) - m\\ln(m) - (N-m)\\ln(N-m)$$\nNow, we substitute $m=Nx$ and $N-m = N(1-x)$:\n$$\\frac{S(E)}{k_B} \\approx N\\ln(N) - (Nx)\\ln(Nx) - N(1-x)\\ln(N(1-x))$$\nUsing the logarithm rule $\\ln(ab)=\\ln(a)+\\ln(b)$:\n$$\\frac{S(E)}{k_B} \\approx N\\ln(N) - Nx[\\ln(N)+\\ln(x)] - N(1-x)[\\ln(N)+\\ln(1-x)]$$\nDistributing the terms:\n$$\\frac{S(E)}{k_B} \\approx N\\ln(N) - Nx\\ln(N) - Nx\\ln(x) - [N\\ln(N) + N\\ln(1-x) - Nx\\ln(N) - Nx\\ln(1-x)]$$\n$$\\frac{S(E)}{k_B} \\approx N\\ln(N) - Nx\\ln(N) - Nx\\ln(x) - N\\ln(N) - N\\ln(1-x) + Nx\\ln(N) + Nx\\ln(1-x)$$\nThe terms involving $\\ln(N)$ cancel: $(N\\ln(N) - N\\ln(N)) + (-Nx\\ln(N) + Nx\\ln(N)) = 0$. We are left with:\n$$\\frac{S(E)}{k_B} \\approx -Nx\\ln(x) - N\\ln(1-x) + Nx\\ln(1-x)$$\nFactoring out $-N$:\n$$\\frac{S(E)}{k_B} \\approx -N[x\\ln(x) + \\ln(1-x) - x\\ln(1-x)] = -N[x\\ln(x) + (1-x)\\ln(1-x)]$$\nSo, the entropy is:\n$$S(E) \\approx -Nk_B [x\\ln(x) + (1-x)\\ln(1-x)]$$\nThe final step is to express this result in terms of the given variables $E$, $N$, and $\\epsilon$. We substitute $x = E/(N\\epsilon)$ and $1-x = 1 - E/(N\\epsilon) = (N\\epsilon - E)/(N\\epsilon)$:\n$$S(E) \\approx -Nk_B \\left[ \\frac{E}{N\\epsilon} \\ln\\left(\\frac{E}{N\\epsilon}\\right) + \\left(1 - \\frac{E}{N\\epsilon}\\right) \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{E}{N\\epsilon}\\right) \\right]$$\nThis is the required leading-order asymptotic expression for the entropy.\n\n**4. Realized Macrostate**\n\nThe problem asks to identify the realized macrostate, specified by the value of $m$, in the microcanonical ensemble at a fixed energy $E$. By definition, the microcanonical ensemble describes an isolated system with a fixed number of particles $N$, a fixed volume $V$ (implicit here), and a fixed total energy $E$. The macrostate of this system is defined by these fixed macroscopic parameters, in this case $(N, E)$.\nThe relationship between $E$ and $m$ is given as a direct proportionality, $E=m\\epsilon$. For a given fixed energy $E$, the number of excited spins $m$ is therefore also fixed:\n$$m = \\frac{E}{\\epsilon}$$\nIn the microcanonical ensemble, there is no fluctuation in $m$ because there is no fluctuation in $E$. The system is \"stuck\" in the macrostate defined by $E$, and all $\\binom{N}{m}$ microstates corresponding to this energy are, by the fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics, equally probable. Thus, the realized value of $m$ is determined directly by the energy constraint of the ensemble.",
