The phases are linearly elastic and isotropic, characterized by bulk modulus $K$ and shear modulus $G$, with the stress-strain relation written as $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = 3 K \\, \\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) \\boldsymbol{I} + 2 G \\, \\text{dev}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ is the strain tensor, $\\boldsymbol{I}$ is the identity tensor, $\\text{tr}(\\cdot)$ denotes the trace, and $\\text{dev}(\\cdot)$ denotes the deviatoric part.

It models the composite by considering a representative grain of each phase embedded in a homogeneous medium whose conductivity is the effective conductivity $\\sigma_{\\text{eff}}$ itself. The self-consistency condition requires that the volume-averaged induced dipole moment over all grains vanishes.

Maxwell-Garnett (MG) Estimate**\n\nThe MG model is asymmetric, assuming one phase (inclusions) is embedded in another (matrix). Here, we take phase $2$ as the matrix. The formula is:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{MG}} = \\sigma_2 \\frac{\\sigma_1 + 2\\sigma_2 + 2f_1(\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2)}{\\sigma_1 + 2\\sigma_2 - f_1(\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2)} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{MG}} = 0.01 \\frac{10 + 2(0.01) + 2(0.25)(10 - 0.01)}{10 + 2(0.01) - 0.25(10 - 0.01)} = 0.01 \\frac{10.02 + 0.5(9.99)}{10.02 - 0.25(9.99)} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{MG}} = 0.01 \\frac{10.02 + 4.995}{10.02 - 2.4975} = 0.01 \\frac{15.015}{7.5225} \\approx 0.01 \\times 1.995945 \\approx 0.01996 \\, \\text{S/m} $$\n\n**3.

The MG model assumes a microstructure where the conductive phase ($\\sigma_1$) is entirely disconnected, limiting conduction pathways. The Bruggeman model, due to its symmetric and self-consistent nature, implicitly accounts for a more random and potentially interconnected microstructure, leading to a higher effective conductivity than the most restrictive MG case. The value is still much closer to the lower bound than the upper bound, which is reasonable because the volume fraction of the conductive phase ($f_1=0.25$) is below the percolation threshold (~$0.33$), meaning continuous pathways of phase $1$ are statistically unlikely.\n\nThe final answer requested is the Bruggeman estimate, rounded to four significant figures.\n$\\sigma_{\\text{eff}} \\approx 0.03898 \\, \\text{S/m}$.",
