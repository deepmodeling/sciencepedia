It describes an exponential cohesive zone model, a standard and widely used constitutive law in computational fracture mechanics to model material failure and delamination. The definitions of fracture energy ($G_{c}$) and tangent stiffness ($k_{t}$) are fundamental to this field.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed.

A unique, meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and standard scientific terminology. It is free of ambiguity and subjective claims.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information and definitions to proceed with the required derivations and analysis. There are no contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution will be provided.\n\nThe first task is to evaluate the fracture energy, $G_{c}$, defined as the total work of separation per unit area. Starting from the provided definition:\n$$\nG_{c} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t(\\delta)\\, \\mathrm{d}\\delta\n$$\nWe substitute the given exponential traction-separation law, $t(\\delta) = \\sigma_{c}\\,\\exp(-\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{c}})$:\n$$\nG_{c} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\sigma_{c}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{c}}\\right)\\, \\mathrm{d}\\delta\n$$\nThe parameter $\\sigma_{c}$ is a constant with respect to the integration variable $\\delta$, so it can be moved outside the integral:\n$$\nG_{c} = \\sigma_{c} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{c}}\\right)\\, \\mathrm{d}\\delta\n$$\nWe now evaluate the improper integral. The antiderivative of $\\exp(-a\\delta)$ with respect to $\\delta$ is $-\\frac{1}{a}\\exp(-a\\delta)$. In our case, the constant $a = \\frac{1}{\\delta_{c}}$. Therefore, the evaluation proceeds as follows:\n$$\nG_{c} = \\sigma_{c} \\left[ -\\delta_{c} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{c}}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty}\n$$\nWe evaluate the expression at the limits of integration, $\\delta \\to \\infty$ and $\\delta = 0$:\n$$\nG_{c} = \\sigma_{c} \\left( \\lim_{\\delta \\to \\infty} \\left[ -\\delta_{c} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{c}}\\right) \\right] - \\left[ -\\delta_{c} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0}{\\delta_{c}}\\right) \\right] \\right)\n$$\nAs $\\delta \\to \\infty$, the term $\\exp(-\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{c}})$ approaches $0$. At $\\delta = 0$, the term $\\exp(0)$ is equal to $1$.\n$$\nG_{c} = \\sigma_{c} \\left( 0 - (-\\delta_{c} \\cdot 1) \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the fracture energy:\n$$\nG_{c} = \\sigma_{c} \\delta_{c}\n$$\nNext, we determine the initial consistent tangent stiffness, $k_{t}(0)$. The stiffness is defined as the derivative of traction with respect to separation:\n$$\nk_{t}(\\delta) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}t}{\\mathrm{d}\\delta} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\delta} \\left[ \\sigma_{c}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{c}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nApplying the chain rule for differentiation, we obtain:\n$$\nk_{t}(\\delta) = \\sigma_{c} \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{c}}\\right) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\delta_{c}}\\right) = -\\frac{\\sigma_{c}}{\\delta_{c}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{c}}\\right)\n$$\nTo find the initial stiffness, we evaluate this expression at $\\delta = 0$:\n$$\nk_{t}(0) = -\\frac{\\sigma_{c}}{\\delta_{c}} \\exp(0) = -\\frac{\\sigma_{c}}{\\delta_{c}}\n$$\nFinally, we explain the physical roles of the parameters $\\sigma_{c}$ and $\\delta_{c}$.\nThe parameter $\\sigma_{c}$ represents the cohesive strength of the interface. This is evident by evaluating the traction at zero separation, $t(0) = \\sigma_{c}\\exp(0) = \\sigma_{c}$. Since $\\exp(-\\delta/\\delta_{c}) \\le 1$ for all $\\delta \\ge 0$, $t(0)$ is the maximum traction the interface can sustain. Thus, $\\sigma_{c}$ dictates the peak stress required to initiate failure. Its role is to set the magnitude of the force-like quantity in the work-conjugate pair $(t, \\delta)$.\n\nThe parameter $\\delta_{c}$ is a characteristic length scale that governs the softening behavior of the interface. It dictates how rapidly the traction decreases as the separation $\\delta$ increases. A smaller $\\delta_{c}$ corresponds to a more rapid decay of traction and thus a more brittle failure mode, which is also reflected in a more negative initial stiffness $k_{t}(0) = -\\sigma_c/\\delta_c$. A larger $\\delta_{c}$ implies a slower decay, representing a more ductile or gradual failure process.\n\nFrom the first principle of work, energy is the integral of a force-like quantity over a displacement-like quantity. Here, the fracture energy per unit area, $G_{c}$, has units of $(\\text{Force}/\\text{Area})\\times\\text{Length}$, which is Energy/Area. The derived result $G_{c} = \\sigma_{c} \\delta_{c}$ demonstrates this relationship directly. The fracture energy—a measure of material toughness—is the product of the material strength ($\\sigma_{c}$) and its characteristic failure length scale ($\\delta_{c}$). This cohesive model framework serves as an energy regularization scheme for the stress singularity predicted by linear elastic fracture mechanics, replacing the singularity with a physically motivated failure process defined by a finite strength $\\sigma_{c}$ acting over a finite separation range characterized by $\\delta_{c}$. This ensures the energy dissipated is finite and equal to $G_c$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation, analysis, and implementation of a return-mapping algorithm for a rate-independent, associative cohesive zone model (CZM). The derivation will be established from the provided first principles, and its equivalence to a classical radial return algorithm in plasticity will be demonstrated.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Cohesive Update Algorithm**\n\nThe governing equations for the cohesive model are provided. We consider a discrete time step from time $t_n$ to $t_{n+1}$. The state variables $(\\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1}, \\boldsymbol{q}_{n+1})$ and the integrated plastic multiplier $\\Delta \\lambda$ are to be determined, given the state at step $n$ (specifically $\\boldsymbol{q}_n$) and the prescribed separation at step $n+1$, $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{n+1}$.\n\nThe evolution of the internal variable $\\boldsymbol{q}$ is governed by the flow rule $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{q}} = \\lambda \\, \\partial f / \\partial \\boldsymbol{t}$. We employ an implicit backward Euler time integration scheme, which is standard for rate-independent problems due to its unconditional stability. The discretized flow rule is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{q}_{n+1} - \\boldsymbol{q}_n = \\Delta \\lambda \\, \\left. \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{t}} \\right|_{n+1}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta\\lambda = \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} \\lambda(t') dt'$. For the given yield function $f(\\boldsymbol{t}) = \\lVert \\boldsymbol{t} \\rVert - \\sigma_c$, the gradient is $\\partial f / \\partial \\boldsymbol{t} = \\boldsymbol{t} / \\lVert \\boldsymbol{t} \\rVert$. The system of equations to be solved at step $n+1$ consists of the discrete KKT conditions:\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1} = k(\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{n+1} - \\boldsymbol{q}_{n+1}) \\quad \\text{(Constitutive Law)} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{q}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{q}_n + \\Delta \\lambda \\frac{\\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1}}{\\lVert \\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1} \\rVert} \\quad \\text{(Flow Rule)} \\\\\nf(\\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1}) = \\lVert \\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1} \\rVert - \\sigma_c \\le 0 \\quad \\text{(Admissibility)} \\\\\n\\Delta \\lambda \\ge 0 \\quad \\text{(Irreversibility)} \\\\\n\\Delta \\lambda \\, f(\\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1}) = 0 \\quad \\text{(Complementarity)}\n\\end{align}\n$$\nThis system is solved using an elastic predictor-corrector scheme.\n\n**Elastic Predictor Step:**\nWe first assume the step is purely elastic, which corresponds to no evolution of the internal variable, i.e., $\\Delta \\lambda = 0$. This leads to a trial state.\nThe trial internal variable is frozen: $\\boldsymbol{q}^{\\text{tr}} = \\boldsymbol{q}_n$.\nThe trial traction, $\\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}}$, is then computed using the constitutive law:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}} = k(\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{n+1} - \\boldsymbol{q}_n)\n$$\nWe then check if this trial traction lies within or on the boundary of the elastic domain by evaluating the yield function:\n$$\nf^{\\text{tr}} = f(\\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}}) = \\lVert \\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}} \\rVert - \\sigma_c\n$$\n\n**Case A: Elastic Update**\nIf $f^{\\text{tr}} \\le 0$, the trial state is admissible. The elastic assumption holds, and no correction is needed. The updated state is the trial state:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{q}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{q}_n \\\\\n\\Delta \\lambda = 0\n$$\nThese values satisfy all the KKT conditions.\n\n**Case B: Inelastic Corrector Step**\nIf $f^{\\text{tr}}  0$, the trial state is inadmissible and violates the yield condition. The elastic assumption is incorrect, implying that inelastic slip must occur, so $\\Delta \\lambda  0$. The complementarity condition $\\Delta \\lambda f(\\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1}) = 0$ then dictates that the final state must lie on the yield surface, i.e., $f(\\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1}) = 0$. This is the consistency condition:\n$$\n\\lVert \\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1} \\rVert = \\sigma_c\n$$\nTo find the corrected state, we substitute the flow rule into the constitutive law:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1} = k \\left( \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{n+1} - \\left( \\boldsymbol{q}_n + \\Delta \\lambda \\frac{\\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1}}{\\lVert \\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1} \\rVert} \\right) \\right)\n$$\nRearranging and identifying the trial traction $\\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}} = k(\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{n+1} - \\boldsymbol{q}_n)$ and using the consistency condition $\\lVert \\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1} \\rVert = \\sigma_c$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}} - k \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\sigma_c} \\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1}\n$$\nSolving for $\\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1} \\left( 1 + \\frac{k \\Delta \\lambda}{\\sigma_c} \\right) = \\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}} \\implies \\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{1 + k \\Delta \\lambda / \\sigma_c} \\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}}\n$$\nThis equation reveals a crucial property: the updated traction vector $\\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1}$ is colinear with the trial traction vector $\\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}}$. This means they share the same unit direction vector:\n$$\n\\frac{\\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1}}{\\lVert \\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1} \\rVert} = \\frac{\\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}}}{\\lVert \\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}} \\rVert}\n$$\nWe can now solve for the unknown $\\Delta \\lambda$ by taking the Euclidean norm of the expression for $\\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1}$:\n$$\n\\lVert \\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1} \\rVert = \\frac{1}{1 + k \\Delta \\lambda / \\sigma_c} \\lVert \\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}} \\rVert\n$$\nSubstituting $\\lVert \\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1} \\rVert = \\sigma_c$:\n$$\n\\sigma_c = \\frac{\\lVert \\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}} \\rVert}{1 + k \\Delta \\lambda / \\sigma_c}\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $\\Delta \\lambda$:\n$$\n1 + \\frac{k \\Delta \\lambda}{\\sigma_c} = \\frac{\\lVert \\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}} \\rVert}{\\sigma_c} \\implies \\frac{k \\Delta \\lambda}{\\sigma_c} = \\frac{\\lVert \\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}} \\rVert - \\sigma_c}{\\sigma_c}\n$$\nThis yields the closed-form expression for the consistency parameter:\n$$\n\\Delta \\lambda = \\frac{\\lVert \\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}} \\rVert - \\sigma_c}{k} = \\frac{f^{\\text{tr}}}{k}\n$$\nSince this case corresponds to $f^{\\text{tr}}  0$, we have $\\Delta \\lambda  0$, consistent with the KKT conditions.\n\nWith $\\Delta \\lambda$ determined, the final updated state variables are:\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1} = \\sigma_c \\frac{\\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}}}{\\lVert \\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}} \\rVert} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{q}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{q}_n + \\Delta \\lambda \\frac{\\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1}}{\\lVert \\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1} \\rVert} = \\boldsymbol{q}_n + \\Delta \\lambda \\frac{\\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}}}{\\lVert \\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}} \\rVert} \\\\\n= \\boldsymbol{q}_n + \\frac{\\lVert \\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}} \\rVert - \\sigma_c}{k} \\frac{\\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}}}{\\lVert \\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}} \\rVert}\n\\end{align}\n$$\nThe update for $\\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1}$ is a projection of $\\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}}$ back onto the yield surface along the radial direction, hence the name \"radial return\".\n\n**2. Equivalence to Plasticity's Radial Return Algorithm**\n\nThe problem asks to demonstrate that this algorithm is mathematically identical to the classical radial return method for a simple vector-valued, elastic-perfectly plastic model. Let's establish the analogy by mapping the variables:\n- Cohesive traction $\\boldsymbol{t} \\leftrightarrow$ Stress-like vector $\\boldsymbol{s}$\n- Cohesive separation $\\boldsymbol{\\delta} \\leftrightarrow$ Strain-like vector $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$\n- Cohesive internal variable $\\boldsymbol{q} \\leftrightarrow$ Plastic strain-like vector $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p$\n- Penalty stiffness $k \\leftrightarrow$ Elastic modulus $E$\n- Cohesive strength $\\sigma_c \\leftrightarrow$ Yield strength $\\sigma_Y$\n\nThe equations for the plasticity model are:\n- Additive strain decomposition: $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^e + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p$\n- Linear elastic law: $\\boldsymbol{s} = E \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^e = E(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} - \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p)$\n- Yield function: $g(\\boldsymbol{s}) = \\lVert \\boldsymbol{s} \\rVert - \\sigma_Y \\le 0$\n- Associative flow rule: $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}^p = \\dot{\\gamma} \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{s}} = \\dot{\\gamma} \\frac{\\boldsymbol{s}}{\\lVert \\boldsymbol{s} \\rVert}$\n- KKT conditions: $\\dot{\\gamma} \\ge 0$, $g(\\boldsymbol{s}) \\le 0$, $\\dot{\\gamma} g(\\boldsymbol{s}) = 0$\n\nFollowing the exact same derivation logic (backward Euler discretization, elastic predictor, plastic corrector):\n- Trial stress: $\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{tr}} = E(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{n+1} - \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p_n)$\n- Trial yield value: $g^{\\text{tr}} = \\lVert \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{tr}} \\rVert - \\sigma_Y$\n- If $g^{\\text{tr}}  0$, the plastic correction yields:\n  - Plastic consistency parameter: $\\Delta \\gamma = \\frac{\\lVert \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{tr}} \\rVert - \\sigma_Y}{E}$\n  - Updated stress: $\\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1} = \\sigma_Y \\frac{\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{tr}}}{\\lVert \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{tr}} \\rVert}$\n  - Updated plastic strain: $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p_n + \\Delta \\gamma \\frac{\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{tr}}}{\\lVert \\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{tr}} \\rVert}$\n\nBy direct comparison and applying the variable mappings, the equations for the cohesive model update $(\\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1}, \\boldsymbol{q}_{n+1}, \\Delta \\lambda)$ are formally identical to those for the plasticity update $(\\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1}, \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p_{n+1}, \\Delta \\gamma)$. The derivation explicitly confirms this equivalence.\n\n**3. Summary of the Numerical Algorithm**\n\nFor a given test case with parameters $(k, \\sigma_c)$ and state $(\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{n+1}, \\boldsymbol{q}_n)$, the update is computed as follows:\n1.  Compute the trial traction: $\\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}} = k(\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{n+1} - \\boldsymbol{q}_n)$.\n2.  Compute the norm of the trial traction: $\\lVert \\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}} \\rVert$.\n3.  If $\\lVert \\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}} \\rVert \\le \\sigma_c$:\n    -  The step is elastic.\n    -  $\\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}}$.\n    -  $\\boldsymbol{q}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{q}_n$.\n    -  $\\Delta \\lambda = 0$.\n4.  If $\\lVert \\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}} \\rVert  \\sigma_c$:\n    -  The step is inelastic.\n    -  Compute the increment of the multiplier: $\\Delta \\lambda = (\\lVert \\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}} \\rVert - \\sigma_c) / k$.\n    -  Compute the updated traction via radial return: $\\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1} = \\sigma_c \\frac{\\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}}}{\\lVert \\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}} \\rVert}$.\n    -  Compute the updated internal variable: $\\boldsymbol{q}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{q}_n + \\Delta \\lambda \\frac{\\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}}}{\\lVert \\boldsymbol{t}^{\\text{tr}} \\rVert}$.\n5.  Return $(\\boldsymbol{t}_{n+1}, \\boldsymbol{q}_{n+1}, \\Delta \\lambda)$.\n\nThis algorithm will be implemented to run the specified test cases and verify the formal equivalence demonstrated above.",
