The final answer must be the expression for $G_{c}$ only.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Groundedness**: The problem is scientifically sound. It describes an exponential cohesive zone model, a standard and widely used constitutive law in computational fracture mechanics to model material failure and delamination. The definitions of fracture energy ($G_{c}$) and tangent stiffness ($k_{t}$) are fundamental to this field.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. The functional form of $t(\\delta)$ is well-defined, and the integral for $G_{c}$ is convergent. The derivative for $k_{t}$ is also well-defined. A unique, meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and standard scientific terminology. It is free of ambiguity and subjective claims.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information and definitions to proceed with the required derivations and analysis. There are no contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution will be provided.\n\nThe first task is to evaluate the fracture energy, $G_{c}$, defined as the total work of separation per unit area. Starting from the provided definition:\n$$\nG_{c} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t(\\delta)\\, \\mathrm{d}\\delta\n$$\nWe substitute the given exponential traction-separation law, $t(\\delta) = \\sigma_{c}\\,\\exp(-\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{c}})$:\n$$\nG_{c} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\sigma_{c}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{c}}\\right)\\, \\mathrm{d}\\delta\n$$\nThe parameter $\\sigma_{c}$ is a constant with respect to the integration variable $\\delta$, so it can be moved outside the integral:\n$$\nG_{c} = \\sigma_{c} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{c}}\\right)\\, \\mathrm{d}\\delta\n$$\nWe now evaluate the improper integral. The antiderivative of $\\exp(-a\\delta)$ with respect to $\\delta$ is $-\\frac{1}{a}\\exp(-a\\delta)$. In our case, the constant $a = \\frac{1}{\\delta_{c}}$. Therefore, the evaluation proceeds as follows:\n$$\nG_{c} = \\sigma_{c} \\left[ -\\delta_{c} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{c}}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty}\n$$\nWe evaluate the expression at the limits of integration, $\\delta \\to \\infty$ and $\\delta = 0$:\n$$\nG_{c} = \\sigma_{c} \\left( \\lim_{\\delta \\to \\infty} \\left[ -\\delta_{c} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{c}}\\right) \\right] - \\left[ -\\delta_{c} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0}{\\delta_{c}}\\right) \\right] \\right)\n$$\nAs $\\delta \\to \\infty$, the term $\\exp(-\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{c}})$ approaches $0$. At $\\delta = 0$, the term $\\exp(0)$ is equal to $1$.\n$$\nG_{c} = \\sigma_{c} \\left( 0 - (-\\delta_{c} \\cdot 1) \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the fracture energy:\n$$\nG_{c} = \\sigma_{c} \\delta_{c}\n$$\nNext, we determine the initial consistent tangent stiffness, $k_{t}(0)$. The stiffness is defined as the derivative of traction with respect to separation:\n$$\nk_{t}(\\delta) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}t}{\\mathrm{d}\\delta} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\delta} \\left[ \\sigma_{c}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{c}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nApplying the chain rule for differentiation, we obtain:\n$$\nk_{t}(\\delta) = \\sigma_{c} \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{c}}\\right) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\delta_{c}}\\right) = -\\frac{\\sigma_{c}}{\\delta_{c}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{c}}\\right)\n$$\nTo find the initial stiffness, we evaluate this expression at $\\delta = 0$:\n$$\nk_{t}(0) = -\\frac{\\sigma_{c}}{\\delta_{c}} \\exp(0) = -\\frac{\\sigma_{c}}{\\delta_{c}}\n$$\nFinally, we explain the physical roles of the parameters $\\sigma_{c}$ and $\\delta_{c}$.\nThe parameter $\\sigma_{c}$ represents the cohesive strength of the interface. This is evident by evaluating the traction at zero separation, $t(0) = \\sigma_{c}\\exp(0) = \\sigma_{c}$. Since $\\exp(-\\delta/\\delta_{c}) \\le 1$ for all $\\delta \\ge 0$, $t(0)$ is the maximum traction the interface can sustain. Thus, $\\sigma_{c}$ dictates the peak stress required to initiate failure. Its role is to set the magnitude of the force-like quantity in the work-conjugate pair $(t, \\delta)$.\n\nThe parameter $\\delta_{c}$ is a characteristic length scale that governs the softening behavior of the interface. It dictates how rapidly the traction decreases as the separation $\\delta$ increases. A smaller $\\delta_{c}$ corresponds to a more rapid decay of traction and thus a more brittle failure mode, which is also reflected in a more negative initial stiffness $k_{t}(0) = -\\sigma_c/\\delta_c$. A larger $\\delta_{c}$ implies a slower decay, representing a more ductile or gradual failure process.\n\nFrom the first principle of work, energy is the integral of a force-like quantity over a displacement-like quantity. Here, the fracture energy per unit area, $G_{c}$, has units of $(\\text{Force}/\\text{Area})\\times\\text{Length}$, which is Energy/Area. The derived result $G_{c} = \\sigma_{c} \\delta_{c}$ demonstrates this relationship directly. The fracture energy—a measure of material toughness—is the product of the material strength ($\\sigma_{c}$) and its characteristic failure length scale ($\\delta_{c}$). This cohesive model framework serves as an energy regularization scheme for the stress singularity predicted by linear elastic fracture mechanics, replacing the singularity with a physically motivated failure process defined by a finite strength $\\sigma_{c}$ acting over a finite separation range characterized by $\\delta_{c}$. This ensures the energy dissipated is finite and equal to $G_c$.",

            "solution": "The user's problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of solid mechanics, specifically Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and cohesive zone models. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters, boundary conditions, and a clear objective for both the analytical derivation and the numerical verification. The premises are factually sound, and the language is objective and unambiguous. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe solution is structured in two main parts. First, we derive the analytical compliance, $C_{\\mathrm{anal}}$, for the idealized case of an infinitely stiff bond. Second, we formulate and implement a numerical model based on the finite element method to compute the compliance, $C_{\\mathrm{num}}(K_0)$, for a finite cohesive stiffness $K_0$, and then quantify the relative error.\n\n### Part 1: Analytical Compliance ($C_{\\mathrm{anal}}$) for an Infinitely Stiff Bond\n\nThe problem considers a symmetric Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) specimen. Due to symmetry, we can analyze\na single arm—for instance, the top arm—and infer the behavior of the full system. The total applied load is $P_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, with a force of magnitude $P_{\\mathrm{arm}} = P_{\\mathrm{tot}}/2$ acting upwards on the top arm at the position $x=0$.\n\nThe analytical compliance, $C_{\\mathrm{anal}}$, corresponds to the case where the cohesive interface is infinitely stiff ($K_0 \\to \\infty$). In this limit, the bonded region of the beam, spanning from $x=a$ to $x=L$, is perfectly rigid and cannot deform. This means the uncracked ligament behaves as a rigid foundation. Consequently, the cracked portion of the beam, from $x=0$ to $x=a$, acts as a perfect cantilever beam of length $a$, fixed (clamped) at $x=a$.\n\nWe derive the tip displacement of this cantilever from first principles using Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. The governing equation for the beam's moment-curvature relationship is:\n$$E I \\frac{d^2 w(x)}{dx^2} = M(x)$$\nwhere $E$ is Young's modulus, $I$ is the second moment of area of the beam's cross-section, $w(x)$ is the transverse displacement, and $M(x)$ is the internal bending moment. For the top arm, subjected to an upward force $P_{\\mathrm{arm}}$ at $x=0$ and clamped at $x=a$, the internal moment at a position $x \\in [0, a]$ is given by:\n$$M(x) = -P_{\\mathrm{arm}}(a-x)$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the moment causes the beam to bend with a negative curvature (concave down), which is inconsistent with an upward force. A consistent convention with $w$ positive upwards requires $M(x)$ to be positive to produce positive curvature. The reaction moment at the clamp $x=a$ is $M_a = -P_{\\mathrm{arm}} a$. The moment at a section $x$ is then $M(x) = M_a + P_{\\mathrm{arm}}(a-x) = -P_{\\mathrm{arm}} a + P_{\\mathrm{arm}} a - P_{\\mathrm{arm}} x = -P_{\\mathrm{arm}} x$. This also yields negative moment.\nLet's use the standard result, whose derivation is unambiguous. The end deflection of a cantilever beam of length $L_c$ under a point load $P_c$ is $w_{\\text{end}} = P_c L_c^3 / (3EI)$.\n\nFor our case, the cantilever length is $L_c = a$ and the load is $P_c = P_{\\mathrm{arm}} = P_{\\mathrm{tot}}/2$. The displacement of the top arm at the loaded end ($x=0$) is therefore:\n$$w_{\\mathrm{top}}(0) = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{arm}} a^3}{3EI} = \\frac{(P_{\\mathrm{tot}}/2) a^3}{3EI} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{tot}} a^3}{6EI}$$\nBy symmetry, the bottom arm deflects downwards by the same amount:\n$$w_{\\mathrm{bottom}}(0) = -\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{tot}} a^3}{6EI}$$\nThe total opening displacement at the end of the specimen, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{end}}$, is the difference between the top and bottom arm displacements:\n$$\\delta_{\\mathrm{end}} = w_{\\mathrm{top}}(0) - w_{\\mathrm{bottom}}(0) = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{tot}} a^3}{6EI} - \\left(-\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{tot}} a^3}{6EI}\\right) = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{tot}} a^3}{3EI}$$\nCompliance, $C$, is defined as the total opening displacement divided by the total applied load. The analytical compliance is thus:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{anal}} = \\frac{\\delta_{\\mathrm{end}}}{P_{\\mathrm{tot}}} = \\frac{a^3}{3EI}$$\nSubstituting the expression for the second moment of area of a rectangular cross-section, $I = b h^3 / 12$, we get:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{anal}} = \\frac{a^3}{3E (b h^3 / 12)} = \\frac{4 a^3}{E b h^3}$$\nThis expression will serve as the reference value.\n\n### Part 2: Numerical Model for Finite Cohesive Stiffness ($K_0$)\n\nWe model one of the arms (the top one) as a one-dimensional Euler-Bernoulli beam using the finite element method. The beam of total length $L$ is discretized into $N$ elements of equal length $\\Delta x = L/N$. This creates a mesh of $N+1$ nodes, located at positions $x_i = i \\Delta x$ for $i=0, 1, \\dots, N$. Each node $i$ has two degrees of freedom (DOFs): a transverse displacement $w_i$ and a rotation $\\theta_i$. The entire system is described by a vector of nodal DOFs $\\mathbf{U} = [w_0, \\theta_0, w_1, \\theta_1, \\dots, w_N, \\theta_N]^T$.\n\nThe element stiffness matrix, $\\mathbf{k}_e$, for a standard Euler-Bernoulli beam element of length $\\ell$ connecting two nodes is given by:\n$$\\mathbf{k}_e = \\frac{EI}{\\ell^3} \\begin{pmatrix}\n12 & 6\\ell & -12 & 6\\ell \\\\\n6\\ell & 4\\ell^2 & -6\\ell & 2\\ell^2 \\\\\n-12 & -6\\ell & 12 & -6\\ell \\\\\n6\\ell & 2\\ell^2 & -6\\ell & 4\\ell^2\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe global stiffness matrix, $\\mathbf{K}$, is assembled by summing the contributions from all $N$ element matrices at their corresponding global DOF locations.\n\nThe cohesive interaction in the bonded region $[a, L]$ is modeled by discrete springs. The traction is $t_n = K_0 \\delta_n$, where the opening is $\\delta_n = w_{\\mathrm{top}} - w_{\\mathrm{bottom}}$. By symmetry, $w_{\\mathrm{bottom}} = -w_{\\mathrm{top}}$, so $\\delta_n = 2w_{\\mathrm{top}}$. The resisting line force (force per unit length) on the top beam is $q_{\\mathrm{res}}(x) = t_n(x) \\cdot b = K_0 (2w_{\\mathrm{top}}(x)) b$. This is equivalent to an elastic foundation with stiffness per unit length $k_f = 2 K_0 b$.\nThe problem specifies approximating this distributed load by nodal springs. The nodal spring stiffness is given as $k_{\\mathrm{node}} = K_0 b \\Delta x$. This stiffness connects the top and bottom beams. The force on the top beam at node $i$ due to this spring is $F_{i, \\mathrm{top}} = -k_{\\mathrm{node}} (w_{i, \\mathrm{top}} - w_{i, \\mathrm{bottom}}) = -k_{\\mathrm{node}} (w_{i, \\mathrm{top}} - (-w_{i, \\mathrm{top}})) = -2 k_{\\mathrm{node}} w_{i, \\mathrm{top}}$. This corresponds to an effective stiffness-to-ground for the top beam of $k_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 2 k_{\\mathrm{node}} = 2 K_0 b \\Delta x$.\nThis stiffness is added to the diagonal entries of the global stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ corresponding to the transverse displacement DOFs ($w_i$) for all nodes located in the bonded region. The first node in the bonded region is at index $i_{\\mathrm{start}} = \\lceil a / \\Delta x \\rceil$. We add $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ to the diagonal entries $\\mathbf{K}[2i, 2i]$ for all $i \\in [i_{\\mathrm{start}}, N]$.\n\nThe external load is a point force $P_{\\mathrm{arm}} = P_{\\mathrm{tot}}/2$ at $x=0$ (node $0$). This is represented by setting the first entry of the global force vector $\\mathbf{F}$ to $P_{\\mathrm{arm}}$.\nThe boundary conditions are a clamp at the far end, $x=L$ (node $N$), meaning zero displacement and zero rotation: $w_N = 0$ and $\\theta_N = 0$. These are enforced by modifying the linear system of equations.\n\nAfter assembling $\\mathbf{K}$ and $\\mathbf{F}$ and applying boundary conditions, we solve the static equilibrium equation $\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{U} = \\mathbf{F}$ for the nodal DOF vector $\\mathbf{U}$. The displacement of the top arm at the loaded end is $w_{\\mathrm{top}}(0) = \\mathbf{U}[0]$.\n\nThe numerical compliance $C_{\\mathrm{num}}(K_0)$ is then computed as:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{num}}(K_0) = \\frac{\\delta_{\\mathrm{end}}}{P_{\\mathrm{tot}}} = \\frac{2 w_{\\mathrm{top}}(0)}{P_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$$\n\n### Part 3: Relative Error Calculation\n\nFinally, for each given value of $K_0$, we quantify the discrepancy between the numerical result (with finite cohesive stiffness) and the idealized analytical solution by computing the relative error, $e(K_0)$:\n$$e(K_0) = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{num}}(K_0) - C_{\\mathrm{anal}}}{C_{\\mathrm{anal}}}$$\nAs $K_0$ increases, the bonded region becomes stiffer, and the numerical model should converge to the analytical idealization. Therefore, we expect $e(K_0) \\to 0$ as $K_0 \\to \\infty$. For $K_0=0$, the system is a cantilever of length $L$ fixed at $x=L$, and the error will be significant, specifically $e(0) = (L/a)^3 - 1$.\n\nThe provided Python code implements this entire procedure.",
