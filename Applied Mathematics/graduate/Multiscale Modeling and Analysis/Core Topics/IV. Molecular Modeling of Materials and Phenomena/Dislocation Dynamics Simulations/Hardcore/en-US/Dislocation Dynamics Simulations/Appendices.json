            "solution": "The problem is to determine the Peach–Koehler force per unit length on a straight screw dislocation in a specified stress field. The solution involves applying the Peach–Koehler formula, which defines the force density $\\mathbf{f}$ (force per unit length) on a dislocation with line sense vector $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ and Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$ subjected to a Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$.\n\nThe Peach–Koehler formula is given by:\n$$ \\mathbf{f} = (\\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) \\times \\boldsymbol{\\xi} $$\nIn index notation, using the Einstein summation convention, this is expressed as:\n$$ f_i = \\epsilon_{ijk} (b_m \\sigma_{mj}) \\xi_k $$\nWe will use the direct vector formalism, which is more straightforward for this problem.\n\nFirst, we must define the relevant vectors and the tensor from the given problem statement. The coordinate system is a right-handed orthonormal basis $\\{\\hat{x}, \\hat{y}, \\hat{z}\\}$.\n\nThe dislocation line is oriented along the Cartesian axis $\\hat{z}$. We choose the line sense vector $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ to be parallel to this axis.\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\xi} = \\hat{z} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe Burgers vector is given as $\\mathbf{b} = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{nm}\\,\\hat{z}$. Let $b = |\\mathbf{b}| = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 0.25 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$ \\mathbf{b} = b\\,\\hat{z} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSince the Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is parallel to the line sense vector $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$, this confirms the dislocation is of pure screw character.\n\nThe applied Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is given as spatially uniform. The only specified non-zero component is the shear stress $\\sigma_{xz} = 150\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$. Since the Cauchy stress tensor is symmetric, we must have $\\sigma_{zx} = \\sigma_{xz}$. All other components are stated to be zero, including $\\sigma_{yz}=0$. The stress tensor in matrix form is therefore:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{xx}  \\sigma_{xy}  \\sigma_{xz} \\\\ \\sigma_{yx}  \\sigma_{yy}  \\sigma_{yz} \\\\ \\sigma_{zx}  \\sigma_{zy}  \\sigma_{zz} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  \\sigma_{xz} \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ \\sigma_{xz}  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nwhere $\\sigma_{xz} = 150\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 150 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2}$.\n\nThe first step in calculating the force is to compute the vector resulting from the operation $(\\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma})$. This is a vector-tensor product where the vector $\\mathbf{b}$ (as a row vector) acts on the tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ from the left. Let us call the resulting vector $\\mathbf{v}$.\n$$ \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} $$\nIn component form, $v_j = b_i \\sigma_{ij}$.\n$$ \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} b_x  b_y  b_z \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{xx}  \\sigma_{xy}  \\sigma_{xz} \\\\ \\sigma_{yx}  \\sigma_{yy}  \\sigma_{yz} \\\\ \\sigma_{zx}  \\sigma_{zy}  \\sigma_{zz} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSubstituting the components of $\\mathbf{b}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  b \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  \\sigma_{xz} \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ \\sigma_{xz}  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nPerforming the matrix multiplication:\n$$ v_x = (0)(0) + (0)(0) + (b)(\\sigma_{xz}) = b \\sigma_{xz} $$\n$$ v_y = (0)(0) + (0)(0) + (b)(0) = 0 $$\n$$ v_z = (0)(\\sigma_{xz}) + (0)(0) + (b)(0) = 0 $$\nSo, the vector $\\mathbf{v}$ is:\n$$ \\mathbf{v} = b \\sigma_{xz} \\hat{x} $$\n\nNow, we compute the Peach–Koehler force density $\\mathbf{f}$ by taking the cross product of $\\mathbf{v}$ and the line sense vector $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$.\n$$ \\mathbf{f} = \\mathbf{v} \\times \\boldsymbol{\\xi} = (b \\sigma_{xz} \\hat{x}) \\times (\\hat{z}) $$\nUsing the property of the cross product for a right-handed basis, $\\hat{x} \\times \\hat{z} = -\\hat{y}$.\n$$ \\mathbf{f} = b \\sigma_{xz} (\\hat{x} \\times \\hat{z}) = b \\sigma_{xz} (-\\hat{y}) = -b \\sigma_{xz} \\hat{y} $$\nThis is the expression for the force density on the dislocation line segment. The direction of the force is along the negative $y$-axis ($-\\hat{y}$).\n\nFor a screw dislocation, the glide plane is any plane containing the line direction. The force vector $\\mathbf{f}$ lies in the plane perpendicular to the dislocation line and drives the motion of the line. The direction of this force, $-\\hat{y}$, is therefore the direction of dislocation glide. The dislocation line moves in the direction of the force, so the implied glide direction is along the negative $y$-axis. The plane of glide is the one containing both the line direction ($\\hat{z}$) and the velocity direction ($-\\hat{y}$), which is the $yz$-plane.\n\nThe problem asks for the signed $y$-component of the Peach–Koehler force per unit length, which we denote as $f_y$. From the vector expression $\\mathbf{f} = -b \\sigma_{xz} \\hat{y}$, we can directly identify this component:\n$$ f_y = -b \\sigma_{xz} $$\nThe negative sign indicates the force component is directed along the negative $y$-axis, consistent with the convention that the positive direction is along $+\\hat{y}$.\n\nFinally, we substitute the numerical values to compute the result.\nThe magnitude of the Burgers vector is $b = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 0.25 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe shear stress is $\\sigma_{xz} = 150\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 150 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2}$.\n$$ f_y = - (0.25 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\times (150 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2}) $$\n$$ f_y = - (0.25 \\times 150) \\times 10^{-9+6}\\,\\mathrm{N/m} $$\n$$ f_y = -37.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{N/m} $$\n$$ f_y = -0.0375\\,\\mathrm{N/m} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The number $-0.0375$ has exactly three significant figures ($3$, $7$, and $5$). Thus, no further rounding is needed. The final numerical value for the signed $y$-component of the force per unit length is $-0.0375\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$.",

            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is determined to be sound, well-posed, and scientifically grounded. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nPart (a): Derivation of the shear flow stress increment $\\Delta \\tau$.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in establishing a force balance on a mobile dislocation segment as it interacts with pinning points from the forest dislocation network. The external driving force, provided by the resolved shear stress, is balanced by the internal restoring force, which arises from the dislocation's line tension.\n\nThe driving force per unit length on a dislocation is the Peach-Koehler force. Its magnitude is given by $f_K = \\tau b$, where $\\tau$ is the resolved shear stress and $b$ is the magnitude of the Burgers vector. The stress component responsible for overcoming the forest obstacles is the flow stress increment, which we denote as $\\Delta \\tau$. Thus, the driving force per unit length is:\n$$f_{K} = \\Delta \\tau b$$\n\nThe restoring force arises from the dislocation's line tension, $T$. A curved dislocation line of radius $R$ experiences a restoring force per unit length, $f_T$, directed towards the center of curvature. This force is given by:\n$$f_T = \\frac{T}{R}$$\n\nAt the critical condition for the dislocation to break away from its pinning points and glide forward, the driving force must equal the maximum restoring force. This occurs when the dislocation bows out to its minimum possible radius of curvature just before unpinning. The force balance equation is:\n$$f_K = f_T$$\n$$\\Delta \\tau b = \\frac{T}{R}$$\n\nWe are given approximations for the line tension $T$ and the critical radius $R$. The line tension of a dislocation is proportional to the shear modulus $\\mu$ and the square of the Burgers vector, $b^2$. We can write this as:\n$$T \\propto \\mu b^2$$\nThe problem states this relation is $T \\sim \\kappa \\mu b^2$, where $\\kappa$ is a dimensionless constant.\n\nThe critical radius of curvature $R$ is related to the average spacing $\\ell$ between the pinning points. For a segment of length $\\ell$ that bows out into a semicircular arc, the radius is $R = \\ell/2$. The problem states the relation is $R \\sim \\ell/2$.\n\nSubstituting these proportionalities into the force balance equation:\n$$\\Delta \\tau b \\propto \\frac{\\mu b^2}{\\ell}$$\n\nSolving for the stress increment $\\Delta \\tau$:\n$$\\Delta \\tau \\propto \\frac{\\mu b}{\\ell}$$\n\nFinally, the spacing $\\ell$ between forest dislocations is inversely related to the square root of the total dislocation density, $\\rho$. This is because the area per dislocation is $1/\\rho$, so the linear spacing scales as the square root of this area. The relation is given as $\\ell \\sim 1/\\sqrt{\\rho}$, or:\n$$\\ell \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\rho}}$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $\\ell$ into our equation for $\\Delta \\tau$:\n$$\\Delta \\tau \\propto \\mu b \\left( \\frac{1}{1/\\sqrt{\\rho}} \\right)$$\n$$\\Delta \\tau \\propto \\mu b \\sqrt{\\rho}$$\n\nThe problem requires us to consolidate all the dimensionless constants of proportionality from these relationships (arising from geometry, logarithmic corrections to line tension, etc.) into a single prefactor $\\alpha$.
