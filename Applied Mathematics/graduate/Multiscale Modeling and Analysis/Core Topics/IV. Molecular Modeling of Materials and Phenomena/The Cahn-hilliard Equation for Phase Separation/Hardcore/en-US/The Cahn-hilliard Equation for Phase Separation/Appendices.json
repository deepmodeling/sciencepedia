            "solution": "The problem asks for the equilibrium conditions of a binary mixture described by the Cahn-Hilliard framework and to apply these conditions to a specific double-well free-energy density to find the coexisting phase compositions and their common tangent line.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement. The givens are: the Cahn-Hilliard free-energy functional $\\mathcal{F}[c] = \\int_{\\Omega} [W(c) + \\frac{\\kappa}{2}|\\nabla c|^{2}]\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}$, the governing PDE $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot ( M \\,\\nabla \\mu )$ with chemical potential $\\mu = \\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{F}}{\\delta c}$, the mass conservation constraint $\\frac{1}{|\\Omega|}\\int_{\\Omega} c(\\mathbf{x},t)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x} = c_{0}$, and a specific bulk energy density $W(c) = \\frac{1}{4}(c^{2}-1)^{2}$. The problem is scientifically grounded in the established theory of phase separation, is well-posed, and is stated objectively. All information required for a solution is provided. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nWe seek the state of thermodynamic equilibrium, which corresponds to the global minimum of the free-energy functional $\\mathcal{F}[c]$ subject to the constraint of mass conservation. The problem specifies the large-domain limit, where interfacial contributions are considered negligible. In this limit, the system consists of large domains of two homogeneous phases with compositions $c_{-}$ and $c_{+}$. Within these homogeneous domains, $\\nabla c = 0$, so the term $\\frac{\\kappa}{2}|\\nabla c|^{2}$ is zero. The contribution from the thin interfacial regions where $\\nabla c \\neq 0$ is assumed to be insignificant compared to the total bulk energy. The functional to be minimized thus simplifies to the total bulk energy:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}[c] \\approx \\int_{\\Omega} W(c(\\mathbf{x})) \\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}.\n$$\nLet the volume fractions of the two phases be $\\alpha$ and $1-\\alpha$, corresponding to compositions $c_{-}$ and $c_{+}$, respectively. The total volume of the domain is $|\\Omega|$. The volume occupied by phase $c_{-}$ is $\\alpha|\\Omega|$ and by phase $c_{+}$ is $(1-\\alpha)|\\Omega|$. The total free energy is the sum of the energies of the two bulk phases:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F} = W(c_{-}) (\\alpha |\\Omega|) + W(c_{+}) ((1-\\alpha) |\\Omega|).\n$$\nThe average free-energy density is $\\bar{F} = \\mathcal{F}/|\\Omega| = \\alpha W(c_{-}) + (1-\\alpha) W(c_{+})$.\n\nThe mass conservation constraint states that the average composition is fixed at $c_0$:\n$$\nc_0 = \\frac{1}{|\\Omega|} \\int_{\\Omega} c(\\mathbf{x}) \\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x} = \\frac{1}{|\\Omega|} \\left( c_{-} (\\alpha |\\Omega|) + c_{+} ((1-\\alpha) |\\Omega|) \\right) = \\alpha c_{-} + (1-\\alpha) c_{+}.\n$$\nFor a system with two-phase coexistence, we must have $c_{-}  c_0  c_{+}$. We can express the volume fraction $\\alpha$ in terms of the compositions:\n$$\nc_0 = \\alpha c_{-} + c_{+} - \\alpha c_{+} \\implies \\alpha (c_{-} - c_{+}) = c_0 - c_{+} \\implies \\alpha = \\frac{c_0 - c_{+}}{c_{-} - c_{+}} = \\frac{c_{+} - c_0}{c_{+} - c_{-}}.\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the average free-energy density $\\bar{F}$:\n$$\n\\bar{F}(c_{-}, c_{+}) = \\frac{c_{+} - c_0}{c_{+} - c_{-}} W(c_{-}) + \\left(1 - \\frac{c_{+} - c_0}{c_{+} - c_{-}}\\right) W(c_{+}) = \\frac{c_{+} - c_0}{c_{+} - c_{-}} W(c_{-}) + \\frac{c_0 - c_{-}}{c_{+} - c_{-}} W(c_{+}).\n$$\nThis expression can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\bar{F} = W(c_{-}) + (c_0 - c_{-}) \\frac{W(c_{+}) - W(c_{-})}{c_{+} - c_{-}}.\n$$\nTo find the equilibrium compositions $c_{-}$ and $c_{+}$, we must minimize $\\bar{F}$ with respect to $c_{-}$ and $c_{+}$ for a fixed $c_0$. Geometrically, the expression for $\\bar{F}$ represents the value at $c=c_0$ on the straight line segment connecting the points $(c_{-}, W(c_{-}))$ and $(c_{+}, W(c_{+}))$. To minimize $\\bar{F}$ for any $c_0$ in the coexistence region, this line segment must be as low as possible. This occurs when the line is tangent to the curve $W(c)$ at both $c=c_{-}$ and $c=c_{+}$. This is the \"common tangent construction\".\n\nLet the equation of the common tangent line be $L(c) = mc + b$. The conditions for this line to be tangent to $W(c)$ at $c_{-}$ and $c_{+}$ are:\n1. The line passes through the points $(c_{-}, W(c_{-}))$ and $(c_{+}, W(c_{+}))$:\n   $$W(c_{-}) = m c_{-} + b$$\n   $$W(c_{+}) = m c_{+} + b$$\n2. The slope of the line equals the slope of the curve at the points of tangency:\n   $$m = W'(c_{-})$$\n   $$m = W'(c_{+})$$\nHere, $W'(c)$ denotes $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}W}{\\mathrm{d}c}$. From these conditions, we derive the fundamental equations for coexisting phases:\n$$\nW'(c_{-}) = W'(c_{+})\n$$\nand by subtracting the first two equations,\n$$\nW(c_{+}) - W(c_{-}) = m(c_{+} - c_{-}) = W'(c_{+})(c_{+} - c_{-}).\n$$\nThis can be written as $W'(c_{+}) = \\frac{W(c_{+}) - W(c_{-})}{c_{+} - c_{-}}$, which simply states that the slope of the tangent at $c_{+}$ is equal to the slope of the chord connecting the two points.\n\nNow we apply these general conditions to the specific bulk free-energy density:\n$$\nW(c) = \\frac{1}{4}(c^{2}-1)^{2} = \\frac{1}{4}(c^{4} - 2c^{2} + 1).\n$$\nThe derivative is:\n$$\nW'(c) = \\frac{1}{4}(4c^{3} - 4c) = c^{3} - c.\n$$\nThe first equilibrium condition is $W'(c_{-}) = W'(c_{+})$:\n$$\nc_{-}^{3} - c_{-} = c_{+}^{3} - c_{+} \\implies c_{+}^{3} - c_{-}^{3} - (c_{+} - c_{-}) = 0.\n$$\nFactoring this expression, we get:\n$$\n(c_{+} - c_{-})(c_{+}^{2} + c_{+}c_{-} + c_{-}^{2}) - (c_{+} - c_{-}) = 0.\n$$\nSince we are seeking two distinct phases, $c_{+} \\neq c_{-}$, we can divide by $(c_{+} - c_{-})$:\n$$\nc_{+}^{2} + c_{+}c_{-} + c_{-}^{2} - 1 = 0.\n$$\nThe potential $W(c)$ is an even function of $c$, i.e., $W(c) = W(-c)$. The derivative $W'(c)$ is an odd function, $W'(-c) = -W'(c)$. The common tangent for a symmetric potential connects symmetric points. We thus hypothesize that the solution is of the form $c_{-} = -c_{+}$. Substituting this into the condition $W'(c_{-}) = W'(c_{+})$ gives:\n$$\nW'(-c_{+}) = W'(c_{+}) \\implies -W'(c_{+}) = W'(c_{+}) \\implies 2W'(c_{+}) = 0 \\implies W'(c_{+}) = 0.\n$$\nThis means the points of tangency must be the locations of the minima of the free-energy density $W(c)$. We find the extrema by solving $W'(c) = c^{3}-c = c(c-1)(c+1) = 0$. The roots are $c=0$, $c=1$, and $c=-1$. The points $c=-1$ and $c=1$ correspond to the two wells (minima) of the potential, as $W''(c)=3c^2-1$ is positive at these points ($W''(\\pm 1)=2$).\nThus, the equilibrium phase compositions are:\n$$\nc_{-} = -1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c_{+} = 1.\n$$\nThis solution is valid for any average composition $c_0 \\in (-1, 1)$.\n\nNow we determine the parameters of the common tangent line $L(c)=mc+b$.\nThe slope $m$ is given by the derivative at the tangent points:\n$$\nm = W'(c_{+}) = W'(1) = 1^{3} - 1 = 0.\n$$\nAs a check, $m = W'(c_{-}) = W'(-1) = (-1)^{3} - (-1) = -1 + 1 = 0$.\nThe y-intercept $b$ is found using one of the tangency points, for example, $(c_{+}, W(c_{+}))$.\nFirst, we compute the value of the potential at the minima:\n$$\nW(c_{+}) = W(1) = \\frac{1}{4}(1^{2}-1)^{2} = 0.\n$$\nThen, using $W(c_{+}) = m c_{+} + b$:\n$$\n0 = (0)(1) + b \\implies b = 0.\n$$\nThe common tangent line is $L(c) = 0$, which is the c-axis. The equilibrium compositions are $c_{-} = -1$ and $c_{+} = 1$, the slope of the common tangent is $m=0$, and its intercept is $b=0$.\n\nThe requested quantities are the slope $m$, intercept $b$, and the ordered pair of compositions $(c_{-}, c_{+})$.\nThe slope is $m=0$.\nThe intercept is $b=0$.\nThe ordered pair of equilibrium compositions is $(c_{-}, c_{+}) = (-1, 1)$.",

The term on the left is the variational derivative of the free energy, $\\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{F}}{\\delta c}$, which is the definition of the (generalized) chemical potential. The Euler-Lagrange equation thus states that the chemical potential must be constant throughout the system at equilibrium, which is a fundamental thermodynamic principle.\n\nNext, we determine the value of the constant $\\mu$. The system is in equilibrium between two bulk phases where $c \\to -1$ and $c \\to 1$. In these bulk regions, far from the interface, the composition is uniform, so all its spatial derivatives are zero: $\\partial_x c \\to 0$ and $\\partial_{xx} c \\to 0$. The Euler–Lagrange equation in the bulk reduces to $W'(c_{bulk}) - \\mu = 0$.\nThe potential is $W(c) = \\frac{1}{4}(c^4 - 2c^2 + 1)$, so its derivative is $W'(c) = c^3 - c$.\nFor the bulk phases, $c_{bulk} = \\pm 1$.

Rearranging the terms to group the unknown $c^{n+1}$ on the left-hand side gives:\n$$\nc^{n+1} + \\Delta t M \\kappa \\nabla^{4} c^{n+1} = c^{n} + \\Delta t M \\nabla^{2} (W'(c^n))\n$$\nUsing the identity operator $I$, this can be written in a more formal operator form:\n$$\n\\left(I + \\Delta t M \\kappa \\nabla^{4}\\right) c^{n+1} = c^{n} + \\Delta t M \\nabla^{2} (W'(c^n))\n$$\n\nSecond, we establish the mass conservation property of this discrete scheme. The total mass at time level $n$ is $Q^n = \\int_{\\Omega} c^n \\,\\mathrm{d}x$. We need to show that $Q^{n+1} = \\int_{\\Omega} c^{n+1} \\,\\mathrm{d}x$ is equal to $Q^n$. We integrate the discrete update equation over the periodic domain $\\Omega$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} (c^{n+1} - c^{n}) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\Delta t \\int_{\\Omega} \\left( M \\nabla^{2} (W'(c^n)) - M \\kappa \\nabla^{4} c^{n+1} \\right) \\,\\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nThe left side is $Q^{n+1} - Q^n$. We analyze the integrals on the right-hand side. Both integrands are of the form of a Laplacian or bi-Laplacian of a function. By the Divergence Theorem, for any sufficiently smooth vector field $\\boldsymbol{F}$, $\\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{F} \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\boldsymbol{F} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} \\,\\mathrm{d}S$. For a periodic domain, the surface integrals over opposite boundaries cancel, so $\\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\boldsymbol{F} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} \\,\\mathrm{d}S = 0$ for any periodic $\\boldsymbol{F}$.\nThe first integral is $\\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla^{2} (W'(c^n)) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla (W'(c^n))) \\,\\mathrm{d}x$. Since $c^n$ is periodic, $W'(c^n)$ and its gradient $\\nabla (W'(c^n))$ are also periodic. Therefore, this integral is zero.\nThe second integral is $\\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla^{4} c^{n+1} \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla^2(\\nabla^2 c^{n+1}) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla (\\nabla^2 c^{n+1})) \\,\\mathrm{d}x$. Assuming $c^{n+1}$ and its derivatives are periodic, the vector field $\\nabla (\\nabla^2 c^{n+1})$ is periodic, and the integral vanishes.\nThus, the right-hand side of the integrated equation is zero:\n$$\nQ^{n+1} - Q^n = \\Delta t (M \\cdot 0 - M\\kappa \\cdot 0) = 0\n$$\nThis confirms that $Q^{n+1} = Q^n$, so the numerical scheme is mass-conserving. This desirable property is a direct consequence of the conservative ($H^{-1}$ gradient flow) structure of the Cahn-Hilliard equation.\n\nThird, we determine the Fourier multiplier $m(\\boldsymbol{k};\\Delta t, M, \\kappa)$. The rearranged update equation is:\n$$\n\\left(I + \\Delta t M \\kappa \\nabla^{4}\\right) c^{n+1} = c^{n} + \\Delta t M \\nabla^{2} (W'(c^n))\n$$\nWe apply the Fourier transform, $\\mathcal{F}$, to this equation. Let $\\widehat{f}(\\boldsymbol{k})$ denote the Fourier transform of a function $f(x)$ at wavevector $\\boldsymbol{k}$. The key properties of the Fourier transform for derivatives are $\\mathcal{F}[\\nabla^{2} f](\\boldsymbol{k}) = -|\\boldsymbol{k}|^2 \\widehat{f}(\\boldsymbol{k})$ and $\\mathcal{F}[\\nabla^{4} f](\\boldsymbol{k}) = |\\boldsymbol{k}|^4 \\widehat{f}(\\boldsymbol{k})$. Applying the transform to the entire equation yields:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}\\left[\\left(I + \\Delta t M \\kappa \\nabla^{4}\\right) c^{n+1}\\right](\\boldsymbol{k}) = \\mathcal{F}\\left[c^{n} + \\Delta t M \\nabla^{2} (W'(c^n))\\right](\\boldsymbol{k})\n$$\nUsing the linearity of the Fourier transform and its properties for derivatives, we get:\n$$\n\\left(1 + \\Delta t M \\kappa |\\boldsymbol{k}|^4\\right) \\widehat{c}^{n+1}(\\boldsymbol{k}) = \\widehat{c}^{n}(\\boldsymbol{k}) + \\Delta t M (-|\\boldsymbol{k}|^2) \\widehat{W'(c^n)}(\\boldsymbol{k})\n$$\nThe problem states that the semi-implicit step involves applying the inverse of a linear operator, and this action is diagonal in Fourier space with a scalar multiplier $m$. Solving for $\\widehat{c}^{n+1}(\\boldsymbol{k})$ isolates this multiplier:\n$$\n\\widehat{c}^{n+1}(\\boldsymbol{k}) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\Delta t M \\kappa |\\boldsymbol{k}|^4} \\left( \\widehat{c}^{n}(\\boldsymbol{k}) - \\Delta t M |\\boldsymbol{k}|^2 \\widehat{W'(c^n)}(\\boldsymbol{k}) \\right)\n$$\nThe linear operator being inverted is $L = I + \\Delta t M \\kappa \\nabla^{4}$. Its action in Fourier space is multiplication by the factor $(1 + \\Delta t M \\kappa |\\boldsymbol{k}|^4)$. The action of the inverse operator $L^{-1}$ is therefore multiplication by the reciprocal of this factor. This reciprocal is the requested Fourier multiplier $m(\\boldsymbol{k};\\Delta t, M, \\kappa)$.\n\nThus, the closed-form expression for the Fourier multiplier is:\n$$\nm(\\boldsymbol{k};\\Delta t, M, \\kappa) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\Delta t M \\kappa |\\boldsymbol{k}|^4}\n$$",
            "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{1 + \\Delta t M \\kappa |\\boldsymbol{k}|^4}}$$"
