The derivation will proceed from the fundamental definitions provided for the stationary probability distributions.\n\nThe unbiased stationary probability density along the collective variable $s$, denoted as $P_0(s)$, is governed by the Boltzmann distribution. It is proportional to the exponential of the negative free energy $F(s)$ scaled by the thermal energy $k_B T$. Let $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\nThe probability density can be written as:\n$$\nP_0(s) = C_0 \\exp(-\\beta F(s))\n$$\nwhere $C_0$ is a normalization constant.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the relationship between the free energy surface $F(s)$ and the converged Well-Tempered Metadynamics (WTMetaD) bias potential $V_b(s)$, and the calculation of specific parameters for a given system. The derivation will be based on the foundational principles of biased statistical mechanical ensembles and WTMetaD, as provided in the problem statement.\n\nThe first principle states that the stationary probability distribution of the collective variable $s$ under the influence of both the intrinsic free energy $F(s)$ and the applied bias $V_b(s)$ is given by:\n$$P_b(s) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\beta[F(s) + V_b(s)]\\right)$$\nwhere $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature of the system. We can write this with an explicit normalization constant $C_1$:\n$$P_b(s) = C_1 \\exp\\left(-\\beta F(s) - \\beta V_b(s)\\right)$$\n\nThe second principle describes the condition for the quasi-stationary state in WTMetaD, achieved in the infinite-time limit. It states that the effective sampling rate is uniform across the space of the collective variable $s$. This is mathematically expressed as the product of the biased probability $P_b(s)$ and a tempering factor being constant:\n$$P_b(s) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{V_b(s)}{k_B \\Delta T}\\right) = C_2$$\nwhere $\\Delta T$ is the bias temperature and $C_2$ is a constant. From this expression, we can isolate $P_b(s)$:\n$$P_b(s) = C_2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_b(s)}{k_B \\Delta T}\\right)$$\n\nWe now have two expressions for the same stationary distribution $P_b(s)$. Equating them yields:\n$$C_1 \\exp\\left(-\\beta F(s) - \\beta V_b(s)\\right) = C_2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_b(s)}{k_B \\Delta T}\\right)$$\nTo solve for $F(s)$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln(C_1) - \\beta F(s) - \\beta V_b(s) = \\ln(C_2) + \\frac{V_b(s)}{k_B \\Delta T}$$\nNext, we rearrange the terms to isolate $\\beta F(s)$:\n$$-\\beta F(s) = \\beta V_b(s) + \\frac{V_b(s)}{k_B \\Delta T} + \\ln(C_2) - \\ln(C_1)$$\nWe can factor out $V_b(s)$ from the first two terms on the right-hand side and combine the logarithmic terms into a single constant, $C' = \\ln(C_2) - \\ln(C_1)$:\n$$-\\beta F(s) = V_b(s)\\left(\\beta + \\frac{1}{k_B \\Delta T}\\right) + C'$$\nSolving for $F(s)$ by dividing by $-\\beta$:\n$$F(s) = -\\frac{1}{\\beta} V_b(s)\\left(\\beta + \\frac{1}{k_B \\Delta T}\\right) - \\frac{C'}{\\beta}$$\nLetting $C_{add} = -C'/\\beta$ be the new additive constant, we simplify the term in the parenthesis:\n$$F(s) = -V_b(s)\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\beta k_B \\Delta T}\\right) + C_{add}$$\nSubstituting the definition $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$:\n$$F(s) = -V_b(s)\\left(1 + \\frac{k_B T}{k_B \\Delta T}\\right) + C_{add} = -V_b(s)\\left(1 + \\frac{T}{\\Delta T}\\right) + C_{add}$$\nThis is the sought-after relationship between $F(s)$ and $V_b(s)$. The problem asks for this relationship to be expressed in terms of the bias factor $\\gamma$, defined as $\\gamma = (T + \\Delta T)/T$. Let us manipulate the scaling term:\n$$1 + \\frac{T}{\\Delta T} = \\frac{\\Delta T + T}{\\Delta T}$$\nFrom the definition of $\\gamma$, we have $T + \\Delta T = \\gamma T$ and $\\Delta T = \\gamma T - T = T(\\gamma-1)$. Substituting these into the scaling term gives:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta T + T}{\\Delta T} = \\frac{\\gamma T}{T(\\gamma-1)} = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}$$\nThus, the final relation between the free energy and the converged bias potential is:\n$$F(s) = -\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}V_b(s) + C_{add}$$\nThis equation shows that the free energy surface $F(s)$ is linearly proportional to the converged WTMetaD bias potential $V_b(s)$, up to an additive constant.\n\nThe problem defines a scaling factor $c$ such that $F(s) = c\\,V_b(s)$ up to an additive constant.
