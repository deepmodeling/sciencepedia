By demanding that the action $S$ remains a dimensionless quantity, we can assign a 'canonical mass dimension' to every parameter, a concept explored in this exercise .

In the framework of the Renormalization Group (RG), define the canonical mass dimension $[\\mathcal{O}]$ of an operator $\\mathcal{O}$ by requiring that the action $S$ be dimensionless in units where $\\hbar=1$, and by assigning the momentum dimension $[\\partial_{\\mu}]=1$ and the coordinate dimension $[x^{\\mu}]=-1$. Starting from these first principles, determine the canonical mass dimensions $[\\phi]$, $[r]$, and $[u]$ in general $d$.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is a standard, self-contained problem in theoretical physics that is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We can proceed with a formal solution.\n\nOur objective is to determine the canonical mass dimensions of the scalar field $\\phi$, the parameter $r$, and the coupling constant $u$ for the given theory in a $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. The entire analysis proceeds from the fundamental requirement that the action, $S$, must be a dimensionless quantity in natural units where $\\hbar=1$. In these units, mass, energy, and inverse length all have the same dimension. We denote the mass dimension of a quantity $\\mathcal{O}$ as $[\\mathcal{O}]$.\n\nThe problem provides the following definitions and constraints:\n1. The action $S = \\int d^d x\\, \\mathcal{L}$ is dimensionless: $[S] = 0$.\n2. The Lagrangian density is $\\mathcal{L}=\\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi)(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi)+\\frac{1}{2} r\\, \\phi^2+\\frac{u}{4!}\\,\\phi^4$.\n3. The mass dimension of a spacetime coordinate is $[x^{\\mu}] = -1$.\n4. The mass dimension of the derivative operator is $[\\partial_{\\mu}] = 1$. This is consistent with $[\\partial_\\mu] = -[x^\\mu]$.\n\nFirst, we determine the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$. The dimension of the action is given by the sum of the dimensions of the integration measure and the Lagrangian density:\n$$[S] = [\\int d^d x] + [\\mathcal{L}]$$\nThe dimension of the $d$-dimensional volume element $d^d x$ is $d$ times the dimension of a single coordinate $x^{\\mu}$:\n$$[d^d x] = d \\cdot [x^{\\mu}] = d \\cdot (-1) = -d$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $[S]$ and using the condition $[S]=0$, we find:\n$$0 = -d + [\\mathcal{L}]$$\nThis implies that the Lagrangian density must have a mass dimension of $d$:\n$$[\\mathcal{L}] = d$$\n\nFor the expression of $\\mathcal{L}$ to be dimensionally homogeneous, every additive term within it must have the same mass dimension, which must be equal to $[\\mathcal{L}]$. Therefore, we have:\n$$[(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi)(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi)] = [r\\phi^2] = [u\\phi^4] = d$$\nWe will now analyze each of these equalities to find the required dimensions.\n\n1.  **Dimension of the field $\\phi$**\n    We begin with the kinetic term, $\\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi)(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi)$. The numerical prefactor $\\frac{1}{2}$ is dimensionless. The dimension of the term itself is determined by the product $(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi)(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi)$.\n    $$[(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi)(\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi)] = d$$\n    The dimension of a product is the sum of the dimensions. Thus:\n    $$[\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi] + [\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi] = 2[\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi] = d$$\n    This implies $[\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi] = \\frac{d}{2}$.\n    Next, we relate the dimension of the derivative of the field, $\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi$, to the dimension of the field itself, $[\\phi]$. A derivative $\\partial_{\\mu} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{\\mu}}$ has the dimension of an inverse coordinate. The dimension of the operation $\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi$ is therefore:\n    $$[\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi] = [\\phi] - [x^{\\mu}]$$\n    Substituting the given dimension $[x^{\\mu}] = -1$:\n    $$[\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi] = [\\phi] - (-1) = [\\phi] + 1$$\n    Now, by equating the two derived expressions for $[\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi]$, we can solve for $[\\phi]$:\n    $$[\\phi] + 1 = \\frac{d}{2}$$\n    $$[\\phi] = \\frac{d}{2} - 1 = \\frac{d-2}{2}$$\n\n2.  **Dimension of the parameter $r$**\n    Next, we consider the term $\\frac{1}{2} r\\, \\phi^2$. The prefactor $\\frac{1}{2}$ is dimensionless. The dimension of the remaining part must be $d$:\n    $$[r\\phi^2] = d$$\n    Using the sum rule for dimensions of a product:\n    $$[r] + [\\phi^2] = [r] + 2[\\phi] = d$$\n    Solving for $[r]$ and substituting the previously found expression for $[\\phi]$:\n    $$[r] = d - 2[\\phi] = d - 2\\left(\\frac{d-2}{2}\\right) = d - (d-2) = 2$$\n    The dimension of $r$ is $2$, which is consistent with its physical interpretation as a parameter related to the squared mass of the field.\n\n3.  **Dimension of the coupling $u$**\n    Finally, we analyze the interaction term $\\frac{u}{4!}\\,\\phi^4$. The combinatorial factor $\\frac{1}{4!}$ is dimensionless. The dimension of this term must also be $d$:\n    $$[u\\phi^4] = d$$\n    Applying the sum rule for dimensions:\n    $$[u] + [\\phi^4] = [u] + 4[\\phi] = d$$\n    Solving for $[u]$ and substituting the expression for $[\\phi]$:\n    $$[u] = d - 4[\\phi] = d - 4\\left(\\frac{d-2}{2}\\right) = d - 2(d-2) = d - 2d + 4 = 4-d$$\n    The dimension of the coupling constant $u$ is $4-d$.\n\nThe canonical mass dimensions for $\\phi$, $r$, and $u$ in a general $d$-dimensional space are therefore $[\\phi]=\\frac{d-2}{2}$, $[r]=2$, and $[u]=4-d$.",

The full field is $\\phi = \\phi_s + \\phi_f$.\n\nSubstituting this decomposition into the action $S[\\phi]$ gives:\n$$\nS[\\phi_s + \\phi_f] = S[\\phi_s] + S[\\phi_f] + \\int d^d x \\left( r\\,\\phi_s\\phi_f + \\frac{u}{6}\\phi_s^3\\phi_f + \\frac{u}{4}\\phi_s^2\\phi_f^2 + \\frac{u}{6}\\phi_s\\phi_f^3 \\right)\n$$\nThe terms linear and cubic in $\\phi_s$ have been separated from the mixed terms.

            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as a self-contained, mathematically consistent, and well-posed exercise in the application of renormalization group (RG) theory. It provides a specific model defined by a set of beta functions and asks for the derivation of critical exponents based on this model. All necessary information is provided, and the tasks are unambiguous. We can therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe given one-loop RG equations for the dimensionless couplings $u$ and $r$ are:\n$$\n\\beta_u(u,r) = \\frac{d u}{d \\ell} = \\epsilon\\,u - A\\,u^2\n$$\n$$\n\\beta_r(u,r) = \\frac{d r}{d \\ell} = 2\\,r - B\\,u\n$$\nwhere $\\ell = \\ln(b)$ is the logarithmic scaling factor, $\\epsilon  0$ is a small parameter, and $A, B$ are positive constants.\n\n**1. Determination of the Nontrivial Fixed Point $(u^\\ast, r^\\ast)$**\n\nFixed points $(u^\\ast, r^\\ast)$ are defined by the condition that the RG flow ceases, i.e., $\\beta_u(u^\\ast, r^\\ast) = 0$ and $\\beta_r(u^\\ast, r^\\ast) = 0$.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n$$\n\\epsilon\\,u^\\ast - A\\,(u^\\ast)^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\nu^\\ast(\\epsilon - A\\,u^\\ast) = 0\n$$\nThis equation has two solutions. One is the trivial or Gaussian fixed point, $u^\\ast = 0$. The other is the nontrivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point, which is the one of interest.\n$$\n\\epsilon - A\\,u^\\ast = 0 \\implies u^\\ast = \\frac{\\epsilon}{A}\n$$\nSince $\\epsilon  0$ and $A  0$, this fixed point is physically accessible at a non-zero coupling $u^\\ast  0$.\n\nNext, we substitute this result into the second equation:\n$$\n2\\,r^\\ast - B\\,u^\\ast = 0\n$$\n$$\n2\\,r^\\ast = B\\,u^\\ast = B\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{A}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for $r^\\ast$, we get:\n$$\nr^\\ast = \\frac{B\\epsilon}{2A}\n$$\nThus, the nontrivial fixed point is given by $(u^\\ast, r^\\ast) = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{A}, \\frac{B\\epsilon}{2A}\\right)$.\n\n**2. Linearization of the RG Flow and Eigenvalues**\n\nTo analyze the stability of the fixed point and determine scaling exponents, we linearize the flow equations around $(u^\\ast, r^\\ast)$. The dynamics of the deviations $\\delta u = u - u^\\ast$ and $\\delta r = r - r^\\ast$ are governed by the Jacobian matrix $M$ of the beta functions, evaluated at the fixed point.\n$$\nM = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial \\beta_u}{\\partial u}  \\frac{\\partial \\beta_u}{\\partial r} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\beta_r}{\\partial u}  \\frac{\\partial \\beta_r}{\\partial r} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe first compute the partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\beta_u}{\\partial u} = \\epsilon - 2Au\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\beta_u}{\\partial r} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\beta_r}{\\partial u} = -B\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\beta_r}{\\partial r} = 2\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this matrix at the fixed point $(u^\\ast, r^\\ast) = (\\epsilon/A, B\\epsilon/2A)$:\n$$\nM^\\ast = \\left. \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon - 2Au  0 \\\\ -B  2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right|_{(u^\\ast,r^\\ast)} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon - 2A(\\frac{\\epsilon}{A})  0 \\\\ -B  2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon - 2\\epsilon  0 \\\\ -B  2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nM^\\ast = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\epsilon  0 \\\\ -B  2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of the linearized flow matrix are the solutions to the characteristic equation $\\det(M^\\ast - \\lambda I) = 0$. Since $M^\\ast$ is a lower triangular matrix, its eigenvalues are simply its diagonal entries.\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = -\\epsilon\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_2 = 2\n$$\n\n**3. Determination of Critical Exponents $\\nu$ and $\\eta$**\n\nThe eigenvalues of the linearized RG flow matrix are the scaling dimensions, denoted $y_i$, of the eigenoperators near the fixed point.\n- The eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = -\\epsilon$ is negative (since $\\epsilon  0$). It corresponds to an irrelevant direction. Perturbations along this direction decay as the system flows towards the fixed point. The associated correction-to-scaling exponent is $\\omega = -y_u = -(-\\epsilon) = \\epsilon$.\n- The eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = 2$ is positive. It corresponds to a relevant direction. The associated scaling field, which is a linear combination of $u$ and $r$, acts as the physical reduced temperature $t$. Perturbations along this direction grow, driving the system away from the critical fixed point. This relevant scaling dimension is denoted $y_t$. So, $y_t = 2$.\n\nThe correlation length exponent $\\nu$ is related to the relevant scaling dimension $y_t$ by the standard scaling relation:\n$$\n\\nu = \\frac{1}{y_t}\n$$\nSubstituting the value we found for $y_t$:\n$$\n\\nu = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThis is the mean-field value for the correlation length exponent. This result is a direct consequence of the form of the provided $\\beta_r$ function. A more complete one-loop calculation for a model such as $\\phi^4$ theory would include a term proportional to $u \\cdot r$ in $\\beta_r$. This term would modify the derivative $\\frac{\\partial\\beta_r}{\\partial r}$, making it dependent on $u$. When evaluated at $u^\\ast = \\epsilon/A$, this would yield $y_t = 2 - O(\\epsilon)$, resulting in a non-mean-field correction $\\nu \\approx \\frac{1}{2} + O(\\epsilon)$. However, based strictly on the provided equations, $y_t=2$ and $\\nu=1/2$.\n\nThe anomalous dimension $\\eta$ is related to the field strength renormalization. In the context of the flow equations, it appears as a correction to the canonical scaling dimension of the quadratic coupling $r$. The flow equation for $r$ near a fixed point generally takes the form $\\frac{dr}{d\\ell} = (2-\\eta)r + \\dots$.\nThe given flow equation is:\n$$\n\\beta_r(u,r) = 2\\,r - B\\,u\n$$\nBy comparing the coefficient of the term linear in $r$ with the general form $(2-\\eta)r$, we can identify $\\eta$.\n$$\n2 - \\eta = 2 \\implies \\eta = 0\n$$\nThis result, $\\eta=0$ to first order in $\\epsilon$, is consistent with standard one-loop calculations for theories like the $\\phi^4$ model, where the first non-zero contribution to $\\eta$ appears at order $O(\\epsilon^2)$.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided RG flow equations, the exponents are $\\nu = 1/2$ and $\\eta = 0$.\n\nThe final answer is the two-entry row matrix $(\\nu, \\eta)$.",
