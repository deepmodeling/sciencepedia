            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional particle of mass $m$ interacting linearly with a thermal environment that can be modeled microscopically as a collection of independent harmonic oscillators. The composite system is prepared in canonical equilibrium at absolute temperature $T$, and the particle is coarse-grained as the slow variable of interest while the environment is treated as fast degrees of freedom. The effective dynamics of the particle is represented at the coarse-grained level by a Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) in which the environment induces both a history-dependent friction force and a stationary Gaussian random force. The random force $\\eta(t)$ is assumed to be zero-mean, stationary, and Gaussian with correlation $C_{\\eta}(t)=\\langle\\eta(t)\\eta(0)\\rangle$, and the friction force is represented by a convolution of a causal memory kernel $K(t)$ with the particle velocity $v(t)$.\n\nUsing only: (i) classical Hamiltonian mechanics of the system-plus-bath, (ii) canonical equilibrium statistical mechanics, and (iii) linear response theory with time-translation invariance under equilibrium, derive the equilibrium constraint that relates the memory kernel $K(t)$ to the noise correlation $C_{\\eta}(t)$ so that the coarse-grained dynamics is consistent with detailed balance and equipartition.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the equilibrium constraint relating the memory kernel $K(t)$ and the noise correlation $C_{\\eta}(t)$ in a Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE), and then the application of this constraint to a specific form of noise correlation. The derivation must be based on fundamental principles of classical mechanics and statistical mechanics. This constraint is a manifestation of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT).\n\nFirst, we establish the GLE for the particle's velocity $v(t)$. The particle, with mass $m$, is subject to a friction force and a random force from the thermal environment. The GLE is given by:\n$$\nm \\frac{dv(t)}{dt} = -\\int_{-\\infty}^{t} K(t-t') v(t') dt' + \\eta(t)\n$$\nBy causality, the memory kernel $K(t)$ must be zero for negative time arguments, i.e., $K(t-t') = 0$ for $t' > t$. This allows us to rewrite the friction integral with a change of variables $\\tau = t-t'$:\n$$\nm \\frac{dv(t)}{dt} = -\\int_{0}^{\\infty} K(\\tau) v(t-\\tau) d\\tau + \\eta(t)\n$$\nThe random force $\\eta(t)$ is a stationary Gaussian process with zero mean, $\\langle\\eta(t)\\rangle=0$, and its correlation function is $C_{\\eta}(t) = \\langle\\eta(t)\\eta(0)\\rangle$.\n\nTo derive the FDT, we work in the frequency domain. Let $\\tilde{f}(\\omega)$ denote the Fourier transform of a function $f(t)$, defined as $\\tilde{f}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(t) \\exp(-i\\omega t) dt$. Applying the Fourier transform to the GLE, and using the convolution theorem, we get:\n$$\nm (i\\omega) \\tilde{v}(\\omega) = - \\tilde{K}(\\omega) \\tilde{v}(\\omega) + \\tilde{\\eta}(\\omega)\n$$\nHere, $\\tilde{K}(\\omega) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} K(t) \\exp(-i\\omega t) dt$ is the Fourier transform of the causal kernel. We can solve for $\\tilde{v}(\\omega)$:\n$$\n\\tilde{v}(\\omega) = \\frac{\\tilde{\\eta}(\\omega)}{i\\omega m + \\tilde{K}(\\omega)}\n$$\nThe power spectral density of the velocity, $\\tilde{C}_v(\\omega)$, is the Fourier transform of the velocity autocorrelation function $C_v(t) = \\langle v(t) v(0) \\rangle$. Using the Wiener-Khinchin theorem and the expression for $\\tilde{v}(\\omega)$, we relate the velocity spectrum to the noise spectrum $\\tilde{C}_{\\eta}(\\omega)$:\n$$\n\\tilde{C}_v(\\omega) \\propto \\langle |\\tilde{v}(\\omega)|^2 \\rangle = \\frac{\\langle |\\tilde{\\eta}(\\omega)|^2 \\rangle}{|i\\omega m + \\tilde{K}(\\omega)|^2} \\propto \\frac{\\tilde{C}_{\\eta}(\\omega)}{|i\\omega m + \\tilde{K}(\\omega)|^2}\n$$\nThe proportionality constants depend on the specific convention for power spectra, but they cancel out.\n\nNext, we invoke linear response theory, which provides an independent expression for $\\tilde{C}_v(\\omega)$ in thermal equilibrium. The mechanical admittance, $\\chi(\\omega)$, is the response of the velocity to a hypothetical external force $\\tilde{F}_{ext}(\\omega)$, defined as $\\chi(\\omega) = \\tilde{v}(\\omega) / \\tilde{F}_{ext}(\\omega)$. From the GLE, this is $\\chi(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega m + \\tilde{K}(\\omega)}$. The Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (specifically, the Callen-Welton theorem in the classical limit $k_{B}T \\gg \\hbar\\omega$) relates the equilibrium fluctuations (power spectrum) to the dissipative part of the response function (admittance):\n$$\n\\tilde{C}_v(\\omega) = 2 k_B T \\text{Re}[\\chi(\\omega)]\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The real part of the admittance represents energy dissipation. Let's compute $\\text{Re}[\\chi(\\omega)]$:\n$$\n\\text{Re}[\\chi(\\omega)] = \\text{Re}\\left[ \\frac{1}{i\\omega m + \\tilde{K}(\\omega)} \\right] = \\text{Re}\\left[ \\frac{i\\omega m + \\tilde{K}^*(\\omega)}{|i\\omega m + \\tilde{K}(\\omega)|^2} \\right] = \\frac{\\text{Re}[\\tilde{K}(\\omega)]}{|i\\omega m + \\tilde{K}(\\omega)|^2}\n$$\nHere, $\\tilde{K}^*(\\omega)$ is the complex conjugate of $\\tilde{K}(\\omega)$.\n\nNow we equate the two expressions for $\\tilde{C}_v(\\omega)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tilde{C}_{\\eta}(\\omega)}{|i\\omega m + \\tilde{K}(\\omega)|^2} = 2 k_B T \\frac{\\text{Re}[\\tilde{K}(\\omega)]}{|i\\omega m + \\tilde{K}(\\omega)|^2}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the FDT in the frequency domain, which is the desired equilibrium constraint:\n$$\n\\tilde{C}_{\\eta}(\\omega) = 2 k_B T \\text{Re}[\\tilde{K}(\\omega)]\n$$\nTo transform this back to the time domain, we note that for a causal, real kernel $K(t)$, $\\text{Re}[\\tilde{K}(\\omega)] = \\frac{1}{2}(\\tilde{K}(\\omega) + \\tilde{K}^*(\\omega))$. The inverse Fourier transform of $\\tilde{K}^*(\\omega)$ is $K(-t)$. Therefore, taking the inverse Fourier transform of the FDT gives:\n$$\nC_{\\eta}(t) = k_B T (K(t) + K(-t))\n$$\nThis is the general time-domain relationship. Since $K(t)$ is causal ($K(t)=0$ for $t0$) and $C_{\\eta}(t)$ is an even function of time ($C_{\\eta}(t)=C_{\\eta}(-t)$), for $t>0$ we have $K(-t)=0$, which simplifies the relation to:\n$$\nC_{\\eta}(t) = k_B T K(t) \\quad \\text{for} \\quad t>0\n$$\nFrom this, we can express the kernel $K(t)$ directly in terms of the noise correlation for non-negative times:\n$$\nK(t) = \\frac{1}{k_B T} C_{\\eta}(t) \\quad \\text{for} \\quad t \\geq 0\n$$\nand $K(t)=0$ for $t0$.\n\nNow, we apply this result to the specific noise correlation function provided:\n$$\nC_{\\eta}(t) = C_{0}\\,\\exp(-\\alpha|t|)\\,\\cos(\\omega t)\n$$\nwith $C_{0}>0$, $\\alpha>0$, and $\\omega\\geq 0$. For $t \\geq 0$, $|t|=t$, so the correlation function becomes:\n$$\nC_{\\eta}(t) = C_{0}\\,\\exp(-\\alpha t)\\,\\cos(\\omega t) \\quad \\text{for} \\quad t \\geq 0\n$$\nSubstituting this into our derived expression for the kernel gives:\n$$\nK(t) = \\frac{C_{0}}{k_B T} \\exp(-\\alpha t)\\,\\cos(\\omega t) \\quad \\text{for} \\quad t \\geq 0\n$$\nTo represent the causal nature of the kernel for all time $t$, we use the Heaviside step function $\\Theta(t)$, which is defined as $\\Theta(t)=0$ for $t0$ and $\\Theta(t)=1$ for $t \\geq 0$. The final expression for the friction kernel is:\n$$\nK(t) = \\frac{C_{0}}{k_B T} \\exp(-\\alpha t)\\,\\cos(\\omega t) \\Theta(t)\n$$\nThe units of this expression are consistent. The noise correlation $C_{\\eta}(t) = \\langle \\eta(t)\\eta(0) \\rangle$ has units of force squared, i.e., N$^2$. The term $k_B T$ has units of energy, i.e., N$\\cdot$m. Therefore, the prefactor $\\frac{C_{0}}{k_B T}$ has units of $\\frac{\\text{N}^2}{\\text{N} \\cdot \\text{m}} = \\frac{\\text{N}}{\\text{m}}$, as requested in the problem statement. The exponential and cosine terms are dimensionless.",

Its one-sided Laplace transform, $\\tilde{K}(s)$, is calculated according to the provided definition:\n$$\n\\tilde{K}(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} K(t) \\exp(-st) dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\gamma \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda t) \\exp(-st) dt\n$$\nCombining the exponential terms:\n$$\n\\tilde{K}(s) = \\gamma \\lambda \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-(s+\\lambda)t) dt\n$$\nThis is a standard integral, which converges for $\\mathrm{Re}(s+\\lambda)  0$.

The integral term is a convolution, a property of which is $\\mathcal{L}\\left\\{\\int_{0}^{t} f(t-\\tau)g(\\tau)d\\tau\\right\\} = \\tilde{f}(s)\\tilde{g}(s)$. The derivative term transforms as $\\mathcal{L}\\left\\{\\frac{dv(t)}{dt}\\right\\} = s\\tilde{v}(s) - v(0)$. For a linear response calculation of mobility, we assume the system is initially at rest, so $v(0)=0$.\nApplying the Laplace transform to the entire GLE yields:\n$$\nm(s\\tilde{v}(s)) = -\\tilde{K}(s)\\tilde{v}(s) + \\tilde{F}_{\\mathrm{ext}}(s)\n$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the ratio $\\tilde{v}(s)/\\tilde{F}_{\\mathrm{ext}}(s)$, which is the mobility in the Laplace domain, $\\tilde{\\mu}(s)$:\n$$\n(ms + \\tilde{K}(s))\\tilde{v}(s) = \\tilde{F}_{\\mathrm{ext}}(s)\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}(s) = \\frac{\\tilde{v}(s)}{\\tilde{F}_{\\mathrm{ext}}(s)} = \\frac{1}{ms + \\tilde{K}(s)}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the frequency-dependent mobility $\\tilde{\\mu}(\\omega)$, which is defined via the one-sided Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\omega) = \\int_0^\\infty \\exp(i\\omega t)f(t)dt$. Comparing this with the Laplace transform definition, we see that $\\hat{f}(\\omega) = \\tilde{f}(s=-i\\omega)$. The frequency response is therefore obtained by the substitution $s = -i\\omega$ into the Laplace-domain transfer function $\\tilde{\\mu}(s)$.\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}(\\omega) = \\tilde{\\mu}(s=-i\\omega) = \\frac{1}{m(-i\\omega) + \\tilde{K}(-i\\omega)}\n$$\nFirst, we find $\\tilde{K}(-i\\omega)$ from our result for $\\tilde{K}(s)$:\n$$\n\\tilde{K}(-i\\omega) = \\frac{\\gamma \\lambda}{-i\\omega + \\lambda} = \\frac{\\gamma \\lambda}{\\lambda - i\\omega}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\tilde{\\mu}(\\omega)$:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{-im\\omega + \\frac{\\gamma \\lambda}{\\lambda - i\\omega}}\n$$\nTo simplify, we combine the terms in the denominator:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{-im\\omega(\\lambda - i\\omega) + \\gamma \\lambda}{\\lambda - i\\omega}} = \\frac{\\lambda - i\\omega}{-im\\lambda\\omega - m\\omega^2 + \\gamma \\lambda}\n$$\nRearranging the terms in the denominator to group real and imaginary parts:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}(\\omega) = \\frac{\\lambda - i\\omega}{(\\gamma\\lambda - m\\omega^2) - i(m\\lambda\\omega)}\n$$\n\n**Task 3: Identify the resonance frequency $\\omega_{r}$.**\n\nThe problem defines the resonance frequency $\\omega_r$ as the frequency where the real part of the \"dynamic denominator\" in the mobility vanishes. Based on the simplified expression for $\\tilde{\\mu}(\\omega)$, the most natural and physically meaningful choice for the dynamic denominator is $D(\\omega) = (\\gamma\\lambda - m\\omega^2) - i(m\\lambda\\omega)$. This corresponds to the characteristic polynomial of the equivalent second-order system from which a resonance phenomenon arises.\n\nThe real part of this denominator is $\\mathrm{Re}[D(\\omega)] = \\gamma\\lambda - m\\omega^2$.\nWe set this to zero to find the resonance frequency $\\omega_r$:\n$$\n\\gamma\\lambda - m\\omega_{r}^2 = 0\n$$\nSolving for $\\omega_r$:\n$$\nm\\omega_{r}^2 = \\gamma\\lambda\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_{r}^2 = \\frac{\\gamma\\lambda}{m}\n$$\nSince $\\omega_r$ represents a physical frequency, we take the positive root:\n$$\n\\omega_{r} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma\\lambda}{m}}\n$$\nThis frequency corresponds to the undamped natural frequency of an equivalent RLC circuit or a mass-spring-damper system, where the resonance peak in the response amplitude is centered in the underdamped regime, as mentioned in the problem statement.\n\nThe three requested quantities are:\n1. $\\tilde{K}(s) = \\frac{\\gamma \\lambda}{s+\\lambda}$\n2. $\\tilde{\\mu}(\\omega) = \\frac{\\lambda - i\\omega}{\\gamma\\lambda - m\\omega^{2} - i m\\lambda\\omega}$\n3. $\\omega_r = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma\\lambda}{m}}$\nThese are presented as a single row matrix in the final answer.",

The formal solution for $y_{i}(t)$, assuming the system is in a stationary state (integrating from $t_{0} \\to -\\infty$), is given by:\n$$\ny_{i}(t) \\;=\\; \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} \\exp\\big(-b_{i}(t-s)\\big) \\left( a_{i}\\,v(s)\\,ds \\;+\\; \\sigma_{i}\\,dW_{i}(s) \\right)\n$$\nWe can separate this into two parts: a deterministic part driven by the velocity $v(s)$ and a stochastic part driven by the noise $dW_{i}(s)$.\n$$\ny_{i}(t) \\;=\\; \\underbrace{\\int_{-\\infty}^{t} a_{i}\\,\\exp\\big(-b_{i}(t-s)\\big)\\,v(s)\\,ds}_{\\eta_{i}(t)} \\;+\\; \\underbrace{\\int_{-\\infty}^{t} \\sigma_{i}\\,\\exp\\big(-b_{i}(t-s)\\big)\\,dW_{i}(s)}_{\\tilde{R}_{i}(t)}\n$$\nSo, $y_{i}(t) = \\eta_{i}(t) + \\tilde{R}_{i}(t)$.\n\nNow, we substitute this back into the equation for the velocity $v(t)$:\n$$\nm\\,\\frac{dv(t)}{dt} \\;=\\; -\\,\\partial_{x}U(x(t)) - \\sum_{i=1}^{M} y_{i}(t) \\;=\\; -\\,\\partial_{x}U(x(t)) - \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\left( \\eta_{i}(t) + \\tilde{R}_{i}(t) \\right)\n$$\nRearranging the terms gives:\n$$\nm\\,\\dot{v}(t) \\;=\\; -\\,\\partial_{x}U(x(t)) - \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\eta_{i}(t) - \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\tilde{R}_{i}(t)\n$$\n\nLet's examine the sum of the $\\eta_{i}(t)$ terms:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\eta_{i}(t) \\;=\\; \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} a_{i}\\,\\exp\\big(-b_{i}(t-s)\\big)\\,v(s)\\,ds\n$$\nBy swapping the summation and integration:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\eta_{i}(t) \\;=\\; \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{M} a_{i}\\,\\exp\\big(-b_{i}(t-s)\\big) \\right) v(s)\\,ds \\;=\\; \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} K(t-s)\\,v(s)\\,ds\n$$\nThis is precisely the friction term from the original GLE. The equation for $v(t)$ becomes:\n$$\nm\\,\\dot{v}(t) \\;=\\; -\\,\\partial_{x}U(x(t)) - \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} K(t-s)\\,v(s)\\,ds - \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\tilde{R}_{i}(t)\n$$\nBy comparing this with the original GLE, we can identify the total random force $R(t)$ as:\n$$\nR(t) \\;=\\; -\\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\tilde{R}_{i}(t)\n$$\n\nNext, we must enforce the FDT. We calculate the autocorrelation function of our derived $R(t)$ and equate it to the required form $k_{B}T\\,K(|t-s|)$.\n$$\n\\langle R(t)\\,R(s)\\rangle \\;=\\; \\left\\langle \\left( -\\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\tilde{R}_{i}(t) \\right) \\left( -\\sum_{j=1}^{M} \\tilde{R}_{j}(s) \\right) \\right\\rangle \\;=\\; \\sum_{i=1}^{M}\\sum_{j=1}^{M} \\langle \\tilde{R}_{i}(t)\\,\\tilde{R}_{j}(s) \\rangle\n$$\nSince the Wiener processes $W_{i}(t)$ and $W_{j}(t)$ are independent for $i \\neq j$, their stochastic integrals $\\tilde{R}_{i}(t)$ and $\\tilde{R}_{j}(s)$ are also uncorrelated. Thus, $\\langle \\tilde{R}_{i}(t)\\,\\tilde{R}_{j}(s) \\rangle = 0$ for $i \\neq j$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\langle R(t)\\,R(s)\\rangle \\;=\\; \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\langle \\tilde{R}_{i}(t)\\,\\tilde{R}_{i}(s) \\rangle\n$$\nThe term $\\tilde{R}_{i}(t)$ is a stationary Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Its autocorrelation function is a standard result. For $t \\ge s$:\n$$\n\\langle \\tilde{R}_{i}(t)\\,\\tilde{R}_{i}(s) \\rangle \\;=\\; \\left\\langle \\left(\\int_{-\\infty}^{t} \\sigma_{i}\\,e^{-b_{i}(t-u)}dW_{i}(u)\\right) \\left(\\int_{-\\infty}^{s} \\sigma_{i}\\,e^{-b_{i}(s-u')}dW_{i}(u')\\right) \\right\\rangle\n$$\nUsing the Itō isometry $\\langle \\int f dW \\int g dW \\rangle = \\int fg du$:\n$$\n\\langle \\tilde{R}_{i}(t)\\,\\tilde{R}_{i}(s) \\rangle \\;=\\; \\sigma_{i}^{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{s} e^{-b_{i}(t-u)} e^{-b_{i}(s-u)} du \\;=\\; \\sigma_{i}^{2} e^{-b_{i}(t+s)} \\int_{-\\infty}^{s} e^{2b_{i}u} du\n$$\n$$\n\\;=\\; \\sigma_{i}^{2} e^{-b_{i}(t+s)} \\left[ \\frac{e^{2b_{i}u}}{2b_{i}} \\right]_{-\\infty}^{s} \\;=\\; \\sigma_{i}^{2} e^{-b_{i}(t+s)} \\frac{e^{2b_{i}s}}{2b_{i}} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\sigma_{i}^{2}}{2b_{i}} e^{-b_{i}(t-s)}\n$$\nFor a general pair of times $t$ and $s$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\langle \\tilde{R}_{i}(t)\\,\\tilde{R}_{i}(s) \\rangle \\;=\\; \\frac{\\sigma_{i}^{2}}{2b_{i}} \\exp(-b_{i}|t-s|)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the total correlation of $R(t)$:\n$$\n\\langle R(t)\\,R(s)\\rangle \\;=\\; \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\frac{\\sigma_{i}^{2}}{2b_{i}} \\exp(-b_{i}|t-s|)\n$$\nFinally, we equate this result with the FDT condition:\n$$\n\\langle R(t)\\,R(s)\\rangle \\;=\\; k_{B}T\\,K(|t-s|) \\;=\\; k_{B}T \\sum_{i=1}^{M} a_{i}\\,\\exp(-b_{i}|t-s|)\n$$\nBy comparing the two series expansions term-by-term (assuming the decay constants $b_{i}$ are distinct), we obtain a condition for each $i$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma_{i}^{2}}{2b_{i}} \\;=\\; k_{B}T\\,a_{i}\n$$\nSolving for $\\sigma_{i}^{2}$ yields the final expression:\n$$\n\\sigma_{i}^{2} \\;=\\; 2\\,k_{B}T\\,a_{i}\\,b_{i}\n$$\nThis result ensures that the augmented Markovian system is dynamically and statistically equivalent to the original non-Markovian GLE, correctly reproducing both the dissipative memory effects and the thermal fluctuations as dictated by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.",
