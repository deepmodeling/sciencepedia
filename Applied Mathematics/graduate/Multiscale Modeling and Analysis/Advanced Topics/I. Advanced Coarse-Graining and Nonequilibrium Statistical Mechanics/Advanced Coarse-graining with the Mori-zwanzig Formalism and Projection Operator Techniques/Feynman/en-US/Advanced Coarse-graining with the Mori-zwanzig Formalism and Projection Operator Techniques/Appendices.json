A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe solution is presented in two parts as requested: first, the derivation and verification of the value of $Lg$, and second, the explanation of the implications for the Mori-Zwanzig formalism.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of $Lg$**\n\nThe Liouville operator $L$, also known as the generator of the Koopman operator semigroup, describes the infinitesimal time evolution of an observable $g(z)$ along the flow of a dynamical system $\\dot{z} = F(z)$. It is defined from first principles by the action of the vector field on the observable:\n$$\nLg(z) = \\frac{d}{dt} g(z(t)) \\bigg|_{t=0}\n$$\nUsing the chain rule, this can be expressed as the dot product of the vector field $F(z)$ and the gradient of the observable $\\nabla g(z)$:\n$$\nLg(z) = F(z) \\cdot \\nabla g(z)\n$$\nFor the given planar rotation system, the state vector is $z=(x,y)$ and the vector field is $F(x,y) = (\\dot{x}, \\dot{y}) = (-y, x)$.\nThe observable is $g(x,y) = x^{2}+y^{2}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the gradient of $g(x,y)$:\n$$\n\\nabla g(x,y) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y}\\right)\n$$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^{2}+y^{2}) = 2x\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^{2}+y^{2}) = 2y\n$$\nSo, the gradient is:\n$$\n\\nabla g(x,y) = (2x, 2y)\n$$\nNow, we can compute $Lg$ by taking the dot product of $F(x,y)$ and $\\nabla g(x,y)$:\n$$\nLg(x,y) = F(x,y) \\cdot \\nabla g(x,y) = (-y, x) \\cdot (2x, 2y)\n$$\nPerforming the dot product gives:\n$$\nLg(x,y) = (-y)(2x) + (x)(2y) = -2xy + 2xy = 0\n$$\nThis result holds for all $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Thus, we have verified that $Lg$ is identically zero. This is expected, as $g(x,y) = x^{2}+y^{2}$ represents the squared radius of the particle's position, which is a conserved quantity (an integral of motion) for this rotation system. An observable is an invariant of motion if and only if it is in the null space of the Liouville operator, i.e., $Lg = 0$.\n\n**Part 2: Implications for the Mori–Zwanzig Formalism**\n\nThe Mori–Zwanzig (MZ) formalism is a projection operator technique used in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to derive a coarse-grained description of a system's dynamics. It formally partitions the full dynamics into a resolved part (the \"slow\" variables of interest) and an unresolved part (the remaining \"fast\" degrees of freedom).\n\nLet the space of observables be a Hilbert space. We define a projection operator $P$ that projects any observable onto the subspace spanned by our chosen set of resolved variables. The complementary operator $Q=1-P$ projects onto the orthogonal subspace. The Liouville equation, $\\frac{d}{dt}A(t) = LA(t)$, can be manipulated using these operators to yield a Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE).\n\nThe GLE for a resolved observable $A(t)$ has the general structure:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}A(t) = (\\text{Instantaneous Drift}) + (\\text{Memory Term}) + (\\text{Fluctuating Force})\n$$\nLet's analyze each term in the context of our observable $g(x,y)$, which we assume is a member of the resolved subspace (i.e., $Pg = g$). The fact that $g$ is an invariant of motion, $Lg = 0$, has profound implications for each component of the GLE.\n\n1.  **Instantaneous Drift**: This term describes the part of the dynamics that maps the resolved subspace onto itself. It is given by $PLA$. For our observable $g$, this term is $PLg$. Since we have proven that $Lg=0$, the drift term is:\n    $$\n    PLg = P(0) = 0\n    $$\n    The instantaneous drift for the invariant observable $g$ is identically zero. This means there is no systematic, instantaneous tendency for $g$ to change its value due to dynamics within the resolved subspace.\n\n2.  **Fluctuating Force**: This term, often denoted $F(t)$, represents the influence of the unresolved degrees of freedom on the resolved ones, arising from the initial state of the unresolved variables. It is formally defined via $F(t) = PL \\exp(QLt) Q g(0)$. A key component is $QLg$. Since $Lg=0$, we have:\n    $$\n    QLg = Q(0) = 0\n    $$\n    Because the term that generates the force is zero, the fluctuating force $F(t)$ is zero for all $t \\ge 0$. This means the invariant observable $g$ experiences no fluctuating \"force\" from the orthogonal part of the system.\n\n3.  **Memory Term**: This term describes the delayed response of the resolved variables to their own past history, mediated by the unresolved dynamics. The memory kernel, $K(t)$, is given by an expression of the form $K(t) \\propto PL\\exp(QLt)QL\\dots$. A crucial component of this kernel is the term $QLA$, which couples the resolved dynamics to the orthogonal subspace. For our observable $g$, this coupling is $QLg$. As shown above, $QLg=0$. Consequently, the entire memory kernel is identically zero:\n    $$\n    K(t) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } t \\ge 0\n    $$\n    This implies that the evolution of $g$ has no dependence on its past values; there are no memory effects.\n\nIn summary, if an invariant of motion $g$ (where $Lg=0$) is included in the set of resolved variables, the GLE for that observable collapses completely. The drift, memory, and fluctuating force terms all vanish. The resulting equation of motion is simply:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}g(t) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the Mori-Zwanzig formalism is consistent: it correctly reproduces the trivial dynamics of a conserved quantity. The inclusion of such an observable in the resolved set effectively decouples it from the rest of the system's dynamics within the coarse-grained description, reflecting its inherent invariance.",

All necessary information is provided.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective mathematical language, free from subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\nThe problem is **valid** as it is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Generalized Langevin Equation\n\nThe Mori-Zwanzig formalism provides an exact equation for the evolution of the resolved variable, $x(t)$, by formally eliminating the unresolved variables $y(t)$ and $z(t)$. The resulting Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) has three components: a drift term, a memory term, and a fluctuating force term. We will now derive each of these components from first principles for the given system.\n\nThe evolution of any observable $f(X)$ is governed by the Liouville operator $L$, where $\\frac{d}{dt} f(X(t)) = (L f)(X(t))$ and $L \\equiv \\dot{X} \\cdot \\nabla_X$. For our system, the Liouville operator is:\n$$\nL = (-\\lambda x + c y)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + (\\kappa x + \\omega z)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + (-\\omega y)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\n$$\nWe define a projection operator $P$ that projects any observable onto the subspace of observables that are functions of only the resolved variable $x$. For the linear observables in this problem, this means:\n$$\nPx = x, \\quad Py = 0, \\quad Pz = 0\n$$\nThe orthogonal operator $Q = I - P$ acts as:\n$$\nQx = 0, \\quad Qy = y, \\quad Qz = z\n$$\nThe exact GLE for $\\dot{x}(t)$ is obtained by substituting a formal solution for the unresolved variables back into the original equation for $\\dot{x}(t)$. The equation for $\\dot{x}$ is $\\dot{x}(t) = (Lx)(X(t)) = -\\lambda x(t) + c y(t)$. This is not closed because of $y(t)$. We must find an expression for $y(t)$ in terms of $x(s)$ for $s \\le t$ and the initial conditions $y(0), z(0)$.\nThe dynamics of the unresolved variables are:\n$$\n\\dot{y}(t) = \\kappa x(t) + \\omega z(t), \\quad \\dot{z}(t) = -\\omega y(t)\n$$\nThis is a driven harmonic oscillator, where $x(t)$ is the driving term. The solution for $y(t)$ can be found using the variation of parameters method. The homogeneous solution corresponds to $x(t)=0$, which is $\\dot{y}=\\omega z, \\dot{z}=-\\omega y$, giving $y_h(t) = y(0)\\cos(\\omega t) + z(0)\\sin(\\omega t)$. The full solution is the sum of this homogeneous part and a particular part that accounts for the driving term $\\kappa x(t)$:\n$$\ny(t) = y(0)\\cos(\\omega t) + z(0)\\sin(\\omega t) + \\int_0^t \\cos(\\omega(t-s))[\\kappa x(s)] ds\n$$\nNow, we substitute this exact expression for $y(t)$ back into the equation for $\\dot{x}(t)$:\n$$\n\\dot{x}(t) = -\\lambda x(t) + c \\left[ y(0)\\cos(\\omega t) + z(0)\\sin(\\omega t) + \\kappa \\int_0^t \\cos(\\omega(t-s)) x(s) ds \\right]\n$$\nRearranging the terms gives the final GLE:\n$$\n\\dot{x}(t) = -\\lambda x(t) + c\\kappa \\int_0^t \\cos(\\omega(t-s)) x(s) ds + c(y(0)\\cos(\\omega t) + z(0)\\sin(\\omega t))\n$$\nThis matches the target form. By comparing the terms, we can identify the memory kernel and the fluctuating force.\n\n1.  **Drift (Markovian) Term:** The term that depends only on the instantaneous value $x(t)$ is $-\\lambda x(t)$. This is the drift.\n\n2.  **Memory Kernel Term:** The memory integral is $\\int_0^t c\\kappa \\cos(\\omega(t-s)) x(s) ds$. This is of the form $\\int_0^t K_{form}(t-s)x(s)ds$. The kernel is therefore:\n    $$\n    K(t) = c\\kappa \\cos(\\omega t)\n    $$\n\n3.  **Fluctuating Force Term:** The term that depends only on the initial conditions of the unresolved variables is:\n    $$\n    F(t) = c(y(0)\\cos(\\omega t) + z(0)\\sin(\\omega t))\n    $$\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the Memory Kernel and Homogenization\n\n**Memory Kernel Behavior:**\nThe derived memory kernel is $K(t) = c\\kappa \\cos(\\omega t)$. This function is periodic and does not decay as $t \\to \\infty$. Its amplitude, $|c\\kappa|$, remains constant. This non-decaying memory is a direct consequence of the physics of the fast subsystem. The variables $(y,z)$ constitute an undamped harmonic oscillator. Any influence from the slow variable $x(t)$ (via the $\\kappa x(t)$ term in $\\dot{y}$) transfers energy to this oscillator, which then persists indefinitely, oscillating with frequency $\\omega$. This \"memory\" of past states of $x(t)$ is encoded in the phase and amplitude of the $(y,z)$ oscillator and is fed back into the evolution of $x(t)$ via the $cy(t)$ term. Without any damping mechanism in the fast subsystem, the memory never fades.\n\n**Failure of Naive Homogenization:**\nNaive homogenization techniques are typically employed when there is a clear separation of timescales and the fast variables' correlations decay rapidly. These methods seek a simplified, Markovian description for the slow variable.\nA common approach is to assume the fast subsystem is always in a \"quasi-steady state\" determined by the current value of the slow variable. For the fast dynamics:\n$$\n\\dot{y} = \\kappa x + \\omega z, \\quad \\dot{z} = -\\omega y\n$$\nSetting the time derivatives to zero ($\\dot{y}=0, \\dot{z}=0$) yields $y=0$ and $\\kappa x + \\omega z = 0$. Substituting $y=0$ into the equation for $x$ gives $\\dot{x} = -\\lambda x$. This approximation completely decouples the subsystems and discards the crucial feedback captured by the $c\\kappa$ term. It is fundamentally incorrect because the fast system is oscillatory, not relaxing to a fixed point.\nAnother approach might involve averaging over the fast oscillations. Assuming $y(t)$ oscillates rapidly around zero, one might replace $y(t)$ with its average value, $\\langle y \\rangle = 0$, in the equation for $\\dot{x}$. This again leads to the incorrect equation $\\dot{x} = -\\lambda x$.\nThese methods fail because their core assumption—that the influence of the fast variables can be represented by an instantaneous function of the slow variable (or simply averaged away)—is violated. This assumption is mathematically equivalent to stating that the memory kernel $K(t)$ is proportional to a Dirac delta function, $K(t) \\propto \\delta(t)$. This requires the time integral of the kernel to converge, which in turn requires the kernel to decay sufficiently fast. Our kernel $K(t) = c\\kappa \\cos(\\omega t)$ does not decay at all, and its integral $\\int_0^\\infty K(t) dt$ does not converge.\nThe Mori-Zwanzig formalism, being an exact reformulation, does not make such approximations. It correctly identifies the nature of the memory through the orthogonal propagator $e^{QLt}$. The fact that the generator of orthogonal dynamics $QL$ has purely imaginary eigenvalues $(\\pm i\\omega)$ directly leads to a purely oscillatory, non-decaying propagator and thus a non-decaying memory kernel. The formalism correctly shows that a valid coarse-grained model for this system must be non-Markovian.",
