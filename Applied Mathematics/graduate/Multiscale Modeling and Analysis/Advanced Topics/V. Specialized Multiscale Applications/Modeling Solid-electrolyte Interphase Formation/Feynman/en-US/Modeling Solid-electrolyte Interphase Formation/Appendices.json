There are no contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the activation free energy, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, within the framework of Marcus theory, assuming harmonic free energy surfaces for the reactant (oxidized state, $R$) and product (reduced state, $P$).\n\nLet $q$ be the collective nuclear coordinate. The free energy surfaces for the reactant and product states, $G_R(q)$ and $G_P(q)$, are parabolas of identical curvature. Let the constant of curvature be $c$. We can define the reactant parabola with its minimum at $q=0$ and a reference free energy of $0$:\n$$G_R(q) = c q^2$$\n\nThe product parabola has its minimum shifted to a coordinate $q_P$ and its free energy minimum is $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ relative to the reactant minimum:\n$$G_P(q) = c(q-q_P)^2 + \\Delta G^{\\circ}$$\n\nThe reorganization energy, $\\lambda$, is defined as the energy cost to distort the reactant system from its equilibrium geometry ($q=0$) to the equilibrium geometry of the product state ($q=q_P$) without the electron transfer occurring. Mathematically, this is the energy of the reactant state evaluated at the product's equilibrium coordinate:\n$$\\lambda = G_R(q_P) - G_R(0) = c(q_P)^2 - 0 = c q_P^2$$\n\nThe transition state occurs at the nuclear coordinate $q^{\\ddagger}$ where the two free energy surfaces intersect, i.e., $G_R(q^{\\ddagger}) = G_P(q^{\\ddagger})$. We solve for $q^{\\ddagger}$:\n$$c(q^{\\ddagger})^2 = c(q^{\\ddagger} - q_P)^2 + \\Delta G^{\\circ}$$\n$$c(q^{\\ddagger})^2 = c((q^{\\ddagger})^2 - 2q^{\\ddagger}q_P + q_P^2) + \\Delta G^{\\circ}$$\n$$0 = -2cq^{\\ddagger}q_P + cq_P^2 + \\Delta G^{\\circ}$$\n$$2cq^{\\ddagger}q_P = cq_P^2 + \\Delta G^{\\circ}$$\n\nUsing the definition $\\lambda = cq_P^2$, we can substitute this into the equation:\n$$2cq^{\\ddagger}q_P = \\lambda + \\Delta G^{\\circ}$$\n$$q^{\\ddagger} = \\frac{\\lambda + \\Delta G^{\\circ}}{2cq_P}$$\nWe can also express $2cq_P$ in terms of $\\lambda$. Since $\\lambda = cq_P^2$, we have $q_P = \\sqrt{\\lambda/c}$, which gives $2cq_P = 2c\\sqrt{\\lambda/c} = 2\\sqrt{\\lambda c}$. This is not the most direct path. Instead, we can rearrange the expression for $q^{\\ddagger}$ and substitute $\\lambda = cq_P^2$:\n$$q^{\\ddagger} = q_P\\frac{\\lambda + \\Delta G^{\\circ}}{2cq_P^2} = q_P\\frac{\\lambda + \\Delta G^{\\circ}}{2\\lambda}$$\n\nThe activation free energy, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, is the free energy of the transition state relative to the reactant minimum. It is the value of the reactant's free energy parabola at the crossing point $q^{\\ddagger}$:\n$$\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} = G_R(q^{\\ddagger}) = c(q^{\\ddagger})^2$$\nSubstituting the expression for $q^{\\ddagger}$:\n$$\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} = c \\left( q_P\\frac{\\lambda + \\Delta G^{\\circ}}{2\\lambda} \\right)^2 = c q_P^2 \\frac{(\\lambda + \\Delta G^{\\circ})^2}{4\\lambda^2}$$\n\nAgain, using $\\lambda = cq_P^2$, we arrive at the classic Marcus expression for the activation energy:\n$$\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} = \\lambda \\frac{(\\lambda + \\Delta G^{\\circ})^2}{4\\lambda^2} = \\frac{(\\lambda + \\Delta G^{\\circ})^2}{4\\lambda}$$\nThis is the required analytic expression for the activation free energy.\n\nNext, we compute the electron-transfer rate constant, $k$. The problem states that the rate follows Transition State Theory (TST) with a prefactor $k_0$. The rate constant is given by an Arrhenius-type equation:\n$$k = k_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{RT}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$:\n$$k = k_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\lambda + \\Delta G^{\\circ})^2}{4\\lambda RT}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values. It is critical to ensure all units are in the SI system for consistency.\n-   $\\lambda = 95\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} = 95000\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$\n-   $\\Delta G^{\\circ} = -25\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} = -25000\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$\n-   $k_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n-   $R = 8.314\\,462\\,618\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n-   $T = 298.15\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless argument of the exponential function, which we denote as $X$:\n$$X = \\frac{(\\lambda + \\Delta G^{\\circ})^2}{4\\lambda RT}$$\n$$X = \\frac{(95000\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} - 25000\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}})^2}{4 \\times (95000\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}) \\times (8.314\\,462\\,618\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (298.15\\ \\mathrm{K})}$$\n$$X = \\frac{(70000\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}})^2}{4 \\times 95000 \\times 8.314\\,462\\,618 \\times 298.15\\ \\mathrm{J^2\\,mol^{-2}}}$$\n$$X = \\frac{4.9 \\times 10^9}{942003284.93...} \\approx 5.2016709$$\n\nNow we can calculate the rate constant $k$:\n$$k = (1.0 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\exp(-X)$$\n$$k = (1.0 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\exp(-5.2016709...)$$\n$$k \\approx (1.0 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\times 0.005507353$$\n$$k \\approx 55073.53\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required:\n$$k \\approx 5.507 \\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$",

With no sources or sinks within the SEI layer, the mass conservation equation is $\\frac{dJ}{dx} = 0$. Using Fick's law, $J = -D \\frac{dc}{dx}$, and since $D$ is constant, this becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2c}{dx^2} = 0\n$$\nIntegrating this equation twice with respect to $x$ gives a linear concentration profile:\n$$\nc(x) = A x + B\n$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are integration constants. We apply the boundary conditions to determine these constants:\n1.  At the electrode-SEI interface, $x=0$, the concentration is $c_s$: $c(0) = c_s$.\n2.  At the SEI-electrolyte interface, $x=L$, the concentration is the bulk concentration, $c_b$: $c(L) = c_b$.\n\nFrom the first boundary condition, $c(0) = A(0) + B = c_s$, which gives $B = c_s$.\nFrom the second boundary condition, $c(L) = A L + c_s = c_b$, which gives $A = \\frac{c_b - c_s}{L}$.\n\nThus, the concentration profile is:\n$$\nc(x) = \\frac{c_b - c_s}{L} x + c_s\n$$\nThe diffusive flux of the species towards the interface at $x=0$ is given by $J = -D \\frac{dc}{dx}$:\n$$\nJ = -D \\left( \\frac{c_b - c_s}{L} \\right) = D \\frac{c_s - c_b}{L}\n$$\nThe flux is negative, indicating movement in the negative $x$ direction, as expected since $c_s < c_b$. The consumption flux at the interface, let's call it $J_{\\mathrm{cons}}$, is the magnitude of species arriving at $x=0$. Therefore, $J_{\\mathrm{cons}} = -J = D \\frac{c_b - c_s}{L}$.\n\nThe problem requires equating this consumption flux to the interfacial reaction rate $R(c_s)$:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{cons}} = R(c_s) \\implies D \\frac{c_b - c_s}{L} = k_1 c_s + k_2 c_s^2\n$$\nThis equation implicitly defines $c_s$ as a function of $L$. To find an explicit expression for $c_s(L)$, we rearrange the equation into a standard quadratic form for $c_s$:\n$$\nD(c_b - c_s) = L(k_1 c_s + k_2 c_s^2)\n$$\n$$\nD c_b - D c_s = L k_1 c_s + L k_2 c_s^2\n$$\n$$\n(L k_2) c_s^2 + (L k_1 + D) c_s - D c_b = 0\n$$\nSolving this quadratic equation for $c_s$ using the quadratic formula $c_s = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$\nc_s(L) = \\frac{-(L k_1 + D) \\pm \\sqrt{(L k_1 + D)^2 - 4(L k_2)(-D c_b)}}{2 L k_2}\n$$\n$$\nc_s(L) = \\frac{-(L k_1 + D) \\pm \\sqrt{(L k_1 + D)^2 + 4 L k_2 D c_b}}{2 L k_2}\n$$\nSince $c_s$ must be a physical concentration, it must be non-negative. All parameters ($L$, $k_1$, $k_2$, $D$, $c_b$) are positive. The term $-(L k_1 + D)$ is negative. The square root term is strictly greater than $\\sqrt{(L k_1 + D)^2} = |L k_1 + D| = L k_1 + D$. Thus, to ensure $c_s > 0$, we must choose the positive sign.\nThe physically valid solution is:\n$$\nc_s(L) = \\frac{-(L k_1 + D) + \\sqrt{(L k_1 + D)^2 + 4 L k_2 D c_b}}{2 L k_2}\n$$\n\n#### Part 2: Derivation of the Critical Thickness $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}$\n\nThe critical thickness $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ is defined as the thickness at which the quadratic autocatalytic contribution to the reaction rate equals the linear contribution:\n$$\nk_2 c_s^2 = k_1 c_s\n$$\nSince $k_1 > 0$, reaction only occurs if $c_s > 0$. We can thus divide by $c_s$:\n$$\nk_2 c_s = k_1 \\implies c_s = \\frac{k_1}{k_2}\n$$\nSo, $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ is the thickness $L$ for which the interfacial concentration is precisely $c_s = \\frac{k_1}{k_2}$. We can find this thickness by substituting this value of $c_s$ into the mass balance equation derived in Part 1:\n$$\nD \\frac{c_b - c_s}{L} = k_1 c_s + k_2 c_s^2\n$$\nAt $L = L_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, the right-hand side, based on the defining condition, becomes:\n$$\nR\\left(\\frac{k_1}{k_2}\\right) = k_1 \\left(\\frac{k_1}{k_2}\\right) + k_2 \\left(\\frac{k_1}{k_2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{k_1^2}{k_2} + \\frac{k_1^2}{k_2} = 2\\frac{k_1^2}{k_2}\n$$\nNow, we set the diffusive flux at $L = L_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ and $c_s = k_1/k_2$ equal to this rate:\n$$\nD \\frac{c_b - \\frac{k_1}{k_2}}{L_{\\mathrm{crit}}} = 2\\frac{k_1^2}{k_2}\n$$\nWe can now solve for $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{D \\left(c_b - \\frac{k_1}{k_2}\\right)}{2\\frac{k_1^2}{k_2}} = \\frac{D \\frac{k_2 c_b - k_1}{k_2}}{2\\frac{k_1^2}{k_2}}\n$$\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{D(k_2 c_b - k_1)}{2 k_1^2}\n$$\nThe problem states the assumption $k_2 c_b > k_1$, which ensures that the numerator is positive, and thus $L_{\\mathrm{crit}} > 0$. This confirms the consistency of the problem setup.\n\n#### Part 3: Analysis of Finite-Time Blow-up\n\nFinite-time blow-up would occur if the thickness $L(t)$ grew to infinity in a finite amount of time, i.e., $L(t) \\to \\infty$ as $t \\to t_f$ for some finite time $t_f$. The growth of the SEI layer is described by the ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{dt} = \\Omega R(c_s)\n$$\nUsing the mass balance relationship $R(c_s) = D \\frac{c_b - c_s}{L}$, we can rewrite the growth law as:\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{dt} = \\frac{\\Omega D (c_b - c_s(L))}{L}\n$$\nTo analyze the long-term behavior of $L(t)$, we examine the behavior of $c_s(L)$ as $L \\to \\infty$. As the SEI layer becomes very thick, its resistance to diffusion increases. This causes the flux to decrease, which in turn requires the interfacial concentration $c_s$ to become very small. In the limit $L \\to \\infty$, we expect $c_s \\to 0$.\nLet's analyze the mass balance equation for large $L$:\n$$\nD \\frac{c_b - c_s}{L} = k_1 c_s + k_2 c_s^2\n$$\nSince $c_s \\to 0$ as $L \\to \\infty$, the quadratic term $k_2 c_s^2$ becomes negligible compared to the linear term $k_1 c_s$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\nD \\frac{c_b - c_s}{L} \\approx k_1 c_s\n$$\n$$\nD c_b - D c_s \\approx L k_1 c_s\n$$\n$$\nD c_b \\approx (L k_1 + D) c_s\n$$\n$$\nc_s(L) \\approx \\frac{D c_b}{L k_1 + D}\n$$\nFor very large $L$, this further simplifies to $c_s(L) \\sim \\frac{D c_b}{L k_1}$, showing that $c_s$ decays as $1/L$.\nNow, substitute this asymptotic behavior of $c_s$ back into the growth ODE. Since $c_s \\to 0$, the term $c_b - c_s(L)$ approaches $c_b$.\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{dt} \\approx \\frac{\\Omega D c_b}{L}\n$$\nThis is a separable differential equation:\n$$\nL dL = (\\Omega D c_b) dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from an initial state $(t_0, L_0)$ to a later state $(t, L(t))$:\n$$\n\\int_{L_0}^{L(t)} L' dL' = \\int_{t_0}^{t} (\\Omega D c_b) dt'\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} [L'^2]_{L_0}^{L(t)} = (\\Omega D c_b) [t']_{t_0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}(L(t)^2 - L_0^2) = \\Omega D c_b (t - t_0)\n$$\n$$\nL(t)^2 = L_0^2 + 2 \\Omega D c_b (t - t_0)\n$$\n$$\nL(t) = \\sqrt{L_0^2 + 2 \\Omega D c_b (t - t_0)}\n$$\nThis is the well-known parabolic growth law, characteristic of diffusion-limited processes. The thickness $L(t)$ grows proportionally to $\\sqrt{t}$ for large times. This function $L(t)$ is defined for all $t \\ge t_0$ and only diverges as $t \\to \\infty$. It does not exhibit a singularity at any finite time.\n\nConclusion: Finite-time blow-up (\"runaway SEI formation\") is not possible under the given model assumptions. The growth is self-limiting or \"passivating\" because as the SEI layer thickens, it increasingly restricts the diffusion of the reactant species to the reaction interface, thereby slowing down its own growth rate. The growth regime transitions from initially linear (reaction-limited for small $L$) to parabolic (diffusion-limited for large $L$).\n\nThe final answer requested is the expression for $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}$.",
