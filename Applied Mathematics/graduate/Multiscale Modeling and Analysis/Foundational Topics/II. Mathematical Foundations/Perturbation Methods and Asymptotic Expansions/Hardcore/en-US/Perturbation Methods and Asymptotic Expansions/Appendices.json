The equation is a simple cubic polynomial, whose properties are well-understood.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The equation is $f(x) = \\epsilon x^3 + x - 1 = 0$. The derivative is $f'(x) = 3\\epsilon x^2 + 1$. Since $\\epsilon > 0$, $f'(x) > 0$ for all real $x$. This means $f(x)$ is a strictly increasing function. As a continuous function that goes from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$, it must have exactly one real root. The existence of complex roots is guaranteed by the fundamental theorem of algebra. The problem is therefore well-posed.\n-   **Objectivity and Clarity**: The problem is stated in precise mathematical language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims. The tasks are clearly defined. The mention of the scaling $x=O(\\epsilon^{-1/3})$ and its potential inconsistency is a standard Socratic aporia used in teaching perturbation methods to encourage critical thinking about dominant balance.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed to construct the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem concerns the roots of the cubic equation $\\epsilon x^{3} + x - 1 = 0$ in the limit $\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}$.\n\n**1. Dominant Balance and Scaling Analysis**\n\nThe method of dominant balance involves determining which terms in the equation can be of leading order for different scalings of the variable $x$ with respect to $\\epsilon$. The equation has three terms: (I) $\\epsilon x^3$, (II) $x$, and (III) $-1$. A consistent balance requires that at least two terms are of the same, dominant order, while any neglected terms are asymptotically smaller.\n\n-   **Balance (II) and (III): $x \\sim 1$**\n    This balance implies that $x$ is of order unity, or $x = O(1)$. We check the magnitude of the neglected term (I):\n    -   Term (I): $\\epsilon x^3 = \\epsilon \\cdot O(1)^3 = O(\\epsilon)$.\n    -   Terms (II) and (III): $x = O(1)$ and $-1 = O(1)$.\n    Since $\\epsilon \\ll 1$, the neglected term $O(\\epsilon)$ is indeed much smaller than the balanced terms $O(1)$. This is a **consistent balance**. This scaling corresponds to a regular perturbation problem and will yield the real root, as for $\\epsilon=0$ the equation becomes $x-1=0$, with the root $x=1$.\n\n-   **Balance (I) and (III): $\\epsilon x^3 \\sim 1$**\n    This balance implies $\\epsilon x^3 = O(1)$, which gives $x^3 = O(\\epsilon^{-1})$ and thus $x = O(\\epsilon^{-1/3})$. This is one of the regimes the problem explicitly asks us to analyze. We check the magnitude of the neglected term (II):\n    -   Terms (I) and (III): $\\epsilon x^3 = O(1)$ and $-1 = O(1)$.\n    -   Term (II): $x = O(\\epsilon^{-1/3})$.\n    As $\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}$, the neglected term $O(\\epsilon^{-1/3})$ is asymptotically *larger* than the balanced terms $O(1)$. The balance cannot hold. This is an **inconsistent balance** and does not correspond to a valid asymptotic solution. This answers the question of why this regime is inconsistent: the term presumed to be subdominant, $x$, is in fact dominant. This holds for both real and complex values of $x$.\n\n-   **Balance (I) and (II): $\\epsilon x^3 \\sim -x$**\n    Assuming $x \\neq 0$, this balance gives $\\epsilon x^2 \\sim -1$, which implies $x^2 = O(\\epsilon^{-1})$ and thus $x = O(\\epsilon^{-1/2})$. We check the magnitude of the neglected term (III):\n    -   Terms (I) and (II): $\\epsilon x^3 = \\epsilon \\cdot O(\\epsilon^{-3/2}) = O(\\epsilon^{-1/2})$, and $x=O(\\epsilon^{-1/2})$.\n    -   Term (III): $-1=O(1)$.\n    As $\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}$, the balanced terms $O(\\epsilon^{-1/2})$ are asymptotically larger than the neglected term $O(1)$. This is a **consistent balance**. This scaling is singular and will describe the location of the two roots that diverge as $\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}$. Since the scaling implies $x^2 \\sim -1/\\epsilon$, these roots will be complex.\n\n**2. Regular Perturbation Expansion for the Real Root ($x=O(1)$)**\n\nBased on the dominant balance, the unique real root has the scaling $x=O(1)$. We posit a regular perturbation series for this root:\n$$ x(\\epsilon) = a_0 + a_1 \\epsilon + a_2 \\epsilon^2 + a_3 \\epsilon^3 + O(\\epsilon^4) $$\nSubstituting this into the equation $\\epsilon x^3 + x - 1 = 0$:\n$$ \\epsilon (a_0 + a_1 \\epsilon + a_2 \\epsilon^2 + \\dots)^3 + (a_0 + a_1 \\epsilon + a_2 \\epsilon^2 + a_3 \\epsilon^3 + \\dots) - 1 = 0 $$\nWe expand the cubic term and collect terms by powers of $\\epsilon$:\n$$ \\epsilon [a_0^3 + 3a_0^2 a_1 \\epsilon + (3a_0^2 a_2 + 3a_0 a_1^2)\\epsilon^2 + \\dots] + (a_0 + a_1 \\epsilon + a_2 \\epsilon^2 + a_3 \\epsilon^3) - 1 + O(\\epsilon^4) = 0 $$\n$$ (a_0 - 1) + (a_1 + a_0^3)\\epsilon + (a_2 + 3a_0^2 a_1)\\epsilon^2 + (a_3 + 3a_0^2 a_2 + 3a_0 a_1^2)\\epsilon^3 + O(\\epsilon^4) = 0 $$\nFor this equation to hold for all small $\\epsilon$, the coefficient of each power of $\\epsilon$ must be zero.\n\n-   **Order $\\epsilon^0$**:\n    $a_0 - 1 = 0 \\implies a_0 = 1$. This is the $O(1)$ approximation, $x \\approx 1$.\n\n-   **Order $\\epsilon^1$**:\n    $a_1 + a_0^3 = 0 \\implies a_1 + (1)^3 = 0 \\implies a_1 = -1$.\n\n-   **Order $\\epsilon^2$**:\n    $a_2 + 3a_0^2 a_1 = 0 \\implies a_2 + 3(1)^2(-1) = 0 \\implies a_2 - 3 = 0 \\implies a_2 = 3$.\n\n-   **Order $\\epsilon^3$**:\n    $a_3 + 3a_0^2 a_2 + 3a_0 a_1^2 = 0 \\implies a_3 + 3(1)^2(3) + 3(1)(-1)^2 = 0 \\implies a_3 + 9 + 3 = 0 \\implies a_3 = -12$.\n\nThe asymptotic expansion for the unique real root up to order $\\epsilon^3$ is:\n$$ x(\\epsilon) \\sim 1 - \\epsilon + 3\\epsilon^2 - 12\\epsilon^3 $$\n\n**3. Analysis of Non-Real Roots**\n\nAs shown in the dominant balance analysis, the scaling $x=O(\\epsilon^{-1/3})$ is inconsistent because it leads to the equation $O(1) + O(\\epsilon^{-1/3}) + O(1) = 0$, where the middle term dominates and is unbalanced.\n\nThe correct scaling for the non-real roots is $x = O(\\epsilon^{-1/2})$. To find their leading-order behavior, we introduce a rescaled variable $y$ such that $x = y/\\sqrt{\\epsilon} = y\\epsilon^{-1/2}$. Substituting this into the original equation:\n$$ \\epsilon(y\\epsilon^{-1/2})^3 + (y\\epsilon^{-1/2}) - 1 = 0 $$\n$$ \\epsilon(y^3\\epsilon^{-3/2}) + y\\epsilon^{-1/2} - 1 = 0 $$\n$$ y^3\\epsilon^{-1/2} + y\\epsilon^{-1/2} - 1 = 0 $$\nTo remove the singularity, we multiply the entire equation by $\\epsilon^{1/2}$:\n$$ y^3 + y - \\epsilon^{1/2} = 0 $$\nThis is now a regular perturbation problem for $y$ in the new small parameter $\\delta = \\epsilon^{1/2}$. Let $y(\\delta) = y_0 + y_1\\delta + O(\\delta^2)$.\nThe leading-order equation is obtained by setting $\\delta=0$ (or $\\epsilon=0$):\n$$ y_0^3 + y_0 = 0 \\implies y_0(y_0^2 + 1) = 0 $$\nThe solutions are $y_0 = 0$, $y_0 = i$, and $y_0 = -i$.\n-   The solution $y_0=0$ implies $x=0$, which does not satisfy the original equation $\\epsilon x^3 + x - 1 = -1 = 0$.\n-   The other two solutions, $y_0 = i$ and $y_0 = -i$, correspond to the two diverging roots.\n\nThus, the leading-order behavior of the non-real roots is given by $x \\sim y_0 \\epsilon^{-1/2}$:\n$$ x_{2,3} \\sim \\pm i \\epsilon^{-1/2} $$\nThese are the two large, complex-conjugate roots of the cubic equation.\n\nThe final answer required is the expansion for the unique real root. As derived in section 2, this is $x(\\epsilon) \\sim 1 - \\epsilon + 3\\epsilon^2 - 12\\epsilon^3$.",

Thus, as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, the term $-\\varepsilon u''(x)$ is asymptotically smaller than $u'(x)$. The reduced equation, obtained by setting $\\varepsilon=0$, governs the leading-order outer solution $u_{out}(x)$.\n$$u_{out}'(x) = 1$$\nIntegrating this first-order ODE yields\n$$u_{out}(x) = x + C_1$$\nwhere $C_1$ is an integration constant. This solution cannot satisfy both boundary conditions simultaneously, which indicates the presence of at least one boundary layer where the neglected term $-\\varepsilon u''(x)$ becomes significant.\n\n**Boundary Layer Analysis and Location**\n\nA boundary layer is a narrow region where the solution changes rapidly. In this region, the highest derivative term, which was neglected, becomes comparable to other terms in the equation. This is the principle of dominant balance. Let us investigate the possibility of a boundary layer at each endpoint.\n\nCase 1: Boundary layer at $x=0$.\nLet's introduce a stretched inner coordinate $X = x/\\delta(\\varepsilon)$. The derivatives transform as $\\frac{d}{dx} = \\frac{1}{\\delta}\\frac{d}{dX}$ and $\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} = \\frac{1}{\\delta^2}\\frac{d^2}{dX^2}$. Let $u(x) = U(X)$. The ODE becomes:\n$$-\\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\delta^2} \\frac{d^2U}{dX^2} + \\frac{1}{\\delta} \\frac{dU}{dX} = 1$$\nFor dominant balance between the two derivative terms, we must have $\\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\delta^2} \\sim \\frac{1}{\\delta}$, which implies $\\delta \\sim \\varepsilon$. We choose $\\delta=\\varepsilon$, so the inner variable is $X=x/\\varepsilon$. The ODE in the inner coordinate is:\n$$-\\frac{d^2U}{dX^2} + \\frac{dU}{dX} = \\varepsilon$$\nThe leading-order inner equation is obtained by setting $\\varepsilon=0$:\n$$-\\frac{d^2U_0}{dX^2} + \\frac{dU_0}{dX} = 0$$\nThe general solution is $U_0(X) = A + B\\exp(X)$. For a boundary layer to exist at $x=0$, the solution must be bounded as we move away from the boundary into the outer region, i.e., as $X \\to \\infty$. The term $\\exp(X)$ grows unboundedly as $X \\to \\infty$. This is not characteristic of a boundary layer phenomenon, which should be localized. Therefore, a boundary layer does not exist at $x=0$.\n\nCase 2: Boundary layer at $x=1$.\nWe introduce a stretched inner coordinate centered at $x=1$: $X = (1-x)/\\delta(\\varepsilon)$. The derivatives transform as $\\frac{d}{dx} = -\\frac{1}{\\delta}\\frac{d}{dX}$ and $\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} = \\frac{1}{\\delta^2}\\frac{d^2}{dX^2}$. Let $u(x)=U(X)$. The ODE becomes:\n$$-\\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\delta^2} \\frac{d^2U}{dX^2} - \\frac{1}{\\delta} \\frac{dU}{dX} = 1$$\nDominant balance between the two derivative terms requires $\\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\delta^2} \\sim \\frac{1}{\\delta}$, which again implies $\\delta \\sim \\varepsilon$. We set $\\delta=\\varepsilon$, so the inner variable is $X=(1-x)/\\varepsilon$. The ODE is:\n$$-\\frac{d^2U}{dX^2} - \\frac{dU}{dX} = \\varepsilon$$\nThe leading-order inner equation is:\n$$\\frac{d^2U_0}{dX^2} + \\frac{dU_0}{dX} = 0$$\nThe general solution is $U_0(X) = A + B\\exp(-X)$. As $X \\to \\infty$ (i.e., as $x$ moves away from $1$ into the interior), the term $\\exp(-X)$ decays to zero. This is consistent with a localized boundary layer. Thus, the boundary layer is located at $x=1$.\n\n**Determination of Solutions and Matching**\n\nThe outer solution $u_{out}(x) = x + C_1$ must be valid away from the boundary layer at $x=1$. Therefore, it should satisfy the boundary condition at the other end, $x=0$.\n$$u_{out}(0) = 0 \\implies 0 + C_1 = 0 \\implies C_1 = 0$$\nSo, the leading-order outer solution is\n$$u_{out}(x) = x$$\n\nThe leading-order inner solution is $U_0(X) = A + B\\exp(-X)$. It must satisfy the boundary condition at $x=1$, which is $u(1)=0$. In the inner coordinate, $x=1$ corresponds to $X=0$.\n$$U_0(0) = 0 \\implies A + B\\exp(0) = 0 \\implies A+B=0 \\implies B = -A$$\nSo, the inner solution takes the form $U_0(X) = A(1 - \\exp(-X))$.\n\nThe constant $A$ is determined by matching the inner and outer solutions. According to the Van Dyke matching principle, the long-range behavior of the inner solution must match the short-range behavior of the outer solution.\n$$\\lim_{X \\to \\infty} U_0(X) = \\lim_{x \\to 1} u_{out}(x)$$\nWe compute the limits:\n$$\\lim_{X \\to \\infty} A(1 - \\exp(-X)) = A(1-0) = A$$\n$$\\lim_{x \\to 1} x = 1$$\nMatching these values gives $A=1$.\nThus, the leading-order inner solution in terms of the inner variable $X$ is\n$$U_0(X) = 1 - \\exp(-X)$$\nSubstituting $X=(1-x)/\\varepsilon$, we get the inner solution in terms of the outer variable $x$:\n$$u_{in}(x) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1-x}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$$\n\n**Uniform Composite Approximation**\n\nA leading-order uniform composite approximation $u_{\\mathrm{comp}}(x)$ can be constructed by adding the outer and inner solutions and subtracting their common part to avoid double-counting. The common part, $u_{\\mathrm{common}}$, is the value found during matching.\n$$u_{\\mathrm{comp}}(x) = u_{out}(x) + u_{in}(x) - u_{\\mathrm{common}}(x)$$\nHere, $u_{out}(x) = x$, $u_{in}(x) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1-x}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$, and the common matching value is $u_{\\mathrm{common}} = 1$.\nSubstituting these into the formula:\n$$u_{\\mathrm{comp}}(x) = x + \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1-x}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\right) - 1$$\n$$u_{\\mathrm{comp}}(x) = x - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1-x}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$$\nThis expression serves as a uniformly valid approximation to the solution over the entire domain $0 \\le x \\le 1$.",

The solvability condition requires that the coefficients of these resonant terms on the right-hand side must be zero.\n\nLet us evaluate the terms on the right-hand side (RHS).\nFor the first term, we need the derivatives of $x_{0}$:\n$$\nD_{0} x_{0} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T_{0}} \\left[ a(T_{1}) \\cos(T_{0} + \\theta(T_{1})) \\right] = -a(T_{1}) \\sin(T_{0} + \\theta(T_{1}))\n$$\n$$\nD_{1} x_{0} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T_{1}} \\left[ a(T_{1}) \\cos(T_{0} + \\theta(T_{1})) \\right] = \\frac{da}{dT_{1}} \\cos(T_{0} + \\theta(T_{1})) - a(T_{1}) \\frac{d\\theta}{dT_{1}} \\sin(T_{0} + \\theta(T_{1}))\n$$\nUsing primes to denote differentiation with respect to $T_{1}$, i.e., $a' = da/dT_{1}$ and $\\theta' = d\\theta/dT_{1}$:\n$$\nD_{1} x_{0} = a' \\cos(T_{0} + \\theta) - a \\theta' \\sin(T_{0} + \\theta)\n$$\nNow we can compute $-2D_{0}D_{1}x_{0}$:\n$$\n-2 D_{0}D_{1}x_{0} = -2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T_{0}} \\left[ a' \\cos(T_{0} + \\theta) - a \\theta' \\sin(T_{0} + \\theta) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n-2 D_{0}D_{1}x_{0} = -2 \\left[ -a' \\sin(T_{0} + \\theta) - a \\theta' \\cos(T_{0} + \\theta) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n-2 D_{0}D_{1}x_{0} = 2a' \\sin(T_{0} + \\theta) + 2a\\theta' \\cos(T_{0} + \\theta)\n$$\nFor the second term, $x_{0}^3$, we use the trigonometric identity $\\cos^3(\\phi) = \\frac{3}{4}\\cos(\\phi) + \\frac{1}{4}\\cos(3\\phi)$:\n$$\nx_{0}^3 = \\left[ a \\cos(T_{0} + \\theta) \\right]^3 = a^3 \\cos^3(T_{0} + \\theta)\n$$\n$$\nx_{0}^3 = a^3 \\left[ \\frac{3}{4}\\cos(T_{0} + \\theta) + \\frac{1}{4}\\cos(3(T_{0} + \\theta)) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nx_{0}^3 = \\frac{3a^3}{4} \\cos(T_{0} + \\theta) + \\frac{a^3}{4} \\cos(3T_{0} + 3\\theta)\n$$\nNow, substitute these expressions back into the RHS of the equation for $x_{1}$:\n$$\n\\text{RHS} = \\left[ 2a' \\sin(T_{0} + \\theta) + 2a\\theta' \\cos(T_{0} + \\theta) \\right] + \\left[ \\frac{3a^3}{4}\\cos(T_{0} + \\theta) + \\frac{a^3}{4}\\cos(3T_{0} + 3\\theta) \\right]\n$$\nGroup the terms that are resonant (proportional to $\\cos(T_{0}+\\theta)$ and $\\sin(T_{0}+\\theta)$) and non-resonant:\n$$\n\\text{RHS} = \\left( 2a\\theta' + \\frac{3a^3}{4} \\right) \\cos(T_{0} + \\theta) + (2a') \\sin(T_{0} + \\theta) + \\frac{a^3}{4}\\cos(3T_{0} + 3\\theta)\n$$\nTo eliminate secular growth in $x_{1}$, the coefficients of the resonant terms must vanish. This gives two conditions:\n1.  The coefficient of $\\sin(T_{0} + \\theta)$ must be zero:\n    $$\n    2a' = 0 \\implies \\frac{da}{dT_{1}} = 0\n    $$\n2.  The coefficient of $\\cos(T_{0} + \\theta)$ must be zero:\n    $$\n    2a\\theta' + \\frac{3a^3}{4} = 0 \\implies \\frac{d\\theta}{dT_{1}} = -\\frac{3a^2}{8}\n    $$\nThe first equation is the envelope equation for the amplitude $a(T_{1})$. It shows that for the undamped Duffing equation, the amplitude of the leading-order oscillation is constant on the slow time scale. The second equation shows that the nonlinearity induces a slow, amplitude-dependent shift in the phase, which corresponds to a correction of the oscillation frequency.\n\nThe problem asks for the symbolic expression for the slow-time derivative of the amplitude $a(T_{1})$, which is $\\frac{da}{dT_{1}}$. From our derivation, this expression is $0$.",
