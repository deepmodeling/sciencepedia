            "solution": "The problem statement is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. We may proceed directly to the solution. The task is bifurcated: first, to derive the transformation law for a second-order tensor under a passive rotation, and second, to apply this law to compute a specific component of the provided stress tensor in a rotated frame.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Tensor Transformation Rule\n\nLet $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ be a second-order tensor, $\\mathbf{n}$ be a vector, and $\\mathbf{t}$ be the vector resulting from the linear mapping $\\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\mathbf{n}$. In a Cartesian frame $\\mathcal{S}$ with basis $\\{\\mathbf{e}_i\\}$, this relationship is expressed in terms of components as $t_i = \\sigma_{ij} n_j$, where the summation convention is implied over the repeated index $j$. In matrix notation, this is $[t]_{\\mathcal{S}} = [\\sigma]_{\\mathcal{S}} [n]_{\\mathcal{S}}$.\n\nConsider a second Cartesian frame $\\mathcal{S}'$, with basis $\\{\\mathbf{e}'_k\\}$, obtained by a passive rotation of $\\mathcal{S}$. The physical vectors $\\mathbf{t}$ and $\\mathbf{n}$, and the tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, are invariant entities. Their components, however, depend on the chosen basis. In the new frame, the relationship is $[t]_{\\mathcal{S}'} = [\\sigma]_{\\mathcal{S}'} [n]_{\\mathcal{S}'}$.\n\nThe transformation of vector components from frame $\\mathcal{S}$ to $\\mathcal{S}'$ under a passive rotation is given by a change-of-basis matrix $\\mathbf{Q}$, whose elements are $Q_{ij} = \\mathbf{e}'_i \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_j$. The components of any vector $\\mathbf{v}$ in the two frames are related by $[v]_{\\mathcal{S}'} = \\mathbf{Q} [v]_{\\mathcal{S}}$.\nThus, for vectors $\\mathbf{t}$ and $\\mathbf{n}$, we have:\n$$[t]_{\\mathcal{S}'} = \\mathbf{Q} [t]_{\\mathcal{S}}$$\n$$[n]_{\\mathcal{S}'} = \\mathbf{Q} [n]_{\\mathcal{S}}$$\nSince the basis transformation is orthonormal, the matrix $\\mathbf{Q}$ is orthogonal, meaning its inverse is its transpose: $\\mathbf{Q}^{-1} = \\mathbf{Q}^T$. We can express the components in the original frame in terms of the components in the new frame:\n$$[t]_{\\mathcal{S}} = \\mathbf{Q}^T [t]_{\\mathcal{S}'}$$\n$$[n]_{\\mathcal{S}} = \\mathbf{Q}^T [n]_{\\mathcal{S}'}$$\nNow, we substitute these into the defining relationship in the original frame $\\mathcal{S}$:\n$$[t]_{\\mathcal{S}} = [\\sigma]_{\\mathcal{S}} [n]_{\\mathcal{S}}$$\n$$\\mathbf{Q}^T [t]_{\\mathcal{S}'} = [\\sigma]_{\\mathcal{S}} (\\mathbf{Q}^T [n]_{\\mathcal{S}'})$$\nTo isolate $[t]_{\\mathcal{S}'}$, we pre-multiply both sides by $\\mathbf{Q}$:\n$$\\mathbf{Q} (\\mathbf{Q}^T [t]_{\\mathcal{S}'}) = \\mathbf{Q} [\\sigma]_{\\mathcal{S}} \\mathbf{Q}^T [n]_{\\mathcal{S}'}$$\n$$(\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{Q}^T) [t]_{\\mathcal{S}'} = (\\mathbf{Q} [\\sigma]_{\\mathcal{S}} \\mathbf{Q}^T) [n]_{\\mathcal{S}'}$$\nSince $\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{Q}^T = \\mathbf{I}$ (the identity matrix), we have:\n$$[t]_{\\mathcal{S}'} = (\\mathbf{Q} [\\sigma]_{\\mathcal{S}} \\mathbf{Q}^T) [n]_{\\mathcal{S}'}$$\nBy comparing this result with the definition in the new frame, $[t]_{\\mathcal{S}'} = [\\sigma]_{\\mathcal{S}'} [n]_{\\mathcal{S}'}$, we identify the transformation law for the components of the second-order tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$:\n$$[\\sigma]_{\\mathcal{S}'} = \\mathbf{Q} [\\sigma]_{\\mathcal{S}} \\mathbf{Q}^T$$\nThis is the required transformation rule in compact matrix form. In component (index) notation, this is written as:\n$$\\sigma'_{kl} = Q_{ki} \\sigma_{ij} (Q^T)_{jl} = Q_{ki} \\sigma_{ij} Q_{lj}$$\nwhere summation over $i$ and $j$ from $1$ to $3$ is implied. This completes the derivation.\n\nPart 2: Computation of the Shear Stress Component $\\sigma'_{12}$\n\nThe rotation is passive, about the $\\mathbf{e}_3$-axis by an angle $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$. The new basis vectors $\\{\\mathbf{e}'_1, \\mathbf{e}'_2, \\mathbf{e}'_3\\}$ are related to the old ones by:\n$$\\mathbf{e}'_1 = \\cos(\\theta) \\mathbf{e}_1 + \\sin(\\theta) \\mathbf{e}_2$$\n$$\\mathbf{e}'_2 = -\\sin(\\theta) \\mathbf{e}_1 + \\cos(\\theta) \\mathbf{e}_2$$\n$$\\mathbf{e}'_3 = \\mathbf{e}_3$$\nThe change-of-basis matrix $\\mathbf{Q}$ has components $Q_{ij} = \\mathbf{e}'_i \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_j$. With $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$, we have $\\cos(\\theta) = \\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nThe matrix $\\mathbf{Q}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{Q} = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos(\\theta)  \\sin(\\theta)  0 \\\\\n-\\sin(\\theta)  \\cos(\\theta)  0 \\\\\n0  0  1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}  0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}  0 \\\\\n0  0  1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe stress tensor components in frame $\\mathcal{S}$ are given as:\n$$\n[\\sigma]_{\\mathcal{S}} = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n10  2  1 \\\\\n2  4  -3 \\\\\n1  -3  5\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe seek the component $\\sigma'_{12}$. Using the component-wise transformation rule:\n$$\\sigma'_{12} = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\sum_{j=1}^3 Q_{1i} \\sigma_{ij} Q_{2j}$$\nThe non-zero elements of the first row of $\\mathbf{Q}$ are $Q_{11} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ and $Q_{12} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. The non-zero elements of the second row are $Q_{21} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ and $Q_{22} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. The summations thus reduce to four terms for $i,j \\in \\{1,2\\}$:\n$$\\sigma'_{12} = Q_{11}\\sigma_{11}Q_{21} + Q_{11}\\sigma_{12}Q_{22} + Q_{12}\\sigma_{21}Q_{21} + Q_{12}\\sigma_{22}Q_{22}$$\nSubstituting the values of the components of $\\mathbf{Q}$ and $[\\sigma]_{\\mathcal{S}}$:\n$$\\sigma'_{12} = (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})(10)(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}) + (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})(2)(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}) + (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})(2)(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}) + (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})(4)(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})$$\nThe calculation simplifies as follows:\n$$\\sigma'_{12} = -\\frac{10}{2} + \\frac{2}{2} - \\frac{2}{2} + \\frac{4}{2}$$\n$$\\sigma'_{12} = -5 + 1 - 1 + 2$$\n$$\\sigma'_{12} = -3$$\nAlternatively, one can use the established formula for the transformation of plane stress components:\n$$\\sigma'_{12} = \\frac{\\sigma_{22}-\\sigma_{11}}{2}\\sin(2\\theta) + \\sigma_{12}\\cos(2\\theta)$$\nGiven $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$, we have $2\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Therefore, $\\sin(2\\theta) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 1$ and $\\cos(2\\theta) = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 0$. The values for the stress components are $\\sigma_{11} = 10$, $\\sigma_{22} = 4$, and $\\sigma_{12}=2$.\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$\\sigma'_{12} = \\frac{4-10}{2}(1) + (2)(0)$$\n$$\\sigma'_{12} = \\frac{-6}{2} = -3$$\nBoth methods yield the same result.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe stress in the rotated macroscale frame, $\\sigma'$, is given by the constitutive relation $\\sigma' = C' : \\varepsilon'$, where $C'$ is the stiffness tensor in the macroscale frame and $\\varepsilon'$ is the strain tensor in that same frame. In component form, this is written as:\n$$\n\\sigma'_{ij} = C'_{ijkl} \\varepsilon'_{kl}\n$$\nWe are asked to find the component $\\sigma'_{11}$. Expanding the sum for $i=j=1$:\n$$\n\\sigma'_{11} = \\sum_{k=1}^3 \\sum_{l=1}^3 C'_{11kl} \\varepsilon'_{kl}\n$$\nThe problem states that the only non-zero component of the macroscale strain tensor is $\\varepsilon'_{11} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}$. Therefore, the sum simplifies significantly to:\n$$\n\\sigma'_{11} = C'_{1111} \\varepsilon'_{11}\n$$\nThe core of the problem is to determine the component $C'_{1111}$ of the rotated stiffness tensor. The transformation rule for a fourth-order tensor from the unprimed (crystal) frame to the primed (macroscale) frame is given by:\n$$\nC'_{ijkl} = \\sum_{m,n,p,q=1}^3 R_{im} R_{jn} R_{kp} R_{lq} C_{mnpq}\n$$\nwhere $R_{ij}$ are the components of the rotation matrix $R$. The matrix $R$ corresponds to a right-handed rotation by an angle $\\theta$ about the $\\mathbf{e}_3$ axis. Its components are given by:\n$$\n[R] = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta  \\sin\\theta  0 \\\\ -\\sin\\theta  \\cos\\theta  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo find $C'_{1111}$, we set $i=j=k=l=1$ in the transformation formula:\n$$\nC'_{1111} = \\sum_{m,n,p,q=1}^3 R_{1m} R_{1n} R_{1p} R_{1q} C_{mnpq}\n$$\nThe components of the first row of $R$ are $R_{11} = \\cos\\theta$, $R_{12} = \\sin\\theta$, and $R_{13} = 0$. Since $R_{13}$ is zero, any term in the sum where any of the indices $m, n, p, q$ is equal to $3$ will be zero. Thus, the sum is restricted to indices $1$ and $2$:\n$$\nC'_{1111} = \\sum_{m,n,p,q=1}^2 R_{1m} R_{1n} R_{1p} R_{1q} C_{mnpq}\n$$\nThe material properties given ($C_{1111}$, $C_{2222}$, $C_{1122}$, $C_{1212}$) correspond to a material with at least orthotropic symmetry. For such materials, any stiffness component $C_{mnpq}$ with an index appearing an odd number of times is zero (e.g., $C_{1112}=0$, $C_{1222}=0$). Therefore, we only need to consider terms where each index ($1$ or $2$) appears an even number of times (zero, two, or four times).\nLet $c = \\cos\\theta$ and $s = \\sin\\theta$. So, $R_{11} = c$ and $R_{12} = s$.\n\n1.  All indices are $1$: $(m, n, p, q) = (1, 1, 1, 1)$. The term is $(R_{11})^4 C_{1111} = c^4 C_{1111}$.\n2.  All indices are $2$: $(m, n, p, q) = (2, 2, 2, 2)$. The term is $(R_{12})^4 C_{2222} = s^4 C_{2222}$.\n3.  Two indices are $1$ and two are $2$: The coefficient is $(R_{11})^2(R_{12})^2 = c^2s^2$. We must sum over all permutations of the indices $(1,1,2,2)$. The terms are:\n    $C_{1122}$, $C_{1212}$, $C_{1221}$, $C_{2112}$, $C_{2121}$, $C_{2211}$.\n    Using the given minor and major symmetries ($C_{ijlk}=C_{ijkl}$, $C_{jikl}=C_{ijkl}$, $C_{klij}=C_{ijkl}$):\n    $C_{1221} = C_{1212}$, $C_{2112} = C_{1212}$, $C_{2121} = C_{1212}$, and $C_{2211} = C_{1122}$.\n    The sum of these components is $C_{1122} + C_{1212} + C_{1212} + C_{1212} + C_{1212} + C_{1122} = 2C_{1122} + 4C_{1212}$.\n    The total contribution from these terms is $c^2s^2(2C_{1122} + 4C_{1212})$.\n\nCombining these contributions, we obtain the expression for $C'_{1111}$:\n$$\nC'_{1111} = c^4 C_{1111} + s^4 C_{2222} + 2c^2s^2(C_{1122} + 2C_{1212})\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values. The angle is $\\theta = \\pi/6$.\n$c = \\cos(\\pi/6) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n$s = \\sin(\\pi/6) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$c^2 = \\frac{3}{4}$, $s^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$, $c^4 = \\frac{9}{16}$, $s^4 = \\frac{1}{16}$, $c^2s^2 = \\frac{3}{16}$.\nThe stiffness components are (in GPa):\n$C_{1111} = 190$, $C_{2222} = 60$, $C_{1122} = 15$, $C_{1212} = 40$.\n\nSubstitute these into the expression for $C'_{1111}$:\n$$\nC'_{1111} = \\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right)(190) + \\left(\\frac{1}{16}\\right)(60) + 2\\left(\\frac{3}{16}\\right)(15 + 2(40))\n$$\n$$\nC'_{1111} = \\frac{1}{16} [9(190) + 1(60) + 6(15 + 80)]\n$$\n$$\nC'_{1111} = \\frac{1}{16} [1710 + 60 + 6(95)]\n$$\n$$\nC'_{1111} = \\frac{1}{16} [1770 + 570]\n$$\n$$\nC'_{1111} = \\frac{2340}{16} = 146.25~\\text{GPa}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the stress component $\\sigma'_{11}$:\n$$\n\\sigma'_{11} = C'_{1111} \\varepsilon'_{11} = (146.25~\\text{GPa}) \\times (1.5 \\times 10^{-3})\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma'_{11} = 0.219375~\\text{GPa}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\sigma'_{11} \\approx 0.2194~\\text{GPa}\n$$",

In cylindrical coordinates $(x^1,x^2,x^3) = (r,\\theta,z)$, the line element is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}s^{2} = (1)\\,\\mathrm{d}r^{2} + (r^{2})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta^{2} + (1)\\,\\mathrm{d}z^{2}\n$$\nFrom this, we read the components of the metric tensor:\n$$\ng_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0 \\\\ 0  r^2  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of the metric tensor is $g = \\det(g_{ij}) = (1)(r^2)(1) = r^2$.\nThe square root of the determinant is thus $\\sqrt{g} = \\sqrt{r^2} = r$, assuming $r \\ge 0$ as is conventional for the radial coordinate. This term is also the product of the scale factors, $\\sqrt{g} = h_r h_\\theta h_z = (1)(r)(1)=r$.\n\nSubstituting $g=r^2$ and the specific coordinate names into the general divergence formula, we obtain the expression for divergence in cylindrical coordinates:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot V = \\frac{1}{r} \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r V^r\\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}\\left(r V^\\theta\\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\left(r V^z\\right) \\right]\n$$\nNow, we compute the terms in the square brackets using the given contravariant components $V^r$, $V^\\theta$, and $V^z$.\nThe products to be differentiated are:\n1.  $r V^r = r \\left( r\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right) \\right) = r^2\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$\n2.  $r V^\\theta = r \\left( \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right) \\right) = r\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$\n3.  $r V^z = r \\left( \\lambda\\,r^{2}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right) \\right) = \\lambda\\,r^3\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$\n\nNext, we take the partial derivatives:\n1.  $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r V^r) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r^2\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\right) = 2r\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$\n2.  $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}(r V^\\theta) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}\\left(r\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\right) = r\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{r}{\\varepsilon}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$\n3.  $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(r V^z) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\left(\\lambda\\,r^3\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\right) = \\lambda\\,r^3\\,\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right) \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{L}\\right) = -\\frac{\\lambda r^3}{L}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$\n\nSubstituting these results back into the divergence expression:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot V = \\frac{1}{r} \\left[ 2r\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right) + \\frac{r}{\\varepsilon}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right) - \\frac{\\lambda r^3}{L}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nDividing each term by $r$ and factoring out the common expression $\\exp(-z/L)\\cos(\\theta/\\varepsilon)$:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot V = 2\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right) - \\frac{\\lambda r^2}{L}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, we combine the coefficients into a single term:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot V = \\left(2 + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} - \\frac{\\lambda r^2}{L}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the divergence of the vector field, derived from first principles.\n\n### Verification using Physical Components\n\nTo verify this result, we use the standard divergence formula for cylindrical coordinates, which is expressed in terms of physical components. The physical components $(v_r, v_\\theta, v_z)$ are related to the contravariant components $(V^r, V^\\theta, V^z)$ via the scale factors $h_i = \\sqrt{g_{ii}}$ (no summation): $v_i = h_i V^i$.\n- $v_r = h_r V^r = (1) V^r = r\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$\n- $v_\\theta = h_\\theta V^\\theta = (r) V^\\theta = r\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$\n- $v_z = h_z V^z = (1) V^z = \\lambda\\,r^2\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$\n\nThe common divergence formula in cylindrical coordinates is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot V = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r v_r) + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial v_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z}\n$$\nLet's compute each term:\n- $\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r v_r) = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r \\cdot r\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r^2\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{1}{r}\\left(2r\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\right) = 2\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$\n- $\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial v_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta} = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}\\left(r\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{1}{r}\\left(r\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$\n- $\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\left(\\lambda\\,r^2\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\right) = \\lambda\\,r^2\\,\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{L}\\right) = -\\frac{\\lambda r^2}{L}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$\n\nSumming these three terms gives:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot V = 2\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right) - \\frac{\\lambda r^2}{L}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\n$$\nCombining the terms yields:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot V = \\left(2 + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} - \\frac{\\lambda r^2}{L}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{L}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\n$$\nThis result is identical to the one obtained from the fundamental definition, thus verifying the computation.",
