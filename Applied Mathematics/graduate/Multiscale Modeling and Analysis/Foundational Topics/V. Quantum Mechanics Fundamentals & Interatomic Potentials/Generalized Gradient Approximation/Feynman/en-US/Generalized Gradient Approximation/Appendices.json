This powerful \"non-empirical\" design philosophy is exemplified by the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. The following exercise  guides you through the derivation of the PBE exchange enhancement factor, showing how a few fundamental physical principles—like the recovery of the uniform gas limit and adherence to the Lieb-Oxford bound—give rise to its specific mathematical form.

The Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) constructs the exchange energy as an integral over a local enhancement of the Local Density Approximation (LDA). Let the exchange energy be written as\n$$\nE_{x}[n] = \\int n(\\mathbf{r})\\,\\varepsilon_{x}^{\\mathrm{LDA}}(n(\\mathbf{r}))\\,F_{x}(s(\\mathbf{r}))\\,d\\mathbf{r},\n$$\nwhere $n(\\mathbf{r})$ is the electron density, $\\varepsilon_{x}^{\\mathrm{LDA}}(n)$ is the LDA exchange energy per particle for the uniform electron gas, and $F_{x}(s)$ is a dimensionless exchange enhancement factor that depends on the reduced density gradient\n$$\ns = \\frac{|\\nabla n|}{2 k_{F} n}, \\quad k_{F} = (3\\pi^{2} n)^{1/3}.\n$$\nThe Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) form of the exchange enhancement $F_{x}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}(s)$ is constructed to obey the following nonempirical constraints:\n- Recovery of the Local Density Approximation (LDA) in the slowly varying limit: $F_{x}(s) \\to 1$ as $s \\to 0$.\n- Agreement with the second-order gradient expansion for exchange: $F_{x}(s) = 1 + \\mu s^{2} + \\mathcal{O}(s^{4})$ for small $s$, with a fixed coefficient $\\mu$.\n- Compliance with the Lieb–Oxford bound on the exchange–correlation energy, implemented for the exchange enhancement as an upper bound $F_{x}(s) \\leq 1 + \\kappa$ that is approached for large $s$, with a fixed parameter $\\kappa$.\n\nStarting from these constraints alone, derive a functional form $F_{x}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}(s)$ for the exchange enhancement that is rational in $s^{2}$, dimensionless, monotone increasing in $s$ for $s \\geq 0$, recovers the small-gradient expansion with coefficient $\\mu$, and saturates to $1+\\kappa$ as $s \\to \\infty$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a functional form for the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange enhancement factor, denoted as $F_{x}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}(s)$, based on a set of nonempirical constraints. Subsequently, this function is to be evaluated for a specific value of the reduced density gradient $s$.\n\nThe constraints for the exchange enhancement factor $F_{x}(s)$ are:\n1.  It is a rational function of $s^2$.\n2.  It recovers the Local Density Approximation (LDA) in the limit of a slowly varying electron gas: $F_{x}(s) \\to 1$ as $s \\to 0$.\n3.  It reproduces the second-order gradient expansion for small $s$: $F_{x}(s) = 1 + \\mu s^{2} + \\mathcal{O}(s^{4})$, where $\\mu$ is a constant.\n4.  It satisfies the Lieb–Oxford bound, which is implemented as an upper limit that is approached for large $s$: $F_{x}(s) \\to 1 + \\kappa$ as $s \\to \\infty$, where $\\kappa$ is a constant.\n5.  It is a monotone increasing function for $s \\geq 0$.\n\nLet's seek the simplest functional form that satisfies these conditions. Since $F_x(s)$ must be a rational function of $s^2$, let us define a variable $y = s^2$ and express $F_x(s)$ as a rational function $G(y)$. The simplest such form is a ratio of two polynomials.\n\nThe condition $F_{x}(s) \\to 1$ as $s \\to 0$ translates to $G(y) \\to 1$ as $y \\to 0$, which means $G(0)=1$.\nThe condition $F_x(s) \\to 1+\\kappa$ as $s \\to \\infty$ translates to $\\lim_{y\\to\\infty} G(y) = 1+\\kappa$. For a rational function, this implies that the degree of the numerator polynomial must equal the degree of the denominator polynomial. The limit is the ratio of their leading coefficients.\n\nLet us try the simplest case where both numerator and denominator are linear polynomials in $y$. To satisfy $G(0)=1$, we can write the function in the form:\n$$\nG(y) = \\frac{1+ay}{1+by}\n$$\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are constants to be determined.\n\nNow, we apply the remaining constraints.\nThe small-$s$ (and thus small-$y$) expansion is:\n$$\nG(y) = (1+ay)(1+by)^{-1} \\approx (1+ay)(1-by) = 1 + (a-b)y - aby^2 + \\dots\n$$\nComparing this to the required gradient expansion, $G(y) = 1 + \\mu y + \\mathcal{O}(y^2)$, we identify the coefficient of the linear term in $y$:\n$$\na - b = \\mu\n$$\nNext, we consider the large-$s$ (and thus large-$y$) limit:\n$$\n\\lim_{y\\to\\infty} G(y) = \\lim_{y\\to\\infty} \\frac{1+ay}{1+by} = \\frac{a}{b}\n$$\nAccording to the constraint from the Lieb–Oxford bound, this limit must be $1+\\kappa$:\n$$\n\\frac{a}{b} = 1+\\kappa\n$$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for the two unknown coefficients, $a$ and $b$:\n1. $a - b = \\mu$\n2. $a = (1+\\kappa)b$\n\nSubstitute the second equation into the first:\n$$\n(1+\\kappa)b - b = \\mu\n$$\n$$\nb + \\kappa b - b = \\mu\n$$\n$$\n\\kappa b = \\mu \\implies b = \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}\n$$\nNow, substitute the expression for $b$ back into the equation for $a$:\n$$\na = (1+\\kappa)b = (1+\\kappa)\\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}\n$$\nSubstituting these coefficients back into our trial function $G(y)$, we get:\n$$\nG(y) = \\frac{1 + \\frac{\\mu(1+\\kappa)}{\\kappa}y}{1 + \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}y}\n$$\nReplacing $y$ with $s^2$, we obtain the functional form for the PBE exchange enhancement factor:\n$$\nF_{x}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}(s) = \\frac{1 + \\frac{\\mu(1+\\kappa)}{\\kappa}s^2}{1 + \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}s^2}\n$$\nThis form can be rewritten for easier interpretation. By performing polynomial division or algebraic manipulation:\n$$\nF_{x}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}(s) = \\frac{1 + \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}s^2 + \\mu s^2}{1 + \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}s^2} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}s^2}{1 + \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}s^2} + \\frac{\\mu s^2}{1 + \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}s^2} = 1 + \\frac{\\mu s^2}{1 + \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}s^2}\n$$\nThis is the standard form for the PBE exchange enhancement factor.\n\nFinally, we must check the monotonicity condition. We need to verify that $\\frac{dF_{x}}{ds} \\geq 0$ for $s \\geq 0$. We compute the derivative of $F_{x}(s)$ with respect to $s$:\n$$\n\\frac{dF_{x}}{ds} = \\frac{d}{ds}\\left(1 + \\frac{\\mu s^2}{1 + \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}s^2}\\right) = \\frac{ (2\\mu s)\\left(1 + \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}s^2\\right) - (\\mu s^2)\\left(2\\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}s\\right) }{ \\left(1 + \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}s^2\\right)^2 }\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dF_{x}}{ds} = \\frac{ 2\\mu s + \\frac{2\\mu^2}{\\kappa}s^3 - \\frac{2\\mu^2}{\\kappa}s^3 }{ \\left(1 + \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}s^2\\right)^2 } = \\frac{2\\mu s}{\\left(1 + \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}s^2\\right)^2}\n$$\nThe problem provides a numerical value for $\\mu = 0.21951$, which is positive. The denominator is a square and is therefore always non-negative. For $s \\geq 0$, the numerator $2\\mu s$ is also non-negative. Thus, $\\frac{dF_x}{ds} \\geq 0$ for $s \\geq 0$, and the function is monotone increasing as required.\n\nNow we proceed with the numerical calculation. We are asked to compute $F_{x}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}(s)$ for $s=2$, using the parameters $\\mu=0.21951$ and $\\kappa=0.804$.\nUsing the derived formula:\n$$\nF_{x}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}(2) = 1 + \\frac{\\mu (2^2)}{1 + \\frac{\\mu}{\\kappa}(2^2)} = 1 + \\frac{4\\mu}{1 + \\frac{4\\mu}{\\kappa}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nF_{x}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}(2) = 1 + \\frac{4(0.21951)}{1 + \\frac{4(0.21951)}{0.804}}\n$$\n$$\nF_{x}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}(2) = 1 + \\frac{0.87804}{1 + \\frac{0.87804}{0.804}}\n$$\nFirst, calculate the term inside the denominator:\n$$\n\\frac{0.87804}{0.804} \\approx 1.09208955...\n$$\nNow, substitute this back into the main expression:\n$$\nF_{x}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}(2) \\approx 1 + \\frac{0.87804}{1 + 1.09208955} = 1 + \\frac{0.87804}{2.09208955}\n$$\n$$\nF_{x}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}(2) \\approx 1 + 0.41969300...\n$$\n$$\nF_{x}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}(2) \\approx 1.41969300...\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $1.420$.\n\nThe relative enhancement beyond LDA is given by $F_{x}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}(s)-1$. For $s=2$, this value is $F_{x}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}(2)-1 \\approx 0.4197$. This signifies that for a region with a reduced density gradient of $s=2$, the PBE approximation for the exchange energy density is about $42\\%$ larger than the LDA prediction. This is a substantial correction, underscoring the physical importance of including density gradient information to improve upon the LDA, which is strictly valid only for a uniform electron gas ($s=0$).",

The reduced density gradient, $s(\\mathbf{r})$, is a dimensionless quantity that measures the local inhomogeneity of the electron gas. It is defined as:\n$$\ns(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{|\\nabla n(\\mathbf{r})|}{2 k_{\\mathrm{F}}(\\mathbf{r}) n(\\mathbf{r})}\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla n(\\mathbf{r})$ is the gradient of the electron density $n(\\mathbf{r})$, and $k_{\\mathrm{F}}(\\mathbf{r})$ is the local Fermi wavevector.\n\nThe local Fermi wavevector, $k_{\\mathrm{F}}(\\mathbf{r})$, is defined by treating the electron gas at position $\\mathbf{r}$ as a homogeneous electron gas with density $n(\\mathbf{r})$.

The reduced gradient starts at $s(0)=0$ and increases linearly with $r$. This is physically correct, as at the center of a symmetric distribution, the gradient is zero, implying zero inhomogeneity.\nFor large $r$ ($r \\to \\infty$): Both the linear term $r$ and the exponential term $\\exp(\\frac{\\alpha r^2}{3})$ go to infinity. The exponential term dominates, causing $s(r)$ to grow extremely rapidly. This indicates that the tail of the electron distribution is a region of very high inhomogeneity, where the density changes rapidly on the scale of the local Fermi wavelength.\n\n$2$. Dependence on $\\alpha$: The parameter $\\alpha$ controls the localization of the density; a larger $\\alpha$ corresponds to a more sharply peaked, localized distribution. For any fixed radius $r > 0$, the function $s(r)$ is an increasing function of $\\alpha$. This is because both the prefactor $\\alpha$ and the argument of the exponential, $\\frac{\\alpha r^2}{3}$, increase with $\\alpha$. This aligns with the physical intuition that a more rapidly changing density profile (larger $\\alpha$) corresponds to a greater degree of inhomogeneity.\n\n$3$. Dependence on $n_0$: The quantity $s(r)$ is proportional to $n_0^{-1/3}$. Increasing the peak density $n_0$ while keeping the shape parameter $\\alpha$ fixed leads to a decrease in the reduced gradient $s$ at all points $r$. This reflects the fact that in regions of higher electron density, the system behaves more like a homogeneous electron gas, and thus the same absolute gradient $|\\nabla n|$ is considered less significant.",
