This exercise provides a foundational practice by connecting the abstract idea of electron density to the concrete geometry of a crystal lattice.

            "problem": "Consider a perfect monatomic face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal with lattice parameter $a$ at zero temperature. In the Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM), the embedding energy of an atom at site $i$ is expressed as a function of a background electron density $\\rho_i$ at that site, which is constructed from contributions of neighboring atoms. Assume the following physically standard conditions:\n\n- The atomic electron density associated with a single isolated atom is spherically symmetric and strictly radially decaying, denoted $\\rho_a(r)$, where $r$ is the scalar separation from the atom.\n- The environment is an ideal fcc lattice without defects or occlusion, so that screening effects between neighbors can be neglected (i.e., the screening factor is unity).\n- Only the nearest-neighbor shell is to be included in the construction of $\\rho_i$, and angular-dependent contributions can be neglected based on the cubic symmetry and the spherically symmetric form of $\\rho_a(r)$.\n\nStarting from the core MEAM concept that the background electron density $\\rho_i$ at site $i$ is constructed by summing spherically symmetric atomic electron density contributions from neighboring atoms, compute the closed-form analytic expression for $\\rho_i$ in terms of $a$ and $\\rho_a(r)$ by using only the nearest-neighbor shell of the fcc lattice. Your final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression. No numerical approximation is required, and no units need to be reported.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for a closed-form analytic expression for the background electron density, $\\rho_i$, at an atomic site $i$ within a perfect face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal. The calculation is to be performed under the framework of the Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM), simplified to include only contributions from the nearest-neighbor shell and neglecting angular-dependent terms.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the background electron density $\\rho_i$ at site $i$ is constructed by the linear superposition of spherically symmetric atomic electron density contributions, $\\rho_a(r)$, from its neighboring atoms. Given the instruction to consider only the nearest-neighbor shell, the expression for $\\rho_i$ is:\n$$\n\\rho_i = \\sum_{j \\in \\text{NN}(i)} \\rho_a(r_{ij})\n$$\nwhere $\\text{NN}(i)$ is the set of nearest neighbors to atom $i$, and $r_{ij}$ is the distance between atom $i$ and its neighbor $j$.\n\nFor a perfect crystal structure, every atom is in an identical environment. Therefore, we can place our reference atom, $i$, at the origin of a coordinate system without loss of generality. In a perfect lattice, all nearest neighbors are at the same distance, which we will denote as $r_{\\text{NN}}$. The number of these nearest neighbors is the first coordination number of the lattice, which we denote as $Z_{\\text{NN}}$.\n\nThe summation can thus be simplified. Since $\\rho_a(r_{ij}) = \\rho_a(r_{\\text{NN}})$ for all $j \\in \\text{NN}(i)$, the sum becomes a product:\n$$\n\\rho_i = Z_{\\text{NN}} \\cdot \\rho_a(r_{\\text{NN}})\n$$\nTo proceed, we must determine the values of $Z_{\\text{NN}}$ and $r_{\\text{NN}}$ for the fcc lattice structure in terms of its lattice parameter, $a$.\n\nThe conventional unit cell of an fcc lattice is a cube of side length $a$ with atoms at the $8$ corners and at the center of the $6$ faces. Let's place a reference atom at the origin, coordinates $(0, 0, 0)$. The positions of its neighbors can be identified.\n\nThe atoms at the corners of the cube are at positions like $(a, 0, 0)$, $(0, a, 0)$, etc. The distance to these atoms is $a$.\nThe atoms at the centers of the faces are at positions like $(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, 0)$, $(\\frac{a}{2}, 0, \\frac{a}{2})$, $(0, \\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2})$, and their permutations with signs. The distance from the origin to an atom at $(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, 0)$ is:\n$$\nr = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{4} + \\frac{a^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2a^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{2}} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nWe must compare this distance to the distance to the corner atoms, which is $a$. Since $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 0.707$, we have $\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} < a$. Therefore, the face-centered atoms are the nearest neighbors to a corner atom. The nearest-neighbor distance is:\n$$\nr_{\\text{NN}} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nNext, we determine the coordination number, $Z_{\\text{NN}}$. For a reference atom at the origin, the nearest neighbors are the atoms on the faces of the cubes that meet at this corner. There are $12$ such face centers at the correct distance. Their coordinates relative to the origin are given by all non-zero permutations of $(\\pm \\frac{a}{2}, \\pm \\frac{a}{2}, 0)$. These are:\n- In the $xy$-plane: $(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, 0)$, $(\\frac{a}{2}, -\\frac{a}{2}, 0)$, $(-\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, 0)$, $(-\\frac{a}{2}, -\\frac{a}{2}, 0)$. This is $4$ neighbors.\n- In the $xz$-plane: $(\\frac{a}{2}, 0, \\frac{a}{2})$, $(\\frac{a}{2}, 0, -\\frac{a}{2})$, $(-\\frac{a}{2}, 0, \\frac{a}{2})$, $(-\\frac{a}{2}, 0, -\\frac{a}{2})$. This is $4$ neighbors.\n- In the $yz$-plane: $(0, \\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2})$, $(0, \\frac{a}{2}, -\\frac{a}{2})$, $(0, -\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2})$, $(0, -\\frac{a}{2}, -\\frac{a}{2})$. This is $4$ neighbors.\n\nSumming these up gives a total of $4 + 4 + 4 = 12$ nearest neighbors. Thus, the first coordination number for the fcc lattice is:\n$$\nZ_{\\text{NN}} = 12\n$$\nNow, we can substitute the derived values for $Z_{\\text{NN}}$ and $r_{\\text{NN}}$ back into our expression for $\\rho_i$:\n$$\n\\rho_i = Z_{\\text{NN}} \\cdot \\rho_a(r_{\\text{NN}}) = 12 \\cdot \\rho_a\\left(\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression represents the zeroth-order background electron density at any atomic site in a perfect fcc crystal, based on the simplified MEAM assumptions provided. The neglect of angular contributions is justified by the high symmetry of the nearest-neighbor shell in the fcc lattice, which would cause the first-order angularly dependent terms in the full MEAM to sum to zero. The MEAM screening factor modifies the pair potential term in the total energy expression, not the construction of the background electron density. Therefore, it is not relevant to this specific calculation.",

            "solution": "The problem asks to identify the correct form of a smooth cutoff function $f_c(r)$ and the physical justification for its required level of continuity in the context of MEAM molecular dynamics simulations, particularly concerning the calculation of phonon spectra.\n\nThe connection between the smoothness of the cutoff function $f_c(r)$ and the physicality of the phonon spectrum is established through the hierarchy of derivatives of the total potential energy $U$.\n\n1.  **Potential Energy ($U$):** For energy to be conserved, the potential must be continuous ($C^0$). A discontinuity in $U$ at the cutoff radius $r_c$ would imply an infinite force. This requires $f_c(r_c) = 0$.\n\n2.  **Forces ($\\mathbf{F}$):** In molecular dynamics, forces are the negative gradient of the potential ($\\mathbf{F}_i = -\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_i} U$), involving the first derivative of $U$. A discontinuous force would cause infinite accelerations and simulation instability. To ensure the force is continuous and goes smoothly to zero at the cutoff, the potential energy $U$ must be continuously differentiable ($C^1$). This requires both $f_c(r_c) = 0$ and $f_c'(r_c) = 0$.\n\n3.  **Hessian Matrix and Phonons:** Small-amplitude atomic vibrations (phonons) are analyzed by linearizing the equations of motion. This leads to an eigenvalue problem for the dynamical matrix, which is constructed from the Hessian (or force-constant) matrix, whose elements are the second derivatives of the potential energy, $H_{\\alpha\\beta}^{ij} = \\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial r_{i\\alpha} \\partial r_{j\\beta}}$. The eigenvalues are related to the squared frequencies of the phonon modes ($\\omega^2$). For a physically meaningful phonon spectrum, the Hessian matrix must be continuous. A discontinuity would mean the effective spring constant between atoms jumps as they vibrate across the cutoff distance, creating spurious high-frequency modes and degrading energy conservation. To ensure a continuous Hessian, the potential energy $U$ must be twice continuously differentiable ($C^2$). This requires that the second derivative of the cutoff function, $f_c''(r)$, also goes to zero at the cutoff.

The justification correctly links $C^2$ continuity to the Hessian and the avoidance of spurious phonons. This option is correct.\n\n**B:** The function is $h(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\cos(\\pi x))$.\n- $h(1) = 0$.\n- $h'(1) = 0$.\n- $h''(x) = -\\frac{\\pi^2}{2}\\cos(\\pi x) \\implies h''(1) = \\frac{\\pi^2}{2} \\neq 0$.\nThe function is only $C^1$, not $C^2$. The justification that $C^1$ is sufficient is incorrect for phonon calculations.\n\n**C:** The function is $h(x) = 1 - 3x^2 + 2x^3$.\n- $h(1) = 0$.\n- $h'(1) = 0$.\n- $h''(x) = -6 + 12x \\implies h''(1) = 6 \\neq 0$.\nThe function is only $C^1$, not $C^2$. The justification that $C^1$ is sufficient is incorrect.\n\n**D:** The function is $\\exp(-(r-r_s)/(r_c-r_s))$. At $r=r_c$, this evaluates to $\\exp(-1)$, while it is defined as $0$ for $r \\ge r_c$. The function is not even continuous ($C^0$). The justification is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, option A is the only one that provides both a mathematically correct $C^2$ function and the correct physical reasoning for why $C^2$ continuity is necessary.",
