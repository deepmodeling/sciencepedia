            "problem": "A homogeneous, isotropic polycrystalline metal is modeled at the macroscale by a small-strain elastoplastic constitutive law that is the homogenized result of the underlying microstructure. Assume the following standard ingredients: the additive strain decomposition $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon^{e} + \\varepsilon^{p}$, linear isotropic elasticity with Hooke’s law in one dimension $\\sigma = E\\varepsilon^{e}$, and an associated flow rule governed by the von Mises (second invariant of the stress deviator, often denoted $J_{2}$) yield criterion specialized to uniaxial stress, with a perfectly plastic response after yielding (no hardening). The yield function reduces under uniaxial tension to $f(\\sigma) = |\\sigma| - \\sigma_{y}$, where $\\sigma_{y} > 0$ is the yield stress. The loading is monotonic tension and the material is initially undeformed and unstressed.\n\nYou are given the following macroscopic parameters and loading:\n- Elastic modulus $E = 210 \\times 10^{9}$, expressed in Pascals.\n- Yield stress $\\sigma_{y} = 350 \\times 10^{6}$, expressed in Pascals.\n- Applied total strain $\\varepsilon = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ (unitless), imposed quasi-statically under displacement control.\n\nStarting from the stated fundamental definitions and laws, derive the operative conditions for elastic versus plastic response, and then obtain the resulting plastic strain $\\varepsilon^{p}$ under the given loading.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the plastic strain in a metallic material under a specified total strain, based on a one-dimensional, small-strain, perfectly elastoplastic constitutive model. The solution proceeds by first determining whether the applied load is sufficient to cause plastic deformation and then computing the magnitude of this deformation.\n\nThe fundamental relationships provided are:\n1.  Additive decomposition of total strain ($\\varepsilon$) into elastic ($\\varepsilon^e$) and plastic ($\\varepsilon^p$) components:\n    $$ \\varepsilon = \\varepsilon^e + \\varepsilon^p $$\n2.  Linear elastic stress-strain relationship (Hooke's Law):\n    $$ \\sigma = E \\varepsilon^e $$\n    where $\\sigma$ is the uniaxial stress and $E$ is the elastic modulus.\n3.  The yield criterion for uniaxial tension, which defines the elastic domain:\n    $$ f(\\sigma) = |\\sigma| - \\sigma_y \\leq 0 $$\n    For monotonic tension, the stress $\\sigma$ is non-negative, so this simplifies to $\\sigma \\leq \\sigma_y$, where $\\sigma_y$ is the yield stress. The material response is perfectly plastic, meaning there is no strain hardening, and the stress cannot exceed $\\sigma_y$.\n\nFirst, we establish the condition for the onset of plasticity. The material behaves elastically as long as the stress $\\sigma$ is less than or equal to the yield stress $\\sigma_y$. In the elastic regime, the plastic strain $\\varepsilon^p = 0$, so the total strain equals the elastic strain, $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon^e$. The stress is then directly proportional to the total strain: $\\sigma = E \\varepsilon$.\n\nYielding begins at the precise moment the stress reaches the yield stress. The total strain at this point is called the yield strain, denoted $\\varepsilon_y$. We can calculate it as:\n$$ \\sigma_y = E \\varepsilon_y \\implies \\varepsilon_y = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{E} $$\nSubstituting the given values, $E = 210 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{Pa}$ and $\\sigma_y = 350 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{Pa}$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_y = \\frac{350 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{Pa}}{210 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{Pa}} = \\frac{350}{210000} = \\frac{1}{600} $$\nNumerically, this represents a yield strain of $\\varepsilon_y \\approx 1.667 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n\nThe applied total strain is given as $\\varepsilon = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}$. We compare the applied strain to the yield strain:\n$$ 5.0 \\times 10^{-3} > \\frac{1}{600} \\approx 1.667 \\times 10^{-3} $$\nSince the applied strain $\\varepsilon$ is greater than the yield strain $\\varepsilon_y$, the material has yielded and undergone plastic deformation. Therefore, $\\varepsilon^p > 0$.\n\nAs requested, we can demonstrate the onset of plasticity by calculating the hypothetical stress that would be present if the material response were purely elastic up to the applied strain $\\varepsilon$. Let's call this hypothetical stress $\\sigma_{elastic}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{elastic} = E \\varepsilon = (210 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{Pa}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-3}) = 1050 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{Pa} = 1050 \\, \\text{MPa} $$\nThis hypothetical stress of $1050 \\, \\text{MPa}$ is significantly greater than the material's yield stress $\\sigma_y = 350 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{Pa} = 350 \\, \\text{MPa}$. This confirms that a purely elastic response is physically impossible under the given conditions. The material must yield to ensure the stress does not exceed $\\sigma_y$.\n\nFor a perfectly plastic material, once yielding occurs, the stress remains constant at the yield stress $\\sigma_y$ during any subsequent plastic deformation. Thus, the actual stress in the material is:\n$$ \\sigma = \\sigma_y = 350 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{Pa} $$\nWith the stress known, we can determine the elastic component of the total strain using Hooke's Law:\n$$ \\varepsilon^e = \\frac{\\sigma}{E} = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{E} = \\varepsilon_y = \\frac{1}{600} $$\nNow, we can find the plastic strain $\\varepsilon^p$ by rearranging the additive strain decomposition formula:\n$$ \\varepsilon^p = \\varepsilon - \\varepsilon^e $$\nSubstituting the known values for the total strain $\\varepsilon$ and the calculated elastic strain $\\varepsilon^e$:\n$$ \\varepsilon^p = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3} - \\frac{\\sigma_y}{E} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3} - \\frac{1}{600} $$\nTo compute the value, we can use fractions:\n$$ \\varepsilon^p = \\frac{5}{1000} - \\frac{1}{600} = \\frac{1}{200} - \\frac{1}{600} = \\frac{3}{600} - \\frac{1}{600} = \\frac{2}{600} = \\frac{1}{300} $$\nAs a decimal, $\\varepsilon^p = \\frac{1}{300} \\approx 0.0033333...$. The problem requires rounding this result to four significant figures. The first significant figure is the first $3$. Thus, the value becomes $0.003333$.",

            "solution": "The Cauchy stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, can be uniquely decomposed into a volumetric (or hydrostatic) part, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{\\text{vol}}$, and a deviatoric part, $\\boldsymbol{s}$.

The relationship is expressed as:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{\\text{vol}} + \\boldsymbol{s}\n$$\nThe volumetric part is defined by the mean (or hydrostatic) stress, $\\sigma_m$, which is the average of the normal stress components.

This can be explained from both continuum and micromechanical first principles.\n\nFrom a continuum mechanics perspective, plastic deformation is an isochoric (volume-preserving) process involving permanent shape change. The volumetric stress, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{\\text{vol}}$, causes only elastic volume changes (dilatation) and does not contribute to distortion. Conversely, the deviatoric stress, $\\boldsymbol{s}$, is solely responsible for distortional deformation. Since plastic flow is a distortional phenomenon, it is axiomatically linked to the deviatoric stress. Experimental evidence for metals shows that the onset of yielding is largely independent of the applied hydrostatic pressure, which validates this continuum-level assumption.\n\nFrom a micromechanical perspective, plastic deformation in crystalline metals occurs through the motion of dislocations, a process known as slip. Slip is fundamentally a shearing mechanism, where crystal planes slide relative to one another. For a dislocation to move, the resolved shear stress on its slip system (a combination of a slip plane and a slip direction) must reach a critical value, $\\tau_{\\text{crss}}$. A purely volumetric (hydrostatic) stress state, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{\\text{vol}} = \\sigma_m \\boldsymbol{I}$, produces a traction vector on any plane with normal $\\boldsymbol{n}$ given by $\\boldsymbol{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{\\text{vol}}\\boldsymbol{n} = \\sigma_m \\boldsymbol{I} \\boldsymbol{n} = \\sigma_m \\boldsymbol{n}$. This traction vector is parallel to the plane's normal, meaning it is a purely normal stress with no shear component. Since hydrostatic stress cannot generate shear stress, it cannot activate dislocation glide. Therefore, plastic yielding via slip is insensitive to the volumetric part of the stress tensor. It is the deviatoric stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{s}$, which encapsulates all differences in normal stresses and all shear stresses, that generates the resolved shear stresses necessary to drive dislocation motion and thus cause plastic flow.\n\nFinally, we compute the von Mises equivalent stress, $\\sigma_v$, a scalar measure of the deviatoric stress state's magnitude. It is used in the von Mises yield criterion to predict the onset of plastic deformation in ductile materials. The von Mises stress can be calculated directly from the components of the Cauchy stress tensor:\n$$\n\\sigma_v = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} [(\\sigma_{11} - \\sigma_{22})^2 + (\\sigma_{22} - \\sigma_{33})^2 + (\\sigma_{33} - \\sigma_{11})^2] + 3(\\sigma_{12}^2 + \\sigma_{23}^2 + \\sigma_{31}^2)}\n$$\nSubstituting the given stress components (in $\\mathrm{MPa}$):\n$$\n\\sigma_v^2 = \\frac{1}{2} [(320 - 280)^2 + (280 - 260)^2 + (260 - 320)^2] + 3(50^2 + 40^2 + (-30)^2)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_v^2 = \\frac{1}{2} [40^2 + 20^2 + (-60)^2] + 3(2500 + 1600 + 900)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_v^2 = \\frac{1}{2} [1600 + 400 + 3600] + 3(5000)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_v^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (5600) + 15000\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_v^2 = 2800 + 15000 = 17800 \\, (\\mathrm{MPa})^2\n$$\nThe von Mises equivalent stress is the square root of this value:\n$$\n\\sigma_v = \\sqrt{17800} \\, \\mathrm{MPa} \\approx 133.41664 \\, \\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$\n\\sigma_v \\approx 133.4 \\, \\mathrm{MPa}\n$$",

Taking the equivalent stress norm of the rearranged equation $\\boldsymbol{s}^{\\text{trial}} = \\boldsymbol{s}_{n+1} (1 + \\frac{3G\\Delta\\lambda}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq},n+1}})$ yields:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{\\text{trial}} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq},n+1} \\left(1 + \\frac{3G\\Delta\\lambda}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq},n+1}}\\right) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq},n+1} + 3G\\Delta\\lambda\n$$\nThe consistency condition is $f_{n+1}=0$, which means $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq},n+1} - \\sigma_{y0} - H\\kappa_{n+1} = 0$.\nWith $\\kappa_{n+1} = \\kappa_n + \\Delta\\kappa = 0 + \\Delta\\lambda$, we have $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq},n+1} = \\sigma_{y0} + H\\Delta\\lambda$.\nSubstitute this into the equation for $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{\\text{trial}}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{\\text{trial}} = (\\sigma_{y0} + H\\Delta\\lambda) + 3G\\Delta\\lambda = \\sigma_{y0} + (3G+H)\\Delta\\lambda\n$$\nSolving for $\\Delta\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\lambda = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{\\text{trial}} - \\sigma_{y0}}{3G+H} = \\frac{f^{\\text{trial}}}{3G+H}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n$$\nf^{\\text{trial}} = \\frac{550}{13} \\, \\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\n$$\n3G+H = 3\\left(\\frac{1050000}{13}\\right) + 1500 = \\frac{3150000}{13} + \\frac{1500 \\times 13}{13} = \\frac{3150000 + 19500}{13} = \\frac{3169500}{13} \\, \\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\nFinally, we compute $\\Delta\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\lambda = \\frac{\\frac{550}{13}}{\\frac{3169500}{13}} = \\frac{550}{3169500} = \\frac{55}{316950} = \\frac{11}{63390}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\n\\Delta\\lambda \\approx 0.0001735289...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\Delta\\lambda \\approx 0.0001735\n$$\nThis value is dimensionless, consistent with its interpretation as an equivalent plastic strain increment.",
