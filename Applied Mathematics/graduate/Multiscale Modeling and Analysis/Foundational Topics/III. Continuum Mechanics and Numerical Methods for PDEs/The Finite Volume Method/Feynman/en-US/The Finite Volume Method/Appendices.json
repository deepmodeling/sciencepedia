The species undergoes a first-order chemical reaction, leading to a source/sink term $S$ that is a linear function of the local concentration:\n$$\nS = S_C + S_P \\phi\n$$\nHere, $S_C$ and $S_P$ are constant coefficients.\n\nThe channel extends from $x=0$ to $x=L$. The concentrations at the boundaries are held constant at known values: $\\phi(0) = \\phi_A$ and $\\phi(L) = \\phi_B$.\n\nTo solve for the concentration profile, the domain is discretized into a uniform grid with five equally-spaced nodes: $x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$, where $x_0=0$ and $x_4=L$.
