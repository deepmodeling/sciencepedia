The type of the PDE (elliptic, hyperbolic, or parabolic) corresponds to the signature of this quadratic form. This signature is determined by the sign of the discriminant, defined as $\\Delta(x,y) = B(x,y)^2 - A(x,y)C(x,y)$.\n\nThe classification rules are as follows:\n1.  The PDE is **elliptic** at a point $(x,y)$ if $\\Delta(x,y)  0$. This corresponds to the quadratic form being positive-definite or negative-definite.\n2.  The PDE is **hyperbolic** at a point $(x,y)$ if $\\Delta(x,y)  0$. This corresponds to the quadratic form being indefinite.\n3.  The PDE is **parabolic** at a point $(x,y)$ if $\\Delta(x,y) = 0$. This is the degenerate case and represents a transition between the elliptic and hyperbolic types.\n\nThe given PDE is\n$$ \\left(\\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{x}{\\epsilon}\\right) + \\delta\\right)\\frac{\\partial^{2}u}{\\partial x^{2}} + \\frac{\\partial^{2}u}{\\partial y^{2}} + \\text{lower-order terms} = 0. $$\nThe coefficients of the principal part are:\n$$ A(x) = \\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{x}{\\epsilon}\\right) + \\delta $$\n$$ B(x) = 0 $$\n$$ C(x) = 1 $$\nThe coefficients are independent of the variable $y$.

We must solve for the locations $x$ that satisfy the parabolic condition:\n$$ \\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{\\epsilon}\\right) + \\delta = 0 \\implies \\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{\\epsilon}\\right) = -\\delta. $$\nWe are given the constraint $0  \\delta  1$, which implies $-1  -\\delta  0$. Since the value $-\\delta$ is within the range of the cosine function, real solutions for $x$ exist.\n\nWe are asked for the smallest positive location $x_{\\ast}$ in the strip $x \\in [0, \\pi\\epsilon]$ where a transition occurs. Let us define a new variable $z = x/\\epsilon$. The domain for $z$ is $[0, \\pi]$. The equation for the transition points becomes:\n$$ \\cos(z) = -\\delta. $$\nThe principal value solution for this equation is given by the arccosine function, $z = \\arccos(-\\delta)$. The range of the arccosine function is $[0, \\pi]$. Given that $-1  -\\delta  0$, the principal value lies in the open interval $(\\pi/2, \\pi)$. Specifically, $z = \\arccos(-\\delta)$ is the only solution to $\\cos(z)=-\\delta$ in the interval $[0, \\pi]$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive value of $z$ that satisfies the condition is $z_{\\ast} = \\arccos(-\\delta)$.\nThis corresponds to the location $x_{\\ast}$ given by:\n$$ x_{\\ast} = \\epsilon z_{\\ast} = \\epsilon \\arccos(-\\delta). $$\nSince $\\pi/2  \\arccos(-\\delta)  \\pi$, we have $\\pi\\epsilon/2  x_{\\ast}  \\pi\\epsilon$. This confirms that $x_{\\ast}$ is within the specified domain $[0, \\pi\\epsilon]$ and is positive.\n\nWe must verify that the transition at $x_{\\ast}$ is from elliptic to hyperbolic.\n- At $x=0$, we have $A(0) = \\cos(0) + \\delta = 1+\\delta$. Since $\\delta  0$, $A(0)  0$. The discriminant is $\\Delta(0) = -A(0) = -(1+\\delta)  0$, so the PDE is elliptic at the beginning of the strip.\n- For $x$ in the interval $[0, x_{\\ast})$, we have $x/\\epsilon  \\arccos(-\\delta)$. Since $z = x/\\epsilon$ is in the interval $[0, \\pi]$, where the cosine function is monotonically decreasing, it follows that $\\cos(x/\\epsilon)  \\cos(\\arccos(-\\delta)) = -\\delta$. This implies $\\cos(x/\\epsilon) + \\delta  0$, so $\\Delta(x)  0$. Thus, the PDE is elliptic for $x \\in [0, x_{\\ast})$.\n- For $x$ in the interval $(x_{\\ast}, \\pi\\epsilon]$, we have $x/\\epsilon  \\arccos(-\\delta)$. Again, due to the decreasing nature of cosine on $[0, \\pi]$, we have $\\cos(x/\\epsilon)  \\cos(\\arccos(-\\delta)) = -\\delta$. This implies $\\cos(x/\\epsilon) + \\delta  0$, so $\\Delta(x)  0$. Thus, the PDE is hyperbolic for $x \\in (x_{\\ast}, \\pi\\epsilon]$.\n\nThe point $x_{\\ast} = \\epsilon \\arccos(-\\delta)$ is therefore the smallest positive location in the domain where the PDE transitions from elliptic to hyperbolic type. The expression is in closed form as requested. An alternative but equivalent form is $x_{\\ast} = \\epsilon (\\pi - \\arccos(\\delta))$.",

This is equivalent to requiring the off-diagonal elements of the matrix $\\tilde{M}$ to be zero, i.e., $\\tilde{M}$ must be a diagonal matrix.

The classification depends on the sign of the discriminant $\\Delta = (2B)^2 - 4AC = 4(B^2-AC)$. The term $B^2-AC$ is the negative of the determinant of $M$, $\\det(M) = AC-B^2$. The determinant is also the product of the eigenvalues, $\\det(M) = \\lambda_1 \\lambda_2$.\nThe classification rules are:\n- Elliptic: $B^2 - AC  0 \\iff AC - B^2  0 \\iff \\det(M)  0$. This implies $\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2  0$, so the eigenvalues have the same sign.\n- Parabolic: $B^2 - AC = 0 \\iff AC - B^2 = 0 \\iff \\det(M) = 0$. This implies $\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 = 0$, so at least one eigenvalue is zero.\n- Hyperbolic: $B^2 - AC  0 \\iff AC - B^2  0 \\iff \\det(M)  0$. This implies $\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2  0$, so the eigenvalues have opposite signs.\nSince the given problem states $A0$ and $C0$, the trace of $M$, $\\text{tr}(M) = A+C = \\lambda_1+\\lambda_2$, is always positive. Thus, for the elliptic case, both eigenvalues must be positive.\n\nNow, we apply this to the specific coefficients given:\n$$ A(\\alpha) = 4 + \\alpha^{2}, \\qquad B(\\alpha) = \\alpha, \\qquad C(\\alpha) = 1 + \\alpha^{2} $$\nWe compute the discriminant term $B^2 - AC$:\n$$ B(\\alpha)^2 - A(\\alpha)C(\\alpha) = \\alpha^2 - (4 + \\alpha^2)(1 + \\alpha^2) $$\n$$ = \\alpha^2 - (4 + 4\\alpha^2 + \\alpha^2 + \\alpha^4) $$\n$$ = \\alpha^2 - (4 + 5\\alpha^2 + \\alpha^4) $$\n$$ = -\\alpha^4 - 4\\alpha^2 - 4 = -(\\alpha^4 + 4\\alpha^2 + 4) $$\n$$ = -(\\alpha^2 + 2)^2 $$\nFor any $\\alpha  0$, the term $\\alpha^2$ is positive. Thus, $\\alpha^2 + 2$ is always a positive real number greater than $2$. Its square, $(\\alpha^2 + 2)^2$, is strictly positive. Therefore, for all $\\alpha  0$, we have:\n$$ B^2 - AC = -(\\alpha^2 + 2)^2  0 $$\nSince the discriminant is always negative, the PDE is **elliptic** for all $\\alpha  0$.\n\nFinally, we derive the explicit closed-form expression for the rotation angle $\\theta(\\alpha)$. We use the formula derived earlier:\n$$ \\tan(2\\theta) = \\frac{2B}{A-C} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $A, B, C$ in terms of $\\alpha$:\n$$ A-C = (4 + \\alpha^2) - (1 + \\alpha^2) = 3 $$\n$$ 2B = 2\\alpha $$\nThus,\n$$ \\tan(2\\theta) = \\frac{2\\alpha}{3} $$\nSolving for $\\theta$ by taking the inverse tangent:\n$$ 2\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{2\\alpha}{3}\\right) $$\n$$ \\theta(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{2}\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2\\alpha}{3}\\right) $$\nThe range of the principal value of the $\\arctan$ function is $(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, so $\\theta$ lies in $(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{\\pi}{4})$. Since $\\alpha  0$, we have $\\frac{2\\alpha}{3}  0$, which means $2\\theta \\in (0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$ and $\\theta \\in (0, \\frac{\\pi}{4})$. This provides a unique angle for the required rotation.\nThe final answer is the explicit expression for $\\theta(\\alpha)$.",

First, we compute the flux values:\n$$\n\\tilde{f}(u_{L}) = \\tilde{f}(2) = \\frac{1}{2}(2)^{2} + \\frac{1}{8}(2)^{4} = \\frac{4}{2} + \\frac{16}{8} = 2 + 2 = 4.\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{f}(u_{R}) = \\tilde{f}(-1) = \\frac{1}{2}(-1)^{2} + \\frac{1}{8}(-1)^{4} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{4}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{5}{8}.\n$$\nThe jumps in $u$ and $\\tilde{f}$ are:\n$$\n\\Delta u = u_{L} - u_{R} = 2 - (-1) = 3.\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\tilde{f} = \\tilde{f}(u_{L}) - \\tilde{f}(u_{R}) = 4 - \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{32}{8} - \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{27}{8}.\n$$\nFinally, the shock speed $s$ is:\n$$\ns = \\frac{\\Delta \\tilde{f}}{\\Delta u} = \\frac{27/8}{3} = \\frac{27}{24} = \\frac{9}{8}.\n$$\nThe entropy condition for the admissibility of this shock is satisfied because the flux function $\\tilde{f}(u)$ is convex, as verified by its second derivative $\\tilde{f}''(u) = 1 + \\frac{3}{2}u^{2}  0$, and $u_{L}  u_{R}$.",
