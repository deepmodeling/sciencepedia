The core principle governing this problem is the principle of dimensional homogeneity, which states that for any physically meaningful equation, the dimensions of all terms must be identical.\n\nLet $[X]$ denote the dimensions of a physical quantity $X$ in terms of the base dimensions of mass ($\\mathsf{M}$), length ($\\mathsf{L}$), and time ($\\mathsf{T}$).

We can write the dimensional equivalent of the equation as:\n$$[E] = [\\rho^{\\alpha} v^{\\beta} L^{\\gamma}]$$\n\nUsing the property that the dimensions of a product of quantities are the product of their individual dimensions raised to the appropriate powers, we have:\n$$[E] = [\\rho]^{\\alpha} [v]^{\\beta} [L]^{\\gamma}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the known base dimensions into this equation:\n$$\\mathsf{M}^{1} \\mathsf{L}^{2} \\mathsf{T}^{-2} = (\\mathsf{M}^{1} \\mathsf{L}^{-3})^{\\alpha} (\\mathsf{L}^{1} \\mathsf{T}^{-1})^{\\beta} (\\mathsf{L}^{1})^{\\gamma}$$\n\nNext, we apply the laws of exponents to the right-hand side of the equation to group the base dimensions $\\mathsf{M}$, $\\mathsf{L}$, and $\\mathsf{T}$:\n$$\\mathsf{M}^{1} \\mathsf{L}^{2} \\mathsf{T}^{-2} = (\\mathsf{M}^{\\alpha}) (\\mathsf{L}^{-3\\alpha}) (\\mathsf{L}^{\\beta} \\mathsf{T}^{-\\beta}) (\\mathsf{L}^{\\gamma})$$\n\nCombining the exponents for each base dimension yields:\n$$\\mathsf{M}^{1} \\mathsf{L}^{2} \\mathsf{T}^{-2} = \\mathsf{M}^{\\alpha} \\mathsf{L}^{-3\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma} \\mathsf{T}^{-\\beta}$$\n\nFor dimensional homogeneity to hold, the net exponent of each base dimension on the left side must equal the net exponent of the corresponding base dimension on the right side. This equivalency establishes a system of three linear equations for the three unknown exponents $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$.\n\nEquating the exponents for mass ($\\mathsf{M}$):\n$$1 = \\alpha$$\n\nEquating the exponents for length ($\\mathsf{L}$):\n$$2 = -3\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma$$\n\nEquating the exponents for time ($\\mathsf{T}$):\n$$-2 = -\\beta$$\n\nWe can now solve this system of equations.\nFrom the mass equation, we find directly:\n$$\\alpha = 1$$\n\nFrom the time equation, we find directly:\n$$\\beta = 2$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the now-known values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ into the length equation to solve for $\\gamma$:\n$$2 = -3(1) + (2) + \\gamma$$\n$$2 = -3 + 2 + \\gamma$$\n$$2 = -1 + \\gamma$$\n$$ \\gamma = 2 + 1 = 3$$\n\nThus, the exponents that ensure the expression for $E$ has the dimensions of energy are $\\alpha=1$, $\\beta=2$, and $\\gamma=3$.

The base dimensions are $\\mathsf{M}$, $\\mathsf{L}$, and $\\mathsf{T}$.

The dimension vector is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe dimension matrix $A$ is formed by arranging these column vectors in the specified order $\\{\\rho, \\mu, \\nu\\}$:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -3 & -1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of $A$, $\\det(A)$, is computed using cofactor expansion along the first row:\n$$\n\\det(A) = 1 \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{vmatrix} - 1 \\begin{vmatrix} -3 & 2 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{vmatrix} + 0 \\begin{vmatrix} -3 & -1 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{vmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\det(A) = 1((-1)(-1) - (2)(-1)) - 1((-3)(-1) - (2)(0)) + 0\n$$\n$$\n\\det(A) = 1(1 + 2) - 1(3 - 0) = 3 - 3 = 0\n$$\nThe determinant of the dimension matrix $A$ is $0$.\n\n**Task 2: Briefly justify why the choice of repeating variables $\\{\\rho, \\mu, \\nu\\}$ is improper.**\n\nA set of repeating variables must be dimensionally independent. This means that it is not possible to form a dimensionless group using only the variables within the set. Mathematically, the dimensional independence of $k$ repeating variables expressed in terms of $k$ base dimensions is confirmed if the $k \\times k$ dimension matrix has a non-zero determinant (i.e., it is non-singular and its column vectors are linearly independent).\n\nAs calculated in the previous step, $\\det(A) = 0$. This indicates that the dimension vectors for $\\rho$, $\\mu$, and $\\nu$ are linearly dependent, and thus the set is dimensionally dependent.\n\nFrom first principles, we can demonstrate this dependence using the provided physical relationship $\\nu = \\mu / \\rho$. Let's form a product of the repeating variables $\\rho^{i}\\mu^{j}\\nu^{k}$ and check if it can be made dimensionless. Using the given relation, we can write $\\nu \\rho \\mu^{-1} = 1$. This is a dimensionless product formed exclusively from the repeating variables. The existence of such a product is the definition of dimensional dependence, which violates a fundamental requirement for the selection of repeating variables in the Buckingham $\\Pi$-theorem.\n\n**Task 3: Attempt to form the dimensionless group for $v_{s}$ using the improper set and state whether a solution exists.**\n\nWe attempt to find exponents $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that the product $\\Pi_{v}^{\\text{(wrong)}} = v_{s}\\,\\rho^{a}\\,\\mu^{b}\\,\\nu^{c}$ is dimensionless.\nWe write the dimensional equation:\n$$\n[\\mathsf{M}^{0}\\mathsf{L}^{0}\\mathsf{T}^{0}] = [v_{s}]\\,[\\rho]^{a}\\,[\\mu]^{b}\\,[\\nu]^{c}\n$$\n$$\n[\\mathsf{M}^{0}\\mathsf{L}^{0}\\mathsf{T}^{0}] = (\\mathsf{L}\\,\\mathsf{T}^{-1})\\,(\\mathsf{M}\\,\\mathsf{L}^{-3})^{a}\\,(\\mathsf{M}\\,\\mathsf{L}^{-1}\\,\\mathsf{T}^{-1})^{b}\\,(\\mathsf{L}^{2}\\,\\mathsf{T}^{-1})^{c}\n$$\nEquating the exponents for each base dimension ($\\mathsf{M}$, $\\mathsf{L}$, and $\\mathsf{T}$) yields a system of linear equations:\n1.  For Mass ($\\mathsf{M}$): $0 = a + b$\n2.  For Length ($\\mathsf{L}$): $0 = 1 - 3a - b + 2c$\n3.  For Time ($\\mathsf{T}$): $0 = -1 - b - c$\n\nWe solve this system. From equation (1), $a = -b$.\nSubstitute $a = -b$ into equation (2):\n$0 = 1 - 3(-b) - b + 2c \\implies 0 = 1 + 3b - b + 2c \\implies 0 = 1 + 2b + 2c$.\nFrom equation (3), $c = -1 - b$.\nSubstitute this expression for $c$ into the modified equation (2):\n$0 = 1 + 2b + 2(-1 - b) \\implies 0 = 1 + 2b - 2 - 2b \\implies 0 = -1$.\nThis is a contradiction. The system of equations is inconsistent and has no solution for the exponents $a$, $b$, and $c$. Therefore, it is impossible to form a dimensionless group for $v_{s}$ using the improper repeating set $\\{\\rho, \\mu, \\nu\\}$. This confirms the consequence of the set's dimensional dependence.\n\n**Task 4: Choose a proper repeating set $\\{\\rho, \\mu, D\\}$, construct the corresponding linear system, and find the correct $\\Pi$ group for $v_{s}$.**\n\nThe new proposed repeating set is $\\{\\rho, \\mu, D\\}$. We first verify its suitability by checking the determinant of its dimension matrix.\n- $[\\rho] = \\mathsf{M}^{1}\\mathsf{L}^{-3}\\mathsf{T}^{0}$\n- $[\\mu] = \\mathsf{M}^{1}\\mathsf{L}^{-1}\\mathsf{T}^{-1}$\n- $[D] = \\mathsf{M}^{0}\\mathsf{L}^{1}\\mathsf{T}^{0}$\nThe dimension matrix $A'$ is:\n$$\nA' = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -3 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant is $\\det(A') = 1((-1)(0) - (1)(-1)) - 1((-3)(0) - (1)(0)) = 1(1) = 1$. Since $\\det(A') \\neq 0$, the set is dimensionally independent and thus is a proper repeating set.\n\nNow, we form the dimensionless group $\\Pi_{v_{s}}$ containing $v_{s}$ with exponents $x$, $y$, and $z$:\n$$\n\\Pi_{v_{s}} = v_{s}\\,\\rho^{x}\\,\\mu^{y}\\,D^{z}\n$$\nThe dimensional equation is:\n$$\n[\\mathsf{M}^{0}\\mathsf{L}^{0}\\mathsf{T}^{0}] = (\\mathsf{L}\\,\\mathsf{T}^{-1})\\,(\\mathsf{M}\\,\\mathsf{L}^{-3})^{x}\\,(\\mathsf{M}\\,\\mathsf{L}^{-1}\\,\\mathsf{T}^{-1})^{y}\\,(\\mathsf{L})^{z}\n$$\nThis yields the following system of linear equations for the exponents:\n1.  For Mass ($\\mathsf{M}$): $0 = x + y$\n2.  For Length ($\\mathsf{L}$): $0 = 1 - 3x - y + z$\n3.  For Time ($\\mathsf{T}$): $0 = -1 - y$\n\nWe solve this system:\n- From equation (3), we immediately find $y = -1$.\n- Substituting $y = -1$ into equation (1): $0 = x + (-1) \\implies x = 1$.\n- Substituting $x = 1$ and $y = -1$ into equation (2): $0 = 1 - 3(1) - (-1) + z \\implies 0 = 1 - 3 + 1 + z \\implies 0 = -1 + z \\implies z = 1$.\n\nThe exponents are $x=1$, $y=-1$, and $z=1$.\nThe resulting correct $\\Pi$ group is:\n$$\n\\Pi_{v_{s}} = v_{s}\\,\\rho^{1}\\,\\mu^{-1}\\,D^{1} = \\frac{\\rho v_{s} D}{\\mu}\n$$\nThis dimensionless group is recognized as the Reynolds number, a fundamental parameter in fluid dynamics.",

            "solution": "The problem is validated as being scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It is a standard problem in the field of fluid mechanics concerning dimensional analysis and dynamic similarity.\n\nWe begin by identifying the dimensionless groups that govern the flow dynamics. The flow of an incompressible Newtonian fluid with a free surface is described by the continuity and momentum (Navier-Stokes) equations. Let $\\mathbf{u}$ be the velocity field, $p$ be the pressure, $\\rho$ be the fluid density (constant), $\\nu$ be the kinematic viscosity, and $g$ be the gravitational acceleration. The equations are:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\nabla p + \\mathbf{g} + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational acceleration vector.\n\nTo nondimensionalize these equations, we introduce characteristic scales for the prototype flow: a velocity scale $U_p$, a horizontal length scale $L_p$, and a vertical depth scale $H_p$. We define dimensionless variables (indicated by an asterisk) as follows:\n$$ \\mathbf{x}^* = \\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{L_p}, \\quad t^* = \\frac{t}{L_p/U_p}, \\quad \\mathbf{u}^* = \\frac{\\mathbf{u}}{U_p}, \\quad p^* = \\frac{p - p_{atm}}{\\rho_p U_p^2} $$\nwhere we express the pressure relative to atmospheric pressure $p_{atm}$ and scale it by the dynamic pressure. The gravitational vector is $\\mathbf{g}_p = -g_p \\mathbf{k}$, where $\\mathbf{k}$ is the upward vertical unit vector.\n\nSubstituting these into the momentum equation and multiplying by $L_p/U_p^2$, we obtain the dimensionless momentum equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}^*}{\\partial t^*} + (\\mathbf{u}^* \\cdot \\nabla^*) \\mathbf{u}^* = -\\nabla^* p^* - \\frac{g_p L_p}{U_p^2} \\mathbf{k} + \\frac{\\nu_p}{U_p L_p} \\nabla^{*2} \\mathbf{u}^* $$\nIn the context of free-surface flows, it is more conventional to scale the vertical coordinate $z$ by $H_p$. However, since the problem states $H_p$ is of the same order as $L_p$ and the scaling factor $\\lambda_L$ applies to both, using a single length scale $L_p$ for nondimensionalization is consistent. This process reveals two fundamental dimensionless groups that must be preserved for dynamic similarity between the prototype ($p$) and the model ($m$):\n\n1.  The Reynolds number, $\\mathrm{Re}$, which is the ratio of inertial to viscous forces:\n    $$ \\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{U L}{\\nu} $$\n2.  The Froude number, $\\mathrm{Fr}$, which is the ratio of inertial to gravitational forces. For open-channel flows, the characteristic length scale is the depth, $H$:\n    $$ \\mathrm{Fr} = \\frac{U}{\\sqrt{g H}} $$\n\nDynamic similarity requires that these dimensionless numbers are identical for the model and the prototype:\n$$ \\mathrm{Re}_m = \\mathrm{Re}_p \\implies \\frac{U_m L_m}{\\nu_m} = \\frac{U_p L_p}{\\nu_p} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Fr}_m = \\mathrm{Fr}_p \\implies \\frac{U_m}{\\sqrt{g_m H_m}} = \\frac{U_p}{\\sqrt{g_p H_p}} $$\n\nWe are given the scaling ratios: $\\lambda_L = L_m/L_p = H_m/H_p$, $\\lambda_g = g_m/g_p$, $\\lambda_U = U_m/U_p$, and $\\lambda_\\nu = \\nu_m/\\nu_p$. We can now derive the scaling relations.\n\nFrom the equality of Froude numbers:\n$$ \\frac{U_m}{U_p} = \\frac{\\sqrt{g_m H_m}}{\\sqrt{g_p H_p}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{g_m}{g_p}} \\sqrt{\\frac{H_m}{H_p}} $$\nIn terms of the scaling ratios, this is:\n$$ \\lambda_U = \\sqrt{\\lambda_g \\lambda_L} $$\n\nFrom the equality of Reynolds numbers:\n$$ \\frac{\\nu_m}{\\nu_p} = \\left(\\frac{U_m}{U_p}\\right) \\left(\\frac{L_m}{L_p}\\right) $$\nIn terms of the scaling ratios, this gives:\n$$ \\lambda_\\nu = \\lambda_U \\lambda_L $$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\lambda_U$ from the Froude condition into the Reynolds condition:\n$$ \\lambda_\\nu = (\\sqrt{\\lambda_g \\lambda_L}) \\lambda_L = \\lambda_g^{1/2} \\lambda_L^{3/2} $$\nThese are the required scaling relations for velocity and viscosity that ensure simultaneous Froude and Reynolds similarity.\n\nNext, we discuss the constraints that arise for typical laboratory models where $\\lambda_g = 1$ (i.e., $g_m = g_p$, using Earth's gravity for both model and prototype) and $\\lambda_L \\ll 1$ (a small-scale model).\nSubstituting $\\lambda_g = 1$ into our derived scaling relations gives:\n$$ \\lambda_U = \\sqrt{\\lambda_L} $$\n$$ \\lambda_\\nu = \\lambda_L^{3/2} $$\nThe second relation, $\\lambda_\\nu = \\nu_m/\\nu_p = \\lambda_L^{3/2}$, imposes a severe constraint. Since $\\lambda_L \\ll 1$, it follows that $\\lambda_L^{3/2}$ is a very small number. For example, if a river reach is modeled at a scale of $\\lambda_L = 1/100 = 0.01$, the required kinematic viscosity of the model fluid would be $\\nu_m = \\nu_p \\times (0.01)^{3/2} = \\nu_p \\times 0.001$. If the prototype fluid is water (with $\\nu_p \\approx 1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$), the model would require a fluid with $\\nu_m \\approx 1.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$. No common, safe laboratory fluid has such a low kinematic viscosity. Therefore, it is practically impossible to satisfy both Reynolds and Froude similarity in a small-scale model under normal gravitational conditions.\n\nA physically plausible strategy to relax this constraint is to abandon strict Reynolds number similarity. In many geophysical flows, such as large rivers, the prototype Reynolds number is extremely large ($\\mathrm{Re}_p \\gg 10^6$), indicating a fully turbulent flow regime where inertial forces dominate over viscous forces. In such flows, many bulk flow properties (like the friction factor in rough channels or the overall patterns of secondary circulation) become independent of the Reynolds number, provided it remains sufficiently large to ensure a fully turbulent state. This is known as the principle of *Reynolds number independence*.\n\nThe strategy is thus to operate the model under the condition of Froude similarity ($\\mathrm{Fr}_m = \\mathrm{Fr}_p$) while ensuring that the model Reynolds number, $\\mathrm{Re}_m$, is large enough to achieve a turbulent flow state that is qualitatively similar to the prototype's. This may not equal $\\mathrm{Re}_p$, but it places the model in the correct, Reynolds-independent dynamical regime. This makes Froude number scaling the primary criterion for achieving dynamic similarity of the dominant gravitational and inertial effects. This approach is standard practice in hydraulic engineering.\n\nFinally, we report the general expression for the required model kinematic viscosity $\\nu_m$ that ensures simultaneous Reynolds and Froude similarity. From our derived scaling law for viscosity:\n$$ \\lambda_\\nu = \\frac{\\nu_m}{\\nu_p} = \\lambda_g^{1/2} \\lambda_L^{3/2} $$\nSolving for $\\nu_m$, we get:\n$$ \\nu_m = \\nu_p \\lambda_g^{1/2} \\lambda_L^{3/2} $$\nThis expression gives the kinematic viscosity the model fluid must have to satisfy both similarity criteria simultaneously for given scaling factors of length ($\\lambda_L$) and gravity ($\\lambda_g$) and a known prototype viscosity ($\\nu_p$).",
