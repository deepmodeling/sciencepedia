The Navier slip boundary condition is a physically and mathematically well-established model used in fluid mechanics, especially relevant in micro- and nano-scale flows. The problem is fundamentally sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a second-order ordinary differential equation governing the velocity profile and two boundary conditions (one for each wall). This setup is sufficient to determine a unique solution for $u(y)$. The problem is mathematically well-posed.\n- **Objective:** The language is clear, precise, and objective, using standard terminology from physics and mathematics. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n- **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup:** The problem is self-contained. All necessary information is provided, albeit symbolically. The boundary conditions are symmetric, which is consistent with the symmetric geometry.\n- **Unrealistic or Infeasible:** The problem is an idealized model but is physically and scientifically plausible.\n- **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured:** The problem is clearly structured and leads to a unique, stable solution.\n- The problem is a standard textbook exercise that tests fundamental principles and is neither trivial nor pseudo-profound.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe governing equation for the fluid motion is the steady-state, incompressible Navier-Stokes momentum equation, which simplifies under the given conditions. With steady flow ($\\partial/\\partial t = 0$), no body forces, and a velocity field of the form $\\mathbf{v} = (u(y), 0, 0)$, the momentum equation becomes:\n$$0 = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}$$\nThe continuity equation $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0$ reduces to $\\partial u/\\partial x = 0$, confirming that $u$ is a function of $y$ only. Analyzing the components of the momentum equation:\n- y-component: $0 = -\\partial p/\\partial y \\implies p$ is not a function of $y$.\n- z-component: $0 = -\\partial p/\\partial z \\implies p$ is not a function of $z$.\nTherefore, pressure $p$ is a function of $x$ only, so $p=p(x)$. The x-component of the momentum equation is:\n$$0 = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x} + \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 u}{\\mathrm{d} y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2} \\right)$$\nSince $u=u(y)$, this simplifies to a second-order ordinary differential equation for $u(y)$:\n$$\\mu \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 u}{\\mathrm{d} y^2} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}$$\nThe pressure gradient $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}$ is given as a constant, which we will denote by $G$.\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 u}{\\mathrm{d} y^2} = \\frac{G}{\\mu}$$\nIntegrating twice with respect to $y$ gives the general solution for the velocity profile:\n$$u(y) = \\frac{G}{2\\mu} y^2 + C_1 y + C_2$$\nDue to the symmetry of the geometry and the flow about the mid-plane $y=0$, the velocity profile $u(y)$ must be an even function of $y$, which implies that the coefficient of the odd term $y$ must be zero. Hence, $C_1=0$.\nThe velocity profile is thus parabolic:\n$$u(y) = \\frac{G}{2\\mu} y^2 + C_2$$\n\nFirst, we solve for the no-slip case to establish a baseline. The no-slip boundary condition is $u=0$ at the walls $y=\\pm h/2$. Applying this at $y=h/2$:\n$$0 = \\frac{G}{2\\mu} \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2 + C_2 \\implies C_2 = -\\frac{G h^2}{8\\mu}$$\nThe velocity profile for the no-slip case is:\n$$u_{\\text{no-slip}}(y) = \\frac{G}{2\\mu} \\left( y^2 - \\frac{h^2}{4} \\right)$$\nThe volumetric flow rate per unit width, $Q_{\\text{no-slip}}$, is obtained by integrating $u_{\\text{no-slip}}(y)$ from $y=-h/2$ to $y=h/2$:\n$$Q_{\\text{no-slip}} = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\frac{G}{2\\mu} \\left( y^2 - \\frac{h^2}{4} \\right) \\mathrm{d}y = \\frac{G}{\\mu} \\int_{0}^{h/2} \\left( y^2 - \\frac{h^2}{4} \\right) \\mathrm{d}y$$\n$$Q_{\\text{no-slip}} = \\frac{G}{\\mu} \\left[ \\frac{y^3}{3} - \\frac{h^2}{4}y \\right]_{0}^{h/2} = \\frac{G}{\\mu} \\left( \\frac{h^3}{24} - \\frac{h^3}{8} \\right) = -\\frac{G h^3}{12\\mu}$$\n\nNext, we solve for the slip case. The general form of the velocity profile is $u_{\\text{slip}}(y) = \\frac{G}{2\\mu} y^2 + C_2$. The slip boundary condition at $y=+h/2$ is $u = b(-\\partial u/\\partial y)$. The derivative is $\\mathrm{d}u/\\mathrm{d}y = Gy/\\mu$.\nAt $y=h/2$:\n$$u(h/2) = \\frac{G}{2\\mu}\\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2 + C_2 = \\frac{Gh^2}{8\\mu} + C_2$$\n$$-\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\bigg|_{y=h/2} = -\\frac{G}{\\mu}\\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{Gh}{2\\mu}$$\nSubstituting into the boundary condition:\n$$\\frac{Gh^2}{8\\mu} + C_2 = b \\left(-\\frac{Gh}{2\\mu}\\right)$$\nSolving for the integration constant $C_2$:\n$$C_2 = -\\frac{Gbh}{2\\mu} - \\frac{Gh^2}{8\\mu} = -\\frac{G}{2\\mu} \\left(bh + \\frac{h^2}{4}\\right)$$\nThe velocity profile for the slip case is:\n$$u_{\\text{slip}}(y) = \\frac{G}{2\\mu} y^2 - \\frac{G}{2\\mu} \\left(bh + \\frac{h^2}{4}\\right) = \\frac{G}{2\\mu} \\left( y^2 - \\frac{h^2}{4} - bh \\right)$$\nWe compute the flow rate $Q_{\\text{slip}}$ by integrating this profile:\n$$Q_{\\text{slip}} = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\frac{G}{2\\mu} \\left( y^2 - \\frac{h^2}{4} - bh \\right) \\mathrm{d}y$$\nWe can separate the integral into two parts:\n$$Q_{\\text{slip}} = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\frac{G}{2\\mu} \\left( y^2 - \\frac{h^2}{4} \\right) \\mathrm{d}y - \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\frac{Gbh}{2\\mu} \\mathrm{d}y$$\nThe first term is identical to $Q_{\\text{no-slip}}$. The second term is the integral of a constant over the interval $[-h/2, h/2]$ of width $h$:\n$$Q_{\\text{slip}} = Q_{\\text{no-slip}} - \\frac{Gbh}{2\\mu} \\cdot h = Q_{\\text{no-slip}} - \\frac{Gbh^2}{2\\mu}$$\n\nFinally, we find the required ratio $Q_{\\text{slip}}/Q_{\\text{no-slip}}$:\n$$\\frac{Q_{\\text{slip}}}{Q_{\\text{no-slip}}} = \\frac{Q_{\\text{no-slip}} - \\frac{Gbh^2}{2\\mu}}{Q_{\\text{no-slip}}} = 1 - \\frac{Gbh^2}{2\\mu Q_{\\text{no-slip}}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $Q_{\\text{no-slip}} = -Gh^3/(12\\mu)$:\n$$\\frac{Q_{\\text{slip}}}{Q_{\\text{no-slip}}} = 1 - \\frac{Gbh^2 / (2\\mu)}{-Gh^3 / (12\\mu)} = 1 + \\frac{bh^2}{2\\mu} \\cdot \\frac{12\\mu}{h^3}$$\nCanceling common terms:\n$$\\frac{Q_{\\text{slip}}}{Q_{\\text{no-slip}}} = 1 + \\frac{12b}{2h} = 1 + \\frac{6b}{h}$$\nThe ratio is a dimensionless quantity that expresses the enhancement of the flow rate due to slip, dependent only on the slip length $b$ relative to the gap thickness $h$.",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe primary task is to find the effective slip velocity, $u_{\\text{slip}} \\equiv u_s(0) - u_D$. We begin by solving for the free-flow velocity profile, $u_s(y)$.\n\n1.  **Solve the Governing Equation for Free-Flow Velocity**\n    The governing equation for the free-flow velocity profile $u_s(y)$ in the domain $y \\in [0, H]$ is given as:\n    $$ \\mu \\frac{d^2 u_s}{dy^2} = G $$\n    We integrate this equation twice with respect to $y$. The first integration yields:\n    $$ \\mu \\frac{d u_s}{dy} = G y + C_1 $$\n    where $C_1$ is the first constant of integration. Dividing by $\\mu$ gives the velocity gradient (shear rate):\n    $$ \\frac{d u_s}{dy} = \\frac{G}{\\mu} y + \\frac{C_1}{\\mu} $$\n    A second integration gives the general solution for the velocity profile:\n    $$ u_s(y) = \\frac{G}{2\\mu} y^2 + \\frac{C_1}{\\mu} y + C_2' $$\n    For notational convenience, let's redefine the constants as $A = C_1/\\mu$ and $B = C_2'$. The general solution is:\n    $$ u_s(y) = \\frac{G}{2\\mu} y^2 + A y + B $$\n    The velocity gradient is $\\frac{du_s}{dy} = \\frac{G}{\\mu} y + A$.\n\n2.  **Apply Boundary Conditions to Determine Integration Constants**\n    We have two unknown constants, $A$ and $B$, which will be determined by the two boundary conditions.\n\n    a.  **No-slip condition at the top wall ($y=H$):**\n        The velocity must be zero at the solid wall: $u_s(H) = 0$.\n        $$ \\frac{G}{2\\mu} H^2 + A H + B = 0 $$\n        This provides our first equation relating $A$ and $B$:\n        $$ B = - \\frac{G H^2}{2\\mu} - A H \\quad \\quad (1) $$\n\n    b.  **Beavers–Joseph interface condition at $y=0$:**\n        The condition is $u_s(0) - u_D = \\alpha \\sqrt{k} \\frac{\\partial u_s}{\\partial y}\\big|_{y=0}$.\n        We evaluate each term:\n        -   $u_s(0) = B$\n        -   $u_D = -\\frac{k G}{\\mu}$ (given)\n        -   $\\frac{\\partial u_s}{\\partial y}\\big|_{y=0} = \\frac{G}{\\mu}(0) + A = A$\n        Substituting these into the BJ condition:\n        $$ B - \\left(-\\frac{k G}{\\mu}\\right) = \\alpha \\sqrt{k} A $$\n        This gives our second equation:\n        $$ B = \\alpha \\sqrt{k} A - \\frac{k G}{\\mu} \\quad \\quad (2) $$\n\n3.  **Solve for the Constants and Derive the Slip Velocity**\n    We now have a system of two linear equations for $A$ and $B$. To find the slip velocity, we first note its definition in the context of the BJ condition.\n    The effective slip velocity is defined as $u_{\\text{slip}} \\equiv u_s(0) - u_D$.\n    From the BJ condition itself, we have a direct relationship:\n    $$ u_{\\text{slip}} = u_s(0) - u_D = \\alpha \\sqrt{k} \\frac{\\partial u_s}{\\partial y}\\big|_{y=0} $$\n    Since we found $\\frac{\\partial u_s}{\\partial y}\\big|_{y=0} = A$, the slip velocity is simply:\n    $$ u_{\\text{slip}} = \\alpha \\sqrt{k} A $$\n    Now, we only need to solve for the constant $A$. We equate the two expressions for $B$ from equations $(1)$ and $(2)$:\n    $$ - \\frac{G H^2}{2\\mu} - A H = \\alpha \\sqrt{k} A - \\frac{k G}{\\mu} $$\n    Rearranging to solve for $A$:\n    $$ \\frac{k G}{\\mu} - \\frac{G H^2}{2\\mu} = A H + \\alpha \\sqrt{k} A $$\n    $$ \\frac{G}{\\mu} \\left(k - \\frac{H^2}{2}\\right) = A (H + \\alpha \\sqrt{k}) $$\n    $$ A = \\frac{G}{\\mu} \\frac{k - \\frac{1}{2}H^2}{H + \\alpha \\sqrt{k}} $$\n    Finally, substitute this expression for $A$ back into the equation for $u_{\\text{slip}}$:\n    $$ u_{\\text{slip}} = \\alpha \\sqrt{k} \\left( \\frac{G}{\\mu} \\frac{k - \\frac{1}{2}H^2}{H + \\alpha \\sqrt{k}} \\right) $$\n    This can be written as:\n    $$ u_{\\text{slip}} = \\frac{G}{\\mu} \\frac{\\alpha \\sqrt{k} \\left(k - \\frac{1}{2}H^2\\right)}{H + \\alpha \\sqrt{k}} $$\n    This is the final expression for the effective slip velocity. It depends on all the specified model parameters. This expression will be implemented in the program.",
