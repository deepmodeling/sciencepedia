            "solution": "The user wants to find the exponential mixing rate $\\lambda$ for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The solution proceeds in two parts as outlined in the problem statement. First, we determine the invariant measure, and second, we analyze the spectrum of the process generator.\n\n### (a) Derivation of the Stationary Density\n\nThe time evolution of the probability density function $\\rho(x,t)$ for a general one-dimensional diffusion process is given by the forward Kolmogorov (Fokker-Planck) equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t}(x,t) = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\big(b(x)\\,\\rho(x,t)\\big)+\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x^{2}}\\big(a(x)^{2}\\,\\rho(x,t)\\big)\n$$\nFor the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process $dX_{t}=-\\gamma X_{t}\\,dt+\\sigma\\,dW_{t}$, the drift is $b(x)=-\\gamma x$ and the diffusion amplitude is $a(x)=\\sigma$. Substituting these into the Fokker-Planck equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-\\gamma x \\rho) + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x^{2}}(\\sigma^{2} \\rho) = \\gamma \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x \\rho) + \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2}\\frac{\\partial^{2} \\rho}{\\partial x^{2}}\n$$\nThe stationary density, denoted $\\rho_{\\infty}(x)$, is time-independent, so $\\frac{\\partial \\rho_{\\infty}}{\\partial t} = 0$. This implies that the probability current, $J(x)$, must be constant. The current is given by:\n$$\nJ(x) = b(x)\\rho_{\\infty}(x) - \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\big(a(x)^{2}\\,\\rho_{\\infty}(x)\\big) = -\\gamma x \\rho_{\\infty}(x) - \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2}\\frac{d \\rho_{\\infty}}{dx}\n$$\nFor a probability density that is normalizable on $\\mathbb{R}$, we must have $\\rho_{\\infty}(x) \\to 0$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$. This implies the current $J(x)$ must be zero for all $x$. Therefore, we must solve the ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n-\\gamma x \\rho_{\\infty}(x) - \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2}\\frac{d \\rho_{\\infty}}{dx} = 0\n$$\nRearranging the terms gives a separable equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\rho_{\\infty}} \\frac{d \\rho_{\\infty}}{dx} = -\\frac{2\\gamma}{\\sigma^{2}} x\n$$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{d \\rho_{\\infty}}{\\rho_{\\infty}} = \\int -\\frac{2\\gamma}{\\sigma^{2}} x \\, dx\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(\\rho_{\\infty}) = -\\frac{\\gamma}{\\sigma^{2}}x^{2} + C'\n$$\nwhere $C'$ is an integration constant. Exponentiating both sides gives the form of the stationary density:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\infty}(x) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\sigma^{2}}x^{2} + C'\\right) = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma x^{2}}{\\sigma^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $C = \\exp(C')$ is the normalization constant. This functional form is that of a Gaussian distribution. The general form for a Gaussian density with mean $\\mu_{G}$ and variance $\\sigma_{G}^{2}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{N}(x | \\mu_{G}, \\sigma_{G}^{2}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma_{G}^{2}}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-\\mu_{G})^{2}}{2\\sigma_{G}^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nBy comparing our expression for $\\rho_{\\infty}(x)$ with the general form, we can identify that the mean is $\\mu_{G}=0$. The term in the exponent must also match:\n$$\n\\frac{(x-0)^{2}}{2\\sigma_{G}^{2}} = \\frac{\\gamma x^{2}}{\\sigma^{2}} \\implies \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_{G}^{2}} = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\sigma^{2}}\n$$\nSolving for the variance $\\sigma_{G}^{2}$ gives:\n$$\n\\sigma_{G}^{2} = \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2\\gamma}\n$$\nThe normalization constant $C$ is determined by the condition $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\rho_{\\infty}(x) dx = 1$:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma x^{2}}{\\sigma^{2}}\\right) dx = 1\n$$\nUsing the standard Gaussian integral formula $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-ax^{2}}dx = \\sqrt{\\pi/a}$ with $a = \\gamma/\\sigma^{2}$:\n$$\nC \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{\\gamma/\\sigma^{2}}} = C \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi\\sigma^{2}}{\\gamma}} = 1 \\implies C = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\pi\\sigma^{2}}}\n$$\nThis constant is consistent with the general Gaussian form, $1/\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma_{G}^{2}} = 1/\\sqrt{2\\pi(\\sigma^{2}/2\\gamma)} = \\sqrt{\\gamma/(\\pi\\sigma^{2})}$. Thus, the stationary density is a zero-mean Gaussian with variance $\\sigma^{2}/(2\\gamma)$.\n\n### (b) Determination of the Exponential Mixing Rate\n\nThe exponential mixing rate $\\lambda$ is related to the spectrum of the generator $\\mathcal{L}$ of the Markov semigroup $(P_t)_{t \\ge 0}$. The generator is given as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}f(x) = -\\gamma x f'(x) + \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2}f''(x)\n$$\nWe analyze $\\mathcal{L}$ as an operator on the Hilbert space $L^{2}(\\mu)$, where $d\\mu = \\rho_{\\infty}(x)dx$. For a reversible process like the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, $\\mathcal{L}$ is self-adjoint on $L^{2}(\\mu)$ and its spectrum is real and non-positive.\n\nTo find the spectrum of $\\mathcal{L}$, we perform a change of variables to standardize the invariant measure. Let's define a new variable $y$ that follows a standard normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. The variance of $X_{t}$ under the invariant measure is $\\sigma_{G}^{2} = \\sigma^{2}/(2\\gamma)$. We define the rescaled variable as:\n$$\ny = \\frac{x}{\\sigma_{G}} = x\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\gamma}{\\sigma^{2}}} \\quad \\implies \\quad x = y\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2\\gamma}}\n$$\nLet a function $f$ on the $x$-domain be represented by a function $g$ on the $y$-domain, such that $f(x) = g(y(x))$. We express the derivatives of $f$ in terms of derivatives of $g$ using the chain rule:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{dg}{dy}\\frac{dy}{dx} = g'(y)\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\gamma}{\\sigma^{2}}}\n$$\n$$\nf''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(g'(y)\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\gamma}{\\sigma^{2}}}\\right) = g''(y)\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^{2} = g''(y)\\frac{2\\gamma}{\\sigma^{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\mathcal{L}f(x)$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}f(x) = -\\gamma\\left(y\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2\\gamma}}\\right)\\left(g'(y)\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\gamma}{\\sigma^{2}}}\\right) + \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2}\\left(g''(y)\\frac{2\\gamma}{\\sigma^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}f(x) = -\\gamma y g'(y) + \\gamma g''(y) = \\gamma(g''(y) - y g'(y))\n$$\nThis gives the form of the generator $\\tilde{\\mathcal{L}}$ in the rescaled coordinate system: $\\tilde{\\mathcal{L}}g(y) = \\gamma(g''(y) - y g'(y))$. The operator $\\tilde{\\mathcal{L}}$ is unitarily equivalent to $\\mathcal{L}$, and thus shares the same spectrum.\n\nThe operator $L_{H} = \\frac{d^{2}}{dy^{2}} - y\\frac{d}{dy}$ is a well-known operator whose eigenfunctions are the (probabilists') Hermite polynomials, $He_{n}(y)$. These polynomials form a complete orthogonal basis for the space $L^{2}(\\mathbb{R}, e^{-y^{2}/2}dy)$. They satisfy the differential equation:\n$$\nHe_{n}''(y) - y He_{n}'(y) + n He_{n}(y) = 0\n$$\nFrom this, we see that $He_{n}(y)$ is an eigenfunction of $L_{H}$:\n$$\nL_{H}He_{n}(y) = He_{n}''(y) - y He_{n}'(y) = -n He_{n}(y)\n$$\nTherefore, the Hermite polynomials are also eigenfunctions of our rescaled generator $\\tilde{\\mathcal{L}}$:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mathcal{L}}He_{n}(y) = \\gamma (L_{H}He_{n}(y)) = -n\\gamma He_{n}(y)\n$$\nThe spectrum of $\\mathcal{L}$ (and $\\tilde{\\mathcal{L}}$) is discrete and consists of the eigenvalues $\\nu_{n} = -n\\gamma$ for $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n\nThe semigroup $P_{t} = \\exp(t\\mathcal{L})$ acts on an eigenfunction $f_{n}$ (corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\nu_{n}$) as $P_{t}f_{n} = \\exp(\\nu_{n}t)f_{n}$. Any function $f \\in L^{2}(\\mu)$ can be expanded in the basis of eigenfunctions. The condition that $f$ is centered, $\\int f d\\mu = 0$, means that $f$ is orthogonal to the eigenfunction for $n=0$, which is $f_{0}(x) = He_{0}(\\dots) = 1$. Therefore, the expansion of a centered function $f$ begins with the $n=1$ term.\n$$\nf = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} c_{n} f_{n} \\quad \\text{where } f_n(x) = He_n(x\\sqrt{2\\gamma/\\sigma^2})\n$$\nThe action of the semigroup on $f$ is:\n$$\nP_{t}f = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} c_{n} P_{t} f_{n} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} c_{n} \\exp(-n\\gamma t) f_{n}\n$$\nThe squared norm of $P_{t}f$ in $L^{2}(\\mu)$ is:\n$$\n\\|P_{t}f\\|_{L^{2}(\\mu)}^{2} = \\left\\| \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} c_{n} \\exp(-n\\gamma t) f_{n} \\right\\|_{L^{2}(\\mu)}^{2} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} |c_{n}|^{2} \\exp(-2n\\gamma t) \\|f_{n}\\|_{L^{2}(\\mu)}^{2}\n$$\nSince $\\|f\\|_{L^{2}(\\mu)}^{2} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} |c_{n}|^{2} \\|f_{n}\\|_{L^{2}(\\mu)}^{2}$, we can write:\n$$\n\\|P_{t}f\\|_{L^{2}(\\mu)}^{2} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} |c_{n}|^{2} \\exp(-2n\\gamma t) \\|f_{n}\\|_{L^{2}(\\mu)}^{2} \\le \\exp(-2\\gamma t) \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} |c_{n}|^{2} \\|f_{n}\\|_{L^{2}(\\mu)}^{2}\n$$\nThe inequality holds because for $n \\ge 1$, $\\exp(-2n\\gamma t) \\le \\exp(-2\\gamma t)$, since $\\gamma>0$ and $t\\ge 0$. This gives:\n$$\n\\|P_{t}f\\|_{L^{2}(\\mu)}^{2} \\le \\exp(-2\\gamma t) \\|f\\|_{L^{2}(\\mu)}^{2}\n$$\nTaking the square root yields $\\|P_{t}f\\|_{L^{2}(\\mu)} \\le \\exp(-\\gamma t) \\|f\\|_{L^{2}(\\mu)}$.\nThis inequality holds for any centered function $f$. The constant in the exponent, $\\gamma$, is the \"worst-case\" or slowest decay rate, which corresponds to the first non-zero eigenvalue of $-\\mathcal{L}$. This is called the spectral gap. The spectrum of $-\\mathcal{L}$ is $\\{0, \\gamma, 2\\gamma, \\dots\\}$. The gap between the zero eigenvalue (for constants) and the first positive eigenvalue (for centered functions) is $\\gamma - 0 = \\gamma$.\nThus, the exponential mixing rate $\\lambda$ is exactly this spectral gap.\n$$\n\\lambda = \\gamma\n$$\nThis rate is independent of the noise amplitude $\\sigma$, which only affects the variance of the invariant measure and the spatial scaling of the eigenfunctions.",

            "solution": "The problem statement describes a slow-fast system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). We first validate the problem statement, which is found to be mathematically and scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. We can therefore proceed with a full analysis.\n\nThe system is given by:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dot{x}^\\varepsilon(t) = y^\\varepsilon(t), \\\\\n\\dot{y}^\\varepsilon(t) = \\dfrac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\, y^\\varepsilon(t)\\big(1 - \\big(y^\\varepsilon(t)\\big)^2\\big),\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwith initial conditions $x^\\varepsilon(0) = x_0$ and $y^\\varepsilon(0) = y_0 \\neq 0$. The parameter $\\varepsilon$ is a small positive number, $\\varepsilon > 0$.\n\n**Analysis of the Fast Subsystem**\n\nThe dynamics of the fast variable $y^\\varepsilon$ are governed by the equation $\\dot{y}^\\varepsilon(t) = \\dfrac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\, f(y^\\varepsilon(t))$, where $f(y) = y(1-y^2)$. To analyze its behavior, we consider the equation on the fast time scale $\\tau = t/\\varepsilon$, which gives $\\dfrac{dy}{d\\tau} = y(1-y^2)$.\n\nThe equilibria of the fast dynamics are the roots of $f(y) = 0$, which are $y \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\nTo determine their stability, we examine the sign of the derivative $f'(y) = 1 - 3y^2$ at these points:\n-   At $y=0$, $f'(0) = 1 > 0$, so $y=0$ is an unstable equilibrium.\n-   At $y=1$, $f'(1) = 1 - 3 = -2 < 0$, so $y=1$ is a stable equilibrium (an attractor).\n-   At $y=-1$, $f'(-1) = 1 - 3 = -2 < 0$, so $y=-1$ is also a stable equilibrium (an attractor).\n\nFor any initial condition $y_0 \\neq 0$, the solution $y^\\varepsilon(t)$ rapidly converges to one of the stable equilibria. Specifically, if $y_0 > 0$, then $y^\\varepsilon(t) \\to 1$. If $y_0 < 0$, then $y^\\varepsilon(t) \\to -1$. In summary, for $y_0 \\neq 0$, $y^\\varepsilon(t) \\to \\operatorname{sgn}(y_0)$ as $t/\\varepsilon \\to \\infty$.\n\n**Invariant Measures and Ergodicity**\n\nAn invariant probability measure $\\mu$ must be supported on sets that are invariant under the fast flow. The fixed points $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ are the simplest such sets. A Dirac measure centered at any fixed point is an invariant measure. Thus, $\\delta_{-1}$, $\\delta_0$, and $\\delta_1$ are all invariant probability measures.\nThe set of all invariant probability measures is the convex hull of these measures:\n$$\n\\mathcal{M}_{inv} = \\left\\{ c_{-1} \\delta_{-1} + c_0 \\delta_0 + c_1 \\delta_1 \\mid c_i \\ge 0, \\sum c_i = 1 \\right\\}.\n$$\nThis set is infinite, not a single unique measure.\n\nErgodicity with respect to a measure $\\mu$ means that any invariant set under the flow has $\\mu$-measure $0$ or $1$. The state space $\\mathbb{R}$ for the fast flow is partitioned into basins of attraction for the equilibria: $(-\\infty, 0)$, $\\{0\\}$, and $(0, \\infty)$. These are all invariant sets.\nIf we take a measure such as $\\mu = \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_{-1} + \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_1$, the invariant set $A = \\{-1\\}$ has $\\mu(A) = 1/2$, which is neither $0$ nor $1$. Therefore, the flow is not ergodic with respect to $\\mu$. The flow is only ergodic with respect to the pure Dirac measures $\\delta_{-1}$, $\\delta_0$, and $\\delta_1$. Crucially, there is no single ergodic measure that governs the dynamics for all initial conditions; the relevant measure is selected by the initial condition $y_0$. This is a classic example of a system where the simple version of the averaging principle does not apply due to the lack of ergodicity on the whole space.\n\n**Averaged Dynamics**\n\nFor a given $y_0 \\neq 0$, the fast variable $y^\\varepsilon(t)$ quickly settles to $y_{eq} = \\operatorname{sgn}(y_0)$. The averaging principle, in a form applicable to systems with multiple attracting measures, states that the slow variable $x^\\varepsilon$ converges to the solution $\\overline{x}$ of the averaged equation $\\dot{\\overline{x}} = \\overline{h}$, where $\\overline{h}$ is the average of the fast vector field with respect to the invariant measure selected by the initial condition $y_0$. Here, the selected measure is $\\mu_{y_0} = \\delta_{\\operatorname{sgn}(y_0)}$.\nThe averaged vector field is $\\overline{h} = \\int h(y) \\,d\\mu_{y_0}(y) = h(\\operatorname{sgn}(y_0))$. Since $h(y)=y$, we have $\\overline{h} = \\operatorname{sgn}(y_0)$.\nThe limiting slow dynamics are therefore $\\dot{\\overline{x}}(t) = \\operatorname{sgn}(y_0)$. With the initial condition $\\overline{x}(0) = x_0$, the solution is $\\overline{x}(t) = x_0 + t\\,\\operatorname{sgn}(y_0)$.\nAs $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, we expect $x^\\varepsilon(t) \\to \\overline{x}(t)$.\n\nWe now evaluate each option.\n\n**A. The fast subsystem is ergodic with respect to an invariant probability measure supported on $\\{-1,0,1\\}$; moreover, for every $y_0\\neq 0$ and fixed $\\varepsilon>0$, the long-time average $\\displaystyle \\lim_{T\\to\\infty}\\mathcal{A}_T^\\varepsilon(y_0)$ equals $0$.**\nThe first part is technically true; for example, the fast flow is ergodic with respect to $\\delta_1$. However, the second part is false. For a fixed $\\varepsilon > 0$ and $y_0 \\neq 0$, we have $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} y^\\varepsilon(t) = \\operatorname{sgn}(y_0)$. By the Cesàro mean theorem, the limit of the time average of a function is the limit of the function itself. Therefore,\n$$\n\\lim_{T\\to\\infty}\\mathcal{A}_T^\\varepsilon(y_0) = \\lim_{T\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T y^\\varepsilon(s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} y^\\varepsilon(t) = \\operatorname{sgn}(y_0).\n$$\nSince $\\operatorname{sgn}(y_0) \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$, this limit is not $0$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. For any fixed $\\varepsilon>0$ and any initial condition $y_0\\neq 0$, one has $\\displaystyle \\lim_{T\\to\\infty}\\mathcal{A}_T^\\varepsilon(y_0)=\\operatorname{sgn}(y_0)$. Consequently, for each fixed $T>0$, $x^\\varepsilon(t)=x_0+t\\,\\operatorname{sgn}(y_0)+o(1)$ uniformly on $t\\in[0,T]$ as $\\varepsilon\\to 0$.**\nThe first part, $\\lim_{T\\to\\infty}\\mathcal{A}_T^\\varepsilon(y_0)=\\operatorname{sgn}(y_0)$, is correct as demonstrated in the analysis of option A. The second part is a statement of the Tikhonov-Krylov-Bogoliubov averaging principle for this system. We have $x^\\varepsilon(t) = x_0 + \\int_0^t y^\\varepsilon(s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s$. As $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, the integrand $y^\\varepsilon(s)$ converges pointwise for $s>0$ to $\\operatorname{sgn}(y_0)$. By the dominated convergence theorem (as $y^\\varepsilon(s)$ is uniformly bounded), we have $\\lim_{\\varepsilon\\to 0} \\int_0^t y^\\varepsilon(s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s = \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(y_0)\\,\\mathrm{d}s = t\\,\\operatorname{sgn}(y_0)$. This convergence is uniform for $t$ in a compact interval $[0,T]$. Thus, $x^\\varepsilon(t) = x_0 + t\\,\\operatorname{sgn}(y_0) + o(1)$, where the $o(1)$ term goes to $0$ uniformly on $[0,T]$. The word \"consequently\" is appropriate as the existence and value of the time average of the fast variable is the key condition for the averaging principle to yield the stated limiting slow dynamics. Both parts of the statement are correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. The set of invariant probability measures for the fast flow consists only of a unique measure; therefore, averaging yields a unique deterministic limit for $x^\\varepsilon$ independent of $y_0$.**\nThe first clause is false. As shown earlier, the set of invariant measures is the infinite set $\\mathcal{M}_{inv}$. The second clause is also false. The limiting behavior of $x^\\varepsilon(t)$ is $\\overline{x}(t) = x_0 + t\\,\\operatorname{sgn}(y_0)$, which explicitly depends on the sign of the initial condition $y_0$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. If one averages $y$ against the symmetric invariant mixture $\\mu=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\delta_{-1}+\\tfrac{1}{2}\\delta_{1}$, the predicted averaged slow dynamics is $\\dot{\\overline{x}}=0$, which disagrees with the actual limiting behavior for $y_0\\neq 0$; this exhibits failure of averaging due to nonergodicity.**\nFirst, the measure $\\mu=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\delta_{-1}+\\tfrac{1}{2}\\delta_{1}$ is indeed an invariant measure. The predicted averaged dynamics based on this measure would be $\\dot{\\overline{x}} = \\overline{h} = \\int y \\, d\\mu(y) = \\frac{1}{2} (-1) + \\frac{1}{2} (1) = 0$. This calculation is correct. This prediction, $\\dot{\\overline{x}}=0$, clearly disagrees with the actual limiting dynamics $\\dot{\\overline{x}}=\\operatorname{sgn}(y_0) \\in \\{-1,1\\}$. The reason for this failure is indeed the lack of ergodicity. The averaging principle requires convergence of time averages to the spatial average with respect to the chosen measure. For a trajectory starting at $y_0>0$, the time average is $1$, while the spatial average against $\\mu$ is $0$. This discrepancy arises because the system is not ergodic with respect to $\\mu$. The statement correctly identifies a naive application of averaging, performs the calculation, notes the discrepancy with the true limit, and correctly attributes the failure to the lack of ergodicity.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. Modifying only the slow equation by replacing $h(y)=y$ with $h_\\varepsilon(y)=y+\\varepsilon k(y)$ for a smooth $k$ restores ergodicity of the fast flow and yields initial-condition-independent time averages in the limit $\\varepsilon\\to 0$.**\nThe proposed modification changes the equation for $\\dot{x}^\\varepsilon$ to $\\dot{x}^\\varepsilon(t) = y^\\varepsilon(t) + \\varepsilon k(y^\\varepsilon(t))$. The dynamics of the fast variable $y^\\varepsilon$ are determined by the equation for $\\dot{y}^\\varepsilon$, which is left unchanged. Since the fast flow is not altered, its properties, including its lack of ergodicity, remain the same. The statement that modifying the slow equation restores ergodicity of the fast flow is fundamentally incorrect, as the $y^\\varepsilon$ dynamics are uncoupled from $x^\\varepsilon$. Consequently, the time averages will still depend on the initial condition $y_0$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",

This practice  explores the critical concept of metastability, where mixing times can be exponentially long, through the canonical double-well potential model. You will use asymptotic analysis, grounded in large deviations theory, to compute the leading-order relaxation time, connecting the spectral gap of the process to the physically intuitive Arrhenius law for rare barrier-crossing events. This demonstrates how a system, while technically mixing, can be trapped in non-equilibrium states for practical purposes.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the leading-order asymptotic expression for the mixing time of an overdamped Langevin process in a symmetric double-well potential, as the noise amplitude $\\varepsilon \\to 0$. The mixing time is defined as the inverse of the spectral gap of the generator $\\mathcal{L}$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the given potential, $V(x) = \\frac{1}{4}(x^2-1)^2$. We find its critical points by setting the derivative to zero:\n$$\nV'(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2-1)(2x) = x(x^2-1) = 0.\n$$\nThe critical points are $x=-1$, $x=0$, and $x=+1$. To classify them, we compute the second derivative:\n$$\nV''(x) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x} (x^3-x) = 3x^2-1.\n$$\nAt $x=\\pm 1$, $V''(\\pm 1) = 3(1)^2 - 1 = 2 > 0$, indicating two stable minima. Let's denote these as $x_A = -1$ and $x_B = +1$.\nAt $x=0$, $V''(0) = 3(0)^2 - 1 = -1 < 0$, indicating a local maximum, which acts as a potential barrier between the two wells. Let's denote the barrier location as $x_C = 0$.\n\nThe values of the potential at these points are:\n$V(x_A) = V(-1) = \\frac{1}{4}((-1)^2-1)^2 = 0$.\n$V(x_B) = V(+1) = \\frac{1}{4}((1)^2-1)^2 = 0$.\n$V(x_C) = V(0) = \\frac{1}{4}((0)^2-1)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe height of the potential barrier relative to the minima is $\\Delta V = V(x_C) - V(x_A) = \\frac{1}{4} - 0 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nFor small $\\varepsilon$, the invariant measure $\\mu(\\mathrm{d}x) \\propto \\exp(-V(x)/\\varepsilon)\\mathrm{d}x$ is sharply concentrated in the two potential wells around $x_A=-1$ and $x_B=+1$. The dynamics consist of fast fluctuations within each well and very rare transitions between the wells. The slowest relaxation process, which governs the overall mixing time, is the equilibration of the populations between the two wells. This time is determined by the rate of these rare inter-well transitions.\n\nThe Freidlin–Wentzell theory of large deviations states that the time for such a rare transition scales exponentially with the barrier height, which is the cornerstone of the Arrhenius law. The transition rate from well A to well B, denoted $k_{A \\to B}$, has the asymptotic form $k_{A \\to B} \\sim \\exp(-\\Delta V/\\varepsilon)$.\n\nThe spectral gap, $\\lambda_1$, of the generator $\\mathcal{L}$ is the smallest non-zero eigenvalue. For a symmetric double-well potential, this eigenvalue is associated with the anti-symmetric eigenfunction and is directly related to the sum of the transition rates between the wells: $\\lambda_1 = k_{A \\to B} + k_{B \\to A}$. Due to the symmetry of $V(x)$ about $x=0$, we have $k_{A \\to B} = k_{B \\to A} = k$. Therefore, the spectral gap is $\\lambda_1 = 2k$.\n\nThe mixing time is defined as $T_{mix} = 1/\\lambda_1$, so we have $T_{mix} = 1/(2k)$. Our task reduces to calculating the leading-order asymptotic expression for the rate $k$. We use the flux-over-population method, which leads to the well-known Kramers' rate formula.\n\nConsider a quasi-stationary state with a small, constant probability flux $J_0$ from well A to well B. The stationary Fokker-Planck equation is $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}J(x)=0$, where the current density is $J(x) = -V'(x)\\rho(x) - \\varepsilon \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\rho(x)}{\\mathrm{d}x}$. Setting $J(x)=J_0$ gives a first-order ODE for the density $\\rho(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\rho}{\\mathrm{d}x} + \\frac{V'(x)}{\\varepsilon}\\rho(x) = -\\frac{J_0}{\\varepsilon}.\n$$\nMultiplying by the integrating factor $\\exp(V(x)/\\varepsilon)$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(\\rho(x)\\exp\\left(\\frac{V(x)}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\right) = -\\frac{J_0}{\\varepsilon} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V(x)}{\\varepsilon}\\right).\n$$\nWe integrate this from a point deep in well A to a point deep in well B. For the asymptotic calculation, we integrate from the minimum $x_A$ to the other minimum $x_B$. Imposing boundary conditions corresponding to a source in well A and a sink in well B, such that $\\rho(x_B) \\approx 0$ and the population is primarily in well A, we get (after rearranging for $J_0$):\n$$\nJ_0 \\approx \\frac{\\varepsilon \\rho(x_A) \\exp(V(x_A)/\\varepsilon)}{\\int_{x_A}^{x_B} \\exp(V(y)/\\varepsilon)\\,\\mathrm{d}y}.\n$$\nThe rate is given by $k = J_0/N_A$, where $N_A$ is the equilibrium population of well A. Within the well, the density is approximately that of a local equilibrium: $\\rho(x) \\approx N_A \\frac{\\exp(-V(x)/\\varepsilon)}{\\int_{\\text{well A}} \\exp(-V(z)/\\varepsilon)\\,\\mathrm{d}z}$.\nFor small $\\varepsilon$, we evaluate the integrals using Laplace's method, based on local quadratic approximations of $V(x)$ around its minimum $x_A$ and the barrier maximum $x_C$.\n\nThe population integral in the denominator for $\\rho(x)$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\text{well A}} \\exp(-V(z)/\\varepsilon)\\,\\mathrm{d}z \\approx \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\exp\\left(-\\frac{V(x_A) + \\frac{1}{2}V''(x_A)(z-x_A)^2}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}z = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{V(x_A)}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi\\varepsilon}{V''(x_A)}}.\n$$\nThe flux integral in the denominator for $J_0$:\n$$\n\\int_{x_A}^{x_B} \\exp(V(y)/\\varepsilon)\\,\\mathrm{d}y \\approx \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\exp\\left(\\frac{V(x_C) + \\frac{1}{2}V''(x_C)(y-x_C)^2}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}y = \\exp\\left(\\frac{V(x_C)}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi\\varepsilon}{|V''(x_C)|}}.\n$$\nThe density at the minimum is $\\rho(x_A) \\approx N_A \\frac{\\exp(-V(x_A)/\\varepsilon)}{\\exp(-V(x_A)/\\varepsilon)\\sqrt{2\\pi\\varepsilon/V''(x_A)}} = N_A \\sqrt{\\frac{V''(x_A)}{2\\pi\\varepsilon}}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for the rate $k=J_0/N_A$:\n$$\nk = \\frac{1}{N_A} \\frac{\\varepsilon \\left(N_A \\sqrt{\\frac{V''(x_A)}{2\\pi\\varepsilon}}\\right) \\exp(V(x_A)/\\varepsilon)}{\\exp(V(x_C)/\\varepsilon)\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi\\varepsilon}{|V''(x_C)|}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon} \\sqrt{V''(x_A)/ (2\\pi)}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\varepsilon/|V''(x_C)|}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{V(x_C)-V(x_A)}{\\varepsilon}\\right).\n$$\n$$\nk = \\frac{\\sqrt{V''(x_A)|V''(x_C)|}}{2\\pi} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta V}{\\varepsilon}\\right).\n$$\nThis is the general one-dimensional Kramers' rate formula.
