It describes a known biochemical process—the first step of nitrification—and requests a derivation based on standard, fundamental principles of redox chemistry. All necessary information is provided, and the instructions are internally consistent and lead to a unique solution. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe task is to derive the balanced overall reaction for the oxidation of ammonia ($\\text{NH}_3$) to nitrite ($\\text{NO}_2^{-}$) by dioxygen ($\\text{O}_2$) in a neutral aqueous medium ($\\text{pH}=7$) and then to determine the number of electrons transferred per mole of ammonia, $n_e$. The prescribed method is the ion-electron method, starting in an acidic medium.\n\nFirst, we identify the two half-reactions: the oxidation of ammonia and the reduction of dioxygen.\n\nOxidation half-reaction: $\\text{NH}_3 \\rightarrow \\text{NO}_2^{-}$\nReduction half-reaction: $\\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{H}_2\\text{O}$\n\nWe will balance each half-reaction in an acidic medium, following the standard procedure.\n\nStep 1: Balance the oxidation half-reaction ($\\text{NH}_3 \\rightarrow \\text{NO}_2^{-}$) in acidic medium.\nThe initial unbalanced reaction is:\n$$\\text{NH}_3 \\rightarrow \\text{NO}_2^{-}$$\nThe nitrogen (N) atoms are already balanced, with one on each side.\nNext, we balance the oxygen (O) atoms by adding water ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$) molecules. There are two oxygen atoms on the right side and zero on the left, so we add two molecules of $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ to the left side:\n$$\\text{NH}_3 + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{NO}_2^{-}$$\nNow, we balance the hydrogen (H) atoms by adding hydrogen ions ($\\text{H}^{+}$). The left side has $3 + 2 \\times 2 = 7$ hydrogen atoms, and the right side has zero. We add seven $\\text{H}^{+}$ ions to the right side:\n$$\\text{NH}_3 + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{NO}_2^{-} + 7\\text{H}^{+}$$\nFinally, we balance the charge by adding electrons ($e^{-}$). The total charge on the left side is $0$. The total charge on the right side is $(-1) + 7(+1) = +6$. To balance the charge, we must add six electrons to the right side:\n$$\\text{NH}_3 + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{NO}_2^{-} + 7\\text{H}^{+} + 6e^{-}$$\nThis is the balanced oxidation half-reaction in acidic medium. A check of the oxidation state of nitrogen confirms this: in $\\text{NH}_3$, the oxidation state of N is $-3$; in $\\text{NO}_2^{-}$, it is $+3$. The change is $(+3) - (-3) = +6$, corresponding to the loss of six electrons.\n\nStep 2: Balance the reduction half-reaction ($\\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{H}_2\\text{O}$) in acidic medium.\nThe initial unbalanced reaction is:\n$$\\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{H}_2\\text{O}$$\nWe first balance the oxygen (O) atoms. There are two oxygen atoms on the left and one on the right, so we place a coefficient of $2$ in front of $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$:\n$$\\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$$\nNext, we balance the hydrogen (H) atoms by adding $\\text{H}^{+}$ ions. The right side has $2 \\times 2 = 4$ hydrogen atoms, and the left has zero. We add four $\\text{H}^{+}$ ions to the left side:\n$$\\text{O}_2 + 4\\text{H}^{+} \\rightarrow 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$$\nFinally, we balance the charge by adding electrons. The total charge on the left side is $4(+1) = +4$. The total charge on the right side is $0$. To balance the charge, we add four electrons to the left side:\n$$\\text{O}_2 + 4\\text{H}^{+} + 4e^{-} \\rightarrow 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$$\nThis is the balanced reduction half-reaction in acidic medium. The oxidation state of each oxygen atom changes from $0$ in $\\text{O}_2$ to $-2$ in $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$, a gain of two electrons per atom. For the two atoms in $\\text{O}_2$, the total gain is four electrons.\n\nStep 3: Combine the balanced half-reactions.\nTo obtain the overall reaction, we must ensure that the number of electrons lost in the oxidation half-reaction equals the number of electrons gained in the reduction half-reaction. The number of electrons is $6$ in the oxidation half-reaction and $4$ in the reduction half-reaction. The least common multiple of $6$ and $4$ is $12$.\nWe multiply the oxidation half-reaction by $2$:\n$$2(\\text{NH}_3 + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{NO}_2^{-} + 7\\text{H}^{+} + 6e^{-}) \\implies 2\\text{NH}_3 + 4\\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow 2\\text{NO}_2^{-} + 14\\text{H}^{+} + 12e^{-}$$\nWe multiply the reduction half-reaction by $3$:\n$$3(\\text{O}_2 + 4\\text{H}^{+} + 4e^{-} \\rightarrow 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O}) \\implies 3\\text{O}_2 + 12\\text{H}^{+} + 12e^{-} \\rightarrow 6\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$$\nNow we add the two adjusted half-reactions:\n$$(2\\text{NH}_3 + 4\\text{H}_2\\text{O}) + (3\\text{O}_2 + 12\\text{H}^{+} + 12e^{-}) \\rightarrow (2\\text{NO}_2^{-} + 14\\text{H}^{+} + 12e^{-}) + (6\\text{H}_2\\text{O})$$\nWe cancel species that appear on both sides. The $12e^{-}$ on each side cancel. We have $12\\text{H}^{+}$ on the left and $14\\text{H}^{+}$ on the right, leaving $2\\text{H}^{+}$ on the right. We have $4\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ on the left and $6\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ on the right, leaving $2\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ on the right. The resulting balanced equation in acidic medium is:\n$$2\\text{NH}_3 + 3\\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\text{NO}_2^{-} + 2\\text{H}^{+} + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$$\nA check shows that all atoms (N, H, O) and the net charge ($0$ on both sides) are balanced.\n\nStep 4: Convert the equation to neutral conditions.\nThe problem requires the final equation to be valid for a neutral medium ($\\text{pH}=7$), with no free hydrogen ions. To neutralize the $2\\text{H}^{+}$ on the right side, we add two hydroxide ions ($2\\text{OH}^{-}$) to both sides of the equation:\n$$2\\text{NH}_3 + 3\\text{O}_2 + 2\\text{OH}^{-} \\rightarrow 2\\text{NO}_2^{-} + 2\\text{H}^{+} + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} + 2\\text{OH}^{-}$$\nOn the right side, the $2\\text{H}^{+}$ and $2\\text{OH}^{-}$ combine to form two additional water molecules ($2\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$):\n$$2\\text{NH}_3 + 3\\text{O}_2 + 2\\text{OH}^{-} \\rightarrow 2\\text{NO}_2^{-} + (2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O})$$\nSimplifying the expression for water on the right gives the final balanced overall equation under conditions where no free $\\text{H}^{+}$ is present:\n$$2\\text{NH}_3 + 3\\text{O}_2 + 2\\text{OH}^{-} \\rightarrow 2\\text{NO}_2^{-} + 4\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$$\nThis equation is balanced for all atoms ($2$ N, $8$ H, $8$ O on each side) and charge ($-2$ on each side), and it has integer coefficients. It is the formal representation of the reaction at neutral $\\text{pH}$ according to the specified procedure.\n\nStep 5: Determine the number of electrons transferred per mole of ammonia ($n_e$).\nThe number of electrons transferred, $n_e$, can be determined from the balanced oxidation half-reaction:\n$$\\text{NH}_3 + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{NO}_2^{-} + 7\\text{H}^{+} + 6e^{-}$$\nThis equation shows that for the oxidation of $1$ mole of ammonia ($\\text{NH}_3$), $6$ moles of electrons are transferred.\nAlternatively, the overall process involved the transfer of $12$ electrons for the oxidation of $2$ moles of ammonia. The number of electrons per mole of ammonia is therefore $\\frac{12}{2} = 6$.\nThis is also confirmed by the change in the oxidation state of the nitrogen atom, from $-3$ in $\\text{NH}_3$ to $+3$ in $\\text{NO}_2^{-}$, which is a net change of $6$.\nThus, the number of electrons transferred per mole of ammonia oxidized is $6$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "2598535"}, {"introduction": "Standard reduction potentials, $E^{\\circ}$, provide an invaluable reference, but biological processes rarely occur under standard conditions of unit activity.
