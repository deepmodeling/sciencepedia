The SID remains unchanged. The new equilibrium state is described by the equation derived in Task 1(ii), where we must find the new value of $h$ that satisfies $F(h)=0$:\n$$F(h) = \\mathrm{SID}_{\\text{initial}} + h - \\frac{K_w}{h} - \\frac{C_T K_c}{h+K_c} - \\frac{P_T(h+2K_p)}{h+K_p} - \\frac{A_T K_a}{h+K_a} = 0$$\nWe have all the parameter values:\n- $\\mathrm{SID}_{\\text{initial}} = 0.039264\\,\\mathrm{M}$\n- $K_w = 1.0 \\times 10^{-14}$\n- $C_T = 0.010\\,\\mathrm{M}$, $K_c = 10^{-6.10}$\n- $P_T = 0.020\\,\\mathrm{M}$, $K_p = 10^{-7.20}$\n- $A_T = 0.0050\\,\\mathrm{M}$, $K_a = 10^{-4.76}$\n\nThis equation must be solved numerically for $h$. The function $F(h)$ is monotonically increasing with $h$. We seek the root of $F(h)$. The addition of an acid will lower the pH, so the final $h$ will be greater than the initial $h = 10^{-7.20}$. Let's test values:\n- At $\\mathrm{pH}=6.85$ ($h \\approx 1.413 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{M}$), $F(h) \\approx -0.000359$.\n- At $\\mathrm{pH}=6.82$ ($h \\approx 1.514 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{M}$), $F(h) \\approx +0.000025$.\n\nSince $F(h)$ changes sign between these two pH values, the root lies between them. Linear interpolation suggests the root is much closer to $h = 1.514 \\times 10^{-7}$.\nLet's check $h \\approx 1.507 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{M}$, which corresponds to $\\mathrm{pH} \\approx 6.822$.\n$F(1.507 \\times 10^{-7}) \\approx 0.039264 - 0.039266 \\approx -2 \\times 10^{-6}$.\nThis is extremely close to zero. The final hydrogen ion concentration is $h_{\\text{final}} \\approx 1.507 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\nThe final pH is therefore:\n$$\\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{final}} = -\\log_{10}(h_{\\text{final}}) = -\\log_{10}(1.507 \\times 10^{-7}) \\approx 6.8219$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested gives a final pH of $6.82$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.82}$$", "id": "2546215"}]}
