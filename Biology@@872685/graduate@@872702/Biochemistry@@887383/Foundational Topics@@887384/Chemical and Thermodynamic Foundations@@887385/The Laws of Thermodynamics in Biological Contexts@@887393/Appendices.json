The assumptions provided are standard for analyzing protein unfolding thermodynamics over a narrow temperature range. Thus, validation is passed, and we may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part calculation based on fundamental thermodynamic principles.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the van 't Hoff Equation**\n\nWe begin with the two fundamental expressions for the standard Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G^\\circ$, which are provided in the problem statement:\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\circ = \\Delta H^\\circ - T \\Delta S^\\circ\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\circ = -R T \\ln K\n$$\nHere, $\\Delta H^\\circ$ is the standard enthalpy change, $\\Delta S^\\circ$ is the standard entropy change, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $K$ is the equilibrium constant.\n\nBy equating these two expressions, we obtain a relationship between the equilibrium constant and the standard thermodynamic state functions:\n$$\n-R T \\ln K = \\Delta H^\\circ - T \\Delta S^\\circ\n$$\nTo facilitate differentiation with respect to temperature, we rearrange this equation to isolate the term $\\ln K$:\n$$\n\\ln K = -\\frac{\\Delta H^\\circ}{R T} + \\frac{\\Delta S^\\circ}{R}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the assumption that over the narrow temperature range in question, both $\\Delta H^\\circ$ and $\\Delta S^\\circ$ are effectively constant. This is equivalent to stating that the change in standard heat capacity, $\\Delta C_p^\\circ$, is negligible. We now differentiate the expression for $\\ln K$ with respect to temperature $T$:\n$$\n\\frac{d(\\ln K)}{dT} = \\frac{d}{dT} \\left( -\\frac{\\Delta H^\\circ}{R T} + \\frac{\\Delta S^\\circ}{R} \\right)\n$$\nApplying the rules of differentiation, and treating $\\Delta H^\\circ$, $\\Delta S^\\circ$, and $R$ as constants:\n$$\n\\frac{d(\\ln K)}{dT} = -\\frac{\\Delta H^\\circ}{R} \\frac{d}{dT} \\left( \\frac{1}{T} \\right) + \\frac{d}{dT} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta S^\\circ}{R} \\right)\n$$\nThe derivative of $\\frac{1}{T}$ with respect to $T$ is $-\\frac{1}{T^2}$, and the derivative of the constant term $\\frac{\\Delta S^\\circ}{R}$ is $0$. Substituting these results gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d(\\ln K)}{dT} = -\\frac{\\Delta H^\\circ}{R} \\left( -\\frac{1}{T^2} \\right) + 0\n$$\nThis simplifies to the required differential relation, known as the van 't Hoff equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d(\\ln K)}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta H^\\circ}{R T^2}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Estimation of the Derivative**\n\nThe problem asks for an estimate of the derivative $\\left.\\frac{d \\ln K}{dT}\\right|_{T=325\\,\\mathrm{K}}$ using a central finite difference. The general formula for a central difference approximation of a derivative of a function $f(x)$ at a point $x_0$ is:\n$$\nf'(x_0) \\approx \\frac{f(x_0+h) - f(x_0-h)}{2h}\n$$\nIn our case, the function is $f(T) = \\ln K(T)$, the point of interest is $T_0 = 325\\,\\mathrm{K}$, and the step size $h$ is $5\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The surrounding data points are at $T_0+h = 330\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and $T_0-h = 320\\,\\mathrm{K}$.
