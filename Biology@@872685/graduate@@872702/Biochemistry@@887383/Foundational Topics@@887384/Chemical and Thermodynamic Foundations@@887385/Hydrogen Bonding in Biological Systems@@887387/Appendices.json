It is based on established principles of biophysical chemistry, specifically the use of thermodynamic cycles to dissect interaction energies. The double-mutant cycle is a standard and rigorous method for quantifying non-additive energetic coupling between two sites. All necessary data are provided, the terminology is precise, and the given free energy values are physically realistic for protein-ligand binding. The problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be furnished.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires the design of a double-mutant cycle and the calculation of a coupling free energy, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coupling}}$, from provided data.\n\nFirst, the experimental design. A double-mutant cycle requires the study of four systems to isolate the interaction between two specific groups. In this context, the two groups are the hydrogen-bond donor on the ligand and the hydrogen-bond acceptor on the protein. The four necessary constructs are precisely those for which data are provided:\n$1$. The wild-type protein binding to the wild-type ligand: ($\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}}, \\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$). This is the reference system where the hydrogen bond is intact.\n$2$. The mutant protein (acceptor removed) binding to the wild-type ligand: ($\\mathrm{P}^{\\ast}, \\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$). This system measures the energetic cost of removing the protein's acceptor.\n$3$. The wild-type protein binding to the mutant ligand (donor removed): ($\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}}, \\mathrm{L}^{\\ast}$). This system measures the energetic cost of removing the ligand's donor.\n$4$. The mutant protein binding to the mutant ligand: ($\\mathrm{P}^{\\ast}, \\mathrm{L}^{\\ast}$). This system measures the \"intrinsic\" binding affinity in the absence of both interacting groups.\n\nThe single thermodynamic measurement to be made on each of these four constructs is the standard Gibbs free energy of binding, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}$. As stated in the problem, a method such as Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) is suitable for this purpose, as it can directly yield the association constant $K_a$, from which $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}$ is calculated via the relation $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}} = -RT\\ln K_{a}$. The problem specifies that the wild-type/wild-type system, ($\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}}, \\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$), serves as the reference against which the effects of the mutations are assessed.\n\nThe core principle for calculating the coupling energy is that the Gibbs free energy is a state function. This allows us to construct a thermodynamic cycle where the net change in free energy around the cycle is zero. The cycle connects the four binding equilibria:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}} \\cdot \\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}}  \\xrightarrow{\\quad \\Delta G_{L|P_{WT}} \\quad}  \\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}} \\cdot \\mathrm{L}^{\\ast} \\\\\n\\llap{\\scriptsize{\\Delta G_{P|L_{WT}}}}\\Big\\downarrow   \\Big\\downarrow\\rlap{\\scriptsize{\\Delta G_{P|L_{mut}}}} \\\\\n\\mathrm{P}^{\\ast} \\cdot \\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}}  \\xrightarrow{\\quad \\Delta G_{L|P_{mut}} \\quad}  \\mathrm{P}^{\\ast} \\cdot \\mathrm{L}^{\\ast}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nHere, the states are the protein-ligand complexes, and the arrows represent the free energy changes associated with mutating one component while the other is held constant. For example, $\\Delta G_{L|P_{WT}}$ is the change in binding free energy upon mutating the ligand ($\\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{L}^{\\ast}$) while it is bound to the wild-type protein ($\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$).\n\nThe coupling free energy, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coupling}}$, is the measure of non-additivity. It quantifies how the energetic effect of one mutation is altered by the presence of the other mutation. Mathematically, it is the difference between the effect of a mutation in the wild-type background and its effect in the mutant background.\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coupling}} = \\Delta G_{L|P_{mut}} - \\Delta G_{L|P_{WT}} $$\nThe individual free energy changes, representing the horizontal arrows in the diagram, are calculated from the measured binding free energies:\n$$ \\Delta G_{L|P_{WT}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}},\\mathrm{L}^{\\ast}) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}},\\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}}) $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{L|P_{mut}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\ast},\\mathrm{L}^{\\ast}) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\ast},\\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}}) $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coupling}}$ yields:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coupling}} = \\left( \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\ast},\\mathrm{L}^{\\ast}) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\ast},\\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}}) \\right) - \\left( \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}},\\mathrm{L}^{\\ast}) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}},\\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}}) \\right) $$\nRearranging this expression gives the standard formula for coupling energy:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coupling}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}},\\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}}) + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\ast},\\mathrm{L}^{\\ast}) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\ast},\\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}}) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}},\\mathrm{L}^{\\ast}) $$\nNote that due to the cyclic nature of the state function, the same result is obtained by considering the vertical mutations: $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coupling}} = \\Delta G_{P|L_{mut}} - \\Delta G_{P|L_{WT}}$. This is the mathematical embodiment of the validity of the cycle.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into the derived equation. All values are in units of $\\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}$.\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}},\\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}}) = -9.0 $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\ast},\\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{WT}}) = -7.5 $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\mathrm{WT}},\\mathrm{L}^{\\ast}) = -7.0 $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(\\mathrm{P}^{\\ast},\\mathrm{L}^{\\ast}) = -6.0 $$\nThe calculation is as follows:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coupling}} = (-9.0) + (-6.0) - (-7.5) - (-7.0) $$\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coupling}} = -9.0 - 6.0 + 7.5 + 7.0 $$\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coupling}} = -15.0 + 14.5 $$\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{coupling}} = -0.5 $$\nThe coupling free energy attributable to the hydrogen bond is $-0.5 \\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}$.

Solvation of the resulting base pair complex: $(XY)_{\\mathrm{gas}} \\rightarrow (XY)_{\\mathrm{aq}}$. The free energy change is $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}(XY)$.\n\nSince Gibbs free energy is a state function (Foundation i), the total free energy change for the cycle must be zero, meaning the direct path (pairing in water) must equal the indirect path (steps $1-3$):\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{aq}}(XY) = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{gas}}(XY) - (\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}(X) + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}(Y)) + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}(XY) $$\nThis can be rearranged as prescribed by Foundation (ii):\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{aq}}(XY) = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{gas}}(XY) + [\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}(XY) - (\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}(X) + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}(Y))] $$\nThe term in brackets is the net solvation contribution, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv,net}}(XY)$.\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{aq}}(XY) = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{gas}}(XY) + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv,net}}(XY) $$\n\nWe are asked to find $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{aq}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{aq}}(\\mathrm{G{:}C}) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{aq}}(\\mathrm{A{:}T})$.\nUsing the decomposition above:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{aq}} = [\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{gas}}(\\mathrm{G{:}C}) + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv,net}}(\\mathrm{G{:}C})] - [\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{gas}}(\\mathrm{A{:}T}) + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv,net}}(\\mathrm{A{:}T})] $$\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{aq}} = (\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{gas}}(\\mathrm{G{:}C}) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{gas}}(\\mathrm{A{:}T})) + (\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv,net}}(\\mathrm{G{:}C}) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv,net}}(\\mathrm{A{:}T})) $$\nLet us denote the two terms as $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{gas}}$ and $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv,net}}$, respectively.\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{aq}} = \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{gas}} + \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv,net}} $$\n\nFirst, we evaluate the gas-phase contribution, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{gas}}$.

Let us denote this change as $\\Delta\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{transfer}}$.\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{transfer}} = \\left(G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{H}^+,\\text{buried}} + G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{A}^-,\\text{buried}} - G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{HA},\\text{buried}}\\right) - \\left(G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{H}^+,\\text{water}} + G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{A}^-,\\text{water}} - G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{HA},\\text{water}}\\right) $$\nIn these calculations, the proton is assumed to be released into the bulk aqueous solvent, which serves as the standard reference state. Thus, the free energy of the proton is the same whether the acid is initially in water or buried, meaning $G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{H}^+,\\text{buried}} = G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{H}^+,\\text{water}}$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{transfer}} = \\left(G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{A}^-,\\text{buried}} - G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{A}^-,\\text{water}}\\right) - \\left(G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{HA},\\text{buried}} - G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{HA},\\text{water}}\\right) $$\nThis is the difference between the transfer free energies of the anion ($\\mathrm{A}^-$) and the neutral acid ($\\mathrm{HA}$) from water to the protein interior.\nThe problem states that the protonated form, $\\mathrm{HA}$, is neutral and has negligible charging free energy. We interpret this to mean that its electrostatic interaction with the dielectric medium is negligible, so its transfer free energy is approximately zero: $\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{transfer}}(\\mathrm{HA}) = G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{HA},\\text{buried}} - G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{HA},\\text{water}} \\approx 0$.\nThus, the entire pKa shift is determined by the electrostatic cost of transferring the charged anion $\\mathrm{A}^-$ from the high-dielectric water environment to the low-dielectric protein environment.\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{transfer}} \\approx G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{A}^-,\\text{buried}} - G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{A}^-,\\text{water}} = \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{transfer}}(\\mathrm{A}^-) $$\nTo calculate this transfer free energy, we use the Born model. The electrostatic self-energy, $W_{\\text{el}}$, of a spherical ion of charge $q$ and radius $a$ in a uniform dielectric medium with relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_r$ is:\n$$ W_{\\text{el}} = \\frac{q^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r a} $$\nThis energy represents the work done to constitute the charged sphere within the medium. The transfer free energy of the ion is the difference in this self-energy between the two media. For the aspartate anion $\\mathrm{A}^-$, the charge is $q = -e$, so $q^2 = e^2$.\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{transfer}}(\\mathrm{A}^-) = W_{\\text{el, buried}} - W_{\\text{el, water}} = \\frac{e^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_\\text{in} a} - \\frac{e^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_\\text{w} a} $$\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{transfer}}(\\mathrm{A}^-) = \\frac{e^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0 a} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_\\text{in}} - \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_\\text{w}}\\right) $$\nThis is the energy change per ion. To obtain the molar Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{molar}}$, we must multiply by Avogadro's number, $N_\\text{A}$.\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{molar}} = N_\\text{A} \\frac{e^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0 a} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_\\text{in}} - \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_\\text{w}}\\right) $$\nSubstituting this into our expression for the $\\mathrm{p}K_\\mathrm{a}$ shift gives the final symbolic formula:\n$$ \\Delta \\mathrm{p}K_\\mathrm{a} = \\frac{N_\\text{A} e^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0 a RT \\ln 10} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_\\text{in}} - \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_\\text{w}}\\right) $$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values, ensuring all are in base SI units.\n$a = 2 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\text{m}$.\n$\\varepsilon_\\text{in} = 4$.\n$\\varepsilon_\\text{w} = 78.5$.\n$T = 298\\,\\text{K}$.\n$\\varepsilon_0 = 8.8541878128\\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{C}^2\\,\\text{J}^{-1}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$.\n$e = 1.602176634\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{C}$.\n$N_\\text{A} = 6.02214076\\times 10^{23}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$.\n$R = 8.314462618\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the constant prefactor term:\n$$ \\frac{N_\\text{A} e^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0 a} = \\frac{(6.02214076\\times 10^{23}) (1.602176634\\times 10^{-19})^2}{8\\pi (8.8541878128\\times 10^{-12}) (2 \\times 10^{-10})} \\approx 347392.5\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} $$\nNext, we calculate the thermal energy term:\n$$ RT \\ln 10 = (8.314462618) (298) \\ln(10) \\approx 5705.85\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} $$\nAnd the dielectric term:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_\\text{in}} - \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_\\text{w}}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{78.5}\\right) \\approx 0.25 - 0.01273885 \\approx 0.23726115 $$\nCombining these components:\n$$ \\Delta \\mathrm{p}K_\\mathrm{a} = \\frac{347392.5}{5705.85} \\times 0.23726115 \\approx 60.883 \\times 0.23726115 \\approx 14.4462 $$\nThe positive sign indicates that the $\\mathrm{p}K_\\mathrm{a}$ is higher in the low-dielectric protein interior, meaning deprotonation is less favorable, which is physically correct.\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required by the problem statement gives $14.45$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{14.45}$$", "id": "2571332"}]}
