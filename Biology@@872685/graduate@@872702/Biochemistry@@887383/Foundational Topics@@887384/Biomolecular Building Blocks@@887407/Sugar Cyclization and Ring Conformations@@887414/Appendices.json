Therefore, we proceed with the derivation and calculation as requested.\n\nThe first task is to derive the relationship between the standard Gibbs energy change, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$, and the equilibrium constant, $K$. We begin from first principles.\n\nLet the open-chain form be denoted by $O$ and the cyclic form by $C$. The isomerization reaction is:\n$$\nO \\rightleftharpoons C\n$$\nThe chemical potential, $\\mu_i$, of a species $i$ in an ideal dilute solution is given by:\n$$\n\\mu_i = \\mu_i^{\\circ} + RT \\ln \\left( \\frac{[i]}{c^{\\circ}} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_i^{\\circ}$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $[i]$ is the molar concentration of species $i$, and $c^{\\circ}$ is the standard state concentration, which is $1\\ \\mathrm{M}$.

The language is objective and precise. The data are internally consistent. The provided A-value for the methoxy group is extraneous but does not create a contradiction. The instruction to round to three significant figures based on input data with one significant figure is numerically questionable, but it is an explicit instruction, not a flaw that invalidates the problem itself.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**.

The large $-\\mathrm{CH}_{2}\\mathrm{OH}$ group at carbon $\\mathrm{C5}$ of a D-sugar adopts the equatorial position in the stable $^{4}C_{1}$ chair.\nThe orientations for the hydroxyl groups in $\\beta$-D-glucopyranose are:\n- $\\mathrm{C1-OH}$: equatorial ($\\beta$-anomer)\n- $\\mathrm{C2-OH}$: equatorial\n- $\\mathrm{C3-OH}$: equatorial\n- $\\mathrm{C4-OH}$: equatorial\n- $\\mathrm{C5-CH}_{2}\\mathrm{OH}$: equatorial\n\nThe problem states that D-mannose is the C-2 epimer of D-glucose.

It must be noted that this calculation neglects the anomeric effect, which would provide additional stabilization to the $\\alpha$-anomer, where the electronegative anomeric substituent is axial, thus counteracting the steric penalty calculated here.
