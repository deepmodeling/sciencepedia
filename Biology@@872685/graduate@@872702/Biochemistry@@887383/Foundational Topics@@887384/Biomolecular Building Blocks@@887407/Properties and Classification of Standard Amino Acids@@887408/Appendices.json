All necessary data, specifically the acid dissociation constants ($pK_a$) for the three titratable groups of histidine, are provided. The problem is a standard exercise in biochemistry and physical chemistry, solvable through the application of fundamental principles of acid-base equilibria. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe amino acid histidine possesses three ionizable groups: the $\\alpha$-carboxyl group ($pK_{a1} = 1.80$), the imidazole side chain ($pK_{a2} = 6.04$), and the $\\alpha$-amino group ($pK_{a3} = 9.33$). Let us denote the various protonated forms of histidine as $H_3A^{2+}$, $H_2A^{+}$, $HA^0$, and $A^{-}$. The ionization states change sequentially as the $pH$ of the solution increases.\n\nAt a very low $pH$, all three groups are protonated. The molecule exists as $H_3A^{2+}$, with a net charge of $+2$ (from the protonated amino group, $+1$, and the protonated imidazole ring, $+1$).\n\nThe first deprotonation event occurs at the most acidic group, the $\\alpha$-carboxyl group, and is governed by $pK_{a1}$:\n$$H_3A^{2+} \\rightleftharpoons H_2A^{+} + H^+ \\quad (pK_{a1} = 1.80)$$\nThe resulting species, $H_2A^{+}$, has a net charge of $+1$ (from the protonated amino group, $+1$, the protonated imidazole ring, $+1$, and the deprotonated carboxylate group, $-1$).\n\nThe second deprotonation occurs at the imidazole side chain, governed by $pK_{a2}$:\n$$H_2A^{+} \\rightleftharpoons HA^{0} + H^+ \\quad (pK_{a2} = 6.04)$$\nThe resulting species, $HA^0$, has a net charge of $0$. This is the zwitterionic or electrically neutral microstate. The charges of its functional groups are: protonated amino group ($+1$), neutral imidazole ring ($0$), and deprotonated carboxylate group ($-1$).\n\nThe third deprotonation occurs at the least acidic group, the $\\alpha$-amino group, and is governed by $pK_{a3}$:\n$$HA^{0} \\rightleftharpoons A^{-} + H^+ \\quad (pK_{a3} = 9.33)$$\nThe resulting species, $A^{-}$, has a net charge of $-1$ (from the deprotonated carboxylate group).\n\nThe isoelectric point ($pI$) is the $pH$ at which the average net charge of the population of molecules is zero. The electrically neutral species $HA^0$ is formed from $H_2A^{+}$ and dissociates into $A^{-}$. Therefore, the two equilibria that \"straddle\" the neutral species are those described by $K_{a2}$ and $K_{a3}$. The corresponding $pK_a$ values are $pK_{a2} = 6.04$ and $pK_{a3} = 9.33$.\n\nAt the $pI$, the total concentration of positive charges must equal the total concentration of negative charges. In this system, this condition is formally written as:\n$$2[H_3A^{2+}] + [H_2A^{+}] = [A^{-}]$$\nHowever, because the $pI$ will be significantly higher than $pK_{a1}$ ($1.80$), the concentration of the doubly-positive species, $[H_3A^{2+}]$, will be negligible compared to the concentration of the singly-positive species, $[H_2A^{+}]$. Thus, the condition for the isoelectric point can be simplified to a very good approximation:\n$$[H_2A^{+}] \\approx [A^{-}]$$\nThis approximation states that at the $pI$, the concentrations of the charged species immediately adjacent to the zwitterion are equal.\n\nWe now use the law of mass action for the two relevant equilibria, expressed via their acid dissociation constants, $K_{a2}$ and $K_{a3}$:\n$$K_{a2} = \\frac{[HA^0][H^+]}{[H_2A^{+}]} \\implies [H_2A^{+}] = \\frac{[HA^0][H^+]}{K_{a2}}$$\n$$K_{a3} = \\frac{[A^{-}][H^+]}{[HA^0]} \\implies [A^{-}] = \\frac{K_{a3}[HA^0]}{[H^+]}$$\nWe substitute these expressions into our simplified charge balance equation, $[H_2A^{+}] = [A^{-}]$:\n$$\\frac{[HA^0][H^+]}{K_{a2}} = \\frac{K_{a3}[HA^0]}{[H^+]}$$\nThe concentration of the neutral species, $[HA^0]$, is non-zero at the $pI$ and can be cancelled from both sides of the equation:\n$$\\frac{[H^+]}{K_{a2}} = \\frac{K_{a3}}{[H^+]}$$\nLet $[H^+]_{pI}$ be the hydrogen ion concentration at the isoelectric point. Rearranging the equation to solve for $[H^+]_{pI}$:\n$$[H^+]_{pI}^2 = K_{a2} K_{a3}$$\n$$[H^+]_{pI} = \\sqrt{K_{a2} K_{a3}}$$\nTo find the $pI$, we take the negative base-10 logarithm of both sides.

Let the two identical lysine side chains be sites $1$ and $2$. Each site can be in one of two states: protonated ($\\mathrm{P}$) or deprotonated ($\\mathrm{D}$).

The net charge from the side chains is $0$. There is no electrostatic interaction between them. We take this as the reference state and assign it a statistical weight of $1$.\n- States $(\\mathrm{P,D})$ and $(\\mathrm{D,P})$: One site is protonated ($-\\mathrm{NH_3^+}$) and one is deprotonated. The net charge from the side chains is $+1$. Since the sites are identical and the problem statement specifies the interaction is only between two protonated groups, there is no interaction energy term here beyond the intrinsic binding energy.\n- State $(\\mathrm{P,P})$: Both sites are protonated. The net charge from the side chains is $+2$. The two positive charges interact via the screened Coulomb potential, giving rise to a repulsive energy $U$.\n\nThe statistical weight of a state is related to its free energy. Let's define a proton binding factor, $x$, which is related to the intrinsic tendency of a site to be protonated at a given $\\mathrm{pH}$. For the equilibrium $\\mathrm{D} + \\mathrm{H}^+ \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{P}$, the intrinsic association constant is $K_{a,0}^{-1}$, where $K_{a,0} = 10^{-pK_0}$. The free energy of binding a proton from the solution is $\\Delta G = RT \\ln(10) (\\mathrm{pH} - pK_0)$.

This negative sign is physically correct, as higher ionic strength ($I_2$) leads to stronger screening (larger $\\kappa$), weaker repulsion (smaller $u$), and thus a higher midpoint $\\mathrm{pH}$ compared to the lower ionic strength ($I_1$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.07369}$$", "id": "2590641"}]}
