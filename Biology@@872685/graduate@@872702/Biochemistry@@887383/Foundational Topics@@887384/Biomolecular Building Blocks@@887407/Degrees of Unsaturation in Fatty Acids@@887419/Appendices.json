We must begin with a rigorous, first-principles derivation as instructed.\n\nThe degree of unsaturation (DoU), also known as the hydrogen deficiency index (HDI), represents the number of rings and/or multiple bonds present in a molecule. It is calculated by comparing the number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule to the number of hydrogen atoms in a corresponding saturated, acyclic reference compound. For a molecule with a chemical formula $C_c H_h O_o$, the degree of unsaturation is given by the formula:\n$$ \\text{DoU} = c - \\frac{h}{2} + 1 $$\nOxygen atoms are divalent and do not affect the hydrogen count relative to a saturated hydrocarbon backbone, thus they do not appear explicitly in this standard formula.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation starting from a saturated, acyclic, monocarboxylic fatty acid. Let us first establish the reference state. A saturated, acyclic alkane containing $n$ carbon atoms has the molecular formula $C_n H_{2n+2}$. This formula represents the maximum possible number of hydrogen atoms for $n$ carbons in an acyclic structure.\n\nNow, consider a saturated, acyclic, monocarboxylic fatty acid with $n$ total carbon atoms. Such a molecule is formed from the corresponding alkane structure but contains one carboxyl group ($-COOH$). The carboxyl group contains one carbon-oxygen double bond ($C=O$). The presence of any double bond or ring structure reduces the hydrogen count by $2$ relative to the saturated acyclic alkane. Therefore, a saturated fatty acid, which contains one $C=O$ double bond and no other multiple bonds or rings, must have $2$ fewer hydrogen atoms than the corresponding alkane.\n\nThe number of hydrogens in a saturated fatty acid with $n$ carbons is therefore $(2n+2) - 2 = 2n$. The molecular formula for such a saturated fatty acid is $C_n H_{2n} O_2$. We can verify its degree of unsaturation using the standard formula:\n$$ \\text{DoU}_{\\text{saturated fatty acid}} = n - \\frac{2n}{2} + 1 = n - n + 1 = 1 $$\nThis result confirms that a saturated fatty acid has a degree of unsaturation of $1$, which is solely attributable to the carbonyl double bond within the carboxyl group.\n\nThe problem specifies a fatty acid with $u$ carbon-carbon double bonds ($C=C$) in its hydrocarbon chain. Each introduction of a $C=C$ double bond requires the removal of two hydrogen atoms from the carbon chain. Therefore, starting from our saturated fatty acid formula $C_n H_{2n} O_2$, we must subtract $2u$ hydrogen atoms to account for the $u$ double bonds.\n\nThe number of hydrogen atoms in the unsaturated fatty acid is $h = 2n - 2u$.\nThe general molecular formula for an acyclic, monocarboxylic fatty acid with $n$ carbons and $u$ carbon-carbon double bonds is thus $C_n H_{2n-2u} O_2$.\n\nNow, we compute the degree of unsaturation for this general molecule:\n$$ \\text{DoU} = c - \\frac{h}{2} + 1 $$\nSubstituting $c=n$ and $h=2n-2u$:\n$$ \\text{DoU} = n - \\frac{2n - 2u}{2} + 1 $$\n$$ \\text{DoU} = n - (n - u) + 1 $$\n$$ \\text{DoU} = n - n + u + 1 $$\n$$ \\text{DoU} = u + 1 $$\nThis result is logically consistent. The total degree of unsaturation is the sum of all rings and multiple bonds. In our acyclic molecule, there are no rings. There are $u$ carbon-carbon double bonds and $1$ carbon-oxygen double bond. The total count is $u+1$, which matches our derived formula precisely.\n\nThe fatty acid in the problem is specified by the shorthand $18:3$.\nThis notation gives:\n- The total number of carbon atoms, $n = 18$.\n- The number of carbon-carbon double bonds, $u = 3$.\n\nSubstituting $u=3$ into our derived expression for the degree of unsaturation:\n$$ \\text{DoU} = 3 + 1 = 4 $$\n\nThe degree of unsaturation for the fatty acid $18:3$ is $4$. This value accounts for the three carbon-carbon double bonds and the one carbon-oxygen double bond of the carboxyl group.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4}\n$$", "id": "2563729"}, {"introduction": "Modern analytical techniques like mass spectrometry often yield data on complex mixtures of lipids, frequently reported as sum compositions. Interpreting this data requires translating the properties of single molecules to the average properties of an ensemble, a key step in systems-level analysis.

The colon annotation $C:U$ is the laboratory convention used to denote $C$ total carbon atoms across all fatty acyl chains esterified to a single glycerol backbone and $U$ total carbon–carbon double bonds across those same acyl chains. Assume that each molecular species in this set is a diacyl glycerophospholipid (that is, it contains exactly $2$ fatty acyl chains connected by ester linkages), and that there are no ether or vinyl ether (plasmalogen) linkages and no rings in the acyl chains. You may also assume that any unsaturation or cyclic structure present in the headgroup or glycerol backbone, if chemically present, is not included by this convention in the reported $U$ value.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definition that the degree of unsaturation for a hydrocarbon chain without rings equals the number of carbon–carbon double bonds in that chain, determine the average degree of unsaturation per acyl chain, denoted $\\bar{u}$, across the entire mixture.

It contains sufficient information for a unique and meaningful solution. The assumptions provided—that the lipids are diacyl, contain no rings in the acyl chains, and that headgroup unsaturation is excluded from the notation—are standard simplifications in the field of lipidomics and do not introduce any scientific inconsistencies. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nLet the three glycerophospholipid molecular species be indexed by $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. The sum composition for each species is given by the notation $C_i:U_i$, where $C_i$ is the total number of carbon atoms in the acyl chains and $U_i$ is the total number of carbon-carbon double bonds in the acyl chains of a single molecule. The problem states that for a hydrocarbon chain without rings, the degree of unsaturation is equal to the number of double bonds. Thus, $U_i$ represents the molecular degree of unsaturation contributed by the acyl chains for molecule $i$.\n\nThe given species are:\n- Species $1$: $34:1$, which implies a molecular unsaturation of $U_1 = 1$.\n- Species $2$: $36:2$, which implies a molecular unsaturation of $U_2 = 2$.\n- Species $3$: $38:4$, which implies a molecular unsaturation of $U_3 = 4$.\n\nThe mixture is described as equimolar. This implies that in any representative sample of the mixture, the number of moles, and thus molecules, of each species is equal. Let us consider a sample containing $N$ molecules of species $1$, $N$ molecules of species $2$, and $N$ molecules of species $3$. The total number of glycerophospholipid molecules in this sample is:\n$$N_{mol} = N + N + N = 3N$$\n\nThe problem specifies that each molecular species is a diacyl glycerophospholipid, which means each molecule contains exactly $k=2$ fatty acyl chains. The total number of acyl chains, $N_{chains}$, in the sample is therefore the product of the total number of molecules and the number of chains per molecule:\n$$N_{chains} = N_{mol} \\times k = (3N) \\times 2 = 6N$$\n\nThis step explicitly relates the molecular count to the chain count, as requested.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of unsaturations (double bonds) in the entire sample, $U_{total}$. This is the sum of the unsaturations contributed by all molecules of each species.\nThe total unsaturations from the $N$ molecules of species $1$ is $N \\times U_1 = N \\times 1 = N$.\nThe total unsaturations from the $N$ molecules of species $2$ is $N \\times U_2 = N \\times 2 = 2N$.\nThe total unsaturations from the $N$ molecules of species $3$ is $N \\times U_3 = N \\times 4 = 4N$.\n\nSumming these contributions gives the total number of unsaturations in the mixture:\n$$U_{total} = (N \\times U_1) + (N \\times U_2) + (N \\times U_3) = N(U_1 + U_2 + U_3)$$\nSubstituting the given values for $U_i$:\n$$U_{total} = N(1 + 2 + 4) = 7N$$\n\nThe objective is to find the average degree of unsaturation per acyl chain, denoted $\\bar{u}$. This is defined as the ratio of the total number of unsaturations in the mixture to the total number of acyl chains in the mixture.\n$$\\bar{u} = \\frac{U_{total}}{N_{chains}}$$\n\nThe averaging process is justified by this ratio of total quantities. We have aggregated the total chain count ($6N$) and the total unsaturation count ($7N$) over the entire mixture.
