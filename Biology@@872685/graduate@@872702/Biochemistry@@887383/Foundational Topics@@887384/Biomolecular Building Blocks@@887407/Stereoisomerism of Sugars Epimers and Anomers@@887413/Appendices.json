The description of $\\mathrm{D}$-glucose is accurate. The student's claims, while incorrect, represent common misconceptions, making them a valid basis for a problem designed to test understanding of these principles. The problem is well-posed, asking for an evaluation of provided options against established scientific facts. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and does not violate any scientific laws or contain internal contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nFirst, each of the student's rules must be analyzed for its scientific validity.\n\n-   **Student Rule (i):** \"In the Haworth projection for $\\mathrm{D}$-sugars, any substituent that is on the right in the Fischer projection is drawn up.\"\n    This is incorrect. The standard convention for converting a $\\mathrm{D}$-sugar Fischer projection to a Haworth projection is that substituents on the right side of the Fischer projection are drawn *down*, and substituents on the left are drawn *up*. The terminal $CH_2OH$ group (at $C\\text{-}6$ for a hexose) on the $C\\text{-}5$ that defines the $\\mathrm{D}$-configuration is drawn *up*. The student has inverted the rule for $C\\text{-}2$, $C\\text{-}3$ and $C\\text{-}4$.\n\n-   **Student Rule (ii):** \"If the anomeric hydroxyl is axial in a chair, the anomer must be $\\alpha$.\"\n    This is a dangerous oversimplification. For D-aldohexopyranoses like $\\mathrm{D}$-glucose, this statement is true only for the more stable $^{4}C_{1}$ chair conformation. In this conformation, the $\\alpha$-anomer has an axial hydroxyl at $C\\text{-}1$, and the $\\beta$-anomer has an equatorial one. However, if the ring undergoes a \"ring flip\" to the less stable $^{1}C_{4}$ conformation, all axial and equatorial positions are inverted. The configuration ($\\alpha$ or $\\beta$) is invariant, so in the $^{1}C_{4}$ chair, the $\\alpha$-anomer's hydroxyl group becomes equatorial. Therefore, the rule is not general and depends on the specific chair conformation being depicted.\n\n-   **Student Rule (iii):** \"If the $CH_2OH$ group is up in the chair, the sugar must be $\\mathrm{D}$.\"\n    This rule is flawed. The $\\mathrm{D}/\\mathrm{L}$ designation is determined by the absolute configuration of the highest-numbered stereocenter in the open-chain Fischer projection ($C\\text{-}5$ for aldohexoses). For a $\\mathrm{D}$-sugar, the hydroxyl at this carbon is on the right. This results in the $CH_2OH$ group being \"up\" in the Haworth projection. In the most stable $^{4}C_{1}$ chair conformation of a $\\mathrm{D}$-hexopyranose, this \"up\" group is equatorial. In the $^{1}C_{4}$ conformation, it is \"up\" and axial. The term \"up\" in a chair drawing is relative and not a rigorous determinant of absolute configuration without further context. The fundamental definition is what must be used.\n\n-   **Student Rule (iv):** \"In a furanose ring formed from $\\mathrm{D}$-glucose, the anomeric carbon is $C\\text{-}2$.\"\n    This is incorrect. The anomeric carbon is, by definition, the carbon atom that was the carbonyl carbon in the open-chain form. For an aldose like glucose, the carbonyl group is the aldehyde at $C\\text{-}1$. Therefore, the anomeric carbon is $C\\text{-}1$ regardless of whether a five-membered (furanose) or six-membered (pyranose) ring is formed. The anomeric carbon is $C\\text{-}2$ for ketoses like fructose, where the carbonyl group is a ketone at the $C\\text{-}2$ position.\n\n-   **Student Rule (v):** \"When converting a Haworth projection of a pyranose to a chair, any substituent drawn down in Haworth should be made axial in the chair.\"\n    This is completely incorrect. In a chair conformation, whether a substituent is axial or equatorial depends on its position on the ring and whether it is \"up\" or \"down\". In a standard $^{4}C_{1}$ chair, \"down\" substituents are alternately axial and equatorial around the ring: axial at $C\\text{-}1$, equatorial at $C\\text{-}2$, axial at $C\\text{-}3$, equatorial at $C\\text{-}4$, and axial at $C\\text{-}5$. A single rule cannot apply to all positions.\n\nNow, we evaluate each of the proposed corrections.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. For $\\mathrm{D}$-aldopyranoses, groups on the right in the Fischer projection map down in the Haworth projection, and groups on the left map up; $\\alpha/\\beta$ is then assigned by the relative orientation of the anomeric substituent to the $CH_2OH$ at $C\\text{-}5$ in the ring.**\nThe first part of this statement, \"groups on the right in the Fischer projection map down in the Haworth projection, and groups on the left map up,\" is the correct rule for converting Fischer to Haworth projections for $\\mathrm{D}$-sugars. This directly and accurately corrects student rule (i). The second part states that $\\alpha/\\beta$ can be assigned based on the relationship between the anomeric substituent and the $CH_2OH$ group. For $\\mathrm{D}$-sugars, the $CH_2OH$ group is \"up\". The $\\alpha$-anomer has the anomeric hydroxyl \"down\" (trans to $CH_2OH$), and the $\\beta$-anomer has it \"up\" (cis to $CH_2OH$). This is a valid and commonly used convention for assigning configuration from a Haworth projection, preventing the kind of error the student makes with rule (ii). The entire statement is scientifically correct and serves as an effective correction.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. $\\alpha/\\beta$ can be assigned by “axial equals $\\alpha$” regardless of the chair conformation; this holds across $^{4}C_{1}$ and $^{1}C_{4}$ chairs.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. As explained in the analysis of student rule (ii), the relationship \"axial equals $\\alpha$\" is only valid for the $^{4}C_{1}$ chair conformation of $\\mathrm{D}$-aldopyranoses. Upon ring inversion to the $^{1}C_{4}$ conformation, an axial group becomes equatorial and vice-versa. Since the $\\alpha$ configuration is an intrinsic property of the molecule, in the $^{1}C_{4}$ chair the $\\alpha$-anomeric hydroxyl is equatorial. This option attempts to correct a flawed rule with another, equally flawed, blanket statement.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $\\mathrm{D}/\\mathrm{L}$ is assigned by the absolute configuration at the highest-numbered stereocenter in the Fischer projection (for aldoses, $C\\text{-}5$), not by whether $CH_2OH$ happens to be up or down in a particular chair drawing.**\nThis statement provides the formal, IUPAC-sanctioned definition for the $\\mathrm{D}/\\mathrm{L}$ nomenclature of sugars. It correctly identifies the determinant as the configuration of the stereocenter furthest from the carbonyl group ($C\\text{-}5$ for D-glucose). It explicitly refutes the student's flawed, observation-based shortcut in rule (iii). This is the most robust and scientifically correct principle to prevent misassignment of $\\mathrm{D}/\\mathrm{L}$ configuration.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. In cyclic forms, the anomeric carbon is the former carbonyl carbon of the open chain. Thus, for D-glucose (an aldose), the anomeric carbon is $C\\text{-}1$ in both pyranose and furanose rings; only for ketoses such as D-fructose is the anomeric carbon $C\\text{-}2$.**\nThis statement begins with the precise definition of the anomeric carbon. It correctly applies this definition to the aldose $\\mathrm{D}$-glucose, concluding that its anomeric carbon is $C\\text{-}1$ for any ring size. It correctly contrasts this with ketoses like $\\mathrm{D}$-fructose, where the anomeric carbon is $C\\text{-}2$. This provides a complete and accurate correction to the student's erroneous claim in rule (iv).\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. When converting Haworth to a $^{4}C_{1}$ chair, place all substituents drawn down in Haworth into equatorial positions to minimize $1,3$-diaxial interactions; “down” and equatorial should coincide at every ring carbon in a correct $^{4}C_{1}$ depiction.**\nThis statement is factually wrong. As analyzed for student rule (v), the correlation between \"down\" in Haworth and axial/equatorial in the chair alternates around the ring. For a $^{4}C_{1}$ chair, a \"down\" substituent is axial at $C\\text{-}1$, $C\\text{-}3$, $C\\text{-}5$, and equatorial at $C\\text{-}2$, $C\\text{-}4$. The claim that \"down\" should coincide with equatorial at *every* carbon is false. For example, in the most stable chair of $\\alpha$-$\\mathrm{D}$-glucopyranose, the anomeric hydroxyl at $C\\text{-}1$ is \"down\" and axial. The premise of minimizing $1,3$-diaxial interactions is a principle for determining conformational stability, not a rule for drawing a structure from a 2D projection. The proposed rule would construct an incorrect molecule.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nFinal selection includes options A, C, and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2608287"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply naming a sugar, we can predict its behavior in solution by analyzing its three-dimensional structure.

All necessary information for a unique solution is provided, and the premises are consistent with the fundamental principles of stereochemistry and chemical thermodynamics. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a full solution is provided below.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. The first part requires the identification and systematic naming of a sugar described by its Haworth projection. The second part requires the calculation of an equilibrium mole fraction based on a provided energetic model.\n\nPart 1: Identification and Naming of the Aldohexose\n\nThe problem describes a six-membered cyclic hemiacetal of an aldohexose, which is a pyranose ring. The structure is given by its features in a standard Haworth projection. We can deduce the identity of the sugar by translating these features into a Fischer projection.\n\n1.  D/L Configuration: The exocyclic $\\mathrm{CH_2OH}$ group at carbon $C5$ is specified to be \"above\" the mean plane of the ring. In a conventional Haworth projection of a pyranose, this orientation corresponds to a sugar of the D-series. The configuration at the highest-numbered stereocenter, $C5$, is therefore the same as in D-glyceraldehyde.\n\n2.  Anomeric Configuration: The anomeric hydroxyl group at carbon $C1$ is specified to be \"below\" the mean plane of the ring. For a D-sugar, a hydroxyl group \"down\" at the anomeric center ($C1$) defines the $\\alpha$ anomer. Therefore, the molecule described is an $\\alpha$-D-aldohexopyranose.\n\n3.  Stereochemistry at $C2$, $C3$, and $C4$: The problem provides the orientations of the hydroxyl groups at the other stereocenters. We use the standard convention for converting a Haworth projection to a Fischer projection for a D-aldohexopyranose: substituents that are \"down\" in the Haworth projection are on the \"right\" in the Fischer projection, and substituents that are \"up\" are on the \"left\".\n\n    *   The hydroxyl at $C2$ is \"below\" (down), which corresponds to the right side in the Fischer projection.\n    *   The hydroxyl at $C3$ is \"above\" (up), which corresponds to the left side in the Fischer projection.\n    *   The hydroxyl at $C4$ is \"below\" (down), which corresponds to the right side in the Fischer projection.\n\n4.  Constructing the Fischer Projection: We can now draw the open-chain Fischer projection for this aldohexose. The aldehyde group ($\\mathrm{CHO}$) is at the top ($C1$). The chain is numbered downwards to $C6$ ($\\mathrm{CH_2OH}$). As established, it is a D-sugar, so the hydroxyl at $C5$ is on the right.\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{array}{c}\n    \\mathrm{CHO} \\\\\n    | \\\\\n    \\mathrm{H} - \\underset{\\Large|}{\\mathrm{C}} - \\mathrm{OH} \\\\\n    | \\\\\n    \\mathrm{HO} - \\underset{\\Large|}{\\mathrm{C}} - \\mathrm{H} \\\\\n    | \\\\\n    \\mathrm{H} - \\underset{\\Large|}{\\mathrm{C}} - \\mathrm{OH} \\\\\n    | \\\\\n    \\mathrm{H} - \\underset{\\Large|}{\\mathrm{C}} - \\mathrm{OH} \\\\\n    | \\\\\n    \\mathrm{CH_2OH}\n    \\end{array}\n    \\quad\n    \\begin{array}{l}\n    \\leftarrow C1 \\\\\n    \\leftarrow C2\\text{ (OH on right)} \\\\\n    \\leftarrow C3\\text{ (OH on left)} \\\\\n    \\leftarrow C4\\text{ (OH on right)} \\\\\n    \\leftarrow C5\\text{ (D-series, OH on right)} \\\\\n    \\leftarrow C6\n    \\end{array}\n    $$\n    This stereochemical pattern (right, left, right, right for the hydroxyls from $C2$ to $C5$) is characteristic of the common aldohexose D-glucose.\n\n5.  Systematic Name: Combining all the deduced features—the anomeric descriptor ($\\alpha$), the series D/L descriptor (D), the root name of the sugar (glucose), and the ring size suffix (pyranose)—yields the full systematic name for the described molecule.\n    The name is $\\alpha$-D-glucopyranose.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the Equilibrium Mole Fraction\n\nWe are asked to find the equilibrium mole fraction of the $\\alpha$ anomer, $x_{\\alpha}$, in an aqueous solution where it is in equilibrium with its $\\beta$ anomer. The equilibrium is governed by the difference in their standard molar Gibbs energies, $\\Delta G^\\circ$, through the Boltzmann distribution.\n\nThe equilibrium reaction is the mutarotation of D-glucose:\n$$ \\alpha\\text{-D-glucopyranose} \\rightleftharpoons \\beta\\text{-D-glucopyranose} $$\n\nThe equilibrium constant, $K_{eq}$, for this reaction is given by the ratio of the mole fractions of the product to the reactant:\n$$ K_{eq} = \\frac{[\\beta]}{[\\alpha]} = \\frac{x_{\\beta}}{x_{\\alpha}} $$\nThermodynamically, the equilibrium constant is related to the standard Gibbs energy change of the reaction, $\\Delta G^\\circ = G_{\\beta}^{\\circ} - G_{\\alpha}^{\\circ}$, by the equation:\n$$ K_{eq} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\circ}{RT}\\right) $$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nTo find $\\Delta G^\\circ$, we must first determine the difference in energy between the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ anomers using the provided model. The problem states to consider the dominant ${}^{4}C_{1}$ chair conformation for both anomers and that all non-anomeric hydroxyls are in equatorial positions. This is consistent with the known structure of D-glucose, where the substituents at $C2, C3, C4$, and the $\\mathrm{CH_2OH}$ at $C5$ are all equatorial. The sole structural difference between the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ anomers in this conformation is the orientation of the anomeric hydroxyl at $C1$.\n\n*   In $\\beta$-D-glucopyranose, the anomeric hydroxyl at $C1$ is in an equatorial position. According to the model, an equatorial group has a relative energy contribution of $0$.\n*   In $\\alpha$-D-glucopyranose, the anomeric hydroxyl at $C1$ is in an axial position. The model specifies that an axial hydroxyl group contributes an energy penalty of $p = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. However, an axial *anomeric* hydroxyl gains a stabilization of $s = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n\nLet's define a reference energy $G_{ref}$ for the part of the molecule that is common to both anomers. The standard molar Gibbs energy of each anomer can be expressed as:\n$G_{\\beta}^{\\circ} = G_{ref}$ (anomeric OH is equatorial, no energy penalty or stabilization applies)\n$G_{\\alpha}^{\\circ} = G_{ref} + p - s$ (anomeric OH is axial, incurring a penalty $p$ and gaining stabilization $s$)\n\nThe standard Gibbs energy change for the reaction $\\alpha \\rightleftharpoons \\beta$ is:\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ = G_{\\beta}^{\\circ} - G_{\\alpha}^{\\circ} = G_{ref} - (G_{ref} + p - s) = -(p - s) = s - p $$\nSubstituting the given values, $p = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ and $s = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$:\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} - 3.0\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} = -1.8\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} $$\nWe must use consistent units for the calculation. Converting $\\Delta G^\\circ$ to $\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$:\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ = -1.8 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\nThe equilibrium constant is then:\n$$ K_{eq} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{-1.8 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}}{RT}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1.8 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}}{RT}\\right) $$\nAlternatively, we can express this as $K_{eq} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{p-s}{RT}\\right)$.\n\nAt equilibrium, the sum of mole fractions is $1$: $x_{\\alpha} + x_{\\beta} = 1$. We can express $x_{\\beta}$ as $1 - x_{\\alpha}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $K_{eq}$:\n$$ K_{eq} = \\frac{1 - x_{\\alpha}}{x_{\\alpha}} $$\nRearranging to solve for $x_{\\alpha}$:\n$$ K_{eq} \\, x_{\\alpha} = 1 - x_{\\alpha} $$\n$$ x_{\\alpha}(K_{eq} + 1) = 1 $$\n$$ x_{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{K_{eq} + 1} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $K_{eq}$:\n$$ x_{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{p-s}{RT}\\right) + 1} $$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided:\n$p - s = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} - 1.2\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} = 1.8\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} = 1800\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n$R = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\n$T = 298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nFirst, calculate the dimensionless exponent:\n$$ \\frac{p-s}{RT} = \\frac{1800\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}}{(8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})(298.15\\,\\mathrm{K})} = \\frac{1800}{2478.8211} \\approx 0.726153 $$\nNow, calculate $K_{eq}$:\n$$ K_{eq} = \\exp(0.726153) \\approx 2.06713 $$\nFinally, compute the mole fraction $x_{\\alpha}$:\n$$ x_{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{2.06713 + 1} = \\frac{1}{3.06713} \\approx 0.326038 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ x_{\\alpha} \\approx 0.3260 $$\nThe first part of the question asks for the name.

The mass fraction of a component $i$, $w_i = \\frac{m_i}{m_{\\text{total}}}$, is therefore equal to its mole fraction, $x_i = \\frac{n_i}{n_{\\text{total}}}$, because $m_i = n_i M$ and $m_{\\text{total}} = n_{\\text{total}} M$, leading to $w_i = \\frac{n_i M}{n_{\\text{total}} M} = x_i$.\n\nThus, the equation can be expressed in terms of mole fractions:\n$$\n\\left[\\alpha\\right]_{\\text{mix}} = x_{\\alpha}\\left[\\alpha\\right]_{\\alpha} + x_{\\beta}\\left[\\alpha\\right]_{\\beta}\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the open-chain form is negligible, so the solution consists only of the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ anomers. Their mole fractions must sum to unity:\n$$\nx_{\\alpha} + x_{\\beta} = 1\n$$\n\nSubstituting $x_{\\beta} = 1 - x_{\\alpha}$ into the mixture equation gives:\n$$\n\\left[\\alpha\\right]_{\\text{mix}} = x_{\\alpha}\\left[\\alpha\\right]_{\\alpha} + (1 - x_{\\alpha})\\left[\\alpha\\right]_{\\beta}\n$$\n$$\n\\left[\\alpha\\right]_{\\text{mix}} = x_{\\alpha}\\left[\\alpha\\right]_{\\alpha} + \\left[\\alpha\\right]_{\\beta} - x_{\\alpha}\\left[\\alpha\\right]_{\\beta}\n$$\n\nRearranging to solve for the mole fraction of the $\\alpha$ anomer, $x_{\\alpha}$:\n$$\n\\left[\\alpha\\right]_{\\text{mix}} - \\left[\\alpha\\right]_{\\beta} = x_{\\alpha}(\\left[\\alpha\\right]_{\\alpha} - \\left[\\alpha\\right]_{\\beta})\n$$\n$$\nx_{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\left[\\alpha\\right]_{\\text{mix}} - \\left[\\alpha\\right]_{\\beta}}{\\left[\\alpha\\right]_{\\alpha} - \\left[\\alpha\\right]_{\\beta}}\n$$\n\nThis general formula will be used to determine the composition at both the initial time ($t=0$) and at equilibrium.\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial mole fraction of the $\\alpha$ anomer, $x_{\\alpha,0}$. The givens are:\n$\\left[\\alpha\\right]_{0} = +92.00$\n$\\left[\\alpha\\right]_{\\alpha} = +114.0$\n$\\left[\\alpha\\right]_{\\beta} = +19.0$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\nx_{\\alpha,0} = \\frac{+92.00 - (+19.0)}{+114.0 - (+19.0)} = \\frac{73.00}{95.0} = 0.768421...\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures. Thus, the initial mole fraction of the $\\alpha$ anomer is $0.7684$.\n\nSecond, we determine the equilibrium anomeric mole ratio, $\\frac{x_{\\alpha,\\mathrm{eq}}}{x_{\\beta,\\mathrm{eq}}}$. We first find the equilibrium mole fraction of the $\\alpha$ anomer, $x_{\\alpha,\\mathrm{eq}}$, using the specific rotation at equilibrium, $\\left[\\alpha\\right]_{\\mathrm{eq}} = +52.70$.\n\n$$\nx_{\\alpha,\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{\\left[\\alpha\\right]_{\\mathrm{eq}} - \\left[\\alpha\\right]_{\\beta}}{\\left[\\alpha\\right]_{\\alpha} - \\left[\\alpha\\right]_{\\beta}} = \\frac{+52.70 - (+19.0)}{+114.0 - (+19.0)} = \\frac{33.70}{95.0} = 0.354736...\n$$\n\nThe equilibrium mole fraction of the $\\beta$ anomer, $x_{\\beta,\\mathrm{eq}}$, is then:\n$$\nx_{\\beta,\\mathrm{eq}} = 1 - x_{\\alpha,\\mathrm{eq}} = 1 - \\frac{33.70}{95.0} = \\frac{95.0 - 33.70}{95.0} = \\frac{61.30}{95.0}\n$$\n\nThe required equilibrium anomeric mole ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{x_{\\alpha,\\mathrm{eq}}}{x_{\\beta,\\mathrm{eq}}} = \\frac{\\frac{33.70}{95.0}}{\\frac{61.30}{95.0}} = \\frac{33.70}{61.30} = 0.549755...\n$$\n\nRounding this result to four significant figures as instructed gives $0.5498$.\n\nThe two requested values are the initial mole fraction of the $\\alpha$ anomer, $x_{\\alpha,0}$, and the equilibrium anomeric mole ratio, $\\frac{x_{\\alpha,\\mathrm{eq}}}{x_{\\beta,\\mathrm{eq}}}$. The results are $0.7684$ and $0.5498$, respectively.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.7684 & 0.5498 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2608261"}]}
