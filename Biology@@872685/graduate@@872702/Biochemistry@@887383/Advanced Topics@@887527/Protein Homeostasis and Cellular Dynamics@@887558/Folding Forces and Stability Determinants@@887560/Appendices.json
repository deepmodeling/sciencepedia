The process occurs at constant pressure.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between Gibbs free energy change, enthalpy change ($\\Delta H$), and entropy change ($\\Delta S$) at a given temperature $T$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta G(T) = \\Delta H(T) - T \\Delta S(T)\n$$\nIn the context of protein unfolding, this is written as:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{unf}}(T) = \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{unf}}(T) - T \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{unf}}(T)\n$$\nTo find the explicit dependence on $T$, we must relate $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{unf}}(T)$ and $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{unf}}(T)$ to their values at the reference temperature, $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$.
