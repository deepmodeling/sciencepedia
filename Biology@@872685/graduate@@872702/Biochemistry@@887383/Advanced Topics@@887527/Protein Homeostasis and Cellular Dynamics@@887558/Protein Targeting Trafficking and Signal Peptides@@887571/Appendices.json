Construct Q has a moderately hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal transmembrane helix with several polar residues and a longer upstream cytosolic region with fewer positive charges.\n\nThe biochemist performs in vitro translation in mammalian cytosolic extract followed by membrane insertion assays using either native endoplasmic reticulum microsomes or proteoliposomes reconstituted with defined components. Insertion is monitored by protease protection of the carboxyl-terminal epitope and resistance to alkaline carbonate extraction, taken together as evidence of bona fide integration of the transmembrane segment into the bilayer. The following manipulations are independently tested:\n\n- Immunodepletion of the adenosine triphosphatase Transmembrane Recognition Complex subunit TRC40 (also known as ASNA1), with add-back of purified TRC40 variants as indicated.\n- Addition of the non-hydrolyzable adenosine triphosphate analog adenylyl-imidodiphosphate.\n- Immunodepletion of Signal Recognition Particle (SRP).\n- Addition of cycloheximide to prevent elongation and maintain ribosome association versus puromycin to release nascent chains.\n- Use of proteoliposomes containing the Tryptophan Rich Basic protein receptor and Calcium Modulating Ligand (WRB/CAML) versus protein-free liposomes, and, in separate trials, proteoliposomes containing the Endoplasmic Reticulum Membrane Protein Complex (EMC).\n- Addition of a Sec61 translocon channel inhibitor.\n\nObserved qualitative outcomes are as follows:\n\n- For construct P, protease-protected, carbonate-resistant insertion occurs with native microsomes and with WRB/CAML proteoliposomes, but not with protein-free liposomes. Insertion of P is lost upon TRC40 immunodepletion and is restored by wild-type TRC40 but not by a TRC40 variant defective in adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis. Adenylyl-imidodiphosphate blocks insertion of P. Depletion of SRP has no effect on P insertion. Cycloheximide versus puromycin does not alter P insertion efficiency. The Sec61 inhibitor does not alter P insertion.\n- For construct Q, insertion is only weakly affected by TRC40 immunodepletion and is not restored by TRC40 add-back. Q fails to insert into protein-free liposomes and into WRB/CAML proteoliposomes but inserts into proteoliposomes containing EMC.

Construct P is a canonical substrate of the Guided Entry of Tail-anchored proteins pathway, in mammals the Transmembrane Recognition Complex pathway: its carboxyl-terminal transmembrane helix is bound by adenosine triphosphate–loaded TRC40 and delivered post-translationally to the WRB/CAML receptor, where adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis promotes release and bilayer insertion independently of the Sec61 channel and ribosome association. Construct Q, having a less hydrophobic transmembrane helix, is inserted by the Endoplasmic Reticulum Membrane Protein Complex, largely independent of TRC40 and adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis.\n\nB. Constructs P and Q are primarily co-translationally targeted by Signal Recognition Particle to the Sec61 channel; the blockade of P insertion by adenylyl-imidodiphosphate indicates a requirement for Signal Recognition Particle’s guanosine triphosphatase cycle, whereas Q bypasses this requirement due to lower hydrophobicity.\n\nC. Construct P inserts spontaneously into lipid bilayers driven solely by hydrophobic partitioning; the observed dependence on TRC40 and adenosine triphosphate reflects indirect effects on bilayer fluidity. Construct Q requires the Sec61 channel because its transmembrane helix is insufficiently hydrophobic to partition spontaneously.\n\nD.
