It is a straightforward exercise in applying the principle of mass balance at steady state. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the system at steady state is that the rate of production of the species of interest must equal its rate of removal. Let $N$ represent the steady-state abundance of mature, RISC-loaded miRNA molecules per cell.\n\nThe overall rate of production of mature miRNA, denoted as $R_{\\mathrm{prod}}$, is determined by the initial transcription rate, $r_{t}$, attenuated by the successive efficiencies of each step in the biogenesis pathway. Since the steps are independent and multiplicative, the effective production rate is the product of the transcription rate and all efficiency fractions.\n\nThe rate of pri-miRNA transcription is $r_{t}$.\nThe rate of successful processing by the Microprocessor complex is $r_{t} e_{M}$.\nThe rate of successful cleavage by Dicer is $(r_{t} e_{M}) e_{D}$.\nThe final rate of formation of mature, RISC-loaded miRNA is this quantity multiplied by the RISC loading fraction, $f_{R}$.\nTherefore, the rate of production is given by the expression:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{prod}} = r_{t} e_{M} e_{D} f_{R}$$\n\nThe problem states that the removal of mature miRNA is a first-order process with a rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$. The rate of removal, $R_{\\mathrm{rem}}$, is therefore directly proportional to the number of molecules present, $N$.\n$$R_{\\mathrm{rem}} = k_{\\mathrm{deg}} N$$\n\nAt steady state, the number of molecules $N$ is constant, which requires that the production rate equals the removal rate.\n$$R_{\\mathrm{prod}} = R_{\\mathrm{rem}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the rates gives the following equation:\n$$r_{t} e_{M} e_{D} f_{R} = k_{\\mathrm{deg}} N$$\n\nTo find the steady-state abundance $N$, we solve this algebraic equation for $N$:\n$$N = \\frac{r_{t} e_{M} e_{D} f_{R}}{k_{\\mathrm{deg}}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression. The units of $r_{t}$ are molecules/minute and the units of $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$ are $1$/minute. The efficiencies $e_{M}$, $e_{D}$, and $f_{R}$ are dimensionless. The resulting unit for $N$ will be molecules, which is correct.\n$$N = \\frac{180 \\times 0.65 \\times 0.90 \\times 0.50}{0.0035}$$\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator, which represents the effective flux into the mature miRNA pool in molecules per minute:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{prod}} = 180 \\times 0.65 \\times 0.90 \\times 0.50 = 52.65 \\text{ molecules/minute}$$\n\nNext, divide this production rate by the degradation rate constant:\n$$N = \\frac{52.65}{0.0035} = 15042.85714...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

It presents a standard enzyme kinetics problem applied to the biologically relevant system of RNA interference. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions. Therefore, a rigorous solution can be constructed.\n\nThe problem asks for three tasks: a justification of the single-turnover kinetics, a derivation of the turnover number $k_{\\text{cat}}$, and its numerical calculation.\n\nFirst, we address the single-turnover experiment and the identity of the measured rate constant. The kinetic scheme is $E + S \\xrightleftharpoons[k_{\\text{off}}]{k_{\\text{on}}} ES \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{c}}} EP \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{rel}}} E + P$.\nThe single-turnover experiment is conducted under the condition $[E]_0 \\gg [S]_0$, where $[E]_0 = 100\\ \\mathrm{nM}$ and $[S]_0 = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{nM}$. Under this condition, the concentration of free enzyme, $[E]$, remains approximately constant and equal to the initial total concentration, $[E]_0$. The bimolecular association step $E + S \\to ES$ can therefore be treated as a pseudo-first-order reaction with an effective rate constant $k'_{\\text{on}} = k_{\\text{on}}[E]_0$.\nGiven $k_{\\text{on}} = 5.0 \\times 10^7\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$ and $[E]_0 = 100\\ \\mathrm{nM} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{M}$:\n$$k'_{\\text{on}} = (5.0 \\times 10^7\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{M}) = 5.0\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\nWe must also consider the reverse dissociation step, with rate constant $k_{\\text{off}}$. Using the provided relationship $K_D = k_{\\text{off}}/k_{\\text{on}}$, we find $k_{\\text{off}}$ from $K_D = 2.0\\ \\mathrm{nM} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{M}$:\n$$k_{\\text{off}} = K_D \\times k_{\\text{on}} = (2.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{M}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^7\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}) = 0.10\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\nThe problem states that the fraction of cleaved substrate, $f(t)$, fits a single exponential with unit amplitude. This implies that once a substrate molecule binds, it is committed to the cleavage pathway, and the back-dissociation is negligible. This is justified because the rate of rebinding of any dissociated substrate to the large excess of free enzyme ($k'_{\\text{on}} = 5.0\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$) is much greater than the rate of dissociation ($k_{\\text{off}} = 0.10\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$). The ratio $k'_{\\text{on}}/k_{\\text{off}} = 50$ demonstrates that substrate is effectively trapped, ensuring that all initial substrate proceeds to product, which explains the unit amplitude.\nWith binding being effectively irreversible, the substrate follows the sequential pathway $S \\xrightarrow{k'_{\\text{on}}} ES \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{c}}} \\text{cleaved products}$. The time evolution of the fraction of cleaved substrate, $f(t)$, for such a two-step sequence is generally a bi-exponential function of the form $f(t) = 1 - A\\exp(-k'_{\\text{on}}t) - B\\exp(-k_c t)$. This simplifies to a single exponential, $f(t) \\approx 1 - \\exp(-k_{\\text{obs}}t)$, if one step is significantly slower than the other, i.e., rate-limiting.\nWe determine the observed rate constant, $k_{\\text{obs}}$, from the experimental data. The function is $f(t) = 1 - \\exp(-k_{\\text{obs}}t)$.\nFrom the data point $f(5.0\\ \\mathrm{s}) = 0.632$:\n$$0.632 = 1 - \\exp(-k_{\\text{obs}} \\times 5.0)$$\n$$\\exp(-5.0 k_{\\text{obs}}) = 0.368$$\n$$-5.0 k_{\\text{obs}} = \\ln(0.368) \\approx -0.9996$$\n$$k_{\\text{obs}} \\approx 0.200\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\nThis is consistent with the second data point $f(10.0\\ \\mathrm{s}) = 0.865$, since $1 - \\exp(-0.200 \\times 10.0) = 1 - \\exp(-2) \\approx 1 - 0.1353 = 0.8647$.\nWe now compare the calculated pseudo-first-order binding rate, $k'_{\\text{on}} = 5.0\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, with the observed rate of cleavage, $k_{\\text{obs}} = 0.200\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. Since $k'_{\\text{on}} \\gg k_{\\text{obs}}$, the binding step is much faster than the overall process. This signifies that the chemical step, $ES \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{c}}} EP$, is the rate-limiting step in this sequence. Therefore, the observed rate constant $k_{\\text{obs}}$ is a direct measure of the microscopic chemical cleavage rate constant, $k_{\\text{c}}$.\n$$k_{\\text{c}} = k_{\\text{obs}} = 0.200\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\n\nSecond, we derive the expression for the steady-state turnover number, $k_{\\text{cat}}$. By definition, $k_{\\text{cat}}$ is the maximum rate of catalysis per enzyme molecule under saturating substrate concentration ($[S] \\to \\infty$). At substrate saturation, any free enzyme $E$ immediately binds a new substrate molecule $S$ to form $ES$. Thus, the binding step is not rate-limiting, and the enzyme population is predominantly distributed between the $ES$ and $EP$ states. One full catalytic cycle consists of the sequential unimolecular steps an enzyme takes after binding substrate: $ES \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{c}}} EP \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{rel}}} E$. The regenerated $E$ instantly starts a new cycle.\nThe total time required for one cycle, $\\tau_{\\text{cycle}}$, is the sum of the average lifetimes of the intermediates $ES$ and $EP$. For a first-order process with rate constant $k$, the mean lifetime of the state is $\\tau = 1/k$. Therefore, the mean time spent in the $ES$ state before cleavage is $\\tau_{ES} = 1/k_c$, and the mean time spent in the $EP$ state before product release is $\\tau_{EP} = 1/k_{\\text{rel}}$.\nThe mean total cycle time is the sum of the mean times of these sequential, obligatory steps:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{cycle}} = \\tau_{ES} + \\tau_{EP} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{c}}} + \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{rel}}}$$\nThe turnover number, $k_{\\text{cat}}$, is the number of cycles per unit time, which is the reciprocal of the mean cycle time:\n$$k_{\\text{cat}} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\text{cycle}}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{k_{\\text{c}}} + \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{rel}}}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{c}} k_{\\text{rel}}}{k_{\\text{c}} + k_{\\text{rel}}}$$\n\nThird, we compute the numerical value of $k_{\\text{cat}}$ using the experimental values. From the single-turnover analysis, we have $k_{\\text{c}} = 0.200\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. The problem provides the product release rate from a separate experiment: $k_{\\text{rel}} = 5.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\nSubstituting these values into our derived expression for $k_{\\text{cat}}$:\n$$k_{\\text{cat}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{0.200\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}} + \\frac{1}{5.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}}}$$\nThe individual reciprocal times are:\n$$\\frac{1}{0.200\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}} = 5.00\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{5.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}} = 20.0\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\nThe total mean cycle time is $\\tau_{\\text{cycle}} = 5.00\\ \\mathrm{s} + 20.0\\ \\mathrm{s} = 25.0\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\nTherefore, the turnover number is:\n$$k_{\\text{cat}} = \\frac{1}{25.0\\ \\mathrm{s}} = 0.0400\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\nExpressed in scientific notation and rounded to three significant figures, as required:\n$$k_{\\text{cat}} = 4.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\nThis result indicates that under saturating substrate conditions, a single RISC enzyme complex can cleave one target mRNA molecule every $25$ seconds on average, with product release being the dominant rate-limiting step in the cycle ($20\\ \\mathrm{s}$ of the cycle time) compared to the chemical cleavage step ($5\\ \\mathrm{s}$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.00 \\times 10^{-2}}$$", "id": "2604033"}, {"introduction": "The cellular environment is a crowded space where molecules compete for limited resources.
