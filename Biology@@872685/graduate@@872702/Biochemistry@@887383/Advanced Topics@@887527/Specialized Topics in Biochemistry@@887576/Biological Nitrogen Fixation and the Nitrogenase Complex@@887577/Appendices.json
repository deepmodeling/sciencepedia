The equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d[\\mathrm{C}]}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}[\\mathrm{Fe}]_0[\\mathrm{MoFe}]_{\\mathrm{total}} - (k_{\\mathrm{on}}[\\mathrm{Fe}]_0 + k_{\\mathrm{off}})[\\mathrm{C}] $$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. The system relaxes to its equilibrium state with an observed rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, which is the coefficient of the concentration term $[\\mathrm{C}]$. Thus, the relationship between the observed rate constant and the total concentration of Fe protein is:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{obs}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}[\\mathrm{Fe}]_0 + k_{\\mathrm{off}} $$\nThis equation is of the linear form $y = mx + c$, where $y = k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, $x = [\\mathrm{Fe}]_0$, the slope $m = k_{\\mathrm{on}}$, and the y-intercept $c = k_{\\mathrm{off}}$.

Thus, the problem is not unrealistic or based on flawed premises.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the ATP Cost per Mole of Ammonia**\n\nLet us analyze the stoichiometry of electron and ATP consumption. The nitrogenase complex partitions the total electron flux into two reactions: the reduction of dinitrogen and the reduction of protons.\n\nThe reduction of one mole of dinitrogen to two moles of ammonia is given by:\n$$N_2 + 6e^{-} + 6H^{+} \\rightarrow 2\\text{NH}_3$$\nThis reaction consumes $n_{e^{-},N_2} = 6$ moles of electrons per mole of $N_2$ reduced.\n\nThe reduction of protons to dihydrogen is given by:\n$$2H^{+} + 2e^{-} \\rightarrow H_2$$\nThis reaction consumes $n_{e^{-},H_2} = 2$ moles of electrons per mole of $H_2$ produced.\n\nThe problem states that for every $1$ mole of $N_2$ that is reduced, $r$ moles of $H_2$ are evolved. Therefore, we can establish a basis of calculation for the reduction of $1$ mole of $N_2$.\n\nThe total number of moles of electrons, $n_{e^{-},\\text{total}}$, consumed per mole of $N_2$ reduced is the sum of electrons used for both processes:\n$$n_{e^{-},\\text{total}} = n_{e^{-},N_2} + r \\cdot n_{e^{-},H_2}$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$n_{e^{-},\\text{total}} = 6 + r \\cdot 2 = 6 + 2r$$\n\nThe problem specifies that the hydrolysis of $k_{\\text{ATP}/e^{-}} = 2$ molecules of ATP is required for every single electron transferred through the complex. Therefore, the total number of moles of ATP hydrolyzed per mole of $N_2$ reduced, $N_{\\text{ATP}}$, is:\n$$N_{\\text{ATP}} = n_{e^{-},\\text{total}} \\times k_{\\text{ATP}/e^{-}}$$\n$$N_{\\text{ATP}} = (6 + 2r) \\times 2 = 12 + 4r$$\n\nThis quantity, $N_{\\text{ATP}}$, represents the total ATP cost for reducing $1$ mole of $N_2$ and concurrently producing $r$ moles of $H_2$. The reduction of $1$ mole of $N_2$ yields $2$ moles of $\\text{NH}_3$. The question asks for the ATP cost per mole of ammonia, which we denote as $C_{\\text{ATP}/\\text{NH}_3}(r)$. This is found by dividing the total ATP cost by the moles of ammonia produced:\n$$C_{\\text{ATP}/\\text{NH}_3}(r) = \\frac{N_{\\text{ATP}}}{2} = \\frac{12 + 4r}{2}$$\n$$C_{\\text{ATP}/\\text{NH}_3}(r) = 6 + 2r$$\nThis is the required symbolic expression for the ATP cost per mole of ammonia as a function of the ratio $r$.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate this expression for $r = 2.3$.\n$$C_{\\text{ATP}/\\text{NH}_3}(2.3) = 6 + 2(2.3) = 6 + 4.6 = 10.6$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, the value is $10.60$. The units are moles of ATP per mole of $\\text{NH}_3$.\n\n**Justification for the Thermodynamic Trade-off**\n\nThe minimal reaction stoichiometry for nitrogenase is often considered to be $N_2 + 8H^+ + 8e^- \\to 2\\text{NH}_3 + H_2$. This corresponds to a baseline evolution of one mole of $H_2$ for every mole of $N_2$ reduced, meaning $r=1$. This is viewed as an obligatory part of the catalytic cycle. A deviation where $r > 1$ signifies that a larger fraction of electrons is being diverted to proton reduction at the expense of dinitrogen reduction.\n\nThis phenomenon reflects a critical thermodynamic trade-off. The reduction of dinitrogen ($N \\equiv N$) is an exceptionally challenging chemical transformation due to the immense strength of the triple bond. To overcome this large activation energy barrier, the MoFe protein active site must be maintained in a highly reduced, and thus thermodynamically potent, state. This state is achieved through a series of ATP-dependent electron transfers from the Fe protein.\n\nHowever, this highly energetic reduced state is not perfectly selective for $N_2$. It is also capable of reducing protons ($H^+$), which are abundantly available in the aqueous environment. The reduction of protons to $H_2$ ($E^{\\circ'} \\approx -0.42 \\, \\text{V}$ at pH $7$) is thermodynamically more favorable than the initial electron transfers required to activate $N_2$.\n\nConsequently, if the rate of electron delivery to the MoFe protein exceeds the rate at which it can bind and reduce $N_2$ (which might be limited by $N_2$ concentration or other factors), the excess reducing equivalents are \"leaked\" to the most accessible substrate, which is $H^+$. This results in $H_2$ evolution where $r>1$. The \"trade-off\" is thus between maintaining a high electron flux and a highly reduced catalytic site (kinetic readiness) versus maximizing the energetic efficiency of substrate conversion (minimal ATP cost per $\\text{NH}_3$). Spending energy via ATP hydrolysis to pump electrons into the MoFe protein ensures the enzyme is always \"primed\" for the difficult $N_2$ reduction, but this high-energy state inevitably leads to some energy dissipation through the futile cycle of proton reduction, lowering overall efficiency. A higher value of $r$ indicates a greater degree of this uncoupling between electron flow and productive ammonia synthesis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10.60}$$", "id": "2546469"}]}
