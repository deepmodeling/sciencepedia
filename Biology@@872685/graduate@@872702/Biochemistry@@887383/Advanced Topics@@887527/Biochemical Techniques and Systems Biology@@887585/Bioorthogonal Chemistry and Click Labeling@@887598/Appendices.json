It is therefore valid for solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds from the first principles of first-order chemical kinetics. Let $C(t)$ represent the fraction of intact oxime bonds at a given time $t$. The initial condition is given as $C(0) = 1$. The rate of hydrolysis is proportional to the amount of intact oxime present.

Therefore, the fraction of intact oxime bonds at time $t$, denoted $F_{\\text{intact}}(t)$, is:\n$$\nF_{\\text{intact}}(t) = \\exp(-k_{\\text{hyd}} t)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the fraction of oxime bonds that have been hydrolyzed, which we will denote as $F_{\\text{hyd}}(t)$.

In typical in vitro imaging experiments, especially those involving live cells, experiments may last from several hours up to $24$ hours or more. A critical requirement for a bioorthogonal linkage is its stability under physiological conditions throughout the duration of the experiment. Significant cleavage of the linkage would lead to a loss of the reporter fluorophore from the target biomolecule, resulting in a decreasing signal and potentially confounding the interpretation of the results. A loss of only $2.73\\%$ of the conjugate over a $24$-hour period means that over $97\\%$ of the label remains attached. This degree of stability is generally considered very high and acceptable for most standard imaging applications. The signal decay due to hydrolysis would be minimal and unlikely to compromise the validity of the experimental observations.
