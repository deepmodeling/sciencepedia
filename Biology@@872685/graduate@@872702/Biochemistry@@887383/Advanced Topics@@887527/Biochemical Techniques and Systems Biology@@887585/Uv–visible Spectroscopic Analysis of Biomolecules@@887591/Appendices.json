The attenuation of light intensity $I$ through an absorbing medium is described by a differential equation. Consider a beam of monochromatic light passing through a cuvette. The change in intensity, $dI$, over an infinitesimal path length $dx$ is proportional to the intensity $I(x)$ at that position and to the number density of the absorbing chromophores, $N$ (molecules per unit volume).\n$$dI = - \\sigma N I(x) dx$$\nHere, $\\sigma$ is the molecular absorption cross-section, a proportionality constant with units of area per molecule (e.g., $\\mathrm{cm^2}$). The negative sign indicates that intensity decreases with distance. The number density $N$ must be related to the molar concentration $c$, which is given in units of $\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$. To ensure dimensional consistency, we must convert units. Given that $1 \\ \\mathrm{L} = 1000 \\ \\mathrm{cm^3}$, the concentration in $\\mathrm{mol\\,cm^{-3}}$ is $\\frac{c}{1000}$. The number density $N$ in molecules per $\\mathrm{cm^3}$ is then this value multiplied by Avogadro's number, $N_A$:\n$$N \\left[\\frac{\\mathrm{molecules}}{\\mathrm{cm^3}}\\right] = c \\left[\\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\mathrm{L}}\\right] \\times \\frac{1 \\ \\mathrm{L}}{1000 \\ \\mathrm{cm^3}} \\times N_A \\left[\\frac{\\mathrm{molecules}}{\\mathrm{mol}}\\right] = \\frac{c N_A}{1000}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $N$ into the differential equation yields:\n$$\\frac{dI}{I} = - \\sigma \\left(\\frac{c N_A}{1000}\\right) dx$$\nTo find the total attenuation across the entire path length of the cuvette, $l$, we integrate this equation from $x=0$ (where intensity is $I_0$) to $x=l$ (where intensity is $I$). The concentration $c$ is assumed to be spatially uniform.\n$$\\int_{I_0}^{I} \\frac{dI'}{I'} = - \\int_{0}^{l} \\frac{\\sigma c N_A}{1000} dx'$$\nExecution of the integration gives:\n$$\\ln(I) - \\ln(I_0) = - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma c N_A}{1000}\\right) l$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{I}{I_0}\\right) = - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma c N_A}{1000}\\right) l$$\nThis exponential attenuation model must be related to the definition of decadic absorbance, $A$:\n$$A \\equiv -\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I}{I_0}\\right)$$\nUsing the logarithmic identity $\\log_{10}(x) = \\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\ln(10)}$, we can write:\n$$A = -\\frac{\\ln(I/I_0)}{\\ln(10)} = -\\frac{1}{\\ln(10)} \\left[ - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma c N_A}{1000}\\right) l \\right]$$\n$$A = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma N_A}{1000 \\ln(10)}\\right) c l$$\nThis result demonstrates the linear relationship between absorbance $A$ and concentration $c$. The term in parentheses is defined as the molar decadic extinction coefficient, $\\varepsilon$:\n$$\\varepsilon \\equiv \\frac{\\sigma N_A}{1000 \\ln(10)}$$\nThis allows the linear relation to be written in its compact and conventional form, the Beer-Lambert law:\n$$A = \\varepsilon c l$$\nHaving derived this relation, we now proceed to calculate the concentration $c$ by rearranging the formula and substituting the provided values.\n$$c = \\frac{A}{\\varepsilon l}$$\nThe given parameters are:\n-   Absorbance $A = 0.75$ (dimensionless)\n-   Molar decadic extinction coefficient $\\varepsilon = 15{,}000 \\ \\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}\\,cm^{-1}}$\n-   Path length $l = 0.5 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$$c = \\frac{0.75}{(15000 \\ \\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}\\,cm^{-1}}) \\times (0.5 \\ \\mathrm{cm})}$$\nThe product in the denominator is:\n$$\\varepsilon l = (1.5 \\times 10^4 \\ \\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}\\,cm^{-1}}) \\times (0.5 \\ \\mathrm{cm}) = 7500 \\ \\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}} = 7.5 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}}$$\nThe concentration is therefore:\n$$c = \\frac{0.75}{7.5 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}}} = \\frac{7.5 \\times 10^{-1}}{7.5 \\times 10^3} \\ \\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$$\nThe problem statement requires the answer to be expressed with two significant figures. The calculated value $1.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ is already in this form.\n\nFinally, a comment on significant figures and units is required.\nThe precision of the final answer is constrained by the precision of the input data. The absorbance $A=0.75$ possesses two significant figures. The path length $l=0.5 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$, as written, has only one significant figure, and the extinction coefficient $\\varepsilon=15{,}000 \\ \\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}\\,cm^{-1}}$ has an ambiguous number of significant figures. Strict application of propagation of uncertainty rules would limit the result to one significant figure from $l$. However, we are explicitly instructed to round to two significant figures. This instruction supersedes the standard rule and implies that the input quantities, especially $l$ and $\\varepsilon$, are to be treated as having at least two significant figures (i.e., $l=0.50 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$ and $\\varepsilon=1.5 \\times 10^4 \\ \\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}\\,cm^{-1}}$). With this understanding, the precision is limited by the absorbance measurement, $A=0.75$, and the result is correctly given with two significant figures.\n\nThe dimensional consistency is a critical aspect of the calculation. The units assigned to the molar extinction coefficient, $\\varepsilon$, are specifically chosen for practical convenience in chemical analysis. The relationship is $c = A / (\\varepsilon l)$. Since absorbance $A$ is a dimensionless quantity, the units of concentration $c$ are the reciprocal of the units of the product $\\varepsilon l$:\n$$\\text{Units of } c = \\frac{1}{\\text{Units of } \\varepsilon \\times \\text{Units of } l} = \\frac{1}{(\\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}\\,cm^{-1}}) \\times (\\mathrm{cm})} = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}}} = \\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$$\nThus, the use of $\\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}\\,cm^{-1}}$ for $\\varepsilon$ and $\\mathrm{cm}$ for $l$ directly yields a concentration in $\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$ (molarity), which is the standard unit for concentration in chemistry, without requiring any intermediate unit conversions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.0 \\times 10^{-4}}\n$$", "id": "2615517"}, {"introduction": "While the Beer-Lambert law describes an ideal linear relationship, real instruments have limitations.
