It describes the target-decoy approach for False Discovery Rate (FDR) estimation, a fundamental and widely accepted method in mass spectrometry-based proteomics. The provided data and definitions are sufficient to proceed, although two points require clarification based on standard practice in the field.\n\nFirst, the definition of the estimated FDR. The problem states it is \"obtained from the relative frequencies of decoy and target identifications\". Given that the target and decoy databases are of equal size, the number of false positive identifications in the target set at a given score threshold $\\tau$, denoted $FP(\\tau)$, is estimated by the number of decoy identifications, $D(\\tau)$. The FDR is the ratio of these estimated false positives to the total number of accepted target identifications, $T(\\tau)$. Therefore, the FDR estimator is:\n$$ \\text{FDR}(\\tau) = \\frac{D(\\tau)}{T(\\tau)} $$\nWe must consider cases where $T(\\tau) = 0$. In such a scenario, if $D(\\tau) > 0$, the FDR would be infinite; if $D(\\tau) = 0$, the FDR is defined as $0$. For the given dataset, this edge case does not present a problem for the relevant score thresholds.\n\nSecond, the definition of the q-value. For a PSM with a given score $s$, its q-value is the minimum estimated FDR at any score threshold $\\tau \\le s$. This is a correction to ensure that the q-values are monotonically non-decreasing as the score decreases. If the PSMs are sorted by score in descending order, $s_1 \\ge s_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge s_N$, the q-value for the $k$-th PSM, $q_k$, is calculated as:\n$$ q_k = \\min_{j \\ge k} \\{ \\text{FDR}(s_j) \\} $$\nThis means we must calculate the FDR for all score thresholds and then compute a running minimum from the lowest score upwards.\n\nWith these formulations, we can address the tasks.\n\nTask 1: Compute the q-value for each PSM.\n\nWe first sort all $24$ PSMs by score in descending order, as they are presented in the problem. We then iterate through the sorted list, calculating the cumulative number of target hits, $T_{cum}(i)$, the cumulative number of decoy hits, $D_{cum}(i)$, and the corresponding FDR for the set of PSMs with scores greater than or equal to the score of the $i$-th PSM, $s_i$. Finally, we compute the q-values. The results are tabulated below. Note that $\\text{FDR}_i = \\text{FDR}(s_i) = D_{cum}(i) / T_{cum}(i)$.\n\n| Index ($i$) | ID   | Type   | Score ($s_i$) | $D_{cum}(i)$ | $T_{cum}(i)$ | $\\text{FDR}_i$        | $q_i$                 |\n| ----------- | ---- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ | --------------------- | --------------------- |\n| $1$         | A1   | target | $98.7$        | $0$          | $1$          | $0/1 = 0.0$           | $0.0$                 |\n| $2$         | A2   | target | $97.8$        | $0$          | $2$          | $0/2 = 0.0$           | $0.0$                 |\n| $3$         | A3   | target | $96.5$        | $0$          | $3$          | $0/3 = 0.0$           | $0.0$                 |\n| $4$         | A4   | target | $95.2$        | $0$          | $4$          | $0/4 = 0.0$           | $0.0$                 |\n| $5$         | A5   | target | $94.9$        | $0$          | $5$          | $0/5 = 0.0$           | $0.0$                 |\n| $6$         | A6   | target | $93.7$        | $0$          | $6$          | $0/6 = 0.0$           | $0.0$                 |\n| $7$         | A7   | target | $92.3$        | $0$          | $7$          | $0/7 = 0.0$           | $0.0$                 |\n| $8$         | A8   | target | $91.8$        | $0$          | $8$          | $0/8 = 0.0$           | $0.0$                 |\n| $9$         | A9   | target | $90.5$        | $0$          | $9$          | $0/9 = 0.0$           | $0.0$                 |\n| $10$        | A10  | target | $89.4$        | $0$          | $10$         | $0/10 = 0.0$          | $0.0$                 |\n| $11$        | A11  | decoy  | $88.3$        | $1$          | $10$         | $1/10 = 0.1$          | $1/11 \\approx 0.0909$ |\n| $12$        | A12  | target | $87.9$        | $1$          | $11$         | $1/11 \\approx 0.0909$ | $1/11 \\approx 0.0909$ |\n| $13$        | A13  | decoy  | $87.1$        | $2$          | $11$         | $2/11 \\approx 0.1818$ | $2/13 \\approx 0.1538$ |\n| $14$        | A14  | target | $86.5$        | $2$          | $12$         | $2/12 \\approx 0.1667$ | $2/13 \\approx 0.1538$ |\n| $15$        | A15  | target | $85.2$        | $2$          | $13$         | $2/13 \\approx 0.1538$ | $2/13 \\approx 0.1538$ |\n| $16$        | A16  | decoy  | $84.9$        | $3$          | $13$         | $3/13 \\approx 0.2308$ | $3/15 = 0.2$          |\n| $17$        | A17  | target | $84.2$        | $3$          | $14$         | $3/14 \\approx 0.2143$ | $3/15 = 0.2$          |\n| $18$        | A18  | target | $83.6$        | $3$          | $15$         | $3/15 = 0.2$          | $3/15 = 0.2$          |\n| $19$        | A19  | decoy  | $82.8$        | $4$          | $15$         | $4/15 \\approx 0.2667$ | $4/17 \\approx 0.2353$ |\n| $20$        | A20  | target | $82.1$        | $4$          | $16$         | $4/16 = 0.25$         | $4/17 \\approx 0.2353$ |\n| $21$        | A21  | target | $81.5$        | $4$          | $17$         | $4/17 \\approx 0.2353$ | $4/17 \\approx 0.2353$ |\n| $22$        | A22  | decoy  | $80.7$        | $5$          | $17$         | $5/17 \\approx 0.2941$ | $5/18 \\approx 0.2778$ |\n| $23$        | A23  | target | $80.2$        | $5$          | $18$         | $5/18 \\approx 0.2778$ | $5/18 \\approx 0.2778$ |\n| $24$        | A24  | decoy  | $79.6$        | $6$          | $18$         | $6/18 \\approx 0.3333$ | $6/18 \\approx 0.3333$ |\n\nThe calculated q-values for all PSMs are shown in the final column. This completes the first task.\n\nTask 2: Determine the minimal score threshold $\\tau_{0.010}$.\n\nWe are asked for the minimal score threshold $\\tau_{0.010}$ such that accepting all PSMs with score $\\ge \\tau_{0.010}$ results in an estimated FDR less than or equal to $0.010$. That is, we must find $\\tau_{0.010}$ such that $\\text{FDR}(\\tau_{0.010}) \\le 0.010$.\n\nThe phrasing \"minimal score threshold\" is terminologically imprecise. The function $\\text{FDR}(\\tau)$ is a step function that is constant between observed scores. The set of all real-valued thresholds $\\tau$ that satisfy the condition $\\text{FDR}(\\tau) \\le 0.010$ is the interval $(\\$88.3, \\infty)$. This set is open on the left and thus does not contain a minimum element. However, in the context of this scientific field, such a question refers to a conventional procedure: one determines the largest set of top-scoring PSMs that satisfy the FDR criterion, and the threshold is taken as the score of the lowest-scoring PSM in that set.\n\nWe inspect the $\\text{FDR}_i$ column in the table.\nFor $i = 1$ to $10$, $\\text{FDR}_i = 0$, which satisfies $\\text{FDR}_i \\le 0.010$.\nThe list of PSMs from A1 to A10 (with scores from $98.7$ down to $89.4$) has an FDR of $0$.\nFor $i = 11$, the score is $s_{11} = 88.3$. The set of PSMs with score $\\ge 88.3$ includes the first decoy A11. The FDR becomes $\\text{FDR}_{11} = D(88.3) / T(88.3) = 1/10 = 0.1$.\nSince $0.1 > 0.010$, this set of PSMs is not acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the largest set of accepted PSMs satisfying the FDR constraint is the set $\\{A1, A2, \\dots, A10\\}$. Following convention, the score threshold is the score of the lowest-scoring PSM in this accepted set. This is the score of PSM A10.\n$$ \\tau_{0.010} = s_{10} = 89.4 $$\nThis value must be reported rounded to three significant figures. The value $89.4$ already has three significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{89.4}$$", "id": "2593660"}]}
