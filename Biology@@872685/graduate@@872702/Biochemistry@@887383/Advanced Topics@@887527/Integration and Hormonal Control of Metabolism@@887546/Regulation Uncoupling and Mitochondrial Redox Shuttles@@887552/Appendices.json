Under these steady-state, nonphosphorylating conditions, oxygen consumption equals the electron transport required to pump protons that exactly balance the proton leak across the inner membrane.

All necessary data and constants are provided. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the estimation of the UCP$1$-mediated proton conductance. Conductance, which we denote as $G$, is a measure of how easily electric current flows through a material for a given voltage. By analogy, for ion flow across a biological membrane, it is the ratio of the ion current ($I$) to the driving electrochemical potential. In this specific case, the proton current via UCP$1$ ($I_{H^+}$) is driven by the membrane potential ($\\Delta\\psi$), as the pH gradient is stated to be negligible. The fundamental relationship is:\n\n$$G_{H^+} = \\frac{I_{H^+}}{\\Delta \\psi}$$\n\nOur task is to calculate the terms on the right-hand side from the provided experimental data.\n\nFirst, we determine the portion of oxygen consumption that is specifically coupled to the UCP$1$-mediated proton leak. This is the GDP-sensitive component. The total rate of oxygen consumption with UCP$1$ activated by palmitate is given as $J_{\\mathrm{O_2, total}} = 32 \\text{ pmol O}_2 \\text{ s}^{-1} \\text{ mg}^{-1}$. The basal rate, measured after UCP$1$ is inhibited by GDP, is $J_{\\mathrm{O_2, basal}} = 14 \\text{ pmol O}_2 \\text{ s}^{-1} \\text{ mg}^{-1}$. The difference represents the oxygen consumption rate that fuels the proton pumping needed to compensate for the UCP$1$-mediated leak.\n\n$$\\Delta J_{\\mathrm{O_2, UCP1}} = J_{\\mathrm{O_2, total}} - J_{\\mathrm{O_2, basal}} = (32 - 14) \\text{ pmol O}_2 \\text{ s}^{-1} \\text{ mg}^{-1} = 18 \\text{ pmol O}_2 \\text{ s}^{-1} \\text{ mg}^{-1}$$\n\nSecond, we convert this rate of oxygen consumption to the corresponding rate of proton flux. The problem states a stoichiometry of $20$ protons pumped per molecule of $\\mathrm{O_2}$ reduced ($S_{H^+/\\mathrm{O_2}} = 20$). In a steady state, the rate of protons pumped out by the electron transport chain must be equal to the rate of protons leaking back into the matrix. Therefore, the molar flux of protons through UCP$1$, denoted $J_{H^+}$, is:\n\n$$J_{H^+} = \\Delta J_{\\mathrm{O_2, UCP1}} \\times S_{H^+/\\mathrm{O_2}}$$\n$$J_{H^+} = (18 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ mol O}_2 \\text{ s}^{-1} \\text{ mg}^{-1}) \\times \\left(\\frac{20 \\text{ mol H}^{+}}{1 \\text{ mol O}_2}\\right) = 360 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ mol H}^{+} \\text{ s}^{-1} \\text{ mg}^{-1}$$\n\nThird, we convert this molar flux of charged protons into an electrical current, $I_{H^+}$. This is accomplished using the Faraday constant, $F = 96485 \\text{ C mol}^{-1}$, which is the electric charge per mole of elementary charges.\n\n$$I_{H^+} = J_{H^+} \\times F$$\n$$I_{H^+} = (360 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ mol s}^{-1} \\text{ mg}^{-1}) \\times (96485 \\text{ C mol}^{-1})$$\n$$I_{H^+} \\approx 3.47346 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ C s}^{-1} \\text{ mg}^{-1}$$\nRecognizing that $1 \\text{ Ampere (A)} = 1 \\text{ C s}^{-1}$, the current is $I_{H^+} \\approx 3.47346 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ A mg}^{-1}$.\n\nFourth, we can now compute the conductance.
