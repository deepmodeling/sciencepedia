The main transition enthalpy is greater for DSPC ($\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{main}}(\\mathrm{B}) = 49.0~\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$) than for DPPC ($\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{main}}(\\mathrm{A}) = 35.0~\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$). This is because longer saturated acyl chains exhibit stronger cumulative van der Waals interactions. The main transition from the ordered gel phase to the disordered liquid-crystalline phase requires disrupting these interactions. Consequently, more energy is required to \"melt\" the longer chains of DSPC, resulting in a higher transition enthalpy.\n\n2.  **Influence of Cis Unsaturation (Lipid B vs. Lipid C):** Lipid B (DSPC) has saturated $18$-carbon chains, while Lipid C (DOPC) has $18$-carbon chains each containing a cis double bond. The main transition enthalpy for DOPC ($\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{main}}(\\mathrm{C}) = 12.0~\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$) is drastically lower than for DSPC ($\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{main}}(\\mathrm{B}) = 49.0~\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$). The non-linear geometry of the cis double bond introduces a permanent kink in the acyl chain, which hinders tight, ordered packing in the gel phase. As a result, the gel phase of DOPC is inherently more disordered and has weaker inter-chain van der Waals forces compared to the highly ordered gel phase of DSPC. The transition to the liquid-crystalline phase therefore represents a smaller change in entropy and requires significantly less energy, leading to a much lower enthalpy of transition. The near-zero pretransition enthalpy for DOPC ($\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{pre}}(\\mathrm{C}) = 0.100~\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$) is also a consequence of this packing disruption, which destabilizes the highly ordered $L_{\\beta'}$ phase from which the pretransition originates.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1.20  35.0  1.60  49.0  0.100  12.0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2574974"}, {"introduction": "Biological membranes are not uniform but are complex mixtures of different lipids, often leading to the coexistence of distinct physical phases.

The overall composition $x_{\\mathrm{DPPC}}=0.30$ correctly lies within the compositions of the coexisting phases ($0.12  0.30  0.82$), which is a necessary condition for the existence of a two-phase system. The provided miscibility gap data ($0.08$ to $0.88$) serves to confirm that the system is indeed in a phase-separated regime at this temperature, and the specific tie-line compositions ($0.12$ and $0.82$) are the precise values required for the calculation. The problem is valid.\n\nWe proceed with the derivation. Consider a binary system composed of a total of $n$ moles of two components, $A$ and $B$. Let the overall mole fraction of component $A$ be $x_A$. The system separates into two phases, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\nLet $n^{(\\alpha)}$ and $n^{(\\beta)}$ be the total number of moles in phase $\\alpha$ and phase $\\beta$, respectively.\nLet $x_A^{(\\alpha)}$ and $x_A^{(\\beta)}$ be the mole fractions of component $A$ in phase $\\alpha$ and phase $\\beta$, respectively.\n\nThe fundamental condition for phase equilibrium is the equality of the chemical potential of each component across all phases. For this binary system:\n$$ \\mu_A^{(\\alpha)} = \\mu_A^{(\\beta)} $$\n$$ \\mu_B^{(\\alpha)} = \\mu_B^{(\\beta)} $$\nThese thermodynamic constraints establish that for a given temperature and pressure, the compositions of the coexisting phases, $x_A^{(\\alpha)}$ and $x_A^{(\\beta)}$, are fixed quantities.\n\nThe lever rule itself is derived from the principle of mass conservation. The total number of moles of component $A$ in the system, $n_A$, is the sum of the moles of $A$ in each phase:\n$$ n_A = n_A^{(\\alpha)} + n_A^{(\\beta)} $$\nBy definition, the number of moles of a component is the product of its mole fraction and the total number of moles in that phase (or the overall system).

The right side is a perfect sink, so $c_R = 0$.\nSubstituting these boundary conditions into the integrated equation gives:\n$$c_R - c_L = -J \\int_{-d/2}^{+d/2} \\frac{\\exp(\\beta \\Delta G(z))}{D(z)} dz$$\n$$-c_L = -J \\int_{-d/2}^{+d/2} \\frac{\\exp(\\beta \\Delta G(z))}{D(z)} dz$$\nSolving for the flux $J$:\n$$J = \\frac{c_L}{\\int_{-d/2}^{+d/2} \\frac{\\exp(\\beta \\Delta G(z))}{D(z)} dz}$$\nThe permeability coefficient $P$ is defined by $J = P(c_L - c_R)$. Since $c_R = 0$, this simplifies to $J = P c_L$. Comparing this with the expression for $J$ derived above, we obtain the general formula for permeability:\n$$P = \\left(\\int_{-d/2}^{+d/2} \\frac{\\exp(\\beta \\Delta G(z))}{D(z)} dz\\right)^{-1}$$\nThis is the required general expression.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression for the specified profiles:\n- PMF: $\\Delta G(z) = \\Delta G_b - \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa z^2$\n- Diffusivity: $D(z) = D_0$\nSubstituting these into the integral for the inverse permeability, $1/P$:\n$$\\frac{1}{P} = \\int_{-d/2}^{+d/2} \\frac{\\exp\\left[\\beta\\left(\\Delta G_b - \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa z^2\\right)\\right]}{D_0} dz = \\frac{\\exp(\\beta \\Delta G_b)}{D_0} \\int_{-d/2}^{+d/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta \\kappa}{2}z^2\\right) dz$$\nThe integral is of a Gaussian function. Its solution is expressed in terms of the error function, $\\mathrm{erf}(x) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\int_0^x \\exp(-t^2)dt$.\nLet $a = \\frac{\\beta \\kappa}{2}$. The integral is $\\int_{-d/2}^{+d/2} \\exp(-az^2) dz$. Using the substitution $u = \\sqrt{a}z$, we find $dz = du/\\sqrt{a}$. The limits become $-\\sqrt{a}d/2$ and $+\\sqrt{a}d/2$.\n$$\\int_{-d/2}^{+d/2} \\exp(-az^2) dz = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}} \\int_{-\\sqrt{a}d/2}^{+\\sqrt{a}d/2} \\exp(-u^2) du = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{\\sqrt{a}}\\mathrm{erf}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{a}d}{2}\\right)$$\nSubstituting $a = \\frac{\\beta \\kappa}{2}$ back:\n$$\\int_{-d/2}^{+d/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta \\kappa}{2}z^2\\right) dz = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta \\kappa}} \\mathrm{erf}\\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta \\kappa}{2}}\\right)$$\nTherefore, the inverse permeability is:\n$$\\frac{1}{P} = \\frac{\\exp(\\beta \\Delta G_b)}{D_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta \\kappa}} \\mathrm{erf}\\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta \\kappa}{2}}\\right)$$\nAnd the permeability coefficient $P$ is:\n$$P = D_0 \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta G_b) \\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta \\kappa}{2\\pi}} \\left[\\mathrm{erf}\\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta \\kappa}{2}}\\right)\\right]^{-1}$$\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $D_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$\n- $\\Delta G_b = 25\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $\\kappa = 12.5\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}\\,nm^{-2}}$\n- $d = 4.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n- $R = 8.314462618 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n- $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n\nFirst, calculate $\\beta$:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{1}{RT} = \\frac{1}{(8.314462618 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})(298\\,\\mathrm{K})} \\approx 0.4035978\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kJ^{-1}}$$\nNext, we calculate the dimensionless terms.\nThe exponential term:\n$$\\beta \\Delta G_b \\approx (0.4035978\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kJ^{-1}})(25\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}) \\approx 10.0899$$\n$$\\exp(-\\beta \\Delta G_b) \\approx \\exp(-10.0899) \\approx 4.150 \\times 10^{-5}$$\nThe term $\\beta \\kappa$ has units of $\\mathrm{nm^{-2}}$:\n$$\\beta \\kappa \\approx (0.4035978\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kJ^{-1}})(12.5\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}\\,nm^{-2}}) \\approx 5.0450\\,\\mathrm{nm^{-2}}$$\nThe argument of the error function, which must be dimensionless:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{d}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta \\kappa}{2}} \\approx \\frac{4.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{5.0450\\,\\mathrm{nm^{-2}}}{2}} \\approx 2.0 \\times \\sqrt{2.5225} \\approx 2.0 \\times 1.5882 \\approx 3.176$$\n$$\\mathrm{erf}(\\alpha) \\approx \\mathrm{erf}(3.176) \\approx 0.9999926$$\nThis value is very close to $1$ and its inverse will have a negligible effect on the final result at the required precision.\n\nThe pre-factor $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta \\kappa}{2\\pi}}$ must be in units of $\\mathrm{m^{-1}}$ to yield $P$ in $\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$.\n$$\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta \\kappa}{2\\pi}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{5.0450\\,\\mathrm{nm^{-2}}}{2\\pi}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.8029\\,\\mathrm{nm^{-2}}} \\approx 0.8961\\,\\mathrm{nm^{-1}}$$\nConverting to SI units: $1\\,\\mathrm{nm^{-1}} = 10^9\\,\\mathrm{m^{-1}}$, so:\n$$\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta \\kappa}{2\\pi}} \\approx 0.8961 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{m^{-1}}$$\nNow, we assemble all parts to calculate $P$:\n$$P \\approx (1.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (4.150 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times (0.8961 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{m^{-1}}) \\times (0.9999926)^{-1}$$\n$$P \\approx (1.0 \\times 4.150 \\times 0.8961) \\times 10^{-10-5+9}\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$$\n$$P \\approx 3.7188 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as instructed:\n$$P \\approx 3.72 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.72 \\times 10^{-6}}\n$$", "id": "2575040"}]}
