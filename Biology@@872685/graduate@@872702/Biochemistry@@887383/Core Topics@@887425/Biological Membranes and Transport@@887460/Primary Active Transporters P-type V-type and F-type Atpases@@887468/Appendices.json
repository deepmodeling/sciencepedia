The description of the P-type ATPase mechanism, including the role of the conserved Aspartate, the formation of an acyl phosphate intermediate, coupling to ion transport, and inhibition by orthovanadate as a transition-state analog, are all fundamental and well-established concepts in biochemistry. The properties of Asp and Asn are correctly described. The experimental design (site-directed mutagenesis followed by functional assays) is a standard method for probing protein function. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive a logical conclusion. It does not violate any principles of scientific or logical integrity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe analysis will proceed by considering the direct chemical and functional consequences of substituting the Aspartate residue with Asparagine, based on the provided principles.\n\n1.  **Effect on Autophosphorylation (Assay i):**\n    Principle (a) states that the enzyme cycle involves the formation of a high-energy acyl phosphate on a conserved Asp. Principle (b) specifies that the side-chain carboxylate ($\\mathrm{-COO^-}$) of Asp provides the nucleophile for this phosphoryl transfer. The reaction involves a nucleophilic attack from one of the carboxylate oxygens onto the terminal ($\\gamma$) phosphate of ATP.\n    Principle (c) states that Asparagine (Asn) has a neutral, non-nucleophilic amide group ($\\mathrm{-CONH_2}$) in place of the carboxylate. The lone pair of electrons on the amide nitrogen is delocalized by resonance with the carbonyl oxygen, rendering the nitrogen non-nucleophilic. The carbonyl oxygen is also a very poor nucleophile.\n    Therefore, the Asn residue at the catalytic site lacks the required nucleophile to attack ATP. The formation of the covalent phosphoenzyme intermediate (Enzyme-P) is chemically impossible. As a result, when the mutant protein is incubated with $\\gamma\\text{-}^{32}\\text{P}$-ATP, there will be no transfer of the radioactive phosphate group to the protein.\n    Prediction for Assay (i): **No detectable autophosphorylation.**\n\n2.  **Effect on Vectorial Ion Transport (Assay ii):**\n    Principle (a) explicitly states that the covalent phosphorylation \"is required to drive coupled ion transport\". The phosphorylation event provides the free energy for the major conformational change from the $E_1$ state to the $E_2$ state, which is the ion-translocating step.\n    Since the Asp$\\to$Asn mutation prevents the initial phosphorylation step, the enzyme cannot proceed through its catalytic cycle. It will be arrested in the initial $E_1$ state, unable to bind ATP productively and unable to transition to the $E_2$ state. Consequently, it cannot perform its function of transporting ions across the membrane.\n    Prediction for Assay (ii): **No ATP-driven ion transport.**\n\n3.  **Effect on Orthovanadate Sensitivity (Assay iii):**\n    Principle (b) states that the Asp carboxylate is necessary \"for orthovanadate trapping of a phosphoenzyme-like state\". Orthovanadate ($\\text{VO}_4^{3-}$), as a phosphate mimic, forms a stable complex in the active site that resembles the transition state of phosphoryl transfer. This interaction requires the same residues that coordinate the phosphate group, critically including the negatively charged Asp carboxylate which would normally be phosphorylated.\n    The Asn mutation replaces this negatively charged carboxylate with a neutral amide group. The mutant active site lacks the essential electrostatic and coordinating features required to bind the negatively charged orthovanadate ion and form the stable, inhibitory $E_2 \\cdot \\mathrm{V_i}$ complex.\n    Prediction for Assay (iii): **Loss of orthovanadate sensitivity.**\n\n**Summary of Predictions for the Mutant:**\n-   Autophosphorylation: Absent.\n-   Ion Transport: Absent.\n-   Orthovanadate Sensitivity: Lost.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. No detectable autophosphorylation; no ATP-driven ion transport; loss of orthovanadate sensitivity. Mechanism: removal of the Asp carboxylate eliminates formation of the aspartyl phosphate and the orthovanadate-trappable site, arresting the $E_1 \\rightleftharpoons E_2$ cycle.**\nThis option's predictions for the three assays are identical to those derived from the first principles. The mechanism provided is also correct: the mutation removes the nucleophile for phosphorylation and the binding site for the transition-state analog, vanadate, thereby halting the entire catalytic cycle. This is the most chemically and mechanistically sound conclusion.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Severely reduced but nonzero autophosphorylation; proportionally reduced ion transport; increased orthovanadate sensitivity because the $E_2$-like state is stabilized by the mutation. Mechanism: the Asn side chain sterically hinders but does not abolish phosphoryl transfer, favoring vanadate trapping.**\nThis option is incorrect. The Asn side chain does not merely cause steric hindrance; it lacks the necessary chemical reactivity (nucleophilicity) for phosphorylation. Any autophosphorylation would be negligible at best, not merely \"severely reduced\". The claim of increased vanadate sensitivity is also incorrect, as the binding site for vanadate is destroyed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Unchanged autophosphorylation via alternative transfer to a nearby Serine; normal ion transport; unchanged orthovanadate sensitivity. Mechanism: water-mediated relay shifts phosphorylation to a serine hydroxyl, preserving the cycle.**\nThis option is incorrect. It invokes a speculative mechanism of switching the phosphorylation site to a Serine. Enzyme active sites are highly specific, and such a \"rerouting\" is extremely unlikely without substantial re-engineering. There is no basis in the problem to assume such an event occurs and restores function.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Switch to a phosphohistidine intermediate on a neighboring Histidine; slowed ion transport; modest decrease in orthovanadate sensitivity. Mechanism: the catalytic machinery reroutes to a histidine nucleophile that is less reactive.**\nThis option is incorrect for the same reason as option C. It proposes a speculative switch to a Histidine residue, which is not characteristic of P-type ATPase mechanisms. The high specificity of the active site makes such an alternative pathway highly improbable.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Autophosphorylation proceeds but the enzyme is kinetically trapped in $E_1\\sim P$; ion transport is abolished due to blocked $E_1\\to E_2$ transition; orthovanadate sensitivity is increased due to accumulation of a phosphoenzyme-like state. Mechanism: the Asn alters the equilibrium among conformational states without preventing phosphorylation.**\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. Its primary premise, that autophosphorylation proceeds, is incorrect. As established, the Asn mutant cannot form the phosphoenzyme intermediate ($E_1 \\sim P$). Therefore, it cannot be trapped in this state.
