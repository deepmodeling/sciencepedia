This analysis is based on the principles of mass-action kinetics.\n\nLet $[E]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ represent the total concentration of the homodimeric ABC transporter. Each dimer possesses a certain number of catalytically competent sites, denoted by $n$. The total concentration of these active sites in the solution, $[S]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, is the product of the number of sites per dimer and the total concentration of dimers:\n$$\n[S]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = n [E]_{\\mathrm{tot}}\n$$\n\nThe experimental setup ensures that ATP is saturating and its binding is effectively instantaneous. The pre-steady-state burst reflects a single, rapid chemical step (ATP hydrolysis) occurring at each competent site before a slower, rate-limiting step (e.g., product release or conformational reset) takes over. This initial burst phase is modeled using first-order kinetics. Let $[S](t)$ be the concentration of competent sites that have not yet undergone hydrolysis at time $t$. The rate of depletion of these sites is given by the first-order rate law:\n$$\n\\frac{d[S](t)}{dt} = -k_{b} [S](t)\n$$\nHere, $k_{b}$ is the apparent rate constant of the burst phase. The initial condition, at time $t=0$, is that all competent sites are available for reaction, so $[S](0) = [S]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = n [E]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\n\nIntegration of this differential equation from $t=0$ to $t$ yields the concentration of unreacted sites as a function of time:\n$$\n[S](t) = [S](0) \\exp(-k_{b} t) = n [E]_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\exp(-k_{b} t)\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the hydrolysis of one molecule of ATP produces one molecule of inorganic phosphate, $P$. The concentration of phosphate generated during the burst phase, $P_{\\text{burst}}(t)$, is therefore equal to the concentration of sites that have completed hydrolysis. By the principle of mass conservation for the population of competent sites, this concentration is:\n$$\nP_{\\text{burst}}(t) = [S]_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [S](t)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $[S]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ and $[S](t)$ derived above:\n$$\nP_{\\text{burst}}(t) = n [E]_{\\mathrm{tot}} - n [E]_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\exp(-k_{b} t)\n$$\nFactoring out the common term $n [E]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ gives the expression for the phosphate produced in the burst:\n$$\nP_{\\text{burst}}(t) = n [E]_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\left(1 - \\exp(-k_{b} t)\\right)\n$$\n\nThe total concentration of phosphate at time $t$, $P(t)$, is the sum of the phosphate from this initial burst and the phosphate generated during the subsequent linear, steady-state phase, which occurs at a constant velocity $v_{\\mathrm{ss}}$. The phosphate from the steady-state phase is $v_{\\mathrm{ss}} t$. Thus, the complete theoretical model for $P(t)$ is:\n$$\nP(t) = n [E]_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\left(1 - \\exp(-k_{b} t)\\right) + v_{\\mathrm{ss}} t\n$$\n\nThis derived equation must be compared with the empirical function provided in the problem statement, which is used to fit the experimental data:\n$$\nP(t) = A\\left(1 - \\exp(-k_{b} t)\\right) + v_{\\mathrm{ss}}\\, t\n$$\nBy equating the coefficients of the corresponding terms in the theoretical and empirical equations, we establish a direct physical meaning for the burst amplitude $A$. The pre-exponential factor, $A$, is identified as the total concentration of catalytically competent sites:\n$$\nA = n [E]_{\\mathrm{tot}}\n$$\nThis is the required relationship. It demonstrates that the burst amplitude measures the concentration of active sites that rapidly perform one round of catalysis before the enzyme enters the slower steady-state cycle.\n\nTo compute the numerical value of $n$, we rearrange this relationship:\n$$\nn = \\frac{A}{[E]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}\n$$\nThe problem provides the following experimental values:\n- Burst amplitude, $A = 0.92~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- Total enzyme concentration (as dimer), $[E]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 1.00~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $n$:\n$$\nn = \\frac{0.92~\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{1.00~\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = 0.92\n$$\nThe result is a dimensionless quantity, as expected.
