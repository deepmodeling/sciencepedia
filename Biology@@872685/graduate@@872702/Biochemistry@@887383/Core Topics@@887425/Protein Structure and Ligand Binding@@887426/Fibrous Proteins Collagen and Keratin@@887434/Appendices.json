It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information and assumptions required for a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two parts: first, the calculation of the expected counts of glycine (Gly), proline (Pro), and hydroxyproline (Hyp) in a collagen chain; second, a mechanistic justification for how this composition influences triple-helix stability.\n\nPart 1: Calculation of Expected Counts\n\nThe total number of residues in the polypeptide chain is given as $N = 1000$. The chain follows a repeating Gly–X–Y motif. The problem states to assume that the expected fraction of residues in each of the $3$ positions (Glycine, $X$, and $Y$) is $1/3$ of the total chain length.\n\nTherefore, the expected number of positions of each type is:\n-   Number of Glycine positions: $N_{\\text{pos, Gly}} = N \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1000}{3}$\n-   Number of X positions: $N_{\\text{pos, X}} = N \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1000}{3}$\n-   Number of Y positions: $N_{\\text{pos, Y}} = N \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1000}{3}$\n\nWe can now compute the expected count for each specified amino acid.\n\n1.  Expected count of Glycine ($N_{\\text{Gly}}$):\n    The Gly–X–Y motif dictates that every first position in the triplet is occupied by a glycine residue. Therefore, the expected number of glycine residues is equal to the expected number of glycine positions.\n    $$N_{\\text{Gly}} = N_{\\text{pos, Gly}} = \\frac{1000}{3}$$\n\n2.  Expected count of Proline ($N_{\\text{Pro}}$):\n    The problem states that proline appears only in the $X$ position. The fraction of $X$ positions occupied by proline is given as $f_{\\text{Pro}|X} = 0.25$.\n    The expected number of proline residues is the total number of $X$ positions multiplied by this fraction.\n    $$N_{\\text{Pro}} = N_{\\text{pos, X}} \\times f_{\\text{Pro}|X} = \\frac{1000}{3} \\times 0.25 = \\frac{1000}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1000}{12} = \\frac{250}{3}$$\n\n3.  Expected count of Hydroxyproline ($N_{\\text{Hyp}}$):\n    The problem states that hydroxyproline appears only in the $Y$ position. The fraction of $Y$ positions occupied by hydroxyproline is given as $f_{\\text{Hyp}|Y} = 0.25$.\n    The expected number of hydroxyproline residues is the total number of $Y$ positions multiplied by this fraction.\n    $$N_{\\text{Hyp}} = N_{\\text{pos, Y}} \\times f_{\\text{Hyp}|Y} = \\frac{1000}{3} \\times 0.25 = \\frac{1000}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1000}{12} = \\frac{250}{3}$$\nThe problem requires exact expressions, and these results are left as fractions.\n\nPart 2: Mechanistic Justification for Triple-Helix Stability\n\nThe stability of the collagen triple helix is critically dependent on its unique amino acid composition, particularly the roles of Gly, Pro, and Hyp in their specified positions.\n\n1.  Role of Glycine (Gly):\n    The collagen triple helix is a right-handed superhelix composed of $3$ left-handed polypeptide chains. The structure is exceptionally compact, with the side chains of every third residue pointing towards the central axis of the superhelix. Glycine is the only amino acid with a side chain small enough (a single hydrogen atom) to fit within this sterically hindered space. The presence of any other amino acid with a larger side chain (even alanine, with a methyl group) at this position would lead to severe steric clashes, preventing the proper packing of the $3$ chains and thus destabilizing or completely disrupting the triple-helical structure. The absolute requirement of glycine at every third position is the most fundamental constraint for collagen folding.\n\n2.  Role of Proline (Pro) in the X position:\n    Proline is an imino acid, meaning its side chain forms a cyclic structure by bonding back to the backbone amide nitrogen. This pyrrolidine ring severely restricts the rotational freedom around the backbone dihedral angle $\\phi$ (N–C$_{\\alpha}$ bond), fixing it at approximately $\\phi \\approx -60^\\circ$ to $-75^\\circ$. This value is highly compatible with the conformation required for the left-handed polyproline type II (PPII) helix, which is the structure adopted by individual collagen chains before they assemble into the triple helix. By conformationally pre-organizing the polypeptide backbone into the required geometry, proline residues in the $X$ position reduce the entropic cost of folding. This favorable entropic contribution significantly stabilizes the final triple-helical assembly.\n\n3.  Role of Hydroxyproline (Hyp) in the Y position:\n    Hydroxyproline is formed by the post-translational hydroxylation of proline residues that are incorporated in the $Y$ position of the Gly-X-Y triplet. The hydroxyl group ($-\\text{OH}$) on the $C_4$ carbon of the pyrrolidine ring is the key to its stabilizing effect, which operates through two primary mechanisms:\n    a) Stereoelectronic Effects: The electronegative hydroxyl group alters the favored pucker of the pyrrolidine ring. While proline prefers a $C_{\\gamma}$-exo pucker, hydroxyproline favors a $C_{\\gamma}$-endo pucker. This $C_{\\gamma}$-endo conformation aligns the backbone dihedral angles ($\\phi$, $\\psi$) even more favorably for the PPII helical structure, providing an additional element of conformational pre-organization and stability beyond that offered by proline.\n    b) Hydration and Hydrogen Bonding: The hydroxyl group of Hyp is a potent hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor. It forms a highly ordered network of hydrogen bonds with surrounding water molecules. These \"water bridges\" can link adjacent chains within the triple helix or stabilize the conformation of a single chain, effectively creating a \"hydration shell\" that buttresses the entire structure. This extensive hydrogen-bonding network provides a large, favorable enthalpic contribution to the stability of the triple helix, which is a major factor in raising its melting temperature ($T_m$) well above normal physiological temperatures. The absence of Hyp, as seen in vitamin C deficiency (scurvy), leads to a drastic decrease in collagen thermal stability and results in functionally defective connective tissue.\n\nIn summary, the Gly-X-Y motif provides a hierarchical system of stabilization: Glycine enables the fundamental packing of the helix, Proline entropically favors the correct chain conformation, and Hydroxyproline provides further conformational and enthalpic stabilization through stereoelectronic effects and structured hydration.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1000}{3} & \\frac{250}{3} & \\frac{250}{3} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2564148"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principles of structural stability, we now turn to its quantitative measurement.

Consequently, $\\Delta G(T_m) = -RT_m \\ln(1) = 0$.\nFrom the definition of Gibbs free energy, we have $\\Delta G(T_m) = \\Delta H - T_m \\Delta S = 0$, which yields the important relationship:\n$$\n\\Delta S = \\frac{\\Delta H}{T_m}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\Delta S$ back into the equation for $K(T)$ gives the van 't Hoff equation for a two-state transition:\n$$\nK(T) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H}{RT} + \\frac{\\Delta H}{RT_m}\\right) = \\exp\\left[\\frac{\\Delta H}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{T_m} - \\frac{1}{T}\\right)\\right]\n$$\nThe excess molar heat capacity, $C_{p,\\mathrm{ex}}(T)$, measured by DSC is the temperature derivative of the excess enthalpy of the system. The excess enthalpy, $\\langle H(T) \\rangle$, is the enthalpy of the ensemble relative to the fully folded state, which is given by $\\langle H(T) \\rangle = \\alpha(T) \\Delta H$. Thus:\n$$\nC_{p,\\mathrm{ex}}(T) = \\frac{d\\langle H(T) \\rangle}{dT} = \\Delta H \\frac{d\\alpha(T)}{dT}\n$$\nWe must now find the derivative of $\\alpha(T)$ with respect to $T$.

At $T=T_m$, we know $K(T_m)=1$. The term $\\frac{K}{(1+K)^2}$ becomes $\\frac{1}{(1+1)^2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.

The actual melting process is more complex, leading to deviations from the ideal two-state behavior predicted above. Two specific features that cause such deviations are:\n$1$. The existence of thermodynamically populated intermediates: The unwinding of a long triple helix does not occur in a single, concerted step. Instead, it is more likely to initiate at less stable regions (like the ends) and propagate, akin to a zipper mechanism. This process inevitably populates intermediate states where segments of the triple helix are unwound while others remain intact. A true two-state transition requires these intermediates to be of high energy and thus negligibly populated. For a polymer, the presence of these intermediates broadens the melting transition observed by DSC, making the peak wider and shorter than predicted by the shape analysis of a pure two-state model.\n$2$. Non-zero change in heat capacity upon unfolding ($\\Delta C_p \\neq 0$): The problem assumes temperature-independence of $\\Delta H$ and $\\Delta S$, which is equivalent to assuming that the heat capacity of the helix and coil states are identical ($\\Delta C_p = C_{p,C} - C_{p,H} = 0$). In reality, the unfolded coil state has significantly more conformational and vibrational freedom and exposes hydrophobic residues to the aqueous solvent, resulting in a large, positive $\\Delta C_p$. A non-zero $\\Delta C_p$ means that $\\Delta H$ and $\\Delta S$ are themselves functions of temperature. This causes the baseline of the DSC thermogram to shift after the transition and makes the transition peak asymmetric, contrary to the symmetric shape (in $1/T$ space) predicted by the simple van 't Hoff analysis. This also leads to a discrepancy between the van 't Hoff enthalpy (calculated from peak shape, as we did) and the calorimetric enthalpy (calculated from the total area under the peak).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{893.4}\n$$", "id": "2564098"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice moves from analyzing stability to actively engineering protein behavior, shifting our focus to the α-helical coiled-coils of keratin.

This is consistent with our analysis. The hydrophobic core ($I_1, L_4, V_8, L_{11}$) is stable. The electrostatic interactions in an A-A homodimer are of the $e-g'$ type: $E_5...K'_7$ and $D_{12}...K'_{14}$. These are attractive electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) between negatively and positively charged residues, which stabilize the homodimer.\n\nThe objective is to redesign Keratin A (let us call the redesigned version A*) to favor heterodimerization with B and disfavor homodimerization of A*.\n\n1.  **Preserve Structural Integrity**: The problem states that disrupting the $a/d$ core destabilizes the structure. Therefore, the hydrophobic residues at positions $a$ ($I_1, V_8$) and $d$ ($L_4, L_{11}$) in Keratin A must not be mutated.\n\n2.  **Disfavor A*-A* Homodimerization**: To prevent the formation of the A* homodimer, we must introduce repulsive forces at the primary electrostatic interface. This can be achieved by ensuring the interacting $e$ and $g$ positions in A* have the same charge. For an $e-g'$ interaction, this means if position $e$ is positive, position $g$ must also be positive, leading to electrostatic repulsion in the homodimer.\n\n3.  **Favor A*-B Heterodimerization**: To promote the A*-B heterodimer, the $e$ and $g$ positions of A* must be electrostatically complementary to those of B. Keratin B has exclusively acidic (negative) residues at all its $e$ and $g$ positions ($E_5, D_7, E_{12}, E_{14}$). Therefore, for maximal attraction, the redesigned Keratin A* must have exclusively basic (positive) residues at its $e$ and $g$ positions.\n\nCombining these requirements, the optimal strategy for redesigning Keratin A is:\n- Keep the hydrophobic core ($a$ and $d$ positions) unchanged.\n- Mutate all acidic residues at the $e$ and $g$ positions to basic residues.\n- Keep all existing basic residues at the $e$ and $g$ positions.\n\nApplying this strategy to Keratin A:\n- Position $e_5$: Currently $E$ (acidic). Must be mutated to a basic residue (e.g., $K$ or $R$).\n- Position $g_7$: Currently $K$ (basic). No change needed.\n- Position $e_{12}$: Currently $D$ (acidic). Must be mutated to a basic residue (e.g., $K$ or $R$).\n- Position $g_{14}$: Currently $K$ (basic). No change needed.\n\nThis strategy leads to a redesigned Keratin A* with a fully basic electrostatic interface ($e/g$ positions), which creates repulsion in the A*-A* homodimer but strong attraction in the A*-B heterodimer. This is also a minimal mutation strategy, as it only alters the residues necessary to switch specificity.\n\nNow, we evaluate each provided option.\n\n**A. Interface residues are at positions $a$ and $d$. Preserve $a/d$ hydrophobics (I, L, V, L at positions $1,4,8,11$). Mutate $e/g$ in Keratin A to basic residues to create like-charge repulsion in the A–A homodimer and electrostatic attraction to Keratin B’s acidic pattern: $5\\!:\\!E \\rightarrow K$, $7\\!:\\!K$ unchanged (basic), $12\\!:\\!D \\rightarrow R$, $14\\!:\\!K$ unchanged (basic). Leave $b,c,f$ unchanged.**\n\nThis option correctly identifies the need to preserve the $a/d$ hydrophobic core. While it initially misstates that the interface residues *are* $a$ and $d$, the subsequent text correctly clarifies their role and focuses on mutating the $e/g$ electrostatic interface. The proposed mutations ($E_5 \\rightarrow K$ and $D_{12} \\rightarrow R$) and the decision to keep $K_7$ and $K_{14}$ perfectly align with our derived strategy. This design will create a fully basic $e/g$ pattern in Keratin A, which repels itself and attracts the fully acidic pattern of Keratin B. The strategy is minimal and effective.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Interface residues are at positions $b$ and $f$. To enforce heterodimerization, mutate core $a/d$ residues in Keratin A to acidic residues to create new salt bridges: $1\\!:\\!I \\rightarrow E$, $4\\!:\\!L \\rightarrow D$, $8\\!:\\!V \\rightarrow E$, $11\\!:\\!L \\rightarrow D$; keep $e/g$ unchanged.**\n\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. It misidentifies the interface residues as $b$ and $f$, which are typically solvent-exposed and do not form the core interface. More critically, it proposes mutating the hydrophobic core residues ($a,d$) into charged residues. This violates the principle of preserving structural integrity, as it would destroy the hydrophobic packing essential for coiled-coil formation, leading to destabilization or unfolding.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Interface residues are at positions $a$ and $d$. Preserve $a/d$ hydrophobics, but mutate Keratin A to match Keratin B’s acidic pattern at $e/g$: $5\\!:\\!E$ unchanged (acidic), $7\\!:\\!K \\rightarrow E$, $12\\!:\\!D$ unchanged (acidic), $14\\!:\\!K \\rightarrow D$.**\n\nThis option correctly preserves the $a/d$ core. However, the proposed mutation strategy is counterproductive. By making the $e/g$ positions of Keratin A fully acidic, it creates a protein that matches Keratin B. While this would successfully create repulsion in the redesigned A-A homodimer, it would also create strong repulsion in the A-B heterodimer (acidic interacting with acidic). The goal is to *favor* heterodimerization, not prevent it.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Interface residues are at positions $a$ and $d$. Preserve $a/d$ hydrophobics. To change specificity without altering $e/g$, introduce opposite charges on the solvent-exposed positions $b,c,f$ to complement Keratin B: $2\\!:\\!E \\rightarrow K$, $3\\!:\\!S \\rightarrow E$, $6\\!:\\!Q \\rightarrow K$, $9\\!:\\!N \\rightarrow E$, $10\\!:\\!A \\rightarrow K$, $13\\!:\\!S \\rightarrow E$; keep $e/g$ unchanged.**\n\nThis option correctly preserves the $a/d$ core but pursues a flawed strategy. It ignores the primary determinants of coiled-coil specificity—the $e/g$ electrostatic interactions. By leaving the $e/g$ positions of Keratin A unchanged, the favorable interactions ($E_5...K'_7$, etc.) that promote homodimerization are retained. While interactions at solvent-exposed positions ($b,c,f$) can provide minor stabilization, they are insufficient to overcome the powerful specificity encoded at the $e/g$ interface. Furthermore, proposing $6$ mutations when only $2$ are needed at the crucial positions makes this strategy non-minimal and misguided.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on a systematic application of coiled-coil design principles, Option A is the only one that proposes a scientifically valid, minimal, and effective strategy to achieve the stated objectives.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2564129"}]}
