There are no internal contradictions.

It is therefore deemed **valid**. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe objective is to find a relationship between $r$ and $B$. Let $n_{L}$ be the moles of bound ligand, $m_{\\text{prot}}$ be the mass of total protein, and $n_{\\text{rec}}$ be the moles of receptor macromolecule.\n\nFrom the given definitions:\n$$B = \\frac{n_{L}}{m_{\\text{prot}}}$$\n$$r = \\frac{n_{L}}{n_{\\text{rec}}}$$\n\nWe can express $n_{L}$ from the first equation as $n_{L} = B \\cdot m_{\\text{prot}}$ and substitute it into the second equation:\n$$r = \\frac{B \\cdot m_{\\text{prot}}}{n_{\\text{rec}}}$$\nThis expression shows that $r$ is proportional to $B$, with the conversion factor being the ratio of total protein mass to moles of receptor, $\\frac{m_{\\text{prot}}}{n_{\\text{rec}}}$. We must now evaluate this ratio.\n\nThe mass of the receptor, $m_{\\text{rec}}$, in a sample containing a total protein mass $m_{\\text{prot}}$ is given by the receptor mass fraction $p$:\n$$m_{\\text{rec}} = p \\cdot m_{\\text{prot}}$$\nThe moles of receptor, $n_{\\text{rec}}$, is related to its mass, $m_{\\text{rec}}$, by its molar mass, $M$:\n$$n_{\\text{rec}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{rec}}}{M} = \\frac{p \\cdot m_{\\text{prot}}}{M}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $n_{\\text{rec}}$ back into our equation for $r$:\n$$r = \\frac{B \\cdot m_{\\text{prot}}}{\\left(\\frac{p \\cdot m_{\\text{prot}}}{M}\\right)}$$\nThe term $m_{\\text{prot}}$, representing the arbitrary mass of total protein in a hypothetical sample, cancels out:\n$$r = B \\cdot \\frac{M}{p}$$\nThis derived relationship is of fundamental importance. It demonstrates that the fractional occupancy $r$ can be calculated from the specific binding $B$ using only the receptor's molecular weight $M$ and its mass fraction $p$. The result is independent of the amount of material used in the experiment, and therefore independent of the assay volume $V$ and the total protein concentration $C_{\\mathrm{prot}}$. These are parameters of a specific experimental instance, whereas $B$, $r$, $M$, and $p$ are intensive properties or constants of the system.\n\nWe now calculate the value of $r$ using the provided data. It is critical to maintain unit consistency.\n-   $B = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{pmol} \\cdot \\mathrm{mg}^{-1} = 0.25 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{mol} \\cdot (10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{g})^{-1} = 0.25 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{g}^{-1}$\n-   $M = 400\\,\\mathrm{kDa} = 400 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{g} \\cdot \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} = 4.0 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{g} \\cdot \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$\n-   $p = 2.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ (dimensionless, representing $\\mathrm{g}_{\\text{receptor}}/\\mathrm{g}_{\\text{total protein}}$)\n\nSubstitute these values into the derived formula:\n$$r = (0.25 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{mol}_{\\text{ligand}} \\cdot \\mathrm{g}_{\\text{prot}}^{-1}) \\cdot \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{g}_{\\text{rec}} \\cdot \\mathrm{mol}_{\\text{rec}}^{-1}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{g}_{\\text{rec}} \\cdot \\mathrm{g}_{\\text{prot}}^{-1}}$$\nThe units combine as $(\\mathrm{mol}_{\\text{ligand}}/\\mathrm{g}_{\\text{prot}}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{g}_{\\text{rec}}/\\mathrm{mol}_{\\text{rec}}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{g}_{\\text{prot}}/\\mathrm{g}_{\\text{rec}}) = \\mathrm{mol}_{\\text{ligand}}/\\mathrm{mol}_{\\text{rec}}$, which is the correct unit for $r$.\n\nPerforming the numerical calculation:\n$$r = \\frac{0.25 \\times 10^{-9} \\times 4.0 \\times 10^5}{2.0 \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-4}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.50$$\nThus, $r = 0.50$ moles of ligand bound per mole of macromolecule.\n\nTo verify, we can use the extraneous information ($V$ and $C_{\\mathrm{prot}}$) to compute absolute quantities in the reaction tube.\n-   Total protein mass: $m_{\\text{prot,total}} = C_{\\mathrm{prot}} \\cdot V = (2.0\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}) \\cdot (0.10\\,\\mathrm{mL}) = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n-   Moles of bound ligand: $n_{L} = B \\cdot m_{\\text{prot,total}} = (0.25\\,\\mathrm{pmol/mg}) \\cdot (0.20\\,\\mathrm{mg}) = 0.050\\,\\mathrm{pmol}$.\n-   Mass of receptor: $m_{\\text{rec}} = p \\cdot m_{\\text{prot,total}} = (2.0 \\times 10^{-4}) \\cdot (0.20\\,\\mathrm{mg}) = 4.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n-   Moles of receptor: $n_{\\text{rec}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{rec}}}{M}$. We need $M$ in units of $\\mathrm{mg/pmol}$.\n    $M = 4.0 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{g/mol} = 4.0 \\times 10^5\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{mol}} \\times \\frac{10^3\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{1\\,\\mathrm{g}} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{mol}}{10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{pmol}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{mg/pmol}$.\n    $n_{\\text{rec}} = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{4.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{mg/pmol}} = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{pmol}$.\n-   Finally, compute $r$: $r = \\frac{n_{L}}{n_{\\text{rec}}} = \\frac{0.050\\,\\mathrm{pmol}}{0.10\\,\\mathrm{pmol}} = 0.50$.\nThis confirms the result and demonstrates explicitly that while $V$ and $C_{\\mathrm{prot}}$ can be used, they are not necessary.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options.\n\n**A. $r = 0.50$ per macromolecule; $r$ is independent of assay volume $V$ and total protein concentration $C_{\\mathrm{prot}}$.**\nOur calculation yields $r = 0.50$. Our derivation of the formula $r = B \\cdot M/p$ proves that $r$ is independent of $V$ and $C_{\\mathrm{prot}}$, as these are properties of the specific sample, not fundamental properties required for the conversion between two normalized measures of binding.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. $r = 0.125$ per macromolecule; $r$ is independent of assay volume $V$ and total protein concentration $C_{\\mathrm{prot}}$.**\nThe numerical value $r=0.125$ is incorrect. This value would be obtained if one were to erroneously use the subunit molecular weight ($100\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$) instead of the macromolecule molecular weight ($400\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$), as $0.50 / 4 = 0.125$. However, the problem defines $r$ with respect to the macromolecule.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $r = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ per macromolecule; $r$ depends on assay volume $V$.**\nThe numerical value is incorrect. Furthermore, the claim that $r$ depends on $V$ is false, as demonstrated by the derivation.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $r$ cannot be computed from the given information without additionally knowing $V$ and $C_{\\mathrm{prot}}$ because $B$ is normalized per mass rather than per tube.**\nThis statement is false. The conversion from $B$ (normalized per mass of total protein) to $r$ (normalized per mole of receptor) requires only the molecular weight of the receptor and its fractional mass, not the absolute quantities in the tube. The derivation $r = B \\cdot M/p$ proves that the calculation is possible with the given information, and that $V$ and $C_{\\mathrm{prot}}$ are superfluous.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2544762"}, {"introduction": "Once binding data has been properly normalized, the Scatchard plot provides a classic graphical method for estimating the key parameters of the interaction.

A complete solution will now be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe fundamental process is the reversible binding equilibrium:\n$$P + L \\rightleftharpoons PL$$\nThe dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the law of mass action at equilibrium as:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[P][L]}{[PL]}$$\nwhere $[P]$ and $[L]$ are the concentrations of free protein and free ligand, respectively, and $[PL]$ is the concentration of the protein-ligand complex.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Exact Dissociation Constant ($K_{d,\\text{exact}}$)**\n\nWe must first determine the concentrations of the free species using the principles of mass conservation. The total concentrations are the sum of the free and bound forms:\n$$[P]_T = [P] + [PL]$$\n$$[L]_T = [L] + [PL]$$\nWe are given $[P]_T = 100\\,\\text{nM}$, $[L]_T = 150\\,\\text{nM}$, and the bound concentration $[PL] = 60\\,\\text{nM}$.\n\nThe concentration of free protein, $[P]$, is:\n$$[P] = [P]_T - [PL] = 100\\,\\text{nM} - 60\\,\\text{nM} = 40\\,\\text{nM}$$\nThe concentration of free ligand, $[L]$, is:\n$$[L] = [L]_T - [PL] = 150\\,\\text{nM} - 60\\,\\text{nM} = 90\\,\\text{nM}$$\nWith all equilibrium concentrations determined, we can calculate the exact dissociation constant, $K_{d,\\text{exact}}$:\n$$K_{d,\\text{exact}} = \\frac{[P][L]}{[PL]} = \\frac{(40\\,\\text{nM})(90\\,\\text{nM})}{60\\,\\text{nM}} = \\frac{3600}{60}\\,\\text{nM} = 60\\,\\text{nM}$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Naive Scatchard Estimate ($K_{d,\\text{naive}}$)**\n\nThe Scatchard equation relates the fractional saturation of the protein, $\\nu$, to the free ligand concentration $[L]$ and $K_d$. For a single binding site ($n=1$), the equation is:\n$$\\frac{\\nu}{[L]} = \\frac{1 - \\nu}{K_d}$$\nThe fractional saturation $\\nu$ is the ratio of bound protein sites to total protein concentration:\n$$\\nu = \\frac{[PL]}{[P]_T}$$\nThe problem demands a \"naive\" estimate based on the approximation that the free ligand concentration is equal to the total ligand concentration, i.e., $[L] \\approx [L]_T$. This is a flawed assumption when ligand depletion is significant, as it is in this case ($[PL]$ is $40\\%$ of $[L]_T$).\nApplying this approximation to the Scatchard equation gives:\n$$K_{d,\\text{naive}} = [L]_T \\frac{1 - \\nu}{\\nu}$$\nFirst, we calculate $\\nu$ from the given data:\n$$\\nu = \\frac{[PL]}{[P]_T} = \\frac{60\\,\\text{nM}}{100\\,\\text{nM}} = 0.6$$\nNow, we substitute the values for $\\nu$ and $[L]_T$ to find the naive estimate:\n$$K_{d,\\text{naive}} = (150\\,\\text{nM}) \\frac{1 - 0.6}{0.6} = (150\\,\\text{nM}) \\frac{0.4}{0.6} = (150\\,\\text{nM}) \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = 100\\,\\text{nM}$$\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of the Fold-Error**\n\nThe fold-error is the ratio of the exact to the naive $K_d$ values:\n$$\\text{Fold-error} = \\frac{K_{d,\\text{exact}}}{K_{d,\\text{naive}}} = \\frac{60\\,\\text{nM}}{100\\,\\text{nM}} = 0.6$$\nThe problem requires this result to be reported as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$0.6000$$\nThe significant discrepancy between $K_{d,\\text{exact}}$ and $K_{d,\\text{naive}}$ demonstrates the importance of using the exact mass-balance solution when ligand depletion is non-negligible, a common condition in high-affinity binding experiments.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6000}$$", "id": "2544781"}]}
