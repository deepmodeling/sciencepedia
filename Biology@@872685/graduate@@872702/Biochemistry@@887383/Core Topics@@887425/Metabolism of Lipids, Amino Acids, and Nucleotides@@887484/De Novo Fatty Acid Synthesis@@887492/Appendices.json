Start from the following foundational, well-established biochemical facts about de novo fatty acid synthesis:\n\n- Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) converts acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA using bicarbonate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This is the committed step for malonyl-CoA formation.\n- Fatty acid synthase (FAS) initiates with an acetyl group as a primer and then elongates the chain by iterative two-carbon additions derived from malonyl groups with decarboxylation at each condensation step, until palmitate is released by hydrolysis.\n- Each elongation cycle on FAS consists of a condensation, a reduction by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), a dehydration, and a second reduction by NADPH. Transacylation steps that load acyl groups onto the acyl carrier protein (ACP) release free coenzyme A (CoA-SH). The terminal thioesterase uses water to hydrolyze palmitoyl-ACP to free palmitate.\n\nUsing only mass balance, carbon balance, and redox balance implied by the statements above, derive the overall cytosolic reaction for palmitate synthesis in terms of the external metabolites acetyl-CoA, ATP, NADPH, palmitate, CoA-SH, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), inorganic phosphate ($P_i$), oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ($NADP^{+}$), and water.

Since each elongation cycle adds a $C_2$ unit derived from malonyl-CoA, a total of $14/2 = 7$ cycles of elongation are necessary.\n\nWe will now determine the stoichiometry for each stage of the process.\n\n**1. Synthesis of Malonyl-CoA**\nEach of the $7$ elongation cycles requires one molecule of malonyl-CoA. The formation of these $7$ molecules is catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Based on the provided information, the reaction is:\n$$ \\text{Acetyl-CoA} + \\text{HCO}_3^- + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{Malonyl-CoA} + \\text{ADP} + P_i $$\nTo produce the required $7$ molecules of malonyl-CoA, this reaction must proceed $7$ times.

Fatty Acid Synthase (FAS) Reaction Sequence**\nThe synthesis of one molecule of palmitate on the FAS complex can be broken down into initiation, elongation, and termination.\n\n- **Initiation**: One molecule of acetyl-CoA serves as the primer. Its acetyl group is loaded onto the FAS complex, releasing one molecule of CoA-SH.\n  - Reactant: $1$ Acetyl-CoA\n  - Product: $1$ CoA-SH\n\n- **Elongation**: There are $7$ cycles of elongation.\n  - For each cycle, one molecule of malonyl-CoA is used. Its malonyl group is loaded, releasing one CoA-SH. The subsequent condensation step is a decarboxylation, releasing one $CO_2$. The cycle involves two reduction steps, each consuming one NADPH, and one dehydration step, producing one $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$.\n  - Total for $7$ cycles:\n    - Reactants: $7$ Malonyl-CoA, $14$ NADPH ($2 \\times 7$)\n    - Products: $7$ CoA-SH, $7$ $CO_2$, $7$ $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$, $14$ $NADP^{+}$\n\n- **Termination**: The final $C_{16}$ chain (palmitoyl-ACP) is hydrolyzed to release free palmitate. This step consumes one molecule of water.\n  - Reactant: $1$ $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$\n  - Product: $1$ Palmitate\n\nSumming all steps within the FAS complex:\n- **Total Reactants for FAS**: $1$ Acetyl-CoA (primer) + $7$ Malonyl-CoA (elongation) + $14$ NADPH (reductions) + $1$ $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ (termination).\n- **Total Products for FAS**: $1$ Palmitate (termination) + $8$ CoA-SH ($1$ from primer + $7$ from elongation) + $7$ $CO_2$ (decarboxylation) + $7$ $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ (dehydration) + $14$ $NADP^{+}$ (reductions).\n\nThe net reaction for the FAS complex is:\n$$ 1\\ \\text{Acetyl-CoA} + 7\\ \\text{Malonyl-CoA} + 14\\ \\text{NADPH} + 1\\ \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow 1\\ \\text{Palmitate} + 8\\ \\text{CoA-SH} + 7\\ CO_2 + 7\\ \\text{H}_2\\text{O} + 14\\ \\text{NADP}^{+} $$\nWe can simplify the water molecules in this equation. There is $1$ $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ consumed and $7$ $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ produced, resulting in a net production of $6$ $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$.\n$$ 1\\ \\text{Acetyl-CoA} + 7\\ \\text{Malonyl-CoA} + 14\\ \\text{NADPH} \\rightarrow 1\\ \\text{Palmitate} + 8\\ \\text{CoA-SH} + 7\\ CO_2 + 6\\ \\text{H}_2\\text{O} + 14\\ \\text{NADP}^{+} \\quad (\\text{Equation 2}) $$\n\n**3. Overall Reaction for Palmitate Synthesis**\nTo obtain the overall reaction, we sum Equation 1 (malonyl-CoA synthesis) and Equation 2 (FAS reaction).\n\nEq. 1: $7\\ \\text{Acetyl-CoA} + 7\\ \\text{HCO}_3^- + 7\\ \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow 7\\ \\text{Malonyl-CoA} + 7\\ \\text{ADP} + 7\\ P_i$\nEq. 2: $1\\ \\text{Acetyl-CoA} + 7\\ \\text{Malonyl-CoA} + 14\\ \\text{NADPH} \\rightarrow 1\\ \\text{Palmitate} + 8\\ \\text{CoA-SH} + 7\\ CO_2 + 6\\ \\text{H}_2\\text{O} + 14\\ \\text{NADP}^{+}$\n\nSumming these two equations and canceling the intermediate species ($7$ Malonyl-CoA) yields:\n$$ (7+1)\\ \\text{Acetyl-CoA} + 7\\ \\text{HCO}_3^- + 7\\ \\text{ATP} + 14\\ \\text{NADPH} \\rightarrow 1\\ \\text{Palmitate} + 8\\ \\text{CoA-SH} + 7\\ CO_2 + (7\\ \\text{ADP} + 7\\ P_i) + 6\\ \\text{H}_2\\text{O} + 14\\ \\text{NADP}^{+} $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ 8\\ \\text{Acetyl-CoA} + 7\\ \\text{ATP} + 14\\ \\text{NADPH} + 7\\ \\text{HCO}_3^- \\rightarrow 1\\ \\text{Palmitate} + 8\\ \\text{CoA-SH} + 7\\ \\text{ADP} + 7\\ P_i + 14\\ \\text{NADP}^{+} + 6\\ \\text{H}_2\\text{O} + 7\\ CO_2 $$\n\n**4. Final Stoichiometry and Inorganic Carbon Balance**\nThe problem requires confirmation that the net consumption of inorganic carbon is zero. Our derived equation shows the consumption of $7$ molecules of bicarbonate ($\\text{HCO}_3^-$) and the production of $7$ molecules of carbon dioxide ($CO_2$). Thus, there is no net change in the total pool of inorganic carbon, confirming the statement.\n$$ 7\\ \\text{HCO}_3^- \\rightarrow 7\\ CO_2 $$\nAs these species cancel out in terms of net carbon flux and are not part of the final requested list of metabolites, they are omitted from the final net equation. The final overall reaction is:\n$$ 8\\ \\text{Acetyl-CoA} + 7\\ \\text{ATP} + 14\\ \\text{NADPH} \\rightarrow 1\\ \\text{Palmitate} + 8\\ \\text{CoA-SH} + 7\\ \\text{ADP} + 7\\ P_i + 14\\ \\text{NADP}^{+} + 6\\ \\text{H}_2\\text{O} $$\nThis equation represents the complete stoichiometry using the specified external metabolites. All coefficients are minimal positive integers.\n\n**5. Assembling the Final Answer Vector**\nThe stoichiometric coefficients for the species in the specified order (acetyl-CoA, ATP, NADPH, palmitate, CoA-SH, ADP, $P_i$, $NADP^{+}$, $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$) are extracted from the final balanced equation. Reactants are on the left side of the arrow and products are on the right side.

The FASN complex and its catalytic cycle are described accurately according to established biochemistry. The concept of creating a kinetic bottleneck by site-directed mutagenesis to reduce the $k_{\\text{cat}}$ of a single domain is a standard experimental strategy in enzymology and metabolic engineering. The reaction conditions (saturating substrates) simplify the kinetics to be dependent on the $V_{max}$ of the respective enzymatic steps. The problem is well-posed, asking for a predictable outcome of a defined perturbation based on principles of steady-state enzyme kinetics and metabolic flux. The language is objective and technical. All necessary information to logically deduce the outcome is provided. The scenario is experimentally feasible and does not violate any physical or chemical laws.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\nThe mammalian Type I Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN) operates as a multi-domain enzyme performing a cyclic four-step process to elongate a fatty acyl chain. Each elongation cycle adds two carbons derived from malonyl-CoA. The sequence of reactions per cycle, starting with an acyl-ACP of chain length $n$, is as follows:\n1.  **Ketoacyl Synthase (KS)**: $Acyl(C_n)\\text{-ACP} + \\text{Malonyl-ACP} \\rightarrow \\beta\\text{-Ketoacyl}(C_{n+2})\\text{-ACP} + CO_2 + \\text{ACP}$\n2.  **Ketoacyl Reductase (KR)**: $\\beta\\text{-Ketoacyl}(C_{n+2})\\text{-ACP} + \\text{NADPH} + H^+ \\rightarrow \\beta\\text{-Hydroxyacyl}(C_{n+2})\\text{-ACP} + \\text{NADP}^+$\n3.  **Dehydratase (DH)**: $\\beta\\text{-Hydroxyacyl}(C_{n+2})\\text{-ACP} \\rightleftharpoons trans\\text{-}2\\text{-Enoyl}(C_{n+2})\\text{-ACP} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}$\n4.  **Enoyl Reductase (ER)**: $trans\\text{-}2\\text{-Enoyl}(C_{n+2})\\text{-ACP} + \\text{NADPH} + H^+ \\rightarrow Acyl(C_{n+2})\\text{-ACP} + \\text{NADP}^+$\n\nThe newly formed saturated $Acyl(C_{n+2})\\text{-ACP}$ then serves as the substrate for the next round of elongation.\n\nThe problem states that the system is at steady state with saturating substrates, and the catalytic rate of the ER domain is reduced to $0.05$ times the wild-type rate. In a linear pathway at steady state, the overall flux is governed by the slowest, or rate-limiting, step. Since substrate concentrations are saturating, the velocity of each step, $v_i$, is approximately proportional to its $k_{\\text{cat},i}$. Given $k_{\\text{cat,ER}} = 0.05 \\times k_{\\text{cat,WT}}$ while all other $k_{\\text{cat}}$ values are near wild-type, the ER-catalyzed reaction is the primary kinetic bottleneck in every elongation cycle.\n\nAccording to the principles of metabolic control, when flux through a pathway is restricted at a particular step, the substrate for that enzymatic step will accumulate. The substrate for the ER domain is trans-$2$-enoyl-ACP. Therefore, the most dominant accumulating species will be trans-$2$-enoyl-ACP intermediates.\n\nFurthermore, the preceding reaction catalyzed by the DH domain is a dehydration, which is often reversible and operates near equilibrium. The law of mass action dictates that a significant increase in the concentration of the product, trans-$2$-enoyl-ACP, will shift the DH equilibrium backward, causing an accumulation of its substrate, $\\beta$-hydroxyacyl-ACP. Thus, we predict a major accumulation of trans-$2$-enoyl-ACP and a secondary, but significant, accumulation of $\\beta$-hydroxyacyl-ACP.\n\nThis bottleneck occurs in every cycle of elongation. Synthesis begins with a $C_2$ unit and proceeds by $C_2$ additions up to the point of termination, typically at $C_{16}$. Consequently, a spectrum of these intermediates with even-numbered chain lengths from $C_4$ to $C_{16}$ is expected to accumulate on the ACP domain. The production of the final saturated palmitoyl-ACP will be extremely slow, so it will not be the major accumulated species.\n\nFor the analytical workflow, the intermediates are covalently attached to the ACP domain via a phosphopantetheine linker. A valid method must be able to detect and identify these acyl-ACP species directly. Liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) on the intact or \"middle-down\" protein level is the state-of-the-art method for such a task. It allows separation of ACPs with different acyl chains and their unambiguous identification by mass. Fragmentation (MS/MS) can confirm the identity of both the protein (ACP) and the attached acyl group. A characteristic fragmentation of ACPs is the ejection of the phosphopantetheine arm, which can be used as a diagnostic signature.\n\nOrthogonal validation is critical. One kinetic validation is to measure NADPH consumption. A normal elongation cycle consumes $2$ molecules of NADPH: one at the KR step and one at the ER step. With the ER step effectively blocked, the cycle largely stops after the KR and DH steps. For every malonyl-CoA incorporated, only the KR step will consume NADPH at a significant rate. Therefore, the stoichiometry will shift from $2$ NADPH per elongation to approximately $1$ NADPH per elongation. A chemical validation for the enoyl group (a carbon-carbon double bond) can be achieved through a reaction that is specific to this functional group and results in a predictable mass shift. Conjugate reduction of the $\\alpha,\\beta$-unsaturated thioester by a deuterated reducing agent like sodium borodeuteride ($\\text{NaBD}_4$) is a plausible method, which would add two deuterium atoms ($^2H$) across the double bond, increasing the mass by $+2$ Da.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Predominant trans-$2$-enoyl-ACP intermediates spanning even chain lengths $C_4$–$C_{16}$, with minor pools of $3$-hydroxyacyl-ACP due to a near-equilibrated dehydratase step; detection by denaturing liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) of intact acyl carrier protein to quantify acyl-ACP species using phosphopantetheine ejection and accurate-mass discrimination of unsaturation, orthogonally validated by sodium borodeuteride treatment yielding a mass increase of $+2$ in enoyl-derived species and by monitoring a decrease in NADPH consumption toward $\\sim 1$ mol per elongation.**\n- **Intermediate Prediction**: This correctly identifies trans-$2$-enoyl-ACP as the primary accumulated species due to the ER bottleneck, and correctly infers the secondary accumulation of $\\beta$-hydroxyacyl-ACP ($3$-hydroxyacyl-ACP is an equivalent name) from the near-equilibrium nature of the DH step. It also correctly predicts a spectrum of chain lengths.\n- **Analytical Workflow**: This proposes the most suitable and rigorous method, intact protein LC–MS/MS, which directly interrogates the protein-bound state. The mention of phosphopantetheine ejection is a specific and correct detail for ACP mass spectrometry. The orthogonal validations are excellent: the change in NADPH stoichiometry is a powerful kinetic proof, and the use of $\\text{NaBD}_4$ to cause a $+2$ Da mass shift is a chemically specific way to confirm the presence of the enoyl double bond.\n- **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**B. Predominant $\\beta$-ketoacyl-ACP and malonyl-ACP intermediates centered at $C_6$–$C_{10}$ because upstream steps back up before dehydration; detection by base hydrolysis followed by gas chromatography of fatty acid methyl esters, which reports the accumulated species after quench.**\n- **Intermediate Prediction**: This is incorrect. The bottleneck is at ER, which is downstream of the KR step that consumes $\\beta$-ketoacyl-ACP. The KR step has wild-type kinetics and will rapidly convert $\\beta$-ketoacyl-ACP to $\\beta$-hydroxyacyl-ACP. Therefore, $\\beta$-ketoacyl-ACP concentrations should be low, not high. Malonyl-ACP accumulates only if the KS step is blocked.\n- **Analytical Workflow**: This method is destructive. Base hydrolysis followed by GC-FAME analysis loses information about the original functional group on the acyl chain ($\\beta$-keto, $\\beta$-hydroxy, or enoyl) and severs the link to the ACP, preventing analysis of the crucial protein-bound state. It is not specific and is inferior to LC-MS/MS.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**C. Accumulation of saturated palmitoyl-ACP and palmitoyl-CoA because the thioesterase continues to release product despite the ER defect; detection by acyl-coenzyme A profiling alone using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry of acyl-CoA thioesters.**\n- **Intermediate Prediction**: This is incorrect. The ER defect severely restricts the production of all saturated acyl-ACPs, including the final product precursor, palmitoyl-ACP. It will be formed at a very low rate and will not accumulate. Palmitoyl-CoA is not the direct product; the TE releases free palmitate, which must then be activated to palmitoyl-CoA by a different enzyme not part of the FASN complex.\n- **Analytical Workflow**: This method is completely misdirected. It proposes analyzing acyl-CoAs, but the accumulating intermediates are acyl-ACPs. This method would fail to detect the relevant species.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. Predominant trans-$2$-enoyl free fatty acids released from FASN due to weakened ER binding, detected by ultraviolet absorbance at $340$ nm without mass spectrometric characterization, since the conjugated enoyl thioester chromophore is sufficient for identification.**\n- **Intermediate Prediction**: This is incorrect. The intermediates are covalently attached to the ACP domain's phosphopantetheine arm. They are not released as free fatty acids. The thioesterase (TE) domain, which is responsible for product release, is highly specific for saturated chains (e.g., palmitoyl) and would not hydrolyze unsaturated intermediates.\n- **Analytical Workflow**: This is flawed. First, the species are not free fatty acids. Second, monitoring absorbance at $340$ nm is the standard method for tracking NADPH concentration. Using this wavelength to detect another species in a reaction that consumes NADPH would be impossible due to overwhelming interference. The characteristic UV absorbance maximum ($\\lambda_{max}$) for an enoyl thioester is in the range of $230-260$ nm, not $340$ nm. Relying on UV absorbance alone lacks the specificity to distinguish different chain lengths.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2554201"}, {"introduction": "This final practice elevates your perspective to the systems level, exploring how fatty acid synthesis integrates with central carbon metabolism.

There is no label scrambling in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle before citrate export.\n- Cytosolic acetyl-CoA is formed via two parallel sources: a fraction $f$ comes from mitochondrial citrate export and ACLY acting on citrate produced from PDH-derived acetyl-CoA, and a fraction $1-f$ comes from an unlabeled acetate source via acyl-CoA synthetase.

The problem is therefore valid, and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe objective is to determine the fraction of palmitate molecules that are fully labeled, denoted as $M+16$, meaning all $16$ of its carbon atoms are $^{13}\\text{C}$. This analysis begins with the synthesis of palmitate and the origin of its carbon atoms.\n\nPalmitate is a $16$-carbon saturated fatty acid. Its *de novo* synthesis is catalyzed by fatty acid synthase (FASN). The process requires two types of precursors derived from acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA): one molecule of acetyl-CoA serves as a primer, and seven molecules of malonyl-CoA serve as extender units. Each malonyl-CoA is synthesized from one molecule of acetyl-CoA and one molecule of bicarbonate by the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC).\n\nThe crucial step for carbon tracing is the condensation reaction within the FASN complex. For each of the seven elongation steps, a two-carbon unit is added to the growing acyl chain. This two-carbon unit originates from the acetyl portion of malonyl-CoA. The carboxyl group of malonyl-CoA, which was added from bicarbonate by ACC, is released as carbon dioxide ($CO_2$). Therefore, the carbon backbone of the final palmitate molecule is constructed exclusively from the two-carbon acetyl groups of the precursor CoA esters. Specifically, one acetyl-CoA molecule (the primer) and seven acetyl-CoA molecules (which were converted to malonyl-CoA) contribute their two-carbon units. In total, the $16$ carbons of palmitate are derived from $8$ distinct acetyl-CoA molecules.\n\nFor a palmitate molecule to be fully labeled, $M+16$, each of its $16$ carbons must be $^{13}\\text{C}$. Since each of the $8$ contributing acetyl-CoA units provides $2$ carbons to the palmitate backbone, this requires that all $8$ of these acetyl-CoA molecules must be the doubly-labeled isotopologue, $M+2$.\n\nThe problem states that the cytosolic pool of acetyl-CoA is supplied by two sources.\n$1$. A fraction, denoted by $f$, originates from mitochondrial citrate that has been exported to the cytosol and cleaved by ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY). This citrate is formed from PDH-derived acetyl-CoA, which in turn comes from uniformly labeled glucose. The problem explicitly states that acetyl-CoA from this route is $M+2$ (both carbons are $^{13}\\text{C}$).\n$2$. The remaining fraction, $1-f$, originates from an unlabeled acetate source. This acetyl-CoA is therefore $M+0$ (both carbons are $^{12}\\text{C}$).\n\nThe problem specifies that the cellular pools are large and homogeneous, allowing the selection of each of the $8$ acetyl-CoA molecules for palmitate synthesis to be treated as an independent and identically distributed random event. Let $P(\\text{M}+2)$ be the probability of selecting an $M+2$ acetyl-CoA molecule from the cytosolic pool, and $P(\\text{M}+0)$ be the probability of selecting an $M+0$ molecule. Based on the fractional contributions of the two sources, we have:\n$$P(\\text{M}+2) = f$$\n$$P(\\text{M}+0) = 1-f$$\n\nFor a single molecule of palmitate to be fully labeled ($M+16$), all $8$ of the acetyl-CoA molecules incorporated into its structure must be of the $M+2$ type. Since the selections are independent events, the probability of this specific outcome is the product of the probabilities of each individual selection.\n\nLet $F_{\\text{M}+16}$ be the fraction of palmitate that is fully labeled. This fraction is equivalent to the probability that a randomly synthesized palmitate molecule is $M+16$.\n$$F_{\\text{M}+16} = P(\\text{1st is M+2}) \\times P(\\text{2nd is M+2}) \\times \\dots \\times P(\\text{8th is M+2})$$\n$$F_{\\text{M}+16} = [P(\\text{M}+2)]^8$$\nSubstituting the probability in terms of $f$, we derive the expression for the fraction of $M+16$ palmitate:\n$$F_{\\text{M}+16} = f^8$$\n\nThis is the general expression for the fraction of fully labeled palmitate in terms of $f$.\n\nThe second part of the task is to evaluate this expression for the specific case where $f = 0.80$.\n$$F_{\\text{M}+16} = (0.80)^8$$\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$(0.80)^2 = 0.64$$\n$$(0.80)^4 = (0.64)^2 = 0.4096$$\n$$(0.80)^8 = (0.4096)^2 = 0.16777216$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $6$, $7$, $7$. The fifth significant figure is $7$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$F_{\\text{M}+16} \\approx 0.1678$$\n\nThus, when $80\\%$ of the cytosolic acetyl-CoA is derived from the labeled glucose source, approximately $16.78\\%$ of the newly synthesized palmitate will be fully labeled.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.1678}\n$$", "id": "2554309"}]}
