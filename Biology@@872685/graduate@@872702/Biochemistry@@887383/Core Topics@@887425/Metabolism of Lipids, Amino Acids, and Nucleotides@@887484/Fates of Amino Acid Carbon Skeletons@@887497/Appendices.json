The following foundational facts are known and can be assumed as the starting point: amino acids classified as ketogenic are those whose carbon skeleton yields acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) or acetoacetate, and amino acids classified as glucogenic are those whose carbon skeleton yields pyruvate or tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates such as oxaloacetate, $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate, succinyl-CoA, or fumarate; carbon is conserved in reactions except where explicitly released as carbon dioxide; and the biotin-dependent propionyl-CoA carboxylase reaction incorporates bicarbonate-derived carbon into the product.\n\nMass spectrometric analysis of isoleucine catabolism shows that the carbon skeleton of one molecule of isoleucine, which contains $6$ carbons, is converted under these conditions into $1$ mole of acetyl-CoA (containing $2$ carbons) and $1$ mole of propionyl-CoA (containing $3$ carbons), with the remaining $1$ carbon released as carbon dioxide during oxidative decarboxylation of the corresponding $\\alpha$-keto acid. Propionyl-CoA is subsequently converted to succinyl-CoA by the sequential actions of propionyl-CoA carboxylase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase; the carboxylase step incorporates $1$ carbon from bicarbonate, so that only the carbons originally present in propionyl-CoA derive from isoleucine.\n\nUsing only the facts stated above and conservation of mass, determine the fraction of carbons from one molecule of isoleucine that are ketogenic and the fraction that are glucogenic, where “ketogenic” refers to those carbons that become acetyl-CoA and “glucogenic” refers to those carbons that become tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates capable of net glucose production via gluconeogenesis (here, via succinyl-CoA derived from propionyl-CoA without counting the bicarbonate-derived carbon).

It presents a standard biochemical problem based on established metabolic pathways. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the determination of the ketogenic and glucogenic fractions of carbons originating from one molecule of isoleucine.\n\nFirst, we establish the total number of carbons in the starting molecule. Isoleucine is stated to contain $N_{total} = 6$ carbon atoms.\n\nThe catabolism of isoleucine is described, yielding three products from its carbon skeleton:\n$1$. One molecule of acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which is stated to contain $N_{acetyl} = 2$ carbons derived from isoleucine.\n$2$. One molecule of propionyl-coenzyme A (propionyl-CoA), which contains $N_{propionyl} = 3$ carbons derived from isoleucine.\n$3$. One molecule of carbon dioxide ($CO_2$), which accounts for the remaining $N_{CO_2} = 1$ carbon atom.\n\nWe verify the conservation of carbon atoms. The sum of carbons in the products is $N_{acetyl} + N_{propionyl} + N_{CO_2} = 2 + 3 + 1 = 6$. This is equal to the total number of carbons in the initial isoleucine molecule, $N_{total} = 6$, confirming the consistency of the provided data.\n\nNext, we apply the specific definitions of \"ketogenic\" and \"glucogenic\" as provided in the problem statement.\n\nThe ketogenic fraction, $k$, corresponds to the carbons that become acetyl-CoA. The number of these carbons is given as $N_k = N_{acetyl} = 2$. The fraction is calculated relative to the total number of carbons in isoleucine:\n$$k = \\frac{N_k}{N_{total}} = \\frac{2}{6}$$\nReducing this fraction to its simplest form gives:\n$$k = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nThe glucogenic fraction, $g$, corresponds to the carbons that become tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates. The problem specifies that propionyl-CoA is converted to the TCA cycle intermediate succinyl-CoA. Crucially, it is stated that although the enzymatic conversion of propionyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA involves the incorporation of $1$ carbon atom from bicarbonate ($HCO_3^-$), only the carbons originally present in propionyl-CoA should be counted as glucogenic. Therefore, the number of glucogenic carbons, $N_g$, is the number of carbons in the propionyl-CoA precursor derived from isoleucine. This number is given as $N_g = N_{propionyl} = 3$. The fraction is then:\n$$g = \\frac{N_g}{N_{total}} = \\frac{3}{6}$$\nReducing this fraction to its simplest form gives:\n$$g = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be presented as a row vector $[k \\ g]$. Substituting the calculated fractions, we have the vector $[\\frac{1}{3} \\ \\frac{1}{2}]$. These fractions represent the portions of the original $6$-carbon skeleton of isoleucine that are committed to ketogenic and glucogenic fates, respectively. The remaining carbon, constituting a fraction of $\\frac{1}{6}$, is lost as $CO_2$ and is neither ketogenic nor glucogenic. The sum of the fractions is $\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{2}{6} + \\frac{3}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{6}{6} = 1$, accounting for all carbons from the original molecule.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2562938"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple classification, a quantitative understanding of metabolism requires you to calculate the energetic yield from the complete oxidation of fuel molecules.
