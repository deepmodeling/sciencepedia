Build the overall stoichiometric equation for this pathway starting from the following foundational biochemical facts and principles:\n\n- Conservation of mass and charge applies to biochemical reactions at steady state, so atoms and net charge must balance when elementary steps are combined.\n- The first committed step is a reductive saturation of the $\\mathrm{C}5\\text{–}\\mathrm{C}6$ double bond of uracil catalyzed by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase. This reaction uses nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP$^+$) in its reduced form (NADPH) as a two-electron hydride donor; it is standard to represent this hydride transfer stoichiometrically as consumption of $1$ $\\mathrm{NADPH}$ and $1$ $\\mathrm{H}^+$ to add two hydrogen atoms to the ring, producing $\\mathrm{NADP}^+$.\n- The subsequent two enzymatic steps are hydrolyses: ring opening by dihydropyrimidinase and ureido cleavage by $\\beta$-ureidopropionase, each consuming $1$ molecule of $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ and releasing no redox cofactors.\n\nUse the following elemental formulas for small molecules to check and enforce atomic balance: uracil $\\left(\\mathrm{C}_4\\mathrm{H}_4\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_2\\right)$, $\\beta$-alanine $\\left(\\mathrm{C}_3\\mathrm{H}_7\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{O}_2\\right)$, ammonia $\\left(\\mathrm{NH_3}\\right)$, carbon dioxide $\\left(\\mathrm{CO_2}\\right)$, and water $\\left(\\mathrm{H_2O}\\right)$.

The task is to construct the overall stoichiometric equation for uracil catabolism from its elementary steps, a standard procedure in chemical kinetics and metabolic analysis. The principle of conservation of mass, which dictates that atoms must balance in any chemical transformation, is the fundamental tool for this derivation.\n\nThe overall pathway is described as a sequence of three enzymatic reactions. We will write the balanced equation for each step and then sum them algebraically to find the net reaction, canceling any species that appear as both a product in one step and a reactant in a subsequent step (i.e., intermediates).\n\nThe initial substrate is uracil, with the given formula $\\mathrm{C}_4\\mathrm{H}_4\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_2$.\n\nStep $1$: Reductive saturation catalyzed by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase. This step consumes $1$ molecule of uracil, $1$ molecule of $\\mathrm{NADPH}$, and $1$ proton ($\\mathrm{H}^+$) to produce $1$ molecule of $\\mathrm{NADP}^+$ and the reduced intermediate, dihydrouracil. The reaction is specified as adding two hydrogen atoms to the uracil ring. Therefore, the formula for dihydrouracil must be $\\mathrm{C}_4\\mathrm{H}_6\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_2$. The balanced equation for this step is:\n$$ \\mathrm{C}_4\\mathrm{H}_4\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_2 \\text{ (uracil)} + \\mathrm{NADPH} + \\mathrm{H}^+ \\rightarrow \\mathrm{C}_4\\mathrm{H}_6\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_2 \\text{ (dihydrouracil)} + \\mathrm{NADP}^+ $$\n\nStep $2$: Ring-opening hydrolysis of dihydrouracil by dihydropyrimidinase. This step consumes $1$ molecule of dihydrouracil and $1$ molecule of water ($\\mathrm{H_2O}$) to form the second intermediate, N-carbamoyl-$\\beta$-alanine. By balancing the atoms from the reactants, the formula for N-carbamoyl-$\\beta$-alanine is determined.\nReactants: $\\mathrm{C}_4\\mathrm{H}_6\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_2 + \\mathrm{H_2O} \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{C}_4\\mathrm{H}_{6+2}\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_{2+1} = \\mathrm{C}_4\\mathrm{H}_8\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$.\nThe reaction is:\n$$ \\mathrm{C}_4\\mathrm{H}_6\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_2 \\text{ (dihydrouracil)} + \\mathrm{H_2O} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{C}_4\\mathrm{H}_8\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_3 \\text{ (N-carbamoyl-$\\beta$-alanine)} $$\n\nStep $3$: Ureido cleavage by $\\beta$-ureidopropionase. The problem states this is a hydrolysis consuming $1$ additional molecule of $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ to break down N-carbamoyl-$\\beta$-alanine into the final products: $\\beta$-alanine ($\\mathrm{C}_3\\mathrm{H}_7\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{O}_2$), carbon dioxide ($\\mathrm{CO_2}$), and ammonia ($\\mathrm{NH_3}$). We must verify the atom balance for this step using the provided formulas.\nReactants: $\\mathrm{C}_4\\mathrm{H}_8\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_3 + \\mathrm{H_2O} = \\mathrm{C}_4\\mathrm{H}_{10}\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_4$.\nProducts: $\\mathrm{C}_3\\mathrm{H}_7\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{O}_2 + \\mathrm{CO_2} + \\mathrm{NH_3} = \\mathrm{C}_{3+1}\\mathrm{H}_{7+3}\\mathrm{N}_{1+1}\\mathrm{O}_{2+2} = \\mathrm{C}_4\\mathrm{H}_{10}\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_4$.\nThe atomic balance is confirmed. The equation for this step is:\n$$ \\mathrm{C}_4\\mathrm{H}_8\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_3 \\text{ (N-carbamoyl-$\\beta$-alanine)} + \\mathrm{H_2O} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{C}_3\\mathrm{H}_7\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{O}_2 \\text{ ($\\beta$-alanine)} + \\mathrm{CO_2} + \\mathrm{NH_3} $$\n\nTo obtain the overall stoichiometric equation, we sum the three elementary steps and cancel the intermediates (dihydrouracil and N-carbamoyl-$\\beta$-alanine), which appear on both sides of the reaction arrow. Summing the reactions and canceling intermediates yields the net equation by combining a total of $2$ molecules of $\\mathrm{H_2O}$. The net reaction is:\n$$ \\mathrm{C}_4\\mathrm{H}_4\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_2 \\text{ (uracil)} + \\mathrm{NADPH} + \\mathrm{H}^+ + 2 \\, \\mathrm{H_2O} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{C}_3\\mathrm{H}_7\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{O}_2 \\text{ ($\\beta$-alanine)} + \\mathrm{CO_2} + \\mathrm{NH_3} + \\mathrm{NADP}^+ $$\nThe problem asks for the NADPH cost per mole of uracil degraded. From the derived net stoichiometric equation, we see that the degradation of $1$ mole of uracil requires the consumption of $1$ mole of NADPH. Therefore, the cost, expressed as a pure number, is the ratio of the stoichiometric coefficients: $\\frac{1 \\text{ mole } \\mathrm{NADPH}}{1 \\text{ mole } \\mathrm{uracil}}$.\n\nThe NADPH cost per mole of uracil is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2595309"}, {"introduction": "Building on the products of nucleotide degradation, this problem shifts focus to the physiological regulation of urate, the final product of purine catabolism in humans.

However, it contains a significant terminological imprecision. The term \"net reabsorptive flux\" is ambiguous. In standard physiological context, a net flux across the tubular epithelium is the difference between total reabsorption and total secretion. If we let $L_f$ be the filtered load, $J_{reab}$ be total reabsorption, and $J_{sec}$ be total secretion, this interpretation would mean $J_{reab} - J_{sec} = 0.90 L_f$. Given that $J_{sec} = 0.10 L_f$, this would imply $J_{reab} = 1.00 L_f$. This contradicts the problem's subsequent statement that the components of reabsorption are $0.70 L_f$ (from URAT1) and $0.20 L_f$ (from other transporters), which sum to $0.90 L_f$.\n\nTo resolve this contradiction, one must posit that the problem's author has used the term \"net reabsorptive flux\" incorrectly to mean \"total reabsorptive flux\". Under this assumption, $J_{reab} = 0.90 L_f$, which is perfectly consistent with its stated components ($0.70 L_f + 0.20 L_f = 0.90 L_f$). While such imprecision is undesirable, this interpretation renders the problem logically coherent and solvable. Therefore, I will proceed by adopting this interpretation. The problem is thus deemed valid, albeit poorly formulated.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe fundamental equation for the amount of a substance excreted, $L_{ex}$, is given by the balance of filtration, reabsorption, and secretion:\n$$L_{ex} = L_f - J_{reab} + J_{sec}$$\nwhere $L_f$ is the filtered load, $J_{reab}$ is the total reabsorptive flux, and $J_{sec}$ is the total secretory flux.\n\nThe fractional excretion, $\\mathrm{FE}$, is the ratio of the amount excreted to the amount filtered:\n$$\\mathrm{FE} = \\frac{L_{ex}}{L_f} = \\frac{L_f - J_{reab} + J_{sec}}{L_f} = 1 - \\frac{J_{reab}}{L_f} + \\frac{J_{sec}}{L_f}$$\nThe absolute values for $[U]_p$ and GFR are not necessary for this calculation, as $\\mathrm{FE}$ is a dimensionless ratio.\n\n**Part 1: Baseline Fractional Excretion ($\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{baseline}}$)**\n\nUnder baseline conditions, the fluxes are given as fractions of the filtered load $L_f$:\n-   Total reabsorptive flux: $J_{reab} = 0.90 L_f$. This is composed of $J_{\\text{URAT1}} = 0.70 L_f$ and $J_{\\text{other}} = 0.20 L_f$.\n-   Total secretory flux: $J_{sec} = 0.10 L_f$.\n\nWe can now compute the baseline fractional excretion, $\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{baseline}}$:\n$$\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{baseline}} = 1 - \\frac{J_{reab}}{L_f} + \\frac{J_{sec}}{L_f} = 1 - 0.90 + 0.10$$\n$$\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{baseline}} = 0.20$$\n\n**Part 2: Fractional Excretion after Probenecid Therapy ($\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{probenecid}}$)**\n\nProbenecid competitively inhibits the URAT1 transporter. The activity of URAT1 is reduced by a factor $f_A$, given by the competitive inhibition formula:\n$$f_A = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}}$$\nUsing the provided values, $[I] = 120\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $K_i = 30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$:\n$$\\frac{[I]}{K_i} = \\frac{120}{30} = 4$$\nThe fractional activity of URAT1 is therefore:\n$$f_A = \\frac{1}{1 + 4} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.20$$\nThe new reabsorptive flux via URAT1, denoted $J'_{\\text{URAT1}}$, is the baseline flux reduced by this factor:\n$$J'_{\\text{URAT1}} = J_{\\text{URAT1}} \\times f_A = (0.70 L_f) \\times 0.20 = 0.14 L_f$$\nThe problem states that other transporters are unaffected.

The solution is derived from first principles of steady-state mass balance.\n\nFirst, we derive the required expressions for the concentrations.\n\n1.  Derivation of steady-state serum urate concentration, $C_{\\text{urate}}(f,g)$.\nAt steady state, the rate of urate appearance in the serum equals its rate of elimination. The rate of urate production is the fraction of the total purine degradation flux, $F_{p}$, that is not inhibited from forming urate. This fraction is $(1-f)$. Thus, the urate input rate is $F_{p}(1-f)$.\nThe systemic clearance of urate, $Cl_{u}$, is initially given as $Cl_{u,0}$ and is enhanced by a multiplicative factor $g$ due to the URAT1 inhibitor. Therefore, the total urate clearance is $Cl_{u} = Cl_{u,0}g$.\nAccording to the principle of steady-state mass balance, concentration equals the input rate divided by clearance.\n$$C_{\\text{urate}}(f,g) = \\frac{\\text{Urate Input Rate}}{\\text{Urate Clearance}} = \\frac{F_{p}(1-f)}{Cl_{u,0}g}$$\n\n2.  Derivation of urinary xanthine concentration, $C_{\\text{u,xan}}(f)$.\nXO inhibition diverts a fraction $f$ of the purine degradation flux $F_{p}$ to xanthine and hypoxanthine. Assuming these precursors are fully excreted via the kidneys, the daily mass of xanthine excreted is $F_{p}f$.\nThe urinary concentration is this daily mass divided by the daily urine volume, $V_{u}$.\n$$C_{\\text{u,xan}}(f) = \\frac{\\text{Daily Xanthine Excretion}}{\\text{Daily Urine Volume}} = \\frac{F_{p}f}{V_{u}}$$\n\nWith these expressions, we proceed to solve the optimization problem. The objective is to find the dose $D^{\\ast}$ that corresponds to the minimal fractional inhibition $f$ that satisfies two constraints:\n(i) $C_{\\text{urate}}(f,g) \\leq C_{t}$\n(ii) $C_{\\text{u,xan}}(f) \\leq C_{\\text{u,xan,max}}$, where $C_{\\text{u,xan,max}} = 250$ mg/L.\n\nThe problem specifies fixed values for several parameters:\n- Purine degradation flux: $F_{p} = 600$ mg/day.\n- Baseline urate clearance: $Cl_{u,0} = 6.0$ L/day.\n- Uricosuric enhancement factor: $g = 1.3$.\n- Target serum urate concentration: $C_{t} = 6$ mg/dL. We must convert this to mg/L. Since $1$ dL = $0.1$ L, $C_{t} = 60$ mg/L.\n- Daily urine volume: $V_{u} = 1.5$ L/day.\n- XO inhibitor potency: $ED_{50} = 400$ mg.\n\nWe analyze the constraints in terms of $f$. Since $C_{\\text{u,xan}}(f)$ is a strictly increasing function of $f$, minimizing nephrolithiasis risk is equivalent to minimizing $f$. We must therefore find the minimum value of $f$ that satisfies both constraints.\n\nConstraint (i): $\\frac{F_{p}(1-f)}{Cl_{u,0}g} \\leq C_{t}$.\nSince we seek the minimal $f$, we solve for the boundary condition where the inequality becomes an equality.
