Consider the canonical four-step $\\beta$-oxidation spiral occurring in the mitochondrial matrix for saturated substrates: first dehydrogenation (forming one reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide, FADH$_{2}$), hydration, second dehydrogenation (forming one reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, NADH), and thiolytic cleavage by coenzyme A (CoA).

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained, permitting a formal derivation from the provided foundational principles. We shall now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive expressions for four quantities related to the complete $\\beta$-oxidation of an even-chain saturated fatty acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) with a carbon length of $n$, where $n$ is an even integer such that $n \\geq 4$. The quantities are: $C(n)$, the number of spiral turns; $N(n)$, the total NADH produced; $F(n)$, the total FADH$_{2}$ produced; and $A(n)$, the total acetyl-CoA produced. The derivation will be based exclusively on the facts provided.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for $A(n)$, the total number of acetyl-CoA molecules formed. The process described is the complete conversion of an $n$-carbon chain into acetyl-CoA molecules. Acetyl-CoA is a $2$-carbon molecule. According to the principle of conservation of mass, specifically the conservation of carbon atoms, all carbons from the initial $n$-carbon acyl-CoA must be accounted for in the final products. Since acetyl-CoA is the sole carbon-containing product of the spiral itself, we can write the following balance equation:\n$$ n = A(n) \\times 2 $$\nwhere $n$ is the total number of carbons in the initial substrate and $A(n) \\times 2$ is the total number of carbons in the resulting acetyl-CoA molecules. Solving for $A(n)$ yields:\n$$ A(n) = \\frac{n}{2} $$\nThis expression is valid because $n$ is defined as an even integer, ensuring that $A(n)$ is always an integer.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for $C(n)$, the total number of turns of the $\\beta$-oxidation spiral. Each turn of the spiral involves a thiolytic cleavage that releases one molecule of acetyl-CoA and shortens the acyl-CoA chain by $2$ carbons. This process can be conceptualized as sequentially breaking an $n$-carbon chain into $\\frac{n}{2}$ two-carbon units. To sever a linear chain of $k$ linked objects into its constituent components, one must perform $k-1$ cuts. In this biochemical context, each \"cut\" is a thiolytic cleavage, which corresponds to one turn of the spiral. The number of $2$-carbon units to be produced is $k = A(n) = \\frac{n}{2}$.\nTherefore, the number of cleavages, or turns $C(n)$, is given by:\n$$ C(n) = k - 1 = A(n) - 1 $$\nSubstituting the previously derived expression for $A(n)$:\n$$ C(n) = \\frac{n}{2} - 1 $$\nLet us verify this logic. The process terminates when the remaining acyl-CoA is a $4$-carbon chain (butyryl-CoA). This final substrate undergoes one last turn of the spiral to yield two molecules of acetyl-CoA. A chain of length $n$ requires a total of $\\frac{n-4}{2}$ cycles to be shortened to a $4$-carbon chain. The final cycle on the $4$-carbon chain brings the total to $(\\frac{n-4}{2}) + 1 = \\frac{n}{2} - 2 + 1 = \\frac{n}{2} - 1$. The reasoning is consistent.\n\nFinally, we derive the expressions for $N(n)$ and $F(n)$, the total number of NADH and FADH$_{2}$ molecules formed. The problem statement provides a crucial fact: \"Each turn of the $\\beta$-oxidation spiral ... yields exactly one molecule each of FADH$_{2}$ and NADH.\" This establishes a direct stoichiometric relationship between the number of spiral turns and the production of these reduced coenzymes.\nFor each of the $C(n)$ turns, one molecule of NADH is produced. Thus, the total number of NADH molecules is:\n$$ N(n) = 1 \\times C(n) = C(n) $$\nSimilarly, for each of the $C(n)$ turns, one molecule of FADH$_{2}$ is produced. Thus, the total number of FADH$_{2}$ molecules is:\n$$ F(n) = 1 \\times C(n) = C(n) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $C(n)$ into these relationships, we obtain:\n$$ N(n) = \\frac{n}{2} - 1 $$\n$$ F(n) = \\frac{n}{2} - 1 $$\n\nIn summary, the derived expressions are:\n- Total number of spiral turns: $C(n) = \\frac{n}{2} - 1$\n- Total number of NADH molecules: $N(n) = \\frac{n}{2} - 1$\n- Total number of FADH$_{2}$ molecules: $F(n) = \\frac{n}{2} - 1$\n- Total number of acetyl-CoA molecules: $A(n) = \\frac{n}{2}$\n\nThese expressions are presented in the required order.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{n}{2} - 1 & \\frac{n}{2} - 1 & \\frac{n}{2} - 1 & \\frac{n}{2} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2616503"}, {"introduction": "With the stoichiometric rules established, we can now address a central question in bioenergetics: what is the total energy yield from fatty acid catabolism?

The complete aerobic oxidation of palmitate ($\\mathrm{C}_{16}\\!:\\!0$) will be analyzed in sequential stages: activation, $\\beta$-oxidation, citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation.\n\n**Stage 1: Activation of Palmitate**\nThe initial step is the activation of the free fatty acid palmitate into its metabolically active form, palmitoyl–CoA. The problem states this process consumes energy equivalent to $2$ molecules of $\\mathrm{ATP}$. This represents an initial energy investment.\nCost of activation $= -2$ $\\mathrm{ATP}$ equivalents.\n\n**Stage 2: β-Oxidation of Palmitoyl–CoA**\nPalmitoyl–CoA has a $16$-carbon acyl chain. The goal of $\\beta$-oxidation is to cleave this chain into $2$-carbon acetyl–CoA units. We must determine the number of cycles required and the total yield of reducing equivalents and acetyl–CoA.\nFor a fatty acid with $n$ carbon atoms, the number of acetyl–CoA units produced is $n/2$. For palmitate, $n=16$, so the number of acetyl–CoA molecules is $16/2 = 8$.\nThe number of $\\beta$-oxidation cycles required for a saturated, even-chain fatty acid is $(n/2) - 1$. For palmitate, this is $(16/2) - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7$ cycles.\nThis is consistent with the provided description: $6$ cycles each release one acetyl–CoA, leaving a $4$-carbon acyl–CoA (butyryl–CoA). The $7^{th}$ and final cycle cleaves this $4$-carbon unit into two acetyl–CoA molecules. In total, $6 + 2 = 8$ acetyl–CoA molecules are produced over $7$ cycles.\nAccording to the problem, each of the $7$ cycles yields $1$ $\\mathrm{NADH}$ and $1$ $\\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$.\nTherefore, the total yield from the $\\beta$-oxidation of one molecule of palmitoyl–CoA is:\n- Acetyl–CoA: $8$ molecules\n- $\\mathrm{NADH}$: $7 \\times 1 = 7$ molecules\n- $\\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$: $7 \\times 1 = 7$ molecules\n\n**Stage 3: Citric Acid Cycle (TCA Cycle)**\nThe $8$ molecules of acetyl–CoA produced in Stage 2 now enter the citric acid cycle for complete oxidation to $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.
