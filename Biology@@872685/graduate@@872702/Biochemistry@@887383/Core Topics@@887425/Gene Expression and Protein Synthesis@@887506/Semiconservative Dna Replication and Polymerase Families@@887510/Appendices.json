The cells then undergo synchronous rounds of genome duplication with a generation time that exactly equals the time to complete one round of DNA replication.

It presents a simplified but fundamentally correct kinetic model of a real biochemical process—the competition between nucleotide extension and proofreading excision by a DNA polymerase. The assumptions are clearly stated, and the provided data are sufficient and consistent for a unique solution. Therefore, we proceed.\n\nThe task is divided into two parts: first, to derive an analytical expression for the probability of mismatch fixation, $P_{\\mathrm{fix}}$; second, to compute this probability for several specific cases.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of $P_{\\mathrm{fix}}$\n\nWe are given a system in a state where a mismatched nucleotide has been incorporated at the $3^{\\prime}$ primer terminus. From this state, two independent, mutually exclusive first-order processes can occur:\n1. Extension: with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{ext}}$.\n2. Excision (proofreading): with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{exo}}$.\n\nThe problem states that these processes are memoryless. This is the defining characteristic of a Poisson process, which implies that the waiting time for each event follows an exponential distribution. Let $T_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ be the random variable representing the time until extension occurs, and $T_{\\mathrm{exo}}$ be the time until excision occurs.\n\nThe probability density function (PDF) for an exponential distribution with rate parameter $\\lambda$ is $f(t) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda t)$ for $t \\ge 0$.\nThus, the PDF for $T_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ is $f_{\\mathrm{ext}}(t) = k_{\\mathrm{ext}} \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{ext}} t)$, and the PDF for $T_{\\mathrm{exo}}$ is $f_{\\mathrm{exo}}(t) = k_{\\mathrm{exo}} \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{exo}} t)$.\n\nThe probability of mismatch fixation, $P_{\\mathrm{fix}}$, is the probability that the extension event occurs before the excision event, i.e., $P_{\\mathrm{fix}} = P(T_{\\mathrm{ext}} < T_{\\mathrm{exo}})$.\n\nA direct and fundamental way to solve for this probability is to consider the total rate of any event occurring. Since the two pathways are independent, the total rate at which the initial state is resolved is the sum of the individual rates:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{total}} = k_{\\mathrm{ext}} + k_{\\mathrm{exo}}\n$$\nThis total rate, $k_{\\mathrm{total}}$, determines the probability that *any* event occurs in an infinitesimal time interval $dt$, which is $k_{\\mathrm{total}} dt$. The phenomena of extension and excision are in a race. The probability that the event that wins this race is extension is simply the ratio of its rate to the total rate of all competing events.\n\nThis is a general principle for competing, independent first-order processes. The probability of pathway $i$ occurring first from a set of $N$ competing pathways is given by $P_i = k_i / \\sum_{j=1}^{N} k_j$.\n\nIn our case, there are two competing pathways. Therefore, the probability that extension occurs before excision is:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{fix}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{ext}}}{k_{\\mathrm{ext}} + k_{\\mathrm{exo}}}\n$$\nThis expression is the required analytic result. It is dimensionless, as required for a probability, since the units of the rate constants in the numerator and denominator cancel.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of $P_{\\mathrm{fix}}$\n\nWe now apply this formula to the given numerical data for DNA polymerase $\\varepsilon$ (Pol $\\varepsilon$) and DNA polymerase $\\delta$ (Pol $\\delta$).

The roles assigned to polymerases Pol $\\varepsilon$, Pol $\\delta$, and Pol $\\alpha$, and the sequential action of proofreading and MMR, are consistent with established biochemical principles. The provided numerical parameters for error rates and repair efficiencies are well within realistic biological ranges. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and clear assumptions to calculate a unique, meaningful solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution is warranted.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe objective is to compute the total expected number of base substitutions, $E_{\\text{total}}$, in one newly synthesized strand of length $L$. This total is the sum of substitutions arising from synthesis by each of the three DNA polymerases: Pol $\\varepsilon$, Pol $\\delta$, and Pol $\\alpha$.\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = E_{\\varepsilon} + E_{\\delta} + E_{\\alpha}$$\nThe expected number of mutations from a given polymerase is the product of the length of DNA it synthesizes and its final error rate per base.\n\nFirst, we calculate the final error rate, $r_{\\text{final}}$, for each polymerase. The error correction processes act sequentially. An initial misincorporation at rate $r_0$ is subject to proofreading (if present) with efficiency $p_{\\text{proof}}$, and any remaining errors are subject to MMR with efficiency $p_{\\mathrm{MMR}}$. The final error rate is thus:\n$$r_{\\text{final}} = r_{0} \\times (1 - p_{\\text{proof}}) \\times (1 - p_{\\mathrm{MMR}})$$\n\n- For Pol $\\varepsilon$:\n$r_{\\varepsilon, \\text{final}} = r_{\\varepsilon,0} \\times (1 - p_{\\varepsilon}) \\times (1 - p_{\\mathrm{MMR}})$\n$r_{\\varepsilon, \\text{final}} = (2 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (1 - 0.995) \\times (1 - 0.999) = (2 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (5 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (1 \\times 10^{-3}) = 1 \\times 10^{-11}$.\n\n- For Pol $\\delta$:\n$r_{\\delta, \\text{final}} = r_{\\delta,0} \\times (1 - p_{\\delta}) \\times (1 - p_{\\mathrm{MMR}})$\n$r_{\\delta, \\text{final}} = (4 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (1 - 0.998) \\times (1 - 0.999) = (4 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (1 \\times 10^{-3}) = 8 \\times 10^{-12}$.\n\n- For Pol $\\alpha$:\n$p_{\\alpha} = 0$ as it lacks proofreading.\n$r_{\\alpha, \\text{final}} = r_{\\alpha,0} \\times (1 - p_{\\alpha}) \\times (1 - p_{\\mathrm{MMR}})$\n$r_{\\alpha, \\text{final}} = (1 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times (1 - 0) \\times (1 - 0.999) = (1 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times 1 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-3}) = 1 \\times 10^{-8}$.\n\nNext, we determine the length of DNA synthesized by each polymerase. The total length of the new strand is $L = 1.2 \\times 10^{7}$ bp. Replication forks progress such that half of this length is synthesized as the leading strand and half as the lagging strand.\n\n- Leading Strand (Pol $\\varepsilon$):\nThe length synthesized by Pol $\\varepsilon$ is $L_{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{L}{2} = \\frac{1.2 \\times 10^{7}}{2} = 6 \\times 10^{6}$ bp.\nThe expected number of mutations from Pol $\\varepsilon$ is:\n$E_{\\varepsilon} = L_{\\varepsilon} \\times r_{\\varepsilon, \\text{final}} = (6 \\times 10^{6}) \\times (1 \\times 10^{-11}) = 6 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n\n- Lagging Strand (Pol $\\alpha$ and Pol $\\delta$):\nThe total length of the lagging strand is $L_{\\text{lag}} = \\frac{L}{2} = 6 \\times 10^{6}$ bp.\nThis strand is composed of Okazaki fragments. The number of fragments is:\n$N_{O} = \\frac{L_{\\text{lag}}}{l_{O}} = \\frac{6 \\times 10^{6}}{200} = 3 \\times 10^{4}$.\nEach fragment is initiated by Pol $\\alpha$, which synthesizes a tract of length $l_{\\alpha} = 20$ nt. The total initial length synthesized by Pol $\\alpha$ is:\n$L_{\\alpha, \\text{init}} = N_{O} \\times l_{\\alpha} = (3 \\times 10^{4}) \\times 20 = 6 \\times 10^{5}$ nt.\nDuring maturation, a fraction $q = 0.8$ of this DNA is replaced. The length of Pol $\\alpha$-synthesized DNA that remains in the final genome is:\n$L_{\\alpha, \\text{final}} = L_{\\alpha, \\text{init}} \\times (1 - q) = (6 \\times 10^{5}) \\times (1 - 0.8) = 1.2 \\times 10^{5}$ nt.\nThe expected number of mutations from Pol $\\alpha$ is:\n$E_{\\alpha} = L_{\\alpha, \\text{final}} \\times r_{\\alpha, \\text{final}} = (1.2 \\times 10^{5}) \\times (1 \\times 10^{-8}) = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n\nThe remainder of the lagging strand is synthesized by Pol $\\delta$. This includes the bulk of the Okazaki fragments and the tracts that replace the excised Pol $\\alpha$ primers. The total length is:\n$L_{\\delta, \\text{final}} = L_{\\text{lag}} - L_{\\alpha, \\text{final}} = (6 \\times 10^{6}) - (1.2 \\times 10^{5}) = 5.88 \\times 10^{6}$ bp.\nThe expected number of mutations from Pol $\\delta$ is:\n$E_{\\delta} = L_{\\delta, \\text{final}} \\times r_{\\delta, \\text{final}} = (5.88 \\times 10^{6}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-12}) = 47.04 \\times 10^{-6} = 4.704 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n\nFinally, we sum the expected mutations from all three polymerases:\n$E_{\\text{total}} = E_{\\varepsilon} + E_{\\delta} + E_{\\alpha}$\n$E_{\\text{total}} = (6 \\times 10^{-5}) + (4.704 \\times 10^{-5}) + (1.2 \\times 10^{-3})$\n$E_{\\text{total}} = 0.00006 + 0.00004704 + 0.0012 = 0.00130704$.\n\nThe problem requires the answer as a single decimal number rounded to four significant figures.\n$E_{\\text{total}} \\approx 0.001307$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.001307}\n$$", "id": "2604888"}]}
