It describes a standard scenario in the biophysical chemistry of nucleic acids. All parameters provided are physically realistic and sufficient for a unique solution. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this system is the conservation of the topological linking number, $Lk$, for a covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) molecule in the absence of topoisomerase enzymes. The linking number is an integer constant representing the number of times one strand winds around the other. It is related to the twist ($Tw$, the number of helical turns) and writhe ($Wr$, a measure of the coiling of the helix axis in space) by the equation:\n$$Lk = Tw + Wr$$\n\nThe problem begins with a relaxed plasmid of length $L = 5400$ base pairs (bp). In its relaxed state, the DNA is assumed to lie flat, meaning its writhe is zero ($Wr_0 = 0$). The linking number of this initial relaxed state, denoted $Lk_0$, is therefore equal to its twist, $Tw_0$. The twist is the total number of base pairs divided by the helical repeat, $h = 10.5$ bp/turn.\n$$Lk = Lk_0 = Tw_0 = \\frac{L}{h}$$\nSince no strand breaks occur, this value of $Lk$ remains constant throughout the process.\n$$Lk_0 = \\frac{5400}{10.5} = \\frac{10800}{21} = \\frac{3600}{7} \\approx 514.286$$\nThis is the fixed linking number of the plasmid.\n\nNext, an intercalating ligand is introduced. The ligand binds and unwinds the DNA duplex. This alters the preferred, or intrinsic, helical structure of the DNA. To quantify the resulting supercoiling, we must determine the new reference state, which is the linking number the plasmid *would have* if it were allowed to relax in the presence of the ligand. This relaxed linking number under the new chemical conditions is denoted $Lk_0^{\\ast}$.\n\nThe total number of bound ligand molecules, $N$, is given by the product of the binding density, $r$, and the total number of base pairs, $L$:\n$$N = r \\times L = 0.08 \\, \\frac{\\text{ligands}}{\\text{bp}} \\times 5400 \\, \\text{bp} = 432 \\, \\text{ligands}$$\nEach ligand unwinds the helix by an angle of $\\Delta\\phi_{ligand} = 26^{\\circ}$. The total change in twist, $\\Delta Tw$, caused by the binding of all ligand molecules is the total unwinding angle divided by the number of degrees in a full turn ($360^{\\circ}$). The unwinding leads to a decrease in twist, so the change is negative.\n$$\\Delta Tw_{ligand} = -\\frac{N \\times \\Delta\\phi_{ligand}}{360^{\\circ}} = -\\frac{(r \\times L) \\times 26^{\\circ}}{360^{\\circ}}$$\n\nThe linking number of the hypothetical relaxed state with ligand, $Lk_0^{\\ast}$, is equal to its twist, $Tw_0^{\\ast}$, as writhe would be zero. This new preferred twist is the original twist, $Tw_0$, modified by the unwinding effect of the ligand, $\\Delta Tw_{ligand}$.\n$$Lk_0^{\\ast} = Tw_0^{\\ast} = Tw_0 + \\Delta Tw_{ligand} = \\frac{L}{h} - \\frac{rL \\cdot 26}{360}$$\n\nThe superhelical density, $\\sigma$, is defined as the fractional change in linking number relative to the relaxed state under the prevailing conditions.\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{Lk - Lk_0^{\\ast}}{Lk_0^{\\ast}}$$\nThe actual linking number $Lk$ is conserved and equals the initial linking number $Lk_0 = L/h$.

The fifth significant digit is $4$, which is less than $5$, so we do not round up the last digit.\n$$\\sigma \\approx 0.06458$$\nThe positive sign indicates that the addition of an intercalator to an initially relaxed plasmid induces positive supercoiling. This is because the conserved linking number $Lk = Lk_0$ is now greater than the preferred linking number $Lk_0^{\\ast}$ in the presence of the unwinding agent, creating an \"overwinding\" stress relative to the new equilibrium state, which is relieved by the formation of positive writhe.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.06458}$$", "id": "2557491"}, {"introduction": "This final exercise bridges theory with experimental practice by simulating the analysis of a topoisomerase assay.

The densitometry data is internally consistent, as the sum of normalized areas is $0.10 + 0.40 + 0.30 + 0.20 = 1.00$. All definitions and relationships ($Lk = Tw+Wr$, $Lk_0=N/h$) are fundamental to the field. The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary information for the required calculations and reasoning. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or scientifically unsound premises.\n\nStep 3: Verdict.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested for the quantitative analysis, followed by a qualitative analysis of the enzyme's properties.\n\nFirst, we determine the relaxed linking number, $Lk_0$. For a relaxed, closed circular DNA molecule whose axis is constrained to a plane ($Wr=0$), the linking number is equal to the twist. The twist is the total number of helical turns. This is calculated by dividing the total number of base pairs, $N$, by the number of base pairs per helical turn, $h$.\n$$Lk_0 = \\frac{N}{h}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$Lk_0 = \\frac{4200}{10.5} = 400$$\nThe relaxed linking number for this plasmid under the specified conditions is $400$.\n\nSecond, we compute the ensemble-averaged linking number difference, $\\overline{\\Delta Lk}$. The problem provides a distribution of topoisomers, each with a specific linking number difference $\\Delta Lk_i$ and a corresponding mole fraction $f_i$ (given as normalized area). The average value is the weighted mean of the distribution.\n$$\\overline{\\Delta Lk} = \\sum_{i} f_i \\cdot (\\Delta Lk_i)$$\nUsing the provided data:\n$$\\overline{\\Delta Lk} = (0.10) \\cdot (-6) + (0.40) \\cdot (-8) + (0.30) \\cdot (-10) + (0.20) \\cdot (-12)$$\n$$\\overline{\\Delta Lk} = -0.60 - 3.20 - 3.00 - 2.40$$\n$$\\overline{\\Delta Lk} = -9.20$$\n\nThird, we determine the mean superhelical density, $\\overline{\\sigma}$. Superhelical density $\\sigma$ is a normalized measure of supercoiling, defined as the linking number difference divided by the relaxed linking number. The mean superhelical density is therefore:\n$$\\overline{\\sigma} = \\frac{\\overline{\\Delta Lk}}{Lk_0}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for $\\overline{\\Delta Lk}$ and $Lk_0$:\n$$\\overline{\\sigma} = \\frac{-9.20}{400} = -0.023$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed to four significant figures. Thus, we write the result as $-0.02300$.\n\nSeparately, we analyze the properties of the topoisomerase.\nThe observed topoisomers have linking number differences of $\\Delta Lk = -6, -8, -10, -12$. These are all even integers. The linking number, $Lk$, is an integer.\nThere are two major classes of topoisomerases.\nType I topoisomerases create a transient single-strand break in the DNA, allowing the intact strand to pass through the break before resealing. This mechanism changes the linking number in steps of one: $\\Delta Lk = \\pm 1$. A reaction catalyzed by a Type I enzyme would produce a distribution of topoisomers where adjacent bands differ by $\\Delta Lk = 1$.\nType II topoisomerases create a transient double-strand break and pass another segment of the same DNA molecule through this break. This mechanism changes the linking number in steps of two: $\\Delta Lk = \\pm 2$. A reaction catalyzed by a Type II enzyme produces a distribution of topoisomers where all species have linking numbers of the same parity (all even or all odd), and adjacent bands differ by $\\Delta Lk = 2$.\nThe observed data, with $\\Delta Lk$ values being exclusively even integers, is the definitive signature of a Type II topoisomerase.\n\nNext, we assess the direction of the reaction. The initial state of the plasmid is assumed to be relaxed, with an average $\\Delta Lk \\approx 0$. After the reaction, the entire population of plasmids has been shifted to states with negative linking number differences, with a mean value $\\overline{\\Delta Lk} = -9.2$. This demonstrates that the enzyme actively introduces negative supercoils into the DNA, rather than simply relaxing existing supercoils. Most topoisomerases relax supercoiling in an ATP-independent manner, driving the system toward the thermodynamic equilibrium of $\\Delta Lk = 0$. However, certain Type II topoisomerases, such as DNA gyrase found in bacteria, use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to actively introduce negative supercoils, driving the linking number to a steady-state value far from equilibrium. The presence of $2\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ ATP in the buffer is consistent with the action of such an ATP-dependent enzyme that introduces negative supercoils.\nTherefore, the enzyme is most plausibly a Type II topoisomerase that actively introduces negative supercoils, fueled by ATP hydrolysis.\nThe final required output is solely the numerical value for the mean superhelical density.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.02300}$$", "id": "2557462"}]}
