Using hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor patterns, argue from first principles why GU wobble pairs can still be accommodated in an A-form helix, and then compute the expected free energy penalty of a single isolated GU wobble pair relative to a GC pair in the same helix under the following physically motivated assumptions.\n\nBase your reasoning on these general, widely accepted principles:\n- Complementary donor–acceptor matching allows formation of specific hydrogen bonds when geometric constraints permit orbital overlap and favorable electrostatics.\n- The Gibbs free energy change for forming interactions is given by $\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S$, and for approximately independent contributions, free energies are additive.\n- In a regular A-form RNA helix, hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions are the dominant local stabilizing forces.\n\nUse the model and parameters below:\n1. Each canonical hydrogen bond in a regular A-form environment has an enthalpy and entropy contribution of $\\Delta h_{\\mathrm{HB}} = -1.9$ kcal mol$^{-1}$ and $\\Delta s_{\\mathrm{HB}} = -2.4$ cal mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$, respectively. Assume additivity over bonds for the intrinsic base-pairing contribution.\n2. A GC pair forms $3$ canonical hydrogen bonds.\n3. A GU wobble pair forms $2$ hydrogen bonds. One of these has canonical-like geometry and uses the same $\\Delta h_{\\mathrm{HB}}$ and $\\Delta s_{\\mathrm{HB}}$ as above. The second is weakened by suboptimal donor–acceptor alignment: its enthalpy contribution is scaled by a factor $\\alpha = 0.80$ and its entropy magnitude is scaled by a factor $\\beta = 0.90$ relative to the canonical values (i.e., $\\Delta h = \\alpha \\Delta h_{\\mathrm{HB}}$ and $\\Delta s = \\beta \\Delta s_{\\mathrm{HB}}$ for that bond).\n4. Because the GU wobble perturbs base stacking and leaves one minor-groove acceptor less optimally satisfied, assign a context-averaged stacking penalty $\\delta_{\\mathrm{stack}} = +0.60$ kcal mol$^{-1}$ and a solvation penalty $\\delta_{\\mathrm{solv}} = +0.25$ kcal mol$^{-1}$ to the GU pair relative to GC.

It presents a standard biophysical chemistry calculation based on a simplified but consistent thermodynamic model of RNA base pairing. All required parameters are provided, and the objective is clearly defined. The premises are consistent with established principles of nucleic acid structure and thermodynamics. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nFirst, the qualitative justification for the accommodation of a guanine–uracil ($GU$) wobble pair in an $A$-form helix is addressed. In a standard Watson–Crick pair, hydrogen bond donors on one base align with acceptors on the other. For a $GU$ pair, this canonical alignment is not possible. However, a lateral displacement (a \"wobble\") of the bases within the helical plane allows for the formation of two alternative hydrogen bonds: one between the guanine $O6$ (acceptor) and the uracil $N3$ proton (donor), and another between the guanine $N1$ proton (donor) and the uracil $O2$ (acceptor). This arrangement results in a base pair geometry where the $C1'$—$C1'$ distance across the pair is similar enough to that of a canonical Watson–Crick pair to be incorporated into the regular sugar-phosphate backbone of an $A$-form helix with only minor local distortions.\n\nNext, the quantitative calculation of the free energy penalty, $\\Delta\\Delta G = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{GU}} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{GC}}$, is performed. The Gibbs free energy for the formation of a base pair is given by $\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S$. We will calculate the total free energy contribution for a guanine–cytosine ($GC$) pair and a $GU$ wobble pair based on the provided model.\n\nThe free energy of the $GC$ reference pair, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{GC}}$, is calculated. A $GC$ pair forms $3$ canonical hydrogen bonds. The model assumes additivity and no other penalties for the reference pair.\nThe enthalpy contribution is $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{GC}} = 3 \\times \\Delta h_{\\mathrm{HB}}$.\nThe entropy contribution is $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{GC}} = 3 \\times \\Delta s_{\\mathrm{HB}}$.\nThus, the free energy for the $GC$ pair is:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{GC}} = \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{GC}} - T \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{GC}} = 3 \\Delta h_{\\mathrm{HB}} - T (3 \\Delta s_{\\mathrm{HB}}) = 3(\\Delta h_{\\mathrm{HB}} - T \\Delta s_{\\mathrm{HB}}) $$\n\nThe free energy of the $GU$ wobble pair, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{GU}}$, is now calculated.

Its enthalpy contribution is $\\alpha \\Delta h_{\\mathrm{HB}}$ and its entropy contribution is $\\beta \\Delta s_{\\mathrm{HB}}$.\nThe total hydrogen bond enthalpy for the $GU$ pair is $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{HB, GU}} = \\Delta h_{\\mathrm{HB}} + \\alpha \\Delta h_{\\mathrm{HB}} = (1 + \\alpha) \\Delta h_{\\mathrm{HB}}$.\nThe total hydrogen bond entropy is $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{HB, GU}} = \\Delta s_{\\mathrm{HB}} + \\beta \\Delta s_{\\mathrm{HB}} = (1 + \\beta) \\Delta s_{\\mathrm{HB}}$.\nThe free energy from hydrogen bonding in the $GU$ pair is:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{HB, GU}} = (1 + \\alpha) \\Delta h_{\\mathrm{HB}} - T(1 + \\beta) \\Delta s_{\\mathrm{HB}} $$\nAdditionally, the $GU$ pair has a stacking penalty $\\delta_{\\mathrm{stack}}$ and a solvation penalty $\\delta_{\\mathrm{solv}}$.\nThe total free energy for the $GU$ pair is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{GU}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{HB, GU}} + \\delta_{\\mathrm{stack}} + \\delta_{\\mathrm{solv}} = (1 + \\alpha) \\Delta h_{\\mathrm{HB}} - T(1 + \\beta) \\Delta s_{\\mathrm{HB}} + \\delta_{\\mathrm{stack}} + \\delta_{\\mathrm{solv}} $$\n\nThe free energy penalty $\\Delta\\Delta G$ is the difference $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{GU}} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{GC}}$:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G = [(1 + \\alpha) \\Delta h_{\\mathrm{HB}} - T(1 + \\beta) \\Delta s_{\\mathrm{HB}} + \\delta_{\\mathrm{stack}} + \\delta_{\\mathrm{solv}}] - [3(\\Delta h_{\\mathrm{HB}} - T \\Delta s_{\\mathrm{HB}})] $$\nGrouping terms by $\\Delta h_{\\mathrm{HB}}$ and $\\Delta s_{\\mathrm{HB}}$:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G = (1 + \\alpha - 3) \\Delta h_{\\mathrm{HB}} - T(1 + \\beta - 3) \\Delta s_{\\mathrm{HB}} + \\delta_{\\mathrm{stack}} + \\delta_{\\mathrm{solv}} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G = (\\alpha - 2) \\Delta h_{\\mathrm{HB}} - T(\\beta - 2) \\Delta s_{\\mathrm{HB}} + \\delta_{\\mathrm{stack}} + \\delta_{\\mathrm{solv}} $$\n\nNow, substitute the given numerical values into this expression.\nThe parameters are:\n$\\Delta h_{\\mathrm{HB}} = -1.9$ kcal mol$^{-1}$\n$\\Delta s_{\\mathrm{HB}} = -2.4$ cal mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-1} = -0.0024$ kcal mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$\n$\\alpha = 0.80$\n$\\beta = 0.90$\n$T = 310$ K\n$\\delta_{\\mathrm{stack}} = +0.60$ kcal mol$^{-1}$\n$\\delta_{\\mathrm{solv}} = +0.25$ kcal mol$^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G = (0.80 - 2) \\times (-1.9 \\text{ kcal mol}^{-1}) - (310 \\text{ K}) \\times (0.90 - 2) \\times (-0.0024 \\text{ kcal mol}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}) + 0.60 \\text{ kcal mol}^{-1} + 0.25 \\text{ kcal mol}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G = (-1.20) \\times (-1.9) - (310) \\times (-1.10) \\times (-0.0024) + 0.85 \\text{ kcal mol}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G = 2.28 - (310 \\times 1.10 \\times 0.0024) + 0.85 \\text{ kcal mol}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G = 2.28 - 0.8184 + 0.85 \\text{ kcal mol}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G = 3.13 - 0.8184 \\text{ kcal mol}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G = 2.3116 \\text{ kcal mol}^{-1} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G \\approx 2.312 \\text{ kcal mol}^{-1} $$\nThis positive value indicates, as expected, that replacing a $GC$ pair with a $GU$ wobble pair is thermodynamically unfavorable, resulting in a destabilization of the helix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.312}$$", "id": "2603623"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the thermodynamic principles of individual base pairs and loops, we can predict the overall most stable, or Minimum Free Energy (MFE), secondary structure for an entire RNA sequence.

The pair $(11,23)$ becomes a mismatch in state $\\mathcal{B}$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of statistical thermodynamics and nucleic acid biophysics. It describes a common scenario of a conformational switch, analyzed with a standard experimental technique (SHAPE). The provided data are specific, quantitative, and self-consistent. The problem is well-posed; it provides all necessary information to calculate the state populations and the expected observable (SHAPE reactivity). A potential ambiguity is whether to include an unfolded state. However, given the large negative free energies of states $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$ relative to a presumed unfolded reference state ($\\Delta G_U = 0$), the population of the unfolded state would be negligible. For instance, $f_U \\propto \\exp(0) = 1$, while $f_\\mathcal{A} \\propto \\exp(7.5/0.616) \\approx 2 \\times 10^5$. Thus, considering only the two specified folded states is a valid and standard simplification. The problem is not flawed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with a full derivation and analysis.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe problem requires the calculation of ensemble-averaged SHAPE reactivities for several RNA constructs. The central principle is the population-weighted average of an observable. For a nucleotide position $j$, its SHAPE reactivity $r_j$ is given by:\n$$ r_j = f_\\mathcal{A} r_{j,\\mathcal{A}} + f_\\mathcal{B} r_{j,\\mathcal{B}} $$\nwhere $f_\\mathcal{A}$ and $f_\\mathcal{B}$ are the populations of states $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$, and $r_{j,\\mathcal{A}}$ and $r_{j,\\mathcal{B}}$ are the reactivities of nucleotide $j$ in those pure states. The populations are determined by the Boltzmann distribution. Since states $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$ are the only significant populations, their fractions must sum to $1$.\n$$ f_\\mathcal{A} + f_\\mathcal{B} = 1 $$\nThe relative populations are given by the difference in free energy, $\\Delta \\Delta G = \\Delta G_\\mathcal{A} - \\Delta G_\\mathcal{B}$.\n$$ \\frac{f_\\mathcal{A}}{f_\\mathcal{B}} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\Delta G_\\mathcal{A}/RT)}{\\exp(-\\Delta G_\\mathcal{B}/RT)} = \\exp(-(\\Delta G_\\mathcal{A} - \\Delta G_\\mathcal{B})/RT) = \\exp(-\\Delta \\Delta G/RT) $$\nFrom this, we derive the population of state $\\mathcal{A}$:\n$$ f_\\mathcal{A} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(\\Delta \\Delta G/RT)} $$\nWe are given $r_{\\mathrm{paired}} = 0.2$ and $r_{\\mathrm{unpaired}} = 1.0$.\n\nWe analyze each construct systematically.\n\n**1.

The reasoning is correct.\n- **M7+23'**: States $r_7 \\approx 0.20$, $r_{23} \\approx 0.20$, $r_{11} \\to \\approx 0.99$. My calculation yields $r_7 \\approx 0.21$, $r_{23} \\approx 0.21$, and $r_{11} \\approx 1.0$. The value $0.99$ for $r_{11}$ is consistent with the massive population shift to state A.

WT: $r_7 \\approx 0.75$, $r_{11} \\approx 0.45$, $r_{23} \\approx 0.20$. $\\mathrm{M7}$: $r_7$ decreases because disrupting a helix reduces flexibility; $r_{11}$ increases due to allosteric compensation; $r_{23}$ unchanged. $\\mathrm{M23x}$: only $r_{23}$ increases; $r_7$ and $r_{11}$ remain near WT. $\\mathrm{M7{+}23'}$: all three positions show low reactivity because both helices form simultaneously.**\n\n- **WT**: The values for $r_7$ and $r_{11}$ are swapped, which would imply $\\Delta G_\\mathcal{B} < \\Delta G_\\mathcal{A}$, contrary to the given data.

Disrupting a base pair increases flexibility and thus *increases* SHAPE reactivity. Incorrect.\n- **M23x**: The claim that $r_7$ and $r_{11}$ remain near WT is false.

It completely ignores the population shift induced by the mutation. As we calculated, the change in populations $f_\\mathcal{A}$ and $f_\\mathcal{B}$ alters the ensemble average for all positions ($11$ and $23$) whose pairing status differs between the states. This is a critical error. Incorrect.\n- **M23x**: The claim \"only one of $r_7$ or $r_{11}$ increases\" is incorrect.
