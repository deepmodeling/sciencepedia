Consider the following kinetic model grounded in elementary mass-action kinetics and the memoryless property of Poisson processes.\n\nAfter an incision by apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease $1$ (APE1) exposes a $5^{\\prime}$-dRP group, two competing, memoryless processes initiate from the same intermediate:\n- $5^{\\prime}$-dRP excision by the Pol $\\beta$ lyase step (short-patch commitment) with rate $r_{L}$,\n- initiation of strand-displacement synthesis (long-patch commitment) with rate $r_{D}$.\n\nAssume that whichever event happens first irreversibly commits the pathway choice. If strand-displacement initiates, subsequent patch length growth proceeds in discrete nucleotide steps. At each step, there is a kinetic competition between:\n- continuation by polymerase incorporation at rate $r_{p}$,\n- termination via flap processing and ligation (requiring FEN1 and DNA ligase) at an effective rate $r_{T}$.\n\nAssume these stepwise continuation and termination events are memoryless and independent between steps. Mechanistically, long-patch BER inserts at least two nucleotides; thus, once strand-displacement initiates, the patch length $L$ has support on $\\{2,3,4,\\dots\\}$ with stepwise termination governed by the above competition.\n\nOxidation of the $5^{\\prime}$-dRP adduct is known to suppress Pol $\\beta$ lyase catalysis. Model this as a multiplicative decrease in the lyase rate by a factor $\\delta$ (with $0 < \\delta < 1$), leaving $r_{D}$, $r_{p}$, and $r_{T}$ unchanged.\n\nUsing only the principles stated above (competing Poisson processes and the memoryless property), derive the expected patch length and use it to compute the fold-increase in the mean patch length upon oxidation.

It presents a clear, formalizable kinetic model of DNA base excision repair based on established principles of competing Poisson processes. All necessary parameters are provided. Therefore, the problem is valid and a rigorous solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for the fold-increase in the mean patch length of Base Excision Repair (BER) when the $5^{\\prime}$-dRP lyase activity of DNA polymerase beta is suppressed. The overall patch length, which we denote as the random variable $L$, depends on an initial stochastic choice between two pathways: short-patch (SP) and long-patch (LP).\n\nFirst, we model the pathway choice. After incision by APE1, two competing, memoryless processes are initiated: lyase activity committing to SP with rate $r_L$, and strand displacement committing to LP with rate $r_D$. For two competing independent Poisson processes with rates $r_1$ and $r_2$, the probability that process $1$ occurs first is given by $\\frac{r_1}{r_1 + r_2}$. Thus, the probabilities for choosing the short-patch and long-patch pathways are:\n$$P_{SP} = \\frac{r_L}{r_L + r_D}$$\n$$P_{LP} = \\frac{r_D}{r_L + r_D}$$\nIt is clear that $P_{SP} + P_{LP} = 1$.\n\nNext, we establish the patch length for each pathway.\nFor the short-patch pathway, a single nucleotide is replaced. Thus, if this pathway is chosen, the patch length is fixed at $L_{SP} = 1$.\nFor the long-patch pathway, the problem states that at least two nucleotides are inserted, so the patch length $L_{LP}$ has support on the set $\\{2, 3, 4, \\dots\\}$. The length is determined by a stepwise competition between polymerase continuation (rate $r_p$) and termination (rate $r_T$). At each step, the probability of termination is $p_{term} = \\frac{r_T}{r_p + r_T}$, and the probability of continuation is $p_{cont} = \\frac{r_p}{r_p + r_T}$.\nLet $N$ be the number of nucleotides inserted *after* the initial two guaranteed nucleotides of the long-patch pathway. $N$ can take values in $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$. The event $N=n$ corresponds to $n$ successful continuation steps followed by one termination step. Since the steps are memoryless and independent, the probability distribution of $N$ is geometric:\n$$P(N=n) = (p_{cont})^n p_{term}$$\nThe expected value of a random variable following this geometric distribution is:\n$$E[N] = \\frac{p_{cont}}{p_{term}} = \\frac{r_p / (r_p + r_T)}{r_T / (r_p + r_T)} = \\frac{r_p}{r_T}$$\nThe total patch length for the long-patch pathway is $L_{LP} = 2 + N$. The expected patch length for the long-patch pathway is therefore:\n$$E[L_{LP}] = E[2+N] = 2 + E[N] = 2 + \\frac{r_p}{r_T}$$\n\nNow, we can find the overall mean patch length, $\\langle L \\rangle$, using the law of total expectation:\n$$\\langle L \\rangle = E[L] = P_{SP} \\cdot E[L | \\text{pathway is SP}] + P_{LP} \\cdot E[L | \\text{pathway is LP}]$$\nSubstituting the expressions we have derived:\n$$\\langle L \\rangle = \\left(\\frac{r_L}{r_L + r_D}\\right) \\cdot 1 + \\left(\\frac{r_D}{r_L + r_D}\\right) \\cdot \\left(2 + \\frac{r_p}{r_T}\\right)$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$\\langle L \\rangle = \\frac{r_L + r_D \\left(2 + \\frac{r_p}{r_T}\\right)}{r_L + r_D}$$\nThis is the general expression for the mean patch length.\n\nWe are given the following parameter values: $r_{L} = 1.2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $r_{D} = 0.3\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $r_{p} = 6.0\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and $r_{T} = 2.0\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nFirst, we calculate the expected length for the long-patch pathway, which is independent of the oxidation state:\n$$E[L_{LP}] = 2 + \\frac{r_p}{r_T} = 2 + \\frac{6.0}{2.0} = 2 + 3 = 5$$\n\nFor the unoxidized (normal) case, we use the given value of $r_L$:\n$$\\langle L \\rangle_{unox} = \\frac{r_L + r_D \\cdot E[L_{LP}]}{r_L + r_D} = \\frac{1.2 + 0.3 \\cdot 5}{1.2 + 0.3} = \\frac{1.2 + 1.5}{1.5} = \\frac{2.7}{1.5} = 1.8$$\n\nFor the oxidized case, the lyase rate $r_L$ is reduced by a factor $\\delta = 0.04$. The new rate, $r'_L$, is:\n$$r'_L = \\delta \\cdot r_L = 0.04 \\cdot 1.2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 0.048\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nAll other rates remain unchanged.
