Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be furnished.\n\nThe task is to compute the redox poise, $E$, of the ubiquinone/ubiquinol pool under non-standard conditions. The governing relation for this is the Nernst equation.

The magnitude of the free energy change is substantial. This large, negative free energy change serves as the thermodynamic driving force for the entire sequence of events at the Qo site.\n\nThe complete oxidation of one molecule of QH$_2$ to ubiquinone (Q) at the Qo site is a two-electron process that results in the release of two protons:\n$$ \\text{QH}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{Q} + 2e^- + 2\\text{H}^+ $$\nThis process occurs in discrete steps.

The strongly exergonic nature of this specific step ($\\Delta G'^\\circ = -20.26\\ \\text{kJ}\\ \\text{mol}^{-1}$) is critical. It provides the necessary energy to initiate the oxidation of QH$_2$ and overcome the energetic barriers associated with the formation of a highly unstable semiquinone radical intermediate ($\\text{Q}^{\\cdot-}$ or QH$^\\cdot$).\n\nCrucially, the removal of an electron from QH$_2$ drastically increases the acidity of the remaining protons (i.e., it significantly lowers the pKa of the intermediate species). This thermodynamic \"pull\" exerted by the high-potential Rieske cluster facilitates the sequential deprotonation events. The first proton is released upon formation of the semiquinone radical, and the second is released upon its subsequent oxidation. The large free energy drop of the initial electron transfer effectively pays the energetic cost of these deprotonation steps, ensuring that the protons are released into the intermembrane space, even against a pre-existing proton gradient.

The rate constant, $k$, is given to be proportional to an exponential decay function of the edge-to-edge distance, $r$:\n$$\nk \\propto \\exp(-\\beta r)\n$$\nwhere $\\beta$ is the electronic coupling decay constant. We can express this proportionality as an equation with a constant of proportionality, $C$:\n$$\nk = C \\exp(-\\beta r)\n$$\nIn the full expression from Marcus theory, the constant $C$ would incorporate the electronic coupling prefactor and the Franck-Condon factor, which depends on the thermodynamic driving force ($\\Delta G^{\\circ}$), the reorganization energy ($\\lambda$), and the temperature ($T$). The problem statement posits that both electron transfer steps occur under the same thermodynamic driving force and reorganization energy. This is a critical simplification, as it implies that the Franck-Condon factors for both reactions are identical. Consequently, the constant $C$ is the same for both rate expressions.\n\nLet $k_{\\text{R} \\to c_1}$ be the rate constant for the Rieske $\\to c_1$ transfer over a distance $r_{\\text{R} \\to c_1} = 12\\ \\text{\\AA}$.\nLet $k_{b_L \\to b_H}$ be the rate constant for the $b_L \\to b_H$ transfer over a distance $r_{b_L \\to b_H} = 10\\ \\text{\\AA}$.\nThe value of the decay constant is given as $\\beta = 1.4\\ \\text{\\AA}^{-1}$.\n\nWe can write the specific rate constants as:\n$$\nk_{\\text{R} \\to c_1} = C \\exp(-\\beta r_{\\text{R} \\to c_1})\n$$\n$$\nk_{b_L \\to b_H} = C \\exp(-\\beta r_{b_L \\to b_H})\n$$\nThe problem requires the computation of the dimensionless ratio of these two rate constants.

The bifurcation at the $Q_o$ site must be a highly controlled process to ensure efficiency and prevent unproductive side reactions. After $QH_2$ donates its two electrons, one to the high-potential Rieske center and one to the low-potential heme $b_L$, these electrons must be rapidly committed to their respective downstream pathways. The substantially faster kinetics for the $b_L \\to b_H$ step ensures that the electron entering the low-potential branch is quickly shuttled away from the $Q_o$ site and towards the $Q_i$ site. This rapid removal helps enforce the directionality of the cycle and minimizes the lifetime of the electron on heme $b_L$, thereby preventing a potential back-reaction with the semiquinone intermediate at $Q_o$.
