This problem challenges you to dissect the intricate mechanism of the $F_o$ motor's rotary engine at the atomic level. By applying fundamental principles of electrostatics and acid-base chemistry, you will evaluate the specific roles of conserved amino acid residues in coupling proton flow to directional rotation and preventing energy-dissipating leaks, thereby building a deep, mechanistic intuition for the enzyme's function [@problem_id:2542623].", "problem": "Adenosine Triphosphate synthase (ATP synthase) couples the proton motive force (PMF) to rotary catalysis via the membrane-embedded $F_{\\mathrm{o}}$ motor, which consists of an $a$-subunit forming two aqueous half-channels and a rotating $c$-ring that carries a conserved carboxylate (for example, $c$Asp$61$ in Escherichia coli numbering). A conserved positively charged residue in the $a$-subunit (for example, $a$Arg$210$) and a conserved acidic residue lining the inlet half-channel (for example, $a$Glu$219$) are near the $a$–$c$ interface. Consider the following mechanistic features and mutants in light of fundamental electrostatics and acid–base chemistry:\n\n- The free energy change for deprotonating a site with effective acidity constant $\\mathrm{p}K_a^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ at a local proton activity characterized by $pH$ is $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{deprot}} \\approx 2.303\\,R T\\,(pH - \\mathrm{p}K_a^{\\mathrm{eff}})$, so that an increased $\\mathrm{p}K_a^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ in a hydrophobic environment stabilizes the protonated (neutral) form.\n- Coulombic interactions between point charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ separated by distance $r$ in a medium of dielectric constant $\\varepsilon$ contribute $E \\propto \\dfrac{q_1 q_2}{\\varepsilon r}$ to the energy, so a positively charged $a$Arg$210$ can stabilize a deprotonated (negatively charged) $c$Asp$61$ and disfavor proton accumulation between half-channels.\n- The PMF provides an electrochemical driving force $\\Delta \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^+}$ that biases proton flow from the inlet half-channel to the outlet half-channel and must be coupled to rotation by protonation and deprotonation cycles on the $c$-ring.\n\nWhich of the following statements are most consistent with these principles and with preventing ion short-circuiting while ensuring directional rotation?\n\nA. $a$Arg$210$ acts as an electrostatic gate at the $a$–$c$ interface: by presenting a local positive field between the inlet and outlet half-channels, it raises the energetic cost of forming a continuous proton wire between them (suppressing short-circuiting) and stabilizes the deprotonated state of an adjacent $c$Asp$61$ at the outlet, thereby promoting proton release to the low-proton side and biasing forward rotation; neutralizing $a$Arg$210$ increases leak and reduces directionality.\n\nB. $a$Glu$219$ serves primarily as a transient proton carrier that bypasses the half-channels by directly handing a proton to $c$Asp$61$ within the hydrophobic $a$–$c$ interface; therefore, converting $a$Glu$219$ to a neutral amide (for example, $a$E$219$Q) would be expected to increase coupling efficiency by forcing protons to traverse the $c$-ring interior rather than the half-channels.\n\nC. $c$Asp$61$ must have an elevated $\\mathrm{p}K_a^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ in the hydrophobic membrane to remain protonated (neutral) during rotation through lipid, minimizing the penalty from burying charge; at the outlet half-channel, exposure to aqueous environment and the local positive field near $a$Arg$210$ lower the effective free energy for deprotonation, favoring proton release; replacing $c$Asp$61$ with an amide (for example, $c$D$61$N) eliminates the essential protonatable group and abolishes rotation despite an intact PMF.\n\nD. In the absence of $a$Arg$210$, directionality is preserved because torque arises solely from thermal fluctuations rectified by the F$_{\\mathrm{1}}$ catalytic sector, and a continuous water wire across the two half-channels still enforces unidirectional proton flow without increasing leak.\n\nE. The primary role of $a$Glu$219$ is to electrostatically repel protons within the inlet half-channel so that only deprotonated $c$Asp$61$ can enter the interface; neutralizing $a$Glu$219$ (for example, $a$E$219$Q) would therefore increase uncoupled proton flux through the half-channels by removing this repulsion.\n\nSelect all that apply.", "solution": "The problem statement describes the F$_{\\mathrm{o}}$ motor of ATP synthase and asks to evaluate several mechanistic statements based on fundamental principles of electrostatics and acid-base chemistry.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\nFirst, the validity of the problem statement must be assessed.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **System:** The membrane-embedded F$_{\\mathrm{o}}$ motor of ATP synthase, composed of an $a$-subunit and a rotating $c$-ring.\n- **Key residues:**\n    - A conserved carboxylate on the $c$-ring (e.g., $c$Asp$61$).\n    - A conserved positive residue in the $a$-subunit (e.g., $a$Arg$210$).\n    - A conserved acidic residue in the $a$-subunit inlet half-channel (e.g., $a$Glu$219$).\n- **Physical principles:**\n    1.

The roles of the specified residues and the application of physical chemistry principles are standard and correct representations of the scientific consensus.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear context, a set of principles, and a question that can be answered by applying logical reasoning based on these principles.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free from subjective elements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, unambiguous, and self-contained. It is a valid problem that can be solved.\n\n### Solution and Option Analysis\n\nWe will now analyze each statement based on the provided principles.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\nThis statement proposes a dual role for $a$Arg$210$: preventing proton short-circuiting and facilitating proton release at the outlet.\n1.  **Preventing short-circuiting:** The $a$Arg$210$ residue is positively charged. It is located at the $a-c$ interface, physically separating the inlet and outlet half-channels. According to the Coulombic principle ($E \\propto \\dfrac{q_1 q_2}{\\varepsilon r}$), this positive charge will create a repulsive potential energy barrier for protons ($H^+$), which are also positively charged. This barrier would make it energetically unfavorable for protons to move directly from the inlet to the outlet without interacting with the $c$-ring, thus suppressing uncoupled leak (a short-circuit). This reasoning is correct.\n2.  **Facilitating proton release:** At the outlet channel, a $c$-ring subunit carrying a protonated $c$Asp$61$ arrives. For rotation to proceed, this proton must be released. The statement suggests that the positive field of $a$Arg$210$ stabilizes the deprotonated (negatively charged, $c$Asp$61^−$) state. A favorable electrostatic interaction ($q_1 q_2  0$) between $a$Arg$210^+$ and $c$Asp$61^−$ lowers the system's energy, which effectively lowers the $\\mathrm{p}K_a^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ of the aspartate. According to the given formula, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{deprot}} \\approx 2.303\\,R T\\,(pH - \\mathrm{p}K_a^{\\mathrm{eff}})$, a lower $\\mathrm{p}K_a^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ makes $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{deprot}}$ more negative, thus making deprotonation more spontaneous. This is precisely the function required at the outlet to ensure proton release and bias the direction of rotation. This reasoning is also correct.\n3.  **Effect of neutralization:** If $a$Arg$210$ is neutralized (e.g., by an R210Q mutation), both functions would be lost. The electrostatic barrier against leak would disappear, and the specific stabilization of the deprotonated $c$Asp$61$ at the a-c interface would be lost, disrupting the deprotonation step and thereby reducing the coupling and directionality of the motor. This conclusion logically follows.\n**Verdict for A:** This statement is fully consistent with the provided principles and describes the accepted role of the conserved arginine. **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\nThis statement discusses the role of $a$Glu$219$. It proposes that it acts as a transient proton carrier and that its removal would *increase* efficiency.\n1.  **Premise:** That $a$Glu$219$ acts as a proton carrier in the pathway from the inlet half-channel to the $c$Asp$61$ is a plausible model.\n2.  **Conclusion:** The statement concludes that converting $a$Glu$219$ to a neutral amide ($a$E$219$Q) would *increase* coupling efficiency. This is illogical. If a residue is a necessary component of a functional pathway (a proton carrier), its removal or replacement with a non-functional analogue must impair or abolish the pathway's function. It cannot improve it. Removing a critical link in the proton-transfer chain would uncouple the proton motive force from rotation, bringing synthesis to a halt. The claim that this would force protons through another path and increase efficiency is nonsensical, as this is the designated path.\n**Verdict for B:** The conclusion is inconsistent with the premise and fundamental biochemical principles. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThis statement describes the properties and role of $c$Asp$61$.\n1.  **Elevated $\\mathrm{p}K_a$:** The $c$-ring rotates through the hydrophobic lipid membrane. As stated in the problem, a hydrophobic environment destabilizes charge and thus increases the $\\mathrm{p}K_a^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ of an ionizable group. For the $c$Asp$61$ to carry a proton through the membrane, it must be protonated (neutral, Asp-H), which minimizes the large energetic penalty (Born energy) of placing a charge in a low-dielectric medium. An elevated $\\mathrm{p}K_a^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ ensures that the aspartate remains protonated during transit. This is correct.\n2.  **Proton release at the outlet:** The statement claims that at the outlet, exposure to the aqueous environment and the positive field of $a$Arg$210$ lowers the energy for deprotonation. As analyzed for Option A, the proximity of the positive $a$Arg$210$ stabilizes the negative $c$Asp$61^−$, effectively lowering its $\\mathrm{p}K_a^{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The aqueous environment also helps stabilize the resulting charged species. This promotes proton release to the low proton concentration side, which is necessary for the cycle. This is correct.\n3.  **Effect of neutralization:** Replacing $c$Asp$61$ with asparagine ($c$D$61$N) replaces the carboxyl group with a non-ionizable amide group. This abolishes the site for the essential protonation/deprotonation cycle. Without this cycle, the energy from the proton gradient cannot be transduced into mechanical torque. The motor would be inactivated, and rotation would cease, even with a strong PMF. This is correct.\n**Verdict for C:** The statement accurately describes the physicochemical necessities for the function of the $c$-ring carboxylate. **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nThis statement proposes a mechanism in the absence of $a$Arg$210$.\n1.  **Preservation of directionality:** The statement claims directionality is preserved without $a$Arg$210$. As established in the analysis of A, this residue is critical for biasing proton release at the correct location, which is a key determinant of directionality. Its absence would likely lead to random, futile proton exchange or rotation in both directions, severely impairing net directional rotation.\n2.  **Source of torque:** The statement attributes torque generation to \"thermal fluctuations rectified by the F$_{\\mathrm{1}}$ catalytic sector\". This is a mischaracterization. While all molecular motors operate against thermal noise, the driving force for rotation in $F_{\\mathrm{o}}$ is the electrochemical potential of protons ($\\Delta \\mu_{\\mathrm{H}^+}$), not random thermal motion. The F$_1$ sector's role is to use the rotation from F$_{\\mathrm{o}}$ to synthesize ATP; it does not generate the initial torque in this context.\n3.  **Water wire and leak:** The statement claims a \"continuous water wire\" would enforce unidirectional flow without increasing leak. A continuous water wire connecting the high-proton inlet to the low-proton outlet is the definition of a proton leak or short-circuit pathway. It would dissipate the proton gradient without being coupled to rotation. The role of $a$Arg$210$ is precisely to prevent the formation of such a wire.\n**Verdict for D:** This statement contains multiple fundamental errors regarding the mechanism of torque generation and the role of $a$Arg$210$. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option E:**\nThis statement proposes a role for $a$Glu$219$ based on electrostatic repulsion.\n1.  **Proposed role:** The statement suggests $a$Glu$219$ is deprotonated (negatively charged) and repels protons in the inlet channel. The inlet channel is on the high-proton-concentration side of the membrane (low $pH$). An acidic residue like glutamate (typical $\\mathrm{p}K_a \\approx 4.3$) is more likely to be protonated (neutral) in a low $pH$ environment, especially if it is in a partially nonpolar pocket. A repulsive role is counterintuitive to the function of the inlet, which is to facilitate protonation of the $c$Asp$61$. The goal is to move a proton *to* the $c$-ring, not repel it.\n2.  **Effect of neutralization:** Following its flawed premise, the statement concludes that neutralizing $a$Glu$219$ would increase uncoupled proton flux by removing the repulsion. Given that the premise is likely incorrect, the conclusion is baseless. Experimental mutations of this residue (e.g., E219Q) are known to be lethal or severely inhibit ATP synthesis, indicating a critical role in the *coupled* pathway, not in preventing uncoupled flux.\n**Verdict for E:** The proposed mechanism is physically and functionally implausible, and its predicted consequence is contrary to experimental evidence. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nStatements A and C accurately describe key features of the ATP synthase mechanism based on the provided physical principles.

It is found to be **valid**. It is scientifically grounded in the established physical principles of rotational dynamics applied to a well-studied biophysical system. It is well-posed, providing all necessary data and definitions for a unique solution via a standard mathematical procedure (ordinary least squares). The language is objective and unambiguous. The problem is a standard exercise in biophysical modeling and data analysis. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem rests on the steady-state torque balance equation. The rotor of the ATP synthase is driven by a chemical torque $\\tau_c$. This driving torque is counteracted by several opposing torques: the torque due to internal viscous dissipation ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{drag,int}}$), the torque due to external viscous dissipation ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{drag,ext}}$), and the torque transmitted to the external load ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{out}}$). Assuming linear viscous friction, the drag torques are given by $\\tau_{\\mathrm{drag,int}} = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{int}}\\omega$ and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{drag,ext}} = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ext}}\\omega$.\nThe torque balance equation is therefore:\n$$ \\tau_c = \\tau_{\\mathrm{drag,int}} + \\tau_{\\mathrm{drag,ext}} + \\tau_{\\mathrm{out}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the drag torques:\n$$ \\tau_c = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{int}}\\omega + \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ext}}\\omega + \\tau_{\\mathrm{out}} $$\n$$ \\tau_c = (\\gamma_{\\mathrm{int}} + \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ext}})\\omega + \\tau_{\\mathrm{out}} $$\nThe problem requires a linear relationship between $\\tau_{\\mathrm{out}}$ and $\\omega$. Rearranging the equation yields the desired form:\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\tau_c - (\\gamma_{\\mathrm{int}} + \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ext}})\\omega $$\nThis equation is a linear model of the form $y = b + mx$, where $y = \\tau_{\\mathrm{out}}$, $x = \\omega$, the y-intercept is $b = \\tau_c$, and the slope is $m = -(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{int}} + \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ext}})$.\n\nFor each dataset, we will perform an ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression on the provided $(\\omega, \\tau_{\\mathrm{out}})$ data to find the slope $\\hat{m}$ and intercept $\\hat{b}$. From these fitted parameters, we can estimate the physical quantities of interest:\n$$ \\hat{\\tau}_c = \\hat{b} $$\n$$ \\hat{\\gamma}_{\\mathrm{int}} = -\\hat{m} - \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ext}} $$\n\nNext, the internal dissipation fraction $f_{\\mathrm{int}}$ is computed. It is defined as the ratio of the power dissipated internally, $P_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{int}}\\omega^2$, to the chemical input power, $P_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\tau_c \\omega$.\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{int}}(\\omega) = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{int}}}{P_{\\mathrm{in}}} = \\frac{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{int}}\\omega^2}{\\tau_c \\omega} = \\frac{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{int}}\\omega}{\\tau_c} $$\nThis fraction must be evaluated at the specified angular velocity $\\omega_{\\mathrm{eval}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{rad\\,s^{-1}}$ using the estimated parameters $\\hat{\\gamma}_{\\mathrm{int}}$ and $\\hat{\\tau}_c$.\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{int}}(\\omega_{\\mathrm{eval}}) = \\frac{\\hat{\\gamma}_{\\mathrm{int}} \\cdot \\omega_{\\mathrm{eval}}}{\\hat{\\tau}_c} $$\n\nWe now apply this procedure to each dataset.\n\n**Dataset $1$**:\n- Given: $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ext}} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{pN\\cdot nm\\cdot s\\cdot rad^{-1}}$.\n- Data: $\\omega = [0, 5, 10, 15, 20]\\,\\mathrm{rad\\,s^{-1}}$, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{out}} = [50, 40, 30, 20, 10]\\,\\mathrm{pN\\cdot nm}$.\n- The data are perfectly linear.
