It is therefore deemed valid. A solution requires a two-step process: first, the explicit tracking of the isotopic label through the initial reactions of glycolysis, and second, the application of chemical equilibrium principles to the triose phosphate pool.\n\nPart 1: Tracking of the $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ Isotopic Label\n\nThe starting material is glucose with a $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ label exclusively at the anomeric carbon, $\\mathrm{C}1$. We denote the labeled carbon with an asterisk ($^{*}$). The initial steps of glycolysis proceed as follows:\n\n1.  **Phosphorylation**: Glucose is phosphorylated by hexokinase to yield glucose-$6$-phosphate (G6P). This reaction does not alter the carbon skeleton. The label remains at the $\\mathrm{C}1$ position.\n    $$ \\text{Glucose} ([1-^{13}\\mathrm{C}]) \\rightarrow \\text{Glucose-}6\\text{-phosphate} ([1-^{13}\\mathrm{C}]) $$\n    The structure is $\\text{HO-C}_6\\text{H}_2\\text{-}(\\text{CHOH})_3\\text{-}\\text{CH}(\\text{OPO}_3^{2-})\\text{-}\\text{C}_1\\text{H}^*\\text{O}$.\n\n2.  **Isomerization**: Phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) converts G6P, an aldose, to fructose-$6$-phosphate (F6P), a ketose. The problem states this occurs via an enediol mechanism that preserves the carbon skeleton numbering. The carbonyl group moves from $\\mathrm{C}1$ to $\\mathrm{C}2$. The label, formerly on the aldehyde carbon $\\mathrm{C}1$ of G6P, remains on the $\\mathrm{C}1$ carbon, which is now a primary alcohol in F6P.\n    $$ \\text{G6P} ([1-^{13}\\mathrm{C}]) \\rightarrow \\text{Fructose-}6\\text{-phosphate} ([1-^{13}\\mathrm{C}]) $$\n    The structure is $\\text{HO-C}_6\\text{H}_2\\text{-}(\\text{CHOH})_2\\text{-}\\text{CH}(\\text{OPO}_3^{2-})\\text{-}\\text{C}_2(=\\text{O})\\text{-}\\text{C}_1\\text{H}_2^*\\text{OH}$.\n\n3.  **Second Phosphorylation**: Phosphofructokinase (PFK) phosphorylates F6P at the $\\mathrm{C}1$ position to yield fructose-$1,6$-bisphosphate (FBP). The $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ label at $\\mathrm{C}1$ is not affected.\n    $$ \\text{F6P} ([1-^{13}\\mathrm{C}]) \\rightarrow \\text{Fructose-}1,6\\text{-bisphosphate} ([1-^{13}\\mathrm{C}]) $$\n    The structure is $\\text{P}-\\text{O}-\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_2\\text{-}(\\text{CHOH})_2\\text{-}\\text{C}_{4}\\text{HOH}-\\text{C}_3\\text{HOH}-\\text{C}_2(=\\text{O})-\\text{C}_1\\text{H}_2^*\\text{O}-\\text{P}$.\n\n4.  **Cleavage**: Aldolase cleaves the FBP molecule between carbons $\\mathrm{C}3$ and $\\mathrm{C}4$.\n    *   The fragment containing carbons $\\mathrm{C}1$, $\\mathrm{C}2$, and $\\mathrm{C}3$ of FBP becomes dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP).\n    *   The fragment containing carbons $\\mathrm{C}4$, $\\mathrm{C}5$, and $\\mathrm{C}6$ of FBP becomes glyceraldehyde-$3$-phosphate (GAP).\n\n    The carbon numbering within these new triose phosphate products preserves the order from the parent FBP molecule.\n    *   For DHAP: FBP $\\mathrm{C}1 \\rightarrow$ DHAP $\\mathrm{C}1$; FBP $\\mathrm{C}2 \\rightarrow$ DHAP $\\mathrm{C}2$; FBP $\\mathrm{C}3 \\rightarrow$ DHAP $\\mathrm{C}3$.\n    *   For GAP: FBP $\\mathrm{C}4 \\rightarrow$ GAP $\\mathrm{C}1$; FBP $\\mathrm{C}5 \\rightarrow$ GAP $\\mathrm{C}2$; FBP $\\mathrm{C}6 \\rightarrow$ GAP $\\mathrm{C}3$.\n\n    Since the $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ label is located at $\\mathrm{C}1$ of FBP, it is incorporated into the DHAP molecule. Specifically, the label resides at the $\\mathrm{C}1$ position of DHAP. The GAP molecule, formed from carbons $\\mathrm{C}4$ through $\\mathrm{C}6$ of FBP, is initially unlabeled.\n\nTherefore, immediately upon aldolase cleavage and before the action of triose phosphate isomerase (TPI), the $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ label is found exclusively at carbon $\\mathrm{C}1$ of dihydroxyacetone phosphate.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of Mole Fraction at Isotopic Steady State\n\nThe problem specifies a steady state for the triose phosphate pool, which is subject to equilibration by TPI. TPI catalyzes the reversible interconversion of DHAP and GAP.\n$$ \\text{DHAP} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{GAP} $$\nThe problem states that TPI does not exchange carbon positions. This implies that the TPI reaction interconverts labeled DHAP and labeled GAP without loss or scrambling of the label itself:\n$$ \\text{DHAP}^* (\\text{labeled at } \\mathrm{C}1) \\rightleftharpoons \\text{GAP}^* (\\text{labeled at } \\mathrm{C}1) $$\nThe equilibrium constant for the total pools is given as $K = \\frac{[\\mathrm{DHAP}]_{\\text{total}}}{[\\mathrm{GAP}]_{\\text{total}}} = 22$. As there are no isotopic effects on $K$, this same constant applies to the labeled species and the unlabeled species separately:\n$$ K = \\frac{[\\mathrm{DHAP}^*]}{[\\mathrm{GAP}^*]} = 22 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad K = \\frac{[\\mathrm{DHAP}_{\\text{unlabeled}}]}{[\\mathrm{GAP}_{\\text{unlabeled}}]} = 22 $$\nThe flux into the triose phosphate pool from each molecule of $[1-^{13}\\mathrm{C}]\\text{glucose}$ consists of one molecule of labeled DHAP ($\\text{DHAP}^*$) and one molecule of unlabeled GAP ($\\text{GAP}_{\\text{unlabeled}}$). Thus, the rate of entry of labeled molecules into the pool is equal to the rate of entry of unlabeled molecules.\n\nAt steady state, the total amount (or concentration) of labeled molecules in the pool must equal the total amount of unlabeled molecules. Let $[\\text{L}]$ be the total concentration of labeled species and $[\\text{U}]$ be the total concentration of unlabeled species.\n$$ [\\text{L}] = [\\mathrm{DHAP}^*] + [\\mathrm{GAP}^*] $$\n$$ [\\text{U}] = [\\mathrm{DHAP}_{\\text{unlabeled}}] + [\\mathrm{GAP}_{\\text{unlabeled}}] $$\nAt steady state, $[\\text{L}] = [\\text{U}]$.\n\nWe can express the concentrations of DHAP species in terms of GAP species using the equilibrium constant $K$:\n$$ [\\mathrm{DHAP}^*] = K \\cdot [\\mathrm{GAP}^*] $$\n$$ [\\mathrm{DHAP}_{\\text{unlabeled}}] = K \\cdot [\\mathrm{GAP}_{\\text{unlabeled}}] $$\nSubstituting these into the steady-state equality:\n$$ (K \\cdot [\\mathrm{GAP}^*] + [\\mathrm{GAP}^*]) = (K \\cdot [\\mathrm{GAP}_{\\text{unlabeled}}] + [\\mathrm{GAP}_{\\text{unlabeled}}]) $$\n$$ (K+1)[\\mathrm{GAP}^*] = (K+1)[\\mathrm{GAP}_{\\text{unlabeled}}] $$\nSince $K = 22$, $K+1 = 23$, which is not zero. We can therefore divide both sides by $(K+1)$:\n$$ [\\mathrm{GAP}^*] = [\\mathrm{GAP}_{\\text{unlabeled}}] $$\nThis result demonstrates that at isotopic steady state, the concentration of labeled GAP is equal to the concentration of unlabeled GAP.\n\nThe problem asks for the mole fraction, $f$, of GAP molecules that are $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$-labeled. This mole fraction is the ratio of the concentration of labeled GAP to the total concentration of GAP.\n$$ f = \\frac{[\\text{labeled GAP}]}{[\\text{total GAP}]} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{GAP}^*]}{[\\mathrm{GAP}^*] + [\\mathrm{GAP}_{\\text{unlabeled}}]} $$\nSubstituting the derived equality $[\\mathrm{GAP}_{\\text{unlabeled}}] = [\\mathrm{GAP}^*]$ into this expression gives:\n$$ f = \\frac{[\\mathrm{GAP}^*]}{[\\mathrm{GAP}^*] + [\\mathrm{GAP}^*]} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{GAP}^*]}{2 \\cdot [\\mathrm{GAP}^*]} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThe result is independent of the value of the equilibrium constant $K$, provided $K$ is a finite positive real number. The calculation relies solely on the $1:1$ stoichiometry of labeled-to-unlabeled triose phosphates produced from the initial substrate.\n\nThe question requires a numerical answer rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$ f = 0.5 $$\nExpressed to $4$ significant figures, this is $0.5000$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5000}$$", "id": "2568429"}, {"introduction": "Glycolysis is fundamentally a process of energy transduction, coupling the oxidation of glucose to the synthesis of ATP.

Use only the following foundational facts to reason from first principles:\n\n- Each molecule of glucose is split into $2$ molecules of glyceraldehyde-$3$-phosphate, so all steps after the aldol cleavage occur twice per glucose.\n- Hexokinase and phosphofructokinase each consume $1$ ATP per glucose at distinct steps in the preparatory phase.\n- The payoff phase contains exactly two substrate-level phosphorylation steps per triose: one at the conversion of $1,3$-bisphosphoglycerate to $3$-phosphoglycerate catalyzed by phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), and one at the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate catalyzed by pyruvate kinase.\n- Glyceraldehyde-$3$-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) normally incorporates inorganic phosphate into glyceraldehyde-$3$-phosphate to form a high-energy acyl phosphate intermediate that is the precursor to the PGK-coupled ATP-forming step.\n\nNow consider the presence of arsenate, $\\text{AsO}_{4}^{3-}$, which can substitute for inorganic phosphate at the GAPDH step. When arsenate is incorporated, the mixed anhydride intermediate formed is unstable and undergoes rapid hydrolysis to $3$-phosphoglycerate before PGK can act.\n\nExplain mechanistically, using the facts above, how arsenate uncouples ATP formation at the GAPDH-linked substrate-level phosphorylation step, and then calculate the resulting change in net ATP per glucose relative to arsenate-free glycolysis, assuming complete arsenate substitution at both occurrences of the GAPDH step per glucose and anaerobic conditions so that no oxidative phosphorylation contributes to ATP balance. Express the change as a signed number (decrease negative, increase positive). No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically sound and well-posed, providing a sufficient and consistent set of axioms from which a unique solution can be derived. The problem pertains directly to the topic of glycolysis and its energetic yields under specific inhibitory conditions, which is a standard topic in biochemistry. We will proceed to solve the problem from the first principles provided.\n\nFirst, we must establish the baseline net yield of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in normal anaerobic glycolysis. The process consists of an investment phase and a payoff phase.\n\n1.  **Investment Phase**: As per the provided facts, the preparatory (investment) phase consumes two molecules of ATP per molecule of glucose. One ATP is consumed by hexokinase and one by phosphofructokinase. The total investment is 2 ATP.\n\n2.  **Payoff Phase**: One molecule of glucose is cleaved to yield 2 molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). Consequently, all subsequent reactions in the payoff phase occur twice per initial glucose molecule. The problem states there are exactly two substrate-level phosphorylation steps that generate ATP in this phase:\n    *   The conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG) to 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) via phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), yielding 1 ATP per triose.\n    *   The conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate via pyruvate kinase, yielding 1 ATP per triose.\n\n    For each of the 2 triose molecules, 2 ATP are generated (1+1). Therefore, the total ATP production in the payoff phase per glucose molecule is $2 \\times 2 = 4$ ATP.\n\n3.  **Net Yield (Normal)**: The net yield is the total ATP generated minus the total ATP invested.\n    $$Net~ATP_{\\text{normal}} = 4~ATP - 2~ATP = 2~ATP$$\n    Thus, under normal anaerobic conditions, there is a net gain of 2 ATP per molecule of glucose.\n\nNext, we analyze the mechanism of arsenate ($\\text{AsO}_{4}^{3-}$) uncoupling.\nArsenate is a structural analog of inorganic phosphate ($\\mathrm{P_i}$) and can act as a substrate for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The normal GAPDH reaction is:\n$$\\text{G3P} + \\mathrm{NAD}^+ + \\mathrm{P_i} \\rightarrow 1,3\\text{-BPG} + \\text{NADH} + \\text{H}^+$$\nThe product, 1,3-BPG, possesses a high-energy acyl phosphate bond at the C-1 position. The energy of this bond is captured by PGK to synthesize ATP.\n\nWhen arsenate is present, it substitutes for $\\mathrm{P_i}$, and GAPDH catalyzes the formation of 1-arseno-3-phosphoglycerate:\n$$\\text{G3P} + \\mathrm{NAD}^+ + \\text{AsO}_{4}^{3-} \\rightarrow 1\\text{-arseno-}3\\text{-phosphoglycerate} + \\text{NADH} + \\text{H}^+$$\nThe problem states that this acyl-arsenate mixed anhydride is unstable and undergoes rapid, spontaneous hydrolysis:\n$$1\\text{-arseno-}3\\text{-phosphoglycerate} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow 3\\text{-PG} + \\text{AsO}_{4}^{3-} + \\text{H}^+$$\nThis hydrolysis directly yields 3-PG, the product of the PGK reaction, but does so without the involvement of PGK and, crucially, without the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. The energy that would have been conserved in the ATP molecule is instead dissipated as heat. This process is termed uncoupling because the oxidation of the aldehyde is no longer coupled to ATP formation. The PGK step is effectively bypassed.\n\nFinally, we calculate the change in net ATP yield.\n1.  **Investment Phase (with Arsenate)**: This phase is unaffected. The investment remains 2 ATP.\n\n2.  **Payoff Phase (with Arsenate)**: Since the PGK step is bypassed for both triose phosphate molecules, the 2 ATP (one for each triose) that would have been generated at this step are lost. The pyruvate kinase step is unaffected and still generates 2 ATP per glucose (1 ATP for each of the two trioses). The total ATP production in the payoff phase is therefore $0~ATP_{\\text{from PGK}} + 2~ATP_{\\text{from PyK}} = 2$ ATP.\n\n3.  **Net Yield (with Arsenate)**: The net ATP yield in the presence of arsenate is:\n    $$Net~ATP_{\\text{arsenate}} = 2~ATP - 2~ATP = 0~ATP$$\n    Glycolysis proceeds, but there is no net energy gain in the form of ATP.\n\nThe change in net ATP per glucose is the yield with arsenate minus the normal yield:\n$$\\Delta\\text{Net ATP} = Net~ATP_{\\text{arsenate}} - Net~ATP_{\\text{normal}} = 0 - 2 = -2$$\nThe presence of arsenate causes a net decrease of 2 ATP molecules per glucose.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-2}$$", "id": "2568511"}, {"introduction": "While we often speak of a single \"rate-limiting step,\" the control of flux in a metabolic pathway is typically distributed across multiple enzymes.
