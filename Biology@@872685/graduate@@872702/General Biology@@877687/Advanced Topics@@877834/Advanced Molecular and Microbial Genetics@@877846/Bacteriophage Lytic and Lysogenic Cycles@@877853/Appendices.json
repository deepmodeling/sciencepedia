By analyzing the predicted effects of deleting the $O_R3$ operator, you will develop a deeper intuition for how negative autoregulation contributes to the homeostasis, dynamic range, and stability of the lysogenic state.", "problem": "A canonical double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) regulatory module in bacteriophage lambda comprises three operator sites, $O_R1$, $O_R2$, and $O_R3$, that overlap two divergent promoters, $P_R$ (lytic transcription) and $P_{RM}$ (the maintenance promoter for the lambda repressor). The lambda repressor protein (CI; encoded by the $cI$ gene) binds with highest intrinsic affinity to $O_R1$, next to $O_R2$, and lowest to $O_R3$, and exhibits cooperative interactions between $O_R1$ and $O_R2$. Occupancy of $O_R1$ and $O_R2$ by $CI$ represses $P_R$ and activates $P_{RM}$ through protein–protein contacts with ribonucleic acid polymerase (RNAP). At elevated $[CI]$, binding to $O_R3$ represses $P_{RM}$ (negative autoregulation) by occluding RNAP binding. The Cro protein ($Cro$) binds $O_R3$ with relatively high affinity and represses $P_{RM}$ early during lytic growth.\n\nConsider a quasi-equilibrium thermodynamic promoter-occupancy framework in which the probability that $P_{RM}$ is transcriptionally active, $P_{\\text{on}}(P_{RM})$, is proportional to a sum over statistical weights of microstates in which RNAP is bound to $P_{RM}$ and not sterically occluded by operator occupancy. Each microstate has statistical weight proportional to $\\exp(-\\beta \\Delta G_{\\text{state}})$ multiplied by appropriate powers of free concentrations (for example $[CI]^n$) reflecting the number $n$ of bound repressors, with $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is absolute temperature. Assume cooperative interactions between $CI$ at $O_R1$ and $O_R2$ lower the free energy of states containing both sites occupied, thereby enhancing $P_{RM}$ activation, and that $CI$ occupancy of $O_R3$ disallows RNAP at $P_{RM}$.\n\nNow imagine a mutant in which the $O_R3$ site is deleted (precisely removing the $CI$ and $Cro$ binding site without altering $O_R1$, $O_R2$, or core promoter sequences). Using promoter occupancy arguments as above, reason qualitatively about how this deletion changes:\n- the functional dependence of $P_{RM}$-driven $CI$ expression on $[CI]$, especially its maximal level and whether it remains monotonic versus $[CI]$;\n- the dynamic range of $CI$ expression (interpreted as the ratio of maximal to minimal $P_{RM}$ output over the range of $[CI]$ that is physiologically accessible in the lysogenic state);\n- the switch’s susceptibility to induction into the lytic cycle by perturbations that transiently reduce $[CI]$ (for example, self-cleavage of $CI$ upon DNA damage), in terms of how easily the system can cross the threshold at which $P_R$ is derepressed and $P_{RM}$ fails to maintain $CI$.\n\nWhich statement best captures the predicted effects of the $O_R3$ deletion?\n\nA. Deleting $O_R3$ removes negative autoregulation, making $P_{RM}$ activation by $CI$ a monotonic nondecreasing function of $[CI]$ that saturates at a higher maximal level; the dynamic range of $CI$ expression increases; the lysogenic state becomes less susceptible to induction because a larger decrement in $[CI]$ is required to drop $P_{RM}$ output below maintenance.\n\nB. Deleting $O_R3$ removes positive feedback, making $P_{RM}$ activation by $CI$ a monotonic decreasing function of $[CI]$; the dynamic range of $CI$ expression decreases; the lysogenic state becomes more susceptible to induction because $P_{RM}$ is more easily shut off.\n\nC. Deleting $O_R3$ removes negative autoregulation, increasing the maximal $P_{RM}$ output, but this also increases susceptibility to induction because higher $P_{RM}$ causes larger noise; overall the dynamic range increases while the lysogenic state becomes more easily induced.\n\nD. Deleting $O_R3$ does not alter the shape of $P_{RM}$ versus $[CI]$ because $O_R3$ is a low-affinity site; the dynamic range is unchanged; the susceptibility to induction is unchanged.", "solution": "The analysis will proceed by first characterizing the wild-type system and then the mutant system, based on the provided thermodynamic framework. The rate of $CI$ expression is proportional to the probability that the $P_{RM}$ promoter is active, denoted $P_{\\text{on}}(P_{RM})$.\n\n**1. Wild-Type ($WT$) System Behavior**\n\nThe activity of the $P_{RM}$ promoter is a function of the concentration of the CI repressor, $[CI]$.\n- At very low $[CI]$ (near $[CI] \\approx 0$), the operators are unoccupied. $P_{RM}$ is a weak promoter with low basal activity.\n- As $[CI]$ increases, CI begins to occupy the highest affinity site, $O_R1$. Due to cooperativity, this facilitates the binding of a second CI dimer to $O_R2$. The problem states that \"Occupancy of $O_R1$ and $O_R2$ by $CI$ ... activates $P_{RM}$\". This positive feedback causes $P_{\\text{on}}(P_{RM})$ to increase with $[CI]$.\n- At elevated $[CI]$, CI begins to occupy the lowest affinity site, $O_R3$. The problem states that binding to $O_R3$ \"represses $P_{RM}$... by occluding RNAP binding\". This constitutes a negative autoregulatory loop.\n- The combination of these effects results in a non-monotonic relationship between $P_{\\text{on}}(P_{RM})$ and $[CI]$. The function initially rises due to activation via $O_R1/O_R2$ binding, reaches a maximum, and then decreases at high $[CI]$ due to repression via $O_R3$ binding. This produces a characteristic bell-shaped response curve. The stable lysogenic state is maintained at a $[CI]$ value near the peak of this curve, where a homeostatic effect is achieved: if $[CI]$ increases slightly, $P_{RM}$ activity drops, reducing CI production; if $[CI]$ decreases slightly (while remaining on the right side of the peak), $P_{RM}$ activity rises, increasing CI production.\n\n**2. Mutant ($\\Delta O_R3$) System Behavior**\n\nNow consider the mutant where the $O_R3$ site is deleted.\n- The deletion of $O_R3$ physically removes the site responsible for negative autoregulation at high $[CI]$. The repressive action of CI on $P_{RM}$ is eliminated.\n- The activation machinery remains intact. CI can still bind to $O_R1$ and $O_R2$, activating transcription from $P_{RM}$.\n- Consequently, as $[CI]$ increases from zero, $P_{\\text{on}}(P_{RM})$ will increase due to cooperative binding at $O_R1/O_R2$. However, unlike the wild-type, it will not decrease at higher $[CI]$. Instead, the activity will continue to rise until it reaches a saturation point, where $O_R1$ and $O_R2$ are fully occupied and the promoter is maximally activated.\n- The functional dependence of $P_{RM}$ on $[CI]$ changes from a non-monotonic, bell-shaped curve to a monotonic, nondecreasing sigmoidal (saturating) curve.\n\n**3. Answering the Specific Questions**\n\n- **Functional Dependence and Maximal Level**: The function $P_{\\text{on}}(P_{RM})$ versus $[CI]$ becomes monotonic nondecreasing. The maximal level of $P_{RM}$ activity in the mutant will be higher than the peak activity in the wild-type. This is because the wild-type peak is a balance between activation and incipient repression, whereas the mutant's maximum is limited only by the saturation of the activation mechanism.\n- **Dynamic Range**: The dynamic range can be defined as the ratio of maximal to minimal $P_{RM}$ output, $P_{\\text{on}}^{\\text{max}} / P_{\\text{on}}^{\\text{min}}$. The minimal output, $P_{\\text{on}}^{\\text{min}}$, corresponding to the basal activity at $[CI]=0$, is unchanged. Since the maximal output, $P_{\\text{on}}^{\\text{max}}$, is higher in the mutant, the dynamic range is increased.\n- **Susceptibility to Induction**: Induction into the lytic cycle occurs when $[CI]$ drops below a critical threshold, leading to derepression of $P_R$. The stability of the lysogen is its ability to resist such a drop. In the wild-type, the negative feedback loop maintains $[CI]$ within a specific, optimal range. In the $\\Delta O_R3$ mutant, the absence of negative feedback means that the stable steady state of the lysogen will occur at a much higher $[CI]$, corresponding to the saturation of the $P_{RM}$ promoter. To induce the lytic cycle (i.e., to deplete CI below the switching threshold), a much larger or more prolonged perturbation (such as CI cleavage) is required to overcome this significantly larger reservoir of CI protein. Therefore, the lysogenic state becomes more stable, or *less* susceptible to induction.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n- **A. Deleting $O_R3$ removes negative autoregulation, making $P_{RM}$ activation by $CI$ a monotonic nondecreasing function of $[CI]$ that saturates at a higher maximal level; the dynamic range of $CI$ expression increases; the lysogenic state becomes less susceptible to induction because a larger decrement in $[CI]$ is required to drop $P_{RM}$ output below maintenance.**\nThis statement is a precise summary of our derived conclusions. Each point is correct: removal of negative autoregulation, change to monotonic function, higher maximum, increased dynamic range, and decreased susceptibility to induction (increased stability).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. Deleting $O_R3$ removes positive feedback, making $P_{RM}$ activation by $CI$ a monotonic decreasing function of $[CI]$; the dynamic range of $CI$ expression decreases; the lysogenic state becomes more susceptible to induction because $P_{RM}$ is more easily shut off.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. Deleting $O_R3$ removes *negative* feedback, not positive feedback. The resulting function is monotonic *increasing* (nondecreasing), not decreasing. All subsequent conclusions are based on these incorrect premises.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. Deleting $O_R3$ removes negative autoregulation, increasing the maximal $P_{RM}$ output, but this also increases susceptibility to induction because higher $P_{RM}$ causes larger noise; overall the dynamic range increases while the lysogenic state becomes more easily induced.**\nThis statement correctly identifies the removal of negative autoregulation and the increase in maximal output and dynamic range. However, it incorrectly concludes that susceptibility to induction *increases*. The reasoning provided (\"larger noise\") is a secondary effect that is overwhelmed by the primary effect of a much larger steady-state concentration of CI, which acts as a buffer. The dominant effect is increased stability.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. Deleting $O_R3$ does not alter the shape of $P_{RM}$ versus $[CI]$ because $O_R3$ is a low-affinity site; the dynamic range is unchanged; the susceptibility to induction is unchanged.**\nThis statement misunderstands the role of the low-affinity $O_R3$ site. Its low affinity is precisely what allows it to function as a sensor for high concentrations of CI, thereby mediating negative autoregulation and creating the non-monotonic shape. Deleting it fundamentally alters the curve's shape. Consequently, the dynamic range and stability are also altered.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThe only option that is fully consistent with a rigorous analysis of the lambda switch model is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2477681"}]}
