By completing this practice, you will derive the universal rule that all icosahedral capsids built on the principle of quasi-equivalence must contain exactly 12 pentameric capsomeres, a cornerstone of modern structural virology.", "problem": "An unenveloped icosahedral virion is modeled as a triangulated spherical surface with triangulation number $T$, following the quasi-equivalence framework. It contains $60T$ identical capsid protein subunits. The morphological capsomeres are symmetric oligomeric units that are either pentamers composed of $5$ subunits or hexamers composed of $6$ subunits. The spatial arrangement of capsomeres on the capsid surface can be idealized as a closed convex polyhedral tiling of the sphere by pentagonal and hexagonal faces, with exactly $3$ faces meeting at each vertex. Using only the topological identity for a sphere $V - E + F = 2$, where $V$ is the number of vertices, $E$ is the number of edges, and $F$ is the number of faces, together with the above biological facts, derive the general expressions that relate the numbers of pentamers and hexamers to $T$.

Consider the spherical tiling by pentagons and hexagons that represents the capsomere arrangement. In such a tiling, exactly $3$ faces meet at each vertex, so each vertex is incident to $3$ faces. If $V$ is the number of vertices and $E$ the number of edges, then each edge is shared by $2$ faces and each vertex is shared by $3$ faces. Therefore, counting incidences gives two standard relations:\n- Counting face-edge incidences: $5P + 6H = 2E$.\n- Counting face-vertex incidences: $3V = 2E$.\n\nWe also have Euler’s characteristic for the sphere,\n$$\nV - E + F = 2.\n$$\nUsing $3V = 2E$, we write $V = \\frac{2E}{3}$. Substitute this into Euler’s identity:\n$$\n\\frac{2E}{3} - E + (P + H) = 2.\n$$\nThis simplifies to\n$$\n-\\frac{E}{3} + P + H = 2 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad E = 3\\bigl((P + H) - 2\\bigr).\n$$\nNow use the face-edge incidence relation $5P + 6H = 2E$ and substitute $E$:\n$$\n5P + 6H = 2 \\cdot 3\\bigl((P + H) - 2\\bigr) = 6(P + H - 2).\n$$\nExpand and rearrange:\n$$\n5P + 6H = 6P + 6H - 12 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad 5P = 6P - 12 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad P = 12.\n$$\nThus, independently of $T$, there are exactly $12$ pentameric capsomeres. Next, use conservation of subunits. The total number of protein subunits in an icosahedral capsid with triangulation number $T$ is $60T$. Each pentamer contains $5$ subunits and each hexamer $6$ subunits, so\n$$\n5P + 6H = 60T.\n$$\nWith $P = 12$, we have\n$$\n5 \\cdot 12 + 6H = 60T \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad 60 + 6H = 60T \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad H = 10(T - 1).\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nF = P + H = 12 + 10(T - 1) = 10T + 2.\n$$\nFor $T = 7$, compute\n$$\nP = 12, \\quad H = 10(7 - 1) = 60, \\quad F = 10 \\cdot 7 + 2 = 72.\n$$\nAs a consistency check, the total number of subunits is $5P + 6H = 5 \\cdot 12 + 6 \\cdot 60 = 60 + 360 = 420$, which matches $60T = 60 \\cdot 7 = 420$.

This falls under the domain of Hertzian contact theory, which is built upon the principles of linear elasticity, geometric compatibility, and force balance for small, frictionless, non-adhesive deformations.\n\nLet the two contacting bodies be indexed as $1$ (the virus) and $2$ (the AFM tip). They are characterized by their radii ($R_1 = R_{\\mathrm{v}}$, $R_2 = R_{\\mathrm{p}}$), Young's moduli ($E_1 = E$, $E_2 = E_{\\mathrm{p}}$), and Poisson's ratios ($\\nu_1 = \\nu$, $\\nu_2 = \\nu_{\\mathrm{p}}$).\n\nThe core of Hertz theory lies in relating the geometry of contact to the elastic response of the materials.\n1.  **Geometric Compatibility**: For small indentations ($\\delta \\ll R_1, R_2$), the contact creates a circular patch of radius $a$. The relationship between the indentation depth $\\delta$, the contact radius $a$, and the effective radius of curvature $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is purely geometric:\n    $$ \\delta = \\frac{a^2}{R_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$$\n    The effective radius $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is defined by the curvature of the two contacting surfaces:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} = \\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{v}}} + \\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{p}}} $$\n\n2.  **Elastic Response and Force Balance**: The pressure distribution $p(r)$ over the circular contact area (where $r$ is the radial distance from the center of contact) is found from elasticity theory to be semi-ellipsoidal:\n    $$ p(r) = p_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^2} $$\n    where $p_0$ is the maximum pressure at the center ($r=0$).

It shows the characteristic scaling $F \\propto \\delta^{3/2}$ observed in the experiment.\n\nThe problem states that the experimental data fit the relation $F = \\alpha \\delta^{3/2}$, where $\\alpha$ is a fitted prefactor. By comparing this with our derived equation, we find the explicit relationship between $\\alpha$ and the system parameters:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{4}{3} E^* \\sqrt{R_{\\mathrm{eff}}} $$\n\nNow we must apply the specific conditions of the problem. We are given that the AFM tip is made of diamond and is much stiffer than the virus. This implies $E_{\\mathrm{p}} \\gg E$.
