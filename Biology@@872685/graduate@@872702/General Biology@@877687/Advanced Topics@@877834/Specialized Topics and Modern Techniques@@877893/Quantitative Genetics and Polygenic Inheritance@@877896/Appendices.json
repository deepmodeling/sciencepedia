By calculating the broad-sense heritability ($H^2$), you will quantify the total genetic contribution to variation in a trait, a crucial baseline for any breeding program or evolutionary study.

They quantify the total observed variation, known as the total phenotypic variance ($V_P$), and find it to be $42.5 \\ (\\text{mg/g})^2$.\n\nTo isolate the effect of environmental factors, the researchers then grow a set of genetically identical plants (clones) in the same field conditions.

Under the standard decomposition of phenotypic variance into genetic and environmental components, the following variance components have been estimated from a properly designed breeding experiment with no genotype-by-environment interaction and no genotype-environment covariance: additive genetic variance $V_{A} = 0.40$, dominance genetic variance $V_{D} = 0.10$, additive-by-additive epistatic variance $V_{AA} = 0.05$, and environmental variance $V_{E} = 0.45$.

No rounding is necessary.", "solution": "The problem presented is a standard exercise in quantitative genetics. A validation of its premises confirms that it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains all necessary data for a unique solution and is free from internal contradictions or logical flaws. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for three tasks to be completed based on a given set of variance components for a quantitative trait in a randomly mating population. The components are: additive genetic variance $V_{A} = 0.40$, dominance genetic variance $V_{D} = 0.10$, additive-by-additive epistatic variance $V_{AA} = 0.05$, and environmental variance $V_{E} = 0.45$. It is also stated that there is no genotype-by-environment interaction and no genotype-environment covariance.\n\n1. Derivation of total phenotypic variance, $V_{P}$.\n\nThe total phenotypic variance, $V_{P}$, of a trait is decomposed into its causal components. The fundamental model is:\n$$V_{P} = V_{G} + V_{E} + V_{G \\times E} + 2\\text{Cov}(G, E)$$\nwhere $V_{G}$ is the total genetic variance, $V_{E}$ is the environmental variance, $V_{G \\times E}$ is the variance due to interaction between genotype and environment, and $\\text{Cov}(G, E)$ is the covariance between genotypic and environmental effects.\n\nThe problem statement specifies that $V_{G \\times E} = 0$ and $\\text{Cov}(G, E) = 0$. Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n$$V_{P} = V_{G} + V_{E}$$\nThe total genetic variance, $V_{G}$, is the sum of the variances of its components. The genotypic value ($G$) is decomposed as $G = A + D + I$, where $A$ is the additive genetic value (breeding value), $D$ is the dominance deviation, and $I$ is the epistatic (interaction) deviation. Assuming these components are uncorrelated, the genetic variance is:\n$$V_{G} = V_{A} + V_{D} + V_{I}$$\nwhere $V_{A}$ is the additive genetic variance, $V_{D}$ is the dominance genetic variance, and $V_{I}$ is the epistatic variance. The epistatic variance can be further decomposed into components such as additive-by-additive ($V_{AA}$), additive-by-dominance ($V_{AD}$), and so on. The problem provides a value for $V_{AA}$ and no other epistatic components. We must assume that other components of $V_{I}$ are zero or negligible, so we take $V_{I} \\approx V_{AA}$.\n\nUsing the given values:\n$V_{A} = 0.40$\n$V_{D} = 0.10$\n$V_{AA} = 0.05$\n\nThe total genetic variance is calculated as:\n$$V_{G} = V_{A} + V_{D} + V_{AA} = 0.40 + 0.10 + 0.05 = 0.55$$\nNow, we can compute the total phenotypic variance using the given environmental variance, $V_{E} = 0.45$:\n$$V_{P} = V_{G} + V_{E} = 0.55 + 0.45 = 1.00$$\nThe total phenotypic variance is $V_{P} = 1.00$.\n\n2. Definition and computation of heritabilities.\n\nBroad-sense heritability, $H^{2}$, is defined as the proportion of the total phenotypic variance that is attributable to all genetic differences among individuals. It is the ratio of the total genetic variance to the total phenotypic variance:\n$$H^{2} = \\frac{V_{G}}{V_{P}}$$\nUsing the values derived above:\n$$H^{2} = \\frac{0.55}{1.00} = 0.55$$\n\nNarrow-sense heritability, $h^{2}$, is defined as the proportion of the total phenotypic variance that is attributable only to additive genetic variance. The additive variance is the component of genetic variance responsible for the resemblance between parents and offspring.\n$$h^{2} = \\frac{V_{A}}{V_{P}}$$\nUsing the given and derived values:\n$$h^{2} = \\frac{0.40}{1.00} = 0.40$$\n\n3. Reasoning for predictor of selection response.\n\nThe response to selection ($R$) is the change in the mean phenotype of a population from one generation to the next as a result of selection. The magnitude of this response is predicted by the Breeder's Equation, $R = h^{2}S$, where $S$ is the selection differential (the difference between the mean of the selected parents and the mean of the entire parental generation). To understand why $h^{2}$, and not $H^{2}$, is the correct predictor, we must examine the basis of resemblance between relatives from first principles.\n\nIn a sexually reproducing diploid population, each parent passes a random half of its alleles to an offspring. The phenotype of an individual ($P$) is a function of its genotype ($G$) and its environment ($E$), so $P = G + E$. The genotypic value $G$ is itself a sum of the additive or breeding value ($A$), dominance deviation ($D$), and epistatic deviation ($I$).\n\nThe breeding value, $A$, is defined as the sum of the average effects of the alleles an individual carries. Because an individual passes on its alleles, not its full genotype, to its progeny, it is the breeding value that determines the mean genotypic value of its offspring. Specifically, the expected breeding value of an offspring is the average of the parental breeding values: $E[A_{offspring}] = \\frac{1}{2}(A_{parent1} + A_{parent2})$.\n\nDominance deviation, $D$, arises from the interaction between alleles at a single locus. A specific combination of two alleles (e.g., $A_{1}A_{2}$) might produce a certain dominance effect. However, a parent transmits only one allele from this pair to an offspring. The dominance effect in the parent is therefore broken up during meiosis and is not transmitted.\n\nEpistatic deviation, $I$, arises from interactions between alleles at different loci. These non-additive interactions are also disrupted by segregation and recombination during meiosis. Therefore, like dominance effects, epistatic effects are generally not passed on from parent to offspring in a predictable manner under random mating.\n\nThe quantitative measure of parent-offspring resemblance is the covariance of their phenotypes. Let us consider the regression of an offspring's phenotype, $P_O$, on the average phenotype of its two parents (the mid-parent value), $P_{MP} = (P_{1} + P_{2}) / 2$. The slope of this regression is a direct measure of heritability.\n$$b_{O,MP} = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(P_{O}, P_{MP})}{\\text{Var}(P_{MP})}$$\nThe covariance term is $\\text{Cov}(A_O + D_O + I_O + E_O, A_{MP} + D_{MP} + I_{MP} + E_{MP})$. Ignoring environmental covariances and covariances with non-additive terms, this simplifies to $\\text{Cov}(A_O, A_{MP})$.\nGiven $A_O = \\frac{1}{2}A_1 + \\frac{1}{2}A_2$, we have $\\text{Cov}(A_O, A_{MP}) = \\text{Cov}(\\frac{1}{2}(A_1+A_2), \\frac{1}{2}(A_1+A_2)) = \\frac{1}{4}\\text{Var}(A_1+A_2)$. If parents are unrelated, $\\text{Var}(A_1+A_2) = V_A + V_A = 2V_A$. So, $\\text{Cov}(A_O, A_{MP}) = \\frac{1}{2}V_A$.\nThe variance of the mid-parent value is $\\text{Var}(P_{MP}) = \\text{Var}(\\frac{P_1+P_2}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}(\\text{Var}(P_1)+\\text{Var}(P_2)) = \\frac{1}{4}(V_P+V_P) = \\frac{1}{2}V_P$.\nTherefore, the regression slope is:\n$$b_{O,MP} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}V_{A}}{\\frac{1}{2}V_{P}} = \\frac{V_{A}}{V_{P}} = h^{2}$$\nThis result formally demonstrates that the degree to which an offspring's phenotype resembles its parents' phenotypes is determined by the proportion of phenotypic variance that is additive genetic variance, i.e., the narrow-sense heritability $h^{2}$.\n\nSince the response to selection depends directly on the degree to which parental superiority is transmitted to offspring, it is $h^{2}$ that governs the predictable change across generations. Broad-sense heritability, $H^{2}$, includes variance from non-additive genetic effects ($V_D$ and $V_I$) which are not faithfully transmitted from parent to offspring in sexually reproducing populations. Therefore, $H^{2}$ overestimates the potential evolutionary response to selection and is not the appropriate predictive quantity. The correct predictor is the narrow-sense heritability, $h^{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.40 & 0.55 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2831007"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical concepts like additive genetic variance become powerful tools when we can estimate them from real-world data.
