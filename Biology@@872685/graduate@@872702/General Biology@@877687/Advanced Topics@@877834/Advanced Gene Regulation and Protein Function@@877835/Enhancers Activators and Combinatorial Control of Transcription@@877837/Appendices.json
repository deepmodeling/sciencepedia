A rigorous solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to determine the fold-change in the transcription initiation rate, $\\frac{r}{r_0}$, based on an equilibrium binding model.\n\nFirst, we must derive the expression for the fractional occupancy, $f$. The fractional occupancy is defined as the ratio of the concentration of bound sites, $[AS]$, to the total concentration of sites, $[S]_T$:\n$$f = \\frac{[AS]}{[S]_T}$$\nThe total concentration of sites is the sum of free sites, $[S]$, and bound sites, $[AS]$:\n$$[S]_T = [S] + [AS]$$\nThe binding reaction $A + S \\rightleftharpoons AS$ is governed by the dissociation constant, $K_d$:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[A][S]}{[AS]}$$\nwhere $[A]$ represents the concentration of the free activator. We can rearrange this equilibrium expression to solve for the concentration of free sites, $[S]$:\n$$[S] = \\frac{K_d [AS]}{[A]}$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[S]$ into the conservation equation for the total sites:\n$$[S]_T = \\frac{K_d [AS]}{[A]} + [AS]$$\nTo find an expression for $f$, we can factor out $[AS]$ from the right-hand side:\n$$[S]_T = [AS] \\left( \\frac{K_d}{[A]} + 1 \\right) = [AS] \\left( \\frac{K_d + [A]}{[A]} \\right)$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for the ratio $\\frac{[AS]}{[S]_T}$ gives the fractional occupancy $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{[AS]}{[S]_T} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d + [A]}{[A]}} = \\frac{[A]}{[A] + K_d}$$\nThis is the well-known Langmuir-Hill equation for non-cooperative binding ($n=1$).\n\nWith the derived expression for $f$, we can now substitute the given parameter values: $K_d = 10\\,\\text{nM}$ and $[A] = 30\\,\\text{nM}$.\n$$f = \\frac{30\\,\\text{nM}}{30\\,\\text{nM} + 10\\,\\text{nM}} = \\frac{30}{40} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\n\nNext, we analyze the transcriptional output.

It is well-posed and grounded in the standard principles of statistical thermodynamics as applied to gene regulation, specifically the Shea-Ackers model. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system is a single promoter sequence with two non-overlapping binding sites: one for an activator protein, $A$, and one for RNA polymerase, $P$. The system can exist in one of four possible microstates. We must determine the statistical weight of each microstate relative to the empty state, which is assigned a weight of $1$ by convention. The statistical weights are derived from the law of mass action at thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\nThe dissociation constant for the activator, $K_A$, is defined for the reaction $D + A \\rightleftharpoons DA$, where $D$ is the free promoter site and $DA$ is the promoter with the activator bound. At equilibrium, $K_A = \\frac{[D][A]}{[DA]}$, where $[...]$ denotes concentration. The concentration of the activator-bound state is thus $[DA] = \\frac{[A]}{K_A}[D]$. The statistical weight of this state, relative to the empty state $D$, is therefore $\\frac{[A]}{K_A}$.\n\nSimilarly, the dissociation constant for RNA polymerase, $K_P$, is for the reaction $D + P \\rightleftharpoons DP$. At equilibrium, $K_P = \\frac{[D][P]}{[DP]}$. The concentration of the polymerase-bound state is $[DP] = \\frac{[P]}{K_P}[D]$.

The doubly-bound state, where both the activator and RNAP are bound. If the binding events were independent, the weight would be the product of the individual weights, $w_A w_P$. However, the problem specifies a cooperative interaction, represented by a dimensionless factor $\\omega$. This factor multiplies the statistical weight of the doubly-bound state. Thus, the statistical weight is $w_{AP} = \\omega \\left(\\frac{[A]}{K_A}\\right) \\left(\\frac{[P]}{K_P}\\right) = \\omega \\frac{[A][P]}{K_A K_P}$.\n\nThe partition function, $Z$, is the sum of the statistical weights of all possible microstates of the system.\n$$Z = w_{\\text{empty}} + w_A + w_P + w_{AP}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the weights:\n$$Z = 1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_A} + \\frac{[P]}{K_P} + \\omega \\frac{[A][P]}{K_A K_P}$$\n\nThe probability of any particular macroscopic state is the sum of the statistical weights of the microstates comprising that macro-state, divided by the total partition function $Z$. We are asked to find the probability that RNAP is bound to the promoter, $p_{\\text{RNAP}}$. RNAP is bound in two of the microstates: the state where only RNAP is bound ($w_P$) and the state where both RNAP and the activator are bound ($w_{AP}$).\n\nTherefore, the numerator for our probability calculation is the sum of the weights of these two states:\n$$\\text{Sum of weights for RNAP-bound states} = w_P + w_{AP} = \\frac{[P]}{K_P} + \\omega \\frac{[A][P]}{K_A K_P}$$\n\nThe probability $p_{\\text{RNAP}}$ is this sum divided by the partition function $Z$:\n$$p_{\\text{RNAP}} = \\frac{w_P + w_{AP}}{Z} = \\frac{\\frac{[P]}{K_P} + \\omega \\frac{[A][P]}{K_A K_P}}{1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_A} + \\frac{[P]}{K_P} + \\omega \\frac{[A][P]}{K_A K_P}}$$\n\nThis expression is the complete and correct solution.
