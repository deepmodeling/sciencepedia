Round your final answer to three significant figures and express it in millidegrees.", "solution": "The problem presented is judged to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of biophysical chemistry, specifically circular dichroism spectroscopy of polypeptides. All necessary parameters are provided, the terminology is precise, and the question is well-posed, asking for both a qualitative explanation and a quantitative calculation based on established models.\n\nThe problem is addressed in two parts as required.\n\nPart 1: Conceptual Explanation of Far-UV Circular Dichroism\n\nCircular Dichroism (CD) is the differential absorption of left- and right-circularly polarized light, $\\Delta A = A_L - A_R$. A molecule or system is CD-active only if it is chiral. The fundamental chromophore in the far-ultraviolet region ($190\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ to $250\\ \\mathrm{nm}$) for a protein is the peptide (amide) bond. The peptide bond itself, being planar, is achiral. However, it exhibits two primary electronic transitions in this spectral region: a lower-energy, weak $n \\to \\pi^*$ transition around $220\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ and a higher-energy, strong $\\pi \\to \\pi^*$ transition around $190\\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nThe CD activity of the peptide backbone arises from two sources. First, the peptide bond exists in a chiral environment due to its covalent linkage to the asymmetric $\\alpha$-carbon (C$_\\alpha$) of the L-amino acid residues. This asymmetric perturbation imparts a weak, intrinsic chirality to the peptide bond's electronic transitions. In a disordered, or statistical coil, conformation, the peptide is a mixture of many rapidly interconverting conformers. The orientations of the peptide bonds are largely random with respect to one another. The resulting CD spectrum is an ensemble average, characterized by a weak negative band near $200\\ \\mathrm{nm}$, reflecting this local, intrinsic chirality.\n\nThe situation changes drastically upon the formation of ordered secondary structures, such as the $\\alpha$-helix or $\\beta$-sheet. In these structures, the peptide bonds are no longer randomly oriented but are arranged in a fixed, regular, and chiral geometry. For an $\\alpha$-helix, the peptide bonds spiral in a right-handed fashion along the helical axis. This spatial proximity and regular orientation of identical chromophores leads to a phenomenon called **chiral exciton coupling**.\n\nExciton coupling originates from the through-space dipole-dipole interaction between the transition dipole moments of the individual peptide bonds. According to molecular exciton theory, this interaction lifts the degeneracy of the excited states of the chromophores. For the strong $\\pi \\to \\pi^*$ transition, the coupling causes it to split into two distinct exciton bands: a negative band polarized along the helix axis (observed near $208\\ \\mathrm{nm}$) and a positive band polarized perpendicular to the axis (observed near $192\\ \\mathrm{nm}$). The weaker $n \\to \\pi^*$ transition does not couple as strongly but is positioned in a highly defined chiral environment within the helix, giving rise to a distinct negative CD band at approximately $222\\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nConsequently, the CD spectrum of an $\\alpha$-helix is highly characteristic, showing two negative minima at approximately $222\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ and $208\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ and a positive maximum around $192\\ \\mathrm{nm}$. For other structures, like the $\\beta$-sheet, a different regular geometry results in a different exciton coupling pattern and a distinct spectrum (e.g., a negative band near $217\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ and a positive band near $195\\ \\mathrm{nm}$).\n\nIn summary, far-ultraviolet CD reports on protein secondary structure because the formation of ordered, periodic structures generates strong, characteristic CD signals via chiral exciton coupling of the peptide backbone electronic transitions. The absence of such long-range order in a statistical coil results in the absence of exciton coupling and a much weaker, non-distinctive CD spectrum. The magnitude and shape of the CD spectrum are therefore a direct measure of the type and amount of secondary structure present.\n\nPart 2: Quantitative Calculation\n\nThe objective is to calculate the change in the observed ellipticity, $\\Delta\\theta_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, at $\\lambda = 222\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ when the peptide transitions from an initial to a final state.\n$$ \\Delta\\theta_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\theta_{\\mathrm{obs, final}} - \\theta_{\\mathrm{obs, init}} $$\nThe observed ellipticity, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ (in degrees), is related to the mean residue ellipticity, $\\left[\\theta\\right]_{\\mathrm{MR}}$ (in $\\mathrm{deg\\ cm^{2}\\ dmol^{-1}}$), by the following equation:\n$$ \\theta_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\left[\\theta\\right]_{\\mathrm{MR}} \\times C \\times l $$\nwhere $l$ is the path length in $\\mathrm{cm}$ and $C$ is the mean residue concentration in units of $\\mathrm{dmol \\ cm^{-3}}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the mean residue concentration, $C$.\nThe molar concentration of the peptide is $c_{\\mathrm{pep}} = 25\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M} = 25 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}$.\nThe number of residues is $N_{\\mathrm{res}} = 50$.\nThe molar concentration of residues is $c_{\\mathrm{res}} = N_{\\mathrm{res}} \\times c_{\\mathrm{pep}} = 50 \\times 25 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}} = 1.25 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}$.\n\nWe convert $c_{\\mathrm{res}}$ to the required units of $\\mathrm{dmol\\ cm^{-3}}$:\n$1\\ \\mathrm{mol} = 10\\ \\mathrm{dmol}$\n$1\\ \\mathrm{L} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{cm^3}$\n$$ C = 1.25 \\times 10^{-3} \\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\times \\frac{10\\ \\mathrm{dmol}}{1\\ \\mathrm{mol}} \\times \\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{L}}{1000\\ \\mathrm{cm^3}} = 1.25 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{dmol\\ cm^{-3}} $$\nThe path length is given as $l = 0.10\\ \\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nThe mean residue ellipticity of a sample containing a mixture of secondary structures is the population-weighted average of the ellipticities of the pure components.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe analysis is based on the Transition State Theory (TST) applied to a two-state folding reaction, $U \\rightleftharpoons TS \\rightleftharpoons N$, where $U$ is the unfolded state, $N$ is the native state, and $TS$ is the transition state. The folding rate constant, $k_f$, is related to the free energy of activation for folding, $\\Delta G_{f}^{\\ddagger} = G_{TS} - G_{U}$, by the Eyring equation:\n$$k_{f} = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{f}^{\\ddagger}}{RT}\\right)$$\nwhere $A$ is a pre-exponential factor assumed to be constant for the wild type (WT) and all mutants (MUT).\n\nFrom this relationship, we can determine the change in the folding activation barrier upon mutation, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{f}^{\\ddagger} = \\Delta G_{f}^{\\ddagger, \\mathrm{MUT}} - \\Delta G_{f}^{\\ddagger, \\mathrm{WT}}$. Taking the ratio of the mutant and wild-type rate constants:\n$$\\frac{k_{f}^{\\mathrm{MUT}}}{k_{f}^{\\mathrm{WT}}} = \\frac{A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{f}^{\\ddagger, \\mathrm{MUT}}}{RT}\\right)}{A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{f}^{\\ddagger, \\mathrm{WT}}}{RT}\\right)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{f}^{\\ddagger, \\mathrm{MUT}} - \\Delta G_{f}^{\\ddagger, \\mathrm{WT}}}{RT}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta\\Delta G_{f}^{\\ddagger}}{RT}\\right)$$\nSolving for $\\Delta\\Delta G_{f}^{\\ddagger}$ yields:\n$$\\Delta\\Delta G_{f}^{\\ddagger} = -RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{f}^{\\mathrm{MUT}}}{k_{f}^{\\mathrm{WT}}}\\right)$$\nThe change in the equilibrium folding free energy upon mutation, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{N-U}$, is given by the difference in the stabilities of the mutant and wild-type proteins:\n$$\\Delta\\Delta G_{N-U} = \\Delta G_{N-U}^{\\mathrm{MUT}} - \\Delta G_{N-U}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$$\nA positive $\\Delta\\Delta G_{N-U}$ indicates that the mutation destabilizes the native state. The $\\phi$-value is defined as the ratio of these two energy changes:\n$$\\phi = \\frac{\\Delta\\Delta G_{f}^{\\ddagger}}{\\Delta\\Delta G_{N-U}}$$\nWe will calculate these values for each mutant and apply the criteria for folding nucleus membership: $\\phi \\geq 0.7$ and $\\Delta\\Delta G_{N-U} \\geq 2.0 \\ \\mathrm{kJ \\ mol^{-1}}$.\nFirst, we compute the constant term $RT$:\n$$RT = (8.314 \\ \\mathrm{J \\ mol^{-1} K^{-1}}) \\times (298 \\ \\mathrm{K}) = 2477.572 \\ \\mathrm{J \\ mol^{-1}} = 2.477572 \\ \\mathrm{kJ \\ mol^{-1}}$$\nThe wild-type values are $\\Delta G_{N-U}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = -22.0 \\ \\mathrm{kJ \\ mol^{-1}}$ and $k_{f}^{\\mathrm{WT}} = 120 \\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n\n1.  **Mutant I45A**: $\\Delta G_{N-U} = -16.0 \\ \\mathrm{kJ \\ mol^{-1}}$, $k_{f} = 10.5 \\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n    $\\Delta\\Delta G_{N-U} = (-16.0) - (-22.0) = 6.0 \\ \\mathrm{kJ \\ mol^{-1}}$.
