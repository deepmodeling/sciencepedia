The roles of the branchpoint, the polypyrimidine tract, the AG dinucleotide, the U2AF complex (U2AF1 and U2AF2), and the competitive nature of splice site selection are accurately represented.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear initial state (weak authentic site), a defined perturbation (insertion of a strong cryptic site), and quantitative data (distances, occupancy folds) that allow for a reasoned prediction based on the provided guiding principles. The question asks for the \"most likely predominant splicing outcome,\" which is a standard way to frame questions about stochastic biological processes.\n- **Objective and Consistent:** The language is objective and precise. The numerical data are internally consistent: the branchpoint is 20 nt upstream of the cryptic site, which is 10 nt upstream of the authentic site. This correctly places the branchpoint $20 + 10 = 30$ nt upstream of the authentic site, matching the provided information.\n- **Realism:** The nucleotide distances (20 nt, 30 nt) are well within the typical functional range for branchpoint-to-$3'$-AG spacing in mammalian introns. The creation of a strong cryptic splice site by mutation is a known phenomenon in genetics and disease. The eCLIP data showing differential factor occupancy are a realistic form of experimental evidence.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and well-posed. It provides sufficient information to proceed with a solution based on fundamental principles of splicing.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe central task is to predict which of two competing $3'$ splice sites—the original authentic site and the newly introduced cryptic site—will be predominantly used by the splicing machinery. The guiding principles provided in the problem statement itself direct the analysis. Splice site selection is a competitive process where the site that is more efficiently recognized by the spliceosome will be chosen. The strength of a $3'$ splice site is determined by a combination of sequence elements and their geometry.\n\n1.  **Recognition by U2AF:** The initial recognition of a $3'$ splice site is mediated by the U2AF heterodimer. U2AF2 (also known as U2AF65) binds to the polypyrimidine tract (PPT), and U2AF1 (also known as U2AF35) binds to the terminal AG dinucleotide of the intron. The strength of these interactions is a primary determinant of splice site strength.\n    - **Polypyrimidine Tract (PPT):** The cryptic site's PPT is long and U-rich ($~14$ U's), which is optimal for high-affinity binding by U2AF2. The authentic site's PPT is short ($~6$ U's), indicating a weak interaction.\n    - **U2AF Occupancy:** The experimental eCLIP data provide direct evidence of this differential binding. U2AF2 occupancy is $\\sim 4$-fold higher at the cryptic site, and U2AF1 occupancy is $\\sim 3$-fold higher. This quantitatively confirms that the U2AF complex binds much more strongly to the cryptic site than to the weak authentic site.\n\n2.  **Geometric Constraints:** Productive splicing requires a proper distance between the branchpoint adenosine (A) and the $3'$ splice site AG dinucleotide. The spliceosome must assemble across this region.\n    - **Cryptic Site Geometry:** The distance from the branchpoint A to the cryptic site AG is 20 nucleotides. This distance is considered optimal for efficient splicing in human cells.\n    - **Authentic Site Geometry:** The distance from the branchpoint A to the authentic site AG is 30 nucleotides. While this is within the acceptable range (typically 18-40 nt), it is less optimal than the 20 nt distance of the cryptic site.\n\n3.  **Competition and Outcome:** The problem explicitly states to use the principle that \"selection favoring sites with higher U2AF occupancy and appropriate geometry.\" Based on the analysis above:\n    - The cryptic site has vastly superior U2AF occupancy (both subunits).\n    - The cryptic site has a more optimal geometric distance from the branchpoint.\n\nBoth key determinants of $3'$ splice site strength unequivocally favor the cryptic site. Therefore, in the competition for the splicing machinery, the cryptic site will be selected predominantly over the authentic site.\n\nThe cryptic site is located 10 nucleotides *upstream* of the authentic site (i.e., further into the intron). When the spliceosome uses this cryptic site, the splice is made at this upstream position. This means the 10-nucleotide segment of the intron that lies between the cryptic site and the authentic site will not be removed. Instead, it will be included in the mature mRNA, becoming part of the exon. This results in the exon being extended at its $5'$ end by 10 nucleotides.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. Predominant selection of the upstream cryptic $3'$ splice site, shifting the exon boundary upstream and yielding an exon extended at its $5'$ end (inclusion of the intronic segment between the cryptic and authentic sites).**\n    This option is the direct consequence of our derivation. The cryptic site is stronger in every molecular aspect presented (PPT quality, U2AF binding, geometry) and will therefore outcompete the weak authentic site. Its upstream location leads to the inclusion of the intervening 10 nucleotides, extending the exon at its $5'$ terminus.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. No change in exon boundary, because exon definition across the unchanged downstream exon forces use of the original authentic $3'$ splice site despite weaker U2AF occupancy.**\n    This option invokes the concept of exon definition, where splice sites flanking an exon are recognized as a pair. While this mechanism is important, particularly for small exons, it does not represent an absolute rule that cannot be overridden by a dramatically superior competing splice site. The $>3$-fold increase in binding of the core recognition factors (U2AF) to a site with better geometry represents a very strong signal. In splicing, the competition between local splice signals is a dominant force. To assume the original, weak site will be used in the face of a new, vastly superior competitor is biologically untenable. The most predominant outcome will be dictated by the strongest signals.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Increased exon skipping, because the presence of the cryptic $3'$ splice site impairs U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U2 snRNP) recruitment to the branchpoint.**\n    This statement is mechanistically flawed. U2AF binding to the PPT and AG is the event that *recruits* the U2 snRNP to the branchpoint. Given that U2AF binding is substantially *stronger* at the cryptic site region, the recruitment of U2 snRNP to the nearby branchpoint should be enhanced, not impaired. The introduction of a strong site should promote, not inhibit, spliceosome assembly. Therefore, increased exon skipping due to impaired U2 snRNP recruitment is the opposite of what is expected.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Increased intron retention across the upstream intron, because competition between two nearby $3'$ splice sites stalls spliceosome assembly and reduces splicing efficiency at both sites.**\n    While competition between sites of comparable strength can sometimes be non-productive, the scenario here is a competition between a \"strong\" site and a \"weak\" site. Such an imbalance typically results in a decisive 'win' for the stronger site, leading to efficient splicing at that new location. It does not typically lead to a global stalling of the spliceosome and retention of the entire intron. The presence of a strong consensus site is a signal for *efficient* splicing, not its inhibition.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2774578"}, {"introduction": "After predicting splicing outcomes, the final step is to measure them experimentally.

A Normal approximation uses the exact mean and variance of the distribution it is approximating.\nThe mean, $\\mu$, of a $\\mathrm{Beta}(\\alpha, \\beta)$ distribution is:\n$$\\mu = E[\\psi] = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha + \\beta}$$\nThe variance, $\\sigma^2$, of a $\\mathrm{Beta}(\\alpha, \\beta)$ distribution is:\n$$\\sigma^2 = \\mathrm{Var}[\\psi] = \\frac{\\alpha \\beta}{(\\alpha + \\beta)^2 (\\alpha + \\beta + 1)}$$\nFor the posterior distribution $\\mathrm{Beta}(91, 21)$:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{91}{91 + 21} = \\frac{91}{112}$$\n$$\\sigma^2 = \\frac{91 \\times 21}{(91 + 21)^2 (91 + 21 + 1)} = \\frac{1911}{(112)^2 (113)} = \\frac{1911}{12544 \\times 113} = \\frac{1911}{1417472}$$\nThe standard deviation $\\sigma$ is the square root of the variance:\n$$\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1911}{1417472}}$$\nAn approximate two-sided $95\\%$ credible interval is given by $\\mu \\pm z_{0.975} \\sigma$, where $z_{0.975}$ is the $97.5$th percentile of the standard normal distribution. The problem provides $z_{0.975} = 1.96$.\nThe lower bound of this interval is $\\mu - 1.96 \\sigma$.\nLet us compute the numerical values:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{91}{112} = 0.8125$$\n$$\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1911}{1417472}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.0013481405} \\approx 0.036717033$$\nThe lower bound, $L.B.$, is:\n$$L.B. = \\mu - 1.96 \\sigma \\approx 0.8125 - 1.96 \\times 0.036717033$$\n$$L.B. \\approx 0.8125 - 0.071965385 \\approx 0.740534615$$\nThe problem requires rounding the answer to four significant figures.\nThe calculated value $0.740534615$ rounded to four significant figures is $0.7405$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7405}$$", "id": "2774622"}]}
