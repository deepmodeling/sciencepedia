The concepts of Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB), targeted exome sequencing, nonsynonymous mutations, and neoantigen load are central principles in modern tumor immunology and immuno-oncology. The provided numerical values are within plausible ranges. A TMB of $150$ mutations per megabase, derived from $300$ mutations in a $2$ Mb panel, is characteristic of a hypermutated tumor phenotype, which is observed in specific cancer types, for instance, those with mismatch repair deficiency. The neoantigen conversion factor of $c = 0.02$, or $2\\%$, is also consistent with estimates in the scientific literature, which typically range from $1-5\\%$. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and data for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles, is not incomplete or contradictory, and is not trivial. It is a straightforward quantitative application of standard definitions in bioinformatics and cancer biology.\n\nThe verdict is that the problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe first quantity to compute is the Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB). The problem defines TMB as the number of somatic coding nonsynonymous mutations per megabase.\nThe total number of such mutations is given as $N_{mut} = 300$.\nThe size of the genomic region examined is $L = 2$ Mb.\nTherefore, the TMB is calculated as the ratio of these two quantities:\n$$\n\\text{TMB} = \\frac{N_{mut}}{L}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\text{TMB} = \\frac{300}{2} = 150 \\text{ mutations/Mb}\n$$\n\nThe second quantity to compute is the expected total neoantigen load.\nLet $M_i$ be the $i$-th nonsynonymous mutation, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 300\\}$.\nLet $X_i$ be the random variable representing the number of immunogenic neoantigenic peptides yielded by mutation $M_i$.\nThe problem states that on average, each mutation yields $c$ neoantigens. This is the expected value of $X_i$:\n$$\nE[X_i] = c = 0.02\n$$\nThe total neoantigen load, which we denote as $N_{neo}$, is the sum of the neoantigens produced by all individual mutations:\n$$\nN_{neo} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{mut}} X_i\n$$\nThe problem asks for the expected total neoantigen load, $E[N_{neo}]$. By the linearity of expectation, the expected value of a sum of random variables is the sum of their expected values. This property holds regardless of whether the variables are independent.\n$$\nE[N_{neo}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{mut}} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{mut}} E[X_i]\n$$\nSince the expected number of neoantigens is the same for each mutation, $E[X_i] = c$ for all $i$, we can simplify the sum:\n$$\nE[N_{neo}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{mut}} c = N_{mut} \\times c\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $N_{mut} = 300$ and $c = 0.02$:\n$$\nE[N_{neo}] = 300 \\times 0.02 = 6\n$$\nThe expected total neoantigen load is a unitless count of $6$.\n\nThe two required values are the TMB and the expected neoantigen load.\nTMB is $150$ mutations/Mb.\nExpected neoantigen load is $6$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 150 & 6 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2847250"}, {"introduction": "While a high Tumor Mutational Burden suggests a large pool of potential neoantigens, not all are equally effective at stimulating an immune response.

The assumptions are consistent with one another and serve to isolate the effect of binding affinity ($K_d$) on immunogenicity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is deemed **valid**. It presents a standard, albeit simplified, model of competitive peptide binding to MHC molecules, which is a common exercise in quantitative immunology. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe core of the problem lies in applying the law of mass action to the equilibrium binding of peptides $E_1$ and $E_2$ to MHC molecules. Let $P_1$ and $P_2$ represent the free peptides, $M$ represent the free MHC molecules (HLA-A$^\\ast$02:01), and $C_1$ and $C_2$ represent the respective peptide-MHC complexes.\n\nThe binding reactions at equilibrium are:\n$$ P_1 + M \\rightleftharpoons C_1 $$\n$$ P_2 + M \\rightleftharpoons C_2 $$\n\nThe dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined for each reaction as:\n$$ K_{d1} = \\frac{[P_1][M]}{[C_1]} = 50\\,\\mathrm{nM} $$\n$$ K_{d2} = \\frac{[P_2][M]}{[C_2]} = 500\\,\\mathrm{nM} $$\n\nHere, $[X]$ denotes the equilibrium concentration of species $X$. We must determine the ratio of the formed complexes, which is equivalent to the ratio of their surface densities or \"occupancy.\" Rearranging the equations for the concentration of the complexes, we get:\n$$ [C_1] = \\frac{[P_1][M]}{K_{d1}} $$\n$$ [C_2] = \\frac{[P_2][M]}{K_{d2}} $$\n\nThe problem states that the concentrations of free peptides available for loading are equal, so $[P_1] = [P_2]$. Both peptides compete for the same pool of MHC molecules, so the concentration of free MHC molecules, $[M]$, is the same for both equilibria.\n\nWe can now compute the ratio of the concentrations of the two complexes:\n$$ \\frac{[C_1]}{[C_2]} = \\frac{\\frac{[P_1][M]}{K_{d1}}}{\\frac{[P_2][M]}{K_{d2}}} $$\n\nSince $[P_1] = [P_2]$ and $[M]$ is common to both terms, they cancel out, yielding:\n$$ \\frac{[C_1]}{[C_2]} = \\frac{K_{d2}}{K_{d1}} $$\n\nSubstituting the given values for the dissociation constants:\n$$ \\frac{[C_1]}{[C_2]} = \\frac{500\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{50\\,\\mathrm{nM}} = 10 $$\n\nThis result indicates that the steady-state concentration (and number) of $E_1$-MHC complexes is $10$ times greater than that of $E_2$-MHC complexes. According to the problem's explicit assumption that T cell activation is a monotonic function of the number of pMHC complexes, a higher number of $E_1$-MHC complexes will lead to a stronger T cell response. The assumption of similar TCR affinity distributions and precursor frequencies ensures that the differential response is driven by the number of presented complexes, not by differences in the responding T cell populations. Therefore, the epitope $E_1$ will dominate the CD8$^+$ T cell response.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n- **A. $E_1$ dominates; at equal peptide availability its HLA occupancy is approximately $10$-fold higher than $E_2$, so it elicits a stronger CD8$^+$ response.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with the derivation. The calculated ratio of occupancy $[C_1]/[C_2]$ is exactly $10$. A lower $K_d$ signifies higher binding affinity, leading to greater occupancy at equilibrium. Given the problem's assumptions, this directly translates to a stronger immune response.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. $E_2$ dominates; weaker binding (higher $K_d$) increases complex turnover and serial engagement, yielding a stronger CD8$^+$ response despite lower occupancy.**\nThis argument invokes the concept of serial TCR engagement, a kinetic phenomenon where a single pMHC complex with a fast off-rate (related to high $K_d$) might engage and activate multiple T cells. However, this contradicts a direct and explicit assumption of the problem: \"Activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes depends monotonically on the number of peptide–MHC complexes at the cell surface.\" This assumption mandates that the response strength is determined by the steady-state number of complexes, not their turnover rate or other kinetic properties. The problem must be solved within its own stated constraints.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. Neither epitope dominates; equal transcript expression guarantees equal CD8$^+$ responses regardless of $K_d$.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. It incorrectly assumes that equal peptide production ($[P_1] = [P_2]$) leads to equal surface presentation ($[C_1] = [C_2]$). Our derivation based on the law of mass action demonstrates that this is not the case; the binding affinity, quantified by $K_d$, is a critical determinant of the number of stable pMHC complexes formed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. Dominance cannot be inferred from $K_d$ under these conditions; without knowing TCR affinities, no quantitative prediction is possible.**\nThis statement is invalidated by an explicit assumption in the problem statement: \"Similar distributions of T Cell Receptor (TCR) affinity and precursor frequency across T cells specific for $E_1$ and $E_2$.\" This crucial condition is provided precisely so that the variable of TCR affinity can be factored out, allowing for a prediction based solely on the upstream events of peptide presentation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2847261"}, {"introduction": "The constant battle between the immune system and cancer drives a process of immunoediting, where tumors evolve mechanisms to evade immune surveillance.

For WT versus KO, the measured MFI values are: HLA-A/B/C $=120$ versus $=4$, HLA-E $=70$ versus $=3$, and NKG2D ligands $=15$ versus $=60$. In vitro cytotoxicity assays show that Cluster of Differentiation 8 (CD8$^+$) T cell-mediated lysis of WT is $65\\%$ at an effector-to-target ratio of $10{:}1$, while lysis of KO is $5\\%$ under identical conditions.

Loss of B2M destabilizes MHC I, abrogating target-cell peptide presentation and markedly reducing CD8$^+$ T cell cytotoxicity; reduced HLA-A/B/C and HLA-E remove inhibitory input, while elevated NKG2D ligands tip the balance toward NK activation via missing-self, so NK cells compensate; IFN-$\\gamma$ cannot restore surface MHC I without B2M, and KIR blockade adds little inhibition relief.\n\nB.

CD8$^+$ T cell recognition is unchanged because the T cell receptor recognizes peptide independently of MHC I, and NK cell activity is unaffected because it does not sense changes in MHC I.\n\nD.

The role of $\\text{B2M}$ in $\\text{MHC I}$ assembly and surface expression is a cornerstone of cellular immunology. The consequence of $\\text{MHC I}$ loss—escape from CD8$^+$ T cell surveillance and induction of \"missing-self\" recognition by $\\text{NK}$ cells—is a classic and well-documented mechanism of tumor immune evasion. The interplay between inhibitory ($\\text{KIR}$, $\\text{CD}94/\\text{NKG2A}$) and activating ($\\text{NKG2D}$) receptors on $\\text{NK}$ cells is also described correctly.

It is free from subjective claims or ambiguity.\n- **Conclusion of Validation:** The problem does not violate any criteria for invalidity. It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe analysis will proceed by integrating the provided definitions with the experimental data.\n\n1.  **Impact of $\\text{B2M}$ Loss on $\\text{MHC I}$ and CD8$^+$ T Cell Recognition:**\n    - Per definition (i), $\\text{B2M}$ is required for stable surface expression of the $\\text{MHC I}$ complex.\n    - The KO clone is $\\text{B2M}$-null. The data confirms the expected outcome: surface expression of classical $\\text{MHC I}$ ($\\text{HLA-A/B/C}$) is nearly abolished, with MFI dropping from $120$ in WT to $4$ in KO. Surface expression of the nonclassical $\\text{MHC I}$ molecule $\\text{HLA}$-E, which also relies on $\\text{B2M}$ for its stability and expression, is similarly abrogated (MFI from $70$ to $3$).\n    - Per definition (ii), CD8$^+$ T cells recognizes peptides presented by $\\text{MHC I}$.\n    - The loss of surface $\\text{MHC I}$ on KO cells prevents the presentation of tumor-associated antigens to CD8$^+$ T cells. The data confirms this functional consequence: CD8$^+$ T cell-mediated lysis plummets from $65\\%$ against WT cells to a background level of $5\\%$ against KO cells. This demonstrates a potent mechanism of immune escape from T cell surveillance.\n\n2.  **Impact of $\\text{B2M}$ Loss on $\\text{NK}$ Cell Recognition (Compensatory Mechanism):**\n    - Per definition (iii), $\\text{NK}$ cell activation is a balance between inhibitory and activating signals.\n    - **Inhibitory Signals:** $\\text{NK}$ cells are inhibited by recognizing self-$\\text{MHC I}$ molecules. Receptors like $\\text{KIR}$ recognize classical $\\text{MHC I}$ ($\\text{HLA-A/B/C}$), and $\\text{CD}94/\\text{NKG2A}$ recognizes $\\text{HLA}$-E. In the KO clone, both $\\text{HLA-A/B/C}$ and $\\text{HLA-E}$ are absent from the surface. This leads to a profound loss of inhibitory signals, a phenomenon known as \"missing-self\" recognition.\n    - **Activating Signals:** The KO clone shows a significant upregulation of $\\text{NKG2D}$ ligands (MFI increases from $15$ to $60$). This provides a strong activating signal to $\\text{NK}$ cells via their $\\text{NKG2D}$ receptor.\n    - **Net Effect:** The combination of lost inhibition (\"missing-self\") and gained activation (upregulated stress ligands) tips the balance strongly toward $\\text{NK}$ cell activation. The data validates this: $\\text{NK}$ cell lysis is low against WT cells ($10\\%$, which express $\\text{MHC I}$ and inhibit $\\text{NK}$ cells) but very high against KO cells ($55\\%$). This represents a compensatory immune mechanism, where the $\\text{NK}$ cell system targets cells that have evaded the CD8$^+$ T cell system by downregulating $\\text{MHC I}$.\n    - The role of the activating pathway is confirmed by the $\\text{NKG2D}$ blockade experiment. Blocking this single activating receptor reduces lysis of KO cells from $55\\%$ to $15\\%$. This demonstrates that the $\\text{NKG2D}$ pathway is a major, though not sole, contributor to the high level of $\\text{NK}$ cell killing. The remaining $15\\%$ lysis is likely driven by the \"missing-self\" mechanism and potentially other activating receptors.\n\n3.  **Effect of $\\text{IFN-}\\gamma$ Treatment:**\n    - The experiment shows that $\\text{IFN-}\\gamma$ increases the amount of $\\text{MHC I}$ heavy-chain $\\text{mRNA}$ by $3$-fold in KO cells. This is a known effect of $\\text{IFN-}\\gamma$.\n    - However, this transcriptional upregulation fails to restore surface $\\text{MHC I}$ protein expression (MFI remains at $5$). This is because the genetic defect is the absence of the $\\text{B2M}$ protein. Without this essential partner protein for folding and transport, the newly synthesized heavy chains cannot form a stable heterodimer and reach the cell surface, as stated in definition (i). This result confirms that the defect is structural and cannot be bypassed simply by increasing transcription of other components.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Loss of B2M destabilizes MHC I, abrogating target-cell peptide presentation and markedly reducing CD8$^+$ T cell cytotoxicity; reduced HLA-A/B/C and HLA-E remove inhibitory input, while elevated NKG2D ligands tip the balance toward NK activation via missing-self, so NK cells compensate; IFN-$\\gamma$ cannot restore surface MHC I without B2M, and KIR blockade adds little inhibition relief.**\n- This option accurately summarizes all points derived from the data.\n- It correctly links $\\text{B2M}$ loss to $\\text{MHC I}$ destabilization and reduced CD8$^+$ T cell cytotoxicity ($65\\% \\rightarrow 5\\%$).\n- It correctly identifies the dual effect on $\\text{NK}$ cells: loss of inhibitory signals from both $\\text{HLA-A/B/C}$ and $\\text{HLA-E}$ (\"missing-self\") and gain of activating signals from $\\text{NKG2D}$ ligands, leading to compensatory activation ($10\\% \\rightarrow 55\\%$).\n- It correctly notes that $\\text{IFN-}\\gamma$ is ineffective at restoring surface $\\text{MHC I}$ in the absence of $\\text{B2M}$.\n- The final clause, \"$\\text{KIR}$ blockade adds little inhibition relief,\" is a sound logical deduction. Since $\\text{KIR}$ ligands ($\\text{HLA-A/B/C}$) are already absent on KO cells (MFI=$4$), there is minimal $\\text{KIR}$-mediated inhibition to relieve. Blocking $\\text{KIRs}$ would therefore have little to no effect.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. B2M loss enhances CD8$^+$ T cell killing through dendritic-cell cross-presentation of tumor antigens, while NK cells are inhibited because HLA-E remains on the surface and strengthens CD94/NKG2A inhibitory signaling.**\n- The first clause is incorrect. The data shows a massive *reduction*, not enhancement, of direct CD8$^+$ T cell killing ($65\\% \\rightarrow 5\\%$). Cross-presentation is an *in vivo* priming mechanism and is irrelevant to the direct target cell lysis assay shown.\n- The second clause is also incorrect.

CD8$^+$ T cell recognition is unchanged because the T cell receptor recognizes peptide independently of MHC I, and NK cell activity is unaffected because it does not sense changes in MHC I.**\n- This statement contradicts fundamental immunological principles given in definitions (ii) and (iii).\n- CD8$^+$ T cell recognition is not unchanged; it drops from $65\\%$ to $5\\%$, precisely because the T cell receptor requires $\\text{MHC I}$.\n- $\\text{NK}$ cell activity is not unaffected; it increases from $10\\%$ to $55\\%$, precisely because it senses the absence of $\\text{MHC I}$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.
