Transient overexpression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2).\n    2.  Pharmacological inhibition of caspase-8.\n- **Experimental Design**: $2 \\times 2$ matrix (vector versus Bcl-2 overexpression) by ($\\pm$ caspase-8 inhibitor).\n- **Available Readouts**:\n    1.  Initiator caspase-8 activity.\n    2.  Executioner caspase-3 cleavage/activity.\n    3.  Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), assessed by cytochrome c release.\n    4.

Extrinsic apoptosis is initiated by death receptor activation, formation of the Death-Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC), and activation of caspase-8. Executioner caspases like caspase-3 mediate apoptosis.\n    2.  In type I cells, robust DISC formation yields sufficient active caspase-8 to directly activate executioner caspases without mitochondrial amplification.\n    3.  In type II cells, DISC-derived caspase-8 activity is insufficient. Caspase-8 must cleave BH3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid) to truncated Bid (tBid), which induces MOMP. MOMP releases cytochrome c, leading to caspase-9 activation and amplification of the caspase cascade.\n    4.  Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 localizes to mitochondria and blocks MOMP. Bcl-2 does not inhibit DISC formation or caspase-8 activation.\n    5.  A selective caspase-8 inhibitor blocks events downstream of DISC that require caspase-8 catalytic activity, including Bid cleavage.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated based on the established criteria.\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on the well-established and canonical pathways of extrinsic apoptosis. The roles of caspase-8, caspase-3, Bcl-2, MOMP, and cytochrome c are described in accordance with standard molecular and cell biology literature. The distinction between type I and type II pathways is a fundamental concept in apoptosis research. The problem is free of scientific error or pseudoscience.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem sets a clear objective (discriminate type I vs. type II), provides a specific set of tools (perturbations and readouts), and defines the system (a cell line stimulated with a ligand). This structure allows for a unique, logical solution to be derived from the provided facts.\n-   **Objective**: The language is technical, precise, and devoid of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem provides all necessary information. The foundational facts are self-consistent and sufficient to construct a logical experimental strategy. There are no contradictions.\n-   **Realism**: The experimental design ($2 \\times 2$ matrix with overexpression and inhibitors), the perturbations, and the readouts (caspase assays, Annexin V, cytochrome c release) are all standard, feasible techniques in a cell biology laboratory.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It represents a valid and standard conceptual problem in experimental biology. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe core task is to distinguish between two pathways originating from the same initial signal (death receptor activation) but diverging in their downstream amplification mechanisms. The logical approach is to perturb the system at a point where the two pathways differ.\n\n1.  **Shared Upstream Events**: Both type I and type II pathways are initiated by the activation of caspase-8 at the DISC. Consequently, inhibiting caspase-8 must block apoptosis in both cell types. This provides a critical control: if the caspase-8 inhibitor does not abrogate apoptosis, the observed cell death is not classical extrinsic apoptosis, and the premises of the experiment are violated.\n\n2.  **Divergent Amplification**: The key difference lies in the dependency on the mitochondrial pathway.\n    -   **Type I cells**: Caspase-8 activity is high enough to directly activate executioner caspase-3, bypassing the need for mitochondrial involvement.\n    -   **Type II cells**: Caspase-8 activity is low and requires an amplification loop through the mitochondria. Caspase-8 cleaves Bid to tBid, which triggers MOMP. This is the crucial amplification step.\n\n3.  **Targeting the Divergence Point**: The protein Bcl-2 is an inhibitor of MOMP. According to the provided facts, Bcl-2 acts at the mitochondria and does not affect upstream caspase-8 activation. This makes Bcl-2 the ideal tool to probe the dependency on the mitochondrial loop.\n    -   In **Type I cells**, where apoptosis proceeds without requiring MOMP, overexpression of Bcl-2 should have little to no effect on the final apoptotic outcome (e.g., caspase-3 activation, Annexin V positivity).\n    -   In **Type II cells**, where apoptosis is critically dependent on MOMP for signal amplification, overexpression of Bcl-2 will block this step, leading to a significant reduction or complete inhibition of apoptosis.\n\n4.  **Optimal Experimental Strategy**: A $2 \\times 2$ experimental design is appropriate. The conditions are:\n    i.  Vector control cells + Ligand: Establishes the baseline apoptotic response.\n    ii. Vector control cells + Ligand + caspase-8 inhibitor: Confirms that apoptosis is caspase-8-dependent. Apoptosis should be blocked.\n    iii. Bcl-2 overexpressing cells + Ligand: This is the discriminatory condition. Comparison of apoptosis levels with condition (i) reveals the cell type.\n    iv. Bcl-2 overexpressing cells + Ligand + caspase-8 inhibitor: Serves as an additional control. Apoptosis should be blocked, as in condition (ii).\n\n    **Decision Rule**: After stimulating all four conditions with the ligand, measure apoptotic readouts.\n    -   If apoptosis in condition (iii) is not significantly reduced compared to condition (i), the cells are **type I**.\n    -   If apoptosis in condition (iii) is significantly reduced compared to condition (i), the cells are **type II**.\n    In both cases, apoptosis must be nearly abolished in conditions (ii) and (iv). The readouts (caspase-3 activity, Annexin V, cytochrome c release) are all valid measures of the apoptotic process and its intermediate steps. Measuring multiple readouts provides a more robust conclusion.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Perform a $2 \\times 2$ matrix: vector control $\\pm$ caspase-8 inhibitor and Bcl-2 overexpression $\\pm$ caspase-8 inhibitor. After TRAIL stimulation for $6$ hours, quantify caspase-3 activity, Annexin V positivity, and cytochrome c release. Decision rule: If Bcl-2 overexpression significantly suppresses MOMP and reduces caspase-3 activation and apoptosis (for example, by $\\geq 50\\%$, with $p<0.05$) while caspase-8 inhibition abolishes apoptosis in both vector and Bcl-2 cells, classify as type II. If Bcl-2 overexpression reduces MOMP but does not significantly reduce caspase-3 activation or apoptosis, yet caspase-8 inhibition abolishes apoptosis, classify as type I.**\n\nThis option describes the exact experimental design and decision logic derived from first principles. It correctly identifies that the key differentiator is the sensitivity to Bcl-2 overexpression. It correctly states that Bcl-2 overexpression will significantly inhibit apoptosis in type II cells. It correctly notes that in type I cells, Bcl-2 will not significantly block the final apoptotic outcome. It also correctly includes the critical control that caspase-8 anhibition must block apoptosis in all contexts. The use of multiple robust readouts enhances the quality of the experiment. The parenthetical note in the type I rule (\"reduces MOMP but does not significantly reduce caspase-3 activation\") correctly allows for the possibility that some minor level of MOMP might occur in type I cells but is not required for the main apoptotic execution, which is consistent with some literature. This option is logical and scientifically sound.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Treat vector-only cells with a caspase-8 inhibitor at a submaximal ligand dose and classify as type I if the inhibitor produces near-complete blockade of apoptosis (for example, $\\geq 80\\%$ reduction) and as type II if the inhibitor produces only partial blockade (for example, $\\leq 40\\%$ reduction), because type II apoptosis is less dependent on caspase-8.**\n\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. The premise \"type II apoptosis is less dependent on caspase-8\" is incorrect. Both type I and type II extrinsic apoptosis pathways are absolutely dependent on the catalytic activity of caspase-8 as the initiator caspase. In both cases, caspase-8 lies at the apex of the cascade, directly downstream of the DISC. Inhibition of caspase-8 will therefore block the initiation of apoptosis in both cell types. The difference between type I and type II cells is the *amount* of active caspase-8 required to trigger downstream events, not the *dependency* on caspase-8 itself. This strategy would fail to distinguish the two types.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Overexpress Bcl-2 and measure caspase-8 enzymatic activity at $2$ hours post-stimulation. If Bcl-2 reduces caspase-8 activity by $\\geq 50\\%$, classify as type II, because Bcl-2 is upstream of caspase-8 in type II cells but not in type I cells.**\n\nThis option contains a critical error of fact. The foundational facts explicitly state that \"Bcl-2 localizes to mitochondria and blocks MOMP; Bcl-2 does not inhibit DISC formation or caspase-8 activation.\" Therefore, Bcl-2 is downstream of caspase-8 activation in both type I and type II pathways. It acts at the mitochondrial level to block the amplification loop required in type II cells. It cannot possibly affect the activity of caspase-8 which is generated upstream at the DISC. The premise of this option is in direct contradiction with the provided biological facts.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Perform the $2 \\times 2$ matrix with vector/Bcl-2 and $\\pm$ caspase-8 inhibitor, but use only caspase-3 activity as the readout. Decision rule: Classify as type I only if caspase-8 inhibition fails to block caspase-3 activation in Bcl-2 overexpressing cells, because type I cells have caspase-8-independent executioner activation, and as type II if caspase-8 inhibition blocks caspase-3 in both vector and Bcl-2 cells.**\n\nThis option's decision rule is based on a completely false premise. The statement \"type I cells have caspase-8-independent executioner activation\" is incorrect in the context of extrinsic apoptosis. The very definition of extrinsic apoptosis (both types) involves initiation by death receptors and caspase-8. Therefore, inhibition of caspase-8 *must* block subsequent caspase-3 activation in type I cells, just as it does in type II cells. The proposed decision rule—looking for a case where caspase-8 inhibition *fails* to block apoptosis—is designed to detect a phenomenon that does not occur in either pathway as defined.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2932745"}, {"introduction": "Cellular processes are not isolated events; they are part of a dynamic, interconnected system.

Use the following ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for ATP concentration, MOMP progression, and active caspase-$3$ fraction:\n- Variables: $A(t)$ in $\\mathrm{mM}$, $m(t)$ unitless in $[0,1]$, $c(t)$ unitless in $[0,1]$.\n- Parameters and inputs:\n  - Glycolytic ATP production capacity: $k_{\\mathrm{gly}}$ in $\\mathrm{mM}/\\mathrm{min}$.\n  - Glycolysis inhibition factor: $g \\in [0,1]$ (with $g=1$ meaning no inhibition).\n  - Oxidative phosphorylation ATP production (when mitochondria are intact): $k_{\\mathrm{ox}}$ in $\\mathrm{mM}/\\mathrm{min}$.\n  - ATP consumption parameters: $k_{\\mathrm{cons}}$ in $\\mathrm{mM}/\\mathrm{min}$ and $K_A$ in $\\mathrm{mM}$.\n  - First-order ATP loss: $k_{\\mathrm{leak}}$ in $\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n  - MOMP induction parameters: $k_{m0}$ in $\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$ and $K_B$ in $\\mu \\mathrm{M}$, with BH$3$ mimetic dose $B$ in $\\mu \\mathrm{M}$.\n  - Caspase activation parameters: $k_c$ in $\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, Hill coefficient $n$ (unitless), ATP half-saturation for apoptosome formation $K_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$ in $\\mathrm{mM}$, and caspase inactivation $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$ in $\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n\nThe model equations are:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} \\;=\\; g\\,k_{\\mathrm{gly}} \\;+\\; \\left(1 - m\\right) k_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\;-\\; \\underbrace{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cons}}\\,A}{K_A + A}\\right)}_{\\text{saturating consumption}} \\;-\\; k_{\\mathrm{leak}}\\,A,\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dm}{dt} \\;=\\; k_m\\,\\left(1 - m\\right), \\quad \\text{with} \\quad k_m \\;=\\; k_{m0}\\,\\frac{B}{K_B + B},\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dt} \\;=\\; k_c\\,m \\,\\underbrace{\\left(\\frac{A^n}{K_{\\mathrm{ATP}}^n + A^n}\\right)}_{\\text{ATP-dependent Hill function}} \\left(1 - c\\right) \\;-\\; k_{\\mathrm{deg}}\\,c.\n$$\n\nInitial conditions:\n$$\nA(0) \\;=\\; A_0, \\quad m(0) \\;=\\; 0, \\quad c(0) \\;=\\; 0.\n$$\n\nParameter values to use:\n- $A_0 \\;=\\; 2.0 \\;\\mathrm{mM}$,\n- $k_{\\mathrm{gly}} \\;=\\; 0.5 \\;\\mathrm{mM}/\\mathrm{min}$,\n- $k_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\;=\\; 0.5 \\;\\mathrm{mM}/\\mathrm{min}$,\n- $k_{\\mathrm{cons}} \\;=\\; 1.2 \\;\\mathrm{mM}/\\mathrm{min}$,\n- $K_A \\;=\\; 0.5 \\;\\mathrm{mM}$,\n- $k_{\\mathrm{leak}} \\;=\\; 0.02 \\;\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$,\n- $k_{m0} \\;=\\; 0.2 \\;\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$,\n- $K_B \\;=\\; 0.5 \\;\\mu \\mathrm{M}$,\n- $k_c \\;=\\; 0.2 \\;\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$,\n- $n \\;=\\; 3$,\n- $K_{\\mathrm{ATP}} \\;=\\; 0.5 \\;\\mathrm{mM}$,\n- $k_{\\mathrm{deg}} \\;=\\; 0.02 \\;\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n\nScientific assumptions underpinning this model:\n- Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) is approximated as an effectively irreversible process on the considered timescale, hence the factor $\\left(1-m\\right)$ multiplies mitochondrial ATP production.\n- Apoptosome formation and initiator caspase activation require adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP), approximated here by an ATP-dependent Hill function with coefficient $n$ and half-saturation $K_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$.\n- Active caspase-$3$ is promoted by MOMP (via cytochrome $c$ release) and ATP, and is opposed by inhibitor of apoptosis proteins summarized in a first-order inactivation term.\n\nComputational task. For each test case, simulate the ODEs over a time horizon $T_{\\max} \\;=\\; 180 \\;\\mathrm{min}$, and determine the first-passage time $t_{50}$ at which $c(t)$ first reaches the threshold $c(t) \\geq c_{\\mathrm{thr}}$ with $c_{\\mathrm{thr}} \\;=\\; 0.5$. If $c(t)$ does not reach the threshold by $T_{\\max}$, report a sentinel value of $-1.0$. Express all reported times in $\\mathrm{min}$, rounded to $2$ decimal places.\n\nNumerical requirements:\n- Ensure state constraints $A(t) \\geq 0$, $m(t) \\in [0,1]$, $c(t) \\in [0,1]$ are respected in evaluating reaction terms.\n- Use a numerically stable ODE solver suitable for potentially stiff dynamics.\n- Detect the threshold crossing using a robust root-finding event on $c(t) - c_{\\mathrm{thr}}$ in the upward direction.\n\nTest suite. Each test case is a pair $\\left(B, g\\right)$ with $B$ in $\\mu \\mathrm{M}$ and $g$ unitless:\n- Case $1$: $\\left(1.0, 1.0\\right)$,\n- Case $2$: $\\left(1.0, 0.0\\right)$,\n- Case $3$: $\\left(1.0, 0.5\\right)$,\n- Case $4$: $\\left(0.05, 1.0\\right)$,\n- Case $5$: $\\left(0.0, 1.0\\right)$,\n- Case $6$: $\\left(5.0, 0.2\\right)$.\n\nOutput specification. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, ordered by the test cases above. Each entry must be a decimal number in $\\mathrm{min}$ rounded to $2$ decimal places, with the value $-1.00$ if the threshold is not reached by $T_{\\max}$. No additional text should be printed.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated and found to be valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded, and computationally tractable problem in the field of systems biology. It constitutes a standard initial value problem for a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), for which a unique numerical solution exists. We will proceed with the formulation and execution of a computational solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to analyze a minimal dynamical system that models the interplay between cellular energy metabolism, represented by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration, and the activation of effector caspases, a key step in programmed cell death (apoptosis). The system is described by three coupled nonlinear ODEs:\n\n$1$. ATP concentration $A(t)$ (in $\\mathrm{mM}$):\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} \\;=\\; g\\,k_{\\mathrm{gly}} \\;+\\; \\left(1 - m\\right) k_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\;-\\; \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cons}}\\,A}{K_A + A} \\;-\\; k_{\\mathrm{leak}}\\,A\n$$\nThis equation balances ATP production and consumption. Production arises from glycolysis, scaled by a factor $g$, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, which is active only when mitochondria are intact (i.e., when the MOMP fraction $m$ is less than $1$). Consumption is modeled by a Michaelis-Menten-like term for cellular processes and a first-order leakage term.\n\n$2$. Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeabilization (MOMP) progression $m(t)$ (unitless, from $0$ to $1$):\n$$\n\\frac{dm}{dt} \\;=\\; k_m\\,\\left(1 - m\\right), \\quad \\text{where} \\quad k_m \\;=\\; k_{m0}\\,\\frac{B}{K_B + B}\n$$\nMOMP is modeled as an irreversible first-order process triggered by a BH$3$ mimetic drug at dose $B$. The rate constant $k_m$ depends on the drug dose $B$ via a saturating Michaelis-Menten-like function. As $m(t)$ increases from $0$ to $1$, the mitochondrial contribution to ATP production ceases.\n\n$3$. Active Caspase-$3$ fraction $c(t)$ (unitless, from $0$ to $1$):\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dt} \\;=\\; k_c\\,m \\,\\left(\\frac{A^n}{K_{\\mathrm{ATP}}^n + A^n}\\right) \\left(1 - c\\right) \\;-\\; k_{\\mathrm{deg}}\\,c\n$$\nCaspase-$3$ activation requires two inputs: the signal from MOMP ($m>0$, which implies cytochrome $c$ release) and sufficient ATP levels ($A$). The ATP dependence is captured by a steep cooperative Hill function. The term $(1-c)$ ensures that activation saturates when all procaspase-$3$ is converted. Active caspase is also subject to first-order inactivation, represented by the term $-k_{\\mathrm{deg}}c$.\n\nThe system is to be solved with the initial conditions $A(0) = A_0 = 2.0 \\;\\mathrm{mM}$, $m(0) = 0$, and $c(0) = 0$. The computational task is to determine, for several sets of parameters $(B, g)$, the first-passage time $t_{50}$ at which the active caspase-$3$ fraction $c(t)$ reaches the threshold $c_{\\mathrm{thr}} = 0.5$.\n\nTo solve this problem, we will perform a numerical integration of the ODE system. Given the coupled nature of the equations and the potential for a wide range of timescales (stiffness), a robust adaptive ODE solver is required. The `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` function from the SciPy library in Python is an appropriate choice. We will use the `LSODA` method, which is well-suited for such problems as it automatically detects stiffness and switches between non-stiff (Adams) and stiff (Backward Differentiation Formula, BDF) methods.\n\nTo precisely and efficiently find the time $t_{50}$, we will utilize the event detection feature of the solver. An event function, $f_{\\mathrm{event}}(t, \\mathbf{y}) = c(t) - c_{\\mathrm{thr}}$, is defined, where $\\mathbf{y}(t) = [A(t), m(t), c(t)]^T$ is the state vector. The solver is instructed to find a root of this function (i.e., where $c(t) = c_{\\mathrm{thr}}$) and to trigger the event only when $c(t)$ is increasing. This avoids a costly search through the output time series and provides high accuracy.\n\nThe overall algorithm is as follows:\nFor each test case pair $(B, g)$:\n$1$. The rate constant $k_m$ is computed based on the given value of $B$.\n$2$. The ODE system is integrated over the time interval $[0, T_{\\max}]$ where $T_{\\max} = 180 \\;\\mathrm{min}$, starting from the initial state $\\mathbf{y}(0) = [2.0, 0.0, 0.0]^T$.\n$3$. The `solve_ivp` function, equipped with the event detection logic, is called.\n$4$. If the event (threshold crossing) is detected, the time of the first occurrence is extracted from the solution object. This time is our $t_{50}$.\n$5$. If no event is detected within the time horizon, it is concluded that the threshold is not reached, and the specified sentinel value of $-1.0$ is assigned.\n$6$. The resulting time is rounded to two decimal places as required.\n\nThis procedure will be repeated for all specified test cases, and the results will be collected and formatted into the final specified output string. The physical constraints on the state variables ($A(t) \\ge 0$, $m(t) \\in [0,1]$, $c(t) \\in [0,1]$) are naturally handled by the structure of the ODEs, as the vector field directs the solution to remain within these bounds.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the coupled ODE system for apoptosis regulation for a suite of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the constant parameters of the model.\n    params = {\n        'A0': 2.0,          # mM, initial ATP\n        'k_gly': 0.5,       # mM/min, glycolytic ATP production capacity\n        'k_ox': 0.5,        # mM/min, oxidative phosphorylation ATP production\n        'k_cons': 1.2,      # mM/min, max ATP consumption rate\n        'K_A': 0.5,         # mM, ATP saturation constant for consumption\n        'k_leak': 0.02,     # min^-1, first-order ATP loss rate\n        'k_m0': 0.2,        # min^-1, max MOMP induction rate\n        'K_B': 0.5,         # muM, BH3 mimetic half-saturation dose\n        'k_c': 0.2,         # min^-1, caspase activation rate constant\n        'n': 3,             # unitless, Hill coefficient for ATP dependence\n        'K_ATP': 0.5,       # mM, ATP half-saturation for apoptosome\n        'k_deg': 0.02,      # min^-1, caspase inactivation rate\n    }\n\n    # Simulation and task parameters\n    T_max = 180.0\n    c_thr = 0.5\n\n    # Test suite: pairs of (B, g)\n    test_cases = [\n        (1.0, 1.0),  # Case 1\n        (1.0, 0.0),  # Case 2\n        (1.0, 0.5),  # Case 3\n        (0.05, 1.0), # Case 4\n        (0.0, 1.0),  # Case 5\n        (5.0, 0.2),  # Case 6\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n\n    def ode_system(t, y, p, B_val, g_val):\n        \"\"\"\n        Defines the system of ordinary differential equations.\n        y = [A, m, c]\n        \"\"\"\n        A, m, c = y\n\n        # Ensure state variable A is physically meaningful (non-negative).\n        # The ODE structure naturally prevents A from becoming negative if it starts at A>=0.\n        # But for robustness in numerical solvers, explicit check is good practice.\n        A = max(0.0, A)\n\n        # Calculate dose-dependent MOMP rate constant\n        k_m = p['k_m0'] * B_val / (p['K_B'] + B_val)\n\n        # Equation for ATP concentration, A(t)\n        dA_dt = g_val * p['k_gly'] + (1.0 - m) * p['k_ox'] - \\\n                (p['k_cons'] * A / (p['K_A'] + A)) - p['k_leak'] * A\n\n        # Equation for MOMP progression, m(t)\n        dm_dt = k_m * (1.0 - m)\n\n        # Equation for active caspase-3 fraction, c(t)\n        atp_hill_term = (A**p['n']) / (p['K_ATP']**p['n'] + A**p['n'])\n        dc_dt = p['k_c'] * m * atp_hill_term * (1.0 - c) - p['k_deg'] * c\n\n        return [dA_dt, dm_dt, dc_dt]\n\n    # Event function to detect when c(t) crosses the threshold c_thr\n    def event_c_threshold(t, y, p, B_val, g_val):\n        return y[2] - c_thr\n    event_c_threshold.terminal = True  # Stop integration once event is found\n    event_c_threshold.direction = 1   # Trigger only on upward crossing\n\n    for B, g in test_cases:\n        # Initial conditions for the state variables [A, m, c]\n        y0 = [params['A0'], 0.0, 0.0]\n\n        # Solve the ODE system\n        sol = solve_ivp(\n            fun=ode_system,\n            t_span=(0.0, T_max),\n            y0=y0,\n            args=(params, B, g),\n            method='LSODA',  # Suitable for potentially stiff systems\n            events=event_c_threshold,\n            dense_output=True # Recommended when using events\n        )\n\n        # Check if the event was triggered\n        if sol.t_events[0].size > 0:\n            # Event occurred, record the time\n            t_50 = sol.t_events[0][0]\n            results.append(f\"{t_50:.2f}\")\n        else:\n            # Event did not occur within T_max, record sentinel value\n            results.append(f\"{-1.0:.2f}\")\n\n    # Format and print the final output\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2777033"}]}
