The total concentrations are given as $[L]_{\\text{total}}$, $[P_1]_{\\text{total}}$, and $[P_2]_{\\text{total}}$. The cortisol-CBG complex is $[LP_1]$ and the cortisol-albumin complex is $[LP_2]$. The corresponding equilibrium dissociation constants are $K_{d,1}$ and $K_{d,2}$.\n\nThe problem is governed by the following set of equations based on mass conservation and the law of mass action:\n1. Conservation of total cortisol:\n$$[L]_{\\text{total}} = [L] + [LP_1] + [LP_2]$$\n2. Conservation of total CBG:\n$$[P_1]_{\\text{total}} = [P_1] + [LP_1]$$\n3.
