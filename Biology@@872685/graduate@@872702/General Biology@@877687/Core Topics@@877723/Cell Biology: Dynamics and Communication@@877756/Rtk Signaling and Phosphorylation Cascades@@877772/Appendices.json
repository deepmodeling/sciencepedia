Also, $x_{50}^2 = K_1 x_{50} + K_0$.\n$n_{H} = \\frac{K_{1}x_{50} + K_0 + K_0}{K_1 x_{50} + K_0} = \\frac{K_1 x_{50} + 2K_0}{K_1 x_{50} + K_0}$. This doesn't simplify nicely.\nLet's use the other expression for $n_{H}$: $n_{H} = 2 - \\frac{K_{1}}{x_{50}}$.\n$n_{H} = 2 - \\frac{K_{1}}{\\frac{K_{1} + \\sqrt{K_{1}^{2} + 4K_{0}}}{2}} = 2 - \\frac{2K_{1}}{K_{1} + \\sqrt{K_{1}^{2} + 4K_{0}}}$\nCombining terms into a single fraction:\n$n_{H} = \\frac{2(K_{1} + \\sqrt{K_{1}^{2} + 4K_{0}}) - 2K_{1}}{K_{1} + \\sqrt{K_{1}^{2} + 4K_{0}}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{K_{1}^{2} + 4K_{0}}}{K_{1} + \\sqrt{K_{1}^{2} + 4K_{0}}}$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the Hill coefficient at half-maximal activation.\n\nThe condition for ultrasensitivity (where $n_H$ approaches its upper bound of 2) is met when the term $K_1$ is vanishingly small compared to $\\sqrt{4K_0}$, which mathematically means the ratio $K_1^2 / K_0 \\ll 1$. This corresponds to a scenario where the intermediate state $S_1$ does not accumulate, which occurs if the second phosphorylation step is much more efficient than the first ($k_{\\text{cat}}^{2}/K_{M}^{2} \\gg k_{\\text{cat}}^{1}/K_{M}^{1}$) and/or the first dephosphorylation step is much more efficient than the second ($k_{p}^{1}/K_{P}^{1} \\gg k_{p}^{2}/K_{P}^{2}$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sqrt{K_{1}^{2} + 4K_{0}}}{K_{1} + \\sqrt{K_{1}^{2} + 4K_{0}}}}\n$$", "id": "2835853"}]}
