The relationship between capacitance, area, and specific capacitance ($C = C_{m}A$) is a fundamental principle of electrostatics.

The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, providing all necessary information and assumptions for a unique solution. It is free from scientific falsehoods, contradictions, or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe total electrical capacitance of the plasma membrane, $C_{total}$, is directly proportional to its total surface area, $A_{total}$. This relationship is defined by the specific membrane capacitance, $C_{m}$, which is an intrinsic property of the lipid bilayer and is given as constant. The governing equation is:\n$$C_{total} = C_{m} \\cdot A_{total}$$\nAny change in the total surface area of the plasma membrane, $\\Delta A_{total}$, will result in a corresponding change in the total capacitance, $\\Delta C_{total}$, given by $\\Delta C_{total} = C_{m} \\cdot \\Delta A_{total}$.\n\nFirst, we address the mechanistic justification.\nExocytosis is the process by which a vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane, releasing its contents to the exterior and incorporating its own membrane into the plasma membrane. As the problem states, we assume the vesicle completely flattens and its membrane area is conserved. This fusion event adds the surface area of the vesicle, $A_{vesicle}$, to the cell's plasma membrane. The change in the total membrane area is therefore positive: $\\Delta A_{total} = +A_{vesicle}$. Consequently, the change in capacitance is also positive:\n$$\\Delta C_{total} = C_{m} \\cdot (+A_{vesicle})$$\nSince a single vesicle fusion is a discrete, quantum event, it produces a discrete, stepwise increase—an upward step—in the measured capacitance trace.\n\nConversely, endocytosis is the process where a patch of plasma membrane invaginates and pinches off to form an intracellular vesicle. This process removes membrane area from the plasma membrane. The change in the total membrane area is negative, equal in magnitude to the surface area of the newly formed vesicle: $\\Delta A_{total} = -A_{vesicle}$. The corresponding change in capacitance is negative:\n$$\\Delta C_{total} = C_{m} \\cdot (-A_{vesicle})$$\nThis discrete removal of membrane results in a stepwise decrease—a downward step—in the capacitance trace.\n\nNext, we compute the expected amplitude of the capacitance step for the fusion of a single spherical vesicle. The amplitude of this step, $\\Delta C$, is given by:\n$$\\Delta C = C_{m} \\cdot A_{vesicle}$$\nThe givens are the vesicle diameter, $d = 50\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, and the specific membrane capacitance, $C_{m} = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{F/cm}^{2}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the surface area of the spherical vesicle, $A_{vesicle}$.\nThe radius of the vesicle is $r = \\frac{d}{2} = \\frac{50\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{2} = 25\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\nUsing the formula for the surface area of a sphere, $A = 4\\pi r^{2}$:\n$$A_{vesicle} = 4\\pi (25\\,\\mathrm{nm})^{2} = 4\\pi (625\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{2}) = 2500\\pi\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{2}$$\n\nTo perform the calculation, we must work in a consistent set of units, preferably SI base units.\nWe convert $C_{m}$ from $\\mu\\mathrm{F/cm}^{2}$ to $\\mathrm{F/m}^{2}$:\n$$1\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m} \\implies 1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2} = (10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m})^{2} = 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$$\n$$1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{F} = 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F}$$\n$$C_{m} = 1\\,\\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{cm}^{2}} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F}}{10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}} = 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}^{2}$$\nWe convert $A_{vesicle}$ from $\\mathrm{nm}^{2}$ to $\\mathrm{m}^{2}$:\n$$1\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m} \\implies 1\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{2} = (10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m})^{2} = 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$$\n$$A_{vesicle} = 2500\\pi\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{2} = 2500\\pi \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2} = 2.5\\pi \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in capacitance, $\\Delta C$:\n$$\\Delta C = C_{m} \\cdot A_{vesicle} = (10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}^{2}) \\cdot (2.5\\pi \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2})$$\n$$\\Delta C = 2.5\\pi \\times 10^{-17}\\,\\mathrm{F}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer in femtofarads ($\\mathrm{fF}$).

No violations of scientific principles, logical inconsistencies, or factual errors are present. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nStep 3: Proceed with Solution.\n\nThe problem requires a calculation starting from first principles. The first principle stated is that the free energies of independent processes are additive. Here, we are told that $N=3$ SNARE complexes act cooperatively. The total free energy released per fusion event, at the molecular level, is the sum of the energy released by each complex.\n\nLet $\\Delta G_{\\text{molecule, release}}$ be the energy released by $N$ complexes.\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{molecule, release}} = N \\times (\\text{energy released per complex})\n$$\nSubstituting the given values, $N=3$ and the energy per complex is $35\\,k_{B}T$:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{molecule, release}} = 3 \\times (35\\,k_{B}T) = 105\\,k_{B}T\n$$\nThis quantity represents the energy released per single fusion event, which involves a set of $3$ SNAREs.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires converting this per-molecule energy into a molar quantity, denoted as $\\Delta G_{\\text{release, mol}}$. A mole consists of $N_{A}$ (Avogadro's number) of elementary entities. Therefore, to find the energy released per mole of fusion events, we must multiply the energy per event by $N_{A}$.\n\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{release, mol}} = \\Delta G_{\\text{molecule, release}} \\times N_{A}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta G_{\\text{molecule, release}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{release, mol}} = (105\\,k_{B}T) \\times N_{A}\n$$\nBy rearranging the terms, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{release, mol}} = 105 \\times (k_{B} N_{A}) \\times T\n$$\nThe problem provides the crucial identity $k_{B}N_{A} = R$, where $R$ is the molar gas constant. Substituting this identity gives the final symbolic expression for the molar free energy released:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{release, mol}} = 105 RT\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the total molar free energy released when $N=3$ SNARE complexes form.\n\nNow, we must evaluate this expression numerically using the provided constants: $R=8.3145\\,\\text{J mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$ and $T=310\\,\\text{K}$.\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{release, mol}} = 105 \\times (8.3145\\,\\text{J mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}) \\times (310\\,\\text{K})\n$$\nThe calculation yields:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{release, mol}} = 270601.275\\,\\text{J mol}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be in units of kilojoules per mole ($\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$). To convert from $\\text{J mol}^{-1}$ to $\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$, we divide by $1000$:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{release, mol}} = \\frac{270601.275}{1000}\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1} = 270.601275\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}\n$$\nThe final answer must be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{release, mol}} \\approx 270.6\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}\n$$\n\nFor completeness, as instructed, we briefly compare this released energy with the fusion barrier. The barrier is given in the range of $40\\,k_{B}T$ to $60\\,k_{B}T$. We convert this range to molar units using the same methodology:\n$$\nE_{\\text{barrier, mol}} = (40 \\text{ to } 60) \\times RT\n$$\nLower limit: $40 \\times (8.3145\\,\\text{J mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}) \\times (310\\,\\text{K}) \\approx 103100\\,\\text{J mol}^{-1} = 103.1\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$.\nUpper limit: $60 \\times (8.3145\\,\\text{J mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}) \\times (310\\,\\text{K}) \\approx 154600\\,\\text{J mol}^{-1} = 154.6\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$.\nThe fusion barrier is therefore in the range of approximately $103.1$ to $154.6\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$.

You aim to predict the pattern of receptor-mediated endocytosis and compensatory membrane trafficking responses during this acute window.\n\nUse as foundational base the following well-tested mechanisms and definitions: Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis (RME) via Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis (CME) requires assembly of a clathrin lattice built from CHC and clathrin light chains, cargo selection by Adaptor Protein complex $2$ (AP-$2$) binding to specific cytosolic motifs and phosphoinositide $4,5$-bisphosphate (PI($4,5$)P$_2$), and coated vesicle scission by dynamin GTPase. The Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor (LDLR) and the Transferrin Receptor (TFR) are canonical CME cargos. The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) undergoes clathrin-dependent uptake at low Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) and can access clathrin-independent routes at high EGF. Cells experiencing reduced cholesterol import via LDL can activate Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein (SREBP) to increase transcription of LDLR and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Clathrin-Independent Endocytosis (CIE) includes caveolin-mediated uptake (caveolae), Arf-$6$-dependent clathrin-independent carriers/glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein-enriched early endosomal compartments (CLIC/GEEC), and macropinocytosis; these routes can be upregulated by changes in signaling, membrane composition, and cortical actin.

The roles described for $CHC$, $AP-2$, $LDLR$, $TFR$, $EGFR$, $SREBP$, and $TGN$ sorting are textbook-level knowledge.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for the predictable consequences of a single, well-defined perturbation ($CHC$ deletion) based on a specified set of rules. A unique and logical solution can be derived. The constraints (normal viability and $ATP$) are critical for isolating the specific effects of $CHC$ loss.\n-   **Objective**: The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. It provides all necessary information to deduce the phenotype without requiring external knowledge beyond what is given in the \"foundational base\". There are no contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a well-formulated question that tests the integrated application of fundamental principles in cell biology. The solution process will now commence.\n\n**Derivation of Expected Phenotype**\nThe deletion of Clathrin Heavy Chain ($CHC$) is the central perturbation. $CHC$ is the principal structural component of the clathrin triskelion, which polymerizes to form the clathrin coat. Its absence incapacitates all processes that depend on the formation of a clathrin lattice.\n\n1.  **Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis ($CME$)**: According to the givens, $CME$ requires a clathrin lattice. Deletion of $CHC$ prevents lattice formation, therefore $CME$ will be abolished.\n\n2.  **Canonical $CME$ Cargos ($TFR$, $LDLR$)**: $TFR$ and $LDLR$ are stated to be canonical $CME$ cargos. With $CME$ abolished, their primary internalization route is blocked. This will lead to their failure to internalize and subsequent accumulation at the plasma membrane. The uptake of their respective ligands, transferrin and Low-Density Lipoprotein ($LDL$), will be severely inhibited.\n\n3.  **Cholesterol Homeostasis ($SREBP$)**: The severely impaired uptake of $LDL$ will cause a cellular cholesterol deficit. As stated, reduced cholesterol import activates the $SREBP$ transcription factor. Activated $SREBP$ will upregulate the transcription of its target genes, including $LDLR$ and $HMG-CoA$ reductase. The increased synthesis of $LDLR$ will lead to even more receptor protein being trafficked to the plasma membrane, where it will remain trapped due to the endocytosis block. The upregulation of $HMG-CoA$ reductase represents a compensatory attempt to synthesize cholesterol de novo.\n\n4.  **$EGFR$ Endocytosis**: The fate of $EGFR$ depends on ligand concentration. At low $EGF$ concentrations, its uptake is clathrin-dependent. With $CHC$ deletion, this pathway is non-functional. Consequently, $EGFR$ will be retained on the cell surface, leading to prolonged signaling and delayed degradation (downregulation). At high $EGF$ concentrations, $EGFR$ can use clathrin-independent routes. Therefore, some internalization can still occur via pathways such as macropinocytosis or other $CIE$ mechanisms, constituting a partial rescue of uptake.\n\n5.  **$TGN$ Sorting**: The givens state that clathrin, in conjunction with the $AP-1$ adaptor, is required for sorting of lysosomal hydrolases at the $TGN$. The clathrin coats at the $TGN$ also require $CHC$. Thus, $CHC$ deletion will disrupt this sorting mechanism. Lysosomal enzymes, failing to be packaged into clathrin-coated vesicles destined for the endo-lysosomal system, will be missorted into the constitutive secretory pathway and secreted from the cell.\n\n6.  **Compensatory Pathways**: A block in a major trafficking pathway like $CME$ often triggers compensatory responses. The cell must still internalize nutrients and regulate its surface composition. It is highly probable that one or more $CIE$ pathways (e.g., Arf-$6$-dependent $CLIC/GEEC$ pathway, macropinocytosis) will be upregulated to partially compensate for the loss of $CME$.\n\n7.  **Membrane Homeostasis**: Endocytosis and exocytosis are coupled to maintain plasma membrane surface area and tension. A drastic reduction in endocytosis (due to $CME$ block) while exocytosis continues would lead to an increase in surface area and a decrease in membrane tension. The cell must respond. One described response to low tension is a transient increase in exocytosis. After this acute phase, a longer-term adaptation would likely involve downregulating the rate of exocytosis to match the new, lower rate of endocytosis. Thus, a transient perturbation of exocytosis is expected.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Near-complete loss of TFR and LDLR internalization with accumulation of these receptors at the plasma membrane; activation of SREBP with increased surface LDLR but continued poor LDL uptake; reduced clathrin-dependent EGFR internalization at low EGF with prolonged surface signaling and delayed downregulation, but partial EGFR uptake at high EGF via clathrin-independent pathways (for example macropinocytosis); upregulation of Arf-6-dependent CIE (for example CLIC/GEEC) and macropinocytosis as compensatory uptake routes, with at most modest caveolar contribution; impaired TGN clathrin sorting leading to missorting and secretion of some lysosomal hydrolases; and a transient increase in exocytosis to buffer plasma membrane tension when endocytic retrieval falls.**\nThis option cohesively integrates all the logical consequences derived from the problem statement. It correctly predicts the effects on $CME$ cargos ($TFR$, $LDLR$), the ensuing activation of $SREBP$, the dual behavior of $EGFR$, the impairment of $TGN$ sorting, the upregulation of compensatory $CIE$ pathways, and a plausible, nuanced response of the exocytic machinery to maintain membrane homeostasis. Every point is consistent with our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Global increase in all forms of endocytosis due to removal of a steric barrier imposed by clathrin lattices; increased transferrin and LDL uptake; accelerated EGFR degradation; suppression of SREBP; and decreased exocytosis to reduce surface area.**\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. The primary role of clathrin is to *drive* endocytosis, not to sterically hinder it. Its removal *abolishes* $CME$, leading to a massive *decrease* in total endocytosis, not an increase. Consequently, $TFR$/$LDL$ uptake would decrease, not increase. $EGFR$ degradation at low ligand would be slowed, not accelerated. $SREBP$ would be activated, not suppressed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Selective impairment of caveolin-mediated uptake while clathrin-dependent RME proceeds because dynamin can substitute for clathrin; transferrin and LDL internalization remain normal; EGFR internalization and downregulation remain unchanged; and no compensatory endocytic pathways are induced.**\nThis option displays a profound misunderstanding of molecular roles. The perturbation is a $CHC$ deletion, which will impair $CME$, not caveolin-mediated uptake. The assertion that dynamin can substitute for clathrin is nonsensical; they perform different, non-interchangeable functions (scission versus coat formation). As $CME$ is blocked, $TFR$ and $LDLR$ internalization will not be normal.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Complete abolition of all forms of endocytosis including macropinocytosis and phagocytosis; compensatory massive upregulation of exocytosis that restores LDL uptake by secreting LDL into endosomes; and normal lysosomal hydrolase targeting from the TGN.**\nThis option contains several scientifically bankrupt statements. First, $CHC$ deletion only affects clathrin-dependent processes; clathrin-independent pathways like macropinocytosis will not be abolished. Second, the proposed mechanism of \"secreting $LDL$ into endosomes\" is biologically impossible. Exocytosis releases contents extracellularly, and cells endocytose material from the outside. Third, as established, $TGN$ sorting of lysosomal hydrolases is clathrin-dependent and would be impaired, not normal.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2780219"}]}
