Let $N_{E}(t)$ be the number of enzyme molecules in the ER and $N_{G}(t)$ be the number of enzyme molecules in the Golgi at time $t$. The total number of enzyme molecules, $N_{T}$, is constant. This is expressed by the conservation law:\n$$N_{E}(t) + N_{G}(t) = N_{T}$$\n\nThe transport processes are described by first-order kinetics. The rate of forward transport from the ER to the Golgi is proportional to the number of molecules in the ER, with a rate constant $k_{esc}$.

The rate of change of molecules in each compartment is the rate of inflow minus the rate of outflow.\n\nFor the Golgi compartment, the rate of change is:\n$$\\frac{dN_{G}}{dt} = (\\text{Flux from ER to Golgi}) - (\\text{Flux from Golgi to ER})$$\n$$\\frac{dN_{G}}{dt} = k_{esc} N_{E}(t) - k_{ret} N_{G}(t)$$\n\nSimilarly, for the ER compartment:\n$$\\frac{dN_{E}}{dt} = (\\text{Flux from Golgi to ER}) - (\\text{Flux from ER to Golgi})$$\n$$\\frac{dN_{E}}{dt} = k_{ret} N_{G}(t) - k_{esc} N_{E}(t)$$\nNote that $\\frac{dN_{E}}{dt} + \\frac{dN_{G}}{dt} = 0$, which is consistent with the conservation of the total number of molecules $N_{T}$.\n\nThe problem requires finding the steady-state fraction of the enzyme in the Golgi. The definition of steady state is that the populations in the compartments no longer change with time. Mathematically, this means the time derivatives are zero.

By the default flow of the secretory pathway, soluble proteins lacking a lysosomal targeting determinant are secreted to the extracellular medium. For lysosomal hydrolases, the canonical determinant is mannose-6-phosphate (M6P), installed on N-linked oligosaccharides by UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase). Mannose-6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) bind M6P-bearing hydrolases and sort them to endosomes, and MPRs at the plasma membrane can recapture secreted, M6P-bearing hydrolases by endocytosis.
