The problem is self-contained, consistent, and does not violate any physical or mathematical principles.\n\n**Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be formulated based on the provided principles.\n\n**Solution Formulation**\nThe problem requires the calculation of two quantities: the relative growth rate, $\\dot{\\epsilon}$, and the absolute axial length increase, $\\Delta L$.\n\nFirst, we address the relative growth rate, $\\dot{\\epsilon}$. The problem states that the axial strain rate (which is synonymous with the relative growth rate) is proportional to the excess turgor pressure above the yield threshold. This relationship is formalized as:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon} = \\phi (P - Y) $$\nThis equation is applicable only if the turgor pressure exceeds the yield threshold, i.e., $P > Y$. The given values are $P = 0.60$ MPa and $Y = 0.40$ MPa. Since $0.60 > 0.40$, the condition for growth is met. We can now substitute the given values into the equation:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon} = (5 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ s}^{-1} \\text{ MPa}^{-1}) \\times (0.60 \\text{ MPa} - 0.40 \\text{ MPa}) $$\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon} = (5 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ s}^{-1} \\text{ MPa}^{-1}) \\times (0.20 \\text{ MPa}) $$\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ s}^{-1} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the relative growth rate is $\\dot{\\epsilon} = 1.000 \\times 10^{-6}$ s$^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we compute the absolute axial length increase, $\\Delta L$. The axial strain rate, $\\dot{\\epsilon}$, is defined as the instantaneous rate of change of length, $\\frac{dL}{dt}$, per unit length, $L$:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon} = \\frac{1}{L} \\frac{dL}{dt} $$\nSince the problem states that $P$, $Y$, and $\\phi$ are constant, the relative growth rate $\\dot{\\epsilon}$ is also constant over the time interval of interest. We can solve this first-order ordinary differential equation by separation of variables:\n$$ \\frac{dL}{L} = \\dot{\\epsilon} \\, dt $$\nWe integrate this equation from the initial state (length $L_0$ at time $t=0$) to the final state (length $L(t)$ at time $t$):\n$$ \\int_{L_0}^{L(t)} \\frac{1}{L'} dL' = \\int_0^t \\dot{\\epsilon} \\, dt' $$\n$$ \\ln(L(t)) - \\ln(L_0) = \\dot{\\epsilon} t $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{L(t)}{L_0}\\right) = \\dot{\\epsilon} t $$\nSolving for the length at time $t$, $L(t)$, yields the equation for exponential growth:\n$$ L(t) = L_0 \\exp(\\dot{\\epsilon} t) $$\nThe absolute axial length increase, $\\Delta L$, is the difference between the final length and the initial length:\n$$ \\Delta L = L(t) - L_0 = L_0 \\exp(\\dot{\\epsilon} t) - L_0 = L_0 (\\exp(\\dot{\\epsilon} t) - 1) $$\nTo perform the calculation, we must ensure all units are consistent. The time interval is given as $t = 2.00$ hours. We must convert this to seconds to match the units of $\\dot{\\epsilon}$:\n$$ t = 2.00 \\text{ h} \\times \\frac{3600 \\text{ s}}{1 \\text{ h}} = 7200 \\text{ s} $$\nNow, we substitute the values for $L_0$, $\\dot{\\epsilon}$, and $t$ into the expression for $\\Delta L$:\n$$ \\Delta L = (5.00 \\text{ mm}) \\times \\left( \\exp\\left( (1.000 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ s}^{-1}) \\times (7200 \\text{ s}) \\right) - 1 \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta L = 5.00 \\times (\\exp(0.007200) - 1) $$\nCalculating the value of the expression:\n$$ \\exp(0.007200) \\approx 1.00722597 $$\n$$ \\Delta L \\approx 5.00 \\times (1.00722597 - 1) = 5.00 \\times 0.00722597 $$\n$$ \\Delta L \\approx 0.03612985 \\text{ mm} $$\nRounding this result to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ \\Delta L = 0.03613 \\text{ mm} $$\nThe two requested quantities are $\\dot{\\epsilon} = 1.000 \\times 10^{-6}$ s$^{-1}$ and $\\Delta L = 0.03613$ mm.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.000 \\times 10^{-6} & 0.03613\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2824140"}, {"introduction": "While the basic Lockhart model describes overall expansion, plant cells rarely grow isotropically, instead forming complex shapes through directional, or anisotropic, growth.

The derivation will proceed in three logical steps as stipulated by the problem.\n\nFirst, we establish the principal wall stresses using static force balance for a thin-walled, closed-end cylindrical pressure vessel. The vessel has radius $R$, wall thickness $h$, and is subjected to an internal turgor pressure $P$.\nThe circumferential stress, or hoop stress, $\\sigma_{\\theta}$, is found by considering a longitudinal section of the cylinder.

The force exerted by the pressure on the circular end-cap area $\\pi R^2$ must be balanced by the tensile force in the annular cross-section of the wall, $\\sigma_{z} (2 \\pi R h)$.\n$$\nP \\cdot (\\pi R^2) = \\sigma_{z} \\cdot (2 \\pi R h)\n$$\nSolving for $\\sigma_{z}$ yields the axial stress:\n$$\n\\sigma_{z} = \\frac{PR^2}{2 \\pi R h} = \\frac{PR}{2h}\n$$\n\nSecond, we relate the principal irreversible strain rates, $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{z}$ and $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\theta}$, to the macroscopic rates of change of length $L$ and radius $R$. The axial strain rate $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{z}$ is the fractional rate of change of length. For finite deformation, this corresponds to the rate of change of the natural logarithm of length.\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{z} = \\frac{1}{L}\\frac{dL}{dt} = \\frac{d(\\ln L)}{dt}\n$$\nSimilarly, the circumferential strain rate $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\theta}$ is the fractional rate of change of the circumference, $C = 2\\pi R$.\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{C}\\frac{dC}{dt} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi R}\\frac{d(2\\pi R)}{dt} = \\frac{1}{R}\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\frac{d(\\ln R)}{dt}\n$$\nWith these relations, the growth anisotropy $\\alpha$ is simply the ratio of the principal strain rates:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{z}}{\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\theta}}\n$$\n\nThird, we employ the specified tensorial Lockhart relation for irreversible growth. This constitutive law connects the strain rate in each principal direction to the corresponding principal stress, provided the stress exceeds a yield threshold $\\sigma_{Y}$. The problem states we are in the regime where $\\sigma_{z} > \\sigma_{Y}$ and $\\sigma_{\\theta} > \\sigma_{Y}$.

CalS has the largest possible radius ($15 \\text{ nm}$) but suffers from a reduced PD density ($0.8 \\, n_0$), resulting in a lower permeability factor ($180 \\, n_0$). WT has the lowest permeability due to significant callose constriction ($r = 9 \\text{ nm}$). The statement that WT+Glu maximizes \"$r$ and thus $n \\, r^2$\" contains a minor imprecision; CalS maximizes $r$, but WT+Glu maximizes the product $n \\, r^2$, which is the relevant quantity.
