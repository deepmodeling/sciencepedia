The measured partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood is $P_{a O_2} = 100$ mmHg. The solubility coefficient of oxygen in blood plasma is $\\alpha_{O_2} = 0.003$ mL O$_2$/dL/mmHg. The hemoglobin concentration is $[\\text{Hb}] = 15$ g/dL. The oxygen saturation of arterial hemoglobin is $S_{a O_2} = 0.97$. The oxygen-binding capacity of hemoglobin at full saturation is $1.34$ mL O$_2$/g Hb. Using only the following foundational bases:\n- Henry’s law for dissolved gases stating that, at constant temperature, the concentration of a dissolved gas is proportional to its partial pressure in the gas phase.\n- The definition of oxygen content bound to hemoglobin as the product of hemoglobin concentration, its specific oxygen-binding capacity at full saturation, and the fractional saturation.\nderive from first principles the dissolved oxygen content per deciliter, the hemoglobin-bound oxygen content per deciliter, and the total oxygen content per deciliter. Then, compute the fraction $f$ of the total arterial oxygen content that is physically dissolved in plasma, where $f$ is defined as the ratio of dissolved oxygen content to the total oxygen content (dissolved plus hemoglobin-bound). Provide your final result as a unitless decimal rounded to $4$ significant figures. In your reasoning, explain why the dissolved component is negligible relative to hemoglobin-bound oxygen under these conditions. Only report the final value of $f$ as your answer.", "solution": "The task is to calculate three quantities related to oxygen transport in arterial blood and then a final ratio. We will address each component in a logical sequence, deriving them from the first principles specified.\n\nFirst, we calculate the content of oxygen physically dissolved in the plasma, which we denote as $C_{dissolved, O_2}$. According to Henry's law, the concentration of a dissolved gas is directly proportional to its partial pressure. The proportionality constant is the solubility coefficient, $\\alpha_{O_2}$. The given values are the partial pressure of arterial oxygen, $P_{aO_2} = 100 \\text{ mmHg}$, and the solubility coefficient, $\\alpha_{O_2} = 0.003 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{dL/mmHg}$.\n\nThe formula is therefore:\n$$C_{dissolved, O_2} = \\alpha_{O_2} \\times P_{aO_2}$$\nSubstituting the provided numerical values:\n$$C_{dissolved, O_2} = (0.003) \\times (100) = 0.3 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{dL}$$\nThis quantity represents the amount of oxygen carried in each deciliter of blood purely in physical solution.\n\nSecond, we calculate the content of oxygen chemically bound to hemoglobin, denoted as $C_{bound, O_2}$. The problem states this is the product of the hemoglobin concentration, $[\\text{Hb}]$, its specific oxygen-binding capacity at full saturation, which we will call $O_2\\text{Cap}_{Hb}$, and the fractional oxygen saturation of hemoglobin, $S_{a O_2}$. The given values are $[\\text{Hb}] = 15 \\text{ g/dL}$, $O_2\\text{Cap}_{Hb} = 1.34 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{g Hb}$, and $S_{a O_2} = 0.97$.\n\nThe formula is:\n$$C_{bound, O_2} = [\\text{Hb}] \\times O_2\\text{Cap}_{Hb} \\times S_{a O_2}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$C_{bound, O_2} = (15) \\times (1.34) \\times (0.97)$$\nFirst, we find the maximum amount of oxygen that can be bound if hemoglobin were fully saturated:\n$$(15 \\text{ g/dL}) \\times (1.34 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{g Hb}) = 20.1 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{dL}$$\nThis is the total oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin in this blood sample. Since the hemoglobin is only $97\\%$ saturated, the actual amount of bound oxygen is:\n$$C_{bound, O_2} = (20.1) \\times (0.97) = 19.497 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{dL}$$\n\nThird, we find the total arterial oxygen content, $C_{aO_2}$, which is the sum of the dissolved and hemoglobin-bound components.\n$$C_{aO_2} = C_{dissolved, O_2} + C_{bound, O_2}$$\n$$C_{aO_2} = 0.3 + 19.497 = 19.797 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{dL}$$\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute the fraction $f$ of the total arterial oxygen content that is physically dissolved in plasma. This is the ratio of the dissolved oxygen content to the total oxygen content.\n$$f = \\frac{C_{dissolved, O_2}}{C_{aO_2}}$$\nUsing our calculated values:\n$$f = \\frac{0.3}{19.797} \\approx 0.015153811$$\nThe problem requires this value rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$f \\approx 0.01515$$\n\nThe explanation for why the dissolved component is considered negligible relative to the hemoglobin-bound component is now quantitatively obvious. The amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin ($19.497 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{dL}$) is approximately $65$ times greater than the amount physically dissolved in plasma ($0.3 \\text{ mL O}_2/\\text{dL}$). The fraction $f \\approx 0.01515$ corresponds to only about $1.5\\%$ of the total oxygen carried. This vast difference underscores the biological necessity of a specialized oxygen transport molecule like hemoglobin. The low solubility of oxygen gas in an aqueous medium like blood plasma is insufficient to meet the metabolic demands of the body's tissues. While the dissolved fraction is small, it is not physiologically irrelevant. It is the dissolved oxygen that exerts a partial pressure, $P_{O_2}$, which creates the gradient for gas diffusion across membranes and determines the loading state of hemoglobin according to the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve. Thus, the dissolved pool is in dynamic equilibrium with the much larger hemoglobin-bound pool, acting as the immediate source and sink for oxygen exchange.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.01515}$$", "id": "2833942"}, {"introduction": "While oxygen transport is vital, the efficient removal of carbon dioxide is equally critical for maintaining homeostasis.
